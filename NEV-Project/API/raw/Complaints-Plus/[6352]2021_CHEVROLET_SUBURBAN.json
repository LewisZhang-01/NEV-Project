The starter was bad,  the fuse box was bad but the major issue was in the engine where the lifters went out.  To have the lifters go out at less than miles is unacceptable.  The dealer commented that they are seeing this issue constantly from 2021 Chevy SUVs.  This is a major safety issue in that there is no was to put my 2021 suburban in neutral when this happens to clear the vehicle from a busy highway.  Please investigate this.",
