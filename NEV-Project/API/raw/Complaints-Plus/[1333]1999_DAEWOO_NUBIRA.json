THEY COMPARED MY CAR VERSUS A NEWER MODEL (WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION) AND THEY FOUND THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT I FACED.  THEY USED THE CRUISE CONTROL AND FOUND THAT THE CAR HAS A JERKING ACTION WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN ITS CRUISING SPEED.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY FILLED OUT A \"TECH REPORT\" AND THAT IN FUTURE MODELS THEY WILL WORK ON THE PROBLEM.  I REALLY DO LIKE MY CAR, BUT I CANNOT STAND THE JERKING ACTION.  I DON'T KNOW IF OTHERS HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM OR IF IT IS JUST A COUPLE OF NUBIRAS THAT EXPERIENCE THESE PROBLEMS.  EITHER WAY, I CONSIDER THIS A DEFECT IN THE CRUISE CONTROL AND ACCELERATION/DECREASE OF SPEED.
