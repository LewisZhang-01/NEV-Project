        "summary": "While driving on a clear day on a Virginia State Highway at about 50 mph on Sunday, May 16, 2021, my wife and I heard and felt a very loud explosion as if the car had been hit by a very large object.  We observed no immediate damage, saw no debris bounce off the car and the car that was closely following us made no evasive movements as if there was debris in their path.  We stopped within a few hundred yards and noticed that the rear 10 inches or so of the moonroof had simply exploded.  The glass was buckled up and shattered.    We were not injured and the car functioned normally.  We are taking it to the Range Rover dealer this morning and they advise me it is not covered by the warranty.  My insurance company, USAA, will most likely pay the cost of repair, which is estimated at $5500.  I am convinced this was caused by a defect in the glass or faulty design or manufacture.   In my view, this is a serious defect with the potential to cause serious injury.",

WHEN I EXITED THE VEHICLE, I WAS STANDING IN THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND THE OPEN DRIVER'S DOOR, AND THE CAR UNEXPECTEDLY ROLLED IN REVERSE.  I DID NOT HEAR OR SEE ANY WARNINGS AT ANY TIME THAT ALERTED ME THAT I WAS IN ANY DANGER.    I QUICKLY TRIED TO GET BACK INTO THE CAR TO STOP IT (MY 4-YR-OLD SON WAS INSIDE) AND, WHEN TRYING TO GET BACK IN, I WAS PUSHED OUT, FELL TO THE GROUND, AND FOUND MYSELF FIGHTING WITH THE DOOR AND THE TIRE COMING TOWARD MY HEAD AND BODY.      I STUCK MY RIGHT HAND INTO THE CAR TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH MY HAND.  ULTIMATELY, MY RIGHT HAND FELL OUT OF THE CAR, AND THE CAR ROLLED OVER AND CRUSHED IT.  THE DRIVER'S DOOR HIT MY HEAD, WHICH CAUSED A CONCUSSION AND BLEEDING.  THE CAR DRAGGED ME FROM THE GARAGE INTO THE DRIVEWAY, CAUSING TIRE BURNS AND SCRAPES ON MY BODY.  ULTIMATELY, THE CAR STOPPED WHEN IT ROLLED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND HIT A POST ACROSS THE STREET.    I WAS THEN TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE, WHERE THEY RAN MULTIPLE TESTS ON MY ENTIRE BODY AND DIAGNOSED MY CONCUSSION AND BROKEN HAND.  I HAVE SINCE HAD TO UNDERGO RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY ON MY RIGHT, DOMINANT HAND AS THE BONES IN MY HAND WERE CRUSHED BY THE VEHICLE'S TIRE.",
