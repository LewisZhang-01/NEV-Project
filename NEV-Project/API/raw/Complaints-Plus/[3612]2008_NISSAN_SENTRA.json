THE VEHICLE IS BEYOND WARRANTY HOWEVER, BECAUSE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE REGARDING FAULTY HARDWARE, I FEEL NISSAN SHOULD GRACIOUSLY ADDRESS THIS WITHOUT CHARGE. THERE ARE AIRBAG RECALL CAMPAIGNS OPEN FOR OTHER NISSAN MODELS REGARDING THIS VERY ISSUE BUT IT UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT INCLUDE MY 2008 NISSAN SENTRA. THE RECALL OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED! AT THIS POINT I MAY BE FORCED TO ACQUIRE A USED SEAT AT A LOCAL JUNK YARD, BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE SENSOR IS WORKING IN THE USED SEAT PRIOR TO INSTALLATION. AGAIN, THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED PROMPTLY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!",

I TOOK THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY STATED THAT IT WAS THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND IT WOULD COST $500.

I CONTACTED NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE TO EXPLORE WHY AT 72,000 MILES THE CAR NEEDS THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR REPLACE AND WAS THIS A COMMON OCCURRENCE. THEY DID NOT HELP; HAD LIMITED ANSWERS AND STATED THAT THEY WILL CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP IN 3 TO 5 BUSINESS DAYS REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND EXPLANATION. I DECIDED TO GET THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR REPLACED SOMEWHERE ELSE. HOWEVER, TODAY THE CAR STALLED AGAIN AND NOW THE ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AGAIN. I AM RETURNING THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC THAT REPLACED THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR. HOWEVER, I BELIEF THERE ARE MORE ELECTRICAL/ENGINE PROBLEMS WITH THE NISSAN SENTRA 2008 BESIDES THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT BEING FORTHCOMING ABOUT AND THIS CAN PUT MY LIFE AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD IN DANGER.

I ONLY PUT 19,000 MILES ON THESE NEW TIRES. WAS TOLD IF I REPLACE THE TIRES THIS WILL JUST HAPPEN AGAIN & AGAIN.  NISSAN INSPECTED THE CAR AND SAID THE REAR MEMBER IS NOT DAMAGED OR BENT BUT THE CAR IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THESE CAR WERE BUILT SO THAT THE REAR IS FIXED & CANNOT BE ALIGNED ONLY THE FRONT CAN BE ALIGNED. THEIR SUGGESTION IS TO ADD SHIMS TO THE REAR TO HELP THE CAR TO RIDE BETTER & BE MORE IN ALIGNMENT AND THAT SHOULD HELP THE PROBLEM IT IS CREATING WITH THE REAR TIRES CUPPING. WHEN I PURCHASED MY CAR THEY CONVINCED ME TO ALSO PURCHASED A RATHER EXPENSIVE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS SAID TO COVER ALMOST EVERYTHING. NOW I AM TOLD THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THIS ( BECAUSE IT IS AN ADD ON PART, NOT A REPLACEMENT PART) AND THAT I AM EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THIS. FIRST OF ALL THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BANDAID FIX TO A PROBLEM NISSAN SHOULD BE ADDRESSING IF THIS PART OF THE VEHICLE IS FAULTY. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY DAMAGE OR ACCIDENT TO THE REAR OF MY CAR THAT WOULD CAUSE THIS. IT CLEARLY IS SOME SORT OF DEFECT. NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD MAKE A CAR THAT CANNOT BE ALIGNED IN BACK.

AS SHE WAS BACKING UP TO PARK SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.  I TRIED TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND NOTICED A PS  LIGHT ON THE DASH BOARD.  I TOOK OVER AND TRIED TO MANEUVER THE CAR AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.   I THEN TURNED THE CAR OFF AND OPEN THE HOOD TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM BUT SAW NO VISUAL DEFECTS.  I THEN GOT BACK IN THE CAR, STARTED IT UP AND THE PS LIGHT WAS GONE AND THE POWER STEERING WAS WORKING AGAIN.  WHEN WE GOT HOME I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL AND FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE STEERING OF THE SENTRA BUT NO RECALL.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THE SENTRA ONLY THE NISSAN XTERRA AND FRONTIER HAVE BEEN RECALLED.       I BOUGHT A NISSAN ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO AND HAD THE BEST EXPERIENCE WITH MY VEHICLE AND PUT MY TRUST IN THEM TO ENSURE MY DAUGHTER HAD THE BEST AND SAFEST VEHICLE ON THE ROAD BUT LITTLE DID I KNOW THEY NO LONGER ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  MY DAUGHTER COULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THAT VEHICLE WHEN IT STOPPED WORKING AND CAUSED A FATAL ACCIDENT FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT NO ONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN LIFE ANYMORE IT'S ALL ABOUT PROFIT.  NOW I'VE GOT TO FIND MY DAUGHTER ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE I'VE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE NISSAN COMPANY.  I'D RATHER TAKE A LOSS OF MONEY THEN A LOSS OF LIFE.  THANKS NISSAN.  *TR",

I ADVISED THE SERVICE MANAGER OF THIS AND HE AND OTHERS VERIFIED THAT ALL THE SENTRAS WITH THIS OPTION HAD THE SAME TOO LARGE MIRROR.
