BEING A MECHANIC, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO CHECK THE RELAYS AND FUSES TO SEE IF THEY WERE BLOWN OR BAD.  TO MY DISMAY, I COULD NOT FIND ANY RELAYS!

THIS ALLOWS LIMITED BRAKING WITH THE BRAKE SECTION THAT HAS NOT LOST ITS FLUID. THE 2ND ISSUE IS THAT THE REAR BRAKES LINE RUNS IN THE FRAME RAIL BETWEEN THE FUEL TANK. THE FUEL TANK IS CONSTANTLY SWEATING ON HUMID DAYS WHICH SUBJECTS THE BRAKE LINES TO CONSTANT RUSTING. UNTIL THEY RUST THROUGH. I MAY TAKE SEVERAL YEARS.

THE TRUCK WAS CUSTOMIZED AS I HAD BOUGHT IT IN 1997 AND THE CUSTOMIZATION HAS NEVER INTERFERED WITH THE OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE.  MY INSURANCE COMPANY HAS A PICTURE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND ALSO A PICTURE OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE TIRE.  UNFORTUNATELY, I REPLACED THE TIRES (ALL FOUR) BEFORE I KNEW THAT BRIDGESTONE WAS THE SAME MANUFACTURER AS FIRESTONE.  THE TIRES COULD NOT BE RECOVERED FROM THE STORE THAT REPLACED THEM.  THE REASON I REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES IS BECAUSE I DID NOT TRUST BRIDGESTONE DUELER H/T ANYMORE.*AK (DOT NUMBER: UNKNOWN  TIRESIZE: 265/75R16)",
