After shifting to Park, the key can be turned to position 1 (ACC) but will not turn all the way to position 0 (OFF) and therefore the key cannot be removed from the steering column. So far I have been able to temporarily resolve the problem by re-starting and stopping the engine several times. The number of times the cycle must be repeated is not consistent. On one occasion, the driver was not able to remove the key so the key was left in position 1 for several hours. This resulted in a drained battery and the truck would not start.
