HE TOLD ME I NEEDED A NEW BATTERY (THOUGH THE CURRENT BATTERY WAS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD) BECAUSE THE CURRENT ONE WASN'T HOLDING A CHARGE. I TOLD HIM TO PUT ONE ON. HE TOLD ME THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE AND READY TO GO. I ASSUMED -- IT NOW TURNS OUT, WRONGLY -- THAT THE KIA MECHANIC HAD TIGHTENED WHATEVER BOLT HE FOUND LOOSE. I PICKED UP THE CAR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND DROVE IT STRAIGHT HOME. WHEN I STARTED IT YESTERDAY MORNING TO LEAVE FOR WORK, I DROVE IT ABOUT 1.5 BLOCKS AND THE STEERING LOCKED UP, THE BRAKE AND BATTERY WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON, AND IT FELT LIKE THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON. THIS TIME THE ENGINE KEPT RUNNING. I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME AND CALLED THE KIA GARAGE BACK. WAYNE NOW ADMITS THE MECHANIC NEVER LOOKED FOR AN UNDERLYING CAUSE. HE SIMPLY PUT THE OLD DRIVE BELTS ON AND A NEW BATTERY IN. TODAY HE SAYS IT NEEDS A NEW CRANK PULLEY. *TR",

AS I STARTED TO LEAVE THE DEALERSHIP LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND VEHICLE IS THERE AGAIN.  OBVIOUSLY MECHANICS AT DEALERS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THESE PROBLEMS AND CANNOT FIX THEM.  I FEEL THAT KIA SHOULD BUY EVERYONE OUT OF THEIR SORENTOS PLUS GIVE THEM THE  VALUE OF THE VEHICLE (WITHOUT DEDUCTING FOR PROBLEMS) PLUS A 15% COMPENSATION FOR PUTTING THE CUSTOMERS THROUGH THIS OR MAYBE PUT A BRAND NEW ENGINE IN VEHICLE.  A NEW ENGINE OR REMANUFACTURED ENGINE WAS REPLACED IN THIS VEHICLE BACK IN AUGUST, 2006.  I ORIGINALLY PUT MY DATE DOWN AS MARCH, BUT LOOKING BACK, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE FEBRUARY!!

I WAS GOING UP TO THE 4TH FLOOR WHERE I PARK, AND WHEN I TURNED LEFT ON THE 3RD FLOOR, THE CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL, KEPT GOING ROUND, AND I COULD NOT STOP. LUCKILY AGAIN, IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT THERE WERE NO CARS IN THAT FLOOR. SURELY, A SAFETY-RELATED DEFECT EXISTS. WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY ALMOST GOT ME KILLED. IT HAS HAPPENED ONLY TWICE IN ALL THESE YEARS, BUT, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE ON THIS CAR AGAIN. I CANNOT TAKE ANY OTHER CHANCE OF BEING KILLED BECAUSE OF A CAR'S DEFECT.

LUCKILY THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR SERIOUS DAMAGE.  AT THE END OF THIS LETTER WILL BE ALL THE PARTICULARS. WE WERE COMING  FROM SANTA CRUZ ON HIGHWAY 1, IN CALIFORNIA AND AT WHAT IS CALLED THE SUMMIT, OF I STARTED SEEING SMOKE IN BACK OF OUR VEHICLE. WE STOPPED, TURNED OFF THE CAR ,OPENED THE  HOOD AND THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE DOWN ON THE DRIVER SIDE NEAR THE EXHAUST  MANIFOLD. I CLOSED THE HOOD AND TRIED TO LOCATE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.   THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED ITSELF AND WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  AFTER A DAY OF TESTING THE ONLY THING THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE  TRANSMISSION WAS SLIGHTLY OVERFILLED, WHICH WAS MY ERROR.  WHILE I REALIZE THAT CAN  CAUSE THE PROBLEM HERE IS MY CONCERN.  THE TECHNICIAN WHO WORKED ON MY CAR SAID THAT TRANSMISSIONS ARE DESIGNED  TO BLOW OUT OR THROUGH OVERFLOW THE TRANSMISSION FILLER TUBE. HE ALSO  SHOWED ME THAT ON TOP OF THE DIPSTICK WAS SLOT WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE  FLUID TO ESCAPE. HOWEVER IT IS LOCATED RIGHT OVER THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT SHOULD BE LOCATED WHERE THE FLUID WOULD NOT COME  IN CONTACT WITH SUCH HOT ENGINE PARTS. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS AFFECTS OTHER  VEHICLES BUT IT DOES CONCERN ME.  MY VEHICLE IS  2004 KIA SORENTO  6 CYC, AUTOMATIC  WE WERE NOT TOWING ANYTHING NOR WHERE WE LOADED DOWN.  I THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME.
