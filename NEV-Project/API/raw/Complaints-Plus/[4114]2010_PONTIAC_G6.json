With the sensor malfunctioning, we experienced intermittent loss of power steering as well as shaking in the steering column which made it suddenly VERY difficult to steer. We lost power steering mid-drive many times and could have been killed because of this issue. The vehicle would be functioning completely normally and all of a sudden lose power steering mid-turn or while backing up and become nearly impossible to control. The problem was corrected out of pocket from us by a GM dealership service center. Unknown if it has been inspected. The dash light \"ESC\" would come on AS the power steering disengaged, but not until then. The dash display would also show \"power steering\" after we lost the power steering, but not before as a warning or anything.",

THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE MECHANIC SHOP ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE \"PROBLEM\" WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE STEERING PROBLEM FOR EARLIER MODELS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE RECALL. HOWEVER, SINCE THE 2010 MODEL YEAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NHTSA RECALL, THE COST TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM FALLS TO THE CONSUMER AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE $2,200 TO $4,000 RANGE. THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND MIRRORS THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC'S AS EARLIER MODELS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. I HAVE CONTACTED GM REGARDING THIS MATTER AND HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT A LOCAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE CONTACTING ME WITHIN 48 HOURS.     WHILE I APPRECIATE GM'S WILLINGNESS TO \"CONSIDER\" THE MATTER, I URGE THE NHTSA TO RE-VISIT THE MODEL YEARS SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE \"PROBLEM\" WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE STEERING PROBLEM FOR EARLIER MODELS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE 2010 MODEL YEAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NHTSA RECALL, THE COST TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM FALLS TO THE CONSUMER AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE $1,800 TO $2,000 RANGE.  THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND MIRRORS THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC'S AS EARLIER MODELS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  I HAVE CONTACTED GM REGARDING THIS MATTER AND HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT A LOCAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE CONTACTING ME WITHIN 48 HOURS.      WHILE I APPRECIATE GM'S WILLINGNESS TO \"CONSIDER\" THE MATTER, I URGE THE NHTSA TO RE-VISIT THE MODEL YEARS SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.

THIS WOULD POP UP SPORADICALLY SOMETIMES MULTIPLE WEEKS WITHOUT OUT A PROBLEM.

I IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE WHEEL WITH BOTH HANDS AND WITH EVERYTHING I HAD I STEERED THE CAR AND GOT PULLED OVER TO SAFETY ON THE SIDE OFF THE ROAD. I WAS HAPPY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN JUST 3 MILES FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AS I WOULD HAVE HAD TO NEGOTIATE A SET OF CURVES THAT I'M ALMOST CERTAIN WOULD HAVE REQUIRED MORE STEERING WHEEL ROTATION AND MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT.
