WE HAVE REPLACED THE SWITCH ( AS THE DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED) BUT IT DID NOT HELP, ( 89.00) THEN WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A MOTOR SO WE REPLACED THAT AT 110.00,  NO DIFFERENCE, THE RELAYS ARE GOOD AN NOW THEY THINK IT IS THE COMPUTER. 600.00.

MINIVANS CARRY WHOLE FAMILIES, AND CAN CARRY THEM ALL TO THEIR DEATHS  IF THIS HAPPENS IN A DOWNPOUR AND THE WIPERS STOP WITHOUT WARNING. IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT COMPANIES LIKE DODGE ARE ALLOWED TO PRODUCE VEHICLES LIKE THIS AND NOT OFFER SUPPORT IN FIXING THEM OR EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR SURE.

IS THERE ANYONE I CAN WRITE TO PUT PRESSURE ON DODGE TO QUIT PRODUCING THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES AND TO MAYBE COME UP WITH A BETTER ANSWER TO OUR WIPER PROBLEMS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPUTER CONTROLLED AND OUR LIVES ARE HANGING IN THE BALANCE OF A GLITCH IN SOMETHING SO SIMPLE AS WIPERS BUT SOMETHING SO BASIC AND SO NEEDED?

LUCKILY MY SON WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TRAVEL A FEW MILES WITHOUT THIRD GEAR TO A CHRYSLER REPAIR SHOP. SINCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSED WE HAD TO RENT A VAN TO COMPLETE THE TRIP AND RETURN ON MONDAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. THE REPAIRS WERE NOT COVERED UNDER A WARRANTY BECAUSE CHRYSLER GAVE ME A 6 YEAR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN 7 YEARS SINCE THE PURCHASE, THE 57,300+ MILES ON THE PRODUCT DOES NOT REFLECT THE 'MINIMUM' MILEAGE THE TRANSMISSION IS GOOD FOR. NEEDLESS TO SAY WE PAID FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR AS WELL AS THE COST OF THE RENTAL CARS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE TRIP AND THE COST OF HOTEL ROOMS NECESSARY TO STAY OVER NIGHT AND TO MAKE A 350 MILE RETURN TRIP TO PICK UP THE VAN. THE VAN WAS NOT DRIVEN EXTENSIVELY OR DRIVEN HARSHLY DURING THE 7 YEARS I HAVE HAVE OWNED IT. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS CAR SHOULD LOSE AN ENTIRE GEAR THIS EARLY ITS LIFE ESPCIALLY IF THE PRODCUT IS SOLD AS A RELIABLE, FAMILY-SAFE VEHICLE. MY QUESTION IS WHAT FURTHER ACTIONS CAN I TAKE TO SEEK REIMBURSMENT TO DEFRAY THE REPAIR COSTS FROM THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION? PLEASE ADVISE. THANK YOU. LINDA L. KLINKSIEK",

THE SAME THING HAPPEN 3 YEARS AGO, AGAIN I WAS ON A ROAD TRIP TRAVELING 70-80 MPH IN HOT WEATHER AND THE VAN LOST POWER. UPON REACHING MY DESTINATION, I TOOK THE VAN TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, WHICH AT THAT TIME, COULD NOT PULL ANY CODES. AFTER LEAVING THE VAN FOR A WEEK, I DROVE IT BACK HOME. THE VAN STOPPED TWICE, HOME IS 400 MILES FROM MY DESTINATION. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, I TOOK THE VAN TO A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER, AND THEY PULLED A CODE THAT INDICATED A MISFIRE IN CYLINDER #5. THEY CLEARED THE CODE (DON'T KNOW WHY...), AND THEY TRIED TO DUPLICATE THE CODE. THEY COULD NOT.... THE DEALER CHARGED ME $50 AND TOLD ME THAT SINCE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ERROR CODE THE CAR SHOULD BE FINE TO DRIVE AGAIN. NOW, IT HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE YEAR 2003... VERY CONCERNED.  *NLM",

I HADE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER THAT HAD INSTALLED THE FIRST TRANSMISSION. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS OVER ITS 36,000 WARRANTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE DECLINED THE $2900 ESTIMATE AND I AM CURRENTLY GETTING A SECOND OPINION ON THE REPAIR.     MY CONCERN IS THAT WHILE I WAS RESEARCHING THE PROBLEMS OF THIS TRANSMISSION, I FOUND THAT MOST OWNERS OF THE 41TE TRANSMISSION WILL EXPERIENCE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AT AN AVERAGE OF 80,000 MILES. I FURTHER LEARNED THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS THAT THESE TRANSMISSIONS WILL FAIL, AS THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACING THEM SENSE THE 1980''S WHEN IT WAS NAMED THE A604.

I INADVERTANTLY STUMBLED ACROSS THIS OPEN NHTSA CASE WHILE LOOKING FOR A WIRING DIAGRAM TO BEGIN LOOKING INTO THE HORN PROBLEM FIRST.  WHILE THE VAN IS 6 YEARS OLD I UNDERSTAND THAT DODGE/PLYMOUTH HAVE REPLACED OVER 400,000 CLOCK SPRING ASSEMBLIES.  THE DEALERSHIP CHARGED ME $223.30 TO REPLACE THE PART INCLUDING LABOR.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THESE ASSEMBLIES HAVE FAILED WHICH I WOULD EXPECT TO LAST FOR THE LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PAY FOR THE PART IF DODGE/PLYMOUTH WOULD INSTALL IT FOR FREE.  NOT ONLY DID THEY CHARGE TO INSTALL IT, THEY WERE READY TO CHARGE ME AN ADDITIONAL $70.00 DIAGNOSTIC FEE IF THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM.  I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT DODGE/PLYMOUTH IS VERY WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY SAFETY RELATED AS I HAVE DRIVEN AROUND FOR 2 - 3 MONTHS WITH AN AIRBAG LIGHT ON WHICH I'M SURE OTHERS ARE DOING AND THEN THEY MAKE A NICE PROFIT ON CHARGING ME TO FIX A DEFECT THEY ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF.

SHE STOPPED IN A PARKING LOT AND LOOKED UNDER THE MINIVAN.  GASOLINE WAS GUSHING FROM THE GAS TANK AT A VERY HIGH RATE.  HAD THIS IGNITED, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION THAT WOULD HAVE ENVELOPED THE WHOLE VEHICLE.  MY WIFE CALLED ME AT WORK.  BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS SAFETY AND EXPLOSION HAZARD, I TOLD HER NOT TO RESTART THE CAR AND I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO OUR LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER (NAYLOR CHRYSLER IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN).  THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUND THAT THE FUEL TANK HAD COLLAPSED AND DEFORMED SEPARATING THE FUEL PUMP AND GASKET FROM THE FUEL TANK AND CREATING A LARGE GAP.  THE VEHICLE IS A WELL MAINTAINED VEHICLE WITH ONLY NORMAL HIGHWAY USAGE AND WITH NO MODIFICATIONS, NO ACCIDENTS OF ANY KIND, AND WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL FACTORY INSTALLED FUEL SYSTEM PARTS.  THE NAYLOR CHRYSLER SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE FUEL TANK AND ASSOCIATED PARTS.  THE COST WAS APPROXIMATELY $610.  I CALLED CHRYSLER CORP. AT (800) 992-1997 AND STATED THAT IF A SAFELY-RELATED DEFECT EXISTS IN A MOTOR VEHICLE, THE MANUFACTURE MUST FIX IT AT NO COST TO THE OWNER.  THE CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVE VERIFIED WITH THE DEALER THAT THE TAKN HAD COLLAPSED AND SEPARATED FROM THE FUEL PUMP AND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNMODIFIED AND ORIGINAL AND NOT IN AN ACCIDENT.  THE CHRYSLER REPORT FILED IS FILE NO. 8907052, DATED JUL 25, 2001.  CHRYSLER STATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR THIS SAFETY REPAIR BECAUSE THA VEHICLE EXCEEDED THE 3 YR., 30,000 MILE WARRANTEE AND THERE WAS NO RECALL.  I DO NOT EXPECT A FIVE YEAR OLD, WELL MAITAINED, ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT, ACCIDENT FREE VEHICLE TO HAVE A SERIOUS FUEL SYSTEM FAILURE THAT COULD EASILY CAUSE A FATAL EXPLOSION.  I REQUESTED THE DEALER TO SAVE ALL DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED PARTS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION BY CHRYSLER CORP.  CHRYLSER CORP. DECLINED TO INSPECT THE PARTS.*AK",

LAST WEEK I HEARD ON THE RADIO ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION ON THE POSSIBLE DEFECTS OF THE VEHICLES CLOCKSPRING ASSEMBLY WHICH PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE WIPERS ETC....I DID NOT CHECK TO SEE IF IT HAD AFFECTED THE HORN OR CRUISE CONTROL BECAUSE I HAD NOT USED BOTH DURING THAT TIME.  IT SEEMS THE FAULTY CLOCKSPRING POSSIBLE BLEW OUT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WHICH RESULTED IN THE NEED FOR A REPLACED BCM COMPONENT.  I AM HOPING IF THIS IS FOUND TO BE A DEFECT CHRYSLER WILL REIMBURSE THE $843.44 TO ME.*AK",

ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO, THE AIR BAG LIGHT ILLUMINATED APON START UP AND NOW STAYS ON FOR THE FULL DURATION OF THE DRIVE.   A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT, THE CRUISE CONTROL BEGAN A BIZZARE ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN  PATTERN.  EACH TIME YOU STARTED THE CAR, IT WAS A CRAP SHOOT TO SEE IF CRUISE WOULD BE WORKING.

FAILURE OF TRANSMISSION CAUSED THE TRUCK TO CATCH UP TO HER, AN ACCIDENT WAS AVOIDED WHEN SHE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. OUR 2 YEAR OLD AND 3 MONTH OLD CHILDREN WERE IN THE VEHICLE WITH HER. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF TRANSMISSION FAILURES ON THIS MODEL AND RELATED CHRYSLER PRODUCTS ON THE INTERNET. THE FAILURE OF THE FRONT DRIVE AXLE OCCURRED ON A CROWDED HIGHWAY. ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS STILL FUNCTIONING, THE NOISE REQUIRED FULL ATTENTION FROM ME TO ASSERTAIN THE SITUATION WHILE MANUEVERING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED I NOTED A CONTINUOUS PULLING TO THE LEFT. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND ALWAYS HAD THEM LOOK FOR THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM WAS VARIFIED BUT THE CAUSE WAS NEVER DETERMINED. SINCE THE NEW AXLE WAS PUT IN THE VEHICLE NO LONGER PULLS. OBVIOUSLY A BAD AXLE WAS THE CAUSE AND IT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.

NOW, YESTERDAY THEY DID YET ANOTHER FUEL SYSTEM RECALL, AND TODAY (4/15/00) THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND IT IS SPUTTERING AGAIN.  I AM SICK OF SINKING MONEY INTO THIS VAN AND IT IS NOT EVEN PAID FOR.  ALSO, THE NUMBER OF FUEL SYSTEM AND ENGINE RECALLS THEY HAVE HAD IS DANGEROUS.  MOST OF THEIR RECALLS HAVE HAD TO DO WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE VAN CATCHING FIRE.  I HATE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MY CHILDREN WHILE RIDING IN THIS VEHICLE.  THEY NEED DESPERATELY TO PUT OUT A RECALL ON THE HEAD GASKET LEAKING OIL.  I HAD TO HAVE A $1,000.00 HEAD GASKET JOB AT 60,000.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.  I THINK IT WAS DUE TO IMPROPER REPAIR OF THE OIL GALLEY PLUG RECALL, BUT THEY SAY THAT IS NOT RELATED, EVEN THOUGH IN THE RECALL NOTICE IT STATES THAT \"ENGINE CYLINDER HEAD OIL GALLEY PLUG DOES NOT SEAL PROPERLY AND ENGINE CYLINDER HEAD OIL IS NOT ADEQUATELY RETAINED.  INADEQUATE SEALING AND RETENTION OF THE PLUG CAN RESULT IN OIL LEAKAGE...\"  HOW CAN THEY SAY MY VAN LEAKING OIL FROM THE CYLINDER HEAD WAS NOT RELATED?  PLEASE RESPOND.

I CALLED CHRYSLER & THEY SAY THE FILE IS CLOSED THAT THE DM CALLED THE DEALER WHO SAYS THEY'VE HANDLED IT. STRANGE I HAVN'T HEARD THAT. THEY WANT TO \"FIX\" IT A 6TH TIME.
