I READ UP ON THE ENGINE LIGHT REGARDING P2015 CODE, WHICH IS AN INTAKE MANIFOLD PROBLEM, THAT VOLKSWAGON RECOGNIZED AS A PROBLEM, BUT INSTEAD OF RECALLING, THEY DECIDED TO EXTEND WARRANTY TO 120,000 MIKES, BUT ONLY AS A LOTTERY PICKING OF VIN NUMBERS, SO IF YOUR VIN WASN'T ON LIST, AND YOU HAD THE SAME PROBLEM,  YOU HAD TO PAY FOR THIS POOR QUALITY INTAKE MANIFOLD PROBLEM. THEY WOULD CLEAN IF ONLY CLEANING, $1200. IF IT INVOLVED THE WORSE CASE, IT TOOK CHANGING MANIFOLD, OF WHICH THAT WOULD BE, NEEDLESS TO SAY, MUCH MORE, MIND YOU AT 60,000 MILES THIS EXPENSIVE COST. SO YEAH, LOOK FORWARD TO THIS MUCH EXPENSES AT THIS EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.    SO ONE THING IS KNOWING VOLKSWAGON RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM, BUT TREATED FIX AS ONLY SOME WOULD QUALIFY FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY, AND IF YOU EXPERIENCE PROBLEM AND YOUR VIN WASN'T ON LIST YOU HAVE TO PAY.    YOU CALL VOLKSWAGON HEADQUARTERS OR CUSTOMER CARE, BECAUSE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, AND MANUFACTURER IS WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND UNDERSTAND EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, EXPLAINING YOU HAD TWO OF THEIR PRODUCTS, AND THEY MAKE THINGS GOOD AND GO THE DISTANCE, THEN THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE ALL YOU WANT IS A FIX/CORRECTIVE ACTION; HOWEVER, WHEN YOU SPEAK TO DEALERSHIP AND REPORT TO HEADQUARTERS, AND ALL THEY WANT TO QUOTE TO YOU IS THAT IT'S OUT OF THEIR HANDS, THAT YOUR CAR'S VIN # IS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON THE LIST (LOTTERY/POT LUCK), ... SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH A YOUNG CAR WITH ENORMOUS EXPENSES, AFTER THE EXPENSIVE PURCHASE WAS NOT LONG. 2014 VOLKSWAGON GTI. THE OTHER IS JUST EXTREME EXPENSE FOR CLEANING OR REPLACEMENT OF INTAKE MANIFOLD THAT COMPANY RECOGNIZES PROBLEMS, BUT HANDLES WHETHER WARRANTY IS EXTENDED OR NOT BASED ON WHETHER YOUR CAR'S VIN WAS INCLUDED, LIKE ON A LOTTERY.",

SAID ISSUE INVOLVES OCCASIONAL ZERO THROTTLE RESPONSE, WHICH HAS HAPPENED ON FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS SINCE DELIVERY. FOR YOUR REFERENCE, THIS MODEL GTI IS EQUIPPED WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.   MY COMPLAINT: OCCASIONALLY AT VERY SLOW SPEEDS (APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 20MPH) WHEN DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL (EVEN TO THE FLOOR) THE VEHICLE WILL NOT RESPOND FOR THREE FULL SECONDS, IN OTHER WORDS, THE ENGINE SPEED INDICATOR (TACHOMETER) SHOWS THE ENGINE SITTING AT IDLE SPEED FOR THE ENTIRE THREE SECONDS. THIS UNWANTED CHARACTERISTIC HAS PUT ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION MORE THAN ONCE OUT OF FOUR EPISODES I'VE EXPERIENCED THUS FAR.

I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I WONDER IF THERE'S SOME COMMON ELECTRONICS, SOFTWARE, OR OTHER ENGINE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES BEING USED IN THESE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS DESIGNS.   TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, I AM RETIRED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES DIRECTOR/SUPERVISOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN. I'VE HAD MANY YEARS EXPERIENCE  BUILDING CUSTOM SHOW WINNING AUTOMOBILES AND NASCAR CLASS ENGINES AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO ASSIST VOLKSWAGEN IN ANY WAY TO HELP GET THIS ISSUE FULLY RESOLVED.
