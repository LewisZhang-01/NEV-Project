THINKING THAT THIS WAS AN ISOLATED CASE I DID NOT PURSUE THE MATTER.  THEN RECENTLY WHEN I SURFED THE INTERNET I CAME UPON A GROUP OF GM VEHICLE OWNER WITH THE SAME TYPE OF VEHICLE AND THE SAME TYPE OF ISSUE.  SO I INVESTIGATED FURTHER.  GOING TO DIFFERENT WEB BLOGS, I FOUND MORE GM VEHICLE OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  EVERYBODY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.  THEY HAVE CRACKED DASH ON THEIR GM VEHICLES.  SOME HAVE THE CRACKS ON BOTH SIDE WHERE THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS.  THE DANGER IS THAT THIS MIGHT PUNCTURE THE AIRBAG AND RENDER IT INEFFECTIVE. THE MAIN CONCERN IS SAFETY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MY VEHICLE TO FAIL ON ME AND MY FAMILY.  IF FOR SOME REASON WATER GETS IN THE VEHICLES INSTRUMENTATION AND CAUSES AN ELECTRICAL SHORT, ME AND MY FAMILY COULD BE IN DANGER OF A VEHICLE ACCIDENT.  I AM TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE AND HAVE THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED RATHER THAN WAIT TO BE A VICTIM OF AN UNSAFE VEHICLE OR CAUSE ANOTHER DRIVER TO BE IN AN AVOIDABLE ACCIDENT.
