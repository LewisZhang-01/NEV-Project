Wire harness wires been sheared, cable protective jacket has been cut due to normal opening operation.  As a engineer with many years of experience in medical device manufacturing; this is clearly a defect related to weak construction, poor harness routing and mis-assembly.

The electrical connection was designed in such a way that normal use of the tailgate causes the wires to break, which prevents the rear backup camera from functioning. I and many drivers rely on the backup camera, along with other aids such as the rearview mirrors, to prevent collisions with pedestrians, other vehicles and other objects when backing up. The defect is clear from the photo and is well-documented by hundreds of other Honda Ridgeline owners in online posts. I believe a class action suit is being prepared or has already been filed.

This harness houses a wiring bundle including the back up camera.  I experienced a failure of the camera on August 9, 2021 when the screen was black however the guide bars were still present.  I consulted a few online resources and found that Honda is collecting information on this failure where the wire of the camera becomes sheered off and in the process breaks the wire to the camera rendering it blank.  I contacted a Honda dealership to get a new harness and and had the repair made on August 31, 2021 only to find that Honda only authorized the same defective part number as the replacement.  The 2020 and later models have a different part number with no reported issues, but because my vehicle is a 2018, they installed the same defective harness.  The design of the tailgate has not changed since 2017.   The back up camera is a vital safety component on my vehicle.  I am at a complete loss as to why Honda would replace a faulty part with the same faulty part, other than as a way of charging $360 to get another repair.",

The camera not working reduces my ability to see behind me for any potential collision issues when I\u2019m backing up. I have searched for similar issues that other Honda Ridgeline owners might have reported, and I have found several reports, and also posted video\u2019s on how to fix this issue with replacing the wiring harness (and the wires in the harness). On my Ridgeline, this failure happened about 4 or 5 months after the warranty of 3 years ran out. Other reports that I\u2019ve viewed in various forums report similar timeframes, and yet some reported this issue occurring while it was still under warranty. I am currently in contact with Honda to see if they will assist in the cost for this repair, but that is still being discussed. There was no warning that this issue was about to occur. It simply quit working one day (late April of 2021). I hope you\u2019re able to investigate and see that this might well be a pattern failure with the wiring on these vehicles and perhaps  take action to help eliminate any backup safety issues that this might create.",
