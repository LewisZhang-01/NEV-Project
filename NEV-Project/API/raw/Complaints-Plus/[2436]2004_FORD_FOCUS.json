SO I CALLED THE CLOSEST FORD DEALERSHIP 29 MILES AWAY AND TRIED TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION WITH THEM.  I CALLED ANOTHER FORD DEALER AND WAS QUOTED 3 TIMES AS MUCH.  I CALLED THE FORD  CUSTOMER SERVICE TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AND GOT THE SAME BLASE ATTITUDE ABOUT THE SITUATION.  NO ONE THOUGHT IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT OWNERS NEEDED TO BE NOTIFIED.  BUT 4 TIMES IN TOTAL, MY LIFE AND MY FIANCE'S LIFE WERE IN DANGER.  THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE OF FORD'S NEGLIGENCE.  REMEMBER THE FIRESTONE TIRES???  *TR",

HE HAD THE SUGGESTION TO LOOK ON THE INTERNET - TO LOOK UP FORD FOCUS AND KEY WON'T TURN ON GOOGLE.  I DID JUST THAT - AND THERE WERE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THIS HAPPENING TO PEOPLE THAT HAD FORD FOCUS'S.  A SUGGESTION ON THERE - WAS TO GET A SMALL HAMMER OR THE END OF A SCREW DRIVER AND WHILE YOU PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION - PUSH IT REAL HARD AND HIT THE KEY WITH A HAMMER.  IT WORKED!  MY KEY MOVED TO THE START POSITION AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR HOME.  THE WEBSITE THAT TOLD US TO TRY THAT SAID - IT WOULD WORK TO GET THE CAR TO WHERE YOU WANTED IT TO GO - BUT THAT YOU WOULD NEED A NEW PART FOR THE IGNITION AND IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WOULD COST QUITE A LOT.  I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THIS - SO I JUST LEAVE MY KEY IN THE IGNITION AT ALL TIMES - AND USE MY SPARE KEY TO UNLOCK THE CAR.  I FEEL THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FOR THIS - AS MANY, MANY PEOPLE ONLINE HAVE COMPLAINED - IT SAID FORD FOCUS FROM YEARS 200-2004 (MINE IS A 2004).  A PERSON CAN BECOME STRANDED AS THIS CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ANYWHERE THEY PARK THEIR CAR.  THIS WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY - HOWEVER, MY WARRANTY HAS LONG PASSED.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS - SINCE EVERYONE IS HAVING PROBLEMS - I BELIEVE IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP ON THIS MATTER.  TRICIA WALTER",

YET, WHEN I LOOKED UP MY HISTORY IT SAYS THAT ALL THAT WAS REPLACED WAS A CONNECTOR ON THE COIL, NOT THE COIL ITSELF.  SO, THE COIL WAS NEVER ACTUALLY REPLACED, BUT I WAS ALMOST BEING BLAMED FOR DESTROYING MY COIL.  I AM STILL FIGHTING TO GET MY VEHICLE FIXED UNDER WARRANTY AND BEING TREATED VERY POORLY.
