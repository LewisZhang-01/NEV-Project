Additionally, the volume control button did not work.   I headed to the nearest GM dealer, and I did not attempt to turn off the screen. A service representative said I needed an appointment, and I could not be seen until one day during the next week.  I needed the turn-by-turn navigation, and I did not know if the issue would worsen or cause other issues, so I asked for a rental vehicle. My vehicle had accumulated less than 10,000 miles, and I have an extended warranty.  I was told the vehicle has to be diagnosed before a rental is approved, and their loaner vehicles were out for two and a half weeks.   Every dealership I called stated I could not get an appointment that day. I asked GM to call dealers, and nothing worked. GM said if I rented a vehicle, they would not reimburse me because my vehicle would need to be diagnosed beforehand, with a minimum of a one-day, overnight stay.   Normally, the back-up camera takes too long to transition to the radio screen, and it has temporarily appeared black.  At less than 300 miles, the vehicle stopped going into drive. That occurred three times, placing me into a dangerous situation the third time, before the selling dealer decided to replace the transmission. At less than 8,000 miles, the driver door switch had to be replaced. I purchased the vehicle with seven accumulated miles.  I am still getting familiar with this state, so I need navigation, but it would have caused major safety issues had I attempted to visit family members out-of-state, like I had planned, without turn-by-turn navigation.  I had to forgo visiting my family. If more pressing issues had arisen, I would have been completely stranded, over a long weekend, and possibly on a roadside, like before.
