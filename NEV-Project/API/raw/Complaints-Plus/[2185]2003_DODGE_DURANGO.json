HE SAID HE SEES THEM SHORT OUT \"ALL THE TIME, SOME OF THEM SO BAD THEY ACTUALLY CATCH FIRE!\"  (DIRECT QUOTE FROM HIM.)

MANY OWNERS EXPERIENCE A \"ROCKING BACK AND FORTH\" OF THE SEATS WHEN ACCELERATING AND STOPPING.  MY VEHICLE HAS THIS PROBLEM.  IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A \"WASHER\" THAT KEEPS THE ROD THAT CONNECTS TO THE POWER SEAT MOTOR UNIT UNDER THE SEAT.  THERE IS A HEX SHAPED WASHER THAT HOLDS THE ROD IN PLACE. THIS HEX SHAPED WASHER SNAPS AND BREAKS OFF. THE RESULT IS A WHIP-LASH TYPE JERK WHEN COMING TO AN ABRUPT STOP.  THE DEALERSHIPS ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS IT IS COMMON AND SUGGEST THAT THE COST OF REPAIR CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM $500 TO $700 FOR PART AND LABOR.  THE FIX SUGGESTED BY DEALERSHIPS IS TO REPLACE THE MOTOR, THOUGH IT IS THE HEX NUT HOLDING THE ROD FROM THE MOTOR THAT IS THE CULPRIT.  THE FIX SIMPLY REQUIRES A NEW HEX WASHER WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE SEAT BRACKET ALONG WITH NEW BOLTS.

THE VEHICLE CROSSED THE ONCOMING LANE OF A TWO-LANE MINOR HIGHWAY (RTE 187) AND WENT INTO THE FRONT YARD OF A HOME AND HIT A TREE. SPEED LIMIT IS 35. THE FRONT PASSENGER NOSE OF THE DURANGO IMPACTED WITH THE TREE. THE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE WAS DEEMED TOTALED BY THE OTHER DRIVER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM). THE ITEM WE WISH TO DRAW TO YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR INVOLVED THE SUSPENSION ROD, WHICH CAME OFF AND UP THROUGH THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT OF THE CARAND THROUGH THE ROOF. HAD ANYONE BEEN SITTING THERE THEY WOULD HAVE MOST CERTAINLY BEEN SKEWERED. THANKFULLY, I HAD JUST DROPPED MY CHILDREN OFF . MY 16 YEAR OLD NORMALLY SITS UP FRONT. ONE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE FRONT TIRE CAME OFF THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY AS WELL. THE SHOULDER PART OF THE SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK AND MY UPPER BODY WAS ALLOWED TO BANG AROUND. I SPENT 4 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND WAS OUT OF WORK FOR 5 WEEKS. I AM STILL ONLY ON LIGHT DUTY DUE TO THE CONDITION OF MY KNEE AND THE POST CONCUSSION SYNDROME I AM HAVING.

I ALSO CALLED THE DEALER PARTS PERSON TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD REPLACEMENTS AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAS BEEN HAVING A RUN ON THEM AND THAT EITHER SOMEBODY MUST BE COLLECTING THEM OR THEY WERE DEFECTIVE.

THE DAY BEFORE I WAS TO TAKE IT TO HIM THE CBS NEWS SHOWED A STORY ON DODGE DURANGO'S AND THE UPPER BALL JOINTS. I ASKED OUR MECHANIC TO CHECK THESE ALSO. HE FOUND THE LEFT SIDE WORN AND THE RIGHT SIDE WAS TO THE POINT THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.

I TRIED TO START IT SAT, SUN AND MON.  IT MADE A NOICE BUT WOULD NOT START.   I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPT EARLY MON MORNING. THEY ALSO COULD NOT START IT.  MULTIPLE TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS CAR FOR THE LAST 5 DAYS AND THE DEALER WAS FINALLY ABLE TO START IT BUT THEY CAN NOT DIAGNOIS OR FIX THE PROBLEM AS THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS WRONG.  THE CAR WOULD NOT START FOR THE DEALER 3 TIMES WHILE IN THEIR POSSESSION. TODAY, FRIDAY, AUG 22, THE DEALER HAD THE CAR RUNNING AND WANTED TO RELEASE IT BACK TO ME WITH NO REPAIRS.  I REFUSED TO TAKE IT BACK AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND AM AFRAID THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEPEND ON IT STARTING EVERYDAY AS THEY DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T START FOR ALL THE OTHER DAYS.  THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR TO SEE IF IT STARTS ON MON, AUG 25TH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CATEGORY THIS FALLS INTO BUT TO ME IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMPUTERS IN THE CAR ARE READING THAT THE CAR IS OUT OF GAS AND MAYBE IT WILL HAPPEN ON THE EXPRESSWAY AND I WILL HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  I MAY BE IN AN UNSAFE AREA OR OUT AT NIGHT ALONE AND THIS CAR WILL NOT START.  I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE OUT OF STATE BECAUSE I'LL BE AFRAID THAT I'LL BE STRANDED.  I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT I WOULD PURCHASE A CAR AT THIS PRICE AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONFIDENCE IN IT OR HAVE THE ABILTY TO GO WHERE I CHOOSE AND WHEN I CHOOSE. ALL I WANTED WAS TO GET THE CAR FIXED BUT NO ONE CAN DETERMINE WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED OR HOW TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.  *AK",

THE ROTORS HAVE BEEN REPLACE TWICE, THE REAR END TWICE AND NOW THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS INTO NEUTRAL WHILE DRIVING.  THIS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.  I OWNED A 1999 DURANGO AND HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH IT.  THE STEERING COLUMN HAD TO BE REPLACED A FEW TIMES AND THE BALL JOINTS.  THE TRANSMISSION ALSO HAD DONE THE SAME THING.  DODGE COULD NEVER FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT DURANGO AND CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS TRANSMISSION.  THE LAST DURANGO THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPED INTO NEUTRAL WHILE CROSSING OVER LANES WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC COMING RIGHT AT ME.  AGAIN, THE DEALER COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  SAME WITH THIS ONE.  I AM REQUESTING THAT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER AND WILLIAMSBURG DODGE REFUND MY MONEY AND TAKE THE TRUCK BACK.  THEY RECENTLY HAD MY DURANGO FOR 15 DAYS.  THE FIRST 10 DAYS THE DISTRICT MANAGER, JAMES BROWN, AND SHANE LOCKHART, DEALERS TECH MANAGER, ARGUED THAT MY CAMPER WEIGHED TOO MUCH.  I GAVE THEM EVIDENCE THAT MY CAMPER ONLY WEIGHED 4295 LBS.  DAIMLER-CHRYSLER SELLS THE DURANGO BOASTING IT CAN TOW 7400 LBS.  AFTER I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH DAIMLER-CHRYSLER, JAMES BROWN SAID HE MADE A MISTAKE ON THE WEIGHT.  NOW, THEY WANT TO INSPECT MY CAMPER FOR FAULTY BREAKS.  THEY ARE SAYING SOMEHOW IT IS CAUSING STRESS ON THE DURANGO.  GIVE ME A BREAK!!!  I HAVE HAD MY CAMPER INSPECTED.  SURPRISINGLY, THE PLACE WHERE I HAVE GONE SAYS THEY GET THIS A LOT FROM DODGE OWNERS.  DO WE SEE A PATTERN?  THEY ALSO GET A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR DODGE OWNERS TO HAVE TRANSMISSION COOLANTS PUT ON THEIR DODGES.  WHAT DOES THIS TELL US?  CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM TELLS A LOT ABOUT DODGE.
