I HAD THE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE BY BMW HIGHLY TRAINED TECHNICIANS SINCE YEAR 2000. THE CAR WAS SERVICE AT BMW IN 2007 FOR THE HEATING & AIR CONDITION COMPRESSOR (HVAC) AND BMW WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT.  WE INFORMED BMW ON MANY SERVICE VISITS PRIOR TO THE 2007 SERVICE VISIT AND AFTER 2007 THAT THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT CONSTANTLY COMES ON WHEN EITHER CONDUCTING NORMAL DRIVING ON APPROVED ROADS OR ON ONE OCCASION WHEN THE DRIVERS DOOR WAS SHUT AFTER ARRIVING HOME FROM A SERVICE VISIT. ON ONE VISIT THEY RESET THE LIGHT WITHOUT CHARGE AND ON OTHER SERVICE VISIT THEY WANTED TO CHARGE A FEE FOR RESETTING THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT. HOWEVER, ON ONE SERVICE VISIT BMW SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I NEVER RECEIVE ANY NOTICES FROM BMW INFORMING ME THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM. I ASSUMED THAT TAKING THE VEHICLE FOR SERVICE THAT ALL PROBLEMS WAS IDENTIFIED BY BMW ALLOWING THE CUSTOMERS TO DETERMINE THE REPAIR DECISION.   ON OR ABOUT 03 AUG 08, THE HEAD AIRBAG DEPLOYED WHILE CONDUCTING NORMAL DRIVING ON AN APPROVED HARD BALL ROAD. AFTER TAKING THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE AND INFORMING BMW ABOUT THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT, THEY REPLIED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. AS A RESULT THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT WAS ON PRIOR TO THE DEPLOYMENT. THE CAR HAS BEEN DISABLED FOR 4 MONTHS PENDING A DECISION ON REPAIR COST OF $9000.",

I TOOK IT INTO THE LOCAL BMW DEALERSHIP AND IT TOOK ABOUT 3 DIAGNOSTIC VISITS TO DETERMINE THAT I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION FOR $6K.  MY CAR HAD LESS THAN 80,000 MILES ON IT.  I THEN TOOK IT TO SEVERAL BMW SPECIALIST AUTO SHOPS WHO EXPLAINED TO ME IN FULL DETAIL THE ISSUE THAT THIS GM TRANSMISSION IS KNOWN TO HAVE.  APPARENTLY THE TRANSMISSION FAILS IN 5TH GEAR AND DEFAULTS TO 4TH GEAR, WHICH NOT ONLY CAUSES IT TO DRIVE DIFFERENTLY, BUT CAN CAUSE OTHER EXPENSIVE ISSUES.  AFTER READING SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TRANSMISSION, I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT BMW HAS LET THIS GO AND HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  I AM DISAPPOINTED W/ THE POOR QUALITY OF THE AMERICAN MADE TRANSMISSION, AND WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BMW AGAIN.  *TR",
