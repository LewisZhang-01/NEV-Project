This has been a reoccurring issue since early 2017 and is still a problem, even after replacement of the previous battery. I've had the replacement battery tested on several occasions after recharging and the result has always been that the battery is in good operating order. Subsequent alternator tests show the alternator is charging within manufacturer specifications. I've performed multiple tests after fully recharging the batter on several occasions, making sure all electrical accessories have remained (off) for extended periods of time, and the battery continues to discharge. The electrical system has been tested with a professional scan tool, on multiple occasions, and has yielded no adverse results. There has never been any vehicle warning indicators activate to indicate a problem. Today (2/25/2022) I had to have my Outback jump started 3 times in route to my home 65 miles away. The car died on the road shortly after the first jump, and again after turning the car off to refuel. I looked online to see if anyone else has had similar issues and found the battery discharge/non-start issue to be widespread....and Subaru seems to have been aware of the issue as early as 2017 according to a TSB Subaru sent to all dealers alerting of a potential electrical problem, but providing no solution. This is a SAFETY ISSUE. If access to an operable car were ever needed in an emergency situation (or) a vehicle lost power while in operation causing an accident resulting in injury or death due to a documented issue Subaru was aware of, but neglected to address, would be tragic. Not only for owners of the affected automobiles, but also any other parties involved. This issue should be immediately investigated & addressed by the NHTSA. thank you.",

They recommended a complete replacement of the exhaust manifold \"under Subaru recall\".  They printed the recall for me. It is WUJ-95. Which recalls 2015-2016 outbacks for this issue.  When I contacted the dealer they indicated my vehicle was not under this recall.  Subaru Customer care indicated the same as did your website.  Subaru said that the recall was initiated by NHTSA and that until NHTSA indicated my vehicle was included in the recall they would not repair it.  My vehicle has exactly the same issue as what was found for the recall. The only thing I can assume is that my actual 2016 Subaru outback was manufactured after 9/30/15.

However, that actual manufacture date should not be controlling as my 2016 outback has exactly the same issue as the recall.

I took the car to dealer on 1/16/2019 (mileage 25,941).They  tried to tell me that the battery was leaking, but it was not. They replaced the battery and I had to pay the cost for a new battery, $123.97. On 1/27/2021 (mileage 39,172) the new battery failed in a similar manner. The dealership insisted that there were no problems with the charging system. They replaced the battery ( no cost) and performed an ECM update. They were insistent that there were no systemic issues with the electrical system. After the fact, I discovered that this is a universal problem with a number of Subaru vehicles. During a recent visit to my Subaru dealership I inquired as to whether a solution has been determined and will my car be fixed before the new battery also fails. They were very vague and non-informing. I am hesitant to venture far from home with this vehicle since I cannot trust the car or Subaru's support. I can provide dealer service records in support of this issue.",

In addition to the battery replacement there was an ECM update done this last time to reduce battery drain. There is no warning or indication that a failure is about to occur.  This last time I moved the car from my garage to my driveway and 4 hours later, the car would not start and the battery measured 4.25 volts--no lights were left on, doors open, seat heaters on etc.   The concern is that it is impossible to tell if the car has drained the battery and it can leave us stranded anywhere we have turned it off.  I contacted Subaru of America this last time and they said not even to \"jump\" it as it would possible loose valuable error codes.   I have their roadside assistance and even though I received a call confirming that a flatbed would arrive within 60 mins. it never showed.

I was in the next to left lane in 4 lanes of traffic.  The moonroof on my 2016 Subaru Outback exploded violently sending glass outward into traffic.  I had never heard of this phenomena so when I saw black material from the top of my car going into traffic I thought it was pieces of my roof rack.   I pulled over to the shoulder to examine my car and saw a massive hole in the moonroof.  Knowing that if I continued shards of glass would continue to be expelled onto the interstate I pulled the remaining pieces of glass into the interior of the car.  Not that it mattered, that's where they fell anyway when I opened the moonroof.  The pieces of the moonroof fell into the slots for the seatbelts, rendering the drivers side inoperable. It was a miracle that no other car was seriously impacted and that I was able to get home safely.  Subaru and any other car manufacturer that is involved with this problem needs to be held accountable for the damages and remedial repairs.  This problem should be addressed by the NHTSA immediately.",

In addition, at the time of this 2nd battery replacement, the vehicle was inspected by our dealership to assess why the battery died, and though no direct cause was found, the battery cables were replaced. This July 11th, 2021, the battery was dead once again, and replaced under warranty, again thinking it was a defective battery. Yesterday, July 25th, two weeks after this 3rd new battery replacement, the battery was dead again. No user error was ever noted (no internal light left on, vehicle had been driven regularly every day of the week, etc.).

The only fix is to repeatedly shift in and out of the park position until the key releases (which can take anywhere from 1 minute to 10 minutes -- it seems to get worse over time).  It's a safety concern for various reasons:  you can't exit your car quickly in case of emergency -- you can't just leave your vehicle with the keys in the ignition (dangerous/negligent/someone could steal your car).  It's also concerning that the car doesn't recognize what gear it is in.  This is a widespread issue across Subaru vehicles that is documented in many online forums.  The issue was confirmed by the dealership that I went to on my vehicle specifically, but they also knew the source of the problem, before they even looked at the vehicle.",

I called the dealer and they said it might help to install a higher CCA rated battery.I replaced the original battery in 2018 with a higher rated Interstate CCA battery. That battery was also over time  not being charged sufficiently and I took it back to the Firestone dealer who installed another  Interstate Brand battery replacing it in 2020 under warranty.  I called the dealership again and they said there was no reported issues with Subaru Outbacks insufficiently charging and that I just had to drive the car more frequently. So far the car has failed to start on 5 occasions, stranding either myself or my wife, twice in unsafe situations. I now routinely have to charge the battery in my garage about once a month to keep it operational, even after driving the car frequently. On 5/3/2021 I took the car back to the dealer for some service work. I asked again if there was any fix for the charging issue.

IT ORIGINATES AT THE BASE OF THE WINDSHIELD, PASSES OVER THE 6 RED DEFROSTER WIRES BELOW THE WINDSHIELD, AND EXTENDS ~10\" UP ON THE DRIVERS SIDE TOWARD THE REAR VIEW MIRROR.  THERE ARE NO PITS ETC., THIS CRACK ORIGINATED ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  THIS CRACK PERFECTLY MATCHES THE CRACK PATTERN AND DESCRIPTION IDENTIFIED IN SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN 12-192-15R, REVISED 11/19/15.  THAT BULLETIN WAS ISSUED AS A RESULT OF SUBARU'S LOOSING A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA REGARDING BROKEN GLASS WINDSHIELDS BECAUSE OF MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  UNFORTUNATELY SUBARU IS ONLY REPLACING DEFECTIVE GLASS ON OUTBACKS UP TO VIN G3222455/G3210476.  OUR MANUFACTURING VIN IS EARLY 2016, AND THE JUDGE IN THE CASE DID NOT EXTEND JUDGMENT AGAINST SUBARY TO COVER OUR OUTBACK.  THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM WITH OUR OUTBACK AS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CASE.  HERE IN NEW JERSEY WE HAVE BEEN HAVING SEVERAL WEEKS OF HARSH WEATHER, OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE ~20 DEGREES F IN THE MORNING.  THE OUTBACK IS GARAGED, IT IS A WARM GARAGE.    EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A 2016, WE ASSUME THE EXTREME IS A FACTOR.  THIS IS NOT A STONE HIT PROBLEM, ALL THE DRIVING IS NORTHERN NJ SURBURBAN ROADS, NOT HIGHWAY DRIVING.  WE SEE MANY MANY COMPLAINTS DEFINITELY A MANUFACTURING ISSUE.  ATTACHING A PHOTO OF CRACK. I RUN MY FINGER OVER THE CRACK AND ACTUALLY CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING, NO DINGS, NOTHING.",

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 A SMALL VISIBLE RUNNING CRACK ONE INCH IN LENGTH APPEARED JUST IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT WINDSHIELD.

ONE RUNNING CRACK HAS NOW SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE LOWER HALF OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD TOWARDS THE PASSENGER SIDE. ANOTHER VISIBLE RUNNING CRACK ONE INCH IN LENGTH NOW HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF FRONT WINDSHIELD. IT TOO ORIGINATES FROM THE LOWER PORTION OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IN THE DEICER/DEFROSTER AREA. UNDER VERY CLOSE PHOTO INSPECTION AT THE JUNCTIONS OF THESE MERGING CRACKS CHIPPING IS OCCURRING CAUSING ADDITIONAL SPIDERING CRACKS. I DID CONTACT MY SUBARU DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON MARCH 5, 2019.A SALESPERSON  FILLED OUT AND I SIGNED AN INFORMATION FORM FOR REPORTING THIS ISSUE TO SUBARU AMERICA.

THIS HAPPENED AT 25,000 KM ON THE ODOMETER IN SEPTEMBER OF 2017. IT IS NOW JANUARY 15, 2018 AND I AM IN FLORIDA. THE CAR HAS 33,000 KM. ON IT THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED, WITH A SLOW TO TURN OVER FOR ABOUT 1 WEEK AND THEN FAILURE TO START. I TESTED THE BATTERY WITH A LOAD TESTER AND IT TESTED AS \"BAD\" ON THE GUAGE. WE THEN BOOSTED IT TO START AND TESTED THE VOLTAGE FROM THE ALTERNATOR WHICH WAS 14 VOLTS AND THE BATTERY TESTED 12 VOLTS. AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF RUN TIME WE TURNED IT OFF AND IT FAILED TO START AGAIN. AFTER BOOSTING AGAIN I DROVE IT LESS THAN 1 MILE TO MY HOUSE AND LET IT RUN WHILE I CALLED THE ROADSIDE ASSIST AND GOT THE PHONE NUMBER OF THE NEAREST SUBARU DEALER, WHO INFORMED ME THAT ROADSIDE ASSIST WOULD BRING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WOULD TEST IT. IF THE BATTERY WAS BAD THEN THEY WOULD REPLACE IT. AFTER 15 MINUTES I RETURNED TO MY CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY  AND TURNED IT OFF. I THEN ATTEMPTED TO START IT SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY TIME IT STARTED CORRECTLY. MY WIFE THEN DROVE IT 15 KM. TO GET GROCERIES AND IT RESTARTED EVERY TIME THAT SHE LEFT THE STORES. I THEN DID ANOTHER LOAD TEST ON THE BATTERY AND THE NEEDLE NEVER WAVERED FROM THE GREEN AREA OF THE GUAGE. IT LEAVES YOU WONDERING WHEN YOU WILL BE STRANDED IN THE WILDERNESS OR THE SIDE OF AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP THAT YOU MAY OFFER.",

THE EXACT SAME UNSAFE CONDITION HAS HAPPENED TWICE; FIRST IN OCTOBER 2016 AT APPROXIMATELY  8800 MILES, AND SECOND IN DECEMBER 2017 AT APPROXIMATELY 24,000 MILES.    DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:  WHILE SLOWLY PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE AND GENTLY APPLYING THE BRAKE, THE CAR'S ENGINE RPM ACCELERATED AND I HAD TO BREAK HARD IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR.  I MOVED THE TRANSMISSION TO PARK, BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED AT HIGH RPM SO I MOVED THE TRANSMISSION TO REVERSE, THEN TO NEUTRAL, THEN I TURNED OFF THE CAR OFF SINCE THE ENGINE WAS STILL AT A HIGH RPM.  A NOTICE APPEARED IN MY ODOMETER AREA TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, WHICH I DID.  I THEN RESTARTED IT AND EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL AGAIN.    NOTE: I DID NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY PUSH THE BREAK AND THE ACCELERATOR TOGETHER WHICH COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE THIS SITUATION.  I AM FORTUNATE NOTHING WAS IN FRONT OF ME EITHER TIME.  I HOPE NO ONE HAS BEEN INJURED, BUT IT IS LIKELY PROPERTY DAMAGE HAS RESULTED.    PLEASE DETERMINE THE CAUSE AND CORRECT THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION.  I AM TAKING MY CAR FOR A 24,000 MILE SERVICE ON 1/3/2017 AND WILL DOCUMENT THIS WITH THE DEALER (MASTRO SUBARU) AT THAT TIME.

ISSUE:  IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A DRIVER TO INADVERTENTLY TURN OFF THE ENGINE (WE ARE ONLY HUMAN) USING THE START/STOP BUTTON WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE, PARK OR NEUTRAL.  IF VEHICLE IS ON A SLOPE, THE VEHICLE WILL ROLL FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS ON IT'S OWN. THIS PRESENTS A SERIOUS RISK OF GRAVE BODILY HARM TO PEOPLE IN THE PATH OF THE UNATTENDED MOVING VEHICLE.    THIS ALREADY HAPPENED WITH MY VEHICLE, LUCKILY IT HAPPENED INSIDE MY GARAGE ON A VERY SLIGHT SLOPE AND MY CLOSED GARAGE DOOR STOPPED THE VEHICLE. IF MY CHILDREN HAD BEEN BEHIND THE VEHICLE, REMOVING THEIR SCHOOL BAGS, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PINNED TO THE GARAGE DOOR BY A 3500 LB VEHICLE. UNACCEPTABLE.    I REPAIRED THE SLIGHT DAMAGE BODY WORK ON THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER BUT THAT IS IRRELEVANT COMPARED TO THE SAFETY RISK PRESENTED BY THIS \"WORKS AS DESIGNED\" BEHAVIOR OF THE CAR.    POSSIBLE WORKAROUND:   1. SUBARU NEEDS TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR AND ELIMINATE THE RISK BY AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGING THE ELECTRIC \"PARK BRAKE\" THAT IS ALREADY INSTALLED IN THIS MODEL VEHICLE, WHEN THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF.  2.  DISABLE ENGINE STOP UNTIL TRANSMISSION IS SET TO PARK.    THE CURRENT AUDIBLE WARNING IS INSUFFICIENT.    MY 15 YEAR OLD VEHICLE DID NOT ALLOW THE KEY TO BE REMOVED FROM THE IGNITION SLOT UNTIL PARK LEVER WAS ENGAGED TO PREVENT THIS EXACT PROBLEM.  *TR",

MY WIFE WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS RIDING IN THE BACK SEAT.  AS THE BRAKES FAILED, I CONTINUED ATTEMPTING TO SLOW THE CAR. ULTIMATELY, WE WERE INVOLVED IN A TWO-CAR COLLISION IN WHICH THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL-WELL OF MY CAR WAS CRUSHED.      MY WIFE, MY MOTHER-IN LAW, AND I SUFFERED SEVERE INJURIES. MY WIFE SUFFERED FRACTURED RIBS, A FRACTURED STERNUM, A FRACTURED PELVIS, AND HER ANKLE WAS CRUSHED. MY MOTHER-IN LAW SUFFERED FRACTURED RIBS AND A CONCUSSION. I SUFFERED FRACTURED RIBS, AND THE TRAUMA HAS LED TO A FLAIR UP OF MY PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS.      FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, WE WERE RUSHED BY EMS TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE WE RECEIVED TREATMENT FOR OUR INJURIES.  WHILE MY MOTHER-IN LAW AND I WERE RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL NEXT DAY, MY WIFE CONTINUES TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AT THE HOSPITAL. SHE HAD ON HER ANKLE EXTENSIVE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY THAT REQUIRED THREE METAL PLATES TO HOLD HER BONES TOGETHER WHILE THEY HEAL. SHE WILL SOON BEGIN REHABILITATION, LEARNING TO WALK AGAIN.  MY WIFE'S RECOVERY IS EXPECTED TO TAKE MANY MONTHS.    SHORTLY AFTER BUYING THE CAR, IT WAS RECALLED DUE TO ISSUES WITH THE CAR'S STEERING COLUMN. RECENTLY, MANY MORE OF THE SAME CAR HAVE BEEN RECALLED DUE TO ISSUES WITH THE CAR'S BRAKE CALIPERS. I BELIEVE MY CAR MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE BRAKE ISSUES TOO. I WOULD APPRECIATE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE BRAKES OF 2016 SUBARU OUTBACKS.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

THE PEBBLE STRIKES OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS ON HIGHWAY OFF RAMPS. THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE DURING THE PEBBLE STRIKES, WHICH TOOK PLACE OVER SEVERAL DAYS OF DRIVING, RANGED FROM 60 TO 85 DEGREES F.
