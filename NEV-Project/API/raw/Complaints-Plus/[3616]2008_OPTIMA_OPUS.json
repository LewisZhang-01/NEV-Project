THIS CAR WAS BRANDNEW WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND THIS IS NOT MY FIRST CAR NEW THAT I PURCHASED SINCE I HAVE BEEN DRIVING! I NORMALLY BUY EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS A NEW CAR AND NEVER HAD MORE PROBLEMS THEN I HAD HAVE WITH THIS ONE AND WONDERED IF ANYONE ELSE HAD SAME ISSUES I AM HAVING WITH IN THIS SHORT TIME FROM REPLACING ONE PART AFTER ANOTHER? TODAY WHICH IS JANUARY 8TH 2015 I WAS COMING HOME AND  WHEN I CAME TO A STOP SIGN I HAD NO BREAKS AND AFTER PUTTING EMERGENCY BREAK ON (WHICH BROKE) THE LIGHT CAME ON WHICH SAID BREAKS!! I HAVE NEVER FELT SO UNSAFE IN A CAR THEN I DO WITH THIS ONE. LAST SUMMER OUT FOR A DRIVE MY BACK DRIVER SIDE TIRE AREA WAS SMOKING SO I PULLED OVER AND THOUGHT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE! ONCE AGAIN HAD IT TOWED! IT WAS THE BREAK HOSE SO THEY THOUGHT AND REPLACED IT AND FOUND IT WAS THE CALIBER, I JUST SPENT 3HRS WAITING AT SHOP TO HAVE THAT FIXED AND COME TO THINK OF IT, I'VE SPENT ALOT MORE TIME AT SHOP ON THE OTHER FIXED PARTS, I KNOW CARS NEED THINGS REPLACED FROM WEAR&TEAR BUT GIVE ME A BREAK AND IM NOT LAUGHING ABOUT THIS EITHER! NOW IM OUT OF MY CAR AGAIN AND ASKING FOR RIDES TO WORK AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE NO BRAKELINES. THANKS SO VERY MUCH FOR MAYBE READING THIS! [XXX]   P.S. PLEASE SEND THROUGH MAIL ANY RECALLS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER GOT ANY! THANK YOU    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
