I believe it is a safety issue because it reduces the trucks ability to stop quickly, it may cause my truck to swerve in an emergency stop situation, and if this happens while the cruise control is on it turns the cruise control off unexpectedly.  This happened to me in a bad rainstorm and caused my truck to swerve into the next lane over.  I asked the dealer when they could get to repairing it and thy told me it would be months before they could repair it and it would cost approximately 1,800 dollars.

        "summary": "My issue seems to be a highly reported issue that the manufacture refuses to address. The ABS pump/control/module fails on this model Ram at an alarmingly high rate, causing loss of brakes, or locking up of brakes.  I bought this truck just over 3 years ago and the first time it happened was about a year after I bought it with around 26,000 miles on the truck. I took it back to the dealer and they diagnosed it as a bad ABS control module/pump and replaced it under warranty. Since it was a safety issue the dealership even provided me with a free rental vehicle while the truck was being repaired.  When the ABS pump/control module goes out the service Electronic brake system message comes up (see picture below)  Fast forward about year and a half later and another 25k miles (the truck just hit 50k miles) and the same issue has happened again. The new ABS pump/control module has failed again with only 25k miles since the repair. And this time the truck is no longer in warranty so the dealership will expect me to foot the bill for something they know is a defective part from the factory.  Here is the link to google search, if you read the complaints you will see there are thousands of people having the same issue. And many stories of accidents or near accidents because of the brakes failing.  https://www.google.com/search?q=2018+ram+2500+abs+issues  This is a serious safety issue that needs to be addressed immediately. If the factory part remains defective, then they need to develop a replacement part that won't FAIL every year or two.  My truck just turned 4 years old and has 50k miles on it, which is right at the national average. The truck isn't over used or abused so there is no reason for the ABS to be failing not only on my truck but so many others.  Please advise me of how we can remedy this asap. I'll include my contact info below. I can scan the papers from the first warranty repair for the ABS if needed.

Used a bi-directional scan tool to verify the fault as a ABS motor connection fault. Purchased the OEM hydraulic control unit installed and corrected the problem. After replacement the bad unit dc motor was found to be open no electrical connection. I have also performed a simple failure analysis. I found that one of the two DC motor brushes to be stuck in the brush holder. this appears to be causing intermittent connection faults on the rough road and total failure in the near future. I have found that the other brush that was making contact with the motor armature could be pushed into the brush holder and would also stick for a short time. This looks to be a design and or tolerance issue. I cut the outer motor housing with a small metal cutting wheel, while removing the armature probably pushed the bad brush into it's deeper position with no contact.

AT TIME OF PURCHASE IT HAD 555 MILES ON IT, AND WE'D ONLY DRIVEN IT 3 TIME PRIOR TO THIS. WE WERE DRIVING BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT. THE TRUCK STARTING LOOSING POWER, WE SAW A LITTLE SMOKE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR. AS WE SLOWED THE SMOKE INCREASED. UPON LIFTING THE HOOD, TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS SQUATTING OUT ACROSS THE ENGINE PORING ON THE GROUND, FLAMES WERE MOVING ALONG THE BACK OF THE FIRE WALL. WE PUT THE FIRE OUT OURSELVES PRIOR TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVING. OUR INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR SAID IT WAS A WARRANTY ISSUES, DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION LINE. HE ALSO SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT WE COULD HAVE OR MIGHT HAVE DONE. CHRYSLER'S INVESTIGATIONS REVEALED THAT IT WAS ALSO A WARRANTY ISSUE.",
