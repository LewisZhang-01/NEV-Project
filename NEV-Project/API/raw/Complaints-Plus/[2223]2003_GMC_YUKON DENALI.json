HOWEVER, GMC CLAIMS MY CAR \"ISN'T EFFECTED\" AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT.  MY ISSUES ARE 1. GETTING DANGEROUS,  AS THE CAR BOGS AND WON'T ACCELERATE WITHOUT A PERIOD OF HESITATION AND THEN IT GIVES TOO MUCH ACCELERATION WHICH CAN BE BAD IF I'M ON A SLIPPERY SURFACE.  ALSO, THERE IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THESE VEHICLES WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM I AM EXPERIENCING:  2. MY ABS KICKS IN RANDOMLY, EVEN IF THE PAVEMENT IS TOTALLY DRY AND CLEAR.  APPARENTLY, THIS IS CAUSED BY A CORRODED MOUNTING SURFACE FOR THE FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSORS. THE CORROSION BUILDS UP CAUSING EXCESSIVE GAP BETWEEN MOUNTING SURFACE AND WHEEL SPEED SENSOR WHICH CAUSES A LOSS OF WHEEL SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL. WHEN THE ABS MODULE SEES THE LOSS OF SIGNAL IT THINKS THE VEHICLE IS SLIDING OUT OF CONTROL SO IT WILL ACTIVATE THE TRACTION CONTROL OR ABS.   DESCRIPTION FROM RECALL #05068:  CERTAIN PICKUP TRUCKS AND SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES MAY EXPERIENCE UNWANTED ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) ACTIVATION.

IT WAS SNOWING AND ABOUT 11:30 AT NIGHT. WE SLID SIDEWAYS DOWN THE HILL AND ACROSS ROUTE 28. THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED US FROM ROLLING OVER AN EMBANKMENT WAS THE NEW METAL GUARDRAIL THAT WAS RECENTLY INSTALLED ALONG ROUTE 28. FORTUNATELY, WE WERE NOT INJURED, AND THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE ON THE ROAD. I EXPERIENCED IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR. IT WAS NOT A SLOW PROCESS. OUR YUKON IS WELL MAINTAINED AND HAS ONLY 89,000 MILES ON IT.   1 - MY LOCAL DEALER, WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE BRAND NEW, AND WHO INSPECTED MY VEHICLE BRAKE LINE FAILURE AND QUOTED THE REPAIRS, DENIED A BACKUP SYSTEM IN THE EVENT OF A BRAKE LINE FAILURE. 2 - A DIFFERENT REPAIR SHOP SAID THAT ALL FIVE OF MY BRAKE LINES HAD FAILED AND WERE LEAKING FLUID DURING A TEST TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM. 3 - I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED BY FOUR DIFFERENT REPAIR SHOPS, WITHIN ONE WEEKS TIME, AND THEY ALL CONFIRM FAILURE OF THE BRAKE FLUID LINES DUE TO RUST.  I DID NOT YET HAVE THE BRAKES REPAIRED YET BECAUSE THE QUOTES WERE SO HIGH. MANY NEW YORKERS MAY HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS BRAKE LINE FAILURE , OR ARE STILL AT RISK OF A SERIOUS, OR FATAL ACCIDENT. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SERIOUS INJURIES AND POSSIBLY DEATHS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THIS BRAKE LINE FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT ACCIDENT FILES BE REVIEWED BY VEHICLE YEAR AND MODEL, AS LISTED IN THE NHTSA INVESTIGATION REPORT, TO SEE IF THERE IS A CORRELATION.

THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO ABOUT 1/2 TO 3/4 INCHES ABOVE THE FLOORBOARD BEFORE I CAME TO A STOP...ABOUT 5-6 INCHES OF PEDAL PLAY. I IMMEDIATELY TRAVELED TO MY AUTO REPAIR BUSINESS DOING A LOT OF DOWNSHIFTING AND SLOW SPEED TRAVEL SO AS NOT TO CAUSE FURTHER DAMAGE OR AN ACCIDENT. MY ABS HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED DUE TO CORROSION AND THE PROHIBITIVE COST OF REPAIRING/REPLACING IT(APPROX.$1600!!). I JUST DRIVE CAUTIOUSLY JUST LIKE WHEN ABS DIDN'T EXIST.  THE TECHNICIAN INSPECTED, HE FOUND 2 FAILED LEAKING STEEL BRAKE LINES...THE REST OF THE BRAKE LINES WERE SEVERELY RUSTED. THE TECH RE-CONSTRUCTED THE BRAKE LINES FROM SCRATCH USING A CORROSION-RESISTANT ALLOY TUBING. THIS TUBING SHOULD NOT NEED REPLACING AGAIN. TECH ALSO LABORED AND EXTRACTED BRAKE BLEED VALVES FROM CALIPERS. THESE WERE TINY RUSTED NUBS. TECH RE-ASSEMBLED, FILLED AND BLED THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM, RE-TESTED FOR LEAKS AND PROPER OPERATION.ALL REPLACEMENT LINES WERE CUSTOM-BENT FROM BULK TUBING. THE BLEEDING PROCESS TOOK OVER 2 HOURS BECAUSE THE ABS UNIT WAS IN-OPERATIVE. 10 1/2 HRS OF TECH'S TIME WAS USED. THE ACTUAL BRAKES AND COMPONENTS AT THE4 WHEELS REMAIN UNCHANGED.  THE ENTIRE BILL CAME OUT AT CLOSE TO $1100 BUT WAS DISCOUNTED BY $200 DUE TO CUSTOMER LOYALTY,THANKS!!!  THERE ARE CLOSE TO 900 COMPLAINTS ALREADY CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM WITH THESE FULL-SIZED GM PRODUCTS. YES I DO LIVE IN THE SO=CALLED RUST-BELT( CLEVELAND OHIO AREA).

I BELIEVE THIS COULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE. THE ISSUE ITSELF IS THE TRUCK KICKS INTO \"REDUCED ENGINE POWER\" MODE AND THEN IT DOES NOT GO ANY FASTER THAN IDLE WHICH MEANS IT ALL OF THE SUDDEN REDUCES THE SPEED TO 5 MPH MAXIMUM AS WELL AS THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT AND THE ABS BRAKES. THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS IF YOU ARE ON THE HIGHWAY. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TROUBLESHOOTING THE ISSUE WITH NO SOLID FIXES FROM WHAT I CAN FIND. I BELIEVE GM SHOULD COME UP WITH A FIX SO THAT ISN'T A DANGEROUS HAZARD TO CONSUMERS AND OWNERS OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE THERE 2003 MODEL YEARS, IT SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY THERE 2003 MODEL YEARS.

I WAS ALMOST STRUCK IN AN INTERSECTION WHILE WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ON A GREEN LIGHT IN EARLY DECEMBER OF 2011.  I WAS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION WAITING TO TURN LEFT.

ANOTHER RELATED ISSUE IS THE ABS ENGAGING FOR NO REASON.  THIS ALSO HAPPENS AT LOW SPEEDS (LESS THAN 10 MPH).

SIGNAL LIGHTS, STOP LIGHTS, HEAD LIGHTS, ETC) BEGAN TO MALFUNCTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, I WOULD TRIGGER THE SIGNAL FOR ONE DIRECTION AND ALL OF THE SIGNALS FOR ALL DIRECTIONS WOULD TRIGGER...  EVEN PRESSING THE BRAKES TRIGGERED ALL OF THE EXTERIOR SIGNALS. THE DEALER HAD A HARD TIME ISOLATING MY PROBLEM, BUT AFTER SEVERAL VISITS, THE DEALER WAS FINALLY ABLE TO DIAGNOSE AND RECTIFY IT... THEY ISOLATED IT TO A JUNCTION BOX WHERE ALL OF THE ELECTRONICS TERMINATE.  HOWEVER, BY THIS TIME, MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SO I HAD TO COVER   THE COSTS FOR REPAIRING THE PROBLEM MYSELF.  MY MOST RECENT ISSUES, WHICH, BY THE WAY, SEEM TO BE  COMMON ISSUES, ARE TRIGGERED BY A MESSAGE STATING, \"REDUCED ENGINE POWER\".  THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE DOES NOT ALWAYS RENDER THE SAME RESULTS... SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE'S SPEED WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE TO NEARLY A HALT, BUT OTHER TIMES I MAY JUST EXPERIENCE INCREASED IDLING OF THE ENGINE, EVEN IF I AM AT A COMPLETE STOP.  MY UNDERSTANDING, ACCORDING TO HUNDREDS OF REPORTS THAT I HAVE READ ON THE MESSAGE BOARDS, IS THAT THIS ISSUE IS CAUSED BY EITHER A WIRING HARNESS THAT LEADS FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO THE THROTTLE BODY OR IT'S A DEFECTIVE THROTTLE BODY ALTOGETHER.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED INTERMITTENT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH MY WINDOWS AS WELL, BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE A   MINOR ISSUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO THAT I ADDRESSED ABOVE.  I WILL FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH GMC CORPORATE OFFICE TODAY AND SEE WHERE THAT GOES.  *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP FOUND THAT THE BRAKE LINES WERE ALL SEVERELY CORRODED AND THAT ONE OR BOTH OF THE LINES GOING TO THE MASTER CYLINDER HAD STARTED LEAKING. THEY REPLACED THE LINES AND ATTEMPTED TO BLEED THE BRAKES BUT THEY WERE NOT TOTALLY SUCCESSFUL DUE TO A COMBINATION OF THE SOPHISTOCATION OF THE ABS SYSTEM AND THE INEXPERIENCE OF THE MECHANIC ON DUTY AT THE TIME.

DUE TO LOW SPEED (<20 MPH) AT THE TIME, I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE USING THE PARKING BRAKE. HAD THIS OCCURRED MOMENTS EARLIER WHILE DECELERATING FROM THE FREEWAY INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN FATALITIES. WHILE STOPPING, SMOKE WAS SEEN COMING FROM THE FRONT AND LEFT WHEEL WELL OF THE VEHICLE. AFTER STOPPING, I EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THE METAL BRAKE LINE HAD RUPTURED WHERE IT CROSSES OVER THE FRAME RAIL LEADING TO THE FRONT LEFT BRAKE. THERE WAS BRAKE FLUID SPRAYED AROUND THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE BAY, AND THE EXHAUST HEADER WAS STILL SMOKING. LUCKILY THE EXHAUST HEADER TEMPERATURE WAS LOW ENOUGH TO AVOID IGNITION OF THE BRAKE FLUID AND INITIATION OF FIRE. A LARGE PORTION OF BRAKE FLUID IN THE MASTER BRAKE RESERVOIR HAD LEAKED OUT LEAVING A TRAIL OF FLUID BEHIND THE VEHICLE ALONG THE LEFT SIDE. AN EXTREME LEVEL OF CORROSION AND FLAKING METAL WAS EVIDENT ALONG ALL THE METAL BRAKES LINES FROM FRONT TO REAR. INCIDENTALLY, THE POWER STEERING LINES WERE IN SIMILAR CONDITION. THE BRAKE LINE WALL THICKNESS IN THE RUPTURE AREA WAS SO THIN THAT IT COULD BE BENT AND CRUSHED WITH PRESSURE APPLIED BY THUMBNAIL. THE VEHICLE IS NOW AT THE LOCAL GMC DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS. BASED ON THE CONSISTENT AND EXCESSIVE CORROSION THROUGHOUT, I OPTED TO HAVE ALL THE BRAKE LINES AND POWER STEERING LINES REPLACED AT ONCE. BRAKES ARE THE MOST SAFETY CRITICAL DEVICE ON A MOVING VEHICLE AND MUST BE HELD TO HIGHER STANDARDS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER COMPONENT. THE CONDITION OF THE BRAKE LINES AND RUPTURE OF A BRAKE LINE IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A VEHICLE OF THIS YEAR AND MILEAGE. I RECENTLY SOLD A 1994 SUBURBAN THAT HAD BRAKE LINES IN MUCH BETTER CONDITION THAN THIS 2003 YUKON. CLEARLY THERE IS A MANUFACTURING OR QUALITY DEFECT IN THE LINES INSTALLED ON THIS 2003 YUKON.

THEN ON JUNE 5TH, WE WERE RETURNING FROM HOUSTON WHEN THE VEHICLE WITHOUT ANY WARNING GAVE A MESSAGE THAT THE ENGINE WAS GOING TO REDUCED POWER WHILE WE WERE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC.  WE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY TO A SAFE AREA TO PARK BECAUSE WE WERE A HAZARD TO OTHER DRIVERS.  THIS AFTERNOON I CALLED GENERAL MOTORS TO GET SOME RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD AGAIN THAT THE ENGINE WAS PROTECTING ITSELF FROM DAMAGE.  AGAIN, I ASKED IF IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE ENGINE THAN THE OCCUPANTS, THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS RATHER TESTY ABOUT THE ISSUE.  THERE WAS NO RESPONSE WHEN I SAID THAT NO AUTOMOBILE IN AMERICA SHOULD SHUT DOWN IN TRAFFIC FOR A NON EMERGENCY.  ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DRIVER LOOSES CONTROL OF THE OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE A PICTURE OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DURING THE REDUCED POWER INTERVAL WHICH SHOWS THAT ALL GAUGES WERE NORMAL SO THERE WAS NO REASON TO EXPECT ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE.  THE ENGINE WAS AT 500 RPM AND WOULD NOT GAIN SPEED. THIS IS CAUSING US TO FEAR DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.

IN THIS REDUCED POWER MODE, THE VEHICLE WILL REACH A TOP SPEED OF AROUND 25MPH.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO NUMEROUS GM DEALERS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, AND THEY HAVE REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLE AND WIRING HARNESS MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE PROBLEM KEEPS RECURRING.  I HAVE BOUGHT A SCANNER WHICH I CAN ERASE THE CODES BECAUSE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING 65MPH WITH SEMITRUCKS ON YOUR TAIL WHEN YOU SUDDENLY FOR NO REASON LOSE POWER AND CAN'T GET OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CLOSE EPISODES WHERE WE WERE ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT.  AFTER THE THROTTLE BODY WAS REPLACED IN DEC 08, THE REDUCED ENGINE POWER DIDN'T COME BACK UNTIL APRIL 2009.  DEALER THEN REWIRED THE HARNESS AND IT STOPPED UNTIL THE FALL OF 2009.  SINCE FALL 2009, THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT AND REDUCED POWER MODE COME ON SPORADICALLY.  IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED, BUT NOW THE TRUCK STALLS WHEN THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND REDUCED ENGINE POWER IS ENABLED.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, AS DURING THE STALL, ALL POWER STEERING AND BRAKING IS LOST.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, TURNING, CROSSING TRAFFIC, AND THE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE TRUCK STALLS.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARY.  THE TRUCK HAS BEEN IN THE GM DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT FOR THE LAST 3 WEEKS.  EVERYTIME THEY SAY IT HAS TO BE THE THROTTLE BODY, THEY REPLACE IT, I BRING IT HOME AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER WE ARE BACK TO REDUCED ENGINE POWER WITH SERVICE ENGINE LIGHTS.  TROUBLE CODES ARE P2135, P0120, P1515, AND P0220.  I HAVE SPENT NEARLY $2000 ON SERVICE THAT HAS NOT RESOLVED THIS PROBLEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.  I HAVE READ ONLINE MANY OTHERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS TRUCK IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE NOW THAT IT STALLS EVERY TIME IT GOES INTO REDUCED ENGINE POWER MODE (WHICH HAPPENS MULTIPLE TIMES ON EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT). *TR",

AT MY REQUEST INSPECTED 4TH TIRE AND IT HAD A  BAD STEM AND WAS LEAKING.  ALL STEMS WERE THE TR-413 AND NOT A HIGH PRESSURE STEM.  THIS STEM IS FOR UP TO 40 PSI.  RECOMMENDED TIRE PRESSURE IS 35 PSI, BUT AT HIGH SPEEDS AND IN HOT TEXAS, PRESSURE FOR SURE RISES ABOVE THE MINIMUM 40 PSI.  ORIGINAL SPARE HAS HIGH PRESSURE VALVE STEM.  LUCKILY NO ONE WAS INJURED.  NOW I FOUND OUT THAT THESE STEMS ARE ON RECALL AND DEFECTIVE.  NTB WAS NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING AND THEY ARE THE EXPERTS.  HELP ME!!  *TR",

A FEW MONTHS AGO, AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE THE SPEEDOMETER JUMPED TO 60 MPH WHICH CAUSED THE NEEDLE TO READ 120 AT THE ACTUAL 60. IF YOU SHUT OFF THE IGNITION AND RESTARTED THE CAR, THE NEEDLE WOULD DROP ABOUT 5 MPH EACH TIME. IF YOU REPEATED THIS PROCEDURE (STARTING ENGINE, SHUTTING OFF ENGINE) AFTER 10-12 TIMES THE SPEEDOMETER WOULD READ ZERO AGAIN. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES. YESTERDAY AS I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY, WHERE THE SPEED IS 75 MPH, AND PULLED ONTO OUR LOCAL ROAD WHERE THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT IS 50, I NOTICED THAT I WAS HOLDING UP TRAFFIC ALTHOUGH THE SPEEDOMETER READ 50. I FELT AS IF I WAS NOT ACTUALLY DOING 50 SO I SPED UP EVEN THOUGH THE NEEDLE READ 65MPH. I PULLED OVER TO SEE IF INDEED THE SPEEDOMETER WAS READING INACCURATELY, AND IT WAS. THIS TIME STUCK AT 15 MPH. I AGAIN REPEATED THE ENGINE OFF/ON PROCEDURE TO GET THE NEEDLE BACK TO ZERO, BUT NOTICED IT JUMPING AND NOT RESPONDING QUICKLY AT STOP SIGNS. I HAVE READ REVIEWS ABOUT COMPLAINTS WITH THE SPEEDOMETERS BUT DO NOT SEE YUKON XLS AS PART OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES. THIS IS A VERY FRIGHTENING ISSUE AS I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD THAT WILL BE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ON HER OWN IN JUST A FEW MONTHS. I BELIEVE GM SHOULD ADDRESS THIS BEFORE SOMEONE'S DRIVING RECORD IS TARNISHED FOR UNINTENTIONAL SPEEDING RESULTING IN TICKETS AND INSURANCE INCREASES...AND POSSIBLY EVEN ACCIDENTS RESULTING IN DEATH.    COMPLAINT #2. FUEL GAUGE STICKS AT FULL MARK UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 1/4 TANK OF GAS IS USED, THEN GAUGE WILL DROP. ALSO STICKS AT 1/4 TANK THEN DROPS AGAIN TO EMPTY.

I TURNED AROUND AND WENT HOME. I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF. WHEN I STARTED IT UP A LITTLE WHILE LATER IT WAS FINE. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND THEY SAID THAT THIS WAS COMMON AND IT WAS DUE TO REFUELING WITH THE VEHICLE RUNNING OR A LOOSE GAS CAP...NEITHER OF THESE HAD HAPPENED IN MY CASE. THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY THREE CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE AND WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON RT. 95 WHEN THE VEHICLE JUST SHUT DOWN. I LOST ALL ABILITY TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START AND HAD TO BE TOWED. THE MECHANIC THAT TOWED IT READ THE DTC'S AND FOUND THE FOLLOWING: -CLASS 2 DATA LINK MALFUNCTION. - BODY CONTROL MODULE. - PCM TO TAC MODULE SERIAL DATA CONNECTION. I PLACED A CALL TO GMC ON 9/2 TO REPORT THE PROBLEM AND THE DANGER IT HAD PLACED MY FAMILY IN. THEY TOLD ME IT HAD TO GO TO A DEALERSHIP FOR AN OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE I HAVE FOUND THAT THE SAME PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED NUMEROUS TIMES W/ OTHER YUKONS AS WELL AS 2003 CHEVY AVALANCHES. AFTER READING THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS REGARDING THIS ISSUE IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT GMC IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE BUT HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE IT PUTTING MILLIONS AT RISK EVERY DAY.

AT APPROX. 12,500 MILES TOOK YUKON BACK TO DEALER TO REMEDY POPPING NOISE AND UNUSUAL WEAR/FEATHERING ON INSIDE TREAD OF F. TIRES. DEALER COULD NOT DUPLICATE NOISE. SAID ALIGNMENT WAS OFF AND NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. HAD TO PAY FOR ALIGNMENT/ROTATION. WIFE TOOK VEHICLE BACK WHEN TECH. WAS AVAILABLE TO RIDE ALONG.  WIFE WAS ABLE TO GET YUKON TO DUPLICATE NOISE WITH TECH. IN VEHICLE.  TSB SAID TO REMOVE BOLTS FROM CROSS MEMBER, BORE BOLT HOLES, LUBRICATE, REPLACE AND TORQUE.  DIDN'T GET OFF OF THE LOT BEFORE NOISE RETURNED.  NOW AT 25,000 MILES, AFTER MORE UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR AND THE UNRESOLVED POPPING NOISE, TOOK YUKON BACK AT DEALERSHIP.  SERVICE MANAGER ORDERED WASHERS AS PER NEW TSB FOR PERMANENT FIX OF POPPING NOISE AND IS EXPERIMENTING WITH ALIGNMENT TOLERANCES.  JUST DROVE 10 FEET OUT OF SERVICE AREA PARKING LOT AND POPPING NOISE IS EXACTLY THE SAME.  HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK IN ON MONDAY 08/08/05  SO THE SERVICE MANAGER CAN RIDE ALONG TO OBSERVE PROBLEM.  TALKED TO A FRONT END SPECIALIST AT WORK AND HE INDICATED THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING SAME PROBLEMS WITH OUR 2000 & UP G.M. FLEET VEHICLES.(100+)  SAID GM REP CAME TO INSPECT, NOTED THE PROBLEM AND LEFT.  FRONT-END SPECIALIST SAID THAT THERE IS A DEFECT IN GM TORSION BAR SUSPENSION SYSTEM THAT IS CAUSING MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT GM REPS WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OR REMEDY. *JB",
