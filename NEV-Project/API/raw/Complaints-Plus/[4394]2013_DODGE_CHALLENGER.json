I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE HAD MULTIPLE ENGINE PROBLEMS AND IT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER ENGINE TO BE PUT INTO THE CAR.  IN DECEMBER, I PICKED THE CAR UP AND HAD TO PAY $160.00 DEDUCTIBLE. I LOST TIME FROM WORK, AND ENDED UP BEING FIRED.       IN DECEMBER 2018, THE VEHICLE SUFFERED A THROTTLE PROBLEM.  AGAIN, I HAD TO PAY $ 114.00 DEDUCTIBLE AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS RELEASED (AFTER A WEEK).  NOW, JANUARY 2019, I HAVE AN OIL LEAK.  I WENT INTO TEXAN DODGE AND SPOKE TO MRS. SHEFFIE (AFTER CALLING HER MULTIPLE TIMES), AND SHE TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER DEDUCTIBLE AND THAT THE CAR HAD PRIOR ISSUES WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE.  I TOLD HER THAT THE VEHICLE HAD A NEW ENGINE THAT TEXAN DODGE (THEIR DEALERSHIP) PUT IN AND ALSO WORKED ON THE FAULTY THROTTLE IN 2018.  SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WANT SURE IF PLANET FORD (WITH THE EXTENDED WARRANTY) WOULD COVER THE OIL LEAK.  I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT A PRIOR CLAIM WAS PUT ON THE VEHICLE BEFORE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN OCTOBER 2018.     NOT ONLY AM I GETTING THE RUN AROUND, BUT I KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO THE PRIOR INSURANCE CLAIM THAT WAS PUT ON THE VEHICLE THAT PLANET FORD WAS AWARE OF THE DAMAGES TO THE VEHICLE.    I ALSO PAID 2 TIMES FOR DEDUCTIBLES AND NOW THE VEHICLE STILL HAS AN OIL LEAK.      THANK YOU.",

FROM DEC TO MAR 20TH, I WAS WITHOUT A CAR AND COVERT /FCA WOULD NOT PUT ME IN A RENTAL WHILE WAITING ON BACK ORDERED PARTS. ON MAR 20TH, THEY PUT ME IN A RENTAL VEHICLE. APR 20TH FCA CALLED TO TELL ME: 1) ALL 3 RECALLS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED 2) THE SMART GLASS WINDOW MODULE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT IS CAUSING THE BATTERY TO DRAIN, IS STILL ON BACKORDER (ETA MAY 29, BUT NOT A FIRM ETA AND THIS PART HAS BEEN ON BACKORDER SINCE JAN) BUT THE CAR CAN BE DRIVEN WITHOUT OPERABLE WINDOWS, 3) I NEED TO RETURN THE RENTAL IN 2 DAYS AND PICK UP MY CAR. I STATED THAT IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE A CAR WITH INOPERABLE WINDOWS (GETTING PULLED OVER AND HAVING TO OPEN MY DOOR TO TALK TO THE POLICE, EXTREMELY HOT WEATHER IN TEXAS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE WINDOWS, LITTLE KIDS AND CAR SICKNESS, UNABLE TO USE DRIVE-THROUGH ANYTHING, ETC). THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT HE CAN'T COMMENT ON SAFETY, BUT THE CAR IS DRIVABLE. THE CASE MANAGER AT FCA SAID THAT SHE CAN ONLY ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS IN BULLETINS FROM FCA.

LAST SUMMER, WE HAD ONE TIRE REPLACED DUE TO A NAIL IN THE SIDEWALL WITH THE SAME GOODYEAR TIRE (ALTHOUGH IT HAD A YEAR NEWER MANUFACTURED DATE CODE). THE OTHER 3 TIRES WERE STILL ORIGINAL. THE CAR IS NOW A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS OLD. THERE WERE ONLY 20K MILES ON THE CAR AND TIRES WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE. THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL CARED FOR AND STORED INSIDE. THE TIRES HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PRESSURES LESS THAN 32 POUNDS OF AIR IN THEM (DUE TO SENSORS MONITORING THE TIRES). THE WEEKEND OF 7/11/15 WE STARTED OUT ON A TRIP FROM CALDWELL, ID TO KALISPELL, MT (WE WERE TAKING THE SCENIC ROUTE ON WINDY BACK ROADS). WE GOT 50 MILES INTO OUR TRIP BEFORE WE GOT A LOW AIR PRESSURE WARNING ON ONE OF THE TIRE SENSORS (THE RIGHT REAR). WE STOPPED AND HAD THE TIRES CHECKED. THEY FOUND ALL 4 TIRES AT VARIOUS STAGES HAD THE INNER SIDEWALLS COMING APART ON THE TIRES (EVEN THE NEWER ONE WITH 10K MILES ON IT). WE HAD ALL OF THE TIRES REPLACED. I HAVE THESE OLD DEFECTIVE TIRES IN MY GARAGE. I DID NOT PUT GOODYEAR TIRES BACK ON THE CAR DUE TO THEM NOT BEING AVAILABLE AT THE TIRE STORE. I HAVE WORKED ON CARS ALL MY LIFE. THESE TIRES WERE NEVER ABUSED AND THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I FEAR FOR OTHERS LIVES. IF THE SIDEWALL OF ONE OF THESE TIRES COMPLETELY BLEW OUT, THE CAR WOULD LIKELY BE UNCONTROLLABLE. I HAVE DONE SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET AND I AM NOT THE FIRST TO EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF TIRE. I REALLY FEEL THIS IS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. WHEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH DODGE AND GOODYEAR, ALL THAT WAS OFFERED TO ME WAS A 'ROAD HAZARD' VOUCHER FOR $491 AND ONLY IF I PUT GOODYEAR TIRES BACK ON THE CAR. THEY WERE WELL AWARE I HAD ALREADY CHANGED THE TIRES AND DID NOT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN PUTTING UNSAFE GOODYEAR TIRES BACK ON MY CAR.",

WAS ALREADY MOVING SO I DROVE THE HALF MILE HOME PULLED IN GARAGE AND OPENED THE HOOD. THE ALTERNATOR WAS SMOKING HEAVILY. I PULLED THE CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE TURNED IT OFF, CALLED THE CHRYSLER RECALL LINE AND THEY SET UP TOWING TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP FOR THE NEXT MORNING.  IT TOOK 2 HOURS FOR THE ALTERNATOR TO QUIT SMOKING.  THE NEXT MORNING THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WAS COMPLETELY DEAD.  NO POWER ANYWHERE FOR ANYTHING. I CALLED SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF ELK GROVE CHRYSLER AND TALKED TO A SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT THE CAR COMING IN ON A FLAT BED.  WAS ADVISED THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE RECALL PROBLEM AND THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT AND THAT I COULDN'T GET A LOANER BECAUSE I HADN'T TAKEN OUT THE EXTENDED COVERAGE..??  HE SAID THE FIX MAY ONLY TRAKE THE ONE DAY ANYWAY SO NO NEED FOR A LOANER.  THE FIX TOOK 2 DAYS.    PICKED THE CAR UP AND SEEMS OK.  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT WAS FIXED WITH THE SAME TYPE OF ALTERNATOR THAT THE RECALL IS FOR.  STILL NO ALTERNATORS AVAILABLE THAT HAVE THE PROBLEMS CORRECTED SO I' RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED OR WORSE,  THIS WEBSITE NOW SHOWS MY CAR AS BEING FIXED AND HAVING NO APPLICABLE RECALLS.
