I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM OR A TIME FRAME TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE I DON'T DRIVE THIS TRUCK MUCH. NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DEALERSHIP'S INSPECTION OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL ONLY TO HAVE THEM TELL ME THAT IT'S INDEED BROKE AND THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO REPAIR IT UNDER THE RECALL. I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO BUT I'M HOPPING MAD BECAUSE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT OTHER GMC OWNERS PROBABLY HAD REPAIRED BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS MY BACK-UP VEHICLE, I'M PENALIZED FOR NOT HAVING THE PROBLEM SURFACE EARLIER BEFORE THE \"TIME\" FRAME EXPIRED.

APPLIED THE BRAKES TO FIND THAT THEY FELT MUSHY, AND BEFORE COMPLETELY STOPPING WENT TO THE FLOOR. I USED THE PARKING BRAKE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP WITHOUT CRASHING INTO THE CARS IN FRONT OF ME. WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I NURSED THE VEHICLE INTO A PARKING LOT USING THE PARKING BRAKE AND LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND COULD FIND NO ISSUE, THE WEATHER WAS VERY WET AND SLOPPY, AND LIGHT SNOW SO I COULD NOT SEE THE TELL TALE FLUID LEAKAGE FROM A BRAKE LINE. BECAUSE I HAD LOST ALL BRAKING I ASSUMED THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER HAD FAILED. I HAD CHANGED ALL CALIPERS, ROTORS AND PADS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE, AND AT 140,000 THOUGHT THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER FAILING WOULD BE UNUSUAL, BUT THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD CAUSE COMPLETE FAILURE. AFTER REPLACING THE MASTER I ATTEMPTED TO BLEED THE SYSTEM ONLY TO FIND THAT THE PROBLEM REMAINED. NOW THAT THE UNDER HOOD AREA WAS COMPLETELY DRY IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE FAILURE WAS RUST THROUGH AT A POINT THE LINE TO THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE FRAME RAIL BELOW THE MASTER CYLINDER. THE OIL CHANGE HAD PROBABLY CAUSED MOVEMENT OF THE LINE RESULTING IN THE FAILURE. MOVING SOME OF THE OTHER LINES MADE IT APPARENT THAT ALL OF THE HARD LINES WERE SHOT. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT CAUSED THEM TO FRACTURE. WORSE THAN THAT, THEY WERE ALL ENCASED IN A \"SHELL\" OF RUST FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER, CONCEALING HOW FRAGILE AND DANGEROUS THEY REALLY WERE. REPAIR ESTIMATES WERE ANYWHERE FROM $800 (LOCAL MECHANICS) TO $3,400 (GM DEALER). LOVELY.  I HAD A 1994 S10 BLAZER THAT I SOLD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WITH 290,000 MILES ON IT, ORIGINAL BRAKE LINES AND ALL.

MY INSURANCE COVERED IT BECAUSE A FUSE MELTED AND DID NOT DO IT'S JOB, HOWEVER NOW MY SPEEDOMETER DOES NOT WORK, AND THEY WANT ME TO PAY FOR A NEW WIRING HARNESS WHICH I WILL NOT DO. I USE MY GPS TO TRACK MY SPEED! THE REAR TRANSFER CASE WENT ON IT, AND I SPENT $1,800 TO HAVE A NEW ONE INSTALLED. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER SMALL THINGS, BUT THOSE ARE THE MAJOR PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD OVER THE YEARS.   I AM LIKE EVERY OTHER AVERAGE PERSON. I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO GET GM TO FIX THEM, SO I JUST PAID MYSELF!

I PULLED THE TRUCK OVER AND FOUND BRAKE FLUID COMING OUT FROM ABOVE THE GAS TANK. I CAREFULLY TOOK THE TRUCK OFF AT THE NEXT EXIT USING MY TRAILER BRAKES TO STOP THE VEHICLE. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE FIRST SERVICE STATION THAT I SAW AND HAD THEM LOOK AT IT. THEY FOUND THAT THE REAR BRAKE LINE HAD CORRODED AT A CLIP ABOVE THE FRAME RAIL ABOVE THE GAS TANK AND ADVISED ME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE REAR BRAKE LINE. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS STUCK AWAY FROM MY TOOLS AND SERVICE SHOPS THAT I USE AND WAS STUCK BEING GOUGED BY THE SERVICE CENTER THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET TO  FOR A REPAIR. AFTER I RETURNED HOME FROM VACATION I QUESTIONED THE MGT OF THE SERVICE CENTER ABOUT THE BILL. THEY CHECKED WITH THE LOCAL DEALER ABOUT THE HOURS FOR THE REPAIR AND THE LOCAL DEALER ADVISED THEM THAT THEY SEE THIS ALL THE TIME ON THIS VEHICLE. I LOOKED FOR A RECALL ON THIS AND FOUND NONE. I CONTACTED GM ABOUT THIS AS JUST ABOUT EVERYONE THAT I TALK TO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM HAS ALL SEEN IT. GM ADVISED ME THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED  PROBLEM AND THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP WITH THE REPAIR SINCE THE TRUCK WAS 9 YEARS OLD. I ADVISED THEM THAT THIS IS A COMMON  PROBLEM AND THEY DENY IT BUT THEY DID OFFER ME $2000 TOWARDS A NEW GM VEHICLE. I ADVISED THEM THAT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS AFTER AS I DO NOT NEED A NEW VEHICLE NOR WANT AN NEW VEHICLE. WHAT I DID ASK FOR WAS 50% OF WHAT THE REPAIR WAS AS IT WAS A 9 YEAR OLD TRUCK AND THEY REFUSED. THEY WILL NOT EVEN PUT THE REFUSAL IN WRITING. THIS NEEDS TO BE A RECALL BEFORE THIS PROBLEM KILLS SOMEONE AS IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM. I SEEN AN INVESTIGATION TO 03 BUT MINE IS 04 WITH SAME.  *TR",

WHILE MOVING MY 2004 GMC SIERRA 1500 TRUCK IN MY DRIVEWAY, MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE BRAKE LINE HAD BURST. THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT OR CHIME INDICATING A BRAKE SYSTEM ISSUE. THE DUAL MASTER CYLINDER SYSTEM ONLY PROVIDED ENOUGH BRAKING TO SLIGHTLY SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN AND THE PARKING BRAKE DIDN'T HELP MUCH. I HAD IT TOWED TO A SHOP AND THEY SAID IT WAS DUE TO A CORRODED STEEL BRAKE LINE. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THESE LINES FREQUENTLY IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CHEVROLET AND GMC PICKUP TRUCKS.  THEY REPLACED THE LINE AND I HAD PLANNED TO REPLACE ALL OF THE OTHER LINES IN A FEW MONTHS. TWO WEEKS AFTER THE REPAIR WAS DONE AND APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES LATER, ANOTHER LINE FAILED WHILE I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHTS OR CHIMES AND THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR.  I ESTIMATE THAT THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10% BRAKING POWER AND WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  THE PARKING BRAKE DID HELP SOME BUT IS NO A SUBSTITUTE FOR A REAL EMERGENCY BRAKE THAT THE OLDER VEHICLES USED TO HAVE. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS NOT EASY TO LIFT YOUR FOOT UP TO IT AS THE PEDAL IS MOUNTED SOMEWHAT HIGH OFF THE FLOOR. THE REPAIR SHOP SAID THAT THIS TIME IT WAS A STEEL LINE RUNNING TO THE MASTER CYLINDER AND COULD BE SEEN LEAKING FLUID FROM INSIDE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I HAD THEM REPLACE ALL THE LINES. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE NHTSA HASN'T DEMANDED A RECALL OF THESE VEHICLES FOR THE CORRODED BRAKE LINES AND THE FAILURE OF THE DUAL MASTER CYLINDER SYSTEM TO OFFER ANY RELIABLE METHOD OF STOPPING THE VEHICLE. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE MUCH OLDER THAN THIS TRUCK AND THEIR LINES WERE ALWAYS RUST FREE AND NEVER FAILED.

WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS VEHICLE WERE TRAVELING AT 70 MPH AND NEEDED TO STOP?  THIS IS FATALITY WAITING TO HAPPEN.  THIS SIZE OF TRUCK WOULD HAVE KILLED ME AND ANYONE I WOULD HAVE HIT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  SHAME ON YOU GMC.  BRAKES AND ROTORS WERE REPLACED 4 YEARS AGO.  EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS REPAIRED BY GMC CERTIFIED SHOP ALSO 4 YEARS AGO DUE TO FACT THE VACUUM PLATE RUSTED OFF.  THEY DID NOT INFORM ME OF ANY ISSUES OF BRAKE LINES RUSTING LIKE THIS OTHERWISE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN REPAIRED!  *TR",

YOU WOULD THINK THAT A VEHICLE OF THIS NATURE WOULD LAST LONGER THAN 100,000.  BUT APPARENTLY NOT... ALSO, WHEN THESE IS SUCH A MAJOR RECALL OUT ON A VEHICLE YOU WOULD THINK THAT GMC WOULD CONTACT YOU AND ADVISE YOU OF THIS PROBLEM..  *TR",

I GOT THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL GMC DEALER. LONG STORY SHORT, THEY WANTED $360 TO FIX THE BRAKE LINE. [XXX] THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT LOOKS LIKE THE REST OF THE LINES DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT EITHER. \"NOT GOOD!\" I GOT THE VEHICLE HOME, CALLED MY SON WHO IS A MECHANIC FOR A LOCAL JEEP DEALER AND HE FIXED THE LAST FOOT OR SO OF THE BRAKE LINE WHERE IT BLEW. HE SAID \"DAD COME HERE\". HE SHOWED ME UNDER THE HOOD WHERE THE VISIBLE  BRAKE LINES ARE VIRTUALLY ROTTED AND PROBABLY READY TO GO.  I AM PARTIALLY DISABLED AND OUT OF WORK.

I CANNOT KEEP THIS TRUCK LIKE THIS, I AM AFRAID I WILL ROLL INTO THE BACK OF SOMEONE AND I CANNOT TOW MY TRAILER ( SMALL BIKE TRAILER) FOR FEAR OF THE SAME.  WHEN WILL GM WAKE UP? *TR",

MY VEHICLE IS ALWAYS GARAGED AND REGULAR MAINTENANCE IS DONE.  THE DEALER THEN TOLD ME THAT SINCE WE LIVE IN A SNOW BELT STATE THAT I SHOULD EXPECT THIS AND THAT GMC WILL NOT HELP WITH THE REPAIR.

THE VIBRATION WAS SLIGHT AND NOT CONSTANT, NOT INDICATING A MAJOR PROBLEM. THE PART IN QUESTION IS A NON-SERVICEABLE PART, PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT PREVENT THIS FAILURE. THE TRANSFER CASE WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND WAS ON THE VERGE OF TOTAL LOCK UP WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE REAR WHEELS TO LOCK UP UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS. THE COST TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS OVER $3000 DOLLARS TO HAVE THE DEALER DO THE REPAIRS.
