I WALKED AWAY FROM THE CAR AND IT BEGAN TO ROLL BACKWARDS WHERE IT HIT MY BASKETBALL POLE AND CAUSED QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE TO THE CAR.  I THINK THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE KEYLESS ENTRY ON THIS VEHICLE.  WITH KEYED ENTRY VEHICLES YOU CAN NOT TURN OFF THE ENGINE WHILE IT IS IN DRIVE AND MUST BE PLACED IN PARK TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.  OTHER KEYLESS VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN SUCH AS THE AUDI A8 HAVE A FEATURE IF YOU TURN THE VEHICLE OFF WHILE IN DRIVE IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE CAR IN PARK.  THE PORSCHE PANAMERA, ON THE OTHER HAND, TAKES THE CAR OUT OF DRIVE AND PUTS IT INTO NEUTRAL SO THAT IT CAN ROLL FORWARD OR BACKWARD WHICH I BELIEVE IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION.  IN MY CASE, IT TOOK THE CAR OUT OF DRIVE AND MOVED TO NEUTRAL TO ALLOW IT TO ROLL BACKWARDS.  IF THERE WAS A CHILD BEHIND  MY CAR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.  I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF DESIGN FEATURE OF KEYLESS VEHICLES THAT WOULD PUT THE CAR IN TO PARK WHEN THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF OR AT LEAST NOT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO ACCIDENTALLY TURN OFF THE VEHICLE WILL IN STILL IN THE DRIVE POSITION.  I AM NOT SURE HOW OTHER MANUFACTURERS DEAL WITH KEYLESS ENTRY BUT I FEEL THE DESIGN OF THE PORSCHE WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A SERIOUS INJURY.   *JS",
