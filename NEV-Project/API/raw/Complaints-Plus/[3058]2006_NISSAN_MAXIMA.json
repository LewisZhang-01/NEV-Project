MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR THAT I HAD ONLY HAD SINCE 06/2010 NEEDED ITS TRANSMISSION REPLACED.  THANKFULLY WE HAD BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  WELL, 5 MONTHS LATER IN MAY OF 2011, MY CAR STARTED JERKING BADLY WHEN SHIFTING AND SOMETIMES DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO GEAR WHEN SHIFTING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE.  GUESS WHAT, NISSAN DEALERSHIP SAID THE LAST TRANSMISSION (2ND ONE FOR THE CAR THAT WAS 5 YEARS OLD HAD 85000 MILES ON IT)WAS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  AGAIN, IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN LESS THAN 12 MTHS OR 12000 MILES ON THE LAST TRANSMISSION THEY HAD PUT IN THE CAR.  SHOCKINGLY, HERE IT IS, A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS LATER AND GUESS WHAT????  MY CAR ISN'T WANTING TO GO INTO REVERSE OR DRIVE WITHOUT WAITING FOR 30-90 SECONDS.  CALLED THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE PRETTY SURE THE CAR NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION!!!!!!  THIS WILL BE THE 4TH TRANSMISSION THIS 7 YEAR OLD CAR HAS HAD.  IT HAS 125000 MILES ON THE CAR, SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE HAVING TRANSMISSION ISSUES NOW????  OH AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, THE CAR IS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE NISSAN WON'T COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THIS TRANSMISSION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 12000 MILES/12 MTHS SINCE THE LAST ONE WAS PUT IN!  SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH NISSAN TRANSMISSIONS AND I TOO WILL BE SURE TO NEVER PURCHASE A NISSAN EVER AGAIN AND WILL BE SURE TO LET ALL MY FRIENDS KNOW NOT TO EITHER!   *JS",

LUCKILY FOR US, WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT LIKE MANY PEOPLE IN THE CASES.  I THINK THAT A RECALL NEEDS TO BE PLACED IN ORDER DUE TO THIS DEFECT.

ONCE THE GEAR CHANGED OCCURRED  AND THE SPEED WAS CONSTANT IT SEEM TO CATCH AND GO INTO DRIVE AS NORMAL BUT THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THE JERK FORWARD WAS VERY NOTICEABLE AND VERY SCARY.  AS A RESULT I BROUGHT IT TO AN AUTO MECHANIC, THEY RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND A CODE CAME UP OF PO750.  THIS CODE RELATES TO THE SOLENOID PACK WHICH IS IN THE VALVE BODY AND A PART OF THE TRANSMISSION.  THE MECHANIC DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND FINALLY WENT TO THE NISSAN DEALER TO FIND OUT HOW THEY SOLVED THE PROBLEM AND THEIR ANSWER TO HIM WAS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION NOT THE SOLENOID PACK.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS \"DEFECT\" BECAUSE THEY HAD REPLACED QUITE A FEW TRANSMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM.  I THEN WENT ON TO A WEBSITE, ABOUTAUTOMOBILE.COM, AND FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM FOR THE 2006 MAXIMA.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT.  THE MEDIAN MILEAGE THAT THIS DEFECT OCCURS IS AROUND 77K.

I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM THE WALDORF, MD NISSAN DEALERSHIP. WHEN I WAS PURCHASING THIS CAR MY MAIN CONCERN WAS SAFETY. I WAS PREGNANT AND I HAD TWO OTHER SMALL CHILDREN THAT I TRANSPORT BACK AND FORTH FROM SCHOOL. NOW I DON'T EVEN FEEL SAFE TO HAVE MY CHILDREN IN MY CAR. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BOTTLE IN MY CAR OR BETTER YET GET ANOTHER TRANSMISSION DUE TO NISSAN BUILDING THESE CARS POORLY. ONE I AM A SINGLE WORKING PARENT TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY. AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH A CAR THAT HAS KNOWN TRANSMISSION ISSUES. I KNOW THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND THIS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL FOR THEM NOT TO FIX THE PROBLEM. WHAT IF ONE OF MY CHILDREN WHERE HURT DUE TO THE CAR JERKING OR DOWN SHIFTING WHEN IT ISN'T SUPPOSE TO. WHAT IF MYSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE LOST THEIR LIFE DUE TO NISSAN NOT WANTING TO FIX THE ISSUE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT. I PRAY THAT SOMEONE AT NISSAN WILL OWN UP TO THIS AND FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

THEY NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEY'RE ACTIONS AND DO A RECALL BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE MAXIMAS TRANSMISSION DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. I ALSO HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, PAY TO TOW THE CAR VARIOUS TIMES DUE TO THEM DEMANDING ME TAKE IT TO THEY'RE DEALER, AND I HAD TO PAY A STORAGE FEE FROM THEY'RE DEALER.

AT THAT TIME HE QUOTED ME $1800 FOR THE PART/LABOR, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE SO I AGREED TO COME BACK WHEN I RECEIVED MORE FINANCIAL AID FOR THE SPRING SEMESTER. WHEN I CONTACTED THE SHOP THIS TIME AROUND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE I'D UNFORTUNATELY NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION ALTOGETHER. A USED ONE ONLY HAS A 90 DAY WARRANTY AND HE QUOTED ME AROUND $2700-$3000. THE VALVE BODY COULD BE THE SAME DEFECTIVE ONE AS BEFORE, AND BEING USED, I COULD EASILY WIND UP IN THE SAME BOAT 90 DAYS LATER. HE SAID HE'D CALL BACK TO GIVE ME A QUOTE ON A REBUILT TRANSMISSION, BUT THAT IT WOULD COST MORE AND COME WITH A LONGER WARRANTY, POSSIBLY 2 YEARS. I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED. APPARENTLY SINCE I DIDN'T DIE YET OR CAUSE ANYONE ELSE TO DIE IT'S OK.  *TR",

THE DEFECT CAUSED WATER/MOISTURE TO BE RETAINED IN THE REAR HUB ASSEMBLY, RESULTING IN CORROSION TO THE HUB ASSEMBLY AND CAUSING THE ABS TO ENGAGE WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN.  IN DECEMBER 2010, THE DEALER PERFORMED A PROCEDURE WHERE THEY CUT A DRAIN CHANNEL TO ALLOW WATER TO DRAIN OUT OF THE RIGHT REAR HUB ASSEMBLY. THIS CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.

I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND LET IT SIT FOR A MINUTE AND STARTED IT AGAIN.  WHEN I DID THIS, I WAS ABLE TO GET FIRST GEAR TO ENGAGE ENOUGH TO ROLL TO A PARKING LOT.

ALSO TO GO FROM SECOND TO THIRD THE ENGINE WILL GO NEED TO GO ATHIGH REVOLUTIONS, IT MAY KILL THE ENGINE. AND AN ENGINE DEAD IN MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC IS A RECEIPT FOR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I HOPE YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS AND MAKE NISSAN FIX THEIR PROBLEMS. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT IN A CAR THAT COSTS 30K+ NEW HAS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW.  *TR",

IT WAS IN THE SHOP FOR 2 WEEKS THE LAST TIME, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I DO KNOW THAT I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A NISSAN VEHICLE ANYMORE, AND I WILL ADVISE MY FRIEND'S AND FAMILY TO DO THE SAME. I HATE IT WHEN MY FAMILY TELLS ME THAT I HAVE PURCHASED A LEMON! THAT'S EMBARRASSING. I HAVE A 3 MONTH OLD CAR THAT JERKS FOR NO REASON, AND THE CLUTCH ACTS UP. *TR",

NOW 8/2010 IT SHIFTS HARD FROM 1ST TO SECOND AND BACK FROM SECOND TO FIRST. THIS MAKES ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION EXTREMELY UNSAFE. SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE AND NISSAN NOT FIXING IT. CAR ONLY HAS 75,000 MILES AND IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.. I AM A SINGLE MOM AND ALWAYS HAVE CHILDREN IN MY VEHICLE. I AM CONTACTING AN ATTORNEY AND TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND IF NO RECOURSE I PRAY NO ONE GETS HURT.. INCLUDING ME CAUSE I CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH TOYOTA AND I REALLY WOULD HATE FOR IT TO HAPPEN WITH NISSAN. *TR",

AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF TRYING TO HOLD DOWN THE LOCK MANUALLY IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF MY CAR, I FINALLY TIMES IT RIGHT BEFORE THE LOCK SLAPPED BACK AND WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE. WE TOOK IT IN THE SHOP WHERE IT REMAINED FOR 6 DAYS. WE GOT IT BACK AND A FEW DAYS LATER THE HAZARD LIGHTS STOPPED WORKING, THE CENTER CONSOLE LIGHTS WOULDN'T LIGHT UP, AND ONE OF THE VENTS WOULDN'T TURN. THEY TOOK IT BACK IN FOR A DAY AND WE TOOK IT BACK HOME. IT WORKED PROPERLY FOR A DAY UNTIL THE LOCKS STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN. WE'VE HAD IT WITH THIS CAR. IT'S BEEN IN THE SHOP MORE THAN ITS BEEN WITH US, AND WE'VE ONLY OWNED IT 3 WEEKS. WE PAID $32K FOR A ROTTEN EGG AND WE'RE TIRED OF GETTING THE RUN AROUND.  *JB",
