The truck slid to a stop and blocked both the driveway and roadway. Police arrived shortly afterwards and made a report. Truck was not able to move on it's own and had to be towed to a repair shop.   Broken ball joint inspected and then replaced by my mechanic. Further damage occurred to the left front fender and drivers door from the wheel assembly slamming into the fender. Front fender damage caused the drivers door to jamb shut. The damaged fender had to be pried back to release the door so it could open.  (fender and door not repaired)   Fortunately I was alone and not injured if I had been driving at highway speeds I would have received serious injuries/death and possibly loosing control of vehicle causing possible injuries/death to others. No warning lights/messages were visible before or during the incident and the only symptom I observed was a slight creaking noise right before it happened.",

A Idaho state trooper investigated with video showing our totaled truck around a broken pole, no air bag or seat belt employed,My smashed face covered in blood. Did a little research and found that our 2000 tundra isnt in a recall???What does it take to set off a tundra airbag?? Also found out that I should be thankful it didnt go off or I may have been injured by a discharge of schrapnel??Found several victims of that. My wife takes a blood thinner and often goes with me to town,but now shes not going to be able to safely ride in her own vehicle anymore?? This reminds me of how CPS drops the ball and just lets kids die before they ever do anything. I will be doing alot more with my pen as my sword my video as my witness,I loved my tundra but this is more way more dangerous than my 1990 truck with basic mechanics.If you have a tundra or other vehicle that is dangerous ,speak out about it,get an attorney,Save SOMEONES LIFE.These are dangerous airbags,no doubt in my mind. Ps Our truck is 100% unmodified other than tire changes.Now a death trap, until this is resolved",

AT FIRST GLANCE UNDERCARRIAGE AND FRAME APPEARED TO BE IN GREAT SHAPE UNTIL I NOTICED UNDERCOATING THAT HAD LARGE BUBBLES IN IT. POKED AT THE BUBBLES WITH MY FINGER AND LARGE PIECES OF RUST FLAKED AWAY FROM THE FRAME AND FELL TO THE FLOOR. DISCOVERED MANY OF THESE SPOTS ON THE FRAME AND REAR LEAF SPRING SHACKLES. ONE AREA OF SPECIAL CONCERN IS REAR BRAKE LINES ARE RUBBING ON THE FRAME WHERE THE RUST HAS PUSHED A LEAF SPRING PLATE AWAY FROM THE FRAME AND HAS BEGUN TO SEPERATE. DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT HOW COMMON THIS IS ON TUNDRAS AND TACOMAS. ALSO FOUND OUT THAT TOYOTA HAS BEEN APPLYING SOME TYPE OF UNDERCOATING TO THESE FRAMES SO THEY ARE AWARE IT IS A PROBLEM.  CALLED TOYOTA AND THE AGREED TO INSPECT IT AT NO CHARGE. OF COURSE DEALER DID NOT SEEM TO THINK IT WAS A PROBLEM SO TOYOTA CUSTOMER RELATIONS WAS CONTACTED. GUESS WHAT? THEY SEE NO PROBLEM EITHER! APPARAENTLY TOYOTA IS SPRAYING THIS STUFF OVER THE RUST TO BUY THEM SOME TIME. NOW I FIND OUT THEY HAD BEEN REPLACING THESE FRAMES BUT THAT EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2012? THE TACOMA HAS A 15 YR UNLIMITED MILEAGE WARRENTY ON THE FRAME? IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THIS SEEM A LITTLE ODD? PARTS OF THE FRAME ARE PAPER THIN AND I PERSONALLY DO NOT FEEL IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  I WILL BE STAYING IN TOUCH WITH TOYOTA ABOUT THIS AND I WILL NOT SETTLE FOR THE ANSWER THEY ARE GIVING ME. HOW CAN THEY ADMIT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND THEN AT THE END OF 2012 JUST PULL THE PLUG AND PRETEND IT IS NOT A PROBLEM ANY MORE? I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME TO GET TOGETHER WITH THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE TO START A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.  *TT",

I CONTACTED TOYOTA WHO TOLD ME THAT THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN COLDER CLIMATES BUT WHEN PRESSED SHE SAID THAT I COULD GET IT INSPECTED AND ALSO HAVE THE FUEL TANK STRAPS INSPECTED AS THERE HAD BE RUST ISSUES WITH THESE ON THE 2000 TUNDRA. WHEN I ASKED IF THERE WOULD BE A RECALL OR NOTIFICATION, I WAS TOLD NO.  THIS IS APPALLING. THE TIRE EASILY COULD HAVE FALLEN OFF WHILE BEING DRIVEN AND NOW A FUEL TANK HOLDER MAY BE RUSTED.

THE ESTIMATE SAID THAT THE FRONT DRIVER BRAKE LINES AND JUNCTION BOX WERE RUSTED THROUGH.  THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PIVOT WAS RUSTED & SEIZED ON BOTH SIDES AND COMPLETELY INOPERABLE, AND THE FRONT SWAY BAR LINK WAS RUSTED THROUGH.

THE EMERGENCY BRAKE DID NOT HOLD THE CAR AND NEEDED ADJUSTMENT, SO THE FOLLOWING DAY, 11/3/09, WE TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL DEALER, COLONIAL TOYOTA OF MILFORD. WE ASKED FOR A BRAKE ADJUSTMENT AND A FRAME INSPECTION.  THE NEXT DAY, 11/04/09, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM COLONIAL TOYOTA, SAYING THAT OUR TUNDRA FRAME HAD HOLES IN IT AND WE \"SHOULD NOT PUT ANOTHER DIME INTO IT\" AND \"IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE\".

FAR WORSE THAN I'VE SEEN ON ANY TOYOTA TACOMA THAT WAS RECALLED. BUT, FOR SOME REASON TOYOTA DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE ON THESE TRUCKS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I WON'T BE ABLE TO PASS A STATE INSPECTION AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. SO THAT LEAVES ME MAKING PAYMENTS ON A TRUCK THAT I CAN NOT DRIVE. OVER THIS PAST SUMMER, I NEEDED TO TRAVEL 500 MILE ROUND TRIPS FOR SEVERAL WEEKENDS FOR MEDICAL REASONS. KNOWING THAT I HAD SOME UNDERBODY CLUNKS GOING ON, I FIGURED I'D INVESTIGATE PRIOR TO MAKING THESE MANY TRIPS. I FOUND THAT THE UPPER SHOCK TOWERS WERE NO LONGER ATTACHED TO THE FRAME OF THE TRUCK, AND THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF MY CLUNK. I DECIDED TO PULL OFF THE BED OF THE TRUCK TO GET A BETTER ACCESS TO THESE ROTTED SPOTS. ONCE THE BED WAS REMOVED, I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT MY PROBLEM WAS FAR WORSE THAN I IMAGINED. I FOUND 21 ROT HOLES JUST IN THE SIX FOOT SECTION OF FRAME UNDER THE BED. I FOUND THAT MY SHOCK TOWERS HAD PULLED AWAY FROM THEIR FRAME MOUNTS DUE TO RUST. THE SCARIEST FIND WAS THAT THE CROSS MEMBER THAT SUPPORTS THE SPARE TIRE HAD THREE OUT OF THE FOUR MOUNTING CORNERS COMPLETELY ROTTED OFF. HERE'S WHERE I GET CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE TRAVELING BEHIND ME. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THIS CROSS MEMBER AND SPARE RIM/TIRE FELL OFF AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS? THIS IS THE POINT WHERE I CONTACT MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER. THE SERVICE ADVISOR TELLS ME THAT TOYOTA ISN'T DOING ANYTHING FOR ME AT THIS TIME, AND TO REMAIN PATIENT. FRAME ROT IN 8 YEARS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? KNOWING THAT I HAVE ALL THIS WEEKLY TRAVEL AHEAD OF ME, I ASKED HIM IF IT WOULD HURT MY FUTURE CHANCES OF A RECALL IF I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY SOME TEMPORARY WELDS TO THE FRAME TO FEEL A LITTLE SAFER IN MY TRAVELS. HE SAID THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD BE FINE. SOME OF THOSE REPAIRS DID NOT HOLD DUE TO POOR METAL. WHAT MORE CAN I DO? HELP!! *TR",

TOOK IT TO THE DEALER (TRI-STATE TOYOTA SCION AND DODGE).  I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LADY.  SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE RUST PROBLEM THEY HAD WITH BOTH THE TACOMA'S AND TUNDRA'S AND SAID THE WOULD CHECK MY TRUCK OUT FOR FRAME CORROSION.  WITHOUT SHOWING ME THEY SAID THERE WAS NONE.  THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THE COST TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND WAS A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT.  IT THEN GOT INSPECTED BY AN AUTOBODY SPECIALIST.  PRECISION AUTO REPAIR LOOK AT IT AND SAID THE FRAME IS JUNK JUST LIKE THE TACOMA'S.  I ASK JIM AUDETT THE OWNER FOR A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE SO I COULD SEND TO TOYOTA.  THE POWER STEERING RACK HAD BROKEN AWAY FROM THE FRAME AND CHUNK'S OF THE FRAME (METAL ARE FALLING OFF THIS TRUCK).  THE INTEGRITY OF THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY THE CORROSION  AND IS NOT A ROAD WORTHY VEHICLE. I SPENT $19,000 FOR THIS TRUCK IN EARLY JANUARY 2007 ABOUT 14 MOTHS BEFORE TOYOTA DID THE RECALL ON THE TACOMA'S. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN AROUND BY THE DEALER AND TOYOTA FOR ALMOST A YEAR.  I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN AND SENT TO ATTORNEY GENERALS OF BOTH MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT TO INFORM THEM OF THIS POTENTIAL ROAD HAZARD TO ALL.  IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED IF YOUR AGENCY COULD LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE TOYOTA IS RELUCTANT TO STAND BEHIND THIS POOR QUALITY VEHICLE.  THEY HAVE DENIED THERE WAS ANY CORROSION.

AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION, THE AUTO MECHANIC FOUND MOST OF THE FRAME WAS RUSTED AND LARGE CHUNKS OF RUST WERE FALLING OFF THE FRAME, AS HE WAS INSPECTING IT. THE AUTO MECHANIC INFORMED ME THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND TOLD ME TO NO LONGER DRIVE THE VEHICLE. I'VE CONTACTED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS, BUT WAS INFORMED CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO COVER THE RUSTED FRAME ISSUE. THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 9 YEARS OLD WITH 113K MILES. OTHER THAN THE RUSTED FRAME SAFETY ISSUE, THE TRUCK LOOKS AND RUNS GREAT. EVEN THE SERVICE MANAGER AT MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER STATED THE FRAME SHOULD NOT BE RUSTED AFTER 9 YEARS, EVEN IF I DO LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND. MY TRUCK IS NOW PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY. I CAN'T DRIVE IT, I CAN'T TRADE IT IN, AND I CAN'T SELL IT. PER YOUR SITE AND OTHER TRUCK FORUMS, THERE ARE MULTIPLE (HUNDREDS?) TOYOTA TUNDRA COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE THAT TOYOTA IS NOT ADDRESSING. I WOULDN'T EXPECT THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FROM ANY AUTOMOTIVE COMPANY, BUT I'M VERY UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT TOYOTA IS NOT BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS MANUFACTURING QUALITY ISSUE.

I CALLED TOYOTA IN CA, GOT A CASE #..BUT THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I STILL OWE $5000.00 ON A TRUCK I CAN NOT DRIVE. I DID BUY THIS AS A USED TRUCK IN 2004, AND IT WAS FINE AT THAT TIME. THEY TRIED TO TELL ME IT HAD TO DO WITH THE SALT USED IN NE...HOWEVER..I SEE THE SAME PROBLEM IN TEXAS AND OTHER WARM STATES. THEY HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE TACOMA...I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH..ALL THE STEEL FOR THE FRAMES CAME FROM THE SAME COMPANY...DANA CORP..IN OHIO. THEY JUST CAME OUT OF CHAPTER 11 AND HAVE A NEW CEO....WHO WORKED FOR TOYOTA. HOW MANY MORE TRUCKS ARE ON THE ROAD WITH THE BAD FRAMES??? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE KILLED BEFORE ANYTHING WILL BE DONE?? I HAVE OWNED TOYOTA'S SINCE 1977 AND THIS IS THE FIRST PROBLEM I HAVE HAD. I ALSO HAVE A 2007 CAMRY...NO PROBLEM. WHEN IS TOYOTA GOING TO OWN UP TO THE FACT..IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM THEY HAD WITH THE TACOMA???  IT ALL GOES BACK TO DANE CORP. I WANT SOMETHING DONE AND I WANT IT DONE NOW!!!!!! I AM WRITING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN NH AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WILL GO TO THE MEDIA IF I HAVE TO. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE!!! SINCE WHEN DOES A COMPANY NOT BACK IT'S PRODUCT??? I URGE YOU TO HAVE TOYOTA ISSUE A RECALL AND HELP US AS THEY DID FOR OWNERS OF THE TACOMA. THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A COMPANY!!!  NOT 1 PERSON FROM TOYOTA HAS CONTACTED ME TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP IN ANY WAY..I HAVE DONE ALL THE CALLING AND GOTTEN NO WHERE. PLEASE KEEP ME INFORMED AS TO WHAT IS BEING DONE.

HOWEVER, IT HAS EXCESSIVE FRAME RUST FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS NOT YET 9 YEARS OLD.   METAL ON THE FRAME IS RUSTING AND FLAKING OFF IN LARGE SHEETS. IT IS RUSTING WAY TO SOON, AND MUCH TOO QUICKLY. I KNEW THE TRUCK WAS RUSTING PREMATURELY, BUT WASN'T ACTUALLY AWARE OF HOW BAD IT WAS UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN IT WAS UP ON A LIFT.  THE REAR SHOCK HOUSINGS ARE RUSTING RIGHT THROUGH TO THE PISTONS. THE WELDS THAT HOLD THE LEAF-SPRING MOUNTS TO THE FRAME ARE SO BADLY RUSTED, I'M AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO LET GO AND DISLODGE FROM THE FRAME. BOTH FRONT STABILIZER LINKS HAVE RUSTED AND SNAPPED OFF. REMOVING ANY BOLTS FROM THE FRAME FOR SERVICE (EXHAUST, OXYGEN SENSORS, ETC.) IS A CHORE AND REQUIRES PRE-TREATING THE AFFECTED AREAS WITH A RUST PENETRANT FOR DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL REMOVAL (IF THEY CAN EVEN BE REMOVED).  AT ONE POINT LAST YEAR DURING ROUTINE SERVICE, I MENTIONED TO THE DEALER THAT MY TUNDRA WAS RUSTING EXCESSIVELY, SIMILAR TO THE TACOMAS.

THE VEHICLE HAD 12,894 MILES AT THE TIME. THE WARPED FRONT ROTORS WERE RESURFACED AND THE BRAKE PADS REPLACED.  NEITHER THE FRONT ROTORS NOR THE CALIPERS WERE REPLACED.  I WAS INFORMED AT THE TIME THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT HAD BEEN MACHINED OFF THE ROTORS. THE PROBLEM QUICKLY REAPPEARED AND HAS GRADUALLY WORSENED OVER THE LAST 16,000 MILES. THE CAR IS DRIVEN VERY LIGHTLY AND HAS TOWED A HORSE TRAILER FOR APPROXIMATELY 200-300 MILES.    TODAY THE TRUCK HAS 28, 600 MILES AND IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON ANY ROAD, BUT PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS ON LONGER DOWNHILL GRADES. I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALERSHIP EARLY IN JUNE 2006 WHEN I HAD DEFECTIVE OXYGEN SENSORS REPLACED. THEY CHECKED FOR RECALL NOTICES AND FOUND NONE. CURIOUSLY, THEY DID NOT NOTIFY ME OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003. BASICALLY, THEY SAID IT WOULD COST ME A LOT OF MONEY TO HAVE THEM REPAIRED.    IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM RESULTS FROM DEFECTIVE FRONT BRAKES, AND THIS DEFECT EXISTED AT THE TIME THE VEHICLE LEFT TOYOTA'S POSSESSION, I ASKED TOYOTA TO PROPERLY REPAIR THE BRAKES BEFORE SERIOUS PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY OCCURS.    TOYOTA RESPONDED TO MY REQUEST ON JUNE 15, 2006 AS FOLLOWS:    \"WE HAVE CHECKED YOUR VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VIN#) AND THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING SPECIAL SERVICE CAMPAIGNS ON YOUR VEHICLE AT THIS TIME.  THE WARRANTY FOR YOUR BRAKING SYSTEM (EXCLUDING WEAR ITEMS) IS 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE FOR YOUR VEHICLE. BASED ON THE VIN (VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER) YOU PROVIDED. YOUR WARRANTY COVERAGE STARTED ON 3/15/2000.

ALSO DISCOVERED WAS THE FACT THAT TOYOTA HAS ISSUED NUMEROUS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ON THIS PROBLEM WHICH INDIRECTLY INDICATE THAT IT PRODUCED THE VEHICLE WITH BRAKES THAT WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD UP TO THE HEAT GENERATED ON THIS VEHICLE.  SOME CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING THEIR BRAKE COMPONENTS REPLACED WITH BETTER ONES AT NO CHARGE.  COMPARATIVELY, TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IN MY AREA HAVE BEEN VERY UNCOOPERATIVE.

THEY WERE GROUNDED THREE TIMES. TOYOTA ISSUED A FRONT BRAKE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) ON 03/10/2000 APPLICABLE TO THE 2000 TUNDRA. TOYOTA ISSUED A REAR BRAKE TSB ON 10/17/2000 APPLICABLE TO THE 2000 AND 2001 TUNDRA. TOYOTA ISSUED A REAR BRAKE TSB ON 09/16/2002 APPLICABLE TO THE 2000, 2001 AND 2002 TUNDRA. TOYOTA ISSUED A FRONT BRAKE TSB ON 09/16/2002 APPLICABLE TO THE 2000, 2001, 2002 AND 2003 TUNDRA. ACCORDING TO TOYOTA WRITTEN INFORMATION THE FRONT BRAKE PROBLEM HAS A DEFECTIVE CALIPER ASSEMBLIES.  THE REAR PROBLEM IS BRAKE DRUMS WITH INSUFFICIENT MASS AND DEFECTIVE ADJUSTERS. (I GOT TSB AND REPAIR MANUAL INFORMATION ON TECHINFO.TOYOTA.COM AFTER A $50 SUBSCRIPTION FEE.) I PRESENTED ALL THIS TO TOYOTA'S DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM UNDER THE MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY ACT (15 U.S.C. SECTIONS 2301-2312 AND 16 CFR SECTION 703). THE MECHANISM IS ADMINISTERED BY NATIONAL CENTER FOR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (NCDS). THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE ADMITTED DURING THE HEARING THAT THE BRAKES WERE NON-CONFORMING/DEFECTIVE. THE ARBITRATION PROCESS WAS GROSSLY FLAWED. MOST DEFECTIVE WAS THE ARBITRATOR BASED HIS DECISION ON A NON-APPLICABLE STATE LAW INSTEAD OF THE MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY ACT. NCDS TOLD HIM TO CONSIDER THE NON-APPLICABLE LAW. MAGNUSON-MOSS IS VERY SPECIFIC IF THEY CAN'T FIX IT AFTER A REASONABLE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS; THEY REPLACE IT OR BUY IT BACK WITH NO DEPRECIATION. TOYOTA'S CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVE OFFICE POSITION IS SINCE NHTSA HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL, THE VEHICLES ARE STILL USABLE AND MAGNUSON-MOSS DOES NOT APPLY. NHTSA SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ABOVE.

NOT RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM AS A \u001cWARRANTY ISSUE,\u001d I TOOK MY TRUCK TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP.  THEY INDICATED  THAT THE FRONT DISCS WERE PROBABLY WARPED AND THAT TURNING THEM WOULD DO THE TRICK.  AFTER THE FRONT BRAKE JOB, THE PROBLEM REMAINED.  I THEN TRIED NEW TIRES AND A WHEEL ALIGNMENT WITH NO IMPROVEMENT.  IT WAS AFTER ALL OF THIS THAT I LEARNED THAT THIS IS A TUNDRA-WIDE PROBLEM.  WHEN I INQUIRED WITH TOYOTA TO HAVE THE REPAIRS COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY, THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT HELP IN THE COST OF MY REPAIRS BECAUSE I WAS OVER THE 36,000 MILES OF MY WARRANTY.  WITH FOUR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ISSUED ON THIS MATTER PRIOR TO OCT 2002 (AND ONE JUST AFTER), TOYOTA  KNEW THEY HAD A TUNDRA BRAKE PROBLEM.  CONSIDERING THE SERIOUSNESS OF A FLAWED BRAKING SYSTEM, I BELIEVE, TOYOTA HAD A MORAL OBLIGATION TO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY ALL TUNDRA OWNERS OF THEIR DEFECTIVE BRAKES.  IF TOYOTA HAD DONE SO IN A RESPONSIBLE AND TIMELY MANNER, THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE 36,000 MILE PORTION OF MY WARRANTY.  IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THEIR GROSS NEGLIGENCE THAT IT WAS NOT.    FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE ENTIRE BRAKING SYSTEM, BOTH FRONT AND REAR, WAS NOT ENGINEERED PROPERLY.

FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRES I HAVE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS SOON?  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN, THANK YOU.( DOT NUMBER: BM13571-4 TIRE SIZE: P265/75R15 )",
