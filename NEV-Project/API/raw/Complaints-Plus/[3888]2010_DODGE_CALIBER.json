WENT TO THE DODGE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THROTTLE BODY WAS SO DIRTY IT NEEDED CLEANING. I GOT IT CLEANED THIS PAST FRIDAY AND GUESS WHAT WAS HAPPENING BY SATURDAY. WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY AND TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR TO DRIVE IT WITH ME IN THERE AND IT SHOWED OUT. HE SPEED UP ON THE FREEWAY AND THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON FLASHING AND WE WERE GOING SO SLOW HE TURNED ON THE HAZARDS.

THIS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE IT IS A SAFETY/POWER ISSUE WITH THE MODEL.  WHY WOULD THIS JUST BE HAPPENING TO OUR 2 VEHICLES?  HER VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IN GA AND MINE IN MI.    I DO A LOT OF FREEWAY DRIVING.  EACH TIME THIS OCCURRED, I WAS DRIVING ON FREEWAYS AT 70 MPH FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME.  I TAKE AN EXIT.  WHEN I DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR TO TURN OFF THE EXIT RAMP, THE ENGINE COMPLETELY \"BOGS DOWN\".  THERE IS VERY LITTLE POWER.  EACH TIME, I HAVE CALIBRATED TIME FOR SAFELY PULLING OUT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, EXPECTING TO HAVE NORMAL POWER.  SUDDENLY, I HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCELERATION AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY STALL OUT!  YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CLEAR ONCOMING TRAFFIC IN TIME.  THE LOW POWER CONTINUES FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, THEN RESUMES NORMAL OPERATION.  I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT NO ACCIDENT HAS OCCURRED, BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OVER TO THE SHOULDER.
