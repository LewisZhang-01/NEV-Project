The next day I fueled up the vehicle and when I attempted to start vehicle it misfired and I had to try starting it multiple times. I went to Auto zone to have the light read and was told error code P1450 was the reason for issues. I made an appointment with the Ford Delear I purchased the vehicle from.   The delear explained that the SUV\u2019s purge Cannister Valve was bad and that is why my engine was Misfiring after fueling up.  I was told the part would be here within 2 days. After about 4 days I was told no eta on parts and that the issue was with transportation on part but that it will be here soon.  I called a different Ford delearship in town and when they looked up my vin the explained that the part was recalled by Ford as it was faulty and they didn\u2019t know when it would be fixed.  I then attempted to take my car to a different mechanic shop and had them look at the aftermarket supply for the part and we were advised that Ford Motor Company has a nationwide shortage on this part and has a demand/priority with aftermarket manufacturers to suppply Ford\u2019s needs first and that no clue as to when this would happen as this is affecting all escape owners with this part issue. We also learned from inquiring with aftermarket part manufacturing that in just in the Northeast part of our state there are over 1100 Ford escapes waiting for the same part as well and that the shortage just happened recently as many Ford escapes recently reported having a bad Cannister Purge Valve. Looking at how this has progressed and how the engine misfires after fueling up due to faulty Cannister purge valve i am asking for an investigation into this issue since this is part of the vehicles emission system and can lead to engine issues due to misfires as we are not able to utilize the vehicle out of fear that it won\u2019t start or misfires potentially causing other system issues down the line.",

My car is now past the 60,000 mile warranty. I have looked at the NHSA Web sight that this seems to be a common problem. My out of pocket costs could be as much as $9,000 ,on a vehicle I bought 2 1/2 years ago for $17,000.",

It came back with sealant broke, coolant leaked into engine.  I need a new engine.  I am under the understanding this issue of coolant into engine was fixed back in 2020, with Ford's the Customer Satisfaction Program # 19B37. OF which I participated, but apparently, according to the Customer Satisfaction Program Customer Service person, the is nothing that can be done about it now.  According to several Technical Service Bulletins and SSM bulletins, Ford has known about this issue for a while now.  According to VehiclesHistory.com, NHTSA has a class action lawsuit concerning \"coolant into the engine\" against Ford.  So here is one more complaint.",

My car revved and no check engine light or warning indicator ever came on. The car finally jutted forward, so I pulled it off the side of the road and had it towed to a Ford dealership service center.   The dealership looked at the car and said I would need a whole new transmission and the parts are on back-order to which he also stated, \"which indicates to me this is a common problem with the 2017 Ford Escape.\"  I then towed the vehicle to a different Ford dealership service center to get a different opinion.

Since I need the vehicle for my transportation needs, I will be purchasing the new lug nuts as recommended, however, I will ask for the original lug nuts in question in the event there is an inspection request.   - How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? I do not feel at this time my safety has been put at risk.   - Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? This problem was identified by the dealer since the dealer is who recommended replacing the lug nuts.   - Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? The vehicle has not been inspected by anyone else or any other organization.   - Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?

The RPMs began to go all the way up, the drop all the way down repeatedly. Lights came on, and a red light came on saying something like \"Transmission malfunction Service now\". Thankfully, I was near an exit and was able to get off the interstate. I parked at a gas station and let my car sit for about 30 minutes. It immediately cranked back up, but would not drive. I called roadside assistance and had it towed to a nearby Ford dealership. Two days later, I was told I would need a new transmission due to the overdrive gear breaking apart and spreading metal throughout the transmission, rendering it basically useless. My car only has around 77,500 miles on it. In fact, I still have the original battery and tires. I have NEVER had any indication of a problem with the transmission - no noises, no lights, nothing. I take my car to my local dealership for oil changes and inspections when it is time. Not once have I ever been told there were any issues. I just feel this must have been a faulty part in order for it to simply break apart that fast to cause my car to stop working while I was driving, not to mention the fact it was able to ruin my entire transmission. I do not have any invoices to share at this time. I am still trying to come up with $6500 for the repair so I can get my car back. Thank. you for your time and consideration.",

The dealer had the gall to charge me $5/each for 20 new lug nuts that are just the same kind and will no doubt also have the same problem in a few years. Of course, I'll be replacing them soon with solid piece after market products.  1. Ford has been using these 2-piece lug nuts, knowing there is a problem for many years.  2. This vehicle was inspected at the dealer less than 3 months prior. They should have known to check this and replaced them at that time. They did not.  3. This wheel should not have been loose in the first place. The dealer was the last one with the wheels off during inspection and rotation. They did not even acknowledge that problem.  EVERY single FORD dealer -- but especially those in the Northeastern US where corrosive materials are applied to the road in winter -- should be inspecting these defective lug nuts every time they see the vehicle. Simple putting the right sized socket on each nut to see if it fits would have been sufficient. Ford should be replacing defective lug nuts at their expense.",

Googled and seen there had been similar issues with earlier models that resulted in a recall, but this is a 2017. Found some online suggestions and after an hour figured out where the fuel pump fuse was and removed it and the engine stopped. The dash still stayed lit up and had a warning to get engine serviced. Put key in ignition and turned to run not start position and vehicle cranked and tried to start. Could not get dash console to power down or look the doors, the horn would beep twice every time I tried to lock the doors. Ended up disconnecting the battery to kill the power to everything.

My problem with this is that i have to drive a vehicle  that could stall and get rear ended until they get back to me. This vehicle should have gotten new engine back in 3-15-2019 because that is the fix ford recommends. Their on hundreds of complaints for this same problem going back to 2010 with  the turbos.

June 7: Injectors replaced. Car started and car shook so badly that the tech and dealer refused to even take it out of the shop and said it would be a danger to take out on the road. More troubleshooting would be needed since they did not know what the issue was. June 8: Still unsure, but believe a total engine replacement may be needed but until further consultation with other experts and troubleshooting occurs, they will not give me a diagnosis.  They continue to assert that engine issue does make the car unsafe for highway use.",

I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE FORD DEALER I PURCHASED THE ESCAPE FROM FOR 10AM ON 06/15/2020.  AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF WAIT THE SERVICE TECH INFORMED ME THAT THE ENGINE BLOCK (AND AN ADDITIONAL 4 PAGES OF PARTS) WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  HE ALSO SAID SOME OF THESE PARTS ARE LIKELY TO BE BACK ORDERED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INCIDENCES OF THIS ISSUE/PROBLEM.  HE STATED THAT ONE SIDE OF THE ENGINE BLOCK WAS COOLING OFF FASTER THAN THE OTHER WHICH CAUSED THE ALUMINUM ENGINE BLOCK TO WARP AND IT IS ALLOWING COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE CYLINDER TUBES THAT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE ENGINE FAILURE.  WITH ONLY 27,381 MILES ON IT THESE REPAIRS ARE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIABILITY IN THE FUTURE AFTER WHAT'S BASICALLY AN ENGINE REBUILD.  WHAT MAKES ME ANGRY IS AFTER JUST A LITTLE RESEARCH I FIND THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS, BUT HAS FAILED TO ISSUE A RECALL OR AT THE VERY LEAST INFORM CURRENT OWNERS THAT THERE IS POTENTIALLY A SEVERE FLAW IN THEIR ENGINE DESIGN.  *TR",

I HAD TO DROP TO THE GROUND TO KEEP IT FROM CLOSING ON ME BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T STOP.  IT HURT TERRIBLY BUT I DIDN'T FEEL IT NECESSARY TO GO THE ER.  I CALLED FORD AND A REPORT WAS TAKEN AND I WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO TAKE IT IN AT THE TIME.  LAST WEEK, I WAS AGAIN AT THE GROCERY STORE AND A YOUNG MAN WAS LOADING MY GROCERIES WHILE I STOOD AND WATCHED.

WHEN I STARTED TO DRIVE IT THE NEXT DAY ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR THE FIRST TIME I APPLIED THE BRAKES AT A STOP SIGN.  THE BRAKES ENGAGED , BUT NOT VERY WELL.  THE PROBLEM DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER TRYING SEVERAL MORE BRAKE APPLICATIONS, OR BY PUMPING THE BRAKE PEDAL. THERE WAS NO INDICATION FROM THE CAR'S WARNING SYSTEMS THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKE SYSTEM.  THE FORD PASS APP ON MY PHONE DIDN'T REPORT ANY PROBLEM EITHER.  THE TOTAL LACK OF WARNING IS A REAL CONCERN.  THE PROBLEM DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER THE CAR WAS PARKED IN A WARMER GARAGE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM WAS A FAILED MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER.  THEY COULDN'T TELL ME WHAT CAUSED THE FAILURE OR WHAT FAILED.  THEY DID SAY THE FAULTY BRAKE CYLINDER WOULD BE SENT TO FORD FOR ANALYSIS.  THIS BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE IS A REAL CONCERN.  IN OVER 50 YEARS OF DRIVING I HAVE NEVER HAD A BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER FAIL ON A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILES.  WITHOUT KNOWING WHY IT FAILED I AM CONCERNED THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THE REPLACEMENT BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER.  NEXT TIME IT COULD HAPPEN AS I AM DRIVING THE CAR AT HIGHER SPEED, OR IN TRAFFIC RESULTING IN AN ACCIDENT.  THIS TYPE OF BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON ANY NEWER CAR, AND THE CAR'S WARNING SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ABLE LET YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH ANY PART OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM.",
