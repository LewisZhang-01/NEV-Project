I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK FROM HUBCO FORD IN ALLENTOWN PA.  IT HAS SINCE COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT HUBCO FORD, WHERE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE,  HAS CLOSED ITS DOORS AND NO LONGER CAN SERVICE THIS VEHICLE.  NOT ONLY WAS I NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE CLOSURE, BUT ALSO, THE CLOSEST SERVICE CENTER THAT CAN HANDLE THIS SIZE TRUCK, IS LOCATED IN ANOTHER STATE.  THIS REPAIR MAY ONLY REQUIRE LESS THAN HALF A DAY TO FIX, BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST THAT LONG OR BETTER GETTING THE TRUCK THERE AND BACK.  THIS HAS CREATED A HARDSHIP IN TRYING TO GET THIS VEHICLE REPAIRED.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS FORD''S RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS WHEN A DEALERSHIP HAS CLOSED ITS'' DOORS AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WITHIN A 100 MILE RANGE THAT NOT ONLY CAN''T REPAIR THIS VEHICLE, BUT THERE ARE NO DEALERSHIP TO HANDLE POSSIBLE FUTURE PURCHASES OF A VEHICLE LIKE THIS.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON FROM THIS AREA THAT IS NOW FACED WITH THIS PROBLEM.  I SINCERELY THINK THAT FORD CORPORATION NEEDS TO CONSIDER ITS CUSTOMERS NEEDS AND PROVIDE FOR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF REPAIRING THIS VEHICLE, WITHOUT CREATING SUCH HARDSHIP ON THE CUSTOMER.  *JB",
