I FOUND THIS OUT BY RESEARCHING ONLINE. THEY SURE ARE QUICK TO TAKE THE $1800+. GOOD MONEY MAKER DON'T YOU THINK. ALL I'M SAYING IS, IF IT NEEDS REPLACED THEN YES OF COURSE I'LL REPLACE IT AND I'LL TRY TO SOMEHOW FIND THE MONEY TO DO SO... BUT IF THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR YEARS ON THE RX350... WHY AM I AND MANY OTHERS COUGHING UP MONEY THAT I HONESTLY DONT HAVE !! TO REPLACE THE RACK AND PINION ?  I JUST CAME IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND 100,000 MILE OVERALL ROUTINE INSPECTION. STEERING FELT GOOD. NO LEAKS NOTED IN MY GARAGE FLOOR...OTHER THEN AC RESIDUAL FLUID WHICH OF COURSE IS NORMAL.",

I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL IN THE ENGINE AND THERE WAS NO OIL AT ALL.THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS ON THE DASH. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER AT MY OWN EXPENSE. THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE LEXUS DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE \"ENGINE OIL COOLER PIPE\" HAD BURST AND IT WOULD COST AROUND $500 FOR REPAIRS. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE DEFECT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE SERVICE. ON FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THE \"SB-10056509-3341\" SERVICE BULLETIN WHICH ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEFECT IN THE PART AND PROVIDED ENHANCED WARRANTY.

WE'VE OWNED 2 OTHER COROLLAS, ES250, CELICA, I'VE OWNED OTHER BRAND CARS TOO AND HAVE DRIVEN OVER 150K MILES AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE RACK AND PINION BOOT TEARING.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE RX, THE LAST TIME THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH A (MOTOR) OIL LINE BURSTING, THE OIL LINE THAT RUNS FROM THE OIL COOLER - THANK GOD NOTHING HAPPENED, THE CAR MADE IT HOME SAFELY HOME (BUT NO LOW OIL LIGHT CAME ON) AND WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE REPAIRS WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. WAS TOLD BY A MECHANIC THAT THE OIL LINE BURSTING WAS A COMMON PROBLEM, AND THAT THE NEWER RX MODELS THE PIPE WAS REPLACE WITH METAL PIPE.     IN MY OPINION ABOUT THE RACK AND PINION, IT'S DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE - THE STEERING OIL COULD POTENTIALLY LEAK ONTO THE EXHAUST AND CATCH FIRE, AND IF ALL THE POWER STEERING FLUID LEAKS OUT ONE MAY NOT REALIZE IT AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STEER THE CAR OUT OF HARMS WAY.    WE'VE OWNED SO MANY TOYOTA/LEXUS CARS AND WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN BELIEVER OF TOYOTA/LEXUS, BUT THIS RX HAS GOT ME WORRIED. I HOPE THAT THIS IS NOT A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME.  WILL BE THINKING REALLY HARD ABOUT TOYOTA/LEXUS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO BUY ANOTHER CAR.  *TR",

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AT AROUND 10:30 AM ON JULY 27, 2007 WHILE WE WERE TRAVELING NORTHBOUND ON I-95 IN FLORIDA.  WE WERE A SHORT DISTANCE NORTH OF EXIT 289 (WHERE WE ENTERED THE HIGHWAY) MOVING AT A NORMAL HIGHWAY RATE OF SPEED.  WE WERE TRAVELING IN THE RIGHT LANE.    SUDDENLY I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  I LOOKED TO SEE WHERE THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM (MY LEFT) AND FOUND THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW EXPANDED OUTWARD.  IT ALMOST APPEARED LIKE A BUBBLE THAT WAS BLOWING OUT FROM THE SIDE OF THE CAR.   THE GLASS THEN SHATTERED IN A SPIDER WEB FASHION THE GLASS BEGAN TO BREAK, FALLING BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR. ONCE STOPPED, I REALIZED THAT GLASS WAS COVERING ME FROM HEAD TO TOE.  THERE WERE SEVERAL CUTS AND SCRAPES ON MY ARMS AND LEGS FROM THE SHATTERED GLASS.  GLASS WAS IN MY HAIR, FELL DOWN MY NECK AND MANAGED TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO MY SHIRT.
