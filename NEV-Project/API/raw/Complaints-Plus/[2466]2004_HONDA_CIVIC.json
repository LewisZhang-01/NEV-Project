The driver suffered head injury (hematoma and cuts on scalp) & lumbar fracture and has to be treated in ER and was hospitalized for a few days. The injured driver also cannot go back to work until completely healed and still undergoing treatment. The car was moved from the towing service company shop to the storage facility of USAA (as of this writing, the vehicle is still there). In the police report, in the box for \"Airbag Deployed\", the officer encircled YES but did NOT specify it was for the passenger side ONLY.

I could have easily been hit by another car traveling at 70-80 miles per hour. Although glass shards hit me, I did not receive any personal injury. Stauffer Towing towed the vehicle to Caliber Collision. The windshield was replaced on Friday December 3rd by Caliber Collision in Salt Lake City. Caliber Collision also inspected the hood and related components. The hood will require replacement because the hinges were so badly damaged and I had to remove the hood so that this won't happen again. The hood latch had released and I later noticed that the metal supporting the latch is also having issues. The latch has been giving problems with opening and closing properly at times.",

I CALLED DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT, WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WAS NOT PART OF THAT RECALL. I WAS PART OF A MASS DUMPING FROM HONDA FOR CARS FROM 2000-2004.  I THEN TOLD THEM THAT MY SRS LIGHT WAS COMING ON AND OFF, WAS ADVISED TO BRING INTO SERVICE DEPT.  I DID. WHILE BEING SERVICED, TECHNICIANS SCANNED VEHICLE & CHECKED FOR CODES (WHICH WAS $95) - NO CODES WERE FOUND. THEY THEN RAN A DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLESHOOT, WHICH INDICATED THAT SRS CONTROL UNIT NEEDED REPLACED AND THEN RECHECK. WAS TOLD THAT WOULD BE $495, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PART AND WOULD HAVE TO ORDER IT. WAS ALSO TOLD, THEY WERE NOT EVEN  SURE IF THAT WOULD BE MY SOLUTION. WHEN I ASKED THEM WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS CONTROL UNIT (FOR AIRBAG SAFETY FEATURE), TO NEED REPLACED. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY \"WERE UNSURE AND MAYBE A SHORT CAUSED IT.  IT IS AN ELECTRICAL UNIT AND MANY THINGS COULD GO WRONG.\"  WHEN I ASKED WHAT COULD CAUSE A SHORT, WAS TOLD, 'NOT SURE, COULD BE WETNESS OR AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION.\" (WET INSIDE MY CAR, I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.)  I THEN STATED, THAT THIS SOUNDED LIKE A MANUFACTURES DEFECT TO THE UNIT. I WAS TOLD OTHERWISE. I ASKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SRS LIGHT IS ON, TOLD THAT THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT BE ACTIVE AND NOT DEPLOY IF IN ACCIDENT. WHY IS THERE NO LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THE AIRBAG SAFETY FEATURE & SYSTEM, (WHICH IS ON ALL CARS TODAY), LIKE THERE IS FOR THE SEAT BELT MECHANISM & SYSTEM?

SO ON SEPT 10TH I CALLED THE SALES MANAGER IN VA AND TOLD HIM THE CAR WAS GIVING ME PROBLEMS. ON SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 11TH I WAS GOING TO MAKE A TRIP TO SEE THE SALES MANAGER IN PERSON WHEN MY CAR QUIT WORKING WHEN I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A TURN INTO THE BP GAS STATION IN MD. MY MOTHER HAD TO PICK ME, WE THEN WENT TO THE VA DEALERSHIP AND THEY SENT A TOW TRUCK TO GET THE CAR ON THEIR ACCOUNT. NOW AFTER 4 DAYS OF WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE CAR, THE GENERAL MANAGER FROM THE VA DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WAS ALL MY FAULT, BASICALLY INSULTED ME AS A WOMAN SAYING THAT I SHOULD BE MORE EXPERIENCED,THAT I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE WHICH I HAD UNTIL THEIR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTANT TOLD ME 3  WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR THAT THE BANK COULDN'T FINANCE THE CAR FOR THE WHOLE AMOUNT FINANCED. SO I  SAID I JUST BOUGHT THAT CAR AND I HAVE ONLY MADE 3 CAR PAYMENTS. SO I FOUND OUT LATER THROUGH MY MECHANIC FRIEND THAT THE IMA BATTERY WAS ON IT'S LAST LEG AND THEY PROBABLY PUT A BAND-AID ON A GASH WHICH WAS THE LITHIUM BATTERY WHICH IS THE LIFE-FORCE OF THE CAR.  THE COST IS 3450 HE TELLS ME. SO I ASKED THE GENERAL MANAGER IF YOU WEREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE VEHICLE WHY DID YOU TOW MY CAR FROM OXON HILL,MD TO ALEXANDRIA,VA. HE HAD NO RESPONSE AND WENT ON TO SAY IF I WANTED THE CAR FIXED IT WOULD COME OF MY OWN POCKET AND THAT WAS THAT. I HAVE JUST PAID 550 FOR A USED IMA HYBRID BATTERY PACK AND MY MECHANIC FRIEND IF GOING TO INSTALL FOR ME. THE OLD IMA BATTERY WAS WORN OUT,RUSTED, THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS OCCURRED WAS EVERY DAY SINCE INCIDENT DATE, STILL NOT FIXED YET. *TR",

LIGHTS ON DASH WOULD GO OUT AND INTERMITTENTLY WORK OR FLASH ALL LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY (ALONG WITH RADIO, HEATER, ETC), POWER STEERING SUDDENLY WENT OUT MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO STEER, THEN WOULD COME ON FOR A SECOND OR TWO, CAUSING THE CAR TO SWERVE. BRAKES WORKED INTERMITTENTLY. WHILE NOT WORKING I PUSHED THE BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD WITH ONLY MINIMAL SLOWING - IT FELT LIKE THE ANTI-LOCK MECHANISM WAS ENGAGED. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH 2 MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP, SO I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE DEALERSHIP. ONCE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR AT 20 MPH FOR THE 2 MILES.  2) ONE TIME WHEN BATTERY RAN OUT OF CHARGE.  3) I GOT TO THE DEALER - THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY AND EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY WORKED AS NORMAL. THE DEALER WAS SKEPTICAL THAT THE PROBLEM WAS SERIOUS AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE WHERE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH HONDA. WHEN I HAVE ASKED ABOUT THIS THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT SOMETHING ELSE MUST HAVE CAUSED IT AND DIAGNOSTICS WOULD BE REQUIRED. BUT OVER THE PAST YEAR IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN, AND 70,000 MILE CHECKUP DID NOT SHOW ANY PROBLEMS.    IT APPEARS THAT THE BATTERY IS SOMEHOW LINKED WITH THE HYBRID BATTERY SYSTEM, SUCH THAT LOOSING BATTERY POWER DOES NOT JUST KEEP THE CAR FROM STARTING, BUT SHORTS OUT ALL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, THEN PERHAPS COMES BACK ON AS A SMALL AMOUNT OF CHARGE IS REPLACED TO THE BATTERY?    I ADDED AN AFTERMARKET STEREO, ALL REST OF ELECTRICAL IS HONDA. IF NO OTHER COMPLAINTS EXIST PERHAPS THIS IS THE CAUSE, THOUGH IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY. *TR",

MAYBE YOU SHOULD VERIFY THAT THE PROBLEM IS FIXED IN THERE NEWER CVT'S OTHERWISE DEATHS MAY OR WILL OCCUR.  THE VEHICLE IS A 2004 HONDA CIVIC HYBRID, SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET THERE IS THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE CVT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  IF THE REFUSE TO FIX OR FAIL TO FIX, THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND BE FORCED TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE TRANSMISSIONS. *TR",

BUT, I DID NOT COMPLAIN TO THEM, AS I REALLY DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE. (THEY HAD QUOTED ME FOR A FULL SERVICE, AND THEN CALLED ME AT WORK TO SAY THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE CABIN FILTER, SO ADDED ANOTHER $80... TOTAL TO WELL OVER $500.) I KNEW IF I WENT IN WITH A PROBLEM THEY WOULD TAKE ME FOR A RIDE AGAIN.  ANYWAY THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY AFTER I ADDED STP FUEL CLEANER A COUPLE OF TIMES INTO A FULL TANK. WALL MART HAS THESE FOR ABOUT $2.50 FOR THREE SMALL BOTTLES, EACH WORK A SINGLE CLEAN.    I LOVE MY HONDA. NOTHING MUCH WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. IT IS JUST A GOOD NATURED CAR, OTHER THAN WHEN TRYING TO BREAK GENTLY AT VERY LOW SPEED, AS IT HAS A TENDENCY TO JUMP.  AT LOW SPEEDS, I NOW GIVE MY SELF SPACE AND I BREAK WITH REGULAR PRESSURE.    FIRST, ALL CARS WILL HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. NOTHING MECHANICAL CAN BE PERFECT. SO BE AWARE OF THIS WHEN SERVICING A CAR.    SECONDLY, THE PROBLEM IS MAINLY WITH DEALERS. HONDA OUGHT TO CRACK DOWN ON THESE CROOKS BY HAVING SET RULES POSTED ON DOORS OF DEALERSHIPS OVER PRICING, WHAT OUGHT TO BE IN A SERVICE, WHEN THE REGULAR SERVICE IS, ETC.    EVEN AFTER THE FUEL AFFAIR WAS DONE WITH, I NOW WATCH HOW MANY MILES I DRIVE AND FILL IT EVERY 250 MILES OR SO. THAT WAY IT CAN NEVER RUN OUT OF GAS. A FEW DAYS AGO I FILLED IT UP AFTER 246 MILES. IT ONLY NEEDED 6.5 GALLONS TO TOP IT UP! YES, THAT IS OVER 39 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY MOSTLY @ 65 MPH.    WE AS CONSUMER SHOULD COMPLAIN. WE NEED HONDA TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH STANDARDS. IF HONEST PEOPLE SELL CARS FOR HONDA, THE IMAGE IS THAT MUCH BETTER.    HONDA OUGHT TO WATCH OUT. I HAVE DRIVEN CARS FROM THE COMPETITION THAT IS BETTER AND BETTER. THEY ARE A MAJOR ENGINE AWAY FROM CATCHING UP, BUT IN THE AREA OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY ARE PASSING HONDA.  *TR",

DURING THIS TIME I HAD WRITTEN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY HAD ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT AND HOW IT WAS MY FAULT, NOT AN ACTUAL PROBLEM.  THE NEXT WEEK I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALER WHO RIGHT AWAY FOUND THERE WAS A PROBLEM. WHEN THEY CALLED HONDA TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO SINCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS THEY WERE TOLD NOT TO DO ANYTHING. THEY ADVISED I COME BACK AND MEET WITH THE HONDA REP.  I DID AND THEY TRIED RUNNING TESTS, CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE AND EVERYTHING CAME UP OK. SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED IT COULD BE AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM.
