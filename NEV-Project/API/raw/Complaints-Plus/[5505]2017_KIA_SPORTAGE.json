        "summary": "On November 2020 I bought my 2017 Kia Sportage 4DR FWD LX. I been having issues with the  driver's and passenger windows since 05/08/2021. The driver's window will not go down, Deland Kia Dealer inspection said the rubber window channel for the driver's windows needed to be lubricated and it got fix. Now 8 months later the same situation is happening again on the the same window, the window will not go down, and the motor works because you can hear it running. On 10/18/2021 I had to get my kia Sportage for service due the right (passenger) window not going up, it was stock and will not go up at all, again the motor was working because you can heart running. I got my Kia serviced at Deland Kia and they changed the window regulator gear panel. Is working (for now) but now my left rear window will not go up and is sliding down, like it loose and the drive's windows also having the same problem. I believe all this issues are a safety concern due to; first what if that window that is sliding will break and cut someone, plus is an easy way for someone to brake into my vehicle. Also the windows not coming down, what if I had an accident and the only way to get me out will be breaking the window because it will not go down and if there was a gas leak or something I will get trap there. I looked online to multiple vehicle forums and there is multiple complains about this window issue, some believe is due to a regulator wheel malfunction or a complete regulator malfunction. At this point almost all my windows had an issue which is putting my safety and my family safety on risk.",

Since then, we have done 3 oil comsumption tested which \"just passed\" the criteria.  I burn enough oil that I have a soot deposit in my exhaust pipe.  My car is at 81,000 miles and has lost enough oil from the last oil change (4,000 miles ago - scheduled oil change for December 15) that there is no oil indication on the dipstick.  The dealer has asked me to not add oil because it is 2 quarts low and ok to drive.   They have said the warranty only covers if the consumption is greater than 1 quart per 1000 miles and this much oil loss is normal.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL and indicates a defect in the piston rings, which would be a warranty repair that is being denied.",

They were suppose to call me when they received the part and never did call me back. I recently had my A/C repaired last week at Folsom Lake Kia in Folsom CA and asked them if they could repair the recall issue as well. They had my car since last week and provided me a rental on friday, 6/4. Today on 6/8, I am told my A/C is fixed and no part for the recall so I had to pick up my car and return the rental. I have a newborn baby and this recall is extremely dangerous and its not safe. I should not have to pay for a rental when the recall is dangerous and not at fault of mine. This is ridiculous and all dealerships should provide rental cars when a recall is very serious with the part(s) being unavailable.",

THIS HAS HAPPENED ON STRAIGHT ROADS, HIGHWAYS, AND WHILE TURNING AT A VARIETY OF SPEEDS IE: FROM 15-70 MPH. I CANNOT PREDICT NOR CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN. SOMETIMES I DRIVE FOR WEEKS BEFORE IT HAPPENS, THEN IT CAN HAPPEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE SAME DAY, SAME DRIVE. THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED 5 TIMES IN ONE HOUR. I'M CONCERNED THAT I MIGHT GET REAR ENDED BY SOMEONE NOT NOTICING THAT I'M DECELERATING WITHOUT BRAKING. NO ERROR CODES APPEAR. KIA SERVICE CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. I HAVE A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LEFT ON MY LEASE AND JUST UNDER 21,000 MILES. THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR OVER A YEAR. KIA SERVICE BEING VERY PATRONIZING ABOUT THE PROBLEM!",

WHAT MAKES THIS EVEN MORE UNSAFE IS THE SIGNALS WRAP AROUND THE BUMPER, SO THAT OF THE 7 7/8\" OF LAMP, ONLY 2 1/2\" SHOW IN THE REAR. THE REST OF THE SIGNAL LAMP AREA IS ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND NOT VISIBLE TO CARS BEHIND ME. (PLEASE SEE UPLOADED PHOTOS.)

AFTER BEING NOTIFIED BY MANY DRIVERS OF MY SMALL, OUT-OF-PLACE AND INCONSPICUOUS TURN SIGNALS, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, THINKING THAT THE CIRCUIT TO THE BRAKE LIGHTS WAS FAULTY, SINCE THE BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T BLINK TO SIGNAL A TURN.
