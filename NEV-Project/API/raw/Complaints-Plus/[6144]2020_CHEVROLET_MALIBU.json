The power steering will also intermittently fail, as it becomes difficult to turn the wheel during these times. The car will also not accelerate at my will like it should at this time. Check engine lights will show up, as well as other warning notifications on the dash board. Some of the warnings include \"Service Power Steering. Drive with Care\", \"Fuel Level Low\", and \"Service ESC\". The car will also intermittently show all gauges in the zero/off/empty position.
