I RECENTLY ALMOST HAD A POTENTIAL FIRE CAUSED BY MY RV REFRIGERATOR ON JUNE 13, 2014 WHEN I DISCONNECTED THE CAMPSITE 110 VOLT AC POWER FROM MY POP-UP TRAILER WHILE PACKING/CLOSING THE POP-UP FOR TOWING.  THE 110V/12V/LP GAS REFRIGERATOR IS DESIGN AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHED FROM 110V TO 12 VOLT / LP GAS  IN THE AUTO POSITION.  THE REFRIGERATOR IS \"LOOKING\" FOR THE BEST POWER SOURCE AVAILABLE IN THE AUTO MODE.  IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNED THE LP GAS FUNCTION \"ON\" WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.  THIS IS A CONCERN SINCE REFRIGERATOR VENTING WOULD BE COVERED BY THE TWO ROOF SECTIONS IF FOLDED DOWN, WITH NO WHERE FOR THE HOT COMBUSTION GASES TO GO BUT INSIDE THE RV CABIN.  LUCKILY I FELT THE HEAT FROM THE REFRIGERATOR VENTING WHEN I WAS DISCONNECTING / PACKING UP THE CABLE TV CONNECTION.  CABLES AND ITEMS REQUIRING STORAGE MUST BE PACKED UP IN THE REAR STORAGE AREA BEFORE THE UPPER TWO ROOF SECTIONS ARE LOWERED.  WITH THE SLIDE-OUT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO TURN OF THE LP GAS VALVES.   IF I TURNED OFF THE GAS, THEIR WOULD STILL BE RESIDUAL GAS PRESSURE IN THE LINES TO OPERATE THE REFRIGERATOR IN LP GAS MODE. WITHOUT A SAFETY CONTROL, THE USER MUST INSURE THAT THE REFRIGERATOR IS IN THE OFF POSITION BEFORE STARTING TO DO ANY CLOSE DOWN ACTIVITIES .  AS A RESULT OF THIS, I AM HAVING A SAFETY CONTROL SYSTEM INSTALLED IN MY RV THAT PREVENTS THE REFRIGERATOR BURNER FROM OPERATING AUTOMATICALLY.  *TR",

INSTALLATION OF THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS MANUAL.   THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE WAS THE FRONT CHALK (PAGE 3 FIGURE 2) MISSING WHEN I STOPPED.  PHYSICS DICTATES THE 87LBS OF WATER/UNIT TO CONTINUE TO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS THE RV SLOWS DOWN.  ACCELERATION DID NOT AFFECT THE UNIT DUE TO THE REAR MISSING CHALK, BECAUSE IT WAS TIGHTLY AGAINST THE CABINET AND THE WATER/UNIT HAD RESISTANCE.  THE MOUNTING STRUCTURE (PAGE 2 FIGURE 1) IS SECONDARY BUT CRITICAL TAKING LESS G-FORCE (MAKING TURNS).   ALSO, THE 11 SCREWS THAT THEY DID USE FLUSH DOOR FRAME WERE JUST IN A THIN PEACE OF ALUMINUM RV SKIN WITH FOAM INSIDE.  I AM SURPRISED THAT I AM THE FIRST TO REPORT IT.  TRAILMANOR'S SOLUTION TO MY COMPLAINT/DAMAGE IN APRIL 2014 WAS TO JUST INSTALL THE MOUNTING STRUCTURE (PAGE 2 FIGURE 1), IN A MODIFIED CONFIGURATION WHERE THE MOUNTING STRUCTURE IS IN THE WALL, BUT PUTS TOO MUCH TORQUE ON THE WALL STRUCTURE AND POTENTIALLY DAMAGING IT AGAIN AND STILL UNSAFE.  AFTER PERSISTENCE TO GET THE CHALKS (PAGE 3 FIGURE 2) INSTALLED IN JUNE 11,2014.  TRAILMANOR STATED THAT BOTH WILL BE PART OF ALL FUTURE INSTALLATIONS.
