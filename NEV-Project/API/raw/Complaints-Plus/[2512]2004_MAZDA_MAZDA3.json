I EVEN SHOWED THEM A VIDEO I HAD TAKEN OF THIS HAPPENING IN MY CAR ONE NIGHT AS I DROVE AROUND MY BLOCK IN ORDER TO DOCUMENT THE ISSUE. THERE IS NO PATTERN WITH REGARDS TO SPEED OF VEHICLE, OR WHETHER THE ENGINE IS COLD OR HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR A WHILE, AS THE ISSUE CAN HAPPEN REGARDLESS OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS.  *TR",

I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL CARS IN THE PAST AND HAVE ONLY REPLACED THE REAR BRAKES A FEW TIMES WHILE I HAVE REPLACED THE FRONT SEVERAL TIMES.    WHEN CONTACTING 3 DIFFERENT MAZDA DEALERSHIPS I WAS TOLD IT IS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR AND  I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE BACK BREAKS AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING FOR THE FRONT SINCE THEY DO NOT SEE A PROBLEM.  THIS CAR HAS FAILED TO ENGAGE THE ABS 2 TIMES, LUCKILY THE OTHER DRIVER WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AROUND ME AND MISS ME.  IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I WILL HAVE AN ACCIDENT DUE TO MY BRAKES FAILING TO ENGAGE ON THE FRONT!  THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY MAZDA IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT!  *TR",

THE CAR HAS BEEN RUSTPROOFED BY KROWN SINCE IT'S FIRST YEAR, IS WASHED AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK (MORE OFTEN IN WINTER MONTHS), AND IS OTHERWISE VERY WELL MAINTAINED.  CURRENTLY I AM HAVING TO DEAL WITH A MAJOR RUST ISSUE WHICH, FROM READING MAZDA FORUM ENTRIES, IS PROVING TO BE EXTREMELY COMMON IN MY YEAR AND MAKE OF CAR.  FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN COMPLETE RUSTING ON THE INSIDE OF THE REAR WHEEL WELLS WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED TO MY DEALERSHIP, TO NO AVAIL.  NOW I ALSO HAVE RUSTING AT THE BOTTOM OF BOTH REAR PASSENGER DOORS, AND AT THE SEAMS BY THE BUMPER.  ASIDE FROM THAT ISSUE, THE PAINT ON ALL 4 DOORS AND ON THE LIFTGATE (IT IS A HATCHBACK) IS BLISTERING!  I DID BRING MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT WAS FLATLY TOLD THAT THERE IS ONLY A \"PERFORATION\" WARRANTY WHICH ONLY PERTAINS TO ACTUAL HOLES.  MAZDA CANADA IS THEREFORE UNWILLING TO HELP DEFRAY ANY PART OF THE CONSIDERABLE REPAIR BILL.  I BROUGHT MY CAR IN TO 3 SHOPS TO GET REPAIR ESTIMATES WHICH RANGE IN COST FROM $1000 TO FIX JUST THE OBVIOUS RUST SPOTS TO $1800 TO ALSO ADDRESS ALL THE BLISTERING.  BASICALLY MOST OF THE CAR, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF THE FRONT HOOD (WHICH I HAD COVERED IN CLEAR COATING WHEN I GOT IT) AND THE ROOF, NEEDS TO BE SANDBLASTED AND COMPLETELY REFINISHED TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE.  ALL SHOPS I'VE SPOKEN TO FIND THIS RUSTING/BLISTERING ISSUE ON A 2004 WELL-MAINTAINED CAR TO BE VERY UNUSUAL AND ATTRIBUTE IT TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  ONE PLACE EVEN MENTIONED THAT HE RECENTLY REFINISHED TWO OTHER MAZDA 3S IN THE SAME COLOR AS MINE (WINNING BLUE).    SINCE THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE WITH THE ORIGINAL PAINTING OF THE CARS, MAZDA CANADA SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AND OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS SOME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE.  ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PAINT REPAIRS ARE QUITE COSTLY, THE COMPANY SHOULD TAKE THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY.  AS IS, MY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN BRUSHED OFF AND IGNORED.  *TR",

HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE ONE TIRE AND THE DEALER DID NOT CHECK THE OTHER 3 TIRES WHICH WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO ANOTHER DEALER WHO SHOWED ME THE SEPARATING SIDEWALLS AND TOLD ME THAT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED.

ON DECEMBER 27, 2005 - THE OIL FILTER HOUSING CARTRIDGE ON MY 2004 MAZDA3 BASICALLY FRACTURED AND ALL OF THE OIL WAS RUN OUT OF THE CAR, AND THEN THE ENGINE SEIZED.  MY CAR HAD APPROXIMATELY 54,000 MILES, AND 5 OIL CHANGES, ALL WITH SYNTHETIC OIL.     I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO TOM BUSH MAZDA, WHERE THEY VOLUNTEERED TO DO SOME RESEARCH TO SEE IF THEY COULD DETERMINE THE CAUSE, AND THEN PERHAPS ASK MAZDA FOR \"GOODWILL\" ON THE CAR ITSELF.       ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 3RD, I WENT INTO THE MAZDA DEALER, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE \"OIL FILTER HOUSING CARTRIDGE\" HAD BEEN CRACKED BY FAULTY WORKMANSHIP AT ONE OF THE OIL CHANGE LOCATIONS THAT HAD CHANGED THE OIL.  UPON DOING FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT MAZDA CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THE ENGINE TO NO LONGER USE THE PLASTIC CARTRIDGE HOUSING, BUT WENT TO A CANISTER FILTER, AND ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN TO ALL OF THEIR LOCATIONS THAT SEVERE DAMAGE COULD RESULT IF THE PROPER TOOL WAS NOT USED TO REMOVE THE CARTRIDGE.  THEY NO LONGER USE THIS DESIGN.  THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS VIA WEB SEARCH OF SIMILAR FAILURES OCCURRING TO THIS FAULTY DESIGN FEATURE.     IT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT I HAD THE OIL CHANGED AT TOM BUSH MAZDA PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THEIR SERVICE BULLETIN - IT ADDS MORE CONFUSION TO WHO MAY BE CULPABLE FOR THE PROBLEM.     I AM TRYING TO BE RATIONAL ABOUT THE ISSUE, AND AM FINDING THAT MAZDA WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE CHANGE IN DESIGN OR ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE DEFECT OF THE PRODUCT/DESIGN. THE OIL LOSS IN QUESTION WAS CATASTROPHIC - NOT A MINOR LEAK, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE ENGINE EMPTIED IN 30 OR LESS SECONDS.     I HAVE CONTACTED THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, MICHAEL VON BALSOM, AT 904-731-4010, AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RETURN PHONE CALLS, HAVE REQUESTED AN ESTIMATE OF REPAIRS FROM TOM BUSH MAZDA FROM PAM BUSBY, AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE.  *NM",

(2) IN APRIL OF 2005, I TURNED THE KEY TO START THE CAR. IT HESITATED FOR OVER 10 SECONDS AND FINALLY TURNED OVER. I WAS ALARMED, AND AFTER A FEW MORE TIMES OF THIS HAPPENING, I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY.  (3) IT WAS DECIDED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP. I RECEIVED A NEW FUEL PUMP (UNDER WARRANTY) AND AFTER A WEEK, IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN, AND MY CAR WENT BACK INTO THE SHOP. THEY CLEANED THE BATTERY, AND ALL OF THE CONNECTIONS, RULING OUT A POSSIBLE ELECTRIC PROBLEM. IT WAS OKAY, THEN IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN. I HAD IT IN FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE FUEL PUMP THEY USED TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MUST HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME POOR QUALITY, SO FUEL PUMP #3 WENT IN. WELL, WHEN I STARTED THE CAR TO DRIVE IT OUT OF THE SERVICE LOT, IT HESITATED AGAIN! I SAT IN MY CAR AND CRIED. I WENT RIGHT BACK INTO THE SERVICE DEPT., AND ASKED THEM TO TAKE CARE OF IT.THEY SAID SINCE IT RAN FINE, IT WAS ONLY THE STARTING ISSUE, IT WAS OKAY TO DRIVE 700 MILES ROUND TRIP TO MASSACHUSETTS (MY PREVIOUSLY PLANNED WEEKEND TRIP) AND THEY'D SEE ME WHEN I RETURNED. WELL, IT SURVIVED THE DRIVE, AND I HAD THE CHANCE TO REFILL THE FUEL TANK 3 WHOLE TIMES WITH 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAS THAN I NORMALLY USE. IT STILL HESITIATED A LOT, BUT WAS ACTING THE SAME. I DROVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE SHOP THAT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AFTER I RETURNED TO PA, AND JUST RECEIVED A CALL TODAY THAT THE TECHNICIAN FROM JAPAN WAS LOOKING AT IT, AND DECIDED IT NEEDED A NEW FUEL PUMP. YES, FUEL PUMP #4! I AM BEYOND FED UP WITH THIS CAR, AND I AM CONTACTING THE PA LEMON LAW ATTORNEYS TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY CAR IS OVER 12 MONTHS AND 12,000 MILES OLD.  (P.S. I AM ALSO EXPERIENCING THE ROTOR WEAR PROBLEMS, BUT I'M TAKING CARE OF ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME.  MAYBE MAZDA WILL BUY THIS SUCKER BACK!)  *TR",

THEN TWO WEEKS AGO WE WERE DRIVING THE CAR MY HUSBAND HAD IT IN NETTURAL AT A LIGHT AND PLACED IN MANUAMATIC THEN DIRECTLY IN DRIVE AND THE CAR MADE A LOUD SOUND THAT MADE US WONDER IF THE TRANSMISSION HAD FELL OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  AGAIN WE BROUGHT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE IT AND DECIDED TO REPLACE A DRIVE MECHANISM THAT DEALS WITH THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTING OF THE VEHICLE.

THE CAR HAS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. *AK    PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: AFTER APROXIMATELY 1800 MILES OF DRIVING (CITY/HIGHWAY), I BEGAN TO NOTICE SLIGHT DISCOLORED BANDS ON EACH OF THE BRAKE ROTOR DISCS AT ALL FOUR WHEELS.  AFTER ANOTHER 600 MILES OF DRIVING, I BEGAN TO NOTICE GROOVING IN THE PLACES WITH THE DISCOLORED BANDS.  AT THIS POINT, THE GROOVE COULD BE FELT BY A FINGERTIP.    THE GROOVES ARE VISIBLE ON THE OUTWARD SIDE OF EACH ROTOR.  I HAVE NOT INSPECTED THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF EACH ROTOR (THE SIDE THAT WOULD BE CLOSEST TO THE VECHICLE CHASSIS) TO VERIFY GROOVING ON EITHER SIDE.    EFFORTS TO CORRECT: I HAVE REQUESTED THAT MY DEALERSHIP INSPECT THE BRAKES, AND THEY HAVE ALSO NOTED THE GROOVING.  HOWEVER, THEY CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO FIX FOR THIS OTHER THAN RE-SURFACING EACH ROTOR.  THIS WILL PREMATURELY WEAR MY BRAKING COMPONENTS, SO I DECLINED THIS OFFER.  ALSO, SIMPLY RESURFACING THE BRAKE ROTORS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHAT IS CAUSING THE GROOVING IN THE FIRST PLACE.    OUTCOME: BRAKING POWER AND STABILITY REMAIN UNAFFECTED IN SPITE OF THE GROOVES.  HOWEVER, THE LONGEVITY OF THE BRAKES IS DIMINISHED. I AM UNCERTAIN WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE WITH CONTINUED GROOVING.  THIS IS A FORESHADOWING TO PREMATURE BRAKE COMPONENT FAILURE.",
