APPROXIMATELY 5 YEARS AFTER THE PURCHASE, IN OUR HOT SUMMERS, I NOTICED THE DIGITAL DASHBOARD (ONE OF THE FEATURES THAT ATTRACTED MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF TO THIS PARTICULAR CAR) STARTED SHOWING HORIZONTAL \"STREAKS\" ACROSS THE LIGHT PANEL & THE READINGS WOULD FLICKER IN AND OUT. AS THE YEARS PASSED, THE PROBLEM GREW WORSE, TO THE POINT WHERE THE LIGHTS WOULD ACTUALLY GO OUT COMPLETELY! WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST STARTED, APPROXIMATELY 1994, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS PURCHASED FROM AND WAS INFORMED THAT, YES, THEY HAD DISCONTINUED USING THESE DIGITAL LIGHTS JUST FOR THAT REASON! UPON INQUIRY TO REPAIR, I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WOULD COST ROUGHLY (AT THAT TIME) $1200 - $1400 TO INSTALL THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS REQUIRED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM!!! I HAD THEM SOMETIMES. I AM STILL DRIVING THE CAR AFTER 15 YRS., I NEVER HAVE ANY OF MY DASH LIGHTS - NOT SPEED, OIL, GAS, MILEAGE, CHECK ENGINE, CRUISE CONTROL OR TEMPERATURE; OR ANY OTHER READINGS I'VE LONG FORGOTTEN HAD BEEN THERE. OBVIOUSLY, SPEED AND MY GAS GAUGE ARE THE TWO THINGS I CONSIDER MISSING THE MOST. I CAN KEEP UP WITH THE GAS, I'VE ONLY RUN OUT ONCE, TO MY CREDIT. THE SPEED, HOWEVER, I FEEL IS DANGEROUS. PERHAPS NISSAN DOES NOT CARE IF I GET A TICKET OR TWO FOR BEING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT, SO PERHAPS THAT DANGER IS PERCEIVED AS \"ONLY TO ME\", AFTERALL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE BRAKES OR TRANSMISSION. I DO NOT AGREE. I HAVE FELT, FROM THE BEGINNING, THAT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS NISSAN'S RESPONSIBILITY.  I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER 1989 MAXIMAS ON THE ROAD WITH NO DASH LIGHTS. I HAVE BEEN \"IN THE DARK\" FOR ABOUT 8 YRS. NOW AND I DO FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS FORUM TO EXPLAIN THIS CAR'S PROBLEM, I DID WRITE TO NISSAN CORP.
