        "summary": "MY 2009 BMW Z4 WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AT ABOUT A 65 ANGLE TO THE REAR OF MY TOYOTA PICKUP TRUCK.  I GOT INTO THE BMW INTENDING MOVE IT INTO THE GARAGE.  THE CAR HAS A STANDARD TRANSMISSION AND WAS IN FIRST GEAR WITH THE PARKING BRAKE ON.  I DEPRESSED THE CLUTCH PEDAL AND STARTED THE ENGINE.  AN INSTANT AFTER THE PARKING BRAKE RELEASED, THE RUBBER CLUTCH PEDAL COVER SLIPPED OFF THE CLUTCH PEDAL TAKING MY FOOT WITH IT.  THE BMW SHOT FORWARD.  THE FRONT RIGHT FENDER OF THE BMW STRUCK THE LEFT REAR BUMPER OF THE TOYOTA PICKUP TRUCK STALLING THE ENGINE OF THE BMW.  THE RESULTING DAMAGE TO THE BMW IS APPROXIMATELY $5000.00 AND THE DAMAGE TO THE TOYOTA PICKUP TRUCK IS APPROXIMATELY $550.00.    TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2009, I TOOK THE BMW INTO THE AUSTIN BMW DEALER.  THE RUBBER PEDAL COVER WAS REATTACHED WITH 'SUPERGLUE' AND I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP.    TWO DAYS LATER I TOOK THE BMW TO A BODY SHOP.  WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I FELT THE RUBBER CLUTCH PEDAL COVER BEGIN TO 'SLIP' AS I DROVE UP MY DRIVEWAY.  THE NEXT DAY I AGAIN TOOK THE CAR INTO THE BMW DEALER.  THE RUBBER PEDAL COVER WAS 'LOOSE' BUT DID NOT COME COMPLETELY OFF.  I TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND SCHEDULED A CONFERENCE WITH THE BMW FACTORY REP AT HIS NEXT VISIT.  ON WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21ST I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR EXAMINATION BY THE FACTORY REP.  WHEN THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME THE CLUTCH PEDAL HAD BEEN REATTACHED.  I WAS TOLD THE FACTORY REP WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  'SCOTT' FROM BMW HEADQUARTERS (NEW JERSEY?) CALLED ME ON NOVEMBER 4, 2009 AND TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD MANUFACTURED 10,000 OF THIS MODEL AND HAD RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF CLUTCH PEDAL COVERS COMING OFF.     I BELIEVE THE RUBBER CLUTCH PEDAL CURRENTLY IN THE VEHICLE IS THE ORIGINAL.  THE DEALER PROVIDED ME WITH A CUSTOMER COPY OF THE WORK ORDER ON MY FIRST VISIT.  THE DEALER DID NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION ON MY SUBSEQUENT TWO VISITS. *TR",
