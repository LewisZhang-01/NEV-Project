I veered off the interstate, onto the shoulder, with the tractor trailer barely missing me.  My 11 year old son was also with me.  After that, I\u2019d occasionally have issues with my car not wanting to accelerate at all.  I got stuck a few times in the roadway, until it would suddenly work again 20-30 minutes later after sitting. My next long trip was a 3 hour trip from home several months later.  My transmission died, while driving, at about 45mph.  I couldn\u2019t make it back home and had to have it towed.  It was replaced, and I\u2019m having new issues now, which I\u2019ll put in a second report.  What are your children worth to you?

I couldn\u2019t keep my car speed up in evening traffic, at 65mph, and my RPM\u2019s began to jump back and forth, never steadying. My car jerked so badly I was struggling to control it and several cars had to pass me, going into the lane to the left of me. I had to drive it one more day, tonight, and after 60 minutes of driving, at 70mph on the interstate, when 3/4 of the way home, it began violently jerking again and RPM\u2019s were jumping uncontrollably. Again, I struggled to control the vehicle and had to decelerate by removing my foot from the gas pedal.  I had to put my emergency lights on, so other vehicles would hopefully go around me. Almost home, I could barely accelerate after stopping for a red light, then my car dramatically slowed to about 10mph with a tractor trailer approaching behind me, though thankfully, on a less-traveled road, so I had time to pull over, not completely stopping because I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t accelerate at all if I did, from experience with the first transmission. After the truck passed, I slowly managed to make it uphill to the next intersection, where again, once accelerating when I turned, the car began jerking erratically. It never made it above 30mph for the last 3 minutes home. It was late at night and very dark. This car - this transmission issue - is absolutely terrifying. To drive along a consistent speed and suddenly have an out-of-control vehicle, with numerous cars around you while driving 70mph, is terrifying.  My last transmission died while driving - had that happened on the dark interstate, no doubt I would have caused an accident. I have a 2.5 year old amd 15 year old - there is no way I trust this vehicle with them in it.  I\u2019m now afraid of my vehicle stopping in the middle of a busy roadway and causing a catastrophic accident just to get it to the dealership 25 minutes away.

The problems got worse and we took it to another dealer. They dropped the pan and \"checked\" for metal shavings. New fluid added and sent on our way again, saying nothing is wrong, that this is normal for a CVT transmission. Obviously no one was going to fix or replace it and all we could do was to continue to drive the vehicle. Now the transmission has failed completely. RPM's jumping up and down, car jerking, loss of power, we were worried of getting rear ended as we couldn't drive at a continuous speed. We barely made to a relatives house to park it. It has been towed to the dealer again and is being checked out. I cannot believe a recall has never been filed for the CVT transmission in these vehicles.

THAT'S NOT ALL MY OTHER ISSUE IS WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER, THIS IS THE 3RD TIME IT HAS WENT OUT IN THE LAST YEAR, I WENT AND HAD IT SERVICED AN THEY SAID IT WAS THE AIR COMPRESSOR, I TOOK IT TO PEP BOYS AND THE GUY THAT LOOKED AT IT HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAS HAD 47 NISSAN CENTRAS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS TO BE SERVICED FOR THE SAME REASONS, WELL ONE DAY THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS FINE BUT THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO TURN IT ON AND IT IS BLOWING NOTHING BUT HOT AIR SO HE CHECKED IT AND HE SAID THE COMPRESSOR WENT OUT AGAIN!!  THE OTHER ISSUE IS YESTERDAY I WENT TO GET DINNER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. AND MY CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 40,000 MILES ON IT YET, I REALLY HOPE WRITING TO YOU ABOUT THESE THINGS GOING WRONG WILL OPEN THE NISSAN COMPANY'S EYES BEFORE SOMEONE ACTUALLY GET KILLED DRIVING ONE OF THEIR CARS.

THE CAR ALSO HAD TRANSMISSION ISSUES IN THE PAST WITH THE O/D OFF LIGHT ENGAGING WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEED WITHOUT MY KNOWINGLY TOUCHING THE BUTTON ON THE SHIFT COLUMN.

SAID CVT WAS BAD, LIKE ALL NISSAN TRANSMISSIONS, AND THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REBUILT. THE PRICE THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE WAS A LITTLE STEEP BUT IT ALSO CAME WITH A 3 YEAR WARRANTY, ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THE TRANSMISSION IN 3 YEARS AND THEY FIX FOR FREE. I WAS TALKED INTO GOING TO NISSAN TO GET A NISSAN CERTIFIED DIAGNOSTIC AND PAY $105 FOR SOMETHING I ALREADY KNEW. THEY CALLED ME 2 DAYS AFTER MY APPOINTMENT TO TELL ME THAT IT WAS INDEED THE CVT , SURPRISE SURPRISE. I MADE A CLAIM WITH NISSAN TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY OUT OF REGULAR WARRANTY ASSISTANCE FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD CAR THAT I STILL OWE A LOT OF MONEY ON. AFTER A WEEK OF WAITING AND $200+ DOLLARS IN RENTAL CAR FEES THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR WAITING, NISSAN GETS BACK TO ME SAYING THEY CAN OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF ASSISTANCE.

SINCE I WAS IN VIRGINIA TO VISIT A FRIEND, I DROVE MY CAR WITH MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON FOR 2.5 (WHICH TOOK 20 MINUTES BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET OVER 25 MPH) AND PARKED IT AT HIS HOUSE. I ENDED UP HAVING IT TOWED FROM VIRGINIA BACK TO MARYLAND THE NEXT MONDAY.    I BOUGHT MY CAR BRAND NEW OFF THE LOT WITH 36 MILES ON IT. I HAD ALREADY HAD MY TRANSMISSION REPLACE WITH THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY (NISSAN HAD TO REPLACE IT). THIS IS DANGEROUS. WHAT IF MY TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE STARTED STALLING ON 95 SOUTH?

THE CAR KEEPS JUMPING AND WON'T DRIVE CORRECTLY SO I FINALLY TAKE IT BACK TO NISSAN, AFTER CALLING ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEM TELLING ME THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE UNTIL THEY SEE A SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT ON THE CAR FOR IT TO THROW A CODE. TODAY, OCTOBER 3, 2016, I TAKE IT BACK TO COLUMBUS NISSAN AND ABOUT HALFWAY THERE, IT WON'T SHIFT. IT THEN WONT ACCELERATE ONCE I OFF OF THE BYPASS SO I HAD TO LITERALLY ROLL INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP. THEY THEN TELL ME THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING REALLY BECAUSE THE SERVICE LIGHT ISN'T ON AND THE SERVICE MEN ARE AT LUNCH. TIFFANY, AN EMPLOYEE OF COLUMBUS NISSAN, OFFERS ME A RIDE BACK TO MY APARTMENT AND TO LEAVE ME CAR THERE FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT AFTER LUNCH. THEY LATER CALL ME AND TELL ME IT'S MY TRANSMISSION OUT YET AGAIN. THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THE NISSAN USA BUSINESS.",
