I took it to the Toyota dealership because I kept getting my oil changed at VA tire and Auto and after 2000 miles 4 quarts of oil is gone. They told me to take it to Toyota so I did and the service manger gave me a copy of the letter that was never sent to me in November 2015. I spoke to Carlos at the Toyota HQ in Texas and he said that they used the DMV website to find the second owner which is me and on my Vehicle Registration Card from DMV the Purchase date is 8/6/2015 and the car fax shows DMV reported me on 8/26/2015 new owner living in Winchester VA. Carlos explained to me that the letter was sent in May and November 2015 to Manassas VA which means it was sent twice to the 1st buyer of the car. I am thinking if this is happening to me there maybe others who were never informed of this situation. I was told by Carlos your department is the only one who can reopen this claim because I was never listed as the owner of the car that I bought 8/6/2015 and still own. I am hoping that you can help me get this claim reopen and because from the ways things look Toyota did not follow the rules of informing the correct owners of the vehicles on this Support Program they called it. Toyota said that your department did not feel it to be a recall. I would appreciate some assistance in this matter. I have all the documents proving I was the second owner. I contacted Susan Hogan for assistance because Toyota HQ said they are not responsible. My files are too big to upload I would need to email the PDF files to show you proof.",

I IMMEDIATELY PULLED ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY.  I LOOKED AROUND MY VEHICLE TO FIND EACH OF MY SIDE, REAR, AND FRONT WINDOWS INTACT.  I THEN PULLED BACK THE SUNROOF COVER, ONLY TO HAVE SHARDS OF GLASS FALL ON ME.  I DISCOVERED A LARGE WHOLE IN THE CENTER OF MY SUNROOF WINDOW.  I EXITED THE CAR TO EXAMINE THE DAMAGE FROM THE OUTSIDE.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I DISCOVERED THAT DESPITE HAVING THE SUNROOF IN THE FULLY CLOSED POSITION THE WIND DEFLECTOR SHIELD HAD POPPED UP AND THE ARMS THAT ATTACHED THE GLASS TO THE SLIDING TRACK HAD BROKEN OFF.  ADDITIONALLY, THE GLASS WAS BOWED OUTWARDS, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE BROKEN GLASS UNDERNEATH THE WIND DEFLECTOR SHIELD INSTEAD OF INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  THE FRACTURING PATTERN AND BREAK LOCATIONS WERE INDICATIVE OF A STRUCTURAL PRESSURE BREAK AND NOT AN IMPACT BREAK.  TOYOTA DENIED ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE SCION TC AND INSISTED THAT THE BREAK HAD TO HAVE OCCURRED FROM AN IMPACT.  THE WEATHER THAT DAY WAS CLEAR AND 33 F AT THE TIME OF THE BREAK WITH CLEAR SKIES.  I WAS ON AN OPEN ROAD WITH NO NEARBY OVERPASSES.  *TR",
