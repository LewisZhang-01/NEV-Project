IN 2018 IT STATED AGAIN WHEN THE CAR HAD 73,000 MI THEY UPDATED THE COMPUTER AGAIN APPARENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER UPDATE AND THEY FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION AND IT OPERATED NORMALLY FOR ABOUT 27,000 MILES THIS TIME. NOW THE CAR HAS JUST OVER 100,000 MI ON IT AND IT'S DOING IT AGAIN APPARENTLY FROM WHAT I'VE LEARNED AND HEARD YOU CAN HAVE THE TRANSMISSION FLUSHED AND PUT SOME LUBE GUARD SHUTTER FIX IN IT AND IT WILL HELP IT AND MAYBE EVEN CURE THE ISSUE ON SOME CARS BUT OTHERS IT'S TOO LATE AND THE TRANSMISSION WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED OR OVERHAULED.
