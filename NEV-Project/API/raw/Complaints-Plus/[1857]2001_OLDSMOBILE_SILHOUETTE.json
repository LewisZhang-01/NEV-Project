I SHARED A MAIL BOX WITH HIM, AND I GOT THE MAIL EVERY DAY, SO I KNOW HE NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFO ON THIS. IN 2010 MY DAD WAS INVOLVED IN A WRECK THAT WAS NOT HIS FAULT, IF YOU LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE IT WAS NOT EVEN AS BAD AS SOME YOU SEE, BUT IT WAS HIS FRONT END THAT WAS HIT STRAIGHT ON. MY DAD DID NOT LIVE, HE DIED THE NEXT DAY. THE PERSON THERE ON THE SCENE TOLD ME THAT WHILE HE WAS WEARING HIS SEAT BELT IT HADN'T APPEARED TO HAVE HELD HIM, AND UNSURE IF THE AIR BAG COMPLETELY INFLATED.  HE WAS THE ONLY FAMILY I HAD LEFT, NO PARENTS, NO GRANDPARENTS, NO SIBLINGS, AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, AND I COULD STILL HAVE HIM HERE WITH ME, IF HE WAS ONLY NOTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I DON'T WANT OTHERS TO GO THROUGH WHAT I HAVE. THE NEUROSURGEON COULD NOT BELIEVE THE SEVERITY OF HIS INJURIES IN COMPARISON TO OTHER ACCIDENTS, HIS WERE TRAUMATIC, HE HAD A SEVERE BRAIN INJURY, AND CRUSHED CHEST INJURIES, WHICH GOES RIGHT ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE BELT NOR BAG DID NOT WORK RIGHT, AND HE FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THE STEERING WHEEL.",

I DID NOT REALIZE WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE HEAD GASKETS CAUSED TO FAIL EARLY FROM THE DEX COOL ANTIFREEZE FLUID.  IF I HAD KNOWN THIS I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE ENGINE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.  I AM TRYING TO GET THE WARRANTY EXTENDED ON THE CAR BUT I DO NOT KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL I WILL BE.  PLEASE NOTE THIS VAN IS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS 37000 MILES.  *AK",
