        "summary": "The Toyota highlander was advertised as a family vehicle that safely fits 7 passengers with the captain chairs. We purchased a brand new 2022 Toyota Highlander for our family of 5. However, you cannot safely install a booster car seat in the third flow as advertised in ANY position. In every position of the third row the booster car seat covers the buckle not allowing you to secure the seat belt/booster seat. The car manual show on page 58-59 to install the booster seat on the passenger side of the third row but there is not enough space. The second picture shows a car seat in the middle using an anchor bracket that does not work for a booster seat and thus would also obsure other seat buckles thus not allowing the two other seats to be used. Toyota told us to bring the vehicle to a fire station to have the car seats installed. The fire station told us to contact to 1-866-SEAT-CHECK or www.seatcheck.org to schedule an inspection and when we called them they said they do not inspect Toyota vehicles. The dealership also suggested to us to purchase a seat belt extender. The manual also states on page 59 not to use a seat belt extender as this could cause serious injury or death. The third row does not have latches and only offers an achor in the middle seat of the back row not suitable for a booster car seat. I do not want any other family to go through what we have experienced and this is a matter of child safety.",
