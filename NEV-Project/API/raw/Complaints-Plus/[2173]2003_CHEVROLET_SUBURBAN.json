WE LIVE IN VIRGINIA WHERE THE WEATHER IS MODERATE AND THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH WINTER CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE ROAD SALTING, ETC. SO THIS IS NOT A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE LIVING IN HARSH ROAD-SALTED CONDITIONS.   I ENDED UP DECIDING TO SPEND THE $$ TO REMEDIATE THIS DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITION AND TO GET ANOTHER 10 YEARS OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

THE FACTORY REP SAID THEY COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY BECAUSE OF THE AGE AND MILEAGE, WHICH I ORIGINALLY TOLD THEM ABOUT. THE FACTORY REPS KEEP ON TRANSFERRING ME TO OTHER REPS TILL I GAVE UP. I WAS ASE TECH( EVERYTHING EXCEPT TRANSMISSIONS ) ,  MD STATE INSPECTOR  AND MD CERTIFIED EMISSIONS FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

IN THE PREVIOUS WEEKS, I HAD DRIVEN THE SUBURBAN ON MOUNTAIN ROADS IN NATIONAL FORESTS IN THE AREA THAT WERE UNPAVED AND HAD STEEP INCLINES, WAS LUCKY NOT TO HAVE HAD A FAILURE ON THOSE ROADS OR ON PAVED HIGHWAY AT HIGH SPEEDS ON THE TRIP HOME.  ALL BREAK LINES WERE REPLACED.  THIS REQUIRED REMOVAL OF THE FUEL TANK.    A FEW WEEKS LATER THE SERVICE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT CAME ON I TOOK THE SUBURBAN BACK TO THE DEALER WHO DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE FRONT FUEL TANK VENT THAT WAS ALSO RUSTED AND WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THIS REQUIRED REPLACING THE FUEL TANK SINCE THE VENT WAS NOT SOLD SEPARATELY!!  THE NEW TANK WITH VENT COST $829 DOLLARS BRINGING THE TOTAL COST OVER $3,000 DOLLARS.     NOTE, I ALSO PURCHASED A 2003 HONDA ACCORD NEW, WHICH I STILL HAVE, AND HAVE DRIVEN IT FOR OVER 70,000 MILES AND IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THE 2003 SUBURBAN, AND IT HAS NO SIGNS OF RUST ON THE BRAKE LINES OR FUEL LINES.

SPECIFICALLY THE SPEEDOMETER WILL STOP WORKING OR GO ALL THE WAY TO 120 MPH.  THE FUEL AND OIL GAUGES WILL NOT BE ACCURATE (FOR EXAMPLE IT WILL SAY THE TANK IS EMPTY WHEN IT'S FULL).

A FEW TIMES I HAVE BEEN DRIVING 55 MPH ON THE EXPRESSWAY AND IT WILL JUST SHUT OFF.  SO FAR I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH NOT TO GET REAR ENDED, I DON'T KNOW WHEN MY LUCK WILL RUN OUT.  THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE CAR FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT IT WAS ONLY UNTIL 2010 OR IF THE ODOMETER WAS BETWEEN 70,001 AND 80,000 MILES.  MY CAR IS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND OVER 100,000 MILES.

THIS IS OUR ONLY VEHICLE SO WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE WITH OUR HAZARDS ON BECAUSE WE HAVE 4 KIDS AT 3 DIFFERENT SCHOOLS TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP EACH DAY.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE ONLINE, I AM SEEING THAT THIS IS OCCURRING IN HUNDREDS OF CHEVROLET AND GM CARS.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE 2 ARE THE SAME COMPANY.  I DO NOT DARE GET ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY OR INTERSTATE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF THE CAR SHUTTING DOWN AND CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  CHEVROLET AND GM ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS WITH BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE NHTSA.  WHY IS THERE NO RECALL TO FIX THIS?  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND COULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DEADLY ACCIDENT.  I AM DISCUSSING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND ONCE THE INFO IS COLLECTED, I WILL CONTACT AN ATTORNEY.  PLEASE HELP GET THESE UNSAFE VEHICLES OFF OF THE ROAD AND INTO THE DEALERSHIPS TO BE FIXED.  THANK YOU.  *KB",

GENERAL MOTORS HAS EVEN OFFERED TO PROVIDE OWNERS WITH A SPECIAL COVERAGE THAT EXTENDS THE WARRANTY ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER FOR THE CONDITION DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS LONG AS THE VEHICLES AGE AND MILEAGE FALLS WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS.

I COULD NOT STOP THE SEAT FROM JAMMING ME INTO THE STEERING WHEEL.    WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE CAR. THE REASON THEY KNOW ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE REPLACED SO MANY OF THEM ALREADY.

APPROX. 10 DAYS LATER THEY NOTIFIED ME THAT I COULD BRING IT IN FOR REPAIR, BUT THAT THEY WOULD ASSESS CAREFULLY IF ACTUALLY A WARRANTY ITEM OR NOT.  UPON BRINGING THE VEHICLE IN, THE CHEV DEALERSHIP MECHANIC DECIDED THAT YES - THEY WOULD FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY.  THE REPAIR HOWEVER, WAS QUITE LENGTHY IN TIME AND INVOLVED THREE CHEV MECHANICS WHO WORKED IN GRETA FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION AS TO HOW TO REPLACE THE BELT AND TENSION DEVICE AS THEY  HAD LITTLE EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE IN HOW TO ACTUALLY INSTALL THE NEW PART.
