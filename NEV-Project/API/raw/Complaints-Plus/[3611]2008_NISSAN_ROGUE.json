EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS THAT THE OTHER 2008 ROGUES THAT WERE RECALLED DID,  THE MFG REFUSED TO INCLUDE THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE IN THE RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE BUT  OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE. THE CONTACT RESEARCHED THE COST TO FIX THE FAILURE AND IT WOULD BE OVER $2000. THE MFG TOLD  THE CONTACT THAT DUE TO THE CURRENT MILEAGE OF THE VEHICLE, 190218 AS OF FEB 2020, THEY COULD NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE.  CONTACT WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS TOO OLD AND HAD TOO MANY MILES FOR THEM TO GIVE ANY ASSISTANCE.*DT*JB",

I BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY CONFIRMED THE MALFUNCTIONING FUEL SENDING UNIT ON 10/13/17. BUT, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND THEY HAD NO DISCRETION OR ABILITY TO MAKE A REPAIR OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT I NEEDED TO CALL CONSUMER AFFAIRS.    I CALLED CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON 10/13/17 AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO TWO INDIVIDUALS. BOTH WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WASN'T ACCEPTABLE THAT I'M NOW DEALING WITH THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THAT A REGIONAL CONSUMER AFFAIRS SPECIALIST WOULD REVIEW THE CASE AND MY SERVICE RECORDS, AND THEN CONTACT ME WITH A DECISION.    AFTER BACK AND FORTH WITH THE SPECIALIST AND HER SUPERVISOR, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE REJECTING MY CASE BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I QUESTIONED THAT AS A REASON, GIVEN I WAS DIRECTED TO THIS GROUP FOR AN 'OUT OF WARRANTY' REVIEW. I EXPLAINED AGAIN THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED THIS SAME PROBLEM REPEATEDLY. THIS HAD RESULTED IN THE SAME PART BEING REPLACED MULTIPLE TIMES UNDER WARRANTY. AND EACH OF THOSE TIMES, IT BROKE ' POINTING TO EITHER FAULTY PARTS BEING INSTALLED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, OR IMPROPER INSTALLATION WHILE UNDER WARRANTY.    I BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO AS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT COULD RESULT IN SOMEONE RUNNING OUT OF GAS WHILE DRIVING. NISSAN DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE TAKING THE ISSUE SERIOUSLY.

MY CAR NOW HAS 123000 THEY HAVE A EXTENDED THEIR WARRANTY TO 120000 . MY PROBLEM WITH NISSAN IS THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN INTO THEIR DEALERSHIP BEFORE THEY SAID IT WAS FINE AND IF I KNEW ABOUT THERE EXTENDED WARRANTY I WOULD HAVE TAKEN MY CAR IN. NOW THE SECOND DIAGNOSTIC IN CALIFORNIA THAT I HAVE TO PAY 160 THEY SAID THAT I NEED NEW TRANSMISSION  AND PENDING IN HOW THEY GOING TO HELP ME.

EVIDENTLY THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH IT AT THAT TIME.  THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE PART. MY GUESS IS THAT THEY RESET IT AND THAT WORKED AT THAT TIME.    I NOW HAVE A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR ANYONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND THAT REQUIRES APPROXIMATELY $1,700 TO REPLACE A PART THAT IS UNDER RECALL BY NISSAN THAT THEY CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR.  THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO BE MADE TO BACK UP THE VOLUNTARY RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE FOR THE NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCIN THIS ISSUE.  ALSO, PEOPLE CHECKING VIN NUMBERS TO SEE IF THEIR VEHICLE WAS PART OF THAT RECALL NEED TO LOOK FURTHER AS WHEN I CHECKED MY VIN NUMBER IT DID NOT SHOW THAT IT WAS PART OF THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT ACTUALLY WAS PART OF THAT RECALL.",

THERE WAS A RECALL OF MY EXACT MAKE AND MODEL BUT OF COURSE NOT MY VIN#. NOW, THE STATE OF HAWAII WILL NOT LET ME PASS MY SAFETY INSPECTION- BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY WELL OF THE SAFETY CONCERN OF THE AIRBAG NOT DEPLOYING. SO I TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO TELLS ME I HAVE TO REPLACE THE SEAT CUSHION- TO THE TUNE OF OVER $2000! I WROTE TO NISSAN CORPORATE WHO BASICALLY TOLD ME TO SHUT UP AND STOP COMPLAINING. THIS IS A JOKE & I AM CERTAIN WE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO DIE BEFORE NISSAN IS ACTUALLY HELD RESPONSIBLE. NOW I HAVE A VEHICLE THAT I CAN NO LONGER DRIVE SINCE MY STATE HAS DEEMED IT UNSAFE- OR MY OTHER OPTION IS TO PAY 1/3 OF WHAT THE CAR IS WORTH TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT IS ALREADY KNOWN & THERE ARE 100S OF COMPLAINTS. I HOPE YOU GUYS MOVE THIS ALONG BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TO MAKE A CAR PAYMENT ON A CAR I CANNOT DRIVE, PAY OVER $2000 TO REPLACE THE WHOLE SEAT, OR PAY IT OFF AND JUNK THE CAR, SINCE I CANNOT SELL AN UNSAFE VEHICLE THAT WON'T PASS A SAFETY INSPECTION. NONE OF THESE OPTIONS ARE EXACTLY GREAT FOR ME. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR TO CONSUMERS & SEEMS MORE LIKE A WAY FOR NISSAN DEALERSHIPS TO INCREASE PROFITS. I HOPE YOU MOVE QUICKLY ON THIS BEFORE INNOCENT LIVES ARE TAKEN BY A KNOWN FAULTY AIRBAG SENSOR.

I THOUGHT THAT TOO MUCH, BUT WHEN THE TAKATA RECALLS BEGAN, AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO DIE, I BECAME MORE CONCERNED. I LIVE IN HAWAII, WHICH IS VERY HOT AND HUMID. THE REALITY IS EITHER THE SENSOR OR THE AIRBAG HAS NOT WORKED PROPERLY FROM NEARLY THE TIME I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW. IT'S OBVIOUSLY FAULTY, AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS.

I ASKED NISSAN FOR DATA ON FAILURES AND - OF COURSE - THEY SAID THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE.    THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE THE CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF A TRANSMISSION COULD LEAD TO A DEADLY ACCIDENT.  *TR",

CAR CAME TO STOP AND UNABLE TO MOVE AGAIN. HAD CAR TOWED BACK TO MY HOUSE SENT TO SHOP TO FIND OUT THAT TRANSMISSION HAD MALFUNCTIONED. DOING RESEARCH ON TRANSMISSION FOUND OUT THE NISSAN ROUGE IS USING CVT TRANSMISSION AND THAT NISSAN EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 120K OR 10 YEARS. MY RESEARCH ALSO FOUND OUT THAT OTHER NISSAN OWNERS OF ROGUE AND MURANOS WERE HAVING ISSUES WITH CVT TRANSMISSION. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT ABOUT THE WARRANTY I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER CARE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THIS. I WAS TOLD MY MODEL AND MAKE QUALIFIED UNDER WARRANTY AND THAT MILEAGE DIDN'T MATTER. NISSAN DECIDED NOT TO ASSIST ME WITH REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF TRANSMISSION. I TRIED TO TELL NISSAN ABOUT LETTER THAT STATED THEY WOULD DECREASE COST EVEN ABOVE 120K. THEY REFUSED TO DO SO. I HAD NO WARNING SENSORS THAT THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH TRANSMISSION. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A BAD ACCIDENT IF THE TRANSMISSION HAD OF WENT OUT DURING HEAVY TRAFFIC. IT APPEARS READING ABOUT OTHER OWNERS EXPERIENCES WITH CVT TRANSMISSIONS THAT NISSAN DOESN'T WANT TO OWN UP TO HAVING A FAULTY TRANSMISSION. EVEN SPEAKING WITH MECHANICS FROM OUTSIDE AND WITH NISSAN THAT THIS TRANSMISSION IS FAULTY AND MANY HAVE ISSUES AND COMPLAINANTS ABOUT IT.  *TR",

IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY INFORMED THE PUBLIC OF PROBLEM OR JUST SOLD THE VEHICLE WITH A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM THAT COULD NOT BE CORRECTED.  TO DATE THERE APPEARS TO BE NO  FIX TO THIS PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUE GIVEN THE HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS REAR-END ACCIDENTS.  *TR",

I HAD TO DRIVE AT ABOUT 40 MILES PER HOUR UNTIL I FOUND A SAFE PLACE TO STOP. I HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS AND THE TRIED DRIVING AGAIN AND IT WORKED FINE.

FOR INSTANCE, IF I WAS DRIVING WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON, IT WOULD SHUT OFF AND GRADUALLY START TO DECELERATE. STEPPING ON THE GAS DID NOTHING. IN SOME CASES, I WOULD BE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY ONLY ABLE TO GO ABOUT 25 MPH.

AFTER TAKING MY CAR TO THREE DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS, NISSAN FINALLY BEGAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE WAS AN SYSTEM ISSUE (NOT AFTER MAKING ME SPEND $400+ FOR A TRANSMISSION FLUSH). THEY SAID THAT THE COMBINATION OF ELEVATION, HEAT AND HIGH SPEEDS WAS CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO OVERHEAT AND GO INTO \"FAIL SAFE\" MODE. FINALLY LAST SUMMER (JULY 2012) NISSAN REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION IN THE VEHICLE. NOW, ONE YEAR LATER AND ONLY 20,000 MILES ON THE NEW TRANSMISSION, I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUES.

IT WOULD ALSO NOT PULL OFF FROM STOPS BUT RATHER JUST COAST OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION, LEAVING THE DRIVER WITHOUT CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  WE WERE INSTRUCTED BY THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO LIMP THE CAR BACK TO ATLANTA SO THEY COULD REPLACE THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND STATED THEY KNEW IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THOSE PARTICULAR CVT'S.  ONCE WE GOT THE CAR BACK, NISSAN EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD INSTALLED A NEWER MODEL OF CVT IN OUR CAR AND THAT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.  NOW, JUNE 23, 2012, OUR CAR IS BACK AT THE DEALER WITH THE SAME ISSUE.  THE CAR NOW HAS 102,00 MILES.  THIS TIME WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE WHEN THE CVT BEGINS TO ACT UP.  SYMPTOMS INCLUDED LOSS OF POWER, LOSS OF SPEED AND IDLE LEAVING US UNABLE TO SWITCH LANES AND GET OFF HIGHWAY DUE TO LACK OF PULL AND POWER.

I WENT TO DEALERSHIP FOR A NOISE I HEARD ALSO ON TRIP,  MOTOR MOUNTS WERE LOOSE BUT NOISE DID NOT CHANGE.  AY THAT TIME I LET THEM KNOW ABOUT LOSS OF POWER.

SPECIALIST SUPPOSEDLY FLEW IN TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION  FLUID WAS A TINY BIT TO  HIGH.  I TOLD THEM I BOUGHT IT OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR, AFTER BLINKING OF EYES THEY STILL CLAIMED THAT WAS THE REASON. THIS YEAR NEXT ROAD TRIP AND IT DID THE SAME THING AT 4 DIFFERENT TIMES...VERY SCARY!!!  IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE.  MY SON TOOK IT TO AIRPORT TO PCK FRIENDS UP, IT HAPPENED A HOUR AND A HALF FROM HOME.  THEN RECURRED IN 5 LANES OF CITY INTERSTATE TRAFFIC.  HE WAS SO CLOSE TO GETTING HIT BY THE GRACE OF GOD HE DIDN'T.  I TOOK IT TO THE CITY 2 WEEKS AGO AND IT DID THE SAME TO ME.  IT IS SO SCARY TO BE GOING ALONG AT 65 MPH IN 5 LANES OF  BUMPER TRAFFIC AND LOOSE POWER.  NOW I AM MAKING PAYMENTS ON A CAR THAT I COULD NOT EVEN TRUST TO DRIVE MY KID BACK TO COLLEGE THIS YEAR.

NISSAN HAS REFUSED TO SERVICE MY VEHICLE WITHOUT EXORBITANT REPAIR FEES.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE FOLLOWING:    1. HAVING A SECURE ENVIRONMENT IS PARAMOUNT IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS IT'S IMPERATIVE NOBODY CAN GAIN ACCESS AT WILL BY WALKING UP TO THE CAR. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT.  2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.  THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITTENT OF OPERATION. SOMETIMES THE DOORS LOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T. IN ADDITION, SOMETIMES THE DOORS UNLOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T.    3. IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALER).
