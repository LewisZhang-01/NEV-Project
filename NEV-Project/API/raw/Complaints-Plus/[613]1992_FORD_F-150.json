THE TRUCK WAS PARKED WITH THE PARKING BRAKE APPLIED AND THE TRANSMISSION IN REVERSE. THE TRUCK HAS A STANDARD TRANSMISSION. THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND THE PARKING BRAKE PEDAL WOULDN'T MOVE WHEN RELEASED. I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK. THE BRAKE CABLE WAS LOOSE AND LAYING ON THE GROUND.THE ONLY THING KEEPING MY TRUCK FROM ROLLING DOWN MY DRIVE WAS THE TRANSMISSION. BOTH TIMES THE EQULIZER FAILED UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION. I THINK THE EQULIZER SHOULD BE MADE FROM HEAVIER STEEL TO LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. *AK",
