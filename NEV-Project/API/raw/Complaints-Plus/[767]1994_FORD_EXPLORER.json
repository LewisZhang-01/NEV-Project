HERE IT IS 2004 AND THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED BUT HAS GOTTEN WORSE. PURCHASED TWO NEW ALARM/ENTRY DEVICES (FOBS) ON 29 JUN 04 BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD BY ONE OF THE MECHANICS THAT THE NEW DEVICES SHOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THIS BILL CAME TO $211.10.  ALREADY PAID $70.65 ON OR ABOUT APRIL 28, 2004 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND TOLD THE REPAIR PART NEEDED COST $210.  I WAS UPSET AND ONLY PAID FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC.  I'M GLAD WE DIDN\u0019T PAY FOR THAT PART, BECAUSE EACH SUCCESSIVE TIME, THE SOLUTION TO THE \"PROBLEM\" HAS BEEN DIFFERENT AND COST ADDITIONAL MONEY.   NOTHING THE MECHANICS HAVE DONE HAS RESOLVED THE PROBLEM; ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE AND THE COST HAVE TOTALED $814.67 FOR THIS PROBLEM SO FAR.  THE MECHANIC SAID THE VEHICLE NOT STARTING BACK UP AFTER IT HAS BEEN TURNED OFF IS TIED IN TO THE ALARM SYSTEM.  THEY HAVE REPLACED THE ANTI THEFT CONTROL MODULE ON 26 JULY 2004,  $368.82.

I HAVE REPLACED THE BRAKE ROTORS TWICE AND REPLACED THE BRAKE PADS THREE TIMES. THE LAST TIME I COMPLETED BRAKE WORK WAS BECAUSE THE LEFT FRONT CALIPER OVERHEATED AND FAILED. I THEN REPLACED BOTH FRONT CALIPERS. THERE IS A BAD VIBRATION PROBLEM AT SPEEDS OF 55-67 MPH. I RECENTLY PURCHASED FOUR NEW TIRES, HAD THEM BALANCED, HAD THE FRONT END ALIGNED, AND REPLACED THE SHOCKS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. IT STILL VIBRATES AT THE ABOVE MENTIONED SPEEDS. ALSO, THE VEHICLE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THE PCM (CHECK ENGINE LIGHT). I REPLACED THE PCM AS A LAST RESORT BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY REPLACED ALL THE SENSORS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSING THE PROBLEM. REPLACING THE PCM CORRECTED THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT A YEAR, BUT NOW THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN DURING INITIAL STARTING AND THEN GOES OUT AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 2-3 MILES. I ALSO HAVE A SOUND COMING FROM MY AIR VENTS WHEN THE A/C IS TURNED ON. NOW FOR MY MOST RECENT PROBLEM.

THEN AFTER A SHORT  TIME IT WOULD ALWAYS ADD ABOUT 30MPH TO ANY SPEED OVER 35MPH. I CHECKED WITH FORD TO FIND OUT IF THIS HAD BEEN A PROBLEM OR SUBJECT TO ANY  RECALLS AND WAS TOLD NO. AT THAT TIME  HAD THE SPEEDOMETER REPAIRED AT AN INDEPENDENT SHOP (SAN DIEGO SPEEDO TACH INC. 619-235-0314). THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM ON FORD EXPLORERS AND FORD RANGERS AND THAT THEY REPAIRED SEVERAL A WEEK!   NLM",

I HAVE A CENTURY MODEL 1165ONHS, MAN.062997, THAT WAS BOUGHT FOR MY 3 1/2 YEAR OLD SON AND WAS HANDED DOWN TO HER.  THE SEAT IS IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER BUT SHE IS A BIT OF AN ACROBAT.  AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD I LOOKED INTO MY REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SAW HER STANDING IN HER SEAT, FACING ME!!!  I AM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE I PUT HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE WE LEFT MY IN-LAWS A FEW MINUTES PRIOR TO HER ESCAPE.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND TIGHTENED THE STRAP FROM THE BACK WITH THE BAR AND PUT HER BACK INTO HER CAR SEAT, KICKING AND SCREAMING MIND YOU.  NOT  A 1/2 MILE LATER, AS SHE WAS STILL SCREAMING, I NOTICED HER CRYING BECAME MUFFLED.  IT WAS EVENING TIME SO I COULDN'T SEE HER IN THE MIRROR I INSTALLED ON THE SEAT IN FRONT OF HER.  AGAIN, I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND WAS TERRIFIED BY WHAT I SAW!  SHE HAD AGAIN TWISTED OUT OF HER SEAT AND WAS BEING STRANGLED BY THE WHITE CLASP THAT  HOLDS THE 2 STRAPS TOGETHER.  SHE HAD TWISTED HERSELF AROUND, THROWN HE LEGS OUT OF THE SEAT TO HER RIGHT AND WAS HANGING BY THE CLASP.  FROM HER WAIST DOWN, SHE WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SEAT, HANGING OVER THE SIDE AND STUCK.   I HAD MADE SURE THE CLASP WAS HIGH UP ON HER CHEST TO PREVENT HER FROM GETTING OUT, WHICH HAD PREVENTED ENOUGH ROOM FOR HER HEAD TO COME OUT.  THE STRAPS WERE ALSO VERY TIGHT ON HER.  THEY PULLED HER SHOULDERS DOWN WHEN I STRAPPED HER BACK IN.  I THOUGHT THAT WOULD KEEP HER IN.  IT DID NOT!  THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN HAS NEVER CROSSED MY MIND.  MY SON HAD NEVER ATTEMPTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  IT SCARES ME TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I WASN'T ABLE TO PULL OVER AS FAST AS I DID.  MAYBE IF   ALL INFANT CAR SEATS WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE  A 5 POINT HARNESS OR LAP BAR, THAT WOULD HELP.  WE DID BUY HER A NEW CAR SEAT LAST NIGHT, EQUIPPED WITH A LAP BAR. PLEASE HELP!

VEHICLE IS USED AS A PASSANGER VEHICLE NOT FOR HAULING OR TOWING.  FAILURE OCCURS WHEN BRAKE PAD LINING CRACKS, CRUMBLES, AND DISSINTEGRATES LEAVING ONLY BRAKE BACKING AGAINST ROTOR FOR BRAKING.  THIS USUALLY HYPER-EXTENDS THE CALLIPER AND SCORES THE ROTOR BEYOND REPAIR (TURNING DOWN) REQUIRING REPLACEMENT OF BRAKE PADS, ROTOR ASSEMBLY, AND CALLIPER ASSEMBLY.  WHEN FAILURE OCCURS, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO BRAKING ACTION (PEDAL DROPS TO THE FLOOR) UNTIL BRAKE PEDAL IS PUMPED AFTER WHICH A GRINDING NOISE (BRAKE PAD BACKING INTO ROTOR) IS HEARD.  FAILURE HAS USUALLY OCCURED AT LOWER SPEEDS WHEN APPROACHING A STOP. *AK",

SEEMS TO HAPPEN ONLY AFTER SHORT TRIPS, LESS THAN 10-15 MILES. REPLACED THE FUEL CIRCUIT RELAY 2 MONTHS AGO, HAD ONLY ONE REOCCURRENCE A WEEK LATER. NOW FOR THE PAST 2 MONTHS THERE IS A MUCH WORSE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF RANDOMLY USUALLY WHILE DRIVING BETWEEN 55-70 MPH. NO SPUTTERS, NO BACKFIRES, NO INDICATIONS THAT THE ENGINE HAS SHUT OFF OTHER THAN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DIMS AND THE GAUGES STOP READING. THE ENGINE WON'T RESTART UNTIL AFTER A FEW MINUTES HAVE PASSED BEFORE TRYING TO CRANK IT AGAIN. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT USUALLY HAPPENS WHILE TRAVELING 70 MPH. DEALERSHIP IS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, NO ERROR CODES ARE REPORTING.   FUEL PUMP: FUEL GAUGE NOT WORKING FOR SEVERAL YEARS, HOLE IN FLOAT PER DEALERSHIP, SO ENTIRE FUEL PUMP REPLACED AT MY COST. FUEL GAUGE APPEARED TO BE WORKING CORRECTLY; HOWEVER, ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS ONCE THE TANK GOT DOWN TO 1/4 FULL THE GAUGE WOULD START OFF AT 1/4 BUT THEN AFTER DRIVING FOR 5 OR 10 MINS. THE GAUGE WOULD GO ALL THE WAY TO FULL. AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF WORKING SPORADICALLY, IT IS NOW CONSISTENTLY GOING TO FULL EVERYTIME THE TANK GETS DOWN TO 1/4. DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE FUEL SENDING UNIT AS DEFECTIVE BUT WILL NOT COVER UNDER THE WARRANTY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ONLY BEEN 6 MOS. , IT IS APPROX. 2000 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY LIMIT OF 12,000 MILES/12 MONTHS. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SAME $340.00 PARTS & LABOR AS 6 MONTHS AGO. I FEEL THIS IS UNFAIR SO DECLINED THE WORK, NOW BEING CHARGED $67.00 DIAGNOSTIC FEE!

I ASKED MY MECHANIC IF TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WERE COMMON WITH EXPLORERS AND HE SAID YES.  HE PROVIDED ME WITH A COPY OF SEVERAL YEARS OF ADVISORIES THAT FORD SENT TO MECHANICS,  WARNING THEM OF PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS,  AND SPECIFICALLY WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  THIS IS THE MAIN PART WHICH WENT ON MY TRANSMISSION.  I FELT THAT IF FORD FELT THE NEED TO SEND REPEATED ADVISORIES TO MECHANICS,  THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM(S) THAT SHOULD HAVE INVOLVED A RECALL.  I SENT A LETTER TO FORD ON NOVEMBER 4, 1998 AND NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY.  I AM ENCLOSING A COPY OF THIS LETTER.  I SINCE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE SECOND TRANSMISSION AT 100,000 MILES.  THE FIRST ONE COST ME $1881.50 AND THE SECOND ONE $1465.  I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COST OF BOTH TRANSMISSIONS BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRANSMISSION FAILURES DUE TO PROBLEMS THEY NOTIFIED MECHANICS ABOUT IN THEIR ADVISORIES.

I DID NOT HEAR A BLOWOUT AND WHEN I REALIZED THE TIRES THAT WERE SHREDDING WERE MINE AND NOT A TRUCKERS I STARTED TO MOVE OVER TO THE RIGHT LANE SO I COULD GET OFF ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY.  BY THE TIME I GOT OVER TO THE SHOULDER, I WAS DRIVING ON THE RIM.  THE COST TO REPAIR THE RIM WAS $125.00.  THE REMAINING ORIGINAL FOUR FIRESTONE TIRES WERE REPLACED IN NOVEMBER 1999 AT MONTGOMERY WARDS AT CROSSROADS MALL IN OKLAHOMA CITY.  ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT RECALL WE CAN NOT GET REIMBURSED BECAUSE THE TIRES WERE PURCHASED BEFORE JAN. 2000.  I AM THANKFUL MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED LIKE MANY OTHERS, BUT I DO NOT THINK IT IS FAIR WE CANNOT GET REIMBURSED FOR FAULTY TIRES OR THE REPAIR OF THE RIM BECAUSE THE PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT SOONER THAN IT WAS.  ALSO, WE DID EXPERIENCE THE SHREDDING OF OUR RIGHT REAR TIRE AND HOPEFULLY THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP YOUR CONTINUED INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THERE MAY BE MORE INCIDENTS OF FAULTY TIRES LIKE OURS, BUT BECAUSE NO ACCIDENT NEEDED TO BE REPORTED AND INSURANCE COVERAGE DOES NOT APPLY BECAUSE THE DEDUCTIBLE IS TOO HIGH, CONSEQUENTLY, NOTHING WAS EVER REPORTED BECAUSE THE EXPENSE FELL ON THE OWNER.( DOT NUMBER: ?

WAL-MART BALANCED MY TIRES FOR NOTHING THAT DAY, EXPLAINING THAT MY TIRES WERE THE PROBLEM.  ON JULY 1, 2000, I WENT BACK TO WAL-MART AND HAD THEM REPLACE THE TWO BACK FIRESTONE RADIAL ATX'S WITH GOODYEAR ALL SEASON TRACKER TIRES.  I HAVE THE FIRESTONE RADIAL ATX P235/75R15 DOT # VNHL-1MO'S, WHICH WAL-MART TOOK OFF.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST FIRESTONE STORE WHO CHECKED THE TIRE AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TIRE.  THEY SAID A CERTAIN PART WAS BAD IN THE FRONT END OF MY EXPLORER AND IT WOULD COST ME ABOUT $150 OR SO TO HAVE HAVE THEM FIX IT.NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER TIRE DEALER WHO CHECKED THE FRONT END AND INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO BAD PART, THE FRONT END WAS NOT OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND THE PROBLEM WAS A DEFECT IN THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE.  TO PROVE IT TO ME, THEY MOVED THE TIRE FROM THE FRONT RIGHT TO THE REAR RIGHT.  THE VIBRATION AND THE NOISE MOVED WITH THE TIRE. WENT BACK TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER AND TOLD THEM WHAT THE OTHER DEALER HAD TOLD ME.  THEY ALL BUT CALLED BOTH ME AND THE OTHER DEALER A LIAR.  ACTUALLY, ALL THEY HAD TO DO TO BEGIN WITH WAS SAY, \"OK, THE TIRE IS BAD.  YOU'LL NEED TO PAY $X DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF USE YOU HAVE HAD\" AND I WOULD HAVE DONE IT AND BOUGHT 2 NEW TIRES FROM THE DEALER.

I DID NOT SUFFER A BLOWOUT AND WAS ABLE TO SAFELY CHANGE THE TIRE AND CONTINUE HOME.  THE FOLLOWING DAY I PURCHASED 4 BRAND NEW MICHELIN RADIAL TIRES AT NTB.  I DID NOT REPORT THIS TREAD FAILURE TO FIRESTONE OR THE FORD DEALERSHIP AT THE TIME SINCE I WAS UNAWARE THAT OTHER EXPLORER DRIVERS WERE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR TREAD FAILURES.  AFTER READING RECENT REPORTS ABOUT FIRESTONE ATX TIRE TREAD FAILURES IN USA TODAY I DECIDED TO SEND THIS E-MAIL SO THAT MY EXPERIENCE CAN BE DOCUMENTED AND INCLUDED IN YOUR STATISTICS.  I DID NOT KEEP THE DAMAGED TIRE NOR DO I HAVE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE TREAD FAILURE.  I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY THAT THE TIRE DID NOT BLOW OUT AND I DID NOT SUFFER THE SAME FATAL CONSEQUENCES AS OTHER FORD EXPLORER DRIVERS.  WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY I COULD FEEL AN EXTREME BUMPINESS BEFORE THE PIECE OF TREAD LET LOOSE WITH A LOUD \"POW\" AND A CLOUD OF DUST AND RUBBER IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR.  HOPEFULLY MY EXPERIENCE WILL HAVE SOME VALUE IN YOUR INVESTIGATION, AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU FURTHER.  - CHARLIE CURTIN  S( DOT NUMBER: ? TIRE SIZE: P235/75R15 )",

THEN, ON 8/2/99, WE ARE AGAIN ON I-80 HEADED FROM HASTINGS TO OMAHA.  WE NOTICE THAT THE CAR IS SHIMMYING/VIBRATING WITH INCREASING MAGNITUDE.

POINT 2, YOU HAVE 2 ID NUMBERS OF THE SAME PROBLEM. FORD DID NOT MENTION THE LATEST RECALL, ID# 99V310001, THAT HAS A 1999 YEAR OF RECALL. I ONLY SPOKE WITH FORD LAST WEEK, 12/08/99. WHY DIDIN'T THEY REFER TO THIS ID#. THIRDLY, I DO N OT BELEIVE THIS DEFECT IS A FUNCTION OF TIME OR MILEAGE. IT IS A FUNCTION OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE HATCH IS OPENED AND REPRESENTS A SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY EXPOSURE. MY WIFE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND TOLD ME THE REAR HATCH WAS MAKING A POPPING SOUND. I OPENED THE HATCH TWICE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND THE BRACKET BROKE THE SECOND TIME. THE HATCH DROPPED DOWN IMMEDIATLEY AND I HAD TO CATCH IT. HAD THIS HAPPENED TO MY WIFE, OR WORSE YET,  WHILE HOLDING OUR 2 YR OLD, THERE IS NO WAY SHE WAY SHE COULD HAVE RESTRAINED THE DOOR. I AM SURE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURY. FORD STATED TO ME THAT EVEN IF I HAD RECEIVED A OWNER NOTIFICATION, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE REPAIRED THE PROBLEM IF IT SHOWED NO SIGN OF FAILURE. I HAVE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY DEFECT AND CORRECTED. THE DEFECT THAT THEY ADMIT TO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH A RESULT OF PERSONAL INJURY WITH 1.5 MILLION VEHICLES WITH THE DEFECT. THIS DEFECT WILLL NOT ALWAYS MANIFEST ITSELF WITHIN 6 YEARS OR 60,000 MILES. IT IS A FUNCTION OF USAGE AND THEREFORE THE CASE SHOULD BE REOPENED AND PROPER NOTIFICATION AND REMEDY PROVIDED. LASTLY, THE DEFECT ALSO CAUSES A PPROBLEM WITH THE REAR HATCH PROPERLY SECURING AFTER THE BRACKET HAS BROKEN. THE WEIGHT OF THE DOOR CAUSES THE HATCH TO MIS ALIGN AND WILL NOT SECURLEY LATCH.",

FORD CANT ISSUE A  RECALL ON SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BROKE WHEN THE RECALL IS ISSUED KNOWING THAT AT SOME POINT IT IS GOING TO BREAK BUT WE ARENT GOING  TO FIX IT. THIS IS OFFENSIVE TO ME BECOUSE THE EXPLORER HAS MULTIPLE  MECHANICAL PROBLEMS BUT I WRITE THOSE OFF TO WEAR AND TEAR. THE  TAILGATE SHOULD NOT FAIL. FORD SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ON WHATEVER YEAR THE VEHICLE MAY BE. I AM GOIN TO CONTINUE INVESTIGATING AND FIND SOME WAY TO GET THEM TO FIX IT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF MAYBE YOU HAVE ALREADY SOLVED THE NEGOTIATING PROBLEM. IN MY MANUAL THERE IS  A WARRANTY THAT SAYS ITS AGAINST ANY SHEETMETAL DETERIORATION FOR 6 YRS OR 100,000 MILES I WONDER IF THIS APPLIES IN MY SITUATION. I SURE HOPE THAT  YOU ALL CAN HELP ME OUT OR LET ME KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS  PROBLEM.  THANX",
