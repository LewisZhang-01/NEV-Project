THEY ADVISE ME TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP WHEN I PURCHASE THE VEHICLE THAT THE PART WILL BE CHANGE AND THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF THE COST.  I TOOK THE CAR TO AUTO NATION NISSAN DALLAS, I WAS TOLD THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE, THAT THEY WILL CALL ME WHEN ARRIVES.  TWO WEEKS PASSED, NO CALL.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN WAS WITHHOLDING THE PART.  THIS WAS 5 WEEKS AGO, TODAY 8/4/16 I CALLED BACK TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN HAS A BACK ORDER.  THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE, WE ARE DRIVING DEFECTIVE VEHICLES AND NOT ONE IS DOING ANYTHING TO HELP.  I NEED TO USE MY VEHICLE TO GO TO WORK EVERYDAY, I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FORM OF TRANSPORTATION.  I AM PUTTING MY LIFE IN DANGER EVERYDAY THANKS TO THE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM NISSAN",

NISSAN ENGINEERING DIDN'T KNOW THE CAUSE AND SAID TO \"DRIVE IT UNTIL IT GETS WORSE\". MY CAR WAS ALMOST AT THE END OF THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY. THEY REPLACED A BRAKE SENSOR TO SEE IF THAT WORKED. I PICKED UP THE CAR AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHEN THE ISSUE PRESENTED ITSELF AGAIN. THEY RECORDED MORE DATA TO SEND TO NISSAN.

I BROKE THE WINDSHIELD TO COME OUT AND WITH THE HELP FROM PASSERSBY; I COULD SAFELY BRING MY WIFE AND 3 YEAR OLD OUT OF THE CAR.

MOVED CAR BACK INTO GARAGE AND PUT BLOCKS BEHIND THE TIRES. AT THAT POINT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A ONE TIME EVENT.  APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER I RAN AN ERRAND, PUT CAR IN PARK (ON LEVEL GROUND), GOT OUT OF CAR AND IT STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS AGAIN.

IT STAYED THAT WAY FOR ABOUT 5 MILES,WE COULD SLOW DOWN BUT THE RPM'S WERE STILL STUCK AT 6500 AND THE ENGINE WAS MAKING A HORRIBLE SOUND,  THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AND SEVERAL TIMES WE HAD TO RIDE THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. WHEN WE FINALLY REACHED THE ROAD WE LIVE OFF OF MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND TURN WHILE TURNING THE AWFUL NOISE GOT A LITTLE LOWER BUT A NEW NOISE WAS HEARD, A WHINING SOUND. AFTER TURNING, THE CAR LOST ALL GAS, NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN THE ACCELERATOR WAS PUSHED AND THEN FINALLY IT STARTED TO GO AGAIN. WE ARRIVED AT OUR HOME MY HUSBAND OPENED THE HOOD AND TOLD ME TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR A LITTLE AND THEN HE SAW SMALL PUFFS OF SMOKE. I SMELLED SOMETHING LIKE BURNING RUBBER WHILE SITTING IN THE DRIVERS SEAT AND MY HUSBAND SAID HE SMELLED SOMETHING SWEET UNDER THE HOOD.  THIS CAR WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW ON JANUARY 4TH, 2014, IT HAD 25 MILES WHEN PURCHASED. THE MILEAGE ON JANUARY 11TH WAS AROUND 500. THIS IS A DANGEROUS VEHICLE, I AM WAITING ON THE DEALERSHIP TO CALL AND LET ME KNOW WHAT THEY FIND.  *TR",
