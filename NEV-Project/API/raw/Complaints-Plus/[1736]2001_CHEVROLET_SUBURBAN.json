THE ONE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS EARLIER HIS BRAKE LINES ALSO BROKE ON HIS SUBURBAN COMING UP TO A RED LIGHT AND HE HAD TO DRIVE ON THE BIRM TO AVOID REAR ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF HIM. HE HAD TO REPLACE ALL OF HIS SUBURBANS BRAKE LINES.I LIVE IN WESTERN PA AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING HERE FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS WITH MANY DIFFERENT VEHICLES DURING THAT TIME BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD BRAKE LINES RUST AND BREAK LIKE THIS. FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN READING, THIS MUST BE FROM FAULTY BRAKE LINE MATERIAL, NONE OF MY MANY OTHER VEHICLES HAVE EVER HAD THIS HAPPEN SO CHEVY CANNOT JUST BLAME IT ON LIVING IN A SNOW/ROAD SALT AREA.  *** I PLAN ON GOING WITH A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER WHEN I GET MY NEXT SUV.  *TR",

I CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY PROBLEM COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO WEAR AND TEAR.

NO WARNING LIGHT EVER CAME ON SO I WENT TO CHECK THE RUBBER HOSES AND BRAKE LINES UNDER THE TRUCK FINDING A BRAKE FLUID DRIPPING FROM THE AREA UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT, CLOSE TO A BIG RUBBER \" DOUGHNUT \" ( CHASSIS MOUNT ).

A CURSORY CHECK ON THE INTERNET REVEALS THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD AND VERY WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM FOR OWNERS OF SIMILAR GM VEHICLES.   VISITS TO TWO SEPARATE GM DEALERSHIPS IN DALLAS CONFIRM THAT THE DEALERS KNOW OF THIS AS A WIDESPREAD AND WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM AS WELL.  ODDLY, THE NHTSA HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THIS VEHICLE SAFETY DEFECT AT THE REQUEST OF THE NORTH CAROLINA CONSUMER COUNCIL BACK IN 2005, YET THE NHTSA DECIDED AT THE TIME THAT THIS DEFECT DID NOT WARRANT A SAFETY RECALL.  THE SUMMARY CONCLUDES THAT FOR AUTO-TRANSMISSION-EQUIPPED VEHICLES, THE PRESENCE OF A \"PARK PAWL\" SERVES AS SUFFICIENT HOLDING POWER FOR THESE VEHICLES AND THEREFORE THE APPEAL FOR A SAFETY RECALL WAS DENIED.   THERE IS AT LEAST ONE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS CONCLUSION -- NO STATE IS GOING TO ALLOW A VEHICLE WITHOUT A WORKING PARKING BRAKE TO PASS A STATE SAFETY INSPECTION.  I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND, AT LEAST IN TEXAS I DO.  IT OF COURSE MAKES NO SENSE FOR THE NHTSA TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF VEHICLE SAFETY THAN THE CONSTITUENT STATES DO.  EITHER THIS IS AN ISSUE WORTHY OF A NATIONAL SAFETY RECALL, OR THE LACK OF A WORKING PARKING BRAKE SHOULD NOT SERVE AS A VEHICLE FOR FAILURE OF A STATE SAFETY INSPECTION.  *TR",

I TALKED TO A NUMBER OF MECHANICS AND THEY SAID THAT THE PROBLEM IS NORMALLY WITH A RELAY IN THE EHCU AND THIS CAUSES THE MOTOR TO RUN NON-STOP.  THEY SAID THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM FOR 1999 + CHEVROLET SILVERADO, GMC SIERRA, AND THE 2000 + CHEVROLET SUBURBAN/TAHOE AND THE GMC YUKON/YUKON XL.  THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS PROBABLY A RECALL ON THEM BUT APPARENTLY THERE IS NOT.      THE PART IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE DEALER AND COSTS APPROXIMATELY $950.  IT TAKES ALMOST TWO HOURS OF LABOR TO INSTALL IT SO THE REPAIR COSTS ABOUT $1150.  THE SUBURBAN IS NOW IN THE SHOP BEING REPAIRED.      THE CAR ONLY HAS 51,000 MILES AND THIS MODULE SHOULD NOT FAIL WITH SUCH LOW MILES AND IT SHOULD NOT COST NEARLY THIS MUCH TO REPAIR.  *NM",

AS I APPROACHED MY DRIVEWAY FROM THE STREET, I BEGAN BRAKING WITH THE INTENTION OF PARKING IN THE DRIVEWAY IN FRONT OF MY GARAGE; HOWEVER, RATHER THAN SIMPLY SLOWING DOWN, MY BRAKES INSTEAD MADE A STRANGE VIBRATION (SOUND AND MOVEMENT), AND THE BRAKES APPEARED TO MALFUNCTION.  I ATTEMPTED TO PUMP MY BRAKES, BUT THE \"VIBRATIONS\" CONTINUED AND MY TRUCK SEEMED TO \"SLIDE\", EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOW PRESSING ON MY BRAKE PEDAL WITH ALL MY MIGHT.  MY TRUCK OVERSHOT MY DRIVEWAY PARKING SPOT, AND CRASHED INTO MY GARAGE DOOR.  THE VEHICLE DESTROYED THE GARAGE DOOR, AND THERE WAS FRONT END DAMAGE TO MY BUMPER, HOOD, GRILL AND WINDSHIELD.

HOWEVER, I DID NOT DRIVE THE TRUCK UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER, WHEN I  DROVE ON SUNDAY, JULY 24TH, AT WHICH TIME THE BRAKE \"VIBRATIONS\" RE-OCCURRED AS I PULLED INTO A TURN LANE INTO A SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP, AND AFTER THEIR BRAKE INSPECTION, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ABS WHEEL SPEED SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, WHICH WOULD BE AT NO COST BECAUSE IT WAS \"UNDER WARRENTY\", AND THAT THEY ALSO WANTED TO REPLACE MY REAR ROTORS, AT A COST OF OVER $800.

COMPONENT : SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC:ANTILOCK   DATE INVESTIGATION OPENED : APRIL 28, 2005   DATE INVESTIGATION CLOSED : OPEN   SUMMARY:   IN NOVEMBER 2004, GM NOTIFIED ODI THAT IT WAS RECALLING APPROXIMATELY 150,000 MODEL YEAR 1999-2002 C/K MODEL TRUCKS IN EASTERN CANADA TO CORRECT A CONDITION IN THE ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) THAT MAY RESULT IN UNWANTED ABS ACTIVATION AND INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCES DURING LOW-SPEED BRAKE APPLICATIONS. GM INDICATED THAT THE CONDITION CAN OCCUR IF CORROSION FORMS UNDER THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR AND MOVES THE SENSOR AWAY FROM THE INTEGRAL SPEED-SENSOR TOOTHED RING. THE CONDITION DOES NOT SET ANY ABS CODES NOR DOES IT ILLUMINATE THE ABS WARNING LAMP. GM'S RECALL PROCEDURE INVOLVED REMOVING THE WHEEL SPEED SENSORS, CLEANING THE SENSOR MOUNTING SURFACES ON THE BEARINGS, APPLYING ZINC-X TO THE CLEANED SURFACES, GREASING THE MOUNTING SURFACES, REINSTALLING THE SPEED SENSORS, AND VERIFYING THAT THE WHEEL SPEED SIGNAL OUTPUT VOLTAGES WERE WITHIN SPECIFICATION. GM REPORTED A FAILURE RATE OF 0.32 INCIDENTS PER THOUSAND VEHICLES IN THE VEHICLES COVERED BY THE RECALL IN CANADA. GM INDICATED THAT THE CORRESPONDING RATE IN U.S. CORROSION STATES WAS 0.03 IPTV AND THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT EXPERIENCE. ODI HAS RECEIVED 120 COMPLAINTS INVOLVING MY 1999-2002 C/K TRUCKS IN U.S. SALT BELT STATES, WHICH APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE DEFECT CONDITION ADDRESSED BY GM'S SAFETY RECALL IN CANADA. TWENTY-TWO OF THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT A CRASH OCCURRED, INCLUDING ONE THAT INVOLVED 6 VEHICLES AND RESULTED IN 4 INJURIES. A PRELIMINARY EVALUATION HAS BEEN OPENED TO ASSESS THE INCIDENT FREQUENCY AND TREND ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR CONDITION IN THE UNITED STATES.",

MY REASON FOR WRITING IS THAT THE GAS TANK SPLIT FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  SINCE NOTHING STRUCK THE TANK TO CAUSE THE SPLIT, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS UNUSUAL AND WORTHY OF NOTE.

THE PEDAL WOULD DEPRESS ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ROLL. THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCY PARKING BRAKE HAD CAUSED PREMATURE WEAR ON THE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS. THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE RESULT OF THE BODY STYLE CHANGE IN 2000. THE NEW DESIGN OF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PLACED IT IN CONTACT WITH THE ROTORS WHICH CAUSES PREMATURE WEAR.    THIS IS NOT A REPAIR THAT IS COVERED UNDER THE 36 MONTH/36,000 MILE BUMPER-TO-BUMPER WARRANTY. DESPITE THAT, THE DEALER REPLACED THE PADS AND ROTORS AT NO CHARGE. I AM STILL NOT CLEAR AS TO WHY, BUT THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE EXPENSE OF THE REPAIR IF THE VEHICLE HAS OVER 30,000 MILES. I'M LED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN ITEM, THAT DUE TO THE NUMBER OF REPORTED OCCURRENCES, THAT GM IS REPAIRING UNDER WARRANTY UP TO 30,000 MILES. I CONSIDER MYSELF FORTUNATE IN THAT I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE TO THEM AT 29,700 MILES.     AS A SIDE NOTE, I WILL POINT OUT THAT WHEN THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW FROM HUFFINES CHEVROLET, THE PARKING PEDAL WOULD DEPRESS ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. MY WIFE AND I BOTH FOUND THAT TO BE ODD. WE ALWAYS USE THE PARKING BRAKE AND WE NEVER HAD ONE OPERATE IN THAT FASHION. BUT THE DEALER SAID THAT WAS NORMAL AND THAT BRAKE WAS HOLDING THE VEHICLE.    THE EXISTENCE OF A POTENTIAL EMERGENCY BRAKE MECHANISM DEFECT IS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CASE FOR ALL OWNERS OF THE 2000-2004 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN. MANY HOUSEHOLDS OWN AND OPERATE THESE VEHICLES AND SUCH A DEFECT PUTS OUR WIVES AND CHILDREN AT RISK. I RECOMMEND, WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE, THAT NHTSA CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE.  *AK",

ON 3/10/2003 I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO LONE STAR CHEVROLET FOR ITS 50K MILE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, EXCEPT FOR A  SQUEALING FROM THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN THE BREAKS WERE APPLIED.  I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE BRAKES.  ON THEIR FIRST CALL, THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE MECHANIC FOUND THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS TO BE GLAZED OVER, CAUSING THE NOISE.  I TOLD THEM TO FIX IT, A STANDARD WEAR REPAIR ITEM.  LATER, THE REPRESENTATIVE CALLED AGAIN TO SAY THE MECHANIC FOUND THE EMERGENCY BRAKES WERE BROKEN,NOT HOLDING AGAINST THE DRUM, WHICH CAUSED, THE CAR TO BE UNSAFE TO THE POINT IT WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION.  WHEN I ASKED HOW THAT COULD BE SINCE I HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ANY DIFFICULTY IN STOPPING VEHICLE, HE SAID THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS A TOTALLY SEPARATE SYSTEM FROM THE REGULAR BRAKES.  I POINTED OUT SEVERAL FACTS TO HIM:  1)I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW AND HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON TO DRIVE THE CAR EXCEPT WHEN IT WAS IN THEIR SHOP FOR REPAIRS.   2)I HAVE NEVER (NOT ONCE) ACTIVATED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON THE VEHICLE AND I ALWAYS CHECK TO MAKE CERTAIN ITS NOT ON WHEN ITS RETURNED FROM REPAIRS.  3)THE CAR PASSED ITS ANNUAL INSPECTION DURING 12/2002 WITH THE INSPECTION DONE BY THEIR FACILITY.  THERE WAS NO MENTION ABOUT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE NOT WORKING THEN.  IN LIGHT OF THESE ISSUES, I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE TO EXPLAIN HOW A PART THAT HAS NEVER BEEN ACTIVATED GOT A DRUM THAT IS SO BADLY SCORED AND WORN THAT IT NO LONGER WORKS AND WHY THE PROBLEM WASN'T NOTICED DURING DECEMBER.  HE THEN SAID NORMAL ROAD VIBRATIONS CAN CAUSE THE PARTS TO SLIP OUT OF ALIGNMENT CAUSING THE DAMAGE AT ANY TIME, AND IT WAS NOT DAMAGED DURING DECEMBER.

AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF REVIEW AND INVESTIGATIONS, GM SAID THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS MATERIAL DEFECT. THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS HOW MANY 2001 CHEVY SUBURBAN WAS AFFECTED BY THIS MATERIAL   DEFECT. ALSO, GM REPRESENTATIVE WAS RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE ME A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS  CONDUCTED BY THEIR DESIGN ENGINEERS.   THE PARKING PAWL MECHANISM FAILURE CANNOT BE DETECTED EASILY BY AN AVERAGE PERSON, UNLESS A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED OR AN ACCIDENT WILL OCCURRED.   ALSO, MY 2001 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN WAS DISCOVERED BY GM AUTHORIZED SERVICE SHOP THAT   THE EMERGENCY PARKING BRAKE WAS HAVING A PREMATURE WEARING ON THE BRAKE PADS.  THIS REALLY A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CASE FOR ALL 2001 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN FOR  HAVING A POTENTIAL EMERGENCY BRAKE PAD AND PARKING PAWL MECHANISM DEFECT.  I AM HIGHLY SUGGESTING THIS OFFICE TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION TO AVOID A SIMILAR FATE   WITH FIRESTONE CASE. BECAUSE I SUSPECT GM IS COVERING UP THIS DEFECT TO AVOID MASSIVE RECALLS ON ALL 2001 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN.   *JB",

IN THE 2002 EVENT, I EXPERIENCED A HIGH PITCH WHINING AND VIBRATIONS IN THE STEERING, AS WELL AS THE BRAKE PEDAL.  IN EFFECTING THIS REPAIR, CHEVROLET REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP.   DURING THE LATTER PART OF NOVEMBER 2002, THE HIGH PITCH WHINING AND VIBRATION RETURNED.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BILL SEIDLE'S CHEVROLET IN CLERMONT, FL IN NOVEMBER OF  2002, AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE STEERING OR BRAKING  SYSTEM.    UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE WRONG.  ON TUESDAY EVENING, 2/4/2003, WHILE DRIVING  WITH MY SEVEN YEAR OLD, THE SAME HIGH PITCH WHINING, AND PULSING IN THE BRAKE  PEDAL RETURNED.  THIS TIME IT RESULTED IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND  BRAKES WHILE EXITING A LOCAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN THE ORLANDO AREA.  FORTUNATELY, I  WAS DRIVING AS IT TOOK QUITE A BIT OF STRENGTH, TO STEER AND STOP THE VEHICLE  AFTER THE LOSS OF THE POWER ASSIST SYSTEM.

ALSO NOTICED THAT OVER TIME THE PARKING BRAKE WOULD FAIL TO HOLD THE VEHICLE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, AND AROUND 14000 MILES, QUIT ALTOGETHER.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO DEALER AND WAS ADVICED THIS PROBLEM WAS COMMON WITH THE NEW SUBURBAN BODY STYLE (2000).  SERVICE ADVISOR SAID WOULD HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE PARKING BRAKE UNIT TO SEE IF PADS NEEDED ADJUSTMENT OR REPLACEMENT AND MORE THAN LIKELY WOULD BE NEEDING REPLACEMENT AND THUS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. I TOLD HIM THIS WAS HAPPENING FROM THE BEGINNING AND HE SAID THE PADS FOR THE PARKING BRAKE ON THE NEW BODY STYLES WERE VERY SMALL AND WORE OUT VERY QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF USED ON AN INCLINE OR DRIVEN WITH PARKING BRAKES APPLIED.  THIS BEING THE CASE, IT DID NOT SEEM COST EFFECTIVE TO BOTHER REPLACING THE PADS AS HE WAS GOING TO CHARGE ME ABOUT $150.   IS THIS A DESIGN DEFECT OR AN INTENTIONAL SCHEME TO RIP CUSTOMERS OFF WITH FREQUENT BRAKE PAD CHANGES?*AK",

THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT AN INCLUDED FEATURE IN THE NEW 2001 SUBURBANS. I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE A NOT PROPERLY CLOSED DOOR IN A FAMILY VEHICLE SUCH AS A SUBURBAN COULD VERY EASILY RESULT IN THE DOOR OPEING AT HIGH SPEEDS OR AROUND A TIGHT CORNER OR IN A ACCIDENT WITH THE END RESULT BEING A CHILD BEING THROWN FROM THE CAR. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THIS 'DOOR AJAR'  FEATURE (PRETTY STANDARD NOW ON ALL CARS FOR MANY YEARS) MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY BEEN LEFT OFF MANY SUBURBANS OR WAS OVERLOOKED IN THE DESIGN OF THE SUBURBANS, BOTH OF WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN GM RECALLING THE AFFECTED CARS TO PUT IN THE 'DOOR AJAR' WARNING. LASTLY, THIS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE GMX YUKON & YUKON XL VEHICLES AS THEY ARE IDENTICAL COUSINS TO THE CHEVROLET SUBURBANS.
