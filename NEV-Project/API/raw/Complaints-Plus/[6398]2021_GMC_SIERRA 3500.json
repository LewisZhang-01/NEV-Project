The heater turns high or the heater won\u2019t work; and there are issues with the connector.02/24/22: My truck has 16,000 approx. miles. The check engine light came on and displayed message that I had so many miles until truck would be restricted to 65MPH.  I took my truck into Kendall dealership in Nampa, Idaho and was told there was myself and another person who had the same issue. A couple weeks go by and I call the dealership back and was told that I was 5th in line and there were 20 behind me.  I was told that there were 11,000 parts already spoken for and 6,000 parts on backorder. I was one of the backorder individuals.  I was also told that they do not have a ETA on when they would receive parts and that parts show up unexpected.    They told me that I would have to contact GM customer service for assistance.  The dealer called me back March 31st to see if I got my camper moved and how much it cost to move.  They told me the dealership would cover one month truck payment and would like me to send in my loan payment statement. I asked for clarification as I didn\u2019t know how I could have been 2nd person and the other day he said I was fifth in line.  He said that there are at least 2-3 persons for service technician at dealership.  Only 2 got fixed in the last 2 months.  I asked if the new part going in will have the same issue or will be a re-designed part that fixes the issue.  Dealer said the same part.  GM is working on a re-design part and not ready for manufacturing.  I asked why this wasn\u2019t on a recall and he said no because it would bring people in that don\u2019t need it replaced because their part is still working, and that GM doesn\u2019t have a re-designed part to fix the issue.  Gortsema Motors in Grangeville, Idaho a friend brought in their 2018 Chevydiesel truck (with 87,000 miles) for the same issue. Dealer said they have many cases.",

        "summary": "Problem: Unable to shift transmission from D to another position like R, P, N due to snow/slush being on shifter. I travel on Idaho state highways and County roads that are plowed.  In February, I traveled state highway 14.  Road conditions were plowed snow roads, broken snow floor, slush and pavement without slush or snow.  I had a passenger with me on this trip from Elk City, Idaho to Grangeville, Idaho via SH-14.  When I pulled into my storage unit, I could not shift from D to P or N or R.  I could only drive forward.  The temperature in Grangeville was mid 40s. I did not have any tremendous snow build up on the under carriage or wheel wells.  I drove to the dealer Gortsema Motors and their service technician said that I needed to go to a car wash and blow out the snow buildup next to the transmission linkage shifter.  When I pulled into the car wash, I still could not shift the transmission.  My passenger got out and used the water to push out the snow buildup around the linkage shifter.  Then I was able to shift between all gears P, R, N, D.  This is a big concern because this should not have happened.  This is a major problem in the winter and had there not been a car wash to blow out the snow/slush, I would not be able to turn the truck off or restart the diesel truck in gear.  There needs to be a protective shield around the shifter so that snow/slush does not get up into area and cause the shifter to not shift.",

But GM is releasing absolute trash lately and I fear that some poor family will load up, trusting these vehicles, and be badly injured or killed.
