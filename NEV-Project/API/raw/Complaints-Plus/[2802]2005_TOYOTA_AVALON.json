I PUT TWO FEET ON THE BRAKE AND PRESSED AS HARD AS I COULD. THE CAR DID STOP. THE CAR WAS TOWED BY AAA TO A TOYOTA DEALER IN FORT SMITH, AR (WHERE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED). I BOUGHT THE CAR AT MOLLE TOYOTA IN KC, MO WHERE I LIVE (OVERLAND PARK, KS). THE INSURANCE ADJUSTOR CAME THAT DAY TO CHECK THE DAMAGE. HE SAID AN INVESTIGATOR WOULD BE OUT TO CHECK IT THE \"CAUSE OF IMPACT\". AS OF NOW, THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. MY INSURANCE COMPANY KEEPS TELLING ME TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO KC FOR REPAIRS AND I TOLD THEM I WILL NOT DRIVE AN UNSAFE CAR. I WILL NOT TOUCH THE CAR UNTIL SOMEONE INVESTIGATES THE REASON FOR THE ACCELERATION. I HAVE CALLED MY DEALER, WHO HAS BEEN WONDERFUL; TOYOTA CORPORATE WHO HAS BEEN HORRIBLE (THE FIRST THING \"BARBARA\" SAID TO ME WAS \"WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?\") SHE RELUCTANTLY SAID SHE WOULD CHECK IT OUT. SHE CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER IN FORT SMITH AND TOLD HIM THAT TOYOTA INSPECTORS WOULD BE OUT WITHIN 10 DAYS BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHEN. I CALLED THE HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SAFETY DEPT. WHO SAID THEY DIDN'T DEAL WITH THAT AND TO CALL MY KS ATTORNEY GENERAL. I CALLED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO TOLD ME TO EMAIL THIS ADDRESS. SO . . . STATUS: MY CAR IS STILL IN FORT SMITH, AR ON A TOYOTA LOT AND NOBODY WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED OR HELP ME WITH MY NEXT STEPS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE BELIEVED THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED AFTER THE RECALL FIX. FINALLY, IT APPEARS THAT OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.

PUT 4-5 QUARTS OF OIL AND DROVE 20 MILES AND PARKED. AFTER STARTING THE CAR, SAW A HUGE OIL PUDDLE UNDER THE ENGINE. NEXT MORNING TOWED TO TOYOTA MECHANIC WHO MENTIONED THE ABOVE VVTI RUBBER HOSE LEAKAGE PROBLEM IN BANK 2 (TOP ONE). THE METAL CLIPS CONNECTING THE RUBBER HOSE TO THE OIL METAL TUBE ON BANK 2 ERODE THE RUBBER PORTION WITH TIME, MAKING A SMALL PINHOLE LEAK AT FIRST WHICH CAN LEAD TO A CRACK SUDDENLY UNDER HIGH PRESSURE. GOOGLING IT I FOUND THAT IT IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE V6 ENGINES ON 2005 AVALONS AND OTHER TOYOTA CARS, SUCH AS, RAV4. TOYOTA HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ON IT, BUT IT NEVER WARNED OWNERS LIKE ME ABOUT IT.THROUGH A PERSONAL LETTER. SOME PEOPLE HAD THEIR ENGINE SEIZED DUE TO IT, MINE DID NOT. BUT WORSE WAS IN STORE FOR ME. AFTER THE RUBBER HOSE WAS REPLACED BY ANOTHER SIMILAR RUBBER HOSE, I STARTED NOTICING IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS THAT THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING A GRINDING NOISE WHEN I STARTED IT COLD - AFTER 10-12 HOURS OF OVERNIGHT PARKING, SAY, 75% OF THE TIME, BUT THE NOISE DIED AWAY AFTER 30 SECONDS OR SO; NO NOISE IF WARM. ALSO, A GROWLING NOISE WAS HEARD WHEN GOING UP SMALL INDOOR GRADIENTS LIKE PARKING LOTS. MECHANIC SAID THAT THE BOLTS ON THE TIMING GEAR IN BOTH BANK 2 AND BANK 1 HAD BECOME LOOSE, TWO BOLTS WERE OUT IN THE GEAR BOX WITH ONE BROKEN - ALL CAUSED DURING THE OIL LEAKAGE. I WAS LUCKY MY ENGINE HAD NEVER SEIZED DUE TO IT. HE HAD TO REPLACE ALL PARTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, NAMELY, TIMING GEARS, CAM-SHAFTS, CAMS, TENSIONER RING, ETC. ALSO, REPLACED THE RUBBER HOSE WITH AN ALL-METAL OIL TUBE, AS THAT WAS WHAT TOYOTA HAD ON ITS LEXUS ES350, BUT THIS ONLY DUE TO MY INSISTENCE. RUBBER HOSE CAN LEAK AGAIN.

LOOKING FOR A PARKING SPACE,  SLOWED VEHICLE TO A CRAWL WHILE SCANNING THE  LOT & THEN TURNED SLOWLY ABOUT 45 DEGREES TO DRIFT INTO AN AVAILABLE  SPACE WHEN SUDDENLY THE VEHICLE  LURCHED FORWARD  OUT OF CONTROL RAMMING  THE PARKED VEHICLE FACING THE SPACE I WAS IN. I REMEMBER A LOUD NOISE - WHICH  WAS THE ENGINE ACCELERATING: AN UNFAMILIAR SOUND WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS JUST ABOUT STOPPED. THEN,  THE NOISE OF THE CRASH -  ABOUT 6 FT  IN FRONT OF THE AVALON AT THE TIME OF THE NOISE & LURCH. THE IMPACT STOPPED THE CAR. I PUT IT IN REVERSE & BACKED AWAY, THEN TURNED OFF THE IGNITION. MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR BY MISTAKE AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE BRAKE WHILE DRIFTING DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE OPEN SPACE - THERE HAD BEEN NO ACCELERATION WHILE IN THAT AISLE. TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP IN THE SPACE I WOULD  HAVE HAD TO APPLY ONLY THE   SLIGHTEST PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE ; THEREFORE, IF I HAD TOUCHED THE ACCELERATOR BY MISTAKE I WOULD HAVE NOT DONE SO WITH ENOUGH PRESSURE TO CAUSE THE WILD ACCELERATION. WITH MY FOOT ABOVE THE BRAKE IN THAT INSTANT WHEN I TOUCHED THE BRAKE TO STOP THE LURCH IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE SPEED OF THE CAR  BEFORE IMPACT: THERE WAS NOT ANY HESITATION IN THE ENGINE.  NO DAMAGE TO THE OTHER VEHICLE. THE AVALON SUSTAINED SOME BUMPER DAMAGE AND A BENT HOOD - DRIVABLE, BUT I REFUSED TO DRIVE IT.  WHILE WAITING  FOR A TOW TRUCK I DROVE  TO THE EMPTY LOT  BEHIND THE STORES AND TRIED TO REPEAT THE EVENT, UNSUCCESSFULLY. I DISCOVERED THAT IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THAT QUICKLY, I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE PUSHED THE ACCELERATOR TO THE FLOOR - AN IMPOSSIBILITY AT THE 0 MILES PER HOUR I WAS DRIFTING INTO POSITION IN THE PARKING SPACE. THE CAR ACCELERATED SUDDENLY AND UNINTENTIONAL THROUGH NO ACTION ON MY PART. THE TOYOTA DEALER FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  *TR",

WHILE I WAS VERY GLAD THE OTHER MECHANIC CAUGHT THE MISTAKE,HE SAID NO ONE HAD WRITTEN ON MY PAPERWORK THAT THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE,I DID INDEED DRIVE A DANGEROUS CAR THAT WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE FOR 2 WEEKS. WHILE IF THIS WAS A USED CAR,I PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE WRITING THIS,BUT IT WAS A BRAND NEW CAR! WHAT IF SOMETHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME WHILE DRIVING PRIOR TO ME TAKING IT IN,AND -GOD FORBID-THE OTHER MECHANIC DID NOT CATCH THE MISTAKE-  I THOUGHT WHEN WE BOUGHT NEW CARS THEY ARE TO BE SAFE TO DRIVE!",
