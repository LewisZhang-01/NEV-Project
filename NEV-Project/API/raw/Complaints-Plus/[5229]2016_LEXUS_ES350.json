Seeing no other vehicles, feeling nothing wrong with the tires, or broken mirrors, I cracked open the moon roof slightly and noticed shattered glass.  Fortunately, we had the interior moon roof flap of the vehicle closed which prevented the shards from falling on us.  There was no warning that this would happen.  As it is a holiday, I am awaiting a response from both the insurance company and the dealership.  You will note the \"upward\" explosion that would not be typical of an object coming from the road.
