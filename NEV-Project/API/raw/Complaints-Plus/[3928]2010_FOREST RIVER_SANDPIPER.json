WE CUT OUR TRIP SHORT AND IMMEDIATELY CAME HOME.  I ATTEMPTED TO HAVE FOREST RIVER AUTHORIZE A REPAIR LOCALLY, BUT THEY WANTED ME TO RETURN TO THE POINT OF PURCHASE (5 HOURS AWAY).  WE HAD ANOTHER TRIP PLANNED THE FOLLOWING WEEK SO I LOOKED AT THE PROBLEM.  THE 50 AMP SOCKET HOUSING WAS INSTALLED 180 DEGREES REVERSE (EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF A MOLDED KEYWAY IN THE HOUSING).  IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE THE SOCKET, AFTER WIRING IT, IN THAT MANNER, IT HAD TO BE FORCED TOGETHER.  AS A RESULT THE LOCKDOWN FOR THE WIRING CAUSED IT TO PULL AWAY FROM THE SET SCREW AND GROUND TO THE NEUTRAL WIRE.  THIS CAUSED A SMALL FIRE WHICH BURNED THROUGH THE HOUSING AND LAND LINE CABLE.  ALL OF THESE PIECES HAD TO BE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS NEGLIGENCE COULD ONLY HAVE OCCURRED FROM INITIAL ASSEMBLY AT THE FACTORY.   *JS",
