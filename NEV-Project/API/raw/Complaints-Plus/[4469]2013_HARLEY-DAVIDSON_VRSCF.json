NO ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BUT I KNOW OF OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN IN NEAR MISS ACCIDENTS DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE REAR BRAKE. THE FRONT BRAKE IS STILL ACTIVE AND WAS USED TO BRING THE MOTORCYCLE TO A HALT.

THE FIRST PHOTO SHOWS THE GENERAL AREA WHILE THE SECOND ZOOMS IN TO SHOW THE ABRADED LINE (THIS LINE IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE RADIATOR HOSE AND THE FRAME - JUST BELOW THE ZIP TIE).
