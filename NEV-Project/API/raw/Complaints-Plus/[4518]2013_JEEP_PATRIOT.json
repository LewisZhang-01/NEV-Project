This has happened to a lot of autos in the Chrysler family. Go to any Chrysler auto forum, I guarantee this will be something that has happened to 1 if not more people. Just google \"broken cvt fluid filler tube\" and it will all come up. This has to be a manufacture defect. Happening to too many people. They break at the same place, the bracket, no warning light indicator....nothing! It is usually found when something else is being done under the hood, then you see the broken piece just laying there. Thanking the Lord you and your family are ok, because had this piece of metal tubing broke off and went flying anything could have happened. This situation has not been confirmed by a dealer or independent service center nor has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance rep. I am providing pictures of the piece that broke off. I bought the vehicle used in July 2021, have had my vehicle serviced twice and noone has ever noticed the broken tube, I had to replace my battery in October 2021never noticed the broken piece. Only until I personally replaced the Electronic Throttle Body did I find the broken tube. And that was done yesterday Feb 19, 2022.",

I QUICKLY EXITED FROM THE LOT TO GET THE VEHICLE AWAY FROM THE STORE AND FUEL PUMPS. I DIDN'T BUY FUEL AT THAT VISIT.  THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT AROUND THE CORNER HAS AN OPEN LOT, SO I HAD AN OFFICER COME OUT AND A FIREMAN RELATIVE STOP IN TO MAKE SURE THE VEHICLE WASN'T GOING TO COMBUST. LEFT THE PATRIOT SIT AND HAD AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC CHECK IT OUT THE FOLLOWING DAY. HE DID NOT FIND ANYTHING UPON LETTING THE VEHICLE RUN AND HE TIGHTENED UP THE VENT TUBE OR FUEL FILLER NECK. THIS WAS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. TONIGHT, WITH THE TANK AT APPROXIMATELY 1/2 FULL, I MADE THE SAME 3 MILE TRIP, USING DEFROST AND FAN, SMELLED RAW FUEL AND BY THE TIME I GOT INTO THE STORE MY THROAT AND LIPS WERE BURNING, LIGHTHEADED AND THINGS LOOKED A LITTLE HAZY. DROVE HOME WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN AND WILL APPARENTLY HAVE TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CHECKED OUT AGAIN. NOTICED THE JEEP DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE GREAT ACCELERATION ON THE DRIVE IN. MILEAGE IS NOW MID 40K RANGE. FUEL SMELL COMING OUT IS WICKED AND TOXIC. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BRAND NEW AT THE END OF 2012. LIGHT DRIVING WITH A DAILY 6MILE COMMUTE FOR WORK. THIS IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS ON SEVERAL LEVELS. I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING CHILDREN AND PETS IN THE VEHICLE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. COULD THIS BE A CONTINUATION OF THE 2012 FUEL TANK PRODUCTION PROBLEM OF THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL?",

        "summary": "THE PATRIOT CVT TRANSMISSION IS FAULTY AND SUBJECT TO EARLY TRANSMISSION FAILURE. AROUND 90,000 MILES, MY TRANSMISSION BEGAN OVERHEATING. THIS HAPPENS WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY GOING AN AVERAGE OF 65-70MPH FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, TRANSMISSION OVERHEAT WARNING LIGHT TURNS ON AND CAR BEGINS TO LOSE POWER. IT'S NECESSARY TO PULL OVER AND WAIT FOR COOLDOWN WITH CAR TURNED OFF FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES- WHICH IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DO ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY, SOMETIMES AT NIGHT. JEEP STATES THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN UNLESS YOU ARE TOWING OR THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE IS EXCEEDINGLY HOT. MY PATRIOT DOES THIS EVERY TIME I TAKE A TRIP THAT REQUIRES AN HOUR OR MORE OF HIGHWAY DRIVING, REGARDLESS OF TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT I DO NOT TOW ANYTHING EVER. TRANSMISSION WHINES LOUDLY IN THE PROCESS AND THE CAR WILL SLOWLY LOSE ACCELERATION POWER RIGHT BEFORE THE OVERHEAT LIGHT TURNS ON. IT'S A SCARY EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME.   I'VE TAKEN MY JEEP INTO THE DEALERSHIP UNDER WARRANTY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, HOWEVER- THEIR SOLUTION OF CHANGING OUT SOME VALVES DID NOT PROVE TO BE EFFECTIVE AS THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. INTERSTINGLY ENOUGH, JEEP CEASED USING THE CVT TRANSMISSION IN 2014 AFTER ONLY 2 YEARS- IM ASSUMING THIS PROBLEM HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.",

THIS PAST SATURDAY I TOOK A 2 1/2 HOUR TRIP TO NORTH CAROLINA FROM VIRGINIA. ON THE WAY THERE WE STOPPED QUITE A BIT AND HAD NO ISSUES. ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON I STARTED BACK TOWARD VIRGINIA AND FELT THE SAME SHUTTER I FELT DAYS BEFORE AND THE WHINING PERSISTED. SINCE A FRIEND OF MINE WAS FOLLOWING ME BACK TO VIRGINIA I DECIDED TO DRIVE IT HOME. AN HOUR AND A HALF INTO THE DRIVE THE TRANSMISSION TEMPERATURE GAGE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY SLOWED DOWN ON A BUSY HIGHWAY. LUCKILY I MADE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEFORE THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUT OFF. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND SO FAR I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS NORMAL. I'M EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED IF THAT IS THE CASE BECAUSE THAT IS A BIG SAFETY RISK AND I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN. THE LAST THING I NEED IS TO BE STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN THE BLAZING HEAT (LIKE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON SATURDAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY FRIEND) WITH A 2 AND 4 YEAR OLD. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY REQUESTED A RECALL TO FIX THE ISSUE. IT ALSO FRUSTRATES ME THAT, AT THE VERY MINIMUM, I WILL HAVE A BILL FOR A $90 DIAGNOSTIC FEE FROM THE DEALERSHIP FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN FIXED BY JEEP.",
