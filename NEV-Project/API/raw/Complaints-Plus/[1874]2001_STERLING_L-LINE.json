        "summary": "2001 STERLING LT9513 PASSENGER SIDE DASHBOARD AND FUSE PANEL SUPPORTS BREAKING LOOSE RESULTING IN ELECTRICAL SHORTS.     DRIVING ON INTERSTATE 76 EAST BOUND APROX. 2 MILES FROM THE RT. 8 INTERCHANGE WHEN WE HIT A \" POT HOLE \" A LARGE SNAP SOUND FOLLOWED BUT THE LOSE OF MY HEAD LIGHTS AND HEATER.  I EXITED THE FREEWAY AND INSPECTED THE FUSE PANEL. THE PANEL HAD SNAPPED OUT OF PLACE AND ALONG WITH THAT THE SUPPORTS HOLDING THE DASH BOARD HAD ALSO BROKE. THE NEXT DAY I CALLED A FEW BUSINESSES THAT I DEAL WITH AND ASKED IF THEY EVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS. I CALLED 5 BUSINESSES THAT OWNED THE SAME MODEL TRUCK RANGING FROM 1999-2006 THEY ALSO HAD  SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  THE DASH BOARDS IN ALL 5 TRUCKS HAD BROKE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THE ESTIMATED COST TO FIX THIS IS 2500 $  AND IF NOT FIXED CAN LEAVE A TRUCK WITH OUT POWER GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. THE ONLY THING THE TRUCKS HAVE IN COMMON IS THE MANUFACTURE AND THAT IS WHY I AM FILLING THIS COMPLAINT, OTHERS WILL FOLLOW NOW THAT THIS SEEMS MORE LIKE \" BAD DESIGN\" RATHER THEN LUCK. PLEASE CONTACT ME IF NEEDED.  *TR",
