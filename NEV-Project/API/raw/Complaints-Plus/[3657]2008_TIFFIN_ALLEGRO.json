THIS WAS THE ISSUE OF THE RECALL.  WE MADE A QUICK STOP TO AVOID A VEHICLE AND THEN THE BRAKES BEGAN TO DRAG.  PULLED OVER, BRAKES WERE OVERHEATED SO WE BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR REPAIR FACILITY.  WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE SLOWLY TO THE GARAGE WHICH WAS ONLY ABOUT A HALF MILE.  SPENT SOMEWHERE AROUND 6 HOURS IN REPAIR FACILITY.  THEY REPLACED THE CALIPERS ON BOTH REAR BRAKES.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECALL STATED WOULD HAPPEN.  WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED, AND STILL DON;T KNOW IF OUR VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  THERE MAY BE OTHERS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE.",
