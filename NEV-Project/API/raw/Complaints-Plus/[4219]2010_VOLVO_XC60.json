WINDSHIELD FOR VOLVO XC60 IS KNOWN FOR A FAILURE OF BONDING ALONG THE TOP EDGE. WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN THE SERVICE GUYS WERE ABLE TO JUST PUSH THE WINDSHIELD UPWARDS AND OUT WITH THEIR BARE HANDS TO SHOW ME THAT THERE IS A HUGE GAP ALONG THE TOP EDGE. THIS HAPPENED TO MY CAR IN THE PAST 1 MONTH AND ENDED IN A $420 REPAIR THAT INVOLVED POPPING THE WHOLE THING OFF AND RESEALING IT. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE WATER DRIPS ONTO THE STEERING WHEEL AND ELECTRONICS, WHICH IS DISTRACTING FOR THE DRIVER, BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY A HUGE THREAT TO THE CAR'S ELECTRONIC SYSTEM.     2. IN THE SAME MONTH, THE CAR JUST FAILED COMPLETELY, FLASHING ALL SORTS OF DASHBOARD LIGHTS AND DEMANDING TO BE PUT INTO PARK WHEN IT WAS ALREADY IN PARK. IT SAID BRAKES AND SRS AIRBAGS WERE FAILING. THE WHOLE SYSTEM WENT BLACK AND THE FOB WAS STUCK IN THE CONSOLE. THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY SAID THE CULPRIT WAS THE RDAR SOFTWARE, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE SATELLITE RADIO. IT CAUSES A PARASITIC DRAW THAT KEEPS SEARCHES FOR A SIGNAL EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS OFF. THEY WILL CHARGE EVERYONE HUNDREDS TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE (NOT INCLUDED IN THE FREE SOFTWARE UPDATE VOLVO BOASTS ABOUT), AND SOMETIMES MORE TO REPLACE THE BATTERY, PLUS LABOR, OR MAYBE QUOTE THOUSANDS TO TRY TO DISABLE THE SATELLITE RADIO COMPLETELY, WHICH IS HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S INTEGRATED INTO THE REST OF THE ELECTRONICS. LUCKILY MINE WAS PARKED WHEN THIS HAPPENED, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS NEEDS EXPLANATION FOR WHY IT'S DANGEROUS IF THE CAR JUST RANDOMLY DRAINS OF BATTERY WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING DUE TO A FAULTY SATELLITE RADIO SYSTEM THAT VOLVO + DEALERSHIPS WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT AND CHARGE CUSTOMERS HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS VERY WELL DOCUMENTED.
