        "summary": "GREASE SEALS ON INNER HUB AND CAP ON OUTER HUB LEAKED GREASE INTO BRAKE SYSTEM AND CONTAMINATED THE BRAKES.  COULD BE THE GREASE WAS TOO THIN, OVER PACKED OR GREASE SEALS DEFECTIVE.  I HAVE CLEANED AND RESEALED MY BRAKES TWICE.  LIPPERT WHO SUPPLIES THE AXLE AND BRAKE ASSEMBLIES TO GRAND DESIGN SENT ME NEW GREASE SEALS ONCE BUT DID NOT AGREE TO PAY FOR MY TIME AND OTHER SUPPLIES.  I WAS ABLE TO CATCH IT QUICK ENOUGH THAT THE BRAKE SHOES HAD NOT BEEN CONTAMINATED YET. WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS THERE IS NO BRAKING ACTION ON THE TRAILER DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION THAT INCLUDES GREASE ON THE BRAKE MAGNETS WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW THE BRAKE TO WORK.  THIS CONTAMINATION OCCURRED SOMETIME WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP.  SINCE I HAVE REPLACED THE SEALS AND  USED A GOOD WHEEL BEARING GREASE I HAVE NOT HAD A RECURRENCE OF BRAKE FAILURE.  THIS CONDITION CAUSES BRAKING LOSS ON THE TRAILER BRAKES THAT RESULTS IN AN UNSAFE CONDITION THAT CAN LEAD TO PROPERTY DAMAGE AND INJURY OR DEATH.  GRAND DESIGN AND LIPPERT ARE BOTH AWARE OF THIS CONDITION BUT HAVE ONLY OFFERED TO PROVIDE PARTS TO CORRECT THE CONDITION BUT BASED ON OTHER OWNERS REPORTS OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS HAVE DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  DATE BELOW IS APPROXIMATE",
