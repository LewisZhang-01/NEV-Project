        "summary": "My car has been automatically shutting off while driving. Bringing my car to a halt, not a full on stop but to the point my wheels lock up. Sort of like im slamming on my brake but I can't press my brake. I lose power steering, the entire car shuts off. Then I have to try and restart it, but it won't turn over. Sometimes its just for a few minutes. Other times Im stranded for hours. A few times its been days. After it dies and i turn the key off and then back on but not over ill have power. I have a kid and we've been stranded on an on ramp with cars going 60 all around us. The car just randomly shut off in the middle of the road. There's a lot of traffic around these parts and we were stuck, not even being able to get out of the vehicle with the cars going on each side of us. Ive done some research and ive seen thousands of other complaints about this issue since 2002. Ive had 3 different mechanics try to figure out what the issue was. Have had my car at the shop for weeks at a time. A few times even the mechanics couldn't get it started, and it had to sit for 3 days before it would start up again. The check engine light is on and all 3 different mechanics have fixed everything thats came up. After this started happening ive had to replace brakes and rotors several times. My car started shifting way to late. And feels like its starting to slip. This is a safety hazzard. Especially in larger cities.",

I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE ONE TIRE IN JANUARY OF 2010.  I REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE TIRE UNDER ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE DUE TO A DEFECT IN THE SIDEWALL.      2.  ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011 I HAD A CATASTROPHIC TIRE FAILURE ON INTERSTATE 64 IN ST. LOUIS.  THE TIRE DIDN'T JUST BLOW OUT, IT HAD FULL TREAD SEPARATION.  THE HIGHWAY WAS CLEAR OF ALL SNOW AND SLUSH IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  MY ESTIMATED SPEED WAS 50 MPH AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.  THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS 9 DEGREES ABOVE ZERO.  I WAS NOT IN A TURN, AND DID NOT HIT ANY ROAD HAZARDS.  THE TIRES ON MY VEHICLE WERE INFLATED PROPERLY.  THE SHOP REPORTED THAT THE OTHER TIRES HAD VERY EVEN TIRE WEAR, SUGGESTING THAT THE WHEELS WERE ALIGNED PROPERLY, THE SUSPENSION WAS OPERATING PROPERLY, AND THE TIRES WERE INFLATED PROPERLY.    THE RESULTING DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE WAS SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE LEFT REAR ALLOY WHEEL, THE DEFECTIVE TIRE, AND THE NEED FOR A WHEEL ALIGNMENT DUE TO THE CAR RIDING ON THE ALLOY WHEEL.    I CONTACTED BRIDGESTONE, AND WAS GIVEN THE RUNAROUND.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT BRIDGESTONE DID NOT WANT TO HELP ME IN ANY WAY.  THE BRIDGESTONE LAWYER TOLD ME ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THAT THEY HAD ALREADY LOOKED AT THE TIRE.  I CONTACTED THE SHOP, AND BRIDGESTONE DID NOT LOOK AT THE TIRE.  I INFORMED THE LAWYER THAT THEY COULD FIND THE REST OF MY TIRE ON TOP OF A SNOW BANK ON I-64 BETWEEN KINGSHIGHWAY AND GRAND AVENUE.  THE TREAD WAS INTACT, AND IN ONE PIECE.  SHE DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN SEEING THE TREAD, SUGGESTING THAT BRIDGESTONE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE PROBLEMS ON THEIR OWN, AND NEED A GOVERNMENT WATCH DOG TO FORCE THEM TO LOOK INTO DEFECTS.    THE BLOWOUT THAT I EXPERIENCED WOULD HAVE LIKELY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT IF IT HAD HAPPENED ON A FRONT WHEEL.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE TIRES ASAP, AS THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. *TR",

IT DOWNSHIFTED ON THE FREEWAY ON THE OFFRAMP TO ACURA OXMOOR IN LOUISVILLE GOING 60 MPH, THEN THE ENGINE REVVED AND I COULDN'T STOP IT. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE. MY NOW EX-HUSBAND INSISTED WE LEASE THE CAR AND NOW I'M STUCK WITH IT IN THE DIVORCE, IT'S OVER MILAGE AND IN ORDER TO GET THE MILAGE FORGIVEN I HAVE TO BUY IT FROM THEM IN NOVEMBER AT AN INFLATED PRICE AND WITH BAD CREDIT FROM MY DIVORCE. THE TRADE IN VALUE HAS FALLEN $7000 SINCE FEBRUARY. OH YES, AT 86,000 MILES THE SECOND TRANNY HAS GONE BAD. THIS TIME IT DOWNSHIFTED AGAIN WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A SLICK STREET IN THE RAIN.  THESE TRANSMISSIONS FAIL WITH NO WARNING.  THIS IS THE THRID TRANSMISSION AND THE CAR HAS LOST ALL ITS VALUE BECAUSE IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM  I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.*AK",

ON A RECENT TRIP FROM LOS ANGELES TO LAS VEGAS I NOTICED AN UNUSUAL AMOUT OF VIBRATION WHEN BRAKING THE CAR FROM HIGH SPEEDS (70'S). I HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME EARLIER AND THE DEALER TURNED AND RESURFACED THE ROTORS AND REPLACED THE PADS WITH \"NON DESTRUCTIVE\" NEW ONES. THE EARLEIR EVENT HAPPENED AROUND 15,000 MILES OR SO. LAST WEEK MY TRANSMISSION FAILED (HONDA IS NOW RECALLING) AND I INFORMED THE SERVICE TECH OF MY RECURRING BRAKING PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD TODAY, BY KEYS ACURA VAN NUYS, CA THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO FIX THE BRAKES AND I SHOULD PAY TO HAVE THE NOW WARPED ROTORS REPLACED WHEN THE PADS WEAR OUT! I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS! THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I'VE OWNED THAT HAD 2 MAJOR BRAKING FAILEURES IN LESS THAN 20000 MILES AND THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPAIR IT. I BELIEVE THIS IS OF GREAT SAFTEY CONCERN AND NOT AT ALL NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR! I DON'T LIVE IN SAN FRANSISCO WHERE THE HILLS CAN TEAR UP YOUR BRAKES. I KNOW OTHER ACURA OWNERS HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH THE BREAKS AND I PERSONALLY THINK THEY ARE ENDANGERING PEOPLE BY NEGLECTING TO SERVICE THIS DANGEROUS FAILURE.

I HAD TO CARRY IT TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THEY KEPT IT FOR A WEEK BEFORE THEY FINALLY FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS DEFECTIVE.

THIS TIME I LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AS THE TRANSMISSION ABRUPTLY DROPPED INTO A LOWER GEAR AND MY SPEED WENT FROM 75MPH TOO LESS THAN 10 MPH.

TODAY'S INCIDENT WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE ONLY REASON I MADE IT HOME SAFELY TONIGHT WAS PURE LUCK! ON CA-101 IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA DURING RUSH-HOUR I WAS IN BUMPER-TO-BUMPER TRAFFIC TRAVELING AT 65 MPH SURROUNDED BY CARS WHEN MY FRONT TIRE LOCKED UP SENDING MY CAR INTO THE LANE ON MY RIGHT. AS I COUNTER-STEERED TO KEEP THE CAR FROM CRASHING INTO THE CARS ON MY RIGHT THE CAR STARTED TO LOSE CONTROL AND SWERVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL STUCK IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE FIRST GEAR. AFTER COMPLETING A 360 DEGREE SPIN AND BARELY AVOIDING THE HUGE SUV COMING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL AND PULL OFF OF THE FREEWAY WHERE I TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO CALM MYSELF AND THANK GOD I WAS STILL ALIVE. THE CAR IS STUCK IN ONE GEAR RIGHT NOW AND WILL BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP IN THE MORNING WHERE I AM GOING EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT UNTIL THE TRANSMISSION IS REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE, NOT REPAIRED.

WHEN MY VEHICLE FAILED TO STOP AND HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, THE AIR BAGS EXPLODED BUT THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT BELT WENT SLACK AND DIDN'T RESTRAIN ME.  UPON EXITING THE CAR, THEIR WAS A POOL OF BELT ABOUT 5 FEET IN LENGTH THAT HAD COME OUT OF THE SEAT BELT HOLDER UPON IMPACT.  ONCE I SAW THAT, I QUESTIONED THE DULUTH POLICE OFFICER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SEAT BELT HANGING OUT MY DOOR.  HE ASKED ME TO PULL BACK THE SHIRT I WAS WEARING TO CHECK MY NECK FOR MARKS THAT THE SEAT BELT WOULD HAVE LEFT HAD IT HELD ME IN PLACE.  I HAD NO MARKS ON MY NECK TO INDICATE THAT THE SEAT BELT IN ANYWAY RESTRAINED ME.  UPON IMPACT I WENT FORWARD AND INTO THE AIR BAG.  MY CAR WAS TOWED TO TAYLOR'S COLLISION CENTER IN DULUTH, GEORGIA AND THE NEXT DAY I WAS ASKED BY THE OWNER IF I KNEW THAT MY SEAT BELTS HAD NOT ENGAGED DURING THE ACCIDENT.  I SAID I REALIZED IT AND HAD NOT MARKS FROM BEING RESTRAINED.  I HAVE CALLED ACURA/AMERICAN HONDA AT THEIR CLIENT SERVICES LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE A RESOLUTION FROM THEM.
