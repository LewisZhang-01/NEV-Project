I CONTACTED HIM AND AFTER INVESTIGATING, HE OFFERED TO PAY HALF THE COST (TOTAL COST ESTIMATED TO BE $3200).  I LET THE CAR SIT AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR 21 DAYS WHILE I FOUGHT WITH THESE PEOPLE.

THAT DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE WIPER TRANSMISSION WAS BAD, THOUGH THIS WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  I PURCHASED A NEW WIPER TRANSMISSION AND HAD IT INSTALLED BY MY LOCAL MECHANIC, WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE LINKAGES ARE MADE OF PLASTIC AND DRIVING IN INCLEMENT WEATHER, SUCH AS SNOW, MIGHT CAUSE FAILURE.  I FEEL THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION, WHEREBY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN INCLEMENT WEATHER, AND IF THE UNDERLYING COMPONENTS ARE OF INFERIOR QUALITY, IT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY NON-PROBLEMATIC MATERIALS.      THE SERVICING DEALER CLAIMS THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO MY NOT CLEANING THE AREA SURROUNDING THE WIPER ARMS.  BUT THIS IS NOT CORRECT, AS I DID CLEAN THIS AREA.  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE THIS VEHICLE DURING A STORM WITHOUT HAVING TO PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY TO MANUALLY CLEAN THE WIPERS AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  IF THE LINKAGES ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE SNOW AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THEN THEY MUST BE UPGRADED. *JB",

WITH LESS THAN 2000 MILES ON VEHICLE SAME TIRE (RIGHT REAR) STARTED LOSING AIR PRESSURE.  1ST TIME TOOK TO DEALER THEY SAID NOTHING WRONG.  2ND TIME FRADULENTLLY CHARGED ME $17.07 TO REPPAIR.  WARRANTY BOOK, PART #05CHEVWAR A FIRST EDITION SAYS   BUMPER-TO-BUMPER (INCLUDES TIRES) FOR 3YERS OR 36,000 MILES. VEHICLE ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD AND LESS THAN 4,000 MILES.  AFTER PAYING FOR REPAIRS STILL HAVE SAME PROBLEM.  SAME TIRE (RIGHT REAR) STILL LOSES AIR.  (2)  LUCKILY NO FAILURE YET DUE TO WARNING LIGHT ON VEHICLE THAT ALERTS YOU TO CHECK TIRE PRESSURE BEFORE TIRE BLOWS OUT DUE TO UNDERINFLATION.  (3).  AFTER 2 TRIPS TO DEALER NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT FAILURE.*AK",

        "summary": "WE OWN A 2005 CHEVY TRAIL BLAZER.  OUR 11-YEAR OLD SON FELL ASLEEP AND LAY DOWN WITH SHOULDER-HARNESSED SEAT BELT ON IN THE BACK SEAT - PASSENGER SIDE.  UPON ARRIVING AT OUR DESTINATION HE WAS AWAKENED.  AT THIS POINT HE SAT UP, RELEASED THE LATCH, AN TRIED TO GET OUT.  THE SEAT BELT WAS TWISTED AROUND HIS WAIST AND AS HE TRIED TO UNTANGLE THE BELT THE RATCHET GOT SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTER.  WHEN I REALIZED THE PROBLEM DEVELOPING AND GOT AROUND TO HIM THE BELT WAS SO TIGHT THAT I COULD NOT UNTANGLE HIM OR SLIP HIM THROUGH THE LOOP.  HE WAS IN SEVERE PAIN.  HE HAD EITHER TURNED IN HIS SEAT, OR SAT UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE SHOULDER STRAP, OR SOMETHING ELSE.  NOT WANTING ANY INJURY TO MY SON'S BACK OR ANY INTERNAL ORGANS I HAD TO CUT THE BELT.  IT WAS ABOUT 12:30 AM.  I HAVE SINCE BEEN TOLD THAT FOR SHOULDER HARNESSED BELTS, WHEN THE SHOULDER STRAP IS PULLED ALL THE WAY OUT AS FOR USE WITH CHILD SAFETY SEATS THIS ENGAGES THE RATCHETING MECHANISM.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A \"RELEASE BUTTON\" FOR EMERGENCY USE ON THE BACK OF THE COLUMN WHICH HOUSES THE SHOULDER STRAP.  SINCE THE BRAKES WERE NOT ENGAGED I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE SHOULDER STRAP WOULD NOT LOOSEN.*AK",
