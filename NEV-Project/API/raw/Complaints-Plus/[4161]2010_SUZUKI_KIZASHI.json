The contact stated that she was not aware of warning lights only a short beeping sound when any weight was placed on the seat. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed and the seat cushion sensor was replaced. The contact later received another recall letter stating that the seat cushion sensor had to be replaced with a newer sensor. The vehicle was not repaired because the dealer did not have the part. The dealer informed the contact that the manufacturer had not responded to a request for a parts update. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure but could not provide a timeline on parts availability. The failure mileage was approximately 52,000.",

        "summary": "IN THE PAST 13 MONTHS I HAVE HAD TO HAVE A ENGINE REPLACEMENT IN WHICH THE VEHICLE WAS POURING CARBON MONOXIDE INTO THE CAR, I WENT TO PICK THE VEHICLE UP AFTER BEING REPAIRED FOR OVER A MONTH AT THE SUZUKI DEALERSHIP IN CHARLOTTE, NC. I DROVE THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES AWAY WHERE THE VEHICLE CUT OFF AS I WAS MAKING A TURN INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION LEAVING ME STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. AFTER SEVERAL MORE WEEKS OF BEING AT THE DEALERSHIP I LEFT WITH A NEW TRANSMISSION ALONG WITH THE NEW MOTOR. 6 WEEKS LATER THE TRANSMISSION BROKE DOWN AGAIN WHEN I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE WITH MY DAUGHTER IN THE CAR. THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT A SUZUKI DEALERSHIP IN HICKORY, NC. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR 6 MORE WEEKS WHEN THE VEHICLE BROKE DOWN FOR A THIRD TIME WHILE I WAS DRIVING THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION. NONE OF THESE BREAK DOWNS HAVE RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT BUT I FEAR THE TROUBLE WITH THIS CAR IS ENDANGERING MY LIFE AND MY CHILD'S LIFE. I HAVE HAD A SUZUKI ENGINE EXPERT FROM THE HICKORY SERVICE CENTER LOOK AT MY CAR AND HE CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHY THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO BREAKDOWN THE LAST TIME THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED IN JANUARY OF 2014 I HAD TO REPLACE THE FRONT TIRES I WAS TOLD AN ALIGNMENT WAS NEEDED BECAUSE THE CAR WAS DESTROYING IN THE INNER SIDE OF MY FRONT TIRES. I HAVE HAD TWO ALIGNMENTS AND A WHOLE NEW SET OF TIRES ON THE FRONT OF MY CAR AND AGAIN I AM NEEDING TO REPLACE THEM AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHY THIS IS HAPPENING JUST THAT THIS CAR IS PROBLEMATIC. I FEAR THAT I HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER RESOURCES I WAS SOLD A LEMON AND IF I HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW SUZUKI WOULD OF BEEN OBLIGATED TO REPLACE THIS VEHICLE UNDER LEMON LAW BUT BECAUSE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE USED. I PURCHASED SOMETHING THAT I FEEL COULD ENDANGER MY CHILD OR MYSELF.   *TR",
