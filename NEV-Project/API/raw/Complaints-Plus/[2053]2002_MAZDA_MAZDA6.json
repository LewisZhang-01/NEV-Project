SECOND FLAT 2 MONTHS AGO, AND THRID THIS WEEK, BEING TOLD THE SAME THING.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ALIGNMENT.  I DO NOT NEED AN ALIGNMENT.  . HAVE NOT CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP YET- AND REALLY DO NOT WANT TO AFTER THE MESS THEY PUT ME THROUGH WITH PURCHASING THE CAR. I DO NOT WANT MY TIRES REPLACED, BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW IF MY FRAME IS BUILT INCORRECTLY, OR ANY OTHER REASON THIS MAY HAPPEN.  I ALSO HAVE THE SQUEAK NOISE WHEN TURNING MY STEERING WHEEL.*AK",
