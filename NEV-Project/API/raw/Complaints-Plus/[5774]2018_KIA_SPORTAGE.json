My car was broken into and the youth stripped the steering column and was able to start my car without needing the key nor having the key within the vehicle.  This is a security issue and allows the vehicles to be easily stolen.  These safety issues should be address and fixed immediately by Kia.  The federal government should also hold Kia responsible for the spike in stolen vehicles across the U.S. seeing they know about the issue but have done nothing to fix it.  The vehicle was then crashed and left running by the youth.  I have included the estimate from Progressive to get it fixed.",

At times, it has presented a safety risk especially when attempting to merge on a highway in a short merge lane.  When the slipping occurs in this situation, the car no longer accelerates and merging into traffic becomes very problematic and increases the risk of a rear end collision, putting me and my passengers at risk as well as a risk to others  The problem has not been reproduced or confirmed by the dealer.  It started occurring immediately after I purchased the car used while still under the manufacturers warranty.  Because the dealer service department could not replicate the issue, no further attempt to diagnose the issue has been conducted, such as a transmission tear down. I\u2019ve taken it to the dealer at least 3 times for this issue and have documentation.    I elevated the issue to the manufacturer but they have offered no solution to the issue because it cannot be replicated by the dealer and there is no recall or other service issue with the model.  Melissa from the KIA Escalation Department contacted me today offered no resolution to the matter.    There were no warning lamps or other messages which indicated a problem.  The Kia Forum website reveals that I am not the only one with this issue.    https://www.kia-forums.com/threads/transmission-slipping.288137/page-5",

Got someone to jump  My vehicle, we let it charge from the jumper and got the vehicle started again.  Drove 4 miles down the road, same thing again. Had my wife come there and we again put jumper cables on for 20 minutes, was able to drive the vehicle home, did notice this time I had a check engine light.  Have scheduled an appointment with my dealer again. I feel that on a dark country road with limited areas to pull over with no headlights or tail lights or 4 way flashers I could have easily been rear ended. I did have cars pass me and blow their horn at me, did finally make it to a cross road with a street light and got off the main road.

THE TURN SIGNALS ARE NOT VISIBLE TO CARS BEHIND. HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 6 WEEKS AND HAVE HAD A FEW VERY CLOSE INCIDENTS ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAY IN TRAFFIC. CARS DO NOT SLOW DOWN WHEN I INDICATE AND I HAVE HAD TWO INCIDENTS WHERE MOTORISTS HAVE TOLD ME I HAD FAILED TO SIGNAL AND MANY INSTANCES OF MOTORISTS HONKING. VERY DANGEROUS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND MERGING. REVERSE LIGHTS CANNOT BE SEEN. VERY THIN, NOT INTEGRATED WITH OTHER BACK LIGHTS AND PLACED TOO LOW DOWN. THEY LOOK LIKE REFLECTORS AND ON A WHITE CAR CANNOT BE SEEN. I PURCHASED TWO SPORTAGES. MY DAUGHTER DRIVES ONE AND HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS. I OWNED A SORENTO AND FORTE WHICH I TRADED IN TO GET AWD VEHICLES WHICH I THOUGHT WERE SAFER FOR COLORADO DRIVING. SPORTAGE IS THE ONLY CAR WITH THIS ISSUE. KIA WON'T INTEGRATE THE TURN SIGNAL WITH THE BRAKES. MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.",
