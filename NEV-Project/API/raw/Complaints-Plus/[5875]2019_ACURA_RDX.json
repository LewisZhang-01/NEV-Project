While traveling on the PA turnpike, the car suddenly and with no warning went into \"limp mode\", with only enough power available to maintain about 20 mph. The \"check engine\" light came on, and we continued at about 20 mph on the shoulder, hoping to come to an exit. After a few minutes and no exit in sight, we stopped and turned off the engine while considering what to do next. When the air inside of the car became uncomfortably warm, I turned on the engine so we would have a/c. Immediately, it became apparent that the engine was working normally: no \"check engine\" light, plus other positive indications. We resumed our trip, arriving home safely.  Our safety was at risk since the engine lost power with no warning whatsoever, and occurred while we were in a travel lane. As of this report, the car has not been taken to a dealer.",

These cracks hinder the structure of the windshield, can obscure view, or refract light; limiting driver visibility and affecting the safety system.  Seemingly minor strikes from road debris  cause stellate chips and cracks 3-4 inches long that cannot be repaired; requiring complete replacement of the windshield and realigning of camera/radar safety systems.

THIS IS AN APPLE ISSUE, NOT AN ACURA ISSUE.    THIRD PARTY APPS FOR APPLE CARPLAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FROM THIS DATE BUT VOICE RECOGNITION WILL NOT WORK WITH THEM, AT LEAST IN THE 2019 ACURA RDX (LISTED AS COMPATIBLE) AND MOST LIKELY ALL VEHICLES THAT DO NOT HAVE TOUCHSCREENS. I HAVE DONE EXHAUSTIVE TESTING ON THIS ISSUE AND REPORTED IT TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF APPLE THAT APPLECARE WILL ALLOW ME TO GO BUT I GET 'STONEWALLED' ABOUT THIS WITH APPLE CLAIMING IT IS A PROBLEM WITH GOOGLE MAPS AND WAZE, NOT CARPLAY. HOWEVER BOTH APPS USE THE THE SAME GUI WHICH SENDS ME A MESSAGE THAT IT IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CARPLAY SOFTWARE LIBRARY, NOT THE 3RD PARTY APPS. HOWEVER APPLE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS OR GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO RESOLVING IT.    I AM OF THE OPINION IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AS IT CAN LEAD TO DRIVER DISTRACTION RESULTING IN ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLE INJURY OR DEATH. I HAVE SUGGESTED TO APPLE, AND GOOGLE THAT THE APPS BE DISABLED IN CARPLAY UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED BUT HAVE FAILED TO RECEIVE ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THIS SUGGESTION. EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION OF APPLE'S REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR MANY WEEKS NOW. WITH THE LATEST ATTEMPT ON THE DATE BELOW. GOOGLE, CREATOR OF THE CURRENT 3RD PARTY APPS HAS ALSO BEEN INFORMED WITH NO RESPONSE.",
