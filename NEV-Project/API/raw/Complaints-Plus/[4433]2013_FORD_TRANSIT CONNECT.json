I WAS ABLE TO FINALLY REVERSE TO A DRIVEWAY AND AFTER 30 MINUTES GET THE VEHICLE TO MOVE DOWN THE SMALL GRADE. I LITERALLY WAS ABLE TO DRIVE A 14 YEAR OLD HONDA CIVIC THAT COST $3200 UP THE SLIGHT SLOPE THAT A LIKE NEW WITH ONLY 32K MILES ON IT TRANSIT CONNECT WOULD NOT GO. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE. SO FAR THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND FORDS CUSTOMER CARE LINE HAVE NO ANSWERS FOR ME. WHY IN THE OWNERS MANUAL IS THERE A LISTED TCS SHUT OFF BUTTON AND A LOCATION ON MY DASHBOARD FOR IT BUT NO PART # OR OPTION TO ADD IT TO MY VEHICLE. I INVESTED IN THIS FORD FOR MY BUSINESS AND NOW I CANNOT EVEN GET TO CUSTOMERS HOMES. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT NOW AND NOT SURE WHAT TO DO SINCE THE DEALER HAS NO ANSWERS AND FORD HAD NONE EITHER. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENGINEERS AT FORD MOTOR COMPANY DID NOT THINK TO OUT THIS TCS OFF BUTTON ON ALL VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH TCS AND THAT THE NHTSA HAS NOT FINED FORD MOTOR COMPANY THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL. , HOW CAN ENGINEERS DESIGNE A VEHICLE FOR THE USA THAT WILL NOT MOVE IN AN INCH OF SNOW?",
