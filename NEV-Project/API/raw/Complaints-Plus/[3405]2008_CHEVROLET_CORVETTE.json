I HAVE BEEN DRAG RACING FOR THE BETTER PART OF 40 YEARS. I AM SAYING THIS TO ALLEVIATE ANY POSSIBLE THOUGHTS OF ROOKIE MOVES ON MY PART ON THE TRACK, ETC. THE LOCAL TRACK IS AN NHRA SANCTIONED TRACK THAT TAKES SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEIR TRACK PREP IS SECOND TO NONE, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PARTICULAR EVENT, THAT IS ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS OF RACERS FROM MANY STATES.  I STAGED MY CAR IN THE RIGHT LANE OF THE TRACK WITH \"COMPETITION MODE\" ENGAGED, AS I HAVE EVERY TIME IN THE PAST. THE CAR LAUNCHED STRAIGHT AND TRUE AS IT NORMALLY DOES. THE RUN WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL AND STRAIGHT UNTIL AFTER CROSSING THE QUARTER MILE FINISH LINE, WHEN I LET OFF THE GAS, THE CAR MADE AN IMMEDIATE HOOK TO THE RIGHT, DIRECTLY INTO THE CONCRETE RETAINING WALL. I BOUNCED OFF THAT WALL, CROSSING THE PATH OF MY OPPONENT IN THE LEFT LANE, IN A NEAR COLLISION, BOUNCING OFF THE LEFT WALL, AND THEN BACK OVER AGAIN INTO THE RIGHT WALL. I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE CAR ON MY OWN.  I WAS COMPLETELY STUNNED, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED ANY OF THIS. NOTHING MADE SENSE. BY THE TIME YOU CROSS THE FINISH LINE, UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE TRACK, LOSS OF TRACTION IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. IN MY OWN INVESTIGATION I RAN ACROSS MULIPLE EVENTS OF THIS PARTICULAR MAKE AND MODEL THAT HAS HAD ACTIVE HANDLING ISSUES THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS TYPE OF ACTION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN A HEAVY BRAKING OF THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL.

I ONLY FILLED IT UNTIL THE PUMP CLICKED OFF.I WAS ALREADY AWARE OVERFILLING IS NOT GOOD FOR THE CAR NOR IS IT A SAFE PRACTICE. I DROVE ABOUT 25-30 MILES BEFORE RETURNING HOME. EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN I WENT OUT TO MY GARAGE. THE SMELL OF GAS WAS OVERPOWERING. I IMMEDIATELY OPENED BOTH DOORS IN THE GARAGE TO ALLOW IT TO AIR OUT. I THEN CHECKED THE GAS CAP. I CHECKED FOR ANY LEAKS BUT COULDN'T FIND ANY. I CALLED MY MECHANIC AND RELUCTANTLY DROVE 2 BLOCKS TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. HE SPENT ABOUT 2 HOURS LOOKING THE CAR OVER BUT COULDN'T FIND ANY LEAKS. HE THEN CALLED HIS CONTACTS AT THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER. HE WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE CAR. HE ASKED IF CHEVROLET HAD ISSUED ANY SAFETY RECALLS AND WE WERE BOTH VERY SHOCKED THAT ALTHOUGH CHEVROLET IS VERY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THEY DON'T THINK THERE CUSTOMERS SAFETY IS WORTH TAKING AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM LINE. THIS REPAIR IS GOING TO COST $2700. THAT'S BAD ENOUGH BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I HAD BEEN REAR ENDED OR T- BONED AFTER FILLING UP ? I'M THINKING THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION RESULTING IN SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH. TO THINK THAT CHEVROLET IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM IS  INFURIATING. I COULDN'T SMELL THE FUEL WHEN I WAS DRIVING, ONLY AFTER I HAD PARKED IN THE GARAGE. I ALSO COULD ONLY DETECT A VERY SLIGHT ODOR WHEN IT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE AT THE MECHANICS SHOP THE FOLLOWING DAY. AFTER THE MECHANIC DROPPED THE TANK AND SHIELD YOU COULD CLEARLY SEE FLUID MARKS WERE THE GAS WAS LEAKING. AT THE VERY LEAST CHEVROLET COULD INFORM THEIR CUSTOMERS. PERHAPS LIKE ME THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO REPAIR IT,ASSUMING THEY COULD AFFORD IT, RATHER THAN BEING TRAPPED IN A BURNING CAR.

IN 2016 I DIDN'T HAVE THAT ISSUE AND FILED THE LETTER. NOW IN 2017 I HAVE THAT PROBLEM BUT THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR WAS ONLY COVERED UNTIL LAST AUG. THIS REPAIR IS APPROXIMATELY $5000.00.  HOW CAN GENERAL MOTORS EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM A POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE CONDITION FROM A FAULTY GAS VALVE.  THEY WERE AWARE THERE VALVES WERE FAILING AND HOPING THEY COULD GET THE EFFECTED AUTOMOBILES BEYOND THE 10 YEAR LIMIT.  IF THEY TRULY HAD THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY IN MIND THE WOULD HAVE INSTRUCTED ALL OWNER OF THE CORVETTES WITH THIS FAULTY GAS VALVE TO HAVE THEIR CAR REPAIRED IN JUNE OF 2016, BEFORE THE \"SMELL\" OCCURRED.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH A DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I CANNOT PARK MY CAR IN MY GARAGE WITH OUT LEAVING A DOOR OPEN FOR FEAR OF A FIRE OR WORSE.  THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY ANY THING AN OWNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  NOT LACK OF PROPER MAINTENANCE, OR VEHICLE ABUSE. I'VE TRIED CALLING GENERAL MOTORS BUT ONLY GET SOME COMPUTER THAT SCREENS CALLS.

HOWEVER BECAUSE THE SMELL WAS SO STRONG, I TOOK THE CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE AND PARKED IT IN THE DRIVEWAY.  THE NEXT DAY I CHECKED AND THERE WAS STILL STRONG GAS SMELL AROUND THE VEHICLE.  AT THAT POINT I DECIDED TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM EVALUATE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER LEAVING THE CAR WITH THEM, THEY CONTACTED ME THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THAT THE SMELL OF GAS WAS COMING FROM A CRACK  IN THE FUEL TANK.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE FUEL TANK IS LOCATED IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE ABOVE THE EXHAUST PIPES.  I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AND ANY OTHER ITEM IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE THAT NEEDED REPAIR.  THE FUEL TANK WAS REPLACE AT A COST OF $3056.97.  I ALSO HAD THEM TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP SINCE THEY HAD THE TANK REMOVED AND HAD ACCESS TO THE FUEL PUMP.  FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO USE MY 10% MILITARY DISCOUNT OR THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER.  AFTER THE CAR WAS REPAIRED, I RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET AND SAW WHERE OTHER 2008 CORVETTE OWNERS HAD THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CAR.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE IS A DEFECT IN THESE FUEL TANKS AND CHEVROLET SHOULD OFFICIALLY DO A RECALL ON THE 2008 CORVETTES AND ANY OTHER YEAR MODEL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP CRACKS IN THE FUEL TANKS.  IF THERE IS NO RECALL, SOMEONE COULD SERIOUSLY BE INJURED BY THE FUEL TANK PROBLEM.  I HOPE BY DOCUMENTING THIS PROBLEM IT WILL BRING SOME TYPE OF POSITIVE RESOLUTION FROM CHEVROLET/GM.  *TR",

AFTER THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEMS THEY TOLD ME THE FUEL PUMP ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WAS CRACKED AND LEAKING FUEL DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TANK.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FUEL SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SIDE GAS TANK WAS DEFECTIVE CAUSING A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND CAUSING THE FUEL GAUGE TO READ ZERO GAS IN THE TANK INTERMITTENTLY (TANK IS ACTUALLY HALF FULL).  THE DEALER ALSO SAID THE CROSSOVER TUBE THAT CONNECTS THE LEFT AND RIGHT GAS TANKS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALER SAID THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AND TO NOT DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THE FUEL SYSTEM IS REPAIRED BECAUSE THE HOT EXHAUST PIPE ROUTES RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THE GAS IS LEAKING DOWN THE GAS TANK.  THEIR REPAIR ESTIMATE IS $3187. MY CAR HAS 80K MILES ON IT AND IS OUT OF STANDARD WARRANTY SO GM WON'T COVER THE REPAIR COSTS.

THE LEAK DRIPS VERY CLOSE TO THE EXHAUST PIPE AND WOULD APPEAR TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AN INVESTIGATION AND OR RECALL OF THESE CARS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET.",

I DROPPED THE CORVETTE OFF AT CHEVROLET OF GADSDEN AND DISCUSSED THE INCIDENT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER. HE SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR A REPLY FROM GM.  I WAS INFORMED THE NEXT DAY THAT GM WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE REPAIR OR ADMIT THERE WAS A SAFETY CONCERN  I WAS TOLD THE CLUTCH MASTER CYLINDER AND LABOR WERE $900.

IN THE MORNING THERE IS A STRONG SMELL OF FUEL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR.   THIS WOULD NOT NORMALLY BE AN ISSUE ON MOST CARS, BUT BECAUSE THE FUEL TANKS ARE SO HARD TO REMOVE AND EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR THE FUEL PUMP IS A $2,000 OR MORE REPAIR BECAUSE TRANSMISSION MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE CAR TO GET TO THE FUEL PUMP.  ON A RELATED NOTE GM HAS A REALLY BAD PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL LEVEL SENSORS GOING BAD AT LOW MILEAGE. THIS SENDS AN ERROR CODE AND A OWNER CANNOT PASS A BI ANNUAL SMOG CHECK UNTIL THEY PAY THE LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO GET THE FUEL LEVEL SENSORS REPLACED, ONCE AGAIN HAVING TO DROP THE TRANSMISSION TO DROP THE FUEL TANK TO REPLACE A FIFTY DOLLAR PART COST AROUND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE EPA OR FEDERAL AND STATE SMOG LAWS AND THE ERROR CODE, MAKE THE OWNER DO THE REPAIR, TO THE FUEL LEVEL SENSOR ALTHOUGH IT REALLY DOES NOT AFFECT THE EMISSIONS OF THE ENGINE, WHILE IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH GAS SPILLING OUT WHILE DRIVING.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE ON TOP OF THE OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT GM DOES NOT WANT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR...  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED FOR ALL CORVETTE WITH THE LOW MILEAGE LEAKING FUEL PUMP AND THE OWNERS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONES AT FAULT...  *TR",

HAVING A DEAD BATTERY, I PLACED THE CAR IN MY DRIVEWAY TO JUMP START IT. AS I WENT TO MY TRUCK TO START IT AND CONNECT THE JUMPER CABLES THE CORVETTE BEGAN TO SLOWLY ROLL BACKWARDS - APPARENTLY THE HAND BRAKE WAS NOT QUITE SET ENOUGH (MANUAL TRANSMISSION).  I WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO APPLY THE BRAKES OR HANDBRAKE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF BATTERY POWER.  THE CAR CONTINUED TO ROLL BACKWARDS, ACCELERATING, WITH ME UNABLE TO HOLD OR STOP IT.  IT ROLLED ACROSS THE STREET, DOWN MY NEIGHBOR'S DRIVEWAY, AND THROUGH HIS CLOSED GARAGE DOOR COMING TO A STOP AT THE REAR OF HIS GARAGE WITH A HEAVY IMPACT (OVER $11 THOUSAND IN DAMAGES). MY NEIGHBOR'S 2 SMALL GIRLS OFTEN PLAY IN THAT GARAGE WITH THE DOORS CLOSED OR IN THE DRIVEWAY.  IF THEY HAD BEEN PLAYING OR ANYONE OR ANY VEHICLE HAD BEEN IN THE STREET AT THAT TIME THERE WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN ONE OR MORE FATALITIES DUE TO THE RUNAWAY DRIVER-LESS VEHICLE. ONLY LUCK PREVENTED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH POSSIBLE FATALITIES OR SERIOUS INJURIES. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN UNACCEPTABLE AND UNNECESSARY DESIGN DEFECT FOR C6 CORVETTES (AND POSSIBLY OTHER VEHICLES WITH KEY-LESS ENTRY AND ELECTRICALLY OPERATED DOORS).  I BELIEVE THAT CHEVROLET SHOULD RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND ADD A MECHANICAL WAY TO QUICKLY OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE IN EVENT OF A RUNAWAY SITUATION (THERE IS A MECHANICAL BACKUP IF ONE IS IN THE CAR OR IF ONE HAS THE TIME TO MANUALLY OPEN THE TRUNK - A SLOW PROCEDURE).  *TR",

THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE SOLUTION IS TO DROP THE TANKS BECAUSE THE ISSUE MAY LIE IN THE FUEL PUMP AND LEAKING TANKS ON THE TOP. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE REGARDING LEAKING FUEL TANKS AND THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A FAULTY ITEM BEING A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I KNOW THIS WAS AN ISSUE ON THE C5 CORVETTE AND GM REPLACED THOSE TANKS FREE OF CHARGE. THE C6 FUEL CELL IS THE SAME AS THE C5 AND IT APPEARS LIKE ITS ALSO FAULTY AS WELL. PLEASE REVIEW ALL C6 CORVETTES (2005-2013) COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL OR A FIX BY GM TO COVER THE COSTS.  *TR",

NOW THAT SUMMER IS APPROACHING, I GET A BAD FUEL SMELL AFTER THE CAR HAD SAT FOR A FEW HOURS. IT PERMEATES THE PASSENGER CABIN. I TOOK THE CAR TO DEALER WITH 44K MILES, TECH FOUND THE DRIVER SIDE FUEL TANK HAS LEAK IN  PLASTIC SEAM WHERE THE FILLER NECK IS ATTACHED TO THE MAIN BODY OF THE TANK. THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS (2005 THRU 2012).  SEARCH ONLINE FOR \"C6 CORVETTE FUEL SMELL\", YOU WILL SEE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES REPORTING FUEL SMELL WHENEVER THE TANK IS MORE THAN HALF FULL ON THE GAUGE.  GM STATED THE FUEL TANK IS NOT COVERED UNLESS THE VEHICLE WAS EQUIPPED WITH CAL EMISSIONS (7YR/70K MILES) OTHER WISE ONLY 2YR/24K MILES. THE TANK IS THE SAME TANK USED ON ALL MODELS. GM IS SELECTIVELY COVERING SOME REPLACEMENTS AND REFUSING OTHERS.  WITH A LOW MILEAGE VEHICLE, I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO NEED TO REPLACE A FUEL TANK. I BOUGHT THE CAR WITH ROUGHLY 25000 MILES ON IT LAST JUNE. I BELIEVE THE TANK HAS BEEN LEAKING EVER SINCE AND MAYBE BEFORE I OWNED IT. SINCE GM WILL NOT COVER IT, I'M NOW LEFT WITH A $3000 REPAIR ESTIMATE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE TANK.  I HAVE A 2007 GM 4WD PICKUP WITH 117,000 MILES OF ROUGH ROADS, OFF ROAD, ETC AND NOT A DROP OF FUEL LEAKING FROM IT. HOW DOES A VEHICLE ONLY DESIGNED TO DRIVE ON THE STREET, THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLES GM MAKES, NOT HAVE BETTER FUEL TANKS. THIS IS A FIRE/EXPLOSION RISK AS THE FUEL RUNS DOWN THE BACK OF THE TANK, THEN DRIPS ONTO THE HOT EXHAUST RUNNING RIGHT BEHIND THE TANKS. THIS SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO THE C5 CORVETTE FUEL TANK PROBLEMS (ALMOST SAME BODY STYLE). I DON'T KNOW WHY GM HASN'T DESIGNED A FIX FOR THIS AND RECALLED ALL THE TANKS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC OTHER THAN PROFIT REASONS. I WILL PAY TO CHANGE THE OLD TANK OUT THIS WEEKEND TO MAKE  IT SAFE TO DRIVE AGAIN AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  *TR",

TWO CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RESOLVE THIS MALFUNCTION TO DATE (5/2/13).  SINCE 10/30/12, THIS CAR HAS BEEN SEEN SIX TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AT TWO DIFFERENT CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS.  THERE WAS A RECALL IN 2005 FOR THIS PROBLEM: \"STEERING RECALL 2005-2006\"  \"... IN RARE CASES, REPEATED MOVEMENT OF THE STEERING COLUMN MAY CAUSE A SIGNAL INTERRUPTION WITHIN THE COLUMN.  IF THIS OCCURS, THE MESSAGE, \"SERVICE ACTIVE HANDLING SYSTEM\" WILL APPEAR... AND ONE OR MORE OF THE BRAKES MAY APPLY...\".    THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DISPLAY MESSAGES ON MY CAR READING, \"PRESS BRAKE TO START ENGINE\", SO THIS PROBLEM, IN MY MIND, IS RELATED TO THE \"ACTIVE HANDLING SYSTEM\" ISSUE.  *TR",
