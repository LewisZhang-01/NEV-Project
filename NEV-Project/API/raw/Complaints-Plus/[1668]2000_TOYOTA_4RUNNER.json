I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT 1996-2002 TOYOTA 4RUNNER'S AND THEIR VERY COMMON ISSUE OF THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINTS FAILING. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE VEHICLE IS STOCK OR MODIFIED, FIRST YEAR OR LAST YEAR RUN BUT SOMEHOW TOYOTA ONLY HAS ISSUED A RECALL FOR THE 2001 AND 2002 MODEL YEARS. LEAVING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF US VULNERABLE TO A SEVERE ACCIDENT. THE FAILURE POINT IS THE BAIL JOINT AND WHEN IT FAILS IT SEVERS ITSELF FROM THE VEHICLE, PULLING THE AXLE SHAFT OUT AND CAUSING THE FRONT END TO DIP TO THE GROUND CAUSING A VERY UNSAFE DRIVING EXPERIENCE AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY DIE AT ANY SPEED. YOU CAN FIND THOUSANDS OF STORIES ON GOOGLE, IT HAPPENS LITERALLY EVERYDAY WITH PEOPLE REPORTING IN MANY 3RD GEN 4RUNNER FORUMS  AND FACEBOOK GROUPS. GOOGLE '3RD GEN 4RUNNER LBJ FAILURE' FOR INSTANCE.    WHY DOES TOYOTA ONLY NEED TO RECALL 2 YEARS OF A 6 YEAR VEHICLE RUN? ALL YEARS ARE EQUALLY AFFECTED. TOYOTA IS A NAME OF DEPENDABILITY SO THIS RARE ACT OF BETRAYING THE CUSTOMER AND PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IS JUST SO UNLIKE THEM. CAN YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND HELP YA OUT? I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY HAD THIS HAPPEN BUT I CHECK MY LOWER ARMS ALL THE TIME FOR ANY PLAY BUT HAVE HEARD STORIES OF OTHERS WITH DETAILED MAINTENANCE AND IT HAPPENING TO THEM REGARDLESS.

I HAD JUST BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE 1 MONTH AGO WITH 146,000 MILES ON IT AND IT IS CONSIDERED UNSAFE TO DRIVE. UNBELIEVABLE THAT THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THE 4RUNNER FOR THIS PROBLEM YET TOYOTA TRUCKS WITH THE SAME FRAME PROBLEM HAVE HAD RECALLS AND BUY BACK OFFERS. IS TOYOTA WAITING FOR DEATHS TO OCCUR? I HAVE PURCHASED 2 TOYOTA VEHICLES PRIOR TO THIS 4RUNNER. I TRUSTED THE NAME TO BE ONE OF THE SAFEST & MOST RELIABLE. I AM MORTIFIED TO KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WITH ROTTED FRAMES, QUITE POSSIBLY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN IN THEM, THAT COULD RESULT IN A DEATH IF THE FRAME GIVES OUT WHILE DRIVING. PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY NHTSA AND HELP TO GET THE TOYOTA 4RUNNER RECALLED FOR THIS ROTTED FRAME PROBLEM. IT IS TRULY A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH!! SHAME ON TOYOTA FOR MAKING LIGHT OF THE PROBLEM. MY TRUST IN THE TOYOTA NAME IS FOREVER TARNISHED. I, LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE POSTED ON HERE, WILL BE WAITING FOR A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO OCCUR. I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER SELL THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE KNOWING THEY COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR DIE DUE TO THE FRAME FAILING WHILE DRIVING.  *TR",

AFTER SPEAKING TO A MECHANIC, HE SAID THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2000 4RUNNERS AND TO CONTACT TOYOTA.  THE BACK FRAME ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE HAS COMPLETELY RUSTED THRU LEAVING THE REAR AXEL WITH NO SUPPORT.  AFTER READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME EXACT ISSUE, AT THE SAME EXACT LOCATION, MEANS THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A TOYOTA DEFECT.  I BOUGHT MY 4RUNNER UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS VEHICLE WOULD GET ME AT LEAST 200,000 MILES.  I'M CURRENTLY AT 118,000 AND IT ALREADY NEEDS TO GO TO THE JUNK YARD.  I'M SHOCKED AND APPALLED THAT TOYOTA WOULD ALLOW THESE VEHICLES TO BE OUT ON THE STREETS KNOWING THAT THEY ARE ENDANGERING HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF LIVES EVERYDAY.  THIS CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SUBJECT OF RECALL AND NO DOUBT LIVES WILL BE LOST BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE.  A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND TOYOTA NEEDS TO RECALL THIS VEHICLE ASAP.  AS IT STANDS I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA AND WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO TELL MY STORY AND HOW TOYOTA TURNS THEIR BACK ON CUSTOMERS AND THE SAFETY OF THOSE YOU DRIVE THIS 2000 4RUNNER.  WITH THE WEB AND ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA FORUMS AT MY FINGER TIPS, I WILL MAKE IT MY MISSION IN LIFE TO SEE THAT TOYOTA IS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR IRRESPONSIBILITY AND LACK OF LOYALTY TO TOYOTA BUYERS.  DO THE RIGHT TOYOTA AND RECALL THE 2000 4RUNNER FOR THE PIECE OF JUNK THAT IT IS BEFORE LIVES ARE LOST!

I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE.    THIS ISSUE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE TOYOTA TACOMA RECALL AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SIMILAR FASHION. I WAS TOLD BY CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THEM SIMILAR BECAUSE THE TACOMA FRAMES WERE MADE IN AMERICA WHILE THE 4RUNNER FRAMES WERE MADE IN JAPAN.  I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT TAKES AWAY THEIR LIABILITY FOR A POORLY MADE VEHICLE WITH CLEAR MANUFACTURING ISSUES. I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH OTHER 4RUNNER OWNERS AND KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST MY PROBLEM, THIS IS AN OWNER-WIDE ISSUE AND CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO TOYOTA'S MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF THIS VEHICLE.

I'VE TAKEN IT TO TWO DIFFERENT HIGHLY QUALIFIED BODY SHOPS AND BOTH HAVE GIVEN ME OUTRAGEOUS QUOTES TO GET THIS FRAME PATCHED, YET BOTH ALSO SAID IT WOULD ONLY BE A TEMPORARY FIX, THAT THE FRAME WOULD IN FACT NEED TO BE REPLACED, AND BOTH ENCOURAGED ME TO STOP DRIVING THE VEHICLE.

THERE IS NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT RUST ON THIS VEHICLE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE AXLE IS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION THEREFORE I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY TOYOTA.  I HAVE BEEN QUOTED $1500-$2000 FOR A REPLACEMENT AXLE WHICH IS 1/4 OF THE VEHICLE'S VALUE.  TOYOTA CHOSE A POOR DESIGN AND MATERIAL FOR THIS PART AND SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS ISSUE AS IT IS THE ONLY WEAK LINK ON THE ENTIRE VEHICLE, UNFORTUNATELY THE REAR AXLE IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PART FOR ITS OPERATION.  I HAVE REVIEWED SEVERAL MESSAGE BOARDS AND HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER 4RUNNER OWNERS IN THE RANGE FROM '99 TO '02 WITH THE SAME EXACT ISSUE AND ALL REPORT NO OTHER RUST ON THE VEHICLE EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE LOCATION.

FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE VEHICLE I HAVE NOTICED A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE HANDLING OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ENGAGE, BUT ALSO WITH A STIFFNESS THAT OCCURS IN THE BRAKE PEDAL WHEN IT IS DEPRESSED RAPIDLY.    THE ISSUES WITH THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM ARE BY FAR THE MOST DISCONCERTING.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN THE ABS ENGAGES THE VEHICLE CEASES TO SLOW DOWN. THIS WILL HAPPEN EVEN IN CONDITIONS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING SLOWLY. FOR INSTANCE, AT 10 MILES PER HOUR THE VEHICLE WILL SLIDE TWO TO THREE METERS WITHOUT SLOWING. THIS DISTANCE INCREASES WITH ADDITIONAL SPEED.   THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ENGAGE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE VEHICLE IS NOT SLIDING. THIS HAPPENS MOST COMMONLY ON ROUGH ROAD SURFACES. I HAVE EXPERIENCED DANGEROUS SITUATIONS WHERE I SLID INTO AN INTERSECTION, OR BEEN FORCED TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD TO AVOID VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE I HIT A BUMP.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE STIFFNESS IN THE BRAKE IS ALSO OF CONCERN TO ME. IF I AM TRYING TO SLOW THE VEHICLE WHILE TRAVELING DOWN HILL I FIND THAT THE BREAK BECOMES VERY STIFF. THIS CAN OFTEN LEAD TO THE SITUATION WHERE THE DANGEROUS ANTI-LOCK BRAKE PROBLEM OCCURS. THE PEDAL BECOMES VERY STIFF AND THEN IF I HIT A BUMP THE VEHICLE GOES OUT OF CONTROL CAUSING ME TO HAVE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION.

WE CALLED TOYOTA AND INQUIRED ABOUT A BUY BACK PROGRAM FOR 4RUNNERS, AS IT HAS THE SAME FRAME AS A TACOMA.  TACOMAS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR FRAME RUST.  TOYOTA INFORMED US THAT THE 4 RUNNER WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL PROGRAM,AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT HELP US RESOLVE THIS SAFETY PROBLEM.  WE SCHEDULED IT FOR REPAIR AT SHEPARD TOYOTA.  THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF A TACK WELDING OF A STEEL PLATE OVER THE RUST HOLES TO CONCEAL THEM, AND THEN SOMETHING BLACK WAS SPRAYED OVER IT.  THE STEEL REPAIR PLATE DOES NOT HAVE A CONTINUOUS WELD COMPLETELY AROUND IT.  THIS OVERSIGHT MIGHT ALLOW ACCELERATED CORROSION BY TRAPPING MOISTURE AND ROAD SALT BEHIND IT.  SHEPARD TOYOTA DEEMED THE VEHICLE SAFE AND IT PASSED THE MAINE SAFETY INSPECTION.  WE  CHARGED $166.50 FOR THIS SAFETY DEFECT REPAIR.    WE CHOSE THE 4 RUNNER WAS FOR ITS ABILITY TO TOW.  WE HAVE EXPLAINED TO TOYOTA THAT THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE AND THAT WE TOW HEAVY TRAILERS ON A REGULAR BASIS.  THE TRIGGER TO ALLOW A TACOMA OWNER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BUY BACK PROGRAM IS WHEN RUST HOLES APPEAR IN THE FRAME.  EVEN THOUGH OUR 4 RUNNER HAS 2 (NOW HIDDEN) RUST HOLES THROUGH THE FRAME, AND POSSIBLE HOLES CONCEALED BEHIND OTHER COMPONENTS SUCH AS THE FUEL TANK, TOYOTA IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  WE ARE ALSO WONDERING IF TOYOTA USES LESS CORROSION PROTECTION ON VEHICLES WITH CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS.  OUR 4RUNNER WAS RETRIEVED FROM ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER IN ANOTHER STATE AS OUR ORIGINAL DEALER DID NOT HAVE ONE IN STOCK.

THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE.
