THE TIRE AFTER INSPECTION ELICITED A RUBBER SEPARATION WHICH CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES TO MY TRUCK.  AFTER THE TIRE BLEWOUT ON INTERSTATE 64, I MAINTAIN ENOUGH CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE TO PULL IT OVER ONTO THE EMERGENCY LANE.  UNDER VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE BLOWN OUT TIRE, I NOTICED THE CENTER TREAD WHICH COMPLETELY TORN, SEPARATED FOR THE TIRE(PICTURES WERE TAKEN AND THE FLAT TIRE IS IN ITS SEPARATED FORM.) THE DAMAGES THAT WERE CAUSED BY THIS FLAT WERE A DAMAGED LEFT WHEEL CASING INCLUDING THE MUDFLAP AREA, THE LEFT REAR SIDE PANEL WAS DAMAGED, THE MUFFLER WAS ALSO DAMAGED ALONG WITH THE REAR BUMPER AND THE EXTERIOR AREA ADJACENT TO WHERE THE TIRE WAS \"BLOWN OFF\" AFTER THE FLAT SUFFERED DAMAGES TOO. THERE IS ALSO A NOISE THAT THE TRUCK MAKES THAT WAS PRESENT BEFORE THIS INCIDENT.  THERE IS LIKELY MORE DAMAGES TO MY TRUCK ALSO..  IT SEEMED EXTREMELY UNSUAL THAT A SIMPLE FLAT WOULD CAUSE SO MUCH DAMAGE THAT IS WHY IM CONTACTING YOUR ORGANIZATION FOR ASSISTANCE.  IM IN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING MICHELIN TIRES SUPPLYING THEM WITH SUFFICIENT DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG TO MY TIRE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND COOPERATION.
