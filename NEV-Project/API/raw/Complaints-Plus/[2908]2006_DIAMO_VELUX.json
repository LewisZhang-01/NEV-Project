THE MANUFACTURER CLAIMS THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, I HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THIS DEFECT IS NOT DUE TO WEAR AND TEAR OR ANY CONSUMER ERROR, AND SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER TO FIX SINCE IT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE ACCIDENTS.    THIS COMPLAINT IS ACTUALLY FOR A DIAMO RETRO MOPED, BUT THAT WASN'T A CHOICE ON THE LAST MENU, SO I CHOSE VELUX. *TR",

WINDSCREEN: ALL DIAMO VELUX BIKES (ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTOR - LS MOTORSPORTS) HAVE A STAIN ON THE WINDSHIELD CAUSED BY THE WIPER BLADE.  THIS IS DISTRACTING TO THE DRIVER.  HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS: MOTORCYCLISTS DEPEND ON AGILITY.  THIS BIKE IS UNSTABLE IN TURNS AND EXHIBITS A HIGH DEGREE OF INSTABILITY EVEN WHEN CHANGING LANES.
