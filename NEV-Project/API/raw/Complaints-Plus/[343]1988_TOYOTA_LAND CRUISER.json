HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SERVCO PUTS A TEN - YEAR CAP ON SSCS, SO EVEN IF THE FUEL TANK HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED, THEY WOULD NOT DO IT ANYWAY. MY VEHICLE HAS A VERY STRONG ODOR OF FUEL IN THE CAB, SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO TRACK DOWN THE SOURCE OF THE SMELL. THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT I HAVE A FAULTY \"VAPOR CONTROL VALVE\" WHICH THEY ARE GOING TO REPLACE.  I ASKED THE TECHNICIAN WHAT THE PART NUMBER WAS ON THE FUEL TANK THAT IS NOW ON MY VEHICLE AND HE GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING #: [XXX].
