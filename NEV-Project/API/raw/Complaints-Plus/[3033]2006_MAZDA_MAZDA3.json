THE SUMMERS IN AZ ARE REALLY HOT SO I'M NOT SURE IF THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT MAZDA CAN INVESTIGATE THIS AND PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT FOR THIS COMPONENT?",

BOTH O2 SENSORS WERE REPLACE PREVIOUSLY. THE MAIN CONCERN IS DANGEROUS AND HAS ALREADY ALMOST CAUSED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS WHILE  THE ISSUE HAS OCCURRED AFTER DRIVING FROM A STOPPED POSITION. THE ISSUE IS, WHEN THE VEHICLE STOPS AT 0 MPH, THE NORMAL IDLING RPM SPEED IS AROUND 750RPM. DURING STOPS LONGER THAN A SECOND, THE CAR WILL LOWER THE IDLE RPMS TO ABOUT 500RPM AND STAY UNTIL THE THROTTLE IS ENGAGED. WHEN THE THROTTLE IS ENGAGED THE VEHICLE HESITATES AND COMES CLOSE TO STALLING. THE VEHICLE WILL NOT POWER THE WHEELS ABOVE ABOUT 1000RPMS WHEN THE THROTTLE IS FULLY DEPRESSED AND THE CAR WILL HESITATE UNTIL THE CAR STARTS TO GRADUALLY MOVE FORWARD. THIS ALL IS HAPPENING IN THE INTERSECTION. AS THE CAR GETS TO THE INTERSECTION, THE CAR STARTS TO PICK UP TO ABOUT 1000 TO 1500RPM AND ONLY THEN WILL THE CAR START TO FULLY DRIVE FORWARD WITHOUT RELATION TO DRIVER'S FORCED DEPRESSION OF THE THROTTLE. BASICALLY THE VEHICLE IS DEFIANTLY NOT GOING ABOVE 1500RPM UNTIL THE VEHICLE IS A CERTAIN WAYS FORWARD.

(PART 1) RE: UNKNOWN/OR OTHER: AS A RESULT OF HAVING MY POWER STEERING ISSUE REPAIRED (INITIAL COMPLAINT), I WAS TOLD AFTER THE REPAIR BY A MR. CARLETON AT LIBERTY MAZDA, WAKEFIELD, MA, THAT WHEN MY RIGHT DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL IS TURNED ON, IT NOW CONTINUOUSLY CLICKS EXTREMELY FAST (CODE B2899 RT DIRECTIONAL - EST FOR DIRECTIONAL WIRING TO JUST START TO LOCATE THE ISSUE IS LISTED ON THE SUBMITTED DIAGNOSTIC REPORT IS $220.00) BUT THAT IT SHOULDN'T EFFECT ME GETTING A NEW CAR INSPECTION STICKER OR ANYTHING, SO I HAD TO DECLINE FIXING DUE TO COST. (THIS ISSUE IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL DIAGNOSTIC REPORT AS WELL, THAT I HAVE FAXED AND MAILED TO YOU.) I AM ALSO UNABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE THIS ISSUE FIXED AS WELL, AND FOR THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM DID NOT EXIST AT ALL BEFORE I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN TO HAVE THE POWER STEERING FIXED AND THIS ISSUE APPEARED AFTER THAT, THIS SHOULD BE COVERED IN FULL AND FIXED BY MANUFACTURER; 3. (PART 2.) CONTINUOUS ISSUE BEGINNING ROUGHLY 3-4 WEEKS OF PURCHASE (BOUGHT BRAND NEW, NOT USED): CLOCK IN VEHICLE IS SET TO THE PROPER TIME, BUT WILL ONLY LAST A MONTH MAYBE AT VERY MOST BEFORE IT CHANGES AUTO AND DISPLAYS A RANDOM TIME.",

THE POWER STEERING LOSS HAS OCCURRED AT A VARIETY OF SPEEDS, RANGING FROM 25 TO 70 MPH, AND HAS LED TO A JERKING OF THE WHEEL AND A POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION ON THE FREEWAY.  ON AVERAGE IT OCCURS ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE PER DAY, SO ROUGHLY EVERY 20-30 MILES ON AVERAGE.  I HAVE SEEN OTHER SIMILAR REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM FOR 2006 MAZDA3'S, AND A RECALL FOR THE 2007-2009 MODELS.  THEREFORE I AM HOPEFUL THAT 2006 MAZDA3S WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AS WELL TO AVOID POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

I WAS ABLE TO USE THE TOP OF MY FOOT TO LIFT THE CLUTCH UP WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND IT WOULD POP BACK UP.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP WHICH, I WAS CURRENTLY ABOUT 2 MILES FROM. I EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE MORNING.  I DROVE HOME ABOUT 3 MILES.  THE NEXT DAY I CALLED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.  NO ONE RETURNED MY PHONE CALL, SO I STARTED TO DRIVE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT BECAME MORE DIFFICULT TO SHIFT INTO GEAR, THAN I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY AFTER ONLY DRIVING ABOUT 3 MILES AND ONLY ABOUT 3 TRAFFIC LIGHTS.  AFTER THAT, I COULD PUT THE STICK SHIFT INTO GEAR BUT WHEN I LIFTED THE CLUTCH UP IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE.    I BOUGHT MY CAR BRAND NEW AT MAZDA AND HAD ALL MY REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTIONS AT THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP ASIDE FROM REGULAR OIL CHANGES WHICH, I GOT DONE AT A LOCAL SHOP.  I HAVE ALWAYS DRIVEN A STICK SHIFT AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH CLUTCHES.  I WAS ALSO THE SOLE DRIVER OF MY CAR.     WHEN I GOT HOME I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND SOMEONE RECOMMENDED FILLING OUT A COMPLAINT AT THIS WEBSITE.  IF I HAD NOT STUMBLED ACROSS THAT I WOULD BE NONE THE WISER. WHILE LOOKING OVER THE SITE, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A RECENT INVESTIGATION OF MAZDA RX8.  IT STATED THAT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION, MAZDA HAS INFORMED ODI THAT IT CONDUCTED AN OWNER NOTIFICATION OF AN EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE PROGRAM INCREASING THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY WARRANTY TO 8 YEARS AND LIMITED AT 100K MILES FOR MODEL YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2009 RX8 VEHICLES.  MY QUESTION IS, HOW CAN A CLUTCH HAVE A LIFETIME OF 100,000 MILES IN AN RX8 WHICH IS A SPORTIER CAR AND PROBABLY RECEIVES MORE ABUSE THAN OTHER MODELS AND ONLY GOOD FOR 12,000 IN A 2006 MAZDA 3/HATCHBACK?  COULD YOU LOOK INTO ALL MODELS.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

I HAD MY CRUISE CONTROL ON ABOUT 63 MPH AND HAD BEEN TRAVELING BEHIND A TRACTOR TRAILER TRUCK FOR APPROX. TWO MILES BEFORE I REACHED MY EXIT.  I PULLED OVER INTO THE EXIT LANE AND HIT MY BRAKES AND NOTHING HAPPENED!  I HIT THEM AGAIN AND NOTHING.  I HIT MY ON/OFF CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH AND THE DECELERATION SWITCHES AND NOTHING HAPPENED.  I PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE AND HIT MY HORN AND ENTERED A FIVE LANE INTERSECTION AT THE END OF AN UPHILL EXIT RAMP ON A RED LIGHT DOING IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH!!!  I KNEW I WAS GOING TO DIE OR BE PHYSICALLY INJURED AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WOULD TAKE WITH ME AS I HAD NO WAY TO SLOW OR STOP THE CAR.  LOOKING BACK, I KNOW I HAD NO MORE THAN 10 OR 12 SECONDS TO REACT BEFORE I WAS AT THE TOP OF THE EXIT RAMP GOING THAT FAST.  I TURNED TO THE RIGHT AS I ENTERED THE INTERSECTION TO AVOID CARS THAT WERE ENTERING AND I THINK MY CAR SPUN AROUND AND I WAS HIT BY A PICKUP TRUCK IN THE INNER LANE WHO PROBABLY HAD NO IDEA WHERE I CAME FROM.  I THEN WENT HEAD-ON INTO ANOTHER CAR TRAVELING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  MY CAR WAS TOTALED, THE ONE I HIT HEAD-ON WAS TOTALED BUT THE PICKUP TRUCK WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AWAY FROM THE ACCIDENT.  ALL OF US WERE ABLE TO WALK AWAY - ME VERY SHAKILY.  I HAD SEATBELT BRUISES AND AIR BAG BURNS AND ALL OF MY MUSCLES WERE SORE, BUT I AM GETTING BETTER EACH DAY.  I STILL HAVE PAIN AND TIGHTNESS IN MY CHEST AREA, BUT FROM WHAT I AM LEARNING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF INJURY IT MAY STAY WITH ME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

THE MILEAGE WAS 25,675, 4/18/08, WHEN SPEEDEE CHANGED THE OIL AND IT WAS 26,402, 4/25/08,WHEN I TOOK THE CAR INTO TRACY MAZDA SO THEY COULD CHECK ON THE TICKING NOISE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FINALLY GOT BACK TO ME SEVERAL DAYS LATER AND SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE A ROD KNOCK FROM CYL #1.  THEY ASKED FOR THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS WHICH I THEN PROVIDED, EXCEPT FOR ONE OIL CHANGE WHICH I HAD PERFORMED MYSELF ( MINUS THE FILTER WHICH REQUIRED A SPECIAL TOOL).  ON 5/13/08 TRACY MAZDA'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED AND INFORMED ME THEY WOULD NOT FIX THE VEHICLE UNDER THE WARRANTY. IT WAS GOING TO COST ME APPROXIMATELY $6,000.00 TO FIX A CAR THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE 30,000 MILES ON IT. I DECLINED TO HAVE THEM FIX IT RIGHT THEN AND WENT AND GOT THE CAR.     I HAD THE FIRST TWO OIL CHANGES PERFORMED AT TRACY MAZDA'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THE NEXT WAS PERFORMED BY SPEEDEE OIL CHANGERS.  AFTER THAT I CHANGED THE OIL MYSELF.  THE FIFTH OIL CHANGE WAS ON 4/18/08, WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO SPEED. THE MILEAGE BETWEEN THE TWO SPEED CHANGES WAS 14,458.  I PERFORMED ONE OIL CHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO DOCUMENTED WHICH WOULD MAKE IT APPROXIMATELY 7,200 MILES BETWEEN THE TWO.  THIS IS A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT IS SUGGESTED BETWEEN OIL CHANGES BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT MAZDA DECLINING WARRANTY REPAIR.

I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS SITUATION RESOLVED AT ONCE SO THAT I CAN GO ON WITH MY LIFE WITHOUT THE WORRY OF PAYING FOR A LEMON CAR AND STOP HAVING TO DRIVE AROUND IN A RENTAL CAR THAT IS LESS FUEL EFFICIENT AND LESS COMFORTABLE THAN MY CAR.  THERE ARE THREE MAJOR REASONS I REQUESTED SERVICE FOR MY CAR:  1. THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT HAS BEEN COMING ON RANDOMLY.  2. ON ONE OCCASION THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED ON AN ONCOMING RAMP OF RT. 202 TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES PER HOUR. I COULD HARDLY PULL THE CAR OVER BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TOO HEAVY TO OPERATE. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  3. ANOTHER MAJOR REASON FOR MY SAFETY WORRIES IS THAT THE SIDE AIRBAG OFF LIGHT STARTED TO COME ON CONSTANTLY.  AFTER AN EXPERT VISIT, I WAS TOLD THAT I WILL BE GETTING A NEW CAR. 2 WEEKS AFTER THAT THE PAPERWORK PROCESSES WAS COMPLETED  A NEW CAR WAS READY FOR ME TO PICK UP, SO I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO PICK UP MY CAR ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT  I HAD TO PAY $2,300 IN ORDER TO TAKE THE NEW CAR.  THEN THE NEXT DAY I WAS TOLD BY YOU ON THE PHONE THAT THE DEAL WAS CANCELLED BY MAZDA BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR THIS UNFAIR RESOLUTION. THEN THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP PERSONALLY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THEY NEEDED TO PURCHASE MY CAR, SELL IT TO ANOTHER CONSUMER AND THEN SELL ME A NEW CAR. THERE ARE TWO THINGS UNETHICAL ABOUT THIS:  1. YOU CANNOT SELL A CAR WITH SAFETY DEFECTS TO ANOTHER CONSUMER.  2. YOU CANNOT LEAVE ME WITH NO OPTION BUT TO TRADE IN MY CAR AND PURCHASE A NEW CAR WHEN THIS CAR IS A LEMON.   BASED ON THE PENNSYLVANIA ATTORNEY GENERAL DESCRIPTION MY CAR IS A LEMON CAR. I FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THAT IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE IN THIS MATTER AND HAVE YET TO SEE ANY RESULTS.  *JB",

I'VE GOT AN ATTORNEY NOW AND GOING THROUGH LEMON LAW PROCEDURES.  WE DID GIVE MAZDA SEVERAL EXTRA CHANCES TO FIX IT AND HAVE THEIR ZONE MANAGER AND HIS TECH REP AND A MAZDA ENGINEER THAT DROVE DOWN FROM MICHIGAN, A CHANCE TO TEST DRIVE THE CAR.  ON THE LAST VISIT THEY CONFIRMED 2 OTHER NEW MAZDA 3'S DROVE LIKE MINE DID, I.E. THEY PULLED LEFT.  ON PREVIOUS VISITS I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM WITH 3 OTHER NEW MAZDA 3'S THAT THEY DID NOT PULL LEFT.  BASICALLY IF YOU LET GO OF THE WHEEL, ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR WILL QUICKLY GO LEFT AND LEAVE YOUR CURRENT LANE.  I'VE HAD AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC VERIFY THIS AS WELL.  MAZDA IS NOW TAKING THE POSITION THAT THE MAZDA 3 IS A 'SPORTY' CAR AND HAS A WEAK ON-CENTER STEERING FEEL AND THAT JUST THE WAY THEIR CARS ARE AND ITS NOT A DEFECT.  BUT AS I MENTIONED I'VE CONFIRMED ON MULTIPLE OTHER VISITS, WITH THEIR TECH PEOPLE, DRIVING OTHER NEW MAZDA 3'S THAT THE OTHER NEW CARS DID NOT PULL LEFT SO AT THE LEAST THEY HAVE A PROBLEM TURNING OUT CARS THAT VARY FROM CAR TO CAR.  NO OTHER CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN DRIVES THIS WAY AND PULLS LEFT WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE WHEEL.  I'M AN ENGINEER AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE THAT NHTSA MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO.  BECAUSE THE CAR IS A UNIBODY IT HS NO CAMBER ADJUSTMENT SO THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FIX THIS DEFECT ONCE THE CAR HAS BEEN MADE.  *NM",
