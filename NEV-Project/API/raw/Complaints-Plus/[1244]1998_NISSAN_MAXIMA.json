AFTER DIAGNOSING THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULE IN THE SEAT TO BE CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I FOUND A NISSAN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN, NTB00-043, APPLYING TO ALL 1998-1999 NISSAN MAXIMA VEHICLES, WHICH STATES THAT THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULES FOR THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER FRONT SEATS ARE TO BE REPLACED WITH NEW UPDATED ONES THAT REPLACE THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULES AND THE SEAT-SUB HARNESS THAT THE MODULES CONNECT TO.  THIS IS A MANUFACTURING SAFETY DEFECT IN THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULE'S HARNESS.  THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN STATES TO ROUTE THE NEW HARNESS EXACTLY AS THE OLD HARNESS WAS ROUTED, THEREFORE ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY OF THE HARNESS ROUTING IN THE SEAT BEING THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN STATES THAT THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULE INSTALLED ORIGINALLY IN THE VEHICLE CONSISTS OF A TWO PIECE HARNESS; THE AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE WITH A SHORT SECTION OF WIRE THAT CONNECTS INTO A SUB HARNESS THAT IS ROUTED THROUGH THE SEAT, WHERE IT IS CONNECTED TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM CIRCUIT.  THE UPDATED SIDE AIRBAG MODULE ELIMINATES THE TWO-PIECE HARNESS SYSTEM, REPAIRING THE SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM FAULT AND THEREFORE ELIMINATING THE WARNING INDICATOR CONSTANTLY FLASHING.  THIS REQUIRES THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULES, WHICH IS VERY COSTLY AND THIS ISSUE CREATES A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE REGARDING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAIN SYSTEM IF EVER REQUIRED TO BE USED.  IN ADDITION, NISSAN DOES NOT OFFER  THE SIDE AIRBAG MODULES FOR PURCHASE TO MY EXTENT OF KNOWLEDGE.  AFTER CONDUCTING MY OWN RESEARCH ON WEBSITES FOR NISSAN MAXIMA OWNERS, THIS APPEARS TO BE AN EXTREMELY COMMON ISSUE THAT OCCURS ON THE 1998-1999 NISSAN MAXIMA VEHICLES. *TR",

THE REPAIR SHOP GUESSED MY PROBLEM BEFORE EXAMINING THE CAR, STATING HE SAW IT ALL THE TIME.   HE SHOWED ME A PACKAGE OF SMALL PARTS FROM NISSAN CORP.WHICH HE SAID THEY SENT OUT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.  HE EXPLAINED NISSAN CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION  STYLE FOR APPROX. A 3 YEAR PERIOD (96-98?), USING A SOLENOID (I BELIEVE) THAT HE SAID \"FAILED IN ALL CARS MADE WHEN THE CARS REACHED 80,000 MILES.\"  HE SAID THE CARS MADE BEFORE AND AFTER THE 3 YEARS DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.    MY CAR WAS 3 1/2 YEARS OLD AND HAD 67,525 MILES. THE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTYDIDN'T COVER THE CARSINCE IT WAS MORE THAN 3 YRS OLD AND HAD MORE THAN 60K MILES.

DUE TO THE REPAIR SHOP'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY INSPECTION, THEIR POSSESSION OF 'NISSAN FIXER KIT', AND PROBABLE LRG % OF CARS WITH SAME PROBLEM, I THINK NISSAN BUILT A FAULTY CAR COMPONENT, KNEW ABOUT IT,AND EVEN DESIGNED THE TRANNY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE CAR ORIGINALLY. I EXPERIENCED NO ACCIDENT OR INJURY, BUT IF THE PARTS CAME LOOSE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD CAUSE VERY QUICK 'SEIZING' STOPS WITH NO WARNING (BRAKE LIGHTS), AND POSSIBLE PROJECTILE LIKE BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTS.
