What does it take to get this NOTICED by MOPAR this is obviously a safety hazard.  I bet if one of MOPAR's dependents was driving a 2013 Dodge Avenger they would get it fixed TODAY for free via a recall are you listening MOPAR???  I am sure you read these complaints.  I will contact a Chrysler dealer in the area and see if they will do the right thing and fix this safety issue for free but after reading all these complaints looks like a losing battle.  MOPAR is you want to have customers buy your cars do the right thing a get a recall out on this airbag issue.",

I did some research and found a recall on similar car, the 2013 Dodge Dart:  2013 DODGE DART  Report Date: April 11, 2019 Campaign Number: 19V293000 Component: POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION:LEVER AND LINKAGE:FLOOR SHIFT  Summary: Chrysler (FCA US LLC) is recalling certain 2013-2016 Dodge Dart vehicles equipped with 6-speed automatic transmissions. The shifter cable bushing may fail allowing the shift cable to detach from the transmission.  Consequence Summary: If the shifter cable detaches from the transmission, the vehicle may not perform the shifts performed by the driver. Additionally, despite selecting PARK with the shifter, the vehicle may roll away. These scenarios may increase the risk of a crash.  Corrective Summary: Chrysler will notify owners, and dealers will replace the transmission side shifter cable bushing, free of charge. The recall began September 5, 2019. Owners may contact Chrysler customer service at 1-800-853-1403. Chrysler's number for this recall is V34.",

HAVING THE NECESSARY HEAT IS THE ONLY WAY IN COLD WEATHER TO KEEP THE WINDSHIELD FROM FOGGING AND FROM BEING ICED OVER IN WINTER STORMS. I HAVE EXPERIENCE THIS AND HAD TO PULL OVER AND CLEAN MY WINDSHIELD OTHERWISE THE DRIVING WAS DANGEROUS.    THIS PROBLEM OCCURS WHILE DRIVING AND EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY BECAUSE NO HEAT COMES OUT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE INTERIOR. THIS LACK OF HEAT CAUSED ICE AND FOG TO BE AN ISSUE ON MY CAR IN NUMEROUS SITUATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE 2018-2019 WINTER IN MINNESOTA. I DROVE ON HWY 169 FOR JUST 5-20 MILES AND WAS FORCED TO PULL OVER DUE TO LACK OF HEAT AND BUILD UP OF FOG AND ICE.  I AM VERY SURE FROM READING OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS.   AS MENTIONED, THIS PROBLEM IS CHRONIC AND A SIMPLE PART REPLACEMENT WONT SOLVE THE RECURRING PROBLEM.     IF THERE IS ANY WAY A REPLACEMENT HEATER CORE PLUS A NEW TYPE OF COOLANT CAN BE BROUGHT FORWARD AS A RECALL FIX, THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE CONSISTENT AND CHRONIC FAILURE OF THE HEATER CORE CAN BE FIXED AND LOTS OF PEOPLE NEED THIS. PLEASE HELP, THANK YOU.",

I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULDN'T TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IT WASN'T DOING IT RIGHT AT THAT TIME. I HAVE A FRIEND THAT HAD THE SAME KIND OF CAR AND ACTUALLY GOT A RID OF IT THROUGH THE LEMON LAW BECAUSE IT DID THE SAME THING. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE CAR JUST STOPS AND THE WAY I GO TO WORK THERE IS RARELY SOMEWHERE TO PULL OVER LEAVING ME SITTING IN MOVING TRAFFIC BUT I'M NOT MOVING. THERE IS NO CORRELATION REGARDING THE SPEED OR THE TYPE OF ROAD I AM TRAVELING. IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THIS TIME THAT IT WAS APPROX THE SAME SPEED AND SAME ROAD.

FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ROOM IN THE OTHER LANE NEXT TO ME AND I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE LANES AVOIDING AN ACCIDENT.  BUT THE BRAKE SYSTEM DID NOT ACT PROPERLY.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TWO ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS WHERE \"EMERGENCY BRAKING\" WAS NECESSARY.  IN ALL THREE CASES THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM BRAKING FORCE (CONSIDERABLY LESS BRAKING THAN A MINIVAN I OWN).  IN ADDITION, IN NONE OF THE 3 CASES DID THE ABS ENGAGE (PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE MAXIMUM BRAKING FORCE COULD NOT BE ATTAINED!).   I HAVE COMPARED THE BRAKE PEDAL FEEL TO OTHER CARS I OWN, AND OTHER NEW DODGE CARS (I RENTED A CHRYSLER 300 FOR TWO WEEKS AND A DODGE CHALLENGER FOR 2 WEEKS) AND HAVE FOUND THAT THE BRAKES ON THE AVENGER ARE VERY \"SPONGY\" AS IF THERE IS AIR IN THE LINES. AT LOW SPEEDS THE SOFT FEEL OF THE BRAKES IS SOMEWHAT MASKED.  AT HIGHER SPEEDS AND/OR EMERGENCY CONDITIONS, THE BRAKES REQUIRE EXTRA INPUT AND PEDAL TRAVEL TO PROVIDE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BRAKING FORCE WHEN THE BRAKING FORCE SHOULD INCREASE ON THE CAR.

AROUND 12/5/2013, I TOOK THE CAR BACK ONCE AGAIN AND I SPOKE TO A TECH AROUND 6PM AND HE TOLD ME THAT CHRYSLER USES \"SNOWMOBILE TYPE TRANSMISSIONS\" AND THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS SHIFT ROUGHLY, HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS NO FIX. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT SERVICE MY CAR AT THAT TIME OF DAY. ON 12/11/2013 THEY DID A WHEEL ROTATION AND AN ALIGNMENT, THE CAR STOPPED PULLING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, PULLING IS VERY SLIGHT NOW, POSSIBLY DUE TO NEEDING ANOTHER ALIGNMENT NOW.  I HAVE AN ISSUE WHERE I WILL ALSO BE TRAVELING IN WHAT SHOULD BE THIRD GEAR SHIFTING TO FOURTH (ATTEMPTING TO PICK UP SPEED QUICKLY, USUALLY THRUWAYS) AND THERE ARE TIMES THAT THE CAR WILL NOT PICK UP SPEED QUICKLY, AS IF IT WAS SITTING IN SIXTH GEAR RATHER THAN THIRD OR FOURTH. THIS ISSUE IS NOT ALWAYS PRESENT AND I HAVE DECIDED TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH THE AUTO STICK SINCE THERE IS NO FAILURE IN SHIFTING THIS WAY.  THE ROUGH-SHIFTING TRANSMISSION IS SOMETHING THAT CHRYSLER HAS KNOWN ABOUT IN THE DODGE AVENGERS FOR A LONG TIME BUT THEY SEEM TO DISREGARD THEIR AVENGER OWNERS.   *JS",
