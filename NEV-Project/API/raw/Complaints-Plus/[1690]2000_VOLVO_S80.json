MY CONCERN IS IF THE MATERIAL USED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE FUEL PUMP CHANGED FROM S80 2000 TO 2001 MODELS. I WOULD LIKE TO BE NOTIFIED WHAT MATERIAL WAS USED FOR S80 2000 MODELS VERSUS THE MATERIAL USED FOR S80 2001 MODELS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIAL FOR S80 2000 MODELS \"MAY NOT DEVELOP CRACKS DUE TO EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND VARYING FUEL QUALITY\" AS DOES THE S80 2001 MATERIAL.

PARTICULARLY CONCERNING TO ME FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT WAS THAT SEVERAL TIMES, INCLUDING WHEN I WAS IN HIGHWAY DRIVING SITUATIONS, THE CAR ON ITS OWN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DECELERATED, HESITATED ON ACCELERATION OR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE, AND DISPLAYED ENGINE STALL SYMPTOMS.  THE COMPUTER INDICATED DEGRADED ENGINE PERFORMANCE (LIMP MODE). I LINED UP A SERVICE APPOINTMENT WITH LOVERING VOLVO OF MEREDITH. AFTER LOVERING'S FIRST ATTEMPT AT REPAIRS, THE CAR WAS STILL NOT OPERATING NORMALLY AND I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER A SECOND TIME.  I PAID A TOTAL OF $2,074.42 FOR REPAIRS, $1,741.44 THE FIRST TIME AND $332.98 DURING THE SECOND VISIT.      IN ACCORDANCE WITH A JUNE 2006 VOLVO LETTER, I TOOK MY S80 BACK TO LOVERING FOR INSPECTION AND ETS SOFTWARE UPGRADE.  I SUBMITTED TO VOLVO A CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR ETS REPAIRS. THE ADVERTISING CHECKING BUREAU (ACB), WHICH ADMINISTERS THE ETS WARRANTY REBATE PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF VOLVO, SENT ME A CHECK FOR $747.93 FOR THE ETS REPAIRS. ACB SAID IT WAS AUTHORIZED TO REIMBURSE ME ONLY THE $587.93 COST OF ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY, ELECTRONIC THROTTLE MODULE RELOAD, AND GASKET, AND ASSOCIATED $160.00 LABOR COST. ACB ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THE VOLVO CUSTOMER CARE CENTER.  A VOLVO CUSTOMER CARE REPRESENTATIVE CONFIRMED THAT ACB HAD DONE AS INSTRUCTED AND SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE UP THE MATTER OF THE REMAINING REPAIR COSTS WITH LOVERING.     THE LOVERING INVOICES, DATED JULY 26, 2005 AND AUGUST 8, 2005, INDICATE THAT A $295.65 PORTION OF THE INITIAL $1,741.44 REPAIR BILL HAD TO DO WITH TOTALLY UNRELATED STEERING/SUSPENSION AND ENGINE MOUNT REPAIRS. STILL QUESTIONABLE IN MY MIND ARE THE OXYGEN SENSOR REPAIRS WHICH ADDED UP TO $897.86 AND THE SUBSEQUENT MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR REPAIRS WHICH CAME TO $332.98.  I SUSPECT THE PROBLEMS ARE ALL ETS-RELATED AND I AM CURRENTLY PURSUING THE MATTER WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  *NM",

MY HUSBAND PRESENTED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WITH A PUBLICATION FROM THE HIGHWAY SAFETY BOARD WHICH DISCUSSED A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODY ON THE VOLVO S80.  AS WE WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS DESCRIBED IN THIS PUBLICATION, MY HUSBAND ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY ON OUR VEHICLE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT AS VOLVO HAD NOT ISSUED A RECALL, THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO REPLACE THIS WITHOUT THE VOLVO WARRANTY COMPANY REVIEWING THIS ISSUE WITH OUR VEHICLE.  THE WARRANTY COMPANY DID EXAMINE OUR VEHICLE, BUT DECLINED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY AT THAT TIME.  ON DECEMBER 11, 2005 MY FAMILY (HUSBAND AND TWO CHILDREN, AGES 2 AND 10 MONTHS) WERE TRAVELING HOME TO THE ATLANTA AREA FROM NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE.  WHILE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE, I NOTICED THAT IT BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AND DECELERATE AND THEN COMPLETELY LOST POWER.  WE WERE TRAVELING ON I-75 SOUTH AT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND WERE ABLE TO GET TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD TO PULL OVER ONTO THE LEFT SHOULDER AS THE TWO RIGHT LANES WERE IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE. WE WERE THEN ENDANGERED BY TRAFFIC MERGING TO THE LEFT WHICH IN SOME CASES ATTEMPTED TO PASS ON THE LEFT SHOULDER.  WE HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO NALLEY VOLVO IN MARIETTA, GEORGIA WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 34 MILES FROM WHERE WE ORIGINALLY BROKE DOWN. AS THIS HAPPENED ON A SUNDAY EVENING AND NO RENTAL CAR BUSINESSES WERE OPENED, WE THEN HAD TO GET A TAXI TO TAKE US THE REST OF THE WAY TO OUR HOME.

I ALSO STATED THAT I AM DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT QUALITY AND I MAY NOT CONSIDER BUYING ANOTHER VOLVO PRODUCT.

ANOTHER INSTANCE, THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE AUTOMATIC STEERING. TODAY I WENT TO START MY CAR AND A WARNING MESSAGE CAME UP SAYING \"LOW BATTERY VOLTAGE\" AND MY CAR DID NOT FEEL RIGHT WHEN I DROVE IT.  I NEVER LEFT ANY LIGHTS ON OR ANYTHING OF THAT MATTER THAT WOULD CAUSE A DRAIN IN THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY WAS JUST REPLACED NOT TOO LONG AGO.  I THINK THAT WAS MY BREAKING POINT WITH THIS CAR.

I PULLED THE HOOD RELEASE LEVER INSIDE THE VEHICLE, GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND ATTEMPTED TO RELEASE THE HOOD SAFETY LATCH WHICH WAS SO HOT THAT MY HAND WITHDREW INVOLUNTARILY.

I WAS DISMAYED, AS THE CAR GAVE NO SAFETY INDICATORS (COMPUTERIZED) THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG PRIOR TO STEERING FAILURE.  I HAD NOTICED A LITTLE NOISE FROM THE FRONT SUSPENSION, BUT HAD PREVIOUSLY REPLACED RIGHT SIDE ENGINE BOLTS.  I CALLED VOLVO USA AFTER LOOKING AT THE NHTSA WEB SITE AND FINDING MANY, MANY COMPLAINTS POSTED WITH MY SAME PROBLEMS.  VOLVO USA TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD CHANGED MANUFACTURERS FOR THE RACK AND PINION SINCE MY 2000 S80 T6 WAS BUILT BUT WOULD NOT SAY WHY.  THIS SEEMS VERY SUSPICIOUS.  I ALSO HAVE HAD SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN BACKING THE CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE (COLD ENGINE), WHERE THE BRAKES FAIL TO STOP THE CAR FOR SEVERAL SECONDS (FEET).  THIS WAS ALSO A COMPLAINT POSTED TO THE NHTSA SITE.  I'M EXPERIENCING WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH MY VOLVO S80 AND WORRY THAT THERE IS AN OVERALL PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 S80 CARS.

IN TWENTY OR MORE CARS I HAVE OWNED, HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A SEVERE SAFETY CONCERN IN NEED OF CORRECTION. SUN GLASSES DO NOT HELP, NOR DOES PLACING A PIECE OF DARK CLOTH ON DASHBOARD.

SIMILARLY, AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY HAZARD EXISTS ON THE DASH BOARD AND INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE DARK BACKGROUND AND L.E.D. LIGHTING IS ALMOST INVISIBLE DURING DAYLIGHT (ALTHOUGH FINE AT NIGHT). IN ORDER TO READ ITEMS ON DASH SUCH AS RADIO STATION IN TUNE OR , MESSAGE BOARD, EYES MUST BE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD AND ONE MUST ACTUALLY BEND DOWN TO LOOK AT THE PANEL CLOSELY IN ORDER TO SEE WHEN IN BRIGHT LIGHT. A  HAZARD INDEED, BUT ONE I HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH....I JUST DO NOT TRY TO READ RADIO STATION INFO. I URGE TESTING OF THIS AUTO (IN THE COLOR AND DASH COLOR SPECIFIED)WHILE  DRIVING  INTO  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. HOWEVER, I URGE YOUR TESTER TO DRIVE SLOWLY!! ALSO, PLEASE TEST IN DAPPLED BRIGHT SUN/SHADE; OR DRIVE FROM SUNLIGHT INTO A DARKENED GARAGE. ONE IS ALMOST TOTALLY BLIND. VOLVO HAS SHOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT WITH A QUALITY AUTOMOBILE THAT IS VIRTUALLY UNDRIVEABLE IN DAYLIGHT SUNSHINE.*AK",
