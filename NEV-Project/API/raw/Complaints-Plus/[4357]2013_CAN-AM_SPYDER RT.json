THIS IS IN ADDITION TO HEAT AND GAS VAPOR ISSUES WHEN THE AMBIENT OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS 75 DEGREES AND ABOVE.      YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 27 OCTOBER 2014, I TOOK THE SPYDER ON A RIDE YESTERDAY OF ABOUT 30 MILES ON LOCAL ROADS.

AFTER 4 ATTEMPTS, I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET IT STARTED. I AM FORTUNATE THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN OUT ON THE ROAD.    THE SPYDER HAD A STRONG GAS VAPOR SMELL, WHICH WAS STILL EVIDENT THE MORNING IN MY GARAGE. I CHECKED THE SPYDER THIS MORNING AND IT STARTED WITH NO PROBLEM. I SUSPECT THE ECM AND PURGE VALVE CODES THAT THE B.U.D.S. COMPUTER DETECTED ARE TO BLAME, BUT THE HEAT ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT BRP NEEDS TO ADDRESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE SEVERE HEAT AND GASOLINE ODOR PROBLEMS WHICH I DESCRIBED IN EARLIER COMPLAINTS, THE VEHICLE HAS BECOME VERY HARD TO START WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARM. NORMAL IDLE RPM IS 1,300 TO 1,400. WHEN THIS CONDITION OCCURS - AS IT HAS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS - THE RPM DOES NOT EXCEED 500, AND THERE IS LIMITED THROTTLE RESPONSE. THE ENGINE STALLS, AND THERE IS AN OVERPOWERING ODOR OF GASOLINE EMANATING FROM THE VEHICLE AS IF THE THROTTLE BODY IS BEING FLOODED WITH GASOLINE. THE DEALER AND BRP (BOMBARDIER RECREATIONAL PRODUCTS) HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. BRP  HAS PROPOSED THAT MY DEALER REPLACE THE PURGE VALVE AND OXYGEN SENSOR TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED HEAT PROBLEM. I AM WAITING FOR THE DEALER TO OBTAIN THE REPAIR PARTS. I WAS TOLD BY A REPRESENTATIVE FROM BRP THAT IF THESE REPAIRS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEMS, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THAT THEY COULD DO TO ADDRESS THEM. I, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MAY DESIGN FLAWS WITH THIS VEHICLE. THE FRAME FOR THE 2013 RT WAS INTENDED TO HAVE A NEW ENGINE, A 1330 CC INLINE THREE CYLINDER RATHER THAN THE 998 CC V-TWIN. THE BRP REPRESENTATIVE ADMITTED TO ME THAT THE NEW ENGINE FOR THIS VEHICLE \"WAS NOT READY\" AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION OF THE 2013 MODEL, AND THEY WERE FORCED TO USE THE OLDER ENGINE. THIS ENGINE RUNS VERY HOT, AND BEING FULLY ENCLOSED BY PLASTIC PANELS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM. IT IS INFURIATING TO SPEND $27,000.00 ON A VEHICLE WHOSE PROBLEMS ARE NOT BEING PROACTIVELY ADDRESSED BY BRP. THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM WAS AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS, YET MADE NO MENTION OF THEM AT THE TIME OF THE SALE.

STARTING IN THE SPRING I STARTED NOTICING A STRONG GASOLINE SMELL AND EXTREME EXCESSIVE HEAT. FUEL CAP IS EXTREMELY HOT  AND GAS IS BOILING WHICH MAKE FILLING HARD AS NOZZLE KEEPS SHUTTING OFF. THIS IS OCCURRING IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AS LOW 53 DEGREES.  THE RECALL AND ALL SERVICE BULLETINS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND THE FUEL CANISTER HAS BEEN REPLACED IN SEPTEMBER 2014. WITHIN 200 MILES, THE GAS SMELL RETURNED AND IS NOTICEABLE BY MY HUSBAND RIDING BEHIND ME AT 15 MPH. WHEN STOPPED IN TRAFFIC THE SMELL IS OVERWHELMING. THE EXTREME HEAT CONTINUES AND I TO WEAR EXTRA PROTECTION ON MY LEGS.   I HAVE KEPT OUR DEALER ADVISED OF THE HEAT ISSUES.  *TR",

IN WARMER WEATHER 80 DEGREES F. OR MORE IT ACTUALLY BECOMES PAINFUL TO BARE SKIN.  IT BECOMES SO HOT YOU MUST MOVE YOUR LEG AWAY AND INTO THE WIND TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF.

DURING ONE OF MY FIRST TIMES REFUELING WHILE  LOOSENING THE GAS CAP MY HANDS WERE WASHED WITH FUEL THAT WAS  EXPELLED UNDER PRESSURE, SOAKING MY GLOVES. AFTERWARD I WAS CAREFUL  TO OPEN THE CAP SLOWLY (LIKE A COKE CAN UNDER PRESSURE) TO RELIEVE THE  BUILT UP PRESSURE IN THE GAS TANK. HEAT ON MY FOOT WAS SO BAD THAT  I'VE GONE THROUGH MANY PAIRS OF BOOTS AND WORE FIRE/HEAT RESISTANT  SOCKS TO MITIGATE DISCOMFORT. I HAD THE ECM SOFTWARE  UPDATE/FUSE BOX SEALING WARRANTY CAMPAIGN [2013-9] DONE ON MY BIKE AT  THE MALCOLM SMITH MOTORSPORTS DEALERSHIP. I CONTINUED TO HAVE HEAT  ISSUES. AFTER IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WASN'T A SOLUTION TO MY  HEAT PROBLEM, I HAD THE EXHAUST WRAPPED AND INSULATION INSTALLED. THIS HAD  LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON REDUCING HEAT.   ON SATURDAY (JULY 26, 2014) I LEFT MY HOME AT 5:50 PM TO RIDE.  THE TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 95 DEGREES. ONCE AGAIN, I NOTICED HEAT WHILE  RIDING.

AS I BEGAN TO SLOW, I ALSO NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE  AREA JUST AHEAD OF THE SEAT. THINKING IT WAS EITHER AN ELECTRICAL  PROBLEM OR MELTING BODYWORK, I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, STOPPED  AND HIT THE KILL ENGINE SWITCH. AFTER GETTING OFF THE BIKE, I OPENED  THE SEAT. INSTANTLY THERE WAS A ?WHOOSHING? SOUND AND THE BIKE WAS  ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
