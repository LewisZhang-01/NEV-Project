        "summary": "RE:F270RKS  ON 12/12/2003), WE BOUGHT A AMERI-CAMP F270RKS. IT WAS LISTED AS A HIGH PROFILE RIG AT THAT TIME AND WE PURCHASED IT FROM WILDER RV IN CLINTON, MO. WE PAID $29,549.00 CASH!  UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE AND IS LITERALLY FALLING APART AND IS DEFINITELY INADEQUATE. THE FIRST YEAR WE OWNED IT, THERE WERE 26 MAJOR PROBLEMS AND AMERI-CAMP CAME AND GOT IT FROM MISSOURI AND TOOK IT TO SYRACUSE. WE WERE WITHOUT OUR RIG FOR 6 MONTHS THE VERY FIRST YEAR! THE 2ND YEAR AND ONLY THE 1ST ROAD TRIP SINCE YOU DELIVERED IT BACK TO MISSOURI,THE OVEN DIDN'T WORK AND WE HAD FURNACE PROBLEMS. SANDI TOOK CARE OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS AFTER WE PAID FOR THE REPAIRS. THE 2ND ROAD TRIP FOR THIS RIG HAS PROVED TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER. PLEASE SEE THE ENCLOSED LETTER I POSTED ON THE GOOD SAM WEB SITE TODAY, AFTER NOT RECEIVING A REPLY TO MY PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS.  WE ARE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY, THE SERVICE WAS NOT PERFORMED CORRECTLY, THE ACTUAL CAGE IS DEFECTIVE AS IS THE ENTIRE INTERIOR. WE WERE DECEIVED AND AMERI-CAMP MISREPRESENTED THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. WE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION OF QUALITY.  TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, WE WOULD APPRECIATE A BUY BACK FROM AMERI-CAMP. THIS IS THE ONLY LOGICAL ANSWER AND WE KNOW  IT CAN BE DONE. IT'S A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT BE ON WILDERS OR US. ENCLOSED ARE COPIES OF OUR RECORDS.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY AND A RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, AND WILL WAIT 5 DAYS FROM MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2006 FOR YOU TO CONTACT JOE AT WILDER'S RV WITH YOUR ANSWER BEFORE WE SEEK A RESOLUTION FROM THE MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND THE INDIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL.    SINCERELY,  ENCLOSURE(S)   SALES RECEIPT   COMPLAINT DOCUMENTS   REPAIR DOCUMENTS   DELIVERY RECEIPT.  *JB",
