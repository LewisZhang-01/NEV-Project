This resulted in the belly pan bolt being ripped from the structure of the vehicle. The belly pan then folded under the car and was dragged. I had this fixed under warranty. During the next heavy rain, I again hit a puddle, the bolt was ripped from the structure again. Luckily both times I was able to slow to a stop. However I believe this presents a serious hazard at freeway speeds of +65mph, where the entire belly pan can disintegrate and fly off into traffic. This is a defect in design and does not hold up to normal wear. It presents a very significant problem. When looking at car forums, it appears this problem is wide spread and presents a very real risk of hurting someone.",
