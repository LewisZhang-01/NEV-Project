HOWEVER, THE WHITE INFINITY AHEADHAD HIT THE BRAKES CAUSING ME TOTAP HER REAR BUMPER AT AN IMPACT UNDER 5 MPH. THEN THE THREE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911 AND THEY TRANSFERRED ME TO THE CHP. AFTER HANGING UP, I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND THE OTHER DRIVER AND IEXCHANGED INFORMATION. THE OTHER DRIVER LEFT WITHIN 5 MINUTES AS HERBUMPER WAS LEFT WITH ONLY A MINOR SCRATCH, AND NO DENTS OR BUMPS.I GOT BACK IN MY VEHICLE AND WAITED FOR THE CHP. WHEN THE OFFICER ARRIVED, HE PUSHED MY CAR TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE WAITED FOR THE AAA TOW TRUCK. NO ACCIDENT REPORT WAS TAKEN AS THERE WAS NO ACCUSATIONS OR INJURY.

THERE WAS NO ABILITY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT COMPLETELY STOPPING, PUTTING THE CAR IN PARK, AND RESTARTING THE CAR.  AS A RESULT OF BEING IN ACCESSORY MODE, I HAD NO POWER STEERING AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO GLIDE OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  A MESSAGE APPEARED ON THE CAR'S SCREEN: \"TRANSMISSION NOT IN PARK, VEHICLE MAY ROLL.\"  I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE 3 MONTHS AGO.  I AM VERY CONCERNED, AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR.  IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN ON A HIGHWAY, THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, AS I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE SHOULDER.  AS EVIDENCED IN THE GM IGNITION SWITCH CASES, WHEN A CAR IS SWITCHED INTO ACCESSORY MODE WHILE DRIVING, THE AIRBAGS ARE DEACTIVATED AS WELL.  SHOULD THIS HAPPEN ON A BUSY ROADWAY/HIGHWAY, AND THERE IS AN ACCIDENT, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT IT COULD BE FATAL.     *TR",
