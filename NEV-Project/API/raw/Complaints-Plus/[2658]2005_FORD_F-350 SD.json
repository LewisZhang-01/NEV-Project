THESE WHEELS ARE USED PRIMARILY BY PEOPLE THAT CARRY HEAVY LOADS AS THE 19.5 TIRES AFFORD BETTER STABILITY. SHOULD SOMEONE NOT BE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF LOOSING A TIRE.

THIS WAS ABOUT APRIL 25 2009. ON MAY 14 2009 I WENT TO FORD FOR MY OIL CHANGE. THEY DISCOVERED THE FRONT PASSENGERS UNIVERSAL JOINT IS BROKEN. I WAS NOT IN FOUR WHEEL DRIVE WHEN THIS LOUD POP OCCURRED. BUT I DID ALMOST LOSE CONTROL PRIOR TO HEARING IT POP, MY SPEED AT THE TIME OF POP WAS ABOUT 35MPH. I KEEP THE TIRE PRESSURE UP, BY CHECKING IT ALMOST EVERY TIME I ADD FUEL. AND THE TIRES ARE CHECKED AT EACH OIL CHANGE, EVERY 3,000 MILES. THE LETTER I RECEIVED FROM FORD, SAYS TO CHECK TIRE PRESSURE. THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS GOOD WHEN I CHECKED IT SHORTLY AFTER HEARING THE UNIVERSAL JOINT POP. THE SIZE OF TIRE IS THE SAME AS THE ONES INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY. I DO NOT HAVE ANY SUSPENSION MODIFICATIONS. AFTER THE FORD DEALER TOLD ME I NEED A NEW UNIVERSAL JOINT, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER ALIGNMENT SHOP. HE HAD A F250 HE WAS WORKING ON THAT HAD ABOUT THE SAME THING HAPPEN. AND TOLD ME THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING ALOT. AFTER WHICH I CALLED FORD, THEY WILL NOT WARRANTY THE ISSUE, ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDED TO ME THAT THE OPERATORS WERE WELL AWARE THESE TRUCKS SHIMMY AND THEN POP THERE UNIVERSAL JOINTS. I AM FEARFUL TO DRIVE THE TRUCK, AS I THINK NEXT TIME I MAY LOSE ALL CONTROL. FORD WILL NOT WARRANTY THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED, BUT THE OPERATORS TOLD ME I SHOULD SELL IT, AS THEY HAVE LOTS OF COMPLAINTS LIKE THIS.

VEHICLE HAD APPROX. 14,800 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  DID NOT LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT, I FEEL THAT IT COULD IN ANOTHER CASE. THERE WERE NO WARNINGS THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND OCCURRED SUDDENLY WITHOUT WARNING.  I WAS DRIVING INTO TOWN(ABOUT 17 MILES). ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 75 MPH. MY VEHICLE LOST MOST OF IT'S POWER AND BEGAN TO JERK AND SPUTTER AS I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SHUT VEHICLE OFF, DID A BASIC CHECK OF THE VEHICLES COMPONENTS AND THEN RESTARTED . STARTED AND RAN FINE. I BEGAN TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC ONLY TO LOOSE SIGNIFICANT POWER AND WAS FORCED  TO RETURN TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I WAS SERIOUSLY SLOWING THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I  BEGAN TO LIMP MY TRUCK TO THE NEAREST EXIT RAMP. EXITED THE INTERSTATE, MY TRUCK DIED AND LEFT ME STRANDED, NOT ABLE TO RESTART. VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. AT THE REPAIR SHOP, THE #1 CYLINDER INJECTOR WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED AND WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW OR REBUILT PART. (THIS IS NOT SPECIFIED BY FORD.) I DID/DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FAILED PART(S). APPROX. 3 WEEKS AFTER THIS INCIDENT, MY TRUCK EXPERIENCED THE SAME FAILURE (AN INJECTOR ON CYLINDER #7) WITH SIMILAR RESULTS. FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND CONSIDERS IT AN \"ACCEPTABLE\" DESIGN FLAW AND PUTS THE BLAME ON POOR FUEL (ALL OTHER DIESEL ENGINES WILL RUN ON FUEL STATION GRADE FUEL, WHICH IS ONLY TO BE EXPECTED.). I KNOW THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM IN THE 2003 TO THE 2006 POWERSTROKE 6.0L ENGINES. IT IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM. IN THE CASE OF TWO INJECTORS FAILING AT ONCE, THE VEHICLE WOULD BE INOPERABLE WITH FAILED BRAKING, STEERING AND POWER LOSS. IF ONE INJECTOR FAILS, THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE ERRATIC POWER SURGES AND PARTIAL OR FULL LOSS OF POWER WITH FAILED OR REDUCED BRAKING AND STEERING.  AT HIGHWAY SPEED, AND WITH NO WARNING THIS COULD SPELL DISASTER.   *JB",
