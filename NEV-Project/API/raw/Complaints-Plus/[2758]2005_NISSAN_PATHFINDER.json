They said my radiator was bad and had leaked radiator fluid . They thought could replace radiator and flush the system . I started looking at issues online . I found so many people with the same problems . I also found that Nissan was aware of a faulty crack in radiator. Which is the exact problem I had . I already spent 1000 $ in repairs with radiator and flushing system . I Am now out that money and the transmission has been effected by this issue . Tried everything possible with flushing system . Unfortunately this crack was the problem that has now left me with a perfect car that needs a transmission. So disappointed that Nissan ignores all the issues that unfortunately happened after 100,000 miles . Especially when they claim to know the radiator crack is a faulty part . That crack destroyed a perfect vehicle . Nissan should be accountable of these issues especially when their faulty part not only needed a new radiator but leaked into transmission .  I am still sitting with this car . Unsafe to drive and  unsafe to sell .",

Several times I came close to being rear-ended. This problem also occurs when starting after a red light, when accelerating on a highway (usually 3rd or 4th gear), and when turning left on a green arrow. Not only has it caused many close calls with being rear-ended, but it has also incited road rage in people who are driving behind me.  Now I'm told I need a new transmission and also a new coolant system which leaks due to a fault in the system known by Nissan, and pollutes the transmission.  This is a terrible safety threat and Nissan should own up to it and pay for the repairs.",

ACCORDING TO HIS PAST CLIENTS NISSAN FAILED TO DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM REGARDLESS OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD. I VISITED THE DEALER IN WHICH I HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND EXPLAIN THE SERVICE MAN MY CONCERN. HE CLEARLY TOLD ME THAT MY WARRANTY WAS OVER AND THAT THE LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN TO BE REIMBURSED HAD ENDED IN 2013. I TOLD HIM THAT MY VEHICLE FREQUENTLY COMES TO THEIR SERVICE CENTER FOR MAINTENANCE AND IF THEY WERE AWARE OF THE FAILURE IN THESES VEHICLES ONCE THEY REACH THEIR 100,000 MILES WHY DID THEY FAIL TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT OCCURRED. IT SURPRISES ME THAT NISSAN FAILED TO INFORM ANY OF ITS CONSUMERS OF THE PROBLEM WHEN IT WAS GOING THROUGH A LAWSUIT. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE COULD NOT HELP ME AND REFERRED ME TO CORPORATE OFFICE. I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CALLED WITHIN TWO DAYS. I RECEIVED THE CALL BACK FROM NISSAN SIMPLY TELLING ME MY CASE WAS REVIEWED AND THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY WARRANTY IS OVER.

APPARENTLY AS A RESULT OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT, NISSAN HAD AGREED TO THE WARRANTY EXTENSION.    WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE, TO SAY THAT IN LIEU OF RECALLING THE DEFECTIVE RADIATOR, AND MAKING A $500 REPAIR, THEY DECIDED TO ROLL THE DICE WITH THEIR REPUTATION AND THEIR CUSTOMER'S WALLET ON A POTENTIAL $3,500 TO $4,000 REPAIR.    WHAT A MORON BUSINESS DECISION.    THE SECOND JOKE CAME, WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT THE WARRANTY ON THE REPAIR, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS ONLY 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES.

I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SHOP FOR THE SAME THING ABOUT TWO MORE TIMES, AND I GOT THE SAME ANSWER. THE CAR ONLY GOT WORSE AND WORSE. AT THE LAST VISIT, WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS ALMOST BROKEN, THEY TOLD ME ABOUT A COOLER SYSTEM CRACK AND THEY RECOMMENDED I REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION WITH A NEW ONE. I TOLD THEM I HAD NO MONEY FOR IT, SO WHAT THEY DID WAS FIX THE CRACK, FLUSH THE TRANSMISSION, AND CLEAN IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INSIDE. AFTER A WHILE, MY TRANSMISSION BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY AND AFTER MY CAR WAS OVER 100,000 MILES, THAT'S WHEN I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE DEALER TELLING ME ABOUT A FACTORY FAILURE -- I DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY ONLY FIXED CARS WITH LESS THAN 100,000 MILES ON THEM. THIS ISN'T FAIR BECAUSE I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE LONG BEFORE THE CAR HAD 100,000 MILES ON IT. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THIS ISSUE. I WOULD APPRECIATE THE HELP.

DO PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE HORRIFIC ACCIDENTS BEFORE THEY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT ? I PAID GOOD MONEY, HARD EARNED MONEY FOR THIS VEHICLE, BRAND NEW. THE COSTS TO REPAIR ARE RIDICULOUS. MY HUSBAND HAS A CAR OLDER THAN ME, MORE WEAR AND TEAR AND HAS NEVER HAD AN ISSUE.    THE CATALYTIC ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE IT KILLS THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT A USELESS BOX. TO ME, NISSAN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS OR THEIR SAFETY. THE RELAY AND TRANSMISSION ISSUES ALMOST CAUSED US HUGE ACCIDENTS. WITHOUT QUICK THINKING AND QUICK REFLEXES WE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT.    SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE !!!    THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.  *TR",

HE TOOK IT BACK TO NISSAN & INSISTED THE DO THE RECALLED PART & THE BAD ECM. SERVICE WAS UPSET THAT HE WENT IN THERE TELLING THEM THE PROBLEM. THEY FREE OF CHARGE GOT MY CAR GOING AGAIN. SUPPOSEDLY MY KEY HAD \"RESET\" ITSELF. WHICH \"COULD BE CAUSED BY A BATTERY BEING DEAD FOR TOO LONG OR BEING JUMP STARTED\". OUR BATTERY WAS NEW & ONLY MAYBE 6 MONTHS OLD. NISSAN SERVICE MANAGER CLAIMED SHE CHECKED THE GROUND & IT WAS ALL OK. JUST THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS NEEDED REPLACEMENT FOR ABOUT $2000 BUT WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF STALLING OR THE KEY RESETTING ITSELF. SHE INSISTED THE ECM WAS GOOD & THE RECALLED PART HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. A WEEK LATER & HERE I AM AGAIN WITH A CAR THAT WONT START. THIS TIME THE NISSAN TECH CAME TO THE STORE WHERE I WAS STRANDED AT. HIS MACHINE COULDN'T EVEN READ THE CODES & HE SAID MAYBE IT WAS GROUND WIRES IN MY DASH OR THE ECM BUT HARD TO SAY UNLESS I PAID TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AGAIN! OF COURSE I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT. I WOULDN'T MIND AS MOST FOR MINOR REPAIRS/MAITENANCE BUT IT SEEMS THIS YEAR/MODEL IS PURE CRAP. AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS I REALIZE THAT MY CAR SHAKING AT 60+ MILES WHEN I DO HIT THE FREEWAY IS A HUGE PROBLEM AS WELL! WE LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN WHERE WE DON'T USUALLY DRIVE THOSE HIGH SPEEDS SO I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT MUCH OF IT UNTIL NOW. NISSAN KNOWS VERY WELL THESE ARE HUGE PROBLEM CARS YET DOESN'T CARE! THESE VEHICLES ARE NOT SAFE. THE STALLING HAS HAPPENED AT INTERSECTIONS OR DRIVING!!",

I NEVER RECEIVED AND PAPERWORK SUCH AS ANY RECALLS CAMPAIGNS. ABOUT THE END OF MAY OR FIRST WEEK OF JUNE OF 2013 MY CAR STARTED TO DO A VIBRATION AND THEN ACTED LIKE IT WANTED TO STALL AND HIT REAL HARD INTO GEAR. IT WASN'T TILL JUNE 14, 2013 THAT IT PUT ME ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD RUNNING HOT TO WHERE I PULLED OVER IN 80+ DEGREE WEATHER WITH MY 2 YEAR OLD SON AND MY 3 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER IN THE CAR. I STARTED TO SEARCH THE INTERNET TO FIND A FEW RECALLS AND MANY UNHAPPY NISSAN CUSTOMERS AND FIND THAT NISSAN HAS MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE RADIATOR FLUID LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING A MILKY SUBSTANCES. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ANY RECALL AND FIND OUT THAT MANY ARE VERY UPSET WITH NISSAN WHO ISN'T FIXING THIS ISSUE AFTER THEIR VEHICLES HIT 80K. I  AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS ISSUES AND FEEL THAT NISSAN SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. PLEASE CONTACT ME ON MY ISSUES. AS I WILL BE GOING HIGHER UP AND TO THE MEDIA LIKE THE REST OF YOUR UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS! THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOKING AT MY LETTER.  *TR",

UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS OUT OF TOWN FOR WORK THAT WEEK SO SHE CALLED OUR NEIGHBOR AND HE HELPED GET THE TRUCK BACK TO OUR HOUSE.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE SITUATION WITH ME ON THE PHONE, SHE CALLED SEVERAL TRANSMISSION SPECIALISTS AND HAD ONE OF THEM (A+ TRANSMISSION) PICK UP THE SUV THE NEXT DAY.  AFTER A RUNNING A DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND DETERMINING THE SEVERITY OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, THEY HAD TO PULL THE TRANSMISSION TO DO A COMPLETE INSPECTION.  THEY DETERMINED THAT THE RADIATOR HAD LEAKED INTO THE TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFER CASE AND THAT THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION INCLUDING THE RADIATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  WE OPTED FOR A REBUILD SINCE TRANSMISSIONS FROM NISSAN WERE ON 6 MONTH BACKORDER DUE TO OTHER NISSAN'S HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.  WE SPENT ALMOST $4,000 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WITH NO HELP FROM NISSAN.  AFTER SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, WE FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THE LACK OF A RECALL BY NISSAN.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT NISSAN HAS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS.  I HOPE THAT SOMEONE WILL MAKE NISSAN DO THE RIGHT THING.  *TR",

MY FAMILY WAS IN THE VEHICLE AND WE WERE LEAVING A PLACE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WAS KIND OF ON A HILL AND WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE, BUT STARTED TO GO BACKWARD. I CUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND TRIED AGAIN AND WE WERE OFF AND GOING, UNTIL WE WERE ON THE ROAD AND IN TRAFFIC GOING ABOUT 45MPH THE VEHICLE STARTED TO STALL, AND WE HAD TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF TRAFFIC. I GT THE VEHICLE GOING AGAIN AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO FINE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS, THEN ON SEPT 15 I WOKE EARLY TO TAKE A FAMILY MEMBER TO A WEEKEND CLASS, AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN MY STREET I HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE 2005 PATHFINDER I ROLLED MY WINDOW DOWN TO HEAR THE SOUND AS I WAS LISTENING THE SOUND WENT AWAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS APPROACHING THE TRAFFIC LIGHT THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO STALL, I WAS PUSHING ON THE GAS AND IT WOULD NOT GO, THE LIGHT WAS GREEN AND I HAD CARS BEHIND ME. I HAD TO TURN MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND TRY TO GET MYSELF OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD TO SAFETY, ONCE I DID I HAD TO PARK MY VEHICLE IN A BUSINESS PARKING LOT AT A SHOPPING CENTER THAT IS CLOSE TO MY HOME. AT THIS POINT MY VEHICLE IS PARKED DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WILL NOT ACCELERATE WHEN PUT IN DRIVE. I HAVE TALKED TO NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE ADVISED THAT THEY HAVE HEARD OF THE RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION FLUID MIX AND THIS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE WITH MY 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER, AND THAT IT IS COSTLY TO GET IT REPAIRED. THE COST IS ULTIMATELY LEFT UP TO ME, AND I FEEL AS IF THIS IS A NISSAN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR QUITE SOME TIME FOR SOME OTHER NISSAN CUSTOMERS THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED A RECALL AND NISSAN SHOULD BE FIXING THIS MANUFACTURING PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE CAR BEHIND ME ALMOST HIT ME, I COULD BARELY GET THE CAR TO STEER AND HAD TROUBLE GETTING ENOUGH JUICE TO PULL IT OVER SAFELY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, I SEE THAT NISSAN RADIATORS ARE DEFECTIVE; THEY RUPTURE AND ALLOW THE COOLANT TO SPILL OVER INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM IN TRANSMISSION, CONTAMINATING BOTH AND RUINING BOTH RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION.  THERE ARE COUNTLESS STORIES OF PEOPLE STALLING IN TRAFFIC OR COMPLETELY LOSING ENOUGH ACCELERATION POWER IN A VERY ABRUPT MANNER THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET VERY HURT, IF NOT DIE.  WHAT IF MY KIDS HAD BEEN IN THE CAR WITH ME?  WHAT IF WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HEAVIER TRAFFIC IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES? THE THOUGHT OF THIS MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH.  I WAS VERY LUCKY NOT TO HAVE BEEN HURT OR HURT SOMEONE ELSE AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.  NISSAN AND YOU ALL NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A REAL SAFETY RISK EXISTS HERE.  A RECALL MUST BE DONE!  SICKENS ME TO THINK OF THOSE WHO WILL EVENTUALLY LOSE THEIR LIVES.  HOW CAN GOING FROM A FULL FUNCTIONING SPEED TO NO SPEED AT ALL IN THE MOST ABRUPT, NERVE-JARRING MANNER POSSIBLE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MANEUVER YOUR VEHICLE NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE?  PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.  OH, AND AS IF IT ISN'T ENOUGH THAT NISSAN OBVIOUSLY HAS NO REGARD FOR THEIR CONSUMER'S SAFETY, THEY ARE LIMITING THE WARRANTIES IN SUCH AN UNREALISTIC MANNER THAT THE CONSUMER IS FORCED TO FOOT $6,000-$8,000 TO FIX THE ISSUE THAT THEY CLEARLY KNEW ABOUT AND COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM THE GET-GO. *TR",

THE NISSAN ADVISOR AND I NOTICED TRANSMISSION FLUID IN MULTIPLE PLACES. COOLANT CONTAINER WAS MUDDY WITH TRANSMISSION FLUID. VEHICLE HAD JUST ENOUGH MILES BELOW THE 80,000 MILES. HOPEFULLY THE NISSAN COMPANY WILL COVER THE REPAIRS. TECHNICIAN SAID THE 80,000 MILES WARRANTY WILL BE GOOD UNTIL SOMETIME IN THE YEAR 2013.     I WAS IN THE FREEWAY DRIVING AND THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO SLIP. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE I COULD OF BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT IF I WAS MAKING A LEFT TURN IN THE HIGHWAY AND THE OPPOSITE DRIVER COULD OF HIT THE TRUCK IN THE PASSENGER SIDE. THE NISSAN ADVISOR TOLD ME THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING TO MANY VEHICLES FROM THE YEARS OF 2005 TO 2007. JUST TODAY HE REGISTERED 5 VEHICLES FOR REPAIRS. THE MAJORITY HAD 83,000 TO 91,000, SO THE WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THESE TYPE OF VEHICLES. TRANSMISSION REPAIR FOR A 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER RUNS FROM $4,000 TO $6,000 PLUS OTHER PARTS. NISSAN SHOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO AT LEAST 100,000 MILES AND REPAIR THE RADIATOR PROBLEM. THE NISSAN ADVISOR INFORMED ME THAT THE RADIATOR GETS DAMAGED AND ANTIFREEZE MIXES INSIDE TRANSMISSION,\"THIS DAMAGES THE TRANSMISSION AND MANY OTHER PARTS DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE LEAKING AND SPLASHING OF THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.\"  *TR",

AS THE NISSAN WAS PARKED IN OUR GARAGE, WE NOTICED FLUID LEAKING ONTO THE GROUND. THE FLUID HAD A MILKY WHITE SUBSTANCE IN IT.

WE HAD THE PATHFINDER DIAGNOSED ON JUNE 3, 2011 BY BILLINGS NISSAN. WE HAD INFORMED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT NISSAN THAT WE WERE SUSPECTING THE TRANSMISSION WAS CONTAMINATED WITH COOLANT. NISSAN INFORMED US THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THEY ARE SEPARATE UNITS AND THAT THE MILKY WHITE SUBSTANCE IN THE TRANSMISSION WAS A RESULT OF AIR ENTERING THE TRANSMISSION.

ACCELERATING ON TO THE FREEWAY WAS NEVER AN ISSUE, BUT IT WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY SHIFT INTO THE APPROPRIATE GEAR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.

TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IN MAY AND THEY COULD DUPLICATE, BUT NOT CONSISTENTLY AND SAW NO MIXING OF COOLANT AND TRANSMISSION FLUID. TOWED IT IN TO THE DEALER IN AUGUST, THE DAMAGE IS DONE, THE FLUIDS HAVE MIXED AND THE TRANSMISSION COMPUTER HAS SHORTED OUT. REPAIR RECOMMENDED IS TO REPLACE TRANSMISSION (INCLUDING COMPUTER) AND RADIATOR AND HOSES. CUSTOMER CANNOT AFFORD THE $6,000 PRICE TAG ON THE REPAIR.

HE INFORMED US THAT THERE WAS WATER/COOLANT FROM THE RADIATOR THAT LEAKED INTO THE TRANSMISSION, HE ADVICE US TO TAKE IT IN TO OUR LOCAL NISSAN DEALER SHOP. WE HAD TO PAY NISSAN $96 FOR THEM TO PERFORM A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT OUR MECHANICS RESULTS. ONCE THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED IT CONFIRMED WHAT OUT MECHANIC HAD INFORMED US. WE SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO NISSAN OF AMERICA, AND SADLY THEY DENIED OUR CLAIM. THEIR REASON BEHIND THE DENIAL WAS BECAUSE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE RADIATOR COVERED UP TO 80K MILES OUR TRUCK WAS OVER ABOUT 35K MILES. WE ARE STUCK WITH A BILL OF OVER 6K TO HAVE THE TRUCK FIXED, IT REQUIRES A NEW TRANSMISSION, RADIATOR, TRANNY COOLER LINE FLUSH AND COOLANT FLUSH.

I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO RAY BRANDT.THIS TIME THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE ISSUES WERE RELATED TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. APPARENTLY IT HAD COME APART AND DAMAGED THE ENGINE.

I TOOK IT IN WITH 93,855 MILES IN AUGUST 2010 FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY REPAIR. THIS REPAIR WAS DECLINED FOR COVERAGE (NOT A NISSAN WARRANTY) AND I PAID $408.65 TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AT THE NISSAN DEALER.  IN DECEMBER 2010, I RECEIVED FROM NISSAN A LETTER RELATING THIS EXACT PROBLEM/FAILURE AND THAT ALL 2005 THRU 2008 PATHFINDERS WERE BEING ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION OF UP TO 6 YEARS AND 72,000 MILES. FROM DOING RESEARCH, I UNDERSTAND NISSAN ORIGINALLY DID THIS FOR JUST 2006 THRU 2008 VEHICLES, BUT THERE WAS SUCH AN OUTCRY FROM OWNERS OF 2005S THAT THEY WERE LATER INCLUDED. IN THE NISSAN LETTER, IT STATED THAT IF YOU HAD THIS FAULT AND HAD IT REPAIRED AT YOUR EXPENSE, YOU COULD SEND IN DOCUMENTATION FOR A REFUND. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE 6 YEAR OR 72,000 MILE LIMITATION IN THE LETTER FOR PRIOR REPAIRS. I SENT IN MY DOCUMENTATION. IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT A FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT COVER ALL REPAIRS, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THOSE WHO BOUGHT THE EARLY VEHICLES WITH OBVIOUSLY MORE MILES THAN THE NEWER ONES ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SINCE MY REFUND WAS DENIED. I HAVE READ ON YOUR SITE THAT MANY OTHERS WITH 2005S ARE ALSO BEING DENIED. NISSAN SHOULD DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS. IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE ONE CAN RUN OUT OF GAS AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME, OR EVEN PUMP IN GAS AND HAVE IT OVERFLOW DUE TO THE TANK BEING FULL AND THE DRIVER NOT KNOWING IT. THEY COULD TRY TO FORCE IN FUEL DUE TO A 1/4 TANK INDICATION, AND WHILE REFUELING, AFTER PUTTING IN 3 GALLONS, THE AUTOMATIC PUMP CUTS OFF THE FLOW. THE DRIVER KNOWS THAT 3 GALLONS DID NOT FILL A 1/4 FULL TANK SO THEY KEEP PULLING THE HANDLE TRYING TO FILL THE TANK.

I TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND NISSAN, AND WAS TOLD THIS ONLY AFFECTED MY VEHICLE. HOWEVER, A RECALL WAS JUST ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM.     THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED TO US, I WAS DRIVING BACK HOME WITH MY FAMILY FROM A CAMPING TRIP IN BIG BEAR, CALIFORNIA. OUR VEHICLE WAS FULLY LOADED DOWN WITH PASSENGERS AND CAMPING GEAR ON A LARGE DOWNHILL GRADE WHEN IT STALLED. SINCE THE POWER BRAKES WENT OUT, IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THE VEHICLE TO STOP BY HOLDING THE BRAKES AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND FINALLY COMING TO A PORTION OF THE ROAD THAT WAS NO LONGER DOWNHILL. IF THIS HAPPENS IN THE WRONG PLACE, THIS FAILURE COULD CAUSE A CRASH, SERIOUS INJURY, OR DEATH.    ALSO, WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING, THE VEHICLE CANNOT BE RESTARTED WHILE ROLLING BY PLACING THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND TURNING THE KEY FOR THE STARTER. THE KEY MUST BE FULLY TURNED TO THE OFF POSITION FOR A FEW SECONDS,AND THEN BACK ON. ONCE THE KEY IS OFF, THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS, SO YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO RESTART IT WHEN ROLLING.

THIS WAS ON AUGUST 12, 2010.  WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF OVER $4500.00.  WE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW COOLANT COULD BE LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION, SO WE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED NISSAN NORTH AMERICA AND FILED A COMPLAINT.  THIS KIND OF DAMAGE SHOULD NOT OCCUR DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  WE WERE INFORMED THAT NOT ENOUGH COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN FILED BUT THEY WOULD KEEP A RECORD OF OUR CALL AND WE WOULD BE CONTACTED IF THEY EVER DID A RECALL IN THE FUTURE.  STILL CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WAS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM, WE DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION AT ANOTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIP, LESS THAN 15 MILES AWAY FROM THE FIRST.  THIS WAS DONE ON AUGUST 30, 2010.  WE WERE TOLD THE SAME THING, THE COOLANT WAS LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION, BUT THEY WANTED OVER FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE SAME REPAIR.  BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION, WE DECIDED TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE FURTHER.  WE WERE AMAZED TO FIND OVER A HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ONLINE, ALL FROM OWNERS OF 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDERS, AND ALL COMPLAINING ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THEY HAD TO PAY TO REPAIR BOTH RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WE, TOO, WERE EXPERIENCING.  WITH NO HELP OR ACKNOWLEDGE FROM NISSAN, WE WENT TO AN OUTSIDE MECHANIC AND HAD THE WORK DONE AT A MUCH LOWER COST. *TR",

COME TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS TRANSMISSION FLUID. SO MUCH OF IT THAT IT HAD EVEN CLOGGED UP THE PASSAGE WAY TO THE THERMOSTAT. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I HAD FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT SAME ORDEAL. THERE IS A FLAW IN THE RADIATORS THAT WERE USED BY NISSAN ON 2005 AND UP PATHFINDERS, X-TERRAS, AND FRONTIERS WITH THE 4.0 V6 ENGINES. THESE RADIATORS, IN WHICH ANTI-FREEZE AND AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID, WOULD BOTH PASS THROUGH ARE SOMEHOW CRACKING AND MIXING THE 2 FLUIDS TOGETHER. WHEN THIS MIXTURE OCCURS, THE RADIATOR AND TRANNY OIL WOULD NEED TO BE FLUSHED. THE TRANSMISSION WILL THEN ALSO NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF DAMAGE ALREADY DONE. THIS WILL AD UP TO ABOUT 5K-8K. NISSAN DOES NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS DAMAGE. IF YOU GOOGLE \"2005+ NISSAN PATHFINDER TRANSMISSION\", YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINS ABOUT IT. *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CAR TO THE DEALER, AVOIDING THE HIGHWAY FOR FEAR OF GETTING HIT BY SOMEONE WHILE MY CAR HAD VERY LITTLE RESPONSIVENESS.

THE DEALER QUOTED ME $7000 TO FIX THIS ISSUE.  AFTER CALLING AROUND AND FINDING AN AAMCO DEALER WHO EXPLAINED TO ME THIS WELL KNOWN ISSUE, I WAS QUOTED A PRICE OF \"ONLY\" $3800 TO FIX IT.      THE PROBLEM, AS DESCRIBED BY THE MECHANIC, WAS A FAULTY DESIGN WHERE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID TRAVELS THROUGH THE RADIATOR WITH SOME SORT OF VALVE BOX BETWEEN THEM AND THE HEAT DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE COOLANT AND TRANSMISSION FLUID NECESSARILY CAUSES THE VALVE BOX TO DECAY CAUSING THE 2 FLUIDS TO MIX.  THE RESULT IS A COMPLETELY RUINED RADIATOR, COMPLETELY RUINED VALVE BOX, AND IF NOT TREATED EARLY, A COMPLETELY RUINED TRANSMISSION.

I BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO NISSAN WITH 70,000 MILES, AT WHICH TIME I WAS TOLD THAT THE RADIATOR LEAKED INTO THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING THE NEED FOR BOTH TO BE REPLACED AT THE COST OF $6700.00. I DID ALOT OF RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER WITH APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MILEAGE (JUST AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRES) ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH A FAULTY RADIATOR SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED INTO THESE VEHICLES. THEY KEPT MY TRUCK FOR 12 DAYS WHILE TRYING TO DECIDE IF THEY WOULD OFFER ASSISTANCE WITH FIXING MY 5 YEAR OLD VEHICLE. THE END RESULT BEING, THAT THEY WOULD PAY TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AND I WOULD PAY TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR AS WELL AS THE LABOR COSTS. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS DID NOT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF ANYTHING I DID WRONG. I ASKED WHY A RECALL ISN'T BEING DONE, AT WHICH TIME I WAS TOLD THAT THE NUMBER OF INJURIES OR DEATHS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THAT DETERMINATION. ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT INJURED, THIS IS A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN TO TAKE ON FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD.

AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE (HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F177B6C/8#MSG8) I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE A TON OF PEOPLE HAVING THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM ON THE '05 NISSAN PATHFINDERS.  APPARENTLY, THERE IS A HOSE THAT RUNS FROM THE RADIATOR TO THE TRANSMISSION AND THERE IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM WITH ANTIFREEZE LEAKING FROM THE RADIATOR INTO THE TRANSMISSION, THUS CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION AND THEN ULTIMATELY SHUT DOWN.  AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE POST ON EDMUNDS.COM, THIS IS A CHRONIC ISSUE IMPACTING ALL 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER OWNERS.  I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO GET THE RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION REPLACED ON THIS VEHICLE.  YET, I MUST HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO/FRO WORK.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE ENGINEERING ON NISSANS PART AND THEY NEED TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS ISSUE AND ADDRESS THE FAULTY ENGINEERING HERE BEFORE SOMEONE'S TRANSMISSION SHUTS DOWN AT 60MPH CAUSING A CRASH ON ONE OF OUR HIGHWAYS/INTERSTATES. *TR",

THE ISSUE IS THE FAILURE OF TIMING CHAIN MECHANISMS DUE TO INFERIOR QUALITY PLASTIC GUIDES THAT HAVE FAILED ON A HUGE SCALE WORLDWIDE.  NISSAN'S RECOGNITION OF THIS PROBLEM WAS REFLECTED IN TSB NOS. NTB07-042 AND NTB07-042A.  RECOGNIZING THE DESIGN FLAW, NISSAN CHANGED THE PARTS IN 2008 AND FORWARD.  OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY TIMES, NISSAN REFUSES TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE RELEVANT PARTS AND, APPARENTLY, HAS NOT NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE THAT COULD RESULT IN ACCIDENTS INVOLVING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF SUDDEN ENGINE FAILURE.  AS DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET, MANY FAILURES OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE OCCURRING POST-WARRANTY AND MOST CONSUMERS HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPENDING DANGERS BECAUSE NISSAN APPEARS TO HAVE NOT PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM.  FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO DO BECOME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM POST-WARRANTY, THEY ARE FACING REPAIR COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2500.00 WHICH IS AN ECONOMIC BURDEN PLACED UPON THEM BY NISSAN EMANATING FROM NISSAN'S OWN INTERNALLY-RECOGNIZED DESIGN FLAW.  REQUEST IS HEREBY MADE THAT THIS SITUATION BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT NISSAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SAFETY DANGERS IT HAS PERPETRATED BY ITS ADMITTED DESIGN FLAWS.  OUR OWN 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER IS FACING THIS PROBLEM AT THE PRESENT TIME.  AT A MINIMUM, NISSAN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADVISE ALL OWNERS OF THE RELEVANT VEHICLES ABOUT THE NEED TO AVOID ENGINE FAILURE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE LARGE NUMBER OF AFFECTED PARTIES WHO ARE POST-WARRANTY AND UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE NHTSA SHOULD ALSO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF PARTS FAILURES PRE- AND POST-WARRANTY. *TR",

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT NISSAN PLANS TO DO TO CORRECT THIS.  *JB",
