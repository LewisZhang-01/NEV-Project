INSIDE, THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE (GRAPEFRUIT SIZE) IN FRONT OF THE STEERING COLUMN. I RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT SOME WATER AND DOUSED THE FLAMES. I WAS VERY LUCKY, BECAUSE I SEEM TO HAVE CAUGHT THE FIRE WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF WHEN IT STARTED. I TOOK THE CAR INTO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, AND THE PROBLEM WAS THE CRUISE CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH. THEY REPLACED THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH AND A WIRING HARNESS THAT HAD BURNED (AT MY EXPENSE). THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  I CALLED FORD TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR WAS UNDER RECALL BACK IN 1999, AND THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED ON 7/7/1999 WHEN MY DAD OWNED THE CAR. THIS WAS ACTUALLY EVEN MORE CONCERNING TO ME, BECAUSE THE REPLACEMENT SWITCH, WHICH SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THE ORIGINAL SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION PROBLEM, SEEMS TO BE DEFECTIVE AS WELL!! SO MY CAR IS NOW ON ITS SECOND \"FIXED\" CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH. I AM ALSO CONCERNED FROM MY DISCUSSION WITH THE NHTSA REPRESENTATIVE. HE SAID THAT NO RECALLS CAN BE ISSUED FOR VEHICLES THAT ARE OVER 10 YEARS OLD. HE THEN TOLD ME THAT MY COMPLAINT WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING SINCE MY CAR WAS OVER 10 YEARS OLD. I DON'T EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIRE, HOWEVER, THIS IS DISTURBING TO ME KNOWING THAT MY COMPLAINT COULD BE DISMISSED OUT OF HAND. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM. ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH A CAR SETTING ITSELF ON FIRE WHEN IT IS NOT RUNNING. THIS COMPLAINT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY EVALUATED BEFORE DISMISSING IT. IF THE CAR HAD BEEN PARKED IN MY GARAGE WHILE I SLEPT, IT COULD HAVE EASILY BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE, OR KILLED SOMEONE.  *NM",

I KNOW, FROM EXPERIENCE, THAT IF THE ANTI-LOCK WARNING LIGHT APPEARS, THE SYSTEM \"IS\" MALFUNCTIONING.  MY CONCERN IS THIS.  I AM A POLICE OFFICER ALSO.  I'VE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL OF OUR FLEET CROWN VICS ARE REGULARLY EXPERIENCING THIS SAME PROBLEM.  SEVERAL OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE AREA ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THIS SAME CONCERN.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS HAS BECOME, OR IS RAPIDLY BECOMING, A CONCUMER CONCERN FOR ORERATORS AND OWNERS OF CROWN VICTORIAS AFTER THE MODEL YEAR 1992.  MY PERSONAL CROWN VICTORIA IS JUST NOW REACHING THE MILEAGE OF A SECOND YEAR POLICE VEHICLE.  I HAD THOUGHT THE POLICE VEHICLE CONCERN MIGHT BE DUE TO THE WAY THE VEHICLES ARE REGULARLY DRIVEN.  BUT, NOW THAT MINE IS DOING THE SAME THING, I WONDER IF THIS ISN'T A MATTER OF DETERIOATION DUE TO AGE.  IT WOULD APPEAR TO ME THAT A MANUFACTURER'S RECALL MAY BE IN ORDER.  ALSO, AS AN EVOC (EMERGENCY VEHICLE OPERATIONS COURSE) INSTRUCTOR, I KNOW THERE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS WARNING FEATURE AND ARE LEAVING THESE VEHICLES IN ACTIVE SERVICE WITH THIS DASH INDICATOR ACTIVATED.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND RESEARCH INTO THIS MATTER TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS AN ISOLATED CONCERN OR WIDESPREAD.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER THERE WILL BE ANY COST TO REPAIR RELIEF FOR THE REPAIR OF MY PERSONAL VEHICLE IF THIS IS DETERMINED TO BE A MANUFACTURER'S CONCERN.....THANK YOU",

IN THE SEAT FRAME ITSELF.  HAVE RESEARCHED 120 SEPARATE INCIDENTS OF THIS SEAT FAILURE CONDITION ON ODI CONSUMER REPORTS ON-LINE DATABASE ON FULL-SIZED FORDS, LINCOLNS, AND MERCURYS IN YEARS 1990-1996.  DEALER SAID MY CAR WAS \"OUT OF WARRANTY\" AND WOULD OFFER NO SATISFACTION/REMUNERATION FOR THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT.  WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY ANALYSIS OF THESE RELEVANT ODI LISTINGS SO NHTSA/ODI CAN PURSUE THIS WITH FORD.  HAVE COMPILED THEM INTO A 48-PAGE DOCUMENT AND ALSO A SPREADSHEET TO TOTAL THE FIGURES.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION POSSIBLY AFFECTING MANY THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES, INCLUDING MANY CROWN VICTORIAS USED AS POLICE CRUISERS.  SEVERAL DATABASE LISTINGS SHOW \"SEATS COLLAPSED\"  \"SEATS FLY OFF TRACK\"  AND SEATS SEPARATE FROM CAR FLOOR DURING ACCIDENTS.  I AM A 3RD GENERATION AUTO MECHANIC AND MANAGED A GOODYEAR AUTO REPAIR FACILITY FOR 6+ YEARS.  I KNOW CARS VERY WELL AND HAVE NEVER SEEN SEAT ASSEMBLIES BUILT AS POORLY AS THIS ONE!  JUDGING FROM THE ODI DATABASE, I AM FAR FROM ALONE IN HAVING THIS DEFECT ON A FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCT.  THEY MUST HAVE REENGINEERED THE SEAT SINCE THE PROBLEMS DROP OFF NOTICEABLY AFTER 1994.  I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD NOR COULD DISCOVER ANY RECALLS IN THE NHTSA/ODI DB FOR THIS REASON.  THERE WERE A FEW SERVICE BULLETINS.  BUT, NOTHING RESEMBLING A RECOGNITION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROBLEM.  A DRIVER CANNOT CONTROL A CAR IF HIS SEAT IS BROKEN.  THIS ALSO DEFEATS THE PROPER WORKINGS OF THE SEAT BELTS AND OTHER PASSENGER RESTRAINT SYSTEMS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A CALL OR E-MAIL REPLY TO DISCUSS THIS WITH NHTSA/ODI AND PURSUE THIS WITH YOU.

IF THIS WAS A TRADITION SEALED BEAM LIGHT, THE COST TO REPLACE WOULD BE $10.  THE DETERIATION IS ALSO VERY SUTTLE.  YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT THE LUMENS THE LIGHT ARE PROVIDING IS BEING REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE SUTTLE CHANGE IN THE LENS COVER OVERTIME.  THE LENS COVER CHANGES SO THAT IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THE HALOGEN BULB PROVIDES TO LIGHTING THE ROAD.  I NOTICED THIS CHANGE WHEN I WENT FROM DIRVING THE 92 CROWN VICTORIA TO MY NEW DODGE DACODA ON SOME BACK ROADS ON VERY DARK NIGHTS.  I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OF THE LENS COVERS NEED TO ADDRESS TO ASSURE THAT THEY WILL NOT DETERIORATE OVER TIME AND CAUSE THIS VISIBITY PROBLEM,  FORD SHOULD BE MADE RESPONSIBLE TO INSURE THE PLASTIC FOR THESE LENS ARE AS GOOD AS THE GLASS WAS FOR THE SEALED BEAM LIGHTS.  I KNOW THE DOT ALLOWED THE CAR MANUFACTURER THE ABILITY  NOT TO USE THE SEALED BEAM TO PROVIDE THE BENEFIT OF THE HALOGEN BULBS BRIGHTNESS, LESS ENERGY USED PER LUMIN, AND TO ALLOW A MORE GAS EFFENTS DESIGNS.
