IN SPITE OF STANDING ON THE BRAKE, TRYING TO GET THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND PUTTING MY TOE UNDERNEATH THE GAS PEDAL TO SEE IF IT WAS STUCK I WAS IN DANGER OF RUNNING UNDER THE REAR OF A SEMI.  MY 15 YEAR OLD SON REACHED OVER AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. I HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM GOING TO GET OFF THE ROAD. RECENTLY DIVORCED, I WAS SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN AND RETURNED IT TO THE DEALER WHO INSISTED NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR!  I TRADED IT IN AND TOOK A BIG MONETARY  LOSS  BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NEW. I WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED AT THE TIME.  NOW I AM WONDERING IF TOYOTA HAS BEEN COVERING UP THESE INCIDENTS A VERY LONG TIME AND IF ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM AS LONG AGO AS I DID AND WHETHER OR NOT THE INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED. I DO NOT BELIEVE TOYOTA INCIDENTS ARE NEW, NOR DO I BELIEVE IT IS A GAS PEDAL PROBLEM.  IT HAS TO BE A COMPUTER ELECTRICAL THING. AFTER OVER 20 YEARS OF NOT BUYING TOYOTA, JUST THIS THANKSGIVING BOUGHT A NEW TOYOTA HIGHLANDER AND NOW ALL THIS!!!!  GOT THAT ONE FIXED YESTERDAY, HOPEFULLY, BUT I STILL FEAR AN ELECTRICAL/COMPUTER PROBLEM. *TR",
