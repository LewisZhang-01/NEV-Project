I brought it in and the service department said there was a mistake and the fix wasn't available.  When I contacted them again the week of Oct. 25th they said they had a fix and made me a service appointment on Nov. 9th.  However when I went on NHTSA website it says that consumers will only be notified on Nov. 20th and when I called Toyota corporate they could not tell me when the fix would be available.  I have not been driving my car and I have been shocked that no one at Toyota seems to be able to tell me anything.",
