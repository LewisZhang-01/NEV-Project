At that time, the vehicle would not accelerate past 20 mph and showing about 4000 RPMs. This happened a few more times in our neighborhood, causing us to turn it off and restart in the middle of the road.  Since then, the Nissan dealership has changed the battery, claiming that it was the only computer reading.  Within two days of the new battery, it happened again to my husband in Orlando.  The dealership is unable to replicate the problem, and my husband and I are afraid as he uses the Pathfinder for travel with business to Atlanta.  These \"revving\" events occur randomly, and the dealership is unable to contact the Nissan engineers until they are able to replicate the problem.

Took me till the third time to correctly identify the problem.  Even if I turn off the 'AUTO', it comes right back on when you turn the car off and back on. Second issue is just really irritating.  I purchased the vehicle for the tow capabilities.  When you are towing and put the vehicle in reverse, it goes nowhere until you go thru about a dozen screens to turn it off the ABS system.  And it comes right back on when you turn the car off.  When I am in tow mode I should be able to go directly into reverse. Third issue is just irritation.
