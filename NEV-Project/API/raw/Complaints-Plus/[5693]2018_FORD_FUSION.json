It immediately came back on after this but unfortunately, it started to happen regularly upon startup, while driving, parked, just randomly, and for longer periods of time. It also started to increase the volume and I couldn't control it. The system completely stopped working after several weeks. I did a lot of research and noticed that this is a significant problem with Ford Accessory Protocol Interface Modules (APIM). Some have already been recalled on certain models of Fords and why they are not recalled on any that go out is beyond me. Seems that in and of itself would place some liability on the manufacturer in the event of an accident. The dealership wants to charge over $1,200 to replace the faulty APIM, which they described as a continued problem that everyone knows about. So maybe that is the reason it is not recalled. They can make money selling the vehicle and then another $1,200 after 40,000 miles when it goes out. I am very frustrated and will now be $1,200 less happy. Yes, I am frustrated at the financial impact, but it was a safety issue initially and at times startled me while driving, which could have caused an accident. I am sure that there are numerous examples of previous complaints that are able to prove this.",

I have not been in an accident I am filing this safety report and I am contacting Ford dealership to look at it to see if it could possibly be due to the recall that these cars have on them for the steering I don't know why if it is my VIN number wasn't included but I'm going to have Ford dealership check it out.

I ALSO NOTICED THAT WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED THE BLUE ANTI THEFT LIGHT CONSTANTLY FLASHES. AFTER THE BATTERY DRAINED AND THE PROBLEM RESET THEN I ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE LOCK BUTTON TWICE AND THIS IS WHEN THE BLUE LIGHY STARTED FLASHING AGAIN AND I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OUT OF PARK MODE. WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AT 40,000 MILES I WAS DRIVING THE INTERSTATE AND THE BLUE ANTI THEFT LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING AND THE CAR ALARM SOUNDED WHILE I WAS AT A 75 MPH SPEED. I HAD TO STOP THE CAR, TURN IT OFF, HIT THE UNLOCK BUTTON ON MY KEY FOB TO GET THE. ALARM TO STOP SOUNDING. I BELIEVE THE TWO ISSUES MAY BE RELATED AS THEY HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME. THE ORANGE WRENCH ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE CAR WILL NOT GO IN GEAR. WHEN THE CAR HAS EASILY GONE IN DEAR THE ORANGE WRENCH IS NOT PRESENT. AGAIN, I AM UNABLE TO ENGAGE THE NEUTRAL OVERRIDE BY USING THE KEY IN THE OVERRIDE SLOT. THE LIGHTS WILL FLASH ON THE DIAL BUT THE CAR WILL NOT GO INTO NEUTRAL, IT REMAINS STUCK. I HAVE TRIED MANY TIMES AND HAD OTHERS TRY IT AS WELL SO I KNOW IT'S NOT USER ERROR. CAR ALARM GOES OFF WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE.",

TOOK CAR TO A MECHANIC SHOP 8/29/2020 WHERE IT WAS LOOKED AT 8/30/2020.
