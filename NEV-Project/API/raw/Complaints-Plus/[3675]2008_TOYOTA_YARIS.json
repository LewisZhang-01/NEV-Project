        "summary": "My fiancee bought her 2008 Toyota Yaris on about the 26 Apr 2021. Right off she had brake failure pretty quickly after buying the car. Brake pads were suspected of failing. When the front tires were removed the calipers had built up thick rust on inside surface where the pads sit on both front calipers. The pads were pushed into the rotors heavily causing the driver side rotor to be damaged beyond acceptable limits. The right side rotor was turned successfully with enough rotor minimum thickness remaining. So the rust caused me to replace 1 rotor, both calipers and pads on front and rear brakes. The rust built up on the calipers threaded input and output brake fluid lines threaded attach points. This could have cause a fluid leak that could of been very dangerous leading to injury or death of occupants. I have not reported this to The Toyota dealership or anyone else. I didn't know I could report dangerous items that could be set for a safety recall by the NHTSA.   As for the airbags, the driver airbag light stays on and passenger light comes on when 10 pounds of weight is sat in passenger seat. The belt is not latched. My driver seat belt is always latched when I drive. I weigh 130 but  the light remains on. So, will the driver air bag inflator explode or  fail due to the warning light illuminatimg. I was unaware of a recall for this and 3 others have not been repaired yet by previous owners. The third item is backseat seatbelt female receptical will not latch to the male end on 2 of the 3 seating positions. This is a real safety issue when we place children in the backseat. We can only take 1 child at each drive, so even adults riding in the backseat will be not buckled up, which is un-law and very dangerous causing severe injuries and even death in an accidental collision. I will take my Fiancee's 2008 Yaris to a Toyota dealership for the 4 recalls noted today by VIN,7/29/2021. Thanks, Richard Peavler",

I BEGAN TO NOTICE A SOUND WHEN I MADE A SHARP RIGHT HAND TURN INTO A PARKING SPOT LIKE THE NOISE OF AN ACTUAL BAR AND ALSO A RATTLE IF I WENT OVER A SMALL DIP IN THE ROAD. I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED NEW TIRES ON 10/12/12 @ 29,645 MILES, I BOUGHT GOOD,SAFE TIRES:GOODYEAR EAGLE LS TIRES 185/60R15. ON 5/10/13 I HAD HER CAR SERVICED AT TOYOTA: OIL CHANGE, TIRES ROTATED, INSPECTION OF AIR FILTER, BALL JOINTS, ETC. AFTERWARDS, AS I WAS DRIVING MY DAUGHTER AND I UP TO MY SON'S COLLEGE GRADUATION IT WAS 80 DEGREES/SUNNY/CLEAR ROADS. 52 MILES INTO OUR TRIP I WAS IN THE SLOW LANE FOLLOWING TRAFFIC AT 65 MPH.WATCHING THE ROAD, BOTH HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STEERING WHEEL JERKED TO THE LEFT AND WE BEGAN TO GO INTO A SKID.I WAS AVOIDING OTHER CARS AS I WAS TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE YARIS. IT WAS BUCKLING UNDER ME EACH TIME I TRIED TO CAREFULLY GET US OUT OF THE SKIDS.MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE BRAKE BUT I HAD CAREFULLY PULLED IT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHY WASN'T THE CAR SLOWING DOWN, IT JUST KEPT SKIDDING. AFTER THE 4TH SKID IT WENT INTO A COMPLETE 180 DEGREE SPIN WITH US SLAMMING INTO THE CEMENT MEDIAN.I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AS WE WENT TOWARD THE WALL. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 35 YRS WITH NO ACCIDENTS AND I HAVE BEEN IN SKIDS BEFORE, ON ICY ROADS & REGAINED CONTROL. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE STEERING TO MALFUNCTION. I HAVE READ ABOUT FAULTY BOLTS ON THE CONTROL ARM. THE AUTO REPAIR SHOP DID TELL ME THEY REPLACED THE STABILIZER BAR.I HAVE NOTICED SINCE THE REPAIR THE NOISE UNDER THE CAR IS GONE AND THE THROTTLE NO LONGER \"SCREAMS\" WHEN I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS GOING DOWNHILLS. WE WERE NOT SPEEDING, NOR DRIVING CARELESSLY. THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE ABS NOR ANTI-SPIN BRAKES.  *TR",

HE SAID THAT IF I CONTINUED DRIVING IT THE ENTIRE PASSENGER SIDE SUSPENSION AND WHEEL WOULD LIKELY BREAK AWAY FROM THE CAR.  HE SHOWED ME A REPAIR BULLETIN THAT TOYOTA HAD PRODUCED DETAILING THE PROBLEM AND STATED THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS AN OBVIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND SINCE FAILURE OF THAT BOLT COULD LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY LOOKED UP THE BULLETIN AND SHOWED ME THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS ONLY COVERED AS PART OF THE BASIC 3 YEAR WARRANTY. I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR FROM THE DEALERSHIP THEY HANDED ME WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE BOLT THEY REPLACED AND THE OTHER BOLT THAT HELD THE CONTROL ARM IN PLACE.  BOTH BOLTS WERE BADLY CORRODED AND HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH NEW BOLTS THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME WERE A DIFFERENT PART NUMBER AND WERE CORROSION RESISTANT.  TOYOTA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ARE USING DIFFERENT PARTS THAN THE CARS WERE SHIPPED WITH FROM THE FACTORY.

THE PEDAL WENT HALFWAY DOWN, BUT THE ENGINE DID NOT RESPOND.  AS I QUICKLY TRIED TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO AS A CAR IN THE LEFT LANE BEHIND ME CAME UP FAST, THE ENGINE RESPONDED UNEXPECTEDLY AND I SURGED FORWARD. THE NEXT TIME I DEPRESSED THE PEDAL, IT RESPONDED NORMALLY AT THE TOP OF ITS TRAVEL.  HOWEVER, IT HAPPENED AGAIN ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER WHEN I WAS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT.  THE LIGHT CHANGED AND I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR.  AGAIN, NO RESPONSE.  THIS HAPPENED ON AND OFF UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN IT STARTED TO BECOME MORE COMMON THAN THE NORMAL RESPONSE.  SINCE I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY TOYOTA FOR AN EXPENSIVE FIX ONLY A FEW THOUSAND MILES AFTER MY WARRANTY RAN OUT, I RESOLVED TO GET USED TO IT. I ADJUSTED MY ACTIONS SO I DIDN'T EXPECT AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE CAR UNTIL THE PEDAL GOT PART WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND, THOUGH I'M SURE IT AFFECTED MY GAS MILEAGE, I COULD DEAL WITH IT.  THEN YESTERDAY, AS I PULLED INTO MY GARAGE, THE PEDAL RESPONSE SUDDENLY WENT BACK TO NORMAL AND I ALMOST WENT THROUGH THE BACK OF THE GARAGE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR (AND ONE FOR MY WIFE AS WELL)  BECAUSE OF TOYOTA'S REPUTATION FOR RELIABILITY AND ITS FUEL ECONOMY.  NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

I NOTICED AN INTERMITTENT NOISE ON D FRONT END SUSPENSION PASSENGER SIDE.  I BROUGHT TO D DEALER FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM, AFTER THEIR ASSESSMENT TOYOTA TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE SHOCK ABSORBER AND THEY WOULD REPLACE IT.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THERE WAS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH THE ALTERNATOR SAYING THAT THE VOLTAGE \"ISN'T UP TO STANDARD.\"  AFTER A FEW DAYS I GOT MY VEHICLE BACK FROM TOYOTA.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY REPLACED THE FRONT RIGHT SHOCK ABSORBER.  I ASKED THEM WHY ONLY ONE SHOCK ABSORBER WAS REPLACED AS THE USUAL PROCEDURE WAS THAT BOTH FRONT SHOCK ABSORBERS SHOULD BE REPLACED, THE SERVICE ADVISER TOLD THAT TOYOTA IS BECOMING MORE STRICT WITH WARRANTY POLICIES AND THE ONLY PART THAT THEY WILL REPLACE IS THE DEFECTIVE PART.  FURTHERMORE THE DEALER SERVICE ADVISOR SAID IF IT WAS UP TO THEM THEY NORMALLY ALWAYS REPLACE BOTH SHOCK ABSORBERS BUT BECAUSE OF TOYOTA'S STRICT WARRANTY POLICY THEY COULD ONLY REPLACE ONE SHOCK ABSORBER.  THIS SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER INSTANCE OF TOYOTA CUTTING CORNERS TO SAVE COST AT THE EXPENSE OF CAR SAFETY.  I LIVE IN MANILA,  PHILIPPINES AND I KNOW THAT THIS CASE OF MINE ISN'T IN YOUR JURISDICTION, I ONLY SUBMIT MY CASE TO YOU BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY YARISES THERE IN THE US THAT MAY HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

WHEN TRAVELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY IN SNOWY CONDITIONS THE RIGHT WIPER WILL ICE UP AND ATTACH ITSELF TO THE WINDSHIELD, THEREFORE MAKING THE LEFT ONE NOT WORK EITHER.  THE ONLY THING TO DO IS TO PULL OVER AND CLEAR IT BUT THAT IS ALSO AND AND ISSUE ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE SNOW OR RIDE IT TO AN EXIT TO CLEAR IT WITH ABSOLUTELY NO VISIBILITY.  IF THE WINDSHIELD HAD A HEATED STRIP AT THE BOTTOM OR THEY REDESIGNED THE DASH BOARD TO COVER THE LEFT WIPER.  THIS IS THE FIRST SNOW STORM I HAVE DRIVEN IN AND BY THE LOOKS WILL NOT BE THE LAST.  I AM CURRENTLY TRYING TO WORK WITH THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND HAVE PICTURES OF WHAT HAPPENS ON MY SONS PHONE TO SHARE.  I HAVE DRIVEN VEHICLES WITH LIMITED VISIBILITY AND HAVE DRIVEN TRUCKS FOR MANY YEARS.  IF THIS WAS TO HAPPEN TO AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER OR ONE THAT DOES NOT HANDLE THINGS WELL IT COULD HAVE BAD OUTCOMES.  I AM WRITING THIS TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND TO MAKE A RECORD OF FOR A HISTORY.  *TR",
