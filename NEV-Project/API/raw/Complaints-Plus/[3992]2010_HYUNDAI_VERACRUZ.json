I just got another letter on 7-22-21 saying the same thing that they have been saying for seven years with zero resolution yet in place.  I finally took the time to read the other complaints about electrical problems and the car seizing up nd being dead and this is exactly what is happening to my 2010 Hyundai Veracruz as I write this.  How can this ongoing problem not be addressed and fixed by Hyundai for over 7 years now!  What is the NHTSA doing about this?  I now am looking at a seriously expensive repair for this problem because Hyundai simply is ignoring all of the complaints about this dangerous situation.  The local dealerships I call don't want to touch it until the remedy is available or want us to pay for it and try and recover the cost later.  This is unacceptable and I want to know what this government agency NHTSA is doing about it.  Hyundai customer service is of no real help.  They just advise to get it fixed and hope for a remedy later, but this type of problem is truly dangerous and I do not want my family put in jeopardy of an accident due to the car going dead as it has done twice so far at my home.  Please make Hyundai solve this problem now and actively reach out to the owners of these vehicles with a solution that will cost nothing to the owners.  I am on social security and cannot afford to put out approximately $1,000 and hope to get it back someday from Hyundai. I feel Hyundai is allowing this problem to go on due to not wanting to spend the money to fix this problem while they hope that it just goes away.  Please do something NOW!!!",

In November of 2020 Hyundai admitted they were aware there was still problems with some gaskets, including with our car as we received a notice in the mail about a pending recall. In the last 7 months I have received 3 notices, but they all say that no repair has been implemented as of this time. This week we had to take our car in for the yearly required inspections in PA, and again our gasket is leaking. To pass inspection we had to replace it again, for the 3rd time. I called Hyundai and was told that I should have it done and submit my receipt for reimbursement because as of now there still is no fix. It is unimaginable to me that a company as big as Hyundai can be aware of a problem like this for more than 6 years and not come up with a permanent fix.",

        "summary": "RE:  NHTSA Recall Number 20V-705.  The engine value cover gasket leaks oil onto the alternator.  My engine has been smoking for six months (January 2021-present).  This problem was not repaired correctly under a previous recall in 2014.  In 2016 the problem persisted and my car shut off unexpectedly, causing me to stop in the high speed lane of the Massachusetts Turnpike, nearly resulting in a major accident and fatality.  The value gasket and alternator was replaced the day after the incident but the problem has emerged again.  I have received two notices from Hyundai in last few months under recall 197 stating that a \"remedy is being prepared\" following the NHTSA recall order of November 2020, but to date no remedy has been noticed.  Hyundai customer service suggests that I pay for the repair myself at the dealer and seek reimbursement from Hyundai America myself but I lack funds to do so.  As stated, the engine is smoking, the check engine light is on, and I fear for my family's safety.  This vehicle is needed for transportation to work and to purchase essentials.  Hyundai's response to this issue has not been timely.  By this complaint, I am respectfully requesting the NHTSA to order Hyundai to directly reimburse my local dealer for this critical repair so as to remedy this dangerous situation.

Yes, available for inspection. - The safety of our family was put at risk since we were left stranded at the airport on a late, hot Sunday with a broken car, & a two year old.  -The vehicle was inspected by our car shop at C & R, Tire: 602-493-5258 17434 N Cave Creek Rd, Phoenix, AZ  - The problem has been confirmed by the the important safety recalls we have received in the mail regarding Oil Leak on Alternator. - All maintenance up to date.   Hello, My husband and I bought a 2010 Hyunday, Veracruz in 2018 before the arrival of our first son. It has been our first family car. Last year we began to receive important safety recall notices (three total). We didn't think anything of it since the vehicle was working just fine and we keep up to date with the\u00a0maintenance of the vehicle. But then in the Fall of 2020 our car troubles began relating to oil leaks. I called the Hyundai dealership for help and was turned away, saying \"there was no current remedy\".\u00a0 Our first bill came out to over $1,200 this past Fall (2020). It was a significant amount of money but we were hopeful that the issues had been resolved at C & R tire shop. Less than 6 months later we were at our car shop again due to oil issues and having to make another significant payment of $1,560.17 on 3/02/2021. At this point we felt very discouraged but once again were hopeful that the car would run well after that. However, we were wrong.\u00a0 On Sunday, April 11th our\u00a0family of three: My husband, two-year-old son, and I went to the airport to pick up a friend. While we were waiting for her arrival all of the lights in our dashboard\u00a0lit up, the car died, and we were left stranded at the airport with no A/C and no way to get home. I ended up having to take an Uber with my son home and my husband spent hours at the airport trying to find a toe truck on a hot Sunday evening.\u00a0 After finding no remedy, we changed the alternator ourselves and problem is solved.",
