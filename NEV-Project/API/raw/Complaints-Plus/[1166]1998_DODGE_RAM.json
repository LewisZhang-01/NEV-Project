WHEN THE DOOR LOCKS' BRAKE, THEY ARE JAMMED LOCKED,  AND WE CAN NOT OPEN THE DOOR AT ALL.  WE CONTACTED THE DODGE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IF THEY UNJAM THE DOOR, THE DOOR WOULD THEN STAY OPEN!  WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK TO GET IT FIXED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ORDER THE PART.  THIS WILL END UP COSTING US OVER $200/00 - AGAIN.    I AM AMAZED AT YOUR QUESTION \"NUMBER OF FATALITIES\" .  BUT IT DOES BRING A CHILLING THOUGHT -   IF I WAS TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT WITH MY FIVE CHILDREN IN THE BACK -  THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT, AND IF A FIRE WAS TO IGNITE, I WOULD NOT EVEN LIKE TO THINK OF THE RESULTS!!!!!!  YOUR QUESTIONS SHOULD BE \"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE FATALITIES\" - THEN YOU WOULD GET A MORE ACCURATE NUMBER OF THE SEVERITY OF THE DEFECT.    MY (FIVE) CHILDREN NOW HAVE TO ENTER AND EXIT THROUGH THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR.  MY SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAD TO GET OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE THIS MORNING TO GO TO SCHOOL.  SHE FELL OUT AND HURT HER WRIST!    AS MENTIONED BEFORE, THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME ONE OF THE LOCKS BROKE ON THE DOORS.  TWICE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR, AND ONCE ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR.  IT IS OBVIOUS TO US THAT THE LOCKS ARE DEFINITELY DEFECTIVE - AND LIFE THREATENING!  I SEE FIRST HAND WHAT HAPPENS IN WRECKS, BEING A CAPTAIN OF THE LOCAL VOL. FIRE DEPT AND A MEMBER OF THE RESCUE SQUAD.    *PH",

THE TORQUE CONVERTER LOCKS UP BETWEEN 40 AND 53 MPH.  I WANTED THEM TO FIX IT.  THEY SAID ALL OF THE DODGE RAM  PICKUPS DO THIS.  THE WHOLE TRUCK STARTS TO SHAKE BETWEEN 40 AND 53 AND ITS DUE TO THE GEAR SETTING IN THE TRANNY AND THE ENGINE RPM.  THIS WAS DESIGNED BY DODGE FOR FUEL EFFECIENCY BUT CAUSES THE TRUCK TO SHAKE DUE TO TORQUE CONVERTER LOCK-UP.  I WAS SATISIFIED THAT IT WASN'T JUST A PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK WHEN THE DODGE DEALER LET ME PICK OUT A NEW DODGE ON HIS LOT WITH THE SAME SIZE ENGINE AND DRIVE TRAIN, IT HAD 6 MILES ON IT (BRAND NEW 99').  WHEN I DROVE THE NEW TRUCK IT WAS CONSIDERABLY WORST THAN MINE AND STARTED TO SHAKE BETWEEN 30 AND ABOUT 53 BUT IT SHOOK MORE THAN MY TRUCK THRU THE ENTIRE RANGE.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS SHAKING DUE TO TORQUE CONVERTER LOCKUP WON'T EVENTUALLY SHORTEN THE LIFE OF THE TORQUE CONVERTER AND POSSIBLY THE TRANSMISSION.  I FOUND YOUR SERVICE ON THE INTERNET, SO I AM GIVING IT A TRY.   THANK YOU",
