AFTER BACKING UP, WHEN I DROVE FORWARD, MY CAR SEEMED TO BE QUITE JUMPY AND WANTED TO LURCH FORWARDS. AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM HOME, WHILE I WAS STOPPED, I NOTICED THAT THE CAR STARTED MOVING FORWARDS. I IMMEDIATELY SLAMMED HARD ON THE BRAKE. THIS WAS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL AND SCARY. LATER WHILE GOING DOWN A HILL, I COULD SENSE THAT THE CAR WAS AGAIN QUITE JUMPY AND WANTED TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN. I STOPPED AT A SHOP FOR SOMETHING AND THEN WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE CAR AND TURNED ON THE ENGINE AGAIN, I NOTICED THAT THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT HAD JUST COME ON. I FELT THAT THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE AND HAD IT TOWED TO KLAHANIE CHEVRON IN ISSAQUAH, WA, VERY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE. I WAS LATER INFORMED BY THEM THAT THE ??IDLE CONTROL MOTOR?? FOR MY CAR WAS MALFUNCTIONING AND DUE TO THIS I WAS EXPERIENCING ALL THESE CAR ??JUMPINESS?? ISSUES. THE ??IDLE CONTROL MOTOR?? WAS REPLACED AND NOW THE CAR APPEARS TO BE RUNNING FINE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN UP TO DATE WITH MY CAR MAINTENANCE. THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS CAR IN WHICH THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN IS DANGEROUS AND MITSUBISHI ENGINEERS SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS FOR POSSIBLE RECALL\\REMEDIATION, SINCE THIS CAN GREATLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN THE CAR AND ANYBODY ELSE SHARING THE ROAD AT THAT TIME.
