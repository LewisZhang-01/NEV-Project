We noticed the squealing and vibration returned again. At our recent maintenance check, we asked to have the brakes and rotors inspected. We were told everything looked fine and nothing needed to be done, however we are still experiencing the vibration which is very troubling.   We called another place explaining the issue and they said that it sounds like we need new rotors. Our car has mostly been sitting over the last year and a half with very few added miles. We're curious to know why a car with less than 25,000 miles on it needed the rotors resurfaced and why with less than 60,000 miles it needs new rotors. The brakes on the Mazda SUV's seem to wear rather quickly or perhaps the incorrect brakes are put on for this size of vehicle. The increased vibration seems like a safety hazard",

THE DEALER SERVICE CENTER TOOK THE CAR AND TOLD US THE BATTERY HAD A LOW CHARGE, CHARGED IT AND RETURNED IT.    SEVERAL WEEKS LATER WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WITH 2 ADULTS AND 2 CHILDREN ON A CITY STREET TRAVELING AT ABOUT 20MPH IT GAVE THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS:    - KEYLESS ENTRY MALFUCTION  - CHARGING SYSTEM MALFUCTION  - VEHICLE OVERHEATING  - BATTERY MALFUNCTION  - PULL OVER TO SAFETY    AT THIS POINT THE VEHICLE WAS STILL IN MOTION AND THE STEREO, HVAC, AND POWER STEERING CUT OUT. I WAS ABLE TO PULL THE VEHICLE OVER BUT AGAIN HAD TROUBLE SHUTTING IT OFF. I HAD TO HOLD THE START/STOP BUTTON FOR 20-40SECS. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER SERVICE CENTER.    WE WERE TOLD BY THE SERVICE CENTER THAT A LOT OF 500 VEHICLES OF THIS YEAR AND MODEL HAD AN ENGINE HARNESS DEFECT THAT NO RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR BUT THEY WERE AWARE OF DEFECT AND HAD A FIX FOR IT.    I FEEL I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS ONLY TRAVELING 20MPH WHEN THE POWER STEERING CUT OUT. IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING HIGHWAY SPEEDS ON A BEND THE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC AND I HAD MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR.    CURRENTLY, BASED ON WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE DEALER SERVICE AND SALES MANAGERS THERE ARE POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF OTHER 2018 CX-9S WHICH COULD EXPERIENCE THIS SAME MALFUNCTION WHILE IN MOTION.",

I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON AND MY CAR JUST STARTED TO SLOW DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER IN TIME AND CALLED MAZDA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE BECAUSE AFTER THE CAR STOPPED, IT WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON. SINCE WE WERE ON A RESTRICTED HIGHWAY, MY CAR HAD TO BE TOWED AND WE WERE TAKEN TO A SAFER LOCATION. WHEN THE CAR WAS PUT DOWN, IT TURNED ON AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON AND THE FUEL GAUGE SAID THAT THE CAR STILL HAD 40 MILES LEFT. THE GUY THAT TOWED OUR CAR SAID THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FUEL ISSUE, SO WE WENT TO GET GAS. ONCE WE FILLED UP OUR TANK THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON BUT WE WERE ABLE TO REACH OUR DESTINATION. THE NEXT MORNING, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY RESTARTED THE CAR AND ACCORDING TO THEIR REPORT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR. THEY SAID THAT IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE BUT THEY HAD NO CLEAR REASON AS TO WHY THE FUEL GAUGE WASN'T STATING THE CORRECT INFORMATION. AFTER THE TRIP I, REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO MAZDA AND THEY DIDN'T ANSWER ME UNTIL TWO WEEKS LATER. THEIR RESPONSE WAS THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND THAT THIS WAS A ONE TIME ISSUE. I DID RESEARCH ON MY OWN AND DISCOVERIES THAT SOMEONE FROM SAUDI ARABIA HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE. SINCE MAZDA HASN'T BEEN WILLING TO HELP RESOLVE THE SITUATION I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I AM NOT WILLING TO PUT MY FAMILIES LIFE IN THE SAME RISK AGAIN.",

I SLOWLY (10 MPH) DROVE THE CAR INTO THEM WITHOUT TOUCHING THE BRAKE OR ACCELERATOR.  THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN OR WARN ME.(I TRIED SENDING A VIDEO TO YOU FROM MY IPHONE WHICH MAY NOT GO THROUGH)  I MADE AN APPOINT TO REPAIR THIS OBVIOUS FACTORY DEFECT AND SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT OLYMPIA LINCOLN /MAZDA(AND PUYALLUP MILAM MAZDA) REFUSED TO REPAIR IT  THEY STATED AND SHOWED ME A PRINT OUT FROM MAZDA FACTORY THAT FORBIDS REAL TIME TESTING AND STATED THAT IF THE TROUBLE LIGHT IS NOT ON THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO REPAIR OR REAL TIME TEST IT. I THINK THAT THE FACTORY IS AFRAID OF DEALING WITH A MASSIVE SAFETY RECALL.  TO COMPOUND THINGS THE ACTIVE LIVE TRAFFIC DISPLAY DOESN'T WORK EITHER WHICH MAKES MATTERS WORSE SINCE I CAN'T SEE WHERE AN ACCIDENT HAS OCCURS IN REAL TIME. I UNDERSTAND ITS DEFECTIVE IN MOST MAZDAS WITH NAVIGATION IN 2016 AND BEYOND.
