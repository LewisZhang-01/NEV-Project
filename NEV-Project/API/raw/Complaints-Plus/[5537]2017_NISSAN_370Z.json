        "summary": "The seal on the Clutch Slave Cylinder failed and contaminated the hydraulic system in the car. This prevented the car from being able to enter gear as the clutch could not be disengaged. This resulted in me being stuck in the middle of the road, unable to move the car unless I turned the car off, stuck it in gear, then started it up and gunned the engine at the same time. My car is a 2017, with only 31,000 miles on it. The dealership would not cover it under the power train warranty despite the fact that the CSC is located within the transmission casing and is an intrinsic part of the power train. Hydraulic cylinders are not a wear item. This should not happen at 31,000 miles.  Nissan was no help and only recommendation was Service Bulletin SB-10051926-2342, which recommends swapping the clutch fluid for a higher temperature fluid. This only solved the problem for about a week before the Concentric Slave Cylinder failed completely.  There is currently a lawsuit, Nguyen vs. Nissan North America, going through federal courts that in the process of discovery revealed through internal emails Nissan is aware that this failure is a result of a design flaw which makes it particularly susceptible to the kind of high temperatures developed inside the transmission. Please force Nissan to recall these parts. Its not right to have to pay 2000 dollars every other year to replace hydraulic cylinders in lightly used cars.",
