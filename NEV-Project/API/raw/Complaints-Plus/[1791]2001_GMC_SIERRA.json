Maintained well and garaged when possible.    1) Noticed a fuel smell from the driver side door area and after parking for a long weekend, a small pool of liquid formed in front of the driver side rear wheel.  It was fuel dripping from the line leaving the evap canister that had rusted through.  Resulted in a $600 repair to replace all rusted fuel lines so as to eliminate the risk of fire.     2) When approaching an intersection to make a left turn and slowing down the brake pedal pushes to the floor with no stopping power at all.  Used the engine/trans in manual mode to slow the truck down and avoid an accident.  Driver side brake lines are blown out in multiple spots near the ABS module due to corrosion. Potential cost based on research is in the $1000 ballpark.    This level of rust on critical vehicle components is irresponsible and potentially deadly.  GM needs to take this more seriously and realize that their cost-cutting measures are putting people and their families in grave danger.",

I WAS OUT OF TOWN ON THE 15TH OF AUG ABOUT 80 MILES FROM HOME AND PREPARING TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN TO ENTER ONTO THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED YELLOW AND THE DRIVER/CAR IN FRONT OF ME STOPPED SUDDENLY AND THANKFULLY PROCEEDED TO TURN HENCE GETTING OUT OF MY WAY BECAUSE WHEN I APPLIED MY BRAKES THEIR WAS NOTHING RIGHT TO THE FLOORBOARD, I HAD KNOWN WHAT JUST HAPPENED, RUPTURED A BRAKE LINE. I PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE TURN AND SOMEHOW GET THE TRUCK TO STOP WHILE GOING DOWN THE ON RAMP OF THE HIGHWAY. HERE IS MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH GM`S BRAKE SYSTEM. WHY WHEN 1 LINE RUPTURES ALL OF THE REST OF THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK TO AT LEAST GET THE VEHICLE TO STOP?  ONCE I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A LOOK UNDER THE VEHICLE I NOTICED ALL BRAKE LINES APPEAR TO BE STEEL AND IN TERRIBLE CONDITION, SO NEXT QUESTION, WHY ARE AUTO COMPANY`S ALLOWED TO USE STEEL BRAKE LINES AND NOT A CORROSION PROOF STAINLESS?? OH, WAIT TO SAVE MONEY FOR BIGGER PROFITS AND CEO BONUS`S. I JUST CAN`T BELIEVE IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH TECHNOLOGY WE CAN`T HAVE AN ABS SYSTEM WORK TO WHERE 1 LINE GOES YOU STILL HAVE SOME BRAKES FOR THE NAME OF SAFETY LIKE ON THE OLD CLASSICS WHERE EACH LINE IS INDEPENDENT TO EACH WHEEL. I`M JUST VERY LUCKY NOBODY WAS INJURED, COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THIS HAPPENED AT A HIGHER SPEED??? UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!",

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD A BRAKE LINE BURST DUE TO EXTERIOR CORROSION (RUST).  THE FIRST TIME A BRAKE LINE BURST IN THIS TRUCK WAS APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 YEARS AGO.  AT THAT TIME, WHILE DRIVING WITH MY 2 YOUNG SONS, APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR WITH NO RESISTANCE AND I WAS, FORTUNATELY, ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY TURN RIGHT, INTO A PARKING LOT.  AT THAT TIME, I REPORTED THE ISSUE ONLINE AT SOME WEBSITE, BUT I CANNOT RECALL THE NAME OF THE SITE. THIS TIME I CAME TO THIS WEBSITE. I NOW HAVE TO HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED, AND HAVE TO HAVE ALL RIGID OEM BRAKE LINES REPLACED, RIGHT HERE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THIS MOST RECENT INCIDENT, THE RUPTURE CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE FRAME RAIL, UNDER THE DRIVERSIDE SEAT. ALL OEM RIGID BRAKE LINES ARE SEVERELY RUSTED. THE PROBLEM IN THE PAST (THE FIRST INCIDENT) CAME FROM THE LAST 3 INCHES OF THE BRAKE LINE GOING TO THE LEFT REAR WHEEL BEFORE IT ATTACHES TO THE FLEXIBLE HOSE. NOTE THAT THIS TRUCK HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE MUD OR SAND, NOR HAS IT PUT ANY BOATS INTO THE WATER. ALSO, IT HAS NEVER PULLED/TOWED ANOTHER VEHICLE. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT PULL ANYTHING IN THIS MODEL OF GMC TRUCK WITHOUT REPLACING ALL OEM RIGID BRAKE LINES.   *TR",

FORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE WAS CLOSE TO HOME WHEN THE BRAKES FAILED AND WE MANAGED TO GET OUR TRUCK HOME WITHOUT INCIDENT.  WE LEFT OUR TRUCK PARKED OVER THE WINTER TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE WHEN THE WEATHER WOULD BE MORE COOPERATIVE FOR HAVING OUR VEHICLE TOWED TO A REPAIR SHOP. I CONTACTED GM EARLY MARCH 2011 REGARDING OUR PROBLEM AND GM SAID A GM AUTHORIZED DEALER HAD TO DIAGNOSIS THE PROBLEM.  WE HAD OUR PICKUP TOWED TO A LOCAL GMC DEALER AND THE DEALER?S SERVICE DEPT CHARGED US $98 TO INSPECT  OUR VEHICLE.  THE DEALER REPORTED BACK TO GM THAT THE CORROSION WAS CAUSED BY LACK OF MAINTENANCE.

I HAD THE RECALL PERFORMED ON OCT. 19, 2005 AND THERE WAS 47,249 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  I NOTICED A BRAKING PROBLEM LAST WEEK WITH MY TRUCK.  AFTER DOING A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I DECIDED IT WAS PROBABLY A ABS SENSOR PROBLEM.  I TOOK IT TO THE SAME DEALER THAT DID THE ORIGINAL RECALL.  THEY CHECKED WITH GM REGIONAL MANAGER AND SAID IT WAS ALREADY COVERED ONCE AND WOULDN'T COVER IT A SECOND TIME.  I HAD THE REPAIR DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP ON DEC. 8, 2010 AND THE MILEAGE WAS 65,849.  SO THE EFFECT OF THE RECALL ONLY LASTED 18,600 MILES.  I KNOW 5 YEARS HAVE PAST, BUT THE SAME ISSUE IN THAT FEW MILES?  I SENT AN EMAIL TO GM ON DEC. 9 AND THEY PHONED ME THIS MORNING.  SAID THE VEHICLE AGE WAS SUCH THAT THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.  IF I HAD 150,000 MILES OR SO ON THE TRUCK, I WOULDN'T THINK THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT GM ISSUED A RECALL ON AND FROM WHAT A UNDERSTAND, THE ORIGINAL RECALL DID NOTHING BUT REMOVE RUST FROM THE SENSOR AND TREAT THE SURFACE.  I WOULD THINK A RECALL WOULD LAST MORE THAT 18,600 MILES.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE HAD ANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT THE RECALL ONLY STALLING A PROBLEM LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD, BUT WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE CONCERN I HAVE.  THE BRAKES WILL FAIL AT LOW SPEEDS WHEN THEY ARE APPLIED AND THE MESSAGE CENTER IN THE DASH DOES NOT GIVE ANY MESSAGE.  THANK YOU. *TR",

I TRIED PUMPING THE BRAKES, BUT NOTHING.  BY THE GRACE OF GOD, NO ONE WAS HURT AS I CONTINUED INTO CROSS TRAFFIC AT THE INTERSECTION.  AFTER PULLING INTO THE CLOSEST GAS STATION, I FOUND THAT THE BRAKE LINES GOING FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER HAD BOTH BLOWN OUT.  ONCE I HAD THE VEHICLE HOME I INSPECTED THE BRAKE LINES AND FOUND ALL THE LINES IN EXTREMELY BAD CONDITION.  IN FACT THE LINES GOING TO THE FRONT BRAKES WERE SEEPING BRAKE FLUID. HAVING OWNED MANY VEHICLES, MOST OLDER THAN THIS ONE, I WAS SHOCKED THAT BRAKE LINES WERE IN AS BAD A CONDITION AS THEY ARE.  ESPECIALLY IN A VEHICLE THAT ISN'T EVEN 10 YEARS OLD YET.

NOW, 31,000 MILES & 3 YEARS LATER (81,000 TOTAL MILES), IT SHORTED-OUT AGAIN & NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST OF THIS PART ALONE IS $1,000.00 (+ OVER $200.00 INSTALLATION). THAT PART ISN'T EVEN SUBJECTED TO NORMAL 'WEAR & TEAR' LIKE BRAKES, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MOVING PART.  IT'S A COMPUTER MODULE THAT CONTROLS THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, THAT IS VITAL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BRAKING, WHICH LUCKILY I HAVEN'T NEEDED TO USE.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE EBCM (PART) IS DEFECTIVE ITSELF OR IF SOMETHING ELSE IS CAUSING IT TO SHORT OUT, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS PART SHOULD FAIL, THIS OFTEN. REQUIRING A THIRD EBCM IN 7 YEARS, IN MY OPINION, IS UNACCEPTABLE.  I'VE CONTACTED GMC & I DON'T THINK I RECEIVED A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR THE FAILURE OF THE PART'JUST A POOR EXCUSE.  HIS REASONING WAS THAT MY VEHICLE IS 7 YEARS OLD & HAS 81,000 MILES, THAT IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR A COMPUTER MODULE, WHICH CONTROLS THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES (A SAFETY ISSUE), TO MALFUNCTION & NEED REPLACING TWICE. THAT 'REASON' WAS TOTALLY ABSURD IN MY OPINION. MILEAGE SHOULDN'T COME INTO PLAY BECAUSE IT'S AN ELECTRONIC PART NOT A MOVING PART.  IF THEY WANT TO JUSTIFY IT BECAUSE THE TRUCK IS 7 YEARS OLD'.IT WAS THE PART THAT FAILED, NOT THE TRUCK & IT WAS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND ONLY 31,000 MILES HAD BEEN ADDED, WHEN IT SHORTED-OUT AGAIN!

THEY THEN TOLD ME THAT IF IT WAS THE ABS MODULE, IT WILL COST ME $1,111.99 TO REPLACE IT. I AM A MECHANIC AND FEEL THAT IF THE MODULE IS BAD, THE DEFECTIVE SENSORS CAUSED IT AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. MY VEHICLE IS STILL DOING THE EXACT SAME THING IT WAS RECALLED FOR.

        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 GMC 2500HD 4WD, AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, EXTENDED CAB, SHORTBED, 6.0 LITRE GAS ENGINE. PURCHASED IN OCTOBER 2000. THE TRUCK IS COMPLETELY STOCK EXCEPT FOR AN TIRE UPGRADE TO 285/75 R16.  ON DEC 17, 2003, I TOOK A WIDE LEFT TURN ON TO A STREET. AFTER MAKING THE FIRST LEFT, THE STEERING FELT STRANGE. WHILE MAKING THE SECOND LEFT THE POWER STEERING DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY AND SO DID THE BRAKES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOW HEADING TOO WIDE RIGHT AND I WAS STOMPING ON THE BRAKES TO TRY AND STOP IT.   I ALMOST RAN INTO A POST TO THE RIGHT OF THE TURN. LUCKILY THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC AND I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE TRUCK TO A STOP.  THE POWER STEERING WAS COMPLETELY GONE AND SO WERE POWER BRAKES. I HAD TO MUSCLE THE 8600 LB. TRUCK BACK AND FINISH THE TURN IN A VERY PHYSICAL MANNER. THIS WAS NO EASY TASK. I DROVE IT A SHORT WAY HOME VERY SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY.   I DISCOVERED THE POWER STEERING PULLEY SHAFT HAD SHEARED INSIDE THE POWER STEERING PUMP. I REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP.THE DAY AFTER THE SECOND UNIT WAS INSTALLED, THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I SNAPPED THE SAME SHAFT ON THE SECOND PUMP. FEARING I HAD JUST RECEIVED A BAD PART, I AGAIN REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP.   I SPOKE TO MANY MECHANICS SPECIALIZING IN FRONT END AND STEERING WORK. THEY HAVE ALL CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE SAME PUMP THAT HAS BEEN USED IN OLDER GM TRUCK MODELS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS NOW THE PUMP PROVIDES ADDITIONAL WORK TO THE POWER BRAKE ASSIST. THIS IS BEYOND THE ABILITY OF THE OLDER DESIGN PUMP, ORIGINALLY ONLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE POWER STEERING.   THE SITUATION THAT MOST COMMONLY OCCURS WHEN THIS PUMP FAILS IS USUALLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AND DURING A TURN. TO LOSE CONTROL OF THESE HEAVY TRUCKS IN THIS INSTANCE IS DANGEROUS AND COULD VERY LIKELY CAUSE AND ACCIDENT.  I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT AND THE IMMEDIATE LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL THAT HAPPENED TO ME. THERE ARE MANY OF THESE TRUCKS OUT THERE THAT HAVE THIS SAME FLAW. *AK",
