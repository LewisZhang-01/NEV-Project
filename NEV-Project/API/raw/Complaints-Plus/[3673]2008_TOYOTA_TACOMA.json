YESTERDAY, SUNDAY, IT SEEMED MORE NOTICEABLY STIFF. I RESEARCHED MORE AND READ THAT IT MIGHT BE DUE TO A CORRODED SHAFT ' MANY RECOMMENDED GREASE AS A SOLUTION AND OTHER RECOMMENDED A NEW SHAFT. TODAY IT WAS VERY STIFF AND EVEN A BIT WOBBLY ' MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. I WAS READING UP ON HOW TO REPAIR THIS AND CAME ACROSS MANY OTHER WHO EXPERIENCED THIS AND SUGGESTED I FILE THIS SO THAT OTHERS MIGHT BE WARNED/PROTECTED.

TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER DRIVING 1000 MILES, THE BURNING INCREASED TO EXTREME SHOOTING NERVE NEEDLES FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF MY NECK DOWN BELOW AND ABOVE MY SHOULDER BLADE, DOWN BELOW AND ABOVE MY RIB CAGE IN THE AREA OF MY HEART, AND AROUND THE BACK OF MY SHOULDER, DOWN THROUGH MY ARM PIT, UP THE FRONT OF MY SHOULDER AND INTO MY ROTATOR CUFF. ALL OF THIS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND ALL EMANATING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF MY NECK, ALL THE WHILE THE BACK OF MY NECK WAS STILL BURNING. PLEASE EXCUSE THE LONG SENTENCE.    THE PAIN WAS REDUCED BY 500MG OF ASPIRIN AND 500MG OF IBUPROPIN. THE NEXT DAY I HUNTED ROCKS, BENDING AND STRETCHING, AND WORKED MOST OF THE PAIN AWAY BY STRETCHING THE MUSCLES OUT.    AS SOON AS I STARTED MY RETURN TRIP, THE PAIN RETURNED, ALL THE SAME AS ABOVE. AS I WAS RUBBING MY NECK I NOTICED THAT MY TRUCK DOES NOT HAVE A SHOULDER STRAP. IT HAS A NECK STRAP, SINCE THE ENTIRE STRAP WAS TIGHT UP AGAINST THE LOWER PART OF MY NECK, JERKING MY NECK EVER TIME THE TRUCK MADE A TURN OR HIT A BUMP. FOR THAT MATTER, EVERY TIME I MOVED MY BODY, THE SHOULDER STRAP PRESSED AGAINST MY LOWER NECK. WHEN I PUT THIS NECK STRAP BEHIND MY BACK, THE PAIN SUBSIDED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. NOW I HAVE TO HAVE THE STRAP BEHIND MY BACK EVEN IN THE CITY, OTHERWISE THE PAIN IN MY NECK IS THERE ALL THE TIME.    SO, FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS, ALL MY NECK PAIN HAS BEEN CAUSED FROM THE DEFECTIVE SEAT BELT, AND I WANT IT FIXED/REPLACED. IT IS ILLEGAL TO DRIVE WITH THE SHOULDER BELT BEHIND MY BACK.

I WENT TO COPELAND TOYOTA, IN BROCKTON, MA, (WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE) AND WAS TOLD THAT THE BROKEN SPRING WAS DUE TO OLD AGE.  I THEN WENT BACK TO SULLIVAN TIRE AND HAD THEM REPLACE THE LEAF SPRINGS ON MY TRUCK.

WHEN I CALLED COPELAND TOYOTA TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE LEAF SPRINGS THEY SAID IT WAS TOYOTA'S PROBLEM.  I CALLED TOYOTA IN TORRANCE, CA SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS TOLD I HAD TO WAIT FOR A SECOND NOTICE (REMEDY) BEFORE I COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR REIMBURSEMENT.  IT HAS BEEN ALMOST AN ENTIRE YEAR AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A SECOND NOTICE (REMEDY) LETTER TO FIND OUT HOW I CAN SUBMIT THE DOCUMENTS I HAVE FOR REIMBURSEMENT (PAID INVOICE FROM SULLIVAN TIRE AND CANCELLED CHECK FROM MY BANK FOR THE WORK THAT WAS DONE).  I HAVE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE SECOND LETTER TO COME AND I THINK 12 MONTHS IS FAR TOO LONG FOR ME TO WAIT TO GET SOME INFORMATION FROM TOYOTA REGARDING HOW I CAN GET REIMBURSED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FRACTURED SPRING.

THE TRUCK WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT IN 2011.  BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO INSPECT THE FRAME AND HAVE A RECALL ADDRESSED.  AT THE TIME I WAS TOLD IT WAS MINOR SURFACE RUST AND THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.    FAST FORWARD TO APRIL, 2012 WHEN I SENT AN EMAIL TO TOYOTA MOTOR CO., THEIR RESPONSE WAS FOR ME TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER AT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  IN THE SAME EMAIL I WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE'S FRAME WARRANTY WAS FOR 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES.  FAST FORWARD TO AUGUST/SEPTEMBER OF 2013.  I SPOKE WITH THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE FRAME TO BE INSPECTED.   WHEN THE TRUCK WAS ON THE LIFT THE SERVICE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN CARE TO LOOK AT THE FRAME.  THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP IS NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING ME AT THIS POINT.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE AMOUNT OF FRAME RUST ON THE TRUCK IS \"NORMAL'.  THEY SUGGEST I HAVE THE RUSTY FRAME UNDERCOATED.  IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.  THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS OF THE FRAME THAT HAS SEVERE CORROSION.  MY CONCERN IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FRAME CRACKING, ETC.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, WHILE I'M DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.

UPON PULLING OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATED (SIDE TO SIDE) AND  CAR BUCKED (FRONT TO BACK)   THERE WERE LOUD GRINDING AND BANGING NOISES. CAR PULLED STRONGLY TO THE LEFT.   I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR .  INSTEAD OF SLOWING,  THE ENGINE  SUDDENLY REVVED UP.    DUE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON BOTH SIDES OF US, I  FOCUSED ON STEERING US OUT OF TROUBLE BY KEEPING US IN OUR LANE.   I DID NOT APPLY BRAKE. I  HAD THOUGHT THAT WITHOUT GAS, THE CAR WOULD GRADUALLY SLOW DOWN ON ITS OWN.  INSTEAD OF SLOWING THE ENGINE REVVED UP!     TRUCK  SUDDENLY LURCHED 90 DEGREES TO LEFT, JERKED STEERING WHEEL OUR OF MY HANDS   VEHICLE LURCHED INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE,  WHOLE  FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE ASSEMBLY CAME OFF AND HEADED ONE WAY AND THE TRUCK WENT THE OTHER.  WE WERE THROWN FORWARD, DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT.  THE VEHICLE KEPT MOVING  UNTIL WE CRASHED INTO CONCRETE ENTRANCE/EXIT OF DEALERSHIP.  I PUT ON EMERGENCY BRAKE.  DEALER SAYS \"SIMPLE HUMAN ERROR MECHANIC FORGOT TO TIGHTEN BOLTS ON TIRE\"  I THINK THIS GOES WAY BEYOND A TIRE PROBLEM.  THEY MESSED WITH COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM AND  THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.   I CAN'T SEE HOW TIRES CAUSE ENGINES TO REV UP.   UPDATED 01/28/11 *BF  UPDATED 02/07/11  *TR",

IT APPEARED THE BRAKES WERE WORKING BUT NOT CATCHING AS FAST AS USUAL SO I PUT EXTRA PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE. GETTING TOO CLOSE THAN I SHOULD BE FOR A STOP, I PUSHED THE BRAKE TO THE FLOOR & MY TRUCK DIPPED A BIT APPEARING TO COME TO A STOP BUT THEN KEPT ROLLING & HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THE CAR SEEMED TO MOVE FROWARD JUST BEFORE THE TAP AS IF IT WERE GOING TO MAKE THE TURN AT THE STOP SIGN SO THE IMPACT WAS LOW. THE CAR THEN STOPPED BUT SINCE MY TRUCK HADN'T, ALTHOUGH MY FOOT WAS STILL HAD THE BRAKE TO THE FLOOR, I PUMPED MY BRAKE AND STOMPED IT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN AND MY TRUCK LAUNCHED OUT SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AGAIN.

EVEN IF THAT HAD HAPPENED CAUSING THE SECOND HIT, THE FIRST HIT THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED ANY PANIC WAS BECAUSE THE BRAKE DID NOT WORK.

NOTE THAT THE TRUCK DOES NOT HAVE A USER CONTROLLABLE TORQUE LIMITING OR TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO SLOWLY TRAVERSE A GRASSY SURFACE WHILE IN TWO-WHEEL DRIVE THE VEHICLE INVOLUNTARILY CAME TO A STANDSTILL.  THE ENGINE HAD LOST POWER AND THE VEHICLE REFUSED TO MOVE.  THE REAR WHEELS DID NOT SUFFER ANY LOSS OF TRACTION IN OTHER WORDS THEY DID NOT LOSE TRACTION AND SPIN AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO SPIN.  APPLYING FULL THROTTLE DID NOT HELP; ALTHOUGH NOT MISFIRING WHILE RUNNING SMOOTHLY, THE ENGINE LACKED MEANINGFUL POWER AND WOULD NOT GAIN ANY SIGNIFICANT RPMS UNDER ANY THROTTLE POSITION.  THERE WERE NO ABNORMAL GAUGE READINGS OR INSTRUMENT PANEL WARNING LIGHTS INDICATING A PROBLEM.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT WORKING THE TRUCK FREE BY GOING FROM NEUTRAL TO DRIVE I WAS ABLE TO MOVE IT ONTO PAVEMENT BUT, WHILE ON THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT A GROSS LOSS OF POWER AND HAD DIFFICULTY ATTAINING EVEN 40 MPH.  AFTER DRIVING SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE ROAD, THE FAULT EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND THE ENGINE RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL ENERGETIC SELF.  BECAUSE THE VEHICLE'S PERFORMANCE RETURNED TO NORMAL (AND IT WAS SUNDAY) IT WAS NOT TAKEN TO A REPAIR SHOP.     ON ARRIVING AT MY DESTINATION, I CONNECTED A OBD2 DIAGNOSTIC TOOL TO THE VEHICLE BUT NO TROUBLE CODE WAS INDICATED.  (THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF WATER IN THE VEHICLE'S GASOLINE AND THE GASOLINE WAS FRESH AND OF PROPER OCTANE; THE ENGINE OR IGNITION SYSTEM WERE NOT WET.  NO POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE POWER LOSS WERE OBSERVED.)     AN UNEXPLAINED LOSS OF ENGINE POWER IN A MOVING VEHICLE CAN PROVE DISASTROUS IF NOT DANGEROUS.  ATTEMPTS AT CONTACTING TOYOTA IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY A CAUSE AND REMEDY FOR THE PROBLEM HAVE PROVEN FUTILE. *TR",

I TOLD HIM WE WERE NOT INJURED AND I WAS SORRY FOR THE WALL. I WENT INSIDE AND CALLED THE POLICE AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I EXPLAINED IN BOTH REPORTS THAT THE ACCELERATOR KEPT GOING EVEN WITH THE BRAKE FULLY APPLIED. INSURANCE COMPANY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE BODY SHOP FOR REPAIRS, I AM WAITING TO GET IT BACK, BUT NO ONE HAS ADVISED ME ABOUT THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM.

THE ACCELERATION AND POWER OF THE ENGINE WAS SO GREAT THAT THIS ALL HAPPENED IN ABOUT 3-5 SECONDS.

THEREAFTER I TRIED TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROBLEM. THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGED PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATION WAS THAT I ACQUIRED A BLACKBERRY CURVE TO REPLACE MY PREVIOUS CELL PHONE.  MY OLD CELL PHONE WAS SMALLER, SO WHILE DRIVING I USUALLY KEPT IT IN THE SLOT NEXT TO MY GEAR SHIFTER.  MY BLACKBERRY WAS MUCH BIGGER AND DIDN'T FIT IN THE SLOT.  THEREFORE I PUT IT IN THE CUP HOLDER UNDERNEATH MY DASHBOARD.  IT WAS THEN THAT I STARTED EXPERIENCING THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, I STARTED CARRYING MY BLACKBERRY EITHER IN MY BACKPACK ON THE PASSENGER SEAT OR IN THE SLOT WHERE I USED TO KEEP MY SMALLER CELL PHONE AND I NO LONGER CHARGE THE BLACKBERRY USING THE CHARGER THAT PLUGS INTO MY LIGHTER SOCKET IN MY DASHBOARD.

I HAD JUST COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AT A RED LIGHT WHEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ROAR.  WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE TRUCK FROM MOVING FORWARD BY APPLYING ADDITIONAL BRAKING PRESSURE. A MAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO CROSS THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK HEARD THE NOISE AND JUMPED BACK ONTO THE CURB TO AVOID BEING HIT. THE TRUCK PROCEEDED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND APPROX. ANOTHER 100 FEET BEFORE THE RPMS RETURNED TO NORMAL AND THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THERE WAS NO CROSS TRAFFIC AT THE TIME THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED. APPROX MILEAGE IS 10K.    PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:    1 - MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE, NOT THE GAS PEDAL, AND I DO NOT DRIVE USING BOTH FEET,          AND MY SHOE SIZE IS 8.  2 - THE FLOOR MAT WAS LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR WHEN THIS WAS HAPPENED.  3 - I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN RPMS THAT HAPPENS WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING CYCLES, AND THIS WAS SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND THAT.    THIS IS THE 5TH TOYOTA PICKUP I HAVE OWNED IN THE PAST 12 YEARS, AND THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF THIS ISSUE.    THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DESIGN OF THESES TRUCKS AND IT CAUSES AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN IT OCCURS.
