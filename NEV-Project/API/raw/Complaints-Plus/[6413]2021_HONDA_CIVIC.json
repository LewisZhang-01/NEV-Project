My life is in danger if I'm trying to make a turn across traffic when I have a space to do so and I CAN'T make the turn SAFELY because the car has \"stalled\" by not moving forward quickly after I let go of the brakes. It's a brand new car, and I took it to Honda. They said they couldn't replicate the incident. Since it happens sporadically, I have no idea what causes it but I DO know that it's VERY dangerous.  Another issue happens when I'm driving in cruise control. Another car is in a turning lane, and my car will slow down abruptly. The car is in the NEXT lane, not in my lane, so having my car suddenly slow down is very dangerous as I can get rear ended. Again, this is dangerous.",

Screeching like you cannot believe b/c when this happens, the top of the plate is flexed onto the top of the brake rotor and it goes metal to metal.  Honda told me they have no idea how this happened but myself, a professional mechanic can clearly see exactly what happened.  Honda tried to bill me for this warranty repair to the tune of $475. I told them \"NO!\" They backed down.   Yes, this vehicle is available for inspection any time you want.
