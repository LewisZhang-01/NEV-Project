        "summary": "ON JUNE 26TH AS I WAS RETRIEVING MY NEW 20' SWEETWATER TUSCANY 2086 PONTOON BOAT ON ITS 2010 EZ LOADER TRAILER (MODEL: EZP 18-20 SN:[XXX] ), I GOT THE BOAT HALF WAY UP THE RAMP WHEN THE BOAT WENT OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRAILER. THE WINCH STRAP AND SAFETY CHAIN WERE CONNECTED AND I KNEW THE BOAT WAS SITTING ON THE FRONT BUNKS WHEN I STARTED UP THE RAMP.     THE REAR BUNK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRAILER BROKE OFF AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE FRONT BUNK ON THE SAME SIDE.     UPON INVESTIGATION, THE HEADS OF THREE OF THE CARRIAGE BOLTS HOLDING THE BUNK BRACKETS TO THE TRAILER WERE SHEARED RIGHT OFF. THEY ARE ACTUALLY RUSTED WHERE THE HEAD ATTACHES TO THE BOLT. (PICTURES AND/OR PARTS AVAILABLE) NOTE: THE TOP OF THE BOLTS ARE MARKED 3074 W.T    WITH THE BOLTS HOLDING THE BRACKET TO THE TRAILER MOUNTED AT THE EXTREME END OF THE SLOT IN THE BRACKET, THERE IS A LOT OF STRESS PUT ON THESE BOLTS. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS ROOM TO ADD A SECOND BOLT TO HOLD DOWN THE BRACKET, THIS WAS NOT DONE.      THE DEALER'S (RAY'S MARINA-RV IN MILTON, NH) RESPONSE TO MY CONCERNS WAS 'UPON LOOKING AT THE TRAILER AND SPEAKING TO THE REP. AND SEEING THE DAMAGE IT IS APPARENT THAT THIS WAS NOT A DEFECT IN THE MATERIAL. IT APPEARS THAT THE BOAT WENT ON INCORRECTLY AND WAS THEN POWERED ONTO TRAILER. ALL THE BOLTS NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRAILER THE BOLTS WERE STRETCHED/WEAKENED'.     MY MAJOR CONCERN FROM A SAFETY FACTOR IS THE INTEGRETY OF THE CARRIAGE BOLTS USED ON THIS TRAILER.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",
