        "summary": "Center pin in front leaf springs is not long enough to enter hole in front axle which, keeps them from moving side to side and front to rear. This caused axle to move front and back egg shaping the spacers and causing u bolts to loosen. This could have been catastrophic if it had not been caught by mechanic after I noticed something not being right. The front axle could have folded under the weight of the truck had I had to apply the brakes hard to stop which could have caused a terrible accident. This has kept me in the shop for over a week. Now I have a huge bill and a truck note to pay because of negligence on behalf of western star trucks.There are other trucks that have experienced this same problem and no cure found from western star not to mention how many truck are on the highway right now with the same issue like a ticking time bomb. They have denied responsibility for this but, the truck came from their factory this way and the new springs had the the same size center pin so, the mechanic had to find longer center pins that would actually go down into the axle. I have some pictures and crows truck center in Memphis did the work and we have kept all of the old parts. The mechanic notated his findings on the invoice.",
