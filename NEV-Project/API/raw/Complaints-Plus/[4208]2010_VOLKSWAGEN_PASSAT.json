FEARING THAT IT WOULD DIE WHEN HE PULLED ONTO THE HIGHWAY, HE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG. AFTER LOOKING AT THE ENGINE HE DECIDED TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AS SOON AS HE COULD. APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK LATER MY SON WAS DRIVING THROUGH TOWN.  HE HAD TRAVELED LESS THAN THREE MILES WHEN HE PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS.  NOT HAVING ANY NOTICEABLE ISSUES THAT EVENING, HE WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT WHEN HE TRIED TO START HIS CAR IT WOULDN'T TURN OVER.  IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WANTED TO, BUT WAS MAKING A STRANGE NOISE THAT IT HADN'T BEFORE.  WE DECIDED TO LEAVE IT PARKED AND HAVE IT TOWED THE NEXT DAY.  AFTER LOOKING AT IT THE MECHANIC INFORMED US THAT THE TIMING CHAIN HAD SLIPPED DUE TO A FAULTY TENSIONER, CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE. BECAUSE OF THIS THE ENGINE WILL HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED.  WE ARE SO VERY THANKFUL THAT OUR SON WASN'T HURT, OR EVEN WORSE.

I LEFT THE CAR IN PLACE FOR A TOW TO NOT DAMAGE THE VEHICLE ANYMORE THAN IT ALREADY WAS. IT WAS TOWED TO THE VW DEALERSHIP IN TOWN WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PCV VALVE STOPPED WORKING CORRECTLY, WHICH CAUSED THE REAR MAIN SEAL TO FAIL AND BECOME COMPLETELY DESTROYED. THEY SAID THAT THE ENTIRE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT TO REPLACE THE SEAL AND IS GOING TO COST $1700. VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THE SCREECHING NOISE AND DID NOT HAVE ANY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON DURING THE PROBLEM. VEHICLE HAS JUST OVER 100,000 MILES AND VW OF AMERICA DENIED TO HELP OUT IN ANYWAY WHEN CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE.

THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT VW WAS AWARE OF A PROBLEM (I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW HE WORDED IT - BUT HE MENTIONED CARBON BUILDUP AS THE CAUSE) AND THE FUEL INJECTORS WERE UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY SO NO CHARGE FOR THE INJECTORS BUT I WOULD BE CHARGED $465.00 IN RELATED COSTS PLUS I WOULD NEED ANOTHER OIL CHANGE IN 500 MILES TO FLUSH THE ENGINE (ANOTHER $80.00).  I ASKED ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE OTHER TWO INJECTORS FAILING AND PERHAPS CAUSING ME TO CRASH MY CAR.  HE SAID THAT IF I HAD MORE CARBON BUILDU, IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

THE ENGINE LIGHT NEVER CAME ON; HOWEVER, THE D (DRIVE) LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING, AND I REALIZED THAT THE CAR WAS IN LIMP MODE.  IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER, WHICH HAD SERVICED THE CAR EVERY 10,000 MILES, (AND HAD ACTUALLY REPLACED THE TURBO RECIRCULATION VALVE AT 39,637 MILES AS A RESULT OF MY CONCERN THAT THERE WAS A BURNING SMELL WHILE DRIVING).  ROSEVILLE VOLKSWAGEN DIAGNOSED THE CURRENT PROBLEM AS BEING THE MULTI-CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, AS WELL AS A FAULTY INTAKE MANIFOLD.  THE INTAKE MANIFOLD IS COVERED BY A VOLUNTARY EXTENDED WARRANTY; HOWEVER, THE MULTI-CLUTCH ASSEMBLY IS NOT COVERED IN 2010 SEDANS.  IT APPEARS THAT VOLKSWAGEN DID EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON 2007-2009 MODELS FOR THE MULTI-CLUTCH ASSEMBLY; AND IT APPEARS FROM SEVERAL THREADS (VWVORTEX.COM, FORUMS.TDICLUB.COM, MYTURBODIESEL.COM, VWEOSCLUB.COM) THAT THE MULTI-CLUTCH ASSEMBLY CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN 2010 MODELS.  VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA IS TAKING NO RESPONSIBILITY TO EXTEND MY WARRANTY, WHICH EXPIRED AT 85,000 MILES.  I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER APPEARED, AND THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING ON A FREEWAY, INSTEAD OF ON A STREET NEAR HOME.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROBLEM MAY HAVE BEGUN APPROXIMATELY 20,000+ MILES AGO, AS I AGAIN SMELLED A BURNING SMELL AT THAT TIME, AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER TO IGNORE IT, AS IT WAS PROBABLY A PLASTIC BAG THAT WAS BURNING ON THE ENGINE.  HOWEVER, THE SMELL LASTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, AND I NOW REALIZE FROM READING THE THREADS THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEGINNING OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE MULTI-CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.  *TR",

AUTOHOLD BUTTON IS WORKING. IF THE AUTOHOLD BUTTON IS NOT ON, A CAR IS STILL ROLLING BACK ON A MILD SLOPE SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FOOT QUICKLY FROM BRAKE TO GAS AND PRAY THERE IS NO CAR BEHIND YOU. 2010 VW PASSAT PERFORMS VERY WELL AFTER YOU REACH 60 MILES AND OVER BUT BELOW THAT SPEED, IT TAKES TIMES TO PICK UP A SPEED. SOMETIMES, THE GAS PEDAL HITS THE FLOOR AND A CAR IS STILL NOT PICKING UP THE SPEED. DRIVING IN A SPORT MODE DOES NOT HELP, SINCE THE TRAFFIC IS ON STOP AND GO.  *TR",
