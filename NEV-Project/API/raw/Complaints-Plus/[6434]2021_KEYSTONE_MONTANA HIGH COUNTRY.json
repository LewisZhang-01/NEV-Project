Under certain conditions if the 120VAC connections are wet for an extended  period of time it can lead to an increased risk of fire and/or damage to personal property.  I have been trying to get this recall rectified and Keystone and its dealers will not take my unit in. I purchased the RV in IOWA and now I'm working in California.   They say they cant make their dealers take it in, no dealer will take the unit unless it was purchased from them.  They have left me no recourse.  Along with a plethora of other electrical issues.",
