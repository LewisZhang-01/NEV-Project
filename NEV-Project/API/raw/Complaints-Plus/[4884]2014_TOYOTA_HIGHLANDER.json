THERE IS SOMETHING VERY HARD TOWARDS THE  BACK OF THE SEAT.  I COMPLAINED TO THE SELLING DEALER AND THEY RECOMMENDED COMING BACK WHEN THE ZONE REP WAS IN AREA.    I RETURNED A WEEK LATER AND MET WITH THE ZONE REP.  SHE HAD ME SIT IN ANOTHER HIGHLANDER LIMITED AND ASKED IF IT FELT DIFFERENT, IT DID FEEL THE SAME.

THE SHOP CUT ABOUT 1/2 INCH INTO THE FOAM AND BURIED THE MODULE AND PLACED THE CUT OUT FOAM ON TOP OF IT.  THEY ALSO DID THE SAME FOR THE SEAT BACK.    I REQUESTED DEALER TO REIMBURSE ME THE $200.00 IT COST TO HAVE THE ABOVE MENTIONED WORK DONE;  THEIR RESPONSE WAS THEY WOULD REQUEST TOYOTA TO COVER THE COST.  A WEEK LATER I LEARNED THAT TOYOTA REFUSED TO PAY FOR A MODIFICATION THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND THEY FELT THE PLACEMENT OF THE MODULE WAS NOT A DEFECT.    I THEN ASKED THE DEALERSHIP TO REIMBURSE ME AND THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID TOYOTA WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE THE EXPENSE.  I TOLD HIM I WORKED FOR A GM DEALERSHIP AND SAW MANY MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE APPROVED BY GM.  HIS RESPONSE WAS \"CHEVROLET HAS TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO SELL CARS AND TOYOTA DOESN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY SELL CARS AS FAST AS THEY ARE MADE.
