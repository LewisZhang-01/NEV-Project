DRIVING 70MPH ON FREEWAY WITH 2013 20FB UNDER TOW. LOUD EXPLOSION, WIFE REPORTS WHOLE TREAD OF TIRE SHOOTING OFF TRAILER, SECOND LOUD EXPLOSION SECONDS LATER.AFTER REPLACEMENT OF TIRE AND INSPECTION OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE TIRE - NO TREAD WAS FOUND ON TIRE. TIRE SHREDDED BADLY.     REVIEWING THE MANUFACTURES REAL INFORMATION: HTTPS://WWW.MICHELINMAN.COM/COMMERCIALLIGHTTRUCKS.HTML    THEY MATCH THESE CLOSELY BUT WITH DIFFERENT DOT NUMBERS.     THERE WAS NOT A COLLISION WITH DEBRIS OR OBJECTS ON THE ROAD. I RELIGIOUSLY CHECK TIRE PRESSURE BEFORE EACH DAY OF TOW. I BELIEVE THESE PRODUCTS ARE DEFECTIVE AND REQUIRES INVESTIGATION TO KEEP OUT ROADS SAFE. TODAY NOBODY WAS HURT, THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE TOMORROW.     NOTE: WHEN SELECTING THE VEHICLE INFORMATION THE BRAND AIRSTREAM WAS NOT LISTED SO I SELECTED ARCTIC FOX TO CONTINUE.
