Upon calling Fiat, they said it was covered under warranty - BUT- there is one part that is crucial to the install and the part costs $7,000.   Our car is not worth 7k.  We bought it for 10k four years ago and it has depreciated value.   When we appealed with Fiat - they would not budge.  We filed a claim for loss damages and it goes denied - twice.

Ever since I bought this 2015 Fiat 500e [it is battery electric] in 2017 with NO warning all kinds of trouble/service lights will go on as the car shuts down & stops as if it was thrown into Park, & most of the time it does this it is at highway speeds on crowded L.A. freeways, which has become very close to getting me killed several times I have taken it to local dealers for this problem since shortly after I bought it in 2017, long before the bumper to bumper warranty expired. Most of the time the dealer reads/clears the codes, then parks it in a back lot for days, weeks, & months, then after a while tells me it's done & I can pick it up, but normally within 100 miles the exact same thing happens so I have to take it back to the dealer. Most recently it did not even make it off the dealers lot before it did it. The latest dealer I have been taking it to for this problems, [5 times in a few months] clearly doesn't know the car or what they are doing & is now brazenly lying on repair orders. They have also been claiming it had no problems or trouble codes when I brought it in, after the service writer read & printed out dozens of codes, which they promised to give me a copy of but then refused to give to me. Because this is the exact same problem covered by previous recalls on this car I believe dealers have charged for services & doing recalls that they did not do, because I marked the parts & see NO indication they changed the parts required or did the procedures required to perform the services claimed. This car has had the exact same dangerous problems covered by the recalls since I bought it & I must now pay dealers to service it even though the propulsion system is under warranty.

SINCE THE CAR WAS A 2015 MODEL THAT I HAD PURCHASED NEW AND IT WAS 2018, I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN SO I HAD FIAT PICK UP THE VEHICLE AND INSPECT IT. THEY SAID THEY DID NOT FIND THAT THE FIRE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY ERROR. I THEN HAD MY INSURANCE COMPANY TAKE IT AND CLOSE THE CLAIM. STILL FIND IT STRANGE THAT A 3 YEAR OLD CAR SUDDENLY CAUGHT ON FIRE WITH NO WARNING. I'M GLAD I WAS ABLE TO MOVE OFF TO THE SIDE AND THAT I WASN'T IN THE CAR WHEN IT CAUGHT ON FIRE FULLY.

WORKED FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND FAILED AGAIN, SO TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME DEALER WHO REPLACED THE CTM (CONVERGENCE TELEMATICS MODULE).  THE NEW CTM THEN CAUSED INTERFERENCE TO THE SATELLITE RADIO, SO NOTIFIED THE DEALER.  WAITED A WEEK AND NO RESPONSE, SO DECIDED TO CALL SIRIUSXM MYSELF FOR SIGNAL RESET.  ALL GOOD FOR ANOTHER MONTH UNTIL THE BLUETOOTH DISPLAY FAILED AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME.  SO BASICALLY SAME PROBLEM EVERY MONTH SINCE PURCHASE AND PER THE DEALER, THERE ARE SIX OTHER FIATS AT HIS DEALERSHIP WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND CANNOT BE FIXED.  TALKED TO MY CASE MANAGER AT FIAT CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO IT.  ANOTHER MONTH HAS PASSED BY AND STILL NO RESOLUTION TO THIS MATTER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTON FAILS AND STOPS DISPLAYING INCOMING CALL INFO ON THE CLUSTER, ONE HAS TO LOOK AT THE PHONE TO SEE WHO IS CALLING, WHICH TAKES ATTENTION OFF OF THE ROAD - EXACTLY WHAT THE DISPLAY SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT.",
