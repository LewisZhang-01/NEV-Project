It was late afternoon and sun was shining. The road surface was dry. There were no vehicles immediately in front of or along the side of mine.  I had not activated the lane keeping assist or automatic cruise control features. Only the hazard mitigation/automatic braking and road departure mitigation features were operational.  The car suddenly attempted to swerve left, away from the center of the lane being utilized. The automatic braking system also activated. I was able to simply \"drive through\" the malfunction without incident.  This was the first instance I have noted of this kind.  Due to the fact that it was late afternoon, there were shadows from overhead power line being cast onto the lane being driven. I have owned previous cars that sometimes attempted to track said shadow when the lane keeping assist is activated. That was not the scenario yesterday as LKAS was not selected.  It was as though the sensors detected a pending pedestrian strike or other collision.",

There was clearly some kind of failure in the collision mitigation breaking system. Previously, the orange \"BREAK\" light sometimes came on the dashboard if you got too close to the car in front but it was always accurate--there always was a car in front of us. But this time it was really startling because there was nothing in front of us and it almost caused an accident because the car behind us obviously wasn't expecting us to stop suddenly. We have a 2021 Honda CRV hybrid and have had no other problems with it. We haven't had any maintenance on it in besides a bit of standard care (oil change, tire rotation) so I assume whatever problem it has has been there since the purchase (we are the car's original owner).

My husband called the Honda dealer were we bought the car asking for an urgent appointment to have the car inspected, but they did not call him back as he asked.

        "summary": "Nothing has happened yet. I want it on record that the implementation of this feature is dangerous. On P.497 of the 2021 CR-V Hybrid's Owner's Manual is the following warning:  \"Exiting a vehicle that has been stopped while the ACC with Low Speed FOllow system is operating can result in the vehicle moving withoug operator control.  A vehicle that moves without operator control can cause a crash, resulting in serious injury or death.  Never exit a vehicle when the vehicle is stopped by ACC with Low Speed Follow.\"  The way this feature is implemented, the following scenario is possible: I'm driving in heavy traffic that stops for a long time. I absent-mindedly forget that the CR-V is still in ACC mode and get out of the car to see if I can see what is causing the delay. While away from the car, traffic starts to move, and before I can get back in it, the CR-V drives away. Were there a child in the car or an adult who didn't drive, there could easily be multiple deaths caused by a driverless vehicle speeding up to the current ACC setting (which could be a freeway-appropriate speed).  Just off-hand I can think of multiple ways to prevent such a scenario, each of which takes advantage of existing systems: The ACC could--and should--automatically disengage and the transmission go into Park 1) when a door is opened; 2) when the driver's weight leaves the seat; 3) when the driver's seatbelt is unfastened.  It should not be possible for a vehicle to drive away without a driver, and this possibility could--and should--be easily prevented.",

This to me is a big safety concern as it adds extra pressure to the seatbelt buckling in, should there be an accident.
