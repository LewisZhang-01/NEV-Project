When i went to have them replaced at a discounted price, i could not because i had to put a spare tire on (it is considerably smaller) causing the tread on one tire to be slightly uneven from the others. so this voided the warranty. Now tell me how passenger side and driver side front tires both end up with sidewall bubbles and one blows out within a week apart? Nothing changed in my driving routine. Bought two nearly new tires to maintain my ability to get around, and a third tire develops a bubble and had to be replaced. The last tire is slowly leaking!? i drive to work and back. I live less than 2 mins from my place of employment. i do still have my paperwork from buying the tires. btw the warranty was never registered correctly because when i tried to call about it they had no idea where to find it. i had to send all sorts of paperwork to them and still got no results.",

THE NEXT MORNING I TURNED IT ON TO DRIVE TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AND THE BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING AGAIN. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND APPARENTLY THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL OF CAR BUILT BEFORE OCTOBER 2009. MINE WAS BUILT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2009. AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY CHARGED US A FEE TO DIAGNOSE IT AND REPROGRAM THE COMPUTER RESPONSIBLE. THEY SAID IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE ENTIRE MODULE REPLACED WHICH WOULD COST UPWARDS OF $2000 PLUS 8 HOURS OF LABOR.

WHY? MANY OWNERS HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FORD FUSION CARS. SEE:LAST WEEK'S RECALL COVERS 389,585 2012-14 FORD FIESTA AND 2013-14 FORD FUSION AND LINCOLN MKZ CARS. FORD SAYS THE DOOR LATCH IN THESE VEHICLES MAY EXPERIENCE A BROKEN PAWL SPRING TAB, WHICH TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A CONDITION WHERE THE DOOR WILL NOT LATCH. IF A USER LATCHES THE DOOR, THERE IS POTENTIAL THE DOOR MAY UNLATCH WHILE DRIVING. FORD IS AWARE OF TWO ALLEGATIONS OF SORENESS RESULTING FROM AN UNLATCHED DOOR BOUNCING BACK WHEN THE CUSTOMER ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE IT. DEALERS WILL REPLACE ALL FOUR DOOR LATCHES.IN MARCH 2017, FORD RECALLED 213,000 2011-13 EXPLORER SUVS AND POLICE INTERCEPTOR UTILITY VEHICLES IN NORTH AMERICA BECAUSE THE SPRING THAT CONTROLS THE INTERIOR DOOR HANDLES MAY PREVENT THE DOOR FROM LATCHING COMPLETELY. FORD SAID IT WAS A DIFFERENT ISSUE THAN THE NEW RECALL. IN JANUARY, FORD RECALLED 204,945 2010-13 TAURUS, LINCOLN MKS AND POLICE INTERCEPTOR. NHTSA UPGRADED AN INVESTIGATION INTO HUNDRED OF COMPLAINTS OF DOORS FAILING TO LATCH OR FLYING OPEN INTO NEARLY 486,000 2011-13 FIESTA CARS. NHTSA RECEIVED 207 REPORTS RELATED TO THE PROBLEM, WITH 65 DOORS OPENED INADVERTENTLY WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

THE NEXT DAY I FOUND OUT FORD HAS A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM #13N03 TO REPLACE THIS KNOWN DEFECTIVE PART IN FORD FUSIONS AND OTHER MODELS. THE WARRANTY FOR THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY WAS EXTENDED TO 10 YEARS AND 150,000 MILES. MY CAR IS 8 YEARS OLD AND HAS UNDER 100,000 MILES.

THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY IN MY FUSION HYBRID IS THE EXACT SAME PART THAT IS IN THE FUSION THAT IS COVERED IN THE PROGRAM.  IT IS THE EXACT SAME DEFECTIVE PART IN MY HYBRID THAT CAUSED THE SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED A SAFETY ISSUE NECESSITATING THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM. IF A  DEFECTIVE PART IS KNOWN TO CAUSE A SAFETY ISSUE AND THE WARRANTY ON A PART IS EXTENDED DUE TO THE SAFETY ISSUE, THEN THAT SAFETY ISSUE APPLIES TO ALL MODELS THAT HAVE THE KNOWN DEFECTIVE PART. TO EXCLUDE A PARTICULAR MODEL THAT CONTAINS THE DEFECTIVE PART FROM THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM, IS TO MINIMIZE THE SAFETY OF CERTAIN  CITIZENS.

THREE WEEKS LATER SAME    WARNING WHEN I WENT TO START IT.  TOWED TO DEALER AGAIN, TOLD FAULTY PART, WOULD BE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, NO CHARGE.  WENT DOWN TO LOOK AT CAR AND ASKED ABOUT PRO-ACTIVELY USING RODENT TAPE BEFORE INSTALLING NEW PART AS A PRECAUTION TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE PROBLEMS.  WAS SHOWN THAT THERE WASN'T ANY VISIBLE DAMAGE.  CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY TO TELL ME THERE WAS RODENT DAMAGE TO WIRING HARNESS THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN, THAT THEY HAD CUT OPEN THE WIRING COVER AND FOUND THE WIRES CHEWED. MY QUESTION AS TO HOW THEY KNEW TO CUT OPEN THE SHROUD TO FIND THE CHEWED WIRES IN THE SHROUD WAS ANSWERED THAT THERE WAS A \"PIN-HOLE\" \"TOOTH-HOLE\" IN THE SHROUD, BUT 3 OF THE 4 WIRES WERE SEPARATED. . THEY COULD TRY TO FIX WIRING FOR ABOUT $400.00.  SPOKE TO SERVICE MANAGER AND HE AGREED TO REPAIR IT AND ABSORB THE $400, AS IT WAS ABOUT 3 HOURS LABOR AND WOULD ONLY \"COST\" THE DEALER ABOUT $60.00.  NEXT DAY HE CALLED TO SAY THEY REPAIRED THE WIRING BUT STILL DIDN'T WORK, SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE PART AND IT WOULD COST ME ANOTHER $1,997.80.  THIS WAS FRIDAY AND I SAID I'D CALL HIM ON MONDAY.  I THINK IT IS ABSURD THAT A CONSUMER IS FORCED INTO A $2000 REPAIR FOR A WIRE, AND BELIEVE THERE IS A FAULTY DESIGN WHICH WOULD RENDER A $2000 PART USELESS WHEN A WIRE IS CUT.",

THE HYBRID BATTERY WOULD DRAIN VERY QUICKLY AND THE REGENERATION MOTOR RAN CONSTANTLY AND SOMETIME VERY ROUGH.  I MANAGED TO DRIVE IT TO MY MECHANIC.

LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CARS AT THE FOUR-WAY STOP. IF THERE WERE CARS THERE, I COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO A CAR ACCIDENT, EVEN WORSE IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY. WHEN THE BRAKE ISSUE OCCURRED, THE FOLLOWING TWO SYSTEM ERROR CODES APPEARED ON MY DASHBOARD: 1.) \"(!) BRAKE CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM\" AND (2) \"SERVICE ADVANCETRAC\". AT THE SAME TIME THAT THESE TWO SYSTEM ERROR CODES APPEARED, THERE WERE FIVE WARNING LIGHTS THAT APPEARED: 1.) ADVANCETRAC/TRACTION CONTROL OFF LIGHT (AKA  ORANGE-YELLOW CAR W/ TIRE MARKS OFF)  2.) ADVANCETRAC/TRACTION CONTROL (AKA ORANGE-YELLOW CAR W/ TIRE MARKS SYMBOL) 3.) BRAKE SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT (AKA RED !(P) BRAKE) 4.) ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (AKA \"ABS\" SYMBOL) WARNING LIGHT 5.) ON THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER TO THE LEFT OF THE SYSTEM ERROR CODE \"(!) BRAKE CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM\" A LITTLE (!) BRAKE SYMBOL APPEARED.  I HAVE A PICTURE OF ALL OF THESE SYSTEM ERROR CODES AND LIGHTS. SO, THEN I USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HANDLE STICK TO STOP THE CAR AND THAT HELPED ONLY TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN BY 20%, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE CAR. I LEFT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON AND DID NOT USE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO SLOW DOWN THE CAR.  THE CAR SLOWED DOWN TO A SLOW STOP AFTER 1-2 MINUTES AFTER DRIVING OVER SOME SPEED BUMPS DRIVING AT 30-35 MPH. WHEN IT STOPPED, I RESTARTED THE CAR TO SEE IF THAT WOULD FIX THE ISSUE AND IT DID NOT. SO I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL VERY LIGHTLY WITHOUT USING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND GOT TO A SPEED OF LESS THAN 10 MPH TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE I WAS ALMOST THERE.  WHEN I SLOWLY DRIFTED INTO MY WORK'S PARKING LOT, I IMMEDIATELY USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AGAIN TO GET THE CAR TO STOP.",

CAR WAS FINE UNTIL 10,000 MILES LATER. SAME PROBLEM, LOSS OF POWER STEERING. FORD DEALER IN DAYTONA BEACH, FL SAYS THEY FOUND AN OVER TEMP CODE AND RESET CODE. THEY COULD FIND NOTHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE CAR THAT WOULD CAUSE LOSS OF POWER STEERING. DROVE ANOTHER 1,000 MILES AND LOSS OF POWER STEERING AGAIN IN VIRGINIA. TOOK CAR TO NEAREST FORD DEALER IN PRINCE GEORGE, VA. THEY REPLACED FRONT CONTROL ARMS. DROVE ANOTHER 600 MILES AND LOSS OF POWER STEERING AGAIN. WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FIRST FORD DEALER IN FRANKFORT, KY AND THEY SAY THEY NEED TO REPLACE THE RACK ON IT, BUT IT IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NEXT OR WHERE TO TAKE THE CAR. NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM....UPDATED 10/01/15*BF",

FORTUNATELY THE ONCOMING DRIVERS WERE PAYING ATTENTION AND STOPPED WHILE WE WERE STOPPED, TURNING OFF THE IGNITION AND RESTARTING TO REGAIN ABILITY TO ACCELERATE.  IN RESEARCHING ONLINE AND TALKING TO THE LOCAL FORD MECHANIC, IT LOOKS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE FORD FOCUS.  THE PROBLEM CENTERS AROUND THE THROTTLE BODY AND SENSORS, CAUSING A DISENGAGEMENT WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE.  SO FAR WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE AND HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT BUT I CAN NO LONGER PUT MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE UNTIL IT IS REPAIRED.  IT IS JUST TOO UNSAFE WITH THIS ISSUE.",

I TOOK IT INTO FORD AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE A/C UNIT CIRCLING ON AND THAT THIS WAS NORMAL.

I WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THE GUY THAT WAS WORKING ON MY CAR TOLD ME AT THAT POINT THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY AND AT THAT POINT IT WAS STILL COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY BUT THAT IF HE WERE TO REPLACE IT AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ONE THAT CAME OUT OF MY CAR, I WOULD BE CHARGED FOR IT. SO, BEING SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN EXTRA $700 LAYING AROUND, AND BELIEVING THE DEALERSHIP, I CHOSE TO GO ON DRIVING MY CAR AS IT WAS. TODAY WAS THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT. I WAS DRIVING DOWN A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY, GOING CLOSE TO 60 WHEN MY CAR DECIDED TO TURN OFF TODAY. THIS HAS NOW HAPPENED 5, YES 5 TIMES.

IN THE FALL OF 2011, I PURCHASED A DIFFERENT 2010 FORD FUSION FROM OUR FLEET AS IT WAS BEING TURNED IN, AND THIS IS THE VEHICLE THAT I AM DISCUSSING IN THIS FORUM.  IT ONLY HAS 30000 MILES ON IT, BUT IS 6 MONTHS OUT OF THE 36 MONTH BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. THE CAR STALLED ONCE, A MONTH AGO, AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO RECTIFY ITSELF.  THEN YESTERDAY, 6/19/2013, IT STALLED 6 TIMES.  MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DRIVES THE CAR AND WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION.  FOR ALMOST ONE MINUTE, THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART, BUT FINALLY DID, AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE INTERSECTION.  AS I READ THE FORUMS, IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM, LOOKING BACK, I'VE HAD 2 CARS WITH THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE MEN AT THE DEALERSHIP KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS SPECIFIC TO THE THROTTLEBODY, WHICH IS DEFECTIVE, AND THERE IS OVER A WEEK BACKLOG ON THE PARTS AS MORE AND MORE CARS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM, TO LOSE POWER TO A VEHICLE IN MOTION AND FORD IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, YET THEY ARE TAKING NO STEPS IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.  IT IS GOING TO COST ME $600 TO HAVE THE PART REPLACED, AS IT IS OUTSIDE THE 3 YEAR WARRANT, YET FORD KNOWS THAT THIS WAS A MODEL WIDE ISSUE WITH A DEFECTIVE CAR PART.  I AM DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY THAT A GLARING PROBLEM SUCH AS THIS IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED DUE TO FORD ATTEMPTING TO LET THE PROBLEM HOPEFULLY JUST FADE AWAY AND NOT BE TAKEN TO TASK OVER THIS ISSUE.  I PRAY THAT THE NHTSA WILL STEP IN, RIGHT A WRONG, AND IN THE PROCESS PREVENT A TRAGIC ACCIDENT BEFORE IT BECOMES A REALITY.   *TR",

WHILE STOPPED FOR A FEW SECONDS, I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET, COLLIDING INTO THE REAR BUMPER OF THE MARINER. MY FUSION BUMPER SLID UNDER THE MARINER BUMPER CRASHING THE GRILL AND CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE (APPROXIMATELY $5000) TO THE FRONT END AND HOOD OF MY FUSION.  I AM UNCERTAIN AS TO WHY THE CAR ACCELERATED. I HAD NOT HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE DURING MORE THAN 50,000 MILES OF DRIVING. IT MAY BE THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE GAS ENGINE IDLE AND/OR THE START OF THE ELECTRIC MOTOR MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CAR TO ACCELERATE TO A SPEED WHICH WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE BUMPER TO SLIDE UNDER THE MARINER'S BUMPER. I HAVE QUESTIONS  RELATIVE OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS FOR FUSION HYBRIDS AND AS TO WHY THE BUMPER DID NOT FUNCTION AS REQUIRED BY REGULATIONS TO PROTECT THE CAR FROM DAMAGE WHEN TRAVELING AT SPEEDS OF UP TO 5 MPH. I HAVE MADE INQUIRY OF FORD RELATIVE TO THE SAFETY ISSUES , HOWEVER THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIVE IN A PHONE INTERVIEW, WHICH WAS QUICKLY TERMINATED INFORMING ME THAT THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WOULD CONTACT ME.

THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH NO ANSWER. TWO WEEKS AFTER, I WAS HAVING STEERING WHEEL PROBLEMS. IT WOULD SHAKE(\"RATTLE\") WHEN COMING TO A STOP(BREAKING) AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING OVER 45 MPH.
