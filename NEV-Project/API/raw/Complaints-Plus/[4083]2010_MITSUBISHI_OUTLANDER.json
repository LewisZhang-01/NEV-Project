Less than 3 years later this vehicle is immovable because of the exact same reason as the original recall. The technician obviously overlooked areas of which to spray the rust preventative in which caused the structural integrity to completely fail at the front mounting location of the driver side control arm onto the crossmember. This vehicle is not safe to drive any longer because of Mitsubishi's lack of thoroughness in performing and evaluating the situation and the condition of said crossmember. High Point Mitsubishi now insists that the issue was resolved even after clear pictures have been sent showing the clear damage and obvious nature of the reasoning of the recall in the first place but argue that they took care of the recall although obviously the exact issue that the recall was made for is thr reason this vehicle is no longer driveable.",

I ALSO HAD TO REPLACE MY BATTERY IN NOVEMBER, 2013; IT WAS LESS THAN 3 YRS OLD.  THEY TOLD ME THEN (BACK IN NOVEMBER) THEY WERE ORDERING A NEW ALTERNATOR FOR ME (COVERED UNDER WARRANTY).  IT IS NOW THE END OF MARCH AND WHEN I CALLED MY LOCAL MITSUBISHI DEALER AGAIN, AND THEY TOLD ME THERE IS A 1,000 UNIT BACK ORDER ON THE ALTERNATORS ON THESE VEHICLES, AND THE NEW, I AM GUESSING REDESIGNED UNIT, WOULD NOT BE OUT UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF MAY.
