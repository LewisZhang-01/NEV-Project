        "summary": "I am filing a complaint concerning my recent experience with the Audi service department located in San Rafael, California. On May 24, 2021 I brought my 2019 Audi A4 in for service due to an error message stating, \"Front parking aid: malfunction! Obstacles cannot be detected\". I purchased the car in December 2019 from the dealership in Burlingame, California.  It was previously used as a loaner car, and to my knowledge the car was in original condition with no prior bodywork done on the vehicle.  When my car was inspected by the dealership in San Rafael, they discovered the error message was the result of a faulty left center front parking aid where pinched wires were found from a previous bumper repair/ removal. I was told that this work required immediate attention, wasn't covered under warranty, and the total cost of repair was $784.29.  I explained to the service advisor, Gene Frank, that the car had never been in a collision since I owned it, and Gene stated that this is a common problem with Audi cars and if he filed a claim with the company, it would be rejected. Gene argued that my car may have been hit in the front by another car on the street, and when I asked why the front of the car doesn't show damage, he explained it was due to the plastic coating on the outside of the surface.  Based on the pictures taken by the service inspector and the reasoning for this damage, I argue that this damage was due to a faulty wire. The car is garage kept, has low mileage, has never been in a collision, and has never had body work performed on it. For all these reasons, I dispute the cause of this wire damage. I want Audi to take responsibility for this repair, recall this type of wiring, and refund me the total amount paid for repair.",

WHILE IT DID NOT STOP THE CAR COMPLETELY IT DID REDUCE MY SPEED SIGNIFICANTLY.  AT THE TIME I WAS THE ONLY CAR ON THE ROAD; THAT IS, THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS WITHIN SIGHT OF MINE. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE THAT I CAN SEE TO THE CAR BUT I TRUST YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH WORSE SITUATION IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND ME.   I ALSO TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS UNEXPECTED BRAKING IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE AUDI SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME HE HAS SEEN THIS PHENOMENON BEFORE BUT AUDI HAS NO EXPLANATION OR  SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.",
