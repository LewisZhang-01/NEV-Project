THIS TOYOTA EMPLOYEE STATED, SHE WAS SURPRISED THAT NO ONE THAT EVER WORKED ON THE TOYOTA TRUCK SAID THERE WAS AN ISSUE.    I FIND THIS VERY IRONIC SINCE TOYOTA KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND DID NOT CONTACT THE OWNERS OF THE VEHICLE. THE FRAME IS RUSTED COMPLETELY THROUGH TO THE POINT THAT IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE  IS MY DAUGHTER SUPPOSED TO REPLACE A BAD FRAME THAT YOU PUT UNDER THERE? NO WAY. THE CASE WORKER THAT SHE SPOKE TO WAS NOT HELPFUL WITH NO REGARD WHATSOEVER TO THE MONEY MY DAUGHTER HAD LOST ON THEIR WORTHLESS PRODUCT MUCH LESS HER SAFETY THAT WAS PUT AT RISK DRIVING THEIR PRODUCT WITH THE FAULTY FRAME THAT THEY USED.  MY FAMILY/FRIENDS WILL  NEVER BUY A TOYOTA PRODUCT AGAIN.   BOTTOM LINE: MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN DRIVING IN A VEHICLE THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF HER AND MY LOVED ONES. TOYOTA KNOWS THAT THE FRAMES OF THEIR 1994-2004 VEHICLES (800,000 OF THEM) ARE DEFECTIVE. YET, TOYOTA HAS NEVER RECALLED THESE VEHICLES. THEY SHOULD BE REPAIRED, BOUGHT BACK, OR REPLACED BY TOYOTA.

REPRESENTATIVES FROM TOYOTA HAVE TELEPHONED ME TWICE TO SAY THAT THEY WILL DO NOTHING. THE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES SAID THAT MY TRUCK \"DID NOT MEET THE PARAMETERS OF THEIR PROGRAM\".

SHE HAS THREE FORMS OF CANCER, AND WE DEPEND IN THIS VEHICLE. WHEN MY WIFE AND I PURCHASED THE TACOMA NEW  IN 2001, WE ALSO PURCHASED A $2,200 EXTRA PROTECTION PACKAGE.

THE RECALL WENT TO 2011. I WAS TOLD SINCE THE PREVIOUS OWNER DIDN'T ACT THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.   MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE FRAME BROKE BECAUSE OF A DEFECT I WAS UNAWARE OF AND UNABLE TO FIND OUT ABOUT. IT WAS NOT A SMALL FAILURE IT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC.

A TEN YEAR LIMIT SHOULD BE THE LIMIT ONLY IF THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY OF THERE FRAMES TO LAST THAT LONG. WHEN PURCHASING  A NEW OR USED TRUCK ONE WOULD NEVER ASSUME THE FRAME WOULD SNAP IN TEN YEARS.

THERE WAS A PRIOR RECALL/EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE FRAME AND I ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL.  I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IN 2013 FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER, WHO ADVISED ME THAT HE HAD BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO THE ORLEANS TOYOTA DEALERSHIP(IN ORLEANS, MA), DURING THE PREVIOUS RECALL/EXTENDED SERVICE PERIOD - IN MAY 2011 - WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED NOTICES, AND THAT HE WAS ADVISED THE FRAME WAS SOLID AND DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM.   ACCORDING TO TOYOTA'S RECORDS, ORLEANS TOYOTA DOCUMENTED THAT THE FRAME WAS CHECKED OUT AND PASSED THEIR INSPECTION.   NOW, ACCORDING TO [XXX].  AT TOYOTA NATIONAL CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPT., THE RECALL/EXTENDED SERVICE WARRANTY PROGRAM ON THE FRAME THEN EXPIRED LATER, IN SEPT., 2011.   NOW, HERE IS THE CATCH-22 THAT I AM CONFRONTED WITH ?? I HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY . [XXX] AND OTHERS, THAT AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION, IN MAY 2011, IF THE ORLEANS TOYOTA SERVICE DEPT. HAD PROVIDED A RUST PREVENTATIVE COATING TO THE FRAME, THEN THIS VEHICLE WOULD HAVE HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 15 YEARS ON IT.  AGAIN, THE PREVIOUS OWNER BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN AS INSTRUCTED WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER DOES NOT KNOW WHY HE WAS NOT OFFERED THE RUST PREVENTION COATING BACK IN 2011, AND WAS CONTENT THAT THE FRAME WAS SOLID, BECAUSE HE HAD BROUGHT IT IN TO ORLEANS TOYOTA, AND THEY HAD INSPECTED IT.  I UNDERSTAND THE NHTSA CURRENTLY HAS 134 OPEN COMPLAINTS JUST ON THIS YEAR 2001 TACOMAS WITH THIS PROBLEM.   I FEEL STRONGLY THAT TOYOTA SHOULD RECONSIDER AND FIX THE PROBLEM, SINCE FOR WHATEVER REASON, IT WAS TOYOTA 'S ERROR IN NOT APPLYING THE RUST PREVENTION COATING BACK IN 2011.  FOR TOYOTA NOW TO NOT STAND BEHIND THE VEHICLE BASED ON THEIR ERROR IS A POOR, AND DANGEROUS ACTION ON THEIR PART.  THANK YOU!

I INQUIRED TO THE SERVICE CONSULTANT AS TO WHY THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT BROUGHT ADDRESSED TO ME WHEN MY TRUCK WAS IN THERE A FEW MONTHS EARLIER FOR THE FRAME RUST PERFORATION RECALL. HE REPLIED THAT IF THEY NOTICE ANY ISSUES THEY PRESENT THE CUSTOMER WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AT THAT TIME THEY HAD THE ENTIRE CAB AND CHASSIS OFF TO INSTALL A BRAND NEW FRAME.

ALTHOUGH TOYOTA KNEW OF THE DEFECTIVE FRAMES PRIOR TO THE MARCH CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION, TOYOTA CHOSE NOT TO ALERT ME (OWNER OF A 2001 MODEL) OF THIS CONDITION.  ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008 AND NOVEMBER 19, 2008, TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND CORPORATE STAFF VERIFIED THE RUSTED FRAME AND NOTED THAT VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.    ALTHOUGH THIS FAILURE DIDN'T RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH, I AM CONCERNED OTHER 2001 OWNERS MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.  TOYOTA HAS DONE NOTHING TO ALERT 2001 OWNERS OF THIS SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT.  WE'RE FINDING OUT ONE AT A TIME AS OUR VEHICLES FAIL SAFETY INSPECTIONS.  BASED UPON MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE FRAME, I BELIEVE THE DEFECT IS NOT SIMPLY THE ABSENCE OF A CORROSION INHIBITING COATING, BUT RATHER INAPPROPRIATE METALLURGY - I.E. THE FRAME ITSELF COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED FROM THE CORRECT QUALITY OF STEEL FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE. *TR",

SEPTEMBER 6TH, 2008, WHILE INSTALLING AT A LOCAL TIRE AND BREAK SHOP, THE TECH NOTICED SERIOUS FRAME ROT ON THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE OF MY TRUCK. THE SHOP MANAGER INFORMED ME OF A VOLUNTARY TOYOTA BUY-BACK FOR 1999-2000 MODELS, WARRANTY POLICY BULLETIN POL08-03, DATED 3/7/08. I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND HAD THE TRUCK IMMEDIATELY INSPECTED BY LIA TOYOTA SERVICE OF COLONIE NY. I WAS INFORMED THE FRAME WAS SERIOUSLY ROTTED, AND THE TRUCK NO LONGER SAFE TO DRIVE.   I WAS TOLD THE FOLLOWING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION:  1. THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT 'GO TO BAT FOR ME' TO ASSIST ME WITH DEALING WITH TOYOTA FOR A RECALL REQUEST;  2. 2001 MODELS ARE NOT \"USUALLY COVERED\" IN THE RECALL. AND;   3. IF COVERED, I WOULD NOT GET A LOANER CAR; I WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE 150% VALUE AS IS STANDARD FOR 1995-2001 MODELS  THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE. WHY SHOULD THE 2001 MODELS BE EXCLUDED FROM THE WARRANTY AND RECALL COVERAGE AFFORDED BY THE 1995-2001 MODELS? MY TRUCK IS NEWER - YET IT HAS THE SAME FRAME ROT. THE FACT THAT THE DEALER REFUSED TO ASSIST ME WITH THIS PROCESS IS ADDITIONALLY INFURIATING.  TOYOTA HAS YET TO CONTACT ME VIA THE CASE MANAGER THEY HAVE ASSIGNED ME. I DON'T KNOW IF TOYOTA WILL PAY ME 100% OF THE VALUE OF MY TRUCK FOR MARCH OF 2008 OR AUGUST OF 2008. THE BLUE BOOK VALUE OF MY TRUCK HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE RECALL WAS ISSUED.   DEFECTIVE FRAMES ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THE 1995-2000 MODEL YEAR TACOMAS - SO WHY IS TOYOTA EXCLUDING NEWER MODELS? THIS IS DANGEROUS, PERHAPS EVEN CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT.  TOYOTA SHOULD BE RECALLING TACOMA TRUCKS MANUFACTURED AFTER 2000 THAT ARE EXPERIENCING MASSIVE FRAME RUST - WITHOUT DOING SO THE COMPANY IS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF TACOMA OWNERS. *TR  UPDATED 10/22/08*JB   UPDATED 02/24/10",

WE WERE TOLD BY TOYOTA THAT IT WOULD BE SENT THROUGH A CLAIMS PROCESS AND THEY WANTED US TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE FRAME LOOKED AT. AT THE APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP, THE TECH LOOKED AT THE FRAME AND SAID THAT A TOYOTA FIELD REPRESENTATIVE WOULD NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN DUE TO THE CONCERNS HE HAD. THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE CAME IN FROM CALIFORNIA AND LOOKED AT THE FRAME. HE TAPPED IT WITH A HAMMER IN A FEW PLACES AND IT WENT THROUGH. THEY TOLD US WE COULD NOT HAVE OUR TACOMA BACK AS IT WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION ANY MORE AND ARRANGED A RENTAL. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WOULD GET 150% OF THE RETAIL PRICE FOR BUY BACK BY ONE OF THE TOYOTA EMPLOYEES. WE WERE TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP BY THE REPRESENTATIVES TO KEEP QUIET AND NOT TELL ANYONE ELSE ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH OUR TACOMA, WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS ODD. A MONTH LATER, WE RECEIVE A PHONE CALL FROM TOYOTA SAYING THAT THEY WOULD GIVE US ONLY 12,000 DOLLARS FOR A TRUCK THAT BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS OF 150% OF RETAIL, THOUGH IT WAS THE 2001 MODEL YEAR, WAS WORTH OVER $19,700.

IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE HIT IN THE REAR END BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. YOU SOMTIMES HERE A SLIGHT THUD. THESE SYMPTOMS DO NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME BUT QUITE OFTEN.

I AM SENDING THIS TO VERIFY THAT INFORMATION AS MY DEALER STATE HE FELT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY TOY AFTER TAKING IT FOR A DRIVE WITH ME IN IT. PLEASE NOTE I POINTED IT OUT ONCE BUT HE SAID IT IS NORMAL. NORMAL IT IS NOT    SERVICE RESPONSE:    RUSS SWANSON:  WE MET AND WENT ON A ROAD TEST TOGETHER WHEN YOU WERE LAST HERE ON JULY 21.      OUR BEST INTEREST IS IN FINDING ANY ABNORMALITIES AND CORRECTING THEM.  IF THIS CONDITION WORSENS TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS AN ABNORMALITY, IT WILL BE OUR PLEASURE TO CORRECT IT.
