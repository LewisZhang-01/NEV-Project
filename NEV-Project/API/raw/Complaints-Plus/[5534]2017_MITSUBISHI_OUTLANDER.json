        "summary": "I am the owner of a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander.  On February 14, 2022 at 1:00 PM, my wife and I were driving home along the 405 freeway northbound from our son\u2019s house.  All of a sudden, we heard a loud bang and shattered glass entered the vehicle from overhead.  The majority of the sunroof glass spontaneously flew off with only remnants of shattered glass entering the vehicle.  Upon later inspection, I noticed that the glass was very fragile (easily breaks).  There were no warning messages and no prior  indication of problems with the glass sunroof.  The glass sunroof randomly broke without incident (i.e., no contact with any other vehicles).  The experience was tremendously jarring and unsettling because it was completely unexpected and could have caused me to lose control of the vehicle.  Fortunately, I was able to maintain control of the vehicle and avoided any accident.  We were a few car lengths away from any vehicles, both to the front of us and from behind and there were no foreign objects inside the vehicle that would indicate foul play.  Since we are both retired, the SUV is kept in the garage most of the time.  It only has 31,500 miles on it.  We are reporting this incident to let you know that it could happen again to other vehicles of the same model or manufacturer that could result in serious injuries.   I hope you\u2019ll look into this incident as soon as possible.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Please look at the quality of the glass and its proper installation.  I went to the Cerritos Mitsubishi dealership on the day of the incident (February 14, 2022) to show them the damage.",
