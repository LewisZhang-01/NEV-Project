I did engage my emergency flashers immediately but having the trucks side by side and the truck in my lane traveling at highway speeds I was almost struck from behind as the tractor trailer applied his brakes and was able to avoid the collision luckily.  I took my truck to the local dealership and was told what the issue was and I had it fixed immediately. The price of the repair was $10,362.64 give or take a few dollars. I had a warranty but that company refused to pay since it's not considered part of the engine.  Dodge has issued a Recall for the exact same part as far as I am understanding but yet Chevrolet/GMC has not.

When I got home and inspected I noticed my spare tire was not secure and corrosion in the rear of my frame.  I had the frame inspected by my dealership and it was confirmed the frame was defective, severely corroded in the mid and rear section.  The front was in almost new condition.  The stickers still intact.  They suggested I contact GM.  There were no warning lamps.  GM has committed to repairing the vehicle due to the wax coating defect. Now they are not cooperating due to no availability of frame.  I have not had a vehicle for almost 5 months.  Had I been driving at a high rate of speed when the frame broke or someone hit me there could have been an entirely different outcome as the frame has no integrity.  The truck would have crumpled.  There are many trucks left on the road with this HAZARDOUS issue.  Please see attached photos of well cared for truck and defective frame.",

THE ISSUE WAS MOTOR OIL REACHING THE #1 AND #7 CYLINDERS THUS FOULING THOSE TWO SPARK PLUGS.THE TRUCK WAS REPAIRED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. THE SAME SYMPTOMS APPEARED AGAIN IN AUGUST 2020 AND THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE SAME ISSUE (MIS-FIRE IN THE #7 CYLINDER) AS DESCRIBED IN THE TSB. SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, GM WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIR. I CHOSE TO DEAL WITH THE SYMPTOMS MYSELF WHICH INVOLVED INSTALLING NEW SPARK PLUGS IN THE TWO CYLINDERS. IN MID-MARCH OF THIS YEAR (2021), THE SYMPTOMS APPEARED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE #1 AND #7 SPARK PLUGS WERE FOULED WITH MOTOR OIL. IN EACH CASE, THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN THE SYMPTOMS PRESENTED. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT STABILITRAK IS DESIGNED TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTS BY GIVING THE DRIVER BETTER CONTROL OF THE SILVERADO.

AFTER A VISIT TO MY USUAL SERVICE GARAGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY A CERTIFIED DEALER., THE PROBLEM WAS ACKNOWLEDGED. I CALLED CHEVROLET USA AND OPENED A FILE BASED ON MY INFORMATION. AT ONE POINT MY TRUCK COMPUTER WARNED TO PULL OVER AND NOT DRIVE ANY FURTHER DUE TO LOW OIL. UPON INSPECTION THERE WAS NO EXTERNAL REASON FOR THE FACT THAT THE OIL WAS LOW. THE VEHICLE HAS REGULAR OIL CHANGES WITH MOBIL 1 SYNTHETIC. AFTER CHECKING CHEVROLET  5.3 LITER ENGINE ISSUES I FOUND THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED REGARDING THE SAME ISSUE AS MINE. THE SUIT DID NOT GO ANYWHERE BUT THE ISSUE SEEMS TO BE THE SAME THAT MY TRUCK IS EXPERIENCING. IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANY LONGER BUT HAD ONLY 71,453 MILES  AT THE TIME OF ISSUE RECOGNITION. CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE BASICALLY DISMISSED MY COMPLAINT SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO BECAUSE THERE'S NO RECALL OR GM BULLETIN. THE DEALER SOLUTION IS A PISTON AND RING REPLACEMENT FOR $ 6,999.95 WHICH IS BASICALLY AN ENGINE REBUILD (BUT NOT A COMPLETE ONE). IN  ADDITION, THEY WILL INSTALL WHAT WAS REFERRED TO AS A BALLAST WHICH WOULD SOLVE THE CONSUMPTION ISSUE SUPPOSEDLY. IF THIS IS TRUE THEN I ASSUME THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT ISSUE. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO CHECK YOUR OIL EVERY 1000 MILES AND IF YOU ARE LOW THEN ADD IT. NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE WITH A VEHICLE THAT COST OVER $40,000 WITH 71,000 PLUS MILES. I AM REGISTERING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I AM FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED. THIS I AM SURE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH. THANK YOU.",

ON 16 MAY, 2015, I CALLED MARINE CHEVROLET'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT A 1 1/2\"CRACK ABOVE THE CENTER OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG. MY TRUCK HAD 37,017 MILES AND WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE ORIGINAL FACTORY WARRANTY. HOWEVER, I WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS WAS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL. THE DEALERSHIP SCHEDULE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT FOR 8:30 AM ON 18 MAY, 2015. AFTER CONDUCTING RESEARCH OVER THE WEEKEND, I LEARNED THAT OTHER CHEVY AND GMC OWNERS OF TRUCK AND SUV MODELS BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013 REPORTED CRACKED DASHES NEAR THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS. ON 18 MAY, I BROUGHT MY TRUCK TO MARINE CHEVROLET'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE THE CRACK. THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE INITIALLY TOLD ME THAT SINCE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, CHEVROLET WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS. I EXPLAINED THAT THE CRACK HAPPENED LESS THAN THREE YEARS AFTER I PURCHASED THE TRUCK AND I WAS AWARE OF THE HISTORY OF THESE DASHBOARDS. THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TALKED TO HIS SERVICE MANAGER AND LATER TOLD ME THAT GM WOULD PAY THE MAJORITY OF THE MAINTENANCE COST AND THAT I WOULD ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR $100. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ONLINE COMPLAINTS I HAVE SEEN IN FORUMS AND ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES, I FEEL GM MAY HAVE INSTALLED DEFECTIVE DASHBOARDS IN 2007 - 2013 TRUCK AND SUV MODELS AND PASSED THE COST OF DEFECTIVE PARTS ONTO THE CUSTOMER. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYS WITH A CRACK DASHBOARD SURROUNDING IT, THERE COULD AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF DASHBOARD SHRAPNEL FLYING INTO A PASSENGER'S FACE. I THINK NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE CRACKING DASHBOARD ISSUE IN GM'S SUVS AND PICK-UP TRUCKS FROM 2007 - 2013 AND INFLUENCE GM TO ISSUE A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.",

JUNE, 2013 - A TROPICAL STORM SWEPT THROUGH THE AREA, DUMPING TONS OF RAIN; CAUSING THE HUMIDITY TO RISE A FEW HOURS LATER AS WELL AS CAUSING EVERYTHING TO BE MOIST/WET.  BOTH EVENTS WERE EITHER IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OR IN THE EVENING AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN, AND INVOLVE WETNESS/MOISTURE, HUMIDITY, AND THE INABILITY TO \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD.  PROBLEM:  THERE IS A \"CONDENSATION FILM\" THAT FORMS ON THE WINDSHIELD DUE TO THE OUTSIDE ELEMENTS BEING MORE MOIST AND HUMID THAN THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  USUALLY, WHEN TURNING ON THE DEFROSTER, THIS WILL \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD AND MAKE THE CONDENSATION FILM GO AWAY.  HOWEVER, THE DEFROSTER ON THIS MODEL DOES NOT \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD ON THE RIGHT SIDE (PASSENGER) OF THE VEHICLE.  THE AIR COMING OUT OF THE DEFROSTER ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS NOT AS STRONG AS THE LEFT. THERE IS A CONSTANT  CONDENSATION FILM THAT FORMS AND REMAINS.  THE WIPERS WILL CLEAR THE WETNESS/MOISTURE AWAY, TEMPORARILY, BUT THE FILM REMAINS AND THE MOISTURE/WETNESS RETURNS.  THIS MAKES THE VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRUCK NON-EXISTENT, AND WHEN TURNING A RIGHT HAND CORNER, OR ENTERING AN INTERSECTION, YOU CAN NOT SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  THIS IS A LIABILITY AND ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.......  CONFIRMATION/MANUFACTURER KNOWLEDGE:  I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER - TWICE - AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS \"NORMAL\" FOR THIS MODEL.  I CONTACTED THE GM HOTLINE, WHO ESCALATED THE CLAIM TO THE ENGINEERING CLAIMS DEPARTMENT AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM, THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF IT, AND TOLD THE DEALER NOT TO DO ANY REPAIRS AT THIS TIME.
