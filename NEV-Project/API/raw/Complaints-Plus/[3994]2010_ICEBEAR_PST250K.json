AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 30 & 45MPH IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ON THE ROADWAY. AT SPEEDS ABOVE 45MPH, THE VEHICLE WILL RUN OFF THE ROADWAY EITHER INTO ANOTHER LANE OF TRAFFIC OR ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.    THE STEERING SEEMS TWITCHY AND EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO OPERATOR INPUT. ON PERFECTLY SMOOTH PAVEMENT, IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT LINE OF TRAVEL FOR ANY DISTANCE. IT SEEMS TO WANT TO WANDER OR VEER.  *TR",
