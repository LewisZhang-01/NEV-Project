So one thing I have to say is, the vehicle has great pick up. I called 911 and went after him to get his lic plate. When I got to be about 10 car lengths or so, he slammed his brakes. Since I was on the left lane, I could not keep going left and risk going into oncoming traffic. Plus, there was a car on the right lane I slammed the brakes and rear ended him on his right rear. He had a 2021 Toyota Tacoma pick up and our hood flipped up and shattered the windshield. The hood stayed up and I was driving blind. All I did was keeping straight, not knowing where I was going and didn\u2019t hit a vehicle, tree, embankment or sign. I went there yesterday and I have no idea how I we didn\u2019t die. I\u2019m so shaken up by it. When we came to a stop, there was a hole about 6 feet from my front tire. We were the victim of road rage and this person caused the accident purposely. He admitted it to the police. He said to the cop, I was slowing down traffic. I suspect with the size of his vehicle and being so close to my rear bumper, he did not see my turn signal.

It has caused me to take my attention off the road trying to get the system to reconnect so I do not miss an exit or turn. Many others with the same make/model vehicle are complaining of this same defect on the internet. Today it happened 20-30 times on a 3hr trip. Most times it reconnects on its own after a some time. Sometimes I have to manually hard reboot the infotainment system to get it back. I have been to the dealer and have called Hyundai care. No one seems to know what the issue is. They just kind of give me the runaround. The dealer admitted there is a problem but had no solution. Carplay is supposed to make driving safer by putting your phone GPS etc on the car screen for safe hands free operation. These disconnects are going to get someone killed.",

When I stop at the traffic light while driving and start, the car will turn off and I have to take off my car key and wait in 30 seconds and turn on the car again. Nowadays, The brakes were not applied because the engine was turned off while driving. At that time, my driving speed was around 15mph because I exited from a HWY.

This is ridiculous and should be UNACCEPTABLE.  There's absolutely no reason turn signals and reverse lamps can't be mounted where the stop and tail lamps are mounted. It's nearly impossible to see turn signals on the bumper. PLEASE CONSIDER A HEIGHT MANDATE FOR REAR TURN SIGNALS AND REVERSE LAMPS. And, if possible, also consider a mandate for *bright* side repeater signals, amber rear signals, and a height requirement for front signals as well. It's about time that North America joined the rest of the world in these mandates. Thank you!!!",

With horns blaring I managed to coast to the right blocking traffic leaving one lane open for moving traffic.  Vehicle after a couple of tries would start but would not move when gear was placed in Drive or Reverse.  Hyundai Roadside Assistance notified vehicle towed to closest Hyundai Dealership.  This was dangerous vehicles were almost running into the back of my SUV while abruptly stopping. I exited the vehicle while waiting for the tow truck in fear of vehicle being hit placing myself and others at risk of an accident. Informed by Asst. Service Manager at Hyundai Dealership that no one was trained to work on the 2022 TUCSONs at the Dealership.  As a Public Safety measure at least some employees at each dealership should be trained to work on all newly released vehicles before they are placed on the market.   Notified on June 15, 2021 that the vehicle has a limp mode/ limp node problem.  June 16, 2021 I was informed by Hyundai dealership that the 22 TUCSON has a mechanical defect, transmission fluid was leaking which now the Transmission needs to be replaced.  The newly purchased vehicle currently has only around 370 miles on it.  I thought vehicles go through an inspection before leaving factory and after they reach the dealership before being sold.  This I consider to be another safety issue anything can happen during transport.  A repurchase/buyback from Hyundai wasn't approved.  The vehicle is available for inspection upon request.  Vehicle is ready and will be picked up from the dealership  requesting an invoice of the repair work completed for viewing.  This vehicle could have caused a catastrophic deadly occurrence",
