WHILE DRIVING HEARD A LOUD POPPING NOISE, FOLLOWED BY CONTINUOUS POPPING LOUD POPPING NOISE LIKE A BROKEN EXHAUST MUFFLER, SOUNDED LIKE A MOTORCYCLE. AFTER INVESTIGATING, FOUND OUT THAT THE #3 SPARK PLUG POPPED OUT (EJECTED) OF THE HEAD CYLINDER, BROKE THE SPARK IGNITION COIL. WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I SMELLED FUEL, AND SAW SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD, SO I DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR AND TOWED THE CAR HOME. I HAD TO REPLACE THE IGNITION COIL AND SPARK PLUG AND REINSTALLED THE SPARK PLUG BUT IT SEEMED TO BE STILL LOOSE, SO I TOOK IT OUT AND PUT THREAD LOCK AND REINSTALLED IT BUT DID NOT TIGHTEN IT TO THE MAX AND DID NOT START THE CAR TILL AFTER 24 HOURS SO THE THREAD LOCK WILL HOLD IT IN PLACE. YESTERDAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO #8 SPARK PLUG, IT ALSO BROKE THE COIL, AND WHEN I TRIED TO INSTALL THE NEW SPARK PLUG, FOUND OUT THAT THE THREADS ON THE HEAD CYLINDER WILL NOT GRAB THE SPARK PLUG, AND NOW I AM STUCK WITHOUT A CAR. WHEN I ASKED AROUND, PEOPLE SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THE FORD EXPEDTION. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND COULD KILL SOMEONE IF THE ENGINE CAUGHT ON FIRE, BECAUSE I SMELLED GAS AND SMOKE. IF THIS IS A COMMON DANGEROUS PROBLEM ON THE FORD EXPEDTION, HOW COME THERE IS NO RECALL FOR IT???? ARE WE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO DIE DUE TO ENGINE / VEHICLE FIRE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE ASAP AND LET FORD FIX THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM. SPARK PLUGS EJECTING OUT LIKE THIS? I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE ONLY 4 THREADS ON THE HEAD CYLINDER HOLDING THE PARK PLUG, BUT THE SPARK PLUG HAS 10 OR 11 THREADS AND OFCOURSE ONLY 4 OF THOSE THREADS ARE BEING HELD BY THE HEAD CYLINDER. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM WAITING TO HURT OR KILL SOMEONE, PLEASE ASK FORD TO FIX THIS BIG PROBLEM, THANK YOU....",

Replacing the fuse/relay will correct, but for a time. Panel replacement is required. First incident at 165k. Second incident at about 205k.  After the last panel replacement, the vehicle continued to stall. Another faulty fuse, for the day running lamps, caused a fault, which melted the housing between the panel and the wiring harness. The screw attachment is \"crunchy\" because of the melted elements. The smell is noticeable, and the panel requires replacement again. Third incident about 246k.  This is a fire hazard. The wiring harness is hot to the touch.   Being a KNOWN issue, having discussed on various socials and with ford dealer techs, this should have been recalled ages ago.",

ONCE IT DIED, SO DID THE POWER STEERING AND BRAKES - VERY SCARY.  THERE WERE NO ENGINE CODES THAT CAME UP AND NO INDICATION ANYTHING WAS WRONG, THE ENGINE WOULD SIMPLY SHUT OFF.  WHILE DIAGNOSING THE ISSUE I DID SOME INTERNET RESEARCH THAT INDICATED IT COULD BE THE FUEL PUMP RELAY ISSUE.  THE FUEL PUMP RELAY IS A NON-SERVICEABLE RELAY THAT IS SOLDERED TO THE MAIN FUSE BOX CIRCUIT BOARD.  I REMOVED THE FUSE BOX AND DISASSEMBLED IT REVEALING THE FUEL PUMP RELAY WAS GETTING HOT AND HAD MELTED THE SOLDER ON THE BOARD.  WHEN THE RELAY COOLED, THE SOLDER MADE CONTACT AND THE ENGINE WOULD START RIGHT UP.  WHEN DRIVING THE SOLDER WOULD WARM UP AND BREAK CONTACT.  THIS WOULD SHUT THE FUEL PUMP OFF AND THE ENGINE WOULD DIE.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF THIS ALL OVER THE INTERNET.   THE ONLY REPAIR FOR THIS ITEM WAS TO REPLACE THE MAIN CIRCUIT BOARD AS THE RELAY CANNOT BE REPLACED WITHOUT SOLDERING TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD.  ONCE THE FUSE BOX WAS REPLACED, THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.

ONCE I STARTED TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE, I LOOKED AT THE FRONT TIRES AND THEY ARE SEVERELY WARPED!!  I'M NOT AN AUTOMOBILE AFICIONADO, BUT MY FRONT TIRES (BOTH) ARE COMPLETELY BALD ON THE OUTER PORTION OF THE TIRES, WHILE THE INNER THREADS ON THE TIRES SHOW LITTLE WEAR (THE TIRES ARE ONLY 2 YEARS OLD).  FROM WHAT I HAVE GATHERED, THE \"CUPPING\" THE TIRES EXPERIENCED ARE FROM A FAULTY/DEFECTIVE FRONT END ALIGNMENT.  I NOTICED SHORTLY INTO MY TRIP, THAT MY STEERING WHEEL HAD A MODERATE VIBRATION.  I HAVE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHEN I USED TO OWN A 1997 FORD EXPLORER (IT ALWAYS NEED A FRONT END ALIGNMENT/ADJUSTMENT).  I WAS NOT TICKETED FOR THE INCIDENT AND AM COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FAULTY FRONT END ALIGNMENT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE STEERING VIBRATION, AND THE WHEELS CUPPING, RESULTING IN UNEVEN TREAD-WEAR, LEADING TO MY HYDROPLANING ACCIDENT...  *TR",

THE CAR HAD LAST BEEN USED THE PRIOR NIGHT AT 8PM, WHEN WE RETURNED FROM EATING DINNER, AND HAD REMAINED IDLE SINCE THAT TIME.   UPON HEARING OUR STORY, SEVERAL FRIENDS MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD READ STORIES ABOUT FORD VEHICLES THAT HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH CAUSING FIRES, EVEN IN VEHICLES THAT HAD REMAINED IDLE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  I CHECKED AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR THERE WERE ANY RECALLS FOR MY VEHICLE'S YEAR, BUT HAD BEEN FOR THE PRIOR YEAR'S (2002).

THE DAMAGE INSPECTOR FOR OUR INSURANCE COMPANY STATED IT WAS LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COVER OUR FULL LIEN AMOUNT AND I BELIEVE AT THE VERY LEAST FORD SHOULD MAKE WHOLE FOR US.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH FORD ABOUT POSSIBLE SUBROGATION, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT IN TIME IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL ASK FOR DOLLARS BEYOND WHAT THEY WOULD PAY OUT IN THE LOSS.    WE WERE FORTUNATE IT DID NOT SPREAD TO OUR HOME, MY HUSBAND'S FORD PARKED NEXT TO IT OR TO OUR BOAT WHICH WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT.  IT WAS VERY, VERY CLOSE AND COULD HAVE EASILY HAPPENED.

WE EVEN THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE SHOT AT OUR VEHICLE, THEN WE REALIZED THE AIRBAGS HAD DEPLOYED.  FORTUNATELY, NEITHER OF US WERE SITTING WITH OUR HEADS OR ARMS NEAR THE WINDOWS TO BE INJURED BY THE DEPLOYMENT.  WE CONTACTED OUR INSURANCE COMPANY, HOWEVER THEY TOLD US THAT SINCE THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT THEY COULD DO NOTHING FOR US.  WE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER THE NEXT DAY.  THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING, SO WE SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR THEM TO LOOK AT OUR VEHICLE.  THEY CALLED A REPRESENTATIVE FROM FORD TO COME AND INSPECT IT.  BASED ON THE READING BY THE \"COMPUTER\", IT INDICATED THAT OUR VEHICLE HAD ENCOUNTERED AN \"IMPENDING ROLL-OVER\".

IT WAS 113 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND WASN'T GOING TO STICK MY HAND IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND GET BURNED. LUCKILY I WAS NOT FAR FROM MY HOUSE, SO I LIMPED VERY CAUTIOUSLY TO MY HOME. I PROCEEDED TO POP THE HOOD AGAIN FOR A MORE DETAILED INSPECTION AND WITH A FLASHLIGHT I COULD SEE SPARKS FIRING ON THE TOP OF THE ENGINE BLOCK. LOOKED CLOSER AND THERE WAS A HOLE NEXT TO WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LONG RUBBER TUBE. GRABBED MY TOOLS AND REMOVED THE ENGINE SHROUD TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND THAT'S WHEN I FIGURED IT OUT. THERE WAS NO SPARK PLUG IN THE HOLE, I THOUGHT MAYBE FORD HAS SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THIS VEHICLE DOESN'T USE SPARK PLUGS JUST COILS OF SOME SORT. THE COIL HOUSINGS PLASTIC NUB WAS BROKEN OFF. O.K. THAT WOULD BE AN EASY FIX, CLOSE TO 8PM GETTING DARK, SO I JUMP INTO MY WIFE CARE AND DRIVE THE PARTS STORE UP THE STREET. ASK THE MANAGER THAT WAS THERE FOR THE PART AND HE ASKED IF THE SPARK PLUG WAS STILL IN THE HOLE FULLY ATTACHED.

I HAVE MADE PHONE CALLS TO NO AVAIL--FORD CISTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER OR REPUTABLE SERVICE CENTER. THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY AT ALL!! SO I AM GOING FURTHER WITH THIS BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO GET IT FIXED--(A) IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AND (B) A FIRE COULD START, AND (C) VERY EXPENSIVE TO GET FIXED. WE HAVE READ MANY OTHER CONSUMERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM BUT FORDS DOES'NT WANT TO HELP OUT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WORSE SCENARIOS HAPPEN WITH POSSIBLE DEATHS.

GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE DAMAGED COIL INSULATION WAS NOW ARCING ITS SPARK ACROSS THE ENGINE HEAD AND THAT THE FUEL MIXTURE WAS SPEWING OUT OF THE SPARK PLUG HOLE IT'S SURPRISING THAT WE AVOIDED AN ENGINE FIRE UNDER THE PLASTIC SHROUD.

THEY EXAMINED ALL THE SPARK PLUG THREADS AND ADVISED THAT THEY APPEARED OK, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS ONE CYLINDER.  TO EFFECT REPAIRS THEY ADVISED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO ANOTHER OUTLET 36 MILES ($104 CHARGE) UP THE ROAD.  THEY FURTHER ADVISED THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 5.4 ENGINE AND THAT THIS MAY OCCUR IN OTHER CYLINDERS IN THE FUTURE.  FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE (800#) DISCLAIMS ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BEING A COMMON PROBLEM AND REFERRED ME TO THE LOCAL DEALER FOR TECHNICAL ADVICE.  AT THE LOCAL DEALER, THE MECHANIC WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE, PRONOUNCED IT RATHER COMMON AND ADVISED THAT FORD WOULD BE HAPPY TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER HIS ESTIMATE WOULD COST ME MORE THAN TWICE THE ESTIMATED FEE FROM THE INDEPENDENT (INCLUSIVE OF THE ADDITIONAL TOW COSTS).

THE REPAIR WAS AROUND $650 FOR A \"NOT FOR SURE\" FIX. APPARENTLY THE THREADS THAT HOLD THE SPARKPLUGS IN HAD STRIPPED, CAUSING THE BLOWOUT OF THE SPARKPLUG. I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC AT OUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP THAT THE PERMANENT FIX WOULD REQUIRE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HEADS AT AROUND $4000. I OPTED FOR THE CHEAP FIX BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FINANCING FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE REPAIR.   I DID A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHER CONSUMERS WHO HAD PURCHASED FOR SUV'S AND TRUCKS WITH SAME MODEL ENGINES WERE REPORTING THE SAME PROBLEM IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS, MANY WITH MULTIPLE BLOWOUTS AT VARIOUS INCIDENCES. I WAS HOPING MY PROBLEM WAS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE CYLINDER BUT AT AROUND 90,000, 5 1/2 MONTHS LATER, ANOTHER SPARKPLUG BLEW OUT. NOW THE REPAIR WAS EVEN MORE DUE TO A NEW PART THAT IS TO PROVIDE A MORE PERMANENT FIX. THIS TIME THE REPAIR WAS $830.  KNOWING THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH THESE MODEL ENGINE I ASKED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER'S SERVICE MAN \"IF FORD KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM, WHY DON'T THEY FIX IT\"? HIS REPLY WAS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT A DANGER SO NO RECALL HAS EVER BEEN CALLED. THE GUY WENT AS FAR AS TELLING ME THAT THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY IMPROPER THREADING INTO THE HEAD. THE THREADS WERE MACHINED TO SHALLOW AND EVENTUALLY THEY BECOME LOOSE AND FINALLY BLOWOUT WHEN THE THREAD COMPLETELY FAIL.   I THINK IF YOU INVESTIGATE THIS FURTHER YOU WILL SEE THAT IN MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE THE EJECTING SPARKPLUG HAS SEVERED GAS LINES AND CAUSED FIRES. NOT EXACTLY WHAT I CONSIDER TO \"NOT BE A DANGER\".   FORD ADMITS NON FAULT ON THEIR PART EVEN KNOW THEY KNOW THEY HAVE SOLD A FAULTY PRODUCT IN MASS NUMBERS TO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES. *TR",

WHILE DRIVING ON INTERSTATE I-90 NEAR BOSTON, MA, THE ENGINE EJECTED A SPARK PLUG FROM THE HEAD CASING OF MY MOTOR (THIRD PLUG ON THE PASSENGER SIDE).  WHEN THE PLUG EJECTED, IT TOOK WITH IT ALL OF THE THREADS IN THE CASING, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE HEAD.  THIS HAPPENED VERY SUDDENLY, AND RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN VEHICLE PERFORMANCE - WHICH NEARLY CAUSED A VEHICLE CRASH ON THE HIGHWAY.  I WAS STRANDED ON THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE FOR SOME TIME AND HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED.  MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, MY MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE 4TH EXPEDITION HE HAD SEEN THIS YEAR WITH THIS DAMAGE TO THE EXACT SAME PLUG CASING - IN HIS MIND CLEARLY A DEFECT GIVEN THAT THESE WERE ALL RELATIVELY NEW VEHICLES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MILEAGE ON THEM.  I CALLED FORD ON THIS - BUT THEY CLAIMED THIS WAS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM (I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM).  MY REPAIR COSTS FOR THIS WERE OVER $2,000.  SUBSEQUENT REVIEW OF YOUR WEBSITE INDICATES THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN CALIFORNIA CLAIMING TO HAVE INCURRED THE SAME TYPE OF DAMAGE.  IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THIS IS ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY SUBMIT THIS REQUEST THAT THIS BE LOOKED INTO ON MY BEHALF AS WELL AS FOR OTHERS WHO I'M SURE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ALREADY - BUT ARE NOT AWARE THAT THIS MAY BE A WIDESPREAD DEFECT/SAFETY ISSUE.  *JB",

I HAD REPORTED TO FORD THAT THE BRAKES BEGAN SQUEAKING THAT MORNING AND CONTINUED TO SQUEAK FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AFTER THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS RELEASED.

WHEN THE ASPEN TIRE AND AUTO SERVICE TECHNICIANS EXAMINED THE BRAKE SYSTEM, THEY REPORTED TO ME THAT BOTH ROTORS WERE UNEVENLY WORN AND WARPED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE LEFT CALIPER WAS NOT RELEASING PROPERLY.  I WAS IN THE VICINITY AND WAS ABLE TO INSPECT THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM IN THEIR SERVICE CENTER.       THE ASPEN TIRE AND AUTO CENTER BROUGHT THE RIGHT ROTOR TO MINIMUM SAFETY SPECIFICATIONS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO SALVAGE THE LEFT ROTOR.  THEIR TECHNICIANS CLEANED THE BRAKE SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWED BOTH CALIPERS TO PERFORM NORMALLY.  BOTH ROTORS HAD TO BE REPLACED.

THE FOLLOWING IS A COPY OF AN EMAIL THAT I SENT TO THE CONTINENTAL CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I THINK THAT HAS ALL OF THE INFORMATION YOU WILL NEED TO START LOOKING INTO THIS PROBLEM.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS SINCE I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.  YOU HAVE A LENGTH OF ONLY 2000 WORDS AND MY MESSAGE TO THEM IS TOO LONG SO PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR THE REST OF THE MESSAGE.       DEAR RASHIDA, (OR WHOMEVER ELSE SEES THIS MESSAGE)      I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND CONCERN THIS MORNING.  I HAVE SOME INTERESTING NEWS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE ASTOUNDING AND WILL WARRANT SOME MAJOR ATTENTION FROM THE POWERS THAT BE.  NOT ONLY IS THE DAMAGE TO MY TIRES A MANUFACTURER DEFECT BUT THE DAMAGE IS IN ALL OF MY TIRES, INCLUDING ONE THAT WAS REPLACED ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.  THE OTHER ORIGINAL THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED MAY HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM SINCE IT HAD A GASH IN THE SIDE THAT CAUSED IT TO GO FLAT.     AFTER TALKING WITH YOU I HAPPENED TO MENTION MY PROBLEM TO A NEIGHBOR WHO ASKED ME TO HAVE HER HUSBAND LOOK AT IT.  AS IT TURNS OUT HE HAD BEEN A PLANT SUPERVISOR FOR KELLEY-SPRINGFIELD TIRES BEFORE MOVING UP TO THIS AREA.  HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT TIRE MANUFACTURING AND TESTING.  HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT MY TIRE AND SAID \"THERE IS NO WAY THAT WAS CAUSED BY A RAZOR, THAT IS A DEFECT AND IT IS BAD NEWS.\"  HE TOLD ME TO LET WHOMEVER I TALKED TO KNOW THAT THE TIRE IS SEPARATING \"WHERE THE APEX MEETS THE SIDEWALL.\"  HE WENT INTO A BIT MORE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION BUT I AM NOT AN EXPERT SO I CAN'T ACCURATELY RELAY WHAT HE SAID.  HE SAID IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND HE BETS THAT A MAJOR RECALL WILL BE OCCURRING, HOPEFULLY BEFORE ANYTHING TRAGIC OCCURS.  HE IS NOT AN OVERLY EXCITABLE MAN BUT HE PROBABLY TOLD ME ABOUT 10 TIMES TO GET THE TIRES OFF OF MY CAR.*AK",
