WHEN CAMPING AND USING THE FRESH WATER FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, THE USED WATER IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  THE FAILURE CAUSED THE TRAILER TO BECOME UNBALANCED AND TO SWAY WHILE DRIVING.  RECALL # 07V060000 (TRAILER HITCHES) WAS FOUND.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE REMEDY FOR THIS FAILURE IS TO ADD MORE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE TRAILER IS FULLY LOADED, TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE HITCH WILL CAUSE IT TO FAIL.  THE CONTACT CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, BUT THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED.  NO OTHER VEHICLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.",
