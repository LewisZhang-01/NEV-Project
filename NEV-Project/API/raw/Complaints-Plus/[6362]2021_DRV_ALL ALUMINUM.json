        "summary": "I heard a scraping noise coming from the passenger right front axle. I jacked up the camper and the right front wheel would spin forward but not backwards. It made a scraping or grinding noise when spinning the tire. We called a mobile technician and he first discovered that the caliper brackets were bent allowing the caliper to move around and had lightly scraped the inside of the aluminum wheel. Second thing the mobile technician discovered was the rotor was not bolted tight to the hub assembly. He found that several bolts were missing and the ones that were left were all loose. His comment was we would not have made it to our next destination. He said if we hadn't noticed this and the brake rotor came completely loose that the consequences would have been catastrophic. He used a thread chaser on the hub and installed new bolts.",
