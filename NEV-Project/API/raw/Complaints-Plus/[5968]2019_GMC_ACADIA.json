Now at 98000 miles, shifting harder (automatic) like a jolt and vibrates going up hill- told I needed transmission fluid changed, this did nothing.  This was confirmed by dealership prior to fluid change and then the dealership would not set up another appointment.  Had this confirmed also by an independent service center.

THE FIRST TIME I HAD A PROBLEM I HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE TRUCK TO RUN INTO A STORE. WHEN I TRIED TO START IT I WAS GETTING A MESSAGE TO SHIFT TO PARK. THE ELECTRIC WAS ON, BUT THE TRUCK WOULD NOT START. I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK. THE TOW DRIVER GOT THE TRUCK STARTED AND ADVISED ME TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER LESS THAN 1 MILE AWAY. WHILE DRIVING ON A MAJOR ROAD I LOST MY POWER STEERING AND STABILTRAK, MAKING IT FEEL LIKE I LOST MY BRAKES. MY EXPERIENCE AT THE DEALER WAS HORRIBLE. THEY CHANGED MY BATTERY AND SAID THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM. I DID NOT EVEN MAKE IT 24 HOURS BEFORE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. THE ELECTRIC WAS ON BUT THE TRUCK WAS NOT RUNNING. I WAS GETTING A MESSAGE TO SHIFT TO PARK. THE TRUCK WAS OFF AND PARKED BUT THE DASHBOARD WAS SHOWING D THEN P AGAIN. I CALLED FOR ANOTHER TOW, AND THIS TIME IT WAS ACTUALLY TOWED. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD IT HAD TO DO WITH THE COMPUTER. SERVICE FIXED IT AND HELD ONTO THE TRUCK FOR A FEW DAYS TO MAKE SURE IT CONTINUED WORKING WITHOUT PROBLEMS. 6 DAYS LATER THEY CALLED ME TO PICK IT UP AND IT DIDN'T EVEN MAKE 5 HOURS THIS TIME. THE TRUCK WAS STILL RUNNING THIS TIME, BUT THE ELECTRIC WAS GOING CRAZY. EVERY LIGHT WAS LIT ON THE DASHBOARD. AS I WAS DRIVING IT TO THE DEALER, THE SPEEDOMETER WAS GOING CRAZY. I WAS DRIVING STEADY AT AROUND 35 MPH AND THE SPEEDOMETER WAS SHOWING 1, 0, 5, 0, 30, 31, 6, 0, 5, 31, 32, 1, 0, 5, 0. (I HAVE A VIDEO OF THIS BUT CANNOT ATTACH IT).SO THAT WAS 55 DAYS AGO AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY TRUCK BACK BECAUSE GM IS SUPPOSEDLY BUYING IT BACK.

THE SHIFTER FAILURE WAS FIRST NOTICED WHEN THE CAR HAD ABOUT 500 MILES ON IT, COMING DOWN A MOUNTAIN ON A HIGHWAY WHEN WE TRIED TO USE THE ENGINE TO BRAKE INSTEAD OF USING THE FOOT BRAKE ON MARCH 30, 2019.  IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DATES ON MARCH 21, 2019, THE CAR HAD A WATER LEAK AFTER IT RAINED THAT DRIPPED INTO THE CABIN OF THE CAR AND DIRECTLY ONTO THE SHIFTER AND OTHER ELECTRONIC CONTROLS. I BELIEVE THE GEAR SHIFTER FAILURE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF WATER DRIPPING ONTO THE SHIFTER AND OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE CENTER CONSOLE.  I HAVE 3 DOCUMENTED SERVICE RECORDS ATTEMPTING TO REPAIR THE WATER LEAK AFTER 3 SEPARATE RAINSTORMS THAT WAS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY GM ENGINEERING TO BE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  WHEN THE GLASS IS POSITIONED FOR THE REAR MOONROOF, THE POSITIONER IS SUPPOSED TO HOLD THE GLASS IN PLACE FOR A MOMENT TO SEAL.  INSTEAD THE POSITIONER MOVES CREATING AN AIR POCKET.

I AM WORRIED ABOUT WHERE ELSE WATER HAS TRAVELLED WITHIN THE CAR, KNOWING IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN JULY 2018 AND STORED OUTSIDE MOST OF ITS LIFE.
