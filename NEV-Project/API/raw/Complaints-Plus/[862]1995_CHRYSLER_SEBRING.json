THE LID IS VERY HEAVY AND CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS INJURY TO ANY PERSON REACHING UNDER IT TO REMOVE LUGGAGE, THE SPARE TIRE, ETC.. THIS IS MY DAUGHTER VALERIE'S FIRST CAR. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED SHE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SNAPPED THE MECHANISM BACK IN PLACE. IT CAME OFF AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS. ON 5/16/1999 I FOUND OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS STILL THERE AND TOLD MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER. THEY WENT TO MILTON RUBEN CHEVROLET ON 5/19/1999 WITH THE CAR AND SHOWED THE PROBLEM TO MR. CAL REUBER - MANAGER AT THE BODY SHOP DEPARTMENT.  HE EXAMINED THE TRUNK AND TOLD US THAT THE MECHANISM WAS WORN OUT AND THAT NEW PARTS HAD TO BE ORDERED. HE INSRUCTED MY WIFE TO GO TO THE FRONT OFFICE. A LADY NAMED MICHELLE CAME OUTSIDE AND WROTE DOWN THE SERIAL NUMBER, THE MODEL, COLOR, ETC.. SHE ALSO WROTE DOWN MY DAUGHTER'S NAME AND TELEPHONE NUMBER. SHE SAID THAT THE SHE WOULD CALL WITHIN A WEEK. SHE NEVER DID. TODAY, I TOLD MY DAUGHTER TO CALL AND THEY SEEM NOT TO HAVE ANY INFORMATION. AGAIN SHE SAID SHE WOULD CALL BACK. NEVER DID. I TOLD MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER TO GO TO THE DEALER PERSONNALLY. THERE MR. CAL REUBER AND MS. MICHELLE APPEARED TO HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING THEIR PROMISSES. I AM CONCERN THAT DELAY TACTICS ARE BEING USED WITH US IN ORDER TO MAKE US WAIT UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT AT 60,000 MILES AVOIDING TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR COST. I HAVE LOOKED AT THE MECHANISM AND IT IS A VERY POOR ENGINEERING DESIGN WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER CHRYSLER CARS. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD! PLEASE HELP US PREVENT  AN UNNECESSARY SERIOUS ACCIDENT!  PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO CONTACT ME FOR MORE DETAILS IF NECESSARY. THANKS, RAFAEL L. RIVERA - A CONCERNED FATHER.  *AK",

I CALLED CHRYSLER AND EVEN THOUGH MY CAR WAS BUILT DURING THAT TIME THEY CLAIM THE VIN # WAS NOT ONE OF THE RECALLS THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS GOING TO REPLACE THE PART WITH A USED 96 PART, I AM AFRAID IT MY BE DEFECTIVE. ALSO, NOT THE TO MENTION THE LEFT CONTROL ARM STILL ON THE CAR AS ORIGINAL. I THINK THE LEAST THEY SHOULD DO IS ONCE THE PART IS ON MY CAR THEY SHOULD TEST THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE FREE OF CHARGE AND REPLACE THEM IF THEY FAIL. I ALSO SHOULD BE RE-IMBRUST FOR MY $500.00 I HAD TO PAY MY INSURANCE COMPANY, BECAUSE IF THAT PART DID FAIL, IT ALSO CAUSED THE SNAPPING OF MY HALF SHAFT ON THE LEFT SIDE.
