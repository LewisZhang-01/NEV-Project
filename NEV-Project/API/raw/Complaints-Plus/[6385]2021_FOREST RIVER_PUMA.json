We requested that service look at that as well during the repair process.  They discovered though the spec calls out a hitch weight of 700lbs, ours was weighing 1100lbs.  That is a 57% INCREASE in hitch weight.  Enough that it exceed the 1000lb limit of the hitch system (which we purchased at the time with the camper), and the limit of our trucks gross vehicle weight rating.    This added weight also limited our rear axle rating",
