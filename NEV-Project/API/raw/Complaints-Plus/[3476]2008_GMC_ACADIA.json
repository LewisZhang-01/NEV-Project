ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS REPAIRS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY OTHERS ALSO.  2 OF MY REPAIRS HAD RECALLS AFTER WE HAD PAID FOR THE REPAIR.  HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED BY GMC FOR PARTS ONLY FOR STABILIZER KIT, POWER STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY AND RACK N PINION BUT NOT THE LIFTGATE YET.  I CONTACTED GMC CUSTOMER CARE REQUESTING THEY LOOK INTO INCLUDING THE 2008 BUT WAS TOLD IT ISN'T INCLUDED AND ALL THEY COULD DO IS GIVE US A $2000.000 VOUCHER FOR A NEW OR LEASED GMC. (CASE #8-1702070910)  I TRIED TO CONTACT GMC AT A HIGHER LEVEL (GMPRIORITYCARE@GM.COM) SENDING THEM  A REQUEST TO REVIEW 2008 RECALLS FOR SWAY BAR END LINKS. FRONT AND BACK ROTORS, SUN ROOF LEAKING, FRONT GAS STRUTS, PURGE VALVE, VENT CONTROL SOLENOID AND AMPLIFIER. INCLUDED A COPY OF MY REPAIR LOG AND SUMMARY OF COMPLAINTS ON CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR 2007-15 ACADIAS.  THEY RESPONDED WITHIN 36 HOURS BY HAVING TIFFANY (THE ORIGINAL CONTACT AT GMC) TELLING AGAIN ALL THEY CAN DO IS THE $2000.00 VOUCHER. SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY DID NO RESEARCH AT ALL AND I'M OUT OF LUCK.  I THINK GMC NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS AND NOT TELL ME THEY A MAN MADE PRODUCT, THEY DON'T LAST FOREVER.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

IT WOULDN'T START SO AFTER LOCATING THE BATTERY IN THE PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD THE BATTERY BOX WAS FULL OF WATER. I VACUUM THAT OUT. I LET IT DRY FOR A WHILE AND JUMP IT OFF. IT CRANKED FINE AND I LET IT IDLE FOR A WHILE.  I CLOSED THE DOORS WITH WINDOWS DOWN WITH IT STILL RUNNING AND PUT A FAN IN THE FRONT SEAT. IT WAS SITTING IN MY GARAGE RUNNING, WITH A BOX FAN IN THE FRONT SEAT BLOWING, I SHUT THE DOORS WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN, AND ABOUT 30 SECONDS AFTER I SHUT THE DOOR I AM STANDING BESIDE IT AND HEAR A LOUD EXPLOSION. I LOOK OVER AND BOTH SIDE CURTAIN LIKE AIR BAGS HAD DEPLOYED. THE CAR SHUTS OFF, THE FLASHERS COME ON.   AFTER I GAIN MY COMPOSURE FROM BEING SCARED TO DEATH FROM THE NOISE, I REACH IN AND TURN THE KEY OFF. AFTER THAT I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY BECAUSE I WAS THEN AFRAID IT MAY BLOW MORE AIR BAGS OR SHORT OUT AND CATCH FIRE.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND NOTICE THERE ARE TONS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ROOF LEAKS, THERE ARE A FEW TECHNICAL BULLETINS THAT GM HAS ABOUT IT AS WELL, HOWEVER THERE WAS NO RECALL SINCE IT ISN'T A SAFETY ISSUE. WELL, IF THE ROOF LEAK IS GETTING ENOUGH WATER IN THE VEHICLE THAT IT CAUSES THE AIR BAGS TO DEPLOY FOR NO REASON, I BELIEVE THIS IS A REAL SAFETY CONCERN.   I AM JUST GRATEFUL I WASN'T DRIVING IT AND MY 2 YOUNG KIDS WERE NOT IN THE VEHICLE WHEN IT HAPPENED.   I JUST BOUGHT LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AGO FROM A DEALER.

BEGINNING IN 2014, AFTER NARROWLY AVOIDING SERIOUS FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAR LIFT GATE WHILE LOADING THE VEHICLE, SUFFERING MINOR SCRAPS AND BRUISING. I  BROUGHT MY VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST GMC SERVICE CENTER AND RECEIVED A QUOTE FOR REPLACEMENT STRUTS. I LATER HAD THEM REPLACED IN 2015 AT MY OWN EXPENSE, ONLY MORE RECENTLY BECOMING AWARE THAT IT WAS DUE TO A PART FAILURE AND SUBJECT TO RECALL AND REPLACEMENT. OF WHICH I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH A REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST.    FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENT MY STEERING COLUMN TIGHTENED DURING TURNS FORCING ME TO EXERT EXTREME PRESSURE IN SLOW SPEED TURNS, CREATING A HAZARD TO BOTH MYSELF AND OTHERS. AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PERFORMING OF STATED REMEDIES PRESCRIBED BY THE GMC SERVICE MECHANIC, THE PROBLEM STILL PERSIST AND MORE RECENTLY IT BEING SUGGESTED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO SUSPENSION STRUTS AND POSSIBLY TRANSMISSION ISSUES SINCE THE 'CHECK ENGINE' LIGHT WAS ON WITH FOR CODES RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE WERE PRESENT.     THROUGH MY OWN RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE RELATED TO EITHER RECALLED ITEMS OR ITEMS  LISTED IN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS, YET NOW I'M BEING TOLD THAT MY COST WOULD BE $1900 FOR REPAIRS AND AN ADDITIONAL $1500 TO REPLACE A FAULTY NAVIGATION/ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM, DUE TO A SUCK DISC.    COLLECTIVELY, I FIND THESE EVENTS, THE MECHANICAL FAILURES AND THE FACT THAT THE BURDEN FOR THESE FAILURES AND EVENTS ARE BEING PLACED ON THE CUSTOMER AS BEING ABSURD AND EGREGIOUS.

SINCE THEN I BEEN TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME THE CAR IS TOO OLD AND OVER THE WARRANTY. BUT THEY CONSIDERED HELPING AT FIRST SINCE I DIDN'T REACH 100,000 MILES YET BUT ONCE THEY SPOKE TO THE DISTRICT MANAGER FROM MY DEALER HER SAID NO  ASSISTANCE. GMC HAS BEEN KNOWING ABOUT THE ISSUE SINCE THEY MANUFACTURED THIS CAR AND HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. THE PARTS ON THE  INSIDE OF THE TRANSMISSION ARE BREAKING APART BECAUSE OF FAULTY MATERIAL. WHY IS THE CUSTOMER HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING THE CUSTOMER HAS NO CONTROL OVER. IF I DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL I GET HELD RESPONSIBLE A MANUFACTURER SHOULD TOO. JUST BECAUSE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE TO 83000 MILES AND OVER THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY WHY SHOULD I ENDURE THE FULL COST OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED BY THE MANUFACTURER.

FURTHERMORE, THE ENGINE/TIMING COVER WAS ALREADY REPLACED AT 23,118 MILES.  THE DEALERSHIP ASKED US TO VERIFY THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NO FLOOD HISTORY, GET DETAILS OF THE WARRANTY PROVIDED BY THE DEALER FROM WHOM WE PURCHASED IT, AND PROVIDE MAINTENANCE RECORDS.  WE DID THAT.  THE DEALERSHIP FIRST TOLD US THEY WOULD GIVE US $1,000 OFF A NEW VEHICLE (REALLY?).  WE SAID WE STILL HAD A LOAN AND PAYMENT.  THEY ADVISED US THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COME CLOSE TO OUR CURRENT PAYMENT.  WHEN WE SPOKE WITH THEM NEXT, THEY ADVISED THAT GM WOULD NOT BE PROVIDING ANY ASSISTANCE AND THAT THEY THINK NOW IT IS JUST A VALVE ISSUE.  HOW CAN YOU GO FROM 2 BENT RODS TO A VALVE ISSUE?  WE TOLD THE DEALERSHIP TO PUT THE VEHICLE BACK TOGETHER; WE WERE COMING TO GET IT.  WE TOWED IT HOME.  WE CONTACTED GM AGAIN TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT A BAD EXPERIENCE WE HAD WITH A DEALERSHIP THAT KEPT CHANGING THEIR STORY ABOUT WHAT GM WAS GOING TO DO TO HELP AND WHAT OUR PROBLEMS WERE.  THEY ADVISED US WE COULD TAKE IT TO ANOTHER GARAGE AND HAVE ALL THE DIAGNOSTICS DONE AGAIN (AT OUR EXPENSE).  THEN THE DEALERSHIP COULD CONTACT THEM TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY COST ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE.  THEY SAID THAT SINCE WE DIDN'T BUY OUR VEHICLE FROM A GM DEALER AND DIDN'T SERVICE IT AT A GM DEALER (WE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE PRIOR TO THIS), WE WOULDN'T SCORE HIGH FOR COST ASSISTANCE FROM GM.  WE AREN'T THE ONLY ONE IN THIS SITUATION ACCORDING TO RESEARCH.  HELP!  *TR",

SOON AFTER, GMC STARTED DOING THE RECALLS ON THE AIRBAGS. MY ACADIA IS NOT ONE OF THE LISTED RECALLED VEHICLES. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS.

GMC NEEDS TO RECALL EVERY 2008 ACADIA. I HAVE ALSO BEEN DEALING WITH PROBLEMS WITH THE POWER STEERING. ONE DAY DRIVING, I STARTED TO MAKE A TURN, AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT. IT WAS LIKE TURNING A REALLY OLD MODEL CAR THAT HAD NO POWER STEERING. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TODAY. GMC TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE POWER STEERING. THEY CANNOT FIND THE PROBLEM, YET I KNOW FOR SURE SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE 2008 GMC ACADIA IS NOT A SAFE CAR. I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN, AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING WITH THEM AND THE CHECK AIRBAG LIGHT STILL ON. MY FAMILY IS VERY UPSET WITH GMC AS A COMPANY!! SAFETY SHOULD BE THE MAIN CONCERN BEFORE SELLING ANY VEHICLE. I SEE THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THEIR ACADIA.

IT STARTS GOING, BUT THEN GOES BACK OUT AGAIN. WE'VE HAD TOWED IT TO OUR FINAL DESTINATION. WE ARE NOW MORE THAN $4500 OUT OF POCKET AND RUINED OUR FAMILY TRIP, WE COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE. A TRANSMISSION SHOULDN'T GO OUT WITH ONLY 72K MILES. WE SEE THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH GMC ACADIA AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE BY GMC. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ALONG WITH THE POWER STEERING ISSUES. MANY FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THESE MAJOR ISSUES, AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO AFTER PAYING SO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS VEHICLE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AND GET RELIEF FOR ACADIA OWNERS!! GMC IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND CONTINUE TO IGNORE THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

I HAVE 3 YOUNG CHILDREN AND THE RESULT OF SUCH SUDDEN SHIFTING COULD HAVE CAUSED WHIPLASH AND DID CAUSE FEAR.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AUTO SCHNEIDER IN WEIDEN GERMANY WHO IDENTIFIED THE SPEED SENSOR AS THE PROBLEM VIA THE COMPUTER AND REPLACED THE PART.  BY 10 MAY 2013 THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY IMMOBILE.  I CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND OVER 1000 ENTRIES SPECIFYING THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AROUND 70000 MILES, AND SOMETIMES TWICE, WITH GMC COVERING 0 COSTS.

SO THEY SAID WITH A BIG MAN IN IT  REGISTERED LIKE AN INFANT SITTING THERE! SAID IT WOULD COST $800 TO REPLACE IT!!! THIS CAR IS IN LIKE NEW CONDITION AND I DO NOT HAVE A DAILY PASSENGER! I'M THINKING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE SINCE DAY ONE!!! THANK GOD I DIDN'T GET IN A COLLISION AND LOSE A LOVED ONE ! THIS WOULD BE A HUGE LAWSUIT!!!! I AM GONNA SEE IF GMC WILL PAY FOR THIS FIX!

I'M JUST GLAD MY WIFE WASN'T DRIVING AT NIGHT, ON A LONG TRIP, OR ON THE INTERSTATE, WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT MY CHILDREN AND HER IN A VERY VULNERABLE POSITION. FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE, I WOULD EXPECT RELIABLE USAGE UP TO AT LEAST 100,000 MILES.    IN MY OPINION, BECAUSE OF RELIABILITY ISSUES AND THE SHEAR VOLUME OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, GMC SHOULD RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND REPLACE THE TRANSMISSIONS WITH WHAT THEY ARE NOW INSTALLING ON THE NEWER MODELS. THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE IMPROVED THE TRANSMISSIONS ON NEWER MODELS PROVES THERE IS A FLAW WITH MY MODEL YEAR. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY CORRECT IT.    THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION SEEMED LIKE IT DID NOT KNOW WHAT GEAR IT WAS IN HENCE GOING FROM 50 MPH TO 30 RAPIDLY COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. HAD I BEEN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION OR PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A LIFE THREATENING ACCIDENT. WE CONTACTED ONSTAR AND THE CODES INDICATED TRANSMISSION PROBLEM OF A BROKEN WAVE PLATE. CODE P2715 THE ACADIA WILL NOT BACK UP AT ALL. THERE ARE NUMEROUS BLOGS OF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE ACADIA'S WAVE PLATE RANGING IN THE YEAR OF 2007-2009. SEEMS LIKE IT IS A REALLY BAD DESIGN AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TYPE OF SUV.  I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY GMC IS NOT RECALLING OR OFFERING TO PAY TO  FIX THESE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS. I AM ABOUT TO BE OUT $4,000 BECAUSE I HAVE NO WARRANTY LEFT AND GMC AND CARMAX ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP. I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR 4 MONTHS AND IT ONLY HAS 93,000 MILES AND IT MAKES ME SICK BECAUSE THE 5 YEAR 100,000 MILE WARRANTY WAS OUT IN JANUARY. I AM ASHAMED FOR GMC NOT WANTING TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND THAT OUR SAFETY IS OF NO INTEREST TO THEM. GMC CLAIMS I DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH BUSINESS CASE BECAUSE I BOUGHT FROM CARMAX AND NOT FROM A CERTIFIED GMC DEALER. I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A CHEVROLET TRAILBLAZER AND DIDN'T HAVE THIS MANY PROBLEMS AND IT HAD 130,000 MILES WHEN I SOLD IT TO GET THIS ONE. I DON'T THINK I WILL BE BUYING ANY GMC PRODUCT AGAIN SINCE THEY APPARENTLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH PAST 5 YEARS FOR A TRANSMISSION OR ENGINE WHICH IS PITIFUL FOR AN AMERICAN OWNED COMPANY. NOW WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GO ON OUR YEARLY VACATION THANKS TO GMC AND THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO BACK THEIR PRODUCTS THAT THEY KNOW ARE FAULTY. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY VALID COMPLAINT AND MY CONCERN FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY WHO OWNS AN ACADIA.  *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM SEEMS TO VERY WIDESPREAD BASED ON THE NUMBER OF RESPONSES ON VARIOUS WEBSITES, BUT DOESN'T SEEM THAT IT IS BEING SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED BY GM MANAGEMENT AND IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  *TR",

BOTH FRONT FLOOR MATS SATURATED WITH WATER AS WELL AS THE CARPET UNDERNEATH.  IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT ALL OF THE WATER POURING OUT HAS BEEN WITNESS WHILE DRIVING.

WE HAVE PUT OUR BASEMENT ROOM DEHUMIDIFIER IN OUR ACADIA IN THE GARAGE ON THIS SIXTH NIGHT TO HELP DRY OUT ALL THE WATER IN THE CARPET AND WE ARE SURE IN THE ROOF LINER TO HOPEFULLY HELP WITH ANY MOLD THAT MAY HAVE STARTED.

THIS HAS JUST BEEN VERY UPSETTING AND I AM TIRED OF DEALING WITH GM AND THE SALESPERSON I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM IS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED I CONTACT YOU. AGAIN WE BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW.  THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE WRONG IS I STILL HAVE WATER LEAKING IN THE TOP OF THE DRIVERS WINDOW WHEN IT'S SITTING DURING A HARD RAIN,, MY FAN MOTOR FOR THE A/C AND HEAT GOES UP AND DOWN ALL BY IT'S SELF AND PAINT IS PEELING OFF THE HOOD.  THESE ARE THINGS I GUESS I CAN DEAL WITH BUT THE SEAT HAS GOT TO GET CORRECTED. I HOPE YOU CAN HELP, THANK YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM SOMEONE. *TR",

        "summary": "OWN A 2008 GMC ACADIA THAT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP 5 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN AUGUST FOR THE  AIR BAG SYSTEM.  THE LIGHT FIRST CAME ON IN OCT. OF 2008, AFTER DRIVING ONLY 4000 MILES.  THE PROBLEM WAS  UNABLE TO BE DIAGNOSED BY GMC SERVICE AS THE LIGHT CAME ON INTERMITTENTLY. THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF FAULTY WIRING, BUT LIGHT STILL CAME ON AFTER WIRING WAS REPAIRED.  AFTER THE SECOND TRIP TO GMC, , THE FRONT SEAT AIR BAG WAS REPLACED ON DRIVER SIDE IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I HAD TO WAIT THREE WEEKS FOR THE PART TO COME IN THOUGH, AS THEY WERE BACK ORDERED. AS SOON AS I DROVE OFF THE LOT WITH THE DRIVER'S SEAT AIR BAG REPLACED, THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  THIS WAS THE FOURTH TIME NOW, AND THE VERY SAME DAY!   THIS TIME I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG. IT TOO WAS  REPLACED IN HOPES OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  ONE MONTH LATER THE LIGHT IS ON AGAIN.  I ONCE AGAIN NOTIFIED GMC OF THE ISSUE AS I FEEL THE AIR BAG SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE, AND DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY FAMILY IN THE CAR. I HAVE STATED THIS TO THE DEALERSHIP AND GMC, SOMETHING HAS TO BE WRONG WHEN THE SERVICE AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON EVERY MONTH.  I HAVE READ MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND ALSO ONE OF THE AIR BAGS NOT DEPLOYING DURING A CRASH.  THIS IS MY BIGGEST FEAR, AND NOW WILL BE PURSUING OTHER AVENUES TO RETURN THIS VEHICLE TO GMC. *TR",

THE BATTERY IS SOMEHOW BEING DISCHANGED. OTHER THAN REPLACING THE ORIGINAL BATTERY, ON THE FIRST OCCURANCE, THE DEALER SERVICE CAN NOT SEEM TO TRACK DOWN THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. THEY SAY THAT THE CHARGING SYSTEM CHECKS OUT OK. IT DOES SEEM TO START FINE FOR A WHILE, SEVERAL WEEKS, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WILL HAVE A DEAD BATTERY OVER NIGHT. NOTHING IS EVER LEFT ON. I CHECK THAT EACH TIME THE GARAGE DOOR IS CLOSED. THE HEADLIGHTS ALWAYS GO OUT IN ONE MINUTE, IF ON.  WHILE DRIVING I DO NOTICE THE VOLTMETER ON NUMEROUS OCCASSIONS WELL STAY AT ABOUT +15 VOLT CHARGING RATE. I KNOW THAT IT SHOULD BE NO HIGHER THAN ABOUT +13.5 VOLTS, AND SOMETIMES IT DOES, BUT MOST TIMES, NOT.   I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE FIRE DANGER AND BEING STRANDED SOMWHERE.  I AM AN AIRCRAFT A&P. MY TROUBLE SHOOTING THOUGHTS POINT TO A STARTER SHORTING. I COULD BE WRONG BUT I WOULD START THERE AND PROVE THAT NOT TO BE THE PROBLEM. EASIEST FIX FIRST, THE AIR FORCE WAY.  *TR",
