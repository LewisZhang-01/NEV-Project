Sure enough the front driver side door is not locking. I need to spend another 950 dollars to get it fixed. What is wrong with these actuators?

THIS COULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME POSING A SECURITY RISK TO ME, MY PASSENGERS AND CARGO. EVENTUALLY THE LOCK STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY AND I HAD IN REPAIRED AT THE DEALER IN MARCH COSTING $500 . THE DEALER CLAIMED THERE WERE NO RECALLS OR SAFETY CAMPAIGNS EVEN THOUGH I CAN SEE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT TOYOTA DOOR LOCKS ON THE INTERNET.  IN JUNE 2018 THE SAME THINGS BEGAN OCCURRING WITH THE DRIVER DOOR LOCK. THE LOCK WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO FORCE OPEN OR CLOSED MANUALLY OR WITH THE KEY FROM OUTSIDE. AGAIN IT POSED A SAFETY RISK ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT TO FORCE OPEN IN AN EMERGENCY.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND AGAIN THE DEALER CLAIMS THERE ARE NO RECALLS OR CAMPAIGNS AND THIS TIME IT COST $600. I'VE HAD MANY CARS AND TRUCKS FOR DECADES AND NEVER HAD TO REPLACE LOCK ACTUATORS NEVER MIND 2 WITHIN A FEW MONTHS.  IN JANUARY 2019 THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR LOCK SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING AND NOW I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING. SO THIS SAGA CONTINUES.
