SINCE THE AAA AGENT WAS ABLE TO GET TO START, I DECIDED TO STILL TAKE IT TO THE DEALER TO FIND OUT WHY THE BATTERY WAS DEAD (GIVEN THEY HAD THE CAR FOR A MONTH AND HAD PUT IN A NEW BATTERY AND STARTER, AMONG OTHER REPAIRS).  DRIVING THE 7 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP THE CAR SEEMED TO BE ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN, THE ENTIRE WAY, I ONLY STEPPED ON THE GAS ONCE; IT WAS GOING 35 MILES/HOUR BY ITSELF (PER THE SPEEDOMETER).  I DIDN'T KNOW WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING AND WHEN I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN USING THE BRAKES, THE TRUCK WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP, SUCH THAT I NEARLY REAR-ENDED MULTIPLE CARS.  IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO PUSH THE BRAKE DOWN AND TWICE HUGE AMOUNTS OF SMOKE CAME FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE (PROBABLY THE BRAKES WERE NOW OVERHEATING?).  WHEN I WAS 500 FEET FROM THE DEALERSHIP I TOOK A QUICK LEFT TURN AND HONESTLY COULD NOT STOP THE TRUCK, I THREW IT INTO PARK AND SHUT IT OFF JUST IN TIME TO MISS PLOWING INTO PARKED VEHICLES.  SMOKE BILLOWED OUT FROM BELOW THE HOOD.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO FRIGHTENED IN MY LIFE-I WAS SURE I WAS EITHER GOING TO SMASH INTO SOMEONE SINCE I COULDN'T STOP OR THE TRUCK WAS GOING TO IMPLODE IN FIRE, OR SOMETHING AND I WOULD BE DEAD.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY STOP IT USING THE BRAKES.  THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ALSO NOT WORKING (WHICH IS ALSO WHY I WAS RETURNING IT TO THE DEALER).  WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP IF HE'D SEEN A STUCK THROTTLE LIKE THIS BEFORE, HE SAID, \"YES, SOMETIMES WHEN VEHICLES SIT FOR A WHILE\".  THIS IS A SATURDAY, SO THEY ARE GOING TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEM ON MONDAY.

IT'S CLEAR THAT ONCE YOU FILL THE REAR TANK AND THEN TRAVEL, THE FUEL, WHICH SHOULD RETURN TO THE REAR TANK IN A CYCLE, DOES NOT. IT SIMPLY RETURNS TO THE FRONT TANK, UNTIL IT FILLS THE FRONT TANK AND FLOODS OUT. THE PUMP IN THE REAR TANK APPEARS TO JUST CONTINUE TO RUN, FOR EXAMPLE,,,,  YOU HAVE A FULL REAR TANK. YOU HAVE HALF A TANK OF FUEL IN THE FRONT TANK. YOU DRIVE. THE REAR TANK PUMP, PUMPS ALL OF THE FULL REAR TANK INTO THE FRONT TANK. SO, HALF A TANK OF GAS FLOWS OUT OF THE FRONT TANK, ONTO THE GROUND.  OBVIOUSLY, THE CYCLE, WHERE THE FUEL SHOULD GO FROM REAR, TO ENGINE AND BACK, ISN'T HAPPENING. INSTEAD, THE FUEL ROLLS BY THE ENGINE AND RETURNS TO A FULL FRONT TANK, RATHER THAN THE REAR TANK, SO, ONTO THE GROUND GOES THE FUEL.   ON AN OLDER RECALL REPORT, THE REPAIR IS DESCRIBED, WHERE THE 'JUMPER' MUST BE REPLACED, DESPITE THE FACT THERE'S NO SUCH THING, THERE'S A FUEL PUMP AND PROBABLY SOME SORT OF 'BI-VALVE' THAT SOMEONE'S POOR ENGINEERING FAILED ON THE WHOLE, AT THE TIME OF DESIGN.
