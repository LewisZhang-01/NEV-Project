I WAS STOPPED AT THE ENTRY OF A PARKING, THE ENGINE RACED AND THE CAR PLOUGHED AHEAD, ALTHOUGH I CONTINUOUSLY APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. THE C5 ACCELERATED AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND STOPPED ONLY AFTER I APPLIED THE PARKING BRAKE AND CUT THE IGNITION. THE CAR WAS REPAIRED. THE HEAD MECHANIC, ASSURED ME MY CAR WAS IN ORDER WHEN I TOOK IT BACK. I  REQUESTED  THE GARAGE CONSULT A GM EXPERT ON THAT SORT OF ACCIDENT. HE DID NOT COMPLY WITH THAT REQUEST.THE DYSFUNCTION OCURRED AGAIN.  SECOND ACCIDENT : MAY 7TH, 03. I PARKED. I HAD, AT THE END OF THIS MANEUVER, THE RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE, (TO SLOW THE CAR WHICH AT THIS TIME CRAWLED), WHEN THE ENGINE ACCELERATED. THE C5 STOPPED AFTER I JAMMED ON THE BRAKE AND CUT THE IGNITION  REMARKS AND CONCLUSION. THE C5 SUDDENLY TOOK OFF ON IT'S OWN, THE THROTTLE IN A FULL OPEN POSITION, WITHOUT THE DRIVER STEPPING ON  THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE BRAKES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE SOON ENOUGH TO AVOID THE ACCIDENTS. ONLY SWITCHING OFF THE IGNITION WAS EFFECTIVE TO STOP THE VEHICLE. I HAD MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE GEAR LEVER WAS IN DRIVE.  AS ANY ENGINEER KNOWS, GIVEN THAT ELECTRONIC LOGIC IS SENSITIVE TO INTERFERENCES AND THE C5 COMPARTMENT IS FLOODED  WITH VIOLENTS SIGNALS; IT WAS IMPERATIVE, AFTER THE FIRST SERIOUS INCIDENT, TO INSTALL A BLACK BOX OR TIMESTAMPING RECORDING DEVICE, FILMING AND RECORDING THE ACTUAL FOOT POSITION OF THE DRIVER, THE THROTTLE AND BRAKE POSITIONS, ENGINE RPM AND VEHICLE SPEED IN ORDER TO ANALYZE A POSSIBLE RE-OCCURENCE OF THE EVENT. BEING A SURGEON, CONSIDERING THE GRAVITY OF THIS DOUBLE AND IDENTICAL ACCIDENT, NOT ONLY TO RENONCE USING THIS C5, BUT ALSO TO ASK THAT ALL THE C5 BE SUBJECT TO A FACTORY RECALL TO CONTROL ALL THEIR ELECTRONIC, TO CORRECT THE DEFECTS AND ORIGIN OF SUCH DYSFUNCTIONS AND PREVENT SUCH ACCIDENTS.*AK",

ONE OF THE SCREWS HAS A POINTED CONE SHAPED TOP. A FUEL LINE AND AIR LINE RUN DIRECTLY OVER THIS SCREW. THERE WAS A POST ON LS1.COM NOTIFYING OWNERS OF 1998 Z28 CAMAROS OF THIS POTENTIAL DESIGN DEFECT AND FOR OWNERS TO CHECK THEIR VEHICLES FOR PREMATURE WEAR AND POSSIBLE RUPTURE OF  THE FUEL LINE. I INSPECTED MY VEHICLE AND THE FUEL LINE. THE SCREW HAD WORN THROUGH THE INSULATION AND EITHER INTO THE AIR LINE OR FUEL LINE. I WENT TO SUPERIOR CHEVROLET IN SHAWNEE KANSAS AND SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND INFORMED HIM OF THE PROBLEM. TO PROVE THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS DEFECT WE RANDOMLY SELECTED ANOTHER 1998 Z28. IT HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. HE HAD ME LEAVE MY VEHICLE THE NEXT DAY. UPON RETURNING HE SAID THE FUEL WAS INSPECTED AND THAT IT WAS OK. THE FIX WAS TO RELOCATE THE FUEL AND AIR LINE WITH A PLASTIC WIRE-TIE.  I VOICED MY CONCERNS WITH FIX, BUT WAS ASSURED THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN CORRECTED. IT STILL CONCERNS ME HOWEVER, THAT THE LINES COULD HAVE BEEN INSPECTED WITHOUT REMOVING THE INSULATION FROM THE LINES TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE WEAR AND PENETRATION OF EITHER THE AIR LINE OR FUEL LINE.  THE FUEL LINE AND AIR LINE ASSEMBLY HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS DEFECT CAN HARM THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THE DESIGN DEFECT CAN WEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FUEL LINE AND CAUSE GASOLINE TO LEAK ONTO THE HOT ENGINE, OR EXHAUST MANIFOLD, CAUSING A FIRE OR EXPLOSION, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO OBVIOUSLY BURN UP THE CAR AND ALSO HARM OR KILL PASSENGERS IN THE CAR. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE NHTSA WILL EXAMINE THIS PROBLEM AND DEMAND THAT GM ISSUE A RECALL TO CORRECT THIS MAJOR DESIGN DEFECT AND (NOT WITH A CHEAP WIRE-TIE).

AFTER CHANGING MY SPARK PLUGS AND INSPECTING THE FUEL LINE, THE SCREW ON THE #1 COIL PACK HAS WORN THROUGH THE INSULATION AND PART OF THE FUEL LINE. I WENT TO BUD ALLAN CHEVROLET IN HAYWARD AND TALKED TO GEORGE RODRIGUEZ, A SERVICE CONSULTANT AND INFORMED HIM OF THIS PROBLEM. HE INFORMED ME THAT MY PREMIUM EXTENDED WARRANTY (FACTORY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED SINCE 36,000 MILES) DOES NOT COVER THE WORN THROUGH FUEL LINE.

THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW AND THE PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO RECUR IF GM REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE USED.
