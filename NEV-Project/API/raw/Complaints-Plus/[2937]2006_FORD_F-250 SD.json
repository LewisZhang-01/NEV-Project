I INSPECTED THE TRUCK AND THE FRONT RIGHT ROTOR WAS SMOKING AND GLOWING RED HOT.  APPARENTLY THE BRAKE CALIPER HAD SEIZED AFTER APPLICATION.  I WENT INSIDE WALMART TO KILL TIME AND LET THE BRAKES COOL OFF, HOPING THAT WHEN COOLED, THE CALIPER WOULD RELEASE AND THE TRUCK WOULD BE DRIVABLE.  AFTER APPROXIMATELY 1-1/2 HOURS, I RETURNED TO THE TRUCK AND NOTED THAT THE WHEEL WAS NOT SMOKING, BUT WAS STILL RADIATING HEAT.  I BEGAN TO DRIVE THE TRUCK AND IT DROVE WITHOUT ANY NOTICEABLE ISSUES UNTIL I APPLIED THE BRAKES AGAIN TO STOP AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT.  AFTER RELEASING THE BRAKE, THE TRUCK WAS NOW PULLING TO THE LEFT.  EXPECTING A SIMILAR ISSUE, I DECIDED TO DRIVE DIRECTLY TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN PASCAGOULA.  HOWEVER, UPON NEEDING TO APPLY THE BRAKES AGAIN, THEY DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I HAD TO USE THE PARKING BRAKE TO BRING THE TRUCK TO A STOP AS THE REGULAR BRAKES HAD COMPLETELY FAILED.  I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR BRAKE ISSUES (PULLING AND HEATING FROM SEIZED CALIPERS) AND IN JUNE 2015 HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO THE ONE IN 2011.

FORD HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN #06129 AND NHTSA #10020174 WHICH COVERS \"NOISY\" FRONT WHEEL BEARINGS.  THE FIX IS TO REPLACE THE BEARINGS AND INSTALL MOISTURE AND DUST SHIELDS WHICH DO NOT COME WITH A NEW VEHICLE AT THE CUSTOMER EXPENSE.  THE REASON WHY THE BEARINGS FAILED IS BECAUSE WATER INTRUDES INTO THE BEARING AREA AND WASHES AWAY OR DILUTES THE GREASE.

AFTER THE LAST INCIDENT ON 8/2/2006, I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER ON 8/5/2006. THIS WAS NOW THE SECOND TIME VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT INTO A FORD DEALERSHIP FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE FIRST DEALERSHIP REQUIRED THAT I REPRODUCE THIS PROBLEM FOR THE TECH WORKING ON THE VEHICLE. I WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS FINE WITH THE VEHICLE. THIS SECOND DEALERSHIP HAD MY TRUCK UNTIL 8/11/2006 AND SAID THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN CORRECTED. I WAS TOLD SOME METAL BUSHINGS WERE REPLACED IN THE FRONT END AND THAT CHAMBER OR CASTER WAS WAY OFF. I WAS ALSO TOLD TO MAKE SURE AND ROTATE TIRES AT SUGGESTED INTERVALS AND TO KEEP TIRES PROPERLY INFLATED. I NOTICED WHEN I LEFT THAT THE TRUCK HAD A CHOPPY BOUNCE TO THE RIDE AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS FROM THE TIRE WEAR. THE ODOMETER READING AT THAT TIME WAS 22065. AFTER DRIVING THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 3000 MILES, I TOOK THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK. THEY ROAD TESTED THE TRUCK, THEN REBALANCED ALL 4 TIRES AND REINDEXED THE REAR TIRES. THESE ARE THE TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ON THE FRONT AND ROTATED AT THE SECOND DEALERSHIP. THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO HAVE A CHOPPY BOUNCE II THE RIDE, WHICH NOW I WAS TOLD WAS NORMAL OR ACCEPTABLE. IF THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE RODE THAT WAY WHEN I PURCHASED IT, I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED IT. I WENT FROM HAVING A SMOOTH RIDING TRUCK THAT ON OCCASION HAD A SEVERE OSCILLATION IN THE FRONT END AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS 65 AND HIGHER, TO ONE THAT BOUNCES ALL THE TIME. THE BOUNCE IN THE RIDE WAS NOTICEABLE TO A FRIEND WHO OWNS A 2005 F250, THAT HAS HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS, ALTHOUGH OTHERS HAVE WITH THAT YEAR ALSO. TURNING TO FORD IN THIS MATTER HAS PROVED POINTLESS IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ADMIT A PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE OR THEIR OWN ENGINEERING  FLAWS.

I SHUT THE TRUCK DOWN LIKE THE FIRST TIME AND IT WENT AWAY AGAIN.

IS THIS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, CAN ANYONE SAY RECALL BEFORE PEOPLE DIE. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO MY LOCAL FORD WHEN I GOT BACK TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. THEY CHECKED, FOUND NOTHING AND WAS TOLD TO BRING IT BACK IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN OR IF I COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN. MOST RECENTLY NOW IT HAPPENED AGAIN(3RD TIME) ON 8/2/2008, ONCE AGAIN ON I95.

THIS CONDITION HAS MADE ME PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD MANY OF TIMES TO LET THE SEAT COOL DOWN WHICH TAKES A WHILE...ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  THIS SITUATION CREATES AN UNEXPECTED SUDDEN HEATING OF THE SEAT AND CAN MAKE THE OPERATOR VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
