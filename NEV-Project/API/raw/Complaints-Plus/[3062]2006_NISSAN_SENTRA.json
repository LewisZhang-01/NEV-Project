THE SUMMER OF 2007 I STARTED EXPERIENCING THE \"LONG ENGINE CRANK TIME BEFORE START\" ISSUE, AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE EVERY SUMMER SINCE (BUT ONLY DURING THE SUMMER). I CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY 54,000 MILES ON MY NISSAN AND JUST RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT THE SERVICE BULLETIN THAT WAS PUT OUT SEPTEMBER 8, 2006. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS BULLETIN ADVISING ME OF WHAT TO DO, EVEN AFTER INQUIRES OF MY ISSUE AT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP. NISSAN NO LONGER SELLS THE REPAIR KIT (WHICH I'M LEARNING WASN'T A GUARANTEE FIX) AND I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW FUEL PUMP (THAT NISSAN HAS SUPPOSEDLY REDESIGNED). THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE FUEL PUMP ITSELF, BUT RATHER A \"FAULTY\" PART INSIDE OF THE FUEL PUMP. NISSAN SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING \"FAULTY\" PARTS AND ALSO KEEPING THOSE PARTS AVAILABLE AS LONG AS THAT PARTICULAR YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL VEHICLE ARE ON THE ROAD.",

I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER, I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT WAS FINE.  THEN LATER THAT NIGHT AS I WAS SITTING WITH THE ENGINE AT AN IDLE, THE CAR SUDDENLY DIED BUT IT DID STARTED BACK UP.  I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO MY MECHANIC AND IT DIED 2 OR 3 TIMES WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT.  THE MECHANIC COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER CAME ON AND THE CAR DIDN'T THROW A CODE.  I BROUGHT THE CAR HOME AND PARKED IT BECAUSE I DO NOT FEELING SAFE DRIVING IT.  TONIGHT I SAT IN THE CAR AND TURNED IT ON TO SEE IF IT WOULD START.  IT DID START BUT EVERY SECOND OR SO THERE WAS AN LOUD CLICK FROM THE ENGINE AFTER WHICH THE CAR WOULD GIVE A SIZEABLE SHUDDER.  ALSO THE RPMS REV'D WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL OR PARK.  THEY WOULD DIP WHEN THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE OR REVERSE.  I SEE ON THE WEB THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE CAMSHAFT AND CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR.  I HAVEN'T CALLED NISSAN YET BUT AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE I HAVE NO HOPE THEY WILL HONOR THE RECALL AS MY VIN ISN'T INCLUDED.  I HOPE SOMEONE AT THE NHTSA FORCES AN EXPANDED RECALL.  IT ISN'T RIGHT THAT THOSE OF US HAVING PROBLEMS HAVE TO PAY FOR A KNOWN PROBLEM.  IN ADDITION, MY CAR IS NOW SITTING BECAUSE I'M SCARED OF DRIVING IT JUST TO HAVE IT DIE, CAUSING ME TO LOSE STEERING AND POSSIBLY BRAKES.

WHEN WE GOT IT TO THE MECHANIC SHOP THEY SAID IT WAS THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR AND THE CAM SENSOR THAT HAS FAILED. THEY TOLD US THAT NISSAN CARS ARE BAD ABOUT DOING THIS. I WAS IN A DANGEROUS SPOT WITH LOTS OF TRAFFIC AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND THERE COULD OF BEEN A BAD ACCIDENT OVER THIS BUT THANKFULLY THERE WAS NOT. ALSO ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR IS IT HAS DELAYED CRANKING WHEN TRYING TO START CAR IN SUMMERTIME WHEN IT IS HOT OUTSIDE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR USED ABOUT  FIVE YEARS AGO AND WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE WERE HAVING WITH IT STALLING OUT LIKE THAT.   *TR",

THE CAR WOULD DIE WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND BECAME VERY HARD TO START AS WELL AS THE OIL INTAKE BECAME EXCESSIVE.  AFTER 3 VISITS TO THE DEALERSHIPS AS WELL AS 3 VISITS TO LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOPS WITH ONLY TEMPORARY FIXES, I WAS AT LAST INFORMED AROUND MID DECEMBER 2012 BY ONE OF THE MECHANICS AT THE LOCAL SHOP THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON SIMILAR VEHICLES.  I LOOKED THE INFORMATION UP AND WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THERE WAS A RECALL IN 2006 AND 2007  ON 2006 NISSAN SENTRAS.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH NORTH AMERICAN NISSAN I LEARNED THAT THE RECALL WAS VIN SPECIFIC AND MY CAR, WHILE BEING THE SAME MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR AS THE VEHICLES RECALLED, WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. I SPOKE WITH A REGIONAL MANAGER OFF AND ON FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WHO INFORMED ME IN THE END THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I EVEN HAD A DIAGNOSTIC RAN AT THE NORTH LITTLE ROCK NISSAN DEALERSHIP ON DECEMBER 21, 2012 THAT STATES \"CRANKSHAFT, CAMSHAFT SENSORS MALFUNCTIONING BUT IN GOOD CONDITION, OIL EXTREMELY LOW(WHICH I JUST HAD IT CHANGED A FEW MONTHS AGO), AND POSSIBLE ECM PROBLEM...ALL THINGS STATED IN THE RECALL.
