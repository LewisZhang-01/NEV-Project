WE CALLED BACK ON MANY OCCASIONS ALL TO BE NEVER ANSWERED OR GIVEN A RUN AROUND, ONCE TOLD THEY WERE LOOKING INTO IT. NOTHING EVER CAME OF IT ALL. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SO WE GAVE UP, AT THE TIME WE COULD NOT AFFORD A LAWYER. SO TODAY?S NEWS WAS FRUSTRATING. MONTHS PRIOR TO MY ACCIDENT WE TOOK THE AVALON INTO DCH TOYOTA OF SIMI VALLEY TO CHECK OUT ACCELERATION PROBLEMS. THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT AND TOLD ME I NEEDED A TRANSMISSION FLUID EXCHANGE AND TO HAVE THE POWER STEERING FLUID FLUSHED.  WE WERE TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG; CLEARLY THERE WAS. I AM JUST CURIOS WHAT ACTIONS WE TAKE NOW. I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED. CAN YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME ON WHAT TO DO?

REPLACE THE STEERING RACK AND ALIGN\". SO AT A COST OF $1338.85 THE STEERING RACK WAS REPLACED.  I AGREE THAT  THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE ISSUED A RECALL TO FIX SINCE THEY KNEW ABOUT IT SINCE 2004 AND HAVE ISSUED VARIOUS SERVICE BULLETINS ON SUBJECT.    ON JANUARY 7, 2012 I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I AM STILL EXPERIENCING AN OIL LEAK THAT HAS GOTTEN WORSE. I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR IN NUMEROUS TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE WITH NO RESOLUTION. NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT THERE IS A LEAK AT TWO RETURN HOSED IN THE POWER STEERING COLUMN AND ARE CHARGING $500 FOR REPLACEMENT AND REPAIR. SO NOW IN A YEAR AND HALF I HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $2000 TO REPAIR THE STEERING ON A FAIRLY NEW CAR. WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL FOR THIS 2006 AVALON  STEERING ISSUE. APPARENTLY TOYOTA HAS NEVER RECTIFIED THE PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING AND CONTINUES TO MAKE MONEY ON SUBSTANDARD, DANGEROUS PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE SEVENTH TOYOTA THAT I HAVE OWNED AND THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH AND RECALLS FOR. YOU WOULD THINK THAT FOR THE COST OF THIS CAR, YOU WOULD GET BETTER QUALITY.

I WAS ABLE TO PLACE IN NETURAL AND BRAKE THE VEHICLE TO A STOP WHILE THE MOTOR WAS AT HIGH END REV.  I CHECKED TO SEE IF THE FLOOR MATS WERE OBSTRUCTING THE GAS PEDEL.  THEY WERE NOT.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND STARTED IT TWICE MORE, BOTH TIMES THE ENGINE WAS IN EXTREME HIGH REV MODE.  AS I SAT ON THE HIGHWAY, THE ACCELERATOR \"SPRANG\" BACK ON IT'S OWN.  I THEN STARTED THE ENGINE AGAIN AND IT WAS OPERATING NORMALLY.   I CALLED TOYOTA IMMEDIATELY AND WAS DIRECTED TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP IN CALIFORNIA.  I EVENTUALLY MADE IT TO A TOYOTA DEALER IN TULSA, OK, WHERE THE ON BOARD COMPUTER WAS \"FLASHED\" AND PEDEL RECALL WAS PERFORMED.

I TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER (TOYOTA OF IOWA CITY) WHO FELT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE DUE TO 'GEAR SHIFT SET POINTS' IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION'S COMPUTER PROGRAMMING. THEY REPROGRAMMED THE REVOLUTIONS AT WHICH TRANSMISSION WOULD SHIFT GEARS WHILE DRIVING. HOWEVER, THE SURGE PROBLEM PERSISTS. AS TIME GOES BY AND I READ MORE ABOUT TOYOTA'S ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE PART OF THE SAME ISSUE AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME DETAILED INFORMATION ON MY OBSERVATIONS. I HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT AND MADE SOME CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHICH CONDITIONS THE SURGE OCCURS DURING, AND WOULD LIKE TO DETAIL THIS FOR YOU. PERHAPS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE MY SURGE SITUATION IN OTHER TOYOTAS.    THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARM. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING IS NOT THE ISSUE, PUT THE TRANSMISSION MANUALLY INTO '3'. DRIVE ON LEVEL ROAD AT ABOUT 30MPH, THE ENGINE RPM'S WILL TYPICALLY BE ABOUT 2000. THEN, RELEASE FOOT FROM GAS PEDAL. THE ENGINE RPM'S WILL DROP TO ABOUT 1000, THEN SPONTANEOUSLY SURGE UPWARD TO ABOUT 1500 RPM. AT THAT POINT, SOMETHING SEEMS TO LIMIT THE RPM'S FROM INCREASING FURTHER. THIS CANNOT BE THE CORRECT OPERATION; WHEN ONE IS NOT STEPPING ON THE GAS PEDAL, THE ENGINE SHOULD SLOWLY REVERT BACK TO IDLE SPEED (OR BE GOVERNED BY 'ENGINE BRAKING EFFECTS' IF GOING DOWNHILL)...CORRECT? I THINK THAT IN A SITUATION WHERE THIS SPONTANEOUS LIMITATION OF RPM SURGING MIGHT NOT OCCUR, I COULD EXPERIENCE A 'WIDE-OPEN-THROTTLE' SITUATION THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR MORE DETAILS, I THINK MY CAR MIGHT HOLD SOME SECRETS TO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TOYOTA THROTTLE ISSUE. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES. *RM *TR",

MY 2006 AVALON HAS A LASER-GUIDED CRUISE CONTROL WHICH AUTOMATICALLY SLOWS DOWN MY VEHICLE WHEN IT APPROACHES TOO CLOSE TO THE VEHICLE AHEAD OF IT.  AFTER A SAFE DISTANCE IS ATTAINED, IT THEN ACCELERATES TO KEEP UP WITH THE VEHICLE AHEAD.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES IN SO DOING, THE VEHICLE SURGES AS IF I WERE FLOORING THE GAS PEDAL.  IT IS SCARY WHEN IT LUNGES FORWARD WITH SUCH A FORCE.  I  AM NO  LONGER USING THE CRUISE CONTROL FOR THIS REASON.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN CERTAIN CRUISE CONTROL DEFECT.

MARCH 2006 I BOUGHT A NEW TOYOTA AVALON XLS FROM DAVID BRUCE, BOURBONNAIS, IL. ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THIS PURCHASE, I WAS PULLING AWAY FROM A RED LIGHT ACCELERATING RATHER QUICKLY. WHEN I LET UP ON THE ACCELERATOR, THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE. WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKE WITH THE LEFT FOOT, I PUT MY RIGHT FOOT UNDER THE ACCELERATOR PETAL IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE IT. IT WAS NOT STUCK IN A DOWNWARD POSITION AND I WAS ABLE TO RAISE IT UP AND DOWN WITH MY FOOT WITH THE CAR STILL ACCELERATING. AT THIS POINT I STOMPED ON THE ACCELERATOR PETAL MANY HARD TIMES WITH MY RIGHT FOOT. FINALLY THE PROBLEM RESOLVED ITSELF AND THE ACCELERATION STOPPED. I TRIED TO DUPLICATE THIS PROBLEM MANY TIMES AFTERWARDS WITHOUT SUCCESS. I LOOKED AT THE ACCELERATOR PETAL, FLOOR MAT, AND THE AREA AROUND IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THE MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. I TALKED TO DAVID BRUCE ABOUT IT AND FIGURED IT WAS A FREAK OCCURRENCE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT AGAIN UNTIL THE NEWS MEDIA AND TOYOTA BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEM.  WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED, I DID NOT THINK OF USING THE START/OFF BUTTON TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, BUT AM AWARE OF IT NOW. THE REASON FOR THE LETTER IS THAT TOYOTA IS LOOKING AT THE DRIVER SIDE FLOOR MAT AS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT THE AREA WHERE THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING. IN MY CASE I AM 95 PERCENT CERTAIN IT WAS NOT A FLOOR MAT THAT CAUSED THE ACCELERATION AS I WAS ABLE TO PUT MY FOOT UNDER THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WITHOUT THE DECREASE ITS ACCELERATION. BUT, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO TOYOTA, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN UNKNOWN REASON WHY MY FLOOR MAT INTERACTED WITH THE ACCELERATOR PETAL THAT I DID NOT SEE.   *TR",

I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.    I WALKED IN TO DEALER TO SEE MY CAR AND THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THE BROKEN PART AND TOLD ME TOYOTA HAS SINCE REDESIGNED THIS PART SO IT DOES NOT BREAK AND CAUSE SUDDEN OIL LEAKS- ONCE THE NEW PART IS REPLACED I SHOULD NOT EXPECT MORE SIMILAR PROBLEMS- I AM KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED.    I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY MADE A NOTE OF MY PROBLEM BUT SAID I HAVE TO GET THE NUMBER OF THE TOYOTA REGIONAL MANAGER FROM THE DEALER WHO SAID HE CANNOT LET ME TALK DIRECTLY DUE TO\" BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM\".

I HAD 51K MILES, SO THE REPAIR WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY.    I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A NEW SOLID METAL TUBE AS IS USED ON THE 2009 MODELS TO REPLACE THE ONE THE DEALER INSTALLED WHICH STILL HAD THE RUBBER HOSE PORTION.     I HAVE PURCHASED TOYOTAS SINCE THE MID '80'S AND THIS IS MY FIRST SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT IN BOTH THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND THE CONDUCT OF THE COMPANY FOR NOT RECALLING THIS VEHICLE FOR THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

THEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD I SAW SMOKE AND SMELLED OIL.  THE VVTI OIL LINE WAS LEAKING AND HAD SORT OF \"BLOWN UP\" ALL OVER MY ENGINE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS VERY UPSET.  I WENT DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER.  IT WAS REPAIRED QUICKLY AND I PAID ALMOST $500.00 FOR THE REPAIR!     I THEN RESEARCHED ON-LINE AND BECAME AWARE THE VVTI OIL LINE LEAK WAS A PROBLEM FACED MY MANY AVALON OWNERS.  AFTERWARDS I REMEMBERED I HAD PURCHASED \"TOYOTA EXTRA CARE\" AND FREE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.  I SUPPOSE I SHOULD PROBABLY FILE A CLAIM WITH TOYOTA FOR REIMBURSEMENT; BUT I GUESS THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE!  I NOW REMEMBER TO TELL MY SERVICE TECH BEFORE EACH REPAIR!     NOW, A FEW MONTHS LATER, I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE ALL OVER AGAIN.  THIS TIME I AM EXTREMELY UPSET.  I CALLED TOYOTA ON NICHOLASVILLE AND WAS TOLD TO BRING MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP RIGHT AWAY AND THEY WOULD WORK ME IN THAT AFTERNOON.  I DID.  I KNEW THE PROBLEM WAS THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE VVTI LINE, AND REALIZED IT WOULD NOT BE REPAIRED THAT SAME DAY.       AFTER WAITING ABOUT TWO HOURS, THE TECH CAME AND SPOKE WITH ME.  HE TOLD ME IT WAS, ONCE AGAIN, A PROBLEM WITH THE VVTI OIL LINE.  ALTHOUGH TOYOTA DID HAVE A REPAIR PART AVAILABLE, IT WAS A BACK-ORDERED PART.  DAVE INDICATED MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS PART AND IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE AS LONG AS 4-8 WEEKS TO GET MY CAR REPAIRED.  I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS KIDDING.  FINALLY, HE CONVINCED ME HE WAS NOT!    I DID RECEIVE MY CAR BACK IN A WEEK.  SO FAR SO GOOD.    SEEMS TO ME THIS SHOULD BE A \"RECALL\" FROM TOYOTA.  I WISH I UNDERSTOOD WHY IT WAS NOT. *TR",

THIS PROBLEM COULD HAVE LEAD TO MY DAUGHTER AND I STRANDED ON HWY 495 IN WASHINGTON DC TRAFFIC, ON THE COLD HIGHWAY WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK TO PICK US UP BECAUSE THE ENGINE LOCKED UP.  THE REASON WHY I'M SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT IS BECAUSE I SPOKE, TO THREE DEALERSHIP, IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES AND EACH IDENTIFIED THIS AS A PROBLEM. EACH DEALERSHIP KNEW OF THIS DEFECTIVE PART AND PROBLEM. *TR",

AS WE APPROACHED A TRAFFIC SIGNAL THE TRUCK SLOWED AND MY CRUISE APPLIED THE BRAKES ON MY 2006 TOYOTA AVALON AS IT SHOULD.  I APPLIED THE BRAKE TO DISENGAGE THE CRUISE AND TO BRING THE CAR TO A STOP BEHIND THE PICKUP. AT THAT POINT, EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE TOTALLY NORMAL. BUT AT A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH THE BRAKE PETAL SUDDENLY WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY BRAKES.  (TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE). I MANAGED TO FIND A HOLE THRU THE TRAFFIC, BY ENTERING THE ONCOMING LANE, AND RAN THRU THE INTERSECTION (AGAINST THE RED LIGHT), AND MANAGED TO AVOID VEHICLES AT THE LIGHT BY TURNING LEFT 90 DEGREES. FORTUNATELY, OTHER DRIVERS AT THE INTERSECTION APPARENTLY SAW ME COMING AND HELD THEIR POSITIONS. THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED ROLLING ABOUT 100 YARDS BEYOND THE INTERSECTION.  I SHIFTED INTO \"PARK\" AND TRIED TO ASSESS THE SITUATION. THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RUN, AND WHEN I STEPPED ON THE BRAKES AGAIN, THE PEDAL RESPONDED AS NORMAL. THE LIGHT ON THE DASH INDICATED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS DISENGAGED, AND THERE WAS NO OTHER WARNING LIGHT NOTICED. I HAD THE VEHICLE TRANSPORTED TO SCOTTSBORO, AL BY FLATBED TRUCK. IT HAS BEEN AT THE TOYOTA DEALERS FOR THE PAST SIX DAYS. THEY CHECKED THE COMPUTER FOR CODES, AND TELL ME THAT NO CODES WERE STORED. THEY ALSO SAID THEY CALLED TOYOTA TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH A FAILURE OF THIS NATURE, AND TOYOTA APPARENTLY TOLD THEM THEY DID NOT. INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE DID TURN UP A PROBLEM WITH THE IR LASER SENSOR, WHICH WAS MISALIGNED, BUT THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT WOULD NOT CAUSE A BRAKE FAILURE. INABILITY TO STOP A VEHICLE IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE. HAD THE TRAFFIC PULLED INTO THE INTERSECTION AS THEY SHOULD HAVE, I WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE TO GO, AND AN SERIOUS ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED.  *TR",

WE LIVE IN THE OZARKS AND OF COURSE IT IS VERY HILLY.  I NORMALLY USE THE \"MANUAL\" MODE ON THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN AS TO DESCEND THE HILLS LEADING INTO AND OUT OF OUR SUB-DIVISION.  HOWEVER, ON 23 JUN I JUST LEFT IT IN THE REGULAR AUTOMATIC MODE AND USED THE BRAKES.  WHEN I SAW THERE WAS NO ON-COMING TRAFFIC, I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO GO---THE RPM'S JUMPED TO OVER 3,000 AND THEN THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD.  THANK GOODNESS THERE WAS NO ON-COMING TRAFFIC--I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.  I ASKED THE DEALER TO CHECK THIS OCCURRENCE OUT--THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE.  SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT I'VE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN ON 4 SEPARATE OCCASIONS--ALWAYS WHEN LEFT IN THE AUTOMATIC MODE AND AFTER YOU'VE SLOWED DOWN AND THEN PRESS THE ACCELERATOR TO GO.  I'VE READ ON THE WWW.EDMUNDS.COM WEBSITE ABOUT OTHERS WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING.  THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG AND BEFORE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OCCURS TOYOTA NEEDS TO FIX THE AUTO TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  *JB",

IN THE SECOND WEEK AFTER THE PURCHASE, I WAS DRIVING ON A RAMP TO ENTER A LIMITED ACCESS HIGH WAY. SPEED WAS ABOUT 50 MPH AS I BLENDED IN WITH THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. THE LANE I WAS IN STARTED TO SLOW DOWN AND THE LANE TO MY LEFT HAD AN OPEN SPACE. I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO GAIN SPEED AND TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL TOWARD THE LEFT LANE. THE CAR, INSTEAD OF ACCELERATING, APPEARED TO GO INTO NEUTRAL, THE TACHOMETER REACHED ALMOST 7000 RPM, THEN THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED INTO THE PASSING GEAR AND LEAPED FORWARD. I ALMOST HIT THE REAR END OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, BUT SINCE MY CAR HAD SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE I WAS ABLE TO STEER AROUND AND GET INTO THE LEFT LANE. I HAVE GONE INTO THIS DETAILED EXPLANATION TO DEMONSTRATE THE DANGER, AND POTENTIAL TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AT 50MPH THAT THE ??BUILT IN?? HESITATION OF THE 2006 TOYOTA AVALON COULD HAVE CAUSED. AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE, I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER, GOT THE EXPLANATION THAT THE HESITATION WAS NORMAL FOR 2006 TOYOTA AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. I TOLD THE DEALER I DID NOT WANT THE CAR AND WANTED MY MONEY BACK. OF COURSE THAT WAS REFUSED.  SO I??M STILL DRIVING A CAR I THINK IS DANGEROUS.  I THINKTOYOTA SHOULD MAKE A RETRO FIT TO CORRECT THE HESITATION PROBLEM.  *NM",
