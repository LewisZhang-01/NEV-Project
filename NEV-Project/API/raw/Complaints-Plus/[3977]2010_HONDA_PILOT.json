WHEN WE TOOK IT IN FOR OIL CHANGES, THE TECHS WOULD TELL US TO DO A GAS TREATMENT, SUCH AS LUCAS (THEY DID IT ONCE THEMSELVES), OR TO CHANGE THE AIR AND CABIN FILTERS.  WE DID THAT, AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. UPON EACH OIL CHANGE, THE DEALERSHIP WOULD JUST RESET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND TELL US NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG.  WE HAVE SINCE CHECKED FOR COMPLAINTS ON THE WEB, AND SAW THAT NUMEROUS CONSUMERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE & A LAW SUIT SETTLEMENT . WE HAVE CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA, AND NOW THAT THE RECALL IS OUT OF THEIR TIMEFRAME FOR REPAIRS, (ENDED 10/2017) THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PROBLEM EVEN BEFORE THE RECALL PERIOD ENDED, BUT ALL THEY DID WAS A \"QUICK FIX\" OF CHANGING THE SPARK PLUGS TO \"APPEAR\" TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN  UNEXPECTED \"SURGES\" OF THE ENGINE WHILE IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET, WHICH ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT THAT COULD'VE INJURED OR KILLED OUR FAMILY, WHICH INCLUDES 2 ELEMENTARY AGED CHILDREN. THEY NEVER DID THE SECOND STEP OF REPLACING THE PISTON RINGS IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTED, BECAUSE OF THE RECALL DATE.  THIS WAS BY DESIGN SO THE BUYER WOULD HAVE TO EAT THE COST ($2448 + TAX).

DEALERSHIP INFORMED CUSTOMER THAT THIS UNSAFE CONDITION COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR, VIBRATION & POSSIBLE LOSS OF CONTROL OF VEHICLE IF NOT CORRECTED. VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WILL COST $628.00 TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT BUSHINGS AND ANOTHER $98.98 FOR AN ALIGNMENT THAT WILL BE NEEDED AFTER BUSHINGS ARE REPLACED. TOTAL COST OF 726.98. CUSTOMER HAD NOT NOTICED ANY PROBLEMS, BEFORE TAKING CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. CUSTOMER HAD NOTICED WHILE RESEARCHING HONDA COMPLIANCE BUSHINGS ON THE INTERNET AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS FOR LOW MILEAGE VEHICLES. HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A COMPANY LIKE HONDA THAT PREACHES QUALITY CAN HAVE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF SUSPENSION COMPLAINTS ON LOW MILEAGE VEHICLES AND HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM WITH A VOLUNTARY RECALL. SAW AT LEAST 3 COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE ALONE, JUST FOR THE 2010 PILOT. ALSO APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM ON OTHER MODELS.   *TR",

THESE HOLES FALL FAIRLY CLOSE TO WHERE MY FINGERS NATURALLY LIE WHILE DRIVING.  TODAY, WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, MY INDEX FINGER GOT ENTRAPPED IN ONE OF THESE HOLES AT THE FIRST KNUCKLE.  THIS PREVENTED ME FROM STEERING.  I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND MANAGED TO EXTRICATE MY FINGER.  HOWEVER, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS IF I HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY TURNS, AND IT CAN EASILY BE FIXED WITH A PLASTIC PLUG.  ADMITTEDLY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE STUCK MY FINGER IN THE HOLE--BUT IF I CAN BE THAT SILLY, SO CAN OTHER PEOPLE. *TR",
