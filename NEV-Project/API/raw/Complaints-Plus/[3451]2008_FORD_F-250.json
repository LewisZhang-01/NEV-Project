WE FEEL THAT THE 20 INCH TIRES NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE RECALL AS WELL. THESE TIRES ONLY HAD 37,667 MILES ON THEM AND WERE PURCHASED NEW FROM FORD ON 7/23/12. THIS TIRE FAILURE NEARLY CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WHICH COULD OF LEAD TO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. I HAVE DOCUMENTATION SHOWING THE TIRES HAVE BEEN REGULARLY MAINTAINED/INFLATED  AND ROTATED.  *JS",

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A BUSY INTERSTATE CORRIDOR WHILE I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH WHILE IN 2WD MODE. IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, A DULL RUMBLE COULD BE HEARD, WHICH RAPIDLY AMPLIFIED TO A LOUD ROAR. I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY JOLTED BY A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION THAT EMANATED FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE. THE ENTIRE TRUCK SHOOK VIOLENTLY AS I PULLED OVER ONTO THE HIGHWAY SHOULDER. AS THE TRUCK LURCHED FORWARD HESITANTLY, A CLOUD OF THICK SMOKE BILLOWED OUT FROM BELOW THE TRUCK NEAR THE FRONT DOORS. UPON EXITING THE VEHICLE, I NOTICED THAT TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS POURING OUT THE TRANSFER CASE, WHOSE EXTERIOR WALL HAD LITERALLY BEEN RIPPED APART. LARGE GEAR COMPONENTS FROM THE TRANSFER CASE WERE STREWN ALONG THE HIGHWAY SHOULDER.    THE EXPLOSION WITHIN THE TRANSFER CASE CAUSED SEVERAL INTERNAL PARTS TO BE EJECTED WITH SIGNIFICANT FORCE AND VELOCITY. THE SIZABLE INDENTATIONS AND LARGE SCRAPES INFLICTED UPON THE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND THE PASSENGER FLOOR PAN, RESPECTIVELY, ARE A CONSPICUOUS TESTAMENT TO THE FORCEFUL DISCHARGE OF THESE VARIOUS COMPONENTS PARTS FROM INSIDE THE TRANSFER CASE. THE SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY CONTAINED IN THIS EXPLOSION NECESSARILY IMPLIES THAT TREMENDOUS PRESSURE WAS BUILDING UP INSIDE THE TRANSFER CASE. FURTHERMORE, THE THICK, ACRID SMOKE RELEASED FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION IS ALSO INDICATIVE THAT THE TRANSFER CASE WAS SUBJECT TO APPRECIABLE HEAT GENERATION. FORTUNATELY, AND RATHER INCREDIBLY, NO INJURIES NOR CRASHES WERE SUSTAINED WHEN THE TRANSFER CASE PRECIPITOUSLY BURST.

AFTER REDUCING MY SPEED ABRUPTLY AND NEARLY BEING REAR ENDED THE FRONT END REGAINED ITS CONTROL AND I CONTINUED AND ARRIVED SAFELY TO WORK AFTER REDUCING MY SPEED TO 45 MPH. I LOOKED IN THE WHEEL HUB AND UNDERNEATH BUT DID NOT SEE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY FROM PLANE SIGHT. I EXPERIENCED THE VIOLENT SHAKING ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND FOUND MYSELF EXPERIENCING IT MORE AND MORE AT LOWER SPEEDS AND ON SMALLER ROAD BUMPS/POT HOLES. AFTER DAY 2 I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR 6/30/14 WITH FORD SERVICE TO HAVE THE REPAIR & DIAGNOSES. THE NEXT DAY 6/27/14 WE HAD TO EVACUATE OUR JOB SITE IN LOUISIANA DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND POSSIBLE TORNADOS, ON MY COMMUTE HOME, THE SO CALLED DEATH WOBBLE OCCURRED AGAIN AND THIS TIME RESULTED IN LOOSING CONTROL AND CRASHING INTO A SMALL TREE BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND NECESSARY BRAKING TO REGAIN CONTROL.

I COMPLAINED IN WRITING TO THE MANUFACTURER AND ASKED FOR A FULL REPLACEMENT SET.  I RECEIVED A REPLY THAT BASICALLY SAID FOR ME TO WORK WITH THE TIRE SERVICE COMPANY AND THAT THE ONLY THING THEY WOULD AGREE TO WOULD BE A PRORATION.

THE NEXT DAY I WAS PULLING INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND THE TRUCK ENGINE DIED AND WOULD NOT START. WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSIS. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP COVER GASKET WHICH INCLUDES A WIRING HARNESS NEEDS REPLACED DUE TO WIRE ABRASION AND A SHORTED WIRE. IN ADDITION, THE CAB OF THE TRUCK WILL NEED TO BE REMOVED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART HAS BEEN RE-ENGINEERED TO INCLUDE A GUARD TO PROTECT THE WIRE FROM ABRASION. FROM INTERNET RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL SIMILAR INSTANCES, WITH SOME VEHICLES LOSING POWER WHILE IN MOTION. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. THE DEALER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS A RECURRING ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL OF TRUCK AND THEY HAVE MADE SEVERAL SIMILAR REPAIRS. AS A SAFETY PROFESSIONAL FOR OVER 30 YEARS, THIS IS VERY UNNERVING TO SAY THE LEAST.  HIGHWAY CRASHES OCCUR FAR TOO OFTEN DUE TO HUMAN ERROR WITHOUT HAVING KNOWN MANUFACTURER DEFECTS ADDING TO THE PROBLEM.

I BELIEVE THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT WARRANTS YOUR ATTENTION. THE VARIOUS FORUMS ON LINE WITH FORD TRUCK OWNERS CITES THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN. WHEN THE SHIMMY HAPPENS IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE TRUCK, PARTICULARLY IN A CURVE. IF I PUT COMPANY RECOMMENDED PRESSURE OF 80PSI IN MY TIRES IN AN EMPTY TRUCK, IT WOULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD RELATED TO TRACTION AND ALSO GREATLY REDUCE TIRE MILEAGE. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FORD CHANGED THE FRONT SUSPENSION DESIGN WITH NO LONG TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THEREFORE IS MARKETING A UNSAFE AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  I RESPECTIVELY REQUEST YOU LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AND ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WILL BE SINCERELY APPRECIATED. *TR",

THE TRUCK IS COMPLETELY STOCK AND HAS THE FACTORY TIRES, RIMS EVERYTHING... I HAVE HAD ALL SERVICE DONE AT THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP GARAGE WHERE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK. I HAVE TAKEN IT IN NUMEROUS TIMES AND EACH TIME THEY ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO LOW TIRE PRESSURE, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS EXACTLY 75 PSI AS IS THE RECOMMENDATION ON THE DOOR STICKER.  SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED IN ONE OF THESE TRUCKS.  THE DEALER REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM.  TO REPLICATE THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\", ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRIVE AN 08' SUPER DUTY AT 65-70 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE AND HIT A SLIGHT BUMP OR MINOR POTHOLE, ESPECIALLY IN A SLIGHT TURN, AND YOU WILL LOSE CONTROL AND BE SHAKEN VIOLENTLY UNTIL YOU CAN BRING THE VEHICLE'S SPEED DOWN TO BELOW 40 MILES AN HOUR.  I CAN REPLICATE THIS EVERYDAY ON MY WAY TO WORK.  IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY, EVERY TIME I GO OVER CERTAIN BUMPS ON THE INTERSTATE.  I NOW HAVE TO SLOW TO BELOW 45 MILES AN HOUR BEFORE I HIT THE BUMPS TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.  GOING THIS SLOW COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHERE THE SPEED LIMIT IS 70.  THIS REALLY PISSES ME OFF.

I HAD JUST PURCHASED THIS TRUCK BACK IN JULY BUT HAD NOT DROVE IT ON THE INTERSTATE, ACTUALLY I HADN'T DRIVEN IT MUCH AT ALL.  IT HAS LOW MILEAGE AND IS ALL FACTORY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ALSO THEY STATED THAT FORDS SERVICE RECOMMENDS 75LBS TIRE PRESSURE AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH IT.  THE TRUCKS STICKERS RECOMMENDATION IS LESS THAN THAT.  THE WHEELS ON MY TRUCK ARE STOCK FACTORY AND DO NOT HAVE LOW PRESSURE SENSORS ON THEM.  I HAVE RESEARCHED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS ISSUES AND OF ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES RESULTING FROM WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\". I THINK THIS MATTER SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THE PROBLEM FIXED PROPERLY BY FORD, NOT PATCHED WITH TIRE PRESSURE.  I PULL A TRAILER SOMETIMES WITH THIS TRUCK.  IF THIS HAPPENED WHILE PULLING ONE I AM SURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED AS IN OTHER CASES I HAVE HEARD ABOUT.  I AM SCARED TO DEATH TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK NOW.

I HAVE TWICE EXPERIENCED UNCONTROLLED INVOLUNTARY ACCELERATION WITH THIS VEHICLE. THE COMMON ELEMENTS OF THIS HAVE BEEN THAT IT OCCURRED AFTER A PERIOD OF EXTENDED DRIVING AT ABOUT 70 MPH, USING CRUISE CONTROL, JUST AFTER AN EXHAUST CLEANING CYCLE, AND WHEN I OVERRODE THE CRUISE CONTROL TO ACCELERATE TO PASS A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. WHEN PULLING BACK IN TO THE TRAFFIC LANE, THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE AND CAN BE CONTROLLED ONLY BY MAINTAINING HEAVY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES UNTIL A SAFE LOCATION CAN BE FOUND TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AND CUT OFF THE IGNITION. A RESTART IN NEUTRAL WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE RUN-UP IN RPM WHICH REQUIRES A SHUT DOWN OF THE IGNITION. THERE ARE NO \"CHECK ENGINE\" OR \"SERVICE ENGINE\" LIGHTS DISPLAYED, AND ACCORDING TO FORD DEALERSHIPS, NO CODES REGISTERED IN THE PCM. IN BOTH CASES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE (WITHOUT USE OF CRUISE CONTROL) BY PRESSING A \"RESET\" BUTTON LOCATED ON THE TOP OF A WHITE SENSOR LOCATED IN THE AIR INTAKE DUCT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. FORD SAYS THEY ARE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT \"MAKE A FIX\". I AM MOST CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE. *TR",

THE TECH SERVICE LINE TOLD MY DEALER THAT THE REAR INBOARD SEAT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN 'AUTOMATIC LOCKING MODE' AND LEO FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THE SAME.  FORD WAS FORCED TO CHANGE FROM A 'TYPE 1 LAP BELT' IN THE REAR INBOARD SEAT TO A 'TYPE 2 INTEGRAL LAP/SHOULDER BELT' BECAUSE OF 'ANTON'S LAW,' WHICH WAS SIGNED DECEMBER 4, 2002.
