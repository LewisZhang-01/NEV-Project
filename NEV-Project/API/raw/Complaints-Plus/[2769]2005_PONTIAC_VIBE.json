AFTER DIGGING MORE INTO IT THEY CALLED THE NEXT DAY (DAY 3) AND TOLD ME THAT THE EXHAUST CAMSHAFT WAS BROKEN AND RECOMMENDED A NEW ENGINE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF SLUDGE AND UNKNOWN FACTORS WITH THE CURRENT ENGINE. THE ESTIMATE OF REPAIR WAS $6100.  I CALLED MY MECHANIC AND HE SAID THAT HE COULD LOOK AND SEE IF THE CAMSHAFT COULD BE REPLACED OR IF THE ENGINE DID INDEED NEED REPLACED.  I HAD IT TOWED TO MY MECHANIC (DAY 4)  WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP I WAS GIVEN A BROKEN BOLT THAT THE MECHANIC SAID HAD BEEN THE PROBLEM.  HE SAID IT HAD GOTTEN LODGED IN A WAY THAT CAUSED THE CAMSHAFT TO BREAK., SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.\"  WHEN I ASK WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE BOLT TO BREAK HE SAID \"MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. THAT'S IT, NOTHING ELSE WOULD CAUSE A BOLT IN THAT POSITION TO EVER BREAK\".

THE CAR WAS OFF WARRANTY, BUT BEFORE I HAD ANY WORK DONE I CALLED BOTH THE LOCAL PONTIAC DEALER AND GM (11/4/2008-DOCUMENTED). EACH SAID THE SAME THING. THERE WAS NO KNOWN PROBLEM AND NO RECALL. SO I TOOK THE CAR TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AND PAID OVER $3200 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION. THE CAR STILL SHIFTED HARSHLY AND THE TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND A TOYOTA TECH BULLETIN FROM 2006 THAT DESCRIBED THE EXACT PROBLEM IN THE TOYOTA MATRIX (SISTER CAR TO THE VIBE-NUMMI PLANT). I ASKED PONTIAC ABOUT THIS AND THEY STILL DENIED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THIS WAS ALSO THE TIME OF THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE AND GM LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD GO EXTINCT.   NOW, IN SEPT. 2010, I GET THE RECALL NOTICE ADMITTING TO THE EXACT PROBLEM THAT TOYOTA DESCRIBED IN 2006. I WAS TOLD TO WAIT FOR THE SECOND LETTER BEFORE GOING TO THE DEALER TO CHECK IT OUT. THE SECOND LETTER CAME IN FEB 2011 ADVISING ME TO GO TO THE PONTIAC DEALER TO GET THE PCM CHECKED. I DID THAT BUT I ALREADY HAD THE CORRECT PCM FROM THE INITIAL FAILURE IN 2008.   THE FAILURE OF THE NOW RECALLED PCM CAUSED EXTREMELY HARSH SHIFTING WHICH CAUSED TRANSMISSION DAMAGE (METAL FILINGS ETC. IN THE TRANSMISSION-DOCUMENTED) WHICH LED TO A COMPLETE TRANSMISSION REPAIR JOB COSTING ME $3275.45 AS WELL AS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PCM.

WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES AND ALMOST AT A COMPLETE STOP,  THE ENGINE SPEED (RPM) OF THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY ACCELERATED CAUSING THE CAR TO LURCH FORWARD. THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED TWICE WHILE I WAS STOPPING AT A 4-WAY STOP INTERSECTION AND TWICE AS I WAS ENTERING MY GARAGE. HAD I NOT SHIFTED INTO PARK IMMEDIATELY DURING THE GARAGE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE STRUCK THE BACK WALL OF THE GARAGE. IF THERE HAD BEEN CARS PROCEEDING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION OF THE 4-WAY STOP, I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT. INITIALLY, FOR THE FIRST 3 INSTANCES,I BELIEVED THAT SINCE I WEAR A WIDE SHOE THAT MY FOOT MAY HAVE PRESSED ON BOTH THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT THE 4-WAY STOP INTERSECTION ABOUT 7 MONTHS AGO I HAVE BEEN EXTRA CAUTIOUS WHILE BRAKING, MAKING SURE MY RIGHT FOOT ONLY PRESSES ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WHILE STOPPING.  SINCE I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM AGAIN YESTERDAY AND KNOWING THAT I ONLY PRESSED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME OTHER PROBLEM GOING ON HERE WITH THE ENGINE/ENGINE THROTTLE SYSTEM. IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO DIAGNOSE SINCE IT IS INTERMITTENT IN NATURE.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IT IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO CONSUMERS.

THE CAR IS STILL PULLING LEFT, RIGHT, VEERING WHEN I BRAKE OR ACCELERATE IN EITHER DIRECTION.  THE TIRES HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED EVEN THOUGH THE GM DEALER THAT PROVIDED THAT OPINION REPLACED THE TIRES ON 2 OTHER VIBE OWNERS HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES BUT I DID NOT BUY MY CAR THERE.  I HAVE READ SEVERAL REPORTS OVER THE PAST WEEK OR SO ABOUT ONGOING VIBE COMPLAINTS REGARDING UNUSUAL WEAR ON TIRES REGARDLESS OF THE BRAND AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SUSPENSION AND SHOCK DESIGN ISSUES (NOT HOLDING THE TIRES PROPERLY TO THE ROAD).  ALL OF THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE WITHIN 12,000KM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS HAD I NOT HAD PERSONAL FAMILY MATTERS TO DEAL WITH.  LUCKILY THERE HAS BEEN NO TIRE BLOWOUTS YET NOR ACCIDENTS YET BUT ALL I AM TOLD IS THAT THE TRACKING IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THAT OF A VIBE..I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT ONE HAD I BEEN GIVEN THAT SALES PITCH AND KNOWN I WOULD BE IN FOR AN ALIGNMENT AND TIRE ROTATION EVERY 1,000KM.  READING THE INFO ON THE GENVIBE SITE AND ON THIS SITE BACK TO 2003, MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO THE TYPE OF SHOCKS AND SUSPENSION SYSTEM OR SOMETHING IF THE TIRES, NO MATTER WHAT BRAND, ARE BEING BURNED THROUGH THAT QUICKLY AND THE STEERING IS THAT BRUTAL.
