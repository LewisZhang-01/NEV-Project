IF YOU YIELD THAN A CAR FROM BEHIND SEEMS TO WANT TO REAR END YOU.  6-35 SOUTHBOUND DOESN'T SEEM TO GET LEFT, AND THE ON RAMP IS TOO SHORT.  I THINK ABOUT IT DAILY AND IT'S PRETTY FEARFUL.  I WISH THERE COULD BE A CAMERA OUT THERE TO SEE THE DANGER OF LACK OF ON RAMP.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE, THANKS.. *TR",
