HAD TESTED BY DEALER WITH SIMULATOR AND IT WAS THE ECM, I DID SOME CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL,TO MY SURPRISE NO RECALL BUT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE VANS. THE ISSUE IS: IF KNOWN PROBLEM AND THE REPAIR PRICE IS VERY COSTLY WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL? IN MY CASE THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT THANKFULLY, NOW HAD WE NOT BEEN IN TRAFFIC THAT WAS SLOW MOVING WE WOULD HAVE FOR SURE CAUSED ACCIDENT WHEN IT DROPPED IN TO LOW GEAR. THESE VANS A NORMALLY USED FOR FAMILIES AND MOST OF US CAN NOT AFFORD THE PRICE IT COST TO HAVE OUR VAN FIXED. I MYSELF DID ALOT OF CHECKING AROUND ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING TO FILE THIS AND DECIDED THAT WE AS THE OWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE VANS IT SHOULD BE THE MAKERS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO A RECALL AND FIX IT.
