WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK (A DISTANCE OF 26 MILES) I ENTERED THE FREEWAY AND GAVE MY CAR GAS TO MOVE INTO THE SECOND FROM THE LEFT HAND LANE. AFTER GETTING INTO THE PROPER LANE, THE CAR BEHAVED IN  THE SAME WAY AS A CAR AFTER PRESSING THE RESUME BUTTON, AFTER DISABLING CRUISE CONTROL. THIS HAPPENED AT 4:30P DURING THE START OF RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. THE ONLY WAY I COULD KEEP FROM HITTING ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS TO FLOOR THE BRAKE. AT ONE POINT THE CAR RACED TO SPEEDS OF 65-75 MPH. I COULD TELL THAT AT THE 75 MPH RANGE THAT I WAS VERY LIKELY TO HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. TO PREVENT THIS I BRIEFLY PLACED THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, THEN SWITCHED IT INTO REVERSE TWICE IN QUICK SUCCESSION. THE CAMRY MADE A HORRIBLE NOISE, BUT DID SLOW DOWN AFTER THAT. THE BRAKES SEEMED TO BE UNABLE TO ENGAGE PROPERLY FROM THAT POINT, POSSIBLY DUE TO EXCESSIVE USE. I WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DRIVE TO THE DEALERSHIP AFTER THAT. THE DEALER EXAMINED THE CAR, TEST DROVE IT AND STATED THAT THEY COULD FIND NO PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.    STATEMENT FROM SPOUSE:  AS A RECENTLY RETIRED ENGINEER FROM A LARGE RESEARCH LABORATORY, I'D LIKE TO ADD MY COMMENTS:  I SPENT 33 YEARS DESIGNING LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO RUN SAFELY AND RELIABLY.  OVER THOSE YEARS, I FORMED THE OPINION THAT LAB EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE DESIGNED SO THAT MALFUNCTIONS CAUSE ONLY MINOR PROBLEMS, NOT MAJOR ONES.      SINCE TOYOTA'S PROBLEMS WITH UNINTENDED ACCELERATION SEEM TO AFFECT VEHICLES OF VARIOUS AGES AND DESIGNS, I SUSPECT THE ROOT CAUSE IS NOT A SPECIFIC PIECE OF HARDWARE, BUT RATHER A FAILURE TO DESIGN THEIR EQUIPMENT SO THAT MALFUNCTIONS CAUSE ONLY MINOR PROBLEMS, NOT MAJOR ONES.  PERHAPS THERE ARE COMPONENTS OF THEIR VEHICLES THAT FAIL IN A WAY THAT GIVES THE VEHICLE FULL POWER, WHEREAS A SAFER FAILURE MODE WOULD BE HAVE NO POWER. *TR",

ALL OCCURRED AS I STARTED TO BRAKE IN A VERY SLOW-MOVING SITUATION - TWO DEFINITELY HAPPENING WHILE PARKING, COMING TO A STOP BEFORE THE INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, WHEN TOUCHING THE BRAKE PEDAL TO REVERSE DIRECTION OR STOP, THERE WAS A CONFUSING SURGE AS MY INSTINCT WAS TO QUESTION WHETHER I HAD TOUCHED THE ACCELERATOR RATHER THAN BRAKE AND THUS TAKE OFF MY FOOT - THE WORST ACTION.  IN ALL CASES, I HAD ENOUGH TIME TO REALIZE THAT I DID HAVE MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND PUSHED DOWN FORCEFULLY WHICH STOPPED THE ACCELERATION.   I ASKED MY MECHANIC TO CHECK THIS OUT, BUT UNLESS HE COULD REPLICATE THE SITUATION, NO DIAGNOSIS WAS POSSIBLE.  GIVEN THE RANDOMNESS OF THESE OCCURENCES, THE PROBABLILITY OF A REPLICATION IS PRETTY CLOSE TO ZERO.  THE ONE COMMON THREAD IN THESE INCIDENTS:  THEY OCCURRED FOLLOWING A LONG ROAD TRIP DURING WHICH I WAS USING CRUISE CONTROL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS, THOUGH IN NONE OF THE INCIDENTS, WAS THE CRUISE CONTROL ON.    I AM SENDING THIS NOW AS I LEARNED YOU ARE LOOKING INTO SUCH INCIDENTS AND THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT TO BUILD A RECORD.

TOOK VEHICLE INTO DEL TOYOTA(DEALER), WHO SAID THEY RESEALED THE WINDOW. NOISE FROM SAID WINDOW CONTINUED, AT HIGHER SPEEDS ABOVE 30MPH.  I TOOK VEHICLE BACK INTO DEALER ONE MONTH LATER. THIS TIME, THEY SAID THEY REPLACED THE WEATHERSTRIP AROUND THE WINDOW, THAT THE \"WIND NOISE\" HAD BEEN CAUSED BY DEFORMED WEATHERSTRIP.  THIS WAS DONE WHILE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY, NEVER TO MY SATISFACTION.  CONDITION EXISTS TODAY, 05/29/2002!!  #2 - DISC BRAKES WERE SERVICED BY JERRY'S TOYOTA IN BALTIMORE, AFTER MAKING A STICKING NOISE RIGHT BEFORE THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY STOPPED.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE FRONT PADS, MACHINED THE ROTORS, AND SERVICED THE LEFT FRONT CALIPER AFTER HE FOUND IT STICKING.  THIS DID NOT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKE NOISE, WHICH CONTINUES TODAY (05/29/2002) EVEN AFTER A SECOND SERVICING! #3 -  ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, SO I TOOK THE TOYOTA CAMRY INTO JERRY'S TOYOTA FOR SERVICING.  THEY CLEANED CARBON DEPOSITS FROM INJECTORS, THROTTLE PLATE VALVES AND PISTON RINGS; SAID THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE #3 CYLINDER.  THIS HAPPENED A SECOND TIME; I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICING.  I AM NOW WAITING FOR EITHER A THIRD INCIDENT AT $200. TO FIX, OR IF THEY REPLACE ANY FUEL INJECTORS, THESE COST $200. EA PER PART!!*AK",

I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO TWO TOYOTA SHOPS, AND HAVE HAD THEIR DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER INVOLVED, BUT TOYOTA CLAIMS THAT THE BRAKES ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE LINE PRESSURE READINGS ARE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS.  I HAVE NOT WITNESSED THESE TESTS NOR HAVE THEY TOLD ME WHAT THE READINGS SHOULD BE, SO I CAN'T BE SURE THAT THE TESTS WERE PERFORMED. THEY HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED A REPAIR, AND WON'T DO SO, BECAUSE \"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG\" AND IF THERE WAS, IT'S NOT RELATED TO THE WARRANTY.  THEY TELL ME THAT I JUST HAVE VERY GOOD BRAKES.  THEY WILL NOT ADDRESS HOW THE BRAKES CAN BE WORKING, BUT NOT WEARING.  SINCE I HAVE HAD THEM INSPECT THE BRAKES AT LEAST THREE TIMES, I HAVE PAID FOR AT LEAST ONE INSPECTION, THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO TAKE MY COMPLAINT TO ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WARRANTY.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE TOYOTA PEOPLE CAN TELL ME THAT THE FRONT BRAKES ARE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY WITHOUT SHOWING ANY WEAR.  THEY WORK BY WEARING.
