FROM WHAT I HAVE READ THIS IS A NORMAL FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE.  THIS ISSUE RENDERS THE MIRROR USELESS AND A MAJOR DISTRACTION.     WHY:  DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE MIRROR ON THE BIKE AND THE VIBRATION OF THE MOTOR ON THE MOTORCYCLE (THE VIBRATION IS MINOR).  THIS VIBRATION CAUSES THE MOUNT FOR THE MIRROR TO LOOSEN AND THEN THE WIND HITTING THE MIRROR CAUSES THE MIRROR TO ROTATE INWARD TOWARD THE RIDER.  THIS ROTATION RENDERS THE MIRROR USELESS CAUSING A DANGEROUS SITUATION BY CAUSING THE MIRROR TO BE USELESS TO THE RIDER IMPAIRING THEIR AWARENESS OF THERE SURROUNDING AND A DIRECT DISTRACTION TO THE RIDER AS THEY TRY TO SOLVE THE SITUATION WHILE RIDING.    SOLUTION:  REVERSE THREAD THE MOUNT FOR THE MIRROR.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE MIRROR TO TIGHTEN ITSELF DUE TO THE VIBRATION AND WIND.  BESIDES GLUING THE PIECE IN PLACE THERE IS NO REAL SOLUTION THAT THE OWNER ON THE PRODUCT CAN DUE WITHOUT REPLACING WITH AND AFTER MARKET UNIT. *TR",
