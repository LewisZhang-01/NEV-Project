        "summary": "THE TIRES ON MY TRAILER HAVE LESS THAN 500 MILES ON THEM ARE NOT PARKED IN DIREST SUN LIGHT AND ARE CRACKED IN THE SIDEWALLS AND TREADS AND THIS INCLUDES THE SPARE ! I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER THAT CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN , BUT THERE IS NO WEIGHT ON THE SPARE TIRE AND ITS COVERED ! THE TIRES ARE NANCO ST 205/75D-15 AND WERE BOUGHT NEW ON THE TRAILER 2005 . IF IT IS CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER IS THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF THE EARTH CAUSING THE SPARE TO CRACK ? DON'T'!@#$% ON MY LEG AND TELL ME THAT ITS RAINING  ! HERE IS NANCOS  800-227-8925 GOOD LUCK TRYING TO RECEIVE JUSTICE ! ALL I RECEIVED FROM THIS COMPANY WAS A \"STORY\" ABOUT AIR AND PRESSURE . THE SUN CAME UP ALSO, BUT THE TRAILER IS \"NOT\" IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT AND THE SPARE IS COVERED ! I HAVE A SPARE THAT LAYS IN THE BED OF MY PICK UP IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT FOR SIX YEARS NO CRACKS OR DAMAGE ITS A MICHELIN ! IT WOULD BE NICE IF THINGS WERE MADE IN AMERICA , AND AMERICANS HAD NO PROBLEM DOING THE RIGHT THING ! IM NOT EXPECTING MUCH FROM NHTSA THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS , AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY ! JUST WANTED TO HAVE MY SAY AMERICA . *TR",
