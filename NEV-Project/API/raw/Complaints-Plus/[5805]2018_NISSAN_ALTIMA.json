        "summary": "According to Nissan dealership My 2018 Nissan Altima CVT failed. They were able to determined the failed cvt with a diagnosis code P17F0. I have 73,694 miles on my car and my warranty ended at 60,000 miles. In previous years model of the Nissan Altima there were recalls on CVT transmissions for the Nissan Altimas. Nissan stated being that my car is out of warranty the only thing they can do is give me 50% good will because my VIN number is different from the other Nissan Altima that had a failed CVT. I don\u2019t feel that it was good will being that my car did not reach 100,000 miles and I\u2019m already having an issue that has been a problem In the past. I keep up with the maintenance of my vehicle very well and this problem occurred out of the blue. I also spoke with Nissan about the current recall on my car being that I have to drive a car around and my hood could possibly fly off at any giving time. Me being a Nissan customer with such a dangerous vehicle that Nissan continues to have issues with is more good will than they\u2019ve offered. I honestly would not recommend such an unsafe vehicle to anyone who is interested in purchasing a Nissan Altima. My car is fairly new and I\u2019m having CVT issues. My car literally stopped in the middle of the road and would not accelerate because of a mechanically failing CVT. I highly recommend that Nissan Recall any vehicles that have CVT issues especially since it\u2019s been a repeating cycle. I hope this doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. Thank you",

WHILE APPROACHING A RIGHT TURN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BECAUSE OF THE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS OF SNOW AND ICE ON THE ROAD, I SLOWED DOWN TO A CRAWL AND APPLIED MY BRAKE PRIOR TO AND WHILE TURNING.

THE NEXT MORNING I REMOVED MY TIRE TO SEE WHERE THE PUNCTURE WAS AND IF IT WAS REPAIRABLE.

AT 21,254K MILES THE PART FAILED AGAIN.  CAUSING MY VEHICLE NOT TO START (IT WAS START RANDOMLY).  WHEN IT DID START, I WAS NOT ABLE TO SHIFT MY VEHICLE OUT OF PARK OR SOMETIMES IF I DID GET IT INTO PARK, I COULDNT SHIFT IT FROM DRIVE OR REVERSE, CAUSING A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.  ALSO WHILE DRIVING THE CARS ANTI-COLLISION BRAKING SYSTEM, WHICH WAS INCORPORATED WITH THE SWITCH, WOULD SUDDENLY CAUSE MY VEHICLE TO BRAKE (EVEN WHILE DRIVING 70MPH ON THE HIGHWAY).  SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T GO OVER 30MPH.  I WAS ABLE TO GET THAT FIXED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE PART FAILED AGAIN AT 62,155K MILES AND AT 129,025K MILES. THE LAST TIME THE PART FAILED I ASKED THE NISSAN SERVICE REP IF THERE ANYTHING NISSAN CAN DO BECAUSE I CANT KEEP PAYING FOR THIS PART TO KEEP FAILING.  I NEED MY VEHICLE TO SEE MY DAUGHTER AND TO TRAVEL FOR THE MILITARY.  HE ADVISED ME TO CALL THE NISSAN CORPORATE, I CALLED AND THEY STARTED A CASE BUT THE NEXT DAY I WAS ADVISED THAT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.",

LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY THE INDICATOR CAME UP AND SHORTLY AFTER THE BLINKING YELLOW INDICATOR OF A CAR CAME UP AND STARTED BREAKING BY ITSELF, TWICE. THE FIRST TIME I WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 75 MPH AND THE DRIVERS ASSISTANT STARTED BREAKING. THERE WAS NOT A CAR IN FRONT OF ME OR AROUND ME AT ALL. I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY AND SAW NOTHING IN THE WAY OF THE SENSOR. THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED PROBABLY ABOUT 10 MILES FROM THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED. THEN, I TURNED OFF THE 'DRIVERS ASSISTANTS'. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY BAD ACCIDENT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR AROUND ME AT THE TIME. I TOOK MY CAR IN THIS MORNING TO THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM. THE SERVICE GIRL WHO I DEAL WITH EVERY TIME I GO TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. GOT MY CAR RIGHT IN AND FOUND OUT THE SENSOR WAS BAD AND IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND GOT ME INTO A LOANER VEHICLE BECAUSE I NEEDED TO GO TO WORK AND COULDN'T WAIT. I'LL BE PICKING UP MY CAR TOMORROW AND HOPING THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN!! NISSAN YOU SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL ON THE MATTER RIGHT AWAY.
