Gas was spilling out under pressure and when the tank was full. I replaced the pump... The problem is the old pump shows burn marks on the inside from the original connection. And it got so hot it melted threw the top .. Please help me fix this issue as I am afraid of fire. Replacing the pump is not going to fix the problem with your connection on top being wired the way it is... I have read many reviews online of chargers and Chryslers having this same issue and I drive my family in this car. I can not be worried about the fuel pump arching and blowing the car up.

The electrical connector on the top of the fuel pump (exposed by removing the back seat and plastic cover), had two of the five metal pins where the plastic had melted allowing raw gas from the tank to leak through the connector.  Gas would leak through connector when the tank was full of gas down to about 3/4 of a tank.  The gas would collect on top of the fuel tank in the well created for the fuel pump and retaining ring - the gas leaked through at a sufficient rate that it would fill up the well and then dribble down on the ground underneath the car.  The smell of gas in the car was horrendous, and when driven the gas would spread all over the rear underside of the gas tank and rear end of the car. There are many references to this issue on the web/YouTube for the Charger/300/etc - hard to believe it is not a safety recall especially since the leak is through an electrical connector that feeds power to the fuel pump!",

THEY SIMPLY ADDED THE PROPER & SPECIFIC FLUID TYPE THAT IS USED IN THAT PARTICULAR VEHICLE MADE BY THE CAR MANUFACTURER MOPAR. THIS SURPRISINGLY FIXED THE ISSUE TO WHAT I AM ASSUMING WILL BE A TEMPORARY RESOLUTION. BASED ON MY OWN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH & COMMON KNOWLEDGE, I HAVE DISCOVERED THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE. SOMEHOW THE FLUID IS LEAKING, OR SEEPING OUT SOMEWHERE FROM THE ALLEGEDLY SEALED STEERING SYSTEM. WHAT I DISCOVERED BASED ON RESEARCH, IS THAT OBVIOUSLY A SEALED SYSTEM SHOULD NOT LEAK, OR SEEP, & WITH IT BEING SEALED IT CANNOT EVAPORATE. MOST ISSUES W/THE VEHICLE STEERING PUMP HAVE BEEN LEAKS FROM AROUND THE 2 SEALS OF THE RESERVOIR FLUID TANK. A REPLACEMENT TANK & SEALS CAN BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY RATHER THAN ENTIRE PUMP ASSEMBLY WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE. ANOTHER COMMON ISSUE IS THAT THE \"RACK\" OUTER SEAL LEAKS. UNFORTUNATELY THE ATF+4 STOCK FLUID IS AGGRESSIVE ON THESE SEALS & THEY CAN/WILL BECOME POROUS OVER TIME & LEAK. ADDITIONALLY, THE PUMP, IT'S HOSES, & THE SEALS ON THE ENDS OF THE RACK ARE NOW KNOWN AS LEAK POINTS. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SHOULD BE RECALLED & REPLACED AFTER FIXING THESE ISSUES. IF THE FLUID BECOMES TOO LOW THE VEHICLE & ITS DRIVER/OCCUPANTS WILL EXPERIENCE A POWER STEERING FAILURE IN WHICH THE STEERING WILL SIMPLY SHUT DOWN & NOT PERFORM ITS FUNCTION - STEERING!

EVERY WARNING LIGHT WENT OFF FLASHING, SERVICE TRANSMISSION MESSAGE, SERVICE POWER STEERING , AND TACH, AND SPEEDO WOULD DROP TO ZERO , AND I WOULD LOSE ENGINE POWER, AND POWER STEERING. I CAPTURED THE INCIDENT ON VIDEO, AND PROVIDED THE VIDEO TO NHTSA, I WILL AGAIN PROVIDE A LINK FOR THE VIDEO HERE : HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/E96HVQPEP10  . IN DEALING WITH FCA LLC, THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE THE ELECTRIC HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING PUMP THAT WAS FRIED FROM THIS INCIDENT OCCURING. FCA IS SAYING THAT IT WAS THE \"2 YEAR OLD MOPAR BATTERY\" THAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT, AND REFUSE TO REPLACE THE EHPS PUMP THAT WORKED PERFECTLY FINE BEFORE THIS OCCURED. I REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR PER NHTSA RECALL NO. 14V-634 A GREAT DEAL OF TIME PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT OCCURING. FCA IS TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT HAVING TO REPLACE THE PUMP BY CHANGING THE ORIGIN OF THE MEANS TO THE BATTERY, INSTEAD OF THE ALTERNATOR. I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH HOW FCA REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE PROOF GIVEN TO THEM. I AM NOT ALONE IN THIS, THERE HAD BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS FILED WITH SIMILAR RESULTS AS MINE IN DEALING WITH FCA. IT'S TIME FOR NHTSA TO DO SOMETHING TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE WITH FCA. FCA OFFERED TO REPLACE THE $1400 EHPS PUMP IF I PAY A $500 CO-PAY, I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE MATTER. THE TRUE ORIGIN OF ALL OF THE ISSUE'S I'M CURRENTLY HAVING, IS FROM THE ORIGINAL ALTERNATOR THAT WAS IN THE CAR FOR A YEAR AND A HALF INITIALLY, AND DURING THAT TIME IT WAS IMPROPERLY CHARGING THE BATTERY THAT POSSIBLY CAUSED THE BATTERY TO ULTIMATELY FAIL ON 8/31/16.

I HAVE TAKEN IT BACK FOR REPAIRS 3 TIMES ,(FOR THIS PROBLEM), AND NOTHING HAS HELPED.  THIS IS A VERY NICE VEHICLE AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT AND ENJOY IT , BUT THIS PROBLEM IS SURE RUINING AN OTHERWISE NICE VEHICLE.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN VERY TROUBLESOME SINCE IT`S INTRODUCTION AND I AM WONDERING IF A RECALL IS PENDING?? IF NOT, IT SHOULD BE!!!!!!!  THE LAST TIME I LET THE VEHICLE WITH MY DEALER , THEY SAID THAT THEY \"COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM\", EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNICIAN THAT ALWAYS WORKS ON MY VEHICLES, ADMITS THAT HE HEARD AND FELT THE PROBLEMS THAT I DESCRIBE.  I MADE A COMPLAINT TO CHRYSLER AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME TO GET LOST ! THEY SAID THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER, (AT THE DEALERSHIP), SAID THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE, THAT IS THE WAY THIS TRANSMISSION IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE !!!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!  *TR",

THE OPERATION OF THIS CONTROL IS A SAFETY PROBLEM AS FOLLOWS:  FOR EXAMPLE, I SET THE SPEED FOR 55 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH CRUISES THE AUTOMOBILE AT THIS SPEED.  I THEN ARRIVE AT A 65 MPH LIMIT STRETCH OF ROAD AND SO I ACCELERATE BY PRESSING THE RES/+CONTROL TO ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE TO 65 MPH.  WITH ALL PREVIOUS CRUISE CONTROLS, WHEN I STOP PRESSING THIS CONTROL AT 65 MPH, THE SPEED STABILIZES.  WITH THIS ACC, IT CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE LIKE A ROCKET UNTIL I CANCEL, TURN OFF THE CRUISE CONTROL OR HIT THE BRAKES.  THE REVERSE ALSO APPLIES IF I WISH TO SLOW DOWN, REMOVING THE PRESSURE ON THE SET/-DOES NOTHING AND THE VEHICLE STILL CONTINUES TO SLOW DOWN.   IT IS POSSIBLE TO SWITCH FROM THE ACC TO NORMAL CRUISE CONTROL, BUT THIS PROBLEM IS STILL APPARENT.  I AM NOW ALMOST FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM AND CAN ACT ACCORDINGLY, BUT MY WIFE DRIVES THE VEHICLE OCCASIONAL AND SHE HAS PROBLEMS BECAUSE HER OWN VEHICLE DOES NOT OPERATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO THIS CRUISE CONTROL.  I AM SURE THAT OTHER OCCASIONAL DRIVERS FIND THIS PROBLEMATIC, AND IT APPEARS TO BE AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN IF IT HASN'T ALREADY.  I HAVE TAKEN THIS TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, AND THEY CONTACTED CHRYSLER.  INITIALLY, CHRYSLER ASKED FOR THE CONTROL HARDWARE BE SHIPPED TO THEM FOR ANALYSIS.  THIS WAS DONE BY THE DEALER BUT CHRYSLER INFORMED US THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  WITH MY LATEST VISIT I WAS INFORMED THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN THIS FASHION, BUT THE HANDBOOK DOES NOT MENTION ANY OF THESE CONTROL ISSUES.  *TR",
