This event of having something unexpected distract my focus and trigger a startled response while driving at a time the requires focus, attention, and awareness is altered in a way my and other lives are serioulsy at risk. II have almost been I near serious accidents each time this happens; I have gotten really lucky and that's only because im always on guard bc of my anxiety, cant say anyone else would be as lucky as me. The issue is the brace uses cheap plastic and also instead of making the piece that is known to break thicker they made it as thin as possible to save money most likely. the bracket should be completely metal in my professional option considering how much force the sun visor rod that plugged into it requires. No ones life should be a risk like this, nor should any customer have to pay $100 for a new retail cost of one that is unjust for a company to make a customer pay for a defective flawed part of there vehicle that should have been recalled long ago and never was. the first one was replaced under warranty when the Subaru dealer I went to was part of Nissan, then I bought one from the new store a year later, and then from the Rafferty store, and again this week from the new Concordville part store. (I dont have my invoice from the current part I just ordered)  There is more then one day of incident, one in 2017, one in 2018, 2019, 2020, and again this year 12/10/2021. cant find other invoiced.

It got fixed. I returned with the engine noise still in the car. In month 4 (08/21/21), again there was a safety sign on the dashboard. There was a oil leak in the engine. They charged me a huge amount of bill to repair this. Last Saturday on 10/30/2021, I was going to Walmart. I was on highway I-495 just a could of miles away from the exit, the car engine light was flashing. The engine sound gets louder. As  soon as I pulled the car to the roadside, the engine stopped and the whole car was full of smoke. My life was on danger last Saturday. I called the dealer on Monday (11/01/2021).

The fuel pump failure was found by my mechanic, and when I called Subaru to let them know that this occurred and that I felt unsafe, they said, well parts fail, your car has lots of miles on it and is fairly old, we can't do anything for you unless a recall is issued.   I was driving and pulled up to get on to a highway (55MPH) and in construction there is a stop sign. When I stopped and then tried to pull out, my 2010 Subaru Forester died immediately. No gas pressure, no nothing. All the lights flashed and then the car stopped.   I was in the middle of a big intersection and had to direct cars around me, push the car off the highway interchange and have it towed home. There were no lights/warning or anything that came on before the car failed.   Australia has recalled this specific thing for subarus there, but despite many other people having this same issue, Subaru of America is not offering to back up the safety of their cars -- even tho they are 'supposidely the safest on the road, in collision or driving'.

I now found that oil leaks and problems are common according to articles on line. It will cost thousands to either replace the seals or the engine!! For a vehicle of this caliber I expected years of services not immediate oil issues. This is a potential seizing of the engine issue. It consumes too much oil due to the leaks.

WHILE DRIVING THE CAR, I NOTICED THE COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED INTO AN OIL CHANGE SERVICE STATION TO HAVE THEM CHECK ON AND REPLACE THE COOLANT AND CHANGE THE OIL.  AFTERWARD, I DROVE THE CAR HOME BUT NOTICED THAT WHEN I WAS NEARLY HOME THE COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND I COULD HEAR A LOW WHISTLING NOISE.  IT WAS TOO LATE THAT EVENING TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER.  THE NEXT MORNING, ON MY WAY TO GET THE CAR CHECKED/SERVICED, THE LIGHTS FOR COOLANT, CHECK ENGINE, TRACTION CONTROL AND CRUISE CONTROL BEGAN FLASHING INTERMITTENTLY.  WAS ADVISED OF BLOWN HEAD GASKET(S) AND THAT THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  DEALER DID REPAIRS, INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF ENGINE BLOCK, WHICH TOOK APPROX 6 WEEKS.  THIS ISSUE HAPPENED SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING, IN A CAR THAT HAS BEEN WELL CARED FOR AND HAS RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE FOR ITS AGE.  THIS ISSUE RENDERED THE CAR UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT THE TIME IT OCCURRED.  I AM UNSURE IF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN FULLY RESOLVED YET AS I GOT THE CAR BACK AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON 2 DAYS LATER.  IT IS CURRENTLY BACK AT THE DEALER FOR ANALYSIS.

MY  MECHANIC PERFORMED DIAGNOSIS AND DETERMINED STORED P2441 AND P2443 CODES (SECONDARY AIR VALVES OPEN).    AROUND THE SAME TIME, OCTOBER 2016, SUBARU RELEASED RECALL: 16V-738. THIS ADDRESSES A SINGLE RELAY IN THE SECONDARY AIR SERIES. I PROCEEDED TO SCHEDULE AND TAKE MY VEHICLE INTO RANCHO GRANDE SUBARU IN SAN LUIS OBISPO. I ALSO OPENED A CLAIM WITH SUBARU CORPORATE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SR #:1-19856672948).   SUBARU BEGAN WORKING ON MY VEHICLE MID OCTOBER 2016 AND PLACED ME IN A RENTAL SUV.     I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM SUBARU, SO I FOLLOWED UP. THE TECH INFORMED ME THE VEHICLE IS READY TO BE PICKED UP MID NOVEMBER. I VISITED, PICKED UP THE VEHICLE, DROVE IT 3 MILES AND HEARD A LOUD SCREECH FROM THE SECONDARY AIR PUMP. I RETURNED THE VEHICLE, INFORMED THE TECH AND HE RUDELY RESPONDED \"WAS THAT NOISE HAPPENING WHEN YOU DROPPED IT OFF\". NO, I RESPONDED AND THEY RESISTED PLACING ME IN A RENTAL FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS.     LATE DECEMBER, I FOLLOWED UP ONCE AGAIN DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND THE VEHICLE WAS READY 3 DAYS LATER. I DROVE THE VEHICLE 200 MILES AND NOW THE SAME CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT IS FLASHING AND VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY ACCELERATED. I CHECKED THE CODES AND THE SAME CODES REMAIN.

WE COMPLETED OUR TRIP AT GREATLY REDUCED SPEED BECAUSE THIS OCCURRED AT NIGHT WHEN WE WERE UNABLE TO GET SERVICE, AND FINDING A MOTEL WHICH WOULD ALLOW OUR 100 LB GERMAN SHEPHERD SEEMED UNLIKELY.  WE DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN UNTIL WE COULD GET A SERVICE APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER.      THE BRAKES WERE SERVICED ON 3/1/13 BY THE DEALER, WHO HAD JUST REPLACED REAR PADS AND TURNED ROTORS 2 WEEKS EARLIER.  THE DEALER SAID OUR PROBLEM WAS DUE TO RUST ATTRIBUTABLE TO USE OF ROAD SALT, AND THAT THIS WORK WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY OUR WARRANTY AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE BRAKES SERVICED EVERY YEAR TO REMOVE RUST.  WE HAD NEVER BEEN TOLD THIS BEFORE, EVEN WHEN THE SAME DEALER SERVICED THE REAR BRAKES ON 2/14/13.      THE NEXT DAY, AFTER A 10 MILE DRIVE, ALERTED BY THE \"HOT BRAKE SMELL\", I CHECKED TEMPERATURES.  RIGHT FRONT STILL OVERHEATING.  NOW AFTER BEING SERVICED, THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE ROTOR RUNS HOT STILL.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK, AND AT THE DEALERSHIP, A LASER-AIMED INFRARED THERMOMETER SHOWS RIGHT FRONT ROTOR IS 147 DEGREES, LEFT FRONT 128, RIGHT REAR 82, LEFT REAR 97 AFTER 15 TO 20 MILES OF HIGHWAY DRIVING (AMBIENT TEMPERATURE 20 DEGREES).

FARRISH SUBARU REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE CENTER SEATBELT. WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I INSERTED ALL MALE HANDLES INTO THE FEMALE BUCKLES. SINCE I HAD NEVER RIDDEN IN THE REAR SEAT, I DID NOT REALIZE THAT ALL REAR SEAT BELTS HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN AN UNSAFE MANNER. IN THIS SITUATION THE TWO CENTER FEMALE BUCKLES WERE TOWARD THE OUTSIDE REAR DOORS, WHILE THE RIGHT AND LEFT FEMALE SEAT BUCKLES WERE ON THE INSIDE CENTER POSITION.     I RETURNED TO FARRISH SUBARU WHERE SERVICE CONSULTANT JACK LINDEMAN FOUND THAT MY REAR SEAT BELTS WERE IN AN IMPROPER ORDER. HE CALLED IT A \"BIRTH DEFECT\", MEANING THAT THE INSTALLATION HAD BEEN DONE IMPROPERLY AT THE FACTORY. LINDEMAN AGREED WITH MY ASSESSMENT THAT WHEN ALL THREE SEAT BELTS WERE BUCKLED, THE STRAPS CROSSED OVER THE RED RELEASE BUTTONS. THIS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE BUTTONS TO RELEASE THE BELTS FROM THE BUCKLES. I ASKED LINDEMAN TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  FARRISH SUBARU PLACED THE BUCKLES IN THE CORRECT ORDER WITH BOTH FEMALE CENTER BUCKLES IN THE CENTER AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT FEMALE BUCKLES TOWARD THEIR RESPECTIVE OUTWARD POSITIONS.    HOWEVER, WHEN I TRIED TO INSERT THE MALE CENTER HANDLE INTO ITS RESPECTIVE FEMALE BUCKLE, THE FEMALE CENTER BUCKLE FELL BELOW THE SEAT CUSHION. NEITHER I NOR LINDEMAN WAS ABLE TO RAISE THE FEMALE BUCKLE ABOVE THE CUSHION TO ITS PROPER HEIGHT EXCEPT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE THE MALE HANDLE CANNOT BE INSERTED INTO THE FEMALE BUCKLE WHILE THAT BUCKLE IS BELOW THE SEAT CUSHION. WHEN I ASKED SERVICE CONSULTANT LINDEMAN TO FIX THE SINKING SEATBELT PROBLEM, HE SAID HE WAS UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

NEW BUCKLES BEING SHORTER DO NOT COME OUT OF THE SEAT MAKING IT EXTREMELY HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUCKLE ANY ONE OR ALL THREE REAL BELTS WHEN A PERSON SITS IN THERE LET ALONE WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD SEAT IN PLACE.

IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS, THE SMALL CRACK ELONGATED TO MORE THAN 8 INCHES.  I BROUGH THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL SUBARU SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON FEBRUARY 8 FOR INSPECTION.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT THE CRACK WAS NOT A \"STRESS FRACTURE\" BUT DUE TO AN IMPACT.

HOWEVER, IN MY JUDGEMENT, THIS CRACK ORIGINATED AS A SMOOTH-SURFACED CRACK AKIN TO A DESCRIPTION OF A \"STRESS FRACTURE\".

I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE STEERING ISSUE AND THE SHAKING ISSUE. THE DEALER HAS BALANCED THE TIRES THREE TIMES NOW AND RE-ALIGNED THE TIRES TWICE. THIS HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE REMAINS.    CONCERNING THE ENGINE ISSUE, I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN THREE TIMES NOW AND THE DEALER HAS CHECK THE CAR AND STATED THAT THE ISSUE IR NORMAL. THE ISSUE IS NOT NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL. *TR",

THE FORESTER IS MANUAL AND THERE WAS A SHOULDER IN THE DRIVEWAY BEHIND THE CORNER I HAD ROUNDED; I APPLIED THE CLUTCH AND BRAKE WHEN I SAW THE VEHICLE AND RELEASED THE BRAKE WHILE CONTINUING TO HOLD THE CLUTCH WHEN I SAW THAT I COULD ROLL BACK ONTO THE SHOULDER DIRECTLY BEHIND ME TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE ONCOMING VEHICLE.  THE SUBARU DID NOT MOVE AND I BEGAN TO PANIC AS THE ONCOMING VEHICLE APPROACHED AND MY SERVICE BRAKE HAD APPARENTLY CEASED (THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE BY GRAVITY YET THE SERVICE AND HAND BRAKES WERE BOTH OFF).  I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND REVVED THE ENGINE UNUSUALLY HARD WHILE AGGRESSIVELY RELEASING THE CLUTCH TO OVERCOME THE APPARENTLY FROZEN BRAKE AND AVOID THE HEAD ON COLLISION, AT WHICH POINT THE BRAKE RELEASED AND THE CAR FLEW BACKWARDS TOWARD A STONE EMBANKMENT BEHIND THE TURN-OFF IN THE DRIVEWAY.  I STOPPED IN TIME AND AVOIDED THE VEHICLE EXITING THE DRIVEWAY.    I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF SAFETY FEATURE ON SUBARUS WHEREBY THE SERVICE BRAKE WILL NOT RELEASE WHEN THE CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED ON A HILL.  THE FORESTER I WAS DRIVING GIVES NO INDICATION TO THE OPERATOR THAT THE SERVICE BRAKE WILL BEHAVE IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY AND THERE IS APPARENTLY NO WAY TO DISABLE THIS BEHAVIOR IN THIS MODEL.   AS A SEASONED DRIVER WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES OF EXPERIENCE IN MANY MAKES AND MODELS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS I FIND THIS HIGHLY UNSAFE AND TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. *TR",

I TOOK MY FORESTER BACK TO THE DEALER AND THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT HE NOTICED THE DEFECT ALSO AND HE HAD ME COME IN TO HAVE THE MIRROR REPLACED. AFTER THE REPLACEMENT THE DEFECT IS STILL THERE, AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT SUBARU IS HAVING WITH THEIR MIRRORS AND THERE IS NO FIX FOR IT AT THIS TIME. I CONTACTED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE WEB SITE AND AFTER SOME CONVERSATIONS BACK AND FORTH I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S MY PROBLEM NOW THAT THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEM, AND THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE MIRROR. IF THERE IS NO PROBLEM THEN WHY DID THEY REPLACE IT TO TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM? IN MY OPINION IT IS A SERIOUS DEFECT BECAUSE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND UNSAFE WHEN TRYING TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY OR WHEN TRYING TO BACKUP USING A MIRROR THAT YOU CAN'T SEE A GOOD VIEW TO THE REAR. AFTER A FEW EMAILS BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REQUESTING THEM TO LOOK AT THIS FORUM SINCE THEY SAID THERE IS NO PROBLEM, THEY BECAME RUDE AND NOW, ME AND ALOT OF OTHER SUBARU OWNERS ARE STUCK WITH A DEFECTIVE AND UNSAFE MIRROR.
