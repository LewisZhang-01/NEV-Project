ALL OF THE SAME PROBLEMS STARTED AGAIN ONE MORNING WHILE HEADING TO WORK.  THEN IT STARTED DOING IT ON ME WHILE GOING DOWN THE ROAD ONE NIGHT ON A MAJOR HWY!! I HAVE HAD IT IN 2 DEALERSHIPS AND THEY BOTH ARE NOT SURE WHATS WRONG. BUT I HAD TO PAY THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND GIVE ME NO ANSWER!! THE LAST ONE TOLD ME TO JUST DRIVE IT AND WHEN IT DONE IT AGAIN BRING IT TO THEM AND THEY WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A VEHICLE FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND STILL NO ANSWERS. ALL WHILE STILL HAVING TO PAY SOMEONE TO TELL ME NOTHING, I JUST WENT AND GOT IT YESTERDAY FROM THE DODGE DEALERSHIP. IT ACTED FINE LAST NIGHT BUT ON THE WAY TO WORK THIS AM IT STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN WHILE DRIVING IT ON A MAJOR HWY WHILE RAINING, THE WIPERS WERE SPRAYING FLUID EVERYWHERE, THEN THEY JUST STOPPED WHILE ITS POURING DOWN. THE DOORS STARTED UNLOCKING AND LOCKING BY THEMSELVES. THE HORN DID NOT START BLOWING THIS TIME BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP UNHOOKED IT YESTERDAY. I HAVE GOOGLED PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND IT  ALL SHOWS A FAULTY TIPM. THEY HAVE RECALLED THE TIPM IN THE NEWER MODELS OF THE DODGE NITROS BUT NOT IN THE 2008S. IT WILL COST $900 TO REPLACE THE PART!!! I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS!! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THIS WHEN IT IS THE COMPANY'S FAULT THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!",

NOW, MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON SO I WAS ABLE TO TAKE MY CAR BACK TO THE MECHANIC. HE FOUND AN ABS BRAKE SENSOR ISSUE... BUT THAT WAS NOT CAUSING 2 OF MY 3 BRAKE LIGHTS TO MALFUNCTION. HE BELIEVES THE ISSUE IS WITH MY TIPM AND IT WILL COST ME A FEW HUNDRED MORE, JUST TO CONFIRM THIS WAS THE ISSUE. DODGE ALSO WANTS TO CHARGE ME A FEW HUNDRED TO LOOK AT MY CAR AND DIAGNOSIS THIS ISSUE. ITS VERY FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THAT THIS CAR MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF ALL THE ISSUES WITH THE TIPM AND THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO COVER THE COST. I FEEL LIKE I BOUGHT A LEMON. I LOVED DODGE BEFORE THIS.

ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO, MY BACK BRAKE LOCKED UP AND STARTED SMOKING AFTER MY VACATION WHICH THE HEAT SHIELD WAS FLAPPING IN THE WIND  OUT OF NO WHERE ON THE RIDE HOME AND FELL OFF WHEN I STOPPED(STILL YET TO BE FIXED). I REPLACED THE CALIPER, BRAKE, AND THE ROTORS. I HAD THE FRONT CHECKED AND THEY SAID THE BRAKES WERE FINE. 2 WEEKS LATER THE SHAKING STARTED AGAIN, AND THE FRONT BRAKE LOCKED UP AND STARTED SMOKING. I HAD TO REPEAT REPLACING ALL THE SAME PARTS. 2 WEEKS LATER AGAIN! THE FRONT BRAKE STARTED LOCKING UP SO HARD IT PULLED TO THE LEFT, AND WAS GLOWING RED WHEN I PULLED OVER. I TOOK IT TO DODGE THIS TIME, AND THEY TOLD ME THE BRAKE LINE HAD COLLAPSED. WHEN WILL THIS END AND ARE ALL THESE THINGS RELATED TO THE RECALLS? IF NOT CONSIDERING I DRIVE MY 4 CHILDREN IN THIS CAR AND IT IS A DANGER WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT? WHY DID THEY NOT TELL ME THESE CARS HAVE THESE ISSUES, AND WHY ARE THEY SELLING THEM AND NOT NOTIFYING BUYERS OF POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING PROBLEMS.THE COILS, AND BRAKES AND ALL ARE RUSTY LIKE A OLD CAR I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A CAR AS NEW AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF COULD BE THIS WAY.  *TR",

THIS HAPPENED AGAIN ON THE WAY TO WORK (THIS TIME THE RADIO TURNED TO FULL VOLUME WITH NO ASSIST), THE HEAT CUT OUT AND THE WINDSHIELD/LIGHTS/HORN WENT NUTS.

EVERY TIME I GO TO FILL UP THE PUMP SHUTS OFF AND THEN ABOUT ONE HALF OF A GALLON (MAYBE MORE) COMES GUSHING OUT OF THE TANK ALL OVER MY VEHICLE, THE GROUND, MY SHOES, AND WHATEVER ELSE MAY BE IN THE WAY. I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT IT IS A DEFAULT IN THE GAS TANK DODGE PUTS ON THESE NITROS. ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A SAFETY THING IN CASE THE VEHICLE WERE TO ROLL OVER. BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A HIGHLY FLAMMABLE LIQUID JUST POURING OUT OF MY VEHICLE AND ONTO ME AND THE GROUND. I AM NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE, AS I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE USED, BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FIXED WHEN DODGE KNOWS THAT IT IS A DEFECT. THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP!!!  *JB",

THE SPEED OF THE TRUCK WAS ACTING UP, SLOWING DOWN/SPEEDING UP UNPREDICTABLY, AND EVEN THE STEERING GOT REALLY HARD TO CONTROL.  AT THIS POINT A FEW MORE WARNING LIGHTS DINGED ON.  AS THIS HAPPENED, I QUICKLY PULLED OFF TO THE SHOULDER OF THE FRONTAGE ROAD, PUT THE TRUCK INTO PARK, AND ENGAGED THE PARKING BRAKE.  THE ENGINE HAD ALREADY SHUT ITSELF OFF.  AT THIS POINT I TURNED OFF THE TRUCK WITH THE KEYS, OPENED THE DOOR AND NOTICED WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  I PULLED THE HOOD RELEASE PREPARED TO INSPECT UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTICED A LOT MORE WHITE SMOKE THAN THE FEW MOMENTS BEFORE.  HAVING WALKED OVER TO THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK, I WONDERED IF IT WAS SAFE TO PUT MY HAND UNDER THE HOOD TO RELEASE THE LOCKING MECHANISM DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WHITE SMOKE.  I DECIDED NOT TO AND PROCEEDED TO WALK AROUND TO THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED FIRE. UP UNTIL THIS POINT, THE TOTAL TIME ELAPSED FROM THE MOMENT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WAS NO MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES.

ON 11/18/09, VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT DODGE DEALERSHIP AS ONE WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED HAD CLOSED.  AT THIS VISIT, THE BATTERY WAS REPLACED AS IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE SOURCE OF ALL OF THE ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN OCCURRING WITH THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS - HORN HONKING ON ITS OWN, WINDOW WIPERS (FRONT AND BACK) WORKING ON THEIR OWN (WITH SPRAY), DOOR LOCKS GOING UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES AND ENGINE LIGHT COMING ON, PLUS THE A/C HEATER UNIT STOPPED WORKING.  THE CAR HAD BEEN TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THIS REPAIR AS IT WAS NOT DRIVABLE IN THE CONDITION IT WAS IN AT THE TIME.  ON 9/2/10, THE CAR WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SECOND DEALERSHIP THAT HAD WORKED ON IT PRIOR FOR THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:  WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORKING BY THEMSELVES (WITH SPRAY), TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHTS INDICATING LOW TIRE PRESSURE WHEN PRESSURE WAS NORMAL, BOTH TURN SIGNALS FLASHING AT THE SAME TIME WHILE CAR WAS EITHER AT A STANDSTILL OR IN MOTION, FOR NO REASON.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT, BECAUSE NO CODES SHOWED AND THE VEHICLE PASSED ALL THEIR TESTS, NOT DUPLICATING THE PROBLEMS I HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I NEEDED A WARNING LIGHT TO APPEAR ON MY SUV OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP INDICATE TO THEM WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  NOW THE NITRO IS IN THE SAME SHOP YET AGAIN AS, ON 2/9/11, AS I HAD JUST STARTED UP THE VEHICLE, THE HORN BEGAN RANDOMLY CHIRPING, THE DASH LIGHTS ALL WERE FAINTLY BLINKING AND THE WIPERS WORKED BY THEMSELVES AGAIN.

ON 2/18/08 I LEASED A 2008 DODGE NITRO AT CRESTWOOD DODGE. ON 3/31/08 MY WIFE ROUTINELY STARTED THE NITRO, PUT HER FOOT ON THE BRAKE (AND NOT THE GAS) AND ENGAGED THE GEAR FROM PARK TO REVERSE. WITHIN A SPLIT SECOND, THE CAR MADE AN UNUSUALLY LOUD NOISE AND THE CAR BURSTED BACKWARD TAKING OUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF OUR GATE AND A PORTION OF THE FENCE ADJACENT TO THE GATE. THIS TOOK HER BY SURPRISE. SHE APPLIED THE BRAKE BUT THE BRAKE WAS NOT ABLE TO ENGAGE AS THE TRANSMISSION HAD TORQUED THE ENGINE SO HARD THAT IT FORCED HER INTO THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND THE REAR BUMPER RAMMED INTO A BRICK PILLAR SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE FRONT PORCH AND DAMAGED THE CAR. THE IMPACT OF HITTING THE HOUSE AND THE PILLAR EVENTUALLY STOPPED THE MOMENTUM OF THE NITRO. I CALLED THE SERVICE MGR AT CRESTWOOD TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY KNOWN RECALLS ON THE TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTIONING ON THE NITRO. HE TOLD ME NO. I ASKED HIM FOR ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO. HE REFERRED ME TO THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CLAIMS RESOLUTION GROUP. (CCCRG)  I FILED A CLAIM WITH THIS CCCRG. THEN WE RECEIVED A FORM LETTER FROM THEM STATING THAT THEY WILL SEND AN INVESTIGATOR TO SEE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE NITRO. CCCRG INFORMED US THAT AN INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED AT DEARBORN COLLISION AND THAT WE WILL RECEIVE AN ANSWER. THEY REFERRED ME TO THE CASE MGR. ON 4/9/08 WE RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THAT THE INSPECTOR FOUND NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTIONING DEFECT. I SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH DEARBORN COLLISION AND ASKED ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION. THEY STATED THAT THE INVESTIGATOR HARDLY LOOKED AT ANYTHING. NEVER EVEN STARTED THE CAR AND THAT HE WERE IN AND OUT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES. ON 4/10/08 I SPOKE TO THE CASE MANAGER AND DISCUSSED HOW WE CAN JUST GET A NEW LEASE. HE ADVISED ME THAT IF I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ARRANGE A MEETING WITH THE DISTRICT MGR THAT GOVERNS CRESTWOOD DODGE.  *TR",
