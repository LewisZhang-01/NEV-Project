I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED MY MECHANIC AND CONDUCTED A RESEARCH TO LEARN THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH INFINITI MODELS FROM 03-04. I DO NOT HAVE WARRANTY AND BELIEVE AN IMMEDIATE RECALL ON THIS PART MUST BE ISSUED. THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS ON LOCAL ROADS AND HIGHWAYS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
