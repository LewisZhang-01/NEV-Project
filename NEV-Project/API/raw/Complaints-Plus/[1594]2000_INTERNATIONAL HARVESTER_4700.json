THERE IS NO SMOKE OR OVERHEATING OF THE BRAKES, ONLY RAPID WEAR AND NO WARNING OF FAILURE. THE DEALER REPLACED THE BRAKES AND ROTORS NUMEROUS TIMES AND CHECKED OUT THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM. IT IS NOW AT MY EXPENSE AS THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME IT IS NO LONGER UNDER THEIR PROBLEM. NOW WHEN TALKING TO THE DEALER THEY DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF BRAKE PROBLEMS ON THESE VEHICLES. I FEEL THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS ON THIS MODEL TRUCK TO CAUSE SOME ALARM AND SHOULD WARRENT AN INVESTIGATION.
