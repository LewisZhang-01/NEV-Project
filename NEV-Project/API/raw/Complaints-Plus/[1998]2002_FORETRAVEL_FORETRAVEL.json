EACH INCIDENT CAUSED DAMAGE TO RV WHEEL WELL AND SKIRTING. GOOD YEAR REPLACED ALL THE ORIGINAL TIRES WITH THE SAME TIRE EXCEPT THE SPARE. I DO NOT TRUST THESE TIRES AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER OWNERS ON THE VARIOUS RV WEB SITES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. I KNOW THERE IS A NHTSA THAT STATED THEY CAN NOT BE USED ON EMERGENCY VEHICLES. WHY ON RV'S SINCE WE ARE HAVING THE SAME RESULTS? THE TYPE RV IS NOT LISTED ON YOUR DROP DOWN IT'S A SUNNY BROOK 31BWFS 2002 5TH WHEEL. SEVERAL RV DEALERS IN OUR AREA ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS TIRE ALSO.*AK",
