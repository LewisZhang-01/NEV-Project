THE VSA RECALL WAS not applicable to THE VEHICLE yet it CONTINUES TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. MY Mechanic advised me of a VSA code 25-1. I did a google search and found numerous accounts of this happening to people. My daughter was extremely emotionally impacted by this when it happened to her at freeway speeds. While the fix is replacement of an expensive component, there is no guarantee that it will eliminate the condition. I have been a loyal honda owner for over 40 years and find it unbelievable that the company has not taken ownership of this incredibly dangerous design flaw.",

IN DECEMBER 2015 MY VEHICLE STARTED TO GIVE ME SOME PROBLEMS, ALIGNMENT, TIRES, ENGINE, INSTABILITY WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING IN THE HIGHWAY. THE DEALER EXPECTED ME TO PAY OVER 1,000 DOLLARS FOR THE REPAIRS, HOWEVER THEY DID FIXED THEM AT NO COST. NOW JUNE 2016, ONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASE MY CAR STILL HAVING MAJOR PROBLEMS, TIRES, INSTABILITY WHEN DRIVING AND ALIGNMENT ISSUES. WHEN I TOOK MY VEHICLE FOR OIL SERVICE ON JUNE 2016 I EXPRESSED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS PULLING TO LEFT SO THEY RECOMMENDED AN ALIGNMENT I AGREED, AFTER 5 HOURS WAITING AND ME DRIVING AWAY THE PULLING TO THE LEFT WAS NOT FIXED AT ALL I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND DEMANDED THEM TO FIXED IT, THEY STATED THAT BECAUSE MY TIRES NEEDED TO BE CHANGED THAT'S WHY IT WAS NOT FIXED, MIND YOU THAT I ALREADY PAID OVER $100 DOLLARS AND THEY TOLD ME THIS AFTER THE FACT. NOW I RECEIVED A RECALL AND THEY HAVE NOT CONTACTED ME BACK TO EVEN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. HOW CAN A KNOWN DEALERSHIP PROMISED YOU THAT THE CAR IS RELIABLE AND INSPECTED BY A CERTIFY MECHANIC AND THAT IT WILL LAST FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND HERE I AM ONLY 1 YEAR FROM THE TIME I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE AND I AM HAVING CAR ISSUES THAT CAN CAUSED ME AND MY KIDS LIFE BECAUSE THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. I HAVE EXPRESS THIS TO BRANDON HONDA AND THEY HAVE NOT DO ANYTHING. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP?",

I HAVE REINSTALLED ALL 3 SCREWS AND USED BLUE LOCTITE THREAD LOCK AS IT APPEARS NO THREAD LOCK WAS PREVIOUSLY USED. I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND WAS CONCERNED THAT A) VERY SMALL DIAMETER SCREWS RELATIVE TO SIZE OF ITEM BEING SECURED AND B) NO LOCKING MECHANISM TO HOLD TORQUE ON THE SCREWS. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS OF VARIOUS HONDA MODELS WITH SIMILAR ISSUE ON INTERNET AT HONDA OWNER DISCUSSION BOARDS. THERE ARE EVEN STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS WITH PHOTOS HOW TO FIX POSTED ON A HONDA OWNERS DISCUSSION BOARD; YET WHEN I CHECK HONDA'S OFFICIAL TSB LIST - THERE IS NOT EVEN 1 TSB FOR THE TAILGATE LATCH LOOSE ISSUE; SO IT IS LIKELY MANY OWNERS (AS MYSELF) HAVE OPTED TO TAKE THE DIY APPROACH FOR THE SOLUTION. MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION IS THIS IS POORLY DESIGNED SINCE THE ATTACHMENT MECHANISM (3 SCREWS) TO HOLD THE LATCH BODY TO THE TAILGATE PANEL COULD BECOME LOOSE FROM NOMINAL IN-CITY DAILY DRIVING (PROOF THAT THE TORQUE ON THE FASTENERS IS NOT HOLDING UNDER NORMAL USE).  *TR",

THE PILOT WILL ROLL BACKWARDS WHEN IN DRIVE WITHOUT STOPPING ON AN UPHILL  INCLINE,  AND WILL ROLL FORWARD WHEN IN REVERSE ON A DOWNHILL INCLINE.      I LIVE NEAR SAN FRANCISCO AND DRIVING IN THAT AREA IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE IN AN AUTOMATIC THAT WILL NOT HOLD ITS GEAR.  IT IS WORSE THAN A MANUAL TRANSMISSION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE GEAR ENGAGEMENT WITH A CLUTCH. I AM FORCED TO DRIVE WITH MY LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND RIGHT ON THE ACCELERATOR IN ORDER TO AVOID ROLLING BACKWARDS INTO FOLLOWING VEHICLES OR CROSS TRAFFIC.    I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECT WITH NOT JUST MY VEHICLE BUT WITH ALL HONDA PILOTS PRIOR TO 2009, AS HONDA ADVERTISED THE 2009 MODEL WITH A NEW 'ANTI-ROLLBACK' FEATURE.     THE 2008 MODEL IS LACKING THIS FEATURE, BUT I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER AUTOMATICS OF ALL  OTHER TYPES AND SIZES AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.  IN MY RESEARCH, IT SEEMS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING CALLED A 'TORQUE CONVERTER' THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE RETROFITTED OR MODIFIED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.     I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE HONDA DEALER IN MY AREA BUT WITH NO SATISFACTION.      THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ISSUE.

AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS (MORE THAN 3) TO THE DEALER THEY COULD NOT PINPOINT LOCATION OF NOISE AND CAR WOULD NOT CONSISTENTLY MAKE SOUND. IN DEC. 2008 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE POPPING SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN. THE DEALER ORDERED AND REPLACED THE PART FEB. 2009. AFTER REPLACING THE PART THE DEALER TEST DROVE IT AND COULD NOT HEAR THE NOISE ANYMORE. I PICKED UP MY CAR, HOWEVER, AFTER DRIVING IT STARTED TO MAKE THE NOISE AND I LISTENED CAREFULLY OVER THE DAYS AND THE POPPING NOISE WAS COMING RIGHT BACK. I AM NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT THE DEALER ORDERED AND REPLACED THE PART. I AM CALLING HONDA MOTORS CORP. ON MON., MAR. 9, 2009, TO VOICE MY COMPLAINT THAT THE CAR IS DEFECTIVE AND POSES A HAZARD. I DO NOT WANT THE STEERING WHEEL TO COME APART WHILE I AM DRIVING. I NOTICED THAT THIS WEB PAGE POSTED A RECALL OF THE 2005 HONDA PILOT FOR STEERING COLUMN IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED. I THINK THE SAME SHOULD BE DONE FOR THE 2008 HONDA PILOT EXL IF THIS IS A NORMAL SOUND AS MY DEALER IS TELLING ME. *TR",
