Since then, the battery has been replaced once more and again died on both March 27th and April 1st. The car is driven weekly at least and has no warning lights on. After the most recent incident it was researched more heavily and found that there is a potential class action lawsuit against Subaru for this exact problem.

I then checked for recalls again and found that there was this exact same issue with 2015-2018 Subaru Foresters accounting for almost 370 thousand vehicles but apparently not ours. Obviously the car was no longer safe to drive as we weren't sure if the airbags would trigger in the event of the crash so we are paying out of our pocket to fix the issue but this seems like the old recall needs to be extended to cover other 2018 Subaru Foresters as well because from what I've seen on complaints here and on message boards, the problem is widespread. Hopefully, the NHTSA can investigate and see that the issue is further reaching than the initial 370 thousand vehicles. It's also important to note that 370 thousand subaru foresters between 2015-2018 is about half the amount sold in the US. If this issue affected that many vehicles on the road, it seems like the issue could be further widespread.",

For a few weeks, the SUV blames the problems on the battery in the key FOB being low, even though it was replaced on December 15, 2021. When replacing the FOB battery did not work, we learned it was the actual main SUV battery that had been drained. It is now March 19, 2022, and we are having the same issues despite having only a moderate amount of miles put on the SUV and only 3 months of time passing since we purchased and installed a brand new car battery.

        "summary": "I'm filing a complaint regarding a battery drain issue in the 2018 Forester Limited.  After sitting idle and not being started for 1.5-2 weeks the battery is fully drained. Fully drained is defined as the car won't start with a portable jumper.  The power source car needs to be running and connected to the battery of the dead Forester for upwards of 20mins to give it a partial charge prior to the battery dead Forester being able to start.  I've been told various reasons from various dealers and cannot get a straight answer.  [A] one subaru dealersip said it's normal to have a dead battery in 3days.  [B] another subaru dealership said it was because I had a bad battery, but after replacing it the issue still persisted.  I have made sure to manually shut off all lights including making sure the running lights are in the off position, not the automatic on/off position.  This incident has occurred multiple times when traveling for week at a time and upon returning to the car to try and start it and it won't start.  The same dealership [B] claimed that the parasitic draw was because I kept a cigarette lighter car charging adapter plugged in even though the car was off.  I have read several other complaints about this issue regarding this car and hope there can be a recall/legal claim filed against subaru for this issue so they resolve it.",

The vehicle is available for inspection and I have attached the photos for review.  The windshield has been inspected by a Subaru dealership who states they cannot repair or replace the windshield. The dealership suggested filing a claim with NHTSA and visiting their partner, Safelite AutoGlass.  A Subaru dealer and partner, Safelite AutoGlass, both confirmed that Subaru's defective or weak/brittle windshield is a known and common issue. The windshield malfunction appears to be a recurring problem across several models nation-wide with a lawsuit pending: https://bergermontague.com/cases/subaru-windshield-cracking/. Furthermore, this commonly known issue was not prefaced during contract reviews and Subaru warranty does not cover the damages. The windshield issues was not highlighted or recommended for coverage when purchasing insurance.  Safelite AutoGlass offered to replace the windshield with the original glass and confirms we do not have the option of choosing stronger or better quality windshield options. Continuously replacing a poor product with the same poor product could be dangerous if this continues to occur especially in the event it blocks visibility. Additionally the frequency of the problem will be burdensome especially since this car was purchased specifically to drive in harsh weather conditions. There was no warning, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to this occurring.   If Subaru produces weak windshields it should be a service covered under all warranties and/or offer better repair/replacement options.",

I turned off the engine and it wouldn't start back up again, therefore, I had to have it towed home. The next day I had it towed to a Subaru dealer.  It took them 5-6 days to diagnose the cause and fix. I was told it was a VERY rare occurrence; it was pinpointed to the fuel injector and coil, they went bad in cylinder #1. The parts were replaced with new ones and a new spark plug was installed as well. ALL codes are gone and the problem was completely fixed. Thankfully, the service was covered by manufacturer's warranty of 5yrs/60,000 miles power train.  For being such a fairly new engine, this problem should not of occurred. A defective fuel injector.

The crack began on the edge of the windshield in the upper corner on the passenger side and has continued to spread. There is no mark or indication in that area that the windshield was hit. The dealership mentioned when I purchased the car that I should get the windshield warranty due to an excessive amount of windshield cracking in my area. They claimed Subaru even did an investigation into Subaru vehicles in Michigan due to the high windshield replacement rate. It appears to be a defective windshield that the company is aware of and not recalling. The crack has spread across 80% of the windshield at eye level. It must be replaced for safety reasons but Subaru says this is over $1,000 as they have to calibrate it.",

The owners know their experience, but that knowledge has not risen to the level of public acknowledgement by Subaru.  The windshield cracked in 3 places for no discernable reason.  We had it looked at, and they are not deep enough for service, at this time.  However, we anticipate having to get a replacement windshield with estimated costs of $1000 or more.  Another discovery found in the forums, but not from Subaru directly.  The general public relies on the credibility of manufacturers and dealerships when making this long term investments.

Shortly after picking up and driving approximately 30 miles the car stalled twice at traffic lights. The engine was restarted but started to exhibit sluggish and erratic acceleration, especially from 0-45 MPH.  The car was taken back to Gwinnett Subaru the next day. They did some data retrieval and found a mass airflow event, cleaned the air filter, test drove the car, and released it to us. The next few days, the same problems were experienced but the car did not stall. At one point, at a traffic light, the car would simply not accelerate even with full pedal pressure which was gradually increased. When it finally did, it was uncontrolled and erratic. Highway driving once speed was reached seemed normal, but any acceleration from a slower speed was problematic. On Monday 6-14-2021 the car was taken back to the dealer due to serious concerns about safety and the possibility of the loss of power when critically needed or when on the highway. The dealer promised to investigate the problem further. That evening, we were informed that it was their assessment that the car would need a brand new CVT transmission. The car has approximately 41,100 miles and we were told that it would be covered by the 5 years/60,000 miles powertrain warranty. Expected to take 7-10 days for repair.",

The next winter, the same dead battery issues happened. It was suggested that I get a car starter jump pack, to keep on hand, which I used often. Then the battery stopped holding charge for even four days. So they recommended that I get a Trickle charge battery tender, so I did. The dealer thought it might be the remote starter, and replaced that. So far, it has been okay, but it is warmer weather now too. They also recommended that I keep the battery tender plugged in all time, year round, which seems crazy for a new car. I tried several times and ways to download my invoices showing these repairs.

IT SOMETIMES DOES NOTHING WHEN PRESSING ACCELERATOR FOR WAY TOO LONG MAKING IT DANGEROUS PULLING INTO TRAFFIC.  WINDOWS ROLL DOWN WITHOUT PRESSING BUTTON AND WON'T ROLL BACK UP UNLESS YOU ROLL THEM ALL THE WAY DOWN FIRST AND USUALLY IT JUST ROLLS RIGHT BACK DOWN AGAIN.

THE VEHICLE DESTROYS TIRES RAPIDLY AND UNEVENLY. GAS MPG IS TERRIBLE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU RUN AC.  STEERING ASSIST IS DANGEROUS AND WILL SOMETIMES JERK WHEEL AWAY FOR NO REASON CAUSING YOU TO SCRAPE CURBS AND NEARLY HIT A POLE ONCE..  BREAKING ASSIST IS ALSO DANGEROUS AS IT WILL SLAM BREAKS FOR NO REASON.  LANE DEPARTURE BEEPS A LOT FOR NO REASON.  WIPERS ARE GARBAGE.

AFTER SEVERAL EMAILS TO SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE, SUBARU STILL REFUSES TO ADMIT THAT THE WIRING HARNESS IN MY VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE, STATING ONLY THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 1/20/15 AND 8/1/17, EVEN THOUGH ACCORDING TO PAGE 3 OF WUM-98R THE HARNESS IS CLEARLY DEFECTIVE.   NOTE ALSO THAT PAGE 3 OF PART 573 SAFETY RECALL REPORT 19V-701 CLAIMS THE WIRING HARNESS DEFECT WAS CORRECTED ON 2/19/2018, AND LISTS 17 RECALLED PART NUMBERS, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PART NUMBER IN THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEFECTIVE HARNESS LABEL ON PAGE 3 OF WUM-98R (AND THE HARNESS LABEL IN MY VEHICLE).

HE POINTED TO THE BASE OF THE CRACK WHICH BEGAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BLACK AREA BORDERING THE BASE OF THE WINDSHIELD, CLAIMED HE COULD SEE A CHIP, AND DUG HIS PEN INTO THE GLASS TO ENLARGE THE CRACK. TO ME, THIS ARE LOOKED MORE A FLAW IN THE GLASS WHERE BROKEN WINDSHIELD MAY HAVE HAD A FLAW HAD FLEXED DUE TO THE FREEZING WEATHER. HE DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE AS A CHIP ON MY REPAIR TICKET, WHICH IS MISLEADING IF AN ANALYSIS IS DONE ON THE CRACK, BUT IT SUPPORTS THE TICKET'S NOTE THAT THIS WAS A 1-TIME REPAIR AT NO CHARGE, WITH NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE SIMILAR REPAIRS. THE DEALER DELAYED THE REPAIR DUE TO CHRISTMAS, AND THE CRACK CONTINUED TO PROGRESS ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. REPLACEMENT INSTALLATION SCHEDULED FOR 12/26/18. ARRIVING FOR MY APPOINTMENT I WAS TOLD THE WINDSHIELD WAS ORDERED BUT THE DEALER FAILED TO SCHEDULE AN INSTALLER. THEY KEPT MY CAR UNTIL THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED ON 12/28/19. THEY PROVIDED A LOANER CAR. RESEARCHING SUBARU WINDSHIELD CRACKS ONLINE, I LEARNED THAT SUBARU WINDSHIELDS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKING, BEGINNING WITH A 2016 OUTBACK RECALL, BUT FORESTER OWNERS ALSO ARE REPORTING CRACKS.",

THE INDICATOR LIGHT COMES ON RANDOMLY (INDICATING THE BAG IS TURNED OFF) WHEN AN ADULT IS IN THE SEAT - I HAVE HAD THE PASSENGER SHIFT POSITIONS WHICH SOMETIMES TURNS IT BACK ON; I HAVE PULLED OVER, TURNED OFF THE ENGINE, HAD PASSENGER GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND GET BACK IN, TURN ON THE ENGINE AND SOMETIMES THAT TURNS THE BAG BACK ON.  SOMETIMES THE INDICATOR SHOWS THE BAG IS ON (WITH PASSENGER IN SEAT) BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVE, THE BAG WILL SUDDENLY TURN OFF AND WE HAVE TO DO THE \"IN-AND-OUT\" DANCE TO GET THE BAG TO TURN ON AGAIN.  AT LEAST ONE TIME, THE BAG TURNED ON WHEN NO ONE WAS IN THE SEAT!  THESE THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES WHEN THE CAR IS STILL IN PARK (BUT ENGINE TURNED ON), AND SOMETIMES WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION.

CLEAR WEATHER, TEMP ABOUT 50 DEGREES F. HEARD ONE BEEP AND LOST CONTROL OF THE STEERING FOR A SECOND WHILE THE CAR STEERED ITSELF SLIGHTLY LEFT.  MY HANDS WERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND I WAS ACTIVE OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  STARTLING!  HAPPENED TWO MORE TIMES. TOOK IT TO A DEALER AND HE EXPLAINED THAT I MIGHT NOT BE USED TO ELECTRONIC STEERING.  THE SAME DAY, ON A TWO LANE ROAD AT 35 MPH, AT A SLIGHT LEFT BEND IN THE ROAD, ONE BEEP AND LOST STEERING FOR ABOUT A SECOND BUT ENOUGH TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE EDGE OF THE SHOULDER.  I WAS STARTLED AGAIN AND TURNED SHARP LEFT, CROSSING THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINE INTO THE ONCOMING LANE. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO VEHICLES IN THE LANE.  THE CULPRIT SEEMS TO BE THE \"LANE KEEP ASSIST\" FEATURE OF THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM WHERE THE VEHICLE'S COMPUTER TAKES OVER CONTROL IF IT DETECTS A LANE DEPARTURE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY AND COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT OR WORSE.  TURNED LKA OFF.",

I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE AND NOT NEAR THE LEFT LINE IN ROAD, BUT CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF LANE.  I HEARD ONE BEEP AND THEN THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME VERY LOOSE IN MY HAND AND IT TOOK ME A FEW SECONDS TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  THIS ALSO HAPPENED WHILE GOING ON A SLIGHTLY CURVED CITY STREET GOING ABOUT 40 MILES AN HOUR.   IT SCARED THE DICKENS OUT OF ME AS IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED THE LANE ASSIST TO DO.   I WENT BACK TO DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STEERING AND THEY SAID I JUST NEEDED TO GET USED TO HOW THE ELECTRIC STEERING WORKED.  AFTER IT HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIME I MADE APPOINTMENT FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE A TEST DRIVE.  THE TECHNICIAN FELT A SLIGHT SWAYING BUT SAID IT WAS THE TYPE OF STEERING OF THE LANE ASSIST.  HE SUGGESTED I TURN IT OFF AND NOT USE IT FOR A WHILE AND SEE HOW CAR THEN HANDLED.  THE TECHNICIAN FILED CASE # 26296330423, NO PROBLEM FOUND WITH VEHICLE, SYSTEM IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED, NO REPAIR ATTEMPT PERFORMED.  (EQMR WAS ALSO FILLED OUT AND SUBMITTED.)  I HAVE NOT DRIVEN MY FORESTER WITH THE ASSIST ON SINCE THIS HAPPENED.  I HAVE NOT HAD THIS LOOSE WHEEL STEERING HAPPEN AGAIN.  I AM CONVINCED IT IS THE LANE ASSIST AND FEEL IT IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY IN MY VEHICLE.  I WILL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT AGAIN.  LANE DEPARTURE IS FINE, DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.  I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WITH THE DEALERSHIP OR THEIR TECHNICIAN, THEY WERE VERY THOROUGH AND KIND.  THIS LANE ASSIST IS JUST AN ASPECT OF THIS SAFETY TECHNOLOGY THAT I DON NOT LIKE HOW IT WORKS.  OR IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT IN MY CAR THAT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO OTHERS YET?    I DO UNDERSTAND HOW LANE ASSIST WORKS, I DID TEST DRIVES HAVING IT ON AND IT WOULD BRING ME BACK TO MY LANE IF I WENT OVER THE LINE WITHOUT A BLINKER ON.",
