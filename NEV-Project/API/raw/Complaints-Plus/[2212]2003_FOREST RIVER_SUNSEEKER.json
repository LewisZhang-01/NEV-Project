WE CAN DRIVE FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES AND NOTHING HAPPENS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. WE HAVE HAD BATTERY CHECK AND EVEN REPLACED, WE HAVE HAD THE ALTERNATOR CHECK AND EVEN WIRES AND CABLES. RECENTLY IN THE PAST 2 MONTHS IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE. ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 65 MPH AND THEN AGAIN ON A BACK ROAD WHILE CAMPING. VERY DANGEROUS, IF WE ARE PULLING A CAR OR OUR BOAT THE DANGER IS GREATER. NO ONE SEAMS TO HAVE A ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THINKING THIS IS PART OF THE GCM IGNITION PROBLEM. OUR MOTOR HOME IS A CLASS \"C\" WITH THE GMC TRUCK FRONT.  *TR",

        "summary": "WHILE ATTEMPTING TO FILL RV WITH UNLEADED GASOLINE, THE GAS LEAKED ONTO THE GROUND AND CAUSED A SPILL OF APPROXIMATELY 2 GALLONS OF GAS. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE TOOK THE MOTORHOME TO A MECHANIC AND HE DISCOVERED THAT THE FILTER HOSE LEAKED GAS FROM HOLES IN IT. THE MECHANIC STATED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. HE HAS NEVER SEEN A LEAK LIKE THIS ONE, EVEN ON 40-50 YEAR OLD VEHICLES.    THE MECHANIC WAS NOT ABLE TO REPAIR, BECAUSE A HOLDING TANK MUST BE REMOVED TO ACCESS THE HOSE AND THE REPAIR WAS TOO EXTENSIVE FOR MY FAMILY WHILE TRAVELING. THE MECHANIC DROVE THE RV TO A GAS STATION AND FILLED IT WITH GAS, SO WE COULD TRAVEL HOME, APPROXIMATELY 140 MILES. THE MECHANIC ASSURED ME THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE TO DRIVE, BECAUSE THE EXHAUST WAS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND THE GAS WOULD NOT LEAK AFTER IT REACHED THE FUEL TANK.    I WILL FIND A LOCAL MECHANIC OR RV REPAIR SHOP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND REPLACE THE FUEL HOSE. THE MECHANIC ESTIMATED THAT THE NEW HOSE WOULD COST ABOUT $30.00, BUT REMOVING THE HOLDING TANK TO ACCESS THE HOSE WOULD REQUIRE EXTENSIVE MAINTENANCE. THE MECHANIC CHARGED $108.00 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. IF THE MANUFACTURER HADN'T ROUTED THE HOSE BEHIND THE TANK, THE MECHANIC WOULD HAVE REPAIRED IT IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  *TR",
