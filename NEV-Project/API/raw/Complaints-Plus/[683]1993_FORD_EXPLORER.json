I THEN CALLED THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT WITH THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND GOT THE SAME RESPONSE:  \"IF A REPAIR IS MADE ON A RECALL, IT IS ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES.  THIS HARDLY SEEMS EQUITABLE - GIVEN THE FACT THAT IF THAT DOOR COMES LOOSE WHEN SOMEONE IS FOLLOWING MY CAR - IT COULD  CAUSE A MAJOR TRAGEDY.  THERE IS NO SPECIFIC \"INCIDENT\" DATE - OTHER THAN THE DAY I FIRST HAD THE DOOR REPAIRED, AND THE GARAGE \"GUARANTEED\" IT.  I DON'T HAVE THAT DATE, BUT I'M SURE IT WOULD BE RECORDED ON MY VIN NUMBER.  IN  THE FOLLOWING SPACE FOR \"INCIDENT DATE\" I HAVE NOTED 12-01-04 AS THE APPROXIMATE DATE WHEN I  CALLED BOTH THE MERIDIAN FORD GARAGE, AND THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY.  *NM",

NO WARRANTY COVERAGE ON THE TIRE, EVEN THOUGH I HAD PUT LESS THAN 50% WEAR ON TIRE.  ON JUNE 13, 2004, WHILE RETURNING FRIM A TRIP DOWN TO LONG BEACH, HEADING NORTH BOUND ON INTERSTATE 5 IN CALIFORNIA I EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE TIRE FAILURE OF THE LEFT REAR TIRE.  THE TIRE DETREADED OR BLEW ITS TREAD OFF AND THIS CAUSED ME TO LOOSE CONTROL OF MY FORD EXPLORER ( BUBBLES, WAS THE CARS NAME SINCE SHE WAS CHAMPAGNE COLORED ).  I SLID BETWEEN THE LANES OF THE HIGHWAY TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF MY CAR. I DIDN'T REGAIN CONTROLL BUT ENDED UP ROLLING IT DOWN THE SHOULDER AND AFTER BOUNCING AROUND LANDED UPRIGHT ON MY TIRES FACING THE WRONG DIRECTION.

TURNED THE AIR CONDITIONER SWITCH TO OFF AND ENGINE STARTED AND RAN JUST FINE.  ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO BAD COMPRESSOR LOADING DOWN THE ENGINE. $900 LATER WITH NEW COMPRESSOR AND  CONVERSION TO NEW REFRIGERANT I ASSUMED EVERYTHING WAS FIXED. TRUCK IS 2ND VEHICLE NOT USED MUCH UNTIL WINTER. DECEMBER WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT, I ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED THE HEATER SWITCH IN, (AIR-CONDITIONER ON MODE) AND THE ENGINE INSTANTLY SHUT OFF, AS WELL AS ALL THE LIGHTS AND THE HORN.  RESET THE SWITCH AND ONCE AGAIN EVERYTHING WAS FINE. NEVER BLEW A FUSE! EXPECTED A WIRE HARNESS FIRE AFTER THAT! I'D EXPECT THE LOAD LINE TO THE COMPRESSOR TO BE ON A SEPARATE CIRCUIT AND ISOLATED BY A FUSE LINK OR REPLACEABLE FUSE! REPLACED THE $95 SWITCH AND INSPECTED IT. IT WAS ALL MELTED INSIDE.    I WONDER IF THE SWITCH WAS THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND THE COMPRESSOR WAS ACTUALLY GOOD SINCE THE AIR WAS COLD WHEN IT WAS RUNNING. COULD IT GO FROM GOOD TO INSTANTLY SEIZED? COULD THE CIRCUITRY IN THE EXPLORER SPORT ALLOW A LARGE CURRENT DRAW TO MELT THE SWITCH? IF SO FORD OWES ME FOR THE COMPRESSOR AND LABOR. CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY A FUSELINK OR FUSE DIDN'T BLOW. ONLY A DEAD SHORT WOULD KNOCK OUT THE LIGHTS, AND HORN. LUCKILY THE SWITCH COULD BE SWITCHED OFF, AS I ROLLED TO A STOP.       SECOND ITEM TO REPORT WAS THAT WHILE REPLACING THE BAD  RESISTOR COILS FOR FAN'S SPEED CONTROL, THE HEATER ENCLOSURE WAS PACKED WITH LEAVES- VERY DANGEROUS. VACUUMED EVERYTHING OUT. NEED TO FIND OUT WHY THERE IS NO SCREEN SOMEWHERE. *AK",

WE EXAMINED THE DAMAGE, THERE WAS SOME SMALL AMOUNT OF BODY DAMAGE, BUT THE TIRE, STILL INFLATED, HAD NO TREAD.

IN NOVEMBER WE TOOK OUR VEHICLE TO DISCOUNT TIRE TO HAVE THE OTHER 3 TIRES REPLACE AND WERE TOLD THAT THEY ALL SHOWED TREAD SEPARATION AND WE WERE LUCKY.  CURRENTLY, WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE FIRESTONE TIRES AS A SPARE AS IT SHOWED THE LEAST TO NO SEPARATION.  THE DOT # I PROVIDED IS FROM THE SPARE.  I DO NOT HAVE THE NUMBER OFF OF THE ACTUAL DEFECTIVE TIRE.  NO REPORTS FILED SINCE THERE WAS, THANKFULLY, NO SERIOUS ACCIDENT.

I FELT MY CAR JERK AND THEN FELT MY TIRE WAS FLAT.  UPON EXAIMING THE FLAT TIRE I OBSERVED THAT THE TREAD HAD PEELED PARTLY OFF.  AT THE TIME I WAS UNAWARE THAT MY TIRE WAS PRONE TO THIS TYPE OF FAILURE.  I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED WITH A UNIROYAL.  UP TO THIS POINT I HAD BEEN TOTALLY UNSATISFIED WITH MY TIRES. THEY HANDLE POORLY IN WET CONDITIONS AND ARE NOISEY.  RECENTLY THE SHAKING BECAME MORE FREQUENT.  I HAD THE SHOCKS REPLACED THINKING THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.  THE SHAKING CONTINUED.  AND LAST WEEK I STARTED READING THE FIRST STORIES ABOUT MY TIRES.  UPON EXAIMING MY TIRES, IT WAS QUITE APPARENT THAT TREAD FAILURE WAS THE PROBLEM.  I OBSERVED A LARGE CRACK ALL THE WAY AROUND THE TIRE TREAD ON ALL THE OF MY FIRESTONE TIRES AND THE SPARE.  I DOCUMENTED THIS ALL WITH PHOTOGRAPHS.  I WAS IN A BIND ABOUT WHAT TO DO.  I GO BACK TO COLLEGE THIS COMING FRIDAY, THE 18TH.  THIS WILL INVOLVE A LONG DRIVE AT HIGH SPEEDS AND CARRYING HEAVY LOADS. I REALIZED I NEED TO HAVE MY TIRES REPLACED ASAP.  I BEGAN LOOKING AT TIRES AND BECAME CONCERNED THAT I, A CASH-STRAPPED COLLEGE STUDENT, WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE RELATIVLY  NEW TIRES BECAUSE OF A MANUFACTURE'S DEFECT.  LUCKY A RECALL WAS ISSUED, BUT THIS HAS DONE LITTLE TO RESOLVE MY PROBLEM.  WITH MY MOVE-IN DAY RAPIDLY APPROACHING I HAVE BEEN PLACED ON A WAITING LIST FOR TIRES.

IT DIES AT STOP SIGNS OR WHEN TRYING TO START IT UP. IT SURGES WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND FEELS LIKE A TUGGING MOTION. THE RPMS AND AMPS GO WAY DOWN AND FEELS LIKE IT MAY STALL THEN IT SURGES AND GETS POWER. WHEN IT GETS POWER IT ALMOST JUMPS FORWARD AND HITS THE CAR IN FRONT WHILE MY FOOT IS STILL ON THE BREAK. IT ALSO JUMPS AROUND AT STOP SIGNS WITH THE RPMS AND AMPS GOING UP AND DOWN. MOSSEY FORD IN SAN DIEGO, CA HAS REPLACED THE OIL AND FILTER AND THE FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR. THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE CAR OF THE PROBLEM AND IT DID NOT. THE PROBLEM BECAME MORE DOMINANT, PERSISTENT, AND DANGEROUS. THIS WORK COST APPROXIMATELY $300.00, SO DUE TO HIGH COST AT FORD. I TOOK THE VEHICAL TO GREG'S AUTOMOTIVE IN EL CAJON, CA. I THEN REPLACED THE BATTERY AND WAS CHARGED USELESSLY FOR FINDING NO PROBLEMS. AT THIS POINT, I SPEND ABOUT $400.00 MORE DOLLARS FOR NOTHING. THEY HAD A HUNCH THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE TIMING BELT, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $600.00 JUST FOR THEM TO CHECK. I HAVE BEEN SPENDING HARD EARNED MONEY USELESSLY AND DISREGARDING MY BILLS FOR MY VEHICAL NOT BEING FIXED. I AM SCARED FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHER'S SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THE EXPLORER UNDER THESE UNFIXABLE CONDITIONS. I NEED HELP AND HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO PIN POINT THE EXACT PROBLEM. I DEPEND ON MY VEHICAL AND MUST USE IT TO GET ME PLACES I HAVE TO GO. MY FORD VEHICAL IS STALLING, DIEING, AND SURGING.

HE SAID THERE WAS NO KNOWN RECALL FOR THE HANDLE AND THE PRICE TO REPLACE IT WAS ABOUT $600.00  I CALLED THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE BUREAU AND LEARNED THE SAME.  THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO HELP ANY FURTHER.  I ENDED UP PURCHASING ANOTHER PANEL FOR $200.00 FROM A USED PARTS DEALER.  THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED ON 10/03/98 WITH THE LEFT FRONT DOOR HANDLE.    IT IS OBVIOUS TO ALL PERSONS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THIS VEHICLE (CUSTOMERS, DEALERS, AND REPAIR SPECIALISTS) THAT THIS IS A KNOWN HAZARD AND DEFECT.
