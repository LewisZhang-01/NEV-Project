After an hour and a half, I started the vehicle back up and not to my surprise experienced the puttering and shaking once again. I put the vehicle in drive and began to slowly step on the gas while turning into the road and the car shut completely off and slid back toward the curb with the engine light on and battery.  I had to call AAA to have me towed home and on their arrival, they were able to back the vehicle up and forward as long as he pushed down full throttle.  The AAA representative suggested through his knowledge of mechanics that it seems there is an issue with either the spark plugs or the fuel pump/filter combo. After changing the spark plugs and still having this issue tonight....we are leaning towards the pump as the issue. There were no lights or warnings prior to the shaking that began as stated in this entry.",
