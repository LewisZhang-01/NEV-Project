THIS MODULE CONTROLS MULTIPLE BRAKE-RELATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THE ABS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR WINTER DRIVING, BUT THE MOST CRITICAL FUNCTION OF THIS MODULE IS PROBABLY THE ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION, OR EBD. THESE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF THE EBD IS INOPERATIVE, THE PROPORTION OF HYDRAULIC FORCE APPLIED TO THE REAR BRAKES DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING IS AS GREAT AS IT IS DURING MODERATE BRAKING EFFORT WHEN THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFER OF VEHICLE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT WHEELS. THE EBD IS SUPPOSED TO ADJUST THE FRONT/REAR BRAKING DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICALLY ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF THE DECELERATION, SO THAT THE REAR WHEELS WILL NOT LOCK UP DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING. IF THIS MODULE SHOULD FAIL DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING ON DRY PAVEMENT, THE REAR WHEELS COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD EASILY INCLUDE FATALITIES. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR OWNERS, COSTING ROUGHLY $2000, AND MANY OWNERS HAVE PROBABLY PUT OFF THE REPAIR INDEFINITELY.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ON MARCH 21, 2005. THE DEALER PERFORMED DIAGNOSIS AND DETERMINED THE ABS PUMP NEEDED REPLACING.  THE DEALER (NEW CENTURY VOLKSWAGEN IN GLENDALE, CA) QUOTED A PRICE OF $3125, PARTS AND LABOR, TO FIX.   I AM UNABLE TO REPAIR THE CAR AT THIS TIME DUE TO THE EXPENSE.    RESEARCH ONLINE AND IN DISCUSSING WITH INDEPENDENT VW MECHANICS REVEALS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL VW.  I CHECKED WITH AN INDEPENDENT VW MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM THAT THE PRICE OF ABS USED PARTS IS RAPIDLY RISING.
