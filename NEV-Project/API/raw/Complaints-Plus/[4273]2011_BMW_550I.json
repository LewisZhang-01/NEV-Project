I WAS ACCELERATING ON A BUSY FREEWAY RAMP WITH MY TWO YOUNG SONS ABOARD, AND MY CAR WENT INTO LIMP MODE. THIS PUT US IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION WHEN AT THE MOMENT I NEEDED BRISK ACCELERATION, MY CAR WAS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE EVEN 40MPH. IT ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.     I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GET THIS ISSUE SERVICED AT BMW OF SAN FRANCISCO SINCE THIS IS MY DAILY DRIVER.       WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE THE BILL CAME TO A LITTLE OVER $2100 WHICH INCLUDED ABOUT $450 IN DIAGNOSTICS. NOW THAT THE DUST HAS HAD A CHANCE TO SETTLE, I'D LIKE SOME RECOMPENSE ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES.     'THE HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP FAILURE IS SAFETY RELATED AND SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE SAME WARRANTY AS THE LOW-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP WHICH CARRIES AN EXTENDED 10-YEAR WARRANTY ON THESE CARS AND, WHICH ALSO HAS A TENDENCY TO FAIL AT INOPPORTUNE MOMENTS  'IN CLOSING, THIS CAR WAS ALWAYS SERVICED AT THE DEALER, AND WENT THROUGH THE CUSTOMER CARE PROGRAM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

I WAS APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION.  I ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE AND THE GAS PEDAL WAS NON-RESPONSIVE.  THE VEHICLE THEN INDICATED THAT IT HAD A DRIVETRAIN MALFUNCTION. I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER, TURN THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON AND DRIVE 0.5 MILES TO MY DESTINATION.  WHILE PARKED, THE PARKING BRAKE ALSO MALFUNCTIONED AND I WAS UNABLE TO TURN IT OFF.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.    THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DESIGN DEFICIENCY WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR HAD TO DO WITH A BROKEN PLASTIC PART ON THE WATER CHANNEL THAT LEADS AROUND THE TRUNK.  THE PLASTIC COVER IS SUPPOSED TO SNAP INTO A GROMMET THAT IS IN A HOLE, THUS SEALING THE HOLE FROM WATER.  IN MY SITUATION, THE GROMMET WAS MISSING. GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PLASTIC PART, THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITHOUT REMOVING THE PLASTIC PART.  THE HOLE THAT THE PLASTIC PIECE SNAPS INTO LEADS DIRECTLY INTO THE TRUNK. IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUNK ARE SENSITIVE ELECTRONIC MODULES THAT CONTROL THE FUEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND THE PARKING BRAKE.  THERE IS NO DRAIN IN THE TRUNK THAT WOULD ALLOW WATER TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE.     MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN A PARKING LOT DURING A RAIN STORM.  AS A RESULT OF THE DESIGN, I GOT WATER IN THE TRUNK, WHICH RUINED THESE TWO MODULES, RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE BECOMING DISABLED WHILE DRIVING.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: I) AS A CONSUMER, I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE ELECTRONICS THAT ENABLE THE VEHICLE TO MANAGE FUEL WERE LOCATED IN THE TRUNK; II) THE DESIGN OF THE WATER CHANNEL AROUND THE TRUNK SEEMS INADEQUATE GIVEN THAT ANY FAILURE OF THE PLASTIC SHIELD / GROMMET COMBINATION WOULD LEAD TO WATER IN THE TRUNK AND EXPOSE THESE CRITICAL COMPONENTS.  *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME TO REPLACE ALL TIRES. AT THAT TIME, I CHOSE TO JUST REPLACE THE REAR. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY A THE CAR BEING BADLY OUT OF ALIGNMENT. THEREFORE, I HAD MY 2011 BMW 550I X GT GIVEN AN ALIGNMENT.   WHEN I LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE TIRE THAT WAS SHOWING THE CORDS I COULD SEE THAT THE TREAD WAS SEPARATING FROM THE BODY OF THE TIRE. IF THAT TIRE OR ANY OF THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE HAD THE CORD SEPARATE IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A VERY BAD ACCIDENT. THE ALIGNMENT WAS OK, ONLY THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE OUT BY 0.01 DEGREE. I CALLED GOODYEAR AND I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEN. WHEN I TOLD THEM THE TREAD WAS TRYING TO SEPARATE THE AGENT PUT ME ON HOLD, CAME BACK, TOLD ME TO TAKE THE CAR TO A LOCAL TIRE COMPANY AND LET THEIR REPRESENTATIVE LOOK AT THE TIRES.   THE TIRES WERE LOOKED AT, THE REP CALL GOODYEAR, CAME BACK AND TOLD ME GOODYEAR WOULD BE REPLACING THE FRONT TIRES. GOODYEAR WOULD ALSO SEND ME A REBATE FOR THE BACK TIRES, NOTHING ELSE.  I WONDER IF THIS IS PART OF THE SAME PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING WITH BMW 5 SERIES AND GOODYEAR RUNFLATS.  LASTLY, I STILL HAVE THE TIRE WITH THE CORDS SHOWING AND THE TREAD SEPARATING.  THE DEALERSHIP GAVE THEM BACK TO ME SINCE I PAID FULL PRICE FOR THE TIRES AT THE TIME OF REPLACEMENT.  *TR",

I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED FOR AROUND $500 AND THE MECHANIC MADE NO MENTION TO ME ABOUT THE BUBBLED SIDEWALL ISSUE WITH THIS TIRE ALTHOUGH, AS IT TURNS OUT, HE WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.    AT THE TIME OF REPAIR OF THE ABOVE FLAT, MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT TIRE ALSO HAD A BUBBLED SIDEWALL NECESSITATING REPLACEMENT OF THAT TIRE IN ORDER TO PASS MY STATE VEHICLE INSPECTION.    SINCE THE REPAIR IN LATE MARCH 2012, I NOTICED THAT THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT TIRE HAS A BUBBLED SIDEWALL. I MIGHT ADD THAT NO POTHOLES HAVE BEEN HIT, DO ROAD DEBRIS HAS BEEN STRUCK.

THE RUN FLATS DO NOT BURST, BUT BUBBLE APPEAR ON THE SIDE AND EVENTUALLY THEY DEFLATE. AFTER THAT HAPPENS THEY ARE INOPERABLE UNLESS YOU DRIVE BELOW 30 MILES AN HOUR. HENCE I HAVE REPLACED FOUR TIRES SO FAR AT A COST OF NEARLY $2000. (RECEIPTS AVAILABLE). I HAVE SPOKEN TO BMW NORTH AMERICA,WHO INSTALLS THESE TIRES, AFTER MUCH HAGGLING THEY FINALLY AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR HALF MY COST. HOWEVER I AM REALLY NERVOUS DRIVING THE CAR NOW, AS THE SLIGHTEST IMPERFECTION ON ROAD SURFACE CREATES A MAJOR TIRE PROBLEM.THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS TO BMW (SEE WEBSITE 'BIMMERFEST' (A BMW ENTHUSIAST WEBSITE). THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT ARE TRYING  TO DEAL WITH ON A ONE BY ONE BASIS. BECAUSE THE CAR COMES WITH RUN FLAT TIRES ONLY, THERE IS NO SPARE TIRE. HENCE IF YOU REPLACE WITH REGULAR TIRE, YOU HAVE NO BACKUP IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE. I AM HOPING THAT YOU WOULD INVESTIGATE AND HOPEFULLY PERSUADE BMW TO RECALL THESE TIRES AND REPLACE WITH BETTER TIRES. WHEN I SPEAK WITH BMW OF NORTH AMERICA THEY RESPOND AND SAY THAT THESE ARE GOODYEAR TIRES, AND NOT MANUFACTURED BY BMW HENCE THEY TRY AND TRANSFER THE BLAME TO GOODYEAR. BMW SOLD THIS VEHICLE WITH THESE TIRES, THEY CHOSE THEM. I SUSPECT TO SAFE MONEY ON PUTTING A SPARE OR DONUT WHEEL IN THE CAR. IN MY MIND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE.

I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AND STEERING LOCKED UP. THE CAR WAS PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEN TOWED TO THE BMW DEALERSHIP. INITIAL ANALYSIS FROM THE BMW DEALERSHIP WAS THAT THE ERROR RECORDED (FAULT STORED FOR VALVETRONIC SYSTEM. DEVIATION TOO GREAT. FREQUENCY 1 LOGISTICS 38.) DID NOT POINT TO A SPECIFIC COMPONENT FAILURE. THE ERROR DID INDICATE THAT A CERTAIN SOFTWARE LEVEL SHOULD BE LOADED IN THE CAR, BUT THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID I ALREADY HAD THE CORRECT SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED.  THEY RELOADED THE SOFTWARE LEVEL ANYWAY. THE BMW  DEALERSHIP KEPT THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS OF TESTING AND DRIVING, BUT COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. AFTER 3 DAYS, THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY NOTICED THAT I ACTUALLY DID NOT ORIGINALLY HAVE THE LATEST SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL INSTALLED IN MY CAR. SO, THE ONLY FIX PROVIDED BY BMW FOR MY ENGINE MALFUNCTION AND SHUTDOWN WAS LOADING A NEW SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL (PROGRAM I LEVEL NEW F010-10-06-512), THE PREVIOUS SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED IN MY CAR AT THE PLANT WAS PROGRAM I LEVEL PLANT F010-10-06-511. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, WHILE THE CAR WAS AT THE BMW DEALERSHIP, THEY DID INSTALL THE FIX FOR THE FUEL TANK SENSOR RECALL (BULLETIN 121410).

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION, WITH \"FUEL PUMP MALFUNCTION\", AND \"ENGINE MALFUNCTION\" ON THE ONBOARD DASH.  I HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THIS OCCURRED.  I WAS ALSO CARRYING A 5 GALLON SQUARE CONTAINER OF WATER THAT WAS CAPPED AND SEALED IN THE TRUNK.  DURING THE ABRUPT STOP OF THE CAR, ABOUT 1/2 A GALLON OF WATER SPILLED INTO THE TRUNK.  AFTER BEING TOWED TO SHELLY BMW AND TALKING TO THEM THE NEXT DAY, THEY SAID IT WAS MY FAULT AND THAT THE WATER SHORTED OUT THE COMPONENTS IN THE TRUNK.  #1.  THE WATER SPILLED INTO THE TRUNK AFTER THE CAR ABRUPTLY STOPPED.  #2.  I WAS ALMOST REAR-ENDED BY THE CARS BEHIND ME WHEN THE CAR WENT FROM 30MPH TO 0MPH.  THE CAR DID NOT STALL AND SLOWLY COME TO A STOP....IT BASICALLY LOCKED UP AND STOPPED....CAUSING ME TO HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL.  SHELLY BMW IS NOW TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO PAY $2600 TO REPAIR/REPLACE THE MODULES THAT ARE DAMAGED.  #3.  THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON JULY 26, 2010.  #4.  IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS NOT HIT FROM OTHER CARS AS I SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION FOR 1.5 HOURS WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK.  I AM CONSIDERING SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE.  THIS ISSUE IS ALSO FILED WITH BMW NORTH AMERICA IN WHICH I AM STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO CONTACT ME. *TR",
