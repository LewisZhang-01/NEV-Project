I LEFT AND WAS GOING ABOUT 10MPH AND LIGHTLY PUT MY BRAKES ON AND MY FRONT BRAKES LOCKED UP, I CAME TO A SCREECHING HALT.  I IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK TO AUDI AND THEY SAID THAT MY ABS MODULE IS NOT WORKING.  IMAGINE IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY BRAKES LOCKED UP.  THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED.  SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY PRODUCT CAN YOU REPLACE THE PART.  IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I GO TO AUDI JUST FOR AN OIL CHANGE THAT I NEVER LEAVE WITHOUT SPENDING MORE MONEY, BECAUSE THEY FIND THINGS THAT ARE WRONG.  I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER AUDI OWNERS AND THEY SAY THAT THEY PROBABLY SABOTAGE OUR CARS JUST SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY.  AS I JUST WENT IN FOR A OIL CHANGE AND THEY SAID THAT MY SECONDARY WATER PUMP WAS NOT WORKING.  THERE WAS NO CEL (CHECK ENGINE LIGHT) I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD COME ON IF THAT FAILED.  I HOPE THAT THIS ABS CONTROL MODULE DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE ON THE HIGHWAY DUE TO THIS NON WORKING SAFETY PART. THE PART NUMBER IS:  8EO 614 111E OR 8EO 614 111A  SINCE I COULD NOT FIND AUDI UNDER MANUFACTURER BUT I HAVE A 2000 AUDI S4.    THANK YOU AND HAVE A GREAT DAY. *TR",

THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I HAD THE CAR INSPECTED BY TWO INDEPENDENT SERVICE AND REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS, BOTH OF WHICH CONFIRMED AN INTERMITTENT ELECTRONIC FAILURE IN THE VEHICLE'S ABS CONTROL MODULE (A $1000+ PART).

YET, BASED ON QUANTITY (NOT PERCENTAGE) OF STOLEN CARS, THE S4 IS #25.  IF THE LIST PORTRAYED # OF STOLEN VEHICLES AS A PERCENTAGE OF # OF VEHICLES PRODUCED, THEN SURELY THE S4 WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THIS LIST AND PROBABLY ATOP THE LIST OF SEVERAL OTHER STATES AS WELL!

FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD TURBO FAILURES, SOME HAVE INDICATED AN ABNORMAL 'SIREN' SOUND WHEN ACCELERATING.  THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TURBOS THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN REPLACED (WITHOUT FAILURE) BECAUSE OF COMPLAINS OF THIS SOUND.  MY CAR STARTED EXHIBITING THIS SOUND FROM 2K MILES ONWARD.  INITIALLY, THIS SOUND OCCURED ONLY WHEN THE ENGINE WAS COLD.  IT IS HOWEVER NOW MORE APPARENT MOST OF THE TIME.  I HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AUDI SERVICE DEPARTMENT BUT HAVE INSISTED THAT SOUND IS NORMAL AND IS APPARENT EVEN ON NEW CARS.  SINCE THEN I HAVE TEST DRIVEN A NEW S4 AND THE SOUND IS NOT PRESENT.  THE THEORY TO THE CURRENT FAILURE IS THAT THERE IS AN INSUFFICIENT OIL SUPPLY TO THE TURBOS AND BECAUSE OF THIS THE INTERNAL BEARINGS ARE DAMAGED AND HENCE START WHINING ('SIREN SOUND')AND EVENTUALLY FAILING.  A FEW CHANGES BY AUDI ALSO SUPPORTS THIS THEORY.  1)  THEY HAVE  REVISED THE TURBOS ON THE NEWER S4S.  THE OIL INLET TO THE NEW TURBOS ARE NOW LARGER.  ALSO,2) THEY HAVE REVISED THE RECOMMENDED OIL WEIGHT FROM A 5-40W TO 0-30W WHICH ENSURES BETTER OIL FLOW AND LUBRICATION AT LOWER TEMPERATURES.  THE REASON OF MY CONCERN IS THAT THE TURBOS COST MORE THAN $5000 DOLLARS TO REPLACE AND I INTEND TO KEEP MY CAR FOR 5 YEARS OR 90K MILES (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST).  FYI THE 'SIREN' SOUND IS SOMETIMES LOUD ENOUGH THAT PASSENGERS IN MY CAR THINK THAT THERE IS A EMERGENCY VEHICLE IN THE VICINITY.

THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO OCCUR APPROXIMATELY EVERY 1900 MILES. I CONTACTED BRIDGESTONE AND THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT SINCE THESE TIRES HAVE A LOW PROFILE SIDEWALL, THEY ARE PRONE TO DAMAGE FROM DRIVING ON \"ROUGH\" ROADS. I TOLD HIM THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE THE ROADS MAY BE \"ROUGH\"  BUT THAT LOW PROFILE TIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENGINEERED WITH A STRONGER SIDEWALL TO ABSORB ANY \"ROUGHNESS\" IN THE ROAD. THIS IS WHY THEY COST SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN TIRES WITH A LARGER SIDEWALL. AS AN ENGINEER, I KNOW THAT THE SIDEWALL SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ON A LOW PROFILE TIRE TO PREVENT DAMAGE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF A FAILURE OR AN ACCIDENT. I BELIEVE THAT THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE UNLESS THEY ARE USED ONLY ON PERFECTLY SMOOTH ROADS. I STILL HAD TO PAY $125, HALF PRICE FOR A NEW TIRE, AND I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWERS I RECEIVED AT ALL. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THESE TIRES AS WELL AS CONCERENED FOR MY SAFETY WHILE DRIVING WITH THESE TIRES. IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT NORMAL EVERYDAY DRIVING WOULD CAUSE TWO IDENTICAL TIRE FAILURES IN LESS THAN 4000 MILES ON A BRAND NEW CAR. THE MANUFACTURER INSISTS THAT  THERE IS NO DEFECT AND THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES. HOW CAN THIS BE? MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON THE SAME ROADS FOR YEARS WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT CARS EQUIPPED WITH VARIOUS TYPES OF TIRES AND HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED TIRE PROBLEMS BEFORE. ONE MORE POINT OF INTEREST IS THAT ON THE BRIDGESTONE WEBSITE, THE POTENZA RE-040 TIRES ARE NOT EVEN LISTED IN THE CATALOG. THIS SEEMS STRANGE TO ME. PERHAPS THERE IS A PROBLEM OR A RECALL AND THE MANUFACTURER JUST DOES NOT WANT TO STAY.
