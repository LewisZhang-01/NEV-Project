Truck then started blinking lights and telling me to restart. upon restart, the truck would not engage the transmission. Truck was in drive but the motor was just rev'ing. I turned truck off and then back on and it seemed to return to normal. Am not comfortable driving truck at this time. GM has been notified of the issue, and, has not diagnosed an issue, as of this writing.",
