I ACTUALLY SPOKE HIGHLY ABOUT MITSUBISHI'S IN THE PAST, BUT NOW I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.  TOO BAD MITSUBISHI COMPANY HAS SUCH A BAD HISTORY OF FAILURES, RECALLS, AND POOR REPAIR SERVICE.  I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF BUYING A 2006 ECLIPSE........NOT ANY MORE.  I'LL MISS MY 97 ECLIPSE......IT WAS PRETTY GOOD TO ME, BUT THIS RECENT EVENT WITH NO WARNING, DID ME IN AND IT IS JUST WRONG THAT I HAVE READ SIMILAR INCIDENTS ON THE INTERNET AND MITSUBISHI DOES NOTHING.  TIME FOR AN AMERICAN CAR...............TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE THE SENSE TO MAKE OIL AND GAS-FREE VEHICLES THOUGH.......THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE.  OH WELL......I GUESS I BETTER START FIGURING OUT HOW I AM GOING TO GET TO WORK ON MONDAY.  *JB",
