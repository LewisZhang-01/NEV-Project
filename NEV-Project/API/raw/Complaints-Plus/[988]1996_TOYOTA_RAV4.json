DEAR TOYOTA (EDITED FOR SPACE),  IT IS RARE THAT I WOULD TAKE THIS STEP UNLESS I THOUGHT NOT SPEAKING UP COULD BE FAR MORE TRAGIC OR DISASTROUS.  LAST WEEK, AS I WAS SLOWLY TURNING THE CORNER DOWN A SIDE STREET AT WORK (I WORK ON AN ARMY INSTALLATION), I HEARD AND FELT A TREMENDOUS CRASH. MY RAV-4 DROPPED ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND THE TIRE INSTANTLY BLEW. MY MOMENTUM WAS STOPPED BY A LARGE CONCRETE BARRIER OR I MAY HAVE HIT SOMEONE.  AFTER I WAS TOWED (THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE), THE MECHANIC CONFIRMED WHAT I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF THE ENGINEERS - SOMETHING SNAPPED (COMPLETELY SEVERED) UNDERNEATH (\"IN A WEIRD SPOT\")....THAT SOMETHING WAS PART OF THE STEERING KNUCKLE.  AS I TRAVEL ROUTE 80 IN NORTHERN NJ, I AM VERY GRATEFUL WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT IF I HAD BEEN ON A HIGHWAY, I WOULD HAVE FLIPPED, POSSIBLY SEVERAL TIMES, AND, OBVIOUSLY, WOULD NOT BE WRITING TO YOU NOW.....I BOUGHT MY RAV-4 IN 1996 WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT. ALTHOUGH IT COST ME $1800.00 IN REPAIRS, THE MONEY IS LEAST IMPORTANT IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS. I'M CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT THE ROAD SURFACE TO AVOID ANY BUMP....BRAKING INAPPROPRIATELY, BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.  I WOULD NOT BE THIS UPSET IF THIS WAS A SMALL CAR, BUT THIS IS A SUV AND I EXPECT IT TO HANDLE THE RIGORS OF A NJ WINTER. EVEN A TOYOTA MECHANIC TOLD ME THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED...TO PARAPHRASE HIM....'THESE TRUCKS ARE BUILT TO LAST FOREVER'.  COULD THERE BE A FLAW IN THE PART?   I TOOK A DIGITAL PHOTO OF THE PART THAT WAS COMPLETELY SEVERED (AND NO, IT IS NOT THE BALL JOINT). I CANNOT ATTACH IT TO THIS E-MAIL. TELLING ME A BOUGHT THE CAR IN '96 AND HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES ON IT IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER.  THANK YOU,    CELESTE GOODHART.  *AK",

I REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM TOYOTA AND MET WITH THE CUSTOMER SVC MANAGER, KAREN SEARS SEVERAL TIMES AND PRIOR TO THE REPAIR IN DEC. 98 I DID CONTACT TOYOTA AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO AND I WOULD NEED TO REQUEST ARBITRATION. I REQUESTED ARBITRATION AND THEY DID NOTHING BECAUSE I TOOK IT TO A NON TOYOTA FACILITY FOR REPAIR. I HAD TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE BRAKES AND REFERRED ME TO ARBITRATION AND I OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH GRINDING BRAKES.  THE ONLY WORK DONE WAS THEY REPLACED THE PADS AND ALSO TOLD ME THE ROTORS AND CYLINDERS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN DEC. 1997, BUT I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT BRAKES SHOULD NOT BE WEARING OUT THIS SOON ON A NEW VEHICLE.  I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS BRAKE SYSTEM SINCE I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE BEGINNING WITHT HE BRAKE DUST ACCUMULATION.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO-I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND I HAVE ASKED THEM TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE, I HAVE REQUESTED ARBITRATION AND I HAVE APPEALED THE ARBITRATION DECISION.  I AM HOPEFUL YOU CAN HELP ME BECAUSE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKE SYSTEM ON THIS VEHICLE.  ALSO WHEN I HAD MY BRAKES CHANGED OVER THE WEEKEND I MET A MAN WHO ALSO HAD A 2 DOOR RAV4 , WHO ALSO TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, HAVING TO CHANGE BRAKES PADS AND SHOES OFTEN.  I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IS HAVING A PROBLEM BUT I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE BRAKE PADS EVERY 6-9 MONTHS AS I AM A SINGLE PARENT AND I CANNOT AFFORD THE $600-$1000 WORTH OF BRAKE WORK THE VEHICLE NEEDS.
