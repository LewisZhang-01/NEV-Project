THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED ON 2 OCCASIONS ,JULY 16TH 2016 AND JULY 22ND 2016.DEALERSHIP AT FIRST COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE FIRST CADILLAC DEALERSHIP IN BETHESDA MARYLAND. THE 2ND DEALERSHIP TOOK A WEEK TO CREATE, IDENTIFY, AND HOPEFULLY REPAIR THE PROBLEM. REPLACING FUEL PUMP ENDED UP BEING THE CALL. 1005.00 DOLLARS LATER I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM. THIS INDEED IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AS IT DOES NOT SHOW ANY WARNINGS IT JUST STALLED OUT.",

OPENED THE HOOD AND 3FT FLAMES SHOT OUT, THE ALARM WENT OFF AS SMOKE AND FLAMES FILLED THE AIR. A LADY IN A HOME NEARBY RAN OUT WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO ASSIST. FIRE AND POLICE CAME, REPORT WAS FILED. MY LUNGS BURNED FOR WEEKS AFTER AND I HAD A CHRONIC COUGH. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER FOUND IT TO BE A MANUFACTURE DEFECT BUT GM REFUSED TO WORK WITH US ON COSTS. WE HAD TO PAY FULL PRICE OUT OF POCKET FOR REPAIRS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH BBB, GM, AND MANY OTHERS BUT GOT NO ASSISTANCE. I ALSO HAD ISSUES WITH THIS SUV AND THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 100,000 MILES WHICH THE SHOP SAID IT WAS UNUSUAL BUT FOR A TRANSMISSION TO FAIL AT THIS LOW OF MILES BUT IN THESE TRANSMISSIONS IT IS A  KNOWN PROBLEM. IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT IF FAILING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN DOING 65 AND LOCKED UP. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN ISSUES WITH THE FUEL LEVEL SENSOR WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO REPORTED, DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELD WHICH GM REFUSED TO REPLACE. THE FILM OVER THE WINDSHIELD WAS DEFECTIVE WHICH CAUSED BLURRY VISION IN THE DRIVERS LINE OF VIEW. I HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. GM HAS NOT BACKED ANY OF THE ISSUES WITH THIS SUV. IT HAS BEEN A LEMON SINCE DAY ONE. I HAVE ALL RECEIPTS FOR REPAIRS.  *TR",

AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MULTIPLE MECHANICS. IF YOUR WINDSHIELD IS DEFECTIVE DUE TO THE PLASTIC AND GLASS SEPARATING AND YOU CAN'T SEE TO DRIVE, THAT TOO IS A SAFETY ISSUE.
