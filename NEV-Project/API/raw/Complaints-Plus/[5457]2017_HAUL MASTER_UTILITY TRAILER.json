IN APRIL 2018 TRIED TO GET INFORMATION ON THE TRAILER FROM HF WEBSITE, BUT ALL THE TRAILERS WERE NO LONGER LISTED. AFTER A WEB SEARCH I FOUND THE RECALL INFORMATION. I WENT TO THE SIERRA VISTA, AZ STORE TO GET REPLACEMENT TIRES, TOLD THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY YET (RECALL INFORMATION SAID THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN DECEMBER 2017). IN JUNE 2018 I WENT TO THE SIERRA VISTA STORE AGAIN AND THEY SAID THEY HAD THEM. I HAPPENED TO HAVE THE TRAILER WITH ME THAT DAY, SO IN THE PARKING LOT I JACKED UP THE TRAILER AND TOOK THE TIRES INSIDE. THEY THEN SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF THE 5 LUG, ONLY THE 4 LUG, SO I HAD TO PUT THE TIRES BACK ON WITH NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN THEY WOULD BE IN. AS OF AUGUST 2018, I STILL HAVE YET TO BE NOTIFIED (ALTHOUGH HF HAS MY ADDRESS, EMAIL, AND PHONE FROM THE ONLINE ORDER MEANING IT IS IN THEIR DATABASE) AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE REPLACEMENT TIRES.",
