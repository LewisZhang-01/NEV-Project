THE PASSENGER SIDE POWER SLIDING DOOR AND THE DRIVERS SIDE POWER SLIDING DOOR HAS GIVEN US PROBLEMS SINCE WE PURCHASED THE CAR. WE HAD IT BACK TO THE DEALER FOR THE SAME POWER DOOR ISSUE AT LEAST 11 TIMES. THEY NOW WANT TO CHARGE ME. THE NTSB SHOULD FORCE A RECALL TO FIX THIS ISSUE. THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN OR CLOSE AND NOW IT WILL NOT MOVE AT ALL EITHER BY REMOTE OR MANUALLY. WE PURCHASED THE DUAL POWER SLIDERS AS A CONVENIENCE AND NOW WE HAVE INCONVENIENCE. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE THE DOOR PROPERLY FOR YEARS, WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE BENEFIT OF THE POWER SLIDING DOORS THAT WE PAID FOR. I WOULD REQUEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATE THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THE VARIOUS BLOGS FOR THE SAME ISSUE DESCRIBED HERE. WE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER TEN YEARS WITHOUT A RESOLUTION PROVIDED BY TOYOTA. THE DOORS STILL DO NOT FUNCTION. TOYOTA DOES NOT CARE.  *KB",

ONCE THROUGH REGISTRATION, WE RE-ENTERED THE 2001 TOYOTA SIENNA MINIVAN. UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID NOT USE THE SEAT BELTS, SINCE WE COULD SEE THE SPOT WE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED. SOMETIME DURING THIS MOVE, I MUST HAVE HAD A SEIZURE, SINCE THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS SOMEONE HELPING ME OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR. ONCE AT THE HOSPITAL, I LAPSED INTO A COMA, WHICH WAS TO LAST FOR THE NEXT 18 DAYS. ONCE I WOKE UP, I WAS TOLD THAT MY SON HAD DIED, AND WAS BURIED. IT WAS STATED TO ME THAT WE WEREN'T WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS. I SAID, \"WHAT ABOUT THE AIRBAGS?\" THEY HADN'T DEPLOYED, IT TURNED OUT. I REALIZE THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SAFE IF WE HAD BEEN WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED, SINCE THE ESTIMATED SPEED AT TIME OF IMPACT WAS 50 MPH. SINCE WE HAD GONE THROUGH A CREEK, AND SLAMMED INTO THE OPPOSITE CREEK BANK IN A BASIC HEAD ON COLLISION. I ALSO KNOW THAT THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT IF THE AIRBAGS HAD DEPLOYED, SINCE BOTH MY SON AND I SUSTAINED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES (TBI'S) . ONCE I WAS ABLE TO USE A COMPUTER, I RESEARCHED AIRBAG FAILURES IN TOYOTA VEHICLES, AND FOUND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS AND ANECDOTES OF OTHER PEOPLES'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM - FAILURE OF THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY, WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE NEEDED. I ALSO WONDERED ABOUT THE COMMONALITY OF THE PROBLEM, AND BEGAN TO SUSPECT A COMPANY-WIDE POLICY TO MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY, SINCE IT WAS A HOT TOPIC THEN TO TALK ABOUT AIRBAGS AS AN ENEMY, SINCE SOME REPORTS WERE NOTING ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE AIRBAGS' MIS-DEPLOYMENT. I AM NOT AT PEACE WITH THE TOYOTA COMPANY'S USUAL DENIAL OF ANYTHING NOT WORKING PERFECTLY AND PROPERLY AND THAT THERE WAS A SAFETY ISSUE INVOLVING THEIR AIRBAGS.",

THE FIRST TIME WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT (TOYOTA OF SANTA MARIA, CALIFORNIA) ABOUT THIS ISSUE WAS FEBRUARY 2008 (ODOMETER 101,112). THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD US THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT SERVICED THE THROTTLE BODY AND LUBRICATED THE EXPOSED THROTTLE CABLES. THE GAS PEDAL RESPONDED BETTER.     IN NOVEMBER 2009 WE STARTED EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM AGAIN AND ON DECEMBER 10, 2009 WE TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT (ODOMETER 111,596). WE REQUESTED A SIMILAR SERVICE TO SEE IF IT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM BUT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CLAIMED TO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS VISIT TO 'FIX' THE STICKY GAS PEDAL. THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND WE TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME. WITHIN THE SAME DAY THE ACCELERATOR WAS STICKING. WE FELT UNSAFE DRIVING OUR TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE AND PARKED IT IN THE GARAGE FOR A MONTH UNTIL WE COULD TAKE IT BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.    ON JANUARY 11, 2010 WE BROUGHT IT BACK AND INSISTED THEY FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE WERE ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL WITH OUR VEHICLE, PERHAPS JUST SOME CARBON BUILD UP ON THE THROTTLE BODY PLATE. WE DIDN'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE HOME AND LEFT IT AT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHERE IT HAS REMAINED TO THIS DAY. ON JANUARY 21, 2010, TOYOTA ANNOUNCED A RECALL DUE TO A STICKING GAS PEDAL THAT, IN PART, DESCRIBES OUR ISSUE. OUR 2001 SIENNA IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL. *TR",

ISSUED ME A CASE NO.:2005-0818-0778 (FILED 8/18/05).I ALSO ASKED SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, AUTO MECHANICS, AND TOYOTA CORP. AGENT THAT HAVE THEY SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING SIMILAR LIKE MY CASE, NOBODY COULD CONFIRM IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM OF \"WEAR & TEAR\" BEYOND WARRANTY PERIOD.  THE QUESTION IS HOW A CONSUMER LIKE MYSELF GET PROJECTED FROM THE \"DEFECTIVE PART\"  THAT A DRIVER DEFENDS HEAVILY FOR MANEUVERING OF THE VEHICLE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE GEARS? FORTUNATELY, THE INCIDENT DIDN'T HAPPEN WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY WITH MY WIFE AND (3) YOUNG KIDS OR GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAILROAD WITH RUNNING TRAIN APPROACHING.  I BELIEVE THAT \"SAFETY ISSUE\" SHALL BE THE FIRST PRIORITY NEEDED TO BE RESOLVED BY TOYOTA CORP.",

WE TOLD TOYOTA ORIGINALLY THAT IT HAD TO BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, YOU DON'T DRIVE AROUND AND EXPECT THE WINDOWS TO BLOW OUT OF YOUR CAR.  THEY SAID BECAUSE WE WERE OVER OUR 50000 MILES THEY WOULDN'T BE RESPONSIBLE.  NOW  IN ADDITION TO THEM NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR  A DEFECTIVE MOONROOF, THEY ALSO GAVE US BAD ADVISE ON FIXING IT.  THEY TOLD US ONLY ONE VERY EXPENSIVE OPTION AND THEN ONE VERY CHEAP.  NOTHING IN BETWEEN WAS OFFERED AND AFTER TALKING TO OUR INSURANCE ADJUSTER, THERE WAS MANY OTHER WAYS TO FIX THE VEHICLE (ONLY REPLACE THE GLASS, GET ONE FROM A JUNK YARD ETC) BUT THEY DIDN'T OFFER THOSE LESS EXPENSIVE REPAIRS SO OF COURSE WE TRIED THE GLUE.  AFTER METLIFE SENT AN ENGINEER FROM AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY DID WE FIND OUT THEY USED AN APPOXY THAT ISN'T MEANT FOR FIXING SUNROOF'S OR CARS. *JB",

SINCE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, SEVERAL THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG.  #1- PASSENGER SIDE POWER WINDOW HAD A DEFECTIVE MOTOR AND WOULD NOT GO BACK UP.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO SAID IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, SO WE HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THAT REPAIR.  #2- DRIVER'S SIDE SLIDING DOOR WOULD NOT LATCH SHUT.  THE BUTTON GOT STUCK FROM THE INSIDE WHICH PREVENTED THE DOOR FROM LATCHING SHUT.  THIS HAD HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE BUTTON POPPED OUT AND THE DOOR WOULD SHUT.  BUT ON ONE OCCASION THE BUTTON POPPED OUT AND THE DOOR STILL WOULD NOT SHUT.  WE HAD TO DRIVE HOME HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT THE ENTIRE WAY!  OF COURSE, THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE WITH OUR 2 YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE CAR.  THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED AT THE DEALER (AGAIN NOT UNDER WARRANTY), BUT THE DOOR STILL CAN NOT BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE, OR THE BUTTON GETS STUCK IN.  #3- CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND A DIAGNOSTIC TEST REVEALED THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS- IDLE AIR CONTROL, BANK 1 SENSOR (MOST LIKELY OXYGEN SENSOR), LEAKY CHARCOAL CANISTER.  WE FIXED THE IDLE AIR CONTROL SINCE THAT WAS CAUSING THE VAN TO NOT START AND STALL.  THIS REPAIR WAS ALMOST $700, AND NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE WE HAD GONE OVER 36,000 MILES.  WE DID NOT FIX THE OTHER TWO PROBLEMS LAST MONTH DUE TO COST.  THE VAN OVERHEATS AND CAN NOT BE DRIVEN.  WE WROTE A LETTER TO TOYOTA AND TALKED TO THEM VIA PHONE.  THEY TOLD US THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO BECAUSE OUR VAN IS NOT A LEGAL US VAN- IT IS WAS BUILT IN CANADA.  WE BOUGHT IT AT A TOYOTA DEALER IN ROCHESTER, NY AND WERE NEVER TOLD IT WAS CANADIAN.  WE WERE ALSO TOLD THAT NO WARRANTY WOULD EVER BE COVERED IN THE US BECAUSE IT IS CANADIAN.  CARFAX.COM SAYS IT WAS BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER.
