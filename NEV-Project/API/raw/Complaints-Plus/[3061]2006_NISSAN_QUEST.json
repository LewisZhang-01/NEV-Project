THE INCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED SIX TIMES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE MOST RECENT BEING ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, WHILE TRYING TO BRAKE AS I APPROACHED A DANGEROUS CURVE ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD.    PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ACCELERATOR WAS NOT OBSTRUCTED BY THE FLOOR MAT OR ANY OTHER OBJECT DURING THESE INCIDENTS, NOR WAS THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL DEPRESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BRAKE PEDAL.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO EISENHAUER NISSAN ON AT THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENT ON NOVEMBER 17, 2009. I ALSO CALLED NISSAN CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE ISSUE. THE DEALERSHIP WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM OR CORRECT IT BECAUSE THE INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WAS NOT OCCURRING AT THAT MOMENT. ON NOVEMBER 17 NISSAN REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OWEN WELCH RESPONDED TO MY SECOND CALL TO NISSAN HQ, BUT TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING NISSAN COULD DO FOR ME. AT MY INSISTENCE HE SAID HE WOULD FOLLOW UP. WELCH CALLED AGAIN ON NOVEMBER 23, 2009 TO INFORM ME THAT NISSAN COULDN'T HELP AND THAT HE WAS CLOSING MY FILE. THE VEHICLE HAS APPROXIMATELY 52,000 MILES AND IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. *TR",
