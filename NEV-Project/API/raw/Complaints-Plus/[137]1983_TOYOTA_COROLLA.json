THE TIRES DID NOT HYDROPLANE AND THE ROAD SURFACE ONLY NEEDED TO BE WET FOR THIS UNPREDICTABLE CONDITION.  AIR PRESSURE DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECT ON WET TRACTION.  TIRE WEAR AND DRY TRACTION WERE NORMAL.  THESE FIRESTONE TIRES WERE REPLACED WHILE THEY STILL HAD GOOD TREAD WITH MICHELIN TIRES AND THE WET TRACTION PROBLEM WAS COMPLETELY CORRECTED.  THE TIRE DEALER, COMMERCIAL TIRE IN ELKRIDGE, MD, WAS CONTACTED WHEN THE TIRES WERE NEW WITH THIS PROBLEM AND DID NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE OR OFFER ANY CORRECTION, THEY ONLY INDICATED THAT THESE WERE THE BETTER OF THE TWO TIRES THEY HAD FOR THIS VEHICLE APPLICATION.*AK (DOT NUMBER: HYE9 437  TIRESIZE: 165R13 82T)",
