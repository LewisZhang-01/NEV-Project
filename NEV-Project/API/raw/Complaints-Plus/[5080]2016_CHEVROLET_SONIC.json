The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who diagnosed that the thermostat housing had melted and needed to be replaced. The contact stated that the vehicle was repaired; however, the failure reoccurred while driving. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic several times and the thermostat housing was replaced three times due to its plastic-based material. The contact stated that she was unable to drive the vehicle for more than an hour and a half without a reoccurrence of the failure. The vehicle was taken back to the independent mechanic who diagnosed that the head gasket had melted. The independent mechanic advised the contact to purchase a new vehicle like the engine compartment of the vehicle was poorly made. The dealer was not notified of the failure. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and offered to assist the contact with scheduling an appointment with the dealer for diagnosis. The vehicle was not repaired.

IN MARCH, 2020 I NOTICED THAT WHEN I WOULD TURN THE CAR ON THE RADIO/COMPUTER WOULD SOMETIMES TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES TO BOOT UP. THEN ONCE BOOTED, THE BACK-UP CAMERA LINES WOULD NOT SHOW UP.
