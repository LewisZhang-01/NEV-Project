GM HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS OBVIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY DESIGN FLAW.  THEY HAVE STOOD BY THEIR CLAIMS OF 'USER ERROR' IN EACH AND EVERY CASE, REGARDLESS OF THE DRIVER'S EXPERIENCE AND SKILL WITH CLUTCH DRIVING.   SOME OF THOSE ACCOUNTS CLAIM THAT THEIR SERVICE MANAGERS  ADMITTED TO THEM THAT THERE IS A FLAW IN THE CAR BUT THEY TOLD THE CUSTOMER THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE GM WILL NOT OWN UP TO THEIR DESIGN MISTAKE.  *TR",
