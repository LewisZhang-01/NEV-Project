On or around 2/11 we dropped our vehicle off for our annual state inspection, on 2/12, While driving the vehicle, the \"Malfunction\" light came on along with front/rear collision warnings. Car nearly stopped in the middle of the road. We returned the vehicle to the mechanic, who stated that the computer gave an error code that the battery needed to be changed ($+193). Seemed odd for a three year old car, but we wanted to be safe and changed the battery. On 2/14 we changed the battery. On 2/15 we had a repeat of the earlier occurrence. This timed it happened on a highway! Mechanic suggested taking it to dealership On 2/16 we took car to dealership. They diagnosed the issue as the EZ pass obstructing the camera, and they realigned the laser guidance system ($150). On Feb 15 the car broke down again, 30 miles from home. Same issue. we needed to tow the car to the dealership($300). They held it for a couple of days, and diagnosed the issue as a faulty Crank Sensor ($329). This solved the problem until 3/25, and now the issue is occurring again.   PLEASE HELP! THE CAR IS NOT SAFE AND I DONT WANT ANYONE TO GET HURT!   There are complaints about this issue all over the internet, including reports on the news.",

The vehicle was in the process of making a left hand turn when the incident occurred only traveling about 15 mph. As the brakes engaged, the steering wheel locked momentarily before power steering returned, additionally the engine completely died in the middle of the road. Luckily, the forward momentum was just enough for the vehicle to be steered into a side road. Once stopped numerous signals flashed in the dash including \u201cAEB malfunction\u201d and to see the dealer. Vehicle was totally dead and refused to start. A kind stranger assisted in pushing the vehicle to the side of the road. The insurance company sent a tow which allowed for the vehicle to be parked in the driveway. Nissan was informed of the issue and sent a courtesy tow to their local dealer. I was told the vehicle had an issue with the ECU. A special order was placed which took 6 days to arrive. Once installed, it was determined that the ECU was not the issue. As of this writing 7 days has elapsed and no reasonable explanation has been provided for the gross negligence on behalf of Nissan for selling such an unsafe vehicle. Under different circumstances the same event may have resulted in damaged property or worse yet significant injury or death.",

The nearest car in front of me was approximately 100 feet ahead and there was no reason for it. My foot was lightly on the accelerator and not near my brake when I felt the car lurch and the familiar rumbling of the ABS system. As I reached my foot to where the brake pedal is, I felt that it was already depressed having done so automatically. I immediately tapped the accelerator to release the braking system.  The car behind me had gotten rather close and was honking their horn. I have tried to reproduce the problem in the past 24 hours but have been unable to do so as it happened on its own. There were no warnings or symptoms prior to the incident.  The vehicle is scheduled to be checked by the manufacturer tomorrow. If this had occurred at a high rate of speed, or in adverse weather conditions, it could have caused a multi-car collision resulting in damage to property, injury, or even death.",

My family's safety was at risk of course.

We (my husband and I) look to a place where they can replace it and I put a complaint in the BBB about Clay Cooley Nissan and of course they called me on Monday morning but I just waist my time, they told me they will help and I went all the way to them and nothing.

I was in blind spot collision accident on 10/4/2021 in VA on 395S at 3:30pm EST. I looked, looked again and did not see the vehicle in my blind spot and I genuinely feel that the BSW in this vehicle is not sufficient to alert a driver in those conditions in a manner that garners the drivers immediate attention.  Having been placed in  rental vehicle that has the BSW warning embedded in the sideview mirror itself I find that to be a much more immediate attention grabber than Nissan's BSW construct in my vehicle such that I have purchased aftermarket BSW mirrors to place on my sideview mirrors to prevent /assist with this issue.",

On  a side street College Ave next close to intersection, I experienced a false Automatic Emergency braking and luckily none was right behind me but if they had been I could've definitely been injured.  I took the car in for repair and they reported that they fixed the problem using the solution to a 2017?18 recall.  It happened a second time in April or May  of 2021 on the freeway and I wondered if it was because of the reflective paint on the 15 south San Diego freeway after the onramp at University Ave.  Again, luckily no one was following close behind or I could've been injured but I did not take it in again until a week or so later when it happened a third time in the same place.  The automatic emergency braking system broke hard and I was very shook up, luckily again I avoided an accident but it was a very dangerous situation.  When I took the vehicle in they said the sensor was not working and they assured me they fixed it wouldn't happen again.  Last Tuesday, September 14, 2021, close to the same location of the second and third incident, again, with no cars or objects in front of me the emergency braking system slammed on the brakes in this 4th incident. I was again lucky no one hit me but I did fear for my safety and felt I ran the risk of dying if I drive the car again.  We called Nissan and they said this would qualify for the Lemon Law.  I called and the case number #44716633.  I believe Nissan still hasn't figured out their braking problems in existence since 2017.",

I started the Rogue & called Fuccillio. Yes I can bring it by. When I proceeded to put in gear 'R', the brakes seemed to hold enough. Backed up and felt brakes were normal. At Fuccillio due to time of day and too many customers ahead of me, aske to return on Wed. 7/21/21 at 10:30am. Left the car, waited for Lyft but none called so called friend for pickup at 11:30am. On Thursday at 4:20pm Joseph(Rep) called, he just had the Rogue react 20-mins ago. What did it do? He replied it 'jerked' him in the seat. Friday I went to Fuccillio to pick up a Loaner via Lyft. At this time still no idea what caused the 'Brakes to go to the Floor'. I was informed my Rear brakes were wearing & while there consider new brakes. I did agree since Rogue now has been on roads 4yrs. I purchased the Rogue as a CPO which was a Rental on 2018 for one year according to Carfax with 33K-miles. Joseph(Rep) then said the $120 he quoted to fix brakes & out the door he will cancel and apply $129 for Brake Fluid Change. I told him Fluid was changed at 38K-miles. He insisted he is just moving the one cost over to the fluid ignoring that fluid already done. I could only assume he was wanting money for the 2-days they had my Rogue & could not get it to fail again.  I agreed to brake service & told Rogue would be ready on Saturday 7/24/21. Did not receive call all day so called. They ordered wrong brakes and he had new brakes ordered for Rogues with the Push-Button Emer-Brake Button. Again Rogue ready Mon. 7/26/21.

THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY WHEN AFTER THREE TRIPS TO THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS NORMAL AS THAT'S HOW NISSAN DESIGNED THE CLIMATE CONTROL DURING COLD OUTSIDE TEMPERATURES. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT NORMAL TO ME AND MY FAMILY.  CUSTOMER AFFAIR EVEN SCHEDULED A BIASED SUBJECT MATTER INSPECTOR TO MEET WITH ME TO ONLY TELL ME THAT IT'S NORMAL AND WORKING AS DESIGNED.

I CALLED DEALER AND SAID IF IT COMES ON, I WILL BRING IN BUT LET'S WAIT AND SEE.  ON WEDNESDAY (DAY 5 AND 440 MILES), I WAS COMMUTING HOME FROM WORK AND WHILE IN MIDDLE LANE OF SLOW MOVING TRAFFIC ON A STATE HIGHWAY, 6 MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHTS ALL WENT ON AND THE CAR FELT STRANGE.  AS SOON AS I COULD, I GOT INTO THE RIGHT LANE AND REALIZED I HAD NO ACCELERATION AS IF THE CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL.  I WAS ABLE TO COAST OVER AND INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT THANKFULLY.  I CALLED DEALER AND THEY ADVISED TO CALL FOR ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE AND TOW TO THEIR DEALERSHIP.  I WAS GIVEN A LOANER AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  THE CAR IS STILL NOT REPAIRED AFTER 8 DAYS OF BEING IN SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEM WORKING WITH NISSAN SPECIALISTS.  THEY BELIEVE THEY FOUND THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION ISSUE AND ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH IT AND WILL TEST BUT I DO NOT FEEL SAFE GETTING BACK INTO THIS VEHICLE AFTER HAVING AN ENGINE FAILURE THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY OR WORSE.",
