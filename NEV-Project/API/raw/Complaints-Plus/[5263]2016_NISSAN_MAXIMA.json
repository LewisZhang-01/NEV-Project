While turning left that\u2019s when I notice a decreased in power, and an exclamation symbo, but the car kept advancing very smooth!!  But when I tried to park the vehicle it started shaking, vibrating with a roaring sound, it felt like even the tires ware going to get off the rims!! Making a lot of noice!! I had difficulty steering and parking between two spaces hit the concrete barrier twice or tree times, at that time the steering wheel was to hard to control.  I turn the car off on parked I was puzzled, for what happened.  After five or ten minutes I start the car again place it on reverse then on drive the car was moving very, very, slow with the gas paddle to the floor. Advance to the other side by the Community Center, as I turn left to park, the car started shaking again the steering wheel was very, very hard to control turning left but the force of the tires ware moving right. I was holding on to the steering wheel trying to park again at this time the car completely die on me. By then it was almost 5:00 PM.  I called my insurance to request roadside assistance, and a wrecker service that didn\u2019t arrived. After one hour and half a driver came to help to start the battery, he attempted to start the battery twice. This happened after one of my sons had tried two times too. Finally the car starts again,  after dealing with it for 4 hours. Drove it  for a quarter of a block and died again. The wrecker service came the next day to drive the car to Clear Lake Nissan, they kept the car for two days and supposedly didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it. If this problem had happened on Nassau, road probably I would had been killed. Today the 29th of October, After doing some errands and returning home a symbol of a transmission came on the dashboard while the car was loosing power it hardly made it up to my driveway",

It will do this under normal driving conditions. It has done it while I am driving straight on a street or highway or when I am turning a corner. I have narrowly missed being rear-ended or broad sided when it does it. I took it to Ingram Park Nissan in San Antonio January 2021 and they told me the problem was a bad battery. I had them replace it. (I am an over-the road truck driver and don't drive the car very often since I am usually on the road for 2-3 weeks at a time. There are times that I have only driven the car less than 75 miles when I come home and the car won't always lose power.) The car has continued to have the same problem. I took it in to Ancira Nissan at the manufacturers request on 8-3-21. They diagnosed the problem as being a bad battery and alternator.  I had them replaced and picked up the car on 8-14-21. While driving the car later on in the evening on 8-14-21 I experienced the same problem. Ancira had the car for 11 days and it is still not fixed. I don't know exactly what component or system is failing and Nissan doesn't seem to know as well. When the problem occurs several lights will come on on the dash (traction control, ABS, air bag, seat belt, a triangle with an exclamation point).  There are other Nissan Maxima owners who have posted comments on car websites who are experiencing the same problems. The other owners have said that they have had their cars misdiagnosed by dealers and continue to have the same problem. The problem seems to be mainly happening with 2016 and 2017 Nissan Maximas.

I CALLED LYNCH NISSAN AND TOLD THEM I HAD PURCHASED A CAR WITH RECALL ON IT WITH A FIRE HAZARD AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN ON MONDAY, 02/12/2017. I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE REPAIR AND THEY CALLED ME ON WEDNESDAY, 02/14/2017 TO PICKUP MY CAR. BECAUSE I WAS AT WORK, I ASKED IF I COULD PICK UP THE CAR THE NEXT DAY. I WAS TOLD NO BECAUSE THEY HAD PROVIDED ME A RENTAL CAR AND I HAD TO RETURN IT ON THE DAY THE WORK WAS COMPLETED. ONCE I RETURNED THE RENTAL CAR, I WAS TOLD THE RENTAL CAR WAS FINE. WHEN I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTER I WAS ASKED TO SIGN A PAPER BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAIL ME THE PAPERS STATING WHAT WAS DONE TO MY CAR.   I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED TO SIGNED SOMETHING AND THEN TOLD THEY CAN'T PROVIDE ME A COPY. BECAUSE THIS CAR WAS SOLD TO ME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OF IT HAVING A FIRE HAZARD, I CALLED NISSAN (NESSIE) AND ASKED THEM TO BUY THE CAR BACK AND THEY REFUSED. NISSAN IS NOW SAYING EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BUT I HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION OF WHAT THEY ASKED ME TO SIGN NOR WHAT TYPE OF WORK WAS PERFORMED ON MY CAR.  BECAUSE I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS RECALL BEFORE I PURCHASE THIS CAR AND NOT HAVING A COPY OF WHAT NISSAN ASKED ME TO SIGN, I AM NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR BECAUSE OF THE FIRE HAZARD.",
