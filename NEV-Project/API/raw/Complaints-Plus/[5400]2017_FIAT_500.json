I test drove this car to my home for 3 days before buying it. On day 2 it starting flashing. I returned to the dealer, reported it and was told it would be repaired. I have over 40 Videos on my cel phone that prove its defective over a 4 year period. Most resent issues on, 10/30/21, 11/1/21, 11/10/21. All 3 parties have refused to fix, repair or replace what causes the flashing miles indicator in my car. They said it doesn't exist so there is nothing to fix. The car was sent to the Fiat dealership in Henderson for a few days and they said it didn't flash while there so Fiat, Chrysler and Tobin Fiat of Las Vegas saw it as a none issue or as a customer complaint about nothing.",
