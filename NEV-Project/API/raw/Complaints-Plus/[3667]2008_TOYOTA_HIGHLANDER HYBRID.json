I reversed the car and returned to my driveway. My husband called a friend mechanic shop owner who ran the diagnostic report that showed a C1391code.  I remembered I received a notification letter regarding this issue and called the dealer. Service agent indicated that without Toyota doing the diagnostic run on my vehicle, they could not give me any quote on the price, but notified me that the letter I received had expired on December 31, 2020 or 10 years or 150,000 miles.  My Highlander had this alert screen notification at 144,000 miles. I was told I would be responsible for repair charges.  Feeling very frustrated, I called the Toyota corporate number and spoke to a female who then connected me with a supervisor. I explained my experience and the representative explained the notification letter had expired and was unlike a recall, which was indefinite. I emphasized to him that since Toyota knew this was a problem, how could they put an expiration date on the failed Brake Booster Actuator Pump Assembly  that they clearly knew was a brake problem. Furthermore, Toyota, which I have been a loyal owner of five vehicles, had only allowed one year +  for their accountability to the fixing the brake assembly parts. This meant it was a luck of the draw depending on miles driven for the brake assembly to fail during the little more than a year notification period for Toyota to be responsible for replacing the parts. I find this to be very unfair and unjust.  I voiced my opinion to the 800 number a second time, & was told that if the NHTSA had determined it a recall, no expiration date.  As a senior citizen who is on a fixed income,  I believe Toyota should fix all Brake Booster Actuator Pumps that fail and NHTSA should demand a recall.",

I showed it to the dealership during my 2020 visit and they said my vehicle is not covered. I believed them since I did not see the error again after replacing the 12V battery.

I CALLED TOYOTA, MADE A CLAIM, AND 24HRS LATER I CALLED BACK IN AND WAS DIRECTED TO SPEAK WITH THE WARRANTY DEPARTMENT MANAGER. ALTHOUGH MY APPROACH WAS DIRECT, THOROUGH, AND CALM, HE REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE. HE DEFENDED TOYOTA STATING THAT THEY \"ALREADY WERE BEING VERY GRACIOUS BY EXTENDING THE CLAIM TO BEGIN WITH\" AND THAT \"THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO.\"    I FIND THE FACT THAT TOYOTA RECOGNIZES THEY HAVE USED A FAULTY PART IN THEIR HIGHLANDERS, AND DID NOT LIST IT AS A \"RECALL\" (SO YOU COULD GET IT SWAPPED OUT BEFORE IT CAUSED PROBLEMS) IS RIDICULOUS.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED ONLINE OF BRAKE FAILURE ON THIS VEHICLE AS A RESULT OF THE MALFUNCTIONS OF THE BRAKE ACTUATOR AND BOOSTER PUMP SOME WITH CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.  NO ONE AT TOYOTA HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY REPAIRS ARE NOT COVERED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND INDICATE THAT IT WAS APPARENTLY AN ARBITRARY DATE.

TWO WEEKS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT THE CAR ALSO DISPLAYED THE VSC WARNING SO WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO BEAMAN TOYOTA WHERE WE PAID 1818.60 TO HAVE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WATER PUMP AND DRIVE BELT REPLACED. KNOWING WE WERE GOING ON THE ABOVE TRIP WE HAD ALL THE RECOMMENDED REPAIRS PERFORMED SO WE COULD BE CONFIDENT IN THE CAR DURING OUR TRIP.",

MANY REPORTS ON THE WEB INDICATE CARS PAST THE TOYOTA ARBITRARY CUT OFFS FOR TIME AND MILES.

I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH WATER ON THE ROAD THAT I WAS HYDROPLANING...I WAS SIMPLY SKIDDING ON THE WET PAVEMENT.  I COULD NOT STOP IN TIME TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, SO I STEERED INTO THE EMERGENCY LANE, STILL SKIDDING.  ANOTHER CAR SWERVED INTO THE EMERGENCY LANE SO I TURNED THE WHEEL AGAIN TO SKID INTO THE GRASS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  I WAS NOW SKIDDING SIDEWAYS DOWN A GRASSY EMBANKMENT TOWARDS TREES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EMBANKMENT.  LUCKILY THE CAR FINALLY SKIDDED TO A STOP AND CAME SLOWLY TO REST AGAINST A TREE.

WE ARE A FAMILY WITH 6 KIDS AND OBVIOUSLY DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY. WE CONTINUED DRIVING THE HIGHLANDER UNTIL IT BECAME COMPLETELY UNSAFE. THE BRAKES STOPPED WORKING WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT ONE DAY WITH MY KIDS. THE BRAKES WOULD GO ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND BARELY EVEN STOPPED ME. I MANAGED TO MAKE IT HOME WITHOUT BEING IN A WRECK, BUT WE FEEL THAT IT IS TOTALLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE. IT IS THE ONLY VEHICLE THAT WE HAVE TO TRANSPORT ALL OF OUR FAMILY, AND WE AREN'T SURE WHAT TO DO. MY HUSBAND HAS RESEARCHED AND DISCOVERED THAT THE ABS HAS BEEN RECALLED IN THE 2006 AND 2007 TOYOTA HIGHLANDERS. WE HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO OURS WITH THE 2008 HIGHLANDER.

DUE TO THE SHAPE AND LOCATION OF THE FFC'S RETAINER, THE FFC COULD BECOME DAMAGED WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED.  CONSEQUENCE:  IF THE FFC IS DAMAGED, CONNECTIVITY TO THE DRIVER'S AIR BAG MODULE COULD BE LOST AND THE AIR BAG DEACTIVATED.  2 YRS AGO OUR '08 HIGHLANDER SPORT THE CRUISE CONTROL STARTED ACTING ERRATICALLY, NOT ENGAGING/NOT TURN/OFF USING THE COLUMN MOUNTED STALK. OUR WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, & TIME PASSED, & THE CC BECAME UNRELIABLE, ON A FEW OCCASIONS WAS UNSAFE WHEN IT DID NOT 'CANCEL' PULLING BACK ON THE STALK. I'M HANDY SO I PULLED OFF THE STEERING WHEEL AND TOOK APART THE CLOCK SPRING, DISCOVERED THAT THE SPIRAL CABLE WAS COATED IN A WAXY DIRTY LOOKING BUILDUP & THERE WERE ABRASIONS ON THE FLAT WIRE TAPE, EXPOSING THE COPPER BENEATH, WHICH CRACKED. THIS TO ME IS THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE WIRE TAPE FOR THE VEHICLES IN THE AIRBAG RECALL MENTIONED ABOVE, ONLY THE DAMAGE ON MINE HAPPENED TO THE CC WIRING PORTION AND NOT THE AIRBAG PORTION (OR THE HVAC CONTROLS OR HORN WIRING). I FEEL OUR VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT OUR CLOCK SPRING SHOULD BE REPLACED AS WELL. PLEASE REFER TO THE 2 PHOTOS I ATTACHED. THE ONE SHOWING THE WEAR SPOT, IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT AND ZOOM IN, SHOWS THE EXPOSED COPPER AND CRACK IN IT. THE OTHER PHOTO SHOWS THE LOOP IN THE FLAT ELECTRICAL TAPE WHERE THE WEAR SPOT HAPPENED AS WELL AS THE DIRTY WAXY BUILDUP ON THE TAPE.  THIS SAME WEAR COULD CREEP DOWN TO THE AIRBAG MODULE WIRES IN THIS FLAT TAPE AND MAKE THE AIRBAG SYSTEM SHUT DOWN, CAUSING MORE UNSAFE CONDITIONS FOR MY WIFE AND I. MY VIN SHOULD BE ADDED",

INVESTIGATION OF THE CAR OVER 2 DAYS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN DISCOVERING THE CAUSE.  ON SEPTEMBER 9, I ASKED IF IT WAS THE INVERTER.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER HAD CONTACTED TOYOTA, WHO RECOMMENDED TAKING APART THE HYBRID SYSTEM TO LOOK FOR A SHORTED WIRE.  ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY FOUND A WIRE, WOULD BUT THE SYSTEM BACK TOGETHER, AND WOULD TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.  ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, THE CAR STALLED AND DIED ON THE THIRD TEST DRIVE.  AT THIS TIME, I WAS INFORMED IT WAS THE INVERTER.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AGREED WITH ME IN FEELING THAT SINCE TOYOTA HAD TAKEN OUT AN INVERTER THAT WAS SEEMINGLY WORKING FINE, AND REPLACED WITH ONE THAT FAILED IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS, THAT TOYOTA WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME.  ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15,  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE COST FOR THE PART WAS $8800, AND THAT THE REGIONAL SERVICE/PARTS MANAGER, OFFERED TO PAY HALF OF THE COST FOR REPLACEMENT.  I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS OFFER, AS IT STILL LEFT ME WITH A BILL OF SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A PART THAT FAILED IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS AFTER THE RECALL.  AT THIS TIME, I HAVE NOT ACCEPTED THE OFFER.  I WAS TOLD TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE REGIONAL MANAGER HAD MADE ME AN OFFER, THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SHE COULD DO.  MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT TOYOTA RECALLED MY VEHICLE FOR THE INVERTER.  AND I BELIEVE A BAD INVERTER WAS PUT IT THE CAR INSTEAD.  THIS CURRENT INVERTER, THAT TOYOTA TOLD ME TO PUT IN THE CAR, LASTED APPROXIMATELY 29,000 MILES AND 22 MONTHS.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A FAR CRY FROM THE EXPECTED LIFE OF AN INVERTER.",

THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER THE PAST YEAR AND NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. THE BRAKES ARE NEW AND SEVERAL FORUMS HAVE BEEN READ IN REGARDS TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE. IT SEEMS THAT SEVERAL HYBRIDS EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUES. BRAKING UNDER 30, THE CAR WILL HIT A BUMP, BRAKES WILL RELEASE CAUSING THE CAR TO LUNGE FORWARD AND POSSIBLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. IT HAS HAPPENED ENOUGH THAT OUR FAMILY IS CONSIDERING TRADING IN THE CAR. WE HAVE ALMOST BEEN IN 10 PLUS ACCIDENTS BECAUSE WE ARE ALMOST STOPPED AT THE STOP SIGN AND THE CAR HITS A BUMP AND ACCELERATES INTO TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE LEFT/RIGHT. WITH CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT, THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN. WE HAVE SENT TOYOTA AN EMAIL ASKING FOR INSPECTION, HOWEVER THEY SAID THEY WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE OUR DEALER LOOK AT IT, HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NOTED OF THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST, WHEN CLEARLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN ACCIDENTS.

THE BELT HAD NEVER BEEN USED AND DOES NOT WORK.  I HAVE FILED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH TOYOTA, BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE REPLACEMENT OF MY SEAT BELT, BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE OF MY WARRANTY TIME (# OF MILES).  FIRST, THE BELT HAD NEVER BEEN USED (BECAUSE A CHILD SAFETY SEAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT POSITION SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE).  SECOND, THE # OF MILES DRIVEN HAS NO DIRECT CORRELATION TO HOW OFTEN A REAR SEAT BELT IS USED.  IT MAY HAVE A DIRECT CORRELATION TO HOW OFTEN THE DRIVER'S BELT IS USED, BUT NONE OF THE OTHER POSITIONS.  NOW, THE OTHER SIDE REAR SEAT BELT IS STARTING TO HAVE PROBLEMS...OFTENTIMES IT DOES NOT RETRACT PROPERLY/GETS LOCKED WHEN IT SHOULDN'T, ETC.

THIS SMELL HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT AT HOME, ON OUR TRIP TO THE STORE OR WHEN PARKED THERE.  WHEN I PULLED INTO MY GARAGE, STEAM/SMOKE APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE HOOD. THE DIPSTICK SHOWED VERY LOW OIL.  THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGNS OF AN OIL LEAK IN THE GARAGE BEFORE, BUT, AFTER ARRIVING HOME I SAW A BIG OIL LEAK.    I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP (1/2 MILE FROM HOME) WHO TOLD ME TO BRING IT UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.  BY THE TIME THAT I GOT THERE MY CAR WAS MAKING A SOUND MAKING IT OBVIOUS SOMETHING VERY WRONG.  I PULLED DIRECTLY INTO THE SERVICE BAY.  THE MECHANIC CHECKED THE DIPSTICK WHICH SHOWED ABSOLUTELY NO OIL IN MY ENGINE.  HE PUT IT ON THE HOIST, ADDED OIL, AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE. THE OIL POURED OUT AS FAST AS HE HAD PUT IT IN.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, HE SAW THAT THE LOWER OIL COOLER LINES HAD RUPTURED.  MY ENGINE HAD BEEN CLOSE TO SEIZING.  REPLACING THESE PARTS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE, $437, BUT REPLACING MY ENGINE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.  MORE IMPORTANTLY WAS THAT THE DANGER OF A FIRE FROM THE OIL THAT WAS POURING OUT ON THE HOT ENGINE WAS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP, THE MECHANIC POINTED AT A LEXUS AND STATED, \"THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.  THAT LEXUS SUV IS IN HERE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, THE OIL COOLER LINES RUPTURED.\"  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THIS BE A RECALL ISSUE, AS THE NEW LINES ARE DESIGNED DIFFERENTLY WITHOUT RUBBER FITTINGS, AND WILL NOT RUPTURE.  THIS WOULD INDICATE TO ME THAT TOYOTA HAS NOTICED A DESIGN FLAW IN THE OIL COOLER LINES THAT WERE IN MY HIGHLANDER.    I FEEL THIS OIL COOLER LINES PROBLEM IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESEARCHED AS A POSSIBLE TOYOTA RECALL.  *TR",

THEREFORE, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND THE THEY SAID, \"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKE. IT IS NORMAL AND IS JUST THAT THE BREAK IS SHIFTING.\" HOWEVER, I ASKED THEM WHY THE POPPING SOUND \"ONLY\" CAME FROM THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE. THEY AVOIDED MY QUESTION AND DID NOT ANSWER. AS MY CONCERNS OVER THE BRAKE GREW MORE AND MORE, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE SAME DEALER AGAIN, BUT THEY SAID, \"MY VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I HAVE TO PAY $45 TO HAVE IT RE-CHECKED.\" I TOLD THEM THAT WHEN MY VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED FOR THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE PROBLEM NEVER WENT AWAY; INSTEAD, IT BECAME EVEN WORSE. HOWEVER, THEY STILL INSISTED THAT I HAD TO PAY IN ORDER TO HAVE IT INSPECTED AGAIN. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP.

I STOPPED AT A GAS STATION TO CHECK THE TIRES AND NOTICED A LARGE SCREW STUCK IN MY FRONT LEFT TIRE. MY TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE REGISTERED LESS THAN 5PSI. I FILLED THE TIRE TO AT LEAST 25PSI AND HEADED BACK HOME, FIGURING I COULD PUT THE SPARE ON IN MY GARAGE AND TAKE THE FLAT TO BE  REPAIRED. I WAS GLAD TO GET BACK AS THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM OF THE SEASON WAS AN HOUR AWAY.     THE FAILURE: I WAS ABLE TO GET THE JACK AND OTHER EQUIPMENT OUT OF THE BACK AND SUCCESSFULLY LOWERED THE SPARE TIRE ONTO THE GROUND. MY PROBLEM IS THAT I CANNOT REMOVE THE SPARE TIRE FROM THE CARRIER CABLE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SALT SPRAYED ON THE ROADS RECENTLY AND ALL THE PARTS WERE WHITE. I SPRAYED WITH WD40, BUT NO LUCK. THE MANUAL IS NO HELP AS IT ONLY SHOWS A PICTURE OF THE SPARE AND A ROTATING ARROW. I CAME INSIDE TO LOOK ONLINE TO SEE IF THERE WAS A SOLUTION.. NONE.     I THEN SAW A RECALL LISTED FOR THE 2008-2010 SIENNA (ID# 8250). BECAUSE OF A SAFETY ISSUE WITH SPARE TIRE CARRIER CABLE, IT COULD POSSIBLY BECOME CORRODED AND CAUSE THE SPARE TO FALL OFF FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE. THE RECALL SAYS TO SEE AN AMENDED RECALL FOR JULY 19, 2010. I CAN'T FIND IT. OWNERS WERE TO RECEIVE A LETTER \"WHEN A PERMANENT REMEDY WAS AVAILABLE.\" REPAIRS WERE EXPECTED TO START IN OCTOBER 2010.      I'M THANKFUL I WASN'T OUT TRYING TO UNSUCCESSFULLY REMOVE THE SPARE TIRE IN A SNOWSTORM, BUT A USELESS OWNERS MANUAL, A DEFECTIVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, AND ESPECIALLY A RECALL FOR THE SAME PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ON ANOTHER MODEL WITH NO AMENDED REPAIR INFORMATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. WHY WEREN'T HIGHLANDER OWNERS LIKE ME NOTIFIED AS WELL? HAVE SIENNA VEHICLES BEEN REPAIRED? NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH A FLAT FRONT TIRE TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO GET THE SPARE TIRE TAKEN OFF THE VEHICLE SO I CAN TAKE THE FLAT OFF AND GET IT REPAIRED.

AS OF TODAY, I HAVE 23, 897 MILES ON THE VEHICLE; AND THE TIRES ARE COMPLETELY WORN OUT TO A POINT BELOW THE WEAR BARS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THEY MUST BE REPLACED NOW.  WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN OCTOBER 2008, I PURCHASED THE TOYOTA MAINTENANCE PROGRAM, SO THE TIRES ARE ROTATED AND BALANCED (IF NECESSARY) EVERY 5,000 MILES WHEN I ALSO CHANGE THE OIL.  I AM A 46 YEAR OLD FATHER OF THREE SMALL CHILDREN, WITH NO MOVING VIOLATIONS, TICKETS OR ACCIDENTS. I TELL YOU THIS ABOUT MY LIFE TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF CONSERVATIVE DRIVER THAT I AM.    I HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ONLINE AND HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LOWEST PRICE FOR A SET OF FOUR TIRES AT $759.88, WHICH WILL ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE DURING THE BUY DUE TO THE TPMS SYSTEM, THE NECESSITY FOR AN ALIGNMENT WHEN REPLACING FOUR TIRES, AND TAX.      I REALIZE THAT TIRE REPLACEMENT IS JUST ONE PART OF THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT FOR A VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, TIRES ON A $33,000 VEHICLE SHOULD PROVIDE FAR MORE MILEAGE THAN 24,000 MILES.  IN FACT, IF YOU HAVE THE TIME-I INVITE YOU TO GO THE BLOG TITLED TOYOTA NATION, WHERE ALL OF THE WRITERS CONSISTENTLY MAKE DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT TOYOTA?S CHEAP TIRE SELECTION.  SO MUCH IN FACT, WRITERS DISCUSS VARIOUS METHODS FOR OVERCOMING THE BURDEN OF FINDING A SUITABLE, WELL-PRICED REPLACEMENT WHEN THERE ARE ONLY THREE COMPANIES WHO MAKE THE 245/55-R19.  THOSE COMPANIES ARE TOYO, BRIDGESTONE AND HANKOOK.  MOST WRITERS CONVERT TO A LARGER TIRE OR A SMALLER TIRE WITH NEW WHEELS, WHICH OF COURSE AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE SPEEDOMETER/ODOMETER READINGS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY PERFORMANCE AND POSSIBLY SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.

A FEW MINUTES LATER HE SAID THAT THE BELT WAS GETTING TIGHTER AND I ASKED HIM IF I NEEDED TO STOP AND HE SAID THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.  BEFORE I COULD GET STOPPED (LESS THAT A BLOCK), HE INDICATED THAT HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.  WHEN I LOOKED BACK, I WAS STARTLED TO FIND THAT THE SEAT BELT HAD BECOME WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK AND HAD RATCHETED BACK IN, PINNING HIS NECK BACK AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CAR.  EVEN AFTER STOPPING, I WAS UNABLE TO PULLED THE SEAT BELT OUT TO GET IT OUT FROM AROUND MY SON'S NECK -- HE WAS STRANGLING IN FRONT OF MY EYES.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS IN A CITY WITH RESIDENTS CLOSE BY, ONE OF WHICH HEARD ME SCREAMING AND RUNNING DOOR TO DOOR, WHO BROUGHT OUT A KITCHEN KNIFE TO CUT THE BELT AND RELEASE MY SON.   I REALIZE THAT THESE RATCHET-TYPE SEAT BELTS ARE DESIGNED AS A SAFETY FEATURE IN THE THIRD ROW SEAT OF MANY MAKES AND MODELS, HOWEVER, FEEL THAT THIS DESIGN ALSO PRESENTS A STRANGULATION CONCERN.  IN CASES SUCH AS MINE, THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET THE SEAT BELT RELEASED AND IF THIS HAD OCCUR WHILE ON RURAL ROADS OR THE INTERSTATE, THE AVAILABILITY OF A KNIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO COME BY.  I FEEL THAT EITHER AN EMERGENCY RELEASE BUTTON SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR THE RATCHET SEAT BELTS OR CONSUMERS NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR STRANGULATION AND ADVISED TO CARRY SCISSORS FOR THIS POSSIBILITY.

I PUT THE VEHICLE BACK INTO DRIVE AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  I EVENTUALLY GLIDED TO A SLOW, DIFFICULT STOP.  NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. AFTER A 5 MINUTE REST IN PARK, I STARTED THE CAR AND THE ENGINE RACED.  I IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  AFTER ANOTHER 5 MINUTE DELAY, I STARTED THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND IT APPEARED NORMAL.  I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD OCCURRED.  THE DEALER COULD NOT RECREATE THE EVENT AND DID NOT SEE ANY READOUTS INDICATING WHAT HAD OCCURRED.  THEY EXPLAINED IT AS A ECT TRANSMISSION THAT IS COMMON WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING IS ON.  GIVEN RECENT EVENTS, MY FEAR IT THAT THE EXPLANATION GIVEN TO ME IS NOT ACCURATE.  I CALLED THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST 2 MONTHS TO DETERMINE WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE FOR RECALL AND REPAIR.  THEY CONTINUE TO TELL ME TO WAIT FOR A FLOOR MAT RECALL NOTICE FROM TOYOTA, AND PRIOR TO RECEIVING THAT NOTICE, THEY CANNOT ASSIST.  I CALLED THE NATIONAL TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER 1-800-331-4331 TO FILE AN INCIDENT REPORT.  I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION ABOVE, THEY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER .  THEY INDICATED THAT OUR VEHICLE WAS MADE IN JAPAN AND SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE PEDAL RECALL.  THEY ALSO INDICATED THAT WE SHOULD BE PART OF THE FLOOR MAT RECALL WHICH WILL INCLUDE A COMPUTER CHIP ADJUSTMENT THAT WILL INSTALL A BRAKE OVERRIDE TO ENSURE THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL WILL OVERRIDE THE ACCELERATOR.

I WAS IN TRAFFIC AND THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE.    I PHONED THE NEAREST DEALER, THEY COULD NOT TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OTHER THAN I NEEDED TO GET THERE OR PULL OVER AND STOP.  I WAS LESS THAN 15 MILES AWAY SO I CHOSE TO TRY AND GET THERE SINCE I WAS ABLE TO SLOW THE CAR WITH BREAKS.    I ARRIVED AT THE DEALER AND SAT 3 HOURS BEFORE I HAD ANY DETAIL, WITH MY TWO YEAR OLD.  THEY COULD NOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  THEY ESCALATED THE ISSUE UP THE TOYOTA SERVICE LEVELS.  FINALLY, THEY CAME BACK THAT THERE WAS A SMALL (HAIRLINE)BREAK FLUID LEAK IN THE CAR AND THAT PART WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I WAS JUST OUT OF WARRANTY AT 41,000 MILES AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE PART AND LABOR TO INSTALL.  AFTER 5 HOURS, THEY GAVE ME A RIDE HOME AND DID NOT OFFER A RENTAL CAR.    THE DETAILS I RECEIVED BACK WERE VERY VAGUE AND TO THIS DAY I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE ISSUE BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR, AFTER MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ISSUE - TOYOTA AGREED TO PAY FOR THE PART $1500 BUT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LABOR $600.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY MAY HAVE PAID FOR ALL THE REPAIR (A YEAR AGO) BUT THE FLOOR MAT ISSUE WAS COSTING THEM SO MUCH MONEY THEY WERE NOT PAYING FOR LABOR ANY LONGER.  I FEEL A REPAIR THAT WAS NOT COMMON AND NOT CAUSED MY DRIVING OR LACK OF PROPER MAINTENANCE.  THEY CALLED IT A FLUKE AND THAT IS EVIDENCED BY THE ONLY PLACE THEY COULD FIND THE PART WAS IN CINCINNATI, OHIO WHEN I LIVE IN CA.  IT TOOK MORE THAN A WEEK FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE AND I WAS WITHOUT MY CAR FOR THREE WEEKS AS I HAD NO WAY TO GET BACK THERE.

AND CONTINUE TO CALL AND COMPLAIN.  DEALER STATES THEY HAD EXPERTS LOOK AT CAR, REBOOTED COMPUTER (BECAUSE CAR RESPONDS TO DRIVER THAT DRIVES THE MOST!).  SAID NOTHING IS WRONG OR CAN BE DONE.  DEALER HAS  ADMITTED THAT ENGAGING IS SLOW, NOTICEABLE.  FAILURE TO ENGAGE OCCURS DAILY.  CONSEQUENCE - IN DANGER OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE CAR OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  NOTHING WAS DONE TO REPAIR.  COMPUTER RE-SET. (THIS IS WHAT I WAS TOLD)  VEHICLE ALSO HAS EXPERIENCED TROUBLE WHILE DRIVING UP HILL.  RPM WENT TO 4000 + AND WOULD NOT CHANGE GEARS.  ON FREEWAY AND SLOWING DOWN.  HAD 6 HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS IN CAR.    ALSO HAS \"DROPPED\" INTO GEAR HEAVILY. *TR",

THIS TIRE HAPPENS TO BE THE ONLY TIRE MADE TO FIT THIS RIM OTHER THAN A TOYOTA OPEN COUNTRY WHICH APPARENTLY WAS STANDARD ON THE HYBRID MODEL.  WE FOUND THIS TIRE TO BE UNFIT AND UNSAFE FOR A 4,500 LB VEHICLE OF THIS SCALE.  THESE TIRES HYDROPLAN IN RAIN FROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE NEW, AND THEY HANDLED TERRIBLY IN ANY AMOUNT OF SNOW, CAUSING THE REAR OF OUR 4WD VEHICLE TO SLIDE SIDEWAYS WHEN STARTING FROM SIMPLE STOPS.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE HELD OUR BREATH AS WE SLID TOWARD VEHICLES AND PROPERTY WHILE THE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM TRIED IN VAIN TO OVERCOME THE TIRE'S VERY POOR HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS.  IF YOU GO TO TIRERACK.COM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS TIRE IS RATED EXTREMELY POORLY BY MANY MANY OWNERS OF HIGHLANDERS AND OTHER CARS THAT THEY CAME STANDARD ON.  WHEN I CONTACTED TOYOTA ABOUT THIS, THEY BALKED AT ME, AND COPPED AN ATTITUDE WHEN THEY ASKED IF I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT TOYOTA WAS GOING TO REPLACE MY TIRES FOR ME.  THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE FOR ANY VEHICLE WHICH WILL TRAVEL IN SNOW OR RAIN.  THE FINAL INSULT OF THESE TIRES IS THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS WORN OUT BY 15,000 MILES.  WE MILKED THESE TIRES UNTIL ALMOST 30,000 MILES SINCE I REFUSED TO BUY THE SAME TIRE AGAIN, HOPING SOME OTHER MANUFACTURER WOULD COME ALONG WITH A SIMILAR SIZED TIRE - 245/55-19.  THAT NEVER HAPPENED, SO I WENT WITH A 255 WIDTH TIRE AND BROUGHT A WELL RATED HANKOOK.  I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.  I AM JUST INCENSED THAT TOYOTA COLLUDED WITH BRIDGESTONE TO INSTALL SUCH TERRIBLY CHEAP AND UNSAFE TIRES ON THOUSANDS OF HIGHLANDERS, STRANDING ALL THOSE OWNERS TO SUFFER THE SAME INSTABILITY ISSUES AS WE DID, WHILE THEY DID NOT WORK WITH ANY OTHER TIRE VENDORS TO SUPPLY THIS DISTINCTIVE TIRE DESIGN.  I AM NOT SURE WHO I HOLD IN MORE CONTEMPT - BRIDGESTONE OR TOYOTA.  I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU COULD RESEARCH VEHICLE CRASHES INVOLVING HIGHLANDERS AND FIND MANY CAUSED BY POOR TRACTION.  *TW",

PROJECT THIS VISUAL BLOCK-OUT ACROSS TO A SIDE-STREET INTERSECTION AND IT BLOCKS THE VIEW OF THE ENTIRE SIDE-STREET INTERSECTION AND THEN SOME WHEN TRAVELING ON A FOUR LANE STREET WITH A MERIDIAN IN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS GROSS HAZARD FOR ME AND A VEHICLE IN THE INTERSECTION AND FOR PEDESTRIANS. I HAD ONE COLLISION WHEN LEAVING A CHURCH PARKING LOT ONTO A TWO LANE RURAL ROAD - TRAVELING ABOUT 10 MPH AND THE OTHER VEHICLE WAS STOPPED IN HIS LANE. OCCURRED IN SPRING OF 2008, ABOUT 5 PM - CLEAR SUNNY DAY. I DID NOT SEE HIS CAR - AND THE COLLISION REPAIR COST FOR HIS VEHICLE WAS $2,500 AND FOR MY REPAIR COST WAS $4,000 +-. ALSO, I HAVE HIT THE LOW CONCRETE DIVIDER WITH MY LEFT FRONT TIRE - LOCATED UNDER THE FREEWAY OVERPASS WHEN TURNING - THIS TURN I HAVE DONE 5 DAYS A WEEK FOR 5 YEARS ON THE WAY TO WORK WITH NO PROBLEM UNTIL DRIVING THIS 2008 HIGHLANDER. ALSO, I HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEAR COLLISIONS WITH UNSEEN VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS. AT NIGHT WITH VEHICLE BEHIND ME THE LIGHT GLARE IN THE OUTSIDE MIRROR IS SUCH THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OVER OR AROUND TO SEE A SIDE-STREET INTERSECTION. SIMILAR PROBLEMS EXIST FOR THE RIGHT OUTSIDE MIRROR. TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM THE MIRROR NEEDS TO BE LOWERED.  ALSO, A GAP BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE MIRROR AND THE DOORPOST WOULD BE A MAJOR GREAT HELP.  MY HEIGHT IS 5'-5\" NOT TOO SHORT - BY PUSHING HARD WITH MY LEFT FOOT ON THE FLOORBOARD STEP I AM ABLE TO SEE OVER THE OUTSIDE MIRROR AND GAIN A REASONABLE VIEW OF THE SIDE-STREET INTERSECTION - BUT THIS MOVEMENT TAKES AWAY FROM MY CONCENTRATION AND AGILITY TO DRIVE ON. *TR",

MY WIFE AND GRANDPA WERE BEING PUSHED OVER BY THE OPEN DOORS. MY WIFE WAS ABLE TO CLIMB BACK IN AND HIT THE BRAKES TO STOP THE VEHICLE. GRANDPA WAS KNOCKED OVER ONTO THE GROUND AND BROKE HIS GLASSES. OTHER THAN FREAKING US ALL OUT WE WERE OK.   I AM SURE THIS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HIGH TECH TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A CAR IN 'PARK' SHOULD NOT START ROLLING NO MATTER WHAT. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. IS THIS NORMAL BEHAVIOR? HAVE OTHER PEOPLE SUBMITTED THIS PROBLEM? *TR",
