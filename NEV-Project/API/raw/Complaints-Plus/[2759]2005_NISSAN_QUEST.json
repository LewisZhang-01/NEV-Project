BACK IN 2004 NISSAN ISSUED A TSB REGARDING THIS ISSUE TELLING TECHNICIANS TO MAKE A \"GOODWILL ADJUSTMENT\" TO PUSH BACK REPAIRS OF THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.

I DRIVE MY CHILDREN IN THAT VAN AND BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE VEHICLE TO DRIVE. APPARENTLY NOT.

THE AUTOMATIC SLIDE DOORS WILL NOT STOP FOR SMALL OBJECTS BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS DESIGNED FOR FAMILIES. THESE DOORS WILL REMOVE A CHILD'S FINGER AND THE SWITCH TO INITIATE THE AUTO SLIDE IS LOW, WHERE ONE CHILD CAN PUSH IT WHILE ANOTHER IS GETTING IN, OR HAS THEIR HAND IN THE WAY AND DIDN'T REALIZE THEIR BROTHER PUSHED THE BUTTON. I DID MY OWN LITTLE RESEARCH TEST,  I GOT PENCILS AND EVERYWHERE I PLACED A PENCIL THE DOOR CLOSED WITH THE PENCIL BEING SNAPPED INTO MANY PIECES AND CRUNCHED UP IN THE DOOR. THEN I TRIED THE SAME THING ON MY FRIEND'S HONDA, BUT THE HONDA'S AUTO SLIDE DOORS BOUNCED OFF EVERY TIME. NISSAN ONLY DESIGNED THEIR DOORS TO RESPOND TO LARGE EXTREMITIES. I HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND I AM GOING THROUGH A PROCESS FOR LEMON LAW. I DIDN'T REALIZE THE ISSUES WITH THE VAN IN A FEW DAYS SO I DON'T THINK NISSAN SERVICE WILL RESOLVE ALL THESE ISSUES IN 2 DAYS WITH A SPECIAL NISSAN ENGINEER SENT OUT FROM THE COMPANY AS PART OF MY LEMON LAW PROCESS. AND IN REGARDS TO THE SLIDING DOOR CONCERNS ALL ANYONE WILL SAY IS THAT THE DOORS ARE PERFORMING THE WAY THEY WERE DESIGNED TO.
