TIRE SENT TO SELLER, AND THEY PRONOUNCED IT WAS AN INSTALLATION ISSUE. THIS TIRE WAS SENT TO SELLER, AFTER PURCHASING A NEW ONE.  AFTER 4 TO 5 WEEKS OF DRIVING, A SECOND TIRE (DIFFERENT WHEEL) FROM THE SAME ORIGINAL SET OF 4, FAILED SUDDENLY.  THIS TIRE \"SUDDENLY\" FAILED WITH A \"GUN SHOT\" LIKE NOISE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY.  REVIEW AT THE SERVICE SHOP SHOWED NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THE INSTALLATION.  PICTURES OF THE SECOND TIRE WERE SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER, AND THEY COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS AN INSTALL ISSUE.  I WORK FOR AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING COMPANY, AND HAD ONE OF OUR EXPERT TECHNICIANS REVIEW THE SECOND TIRE.  HE HAS 30 YEARS OF SERVICE EXPERIENCE WITHIN CHRYSLER DEALERSHIPS.  HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS A TIRE DEFECT, HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A FAILURE,  AND STATED THAT THIS TYPE OF FAILURE WOULD NOT HAPPEN DURING INSTALLATION.  THIS WAS BASED ON THE LOOSE CONDITION OF THE STEEL RING ON THE INNER TIRE, AND THE FACT THAT THEIR WERE NO WITNESS TOOL MARKS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRE.   THE ORIGINAL INSTALLER OF THE TIRES ALSO STATED THAT THE RUBBER ON THE INNER BEAD OF THE TIRE WAS \"TOO THIN\" AND OF POOR CONSTRUCTION.   I HAVE THE SECOND TIRE IN MY POSSESSION, AND HAVE REQUESTED THE ORIGINAL FIRST TIRE BACK FROM THE SELLER.  I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THIS, NOR HAVE I RECEIVED ANY FORMAL CONCLUSIVE REPORT WITH MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS TO PROVE THEIR CONCLUSION.  RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ONLY STATING THEIR PERSONAL OPINION, WITHOUT THOROUGH ANALYSIS.  I AM STILL DRIVING ON THE REMAINING TIRES WITH AN \"UNEASY\" FEELING THAT I AM AT RISK OF ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  I AM ONLY AFTER THE TRUTH IN THIS MATTER, AND UP TO NOW HAVE FELT AS THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN PRESENTED.  I DIDN'T CREATE THIS FAILURE, AND I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING HOW THE INSTALLER, WHO DOES THIS FOR A LIVING, COULD HAVE DONE IT TO 2 TIRES.  *TR",

THE POWER WINDOWS HAVE FAILED, ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN FREE REPAIR OF THE WINDOWS WITH A REVISED RETAINING CLIP, AS THIS PROBLEM OCCURS FAR TOO OFTEN, AND FINALLY, THE REAR BRAKE PADS HAVE WORN COMPLETELY WITH THE FRONT PADS IN VIRTUALLY NEW CONDITION.

HOW CAN A PART THAT HAS BEEN RECALLED NOT BE COVERED FOR MY VEHICLE THAT HAS THE SAME PART?  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OWNERS OUT THERE THAT ARE BEING TALKED INTO UNNECESSARY REPAIRS AND SIDETRACKED FROM THE REAL ISSUE AND ARE NOT AWARE OF THE RECALLS OR SIMPLY DO NOT FILE COMPLAINTS.

I WOULD DRIVE AT 40 MPH OR BE AT A STOP SIGN AND EITHER WAY THE CAR WOULD JUST DROP ALL POWER.  I LOST CONTROL OF STEERING AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WOULD HAVE TO RESTART THE CAR WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  THE 1ST TIME I WAS TOLD THAT A 40,000-MILE TUNE UP WOULD FIX THE SITUATION.  IT OCCURRED AGAIN AFTER THE TUNE ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, AND I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS AN O2 SENSOR AND THE MASS FLOW SENSOR THAT HAS PROBLEMS.  THEY PAID FOR THE MASS FLOW SENSOR AND IT'S LABOR AND I PAID FOR THE O2 SENSOR AND IT'S LABOR.  AFTER THE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT IT OCCURRED (WITH IN THE SAME WEEK); THEY SAID IT WAS ANOTHER O2 SENSOR AND THEY PAID FOR THE LABOR WHERE I PAID FOR THE PART.  ON THE FOURTH VISIT, THEY SAID THAT IT WAS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND ONE OF THE 2 O2 SENSORS THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED HAD GONE BAD AGAIN.  THEY PAID FOR BOTH OF THESE ISSUES AND ASSURED ME THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.   IT WASN'T THE NEXT TIME THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR.  AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION I ASKED THEM TO DRIVE IT AND MAKE SURE AS THE ALTERNATOR THEY WANTED ME TO BUY WAS $700.  THEY CALLED BACK A WEEK LATER AND SAID THEY WERE WRONG IT WAS THE BATTERY INSTEAD AND THAT I OWED THEM $125.  I PAID BECAUSE I WAS TOO TIRED TO ARGUE ANYMORE.  THAT WAS ON 8/9/03.  ON 10/6/03 THE CAR DIED AGAIN.  THEY ARE NOW SAYING IT IS THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THAT IT WAS CAUSING THE BATTERY TO DRAIN (MEANING TO ME, I MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED TO PURCHASE A NEW BATTERY 2 MONTHS AGO).  THEY WANTED ME TO PAY FOR THE PART AND HALF THE LABOR BECAUSE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY (ONLY CAME WITH 2/24K).  STARTING TO WONDER WHAT WILL THEY BLAME IT ON (AND CHARGE ME FOR) NEXT MONTH.

THE JETTA'S FUEL LINE RUNS IN A SHALLOW CHANNEL UNDER THE CAR, BUT I WAS ON A SMOOTH, PAVED STREET AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE AND DON'T RECALL HITTING A POTHOLE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE DAMAGE. TWO THOUGHTS: DESPITE BEING IN A CHANNEL, CLEARANCE ON THE JETTA IS LOW AND THE FUEL LINE IS RATHER EXPOSED, SO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SCRAPED OR DAMAGED AT SOME OTHER TIME...PERHAPS BY ROAD DEBRIS OR DRIVING OVER A SPEED BUMP OR POTHOLE. THE ONLY OTHER LOGICAL EXPLANATION WOULD BE A DEFECTIVE FUEL LINE. IF THE FORMER, THEN VW SHOULD CONSIDER A RECALL TO RELOCATE THE FUEL LINE IN THIS MODEL OR INSTALL SOME TYPE OF SHIELDING. IF THE LATTER, THEN VW SHOULD REPLACE AND UPGRADE THE FUEL LINE IN THIS MODEL.
