THIS WAS SCARY AND NEARLY DISASTROUS, BECAUSE WITH THE CAR ROLLING BACKWARD, IT IS A DUKES OF HAZARD MOVE TO JUMP BACK IN THE CAR WHILE GETTING IMPACTED BY THE DOOR, THEN LAUNCHING INTO THE SEAT AND HITTING THE FOOT PEDAL BRAKE.

THERE WAS NO APPARENT ROCK STRIKE OR OTHER DAMAGE OTHER THAN THE CRACK.  AT THE TIME I DID NOT KNOW THAT HONDA HAD SETTLED A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT ALLEGING DESIGN DEFECTS WITH 2003 AN 2004 HONDA ELEMENTS.  I DID NOT REPORT THE DAMAGE TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EXTERNAL DAMAGE.  I HAD THE OEM WINDSHIELD REPLACED WITH A PPG WINDSHIELD AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO OUR HOME IN JUNEAU, ALASKA AND ARRIVED LAST WEEK.  THIS AFTERNOON WHILE FUELING THE VEHICLE I NOTICED ANOTHER CRACK IN THE WINDSHIELD, THIS ONE STARTING AT THE TOP AT THE EXTREME RIGHT (PASSENGER) SIDE.  THIS CRACK IS NOW ABOUT 8 INCHES LONG, AND WILL SOON BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE REQUIRING REPLACEMENT.  HONDA DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO REPLACE THIS WINDSHIELD BECAUSE ONLY 2003 AND 2004 HONDA ELEMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT.  OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A DESIGN OR ENGINEERING FLAW IN ALL ELEMENTS, NOT JUST THE 2003 AN 2004 MODEL YEARS.  IN CHECKING ON THE INTERNET I FOUND THAT THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AFFECTING THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF ELEMENTS.  WHEN I HAD THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED IN SPRINGFIELD, MO., I WAS TOLD THAT HONDA ELEMENTS CONSTITUTE A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR WORKLOAD, AND THAT SOME ELEMENT OWNERS HAVE REPLACED THEIR WINDSHIELDS FIVE OR SIX TIMES!

IT WAS A NORMAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DAY, SUNNY, CLEAR AND HOT.   AFTER ABOUT 40 MINUTES OF MY 1 HOUR COMMUTE THE DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING DEPLOYED WITH A EXTREMELY LOUD AND DISORIENTING BANG! I WAS QUITE STARTLED BY THE DEPLOYMENT BUT WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. WHEN THE BAG WENT OFF MY LEFT ARM WAS RESTING ON THE WINDOW LEDGE. I RECEIVED A NASTY WELT ON MY UPPER FOREARM AS A RESULT OF THE BAGS SUDDEN DEPLOYMENT.  I THEN PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY TO INSPECT MY VEHICLE. I FOUND NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE ON THE EXTERIOR  AND NONE ON THE INTERIOR EXCEPT FOR THE RATHER LARGE RIP IN MY DRIVERS SIDE SEAT AND THE NOW DEPLOYED AIRBAG HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF MY SEAT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ON SATURDAY LEFT IT FOR THE TECH TO EVALUATE. I WAS CALLED THAT AFTERNOON AND INFORMED THAT I WOULD NEED TO BRING IT BACK AND LEAVE IT DURING THE WEEK SO THEY COULD CONSULT THE CORPORATE ADVISORS/SPECIALIST IN THE MATTER. I RETURNED THE CAR ON TUESDAY AUG 1 2006 FOR THE EVALUATION. I RECEIVED A CALL LATER IN THE DAY INFORMING ME THAT HONDA WOULD NOT BE REPAIRING THE VEHICLE AS I HAD HIT OR RUN OVER SOMETHING CAUSING THE DEPLOYMENT.   AS I SAID EARLIER THERE WAS NO IMPACT AND NOTHING WAS RUN OVER PRIOR TO THE DEPLOYMENT. I HAVE OWNED THE CAR SINCE MILE 7 ON THE ODOMETER AND HAVE BEEN THE ONLY DRIVER FOR IT'S 18000 MILES.    I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS OCCURRENCE. I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND AVOID AN ACCIDENT. MAYBE THE NEXT PERSON THIS HAPPENS TO WONT. I DON'T WANT THIS TO GO UNDOCUMENTED FOR FUTURE VICTIMS.  ALSO, I DON'T THINK A SENSOR SHOULD BE PLACED ANYWHERE UNDER THE VEHICLE WHERE IT COULD BE STRUCK AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL DEPLOYMENT ANYWAY!*JB",
