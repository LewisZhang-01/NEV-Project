More concerning is, on several occasions the brakes seem to fail, initiating the ABS system while in fast food lines. This has also occurred while backing up causing the pedal to be jammed to the floor to stop the vehicle.  The excessive need for pressure while braking was supposed to be fixed in 2021 by a \"simple\" recall that simply updated the computer. I had this recall performed, but still have the same braking issues in my 2015 Chevrolet Suburban. I feel that this is a very serious concern and should be addressed. The difference is truly night and day between my wife's vehicle and mine.  The braking issue comes with no warnings or alarms.

The brake pedal would vibrate when pressed going at slow speed or when reversing for weeks leading up to the break failure; however, no service message would appear on the dashboard instrument panel.  On December 17, 2021 my wife was driving when someone in another vehicle crossed the highway right in front of her, when she pressed the brakes, they were very hard to press and the 2015 Suburban was not able to stop.  Fortunately, she barely missed colliding with the other vehicle.  She was able to coast to a slow speed and pull over into the grass and glide to a stop because the brakes would not work.  This was the first time that a \"Service Brake Assist\" message appeared on the dashboard instrument panel.  We had the Suburban towed to the nearest Chevrolet dealership.  In researching the problem, there has been a recall issued for this type of failure of the brakes for 2015-2018 Chevrolet Suburbans; however, there is no recall for our Suburban according to the VIN #.  Failure of the braking system on a vehicle is very dangerous and can result in injury or death.  I strongly believe our vehicle, and other vehicles like ours, should be added to the recall list as soon as possible before someone gets seriously injured or dies due to not being able to stop and crashing into another vehicle, person, or object.  The Chevrolet dealership says that since our vehicle is not on the recall list, we are responsible for the charges to fix it; however, I believe that the manufacturer (Chevrolet) should pay for the expenses since this seems to be a defect of the parts that are failing, especially since the Suburban is only 6 years old and has less than 100,000 miles.",

This wear has resulted in raw fuel pouring over the top of the fuel tank and producing a significant risk to life and health from fire and inhalation. The fumes from the raw fuel could be smelled through the A/C vents while driving highway speed (inhalation hazard). Once the vehicle is turned off the fuel leak subsides. However, while idling in park the fuel leak would puddle under the vehicle resulting in a significant and potentially catastrophic fire hazard. While researching the symptoms of my issue, I discovered many complaints of the exact symptoms and findings that I have discovered.  I spoke over the phone with a service department employee of a local GM dealership who denied having addressed this issue on other vehicles similar to mine (2015 Suburban LT). I will bring the worn-through fuel feed line to this same dealership to inquire about possible mitigation for this known issue (See service bulletin 17-NA-304). The symptoms that I first noticed were a hard start and the smell of raw fuel in and around the vehicle. No check engine light or other warning messages were displayed to alert me of this failure.",

I saw smoke leaking and rolling out from the bottom of my vehicle. I had shift the vehicle off and inspected thoroughly. I couldn\u2019t see and understand where this was coming from. It wasn\u2019t the engine block and no check engine lights had come on.   So I let the vehicle cool and started her up. No issue until I was a mile or two from my family summer rental and all of a sudden the vehicle felt as though it slipped out of gear. I was left without any power and realized I was smoking again.   I pulled or what I would call drifted to the break down lane and pulled my little man out of the vehicle.   This happened on Saturday and after almost a week in the shop, the dealership sprung me a nice $5200 price for a transmission.   I am now looking and seeing two different recalls for this vehicle. Ironically the these two issues look exactly like the two recalls they have for the power train.

I TOOK IT TO EAGLE BUICK GMC IN CRYSTAL RIVER AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE 2 FUEL LINES ON THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. IT WAS APPROX $680.00 TO FIX. WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THE VEHICLE I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS IS PRETTY COMMON AND IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW. THE GAS LINES RUB AGAINST THE CHASSIS AND GET A HOLE IN THEM.  I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE A RECALL.",

HARD PEDAL / COMPROMISED BRAKES LASTED ~4 MINUTES BEFORE CONDITION \"CORRECTED\" ITSELF. THIS OCCURRED 4/19/2019.     I'VE DRIVEN VEHICLES WITHOUT POWER BRAKES (BY DESIGN).

WE WERE FORCED TO ABANDON THE VEHICLE, PARK IT OVERNIGHT AND TOW IT TO THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER THE NEXT MORNING. BRAKES APPEARED TO WORK FOR TECH AT FIRST, BUT UPON FURTHER INSPECTION AND AFTER A CALL TO US FOR MORE INFO, THE VACUUM PUMP WAS SAID TO BE FAILING, LOSING BREAK POWER AFTER A COUPLE PRESSES OF THE PEDAL (HINTS WHY THIS FAILURE OCCURRED IN STOP-GO TRAFFIC). VACUUM PUMP IS BEING REPLACED AS WE SPEAK, BUT WE STILL DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT CAN HAVE THIS MANY SAFETY ISSUES AT THIS PRICE POINT AND AT THIS AGE; BRAKES, VIBRATION AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS A.K.A THE \"CHEVY SHAKE\" THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED OR ACKNOWLEDGED BY CHEVROLET AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS TO DEALER, TIRE RECALLS, AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE A/C DUE TO FAILURES (AND IT DID FAIL AT 36,000), AND NOW A POWER STEERING RECALL, JUST TO NAME A FEW.",

I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT A VEHICLE WITH JUST OVER 40 THOUSAND MILES WOULD NEED NEW BRAKES, BUT WE HAD THE WORK DONE. THE DEALER ALSO WANTED TO REPLACE THE VACUUM HOSE WHICH POWERS THE BRAKE SYSTEM. THIS WORK WAS ALSO DONE. NEXT, ON FRIDAY MARCH 23, 2018 WE WERE TRAVELING ON AN INTERSTATE AT A HIGH SPEED WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPRESS. WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE NOT TO CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A DEALER AND RENT A CAR. THE FOLLOWING WEEK WE WERE CONTACTED BY THE DEALER DOING THE REPAIRS. OUR SUBURBAN HAD A VACUUM PUMP FAILURE. THIS CAUSED TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE. AFTER SOME RESEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT THIS VEHICLE'S ENGINE DOES NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH VACUUM TO POWER THE BRAKES (UNLIKE EVERY OTHER VEHICLE ON THE ROAD). IN ANY OTHER CAR THE ONLY WAY YOU LOSE SUCTION FOR YOUR BRAKES IS IF THE ENGINE STOPS. IN OUR SUBURBAN THE ENGINE CAN BE RUNNING FINE AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BRAKES. THE WARNING SYSTEM IS TOTALLY USELESS AS IT ISN'T TRIGGERED UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE WITHOUT ANY WARNING. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAVING VACUUM PUMP REPLACED THE DEALER ALSO EXPLAINED THAT ALL FOUR MAGNETIC RIDE SHOCKS/STRUTS WERE LOCKED IN PLACE AND NOT FUNCTIONING AT ALL. THIS IS ANOTHER SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SHOCKS \"LOCKING UP\" . AFTER SOME MORE RESEARCH, I FOUND THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR GM VEHICLES. A PROBLEM THAT GM HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS.

AS I APPROACHED SLOWING TRAFFIC WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON, I TAPPED THE BRAKES TO DISENGAGE THE CRUISE CONTROL, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS RIGID AND COULD NOT BE DEPRESSED.  TO AVOID A COLLISION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED I SWERVED ONTO THE RIGHT SHOULDER WHILE USING TWO LEGS TO AGGRESSIVELY PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN - ALL THE WHILE FEELING VERY LITTLE BRAKING ACTION.  THE CAR CAME TO A STOP AFTER ABOUT 75 METERS.  AT NO TIME BEFORE OR DURING THE EVENT DID THE CAR SIGNAL A BRAKING SYSTEM PROBLEM.  IN FACT IT STILL SHOWED NO SYSTEM INDICATOR OF A BRAKE PROBLEM 3 DAYS LATER WHEN IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS.  THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED, HAVING JUST UNDERGONE A 60K MILE SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE LACK OF THE VEHICLE'S RECOGNITION THAT A CRITICAL FAILURE IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM HAD OCCURRED POSED A SERIOUS AND IMMEDIATE THREAT TO PASSENGERS AND SURROUNDING TRAFFIC.  AS A PHYSICIAN I CAN ATTEST THAT A COLLISION AT THAT SPEED WOULD HAVE SEVERELY INJURED OR EVEN KILLED THOSE INVOLVED. THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 2015 CHEVY SUB HAS REPORTED TO NHTSA BEFORE - THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT. THE SERVICE CENTER REPORTED TO ME THAT A VACUUM PUMP FAILURE WAS TO BLAME - I BELIEVE THIS IS A MORE COMPLEX ENGINEERING PROBLEM IN THAT THE VEHICLE DID NOT DETECT A PROBLEM DESPITE THE FAILURE CREATING A LIFE THREATENING SCENARIO.  ALTHOUGH I PLAN TO IMMEDIATELY DISPOSE OF THIS CAR, FAILURE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY THE MANUFACTURER WILL PUT OTHERS AT RISK IN THE FUTURE.  GM APPEARS TO HAVE ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN THAT REFERS TO THIS PROBLEM (ATTACHED). I SINCERELY BELIEVE THIS DEFECT WILL RESULT IN LIVES LOST IF LEFT UNADDRESSED.

IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO HAVE BOTH OF MY FRONT SHOCKS CHANGED WITHIN 1 AND 1/2 YEAR. I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS BEEN HAVING THESE PROBLEMS, SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS HAVE ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL. WE HAVE ALL SENT FORWARD A COMPLAINT FOR THE NOISE AND SUSPENSION PROBLEMS. I BELIEVE IT CAN BE UNSAFE IN THE FUTURE IF IT IS NOT TAKEN CARE OF. THE STEERING WHEEL MAKES A LOT OF CLINKING NOISE WHEN TURNING. WE WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD TO REPLACE THE STEERING WHEEL COLUMN WITHIN A MERE 20K MILES. THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE SHOCKS OR  STEERING WHEEL.
