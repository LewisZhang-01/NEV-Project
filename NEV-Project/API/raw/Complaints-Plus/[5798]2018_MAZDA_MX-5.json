        "summary": "I'VE OWNED MY 2018 MAZDA MX-5 FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. THE PROBLEMS SLOW STARTED ARISING. AT FIRST I HADN'T NOTICED, BUT WHEN GOING IN AND OUT OF 'DRIVE' THE VEHICLE FELT LIKE IT WAS EITHER GOING TO STALL OR ACCELERATE. I HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS BECAUSE IT'S A 'SPORTS CAR.' IN AUGUST OF 2020 THE WINDOW REGULATOR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE HAD MALFUNCTIONED. FAST FORWARD TO DECEMBER 2020, THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW REGULATOR HAS MALFUNCTION AS WELL. I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH AS TO WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO A VEHICLE THAT'S ABOUT 2 YEARS OLD. I'VE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE OCTOBER OF 2018. INTERNET FORUMS SUGGESTED FAULTS WITH THE ELECTRICAL WIRING. I'VE INFORMED THE MAZDA OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF THESE ISSUES AND INFORMED THEM OF THE INCONVENIENCE. MAKE NOTE I HAVE ONLY MADE A COMPLAINT TO THE WINDOW REGULATORS FAILING. I'VE PROVIDED THEM WITH MY VIN AND YET TO HEAR FROM THEM SINCE. IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME TO DO RESEARCH ON MY VIN, SO I DID AND MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN AFTER APOLOGIZING FOR POSSIBLY BEING RUDE, I FIND THAT MY VEHICLE HAS HAD A SERIOUS RECALL SINCE FEBRUARY 01ST OF 2019. A YEAR AND 10 MONTHS AND NO RECALL NOTICE WHAT SO EVER! SHOULDN'T THE DEALERSHIP KNOW OF THE PROBLEMS! SERIOUSLY I COULD HAVE DIED! I QUOTE, DIRECTLY FROM NHTSA, 'THE SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DOWNSHIFT WHILE DRIVING MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE STABILITY OF THE VEHICLE, AND COULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A CRASH.' THIS IS INCREDIBLY DEPRESSING, SINCE THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. THEY HAD CLOSE TO 2 YEARS TO INFORM ME OF THIS RECALL AND I HAD TO FIND OUT MYSELF.",
