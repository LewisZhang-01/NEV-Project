IN THE SAME TIME FRAME WE STARTED NOTICING THE VEHICLE WOULD SHIFT HARD FROM PARK TO REVERSE AT VARIOUS TIMES. CONTACTED DEALER AND SCHEDULED A APPOINTMENT.

I INSISTED THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND WENT FROM SERVICE TO SALES PERSON WHO HAS SOLD ME MY LAST 4 VEHICLES.  HE TALKED WITH TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AND SAID HE KNEW WHAT TO DO.  SO THEY FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.  I WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE THAT IS A 40K MILE REQUIREMENT, NOT 15K MILE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT FROM TIME TO TIME THE FLUID FROM FACTORY IS INCORRECT.  SO I ACCEPTED.    2ND TIME SAME SHUTTER AND FLUID FLUSHED AGAIN    3RD TIME SAME SHUTTER, SHIFTS HARD, JERKING, VIBRATION WHEN IDLE, FUEL MILAGE DECREASE AND POWER LOSS AND HESITATION WHEN TRYING GO.  CHANGED TORQUE CONVERTER AND FLUSHED FLUID AGAIN. REPROGRAMMED TRANSMISSION.    4TH TIME SAME SHUTTER AND VIBRATION.  CHANGED FLUID, REPLACED MOTOR MOUNTS.  NOTHING TO THE HESITATION OR HARD SHIFTING.    FINAL TIME HAVE BEEN TOLD NOTHING CAN DUPICATE.  WE ARE STILL HAVING SHUTTER AND THE WORST OF ALL IS THE HESTIATION.

THEY SAID GM SAID THE TORQUE CONVERTER WAS OUT OF BALANCE AND GM WAS DESIGNING A FIX . ABOUT 5 CALLS AND THREE WEEK LATER THEY RECEIVED A NEW SPECIAL TORQUE CONVERTER AND AFTER IT WAS INSTALLED THE VIBRATION WAS STILL THERE. YOU CAN FEEL THE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL, THROTTLE, CENTER CONSOLE, FLOOR, AND THE SEAT. THE SERVICE MANAGER HAS BEEN VERY POLITE AND HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO HELP. A GM FIELD SERVICE REP HAS LOOKED AT THE CAR AND SAID IT IS WITHIN GM SPEC,S. I AM READING ALL OVER THE INTERNET OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND GM HAS REPLACED DRIVELINES, WHEELS,  TIRES, TORQUE CONVERTERS, SHOCKS, REAR AXLES, ENGINE MOUNTS, ETC. AND STILL HAVE A VIBRATION PROBLEM. THEY HAVE EVEN BOUGHT SOME OF THE 2015 AND 2016 BACK. THIS IS HAPPENING ON ALL GM FULL SIZE SUV'S. CHEVROLET, GMC, AND CADILLAC.",

CAN FEEL STRANGE EAR PRESSURE LIKE THE STEREO SUBWOOFER IS PLAYING OVER MOST SMALL ROAD IMPERFECTIONS. THE WHOLE BODY \"BOOMS\"  EXHAUST DROANING SOUND AND EAR PRESSURE. WHEN SUV SWITCHES INTO V4 MODE EXHAUST CREATES A DROANING BACK PRESSURE SOUND WHICH ALSO CREATES PRESSURE IN  OCCUPANTS EARS RIDING IN VEHICLE.     NOTE* GM BOUGHT BACK OUR 2015 YUKON AND 2015 ESCALADE FOR THESE EXACT PROBLEMS. THE 2016 IS NO BETTER. ALL THE SAME SOUND AND EAR PRESSURE ISSUES. HAVE CONTACTED GM AND STARTED A CLAIM. AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO FIX, CORRECT, OR REPLACE THIS VEHICLE. AT THIS POINT I HAVE PURCHASED OVER $220.000.00 IN JUST OVER ONE YEAR FROM GM, THREE NEW SUV'S THEY ALL MAKE THESE NOISES. DURING THIS TIME, HAVE BEEN IN COUNTLESS 2015 LOANER SUBURBAN'S, TAHOE'S, YUKON'S AND ESCALADE'S EVERYONE OF THIS VEHICLES HAS THIS NOISE ISSUE TO SOME DEGREE. SOME BETTER, SOME WORSE.",
