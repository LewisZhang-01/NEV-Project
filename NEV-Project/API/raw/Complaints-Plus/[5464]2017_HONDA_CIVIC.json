        "summary": "I am reaching out regarding an issue in my 2017 Honda Civic EX-T. Over the past few months, I have noticed that the steering wheel seems to \"stick\" or feel \"notchy\" when making small adjustments from center (12 o clock) position. This is most noticeable when driving on a long, straight stretch of freeway requiring minor adjustments to keep the car centered. The steering will stick when attempting to making small corrections, requiring extra force to overcome resistance. After providing more force, the steering will suddenly give way, typically causing overcorrection in the opposite direction. As a result, I have to weave back and forth in my lane to keep the car straight. This issue is most pronounced when the ambient temperature is hot, and the car has been driven for at least 20-30 minutes. Interestingly, the issue will disappear if the weather is cooler or if the car is driven for short distances in the city.  I have brought the car to a shop before, but they were unable to reproduce the issue. It is hard to reproduce because the car needs to be driven for 20-30 minutes, preferably on the highway, before the steering stiffness occurs.   It appears that this is a well-known issue at this point, and I have seen multiple reports online about the issue. From what I understand, the only fix at this point is to replace the EPS steering rack (part 53650-TBC-A02). However, it seems that some people have had the issue reoccur even after replacing the rack.  I believe this issue is a major safety concern. The steering becomes unpredictable when driving in a straight line. I am forced to constantly overcorrect and weave back and forth when driving on the highway at 70+ mph, thus dramatically increasing the risk of an accident. There needs to be some sort of safety recall for this issue, as it seems to be a manufacturer issue with the EPS motor that has affected several vehicles.",

Driver discomfort can compromise the safe operation of a vehicle. A comfortably cooled cabin is essential for safe vehicle operation. Inhaling leaking  refrigerant gas in a closed cabin is unhealthful and unsafe. Honda has built and delivered Civics with defective air conditioning components and then as these parts failed, the Civic owners have to pay for essential repairs. Honda did replace the condenser on this vehicle at no cost on 6/8/2020. The recent replacement of the evaporator and actuator valve did come at a discounted cost of $1,537.50. I appreciate the technicians that repaired the car.  The failure of the condenser and the evaporator are indicative of the defective and deficient quality of the parts used and are a harbinger of more related parts to fail, namely the compressor, all tubing and related seals, and the dryer. These parts are not covered under any warranty. The only parts of reliable value are the knobs and buttons on the dashboard.   I was not able to get possession of the evaporator that was removed because I did not make the request when the service order was written. It would have been helpful to evaluate the part for failure. I am not sure why Honda does not care to evaluate failed parts.  The remedy for all affected Civic owners would be for the NHTSA to direct Honda USA to immediately remove every air conditioning component and replace the entire system with a highly reliable OEM quality air conditioning system that is immune from failure. The cost of this resolution would be paid entirely out of Honda executive management compensation.   The NHTSA and Honda USA need to understand that safety cannot be compromised! There will be a declining demand for Honda cars made with deficient and defective parts",

I find out and she goes to CarMax with the estimate and they replace everything. We break up I come back get in the car AC doesn't work. Now I'm in lake city, go to Honda, this is were you need to pay attention. The condenser was replaced, for free, they said it was $150 to find the problem. Had my 45k mile service done as well. Show up at the dealership and my cost? $0  To my shock the service manager was honest. The condenser is under Honda warranty. They waved the $150 cause I told them it couldn't be the compressor, had to be the condenser. And the they gave me the oil change for free. Do not let Honda service around the country charge you for the problem they already know. $300, to $700 estimates? Shameful. Go to Honda tell them it's the condenser. If the AC seems to blow out of 1 vent cold while the rest warm, or the AC is cold when it's still cool outside, or even hearing a slight hiss under the hood. It's the condenser. Tell them you want the condenser changed. Nothing else! You have control of what they fix on your car. They know what's wrong without lifting the hood. My AC is ice cold. Took 3 years but it works. You don't have to be charged for diagnosis. And everyone that was cheated and treated unfairly there is a Honda number of they're US home office. Call tell them. I was told by the service manager that $150 is the highest they go. Why? Cause they have to remove the front bumper just to check. So be specific. I need the condenser replaced.",

        "summary": "The AC in my '17 Honda Civic Hatchback went out and I took it to the local dealership (where purchased) to have it diagnosed.  Upon review, they informed me the AC's evaporator unit is leaking and it will cost $2K to replace.  I'm aware there is a recall (TSB 19-091) on the condenser from 2016-2018 Civics.  Honda came out with a TSB regarding this issue, all 2016-2018 civics have 10yr/unlimited mile warranties now on condensers. TSB 19-091, dated Dec 11th 2019.  Per the bulletin: \" American Honda is extending the warranty on the A/C condenser to 10 years from the original date of purchase with unlimited miles. This warranty only covers vehicles that have a defective A/C condenser from the factory. The A/C condenser was not manufactured to specification. As a result, tiny holes may develop in the condenser tube walls that allows the refrigerant to leak out. \"  However, there seems to be an equally large number of complaints online about compressors and evaporators failing in those years of Civic as well.  As such, it turns out failure across ALL the components of the AC system (compressors/condensers/evaporators) is relatively common after only a handful of years.  I believe an amended bulletin should be provided to cover ALL repairs across the AC system.    As a Father, with two kids under the age of 2, it's not suitable for them to ride in a vehicle without AC.  Especially with the 100+ temps we get in the middle of Kansas in Summer.  Additionally, the lack of a function AC debilitates the function of the Defrost making it extremely dangerous to drive in foggy, rainy, and/or humid conditions.  There are multiple articles explaining these exact malfunctions as well:  https://www.civicx.com/forum/threads/2016-2019-evaporator-failures-leaks.52319/  https://www.reddit.com/r/Honda/comments/lyne6q/2017_honda_civic_ac_evaporator_leaking/?utm_source=BD&utm_medium=Search&utm_name=Bing&utm_content=PSR1  There were no warnings prior to my AC going out.",

This does not put my safety at risk but I do see that Honda has had this problem with many of their vehicles in recent years. This problem was reported to American Service Honda on June 4 2021, but because I am days past the expiration date of warranty Honda refuses to diagnose the issue without cost to me. I did not immediately report it when first noticed because I had not realized how recent this car was purchased. But like stated prior, Honda has confirmed the same issue for other of their models in recent years. I have owned other vehicles like toyotas and other brands to which do not have the same issue so it is not due to sun damage nor wear. Another issue is that the window trims on all passenger and driver windows are breaking shrinking and falling apart.  Again this is also known problem with honda cars in consumer reports.org all throughout the U.S . This may be of safety concern if they fall off while driving I wouldn't want it to land on another cars front window or perhaps the windows can be damaged or cracked. One last thing that is also a common issue for hondas, that is an issue for mine is that the front bumper is very low it gets stuck on parking bumpers this causes the sides to start breaking and if it were to fall off it would be a major safety concern.",

DROVE THE CAR BACK STILL BROKEN, WITH ALL SAFETY FEATURES NOT WORKING, WARNING LIGHTS ON, AND THE ALARM CONTINUES TO SET ITSELF OFF. HAD TO DISCONNECT BATTERY AND IT HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GARAGE UNUSABLE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW, FOR IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. ATTEMPTED VARIOUS TIMES TO CONTACT CORPORATE HONDA FOR HELP WITH THIS ISSUE, YET THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT IS GOING ON AND WILL NOT RESPOND. PLEASE HELP, THIS CAR IS UNSAFE AND MUST BE RECALLED. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR HONDA TO OWN UP? IT SEEMS SAFETY IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THEM. IT IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR THE CAR IS CONTROLLED BY UNRESPONSIVE ELECTRONICS.",

AFTER ATTEMPTING TO TURN ON, ACCELERATOR PEDAL WILL HAVE .5-1 SECOND DELAY WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM STOP/IDLE CAUSING NEAR COLLISIONS.    SINCE PURCHASE, THERE HAVE BEEN 10-15 EPISODES WHERE I ATTEMPT TO TURN ON ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WHILE ON THE FREEWAY BUT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT ENGAGE. I ONLY GET 3 BEEPS AND AN \"ACC OFF\" INDICATION ON THE DASH. ONCE THIS HAPPENS, FOR THE REST OF THAT DRIVE, THERE IS A  PEDAL DEAD ZONE/SEVERE ACCELERATION DELAY WHEN STARTING FROM A STOP. THIS DELAY IN ACCELERATION HAS CAUSED SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WHEN PULLING OUT WITH OBSTRUCTED VIEWS AS I PRESS THE GAS PEDAL BUT GET NO RESPONSE FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE 1 SECOND WHILE ANOTHER CAR COMES INTO VIEW AND IS FAST APPROACHING.    ONCE THE INITIAL ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL FAILURE OCCURS, ACC AND TRADITIONAL CRUISE CONTROL WILL BOTH FAIL TO START ACROSS MULTIPLE DRIVES AND ENGINE STARTS. THE SEVERE PEDAL DELAY WILL RETURN ACROSS ENGINE STARTS AS SOON AS THE ACC BUTTON IS PRESSED. THE ONLY WAY TO RECOVER THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ACC AND NORMAL CRUISE CONTROL ONCE IN THIS STATE IS TO REMOVE POWER FROM THE BATTERY AND WAIT A MINUTE, THEN POWER ON THE ENGINE AND LET SYSTEMS RESTART.    CAR HAS BEEN TO DEALERS CLOSE TO 10 TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE. IN CONSULTATION WITH HONDA TECHLINE THE FOLLOWING PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BUT PROBLEM CONTINUES AT RANDOM INTERVALS: FORWARD LOOKING CAMERA, FORWARD RADAR SENSOR, MAIN INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, PEDAL SENSOR, WINDSHIELD, ALTERNATOR, BATTERY.    APPEARS TO BE SOME KIND OF SOFTWARE BUG IN ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM THAT CAUSES SYSTEM TO CRASH AND NOT WORK AGAIN UNTIL ENGINE COMPUTER RESET.

WITH THE PANDEMIC I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING A LOT, BUT I NOTICED IN SEPTEMBER 2020 THAT MY AC WAS NOT WORKING AGAIN.  I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER, AND NOW THEY SAY IT IS THE CONDENSER THAT IS BROKEN.  HOWEVER, THE SB-19-091 DOES NOT APPLY TO HATCHBACKS.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AS IT'S CLEAR EVEN FROM A CURSORY SEARCH THAT HATCHBACKS ARE ALSO IMPACTED.  THEY OFFERED ANOTHER \"GOODWILL\" FIX THAT IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FIRST ONE.  WHEN I CALLED CORPORATE THEY INITIALLY REFUSED TO FORWARD MY CASE.

I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE USED OIL FULFILLED 4 BOTTLES, WHICH WAS 10% MORE THAN WHAT I ADDED 3 MONTHS BEFORE. THIS WAS THE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING WENT INTO THE MOTOR OIL, WHICH I BELIEVED WAS GASOLINE, BECAUSE THE USED OIL HAD A GASOLINE SMELL.

THE RADIO TURNED OFF, THE SCREEN WENT BLACK, THE COMPUTER DASHBOARD FLASHED UNTIL FINALLY THE 'H' HONDA LOGO APPEARED ON THE RADIO SCREEN RESETTING ITSELF. SCARING ME TO BELIEVE THE CAR WAS SHUTTING DOWN OR ABOUT TO MALFUNCTION WHILE I WAS DRIVING! THREE MONTHS LATER THE RADIO, SATELLITE, SIDE MIRROR CAMERA, REAR BACKUP CAMERA EVERY THING ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPUTER BRAIN OF THIS CAR COMPLETELY WENT OUT! NOTHING CAN BE RESET THROUGH THE RADIO AS IT'S JUST STUCK. HONDA DEALERSHIP HAS NO EXPLANATION OTHER REPLACEMENT FOR SAFETY! DEALERSHIP REACHED OUT TO HONDA FOR ASSISTANCE AS I'VE EXCEEDED 36,000 MILE COMPLEMENTARY WARRANTY. HONDA ACTUALLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MALFUNCTION AT FIRST, STATING THEY WOULD PAY/COVER MAJORITY OF COST LEAVING BALACE OF $300. I FOUND THIS TO BE CRAZY, AS THIS ELECTICAL MALFUNCTION WAS NO FAULT OF MY OWN & SHOULD  INITIATE RECALL! AS I NOW HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF ALL SYSTEM WARNING LIGHTS ARE ERROR OR ACTUAL SAFETY WARNINGS! I HAVE NO REAR CAMERA OR SIDE MIRROR CAMERA DUE TO THIS RADIO/COMPUTER MALFUNCTION! THIS IS A DANGER DRIVING THIS CAR SO I CONTACTED HONDA AND EXPLAINED I WAS WILLING TO PAY THE $300 FOR REPLACEMENT. ONLY TO BE TOLD THEIR OFFER TO PAY/COVER MALFUNCTION ERRORS WAS NO LONGER ON THE TABLE, GIVING NO REASON WHY OFFER WAS REVOKED! THE CLAIMS ADJUSTER AND HER MANAGER THEN VERY RUDELY & DISRESPECTFULLY HUNG UP THE PHONE! I FEEL UNSAFE EVERYTIME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THIS CAR! PLEASE AID IN ESTABLISHING A RECALL",

NOT ONLY WAS I DRIVING ON THE SAME LANE AS ANY OTHER CAR, BUT CARS THAT WERE IN FRONT OF ME & BEHIND ME DROVE BY JUST FINE.

CAR IS AN EX AND HAS PREVIOUSLY TEST DRIVEN A 2017 CIVIC HATCHBACK SPORT THE DAY BEFORE . DROVE OFF WITH MY MEW CAR THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME WITH 450MILES. RIGHT AFTER I LEFT DEALERSHIP WITH MY BRAND NEW CAR AND WAS DRIVING HOME FOR FIRST TIME GOT ABOUT 6 MILES FROM DEALERSHIP AND DASHBOARD LIGHTS WITH DIGITAL  SPEEDOMETER DISPLAYED FLASHED  AND WENT DEAD (COMPLETELY BLANK A.K.A. BLACK SCREEN OF EARTH). I WAS DRIVING APPROX. 30-35 MPH . DROVE ANOTHER'S  ANOTHER MILE (APPROX) WITH NO DIGITAL SPEED DISPLAY AT ALL- COMPLETELY BLACK INSTRUMENT CLUSTER (MAIN DISPLAY WHICH NORMALLY SHOWS DIGITAL MILES PER HOUR, TEMP GAUGE, ETC) AND TURNED ON RIGHT HAND SIGNAL TO MAKE RIGHT TURN AND ABOUT FIVE SECONDS LATER  RIGHT SIDE CAMERA TURNED ON MEDIA DISPLAY TO RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY DIGITAL DASHBOARD SPEEDOMETER BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED BACK ON. EVERYTHING ON THE CAR IS COMPUTER CONTROLLED. THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS. NOT SURE HOW F CAR HAS A BAD CPU OR ECU. CALLED DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY AS I HAS JUST DRIVEN AWAY 15 MINUTES BEFORE AND THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL. I AM VERY CONCERNED.",
