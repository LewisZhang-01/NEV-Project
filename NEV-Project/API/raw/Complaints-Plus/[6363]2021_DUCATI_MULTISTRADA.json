The systems have been approved, and are being used in many European countries without incident as the data shows. I have been informed by my US dealer that the US Department of Transportation has not approved the use these potentially life saving systems for my motorcycle. The systems were made active for the media to test and evaluate on US highways without incident.   While this may not technically be a complaint against the manufacturer (Ducati), it is more of a question/complaint as to why the DOT has not approved these safety systems that would make me a safer driver and potentially save my life.  I am sure there are good reasons - please help me understand.",
