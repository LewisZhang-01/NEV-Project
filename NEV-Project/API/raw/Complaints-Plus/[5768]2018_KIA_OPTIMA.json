Local KIA Service Dept was informed & could neither confirm or deny its faulty behavior for it did not present itself during time of service. They said, wiring looked fine but did no further testing. To be honest they showed no interest into seeing any real importance for my concern for them to feel any further investigation was warranted. Its happened again twice since that service visit be it last incident Aug 7th. My concern is.... if there is faulty wiring or sensor signals being crossed somewhere, whats to say there is a passenger or no passenger in that seat, to ensure the correct signal is getting to the passenger side air bags of when to correctly deploy if an accident should happen with passenger in seat?  This situ is only recent starting about a year a go. So something has changed from   being fine for 2 yrs up to the last year that's now showing some kind of seat belt / sensor failure. I'm unfamiliar with how that wiring system works & linked within it for me know what other things I might need to pay more attn to, looking for other signs that could be saying is direct cause to the prob.

THIS CAUSES AN ADVERSE EFFECT.    THINK OF IT THIS WAY, THE BEAM HAS A DEFAULT SETTING TO WHERE IT POINTS TO WHEN THERE IS NO WEIGHT ADDED TO THE CAR. WHEN TWO PASSENGERS SIT IN THE CAR, THE BEAM SHOULD NOT POINT LOWER, INSTEAD IT SHOULD AUTO-LEVEL ITSELF TO A HIGHER POSITION TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOW LOWER WHEN WEIGHT IS ADDED TO THE VEHICLE.     I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE HEADLIGHTS BY DEFAULT ARE POINTED A BIT LOW, I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP (CONCORD KIA IN CONCORD, CA) TO HAVE THEM RE-ADJUSTED. ALAS, NO BETTER RESULT WAS ACHIEVED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE AUTO-LEVELING.

HOWEVER, I ENCOURAGE THE NHSTA TO RE-CONDUCT A THOROUGH TEST UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:    SEAT TWO PEOPLE IN THE FRONT WHO WEIGH AT LEAST 200 LBS. FIRST SEAT ONE PERSON, NOTICE THE BEAM PATTERN AGAINST A WALL ABOUT 50 FT. AWAY, THEN SEAT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE VEHICLE AND NOTICE HOW THE BEAM PATTERN IS LOWERED.

I HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT PICK UP SPEED. SO I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHO INFORMED ME THAT WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE IN JANUARY THAT THEY HAS PLACE A SAFTEY FEATURE ON MY CAR TO KEEP THE ENGINE FROM BLOWING UP. ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THERE IS POSSIBLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE, HOWEVER, THEY ARE STARTING OUT BY CHANGING THE WIRING FIRST. I CAN NOT EXPLAIN HOW DIFFERENT THIS DRIVES SINCE THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. IT IS THE WORST DRIVE. THE CAR IS VERY LOUD IT DOES NOT PICK UP SPEED WHEN IT SHOULD AND IT DOES NOT SLOW DOWN AS FAST AS IT USE TO. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS CAR AND SEEMINGLY EVERY TIME I TAKE IT IN FOR REPAIRS, THE CAR GETS WORST. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A NEW/USED KIA AGAIN.",

WHEN I FINISHED GETTING GAS, I TRIED TO OPEN THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR AND IT WAS LOCKED. ALL DOORS WERE LOCKED. I WAS 20 MILES FROM HOME FORTUNATELY SOMEONE WAS AT HOME TO BRING A SPARE KEY FOR ME TO OPEN THE TRUNK, PUSH THE REAR PASSENGER SEATS DOWN AND CLIMB THRU TO THE FRONT TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF AND UNLOCK THE DOOR.  THE SAME SCENARIO OCCURED THIS PAST WEEK WHEN I HAD GONE OUTSIDE TO WARM UP MY CAR BY TURNING ON THE DEFROST FOR THE FRONT AND BACK WINDOWS. ONCE AGAIN, THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AND I CLOSED THE DOORS.  ONCE THE CAR WAS WARM, I TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR AND IT WAS LOCKED.  I HAD TO GO IN THE HOUSE TO GET THE OTHER SET OF KEYS, OPEN THE TRUNK PUSH THE BACK SEATS DOWN AND CLIMB THRU THE TO THE FRONT, TURN OFF THE IGNITION AND UNLOCK THE DOOR.  THIS LAST OCCURENCE WAS ONCE AGAIN AT A GAS STATION, THIS TIME IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT, IT WAS 20 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND HAD TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE FROM MY HOUSE BRING THE SPARE KEYS.
