        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING A U-HAUL 6X12 TRAILER EASTBOUND ON I-90, AND EXITED ON TO EXIT 110 (?) ON TO I-82.  ON THE I-90 OVERPASS I WAS TRAVELING ~ 35 MPG AND STRUCK A SIGNIFICANT BUMP FROM A PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.  THE BUMP CAUSED THE TRAILER TO DETACH FROM MY VEHICLE, A F150 CREW CAB.  THE TRAILER REMAINED ATTACHED VIA THE SAFETY CHAINS, AND CAREENED LEFT AND RIGHT AS MY VEHICLE EVENTUALLY (AFTER ~30 SECONDS) CAME TO A HALT ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE TRAILER, THE KNOB THAT LOCKS THE TRAILER TO THE HITCH BALL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DEFORMED.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE TRAILER IS EQUIPPED WITH A HYDRAULIC EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEM; HOWEVER, THE BRAKE LEVER THAT ACTUATES THE EMERGENCY BRAKING MECHANISM SHEARED COMPLETELY OFF ITS TWO ATTACHMENT BOLTS.  THEREFORE, NO BRAKING OCCURRED, AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO NOT SUFFER SERIOUS INJURY, DEATH, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE.  THE FAILURE OF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS CATASTROPHIC.",
