        "summary": "ON NOV 10 I GAVE $4500 TO A BUDDY PAIN IN ONTARIO OR FOR A DEPOSIT FOR A CUSTOM BUILT 14K GVW DUMP TRAILER. HIS BUSINESS IS CALLED IRON WORKS. HE TOLD ME THEY ARE VERY HEAVY DUTY LIKE BIG TEX TRAILERS. HE TOLD ME HE HAS BEEN BUILDING TRAILERS FOR 20 YEARS NOW. AFTER TELLING HIM WHAT I WANTED MY TRAILER TO BE LIKE, HE SAID IT SHOULD TAKE HIM ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO BUILD. I HAVE THE E-MAIL HE SENT ME REGARDING THE SPEC PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED: A 7X14FT. DUMP TRAILER WITH 48\" SIDES,14K GVW, SCISSOR LIFT SYSTEM, A VERY PROFESSIONAL PAINT JOB, SWINGING DOORS THAT PIN OUT OF THE WAY. HE TOLD ME I WILL HAVE TWO OPTIONS TO OPEN AFTER I GET THE TRAILER. I TOLD HIM I HAUL EQUIPMENT, LOGS, AND HEAVY WOOD CHIPS UP TO 7K LBS.   I PAID $5900 FOR THE TRAILER $4500 DOWN AND $1400 FOR PICK UP DAY. I CALLED HIM AROUND CHRISTMAS AND ASKED WHERE IS THE TRAILER? HE TOLD ME EVERY THING IN THE BOOK . EVERY WEEK HE HAD AN EXCUSE HE FIRED HIS EMPLOYEES TO BAD RIMS AXELS I HEARD IT ALL. HE GAVE ME ABOUT 10 DIFFERENT DATES THE TRAILER WOULD BE DONE BUT STILL NOT DONE.   JUST YESTERDAY I DROVE TO HIS HOME TO PICK UP THE TRAILER. WHEN I ARRIVED THE TRAILER DUMP WAS UP IN THE AIR SO I COULD SEE THE FRAME. THIS WAS NOT A HEAVY DUTY TRAILER IT LOOKED LIKE A LAWN MOWER TRAILER ON STEROIDS. THE TRAILER WAS VERY FLIMSY AND WEAK. I TOLD HIM THIS WAS NOT GOING TO WORK THE PAINT WAS VERY BAD BEAR METAL SPOTS AND PATCHES OF PRIMER SHOWING. HE GAVE ME PAPER WORK HE GENERATED FOR DMV WITH A 14 K GVW AND NO WAY IS THAT THE TRUTH. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. VERY UNSAFE TRAILER.  *TR",
