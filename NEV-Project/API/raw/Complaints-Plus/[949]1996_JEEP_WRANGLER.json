THIS VEHICLE, PURCHASED NEW BY ME, WITH ALL ORIGINAL STOCK EQUIPMENT, TO INCLUDE TIRES WITH 6900 (SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED) MILES EXPERIENCED A SEVERE FRONT-END WOBBLE THAT NEARLY CAUSED A CAR BEHIND ME (AND SEVERAL OTHERS BEHIND IT) TO PILE-UP AS I HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER. THIS VEHICLE IS ONLY USED FOR WEEKEND DRIVING AROUND TOWN AND IS GARAGED. THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN TOWED NOR HAS IT EVER BEEN IN 4-WHEEL DRIVE. I PREVIOUSLY TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP IN VACAVILLE, CA TWO YEARS PRIOR FOR THE SAME PROBLEM BUT WAS TOLD NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND. I DOUBT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS ACTUALLY \"TESTED\" ON THE ROAD. TO CLARIFY, I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY TWICE. INCREDIBLY, THIS TIME (JULY 26, 2013) CHRYSLER JEEP VACAVILLE TOLD THAT STEERING STABILIZER AND RIGHT-SIDE BUSHING WAS \"WORN\" - $853.94 LATER, PROBLEM IS FIXED. I HAVE VEHICLE PARTS THAT WERE REPLACED FOR YOUR EXAMINATION IF NECESSARY. THANK YOU!!  *TR",

WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE RATTLING NOISE. WELL, LAST WEEK MY CAR HAD TWO EPISODES OF  SHUDDERING WHILE AT A COMPLETE STOP. THIS WEEK, MY  ENGINE CCHECK  LIGHT HAS BEEN ON FOR AT LEAST TWO DAYS. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS COULD VERY MUCH BE DUE TO THE CONVERTER BY A SERVICE PERSON. MY CAR WAS ALREADY AT A CRITICALSTAGE OF NEEDING THE REPLACEMENT.
