FRONT AND REAR WINDOW DEFROSTERS TYPICALLY COME ON WHEN THE VEHICLE IS REMOTE STARTED IN THE WINTER MONTHS.  REAR WINDOW OF TRUCK HAS THREE SEPARATE PANES, THE TWO OUTER PANES ARE STATIONARY AND THE MIDDLE SLIDES OPENS VIA A SWITCH IN THE OVERHEAD CONSOLE.  ALL WINDOWS IN VEHICLE WERE CLOSED.    I WAS STANDING BESIDE THE VEHICLE WHEN THERE WAS A LOUD CRACKING SOUND AND SMALL PIECES OF THE REAR WINDOW PANE BEHIND THE DRIVER FELL TO THE GROUND.  THE WINDOW CONTINUED TO MAKE A CRACKING SOUNDS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE INITIAL SOUND.  THERE IS A SLIGHT SMELL OF ELECTRICAL WIRE BURNING INSIDE THE VEHICLE VERY CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM LEFT SIDE OF THE DAMAGED PANE OF GLASS.    DESPITE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION, GM CLAIMS THAT THE VIN OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.

THE PROBLEM ALSO SEEMS TO BE MORE COMMON IN CANADA WHERE A FULL RECALL IS IN EFFECT.  AT THIS POINT, HOWEVER, GM CUSTOMER CARE (CASE # 9-6442774509) SAYS THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND REFERRED ME BACK TO DEALER...WHO I WILL ASSUME WILL REFER ME BACK TO CUST CARE AGAIN.  I'M WAITING ON THEIR RESPONSE.  MAKES NO SENSE THAT THEY WILL REIMBURSE ONLY FOR VEHICLES IN CERTAIN STATES.  I'M IN THE SAME COLD CLIMATE AS MICHIGAN AND MANY OF THE OTHER IMPACTED STATES.

AFTER GETTING THE TRUCK TOWED TO MY HOUSE, AND THEN TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY, THE DEALERSHIP SPENT 2 DAYS DIAGNOSING THE TRANSMISSION BEFORE DETERMINING THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REMOVED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. AFTER THEY REMOVED THE TRANSMISSION, THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE GEARS AND CLUTCH PACKS FOR GEARS 2 THROUGH 6 HAD BLOWN APART. THIS IS OF COURSE WAS ABSURD DUE TO THE AGE OF THE VEHICLE, THE MILEAGE AND THE FACT THAT I'VE NEVER TOWED ANYTHING WITH THE TRUCK OR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF NORMAL EVERYDAY DRIVING. FORTUNATELY, IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY SO THE DEALER PROCEEDED TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION. FAST FORWARD TO 60,000 MILES LATER AND OF COURSE THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS HAVE RETURNED.
