THE NOTIFICATIONS ON MY DASH WERE 'ENG PWR REDUCED' AND 'SERVICE ESC'. AFTER LOOKING ONLINE FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES, IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT ENGINE POWER REDUCED AND SERVICE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM WITH CHEVY MALIBU'S FROM OLDER MODELS TO NEWER 2016-2018 MODELS). NOT ONLY IS IT COMMON, BUT MOST PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUE I DID, END UP SPENDING THOUSANDS TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. REPAIRS RANGE FROM CHANGING THE THROTTLE BODY TO SENSORS TO BATTERY CABLES & TERMINALS. A FEW GET LUCKY BUT FOR THE MAJORITY OF MALIBU OWNERS, THE PROBLEM RETURNS WITHIN DAYS OR IF THEY'RE LUCKY, THEY GET A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE THE ERROR CODES COME BACK. ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS SEARCH THE FORUMS OF CARGURUS.COM OR YOUTUBE FOR VIDEOS TO FIND THE COUNTLESS POSTS OF CHEVY MALIBU OWNERS ALL EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. I PERSONALLY READ OF MANY ACCOUNTS WHERE OWNERS WERE ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAVE THE ENGINE POWER REDUCED. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AND EVENTUALLY SOMEONE OR MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET KILLED WHEN THEY LOSE POWER AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. CHEVY IS UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AND ARE CHOOWING TO TURN A BLIND EYE INSTEAD OF ISSUING A RECALL. WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR GM TO ADMIT THERE'S A PROBLEM? MULTIPLE DEATHS? MECHANICS, EVEN THOSE THAT WORK FOR GM KNOW THERE'S AN ISSUE BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT PERMANENTLY. I'M SURE I'M NOT ALONE WHEN I SAY I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THOUSANDS FOR GUESS WORK. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EVEN CONSIDER IT BECAUSE GM KNOWS THERE'S AN ISSUE AND AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BEFORE PEOPLE GET KILLED, AN INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED & A RECALL ISSUED!",

HOWEVER THE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS, THE CAMSHAFT POSITION ACTUATORS, THE ALTENATOR AND THE BATTERY HAVE ALL BEEN REPLACED.   THE ISSUE HAS UPSET ME DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS IN LINE WITH 2 KNOWN CONCERNS AND REPORTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED BY CHEVY OR GM.     1) DISCUSSION OF BATTERY CABLES BEING THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM (UNANSWERED)  2) GM IGNITION SWITCH RECALL FEB 2014 (WHICH SEEMS TO BE VERY IN LINE WITH THIS ISSUE).    I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP AND OFCOURSE PAID FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TO BE TOLD \"COULD NOT DUPLICATE\".     IT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME AND HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THESE SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT COULD BE THE SOURCE.     I WAS ABLE TO FIND FORUMS AND REPORTS ON BOTH THE BATTERY CABLES AND THE IGNITION SWITCH FAILURES.     THE IGNITION SWITCH FAILURE WERE SUPPOSEDLY ONLY ISSUES FOR SPECIFIC VEHICLES HOWEVER THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN THE RECORDED MALIBU COMMUNITY ARE TOTALLY IN LINE WITH THE SAME FROM THAT RECALL.   WE NOW ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE IGNITION STRUGGLING TO TURNOVER.

OUT OF WARRANTY, I KNEW IT HAD TO BE AC CONDENSING LINE RELATED. I WENT TO THE DEALER (WEBER CHEVROLET IN CREVE COEUR MO), WHERE PURCHASED NEW, TO GET A DIAGRAM OF WHERE THE AC LINES RUN. THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST ME. I WENT TO AN AC AUTO REPAIR PERSON WHO FOUND A FACTORY PLUG IN THE AC DRAIN HOSE THAT EXITS THE COWL INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. HE REMOVED THE PLUG AND WATER OF COURSE CAME OUT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT BUT THE WATER KEPT LEAKING INTO THE CARPET. I REMOVED THE FRONT CARPET AND FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AFTER VISITING A POST ON A CHEVYMALIBU FORUM. IT IS LEAKING THROUGH A 3OR 4SPONGE RUBBER SEAL ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HOCKEY PUCK, THAT APPARENTLY SURROUNDS THE BLOWER HOUSING TUBE THAT ENCASES THE CONDENSATION LINE THAT EXTENDS THOUGH THE COWL. I HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH A SERVICE SUPERVISOR AT WEBER. I JUST RECEIVED A FORUM REPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING TSB INFORMATION: MOISTURE IN CABIN: TSB 09-01-37-002A (A/C - FRONT/REAR PASSENGER CARPET WET). I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A VIABLE REPAIR PROCEDURE BECAUSE I CANNOT ACCESS THE TSB BULLETIN.",

MANY PEOPLE HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MAKING REPAIRS THAT MECHANICS AND DEALERSHIPS SAY WILL CORRECT THE ISSUE YET HAVE STATED THE ISSUE STILL OCCURS IN THEIR VEHICLES. I REFUSE TO THROW MONEY INTO REPAIRS IF THERE ISN'T A KNOWN SOURCE AS I HAVE ALREADY MADE ONE REPAIR THAT DIS NOT FIX MY VEHICLES PROBLEM! WITH THE NUMBER OF CHEVY VEHICLES EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS, WHY ISN'T THIS A RECALL???  *TR",

INTERMITTENTLY THE VEHICLE WILL TURN EVERYTHING ON, BUT NOT TURN OVER OR START THE ENGINE.  THE BATTERY IS NEW AND THIS ONLY HAPPENS SPORADICALLY.  ALSO, WITH THE SAME INTERMITTENT THE KEY BECOMES STUCK IN THE IGNITION / KEY MECHANISM ON THE STEERING COLUMN AND IT WILL NOT COME OUT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT WIGGLING AND FORCEFUL PULLING.

THE DEALER SAID THERE ISN'T A RECALL FOR THESE ISSUES BUT I AM UNDER A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING RECALL! THEY DO NOT HAVE  THE PARTS BUT I CAN KEEP CALLING AND CHECKING . I THEN CALLED GM BACK SPOKE TO [XXX] WHO ADVISED THERE ISN'T A RECALL FOR THE BRAKE LIGHT YET . IT IS UPCOMING SOON THEY ARE IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THIS . NO  TIME FRAME WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. I ASKED WHAT DO I DO IN THE MEANTIME WITH THIS UNSAFE CAR. SHE SAID I CAN GET IT FIXED AT MY EXPENSE. I QUESTIONED IF I WOULD BE REIMBURSED ONCE THEY ISSUE THE RECALL. SHE ANSWERED NO PROMISE THEY WILL.  LATER THAT DAY THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER CALLED SAYING GM TOLD HIM TO CALL ME! WE COULD MAKE AN APPT TO CHECK MY CAR, PAY OUT  OF POCKET , KEEP RECEIPT , AND IF THE RECALL INCLUDES MY PARTS, I WILL BE  REIMBURSED OR I CAN TRY TO HOLD OUT FOR RECALL. I AM BEYOND FRUSTRATED. I'M UNDER AN ACTIVE RECALL BUT NO PART TO FIX IT AND THIS OTHER IN BEGINNING STAGES. THIS LIGHT  ISSUE HAPPENED TO ME IN OCTOBER 2013. I BOUGHT A NEW BRAKE SWITCH, HAD IT REPLACED BY A CERTIFIED MECHANIC. NOW MONTHS LATER I HAVE THE SAME BRAKE LIGHT  ISSUE BUT ALSO MY CRUISE CONTROL, ESC WARNING AND TRACTION CONTROL. THE BEST PART WHEN I ASKED [XXX] AT GM WHAT IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE YOU ARE DRAGGING  THIS OUT. SHE REPLIED YOU  SHOULD CALL US BACK AFTER YOUR ACCIDENT.

HTTP://WWW.GMINSIDENEWS.COM/FORUMS/F31/STEERING-COLUMN-MODULE-08-MALIBU-71371/INDEX2.HTML  HTTP://WWW.BATAUTO.COM/FORUMS/INDEX.PHP?TOPIC=11400.0    AND SOME VIDEO:  HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=ZR62GJNH1GM  HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=EOH5MQ4X4CG    AND THESE MODELS WERE RECALLED IN CANADA FOR A POWER STEERING ISSUE:  HTTP://WWW.AUTOBLOG.COM/2012/10/03/GM-RECALLING-67K-CHEVY-MALIBU-PONTIAC-G6-AND-SATURN-AURA-MODELS/    AFTER DOING THIS RESEARCH, WE RECENTLY JUST TOOK OUR MALIBU TO OUR NEAREST CHEVY DEALER, DIAMOND CHEVY IN AUBURN, MA.  THEY TOLD US THAT IT WAS NOT UNDER ANY KIND OF WARRANTY.  AFTER DOING DIAGNOSTICS, THEY TOLD US IT WAS INDEED THE POWER STEERING MOTOR CONTROL MODULE, WHICH IS THE SAME THING THAT THE ABOVE MENTIONED OWNERS WERE EXPERIENCING.  WE WERE QUOTED AT $956 FOR PARTS AND LABOR TO REPAIR THIS.    WE FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND DEFECT OF THE 2008 CHEVY MALIBU.  US, AND IT APPEARS MANY OTHER DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM, AND IT WAS DEEMED SERIOUS ENOUGH IN CANADA TO RECALL.  WHILE YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON SAFETY, WE FEEL THAT IT IS AN EXTREME INJUSTICE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY $900 + OUT OF POCKET FOR A PROBLEM THAT A) EFFECTS OUR SAFETY SO EXTREMELY AND B) IS NOT CONSIDERED NORMAL \"WEAR AND TEAR\".  I BEG YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER A RECALL ON THIS MODEL MALIBU.  *TR",

I HAVE CALLED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WILL WORK WITH ME AND THE DEALERSHIP TO GET THIS FIXED. BEFORE I GO TO THE DEALERSHIP I WANT TO HAVE ALL MY DOCUMENTATION THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS A SPECIAL POLICY ISSUE AND NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR OUT OF MY OWN WALLET.

ON A DAILY BASIS THE POWER STEERING BECOMES ERRATIC AND FAILS TO REACT PROPERLY UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS, USUALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  WHILE STOPPED, THE STEERING WHEEL WILL TURN LEFT AND RIGHT ON ITS OWN.  WHEN THIS OCCURS AT HIGHWAY SPEED CONTROL OF THE CAR IS DANGEROUS.  TWO HANDS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP CAR IN LANE AND NOT CROSS THE LINE INTO OTHER VEHICLES.  PROBLEM BEGAN WHEN MILEAGE HIT 45,000 MILES.  OCCASIONALLY, A CHIME WILL OCCUR AND INDICATE POWER STEERING IN THE DISPLAY BUT BY THE TIME THE CHIME OCCURS THE STEERING PROBLEM IS GONE.  THIS ISSUE IS CONSISTENT AND INTERMITTENT ON A DAILY BASIS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM FOR CHEVY MALIBU AND HAVE FOUND THAT THOUSANDS OF MALIBU OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM CAUSED BY IMPROPER ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  THIS STEERING PROBLEM IS A FAILURE OF A COMPONENT IN THE STEERING ASSEMBLY THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART!!!  AS A PERCENTAGE OF MALIBUS ON THE ROAD THAT HAVE THIS PROBLEM I WOULD VENTURE THAT IT IS VERY HIGH AND THE NUMBER IS INCREASING.  THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST POWER STEERING IN THE I4 MALIBU'S IS A ROAD HANDLING NIGHTMARE AND GM HAS NO INTEREST IN FIXING THIS PROBLEM.  I WOULD EXPECT A SERIOUS PROBLEM LIKE THIS TO BE MADE A RECALL ISSUE BEFORE THERE IS A FATALITY AND THEN GM AND OBAMA MOTORS WILL BE SUED FOR RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.   *KB",

ALSO THEY SAID IT RUNS ABOUT 800.00 TO FIX THEN THERE ARE REPORTS OF IT GOING RIGHT BACK TO NOT WORKING, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE I DON'T HAVE 800.00, I SPENT 24,000 ON THIS VEHICLE I SHOULD HAVE TO TURN MY VEHICLE OFF TO JUST POSTPONE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  *TR",

        "summary": "I LEASED A NEW 2008 CHEVY MALIBU THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING. GREAT CAR, LOVED IT. THEN ON JAN 14TH WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY (IN THE FAST LANE)  MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHED ON A COUPLE OF TIMES. CONCERNED I DECIDED MAYBE I SHOULD PULL OFF THE ROAD. LUCKILY THERE WAS AN OFF RAMP CLOSE. AS I PROCEEDED TO THE OFF RAMP I REALIZED THAT THE ENGINE HAD SHUT DOWN SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT COAST AS FAR OUT OF THE WAY AS POSSIBLE AND PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE BEEN DRIVING A RENTAL CAR, STILL MAKING MY CAR PAYMENT, AND HAVE NO IDEA WHEN I WILL BE GETTING MY REPLACEMENT CAR. THE DEALERSHIP/GM ARE GOING COMPLETELY THROUGH THE CAR THAT BLEW UP AND HAVE AGREED THEY WILL GET ME A NEW CAR, THAT IS MY ONLY OPTION SINCE THEY WON'T REFUND MY MONEY. THE BAD THING IS I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THEY WILL GET MY REPLACEMENT.  I AM STILL MAKING CAR PAYMENTS FOR A NEW CAR THAT I DO NOT HAVE. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN CHEVY AND PROBABLY WON'T BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR A LONG TIME. ONCE THIS LEASE IT UP I AM DONE. WE HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL CARS FROM THIS DEALERSHIP, COURTESY. THIS INCIDENT HAS SHOWN ME HOW TERRIBLE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS. THEY NEVER CALL ME, I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED TO REIMBURSE MY CAR PAYMENTS.  *TR",
