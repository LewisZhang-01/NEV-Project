IT STUCK AGAIN IN 2006 AND HAS BEEN THAT WAY TO THIS DAY. MY PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR IS NOW STUCK AS OF JULY 10 2010. I CANNOT AFFORD REPAIRS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THE CAR JUST CUT OFF WHILE DRIVING FRIDAY, JULY 16, 2010 AND HOPEFULLY I CAN AFFORD THE REPAIRS TO GET IT WORKING AGAIN. I MUST CLIMB OVER THE SEAT TO THE BACK AND GO OUT OF THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR. THE DRIVER SIDE REAR DOOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF THE LATCH (THEY CONTINUE TO BREAK) AND I HAVE REPLACED ALL OF THEM AT ONE POINT. THEY ARE $25.00 AT THE JAY MARK HYUNDAI. THEY ARE LISTED BELOW:  DRIVER SIDE WINDOW IS BROKEN. I WENT DOWN AND NEVER CAME UP AGAIN. I COULD NOT AFFORD REPAIRS THEN AND ASKED THE MECHANIC TO PUSH IT UP AND PUT A SCREW SO THAT IT WOULD NOT COME DOWN AGAIN. THE LATCH HAS BROKEN AND BEEN REPLACED TWICE. THE THIRD TIME I WAS NOT GOING TO BUY ANOTHER LATCH. THE DOOR IS STUCK AND WILL NOT OPEN.   THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW WILL NOT GO DOWN COMPLETELY. THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT DOOR WILL NOT OPEN IT IS ALSO STUCK AND HAS BEEN FOR YEARS. I HAD IT REPAIRED AND ABOUT A YEAR LATER IT WOULD NO OPEN AGAIN.  THE REAR DRIVER WINDOW WILL NOT GO UP AND STAY UP. IT WILL COME DOWN INCH BY INCH UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT AND NOW I CANNOT GET IT TO GO UP AGAIN. THE LATCH IS ALSO BROKEN ON THAT DOOR AS WELL AND I HAD THAT LATCH REPLACED BUT ONLY ONCE.     THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM CAUGHT FIRE.THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS IN DISREPAIR AGAIN BECAUSE THE TAIL LIGHTS WILL WORK FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AT A TIME AND THEN THEY ARE OUT AGAIN OR IT WILL SHORT OUT THE BULBS AND AT NIGHT I MUST SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE BRAKES WHILE DRIVING TO HAVE THE TAIL LIGHTS AND AVOID A TICKET.  BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THEY CAR WILL NOT PASS INSPECTION. THE SYSTEM IS NEVER READY. THE BATTERY WILL SHORT FROM TIME TO TIME AND I MUST REPLACE. *TR",
