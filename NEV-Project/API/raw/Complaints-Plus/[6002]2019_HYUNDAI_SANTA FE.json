Again it didn't register a code and I was told by the dealership no code,  no problem. Spoke with Hyundai customer relations and was told I have to take it back to the dealership for them to diagnose it, and the condition has to be reproduced for them to note the error but We have not had snow since that morning therefore the system error has not reappeared. The likelihood of being able to reproduce the circumstance during business hours and be able to get it to them to witness the situation is minuscule at best. If this safety feature is deactivated when something as simple as a snowflake blocks the sensor then it isn't really a safety feature.  The safety features contributed to my decision to purchase this vehicle (Nov 1st) but all I am told was the radar was blocked and therefore caused the deactivation,  but again how can something as simple as a snowflake cause this error and the manufacturer not address this as a safety concern.",

I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED A COUPLE OF TIMES BECAUSE THE CAR WOULDN'T GO INTO GEAR AND MOVE WITH THE GAS PEDAL PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SHIFT INTO GEARS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING TO A BRAND NEW CAR! LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MODELS THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH HYUNDAI. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY MY CAR BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN THE SHOP. THEY FIX IT AND IT WORKS FOR A WEEK OR SO AND THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG! I WAS TOLD IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN THEN THEY WILL CALL THE MAIN HEADQUARTERS. THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT ALREADY TO FIND OUT HOW TO FIX IT ONCE AND FOR ALL SO I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING BACK. I HOPE YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.",

        "summary": "I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AUGUST 1 AND DROVE IT HOME, 50 MILES, AT 75+ MPH.  IMMEDIATELY I NOTICED A HIGH VIBRATION IN THE RIDE AS WELL AS LOOKING IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR THE CARS BEHIND ME WERE BLURRY FROM THE VIBRATION UNTIL I PLACE A FINGER ON THE MIRROR.  I RETURNED TO THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY RELATING TO THE VIBRATION.  THEY BALANCED THE FRONT TIRES.  I RETURNED HOME AND THE VIBRATION WAS STILL THERE.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER 4 MORE TIMES WITH NO SOLUTION.  I HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED WITH A RENTAL FOR A FEW DAYS AND WAS TOLD THE SUV WAS READY.  I PICKED IT UP ON A SATURDAY AND ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO GO FOR A RIDE TO SEE IF THE VIBRATION WAS STILL THERE.  NO ONE WAS AVAILABLE SO I DROVE IT HOME AND THE VIBRATION WAS STILL THERE.   I RETURNED IT TO THE DEALER AND AN HYUNDIA ENGINEER TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE UP TO 70MPH WHICH WAS IN THE CITY AND NOT HIGHWAY DRIVING.  I HAD A CONFERENCE CALL WITH  THE GM AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINEER SAID ALL OF THE SUVS VIBRATED AND THIS ONE WAS MORE \"PRONOUNCED\" WHICH WAS NOT IN HIS REPORT TO HYUNDIA WHO I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT.  I BELIEVE THIS VIBRATION IS NOT IN THE WHEELS, ONE TIRE WAS REPLACED, BUT MECHANICALLY ELSEWHERE.  IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE 9/25/2018.  I BELIEVE THIS SUV TO BE UNSAFE AND THAT OTHER COMPONENTS WILL FAIL.  THIS IS MY 3RD SUV AND I'VE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE FIRST 2.  ANOTHER ENGINEER IS SCHEDULED TO INSPECT IT 10/23/2018.  I AM A HELICOPTER PILOT AND KNOW WHAT VIBRATIONS CAN DO TO MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS.",
