The failure can cause difficulties in turning the vehicle.    The failure can lead to catastrophic failure of the axels, leading to the wheels to lock up.   The problem is reoccurring in model years 2016-2019. Toyota is aware of the problem and has issued bulletins (see Toyota Technical Service Bulletin T-TCI-5185 Rev.1, dated 4/5/2019).  Yet, Toyota refuses to offer a cost free repair of the failure/damage.   The failure was inspected and confirmed by an authorized Toyota dealership on 2/9/2022.  The failure had no warning signs/indicators.   The failure began approximately 30-45 ago with a faint grinding sound coming from the drivetrain while driving.",

THEY SAID IT WAS A KNOWN DEFECT BUT NOT A RECALL AND THE DESIGN WAS CHANGED FOR THE 2019 MODEL, SO IT IS UNIQUE TO THE 2018 MODEL. TOYOTA GAVE THE DEALERSHIP 3 WAYS TO FIX THIS ISSUE. THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE IF THE 3 FIXES DID NOT WORK.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE IN A TOTAL OF 10 TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF OVER A YEAR. THEY TRIED ALL 3 OF THESE PLUS ANOTHER 5 WAYS TO TRY TO FIX; SOME DID NOT WORK, AND SOME WERE MERELY COSMETIC AND DID NOT HOLD DURING NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS. THE LAST 2 TIMES JIM HUDSON PAID A BODY SHOP TO FIX IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, WHICH IT HAS NOT.  WE ARE STUCK WITH A VEHICLE THAT HAS LOST VALUE DUE TO TOYOTA (DEFECT AS WELL AS HISTORY OF REPAIRS) AS WELL AS QUESTIONABLE SAFETY DUE TO THE BUMPER CONTINUOUSLY DETACHING..  ALL WE ASKED IS THAT THEY PURCHASE THE VEHICLE FROM US FOR WHAT WE OWE. WE FINANCED THROUGH TOYOTA. TOYOTA CORPORATE REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER AFTER REVIEWING FOR 2 MONTHS.
