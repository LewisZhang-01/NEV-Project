I kept getting recall notices from Ford, so I contacted them to let them know the airbags had been replaced. They insisted I never brought the car in, but I have the paperwork. Upon going over the details with Ford during the first phone call. Only one airbag had been replaced, and they gave the car back to me under the impression it was safe to drive. Last week was the third time I've contacted. Each time they say they will investigate the matter and never call back. I've lost confidence in this dealership and Ford for being unwilling to admit they dropped the ball and fix the problem. Their letters say they will come to you, but that's not happening either.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY COULDN'T FIND THE LEAK. I STARTED TO WET VACUUMING  THE WATER OUT.  THEN THE CAR STARTED TO SMELL LIKE MOLD. I FINALLY CALLED MY NEPHEW WHO WORKS FOR FORD IN ANOTHER CITY.  HE CLEANED OUT THE DRAIN IN FRONT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AND DRIED OUT THE CAR. WHY DIDN'T THE MECHANIC AT LANDMARK KNOW ABOUT THE DRAIN? AROUND THIS TIME THE CAR  STARTED TO LOCK AND UNLOCK ITSELF WHILE PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY.  CALLED DEALER NO HELP. CALLED NEPHEW HE SAID WIRING ISSUE.  THE LOCKING AND UNLOCKING STOPPED.  SINCE THEN THE LOCKS TRY TO RELOCK ANYTIME I ACCELERATED FROM A FULL STOP.   I HAVE FOUND MY WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN.  I NEVER LEAVE MY WINDOWS DOWN. I AM A BIG STICKLER WHEN IT COMES TO  LOCKING MY CAR UP AND I DON'T LEAVE MY WINDOWS DOWN. IT HAPPENED AGAIN THIS LAST WEEK. NEXT CAME THE TRUNK. IT WOULD UNLOCK WHILE I WAS DRIVING. FINALLY REMOVED THE FUSE TO MAKE IT STOP. THE NEXT FAIL WAS THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER. NOTHING WORKS RIGHT. SPORADICALLY THE SPEEDOMETER WORKS BUT CAN STOP ANY TIME.  LUCKILY THE ODOMETER WORKS SO I USE THE TRIP METER TO KNOW WHEN TO GET GAS.  RIGHT NOW MY CAR LIES DEAD IN THE DRIVEWAY.  THE CD CHANGER STARTED SHUFFLING CD'S WHEN THE CAR WAS RUNNING OR PARKED.  PROBLEM WAS IT HAD NOT BEEN TURNED ON.  I HAVE ON OCCASION SMELLED SMOKE IN THE CAR WHILE DRIVING.  FROM RESEARCHING THE INTERNET, EVIDENTLY THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHORTING OUT DUE TO WATER GETTING INTO THE FUSE BOX DUE TO THE DRAIN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. MY CAR ONLY HAS 107000 MILES ON IT.  FORD KNOWS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND HAS KNOW.  THEY NEED TO MAKE IT RIGHT. OH AND TO TOP IT OFF, I TOOK IT TO A FORD SPECIALIST AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR. $370 LATER MY CAR IS STILL DEAD.",

THE NUMBER OF THIS RECALL IS  15S21 AND FORD WOULD SEND ME A LETTER WHEN PARTS WERE AVAILABLE. IN FEBRUARY OF 2016 I STILL HAD NOT HEARD FROM FORD SO I CALLED MY DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. AT THE SAME TIME I EMAILED FORD AND THE REPLY WAS TO WAIT FOR PARTS TO BE AVAILABLE. FINALLY ON 5/25/16 I EMAILED FORD AGAIN TRYING TO FIND OUT IF PARTS WERE AVAILABLE AND I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD BE NOTIFIED IN THE \"VERY NEAR FUTURE\" ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF PARTS. AS OF TODAY 6/30/16 I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE PARTS BEING AVAILABLE. IT HAS BEEN SINCE MARCH 2015 THAT I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND WITH A POSSIBLE DEFECTIVE AIRBAG IN MY MUSTANG. APPARENTLY THE REPLACEMENT AIRBAG THEY PUT IN ON 3/25/15 MAY ALSO BE DEFECTIVE PER FORD. MY WIFE AND I DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE. I ACTUALLY ASKED FORD IF THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE TO DRIVE AND THEY DID NOT REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I LIVE IN AN AREA OF HIGH HEAT IN PHOENIX AND I AM WONDERING IF OUR LIVES ARE IN DANGER DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.

I HAD MY ALTERNATOR CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND AFTER THAT IS WHEN MY OTHER GAUGES QUIT WORKING. SINCE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALMOST EVERY ONE MADE DURING THAT YEAR, YOU WOULD BELIEVE THAT FORD WOULD NOT WANT TO TARNISH THEIR NAME BY NOT ISSUING A RECALL. I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED A FORD, BUT MY FAMILY HAS RECENTLY CHANGED TO DIFFERENT MAKES AND I WILL DEFINITELY CONSIDER CHANGING AFTER THIS. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF YOUR GAUGES ARE NOT WORKING, YOU COULD STALL IN TRAFFIC BY RUNNING OUT OF GAS, OVERHEATING, ENGINE LOCK UP, ETC. I NEED MY CAR SO I CAN MAKE A LIVING FOR MY FAMILY AND I DO LOVE MY CAR, BUT I AM CONSIDERING GETTING RID OF IT BECAUSE I AM AFRAID SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN WHILE I AM IN TRAFFIC. THIS DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE START HAVING ACCIDENTS OR DYING. WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT IS TODAY, MOST PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEIR CAR REPAIRED OR CHANGE CARS SO THEY ARE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE CHANCES. IF IT WAS YOUR FAMILY IN THE CAR AND SOMETHING HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC, WOULD A RECALL COME ANY FASTER? I HAVE NOTICED RECALLS IN THE NEWS HAPPENING FASTER WHEN SOMEONE DIES, BUT I WONDER HOW MANY COMPLAINTS WERE RECEIVED BEFORE THAT HAPPENED?

I'M NOT A BELIEVER THAT MECHANICAL THINGS FIX THEMSELVES    I'VE SEEN MULTIPLE ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET ABOUT SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH 2005-2006 MUSTANGS AND ALSO FORD RECALLS OF OTHER MAKES/MODELS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS REGARDING ACCELERATOR PEDALS AND AUTOMATIC SPEED CONTROL MALFUNCTIONS CAUSING RAPID ACCELERATION    NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DRIVE THE CAR WITH MUCH CAUTION AND A LOT LESS ENJOYMENT.  *TR",

A MONTH LATER MY TACH STARTED ACTING STRANGE AND IS NOW STUCK IN ONE POSITION AND HAS BEEN THAT WAY FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS.

THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF CAR, JUST SEARCH \"2005 MUSTANG INSTRUMENT CLUSTER\" ON GOOGLE AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.  EVIDENTLY THE MOTORS IN THESE CLUSTERS, WHICH OPERATE YOUR INSTRUMENT DIAL NEEDLES, FAIL REGULARLY.      MY CAR IS A 2005, WITH 55,000 MILES ON IT.  SERVICED REGULARLY AND WELL CARED FOR. FIRST, MY TACH STARTED MALFUNCTIONING.  I FIGURED IT WAS COLD, AND IT ONLY DID IT SPORADICALLY, SO I LIVED WITH IT.  HOWEVER, TWO MONTHS AFTER THE TACH STARTED ACTING UP, THE SPEEDOMETER STARTED MALFUNCTIONING AS WELL. I DID NOT FEEL IT WOULD BE SAFE TO IGNORE THAT.  SO I CONTACTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM ON THE PHONE, AND THE FIRST THING THE SERVICE PERSON SAID WAS \"IT'S THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER MOST LIKELY.  $500-800 TO REPAIR.    WHEN I GOT HOME,  I STARTED RESEARCHING, INITIALLY JUST TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE PART CHEAPER.  THE GOOGLE SEARCH I DID PULLED UP ENTIRE FORUMS DEDICATED TO THIS PROBLEM.  THAT'S WHEN I WENT FROM RESIGNED TO MAD.  FORD IS PUTTING THE ONUS ON THE NHTSA TO INITIATE A RECALL.  AND THEY SAID YOU WON'T DO IT IF SAFETY IS NOT EFFECTED.  WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT ME AND I'M SURE EVERY STATE TROOPER ON THE PLANET, WOULD CONSIDER A MALFUNCTIONING SPEEDOMETER TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE. AND WITH THE ECONOMY AS IT IS, AND FORD CHARGING $500-$800 TO REPAIR WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW IS A FAULTY SYSTEM, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT FIXED.  AND TAKE THAT 25 MPH CURVE AT 35 OR 40 INSTEAD.  THAT'S NOT ONLY GOING TO BE ILLEGAL....IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS.     WE WERE ADVISED ON THE FORUM TO WRITE BOTH FORD AND THE NHTSA.

I HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS ISSUES AND COMPLAINTS PERTAINING TO THE PARKING BRAKE/PARKING BRAKE CABLES WITH 2005 FORD MUSTANGS, BUT IT APPEARS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH FORD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE INEFFICIENCY OF THESE CABLES BY REPLACING THEM IN THE 2007 AND LATER MUSTANG MODELS.  THE RUBBER COATING OF THESE CABLES IS APPARENTLY INEFFICIENT IN KEEPING MOISTURE AND WATER OUT OF THE CABLE ITSELF AS EXPRESSED BY MANY UNHAPPY FORD MUSTANG OWNERS, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED MY CABLES TO RUST AND EVENTUALLY SNAP.  I FIND IT EXTREMELY ALARMING THAT THIS IS SUCH A PREVALENT COMPLAINT YET NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM BY EITHER FORD OR THE NHTSA.  HAD THE OWNER'S MANUAL ISSUED BY FORD NOT SAID \"PULL THE PARKING BRAKE HANDLE UP AS FAR AS POSSIBLE\" MY ISSUE AND POSSIBLY MANY OTHERS WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO FRUITION, SINCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO SECURE MY VEHICLE BASED ON THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS MY PARKING BRAKE CABLES BROKE AS A RESULT OF THE FAULTY RUBBER COATING.

ALL OF THE IDIOT LIGHTS CAME ON INDICATING FAILURE ACROSS THE BOARD.  THE TRACTION CONTROL WAS ALSO TURNED OFF.  WHEN I GOT IT HOME, I NOTICED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE CARPET WAS WET.  I OPENED THE PASSENGER SIDE ACCESS PANEL AND DISCOVERED WATER DRIPPING FROM THE GEM (GENERIC ELECTRIC MODULE).  THE UNIT HAD OBVIOUSLY SHORTED OUT CAUSING THE PROBLEMS (CONFIRMED BY WEB RESEARCH AT SEVERAL MUSTANG WEB SITES).  NEITHER THE DEALERSHIP OR FORD WILL PAY FOR THE REPAIR BECAUSE THE CAR IS 5 YEARS OLD, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LOW MILEAGE.  THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I PURCHASED DOES NOT COVER THIS DAMAGE EITHER.    SEARCHING FORD'S TSBS, REVEALED A TSB ON THE WATER PROBLEM, BUT NOTHING ON THE GEM.  FORD IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION, BASED ON OTHER COMPLAINTS, BUT HAS NOT RECALLED THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE IS IN THE PROCESS OF DRYING OUT AND HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED.  ESTIMATED COST IS AROUND $1000.00    I BELIEVE THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE.  HAD THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED DURING NIGHTTIME I WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANTLY BLIND DUE TO THE LOSS OF HEADLIGHTS, AND HIDDEN FROM OTHER DRIVERS DUE TO LACK OF REAR LIGHTS AND TURN INDICATORS.

WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR, THE AIR-BAG LIGHT STARTED COMING ON RANDOMLY.  IT MIGHT NOT COME ON FOR DAYS, THEN DECIDES TO COME ON.  THE OWNER'S MANUAL SAYS IF THIS LIGHT COMES ON TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, NOTHING ELSE.  THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT IT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION, I WAS TOLD IF IT WASN'T ON IT WASN'T A PROBLEM.  WITHIN MY SECOND YEAR OF OWNERSHIP, THE AIR-BAG LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE.  THIS TIME THE SERVICE AGAIN SAW THE LIGHT ON.  THEY KEPT THE CAR, SOLD ME A BATTERY SERVICE WHERE THEY REMOVED THE CABLE AND SPRAYED ANTI-CORROSION STUFF ON THE TERMINAL.  THIS DID NOT CHANGE THE RANDOM LIGHT COMING ON WHILE DRIVING.  I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE FORD MUSTANG RECALL TO RE-PROGRAM THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.  THIS DID NOT CHANGE THE RANDOM LIGHT COMING ON WHILE DRIVING.  RECEIVED A CALL IN MAY 2008 THAT THEY HAD A REPLACEMENT SENSOR FOR MY CAR.  BROUGHT IT IN AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE WRONG SENSOR.  THE SERVICE AGENT TOLD ME TO CALL BACK LATER (NO SPECIFIC TIME LINE)TO SEE IF THEY HAD THE NEW SENSOR.  THE CAR'S WARRANTY WAS UP IN JULY 2008, THE LIGHT COMES ON ALL THE TIME, AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SENSOR FOR MY CAR, BUT THERE ARE 5 DEALERS IN TOWN THAT HAVE THEM.  I PLAN TO BRING THE CAR BACK THIS NEXT WEEK FOR THEM TO FIX THE SENSOR, AND FEEL THEY SHOULD HONOR THE WARRANTY.  WHETHER THEY FIX THE PROBLEM OR NOT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. *TR",
