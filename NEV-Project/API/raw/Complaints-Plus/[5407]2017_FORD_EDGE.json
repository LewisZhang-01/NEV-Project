In the intervening week, the vehicle had a rough idle for the first thirty seconds after startup. The second mechanic pulled the same codes and put a scope into the engine. The scope confirmed that there was a crack in the No. 2 cylinder that was allowing coolant into the engine. They advised that the car would likely need a new engine. They provided TSB 19-2346 and recommended I take the vehicle to the Ford dealership for further investigation. Classic Ford states that the vehicle will require a new engine at a cost of $7,500. Dealership cautioned against any additional miles being put on car, since a failure could result in damage to transmission.

After starting the vehicle back up, the warning lamp was no longer lit.  While accelerating to highway speeds entering the highway, the engine flex plate gave out and all power from the engine was lost.  The vehicle still kept power to the electrical systems (Power steering, A/C, lights, etc.) but no power was being pushed to the wheels. Had the incident happened at full highway speeds, it is unknown what damage could have occurred.   This is the assumption from myself due to the symptoms provided from the vehicle at the halt. Symptoms include: Grinding/Rattling sound from the rear of the engine, sounds more prevalent at idle and when shifting into gear, loss of power to wheels, and no other systems have issue after incident.  Vehicle is currently at Herlong Ford (SC Ford Dealer) awaiting diagnostic and possible maintenance after the incident.  I would assume the vehicle would be available for inspection upon request.  After conducting research, we are now aware of a known recall on this specific vehicle for its age and time of manufacturing.

I notified the Ford Dealership (FD) (Lithia Ford of Fresno California) on my next oil change on December 15, 2021.   Based on my ocular inspection the crack/break appears to emanate from a bubble in the tempered glass roof as opposed to FD\u2019s opinion that object impact caused the cracking.   In my online research, cracking, popping and even exploding without impact have happened to tempered automotive glasses have occurred across different vehicle models across different vehicle manufacturers.   The presence of bubbles in the manufacturing process have caused weak points across the surfaces of many tempered automotive glass resulting in cracking, breaking, popping and exploding. When this occurs, vehicle occupants as well as other moving motorists could be injured.   The tempered automotive glass that exhibit bubbles should not be installed by vehicle manufacturers like Ford.  Intensified quality control of tempered automotive glass should be done by vehicle manufacturers before these are installed.   Tempered panoramic glass roofing ( sunroof & moonroof) found with bubbles that are installed in all vehicles should be inspected and replaced if necessary to prevent injury to vehicle occupants and moving motorists.",

Our technician did some more research and came across a service bulletin from Ford (19-2346) regarding 2.0 L Ecoboost engines. Our Ford Edge falls under the service bulletin. The technician informed us that the only fix would be a completely new engine which we had to pay for.

It is a known problem with Ford Motor company and I believe there should be, if not a class action lawsuit against the company.  My car is past the standard powertrain warranty and I declined extended warranty when I purchased the car.  The check engine light came in.  I took it to car dealer to figure out what was wrong and Kenny Ross Ford in Adamsburg, PA said I need a new engine.  It is a 2017 Ford Edge with 73,000 miles.  The local service center said it would be about 8-9k to fix it.  There was not an issue with the vehicle reported under warranty.  It sputtered a bit over the past three years, but I thought nothing of it.   Normally I would just say it\u2019s my bad luck, however this is a known problem with Ford Motor company.  When my wife dropped the car off the dealership, the gentlemen at the dealer said he hopes it isn\u2019t an engine replacement because it is common for that car.  He didn\u2019t even look at the car before saying that and he knew exactly what was going on.  My wife told me about it so I immediately looked online.   (See link at the end of this message with similar complaints about this car) One owner said they contacted the Kentucky attorney general\u2019s office as well.   Some of them said they had to replace the engine a second time after two years.  Hundreds of people are reporting the SAME EXACT PROBLEM and it appears like the new motor they put eventually fails again.  I feel that Ford Motor is purposefully hiding a design flaw and don\u2019t want to issue a recall because of the cost.  I feel cheated and I want them to replace my motor at no cost or buy my car back from me at full KBB trade in value at excellent condition.   I contacted them directly on Friday and informed them that I was contacting the attorney generals office.  I told them I want an engine replacement and I should not be responsible for it.    https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Discussion-t69477_ds1054339",

        "summary": "The engine in the 2017 Ford Explorer has a history of seizing, catching fire and failure without notice.  This could cause serious injury or death.   This is a very well known problem at Ford Motor Company and they are doing nothing to fix it. In fact they are hiding from it.    The internet is loaded with information on this.  The coolant leaks into the engine and destroys it.   This has happened so much there are no more engines available in the country. It's not a matter if, it's a matter of when it will happen.   40,000 miles?  60,000 miles?   My car has 77,000 miles.    Ford is asking customers replace the engine at $7700 to the customer.  There should be a recall and replacement process from Ford Motor Company fully funded by Ford.  They engineered a bad engine.   Sold it to the public.  And they are ignoring the safety of the public for money.     I have dealt with Morrie's Minnetonka Ford in Minnetonka Minnesota and they say Ford will not recall the engine despite the danger to the public.  As usual it's all about the money.

While there is not definite evidence of a coolant leak, it is suspected a leak may have initiated the issue. Research has also indicated the engine block is most likely cracked. While driving, the engine would often lull and stop accelerating. This happened several times as I attempted to drive down the interstate, being forced to exit the highway due to not being able to move with the speed of traffic. After the first repair of the spark plugs, the car seemed to drive fine, however, they shouldn't have gone bad within a year of install indicating a much larger issue. The car is unable to be driven.

Baxter determined this was due to Safety recall 20S42 / NHTSA recall 20V-469.  After repair was made on the front flexible brake lines the car was still not performing correctly and Baxter determined the right rear brake line also needed to replaced.  This was not covered under the recall or the warranty.  I called my ASE certified mechanic, who has been servicing all of my vehicles for over 10 years, to discuss with them.  They told me the front and rear brakes lines are separate from each other, but they have been servicing many Ford vehicles with same rear brake line problem and just had 2 Ford F150's the previous week, one with about the same mileage as my vehicle (61,000).    I am diligent with servicing my car for maintenance, oil changes and repair.  My vehicle had been in to my mechanic on Feb. 18, 2021 at 57,318 miles and all fluids were also checked and everything was fine.  On May 24, 2021 at 61,892 miles my 2 front brake lines and one rear brake all lost their fluid at the same time.   Baxter Ford filed a request with Ford to have this covered for repair and it was denied.  I contacted Ford to request to have this reviewed and was denied.  However, I was told just to hold on to my receipt in case the NHTSA files a recall and would be reimbursed at that time.   I have also talked to several other Ford vehicle owners who have experienced the same problem and I think this needs to be reviewed.

I THINK FORD SHOULD BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENGINE REPLACEMENT AS THE ENGINE HAS FAILED BEFORE 62,000 MILES. A CAR ENGINE SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER. AFTER DOING RESEARCH I HAVE SEEN COMPLAINTS OF DOZENS OF SIMILAR CASES OF THE ECOBOOST ENGINES HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND BELEIVE IT HAS A DESIGN FLAW.",

AT THIS POINT MY SUV STILL RUNS BUT I PREFER TO NOT DRIVE IT ANYMORE BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE MORE DAMAGE TO IT, SO I DONT HAVE A CAR TO GET TO WORK. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF ENGINE IS IT OR IF THIS HAS JUST HAPPENED TO ME AND I FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A RECALLOF THIS MAKE AND MODEL.

I'M RETIRED AND DRIVE CONSERVATIVELY COASTING TO A STOP AS OFTEN AS I CAN AND ACCELERATING IN A VERY MODEST MANNER.  I ALSO THE DRIVE THE 2015 FORD EDGE IN A SIMILAR MANNER BUT GET MPG THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE STICKER STATED MPG.  OTHERWISE THE 2017 FORD EDGE RUNS SMOOTHLY FROM WHAT I CAN TELL.  CAN I GET SOME CONSIDERATION FOR THIS MISREPRESENTATION OF MPG FROM FORD?",

I TOOK IT TO MY DEALER AND THEY VERIFIED THAT THE CAR HAS VERY LOW VISIBILITY ON THE LOW BEAMS.  THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I CONTACTED THE FORD MOTOR CO AND THEY TOLD ME THAT CAR WAS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED.  THAT IS MY ISSUE.  I DRIVE A LOT AT NIGHT AND THIS IS VERY MUCH A SAFETY CONCERN.  I HAVE OWNED 6 FORD PRODUCTS IN THE PAST AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE OF LIGHTING.  I ALSO HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH THRU THE INTERNET AND HAVE NOTICED MANY MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FORD EDGE LOW BEAM POOR PERFORMANCE.  I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.  IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT. I REALLY HATED TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION BUT I FEEL THERE IS A RISK TO FORD EDGE OWNERS. I WAS TOLD BY FORD THAT MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK INTO AFTERMARKET HEADLIGHTS BUT THAT SOUNDED ODD TO ME AS I HAVE PAID $ 40,000 FOR A CAR WITH POOR LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS. THIS IS A CONCERN THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  FORD SAID THAT THE CAR IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED.  I DISAGREE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",

COPIES OF THE EXPERT MECHANICS' REPORT AND THE REPORT FROM THE METALLURGIST, WHO WAS HIRED TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS AND THE FAILURE MODE OF THE BRAKE BRACKET REMOVED FROM MY VEHICLE AFTER THE ACCIDENT, ARE ATTACHED TO THIS COMPLAINT. DURING THE METALLURGICAL STUDY A BRAND NEW BRAKE BRACKET WAS ANALYZED AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE SIMILAR CRACKS.  WHEN THE BRAKE BRACKET FRACTURED AND FAILED, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND I LOST THE ABILITY TO DECELERATE THE VEHICLE. NONE OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON. THE KEY-LESS IGNITION WOULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS TO USE BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE SWITCHED OFF THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS TO THE AIR BAGS. MY FULL ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON STEERING THE VEHICLE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS MULTIPLE LANES OF TRAFFIC AND GET ONTO THE ENTRANCE RAMP TO REDUCE SPEED. SEE THE ATTACHED POLICE REPORT FOR A SUMMARY OF THE ACCIDENT.    A FORD ENGINEERING REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE INVESTIGATION SINCE APRIL AND FAILED TO INCLUDE OTHER FORD AND SUPPLIER PERSONNEL IN THE JOINT REVIEW OF THE DEFECTIVE PART OR SUGGESTED ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING.

I REFUSED TO HAND OVER THE PART AND OFFERED JOINT REVIEWS AND TESTING. FORD REFUSED MY OFFER AND BASICALLY SAID TO TAKE THEM TO COURT.    CONTRARY TO WHAT FORD MAY CLAIM, THE DAMAGED VEHICLE AND DEFECTIVE PART ARE STILL OWNED BY ME, BUT BEING HELD BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY SINCE TESTING.  *BF  *TR",
