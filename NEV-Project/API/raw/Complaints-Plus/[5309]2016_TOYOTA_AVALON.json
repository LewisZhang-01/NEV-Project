I WAS PRESSING THE BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD AND WAS TRYING TO GRAB THE GEAR SHIFT TO PUT INTO PARK.

THE VIEW OF TRAFFIC TO EITHER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE IS DIMINISHED, WHICH HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN ONE CLOSE CALL WHEN CHANGING LANES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE LANE-WARNING INDICATOR LIGHTS THAT ARE PART OF THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SIMILARLY DIMINISHED, REDUCING THE FLASHING SAFETY WARNINGS THAT THEY PROVIDE.    WHILE THIS HAS NOT RESULTED IN A COLLISION, YET, IT HAS A HIGH POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO A COLLISION.  IT IS ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE THESE OUTSIDE MIRRORS WHEN THEY ARE WASHED OUT BY THE REFLECTIONS OF THE DASHBOARD WHEN SIMPLY MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WHEN NOT CHANGING LANES.
