This condition happens when there is a passenger and when there is not a passenger and is an intermittent fault. More and more reports of this issue are becoming more common. History codes in the Passenger Presence System point to the passenger seat sensor. In order to solve the issue, you have to replace the sensor in the seat. The sensor replacement requires a tech to remove the seat, open it, change the part and then reinstall it. This service charges ~$1,200 at my dealership. This is a safety issue that has been well-documented in a large number of official reports, and reports online. This is also something that GM knows about and is refusing to fix on affected vehicles.",

THAT THESE TIRES SEEMINGLY NEED REPLACING AT THE RATE OF ONE TIRE ROUGHLY EVERY 6K TO 12K MILES SUGGESTS THEY SUFFER FROM A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN DEFICIENCY.   I GATHER MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT A FLUKE.

        "summary": "I WAS ON MY WAY HOME, IT WAS VERY DARK OUTSIDE ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY GOING 60-60MPH AND WANTED TO SWITCH OVER TO ELECTRIC \"HOLD\" MODE SO I COULD SAVE THE ELECTRIC BATTERY FOR CITY DRIVING. I GLANCED OVER AND HIT THE \"DRIVE MODE\" BUTTON THREE TIMES THINKING I WAS GOING TO SEND THE DRIVE MODE DOWN TO \"HOLD\". INSTEAD WHAT I DID WAS POWERED OFF THE CAR BY HITTING THE POWER BUTTON.  (THE TWO BUTTONS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND BOTH REQUIRE MULTIPLE PRESSES TO WORK).      SO THERE I WAS, THE CAR WENT BLACK INSIDE AND THE HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF OUTSIDE WHILE I WAS GOING 65MPG ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY (ONE LANE EACH DIRECTION). THANK GOD THERE WAS NOBODY AROUND OR CLOSE TO ME AND THANKFULLY THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH AMBIENT LIGHT FROM THE MOON TO SEE WHERE I WAS. I HIT THE POWER BUTTON TO TRY TURNING IT BACK ON, NOTHING. LUCKILY THE HAZARD SWITCH REMAINED LIT AND I WAS ABLE TO TURN MY HAZARDS ON. I HAD TO STOP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, PUT IT BACK INTO PARK AND HIT POWER.    I REALIZE I HIT THE WRONG BUTTON BUT WHY SHOULD SUCH AN EASY MISTAKE ALMOST CAUSE A FATALITY. IF NOT FOR THE MOON I MIGHT HAVE DROVE OFF THE ROAD AND INTO A TELEPHONE POLE.    I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEY MOVE THE POWER BUTTON TO THE STEERING COLUMN, SIMILAR TO WHERE A KEY WOULD BE LOCATED. FOR GODS SAKE, DON'T PUT A MULTIPLE CLICK BUTTON NEXT TO ANOTHER MULTIPLE CLICK BUTTON THAT HAS SUCH SIGNIFICANCE IN THE OUTCOME OF YOUR LIFE.    AND FOR GOD SAKES, DON'T TURN OFF THE HEADLIGHTS IF THE COMPUTER DETECTS I'M GOING 65 AND KNOWS VIA THE SENSOR THAT IT'S DARK OUTSIDE!     THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AT VARIOUS WEB SITES, INCLUDING....     HTTP://GM-VOLT.COM/FORUM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?17249-POWER-BUTTON-TOO-CLOSE-TO-DRIVE-MODE-BUTTON!    SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE HAVE A FATALITY SOON IF THIS IS NOT FIXED.  *TR",

IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THE MAIN CABIN FROM THE TRUNK IN THE VOLT, SO IT ISN'T A REAL SAFETY ISSUE, BUT IT SHOULD BE TRACKED SINCE I'M SURE CHEVROLET USES SIMILAR DEVICES IN THEIR OTHER CARS.  *TR",
