NO TIRE ROTATIONS) DONE TO THE CAR RECENTLY...    EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN I NOTICED A STRONG PULLING OF THE CAR TO THE LEFT.  THE NEXT TIME I DROVE THE CAR I NOTICED A STRONG PULL TO THE RIGHT, WHICH SEEMED VERY STRANGE SINCE IT WAS NOT THE LEFT AS BEFORE.  THIS PULLING TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER HAS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES OVER THE LAST WEEK NOW.  THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION I HAVE LEARNED THAT TURNING THE IGNITION OFF AND RESTARTING SEEMS TO CLEAR THE PROBLEM - IF THE FRONT WHEELS ARE POINTED STRAIGHT FORWARD.  I BELIEVE HAVING THE FRONT WHEELS POINTING STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEN I SHUT OFF / RESTART SEEMS TO CORRECT THE PULLING PROBLEM.  BUT IF THE WHEELS ARE POINTED LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN I RESTART THE CAR, THE CAR PULLS THAT DIRECTION WHEN RESTARTED.    I'M NO AUTOMOTIVE MECHANIC, BUT BASED ON WHAT I THINK I'VE LEARNED, THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTRONIC ONE.

ON 07/10/18, TOYOTA CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR RESPONDED MAINTAINING THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF DEFECT.

THE TOYOTA CAMRY LE 2016 CAR WHICH WAS ON LEASE FROM THE TOYOTA F OVER 20 MONTHS COMPLETELY TOTALED OUT. THE CAR WAS HIT ON THE NON DRIVER REAR SEAT BY THE OTHER CAR WHILE TURNING. THE IMPACT WAS OF AT LEAST 30-40 M/HR OF THE SPEED.ABOVE  CAR SPINNED 180 DEGREE ENDED UP STOPPING DUE TO ROAD SIDE PAVEMENT IN THE OPPOSITE ROAD.  THE IMPACTED SIDE WHEEL WAS BROKEN AND ROTATED OUT.    THE IMPACT WAS SEVERE BUT THE AIR BAGS MAINLY ON THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT AND REAR SEAT DID NOT OPEN AT ALL. THE REMAINING OPEN BAG WAS FLOPPY.   BEING A MEDICAL PHYSICIAN, THIS IS SURPRISING AND DISTURBING TO ME.  AS THE MOST FATAL CAR INJURY OCCUR DUE TO THE DECELERATION INJURIES DUE TO STEERING WHEEL IMPACT THAT CAN LEAD MAJOR VESSEL LIKE AORTA / HEART RUPTURE.   I SEE IT AS THE MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN THE CAR.IN THE BACK, BOTH BABY CAR SEATS WERE DAMAGED . FORTUNATELY, MY WIFE DROPPED MY CHILDREN 0.3  MILE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT SITE TO THE DAY CARE WHO IS  A 4 MONTH OLD INFANT. I AM VERY SURE THAT IF ANY OF MY CHILDREN WOULD BE IN THE BACK SEAT, THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE LIFE THREATENING.S. MY WIFE HAS A CHEST PAIN AND BACK PAIN DECELERATION INJURY CAUSING FRONT CHEST PAIN, HEAD CONCUSSION AND OTHER INJURIES RELATED.     I  EXPECT SAFETY SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY WHEN COME TO HUMAN LIFE.  WE WERE PLANNING TO KEEP THIS CAR AS WE SPEND LEASE MONEY IN TO IT. HOWEVER DUE TO  THE ACCIDENT AND TOTAL LOSS OF CAR. IT  HAS EFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION TO BUY A NEW CAR. THIS IS EFFECTING OUR WORK AS WE ENDED UP IN URGENT SITUATION TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR TO PURCHASE A NEW CAR.    I HAVE READ THE NHTSA INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAR BAGS AND OTHER DETAILED WHICH FURTHER CONFIRMS MY DOUBT. THANKS.

LAST NOVEMBER, WHEN I WAS DRIVING THIS CAR ON I75, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF SUDDENLY AND THE DASHBOARD WAS DEAD AS WELL . I WAS SO SCARED AND PULLED THE CAR OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. WHEN I CALMED DOWN , I TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE, AND IT WORKED AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW CAR AND DID NOT REPORT THIS TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY.  WHEN MY FIRST SCHEDULED SERVICE VISIT ON JANUARY THIS YEAR, I TOLD THE DEALER WHAT HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE CAR CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY. THEY TOLD ME THEY DID NOT HEAR OF THE THING I TOLD THEM EVER HAPPENED ON CAMRY BEFORE AND AGREE TO TAKE A LOOK. THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR. BUT TWO WEEKS LATER, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AGAIN WHEN I DRIVING THE CAR ON HIGHWAY I75. THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I CALLED TOYOTA THOUGH THE NUMBER 800-331-4331, AND THEY SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SIMILAR CASE REPORTED AND SUGGESTED ME TO CHECK MY CAR AT THE DEALER. I STOPPED BY THE DEALER AND THEY DROVE MY CAR ON THE HIGHWAY TRYING TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT FAILED. THEY ALSO CHECK THE CAR THOROUGHLY AND FOUND NOTHING UNNORMAL.
