WE WERE DRIVING HOME FROM OUR FAMILY TRIP TRAVERSING ON A 2 WAY ROAD ALONG A CLIFF AND THE LEFT REAR 2ND AXLE TIRE BLEW OUT. WE BARELY WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD. I PUT OUT OUR WARNING DEVICES AND ALSO HAD MY WIFE TRY TO SLOW AND DIVERT TRAFFIC TO THE NEXT LANE. I PURCHASED 4 NEW TIRES FOR MY RV ON MARCH,20 2021 AND IN TOTAL THEY ONLY HAVE 210 MILES ON THEM AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. WHEN I GOT HOME I PERFORMED AN EXAMINATION OF THE TRAILER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG. I FOUND THAT THE TIRE RUBBED SO HARD AGAINST THE TRAILER THAT THE TIRE BLEW OUT. NOW THERE IS DAMAGE TO THE INNER FENDER WHEEL AND INTERIOR OF THE TRAILER. UPON INSPECTING THE SUSPENSION, I FOUND MULTIPLE CRACKS, POOR STRUCTURAL SUPPORT, WELDS THAT HAVE NO PENETRATION, SUSPENSION HANGERS, AND FRAME TWISTING. ALTHOUGH I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL NEITHER MYSELF NOR MY FAMILY WERE HURT IN THIS INCIDENT I DO STILL FEEL THIS IS TRULY GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND THIS NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY. I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH ECLIPSE AND/OR LIPPERT TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE REPAIRS AND HAVE THE RV TOWED THERE SINCE THE RV IS UNFIT DOT COMPLIANCE.",
