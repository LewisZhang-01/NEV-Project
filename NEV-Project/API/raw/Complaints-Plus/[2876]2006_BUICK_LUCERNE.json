ON MAY 25, I TOOK IT TO REICHARD, DEALERSHIP.  SINCE THE CAR HAS ONLY 54, 589 MILES ON IT I ASKED THE DEALER FOR ASSISTANCE IN PAYING TO FIX IT.  HE REFUSED, SAYING \"WE GET A LOT OF THESE.  THE MANUFACTURER USED PLASTIC INSTEAD OF METAL AND THE PLASTIC BREAKS.\"  I ASKED THE ADVISOR TO CALL GENERAL MOTORS.  SHE DID AND REPORTED BACK TO ME THAT GM WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. ONE OF THE ADVISORS TOLD ME THAT I CAN EXPECT THE OTHER THREE DOOR HANDLES TO BREAK AS WELL.  SINCE THE CAR ONLY HAS 54K MILES, HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?  I HAVE THREE OTHER CARS AND ONLY DRIVE THE LUCERNE A FEW TIMES A YEAR, MAINLY ON OUT-OF-TOWN TRIPS.  THEREFORE, I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR ONLY ABOUT 5,500 MILES PER YEAR.  I CONSIDER THIS A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING OF THIS VEHICLE.  THIS DEFECT WILL COST ME ABOUT $1,000. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD IF/WHEN A I NEED TO TO ENTER THE CAR AND WHEN SOMEONE HAS TO BE QUICKLY EXTRACTED FROM THE CAR!  ALSO, A FEW FRIENDS AND COMPLETE STRANGERS WHO OWN BUICK LUCERNES HAVE TOLD ME THAT I CAN EXPECT TO HAVE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR.  HAVE YOU HAD COMPLAINTS WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS?",

THERE WAS AN AUDIBLE SIGNAL ACCOMPANIED BY A \"SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL\" WARNING, FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A THROTTLE CONTROL WARNING AND COMPLETE ENGINE SHUTDOWN.  I WAS ABLE TO COAST ACROSS 2 TRAFFIC LANES INTO A PARKING AREA WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY WHILE STEERING AND BRAKING WITHOUT POWER ASSIST.  TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE BUT GOT ?THROTTLE DISABLED?

I HAD DISABLED TRACTION CONTROL EARLIER IN HOPES OF AVOIDING ANOTHER UNEXPECTED SHUTDOWN.  AFTER COASTING OFF THE INTERSTATE, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART NORMALLY AFTER A FEW MINUTES.  NO WARNING LIGHTS APPEARED AFTER THE RESTART.    TWO GM DEALERS CHECKED THE CAR ON MAR 11, 2014.

I HAVE ALSO TALKED TO A GMC DEALER IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND ASKED IT ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD A VEHICLE THAT JUST SPEEDS UP ON IT'S OWN.

THE FIRST TIME THIS VEHICLE DID THIS TO ME WAS ON MY WAY TO THE LAKE OF THE OZARKS.  I COME FROM A SMALL TOWN THERE IS REALLY NO WHERE THAT I CAN USE THE CRUISE CONTROL EXCEPT ON LARGER TRIPS.  WE HAVE A LOT OF HILLS AND CURVES.  GOING TO THE LAKE OF THE OZARKS THE SPEED LIMIT IS 70.  I USED THE CRUISE CONTROL.  I GOT BEHIND A TRAILER THAT WAS GOING VERY SLOW AND TRAFFIC WAS A LITTLE BUSY, SO I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND WHEN TRAFFIC WAS CLEAR I PASSED THE TRAILER.  I WAS GOING TO RESUME THE CRUISE CONTROL, BUT BEFORE I EVEN TOUCHED THE BUTTON, MY CAR TOOK OFF AND I WAS AT 93 MILES AN HOUR AND I HIT THE BRAKE AND IT WOULD NOT STOP.  I THEN TAPPED THE BRAKES SEVERAL TIMES QUICKLY AND IT STARTED TO SLOW DOWN.  WHEN I GOT THE SPEED DOWN TO 55, I THEN APPLIED MY FOOT BACK TO THE GAS PEDAL AND WHEN I DID, THE GAS PEDAL WAS NOT DOWN OR STUCK, BUT I COULD FEEL A LITTLE SOMETHING IN IT.  THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT FEEL IN IT ALL THE TIME.  I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND TOLD MY HUSBAND ABOUT IT AND HE SAID YOU MUST HAS HIT SOMETHING WRONG.  I SAID NO I'M TELLING YOU IT DID IT ON IT'S OWN.    I GO TO WORK AT 4:00 AM IN THE MORNING.  WHERE I LIVE THERE IS A LOT OF DEER, SO I DO NOT DRIVE FAST FOR ABOUT 3 MILES TO WORK.

THE RIGHT FRONT PART OF OUR CAR HIT A GUARDRAIL, SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL MOMENTARILY, THEN LOST CONTROL AGAIN. THE CAR SPUN AROUND AND HIT THE CEMENT BARRIER, WHERE THE CAR STOPPED. DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE RIGHT REAR AND THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL WAS  COMPLETELY SEVERED FROM THE VEHICLE.

THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY AND HAD APPROXIMATELY 18,000 MILES.  FORTUNATELY, MY WIFE WAS NOT INJURED AND NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $10,000 IN DAMAGES TO THE CAR.  OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT THE WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY SEVERED FROM THE CAR. THE TIRE IS NOT FLAT, BUT THE WHEEL SEPARATED AT THE HUB (I THINK THAT IS THE CORRECT TERM). SINCE THIS IS A NEW CAR (2006 WAS THE FIRST MODEL), WE WONDER WHETHER THERE MAY BE SOME TYPE OF DEFECT? WE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE WHEEL WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE (INTACT) WHEN SHE WAS NEVER GOING MORE THAN 35-40 AND, MOST LIKELY, SLOWER THAN THAT WHEN SHE HIT THE CEMENT BARRIER.
