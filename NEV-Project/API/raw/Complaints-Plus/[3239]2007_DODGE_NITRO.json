And a few weeks ago the brake came undone somehow and fell into the wheel well, ripping the inside of the rim open causing a blow out while my wife, 2 year old and I were on the freeway. And now after taking it to 2 different dodge dealerships, the problems are not fixed, there is more warning lights on than I've ever seen.  And so far both places have told me they fixed an emblem on the steering wheel,  and that the other recalls aren't applicable because of being a 2007 and the recalls are for the 2008. Even though my nitro is obviously having the same if not worse problems.  All the way down to the emergency brake not working,  we love our nitro and dodge as a company and would please like some kind of help with this situation.  Our vehicle is our only source of transportation and it is not safe for us to be driving, especially in the winter conditions we just got hit with here.  Thank you for your help to whom this may concern.  Here are some pictures of what happened with the brakes,  thank the lord we were getting off the freeway when the brakes gave way, if we had been on the freeway 15 seconds more, the accident would have been fatal without question.",

Most recent today 12-17-21 was placed in extremely dangerous situation and was almost rear ended 5 times by other vehicles traveling at speeds greater than 55 mph.  1st instance occurred back in 2007 traveling West bound on I635 in Dallas (speed of 65mph) engine shut off, loss of power steering coasted to side of road.  2nd incident Fall 2007 - from complete stop to turn left and cross divided highway, the engine shut down right in the middle of the intersection and was nearly broadsided by oncoming car traveling at 45 mph.  3rd incident happened while driving in my neighborhood, engine shut down and loss of power to steering.  Daimler Chrysler issued a recall to reprogram the TPIM module back in 2008 to address the problem.  Nothing since then until today.  I am the original Owner of this car and it has been well maintained and is still covered under the manufacturers warranty for as long as I own the vehicle.  What has prompted me to report this problem is the fact that I could have been seriously injured. There was no warning whatsoever and the place where this took place had a blind spot as the car lost power during the climb and coasted at 2 mph down slope on a bend on the bridge.  Cars traveling towards me had no visibility to my vehicle which was for all practical purposes at a stand still. I notified the Dodge Chrysler dealership of what took place and will also contact MOPAR to raise this serious problem.  If a vehicle doesn't start is one thing, but to have a car loose power out of nowhere without warning has almost cost me serious harm on multiple occasions. Daimler Chrysler should do something before loss of life takes place.",

I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY QUOTED ME ALMOST $200 FOR EACH DOOR AND CONFIRMED THAT IT IS BROKEN DOOR HANDLE. AFTER DECIDING TO FOR GO REPAIRS I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED THAT MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A CHILD MIGHT BE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK CLIMBS INTO THE VEHICLE AND CAN'T GET OUT. THE ONLY WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR IS TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW WHICH ARE ELECTRIC AND REACH HAND OUT AND OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE. SO THAT IS A SECOND SAFETY ISSUE IF CAR BATTERY GOES OUT AND YOU CAN'T OPEN WINDOW YOU ARE BASICALLY LOCKED IN YOUR CAR. I CONTACTED DODGE AND NO RECALL HAS BEEN PUT IN FOR THIS ISSUE.I URGE YOU TO PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND YOU WILL FIND MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS AND IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT I BELIEVE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

TRUCK WAS LEFT AT DEALER FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN GOING ON. BECAUSE OF THE QUOTED PRICE [$435], I SUGGESTED TO HER THAT I WOULD HAVE MY PERSONAL MECHANIC REPAIR IT AND WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE THE ACTUAL HARNESS KIT WHICH ONLY COST $32.92. PART COULD NOT BE PURCHASED BECAUSE IT WAS FLAGGED AS AN \"RECALL\". NATASHA CHECKED W/MIKE TO CONFIRM THIS INFO, DROP OFF DATE WAS SET - ASKED HER - THERE WILL BE NO CHARGE, CORRECT, SINCE THIS IS AN RECALL PART? SHE SAID NO, THERE WOULDN'T, THAT'S CORRECT. SERVICE TECH KENNEY HANDED ME A INVOICE FOR $415 STATING THERE WAS A CHARGE - WHICH I TOTALLY DISAGREED. ONCE NATASHA ARRIVED, WE DISCUSSED THIS MATTER IN TOTAL DISAGREEMENT SINCE I WAS UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING THIS WAS A \"RECALL\" PART AND WASN'T EXPECTING TO PAY AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.

I PULLED INTO THE CAR REPAIR SHOP AROUND 5:00 PM. I STATED TO THE RECEPTIONIST THAT MY CAR WAS OVERHEATING. THE NEXT DAY AFTER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE WATER PUMP HAD FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. PREVIOUSLY ON 3/14/2014 ANOTHER WATER PUMP FAILED AND WAS INSTALLED BY THE DEALER GLENN THOMAS DODGE. IN REVIEWING THE CAR'S RECORDS WITH DODGE CORPORATION DURING WARRANTY THERE WAS ANOTHER WATER PUMP WHICH FAILED AND WAS REPLACED IN 2011 BY GLENN THOMAS DODGE. THIS HAS MADE THREE (3)  TIMES THAT THE WATER PUMP HAS BEEN REPLACED IN MY DODGE NITRO 4X4 2007.",

MY REAR WINDOWS STOPPED WORKING, HAD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED WHICH I FOUND ODD BECAUSE I HARDLY USED THE BACK WINDOWS.    DRIVER'S SIDE HANDLE HAS SNAPPED IN HALF. THIS MAKES FOR A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I CANNOT GET OUT OF THE CAR WITHOUT ROLLING DOWN THE WINDOW AND THEN UNLOCKING MYSELF THEN ROLL UP THE WINDOW BEFORE TURNING OFF MY CAR. ALSO, THE POWER WINDOW CONTROL HAS SNAPPED OFF AS WELL FOR CONTROLLING THE FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW. I'M CONCERNED I WILL BE TRAPPED IN MY VEHICLE IF I CONTINUE TO LOSE POWER FUNCTIONS TO THE CAR.    HEATING UNIT WORKS SPORADICALLY. TOOK IT TO LOCAL MECHANIC HE FIXED IT.  IT WORKED TEMPORARILY AND THEN STOPPED.  CALLED DEALERSHIP AND ONCE AGAIN WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM A DIAGNOSTIC TEST;  WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE IF THIS WAS THE ONLY PROBLEM, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT.  *TR",

I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE NO FACTORY-INSTALLED FASTENERS HOLDING THE HEAT SHIELD IN PLACE.  I HAVE NOT EVER HAD MY CAR IN HIGH WATER AND UPON MY FURTHER EXAMINATION INCLUDING VIDEO DOCUMENTATION OF THE UNDER CARRIAGE, I POINTED OUT TO THE SERVICE TECH THAT THE FACTORY LABEL ON THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, MY OIL PAN LACKED DENTS OR DINGS, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE UNDER CARRIAGE, NOR DID I HAVE ANY WATER RELATED INTERIOR ISSUES.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT STILL REFUSED TO COVER THE DRIVE SHAFT AND HEAT SHIELD REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUGGESTED I MAKE A CLAIM TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TO CONTACT CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD OPEN A CLAIM.      I CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THEIR SERVICE TECH DETERMINED THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY WATER DAMAGE AND AFTER ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION I WAS TOLD, \"I AM NOT TECHNICALLY TRAINED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.?    I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY, BASED ON THEIR REVIEW/EVIDENCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE ANY CLAIM OF WATER DAMAGE.      I ALSO RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE ONLINE AND DETERMINED THAT THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED SEVERAL TIMES.  THE REPAIRS WILL COST OVER $1K. THIS SEEMS TO BE EITHER DEFECTIVE OR A FAULTY DESIGN AS THERE ARE NO FACTORY FASTENERS HOLDING THE HEAT SHIELD IN PLACE.   *TR",

I HAD MY BLINKER ON AND WAS READY TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN AS SOON AS THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I LIGHTLY STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR WHEN A LOUD EXPLOSION WAS HEARD AND FELT IN THE VEHICLE UNDERCARRIAGE.  THE VEHICLE'S DRIVE SHAFT HAD EXPLODED UPWARDS, HITTING THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND THEN DROPPING TO THE FLOOR.  THE VEHICLE LOST COMPLETE POWER AND STOPPED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DRIVELINE FELL OFF.  MY DAUGHTER AND NIECE FELT THE HIT IN GREATER MAGNITUDE AS THEY WERE SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT.  MY INSURANCE COVERED THE WRECKER AND TRANSPORTED THE VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST DODGE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY HEATSHIELD THAT FELL OFF THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND WAS RUBBING AGAINST THE ALUMINUM DRIVESHAFT.  SINCE THE HEATSHIELD IS MADE OF ALUMINUM AND FIBERGLASS, THE RUBBING OF ALUMINUM AGAINST ALUMINUM HAS A CUTTING EFFECT THAT CAUSED THE DRIVESHAFT TO CUT OPEN AND THEN EXPLODE CUTTING IT IN HALF.  LUCKILY, I WAS MAKING A TURN GOING NO MORE THAN 10 TO 15 MILES AN HOUR.  HAD I BEEN DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY THIS ISSUE WOULD HAVE LIKELY CAUSED A FATAL AND CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT.  THERE IS NO RECALL THAT I KNOW OF.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THE REPAIR AS IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE POLICY.  MY CAR INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER THE REPAIRS AS IT IS CONSIDERED A MECHANICAL FAILURE AND NOT A COLLISION.  DODGE SHOULD CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HEATSHIELD COMING OFF FROM THE UNDERCARRIAGE, AND RECALL VEHICLES TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.   *KB",

MY DOOR HANDLE BROKE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. SINCE THEN MY DOOR HANDLES HAS BROKEN SEVERAL TIMES AND I HAVE HAD TO SPEND ALOT OF MONEY TO REPLACE THEM EVERY TIME. I MAKE LESS THAN THE AVERAGE BLUE COLLAR WORKER AND DO NOT HAVE THE $175 EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE DOOR HANDLE  BREAKS. THEREFORE, AT TIMES SUCH AS NOW I HAVE TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE HANDLES BROKEN BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD IT. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO DOOR HANDLES BROKEN RIGHT NOW.    I FEEL THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE IF A CAR ACCIDENT WERE TO HAPPEN, AND THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO THE DOOR WITH THE BROKEN HANDLE NEEDED TO EXIT THE VEHICLE IN A HURRY, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT. ONCE THE HANDLE IS BROKEN, THE DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE. SO, LETS SAY THE VEHICLE WAS ON FIRE. THE PERSON NEXT TO THE DOOR WITH THE BROKEN HANDLE WOULD BE STUCK UNLESS SOMEONE OPENED THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE OR UNLESS THAT PERSON WERE TO QUICKLY ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN, REACH OUT AND OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE. I FEEL THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AND HAVE VOICED MY OPINION TO DODGE ABOUT THE ISSUE. I ASKED THEM TO START A RECALL OF THE ITEM AND FIND A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT FOR IT THAT WILL NOT BREAK ALL THE TIME. DODGE WOULD NOT EVEN HEAR MY CONCERNS AND POINTED ME TOWARDS THIS WEBSITE.     I HOPE THIS ISSUE IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS HAVING THIS ISSUE. MANY DODGE NITRO OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE OF YOU GOOGLE IT, YOU WILL SEE.

APPX. 1 HR AND 35 MINUTES LATER I WENT BACK OUTSIDE TO BRING IN SEVERAL ITEMS FROM MY TRUCK AND SUDDENLY SEE THE SHOCKING SITUATION UNFOLDING BEFORE MY EYES.  IN TOTAL DISBELIEF, I REALIZE THAT THE ENTIRE INSIDE OF MY TRUCK IS VIOLENTLY BURNING.      THE DAY BEFORE IT CAUGHT ON FIRE, STRANGE THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN WITH THE DASH CONTROLS.  WARNING LIGHTS STARTED TO COME ON AND THEN GO OFF, IT GOT STUCK IN 4WD AND WOULD NOT GO BACK TO 2WD AND OVERNITE WHILE IT WAS SITTING IN THE GARAGE IT TURNED ON THE BRAKE LIGHTS BY ITSELF AND THEY STAYED ON ALL NITE UNTIL DRAINING THE BATTERY.  ALL OF THESE STRANGE OCCURRENCES ARE ONE THING BUT FOR THE TRUCK TO BE JUST PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY AND SPONTANEOUSLY CATCH ITSELF ON FIRE IS TRULY SHOCKING.  IF IT HAD BEEN PARKED IN THE GARAGE THAT EVENING IT WOULD HAVE BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN AS WELL.  THE TRUCK WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND ALL OF IT'S CONTENTS.  AFTER THE FIRE TRUCKS PUT OUT THE FIRE, THE FIRE INVESTIGATOR EXPLAINED TO ME HOW THEY DETERMINE THE FIRES ORIGIN AND THE REPORT STATES THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE WAS IN THE STEERING COLUMN AND DASHBOARD AREA AS A RESULT OF DEFECTIVE AND/OR MALFUNCTIONING VEHICLE WIRING.  I REPORTED THE FIRE TO DODGE AND THEY ASKED THAT THE VEHICLE NOT BE MOVED AND SOMEONE WOULD RESPOND IN 2 DAYS.  IT'S A WEEK SINCE THE FIRE NOW AND NO ONE HAS CONTACTED ME AT ALL.

I WAS TOLD IT COST 75.00 FOR THE PART AND TWO HOURS OF LABOR AT $115.00 FOR A ESTIMATED TOTAL OF $300.00 TO REPLACE THE INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE. I FEEL THE PART IS POORLY MADE FOR ITS USE AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER SNAPPED OFF. I ALSO FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE DRIVER CANNOT MAKE A QUICK ESCAPE OUT OF THE CAR WHEN THIS PART UNEXPECTEDLY SNAPS. I WAS ALSO SURPRISED WHEN CONTACTING THE DODGE DEALERSHIP THAT THEY HAD THE PART IN STOCK, WHICH ALSO TELLS ME THEY MUST HAVE HAD TO REPLACE SEVERAL TO KEEP THAT PARTICULAR PART IN STOCK. *TR",

THEY SAID THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE THE WHOLE WIRING. THE BRANCH MANAGER NEVER TAKES THE TELEPHONE. BUT, AFTER ALL THESE LOCAL REPAIR WORK, HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT A SIMILAR INCIDENT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN?  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REASON WHY MY VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE JUST AFTER AN OIL CHANGE AND WHILE THE ENGINE WAS STILL OFF. IF THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT.

WE BROUGHT IT BACK THE VERY NEXT DAY, BECAUSE IT WASN'T RUNNING CORRECTLY, AND ALSO A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  BETWEEN JULY 8TH AND JANUARY 1, 2009, THAT VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF DAYTONA DODGE 11 OR 12 TIMES.  THEY HAVE HAD TO DROP THE TRANSMISSION ON THIS VEHICLE 3 TIMES; THEY BROUGHT IN A CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM DODGE OVER IN ORLANDO.  HE TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE WITH US, AND DID IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, AFTER INDUCTING THE VEHICLE BACK IN FOR SERVICE, THE PROBLEM WAS STILL NOT FIXED.  I WAS FINALLY TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT DAYTONA DODGES SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING THEY WERE TOLD TO DO, AND THAT THE VEHICLE IS JUST SUPPOSE TO RUN THAT WAY.  I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ANY CORPORATION WOULD MANUFACTURE A VEHICLE TO RUN THE WAY THIS NITRO DOES.  I HAVE DONE SOME INVESTIGATING, AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE DODGE NITRO.  THE NITRO I HAVE BOTH SHUDDERS AT AROUND 40 MPH AND ALSO HAS A PROBLEM IDLING, IT TRIES TO SHUT OFF PERIODICALLY WHILST AT A RED LIGHT.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO TREAT CUSTOMERS.  PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I AM WRITING TO YOU IN THE HOPES THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN GET SOMEONE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. *TR  UPDATED 03/06/09.*JB",

WE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEALER AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT. WE BROUGHT THE NITRO IN; THEY DID A COMPUTER FLASH UPDATE TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND SENT US ON OUR WAY. AGAIN, WE NOTICED THE SAME PROBLEM SHORTLY AFTER RETURNING HOME. SO, WE MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK IN. THEY DID THE SAME THIN(COMPUTER FLASH UPDATE) AND TOLD US WHATEVER RESIDUAL  SURGING WE FELT IN THE VEHICLE WAS NORMAL.  FOT THE THIRD TIME, WE BROUGHT IT HOME AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUED TO WORSEN, WE BROUGHT IT BACK IN TO THE DEALER.BUT THIS TIME WHILE I WAS THERE I TEST-DROVE ANOTHER NITRO OF THE EXACT KIND TO FIND THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT NORMAL. AFTER DOING THIS AND TELLING THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT THAT I HAD TEST-DROVE ANOTHER NITRO, THEY DECIDE WE NEEDE TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE TORQUE CONVERTER. WE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR A MONTH AWAY TO GIVE THEM TIME TO GET THE PARTS IN. ONCE AGAIN WE BROUGHT THE NITRO IN, THEY KEPT IT A FEW DAYS TO CHANGE OUT THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  WHEN WE PICKED IT UP THEY SAID IT WAS FIXED.  WE WERE EXCITED AND RELIEVED TO FINALLY GET THIS BEHIND US.  SOON AFTER THIS, THE SURGING WAS STILL TAKING PLACE, BUT NOW AT ANY SPEED WE TRIED TO HOLD STEADY.  WE CALLED AGAIN AND THEY TOLD US IT WAS NORMAL, I REMINDED THEM THAT I HAD TEST-DROVE THE EXACT CAR AND THAT IT WAS IN FACT, NOT NORMAL. YET AGAIN, THE SCHEDULED ANOTHER APPOINTMENTFOR USA TO BRING THE CAR IN.  THIS TIME THE HEAD MECHANIC DROVE IT WITH THE COMPUTER HOOKED UP TO IT. HE STATED THAT IT WAS GETTING WORSE, BUT THE COMPUTER WAS SHOWING NO ERRORS AND THEY COULD'NT FIX IT.    *JB",

A FEW DAYS  LATER THIS HAPPENED AGAIN, AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE  THE  CAR BACK TO US BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED IT UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY THREE TIMES.  THE BEGINNING OF JULY WHEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN THEY MIRACULOUSLY THAT MORNING RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL ON THE VEHICLE. I GUESS THE FIRST ONE DIDN'T WORK SO THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A WEEK SUPPOSEDLY FIXED IT AND 5 DAYS LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  MY HUSBAND DROVE IT TO THE DEALER ,AND THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE   KNEW  OF US BY FIRST NAME AT THIS POINT.  SAW HIM DRIVING IN AND RAN TO THE VEHICLE TELLING MY HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS  NOW A RECALL ON THE LAST RECALL!!!  I HAVE TWO CHILDREN,  THE YOUNGEST  BEING  16 MONTHS.  AND THE OLDEST  TWELVE.
