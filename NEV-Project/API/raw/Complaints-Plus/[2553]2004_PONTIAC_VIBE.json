IT HAS BEEN OVER ONE YEAR SINCE THE FIRST RECALL, WHICH I FIND UNACCEPTABLE.  FURTHER, I WILL BE REPLACING THE SUBJECT VEHICLE AND I WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME SELLING IT WITH TWO OPEN RECALLS.  I HAVE TRIED CALLING OUR LOCAL GM DEALER (WOODBRIDGE, VA) AND WHILE POLITE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HELP ME.  SO, I DECIDED TO CALL THE GM HELP PHONE NUMBER ON AUGUST 24, 2015 AND ASKED IF GM WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY BACK THE SUBJECT VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY I WILL HAVE TO SELL TO A PRIVATE PARTY A VEHICLE WITH TWO OUTSTANDING SAFETY RECALLS. SO, FAR GM HAS NOT BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MY REQUEST AND I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED BY THIS FOOT-DRAGGING BY GM FOR OUR PONTIAC VIBE.  IN TALKING TO THE LOCAL GM DEALER, HE SAID THAT THEY HAD CORRECTED THE SAME RECALL BUT ON A DIFFERENT VEHICLE.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT GM MAY BE DRAGGING IT HEALS ON A MAKE (PONTIAC) AND MODEL (VIBE) THAT IS NO LONGER  BEING MADE.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HAVE GM CORRECT THIS RECALL IMMEDIATELY OR BUY BACK MY VEHICLE AT A MORE THAN FAIR PRICE (FOR THEIR FOOT DRAGGING), I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

THE PURPOSE OF NOTICE WAS PURE PR, TO DUPE CONSUMERS INTO THINKING GM IS ON TOP OF THE RECALL. I CALLED MY LOCAL GM DEALER (REGAL GMC, LAKELAND, FL) ON 10/24. I WAS ADVISED THAT GM HADN'T EVEN SUPPLIED THE DEALERS WITH A GM RECALL NUMBER YET. THE DEALER PROMISED TO CALL ME WHEN THEY HAD MORE INFO. THAT NEVER HAPPENED. SO I CALLED THE DEALER TODAY (11/12/14) AND WAS ADVISED THAT PARTS ARE ON ORDER BUT THE DEALER (1) DOESN'T KNOW WHEN PARTS WILL BE RECEIVED AND (2) CANNOT PREDICT WHEN MY CAR WILL BE REPAIRED.  MEANWHILE, I HAVE A POTENTIALLY LETHAL PROBLEM WITH MY VEHICLE. IT'S OBVIOUS GM DOESN'T CARE MUCH. NHTSA MUST MAKE GM MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS SCREW-UPS AND FIX RECALLS IN A MUCH MORE TIMELY FASHION.

THE ADULT WITNESSES ALL COMMENDED  OUR SON ON HIS DRIVING ABILITY AS HE AVOIDED HITTING OTHER CARS. A DRIVER IN THE HUMMER BEHIND HIM ASSURED US THAT \"SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE CAR -  NOT HIS FAULT -TOO SUDDEN - MIRACLE HE DIDN'T ROLL .\" THE HUMMER DRIVER HAD BEEN BEHIND OUR SON FOR SOME TIME.

I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. THEY STATE THEY HAD TRIED TO REPRODUCE IT BUT EVERYTHING WORKED FINE. I THOUGHT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SO I CONTINUED TO USE THE CAR BUT HAVE NEVER USED THE CRUISE SINCE AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTY UNTIL RECENTLY. ON WED, 11/15/09, I WAS IN A PARKING LOT AND STEPPED ON THE BRAKES TO LET A CAR PASS IN FRONT OF ME. IMMEDIATELY WHEN I HIT THE BRAKES, THE CAR ACCELERATED. TO TRY AND STOP IT I INITIALLY TRIED TO PUSH AS HARD AS I COULD ON THE BRAKE BUT THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE. I THEN STARTED TO SHIFT IT INTO NEUTRAL AND LET UP ON THE BRAKES. THE CAR STOPPED AS SOON AS I LET UP ON THE BRAKES BUT ONLY AFTER I HAD TRAVELED ~20 FEET UP AN EMBANKMENT. I AGAIN BROUGHT IT IN TO THE DEALER WHO COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND COULD NOT GUARANTEE IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. I WILL NOT DRIVE IT AS I AM NOW SCARED OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS. *TR",

CUSTOMER SERVICE, AT ELHART, FOUND THAT A CLIP OR A BEARING HAD COME LOOSE AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE.  THIS IS NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN ON VEHICLES WITH 78,000 MILES ON THEM.     WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WOULD HAVE A THREE WAY CONVERSATION WITH GM, ELHART AND OURSELVES TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DISCOVERED AND SEE IF WE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE. THIS CONVERSATION NEVER HAPPENED.  WE SIMPLY RECEIVED A PHONE CALL SAYING THAT WE WERE DENIED OF ANY ASSISTANCE.
