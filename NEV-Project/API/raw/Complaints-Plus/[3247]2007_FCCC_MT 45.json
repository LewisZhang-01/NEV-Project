IN CT THE AXLE BROKE ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE WHEEL SHOT ACROSS 6 LANES OF HIGHWAY. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT AND NO OTHER CARS WERE INVOLVED. IT'S TRUE THAT THE ROADS ARE NOT IN THE BEST OF CONDITIONS BUT THE TRAILER SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE CONDITIONS OF I95. THE MANUFACTURER DID SEND US ANOTHER AXLE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED ON BUT REFUSES TO PAY THE REPAIR AND THE LODGING COST. IT TOOK 9 DAYS TO RECEIVE THE AXLE AND HOTELS AVERAGE $100. THE NEW AXLE DID FARE BETTER BUT HAS AN INADEQUATE SUSPENSION AND THE WHOLE TRAILER FRAME IS BENT AS WELL AS THE WALL FROM THE ACCIDENT. THE MANAGER FROM COVENANT CARGO REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE ME OTHER THAN THE AXLE HE SENT. THE VEHICLE INFO IN YOUR DROP DOWN MENU IS INACCURATE BUT I COULDN'T FIND COVENANT CARGO IN THE CHOICES SO I PICKED IT RANDOMLY.  *TR",
