The passenger side wiper arm over-traveled and jammed behind the driver side wiper arm leaving us with no windshield wipers. We pulled onto the shoulder and unjammed the wipers several times but each time they jammed again within a few minutes. We drove without wipers to the nearest exit where we spent the night on the side of the road. The next morning after the rain stopped we drove to an independent RV repair shop where the technician: \"Inspected all linkages, pivot points and mounting points. Found motor linkage bent. Straightened bracket and tightened passenger side spline mount.\" The next time we drove in the rain, on December 29, 2021, the same thing happened  after using the wipers for less than an hour. We exited the highway and drove on a secondary road to our destination in the rain without wipers. We cannot drive the vehicle in the rain in this condition again. We will contact a Thor authorized service center to arrange an inspection and repair.",
