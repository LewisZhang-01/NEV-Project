TO SAY THAT THESE BRAKE LINE FAILURES COULD BE AVOIDED THROUGH ROUTINE MAINTENANCE IS A BRAZEN ATTEMPT TO DEFLECT CULPABILITY TOWARDS A CONSUMER MARKET NEITHER DESIGNED NOR EQUIPPED TO DIAGNOSE PENDING FAILURE WITHOUT WARNING.

THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WITH ABOUT 76,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND APPLIED THE BRAKES AS I APPROACHED THE EXIT RAMP AND THE PEDAL WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT THE VEHICLE STOPPING. WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR I DRIFTED PAST THE EXIT AND APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER 1 MILE BEFORE FINALLY COMING TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER. AFTER GETTING THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL MECHANIC, THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE REAR BRAKE LINES RUSTED THROUGH AND THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM THEY SEE ON GM VEHICLES. THEY WERE SURPRISED I WAS NOT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND I PAID $500 TO HAVE THE REPLACEMENT LINES FABRICATED.  ABOUT A YEAR LATER WITH ABOUT 85,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING MY CHILDREN ACROSS A BRIDGE AND ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE AND AGAIN THE PEDAL WENT STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR NOT STOPPING THE VEHICLE AND SHE HELD DOWN THE HORN TO WARN PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER CARS. THE VEHICLE FINALLY STOPPED AFTER RUNNING 2 RED LIGHTS. THE MECHANIC INDICATED THAT ALL THE LINES COMING OUT OF THE MASTER CYLINDER/BOOSTER WERE RUSTED THROUGH AND BRAKE FLUID WAS POURING OUT. AGAIN HAVING TO FABRICATE AND REPLACE ALL THE LINES OUT OF THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS EXPENSIVE, THIS TIME COSTING $1,500.  THE NHTSA NEEDS TO DO A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THIS PROBLEM AS I HAVE HEARD MANY TIMES THAT THIS IS A FAULTY DESIGN AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS REQUIRING A RECALL. I TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CARS, HAVE THE UNDERCARRIAGE CLEANED FREQUENTLY AND ASK MY MECHANIC TO INSPECT EVERYTHING ON THE CAR ON A BI-ANNUAL BASIS AND THESE INCIDENTS HAPPEN WITHOUT WARNING.

THANKFULLY, SHE WAS ABLE TO COAST THE VEHICLE UP THE NEXT HILL AND BRING IT TO A STOP.  INSPECTION REVEALED BRAKE FLUID HAD LEAKED FROM A HIGHLY CORRODED BRAKE LINE ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE, BELOW THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  THREE OTHER ADJACENT BRAKE LINES WERE ALSO SIMILARLY CORRODED.  UPON CONTACTING THE NEAREST GM DEALER (TOM GILL CHEVROLET, FLORENCE, KY), THE SERVICE AGENT INFORMED ME \"THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN A 9-YEAR OLD VEHICLE.\"  FOUR ALMOST COMPLETELY RUSTED BRAKE LINES, IN JUST 8 YEARS?  THAT RIDICULOUS!  I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD TOYOTA IN THE DRIVEWAY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND I SHOULDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE IT WITH MY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND FAR NEWER AMERICAN MADE SUV.  TOM GILL SERVICE REFUSED TO GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF REPAIR, STATING I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IT TOWED THE 17 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP, WITH A \"WE'RE COMPETITIVE--WE'LL GIVE YOU A COMPETITIVE PRICE.\"  COMFORTING.  A FEW MORE CALLS TO LOCAL SHOPS REVEALED AN ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN $850-1,100 FOR REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF ALL FOUR LINES.   I ENDED-UP SPENDING 22 HOURS PULLING-OUT THE OLD LINES AND BENDING/FLARING/INSTALLING ENTIRELY NEW FRONT LINES MYSELF. LAST WEEK I LEARNED I'M NOT ALONE--A WCPO NEWS REPORT REVEALED THIS IS PROBLEMATIC WITH GM TRUCKS/SUVS, WITH GM DEFLECTING BLAME TO \"SALT BRINE.\"  AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS, AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS ARE STILL TAKING SHORTCUTS AND CANNING ETHICS...TOYOTA WILL CONTINUE TO WIN MARKET SHARE AS LONG AS THIS CRAP CONTINUES.  I'M ANGRY BECAUSE IT'S PUTTING OUR FAMILIES AT RISK.  NO ONE GOT HURT THIS TIME, AT LEAST NOT IN MY FAMILY, BUT THE POTENTIAL IS CERTAINLY THERE.  I THINK GM SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, AND I AM HOLDING ONTO THE CORRODED BRAKE LINES AS EVIDENCE IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE RECALL.  I'D ALSO LIKE THOSE 22 HOURS BACK. *TR",

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDOMETER ARE THE LIGHTS THAT INDICATE THE POSITION OF THE SHIFTER (PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, OVERDRIVE, AND GEARS 3,2 AND 1) AND ALSO THE ODOMETER READING. THESE INDICATOR LIGHTS WORKED FINE DURING THE TEST DRIVE BUT BECAME INTERMITTENT ON THE DRIVE HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE SINCE THEN. YOU LOSE ALL INDICATION OF WHAT GEAR YOU ARE IN AND OF THE ODOMETER READING. THIS PROBLEM COULD LEAD TO A DRIVER SHIFTING GEARS IMPROPERLY AND UNSAFELY, SUCH AS SHIFTING INTO A FORWARD GEAR IN A PARKING LOT WHEN THE REVERSE GEAR IS INTENDED OR SHIFTING INTO REVERSE WHILE DRIVING AND SEEKING OVERDRIVE AFTER BEING IN A LOWER GEAR. I HAVE NOW BEEN TOLD BY A FEW DEALERS THAT INSTRUMENT CLUSTER FAILURES ARE SOMEWHAT COMMON IN YUKON XLS AND ARE COSTING AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $700 TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER WHEN ONLY A SINGLE GAUGE IS HAVING AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. SINCE THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE COMMON AND CAN EFFECT SAFETY, AS IN THE EXAMPLES I GAVE ABOVE, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM AND SEE IF A RECALL/MANUFACTURER FIX IS WARRANTED. I JUST INVESTIGATED DRIVER COMPLAINTS AROUND THE INTERNET AND FOUND SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT YUKON XL SPEEDOMETER FAILURE/INTERMITTENT, FOR INSTANCE. IF A DRIVER DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SPEED HE IS TRAVELING AT HE IS A LESS SAFE DRIVER AND A POTENTIAL HAZARD TO OTHERS. EXCESSIVELY SLOW DRIVERS AND EXCESSIVELY FAST DRIVERS CAN BOTH CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN TRAFFIC, AND IN RURAL AREAS THERE MAY BE FEWER, IF ANY, DRIVERS ALONGSIDE TO HELP GAUGE THE NORMAL SPEED THAT IS APPROPRIATE. ALSO A VEHICLE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY FAIL OR STALL IN TRAFFIC, CAUSING AN ACCIDENT, IF A DRIVER IS UNAWARE OF AN EXTREMELY LOW BATTERY OR LOW FUEL, ETC. INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR SAFETY IN MANY WAYS. PLEASE INVESTIGATE PROBLEMS WITH INTERMITTENT AND FAILURES IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS USED IN 2002 GMC YUKON XLS.

ON OCCASION, THE STEERING WHEEL HAD EXCESSIVE PLAY IN THE WHEEL AND WOULD HESITATE WHEN TURNING.  SUSS PONTIAC VERIFIED THE COMPLAINT AND FOUND THE \"INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT\" DRY AND CLUNKING.  THE SHAFT WAS THEN LUBED AS PER BULLETIN #II-00-02-35-003B AND WE WERE TOLD AT THE TIME THAT THE PROBLEM SHOULD NOT REOCCUR.    THE PROBLEM RECURRED DURING THE FALL OF 2005 WHILE VACATIONING IN TEXAS.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE INCIDENT OVER THE PHONE WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN, MORE OF AN IRRITATION TO THOSE INSIDE THE VEHICLE AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING HOME.  WE MADE IT BACK TO DENVER WITHOUT INCIDENT, BUT VERY ANNOYING.  ON 10/25/05, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP (LEN LYALL OF AURORA, CO) ONLY TO LEARN THAT A NEW BULLETIN (# UNKWN) HAD BEEN ISSUED REQUIRING THAT THE \"INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT\" BE REPLACED.  LEN LYALL THEN PULLED A VEHICLE SERVICE INQUIRY LISTING ALL SERVICES PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, IT WAS NOTED IN THE SUMMARY THAT THE SHAFT HAD BEEN REPLACED, BUT MY COPY OF THE INVOICE REFERRED TO THE SHAFT BEING LUBED.    I AM NOW TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT GMC FOUND IT NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE SHAFT AND STILL TELLING ME THAT IT IS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN.

ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE LEAKAGE OF FUEL IN OUR GARAGES IS IGNITED WITH A WATER HEATER COMING ON WHILE WE ARE SLEEPING?  THIS PROBLEM MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. I PURCHASED ANOTHER IDENTICAL YUKON XL WITH MY DAUGHTER FROM THIS SAME DEALER. THIS VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE AT THE DEALERS LOCATION WAITING FOR A REPLACEMENT GAS TANK.    *LA",

I TOOK MY TRUCK INTO THE DEALER BECAUSE WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE RADIO WENT OUT.  I ASSUMED THAT MAYBE A FUSE HAD WENT OUT.  BUT WHEN ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO REPLACE THE BLOWN FUSE, THOSE FUSES BLEW ALSO.  AFTER TAKING IT TO THE DEALER, I WAS INFORMED THAT A SHORTING OF THE WIRING OCCURRED BECAUSE SODA WAS SPILLED IN THE REAR CUP HOLDER.  THIS CAUSED THE RADIO, SPEEDOMETER, HEAT, ETC... TO GO OUT ON THE FRONT DASH PANEL IN ADDITION TO MAKING SOMETHINGS COME ON WHEN THEY WERE IN THE OFF POSITION.  BECAUSE OF THE SPILLAGE CLAIM FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THIS I WAS TOLD WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY.  MY PROBLEM IS THIS, IF A LEAKAGE FROM A CUP-HOLDER CAN CAUSE SO MUCH DAMAGE, SHOULD THOSE WIRES BE SO EASILY EXPOSED?  SHOULDN'T THERE BE SOME TYPE OF SAFETY MECHINISM IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING.  THIS VEHICLE IS PROMOTED AS A FAMILY CAR, BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE SAFE FOR A FAMILY.  IF THE WIRES ARE SO CLOSE TO THE SURFACE UNPROTECTED THAT SODA COULD GO INTO IT FROM A CUP HOLDER, WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE CHILD HAND.  I HAVE A TWENTY MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WHO RIDES IN A CAR SEAT IN THE REAR, SHE OFTEN DRINKS FROM A SIP-IT-CUP WHILE BACK THERE.  SIP-IT-CUP RARELY LEAK, SO HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AN AMOUNT GREAT ENOUGH TO CAUSE THIS MUCH DAMAGE COULD OCCUR? SOME SORT OF SAFETY MECHANISM NEEDS TO BE INSTALL TO PREVENT CONTACT WITH THESE WIRES.  THESE WIRES CAUSE QUITE A BIT OF SYSTEMS TO FAIL ON THE VEHICLE.  WHAT'S NEXT ?   I HATE TO IMAGINE THAT IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN THAT MAYBE IT WON'T BE THE RADIO THAT GOES OUT MAYBE IT WILL BE A FIRE THAT STARTS OR MAYBE THE ENTIRE CAR MIGHT EXPLODE.

BOTH THE FRONT AND BACK TIRES HAD THE SAME TIRE WEAR SINCE THEY HAD BEEN ROTATED AT 5000 MILES.

SECOND OPINIONS WERE SOUGHT FROM DIFFERENT TIRE DEALERSHIPS IN THE TEMECULA AREA, WITH ALL STATING THAT IT IS NOT NORMAL.  MY CONCERN IS FOR MY WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN, AS MY SPOUSE IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS VEHICLE.  THE VEHILCE HANDLES VERY POORLY ON THE FREEWAY AND MOST RECENTLY, HAVING RECEIVED SOME RAIN IN OUR LOCAL AREA, I WAS ALARMED AT HOW POORLY THE VEHILCLE HANDLED ON THE WET ROADS.
