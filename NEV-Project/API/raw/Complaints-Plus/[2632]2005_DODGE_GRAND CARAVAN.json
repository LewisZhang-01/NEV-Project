IT WAS STOP AND GO RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, SO I WAS THANKFULLY ONLY GOING APPROX 15-20 MILES AN HOUR.  POWER STEERING WAS LOST, BRAKES WERE PRACTICALLY NON EXISTENT.

I PHYSICALLY CANNOT LOCK THE PASSENGER DOORS MYSELF, WHEN DRIVING. I EITHER HAVE TO REMEMBER TO DO IT BEFORE I LEAVE, MAKE SURE THE PERSON THAT GETS OUT DOES IT BEFORE THEY LEAVE, PULL OVER TO LOCK THEM, OR DRIVE WITH THEM UNLOCKED. THAT'S NOT SAFE!

NOW, BOTH HAVE TO BE MANUALLY UNLOCKED AND ON OCCASION THE RIGHT SIDE WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY AFTER YOU MANUALLY UNLOCK IT. NEITHER OF THE REAR SLIDING DOORS LOCK OR UNLOCK AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE BUTTON ON THE HEADLINER, THE AUTOMATIC BUTTON ON THE DOOR, OR WITH THE KEY.  THE LEFT DOOR DOES NOT EVEN WANT TO OPEN MANUALLY FROM THE INSIDE.  THIS GETS SCARY WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY SEAT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND OTHERS HAVE LEFT THE VEHICLE BEFORE YOU AND YOU HAVE NO ONE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND ARE UNABLE TO CLIMB OVER THE FRONT SEATS DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES.   WHEN WE BOUGHT THE VAN WE WERE SHOWN AT THE DEALER HOW THE DOORS WOULD STOP IF THERE WAS A HAND, FOOT, OR SOMETHING IN THE DOORWAY TO AVOID INJURY, SO COULD THE MECHANICALS THAT WORK THIS BE AT FAULT??  WE NEVER WANTED TO TRY THIS TO SEE, BUT THIS IS ABOUT WHERE THE DOOR STOPS WORKING ON THE LEFT SIDE.  I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE MANY, MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE DOORS NOT WORKING.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS WHY THIS ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY CHRYSLER. TO BE HONEST WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH THIS VAN SINCE WE BOUGHT IT AND SPOKE TO LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS.  WE FEEL THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL.  *TR",

I GOOGLED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS PEOPLE WITH THIS 4TH GENERATION CARAVAN THAT HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  DODGE'S MEDIATOR SUGGESTED THAT IT'S A PROBLEM WITH TOPPING OFF THE TANK, BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT NOT TOPPING IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE ONLINE STRINGS I AM ATTACHING, THERE ARE OTHERS WHO NEVER TOP OFF THEIR TANK AND HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS WE DO.  THIS IS APPARENTLY A DESIGN FLAW THAT CREATES A DANGER.  IT IS EXPENSIVE FOR THE CONSUMER TO FIX, AND MY IMPRESSION IS THAT IT WILL STEADILY GET WORSE.

I READ MANY FORUMS ONLINE ABOUT HAVING THE DEALER REPROGRAM THE BCM AND SOME PEOPLE FOUND SUCCESS WITH THIS FOR AROUND $100. I TOOK MY VAN TO A DODGE DEALER WHO TOLD ME THEY NEVER HEARD OF THAT FIX FOR THE DOOR LOCKS. SO I WOUND UP SPENDING OVER $1100 TO HAVE A LATCH AND 2 POWER ACTUATORS REPLACED. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM FEELING VERY RIPPED OFF.  WITH SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH THIS IDENTICAL COMPLAINT, YOU WOULD THINK DODGE WOULD ISSUE A RECALL. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE. *JB",

THERE WAS NO DEBRIS IN THE ROAD, I DID NOT RUN OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING. WHEN I PULLED INTO MY GARAGE AND TURNED THE CAR OFF, I HEARD A HISSING NOISE AND FOUND THAT MY TIRE WAS RAPIDLY GOING FLAT. MY HUSBAND TOOK THE TIRE OFF AND FOUND THAT THE INSIDE SIDEWALL ON THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE WAS SPLIT IN THREE PLACES. HE PUT THE SPARE TIRE ON SO THAT I COULD GO TO DUNCAN'S AUTO REPAIR IMMEDIATELY THE NEXT MORNING. I DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH PRIOR TO TAKING THE TIRE TO THE SHOP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED AND SAW MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS FOR SIDEWALL SPLITS IN GOODYEAR INTEGRITY TIRES. I HAVE THREE OTHER GOODYEAR INTEGRITY TIRES ON MY CAR, ALL LESS THAN A YEAR OLD. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SIMILAR INCIDENTS.

THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS DECEMBER 20, 2006 AND THE PASSENGER DOOR GLASS SHATTERED.  BOTH TIMES WHILE DRIVING FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  I CALLED CHRYSLER WHO SAID THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS AND OFFERED 2 REASONS, 1) SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE (NEITHER TIME WAS THERE A DRASTIC CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE) AND THE SECOND REASON GIVEN WAS POSSIBLY A SCRATCH ON THE GLASS IF I HAD SCRAPPED THEM FOR SOME REASON.  THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT MY VAN WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I KNEW THAT AND GLASS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ANY WAY.  IT SEEMS MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE THAT 2 SEPARATE PIECES OF ORIGINAL FACTORY GLASS ON SEPARATE DOORS WOULD SHATTER IN THIS WAY.  I ALWAYS USE THE AUTOMATIC OPENER AND CLOSER AND VERY RARELY IS THE DOOR MANUALLY OPENED OR CLOSED (EITHER DOORS).  IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS THIS VEHICLE IS PURCHASED BY MANY PEOPLE WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE FAMILIES AND CARRY CHILDREN.  WHEN THE GLASS SHATTERS AND YOU NEED TO CONTINUE DRIVING UNTIL YOU CAN GET THE GLASS SECURED PEOPLE OR CHILDREN THAT MAY BE INSIDE WILL HAVE GLASS ALL OVER THEM.  IN SHORT CHRYSLER REFUSED TO PAY FOR ANY REPLACEMENT GLASS OR ACKNOWLEDGE IT COULD BE AN ISSUE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS NOT BEING INVESTIGATED BY CHRYSLER/DODGE FOR A POSSIBLE DESIGN FLAW EITHER OR DEFECT IN GLASS.   *TR",

I TRIED DOING ABOUT 30 TURNS THOUGH TO NO EFFECT. THE MECHANISM IN THE FLOOR WAS TURNING WITH ALOT OF EFFORT BUT THE TIRE WAS NOT BEING LOWERED. THIS WAS ON A COLD SNOWY DAY AND I WAS ON A SIDE ROAD WITH LITTLE ROOM TO LAY DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT AND REACH UNDER TRYING TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG. I SPENT 3 HOURS WAITING FOR AAA AND THEN GAVE UP AND TOOK THE DAMAGED TIRE TO A WALMART LEAVING MY WIFE IN THE CAR ON THE JACK - MY ONLY CHOICE.

SO IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN A TIRE CENTER NEARBY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY STUCK WITH NO WAY TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. MY MECHANIC TELLS ME THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN - THERE WAS ICE ALL OVER THE RELEASE MECHANISM AND IT WAS BROKEN. HE SAID HE SEES THIS ALOT ON FAIRLY NEW CARS LIKE MINE.

THIS IS A HORRIBLE, DANGEROUS DESIGN AND I THINK THESE CARS SHOULD BE RECALLED AND A DIFFERENT SYSTEM DEVELOPED.

WE ALSO REPLACED THE RACK AND PINION UNIT (UNDER WARRANTY).  JUST 18 MONTHS LATER THE RACK AND PINION UNIT WAS BAD AGAIN. SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, WE SPENT $1,129 TO FIX IT.  IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT THIS PART WENT BAD AGAIN SO SOON.  DO WE HAVE TO SPEND $1000 EVERY YEAR TO REPLACE THIS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE PART?      THE DODGE DEALER MY HUSBAND WORKED WITH INFORMED HIM THAT THE RACK AND PINION UNIT NOW COMES WITH A COOLER TO HELP WITH THIS ISSUE, SO OBVIOUSLY DODGE IS AWARE THAT THIS PART IS DEFECTIVE AND HAS A SHORT LIFESPAN.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, WHY WASN'T A RECALL SENT OUT TO ADD THE COOLER TO THIS UNIT.    I'M VERY DISSATISFIED WITH OUR DODGE VAN AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER PURCHASE FROM DODGE/CHRYSLER/JEEP AGAIN!  SHOULDN'T A RECENTLY INSTALLED PART LAST LONGER THAN 18 MONTHS?  ISN'T THAT REASONABLE?  WE'VE GONE THROUGH TWO RACK AND PINION UNITS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR A 2005 VEHICLE ' THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

THE POWER STEERING RACK WAS DIAGNOSED AS LEAKING DUE TO BAD SEALS AND THE UNIT WAS REPLACED. THE POWER STEERING RESERVOIR WAS ALSO REPLACED BECAUSE OF A RESTRICTION OF FLOW. ACCORDING TO DIALOGUE WITH THE DEALERSHIP, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SCREEN IN THE RESERVOIR WAS PLUGGED, WHICH CAUSED THE SQUEAKING SOUND I WAS HEARING. I BELIEVE THE SCREEN WAS PLUGGED WITH DEBRIS GENERATED BY THE FAILING SEALS IN THE POWER STEERING RACK, SINCE THIS IS A RECIRCULATION HYDRAULIC SYSTEM.  THE MILEAGE AT THE TIME OF FAILURE WAS 38,256 MILES, AND I BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF FAILURE WAS PREMATURE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE FAILURE COULD HAVE HAD SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES HAD I INDEED LOST ALL THE FLUID FROM THE SYSTEM PRIOR TO MY DISCOVERY OF THE PROBLEM. I HAD THE POWER STEERING RACK REPLACED ON MY 2001 DODGE CARAVAN THIS YEAR, BUT THE MILEAGE WAS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER, AROUND 80,000 MILES.  NEITHER THE PREVIOUS OWNER NOR I INFLUENCED THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING RACK, NOR THE PLUGGED SCREEN IN THE RESERVOIR; EVEN THOUGH THE MECHANICS ATTEMPTED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON ME STATING THAT THE RESERVOIR FAILURE WAS DUE TO IMPROPER MAINTENANCE.

WE ARE GETTING THE RUN AROUND ON THE PHONE AND CHRYSLER WILL NOT DISCUSS IT WITH US NOW. ALL I WAS ASKING WAS FOR THEM TO RECALL THIS FEATURE AND MAKE IT DEPLOY TO CAUSE LESS INJURY AND OR DISABLE IT ON OUR VAN.  THANK YOU  JIMMY SUTHERLAND    MY WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT IN OUR 2005 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN, ALL THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED AND I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THE VEHICLE PERFORMED WITH EXCEPTION TO THE DRIVERS KNEE AIRBAG. THIS AIRBAG IS LOCATED UNDER THE STEERING COLUMN AND BEHIND BOTH A METAL AND PLASTIC DASHPLATE, WHEN DEPLOYED THESE DASHPLATES WERE FORCED INTO MY WIFE'S LOWER LEGS CAUSING INJURIES FROM THE KNEES DOWN. NO OTHER INJURIES WERE SUFFERED BY ANYONE IN EITHER VEHICLE OTHER THAN THESE LEG INJURIES. THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THIS AIR BAG WASN'T THERE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD NO INJURIES EITHER.
