I DID AND SPOKE WITH LAUREN WHO WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND TOOK INFO FROM ME BUT HAD NO RESOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THE DEALERSHIP WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME A PRICE ON REPAIRING IT.  THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED ME AND SAID IT WOULD BE BETWEEN $300 AND $500 DEPENDING ON WHAT WAS WRONG TO FIX IT.

I AM FINANCIALLY STRAPPED, OR CHECK TO CHECK AS MOST SAY AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO GET IT FIXED AND DIDN'T SEE A NEED TO IF IT WASN'T MY FAULT. AS I SAID, WHY SPEND MY MONEY WHEN TOYOTA WONT ADMIT TO ANYTHING. I WOKE UP TO FIND THIS CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD ON A VERY MILD TEMP. DAY OF ABOUT 70 I BELIEVE. NEITHER HOT NOR COLD. I REMEMBER VIVIDLY. I GOT IN MY CAR TO GO TO WORK AND NOTICED THIS L-SHAPED CRACK STARTING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE CURVING DOWN AND GOING TOWARD THE DRIVER'S SIDE. I DROVE ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER AFTER HAVING THE CAR LOOKED AT IN TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, ON A 5 HOURS TRIP AND ANOTHER CRACK STARTED APPEARING FROM THE BOTTOM MIDLINE.... AND PROGRESSED UPWARD AND LEFT TOWARD THE DRIVER SIDE, AND BY THE END OF THE TRIP IT WAS OVER A FOOT IN LENGTH. APPEARING TO BE STRESS FROM AN 80 MPH SPEED MAJORITY OF THE TRIP. I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA ABOUT IT MANY TIMES AND NEVER ONCE WAS IT THEIR FAULT. I JUST RECENTLY GO ONLINE AFTER SEEING MY 5TH 2006 XB CRACKED WINDSHIELD IDENTICAL TO MINE.

JUST IN CASE I WAS HEARING THINGS, I HAD MY HUSBAND RIDE ALONG & HE HEARD THE SAME NOISES. A WEEK OR TWO LATER, I NOTICED THAT WHEN THE WS WAS FOGGING THERE WERE STREAM LINES FROM WATER ON THE LEFT INSIDE AND I KNEW THOSE SHOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE THE LAST CO. HAD PUT IN A BRAND NEW WS. LATER, I FINALLY NOTICED WATER DRIPPING IN THE SAME SPOT & I KNEW IT WAS LEAKING AGAIN.

THE FOLLOWING MONDAY (TODAY) I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP. I'M TAKING THE CAR IN TONIGHT. I'M SUGGESTING, SOME SORT OF EXTRA STRENGTH SEAL & POSSIBLY A SWAY BAR TO STABILIZE THE VEHICLE MORE. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK THEN I WANT TO TRADE IT IN FOR A NEWER XB OR POSSIBLY SOMETHING ELSE.

THE FIRST OCCURRED THE 2ND WEEK OF HAVING MY CAR. A ROCK HIT THE WINDSHIELD IN THE MIDDLE AND CAUSED A CHIP, I IMMEDIATELY HAD NOVUS STOP IT BEFORE IT TURNED INTO A BIGGER PROBLEM. I HAD NO PROBLEMS THROUGH THE SUMMER AND LIVED WITH A CHIP WINDSHIELD. THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ANOTHER ROCK HIT THE EDGE OF MY WINDSHIELD (WHERE THE FRAME OF THE CAR IS BEHIND THE GLASS) AND THE CRACK IMMEDIATELY SPREAD TO BEING ABOUT 12 INCHES LONG. I PLACED A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND HAD THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED WITH TOYOTA MANUFACTURED GLASS ABOUT A WEEK LATER. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED AGAIN, WITH NO CAUSE OR ROCK DAMAGE NOTICED. THE CRACK GREW QUICKLY AND IS ABOUT 15 INCHES LONG. I CALLED THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE PEOPLE WHO REPLACED MY WINDSHIELD. I ALSO DID A BIT OF RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THE WINDSHIELD IS APPARENTLY CURSED BECAUSE OWNERS EVERYWHERE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. AND NOW I HAVE A SECOND 15 INCH CRACK ON THE SAME WINDSHIELD. I'M WAITING FOR THE ORIGINAL TOYOTA MANUFACTURED GLASS TO COME IN (SO THAT TOYOTA IS STILL RESPONSIBLE WHEN I HAVE TO REPLACE IT A THIRD TIME) AND THEN I'LL HAVE IT REPLACED. 4 CRACKS IN LESS THAN A YEAR... SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS WINDSHIELD.  *TR",
