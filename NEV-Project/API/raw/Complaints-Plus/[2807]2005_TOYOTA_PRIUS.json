The brake system failed and the vehicle was super hard to stop! Came very close to having a major accident on the interstate when this happened!!! It took pumping of the brakes and full force on the pedal to bring it to a stop!! Went back to the shop and was told that the ABS control module/actuator went bad and needs to be replaced.

A FEW MILES LATER I PULLED INTO A REST AREA AND TURNED OFF THE CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, AND WHEN I GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND TURNED ON THE HEADLIGHTS THEY BOTH CAME ON, BUT WITHIN 20 SECONDS THE PASSENGER SIDE LIGHT WENT OUT AGAIN.   WHEN I GOT HOME THE NEXT DAY AND TURNED ON THE HEADLIGHTS THEY WERE BOTH WORKING AGAIN.    THIS INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT HAS OCCURRED A FEW TIMES IN THE PAST, AND I HAVE HAD THE TOYOTO DEALER LOOK INTO IT AND THEY CLAIMED THAT IT WAS FIXED.

I TELEPHONED TOYOTA AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT I WAS MISINFORMED BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND THAT THE PART WAS NOT RECALLED, BUT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ISSUED ON THE PART IN 2012. I ASKED WHY THE VEHICLE WAS NOT RECALLED AND WAS TOLD BECAUSE IT WASN'T A SAFET    MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE IF THIS PART FAILS. BY SURFING THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS BY OTHERS REGARDING THE SAME PROBLEM. IF MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE HOME, PARKED THE VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE AS SHE USUALLY DOES. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT HAVE TURNED OFF. THE VEHICLE IS A HYBRID AND WHEN THE BATTERY POWER WAS DEPLETED, THE GASOLINE ENGINE WOULD HAVE KICKED ON. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A DANGER, DUE TO CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING TO ANY OCCUPANTS WITHIN THE HOUSE. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM NO LONGER WORKS WHEN THIS PART FAILS, THE BRAKING DISTANCE INCREASES IN AN EMERGENCY BRAKING SITUATION. WHEN THIS PART FAILS THE DASH GOES COMPLETELY BLACK, THE DRIVER IS UNAWARE THAT THE ABS BRAKING SYSTEM IS NO LONGER WORKING. THE DRIVER IS ALSO UNABLE TO SEE THE SPEEDOMETER OR ANY OTHER GAUGES IN THE DASH.    DUE TO RECENT DEATHS, DUE TO CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING CAUSED BY VEHICLES NOT TURNING OFF. I FEEL THAT TOYOTA IS NEGLIGENT FOR NOT TAKING MY CONCERNS MORE SERIOUSLY. TOYOTA IS AWARE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS PART, THEY ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY IN 2012.",

I HAD TURN SIGNAL LIGHTS, BUT NOTHING ELSE UNLESS I TURNED OFF THE HEADLIGHTS.  THIS WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS I WAS DRIVING HOME AFTER DARK.  I HAD NO IDEA HOW FAST I WAS GOING, WHAT GEAR I WAS IN, IF I HAD ENOUGH GAS TO GET HOME, ETC., ETC. THE NEXT MORNING I TOOK A 20-MILE DRIVE AND WHEN I STOPPED, I COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO SHUT OFF BY PUSHING THE IGNITION BUTTON.  I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE ENGINE FINALLY TURNED OFF, BUT THE DISPLAY PANEL WAS STILL DIMLY LIT. I THEN DROVE DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE WHATEVER WAS WRONG REPAIRED.  AFTER A MECHANIC CHECKED IT OUT, IT WAS DETERMINED THE COMPUTER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART.  THIS IS NOT AN ITEM THAT IS NORMALLY SERVICED AND I HAVE NO CLUE IF THE DEALERSHIP CHECKS IT DURING A SERVICING OF THE CAR. SO I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON IT.  IN CHECKING ON THIS WEBSITE I FIND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM AND THAT I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A RECALL ON IT. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR I ASKED ABOUT THE RECALL AND I WAS GIVEN PAPERWORK STATING IT WAS A \"WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM\" FOR \"9 YEARS WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITATION FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 30, 2013\". LETTERS WERE SENT OUT TO PRIUS OWNERS OF CARS FROM 2004 TO CERTAIN 2009 MODELS.  I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER AND AM VERY CONCERNED IF TOYOTA KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHY DIDN'T THEY NOT DO JUST A \"WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM\" BUT A RECALL? THEY WOULD THAT EVENTUALLY ALL CARS WOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT SHOULD BE REPLACED. THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE!",

I EXPERIENCED THE FAILURE AGAIN ON 11/18/2014.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE IT TO SUN TOYOTA.

I FOUND THAT IF I TURNED THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF THE HEADLIGHT WOULD COME BACK ON, I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.  TODAY I DECIDED TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, NOW THEY CAN'T SEEM TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM, ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS SELL ME A NEW BULB.    AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON MY OWN I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM SINCE 2007 AND THAT THE NHTSA HAS INVESTIGATED THIS AND HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DECISION WOULD LIKE TO GO ON A LONG NIGHT DRIVE WITH ME ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD.  RIGHT NOW I WANT TO OFFICIALLY FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, MY 2005 TOYOTA PRIUS IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT DEPENDABLE AND THERE IS NO TELLING WHEN THEY WILL STOP WORKING.  *TR",

THE PROBLEM BEGINS WITH THE SENSOR IN THE 2004 AND 2005 MODEL PRIUSES, WHERE A GASKET FAILS AND THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THE SENSOR CORRODE AND FAIL. TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND NOW OFFERS IMPROVED REPLACEMENT PARTS AND HAS ISSUED THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN BELOW. HOWEVER, REPLACING THIS PART AT A DEALER CAN COST UPWARDS OF $500, DISCOURAGING MANY OWNERS FROM MAKING THE REPAIR, LEADING TO UNSAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR PRIUS DRIVERS AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD. THERE IS NO MANUAL OVERRIDE TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR A DRIVER TO DRIVE IN THE DARK. IT SEEMS LIKE POOR ENGINEERING THAT TOYOTA HAS IMPLEMENTED A SAFETY DEVICE THAT, WHEN IT FAILS, CREATES A MORE UNSAFE CONDITION THAN IF THE SAFETY DEVICE WERE NOT THERE.

THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT WAS DECOUPLED FROM THE ELECTRIC- POWER- ASSIST COLUMN OUTPUT SPLINE. A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DECOUPLED COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY INSTALLED ON THE SPLINE OUTPUT OF THE POWER ASSIST COLUMN.  THIS ALLOWED A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ON THE INTERIOR OF THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWED SEPARATION OF THAT SHAFT FROM THE ELECTRICAL STEERING POWER ASSIST COLUMN.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE SHAFT SPLINE SHOWED A LONG TERM DETERIORATION OF THE UPPER INTERMEDIATE SHAFT #2 INSIDE SPLINE AS EVIDENCE BY METALLURGICAL SHARDS OF DETERIORATED SPLINE METAL STILL RESIDING IN THE UPPER INTERMEDIATE SHAFT CAVITY.

WHEN APPLYING BRAKES AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, JERKINESS FELT LIKE ALTERNATE OVER BRAKING / UNDER BRAKING.  SYMPTOMS WERE QUITE SCARY THE FIRST TIMES IT HAPPENED.    HAD PERSONAL MECHANIC CHECK OUT BRAKES.  TEST DRIVE CONFIRMED PROBLEM, BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH HYDRAULIC BRAKE SYSTEM.  SINCE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT, WE DECIDED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED.    PROBLEM CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY, GRADUALLY INCREASING IN FREQUENCY TO THE POINT IN THE LAST MONTH WHERE IT WAS HAPPENING MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.  TOOK CAR TO TOYOTA DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS.   PROBLEM WAS NOT EVIDENT ON DAY OF SERVICE.  THEY CHECKED COMPUTER FOR STORED ERROR CODES, AND FOUND NONE.  REAR BRAKE DRUMS SHOWED SLIGHT WEAR AND WERE OUT OF ADJUSTMENT, SO DRUMS WERE CLEANED AND TURNED AND BRAKES ADJUSTED.  NO DIFFERENCE IN OBSERVED BEHAVIOR; BY END OF THE NEXT DAY, JERKY BEHAVIOR NOTED AS BAD AS IT HAD EVER BEEN.    TOOK CAR BACK TO DEALER.  THEY REPLACED THE STROKE SENSOR EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO STORED ERROR CODE.  THIS APPEARS TO HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM, SINCE THERE HAS BEEN NO RECURRENCE OF PROBLEM IN A WEEK OR DRIVING SINCE REPAIR.  BRAKES FEEL TOTALLY NORMAL AGAIN, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR.    NOTE ON DIAGNOSIS PROCEDURE:  THE DEALER SEEMED TO INITIALLY DISCOUNT MY DETAILED, WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM, AND REACTED ONLY TO THEIR OBSERVATIONS.  WHILE UNDERSTANDABLE, IT IS FRUSTRATING TO THE OWNER AND COULD LEAD TO A SERIOUS PROBLEM NOT GETTING FIXED.  I FEEL THAT THE SYMPTOMS AS DESCRIBED TO THEM POINTED DIRECTLY TO THE STROKE SENSOR AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED ON THAT BASIS.  *TT",

TOYOTA USE TO BE GREAT ON SAFETY AND NOW THEY ARE REALLY BAD AND WON'T FESS UP TO ERRORS.  SEARCH TOYOTA AIRBAG DEFECTS AND SEE ALL THE OTHERS THAT HAVE HAD PROBLEMS.  SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO DIE PROBABLY HUNDREDS BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE.  *TR",

THIS SITUATION COULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECTIFIED BY QUICKLY TURNING OFF AND ON AGAIN THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH AT THE STEERING WHEEL STALK.  THEN, ON JULY 24, 2010, WHILE ON A REMOTE AND STEEP WINDING MOUNTAIN PASS ROAD IN CALIFORNIA, (SONORA PASS ROAD) IN PITCH DARK, BOTH HEADLAMPS FAILED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND COULD NOT BE RECTIFIED WITH A QUICK FLICK OF THE HEADLAMP SWITCH OFF AND ON.  I BRAKED HEAVILY, KEEPING IN MY MIND A VISION OF THE CURVE IN THE ROAD I HAD JUST SEEN AHEAD OF ME.  BRAKING HEAVILY AND TRYING TO STEER IN THE DARK, I PUT THE FLASHERS ON SO I WOULDN'T BE REAR-ENDED.  THIS ENDED UP BEING A FORTUITOUS DECISION, BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK THAT THE MOMENTARY FLASHES OF THE FORWARD FLASHERS ALLOWED ME TO SEE JUST ENOUGH ROAD IN BRIEF SNIPPETS SO THAT I COULD STEER MY VEHICLE SAFELY AROUND THE CURVE AND GET IT OFF THE ROAD.  I FIGURED OUT THAT WITH BOTH LAMPS OUT, A MUCH SLOWER OFF/ON AGAIN CYCLE OF THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH WOULD BRING THEM BACK ON, AND I LIMPED THE VEHICLE HOME. HAVING DRIVEN OVER A MILLION MILES IN MY ADULT LIFE, LUCKILY I HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND THE CALM TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION WITHOUT CATASTROPHIC RESULT.  HAD MY WIFE OR MY DAUGHTER BEEN DRIVING, WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE ROAD AND CRASHED THE VEHICLE.  IMMEDIATELY THE FOLLOWING DAY I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER; END RESULT OF WHICH THEY WANT ME TO PAY NEARLY $900 TO REPLACE THESE DEFECTIVE HEADLAMPS.  I CALLED TOYOTA, AND UPON INITIAL CONTACT, WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IN THIS ECONOMY, WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY, AND WE HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO DRIVING OUR PRIUS MOSTLY DAYTIMES, AND CERTAINLY NOT ON MOUNTAIN PASS ROADS AT NIGHT.

I RETURNED HOME TO CALL TOYOTA CORPORATION SAYING THAT I BOUGHT TWO PRIUS' MONTHS APART BUT THE SAME YEAR CAR, FROM TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS AND AM EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH BOTH CARS JUST A FEW WEEKS APART.  I MENTIONED MY CONCERN THAT THE CAR MIGHT SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL WHILE DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY CAUSING A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I ASKED IF OTHER DRIVERS HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND WHAT IF ANY ASSISTANCE THEY COULD GIVE.  THEY STATED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF THIS PROBLEM AND WILL NOT BE RECALLING THE CARS AT THIS TIME.  I AGAIN STRESSED MY SAFETY CONCERNS.  THEY AGAIN STATED THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE PLANS FOR RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE.  THE COST OF THE REPAIR IS CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.  MY SAFETY CONCERNS REMAIN AS FAR AS DRIVING THIS CAR FOR MYSELF AND OTHER DRIVERS WHO OWN A PRIUS.

THE OFFICER ARRIVED (CALLED BY THE METER PERSON) AND I GAVE MY REPORT. THE OFFICER ASKED ME IF I COULD DRIVE MY CAR HOME. I SAID I WASN'T SURE, I WOULD CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY. IN ANY CASE I WOULD NOT TRY TO DRIVE RIGHT AWAY AS I WAS TOO SHAKEN. THE OTHER DRIVER DROVE AWAY. WHEN THE OFFICER LEFT, I SAT IN MY CAR PASSENGER SIDE WITH MY FEET ON THE SIDEWALK STILL IN SHOCK. I WAS AFRAID OF DRIVING THE CAR. I CALLED MY SON TO COME TO GET ME. I CALLED THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND FOLLOWED THEIR DIRECTIONS.    INTENT ON STOPPING THE CAR, I HAD BRAKED AS HARD AS I COULD WITH MY LEFT FOOT.  WHEN WAITING TO TURN THE CAR AROUND I SAW THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS ON. *TR",

NUMEROUS WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AS I COASTED TO A STOP IN A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE CAR WOULD NOT SHUT OFF AT FIRST.  AFTER I FINALLY GOT THE CAR TO TURN OFF, IT WOULD NOT TURN ON AGAIN.  THE DISPLAY IN THE CENTER OF THE DASHBOARD WOULD COME ON FINE, BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE MAIN ENGINE TO TURN ON (WHEN PUSHING THE START BUTTON), IT WOULD BLINK AND SHUT OFF IMMEDIATELY.  WHEN I TOOK A LOOK UNDER THE HOOD, I COULD SMELL SOMETHING ELECTRICAL BURNING.      I FINALLY GOT THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL SHOP THAT WAS TOYOTA/LEXUS CERTIFIED.  THEY FIGURED OUT THAT THE INVERTER COOLING PUMP WAS DEFECTIVE AND IT WAS BLOWING FUSES (HENCE THE SMELL OF SOMETHING ELECTRICAL BURNING).  TOTAL COST WAS ALMOST $500 FOR THE REPAIR: PARTS AND LABOR.      I TRIED CALLING TOYOTA TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY TYPE OF REIMBURSEMENT, BUT I GOT MANY REASONS WHY I SHOULD NOT GET ONE:    - THE WARRANTY WAS FOR 60,000 OR 8 YEARS.  I WAS IN THE 8 YEARS, THE MILEAGE WAS 62,000.  (I GUESS CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT MEAN MUCH - PREVIOUSLY I OWN A 94 TOYOTA COROLLA - 16 YEARS WITH A TOYOTA CAR)  - I DID NOT GET IT REPAIRED AT A TOYOTA \"DEALERSHIP\"  (EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE \"TOYOTA\" CERTIFIED)  - I DID NOT BUY THE CAR NEW.  (SO IF YOU BUY A USED TOYOTA, APPARENTLY THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE CAR A TOYOTA ANYMORE.)     BOTTOM LINE, AFTER BEING FIXED THE CAR RUNS EVEN BETTER THEN BEFORE THE INVERTER COOLING PUMP FAILURE: BETTER GAS MILEAGE AND NO MORE PHANTOM STEERING WHEEL MOVEMENTS WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY (HAPPENED WHEN THE ENGINE WOULD SWITCH OVER TO BATTERY AND VICE VERSA).  *TR",

AND I HAD MY BLUE TOOTH EARPIECE ON. THEN ALL AT THE SAME TIME MY BLUE TOOTH SHUT DOWN. MY GPS SHUT DOWN. AND EVERY WARNING LITE CAME UP IN THE CAR. EVEN THE DISPLAY THAT USUALLY SHOWS HOW THE HYBRID SYSTEMS WORKS WAS BLINKING PROBLEM!! PROBLEM!! SO I LET OFF THE GAS AND STARTED TO MOVE TO THE RT SIDE OF THE ROAD. THATS WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD NO POWER STEERING. THERE WAS AN EXIT COMING UP SO I LET THE CAR SLOW DOWN TO ABOUT 50MPH. AS I STARTED TO EXIT I PUT MY FT ON THE BRAKES. THATS WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE PEDAL WAS VERY STIFF AND VIBRATING. I WAS COMING TO A BLIND INTERSECTION AND I HAD THE RED LITE. SO I PUSHED ON MY BRAKES. INSTANTLY I COULD HEAR SCREACHING TIRES. SO I LOOKED IN MY SIDE MIRROR. AND TO MY SUPRISE IM LOOKING AT A LARGE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM ME! MY REAR TIRES HAD LOCKED UP AND MY FRONT TIRES WERENT DOING ANYTHING. SO I STARTED FISHTAIL BACK AND FORTH LIKE I HAD MY EBRAKE ON. I PUT ALL MY WT ON THE PEDAL CAUSE THE INTERSECTION WAS REALLY GETTING CLOSE. AND WITHOUT POWER STEERING IT WAS VERY HARD TO KEEP THE CAR FROM CRASHING. I CAME TO A STOP JUST BEFORE THE LIGHT. THEN DROVE MY CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALER AT IN BERKELEY CA AT 10MPH. I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING. EVEN ABOUT MY BLUE TOOTH AND GARMIN. THEY GOT ME A RENTAL CAR THEN 4DAY LATER THEY SAID IF I GIVE THEM  $2000 FOR A PART AND $1000 IN LABOR IT MIGHT FIX IT BUT THERE NOT SURE CAUSE THEY NEVER SAW THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. AND THEY WERENT GOING TO PAY FOR MY RENTAL CAUSE THE PART WAS OUT OF WARRENTY AFTER 36000MILES. I HAVE HAD EVERY SVC DONE AT TOYOTA. AND IF THERES A COMPUTER PT THAT TOYOTA KNOWS CAN BRAKE EASILY. WHICH THEY DO. THATS WHY ITS ONLY WARRENTY TO 36000MILES. IT SHOULDNT RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR BRAKES AND POWER STEERING. VERY DANGEROUS!! I COULD OF DIED.

AS I GOT INTO ON LOCAL ROADS, I SUDDENLY LOST MY BRAKING ABILITY.  FORTUNATELY I WAS GOING SLOWLY AND WAS ABLE TO ROLL TO A STOP.

IF YOU PRESSED THE BRAKE TO THE FLOOR--THERE WAS SOME RESIDUAL SLOWING--SO I CREPT HOME.  AAA TOWED MY CAR TO TOYOTA THE NEXT DAY AND TOYOTA ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AS A COMPUTER PROBLEM.  THEY REPLACED THE 1 89540-47130 COMPUTER ASSEMBLY, SKID.  ASIDE FROM THE COST ($2250), ITS THE POSSIBILITY THAT I COULD HAVE LOST MY BRAKES ON EITHER OF THE TWO HIGHWAYS THAT I TAKE ON THE WAY HOME, EXIT RAMPS, TOLL BOOTHS, AND THAT I OR SOME OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT, REALLY UPSETS ME.

I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FAILURE OF MY BRAKES AND MY INTERMITTENT ACCELERATION ISSUES ARE NOT SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE CARS \"COMPUTER\" SYSTEM AND NOT MECHANICAL ISSUES. I HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS WITH TOYOTA FOR THESE ISSUES (CASES # 200807100210, 200811030088).    I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST BRAKING ISSUE ON 27-JUN-2008 (25,133 MILES). WHILE I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE CAR TO A STOP EVENTUALLY, THE SLOWING OF MY CAR WAS A VERY GRADUAL PROCESS REQUIRING HEAVY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE WITH MINIMAL BRAKING RESPONSE. I WENT TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. THE DTC CODE AT THE TIME WAS C1247 WITH \"CODE 179\" STORED, THERE WAS \"NO BRAKE ASSIST.\" THE DEALERSHIP RESET THE MEMORY AND REINITIALIZED THE LINEAR SOLENOID VALVE AND CALIBRATION. THE BRAKES WERE REPORTED TO HAVE RETURNED TO \"NORMAL.\"     ON 09-JUL-2008 (25,551 MILES), I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE MY BRAKES FAILED AGAIN. THIS TIME MY BRAKE FAILURE RESULTED IN A CAR ACCIDENT (THE PERSON I HIT STATED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT HE HAD WHIPLASH BUT HE NEVER CONTACTED ME AFTERWARDS). TOYOTA REPLACED THE SKID CONTROL ECU AND RECHECKED OPERATION REASSURING ME ONCE AGAIN THAT THE BRAKES HAD RETURNED TO \"NORMAL.\"     ON 03-NOV-2008 (29,575 MILES) AS I WAS DRIVING OVER 65 ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY MY BRAKES AGAIN FAILED (DTC C1247, CODE 179). TOYOTA CASE #08300402. AT THIS POINT THE REPAIR SHOP REPLACED THE BRAKE STROKE SENSOR.  I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE MY CAR HAD AN ACCELERATION ISSUE ON 13-FEB-2010 AND I FIND IT TO BE \"SLIPPING\" AGAIN ON DRY ROADS. SIMILAR PROBLEMS TO THOSE I HAD BEFORE MY BRAKES FAILED. PLEASE HELP.

UPON COMING TO THE STOPLIGHT, I NOTICED THE CARS IN FRONT OF ME STOPPED AT THE STOPLIGHT SO I WENT TO HIT MY BRAKES AND DID NOT FEEL ANY POWER FROM MY BRAKES SO I QUICKLY STOOD ON MY BRAKES WITH BOTH FEET AND REALIZED I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO BRAKE POWER.  I SUBSEQUENTLY CRASHED QUITE HARD INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND EXPERIENCED SEVERE PAIN TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY NECK.

AFTER GOING TO KAISER TO LOOK INTO MY INJURY (WHICH WAS WHIPLASH) I WAS TOLD AT THE AUTOBODY SHOP THAT MY CAR WAS TOTALED AND COULD NOT BE FIXED.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE I HAD HIT A LARGER AMERICAN CAR WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN MY BUMPER.

I WAS ABOUT TO BACK MY PRIUS OUT OF ITS DIAGONAL PARKING SPACE ON A BUSY MAIN STREET IN DOWNTOWN EL CAJON, CA. IT WAS DAYTIME. VEHICLES WERE PARKED ON EITHER SIDE OF ME, WHICH PREVENTED ME FROM SEEING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS TRAFFIC APPROACHING.    I CAREFULLY BACKED OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE UNTIL I COULD SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS TRAFFIC APPROACHING. I SAW THAT THERE WAS AND IT WAS APPROACHING QUICKLY, SO WITH THE INTENTION OF STOPPING MY CAR'S BACKWARDS MOVEMENT AND, INSTEAD, GOING FORWARD INTO MY PARKING SPACE, I HIT THE BRAKES AND QUICKLY MOVED THE GEARSHIFT LEVER OVER TO THE LEFT AND FULLY DOWN INTO THE DRIVE GATE TO THE STOP POSITION, BEFORE I RELEASED THE SPRING-LOADED SHIFT LEVER (WHICH SENDS IT BACK TO ITS 'HOME' POSITION). I THEN QUICKLY PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, INTENDING FOR THE CAR TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT I COULD DRIVE BACK INTO MY PARKING SPACE.    TO MY SHOCK, MY CAR JUMPED FURTHER BACKWARDS INTO THE TRAFFIC LANE, INSTEAD OF FORWARDS INTO MY PARKING SPACE.    HAVING GOOD REFLEXES, AND IN SOMEWHAT OF A PANIC NOW, I ONCE AGAIN SHOVED THE GEARSHIFT LEVER FULLY INTO THE DRIVE GATE AND FULLY DOWN UNTIL IT CONTACTED THE STOP, BEFORE LETTING GO OF IT. ONCE AGAIN I PUNCHED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND ONCE AGAIN THE CAR JUMPED -- BACKWARDS!    I FULLY APPLIED THE BRAKES AND HOPED THAT THE ONCOMING VEHICLES WOULD NOT HIT ME. FORTUNATELY, THEY DID NOT.    THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF THE GEARSHIFT LEVER ON THE 2005 PRIUS IS MOVED TOO QUICKLY, THERE WILL BE NO GEAR CHANGE. THIS COULD BE CORRECTED IF THE GEAR SELECTOR REMAINED IN THE APPROPRIATE GEAR'S GATE, GIVING THE ELECTRONICS TIME TO MAKE THE SHIFT.

I APPLIED MY BRAKES AND THE CAR WAS BRAKING AS USUAL SLOWING DOWN NORMALLY UNTIL ABOUT 10 MPH, OR SO, AT WHICH POINT I FELT THE CAR BOUNCE VERY SLIGHTLY AND GENTLY AS IF THERE WAS A SMALL GRADUAL DIP AND RISE IN THE ROADWAY SURFACE.  MY FOOT WAS STILL APPLYING LIGHT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS I INTENDED TO COME TO A NEAR CRAWL AS I NEARED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, BUT AFTER THE SLIGHT BUMP THE BRAKE PEDAL GRADUALLY WENT TO THE FLOOR AND MY CAR PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY BRAKING IN EFFECT.  AFTER THE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED TO A POINT NEAR THE FLOOR I PUMPED THE BRAKE PEDAL ONCE AND PRESS ON IT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE.  AT THIS POINT THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL BRAKE APPLIED AND THE RR TIRE SQUEALED AS IT APPEARS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE BRAKING.  I CONTINUED PRESSING UNTIL THE CAR CAME TO A STOP AT WHICH POINT I NOTICE THAT SEVERAL OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTS WERE NOW ON, INCLUDING THE ONES FOR THE BRAKE, THE ABS, AND VSC.  I THEN CONTINUED DRIVING SLOWLY HOME, ABOUT 2 MI., BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT ONLY THE RR BRAKE WAS WORKING AND THAT THERE WAS NOT POWER ASSIST WITH THE BRAKING.  WHEN I GOT HOME I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTED, AND UPON RESTART THE BRAKES APPEARED TO WORK PROPERLY AND SOME OR PERHAPS ALL OF THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE OFF.    I TOOK THE CAR TO BILL KIDD TOYOTA IN TIMONIUM, MD ON 11/9/09 AND THEY REPORTED THAT SCAN CODE C1357 WAS PRESENT.

WHEN IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS OLD WITH APPROXIMATELY 40 THOUSAND MILES ON IT (3 YEARS AGO) THE GAS PEDAL STUCK AND IT WAS NOT RELATED TO A FLOOR MAT. I WAS ACCELERATING GETTING UP TO THE 55MPH SPEED LIMIT WHILE ALSO CLIMBING A HILL GOING OUT OF TOWN INTO THE MOUNTAINS. WHEN I CRESTED THE HILL AND LET UP OFF THE GAS IT JUST KEPT GOING. IT WAS QUITE LUCKY THAT IT HAPPENED ON A STRAIGHTAWAY JUST BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN CURVES AND DROP OFFS. AS A LIFELONG PROFESSIONAL DRIVER WITH EXPERIENCE OPERATING JUST ABOUT ANYTHING MY FIRST LEARNED REACTION WAS TO DIG MY HEELS IN AND PULL THE FLOOR MAT BACK, IT'S HAPPENED TO ME IN OTHER VEHICLES. I GLANCED DOWN AND THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS AT THE PEDAL. MY SEVERELY DISABLED SON WAS WITH ME. AUTOMATICALLY, I STARTED KICKING THE GAS PEDAL. AFTER SEVERAL KICKS IT SLOWED. NO PROBLEM SINCE. NEVER REPORTED THE INCIDENT. JUST FIGURED A WEIRD GLITCH. HAD NOT TRIED BRAKES YET, NOR NEUTRAL, IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CAR, A BIT SCARED TO TRY TO TURN IT OFF WHILE GOING DOWN THE ROAD. I HAD ALREADY SPOTTED A DECENT PLACE TO DITCH THE CAR WITH MINIMAL DAMAGE. I HAD REACHED 75 TO 80 MPH WHEN KICKING THE PEDAL STOPPED IT. IT'S A COMPUTER THING.  *TR",

THE FIRST WAS WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON A SIDE-STREET. I WAS GOING SLOW, LESS THEN 15 MILES PER HOUR, AND STEPPED ON THE BRAKES TO MAKE A TURN. THE BRAKES WERE UNRESPONSIVE FOR APROX. 2 SECONDS CAUSING ME TO ROLL BEFORE THE BRAKES ENGAGE. THE SECOND OCCURED WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AT A LOW SPEED, UNDER 40 MILES AN HOUR, ON A MAIN ROAD. AS SHE APPROACHED THE STOPLIGHT SHE STEPPED ON THE BRAKES, WHICH ALSO FAILED TO ENGAGE. DUE TO HER HIGHER SPEED SHE ROLLED OVER 10 FEET AND CAME CLOSE TO HITTING THE CAR STOPPED IN FRONT OF HER BEFORE THE BRAKES FINALLY ENGAGED. THE FINAL OCCURANCE ALSO OCCURED WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING, THIS TIME AT A HIGHER SPEED BETWEEN 40 AND 50 MILES PER HOUR, WHEN PRESSING ON THE BRAKES ON AN OVERPASS THE BRAKES FAILED TO ENGAGE AND THE CAR PHYSICALLY SEEMED TO SHAKE A BIT. AFTER BEING UNABLE TO STOP FOR SEVERAL FEET THE BRAKES FINALLY ENGAGED. WE BELIEVE THESE OCCURANCES ARE DUE TO AN ERROR WITH OUR ABS SYSTEM.

WHENEVER THE ROAD IS SLIPPERY, IF THE CAR SENSES WHEELSPIN, IT CUTS POWER TO THE ENGINE. THIS IS SCARY IF YOU'RE PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC ON A RAINY DAY, AS THE CAR WILL SOMETIMES JUST QUIT RUNNING FOR A SECOND, LEAVING YOU VULNERABLE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. SNOW IS FAR WORSE. I LIVE ON A HILLY ROAD. IF IT'S SNOWY THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN, AND SIMPLY STOP TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE FIRST STEEP SLOPE I COME TO. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD I MASH ON THE ACCELERATOR, OR IF I BACK OFF AND TRY AGAIN, THE CAR WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE. ONCE THE CAR STOPS MOVING FORWARD IT BEGINS TO SLIDE BACKWARDS, AND CONTROL IS TOTALLY LOST. I WAS NEARLY KILLED THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED (IN ABOUT ONE INCH OF SNOW) AS MY CAR EVENTUALLY SLIPPED SIDEWAYS ACROSS THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE. AN SUV CAME DOWN THE HILL AND NEARLY BROADSIDED ME BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CAR TURNED BACK DOWN THE HILL. (MY CAR WAS EQUIPPED WITH AGGRESSIVE SNOW TIRES AT THE TIME.)

THE 2010 PRIUS'S AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WITH PROBLEMS; MINE DOES THE SAME THING. IF I'M BRAKING ON A BUMPY STRETCH OF ROAD OR OVER A MANHOLE COVER IN THE RAIN, THE CAR WILL CUT POWER TO THE BRAKES, CAUSING THE CAR TO FEEL LIKE IT'S SURGING FORWARD. AGAIN THIS PROBLEM IS MUCH WORSE IN THE SNOW. GOING DOWNHILL ON A SNOWY, SLIPPERY HILL THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES REPEATEDLY CUT BRAKING POWER, WHICH ACTUALLY CAUSES THE CAR TO ACCELERATE TO UNSAFE SPEEDS.

THE PRIUS DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF POWER, SO FLOORING IT WAS SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO PASS UPHILL. WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL, THE CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING. I TOUCHED THE BRAKES. NOTHING. FINALLY, I PUSHED DOWN HARD ON THE BRAKES AND GOT THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED IT OFF. I HAVE RUBBER MATS. I THOUGHT ONE OF THEM HAD GONE UNDER THE PEDAL. \"CASE SOLVED\" SO I THOUGHT.  LAST DECEMBER, AGAIN PASSING A TRUCK UPHILL ON ROUTE 840, I FLOORED THE PRUIS GAS PEDAL. THE SAME THING HAPPENED! THIS TIME I KNEW IT WAS NOT THE MAT BECAUSE I HAD DRILLED HOLES IN IT AND ATTACHED IT TO THE MAT POSTS. IT WAS INCHES AWAY FROM THE GAS PEDAL WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  I PUSHED THE BRAKES DOWN HARD AND STRUGGLED THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD RIGHT BEFORE THE LANES MERGED AND THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE CUT ME OFF (INTO A SWAMP). THE BRAKES, WITH A BURNING SMELL, FOUGHT THE RACING CAR. I FINALLY GOT IT TURNED OFF. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, THE GAS WAS STILL RACING! I TURNED IT OFF AGAIN. AFTER WAITING,IT STARTED NORMALLY.  IT HAS DONE IT EVERY TIME THE PEDAL WAS FLOORED(SELDOM).  I WENT TO THE INTERNET AND FOUND THIS HAD BEEN A PROBLEM AND TOYOTA WAS PLANNING A PRIUS RECALL, WITH PARTS TO REPAIR AVAILABLE IN APRIL.   I WAS VERY SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR, BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO SELL IT (WRONG) OR BUY ANOTHER. SO I DECIDED TO WAIT FOR THE RECALL. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON PINS AND NEEDLES SINCE.  AND NOW THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THE PRIUS GAS PEDAL!  I'M GLAD FOR THE BRAKE RECALL BECAUSE MY PRIUS HAS DONE THAT ONCE TOO, BUT FREAKED OUT ABOUT NO STICKING GAS PEDAL RECALL FOR THE PRIUS.  I WENT TO THE DEALER TODAY FOR 115,000K SERVICE AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS.  \"TECHNICIAN CAN NOT REPLICATE PROBLEM\". JUST LIKE SO MANY STORIES FROM OTHER  TOYOTA OWNERS ON THE WEB.

IT WAS FIXED BY A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN WELLESLEY, MA AND THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE CODES FOR THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE (SOMETHING I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT AT THE TIME). THEY SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET CODES FROM CALIFORNIA.  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNEW AT THAT TIME ABOUT AN EXISTING BROADER PROBLEM BUT DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME, SINCE I WAS A NEW TOYOTA PRIUS OWNER AT THE TIME.  I FOUND IT PUZZLING THAT THEY COULD NOT FIX THE PROBLEM LOCALLY.      LATELY, I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE RECALL OF VARIOUS TOYOTA CARS SO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY PRIUS JUST IN CASE:  1) SOMETIMES, WHEN THE CAR IS PUT IN PARK, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY REVS UP FOR NO REASON (I'M NOT PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL)  2) VERY OCCASIONALLY, I DRIVE OVER A POTHOLE AND AS THE CAR IS RE-CONTACTING THE GROUND, THE ENGINE AGAIN SEEMS TO REV UP.  THIS HAS NOT RESULTED IN AN ACTUAL SERIOUS ACCELERATION YET  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE FLOOR MATS OR PEDALS. THE FLOOR MATS FIT NICELY AROUND THE PEDALS.      ASIDE FROM THE ABOVE, MY TOYOTA, WHICH I DRIVE A LOT (IT HAS MORE THAN 100,000 MILES ALREADY) HAS DONE RATHER WELL, WITH MINIMAL SERIOUS PROBLEMS.  I'VE BEEN GOOD ABOUT GETTING IT SERVICED REGULARLY.    PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME WITH QUESTIONS. *TR",

IT TOOK APPROX. 5 TO 10 SECONDS TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFECT AND MAKE A CORRECTION THAT RELIT THE LIGHTS.  THE VEHICLE TRAVELED FROM 500 FEET TO 1000 FEET PER INCIDENT.  FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO COLLISION.    AT NEITHER TOYOTA DEALER, WERE WE ADVISED THAT THIS WAS A RECURRING PROBLEM ON PRIUS'S, WHICH I FOUND OUT ON-LINE. *TR",

THE INVERTER PUMP THAT SUPPLIES COOLANT TO ALL THE ENGINE PARTS HAD MALFUNCTIONED.  THE MECHANICS TOLD US THAT THE TOYOTA COMPANY WAS AWARE THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD OCCUR ON OUR 05 PRIUS.  IF WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A TOYOTA DEALER THE DEFECTIVE INVERTER PUMP WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A MORE RECENT MODEL FREE OF CHARGE.  THE NEXT DAY WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY EXAMINED THE CAR AND VERIFIED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A DEFECTIVE INVERTER PUMP.  THEIR CODES AS PRINTED ON THEIR INVOICE NUMBER 524093 [21 JULY 2009] ARE \"34352 PULLED CODE POA93, SUB CODE 346-INVERTER COOLING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. FOUND TSB EG001-07 TO CORRECT THIS CONCERN.  REPLACED INVERTER WATER PUMP AS PER STB.\"     THIS CATASTROPHIC MALFUNCTION OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING.  WE HAVE MAINTAINED THE CAR WITH REGULAR MAINTENANCE AS PER THE SCHEDULE IN THE OWNERS MANUAL.  WE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT THE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED WHILE WE WERE IN TOWN.  SINCE WE LIVE IN NEW MEXICO THE MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE OCCURRED OUT IN ONE OF OUR DESERTS OR ON ONE OF OUR MOUNTAINS.  WE ARE BOTH 73 YEARS OF AGE AND BOTH CANCER SURVIVORS.  THE LAST THING THAT WE NEEDED WAS TO BE STRANDED SOMEWHERE OR TO HAVE THE ENGINE COMPLETELY DESTROYED IF WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE CAR.

MY WARRANTY WAS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER IN WISCONSIN AND THEY SAID THEY HAD FIXED IT. HOWEVER I COULD SEE UP AGAINST THE WALL THAT IT WAS NOT. I TOLD THEM I WOULD NOT LEAVE TILL THEY FIXED IT. THEY GAVE ME BACK THE CAR AND THE HEADLIGHTS WORKED FOR A FEW DAYS THEN STARTED THE ON OFF THING AGAIN. PROBLEM IS YOU ARE NOT SURE WHEN IT HAPPENS...IF THE ROAD IS LIT AT ALL IT'S HARDER TO TELL. BUT I WHEN I HAD TO MAKE A TRIP OUT EAST THERE WERE ROADS WITH NO LIGHT SO ALL THAT WAS SEEN WAS THE PARKING LIGHTS. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING BLIND. I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHERS THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY AND I WILL BE JOINING A CLASS ACTION LAW-SUIT. THIS IS LIFE THREATENING AND TOYOTA KNOWS VERY WELL ABOUT IT AND ALL THE DEALERS ARE JUST PRETENDING NOT TO. THERE MUST BE A RECALL RIGHT AWAY!!!!

IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRIP, WE STOPPED BRIEFLY AND TURNED OFF THE CAR. WHEN WE RESUMED OUR TRIP, WE NOTICED THE HEADLIGHTS WERE NOW VERY LOW, SO LOW THAT WE DARED NOT GO OVER ABOUT 20 MPH.     WE SCHEDULED A VISIT TO OUR TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT; BUT WHILE THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE STILL ON, THE HEADLIGHTS WERE NOW AIMED NORMALLY. PRIOR TO THIS SERVICE VISIT, AN INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED THAT A NUMBER OF 2004-2005 PRIUSES HAVE EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH THE SENSOR IN THE REAR OF THE CAR, IN THE VICINITY OF THE LEFT REAR TIRE WELL, THAT MEASURES THE LOAD ON THE REAR END AND ADJUSTS THE HEADLIGHTS ACCORDINGLY.  TOYOTA HAS PUBLISHED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE PROBLEM. IT APPEARS THAT IN A NUMBER OF PRIUSES, THE SENSOR IS DEFECTIVE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND DIFFICULT TO DETECT.  I SHARED WITH THE DEALER WHAT I KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, E-MAILED (AT THEIR REQUEST) THE TSB, AND ASKED THAT EVEN THOUGH OUR CAR WAS RECENTLY OUT OF WARRANTY, SINCE IT HAD ONLY 25,000 MILES ON IT AND THE PROBLEM WAS CLEARLY A SYSTEMATIC MANUFACTURING DEFECT AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD, THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REMEDY THE PROBLEM AT NO CHARGE.     DURING MY DISCUSSION WITH THE SERVICE ADVISER, HE ADMITTED THAT WHILE NO FAULT CODE COULD BE DETECTED, THE ONLY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM HAD TO BE THE SENSOR. THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THERE WAS NO WAY TOYOTA WOULD COVER THE REPAIR; THAT ALREADY IN THE PAST MONTH, 15 OF THESE UNITS HAD  TO BE REPLACED IN THE REGION AND NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN COVERED BY WARRANTY.  HOWEVER, THE SERVICE ADVISOR INDICATED THE DEALERSHIP ITSELF WOULD COVER THE PART ($470) IF I AGREED TO PAY FOR THE INSTALLATION ($200).  I DID SO AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOW BEEN REMEDIED. *TR",

THE MFD INITIALIZED TO THE MPG SCREEN BUT HAD UNUSUAL COLORS.  I ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE THE DISPLAY SCREEN BY SELECTING THE AUDIO, CLIMATE, DISPLAY, AND INFO BUTTONS BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE SCREEN WOULD GO BLANK AND THEN SHOW THE ?PRIUS HYBRID? INITIALIZING SCREEN AND THEN RETURN TO THE MPG SCREEN.    AS I WAS NEARING MY 80K SERVICE, I CONTACTED MY DEALER AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE MFD AS BEING UNSERVICEABLE THAT NEXT SATURDAY.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE MADE THE COMMENT THAT IT WAS COMMON FOR THE MFD TO GO BAD.  TO REPLACE THE MFD WITH A NEW ONE, IT IS $4,000.00 PLUS INSTALLATION.  THAT IS 19% OF THE COST OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW!     I BEGAN RESEARCHING AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON 10 JANUARY 2005 TITLE: MULTI-DISPLAY FUNCTIONS ARE INOPERATIVE; TSB# EL002-05 WHICH IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH THE MFD.  ALSO IN BROWSING THE WEB SPECIFICALLY WWW.PRIUSCHAT.COM AND HTTP://AUTOS.GROUPS.YAHOO.COM/GROUP/PRIUS-2G/ AND SAW THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  ONE ELECTRONICALLY GIFTED PERSON DISASSEMBLED HIS MFD AND DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS IMPROPER SOLDERING ON THE CIRCUIT CARD (SEE HTTP://TECHNO-FANDOM.ORG/~HOBBIT/CARS/MFD/COMPARE.HTML ).     IT SEEMS THAT TOYOTA CORPORATION WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WERE NOT DISCLOSING IT HOPING THAT THE FAULTY MFD?S WOULD NOT BE DISCOVERED UNTIL THE VEHICLES EXCEEDED THE 3 YEAR 36,000 WARRANTY.  I KNOW I AM OUTSIDE THE MILEAGE WARRANTY, HOWEVER, I AM JUST PASSED THE 3 YEAR WINDOW. I PURCHASED AND USE MY CAR AS A COMMUTER VEHICLE DRIVING ALMOST 100 MILES PER DAY.  AS A MAINTENANCE OFFICER IN THE US ARMY, I KNOW THERE ARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE MILEAGE DEPENDENT (ENGINES, TRANSMISSIONS, DIFFERENTIALS) BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE.    THIS HAS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY WHEN THE BRAKES ARE WET FROM RAIN. AFTER DISCUSSING WITH TOYOTA I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE TOYOTA TEAM LEADER AT MY DEALER.  BEFORE TEST DRIVING THE CAR, HE SAID HE WOULD TAKE IT INSIDE AND PULL THE TIRES AND INSPECT THE BRAKES.  I WAS THEN ADVISED BY SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE REAR BRAKES (DRUM) WERE FILLED WITH BRAKE DUST.    I FIND IT INCONSISTENT THAT THE LARGE ACCUMULATION OF BRAKE DUST DID NOT EXIST ABOUT 8,000 MILES AGO WHEN THE GRABBING CONDITION FIRST PRESENTED AFTER I HAD DRIVEN WITHOUT THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 21,000 MILES.

AFTER LEAVING MORRISTOWN TOYOTA I PHONED MY MECHANIC.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO BUILDUP OF DUST AT ANY TIME THE BRAKES WERE PULLED.

CA, AND WHILE STILL ON THE FREEWAY TRAVELING AT 65 MPH, A CONTINUOUS LOUD AND HIGH FREQUENCY BUZZER WENT ON AND THE PANEL WARNING LIGHTS WENT ON INCLUDING THE RED BRAKE LIGHT ON THE PANEL.  I PULLED OFF A FREEWAY EXIT NEAR CASTROVILLE, CA AND STEPPED ON MY BRAKES TO SLOW INTO THE EXIT, THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK UNTIL I STOMPED ON THEM WITH MUCH PRESSURE.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE, WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND TURNED THE ENGINE BACK ON.  I DROVE BACK ONTO THE FREEWAY TO MONTEREY, CA AT APPROXIMATELY 35-40 MPH, WHEN I DROVE INTO TOWN ONCE AGAIN THE BUZZER AND RED BRAKE LIGHTS WENT ON.I  PULLED OVER TO THE CURB AND HAD TO STOMP ON THE BRAKE AGAIN. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN SEASIDE CA.  THE VEHICLE WAS TESTED AND I WAS SHOWN A TEST FORM INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION LISTED AS CM1300.  THE CONCLUSION OF THE MECHANIC WAS THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT A REPLACEMENT PART MAY BE NEEDED WHICH WOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS AND THAT THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE TO MY USE OF SKID CONTROL AT THE TIME OF THE MALFUNCTIONS THAT I EXPERIENCED.    I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD DRIVE THE CAR HOME AND THAT I SHOULD STOP EVERY 15 MILES TO STOP AND REBOOT THE CAR AGAIN TO PREVENT THE MALFUNCTION FROM OCCURRING AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THAT IF THE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED AGAIN THAT I SHOULD STOMP ON THE BRAKE REALLY HARD AND THE SKID CONTROL WOULD SOMEHOW BE ACTIVATED. I MADE IT HOME SAFELY AND DROVE AS ADVISED TO.   I TOOK THE CAR THE NEXT MORNING TO BERKELEY, TOYOTA AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE TEST DRIVE AND THEIR TESTING SHOWED NO MALFUNCTION AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE THE CAR HOME, BUT THE MALFUNCTION MIGHT OCCUR AGAIN.  I FIND THIS AN UNSATISFACTORY RESPONSE.  I AM EXTREMELY FEARFUL OF DRIVING THE CAR WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION TO WHY THE CAR MALFUNCTIONED IN A VERY DANGEROUS WAY WHERE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO USE MY BRAKES!!   *NM",

THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DUE TO A WOEFULLY INADEQUATE JACK SUPPLIED BY TOYOTA WITH MY 2005 PRIUS. THE JACK BENT WHILE TRYING TO LIFT THE AUTOMOBILE.  LIFTING THE CAR WAS ATTEMPTED THREE TIMES BY SLIGHTLY REPOSITIONING THE BASE OF THE JACK.  IT WAS FINALLY NECESSARY TO BRACE THE JACK WITH PIECES OF WOOD IN ORDER TO LIFT THE AUTOMOBILE HIGH ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED TIRE.  THE PONY SPARE HAD TO BE DEFLATED TO GET IT INTO PLACE IN ORDER TO APPLY THE LUG NUTS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE JACK TO LIFT THE CAR FOR ADEQUATE CLEARANCE.  LUCKILY I HAD AN ELECTRIC AIR PUMP ON BOARD TO RE-INFLATE THE PONY SPARE.  THE ENTIRE OPERATION TOOK 1 HOUR 45 MINUTES.    SEVERAL POINTS SHOULD BE MADE.  I AM NOT AN IDIOT.  I HAVE CHANGED FLATS PREVIOUSLY.  THE JACK WAS NEW AS SUPPLIED WITH THE PRIUS PURCHASED IN LATE 2004; IT HAD NEVER BEEN USED.  THE TIRE CHANGE OCCURRED ON AN ALMOST COMPLETELY FLAT SURFACE.  THE BASE OF THE JACK WAS RESTING ON CEMENT.  THE WEATHER WAS GOOD; NO ICE, SNOW, WIND OR RAIN.  MY LIGHTING WAS GOOD.  I LIFTED THE PRIUS WHERE INDICATED.  I HAD BLOCKED THE REAR TIRES WITH BRICKS PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING TO LIFT THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS NOT LOADED WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT.    I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE JACK THAT WAS SUPPLIED WITH THE PRIUS.  AS A CONSUMER, ONE WOULD NOT THINK OF INSPECTING SUCH BASIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO DECIDING ON AN AUTOMOBILE.  THE AUTOMOBILE COULD HAVE EASILY SLIPPED FROM THE JACK DURING THE TIRE CHANGING OPERATION.  SEVERE INJURY COULD OCCUR TO THE INDIVIDUAL(S) OR THE VEHICLE ITSELF.  MY FATHER RECENTLY BOUGHT A PRIUS AT MY SUGGESTION PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  I NOW FEAR FOR HIS SAFETY KNOWING HOW INADEQUATE THE JACK IS THAT IS SUPPLIED WITH THIS VEHICLE.  *JB",

IN EACH CASE ALL LIGHTS, HEADLIGHTS, INDICATORS STAYED ON, THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT CAME ON, THE CAR CONTINUED COASTING (AS IF PUT IN NEUTRAL), AND THE CAR WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO THE THROTTLE AND THE GEAR SHIFT. (IN NEITHER CASE DID I HIT THE GEAR SHIFT NOR POWER BUTTON BEFORE THE \"STALL\"). IN BOTH CASES I COASTED TO A SAFE SPOT (TRY CROSSING FIVE LANES OF 70+ MPH FREEWAY TRAFFIC AT NIGHT WHILE COASTING). ONLY AFTER PARKING, TURNING OFF POWER, AND RESTARTING POWER WOULD THE CAR OPERATE...AT WHICH POINT IT OPERATED FINE. DEALER COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG...IN FACT THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS TWO DAYS AFTER MY 30,000 MILE SERVICE!  THEY APPARENTLY TOOK NO ACTION REGARDING THE CONCERN I EXPRESSED TO THE SERVICE REP WITH RESPECT TO STALLING...HE ASSURED ME THEY WOULD CHECK FOR ALL AVAILABLE SOFTWARE UPDATES, BUT CORPORATE TOLD ME TODAY THERE IS AT LEAST ONE UPDATE (RELATING TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM) WHICH WAS NOT DOWNLOADED, SO APPARENTLY THE DEALER IS NOT RESPONDING TO THIS LIFE-THREATENING CONCERN.       I CALLED CORPORATE TODAY TO START A \"CASE\" AND WAS TOLD THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT THIS IS A RECURRENT ISSUE.  THIS DESPITE DISCUSSIONS IN THE PRESS AND ON HYBRIDCARS.COM.  I AM CONTACTING YOU IN CASE I AM KILLED OR INJURED BEFORE TOYOTA FIGURES OUT THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS AND RECURRENT ISSUE.     THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS AROUND JANUARY OR FEBRUARY 2005, AND THE MOST RECENT WAS MONDAY SEPT 19 2005. *JB",

HOWEVER, HE ALSO TOLD ME NOT GET THE CAR ENGINE WET. HE WARNED THAT IF I EVER RETURNED THE CAR WITH A WET ENGINE AGAIN THAT MY WARRANTY WOULD BE VOIDED.

TO: TOYOTA CUSTOMER SUPPORT    SIR OR MADAM:    I BOUGHT MY 2005 PRIUS NEW FROM MECHANICSVILLE TOYOTA ON DECEMBER 1, 2004 AND GENERALLY WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE CAR AND THE GREAT GAS MILEAGE IT PROVIDES. HOWEVER, LAST THURSDAY, 4/7/05, WITH 4738 MILES ON THE ODOMETER, WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK, ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASH WENT ON INCLUDING THE MASTER WARNING LIGHT, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, VSC LIGHT, AND THE MULTI INFORMATION DISPLAY IS SHOWING THE RED HYBRID SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT. THE CAR LOST POWER AND I HAD TO LIMP IT HOME. THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION DISPLAY FOR THE BATTERY PACK SHOWED ONE RED BAR AND THE FUEL GAUGE HAD TWO BARS LEFT.     I CALLED TOYOTA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WHICH PROMPTLY DISPATCHED A TOW TRUCK AND DELIVERED THE CAR TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER DID A DIAGNOSTIC TEST THE FOLLOWING MORNING, FRIDAY, 4/8/05, AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I GOT WAS THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSSUE WITH 2 BARS OF FUEL LEFT AND THE CAUSE WAS THAT THE ENGINE SUCKED IN AIR WITH STOPS OR TURNS.     IS THERE A FURTHER EXPLANATION OR FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM? I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I CROSS RAILROAD TRACKS TO AND FROM WORK DAILY AND DEFINITELY WILL NOT WANT THIS CAR TO STALL ON THE TRACKS OR ANYWHERE ON THE ROAD.

ALSO THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START AGAIN BECAUSE THE BATTERIES RUNNING THE ELECTRIC MOTOR WERE NOT ASSISTING IN THE DRIVE OF THE CAR AS DESIGNED.  I NOTICED A NOTE ON A WEB SITE THIS EVENING THAT INDICATED THE CAR WOULD NOT RUN WHEN THE BATTERIES WERE BELOW A 20% CHARGE.  IF THIS IS CORRECT, IT WOULD FIT IN WITH MY THEORY.  THE SHIFT LEVER NEEDS TO BE HARDER TO MOVE SO THAT ACCIDENTAL CHANGES SUCH AS I EXPERIENCED WOULD BE PREVENTED.  IF THIS IS TOO EXPENSIVE, MAYBE A CHEAPER WAY TO FIX TGHE PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR AN ALARM LIGHT OR AUDIBLE SIGNAL TO GO ON WHEN THE BATTERY PROPULSION HAD BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG UNASSISTED BY THE GASOLINE MOTOR.

WHEN I BACKED OUT FAR ENOUGH INTO THE TRAFFIC LANE, I REALIZED THAT TRAFFIC WAS COMING. I NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY TO AVOID GETTING HIT. I QUICKLY MOVED THE SHIFT LEVER TO D AND ACCELERATED. THE CAR LURCHED BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS. I HIT THE BRAKE AND QUICKLY BUT CAREFULLY SHIFTED TO D AGAIN. APPROACHING TRAFFIC WAS NOW ALMOST AT MY LOCATION. I ACCELERATED AGAIN BUT THE CAR LURCHED BACKWARDS, NOT FORWARDS, AGAIN. THE CAR HAD IGNORED BOTH INPUTS FROM ME AND REMAINED IN REVERSE.    LUCKILY THE APPROACHING TRAFFIC SLOWED TO AVOID CRASHING INTO ME, GIVING ME TIME TO SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY MOVE THE SHIFT LEVER TO D. THIS TIME THE CAR MOVED FORWARD.    I CAN EASILY SHIFT THE LEVER TOO QUICKLY, WHICH RESULTS IN NO GEAR CHANGE. TOYOTA SAID THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION IS NORMAL FOR THE PRIUS.

I BELIEVE TOYOTA SHOULD PUT ALL CARS THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ON THE SIDELINES UNTIL THEY FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN COME UP WITH A FIX.    BECAUSE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF INJURIES, NHTSA SHOULD START AN INVESTIGATION AND START PUSHING TOYOTA TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.",
