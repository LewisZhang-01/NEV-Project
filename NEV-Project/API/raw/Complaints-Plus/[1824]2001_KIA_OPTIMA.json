I STATED THIS CONDITION JUST STARTED TODAY. THE TECHNICIAN WHEN BACK AND INSPECTED THE CAR IN MORE DETAIL. HE RETURNED AN SAID THAT THE ALIGNMENT COULD NOT BE DONE TO GET IT WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. HE TOOK ME TO THE LIFT WHERE THE CAR WAS AND SHOWED ME WHY THE CAR COULD NOT BE ALIGNED. THE LOWER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY WAS SEPARATING FROM THE SUB FRAME OR ENGINE CRADLE OF THE CAR, BECAUSE THE FRAME WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH. HE TECHNICIAN STATED THIS WASN'T IN A VERY SAFE CONDITION. HE ALSO NOTED A 7 YEARS OLD SHOULD NOT SHOW THIS TYPE OF DECAY IN A MAJOR STRUCTURAL COMPONENT. I ASKED THE TECHNICIAN TO GET THE ALIGNMENT AS CLOSE TO THE MANUFACTURERS SPECIFICATION SO I RETURN HOME SAFE. INTERNET RESEARCH SHOWS THE REPLACEMENT PART COSTING $1400. THE ENGINE AND STEERING COMPONENTS ATTACHED TO THIS PART. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE LOCAL KIA DEALER FOR A LABOR COST ESTIMATE. AN INTERNET SEARCH SHOWS THAT OTHER OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE LOWER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FRAME OF THE CAR, BECAUSE THE FRAME WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH. THE ONLY THING HOLDING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR UP WAS THE TIRE. THE TECH THEN TOLD HER THAT THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN AND ASKED WHERE THE DEALER WAS LOCATED. SINCE THE DEALER IS LOCATED ABOUT 20 MILES FROM THAT SHOP, MY WIFE WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT DRIVE IT THERE, THE CAR WAS VERY UNSAFE.  ATLANTIC KIA WAS NOTIFIED OF THIS ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 4TH.

SHE WAS ALLOWED TO DRIVE A HAZARDOUS VEHICLE FROM THE DEALER AND THEN IN TURN WAS TREATED VERY BADLY.
