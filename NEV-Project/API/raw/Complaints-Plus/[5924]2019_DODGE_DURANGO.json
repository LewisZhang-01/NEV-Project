        "summary": "The tracklight on my 2019 Dodge Durango is no longer working. The whole light on the liftgate of the vehicle which is a big part of the brake warning to other vehicles. Which can very likely cause an accident at anytime since the corners of the tail light arent as visible. The vehicle has been evaluated by an independent service center and I was quoted over $1,000 to fix something that is very critical in the safety of a vehicle in my opinion. No warning from the vehicle at all the only reason it was noticed was because another driver that was behind me stopped at a gas station where I stopped and let me know my brake light was out and I was in fear the rest of the ride home that I would get pulled over and cited for something that shouldnt be my problem or responsibility to fix when its clearly a design flaw. I hope Dodge does the right thing and makes a recall on this matter since I have seen this is a very common problem and through searching on the internet I come to find out its due to water entering the light fixture and causing a shortage in the light. If Dodge doesnt do something about this I can see a lot of lawsuits coming to them due to the reason that the neglect can cause someone to get into an accident being as not everyone can afford to pay over $1,000 for repairs.",
