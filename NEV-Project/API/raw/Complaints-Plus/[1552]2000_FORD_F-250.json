WHEN SLOWING DOWN, (EITHER BY DOWNSHIFTING THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION OR COASTING TO A STOP), THE ENGINE WILL SOMETIMES IDLE AT 1500 RPM RATHER THAN THE NOMINAL 700-800 RPM.  IF I DON'T COME TO A COMPLETE STOP (LIKE WHEN TURNING ONTO MY STREET), THE IDLE WILL REMAIN HIGH TRYING TO MAKE THE TRUCK GO FASTER.  IF I DO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP (LIKE AT A STOP SIGN), THE ENGINE WILL IDLE DOWN THE SECOND I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT NOT ONLY MY BUT OTHERS SAFETY AS THE TRUCK TRIES DRIVING FASTER THAN I WANT WHEN THE IDLE IS HIGH.  I HAVE TAKEN THE TRUCK TO SEVERAL DEALERS WHO HAVE PERFORMED MANY SERVICES TO THE TRUCK IN AN ATTEMPT TO DIAGNOSE AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL.  I HAVE REPLACED NUMEROUS SENSORS ON THE TRUCK WITH ORIGINAL FORD EQUIPMENT BUT AGAIN NO IMPROVEMENT.  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD DIRECTLY BUT ALL THEY TELL ME IS TO TAKE THE TRUCK TO MY FORD DEALER.  I AM OUT OF OPTIONS AS THE FORD DEALER CANNOT SEEM TO DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM AND ALONG WITH IT MY CONCERN FOR SAFETY.  *TR",

AROUND NOVEMBER OF 2001 I RECEIVED A SURVEY FORM FROM FORD ASKING BASICALLY HOW I LIKED MY TRUCK. I TOLD THEM ABOUT MY CONCERN WITH THE STEERING.

ON 12/11/01 THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER PERSONALLY CHECKED-OUT THE PROBLEM (WITH ME ALONG), AND AGREED THAT THE STEERING PROBLEM WAS NOT NORMAL AND HIS COMMENT WAS \"IT'S LIKE THE WHEEL IS AGAINST A ROCK\". HE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM BEFORE, AND WOULD CALL THE FORD ENGINEERS. HE CALLED ME LATER THAT SAME DAY AND INFORMED ME THAT FORD WAS ADAMANT THAT THE CONDITION IS \"NORMAL\" AND ABSOLUTELY NO REPAIRS SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED. THEY SAID THAT HE COULD CHANGE ALL THE POWER STEERING PARTS, AND THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY HIM TO DO ANY WORK ON THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE HYDROBOOST SYSTEM DIVERTS ALL OF THE POWER ASSIST TO THE BRAKES AT LOW SPEED AND NOT TO THE POWER STEERING, AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT THIS DESIGN.

SEVERAL DAYS LATER, I HAD TO HIT THE BRAKES RATHER HARD TO AVOID RUNNING OVER A BOTTLE ION THE ROAD.  AS I HIT THE BRAKES, I TRIED TO TURN TO GO AROUND THE BOTTLE.  I NOTICED THAT STEERING THE TRUCK IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WHEN THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES.  WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL, NORMAL STEERING RETURNED.  AS I WAS TREATED POORLY (TO SAY THE LEAST ) BY THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  THIS INVOLVED A 120 MILE ROUND-TRIP DRIVE.  THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME TODAY.  WHEN I GOT THE TRUCK BACK, THE SERVICE MADVISOR, JACK DUGAN, TOLD ME THAT THIS IS \"A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TRUCK\" AND THAT THEY COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  HE ADDED THAT IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY IT HANDLED, CONTACT FORD.  MY RESPONSE IS, WITH ALL OF THE PRESS ABOUT THE F-250, (THANKS TO NHTSA) WHY DO FORD MARKETING REPRESENTATIVES DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY, MIKE VAUGHN, OF FORD MOTOR CO., SPOKE WITH NHTSA AND SAID THAT FORD IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  ALSO, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FROM DRIVER'S EDUCATION, IN THE EVENT OF A SKID, YOU SHOULD STEER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SKID.  THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WITH THIS TRUCK.  I CAN FORESEE MANY ACCIDENTS DUE TO THIS SYSTEM.  ACCORDING TO JACK DUGAN, THE BRAKES AND STEERING USE THE SAME POWER BOOSTER.  I TOW A 23' TRAVEL TRAILER THAT WEIGHS ABOUT 5,000 LBS.  I AM AFRAID TO TOW THE TRAILER BECAUSE OF THIS SITUATION.  THIS HAS PUT QUITE A DAMPER ON OUR SUMMER ACTIVITIES.  CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THE INVESTIGATION IS GOING AND WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM?  I LIKE THE TRUCK OVERALL, BUT CANNOT BELIEVE THE RUN-AROUND I GET FROM FORD AND CASA FORD IN EL PASO.  BORMAN AUTO PLEX HAS TREATED ME VERY WELL THROUGHOUT THIS DILEMA.  PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.  I GAVE A COPY OF THE NHTSA PRINTOUT TO JACK DUGAN AT BORMAN AUTO PLEX.",
