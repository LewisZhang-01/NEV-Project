LOGAN HAS TOLD ME THERE IS NO WARRANTY BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT FROM A PRIVATE PARTY; HOWEVER FAILURE OF THE HITCH REPRESENTS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO WARRANTY LIMITATIONS. I ALSO BELIEVE THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER FAILURES ON MID TO LATE 2000 YEAR RANGE TRAILERS AND HAVE NOT TAKEN APPROPRIATE STEPS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS, LIVESTOCK AND THE MOTORING PUBLIC.  THEY ONLY REMEDY THEY HAVE OFFERED IS REPAIR AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IF I BRING THE TRAILER TO THEM (LOGAN UT) FROM HELENA MT.  THE TRAILER IS NOT SAFE TO GO AROUND THE BLOCK MUCH LESS TO UT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF HITCH DISPLACEMENT AND SEPARATION OF THE TRAILER FROM FRAME, I BELIEVE THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE ENTIRE ALUMINUM TRAILER HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.   *JS",
