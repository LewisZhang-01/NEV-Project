        "summary": "I was driving on Route 78 (an interstate highway) when I heard a loud \"POP\" and suddenly my sunroof's glass was raining down on me.  The front window of my sunroof totally shattered leaving a huge hole in the roof.  Luckily, I did not lose control of the vehicle as I tried to figure out what happened to the sunroof.  I recently had to have the car towed and I did not want to wait for another tow truck so I drove home with the huge hole in the roof.  Upon my arrival home, my husband met me with the shop vac and he cleaned up the glass.   His notes about the situation - there were no scratches or dents on any part of the car, there was no foreign object in the car that may have fallen through the roof, and he thought that the amount of glass he vacuumed out was not all of the glass missing from the roof.  He believed that a lot of the glass must have burst out of the window and onto the highway.  The next day when I drove home (in another car as mine was unable to be used for several days), I looked to see if I could see an unusual object on the side of the road that could have perfectly missed my windshield but hit my sunroof.  There was nothing out of the ordinary on the road.  FYI - The day's weather was fair, in the high 50-s to low 60-s.  It was a cloudy but dry day.  I posted my harrowing experience on Facebook, and a friend told me about the NHTSA.gov website.  Upon searching, I found that several other 2016 Kia Sorentos had exploding sunroof issues.  I reported the issue to my insurance company as I wanted to know how much my deductible was.  Unfortunately, the cost is coming out of my pocket.  I have since had the window fixed.  I did not file a police report as I honestly believed that somehow something got kicked up off the road and onto my roof.  I do not believe that to be the case anymore.   I did call my local Kia dealer and he was shocked to hear what happened.  He did not say he had any experiences like this.",

The car did continue to drive, but only at about 35 mph.  I was luckily very close to a rest station on the New Jersey Turnpike.  And as I was coming up to a toll, the rest of the traffic was slowing down.  If this had happened a few miles later, I certainly could have been in an accident as I slowed down and the rest of the cars would have continued to speed by.  The car was towed to my Kia dealer as the check engine light was flashing and I did not want to drive it there due to the distance I was from the dealership.  Their analysis found that cylinder #1 fuel injector was stuck in an open position.  This caused the spark plug to become fowled.  Both the cylindar and the plug had to be replaced.  To date, it appears that the fix was successful.  The dealer said there was a possibility that the catalytic converter may have to be replaced if I drove too long with the fuel injector not operating correctly.  I drove approximately 2 miles.  There were not warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms before the problem.   No police or insurance company representatives involved.",

I was approximately two miles from my home so I turned on the heat at full blast to draw some of the heat from the engine to the vehicle's cabin. After checking under the hood, I noticed the coolant level was below normal and based upon that observation, drove it to a nearby auto repair and service location for further review. Two days later, ! was informed that a gasket on the coolant side of the engine had failed and an engine replacement was necessary. They further suggested I contact my dealer to determine whether the engine replacement would be covered under warranty or was part of a recall.  After contacting my local Kia dealer (the largest Kia dealer in Virginia), I arranged to have it towed to them to have a full diagnostic run to determine whether the engine needed to be replace. Although our vehicle was not one of the 2016 models under the engine recall, we were told that if certain conditions were met, Kia America would replace the engine at no cost as it would be covered. After having our vehicle for four (4) weeks, our dealer confirmed the engine gasket failure (on the coolant system side), that it was a manufacturer defect and requested Kia America replace at no cost to us. Our dealer confirmed that all service (including oil changes and schedule maintenance) was performed by them from the time of purchase (showroom floor new; bought car with 5 miles on it) while the car was under warranty (up to 100K miles) and the service was up to date. With that information, Kia America denied the request for the engine replacement.",

The vehicle had a recent oil change before the software update and a multipoint inspection with the software update.

My check engine light started flashing and the vehicle went into Limp Mode.  I contacted the Kia headquarters (July 23,2021). My Sorento was towed to ALM Kia in Union City, GA where it sat for 10 weeks waiting for them to evaluate the vehicle.  I moved my Sorento to Rick Case Kia for evaluation and repair on October 13.  They change the spark plugs and topped of the oil.  However, it was consuming oil at a rate of 3-1/2 quarts every 1000 miles.  The Kia Dealership is reluctant to fix the engine of my 2016 Kia Sorento, and the service advisor at Rick Case Kia said make sure to keep oil in the engine.  I did that faithfully.      Since then I\u2019ve had the EVAP system evaluated, replace the gas cap, the canister purge valve, and added 15 quarts of oil.  After all that, my Sorento\u2019s engine failed on December 16, 2021 on I75 in Atlanta GA.  I had the vehicle towed to Nalley KIA in Stonecrest Georgia.  They diagnosed the Head Cylinder as the problem and said it was not covered by KIA extended warranty.   I also have \u201cMY WARRANTY FOREVER\u201d as a second protection product.  The service manager at Stonecrest KIA contacted My Warranty Forever to open a case with them.  One of the requirements from My Warranty Forever was for Stonecrest Kia to send them pictures of the parts that failed.  They would cover the labor cost of breaking down the engine to obtain the pictures if the defects were covered under the warranty if not I would be responsible for the labor cost.   The service manager at Stonecrest KIA said his tech was out but he had four certified technicians next door at his Hyundai dealership to do the work.  I authorized obtaining the pictures however at this time nothing has not been done.  The warranty company is still waiting for the pictures.  In the meantime I have run out of money to rent cars to get to and from work.",

The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) began to blink continuously. The first opportunity for an exit navigating through the construction zone, with the vehicle rapidly failing, was taken and the dealer, Ourisman Chantilly of Virginia, was contacted immediately. This confirms that the Kia Motors America, Inc. Product Improvement Campaign for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Knock Sensor Detection System (KSDS) was installed on January 12, 2019, with a mileage reading of 13,726 in the Commonwealth of Virginia at Ourisman Chantilly of Virginia. The NHTSA Recall ID: 18V907000 for the high-pressure fuel pump leakage, Kia recall number SC172, includes 2012-2017 Sorentos. This could be a major fire hazard and pose a serious threat for injury or death. This vehicle has no safety recalls with the NHTSA; the list of affected Sorento 2016 VINS excludes my vehicle. This dangerous defect of engine failure in a well-maintained, low mileage vehicle sold to me as a five-star safety rated \"Pre-Delivery Inspection\" (PDI) certified with no mechanical issues and examined as safe, may have had the apparent defects from the purchase date with the mileage delivery of nine (9).",

        "summary": "There are two major issues with my 2016 Kia Sorento LX (that I\u2019ve just bought less than a year ago).  1- There seems to be some sort of electrical problem going on as my radio and headlights randomly go off when driving. While driving at 70 mph on the interstate AT NIGHT, my headlights when off and I couldn\u2019t see anything! Thankfully I was able to get them back on because I had my children in the car with me. This could have caused us to drive right off the road or worse, hit/be hit by another vehicle. Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to get this looked at due to a bigger issue at hand. Which brings me to\u2026 2- The most expensive and frustrating issue. The engine has seized up, which has been confirmed by a local service center. I have kept up the maintenance on my vehicle since I got it at the beginning of this year. Regular oil changes with full synthetic oil. While driving, again on the interstate, RPM jumped over 4 then down to 0, oil and battery lights came on, and vehicle was disabled. Waited 3 weeks to have it looked at to find that I\u2019m just out of luck. Vehicle is not covered under warranty and there seem to be no open recalls, which I don\u2019t understand given this is a painfully common issue with these models. So I either get to foot the $7,000+ bill for a new engine (which I can\u2019t afford) or continue paying for a vehicle that I can\u2019t even drive. To say that I am dissatisfied with my KIA would be a GREAT understatement.",

I got to the shoulder of the interstate and my car was making a terrible knocking noise. I have owned this car for 3 months. There is a little over 87K on my car. I had the car towed to the nearest Kia dealership where I was told my engine was totaled. After paying 140.00 for a diagnostics report and being without a car for a whole month (keep in mind this is just for the report). I was quoted a total of 6,800 for them to fix my car. After further research I have found other people with the same issues with the engine. My engine is a 3.3L V6. In the previous lawsuit for Kia it only covers 2.4L engines where my engine is having the SAME issues. I should not have to pay for a new engine when this is a big issue with other consumers with the same car and engine type. Now im stuck paying on a car I CANT DRIVE until the 6800 is paid. I owe to much on my car for me to pay it off in full. This put me as well as everyone else on the interstate at risk and would have also put my children at risk if they were in the car. I am beyond irritated. As well as a given a whistleblower just coming out to state that these engines are not safe and kia and hyundai's neglect in keep their consumers safe.

That wasn't my problem.  I contacted another Dan O'Brien Kia dealership in Norwood MA, and found that one of the problems that might have caused my car to malfunction was a safe recall that was not made and therefore I lost my warranty. But I went to Kia several times and they always said they didn't have the parts to recall.  In the document it says that my car would have the rod bearing warranty if it were failing.  Asking another dealership he explained to me if when I presented the oil consumption problem on 07/23/2021 the part could already have problems.  What are the symptoms of a bad rod bearing: Low Oil Pressure - Many times when a bearing is beginning to fail (or has failed), you will noticed signs of decreased oil pressure. This is usually more evident upon first starting the vehicle. In many cases, a bad rod bearing will lead to a \"check engine oil\" light being displayed on the dash. (Problems that were happening in my car when I was at Kia on 07/23/2021).  Another explanation that the dealership gave me is that my car was showing excessive oil consumption and burning of oil and a problem that may have been caused by the defect of the part of the safe recall (E-CVVT COVER AND MOTOR PLUG REPLACEMENT) that was not made, which as a result occurred the Misfire and the cylinder lost compression.  E-CVVT Cover defect could cause Late valve timing will keep the intake valve closed too long after the intake stroke has started, and will increase the vacuum in the cylinder. The high vacuum will have a tendency to suck oil up past the piston and rings into the upper part of the cylinder where it will be burned.",

A case was opened and the contact was awaiting a call back from the manufacturer. The vehicle was not repaired. The approximate failure mileage was 115,000. The service manager at Matthews Kia said he was replacing seven engines per week and that this was a manufacturers defect from the factory that affected early 2016 models. He also said that the defect normally occurs between 100,000 miles and 120,000 miles, just as the vehicle goes out of warranty. Consumer purchased an enhanced warranty at the time of purchase of the automobile. There were no warning lights or codes thrown when engine failed.

I was told, \"run the car till the engine dies and Kia will replace it.\" Once at the dealership Kia performed a connecting rod bearing test but stated it was unable to be completed due to cylinder two failing. They pulled the head and found the exhaust valve to cylinder two had a piece missing. This was sent to Kia elevated claims through consumer affairs who advised me it would not be covered. They stated the exhaust valve likely broke due to carbon build-up. I explained the carbon build-up was due to burning oil which was likely caused by a worn connecting rod bearing. I was told burning oil would not cause carbon build-up and they would not do a good faith repair on my vehicle. I contacted the service manager of the dealer and explained this. He stated the consumer affairs person was not correct and these items were linked. I contacted Kia consumer affairs supervisor and explained my situation again, stating the service manager at the dealership would like to speak with him. He denied my claim again and stated he would \"absolutely not speak with the service manager.\" He told me to refer him to a district manager and still denied any issues with Kia relating to oil consumption causing this engine failure.",

First, I checked the oil level and the dip-stick was bone dry and discolored from the heat of the engine.  I then jacked the vehicle up placed it on jack stands removed the engine splash shield to better access the underside of the engine. After careful inspection I was not able to ascertain where the oil may have been coming from. I went to YOUTUBE and found numerous video's detailing the issue with the Sorrento models from 2010-to-2016. Turns out it is the 'OIL PRESSURE SENSOR\u201d about $14.00 in replacement parts; mechanic verified. The issue which has been stated in the YOUTUBE videos and on the NHTSA website and numerous other websites; the vehicle engine will fail from excessive oil loss and the \"WARNING LAMP\" will not ILLUMINATE to alert you of the low oil level prior to the vehicle losing power and the engine failing. This can be a safety hazard if this occurs on the highway, which I have read other complaints and it has happened luckily no one was injured or killed. It should not cost you $400 in repair cost to replace a part that cost $14.00. If you don\u2019t catch this issue in time and the engine fails that same $14.00 part will cost you $6100 for an engine replacement. This is an issue that KIA has been aware of for over 7 years that has not been addressed. This should be #1 on the NHTSA RECALL list.",

Moving forward to July the TPMS light stayed on and the check engine light came on and vehicle began to sputter.  We took it to our mechanic and he diagnosed that we needed a new engine.  There was sludge build up, knock sensor codes came up, miss fires on bank 1, and internal engine noise. We had the vehicle towed to our dealer Tempe Kia.  They concurred that a new engine would be necessary. Many codes were found P0300, P0306; P0304; P0302; P0018. Had a conversation with Debby 10:00 a.m. for 55 minutes 7/20/21from Kia and was told that due to lack of maintenance on the vehicle that Kia would not cover this engine under warranty. We were told that our oil changes were out of the time frame that Kia specifies in the owners manual that the 2016 Kia Sorento should have an oil change every 7,500 miles.

I turned the car off and then tried to crank it and the only sound was a squeal, but no start up. I crossed the remaining 3 lanes on foot while carrying my son since it quickly got up to 95+ degrees in the car and we had to wait for a ride. I attempted to start the car again and battery was dead. After getting a jump, it started up with a squeal and clanking sound. I called to get a tow truck.   My Sorento is currently sitting in the parking lot at home and when started it makes a terrible squeal and when the accelerator is pushed there is a terribly loud clanking sound as if something is loose banging around on the inside. It gets worse as the game is pushed.  This was a very hectic and unsafe situation for us both, not to mention we missed the therapy appt for my son and we also missed leaving for vacation the following day because we currently have no automobile. I have cancer and next week I am scheduled to have a major surgery to hopefully remove it and now I have no transportation.   I am contacting a KIA dealership to see what my options are.

        "summary": "I purchased a new 2016 KIA Sorento Tow Package that stated on the invoice it included a Mobius part number C6061 ADUS9 (Tow Hitch Harness) \u2013Sorento.  They part failed June 2019 and was reported to the KIA Kearny Mesa dealership. They initiated a request for the part and it was not received to date.   The KIA Customer Care Irvine center said the vehicle was not listed as having the part and therefore I was not entitled to the KIA internal recall SC142. (Google search C6061 ADUS9) Their explanation was the VIN didn't include the Mobius part number C6061 ADUS9. I emailed a copy of the purchase invoice that showed otherwise.   Please force KIA to update their build database to include purchased options.   This is the second time I have submitted this Safety Recall.   Consumer would like to provide an update complaint number 11390630 with 11420441. Essentially the PROBLEM is KIA customer service will not honor its INTERNAL RECALL SC142 with consumer's vehicle and suspect they won't honor others with the same issue. The sell their new vehicles in California without a Trailer Brake controller and defective CLASS III tow hitch harness. Mobius part is C6061 ADUS9 (Tow Hitch Harness) \u2013 Sorento",

Well on 4/28/2021 I am driving my vehicle home and I started smelling coolant so I am 1 1/2 miles from my house so drive it in and the temp gauge is now at Hot. I call towing company and have it towed to a KIA dealership 90 miles from me because no one in my town services KIA not has the equipment to put on the KIA to run report. The Kia dealership tells me that the bolts has backed out and and caused a head gasket to blow . They recommend a new engine which none are available because all being refurbished so all they can do is redo the bolts and rehex but they do not warrant their work because it\u2019s not recommended approach . I am not original owner so the 10 yr:/100,000 mile power train does not apply and the 5/60,000 does not apply because it has 80,000mikes. I had purchased Carshield but they refuse to cover the cost because they say the head and gasket plus the reboring the holes and rebolting not part of the internal mechanism so they refuse to pay. So issues with the 3.3L V6 GDI are faulty and KIA is aware. I wAnt someone to make KIA put this on a emergency recall and need engine replaced with a new one and KIA needs to make it right immediately while it\u2019s still in shop and been there over 3 weeks because I have been arguing with KiaCustomer Affairs, Carshield and all the other levels . We need to file a class action lawsuit . All Kia says we report the the issues but nothing gets done . I will never purchase another foreign vehicle or definitely not a KIA because any company that won\u2019t stand behind the piece of crap power train needs to be put out of business . If they can cover 100,000 miles for original owner then they could make it a standard regardless if someone is 2nd or 3rd owner. 100,000 miles should be 100,000 miles regardless but KIA makes another excuse to avoid responsibility. Dealer said the new engines to fit vehicle which 3.1 liter V6 mid because all are being refurbished so that proves that a problem with this size Engine. Consumer is letting bank repo the vehicle.",

The dealership stated my head gasket needed to be replaced. 2 weeks after Kia replaced, I had a routine oil change at my local mechanic who regularly performs maintenance. He contacts me and has me come down to show me he did not want to do the oil change as he noticed that the gasket had not been changed as I had claimed it was when i dropped it off earlier in the day. He agreed to order the parts and when replaced gave me the parts which could not have possibly been new. I called Smithtown Kia reporting a complaint at paying nearly $500 and no repair was made to my car. At which, I was told there is an issue with the engine of my car as they received a \u201cwarning notice\u201d from corporate. They explained I would likely need to replace the engine. They refused to refund my money for a repair not made. On 5/7/21, I was traveling to Delaware and on the NJ turnpike traveling at highway speed in the left lane, the engine decelerated and warning lights appear saying engine failure service required. Nearly being hit by cars traveling behind me and subsequently attempting to move to the shoulder was almost hit by 2 commercial trucks. A frightening experience and left stranded. The car was towed to a local mechanic who indicated the car needs to be towed to Kia as the engine is not performing. Having to wait until Monday, my car was towed to the nearest dealership In Delaware. I\u2019m currently without a vehicle and waiting for the dealership to diagnose the issue. I\u2019ve been told the service department will likely assess the car in 3-4 weeks due to all the engine failures they are addressing. The incident was traumatic for myself and my passenger, we could have been killed. My vehicle has always had oil changes, Car Fax and all my receipts can attest to my adherence to the maintenance of my vehicle.

THIS ENDS UP BECOMING A SERIES OF CONSTANT CORRECTIONS FROM INADVERTENTLY OVERSTEERING. THIS IS VERY FATIGUE INDUCING AND CAN BE FRUSTRATING, EVEN WHEN I AM VERY WELL RESTED AND ALERT. I'M CONCERNED IT'LL AFFECT OTHER DRIVERS AS THEY MAY DRIVE ERRATICALLY WHEN PASSING AS THEY MATCH MY STEERING CORRECTIONS.

THEY DROVE THE VEHICLE AND CHECKED IT OUT BUT FOUND NO PROBLEMS   I CAME HOME AND READ ON THE INTERNET REVIEWS OF KIA APPARENTLY BEING UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS.. IT BECAME MORE APPARENT WHY THE YOUNG LADY I TALKED TO ON THE PHONE SEEMED UNWILLING TO REPEAT OR DISCUSS WHAT SHE HAD TOLD ME.
