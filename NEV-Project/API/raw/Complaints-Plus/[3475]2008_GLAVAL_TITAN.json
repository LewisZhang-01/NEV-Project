THIS CAUSES EXCESSIVE SMOKE AND FUMES TO ENTER THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF THE BUS. IT HAS BEEN TO JOE BALL GMC IN PITTSBURGH FOR SERVICE INCLUDING REPROGRAMMING OF THE COMPUTER AND TWICE FOR REPLACEMENT OF EXHAUST PARTS. WHEN THE REGENERATION IS ON THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS COMPLAIN OF THE SMOKE AND FUMES. I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER REGARDING THIS CONCERN. *TR",
