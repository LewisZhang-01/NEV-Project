THEY RECOMMENDED THAT WE TAKE ANY THINGS OFF OF THE KEY RING OTHER THAN THE KEY WHEN IN DRIVE. I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE ISSUE OF MY CAR TURNING OFF ON ITS OWN PREVIOUS TO RECEIVING THIS RECALL. BEING PROACTIVE I TOOK MY CAR TO THE WILKINS GMC BUICK DEALERSHIP LOCATED AT 6913 RITCHIE HIGHWAY, GLEN BURNIE, MD 21061 IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RECALL SERVICED.

ONCE THE RECALL FIX WAS COMPLETED I LEFT AND A WEEK LATER HAD THE ISSUE OF THE CAR TURNING OFF WHILE DRIVING OCCUR. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE KEY TO ENSURE THE FIX WAS PROPERLY DONE, THEY INFORMED ME IT WAS PROPERLY DONE AND NO NEED TO COME IN. I THEN CALLED GM CORPORATE AND WAS TOLD THEY HAVE NO RECALL ON THE IGNITION PART (THE REAL PROBLEM) AND THE KEY SHOULD HAVE FIXED THE ISSUE.

MY SON WAS DRIVING TO FOOTBALL PRACTICE THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT ON WHILE TURNING A CORNER, IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN. A CLASSMATE WITH HIM, AND TOGETHER THEY HAD TO TURN THE CAR (ALMOST WRECKING THE VEHICLE). I WENT TO GET THE CAR AND CHECKED THE FLUID LEVEL, THERE WAS NONE IN THE PUMP. I PUT SOME IN AND CHECKED UNDER THE CAR. POWER STEERING FLUID WAS POURING OUT UNDER THE DRIVER'S SIDE. AFTER FILLING IT AGAIN, THEY POWER STEERING WORKED FOR ONLY A MOMENT OR SO, SCREECHING AT THE SAME TIME AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, IT NO LONGER WORKED. I THOUGHT IT WAS A BUSTED POWER STEERING HOSE. MY WIFE TOOK IT TO THE SHOP, THEY PUT IT UPON THE RACK AND WE WERE TOLD IT WAS THE RACK AND PINION THAT WENT OUT. THAT IT WOULD COST AROUND $700 TO REPAIR IT. THE CAR IS IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIRS AS I AM TYPING THIS - MILEAGE IS AROUND 67,500 - PROBLEM INITIALLY BEGAN (PER MY WIFE AND SON) A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SO AGO. I DO NOT DRIVE THAT VEHICLE, OTHERWISE I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE PROBLEM MUCH SOONER. THERE ARE SEVERAL BUICK VEHICLES BUILT ON THE SAME TYPE OF PLATFORM AS OUR 2005 BUICK LACROSSE THAT HAVE RECALLS. WHY IS THERE NOT A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE THE PROBLEMS APPEARS TO BE ACROSS THE BOARD? ALMOST ALL THE COMPLAINTS I RESEARCHED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH BUICK LACROSSE IS A REPEAT OF WHAT OTHERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT. BUICK (GENERAL MOTORS) SHOULD ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DEFECT - YES I SAID DEFECT.\" IT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM AND WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE FORCED TO ADDRESS IT. MY BOY ALMOST HAD WRECK BEHIND IT AND GENERAL MOTORS/BUICK WON'T FIX IT UNTIL SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. ENOUGH SAID.  *TR",

I SPOKE WITH DENNIS FROM COMMUNITY ON MAY 11 2011 AND I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A P/S STEERING FAILURE AND THE HOSE AND PUMP WOULD NEED REPLACED. \"AROUND $900.\" WAS WHAT I WAS QUOTED. I AGAIN SPOKE WITH BRIONNA ON MAY 11 AND SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A DISTRICT REP IN CONTACT WITH ME ONCE HE COMPLETED HIS INVESTIGATION. I SPOKE WITH LARRY ON MAY 11 WHO ASKED SOME QUESTIONS AND TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH ME. THE ENTIRE TIME THE CAR SAT AT THE GM DEALER I RECEIVED 2 CALLS A DAY ASKING ME TO AUTHORIZE THE REPAIR. I STATED THAT GM WAS INVESTIGATING THIS ISSUE AND THEY SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THEM. DENNIS SAID NO ONE FROM GM HAS TOLD US THEY WILL FIX THE CAR. AS SUCH ON 5/12/2011 I DID GO PICK THIS CAR UP. PLEASE NOTE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THIS CAR AWAY. THE FAILURE IS NOT A COMPLETED FAILURE.",
