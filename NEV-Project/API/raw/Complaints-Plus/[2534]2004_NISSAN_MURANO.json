I COULD KILL MULTIPLE INNOCENT PEOPLE BY DRIVING MY CAR. I PURCHASED THIS CAR USED ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. I'VE CHECKED FOR RECALLS AND THERE'S NOT A RECALL FOR THIS PREVIOUS CAUSE. IT DOES IT ALL THE TIME ON ANY ROAD. CAN YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SITUATION FOR ME? IT HAS DONE THIS SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR",

NISSAN REFUSES TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS A BIGGER PROBLEM AND THE EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SITUATION THAT IS HAPPENING. IF THE SUB FRAME WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE MY SON, MYSELF AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHO ELSE ON THE ROAD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED BY CAR PARTS FLYING ALL OVER THE ROAD. I DO NOT HAVE PICTURES OF THE CAR BUT THE MECHANIC KNOWS AND IT HAS TAKEN HIM A MONTH TO FIX MY CAR (STILL DON'T HAVE IT BACK) AND A 3500.00 PRICE TAG ON THE REPAIRS.",

WE EXPLAINED THAT WE DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING DIFFERENT WHILE DRIVING. MIKE (SERVICE GUY) TOLD US THE 2004 MURANO HAS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH TRANSMISSIONS FAILING, AND NISSAN HAS SINCE REDEVELOPED THE CVT TRANS, AND SHOULD BE REPLACED. AND THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRING AT 80,000 MILES, AND WOULD NOT BE COVERED ANY LONGER. WE WERE RELUCTANT, BUT AFTER SPEAKING FURTHER WITH MIKE, AND NOW FEELING SCARED THAT MY WIFE WILL BE STUCK SOMEWHERE WITH A BROKEN TRANS, WE DID RELUCTANTLY LET NISSAN DO THE REPAIRS. OUT OF FEAR OF FUTURE FAILURE. SHORTLY AFTER, NISSAN EXTENDED THE TRANS WARRANTY TO 120,000, OR 10 YEARS.  NOW, THE MURANO HAS JUST UNDER 137K, AND THE TRANSMISSION BROKE WHILE MY WIFE WAS ON THE FREEWAY, AND ONLY BY MY WIFE'S QUICK THINKING, DID SHE AVOID A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER CAR. THE WHOLE CAR SHUTS DOWN, EVEN IF YOU PRESS THE GAS DOWN TO THE FLOOR. NOTHING HAPPENS. SHE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR, AND SLOWLY (5MPH) MOVE OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY.

NOW I FOLLOW DON'S ADVICE AND TOP OFF BOTH ENGINE OIL AND POWER STEERING FLUID EVERY WEEK. NOT THE BEST ANSWER, BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.  *TR",

THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE I AM A SINGLE WOMAN AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCK AND UNLOCK MY DOORS AS NEEDED.

IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND ALMOST $1000 AND STILL NOT HAVE FUNCTIONING DOOR LOCKS!!! I KNOW FOR A FACT THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE SOLENOIDS IN THE DOORS THAT CONTROL THE LOCKS BECAUSE MY REPAIR SHOP TESTED EACH ONE IN EACH DOOR AND THEY ARE PROPERLY FUNCTIONING, WHICH IS WHAT LED US TO CHECK THE BCM. WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THE BCM WAS BAD, I HAD THAT REPLACED BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE!!!  *TR",

I BOUGHT THE CAR WITH 100,000 KMS ON IT SO I WAS QUITE WORRIED AS I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD A NEW TRANSMISSION AT SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, ESPECIALLY ME. NOT LONG AFTER THAT, NISSAN CAME OUT WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE CVT'S BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH EVERY MURANO OWNER HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT SOONER OR LATER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IM AT 160,000 KMS ON IT RIGHT NOW AND SURE ENOUGH, IM HAVING BIG PROBLEMS NOW. A HUGE KNOCKING NOISE IS COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION THAT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE A HELICOPTER TAKING OFF. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE FOR SOME TIME NOW, WHEN I'VE BEEN AT A STOP LIGHT, I CAN LITERALLY PUT THE GAS PEDAL DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WILL BE NO RESPONSE FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS, THEN THE CAR WILL JOLT FORWARD. MY MURANO IS AT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE TELLING ME THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM THE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL AND THAT THEY WON'T COVER IT UNDER THE NEW WARRANTY. THE DIFFERENTIAL IS INSIDE OF THE TRANSMISSION AND THEREFORE PART OF IT, YET THEY WON'T COVER IT. SO RIGHT NOW IM PRETTY MUCH AT THE POINT WHERE I NEED TO GET RID OF THIS THING ASAP AND GET SOMETHING ELSE. IF NISSAN REFUSES TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE WITH THIS WORLDWIDE PROBLEM, UNFORTUNATELY IM GOING TO HAVE TO TURN MY BACK ON NISSAN FROM HERE ON OUT WHICH IS REALLY TOO BAD, BECAUSE THIS IS THE 3RD NISSAN I'VE HAD WITH ONLY MINOR ISSUES UNTIL NOW. THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROBLEM IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR ME TO NEVER BUY A NISSAN AGAIN. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

THE VEHICLE HAS PERFORMED GREAT OVER THE YEARS; HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE NISSAN MURANO WHICH IS THE DRIVER'S SIDE SUN VISOR. AS YOU ARE DRIVING, THE SUNVISOR WILL DROP DOWN BLOCKING THE VIEW OF THE ROADWAY.  I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN WITH ANOTHER NISSAN MURANO OWNER WHO STATED THAT SHE HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. ALSO, I RAN AN INTERNET SEARCH FOR \"PROBLEMS WITH A NISSAN MURANO SUNVISOR\" AND DISCOVERED NUMEROUS BLOGS SUBMITTED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR NISSAN MURANOS. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE SOMEONE IS VERY SERIOUSLY INJURED OR PERHAPS KILLED BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE THE ROADWAY.  *TR",

WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS IT'S IMPERATIVE NOBODY CAN GAIN ACCESS AT WILL BY WALKING UP TO THE CAR. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.  2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE.

SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. AND THE MURANO'S DESIGN IS SUCH THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO COMPREHEND IF IT'S NOT YOUR CAR, FOR INSTANCE A RENTAL CAR. I CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE CONFUSED HOW TO UNLOCK A DOOR USING THE MANUAL LEVER IN AN EMERGENCY WHEN THEY VIRTUALLY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS.

IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.  2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.    THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITTENT OF OPERATION. SOMETIMES THE DOORS LOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T. IN ADDITION, SOMETIMES THE DOORS UNLOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T.    3. IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. AND THE MURANO'S DESIGN IS SUCH THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO COMPREHEND IF IT'S NOT YOUR CAR, FOR INSTANCE A RENTAL CAR. I CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE CONFUSED HOW UNLOCK A DOOR USING THE MANUAL LEVEL IN AN EMERGENCY WHEN THEY VIRTUALLY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES.

I RESOLVED TO IGNORING IT AND JUST PUSHING THE BUTTON UNTIL THEY OPEN, BUT THEN THE MOST DANGEROUS THING HAPPENED (10/3/09).  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR WITH MY CHILD IN THE BACK IN HER CAR SEAT. I ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE LOCK BUTTON AND WHEN I WENT TO GET HER OUT OF THE CAR, THE DOORS WOULDN'T OPEN. I COMPLETELY PANICKED. THIS SCARED HER AND SHE GOT WORKED UP AS WELL.  PEOPLE CAME RUNNING TO HELP ME.  WE STARTED TO BREAK A WINDOW TO GET HER OUT OF THE CAR, BUT DECIDED THAT SHOULD BE THE LAST RESORT.  LUCKILY THERE WERE COOLER HEADS WORKING WITH ME. I MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IF I WAS FULLY ALONE.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP ME GET HER OUT, WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS ONE DOOR THAT I COULD PUT THE KEY IN (THE DRIVERS SIDE). SO I WENT BACK AROUND AND WAS ABLE TO OPEN THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR, CLIMB THROUGH THE CAR AND GET HER OUT OF HER SEAT.  THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN.

I PAID $3500 FOR A NEW TRANSFER CASE TO BE PLACED.  THE DAY I DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME, I NOTICED AN OIL BURNING SMELL, WHICH WAS LATER FOUND TO BE A TRANSFER CASE LEAK.

I ADVISED CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, SINCE THE VISOR FALL WHILE DRIVING, AND OBSTRUCTS THE DRIVER'S VISION, REQUIRING DRIVER TO CONSTANTLY LEAN OVER AND PUSH THE VISOR BACK UP.  I ALSO ADVISED THAT I HAVE NEVER OWNED A VEHICLE THAT HAD VISORS THAT FAILED.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE WARRANTY THAT WOULD HAVE COVERED THE VISORS HAS EXPIRED, AND THEY COULD NOT HELP ME REPLACE THEM.  I INFORMED THEM THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM.

THE NISSAN DEALER, BILL HOOD NISSAN, HAMMOND, LOUISIANA SAID THEY WOULD NEED TO REPLACE WITH A NEW TRANSMISSION...THIS ORIGINAL CHARGE WAS $4,635.  I CANNOT AFFORD THIS EXPENSE SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO HAVE THE WORK DONE THERE.  AFTER READING THE NISSAN OWNER'S WEBSITE POSTINGS, I FOUND THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF NISSAN MURANO OWNERS...SO MUCH SO, THAT I PERSONALLY BELIEVE NISSAN SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS TRANSMISSION.  I AM A VERY UPSET NISSAN CUSTOMER, AS THE NORMAL DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY IS ONLY 60,000 MILES, AND NOT THE USUAL IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 100,000 MILES.  I AM HOPING THAT BY POSITING THIS, OTHERS MAY BECOME AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE, AND THEY END UP MAKING PAYMENTS ON A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT,  -OR- PLEASE PURCHASE THE EXTENDED DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY FROM NISSAN. *TR",

IN DOING SO I AVOIDED A CERTAIN COLLISION WITH THE CAR ON MY LEFT LANE. AS THE RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, I HURT MY LEFT WRIST.

THE SYSTEM APPEARED TO BE NORMAL UNTIL THE DRIVER HAD TO EXECUTE A MANEUVER TO AVOID A ROAD HAZARD. THAT WAS WHEN THE SYSTEM FAILED, AND BY THEN IT MAY BE TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. FROM INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS FORUMS ON THE INTERNET (E.G. NISSAN MURANO AND CONSUMER REPORTS MAGAZINE, THIS PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE VERY REAL AND VERY COMMON WITH ALL 2003 AND 2004 NISSAN MURANO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE IT REPRESENTED  A CLEAR SAFETY HAZARD THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED AND FIXED BEFORE ANY LIVES WERE LOST.  *AK",

DEATH TO INNOCENT VICTIMS CAN OCCUR WITH NO COLLISION IN NEAR IDEAL CONDITIONS.  *AK SPECIFICALLY, THE DESIGN OF THE GAS TANK AND EXPOSURE TO ROAD HAZARDS IS A MAJOR SAFETY FLAW.  THE GAS TANK IS PLASTIC (NOT UNUSUAL TODAY) AND OPEN TO OBJECTS THAT CAN FLY OFF THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL.  THE FRONT OF THE GAS TANK IS OPENLY EXPOSED, WITH NO PROTECTION TO PREVENT THE PUNCTURE OF THE GAS TANK, UNKNOWING TO THE DRIVER, LEADING TO POTENTIAL DEATH. MY PARTICULAR INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE TURNING LEFT THROUGH AN INTERSECTION.  I HEARD A SUDDEN NOISE, LIKE SOMETHING LARGE WAS ROLLING AROUND IN THE CARGO AREA AND BANGED AGAINST THE SIDE, BUT WE HAD NO CARGO.  I STOPPED AND SURVEYED THE CAR TO FIND A PIECE OF REBAR ABOUT 2' LONG HANGING DOWN UNDER THE CAR, JUST IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT REAR TIRE.  UPON CLOSER INSPECTION THE REBAR WAS STICKING OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE GAS TANK, LEAKING GAS.  AFTER EVALUATING WHAT LOOKED TO BE A FREAK INCIDENT, ONLY 5 DAYS AFTER I BOUGHT THIS BRAND NEW CAR, IT BECAME APPARENT HOW POOR THE DESIGN WAS, SIMPLY FROM THE PLACEMENT OF THE GAS TANK, AND IT'S EXPOSURE.  I CONCLUDED THIS WASN'T SUCH A FREAK INCIDENT, GIVEN THE OPEN TARGET THE GAS TANK IS TO ROAD DEBRIS.  SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY BECAUSE OF THE POOR DESIGN UNLESS THE MANUFACTURER FIXES THIS.  IT'S SIMPLY A BAD DESIGN THAT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WITH A PIECE OF SHEET METAL TO COVER THE OPEN CAVITY UNDER THE CAR THAT MAKES THE FRONT SIDE OF THE GAS TANK A PERFECT TARGET FOR ROCKS, METAL, PARKING BERMS, ETC.    I GUARANTEE THIS WILL NOT BE THE ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE OPEN EXPOSURE TO THIS GAS TANK IN THE NISSAN MURANO.  I'M A PRETTY SAFE DRIVER, AND I'VE NEVER HAD SUCH A THING HAPPEN.  THE FACT IT HAPPENED ON THE 5TH DAY OF OWNERSHIP TELLS ME SOMETHING.  IT'S NOT JUST BAD LUCK, IT'S A BAD DESIGN FROM A SAFETY POINT OF VIEW.",
