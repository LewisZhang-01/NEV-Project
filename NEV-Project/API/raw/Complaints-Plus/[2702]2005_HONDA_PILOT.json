VSA activation indicator triangle light came on, as well as, the VSA system indicator light.  Have experienced the event a dozen or so times on both the interstate and roads with a speed limit of 35/40 mph, without use of the cruise control.  We are original owners of the vehicle and it has been diligently worked on throughout & currently has 230,000 miles on it.  Awaiting delivery of a new vehicle, but intend for my newly licensed son to drive the vehicle.  Took it to my repair shop, but they couldn't replicate the issue.  Replaced both front speed sensors, but the issue occurred on the interstate drive home immediately after.  Hope to be able to drop the vehicle off for an extended period once I take delivery on my new vehicle.  Worried the issue will occur in rain or snow & be even more dangerous.  Repair shop ran diagnostic showing the yaw issue, but said the Honda generated code report only went up to 25 mph. Has always pulled to the right during activation and the grinding noise is very evident & startling. Kinda feels like maybe the ABS anti-braking system engages on 1 tire for a brief few seconds in my non auto mechanic analysis.",

The car has 137,000 miles on it and has not been in an accident and the light came on immediately when I started my car after it sat for a day without driving it. I live in rural area where no one could have tampered with my car. The dealership was perplexed and said they have seen this happen a lot recently and believe it is a defect in the SRS unit. The impact sensors are fine but the codes are being thrown for impact sensors, not the SRS unit; which they said if I paid 1,000 dollars (might) resolve the impact sensors error... if not, then I would have to pay another 900 for parts/labor to do the sensors as well. THIS IS A MANUFACTOR DEFECT THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS I CALLED MANY DEALERSHIPS AND THEY THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE WARRANTIED AS A SAFETY HAZARD... Honda will not yet acknowledge that me or my family could be killed because their computer SRS unit malfunctions.

STARTED OUT HAVING THE VSA TRIANGLE LIGHT ON DASH AND LOSING POWER (LIMP MODE) ONLY AFTER COMING OUT OF A TURN AFTER DRIVING VEHICLE FOR AWHILE.

DRIVING AT 55 MPH, THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH TO THE BRAKES CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO HARD BRAKE, CAUSING A SWERVE AT LEAST GOING THAT FAST.

ADDITIONALLY, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A NOTICE ON MY 2010 HONDA ACCORD (PURCHASED FROM A HONDA DEALER), WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE NOTICE, IS PART OF THE CLASS OF VEHICLES SUBJECT TO THE SAME EXTENDED WARRANTEE.  HONDA'S NATIONAL SERVICE CENTER COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE MISTAKE OCCURRED AND COULD NOT ASSURE ME THAT THEIR RECORDS WOULD BE CORRECTED FOR PURPOSES OF SAFETY NOTIFICATIONS SINCE HONDA HAS HAD MY INFORMATION CORRECT IN THEIR SERVICE CENTER DATABASE.     SECOND ISSUE:  MY NOTICE OF AN EXTENDED WARRANTEE ON 2008-2010 ACCORDS IS FOR A CORROSION ISSUE WITH AN INTERNAL COMPONENT IN THE SRS ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNIT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SRS FAILURE.

HONDA SAID IT IS NOT COVERED, BUT THEY WOULD DIAGNOSE IT FOR $120/HR + REPAIRS.

TODAY (A WEEK LATER) I'M GOING ABOUT 25 ON A SURFACE STREET AND THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED, SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND POSSIBLY CLEARING ANY CODES. WHAT THEY CAME BACK WITH WAS A FAULTY YAW SENSOR CODE, BUT THEY WANT TO KEEP IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH. I'M TOLD IT IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN COMPUTER AND IF IT IS THE YAW SENSOR THEN THE MAIN COMPUTER HAS TO BE REPLACED, AT A COST OF $1650.00 (THEY WILL CREDIT TOWARD THE REPAIR THE $125.00 I PAID LAST WEEK FOR THE NON-ANSWER). IN READING ONLINE, I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD THIS ISSUE.

A VSA LIGHT DIAGNOSTICS WHICH I INDEPENDENTLY PAID FOR INDICATED A YAW RATE FAILURE CODE (25-01).

THE VSA LIGHT WENT ON AFTER THE EVENT OCCURRED.    CALLING THE HONDA DEALER TODAY, THE SERVICE MANAGER INDICATED THAT HONDA DOES NOT HAVE A RECALL ON THIS MATTER ONCE THE PART FOR THE 13V-092 RECALL WAS REPLACED.

IN THE MEANTIME, A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WORKS IN THE AUTO REPAIR INDUSTRY USED HIS COMPUTER TO PULL THE CODES AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM SO WE WOULD KNOW WHAT HONDA SERVICE SHOULD BE TELLING US AT THE APPOINTMENT.  THE VEHICLE IS SHOWING AN ERROR CODE OF 42-11 FOR THE FRONT IMPACT AIRBAG SENSOR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  THIS VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE SUDDEN MALFUNCTION.  UPON VISUAL INSPECTION OF BOTH FRONT SENSORS, THE YELLOW PROTECTIVE SHEATH HAS PULLED BACK FROM THE SENSOR, LEAVING THE JUNCTION WHERE THE WIRES MEET THE SENSOR EXPOSED LOW IN THE ENGINE, AND THUS CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR DEBRIS AND WEATHER TO IMPACT THEIR PERFORMANCE.  IN DOING RESEARCH ONLINE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS HONDA PILOT OWNERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG SENSORS AND HONDA IS CHARGING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO BE WIDESPREAD AMONG THIS VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AS A RECALL ITEM BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF THE AIRBAG SENSORS WILL NOT ALLOW AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT.

THIS PUZZLED ME BECAUSE WE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE OTHER THAN REGULAR MAINTENANCE LIGHTS (FILTERS, OIL CHANGE, ETC).

WE WERE HAVING A \"NOISE\" THAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY A RANDOM ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM SELF CHECK.  THIS WOULD HAPPEN AT ANY SPEED AND APPEARED TO BE ACTIVATED BY ANY SMALL BUMP IN THE ROAD.  THIS WAS MORE OF A NUISANCE THAN ANYTHING BUT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE THE DEALERSHIP LOOK INTO IT.  MORE ON THIS LATER.   IN ADDITION WE ALSO HAD THE VEHICLE STABILITY ASSIST (VSA) ENGAGE ONCE AND THE RESULTS WERE A LITTLE SCARY OR VIOLENT AT BEST.  THE PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH UNDER WINDY CONDITIONS.  THE VSA SYSTEM ENGAGED, THE BRAKES WERE HEAVILY APPLIED, AND THE VEHICLE WAS PUT INTO A CONTROL MODE THAT PULLED THE VEHICLE LEFT AND RIGHT.  WE HAD VERY LIMITED CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHEN ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING.  WE WERE ABLE TO PULL THE VEHICLE OVER WITHOUT INCIDENT AND DEACTIVATE THE VSA TO FINISH OUR TRIP.  WHAT OUR DEALERSHIP FOUND WAS A CRACKED ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ON THE MAIN ENGINE WIRING HARNESS WHERE IT CONNECTS TO THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE AND VSA MODULE.  THE CONNECTOR IS LOCATED UNDER THE ENGINE SHROUD IN AN AREA THAT ISN'T ACCESSIBLE DURING NORMAL OR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY SERVICE DONE ON ANYTHING IN THIS AREA.  OUR GUESS IS THAT IT WAS CRACKED DURING THE ORIGINAL INSTALLATION OR IT FATIGUED OVER TIME.    THE HONDA TECHNICIAN THOUGHT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS MOISTURE ENTERING THE CONTROL MODULE VIA THE DAMAGED CONNECTOR. THIS IN TURN CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT CONTROLS THE BRAKING AND VSA SYSTEM.   WE STOPPED INVESTIGATING THE REPAIR AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF COST.  IT WAS OVER $2000.00 TO GET THE HARNESS AND CONTROL MODULE REPLACED.  I WANTED TO SHARE THIS BECAUSE OF ALL THE RECENT NEWS ON 2005 PILOTS.     *TR",

AS ALMOST ALL OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOVE, WHILE DRIVING AT 35 TO 40 THE CAR STARTS TO SHUDDER AS THOUGH IT WILL TURN OFF. WAS TOLD IT'S POSSIBLY DEFECTIVE MOTOR MOUNTS.  I HAVE CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR WORKS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THESE ISSUES AND THEY ESSENTIALLY TOLD ME TO 'GFY'. STATED CAR IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  *TR",

I WORKED ON IT FOR 90 PLUS MINUTES AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF THE IGNITION.  DURING THIS TIME HOWEVER, THE KEY DID NOT EVER TURN IN THE IGNITION THEREFORE EVERYTHING REMAINED \"LOCKED\".  I IMMEDIATELY TRIED THE SAME KEY ON THE DRIVERS DOOR; NO LUCK.  IT DID HOWEVER OPEN THE BACK HATCH AND THE PASSENGER DOOR, BOTH MANUALLY (THE BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED IN THE KEY, SO I WAS USING IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY UNTIL I GOT A NEW BATTERY). SO, WITH THIS INFORMATION I WENT DOWN TO LARRY MILLER HONDA, DOWNTOWN SPOKANE IN A BORROWED VEHICLE.  WHILE THERE I WAS APPROACHED BY A SALESMAN AND I EXPLAINED MY DILEMMA:  \"UNABLE TO TURN KEY IN IGNITION, THEREFORE UNABLE TO GET MY CAR MOVING AT ALL!\"..HE THEN INSTRUCTED ME TO \"SPRAY WD 40 INTO THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THE DOOR LOCKS\". AND INFORMED ME THAT THE SERVICE DEPART. WAS NOT OPEN BUT WE WENT BACK THERE BECAUSE \"THERE WERE SOME EMPLOYEES WORKING ON SOME VEHICLES.  WHEN WE GOT BACK THERE, THE SALESMAN ASKED THE SERVICE DEPT WORKER IF HE THOUGHT SPRAYING WD40 INTO MY IGNITION SWITCH WOULD WORK, THE SERVICEMAN AGREED.  SO I GOT SOME WD 40, SPRAYED AWAY AS DIRECTED, NO LUCK.  MONDAY: WENT BACK TO HONDA, WHERE ONE OF THE MANAGERS TOLD ME \"NEVER SPRAY WD40 INTO IGNITION, THIS WILL GUM IT UP...AND NOW IT WILL COST ME 600.00 OR SO TO REPLACE IGNITION SYSTEM.  HE ALSO STATED \"THEY HAVE BEEN DOING ALOT OF THESE LATELY BECAUSE OF GUMMED UP IGNITIONS ON THE PILOT.\"  I ASKED IF THIS DID NOT RAISE A FLAG FOR THEM AND POSSIBLY A PROBLEM.  HE THEN SAID I WOULD NEED TO GET A WHOLE NEW KEY, RE-PROGRAM IT AND THEN GET A NEW IGNITION SET W/ NEW KEYS AND RE-PROGRAM THEM.  I SAID THAT HONDA GAVE ME THE WRONG INFORMATION RESULTING IN DESTROYING MY IGNITION AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE RESP. MORE.  *TR",

WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE TRANSMISSION FITTINGS ARE RUSTING AWAY AND FAILING ALLOWING RADIATOR FLUID  TO ENTER THE RETURN LINE TO THE TRANSMISSION. WHEN RADIATOR FLUID ENTERS THE TRANSMISSION THE TRANSMISSION IS DONE. YOU NEED A REPLACEMENT. THESE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING TO SEVERAL HONDAS AND NISSAN. THE TWO CAR COMPANY'S USE THE SAME MANUFACTURING FOR THE RADIATOR. THE COMPANY IS DENSE. THE FAILING ON HONDAS AND NISSAN. IF YOU LOOK INTO THIS MATTER YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THIS. I REPLACED TWO RADIATORS FOR THIS TRUCK SO FAR. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM FOR $1400 SO FAR. THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THIS RADIATOR AND HONDA REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FIXED BY HONDA AND NISSAN. PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL WITH THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU  *TR",

ALSO THE PARTS ARE SO HARD TO COME BY IF YOU TRY TO GET DONE CHEAPER BY AN OUTSIDE MECHANIC. THE HONDA DEALERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE ABLE TO GET THE PARTS FASTER. THUS CREATING A MONOPOLY. I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS THOROUGHLY AND YOU TOO CAN FIND A LOT OF DISSATISFIED OWNERS THAT HAD OR HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH HONDA. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS PROBLEM WITH SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. THANK YOU.  *TT",

WHEN ASKED HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN TO A 6 YR OLD PILOT WITH ONLY 59 K MILEAGE NO ONE HAD THE ANSWER. RECOMMENDATION WAS NEW RADIATOR & 2 TRANSMISSION FLUSHES, COST $906.29. I ASKED FOR SOME KIND OF ASSISTANCE WITH THE COST OF THE REPAIR, BECAUSE OF THE YEAR, MILEAGE & ALL SCHEDULE SERVICES WERE PERFORMED @ THE DEALERSHIP.  HERE COMES THE ALABAMA SHIM-SHAM. I WAS INFORMED TO CALL HONDA OF N AMERICA. HONDA OFFERED ME $300 TOWARDS THE REPAIR COST,I SAID THE OFFER WAS UNACCEPTABLE, THEY OFFERED $450, THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.  A FEW DAYS LATER HONDA CALLED BACK OFFERING 400, I ASKED WHAT HAPPEN TO THE 450 OFFER, THEY OFFERED 450 AGAIN. I INFORMED HONDA I NEEDED AN OFFER OF 600, THEY AGREED, I'M WAITING FOR THE CHECK IN THE MAIL. 4 DAYS AFTER I TOOK THE PILOT FROM THE DEALER REPAIR SHOP THE TRANSMISSION WENT.  DEALER INFORMED ME REPLACEMENT COST WOULD BE $5200.  INFORMED DEALER I SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED BECAUSE DISINTEGRATED TRANSMISSION COOLING LINES CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.

HONDA HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE 05 PILOT TRANSMISSIONS & TRANSMISSION COOLING LINES. THEY KNOW IT BUT WON'T ADMIT IT.

INVESTIGATION:  WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A LATENT DEFECT ON CERTAIN SPARK PLUG (OR ON THE ENGINE ITSELF) IN CERTAIN HONDA PILOT. BASED ON MY RESEARCH, A SIMILAR FAILURE HAPPENED IN ANN ARBOR, MI, IN MARCH 2010 TO A 2004 HONDA PILOT. IN THAT CASE, THAT CAR HAD 58K MILES ON IT AND THE NO. 5 SPARK PLUG CAME OUT CAUSING SIMILAR DAMAGES TO THE ENGINE. I HAVE NO EVIDENCE IF THE ANN ARBOR INCIDENT HAS THE ORIGINAL SPARK PLUG OR NOT. HOWEVER, IT IS JUST ONE CASE TOO MANY FOR A MANUFACTURER WITH A VERY GOOD RELIABILITY REPUTATION.

SEVERAL CARS BEHIND HER HAD TO TAKE DEFENSIVE ACTION TO PREVENT PILING UP. VSA LIGHT AND ABS LIGHTS WERE ON. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES TO A POINT WHERE CAR WAS UNDRIVEABLE AND HAD TO BE PULLED TO SIDE OF THE ROAD. CAR WAS TOWED TO HONDA BY AAA. SAME THING HAPPENED IN OCT 2008 (ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO) BUT OCCURRED ONLY INTERMITTENTLY AND CAR COULD BE DRIVEN TO DEALERSHIP. DIAGNOSIS FROM DEALER WAS NEED FOR NEW BATTERY. ORIGINAL BATTERY WAS REPLACED AND CAR WORKED FINE UNTIL YESTERDAY. IT APPEARS THAT THE HONDA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM AT THE DEALERS CANNOT PROPERLY IDENTIFY THIS PROBLEM ALTHOUGH IT IS SURELY SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT A RECALL. ACCORDING TO MEMBERS POSTING AT HONDAPILOT.ORG FORUM, THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS AND WITH THE SAME POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS RESULTS. MORE TROUBLING IS THE FACT THAT HONDA DEALERS ARE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. SOME HAVE REPLACED TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS, SOME HAVE REPLACED STEERING WHEEL SENSORS AND OTHERS HAVE REPLACED SIDE CRASH SENSORS AND BRAKE SYSTEMS. IN MY CASE, THE DEALER REPLACED THE BATTERY. THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE THE RESULT OF MALFUNCTIONS OF ALL THESE SYSTEMS AND THE CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC CODES APPARENTLY ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PINPOINT THE EXACT COMPONENT THAT FAILED. THIS LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY ONLY COMPOUNDS THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MULTI-CAR PILEUP WHEN THE VSA SYSTEM ENGAGES FOR NO GOOD REASON. *TR",

I TOLD THE SALESMAN THAT THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE, SO WE RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND DROVE 3 OTHER '05 PILOTS ON THE LOT, ALL WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE SALESMAN AND SALES MANAGER SAID THIS WAS A RESULT OF PUTTING NEW TIRES ON ALL OF THESE VEHICLES, AND AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR A WHILE, THE RIDE WOULD SMOOTH OUT.  WELL, I SWALLOWED THIS LINE OF CRAP, HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER, AND AFTER RETURNING HOME, AND DRIVING THE PILOT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, I REPLACED THE NEW KUMHO TIRES WITH OEM GOODYEAR INTEGRITY TIRES,  AND HAD THE WHEELS BALANCED TWICE, ONCE AT HONDA DEALER, AND AGAIN AT LOCAL TIRE SHOP, WITH LATEST STATE OF THE ART BALANCING MACHINES.  AFTER ALL THIS, THE SHIMMERING AND SHUDDERING IS STILL AS BAD AS IT WAS WHEN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE HOME, AND I  CANNOT DRIVE THIS THING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET LATELY, I HAVE FOUND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PILOT OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING.

THEY DENY THE SERVICE BULLETIN 06012004-NHTSA 10014213?    SHAME ON HONDA??FORGET THE FACT THAT MY INVESTMENT IN A HONDA IS LOST, HAVE THEY CONSIDERED THE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF HANTA VIRUS?  DO THEY NOT REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CONDITION AND THE FACT THAT THE HONDA IS HARBORING RODENTS?  BEING THE VEHICLE IS #1 IN SAFETY FEATURES, IT MOST CERTAINLY WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE SAFEST WITH CHILDREN!  JUST IMAGINE, MICE IN YOUR CAR WITH YOUR BABY!THIS MATTER MUST BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.  I AM CONTACTING EVERY CONSUMER ADVOCACY SERVICE POSSIBLE TO GET THE WORD OUT.  JUST IMAGINE THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF HWY DRIVING AND SEEING A MOUSE IN YOUR CAR!  PLEASE ADV YOUR COMMENTS.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

THERE WERE A LOT OF BAD, SCARY NOISES, ONES THAT AUTOMOBILES SHOULDN'T MAKE. LUCKILY, I DIDN'T HIT ANYONE ELSE. MY THOUGHT BEFORE I GOT OUT OF THE CAR WAS THAT I TOTALLY SLAMMED INTO THE CENTER MEDIAN. HOWEVER, UPON EXITING THE VEHICLE I SAW THAT COSMETICALLY THE CAR WAS PRETTY MUCH FINE. ALL THE COMMOTION THAT I HEARD AND FELT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE AT FIRST BUT THEN IT ALL CAME TO FRUITION. IT SEEMS THAT GOING 60 MPH WITH 10-15 FEET MY CAR CAME TO A DEAD STOP, RESTING ON TWO RIGHT SIDE TIRES AND TO LEFT SIDE WHEELS. THE FREEWAY PATROLMAN WENT UP AND DOWN THE FREEWAY TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING (BECAUSE I DIDN'T!), AND ALL HE FOUND WERE PIECES OF MY CAR AND NOTHING ELSE.  AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THERE IS A LONG LIST OF MECHANICAL, BODY AND REFINISH WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND REPLACED. SO FAR AROUND 7,000+ IN DAMAGES. NOT TO MENTION THEY ARE NOT SURE IF THE TRANSMISSION AND THE FRAME ARE MESSED UP. THE REAR SUB FRAME, THE PIECE THAT HOLDS THE SUSPENSION TOGETHER, BROKE CLEAN IN HALF. WE DON'T KNOW IF THE FRONT FAILED AND CAUSED THE BACK TO FALL APART, OR IF THE BACK FAILED AND CAUSED THE FRONT TO FALL APART. TO CORRECT IT THEY ARE JUST GOING TO REPAIR EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED, MOST WHICH ARE BEING REPLACED WITH USED PARTS. THE ONLY PHYSICAL INJURY THAT OCCURRED WAS A BIG BURN/CUT I GOT FROM THE SIDE AIR BAG GOING OFF. PLUS, BY REPLACING THE PIECES WITH USED PARTS, HOW DO THEY KNOW IT WON'T FAIL AGAIN?

JUNE 6  I AM NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN A FORD HIGH-TECH REBALANCE, BECAUSE THAT WOULD SIGN ME UP FOR EXPENSIVE REBALANCES FOR THE REST OF THE LIFE OF THE CAR.

THE BELT STARTS IN THE CEALING SO FAR FORWARD THAT WHEN A PERSON WITHOUT A THICK UPPER BODY SITS IN THE CENTER POSITION IN THE 2ND ROW, THE  BELT PASSES NEXT TO THE CHEEK RATHER THAN THE SHOULDER. IN THE CASE OF A CHILD WHO IS TOO BIG TO BE IN A BOOSTER WITH A BACK BUT IS STILL RELATIVELY SMALL, THE SHOULDER BELT ACTUALLY PASSES IN FRONT OF THE SHOULDER AND DESCENDS TO THE BUCKLE WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING THE SHOULDER OR THE UPPER CHEST!   THIS LEAVES THE CHILD IN A POSITION TO HAVE HER NECK PERHAPS BROKEN OR OTHERWISE BE INJURED BY THE BELT IN THE EVENT OF A SIDE COLLISION FROM THE LEFT. MOREOVER, IT ALSO LEAVES PARENTS WITH THREE CHILDREN, SUCH AS ME, WHO NEED TO USE THE FULL CARGO AREA FOR CARGO, FACED WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE CHOICE BETWEEN PLACING THE SHOULDER HARNESS BEHIND THE CHILD'S BACK OR PLACING THE THE CHILD IN THE 3RD ROW AND ELIMINATING MUCH OF THE NEEDED CARGO SPACE.   THE HONDA SERVICE DEALER ADVISED THAT IS JUST THE WAY THE VEHICLE IS DESIGNED. HONDA CUSTOMER RELATIONS WAS EVEN LESS HELPFULL. THE REPRESENTATIVE SIMPLY SAID IT \"COMPLIES WITH ALL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS\" AND THEN REFUSED TO REFER ME TO A SUPERVISOR OR ANYONE ELSE AT HONDA HEADQUARTERS IN CALIFORNIA OR TELL ME THE PHONE NUMBER FOR HONDA HEADQUARTERS IN CALIFORNIA.  SURELY IT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RULES TO DESIGN A BELT SO THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SHOULDER AND UPPER CHEST OF A CHILD ONCE THEY ARE TOO LARGE FOR A BOOSTER WITH A BACK AND ARE THEREFORE SITTING AGAINST THE UPTIGHT PART OF THE 2ND ROW SEAT RATHER THAN BEING MOVED FORWARD BY THE BOOSTER.   HONDA NEEDS TO PLACE THE BELT ABOUT SIX INCHES FURTHER BACK ON THE CEILING OR ATTACH AN ADAPTER TO THE BACK OF THE SECOND ROW THAT WOULD COME OVER THE SEAT AND GRASP THE SHOULDER HARNESS WHEN A CHILD OR SMALL WOMAN IS SEATED IN THE SECOND POSITION.
