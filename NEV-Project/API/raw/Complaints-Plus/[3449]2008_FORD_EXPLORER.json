        "summary": "The wiring harness going into the back of what I believe is the throttle position sensor has a 180\u00b0 turn in the wiring in a very short distance.  There are four wires involved in that portion of the wiring harness. The wiring is also next to the hot, cooling system hoses coming out of the firewall. These factors caused the wiring to crack prematurely creating surges in the idle and the vehicle speed to be uncontrollable due to shorts/arcing in the electrical wiring.  An extremely dangerous situation. My daughter ran into a bullard because she started the vehicle, put it in drive, and it took off on her.    Vehicle would drive at 20 to 25 miles per hour on its own without stepping on the gas pedal.  After two or three attempts, I was able to satisfactorily fix the wiring.  Please note that the attached pictures do not show the original condition of the wiring. I attempted to use liquid electrical tape on one of my first attempts but that soon cracked as well.  You will see that in one of the photos.  I may have original pictures of the electrical wiring on my desktop computer and will gladly submit those at a later time if I can find them.  This failure in the wiring should be easy to identify in any 2008 Ford Explorer.",

I WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL FORD ENGINE AND THE 2-PIECE SPARKPLUG/CYLINDER HEAD ISSUE AND SUSPECTED THE PLUGS TO BE THE CULPRIT. I PAID THE FORD DEALERSHIP $420 TO REPLACE THE EIGHT SPARKPLUGS IN MY VEHICLE. ONLY TWO PLUGS BROKE DURING THE EXTRACTION AND THE CYLINDER HEAD DID NOT HAVE TO BE REMOVED. FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AS THEY REPLACED THE POORLY DESIGNED 3V ENGINE MIDYEAR. THEY ALSO PRODUCED A 13-PAGE TSB, SPECIAL EXTRACTION TOOL  TO REPLACE SPARKPLUGS.

HE PRETTY MUCH SAID THE SAME THING: FORD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE; IT'S AN INSURANCE ISSUE FOR YOU DO DEAL WITH.

I WAS TOLD AT 1 PM THEY WERE LOOKING INTO REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION, AS THERE WAS A PROBLEM, BUT AT 4 PM THE SAME DAY, RECEIVED A PHONE CALL STATING THAT THE REP, DEEMED IT \"WITHIN FORD SPECS.\" THE PROBLEM STILL EXITS AND IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY SPENT ON A CAR THAT DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. I CONTACTED FORD AGAIN VIA A LETTER ATTACHED TO THEIR SURVEY ON MARCH 10, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE. ONE OF THE SERVICE MANAGERS CONFIDED TO US THAT 3 OTHER EXACT PROBLEMS OCCURRED WITH THE SAME MAKE/MODEL. IT SEEMS FORD MAY BE HESITANT TO FIX THIS AS IT MAY RESULT IN A RECALL.
