        "summary": "While driving my 2020 nissan sentra, my car proceeded to brake on its own while i was depressing the accelerator. A red warning light flashed across the dash that looked like 2 cars colliding. I was able to maintain control of the vehicle, even though it was acting erratically. The braking occurred abruptly startling me and the drivers around me. Thankfully, the car did not cause a collision. The incidence scared me immensely causing my heart to palpitate and raising my blood pressure. I looked for the indicator light in my manual after I had come to a complete stop and was able to calm down after the scare. The warning was the automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection system warning light. The thing was, there were no pedestrians anywhere near my vehicle, nor were there any other vehicles or objects that could've possibly set the system off. It was clear that this system in my car was malfunction. I'm truly scared to drive my car now. I took the car to the dealer to have it looked at and fixed, however, a couple of weeks later, the same incidence occurred. This time I had my elderly mother in the car with me. She was able to witness what I had previously experienced. It scared her as well. This malfunction is going to cause unnecessary collisions that will result in harm to someone. This malfunction could easily induce an accident. It is also causing unnecessary wear and tear on vehicle due to the forceful nature of the abrupt braking. I will likely be trading this car in because the dealership cannot seem to remedy the problem. i spend a great deal of time in my car, and I cannot take the risk that this car imposes.",
