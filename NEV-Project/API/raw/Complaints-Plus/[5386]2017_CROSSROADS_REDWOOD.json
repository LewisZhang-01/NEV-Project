I CRAWLED UNDERNEATH THE UNIT AND FOUND THE SPRINGS ON THE LEFT SIDE BENT. I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD OVERLOADED THE TRAILER SO I WENT TO THE CAT CERTIFIED SCALES AND FOUND I WAS UNDER THE FACTORY SPECS BY AT LEAST 300 OR MORE LBS.  I TALKING WITH FELLOW REDWOOD OWNERS I DISCOVERED THEY HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE AND EVEN SOME THAT HAD BROKEN THAT SPRING WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT EITHER IN THE WEIGHT CAPACITY OF THE SPRINGS OR QUALITY OF THE CHINA MADE SPRINGS ON THESE UNITS. IF THESE BREAK OFF IT COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME FOR THE PERSON TOWING. MAJOR SAFETY DEFECT IN MY MIND. I AM A ASE MASTER AUTO TECHNICIAN SO I AM VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF SUSPENSIONS AND AXLES.*DT  THE CONSUMER STATED HE RECEIVED SPRINGS UNDER WARRANTY AND NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED. *TR",
