I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN AND THE TIME FOR REPLACEMENT CLOSED.  NEXT, I RECEIVED THE BRAKE RECALL NOTICE AND DECIDED TO TRY CLARKSVILLE, IN NEIL HUFFMAN HONDA.  THEY SAID THEY ONLY DID RECALLS DURING THE WEEK AND IF I NEEDED A LOANER VEHICLE TO GET BACK TO WORK...THAT IT WOULD BE $100/DAY AND THEY WOULD NEED MY VEHICLE 2-3 DAYS.  I SAID SO YOU ARE CHARGING ME FOR MY INCONVENIENCE AND THEY SAID THAT'S OUR POLICY.  SO, I LET THAT RECALL GO. HERE IT IS 2018, MY GAUGES DO NOT WORK AT ALL AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M DOING 55 SITTING STILL.  MY GAS GAUGE IS BROKE AS WELL, MY HEADLIGHTS ARE DIM AND MY FANS BOTH QUIT WORKING, PART OF THE TOP PANEL HAS FLOWN OFF--AND MY VISOR IS BROKE.  BUT,  I DID FINALLY GET HONDA WORLD, LOUISVILLE, KY TO REPLACE THE AIRBAGS AND THE BRAKE RECALL.  BUT, NO DICE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  I THINK THAT IS WRONG CONSIDERING ALL THE RECALLS ON THIS BY HONDA.  THEY WILL NOT BUDGE ON PRICE YET THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 11 RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE AND NOW I AM STUCK PAYING FOR THE GAUGES, NOT TO MENTION IF THE BRAKES HAD WENT OUT YEARS AGO...I COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OVER CLARKSVILLE NEIL HUFFMAN TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A RENTAL CAR! THANKS TO HONDA WORLD, BUT I WILL NOT RECOMMEND A HONDA TO ANYONE ELSE CONSIDERING ALL THE COMPLAINTS OVER THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, VISORS, LIGHTS,  ETC THAT I AM READING ON HERE. SHAME ON YOU HONDA!",

HOWEVER, BOTH THE QUICK START MANUAL AND THE REGULAR MANUAL BOTH INDICATE VISUALLY AND IN WRITING THAT THE FRONT SEATS SHOULD ADJUST FORWARD AT ABOUT A 10 DEGREE ANGLE FOR ACCESS TO THE BACK SEAT. \"OPEN THE DOOR, AND PULL UP ON THE SEAT-BACK ADJUSTMENT LEVER.  THE SEAT-BACK TILTS FORWARD TO ALLOW EASIER ACCESS TO THE REAR SEAT.\"  THE PICTURE ALSO SHOWS THIS TILT ANGLE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP.  THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS DESIGN CHANGE; THEY ALSO DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME CHANGE IS ON THE 2008 MODEL.  I TALKED WITH HONDA ABOUT THIS DESIGN FLAW AS A SAFETY ISSUE.  WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO TILT THE SEAT FORWARD BOTH ENTRY AND EXIT FROM THE BACK SEATS ARE RESTRICTED EVEN WHEN A FRONT SEAT IS MOVED FORWARD AS FAR AS IT WILL GO.  HONDA'S RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY KNEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE CAR AND THEY AREN'T HAVING ANY PROBLEMS GETTING IN OR OUT OF THE BACK SEAT AND THAT I SHOULD JUST MOVE THE FRONT SEATS BACK AND FORTH TO USE THE BACK SEATS.  IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, EXITING THE BACK SEAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AT BEST AND A DANGER TO THEIR SAFETY AND WELL-BEING.  HONDA'S RESPONSE IS THAT THE DESIGN IS WRITTEN IN STONE AND THAT UNLESS ENOUGH COMPLAINTS AND PROBLEMS WITH EMERGENCY EXITS ARE MADE THAT NOTHING WILL BE DONE.  THEIR OPINION IS THAT THE CAR IS SAFE AND HAS BEEN FULLY APPROVED BY THE NTSB AND NHTSA.  I WOULD DEFY ANYONE TO ENTER AND EXIT THE BACK SEAT WITH ANY SPEED BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE IN DESIGN.  I HOPE THIS WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT HONDA WILL BE FORCED TO REDESIGN AND RECALL THE MODELS THAT NO LONGER ALLOW THE FRONT SEAT TO TILT FOR AS THEY SAY \"EASIER ACCESS TO THE REAR SEAT\" AND I WOULD ADD EASY, QUICK EXIT FROM THE BACK SEAT IN AN EMERGENCY.  *TR",
