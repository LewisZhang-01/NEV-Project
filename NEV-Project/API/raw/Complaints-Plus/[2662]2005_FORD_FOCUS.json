(CONTROL ARM, BALL JOINT, CV, SWAY LINK, STEERING ASSEMBLY AND STRUTS) WE COULD NOT DETERMINE THE PROBLEM NOR COULD WE RECREATE THE 'POP' WITH THE CAR ON THE LIFT. WAS SUGGESTED THAT I HAVE MY ENGINE MOUNT BUSHINGS REPLACED WHICH IS FAIRLY CHEAP AND EASY. WHILE WAITING FOR THE BUSHINGS TO ARRIVE MY BALL JOINT 'FAILED'. IT DID NOT BREAK, IT JUST SLIPPED OUT. I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30MPH ON SECONDARY RESIDENTIAL ROAD WHICH WAS FREE OF BUMPS, DIPS, ETC. SUDDENLY I HEAR A BANG, THE CAR JERKS  AND TIRE SCREECHES. I THOUGHT IT MUST BE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM SO I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND STEER IT ONTO THE SHOULDER. UPON EXITING THE VEHICLE I SEE THE DRIVERSIDE WHEEL HAS UNATTACHED FROM THE BALL JOINT AND IS NOW KICKED OUT @ 90DEGREES. THE CV IS TORN FROM TRANSMISSION, STABILIZER LINK IS TWISTED, STRUT WAS BENT WAY BACK, TIRE HAS HOLE   WORN IN IT, SLIGHT BODY DAMAGE. I WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY THAT I HAD NOT MADE IT O THE HIGHWAY YET. THE BALL JOINT WAS NOT BROKEN IN ANY WAY; IT HAD JUST SLIPPED FROM ITS CUFF. I NOW HAVE THE BALL JOINT AND BOLT THAT HOLDS IT TO THE SUSPENSION KNUCKLE AT HOME FOR MY OWN INSPECTION.

WE CALLED GOODYEAR TO BRING IT BACK, AND THEY REFUSED; SO WE HAD IT TOWED TO ANOTHER MECHANIC. THIS MECHANIC HAS AGAIN REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND TOLD US THE SYSTEM WAS FILTHY! THE FUEL PUMP JERKED DRAMATICALLY WHEN HE'D START IT, WHICH IS WHY HE REPLACED IT AGAIN. THE COMPUTER IS STILL SAYING THE MODULE IS BAD; SO HE ORDERED A NEW ONE FROM FORD, WHO AT FIRST CLAIMED THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN TELL HIM WHERE IT WAS LOCATED; SO WHEN HE RECEIVES THE PART, HE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST NOW. WITH GOODYEAR IT ALREADY COST US $600, WHICH THEY REFUSE TO REIMBURSE. I'VE CALLED FORD, AND THEY REFUSE TO HELP SAYING THERE'S NO RECALL ON THIS MODEL. I'VE LOOKED THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM UP, AND THE FUEL PUMP AND SYSTEM HAS BEEN RECALLED ON ALL FORD FOCUSES FROM 2000-2004. MY CAR WAS BUILT IN 2004! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!

IF THE PADS ARE FROZEN, REMOVE BRAKE DISK AND PADS AND REMOVE RUST ON THE SLIDING SURFACE DOWN TO BARE METAL WITH A FLAT FILE, UNTIL PADS SLIDE FREELY. 3. LUBRICATE SURFACES WITH MOLYKOTE OR SIMILAR ANTI-SEIZE COMPOUND. 4. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REVIEW THE DESIGN WITH BRAKE VENDORS  TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WHICH COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO REPLACEMENT PADS. IF SLIGHTLY SHORTER PADS ARE THE ANSWER, THEY SHOULD INCLUDE ANTI-RATTLE MEASURES.

AS A RESULT OF THE POOR SEAT CONSTRUCTION, MY LUMBAR SPINE WAS WEDGED IN THE GAP BETWEEN THE SEAT CUSHION AND THE BACK CUSHION DURING THE IMPACT. AT THE TIME, I HAD THE SEAT LOWERED FOR COMFORT. UNFORTUNATELY, AS YOU LOWER THE SEAT, YOU ALSO CREATE A GAP BETWEEN THE SEAT CUSHION AND THE BACK CUSHION, EXPOSING THE LUMBAR SPINE TO THAT GAP. THIS IS WHERE MY LOWER SPINE WAS WEDGED AS A RESULT OF THE REAR-END COLLISION.  THE BACK CUSHION HAS TOO LITTLE SUPPORT TO KEEP THE SPINE FROM BUCKLING AND WEDGING ITSELF, BUTT FIRST. NOW, THE GAP WASN'T THAT BIG FOR ME, ONLY ABOUT AN INCH OR SO, BUT THE SEAT PADDING AROUND THE GAP IS UNSUPPORTED AND FLEXIBLE. IMAGINE NOW A REAR END COLLISION WITH A TALL PERSON SITTING IN THAT SEAT, WHERE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE GAP BETWEEN THE SEAT CUSHION AND THE BACK CUSHION, SAY MAYBE TWO OR MORE INCHES. IN A REAR END COLLISION, WITH THE FRONT BRAKES APPLIED, THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY BUCKLES UPWARD AND FORWARD, WHILE THE BODIES IN THE CAR MOVE DOWN AND BACK, AS IN MY CASE (SINCE OBJECTS AT REST [MY BODY] RESPOND ONLY AFTER THE IMPACT TO THE VEHICLE). JUST WATCH ALL THOSE DUMMY COMMERCIALS...  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD IF YOU MANIPULATE THE LEVER TO LOWER THE SEAT CUSHION. FACT: THE EUROPEAN FORD FOCUS DRIVER SEAT MOVES AS AN ENTIRE UNIT (BOTH SEAT CUSHION AND BACK CUSHION MOVE TOGETHER AS A UNIT, NEVER CREATING SUCH A GAP) FACT: THE U.S. MODEL IS THE CHEAP ALTERNATIVE TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF AN ADJUSTABLE SEAT. INSTEAD, THE LEVER LOWERS AND RAISES ONLY THE SEAT BUCKET PORTION FOR THE DRIVER, WHILE EXPOSING A GAP BETWEEN IT AND THE BACK CUSHION. THE BACK SUPPORT STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE ANOTHER FACT: ALL EUROPEAN MODELS HAVE HEADRESTS IN THE BACK SEAT ANOTHER FACT: AL U.S. MODELS HAVE NO HEADRESTS IN THE BACK SEAT.  *TR",
