Transmission temperature gauge rises quickly to 280 degrees in less than an hour of normal driving before overheating. Multiple General Motors dealers and General Motors headquarters have been unable to diagnose the problem and provide a solution despite multiple attempts and several thousand dollars in repairs including a completely new replacement transmission. General Motors first recommended the dealer to hook battery cables up to the transmission which did not fix the problem and in fact caused the vehicle to not start several times. General Motors then recommended the dealer replace the transmission entirely. Despite replacing the transmission, the same problem exists and the vehicle shifts out of gear while driving reporting an overheating transmission. Problem still occurs today 3/25/22 and vehicle becomes inoperable unexpectedly and suddenly while driving due to overheating transmission.

As I was traveling towards a heavily traveled intersection in my current city, I approached a steady red signal on the traffic light. It should be noted that this particular part of the roadway is a slight decline towards the intersection and traffic control signal. It should also be noted that on this particular day, there were no inclement weather or roadway conditions that would affect the vehicle to deviate from normal maneuvering. As I applied the brakes at a reasonable distance from the stop light, almost all pressure and power towards braking was lost. As a result, I was forced to apply extensive pressure to the brake pedal as the vehicle failed to slow and stop in a timely fashion. After gaining some braking power, the vehicle and brakes began to shake and produce a clunking sound. This was troublesome because had I failed to  stop in a timely manner, I or other motorists could have suffered serious injury or death as a result of a crash at a heavily traveled intersection. Prior to this incident, there were no warnings or alerts provided by the vehicle, dealer, or manufacturer about this issue. As the event occurred, an alert flashed on my dashboard that read \u201cService Brake Assist.\u201d Following the incident, my vehicle was inspected by a certified mechanic. Said mechanic deemed that the problem with the braking was a result of a failure of the brake booster vacuum system.  After doing some research, it is apparent that other years, makes, and models of GMC products suffered the same issue with the braking system. Said issues were remediated with a recall by the manufacturer. This defect also caused numerous vehicle crashes with reported injuries.",

I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ROAD SURFACE CAUSING THE NOISE IT WAS A LOT WORSE AT 70 MPH. THE MORE I DROVE THE WORSE IT GOT. I GOT TO LOOKING AT THE TIRES I NOTICED THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE HAD HIGH AND LOW SPOTS ON THE OUTSIDE EDGE. ON 06/27/2019 I TOOK THE TRUCK IN FOR A OIL CHANGE AND TIRE ROTATION AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT I BOUGHT IT AT, I SHOWED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE. I WAS TOLD THAT THE FRONT END WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND THEY DID ALIGNMENT ON THE TRUCK AND THEY ORDERED A NEW TIRE. I DROVE THE TRUCK A LITTLE OVER 600 MILES, I STARTED GETTING THE NOISE AND VIBRATION AGAIN. I GOT TO CHECKING THE DRIVER SIDE TIRE AND NOTICED THE SAME THING ON THE INSIDE EDGE. ON 07/24/2019 I TOOK THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER AND TOLD THEM THAT THE SAME THING IS HAPPING WITH THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE. THE NEW TIRE WAS IN AND THEY CHANGED IT. CHECK THE ALIGNMENT AGAIN AND TOLD NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE TIRES THAT THE TIRES ARE SOFT CAUSING THE WEAR. I LEARNED LATER THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES IS CALLED CUPPING. I CALLED GOODYEAR TIRE AND TALKED WITH THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM. GOODYEAR HAD ME TAKE IT TO ONE OF THEIR SERVICE CENTERS TO CHECK MY TRUCK. GOODYEAR SERVICE CENTER TOLD ME THAT THE FRONT END IS IN ALIGNMENT. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CUPPING ON THE TIRES IS A MECHANICAL PROBLEM. THEY ADVISED ME THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF I PUT NEW TIRES ON, IF I DIDN'T GET THE MECHANICAL PROBLEM FIXED. I CALLED GM ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT.

I WAS ADVISED THAT THE CLUNK AT THE RED LIGHT WAS COMMON, AS THE TRANSMISSION HAS TO RELIEVE PRESSURE.  NO WAY IS THIS NORMAL!  I GOT ON LINE TO REVIEW FORUMS AND IT APPEARS THIS IS A VERY PREVALENT ISSUE.  YESTERDAY, I LOST MY TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY ON A THRUWAY.  I HEARD A LOUD CLUNK AND THE RPMS SPIKED.  I LEFT THE HIGHWAY ASAP BUT COULD NOT GO OVER 30 MPH OR THE RPMS WOULD JUST SPIKE WITHOUT MOTION RESPONSE.  EXITING THE THRUWAY AT THIS SPEED WAS VERY DANGEROUS!  EVEN WITH HAZARDS ON, DRIVERS SELDOM SLOW DOWN OR MOVE OVER, ESPECIALLY 18 WHEELERS.  THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE CLEARLY A SAFETY HAZARD.",
