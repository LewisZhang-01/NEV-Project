LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY MANEUVER THE RV TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  THE TIRE HAD A LITTLE OVER 5,000 MILES ON IT.  THE TIRE INVOLVED IS A MICHELIN X 225/70R 19.5 XRV.  WHEN THE TIRE EXPLODED, IT TOOK OUT A SHIELD PROTECTING THE PROPANE TANK.  I THINK THE SHIELD ALSO TOOK OUT TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE PROPANE TAKE SINCE THE WIRES WERE RIPPED FROM WHERE THEY BELONGED.  A LITTLE MORE FORCE AND THE PROPANE TANK COULD HAVE BEEN HIT AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  THE WHEEL AS WELL AS THE WHEEL COVER WERE DESTROYED AS WELL.  I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST INCIDENT INVOLVING MICHELIN RV TIRES.  THIS IS THE REASON FOR WRITING THIS COMPLAINT.  ALSO, I HAVE THREE OTHER MICHELIN TIRES ON THE RV WHICH I PURCHASED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ONE THAT EXPLODED AND QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT WITH THOSE TIRES ON THERE.  *TR",
