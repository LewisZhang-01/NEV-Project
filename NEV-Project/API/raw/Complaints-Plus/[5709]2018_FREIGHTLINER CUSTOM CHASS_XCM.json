        "summary": "The contact owns a 2018 FREIGHTLINER XCM. The contact stated that the valve stem stabilizers on the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s side rear tires would dislodge without warning. The contact stated that each time he noticed that the valve stems had dislodged, he would manually adjust the valve stem stabilizers back in place. The contact had taken his motorhome to a dealer for a separate issue and was informed of a recall for NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V194000 (Tires) which was linked to the valve stem stabilizer failure. Upon leaving the dealer, the contact was informed that the recall was performed; however, the contact noticed that the valve stems were dislodged again once he returned home. Over time, the contact stated that the valve stem stabilizer on the passenger\u2019s side rear tire had rubbed against the rim which caused the tire to run flat. The contact had the tire replaced by an independent mechanic. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and stated that because a modification was made to the vehicle, they would not repair the vehicle under the recall. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 1,200.",
