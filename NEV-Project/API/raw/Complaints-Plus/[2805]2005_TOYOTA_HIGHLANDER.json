THE NEXT TIME I TRIED TO STEP ON THE PEDAL IT WAS WORKING OK. BUT THEN THE 3RD TIME I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL IT WAS GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AGAIN.  THIS WAS A SHOCKED SINCE IT GOT ME TO WORK 9 HOURS EARLIER WITH NO ISSUE. I GOT HOME AND CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID LEVEL AND LOOKED TO BE AT THE CORRECT LEVEL. I DID NOT DRIVE UNTIL NEXT DAY TO TAKE IT TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC, WHO TOLD ME IT WAS THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER. HE STATED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL LEAK INSIDE THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND NEEDED TO REPLACE THE WHOLE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER. IT STILL IS IN THE SHOP, HOWEVER I REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS \"SWAPPED OUT\" WITH A NEW ONE UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 10V499000. COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THE RECALLED FOR THE NEW PART IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING? I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN GET REPLACED AGAIN UNDER THE RECALL, OR HAVE TO PAY THE $550 FOR NEW PART AND LABOR. THANK YOU",

THIS HAPPENS PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME I ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE AFTER IT'S BEEN STOPPED OR THE SPEED SLOWED SUBSTANTIALLY.

THAT DELAY IN RESPONSE BY THE VEHICLE'S ACCELERATION HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEAR-MISSES WITH OTHER TRAFFIC.

BOTH OF THESE TIMES WERE WITHIN MY WARRANTY PERIOD, BUT IT'S OBVIOUS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE TIME & EFFORT TO DIAGNOSE THIS ISSUE. MY SAFETY WAS CLEARLY NOT IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE AT MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.

I STATED MY CONCERN TO THE MANAGER THAT I DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR WITH MY CHILDREN AND LOVED ONES. HE SAID THAT I COULD TRADE IT IN. I INFORMED HIM THAT I STILL PAY THE CAR AND HAVE A LOAN BALANCE OF $15,000.00 WITH THE BANK I AM DRIVING A RENTAL CAR AND HAVE TO PAY $19.00 PER DAY BECAUSE THE TOYOTA SERVICE MANAGER COULD NOT GIVE ME A RENTER CAR FOR LESS THAN $25.00 PER DAY.

BEAVERTON TOYOTA HAS ADJUSTED THE COMPUTER ON MY CAR SEVERAL  TIMES SINCE THE FIRST OIL CHANGE AS MY HIGHLANDER FEELS LIKE IT IS CHANGING GEARS BY ITSELF.  THE CAR HAD NOT DONE THIS UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST OIL CHANGE.  ON SUBSEQUENT SERVICE CALLS, I WOULD DISCUSS THE PROBLEM AND THEY WOULD TELL ME THAT THEY ADJUSTED THE CAR'S COMPUTER.      ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2009, I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE STORE PARKING LOT AND WAS ABOUT TO PULL INTO A PARKING PLACE BY THE FRONT OF THE STORE WHEN I HEARD A SURGING SOUND AND MY CAR QUICKLY WENT FORWARD AND SMASHED INTO A BRICK COLUMN IN FRONT OF THE STORE AND THEN IT WENT BACKWARDS AND STOPPED.  THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS SMASHED AND WAS NOT DRIVABLE.  I HAD NOT SPOKEN ON MY CELL PHONE SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE, I HAD NO ONE ELSE IN THE CAR WITH ME TO DISTRACT ME, AND I WAS NOT SPEEDING OR SWERVING TO AVOID ANOTHER PERSON OR CAR.  I THANK GOD THAT I HIT THE BRICK COLUMN IN FRONT OF THE STORE INSTEAD OF A PERSON OR ANOTHER CAR.  MY SHOULDER, NECK AND TEETH STILL HURT FROM HITTING THE BRICK COLUMN SO HARD.  I HAD JUST GOTTEN GAS, AND I HAD MY TIRES ROTATED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT.    I ASKED THE BODY SHOP WHO FIXED MY CAR AND BEAVERTON TOYOTA TO CHECK THE ACCELERATOR. AT THE TIME OF MY ACCIDENT, THEY WERE LOOKING FOR CAR MATS THAT WEREN'T PROPERLY INSTALLED.  I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG.  IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT WITH ALL THE RECALLS NOW, EVEN TOYOTA CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE ACCELERATORS.  I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A  GLITCH IN THE COMPUTER.  I CAN STILL HEAR THAT SURGING SOUND AND AM AFRAID IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT TO HAVE SURGED AND SMASHED INTO A BRICK COLUMN AS I WASN'T STOMPING ON THE ACCELERATOR OR BRAKE WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH A PARKING LOT TO PARK MY CAR.

WHILE I WAS BACK INSIDE RETRIEVING THE GROCERY LIST MY FRIEND AND I OBSERVED MY VEHICLE MOVING THROUGH HER BACK YARD AND PROCEEDED INTO THE WOODS BEHIND HER HOUSE WHERE IT CAME TO A STOP AFTER HITTING A TREE.  THIS VEHICLE SOMEHOW TOOK ITSELF OUT OF THE PARK POSITION AND INTO DRIVE!!!!   I REPORTED THIS TO MY TOYOTA DEALER AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE TOYOTA DEALER AND THE REGIONAL TOYOTA MANAGER SAID   THERE WAS NO WAY THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME ISSUE BEING INVESTIGATED (GAS PEDAL ISSUE).   I WENT AHEAD AND HAD THE CAR REPAIRED AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY PAID FOR IT (EXCEPT FOR MY $500.00 DEDUCTIBLE) WITH NO INVESTIGATION OR QUESTIONS.   I PICKED THE CAR UP TODAY AND NOW I AM HEARING ON THE NEWS THAT MANY OF THE SO CALLED GAS PEDAL INCIDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLAINED AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INCIDENTS CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY A FAULTY COMPUTER.  RIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT I ASKED THE TOYOTA DEALER/REGIONAL MANAGER SPECIFICALLY IF MY INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION.  THE ANSWER WAS NO! *TR",

WHILE THE PROBLEM DOES NOT ALWAYS OCCUR, IT IS QUITE PRONOUNCED WHEN IT DOES AND HAS RESULTED IN VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE DIRECT ATTENTION OF TOYOTA MOTOR SALES IN CALIFORNIA, AND THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN DISTURBINGLY POOR. THE TOYOTA DEALER THAT HAS BEEN SERVICING MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL, BUT APPARENTLY CANNOT TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITHOUT CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROBLEM: THE VEHICLE CANNOT ALWAYS DECIDE WHEN TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP - THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INSTANCES OF INITIAL HESITATION/LACK OF ADEQUATE POWER UPON APPLYING THE GAS PEDAL. FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE EXPERIENCED A DELAY OF A SECOND OR TWO WHEN APPLYING THE GAS PEDAL TO PROCEED. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SOME VERY CLOSE CALLS WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. ALSO, THERE ARE OCCURRENCES WHERE THE VEHICLE CANNOT SEEM TO DECIDE BETWEEN GEARS (IT WILL SOMETIMES JUMP UP/DOWN BETWEEN THE LOWER GEARS, SUCH AS 1ST TO 2ND GEAR AND/OR 2ND TO 3RD GEAR). FURTHERMORE, I HAVE NOTICED A GENERAL LACK OF ADEQUATE ACCELERATION/GAS PEDAL RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY DURING CITY DRIVING (IE. LOWER SPEEDS). MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER HAS RECORDS OF THE PROBLEM SINCE APPROXIMATELY 16,000 MILES (THE VEHICLE NOW HAS ABOUT 44,000 MILES). I BELIEVE THE ISSUE IS THE ECM, WHICH WAS REPROGRAMMED BUT THE PROBLEM RETURNED. BASED ON MY RESEARCH, I BELIEVE THE ECM MAY BE DEFECTIVE AND THAT REPLACING THE UNIT MAY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. TOYOTA WILL NOT REPLACE THE ECM. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, THE TOYOTA DEALER WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THE HESITATION PROBLEM DURING A SERVICE VISIT. HOWEVER, THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE IT LATER WITH THE SCAN TOOL ATTACHED - THEY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR TWO DAYS TRYING TO GET A SNAP SHOT BECAUSE THE TOYOTA FIELD SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD THEM \"NO REPAIRS ARE TO BE MADE UNTIL THE PROBLEM OCCURS MORE OFTEN.\"  TW*",

THE BACK PASSENGERS TIRE WAS DESTROYED. WE WERE ABLE TO CHANGE IT OUT WITH OUR SPARE. THE FRONT PASSENGERS TIRE WAS EXTREMELY LOW (1\" OFF PAVEMENT) AND HAD A BUBBLE ON THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE. IT HAD NOT BROKEN THE AIR SEAL AROUND THE RIM, AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN VERY SLOW BACK APROX .25 MILES TO AN EXIT AND RETRIEVE AIR FOR THAT TIRE. AS THE SIDE WALL BUBBLE GREW IN SIZE WE STOPPED THE AIR AT ABOUT TWENTY POUNDS. WE THEN RETURNED APROX TWENTY MILE BACK TO DENVER,  TO A DISCOUNT TIRE STORE.   WE THEN REPLACED ALL OF THE TIRES ON  OUR 2005 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER.   PRIOR TO DEPARTING ON THIS TRIP WE HAD ROTATED THE ORIGINAL TIRES AS WELL AS CHECKED AND CONFIRMED ALL AIR PRESSURES, (THE PRESSURE WAS CHECKED THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE LEAVING TOWN) WHEN CHECKING THE TIRES WE HAD HEARD A HISSING SOUND AT THE VALVE STEMS ON BOTH OF THE PASSENGER TIRES. THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST THE AIR HOSE, BUT NOW BELIEVE THAT THE VALVE STEMS WERE CRACKED AND LEAKING AIR.  I HAVE DOCUMENTED THE TIRE CONDITION AND HAVE THE ORIGINAL VALVE STEMS FROM THE TIRE STORE. THESE TIRES WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MICHELIN TIRES WITH 28644 MILE ON THEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CONDITION WAS A RESULT OF FAULTY VALVE STEMS, AND MAY BE A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN FOR OTHERS. MY TOYOTA DEALER SERVICE CENTER REFERS ME TO MICHELIN TIRE COMPANY, AND MICHELIN REFERS ME BACK TO THEM. TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY HAS DOCUMENTED A REPORT, BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE AS A CONCERN.  WE HAD THREE ADULTS - (500 POUNDS) AND THREE SUIT CASES - (150 POUNDS) AND THEREFORE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT 750 - 800 POUND THAT WE WERE OVERLOADED. *TR",

THE NOISE REPEATED EVERY TIME THE BRAKES WERE STEPPED ON. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE SERVICE AT CRYSTAL TOYOTA IN GREEN BROOK, NEW JERSEY, AND THEY DID SOME WORK ON IT.  ABOUT TEN DAYS LATER THE NOISE RETURNED.  THE CRYSTAL TOYOTA SERVICE FOREMAN STATED THAT ROTOR PADS NOW HAVE A METALLIC CONTENT. WHENEVER MOISTURE FORMS ON THE PADS DUE TO THE WEATHER, NOISE CAN RESULT. THE SERVICE APPLIED AN ADDITIVE.   THE LOUD NOISE REAPPEARED EARLY JANUARY 2007. CRYSTAL TOYOTA SERVICE SUGGESTED DRIVING THE CAR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THE NOISE WOULD GO AWAY. THIS WAS CORRECT. THE NOISE WENT AWAY AFTER DRIVING ABOUT HALF A MILE AND STEPPING REPEATEDLY ON THE BRAKES. I COULD NOT SEE THIS AS A LONG- TERM SOLUTION, HOWEVER, AS THE NOISE LEVEL WAS EXTREME, AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT AN EXCESSIVE IMPACT AND STRESS WERE OCCURRING. IT APPEARED THAT THE BRAKES WOULD EVENTUALLY FAIL. I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA CORPORATION CUSTOMER SERVICE AND JOE LACEFIELD, A NEW JERSEY REPRESENTATIVE, CALLED ME. LACEFIELD DOWNPLAYED MY CONCERN AND SAID HE WOULD LOOK AT THE CAR ON JANUARY 26. I TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT HEAR THE NOISE SINCE IT DID NOT OCCUR ON MOST DAYS.   LACEFIELD CALLED ME AFTER LOOKING AT THE CAR AND SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD NO NOISE. I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD EXPECTED THAT AND HAD POINTED IT OUT TO HIM. HE THEN SAID THAT WHAT I HEARD MUST HAVE BEEN SOME PLAIN EVERYDAY BRAKE NOISE AND THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM!  TOYOTA CORPORATION CUSTOMER SERVICE THEN TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO.   THE NOISE HAS NOW OCCURRED ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES. THE ATTITUDE OF LACEFIELD AND OF TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT MY COMPLAINT HAS NO MERIT, AND THAT THE EXTREME LOUD NOISE DOES NOT EVEN EXIST!

EVENTS LEADING TO FAILURE: FAILURE IS CONSTANT SINCE IT IS PRESENT DURING NORMAL OPERATION OF VEHICLE; 2. FAILURE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES: IF I ACCELERATE (STEP ON THE GAS PEDAL), THE VEHICLE HESITATES/LAGS/DIES FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE VEHICLE WILL BEGIN MOVING. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FAILURE IS THAT THERE IS CONSTANT DANGER WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN DURING GAPS IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC. ALTHOUGH A MARGIN OF SAFETY IS ALWAYS USED, I AM AFRAID THAT ONE DAY, SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN TO REDUCE THIS MARGIN, E.G. ONCOMING CAR IS ACCELERATING VERY QUICKLY OR THE HESITATION WORSENS FROM A FEW SECONDS TO SEVERAL SECONDS; 3.) WHAT WAS DONE TO CORRECT THE FAILURE: NOTHING. CONTACTED TWO TOYOTA DEALERS, DON DAVIS TOYOTA AND FREEMAN TOYOTA, AND WAS TOLD BY JOHN AND TIM, SERVICE DEPT ADVISORS, THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR TOYOTAS SINCE ADOPTING FLY-BY OR DRIVE-BY WIRE. BOTH AUTHORIZED TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES SAY THAT TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THIS COMPLAINT BUT THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE; THIS IS NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURE AND FALLS WITHIN THEIR DESIGN PARAMETERS. NO PARTS WILL BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED. THIS SEEMS TO BE A DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW BY TOYOTA.

I HAVE HAD SEVERAL \"CLOSE CALLS\" BECAUSE OF THIS DELAYED ACCELERATION. IN THE TIME THAT THE CAR DECIDES TO DOWNSHIFT AND ACCELERATE, TRAFFIC HAS CLOSED IN ON YOU ENOUGH THAT SEVERAL ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN NARROWLY AVOIDED.  I HAVE NOT REPORTED THIS TO TOYOTA AS YET, BUT FEEL THAT THEY WILL SAY THE SAME AS LEXUS DID.  *NM",
