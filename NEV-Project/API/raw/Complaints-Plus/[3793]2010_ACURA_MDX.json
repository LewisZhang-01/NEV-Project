WITHIN ABOUT 50 MILES, ALL OF THE OTHER WARNING LIGHTS COMING ON IN SUCCESSION.  THERE WAS NO SHOULDER OR AREA TO PULL ON THIS SECTION OF HIGHWAY NEAR MONO LAKE AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THE CAR LOST ALL POWER AND ALL THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  I TRIED TO TURN ON THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS AND THEY WOULDN'T WORK.

OUR CAR WAS COMPLETELY DEAD AND WE ALSO HAD NO EMERGENCY LIGHTS.  WE QUICKLY GOT OUT OUR CAMPING LANTERN AND WRAPPED OUR REFLECTIVE SAFETY ROPE AROUND THE CAR AND LUCKILY HAD CELLPHONE RECEPTION AND CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE.  IT TOOK A CHP OFFICER OVER AN HOUR TO SHINE LIGHTS ON THE CAR AND ANOTHER 90 MINUTES FOR A TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE.

PULLING OUT OF THE REPAIR SHOP,  WE GOT A CHECK CHARGING SYSTEM LIGHT AND TURNED AROUND FINDING OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE ALTERNATOR WHICH WAS REPLACED THE NEXT DAY.

I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.  IT WAS AROUND 5:30 PM. I WAS DRIVING SLOWLY (BETWEEN 2-3 MPH) AS THERE WAS A CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PARKING SPACE IN WHICH I WAS GOING TO PARK.  I WAS MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN INTO THE PARKING SPACE.  AS I PROCEEDED INTO THE PARKING SPACE MY LEFT FOOT WAS ON THE FLOOR AND MY RIGHT FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE, ALTERNATING BETWEEN BRAKING AND IDLING. I WAS NOT USING THE ACCELERATOR, JUST THE BRAKE AND THE IDLING ENGINE. AS I APPROACHED THE CURB TO MY FINAL STOP, THE CAR SUDDENLY LUNGED FORWARD OVER THE CURB AND HIT A TREE.  I REPORTED THESE DETAILS TO THE ACURA DEALERSHIP WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR REPAIRS.  I TOLD THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR AND THEY NEEDED TO CHECK THE ACCELERATION.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER MY CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME AND THE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH ACCELERATOR.  ABOUT 10 MONTHS LATER (MARCH 2013) A SIMILAR ACCELERATION HAPPENED. THIS TIME I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE IN A PARKING LOT.  I ENTERED THE PARKING SPACE BY MAKING A RIGHT TURN.  MY LEFT FOOT WAS ON THE FLOOR; MY RIGHT FOOT WAS ON THE BREAK.  THERE WAS ONLY 1 OTHER CAR IN THE PARKING LOT.  IT WAS ABOUT 10:30 AM.  I WAS ALTERNATING BETWEEN BRAKING AND IDLING.  JUST BEFORE THE FINAL STOP THE CAR LUNGED FORWARD HITTING A BRICK WALL.  THE DEALERSHIP RECOGNIZED ME FROM MY PREVIOUS VISIT.  I TOLD THE REPRESENTATIVE WHAT HAPPENED.  I TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR IT IS NOT SUPPOSE TO ACCELERATE LIKE IT DID.  ONCE AGAIN THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I SAID THIS CAR IS A SAFETY HAZARD; I AM NOT GOING TO DRIVE THE CAR.  I LEFT THE CAR THERE.   *TR",

WHEN I PRESSED THE BRAKES, THERE WAS MINIMAL RESISTANCE, AND THE CAR DIDN'T STOP WHATSOEVER. IT DIDN'T SKID OR SLIDE, THERE WAS NO BRAKE PRESSURE AT ALL. I HAD A FEW SECONDS TO DECIDE IF I WANTED TO: PULL INTO A DITCH AND PROBABLY FLIP THE SUV, PULL INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, OR HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME THAT WAS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT.

THE DEALER RAN A SERIES OF TESTS BUT COULD NOT IDENTIFY A REASON FOR WHAT HAPPENED, AND DROVE THE CAR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, BUT TOLD US THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  WE WERE, OF COURSE, NO LONGER COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED THE LEASE.  I SUBSEQUENTLY HAD A SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS AT 1919 TORRANCE BLVD.
