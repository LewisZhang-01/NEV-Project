        "summary": "We take  good care of our cars and we do all required maintenance and oil changes but we are now facing a water pump failure that caused my engine to fail without any warring. On Wednesday March 9th  I was passing a Semi Truck on a County Road and I heard a pop then lost all power and smoke came from under my hood. I had a guarding angel with me that day because there was another Semi truck approaching me in the passing lane and both Semi trucks slowed way down so that I was able to pull over. I saw my life flash before my eyes. This repair is going to cost us $4,700.00 or more if they should find any additional damage to my engine once they get all the parts to fix the car.  How can a modern day car cost  $4,700.00 to fix a water pump that caused the engine failure and overheat without A SINGLE WARNING!!! It seems like maybe Ford should look into recommending or insist that these internal WATER pumps be serviced/replaced at a reasonable mileage point maybe 80,000 or 100,000 miles to prevent a catastrophic loss. Water pumps  will never out last an engine so getting them replaced early would help protect the engine and other damage that could happen.    Just 8 days before my engine failed my car was in a Ford dealership garage  for Oil Change, a cooling system flushing, belts and spark plugs replaced, not sure why at that time there was not something said about replacing the water pump? I know that The Ford Company is well aware of this issue so why would this information not be passed along to all dealership so that the service/maintenance garage personal know what to do to prevent this from happening.  I would like to help prevent this issue from happening to anyone else.  Next time someone might die, I almost did  because of the engine failure on  a simple water pump .",

I also called Ford customer service asking if they would be responsible for this repair since this was a known defect on this vehicle. This defect is definitely a safety issue but Ford is refusing to approve the repair. They are claiming that they voluntarily extended their warranty for 10 years and would have made a repair under the warranty if there was an issue with the braking system during that time period. I replied that since they never advised anyone of this defect we were disadvantaged to take actions to trade in or sell the vehicle.

After extensive reviewing it appears this is a known issue with the 2007-2010 Ford Edges and Ford has yet to step up to the plate and address this known issue. Look on Facebook under Ford Motor Company and see how many other owners are having this issue. How can you run a business knowing this happens and then not being able to back it up by fixing the issue. I could have had another 4-5 years with my car and now I have to have burden and cost of finding a new car due to negligence on Fords part. I truly enjoyed my Ford Edge however in the future I will no longer drive any type of Ford car or Lincoln knowing this is how you treat known issues. I'm just glad it was not -30degrees out and this happened. Shame on Ford. I will also spread the word about this issue and to anyone else thinking of buying a Ford.

GOING DOWN A HILL, I ALWAYS GO SLOWLY TO ALLOW MYSELF PROPER BRAKING TIME, AS IT IS A VERY STEEP HILL ONTO A MAJOR AND VERY BUSY ROAD.  I EXPERIENCED A LACK OF BRAKES.  I STOOD ON THEM AS HARD AS I COULD, AND IT BARELY SLOWED ME DOWN ENOUGH TO PREVENT ME FROM GOING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  AFTER I RECOVERED MY HEART RATE, I TURNED AROUND AND WENT HOME.

I THEN BROUGHT IT TO A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, AS THE FORD DEALERSHIP MY DAD PURCHASED THE CAR FROM AND ALL THE SERVICE WAS DONE AT WAS, WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, 40 MINUTES AWAY.

MY RADIATOR OVERFLOW WAS EMPTY. I LET IT COOL SOME MORE AND PUT IN 1 1/2 GALLONS OF COOLANT. I STARTED THE ENGINE, IT STARTED VERY ROUGH.

HE SAID, \"THAT'S NOT GOOD.\" HE ATTACHED HIS DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT AND A BATTERY JUMPER. SAME RESULT. HE SAID HE DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO LOOK AT MY ENGINE TO KNOW IT WAS BLOWN. THE ERROR MESSAGES ON HIS EQUIPMENT CONFIRMED IT. HE PUT WATER IN MY RADIATOR AND PUT IT UNDER PRESSURE. WATER AGAIN STARTED POURING OUT. HE PULLED OUT THE OIL PAN DRAIN PLUG AND WHAT LOOKED LIKE A VANILLA MILKSHAKE OOZED OUT. HE INSPECTED MY WATER PUMP AND CONFIRMED THAT IT HAD FAILED. IT DRAINED MY RADIATOR AND MY CAR OVERHEATED AND BLEW THE HEAD IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, AGAIN WITH NO INDICATORS OF ANY KIND THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I HAVE TO REPLACE MY ENGINE. I STILL OWE MONEY ON IT SO IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO TRASH THE CAR. MY CAR HAS ONLY 70,000 MILES ON IT. UPON DOING RESEARCH I FOUND A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST FORD FOR THIS WATER PUMP PROBLEM PROBLEM.

THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WITHOUT NOTICEABLE ISSUES RELATED TO THE BRAKING PERFORMING. THAT WAS UNTIL YESTERDAY. THE HISSING NOISE WAS STILL PRESENT AND THE PEDAL WOULD GO DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES. THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION AND WOULD NOT STOP PROPERLY FOR ME WHEN I WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN. I HAD TO PUMP THE BRAKES IN ORDER FOR THE VEHICLE TO COME TO A STOP. IF THE PEDAL WAS HELD DOWN, A SQUEALING NOISE THEN OCCURRED. I RESEARCHED ONLINE TO SEE IF THIS WAS A COMMON ISSUE WITH OTHER FORD EDGE OWNERS, AND I CAME ACROSS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT FORD RELEASED IN 2014 TITLED, \"13N02.\" THE EXTENDED WARRANTY TALKED ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT HAD BEEN OCCURRING IN FORD EDGE MODELS MADE BETWEEN 2010-2013. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES WAS SPOT ON WITH WHAT I HAD JUST EXPERIENCED WITH MY VEHICLE AND I MET THE PROGRAM TERMS DUE TO MY CAR BEING LESS THAN 10 YEARS OLD AND UNDER 150,000 MILES. I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP TO HAVE MY CAR REPAIRED. TO MY SURPRISE, THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED BASED ON MY VIN NUMBER. WE THEN QUICKLY DISCOVERED IT WAS DUE TO MY CAR BEING BUILT FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCLUDED DATE ON THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. THE WARRANTY COVERED VEHICLES FROM MAY 3, 2010-MARCH 28, 2013. MY VEHICLE WAS MADE ON APRIL 28, 2010. THE STAFF AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS EITHER. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE DATES ON THE WARRANTY SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. I HAD TO PAY TO HAVE MY BRAKE BOOSTER REPLACED FOR THE SAME SERVICE OTHERS WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO FORD'S ATTENTION BEFORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED RELATED TO THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

(IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE ROAD, HOW DID THE FRONT TIRE NOT CONTACT IT AS WELL??) THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AHEAD OF US. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER, BUT HAD TO \"INCH\" ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR ABOUT 200YDS TO GET TO A SAFE POINT TO CHANGE THE TIRE. AFTER THAT, WE WENT TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER FOR ASSISTANCE, AS WE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE DRIVING ANOTHER 500 MILES ON A \"MINI\" SPARE TIRE. THE DEALER SHARED WITH US THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AFTER SOME EXAMINATION WE DID NOTICE A TINY PUNCTURE OF THE TIRE ON THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE TIRE. THERE IS A CORRESPONDING \"PUSHED IN\" SURFACE OF THE ALUMINUM WHEEL. (I HAVE PHOTOS AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS THE WHEEL AND TIRE). I REPORT THIS AS A CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS AS THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT HAD THE WHEEL SEPARATED. FORD MOTOR COMPANY DID NOTHING TO ASSIST WITH THIS DEFECTIVE WHEEL. WE ARE ALSO NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN IF WE GET ANOTHER BLOWOUT. SO FAR THIS HAS COST US ABOUT $1,000 FOR REPLACEMENT WHEEL & TIRE.  *TR",

SEEING IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE LIGHT IS COMING IN.  I HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF GOING 80 AND NOT REALIZING IT SINCE THE DIAL IS JUST ONE BIG BLACK CIRCLE.
