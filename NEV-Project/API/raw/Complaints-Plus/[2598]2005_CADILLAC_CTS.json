        "summary": "During normal driving, my service stibilatrak light comes on. While the message is on, the TCS kicks in and it grabs the wheel and stops the car. I've been reared ended once and two barely missed collisions. When the TCS activates, it stops the car completely and the only way to drive the car is to turn it off for a few second and then restart it. That resets the computer and turn the message light off. The TCS or ABS does not come on in the dash, just the stilibatrak message in the message center. Once it's turned off, it does not come on until the next time the TCS activates. I've had several diagnostic tests to check the problem or get a code but there is no code. I've been told that the car is clear of codes. The dealer cannot find a code or the problem. I've spent several hundred dollars on trying to locate the problem.  The car, as is, is a death trap. I can't drive it because I don't know when the traction will kick on. I've taken good care of my car, nice bodywork and low milage but it's not safe to drive and no one knows how to fix it, including the dealer. At $200 an hour to try to find the problem is unforeseeable financially on my pension. One option is to junk the car for $200. I can't donate or sale it because it will not pass MD inspection. I can't trade it; I can't afford another car note.  I've had this issue for almost a year. This happens every time I drive it, so I had to buy another car which I was not ready to buy. No major damage to report.",

This could have gotten me and my 3 year old son seriously hurt by sudden loss of power and slick roadways not being able to avoid or brake properly or even steer away from on coming collision.  The dissimilar metals are aluminum nut with a mild steel washer backed by a stainless steel washer before it contacts the radiator. This car has 101k miles and has been babied it's entire life. And when I see the 4 brake lines are about to rust out after all the repairs that have already been done.  This is just poor quality material and craftsmanship.

AFTER GATHERING MYSELF I TURNED THE IGNITION FROM THE RUN POSITION TO OFF. I LOOKED UP AND NOTICED THERE WAS SMOKE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I JUMPED OUT, LIFTED THE HOOD, AND HEARD POPPING AND STEAM/SMOKE RISING UP FROM UNDERNEATH THE ENGINE BY THE FIREWALL.  I PULLED THE OIL DIPSTICK AND I WAS ABOUT A QUART LOW, AND IT LOOKED NORMAL. I WAITED ABOUT 30 MIN AND CHECKED THE LEVEL AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT. I THEN TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOT RESPONSE AT ALL. I WAS UNABLE TO ROLL UP MY WINDOWS, AND THERE WAS NO POWER TO DISPLAY ANY INFORMATION ON DASH.  WHEN MY WIFE ARRIVED I HOOKED UP JUMPER CABLES AND AFTER A WHILE I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE KEY FORWARD TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. IT SAID MY BATTERY WAS AT THE CORRECT VOLTS, AND THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS ON MY DASH.  WHEN I TURNED THE IGNITION TO START. MY DASH FLICKERED RAPIDLY AND THERE WAS A CLICKING NOISE BUT THE ENGINE MADE NO SOUND AS IF IT WAS TRYING TO TURN OVER. SO I CALLED TOW TRUCK AND GOT TOWED TO MY HOUSE.

THE CADILLAC DRIFTED LEFT AND HIT THE CURB.  REAR WHEELS HIT JUST BEFORE THE FRONT.  THE HIT WAS PRETTY HARD - MISALIGNED BOTH LEFT WHEELS.  THE CAR RECOVERED OFF THE CURB, BUT A STABILITY CONTROL WARNING FLASHED ON THE NAVIGATION/INFORMATION SCREEN, AND THE BRAKES COMPLETELY QUIT!  THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT CLEAR TO THE FLOOR, AND I SAILED THRU A RED LIGHT AT THE INTERSECTION.  ABOUT 3 - 4 SECONDS LATER, THE WARNING SCREEN WENT OUT, AND THE BRAKES RETURNED.  CLEARLY THIS IMPACT WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY.  HOWEVER, THE FAILURE MODE OF THE STABILITY/ABS SYSTEM SHOULD BE FULL BRAKES WITHOUT ANTI-SKID, RATHER THAN NO BRAKES.  *JB",

THE DIFFERENTIAL THAT COMES STOCK IN EVERY 2004-2005 CTS-V CADILLAC IS NOT RATED TO HANDLE AS MUCH HORSEPOWER AND TORQUE AS THE CAR PUTS OUT.  GM CUT CORNERS AND PUT IN A DIFFERENTIAL THAT WAS MEANT FOR THEIR V6 BASE MODEL CTS THAT MAKES ABOUT HALF THE POWER.    WHEN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL BLEW UP, IT ALSO DESTROYED MY DRIVESHAFT.      I NOTICED THE DIFFERENTIAL OVER TIME STARTED TO WHINE AND CLUNK MORE AND MORE AND BECOME LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN WHILE DRIVING I HEARD A LOUD BOOM AND A BUNCH OF CLUNKING AND METAL GRINDING.  THE CAR WAS IMMEDIATELY UNDRIVEABLE.       MY DEALERSHIP REPLACED MY DRIVESHAFT AND  THE DIFFERENTIAL WITH A 2006 CTS-V DIFFERENTIAL WHICH IS A BEEFIER PIECE.  I HAVE 2500 MILES ON THE NEW DIFFERENTIAL WHICH IS ALREADY STARTING TO WHINE AND CLUNK.  WHEEL HOP IS STILL ATROCIOUS AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS DIFFERENTIAL BREAKS AS WELL.  MY DEALERSHIP DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ISSUES WITH CTS-V REAR ENDS, AND TRIED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON ME BY STATING THAT MY REAR TIRES WERE VERY WORN FOR ONLY 3370 MILES, SO I MUST HAVE BEEN ABUSING THAT CAR.  THAT IS NOT THE CASE, AND THESE TIRES ARE NOTORIOUS FOR HAVING THE WORST TREAD WEAR OF ANY TIRE ON THE MARKET, AND EVERY CTS-V OWNER COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW LONG THEY LAST.
