After months of waiting, and confirmation of others that already got the repair done, I went ahead and scheduled the recall replacement with GM themselves, which in turn set it up with Ron Norris GMC in town. Even though I set this up a couple weeks ago and have received text and email confirmations reminding me of the appointment, I just received a call from Ron Norris, I was on the way to their dealership to have this recall taken care, telling me GM does not have the part for my truck and did not give me any more information about it. This is a serious issue and I have given them plenty of time to have it replaced. You ordered them to do this and after months they still do not have parts, they are dragging their feet on something that could kill the passenger of my vehicle. Could you please push them to get the part as I do not feel safe having a passenger ride in my truck now. If something happens I will hold you and GM responsible for the delays.",
