THEY KEPT MY CAR 5 DAYS, NEVER CALLED ME REGARDING STATUS, I CALLED THEM ON THE 5 TH DAY AND I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS MODIFIED AND THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. I EXPLAINED IT WAS PREVIOUSLY SECRET SERVICE CAR THAT'S WHY IT HAD ADDITIONAL WIRING. TOLD ME I HAD TO REMOVE THE WIRED BEFORE THEY COULD FIX OR HE COULD DO IT FOR $135 HR. AND IT WOULD TAKE 5 TO 6 HOURS. I REFUSED. HOW DID THE INTERCEPTORS GET REPAIRED OR WERE THEY NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL? THE MORE I SEARCH ON LINE I\"M FINDING THE DEALERS DON'T WANT TO DO THE REPAIR BECAUSE IT'S TOO LABOR INTENSIVE. IF THAT'S THE CASE WHAT RECOURSE DO I HAVE? I HAVE NO HEADLIGHTS, NO TAILLIGHTS AND NO DASH LIGHTS. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR THEY TOLD ME \"WE GOT YOUR HEADLIGHTS TO WORK, BUT THEY COULD GO OUT ANYTIME\" GREAT! I CAN'T DRIVE AT NIGHT AND I'LL PROBABLY GET A TICKET FOR NO TAIL LIGHTS. I CALLED FORD BUT THE PERSON IN THE PHILLIPINES COULDN'T GRASP WHAT I WAS SAYING. IS THERE NO U.S. CUSTOMER SERVICE?

NEVERTHELESS, I PUT THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON UNTIL I RETURNED HOME RIGHT AWAY.     EARLIER THIS WEEK, I USED THE CAR AGAIN WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS ISSUES.   HOWEVER A DAY LATER, THE ISSUE RETURNED AGAIN.   THIS TIME I WAS TRAVELING IN THE HIGHWAY AT 60 MILES PER HOUR.  ALL LOW/HIGH BEAM LIGHTS CUT OFF.   MY ONLY SOLUTION WAS TO HOLD THE \"FLASH TO PASS\" LEVER TOWARDS ME, AND THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS WOULD TURN ON.   HOWEVER, IT IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME DRIVING THIS WAY.   I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MANY MECHANICS THAT THE MAIN CULPRIT IS THE LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE (LCM) AND THIS SAFETY ISSUE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY COMMON IN GRAND MARQUIS ESPECIALLY 2005 MODELS.   CONSUMERS AND PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT MAY NEED TO FURTHER INTERVENE, SO FORD CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAFETY/HAZARDOUS.  IN MY CASE, MY BOTTOM BUMPER SUFFERED, BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE - IT COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  CURRENTLY, I ONLY USE MY VEHICLE DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT REPAIRS CAN EXCEED $700 OR MORE AND IN SOME INSTANCES, THE ISSUE RETURNS WITHIN A FEW MONTHS AFTER REPLACING THIS PART.  THIS ELECTRICAL ISSUE SHOULD PERHAPS BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED AS THE LCM COULD BE THE MAIN CULPRIT, BUT SOMETHING ELSE COULD ALSO BE TRIGGERING THE LCM TO FAIL.   THANK YOU GREATLY!     *TR",

THIS MEANS THERE ARE CARS ON THE ROAD THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVING DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS KNOWING THAT THEIR CARS HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT WORKING CORRECTLY, BUT NO PARTS AVAILABLE FROM FORD TO HONOR WARRANTY. THIS MEANS THAT CARS ARE BEING USED THAT MAY NOT BE LEGAL TO DRIVE IN THE RAIN (MOST STATES HAVE HEADLIGHT ON IF RAINING LAW) AND ALSO WILL NOT PASS STATE INSPECTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT PARTS ARE NOT ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE, BUT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN SEVERAL DAYS. IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, WHY ARE THERE NO PARTS? NO OTHER HELP OR LOANER VEHICLE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE.  *TR",

THEY WILL NOT COME ON IN EITHER THE AUTOMATIC OR MANUAL DASHBOARD SWITCH POSITIONS. (THE BULBS ARE STILL GOOD.) THE PARKING LIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, TAIL LIGHTS, AND BRAKE LIGHTS CONTINUED TO FUNCTION. THIS HAPPENED AT NIGHT. IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT THIS FAILURE WILL *ALWAYS* OCCUR AT NIGHT, OR DURING STORMY WEATHER, THREATENING SAFETY, BECAUSE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT NORMALLY USED DURING THE DAYTIME. LATER TESTING REVEALED THE PROBLEM TO BE INTERMITTENT. AT ONE POINT, THE AUTOMATIC DASHBOARD SWITCH POSITION WORKED FOR BOTH DIM AND HIGH-BEAMS, BUT THE MANUAL SWITCH POSITION DID NOT WORK. THE NEXT MORNING, BOTH THE AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL POSITIONS WORKED. WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED, NEITHER POSITION WOULD WORK. THIS INTERMITTENT PROBLEM IS CONSISTENT WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND REPORTS FOR THE 2003-2005 MODEL YEARS, AND THE PROBLEM IS THE LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE. THIS MODULE IS SO UNRELIABLE THAT IT HAS BEEN NAMED THE \"LIGHTS OUT MODULE\" ON THE INTERNET. A SAMPLING OF COMPLAINTS CAN BE FOUND AT THESE WEB SITES: HTTP://WWW.ARFC.ORG/COMPLAINTS/2003/FORD/CROWN_VICTORIA/EXTERIOR_LIGHTING/PROBLEM.ASPX HTTP://WWW.ARFC.ORG/COMPLAINTS/2004/FORD/CROWN_VICTORIA/EXTERIOR_LIGHTING/PROBLEM.ASPX HTTP://WWW.ARFC.ORG/COMPLAINTS/2005/FORD/CROWN_VICTORIA/EXTERIOR_LIGHTING/PROBLEM.ASPX. THIS IS A *SAFETY* ISSUE. LIVES ARE AT STAKE. PLEASE FORCE A RECALL TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE KILLED. ALTHOUGH THE PARKING LIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS CONTINUED TO WORK, SO OTHER DRIVERS CAN SEE THE CAR WITH THE FAILED HEADLIGHTS, THE DRIVER OF THE CAR WITH THE FAILED HEADLIGHTS *CANNOT* SEE WHERE HE IS GOING!! HE COULD RUN INTO A PARKED CAR, HIT A PEDESTRIAN, HIT A BICYCLIST, HIT A TREE OR OTHER OBSTRUCTION, ETC. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION!  *TR",

AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 PM ON 3/25/12, I LOST MY HEADLIGHTS AGAIN WHILE DRIVING THROUGH FLORIDA.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY FROM MY MOTEL WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.  THE NEXT MORNING, 3/26/12, I TOOK MY CAR TO AN INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED GARAGE, AND THE MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A DEFECTIVE LIGHT CONTROL MODULE.  HE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A NEW MODULE FROM A NEARBY FORD DEALERSHIP AND SUCCESSFULLY INSTALL THE MODULE INTO MY CAR.  THERE IS NO QUESTION THE LIGHT CONTROL MODULE WAS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE MECHANIC WAS UNABLE TO RESTORE MY HEADLIGHTS BY FIRST TRYING TO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH OR THE HEADLIGHT DIMMER SWITCH.  WHAT'S MORE, HE WAS UNABLE TO GET THE DEFECTIVE LIGHT CONTROL MODULE TO RESPOND TO AN EXTERNAL COMPUTER COMMAND.  THE REPAIR COST $816.77.  I WAS CONCERNED THAT I SUDDENLY LOST MY HEADLIGHTS WHILE DRIVING ON A BUSY INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BUT EVEN MORE CONCERNED WHEN I HEARD A PARTS SPECIALIST AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP THAT PROVIDED MY NEW REPLACEMENT LIGHT CONTROL MODULE CLAIM HIS DEALERSHIP WAS REPLACING AN AVERAGE OF THREE OF THESE MODULES WEEKLY ON FORD CROWN VICTORIA PATROL CARS BEING DRIVEN BY LOCAL POLICE.  THE IDEA OF POLICEMAN LOSING THEIR HEADLIGHTS DURING HIGH SPEED PURSUITS AT NIGHT MADE ME VERY CONCERNED.  MY CONCERN WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN I STARTED INVESTIGATING THE MATTER ON THE INTERNET AND READ MANY STORIES SIMILAR TO MINE.

THE HEADLIGHTS WERE CHECKED BY THE FORD DEALER ON AUGUST 5, 2011.  TESTS REVEALED NO CAUSE BUT THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED THE LIGHT CONTROL MODULE.

THEN I DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF INTERNET POSTINGS IN WHICH DRIVERS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH GRAND MARQUIS' OR FORD CROWN VICTORIAS MADE IN THE 2000'S.  THEN I FOUND A WEBSITE WHICH STATED THAT THE ORIGINAL LIGHT CONTROL MODULE HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM INVOLVING A BAD CIRCUIT THAT IS THE DEFINITIVE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE LOCAL FORD DEALER ACKNOWLEDGED AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM (EVEN CITING SEVERAL CROWN VICTORIA POLICE INTERCEPTORS THAT REQUIRED LCM REPLACEMENT), BUT BECAUSE FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL, THEY WANTED OVER $1,000 FOR DIAGNOSIS, PART, AND LABOR.  A WEBSITE ALSO NOTED THAT FORD RECENTLY COMPLETELY REVISED THE LCM WITH AN INTERNAL REDESIGN BY FORD ENGINEERS SO THAT THE NEW LCMS WILL NEVER FAIL.  THE WEBSITE ALSO NOTED THAT SOME DEALERS CONTINUE TO SELL THE OLD DEFECTIVE LCM WHICH WILL ONLY FAIL AGAIN.  MY OPINION:  BESIDES NOT WANTING TO PAY AN EXHORBITANT AMOUNT TO REPLACE ONE COMPONENT OF A VEHICLE'S LIGHT SYSTEM, IT APPEARS FORD IS FULLY AWARE OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY DEFECT AFFECTING MANY THOUSANDS OF GRAND MARQUIS' AND CROWN VICTORIAS CURRENTLY IN USE, BUT  HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.

I ACCIDENTLY FORCED THE HIGH BEAM ON BY FLIPPING THE TURN/HIGH BEAM LEVER AND I HELD THE LEVER IN THAT POSITION UNTIL I COULD RETURN TO THE RIGHT LANE BEHIND THE TRUCK AND STOP ON THE ROADSIDE.  TO SAY I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE IS NOT SIMPLY DRAMA.  THE WORST PART WAS NOT KNOWING IF MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE WORKING.  WHILE OFF THE ROAD, I COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURE.  I PUT ON THE LOW BEAM AND PROCEEDED ON I-81.  AFTER SOME MILES, I AGAIN TRIED THE LEFT TURN SIGNAL AND AGAIN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  THIS TIME I WAS READY, AND USED THE HIGH BEAM LEVER TO GET TO THE ROADSIDE.  AGAIN I COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURE.  I EXITED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, RUNNING ON LOW BEAM, AND THE LIGHTS WENT OUT AGAIN ON THE RAMP WHEN I OPERATED THE LEFT TURN SIGNAL.    I CONTINUED TO OCALA BY WAY OF ATLANTA, RUNNING IN DAYLIGHT ONLY.  I TOOK THE CAR TO OCALA FORD AS SOON AS I ARRIVED IN OCALA.  THE DEALER HAD THE CAR SEVERAL DAYS AND FINALLY DUPLICATED THE FAILURE.  THEY REPLACED A MODULE AT THE COST OF $786.00 AND SAID THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. NO REPAIR WAS DONE TO THE TURN SIGNAL.  I GOT THE MODULE FROM THE DEALER AND SENT IT TO NHTSA FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE IF IT ACTUALLY WAS DEFECTIVE. IF NOT, THEN MY CAR PRESENTS A RISK TO EVERYONE SHARING THE HIGHWAY WITH ME AT NIGHT, BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WOULD STILL BE THERE.

NEEDLESS TO SAY I DID NOT REPLACE THE FAILED TIRES WITH MICHELIN TIRES.    I EXPERIENCED AN UNREASONABLE TREAD SEPARATION FAILURE RATE WITH MICHELIN TIRES (TIME WILL TELL FOR THE REMAINING 3 TIRES).  THIS INDICATES A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH THE MICHELIN DESIGN/MANUFACTURING.      I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT OF TREAD SEPARATION FAILURES AND THE RESULTING PROBLEMS AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME DEATHS ATTRIBUTABLE TO TREAD SEPARATION FAILURES.  BECAUSE OF THIS AND THE EXTREMELY HIGH FAILURE RATE, I FEEL THAT THE MICHELIN RADIAL TIRES PRESENT A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.    I RECOMMEND THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM.  NOTE:  I READ THAT TIRES MANUFACTURED IN EUROPE DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM DUE TO A DIFFERENT DESIGN/MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  IF THIS IS SO, THE US SHOULD MANDATE THE EUROPEAN DESIGN FOR US MANUFACTURED TIRES.
