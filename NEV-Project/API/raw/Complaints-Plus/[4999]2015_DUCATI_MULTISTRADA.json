        "summary": "1) WHEN DRIVING THIS MOTORCYCLE IN SECOND GEAR AND APPLYING THE THROTTLE, THE BIKE HAS A 2-4 SECOND RESPONSE DELAY THAT IS FOLLOWED BY AN EXTREME ENGINE AND POWER SURGE. THIS SURGE IS VERY STRONG IN SECOND GEAR AND CAUSED THE RIDER TO MOMENTARILY LOSE CONTROL OF THE BIKE. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER. DUCATI SUGGESTED THAT I ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE SURGES BY REDUCING THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL THAT LIMIT FRONT WHEEL RISES.  THIS IS BOTH A DANGEROUS SUGGESTION AND INEFFECTIVE AS IT ONLY A PART OF THE PROBLEM. SUBSEQUENTLY I WAS TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL DUCATI ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM. NO SUCH UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED OR COMPLETED.   2) THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL ALSO CAUSED POWER SURGES THAT FORCED THE BIKE TO MOVE ERRATICALLY AND DANGEROUSLY IN AND OUT OF TURNS. AGAIN, I WAS TOLD TO TURN THE SAFETY DEVICES TO LOWEST SETTINGS OR OFF. THIS IS AN UNSAFE RIDING CONDITION AS THIS BIKE IS DESIGNED TO USE THOSE CONTROLS.   3) ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS THE DASH INDICATED THAT THE BIKE WAS ENGAGED IN A RUNNING GEAR WHEN IT ACTUALLY WAS IN NEUTRAL. THIS RESULTED IN A FALL AT A STOP LIGHT AND SEVERAL DANGEROUS SITUATIONS ON THE ROAD. THE GEAR INDICATOR WAS ADJUSTED BY THE DEALER BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUED. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY REPORTED ON SEVERAL MODELS IN THE DUCATI LINE AND HAS NEVER BEEN ADDRESSED. I SPOKE WITH DUCATI AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS A \"DANGEROUS\" CONDITION BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED TO OWNERS OR FIXED.",

THE ENGINE FAILED TO RESPOND FOR SEVERAL SECONDS LEAVING ME EXPOSED IN THE PASSING LANE.  THEN IT ACCELERATED SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY CATCHING ME BY SURPRISE.  THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I TRY TO ACCELERATE IN 2ED GEAR FROM 35MPH.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAY IT IS AN ECU PROBLEM AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A FIX.  I BELIEVE THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE TRYING TO MERGE INTO FASTER TRAFFIC AS WHEN ENTERING THE FREEWAY.  I AM IN CONTACT WITH SEVERAL OWNERS OF THE SAME MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR MOTORCYCLE AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  PLEASE INTERVENE BEFORE SOME IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
