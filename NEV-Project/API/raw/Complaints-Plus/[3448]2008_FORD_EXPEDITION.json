MANY OF THESE BLOGS WERE SEVERAL YEARS OLD SO I CALLED MY LOCAL FORD SERVICE MANAGER WHO INDICATED HE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS PROBLEM AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE SINCE THE TRACTION CONTROL DOES NOT RETAIN FAULTS.  MY LOCAL SERVICE MANAGER GAVE ME A NUMBER TO FORD WHO I CALLED AND DESCRIBED THE ISSUE.  THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND COULD ONLY ADVISE ME TO TAKE IT TO A FORD SERVICE LOCATION TO CHECK OUT.

AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION, DRIVER NOTICED  WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM RIGHT FRONT WHEEL.  DRIVER GOT OUT TO INSPECT THE WHEEL, AND NOTICED THAT  THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE CALIPER  AND BRAKE ROTOR WERE EXTREMELY HOT AND SMOKE AND FLAMES WERE COMING FROM THEM. OTHER THREE WHEELS WERE COOL (NORMAL). THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS, ETC. TURNED OFF CAR, BACK ON, IN THE HOPE OF  E.G. RESETTING THE ABS CONTROLLER -- NO CHANGES. BRAKES WERE SO HOT  THAT DRIVER DECIDED TO DRIVE SOME NEARBY FRONTAGE ROADS AT LOW SPEEDS, WITHOUT USING THE BRAKES, IN AN ATTEMPT TO COOL THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE. MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE. EVENTUALLY PARKED THE VEHICLE (BRAKING CONTINUED TO BE IMPAIRED), CAME BACK AROUND 1 HOUR LATER, BRAKE HAD COOLED DOWN, WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AWAY. SIMILAR INSTANCE RECURRED ON 2012-12-18 -- AGAIN, RIGHT FRONT  BRAKE, THIS TIME IN CITY DRIVING, ROTOR WAS GLOWING ORANGE (NOT YET ON FIRE) ON A COLD NIGHT WHEN DRIVER STOPPED TO  LOOK AT IT AND PARK THE VEHICLE.    THIS IS OF COURSE A  VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION, AND COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF LIFE  DUE TO FRONT BRAKE FAILURE.    DRIVER IS AWARE THAT THERE IS A  RECALL ( 07E105000) ASSOCIATED WITH THIS YEAR OF THE VEHICLE. FORD CLAIMS THAT THIS PARTICULAR VIN IS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS RECALL. HOWEVER, DRIVER (WHO IS EXPERIENCED WITH BRAKE SYSTEMS) FEELS THAT THESE TWO EVENTS ARE VERY SUGGESTIVE OF A FAILURE IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM TO RETURN FLUID FROM THE CALIPER, LEADING TO EXCESSIVE PRESSURE IN THE CALIPER, LEADING TO THESE PROBLEMS.     DRIVER HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GET INFORMATION FROM FORD OR CONTINENTAL (OEM MANUFACTURER) THAT  WOULD UNAMBIGUOUSLY SHOW THAT THE ABS AND BRAKE MODULES IN THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE ARE FREE FROM DEFECTS AND ARE NOT SUBJECT  TO THIS RECALL.     FORD SHOULD FIX THIS!  *TR",

WE TOOK IT ON A 7,000 MILE TRIP TOWING THE TRAILER AND IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED THAT THE TOWING ABILITY WAS DANGEROUS.  THE STEERING WHEEL WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. IN ALL CASES, NO WIND OR WITH EVER THE SLIGHTEST WIND, THE VEHICLE WOULD DRIFT FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THE TRAILER WOULD WOBBLE BACK AND FORTH MAKING IT EXHAUSTING TO STEER.  WITH HIGH GUSTS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER EVEN AT 45 MPH, IT WOULD DRIFT FROM SIDE TO SIDE MAKING IT EXTREMELY HARD TO CONTROL, AND THE TRAILER FISH-TAILING BEHIND US.  IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.  WE COULD NOT GO OVER 55-60 MPH ON A WIND FREE DAY AND FEEL ANYWHERE SAFE.    WE TOOK IT INTO THE SAME DEALER WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG.  WE TOOK IT INTO ANOTHER DEALER AND THEY ALSO TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND SAID THEY COULD NOT SEE ANY PROBLEMS.  THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THIS SUSPENSION AND STEERING SYSTEM AND THE DEALERS CANNOT PUT A FINGER ON IT.  THE STEERING WHEEL HAS A TENDENCY TO CAUSE THE SUV TO DRIFT WHILE DRIVING EVEN WITHOUT THE TRAILER. IT FEELS LOOSE. IT ALSO AT TIMES, HAS A KNOCK IN IT LIKE SOMETHING IS EITHER SNAPPING BACK IN OR SNAPPING OUT OF POSITION.  WE ARE AT A LOSS AND DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP.

AND NOTICED WHAT SEEMED LIKE SANDY GRIT UNDER MY BLACK PAINT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A XZILON PAINT PROTECTION ISSUE AND ON OCT.10 PAUL KISTE ACCESSORY MNGR. FOR JARRETT FORD DAVENPORT GAVE ME A SIGNED LETTER WITH HIS NAME AND TITLE AT THE BOTTOM THAT STATED \"UPON INSPECTION OF MR. CONTE'S VEHICLE IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE PAINT PROBLEM IS A FACTORY DEFECT AND NOT DUE TO THE XZILON PAINT PROTECTION APPLICATION\" IT WENT ON TO SAY I AM REFERRING MR. CONTE TO OUR PLANT CITY STORE(45MILES AWAY)TO HAVE OUR PAINT AND BODY SPECIALIST RECOMMEND THE PROPER ROUTE TO TAKE REGARDING THE FIXING OF THIS ISSUE. UPON ARRIVAL MY VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED BY CARL DEMUTH BODY SHOP MNGR,STEVE FLACK,AND A PAINTER NAMED MIKE. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM,TOLD ME THE SAND LOOKING SUBSTANCE WAS AIR BUBBLES UNDER ALL THE PAINT AND POINTED OUT EVEN MORE DEFECTS THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF SUCH AS,\"DIMPLES\",TINY CRATER LIKE HOLES,BLEMISHES EXPOSED BY THE SUNLIGHT,AND A FEW OTHER BODYMAN TERMS THAT I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH. WHEN I ASKED WHAT WOULD CAUSE THAT,CARL SAID \"WHEN THE VEHICLES LEAVE THE FACTORY THE MILL SPEC ON THE PAINT SHOULD BE 3 TO 3.5 MILES. CARL WENT INTO THE OFFICE AND RETURNED WITH A HAND HELD MACHINE THAT MEASURED THE MILLS OF PAINT ON A VEHICLE. HE STARTED AT THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT QUARTER PANEL AND WORKED HIS WAY AROUND THE VEHICLE STOPPING AT THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT QUARTER PANEL. THE FIRST READING WAS 11 MILLS,THEN 12.5 MILLS,THAN 12 MILLS,THEN 13 MILLS AND FINALLY 14.5 MILES. HE SAID THAT IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT AT THE FACTORY THEY PAINTED MY VEHICLE SAW FLAWS THEN REPAINTED AND SO ON AND SO ON. HE ESTIMATED I HAD 4 TO 5 COATS OF PAINT ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT IF NOT FIXED THAT MY PROBLEMS WILL ONLY GET WORSE. HE SAID THAT HE WAS SURPRISED THAT IT HASN'T STARTED CRACKING AND STARING YET. HE TOLD ME A FORD REP. WOULD LOOK AT IT,SHE DID AND FOUND NO PROBLEM. *TR",
