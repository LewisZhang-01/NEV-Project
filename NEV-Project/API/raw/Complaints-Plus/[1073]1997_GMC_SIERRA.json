WHEN I INQUIRED WITH DEALERS IN MAINE AND FLORIDA THEY COULDN'T IDENTIFY A FIX WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM.  RECENTLY A DEALER IN COLORADO DISCLOSED TO ME THAT GM HAD IDENTIFIED THE CULPRIT OF THIS ANOMALY TO BE THE EGR VALVE IN THE POWER STEERING.  I SENT A LETTER TO GM STATING MY CONERN FOR CUSTOMER SAFETY AND RECEIVED A POLITE BUT POOR ANSWER BASICALLY CITING COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY STANDARDS OR GM'S DETERMINATION THAT A PRODUCT DIDN'T MEET SAFETY STANDARDS.  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SET STANDARD THAT APPLIES TO SUDDEN CHANGES TO STEERABILITY OF A VEHICLE DUE TO SUCH A DEFECT.  I'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH AN OWNER OF A 97 CHEVROLET THAT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AND HE ALSO EXPRESSED DISBELIEF THAT THIS WASN'T A SAFETY CONCERN.  WHEN I POINTED OUT TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP THAT IN MY OPINION THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY CONCERN FOR GMC HE COULD ONLY SYMPATHETCALLY AGREE AND POINT OUT THAT A VOLUNTARY RECALL ON WOULD HAVE TO BE A COMPANY DECISION.  THEY DID POINT OUT THOUGH, THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE 1997 SERIES TRUCKS AND THAT WHEN THE DEALERSHIP BROUGHT IT TO GMS ATTENTION, WHICH WAS APPARENTLY ONLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO,  THEY WERE JUST DISCOVERING THE CAUSE THEMSELVES.  I AM GRAVELY CONCERNED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM REPAIR SHOPS PRIOR TO THIS DEFECT BEING IDENTIFIED AND THUS STILL DRIVING AROUND WITH THIS DANGEROUS POTENTIAL FOR TRAGEDY STILL LINGERING.

IT DIED, I PULLED OVER, TURNED OF IGNITION, AND RE-STARTED THE MOTOR, AND AGAIN THE MOTOR STARTED WITHOUT HESITATION. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AND AGAIN THE SAME THING, EXCEPT THIS TIME THE MOTOR WOULD NOT RE-START.  VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED. IT WAS REPLACED AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO, APPROXIMATLEY 05/15/2001, MY VEHICLE STARTED TO BEHAVE IN THE SAME WAY. WHILE TURNING LEFT AT AN INTERSECTION, THE VEHICLE DIED, AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF ONCOMING TRAFFICE THAT WAS APPROACHING. I RE-STARTED THE ENGINE AND PROCEEDED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THIS HAS OCCURED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS, WITH THE MOST RECENT EVENT OCCURING YESTERDAY, 07222001, IN WHICH I WAS ALMOST \"T-BONED\" AT AN INTERSECTION WHEN THE ENGINE FAILED. I HAVE KEPT THE FUEL FILTER CHANGED AND I NOT USE THE SAME GAS STATION CONSITANTLY. THE FUEL PUMP HAS ALWAYS MADE A LOUD BUZZING NOISE, EVEN THE FIRST PUMP THAT WAS REPLACED AT THE DEALERSHIP MADE THIS SAME NOISE. I UNDERSTAND THAT GMC RE-DESIGNED THIS PUMP FOR THIS 1997 MODEL. WHAT REALY GOT ME INTERESTED IN THIS PROBLEM, IS NOT ONLY THE FACT THAT I HAVE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS WITH ALMOST BEING INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, BUT ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS IS HAVING THE SAME APPARANT PROBLEM WITH HER \"1997 GMC JIMMY.\" IT HAS THE SAME VORTEC V6 ENGINE AS MY TRUCK.

ON OCTOBER 4, 1999 I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK WHEN THE TRUCK GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, JAMMED IN 1ST GEAR.  THE TRUCK WAS TOWED. IT TOOK THE DEALER 10 DAYS TO MAKE A DECISION ON REPAIRING THE TRUCK. THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, AND IT IS STILL A MAJOR HASSLE TO GET IT REPAIRED.  CONTACTED GM AND HAD TO HAVE THEM INTERVENE. HAD THEY OF FIXED THE TRUCK THE PRIOR 5 TIMES IT WAS IN FOR REPAIR THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.  THEY CONTINUALLY DENIED PROBLEMS EXISTED WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS A VORTEX TRUCK I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER EXISTING PROBLEMS WITH THIS YEAR OF TRUCK AND TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  BUT I HAD PROBLEMS WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK AFTER PURCHASE AND EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY WOULD REPAIR SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF FIXING THE TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANNY WAS IN PIECES WHEN IT ARRIVED TO THE DEALER FROM THE TOW TRUCK. THEY STILL DID NOT WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.  THEY WERE TRYING TO FORCE ME TO PAY A PART OF THIS REPAIR.  THEY WERE VERY RUID AND INCOOPERATIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE DEAL. A TOTAL OF 16 DAYS THEY HAD THE TRUCK THIS TIME.  IN OCTOBER OF 98 THEY HAD THE TRUCK FOR 19 DAYS AND STILL COULD NOT FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. EACH TIME I WOULD GET THE TRUCK BACK THEY WOULD SHOW SOME REPAIR FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN MY COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE TRANSMISSION. EACH REPORT REFLECTED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TRUCK NO SHIFTING INTO GEAR FROM 1ST TO 2ND.  THEY GAVE ME A BLOW OFF MEMO FROM GM. STATING THE WHNINING NOISE FROM THIS TRANSMISSION WAS NORMAL. HOWEVER, THEY FAILED TO REALIZE THEIR MEMO RELFECTED PROBLEMS FROM PARK TO GEAR AND FROM N TO REVERSE. MY TRUCK WOULD FAIL TO SHIFT FROM 1ST TO 2ND AND IT WOULD WHINE.
