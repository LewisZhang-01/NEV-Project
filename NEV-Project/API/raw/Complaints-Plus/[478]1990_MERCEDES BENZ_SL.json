        "summary": "THE ELECTRICAL WIRING  IS HARDENED AND BRITTLE AND WIRES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER THAT SHOULD NOT.  I SPENT 30 YEARS IN THE CAR BUSINESS AND FOUND THAT THE SAME PROBLEM HAS BEEN PRESENT IN VOLVO CARS AND MERCEDES.  THE WIRING HARNESS IS SUB OUT TO FRENCH CONTRACTORS AND THE PLASTIC ON THE WIRES HARDENS AND FALLS OFF THE WIRES AND THE VACUUM LINES WHEN IN CONTACT WITH BATTERY ACID EATS THEM UP WHICH WIPES OUT THE DOOR LOCK SYSTEM.  SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE THE INCENTIVE AND BRING THEIR STANDARDS UP--- OR HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THE JOB.  MY FIRST MBZ WAS A 190 SL AND I WAS SHOCKED AT THE AVAILABLE PARTS FROM THE FACTORY--THEY WERE GREAT.  I HAVE HAD MANY MORE OF THESE CARS  AND STILL LOVE THEM.  BUT,  THE GERMANS BUILD AND ENGINEER GREAT CARS,  THEY SHOULD MAKE THE SUBCONTRACTORS BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SHODDY WORKMANSHIP.  DON'T BELIEVE ME?  TALK TO INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOPS.  *JB",
