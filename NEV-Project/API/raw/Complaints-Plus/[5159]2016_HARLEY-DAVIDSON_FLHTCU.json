I PARKED AT A RESTAURANT AND WHEN I CAME BACK OUTSIDE I PULLED UP TO THE STREET AND HAD BRAKES.  I PULLED OUT ONTO THE STREET AND I HAD NO BRAKES WHATSOEVER ON MY BACK BRAKES AND MY FRONT BRAKES WERE DOING SOME KIND OF GRABBY ON OFF THING AT 10MPH.  IT WAS SCARY AS HELL, NO BACK BRAKES AND ALMOST NO FRONT BRAKES.  THE BACK BRAKES JUST WENT DOWN ALL OF THE WAY.    I HAD TO TRAILER THE BIKE 90 MILES BACK TO TULSA.  MY BIKE  IS IN THE SHOP AND THEY ARE SAYING IT IS THE ABS CONTROL UNIT.  I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE THAT A FAILURE OF THE ABS IN THIS FASHION COULD RESULT IN BASICALLY A TOTAL LOSS OF BRAKES.  ABS LIGHT WAS OFF AS WELL, BUT THERE WAS A CODE ON THE BIKE.    HONESTLY I'M PISSED BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING MY RIDE AND IT WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN ANOTHER BIKER WHO RUNS OFF THE ROAD AND KILLED HIMSELF, ETC AND NOBODY WOULD BE THE WISER.    THERE IS NO REASON FOR KIND OF TOTAL FAILURE.  IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.  FAILING BACK TO STANDARD BRAKES IMMEDIATELY IS MUCH BETTER THAN NO BRAKES.      ---HARLEY FIXED THE BRAKES AT NO CHARGE, BUT I FEEL THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AS I'VE READ OF OTHERS WITH SIMILAR ACCOUNTS.  THEY REPLACED THE ABS CONTROL UNIT, WHEEL SPEED SENSOR, AND WHEEL BALL BEARING.",
