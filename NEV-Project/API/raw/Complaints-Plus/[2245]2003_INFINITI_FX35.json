CUSTOMERS ARE BEING TOLD THAT IT IS SAFE TO STILL DRIVE THE CAR, AS LONG AS WE REFRAIN FROM ANYONE BEING IN THE FRONT SEAT. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CAR, AND MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS.

I WANT TO STRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE DUE WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE UNTIL NOW, BUT AT SOME POINT THE BURDEN CANNOT BE PLACED ON THE CUSTOMER. THEY SHOULD BE GIVING LOANER VEHICLES TO THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE HIGH RISK OLDER MODEL CARS.

IT STARTED OVERHEATING WHEN I SLOWED DOWN IN TOWNS AND SUCH...REPLACED MY THERMOSTAT....FLUSHED EVERYTHING....DROVE FOR QUITE A FEW WEEKS MORE WITH NO PROBLEMS...THOUGHT IT WAS SOLVED :/ NOT QUITE. OVERHEATING BEGAN ONCE AGAIN...THIS TIME I HAD MY HEATER GOING AND NOTICED IT GOING COLD THEN WITHIN MINUTES MY TEMP BEGAN RISING. I PULLED RIGHT OVER KNOWING WHAT DAMAGES CAN BE INCURRED. I HAD COOLANT BEING EXPELLED FROM MY SPARE RESERVOIR JUST LIKE THE OTHER INSTANCES. I WAITED FOR IT TO COOL, FILLED IT WITH WATER/COOLANT AND MADE IT A WAYS FURTHER, THEN REPEAT, REPEAT. TOOK MY CAR TO INFINITI OF BEAVERTON WHO TOLD ME THAT MY ISSUE WAS A CRACKED RADIATOR. THEY WANTED 900 FOR IT. REPLACED IT, CAR STILL OVERHEATED. REPLACED WATER PUMP. STILL OVERHEATED. HAD MY CAR TOWED BACK TO INFINITI WHO FAILED TO HAVE A LOANER AVAILABLE (EVEN THOUGH I CALLED A DAY IN ADVANCE AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD). THEY MADE ME RENT A CAR! THEY TOLD ME THEY STILL COULDN'T DIAGNOSE IT AND THAT I HAD TO DRIVE OR HAVE IT TOWED TO A DIFFERENT SHOP AND PAY TO HAVE A 4 GAS HYDROCARBON TEST DONE. WELL SURE ENOUGH A ONE-WAY PINHOLE LEAK IN THE HEAD GASKET NOT DISPLAYING YOUR TYPICAL TRAITS OF GASKET BLOWOUTS...ONLY A SLIGHT RISE IN HYDROCARBONS, BUT ENOUGH TO SHOW IT HAD A LEAK ALLOWING AIR INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH THEN OVERPRESSURIZES MY COOLANT SYSTEM CAUSING THE SPARE RES. TO BE MY RELEASE LOCATION. ONCE AIR IS INTRODUCED AND REPLACES THE COOLANT AN AIR BUBBLE DEVELOPS AND SYSTEM OVERHEATS. WHAT I AM GETTING AT IS THAT INFINITI IS NOT RECOGNIZING THIS AS ANY PROBLEM.

IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE.

I AM JUST WORRIED THAT AFTER MY WARRANTY EXPIRES AND THE SAME PROBLEM ARISES, THE DEALER OR THE MANUFACTURER WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DAMAGES IT MIGHT CAUSE. I HAVE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES TO CORRECT THE BRAKING PROBLEM IT CREATES. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER THE SERVICE, THE SAME PROBLEM OCCUR. THE DEALER KEEPS GIVING ME ANALOGIES ABOUT A WINE GLASS, WATER ON YOUR FINGER TIPS AND RUNNING THEM OVER THE TIP OF THE GLASS....WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM OF THE CAR!  AFTER 3 MONTHS LEASING THE VEHICLE, THE PROBLEM STARTED TO SHOW BUT WAS FIXED. THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS THE WORST. WHEREIN EVEN BACKING UP MADE THE NOISE LIKE THE WHEEL WOULD SEPARATE. THIS WAS REMEDIED WHEN THE CALIPER WAS RECALLED. THE THIRD TIME I TOOK THE VEHICLE, THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE ABS THAT MAKES THE NOISE. I UNDERSTAND THAT ABS APPLIES IN A SUDDEN BRAKE. BUT THIS WHOLE INCIDENT HAPPENS EVEN DRIVING AT 10-15 MPH. ALTHOUGH, EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS, I STILL HAVE TO TAKE MY SUV BACK TO THE DEALER DUE TO THE SAME RATTLING NOISE. THE SERVICE MANAGER KEEPS ON INSISTING THAT THIS IS NORMAL. THIS IS NOT NORMAL IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DO TO MY FRIENDS VEHICLE, WHICH HAS THE SAME YEAR AND MODEL AS I HAVE.   NOT TO MENTION, WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR A 30,000 MILES SERVICE. MY REGULAR MECHANIC FOR MY OTHER CAR NOTICED, THAT THE CABIN FILTER WAS MISSING. HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE VEHICLE AS IF HAS NOT BEEN SERVICED AT ALL DUE TO OIL BEING SO DIRTY. *JB",
