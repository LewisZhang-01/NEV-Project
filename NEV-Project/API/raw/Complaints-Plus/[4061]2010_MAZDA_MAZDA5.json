THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE FEBRUARY AT RANDOM INTERVALS RANGING FROM 4 MONTHS TO 1 WEEK APART BETWEEN INCIDENTS AND IN ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEATHER.  MAZDA'S COMPUTER IS TELLING THEM THAT PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED TO BOTH THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR AT THE SAME TIME, AND THEREFORE THEY SAY THEY CANNOT COME UP WITH ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN THAT I AM PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BRAKE.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  I VIDEO-TAPED THE LAST OCCURRENCE.  THE CAR GOT UP TO 7000 RPM AND THE SUDDEN FORCE OF THE CAR JUMPING INTO GEAR ACTUALLY CAUSED THE CAR TO SLIDE EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN AT A FULL STOP (THIS INSTANCE WAS IN ICY CONDITIONS).  I VIDEO-TAPED THE FACT THAT MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT BECAUSE MY PHONE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT ON IT, THIS WAS TOO DARK TO DISCERN WITH THE DARK INTERIOR OF MY CAR.  MY HUSBAND HAS ALSO BEEN IN THE CAR WHEN THIS HAS HAPPENED AND HAS SEEN THAT MY FOOT IS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR.  THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALER ALSO RODE WITH ME TO ASCERTAIN THAT I AM NOT A TWO-FOOTED DRIVER.  MAZDA IS THROWING THEIR HANDS UP IN THE AIR BECAUSE THEIR COMPUTER WILL NOT PRODUCE A CODE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM, WILL NOT OFFER A RENTAL CAR, WILL NOT OFFER TO REPLACE THE CAR, AND WILL NOT KEEP THE CAR LONG ENOUGH TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM (WHICH THEY SAY IS THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN IDENTIFY IT AND FIX IT).  I EVEN ASKED THEM TO KEEP THE CAR THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED UNTIL THEY COULD REPRODUCE IT, AND INSTEAD THEY INSTALLED A BLACK BOX DEVICE WHICH BASICALLY ENDED UP TELLING THEM NOTHING EXCEPT THAT FORCE WAS BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCELERATOR.   *TR",

THE RESULT OF THIS DESIGN CHANGE IS THAT BOTH MYSELF AND MY WIFE HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR IN THE DARK WITH THE HEADLIGHTS OFF.
