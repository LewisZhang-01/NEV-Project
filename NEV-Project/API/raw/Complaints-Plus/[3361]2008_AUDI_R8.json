        "summary": "I HAD SHOCK FAILURE RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY (VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION), LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT. THIS MATTER WAS DUE TO A KNOWN ISSUE OF AUDI'S LEAKING MAGNETIC SHOCKS THAT HAS BEEN A CONCERN FOR 2008-2010 MODELS WITH A \"MAGNETIC RIDE SUSPENSION\" AS PER MASTER AUDI SERVICE TECHNICIANS.    PLEASE SEE OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME ISSUE:  2008 AUDI R8 = HTTP://GOO.GL/A1OIUN  2009 AUDI R8 = HTTP://GOO.GL/3P75JI  ACTION CSC-10036971-4658 = HTTP://GOO.GL/Y5HLCG  ACTION CSC-10036488-9645 = HTTP://GOO.GL/14VAW3    THE MAGNETIC RIDE SHOCKS WILL PREMATURELY LEAK OIL WHICH LEADS TO SUSPENSION FAILURE. PART OF THE FUNCTION IS TO STIFFEN THE SUSPENSION IF SWITCHED INTO SPORT MODE BUT THE LACK OF OIL FLUID WILL PREVENT IT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. A SIMILAR ISSUE OCCURRED WITH AUDI RS4 AND RS4 LEAKING SHOCKS.    I  DISCOVERED THIS ISSUE WHEN I READ ABOUT THE COMMON ISSUE ON NHTSA. MANY MORE OWNERS WILL NOT KNOW OF THIS COMMON ISSUE. DRIVERS DO NOT EXPECT PREMATURE SUSPENSION FAILURE AND IT IS A SAFETY & HAZARD ISSUE. UNKNOWING OWNERS WOULD EXPECT THE SHOCKS TO NOT FAIL AND CAN SAFELY GO OVER BUMPS OR POT HOLES WITHOUT POSSIBLY LOSING CONTROL OF THE CAR. MOREOVER, FAILED SHOCKS COULD CAUSE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE CAR SINCE IT IS ABSORBING ALL THE VIBRATIONS.     CROSS REFERENCE: NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10036971, 10036488",
