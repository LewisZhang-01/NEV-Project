This is not safe to drive around as the additional slack does not protect me in the event of a crash or accident. I took my car to the dealership to be repaired but was told I needed to book an appointment. The Service Manager simply tugged on the seatbelt until it retracted and told me I was good to go for the time being, which did not satisfy my safety concern. I have not had the seatbelt inspected by any government safety bodies just yet and no warning lights or sounds unless I unclick the seatbelt latch.",
