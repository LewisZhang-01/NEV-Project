A quick search online revealed several testimonies of it exploding while driving 2006 4runner. I contacted Toyota and have a case number with them it is case number 211228002935. They said that because the warranty was expired they can\u2019t do anything, I don\u2019t even care about getting reimbursement for window as much as I care about them addressing this as a real safety issue and recalling it.

I CHECKED FOR RECALLS AND FOUND NONE FOR MY MODEL BUT DID FOR SIMILAR YEAR TUNDRA, SEQUOIA, AND THE TACOMA WHICH IS A SHARED DESIGN WITH MY 4RUNNER. MY TRUCK HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A FRAME REPAIR AT A AFTERMARKET BODY SHOP FOR OVER 4 MONTHS. I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE AND RECEIVED NO HELP. I RECENTLY SEARCHED HOPING TO FIND NEW INFORMATION AND FOUND THAT THE NHTSA HAS OPENED AN INVESTIGATION ON THE FRAME RUST ISSUE. I AM WRITING THIS TO LET YOU KNOW THIS IS A REAL ISSUE AND NEEDS A FRAME REPLACEMENT RECALL. A 2006 MODEL YEAR TRUCK SHOULD NOT NEED A FRAME REPAIR FROM RUST AFTER 12 YEARS OF EXISTENCE AND I BELIEVE TOYOTA IS NEGLIGENT IN RECALLING ALL OTHER TRUCK BASED VEHICLES FOR FRAME RUST WHILE TRYING TO CHEAP OUT AND EXCLUDE THE 4RUNNER.

WHEN I CAME OUT APPROXIMATELY 7-8 MINUTES LATER I SEE THAT MY BACK WINDOW IS COMPLETELY SHATTERED. I AM COMPLETELY SURPRISED AND A LITTLE FREAKED OUT SINCE MY CHILD WAS JUST SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE I ALSO FOUND GLASS. AS I AM CLEANING UP THE GLASS ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF MY CHILD'S PRE-SCHOOL I SMELT SOMETHING BURNING IN THE REAR WINDOW IN THE INSIDE. TURNS OUT MY ELECTRICAL UNIT THAT POWERS MY DEFROSTING HEATER IN THE REAR WINDOW WAS TOTALLY BURNED UP. THE GLASS REPAIR SHOP THAT REPLACED MY WINDOW SO I COULD AT LEAST DRIVE MY CAR SAID THIS COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY WORST AS THERE LOOKED TO BE A SMALL FIRE IN THE BACK PANELING WITHIN THOSE WIRES (THE CONNECTORS WERE FRIED). I JUST BOUGHT MY CAR IN MARCH, LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, SO THIS IS EXTREMELY IRRITATING AND SCARY. I PLAN ON TAKING IT TO TOYOTA SO THEY CAN REVIEW THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM, BUT I HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD BY MY EXTENDED WARRANTY PEOPLE THAT THIS MAY NOT BE A COVERED PROBLEM UNDER MY WARRANTY.

THIS IS NOT A FLOOR MAT OR STICKY GAS PEDAL PROBLEM - THE CAR BRAKES OKAY AND MY FOOT IS OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WHEN IT HAPPENS.

INSTEAD OF HITTING THE LINE OF CARS IN FRONT OF ME I VEERED OFF THE ROAD THROUGH A SNOW BANK.  THE CAR EVENTUALLY STOPPED AFTER TRAVELING ANOTHER ~100FT THROUGH 8\" OF SNOW.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND NO DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE (CAR WAS DRIVABLE AFTERWARDS).  THE POLICE DID RESPOND AND A TOW TRUCK WAS NEEDED TO TOW MY CAR BACK ONTO THE ROAD.  MY ORIGINAL TRAVEL SPEED WAS ~ 40MPH (BEFORE BRAKING).  I SPED UP AFTER BRAKING, BUT I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THE SPEED WHEN I HIT THE BANK.  TOYOTA RAN A DIAGNOSTIC AND RECEIVED SEVERAL ERRORS.  THE ABS WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.  THEY SAID THE PROBLEM MAY HAVE RELATED TO A LOW BATTERY I HAD 6-12 MONTHS EARLIER.  THE LOW BATTERY SOMEHOW DEACTIVATED COMPONENTS OF THE ABS.  I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS EVEN POSSIBLE.  IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT A LOW OR DEAD BATTERY COULD RESULT IN ABS FAILURE I WOULD HAVE HAD THE SYSTEM CHECKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LOW BATTERY INCIDENT.  TOYOTA FIXED THE ABS; HOWEVER, I STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE CAR IS AT REST, BUT NOT IN PARK, IT WILL SOMETIMES LUNGE FORWARD (NOTHING LIKE YOU HEAR ABOUT ON TV, BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME TYPE OF POWER SURGE), THERE IS ALSO AN OCCASIONAL BUZZING NOISE FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER AREA WHEN THE BRAKES ARE DEPRESSED (EVEN IN PARK).    FINALLY, I HAVE DRIVEN SEVERAL SUVS AND SMALL TRUCKS.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A VEHICLE THAT WILL LOOSE TRACTION AS EASILY AS THIS VEHICLE LOOSES TRACTION.  SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG.  I PLAN TO CONTACT TOYOTA TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE ABS ONCE AGAIN.  I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO REPORT THESE ISSUES TO THE NHTSA OR I WOULD HAVE REPORTED THE PROBLEM A YEAR AGO.

THE THROTTLE CONTROL MODULE WAS CHANGED AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE FIXED UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN FEBRUARY 2007 WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD APPROXIMATELY 9800 MILES.  THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE SHOP FROM FEBRUARY UNTIL AUGUST 2007.  TOYOTA REPLACED THE THROTTLE CONTROL MODULE AGAIN, THEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND THE ENGINE CONTROL COMPUTER, ALL OF WHICH DID NOT FIX THE VEHICLE. THEY FINALLY REPLACED THE ENTIRE WIRE HARNESS IN AUGUST 2007 WHICH HAS THE VEHICLE WORKING AGAIN.  WE HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO RE-PURCHASE THE VEHICLE FROM US BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THIS VEHICLE. IF THIS LOSS OF POWER WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT! TOYOTA HAS REFUSED TO RE-PURCHASE OR REPLACE THE VEHICLE.

ON AUGUST 4 2007 I BEGAN AN ATV RIDE/CAMPING TRIP WITH TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WAS PLANNED TO GO THROUGH 8/11. WE STOPPED FOR LUNCH ON DAY 1 AND AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES I HEARD A STRANGE HISSING SOUND COMING FROM MY ATV. I REMOVED THE GAS CAP AT WHICH TIME LARGE VOLUME OF FUEL WAS EJECTED (LIKE A GEYSER) ABOUT 12-18\" STRAIGHT UP. THANKFULLY I WAS STILL WEARING EYE PROTECTION BECAUSE THE FUEL SPRAYED MY FACE, HAND, ARMS AND TORSO. I INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT THE VENT HOSE LEADING FROM THE GAS TANK MUST BE CLOGGED OR PINCHED ALLOWING THE FUEL TANK TO OVER PRESSURIZE. I CHECKED THE VENT HOSE AND IT WAS CLEAR AND THEN POSITIONED IT SO IT COULD BE OBSERVED. THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP THE GAS TANK CONTINUED TO HISS AND BUILD OF PRESSURE AND FUEL WOULD CONTINUOUSLY LEAK, BUBBLE, SHOOT OUT OF THE VENT HOSE BOTH WHEN THE ATV WAS MOVING OR NOT. WHEN THE ATV WAS IDLING AND PRESSURE WAS BUILT UP, I WOULD SLOWLY RELEASE PRESSURE IN THE TANK BY SLOWLY OPENING THE GAS CAP THE ATV WOULD DIE. BROUGHT THE ATV TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT FIX IT. I RELATED TO THE AUTHORIZED POLARIS DEALERSHIP THAT MY ATV IDLING IN THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT FAIRLY REPLICATE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAUSED THE FUEL PROBLEM. I AM PREPARED TO PROVIDE YOUR AGENCY WITH SWORN STATEMENTS FROM WITNESSES, PHOTOS, MORE DETAILED DATES, TIMES AND NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS I ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH AT THE POLARIS DEALERSHIP AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT BUT CONSIDERING HOW MY CONCERNS WERE BRUSHED ASIDE BY THE MANUFACTURE UNDER THE GUISE OF BEING \"UNABLE TO REPLICATE\" IT COULD BE WIDE SPREAD. IT GOES WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM PRESENTS A VERY REAL DANGER TO CONSUMERS. THANK YOU, IN ADVANCE, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER. *TR",
