I had it towed to the dealership, they stated it was a bad cell in the battery and installed a new one. Then on Nov. 2020, once again had a dead battery, again no prior warning. I called and got a jump, took the car back to the dealership, they checked it and said I must have left a light on all night because it was completely drained. They put a 3.5 hour charge on it, check the charging system and said all was fine. Then again on 10-19-21  the battery was dead again. At that point I was pissed and just went to the parts store to get a new battery. Upon opening my hood to replace the battery I found so much corrosion on the top of the battery, cleaned it off the best I could, upon disconnecting the battery positive terminal I found the post had lifted out of the battery causing the corrosion all over the battery. I went to the dealership, they told me they were not responsible for corrosion, they did what they call a corrosion maintenance to clean the terminal, offered me a $55 credit because they said the battery was 3 years old and they would have to prorate it. Which they hadn't as of 10-23-2021. It was a 84 month battery. While there they also said my oil pan gasket was seeping and would need replaced and the front brakes will need replaced soon. I haven't even had the car 4 years, it has 15,300 miles approximately. Definitely some problems with these cars and Toyota needs to take responsibility .  I bought a extended warranty, but seems none of this is covered as they say it is normal wear and tear. Never had to replace brakes on a car less then 4 yrs old.

Then after 50k miles, I started having odd lighting issues\u2026both headlight bulbs had to be replaced within 3 weeks of each other and one high beam bulb, and then my tail lights went out! Then I would occasionally have trouble starting the car and with a natural gas smell, rotten eggs. Which could be a catalytic converter or fuel pump issue but can also be the battery. Well, my Rav was in the driveway with a dead battery and with no tail lights and had been sitting there for a month since I mainly drive our Sienna.My Rav just caught on fire and was completely destroyed. No one was hurt but if the Sienna had been out there it would\u2019ve caught on fire and it burned the garage door\u2026Rav totaled!

There were no warning lights ever, not even for the dead battery\u2019s. And less than 6 months prior to the fire, it was serviced at my Toyota dealer and they said all was good.

Unfortunately, they did not record any malfunctioning Code (Exhibit 2).  While returning home on March 21, 2021, the AWD warning light did not come on. A few days later, these warning lights came on again, and that forced me to visit the local Toyota Dealer, Fitzgerald, for inspection again. They diagnosed the problem to Code P0456 (Exhibits 3-4).

At 3 years and 3 months  from purchase,  in October, 2020,   my daughter took it into the Toyota dealership, in the morning,  for a routine oil change.  She hasn't had any problems with the car,  and has only had it serviced at the Toyota dealership.  She drove it in,  and got a ride home,  and was waiting for the call to come pick up her car. In the afternoon, the dealership called to say her 2017 RAV4 have severe engine damage from the batter exploding, while it had been sitting at the dealership. They told her it was 3 months past the warranty, and Toyota wouldn't pay for any repairs. It sat at Toyota for a week, until our auto insurance representative went and looked. He called us to say that: \" he had never seen soo much engine damage.\"  He told us that our auto insurance was -- \"totaling the car,  that the engine was unrepairable,  and that they were going to take it to the auto dump.\"  Our insurance company hauled it away, and determined its remaining value and paid us, in October, 2020.  My daughter chose a new car, we purchased it for her, with the insurance money, covering part of the purchase. It cost us thousands more, to cover the cost of the new replacement car.   I told my daughter that we had bought her a \"dud of a gift\",   and would pay for the new car. Our auto insurance confirmed what the dealership said, that the battery had exploded.",

TIME, AND OTHER SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE GAS LEAKAGE WITH NO CHARGE. BOTH GAS LEAKAGE ARE ALL THE SAME, 60 DAYS APART, WERE ALL FROM THE REAR, BOTTOM, DRIVER SIDE OF THE CAR, THERE WAS A GAS PUDDLE ON MY INCLINED DRIVEWAY.   AFTER I CHECKED TOYOTA OWNER'S WARRANTY RIGHTS NOTIFICATION BOOKLETS - FEDERAL EMISSION CONTROL WARRANTY ' 'CHARCOAL CANISTER' IS CLEARLY UNDER TOYOTA WARRANTY PARTS LIST ' WITHIN 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES.   APPARENTLY, TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID MODEL -'GAS LEAKAGE' CAUSED BY DEFECTED EVAPORATIVE SYSTEM, CAN'T PARKING ON INCLINED OR UPHILL DRIVEWAY WITH MORE THAN HALF TANK OF GAS.    I CALLED AND SENT TWO CLAIM LETTERS DATED ON 6/25/2019 AND 8/26/2019, REQUEST TOYOTA REFUND MY $837.72 ' FOR 1ST. TIME REPAIRED COST THAT PAID ON 5/7/2019.   TOYOTA HAS DECLINED MY CLAIMS, REFUSED REFUNDING MY PAYMENT OF $837.72, WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH TOYOTA'S UNETHICAL, FRAUD NOTES ON THE INVOICE ' SO CALLED 'GAS IS OVERFILLED'.  TOYOTA SHIRKS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CUSTOMER IN ORDER NOT COVER THE VEHICLE DEFECTIVE. INTENTIONALLY VIOLATE THEIR WARRANTY POLICY.  WE HAVE BEEN WRONGLY, UNFAIRLY TREATED. SO WE ASK THE NHTSA, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER, MONITOR THE TOYOTA CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE, AND REFUND MY $837.72 ASAP.  THERE ARE SOME OTHER SIMILAR GAS LEAKAGE CLAIM CASES OF THE RAV4 HYBRID MODEL.  IT'S VERY DANGER TO DRIVE WITH THE GAS LEAKAGE, CAN GET FIRE. JUSTICE IS MATTERS.",

I THEN REALIZED WHY THE LTP LIGHT NEVER CAME ON BEFORE I REPLACED WITH SPARE. I TOOK THE RAV4 TO PASADENA TOYOTA TO RUN THE DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO FIND OUT WHY LTP LIGHT NEVER CAME ON WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON A FLAT. THE DIAGNOSTIC FOUND 'NOTHING WRONG' AND THE SYSTEM DIDN'T RECORD ANYTHING. THEY ALSO TOLD ME THE TIRE SUFFERED 'RUN FLAT DAMAGE' AND NOT REPAIRABLE. I THEN CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SVC. CASE # 1902010530, CASE MANAGER DEREK. DEREK JUST INFORMED ME ON 2/11/19 THAT THE LTP LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON WHEN THE TIRE SUDDEN LOST PRESSURE AND TURN FLAT (OWNER'S MANUAL PG 571). I ASKED HIM WHY THE LIGHT DIDN'T COME ON WHEN I DROVE IT ON FLAT FOR A WHILE TO CAUSE THE RUN FLAT DAMAGE. WASN'T THE TIRE PRESSURE LOW ENOUGH WHEN IT'S FLAT? HE SAID THE LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON WHEN IT'S FLAT. THIS SOUNDS VERY DANGEROUS IF THE WARNING LIGHT DOESN'T SEND OUT SIGNAL EVEN WHEN IT'S FLAT.  HOWEVER PASADENA TOYOTA SVC ADVISOR TOLD ME THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO CHECK THE PRESSURE EVERY 30 SECONDS. THIS CONFLICTS WITH WHAT DEREK TOLD ME.  IF I ONLY DROVE WITH FLAT FOR 30 SECONDS LOCALLY IT WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED 'RUN FLAT DAMAGE'. I WAS ESPECIALLY DRIVING SLOW LOCALLY ON 1/31/19 BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC. I MUST HAVE DRIVEN IT MORE THAN 30 SECONDS (TO CAUSE THE RUN FLAT DAMAGE) BUT THE SYSTEM FAILED TO DETECT IT AND SENT ME THE WARNING.

ON PAGE 644 OF THE 2017 RAV4 OWNERS MANUAL THERE IS A DIRECT REFERENCE TO A FULL SIZE WHEEL STORAGE AREA IN ADDITION ON PAGES 642 AND 645 TO A TEMPORARY TIRE USE, ETC.       THE RAV4 TEMPORARY TIRE IS NOT THE SAME CIRCUMFERENCE AN FULL SIZE TIRES; THUS, THE TOYOTA CONSUMER DEPARTMENT STATED THAT DUE TO THIS SITUATION, TEMPORARY TIRES MUST NOT BE MOUNTED ON THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  IF THERE IS A FLAT TIRE ON THE FRONT OF THE RAV4, A PERSON MUST MOUNT A REAR TIRE ON THE FRONT THEN MOUNT THE TEMPORARY TIRE ON THE RELOCATED FULL SIZE TIRE ON THE REAR.

HIS DEATH RESULTED FROM HIS NEW TOYOTA RAV4 KEYLESS CAR NOT TURNING OFF, ULTIMATELY FLOODING HIS APARTMENT WITH THE DEADLY GAS.     HE WAS FOUND IN HIS BED, DEAD, ON SEPTEMBER 7TH, AROUND 10:25 A.M.  HIS TWO CATS HAD ALSO EXPIRED. THE TOYOTA RAV4 WAS STILL RUNNING ' 14 HOURS FOLLOWING HIS RETURN HOME FROM A FAMILY DINNER.  THE CARBON MONOXIDE READING INSIDE HIS CAR WAS 330.  THE RESIDENCE REGISTERED AT 53.  MORE THAN TWO HOURS AFTER DISCOVERING MY FATHER'S BODY, THE CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS IN THE HOUSE WERE STILL 30.  THIS AFTER DOORS AND WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND A LARGE FAN PROVIDED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS USED TO PUSH THE AIR THRU THE RESIDENCE.    THE CARBON MONOXIDE TRAVELED TO THE NEIGHBOR'S ADJOINING GARAGE AND THRU HER APARTMENT WALLS. MORE THAN ONE HOUR AFTER MY FATHER WAS DISCOVERED, THE NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS WERE STILL 40 ' REQUIRING A HOSPITAL VISIT.    THE DETECTIVE ON THE SCENE FOUND THE TOYOTA KEY FOB ON THE DINING TABLE ' JUST YARDS FROM THE ATTACHED GARAGE WHERE THE CAR WAS PARKED.    THE CAR WAS LEASED IN JULY OF 2017. IT WAS DELIVERED IN MID-AUGUST 2017, BY TOYOTA DEALER. AT NO TIME DURING THE SALE OR UPON DELIVERY, WAS IT IMPRESSED UPON MY FATHER THAT THE KEYLESS CARS PRESENTED A CARBON MONOXIDE SAFETY CONCERN. AT NO TIME WAS MY FATHER OFFERED AN OPTION FOR A 'KEYED' CAR.    THERE WERE NO WARNING SYSTEMS ON THE CAR TO SUGGEST THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING. IT SEEMS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT TOYOTA HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WITH ADDITIONAL WARNING DEVICES FOR DRIVERS, AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF AFTER A SET TIME, OR AT THE VERY LEAST, BE REQUIRED TO EMPLOY A POLICY THAT SUGGESTS A KEY IGNITION WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SENIOR DRIVERS.

BOTH TIMES GOING STRAIGHT. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAD A SAFETY INSPECTOR FROM TOYOTA COME OUT AND RUN TESTS- THEY GAVE ME MY CAR BACK AND SAID I WOULD HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE TEST WITHIN 30 DAYS.

THERE WAS NOT A CAR IN FRONT OF MINE, BUT A CAR WAS STOPPED IN A MEDIAN TO MY LEFT FACING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF MY CAR.  I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT MY RAV 4 APPARENTLY SENSED THAT CAR WHEN IT CAME TO A SUDDEN DEAD STOP.  I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO MY CAR AND THOUGHT THE ENGINE HAD SHUT OFF.  A PASSENGER WITH ME, WHO IS A WITNESS TO THIS EVENT, IS AN OWNER OF A RAV 4 SE WITHOUT THE SAFETY SENSE/PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM.  WE WERE SHOOK UP BY THIS BECAUSE HAD THERE BEEN A CAR OR SEMI TRUCK TRAILER BEHIND US, WE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR EVEN KILLED.    I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO THE DEALER, TOYOTA OF WARREN, WHERE WE PURCHASED THE NEW CAR, AND AFTER A DAY IN SERVICE, THEY SAID THE CAR WAS WORKING FINE WITH THE SENSORS ALIGNED CORRECTLY.  I WAS TO LET THEM KNOW IF THIS SITUATION OCCURRED AGAIN, AND IT DID.    IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, AGAIN WHILE USING THE CRUISE CONTROL AND WITH NO CAR IN FRONT OF MINE, A CAR IN THE PASSING LANE WENT BY ME AT APPROXIMATELY 80 MPH TO MY 65 MPH.  MY CAR CAME TO A DEAD STOP.  THANK GOD THERE WAS NOT A CAR BEHIND ME AT THE TIME, OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE OCCURRED.    AFTER DOING RESEARCH ON THIS SAFETY PROBLEM THAT WE EXPERIENCED, WE FOUND A NUMBER OF REPORTS CONCERNING THIS VERY SITUATION HAPPENING WITH THEIR RAV 4'S COMING TO SUDDEN STOPS FOR NO REASON. THESE REPORTS OF THIS VERY PROBLEM WERE REPORTED TO TOYOTA WITH NO RESOLUTION.  THESE OWNERS ALSO SOLD THEIR CARS AT A LOSS BECAUSE OF SAFETY ISSUES.
