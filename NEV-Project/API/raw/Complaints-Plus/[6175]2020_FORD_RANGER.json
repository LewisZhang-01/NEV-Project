Per Ford personnel, at least 96 Ford vehicles (as of 10/26/2021) are awaiting the replacement cameras, and Ford Service Personnel at the local Ford Dealership have indicated that \"they have replaced a lot of these cameras\".  When this camera malfunctions, the vehicle LOSES 100% of FIVE (5) of its key Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS):  1. Adaptive Cruise Control (there is NO cruise control whatsoever without this camera) 2. Forward Collision Warning 3. Automatic Emergency Braking 4. Lane Departure Warning 5. Lane Keeping Assistance  This is a CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE with the vehicle.  The ONLY safety features that work are the Blind Spot Detection in the Side Mirrors, and the Front and Rear Parking Sensors -- the latter of which are useless in high-speed highway driving.  My camera failed on or about August 21, 2021, and I am still waiting for an update on when the part will be available.  The car can be operated without the ADAS system, but its safety is significantly and materially degraded.  The replacement of the camera is a simple operation, but the parts are not available, and no one at Ford knows when they will become available.  There are two (2) warning alarms which are audible and visible on the dash when the camera fails.  Both can be \"accepted\" via the \"OK\" button on the steering wheel.  Each time the car is started, both alarms activate shortly after the car warms up.",

        "summary": "I was in the driveway of my home. My family had entered and closed the front passenger door and opened the rear driver door. I opened and then closed the driver front door which caused the rear window with the glass sider to completely shatter. The vehicle had at the time 9,686 miles on it. It had no damage visible prior to this and there were no signs of any vandalism or other activity that would have caused this situation to occur. No vehicle alarm was activated either that would have indicated forced entry. In addition to our personal security system on our property providing no indication of such. This window should not have shattered. The cost to replace this window is $985 plus installation by a glass repair company. I contacted Ford Customer Care and was referred to a dealership service center to get the vehicle inspected, file a claim and then be referred to a glass shop. After contacting a couple of dealerships, was able to clear away glass to safely drive this vehicle to a third dealership to complete this process. Shattered, tempered glass from a rear window is difficult to clear and sharp. I then learned I was denied the claim of coverage under warranty because there are no other complaints regarding glass breakage. I am lodging this complaint with a relevant third party to ensure this is not true and if others have this issue of a defective window, they are not denied a true and substantial claim as I was. I will be attempting to use the coverage the dealership I bought the vehicle from to cover the cost of this repair. I don't believe this is an insurance claim. It is defective equipment from Ford on a new vehicle. It's a statement on how Ford backs the quality of their vehicles. I will be considering my vehicle purchases going forward.",
