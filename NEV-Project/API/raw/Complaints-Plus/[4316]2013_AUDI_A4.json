At that time the check engine light was not illuminated.  I was able to get off the highway and drive home about 2 miles away from when the misfires first occurred.  The police did not get involved as I was able to return home.  The following week the car was towed to my mechanic where it was diagnosed that cylinder 3 had a problem. At that time the check engine light illuminated.  He recommended that I tow my car to the Audi dealership as they have better availability of parts.  The dealer took apart the engine and diagnosed a broken piston ring which destroyed many other parts of the engine. The engine had to be replaced with a new one from the factory.   Audi should be held accountable for catastrophic engine failures that may result in injury to others due to poor engine design.",

My initial reaction was to hit the breaks and slow down. My daughter was ejected from her seat into the passenger seat head first and then landed on the floor with her booster seat on top of her. I pulled over and checked the seat belt and it would not latch. I had to drive her home unrestrained!! A few days later, different child experienced a similar situation with the middle seat. This is a concern because if the seatbelts failed during a car accident, my children\u2019s lives were at risk. Repeated risk of the lives of children by ignoring this common issue. How many lives will it take to be protected? Minus the fear of being unable to afford repairs, or to get the vehicle in to the repair shop? As this has happened to 2/5 buckles in a matter of days, how do I know all of the buckles are not defective? Why are we repeatedly waiting for the tally marks on lives lost before we protect our children? When is it worth a single life EVEN HARMED because the life saving device has failed to keep us safe? Our family is so strict about seatbelt safety, how can this even be a gamble that anyone is willing to take? Furthermore, how do I explain to my children that this \u201cvery important\u201d seatbelt that I check every time they kids get into a vehicle.. how am I supposed to explain that this very important piece of equipment may or may not be there when you need it and they still must wear it?I have read hundreds of forums reporting the same failures in both Audi and VW. I have contacted Audi Denver and am waiting on a quote. I am a nurse and my husband is unemployed due to the economy downturn. We are financially stretched to our absolute limits, raising children and we will not have the means to fix the failed seat belt buckles. Any safety failure like this or with airbags should be 100% under manufacturers warranty for the LIFE of the vehicle.",
