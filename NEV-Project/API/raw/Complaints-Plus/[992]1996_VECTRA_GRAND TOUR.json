I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, PLACED THE UNIT IN PARK AND THEN BACK INTO DRIVE. THE BRAKE RELEASED AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GET A SERVICE AGENCY TO CHECKOUT THE PROBLEM.  NOTHING TURNED UP IN THE CHECKOUT.  I DID NOTICE ON YOUR SITE THAT THERE WAS A NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 94V183000 THAT COVERS MY PROBLEM.  I BOUGHT THIS UNIT USED BUT HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL NOTICE. SHOULD I EXPECT ONE?  *JB",
