IT HAPPENED TO ME APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES WHILE DRIVING AT VERY LOW SPEED, DURING STOP AND GO TRAFFIC AND AS I WAS ENTERING A PARKING SPOT.  THREE SUCH EVENTS OCCURRED WITHIN TEN MINUTES WHILE INCHING MY WAY TO MERGE AND ENTER THE QUEEN'S MIDTOWN TUNNEL IN NY. EACH TIME I MANAGED TO STOP THE CAR BY LEANING VERY HEAVILY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND MOVING THE TRANSMISSION INTO THE NEUTRAL POSITION.  THE DEALER UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, AND THE CAR WAS IN HIS SHOP FOUR TIMES FOR OVER 20 DAYS. CADILLAC CLAIMS THAT THEY UNAWARE OF ANY SUDDEN ENGINE ACCELERATION PROBLEM. THE LATEST PROPOSAL THAT CADILLAC OFFERED IS TO INSTALL A DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE IN THE CAR WITH THE HOPE THAT THE FAULT WILL SHOW UP. IN THE MEANWHILE CADILLAC EXPECTS ME TO DRIVE THE CAR, ENDANGERING MYSELF, INNOCENT PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER FELLOW DRIVERS.",
