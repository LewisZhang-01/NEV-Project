ON THE WAY TO WORK A LOUD WHINING NOISE CAME FROM UNDER THE HOOD. AS I WAS DRIVING ON A VERY BUSY STREET, THE CAR STARTED TO ACCELERATE AND DECELERATE RANDOMLY WHILE IN DRIVE. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD ALSO OCCASIONALLY ILLUMINATE. SEVERAL MECHANICS COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG, UNTIL I TOOK THE CUBE TO A MECHANIC THAT KNEW ABOUT THE MANY FAILURES THE NISSAN CVT TRANSMISSION WAS HAVING. I WAS TOLD THEN THAT NISSAN HAD CREATED A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH THE CVT FAILURE; OF WHICH I WAS NEVER INFORMED BY NISSAN. EVEN THOUGH I CONTINUE TO RECEIVE EMAILS AND ADS FOR THE COMPANY.    THE LETTER FROM NISSAN STATES THAT THE WARRANTY ON THE CVT WILL BE EXTENDED. \"FIRST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE REGARDING YOUR OVERALL COST OF OWNERSHIP WE HAVE DOUBLED THE WARRANTY PERIOD FOR THE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION IN YOUR NISSAN.: IT ALSO STATES \"10 YEARS/120,000 MILES, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.\"   MY NISSAN CUBE IS CURRENTLY SEVEN YEARS OLD. I HAVE OVER 128,000 MILES. I NEVER RECEIVED A COPY OF THIS LETTER. I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN FEBRUARY 2010 AND THIS LETTER STATES THE END OF THIS REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM ENDED 7/31/2010!  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME? MY CAR IS NOT 10 YEARS OLD!  I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR OVER TWO MONTHS NOW. I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OUT OF POCKET. ALSO IN THIS LETTER STATES \"A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OWNERS OF EARLY MODELS EQUIPPED WITH CVTS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST OF THE REPAIR OF TRANSMISSION AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.\"  DOES THIS COVER MY VEHICLE?   THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA ABOUT THE CVT; THE ID #10919979 AND #10587829 AND THEIR WERE MORE LISTED HER WITH THE NHTSA.  NISSAN CASE #26415319",
