NO TRANSMISSION. NO WARNING. COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF MACHINE. IF I HAD BEEN DOING INTERSTATE SPEEDS OR ON A MUCH BUSIER HIGHWAY, I WOULD HAVE BEEN REAR-ENDED AND MOST LIKELY EJECTED OVER THE HANDLEBARS AND QUITE POSSIBLY EVEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THE VERY ABRUPT STOP CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SOMEONE BEHIND ME ON ANOTHER SPYDER WHO RECOGNIZED THAT I WAS IN TROUBLE. THE TRANSMISSION WAS BROKEN INTO PIECES. MY 2013 IS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BRP AND WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THEIR RESPONSE. THERE ARE STILL 2013 HEAT ISSUE RECALL BIKES WHICH ARE BEING SOLD, THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE RECALL PERFORMED. MY BIKE WAS JUST SERVICED AT 14,000 MILES. THIS NEEDS TO BE REPORTED AND LOOKED AT SO OTHERS DO NOT GET INTO A LIFE-ENDING INCIDENT BECAUSE OF TOTAL MACHINE SHUTDOWN WHILE THE BIKE IS OPERATIONAL.",

FOR THE LAST YEAR OR BETTER, I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE LIGHT REMAINING ON ONCE THE CYCLE ENGINE IS OFF.  SECONDLY, THE MOTORCYCLE IS CONSTANTLY GOING INTO 'LIMP MODE' WHILE RIDING. (VSS FAULT).  THE MOTORCYCLE DECREASES IN SPEED APPROXIMATELY TO A MAXIMUM 70 MPH.  LASTLY, THE 'CRUISE CONTROL' WILL NOT SET.  THESE PROBLEMS ARE VERY EMBARRASSING TO SAY THE LEAST AND IT POSES A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IN PROCEEDING TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH, IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ROUGHLY NINETY-SEVEN (97) FORMAL COMPLAINTS MADE IN REGARDS TO 2013 CAN AM SPYDER, MOST INCLUDED THE SAME ISSUES LISTED HERE. THAT WAS QUITE ASTONISHING TO ME.   IN ALL OF MY FRUSTRATION, I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS AND VISITS TO NEW ORLEANS POWER SPORTS LOCATION.   THE RESULTS HAVE ALL BEEN MET WITH UNCONVINCING DETAILS.  TELEPHONE CALLS HAVE GONE UNANSWERED, SPECULATIONS WERE MADE, ACCUSATIONS MADE WITHOUT PROPER DIAGNOSES.  I AM UNAWARE IF THE MOTORCYCLE HAS BEEN THROUGH A DIAGNOSTICS TEST AT NEW ORLEANS POWER SPORT.   IN ADDITION, IT WAS LEARNED THERE WERE TWO RECALLS MADE: (1) 15V095000 FOR ENGINE; (2) 13V38600 FOR BRAKES AND HYDRAULICS.  RECALL (1) WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY THE HEATING SHIELDS WERE REPLACED.  HOWEVER, RECALL (2) WAS NOT MADE KNOWN UNTIL RECENTLY.       AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH ALL OF THIS, IT APPEARS THAT THE DEALERSHIP IS UNAWARE OF CURRENT UPDATES ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY SERVICE.  NEVERTHELESS, I AM AT THE END OF THE ROAD!  AT THIS POINT, I AM NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!  THE WIRING HARNESS WAS REPLACED. UPDATED 08/04/16. *JB",
