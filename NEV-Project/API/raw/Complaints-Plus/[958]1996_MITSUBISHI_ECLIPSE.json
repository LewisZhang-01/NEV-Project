UPON RECEIVING MY CAR I HEARD A CHIRPING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE WHICH THEY TOLD ME WAS THE TIMING BELT WAS NEW AND NEEDED TO BE BROKEN IN, WHICH I TOOK THEIR WORD FOR.  WITHIN THE FOLLOWING MONTH THE CHIRPING BECAME LOUDER AND LOUDER TO THE POINT I CALLED AND REQUESTED THEY LOOK AT IT AGAIN.  ON THE WAY TO THE DEALER MY CAR JUST STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT .  AFTER LIFTING THE HOOD I NOTICED THE TIMING BELT COVER SPLIT OPEN ON THE TOP REVEALING THE TIMING BELT WAS NOT ON PROPERLY.  AFTER TOWING MY CAR TO THE DEALER A QUICK INSPECTION CONCLUDED THAT MY CRANK PULLEY HAS \"WALKED\" INTO THE TIMING BELT COVER BURNING A HOLE THROUGH IT CAUSING THE DISASSEMBLING OF THE TIMING UNIT AND MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE HEADS, PISTONS, ETC...I ASKED THE MECHANIC WHY WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR IN JUST  A LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH AGO THEY DIDN'T LET ME KNOW MY CRANK PULLEY HAD SUCH SIGNIFICANT WEAR.  HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL A CRANK PULLEY IS GOING BAD.  I DID RESEARCH OF MY OWN AND FOUND OUT THIS IS HAPPENING TO MOST ECLILPSE, ALL YEARS AND THAT THERE IS A WAY TO TELL IF THE CRANK PULLEY IS GOING BAD BY MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT SIDE TO SIDE MAKING SURE IT MEET THE MANUFACTURER REQUIREMENTS.  OBVIOUSLY THE CRANK PULLEY HAD VERY SIGNIFICANT WEAR SEEING THAT THE PULLEY CAME APART.  I DID RESEARCH ON THIS MATTER AND FOUND OUT MITSUBISHI KNOWS THESE PARTS ARE DEFECTED BUT COVERS MOST OF THEM UNDER WARRANTY SO IT BRINGS DOWN THE NUMBERS.  I FEEL THE REPAIRS SHOULD BE COVERED AND WOULD LIKE TO OPEN AND INVESTIGATION ON \"CRANKPULLEY/SHAFT WALKING\" HOPEFULLY LEADING TO A RECALL. THANK YOU.",
