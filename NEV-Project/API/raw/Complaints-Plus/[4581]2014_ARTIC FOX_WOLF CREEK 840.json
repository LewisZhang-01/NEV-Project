        "summary": "I WAS ASSURED MY TRUCK CAMPER WAS SAFE AND LEGAL WHEN IN FACT IT WAS AT LEAST 1200 LBS ABOVE THE LEGAL LIMIT AS SOLD AND EMPTY.    I WAS TOLD THAT MY TIRES, SUSPENSION, BRAKES AND SHOCKS WERE FINE WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE INADEQUATE.    ON THE 3RD DAY AND THE FIRST TIME ON A DIRT ROAD THE VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED BY ROCKING VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE-TO-SIDE WHICH CAUSE THE REAR DRIVER'S SUPPORT POST TO HIT THE GROUND.    WE WERE FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE A MORE SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  WE HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT WE WERE OVERLOADED BECAUSE THE STICKER INDICATED THE CAMPER WEIGHT WAS ONLY 2300 LBS WHEN IN FACT, ASSUMING MY F250 WEIGHS IN AT 5600 LBS, THE CAMPER WAS AT LEAST TWICE THE ADVERTISED WEIGHT.    AT THE PRESENT TIME I CANNOT REMOVE THE CAMPER AND I CANNOT LEGALLY DRIVE MY TRUCK.    HERE'S IS WHAT THE DEALER SAID IN A BBB COMPLAINT IN RESPONSE:  \"NOT ONLY WAS THE CAMPER IN THEIR CARE, CUSTODY AND CONTROL, BUT THEY WERE ADMITTEDLY DRIVING IT THROUGH A STREAM. WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE HOW FAST THEY WERE GOING, HOW DEEP THE 'SMALL STREAM' WAS, HOW MUCH GEAR THEY HAD LOADED IN THE CAMPER OR ANY OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THEIR ACCIDENTWE WERE 800 MILES AWAY! REGARDLESS, OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT THE CAMPER IS IN PROPER WORKING CONDITION, THE TRUCK HE DECIDES TO USE TO HAUL IT WITH, HOW AND WHERE THEY DRIVE IT, HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY PUT IN IT AND WHERE THEY TAKE IT ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY HIS RESPONSIBILITY.\" [DEALERSHIP OWNER].  *TR",
