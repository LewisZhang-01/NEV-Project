TODAY THEY TOLD HER THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR BUT THE COMPUTER DID SHOW AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE.  WE CALLED GM AND TOLD THEM THE PROBLEM AND THEY WILL SPEAK WITH DEALERSHIP TOMORROW.

IT STATES THAT IF THE MODULE EXPERIENCES AN ELECTRICAL SHORT, THE VEHICLE COULD STALL, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.
