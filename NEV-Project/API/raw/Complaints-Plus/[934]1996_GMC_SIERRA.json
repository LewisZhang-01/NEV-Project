WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT I HEARD A SWISHING SOUND IN THE HEATER CORE AND THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LOW ON ANTI FREEZE AND THAT MY REPAIR FACILITY COULD FIX THE AIR BAG; BUT AS IT TURNS OUT THE CLOCK SPRING IN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS BAD AND I COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET THE AIR BAG FIXED. THE SWISHING SOUND WAS CAUSED BY AIR IN THE COOLING SYSTEM DUE TO A LEAKING INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET; IT HAD TO BE REPLACED FOR 600.00 $. A BRAKE LINE RUSTED OUT (YES I KNOW IT'S AN OLD TRUCK), THE FUEL LINES ARE RUSTING AND WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED SOON, AND THE OIL COOLER LINES ARE LEAKING BECAUSE GM VEHICLES HAVE FLUID LINES THAT ARE PRONE TO FAILURE.       THE WIND SHIELD WIPERS DON'T ALWAYS TURN ON WHEN IT'S RAINING BECAUSE OF CRACKED SOLDER JOINTS IN THE CONTROL MODULE AND I REPLACED A HEATER/FAN MOTOR. I PULLED MY ABS FUSE AND DISABLED THE SYSTEM BECAUSE MY ABS WAS ACTIVATING ON DRY PAVEMENT AT LOW SPEEDS AND CAUSING AN INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCE; A REAL DANGER IN PARKING LOTS WHERE A CHILD COULD RUN OUT IN FRONT OF MY TRUCK. I DON'T HAVE A GRAND TO REPLACE RUSTED HUBS AND SENSORS TO MAKE MY ABS WORK AGAIN.      THE DRIVERS SIDE CAST METAL DOOR HANDLE BROKE AND I REPLACED IT MYSELF WITH A DEALER PART FOR 80.00$ ONE WOULD HATE TO BE IN A WRECK AND HAVE THE HANDLE FAIL WHEN THAT DOOR IS THE ONLY EXIT IN AN EMERGENCY!    I'M ON MY THIRD FUEL PUMP AND FORTH FUEL PUMP SENDING UNIT WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I'M WRITING THIS COMPLAINT. MY TRUCK COULD STALL OUT IN TRAFFIC AT ANY TIME AND I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE OR CONFIDENT DRIVING IT; I FEEL IT'S A BAD DESIGN AND A SAFETY ISSUE. THE PUMP AND SENDING UNIT ARE IN THE FUEL TANK, WHICH IN AN INCONVENIENT LOCATION AT BEST. I CAN'T SPARE 500.00 OR 600.00 EVERY YEAR OR SO TO HAVE NEW COMPONENTS INSTALLED IN MY GAS TANK, IF YOU WANT TO BUY AN OLD GM OR CHEVY TRUCK'..YOU'VE BEEN FOREWARNED!   *TR",

LAST FEBRUARY AND AT FRANKS, THE FRONT ROTOR ASSEMBLIES WERE REPLACED AND AN ALIGNMENT DONE.  THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY FOR ABOUT ONE WEEK.  THE TOOK THE TRUCK BACK FOR ANOTHER TRY AND IT SEEMED GOOD FOR ANOTHER WEEK OR SO AND THEN THE PROBLEM WAS BACK.  THEY KEEP THE TRUCK FOR -5- DAYS AND DID VARIOUS THING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IE: ANOTHER ALIGHNMENT, BALANCE THE TIRES, ADJUST THE BRAKES.  ALL ATTEMPTS WERE OBVIOUS BUT THE PROBLEM WAS BACK WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO.  AT THIS POINT AND DATE, THE TRUCK IS CONSTANTLY PULLING SLIGHTLY TO THE FRONT-RIGHT WHENEVER I BRAKE.
