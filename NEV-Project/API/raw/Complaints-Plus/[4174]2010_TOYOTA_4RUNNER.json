HOWEVER, THE FRAME STARTED HAVING SIGNIFICANT RUST AFTER JUST A FEW YEARS AND WAS CAUSING SOME EXPENSIVE REPAIRS. FIRE SHIELD RUSTED OFF AND WAS REMOVED. NOW THE MASSIVE SKID PLATE BRACKET RUSTED OFF. TOYOTA SERVICE JUST REMOVED THE ENTIRE UNREPAIRABLE SKID PLATE DUE TO THE LEVEL OF RUST. THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO ATTACH TO. THE MECHANICS SAID THEY WERE AFRAID TO SCRAPE OR CHIP ANY MORE RUST BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT OTHER STUFF WOULD FALL OFF AND MAKE THE VEHICLE EVEN MORE UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THEY INDICATED THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCESSIVE RUST ON THE FRAME THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THEIR OFFICIAL TOYOTA REPAIR ESTIMATE TO FIX THE RUSTING, FAILING FRAME AND MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN IS $17,783.71 WHICH IS HALF THE VALUE OF A BRAND NEW VEHICLE! TOYOTA CORPORATE SAID, SORRY, WE HAVE RECALLED MANY OTHER RUSTING FRAMES ON OUR OTHER MODELS BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE RUSTED THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, WE WILL NOT STAND BEHIND YOUR 4RUNNER THAT YOU PAID $34,500 FOR. I AM TOLD THAT IT IS THE SAME FRAME AS SOME OF THE OTHER RECALLED MODELS. THE TOYOTA CORPORATION TRIED TO COMFORT ME BY ENSURING ME THAT THEY LOGGED MY CASE WILL CONTACT ME VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL IF THEY EVER DO DECIDE TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND MAKE GOOD ON MY $17,000 PILE OF UNSAFE, USELESS RUST.",

IT SEEMS, AFTER READING COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET CONCERNING THIS ISSUE, THAT TOYOTA FEELS THIS IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. IT SHOULD CONCERN THEM THAT THEY MADE 4RUNNERS THAT, WHILE STILL LOOKING GREAT AFTER MANY YEARS ON THE ROAD, ARE SUBJECT TO UNEXPECTED CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.

UPON DEPRESSING THE BRAKES, THE PEDAL TRAVELS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE SOUNDS SQUEAKY AND NOTCHY AND DELAYS IN STOPPING.  THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES DO NOT INTERACT QUICKLY AND OFTEN TIMES ENGAGED AT THE VERY END OF THE BRAKE DISTANCE AND CREATES A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNSETTLING FEELING.  THE HEIGHT CLEARANCE IS ALSO A CONCERN BECAUSE WHEN CROSS WINDS HIT THE VEHICLE IT CREATES A VERY UNSETTLING FEELING AND CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO SWAY AND GET UNDER THE VEHICLE MAKING PRONE TO LOSS CONTROL.  THAT WIND DOES NOT HAVE TO BE EXCESSIVE; THE MILDEST OF WINDS WILL CAUSE A DISRUPTION.  SEVERAL MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO HAVE A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP REVIEW AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THEY HAVE COME BACK AND STATED THAT IT OPERATES ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.  NO ONE OTHER THAN TOYOTA KNOWS OF THOSE SPECIFICATIONS AND THEY WILL NOT DISCLOSE THEM UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE BY COMPLAINING.  TO ADD FURTHER INSULT TO INJURY, TOYOTA HAS PLACED AN ADMINISTRATIVE HOLD ON ANY REPAIRS UNLESS THEY SANCTION IT.  IN ONE OF THE LATEST USES, I HAD A DEER CROSS MY PATH AND I TRIED TO STOP AND THE VEHICLE KEPT MOVING ALONG AND THE BRAKES GRABBED AFTER 12 FEET.  I MISSED THE DEER BUT I WAS FORCED TO RELIVE THE ISSUE OF HOW FAULTY THE BRAKES ARE FOR THIS VEHICLE.  IT REINFORCED THE ISSUES WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  WE NEED FOR TOYOTA TO OWN UP TO THIS HIDDEN DEFECT.  THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN THESE VEHICLES SEEM TO CONTROL EVERY OPERATING ASPECT OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT APPEARS AT ISSUE AS WELL. *TR  UPDATED IVOQ 01/20/11  THE CONSUMER WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE TO HIS COMPLAINT UPDATED IVOQ 03/01/11",
