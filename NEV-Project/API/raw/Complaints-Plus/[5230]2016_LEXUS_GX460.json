LEXUS INFORMED ME THAT THE VEHICLE HAD AN AIR BAG RECALL IF NOT FIXED ACCORDING TO LITERATURE COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH.  I WAS OPEN TO GET THE VEHICLE FIXED AND STATED I HAD A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WITHIN 2 MILES OF MY HOME.    LEXUS SAID BECAUSE THIS WAS AS SAFETY ISSUE MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WAS UNACCEPTABLE PLACE FOR REPAIRS AND I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SHIPPED TO A DEALERSHIP WHICH WAS THE CLOSEST TO MY AREA 318 MILES AWAY (ONE WAY).  LEXUS OFFERED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE PICKED UP AND CURRIED TO THE DEALERSHIP AT NO COST TO ME.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS VEHICLE IS MY MAIN MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION TO WORK.  WHEN I EXPLAINED THIS TO LEXUS ASSOCIATE IT LEXUS REPLIED THAT I COULD RENT A CAR AND LEXUS WOULD RE-EMBERSE ME FOR THE COST.  WHICH IS GREAT IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO LEASE A CAR UPFRONT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.    WHEN I QUESTIONED WHY A VEHICLE WITH AN AIR BAG SAFETY RECALL ISSUED BACK IN MAY OF 2016 WAS ALLOWED TO BE RE-SOLD WITHOUT BEING FIXED THE ANSWER I RECEIVED WAS THAT IT SHOULD HAVE SHOWN UP ON THE CARFAX.  I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WITH A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH.  I BELIEVE NOT ONLY DOES LEXUS HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY BUT SO DOES THE DEALERSHIP IN WHICH I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM AS I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE RECALL AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.    WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID I FEEL I HAVE NO PROBLEM HAVING THE VEHICLE FIXED WITHIN REASONABLE COMPROMISE BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES.  BUT IF IN THE INTERIM TIME SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED AS A RESULT OF THIS RECALL I WANT IT DOCUMENTED THAT I MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO REPORT IT TO THE NHTSA PRIOR TO ANY SUCH INCIDENTS.",
