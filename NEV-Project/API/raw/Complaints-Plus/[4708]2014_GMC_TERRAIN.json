Upon arriving home I researched the issue, and found similar complaints regarding the same issue of 2014 Terrains either stalling while driving, or having complete engine failure while traveling highway speeds.  Upon further research I also found numerous complaints regarding unusual oil consumption.  In 5 days I added 5 qts of oil, and took it to a repair shop February 10, 2022 where they added 4 quarts of oil and diagnosed a rear main seal (again no check engine light, or oil pressurewarning light).  Bottom of my car is currently covered in oil from the massive leak.  I purchased the vehicle used, and have changed the oil on the recommended schedule with 5-30 synthetic blend oil.",

        "summary": "Around 76k miles the vehicle started to stall, the engine completely stopped while in drive. The vehicle was burning oil and had terrible gas milage prior to stalling incidents. The first time it stalled was at an intersection with a traffic light, when we went to slow down the engine completely shut down. My infant daughter was in the car with me and it was terrifying. We would have been hit had the light not been turning red. After that we recognized that it typically stalled after starting the car and attempting to accelerate. At times it happened when pulling out of a parking lot onto a busy street and I would loose engine power. This was extremely scary due to not being able to get out of the way of oncoming traffic. I had to put my flashers on and roll to the side of the road where I could restart the car. The engine ran really loud and rough when the issue first started and even after repairs the engine is still loud when first starting from cold. After time the issue persisted and I noticed that after the first start and stall if I revved the engined hard it did not stall a second or third time. Prior to that there were times the vehicle stalled 2-3 times after first start. The first time I took it to a garage (79k) there was a check engine light on and they diagnosed a sensor that needed to be changed. The problem persisted after the sensor was changed.  I contacted another local garage who said there are known engine issues with this make and model and they wouldn't touch it and suggested taking it to the dealer. The dealer said they are familiar with this issue and the engine needed to be rebuilt for $4500. This was quite a shock given the car only had 88k miles on it at the time we contacted the dealer. After the dealer repairs the engine no longer stalls. Recalls on this model only go through 2013. The date on my radio resets to October 13, 2013 when the battery is disconnected so it seems this issue is persisting in models not included in the lawsuit.",
