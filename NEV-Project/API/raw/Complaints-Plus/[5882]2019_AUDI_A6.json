THIS LEAVES YOU STRANDED, AND RISKS CAUSING SOMEONE TO REAR-END YOUR VEHICLE IF THE LIGHT CHANGES.  PUTTING THE CAR IN PARK, TURNING OFF THE IGNITION, AND THEN TURNING THE IGNITION BACK ON RESUMES ENGINE FUNCTION.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES.

ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WITH LESS THAN ONE INCH OF SNOW ON THE GROUND, I TOTALLY LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR WHILE BRAKING.  MY WIFE REFUSED TO RIDE AGAIN WITH ME WITH THE TIRES THAT CAME WITH THE CAR.  I FINALLY WENT BACK IN AND HAD TO PURCHASE FROM THEM FOUR NEW SOTOZERO3 WINTER TIRES AND FOUR NEW WHEELS.  I NOW HAVE 8 NEW TIRES AND 8 NEW WHEELS.  MY COMPLAIN IS WITH AUDI, NOT THE DEALER.  SELLING OR LEASING THESE VEHICLES WITH SUMMER TIRES ONLY IN A GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THAT EXPERIENCES WINTERS SUCH AS SUBURBAN CHICAGO, IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.
