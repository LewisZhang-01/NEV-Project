WE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT THE CAR WAS NOT MOVING AT THE TIME - BUT THIS COULD HAPPEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS A LARGE SAFETY ISSUE IN MY OPINION.  I THINK ALL LANDCRUISERS SHOULD BE RECALLED TO HAVE THEIR SEAT BELTS CHECKED AND THAT THIS CHECK SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF REGULAR MAINTENANCE ITEMS BY THE MANUFACTURER.
