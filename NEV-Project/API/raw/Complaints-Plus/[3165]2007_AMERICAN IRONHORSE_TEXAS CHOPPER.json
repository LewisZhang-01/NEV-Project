AFTER TAKING THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP FOR ITS 500 MILE CHECK UP, THE VEHICLE WAS STILL OPERABLE.  APPROXIMATELY 2,000 MILES LATER, THE COMPENSATOR NUT LOOSENED AND CAUSED THE ENTIRE CHARGING SYSTEM AND SPROCKET SYSTEM TO FAIL.  THE MOTORCYCLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER AND THEY STATED THAT THE MOTORCYCLE WAS ASSEMBLED IMPROPERLY BY THE MANUFACTURER AND MADE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.  THE DEALER FROM WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED STATED THAT ALL OF THE FAILING COMPONENTS WOULD BE REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY; HOWEVER, THEY LATER STATED THAT BECAUSE THE CONTACT RESIDED IN TWO DIFFERENT STATES, THE REPAIRS WOULD NOT BE MADE.  THE MOTORCYCLE WAS REPAIRED BY A LOCAL MECHANIC.  AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE MADE, THE COMPRESSION RELEASE VALVE FAILED.  THE MECHANIC COULD NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE FAILURE.  THE MOTORCYCLE HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED AGAIN SINCE.  THE CONTACT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REACH THE MANUFACTURER BECAUSE THEY ENTERED INTO A CHAPTER 11.  THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 10,000 AND FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,500.",
