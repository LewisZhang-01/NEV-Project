        "summary": "Since new 14,500 miles ago when hitting road bumps or at speeds between 73-76 MPH the ABS & Traction Control lights come on. This causes lose of Anti-Lock Braking, Cruise Control, Hill Start Protection, & Stability Control. It has been back to Ford 5 times & not fixed. It was last to Rush Truck Center who replaced a damaged Tone Ring & Wheel Speed Sensor. Mine was the third one repaired in 2 weeks & all on the right rear. I just completed a 5,300 mile road trip & every day had these lights come on multiple times which required stopping shutting off the engine to reset the computer. Ford has had our unit in the shop now 100 days, first time for 58 straight days.",
