Leaving me in the middle of the road. Thankfully I was on a low traffic road, so there was no accident.  It was a scary situation to be at.   After that, I managed to start the car after couple of tries and pull it over to a safer place. The car was useless so  I had to call my BMW dealer.   To add to the bad experience the dealer took long to service my car. They are unable to find the problem and it is charging me extra $1,170 for another 8 hours of labor without any guarantees.   My BMW is on excellent condition with 40k miles only. The car never alert me of any signs or warnings. This is a major failure that should not happen to any car owner in these days.",

My son and I could have been killed.  The car went into Park and had to be towed on a flatbed to the dealer.  After 5 days of no word, the dealer falsely accused me of putting gasoline in my diesel vehicle. The dealer eventually determined that the high-pressure fuel pump had failed, which caused exactly the problem listed in BMW's July 29, 2021 recall notice to its dealers:  it caused metal fragments to contaminate the entire fuel system.  BMW initially advised me that it  had no \"recall remedy,\"  but when it did, it would replace the fuel pump but would not repair the nearly $13,000 in damage to the fuel system that the fuel pump failure caused.  BMW eventually relented and advised it will complete all repairs caused by the fuel pump failure.  But it has declined to reimburse me for the \"overage\" charges I've incurred in towing the vehicle to the dealer and in connection with the rental vehicle they obtained for me.    And of course, not a single apology for the harrowing experience that could have resulted in our deaths, nor for the considerable inconvenience caused by this defect that BMW has known about for years.",

ARE WE BEING SHOT AT?\" I TOLD MYSELF TO STAY CALM AND FOCUS ON GETTING OURSELVES TO SAFETY. I FOUND THE NEXT EXIT AND PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911 AND THEY SENT TWO OFFICERS IN TWO DIFFERENT PATROL CARS. MY DAUGHTER AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR- PIECES OF GLASS IN OUR HAIR AND EVEN DOWN THE BACK OF OUR PANTS AGAINST OUR SKIN.

WE DID NOT TOUCH ANYTHING AND WANTED TO HIGHWAY PATROL TO SEE THE CAR EXACTLY AS IT LOOKED. WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY LOOKED AROUND THE WHOLE EXTERIOR OF THE CAR AND THEN LOOKED INSIDE.
