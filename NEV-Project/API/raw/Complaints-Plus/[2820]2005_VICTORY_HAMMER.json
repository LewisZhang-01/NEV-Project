THE MOTORCYCLE WAS TOWED TO A VICTORY DEALER IN HARRISONBURG, VA AND 2 WEEKS LATER I WAS INFORMED THAT ONE OF THE SHIFT FORK BROKE AND FELL INTO THE TRANSMISSION AND GROUND UP 2 GEARS.  ALSO INFORMED THAT THE CLUTCH WAS BURNED.  ALTHOUGH THIS MOTORCYCLE IS 10 YEARS OLD, IT ONLY HAD 5330 MILES ON IT AND WAS REGULARLY SERVICED.  FROM MY UNDERSTANDING SHIFT FORKS DO NOT JUST BREAK.  I BELIEVE EITHER THE PART WAS DEFECTIVE OR THE DESIGN WAS DEFECTIVE.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION AS THE MOTORCYCLE WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP AND THROWN ME OFF IF THE BREAK HAD OCCURRED WHILE I WAS MOVING AT REGULAR HIGHWAY SPEED.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS DANGEROUS PART AND CONDITION.  THANK YOU. UPDATE 9/15/15*CW      UPDATED 12/12/2017*CN",
