THE FIX IS TO DRILL OUT THE REMAINING PIECE OF BOLT (THREADED PART) AND THEN USE A BOLT EXTRACTOR TO REMOVE THE REMAINING PIECE OF BOLT THAT IS STILL SEIZED IN THE HEAD. WELL, THE MOST COMMON BOLT TO BREAK OFF OUT OF THE 12 MANIFOLD BOLTS IS THE ONE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVERS POSITION. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS THE HARDEST BOLT TO REMOVE BECAUSE OF IT'S LOCATION.  MOST SHOPS I'VE BEEN TO SAY THAT THE TICKING SOUND THAT YOU HEAR ONCE THIS BOLT BREAKS OFF IS A LOOSE LIFTER.  THAT IS INCORRECT!  THE TICKING SOUND IS ACTUALLY AN EXHAUST LEAK STEMMING FROM, MOST LIKELY, THE BROKEN BOLT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER.  THE SOUND GOES AWAY ONCE THE ENGINE WARMS UP BECAUSE OF THE METAL EXPANDING WITH THE TEMPERATURE INCREASE.  I HAD 3 MECHANICS UNDER THE HOOD OF MY TRUCK FOR ALMOST 9 HOURS TRYING TO REMOVE THE 6 BOLTS THAT HAD BROKEN ON MY ENGINE.  THEY HAD BROKEN EVERY DRILL BIT IN THEIR SHOP (THE SHOP IS A 14 LIFT, 16 BAY SHOP) THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE USED TO DRILL A HOLE FOR THE EXTRACTOR JUST TRYING TO GET A HOLE FOR THE EXTRACTOR TO FIT IN AND THEN THE BOLT EXTRACTOR BROKE OFF IN THE LAST BOLT WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE ONE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER.  THEY HAD THE CROSS MEMBER REMOVED AND WERE PREPARING TO DROP MY ENGINE WHEN I TOLD THEM TO JUST STOP THERE.  I COULDN'T AFFORD ANY MORE OF A FIX SINCE I WAS $1,800 DEEP INTO THIS ONE DAY AT THE SHOP AS IT WAS. THIS IS SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM THAT THERE ARE AFTERMARKET CONTRAPTIONS TO BOLT ON AND CINCH THE MANIFOLD DOWN WITH ANOTHER BOLT. THAT ISN'T THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE CROSS MEMBERS SUPPORT THE FUEL TANK AND IF ONE WOULD BREAK, IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD CASSETTE FUEL TANK TO FALL OFF.  THE TRUCK HAS 100,500 MILES ON IT, WHICH IS NOT EXCESSIVE FOR THE YEAR.  THE TRUCK SPENT MOST OF ITS LIFE IN MICHIGAN, BUT NOW RESIDES IN ILLINOIS.  I HAVE READ SEVERAL FORUMS HAVING THE SAME COMPLAINTS FOR THE 99-2007 MODEL YEAR VEHICLES.  THERE ARE SEVERAL HOLES PLACED ON THESE CROSS MEMBERS BY THE MANUFACTURER THAT ALLOW MOISTURE IN, WITH NO PLACE FOR THE MOISTURE TO GO ONCE IT IS PLACE.  I AM SURE THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF PROPER PAINT APPLICATION  AND EVEN POOR STEEL THAT IS LIKELY CAUSING THE ISSUE.  JUST AS TOYOTA HAS DONE, CHEVY SHOULD OFFER A RECALL FOR EXCESSIVE RUST ON THE FRAME.  THE TOYOTA TUNDRA RECALL OFFERS A NEW FRAME FOR ANY TUNDRA WITH A RUST HOLE 10MM OR LARGER.  WHY ISN'T THE NHTSA INVESTIGATING THIS FURTHER?  THIS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND ALSO CONSIDERABLY LOWERS THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE.  GM AND CHEVY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DECISIONS WHEN DESIGNING AND MANUFACTURING THESE VEHICLES, JUST AS TOYOTA TOOK ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR DECISIONS.",

I WAS HOLDING THE BRAKES AS SOON AS I REALIZED THE TRUCK WAS OUT OF CONTROL. IF NOT FOR THE GUARD RAIL, MY FAMILY AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPELLED OVER A STEEP EMBANKMENT WITH FATAL RESULTS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD THIS OCCUR ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE I PURCHASED IT IN 2001. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.   *TR",

THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AFTER THE INCIDENT, NOT BEFORE.  CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR, FLUID LEVEL WAS BELOW MINIMUM.  UNDER THE VEHICLE, THE PROBLEM WAS APPARENT.  NEAR THE ABS CONTROL UNIT IT LOOKED LIKE THE METAL LINE(S) HAD EXPLODED AND BRAKE FLUID WAS ALL OVER THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK AND DRIPPING DOWN THE FRAME RAIL.  CHECKING THE VEHICLE, I FOUND ALL THE METAL BRAKE LINES, ESPECIALLY NEAR THE ABS UNIT, WERE BADLY RUSTED.    TWO PROBLEMS:  1.  THE FAILURE WAS CATASTROPHIC WITHOUT WARNING.  WHILE THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AFTER THE BRAKE LINE FAILURE, IT PROVIDED NO PRIOR INDICATION OF PROBLEMS.  BRAKE FLUID WAS OK PRIOR TO THE LINE FAILURE (NO BRAKE SERVICE LIGHT) AND THE BRAKE FLUID LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF THE BRAKE LINE RUPTURE.  THE BRAKE LINE, WEAKENED BY RUST, FAILED WITH THE INCREASED PRESSURE WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  2.  THERE WAS NO RESIDUAL OR BACK-UP BRAKING AVAILABLE EVEN WITH FULLY DEPRESSED BRAKE PEDAL.      I'VE READ GM'S STATEMENT THAT THE BRAKE SERVICE LIGHT WOULD PROVIDE ADVANCE WARNING AND THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BRAKING (WITH LONGER STOPPING DISTANCES) SHOULD THERE BE FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM.  UNFORTUNATELY, IN CATASTROPHIC BRAKE LINE FAILURES THERE WERE NO WARNINGS; THE WARNING LIGHT WAS DELAYED AFTER THE FACT.    FROM AN ENGINEER'S PERSPECTIVE, DID THE METALLURGICAL CONTENT OF THE BRAKE LINES CHANGE IN 1999 OR PERHAPS THAT WAS WHEN THE ABS HOUSING CHANGED TO ALUMINUM?  THE GALVANIC NATURE OF THE STEEL BRAKE LINES CONNECTING TO ALUMINUM IN THE PRESENCE OF SALT WATER WILL CERTAINLY RESULT IN THE INCREASED CORROSION OF THE BRAKE LINES.    SUMMARY:  THE NHTSA NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL (REGARDLESS WHETHER GM IS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MONETARY COSTS OF REPAIR) TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS.      *TR",

SOME AREAS OF THE LINE WHEN I TOUCHED IT JUST FELL APART IN MY HANDS. I HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT JUST ABOUT EVERYONE I KNOW WHO OWNS 1999-2003 CHEVY TRUCKS ARE HAVING BRAKE LINE FAILING DUE TO CHEAP STEEL RUSTED LINES. WHILE I WAS UNDER THE TRUCK I ALSO NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE CROSS MEMBERS THAT SUPPORT THE RIGHT REAR SHOCK PLUS THE GAS TANK IS SUPPORTED OFF OF IS RUSTED WITH ONLY HALF A TUBE LEFT. PLUS JUST ABOUT ALL OF MY GAS LINES HAVE SERIOUS RUST ON THEM. MY OTHER ISSUE IS THAT THE ROCKER PANELS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAB ARE RUSTED THREW TO A POINT THAT YOU CAN STICK YOUR HAND IN THEM.

ON 11/13/2010, THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT LINE RUSTED THROUGH WHEN MY CHILDREN AND I WERE IN THE TRUCK.  IN A RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT LOW, BUT THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO STILL HAVE BRAKING POWER.  I DROVE ABOUT 3/4 OF A MILE TO A GAS STATION AND HAD ALMOST NO BRAKING POWER WHEN I GOT THERE.  I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK AND BRAKE FLUID WAS SPRAYING OUT!  MY TRUCK WAS TOWED HOME AND THE NEXT DAY I SPLICED IN A REPLACEMENT BRAKE LINE, BUT NOTICED THAT THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE VERY RUSTY.  IN AUGUST OF 2012 ANOTHER BRAKE LINE RUSTED THROUGH, THIS TIME WHILE THE TRUCK WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY.  I HAD STARTED THE TRUCK TO LEAVE, AND PUSHED ON THE BRAKE TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK AND THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR.  I EXITED THE VEHICLE AND SAW BRAKE FLUID SPRAYING UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK.  AT THIS POINT, I DECIDED TO REPLACE ALL OF THE FAULTY FACTORY BRAKE LINES WITH AFTER-MARKET STAINLESS STEEL BRAKE LINES.  I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS JOB, AS IT IS VERY MAINTENANCE INTENSIVE JOB, AND I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WORK ON THE VEHICLE, BUT LUCKILY I HAVE OTHER VEHICLES TO DRIVE.

I WAS CHECKING YOUR WEBSITE 3 DAYS AGO WHEN I CAME ACROSS RECALL #GM05068, NHTSA 05V379000. I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALER TO INQUIRE ABOUT RECALL REPAIRS. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE RECALL HAD BEEN DONE ON MY VEHICLE ON 02-17-06.  THEY SAID THEY ARE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO DO THE RECALL REPAIRS ONCE.  I ASSUME THIS WAS DONE WHEN I HAD THE VEHICLE IN FOR OTHER ISSUES, AS I HAD NO BRAKE PROBLEMS AT THE TIME. SO APPROXIMATELY 2 YRS AFTER THE RECALL SERVICE WAS DONE THE PROBLEM PRESENTED ITSELF. I CALLED GM TODAY (REF # 71-106-286-2771) THEY SAID THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON THE RECALL BUT IT IS \"POSSIBLE\" THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME ASSISTANCE UNDER ANOTHER PROGRAM IF I TAKE IT TO THE DEALER AND PAY FOR A DIAGNOSIS \"OF A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT\". I WAS ALREADY TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THE FIX WOULD COST BETWEEN $200-350.00, AND DIAGNOSIS IS LIKELY TO ADD ANOTHER 100.00, WITH NO ASSURANCE OF ANY REIMBURSEMENT.  MY PROBLEM IS THREE FOLD: THE ORIGINAL FIX DID NOT ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM, THE PROBLEM IS A DESIGN WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS SAFETY AND APPEARS TO RE-OCCUR RANDOMLY EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS, A REAL FIX MUST HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED SINCE TRUCKS AFTER 2002 ARE NOT SIMILARLY AFFECTED. FOR MY WIFE'S SAFETY I HAVE CHOSEN TO PULL THE FUSE AND DISABLE THE ABS SYSTEM, RETURNING THE VEHICLE TO PRE-ABS STATUS, AND THE BRAKES WORK FINE.

THE FACT THAT BOTH THE FRONT AND REAR LINES AND ROUTED TOGETHER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VEHICLE ELIMINATES THE SAFETY BENEFITS OF THE DUAL MASTER CYLINDER / FRONT AND REAR SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY FACTOR ON OLDER VEHICLES. IN MY CASE THE FRONT AND REAR LINES FAILED AT THE SAME POINT AND AT THE SAME TIME.     ADDITIONALLY ON INSPECTING MY TRUCK THE HARDWARE THAT HOLDS THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PADS IN PLACE HAD ALSO RUSTED AWAY AND CAUSED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE LINING TO SET ASKEW IN THE ROTOR CAUSING IT TO GET WORN DOWN.  IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO OPERATE AS WELL.    ALL IN ALL A REALLY POOR DESIGNED SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED BEFORE LIVES ARE LOST.   *TR",

THE TRUCK IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF, REGULARLY SERVICED, AND HAD JUST ABOVE 80,00 MILES. THE DEALER TOLD ME I WAS LUCKY THE BRAKE LINES DID NOT RUPTURE WHEN I WAS DRIVING.

COULD THE MANUFACTURER BE REQUIRED TO FIX THIS ISSUE AGAIN AT NO COST TO US? IT DOES APPEAR TO US THAT GM FIXED THE ISSUE  THE FIRST TIME BUT NOT THE PROBLEM,THAT CAUSED THE ISSUE.*TR",

I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD THE TRUCK TOWED. THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO SEE HIM AND HE SHOWED HOW BAD  THE CORROSION WAS ON THE BRAKE LINES. EVERY BRAKE LINE ON THE TRUCK (FROM ABOUT SIX INCHES FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER) WAS ROTTED ALMOST COMPLETELY THROUGH!!! NEED LESS TO SAY, I HAVE TO REPLACE EVERY BRAKE LINE ON THE TRUCK, WHICH WILL BE A FORTUNE!!!  DID I MENTION THE FUEL LINES? THEY TOO ARE ALSO ROTTED!! IT SEEMS THAT EVERYWHERE THAT THE STEEL LINES WERE USED, IT IS ROTTED I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO REPLACE THE FUEL LINES ALSO IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

AT THAT TIME THE TRUCK HAD APPRXIMATELY 45K MIILES ON IT. WHEN I CONTACTED CHEVY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, THEY TOLD ME IT IS AN ENVIROMENTAL HAZZARD, DUE TO WHERE I LIVE. I REPLIED THAT I HAD NEW TIRES PUT ON THE TRUCK IN MAY {?} OF THAT YEAR & THE ROTORS WERE FINE BUT WHEN I TOOK TRUCK FOR INSPECTION IN NOV. THEY WERE NOT. I ASKED HOW MUCH SALT THEY THOUGHT PA. USED DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS? I RECIEVED NO REPLY.    NOW HERE WE ARE IN JAN., 2008. MY TRUCK NOW HAS 60 K MILES ON IT & THE ROTORS NEED REPLACED AGAIN?? CONSIDERING THIS TRUCK IS DRIVEN AN AVERAGE OF 7K MILES PER YEAR, WITH 90% OF THAT BEING DURING SUMMER MONTHES, THIS IS NOT AN ENVIROMENTAL PROBLEM! THIS TRUCK IS ONLY DRIVEN DURING WINTER MONTHES IF THERE IS AN EMERGANCY SO IT IS EXTREMELY RARE THIS TRUCK IS DRIVEN ON SALTED ROADS. THIS TRUCK IS ALSO GARAGED AT ALL TIMES, I WAX THE FIREWALLS, ARMOR ALL & CLEAN THE TRUCK WEEKLY. ALSO OUR DRIVEWAY IS ALONG A RURAL ROAD & THE DRIVEWAY IS HIGHER THAN THE ROAD SURFACE.          I HAVE GONE THROUGH YOUR COMPLAINT LIST & I HAVE FOUND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WITH THIS PROBLEM, IN RE:ODI ID #10158646. I HONESTLY BELIEVE THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVE NOT RECIEVED MORE COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE IS DUE TO TOO MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT THE CHEVY REPS. ARE SAYING ABOUT ENVIROMENTAL HAZZARD.I HAVE HAD CHEVY EMPLOYEES TELL ME BRAND NEW CARS, JUST OFF THE DELIVERY TRUCK ARE ALSO HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM & THE DEALERSHIPS ARE REPLACING THE ROTORS BEFORE THE CARS ARE EVEN PUT ON THE LOT!!    SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THE QUALITY OF THESE ROTORS & I REALLY DO WISH YOU WOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT/KILLED.    THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANY/ALL HELP ON THIS MATTER.

WHEN THE ABS ENGAGES IT IS ALWAYS AT LOW SPEEDS (LESS THAN 10MPH) AND DOES SO REGARDLESS OF DRIVING CONDITIONS AND ROAD SURFACE CONDITIONS. THE STOPPING DISTANCE IS DANGEROUSLY INCREASED. I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT YET, BUT COME VERY CLOSE.    I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND LEARNED THAT IT IS VERY COMMON. GM ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN IN THE US,TSB#03-05-25-007A) AND A RECALL IN CANADA FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO DEBRI AND OR RUST ON THE FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSORS. I PLAN TO UNPLUG MY ABS FUSE UNTIL I AM ABLE TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE LISTED IN THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN.    I FIND IT VERY NEGLIGENT OF GM TO NOT NOTIFY OWNERS OF MODELS AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM AND NOT ENCOURAGE THEIR DEALER NETWORK TO NOTIFY OWNERS OF VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM.

I WAITED TILL THERE WAS NO CARS COMING AND PROCEEDED OUT ONTO TILTON ROAD TOWARD PEP BOYS.  DOWN SHIFTED AND APPLIED BRAKE PEDAL AS I APPROACHED STORE.  THEY CHECKED THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND INDICATED THAT A BRAKE LINE WAS LEAKING FLUID.   MONDAY THEY REPAIRED THE TRUCK BY REPLACING ABOUT A FIVE (5) FOOT SECTION OF BRAKE LINE AT THE TUNE OF $262.52 WOW.  I DO HAVE THE OLD SECTION OF BRAKE LINE THAT WAS REMOVED.   THE OLD SECTION OF BRAKE LINE IS SO HEAVILY RUSTED THE SHOP INDICATED IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL.

WHEN I DETERMINED THAT WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE SOUND, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A FRIENDS GARAGE WHERE WE LIFTED THE REAR AND REMOVED THE REAR-END HOUSING COVER. UPON INSPECTION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WE NOTICED THAT THE RETENTION BOLT HAD BROKEN AND THE CROSS PIN FELL OUT. THIS IN TURN CAUSED THE SPIDER GEARS TO \"EXPLODE.\" I PURCHASED AND INSTALLED A NEW DIFFERENTIAL, $500.00. I STILL HAVE A \"TICKING\" NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR. I BELIEVE THAT IS DUE TO A MISSING TOOTH ON THE PINION GEAR CAUSED BY THE CROSS PIN. NOW I HAVE TO ORDER A NEW RING AND PINION GEAR SET, $300. 74,000 MILES. 14,000 OVER WARRANTY.

SO FAR THIS RECALL HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND ACTION TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. I AM CONVINCED FROM MY EXPERIENCE, THAT THIS SITUATION WILL CAUSE OR HAS CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS/INCIDENTS IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.  *NM UPDATED 07/19/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

THE SERVICE MANAGER EXCLAIMED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SO MUCH RUST ON BRAKE SYSTEMS.  AS A RETIRED PROFESSOR, HAVING TAUGHT METALLURGY AND INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS, THERE ARE METAL TREATMENT PROCEDURES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED WHEN MANUFACTURING PIPING FOR VEHICLE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS.  OBVIOUSLY, GENERAL MOTORS USED INFERIOR PARTS AND MATERIALS IN BRAKE SYSTEMS.  IF THEY DO NOT RECALL ALL VEHICLES WITH BRAKE COMPONENT RUSTING PROBLEMS, MANY ACCIDENTS WILL OCCUR.  THE VEHICLE I AM REPORTING IS CURRENTLY UNDER REPAIR AND THE COST ESTIMATES BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT TOM GILL CHEVROLET IN FLORENCE, KENTUCKY ARE QUOTED AT $1500.00, OR MORE.

I CALLED UNIROYAL AND SHE SAID IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM IF OUR TIRES CRACKED, THAT'S WHAT TIRES DO. THESE TIRES THAT CRACKED, PEELED, AND SHREDDED  HAVE A 75,000 MILES WARRANTY, NOONE WILL HONOR THIS WARRANTY AND WE HAD TO SPEND OVER $400 BUYING NEW TIRES.   *NM",

IN SEPTEMBER, 2004 I NOTICED THAT THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM WOULD ACTIVATE AS I SLOWED (< 10 MPH) TO A STOP.  THIS ISSUE BEGAN INTERMITTANTLY BUT WORSENED AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. BY JAN, 2005, THE ABS WOULD ACTIVATE EVERY TIME I APPLIED THE BRAKES AT SLOW SPEEDS (< 10 MPH).  NO TROUBLE LIGHTS CAME ON. I DID NOT HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WITH THIS ISSUE BUT HAD ONE VERY CLOSE CALL IN A PARKING LOT.  THIS INCIDENT CAUSED M TO INVESTIGATE AND FIX THE PROBLEM.    IN LATE JANUARY, I HAD A GM DEALER INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE AND THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE LEFT FRONT HUB ASSEMBLY.  GIVEN THE HIGH PRICE THE DEALER WAS GOING TO CHARGE FOR THE REPLACEMENT PART AND THE LABOR, I ELECTED TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT FRONT HUB ASSEMBLY FROM A LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE (AUTOZONE).  I REPLACED THE LEFT FRONT HUB ASSEMBLY PER THE VEHICLE'S SERVICE MANUAL DIRECTIONS. AND THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY.    THE HUB I REMOVED WAS HEAVILY CORRODED WITH SIGNS THAT THE SEAL ON THE INBOARD SIDE OF THE HUB WAS CORRODED WITH A PORTION OF THE EXCLUDER LIPS MISSING.    I STILL HAVE THE HUB ASSEMBLY THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND WOULD BE GLAD TO PROVIDE IT FOR TEARDOWN INSPECTION.  IN ADDITION, I AM A DEGREED MECHANICAL ENGINEER THAT WORKS FOR A LEADING AXLE AND DRIVESHAFT MANUFACTURER AND WOULD BE GLAD TO DISCUSS THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FURTHER.  I BELIEVE THAT SEAL FAILED AND THIS ALLOWED DEBRIS / CORROSION TO ENTER THE HUB ASSEMBLY WHICH THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED A SIGNAL INTERUPTION BETWEEN THE TONE WHEE AND SPEED SENSOR.  THUS, THE ABS SYSTEM BELIEVED THAT THE LEFT FRONT HUB WAS NOT ROTATING AND CAUSED THE ABS SYSTEM TO ACTIVATE.    MY ISSUE IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE ISSUE DESCRIBED IN THE MAY 27, 2005 ISSUE OF THE DETROIT FREE PESS TITLED \"GM TRUCK OWNERS INSIST BRAKES ARE A PROBLEM\".",

THEY WOULD ALSO LOCK UP AND THE TRUCK WOULD KEEP MOVING WITH MY FOOT ON OR OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT WAS TO EASE OFF THE PETALL AND HIT THE PEDAL HARD AND AT TIMES THIS WOULD KNOT WORK ON THE FIRST TRY. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO MY LOCAL GOODYEAR SERVICE STATION AND HAD THEM CHECK IT OUT. THEY DID NOT SEE A PROBLEM WITH THE ABS SYTEM BUT THEY SAID THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE ROTORS BECUSE THEY WERE RUSTED VERY BAD . I DID THAT AND A IT DID NOT FIX THE PROPLEM. SO I CONTACTED MY LOCAL GM DELAERSHIP AND ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD LOOK AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RECALLS OR PROBLEMS WITH THE ABS SYTEM THAT I WAS NOT INFORMED OFF THEY SAID NO THERE WAS NOT. WHILE ON VACTION VISTING MY PARENTS IN ANOTHER STATE I WENT TO A GM DEALERSHIP AND HAD THEM TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND AFTER HOOKING IT UP TO THE COMPUTER THEY SAID IT COULD BE THE SPEED SENSOR OR THE ABS MODULE. SO I HAD THEM REPLACE THE SPEED SENSOR  AND THEY ALSO DID SOME OTHERE REPAIRS ON THE TRUCK AS WELL BUT AT THIS TIME I CAN NOT TELL YOU WHAT THEY DONE BECUSE I DO NOT HAVE ACCSESS TO THE BILL. AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE FRONT PADS IN ABOUT 3 TO 4 MONTHS. EVERYTHING WAS GOING FINE THEN IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN AND IT HAD BEEN 3 TO 4 MONTHS SINCE I HAD THE SPEED SENSOR CHANGED SO I TOOK THE TRUCK TO PEP BOYS . AT PEP BOYS I HAD THEM CHECK THE FRONT TO REPLACE THE BRAKE PADS AND THEY DID SO. THIS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. NOW I WOULD TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT AGAIN AND REPLACE THE ABS MODUEL BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW I HAVE INVESTED OVER $900 IN THIS PROBLEM.

I FINALLY GOT DISGUSTED WHEN IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN THIS WINTER AND PULLED THE FUSE FOR THE ABS SYSTEM.

I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR LOW SPEED ACCIDENTS AT INTERSECTIONS WITH THIS DEFECT.  WHEN THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGES, THE VEHICLE DOES NOT BRAKE EFFECTIVELY AT ALL.

THEN AT THAT SPEED THE BRAKES WOULD GRAB VERY HARD.  IT WAS REALLY ANNYOING AND DANGEROUS.  FOR SOME TIME I NEARLY HIT SOME CARS AHEAD OF ME.  ON FEBRUARY 2004 I HAD THE FRONT HUBS, ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS REPLACED AT A COST OF $746.60 INCLUDING LABOR AT AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP.  THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED OVER A YEAR AGO.  THE MILEAGE ON THE TRUCK WAS 85,000, BUT THE TRUCK WAS BARELY 3 YEARS OLD.    FYI, GM MADE A PROFIT OF ABOUT $8,000 WHEN I BOUGHT THE TRUCK, ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY PUBLICATIONS.  MULTIPLY THAT BY 1,200,000 AND YOU HAVE A FILTHY PROFITEERING COMPANY ON YOUR HANDS.  I WANT MY MONEY REIMBURSED.   I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A SAFETY PROBLEM IN MY LIFE BEFORE.

I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE HOME IN THIS CONDITION.   I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A RECALL FOR CERTAIN TRUCKS THAT CONTAIN SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL EQUIPMENT.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS INFORMED THAT MY TRUCK'S VIN IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL.  FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION WITH A GM REPRESENTATIVE, I CONDUCTED FURTHER RESEARCH.  FROM WHAT I CAN ASCERTAIN, THE TRUCKS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL HAVE THE SAME HYDRO-BOOST SYSTEM THAT MY TRUCK HAS.  I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY GM IS EXCLUDING A TRUCK FROM ITS RECALL THAT HAS THE SAME EQUIPMENT AND SAME CRIPPLING MALFUNCTION OF TRUCKS THAT HAVE BEEN RECALLED.

AS FEW AS 3 TIMES A WEEK  AS MUCH AS 10 TIMES A WEEK. ONE TIME I WAS STOPPING AT A SIDE ROAD WAITING TO ENTER A HIGWAY AND THE TRUCK STOPPED THEN THRUST FORWARD INTO THE TRAFFIC. FORTUNATELY I DID NOT GET HIT BUT CAME  CLOSE TO A ACCIDENT. THE WAY TO STOP IT IS BY THROWING IT INTO PARK. YESTERDAY I STOPPED IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMERS GARAGE AND WENT THROUGH THE GARAGE DOOR AS THE TRUCK  THRUST FORWARD. I CONTACTED THE CHEVY DEALER AND  HAD THE MASTER CYLINDER REPLACED. NO GOOD.  THEN WAS TOLD IT WAS THE POWER BOOSTER. NOT THAT. .TODAY THEY SAY IT IS THE SENSOR IN ONE OF THE WHEELS. WILL REPLACE TOMORROW.I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WILL STOP IT FROM THRUSTING FORWARD. I HAVE SPEND MUCH MONEY SENSOR ALONE COSTING 600.00 AND THE GARAGE DOOR 760.00  MY BIGGEST WORRY IS  FEAR OF THRUSTING FORWARD WHEN AT A CROSS ROAD.  THE CAR DEALERS AND GENERAL MOTORS HOT LINE SAID THEIR IS NO PRIOR REPORT . I HOPE ITS THE SENSORBECAUSE EVERYTIME THIS HAPPENS YOU  PANIC . IT IS VERY COSTLY AND COULD COST ME MY LIFE. I ALSO THINK THAT MORE CONCERN FROM THE MANUFACTURER COULD BE TAKEN . I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THIS SENSOR DOES NOT WORK AS THEY SAY THIS IS THE ONLY CODE THAT CAME UP WHEN PUT ON A MACHINE. THEY PUT IT ON THE MACHINE BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE ABS LIGHT COMES ON AND I HAD TO GET IT TO THE DEALER WHEN IT WAS ON AS THEY COULD NOT CHECK IT UNLESS IT WAS ON. THIS WAS DIFFICULT AS THE DEALER IS 30 MINUTES AWAY.  IF YOU HAVE EVERY HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE I HAVE TO SPEND MORE UNNECESSARY MONIES OR BEFORE I GET HURT.

THE OTHER BRAND THAT I SEE ALOT OF WITH COMPLETE TREAD SEPERATION AND THE TIRE IS STILL HOLDING AIR IS THE FIRESTONE STEELTEX 245/75R16. I AM NOTE SURE HOW ALL THE POLITICS WORK BETWEEN THE TIRE MAN. AND THE AUTO MAN. BUT IT SURE SEEMS THAT ALOT OF THIS MUST BE GOING UNCHECKED BY THE AGENCIES THAT ARE REGULATING DEFECTS. I WRITE AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN.*AK",

ABS SYSTEM FAILED.  TRUCK REAR END SLID TO RIGHT TOWARD TRAFFIC.  MY SON WAS ABLE TO REGAIN CONTROL.

AFTER I COMPLETED THE TURN AND STARTED TO HEAD SOUTH ON THE MAIN FOUR LANE ROAD I IMMEDIATELY FOUND OUT THAT THE POWER STEERING WAS QUITE ROUGH. QUITE ROUGH WAS NOT THE WORD FOR IT AS THERE WAS NO POWER STEERING! ABOUT A BLOCK FROM THAT POINT I HAD TO BRAKE AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NO POWER ASSISTED BRAKES ON THE VEHICLE. NO IDIOT LIGHTS CAME ON AT ALL AND THIS PRESENTED QUITE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WITH THE SNOW PLOW ATTACHED. BOTH THE FLUID IN THE MASTER BRAKE AND POWER STEERING CYLINDERS WERE RIGHT UP TO NORMAL LEVELS AND THE SERPENTINE BELT WAS RELATIVELY NEW AND INTACT! TRUST ME THAT I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS AT ALL FROM A VEHICLE THAT HAS ONLY 30,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH VARIOUS MAJOR PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT ITS SOMEWHAT YOUTHFUL HISTORY INCLUDING TWO (2) FULL BRAKE JOBS TO DATE. I'M JUST THANKFUL THAT NO ONE WAS HURT INCLUDING MYSELF. I WANT THIS LETTER TO BE RELAYED TO THE CHEVROLET ZONE MANAGER AND I WOULD LIKE THEIR INPUT ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. AS A CONSUMER THERE IS NO WAY THAT BOTH THE POWER STEERING AND BRAKES SHOULD HAVE GONE AT THE SAME TIME, PLUS, THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF A MAJOR PROBLEM FROM THE MESSAGE CENTER OR DASHBOARD.

AFTERWARDS THE ABS WAS COMING ON AT LOW SPEED WHEN IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND THE DEALER SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE FRONT LEFT ABS WHEEL SENSOR SINCE IT'S OUTPUT WAS OUT OF SPECIFICATION.  THE FACT THE BRAKES COMPLETELY FAILED DUE TO BAD COMPUTER PARTS IS OF REAL HIGH CONCERN TO ME AND OTHERS AROUND THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE SAFETY.  THE FAILURE MODE OF THE ABS COMPUTER COMPONENTS SHOULD NEVER PREVENT VEHICLE BRAKING.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CHEVY TO HAVE THE FAILED PARTS ANALYZED AS TO HOW THEY COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF BRAKING.  THEY HAVE DENIED MY REQUEST.  *LA",

I OWN A 2000 CHEVROLET SILVERADO.  I WENT TO GET MY FIRST INSPECTION STICKER BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER\u0019S TWO-YEAR INSPECTION STICKER WAS OUT OF DATE.  THE TRUCK FAILED INSPECTION BECAUSE THE REAR PARKING BRAKE SHOES WERE WORN AND THE PARKING BRAKE WOULD NOT WORK.  I WAS PUZZLED HOW THIS COULD BE WHEN I HAVE NEVER USED MY PARKING BRAKE.  I LIVE IN TEXAS AND HAVE NOT HAD A REASON TO USE IT.  MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE PARKING BRAKE SHOES WERE WORN BECAUSE THE CLIPS THAT HOLDS THEM IN PLACE HAD FAILED.  HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN (REFERENCE NUMBER 02-05-26-002 & 02-05-26-001) ABOUT THIS PARKING BRAKE ISSUE AND ADVISED ME TO CALL CHEVROLET.  I DID.    I WORKED WITH GREG SYNDER AT CHEVROLET\u0019S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND MY SERVICE REQUEST NUMBER WAS 1-126-315-169.  I, FROM THE START, VIEWED THIS AS A MANUFACTURER\u0019S DEFECT.  IN SHORT, CHEVROLET WOULD NOT FIX OR ASSIST IN THE COST OF THE REPAIRS BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  ALSO THEY NOTED THAT MY TRUCK WAS OUT OF THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY (3 YEARS/36000 MILES).      I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THE DECISION.  FIRST, HOW CAN THIS BE NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR IF THE PARKING BRAKE HAS NEVER BEEN USED?  ALSO, WHO REPLACES THEIR PARKING BRAKE SHOES ON A VEHICLE THAT IS 3 YEARS OLD AND THE PARKING BRAKE AGAIN HAS NEVER BEEN USED?  EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN USED, THE PARKING BRAKE SHOULD BE ONE OF THE LAST ITEMS ON A VEHICLE THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  I AM REPLACING THE PARKING BRAKE SHOES BEFORE I REPLACE MY BRAKES WHICH I USE EVERYDAY.      I FEEL THIS MATTER IS A SAFETY ISSUE BESIDES BEING A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT.

WE'VE TAKEN IT IN TO THE DEALER, WHO SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  THEY ALSO SAID THIS TWICE BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT THE FIRST TIME.  NOW IT'S ACTING UP AGAIN, AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  I'M SURE IT WILL GO OUT AGAIN, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.      I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WITH 2002 CHEVY TRUCK, AND THEY HAVE HAD THEIR TRANSMISSION EITHER CHECKED OR REPLACED ALREADY.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE TRANSMISSIONS BEING USED ARE NOT HEAVY-DUTY ENOUGH TO LAST.  I'M WORRIED, BECAUSE OUR EXTENDED WARRANTY IS RUNNING LOW, AND I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRANSMISSION WILL GO OUT AFTER THE WARRANTY IS UP.      IF THE TRANSMISSIONS BEING USED ARE NOT THE CORRECT ONE FOR THIS TRUCK, I THINK A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THE BUYERS TO BE STUCK WITH THIS PROBLEM.  CHECK THE STATS AT YOUR DEALERSHIPS... I'M WILLING TO BET THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUCKS BEING LOOKED AT FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM.

IT REQUIRED \"ADJUSTMENT\" AND I WAS CHARGED $112.50.  I WAS SURPRISED  THE PARKING BRAKE REQUIRED ADJUSTMENT SINCE IT IS NOT USED TO STOP THE VEHICLE, BUT RATHER USED TO KEEP IN PLACE WHEN PARKED AND IT WAS RARELY USED SINCE WE LIVE ON FLAT TERRAIN.  I WAS FURTHER SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BUT I LET THIS GO SINCE I WAS TOLD IT WAS A WEARABLE PART.  I DID NOT SEE THE ACTUAL PARKING BRAKE PADS BUT WAS CONCERNED THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO ADJUST THEM AND HEY REQUIRED ADJUSTMENT AFTER SUCH SHORT OF MILEAGE.  AGAIN AT 66,023 MILES, THE PARKING BRAKE CEASED WORKING FOR THE SECOND TIME.  THIS IS JUST 36,036 MILES AFTER THEY WERE ADJUSTED.  AFTER LOOKING AT THE ORIGINAL PARKING BRAKE PADS, THE FRONT TOP OF THE PAD WAS WORN ALMOST COMPLETELY AWAY WHILE THE BACK PAD WAS WORN VERY LITTLE.  THIS COST ME AN ADDITIONAL $228.84 TO HAVE THE PADS REPLACED AS THEY COULD NO LONGER BE ADJUSTED.  I DID NOTICE THE NEW PADS WERE OF A DIFFERENT DESIGN WITH A LARGER CLIP THAT HOLDS THEM IN PLACE, APPLYING MORE PRESSURE OVER A LARGER AREA.  ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICIAN, THIS NEW BRACKET HELPS HOLD THE PAD IN PLACE SO THAT WEAR, WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, DOES NOT OCCUR.  THIS WOULD SUGGEST THE ORIGINAL PAD AND RETAINING CLASP WAS POORLY DESIGNED CAUSING ABNORMAL WEAR ON THE PARKING BRAKES.  EVERY CHANCE I GET, I SPEAK WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING 2000 SERIES TRUCKS AND ALMOST ALL THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH, THEIR PARKING BRAKES ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL.  OF THOSE THAT WERE WORKING, THEY HAD THEM REPLACED.   I KEEP METICULOUS RECORDS FOR THE SERVICE ON MY VEHICLE AND IT IS NOT DRIVEN HARD OR ABUSED IN ANY MANNER.

(NOT AN INTUITIVE CORRECTION.)  3.  TURN THE HEADLIGHT MANUAL SWITCH TO ON.

I WAS TOLD THIS NOISE IS NORMAL TO \"ALL\" 2000 CHEVROLET AND GMC TRUCKS WITH THE 5.3 LITER ENGINE.  I ASKED HOW AN ENGINE KNOCK CAN BE NORMAL TO A BRAND NEW ENGINE AND WAS TOLD THAT THE NOISE WAS CALLED \"PISTON SLAP\" WHICH GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE OF THIS \"DEFECT\" AND WAS WORKING ON A FIX.  I THEN EXPLAINED TO THE SERVICE WRITER, SINCE I'VE WORKED AS A MECHANIC, THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD A NEW OR REBUILT ENGINE KNOCK UNLESS THERE WAS A MISTAKE MADE OR A FAULTY PART INSTALLED.  I'VE HEARD HIGH MILEAGE ENGINES WITH A KNOCK PROBLEM, AND I'VE HEARD HIGH MILEAGE ENGINES WITH \"PISTON SLAP\".  AFTER RESEARCH I FOUND OUT GM WAS GOING TO REPLACE THE FAULTY PISTONS WITH GM'S NEW DESIGN PISTONS AND THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE \"PISTION SLAP\" ISSUE.  AFTER TALKING WITH ANOTHER DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS ISSUE, I WAS TOLD THAT GM HAS REPLACED A FEW ENGINES WITH THE NEW DESIGNED PISTIONS WHICH NOW STILL HAVE THE \"PISTON SLAP\".  I WAS SHOWN  BULLETIN # 01-06-01-028 WHICH STATED MODELS:1999-2002 CHEVROLET/GMC PICKUP & UTILITY MODELS,2002 CADILLAC ESCALADE (2WD) WITH 4.8L,5.3L OR 6.0L ENGINES MAY EXHIBIT AN ENGINE KNOCK NOISE THAT BEGINS IN THE FIRST 12,000-15,000 MILES OF USE.  THE KNOCK NOISE IS MOST OFTEN NOTICED DURING START-UP AND TYPICALLY DISAPPEARS WITHIN THE FIRST 5-30 SECONDS (MAY LAST LONGER IN EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES)  SINCE WE LIVE IN ALASKA THIS IS VERY TRUE.  THE NOISE IS USUALLY MORE NOTICEABLE ON THE INTIAL START-UP WHEN THE TEMPTURE IS BELOW 50 DEGREES AND MAY BE MORE PRONOUNCED ON THE FIRST START FOLLOWING A LONG TRIP.  THE NOISE \"MAY\" BE CAUSED BY AN INTERACTION BETWEEN CARBON THAT HAS FORMED ON THE PISTON, THE PISTON MOTION AND THE CYLINDER WALL.  AT THIS TIME, ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THIS CONDITION BY REPLACING THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY OR PISTONS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  OUR TRUCK'S PERFORMANCE HAS GONE DOWN DUE TO THE KNOCK SENSOR DETECTING THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM.*AK",

ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT(8/22/00) IN ATLANTA, GA, I SAW A LADY WHOSE FIRESTONE WILDNERNESS AT 16\" TIRE SEPARATED FROM ITS TREAD, JUST LIKE ALL THOSE INCIDENTS OF THE 15\" TIRE.  ON MY 2000 CHEVY TRUCK I HAVE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT 16\" TIRES.  WHAT IS TO PREVENT THOSE TIRES FROM A TREAD SEPARATION AND CAUSING A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT!!!  I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND A HUSBAND.  IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE IF A TIRE SEPARATION HAPPENED ON MY VEHICLE CAUSING MY DEATH.  EVER SINCE I BOUGHT MY NEW TRUCK LAST SEPTEMBER '99, I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH THOSE FIRESTONE TIRES.  ONLY AFTER 4,000 MILES THE FRONT TIRES STARTED CUPPING AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  NOW AGAIN, AFTER 6,000 MORE MILES(AFTER ALIGNMENTS AND TIRE ROTATIONS) THE FRONT TIRES ARE DOING THE SAME THING.  I WISH TO CHANGE OUT THESE TIRES TO MICHELIN TIRES, SINCE I HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH MY OTHER VEHICLE('96 CHEVY SUBURBAN 4X4) AND ITS MICHELIN TIRES.  I'M VERY UPSET AND SCARED TO DRIVE MY 2000 CHEVY TRUCK WITH THOSE FIRESTONE TIRES ON IT.  I NEED TO FIND OUT IF FIRESTONE CAN BE MADE TO REPLACE MY TIRES ON MY TRUCK ALSO.  I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF SOMEONE CAN CONTACT ME REGARDING AN ANSWER TO REPLACING MY TIRES.  THANK YOU.  SINCERELY,  DONNA BROWN( DOT NUMBER: W273 WMB TIRE SIZE: P265/75R16 )",

THE FAILED CONDITION MAY BE THAT THE VEHICLE IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO LAUNCH IN 3RD AND THEN DOWN SHIFTS AFTER A DELAY.  THIS IS A POTENTIALY DANGEROUS CONDITION THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT WHILE CROSSING TRAFFIC OR ENTERING TRAFFIC.  I HAVE FOUND VIA THE INTERNET THAT MANY OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM WITH BOTH 1999 AND 2000 MODELS.  THIS PROBLEM IS VERY INTERMITTENT AND CAN NOT BE REPRODUCED WITH REGULARITY.  BECAUSE THE PROBLEM CAN NOT BE REPRODUCED I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME AT THIS POINT.  THE DEALER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE FAILURE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM 3 TIMES IN 3 MONTHS AND 3000 MILES.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR VEHICLE OWNERS TO GET GM TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS SO INTERMITTENT.  GM HAS TO BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN ON THE INTERNET.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I CAN HELP IN ANY WAY WITH YOUR INVESTIGATION.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP.",
