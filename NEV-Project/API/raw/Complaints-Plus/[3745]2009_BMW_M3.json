I HAVE EMAILED BMW OF NA AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE RECENT RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT INCLUDE THE M SERIES. I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD COST UP TOWARDS $5000 TO FIND A LOOSE WIRE.

I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS A LOOSE WIRE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT AS A COMMON FACTOR, LIKE HITTING A BUMP IN THE ROAD.

BASICALLY, THE 2ND GEAR WILL FAIL TO CATCH / ENGAGE WHEN I PUT MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL CAUSING THE CAR STALL FOR A SECOND OR TWO. AFTER THAT, THE GEAR WILL ENGAGE ABRUPTLY AND I WILL BE PULLED VIOLENTLY FORWARD. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL NEAR-ACCIDENT SITUATIONS:    1. I ALMOST REAR-ENDED SOMEONE WHEN THE GEAR ENGAGED ABRUPTLY WITH THE CAR JERKING FORWARD AT A STOP LIGHT WHEN IT TURNED GREEN AS I WAS APPROACHING, SLOWING DOWN TO 2ND GEAR.    2. I WAS ALMOST T-BONED AT A NON-REGULATED INTERSECTION. I WAS SLOWING DOWN WHEN APPROACHING THE INTERSECTION. THE CAR DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR FOR ME AND ABOUT 1/4 WAY INTO THE INTERSECTION, I SAW A VEHICLE SPEEDING DOWN TOWARDS THE INTERSECTION ON MY LEFT. I TRIED TO ACCELERATE TO GET OUT OF THE INTERSECTION BUT THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO ENGAGE FOR A FULL 2 SECONDS. I BARELY MISSED THE VEHICLE T-BONING INTO MY CAR.    THERE IS NO APPARENT EVENTS THAT HAVE LED UP TO THE FAILURE. THE CAR BEHAVES LIKE THAT ON THE FIRST DAY I BOUGHT IT. THIS FAILURE WOULD HAPPEN EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE CAR IN AUTOMATIC MODE, SO THAT THE CAR'S COMPUTER WILL DOWNSHIFT FOR ME. I ALREADY BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE POTENTIAL SAFETY RAMIFICATIONS, BUT THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT CLAIMED THAT BMW NORTH AMERICA HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT CLAIMING THAT IT IS NORMAL TRANSMISSION BEHAVIOR AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO TO CORRECT IT.    OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME AND I AM ASTONISHED THAT BMW WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO RECTIFY ITS PROBLEM. *TR",

BMW SAYS THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT TO BE THE CASE.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T DOWNSHIFT AT LOWER SPEEDS.  IN FACT, ONLY \"THINKING\" AND PROCEEDING TO DOWNSHIFT AFTER THE ACCELERATOR IS APPLIED.  BY THEN, IT'S TOO LATE.  AS A DRIVER, YOU EXPECT FORWARD MOMENTUM AS SOON AS THE ACCELERATOR IS APPLIED... NOT THAT IT DOWN SHIFTS AT THAT POINT.  PLUS, THE READING DISPLAY SUGGESTS IT IS IN FACT DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR... BUT I ASSURE YOU, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.  THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME THE SCENARIO IS MENTIONED.  SAY COMING FROM 35 MPH OR HIGHER SO THE VEHICLE IS IN A HIGHER GEAR (5 OR 6) AND THEN YOU SLOW TO SAY 10 MPH AND THEN TRY TO ACCELERATE.... SAY IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC. *TR",

TO AVOID AN ONCOMING CAR PREMATURELY HEADING IN MY DIRECTION, I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO HASTEN THE COMPLETION OF MY TURN, BUT THE  CAR DID NOT RESPOND BECAUSE OF THE CLUTCH LAG. I NARROWLY AVOIDED BEING HIT.
