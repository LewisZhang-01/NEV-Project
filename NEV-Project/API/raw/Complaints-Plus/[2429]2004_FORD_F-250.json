Upon going over forums this is a major common issue amongst many ford owners. I also have a ground short from unknown location not sure as to what has caused this but assuming it has to do with the wiring harnesses to the ficm.  I feel Ford should be in repair of this due to the large amount of issues across the nation of 6.0 owners but this is a very dangerous situation for owners. Not having steering control in such a large truck is extremely dangers.  Previous owner had same issue and replaced the ficm and said it shouldn\u2019t ever be an issue I feel there is a wiring issue that needs to be addressed.",

I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO START IT UP AGAIN UNTIL THE MORNING OF AUGUST FIFTEEN.  IT WOULD NOT START.  WHEN I TURNED THE KEY, IT CRANKED, ACTED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO START, THEN BACK TO JUST CRANKING.
