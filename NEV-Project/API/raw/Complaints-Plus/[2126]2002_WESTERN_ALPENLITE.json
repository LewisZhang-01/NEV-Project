ON THE TRIP BACK I NOTICED TWO LEFT SIDE TIRES WITH BULGE IN SIDEWALLS OF BOTH TIRES AND SEVERE WEAR PATTERN ON OUTER EDGE OF TIRE.  INFLATED TO 80 LBS, CHECKED AT MOST STOPS.   50 DEGREES, DRY ROADS. 60 MPH CONSTANT.  WENT TO GOODYEAR DEALER IN TUSCON AZ. AND HAD THESE TWO PLUS THE REMAINING (VISUALLY GOOD ONE) REPLACED.  THESE WERE WRANGLER HT 235/85 16S SERIES E. ABOUT 20,000 ON TIRES, AGE APPROX 4 YEARS FROM DATE OF TRAILER PURCHASE.  I SINCERELY BELIEVE THE BLOWOUT WAS TIRE DEFECT CAUSED BUT DIDN'T HAVE IT CHECKED BECAUSE OF NO PRIOR PROBLEMS.  THE DEALER GAVE ME 75% REDUCTION ON COST OF NEW TIRES FOR THE TWO SHOWING DEFECT.   *NM",
