EVEN WITH GMC CORPORATE INVOLVEMENT, ISSUE WAS NOT CORRECTED DESPITE REPLACEMENT OF NUMEROUS SENSORS, ETC.   IN ORDER TO AFFORD TO BUY A NEW 2013 VEHICLE,  I TRADED THAT TRUCK AND ANOTHER FOR THE ABOVE-NOTED GMC TRUCK AND 2-DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE THE SAME PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED AT THE VERY SAME SPOT ON MY DRIVE HOME FROM WORK.  I CALLED GMC AND NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY CANNOT FIX THE PROBLEM SO I WILL WAIT FOR THREE MORE INSTANCES AND WITH DRIVING A LOANER CAR FOR UP TO 3-WEEKS AT A TIME AND WILL INVOLVE THE LEMON LAW FOR DEFECTS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP.  OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO  NOTHING EXCEPT PROVIDE GMC WITH MORE TAXPAYER-FUNDED BAILOUT MONEY!  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT DEFECTS WITH THIS COMPLICATED SYSTEM THAT IS SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE CARS' RUNNING THAT IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED.
