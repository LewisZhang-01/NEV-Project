SEEING MY PREVIOUS IMPALA HAD THE SAME ISSUE FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I OWNED THAT VEHICLE, 178K MILES DRIVEN, I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECT IN THIS MODEL.  I DIDN'T PAY FOR A NEW MODULE ON THE OLDER MODEL AS THE LIGHT WAS INTERMITTENT.      I SEE ONLINE SOMETHING ABOUT PASSENGER SEAT BEING LOWERED OR PLACING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE ON THE PASSENGER SEAT CAN CAUSE THIS.  I WILL TRY TO MOVE SEAT AND NOT PLACE CELL PHONE ON SEAT.      STILL THERE IS STILL AN ISSUE WITH THIS SYSTEM IF OTHERS ARE REPORTING THE SAME ISSUE.  *TR",
