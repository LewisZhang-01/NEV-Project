THE ENGINE STARTED SHAKING IMMEDIATELY AND WITHIN SECONDS DIED. SHE CALLED ME OUT AND I TOOK A LOOK AT THE CAR. IT WAS DEAD.

I AM NOT MECHANICALLY-INCLINED, SO WHEN I GOOGLED WHAT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED, I SAW SEVERAL COMMENTS THAT IT COULD BE AS MINOR AS A DAMAGED OIL PAN THAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO SHUT DOWN. FIGURING IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING MINOR, I CALLED AAA (HAD TO WAIT A FEW DAYS SINCE THEIR LINES WERE DOWN) AND HAD THE CAR TOWED DOWN THE STREET TO A SERVICE STATION. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THE ASSESSMENT FROM THE MECHANIC: APPARENTLY DURING THE COLLISION, THE TIMING BELT SLIPPED AND CAUSED THE PISTONS TO BEND. THIS WOULD COST SEVERAL THOUSAND TO FIX.

THE WORST PART ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT HAPPENED DURING A COLLISION, OUR INSURANCE CHALKED THIS UP TO \"WEAR AND TEAR\" AND WE WERE FORCED TO JUNK THE CAR.

ENGINE DAMAGE WAS CATASTROPHIC AND REQUIRED EXTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE REPAIRS (3 WEEKS AND APPROXIMATELY $2,700). SNAPPED TIMING BELT ALSO BENT PISTONS AND VALVES AND REQUIRED THE WATER PUMP TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS CLEARLY A KNOWN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY CHEVROLET, RATHER THAN HIDING BEHIND THE 60,000 MILE REPLACEMENT, WHICH IS LAUGHABLY LOW FOR A TIMING BELT. FURTHER - MY TIMING BELT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT 50,000 MILES AND THUS NOT ONLY DID A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP LIE TO ME, THEY PUT MY LIFE AT RISK BY KNOWING THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT WOULD INEVITABLY OCCUR LONG BEFORE THE NEXT SCHEDULED BELT REPLACEMENT. THIS CAR HAS BEEN METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED WITH OIL CHANGES EVERY 3,000 MILES AND ONLY 5,000-10,000 MILES DRIVEN/YEAR. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE TIMING BELT TO SNAP OTHER THAN BEING A FAULTY PART THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  *TR",

US TAX PAYERS HAD TO BAIL THE COMPANY OUT WHY CAN'T THEY TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM?

ON MAY 21 OF 2010 WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL LODI CA, TO SACRAMENTO CA, THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING CRACKED. I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT TO CLASS AND HAD TO PAY OVER 100.00 DOLLARS TO GET MY VEHICLE TOWED. WHEN I GOT THE CAR HOME I NOTICED THAT THE THERMOSTAT WAS MADE OF A \"PLASTIC\" MATERIAL. HOW COULD SOMETHING THAT FLOWS COOLANT AND HOLDS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE COOLING SYSTEM BE MADE OF \"PLASTIC.\" I THEN DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE PART, AND FINDING OUT THAT THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A FACTORY CORRECT REPLACEMENT. SO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE IS AT 125,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED, ALL NECESSARY TUNE-UPS, OIL CHANGES, TRANS. FLUID CHANGES, COOLANT FLUSH, PLUGS, ECT. I ALSO KNOW THIS IS NOT THE ONLY AVEO THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MULTIPLE TIMES. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR THE AVEO. ONCE AGAIN, WHY IS SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT MADE OF \"PLASTIC?\" I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE ENGINE GOT TO A HIGHER TEMP. THAN IT DID, I WOULD BE LOOKING AT A WARPED HEAD, ARE EVEN WORSE, A CRACKED BLOCK.  THAT COULD CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE AND EVEN A WRECK. I ALSO FEEL CHEVROLET SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS POOR JUDGMENT OF A PART. A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED AND A BETTER QUALITY PART SHOULD BE USED. I AM NOW FORCED TO REPLACE THIS PART WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM CHEVROLET, AND IT IS NOT CHEAP. I AM A COLLEGE STUDENT THAT BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR THE ECONOMICAL AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS \"RELIABILITY\" VALUE.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. I AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WOULD FEEL A RECALL IS DUE FOR THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING. [XXX] *TR",

ONCE, MY VEHICLE WAS TRANSPORTED HOME, I HAD MY MECHANIC TO COME OUT AND INSPECT MY VEHICLE.  MY MECHANIC LOOKED UNDER MY HOOD AND SAW THAT MY VEHICLE HAD LOST ALOT OF ANTIFREEZE/COOLANT.  HE LOOKED TO SEE WHAT CAUSE THIS AND REALIZED THAT THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING UNIT HAD BUSTED-ACTUALLY IT WAS SPLIT IN HALF.

THE USE OF TWO DISSIMILAR METALS UNDER THE HOOD OF A CAR WHERE SALT AND CORROSION ARE HIGHLY LIKELY IS EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED TO A CONSUMER.  I HAVE TO PAY MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET FOR A FILTER BOX REPLACEMENT WHEN THE FILTER BOX SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ENGINEERED THIS WAY.

THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO RADLEY CHEVROLET, WHERE THIS DIAGNOSIS WAS RENDERED.   RADLEY CHEVROLET HELD A NEW CAR OWNER'S ORIENTATION CLASS AT WHICH THEIR SERVICES AND HOURS WERE DISCUSSED.  CLASS TOPICS INCLUDED TIMELY OIL AND FILTER CHANGES.   NO MENTION WAS MADE,OR EMPHASIS PLACED, ON THE NEED FOR INSPECTION OF THE TIMING BELT AT 30,000 MILES OR ITS REPLACEMENT AT 60,000 MILES.  WHEN I MENTIONED THIS RECENTLY TO THE RADLEY CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER HE RESPONDED BY TELLING ME THAT ALL CHEVROLETS MADE IN THE USA USE TIMING CHAINS INSTEAD OF TIMING BELTS. HENCE HIS STAFF WOULD NOT THINK TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO INSPECT AND CHANGE THE TIMING BELT.  IT APPEARED THAT THIS LACK OF CONCERN OR TRAINING MAY HAVE EXTENDED TO SOME MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.  I WAS NOT ADVISED OF THE NEED FOR THIS INSPECTION AT EITHER OF THE TWO OIL CHANGES, PERFORMED BY RADLEY AROUND THE 30,000 MILE POINT.      THE TIMING BELT FAILED AT AN ODOMETER READING OF 60,331 MILES.  THE 331 MILES BEYOND THE 60,000-MILE RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT POINT SUGGEST THAT THE ODOMETER HAS AN ACCURACY BETTER THAN .55%.  CONSIDERING THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO MEASURE SPEED AND MILEAGE IN VEHICLES SOLD TO THE PUBLIC IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ANY ARE SO ACCURATE.   HAD OBSERVED THAT IN DRIVING FROM ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA TO FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA SHE WAS OFTEN AMONG THE SLOWEST ON THE ROAD IN SPITE OF SPEEDOMETER READINGS THAT SUGGEST SHE WAS DRIVING WELL ABOVE THE POSTED LIMIT.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SHE HAD HER HUSBAND RECORD THE ELAPSED TIME BETWEEN MILE-POSTS AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE TRAVELING AROUND 5 TO 6 MILES PER HOUR LESS THAN THE SPEEDOMETER READING.  THIS AMOUNTS TO AN ODOMETER READING FROM 6.25% TO 8.5% GREATER THAN ACTUAL DISTANCE TRAVELED.   HENCE AT AN ODOMETER READING OF 60,331 MILES, ACTUAL MILEAGE IS BETWEEN 56,560 AND 55,203 MILES.   *AK",
