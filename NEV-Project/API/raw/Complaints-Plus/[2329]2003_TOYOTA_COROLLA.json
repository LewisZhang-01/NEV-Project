AFTER THEY MADE THE DIAGNOSIS ON MY CAR THEY SAID THERE'S A SHORT CIRCUIT ON MY AIRBAG SPIRAL CABLE CLOCK SPRING W/C IS LOCATED INSIDE THE STEERING WHEEL. THEY SAID IF THIS SPIRAL CABLE IS DEFECTIVE ALL THE AIRBAGS IN MY CAR IS DISABLED AND WILL NOT DEPLOY IF I HIT ANOTHER CAR OR A TREE W/C IS REALLY LIFE THREATENING. MY QUESTION IS WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY $550.00 TO GET THAT SPIRAL CABLE REPLACED. AND ON THE OTHER HAND MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM NOT UNTIL WHEN THEY REPLACE THAT FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATOR LAST MAY 5. THEY EVEN ASK ME IF I HAD AN ACCIDENT RECENTLY.  I THINK THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT SINCE THEY'VE BEEN DOING ALL THE SERVICES ON MY CAR FOR 6 YEARS. OR IS THERE ANY RECALL ON THIS SPIRAL CABLE? I HOPE YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

I MANAGED TO SURVIVE WWII, WORKING FOR THE UNITED STATES POSTAL  SERVICE, I EVEN RECOVERED FROM A MAJOR STROKE.  WHY AM I BEING PLACED IN A POSITION OF ANXIETY, FEAR AND STRESS?  THE DEFECT IS DESCRIBED AS A MATTER OF 'DETERIORATION' OF MATERIAL OVER TIME. THAT MEANS BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER ARE AT RISK. I DUTIFULLY DEMAND MY PASSENGER(S) USUALLY A FAMILY MEMBER USE THE REAR SEAT BUT THAT PROVIDES NO ASSURANCE TO THE DRIVER. BUYING A NEW VEHICLE ISN'T AN ANSWER SINCE TAKATA SUPPLIES THEM AS WELL.  LIFE MAY NOT BE FAIR BUT TAKATA NOR TOYOTA HAVE ANY RIGHT TO JEOPARDIZE MY LIFE. I NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE SOME POSITIVE ACTION TO RESOLVE MY PROBLEM.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU ASAP.

I IMMEDIATELY GOT OFF THE FREEWAY WITHIN 5-7 SECONDS (THANK GOD I WAS ABLE TO), WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT COMPLETELY FROZE/SEIZED/LOCKED UP ON ME AND PROCEEDED TO SKID OUT ABOUT 15 FEET ALONG THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY ONLY A SECOND OR TWO AFTER GETTING OFF.

TOYOTA HAS OFFERED NO SOLUTION OR COMPROMISE AND CONTINUES TO ADVISE AGAINST HAVING A FRONT SEAT PASSENGER. FURTHER, THAT TOYOTA HAS NOT CONSIDERED THE SAFETY OF THE DRIVER IN THE RECALL IS UNCONSCIONABLE.      IN JAN 2015, I RECEIVED FROM TOYOTA A D3F-1 RECALL NOTICE REGARDING FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATOR MODULE WHICH WARNED AGAINST OPERATING THE VEHICLE WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED.  ON 02 FEB 2015 SANSONE TOYOTA ADVISED THAT PARTS WERE DUE IN THREE WEEKS.  ON 06 MAR 2015 SANSONE ADVISED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE PARTS WOULD ARRIVE BUT IN THE INTERIM IT WAS SAFE TO HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT.  ON 19 MAR 2015 SANSONE SCHEDULED MY CAR FOR AN AIRBAG INSPECTION ON 23  MARCH BUT FAILED TO PERFORM SAME.  INSTEAD, SANSONE AGAIN ADVISED IT WAS SAFE TO HAVE A FRONT SEAT PASSENGER - PROVIDED THE AIRBAG LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER STARTING THE CAR.      NOT SATISFIED, ON 24 MAR 2015 I CALLED TOYOTA HQ.  \"[XXX]\" ADVISED THAT PARTS WOULD NOT BE IN BEFORE MID-2015 AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT SANSONE SAID TOYOTA DOES NOT RECOMMEND HAVING A FRONT SEAT PASSENGER UNTIL THE FIX IS MADE.  I APPEALED AND [XXX] REFERRED ME TO \"[XXX].\"  I ADVISED [XXX] THAT I WAS AFRAID TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM.  [XXX] REFERRED ME TO \"TIFFANY BISHOP\" WHO TOLD ME NOT TO HAVE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED AND CONFIRMED MID-2015 AS THE EARLIEST DATE OF PART AVAILABILITY.  SHE ALSO ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER AVENUE OF APPEAL - SHE WAS THE END OF THE LINE.  THAT IS UNSATISFACTORY.    TOYOTA'S LACK OF RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION IS INADEQUATE, UNREASONABLE, AND UNREALISTIC.  I WANT MY CAR FIXED NOW SO I CAN TRANSPORT FRONT SEAT PASSENGERS.  *TR",

THIS IS BECOMING VERY FRUSTRATING AND SEEING THAT THIS CAR IS THE PRIMARY VEHICLE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR OUR FAMILY NOW WE SHOULD NOT HAVE FRONT SEAT PASSENGERS UNTIL PARTS BECOME AVAILABLE WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE, SO NOW WE HAVE TO RUN THE RISK OF BEING SEVERELY INJURED OR WORSE BECAUSE  THIS RECALL IS NOT BEING HANDLED PROPERLY BY TOYOTA AND THIS DEALERSHIP   WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE.

OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THESE AIRBAGS AND I'M WONDERING WHY MY TOYOTA IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL? I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY SINCE MY 17 YEAR OLD SON IS NOW DRIVING THE VEHICLE! THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR US!",

I HAVE CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY TOOK THE ISSUE VERY LIGHTLY AND SUGGESTED THAT THEIR AIRBAGS ARE ALL TESTED AND IF THERE WAS NO AIRBAG LIGHT ON PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT THEN THE AIRBAG WAS FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY. I INSISTED THAT SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG WITH THE AIRBAGS AND ARGUED THAT IF THEY ARE ALL SO PERFECT THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY RECALLS. FINALLY HE ASKED ME TO SEND THE PHOTOS TO DETERMINE IF THE AIRBAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED. I SENT THE ACCIDENT PHOTOS IN FEBRUARY 2014 AND HAVE SENT A REMINDER ON MARCH 2014 BUT THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED BACK.  I STRONGLY FEEL THAT TOYOTA IS IGNORING THIS ISSUE.

THEY HAD NOT EVEN TOUCHED MY CAR.  TWO DAYS WITHOUT ONES VEHICLE FOR IT TO NOT EVEN BE LOOKED AT. REALLY? THE ONLY TIME IT WAS MOVED I BELIEVE IN THOSE 2 WORKING DAYS WAS WHEN THEY PULLED IT OUT OF THE BAY IN ORDER TO MOVE IN NEWER VEHICLES AHEAD OF MINE.  I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND PICKED UP MY VEHICLE.  THEN, ON TOP OF THAT, THEY SEEMED TO CARE LESS THAT I WAS NOT GETTING MY VEHICLE AIR BAG REPLACEMENT.

I HAVE ALWAYS RAVED ABOUT TOYOTA AND WHAT GREAT CARS THEY HAVE AND THAT I WOULD NEVER DRIVE ANYTHING ELSE. AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER CARE LINE, I SOON REALIZED THAT THEY DON'T CARE AT ALL. THE REP WAS RUDE, AND BASICALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD DO. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND CAN HURT PEOPLE! I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER TOYOTA AGAIN..AND I HAVE INFORMED MY FAMILY THAT IF I DIE IN AN ACCIDENT FROM THIS ISSUE, THAT THEY GO FULL FORCE AFTER TOYOTA.

IN THE FIRST INCIDENT, THE CAR WENT FROM 52 TO 83, THE SECOND INCIDENT - 57 TO 90, THE 3RD INCIDENT - 65 TO 88, THE 4TH INSTANCE 75 TO 84 AND THE SCARIEST INCIDENT OF ALL - THE CAR WENT FROM 70 TO 105 MPH!!  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THE ONLY THING THAT SLOWED THE CAR DOWN (BESIDES MY CONTINUAL BRAKING) WAS THAT I STARTED CLIMBING A LARGE HILL. ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WAS WITNESSED BY A WYOMING HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER - OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND MANY MILES TO A TOWN - WHO THOUGHTFULLY GAVE ME DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO GET THE CAR TO STOP SAFELY (TURN ON YOUR EMERGENCY FLASHERS, PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND APPLY EVEN PRESSURE TO BRAKES - PUTTING CAR IN NEUTRAL GIVES MORE POWER TO BRAKES). THIS CAR HAS 60,000 MILES ON IT AND HAD NEVER BEEN ON A LONG TRIP BEFORE AND VERY RARELY ON A FREEWAY. I HAD NEVER USED THE CRUISE CONTROL BEFORE AND WILL NOT BE USING IT AGAIN. TOYOTA NEEDS TO ADD THE 2003 COROLLA TO THE RECALL AS IT OBVIOUSLY HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE 2005 - 2010.  TOYOTA WILL BE HEARING FROM ME TOMORROW. *TR",

VEH WAS PURCHASED FROM TOYOTA OF ORANGE IN CA. TWO DAYS LATER A HIT AND RUN DRIVER FORCED VEH TO SKID ACROSS FIVE LANES ON INTERSTATE 10 IN ONTARIO, CA, AND LANDED ATOP CENTER DIVIDER. THE VEHICLE WAS SENT TO REPAIR SHOP AND  \"REPAIRED\" AFTER APPROXIMATELY 5-8 MONTHS.  HOWEVER, THE CAR WAS NEVER PROPERLY REPAIRED, AND I COMPLAINED TO BOTH TOYOTA , AND TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY, ALLSTATE, BUT TOYOTA ADAMANTLY STATED THE VEH WAS WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  THE CAR WAS CONTINUALLY IN THE SHOP FOR THE BRAKES.  EVENTUALLY THE CARPET CAUSED THE ACCELERATOR TO BECOME STUCK AND THE CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL. I WAS FORCED TO REACH DOWN WHILE THE CAR MOVING AND PULL THE CARPET WITH BOTH HANDS TO RELEASE THE ACCELERATOR.  STEPPING ON THE BRAKES DID NOT HELP. NEITHER TOYOTA REPAIR NOR ALLSTATE WOULD HELP RESOLVE OUR COMPLAINTS SINCE 2003, WE WERE SIMPLY TOLD THAT THE VEH WAS FINE.  ADDITIONALLY I BELIEVE THE FRAME IS BENT,  LACK OF INTERLOCKING BRAKES CAUSING SKIDS, BRAKES ARE SOFT AND DROP TO FLOOR, AND POOR STEERING COLUMN.  THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS AND IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE WITHOUT INVOLVING NEAR MISS ACCIDENT EPISODES.  THE CAR SKIDS IF GOING AS LITTLE AS 5-10 MILES PER HOUR. I OFFERED TO GIVE THE CAR AWAY TO ANYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO INVESTIGATE MY COMPLAINTS, ALL TO NO AVAIL.  I JUST RECENTLY LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HEARD IN THE  BRAND NEW CAR WAS A HOLE IN THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  TOYOTA CONTINUALLY DENIED THIS FOR 5-6 YEARS, THEN BY ACCIDENT A VERY YOUNG NEWLY EMPLOYED STAFF AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE, INFORMED US THAT OUR COMPLAINT ABOUT LOUD AIR SOUNDING NOISE WAS A HOLE IN THE EXHAUST, WHICH HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY MAKING THE NOISE, AND BURNING OF EYES (MIGRAINES). THE BRAKES WERE REPAIRED EVERY 2-4 MONTHS OR LESS UNTIL I JUST REPORTED LESS FREQUENTLY. THE CAR IS NOW NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.

FOUR YEARS OF BUYING EXPENSIVE GASOLINE, AND I FIND OUT MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAS BURNED UP AND I NEED A NEW ONE FOR $1200.    I FOUND OUT THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS CAN BE DAMAGED IF FUEL IS BEING MIXED TO RICHLY, EVIDENT BY A SULFUR SMELL.  I BEGAN RESEARCHING THIS AND FOUND A TOYOTA TECHNICAL BULLETIN (HTTP://WWW.AUTOSAFETY.ORG/TOYOTA%2003-04%20COROLLA%20CATALYST.PDF) THAT STATES MY SPECIFIC MODEL 2003 COROLLA HAD A MANUFACTURERS ERROR ALL ALONG. THE ECM WAS SET INCORRECTLY TO MIX FUEL TOO RICHLY, AND THAT IF A CUSTOMER COMPLAINS OF AN EXCESSIVE SULFUR SMELL, THE ECM AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED UNDER WARRANTY!   THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER FAILED WHILE I WAS STILL UNDER A 60,000MILES WARRANTY, HOWEVER I WAS ON VACATION IN CALIFORNIA, AND CALLED A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEY TOLD ME MY WARRANTY DID NOT COVER THE SYSTEM, SO I WAITED TO GET IT FIXED.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER RETURNING TO COLORADO, AND DIDN'T COME BACK ON FOR 15,000 MILES.    AT 85,000 MILES, I FINALLY TOOK MY CAR TO BE FIXED BY A DEALERSHIP IN DENVER.  AFTERWARD, I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE TOYOTA BULLETIN, AND AN \"EMISSIONS WARRANTY\" THAT WOULD HAVE COVERED THE PROBLEM UP TO 8YRS OR  80,000 MILES.  NOW, TOYOTA REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE WORK TO FIX THE REAL ECM PROBLEM, BECAUSE I FOUND OUT 5000 MILES AFTER THIS SECRET WARRANTY RAN OUT  THAT THE TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS LYING TO ME OR INCOMPETENT!  IF YOU SEARCH ONLINE, THERE IS A PLETHORA OF OTHER TOYOTA CONSUMERS WHOM WERE LIED TO ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM!

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP ATTRIBUTED THE FAILURE TO BE \"CLIMATE BUT NO EXCUSES.\" THE REAR SUSPENSION HAD \"ROTTED\" (RUSTED) OUT. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT ALL COMMON.  I JUST SPOKE TO A TOYOTA MECHANIC WITH 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE - HE HAS NEVER SEEN THIS PROBLEM BUT SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE. HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER THE UNDERBODY HAD BEEN PROPERLY TREATED ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE. HE WOULD NOT EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN IN SUCH A YOUNG CAR - MORE LIKELY WITH A 10 YEAR OLD CAR. I DID NOT GET TO VISUALLY SEE THE BROKEN, ROTTED PARTS. TOYOTA REPAIRED THE PROBLEM AT MY EXPENSE - $604 - AND THEY RECENTLY OFFERED ME A SETTLEMENT FOR $301.

AS SHE DROVE ON HIGHWAY 17 NEAR SAN JOSE SHE TRIED TO STEP ON THE FOOT BRAKE TO MAINTAIN SAFETY CONTROL AT THE SPEED LIMIT OF 35 MILES PER HOUR WHILE GOING DOWN THE WINDING SLOPE.  HOWEVER THE CAR SEEMED TO HAVE NO BRAKE AND STARTED SPINNING WITH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRONT FIRST HIT THE CENTRAL CONCRETE DIVIDER THEN THE TAIL ALSO HIT THE DIVIDER AND THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED.  NO THIRD PARTY WAS INJURED AND NO PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT MY DAUGHTER GOT SOME BRUISES ON HER LEFT THIGH AND THE CAR ENDED UP WITH A TOTAL LOSS.  MY DAUGHTER THEN UNBUCKLED HERSELF FROM THE CAR SEAT AND CALLED THE POLICE WITH HER CELL PHONE THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS ADVISED TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED AT THE SCENE THE DRIVER SAID TO MY DAUGHTER THAT THE CAR GOT NO BRAKE AND HE HAD TO PUT ADDITIONAL CHAINS AND STOPPERS TO SECURE THE CAR WHILE TOWING.  SURPRISINGLY NONE OF THE AIRBAGS IN THE CAR WAS DEPLOYED IN THE ACCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO MY RECORDS, THE CAR WAS FULLY SERVICED BY THE DEALER, TOYOTA 101 IN REDWOOD CITY JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND AS RECENT AS A WEEK AGO THAT I HAD THE CAR'S ENGINE BELT CHANGED ALSO BY TOYOTA 101 BEFORE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.   IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING I SUSPECT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME DEFECT IN THE CAR SAFETY SYSTEM INCLUDING THE AIRBAGS AND FOOT BRAKE.  I AND MY INSURANCE ADJUSTER TRIED TO CONTACT THE MANAGER OF TOYOTA 101 BY PHONE FOR NUMEROUS TIMES BUT TO NO AVAIL.

SURE ENOUGH, THIS VEHICLE HAS THE FIRST CATALYTIC CONVERTER (THERE ARE TWO, IN TANDEM) IS COUPLED DIRECTLY TO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD.

AFTER THE COLLISION, THE BRAKES WERE COMPLETELY INOPERABLE.  THIS COLLISION RESULTED IN INJURIES TO THE DRIVER OF THE COROLLA, AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END OF THE COROLLA.  IN THE SECOND INCIDENT (AUGUST 29, 2002), THE BRAKES FAILED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PARK, RESULTING IN A COLLISION WITH A PARKED CAR.
