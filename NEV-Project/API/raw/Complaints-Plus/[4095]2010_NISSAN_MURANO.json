THE PROBLEM IS THE ABS ACTUATOR. MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2009 WITH THE DEFAULT PARTS, YET IT WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL. THIS FAULTY BRAKE SYSTEM CAN BE FATAL IF NOT ADDRESSED. THE COST OF THE REPAIRS IS IN EXCESS OF $2,000 AND NISSAN SHOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIR FOR THE FAULTY ABS ACTUATOR.

I WAS BILLED $1840.81 FOR THIS REPAIR THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I WAS THEN TOLD THE DIAGNOSTICS SAID THEY NEEDED TO REPLACE THE \"SEAT OCCUPANT SENSOR\" FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $4210.81 BECAUSE THE PART WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SO THE WHOLE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT HAD TO BE REPLACED!    I WAS THEN ADVISED TO CALL NISSAN'S CORPORATE CUSTOMER CARE AT 1 800 NISSAN1. MY MAUS SERVICE CONSULTANT SAID SHE HAD SEEN CUSTOMERS WITH \"130000 MILES AND A BLOWN TRANSMISSION\" AND CUSTOMER CARE HAD COVERED THE REPAIR. SHE ALSO SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY REIMBURSE MY $1840.81 SINCE THE REPAIR DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE.    I CALLED CUSTOMER CARE AND DETAILED MY SITUATION. A WEEK LATER THEY CALLED TO TELL ME THAT MY REQUEST HAD BEEN DENIED.    I REACHED OUT TO MAUS NISSAN VIA THEIR FACEBOOK AND WEB PAGES AS WELL AS A YELP AND GOOGLE REVIEWS.

THERE WERE NO CURVES IN THE ROAD AT THAT TIME. ALL OF THE SUDDEN MY SUN ROOF GLASS EXPLODED WITH A HUGE BANG SOUND, EXTREMELY LOUD, AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A LOT OF WIND NOISE. I HAD THE INTERIOR SUNROOF SCREEN CLOSED, THANK GOODNESS. OTHERWISE I WOULD'VE BEEN COVERED IN TEMPERED GLASS.  I PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AS I COULD, INTO A GAS STATION PARKING LOT TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION.   UPON INSPECTION, I NOTICED THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY A 2' X 1' HOLE IN THE CENTER OF  MY FRONT SUNROOM. SHARDS OF GLASS WERE EVERYWHERE, AND THE INTERIOR NETTING WAS SHREDDED.

REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITANCE OF OPERATION.

I WAS AGAIN TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM UPDATE. THE ERRONEOUS NAVIGATION INFORMATION IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT DIRECTS YOU TO GO INTO LANES/EXITS THAT DO NOT EXIT AND POSES A DANGER WHEN, AS A DRIVER, YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE, SOMETIMES AT THE LAST MINUTE, CROSSING THROUGH HIGHWAY TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE CORRECT LANE TO EXIT (VERY SCARY).

WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSFER CASE IS NOT RECALLED OR COVERED UNDER THEIR EXTENDED TRANSMISSION WARRANTY. NISSAN EXTENDED THEIR CVT TRANSMISSION WARRANTY TO 120K MILES IN CASE OF AN ALL OUT TRANSMISSION FAILURE BUT WON'T WARRANT OR RECALL THE CAUSE - THE TRANSFER CASE.

NISSAN KNOWS THIS IS AN ISSUE BUT HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. THEIR GENIUS IDEA IS TO EXTEND THE CVT WARRANTY TO 100K MILES INSTEAD OF FIXING THE SAFETY ISSUE. THIS HAS OCCURRED TO ME TWO TIMES ONCE TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON DC TO NYC IN APRIL, 2010 AND DC TO OUTER BANKS, NC IN JULY BOTH UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS (HIGH TEMP AND BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC).  I'VE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE DEALER BOTH TIMES AND THE RESPONSE WAS WE CAN'T FIX IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE SYMPTOMS OR NEVER HEARD OF SUCH ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE TSB RELATED TO THIS ISSUE FOR 1ST GENERATION CVTS.

THEY ADVISE THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE AUTO SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE BROUGHT TO THE DEALER.  I AM EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM WITH MY AUTO AND HAVE NOTIFIED BOTH NISSAN (FILE 670 4193) AND BARRON NISSAN.  AS OF TODAY, BOTH HAVE FAILED TO ADVISE HOW THIS CAN BE CORRECTED.  I AM AWARE THAT IN 2009, NISSAN HAD A RECALL (#08V521000) FOR THEIR PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG LIGHT ON THE MURANO. *TR  UPDATED 03/12/10",
