THE TRANSMISSION SHOP RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM, WHICH TOOK ABOUT A MONTH, AND FOUND THAT THE CONTROL MODULE HAD MALFUNCTIONED. ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC, IT WAS SENDING THE SIGNAL TO REV THE ENGINE AND CUT THE POWER TO THE BRAKES WHEN THE CAR WAS IDLING IN GEAR. HE SAID HE FOUND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MAKE/MODEL/YEAR RANGE, BUT THERE WAS NO RECALL BECAUSE NO SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATHS HAD OCCURRED BECAUSE OF IT YET. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME TILL THIS HAPPENS, WHEN A VEHICLE REVS ITS ENGINE AND CUTS POWER TO THE BRAKES SIMULTANEOUSLY.   ONCE THE PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED, THE TRANSMISSION SHOP WAS ABLE TO ORDER THE SOFTWARE FROM HYUNDAI TO REPROGRAM THE ECM, WHICH SOLVED THE PROBLEM.",

I HAVE READ UP EXTENSIVELY ON THIS AND FOUND MANY WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT ON WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM WEBSITE.  IT APPEARS MANY DEALERSHIPS ARE AWARE AS THEY HAVE HAD VEHICLE IN TO BE PROBLEM SOLVED WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM MORE SO THAN A MECHANICAL PROBLEM.  AFTER HAVING MY CAR INTO 4 DIFFERENT SHOPS INCLUDING A DEALERSHIP THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WITH NO FIX AND ONLY A 'IF WE CAN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM WE CAN'T FIX IT' RESPONSE I GET MAD. WE HAVE RULED OUT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE; TRANSMISSION, ENGINE, RELAYS, ETC. FOR 4 MONTHS IT HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF SHOPS TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. WHICH IS HAPPENING SO OFTEN NOW IT IS NOT SAFE AND I AM HAVING TO TAKE OUT A LOAN TO TRY AND BUY A NEW CARE. I CANNOT TRADE THIS IN DUE TO THE PROBLEM.  WHEN IT IS RUNNING IT RUNS GREAT, UNTIL IT SLAMS INTO 3RD GEAR WITH NO WARMING AND YOU LOOSE ALL ACCELERATION OR IT DIES COMPLETELY. YOU CAN SHUT IT OFF AND RESTART IT AND IT RUNS AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED, UNTIL IT STALLS AGAIN. THE LAST MECHANIC HAVING VERIFIED EVERYTHING HE WAS TOLD TO CHECK HAS DETERMINED IT MUST BE IN THE COMPUTER. SOME INDIVIDUALS SAID EARLY ON THEY HAD THE COMPUTERS REPLACES (AT A BIG COST) ONLY TO HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN. MY CAR IS 10 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS 118,000 MILES ON IT.  I HATE HAVING TO GET RID OF THIS CAR BUT THERE IS NO WAY IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE IN THIS CONDITION.  HYUNDAI SEEMS TO BE IGNORING THIS COMPLAINT AS NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED AND NO HELP IN REPAIRING THE PROBLEM.  TOO MANY CARS AT THE APRX MILEAGE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND LEADS ME TO BELIEVE A RECALL IS IN ORDER OR FINANCIAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE MONTHS OF REPAIR TO FIX IT SHOULD BE MADE.

WHEN I BRAKE, OCCASIONALLY FLUID FROM A BEVERAGE MAY FALL ONTO AND INTO THE GEAR SHIFTER. THE SHIFTER ENCLOSURE ALLOWS FLUID TO FLOW INTO IT AND COLLECT AROUND A CONNECTOR PROVIDING ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT END-UP COMMUNICATING TO THE CAR'S COMPUTER'AND THEN ONTO THE TRANSMISSION THAT I DOWNSHIFTED WHEN I DID NOT DOWN SHIFT. THE RESULT IS I HAVE TO FLIP OVER TO 'SHIFTRIONIC' MODE BECAUSE THE CAR IS PERFORMING LIKE I PUT IT IN THAT MODE WHEN I DID NOT. I TRY TO UPSHIFT BUT IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY'I END UP BEING DISTRACTED TRYING TO PUT THE CAR IN THE RIGHT GEAR AND THE CAR ENDS UP GOING FASTER THAN I INTENDED.  I GENERALLY DON'T NOTICE THE DOWNSHIFT UNTIL THE ENGINE STARTS ROARING'.DROPPING INTO SECOND GEAR ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY IS VERY UNSETTLING. AGAIN, I TRY TO MAINTAIN MY SPEED BY PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR AND ATTEMPTING TO UPSHIFT AND IT'S VERY DISTRACTING.   I HAVE HAD A 'PLUS 5' DRIVER RATING FOR OVER 2 DECADES AND I OWN TWO OTHER CARS AND I NEVER BEEN TICKETED WITH EITHER CAR. BUT I RECENTLY HAVE BEEN TICKETED TWICE WITH THE SONATA AND IN BOTH CASES THE CAR DOWN-SHIFTED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. THE PROBLEM STARTED SPORADICALLY ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND INITIALLY I DID NOT KNOW THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THE BEVERAGE SPILL TO CREATE A SHIFTER MALFUNCTION, SO IT'S NOT OBVIOUS WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR A WHILE.  THE PROBLEM IS SO COMMON THAT THERE ARE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE. IT IS A SIMPLE BUT POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW.",

AFTER NUMEROUS CALLS, MAILING INVOICE WITH CHECK NUMBER, FAXING SAME ON 3/20/15, I GOT A PHONE CALL TODAY REQUIRING ME TO UPLOAD A FILE TO A PARTICULAR WEBSITE. I CALLED AND WENT THRU 2 MORE PEOPLE, ONE OF WHOM HAD MY HARD COPY INVOICE DOCUMENT IN HAND, COULD NOT ENTER MY PERSONAL INFO. (PHONE #, ADDRESS, EMAIL ADDRESS) AND, WAS NOT IN THE DEPT.

THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SEAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT AWAY FOR REPAIR.  HOWEVER, AFTER THIS REPAIR WAS MADE, THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND WOULD NOT GO OFF.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THE SEAT BELT PRETENSION/BUCKLE WAS DEFECTIVE AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST TO ME OF OVER $400.  SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH HYUNDAI SONATAS.  AS OF YET, I UNDERSTAND THAT NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED BUT THAT THIS MATTER IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS THE AIR BAGS MAY NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT.  I WAS SPECIFICALLY TOLD THIS AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I URGE YOU TO TAKE ACTION AND ISSUE A RECALL ON THIS.  I, LIKE MOST OTHERS IN THIS SITUATION, CANNOT AFFORD TO SPEND $400+ DOLLARS TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED.  HOWEVER, I ALSO CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE ALLOW PASSENGERS TO SIT IN THE FRONT SEAT KNOWING THE AIR BAGS MAY NOT DEPLOY.  OF COURSE, I ALSO AM CONCERNED FOR MY OWN SAFETY AS A DRIVER AND THE AIR BAG ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AS WELL.  IT SEEMS AS THOUGH HYUNDAI KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM, BUT OBVIOUSLY, UNLESS THE NHTSA ISSUES A RECALL, NO ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AND THOSE OF US IN THIS SITUATION WILL CONTINUE TO PUT OURSELVES AND OUR PASSENGERS AT RISK.

I ASKED MY MECHANIC AND CALLED 2 LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERS AND ALL AGREED THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUSE/RELAY BOX. AFTER CONSULTING A FEW HYUNDAI FORUMS I LEARNED THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING SOME 2006 AND 2007 HYUNDIAS AND THAT OWNERS WERE PAYING BETWEEN $700 TO $1200 TO REPLACE THE FAULTY PART. MANY OWNERS ARE UPSET THAT HYUNDAI DOES NOT ISSUE A RECALL. ON MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014 THE STALK STOPPED WORKING. A CALL TO HYUNDAI NORTH AMERICA NOT ONLY RESULTED IN NO HELP IN FINDING OUT WHICH FUSE WOULD DISABLE THE LIGHTS BUT ALSO ASSURED ME THAT HYUNDAI SEEMS TO EXPECT THE LIFE OF SUCH PARTS TO LAST JUST PAST THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION DATE. I DECIDED TO PULL OUT THE RELAY LOCATED UNDER THE DASHBOARD WHICH TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS (AMONG OTHER THINGS).

I USUALLY GET ALL MY SERVICE DONE THERE.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. HE TOLD ME THAT FIRST I'D HAVE TO GET A DIAGNOSIS ($79+ TAX), THEN ANY REPAIRS ( ANYWHERE FROM $300 TO 1500.) WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY. I ALSO ASKED IF THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON, DOES THE AIRBAG NOT WORK AND WAS TOLD YES.    I JUST WENT TO NHTSA TODAY AND LOOKED IN THE COMPLAINT SECTION FOR THIS VEHICLE AND FOUND NUMEROUS PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE. REQUIRING AIRBAGS IN VEHICLES IS A FEDERAL LAW REQUIREMENT, SO WHY THEN IF THESE SYSTEMS FAIL WITHOUT ANY OWNERS NEGLIGENCE, ARE THE MANUFACTURERS NOT REQUIRED TO SEE THAT THEY GET REPAIRED?

THE LAST TIME I BROUGHT IT IN TO SERVICE, IN JULY 2012- I WAS TOLD THAT MY PASSENGER SEAT MAY NEED TO BE SENT OUT, BUT THAT I WOULD ALSO NEED 2 NEW SEAT BELTS. I WAS TOLD THE AIR BAGS WOULDN'T DEPLOY IF I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO TURN THE DUMMY LIGHT OFF BUT ONLY FOR A DAY OR TWO. THIS NOVEMBER 2013, THE SEAT WAS SENT OUT TO CA UNDER A RECALL NOTICE I WAS SENT BY HYUNDAI, AND I PAID TO HAVE MY SEAT BELTS REPLACED, BUT I FEEL THE WHOLE THING IS RELATED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL. EVERYONE I HAVE SPOKEN TO ABOUT IT FEELS THE SAME WAY. THE SEAT BELT REPLACEMENT COST $350 PER SEAT EXCLUDING TAX. HYUNDAI HAS KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM (THROUGH MY DEALER) SINCE JULY 2012 AND THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN ONGOING FOR MONTHS PRIOR TO ME TAKING IT IN FOR SERVICING, NOT REALIZING IT WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I MISSED THE 5 YEAR 60K WARRANTY PROBABLY BY 10K MILES OR LESS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY OTHER SONATA OWNERS HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THEIR SEAT BELTS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE SUING HYUNDAI TO HAVE THEM COVER THIS \"REPAIR\". I COULD GET NO STATISTICS FROM HYUNDAI WHEN I CALLED THEM REGARDING HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THE EXPLANATION PROVIDED TO ME IS THAT THEY ARE SEPARATE PROBLEMS, NOT INTER-RELATED AND THAT THE SEAT BELT ISSUE IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE AND THE SERVICE CENTER WAS GIVEN A CODE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE.  *TR",

THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT DUE TO AN ACCIDENT THE IMPACT JARS THE SEAT CONNECTION AND CAUSES CODES AND THAT THE LIGHT WILL STILL ILLUMINATE WHEN IT CAME BACK AND IT IS. HE SAID I HAVE TO PAY SOME $600.00 TO GET SOMETHING REPAIRED AND THE ATTORNEY ADVISED AGAINST ME PAYING THAT IS NOT MY FAULT.

THE ATTORNEY ALSO STATED THAT THE CAR IS UNDER RECALL AND IF THE LIGHT IS ON WHATEVER THEY SAY DOESN'T MATTER THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER ME SOMETHING UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AND THEY ARE NOT.

I STOPPED AND SAW A LARGE RUSTY METAL PIECE HAD DETACHED FROM THE FRAME ON THAT SIDE AND WAS DRAGGING ON THE ROAD, THE WHEEL WAS TIPPED OUT WOBBLY. I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN. I CALLED AAA AND HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL GARAGE. DUE TO HOLIDAY WEEKEND, MY HUSBAND SAW THE MECHANIC ON MONDAY 7/8/13, WHO DIAGNOSED IT AS A REAR SUBFRAME CORROSION AND FAILURE. HE ADVISED US TO CHECK FOR A RECALL AS HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH A PRIOR FRONT FRAME RECALL A FEW YEARS AGO. HE HAD OTHER REPAIRS AHEAD OF US, SO WE HAD IT TOWED TO OUR MECHANIC 15 MILES AWAY. WHEN OUR MECHANIC GOT IT ON THE LIFT WE WERE TOLD THE DAMAGE WAS VERY SEVERE: THE REAR END WAS ROTTED, NEEDING REMOVAL/REPLACEMENT OF REAR CROSSMEMBER, 2 UPPER AND 2 LOWER ARMS, L/R UPPER CONTROL ARM AND JOINT, WITH REAR SHOCKS AND MOUNTS, AND ALIGNMENT.WE CALLED HYUNDAI REGIONAL OFFICE, OPENED CASE # 5870260.

HE ADVISED CONTACTING THE DEALERSHIP, AS THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING. (HERB CHAMBERS OF AUBURN, MA.) THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED US TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THEM AT OUR EXPENSE (40MI.) HIS LACK OF EMPATHY AND TELLING US THAT HYUNDAI WOULD TAKE LITTLE OR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRS, OUTSIDE OF A RECALL, PROMPTED US TO HAVE OUR MECHANIC DO THE WORK.

I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER IN 2010, WHO CHARGED ME $100 INSPECTION FEE. HE CONCLUDED THAT THE LIGHT WAS ON AS A RESULT OF A SEAT MALFUNCTION BUT TOLD US NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THE LIGHT. IN JUNE 2013, WE WERE ON A TRIP TO THE EAST COAST AND NEEDED AXLE WORK (WHICH WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY AT 85,000 MILES) AND I AGAIN ASKED THAT DEALER TO CHECK THE SEAT BELT LIGHT. HE INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH SOME BOLTS IN THE SEAT BELT RESTRAINTS AND THAT MY AIR BAGS WERE NOT FUNCTIONAL AS LONG AS THE LIGHT WAS ON. EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED THE EXTENDED DEALER WARRANT FOR THIS VEHICLE, I WAS AGAIN CHARGED FOR THE INSPECTION AND NEITHER THE MANUFACTURER OR WARRANTY COMPANY WILL STEP UP TO COVER THIS REPAIR.

HER CAR  HAD 29,340 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME THEY WERE INSTALLED BY PARAMUS HYUNDAI ROUTE4 EAST PARAMUS,NJ. HER CAR AT THE PRESENT TIME HAS 47,990 MILES ON IT,WHICH MEANS THAT SHE HAD ONLY DRIVEN HER CAR WITH THESE TIRES FOR 18,650 MILES. I NOTICED THAT THEIR WAS A WEAK SPOT \"BUBBLE\" ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE RIGHT REAR TIRE. I HAD MY WIFE TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE WE PURCHASED THE TIRES. THE SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED HER THAT THREE OUT OF THE FOUR TIRES HAD WEAK SPOTS AND BUBBLES ON THE SIDE WALLS OF THE TIRES AND THAT GENERAL TIRES HAD DISCONTINUED  THE EXCLAIMS BRAND AND THAT SHE MUST REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES. I THEN NOTIFIED GENERAL TIRES BY EMAIL ON 05/18/2013,AND TOLD THEM OF THE PROBLEM,AND THAT I HAD REGISTERED THE TIRES ON THEIR WEBSITE AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED US OF THE PROBLEM. MY WIFE COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR EVEN KILLED DRIVING HER CAR WITH THREE OUT OF THE FOUR TIRES WITH \"DEFECTS\". THEY INSISTED THAT THE WEAK SPOTS AND BUBBLES ON THE SIDEWALLS WERE CAUSED BY \"ROAD HAZARDS\" WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM OR CHECKING THEM. I WOULD AGREE IF THE DEFECTS WERE ONLY TWO TIRES AND BOTH ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR BUT I DO NOT AGREE WHEN IT ENTAILS THREE TIRES. RIGHT FRONT,LEFT FRONT,RIGHT REAR. THE PERSON AT GENERAL TIRE TOLD ME TO TAKE THE CAR TO A CONTINENTAL DEALER AND HAVE THEM INSPECT THE TIRES WHICH I DID. THE PERSON THAT LOOKED AT THE TIRES DID NOT PUT THE CAR ON A LIFT HE WALKED OUTSIDE AND LOOKED AT THE TIRES IN A PARKING SPACE. HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS A DEFECT BUT A \"DESIGN ERROR\" THAT CAUSED THE WEAK SPOTS AND BUBBLES AND THATS WHY THE TIRES WERE DISCONTINUED. IF THAT'S THE REASON THEN GENERAL TIRES SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE TIRES AND NOTIFIED US OF THE PROBLEM. THE D.O.T. NO.S PS403R7,S403RY3S10,S403RY3710, PS403RY, WOULD NOT FIT IN SPACE PROVIDED ON FORM.

I HAD TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND RESTART IT 3 TIMES BEFORE THE ESC OFF LIGHT WENT OFF AND I AGAIN HAD ACCELERATION. THEN ABOUT 20 MILES OUTSIDE OF METAIRIE, LA. WHERE I WAS HEADING, IT STARTED SPUTTERING. THE RPMS WOULD GO DOWN AND THE CAR WOULD PULL BACK, THEN THEY WOULD JUMP UP AND THE CAR WOULD JERK FORWARD. I FINALLY MADE IT TO MY DESTINATION WHAT IS NORMALLY A 4 1/2 HR DRIVE TURNED IN TO A VERY STRESSFUL AND FEARFUL 8 HR DRIVE. I DID LOOK UP ON GOOGLE ABOUT 2006 SONATA'S AND ESC OFF LIGHT AND FOUND MANY OFF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I AM PUTTING THE CAR IN THE SHOP TOMORROW MORNING. I READ OF A WOMAN HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND HER CAR ACCELERATING ON HER AND PLUNGED INTO A TREE. THIS SOUNDS TO ME A SERIOUS MATTER AND SEEMS IT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO FIX WHEN IT SEEMS TO BE A MANUFACTURES DEFECT AND SHOULD BE FIXED BY HYUNDAI. *TR",

I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK I'VE MISUSED THE VISOR - I DON'T EVEN USE IT THAT MUCH - SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF MISHANDLING.  WITH AS MANY COMPLAINTS AS I SAW ON-LINE, I THINK THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT WARRANTS ATTENTION.    THANK YOU. *TR",

I AM DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE WERE I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT THE PASSENGER AIR BAG WILL DEPLOY WHEN IT HAS TOO. WHAT IS HYUNDAI WAITING FOR, A DEATH DUE TO THE ARROGANCE?   NOVEMBER 2009 MAIN AIR BAG INDICATORS COME ON.HYUNDAI DOES DIAGNOSTIC AND TELLS ME SEAT BELT TENSIONER FAILURE. THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR IT, THEY REPLACE SEAT BELT BUCKLES AND TENSIONERS. MAIN AIR BAG PROBLEM CORRECTED BUT PASSENGER AIR BAG STILL INTERMITTENT  PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE  REPAIRS SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY. THE CAR WAS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD WITH 74,353 MILES . IS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE OR A WARRANTY ISSUE?   I PAID FOR THE REPAIRS BUT I NEVER KNOW IF THE AIR BAG SYSTEM WILL WORK PROPERLY.  WHAT RIGHTS DO I HAVE IN THIS MATTER SINCE HYUNDAI IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY? ALSO THERE IS A RECALL ON THE HYUNDAI AZER 2006-2009 FOR FAILURE OF THE SEAT BELT TENSION SENSORS. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I EXPERIENCED IN MY 2006 SONATA. WHO IS TO SAY THAT THEY USED THE SAME PART IN MY VEHICLE?     I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CONTACT ME AND  LET ME KNOW HOW I GET REIMBURSED FOR THE REPAIRS AND GET MY CAR SAVE AGAIN.  *TR",

HE SAID HE GOT THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE OF VARIOUS SIZES TO RIDE IN IT AND THE LIGHT WOULD NOT COME ON  3RD... CALLED THE NATIONAL HYUNDAI HEADQUARTERS....

INSISTED THAT SERVICE PERSON DOCUMENT THE FACT THAT HE SAW THE LIGHT ON.  5: CALLED HYUNDAI NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS AGAIN,  ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR,   SHE ASSURED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE ALLEVIATED  6. SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO BRING THE CAR IN.     WE TOOK THE CAR IN.  HIS SOLUTION WAS TO TAKE A SEAT OUT OF A CAR ON THE NEW CAR LOT AND SWAP IT OUT WITH MY SEAT.   7.

HYUNDAI IS WELL AWARE OF THIS SAFETY PROBLEM AND REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL OR TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM.  A RECALL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ENACTED FOR ANOTHER MODEL BY HYUNDAI WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT IS BAD SENSORS AND IS GOING TO GET SOMEONE KILLED!!!  *NM",

I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE TWO TIMES FOR A PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER AIR BAG SYSTEM, AND TWO TIMES NOW I HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE IS THAT WHEN MY WIFE IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, THE PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF LIGHT REMAINS ON.  IT WORKS PROPERLY WHEN I AM IN THE SEAT.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT  THIS HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY WITH THIS TYPE VEHICLE AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.  THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE RESPONSE AND I WANT THIS DISCREPANCY FIXED.  THE HYUNDAI COMPANY PRIDES ITSELF ON ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES.  IF THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY,  I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD DO ALL YOU CAN TO FIX IT.        AS FOR THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I WILL NOT BE RETURNING IT THERE UNLESS IT IS FOR WARRANTY SERVICE.  THE LAST TIME I HAD IT IN FOR THIS THEY SAID THEY WOULD CALL SOMEONE FOR TECH ASSIST AND GET BACK WITH ME.  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY EVER CONTACTED ANYONE, BUT I KNOW THEY DID NOT CALL BACK.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR I NOTICED UPON FILLING UP THE TANK WITH GAS I COULD HEAR A LOT OF NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR.  IT IS A LOUD SLOSHING OF THE GAS THAT CAN BE HEARD INSIDE THE CAR.  IT SPLASHES BACK AND FORTH UPON STOPPING AND ACCELERATING AND IS LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD OVER THE RADIO.  IT ALSO CREATES SUCH A NOISE THAT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES ON THE LEFT SIDE.  IT SOUNDS AT TIMES AS IF I AM DRAGGING SOMETHING WHEN STOPPING.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER A COUPLE OF TIMES INQUIRING ABOUT THIS AND HAVE GOTTEN NO HELP.  ON OCTOBER 16, 2006 I BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO HYUNDAI TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM INSPECTED, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAD SUPER SENSITIVE HEARING AND THAT IT IS A AND I QUOTE \"A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE\" AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.  I FEEL THAT I PURCHASED A NEW CAR AND I SHOULD NOT HEAR A PEEP OUT OF IT.  THIS GREATLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THE CAR AND I AM NOT SURE HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS WHEN I AM GETTING NOWHERE WITH HYUNDAI MYSELF.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED SAFETY WISE DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS DEALING WITH FUEL.  ALTHOUGH THE NOISE STOPS WHEN THE TANK FALLS BELOW 1/2 I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO FILL MY GAS TANK UP FOR FEAR OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG.  I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME.  THANK YOU.  *NM",
