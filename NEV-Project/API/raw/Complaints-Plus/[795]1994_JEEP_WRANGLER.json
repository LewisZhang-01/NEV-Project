CHRYSLER'S ANSWERS WHEN I COMPLAINED WERE - I USED EXCESSIVE FORCE ALL THE TIME.  THE DRIVERS SEAT BROKE - FIRST TIME I RECLINDED IT.

HOW IS THAT GOING TO HOLD ANYONE IN CASE OF REAR IMPACT OR RECLINING THE SEAT WITHOUT BREAKING??  SAME WITH THE PLASTIC PARTS FOR THE WINDOW ROLLER (EASILY BREAKABLE) AND WHO DESIGNED THE STUPID PART (BAR AND PIN) FOR THE DOOR LOCKS.
