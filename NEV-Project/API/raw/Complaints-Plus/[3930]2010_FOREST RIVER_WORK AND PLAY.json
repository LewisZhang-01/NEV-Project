        "summary": "CASE #[XXX], SUBMITTED 8-17-2010. 2010 FOREST RIVER INC, CHEROKEE GREY WOLF MODEL 19RR. U BOLTS CAME LOOSE ON BOTH AXLES ALLOWING AXLES TO MOVE OFF OF THEIR LOCATING PIN ON LEAF SPRINGS. THE WHEELS SHIFTED RIGHT ALLOWING BOTH RIGHT TIRES TO RUB ON INNER WHEEL WELL. THE CONDITION WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE CAMPER WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER FOR UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR AND CRACKING IN THE TIRE THREADS. THE CAMPER  PURCHASED NEW ON MAY 15, 2010 AND THE CONDITION NOTED ON AUG.4, 2010 WHILE EXAMINING THE TIRES. THE DEALER HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND FILED WARRANTY CLAIMS WITH BOTH FOREST RIVER INC. AND LIPPERT COMPONENTS INC. THE AXEL ASSEMBLY MANUFACTURER. BOTH HAVE BEEN UNRESPONSIVE TO DATE. THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH FOREST RIVER CAMPERS. I SHARED THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ODI REPORTS 10284710, 10225758 AND 10284602 WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER MAX YOUNG, WHO CONFIRMED UPON READING THE REPORTS, THAT THIS IS THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. HE SAID LIPPERT COMPONENTS SUPPLIES THE AXLES AS SUBASSEMBLIES, WITH THE U BOLTS ALREADY INSTALLED TO FOREST RIVER. THEREFORE FOREST RIVER DOES NOT WANT TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE U- BOLTS ARE EITHER OVERLOADED OR MATERIALLY DEFECTIVE FOR THE INSTALLATION AND APPEAR TO BE STRETCHING AND ALLOWING THE NUTS TO ROTATE. THE RESULT IS THEN THE AXLES SHIFT OUT OF POSITION. THIS CAMPER HAS APPROX. 5500 MILES OF USE IN THE 4 MONTHS OWNED. IT WAS GENTLY TOWED AND NOT ABUSED. *TR",
