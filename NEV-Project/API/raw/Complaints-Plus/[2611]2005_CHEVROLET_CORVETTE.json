MAY OF 2014, A GM RECALL # 13146 WAS ASSIGNED TO THE PROBLEM WITH A COMMITMENT FROM GM THAT THE UNDERHOOD BUSSING ELECTRIC CENTER (UBEC) WOULD BE MODIFIED FOR VEHICLE OWNERS AT NO COST (SEE NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 14V251000).  I HAVE CONTACTED CHEVROLET A FEW TIMES SINCE THEN, THE LAST CONTACT BEING YESTERDAY (10/29/14).  I WAS ISSUED A CASE NUMBER BY CHEVROLET/GM (NOT INCLUDED IN THIS DESCRIPTION AS IT COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL INFORMATION).  DESPITE BEING AWARE OF THE NEED TO CORRECT THIS SAFETY ISSUE, I WAS INFORMED 10/29/14 THAT CHEVROLET/GM STILL HAS NOT PROVIDED THE RE-WORKED UBEC FOR REPLACEMENT.  LACK OF LOW-BEAMS IS A REAL PROBLEM AS I AM UNABLE TO KNOWINGLY DRIVE AT NIGHT DUE TO LACK OF SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION WHEN USING ONLY THE FOG LIGHTS, OR OVER-ILLUMINATION USING JUST THE HIGH BEAMS (THIS CAUSES OTHER VEHICLES TO \"FLASH\" ME TO LET ME KNOW MY BRIGHTS ARE ON).  OCCASIONALLY, I WILL BE CAUGHT AFTER SUNDOWN AND FORCED TO DRIVE WITH EITHER ONLY FOG LIGHTS OR HIGH BEAMS.  I AM FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED BY GM'S LACK OF MOVEMENT ON CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM, WHICH IS WHY I AM CONTACTING THE NHTSA.  *TR",

I DO NOT WANT TO TAMPER WITH MY CAR, BECAUSE IF IT WAS NOT CORRECTED I WOULD NEED PROOF, IS THERE SOMEWHERE I CAN GO TO SEE IF THIS SB WAS IN FACT COMPLETED? GM SAID TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER, I CALLED THE DEALER, BUT THEY WE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS LIKE THIS, SO I SURE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THEM, JUST TO HAVE THEM CHARGE $ ME FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALREADY, OR IF IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. CAN YOU HELP, BECAUSE I CAN NOT PUT THE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD, AND TAKE THE CHANCE OF HURTING SOMEONE!!    *JS",

PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  I HAVE NUMEROUS EMAILS FROM GM ON THE SUBJECT.     [XXX]  I AM SORRY THAT IT HAS TAKEN ME SOMETIME TO GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR AIR BAG LIGHT, I HAD TO SPEAK WITH INTERNAL RESOURCES.     THE AIR BAG LIGHT CONCERN IS CAUSED BY THE SEAT BELT CONNECTOR UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT COMING LOOSE.  THERE WAS A CHANGE MADE IN 2008 THAT MOVED THE CONNECTOR THAT HELPS SOME BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY REMEDY IT.  IT CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN FEWER NUMBERS IN 2008 ? 2010.   IT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CONNECTOR BEING PLACED DIRECTLY UNDER THE SEAT CUSHION.  WHEN A CUSTOMER USES EASY EXIT OR MEMORY SO THE SEAT MOVES AT EACH DOOR OPENING IT WILL WORK THE CONNECTOR LOOSE OVER TIME. THE FIX WAS TO ATTACH IT TO THE SEAT FRAME SO IT DID NOT GET DRUG ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CARPET.  IN 2008 THEY MADE THE WIRE A LITTLE LONGER TO MOVE THE CONNECTOR OUT OF THE WAY.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DISCUSSION FOR A RECALL OR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ACTION BECAUSE IT WAS SELF-DECLARING.      I AM SORRY THIS IS NOT THE RESOLUTION THAT YOU WISHED FOR ON THIS MATTER. I DID LOOK INTO THE CONCERN AND I DID SPEAK WITH THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENTS. I AM SORRY TO BE THE ONE TO BRING YOU THIS NEWS. I DO THANK YOU FOR BEING DILIGENT IN REACHING OUT TO ME.

THE CHECK AIR BAG LIGHT GOES OFF AND ON AT RANDOM.  WE KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING IT BUT GM WILL NOT FIX IT.  I JUST RECEIVED THE LETTER BELOW FROM GM EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM AND WHAT IS CAUSING IT.  THEY ADMIT THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT HAVE NO PLANS ON CORRECTING IT.  THOUSANDS OF CORVETTE FORUM MEMBERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS.  WE HAVE COME UP WITH OUR OWN TEMPORARY FIX UNTIL GM REDESIGNS THE DEFECTIVE (BAD DESIGN) CONNECTOR UNDER THE SEAT.  WE ZIP TIE IT TOGETHER. MANY MEMBERS DRIVE WITH THE LIGHT ON ALL THE TIME.  GM WILL NOT TELL US IF THE BAG WILL DEPLOY WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON.  I'M SURE IT WONT.  ARE WE GOING TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BE KILLED TO FIX IT?  I HOPE NOT.        LETTER FROM GM  THE AIR BAG LIGHT CONCERN IS CAUSED BY THE SEAT BELT CONNECTOR UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT COMING LOOSE.  THERE WAS A CHANGE MADE IN 2008 THAT MOVED THE CONNECTOR THAT HELPS SOME BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY REMEDY IT.  IT CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN FEWER NUMBERS IN 2008 ' 2010.   IT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CONNECTOR BEING PLACED DIRECTLY UNDER THE SEAT CUSHION.  WHEN A CUSTOMER USES EASY EXIT OR MEMORY SO THE SEAT MOVES AT EACH DOOR OPENING IT WILL WORK THE CONNECTOR LOOSE OVER TIME. THE FIX WAS TO ATTACH IT TO THE SEAT FRAME SO IT DID NOT GET DRUG ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CARPET.  IN 2008 THEY MADE THE WIRE A LITTLE LONGER TO MOVE THE CONNECTOR OUT OF THE WAY.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DISCUSSION FOR A RECALL OR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ACTION BECAUSE IT WAS SELF-DECLARING.

I'M A MEMBER OF THE CORVETTE FORUM WITH OVER 25,000 POST AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH MOST IF NOT ALL C6 CORVETTES.  I HAVE COME UP WITH A TEMPORARY FIX.  I INSTALL ZIP TIES AROUND THE CONNECTOR UNDER THE SEAT THAT IS FOR THE PRE-TENSIONER.  THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM FOR AWHILE.  LAST TIME IT WAS ONLY A MONTH BUT OTHER TIMES IT WILL LAST FOR UP TO A YEAR. CHECK OUT MY PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I'VE HAD IT IN THE DEALERS MANY TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE.  THEY EVEN CHARGED ME FOR A PRE-TENSIONER THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM.  THEY KNOW LIKE MY BUDDIES ON THE CORVETTE FORUM KNOW GM NEEDS TO DESIGN AND INSTALL NEW AND IMPROVED CONNECTORS.  WE DON'T KNOW IF THE AIR BAG WILL DEPLOY IF THE LIGHT IS ON.   MOST OF MY BUDDIES USE THE SAME ZIP TIE TRICK.    I HOPE YOUR WILL GIVE THIS ISSUE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION BEFORE YOU IGNORE IT AGAIN.

I AM A MEMBER OF THE CORVETTE FORUM AND IT IS DISCUSSED OFTEN.  MANY DEALERS ACROSS THE US CLAIM THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM.  IN MY CASE IT STARTED SHORTLY AFTER I PURCHASED THE C6.  EVERY TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME TO RETURN WHEN THE LIGHT WAS ON.  THAT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GOES OFF AND ON.  SOMETIMES A WEEK OR MORE GOES BY AND IT'S OKAY.  FINALLY WHEN MY WARRANTY WAS UP BUT I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY I GOT IN WITH THE LIGHT ON AND THEY GOT A CODE.  IT WAS THE DRIVERS SEAT SEATBELT PRE-TENSIONER.    THAT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM AND GM SHUT DOWN DEALERS ACROSS THE US AND MINE WAS ONE OF THEM.  THE MEMBERS ON THE CORVETTE FORUM DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS DEFECTIVE (BAD DESIGN) WIRE CONNECTORS UNDER THE SEAT.  EVERY TIME THE MEMORY SEAT MOVES IN AND OUT IT LOOSENS CONNECTOR.  I CAME UP WITH THE PLAN TO ZIP TIE THE CONNECTOR TOGETHER. NOW OWNER'S ACROSS THE US USE THIS METHOD.  IT WORKS TEMPORARILY.  SOMETIMES FOR A YEAR OR MORE BUT NOW THAT MY AND OTHERS CORVETTES HAVE A FEW MILES ON THEM THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE.  I HAVE TO REPLACE AND ENLARGE THE ZIP TIES MORE OFTEN.

AFTER SOME CONFUSION, THE FOG LIGHTS WERE TURNED ON.  THE INITIAL TUNNEL ENTRANCE FROM FULL DAYLIGHT TO DARKNESS WAS PROBLEMATIC FOR ASCERTAINING THE SIDES OF  THE ROADWAY.  HIGH BEAMS WERE NOT ADVISABLE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR BLINDING THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS ARE STRONGLY SAFETY ORIENTED DUE TO THE DRIVER DEPENDENCE AND CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEMS.  THE COMPLETE AND RANDOM FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM AND RESULTANT FAILURE OF BOTH HEADLIGHTS AS OPPOSED TO A SINGLE FAILURE EXPECTED OF A MANUAL SYSTEM PUTS THE DRIVER AND ADJACENT TRAVELERS IN A DANGEROUS AND UNEXPECTED SITUATION.  A SECOND FAILURE WAS EXPERIENCED ABOUT ONE WEEK LATER ON EXITING FROM A WELL LIGHT PARKING AREA ONTO AN URBAN ROADWAY.  AGAIN THE FAILURE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED DUE TO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE DASHBOARD ICON INDICATING THAT THE LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED.  THE LIGHTS OF THE ADJACENT HEAVY TRAFFIC MINIMIZED THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE THE LIGHTING FAILURE BUT CLEARLY THE ADJACENT DRIVERS PERCEPTION OF THE APPROACHING CAR WAS AFFECTED.  ONCE AGAIN, THE REMEDIAL ACTION WAS TO ILLUMINATE THE FOG LIGHTS AFTER CYCLING THE MANUAL CONTROL TO NO EFFECT.  THE NEXT MORNING, THE SYSTEM WAS PERFORMING NORMALLY.  RANDOM FAILURES HAVE A MUCH STRONGER SAFETY IMPACT DUE TO THE UNEXPECTED NATURE OF THE FAILURE.  A TRIVIAL INVESTIGATION ON THE INTERNET REVEALED THAT THIS FAILURE HAS BEEN REPORTED BOTH TO THE NHTSA AND THE MANUFACTURER, CHEVROLET, TO NO EFFECT.  FAILURE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A FUSE BLOCK.  THE FAILURE THEN APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW IN THE PACKAGING OF THE FUSE BLOCK.  *TR",

(UPDATE FROM E-MAIL)   I HAVE HAD THE REPAIR COMPLETED. I WAS TOLD IT WAS A FAULT IN THE STEERING COLUMN (TELESCOPING) AND WOULD BE FIXED WITH A COUPLE OF ZIP TIES, BUT THE PROCESS REQUIRED A LOT TO BE REMOVED AND WHILE I DID IT I SHOULD REPLACE THE TIRE SENSOR AS WELL, AS THAT COULD BE PART OF THE ISSUE.    I HAD THE REPAIR DONE OUT OF FEAR THAT IF I DIDN'T , IT WOULD ENDANGER MY FAMILY.  WHEN THE BRAKES SELF APPLIED, THE STEERING WOULD PULL HARD TO THE LEFT. THEY WOULD REMAIN THAT WAY UNTIL I EITHER TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF OR HELD DOWN THE TRACTION CONTROL BUTTON FOR SEVEN SECONDS WHICH TURNS OFF TRACTION CONTROL AND ACTIVE HANDLING. IF THIS WASN'T DONE, AND ANY GAS WAS APPLIED, THE BRAKES WOULD LOCK HARDER, PULSING OFF AND ON INTERMITTENTLY.  THE PULL WAS DRASTIC ENOUGH TO HAVE PULLED ABOUT TEN DEGREES OFF OF CENTER-LINE, BUT SINCE IT HAPPENED AT LOW SPEEDS, IT DID NOT CAUSE ANY ACCIDENTS. MY CONCERN WAS, THE FEW TIMES IT HAPPENED WHILE OTHER DRIVERS WERE FOLLOWING... ALMOST HAD SOME REAR END COLLISIONS.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED FOR TWO WEEKS NOW, AND HAVE HAD NO SIGN OF IT REPEATING.

LATER I SAW THAT THE CAR WAS DISPLAYING A FRONT RIGHT TIRE PRESSURE OF 0 PSI, BUT NO OTHER WARNINGS OCCURRED (TYPICALLY, A YELLOW WARNING LIGHT GOES ON AN CAR DISPLAYS A LOW TIRE PRESSURE OR RIGHT FRONT TIRE FLAT WARNING WHEN THIS OCCURS).  I'VE HAD ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM AND CHEVY HAS ATTEMPTED REPAIR ONCE.  USUALLY ONE OF THE FRONT TIRES WILL READ ZERO PSI AND THE AFOREMENTIONED WARNINGS WILL APPEAR, AND THE CAR'S ACTIVE HANDLING SYSTEM WILL ENGAGE MORE EASILY, THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER, THE CAR WILL DISPLAY NORMAL TIRE PRESSURES AGAIN.  IN THE INCIDENT I'M DESCRIBING HERE, THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS BEING READ AT ZERO, AND NO INDICATION THAT ACTIVE HANDLING WOULD ENGAGE SO EASILY.  THIS IS A DEFINITE SAFETY HAZARD THAT COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF CONTROL OR A CRASH.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THE CAR SERVICED IN TWO DAYS. *TR",

A FRICTION WASHER WAS ADDED BEHIND THE CRANK PULLEY ON THE ADVICE OF GM TECH SUPPORT.  *CAR BROKE DOWN AGAIN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM ON 13 NOVEMBER. CAR IS NOW AT RADLEY CHEVROLET IN FREDERICKSBURG, VA. GM HAS ORDERED THE MOTOR REPLACED AND THE DEALER IS AWAITING PARTS. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED FAILURE, THERE ARE OTHER LS2 ENGINES BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE OF THIS CRANK PULLEY PROBLEM.*AK",
