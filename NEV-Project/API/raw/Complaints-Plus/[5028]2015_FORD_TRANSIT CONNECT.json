The lack of a functioning backup camera results in the loss of a view directly behind the vehicle which could result in an accident. A warning stating that \"rear view camera is unavailable\" and a dark display occur when the fuse is blown. The rearview camera fuse blows often typically only after a few vehicle trips. After diagnosing the blown fuse issue, chafing of a wiring harness was found behind a grommet where wires pass between the vehicle body and the rear liftgate.  The damaged wiring harness is in the vehicle and available for inspection. This issue has also been documented by others as was discovered by searching for information on the internet.",

SEVERAL ISSUES AROSE FROM THAT: FIRST, I HAVE BEEN SMELLING CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE CAB FOR QUITE A WHILE AND DID  NOT KNOW WHY (NOW I THINK I KNOW - CLOGGED CATALYTIC, REVERSION THROUGH THE ENGINE BAY). SECOND THE CATALYTIC WARRANTY EXPIRES AT 80,000 MILES. (THE LIGHT WENT ON AT 81,000). THIRD, AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, THE DEALER FINANCE GUY FORCED ME TO BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. HE SAID THAT FORD WOULD NOT FINANCE ME IF I DID NOT BUY IT SO I AGREED. IT WAS OVER $2000 TAKEN OUT OF MY DOWN PAYMENT. I FULLY EXPECTED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY TO COVER THE BROKEN CAT - WRONG - CATS ARE NOT COVERED. THE REPAIR WAS QUOTED AT ABOUT $1000. MY BEEF HERE IS SEVERAL FOLD: THE 1) FORD WARRANTY EXPIRES AT 80,000 AND THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AT 81,000 EVEN THOUGH THE CONVERTER HAD BEEN GOING BAD THE WHOLE TIME. 2) I HAVE BEEN BREATHING CO2 IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. 3) THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WAS USELESS AND I PAID A HEFTY SUM FOR IT. THE REPAIR IS QUITE EXPENSIVE AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT COVERED BY ANY OF THE WARRANTIES I HAVE, WHICH I THINK IS UNFAIR. I HAVE NOT BROUGHT THIS COMPLAINT TO THE DEALER TO ALLOW THEM A REBUTTAL - I SIMPLY LEFT IN SHOCK THAT I AM ON THE HOOK, AND NOW I'M BREATHING THE STINK OF A DECOMPOSING CAT IF I DON'T USE RECIRCULATE (AND A SLIGHT AMOUNT EVEN IF I DO USE RECIRCULATE, WHICH IS ANOTHER COMPLAINT - RECIRCULATE STILL LETS IN OUTSIDE AIR.
