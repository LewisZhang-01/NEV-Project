Ongoing very common issues with triton engines blowing out spark plugs making a fire hazard because fuel vapor coming out of plug hole could be ignited by coil pack. All ford dealerships are very aware of this issue and have repaired many by rethreading and installing a helicoil thread repair kit at a very high price of 800 dollars and most repairs are temporary because the aluminum is weak and very thin at the spark plug hole. Ford is very aware of this ongoing issue and denies any liability experts don\u2019t agree with fords arguments. No warning the plugs start to blow out at around 140000 miles well after the warranty. This problem started in the 90s all triton engines are affected. As in the photo the dealers attempt to repair was unsuccessful the spark plug is tightened to deep into the head and is broken off. They said at the end of the day I need a new head. 5000 dollars.",

RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSION THE TRUCK LOST POWER AND SOUNDED LIKE AN EXHAUST PIPE HAD FALLEN OFF THE MOTOR. THERE WAS A STRONG SMELL OF GAS AND EXHAUST BUT TRUCK WAS DRIVABLE. BROUGHT TRUCK TO DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT 2 SPARK PLUGS HAS BLOWN OUT AND ONE OF THE TWO HAD TAKEN THE THREADS WITH IT. ADVISED ME THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE AND I HAD TO OPTIONS TO FIX. ONE WAS TO RE-THREAD AND REPLACE ALL SPARK PLUGS FOR $899. SECOND WAS TO REPLACE HEAD AT $2100. TOLD DEALERSHIP TO DO THE LESSER OPTION. HAD TO LEAVE TRUCK THERE AND OBTAIN A ONE WAY RENTAL FOR 5 PEOPLE AT $300. HAVE NOW FOUND OUT THAT ITS NOT RARE AND MAY NOT BE FIXED EVEN AFTER THE REPAIR.

IT WAS LATE SATURDAY BUT AFTER 2-3 HOURS FOUND A TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND LEFT IT THEIR BACK LOT.  I WAS TOLD THE NEXT WEEK THAT FORD WANTED THE ENGINE BACK INTACT.  AFTER AROUND THREE WEEKS AND $800+ FOR A RENTAL I GOT THE TRICK BACK WITH A NEW ENGINE.  2800 MILES LATER, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED.  MY WARRANTY WAS OUT ON TIME BUT FORD DID REPLACE THE ENGINE AGAIN BUT I WAS OUT THE RENTAL CAR--AGAIN $800+.  THIS WAS SOME 6 MONTHS BACK AND ALL IS OK FOR NOW BUT I WAS TOLD IF THE ENGINE BLOWS AGAIN FORD WILL NOT COVER IT.  AND ON THE 2ND REPLACEMENT (3RD TOTAL) ENGINE THAT PISTONS WERE IN THE OIL PAN.  5.4 ENGINE.  *TR",

ORIGINAL TIRES(PIRELLI) WERE SEPARATING. REPLACED TIRES(976.00), MUCH BETTER. STILL HAVE SLIGHT VIBRATION AT HIGHWAY SPEEEDS. FOUND LEFT FRONT HUB BEARING SEEPING GREASE AND FEELS STIFF. AWAITING PARTS TO DO REPAIRS. (98.00) HAD A TRANSMISSION SHUDDER AT LIGHT LOAD IN OVERDRIVE. FLUSHED TRANSMISSION WITH BG PRODUCTS AND FLUSH MACHINE. ADDED NEW TRANS FLUID AND CONDITIONER. TRANSMISSION NOW SHUDDERS AT ALL SPEEDS WHEN HOT. WILL ORDER NEW FILTER AND REPLACE. WILL ADD FRICTION MODIFIER AND TRY AGAIN. HAVE TO TOW ANOTHER VEHICLE THIS WEEKEND AND AM AFRAID TO DO SO. I AM COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY THAT THESE PROBLEMS COULD HAPPEN TO ANY VEHICLE STARTING AT 48,000 MILES. ALL MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN PERFORMED WITH TOP OF THE LINE PRODUCTS. HAVE BEEN A FORD OWNER ALL MY LIFE AND AM COMPLETELY DIS-SATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS SUPPOSED NUMBER ONE SELLING TRUCK. THE STICKER PRICES OF THESE TRUCKS SHOULD BE A BUNCH LESS SINCE CHEAPLY PRODUCED CHINESE PARTS ARE SO PREVALENTLY USED.     NOT HAPPY.  *TR",

AFTER HITTING THE POLE, I WENT DOWN A HILL AND HIT TREES FROM THERE. IT DID MORE DAMAGE TO THE FRONT OF MY TRUCK YET STILL NOTHING FROM THE AIRBAGS. IT WAS ENOUGH FORCE TO CRUSH THE HOOD, AND THE ENTIRE RIGHT PANEL. THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY AND 1 PERSON WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. FROM WHAT I AM READING, IT TAKE 18-20 LBS OF PRESSURE TO HAVE THEM DEPLOY. IT WAS FOR SURE ENOUGH FORCE TO HAVE THEM DEPLOY AND ACCORDING TO OFFICERS AT THE SCENE, NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY THEY NEVER DEPLOYED? I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET AN ANSWER ON THIS, AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF FORD EVER RECALLED THIS ISSUE?  I ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE ACCIDENT. THANK YOU!   *TR",

I COULD NOT STEER AWAY FROM AN 18 WHEELER THAT WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE.  I BOUNCED OFF THE 18 WHEELER AND IT KNOCKED MY WHEEL STRAIGHT.  I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF MY TRUCK. I HAD $5000 IN PROPERTY DAMAGE . THE 18 WHEELER DID GO OFF THE ROAD AND HAD $70000 WORTH OF DAMAGE.    THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PICKING MY TRUCK UP FROM THE BODYSHOP I HAD ANOTHER BLOWOUT ON THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE. THIS TIME I WAS GOING 35 MPH AND WAS ABLE TO CONTROL MY TRUCK.  THE BACK TIRES WERE FINE.  THESE 2 BLOWOUTS OCCURRED WITHIN 1. 5 HOURS OF DRIVING ALL IN THE FRONT.  TIRES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE EXCESS WEIGHT OF A F150 SUPERCREW.
