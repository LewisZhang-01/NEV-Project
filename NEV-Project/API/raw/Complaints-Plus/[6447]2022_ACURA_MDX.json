        "summary": "Observation 1: Lane-keeping assistance is unreliable and the results of its operation are highly variable.  In optimum conditions (daylight, wide lanes which are clearly marked; good contract between lane markings & pavement; no more than very gentle, wide-radius curves), this feature will do one of three things when the vehicle starts to drift from the middle of the lane:   (1) the feature will gently steer the vehicle back to the desired position,  (2) the feature will exhibit a warning by vibrating the steering wheel and allow the vehicle to change lanes or  (3) fail and do nothing -- without any warning whatsoever.   One never knows how the car will react but it certainly cannot be trusted.  Observation 2: When driving in light traffic or no traffic conditions the vehicle will occasionally brake aggressively.   This was observed to occur on multiple occasions.  Two situational examples which have been observed several times:   (1) four lane roadway inside city limits; speed: 40mph; I was gently braking to stop behind a vehicle stopped at a traffic light; car applied brakes rapidly nearly causing a rear-end crash as the vehicle behind me did not anticipate the Acura's action.  (Judging from the hand signal I received I believe the driver of the vehicle behind me though I was administering a \"brake test\" -- a common precursor to \"road rage.\") (2) driving on a two lane country road at 50-55MPH; no other traffic within hundreds of feet in any direction;  vehicle brakes rapidly for no apparent reason;  my attempt to accelerate and over-ride the \"safety feature\" was unsuccessful -- eventually the Acura stopped this action and I was able to resume desired speed. Important to note:  At no time during these incidents did braking occur to avoid a crash or minimize damage.  These were uncommanded operations that actually increased the probability of a crash.   These events occurred between 11/21 and 03/22.",

One in the right land and one passing the other in the center lane. The trooper and I pulled into the left lane. As we approached the waste disposal trucks (about 1/8 mile away) my brakes automatically engaged and braked hard for no reason. I tried to override it by depressing the accelerator but the accelerator did not respond (as though it had been disengaged). Behind me was a Mercedes SUV, which had to brake hard to avoid rear ending me. My brakes kept automatically braking (off and on). I finally pulled off the road on the left shoulder and brought the car to a complete stop. It then allowed me to proceed on my way. I bought the car in part for this safety feature, but it clearly is faulty. In reading about braking system, i found that older models had a button that you could use to turn the system off. In my 2022 model, you can turn it off only with multiple steps. You can also adjust the responsiveness of the auto-brake system through a multiple step process. Clearly, this is a major problem that needs to be addressed. I was very lucky that the car behind me braked immediately or it would have rear-ended me at high speed. It was about 5:30 p.m. It was getting dark but not completely dark. I think the problem is with the automatic braking system for forward crash avoidance, but my adaptive cruise control was engaged.",
