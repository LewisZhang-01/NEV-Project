THE 1ST INCIDENT WAS BRIEF AND CORRECTED QUICKLY BY PUSHING DOWN ON THE PEDAL TO \"FREE IT\",  THE 2ND INCIDENT REQUIRED BRAKING AND PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND SHOVING THE PEDAL WITH MY FOOT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT TO FREE IT UP.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR TO THE SHOULDER, TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN THE PEDAL SEEMED TO WORK OK,  ALTHOUGH A BIT SLUGGISH RESPONSE.  OUR MECHANIC FIXED THE THROTTLE BODY AND THE CAR HAS NOT HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT UNTIL LAST WEEK.  THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT WAS MORE HARROWING IN THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH ROOM TO MANEUVER THE CAR SINCE WE WERE HEADED FOR LOTS OF CARS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT.  I TRIED TO SLOW THE CAR BY BRAKING HARD WITH THE LEFT FOOT AND SHOVING THE ACCELERATOR. PEDAL DOWN AND SIDE TO SIDE WHILE IN NEUTRAL BUT THIS DID NOT WORK QUICKLY LIKE THE OCTOBER INCIDENT.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO A SHOULDER BEFORE CRASHING BUT IT TOOK MUCH LONGER FOR THE CAR TO STOP THIS TIME, AND I ACTUALLY THREW THE CAR IN PARK TO STOP THE CAR!  I TURNED OFF THE CAR  AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES, WAS COMPOSED ENOUGH TO DRIVE IT.  OUR DEALER WILL CHECK THE CAR JAN 29.   THE FLOOR MAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED JAMMING INTO THE PEDAL, SO IT IS PROBABLY A MECHANICAL \"CATCH\" THAT IS GETTING HUNG UP WHEN THE PEDAL IS DOWN A CERTAIN DISTANCE.

I COULD NOT LET GO OF MY STEERING WHEEL FOR EVEN A SECOND OR THIS VEHICLE WOULD PULL.  I TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP (NEILL SANDLER IN MURFREESBORO, TN) AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I TOOK IT ANOTHER DEALER AND THE LADY WORKING THERE JUST ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN MY HEAD.  LATER I TRIED TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM AND THEY WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE IT SINCE I HAD TAKEN IT TO THE OTHER DEALERSHIP - WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE PROBLEM.  RIGHT BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED, IN 2002, MY HUSBAND TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER AND THE LADY THERE STILL ACTED LIKE WE WERE CRAZY.  LUCKILY, THE SERVICE MANAGER OVERHEARD OUR CONVERSATION AND OFFERED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  AFTER RETURNING FROM HIS DRIVE, HE STATED THAT IT WAS THE WORSE DRIVEN VEHICLE HE HAD EVER BEEN IN.  THEY ENDED UP BENDING THE FRAME AS THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE \"SOLVED\" ANY OTHER WAY AND HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT AFTER BUYING NEW TIRES IT WOULD BE BETTER, AND IT WAS, FOR A WHILE.  SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH IT, AND HAVE PURCHASED AT LEAST THREE SETS OF FRONT TIRES FOR THE VEHICLE.  IT CONTINUES TO PULL AND WE JUST THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH MENTIONING AFTER SEEING YOUR WEBSITE.  *JB",

PROBLEM REPORTED: THE SIENNA TRANSMISSION IS DEFINATELY A PROBLEM IN OUR CASE AS MENTIONED BY TOYOTA DEALER AND MANY OTHER OWNERS AT OR NEAR 60K MILES. THIS IS UNCALLED FOR OF A TOYOTA FOR WHICH WE PAY A PREMIUM. I DODNOT SEE ANY RECALLS AND DEALERSHIP CHARGES MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR LABOU - IN OUR CASE UPTO $3200.  DETAILS : WE CURRENTLY HAVE A 1999 (5/1999) SIENNA VAN XLE WITH 60600 MILES. THE VAN HAS BEEN PROBLEM FREE UNTIL 2 WEEKS AGO ON THE HIGHWAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THE DEALERSHIP'S INITIAL THE DIAGNOSIS INDICATED CELLULOID FAILURE, THEN WE WERE TOLD TORQUE FAILURE AND THEN YESTERDAY THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF. AND WE WERE CHARGED AT EACH - EVEN THOUGH DEALERSHIP PROBABLY KNEW IT IS TRANSMISSION THAT REQUIRES REPLACEMENT. THIS WAS SHOCKING AS  IT IS JUST 600 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY.FURTHER RESEARCH OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND VARIOUS FORUMS   AS WELL AS CARTRACKERS.COM IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE MANY OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED IDENTICAL PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR 60K MILES SOME EVEN EARLIER. I HAD BEEN MAINTAINING THE VAN THRU THE SAME DEALERSHIP (E.G. 15K,30K SERVICE ETC.) AND I DONOT TOW BOATS ETC. SO THERE IS NO ABUSE AS CLAIMED OCCASIONALLY. I THINK THERE IS A REAL ISSUE HERE WITH THE TRANSMISSION.     HOW COME SO MANY HAVE THE IDENTICAL ISSUES AT OR NEAR 60K MILES. THRU THE FORUMS I GATHERED THAT FEW CASES WERE REPORTED AT NHTSA SITE AS SO MANY CANNOT BE WRONG. THUS I WOULD LIKE JOIN THOSE - WHO HAD SIMILAR ISSUES. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD TAKE THE CHARGE FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF REPLACING THIS OR SHOULD RECALL ALL THE VANS. WE ARE DISAPPOINTED  IN THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION AS WE BELIEVE THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IS EITHER A MANUFACTURING OR DESIGN DEFECT.",

WHEN IT DID, WE BROUGHT IT IN FOR THE 3RD TIME (9/00).  THE MOTOR AND COMPUTER WERE REPLACED.  A MONTH LATER (10/00), THE FIRST AND SECOND SYMPTOM BEGAN APPEARING. THE DEALER SAID IT WAS AN ADJUSTMENT.  A MONTH LATER (11/00), THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCURRED; THE DEALER MADE ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT.  A MONTH LATER (12/00), THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED; THE DEALER MADE ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT. A MONTH LATER (1/01), THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCURRED.

THIS TIME, WE WAITED UNTIL IT GOT SO BAD THE POWER DOOR WOULDN'T CLOSE AT ALL.  3 MONTHS LATER (4/01), THE 3RD OF THE SYMPTOMS OCCURS. THE DEALER PUT ANOTHER NEW MOTOR AND COMPUTER IN THE DOOR.
