The contact had taken the vehicle to several dealers including New Century Honda (1235 S Brand Blvd, Glendale, CA 91204), AutoNation Honda Valencia (23551 Magic Mountain Pkwy, Valencia, CA 91355) and several independent mechanics who replaced the battery; however, the mechanics were unable to determine the cause of the failure. The contact stated that the battery would last for a three to six-month period before the failure would occur again. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. Upon his own investigation, the contact stated that the failure may be linked to the rear driver sliding door after the door failed to open electronically, and could only be opened manually. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.",

TO THE BACK OF THE DOOR SLIGHTLY OPENING  THEN THE  BEEPING INDICATOR IS  CONSTANTLY ON WHILE DRIVING.  THE BATTERY IS BEING DRAINED BECAUSE THE DOORS NEVER CLOSE COMPLETELY.   THE CENTER  ROLLERS ARE CHEAP PLASTIC   WHICH I BELIEVE CAUSES THE GRINDING NOISE. ONCE THEY WEAR OUT IT GETS WORSE.  THESE ARE NOT SOME ISOLATED COMPLAINTS!!  THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHERS WITH EVERY YEAR OF THE ODYSSEY THAT HAVE THESE  ISSUES !! AND NOW I FINALLY SEE A RECALL.  ALL THESES ISSUES HAVE HAPPENED DURING DIFFERENT TIMES.  SOME WHILE STATIONARY. SOME WHILE DRIVING. THE WORST ONE WHERE THE DOOR LITERALLY FELL OFF WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVE WAY. (THANK GOD) I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AND RIGGED MY DOOR BUT IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  WHY WAS THIS NOT RECALLED A LONG TIME AGO?? THERE ARE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS TO IGNORE THIS !!  THE NEWER MODELS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM .   I OWNED AN ACCORD FOR 14 YEARS OVER 300,000 MILES.  THE BEST CAR I EVER HAD.

I SAY, THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER FIXED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, IT SHOULD BE FIXED NOW BECAUSE HONDA NEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM WHILE THE TIME FRAME STILL OBLIGATED THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY STEERING MY VAN, TURNING THE VAN, WITH CHILDREN IN IT, AND SO THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED AND FIXED WHEN HONDA SHOULD HAVE FIXED IT.",

AFTER ALL OF THIS AND THEY SAID IT WAS A SPEED SENSOR THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT IS WHAT IT WAS, SO THAT IS WHAT IT HAS TO BE.  THEY NEVER MAKE MISTAKES.     ON JUNE 22, 2016 GOING UP HILL, AND TRYING TO ACCELERATE TO PICK UP SPEED, THE SPEEDOMETER WOULD NOT MOVE. PUSHING ON THE GAS DID NOTHING. I CONTINUED TO MOVE UNTIL THE HILL BECAME TO STEEP, AND THE CAR JUST STOPPED. STARTING TO ROLL BACKWARDS, I HIT THE BRAKES AND HELD ON FOR DEAL LIFE.  ONCE AGAIN AAA HAD TO TOW MY CAR TO HONDA. WELL, GUESS WHAT THEY SAID THIS TIME. YOU NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. YES, THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID THIS 2ND TIME. AT 140K MILES, I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION, AND IT IS GOING TO COST ME $6,000.  WFT! MY 1997 FORD WINDSTAR IS STILL GOING STRONG WITH 250K MILES.     I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT HONDA, BUT I AM GETTING NOWHERE. NO RETURN CALLS, NO COMMUNICATION NOTHING. I WILL NEVER BUY HONDA ANYTHING AGAIN.   *TR",

MY FUEL GAUGE AND LIGHT WERE NOT INDICATING NO FUEL (WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING THAT THE OFFICER WHO ASSISTED IN PUSHING THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD LOOKED AT).   THE LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOP RAN A DIAGNOSTICS ON THE VEHICLE AND DECIDED THAT ALL THE VEHICLE'S SIX CYLINDERS WERE MIS-FIRING DUE TO LOW FUEL PRESSURE (5PSI) AND THAT I NEEDED A NEW FUEL PUMP.  THE LAST TIME I HAD DRIVEN THE VAN PRIOR TO AUGUST 1, WAS JULY 21, 2015 WHEN I TOOK IT TO HONDA DEALER FOR THE FUEL PUMP FILTER REPLACEMENT (THE VEHICLE HAD 147,504 MILES ON IT LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP).  THE DEALER CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THE REASON WHY THE VEHICLE STOPPED WAS THAT I HAD RUN OUT OF FUEL.  I ASKED HOW THE CYLINDER MISFIRINGS AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THAT CAME ON EARLIER ON AUGUST 1ST WAS RELATED TO AN EMPTY TANK, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT THEY WERE RELATED.  BUT HE SAID HE COULD NOT PROMISE THAT THE VEHICLE WILL NOT STALL AGAIN BECAUSE ALL THE FUEL PUMP PART COULD BE GETTING OLD AND FAILING.  NOW, ABOUT THE FUEL GAUGE THAT \"FAILED\" TO WORK AFTER THE FUEL PUMP RECALL WORK WAS DONE, THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND CLAIMED THAT THEIR TECHNICIAN RECHECKED WHAT HE DID ON JULY 21ST AND FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH IT.   FURTHERMORE, IT APPEARS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 ODYSSEY FUEL PUMP IS DEEPER THAN THE \"FILTER\" REPLACEMENT PATCH THAT HONDA HAS IMPROVISED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

I REQUEST FOR THE RECALL FOR THE SRS LIGHT ON. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OWNERS THINK THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT THEY THINK JUST THE LIGHT IS ON AND KEEP DRIVING. I WAS THINKING THE SAME WAY TOO. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO REQUEST THAT RECALL ASAP FOR THE SRS LIGHT ON SO WE WILL SAVE THE PEOPLE LIFE IN ADVANCE.       THE AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON INTERMITTENTLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

AT THE TIME IT STOPPED WORKING, THE VAN WAS PARKED IN A PARKING LOT. WHEN THE BUTTON WAS PRESSED TO OPEN THE DOOR, THE DOOR REFUSED TO OPEN AND A LIGHT WENT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL \"SLIDE DOOR\". WHEN I CONSULTED THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL, IT SAID TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER. I WAS REALLY SUSPICIOUS WITH THE SUDDEN FAILING OF THE DOOR BECAUSE UP UNTIL THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT, THE DOOR WAS WORKING FINE. THE WAY I OPENED THE DOOR AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS IT WAS IN REMAINED THE SAME FROM WHEN THE ODOMETER READ 99700 UNTIL THE INCIDENT.

IT SEEMS MODEL YEARS 2005-2010 HAVE THESE ELECTRIC SLIDING DOORS PROBLEMS WITHOUT ANY CLEAR INDICATION OF ISSUES BEFOREHAND. MULTIPLE REPORTS HAVE STATED OWNERS TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER ONLY TO HAVE THE DEALER CHARGE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO FAIL DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. I VISITED A FORUM THAT OFFERED A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE SOLUTION STATED TO RESET THE INTERNAL COMPUTER BY PULLING A FUSE LABELED AS \"BACK UP\". I WAS SKEPTICAL OF THIS SOLUTION BECAUSE HONDA WOULDN'T DESIGN A VEHICLE THAT STATES AN ERROR WITH A DOOR UNLESS SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE DOOR, FOR EXAMPLE THE MOTOR. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE SLIDING DOOR FAILED, I GAVE IT A TRY AND RESET THE INTERNAL COMPUTER. I STARTED THE ENGINE BACK UP AND NOTICED IMMEDIATELY THE ERROR WAS GONE WHICH MAKES SENSE SINCE THE COMPUTER WAS RESET. WHEN I PUSHED THE BUTTON TO OPEN THE PASSENGER ELECTRIC DOOR, THE DOOR OPENED NORMALLY WITHOUT ANY HESITATION OF MOVEMENT. I AM NOW VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION.

THE VCM ENGINE CUTS OUT CYLINDERS WHEN THEY ARE NOT NEEDED CAUSING THE ENGINE TO VIBRATE SO A REAR MOTOR MOUNT WAS ADDED TO DECREASE THE VIBRATION. THE MOTOR MOUNT IS AROUND $500 PLUS THE COST OF LABOR TO REPAIR. I DON'T HAVE THE $700 NEEDED TO REPAIR MY VAN SO I WILL BE DOUBLE FISTING THE STEERING WHEEL UNTIL THE REMAINING MOUNTS FAIL CAUSING MY ENGINE TO FALL OUT.

PERHAPS HONDA IS PAYING YOU OFF TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM EXIST. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY HONDA DEALERSHIPS WANTING TO PURCHASE MY VAN. I DO NOT HAVE MY VAN LISTED FOR SELL OR HAVE I THOUGHT ABOUT SELLING IT. HOW IS IT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER? THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT HONDA KNOWS THAT THIS PROBLEM EXIST. IF THEY CAN GET OWNERS SUCH AS MYSELF FOR FALL FOR THERE GAME PLAN. THE DEALER IS GOING TO GET ISSUE FIXED AT NO CHARGE TO THEM. THEN SELL THE VAN FOR MUCH MORE THAN THEY ARE OFFERING ME. EVEN WHEN I TOLD THEM NO! THEY CONTINUED TO CALL ME ASKING IF I WOULD RECONSIDER THE OFFER OF SELLING THE VAN. IS THIS JUST COINCIDENCE OF A COVER UP BY HONDA OR THE DEMAND FOR THESE VANS IS HIGH.

WHY TELL ME BUYING WARRANTY WILL COVER EXPENSIVE ENGINE STUFF BUT CLAIM 800+ IS NOT TOO MUCH? EVEN THE MECHANICS NEAR AND FAR,  (I CALLED THEM), ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS ONLINE SUFFERING MY SAME DILEMMA SAID  THIS ENGINE MOUNT IS SUPER COMMON FOR THE ODYSSEYS TO BREAK. ITS SO HARD TO AFFORD A CAR ANYMORE, BUT PEOPLE ARE WORKING SO HARD TO SAVE AND OTHERS TO FIX THEIR CREDIT JUST TO BARELY AFFORD A USED ONE,BUT  TO PURCHASE A 3000$ WARRANTY THAT IS USELESS IN THIS VERY EXPENSIVE CASE ( 800) JUST FOR 2 OF THE MOUNTS AND RIGHT AWAY.  I BABIED THE CAR. NOW I HAVE TO USE GROCERY MONEY THAT FEEDS MY FAMILY TO TRY AND PAY FOR THIS OBVIOUS FLAW THAT HONDA ALREADY KNEW AND KNOWS ABOUT. PLEASE, I BEG YOU TO READ ONLINE. ONE SIMPLE GOOGLE WILL SHOW I AM NOT ALONE IN THIS ENGINE MOUNT STRUGGLE WITH HONDA.  PLEASE DON'T LET WHAT COULD BE A GREAT CAR COMPANY MAKE THIS TERRIBLE CHOICE REPEATEDLY WHEN EVEN THEIR MECHANICS KNOW IT IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM AND WRONG.

I DISCOVERED TODAY THAT NHTSA  ACTION NUMBER 10016777  AND HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER 204110 WERE ISSUED IN 2005, RELATING TO THIS PROBLEM.  THE HONDA DEALER WAS, OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AWARE OF THE DEFECT EACH TIME I RETURNED TO THEM TO FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY.  I BELIEVE THIS FLAW SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR REPAIR: THERE IS A GENUINE SAFETY HAZARD TO A VEHICLE FULL OF CHILDREN WHEN HAVING TO DRIVE TO A GARAGE WHEN A DOOR REFUSES TO CLOSE.  *TR",

MY VAN WILL LOOSE STEERING AT TIMES WHEN IT IS COLD AND MAKES A LOUD NOISE UNDER THE HOOD.  IN ADDITION, THE STEERING WILL SHAKE WHEN DRIVING AS WELL AS WHEN BRAKING.  I JUST REPLACED THE TIRES WHICH INCLUDED A FRONT-END ALIGNMENT AND TIRE BALANCE.  THE SHIMMY, VIBRATION AND SHAKING BACK/FORTH IS STILL THERE.  THE BRAKES AND ROTORS HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY DEALER AND THEY CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH MY ODYSSEY. THE WATER PUMP STARTED AT 15K MILES AND EACH TIME I TOOK IT BACK THEY DID NOT KNOW THE ISSUE AND CHANGED THE WATER PUMP AT 34K MILES.  THE TIRE SHAKING, VIBRATING AND SHIMMY HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE 55K MILES AND THE VAN NOW HAS 105K.  I AM TIRED OF THE PROBLEM.  IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT I DON'T WAN TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL STARTS TO FAIL.  THIS IS A HONDA AND IS SUPPOSE TO LAST.  HONDA NEEDS TO STAND BEHIND THIS PROBLEM.  AS I SEARCH THE WEB THERE ARE MANY HONDA OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE BUT HONDA WILL NOT DO A RECALL.  HONDA NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  STEERING.  PEOPLE CAN DIE FROM THIS.  IN ADDITION, HONDA NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY WITH THESE PROBLEMS WILL BE PURCHASING ANOTHER VAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND WON'T BUY A HONDA DUE THE LACK OF ATTENTION TO THESE MATTERS.  *TR",

IT HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES. I HAVE WORKED WITH HONDA DEALERS AND HONDA CAR FOR OVER EIGHT MONTHS, FROM JAN 2010 TO AUG 2010 WITHOUT SUCCESS. I THEN WENT TO ANOTHER HONDA DEALER AND FINALLY ABLE TO FIND THE PROBLEM:  THE 2005 ODYSSEY VAN IS THE FIRST MODEL AND YEAR HONDA HAS PUT THE NEW V6 ENGINE WITH THREE CYLINDERS SHUTTING OFF DURING CRUISING SPEED TO SAVE GAS, WHICH MAKES SENSE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS, THE IDLING CYLINDERS BEGIN TO BURN OIL ON THE CYLINDER RINGS. AND THERE IS NO ?LOW OIL? WARNING SENSOR FROM THE CAR, BUT HAS A ?LOW OIL PRESSURE WARNING?. HOWEVER, THE ?LOW OIL PRESSURE? WILL ONLY KICKS ON WITH THE CAR ENGINE STARTS TO STALL. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE MY VAN STAFF FROM HIGHWAY SPEED TO LESS THEN 15 MPH IN A MATTER OF COUPLE SECONDS. IT HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES FROM JANUARY, 2010 TO MAY, 2010. I HAVE ALL THE SERVICE RECORDS AND DESCRIPTIONS. HONDA HAS BEEN DENYING ANY PROBLEM UNTIL THEY LIMITED RELEASE A NEW SOFTWARE IN JANUARY, 2011 TO PERIODICALLY FIRE THE IDLE CYLINDERS TO MINIMIZE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BURN MOTOR OIL. HOWEVER, HONDA HAS NOT DONE A ?RECALL? ON THIS SAFETY ISSUE (THE ENGINE STALLING AT HIGH SPEED WHEN OIL PRESSURE IS TOO LOW DUE TO MOTOR OIL BURNING). THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT HONDA IS RELUCTANT TO CONDUCT SUCH SAFETY RECALL, THEY ARE AFRAID THAT WITH FIRING UP THE IDLED CYLINDERS; THEY MAY FAIL THE EPA MILEAGE CLAIMS. ALL THE POST 2005 V6 WITH ?ECON? MODE TO SAVE GAS MODELS WILL HAVE THIS PROBLEMS ONCE THE CARS ARE DRIVEN, LET SAY OVER 70,000 MILES. IT WILL TAKE A FEW YEARS OF MOTOR OIL BURNING BEFORE THE OIL LEVEL IS LOW ENOUGH TO TRIGGER THE LOW OIL PRESSURE SENSOR AND STALLS THE ENGINE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT.  *TR",

I HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF EVIDENCE ONLINE THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE MOTOR MOUNTS RELATED TO THE ECO MODE (DROPPING FROM 4 TO 3 CYLINDERS TO SAVE FUEL) BEING INSTITUTED IN THE ODYSSEYS IN THE MID-2000'S WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING CHANGE TO THE DESIGN OF THE MOTOR MOUNTS WHICH COULD NOT HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL VIBRATION. HERE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY OTHERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE:  HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/SEARCH?Q=HONDA+ENGINE+MOUNT+DESIGN+FLAW  HTTP://GRASSROOTSMOTORSPORTS.COM/FORUM/OFF-TOPIC-DISCUSSION/HONDA-ODYSSEY-ENGINE-MOUNTS/30508/PAGE1/  HTTP://ACTION.PUBLICBROADCASTING.NET/CARTALK/POSTS/LIST/1560611.PAGE    OUR CAR MAY HAVE NOT SET ON FIRE LIKE A REAR-ENDED PINTO, BUT THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT ADDITIONAL DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED THAT WE'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THIS APPARENT DESIGN FLAW. HONDA SHOULD RECALL ALL MOTOR MOUNTS WITH THIS FLAW AND SHOULD COMPENSATE OWNERS FOR REPAIRS RELATED TO THE APPARENT MOTOR MOUNT DESIGN FLAW IN THE ODYSSEY. *TR",

THE FAULTY TUBING THEY USED IN THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY HAS RUINED THE PUMP OVER THE YEARS.

THE AIR CONDITIONER STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 3 YEARS AND I HAD TO REPLACE THE CONDENSER JUST AT 37,000 MILES.  BETTER YET I WAS TOLD BY HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COVERED BY WARRANTY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT WAS CAUSED BY 'SOME ROAD DEBRIS HITTING THE CONDENSER'.  WHAT IS THE ODD THAT HUNDREDS OF HONDA CUSTOMERS HAVE RUN INTO THE SAME ISSUE (EVIDENCED BY THE DISCUSSION FORUM THREADS ON MANY THAT'S OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET).  HONDA'S OFFICIAL SITE STATES: 'CAUTION: RADIATOR AND CONDENSER FINS ARE VERY THIN AND EASILY DAMAGED.  DO NOT BEND THEM WITH HIGH WATER PRESSURE OR BRUSH'.  SO WHY THEN DID HONDA PUT THE A/C CONDENSER COMPLETELY EXPOSED ON THE FRONT OF A VEHICLE THAT CAN LEGALLY TRAVEL AT SPEEDS UP TO 75 MPH?  OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT HONDA SHOULD HAVE RECALLED, OR AT LEAST INSTALL A PROTECTIVE GRILLE BEFORE CUSTOMERS ARE HIT WITH EXPENSIVE REPAIRS.  2008 AND NEWER HONDA VANS NOW COME WITH STANDARD PROTECTION GUARDS ON THE FRONT BUT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR ALL YOUR LOYALTY CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED A 2007 OR EARLIER ODYSSEY.  AS A REPUTABLE AUTO COMPANY, HONDA SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THIS OUTRIGHT FAULTY DESIGN. *TR",

WHILE THE SUV (MY FATHER-IN-LAW 2005 HONDA ODYSSEY VAN) WAS PARKED, MY 8-YEAR OLD BECAME ENTANGLED IN THE SEAT BELT OF THE 3RD ROW MIDDLE SEAT. THE SEAT BELT WAS WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK. MY WIFE BECAME AWARE WHEN THE OTHER CHILDREN SCREAMED FOR HELP. MY CHILD HAD ALREADY TURNED BLUE AND HE COULD NOT EVEN SPEAK. MY WIFE JUMPED IMMEDIATELY TO THE 3RD ROW BUT THE SEAT BELT WOULD NOT LOOSE AND THERE WAS ANY SLACK TO LOOSEN THE BELT. DURING ALL ATTEMPTS TO LOOSEN IT, THE BELT GOT TIGHTER WHILE MY CHILD WAS BEING ASPHYXIATED. MIRACULOUSLY, SHE WAS ABLE TO LOOSE THE BELT AND RELEASED HIM JUST BEFORE HE DIE .     THE CHILD WAS INJURED IN THE NECK, HAD BRUISES AND BROKEN CAPILLARIES THROUGHOUT HIS FACE, EYES AND EARS, ETC.  DURING THIS WEEK, HE HAD REQUIRED MEDICAL STUDIES INCLUDING GENERAL DOCTOR, PAEDIATRIST, NEURO, OPHTHALMOLOGIST, ENT AND PSYCHOLOGIST.     I AM LOOKING HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH HONDA BY INTERNET...NO LUCK SO FAR. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NOT A SAFETY FEATURE TO MANUALLY LOOSEN THE SEAT BELT IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A MANUAL KEY FOR RELEASE IT FROM THE BOTTOM, BUT IF MY WIFE WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO FIND THE KEY AND RELEASE IT THAT WAY, MY SON WOULD HAVE DIE FOR SURE.     MAKING RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT HONDA FIXED A SAFETY ISSUE CONCERNING CHILD CAR SEATS, BUT THEY HAVE CREATED A NEW SAFETY HAZARD FOR ALL CHILDREN.     I AM SURE THAT HONDA ENGINEERS EVALUATED THIS SAFETY HAZARD BUT RATED WITH A SERIOUS SEVERITY BUT WITH A LOW LIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE. THEREFORE, THIS NOT REQUIRED ANY MEASURES FOR RISK MITIGATION. I THINK THAT GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THIS HAZARD AND ITS POTENTIAL HARMS (MAJOR INJURY, DEATH, ETC), HONDA MUST RE-EVALUATE ITS RISK ASSESSMENT AND TAKE AN ACTION BY REDESIGNING THIS SEAT BELT. IN ADDITION, I THINK HONDA COULD HAVE EVALUATED THIS HAZARD FROM A MISUSE PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER, A NORMAL CHILD PLAYING INSIDE THE CAR COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH. *TR",

IN A PROCESS OF CALLING 5 OTHER LOCAL HONDA DEALERS TRYING TO GET A BETTER PRICING, I LEARNED THAT MY CASE IS NOT THAT RARE AS IT MAY SOUND. I WAS TOLD THAT ON AVERAGE THEY REPLACE ABOUT 2-3 AC CONDENSERS A MONTH. THEN I CHECKED THE INTERNET AND FOUND MUCH MORE ODYSSEY'S OWNER WITH IDENTICAL STORIES.

MY HUSBAND IS ACTIVE DUTY, STATIONED IN HAWAII, SET TO GO TO AFGHANISTAN.  WE CANNOT AFFORD A PLANE TICKET FOR HIM TO COME HOME BECAUSE I HAD TO USE ALL OF OUR SAVINGS FOR THIS.  WHY ARE PEOPLE BEING DECEIVED ABOUT HOW GREAT HONDA IS AND HOW THE ODYSSEY IS THE NUMBER ONE MINIVAN, AND NOT BEING WARNED ABOUT SUCH AN EXPENSIVE DEFECT IN THE DESIGN?  WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS?  AM I TO JUST LET THIS ORGANIZATION TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME?",

ABOUT THE ODD WEAR (EDGES WORN OUT WHILE THE CENTER OF THE TREAD LOOKS FINE, AND SO FAR THEY HAVE CHARGED US FOR AN ALIGNMENT (THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER CHECKING INTO IT UNTIL WE PAID FOR THIS, AND THEN LATER TOLD US THIS WAS A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH THE PAX SYSTEM TIRES, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ONLY TRYING TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS OFF OF US, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER).  THE VEHICLE HAS TPMS, SO WE KNOW TIRE PRESSURE IS NOT A FACTOR (AT LEAST IF FOLLOWING HONDA'S RECOMMENDATIONS IS ASSUMED TO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE WEAR). WE DO NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE AGGRESSIVELY (IT IS A MINIVAN, AND CARRIES OUR 2 YOUNG CHILDREN, WITH MY WIFE BEING THE PRIMARY DRIVER, SO THE ODDS OF ANYONE WITH THIS COMPLAINT ON THE ODYSSEY ARE THAT THEY DRIVE VERY CONSERVATIVELY). THE DEALER HAS TOLD US FOR APPROX 10000 MILES (HALF THE TOTAL MILEAGE DRIVEN TO THIS POINT) THAT THE WEAR IS NOT ABNORMAL, BUT NOW WE CAN NOT LONGER DRIVE THE VAN IN INCLEMENT WEATHER SINCE THE LAST 1/5 OF BOTH SIDES OF THE TIRES HAVE WORN TO THE POINT OF NOT HAVING ANY WATER SIPES LEFT TO PREVENT HYDROPLANING IN RAINY CONDITIONS. THE DEALERS SERVICE DEPT HAS REVEALED THAT THEY HAVE HAD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE TIRES, BUT MICHELIN IN THEIR TYPICALLY \"HOLIER THAN THOUGH\" MANNER OF NEVER MAKING A BAD PRODUCT (THIS WORDS FROM THE DEALER REP) HAS STONE WALLED ATTEMPTS AT GETTING THEM TO ADMIT FAULT WITH THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT. FURTHERMORE, THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE PRODUCT'S REPLACEMENT, LEAVING CUSTOMERS NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY A KING'S RANSOM FOR ANOTHER SET OF THESE TIRES WE DO NOT WANT. WE ARE FILING A COMPLAINT, AND SEEKING ANY INFO ON JOINING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MICHELIN AND HONDA OF AMERICA FOR SELLING A PATENTLY DANGEROUS PRODUCT TO A CONSUMER GROUP WHO PURCHASED A PRODUCT WITH SAFETY BEING A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE PURCHASE DECISION.  *NM",

ONLY THE TWO FRONT AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  MY 2-YEAR-OLD BOY WAS SITTING RIGHT BEHIND THE DRIVER' SEAT.  HE WAS BUCKLED IN A 5-POINT CAR SEAT.  HIS SIDE SLIDING DOOR'S WINDOW (TINTED) SHATTERED AND THE BROKEN GLASS FLEW INTO HIS FACE WITH FORCE.  HIS FACE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD AT ONCE.  AT THE ER, THE DOCTOR HAD TO USE X-RAY AND DUG OUT CHUNKS OF GLASSES OUT OF HIS FACE.  HE GOT 30 PLUS STITCHES AND WILL NEED TO HAVE PLASTIC SURGERIES LATER DUE TO FLESH LOSS AND BIG CUTS ON THE LEFT-SIDE OF HIS FACE.  IF THE WINDOW DIDN'T SHATTER AND FLY WITH FORCE, MY BOY SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNHURT IN THIS ACCIDENT.  AS A FAMILY VEHICLE, ODYSSEY SHOULD HAVE SHATTER-PROOF WINDOWS.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MAJOR DEFECT AND WOULD LIKE TO START AN INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE.  WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU.  WE STILL HAVE THE VAN AT THE REPAIR SHOP UNTOUCHED.  THE VAN IS GOING TO BE TOTALED.  IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE VAN, WE WILL BE HAPPY TO DO SO.

FROM THE FIRST DAY I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE FROM CLINTON HONDA'S PARKING LOT I IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED EXCESSIVE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION. IT WAS HORRIBLE AND STARTED AT 65 MPH AND CONTINUED TO 75 MPH.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE VERY NEXT DAY AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS OUT OF BALANCED WHEELS -- EACH WHEEL WAS OFF BY 30 GRAMS. THAT SAME DAY I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE WHEELS ZEROED OUT AND HE DIDN'T FEEL THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE HE COULD DO. I INSISTED THAT HE REPAIR THE PROBLEM SO HE TOLD ME TO COME BACK A WEEK LATER AFTER HE SENT A MECHANIC OUT FOR TRAINING ON THEIR HUNTER WHEEL BALANCING MACHINE.     I RETURNED A WEEK LATER AND THIS TIME THEY ROAD-FORCED BALANCED THE TIRES AND FOUND THEM TO BE 10 GRAMS OFF EACH SIDE. THEY ALSO FOUND A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE ISSUE WHICH SUGGESTED A TOE ADJUSTMENT -- WHICH THEY PERFORMED. I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN EXPECTING THE PROBLEM TO BE RESOLVED BUT IT WASN'T. INSTEAD, I NOW HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM WHERE THE VEHICLE PULLS EXCESSIVELY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT DEPENDING ON THE CURVATURE OF THE ROAD --WHEREAS BEFORE IT WOULD KEEP ITS INTENDED COURSE.     I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN -- THIS TIME TO SPEAK WITH MY SALES PERSON AND THE SALES MANAGER. THE SALES PERSON ACCOMPANIED ME FOR A TEST DRIVE TO WITNESS THE PROBLEM. HE NOTICED THE PROBLEM AS I DID SO HE SUGGESTED THAT WE TEST DRIVE ANOTHER ODYSSEY TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM IS SYSTEMATIC. WE DROVE A GOLD COLOR ODYSSEY (BOTH HIM AND I) AND THAT VEHICLE DID NOT EXHIBIT THE PROBLEM. ALSO, I MENTIONED TO THE SALES PERSON THAT THE SLIVER DEMO I INITIALLY DROVE DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM EITHER.   *NM",

AGAIN THIS MONTH (JULY) I NOTICED THE PROBLEM AGAIN, I TOOK IT IN TWO DAYS AGO AND HONDA REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM SAYING THAT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER TO HAVE THE ISSUE RESOLVED.  THEY TELL US THAT THEY WON'T HAVE THE PARTS IN UNTIL THEN.  I FEEL THAT THEY ARE AVOIDING THE FIXING THE PROBLEM AS TO AVOID THE LEMON LAW SINCE THIS IS THEIR SECOND TIME FIXING THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES BEFORE THIS SUCH AS BROKEN CD PLAYER....SLOW DRAINING OF BATTERY, AND PROBLEMS WITH DVD AND VEHICLE INTERIOR.  OVERALL I AM VERY CONCERERNED WHEN MY CAR IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES AND THIS COMPANY REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM.....I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE BUT DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR A RENTAL UNTIL SEPTEMBER.",
