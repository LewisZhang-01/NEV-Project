MY MECHANIC FIXED THE BRAKES AROUND THE SAME TIME AND TOOK AROUND THE BLOCK, WENT OVER A BUMP AND THE BULB CAME BACK ON. I'VE HAD ISSUE EVER SINCE. USUALLY I CAN GIVE IT A LITTLE TAP AND IT WILL COME BACK ON. NOT THIS TIME! IVE REPLACED THE BULB TWICE SINCE 2013, IT'S AT 80,555 MILES NOW AND IT WON'T COME BACK ON AT ALL!  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL, FOR I'VE SEARCHED THE INTERENT AND FOUND MANY MAZDA 6'S IN MANY MODEL YEARS THAT HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE.    MY DRIVERS SEAT BELT JUST BEGAN GETTING STUCK AT 80,300 MILES. THE DAY BEFORE FATHER'S DAY  WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED. (JUNE 20, 2015). I WENT TO TARGET AND I COULDN'T GET OUT OF MY SEATBELT WHEN I TURNED THE CAR OFF. I JIGGLED IT AND PUSHED ON IT REPEATEDLY UNTIL I HEARD IT CLICK AGAIN AND IT FINALLY RELEASED. THIS IS INCREDIBLY UNSAFE AND I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW I PUT MY SEATBELT ON UNTIL I HEAR THE \"RIGHT CLICK\" OR IT WON'T LET ME OUT.     MY CRUISE WENT OUT ON MY WAY BACK FROM OK IN AUG. 2013, RIGHT AROUND 65,000 MILES I BELIEVE. I WAS COMING UP ON THE CA BORDER AND HAD TO STOP FOR INSPECTION AND AS I SLOWED DOWN, MY CAR BEGAN LUNGING FORWARD DESPITE THE FACT THAT I APPLIED THE BRAKES. I TURNED IT OFF AND BACK ON AND IT STOPPED UNTIL I USED THE CRUISE AGAIN. THEN IT'D LUNGE AGAIN WHEN I'D SLOW DOWN OR ATTEMPT TO STOP. I CALLED MY FRIEND AND HE SAID TO STOP USING THE CRUISE. THE PROBLEM HAS NOT CONTINUED, BUT I ALSO HAVEN'T USED THE CRUISE SINCE 2013. MY CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 100K MILES AND I BOUGHT IT NEW. I'VE MAINTAINED IT AND IT STILL HAD OTHER ISSUES. THE KEYLESS ENTRY, BOSE 6 DISC, ALTERNATOR AND THERMOSTAT HAVE ALL MALFUNCTIONED!  THE LIGHTS ON THE RADIO DISPLAY DON'T LIGHT PROPERLY AND THE HEADLINER FALLS DOWN DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS TO FIX IT....UPDATED 01/06/16 *BF",

BEGAN LOOKING ON INTERNET AND FOUND THERE IS A COMMON COMPLAINT THAT MAZDA'S \"EAT LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS\". THIS, IN MY OPINION, IS A DEALER PROBLEM AND A SAFETY ISSUE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE HEADLIGHTS. WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THE CAR A YEAR (ALTHOUGH USED, NEW TO US. WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THE FORMER OWNERS HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE), AND WE ARE HAVING TO REPLACE THE FIRST REPLACEMENT 6 MONTHS LATER AND NOW THE 1ST TIME FOR THE OTHER ONE. BEING THAT THAT IS UNUSUAL, I BEGAN SEARCHING ONLINE. ACCORDING TO WHAT I FOUND, WE'LL BE DOING THIS AGAIN. THEREFORE, I AM HOPING THAT WITH YOUR HELP AND INVESTIGATION, THERE WILL BE A RECALL IN WHICH MAZDA CAN PICK UP THE TAB WHICH, APPARENTLY, RIGHTLY BELONGS TO THEM.     FOLLOWING ARE JUST A FEW OF THE COMPLAINTS I FOUND. THERE ARE MANY MORE!!!

IT IS PLAINLY OBVIOUS THAT A PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF \"VIEWS\" LISTED FOR CERTAIN TOPICS, SUCH THE HEADLIGHTS (MANY THOUSANDS OF OWNERS HAVE HEADLIGHT FAILURE PROBLEMS). MAZDA SHOULD HAVE ISSUED A BULLETIN OR A RECALL SINCE THE CORRODING PJB IS CLEARLY A SAFETY PROBLEM. THIS LOOKS LIKE A DESIGN/ENGINEERING FLAW. EVERY ELECTRICIAN AND PLUMBER KNOWS TO NEVER PUT MOISTURE SOURCES ABOVE ELECTRICAL BOXES. SHAME ON THEM.",

I HAVE PICTURES OF THE STEERING COLUMN SHOWING HOW THE AIRBAG WAS GONE EXCEPT A SMALL PIECE OF YOU NEED THEM. I AM GOING TO SEE MY CAR LATER TODAY AND AM HOPING TO GET THE AIRBAG TO KEEP IN CASE YOU NEED IT. ALSO, THE CAR IS REGISTERED IN MY HUSBAND'S NAME [XXX] JUST FOR YOU FYI.

I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND PRESSED THE BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD.  IT WAS A DEFINITE HARD PUSH ON THE BRAKE -- AS IF I HAD LOST POWER BRAKES.  THERE WERE CARS AHEAD OF ME STOPPED IN THE ROAD BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT.  I MANAGED TO STOP -- BUT BARELY.  I ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AFTER FINALLY STOPPING MY CAR WHEN IT SURGED FORWARD SEVERAL FEET WHILE MY FOOT WAS FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE.

WHEN I TURNED THE ENGINE BACK ON, THE REVVING HAD STOPPED.  A SIMILAR, BUT BRIEFER INCIDENT HAPPENED A FEW WEEKS AGO.  I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD AND USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP THE CAR.  THIS ISSUE HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO.  I ALMOST RAN INTO THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW OF A STORE.  WHEN I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR AND PUT IT IN PARK, THE ENGINE REVVED REPEATEDLY (VERY, VERY HIGH THAT TIME) AND DID NOT STOP UNTIL I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP.  THEY CALLED IN ENGINEERS AND COULD NEVER REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAID IT WAS UNLIKELY TO EVER OCCUR AGAIN.  WELL NOW IT HAS OCCURRED TWICE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE.  SOMEONE WILL BE HURT OR KILLED.  I SEE THAT THE MAZDA TRIBUTE HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE.

THE CONTEXT IS WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTOMOBILE'S TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM.    I WAS DRIVING ON A WET ROAD WHERE THE RAIN HAD STOPPED ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER.   THERE WAS NO STANDING WATER AS THE RAIN HAD BEEN LIGHT ANYWAY.  I WAS ON A THREE-LANE (6-LANES TOTAL) NARROW DIVIDED HIGHWAY GOING ABOUT 45 MPH.  FROM THE MIDDLE LANE, I WAS ENTERING THE LEFT LANE AS A FAST DRIVER IN THAT LANE PASSED BY ME.  AS I WAS ENTERING THE LANE, THIS DRIVER WHO HAD BEEN PULLING AHEAD QUICKLY, HIT THEIR BRAKES AND DECIDED TO MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE LANE (AND MAYBE FURTHER TO MAKE THE EXIT).    AT THIS POINT, I TAPPED MY BRAKES AND IT WAS THEN THAT MY VEHICLE STARTED MOVING HARD RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY TURNING INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I WAS TRYING TO STEER IT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT IT CONTINUED MOVING.  IN THE END,  IT WAS LIKE BACK-TO-BACK U-TURNS BUT THERE WAS NO CRASH, DAMAGE, OR INJURIES.   DURING THE INCIDENT I FELT THAT I HAD LITTLE CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE AND THE WHOLE INCIDENT WAS BAFFLING SINCE I HAVE DRIVEN ALMOST ALL OF THE 47,000 MILES ON THE CAR IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER WITH NO SUCH EXPERIENCE OR EVEN HINT OF SUCH AN EXPERIENCE.    WHILE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MANY THINGS THAT CAUSED THIS, I THINK THAT THE SITUATION MAY HAVE BEEN STARTED AND THEN EXACERBATED BY THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM. AFTER TAPPING MY BRAKES, I THINK THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM DETECTED THE UNEVEN SPEED OF MY FRONT WHEELS AND ENGAGED TO BEGIN REGULATING THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUED DURING MOST OF THE INCIDENT AN EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM.    I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM WITH DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE CAUSES.  I AM REPORTING THIS IN CASE OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE AND A PATTERN EMERGES.  *TR",

IT WOULD BE DRIVING FINE, I WOULD PARK AND GET OUT.  WHEN RETURNING TO THE CAR, IT WILL NOT TURN AT ALL.  INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIGHTS AND RADIO WORKED FINE BUT CAR WILL NOT TURN.  THE FIRST TWO TIMES THE BATTERY WAS JUMPED AND THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO A MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND REPLACED UNDER THE MAZDA BATTERY MANUFACTURER WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY WENT OUT BEFORE THE 36 MONTH WARRANTY.  THE LAST TIME IN AUGUST OF 2010, THE BATTERY WILL NOT JUMP. I PAID TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO A MAZDA DEALERSHIP.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE BATTERY HAD A CRACK IN IT AND ACID LEAKED OUT AND AS A RESULT, THE ENGINE WIRING HARNESS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  AT THIS TIME, THE BATTERY WAS COVERED UNDER THE MAZDA MANUFACTURER WARRANTY AND THE WIRING HARNESS WAS COVERED UNDER MY MAZDA EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE LEAKING ACID COULD HAVE CAUSED AN EXPLOSION AND MY FAMILY WAS LUCKY.  I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP SAYING THAT THE MANUFACTURER WARRANTY WILL REPLACE ONLY THE BATTERY ITSELF AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY IS DENYING THE ENTIRE CLAIM BECAUSE THE DAMAGE TO THE WIRING HARNESS WAS FROM THE BATTERY ACID.  SO, HERE I AM WITH A BATTERY UNDER MAZDA MANUFACTURER WARRANTY,  COVERED BY A MAZDA EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN AND I HAD TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY ITSELF. I PAID FOR THE TOW, THE LABOR AND PARTS FOR THE HARNESS, RENTAL CAR WHILE IT WAS BEING SERVICES.   AND THE FACT IS THAT THERE WAS A FAULTY BATTERY THAT LEAKED ACID, PUT MY FAMILY IN DANGER, AND I WAS STUCK WITH THE COLLATERAL DAMAGES.  CONSIDERING THAT THIS WAS MY 3RD BATTERY REPLACEMENT IN 5 YEARS, I'M CERTAIN THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE BATTERIES OR SOMETHING IN THE CAR ITSELF.

THERE WAS A HUSBAND AND WIFE WHOM HAD BEEN DRIVING BEHIND US SINCE THE ENTRANCE OF THE ON RAMP AND `WITNESSED THE ENTIRE ACCIDENT.

A FEW WEEKS LATER, I NOTICED THE LEFT FRONT TIRE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  SINCE DAY ONE, ALL 4 OF THE TIRES WOULDN'T HOLD THEIR TIRE PRESSURE (EVEN WITH NO LEAKS) WHICH COULDN'T BE FIGURED OUT BY \"PROFESSIONALS.\"  I RETURNED MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY TOLD ME TO IMMEDIATELY GET MY CAR INTO A MICHELIN TIRE CENTER.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN CAUSED BY A LOW SPEED IMPACT AND A GASH IN THE TIRES AND WOULD HAVE TO BUY 4 NEW TIRES ($190 PER TIRE).  THIS WAS DEFINITELY NOT CAUSED BY AN IMPACT OR A GASH SO I TOOK THE CAR TO ANOTHER MICHELIN CENTER.  THEY TOLD ME THIS TIME THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY HIGH SPEED IMPACT BUT THAT THERE WAS NO GASH AND I WOULD HAVE TO BUY THEIR TIRES ($199.42 PER TIRE).  FINDING THEIR STORIES NOT MATCHING UP, I TOOK IT TO A THIRD MICHELIN CENTER.  THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY HITTING A CURB!  THE EMPLOYEE THEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THE TWO BULGED TIRES ON EITHER SIDE COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY HITTING A CURB OR HIGH/LOW SPEEN IMPACT AFTER AN INSPECTION.  HE RECOMMENDED A DIFFERENT TIRE, NOT A MICHELIN.  I ENDED UP BUYING NEW TIRES COSTING ME A GRAND TOTAL OF ALMOST $1,000.  I INSISTED ON THE OLD TIRES WHICH THE TIRE CENTER DIDN'T WANT TO READILY GIVE BACK TO ME.  UPON INSPECTION, THERE WAS NEITHER GASH NOR TREAD WEAR AS THEY HAD LESS THAN 20,000 MILES.  AT ALL THREE MICHELIN DEALERS, THEY REFUSED TO COVER THEM UNDER WARRANTY.  IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THESE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS FROM DAY ONE.
