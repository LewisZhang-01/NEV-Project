        "summary": "2001 FORD 550 SHUTTLE BUS, MANUFACTURED BY KRYSTAL KOACH PURCHASED IN MARCH 2007.  THIS 26 PASSENGER BUS CAME FROM KRYSTAL WITH REAR CHASSIS(AIR RIDE, INDEPENDENT SUSPENSION) SINGLE WHEELS OUT OF LINE.  ALL MECHANISM WELDED IN PLACE, THUS NO ADJUSTMENTS. THIS BUS HAD ONLY 4800 MILES ON IT WHEN WE PURCHASED IT IN MARCH 2007.  HAD BLOWOUT ON TIRE WITH ONLY FEW MILES ON TIRE DUE TO ALIGNMENT. ALL OTHER TIRES WERE WEARING PREMATURELY.  AFTER SPENDING APPROXIMATELY 4000 DOLLARS TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM,(INCLUDED REPLACING TRUNNIONS. BUSHINGS,ETC.) WE CONTACTED KRYSTAL KOACH IN BEREA, CA. ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY WOULD NOT HELP BECAUSE THIS WAS \"ONE OF A KIND\" BUS BUILT THERE AND NEVER WENT INTO PRODUCTION DUE TO COSTS.  WE FEEL THEY(KRYSTAL)PUT AN UNSAFE VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY.  OUR DESIRE IS TO KEEP THE BUS, BUT WE FEEL KRYSTAL SHOULD SHARE IN COSTS OF REPAIRS.  CAN YOU HELP?    THANKS.  *JB",
