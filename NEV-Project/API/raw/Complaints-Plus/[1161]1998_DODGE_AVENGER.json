THE LEFT SIDE THEN FAILED ON 4/25, ONLY 5 DAYS AFTER THE DEALER \"INSPECTED\" THE BALL JOINT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RECALL - UNBELIEVABLE!  THIS TIME THE LEFT WHEEL CAME OFF WHICH HAD THE POTENTIAL FOR A SEVERE IF NOT FATAL ACCIDENT!  MY DAUGHTER HAD JUST EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND WENT AROUND A VERY SHARP EXIT RAMP BEND.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DODGE DEALER FOR REPAIRS, AND AGAIN THE DEALER IS DENYING THE RECALL FAILURE.  I SECURED THE OLD PARTS FROM THE LEFT SIDE - AND CLEARLY THERE IS CORROSION IN THE BALL JOINT THAT CAUSE FAILURE OF THE BALL STUD.  I TALKED TO THE SHOP-TECH DOING THE REPAIR WORK AND HE COMMENTED ON HOW YOU COULD SEE THE CORRODED METAL IN THE BALL SOCKET AND THEN WHERE THE BREAK OCCURED YOU COULD SEE THE SHINNY METAL.  I AM TRYING TO DEAL WITH DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORPORATE ON REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF THE ACTUAL REPAIRS AND FOR COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO THE TIRES AND WHEELS.  BEYOND THAT HOWEVER, I AM GREATLY CONCERNED REGARDING THE \"INSPECTION\" NOT CATCHING THE IMMINENT LEFT SIDE FAILURE ONLY 5 DAYS LATER - THIS TO ME DEMONSTRATES A POTENTIAL FLAW IN THE RECALL REQUIREMENTS; AND, I AM GREATLY CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE OTHERS OUT THERE THAT MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY AS MY DAUGHTER WAS IN AVOIDING A VERY SERIOUS OR FATAL ACCIDENT FROM THIS TYPE OF FAILURE - I THINK MORE DRASTIC MEASURES SHOULD BE INSTITUTED.
