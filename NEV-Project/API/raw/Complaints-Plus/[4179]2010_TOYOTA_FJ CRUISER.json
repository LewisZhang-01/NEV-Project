BRAKES THEY PULSE WHEN SLOWING ONLY AT HIGH SPEED.  (65 MPH) I DO NOT RIDE THE BRAKES, OR RUN THE CAR HARD. THIS HAPPENED AFTER NORMAL DRIVING.  SEEMS LIKE WARPED DISKS, BUT I DO NOT STOP FAST, OR DRIVE LIKE I'M RACING.  NOTE: HEADLIGHTS HAD TO BE READJUSTED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT POINT UP THE ROAD ENOUGH, MAKING HUGE BLIND SPOT AT OVER 40 MPH. I HAD DEALER RE-ADJUST, THEY POINTED THE DOWN SO FAR THEY MADE IT WORSE. I ADJUSTED THEM AGAIN, MYSELF. THE FACTORY OFF ROAD PACKAGE IT CAME WITH,  I'M SURE WAS THE PROBLEM.

THE FIRST TWO INCIDENTS I DISMISSED AS DRIVER ERROR BUT NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.  THIS IS CERTAINLY A VEHICLE DEFECT, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.  HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED:    I WAS AT A FULL STOP AT A RED LIGHT.  ON GREEN, I ACCELERATED VERY SLOWLY AS I WAS TAKING A 90 DEGREE LEFT TURN.  AT THE EXIT OF THE TURN THERE WAS A METAL PLATE (MAYBE A MANHOLE COVER OR OTHER UTILITY TYPE COVER) WHICH WAS PART OF THE ROAD.  I PASSED OVER THIS OBJECT, LIKE ALL OTHER TRAFFIC DOES, ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS I STARTED APPLYING MY BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN (I THINK I BRAKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER...NOT SURE).  I HAD A SUDDEN FEELING THAT THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM WAS ON AND THE TRUCK WAS NOT SLOWING NEARLY AS FAST AS REQUIRED. THE BRAKES CLEARLY FELT AS THEY FAILED.   ANOTHER LIGHT LAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  HAD THERE BEEN TRAFFIC, I WOULD HAVE REAR ENDED THE PERSON AND BEEN AT FAULT.      ON THE PREVIOUS OCCASION, I FELT THE SAME EXPERIENCE.  AT THAT TIME I REACTED BY LIFTING MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE, AND IT RESTORED BRAKING POWER.  AGAIN, FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS IN FRONT SO I DID NOT COLLIDE.  HOWEVER, BOTH TIMES MY STOPPING DISTANCE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND UNSAFELY.    WEATHER CONDITIONS AT BOTH OF THESE TIMES WAS DAYTIME, CLEAR, DRY, AND TEMPERATURES SAY IN THE 30-40S.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ICE, RAIN, SAND, OR SNOW.    BRAKE ISSUE COMES ON, IT SEEMS, WITH A SUDDEN WHEEL HOP OR LOSS OF TRACTION, ALMOST IN TANDEM.

THE STEERING SEEMS TERRIBLY WEAK AND UNPREDICTABLE. I'VE HAD THE WHEELS ALIGNED THREE TIMES, BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. TOYOTA SAYS THE THERE IS NO ISSUE BUT THAT THE STEERING ON THIS STYLE VEHICLE IS JUST SENSITIVE. WHILE I REALLY ENJOY THE VEHICLE, I'M ALWAYS ON FULL ALERT WHEN DRIVING KNOWING THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME, THE STEERING MAY SUDDENLY TAKE THE VEHICLE LEFT OR RIGHT WITH NO PREDICTABILITY. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A NEWER VEHICLE THAT REQUIRES SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE STEERING. IT MAY GO LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN THE ROADWAY SURFACE CHANGES, WHEN ENCOUNTERING UNEVEN ROADWAY SURFACES, WHEN TRANSITIONING FROM WET TO DRY OR ICE TO CLEAR PAVEMENT, OR FOR SEEMINGLY NO REASON AT ALL. OFTEN I FIND MYSELF ACTUALLY COUNTER STEERING (INPUTTING OPPOSITE TENSION ON THE WHEEL) TO KEEP THE VEHICLE FROM GOING LEAVING THE LANE I'M TRAVELING IN. IT IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE WHILE CHANGING LANES. AS I BEGIN A SLOW MOVE TO AN ADJACENT LANE, THE STEERING MAY SUDDENLY JUST PULL ME OVER TO WHICH I THEN HAVE TO COUNTER STEER TO KEEP FROM GOING TOO FAR.     I TOOK MY 2010 FJ TO A TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT HERE IN ABQ, AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, OF COURSE.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.    WITH MY '07 FJ I HAD THE FRONT BRAKES DONE, ALL NEW LUG NUTS, NEW TIRES, NEW SHOCKS AND STRUTS, 7 ALIGNMENTS, AND 3 ROTATION AND BALANCES (ON THE NEW TIRES), ALL WITHIN ONLY SIX MONTHS USING 5 DIFFERENT SHOPS, AND IT STILL WASN'T FIXED.
