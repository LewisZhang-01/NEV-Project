        "summary": "My car was experiencing excessive engine motor oil consumption that progressively became extreme. Based on internet information, others owners were having similar oil consumption issues.  The cars check engine light came on and the engine became very erratic around a sharp curve in Vermont. Struggled to get the car to the side of the road prior to the engine completely stalling.  Unable to get the vehicle restarted. Luckily it was still daylight and that it failed in an area where I still had cell phone service. A local garage towed the car and and determined that there was no compression in one cylinder. They contacted Lia Hyundai in Albany NY and the service representative informed them that the engine would be covered but that the would have to inspect the car. Spent over $300 have the car towed to the Hyundai dealer. After inspection, we were informed that there was a burnt valve and that the valve assembly had to be rebuilt. They told us this repair would not be covered under the recent class action settlement which covers the small block assembly if the Knock Sensor Detection System Software was installed (Service Campaign 953). The software was installed previously. The total estimated cost for the valve assembly repairs are over $4,600.  Based on the recent inflated costs of vehicles we decided to proceed with the repairs. Spent hours contacting Hyundai Corporate directly on several occasions to rectify the matter to no avail. We were told that they were going to contact the local dealer and get back to us. We never received a returned call. Lia Hyundai did provide us with a loaner vehicle and we are currently waiting for the repairs to be completed. We also asked them for an engine compression test once the repairs are complete and for the return of all damaged components. We will verify the compression results at an independent service center and also perform an oil consumption test. We have approximately 100,300 miles on the car prior to the failure.",

Put vehicle in park, but it started rolling back into traffic once took the foot of the brake. Had to wait in vehicle with the brake until tow truck arrived. The vehicle was towed to a dealership and and it was determined that engine had excessive bearing wear. I was told by the dealership Hyundai that based on miles that Hyundai was not going to assist with any financial support to fix the vehicle. I called Hyundai 1(800) 633-5151 and spoke with Lindsey (supervisor) who said that she would not look up recalls from the NHTSA and that my specific vin number was not identified in any current recall for that issue. I asked her to look up to see how many vehicles were affected with the safe issue year and engine size safety recall 17V578000 from the NHTSA.  She said that if not in her computer linked to a specific vehicle she would not help and then hung up.   We feel blessed could have been a lot worse at high speeds. The main issue is the Hyundai representative showed no concern for the safety issue once I informed them that there may be more vehicles with a similar issue to the current recall. It appears the issue is a lot larger than the initial number of vehicles recalled and will probably lead to severe injury or death if not looked into. I am hopeful they report this issue themselves, but know that they are probably more concerned about profits than consumer safety.",

This is preposterous that they recommended me to continue to drive the car but not keep it next to anything. I am a young mother with an 8 month old baby & I am petrified to drive the car & they will not provide me with a substitute car or rental car until they can fix the issue, which they have no timeframe to complete.

The next day it was towed to a Hyundai dealership close to home, Hyundai denied the first claim because they said it was the oil change companies fault. I then called the warranty company and the adjuster came out examined the car he found out that wasn't the case, it was internal damage cause by the manufacturer. Botls came loose that cracked something and metal chips got into my engine. My extended warranty denied covering it because it wasn't basic engine failure it was cause by the production of the vehicle and the faulty bolts that internally damage itself. I resubmitted the claim to Hyundai for repairs since we know now it wasnt outside negligence and the extended warranty company wasn't going to cover it. The advisor told me the second claim was denied as well , after speaking to the consumer affairs department myself they still denied having any part and the faulty engine. I'm in a Facebook community group and these people are going through this daily with Hyundai they are putting bad engines in cars once the original owner finds out they're trading them in and the second owner buys them in the car fails we aren't covered under the powertrain warranty because it only applies to the first owner. Hyundai is ripping people off and stealing our hard worked for money and getting away with it! They're picking and choosing who the engine failure class action lawsuit applies to even though we all have bad failed engines! I have been stuck making payments on a car for 3 months that I cannot drive and I owe $18,000 on a totaled car and they care nothing about goodwill and helping their customers who have spent thousands on their cars.",

The next day it was towed to a Hyundai dealership close to home, Hyundai denied the first claim because they said it was the oil change companies fault. I then called the warranty company and the adjuster came out examined the car he found out that wasn't the case, it was internal damage cause by the manufacturer. Botls came loose that cracked something and metal chips got into my engine. My extended warranty denied covering it because it wasn't basic engine failure it was cause by the production of the vehicle and the faulty bolts that internally damage itself. I resubmitted the claim to Hyundai for repairs since we know now it wasnt outside negligence and the extended warranty company wasn't going to cover it. The advisor told me the second claim was denied as well , after speaking to the consumer affairs department myself they still denied having any part and the faulty engine. I'm in a Facebook community group and these people are going through this daily with Hyundai they are putting bad engines in cars once the original owner finds out they're trading them in and the second owner buys them in the car fails we aren't covered under the powertrain warranty because it only applies to the first owner. Hyundai is ripping people off and stealing our hard worked for money and getting away with it! They're picking and choosing who the engine failure class action lawsuit applies to even though we all have bad failed engines!

The following day I had the vehicle towed to the local Hyundai dealership. Within a few days I was told the vehicle failed a rod bearing test and that it was being submitted to Hyundai for review and hopeful assistance with replacement because the engine was done. It was indicated that because I had the larger engine and there were no recalls on that one it wasn't likely Hyundai would help but it was worth a shot to try. It took several weeks but Hyundai finally responded and said they would not assist. I was advised by the dealership to file my own claim and argue so I did. It took over a month to get a response from Hyundai despite multiple calls from me and Hyundai basically told me I was on my own. So, I have a blown engine in a vehicle I owe over $16,000 on that only has 103,000 miles. I have taken appropriate care of the vehicle and it has NEVER run low on oil. This is a catastrophic failure with no recourse. Hyundai does not make the engine any longer (gee I wonder why? ) and a remanufactured engine with a 1 year warranty will cost me between $8,000 and $11,000.

A half mile away from home it slowed to a walking pace and shut down. I looked under the vehicle, oil was everywhere, i looked under the hood and seen the same thing.  After a half mile tow my mechanic of 12 years who inspects the vehicle and does all the repairs and oil changes three to four times a year stated the pins and rods under the engine fell apart and blew a hole in the bottom of the engine.  My mechanic T.J.Burns at Burns Automotive, CarMax mechanic and Precision Auto all in Greenville, South Carolina said the 2.4 Liter engines from this manufacturer are known for blowing out and dying after 100,000 miles regardless of proper maintenance and this IS a a manufacturer's  defect in their professional opinion.",

I had to negotiate across 3 lanes of traffic in order to exit the highway to find a safe stop to contact roadside assistance. Some smoke was coming from the engine but no fire.

Roadside assistance towed to local Grayson Hyundai Dealer who inspected the engine and determined the bearing failure within two days.  The check engine light came on at the same instance as the engine failure. There was no advanced warning even though Hyundai performed a recall that updated software to specifically detect and alert to potential failure.  Car is still awaiting warranty repairs by dealer. Dealer will not provide any written details to me or provide any cost or timeline estimates for the repair.  While the failure occurred within the manufacturer\u2019s 5 year/60K mile warranty, the warranty has now expired in the 5 months it has been waiting to be repaired.",

They took it for a test drive and said they could not duplicate the issue and that they did not receive any complaints from anyone.  We believed them until I saw many complaints on various websites including this site.  Then the major issue occurred.  I was merging onto an interstate making a big right hand loop and while I was in the middle of the right turn loop, the car lost power and then it did not come back.  I had multiple cars behind me and many on the highway with nowhere to pull over.  Top speed was 45 mph.  It turned out to be a blown Turbo.  The car is under warranty.  That was in July of 2021.  It is now December 2021 and I still do not have my car with no idea of when it will be fixed.  After telling us they would have the part in August (which didn't happen) then September (which didn't happen) then November (which again did not happen) they said they didn't even show a ship order any longer for the part.  We were told to call customer affairs.  I called them on 11/22 and again on 12/8 - still no one is calling back.  I'm stuck driving a small car while I'm paying for an SUV that no one will give any feedback.  There were many cars at the dealer lot which appeared to be the same issue - same model.  This has to qualify for the lemon law.  The loss of power suddenly is extremely dangerous so if you have one, be careful.",

        "summary": "The engine in our 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SE 3.3L V6 has always had problems with lag/ hesitation when accelerating from a stop from the very beginning of ownership (first owner). This was always dismissed by Hyundai's mechanics as not actually existing, although it did lag constantly. I know many other have reported similar issues so, I include this only that it could potentially be an early sign of a manufacturers defect leading to larger problems later? Now, we regularly change the oil in our Santa Fe and have never seen a single warning light outside of tire pressure warnings. But on 7/29/21, with our vehicle just out of warranty at 112k miles, while accelerating to freeway speed from an on ramp at 60 mph multiple warning lights came and at the same time there was a very large bang from the engine and a large amount of smoke came from under the hood, enough to seriously affect the vision of drivers behind me. There was a very rapid lose of speed and I also observed things falling from the vehicle in the rearview. I luckily managed the vehicle to the shoulder and quickly got out. I thought vehicle was on fire, it may have been, the smoke kept up for 5-10 minutes. At this point the car would not start or run and a large pool of oil and or coolant formed underneath. It was towed to a Hyundai dealer and the prognosis was a broken connecting rod that had blew a large maybe 5\" diameter hole through the bottom of the engine. And now, despite providing proof of recent oil changes, Hyundai has dismissed any manufacturing issues from causing the issue and sighting the problem was from lack of maintenance because of sludge in the engine. Although to my understanding sludge can also be produced rapidly when contaminants, like coolant, from bad valves or head gaskets, enter the oil. When I asked about this the technician literally just didn't answer. So, now we currently owe $7k on a vehicle needing repairs at the quoted price of $8-$14k and Hyundai has closed our case.",

TWO DAYS LATER I'M RUNNING AN ARRON IN TRAFFIC ON A BUSY CITY STREET AND AS I'M DRIVING MY CAR STARTS JERKING AND STALLING AND A FLASHING ENGINE LIGHT ON THE DASH BOARD I PUT MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. CALLED HYUNDAI SERVICE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE I WAS CLOSE BY THE DEALERSHIP THE SERVICE PERSONNEL TOLD ME TO DRIVE THE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP SO I DID. THEY TOLD ME MY ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED. FOR THE SECOND TIME MIND YOU. 1ST TIME WAS A YEAR PRIOR. SO THEY KEPT MY CAR FOR A WEEK AND 2DAYS. GET MY CAR BACK A WEEK LATER I'M DRIVING ON MY WAY TO WORK AND THE FLASHING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN. SO I TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE KNOCK SENSOR THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED THIS TIME. THEY REPAIR IT THE SAME DAY. MEAN WHILE WAITING I FIND AN VIDEO ON YOU TUBE ABOUT THE VERY PROBLEM I WAS HAVING WITH MY VEHICLE. BUT IT'S FROM THE HYUNDAI MANUFACTURES ABOUT THE 2014-2018 SANTA FE ,SONATA AND TUSON VEHICLE ABOUT KNOWN MALFUNCTIONS AND PROBLEMS THESE VEHICLES ARE HAVING AND WOULD HAVE. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THESE ARE NOT RECALLS. NOW AGAIN YESTERDAY 1/16/21",

HOWEVER,  THE DEALER REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION EARLIER THIS YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN NO IMPROVEMENT.  I HAVE REVIEWED MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS HESITATION PROBLEM.  WILL IT TAKE DEATH REPORTS TO HELP US OWNERS? MY ISSUE BEGAN IN 2018 RIGHT AFTER PURCHASE AND THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING MORE OFTEN NOW. NO HELP IS IN SIGHT  WHEN HYUNDAI AND THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO ADMIT THE PROBLEM AND MAKES ME AND OTHER OWNERS FEEL LIKE WE DON'T KNOW OUR VEHICLES OR OUR OWN MINDS!! WE NEED HELP BEFORE A DEATH OCCURS NOT AFTER!!",

AFTER THAT I STOPPED USING VEHICLE. I SENT HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS A COMPLAINT AND THEY BRUSHED IT OFF. SINCE I DIDNT BUY THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER I TOOK FOR SERVICE THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME A LONER. SUSPENSION HAS A DEFECT CHANGED TIRES AT 15000 MILES DUE TO HUMMING FROM REAR, HAD VEHICLE ALIGNED AND NEW TIRES 6 MONTHS LATER TIRES ARE WORN HYUNDAI HAS SUSPENSION ISSUES. LAST, SO FAR IS ENGINE KNOCKS WHEN STARTING VEHICLE. ITS A SHAME THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON VEHICLE THAT DONT SERVE OUR NEEDS AND HYUNDAI DOES NOT CARE BUT TO HAVE THERE PAYMENTS ON TIME. I CONTACTED MY ATTORNEY, PLANNING TO DROP OFF AT DEALER AND RETURN TO HYUNDAI SO THE FINANCE COMPANY CAN TAKE IT BACK EITHER I GET MY ISSUES FIXED JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD OR I STOP PAYING AND TAKE IT BACK. IF YOU ANYBODY THAT IS INTERESTED IN BUYING A HYUNDAI VEHICLE LIKE OURS SEND THEM ELSEWHERE.",

I NEVER SAW ANY OF THESE.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER ALONG WITH A VIDEO IN WHICH I TESTED IT RUNNING OVER PARTY BALLOONS.  THEY SAID IT WAS WORKING AS DESIGNED.  I WROTE HYUNDAI AMERICA AND THEY SUGGESTED I TAKE TO ANOTHER DEALER WHICH I DID AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING.  NO ONE CARES OR IS INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS.  I HAVE ATTACHED A COUPLE OF STILL PHOTOS I TOOK FROM MY VIDEO SHOWING JUST BEFORE AND AFTER THE COLLISION WITH THE BALLOONS.  I HAVE SEVERAL VIDEOS, I COULD SEND IF INTERESTED.  THANK YOU",

IN ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS, THERE IS A 2 TO 3 SECOND DELAY BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION WILL SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFT AND THE VEHICLE WILL BLAST OFF. THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE I'VE HAD NEARLY A DOZEN INSTANCES OF BEING NEARLY REAR ENDED BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WON'T ACCELERATE QUICKLY ENOUGH. THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS TO SAY THAT IT'S LIKE TRYING TO ACCELERATE WITH A DIRTY, SEVERELY CLOGGED, 10-YEAR-OLD ENGINE AIR FILTER, AND THE INTAKE CAN'T GET ENOUGH AIR INTO THE ENGINE TO ACCELERATE AS IT SHOULD. I'VE BEEN TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IN EVERY INSTANCE WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO UNTIL HYUNDAI RELEASES AN UPDATE OR A RECALL. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH MY LIFE. I'M AT NEARLY 9,000 MILES AND THE HESITATION IS STILL AS PRONOUNCED AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING. I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO BE PATIENT AND NOT KEEP COMPLAINING TO OUR LOCAL SERVICE CENTER...BUT WE'VE HAD QUITE A FEW CLOSE CALLS, EXTREMELY CLOSE, AND I'M REALLY HOPING THAT HYUNDAI WILL PLEASE FIX THIS SOON! IN FACT, I JUST READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT HYUNDAI REPLACING THE ENGINES IN THE '17 SANTA FE'S BECAUSE OF A MANUFACTURING ISSUE WITH THE CRANKSHAFT PIN CAUSING THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS I'VE EXPERIENCED. SO I HOPE THAT I CAN PLEASE GET MY VEHICLE REPAIRED BEFORE I END UP IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. THANKS!!",

I NEVER HAD HESITATION WHEN 4TH GEAR DOWN SHIFTED TO 3RD GEAR GOING STRAIGHT BUT I NOW HAVE IT ALONG WITH HESITATION WHEN THE CAR DOWN SHIFTS FROM 3RD TO 2ND. I'VE CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE  AND ASKED FOR A BUY BACK AND THEY TOLD ME CHRIS FROM REGIONAL WILL CALL ME BACK IN 3 TO 5 BUSINESS DAYS I'VE CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE TWICE AND ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON MY CASE ( CASE NUMBER 9309476) AND THEY JUST KEEP TELLING ME REGIONAL WILL CALL ME THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR A BUY BACK ON ANY CAR AND I HAVE BEEN VERY PATIENT AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY  BUT AT THIS POINT I FEEL I AM GOING TO HAVE TO CONTACT A LAWYER THAT HANDLES LEMON LAWS TO GET ANY RESULTS.

THE METAL POWER INVERTER BECOME LODGED AGAINST THE WIRING CAUSING A SHORT IN THE WIRING AND CAUSING THE ENTIRE VEHICLE'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TO FAIL. THE EPB (ELECTRONIC PARKING BREAK) BECAME ENGAGED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. ALTHOUGH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE 3RD PARTY POWER INVERTER WAS UNDER THE SEAT, THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN DRIVEN 4 TIMES WITH IT UNDER IT, TOTALING LESS THAN 800 MILES.

THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT VALIDATED THIS; THEY ARE SUGGESTING IT WAS THE INVERTER THAT CAUSED THE WIRES TO BECOME BARE. OUR OPINION IS THAT THE INVERTER WAS NOT THERE LONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE THAT WIRING TO BECOME BARE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS PREVIOUS RECALL THAT EVERYTHING STARTED TO MAKE SENSE.

WHEN I GOT IT PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I NOTICED FLAMES COMING OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE. I GRABBED WHAT I COULD AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR. WITHIN 5 MIN THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. I HAD APPROXIMATELY 675 MILES ON IT. I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI BUT THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO ME. I ORDERED A COPY OF THE POLICE REPORT BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET. I HAVE PICTURES THAT I HAVE ATTACHED. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE. THANKFULLY I DIDN'T HAVE GRANDKIDS IN THE CAR, I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THEM OUT.",
