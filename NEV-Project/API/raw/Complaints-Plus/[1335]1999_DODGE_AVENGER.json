CHRYSLER KNOWS THEY PUT A FAULTY CAMSHAFT SENSOR INSIDE THE DISTRIBUTOR SO WHEN IT DOES FAIL WHICH IT DOES IN EVERY 6 CYCLE AVENGER, THE STEALERSHIP TRIES TO TELL CUSTOMERS THAT THE SENSOR CANNOT BE REPLACED AND YOU HAVE TO GET A NEW DISTRIBUTOR ASSEMBLY WHICH THEY CHARGE $ 1500 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. YOU CAN'T BUY ONE ANYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY CAM SENSOR PROBLEM AND THEY DO THIS INTENTIONALLY TO GET YOU TO SPEND MONEY ON CHRYSLER PARTS. THEY PUT THE CAM SENSOR IN THE DISTRIBUTOR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE FROM THE IGNITION COIL WOULD CAUSE THE SENSOR TO FAIL. WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHES MORE AND MORE THE WORSE THE SENSOR GETS. THAT IS JUST THE START OF THE ENGINE PROBLEMS. ONCE THE CAM SENSOR FAILS THE TIMING GETS OFFSET AND OVER TIME CAUSES THE VALVES TO GET BENT BY THE PISTONS, AFTER THAT IT'S BYE BYE HEADS AND NO CAR UNLESS YOU BUY A BETTER CAR.

WHEN I WROTE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T FIX IT OR REPLACE IT BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF ITS THREE-YEAR WARRANTY (THE CAR IS JUST UNDER FOUR YEARS OLD AND HAS ROUGHLY 54,000 MILES ON IT).  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR RESPONSE.    TODAY, I WAS IN MY CAR AND REACHED FOR MY WALLET.  A POPPING SOUND CAME FROM THE SEAT, AND IT RECLINED FULLY.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.  I HAVE CHECKED THE INTERNET AND HAVE COME UP WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER INSTANCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM, ONE WHERE A GENTLEMAN REACHED FOR HIS WALLET AND THE SEAT RECLINED   (HTTP://WWW.CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/AUTOMOTIVE/DODGE_AVENGER.HTM) AND ONE WHERE A GENTLEMAN WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND HIS SEAT RECLINED (HTTP://MEMBERS.AOL.COM/_HT_A/GRNCAMARO/OWNERSE8.HTM).

I HAD TO REPLACE MY BRAKES 6 MONTHS AFTER I GOT THE CAR CAUSED BY A VIBRATION FROM THE FRONT END AND HAVE REPLACED THEM A TOTAL OF 3 TIMES SINCE I GOT THE CAR. 1 YEAR AFTER I GOT THE CAR, HAD TO GET NEW TIRES PUT ON DUE TO WEARING OF THE TREADS AND LOSING AIR IN THE FRONT TIRES, AGAIN DUE TO THE VIBRATION, I PAID FOR THAT.

WHEN I OWNED THE INTREPID, WHICH WAS PURCHASED IN FEB. 2000, I BROUGHT IT IN TO THE DEALER WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO BE CHECKED BECAUSE THERE WAS A VIBRATION IN THE FRONT END, ESP. WHEN BRAKING WHILE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL.  I FELT THE ROTORS MIGHT BE WARPING.  AFTER PAYING A $25.00 INSPECTION FEE, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT HIS MECHANIC COULD NOT FIND ANY VIBRATION IN THE ROTORS.   I STATED THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DRIVE THE CAR DOWN A STEEP HILL.  THE MANAGER STATED THAT BRAKES WERE NOT COVERED AFTER 12,000 MILES ANYWAY.  A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A LOUD SQUEAL COMING FROM THE BRAKES WHEN STOPPING AT ANYTIME.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER.  I MENTIONED THAT THE VIBRATION WAS STILL HAPPENING AND THE TIRES, WHICH WERE NEW  WHEN THE CAR WAS PURCHASED, WERE GOING BALD BECAUSE OF UNEVEN BRAKING.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE MANUFACTURER PUTS ON BRAKE PADS MADE OF VERY HARD MATERIAL  WHICH CAUSES THE SQUEAL WHEN HOT.  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE ONLY REMEDY WOULD BE TO REPLACE THEIR PADS WITH GENERIC PADS FROM A BRAKE SHOP, AT MY EXPENSE.  I RAN INTO A FELLOW WHO SEEMED TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT CARS WHO TOLD ME THAT EXTRA HARD BRAKE PADS CAN CAUSE ROTORS TO WARP BECAUSE THEY GET EXTREMELY HOT WHEN BREAKING.  BUT HOW DO YOU PROVE THE MANUFACTURER HAS CAUSED THIS ROTOR DEFECT BY USING FAULTY BRAKE PADS?  NOW,  I HAVE PURCHASED A DODGE AVENGER IN FEB. 2001 (AS I STATED EARLIER) BECAUSE THE INTREPID WAS WRECKED.  THE  '99 AVENGER ALSO HAD APPROX. 13,500 MI. WHEN PURCHASED.  GUESS WHAT?...  THE AVENGER IS IN THE SHOP RIGHT NOW GETTING THE ROTORS GROUND DOWN BECAUSE OF VIBRATIONS.  THIS TIME, THE MECHANIC COULD FEEL THE VIBRATIONS BECAUSE WE RODE DOWN A HILL.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT HE HAD THE SAME ROTOR TROUBLE WITH HIS CHRYSLER SEBRING AT 11,000 MILES.  IT SEEMS THE CHRYS. CORP. SHOULD REMEDY THIS ROTOR SITUATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM IN MANY OF THEIR CARS.*AK",
