THEY WERE DRIVING VERY SLOWLY, AS THEY HAD JUST EXITED THEIR PARKING SPOT, AND THEN PROCEEDED AHEAD, AND WHILE DRIVING IN VERY SLOW MOTION WENT OVER A SMALL BUMP OR NODE, OR BARELY ANYTHING, IN THE ENUMCLAW HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT. THE AIRBAGS BOTH BLEW OUT SUDDENLY, SLIGHTLY INJURING MY 15 YEAR OLD SON'S HAND, AND BLINDING AND PUSHING THEM BOTH BACKWARD IN THEIR SEATS. BOTH OF THEM JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR IMMEDIATELY, VERY SCARED. THEY HAD BEEN DRIVING VERY SLOWLY, SO WERE ABLE TO STOP SUDDENLY DO THIS AND STILL SAFELY ENOUGH TO IMMEDIATELY GET OUT. MANY OF THE FOOTBALL BOYS WERE WATCHING, AS THEY WERE DRIVING RIGHT BY THEM, AND EVERYONE BROKE OUT IN EMOTION. ONE WITNESS CLAIMED THAT IT CAUSED THE WHEELS TO LIFT OFF THE GROUND. THEY DROVE HOME THAT DAY, WITH AIRBAGS OUT, BUT SINCE THEY HAVE QUITE DRIVING THE CAR, AS IT APPEARS TO BE ILLEGAL TO DRIVE IT WITHOUT AIRBAGS. NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS SITUATION, AND WE ARE LEFT FEELING SHORT OF ONE OF OUR NECESSARY VEHICLES.

STOP TO GET GAS AND UPON STARTING THE VEHICLE TO CONTINUE MY WAY HOME IT MADE LOUD POP AND THEN CONTINUED TO POP, POP, POP. AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD AN EXHAUST MANIFOLD PROBLEM, BUT UPON THE REPAIR SHOP INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE  THEY NOTED THAT THE NUMBER ONE SPARK PLUG HAD BLEW OUT OF THE PISTON. THEY REPAIRED IT FOR ABOUT $ THE SECOND TIME WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO WHEN THE NUMBER TWO SPARK PLUG (ALL THIS BEING ON THE DRIVERS SIDE) BLEW OUT. NO DAMAGE TO THE THREADS AND A NEW SET OF SPARK PLUGS WERE PUT INTO THE VEHICLE ALL AROUND. THEN ON SUNDAY EVENING, JULY 23RD 2006, THE SAME NUMBER 2 SPARK PLUG BLEW OUT AGAIN; THIS TIME TAKING ALL THE THREADS WITH IT. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MY PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND NOW I AM IN THE PROCESS OF FINDING A REPAIR SHOP TO RE-THREAD THE PISTON. I AM SURE THEY WILL HAVE TO GET A NEW COIL AS WELL; SINCE IT BROKE OFF AT THE PLACE OF WERE IT IS BOLTED TO THE HEAD.    I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY ON TUESDAY, JULY 25TH 2006 AND SPOKE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. AND BASICALLY WAS GIVEN A NOT OUR PROBLEM ATTITUDE. THIS IS APPALLING THAT SUCH A LARGE COMPANY AS FORD WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND FIX IT! I AM A SINGLE MOTHER AND CAN NOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY CAR FIXED AT OVER $3000.00! I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FORD AND WILL NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. I WAS A HUGE FORD FAN; WHEN ANYONE WOULD TRY TO DISCREDIT THEM I WOULD BACK THEM ALL THE WAY! NOT ANY MORE THEY DON'T BACK THEIR CUSTOMERS. I GUESS FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS NO LOYALTY TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHAT SO EVER! SO I SHALL NO LONGER BE LOYAL TO THEM. I WILL BE BUYING A CHEVY OR OTHER VEHICLE THAT HAS NO ASSOCIATION WITH THE FORD NAME, AS SOON AS THIS IS FIXED. SHE'S BEING TRADED IN ASAP! *JB",

        "summary": "THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON MY WAY TO WORK, ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY RESIDENCE. THE SEAT BACK JUST UNEXPECTEDLY FELL TO A FULL RECLINE AGAINST THE BACK SEAT. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR BACK TO MY RESIDENCE SO I COULD EVALUATE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I TRIED TO VISUALLY SEE IF I COULD IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM BY TRYING TO REPOSITION THE SEAT. I ENDED UP REMOVING THE BLACK PLASTIC COVER, WHICH IS FASTENED OVER THE LEVER/LATCH ASSEMBLY, TO EXPOSE THE INTERNAL MECHANISM OF THE LEVER/LATCH ASSEMBLY ON THE RECLINING SEAT BACK. UPON REMOVING THE PLASTIC COVER, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY A LOOSE BOLT IN THE MECHANISM. I WAS ABLE TO PULL THE BOLT OUT OF THE MECHANISM WITHOUT UNSCREWING IT. THE BOLT LITERALLY SLID STRAIGHT OUT. AS I INSPECTED THE LOCATION WHERE THE BOLT WAS SUPPOSED TO FASTEN INTO, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS STILL A REMAINING PORTION OF THE BOLT LEFT IN THE MECHANISM. THE BOLT, WHICH FASTENS THE LATCH/LEVER SYSTEM OF THE RECLINING (SEAT BACK) PORTION OF THE FRONT DRIVER'S SEAT, ESSENTIALLY SHEARED IN HALF. THIS CAUSED THE RECLINING (SEAT BACK) PORTION OF THE FRONT DRIVER'S SEAT TO FALL AWAY FROM ITS UPRIGHT POSITION. WITHOUT THE BOLT FASTENED INTO THE LATCH/LEVER ASSEMBLY WHICH ALLOWS DRIVER TO MANIPULATE POSITION OF SEAT BACK THE SEAT BACK IS NOT ABLE TO BE POSITIONED UPRIGHT, ULTIMATELY MAKING DRIVING IMPOSSIBLE. BASICALLY, THE SEAT BACK SWIVELS LOOSELY FROM THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE BACK SEAT AND CANNOT BE SET SECURELY IN AN UPRIGHT DRIVABLE POSITION. THE BOLT IN QUESTION IS A M10 WITH 1.5MM PITCH (METRIC 10), WHICH IS CLOSE IN SIZE TO A 3/8\u001d STANDARD BOLT. I HAVE ONLY OWNED THE CAR FOR 5 YEARS AND 4 MONTHS (I PURCHASED IT IN APRIL OF 1999). THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY AND OR DEATH. THE LOCAL RCHASED THE VEHICLE WOULD DO NOTHING TO HELP ME REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AND DID NOTHING TO RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS KIND OF FAILURE. I WAS FORCED TO FIX THE SEAT ON MY OWN. *AK",

IF THE CAR IS IN DRIVE OR REVERSE AND  I DO NOT HAVE MY FOOT FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE, THE CAR WILL JUMP FORWARD OR BACKWARD. I NOTICE THE PROBLEM MOSTLY WHEN I FIRST PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE. IT MAY HAPPEN 3 OR 4 TIMES IN ONE MONTH AND MAY NOT HAPPEN AGAIN FOR 2 OR 3 MONTHS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BRAKE APPLIED FIRMLY, I THINK THE CAR COULD EASILY JUMP 5 FEET BEFORE GETTING A FOOT ON THE BRAKE. I CURRENTLY HAVE 29,000 MILES ON MY CAR. I PURCHASED IT NEW IN THE MIDDLE OF 1999. THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW. DURING A PREVIOUS IN WARRANTY REPAIR, I TOLD THE DEALER ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THAT SOMETIMES IT ALSO HAD A ROUGH IDLE. THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS DURING TESTING. NOW THE CAR HAS A SPORADIC COLD IDLE PROBLEM WHICH HAS GOTTEN WORSE. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS RELATED. I WOULD GUESS THE \"RAPID RPM INCREASE AT IDLE PROBLEM\" HAS OCCURED BETWEEN 25 AND 50 TIMES WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS BUMPING THE GAS PEDAL. AFTER REPEAT OCCURENCES I STARTED PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. MY FOOT NEVER TOUCHED THE GAS PEDAL WHEN THE CAR JUMPED UNPREDICTABLY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAR. FOR THE MOST PART, I AM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER OF FORD MOTOR CO. HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM CONCERNS ME GREATLY FROM A POINT OF SAFETY BECUASE PEDESTRIANS COULD BE WALKING IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND THE CAR WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.",

FROM READING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TIRE, THIS TIRE DESIGN IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF HYDROPLANING RESISTANCE.  AS AN AUTOMOTIVE ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH MANY, MANY YEARS OF OPERATING HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLES, I AM TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN.  THE TIRE SEEMS TO HAVE SIGNIFCANT LATERAL GRIPPING CAPABILITY BOTH IN WET AND DRY CONDITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE DEEP, LATERAL CENTER CHANNEL SEEMS TO MAKE THIS TIRE UNSAFE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PERFECTLY SMOOTH HIGHWAY.  THIS GROOVE \"GRABS\" ANY PERFECTIONS IN THE ROADWAY THAT ARE PARALLEL TO THE ACTUAL ROAD SURFACE AND WILL ACTUALLY \"SNATCH\" THE STEERING WHEEL FROM THE GRIP OF THE DRIVER.  ANYTHING IN THE ROADWAY SUCH AS \"OVERPAVINGS\" WHICH CREATE PARALLEL RIDGES, HEAVY TRUCK TRAFFIC LANE DEPRESSIONS IN THE ROAD SURFACE WILL DO LIKEWISE.  WHILE NOT A DESIGN ENGINEER, IT APPEARS THAT THIS GROOVE DOWN THE CENTER MIMICS A TRAIN WHEEL ON THE TRACK.  THE TRAIN CAN ONLY FOLLOW THE TRACK DUE TO THE TRACK INSELF BEING INSERTED INTO THE TRAIN WHEEL.  ANY IMPERFECTION IN THE ROADWAY THAT IS PARALLEL TO THE DIRECTION OF THE HIGHWAY AND THE ROTATION OF THE TIRE CREATES A REMARKABLY SIMILAR SENSATION.
