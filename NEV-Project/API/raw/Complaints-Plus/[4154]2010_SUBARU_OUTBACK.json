WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS A SHAMEFUL NEGLECT ON SUBARU'S PART SINCE THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INCIDENTS THE SAME AS MINE.

I WAS ABLE TO USE MY PADDLE SHIFTERS TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN TO A SAFER SPEED. AFTER THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR, I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT HAD COME ON. LUCKILY I WAS CLOSE TO HOME AND WAS ABLE TO LIMP THE CAR BACK HOME WHERE THE CAR HAS SAT UNABLE TO BE DRIVEN.     THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING RECALL (SUBARU #214790, NHTSA# 14V311000) FOR 05-09 OUTBACK MODELS. ALTHOUGH MY VIN SAYS IT'S A 2010, IT TAKES 2009 BRAKE PADS (2010 PADS WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE) SO I SUSPECT IT'S AN EARLY 2010 MODEL WITH SOME 2009 PARTS- SPECIFICALLY THE BRAKING SYSTEM. OUR HOUSEHOLD HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM FIXED ON 5 DIFFERENT SUBARUS  (92 OUTBACK, 95 OUTBACK, 98 OUTBACK, 02 OUTBACK, 09 LEGACY) SO WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. THIS FAILED IN EXACTLY THE SAME SPOT PHOTOS ATTACHED OF THE BLOWN BRAKE LINES. I CONTACTED MY DEALER THE DAY IT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID THERE ARE NO OPEN RECALLS FOR THIS FOR MY MODEL YEAR- EVEN AFTER I EXPLAINED THE DIFFERENT SIZE BRAKE PADS.  THEY SUGGESTED I CONTACT SUBARU AMERICA- WHICH I DID ON SEPT 4. THEY SAID THE SAME THING AS THE DEALER, SUGGESTED I CALL SUBARU CORPORATE (THEY WERE CLOSED) BUT CAUTIONED ME THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HELP. I THINK THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE AT LEAST THE 2010 MODEL.  I'M TRYING THE NHTSA BECAUSE IT'S A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM THAT OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING. THE NEXT PERSON THIS HAPPENS TO MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.     IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP? I'M LOOKING FOR THIS TO BE FIXED ON MY CAR AND THE RECALL TO BE EXTENDED TO OTHER CARS WITH THIS DESIGN FLAW.

NOW MY PUDDLE LIGHTS HAVE FAILED AND THE SHORT MAKES IT SO MANY MORE FEATURES IN MY CAR DO NOT WORK (INTERIOR LIGHTS, GAUGES AND KEY FOB (CURRENTLY USE THE SAME FUSE). FOR SOME REASON MY VIN DOES NOT SHOW ON THE RECALL LOOK UP, BUT IT FITS THE VIN RANGE AS WELL AS MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SUBARU CAN SKIRT THE RECALL, IF THE PUDDLE LIGHTS WERE INSTALLED AT THE DEALERSHIP AT TIME OF PURCHASE AND NOT AT THE FACTORY (SAME PART, AUTHORIZED SERVICE DEPARTMENT, NEW CAR)? THIS APPEARS TO BE THE CASE.TO DATE, SUBARU USA HAS OFFERED TO PAY HALF THE COST THE REPAIR ($881) IN THE INTEREST OF 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION' AND NOT PER THE RECALL (SR1-30211430901). MY LOCAL MICHAEL'S SUBARU IN BELLEVUE WASHINGTON (SERVICE ADVISOR [XXX]) HAS NOT OFFERED ANYTHING AND HAD MADE FEW EFFORTS, IF ANY, TO CONTACT ME WITH STATUS. I FEEL THE BELLEVUE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DROPPED THE BALL 5 YEARS AGO WHEN IT WOULD GAVE BEEN EASIER TO ADDRESS (NEW RECALL AND NEWER CAR - 67,000 MILES). THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTED IN DECEMBER 2017 WHEN THE KEY FOB STOPPED WORKING. THAT WAS TRACKED TO A SHORT IN ONE OF THE PUDDLE LIGHTS. I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THIS PART SHOULD BE COVERED BY A RECALL AND IF THIS MIGHT ALSO BE RELATED TO THE MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY ACT EVEN THOUGH THUS A A RECALL.

CAR WILL UNEXPECTEDLY SHUDDER THEN ENGINE WILL QUIT AT LOW RPMS EITHER COMING TO A STOP OR UPON INITIAL ACCELERATION FROM A STOP. SYMPTOMS MIMIC A MANUAL TRANSMISSION CLUTCH SLIPPING/STALLING. ENGINE OPERATING TEMPERATURE HAS NO EFFECT, NOR VEHICLE TURNING, OR VARYING ELECTRICAL LOADS. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS IT CAN HAPPEN WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC (FOR EXAMPLE) AND IT HAPPENS REPEATEDLY, UNEXPECTEDLY AND RANDOMLY. I URGE THE NHTSA IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS TO ISSUE MANDATORY RECALL AND REPAIR ORDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE AND SERIOUS INJURY.  I AM AWARE OF MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF THIS PROBLEM. SUBARU HAS ISSUED TSB 16-90-13 WHICH ADDRESSES FAULTY PART REPLACEMENT IN TRANSMISSION TORQUE CONVERTER WITH A NEWLY REDESIGNED PART. HOWEVER,  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, OWNERS ARE NOT BEING NOTIFIED OF THIS SERIOUS SAFETY SITUATION, NOR IS SUBURU REPLACING THE PART FREE OF CHARGE IF THE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.I HAVE BEEN QUOTED $1200-$ 2000 DOLLARS FOR REPAIRS BY SUBARU. IT IS MY CONCERN THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR, EVEN IF THE OWNERS ARE NOTIFIED BY A VOLUNTARY TSB, THEY MAY NOT GO TO THE EXPENSE TO HAVE IT REPAIRED, RESULTING IN POTENTIAL LOSS OF LIFE AND INJURIES. THIS NEEDS TO BE A MANDATORY RECALL. AS AN ASIDE, I AM AN AIRLINE CAPTAIN AND A FAA CERTIFIED MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN WITH OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN MAINTENANCE RELATED SAFETY ISSUES, AND IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS SITUATION REQUIRES URGENT ACTION ON BEHALF OF NHTSA AND SUBARU.

THIS VIBRATION CAN SOMETIMES BE DRAMATIC THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, AND CAUSES ERRATIC DRIVABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN ADVERSE CONDITIONS.  THIS VIBRATION MAY ALSO CAUSE PREMATURE WEAR ON FRONT TIRES, STEERING AND SUSPENSION COMPONENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO FAILURE AND INJURY, ESPECIALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.

THIS  DID SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  IF THIS PROBLEM IS RESEARCHED ON POPULAR AND RESPECTABLE AUTOMOTIVE WEB SITES, ONE CAN FIND THAT IT HAS BEEN AFFECTING A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF 2010 SUBARU OUTBACKS AND TO DATE, NO OWNERS HAVE HAD THEIR ISSUE RESOLVED BY SUBARU OF AMERICA.  MANY OTHER OWNERS REPORTED SUBARU OF AMERICA REPLACING WHAT WERE CONSIDERED \"DEFECTIVE\" CONTINENTAL TIRES, WITH ANOTHER SET OF EXACT TIRES FROM CONTINENTAL.  I AM WORRIED THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH EXPOSURE AND MAY TAKE AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT FOR ANYONE TO SERIOUSLY TAKE NOTICE.   I HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE CASE OPEN WITH SUBARU, BUT IT IS EVIDENT FROM MY REPEATED CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THAT THEY ARE BEING EVASIVE WITH WHERE THEY ARE IN FIXING THIS ISSUE, AND I HAVE NOW BECOME DEEPLY CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY.
