To better explain the clock display time can not be changed either and it was explained to me to be  controlled by gps system but since software is not recognized or updated those issues can not be corrected.

AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, WHAT EVER THEY USE TO HOLD THE HOOD UP ON THE VEHICLES THAT THEY PRODUCE SHOULD NEVER FAIL.

IT SEEMS TO BE OF THE OPINION OF HONDA THAT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE REPLACED IN TIME. I THINK THEY ARE VERY WRONG.

SO, NOTHING IS PRESSING A GAS PEDAL, AND THE ENGINE PULLING LIKE CRAZY, CAR IS ACCELERATING, AND HIGHWAY IS OVER IN 5 SECONDS. I TOUCH A GAS PEDAL - IT IS SOFT, BUT IT'S SPRINGING BACK WHEN I RELEASE IT, AND THERE IS NO A BOTTLE OR A CARPET STUCK IN BETWEEN, I CHECK CRUSE CONTROL - IT IS NOT ON, SO I PRESS BRAKES AND TRY TO SLOW DOWN THE CAR WITH BRAKES WHICH IS NOT EASY BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS STILL RUNNING ON MAX RPMS AND PULLING A CAR, YOU CAN FEEL IT. SO, I STOP EVENTUALLY AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE.    THE NEXT DAY I CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD FOR THE PROBLEM, AND I DISCOVERED THE NEXT. THERE IS A PART OF A CAR CALLED A THROTTLE, THAT REGULATES AIR INTAKE IN THE ENGINE, AND THIS WAY SPEED OF ENGINE IS REGULATED TOO. THE THROTTLE IS REGULATED BY TWO CABLES. ONE CABLE (NOT A WIRE) GOES FROM A GAS PEDAL, AND IT'S ATTACHED TO A METAL BRACKET ON A THROTTLE. ANOTHER CABLE (NOT A WIRE) GOES FROM CRUISE CONTROL, AND IT'S ATTACHED TO A PLASTIC BRACKET ON A THROTTLE. SO, PLASTIC DETERIORATED OVER TIME, AND CRUISE CONTROL CABLE BROKE OFF AND JAMMED THE THROTTLE ON THE MAX OPENING WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.    I THINK HONDA HAS TO DO A RECALL TO FIX THIS SITUATION BECAUSE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN SOMETHING BRAKES IN YOUR CAR AND YOU CANNOT START A CAR, OR WHEN SOMETHING STARTS SQUEAKING OR RATTLING, AND YOU HAVE TIME TO GO TO A MECHANIC TO FIX IT - IT'S ONE STORY, BUT WHEN YOU DRIVE AND YOU CAR ACCELERATES ON IT'S OWN - IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.",

MAY 2015 TRAVELING 20 TO 25 MPH, PASSENGER LOWER BALL JOINT SEPARATED CAUSING WHEEL TO TURN SIDEWAYS IN WHEEL WELL, RESULTED IN DISABLING VEHICLE AND DAMAGE TO FENDER.

THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THIS WOULD BE TO REDESIGN THE FRONT SUSPENSION STEERING KNUCKLE AND LOWER CONTROL ARM.

MY CAR, THOUGH 11 YEARS OLD, HAD ONLY 89.5K MILES ON IT.  IT HAD BEEN SERVICED AT ALL TIMES BY MY HONDA DEALER, INCLUDING TRANSMISSION SERVICE 3 TIMES, INCLUDING JANUARY OF 2015.

I \"ESCALATED\" MY COMPLAINT TO AMERICAN HONDA AND WAS OFFERED $250 \"CUSTOMER LOYALTY CARD\" WHICH I INITIALLY DECLINED.  I THEN CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA AGAIN AND RECEIVED A $300 CARD FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THAT WHEN MY CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME BY HONDA THE ENTIRE AIR INTAKE SYSTEM WAS MISSING!!  IT TOOK THE HONDA DEALERSHIP 3 DAYS T CONTACT ME AND RETURN THE AIR INTAKE SYSTEM.  I BOUGHT THIS HONDA ACCORD BRAND NEW FROM THE HONDA DEALER AND AM THE ONLY OWNER/DRIVER.

THE ANSWER WAS \"ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS YOUR VIN IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL\". WELL, I DID SOME RESEARCH AS MY VEHICLE WAS HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL. NHTSA RECALL NUMBER 04V-176 HAS RELATED DOCUMENTS ON FILE AND ONE OF THEM BEING A LETTER DATED JUNE 28 2004 FROM AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO. INC. SIGNED BY A WILLIAM R. WILLEN. THIS LETTER CLEARLY IDENTIFIES MY CAR AS BEING INCLUDED IN THE SAFETY RELATED RECALL AND I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF RECALL IN LATE 2004. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE. SOME HOW MY CAR EXPERIENCED NO ISSUES UNTIL 2015, BUT THE ISSUES DID EVENTUALLY SHOW UP. NOW TODAY MY CAR WAS FAILING TO ACCELERATE ON THE HIGHWAY AND ALSO TRYING TO DOWNSHIFT TO LOW GEARS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND THEN SUDDENLY FAILED TO DRIVE AT ALL.  WE HAD SOME INDICATIONS IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS AND HAD THE TRANSMISSION DRAINED AND FILLED 4 TIMES TO TRY TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM. I TALKED WITH TWO CERTIFIED HONDA MECHANICS WHO BOTH TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION WAS GOING TO FAIL AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE. WELL, THEY WERE RIGHT, BUT HERE I AM IN THIS SITUATION NOW BECAUSE HONDA FAILED TO RECALL MY CAR IN 2004 AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. FOR YEARS NOW WE HAVE UNKNOWINGLY BEEN DRIVING A CAR THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL AND CRASH. HONDA DID NOT FULFILL THEIR DUTIES IN THIS RECALL.

WHEN IT REACHES NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE, THE MOTOR STARTS REVVING, EVEN IN D.  THIS HAS HAPPENED WHILE AT A STOP AND ON A HIGHWAY.  WHEN I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE CAR HAD ALREADY WARMED UP, THE ENGINE REVVED AND THEN SUDDENLY JERKED BACK.  THE FEELING IS LIKE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION CAR DOWNSHIFTING WITHOUT PRESSING ON THE GAS; IT JERKS THEN DECELERATES.  AND FROM THERE IT JUST REVS AND REVS, LIKE IT'S NOT CATCHING THE GEARS.  SO I HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY A FEW TIMES, THANKS TO THIS NON-WORKING TRANSMISSION.  WHEN THIS OCCURS ON THE SMALL ROADS, I WOULD THEN HAVE TO PULL OVER AND TURN OFF THE CAR.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, THE CAR WILL ENGAGE INTO GEAR AGAIN, BUT NOT FOR LONG.  THIS IS A PROBABLE SIGN OF OVERHEATING WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH CAN PROBABLY CAUSE THE TRANNY TO SLIP?  NOT 100% SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT A MECHANIC.

        "summary": "THE SRS LIGHT OF MY 04 HONDA ACCORD HAS BEEN ON SINCE LATE 2011. SINCE IT'S A LONG DRIVE, I ADJUSTED THE POSITION OF MY DRIVER'S SEAT TO MAKE MYSELF COMFORTABLE. SOMEHOW, THE SRS LIGHT STARTED TO TURN ON AND IT HAS BEEN ON EVER SINCE, INDICATING THE AIRBAG MIGHT BE DEACTIVATED.    I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND REALIZED IT'S A WELL-KNOWN ISSUE RELATED TO DRIVER'S SEAT POSITION SENSOR HARNESS. HONDA ANNOUNCED A SAFETY RECALL BACK IN JANUARY 2007 TO FIX THIS ISSUE FOR SOME VEHICLES OF CERTAIN MODELS. THE MODEL I HAVE WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL BUT NOT THE PARTICULAR VEHICLE I HAVE. I CONTACTED HONDA FOR EXPLANATION AND THEY INSISTED IT BE MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THIS DIAGNOSED AND FIXED. MANY HONDA OWNERS  INCLUDING MYSELF JUST NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL NOTICE THAT WE THINK WE DESERVE. RELATING THIS TO THE RECENT HONDA SCANDAL OF UNDER-REPORTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIED IN HONDA VEHICLES, IT COULD BE A SIMILAR SCHEME OF PRACTICE OF UNDER ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE RECALL.    I FINALLY GOT A RECALL NOTICE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO REGARDING THE AIRBAG INFLATOR ISSUE AND I THOUGHT BOTH THE SRS AND INFLATOR ISSUES WOULD BE FIXED WITH A SINGLE SERVICE. I WAS WRONG AND THE DEALER ONLY TOOK CARE OF THE INFLATOR NOT THE SRS. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY IGNORED MY COMPLAINT ONCE AGAIN.    I HOPE FEDERAL REGULATORS CAN INVESTIGATE THIS CASE AND I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE. LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN LOST DUE TO NON-OPENING HONDA AIRBAGS.I BELIEVE IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM. PLEASE SEE THE LINK BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.  HTTP://WWW.HONDAPROBLEMS.COM/TRENDS/AIRBAGS/.  *TR",

ON JAN 3, 2015, SHE CALLED THE SERVICE DEPT AND WAS PASSED AROUND TO APPROXIMATELY 4-5 DIFFERENT PEOPLE/DEPARTMENTS, NONE OF WHOM ACTED LIKE THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO OR WHO TO TRANSFER HER TO. SHE WAS TOLD TO LEAVE A MESSAGE, WHICH SHE DID, AND SHE WAS STILL NOT CALLED BACK. I THEN CALLED THE SERVICE DEPT AND ASKED FOR THE MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHO I WAS AND WHO I WAS CALLING FOR AND ABOUT AND WAS TOLD THEY HAD NO RECORD OF THE INITIAL REQUEST IN OCT 2014 AND NO RECORD OF ANY PARTS BEING ORDERED. I WAS ASSURED THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART WOULD BE ORDERED IMMEDIATELY AND SHE WOULD BE CONTACTED TO SET UP AN APPT. IT IS NOW FEB 3, 2015 AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING. WE RECEIVED THE 1ST SAFETY RECALL NOTICE REGARDING THE AIRBAG ISSUE IN THE MAIL TODAY AND NOW THERE IS A 2ND RECALL ON THE SAME AIRBAG(S). I AM CONTACTING THE SERVICE DEPT AGAIN TOMORROW, BUT THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, ON BOTH HONDA'S PART AND ON PAT PECK HONDA'S PART. THE FACT THAT TAKATA IS THE ONLY MANUFACTURER OF THIS AIRBAG IS ALSO HIGHLY CONCERNING, BOTH IN THEIR DENIAL TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND IN THEIR LACK OF CONCERN. HONDA HAS ALWAYS HAD A GREAT REPUTATION AND HIGH RESALE VALUE, BUT THIS WILL BE THE LAST HONDA WE OWN. THIS IS NOT A MINOR SAFETY ISSUE AND I HAPPEN TO VALUE MY 22 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S LIFE A LITTLE MORE THAN HONDA DOES.......THAT POINT HAS BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR. THERE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN AN OFFER MADE TO DISCONNECT THE AIRBAG, WHICH IS WHAT WE WILL HAVE DONE, IF THESE ARE NOT REPLACED IMMEDIATELY. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE................  *TR",

RIDICULOUS THAT THEY ONLY INCLUDE CERTAIN VIN #'S WHEN IT'S THE SAME TRANS IN ALL THESE CARS. I REALLY LOVE MY ACCORD, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY HONDA IS HANDLING THIS.

RESEARCH ON THE CAR SHOWED 2 FULL TRANSMISSION FLUSHES (~37K & 61K) BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATED FLUID. OUR OWNER'S MANUAL RECOMMENDS THE FIRST SERVICE BE PERFORMED AT 120,000 MILES. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS CAR HAD ANY CORRECTIONS MADE ON THE INITIAL RECALL CUSTOMER LETTER FROM THE SUMMER OF 2004.

WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE BASED ON PREVIOUS HISTORY SO ON 02/25/2004 I WROTE A LETTER TO AMERICAN MOTOR HONDA COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. STATING THE FACTS AND REQUESTING A REPLY. I DID RECEIVE A LETTER ON 03/20/2004 REQUESTING THAT I CALL A CERTAIN NUMBER WITHIN 10 DAYS (ACTUALLY 2 WORK DAYS) OTHERWISE THEY WILL CONSIDER THE MATTER CLOSED. THE LETTER WAS DATED 03/14/2004.

THIS DAY, AFTER TURNING ON THE HEADLIGHTS THE PANEL DID NOT ILLUMINATE AND HAS NEVER THERE AFTER ILLUMINATED SINCE THAT DATE.

AFTER HAVING DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE FUSE LAYOUT I SEARCHED ONLINE FOR HELP AND THAT IS WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT MANY OTHER HONDA OWNERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND THAT IT IN FACT IS NOT A PROBLEM CAUSED BY A SIMPLE FUSE. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AT NIGHT DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND THE DEFROST BUTTON ON THE PANEL WHEN IT IS NOT ILLUMINATED AND ON RAINY NIGHTS OR OTHER NIGHTS WHEN THE DEFROST IS NEEDED BE VERY OBSTRUCTIVE TO THE CLEAR VISIBILITY OF THE DRIVER OF THEY CAN NOT ACCESS THE DEFROST WHEN NEEDED.

HONDA ADMITTED THAT IT HAD A PROBLEM AND SO THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANT PERIOD, BUT THIS PROBLEM APPEARED IRREGULARLY. FOR ME, JUST AFTER PASSING THE WARRANT PERIOD THEY SAID (100K).  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED.  I FOUND A LOT OF COMPLAINTS AND SAME ISSUES IN THE INTERNET.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND ASK HONDA TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WHATEVER THEIR WARRANT PERIOD.

I WAS ON THE DRIVER SEAT AND MY WIFE ON THE PASSENGER SEAT WITH HER DOOR ALSO WIDE OPEN. I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE WITH MY FACE TURNED TOWARDS HER WHILE THE CAR WARMED UP.

OUR HOUSE KEY AND THE CAR KEY WERE ON THE SAME KEY CHAIN AND I WAS HANDING IT TO MY WIFE TO LOCK THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE. RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT, THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG VIOLENTLY EXPLODED WITH FULL FORCE AND WITH A VERY LOUD BANG WHIPPING MY FACE AND MY LEFT EAR. WHATEVER I HAD IN MY HANDS (MY WALLET, A CD AND THE CAR KEYS) WERE ALL BLOWN AWAY AND LANDED OUTSIDE THE CAR AND I WAS COMPLETELY DEAFENED AND DISORIENTED BY THE BLOW AND THE LOUD EXPLOSION. FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS OR SO, I WAS HURTING IN MY LEFT EAR AND WAS UNABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING WITH THAT EAR. ITS BEEN MORE THAN 24 HOURS SINCE THAT INCIDENT AND MY EAR THOUGH NOT HURTING AS MUCH, STILL HAS SOME RINGING.      I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR COMPANY BUT AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THEIR HANDLING OF THIS SITUATION.

THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR ANY EXPENSES WHATSOEVER THAT I MAY INCUR WITH REGARDS TO THIS INCIDENT INCLUDING MEDICAL CHECK-UP.

I WAITED FOR SEVERAL TRAFFIC LIGHT CYCLES, UNABLE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE AND AMID IMPATIENT DRIVERS' CAR HORNS FROM BEHIND ME.

THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND HAS HAD ALL OF ITS SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTIONS (WITH RECORDS).  THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO REPAIR SHOP AND WE WERE INFORMED THE CAR'S TRANSMISSION IS BAD.  THE CAR HAS 121,000 MILES.  THERE WAS A RECALL FOR TRANSMISSION ISSUES WITH THIS CAR YEAR MODEL THAT INCLUDED CARS MANUFACTURED TO JANUARY 8, 2004.  OUR CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN JANUARY 2004 AND NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  WE HAVE YET TO HAVE THE CAR REPAIRED BECAUSE OF THE INSANELY HIGH REPAIR COST.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICED SEVERAL INTERNET SITES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REFERRING TO HONDA TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  I AM THANKFUL THAT I DIDN'T WRECK THE CAR, BUT NOW THE CAR IS SITTING IN OUR DRIVEWAY NOT DRIVE-ABLE.  OBVIOUSLY, NOW I WONDER IF MY CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.

DUE TO THE VIOLENCE AND CONFUSION OF THE DEPLOYMENT EXPLOSION, I FIRST THOUGHT THAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY VEHICLE MUST HAVE BEEN CRUSHED IN A COLLISION WITH AN UNSEEN SEMI-TRAILER TRUCK.  EARS RINGING FROM THE CONCUSSION, I INITIALLY FOUGHT TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE, BUT SOON REALIZED THAT THE TIRES WERE STILL INTACT.  AS THE SMOKE CLEARED, I SAW THAT THE NEAREST VEHICLES WERE 100+ YARDS AHEAD OR BEHIND MY VEHICLE.  AT THE NEXT EXIT, I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE UNDER A STREET LIGHT.  THERE WAS NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR.  DURING LATER INSPECTIONS BY AN INSURANCE ADJUSTOR AND THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, NO CAUSE FOR DEPLOYMENT WAS FOUND.  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND HENCE NO EVIDENCE THAT AN OBJECT HIT THE UNDERCARRIAGE TO TRIGGER THE DEPLOYMENT.  THE ONLY EXTERNAL DAMAGE WAS A SMALL GOLF-BALL SIZED DENT IN THE ROOF OVER THE RIGHT CENTER PILLAR.  THE DENT WAS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY THE STRONG TORQUE THAT THE DEPLOYING SIDE-CURTAIN AIRBAG APPLIED TO THE WELDED ROOF MOUNT TO WHICH THE AIR BAG PACKAGE BOLTS.  HENCE, ALL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE (>$3000 USD) WAS CAUSED BY THE FALSE AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT ITSELF.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A COLLISION AND REFUSED TO COVER THE DAMAGES.  THE HONDA DEALERSHIP SIMILARLY REFUSED TO COVER THE DAMAGE SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE DEALERSHIP FURTHER CLAIMED THAT THE AIR BAG CONTROLLERS DO NOT SAVE THE STATE OF THE SENSORS WHEN A DEPLOYMENT IS TRIGGERED, AND HENCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DIAGNOSE FAILURES.  I FIND IT DISTURBING THAT SO-CALLED 'SAFETY' EQUIPMENT IN A PROPERLY MAINTAINED VEHICLE CAN SELF-DESTRUCT AND POTENTIALLY KILL THE OCCUPANT AND NEITHER THE INSURANCE COMPANY NOR THE MANUFACTURER TAKES ANY RESPONSIBILITY. *TR",

I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AUGUST 28, 2009 REGARDING THE PROBLEM I WAS EXPERIENCING WITH THE 2004 ACCORD AND THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER TO DIAGNOSE, AND IF IN FACT THE PART NUMBER AND CONDITION WERE THE SAME AS THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WITH THE 2003 THEY WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND TAKE CARE OF IT. I WAS ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER N012009-082801597.    ON SEPT 9, 2009 I WAS ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH PERFORMANCE HONDA DEALERSHIP TO DIAGNOSE AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  TOM RILEY FROM THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT (MANAGER) TRIED TO CONTACT AMERICAN HONDA REGARDING THE PROBLEM AND THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, ALTHOUGH IT WAS THE EXACT SAME PART NUMBER (76505-SDA) THAT IS FAILING IN THE 2003 MODEL AND THE EXACT SAME CONDITION OF FAILURE THEY HAVE SEEN IN THE 2003 MODELS.

BACKGROUND:    MY HONDA ACCORD WAS RECALLED UNDER THIS NTSB RECALL (HONDA RECALL 04-037 SPEED SENSOR 3RD GEAR INSPECTION):    AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION RECALLS AND DEFECTS FOUND ON 2004 HONDA ACCORD POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AUTOMOBILES. THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IS AUTHORIZED TO ORDER THE 2004 HONDA ACCORD POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MANUFACTURERS TO RECALL AND REPAIR VEHICLES OR PARTS OF MOTOR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT WHEN ITS INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THEY CONTAIN SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECTS IN THEIR STRUCTURE, OR PERFORMANCE.     TO REMEDY THE RECALL HONDA PERFORMED A CAMERA VISUAL INSPECTION AND SPRAYED ?LUBRICANT? INTO THE TRANSMISSION.      ON SEPTEMBER 15TH 2008, MY WIFE OBSERVED AN ?ENGINE LIGHT? ON THE DASH.  WE IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE VEHICLE WITH APPROXIMATELY 88,000 MILES BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.   I INITIALLY DIRECTED THE WORK TO BEGIN.  I THEN CALLED BACK TO ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO HOLD ON THE REPAIRS AND ASKED HIM TO WAIT AND INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVES.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY HAD BEEN EXTENDED, THAT THERE WAS A RECALL AND THAT AN 88K CAR SHOULD BE COVERED.      I VERIFIED THAT THE WARRANTY FOR MOST HONDA ACCORD V6'S HAD BEEN EXTENDED. I THEN CALLED BACK TO HONDA AND WAS TOLD AT 130PM THAT THE LIGHT RESET AND THERE WAS NO NEED FOR REPAIR AND THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER, MR. ORTIZ WOULD NOT PURSUE WARRANTY REPAIR OF THE TRANSMISSION.    2.  MY CONCERN IS THAT MY TRANSMISSION HAS SECONDARY INDICATIONS OF PENDING TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  WHEN THE SERVICE MANAGER REALIZED THAT THIS WAS A WARRANTY ISSUE, HE WAS WILLING TO SEND THE TRANSMISSION, WITH A LIKELY PENDING FAILURE BACK ON THE ROAD AND NOT COMPLYING WITH THE NTSB RECALL.  ACCORDING TO THE RECALL THERE IS A PROBABILITY OF CATASTROPHIC TRANSMISSION FAILURE AND CRASH. ESTIMATED VEHICLES AFFECTED: 1099796.  *TR",

FINALLY AT 95K THE PROBLEM COULD BE EASILY DETECTED BY THE MECHANICS AND THEY WANTED TO TRY SOME SIMPLE CHANGES. FIRST THE MECHANICS TRIED FUEL INJECTOR CLEANERS. AT 97K THE MECHANICS TRIED CHANGING THE ERG OR EKG VALVE. AT 99K THE MECHANIC CHANGED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTED HEAT SHIELD AND CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS. THE PROBLEM CONTINUE AT 101K THE MECHANIC NOW TELLS ME THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT I SHOULD THINK ABOUT REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE WEAR OF THE GEARS CAN CAUSE A TOOTH TO CHIP OR GEAR BREAKAGE WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE GEAR FAILURE.

WHEN I AM DRIVE AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 25 MPH THE CAR TREMBLES/SHAKES MOMENTARILY AND THEN CONTINUES TO GAIN SPEED. IF I CONTINUE DRIVING AT ABOUT 25 MPH THE CAR TREMBLES/SHAKES MOMENTARILY WITHOUT WARNING. THE SAME ISSUE WITH TREMBLING AND SHAKING HAPPENS ALSO WHEN I DRIVE THE CAR AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 40 MPH. THIS ISSUE DOES NOT OCCUR AT ANY OTHER DRIVING SPEED RANGES. THE SECOND GEAR IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MOMENTARILY TREMBLED THE CAR. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE GEAR FAILURE AND TRANSMISSION LOCKUP RESULTING IN A CRASH.    THE DRIVING TREMBLE PROBLEM STARTED HAPPENING AT ABOUT 50K MILES. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPLICATED SO IT WAS NOT REPAIRED. I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK AT 75K, 80K, 85K, 90K. FINALLY AT 95K THE PROBLEM COULD BE EASILY DETECTED BY THE MECHANICS AND THEY WANTED TO TRY SOME SIMPLE CHANGES. FIRST THE MECHANICS TRIED FUEL INJECTOR CLEANERS. AT 97K THE MECHANICS TRIED CHANGING THE ERG OR EKG VALVE. AT 99K THE MECHANIC CHANGED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTED HEAT SHIELD AND CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS. THE PROBLEM CONTINUE AT 101K THE MECHANIC NOW TELLS ME THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT I SHOULD THINK ABOUT REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE WEAR OF THE GEARS CAN CAUSE A TOOTH TO CHIP OR GEAR BREAKAGE WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE GEAR FAILURE. THE GEAR FAILURE CAN RESULT IN A TRANSMISSION LOCKUP, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH. I AM UPSET BECAUSE THE CAR TRANSMISSION WAS UNDER WARRANTY FROM 80K TO 100K MILES AND I HAD BOUGHT THE HONDA CARE WARRANTY. NOW IT IS PASSED 100K AND IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY I AM GIVEN THESE NEWS ABOUT FAILURE AND POSSIBLE CRASH. HONDA HAS A RECALL FOR 2004 HONDA ACCORD WITH THE EXACT PROBLEM MY CAR HAS.

I AM TEACHING OVERSEAS IN A DOD SCHOOL AND NEEDED TO GET A EUROPEAN HONDA DEALER TO FIX THE CAR. THEY SAID JUST CONTACT THE EUROPEAN DEALER. I DID AND AFTER 3 MONTHS SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PROPER BAG. THEY WOULD HAVE TO ORDER IT FROM THE USA. I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM AFTER TWO INQUIRIES. AGAIN I CALLED TORRANCE CALIFORNIA(AMERICAN HONDA HEADQUARTERS. THIS TIME JULY 2006, THE GIRL SAID, OH YES YOU DID CALL IN FEBRUARY. CAN I SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR. NO. SHE WOULD SEND IT TO A CASE MANAGER. ABOUT ONE WEEK LATER A MANAGER CALLS MY WIFE AT WORK AND TELLS HER THEY ONLY HAVE BROWN AND GREY AIR BAGS NO BLACK ONES IN THE ENTIRE USA. AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET THEM IN IF AT ALL. SHE SAID OUR CAR'S ENTIRE INTERIOR IS BLACK WE NEED TO HAVE BLACK TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY IN CASE WE HAVE TO SELL THE CAR. NO WAY IS THIS POSSIBLE. YOU CAN HAVE THE GREY OR TAKE A CHANCE ON THE ONE YOU HAVE BEING DEFECTIVE. THIS IS ABSURD. HOW CAN I GET THEM TO SEND ME THE AIRBAG AND I CAN WALK IT TO THE DEALER SO I CAN GET THIS FIXED SINCE THEY ARE UNABLE TO AND DO NOT CARE WHETHER IT GETS  DONE OR IF THERE IS ANY DANGER INVOLVED.  IT WAS PURCHASED AT SOUTHEASTERN HONDA IN FLORIDA.  2004 HONDA ACCORD LX SILVER WITH TOTALLY BLACK INTERIOR.  TRYING TO ARGUE WITH THIS GUY IS DIFFICULT FROM GERMANY.

THE SOUNDS SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM UNDER THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT  3) AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 60 MILES IN ONE GO IN WARM WEATHER(TEMPERATURES IN 80S), I HEAR A RUBBING/SQUEAKING NOISE WHEN MAKING TURNS. BECOMES MORE AUDIBLE WHEN WINDOWS ARE ROLLED DOWN. SOUNDS MORE LIKE TIRES RUBBING AGAINST THE BODY.  4) PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR IS SOAKING WET AND I ASSUME IT IS WATER.
