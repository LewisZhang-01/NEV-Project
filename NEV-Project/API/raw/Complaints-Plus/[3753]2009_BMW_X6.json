AS I WAS DOING SO THE EXPANSION TANK EXPLODED AND THE HOT WATER SHOT PAST ME AND JUST CAUGHT MY RIGHT SHOULDER. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF THIS CAUGHT ME DEAD ON I WOULD HAVE BEEN BURNED BADLY. I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY VEHICLE. THE DEALER ALSO TOLD ME TO CALL ANOTHER DEALER AS THEY MAY HAVE BETTER INFORMATION. I HAD THE EXPANSION TANK REPLACED AND THEY REPLACED THE COOLANT. THERE SEEMS TO BE A AIR POCKET IN THE ENGINE AND THE COOLANT NEEDS TO BE TOPPED OFF AFTER RUNNING THE ENGINE.
