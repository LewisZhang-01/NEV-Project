        "summary": "I purchased this vehicle from a private seller in August 2021 and attempted to obtain records of the vehicle Kia America Case ID #14353653 which Kia America has yet to provide me any information. I had a full diagnostic done by a certified mechanic at Borst Automotive in the state of Arizona on 09/18/21 where several concerns were reported to me that Kia failed to report. There is a new and concerning grinding with the engine on my 2006 Kia Sportage LX that sounds like it might be an exhaust leak.  I hear loud grinding sounds now when turning on the car that immediately sound when it is fired up, and when accelerating is the worst, but the sound starts loud and is immediate when I turn on the vehicle and fire up the engine. Two days ago on 10-01-21 which was the last night I drove it as it feels unsafe to drive now, I did not get far before the front driver's tire closest to the engine completely blew out/ and exploded coming off of it's wheel and cap hinting at a potential engine problem or recalled defect. I had to immediately pull over and call AAA to come put the spare donut on my car to get it back home to park. The engine appears to have something wrong with the exhaust system and it sounds bad. I reported this today to Kia America case ID #14407655. I always make it a point to to check fluids and something is not right here. The car is overheated but Radiator is fine and coolant, and all other engine fluids are full but could be an engine issue that is dangerous.  This engine sounds like it will burst at any minute its grinding and stalling so bad. Made an appointment with Royal Kia in my hometown Tucson, AZ for October 12, 2021 to have the fuel tank straps replaced and towed as apparently they are faulty and this was the soonest this dealership could perform this. I know the 2010-2021 Sportage models were recalled under Safety Recall 20V-750 but since this recall is somewhat new and yet to discover other Kia Sportage\u2019s that might also be affected. Consumer also noticed malfunctioning of brake and tail lights when pushing the brake pedal and without pushing on it. Taillight bulb had to be replace immediately when purchasing the vehicle.  Headlight/lamps were also faulty and replacement on the driver's side as well as replacement of the tire on the driver's side already occurred in the few short weeks consumer owned the vehicle.",
