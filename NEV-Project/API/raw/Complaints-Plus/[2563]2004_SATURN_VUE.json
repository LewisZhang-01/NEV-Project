WE ARE QUITE UPSET THAT WE ARE STUCK WITH A DESIGN DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION WITH NO RECOURSE BUT TO EITHER PAY FOR REPAIRS WHICH WE HAVE NO MONEY TO PAY, OR KEEP THE VEHICLE AND PAY $8000 IN FINANCE CHARGES FOR A CAR THAT CAN'T BE USED SAFELY, OR LET THE CAR GO TO THE FINANCE COMPANY IN A REPOSSESSION AND WRECK OUR CREDIT FOR 7 YEARS.

HOOKED UP TO A CODE READER, NO CODES APPEAR; HOWEVER, THE TORQUE CONVERTER IS SLIPPING AS IT DISPLAYS A READ OUT OF OVER 8,000 RPM'S WHEN THIS OCCURS AND THE TACHOMETER BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH WITH THE SHUDDER.  FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IS HIGHER IN HOTTER WEATHER AND WHEN CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  SLIGHT WHINE ALSO NOTICED BY THE TRANSMISSION MECHANIC.    PROBLEM 2:  THIS PROBLEM WAS NOTICED ON 03-28-08.  VEHICLE WAS ALSO PURCHASED WITH DEFECTIVE HORN.  TWO + WEEKS AFTER THE CAR WAS PURCHASED I WAS HIT IN THE REAR QUARTER PANEL BY A CARELESS TEENAGER THAT DID NOT LOOK BEFORE HE BACKED OUT OF HIS PARKING SPACE.  I REALIZED SHORTLY AFTER THAT MY HORN WAS NOT PROPERLY WORKING.  THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE SOUNDED THE HORN TO ALERT HIM THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BACK INTO ME IF HAD WANTED TO.  HAD IT REPAIRED RECENTLY IN WHICH THE HORN WAS FOUND TO BE COMPLETELY NON-OPERATIONAL.  ONCE REPAIRED, IT WAS APPARENT THAT ALL WAS WORKING WELL WITH THE HORN AS IT HONKS WHEN THE DOORS ARE LOCKED.  WE DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE CAR WOULD DO THAT AT THE TIME THAT WE PURCHASED IT.  THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG CLUE TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SELLING A CAR WITHOUT A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING HORN IS A SAFETY VIOLATION.  I'M APPALLED THAT THIS WAS NOT CAUGHT BY THE DEALERSHIP!  MORE OVER, THEY STUCK ME WITH AN EXPENSIVE BILL TO REPLACE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPERATIONAL AT THE TIME OF SALE!    PROBLEM 3:  REPAIRED ON 05-22-08.  ALSO, BOTH LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED AS THEY WERE FOUND TO HAVE SEPARATED. MAJOR FRONT END NOISES HEARD PRIOR TO THIS GETTING FIXED AND SLOP IN THE FRONT END WHEN DRIVING.

THE OTHER WAS THE RECALL OF THE REAR DRIVE MODULE (RDM), WHICH WAS CAUSING A MOANING NOISE IN ALL AWD VERSIONS OF THIS VEHICLE.  AFTER THE RDM WAS CHANGED I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE VEHICLES AWD FUNCTION CHARACTERISTICS. WHEN ON A SLIGHT INCLINE IN WET CONDITIONS A FULL THROTTLE ACCELERATION FROM A STOP RESULTED IN SEVERE FRONT WHEEL SPIN WITHOUT ENGAGEMENT OF THE AWD SYSTEM. IN FACT I COULD HEAR A DISCERNABLE CLICKING NOISE EMMINATING FROM THE RDM WHICH SOUNDED AS THOUGH THE AWD FAUNCTIONALITY WAS IN EFFECT BEING NEUTRALIZED.  I HAVE PERFORMED THIS MANEUVER SEVERAL TIMES WITH MY VEHICLE IN THE PAST YEAR (WITH THE ORIGINAL RDM), AND THE AWD SYSTEM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ELIMINATING FRONT WHEEL SPIN AND PROVIDING AMPLE TRACTION GOING UP THE INCLINE.  I BELIEVE THE NEW VERSION OF THE RDM BEING ROLLED OUT TO THE MASSES HAS ONLY SERVED TO CONVERT ALL THE AWD VERSIONS OF THIS VEHICLE TO FWD, AND I BELIEVE SATURN MUST BE PERSUADED TO RE-ENGINEER THEIR RDM TO RESTORE THE AWD FUNCTIONALITY.*AK",

THE CAR HAD 2,000 MILES ON IT. THE MECHANIC WHO WAS SENT BY SATURN'S 800 ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE NUMBER LOOKED AT THE CAR AND SAID I PROBABLY BURNED OUT THE ALTERNATOR BECAUSE IT'S ON THE BOTTOM.

HE ALSO SAID IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT (ALTHOUGH I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER SINCE WHAT MANUFACTURER PUTS AN AIR INTAKE WHERE ROAD WATER CAN BE SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE) AND HE ALSO SAID THE L300 MODEL ALSO HAVE THEIR AIR INTAKE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE.
