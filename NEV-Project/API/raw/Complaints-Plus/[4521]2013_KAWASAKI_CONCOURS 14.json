PER THIS BIKES SPECIFIC FORUMS, NEWER KAWASAKI CONCOURS 14S HAVE THIS ISSUE.THERE ARE MANY \"THREADS/POSTS\" OF THIS ISSUE.    I BELIEVE THAT ITS VERY DANGEROUS. AND ALTHOUGH MY BIKES BRAKES WARPAGE IS LIGHT NOW - IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE, AND AT THIS TIME THE DEALER DOESN'T THINK ITS AN ISSUE EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD FEEL IT WHEN THEY TEST DROVE IT.     I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE BIKE AND THE QUALITY OF THE OEM BRAKE PADS/ROTORS (BRAKE SYSTEM).  *TR",
