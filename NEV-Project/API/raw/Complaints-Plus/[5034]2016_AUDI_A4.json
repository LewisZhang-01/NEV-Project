I came to you with a down payment in hand, stating that I needed a car that drove without issues. I can afford minor repairs, but I wanted something with a clean HISTORY and service RECORD. Zachary Laney, the salesman, claimed that there was nothing wrong with this car. I asked about the headlight and was told, \"Oh no, it's just a bulb! I will buy it so you can replace it.\" Asked about any issues and was told the car was absolutely clean. Sure enough, less than a week after I bought it, it started acting up. I took it to the mechanic to remedy the issue, paid out of pocket even though I was sold a warranty (mistake number two on your part) that I was told would cover most issues. My mechanic is experienced and has taken care of many cars, and sure enough, the issue was not fixed. It was only covered up with makeup per say. I gave it another chance and the vehicle broke down again. This vehicle, which mind you, I put a 4000 dollar down payment on, pay a 17!!!! percent interest rate even though I was told 7 and lied to on paper, is costing me over 470 a month for just the payment. Let alone the repairs. I haven't driven the car a month. Literally. I've paid on it for four months, and it's been in the shop. I let you guys know this and was ignored constantly. I was told that the check engine codes were cleared at one point which means that you KNEW this vehicle was bad. ONTOP of it all, this car was STOLEN and had title ISSUES.
