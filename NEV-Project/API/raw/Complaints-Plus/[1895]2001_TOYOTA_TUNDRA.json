THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT TOYOTA WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT HER PROBLEM SINCE THE PROGRAM HAD EXPIRED. I RECEIVED THIS SAME INFORMATION FROM THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM AND TOYOTA CORPORATE. IN ADDITION TO THE HOLE IN THE FRAME BOTH POWER STEERING LINES RUSTED THROUGH AND SO DID THE POWER STEERING RACK.  TOYOTA'S ATTEMPT AT FIXING THE PROBLEM FAILED AND NOW I'M STUCK WITH A TRUCK THAT HAS A COMPROMISED FRAME. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE PUTTING MYSELF OR MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE AS IT WON'T BE AS STRONG IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH AND KEEPING THE VEHICLE WILL ONLY RESULT IN FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE FRAME. TOYOTA NEEDS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT AND EITHER BUY THE TRUCK BACK OR FIX THE FRAME AND THEY NEED TO DO THIS FOR AL AFFECTED VEHICLES.",

AS TIME WENT ON I BEGAN NOTICING THE RUST UNDER THE CHASSIS AND THEN I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR THE SPARE TIRE BRACKET. I FOUND OUT LATER THAT TOYOTA USED THE SPARE TIRE RECALL TO UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHASSIS RUST PROBLEM. A SHORT TIME LATER I RECEIVED THE RECALL FOR THE CHASSIS EXCHANGE. WHEN I PICKED UP THE TRUCK THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE STEERING, THE WHEEL DID NOT RETURN TO STRAIGHT AFTER A TURN. I COMPLAINED THAT NIGHT AND WAS TOLD IT WAS NORMAL. AFTER A FEW HINDERED MILES THE LINKAGE WAS WORN AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THE CAB WAS NOT ALIGNED TO THE RACK WHEN THEY CHANGED THE CHASSIS.   MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE ROT ISSUE. THE REAR AXLE IS NOW ROTTED TO A POINT WHERE IT IS LEAKING THOUGH THE CASING, NOT THROUGH A SEAL OR FITTING BUT THROUGH THE ROTTED METAL. I DO NOT VIEW A REAR AXLE AS A WEAR/REPLACEMENT PART UNLESS IT IS ABUSED THROUGH THE WORKING OF THE TRUCK. I AM 62 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINE 16 AND HAVE NEVER EVER HAD TO REPLACE A REAR AXLE FOR ROT. THE FACT THAT TOYOTA ACKNOWLEDGED OWNERSHIP FOR THE CHASSIS RUST TELLS ME THAT THEY SHOULD OWN THE AXLE ROT AS WELL. I HAVE CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE WITH NO SUCCESS AND AM LOOKING FOR SOME RELIEF ON THIS REPAIR. TOYOTA QUOTED ME APPROXIMATELY $5000 FOR A NEW AXLE (PARTS AND LABOR). LAST MONTH I SENT $1500 AT THE DEALERSHIP TO REBUILD MY EMERGENCY BRAKES IN ORDER TO PASS OUR STATE SAFETY INSPECTION. EMERGENCY BRAKE LINKAGE IS NOT A WEAR/REPLACEMENT PART.  YOUR THOUGHTS?

I EXPLAINED THAT I AM CONCERNED THAT 1) THE CRC INTERVENTION [PROPOSED BY TOYOTA] DID NOT REMEDY A PROBLEM [THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED BY TOYOTA], 2) THUS THE PROBLEM REMAINS UNRESOLVED, AND 3) SAFETY ISSUES CONTINUE TO EXIST AND THAT THE FRAME IS ACTUALLY WORSE THAN IT HAD BEEN WHEN INSPECTED IN 2012.  CHRIS STATED, 'THE CRC WAS NOT MEANT TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, IT WAS MEANT TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM.' HE EXPLAINED THAT, WHEN THE 2012 RECALL INSPECTIONS OCCURRED, 'IF A FRAME WAS PERFORATED, IT WAS REPLACED.  IF THERE WAS NO PERFORATION, THE CRC WOULD BE APPLIED AND THAT MAY HELP FOR 6 MONTHS, A YEAR, OR 3 YEARS IN YOUR CASE, BUT IT WAS APPLIED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD EVENTUALLY FAIL.'      I EXPLAINED THAT WAS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CRC'S ROLE WHEN THE DEALER DISCUSSED THE PLAN IN 2012.  I HAD BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CRC WAS TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER CORROSION WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE THE FRAME'S INTEGRITY.  I EXPLAINED THAT HAD I KNOWN THE CRC WAS ONLY 'BAND-AIDING' THE PROBLEM, I WOULD HAVE SOLD THE TRUCK IN 2012.  NOW, THE VEHICLE CANNOT PASS AN INSPECTION WHICH IS NEEDED TO BE SOLD, NOR WOULD I WANT TO SELL THE VEHICLE TO OTHERS BECAUSE IT IS UNSAFE. CHRIS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OWNERS WHO RECEIVED FRAME REPLACEMENTS HAD THE PROBLEM RESOLVED.  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED TOYOTA WAS AWARE THAT THE CRC INTERVENTION WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE FOR THE FRAMES THAT PASSED THE INITIAL 2012 INSPECTION.  THEY KNEW THOSE FRAMES WOULD FAIL, THUS THOSE OWNERS SAFETY ISSUES WERE NOT RESOLVED, BUT SIMPLY POSTPONED UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN EXPIRED, LEAVING THESE CUSTOMERS WITH NO ALTERNATIVES.",

MONTHS LATER WHILE CHECKING THE TIRE PRESSURES AT A GAS STATION, I WAS SHOCKED TO NOTICE THAT THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE FRAME ABOUT TWO INCHES ACROSS. I CALLED MY NEAREST TOYOTA DEALER, WOBURN FOREIGN MOTORS, AND SPOKE WITH NICOLE WHO RAN THE VIN NUMBER AND TOLD ME THAT JAFFARIAN TOYOTA IN HAVERHILL HAD INSPECTED THE TRUCK ON 20 APRIL 2012. THEREFORE, THEY WOULD NOT LOOK AT MY TRUCK. NEXT, I CALLED JAFFARIAN AND EXPLAINED THAT THE FRAME LOOKED TO ME AS IF IT COULD SNAP IN HALF, AND THAT I COULD NOT SEE HOW THAT MUCH RUST COULD OCCUR FROM WHEN THEY INSPECTED IT. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN THEN SAID THAT IF THEY HAD INSPECTED AND PASSED THE TRUCK THEN THEY WOULD HAVE APPLIED A PRESERVATIVE UNDERCOATING TO THE FRAME. I POINTED OUT THERE WAS NO SUCH PAINT OR UNDERCOATING ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN ON THE FRAME. HE TRIED TO GET ME BACK ON THE RECALL LIST, BUT FOUND OUT THAT HE COULD NOT. BEING MY ONLY VEHICLE FOR USE TO MAKE A LIVING, I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK UNTIL 11 APRIL 2015, WHEN THE FRAME SNAPPED IN HALF AS I WAS ENTERING MY DRIVEWAY.  I HAD BEEN ON INTERSTATE 95 AT 65 MPH ONLY MINUTES EARLIER, WHEN I EXPECT THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE LOST CONTROL AND PROBABLY ROLLED OVER HAD THE FRAME SNAPPED THEN. IF THE VEHICLE WAS INDEED INSPECTED, THEN IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THE INSPECTOR WAS NEGLIGENT IN HIS DUTIES AND PASSED THE VEHICLE KNOWING THAT IT HAD SEVERE AND DANGEROUS CORROSION TO ITS CHASSIS. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION AND HAVE ASKED THEM TO COVER THE COST OF TOWING MY TRUCK TO A DEALER, AND REPAIRING IT TO A SAFE, ROADWORTHY CONDITION UNDER THE TERMS OF THEIR ORIGINAL RECALL AND THEY HAVE REFUSED.

I TOOK THEIR WORD THAT THE COMPOUND WOULD PREVENT/RESIST AGAINST FURTHER CORROSION AND THAT THE TRUCK WAS SAFE.    A LITTLE OVER A YEAR (AND LESS THAN 3000 MILES) LATER I COULD SEE THE FRAME HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE AND THAT THE SPARE TIRE WAS BEGINNING TO GET LOOSE ON THE CROSS MEMBER.

THE FOLLOWING WEEK, WE GOT A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP, TELLING US THAT TOYOTA HAD DENIED THE DEALERSHIP'S CLAIM TO PROVIDE US A NEW FRAME, BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE TRUCK HAD ALREADY COME IN TO BE INSPECTED THE FIRST TIME, WHEN THEY SPRAYED THE COMPOUND.    THIS LEADS ME TO ONE OF TWO CONCLUSIONS:  EITHER A)  THE SPRAY-ON COMPOUND IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AND DID NOTHING TO PROTECT MY TRUCK'S DEFECTIVE FRAME AGAINST CORROSION,  OR B) THE INITIAL INSPECTION ON MY TRUCK WHICH FOUND IT TO BE ACCEPTABLE WAS IN ERROR, MISSING THE PERFORATION SPOTS THAT WERE CAUGHT THE SECOND TIME AROUND.

FROM WHAT THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS TELL ME THESE TRUCKS CAME WITH FRONT CALIPERS THAT ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE VEHICLE AND THEY GET TOO HOT AND AS A RESULT  THEY WARP THE DISCS AND THIS CREATES A MODERATE TO VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE EVERY TIME THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED . TOYOTA MOTORS REPAIRED THE ISSUE, BY INSTALLING BIGGER CALIPERS WITH MORE SURFACE AREA, AS LONG AS THE CAR WAS WITHIN THE WARRANTY 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES . IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND BE CONSIDERED A GOVERNMENT  RECALL BECAUSE IT IS NOT THAT A PART BROKE OR GOT WORN OUT BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED . IT IS MORE THAT THE CAR CAME WITH BRAKES NOT CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE FRICTION B/W THE PADS AND THE DISC DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE CALIPER AND AS A RESULT IT WARPS THE DISCS CAUSING OWNERS TO RESURFACE OR REPLACE DISCS FREQUENTLY WITHOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM OR SOLVING IT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS ,TO ME, IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE BRAKES DO NOT WORK PROPERLY BUT ALSO BECAUSE ALL THAT SHAKING AND VIBRATION CAN LOOSEN UP OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE SUSPENSION OR BRAKING SYSTEM COMPROMISING THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE AND AS A RESULT THIS MAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT . MANY DISAPPOINTED TUNDRA OWNERS EXPRESS THEIR FRUSTRATION ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON DIFFERENT FORUMS ONE OF THEM IS TOYOTA TUNDRA FORUMS AND ANOTHER IS TUNDRA SOLUTIONS FORUM. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST REVISION OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE A LOT OF US CAN'T AFFORD OR THINK THAT IT IS NOT FAIR TO PAY B/W $2,200- $3,200 THAT THE DEALERSHIPS AND BRAKE SHOPS CHARGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

MY TUNDRA HAS BEEN SO INSPECTED BY A DEALER, PASSED THEIR TEST, AND FOUND TO BE \"SAFE.\".  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE VEHICLE'S UNDERCARRIAGE SHOWS EXTENSIVE CORROSION OF  FRAME, STEERING, AND SUSPENSION COMPONENTS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF TOYOTA'S RECALL.  THE EXTENT OF THE CORROSION IS SO GREAT THAT IT CALLS INTO QUESTION THE POTENTIAL FOR A SUSPENSION OR STEERING COMPONENT TO FAIL DURING OPERATION, LEADING TO A LOSS OF CONTROL AND INJURY TO PASSENGERS AND OTHERS ON THE HIGHWAY.  I HAVE DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF SEVERAL CORROSION SITES ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF MY TRUCK THAT ILLUSTRATE MY CONCERN.  I HAVE TAKEN MY TRUCK TO A BODY SHOP FOR EVALUATION AND WAS TOLD IT IS NOT SAFE.  TOYOTA'S RECALL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE FULL RANGE OF SAFETY ISSUES BROUGHT ON BY THEIR CORROSION PROBLEM.   TOYOTA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO INSPECT ALL OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS SUBJECT TO THE EXCESSIVE CORROSION AND EITHER DETERMINE THEY ARE SAFE OR REPAIR THEM.  IF MY DIGITAL PHOTOS WOULD ASSIST YOU IN UNDERSTANDING MY CONCERN, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FORWARD THEM TO YOU.    THANK YOU!  *TR",

ITS JUST NOW AFTER THE TOYOTA GAS PEDDLE ISSUE CAME TO LIGHT THAT I STARTED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR OVER 8 YEARS WITH THE TOYOTA TUNDRAS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

I LIVE IN MARYLAND AND CURRENTLY OWN A 2001 TOYOTA TUNDRA SR5 4WD.   MY VEHICLE HAS 36,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGE KEPT.

I OWN A 1987 BUICK WITH 117,000 MILES ON IT THAT DOES LOOK NO WHERE NEAR THIS BAD. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS COULD AT SOME POINT POSE A SAFETY RISK.

TOYOTA HAS RECENTLY BEEN GRIEVOUSLY IRRESPONSIBLE ABOUT ISSUING WARNINGS AND RECALL NOTICES ON ITS TOYOTA TUNDRA TRUCKS. THERE IS LITTLE QUESTION THAT A DESIGN FLAW IN THE TUNDRA CAUSES FRONT ROTORS TO WARP VERY QUICKLY, CAUSING THE TRUCK TO SHUDDER DURING BRAKING. TOYOTA EVEN ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN, BUT TOYOTA DEALERS HAVE NOT ALERTED CONSUMERS TO THE PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM OR BLAMED FOR BRAKING TOO HARD, THAT IS, UNTIL THEIR 36,000 MILE WARRANTY EXPIRED. AT THIS POINT THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED THE BRAKE PROBLEM AND OFFERED ASSISTANCE AT FULL PRICE....ABOUT $2000.    THE TOYOTA TUNDRAS ARE BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE THE REAR BRAKES DO NOT SELF-ADJUST PROPERLY. THIS TRANSFERS THE ENTIRE BRAKING LOAD TO THE FRONT WHEELS. THE FRONT ROTORS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE AND HEAT, AND SO THEY END UP WARPING. THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THE SEVERE SHIMMY AND VIBRATION AT ALL SPEEDS, BUT ESPECIALLY BETWEEN 40-50 MPH.    BECAUSE THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THE REAR BRAKES, ROTORS THAT ARE REPAIRED ARE COMPLETELY WARPED AGAIN WITHIN 5,000 MILES. TOYOTA HAS HAD DOZENS OF OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE TUNDRA MODEL, BUT THEY ONLY ISSUE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ONLINE AND MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO INFORM CUSTOMERS. EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM, BUT SINCE MY TRUCK HAS OVER 36,000 MILES WE HAVE TO BASICALLY PAY FOR A MANUFACTURE DEFECT.  THIS PROBLEM IS NOT DUE TO NORMAL USE AND WEAR, IT IA A DESIGN PROBLEM, AND ONE THAT TOYOTA NEEDS TO FIX.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  *NM",
