THEY STATED THAT THE ROLLOVER SENSOR HAD INDICATED DEPLOYMENT. THE VEHICLE DID NOT ROLL, NOR DID THE SRS SYSTEM DEPLOY. THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT OF THE ROLLOVER SENSOR. I HAD THEM FULLY TEST THE SYSTEM TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE $500.00 PART WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I HAD THEM REPLACE THE SENSOR WITH GM APPROVED PARTS BOUGHT FROM THE DEALERSHIP.  AFTER THE REPAIR, THE MECHANIC STATED THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL FAULT WITH THE SENSOR - BUT HAD NO WAY OF TESTING THE CIRCUITS; NOR THE WILLINGNESS TO TRY A PART HE FIXED BECAUSE IT COULD DEPLOY THE SYSTEM. THE LIGHT IS ON AGAIN (THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED JUNE 11, 2013). I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY PULLED THE ENTIRE DASH APART AND TESTED ALL THE CIRCUITS.
