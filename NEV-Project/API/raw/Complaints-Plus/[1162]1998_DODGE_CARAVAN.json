I FIRST TOLD THE BULLETIN DIDN'T EXIST, THEN WHEN I DEMANDED SHE SEARCH UNDER THE BULLETIN NUMBER SHE TOLD ME IT DIDN'T APPLY TO MY VEHICLE.  THE BULLETINS CLEARLY STATES 1996-2000 NS  TOWN&COUNTRY/VOYGER/CARAVAN.  HM494 THEN STATED THAT SERVICE BULLETINS WERE ONLY FOR TECHNICIANS AND MECHANICS.  I EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS THE PROBLEM.  THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION DIRECTLY RELATED TO DRIVER & PASSENGER SAFETY THAT WAS ISSUED IN 2002 APPARENTLY WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER.    PERSONALLY I DO NOT THINK HM494 WAS QUALIFIED TO MAKE THE STATEMENTS THAT REPRESENT CHRYSLERS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BECAUSE MY CARAVAN HAS 126,000 MILES I SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANYTHING FROM CHRYSLER.  MY CARAVAN WOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN 4YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE SERVICE BULLETIN.  *TR",

THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT ON DAMP PAYMENT (NO STANDING WATER) WHILE AT A REST STOP MANY MILES FROM HOME.  BOTH INCIDENTS OCCURRED ON NORMAL PAVEMENT AND DRIVING DURING RAINY DAYS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING.     THE VAN HAS THE STANDARD 3.0 LITER V6 ENGINE WITH 88K MILES, BUT THE SERPENTINE BELT INSTALLED WAS LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD.  TWO SETS OF PROFESSIONAL MECHANICS FOUND THE BELT, THE BELT TENSIONER, AND ALL RELATED PARTS OF THE SYSTEM IN GOOD WORKING ORDER (INCLUDING THE ENGINE MOUNTS).  IN SUMMARY, THE SYSTEM WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND WORKING AS DESIGNED.  THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS THE DESIGN OF THIS SYSTEM.   THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN VERY RELIABLE DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. BUT THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS GREATLY DISTRESSING.  NOT ONLY IS THE RANGE OF THE VEHICLE LIMITED TO A COUPLE OF MILES WITH A STRONG BATTERY, THE LOSS OF POWER ASSISTED STEERING MAKES THIS BOTH A SAFETY AND RELIABILITY ISSUE.  *NM",

THE REPAIR WAS EXHORBITANT INITIALLY.  AFTER DISCUSSION A SERVICE BULLETIN 23-044-02 WAS PRODUCED THAT INDICATED THERE WAS A DEFECT FOR ALL DODGE CARAVAN'S MODEL YEARS 1996-200.  MY VEHICLE IS A 1998 DODGE CARAVAN.  THE SERVICE BULLETIN INDICATED A REPAIR KIT AND I WAS GIVEN A MORE REASONABLE ESTIMATE BY THE ROUEN BODY SHOP.

I BLAME THIS DEALERSHIP ENTIRELY FOR THIS NEGLIGENCE AND DOUBT IF I WILL EVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT AND CERTAINLY NOT AT THIS DEALERSHIP.

MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE WAS AROUND 60,000 AT THIS POINT. I SPOKE WITH AN EMPLOYEE OF THE THEN DAIMLER CHRYSLER (I BELIEVE THAT UNIT HAS BEEN SOLD TO BEHR CORPORATION) HVAC UNIT IN DAYTON, OH. HE ASKED ME TO HAVE THE EVAPORATOR UNIT CHECKED. A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE IS A MECHANIC; I HAD HIM DO THE WORK. HE PLACED DYE IN THE SYSTEM TO CHECK FOR LEAKS AND DYE WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING FROM THE AC DRAIN, POINTING TO THE IMPENDING FAILURE OF THE EVAPORATOR. I RELAYED THIS INFORMATION TO THE CHRYSLER EMPLOYEE AND HE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS INDEED THE EVAPORATOR THAT WAS CAUSING A COOLANT LEAK. AT THAT TIME HE ASKED ME TO CONTACT MY DEALER TO SEE IF ANY SERVICE BULLETINS OR RECALL NOTICES HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM. I ALSO CALLED TO VERIFY MY WARRANTY, ETC., TO COVER MY BASES. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS AND THAT I WAS INDEED OUT OF WARRANTY. I ALSO ASKED FOR AN APPROXIMATE PRICE TO REPLACE AN EVAPORATOR AND WAS QUOTED A PRICE THAT WAS APPROACHING $1000.00  I DID NOT REALLY GET AGITATED OVER THIS UNTIL THIS PAST JULY. FIGURING THAT THE ROUTINE OF RECHARGING THE UNIT FOR THE WARM MONTHS WAS A PRUDENT WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM, I WAS PREPARED TO SPEND ABOUT $25.00 FOR COOLANT AND GO ON MY MERRY WAY FOR THIS SUMMER. ONE SLIGHT PROBLEM. THE COMPRESSOR FAILED AT 66,000 MILES.  AS I STATED BEFORE, I UNDERSTAND WARRANTIES AND I GET THE PROCESS.

ON FEB 21ST, 2003 WHILE WE WERE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, THE TRANSMISSION GAVE UP AND BROKE. THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS STRANDED, AS THE VEHICLE WOULDN''T MOVE AT ALL.  THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY 42,000 MILES ON IT AND ONLY 6000 MILES AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED.        I THEREFORE CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER SUPPORT. THEY REPLIED PLAINLY THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE IT HAS PASSED THE WARRANTY.  I THEN  PURCHASED A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION FROM PHOENIX REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION IN ARIZONA AND HAD KUAN''S AUTO REPAIR, AN ASE CERTIFIED REPAIR SHOP IN ST. PAUL, FIX IT.     I WENT ON AND CONDUCT AN EXTENDED RESEARCH ON CHRYSLER''S TRANSMISSION. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG IF A BRAND NEW TRANSMISSION WOULD BROKE IN 42000 MILES.  THE RESULT OF THE RESEARCH IS ASTOUNDING:  CHRYSLER HAD THIS TYPE OF THE TRANSMISSION SINCE 1988 AND IT IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE TRANSMISSION. THE WORST PART IS, CHRYSLER KNEW ABOUT IT SINCE BEGINNING AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION (A604 41TE) ON DODGE, PLYMOUTH, CHRYSLER BRANDS OF MINI VANS.   CHRYSLER''S IGNORANCE TO THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WITH THIS DEFECTED TRANSMISSION ON THEIR MINI VANS.       A MINI VAN IS A FAMILY CAR AND THOUSANDS OF MOTHERS AND CHILDREN DEPEND ON IT.

WHEN I TRIED TO PUT MY CAR BACK IN GEER I HEARD THE SAME NOISE AND MY VEHICLES WHEELS LOCKED UP AND  WOULD NOT MOVE  FORWARD OR BACKWARD.I HAD IT TOWED AND THE TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST INSPECTED IT AND SHOWED ME THAT THE PLANITARY EXPLODED INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION HE SAID THIS IS A MANUFACTURES DEFECT AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. HE GAVE ME THE PARTS THAT WERE SHATTERED AND CRACKED MANY IN SUCH LITTLE PIECES YOU CANT FIND THAT GOT MIXED IN WITH THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. HE ALSO TOLD ME I'M LUCKY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN WHEN I WAS DRIVING IT WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE VAN.  I IMAGINE WE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW. THIS REPAIR COST ME $1600.00 DOLLARS I CALLED CRYSLER AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE AND COULDN'T HELP WITH THIS. IF IT'S A DEFECTIVE PART THAN AREN'T THEY RESPONSIBLE? PLEASE HELP.  THANK YOU ,JULIE ANN HIT. *AK",

DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION OF OUR PROBLEMS THEY ALSO FOUND AN OIL LEAK.  MY HUSBAND IS VERY GOOD WITH CARS AND HAS MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, TO NO AVAIL.  ON 3-9-2001 I HAD THE CAR OIL LEAK DIAGNOSED BY AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE.  THEY SAID THE HEAD GASKET WAS LEAKING OIL AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $600.00 AND DOWN TIME OF THE VEHICLE BEING 2-3 DAYS.  AS THIS IS OUR MAIN VEHICLE THIS PRESENTS A PROBLEM.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MANY PEOPLE AND GARAGES THAT THESE 4 CYLINDER ENGINES ARE WIDELY KNOWN TO HAVE TRANSMISSION AND HEAD GASKET PROBLEMS.  ONE GARAGE WENT SO FAR AS TO TELL US THAT CHRYSLER KNEW THEY HAD THESE PROBLEMS BUT JUST WOULD NOT PUT OUT A RECALL.  WE HAVE HAD THE VAN FOR 23 MONTHS.  NOTHING WENT WRONG DURING THE VALID WARRANTY TIME.  WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY OVER WARRANTY BY APPROXIMATELY 5000 MILES.  OUR DEALER WAS NOT WILLING TO WORK WITH US WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THEY HAD ORIGINALLY GIVEN US, SO WE WERE FORCED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PAY OUT OF OUR POCKET FOR THE REPAIRS, AS WE COULD NOT AFFORD A RENTAL CAR FOR THE 3-5 WEEKS THE DEALER WAS GOING TO TAKE TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR THE PROBLEM.

FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE DOOR WILL REMAIN LOCKED AND WILL NOT OPEN WITH A REMOTE ENTRY SYSTEM , WITH A KEY OR MANUALLY FROM INSIDE THE CAR.  THE MANUAL LOCKING MECHANISM ON THE INSIDE IS PHYSICALLY JAMMED AND WILL NOT RESPOND TO AN UNLOCKING ACTION OF ANY FORCE.  IT OCCURED TO THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR FIRST AROUND JUNE '99,  THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT DOOR AROUND AUGUST '99 AND TODAY THE PASSENGERS SIDE CARGO DOOR.  WHEN IT HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME IN JUNE I WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME (WAS TOLD THEY NO LONGER TAKE APPTS. AND IT'S FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE, MAY TAKE ONE TO THREE DAYS).  FOR THAT REASON I TOOK A CRACK AT IT MYSELF BY REMOVING THE PART OF THE INNER DOOR PANEL THAT WAS ACCESIBLE AND AWKWARDLY INSPECTED THE MECHANISM WITH A FLASHLIGHT AND DENTAL MIRROR.  IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THERE ARE 2 SOLENOIDS AND I COULD FEEL BOTH OF THEM ENERGIZE WHEN I OPERATED THE DOOR MOUNTED LOCK/UNLOCK SWITCH ALTHOUGH NEITHER ONE CREATED ANY KIND OF LINKAGE MOVEMENT.  AFTER MASSAGING THE LINKAGES AND LEVERS BLINDLY FOR APPROX. 2 HRS. THE DOOR FINALLY UNLOCKED (REASON UNKNOWN).  WHEN THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR PRESENTED THE SAME SYMPTOMS (NOTICED BY PRIMARY DRIVER (\"THE WIFE\") ), IT RESOLVED ITSELF BY THE END OF THE DAY AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS AROUND TOWN AND B4 I COULD CHECK IT OUT. FINALLY, THIS MORNING THE PASS. SIDE CARGO DOOR DECIDED IT WAS IT'S TURN AND CURRENTLY REMAINS IN THIS STATE.  I CALLED THE DEALER TONIGHT AND THEY SAID THEY COULD LOOK AT IT IN THE MORNING SO I BEGRUDGINGLY WILL NOT TOUCH IT.  THIS IRKS ME FOR 2 REASONS, ONE IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE UNOBSTRUCTED INSPECTION BECAUSE OF THE LARGE OPEN AREA AROUND THE DOOR AND SECONDLY, I KNOW I COULD PROBABLY FIGURE THIS OUT IN LESS TIME WITH A MORE CONCRETE ANSWER THAN I SUSPECT I'LL BE GIVEN.
