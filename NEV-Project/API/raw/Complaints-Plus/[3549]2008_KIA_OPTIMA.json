THIS IS A FIRST FOR OUR CAR AND THIS INCIDENT WE HAD WITH OUR CAR IS THE SAME DESCRIPTION AS THE RECALL. WE FEEL THAT KIA SHOULD COVER THIS COST DUE TO IT BEING A MANUFACTUER ERROR.

I AM BRINGING THIS MATTER TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE DANGER THIS REPRESENTS TO DRIVERS OF KIA VEHICLES THAT HAVE ELECTRIC ADJUSTABLE SEATS. MY WIFE AND I WERE VERY FORTUNATE WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC FATALITY DUE TO THIS.    RECENTLY, WHILE TRAVELING, THE DRIVER'S SEAT RETRACTED TO ITS FULL-UPRIGHT, FULL-FORWARD POSITION. IN THIS POSITION, THE HEADREST FORCED MY WIFE'S HEAD DOWN INTO THE STEERING WHEEL AND UP AGAINST IT. SHE WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR SAFELY. THE ONLY WAY TO DRIVE THE CAR WAS TO REMOVE THE HEADREST, WHICH ALLOWED ENOUGH ROOM BETWEEN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE BODY TO STEER THE CAR.  I CONTACTED CASEY KIA WHILE STOPPED TO ASK WHAT COULD BE DONE TO RELEASE THE SEAT. I WAS TOLD TO REMOVE THE SEAT'S FUSE FROM THE INSIDE CABIN FUSE PANEL, WHICH SHOULD DISENGAGE IT; THIS DID NOT WORK, AND WE WERE FORCED TO DRIVE THREE HOURS TO THE NEAREST REPAIR SHOP. THERE IS NO MANUAL OVERRIDE MECHANISM IN THE 2008 KIA OPTIMA EX TO UNLOCK A SEAT WHEN THE ELECTRIC SEAT ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM FAILS.    THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THE DRIVER-SIDE SEAT. THE FIRST DRIVER'S SEAT WAS REPLACED BECAUSE OF A FAULTY SEAT-HEATER WHILE UNDER THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY. THE REPLACEMENT SEAT WHEN INSTALLED IN THE CAR BECAUSE THE ADJUSTMENT KNOB WAS LOOSE AND NEVER SECURE.    THREE ISSUES ARE PARAMOUNT, THE SAFETY FOR KIA DRIVERS, THE FACT THERE IS NO MANUAL OVERRIDE FOR ELECTRIC SEATS, AND NO WARRANTY FOR REPLACEMENT SEATS ON SUCH OCCASIONS, THE FIRST HERE BEING OF MOST IMPORTANCE.  *TR",

MY QUESTION IS: I HAVE A 3 YR OLD GRANDSON, BUT LET'S SUPPOSE HE IS 5 AND HE WANTS TO GO OUT AND PLAY, WHICH HE COULD DO UNSUPERVISED, AND HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO GET IN GRANDMA'S CAR AND PLAY AND ACCIDENTALLY LETS THE EMERGENCY BRAKE OFF.  MY CAR WOULD THEN BEGIN SLIPPING BACKWARD WITH THE CHILD INSIDE.  I CONSIDER THAT TO BE A BIG SAFETY HAZARD.  FURTHER I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT THAT IF YOUR PARKING BRAKE FAILS, THE GEAR BOX WOULD STILL KEEP THE CAR FROM ROLLING BACKWARDS.  2.  MY CAR STALLS FAIRLY FREQUENTLY IN 1ST GEAR, AND VERY FREQUENTLY IN REVERSE, BOTH INCIDENTS OCCUR WHEN THE CAR IS INCHING UP OR OUT OF A PARKING SPACE.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO IT AND WILL LET ME KNOW, BUT AGAIN, IN HEAVY TRAFFIC THIS RUNS THE RISK OF BEING REARENDED.    IF YOU CAN INFORM ME ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT AS THE DEALERSHIP DOESN'T SEEM INCLINED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT EITHER PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT.  IT MAY JUST BE A FUEL TO AIR RATIO MIX GOING INTO THE ENGINE ON THE STALLING, WHICH SHOULD BE SIMPLE ENOUGH TO FIX, BUT SURELY THE COMPRESSION IN THE ENGINE CAN ALSO BE ADJUSTED SO THE CAR WILL NOT SLIP BACKWARD WHEN IN FIRST GEAR.  *TR",
