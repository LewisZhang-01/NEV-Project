WITHIN MINUTES I PULLED OFF ONTO A HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE WHERE I STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH.  OPENING THE HOOD, I BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM(S).  COOL UPPER RADIATOR HOSE.  COOL RADIATOR CAP.  TURNED CAP OFF AND DISCOVERED NO COOLANT IN RADIATOR.  NO APPARENT SOURCE OF LEAKING.  ADDED ICE WATER FROM ICE CHEST TO RADIATOR HOPING TO LOCATE SOURCE OF LEAK.  TURNED ENGINE ON AND LOCATED LEAK BENEATH PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE:  TWO SMALL HOLES IN CORRODED EXPOSED STEEL TUBING ROUTING COOLANT TO REAR HEATER ASSEMBLY IN REAR OF VAN.  THE NEXT DAY DISCOVERED THAT CHRYSLER HAD CHANGED THE PART FROM STEEL TO ALUMINUM IN LATE 2000'S TO HELP PREVENT THE CORROSIVE ACTION OF ROAD SALT IN THE NORTHERN CLIMATES THAT HAD AFFECTED MANY SIMILAR VEHICLES DURING THE MID-2000'S.  HOWEVER, DAIMLER CHRYSLER CHOSE NOT TO INSTITUTE A RECALL OF THE FAULTY DESIGNED PART FULLY EXPOSED BENEATH THE VEHICLE.  THE COST OF REPLACING THE PART AT THE DEALERSHIP IN STONE MOUNTAIN, GA, WAS AROUND $650.00 USD, NOT A HUGE SUM, BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT COST-EFFICIENT FOR THE AUTOMAKER AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS.      THIS PROBLEM COULD BE LIFE-THREATENING IF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS WERE STRANDED DURING THE WINTER MONTHS IN NORTHERN U.S. OR CANADA, WHEN LOSS OF ALL COOLANT OCCURRED.  OPERATING VEHICLE WITH NO COOLANT COULD RESULT IN THE ENGINE SEIZING UP WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, CAUSING INJURY TO DRIVER AND PASSENGERS AND POSSIBLY OTHER MOTORISTS.

THROUGH TRITHE INTERNET, I DISCOVERED THAT THE REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE 20AMP FUSE IN THE IOD SLOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM, BUT ONLY ONE TIME.  I DISCUSSED THIS AT THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SUCH PROBLEM WITH THE 2003 GRAND CARAVAN. I CERTAINLY FIND THAT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. I WILL BE APPROACHING THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN CONCERNING THE DOOR LOCKS VERY SOON. MAYBE THEY WILL RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT CHARGE SINCE IT IS AN INHERENT TROUBLE WITH THEIR AUTOMOBILE. *TR",

I TOOK THE CAR TO THREE DEALERSHIPS TO TRY TO GET SATISFACTION.  TWO OF THOSE HAVE SINCE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.  THE THIRD REFUSES TO HELP IN ANY WAY.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT SOME DEALERSHIP HAS ALREADY CLOSED OUT THE TICKET FOR FIXING THE POWER STEERING RETURN HOSE ON MY 2003 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN.  THE CAR WAS NEVER FIXED:  IT STILL HAS THE FACTORY HOSE.  FINALLY I TOOK THE CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE WHERE A FORMER CHRYSLER TECHNICIAN WORKED WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM..  HE SAID THAT NOT ONLY HAD THE RECALL NEVER BEEN DONE, BUT THE DESIGN WAS FAULTY.  THE POWER STEERING RETURN HOSE IS SO SHORT THAT THE SYNTHETIC ATF THAT IS USED AS POWER STEERING FLUID FOAMS UP CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH BELCHING OUT FLUID, POWER STEERING FAILURE, PUMP FAILURE AND EVENTUALLY RACK AND PINION FAILURE.  I TOLD HIM NOT TO TOUCH THE POWER STEERING BECAUSE THE RECALL WAS NEVER PERFORMED.  HE AGREED THAT THE REPAIR HAD NEVER BEEN DONE AND ESTIMATED THE REPAIR COST AT $800.00 TO PUT A NEW RACK AND PINION AND TO REPAIR THE FAULTY DESIGN PER THE CHRYSLER TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN.  MY PROBLEM NOW IS THE PUMP HAS GONE BAD TOO WHICH WILL ADD ANOTHER $500.00 TO THE PRICE.  MY DODGE GRAND CARAVAN VIN IS [XXX].  CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME?  MY PHONE NUMBER IS [XXX].

THIS TIME I INVESTIGATED THE SYSTEM AND FOUND THAT THE SQUEELER TABS HAD BROKEN OFF FROM OVERHEATING.FURTHER THE LOWERCALIPER BOLTS ON BOTH SIDES SHOWED SIGNS OF HEAT DISCOLORATION.  IN LOOKING FOR THE CAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS CAUSED BY LACK OF AIR FLOW TO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE CALIPER AND BRAKES.  LOOKING AT THE AIR FLOW SYSTEM TO THE BRAKES THE AIR IS TUNNELED VIA CUTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT SKIRT AND TRAVELS BETWEEN THE WHEEL AND THE INNER PLASTIC WHEEL WELL.THERE IS AN ANGLED PROTRUSION IN THE INNER WHEEL WELL THAT DIVERTS THE AIR TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE WHEEL.  IT APPEARS THE THIS PROTRUSION IS TO FAR BACK AND THE AIR IS NOT FLOWING OVER THE BRAKES AND CALIPER.  AS A NOTE THE REAR BRAKES WERE ADJUSTED AND THE SELF ADJUSTERS ARE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.PLESE CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  I HAVE SEARCHED TSB'S,IATN (SPONSORING MENBER),RECALLS AND COMPLAINTS. IN TALKING TO CHRYSLER TECH'S THEY SAID THIS IS COMMON AND THE BRAKES AVERAGE 10 TO 12 THOUSAND MILES.THE PROBLEM  CAN BE DUPLICATED EVEN AFTER NEW BRAKES AND ROTORS INSTALLED AND TRAVELING DOWN AN EXTENDED STEEP ROAD  WITH BRAKING.
