The car was stopped in the middle of two lanes. I was able to get help and push the car back in the business driveway by keeping it in neutral. The car would make repetitive clicking sounds if I left it in park.   I had it towed. Repair shop fixed issue. It was the left front axel shaft that broke. My car has about 130,000 miles on it and is a 2010 Honda Fit. It is available for inspection.  I am so thankful that I wasn't on a high speed road as a car could have collided into me when I was turning left because the axle broke before I could get fully into one lane. If I had been moving at higher speeds, I definitely would have gotten in an accident.   There were no warning indicators before the incident. I regularly serviced the vehicle.",

EACH TIME, WE FOUND THAT THIS CAR WAS NOT LISTED. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR, WE RECEIVED A SAFETY RECALL LETTER FROM HONDA, REGARDING THE FRONT TAKATA AIRBAGS. WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, AND THEY HELD IT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, PLUS THEY PROVIDED US WITH A RENTAL CAR, AS THE VEHICLE WAS \"UNSAFE\" TO DRIVE. WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, I NOTICED ON THE WORK ORDER THAT ONLY THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG WAS REPLACED. (I HAD ASSUMED BOTH FRONT AIRBAGS WOULD BE REPLACED.) WHEN I QUESTIONED THE SERVICE REP, HE SIMPLY SAID THAT THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL.     IN JULY, WE RECEIVED THE 2ND RECALL LETTER FROM HONDA, THIS TIME FOR THE PASSENGER AIR BAG. WHEN I CALLED OUR SERVICE REP, HE INFORMED ME THAT ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED!    I CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE. THEY ALL TOLD ME DIFFERENT THINGS. THE FIRST ONE TOLD ME THAT THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT, DUE TO A \"SENSOR\" IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. WHEN I CHECKED OUT OUR CAR, IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE! THE AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY, EVEN IF THE SEAT IS NOT OCCUPIED! OUR CAR DOES NOT HAVE THIS \"SENSOR\" FEATURE!    AFTER WAITING SEVERAL DAYS FOR THE PROMISED \"RETURN CALL\" FROM CASE MANAGEMENT, I CALLED HONDA AT 888-999-1009. TALKED WITH A REP WHO TOLD ME THAT SHE COULD FIND NO RECORD OF MY EVER HAVING CALLED,OR ANY CASE SET UP AND SENT TO CASE MANAGEMENT!    ALL OF THE PREVIOUS REPS HAD SIMPLY LIED TO ME!    NOW, I AM SIMPLY WAITING FOR A PHONE CALL, WITH A CAR THAT I CANNOT DRIVE. IT IS UNSAFE.    I NEED FOR HONDA TO TALK TO ME, AND MAKE A DECISION. I CAN TAKE THEM TO COURT TO RECOVER THE COST OF A RENTAL CAR , IF NECESSARY.    HONDA CASE NO. 04897936.",

I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR ON THE HIGHWAY AND WAS IN THE LEFT MOST LANE GOING ABOUT 70 MPH. SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY WARNING MY CAR BEGAN TO SWERVE VIOLENTLY TO THE RIGHT INTO THE LANE TO MY RIGHT. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT ONE OF THE TIRES HAD BLOWN OUT, SO I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS AND DID NOT TOUCH THE BRAKES, THINKING JUST THAT I SHOULD TRY TO KEEP THE CAR AWAY FROM OTHER VEHICLES AND AS GENTLY AS I COULD BRING IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AWAY FROM TRAFFIC. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST SWERVE, THE CAR DID NOT REACT IN THE SLIGHTEST TO MY STEERING ATTEMPTS TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT OR AWAY FROM TRAFFIC, AND IT SWERVED LEFT AND RIGHT A COUPLE MORE TIMES BEFORE HITTING THE CONCRETE MEDIAN ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. THE FRONT OF THE CAR CRUNCHED INTO THE MEDIAN, AND THE WHOLE CAR FLIPPED ON ITS PASSENGER SIDE AND SCRAPED AGAINST THE MEDIAN BEFORE FINALLY COMING TO A HALT UPSIDE DOWN. ONCE THE CAR STOPPED I SAW THAT MIRACULOUSLY NOTHING INSIDE OF THE CAR WAS IMPEDING MY EXIT, AND THE GLASS ON BOTH THE WINDOWS HAD COMPLETELY SHATTERED, SO I UNDID MY SEATBELT AND CRAWLED OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW AND IMMEDIATELY STOOD UP. THANKFULLY NO OTHER CARS OR PASSENGERS WERE INVOLVED, 911 WAS CALLED, AND THE POLICEMAN WHO CAME SAID THE INCIDENT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS DUE TO TIRE DAMAGE FROM MY DESCRIPTION BUT THEN EXAMINED THE WHEELS OF THE CAR AND REPORTED THAT HE DIDN?T SEE ANYTHING AWRY WITH THEM, LEAVING THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT A MYSTERY. I HEARD NO SOUNDS PRECEDING THE SWERVING, SMELLED NO STRANGE SMELLS, NOTICED NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THE CAR?S STEERING, AND HAVE HAD NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER OF ANYTHING BEING ?OFF?

WHILE DRIVING ABOUT 5 MPH (I.E., GOING DOWN A SPIRAL RAMP, PARKING MY CAR INSIDE THE GARAGE IN MY HOME AND BEING IN EXTREMELY SLOW STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC) MY RIGHT FOOT IS ON AND OFF THE BRAKE.  I DO NOT USE MY LEFT FOOT AT ALL IN DRIVING. FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR (FROM JULY 2010 TO JUNE 2011) DURING SUCH SITUATIONS THE ENGINE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND THE NEEDLE ON THE RPM DIAL WENT TO 4,000-5,000. I HAD TO STEP HARD WITH MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO KEEP THE CAR FROM LURCHING FORWARD.  THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED ON JUNE 5, 2011 IN THE MIDDLE OF EXTREMELY SLOW STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC. I HAD TO PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE AND QUICKLY SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS TIME MY WIFE WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME AND WITNESSED THIS MOST SCARY AND DANGEROUS INCIDENT.  I EXPLAINED ALL OF THIS TO THE MECHANICS AT MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE ON 6/21/11.  HOWEVER, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO RECREATE A SUDDEN ACCELERATION SITUATION AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR.
