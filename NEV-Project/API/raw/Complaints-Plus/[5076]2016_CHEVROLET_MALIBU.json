Noticed that seat belts had deployed, one of the seat belts was the wrong one for the vehicle as well as an incorrectly installed bolt for the SRS.  Had to replace both seat belts and pretensioners  and airbag control module installed ($2,250).  Then the auto body shop noticed that pigtails were missing and spliced together.  Had this fixed at a dealership for $1,800 along with programming of the airbag control module to the vehicle.  Owner of Car Key Autoplex said that vehicle was repaired 100% when it wasn\u2019t.

The situation was incredibly dangerous as there was snow piled on the shoulder, leaving me with no safe way to quickly get out of the way of fast-moving traffic. Once out of the way and after restarting the car and seeing no warning lamps, messages, or anything indicating there were ongoing issues, I turned my hazards off, my turn signal on and made my way back onto the roadway when there was enough distance between myself and the next oncoming car. Upon re-entering the roadway and reaching 24 mph, the car display the same message and reduced speed to max of 12 mph and I was nearly rear-ended by the driver I entered the roadway in front of (with more than ample time and distance to safely reach the speed limit). After several more attempts, I placed hazards on and continued on side of roadway as far as possible. Drove to an AutoZone where they were able to scan my car and informed me that the code I received (have printed doc of code being thrown with date of incident from AutoZone) was very common in the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu's and he recommended that I see if I can return the car to the dealership (had just purchased less than 60 days prior with 78,000 miles on it).",

It said you may drive the car however speed and acceleration would be reduced. I got off the highway and since I was close to home I drove the car at the reduced speed (as far to the edge of the road as I could get) to my home (2/5/22) I called my dealership to tell them what happened and they told me not to drive it and that if my insurance or roadside assistance would not cover the tow they would come and pick it up for me. My car was towed to my dealership and when I spoke to them and told them what happened, they didn't sound like it was a big deal. I asked if there was a recall on what happened to my car and they said no. They advised they would diagnose it first thing Monday morning (2/7) and would probably repair it the same day. I never received a call back that day and I tried to reach out three times and was not able to speak to anyone about it. In the meantime I had to pay for an Uber to get me to a location to pick up a rental car which I also had to pay for on my own. I feel that this was a very dangerous thing that happened to me while driving my car and just thinking of what could have happened is very upsetting. What happened is a big deal to me. My car is in the shop now and honestly I am upset and I'm not sure if I will feel safe when or if it is repaired. I also am concerned about the cost. On top of what I have already spent, I was advised that I would have to pay for the diagnosis and the repair since my car is out of warranty.

The brakes are very hard and a loud thumping noise was coming from under the hood when you pressed the brakes.  It was very hard to stop the car.  I knew it was the same issue from September 2020.  The vacuum pump was removed and returned to the dealership where the I purchased it from in September 2020 when the original part failed.  The part I returned in June 2021 was still under warranty.  When I returned it and told them it failed the exact same way in 2020, the man in parts said \"They PROBABLY won't warranty the part again since it failed twice. So there's probably something else wrong with your car\"  REALLY!!!  I did notice that the part had been redesigned and the part that breaks off in the engine is no longer there.  This proves Chevrolet knows this is an issue, but refuses to recall these vehicles. Thankfully I was on a country road, not driving fast when it failed this time.  We live at the bottom of 2 hills, so I had to drive partially in the ditch to help the car slow down enough to safely pull into my driveway with no brakes.",

I decided to start the car again to see if it would repeat what happened.  The car started, but no lights came on on the dashboard or radio.  I had to press the start button again before any lights would come on.  But the engine would die about 3 seconds after the lights came on.  The light on the start button was green the entire time until I pressed it a third time. (I have video of this). After this the car wouldn't start at all.  I left the car alone for the evening.  The next morning I attempted to start the car and it wouldn't start at all, it was as if the battery was dead.  I drove my daughter's car to work.  The battery was purchased in early 2019 and was still under warranty, but the dealership wouldn't check the battery back unless it was in the car, which wouldn't start.  I purchased a battery tester and the battery was dead.  I recharged the battery and the car still stumbled to start but would eventually start after several tries.  The car appears to drive ok, but won't start without charging the battery or getting a jump start. And once it starts, it's very hard to get it to start again immediately.  This has been going on for 2 months now.  I haven't been driving the car because I have an hour one way commute to work and can't chance the car giving me any issues.  I periodically jump start the car and drive it for 5-10 miles. Yesterday, I jump started the car and when I killed the engine, the fan didn't go off again.  It took about 6 tries to start the car again, once it started and I killed the engine the fan finally stopped.

I took my car for a diagnostic test and the results were Trouble Codes: P2138, U0401-71 and C0242-00. I have done my research and from what I have found so far, is that several people have made Youtube videos about these codes, complaints and complaints on this website as well, and it has come to my understanding, that if enough people complain that this can be a safety issue, then maybe the \"POWERS THAT BE\", will help with this issue and possibly resolve it. This is and can be dangerous for an individual to drive at the average speed on most U.S. highways, 65, and they decelerate without warning down to 40 mph. I'm not sure why anyone does not se the dangers in this situation, especially with other motorists on the road driving at speeds of up to 70 mph, sometimes 75 mph. If I have vehicles behind me driving 65 or more and my vehicle decides to decelerate because of a sensor failure, the vehicle behind me is not going to know that there is a problem and may not have enough time to react before causing an accident. I am adding my concern not only to many individuals who have reported the same or similar experience , but in hopes that this issue would gain more attention.",

As I exited the highway my brakes was stuck and my brakes wouldn't press. I panicked because I was going at least 60 mph trying to slow down to get on the exit with semi trucks in the front and in the back, because I was a little skilled with cars I down shifted my car and stepped on my emergency brakes and ran the car off the road into the grass. I towed the car to my mechanic in Hiram, GA. (Donnie's Automotive) to have him work on the issue as I wasn't sure what was going on. I got my car back on 3/1/2019. Now the next incident happen on 8/16/21 my engine decreased and my car wouldn't accelerate more than 40 mph. Took it to my mechanic again and it was the throttle sensor. Now the most recent incident happen 6/12/21 where my brakes failed to pressed again and bc I was aware of this incident happening in 2019 I did the same thing and ran my car off the road. My kids were scared. Now all these issues have been a issue with Chevy and they even had a class action lawsuit against them for the throttle sensor issue. My car wasn't part of the recall but my car has suffered the same issues they've know about for years. I called Thornton Road chevy and they told me it's nothing they can do. I've also emailed the CEO and all others for CHEVY. I want chevy to repair my car before this car KILLS ME OR MY KIDS.",

They do some temporary fix and it\u2019s good for a month or two then the problem persists. I\u2019ve dodged very close attempts at death due to this. Driving on the highway or interstate (at respected speed) and then suddenly the car just slows down abruptly. Scared me half to death due to the fact that I\u2019m on busy roadways. I\u2019ve managed to get over on the shoulder or nearest exit without collision. One time is happened on a turnpike and I came like inches away from hitting the wall. For all of those times I was able to cut the engine off for a bit and then worked good enough to get home or to a shop. For this last time though was the worst. I was in the turning lane of busy intersection and the car like pulled as I was making the turn and then it just cut off. Causing cars to have to swerve around me which could\u2019ve caused other incidents. I turned the car on and off many times but I still could not regain normal speed. It wouldn\u2019t pass 18 then 27 and finally 36. I had to ride with the hazards on and what was supposed to be a 20 minute drive ended up being a 60 minute drive (after sitting in a parking lot for hours). I have lost one job due to the fact that I had to call off so many days. I have lost privileges at other jobs that effects how I\u2019m able to provide for my family. So this is really hitting me hard. Most mechanics seem to know what the problem is but no one has actually fixed it directly. I hope GM does something about this please. This is my first and only car and I\u2019m proud of it, but far as the performance. It\u2019s a death trap. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t allow anyone to ride with me or drive it, because I just never know. I would rather be in the car when something bad happens than someone else. It\u2019s feels like a stick shift/like a sticky clutch or something of that nature when I drive.I don\u2019t know much about cars but that\u2019s not right",

I have wasted countless hours already, in the very short time the error has occurred, having to shift out of park, reverse, drive, back into park, and keep trying over and over and over and over and over and over and over, until it finally might register. One evening, it took over two hours for this to work. This is a HUGE risk to me, especially in the city I live in, as a single woman.   Furthermore, the fact that GM and NHTSA have a service bulletin on this, and it is a *known* issue in my year, make, and model, on top of the thousands and thousands of online forums reporting this same issue, tells me that this is much, much larger than anyone (especially GM) would like to admit, and that my car needs to be included in the recall for this.",

FAST FORWARD TO WHAT HAS LEAD ME TO FILING A VEHICLE SAFETY COMPLAINT, THIS EVENING MY SON WAS DRIVING ON US 22 WHEN HE CALLED ME IN A PANIC BECAUSE WHILE DRIVING A WARNING DISPLAYED ON THE DASH ENGIN POWER REDUCED,  TRACTION LIGHT AND ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE SPEED REDUCED TO ABOUT 20 AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE. I TOLD HIM TO PUT ON THE HAZARD LIGHTS AND PULL OVER02 AS SOON AS IT WAS SAFE. HE DID AS I SAID AS I WAITED ON THE PHONE WITH HIM. HE TURNED THE CAR OFF AND LET IT REST FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. THE CAR STARTED BACK UP WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. THE TRACTION LIGHT WENT OFF BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON. HE MADE IT HOME WITHOUT ANY MORE INCIDENTS. AS I STATED ABOVE YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

I HAVE CALLED CHEVY NUMEROUS OF TIMES COMPLAING THAT THIS VEHICLE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT. I BELIEVE THEY HAVE JUST ABOUT REPLACED EVERY PART EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKES, ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION AND I A SURE THOSE ARE GOING TO BE NEXT. I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS VEHICLE HOWEVER, IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG. I JUST TOOK IT IN FOR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AGAIN AND NOISE FROM REAR END SOUNDING LIKE A STRUT. AND THEY FOUND ISSUE WITH KEY THOB CAUSING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, LEAKING STRUT, AND BAD WHEEL BEARINGS. NOW THAT JUST ADDS MORE TO THE LIST. NOT TO MENTION I GET HOME AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS BACK ON AGAIN AND THE NOISE IS SLIGHTLY STILL THERE.

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

AFTER GOING ANOTHER 50 FEET I PRESSED THE BRAKE TO STOP AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AND THE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR BOARD..QUICKLY I PRESSED THE PEDAL AGAIN AND IT WENT TO THE FLOOR FOR THE SECOND TIME.  THE THIRD TIME I PRESSED THE PEDAL AS HARD AS I COULD INTO THE FLOORBOARD.  THERE WAS A VIBRATING SOUND.  NEXT, I PRESSED THE PEDAL FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND FELT THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE AND  IT PERFORMED PROPERLY AND STOPPED THE CAR.  I DROVE A FEW MORE BLOCKS TO MY DESTINATION GOING 10 MILES AN HOUR WITH MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON.  I CALLED MY ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE SERVICE TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE NEXT DAY I EXPLAINED THE EXPERIENCE TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THEY DROVE IT AND SAID THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE EXPERIENCE.  THEY DROVE THE CAR SEVERAL TIMES BUT THEN SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG SO THEY WERE READY TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME. I SAID I'M NOT READY TO TAKE IT BACK AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE GLAD THEY DIDN'T DUPLICATE MY EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE, THEY MIGHT HAVE HURT SOMEONE..  I  CALLED GM AND THEY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME AND SAID HE DROVE IT AND IT PERFORMED NORMALLY.    I ASKED HIM TO CONSULT WITH THE FACTORY OR TRY TO GET A BRAKE SPECIALIST TO LOOK AT IT.  AND I TOLD HIM I WILL NOT DRIVE THE CAR ANOTHER INCH UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND FIX IT.  THEY DID NOT GIVE ME A LONER CAR SO I HAVE RENTED A CAR AT $50 A DAY.    I HOPE TO GET THIS RESOLVED.",

THEY DO NOT LIGHT THE ROADWAY'S SHOULDER FAR ENOUGH TO SEE DEER ON THE SHOULDER OR  CROSSIING THE ROADS UNTIL YOU ARE CLOSER TO THEM,  THEN IN OTHER GM CARS I HAVE HAD AND THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP SHORT. MY PRIOR GM'S CARS, THE HIGH BEAMS AND LOW WERE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO REFLECT OFF THE ANIMALS EYES OR THEIR BODIES. IMPROVED ILLUMINATION WOULD MAKE A SUBSTANCIAL DIFFERENCE AND HELP TO ELIMINATE A SAFETY ISSUE AND OR A POSSIBLE CRASH OR COLLISION. CAN THESE BULBS BE CHANGED OR UPGRADED?     I AM A LOYAL GM CUSTOMER AND HAVE HAD SEVERAL GM CARS, AN 1987 CENTURY, 1989 OLDS CIERA. BOTH OF WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BETTER ILLUMINATION, EVEN BEING MORE THAN 25 YRS OLD. I ACTUALLY JUST REPLACED THE OLDSMOBILE WITH THE MALIBU. I ALSO DRIVE A 2003 SATURN ION WHICH HAS BETTER ILLUMINTION. AS WELL AS A 2016 BUICK VERANO. CAN THIS MATTER BE INVESTIGATED TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO REMEDY THIS THIS, THANK YOU.",

I CAN CURRENTLY DEMONSTRATE WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE, EXCESSIVE POWER TRAIN MOVEMENT ON MY CURRENT 2016 MALIBU WHICH I BELIEVE EXISTS ON OTHER MALIBUS AND OTHER GM MADE MODELS, LIKE CAMARO SS. I HAVE: TURNED OFF ENGINE, OPENED THE HOOD THEN PUSHED AND PULLED THE CAR BACK AND FORTH. THE POWER TRAIN MOVEMENT WAS QUIT NOTICEABLE. I MIGHT PUT A DIAL INDICATOR ON IT TO SEE EXACTLY HOW FAR.  I'LL BE TAKING MY CAR IN TO THE DEALER TO GET THEIR WRITTEN WORD ON MY CURRENT COMPLAINT FOR WHICH I BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN 'THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR CAR' OR ITS 'WORKING AS DESIGNED'. AGAIN, I BELIEVE THE POWER TRAIN MOVEMENT TO BE OUTSIDE OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS. ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY WOULD BE ABLE TO DEEM OTHERWISE. I JUST SO HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT A POWER TRAIN MOUNT ISSUE FEELS LIKE. POWER TRAIN MOVEMENT DURING SHIFTS IS VERY EXTREME ON THIS CAR IN MY OPINION. THE AVERAGE PERSON WOULD THINK THAT IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF. HOWEVER, I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. IT'S THE POWER TRAIN MOUNTS CAUSING IT TO FEEL LIKE A FIRM/JOLTING SHIFT. IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF.    DUE TO THE FACT I'VE HAD 2C 2016 CHEVROLET CARS WITH WHAT I BELIEVE HAD BAD POWER TRAIN MOUNTS, I BELIEVE CHEVROLET HAS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE.
