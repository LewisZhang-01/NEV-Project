        "summary": "Gas tank filler neck.  Definitely available for inspection anytime you want. My safety and the safety of others is put at risk by the manufacture of this gas tank with a metal bar blocking full insertion of any gas station fuel nozzle!  By having this bar there, it blocks full insertion of some gas station hose nozzles, thus prohibiting the rubber cone around the nozzle from pressing on the gas tank and allowing dispensing of gasoline to fill up the tank. So the only way an owner can fill up his gas tank at the gas station is then to manually hold up the rubber cone, which then disconnects the safety device in the hose to enabling fueling of the motorcycle's gas tank! But that is exactly why the gas station has this safety device so no one's life or safety is endangered by gasoline spillage. Indian Motorcycles has GROSSLY endangered people's lives by requiring owners to do this just so they can get gasoline at some gas stations!!!  It needs to be at least another 1 inch lower so this bar doesn't cause this dangerous situation! The dealer informed me that ALL new Indian Motorcycles are being built with this bar blocking full insertion of gas station nozzles, but he didn't know why.  How could they be allowed to do such a dangerous thing?  Now this doesn't happen at ALL gas stations I go to, but at least HALF of all the gas stations I go to require me to manually hold the rubber cone up in order to dispense gasoline!  So some gas station hose/nozzles must be made different than other ones, and this creates a dangerous life threatening situation.  Please order them to do a recall and correct this situation before someone gets badly hurt at a gas station when the gasoline spills, which has happened to me several times now in the only 1,000 miles I've driven this new motorcycle. Thank You",
