ON DECEMBER 27, 2013, I EXPERIENCED LOUD NOISES UNDER THE FRONT HOOD.  I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE SMART CENTER ' GAINESVILLE [FL] (AKA.

THE COST FOR THIS REPAIR WAS $962.65, INCLUDING A COURTESY $50- DISCOUNT.  ON JUNE 22, 2016, I, AGAIN, EXPERIENCED LOUD NOISES UNDER THE FRONT HOOD AND DROVE THE CAR TO THE SMART CENTER ' TAMPA [FL] (AKA. MERCEDES-BENZ OF TAMPA) WHERE THEY FOUND 'CAUSE: RADIATOR FAN IS FAULTY'. [SEE INVOICE 473583, COPY ATTACHED.]  THE ODOMETER READ 93833.  THE COST FOR THIS REPAIR WAS $946.69.  THE INVOICE AT $991.69 INCLUDES A CHARGE OF $45- FOR WINDSHIELD WASHER PUMP REPLACEMENT.  I BELIEVE THE SMART FOR TWO RADIATOR FAN ASSEMBLY IS:  FIRST, DEFECTIVE IN DESIGN BECAUSE REPLACEMENT REQUIRES THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE CAR FRONT END FASCIA, THE BUMPER, THE WIPERS AND WIPER COWL, THE FRONT SUB FRAME, AND THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF BOTH THE AIR CONDITIONING ASSEMBLY (INCLUDING RECOVERY OF REFRIGERANT & REPLACEMENT) AND THE RADIATOR ASSEMBLY (INCLUDING COOLANT REMOVAL & REPLACEMENT);   AND SECOND: DEFICIENT & SUB-STANDARD IN MATERIALS AND/OR MANUFACTURING BECAUSE ITS USABLE LIFE IS EXCEPTIONALLY SHORT.  THE FIRST RADIATOR FAN FAILED AFTER 32 MONTHS / 51,500 MILES AND THE SECOND FAN FAILED AFTER 30 MONTHS / 42,300 MILES.  EACH TIME MY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $950-.  I CAN UNDERSTAND THE FAN ASSEMBLY COSTING APPROXIMATELY $170-; BUT INSTALLATION AT A MERCEDES-BENZ DEALERSHIP FOR OVER $600- IS BOTH OUTRAGEOUS AND A TESTAMENT TO THE MANUFACTURER'S DEFICIENT FORETHOUGHT & DESIGN.",
