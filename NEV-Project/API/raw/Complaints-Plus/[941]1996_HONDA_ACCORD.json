I IMMEDIATELY EASED OFF THE ACCELERATOR, PUNCHED THE EMERGENCY BLINKING LIGHTS AND MADE MY WAY OVER TO THE FREEWAY SHOULDER.

THE NEXT DAY I TOOK UP THE MATTER WITH SEARS WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE TIRES, BUT THE MANAGER THERE PUT IT DOWN TO \"ROAD HAZARD\", AND SINCE I DID NOT PURCHASE \"RH\" INSURANCE WHEN I GOT THE TIRES, HE COULDN'T/WOULDN'T HELP ME AND SUGGESTED I TAKE UP THE MATTER WITH BRIDGESTONE.

SINCE THEN, I HAVE RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED OTHER DRIVERS WHO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH EITHER THIS BRAND NAME AND/OR THIS TIRE LINE.

MODULATOR WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING BRAKE FLUID FROM FITTING ON UNDERSIDE.  I CONTACTED DEALER TO EFFECT REPAIR,AND WAS TOLD A NEW ABS MODULATOR WOULD BE ABOUT $1500-$1600 DOLLARS.  SINCE VEHICLE WAS JUST PAST WARRANTY LIMITS, I INQUIRED IF SOME CONSIDERATION MIGHT BE MADE SINCE IT WAS CONSIDERED A NON-WEAR ITEM. DEALER DENIED ANY CONSIDERATIONS.     UPON FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE MATTER, I DISCOVERED A HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN RELEASED TO DEALERS PRIOR TO MY COMPLAINT THAT ACKNOWLEDGES A PROBLEM WITH \"LEAKING ABS MODULATORS\" HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN # 960-50 JUNE 30,1998. IT STATES THAT THE PLUGS IN THE ABS MODULATOR MAY NOT BE PROPERLY TIGHTENED,AND GOES ON TO DESCRIBE A SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE FIX FOR THIS SYMPTOM.     WHEN I AGAIN CONTACTED THE DEALER AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THIS,THEY AGAIN SAID THEY WOULD FIX IT BY REPLACING THE UNIT FOR $1500-$1600-NO WARRANTY-NO EXCEPTIONS.     I INQUIRED ABOUT THE REGIONAL WARRANTY REPRESENTATIVE,GOT HIS PHONE NUMBER,AND CALLED HIM.    AGAIN I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM,MY CONCERNS,AND THE HONDA ISSUED SERVICE BULLETIN. HE SAID THAT WHILE THE BULLETIN DOES DESCRIBE ONE POSSIBLE FIX FOR THE PROBLEM,THE HONDA DEALERS WERE NOT BOUND TO FOLLOW THAT RECOMMENDED AVENUE OF REPAIR.    IN OTHER WORDS,\"SPEND 1/2 HR. FIXING SOMETHING FOR $100, OR SPEND 1/2 HR FIXING IT FOR $1500\".    I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT,SINCE I WORK IN A CONSUMER RELATED FIELD, AT NO TIME DID I PRESENT MYSELF UNPROFESSIONALLY,OR FAIL TO SHOW RESPECT TO THE PERSON TO WHOM I WAS SPEAKING,AS I BELIEVED THAT ULTIMATELY,\"REASON\" WOULD WIN OUT.  *NM",

I TALKED TO MY HONDA DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WAS AN ABS MODULATOR THAT WOULD COST 1,200+. WHEN I START MY CAR IT MAKES A FUNNY NOISE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN MY ABS LIGHT COMES ON AND THE NOISE STOPS. I WASN'T CONCERNED AT FIRST , BUT I FOUND OUT THAT I COULD CONTACT NHTSA AND SOME ACTION COULD BE TAKEN. IF MY  ABS SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AND I SLAM ON MY BRAKES AND THEY LOCK UP AND I HIT SOMEONE THEN I AM AT FAULT , BUT I COULD NOT HELP HITTING THEM IF MY BRAKES ARE LOCKED UP AND I AM STILL GOING. THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR MAYBE EVEN DEATH. I DO NOT HAVE 1,200+ TO FIX THIS. THE HONDA CO. SHOULDN'T HAVE USED FAULTY PARTS. COULD YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND LET ME KNOW SOMETHING. A GOOD PLACE TO GO TO FIND OUT INFORMATION ON ABS MODUALTORS IS YAHOO.COM. I HAVE  BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS DONE CASE-BY-CASE.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A BLOWN BALANCER SHAFT SEAL.  AFTER EVERYTHING WAS ADDED UP, IT COST $653.80 TO REPAIR.  WE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT TO THE DEALER WHEN THE CAR WAS BEING REPAIRED, BUT WERE TOLD IT WAS A WEARABLE PART THAT WE WERE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE GO.  MY FATHER RECENTLY TOLD ME HE READ IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER AUTOMOTIVE COLUMN THAT A WOMAN HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  I LOOKED UP THE NHTSA WEBSITE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT, AND WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THERE WERE QUITE A FEW.  HAD MY WIFE BEEN DRIVING THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY 15 MONTH OLD SON, AND THE ENGINE FAILED DUE TO LOSS OF OIL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.
