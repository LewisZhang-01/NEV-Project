MADE IT TO THE HIGHWAY TO GO HOME AND WHILE DRIVING AT JUST UNDER 55MPH LIMIT VEHICLE STALLS IN THE PASSING LANE. ALMOST CAUSED A WRECK WITH SEVERAL VEHICLES INCLUDING A SEMI. DIDN'T START FOR A FEW MINUTES. VEHICLE STUTTERED TO START AND BARELY TURNED OVER. AFTER IT STARTED I SAT THERE AND WATCHED THE TACHOMETER, IT WOULD, WITHOUT MYSELF TOUCHING OR DOING ANYTHING, IDLE THEN JUMP A LITTLE AND DIP A LITTLE OVER AND OVER. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO CERTAIN SITUATION OR REASONING FOR WHEN, WHERE OR WHY IT WOULD STALL, COMPLETE RANDOMNESS! HIGHWAY DRIVING, SLOW STOP AND GO CITY DRIVING, REVERSING, IT SEEMS TO DO IT COMPLETELY RANDOMLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY BUT ALWAYS WHILE MOVING ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER. STRAIGHT LINE, TURNING, FAST, SLOW, DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY, CAME INTO TOWN AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP AT ALL THE LIGHTS AND GO BUT THEN OUT OF NO WHERE AGAIN DOING CLOSE TO THE 35MPH LIMIT IT STALLS AGAIN AND THIS TIME I WAS AT A 6 WAY INTERSECTION AND ALMOST HIT ANOTHER MOVING VEHICLE. MY FAMILY WILL NOT BE RIDING IN THIS VEHICLE AGAIN UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE! THIS IS NOT NORMAL OR SAFE! NOT FOR ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROADWAY! I HAVE NO CLUE AS TO WHAT THE ISSUE COULD BE EXCEPT THAT IT'S THE MANUFACTURERS ISSUE. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SINCE. VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN WRECKED, ABOVE AVERAGE MAINTENANCE INTERVALS, COMPLETELY MAINTAINED BUT THIS IS SOMETHING MORE THAN REGULAR 'WEAR AND TEAR' AS ONE WOULD SAY. NOT SAFE AT ALL!! COULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF, MY FAMILY OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH THIS PROBLEM!! NEEDS ATTENTION ASAP! EXTREMELY UNSAFE!",

WITH THE OVERDRIVE ON IT GEARS DOWN EXTREMELY LOW AFTER GOING DOWN TO 2000 RPM'S, AND LOSSES A LOT OF POWER. WHEN PRESSING DOWN THE GAS PEDAL, IT CHUGS AND JERKS SEVERELY. I HAVE TO LET OFF THE GAS AND THEN REAPPLY THE GAS TO STOP IT FROM JERKING. ALSO, THE POWER STEERING POPS AND MAKES NOISES. I GOT IN THE CAR TODAY AND HAD NO BRAKE POWER AT ALL. THEN HAD NO BRAKES UNLESS I PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN WITH EXTREME FORCE. AND IT WAS STILL EXTREMELY HARD TO STOP MY VEHICLE. UPON SEARCHING ONLINE, I AM FINDING THAT THESE ARE VERY COMMON ISSUES WITH THE 2008 FORD EDGE VEHICLES. THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF RECALL ON THIS MODEL OF FORD EDGE WHEN THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM, IN MY OPINION. I DID A SEARCH FOR MY VIN NUMBER AND IT SHOWS \"NO\" RECALLS FOR MY VEHICLE.

THE FIRST ONE, MADE IN DECEMBER 2017, DOES NOT SHOW UP UNDER THE COMPLAINTS SECTION, WHICH MAKES IT SEEM LIKE PERHAPS ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE NOT RECORDED APPROPRIATELY BY THE NHTSA!  THE FIRST NOTIFICATION OF THE AIRBAG RECALL WAS RECEIVED IN JULY 2016.  EACH TIME I HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN TOLD REPLACEMENT AIRBAGS ARE STILL UNAVAILABLE FOR MY 2008 FORD EDGE.  I SEE ON THIS SITE THAT SOME OWNERS HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER TELLING THEM NOT TO USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, AS THE REASON WE PURCHASED THE FORD EDGE WAS SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH SEATS TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE THE AIRBAGS, ACCORDING TO THE VEHICLE'S MANUAL, AND I AM TERRIFIED  THE AIRBAG WILL CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURIES TO ME, MY SPOUSE, ONE OF MY CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN.  IT IS TAKING A TOLL ON MY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING WHENEVER I HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR. I CANNOT SELL MY CAR THRU CARMAX OR ONE OF THE OTHER SITES, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ACCEPT VEHICLES WITH UNADDRESSED RECALLS. AND IT WOULD BE MORALLY AND ETHICALLY WRONG TO SELL A DANGEROUSLY DEFECTIVE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT DISCLOSING THE AIRBAG DEFECT.  AND WHO WOULD WANT TO BUY A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE!

THERE WAS ONLY 62,000 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME BUT THE WARRANTY EXPIRED BECAUSE IT WAS MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS. THE OSS WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF 750.00.

I KEEP SEEING ON NBC NIGHTLY NEWS AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT THE CARS THAT WILL BE GETTING AIR BAGS REPLACED FIRST ARE THOSE IN THE SOUTH WHERE ITS HOT AND HUMID.  THIS WEATHER IS NOT GOOD FOR THESE RECALLED AIR BAGS.  WELL MY DAUGHTER GOES TO COLLEGE IN GAINESVILLE FLORIDA WHERE ITS 100 DEGREES AND 90% HUMIDITY IN THE SUMMERS.  SHE HAS ALREADY SPENT A SUMMER UP THERE WITH THE RECALLED AIR BAG AND IS GOING TO SPEND ANOTHER SUMMER THERE WORKING.  WE ARE VERY CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY AS WELL AS HER YOUNG ADULT PASSENGERS.  COLLEGE STUDENTS ALWAYS HAVE MULTIPLE PASSENGERS IN THEIR CARS AND THIS WORRIES ME SO MUCH.  THE SAFETY OF HER FRIENDS IS IN JEOPARDY.  JUST BECAUSE ITS HER CAR DOESN'T MEAN SHE IS NOT A PASSENGER IN HER OWN CAR.  THERE ARE MANY TIMES SOMEONE ELSE WAS DRIVING AND SHE IS NOW THE PASSENGER.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THE REPAIR OF THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IN HER CAR.  SHE LIVES IN AN AREA THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THESE AIR BAGS ALREADY REPAIRED.  THIS COMING JULY WILL BE 1 YR SINCE WE RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER.  I AM AFRAID THAT A LAW SUIT WILL BE COMING WHEN SOMEONE GETS INJURED AS I HAVE SUBMITTED MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS MANY MANY PHONE CALLS TO FORD AND NHTSA.  IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKING THIS LONG ESPECIALLY WHERE THE CAR IS.  I HOPE TO BE RECEIVING THE LETTER IN THE MAIL THAT HER NEW AIR BAG IS READY TO BE INSTALLED AND TO TAKE IT TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALER.

AFTER I STOP THE CAR AND TRY TO TAKE OFF AGAIN IT HAS NO PICKUP. TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO BE STUCK IN 5TH GEAR OR OVERDRIVE. TACH GOES UP TO 2500 RPM BUT VEHICLE BARELY MOVES. WHEN I SHIFT FROM PARK TO DRIVE OR REVERSE THE ENGINE/TRANSMISSION MAKES A HORRIBLE CLUNKING NOISE THAT MAKES ME THINK IT WILL COME OUT OF THE BODY. THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THE CAR DRIVEABLE AGAIN IS TO DISCONNECT BATTERY FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN RECONNECT. EVERYTHING RESETS AND WORKS BUT OCCURS AGAIN-SOMETIMES A WEEK LATER, SOMETIMES A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, AND IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY 17-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER LAST WEEK. MY HUSBAND HAD TO GO OUT AND DISCONNECT THE BATTERY TO SHE COULD SAFELY DRIVE BACK HOME. AND IT IS VERY RANDOM WHEN IT HAPPENS. I DRIVE HIGHWAYS AND COUNTY ROADS FOR WORK AND SOMETIMES THERE IS NOWHERE TO PULL OVER! I'M A NURSE AND A PARAMEDIC...I DONT WANT TO BE A PATIENT!  IT HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND A FIX FOUND!!! I CAN'T AFFORD A NEW CAR. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE!!   WHEN THE OTHER DRIVER TALKED ABOUT PUTTING INTO GEAR AFTER THE RESTART, THE VEHICLE LITERALLY LURCHES FORWARD OR BACKWARD!!!

AFTER HAVING IT TOWED, I WAS TOLD THAT THE WATER PUMP HAD CRACKED. THE WATER PUMP INVOLVED A LOT OF LABOR AND COST ME ABOUT $1100-$1200 WITH THE TOW. ABOUT A WEEK LATER, I WAS AGAIN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND THE CAR STALLED. AGAIN, I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY OFF THE FREEWAY BEFORE THE CAR DIED COMPLETELY. ONCE AGAIN, I HAD TO HAVE THE CARE TOWED. THIS TIME, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE APPEARED TO HAVE COOLANT IN THE OIL AND CREATED A MURKY GOO. MY ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. ANOTHER $2200. THE LAST INCIDENT WAS FRIDAY, MAY 20TH. I HAD NO INDICATION THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF ANY KIND. I LITERALLY DROVE LESS THAN HALF A MILE WHEN THE CARE OVERHEATED AND STALLED.  I CALLED AND EMAILED FORD TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY ASSISTANCE, BUT HAVE EITHER HAVE HAD NO RESPONSE OR AN EMAIL INDICATING THAT IF THE CAR IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY OR IF NO RECALLS HAVE BEEN ISSUED, I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE. I AM OUT OF MONEY AND OPTIONS. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS AND FEEL INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS SITUATION.

THEN MAJOR ENGINE FAILURE, INSTANTLY THE OIL LIGHT WENT ON AND WITHIN SECONDS THE MOTOR OVERHEATED.  THERE WAS A TERRIBLE NOISE AS I FOUND MY WAY TO A SAFE SPOT TO STOP THE CAR.    THIS IS THE MOST BASIC KIND OF IRRESPONSIBILITY IN CREATING AN EXPENSIVE PRODUCT LIKE A CAR.  AMERICAN COMPANIES OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC NOT TO FOIST A HUGE DESIGN DEFECT ON AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC AND SHOULD WILLINGLY PAY 100% OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

CAR OVERHEATED DUE TO THIS. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SEASONED MECHANICS AND FORD, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO THIS CAR WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MILEAGE. THE WAY THIS CAR WAS ENGINEERED, IT IS A $2300+ REPAIR - FOR A WATER PUMP! SPOKE WITH FORD SEVERAL TIMES ASKING FOR THEM TO STEP-UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. GOT NO HELP EXCEPT I SHOULD KEEP MY RECEIPTS. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN FORD.\"  *TR",

I SHIFTED INTO PARK AND BACK INTO DRIVE AND THE VEHICLE FINALLY GOT GOING AGAIN WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS NOTED ABOVE.  IT SEEMS TO REACT THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE OD IS ENGAGED OR DISENGAGED.

I BELIEVE BY READING THE BLOGS THAT THIS IS A LARGE ISSUE THAT FORD KNOWS ABOUT BUT REFUSES TO ADMIT BAD TRANSMISSION DESIGN AND WILL NOT RECALL.

I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GET THROUGH THE QUICKLY APPROACHING TRAFFIC, WITHOUT GETTING HIT OR SOMEONE ELSE GETTING HIT AS THE CARS WEAVED AROUND ME. AT A STOP, I SHIFTED INTO LOW WITH NO CHANGE. I TURNED THE OVER DRIVE ON AND OFF WITH NO CHANGE. I SHIFTED INTO REVERSE AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIG BANG AND THE WHOLE CAR SHOOK (THIS WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT I FELT ON THE FREEWAY WHEN I THOUGHT I HIT A BUMP). SHIFTING BACK INTO DRIVE, IT WAS THE SAME, LOTS OF RPM AND VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT FORWARD, AS IF I WAS STARTING IN FOURTH GEAR. TURNING OFF THE ENGINE I LOOKED FOR ANY SIGNS OF FLUID LEAKING OR OTHER INDICATIONS OF DAMAGE. NOTHING WAS EVIDENT. AFTER STARTING THE CAR AND SHIFTING IT INTO DRIVE, IT WORKED JUST FINE. AN INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF POSTINGS AND EVEN A FEW YOU-TUBE VIDEOS OF THE ACTUAL PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED. FORD EVEN HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN 103100 DATED 4/24/13. POSTINGS REPORT TRANSMISSION REBUILDS (AT OVER $4,000.00) AND THE PROBLEM STILL RECURRED. SUCCESSFUL REPAIRS SEEM TO CENTER AROUND A FIRMWARE, COMPUTER UPGRADE AND REPLACEMENT OF TURBINE SENSORS AND SOLENOIDS.  WITH ONLY 70,000 MILES ON THIS CAR I SHOULD NOT BE HAVING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND SAID IT WOULD TAKE THREE DAYS TO REPAIR AT JUST UNDER $1,000.00. HE ALSO SAID THAT THEY STOCK THE PARTS FOR THIS REPAIR (A STRANGE COMMENT). ON THE INTERNET I FOUND THAT MOST REPAIRS TOOK WEEKS BECAUSE NONE OF THE DEALERS STOCKED THE PARTS. NOW IT SEEMS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS SO PREVALENT THAT MANY IF NOT ALL THE DEALERS ARE NOW STOCKING THESE PARTS.  *TR",

PRIOR TO THE SERVICE, MY WIFE HAD BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE NOISE SO I DECIDED TO REPLACE THE REAR BRAKES PADS.  THE BRAKE PADS WERE ONLY MAYBE 20 % WORN BUT I WENT AHEAD AND REPLACED THEM ANYWAY.  MY WIFE HAD MADE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST WHICH PROMPTED ME TO CHECK AND REPLACE THE FRONT BRAKES A FEW YEARS AGO.  IN JULY 2013 THE NOISE PERSISTED SO WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO CHECK THE PROBLEM.  THE FORD MECHANIC DETERMINED THAT THE FRONT WHEEL BEARINGS WERE FAILING.  APPARENTLY, THERE IS A FLAW IN DESIGN OR WORKMANSHIP THAT IS ALLOWING WATER TO ENTER THE BEARING HOUSING AND TO CORRODE THE BEARING INNER AND OUTER RACE.  SO, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE POTENTIAL FOR THE BEARINGS TO OVER HEAT AND LOCKUP THE WHEELS.  THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY GIVEN THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE BEARINGS TO CORRODE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.  I REQUESTED THE OLD PARTS AFTER THE REPAIR AND THERE IS OBVIOUS CORROSION ON THE BALL BEARINGS, THE BEARING RACE, AND IN THE GREASE.  THERE ARE OTHER FORD CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE NOISE GETS PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER TIME THAT EVENTUALLY YOU CAN HEAR IT OVER THE RADIO AND CONVERSATIONS IN THE CAR.  *TR",

FORD HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. MY CAR IS AT 93,500 MILES AND THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT BE GOING OUT ALREADY. I WISH THEY WOULD RECALL THIS CAR COMPLETELY.

THE TRANSMISSION COULD ALSO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC SINCE YOU HAVE TO HIT THE GAS AND BRAKE QUICKLY. MY WIFE WAS BACKING UP IN THE RAIN AND HAD TO PRESS THE GAS PEDAL TO GET GOING BACKWARDS AND HER 2008 FORD EDGE ACCELERATED TOO MUCH AND SHE HIT MY TRUCK AND AFTER SHE HAD HIT MY TRUCK THAT IS WHEN THE BACKUP SENSORS WENT OFF.  THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO FORD'S ATTENTION AND THE POSSIBLE DANGERS AND EVERYONE GETS THE SAME ANSWER FROM FORD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  FORD STATES \"THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM, THIS IS A NEW DESIGN AND EACH OF US ARE THE FIRST ONES TO HAVE A PROBLEM AND NO ONE ELSE HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT IT\".

IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ANY FOREIGN OBJECT. WE HEARD A LOUD POP, WHICH MY HUSBAND THOUGHT WAS A GUN SHOT. HE FELT THE SHADE AND COULD FEEL PIECES OF GLASS WEIGHING THE SHADE DOWN. HE PULLED OVER TO INSPECT THE ROOF. THE ENTIRE GLASS WAS SHATTERED, BUT STICKING TOGETHER FOR THE MOST PART. THE EDGES WERE CRUMBLING AS WERE PARTS THROUGHOUT IN THE CENTER. AS WE DROVE HOME MORE PIECES OF GLASS STARTED CRUMBLING OFF. FORTUNATELY THE SHADE WAS CLOSED AT THE TIME OR THE PIECES OF GLASS WOULD HAVE LANDED ON MY HUSBAND WHILE DRIVING AND ON MY INFANT SON AND ME IN THE BACK SEAT. WE WERE ALSO FORTUNATE THAT IT WAS NOT RAINING AT THAT MOMENT (ALTHOUGH IT DID LATER THAT EVENING). THE DEALERSHIP HAD CLOSED FOR THE WEEKEND, SO I WAITED UNTIL FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING AND TOOK THE CAR IN. I HAVE THE STANDARD BUMPER-TO-BUMPER WARRANTY, AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND A MAINTENANCE PACKAGE ON THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, FORD CLAIMS THAT THE ROOF IS NOT COVERED BY ANY OF THOSE BECAUSE IT IS GLASS. I FIND IT HIGHLY UNUSUAL THAT THE GLASS USED FOR A ROOF WOULD NOT BE MADE OF DURABLE GLASS SIMILAR TO A WINDSHIELD, GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ROCK HITTING IT OR FALLING HAIL. HAD THE SHADE BEEN OPEN OR HAD THE WEATHER CONDITIONS BEEN BAD, THE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT SEVERAL SUNROOFS ON THE FORD ESCAPE HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH SHATTERING WITHOUT PROVOCATION AS WELL. MY DEALERSHIP OFFERED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE $1300 REPLACEMENT COST GIVEN THAT FORD REFUSED TO COVER ANY OF THE COSTS AND GIVEN ITS DESIRE TO MAINTAIN GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONS.
