I DID TRY INSTALLING THE ENHANCED BRACE THAT TIES THE SWAY BAR MOUNTS/ANCHOR POINTS TO A NEW BEARING SUPPORTING AN EXTENSION ON THE PITTMAN ARM SHAFT AND I ALSO HAD THE FRONT END COMPONENTS CHECKED, ALIGNED AND TIRES BALANCED TO NO AVAIL, THOUGH THE BRACE KIT SEEMED TO HELP. IT IS HARD TO PREDICT WHEN A BUMP IN THE ROAD WILL SET IT OFF BUT THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED I BARELY KEPT IT FROM PULLING INTO THE NEXT LANE BEFORE I GOT IT SLOWED AND CONTROLLED. I NOW TRY TO MINIMIZE MY TIME ON THE FREEWAY IN MY COMMUTE TO/FROM WORK.",

        "summary": "`LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER DODGE RAM OWNERS, I HAVE A SEVERELY CRACKING AND COLLAPSED DASHBOARD IN MY 2000 RAM 1500.  THE CRACKING STARTED AROUND 60KMI AND HAD STARTED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE ORIGINATING FROM THE BOLTS SECURING THE UPPER DASH TO THE INSIDE FIREWALL.  EVENTUALLY A CRACK WILL FORM FROM ALL OF THE BOLTS, WITH SOME CRACK CONNECTING WITH OTHERS CAUSING PIECES OF THE DASH TO COLLAPSE. ONCE THIS HAPPENS, THE UPPER (5) BOLTS WILL BE PROVIDING NO SUPPORT TO ANY PART OF THE DASH, EXCEPT FOR THOSE PIECES DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE BOLTS.  THIS VEHICLE WAS ASSEMBLED IN THE MEXICO PLANT.    I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE INSTALLATION. MY THEORY IS THAT WHEN THE DASH IS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED, THE DASH IS RESTED UPON (2) BOLTS AT THE BOTTOM UNDER THE SIDE KICKPLATES AND THEN THE TOP (5) ARE USED TO BRING THE DASH INTO ITS FINAL RESTING POSITION. WHILE DOING THIS, THERE MAY STILL BE RESIDUAL FORCES ON THOSE TOP BOLTS PULLING THE DASH DOWN EVEN AFTER THE (2) LOWER BOLTS ARE TIGHTENED. THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE TO PUSH OR HOLD THE DASH IN PLACE UNTIL THE LOWER (2) BOLTS ARE TIGHTENED AND THEN THE TOP (5) BOLTS ARE THERE ONLY TO SECURE THE UPPER DASH ONLY. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND INSTALLING A CENTER SHIMMY BRACE THAT WOULD BE USED TO POSITION THE ASSEMBLY IN THE FINAL RESTING POSITION THAT WOULD CONNECT BETWEEN THE DASH SUBFRAME AND THE INSIDE FIREWALL. ONCE IN POSITION THE DASH THE LOWER (2) BOLTS CAN BE TORQUED. THEN THE (5) TOP BOLTS WOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTING TO HOLD THE DASH IN PLACE.    I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY HAZARD DURING AN EVENT WHERE THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG IS DEPLOYED AND POTENTIAL SHARP PIECES OF THE CRACKED DASHBOARD ARE THROWN ABOUT THE CAB AREA. *TR",

I RECENTLY WENT TO ANOTHER DEALER TO GET A QUOTE OF OVER $1000 TO REPAIR. THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT CHRYSLER HAS BEEN FIXING THESE TRUCKS IF THE ORIGINAL OWNER STILL OWNS IT REGARDLESS OF WARRANTY EXPIRATION. BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT FAILURE. SO I THEN CALL THE 800 NUMBER GIVEN ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT IT IS BASICALLY TOO LATE NOW BECAUSE MY TRUCK IS 8 YRS OLD. THIS WAS HARD TO SWALLOW BECAUSE I TRIED TO REPAIR IT UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WHEN ONLY 2 YRS OLD. I AM VERY, VERY DIS-SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE OF CHRYSLER CORP.

I BOUGHT THE TRUCK IN FEB 04 WITH 74,000 MILES ON IT AND SHORTLY AFTER I NOTICED A CRACK IN THE DASHBOARD, SINCE THEN THE DASH IS FALLING APART AND IS MORE BRITTLE THAN A SPORTING CLAY. IF YOU SNAP OFF A PIECE AND LOOK AT IT YOU CAN SEE THAT ABOUT 1/5TH OF THE WAY DOWN FROM THE TOP IS BROWN SINCE IT HAS COOKED IN THE SUN. SO THAT PROVES THAT DODGE USES VERY CHEAP PLASTIC FOR THE DASHBOARDS. I LOOKED INTO REPLACING IT ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO AND THE TOP PIECE OF THE DASH COST ABOUT 200$ AND NOW THAT I HAVE GOTTEN MY TAX RETURNS BACK I WAS GOING TO GET A NEW ONE BUT THE PRICE IS NOW 375$. I GUESS DODGE FINALLY REALIZED THE PROBLEM WITH THESE DASHBOARDS AND DECIDED TO CASH IN ON THEM.  THE TORQUE CONVERTER WENT OUT ON THE DRIVE HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP ALSO, BUT 50 BUCKS FROM ME AND 2100$ FROM THE WARRANTY PEOPLE FIXED THAT.   SECOND IS THE ASD RELAY WHICH MEANS AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN RELAY AND IT ISN'T KIDDING WITH THE NAME. A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED MY TRUCK IT WOULD SHUT OFF RIGHT AWAY AND WOULDN'T RUN RIGHT UNTIL I FEATHERED THE GAS FOR A LITTLE BIT, AFTER REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY CONTROL SOLENOID, THE IDLE AIR CONTROL MOTOR AND MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR I DID A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH AND FOUND IT TO BE A 10 DOLLAR RELAY FROM NAPA.  THE THIRD PROBLEM IS A WHOOPING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE THAT I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. THE TRUCK MAKES THE NOISE WHEN ITS SITTING STILL SO I KNOW ITS NOTHING IN THE SUSPENSION, ALTHOUGH ITS LOUDER WHEN IDLING OVER SMALL BUMPS.  THE FOURTH WAS THE SPEED SENSOR IN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL, ABS AND BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON BUT DIDN'T AFFECT PERFORMANCE AT ALL, REPLACED THE SENSOR AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE FROM IT.  FIFTH PROBLEM IS THE BACK WINDOW LEAKS BUT I'M GOING TO FIX THAT WITH A GENEROUS BLOB OF WELDER GLUE INSIDE WHEN I FINALLY GET AROUND TO PULLING THE HEADLINER DOWN.  *TR",

I HAPPENED TO CATCH A NEWS STORY ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE, THAT THIS SEEMED  TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE DODGE TRUCKS ALONG WITH POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. YOU CAN CONTACT SCOOPER@LOCAL6.COM FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE DATA HE HAS COLLECTED CONCERNING THIS ISSUE.  IF WOULD SEEM DODGE NEEDED  TO LOOK IN TO THE PROBLEM.  *AK",

WHEN I LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS WAS MY 4TH DODGE TRUCK AND I HAVE OWNED ALL OF THEM IN FL, ONE WAS RED AND THE OTHER 3 WERE ALL BLACK AS WELL AND THEY NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS, THEY JUST GOT REALLY QUIET AND TRIED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

THERE WERE 3 OF US IN THE TRUCK IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ON I-95 I DONT KNOW IF WE WOULD STILL BE HERE. DODGE BUILT THESE TRUCKS KNOWING THERE WAS A DEFECT IN THE REAR END ALONG WITH MINE THERE WERE 5 OTHERS WITH IN MILES OF EACH OTHER ALL WITH THE SAME REAR END PROBLEM. I CONTACTED DODGE AND ASK THEM WHY THIS PROBLEM HASD NOT BEEN FIXED OR RECALLED THERE ANSWER WAS THEY DID NOT CARE. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN DODGE RAMS WITH A POSI REAR END WE GOT LUCKY BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MILLIONS WHO HAVE ONE OF THESE TRUCKS. MY TRUCK IS A 2000 AND I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS FINALLY CORRECTED IN 2003. SO THIS PROBLEM IS IN 96-98 TO 2002 THATS A LOT OF TRUCKS BARRELING DOWN THE STREETS THAT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THE DRIVERS CAN LOSE TOTAL CONTROL OF WITH OUT ANY WARNING. THINK OF THE ACCIDENTS A 1/2 TON OR 3/4 TUN TRUCK WILL CAUSE WHEN YOU CANT STEER IT OR IF YOU LOSE THE REAR AXLE AND YOUR TIRES GO ROLLING DOWN THE ROAD WITH OUT THE TRUCK.

ACCORDING TO YOUR RECALL, MY BAD TIE ROD ENDS, SHOCKS, AND CONTROL ARM ARE A RESULT OF A BAD AXLE.  THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THIS ALL HAPPENED FROM THE CONTROL GOING BAD.  THE TRUCK HAD ONLY 100,000 MILES AT THE TIME,THIS COST ME 1,500.00.  THE TRUCK IS NOW STARTING TO HAVE THE SAME NOISES AS A YEAR AGO.  COULD THIS BE THE RECURRING PROBLEM,SHOULD I JUST KEEP REPLACING THE RIGHT SIDE CONTROL ARM. MY TRUCK IS ALL ROAD MILES,NO FOUR WHEELING, NO TOWING, NO ACCIDENTS.  WHAT YOU HAVE POINTED OUT I FEEL IS MORE PREVALENT THAN 76 VEHICLES.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY STATED THERE IS NO RECALL OF THIS KIND FOR MY TRUCK, THEN WHY IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE AND WHY IS IT EXACTLY AS YOU HAVE STATED. I FEEL YOU ARE RIGHT,I FEEL THERE IS A PROBLEM, I ALSO FEEL PUTTING ON NEW CONTROL ARMS DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM WHICH I FEEL IS RETURNING AND I FEAR ANOTHER 1,500.00 BILL IS ON IT'S WAY.

THE ESTIMATED DAMAGES CAME TO BE AROUND $8,900.00. WHEN THE TRUCK WAS FIXED AND MY HUSBAND WAS TO GO AND PICK IT UP, WE RECIEVED A CALL THAT THE GATE IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAD HIT MY DRIVER SIDE DOOR. WELL IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FIX THE DOOR, THEY HAD TO TAKE OFF THE HEATED MIRROR. SINCE THAT WAS DONE AND WE GOT THE TRUCK BACK, WE COULD NO LONGER USE THE HEATED MIRRORS,HEATER, OR THE AIRCONDITIONING. WE HAD TO TAKE THE FUSE OUT BECAUSE THE SWITCH WOULD STAY ON. THE FUSE WOULD NOT BLOW OUT IT WOULD JUST STAY ON. WITH THE SWITCH STAYING ON THE WIRING IN THE DASH WOULD CATCH FIRE. THE PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT END IS THAT THE TIRES ON THE RIGHT, AND LEFT SIDE ARE BEING CUT INTO. THIS WAS NOT ACCURING BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. WE PUT TWO SETS OF NEW TIRES ON THE TRUCK IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THE TRUCK BACK IN THE SHOP TO BE FIXED. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD PUT TO BIG OF A TIRE ON THE TRUCK, THAT WAS THE CAUSE FOR THE TIRES BEING CUT. BUT WE STILL HAD OUR WINDOW STICKER FROM WHEN WE BOUGHT THE TRUCK AND SHOWED THEM THAT WITH THE OPTIONS PACKAGE ON THE TRUCK THAT SIZE OF TIRE IS WHAT CAME ON THE TRUCK. EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THE TRUCK NOW IS STILL THINGS THAT DIDN'T GET CHECKED AND FIXED FROM THE ACCIDENT. THEY ARE SAYING IT ISN'T ACCIDENT RELATED. I HAVE A 5 YEAR OLD AND A 3 YEAR OLD. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE. MY HUSBAND AND I WENT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER TRUCK FOR THAT REASON. OUR ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND NOT FEELING SAFE DRIVING IT WAS A PROBLEM. THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TRUCK. APPARENTLY THERE IS FOR THE TIRES TO BE GETTING CUT. WITH IT BEING THE SAME SIZE TIRE THAT CAME ON THE TRUCK.

I STATED I HAD ALLERGY TESTING DONE WHICH CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR MOLD & MILDEW AND I WAS HAVING HEALTH PROBLEMS DUE TO THIS CONDITION AND COULD NOT USE MY VEHICLE. THIS TIME THE DEALER CLEANED AND DEODERIZED THE CARPET AND TOLD ME TO REMOVE THE RUBBER MATS, WHICH I DID. THERE WAS NO MOISTURE UNDER THE MATS. I DO NOT HAVE PETS NOR DO I SMOKE, NO CHILDREN. THIS IS A PERSONAL VEHICLE THAT IS NOT USED FOR WORK. I AM A RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF VEHICLE IS ALWAYS KEPT IMMACUATELY CLEAN. THE RUBBER MATS I HAD BOUGHT WERE OF GOOD QUALITY AND ARE AFTERALL, MADE OF INERT RUBBER WHICH DID NOT GIVE OFF ANY ODOR WHATSOEVER. ON MAY 24TH I WENT TO THE DEALER, STATED THAT I HAVE KEPT THE MATS OUT AND THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND I WAS STILL GETTING A MUSTY ODOR WHICH WAS MAKING ME SICK. DEALER SPRAYED A FOAMING PRODUCT MANUFACTURED BY PETRO CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, INC. INTO THE DRAIN OUTLET AND ALSO SPRAYED SOME CONDITION AIR AUTOMOTIVE REFRESHENER ALSO BY THAT SAME COMPANY. I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE DEALER NOT TO USE THE MAX A/C SETTING BUT TO USE THE OUTSIDE AIR WHICH IS IN CONTRADICTION TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL WHICH STATES, \"SELECT MAX A/C WHEN THE OUTSIDE AIR CONTAINS SMOKE, ODORS OR HIGH HUMIDITY. THIS FEATURE ALLOWS FOR RECIRCULATION OF INTERIOR AIR ONLY.\" TWO OTHER DEALERS THAT I CALLED UP TO GET THEIR OPINION ON MY PROBLEM, INFORMED ME TO SPRAY A CAN OF LYSOL INTO THE INTAKE (I'M SURE THE EPA WOULD FIND THIS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE TO BE INHALING THIS WITHIN A CONFINED AREA).
