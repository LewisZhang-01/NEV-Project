There is such an alert on newer models (2021-2022) I went to a local dealership to check.

As I was traveling on a downhill slope at approximately 60mph my engine abruptly died with no warning, causing an immediate loss of power steering, power brakes, and engine brake.  I began applying heavy pressure to the brakes slowing the vehicle and began looking for a side road to pull into. I came upon a driveway with an open gate into a field. With much manual force to the steering wheel and brakes I was able to guide the truck and trailer off of the highway into the field to a stop. I was fortunate to not have anyone stopping in front of me as I am certain I would not have been able to avoid a crash with the heavy load and no power. The vehicle was towed to a local Ram dealer and metal shavings were discovered in my fuel system. Repairs were made under warranty and after 6 weeks my truck was returned to me with a new fuel system including a new Cp4 fuel pump that had failed. This happened on 08/28/2020 and the truck had 8900 miles at the time. On 09/15/2021 I discovered metal shavings in my rear fuel filter while doing routine maintenance The truck was running appropriately with no codes or warning lights,  it had 72000 miles at the time. I telephoned a local Ram dealer shop and was told it would have to be diagnosed at their shop. Unwilling to take the chance with another Cp4 pump failing I contacted a local diesel shop and was advised to replace the Cp4 with a Cp3 pump.  I purchased a new Bosch Cp3 fuel pump specifically modified for replacement of Cp4 pumps in Ram trucks and paid the local shop myself to do the work.

I paid $900 and I believe that my truck had something wrong with braking system also.  Like I explained before. In both situations my CP4 subtlety blowups and stop my truck in middle of freeway. Truck engine shutoff and in 65 mph freeway this is very dangerous. God save my life in both situations because all the tomes someone come to help me.

I do not know if mine will be next to go or ever will go but FCA has a solution in the 2021 HD Ram trucks and that is the CP-ISB21 fuel pump which looks like the old reliable CP3 fuel pump. Companies out have a solution and that is the CP3 swap but it voids the warranty on the vehicle. The warranty is what is holding me back from having the CP3 pump swap done. Can you please pressure FCA to step up have integrity to replace the plagued CP4 fuel pump with the CP-ISB21 pump. I have challenged FCA on their integrity and ask them if they have it because of the cookie cutter answers I have received from them. I have even asked them to look up what integrity is and to follow the integrity example from the Naval Nuclear Power Program because that program is built on integrity. That program has safely steamed on Nuclear Power for over 60 years. Please again force FCA\u2019s hand on this because this is unsat of them. Look at the forums online and you will see people posting their trucks that have a failed CP4 pump. With that failure FCA is just replacing it another CP4 pump. Also people\u2019s HD rams are down for weeks up to months waiting on the repair.

THE BOSCH CP4.2 FUEL INJECTION PUMP HAS A VERY HIGH RATE OF SUDDEN FAILURE LEADING TO IMMEDIATE STOPPAGE ON THE ENGINE AND ENGINE BRAKING SYSTEM. THE PUMP DESTROYS ITSELF AND TAKES OUT THE REST OF THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM LEADING TO REPAIRS IN THE $20,000 USD RANGE. FCA & RAM HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REVISE THE PUMP IN LATE (JULY) 2020 TO SOLVE THE ISSUE BUT THE FAILURES KEEP OCCURRING. FOR THE 2021 MODEL YEAR, FCA & RAM HAVE CHANGED THE PUMP ENTIRELY AND REVERTED BACK TO USING AN OLDER, SAFER, MORE RELIABLE DESIGN. NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEITHER THE PUMP REVISION IN 2020, NOR THE PUMP CHANGE IN 2021 HAVE BEEN MADE. THE ISSUE IS SO PREVALENT THAT THE REPLACEMENT PUMPS AND REPAIRS GENERALLY HAVE A 30-90 DAY WAIT PERIOD WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS WITHOUT THE PRIMARY VEHICLE. THIS PROBLEM IS A SUBSTANTIATED SAFETY RISK. ACCORDING TO A TEXAS JUDGE IN A BOSCH CP4.2 LAWSUIT, WHEN ANOTHER AUTOMAKER, GM TRIED TO DISMISS THE CASE SAYING THE PUMP FAILURE IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, THE COURT RESPONDED: \"THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF A TRUCK SPONTANEOUSLY STALLING AT HIGH SPEEDS IS NOT A MERE INCONVENIENCE.
