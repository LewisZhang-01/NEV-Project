I did not go to the Dr. because it wasn't severe. However, I do have this on video because we have a dash cam in our van at all times. I found out these were defective, called the FCA and they told me I could go to any Chrysler dealer and I could get it replaced under warranty. So this is what I have done, but its on back order. Also, I wanted them to replace the other side since this could happen again, but they said they could not, unless it deployed. That's unacceptable if you ask me....its a safety issue for sure. This will happen again, just don't know when. Is there anything I can do about this? Thank you so much. FCA has been contacted and warranty number [XXX] and case [XXX] was given.

The check engine light comes on when it is about to stall.  My ASE Certified mechanic read  a P0302 trouble code. This means that #2 cylinder has a misfire.  The mechanic replaced all spark plugs and coils, but the same missfire remains.  The actual problem is a defective cylinder head on the left bank.  This was determined by a cylinder leak-down test, which shows that #2 exhaust valve is leaking compression.  This defective left (#2,4,6 cylinders) cylinder head is well known by all FCA Dealers.  My dealer says that ALL of his mechanics have a great deal of experience doing this defective cylinder head replacement. Tens of thousands of left cylider heads have been replaced under an EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAM, issued and approved by FCA, which extends engine warranties on their 3.6 LITER ENGINES to 10 YEARS or 150,000 miles. When I try to get my vehicle's defective cylinder head replaced under the EXTENDED WARRANTY FCA PROGRAM, FCA says that they will only replace the defective cylinder head on 2011, 2012, and 2013 vehicles !  They will not cover my vehicle ! Please help, before this engine defect causes a major accident for my family.",

After the van has been sitting in a garage, out of the direct sunlight, it is able to latch shut again. This opening and closing occurs while the vehicle is in motion and stopped. Furthermore, there is a seat right next to the door.  Thus, this is a safety risk because the unlatched door poses a risk of injury or death during a collision or accident. The Chrysler dealers have not able to solve this issue and there are countless instances online of other van owners reporting the same issue.

LAST MONDAY (MAY 15, 2017) I WAS DRIVING AND REALIZED THAT NONE OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ON MY VEHICLE WERE WORKING. IT BECAME SCARILY APPARENT WHEN I WENT TO HONK MY HORN AND NOTHING HAPPENED. THE CONDITION ALSO AFFECTED ALL THE OTHER CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL, INCLUDING THE DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER THAT PROVIDES ME INFORMATION ON ALL THE VITAL STATISTICS OF THE VEHICLE. I USE THIS INFORMATION DAILY TO VERIFY THAT MY VEHICLE IS WELL MAINTAINED AND FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. WITHOUT IT, I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT MY VEHICLE'S ROAD WORTHINESS. LACKING JUST THESE TWO ITEMS (NOT TO MENTION LOSING THE OTHER CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL) CAUSED ME SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE HORN. RATHER, I WAS TOLD, THE HORN IS WIRED THROUGH THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH AND THAT SWITCH HAD FAILED. AFTER AGREEING TO HAVE THAT REPAIR DONE, I WAITED FOR THE WORK TO BE COMPLETED SO I COULD SAFELY DRIVE MY VEHICLE AGAIN. BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. A COUPLE HOURS LATER, I RECEIVED ANOTHER CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP STATING THAT IT WASN'T THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH, BUT RATHER, I WAS TOLD, THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A CLOCK SPRING THAT FED POWER TO THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH THAT PROVIDED POWER TO ACTIVATE THE HORN AND ALL THE OTHER CONTROLS THAT ARE NOT WORKING ON THE STEERING WHEEL. AND BY THE WAY, THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT COVER ANY OF THE COSTS OF THIS SAFETY REPAIR. THIS SOUNDED STRANGE TO ME. HOW COULD SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AND SIMPLE AS A HORN BE SO COMPLEX AND CONVOLUTED? WHY WOULD AN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER DESIGN SUCH A SIMPLE AND IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVEN THEIR OWN TECHNICIANS CANNOT ACCURATELY DETERMINE A DIAGNOSIS ON THEIR INITIAL IN-DEPTH EVALUATION?",
