APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER I WAS TRAVELING AT 50 MPH ON A STATE HIGHWAY AND THE LEFT REAR TIRE BLEW. IT JUST DID NOT GO FLAT, BUT BLEW. I RECALL THAT THERE WERE NO OBJECTS ON THE HIGHWAY THAT CAUSED THIS. THE TIRE WAS CHANGED AND I OBSERVED THAT THE TIRE LOOKED DEFECTIVE. THERE WERE NO EXTRERNAL MARKINGS OR PUNCTURES TO INDICATE A PROBLEM. I BROUGHT THIS TIRE TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER IN LAFAYETTE,LA ON JOHNSTON STREET AND HE SAID I RAN OVER SOMETHING, WHICH I KNEW I DID NOT. HE THOUGHT I HIT A CURB, WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THERE ARE NONE ON STATE HWY 82. HE THEN TELLS ME IT WAS PROBABLY LOW PRESSURE, WHICH I THEN INFORMED HIM IT WAS JUST CHECKED PRIOR TO STARTING MY TRIP. HE SAID HE WAS ALL OUT OF SUGGESTIONS. I SAID HOW ABOUT DEFECTIVE? TO WHICH HE REPLIED, PROBABLY NOT, THE TIRE IS LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD. HE AND I OBSERVED THE TIRE WHICH SHOWS THE SIDEWALL PHYSICALLY TORE / SEPARATED FROM THE TREAD WITHOUT ANY PUNCTURES OR MARKINGS. HE REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRE UNDER WARRANTY. I NO LONGER BUY FIRESTONE TIRES AND I AM NOW CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE TIRE.  *AK( DOT NUMBER:   TIRE SIZE: P265R15 )",
