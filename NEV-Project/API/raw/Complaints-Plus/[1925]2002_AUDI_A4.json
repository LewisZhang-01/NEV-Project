SHORTLY THEREAFTER WHILE DRIVING THE CAR 20 MPH DOWN THE STREET OF DRACUT, MA THE REAR DRIVER'S-SIDE REAR WHEEL FELL OFF. THE DRACUT POLICE RESPONDED AND DOCUMENTED THE INCIDENT.

THE WHEEL WAS RE-ATTACHED BY THE SELLER (OR HIS MECHANIC). A FEW DAYS LATER THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT CAME BACK ON SINCE THE AFTER-MARKET CONVERTER FAILED AND THE CAR COULD NOT PASS INSPECTION. ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE ENGINE SPLASHGUARD FELL OFF THE CAR OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE SELLER. I LEFT THE CAR THERE. THE SPLASHGUARD WAS RE-ATTACHED BY THE SELLER OR HIS MECHANIC (WITH PLASTIC TIES, SINCE HE CLAIMED HE DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS ... EVEN THOUGH HE HAD MY CAR FOR OVER 24 HRS!).

I QUESTION IF THESE ARE \"ISOLATED\" INCIDENTS, AND IF THIS IS AN ONGOING PATTERN OF DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR PRACTICES WHICH ARE PLACING THE CITIZENRY HEALTH AND SAFETY AT RISK? I SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE SELLER AND DEMANDED A REFUND UNDER THE MA LEMON LAW WARRANTY. I WAS REFUNDED MY PURCHASE PRICE.

I CALLED THE DEALER IN ROCKVILLE AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A COIL FAILURE.  I HAD JUST HAD A COIL REPLACED IN FEBRUARY, WHEN A SIMILAR TYPE THING HAPPENED ON CONNECTICUT AVE. DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.  THAT TIME I WAS ABLE TO COAST INTO A GAS STATION.  THE CAR DIED WITH NO PREVIOUS WARNING.  ALL FOUR COILS HAVE BEEN REPLACED (4 CYLINDER) WITH NO REIMBURSEMENT FROM AUDI BECAUSE THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. I ASKED THE DEALER WHETHER THIS WAS ONE OF THE RECALL ITEMS THAT AUDI PUT NOTICE OUT ON AND THEY SAID NO. NOW THAT I READ THAT OTHERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR A4S IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE SYSTEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY AUDI.  AFTER ALL, MY DEALER TOLD ME THAT AUDI CHANGED THE COIL SYSTEM ON THE NEWER MODELS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  *TR",

IN AUGUST I REPORTED THE CAR RUNNING ROUGH AND WANTED THE COILS CHECKED, DEALER STATED THAT WITHOUT A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR HARD FAILURE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. TODAY IS THE SECOND FAILURE IN 5 MONTHS AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE CAR A FULL YEAR YET. THESE FAILURES ARE A SAFETY HAZARD, I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE CLOSE TO HOME AND DRIVING AT A SLOW SPEED WHEN EACH OCCURRED. DURING TODAY'S FAILURE THE CAR COULD BARELY GO 10MPH TO GET ME HOME. THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE AUDI 2002 1.8T.  DT",

THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DATE ABOUT THE TIRES PREMATURELY WEARING.  AT ABOUT 12600 MI THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR INDICATED A SUDDEN DECREASE IN PRESSURE FOR THE RR TIRE.  I WAS GOING ABOUT 15 MPH AND WAS NEAR A TIRE SHOP.   WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SHOP, THE TIRE WAS NEARLY FLAT.

THE LF WOULD PASS BUT IS BADLY FEATHERED FOR ONLY 12600 MILES.  THE CAUSE OF THE FLAT TIRE WAS A NAIL I HAD PICKED UP IN THE NEARLY BALD RR TIRE.  THE SHOP SAID IF IT HAD HAPPENED AT FREEWAY SPEEDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS.  THEY STATED A NORMALLY TREADED TIRE WOULD NOT HAVE PICKED UP THE NAIL, BUT BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE WEAR, THE NAIL IMMEDIATLELY PUNCTURED THE TIRE.  THE FACTORY REP TOLD ME THAT AUDI HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE GOODYEAR TIRE DESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR THE ALLROAD MODEL AND THEY HAD NOT SEE MUCH PROBLEM WITH THE PIRELLI TIRES FOR THE SAME MODEL.
