IN MY CASE THE ABS PUMP IS STUCK IN THE \"DUMP\" MODE WHICK FESULTS IN ALL PRESSURE BEING LOST TO THE REAF BRAKES. THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE LOCAL GMC DEALER, RIVERSIDE MOTORS, INDICATED THAT THERE IS PRESSURE TO THE REAR BRAKES AND THAT THE ABS IS JUST DISSABLED.  WITH NEW REAR SHOES PROPERLY INSTALLED AND ADJUSTED THE REAR WHELLS WILL SPIN FREELY WITH THE BRAKES APPLIED.  THE ABS WARNING LIGHT IS LIT AS WELL AS THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT.  THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT INDICATES THAT THIER IS A LOSS OF PRESSURE IN THE SYSTEM THUS CAUSING AN IMBALANCE.  A NEW MASTER CYLINDER DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE BRAKE FLUID IS BY-PASSING INSIDE THE ABS PUMP/VALVE ASSY. IR THIS OCCURRED IN A PANIC SITUATION MY BRAKING DISTANCE WOULD BE GREATLY INCREASE.   PROBLEM 2, STEERING, THE STEERING COLUMN BROKE OFF AT THE TOP  RIGHT WHERE THE TILT ADAPTER MOUNTED TO THE COLUMN.  THE COLUMN HAS SEVERAL LOCATING NOTCHES CUT IN IT WITH SHARP CORNERS. IT LOOKED LIKE A CRACK STARTED AT A SHARP EDGE AND WORKED ITS WAY AROUND.
