The contact stated while her mother attempted to park, the brake pedal was depressed and the vehicle violently accelerated on its own without warning. As a result, the contact crashed into a satellite pole. The air bags did not deploy. There were no injuries reported. A police report was not filed. The driver was able to reverse the vehicle and park into the parking spot, however the contact stated the failure reoccurred sporadically several times after the crash. The driver took the vehicle to a local dealer to have the vehicle inspected, however the dealer was not able to duplicate the failure. A few months later and the failure reoccurred again and the driver took the vehicle back to the dealer where the dealer repaired and replaced the throttle body control module on the vehicle, but the failure persisted after the repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.",

When i went to have them replaced at a discounted price, i could not because i had to put a spare tire on (it is considerably smaller) causing the tread on one tire to be slightly uneven from the others. so this voided the warranty. Now tell me how passenger side and driver side front tires both end up with sidewall bubbles and one blows out within a week apart? Nothing changed in my driving routine. Bought two nearly new tires to maintain my ability to get around, and a third tire develops a bubble and had to be replaced. The last tire is slowly leaking!? i drive to work and back. I live less than 2 mins from my place of employment. i do still have my paperwork from buying the tires. btw the warranty was never registered correctly because when i tried to call about it they had no idea where to find it. i had to send all sorts of paperwork to them and still got no results.",

AFTER INCONCLUSIVE DIAGNOSTICS BY THE REPAIR SHOP AND MY RESEARCH ON THIS WEBSITE, WE HAD TO ASSUME IT WAS SIMILAR TO TOO MANY OTHER IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS. MY DAUGHTER DRIVES THIS CAR TO AND FROM COLLEGE, EACH ONE WAY TRIP BEING ABOUT 180 MILES. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE COULD \"HOPE\" WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS TO NOT HAVE IT REPAIRED. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE THROTTLE BODY AT OUR OWN EXPENSE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT $800. WE WILL NEVER SPEND ANOTHER DIME ON A FORD PRODUCT. WE BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW SO OUR DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE A SAFE CAR. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY. I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HOW A PROBLEM LIKE THIS, WHICH SOUNDS MUCH TO COMMON, CAN BE IGNORED. FORD SHOULD BE FORCED TO ISSUE A RECALL, AS WELL AS REIMBURSE ALL THE CAR OWNERS THAT HAVE PAID OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS TO HAVE THIS FIXED.

SOMETIME IN 2012 (I ESTIMATE AROUND 12/13/12), I PURCHASED A NEW SET OF TIRES (APPROXIMATELY $600) AS I NOTICED THE CAR SLIDING AT STOPS AND SKIPPING ON ACCELERATION.  I HAD THE CAR IN A FORD DEALERSHIP (JIM KEIM FORD, HILLIARD, OH) AND WAS SHOWN THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE CAR AND HOW THE TIRES WERE WEARING UNEVENLY, WEARING ON THE INSIDE.   INTO THE NEXT YEAR, I AGAIN STARTED NOTICING THE UNUSUAL WEAR PATTERN AND HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER SET OF TIRES ON 6/27/14 AT 56,000 MILES, $625.  ON 6/24/14 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THE SWAY BAR LINKS REPLACED, $271.  I CANNOT FIND THE RECEIPT FOR THE FIRST TIRE PURCHASE, BUT BOB SUMEREL TIRES (614)237-6325 WOULD HAVE PURCHASE RECORD OF BOTH TIRE SETS.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 58,000 MILES ON IT NOW AND FOR IT TO BE ON ITS THIRD SET OF TIRES DEFINITELY SAYS EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR.  THIS IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING WITH THESE TIRES WEARING AND IS A CONSTANT WORRY WITH ALL THE CHECKING I DO TO MAKE SURE THE TIRES ARE OK TO DRIVE ON.  I WOULD LIKE THIS MONEY REFUNDED (APPROXIMATELY $1500).  I HAVE RECEIPTS FOR THE SECOND SET OF TIRES AND THE SWAY BAR LINKS IF YOU NEED TO SEE THEM.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

ALSO, UPON MOVEMENT, TIRE NOISE INSIDE THE VEHICLE IS UNACCEPTABLE, AND THIS NOISE SOUNDS LOUDEST FROM THE INSIDE, FRONT LEFT OF THE VEHICLE (DRIVER'S SIDE).  AT 25 MPH, INSIDE TIRE NOISE IS 45 DB.  AT 55 MPH, INSIDE TIRE NOISE IS 85 DB.  RADIO IS OFF: WINDOWS ARE CLOSED.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  DEALER SAYS THAT IT IS NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE, AND THAT I SHOULD ALIGN THE CAR WITH EVERY OIL CHANGE, AT 3000 MILES: THIS IS NOT WHAT THE OWNER'S MANUAL RECOMMENDS.  ALIGNMENT SHOP SAYS THAT ALIGNMENT IS WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS, AND PROVIDES A PRINT-OUT SHOWING THE READINGS.  VEHICLE TRACKS STRAIGHT AND TURNS APPROPRIATELY.  I WILL WEAR OUT THE TWO LEFT TIRES BEFORE 30,000 MILES, WHILE THE RIGHT SIDE TIRES SHOW LITTLE WEAR FOR THE MILEAGE.  *TR",

I WAS DRIVING UP THE ROAD AND MY VEHICLE LOST ITS POWER COMPLETLY AND THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON. THE 3 THINGS I HAVE FOUND COMMON WHEN THIS HAPPENS IS THAT MY RPMS ARE AT 1.5 TRYING TO PUSH TO 2...THE MPH IS ABOUT 45 TO 50 AND I HAD JUST FILLED UP WITH GAS A FEW DAYS  PRIOR AND WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 3/4 TANK FULL. I PULL IT OVER TO PARK AND IT SHAKES VIOLENTLY. I HAVE NO POWER IN THE GAS PEDAL. I  TURN THE CAR OFF FOR A MINUTE THEN TRY TO START IT UP AGAIN AND IT TAKES A BIT FOR IT TO TURN OVER. THEN ITS RUNNING FINE..THAT IS UNTILL IT DOES IT AGAIN. THIS WEEK WILL BE THE 3RD TIME THE DEALER HAS MY CAR TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG. THEY CONTINUE TO TELL ME NOTHING.G IS WRONG AND THEY ARENT PICKING UP ANY CODES. I ASKED THEM IF THEY LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND THEY SD YES.  THEY HAVE GONE TO FORD THIS TIME TO FIND SOME KIND OF ANSWER. THIS CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 20K MILES ON.IT. I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW.  IT IS UNDER FULL WARRANTY THANK GOODNESS OTHERWISE I WOULD BE SCREWED.  *TT",
