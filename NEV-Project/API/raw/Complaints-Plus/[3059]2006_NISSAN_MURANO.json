I checked with my mechanic of 23 years and he found that there was no issue with the fuse or the horn itself - the horn activates when manually triggered. However, there is a problem with the relay from the steering column to the horn and with this Nissan model, that relay is integrated with the air bag in the steering column. It's possible that there's also an issue with the airbag but it's never had reason to deploy. Lodging this incident because the horn is a central part of any car safety system and there seems to be a manufacturer defect in the relay that is integrated into the steering column to trigger the horn.",

I tried to drive it further and the rear tires would not turn. After going a block, we parked it and got a ride home. The next day, we had it towed to the local Nissan Dealership. They inspected it and told us that the rear subframe had given out, due to rust. Thankfully, we were not going fast, as this situation made the whole rear suspension disconnected from the vehicle. I have called Nissan Customer Affairs, and they just quote what the warranty is on the vehicle. They say they can do absolutely nothing for us. Many Nissan Forums have multiple customers posting a similar problem. Who buys a car, and the frame just gives out? I am extremely disappointed with Nissan's lack of responsibility and customer service. I'd like them to offer some resolution. Ironically, we also own a '13 Nissan Murano. I am very concerned that the same thing could happen to this vehicle in the next few years. If that's the case, I'm going to sell it in a year or two. Please help us out NHTSA.

I PUT HOURS OF RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND MY VEHICLE IS NOT ALONE IN THIS. [HTTP://WWW.CARPROBLEMZOO.COM/NISSAN/MURANO/FRAME-RUST-PROBLEMS.PHP]  THIS LINK SHOWS JUST A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLAINED OF A SIMILAR ISSUE. MY ARGUMENT IS THAT NISSAN SHOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED THESE SUBFRAMES BECAUSE A 12-13 YEAR OLD CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE A BACK END DROP OUT OF IT BECAUSE OF SALT. I LIVE IN OHIO AND WE GET ABOUT 1-3 MONTHS OF SNOW AND OUR CITIES SALT A MODERATE AMOUNT. OTHER VEHICLE WE OWN/HAD (2001 FORD, 2002 FORD, 2005 FORD) HAVE RUST FROM THE SNOW BUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE VEHICLES ARE INTACT AND SAFE TO DRIVE. HOWEVER, THE NISSAN SUBFRAMES IN THESE MURANO'S ARE FAILING AND ENDANGER DRIVERS AROUND THE VICTIM'S CAR. PERSONALLY, I CAN HANDLE A CAR THAT LOSES CONTROL EVEN WHEN CARS ARE NEXT TO ME, BUT THIS STILL PUTS MYSELF AND VEHICLES AROUND ME IN DANGER. JUST RECENTLY MY CAR WAS DRIVING FINE AND WITH NO ICE ON THE ROAD (9:00PM ON A 47 DEGREE RAINY DAY) MY VEHICLE WOBBLES FROM THE BACK END AND VEERS RIGHT WHILE I AM ON HE HIGHWAY. I ADVISE THAT NISSAN TAKE ACTION AND RECALL THE 2006 NISSAN MURANO BECAUSE THEIR SUBFRAMES ARE NOT BUILT TO LAST NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR OF SNOW AND SALT THAT PEOPLE IN THE NORTH ARE SUBJECTED TO. I UNDERSTAND SALT IS CORROSIVE AND DETERIORATE THE CARS FASTER BUT THIS CAR IS A LUXURY CAR AND SHOULD BE BUILT TO LAST LONGER THAN MY 2002 FORD FOCUS HAS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   ALSO MAY I ADD THAT AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THIS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ALIGN THE CAR AND STATED THAT THE 'RUSTED OUT' SUBFRAME WILL BREAK IF HE ATTEMPTS TO FREE THE PARTS NEEDED TO ALIGN THE REAR OF THE CAR.

ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF CAR ON A VERY HIGH ELEVATED FREEWAY TURN AS WHEN I TURNED TO THE LEFT, THE SEAT ABRUPTLY CAME UP TURNING MY BODY TO THE RIGHT - THAT MOVEMENT MADE ME THEN SUDDENLY PULL DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL, WHICH THEN FORCED THE CAR TO SUDDENLY SWERVE TO THE LEFT.

THE CAR IS NOW VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AS YOU HAVE TO TRY AND BALANCE YOURSELF USING YOUR LEFT LEG/FOOT PULLED UP TO SEAT.  WHEN CORNERING YOU HAVE TO PUT SO MUCH ATTENTION ON TRYING NOT TO SWERVE AS THE SEAT RISES & DROPS YOU DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOU ARE TURNING.

THE CHAIR ISN'T 'A LITTLE LOOSE'-IT COMES COMPLETELY OFF THE FLOOR ON THAT SIDE.

I WAS ABLE TO STAY IN MY LANE, BUT HAD I TAKEN THE TURN FASTER AND NOT BEEN AWARE THAT MY SEAT MIGHT SHIFT, IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AND I WOULD HAVE ENDED UP IN THE CIVIC NEXT TO ME. I WENT ONLINE AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, TOO MANY OF WHICH DETAIL HOW THE SEAT BROKE WHILE THE DRIVER WAS TAKING A TURN OR COMING TO A STOP, AND CAUSED THE DRIVER TO SWERVE INTO ON-COMING TRAFFIC, JERK THE CAR ONTO A SIDEWALK NEARLY HITTING PEDESTRIANS, OR CAUSED THEM TO DROP BACK SO HARD THEY SLAM THEIR SHOULDER AND HEAD INTO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR (PLEASE SEE WWW.ABOUTAUTOMOBILE.COM/COMPLAINT/2005/NISSAN/MURANO/SEAT TO SEE JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN DANGEROUS DRIVING SITUATIONS BECAUSE OF THIS BRACKET DEFECT).

NISSAN HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE REPAIR CITING IT NOT BEING THE SAFETY HAZARD AND THAT THE VEHICLE'S WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  THIS IS A PART THAT SHOULD NEVER BREAK ON A VEHICLE, LET ALONE A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD.  I AM SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE SEAT TO MAINTAIN ITS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  DUE TO THE SAFETY CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH THIS SEAT AND WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN IN AN ACCIDENT, I WILL BE SELLING IT WHEN I HAVE IT PAID FOR IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS AND WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE.  NISSAN'S HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE HAS COST THEM MY FUTURE BUSINESS.  I DID SOME INTERNET RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE WHICH LED ME TO THIS SITE AS WELL AS UNCOVERED A HOST OF THE VERY SAME ISSUE WITH OTHER MURANOS.  IT APPEARS TO BE A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM WITH MURANOS OF THIS VINTAGE.  NISSAN DOES NOT AGREE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN.

UPON TAKING VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP SERVICE AGENT ADVISED HE HAS NOT SEEN THIS ISSUE IN THE 2 YEARS HE'S BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP AND ADVISED THERE IS NO RECALL OR KNOWN TSB.  SERVICE ORDER INDICATED A CODE OF B1054 WHICH MEANS 'DRIVERS SIDE AIR BAG OPEN'.  THUS, THEY RECOMMENDED 'REPLACE SPIRAL CABLE' FOR A TOTAL COST OF $371.88.  I PAID $69.95 DIAGNOSTIC FEE, $197 SPIRAL CABLE, AND $18.69 TAX AND PENDING PAYMENT OF $104.93 LABOR COST TO REPLACE PART.  UPON RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE ON THE WEB THE FOLLOWING WAS UNCOVERED: SEVERAL MURANO OWNERS, CROSSING MODEL YEARS, HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE AND TWO SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS.  THE FIRST SOLUTION STATES TO PERFORM A RESET BY TURNING THE VEHICLE FROM 'OFF' TO 'ON' THREE TIMES WHILE COUNTING TO 5 DURING THE 'OFF' TIME.  THIS SOLUTION WORKED FOR SEVERAL OWNERS.  THE SECOND SOLUTION IDENTIFIED BY ONE OWNER SAID REPLACEMENT OF THE 'SEAT BELT PRE TENSIONER', WHICH WAS SUPPOSEDLY COVERED UNDER A RECALL FOR A 2005 MURANO, SOLVED THE IDENTIFIED ISSUE.  WE CHOOSE TO PERFORM A SELF 'RESET' ON 12/13/2010 WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENT TO DEALERSHIP ANALYSIS PAYMENT OF $266.95 (DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND SPECIAL PART ORDER).  UPON DISCUSSING THE 'RESET' WITH NISSAN SERVICE AGENT, HE SUGGESTED EITHER RETURN SPECIAL ORDER PART AND PAY RESTOCKING FEE OR KEEP THE PART SINCE HE BELIEVES THE LIGHT WILL BEGIN FLASHING AGAIN.

OUR VEHICLE WAS ACTUALLY IN AN ACCIDENT PRIOR TO THE FAILURE AND INITIALLY WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE ACCIDENT. HOWEVER THE LOCAL NISSAN SHOP GURU INDICATES THAT IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT. THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS PURCHASED OF COURSE DOES NOT COVER THIS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PICTURE OF THE SEAT ON THE BROCHURE. LIKE OTHERS HAVE BEEN TOLD $1000+ TO REPAIR. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE NHTSA WOULD RE-OPEN THEIR INVESTIGATION AS IT WAS CLOSED ON 7/2/09 AND IT APPEARS THIS ISSUE TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS TO MANIFEST. OUT OF THE 108 COMPLAINTS REGISTERED 23 WERE PRIOR TO THE DATE THE INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED 11/18/08, SO 85 WERE AFTER THAT OR MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. MY HOPE IS THAT THEY RE-OPEN THE INVESTIGATION DUE TO ONGOING COMPLAINTS RELATING TO AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. WHY DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE OR BE SERIOUSLY INJURED BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE. ISN'T THE OBJECTIVE TO IDENTIFY AN ISSUE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE AND HAVE THE MANUFACTURER FIX THE PROBLEM. CLEARLY NISSAN IS NOT MOTIVATED DESPITE THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS. IS THAT BECAUSE THEY SOLD OVER 500,000 1ST GENERATION MURANOS(IT IS NOT JUST THE 2006 MODEL THAT HAS THESE ISSUES). SO IF IT IS $1,000 PER REPAIR ON A RECALL AT 500,000 UNITS THE TOTAL PRICE TAG IS 500 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS FIX. WELL NO WONDER WHY THIS HAS YET TO BE RECALLED.

AS WE WERE GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE MY GRANDMOTHER STATED SHE FELT HEAT ON THE AREA OF THE ARMREST.  I CAME INSIDE FOR NO MORE THAN 5 MINS AND WHEN I CAME BACK OUT THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE WAS ON FIRE BETWEEN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEATS I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911 AS A RESULT OF THIS FIRE THE VEH WAS A TOTAL LOSS.  I HAVE PICS OF THE AFTERMATH SHOWING THAT THE TRUNK HATCH MELTED AND THAT THE INTERIOR WAS NOTHING BUT THE FRAME.  UP UNTIL 5/29/10 THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG WHEN THERE IS A MAINTENANCE ISSUE A GREEN WRENCH POPS UP ON THE DASHBOARD SCREEN AND THE ONLY TIME THAT POPPED UP WAS WHEN THE TIRE ROTATION MAINTENANCE WAS DUE.  THE ONLY MAINTENANCE THAT I HAVE HAD DONE ON THE VEHICLE SINCE PURCHASING ON 11/07/10 WAS AN OIL CHANGE, THE OTHER SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WAS FOR 4/17/10 FOR A TIRE ROTATION WHICH WAS NOT DONE BECAUSE THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN PUT DOWN FOR AN OIL CHANGE WHICH WAS NOT NEEDED, I HAD SCHEDULED THIS APPT ONLINE AND IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED ONLINE WHAT I WAS COMING IN TO HAVE DONE.  THE MECHANIC DID AN OIL CHANGE AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM I WAS NOT DUE FOR AN OIL CHANGE HE TOLD ME THE 2 TIRES WOULD SOON NEED TO BE REPLACED ON THE VEHICLE THEREFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO ROTATE AN HE RESET THE MONITOR ON THE VEH.

THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AT THE END OF MARCH 2010. I SCHEDULED MY CAR TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE BEGINNING OF APRIL. PRIOR TO THE APPT, I NOTICED A MAJOR DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE 2 FUEL INSTRUMENT GAUGES. WHENEVER FUEL WOULD BE DOWN TO AROUND A QUARTER OF A TANK OF GAS, ONE OR BOTH OF THE GAUGES/ELECTRONIC DISPLAY WOULD SHOW ANY WHERE FROM 1/2 A TANK OF FUEL TO COMPLETELY EMPTY. AFTER BRINGING THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE IN APRIL, I WAS INFORMED THAT MY FACTORY WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT, AND THAT MY AFTER MARKET WARRANTY PURCHASED FROM THAT DEALERSHIP, DIDN'T COVER THE REPAIR NEEDED. I WAS ADVISED THAT MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND FUEL GAUGE/ELECTRONIC DISPLAY WAS DUE TO A DEFECTIVE 'FUEL SENDER'(FUEL LEVEL SENDING UNIT). I WAS TOLD THAT THE SENSOR(S) NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THAT WITH PARTS AND LABOR, THE ESTIMATED REPAIR COST WOULD BE $450. AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM MYSELF, I FOUND THAT NISSAN IS HAVING MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE IN OTHER MODELS THE SAME MODEL YEAR, 2006. I CONTACTED NISSAN AND FOUND THAT NO RECALLS ON THIS ISSUE ARE BEING TAKEN AT THIS TIME. I FEEL THAT GIVEN THE LARGE-SCALE RECALL (540,000 VEHICLES MOSTLY IN THE US) IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL OTHER MODELS, SAME YEAR, SAME PROBLEM, IT STANDS TO REASON THAT MY MODEL SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL. I HAVE NOT AS OF YET RUN OUT OF FUEL ON THE ROADWAY BUT THAT IS MAINLY DUE TO CONSTANTLY KEEPING THE TANK AT LEAST HALF FULL TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY. I HAVE NOT YET REPAIRED THE VEHICLE AT MY EXPENSE IN HOPES THAT THE NHTSA WILL MAKE NISSAN EXTEND ITS RECALL, AS IT SHOULD. *TR",

I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES WITH THE AIR INTAKE AND FIXING THE MOTOR MOUNTS DID NOT RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  AFTER THE AIR INTAKE RECALL  CAME OUT I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE THE PARTS REPLACED.  WHILE PICKING UP MY CAR I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT MY FRUSTRATION ON HAVING TO REPLACE THE MOTOR MOUNTS WHICH NEVER RESOLVED THE PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE AWARE THAT THE MOTOR MOUNTS ON THE MURANO WERE WEAK (NOT JUST MINE BUT ACROSS THE BOARD) AND THEY FELT THAT WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CARS IN MY LIFE AND HAVE PUT OVER 100,000 MILES ON SEVERAL OF THE CARS THAT I OWNED AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE THE MOTOR MOUNTS.  IF NISSAN KNOWS THAT THE MOTOR MOUNTS ARE WEAK ON THIS CAR THEN WHY HAS THAT PART NOT BEEN RECALLED?",

ANOTHER REASON IT WAS WELL-MAINTAINED. I HAVE 12 INCH RODS IN MY SPINE, AND DEPEND ON MY VEHICLE TO PROTECT ME.  YES, THE AIRBAGS, ETC. WORKED, BUT  I BELIEVE THE BRAKES FAILED, CAUSING THE WRECK.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. *TR",

THIS ALREADY HAPPENED TO ME OVER 3 TIMES AND NISSAN'S SERVICE DEPT NEVER RESOLVES THIS IMPORTANT PROBLEM.  THIS URGENT PROBLEM NEEDS TO TAKEN CARED OF ASAP OR ELSE IT WILL BE DANGEROUS FOR DRIVER AND PASSENGER'S LIFE. *TR",
