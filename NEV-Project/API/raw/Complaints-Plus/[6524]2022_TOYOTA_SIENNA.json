        "summary": "The car does not have DIGITAL REAR VIEW which uses built-in camera installed at bottom of back to display what is behind the car. Because of this whenever ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DISPLAY (DVD PLAYER) is pulled for use or CARGO is fully loaded; REAR VIEW MIRROR does not show anything and driver remains unaware what is coming behind the car or what is going on behind the car. I had incident in first couple of usage it self that I was not able to see emergency vehicle & was not able to give a way. Additionally, it could be difficult to understand behaviour of other cars behind coming. I have purchased this car paying lots of money and others could have do so thinking lots of safety features for family usage purpose. Unavailability of rear-view mirror display when there is obstructing entertainment system and cargo, will completly put all passengers at risk. I have paid more than MSRP for this car as I was in deep need of car. Dealer did not give any detail on this issue and when drove car multiple time then only experienced. Raised everything to TOYOTA by calling their number given in the car manual. No one picks up. Submitted online complaint (Reference#220311002236) but not getting any helpful response. They are just saying someone will call from nearest toyota dealership or reachout directly. When no call came, went to dealer who says reachout to TOYOTA directly! Its going in circle. Also reached out to DEALER from where it is purchased, they are too not responding. This is to be taken seriously. I am going thourgh lots of harrassment by dealer/toyota after paying this much for the car and should be compensated accordingly. NHTSA should help me getting DIGITAL REAR VIEW CAMERA installed in this vehicle and have TOYOTA to install same in all other similar configured TOYOTA SIENA vehicle. As an alert citizen and driver, I am raising this and can provide more details if needed but need all help to fix on this car. Rest everyting is fine in the car. Thanks.",

This caused the RCTA and BSW systems to fail because the sensors were obstructed by mud.  This failure condition happens to my 2022 Toyota Sienna every three weeks.  Toyota has designed the vehicle to allow the ingress of debris to the *interior* of the rear bumper, therefore the failure of RCTA and BSW is inevitable.  Toyota can and should know that this failure is inevitable but has offered no repair, nor has it offered advice on how to restore operability after failure.  Yes, mud can interfere with safety sensors on any vehicle, but only this 2022 Toyota Sienna intentionally allows mud to accumulate on the *interior* of the bumper resulting in this otherwise avoidable failure.",

        "summary": "Got my 2022 sienna with the factory installed rear entertainment system. When the entertainment system is in use, there is ZERO visibility out of the rear view mirror or window. This is a huge safety issue as I have almost been rear ended 4 times now. Today while it was snowing, if I had my entertainment system in use, I would not have been able to see that someone was sliding in to me. Luckily I saw out of my rear view mirror and I was able to hurry and speed up to not get hit. I have taken the car to 2 Toyota dealerships who have both verified and took pictures to show that you cannot see a thing out of the mirror or window when the entertainment is in use. They all agree it is a major safety issue and reported it to Toyota corporate and opened a case to get it fixed. The fix is to install a digital rear view mirror for those who have the entertainment system (which again comes from the factory)  Toyota brand engagement said that yes this is a safety issue but since there is no ope recall they won't fix it for me by giving me a digital rear view mirror. This is absolutely crazy that there is this big of a design/safety flaw over looked by Toyota. They also told me that there have been some that have been fixed however it is a case by case basis and basically depends on who you talk to.  I just paid 52,000 for this car and I can't use the features it comes with because of this huge safety issue.  If I had my back window taped up completely blacked out and couldn't see through it, I would get a ticket from the police for a safety hazard of not being able to see out of my back window. How is this different? This is unacceptable and should immediately be recalled for those vehicles that toyota put entertainment systems in. This issue could cause people to be rear ended because they cannot see anything out of their windows. I can send pictures that the dealership took to verify this safety issue.  It needs to be addressed and corrected before people get hurt.",
