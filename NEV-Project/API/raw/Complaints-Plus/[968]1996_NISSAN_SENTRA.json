I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC THE VERY NEXT MORNING AND THEY SAID IT WAS BROKEN, THAT A PLASTIC PIECE SNAPPED OFF.  IT WAS A DEALERSHIP ITEM, BUT THAT IT IS A NISSAN RECALL ITEM.

MEANWHILE, I HAVE TO GO TO WORK AND CAN'T DRIVE IN THE RAIN, SNOW, SLEET, HAIL.  WHEN I ASKED WHY THEY COULDN'T FEDEX THE PART THE DEALERSHIP IN LATHAM TOLD ME IT IS BECAUSE IT IS A BACK-ORDER ITEM.  I ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD LOAN ME A CAR DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS A RECALL ITEM.  THEY TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN PROMISED I WOULD HEAR FROM THEM THE SAME DAY IN A LITTLE WHILE, THEY HAD TO WAIT ON AN ANSWER FROM SOMEONE.  I NEVER HEARD BACK, SO I CALLED THEM.  THEY SAID THEY COULD GET ME A RENTAL CAR, BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR IT.  I WAS VERY UPSET BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, THIS DEFECT IS NOT MY DOING.  SECOND, I CAN END UP WITH NO JOB IF I CAN'T GET TO MY JOB.
