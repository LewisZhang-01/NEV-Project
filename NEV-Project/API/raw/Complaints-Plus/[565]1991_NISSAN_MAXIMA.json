AFTER DRIVING THE CAR BACK HOME (WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY) AND INVESTIGATING THE SEATBACK SUPPORT STRUCTURE, I FOUND THE METAL FRAME WAS SHEARED IN TWO AT THE LOWER LEFT PORTION OF THE SEATBACK.  THE NEXT DAY I USED A BOARD TO PROP THE SEAT UP TEMPORARILY, AND DROVE IT TO THE DEALER FROM WHOM I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN 1991.  THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE SEAT BACK METAL FRAME HAD BROKEN IN TWO PIECES DUE TO \"METAL FATIGUE\"  BUT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY DUE TO TIME AND MILEAGE.  I NOTIFIED NISSAN ON THEIR TOLL-FREE NUMBER; THEY ENTERED IN ALL MY INFORMATION, AND ALSO CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS NOT A COVERED ITEM.  THIS, IN MY OPINION, IS A SERIOUS SAFETY RELATED DEFECT WHICH HAS APPEARED ON AT LEAST 6 OTHER CARS FROM THIS YEAR'S MODEL, ACCORDING TO NHTSA RECORDS.

NISSAN HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY MODEL YEARS, AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY MAY HAVE OCCURRED THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED TO NHTSA.  SOME PEOPLE SUFFERED INJURIES DUE TO THIS SEAT FAILURE, AND THAT MAKES IT A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT THAT SHOULD REQUIRE MORE INVESTIGATION SINCE THE MANUFACTURER THINKS THIS IS WITHIN \"ACCEPTABLE LIMITS' CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF THESE CARS SOLD.
