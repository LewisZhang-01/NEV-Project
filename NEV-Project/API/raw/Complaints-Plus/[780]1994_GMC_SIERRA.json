I DESCRIBED THE SITUATION AND PROVIDED THE RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER (98V150001).  THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT IN THEIR COMPUTER.  THEY PUT ME ON HOLD AND CALLED HARCO TO SEE IF THEY HAD A HARD COPY OF THE RECALL.  HARCO DID NOT.  THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT HELP ME.  I OFFERED TO EMAIL THE NOTICE I FOUND ON THE INTERNET TO THE REPRESENTATIVE AT GM CUSTOMER SERVICE.  HE SAID \"WE DON'T HAVE EMAIL\" (UNBELIEVABLE, IT'S 2006).  I GAVE HIM A WEBSITE.  HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING GM CAN DO.  I ASKED \"DO YOU DENY I OWN THIS VEHICLE?\"  HE DID NOT DENY IT.  I ASKED \"DO YOU DENY THAT THIS RECALL EXISTS?\"  HE DID NOT DENY IT.

THE DEFECTIVE PIRELLI DESERT DOG TIRE WAS EXCHANGED AT SAM'S ABOUT 9/18 OR 19/98 BY SAM'S WITHOUT QUESTIONS AND IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE DEFECTIVE.  THE PIRELLI DESERT DOG TIRE ON MY PASSENGER REAR SIDE OF MY GMC PICKUP THAT HAD THE TREAD SEPARATE FROM THE TIRE ON HWY 90 AT 70 MPH MADE NOISE JUST LIKE THE OTHER DEFECTIVE TIRE JUST BEFORE IT SEPARATED.  THE TIRE TREAD SEPARATED FROM ABOUT HALF OF THE TIRE AND THE TIRE REMAINED INFLATED.  WHEN THE TREAD SEPARATED IT BEAT UP AND DAMAGED MY PASSENGER REAR FENDER, UNDER SIDE OF MY BED, MY BUMPER AND MY EXHAUST TAIL PIPE.  WHEN THE TIRE SEPARATED IT CAUSED MY TRUCK TO SWERVE RIGHT AND LEFT VIOLENTLY AND ALMOST CAUSED MY PICKUP TO FLIP OVER.  MY WIFE AND I WERE SERIOUSLY SHAKEN, STOPPED THE VEHICLE, CHECKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THANKED GOD WE WERE NOT INJURED OR KILLED.  THE TIRE WAS REPLACED WITH THE SPARE AND WE CONTINUED TO NEW ORLEANS, LA.  THE TRUCK HAD NOTHING IN THE BED BUT WE WERE TOWING A TRAILER WITH NOTHING IN OR ON IT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE TRAILER HELPED IN PREVENTING THE OVERTURNING OF MY PICKUP BY KEEPING THE REAR END OF MY PICKUP FROM SWERVING MORE VIOLENTLY THAN IT DID.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO SAM'S AND THEY INDICATED IT WAS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT, I CONTACTED PIRELLI, SENT THE TIRE WITH ESTIMATED DAMAGES BUT PIRELLI REPORTED THAT THE TIRE WAS NOT DEFECTIVE.  AFTER VIEWING THE FILM ON THE TIRES BEING INVESTIGATED BY CONGRESS, I FELT IT NECESSARY TO REPORT THE SITUATION THAT I HAVE HAD WITH THESE PIRELLI DESERT DOG TIRES.  MY VEHICLE REACTED EXACTLY LIKE THOSE ON THE VIDEO SEEN ON TV WHEN THE TREAD SEPARATED.  NEITHER SAM'S OR PIRELLI ARE WILLING TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE OR REPLACE MY TIRE SO I HAVE HAD TO GO TO MY OWN INSURANCE CARRIER TO GET MY VEHICLE REPAIRED.  PLEASE HELP IN REPORTING THIS SAFETY HAZARD.",

I DISASSEMBLE THE FAILED PART AND FOUND HEAVY ARC-DEPOSITS ON THE CONTACTS. LATER I WAS NOTIFIED BY GMC OF A RECALL CAMPAIGN ON THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. THE NOTIFICATION STATED THAT UNDER THIS RECALL THE DEALER WOULD REPLACE THE EXISTING SWITCH AND CHANGE THE POLARITY. AT 109536 MILES THE SWITCH WAS AGAIN REPLACED VIA THE RECALL (P/N 1250076  7164) AND I WAS REIMBURSED FOR THE EARLIER PURCHASE OF A REPLACEMENT SWITCH. AT 131925 MILES ANOTHER DRIVER INFORMED ME THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE NOT WORKING. I CONTACTED GMC (A LOCAL DEALER AND CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE) TO INFORM THEM THAT THE \"CORRECTIVE ACTION\" MADE DURING THEIR RECALL HAD NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM. THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE ONLY REQUIRED TO FIX IT ONCE AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE SWITCH AGAIN AT NO COST TO ME. I PURCHASED A NEW SWITCH (P/N 1250076 9074 XY), AND REPLACED THE FAILED SWITCH AT 132069 MILES. SINCE I ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEW SWITCH WILL EVENTUALLY CEASE TO FUNCTION TOO, I HAVE INSTALLED AN INTERIOR INDICATOR SO THAT I WILL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN (WITHOUT THE RISK OF A COLLISION). DISASSEMBLE OF THE RECENTLY FAILED SWITCH REVEALED THAT THE CONTACTS WERE CONTAMINATED WITH ARC-DEPOSITS AS IN THE CASE OF THE ORIGINAL SWITCH.
