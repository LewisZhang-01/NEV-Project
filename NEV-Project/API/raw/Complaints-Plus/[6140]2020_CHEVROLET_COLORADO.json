Fortunately I was already parked so I did not need exit the roadway. It had been a long hot day in the mid to upper 90s  I was about to take a brief nap in the vehicle and could have potentially died if I had fallen asleep as I was waiting in the parking lot on my partner to Complete a couple purchases and was anticipating about a 30 to 45 minute wait.

The exhaust fumes were bad enough that all windows had to be rolled down and needed to exit hhhighway  for the enext  exit to park and exit the vehicle as soon as possible.  Partner  notes  that they saw exhaust  smoke/fumes  coming  iin  from the  vents  with  the  air conditioner running .  3) The dealer has not been able to reproduce the problem.

The amount of exhaust fumes coming into the vechle was not a gradual ooccurrence but a sudden large amount of fumes.
