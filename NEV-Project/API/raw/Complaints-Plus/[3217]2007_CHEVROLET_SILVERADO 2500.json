I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY GM THAT NO REPAIR IS AVAILABLE AND THERE NO TIME FRAME TO OFFER. IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE I WAS TOLD IT COULD BE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OR YEARS AND SORRY THEY HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION? THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE PURCHASED AND PAID FOR THE TRUCK IN GOOD FAITH. THE TRUCK IS PARKED IN THE GARAGE BASED ON NHTSA AND GM RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONTINUING NEWS WARNINGS. THE TRUCK  IS NOW ALMOST 10 YEARS OLD, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TRADE OR SELL IT DO TO THE ISSUE AND ARE BASICALLY STUCK. THE VEHICLE HAS JUST OVER 30K MILES AND AT THIS POINT WE ONLY DRIVE IT IF WE HAVE TO. I FEEL IT IS UNFAIR TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WAIT LEAVING THE VEHICLE PARKED OR DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH. AT THIS POINT WOULD IT BE FAIR FOR YOUR OFFICE TO STEP IN AND REQUIRE GM TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH A NEW TRUCK IF THERE IS NO OPTIONS AVAILABLE? WHILE I LIKE THE TRUCK VERY MUCH I FEEL THIS IS UNREASONABLE AND UNFAIR AT BEST.",
