THERE WERE MANY ISSUES THAT WERE POSSIBLE I WAS CLEARLY UNAWARE OF. ONE BEING OF UTMOST SAFETY TO MYSELF AND OTHERS. MY HIGH PRESSURE OIL PUMP LOCATED INSIDE THE ENGINE OF MY 2003 FORD F-350 6.0 DIESEL FAILED.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE ENGINE STOPS. THE HIGH PRESSURE OIL PUMP PROVIDES NEEDED PRESSURE TO THE INJECTORS IN ORDER TO HAVE A RUNNING ENGINE. BEING PARKED AND THE HPOP FAILING IS ONE THING HOWEVER DRIVING 55MPH ON A 2 LANE HIGHWAY AGAINST ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON A TURN IS A VERY BAD SITUATION. I AM FORTUNATE THAT I AM STILL VERY STRONG AT THE AGE OF 54. MY HPOP FAILED GOING 55MPH ON A LONG LEFT HAND TURN. AS THE ENGINE SHUTS DOWN BY BRAKES ARE LIMITED TO A SMALL AMOUNT OF STORAGE AND THEN THEY FAIL. THE STEERING HOWEVER FAILS IMMEDIATELY. I WAS HEADING STRAIT HEAD ON I TO A TRACKTOR TRAILER RIG. IT TOOK EVERY OUNCE OF STRENGTH TO ATTEMPT TO STEER THIS VEHICLE OUT OF THE OTHER LAND AND BRAKE GETTING IT OFF THE ROAD ASAP. IF THE BIG RIG HAD NOT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO MISS ME, I WOULDNT BE SENDING THIS LETTER. I WONDER HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO STEER OUT OF A SITUATION OR HAVE TIME TO STOP AND WERE KILLED. THE REPORT MOST LIKELY SAID\" DRIVER FELL ASLEEP.\" OR SOMETHING TO THAT AFFECT. THERE IS NO WAY THIS ENGINE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OPERATION ON THE ROAD PERIOD. FORD SHOULD HONOR ALL CURRENT OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE WITH A VERY REASONABLE SETTLEMENT NOT TO MENTION HAVING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER. I KNOW OF NO OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THAT HAVE SUCH AN ISSUE. COMPLETE FAILURE OF STEERING AND BRAKES DUE TO AN UNFORESEEN INTERNAL MECHANICAL ISSUE IS A VERY POOR DESIGN.

THEY CAME WITH A 6 YEAR/50K MILE WARRANTY.  I HAD TIRES ROTATED PER WARRANTY.  ON 11 APRIL, 2019, I EXPERIENCED A DRIVERS REAR TIRE FAILURE ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE (WITH CRUISE CONTROL SET @ 77MPH) CAUSING MINOR DAMAGE.  CONTACTED DEALER WHO SAID \"ROAD HAZARD\" NOT COVERED.  CONTACTED BFG WHO REQUESTED TIRE REMAINS BE SENT FOR ANALYSIS (TO PROVE ROAD HAZARD).  ON 10 MAY DEPARTED FROM HOME TO GO TO VIRGINIA.  150 MILES UP I75 HAD TIRE VIBRATION AGAIN.  PULLED OVER IN TIFTON, GA AND CHECKED TIRE TIME WITH IR GUN.  ALL TIRES RUNNING BETWEEN 95-108 F.  FELT TIRES AND HAD A BULGE IN DRIVERS FRONT.  INSTALLED SPARE AND STARTED LOOKING FOR A BFG DEALER THAT HAD TWO TIRES IN INVENTORY (ONE TO INSTALL/ONE TO CARRY IN CASE OF FURTHER TROUBLE WITH SET). AS I APPROACHED MACON, GA, ANOTHER TIRE STARTED VIBRATING.  WITHIN 5 MILES - IT BLEW HARD AT THE DRIVERS REAR POSITION AGAIN CAUSING OVER $3200 DAMAGE.  CALLED EMERGENCY TIRE SERVICE AND REPLACED THE THREE REMAINING TIRES FROM THE 2014 SET.  NOTIFIED BFG AND THEY ONLY WANTED THE THIRD FAILURE (SECOND BLOW) FOR ANALYSIS.  CUSTOMER SERVICE REP STATED ALL TIRE BULGES ARE CAUSED BY \"ROAD HAZARDS\".  IN SUMMARY - I EXPERIENCED THREE FAILURES IN JUST OVER 800 MILES ON A SET OF TIRES THAT ONLY HAVE 17,000 MILES ON THEM (REMAINING TREAD IS 11/32 PER DEALER INSPECTION).  SINCE I STILL HAVE ALL OF THE TIRES - PHOTOS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  FIRST TIRE DID SHOW ONE SECTION 7 INCHES LONG WITH FOUR RADIAL SPLITS STARTING AT THE RIM.  SECOND TIRE HAS NUMEROUS RADIAL SPLITS BUT NONE ARE CLOSELY CLUSTERED.    IS MY EXPERIENCE UNIQUE TO MY SET OF CONDITIONS OR ARE THERE OTHER SIMILAR OCCURRENCES.
