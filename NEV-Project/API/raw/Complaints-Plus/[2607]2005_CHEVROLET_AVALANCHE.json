THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, BUT JUST ASKED IF I WAS TOWING SOMETHING AT THE TIME AND OTHER QUESTIONS TO WHICH THE ANSWER WAS NO. I TOOK MY AVALANCHE TO THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY TO GET IT CHECKED. ON THE 9TH, THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT 2ND AND 4TH GEARS WERE OUT. HE SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO TEAR INTO IT TO FIND OUT IF IT COULD BE REPAIRED. I ASKED HOW MUCH THAT WAS GOING TO BE AND HE SAID AROUND $580.00. I LET THEM TEAR INTO IT STARTING ON THE 10TH. DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ON THE 10TH OR 11TH BUT ON THE 12TH, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS \"PRETTY WELL COOKED\" AND IT WOULD NEED REPLACED WITH A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION FOR $3200.00. HE SAID THE REMANUFACTURED ONE WOULD COME WITH A 3YR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY. I CALLED BACK GM CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THEM TO CALL ME. BASED ON EVERYTHING I'VE READ ON THE INTERNET, IT APPEARS THAT THIS TRANSMISSION IS WELL KNOWN FOR FAILING AND I DON'T BELIEVE A 2005 AVALANCHE WITH ONLY 88,000 MILES ON SHOULD HAVE FAILED. I'VE USE MY VEHICLE FOR MOSTLY GOING TO AND FROM WORK AND ON LONG TRIPS. HOPEFULLY, GM WILL ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FAILED DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDE ME WITH A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TRANSMISSION IS REALLY NOT A \"TRUCK\" TRANSMISSION BUT IS ALSO USED IN SOME OF GM'S OTHER SEDANS WHICH WEIGH TWICE AS LESS AND ARE NOT USED FOR THE SAME TYPES OF THINGS A TRUCK IS MEANT FOR.

WHEN THE DEALER PULLED IT IN THE SHOP, THEY CONFIRMED OUR SUSPICION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.      THE ORIGINAL INSTALLED GAS LINES ON MY TRUCK WERE CROSSED FOR WHAT REASON IS UNKNOWN AND THEY RUBBED OVER TIME AND RUBBED A HOLE IN THEMSELVES.  THEY ARE A REINFORCED BRAIDED LINE.

THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP/BRAKE PROPERLY, THE TIRES WERE RUBBING INTO THE FRONT FENDERS AND THE FRONT END WANDERED AND PULLED TO THE LEFT. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THAT DAY AND SPOKE WITH THE SALESMAN. IT TOOK THE DEALERSHIP ALMOST THREE WEEKS TO GET MY VEHICLE INTO THEIR REPAIR FACILITY. THEY HAD ADDRESSED THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE, BUT THEY DID NOTHING TO FIX THE VEHICLE. I THEN RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP A WEEK LATER STATING MY CONCERNS TO THE SERVICE MANAGER. THE SERVICE MANAGER VERIFIED THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE. ON THIS VISIT NOTHING WAS FIXED AGAIN. A WEEK AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER CHEVY DEALERSHIP. THIS DEALERSHIP STATED AND VERIFIED THE VEHICLE DOES HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT THERE WAS NO FIX FOR IT. THIS DEALERSHIP ALSO STATED THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, AND STATED THE SELLING DEALERSHIP NEVER FIXED THE RECALL. AGAIN THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED FOR THE PROBLEMS, BUT THE RECALL WAS NOW COMPLETED BY THIS DEALERSHIP. I CALLED THE SELLING DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, THE SALES MANAGER, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER, THE SALESMAN AS WELL AS OTHERS TO TRY TO HAVE THE VEHICLE REPAIRED OR HAD THE PURCHASE VOIDED TO RECEIVE MY MONEY BACK. NO ONE IN THIS DEALERSHIP WILL HELP ME. I THEN CALLED GENERAL MOTORS (CORPORATE) AND FILED A COMPLAINT. THEY WILL NOT HELP ME. TODAY I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, AND NOW WITH YOUR AGENCY. I AM SEEKING HELP BECAUSE I FEEL THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE VEHICLE FOR MY FAMILY TO BE IN. *JB",
