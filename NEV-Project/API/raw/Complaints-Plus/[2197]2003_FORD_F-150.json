WHEN WATER IS INTRODUCED TO THESE MODULES, IT MAKES THE WHOLE SYSTEM GO WACKY AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

RUST-THROUGH ON THE ROOF COULD CAUSE THE METAL TO BREAK OFF AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND INJURE SOMEONE  3. DECREASED STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE ROOF COULD DECREASE SAFETY IN THE EVENT OF A ROLLOVER  4. RUST IN THE AREA ATTACHING THE WINDSHIELD COULD CAUSE THE WINDSHIELD TO FAIL OR FLY OFF  5. WATER LEAKING INTO THE ROOF CAUSED MOLD, WHICH IS A BREATHING HAZARD    THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN - THE CHANNELS COLLECTED WATER WITH NO WAY FOR IT TO DRAIN, SO THE WATER POOLED AND CAUSED RUST, BOTH IN THE ENDS OF THE CHANNELS AND ALONG THE RIM OF THE WINDSHIELDS.

THE FUEL TANK ON THE TRUCK HAD SIGNIFICANT RUST UNDER ONE OF THE STRAPS, RESULTING IN A LEAK IN THE AREA UNDER THE STRAP. WHEN I BROUGHT THE TRUCK IN FOR THE RECALL WORK I NOTIFIED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THE TANK WAS LEAKING UNDER THE STRAP. I WAS TOLD AS LONG AS THE TANK WAS LEAKING AS A RESULT OF THE STRAP FAILURE AND NOT LEAKING AT A SEAM OR ELSEWHERE ON THE TANK, FORD WOULD REPLACE THE TANK. I WAS LATER NOTIFIED THAT FORD DENIED THE TANK REPLACEMENT DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALREADY LEAKING. I WAS TOLD THAT IF THE RESULT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE REPAIR THEN FORD WOULD REPLACE THE TANK AT NO COST TO ME BUT SINCE IT WAS ALREADY LEAKING, THEY WOULDN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TANK REPAIR, ONLY THE REPLACEMENT OF THE STRAPS. AS A RESULT, I REPLACED THE TANK AT MY OWN EXPENSE.     THE FUEL TANK THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THIS TRUCK WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RUST UNDER THE FUEL TANK STRAP. THERE WAS NO LEAKAGE AT ANY OF THE SEAMS OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE TANK. THE FAILURE OF THE TANK, IN MY OPINION, IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CORROSION OF THE STRAPS. FORD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AS A PROBLEM BUT WILL ONLY REPAIR TANKS (AT THEIR EXPENSE) THAT BEGIN LEAKING DURING THE COURSE OF THE REPAIR. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE THAT FORD IS AWARE OF AND THEREFORE THE CURRENT RECALL FOR FUEL TANK STRAPS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE INSPECTION OF TANKS AND THE FREE REPLACEMENT OF ANY TANK SHOWING CORROSION IN THE VICINITY OF THE FAILED STRAPS.  *TR",

APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS AGO THE ABS BRAKE LIGHT ON THE DASH CAME ON AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT STAYED ON.  THIS TIME I ALSO NOTED THAT AFTER I TURNED THE IGNITION SWITCH OFF I COULD STILL HEAR WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SOUND OF SMALL ELECTRIC MOTOR CONTINUOUSLY RUNNING UNDER THE HOOD.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND DETERMINED THE NOISE WAS ORIGINATING FROM THE ABS BRAKE CONTROL MODULE.  I FELT THE MODULE AND IT WAS WARM.  I PHONED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT SOMETIMES IF THE BATTERY IS DISCONNECTED THE MODULE WILL RESET ITSELF.  I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY FOR A MOMENT THEN RECONNECTED IT AND THE ABS BRAKE MODULE LIGHT ON THE DASH WENT OFF SO I ASSUMED IT HAD RESET ITSELF AND WAS NOW OK.  I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK FOR APPROX 1 1/2 WEEKS WITH NO TROUBLE THEN SUDDENLY THE ABS LIGHT ON THE DASH AGAIN CAME ON.  AS BEFORE WHEN I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE THE NOISE UNDER THE HOOD OF A SMALL ELECTRIC MOTOR RUNNING WAS AGAIN HEARD.  THE ABS CONTROL MODULE WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH AND A HOT SMELL WAS NOTED ALSO.  I VISITED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THE ABS CONTROL MODULE NEEDED REPLACED AT A PRICE OF SOMEWHERE AROUND $700.00 UP TO POSSIBLY $1200.00 SINCE WHEN THE ABS CONTROL MODULE GOES BAD THEN THE HYDRAULIC PORTION OF THIS SYSTEM IS LIKELY ALSO BAD.  THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 68500 MILES, LOOKS LIKE NEW,  AND HAS BEEN TREATED EXTREMELY GENTLY SINCE I PURCHASED IT NEW IN 2003.  *TR",

A FRIEND IS A MECHANIC WHO USED A SNAP-ON SOLUS DIAGNOSTIC TOOL WHICH SHOWS THE ABS DHCU SEES THE CAR MOVING AT 3-4 MPH WHILE PARKED, THE SYSTEM OFF, BUT WHEN YOU DRIVE THE CAR IT APPLIES THE ABS SYSTEM WHILE SLOWING BELOW ABOUT 5MPH UNDER NORMAL DRIVING (LIKE APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT) INCREASING THE STOPPING DISTANCE CONSIDERABLY. THE MODULE DOES NOT RESPOND TO RESET ATTEMPTS, AND REPAIR IS BY REPLACEMENT ONLY.   THE CAR IS A SPECIAL PRODUCTION FORD F150 LIGHTNING, WITH A DHCU SPECIFIC TO THE LIGHTNING EDITION.  REPLACEMENT OF THE MODULE IS ABOUT $700 PLUS LABOR.  THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 16,000 MILES ON IT, ABOUT 15,500 WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. *TR",

SERVICE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THAT THE CLUSTER ($700.00) WAS BAD AND REPLACED IT.  (WE HAVE SINCE BEEN TOLD BY OTHER MECHANICS, IF THE CLUSTER WAS BAD WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO START THE TRUCK, SO WHY WAS IT REPLACED.)   THE TRUCK WAS BROUGHT BACK HOME AND THE NEXT TIME IT RAINED THE BATTERY WAS AGAIN DEAD.  AGAIN TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.

TRUCK WAS AGAIN TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE IT REMAINED ANOTHER 2 WEEKS.  AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS AND COMPLAINTS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND NEEDED TO CALL THE MAIN TECHNICIANS.

NEXT MORNING I TOOK THE TRUCK TO HOLDER FORD IN LAKEPORT, CALIFORNIA AND THEY SAID I HAD BLOWN OUT THE REAR PLUG ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE ENGINE. THEY REPAIRED IT FOR $715.00 AND I GOT IT BACK ON MONDAY 10/6/08. AGAIN ON 10/11/08 SATURDAY THE SAME PLUG BLEW OUT. THIS TIME I WAS IN THE FAST LANE OF THE FREEWAY IN SAN RAFAEL HEADING FOR SAN FRANCISCO. THE TRUCK LOST POWER AND EVERY TIME I BACKED OFF THE GAS THE ENGINE DIED. I FOUGHT WITH THE TRUCK TO GET IT STARTED AND KEEP IT RUNNING TO GET IT  ACROSS THREE LANES OF BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC TO AN OFF RAMP. WHEN I STOPPED AND RAISED THE HOOD I SAW IT WAS THE SAME PLUG THAT WAS JUST REPAIRED. I CALLED HOLDER FORD AND THEY SAID SERVICE WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME UNTIL MONDAY. I DROVE THE CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALER ONLY TO FIND THE FORD DEALER HAD GONE OUT OF BUSINESS THERE SO I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND RENTED A CAR. I WAS 150 MILES FROM HOLDER FORD AND MY TOWING WOULD ONLY ALLOW 100 MILES. BESIDES THIS BLOWN SPARK PLUG ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT IT COST ME $400.00 FOR THE TOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FOR A RENTAL CAR. NOW I FIND OUT THERE ARE ONLY THREE THREADS IN THE HEAD TO HOLD THE PLUGS IN, AND THE HEADS ARE ALUMINUM. THE TRUCK IS A 2003 FORD F150 LIGHTNING 5.4 TRITON V8 WITH 70,000 MILES.  *TR",

AFTER CONTACTING THE DEALERSHIP AND TELLING THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND ASKING THEM IF THEY WOULD COVER THE PART SINCE IT HAD FAILED PREMATURELY, AND THEY ANSWERED \"NO\".  I TOOK IT TO A PRIVATE SHOP AND HAD THE SLAVE CYLINDER REPLACED.  THE DAY AFTER I GOT IT BACK I PERIODICALLY HEARD STRANGE NOISES COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION.  I TOOK IT BACK INTO THE SHOP THAT REPLACED MY SLAVE CYLINDER.  UPON OBSERVATION THEY FOUND NOTHING.  AFTER DRIVING IT FOR TWO MORE DAYS THE PROBLEM WAS EXTREMELY EVIDENT BY THE NOISES THAT WERE CONSTANT WHENEVER I SHIFTED AS WELL AS IN NEUTRAL.  I TOOK IT TO A REPUTABLE TRANSMISSION SHOP AND TOLD THE SHOP THAT I WANTED TO BE THERE WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS OPENED UP.  I WAS PRESENT WHEN THEY OPENED UP THE TRANSMISSION.  AS THEY PULLED THE TRANSMISSION APART, THEY FOUND MANGLED THIN METAL DEBRIS, SOME PIECES AS LARGE AS MY THUMBNAIL.  AFTER TAKING THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION APART AND INSPECTING ALL BEARINGS AND ALL OTHER PARTS, THEY FOUND THAT THE PIECES WERE A FOREIGN MATERIAL TO THE TRANSMISSION.  THEY DID NOT COME FROM ANY PART OF THE TRANSMISSION.  ONE OF THESE PIECES FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE GEARS ON THE COUNTER SHAFT AND BROKE ONE OF THE TEETH, EXPLAINING THE NOISE.   SO, IN SHORT, WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT AT A COST OF $1800.00 ON A VEHICLE WITH ONLY 37,000 MILES ON IT.  *NM",

IF THERE WERE NOT ANY PROBLEMS THEN WHY WOULD I HAVE RETURNED THE TRUCK 3 MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT? I WOULD LOVE TO TRADE IT IN, BUT I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE AGAIN BY BEING UPSIDE DOWN. I SPOKE WITH A GENTLEMAN AT BERGE FORD AND HE SAID THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT FORD MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY THE TRUCK BACK AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED THEM TO DO AT THIS POINT.

I HAVE A F150 4X4 SUPERCREW, THE OTHER CAR WAS A OLDS' 98 REGENCY FULL SIZE CAR.  MY APPROXIMATE SPEED WAS BETWEEN 20 TO 25 MPH, I HAD JUST CAME FROM ANOTHER INTERSECTION AND HAD NOT REACHED THE SPEED LIMIT QUITE YET.  AFTER HITTING THIS CAR MY TRUCK TRAVELED ANOTHER 20 TO 30 YARDS BEFORE HITTING A 2 PIPE HAND/GUARD RAIL.  THE CORNER POST PLACED A NICE V DEAD CENTER IN MY BUMPER.  THE HOOD WAS BUCKLED, BOTH FRONT QUARTER PANELS DAMAGED AND JAMMED BACK INTO THE DOORS.  MY AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY NOR DID MY SEAT BELTS LOCK IN POSITION TO PREVENT MYSELF FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL WITH MY CHEST.  THE TRUCK WAS REPAIRED BY A RELIABLE COLLISION CENTER APPROVED BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY, STATE FARM INSURANCE.
