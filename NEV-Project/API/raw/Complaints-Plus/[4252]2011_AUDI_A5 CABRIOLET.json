I WOULD GO TO THE DEALER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN THE LIGHT CAME ON AND GET A QUART POURED IN.  I'VE NEVER HAD ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THE CAR AND I HAVE SERVICED IT PERFECTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP.  ABOUT A MONTH AGO I GOT NOTICE OF THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR MY CAR AND IT'S OVERCONSUMPTION OF OIL.  ON MARCH 21ST WHEN I HAD MORE OIL ADDED, WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE OIL OVERSCONSUMPTION PROBLEM TO BE FIXED.  THAT NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.  I STARTED MY CAR.  DROVE ABOUT A BLOCK TO AN INTERSECTION.  STOPPED AT THE LIGHT.  AND THE CAR STOPPED.  THE TIMING CHAIN BROKE AND THE ENGINE IS DESTROYED.  A TIMING CHAIN SHOULD NEVER BREAK.  I AM LUCKY I WAS NOT DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY WHEN THE ENGINE FAILED.  THE OIL OVERCONSUMPTION COULD DEFINITELY LEAD TO THE TIMING CHAIN BREAKING.  AUDI REFUSES TO ADMIT THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS DOCUMENTED.  THERE IS A DOCUMENTED MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN MY ENGINE FOR THE 2011 A5S, BUT THEY REFUSE TO COVER THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT.  IT IS THEIR FAULT.  I WAS SITTING ON A TIME BOMB AND AUDI WAS FULLY AWARE THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN AND THEY NEVER CHECKED AND NEVER MENTIONED IT TO ME.  NOW THEY EXPECT ME TO COVER THE COST OF A NEW ENGINE WHEN IT WAS A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM.  IT CLEARLY STATES IN THE CLASS ACTION SUIT THAT THE DEFECT CAN LEAD TO COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE.  I AM OVER MY WARRANTY, BUT THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER.  THIS DEFECT EXISTED FROM DAY ONE.  THEY NEED TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  *TR",

I HAVE FRIENDS WITH AUDIS EQUIPPED WITH THE 2.0T ENGINE AND THEY HAVE ZERO OIL CONSUMPTION.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE ONLINE BLOGS WITH OTHER AUDI OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
