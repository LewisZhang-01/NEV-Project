MY CAR FIRST BEGAN STALLING AFTER I HAD IT WASHED IN GASOLINE STATION'S AUTOMATIC CAR WASH.  SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS WASHED, THE ENGINE BEGAN RUNNING EXTREMELY ROUGH AND THEN FINALLY STALLED OUT WITH THE 'ENGINE' LIGHT ON YELLOW LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD.    THE FIRST TWO MASTER MECHANICS OF TWO DIFFERENT REPAIR FACILITIES SUGGESTED THAT THE ENGINE'S PCM WAS BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A FORD DEALERSHIP.  I TOOK MY CAR TO A THIRD REPAIR FACILITY AND THE MECHANIC SWAPPED OUT A USED PCM FOR A 4.6 L APPLICATION AND REPROGRAMMED IT FOR FORD'S MOST RECENTLY ISSUED SOFTWARE UPDATE.    THE CAR CONTINUES TO STALL AFTER THE USED PCM WAS REPROGRAMMED AND THE MECHANIC CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS SURE THAT THE STALLING PROBLEM IS NOT RELATED TO THE ENGINE'S PCM!    I'VE PAID APPROXIMATELY $874.00 AMONG THREE DIFFERENT AUTOMOBILE REPAIR FACILITIES AND ALL MASTER MECHANICS AMONG THESE THREE GARAGES COULD NOT PINPOINT WHY MY VEHICLE IS STALLING.  FINALLY, A MASTER MECHANIC OF A VOLUNTEER CHURCH GARAGE ALSO COULD NOT PINPOINT WHY MY CAR CONTINUES TO STALL AND HE SUGGESTS THAT THE ONLY FIX IS TO SELL MY CAR.    WHEN I CALLED A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD TRY TO FIX IT, THE SERVICE MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO REPLICATE THE CONDITIONS THAT MADE IT STALL IN THE FIRST PLACE.  I EXPLAINED THAT THIS METHOD WAS TRIED BY ALL THREE REPAIR FACILITIES, ALL TO NO AVAIL, AND THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING ADDITIONAL FEES FOR FUTURE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT CANNOT PINPOINT THE FAILURE.
