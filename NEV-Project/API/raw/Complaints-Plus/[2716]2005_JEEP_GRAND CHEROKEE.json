I\u2019ve had three computers installed in the  last  Year and a half and have given me 3 close calls almost causing accident. That\u2019s 3 too many. I\u2019m not the only one with the computer issues ask around to owners with these jeeps. How many close called does someone need for Chrysler to not even repair but Just to look into. Do people need to die in an accident for people to take this seriously. The issue is NOT from lack of maintenance either. If my ABS module was failed I would no. My vehicle has a 115,000miles on it and when this dangerous intermittent issues occur there are no DTC codes stored. This is a total epic failure done by Chrysler. If they don\u2019t find something soon about theses vehicles. I will be sure never to by another Jeep product. I don\u2019t drive this vehicle unless I\u2019m alone never-mind one of my niece or nephews With me in this death trap I\u2019ve learned my lesson On this one Chrysler Please help NHTSA!!",

THIS BEING THAT THE SUNROOF HAD NOTHING TO KEEP THE MELTING SNOW OUT OF THE VEHICLE.   SUNROOF IS MADE WITH A FAULTY COG SET THAT WEARS AWAY TOO QUICKLY.  INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SPEND ALMOST ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS I WAS QUOTED IN 2011 FOR THEM TO PLACE IN A NEW COG MADE OF THE SAME BRITTLE PLASTIC.

I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF LANDMARK DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE ENTIRE PANEL WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. THEY QUOTED TO ME A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $600 FOR EACH DOOR, MEANING IT WOULD COST ME ABOUT $2,400 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THIS CAN NOT BE A FLUKE THAT ALL 4 DOORS HAVE THE SAME DEFECT. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND I AM CONCERNED THAT I, OR ANY PASSENGERS I MAY HAVE, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXIT MY VEHICLE BECAUSE OF IT. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT.

THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE HAS BEEN REPLACED (3) TIMES AND WORKS FOR A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR AND THEN THE PROBLEM RETURNS. I FIRST HEARD OF THE SAFETY RECALL - IGNITION SWITCH P41/NHTSA 14V-438 (AS I LATER LEARNED) FROM THE MEDIA. I CALLED THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP TO INQUIRE ON WHEN I COULD BRING THE CAR IN FOR REPAIR. THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PART AND TO CALL BACK WHEN I GET A LETTER SAYING THE PART IS AVAILABLE; THAT WAS ALMOST 6 MONTHS AGO. IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER FROM CHRYSLER INFORMING ME OF THE RECALL. THAT CAME ALMOST 3 MONTH AFTER THE RECALL WAS ON THE NEWS.YESTERDAY, WHILE DRIVING MY CAR ALL THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS CAME ON AND OFF AND MY CAR MOMENTARILY STALLED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. THESE ARE THE SAME ISSUES I'VE BEEN HAVING WHERE THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE HAS BEEN REPLACED AND READING THE SYMPTOMS OF THIS IGNITION SWITCH PROBLEM, I THINK THEY ARE RELATED. I CALLED CHRYSLER'S RECALL ASSISTANCE CENTER TODAY AND WAS ON HOLD FOR 2 HOURS BEFORE I GAVE UP. THERE WAS NO WAY TO LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR CHRYSLER TO CALL ME BACK. THE RECALL HAS BEEN IN AFFECT SINCE JULY 2014 AND HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED IN A REASONABLE TIME. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE AS IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO MYSELF AND OTHERS.

AFTER MY DAILY FAILURES WITH THIS THING I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS VEHICLE FAR SURPASSES THE TWO RECALLS IN MY SHORT 3 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP. I'M MOST UPSET WITH MY DEALERSHIP DUE TO THE FACT THEY FORGOT TO MENTION A FEW HUNDRED DRIVERS OF THIS PRIOR RENTAL TRUCK WITH AN ACCIDENT THAT WAS MORE THAN A SKIP OVER THE CURB. THEY OFFERED BUT NEVER MADE GOOD ON PROVIDING ME WITH OWNERS MANUAL...GUESS THEY WERE WORRIED I WOULD NOTICE THE PAST SAFETY RECALLS THAT WERE NEVER DONE.

I HAVE CONTACTED BOTH THE DEALERSHIP IN MY TOWN AS WELL AS CHRYSLER REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE DOOR PANELS RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL DOOR HANDLES.  THE DEALERSHIPS ARE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR THEM AS WELL AS THE CUSTOMERS.  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE IT BECOMES A REAL PROBLEM.   *TR  AFTER THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED, THE CONSUMER NOTICED THE IGNITION CYLINDER PHYSICALLY EXTENDED OUT FROM THE HOUSING AND WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND AWKWARD TO ENGAGE WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE, THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CAME ON. THE CONSUMER STATED IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE PRIOR TO THE RECALL WORK BEING DONE.  THE DEALER REPEATEDLY TOLD THE CONSUMER THE IGNITION SWITCH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WIPERS.  UPDATED 06/02/16.*JB",

FORTUNATELY, IT HAS NOT RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT (YET).  IT HAPPENED AGAIN JUST LAST WEDNESDAY!  WE DID RECEIVE AT LEAST 2 RECALL NOTICES FROM JEEP, HOWEVER, WHEN WE CALL TO SCHEDULE THE APPOINTMENT, THE DEALERSHIP HAS INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PARTS YET.  I CALLED AGAIN YESTERDAY AND IT WAS THE SAME STORY.  SO I CALLED CHRYSLER DIRECTLY.  THEY GAVE ME THE SAME STORY AND OFFERED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OTHER THAN TIPS TO TRY TO NOT KNOCK THE KEY, WHICH WE HAVE TRIED THEM ALL ALREADY.  THE VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE!!  MY HUSBAND CANNOT BE REPLACED AND I HAVE HEARD CLOSE TO 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF THIS P41 RECALL ALREADY.  HE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER ONE!  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT WHEN A CUSTOMER IS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE, CHRYSLER IS NOT OFFERING ANYTHING TO HELP US OUT UNTIL THE PART IS AVAILABLE.  I WOULD EXPECT THAT OFFERING LOANER JEEP OR WORKING WITH US TO REPLACE THE JEEP WOULD BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A LAWSUIT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO MY HUSBAND.

I'LL BE HAPPY TO WEIGH THE ENTIRE KEYCHAIN AND SEND A PHOTO OF THE DIGITAL SCALE RESULTS, BUT THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF HAVING A LARGE MASS ON THE KEYCHAIN.    THE JEEP ALMOST KILLED ME.

OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PART REPLACED HAVE BEEN UNSUCESSFUL. ON TOP OF THIS MY DEALER WAS TELLING ME I HAD TO PAY FOR THIS PART AND THEY ARE CLAIMING IT IS NOT TIED TO THE N23 RECALL.  WE HAVE NOT PAID TO HAVE THIS PART REPLACED BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT IS CHRYSLERS DOING. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SOFTWARE UPDATES HAVE CAUSED THESE ISSUES TO ARISE AND CHRYLSER IS NOT OWNING UP TO IT.  I FEEL NHTSA NEEDS TO INFORCE THAT WHEN A RECALL IS MADE IT TRUELY NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE FIX REALLY WORKS.  IF ISSUES ARISE WITH A RECALL NHTSA NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THE COMPANY MAKES IT RIGHT.THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CARE CENTER IS A JOKE. NO ONE CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, CONCERNS AND CALLS ARE NOT RETURN.  MAKING US GO BACK AND FORTH FOR UPDATES THAT CONTINUE TO NOT FIX THE REAL PROBLEM AND MAKING US REPLACE PARTS THAT DON'T FIX THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION.  IT FORCES CONSUMERS TO NOT HAVE RECALLS PERFORMED. NHTSA NEEDS MAKE CHRYLSER ANSWER AND FIX THIS CORRECTLY.  A VEHICLE THAT CANNOT GO INTO 4LOW OR NEUTRAL IS JUST AS UNSAFE!  *TR",

THE BELT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TIRE THAT INCLUDES COOPER NAME AND LOGO IS A SEPARATE RUBBER BELT BETWEEN THE TREAD AND THE RUBBER ABOVE THE REAM.  ON MANY TIRES THIS SIDE IS ONE SOLID PIECE, BUT NOT ON THIS PARTICULAR TIRE.  IT LOOKS IT IS MANUFACTURING/ ENGINEERING DEFECT THAT BELT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TIRE EVENTUALLY WILL START SEPARATE ITSELF DUE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VERY HOT WEATHER.   THE TIRE LIKE THAT WOULD NOT PASS QUALITY CONTROL IF IT WERE TESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH NEW STANDARD FOR TIRE MANUFACTURERS.  THUS, THEY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD NO. 139, \"NEW PNEUMATIC RADIAL TIRES FOR LIGHT VEHICLES.\"  THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE WITH COOPER TIRES, THEY ARE NOT CORRECTLY REFLECT MILEAGE THEY CLAIMING IN THE WARRANTY FOR THEIR TIRES.   FOR EXAMPLE, MY MAZDA 6 HAD ARIZONIAN TIRES, WHICH WERE MANUFACTURING BY COOPERS, WHICH SUPPOSE TO LAST 65,000 MILES BUT WERE BETWEEN 3 AND 4/32 AFTER 40,000 MILES.",

IT COULD BE DRIVEN SO I DROVE TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP THERE AND THEY SAID IT THE TRANSFER CASE AND IT WAS ON MAJOR BACK ORDER AND THEY COULDN'T GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHEN IT WOULD BE DONE. WHEN WE ARRIVED HOME IN MANNING, SC, I BROUGHT THE JEEP TO STOKES-CRAVEN JEEP IN MANNING. THEY TOLD ME THERE ARE MORE THAN 550 TRANSFER CASES ON BACK ORDER AND THEY WERE NOT SURE WHEN THEY WOULD ARRIVE. AFTER THEY LOOKED AT THE PART, IT WAS MAKING A LOT OF NOISE SO IT COULDN'T BE DRIVEN. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THIS WAS A RECALL ITEM SINCE THERE WERE SO MANY ON BACK ORDER AND HE SAID THERE WASN'T AT THAT TIME. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT RECALL AND ONLY GOT AN ANSWER ABOUT THE PART, WHICH THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHEN IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  COULD YOU CHECK TO SEE IF THIS SHOULD BE AN ITEM THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO RECALL? PERHAPS YOU CAN GET SOME STRAIGHT ANSWERS.

AFTER A MOMENT OR SO, MY JEEP STARTED ROLLING FORWARD. IT ROLLED BETWEEN THE FUELING ISLANDS & IT WAS HEADED TOWARDS THE STREET.

I AM 100% CONFIDENT THAT I PUT MY JEEP IN PARK BEFORE I GOT OUT OF IT. I WAS SHOCKED & SCARED WHEN I SAW IT ROLLING DOWN THE LOT. I FILED AN ACCIDENT CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY. THE DAMAGE WAS AROUND $6,000. MY DEDUCTIBLE WAS $500.     TODAY, (AUGUST 13, 2013), I RECEIVED A SAFETY RECALL NOTICE FROM CHRYSLER. THE REASON FOR THE RECALL IS THE \"FINAL DRIVE CONTROLLER MODULE SOFTWARE MAY UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSE THE TRANSFER CASE TO SHIFT INTO THE NEUTRAL POSITION WITHOUT INPUT FROM THE DRIVER.

BRAKE WAS APPLIED TO THE POINT OF LITERALLY STANDING ON IT WITH WHOLE BODY WEIGHT BUT CAR DID NOT RESPOND.      FINALLY THE CAR CAME TO A HALT ALTHOUGH ENGINE WAS MAKING REVVING SOUNDS FOR A FEW MORE SECONDS.  LUCKILY NOBODY WAS INSIDE THE LAUNDROMAT.  AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY EVEN THOUGH THE FRONT WAS BADLY DAMAGED.  POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. COP WAS ALSO SURPRISED AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY FOR THIS HARD A CRASH.    THE CAR HAS BEEN OWNED BY ME SINCE NEW FOR 7 YEARS AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED. INSURANCE SENT A SPECIAL TECHNICIAN TO CHECK, BUT NOTHING COULD BE FOUND.  CAR IS MORE THAN LIKELY TOTALED AT THIS POINT.     PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, SOMEONE CAN GET BADLY INJURED FOR LIFE, OR DEATHS CAN OCCUR.  *TR",

I CALLED TO SPEAK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND BELIEVE THE DOORS ARE MADE OF CHEAP OR DEFECTIVE PARTS AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT HELP ME BECAUSE OF THE MILES ON MY CAR. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT HELPING ON THE COSTS, I HAVE HEARD THAT OTHER FOLKS HAVE BEEN HELPED WITH 50% OF THE COSTS. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE A VW AND VOLVO AND THEY ARE NEAR THE SAME AGE AND DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THEM. THE SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE CAN GET OUT OF THE CAR IS TO PUT THE WINDOW DOWN TO OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE. THEY ARE ELECTRIC WINDOWS SO IF IN AN ACCIDENT IT COULD BECOME TRAGIC.

I WENT TO A LOCAL JEEP DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THAT MY WARRANTY IS UP AND THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY RECALLS.  I AM CONCERNED AS IF TWO HANDLES ARE BROKE, IT IS A MATTER OF TIME THE OTHER TWO WILL ALSO BREAK.  I ALSO FIND THIS TO BE A SERIOUS!!!, SAFETY ISSUE AS IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY, HOW WILL A CHILD EXIT MY REAR SEAT IF THEY ARE SITTING BEHIND THE DRIVER AND IF THE HANDLE BREAKS ON THE OTHERSIDE THERE IS NO GETTING OUT FROM WITHIN THE VEHICLE.   THIS OF COURSE CAN RESULT IN THE DEATH OF A PASSENGER.  I HOPE YOUR AGENCY CAN ASSIST ME WITH THIS PROBLEM IN GETTING THESE HANDLES REPLACED BEFORE THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS.    THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.  *TR",

(THE DOOR HANDLE IS SET IN A HOLE MADE OF  THIN PLASTIC THAT FUNCTIONS AS A PIVOT HINGE.  ONCE THE PLASTIC CRACKS THEN THE HANDLE JUST POPS OUT OF THE DOOR PANEL.) THEN IN JANUARY 2011, THE RIGHT REAR DOOR HANDLE DEVELOPED THE SAME PROBLEM AND THIS DOOR HANDLE ALSO CAME OUT OF THE HANDLE HOUSING, AND IT CAN NO LONGER BE OPENED FROM INSIDE THE CAR.  UPON INSPECTION WE DISCOVERED THAT BOTH THE RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER DOOR AND REAR LEFT PASSENGER DOOR HAVE DEVELOPED CRACKS IN THE PLASTIC IN THE SAME PLACE, AND WILL LIKELY BREAK SOON.  WE NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 42 IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS LODGED ON THE NHTSA SITE INVOLVING THIS SAME PROBLEM ON THE 2005 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE.  HERE IN FLORIDA, WITH FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES TO RUN OFF THE ROAD INTO LAKES OR CANALS, THIS PROBLEM IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS, POSSIBLY CAUSING PERSONS TO DROWN IN THE CAR WHEN UNABLE TO UNLATCH THE DOOR IN AN EMERGENCY.    CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF THIS ISSUE AND THEY DO NOT FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD COVER THE REPAIRS IF THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.   SOME OTHER PERSONS WHO HAVE REPORTED THE ISSUE STATE THAT TO REPAIR THE DOOR HANDLE REQUIRES A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE SIDE DOOR PANELS AT A COST OF OVER $700 PER DOOR.

I AM CONTACTING MY DEALERSHIP TO TRY TO GET THE ISSUE RESOLVED. ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL THE BRAKE TRANSMISSION INTERLOCK SYSTEM FAILED ON MY VEHICLE. YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER IN THE P (PARK) POSITION WHEN THE IGNITION SWITCH IS IN THE LOCK POSITION. TO MOVE THE GEAR SELECTOR LEVER OUT OF THE P (PARK) POSITION, THE IGNITION SWITCH MUST BE TURNED TO THE ON POSITION, AND THE BRAKE PEDAL MUST BE DEPRESSED.  *TR",

SO I CALL CHRYSLER TO SEE IF THEY WILL PRORATE THE BATTERY BEING I'VE ONLY THE JEEP 2 YEARS AND IT'S ONLY 3 YEARS OLD.  WELL OF COURSE THEY SAY NO.  WHEN YOU PURCHASE ONE OF THEIR CARS THE BATTERY IS ONLY WARRANTED FOR 36 MONTHS OR 36,000 MILES BUT IF I GO BUY THE EXACT SAME BATTERY NOW THEY WILL WARRANTY IT FOR  72 MONTHS.  TO ME THIS DOES NOT SOUND ACCURATE BUT THEY REFUSE TO HELP IN ANYWAY.  THEY SAID THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I AM NOT ASKING FOR SOMETHING FOR FREE BUT I BELIEVE THE BATTERY SHOULD BE PRORATED.  *TR",

KNOWING THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO UNTIL A STALL COULD BE DELIBERATELY DEMONSTRATED, I CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT UNTIL SEPTEMBER, WHEN THE STALLING BECAME MORE FREQUENT THAN THE NORMAL EVERY-2-MONTH AVERAGE AND NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND BRAKES.

I PRESSED THE CO-PILOT TRIGGER TO CAPTURE THE DATA BOTH TIMES.  WHEN THEY GOT THE JEEP BACK, THEY SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING INDICATING THE ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING ON TWO OCCASIONS.  CHRYSLER RECOMMENDED THEY REPLACE THE EGR VALVE AND THE PURGE SOLENOID, WHICH THEY DID.  THIS MORNING IT STALLED AGAIN. I UPDATED CHRYSLER AND THE DEALER ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

I TOOK THE JEEP BACK TO MY SERVICE GARAGE AND THEY TOLD ME MY A/C COMPRESSOR WAS FAILING AND UPON CHECKING WITH THE LOCAL PARTS SUPPLIER, MY MECHANIC TOLD ME HE COULD NOT BUY A REPLACEMENT COMPRESSOR ... I MUST GO TO A JEEP DEALER. I DID AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A NATIONAL BACK ORDER AND I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST 3 WEEKS FOR A REPLACEMENT. KEEP IN MIND THE ENGINE HAS ONE BELT, SO AT ANY TIME THE COMPRESSOR COULD FREEZE UP AND I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE ONCE THE BELT BROKE. I DID A LOT OF PHONE CALLING AND FOUND A COMPRESSOR IN ILLINOIS .. IT WAS DELIVERED AND INSTALLED FOR $550.00. SO, WITHIN A WEEK I SPENT OVER $900.00 FOR REPAIRS. THE JEEP  WAS A DEALER DEMO, SO I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT THE JEEP WITH LESS THAN 1,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",

MY 2005 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE (4.7L AT) STALLS OR NEARLY STALLS WHILE COMING TO A STOP, OR ACCELERATING FROM A STOP.  THE LAST REPORTED INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE APPROACHING A STOPLIGHT.  SINCE THAT INITIAL COMPLAINT, I HAVE SPENT 19 HOURS OVER 3 VISITS TO THE DEALER TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  AFTER REPLACING A SOLENOID IN THE THROTTLE ASSEMBLY, THE CONDITION SEEMED TO IMPROVE, BUT HAS SINCE REGRESSED TO PRE-REPAIR STATUS.  I HAVE RECEIVED NO FEEDBACK CONCERNING MY ORIGINAL COMPLAINT FROM NHTSA, NOR HAVE I BEEN NOTIFIED BY DAIMLER-CHRYSLER OF ANY DEVELOPMENTS IN CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM.  RELYING ON DC'S INITIATIVE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE AND NECESSARY REPAIR FOR THIS ISSUE SEEMS IRRESPONSIBLE SINCE THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO IN THE TWO YEARS THAT MY MODEL HAS BEEN ON THE STREET.      ALSO, IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE PERSONAL INITIATIVE OF THE MECHANIC THAT REPLACED THE SOLENOID, I WOULDN'T HAVE RECEIVED ANY HELP WITH MY PROBLEM.  THE DEALER POSITION WAS THAT THERE WAS NO COMPUTER REGISTERED EVENT, SO THEREFORE, THE STALLING HAD NOT OCCURRED.  WHEN THEY COULD PERSONALLY OBSERVE THE EVENT, AND CAPTURE IT IN THE VEHICLE COMPUTER, THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER TO SEE IF ANY REPAIR WAS WARRANTED.     THE SURVEY BELOW ASKS ABOUT PROPERTY DAMAGE, DEATHS, AND FIRES.  DO I NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE ONE OF THESE EVENTS OCCUR TO MY FAMILY TO FLAG MY COMPLAINT FOR APPROPRIATE ACTION?  KNOWING A VEHICLE STALLS WHILE BRAKING AND ACCELERATING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND NOT AGGRESSIVELY DETERMINING THE CAUSE UNTIL A FATAL ACCIDENT OCCURS SEEMS IRRESPONSIBLE.  HOPEFULLY, I DO NOT HEAR ABOUT THIS INEVITABLE RECALL THE SAME WAY MY FIRESTONE PATRON PAL DID.  (FROM THE TOW TRUCK OPERATOR, POST-ACCIDENT).

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE VEHICLES SEAT AND INABILITY TO REMOVE THE HEAD REST, WE WERE UNABLE TO SAFELY SECURE HER CAR SEAT IN THE RIGHT REAR SEAT POSITION.  WE HAVE SINCE TRIED TO INSTALL TWO OTHER CHILD SEATS AND NEITHER WORKED.  THEREAFTER, WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM CHRISTIANA HOSPITAL WHO IS CERTIFIED BY THE NHTSA INSTALL THE SEAT AND SHE TOO WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE'S SEAT DESIGN AND HEADREST.  WE HAVE RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND DAIMLER CHRYSLER BUT THEY SIMPLY TELL US TO CONSULT OUR OWNER'S MANUAL AND SEATCHECK.ORG.  HOWEVER, I HAVE READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL SEVERAL TIMES AND IT STATES THAT A CHILD'S SEAT CAN BE INSTALLED IN ANY OF THE REAR SEAT POSITIONS.  MOREOVER, THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE HOSPITAL THAT ATTEMPTED TO INSTALL THE SEAT IS ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS YOU ARE DIRECTED TO FROM THE WWW.SEATCHECK.ORG WEBSITE.   THUS, I HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO TURN SO I THOUGHT THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO DO WOULD BE FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA.  *JB",

SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS BRAND NEW IT STALLED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS - SOMETIMES WHEN I  WAS AT A STOP, AND OTHER TIMES WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS AT RATED SPEEDS! I  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AT LEAST 5-6 TIMES FOR THIS  PROBLEM, AND  THEY HAVE FINALLY ADMITTED THAT CHRYSLER WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS  ON THIS ENGINE, BUT NO ONE  COULD  OFFER A  SOLUTION.  I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVES, WHO  WERE ALWAYS VERY COURTEOUS, BUT NO ONE HAS OFFERED  A SOLUTION. THE LAST CHRSYLER REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO WAS TO  RECOMMEND TO ME TO TRADE THE VEHICLE IN. WHEN I EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD TAKE A LOSS  ON THE TRADE-IN VALUE , LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD BUT 48000 MILES HE SUGGESTED THAT A CHRYSLER DISTRICT MANAGER WOULD BE IN CONTACT AND COULD MAYBE HELP SOFTEN THE FINANCIAL BLOW.

A COUPLE HOURS AFTER MY TRUCK WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP WHERE A CLAIM WAS PROCESSED AND SENT IN. TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING AN ADJUSTER CAME AND LOOKED AT IT IMMEDIATELY DENYING MY CLAIM. I GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL SAYING IT WAS NOT A FAULTY PART AND IT WAS NOT CHRYSLERS RESPONSIBILITY. THE MANAGER AT THIS CHRYSLER DEALER STATED THAT HE ALMOST GOT ARGUING WITH THE ADJUSTER BECAUSE HE CLAIMED MY ARM WAS TWISTED BUT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE TWIST IN IT. I CONTACTED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND THEY ALL HAVE LOOKED AT IT GIVING ME LETTERS OF OPINION THAT THIS IS DUE TO A FAULTY PART. THE CONTROL ARMS ON THESE PARTICULAR MODELS ARE MADE OUT OF POT METAL WHICH IS GROUNDED UP RECYCLED METAL MELTED TOGETHER. CHRYSLER MANUFACTURER PAINTED THEM BLACK TO GIVE IT A CAST IRON LOOK. THE NEXT STEP WAS MY INSURANCE COMPANY, I CONTACTED THEM, AN ADJUSTER CAME OUT. MY INSURANCE PAID FOR MY BODY DAMAGE TO BE FIXED BUT WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE MECHANICAL PARTS OR THE OTHER LADY'S CAR BECAUSE THEY SAID IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT CHRYSLERS RESPONSIBILITY. IF ANYONE HAS HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN PLEASE CONTACT ME. I NEED HELP WITH THIS.  *NM",

MY FIRST WARRANTY VISIT FOR THE VIBRATION PROBLEM WAS MADE ON 18 JULY 2005. THE DIAGNOSIS THERE WAS A BAD TIRE, WHICH I HAD REPLACED AT A GOODYEAR TIRE SHOP PER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. IT HAD NO EFFECT ON THE VIBRATION. I HAVE SINCE BEEN IN TO JIM CLICK CHRYSLER JEEP IN TUCSON ON THREE OCCASIONS FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT FULL DAYS. THE VIBRATION PERSISTS. I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD BE UNABLE TO HAVE FURTHER REPAIR ATTEMPTS WITHOUT DIRECTION FROM CHRYSLER ENGINEERING.  THE LATEST REPAIR ATTEMPT RESULTED IN A MODIFICATION TO THE DRIVE SHAFT BY ADDING SIX  WEIGHTS AT POSITIONS ON THE DRIVE SHAFT. AFTER THIS ACTIVITY, WHICH DID NOT FIX THE VIBRATION, I WAS TOLD THAT THE REMAINING VIBRATION WAS \" IN THE DESIGN\". I HAD A  LOCAL RESPECTED AUTOMOTIVE SHOP EVALUATE THE VIBRATION AND THEY CONCLUDED  IT HAD A PROBLEM. I ASKED THREE FELLOW ENGINEERS TO EVALUATE THE VIBRATION AND  ALL CONCLUDED THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING MY 3 MONTH OLD 2005 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE ON OCTOBER 24TH (NOT THE 17TH) WHEN THE ENGINE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING.  HE WAS DRIVING IN THE LEFT LANE OF A BUSY HIGHWAY DURING RUSH HOUR IN THE RAIN.  HE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AFTER REACHING THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  HE THEN STOPPED AT A SERVICE STATION BUT THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD TO TELL MY HUSBAND TO DRIVE WITH THE DEFROST ON TO KEEP THE ENGINE IDLE UP.  I THEN MADE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT AND ASKED TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AT THE SAME TIME.  THEY KEPT THE TRUCK OVERNIGHT AND SAID THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS DID NOT REVEAL ANY PROBLEM AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE INCIDENT.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THEY DISCOVERED A \"MILKY\" SUBSTANCE WHEN CHANGING THE OIL AND PUT IN A NEW FILTER.  THEY DID NOT SAY THAT THIS WAS THE PROBLEM.  THEY TOLD ME THAT IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN, I SHOULD BRING IT BACK.  MY ISSUE IS THAT WAITING FOR A VEHICLE TO STALL AT HIGH SPEED ON A BUSY HIGHWAY IS A REAL SAFETY CONCERN.

FORTUNATELY, JUST BEFORE SHE STEPPED INTO THE OPEN DOOR THE CAR ACCELERATED RAPIDLY BACKWARD AT FULL THROTTLE UNTIL I COULD HIT THE BREAKS HARD. THE CAR WENT APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET.

THE CAR THEN LEAPED FORWARD AT HIGH ACCELERATION SMASHING OFF TWO MAILBOXES MOUNDED ON A 4*4 POST SPLITTING IT IN HALF, THEN WENT APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET BEFORE CRASHING THROUGH A SNOW BANK AND HITTING A LARGE WOODED HEDGE. DAMAGE WAS LIMITED TO LARGE SCRATCH IN THE HOOD, SMALL DENTS ABOVE HEAD LIGHT, DENT ON FRONT QUARTER PANEL , AND SMALL DENT ON RIGHT DOOR. WE HAVE FILED A POLICE REPORT, CONTACTED OUR INSURANCE AGENT, AND CONTACTED CHRYSLER WHO PROMISED TO DO AN INVESTIGATION NEXT WEEK. MY ASSESSMENT IS THE BREAK PEDAL, AND THE GAS PEDAL IS 2.5 INCHES APART, AND WHEN YOU SLOWLY APPLY THE BREAK IT WILL SQUASH TO THE POINT THAT IT IS AT OR BELOW THE GAS PEDAL LEVEL.

TO ME THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN THAT COULD GET SOMEONE INJURED OR KILLED IF IN TRAFFIC. I REMOVED ALL OTHER KEYS AND EVEN THE RING FROM THE IGNITION KEY TO TRY TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  WITH THIS INFORMATION, THE DEALER HAS AGREED TO REPLACE THE IGNITIION CYLINDER; I ASKED THAT THEY CHECK THE OTHER GRAND CHEROKEES TO SEE IF IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET  RESPONDED.  TO ME AS AN ENGINEER, THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS:  THE IGNITION SWITCH IS VERY LOW ON THE DASHBOARD WHERE THE KEY CAN EASILY BE HIT, AND THE TWO POSITIONS ON THE SWITCH ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, MAKING THIS PROBLEM EASY TO OCCUR.  IF THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST WEAKNESS IN THE SPRING IN THE IGNITION, THIS IS EVEN MORE LIKELY.*AK",
