It made a horrible noise like it was struggling to start and the engine revel\u2019s up like the gas pedal was stuck out it wasn\u2019t.  I immediately turned car off because it sounded like it was going to explode.

(Pic of email attached) This component has not been inspected by anyone. I would be willing to make the vehicle available for inspection upon request. This issue compromises safety because I have to set my parking brake, as I park on an incline and my truck rolls back a little each time I put it in park, or release the parking brake.

NOW, IT WILL NO LONGER SHUT-OFF REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY TIMES THE ENGINE IS RESTARTED AND THE STICK-SHIFT IS MOVED OUT OF PARK & BACK. HAVE RESORTED TO UNPLUGGING THE BATTERY EVERY TIME WE EXIT THE VEHICLE TO KEEP IT FROM BEING DRAINED. THE VEHICLE HAS ALSO NOT RE-STARTED AT ALL(TAKING 15 MINUTES OF RE-ENGAGING THE STARTER BUTTON AT ITS WORST). LEAVING MY WIFE & TODDLERS STUCK IN 100PLUS DEGREE HEAT. WHEN IT DOES NOT RE-START, THE DASH DISPLAY READS THE VEHICLE AT \"0 MPH\" AND ALLOWS THE GEARS TO BE SHIFTED. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE STATING SIMILAR ISSUES. SOME HAVE RESOLVED WITH A CHANGE OF THE SHIFTER MECHANISM, & OTHERS STILL WITH CONTINUED ISSUES AFTER THAT.  THE DEALERSHIP STATED THERE IS ONLY 1 PART LEFT IN TOWN, AND THAT IT IS ON BACK-ORDER AND THEY CAN'T GET IT FROM THE MANUFACTURER(THEY TRIED THEIR TWO NATIONWIDE WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS). NOT ONLY THAT, THE DEALERSHIP SAID WE NEEDED TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE WITH THEM AND THEY WOULD NOT EVEN \"LOOK AT IT\" FOR UP TO 1.5 WEEKS, AND THAT THEY WERE OUT OF LOANER VEHICLES. THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, AND WAS PURCHASED CERTIFIED-USED.  NOTHING HAS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE OR WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT/STOP-SIGN, BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT \"COULD\" HAPPEN.",

WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I ATTEMPTED TO STEP ON THE GAS AND PULL FORWARD, BUT THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARDS. I LOOKED DOWN TO SEE IF I WAS IN REVERSE, BUT THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE. THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT OCCURRED A TOTAL OF TWO TIMES.     ON APRIL 23, 2019 AROUND 9:40 AM I WAS DRIVING AND MY CAR STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THIS TRIP. I WAS NOT SURE IF THE CAR WAS GOING TO MAKE IT TO MY FINAL DESTINATION. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED.       ON APRIL 24, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR SHOWED 4 'CODES'.     P0011 'A' CAMSHAFT POSITION ' TIMING OVER-ADVANCED OR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE BANK 1    P0014 'B' CAMSHAFT POSITION ' TIMING OVER-ADVANCED OR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE BANK 1    P0021 'A' CAMSHAFT POSITION ' TIMING OVER-ADVANCED OR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE BANK 2    P0024 'B' CAMSHAFT POSITION ' TIMING OVER-ADVANCED OR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE BANK 2       THESE CODES REPRESENTED A SOFTWARE PROBLEM RELATED TO THE ENGINE. TIM INFORMED ME THAT ACCORDING TO THE GM BULLETIN (PIP5568E OR DOCUMENT ID# 5251270), THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO DELETE THE CODES AND THAT THERE IS NOT A SOFTWARE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AT THIS TIME. THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE SYMPTOMS I WAS EXPERIENCING RELATED TO THE CODES HE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE GM BULLETIN AND HE WOULD BE ESCALATING THE ISSUE TO THE GM DISTRICT MANAGER.     THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS THAT THEY WANT TO DELETE THE CODES AND HAVE ME COME PICK UP THE CAR AS THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE AT THIS TIME.",

UPON RELEASING THE BRAKE TO ACCELERATE THRU THE INTERSECTION THE VEHICLE STARTED JERKING AND LURCHING UNCONTROLLABLY THEN SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WENT DARK.

BOTH TIMES I WAS TOLD THE PARTS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THIS IS A LARGE PROBLEM.

CONTACTED GM ON 9 FEB, AND COMPLETED AN APPLICATION FOR WHAT I WAS LET TO BELIEVE WAS A 'BUY BACK' OF MY VEHICLE. THE GM REP INFORMED ME THAT SOMEONE WOULD CONTACT ME WITHIN TWO DAYS.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.  I CALLED GM BACK ON 13 FEB, SPOKE WITH ANOTHER REP WHO HAD NO CLUE AS TO WHY I WAS CALLING. THIS REP ASKED FOR 72 HOURS, AND WOULD GET BACK TO ME.  ON 20 FEB, I RCVD A CALL FROM THE GM REP WHO STATED THAT GM CAN ONLY DO A BUY BACK AFTER 3 OR MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE.  BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I BOUGHT A 46,000 DOLLAR PIECE OF JUNK, AND OF COURSE, NO ONE WANTS IT BACK.  AND GM IS MORE THAN AWARE THIS PROBLEM EXISTS...
