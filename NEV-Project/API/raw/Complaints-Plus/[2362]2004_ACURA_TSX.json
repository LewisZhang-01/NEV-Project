I TOOK IT TO 3 DIFFERENT MECHANICS INCLUDING MY STATE INSPECTION MECHANIC  AND THEY TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO GO BAD. I WAS ALSO TOLD THESE TRANSMISSIONS CAME FAULTY IN A LOT OF HONDA CARS AND HONDA WAS TO REPLACE THEM AT NO COST. MY QUESTION IS IF MY CAR FALLS INTO THIS WARRANTY ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW THE YEAR OF CAR IS OLD BUT THE CAR LOOKS AND RUNS LIKE NEW. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SOLVE THIS MATTER MAYBE THERE IS A RECALL THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF AND MAYBE IT CAN BE REPAIRED THRU THE MANUFACTURER SINCE THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE AND COSTLY ISSUE TO TAKE CARE OF ON MY OWN.

I was advised due to their visual inspection of the ECM( Electronic control module)(electrical computer) not having corrosion, they will not change the unit but they have decided to replace the cover on the unit.  I've filed a concerning complaint to Acura headquarters due to  my knowledge of cars to have it on file what was told to me before receiving the vehicle.  Due to my knowledge a faulty ECM can trigger numerous faults within the vehicles performance.Prior to bringing the vehicle to the dealership, I've been experiencing heavy misfires, poor radio connection, no interior lights and triggered headlights. I've replaced the necessary mechanics that would normal be the cause of these issues and the problem was still existing. The last option was the ECM,which fueled my search of a recall on these models for a faulty ECM. A few weeks later I've contacted another dealership in hopes they would take care of the problem, the representative was polite and reassured me the recall was suppose to be replaced with a new unit under manufacturer policy. However this could not be done because the previous dealer has marked the vehicle as a completed task.  So I filed another complaint and have not received any further notice regarding my concern.  A few weeks later I had the vehicle diagnosed and realized the ECM was never replaced nor removed out of the vehicle for inspection. Pictures and video where taken of this unit,as you can see the build up of dirt and dust from its original installment back in 2004. Later reading the review of that specific dealership, I've learned their has been numerous complaints regarding poor service at that locations service department.",

NO LIGHTS WORK AND THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHILE TRYING TO ADJUST TEMPERATURE OR RADIO WHILE DRIVING.  THE ONLY THING THAT LIGHTS UP IS THE WINDOW ON THE RADIO, NO BUTTONS.  YOU HEAR THE HORROR STORIES OF TEXTING WHILE DRIVING WELL THIS ACURA MALFUNCTION IS JUST AS DANGEROUS.  I LOVE MY CAR AND WITH ACURA'S REPUTATION YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE CARS WITH THIS PROBLEM OUT THERE, THE PUBLIC JUST IS NOT AWARE OF YOUR WEBSITE TO ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUES.  AN INVESTIGATION TO ACURA OWNERS WOULD BE A WISE DECISION.  UPON RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET THE PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO FOLLOW THE DASH LIGHTS NOT WORKING IS THE CD PLAYER QUITS.  THAT HAS NOW HAPPENED WITH MY VEHICLE AND THE DISCS ARE STUCK IN THE PLAYER.  THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIGH END CAR AND IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER THAT ACURA DOESN'T FIX THIS ISSUE UNDER A SAFETY RECALL.   AFTERALL, WHAT IS MORE COSTLY A NEW AUDIO SYSTEM THAT SUPPOSEDLY WILL FIX ALL PROBLEMS OR MY DEATH BECAUSE OF A SAFETY ISSUE THAT ACURA FAILED TO FIX WHEN THE KNEW THAT FAR MORE THAN A FEW CARS HAD EXACT SAME ISSUE.  I HAVE SAVED ALL MY RESEARCH AND ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE SAFETY ISSUE FIXED.  OPERATING THIS VEHICLE AT NIGHT IS A HUGE DANGER WHEN YOU CAN'T SAFELY OPERATE THE COMPONENTS THAT CAME ON YOUR CAR BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.

I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED MY OIL AND FOUND I WAS LOW SO I THOUGHT THE HOSE WAS PART OF MY OIL DELIVERY SYSTEM (BECAUSE I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MOTOR AREA OF MY VEHICLE). I IMMEDIATELY MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY SERVICE GARAGE (NOT AN ACURA DEALER BUT WORKED FOR ACURA FOR MANY YEARS) AND HE TOLD ME MY OIL WAS NOT A PROBLEM, THAT IT WAS THE POWER STEERING HOSE THAT WAS LEAKING FLUID ON MY MOTOR.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON THE TLS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM  UPON HIS RECOMMENDATION, I CALLED MY LOCAL ACURA DEALER AND TALKED TO THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE JIMMY THOMAS ON DECEMBER 1 AND HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO FOR ME OTHER THAN ORDER THE PART AND REPLACE IT CHARGING FULL PRICE OF LABOR AND PARTS.  MY ACURA IS ONE OF HIGHER MILEAGE THAN USUAL (126,000) BECAUSE IT WAS USED BY A PHARMACEUTICAL REPRESENTATIVE BEFORE I OWNED IT BUT ANYHOW I STILL BELIEVE MY HOSE WAS PROBABLY MADE FROM THE SAME DEFECTIVE MATERIAL THAT THE TLS WERE.  I CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE FOR ACURA AND TALKED WITH ANDREA (WHO ALSO TOLD ME SHE WAS THE MANAGER ON DUTY) AND SHE KEPT REPEATING TO ME THAT SINCE MY MODEL WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL, I WAS FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS RELATED TO THIS REPAIR ESPECIALLY SINCE MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WAS A \"HIGH MILEAGE\" CAR.   I OWNED A 1997 ACURA 2.5TL BEFORE THIS ONE AND TRADED IT IN ON THIS ONE WHEN IT HAD 230,000 MILES ON IT AND I NEVER HAD ONE DAY TROUBLE OUT OF IT SO I DIDN'T NOT TAKE THAT AS A CORRECT RESPONSE.  I ASKED HER WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR ACURA TO PAY A SMALL FEE NOW INSTEAD OF LARGER FEE IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT AND SHE KEPT REPEATING TO ME THAT MY MODEL HAD NOT BEEN RECALLED AND IT WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY.  SO I AM REGISTERING THIS COMPLAINT. *TR",
