I went to the dealership on May 24, 2021 and I am still waiting for them to call me telling me that they have the part. Meanwhile, I am having lots of trouble stepping on the brake to start the car.  Frequently it takes me up to 10 minutes before I can get the car started.  Yesterday (9/19), I gave up trying to start the car.  Today, (9/20) I had problems each time I tried to use the car, taking 5-10 minutes each time. The first time I went to the dealership, the technician said he didn't know why the notice was sent out because they didn't have the parts. The dealership is Ray Brandt Nissan 4000 Lapalco Blvd., Marrero, LA 70072.   I could not evacuate for Hurricane Ida because I could not be sure that I would be able to start my car or that my brake lights would work in stop an go traffice.

I THEN FOUND OUT THAT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I PURCHASED FROM THE DEALER EXPIRED ALREADY AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A TRANSMISSION IN A CAR THAT I JUST BOUGHT LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH I FOUND WHERE NISSAN HAS A REALLY BAD ISSUE WITH THEIR CVT TRANSMISSIONS AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THEM. WHEN I ASKED NISSAN DEALER ABOUT IT THEY SAID THAT IT ONLY COVERS UP TO 2017 NISSAN SENTRA. MY DAD DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN REFERENCE (NTB20-035A) FOR 2018-2019 NISSAN SENTRA; CVT JUDDER. WHEN WE CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR ASSISTANCE THEY SAID THAT MY CAR WASN'T INCLUDED IN THIS, AND THAT THEY WOULDN'T COVER ANYTHING.
