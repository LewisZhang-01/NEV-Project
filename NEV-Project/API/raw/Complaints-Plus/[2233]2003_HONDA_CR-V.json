        "summary": "The SRS light in my Honda CRV recently went on, and remains on, when the vehicle is in operation. Last week, I took the car to Honda of Princeton (local Honda dealer), who diagnosed the problem as a DTC 15-3 Faulty OPDS Sensor, and further explained that this faulty sensor could potentially cause the passenger-side airbag (replaced in a prior Honda CRV recall)  to NOT deploy in the event of an accident.  Indeed, the repair documentation included a dealer statement that I had been made aware of the issue.  I paid for this diagnostic work, which was overseen by [XXX], who is a service lane manager at the dealer (Tel: [XXX]).  The dealer said it would NOT assume financial responsibility for the replacement of this faulty sensor since the defect is not currently the subject of a Honda product recall, and stressed that this defect is not covered by the various Honda airbag recalls, even though the faulty sensor could impair airbag deployment in an accident.  This faulty sensor may cause non-deployment of the passenger-side airbag, and it would therefore seem self-evident that the defect places the safety of any front-seat passenger in my Honda CRV at grave risk. Today, I called American Honda Motor Company (Tel: 888-234-2138) concerning the faulty sensor, and spoke with \"[XXX]\", who opened Case #[XXX] based on our call.  [XXX] said the faulty sensor is not currently the subject of a Honda product recall.  She also confirmed (I had already found the bulletin online and asked about it) that the Honda CRV's faulty OPDS sensor was the subject of Honda Service Bulletin 06-006, which extended the warranty to 10 years for the faulty sensor, but she noted that the faulty OPDS sensor was no longer covered by this service bulletin or warranty. [XXX] said that American Honda Motor Co. would not assume financial responsibility for the faulty OPDS sensor on this basis, but suggested that I try to 'work with' the local Honda dealer to address the problem.

WHEN I HAD MY 2003 CRV SERVICED AT SUPERIOR HONDA OF OMAHA DUE TO AN SRS LIGHT PROBLEM DIAGNOSED, THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE SRS CONTROL MODULE.

THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT WHEN THE SRS ILLUMINATES, THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THE AIRBAG AND SEATBELT SYSTEM WILL NOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY, SO FOR SAFETY CONCERNS I AGREED TO THE REPLACEMENT.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE OFFICES AND SPOKE TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (NICKY).  SHE GAVE ME A COMPLAINT REFERENCE # 04820522 AND I WAS THEN REFERRED TO HER SUPERVISOR LIZ.

I DISAGREE.

HE WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE VEHICLE, AND FURTHER CLOSE THE HOOD.  THE WINDSHIELD IS SHATTERED, AND THERE IS DAMAGE TO THE HOOD.  THE FORCE CAUSED TWO AREAS OF THE HOOD TO BEND NEAR THE WINDSHIELD.

I JUST GAVE UP AND DON'T KEEP ANYTHING IN THE CRV WITH ANY HINT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ON IT OR PROPERTY I'M NOT PREPARED TO LOSE.  I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE CAR DUE TO THEFT. OR HAVE SOMEONE PULL THE HOOD RELEASE AND STEAL BATTERY, ENGINE PARTS,...  HONDA IS WORTHLESS.",

THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT ASSURED ME IT HAD.  I SHOWED THE SERVICE TECH THE SCREW AND HE SAID THAT IT WAS INDEED THE SAME SCREW THAT THE AIRBAG INFLATOR WAS SECURED WITH INSIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  BUT HE TOLD ME IT WAS ONE OF THE OLD SCREWS AND THEY HAD TO PUT NEW AND DIFFERENT SCREWS IN WITH THE NEW INFLATOR.  I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE WORK AT THIS DEALER.  WHEN I SPOKE TO THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP SOME TIME LATER HE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE SCREW WAS RELATED TO THEIR WORK.  BLAME THE CUSTOMER SEEMS TO BE HONDA'S MODUS OPERANDI THESE DAYS. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS SHODDY & SHADY IN MY OPINION.

SO I PLACED A TINY PIECE OF MASKING TAPE ON THE INSIDE LIP OF THE STEERING WHEEL COVER TO MAKE SURE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY REMOVE IT.  WHEN MY WIFE RETURNED HOME WITH THE CAR, THE TAPE WAS STILL THERE.  I HAD ATTACHED IT LOOSELY AND IT FELL OFF AS SOON AS I TOUCHED IT.  THIS SHOULD HAVE FALLEN OFF WITH THE STEERING COVER REMOVAL.  BEFORE DOING THIS SWAP, THE BATTERY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE DISCONNECTED.  I CHECKED THE RADIO AND ALL THE CHANNELS WERE STILL PRESET, YET THE MEMORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIPED WHEN THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED.  THE RADIO CODE WAS WRITTEN IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL SO THEY COULD HAVE RESET THE CHANNELS BUT THAT WOULD BE UNLIKELY FOR THEM TO DO.  I ASKED MY WIFE WHICH CD WAS PLAYING WHEN SHE LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AND SHE SAID THE SAME ONE THAT WAS PLAYING WHEN I ARRIVED THERE.  AFTER DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY AND RESETTING THE RADIO, THE CD PLAYER WILL START PLAYBACK AT DISC 1, TRACK 1.  NOW THEY MAY HAVE DONE THE WORK WITHOUT ACTUALLY DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY BUT I WAS NOT CONVINCED SO I REMOVED THE STEERING COVER MYSELF.  THE SERIAL NUMBER FOR THE NEW AIRBAG ON MY INVOICE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ON THE AIRBAG IN THE CAR.  IT IS A TAKATA AIRBAG STILL, BUT I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE PROVIDING THE NEW AIRBAGS.

HE SPOKE TO DEXTER, WHO PROMISED HE WOULD CALL BACK WHEN THE PARTS WERE IN STOCK WITHIN 7 TO 10 DAYS.   AGAIN THERE WAS NO RETURN CALL.  SO MY HUSBAND CALLED AGAIN ON NOVEMBER 11.  THIS TIME DEXTER SAID THAT THE PARTS \"COULD BE ON BACK ORDER FOR TWO MONTHS.\"  WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE SAFETY CONCERNS OF DRIVING WITH THESE DEMONSTRABLY DANGEROUS AIRBAGS, DISTRESSING BECAUSE THERE IS REGULARLY A BABY IN THE CAR, DEXTER ADVISED THAT THE AIRBAG FUSE BE REMOVED UNTIL THE SITUATION WAS REMEDIED.    ONCE MORE WE RECEIVED NO PHONE CALLS FROM THE DEALERSHIP.  THUS ANOTHER CALL WAS MADE ON JANUARY 06, 2015.  MY HUSBAND AGAIN SPOKE TO DEXTER, WHO REPEATED THAT HE WOULD CALL BACK IN 7 TO 10 DAYS.  PREDICTABLY, NO ONE CALLED.  ANOTHER CALL WAS PLACED BY MY HUSBAND ON JANUARY 15.  THIS TIME, AT LAST, DEXTER MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR JANUARY 23.    ON THE 23RD, THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG WAS REPLACED, AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PARTS FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE WERE UNAVAILABLE (NO FURTHER EXPLANATION).  THEY WOULD NEED TO BE ORDERED.

EACH OF THESE SPORADIC ISSUES HAPPEN WITH TWO OTHER HONDA-MADE \"SIDEWINDER\" KEYS FOR THE CAR, WHICH ARE LIKE NEW.  (THE MAIN KEY IS ALWAYS USED FOR THE IGNITION AND IS WORN THEREFROM.)  5.  THE OTHER LOCKS ON THE CAR (IGNITION, FRONT PASSENGER & 5TH DOOR) DO NOT EXPERIENCE THESE PROBLEMS.  HONDA SERVICE CLAIMS THE LOCKS PINS HAVE WORN OUT.  HOW CAN THE LOCK PINS WEAR OUT WHEN THEY ARE BARELY USED?  IF THE PINS HAVE WORN OUT, WHY DOES THE KEY GO ALL THE WAY INTO THE LOCK SOMETIMES?  AND WHY DOES THE LOCK WORK PERFECTLY SOMETIMES?

MY MECHANIC TRACKED THE PROBLEM TO THE MASTER WINDOW SWITCH AND REMOVED IT. THE MASTER SWITCH HAD MELTED AND THE MECHANIC STATED THAT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ELECTRICAL FIRE HAD I CONTINUED TO USE IT. HONDA HAS SINCE ISSUED RECALLS ON THE MASTER WINDOW SWITCH FOR 2002-2006 HONDA CRVS, HOWEVER MINE WAS NOT INCLUDED; HONDA STATED THAT THE RECALL WAS VIN-SPECIFIC AND MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED. THE RECALL ANNOUNCED ON OCT. 6, 2012 STATED \"OVER TIME, EXPOSURE TO WATER AND OTHER FLUIDS CAN CAUSE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE IN THE SWITCH, WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN CAUSE THE SWITCH TO OVERHEAT AND MELT, DAMAGING THE SWITCH AND POTENTIALLY DAMAGING AN ASSOCIATED WIRE HARNESS. ADDITIONALLY IF A SWITCH MELTS, IT COULD PRODUCE SMOKE AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE A FIRE, CREATING A RISK TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY.\" THIS DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN MY 2003 CRV, YET HONDA HAS REFUSED TO INCLUDE MY VEHICLE STATING THAT IT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL.    ON JUNE 28, 2013 HONDA ANNOUNCED AN IDENTICAL RECALL---THIS TIME FOR THE MASTER POWER WINDOW SWITCH IN THE 2007-08 HONDA FIT.

I WOULD LIKE THE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THESE DANGEROUS, RECURRING INCIDENTS IN HONDA VEHICLES AND EXPAND THE RECALL OF THE CRVS.

I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO INCREASE POWER, AND THE PEDAL SUDDENLY WENT RIGHT TO THE FLOOR AND THE ENGINE RPMS INCREASED FROM 3K TO ABOUT 5.5K.  THE CRV ACCELERATED RAPIDLY, APPROACHING 80 MPH, AND I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE PEDAL. THE ENGINE WAS COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE, AND THE CRV CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE TO 85 MPH.  AT THIS POINT, I MADE SURE THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS TURNED OFF.  I QUICKLY REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG, SO I BEGAN TO APPLY THE BRAKES, GENTLY AT FIRST, BUT THE ENGINE WAS RACING AND ACCELERATING THE CRV, SO I HAD TO SMASH ON THE BRAKE WITH BOTH FEET.  I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE CRV DOWN TO ABOUT 45 MPH AND EXIT THE INTERSTATE AT A REST AREA.  ONCE ON THE OFF-RAMP, I PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL BECAUSE THE BRAKES WERE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS. THE ENGINE RPMS SHOT EVEN HIGHER, SO I CUT THE IGNITION AND COASTED INTO THE REST AREA. WE HAD TO CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK. A MECHANIC CONFIRMED (AS I SUSPECTED) THAT THE BUTTERFLY VALVE IN THE ENGINE THROTTLE BODY WAS STUCK IN THE OPEN POSITION. A FEW DAYS LATER, A HONDA PARTS INSPECTOR REVIEWED THE CRV AND DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, AND THAT WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR A NEW THROTTLE BODY. A SERIES OF CALLS WITH CORPORATE HONDA ENSUED, WHEREIN THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECTIVE PART. AFTER MUCH COMPLAINING ON MY PART, HONDA AGREED TO PAY FOR A NEW THROTTLE AS LONG AS I WOULD SIGN A WAIVER ABSOLVING THEM OF ALL FUTURE LEGAL LIABILITY. I REFUSED TO DO SO. ULTIMATELY, I WORKED WITH MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO TRADE-IN THE CRV FOR A NEWER MODEL.  I DO NOT KNOW THE FATE OF THE 2003 CRV. THE INCIDENT ON THE ROAD WAS HORRIFYING, AND THEN TO BE TREATED POORLY BY CORPORATE HONDA WAS INFURIATING. THE NATIONAL SAFETY DATABASE SHOWS THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE COST FOR A NEW PART WAS $659.95, LABOR AN ADDITIONAL $100.00, WHICH MEANT A BILL CLOSE TO $800.00 WITH TAX. FAR BEYOND MY RETIREMENT INCOME TO HANDLE. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THIS IS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE, SIMILAR TO A SEAT BELT PROBLEM (WHICH HONDA WOULD TAKE CARE OF FOR FREE). THIS SRS CONTROL UNIT RARELY FAILS, THEY TOLD ME. IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT DUE TO MY NEGLIGENCE OR LACK OF ATTENTION TO PROPER MAINTENANCE. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT SINCE THIS IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE, AND WAS NOT CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE BY THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE, THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY HONDA.

DUE TO A PARTS SHORTAGE IT WAS SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED. IN SPRING OF 2004 I REPLACED A HEADLAMP THAT HAD QUIT BURNING ON LOW BEAM SETTING. THE OPPOSITE BULB STOPPED WORKING A FEW DAYS LATER AND WAS REPLACED. ABOUT 4 MONTHS AFTER REPLACING THE FIRST BULB ANOTHER I EXPERIENCED ANOTHER BULB FAILURE ON LOW BEAM SETTING. I REPLACED BOTH HEAD LAMP BULBS AND WENT ANOTHER 4 MONTHS OR SO BEFORE EXPERIENCING ANOTHER FAILURE. SINCE THIS PROBLEM BEGAN I HAVE REPLACED AN AVERAGE OF 8 HEADLAMPS (4 SETS)PER YEAR. WHEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE WITH THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT A WIRE MAY HAVE BEEN PINCHED DURING THE   COLLISION. DURING THE INITIAL DISCUSSION OF THIS PROBLEM I TENDED TO AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE COST PROHIBITIVE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. APPROXIMATELY 4 WEEKS AGO I REPLACED BOTH HEADLAMPS IN THE CR-V. ON 9/02/11 I NOTICED A STRONG BURNING ODOR WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. THE ODOR LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. LATER THAT DAY MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER DROVE THE CR-V. UPON THEIR RETURN HOME I WAS INFORMED THAT THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING  REQUIRING THEM TO DRIVE HOME USING THE HIGH BEAM LAMPS. PREVIOUSLY THAT DAY I HAD PARKED THE VEHICLE IN A DECK AND KNEW THAT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME BOTH LAMPS WERE FUNCTIONING ON LOW SETTING. I WENT TO REPLACE BOTH LAMPS TODAY BUT NEITHER REPLACEMENT WOULD BURN ON A LOW SETTING. FURTHER RESEARCH VIA INTERNET LED ME TO THE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS PROBLEM.

THIS PART NEEDS A RECALL! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO COMPLAIN BEFORE THERE IS A FORMAL RECALL? *JB",
