I called and made another appointment that same day after I saw it was still doing the same  thing. Well the next night I took it on a trip to the next town that was about 20 minutes away. It started \u201cdriving\u201d very strangely and I began to smell a hot or chemical kind of smell. I actually pulled off to the side of the highway at one point. I was able to make it home and didn\u2019t attempt to drive very far until I had it looked at again. We\u2019ll I took it back today and  they\u2019re now telling me it has to have either a new transmission or that one rebuild. Whichever Ford decides. Luckily it\u2019s still under warranty or I\u2019d have a bigger problem. After researching I\u2019ve discovered thousands of other people who have had the exact same issue with their 2020 Explorer, all at different mileages. I feel Ford should have already issued a recall for this known problem by now. This is absolutely a safety issue because if your in traffic or pull out into an intersection and the car doesn\u2019t want to shift it could cause a serious wreck. I\u2019ve already had to have the backup camera replaced(before they issued the recall)and the drivers side power window motor replaced. Definitely regret buying.",

        "summary": "I own a 2020 Ford Explorer (Platinum edition).  A recall was issued for the back-up camera.  My car had been having issues of intermittent camera problems prior to the recall.  I took my car into Sam Pack's Five Star Ford of Lewisville (1144 N Stemmons Fwy, Lewisville, TX 75067) for the recall repair.  .  .      I drove the vehicle for about thirty minutes after completion of the recall repair at which time I parked the car.  Unfortunately, when I did so the \"Blue Screen\" returned.  The was the reason for the recall.  .  .      This is the same as prior to the recall \"repair\".  Also, when this happens a warning pops up \"Reverse Brake Assist Not Available\" (this may be because the camera is malfunctioning).    The camera does not do this all of the time.  There is no rhyme or reason as to when it is going to fail.  After turning the car off for a while (as when eating at a restaurant or grocery shopping, etc.) the camera works when you put the car into reverse (with the one exception noted above).  It appears that the \"fix\" for the recall is insufficient to stop the camera errors from recurring.   The incident date listed below is the date of the supposed recall repair.   I have uploaded a PDF File showing pictures of the camera errors.  If you would like any other information, or pictures of the blue screen errors, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I can be reached by email at [XXX] or by phone at [XXX].   INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

A Google search suggested there was a problem with the back up camera for 2020 Explorer, but there was no recall on my VIN.  After reaching out to Ford soon after we got the car back, a service person offered to order a new camera, but it was never approved. Numerous calls were placed to the dealership given ongoing camera failure and concern for causing an accident, but we were told that the problem needed to be reproduced.  The camera could not be ordered.  While backing the car out of our driveway without an operational camera or sensors, driver side rear bumper collided with a car parked in the street. The insurance company was notified the day of the accident and the car was taken to Ford body shop 9/21 where a repair estimate was provided. The dealership service department was notified that the car was involved in an accident because of camera failure and finally agreed to order a new replacement camera. On 9/23, we were notified of a \"blue screen\" back up camera recall.",

Ford requested that I bring in my truck and changed the camera. They found out the camera had an electrical shortage. I attempted to get Forx to pay for the damages to my vehicle and they refused. The total estimate was 2700.00. The response why they denied my claim was I had an accident and they were not responsible regardless of the camera not working. They told me to contact my insurance to fix the damage. I feel I wouldn't have had an accident if my rearview camera did not go out.  The backup assistance beep would have sensed the object behind me in my backup  view and I would not have damaged my vehicle since the object was in my blind spot. I feel that Ford is responsible for the repairs and I have Video proof that my camera was having issues prior to my accident. I need Ford to fix my vehicle at no cost to me.

Both vehicles since we obtained them in October of 2020 have experienced loss of power. Both vehicles dash indicators lights come on and the vehicles has a complete system failure. In June of this year an officer was responding to an emergency call. The officer was traveling at approximately 50 mph. The vehicle's dash lights all came on and the vehicle's power system shut down. The officer stated the vehicle almost came to a dead stop, almost causing him to crash. He stated if he was not wearing his seat belt he would have went through the windshield. This particular vehicle has had had complete loss of power approximately eight times. Ford has replaced the ECM power module stating this would fix the issue. Now the vehicle's trailer module has supposedly failed and caused a complete loss of power. This trailer module effected the entire electrical system. This vehicle has been unusable since July 19. Prior to this latest incident the vehicle was unusable for approximately four weeks. In the almost year we have had the vehicle in service it has been unusable approximately 6 to 7 weeks. I have contacted Brooklyn Center, MN PD, East Grand Forks, ND PD and Yankton, SD PD. These agencies all have had the same Ford Hybrids. They all have experienced the same issues. Yankton PD is currently had one vehicle labeled a lemon and Ford is replacing this vehicle. Our agency is attempting to have Ford recognize this issue. We want the two vehicles replaced and be deemed unusable. I am contacting the NTSB to assist our police agency in addressing this issue. We cannot provide sufficient public service to our community with these vehicles. If we cannot respond to emergencies in a timely manner due to these vehicles not properly functioning then the potential for the public's safety is potentially at risk. Not to mention the safety of our officers. Thank you.",

I then push down even harder on brakes.   I am fighting to keep the Explorer from roaring out of the garage.  Luckily I haven't hit anyone or anything, but had I not reacted as quickly I could easily have caused serious injury.   I reported this problem to my local dealer two times, the first about 10 months ago and the second incident was reported to the dealer when I took it in in August 2021 for numerous alerts received in July 2021 for: POWERTRAIN MALFUNCTION/ REDUCED POWER; PRE-COLLISION ASSIST NOT AVAILABLE; HILL START ASSIST WARNING, PRE-COLLISION ASSIST NOT AVAILABLE.  The dealer said all the alerts came from one power module which will be fixed this week when the part arrives at the dealer.  The dealer also said that the recent Reverse power surge I advised them of is probably related to all of the alerts listed above and that this should take care of the problem.

After a week of being at the dealership, they couldn't find anything; however, 30 seconds after I got into my vehicle, I noticed the cabin lights weren't working. After returning the vehicle within an hour they found that a wire had burned out and shorted out some fuses. 2 weeks later and I still don't have my vehicle. No injuries, just scared beyond belief to have a 2020 ST start smoking!! Even if they state it is fixed, I am still scared to death to drive it after that!!  I have had issues with the brakes as well. Those stopped working but apparently that was a recall that was resolved. I have purchased Fords for the past 20 years.

        "summary": "There are times when I start the vehicle, or manually release the parking brake, that it simply does not release.  The brake pedal becomes rock hard at these times, without its normal travel.  If the vehicle is reversing, like leaving my garage, it stops like it hit a brick wall when the brake pedal is touched.  The rear brakes are simply locked.  It stops so abruptly that it has aggravated lower back pain from previous injuries.  I\u2019m afraid of getting stranded in traffic, unable to move the vehicle.  It did this on dirt and it was just dragging the rear tires. The only solution I have found is to turn off the engine, wait a few seconds, restart the vehicle, hope.  I got, in rapid succession:  1.  ANTILOCK BRAKE FAULT !!! 2.  HILL DESCENT CONTROL FAULT 3.  PRE-COLLISION ASSIST NOT AVAILABLE 4.  HILL START ASSIST WARNING  The service at Mesquite (Nevada) Ford was totally insufficient.  I expected them to find and fix the problem, which obviously lies in the anti-lock/parking brake.  I was eager to get the vehicle back and find out what was wrong as I\u2019ve been afraid to use the manual parking brake for fear it will seize up and not release.  When I got the vehicle back (which took a long time and a long story as the mechanic went home sick in the middle of the job with COVID) they said, \u201cOh, we reset the error message so everything is fine.\u201d  Well, it still locks up, sometimes when I have shut the engine off and sometimes when I tried to manually set the parking brake, which I am still avoiding.  If it\u2019s only my vehicle then there is a dealer problem.  If there are more reports, then it\u2019s a bigger problem.  I don\u2019t know where on your site to say this \u2014 I am shocked by the number of fatalities \u2014 but not really.  Either reduce the speed limits in the west or keep killing people.  80 mph is ridiculous because everyone now runs 90+ mph.  We\u2019ve come upon two fatal accidents this summer on I-15.  The carnage was terrible.  Please, please, please slow the traffic.",

THE ICON ON THE DASH (SSR) READ 85 MPH WHICH IS 20 MPH OVER THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT. THE SECOND TIME WHEN THE CAR SPED UP, IT SLOWED ABRUPTLY DUE TO A CAR CROSSING IN FRONT OF ME (WITHIN THE 4 CAR FOLLOWING GAP SETTING).

THIS ALSO HAPPENS IN REVERSE.  THE CAR WILL NOT LET ME REVERSE OUT OF MY GARAGE - NOTHING IS ANYWHERE NEAR IT!!!  I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND RESTART IT TO CLEAR ITS SENSORS. NOTHING IS THERE!!!  I HAVE HAD THE CAR ABOUT 7 MONTHS AND ONLY HAVE ABOUT 2000 MILES ON THE CAR.  I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AND WANT TO RETURN IT.  THE SENSORS ARE OBVIOUSLY MALFUNCTIONING.      THE VEHICLE WILL NOT REMEMBER SEAT SETTINGS OR MIRROR SETTINGS.  IT ALSO INADVERTENTLY CHANGES THE SEAT LOCATION WHILE GOING FROM PARK TO DRIVE OR SITTING AT A LIGHT AND PUSHES IT ALL THE WAY FORWARD RAMMING MY KNEES/LEGS INTO THE DASH....

THE VEHICLE LOST ALL POWER AND CONTROL AND HAD THIS HAPPENED ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY DOING 80 MILES PER HOUR THE RESULT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC AND POTENTIALLY FATAL.    IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE AND I AM BEING TOLD IT NEEDS A NEW ENGINE BUT FORD CANNOT PROVIDE A DATE WHEN THE ENGINE WILL BE AVAILABLE. REMEMBER....THIS VEHICLE WAS ONLY A MONTH OLD! A 2020 VEHICLE BROKE DOWN IN 2019!!!    THE DEALERSHIP IS BEING FANTASTIC AND TRYING TO SWAP THE VEHICLE OUT FOR ME BUT FORD HAS DENIED THEIR REQUEST. I FINALLY SPOKE WITH A FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ([XXX]) AND SHE TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINES FOR THIS MODEL (YES ENGINES PLURAL!) ARE BEING SHIPPED AT THE END OF THE MONTH. I ASKED HER DIRECTLY IF I WAS THE ONLY ONE EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE AND SHE FLAT OUT SAID \"NO, YOU'RE NOT\".
