The contact stated that she refilled the oil when she arrived at her residence. The contact noticed that the vehicle was consuming an excessive amount of oil and she was refilling the oil each 4-6 weeks. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, Bobby Rahal of the South Hills, who diagnosed that the piston rings needed to be replaced for more than $4,000 or the dealer stated that adding oil to the car every month would be a cheaper and not unsafe solution. On January 1 while driving on the highway, far from home, in the rain and fog with 3 children in the car, the engine started riding rough. The vehicle was driven cautiously home and taken to the independent mechanic specializing in Volvos who diagnosed that the engine had failed and needed to be replaced. The independent mechanic said he has seen 4-5 Volvos this year with the same problem, and that there is something wrong with the 2015 2/5 engine for this car, but prior to that year, it has been a good engine, and since that year, it has been a good engine. The vehicle was towed to the dealer where it was purchased, Bobby Rahal Volvo of the North Hills, and the diagnosis was the same for the 6 year old car needing a new engine for more than $16,000. Since the car was purchased in November 2020 for $18K+, the customer is wondering if the dealer that sold the car and the dealer that was asked about the oil issue knew the car engine was likely defective, did not tell the contact and put the contact's family in an unsafe situation. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, and the contact is awaiting a response. The vehicle has not yet been repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 76,000, after less than 8,000 of vehicle ownership.\"",

        "summary": "ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2016, AT 10:00 A.M., I PUT MY CAR IN PARK ON MY DRIVEWAY.  MY CAR WAS STATIONARY ON MY DRIVEWAY WHEN I EXITED IT AND WENT INTO MY GARAGE. WHEN I TURNED AROUND, MY UNOCCUPIED CAR WAS COMING TOWARD ME FROM THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE GARAGE.  I WAS UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE CAR AND ENDED UP PINNED BETWEEN THE LEFT WALL OF MY GARAGE, A RECYCLE CAN, AND THE CAR.  FORTUNATELY, THE CAR WAS ROLLING INTO THE GARAGE IN A STRAIGHT LINE, WHICH LEFT JUST ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN MY BODY, THE CAR, AND THE WALL; OTHERWISE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUSHED AND KILLED.  A LARGE RECYCLE TRASH CAN AND A LADDER STOPPED THE CAR BEFORE IT CONTINUED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE REAR GARAGE WALL AND INTO MY FAMILY ROOM WHERE MY DISABLED HUSBAND WAS SITTING.  A WORKMAN ON MY PROPERTY, WHO WITNESSED THE ENTIRE EVENT, HELPED ME GET OUT OF THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL AND CAR AND REMOVED THE CAR FROM THE GARAGE.  I MUST HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF SHOCK FROM THE ACCIDENT BECAUSE I CANNOT REMEMBER SOME DETAILS AND MUST HAVE BEEN HIT BY THE CAR BECAUSE I STILL HAVE DAMAGE TO MY LEFT LEG AND PAIN IN MY LOWER BODY; ALSO, THE CAR HAD DAMAGE TO ITS LEFT FENDER.   I VISITED MY DOCTOR REGARDING THE INJURY TO MY LEFT LEG AND THE PAIN TO THE LOWER PART OF MY BODY.  MY HUSBAND NOTIFIED VOLVO ABOUT THE INCIDENT.  THE COMPANY HAD THE CAR TOWED TO ITS FACILITY WHERE IT WAS RUN THROUGH A BATTERY OF TESTS.  EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY CLAIMS THAT IT FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INCIDENT, I THINK THAT IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT IN CASE IT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE FUTURE.   MY UNOCCUPIED CAR MOVED FORWARD FROM A STATIONARY, PARKED POSITION.  I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXIT MY CAR IF IT WERE PLACED IN ANY OTHER GEAR THAN PARK.",
