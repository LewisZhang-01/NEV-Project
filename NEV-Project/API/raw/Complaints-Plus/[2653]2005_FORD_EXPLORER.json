THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED TO BRING ATTENTION TO FORD FOR THIS PROBLEM, THEY BLEW US OFF, NOT EVEN HAVING THE COURTESY TO GET OUR LETTER TO THE PERSON IT WAS ADDRESSED. AS HUMAN NATURE, FORD TRIED TO MANIPULATE THE PROBLEM, AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION ACTUALLY CONVINCING THEMSELVES AND TRYING TO CONVINCE ME THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.      WE LIKE TO KEEP ALL OUR STUFF NICE BUT CURRENTLY OUR VEHICLE DOESN?T LOOK NICE. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO THROW AWAY OUR MONEY ON A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. AGAIN, IT IS DEFECTIVE, ANYONE RELATED TO THE VEHICLE INDUSTRY AND BODYWORK, WITH ANY SENSE, CAN REALIZE THE PROBLEM.    ON OUR FIRST ATTEMPT TO PROPOSE FORD?S RESOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM WE DIDN?T DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM. THIS TIME WE?RE READY TO GO AT IT IN FULL FORCE (ATTORNEY GENERAL, BBB, LOCAL & NATIONAL NEWS OUTLETS, AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION) IF FORD DOESN?T FIND A FAIR WAY TO COMPENSATE US. THE ISSUE BEING  THE FIRST PANEL BEING DEFECTIVE AND CRACKED ALLOWING US TO DRIVE AROUND IN A JUNKY LOOKING VEHICLE; REPLACING THE PRODUCT FOR $500 WHICH STILL HAD THE ISSUE AND ONCE AGAIN WE?RE DRIVING AROUND WITH A JUNKY LOOKING VEHICLE; RESALE VALUE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

IN DOING SO, THE GEARSHIFT ALMOST COMPLETELY BROKE AWAY FROM THE STEERING COLUMN.  I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF, BUT WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.    AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE GEARSHIFT IS NOT A SERVICEABLE PART AND THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS ISSUE BEFORE, IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE COST FOR A NEW STEERING COLUMN AND ASSOCIATED LABOR WOULD BE MORE THAN $1,600.  SHE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT A USED STEERING COLUMN FROM A JUNKYARD WOULD COST MUCH LESS, BUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE EXACT AMOUNT UNTIL EARLY MONDAY MORNING.  ON MONDAY MORNING, I WAS INFORMED BY KRF SOUTH THAT THEY COULD OBTAIN A USED STEERING COLUMN AND THE TOTAL COSTS FOR PARTS AND LABOR WOULD BE $620.  I CHOSE TO HAVE THE USED USED STEERING COLUMN INSTALLED DUE TO THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL.    SIMPLY PUT, A GEARSHIFT SHOULD NOT BREAK OFF FROM THE STEERING COLUMN THROUGH NORMAL VEHICLE USE.

        "summary": "I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON MY 2005 FORD EXPLORER. MY SON FIRST DISCOVERED IT BACK IN JULY-AUGUST 2010. WHILE HE WAS ADJUSTING HIS SPEED FOR THE CRUISE CONTROL WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR COMPLETELY STALLED OUT AND HE LOST ALL POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. THANK GOODNESS, HE HAD THE PEACE OF MIND TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND TURN THE KEY TO START IT AGAIN. I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT TO DO THAT WHILE TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED TRYING TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE WITHOUT POWER BRAKES OR STEERING. SINCE THAT INITIAL EPISODE, BOTH MY SON AND MY HUSBAND HAVE TESTED IT AT SLOWER SPEEDS AND HAVE HAD THE SAME RESULTS. SO WE BROUGHT IT TO A FORD DEALER IN OUR AREA TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. THEY EVENTUALLY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BOX AND THAT IT WOULD COST IN THE RANGE OF $800-850 TO FIX. I ASKED THE DEALER IF THERE WAS A RECALL REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND HE SAID THERE WASN'T. I QUESTIONED  WHY THERE WASN'T SINCE THIS WAS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE, STALLING AT HIGH SPEEDS. I REALIZE IT IS ONLY WHEN I USE THE CRUISE CONTROL BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE SAFETY CONCERN. HE ASSURED ME THAT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN IF THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS NOT USED. SO I OPTED TO CONTACT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO. $800-850 IS A LOT OF MONEY. I GOT FEEDBACK ON THE ISSUE A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THAT BASICALLY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL SO THEY COULDN'T HELP ME. THEN I WAS ASKED TO FILL OUT A CUSTOMER SERVICE SURVEY WHERE I REITERATED THAT MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUE WERE NOT ANSWERED. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN A RESPONSE FROM THEM AND THAT WAS BACK ON 8-10-10. SO I AM NOW WRITING TO YOU. JUST HOW DOES A SAFETY RECALL GET STARTED? ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM? *TR",

LATELY THE TRANSMISSION HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING GOOD SO WE TOOK IT TO OUR MECHANIC, WHO TELLS US IT IS A \"TICKING TIME BOMB\" AND NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION ASAP. THE CAR CURRENTLY HAS 48953 MI ON IT.

IT STARTED RANDOMLY DYING ON ME LIKE THE OTHERS I HAVE READ ABOUT (70+ ON THE INTERSTATE WAS THE MOST INTERESTING!) THIS VEHICLE DOESN'T HAVE A CABLE FROM THE GAS PEDAL TO THE THROTTLE; THE COMPUTER TAKES THE REQUEST FROM THE PEDAL AND THEN THE COMPUTER OPENS THE THROTTLE. SO, IF THE COMPUTER CAN'T \"SEE\" WHAT THE THROTTLE IS ACTUALLY DOING, THAT COULD BE A BAD THING, AND FOR SAFETY REASONS, SHUTS EVERYTHING DOWN (FORD'S SO CALLED FMEM \"LIMP HOME MODE\").    WELL, I REPLACED THE TPS, AND IT STARTED AGAIN. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, AND IN RETURN FOR 90 DOLLARS, THEY PLUGGED A BOX INTO MY SUV, PUSHED A BUTTON AND THEN TOLD ME THE PCM WAS BAD.    THE PCM (POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE) IS THE MAIN BRAIN FOR THE CAR. EVERYTHING IS EITHER DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY IT, OR BY A SUBMODULE (SRS, 4WD, ABS, EATC, INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, TPMS, AND VCM) THAT IT DIRECTLY CONTROLS.    HERE IS THE RUB: CONSIDER PEOPLE THAT LOSE A LIMB, BUT CONTINUE TO FEEL ITS' PRESENCE. THAT'S' BECAUSE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF REAL TIME DATA FROM THE LIMB, THE BRAIN HAS A PROBLEM AND 'THINKS' IT SEES THE LIMB.    IN CASE THE ANALOGY ISN'T CLEAR, IF THE PCM BEGINS TO FAIL, IT MIGHT SAY *ANY* SENSOR IS FAILING. BUT THE SENSOR IS FINE ' THE BRAIN IS 'BROKEN'. IF IT IS BROKEN DUE TO A HEAT OR VIBRATION ISSUE, IT CAN WORK PERFECTLY FOR HOWEVER LONG, THEN JUST GO NUTS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.    THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST ' THIS PCM CONTROLS EVERYTHING, RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENS IF IT COMMANDS THE THROTTLE TO WIDE OPEN, COMMANDS THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT TO 1ST, THEN FIRES THE AIRBAGS? CAN YOU PROVE IT COULDN'T?     MY PROBLEM IN A NUTSHELL IS THAT AN EMISSIONS CONTROL ITEM LIKE THE PCM SHOULDN'T FAIL IN THREE YEARS. FORD SHOULD JUST FIX IT INSTEAD OF CHARGING A GRAND PLUS LABOR. ALL OF THESE OTHERS HAVING INTERMITTENT SURGING, STALLING FAILSAFE MODE AND THROTTLE ISSUES I AM BETTING IS THE SAME PROBLEM.  *TR",

IT WAS CONSIDERED \"NEW\" BECAUSE IT HAD UNDER 6,500 MILES (IT WAS THEIR DEMO CAR.) 5000 INTO MY NEW PURCHASE, AT APPROXIMATELY 11,000 MILES, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. THE VEHICLE DRIFTED BACK WHILE IN GEAR AND WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO GEAR SMOOTHLY. I TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIR AS A TRANSMISSION COMPLAINT. 8,000 MILES LATER (AT APPROXIMATELY 19,000 MILES), I WAS HAVING MORE DIFFICULTY WITH A SLIPPING TRANSMISSION AND TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER IN MY AREA. THEY FOUND A LEAK WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION AND FOUND OTHER TRANSMISSION ISSUES. AT APPROXIMATELY 49,000 MILES (CURRENT MILEAGE), I WAS AGAIN EXPERIENCING TRANSMISSION SLIPS AND A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR. I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER WHO SAID THE REAR NEEDED REPLACEMENT AND BASICALLY THE ENTIRE BACK END WAS FALLING APART. I COULD FEEL THIS WAS ALSO RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION. I, AGAIN, TOOK IT IN FOR THE 3RD TIME AS A TRANSMISSION COMPLAINT. THE DEALER CALLED ME AND TOLD ME MY CAR WAS REPAIRED, BUT APPARENTLY, THEY ONLY FIXED WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE REAR. I PAID $1500 TO FIX THE REAR. I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE AND I NOTICED THE CAR WAS NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY AND IT WAS MORE OBVIOUS THAN BEFORE. I LIVE ONLY 6 BLOCKS AWAY. I DROVE IT HOME AND PARKED THE CAR. THAT MORNING, I COULD BARELY GET MY CAR TO GO INTO GEAR. IT WOULD NOT EVEN GO INTO REVERSE. IT WOULDN'T MOVE. I EVENTUALLY GOT IT TO GO INTO DRIVE AND WAS JUST BARELY ABLE TO RETURN IT TO THE DEALER, WHICH, FORTUNATELY, WAS JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. THE CAR CLEARLY HAD A BAD TRANSMISSION FROM THE START. NOW, THE DEALER TELLS ME I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION WHICH WILL COST ME $3500. I HAVE ALWAYS CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000-5,000 MILES. I TREAT THE CAR LIKE MY BABY - IT WAS WELL TAKEN CARE OF. I HAVE NEVER BEEN HARD ON THIS VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THE BACK END TROUBLE IS RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION, AS WELL.  *TR",
