They performed the recall items, and the car ran better, but I could still hear the knocking.  February 7, 2022, my daughter and I were stranded because the car was not accelerating again.  Pulled over to an Advanced Auto Parts store and the technician said there was a problem with the gaskets, but said he wouldn't drive it. Had my car taken back to Hall Hyundai and was told there wasn't any oil on the dipstick, but they had changed the oil a month before.  Had an engine combustion cleaning done.  Picked my vehicle up the next day and before I got home, the check engine light was back on, and the engine knocking.  I no longer drive my car because my daughter is scared in it, and I have lost confidence that we aren't going to end up on the side of the road somewhere.  The engine jumps as if the car is going to either take off or shut down completely.  Asked the representative at Hall if I should bring the car back, but never received a response. The car and it has less than 100K miles on it. I've done the required maintenance. I like Hyundai cars, but will most likely switch brands because I can't get any help to repair a vehicle I've had for less than two years.

        "summary": "On September 20th, 2021, I was on my way to my appointment with Maguire Hyundai in Ithaca, NY when the engine in my 2017 Hyundai Tucson failed. I ended up having to get my car towed to the dealership at my own expense. I made the appointment originally because my car had been making strange noises for 1-2 weeks and the check engine light had come on. At this time, there was not yet a recall for this engine failure in 2017 Tucsons (or at least I had not been notified of one yet and the dealership said nothing about it). According to your website, the recall campaign for the exact issue/situation with my car began September 17th, 2021, and since having my car towed to the dealership I have received multiple notices about the recall. Maguire Hyundai has had my car since September 20th, and the engine has still not been replaced. They tested the engine and found that it was punctured and needed to be replaced. They claimed they had to contact the warranty folks to get approval that it would be covered, which I don't understand because if there's a recall it should be replaced at no charge. Once they got that approval, they said it could take awhile for the engine to get here and for them to actually work on the car. I received a call on 1/27/22 that they finally put the new engine into my car, but the engine does not work/they were sent a bad engine. It has been over 4 months now that they've had my car and we have gotten nowhere. I am skeptical about what this dealership is telling me and if they know what they are doing/have really been doing their best to get my car taken care of. I feel that my car not being finished after 4 months is absurd and I am seeking any assistance possible with this matter.",

There weren't any signs of issues but abruptly stopped.  We had the car towed to Shottenkirk Hyundai. We were told the car needed a new motor. Hyundai corporate said they would split the cost of a goodwill motor with us, but we would have to wait until November for it to come in.  Our cost was $4500. We agreed. Then we were called and told sorry you need a Catalytic Converter also additional $600. We agreed, as I was pregnant and just wanted my car back.  In December, we were told sorry but your wiring harness is bad and that's what made the motor fail. So that will be an additional $4500. At which point we were in the hospital having our newborn.  We told them not to do anything else as we weren't going to spend $10K on this vehicle.  We are at our wits end with this car and dealing with the dealership and the corporate office and don't know what else to do.

My vehicle has had significant oil consumption issues for the last 1.5 years, causing me to have to put oil in the car regularly between oil changes, irregular engine noise, oil pressure light illumination as well as engine hesitation and stalling. Each of these things are related to the symptoms cited as an engine issue related to recall 209. There is no remedy available for this issue and no timeline for when one will be released. It is extremely concerning to be driving a vehicle with an engine that may catch fire and I have had zero success in gaining more information from my local dealership or Hyundai Customer Care Center.",

        "summary": "Purchased my 2017 Hyundai Tucson 1.6 Turbo SUV in mid-July 2021 from CarMAX. Brought it into their service department because it seemed like the battery was dying due to the car not wanting to start/turn over, or turning over veeeerrrry slowly, while holding down the push-button start. CarMAX replaced the battery and checked over the acceleration issues I also reported. At that time (July), the vehicle had also randomly opened it's trunk, with no outside communication to do so. At first I thought it was a fluke, but it's been happening so often lately (now October 2021) that now my husband is constantly checking to make sure the trunk is closed-because the key fobs will be hanging up/away from people/out of pockets but the trunk will still open randomly. TODAY, 25OCT2021, I got a phone call from my husband while I'm at work-telling me that while he was driving our son to work, the trunk decided to RANDOMLY OPEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, spilling all the contents of my trunk out onto the highway!! This is clearly some kind of electrical issue, that I see other Hyundai owners have been experiencing since AT LEAST 2011-and not all Tucsons, either! When calling around to various mechanics (because the car is, of course, out of warranty), its going to be at least $150 to diagnose the problem (not including FIXING it), and I have to either sit and wait all day for the fix to be done (IF it can be fixed same day!) and be without my only vehicle. This seems to be a recurring issue with Hyundai vehicles, which is quite sad, because I've owned Hyundais before and they were WONDERFUL cars. I would hate to have reached the end of my relationship with Hyundai after seeing all the ELECTRICAL issues that seem to be popping up everywhere, causing fires, causing people's cars to randomly STOP and/or TURN OFF in traffic (have had that happen also, with a Toyota), vehicle FIRES, lights burning so hot they melt their housings, etc. THESE ARE *ALL* ELECTRICAL/WIRING HARNESS RELATED!",

I recently received notice that Hyundai has issued a warranty extension for the door latch on this model, so it's a known issue that's obviously quite common.  It seems to me that a widespread door latch malfunction is a safety issue that would be better addressed with a recall.  I appreciate that my current problem will be covered under warranty.  But stories shared online from other owners would lead me to believe that my other doors are likely to fail as well, and the extended warranty is only good until 100,000 miles.  That may sound generous, but if they know their door latch is faulty, they should be required to replace all 4 doors with a latch that's not likely to fail.",

I immediately brought the vehicle to my local dealership and they seemed completely mystified by the problem. They advised that I run the car through an expensive oil consumption diagnostic test. I did not, opting instead to do some research myself. Lo and behold, I quickly discovered that both Hyundai corporate and local franchisees have been well aware of the issue for some time. It involves connecting rod bearing failure. A class action suit was filed over the issue in California federal court and Hyundai corporate agreed to fix the problem through a voluntary settlement. Unfortunately, that settlement only covered Tucson models before and after my model year. If you wish to learn more about this issue, it has its own website (HyundaiThetaEngine Settlement.com).  To further complicate matters, Hyundai corporate has in the interim issued a voluntary recall for my model year 2017. Unfortunately, it appears my specific model may be excluded.

I believe you doing this because of the 100 emails i sent complaining about it and the 20 times i took my suv to the shop for it and they could not fix it. I contacted the dealership and they told me there is no recall and they cant help me. When i take off my SUV will stall in middle of intersection which they though it was the Duel Clutch and now you figured it was the engine. How can we get this fixed or add my VIN to the recall list. Recall ID # is 21V727.  Thanks",

For some reason, my car frequently hesitates when I go from a complete stop/slow roll to accelerate. For example, if I am stopped waiting to turn, often when I push the gas to accelerate, the car will begin to accelerate and then basically stop. When this has happened, I've pushed my foot down to the floor on the pedal before to make it go and it refused to go for about 20 or so seconds. Additionally, if I am in slow moving traffic and traffic begins to speed up, my car will hesitate to go forward when I try to accelerate. This is a huge safety concern. The mechanic was not able to replicate this issue, but it happens every day or every other day. It makes me scared to drive because it's almost caused accidents.

September 17, 2021 I was Driving and my vehicle failed to accelerate and began making noises that resembled the oil issue. My car had a full synthetic oil change less than 3k miles ago and by the time I pulled Into my driveway the car stalled.   Checked oil and it was low. Added 3 quarts of oil on 9/17/21 and left it to sit. 9/18/21 car started and was driven to car wash and was sitting idle for approximately 45 minutes and on drive home, stalled and had to have oil added again. No leaks were present at anytime and no smoke.  Went to dealership where I purchased vehicle and was told they would need to do oil consumption test but that would require me driving it 1k miles up to three times. I explained that my vehicle was breaking down and I was Fearful to drive it. In fact I bought A new car on 9/18/21 and have to get this car fixed to sell. Dealership said this is a known problem and no other way to assess than for me to drive the car the 1k miles and test it.   It is still under warranty. I  was also informed of an ABS issue that they can fix at same time. While all of these issues are going on, no check engine light or any other diagnostic symbol appears. This makes it hard to even catch before getting to the point of stalled engine. This can be a danger to myself, family and others when car stalls on major highway.",

As I approached the airport, an additional large red triangle illuminated in the center of the dashboard saying \"check ----\" (4 letters, I don't remember what they were). I stopped to get my parking ticket, and the car rolled backward as I tried to begin moving. I gunned the engine, and was able to get to a parking spot, but felt the car had very little power. On my return approximately 36 hours later the oil light was still on; so it was towed to the nearest Hyundai dealer. The tow truck driver commented on it having low power as he tried to drive it onto the tow truck ramp. This Hyundai dealer was unable to find anything wrong. I drove it to the dealer from whom I had bought the car; they tried to recreate the situation where this occurred, and said they were unable to do so. I am concerned as this problem has not been diagnosed or repaired, and did cause a partial loss of power, which could have caused an accident.

The DCT is a major safety concern and a common reported issue. Why aren'tyou doing anything to help consumers?

        "summary": "We bought our 2017 Tucson with about 40000 miles in 2019. We have had some issues that are to be covered by the warranty. The last was the engine going. I was extremely religious about regular maintenance and always took it to the dealership to have the oil changed and other work every 3000. 2 of the last 4 oil changes cost me over $400 and $600 due to what I thought was work required to maintain the warranty, finding out later that this was false and the service people lied. In the last 4 oil changed I reported excessive oil consumption, 1 qt per 1000 miles at least. They told me this was normal and to be expected. I was 4 hours in to a 8 hour drive when the engine failed. I had checked and filled the oil before I left, in 4 hours it consumed over 3qts. It took me at least a month of dealing with the warranty company to cover as we had a lifetime powertrain warranty. They were not going to cover it due to lack of lubricant. As I told them the engine was failing before this incident. The dealer did not record my requests to find the oil consumption problem. It has now been 4 months, still making car payments and waiting for them to put a used engine in it. We were not offered a choice of whether used or rebuild. This is a known problem and have found class action suits for similar vehicles but for whatever reason earlier and later models are included, same engine and same problem as those part of the class action.",

I maintained this car as I should have and got oil changes before the suggested time provided by the dealer. Now fast forward to 2020/2021 and my car is louder, making noises, not driving smoothly, and having trouble accelerating sometimes. I tell the dealer and they say nothing is wrong with my car but these problems persist. Eventually while driving to work early this year (spring 2021) my car completely stalls and will hardly drive faster than 5mph. I took the car to a mechanic (not Hyundai because they never have answers) that told me my catalytic converter was completely clogged and that it was an unusual thing to see in such a new car with only 100,000 miles on it. They replaced the converter and now it doesn\u2019t stall. The car still continues to drive less smooth and the engine knocks and makes rattle noises but Hyundai still says they don\u2019t see any other issue with the car. My mechanic told me it seems as if the car is burning the oil up because even when i come to get an oil change early it\u2019s always bone dry my car is always starting to get super loud and check engine light comes on well before I\u2019m due to change it so i take it up and get an oil change but i believe this is a defect on the car and i shouldn\u2019t have to continue doing this eventually it\u2019s going to cause even worse problems for my car, i read other reviews and I\u2019m not the only one complaining of the oil burning up with no leak or other explanation, clearly this is a manufacturer defect!",

Check oil and it is on low. drop off at dealer they claim nothing is wrong. Force me to pay for another oil change and perform a 500 mile oil consumption test which will involve me driving this car on the highway with an engine that can seize at any moment  potentially killing me or others on the road. Leave dealership and the car continues to spew smoke from tail pipe. No check engine lights appear during either event. This is incredibly dangerous and needs to be added to a lawsuit.

My engine blew up at 70,806 miles while I was on my way to work.My husband was changing the oil and when he pulled the oil plug from the oil pan, NOTHING came out of the pan. We assumed the dealer just didn't put oil back in it or not enough. The mileage on the Tuscon the last time we took it to the dealer was at 54,988. We put a 7,500-mile oil change in it and the next oil change, it was dry again. No oil light, no engine light, no oil spots on the ground or the engine. No evidence of it leaking anywhere. Fast forward a few oil changes, sooner than suggested, we changed the oil at around 68,000 miles with no issues (only because we were changing the oil every 3,500 miles or so). Then while on my way home from work one evening, all my dash lights came on, my car sounded and ran extremely rough for the 15 miles I had until I reached my house. As I pulled up the driveway, you could hear it knocking loudly so I checked my oil and the engine was BONE DRY, it had only been 2,200 miles since the last oil change so it shouldn't have been empty. We added the 5 quarts of oil that it needed and drove it down the road a mile or so to listen and feel it, nothing was wrong; it sounded fine and ran well. The next morning it ran for 15 min in my driveway, warming up, and drove 8 miles and I heard a loud clank. It stalled, I was able to start it back up, it stalled again and I had to coast it half a mile to get it out of the road and into a driveway out of harm's way. It had to be towed to the dealer. They ran several tests to find out that \"cylinder 3 had spun its bearings leaving heavy amounts of metal in the oil and pan noted, premature material failure of bearing is cause of rod knocking. Engine will need replaced due to introduction of metal on all moving components.\" It was in the shop for a month being repaired and now with only 5,222 miles on the engine, I've already had to add almost 4 quarts of oil in 2 months.",

        "summary": "We had a recent onset of issues with our 2017 Tucson Limited Ultimate that is alarming and potentially dangerous. I am most concerned with the safety of my wife and child as this is her primary vehicle.  We have a new issue, relating to the door locks - that I would like to address, but would like to give the recent history or events before I get to that.   We recently addressed a recall relating to a brake module - a potential fire hazard, as well as failed Turbo that caused a sudden loss of power at a critical time. This could have been a potential wreck, but thankfully it was avoided.  Now we are at another safety issue that needs to be addressed with the door locks.  This is concerning, inconvenient, and most likely not covered as a recall as it should be.   Around 6 months ago there was a sudden power loss and whistling sound from the engine compartment.  This happened while entering a turn in a busy intersection, which could have caused an accident.  I took it to the dealer, and the problem was diagnosed as a faulty Turbo Charger and required order and replacement.  Luckily this was covered on the warranty. The problem was resolved.   Then I received a notification of a recall for the Brake Control Module because of the potential of fire in the engine compartment. I scheduled an appointment at my local dealer and had that replaced at no additional cost to me. My local dealership was about to resolve this issue as well.   Today, I went to take my daughter to school and the rear passenger door would not open from the outside or the inside.  The door lock clicks, but we are not able to exit the vehicle from that side or open the door from the outside. Upon researching on the internet, it's a ongoing issue with the door actuator. https://www.hyundai-forums.com/threads/rear-passenger-door-wont-open.603329/ I scheduled an appointment for Monday, but it is again, a safety issue, and this will not be covered and most likely cost me out of pocket.

I PROCEEDED TO GET SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO MY HOME. AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED BLINKING SO I GOT OFF ONTO THE EXIT AND AT THE TOP THE MOTOR MADE A HARD NOISE AND STOPPED AND ALL THE LIGHTS CAME ON THE DASH AND SMOKE CAME FROM UNDER THE CAR. THERE WAS OIL ON THE GROUND SO I ASSUME THE OIL PAN HAD A HOLE FROM A ROD FAILURE. I CHANGE MY OWN OIL EVERY 7500N MILES WHEN THE FACTORY SETTING TELLS ME IT'S TIME. I USE MOBIL 1 SYNTHETIC OIL AND A GOOD FILTER EVERY TIME. I HAD THE OIL CHANGED THE FIRST TIME AT HYUNDAI OF ONTARIO, CALIF AND THE SECOND TIME AT JIFFY LUBE IN REDLANDS, CA. THE PRICE FOR SYNTHETIC OIL CHANGE WAS RIDICULOUS WHEN I CAN DO IT FOR HALF MINIMUM. HYUNDAI HAS SAID SINCE I HAVE NO INVOICES FOR OIL CHANGES THEY WILL NOT COVER MOTOR FULLY? I KNOW THE COMPUTER CAN BE ACCESSED TO SEE THE DATES WHEN I RESET THE METER MILES. I KNOW SINCE DOING MY RESEARCH HYUNDAI HAS HAD THE VERY SAME PROBLEMS WITH PRIOR YEAR CARS.

I HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING TO MY HYUNDAI DEALER FOR TWO YEARS THAT MY TUCSON STUTTERS, STAMMERS AND LOSES POWER WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO ROSEN HYUNDAI FOR THE THIRD TIME TO HAVE THEM CHECK THIS ISSUE ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, AND I FINALLY RECEIVED A RESPONSE OTHER THAN \"WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.\" THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DCT PROBLEMS AND THAT THEY WILL TAKE CORRECTIVE MEASURES TO RECTIFY IT. HE ADDED THAT THE CLUTCH PARTS REQUIRED TO FIX THE PROBLEMS ARE ON BACKORDER UNTIL MID-DECEMBER. (NOTE: AS OF 12/29/2019, PARTS ARE STILL NOT IN) HE TOOK PROMPT ACTION TO OBTAIN A RENTAL CAR FOR ME, SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, ROSEN HYUNDAI HAS (NOW) TAKEN APPROPRIATE ACTION.  THE TWO ISSUES THAT I HAVE ARE 1) I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT MY VEHICLE FOR ALMOST NEARLY TWO MONTHS WITH NO UPDATES FROM HYUNDAI ON WHEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED, AND 2) MY VEHICLE IS AN ALL-WHEEL DRIVE SUV WITH NEARLY ALL OF THE AVAILABLE BELLS AND WHISTLES, BUT HYUNDAI HAS ONLY AUTHORIZED PAYMENT TO ENTERPRISE FOR THE \"STANDARD\" RENTAL CAR. I INSISTED ON HAVING AN ALL WHEEL DRIVE SUV FOR WHICH ENTERPRISE IS DIRECTLY CHARGING ME $7.00/DAY, AND THIS VEHICLE DRIVES LIKE A BIG NOISY TRUCK HAS NO GPS ROUTING AND NOT EVEN A COMPASS. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT HYUNDAI SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED A LOANER VEHICLE OF LIKE TYPE TO ME OR AT LEAST PAY FOR A RENTAL VEHICLE THAT IS EQUAL OR BETTER THAN MY VEHICLE AT NO CHARGE TO ME! I HAVE OWNED 10 NEW HYUNDAI VEHICLES SINCE THE EARLY 2000'S. MY CURRENT TUCSON IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE NOT FELT LIKE AN APPRECIATED CUSTOMER. I WANT REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL CHARGES FROM ENTERPRISE (CURRENTLY OVER $350).",

ON 6/ 25/19 I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I LEASED MY VEHICLE FROM, ELDER HYUNDAI OF MACOMB, MICHIGAN.  THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS DISMISSIVE AND STARTED TURNING OFF ICONS, COMPROMISING EVIDENCE, HE TOLD ME THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE AFTER MANY OBJECTIONS BY ME.  THE CAR HAS SAT IN MY DRIVEWAY SINCE 6/26/19 AS I AM DEATHLY AFRAID OF USING IT CAUSE INJURY AND DEATH TO MYSELF AND OTHERS. I DID FILE AN ONLINE REPORT WITH HYUNDAI USA ON 6/26/19. THEY HAVE ONLY REQUESTED THE IMEI NUMBER TO TRACE THE CELL PHONE NUMBER. HYUNDAI AND HACKER ARE LIABLE FOR MY SAFETY.  *JS",

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT KEPT SAYING THAT THERE ARE SOME KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH ACCELERATION THAT HYUNDAI HASN'T COMMUNICATED A SOLUTION TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.     OFTEN TIMES THE RPM LEVEL SKYROCKETS LEAVING THE CAR WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. OUR 7-SPEED DCT IS HAVING SHIFTING PROBLEMS, HESITATION WITH ACCELERATION, AND NEAR LOSS OF POWER. THE TRANSMISSION PARTICULARLY MISBEHAVES DURING WARMER  TEMPERATURES AND CERTAIN DRIVING CONDITIONS. THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING, WHICH IS A SAFETY HAZARD. AND IS A DANGER TO EVERYONE ON THE ROAD. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CLAIMS THAT HYUNDAI HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION AND CONTROL MODULE PROBLEMS BUT IS NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THE VEHICLES IF WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE ALLEGED TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF LEFT TURNS ON LARGE CITY STREETS, ALMOST GETTING HIT, BECAUSE NOBODY WAS ANTICIPATING THE SUDDEN NON RESPONSE OF THE GAS PEDAL. THIS ISSUE IS HAPPENING VERY FREQUENTLY DURING LEFT TURNS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK. WE HOPE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS TAKEN SERIOUS AS IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING WITH THIS CAR.",

I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS (3X) W/MY HONDA 2014 CRV THAT'S WHY I GOT RID OF IT. I WAS TOLD BY BOTH HONDA & HYUNDAI \"ITS NOT COVERED, IT'S NOT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, IT'S CAUSED BY OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES/ RODENTS. USE YOUR AUTO INSURANCE\". THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT BECAUSE THEY USE SOY WHICH ATTRACTS THESE RODENTS. SOY WIRING HARNESSES SHOULD BE BANNED AND RECALLS INSTITUTED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM BY EITHER REPLACING THE HARNESSES WITH STANDARD SYNTHETIC NON-EDIBLE POLYMERS AS APPROPRIATE TO THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION, OR PROVIDING COATINGS THAT PROVABLY PREVENT RODENTS FROM CONSUMING THE INSULATION OVER THE LIFESPAN OF THE VEHICLE. I CAN'T EVEN PARK IN MY OWN DRIVEWAY FOR FEAR OF MORE DAMAGE THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR DUE TO THE USE OF SOY. THIS PROBLEM IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET CAUSED BY SOY USED BY VARIOUS CAR MAKERS.
