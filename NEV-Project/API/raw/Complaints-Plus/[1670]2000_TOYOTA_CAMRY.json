I EXPERIENCED BACK INJURIES AS DID THE DRIVER.  THE COMPLAINT THOUGH, IS THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, WHERE I WAS SITTING WITH MY SEAT BELT IN USE, DID NOT WITHSTAND THE COLLISION.  THE UPRIGHT PORTION OF THE SEAT WAS LAYING ON TOP OF THE BACK SEAT AFTER THE IMPACT.  THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACK AND SHOULDER INJURIES I RECEIVED.  THE TOYOTA WAS NOT HIT FROM THE SIDE SO THE FAILURE OF THE SEAT WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A DIRECT IMPACT. THE SEAT SIMPLY CAME LOOSE AND FAILED TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS I WAS THROWN FORWARD AND THEN BACK.    AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS, THE BODY SHOP CHECKED THE SEAT AND STATED THE LOCKING MECHANISM IS WORKING PROPERLY HOWEVER, THE SEAT HAS NOT BEEN \"RIGHT\" SINCE THE ACCIDENT.  IT IS NOT PROPERLY POSITIONED.   THE IMPACT WAS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL (UP TO $5000 IN DAMAGE - TRUNK WAS CRUMPLED AND OTHER DAMAGE) AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  JUST AFTER THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, I LOOKED OVER AT MY MOTHER WHO WAS DRIVING AND WATCHED IN HORROR AS SHE SNAPPED OVER THE STEERING WHEEL. I DON'T KNOW IF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES A \"HEAD-ON\" BEFORE THE BAGS WILL DEPLOY BUT THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE (INITIALLY I WAS AFRAID MY MOTHER'S NECK HAD FRACTURED) AND HAD MY MOTHER GONE ANY FURTHER FORWARD, THE FAILURE OF THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS IF NOT FATAL INJURY.  *NM",

ALMOST $410.18 LATER THE DOOR WAS OPERATIONAL, AT MY EXPENSE.

TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE SIMPLY GAVE ME A BLUNT ANSWER \"TOUGH LUCK\"  THEY NEED TO RECALL MY CAR, REPAIR IT AT TOYOTA'S EXPENSE, TOYOTA SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR SUCH INFERIOR QUALITY OF THE CAR, SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR ITS DENIAL OF CORRE FOR TOYOTA CEO'S COMMENTS ON TOYOTA'S COMMITMENT TO QUALITY, PLEASE CLICK THE FOLLOWING VIDEO LINK    HTTP://WWW.NYTIMES.COM/PACKAGES/KHTML/2006/01/09/AUTOMOBILES/20060109_TOYOTA_AUDIOSS.HTML.  *NM *JS  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

ALTHOUGH THE BRAKE FLUID LEVEL IS ALWAYS WELL ABOVE MINIMUM, OCCASIONALLY TOPPING OFF THE BRAKE FLUID TO THE MAX \"FULL\" LEVEL HELPS, BUT NOT THIS TIME.

FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE.
