AFTER I PRESENTED ALL MY FINDINGS THEY CONTACTED BMW NA AND THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION ,EXHAUST AND THE DRIVE SHAFT AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO ME. HOWEVER I DID END UP PAYING OVER $4K FOR OTHER OIL LEAKS ETC.  NOW THE VEHICLE IS BACK AT THE DEALERS WITH POPPING NOISE VERY HARD JERKING. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION  THEY NOW CLAIM THAT THE TRANSFER CASE IS BAD AND IT'LL COST $2700 (FOR THE PART ALONE) AND LABOR TO REPLACE THIS TO FIX THE ISSUE.  I LOOKED UP ON LINE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND BMW IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  SURELY THE FRONT DRIVE SHAFT AND THE TRANSMISSION ARE CONNECTED TO THE TRANSFER CASE. SO IF THE DRIVE SHAFT HAS CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION TO GO OUT ONCE THEN THAT MALFUNCTION MUST HAVE DAMAGED THE TRANSFER CASE ALSO OR IF THE INSTALL WAS NOT DONE CORRECTLY THIS COULD HAVE DAMAGED THE TRANSFER CASE. WHICH I BELIEVE BMW SHOULD ADDRESS UNDER THE RECALL FOR FRONT DRIVE SHAFT.  WHY IS NO ONE TAKING ANY ACTION ON THIS MATTER.  A FAULTY TRANSFER CASE IN THE X5 CAN CAUSE LOSS OF DRIVE AND THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATH IF THE OCCUPANTS ARE ON A FREEWAY OR IN AN INTERSECTION ETC WHERE THEY ARE STUCK.

I HEARD ON THE RADIO IN MIAMI THAT THE NEED FOR THIS RECALL WAS KNOWN TO BMW BUT REPEATED REQUESTS TO BMW TO ADDRESS THIS RECALL HAVE GONE UNANSWERED EXCEPT THAT THE DEALERS DON'T HAVE NOTICE YET FROM BMW CORPORATE.    NOTE:  I BROUGHT THIS PROBLEM TO THE ATTENTION OF BMW DEALERS AND CORPORATE IN 2011 AND PERIODICALLY SINCE WITH NO HELP.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY NEVER MENTIONED IT ON ANY REPAIR ORDERS AND ONLY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR ADJUSTS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS OPERATE THE CAR SO AS MY WIFE DROVE THE CAR PRIMARILY, I AS A SECONDARY DRIVER WOULD NEED TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE CAR TO ADJUST TO MY WAY OF DRIVING.  IN 2015 MY WIFE BEGAN DRIVING A MASERATI FULL TIME AND I WAS RELEGATED TO THE X5.  THE FAULTY ACCELERATION  HAS NEVER CHANGED AND MY WIFE, SINCE 2015, HAS NOTICED THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM WHERE BEFORE SHE BECAME USED TO THE WAY THE CAR REACTED.",

WHEN CROSSING THE GANDY BRIDGE OVER TAMPA BAY IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, MY CAR EMITTED A VERY LOUD BANG AND A RAPID SERIES OF SHAKING AND EXTREMELY HARD KNOCKS.  THE CAR LOST POWER, SMOKE BILLOWED OUT THE BACK AND I SAW A STREAM OF OIL IN THE MIRROR BEHIND ME.  I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANE.  THE PROBLEM, I HAVE FOUND, WAS THAT THE FRONT DRIVE SHAFT FAILED DUE TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN THE UNIVERSAL JOINT. WHEN IT FAILED, THE SPINNING PARTS CRACKED OPEN THE TRANSMISSION CASE, THE OIL PAN AND BROKE SEVERAL NEARBY PARTS.  THE EVENT OCCURRED ON A LONG BRIDGE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY.  THE FRONT END OF THE SPINNING DRIVE SHAFT BROKE LOOSE AND FELL DOWN, PARTS WERE EJECTED ONTO THE HIGHWAY, THE TRANSMISSION WAS CRACKED OPEN AND ALL TRANSMISSION OIL DISCHARGED ONTO THE BRIDGE. HAD THIS OCCURRED, FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE PASSING ANOTHER CAR ON A TWO LANE ROAD, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS, PERHAPS FATAL ACCIDENT.   THIS VEHICLE, FROM PRODUCTION DATES BEGINNING APRIL 5 2011, WAS OFFICIALLY RECALLED IN MAY 2016 FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE.  MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN MARCH, 2011, A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THE APPARENTLY ARBITRARY RECALL DATE OF APRIL 5. I NOW FIND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SIMILAR FAILURES, WITH PHOTOS AND DESCRIPTIONS EXACTLY LIKE MINE.  THE BMW RECALL NOTICE, WHICH I DID NOT RECEIVE BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED, STATES THAT A VIBRATION WILL BECOME NOTICEABLE, AND, IF IT FAILS, POWER TO THE FRONT WHEELS WILL BE INTERRUPTED, BUT THAT THE REAR WHEELS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK.  THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.  THE TRANSFER CASE HAD TO BE REPLACED IN MAY 2016. UPDATED 03/07/17.*JB",

TWO DAYS LATER, SAM CALLED ME AND INFORMED ME THAT HE GOT THE PAPERWORK, AND WILL BE WORKING ON MY CASE.  ON TUESDAY 08/30, I CALLED BMW BACK SINCE I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM THEM, I REQUESTED TO TALK TO SAM, BUT THE PHONE ASSISTANT INFORMED ME THAT HE IS NOT AVAILABLE, BUT BASED ON THE NOTES AVAILABLE TO HER, I AM BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH MILEAGE ON THE CAR (62K MILES).
