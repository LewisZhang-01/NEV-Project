FAILURE WAS NOTICED WHEN WE STOPPED AT AN RV PARK AT THE END OF DAY.  BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES FAILED AT THE CONNECTION OF THE PINBOX TO THE MAIN FRAME.  THE WELDS AT THE POINT OF CONNECTION DID NOT FAIL, RATHER IT WAS THE BASE METAL THAT CRACKED AND ALLOWED THE TRAILER FRONT TO DROP DOWN.  EITHER THE STEEL WAS TOO LIGHT FOR THIS APPLICATION OR WAS INFERIOR IN SOME OTHER WAY.  I SEE THAT LIPPERT HAS EXPERIENCED THIS FAILURE MANY TIMES BEFORE.  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION TO ALERT ME TO THIS PROBLEM  WHEN A PROBLEM LIKE THIS THAT HAZARDS HUMAN LIVES EXISTS WHY HASN'T SOMETHING BEEN DONE TO CORRECT IT.  AT THE VERY LEAST THEY COULD HAVE WARNED ALL PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LIPPERT FRAME TO BE ON THE WATCH FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  LIPPERT SHOULD HAVE TO CORRECT DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY HAVE FOISTED ON A PUBLLIC THAT PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEM.  THE MANUFACTURER THAT USED THEIR PRODUCT SHOULD HAVE TO STEP UP AND ACCEPT THEIR SHARE OF THE BLAME ALSO.  IS THERE NO SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY OR HONOR IN THESE COMPANIES INVOLVING THEIR PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN PRODUCTS THAT FAIL MAY COST SOMEONE THEIR LIFE ?",

ON ARRIVAL IN SAN DIEGO, WE DISCOVERED THE PIN-BOX HAD GONE FROM A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO HORIZONTAL AND WAS PUSHED UP INTO THE FRONT CAP OF OUR TRAILER, RESULTING IN THE TRAILER NEARLY SITTING ON THE GUNWHALES OF OUR DODGE RAM 3500 AND THE FLOOR OF THE BEDROOM ABOVE THE HITCH BUCKLED UPWARDS.  THE STRUCTURE WAS FIELD-REPAIRED ON-SITE BY LIPPERT COMPONENTS INC., THE FRAME MANUFACTURER, AND THE UNIT MOVED TO LA FOR SHOP REPAIRS.  ON RETURN TO CANADA, I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT OF EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM AT OUR DEALERSHIP AND SEVERAL MORE DISCUSSED ON THE INTERNET ON USER SITES (ONE OF WHICH IS ALSO A 2006 OPEN ROAD).  NEITHER PILGRIM INTERNATIONAL NOR LIPPERT COMPONENTS INC. ARE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM (MATERIAL, DESIGN, WORKSMANSHIP), SO OUR 'REPAIRED' UNIT CONTINUES TO BE A LIABILITY AND WE ARE RELUCTANT TO TAKE IT ON THE ROAD AGAIN.
