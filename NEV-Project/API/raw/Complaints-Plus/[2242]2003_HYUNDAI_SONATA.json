Moved wiring around and made sure connectors were properly plugged and the light went away for maybe a week. Light is back on again. Removed seat bolts to gain better access, used tubing and electrical tape to straighten any kinked wiring I could find underneath passenger front seat, disconnected and reconnected connections. Airbag light blinked once and still remains on with the code still pointing to the passenger seat wiring. Apparently this issue has been reported many times in online forums with no meaningful response from the company though this clearly affects proper airbag deployment.",

THEIR SOLUTION WAS TO WRAP MY HANDLES WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE; AFTER MY OBJECTION, THEY INSTALLED THE SAME RECALLED HANDLES. I'VE HAD MY INTERIOR HANDLES REPLACED THREE TIMES BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER DIDN'T MAKE THE HANDLES OUT OF A DIFFERENT MATERIAL AND CHOOSES TO REINSTALL THE SAME RECALLED HANDLE.

A SERVICE REP INFORMED ME THAT ONCE THE COMPANY REPLACES ANY RECALLED ITEMS THE FIRST TIME, IT IS THE CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THEM IF THEY FAIL AGAIN. SURELY, THIS CANNOT BE CORRECT!

I DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM ONE NIGHT AFTER LOCKING MY CAR AND THEN SENDING MY FRIEND TO RETRIEVE AN ITEM FROM THE VEHICLE. I FORGOT TO GIVE MY FRIEND THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE CAR AND AS A RESULT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE RETURNED WITH THE ITEM. I INQUIRED HOW HE DID THIS HIS RESPONSE WAS THE LEFT REAR DOOR WAS OPEN. UPON FURTHER INVESTIF=GATION AND ATTEMPTING TO LOCK THE CAR WITH THE REMOTE IT WAS REALIZED THAT THE LOCK WAS NOT RESPONDING. THIS SITUATION WAS SCARY TO KNOW BECAUSE MY FAMILY DRIVES THE CAR AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND THIS CAN ENDANGER THEM IF SOMEONE COMES INTO THE VEHICLE WHILE THEY ARE AWAY FROM THE CAR. LIVING IN NY AND ENVIRONS MOST OF THE TIMES OUR CARS ARE PARKED ON THE STREET AND A PROSPECTIVE THIEF CAN ACCESS THE CAR EASILY. THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED THE LEFT REAR DOOR ACTUATOR AFTER MANY CALLS TO THE MANUFACTURER. I HAD TO PAY A REDUCED COST OF $50 TO GET IT FOXED AFTER HYUNDAI AGREED TO SUPPLY THE NECESSARY PART SINCE THE CAR HAD JUST CROSSED 60000 MILES/ 5 YEARS . THEY SAID THE REASON THE ACTUATOR BECOMES FAULTY IS THEIR INABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE CURRENT EVENLY TO THE SYSTEM.    NOW THE RIGHT REAR DOOR ACTUATOR HAS BECOME FAULTY AT 70000 PLUS MILES AND BOTH PARTIES, THE DEALERSHIP AND HYUNDAI, REFUSE TO FIX THE PROBLEM ALTHOUGH IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE A KNOWN AND POSSIBLE DEFECT IN THESE VEHICLES. THE DOOR NOW STAYS IN THE LOCK POSITION BUT AGAIN IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE IF I'M TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE CAR IN AN EMERGENCY....PLEASE ADVISE HYUNDAI TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT....AND REPLACE ALL DEFECTIVE ACTUATORS IN THEIR LINE OF VEHICLES. *TR",

THE LIGHT BULB IN THE BRAKE AREA HAD BOTH LOW AND HIGH LIGHT ON.  I CHANGED OUT THE BULB TWICE THAT DAY THINKING MAYBE THE BULB IS BAD.  WHEN I LOOKED AT THE PART THAT HOLDS THE BULB IT LOOKED BLACK LIKE IT WAS BURNING.  STILL THE TWO LIGHTS STAYED ON.  I TALKED TO MY FRIEND IN MICHIGAN WHO IS A MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME IT SOUNDS AN ELECTRIC PROBLEM.  THEN THE CAR ALSO STARTED TO DIE AFTER DRIVING IT FOR A WHILE.  I HAD TO HAVE IT JUMPED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WHEN I HAD THE BATTERY CHECKED IT WAS FINE.  I TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AGAIN AND TOLD HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THAT THE CAR WAS HAVING ELECTRIC ISSUES.  I TOLD HIM I CHANGED THE BULB TWICE AND THAT THE PART THAT WAS HOLDING THE BULB WAS BLACK AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS BURNING.  GUESS WHAT... THEY KEPT IT FOR TWO DAYS.  I CALLED THAT SAME DAY AND THE NEXT AND WAS TOLD THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT BECAUSE THEY WERE TO BUSY.  WHEN THEY FINALLY DID GET TO IT THE GUY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS JUST THE BULB.  I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE BURNING PART AND WAS TOLD THAT WAS FINE.  (CAR HAD ABOUT 59000 MILES ON IT)  NOW PLEASE TELL ME HOW IT WAS JUST THE BULB WHEN I PUT TWO NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO IN AND IT DID NOT CHANGE.  I ASKED IF HE HAD CHECKED THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND WAS TOLD ALL WAS FINE.  HE ALSO SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND THERE WAS NO REASON FOUND AS TO WHY IT WOULD NOT START.",

THEY REPLACED THE TIRE, AND THREE DAYS LATER, THE TIRE WENT FLAT AGAIN WHILE TRAVELLING ON THE HIGHWAY.  I EXPIRENCED TWO MORE FLAT TIRES ON THE SAME WHEEL WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER THE LEFT TIRE WENT FLAT.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VALVE STEM WAS BEING CUT BY THE HUBCAP.  NTB SUGGESTED THAT I GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEM INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION.  I WENT TO POHANKA IN FREDERICKSBURG, VA AND THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT THE HUBCAP WAS MAKING CONTACT WITH THE TIRE WHEN THERE SHOULD BE A SMALL GAP SEPARATING THE TWO.  THE SUGGESTION FROM THE DEALERSHIP WAS TO CHANGE THE TIRE OR REPLACE THE RIM.  I WENT BACK TO NTB, AND THEY CONFERRED WITH BF GOODRICH, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE TIRE, AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT I GO BACK TO THE STOCK TIRE THAT WAS ON THE CAR.  I HAD ALSO FILED A CLAIM WITH HYUNDAI, AND THEIR SUGGESTION WAS THE SAME. MY PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS, IS FIRST, I SELECTED A TIRE THAT WAS THE PROPER SIZE FOR MY CAR (BF GOODRICH TRACTION T/A 205/65R15).  NOWHERE HAD IT BEEN INDICATED BY HYUNDAI OR BFGOODRICH THAT THE SELECTED TIRE WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR MY VEHICLE.  SECONDLY, MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OTHERS BECAME ENDANGERED BY THIS PROBLEM.  THIRDLY, I AM BEING FORCED TO MAKE TIRE SELECTION, BECAUSE NEITHER HYUNDAI, NOR BF GOODRICH HAVE PROVIDED LIMITING INFORMATION ON THE TIRES THAT WILL PROPERLY FUNCTION WITH MY CAR. THIS IS SERIOUS AND NEEDS IMMEDIATED ATTENTION BY SOMEONE, BEFORE THERE IS LOSS OF LIFE OR SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEONE BECAUSE HYUNDAI'S HUBCAP FOR THE SONATA IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE TIRE SIZE THAT IT HAS INDICATED WITHIN THE OWNER'S MANUAL AND THE LABEL ON THE CAR.*AK",
