THEY ENGAGED THEIR TECHNICAL TEAMS AND COULD NOT DETERMINE THE ISSUE AFTER 5 DAYS. THEY'VE REQUESTED THAT I PICKUP THE VEHICLE AND ADVISED IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO BRING IT BACK. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS AN UNDIAGNOSED ELECTRICAL/COMPUTER ISSUE THAT COULD POSE A SAFETY ISSUE IF IT HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING, PARTICULARLY ON THE FREEWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I SIMPLY WANT TO ENSURE YOU'RE MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND POTENTIAL RISK SHOULD THIS BE SOMETHING BEYOND JUST MY VEHICLE.
