We got off the exit in Macon, Georgia to eat dinner and once we got off the exit, the car would barely move. We had the car towed to Five Star Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Macon. They said it was a transmission problem. They took the transmission apart and found that the transmission pump was bad and destroyed the transmission. There is a safety recall #16V461000 for transmission pump failure for Town & Country's manufactured between July 31, 2015 and April 18, 2016. Our car was manufactured in November of 2015 which falls under the recall manufacturing dates. We called Chrysler customer service and they said that our Vin # was not part of the recall. They were unable to tell us why our car was not included and said that there was nothing they could do even though our car only has 62,572 miles and was always serviced at the Chrysler dealership. We were told that the transmission repair will cost up to $8,000 and will take a month to a month and a half to fix it. Even though our last three vehicles and been Chrysler Town & Country vans, we will never consider another Chrysler product again.",

Both the gas pedal and breaking system went off line as well.  Luckily, there wasn't any vehicles in the immediate vicinity.  She was able to allow the vehicle to coast to a stop as she wrestled with the steering wheel to try and get the vehicle to the side of the road.  As the vehicle was slowing down (to around 25 mph), the speedometer indicated that she was at 100+ mph.    This could have been devastating in most situation.  Just prior to getting on the interstate, she was on a one lane road with 18-wheelers passing by her head-on.  What if this was to occur if she was approach a cross walk with pedestrians crossing, or other vehicles (to include motorcycles), she would not have been able to stop.  When she finally made it over to the side and the vehicle had stopped.  She turned the vehicle off and everything was fine again, like nothing ever happened.  This is our first and hopefully last occurrence.  But looking online, this is nowhere near being close to the first occurrence of this type.  Please see the following website which shows 413 reports for this make and model (but various years): https://www.carproblemzoo.com/chrysler/town_country/steering-problems.php  There is also this website as well:  https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-steering-wheel-lock-up-while-driving The problem with that site is there are too many geniuses on there stating that this is not possible and follow on by showing their knowledge, etc.  Others addressed solely the steering wheel issue stating it's a pump or fluid, etc.  It also mentions of make/model this had occurred on (i.e. Mazda, Chevy Corvette - recall, etc.).  Regardless, this is a major life threatening issue that is constantly occurring out there.  Sadly, there are probably several instances where as the driver did not survive the incident, hence unable to report it.",

I am a young single mother of two children, and as I felt like I was truly blessed to get any car that would be reliable to take me to work. Unfortunately, I was leased a 2016 Chrysler Town Country vehicle, as I still owe $11,000 after making monthly payments of $367.00 since May 13th, 2021., with a $4,200 payment down. What I thought was a blessing for my situation, but in reality it was a predatorial loan in disguises from The Contra Costa County, public Auto Auction.          As I only had this car for 5 months, I am now seeming to be extremely frustrated that I am being charged $500.00 to get my car serviced, as Chrysler Dealership is the only reliable source to service this vehicle due to the complication of their being a specific machine to add transmission fluid into the transmission. There is a check engine light exact for my transmission sensors, but it actually needs to be changed immediately.       Due to my financial hardship that COIVD has caused me as a young single mother, I am unable to pay for this unknown excessive charge for the proper service. This is causing a huge delay within trying to get this problem fixed before the transmission ends up blowing out on me. I was also informed that I would not be eligible to get a rental in return for the amount of days that It will take to get an appointment at a Chrysler Dealership.     Please have a supervisor contact me immediately regarding this concern, this is causing a serious matter. My contact information is as listed below:  [XXX]      Thank you in advance for your time, and consideration regarding this unfortunate disaster of getting this specific car without knowing exactly what programs I would run into in the near future.

Manage to find gas and my dad who is 81 looked but could not really see anything and we managed to make it to the  exit where we were suppose to meet my dad's cousin for dinner and meet him for the first time and my dad seeing him for the first time in over 53 years. I barely got it to the gas station and he came and got us and we went to eat. I called my husband and him and my sister drove about three hours to get us and my husband to look at the car. I had gotten a hotel room for us (my mom and dad, granddaugher and I). My husband looked at it and was researching it while on the way up to Asheville. He drove around the parking lot and then he attempted to drive it to the hotel which was on the other side of the interstate and not even a half mile away and we barely got there and said he can't drive it home. It was not even shifting manually into the gears  . The next day he got a ride to Asheville and rented a uhaul truck with a tow dolly and towed it home and the next day he took it to the transmission shop where we need a rebuilt transmission ours is gone.

A BODY SHOP GOT THE ACTUATOR UNSTUCK, BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT WAS STUCK AGAIN, THIS TIME IN THE UNLOCKED POSITION. I STARTED RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ONLINE AND FOUND A WAY TO GET THE LOCK UNSTUCK AND I USED THAT TRICK WHEN IT STUCK IN THE LOCKED POSITION, BUT OVER TIME THE ACTUATOR HAS ALSO STARTED BUZZING. NOW WHEN THE POWER DOOR LOCKS ARE ACTIVATED, INSTEAD OF LOCKING OR UNLOCKING THE ACTUATOR ON THIS DOOR JUST BUZZES LOUDLY AND THE LOCK MECHANISM DOESN'T MOVE.  IT'S BEEN BUZZING FOR MONTHS NOW, SO I DECIDED TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH AND SEE IF IT WAS AN ISSUE I FELT COMFORTABLE FIXING MYSELF.  ONCE I STARTED LOOKING, I FOUND SEVERAL FORUMS WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE, AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT EVERYONE REPORT THIS ISSUE TO POSSIBLY CREATE A RECALL IF THE FAILURE RATE OF THE ACTUATOR IS HIGH ENOUGH. I ALSO FOUND THAT THE PART THAT NEEDS REPLACED IS INEXPENSIVE, IT'S LESS THAN $50. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING THE PART, THE ENTIRE DOOR PANEL HAS TO BE TAKEN APART TO ACCESS IT, THE AVERAGE REPAIR QUOTE FOR THIS REPAIR IS IN THE $700-$800 RANGE.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A REALLY POOR DESIGN CHOICE FOR A PART THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH FAILURE RATE.  IF YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR A SHORT VIDEO OF THE BUZZ, SINCE A PICTURE WILL NOT REALLY SHOW THE ISSUE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  THANK YOU!*DT *AS",

YET EVERY ONE IN THIS COMPLAINT FORUM FOR THIS SPECIFIC VEHICLE HAVE SAID THEY HAVE LOOKED ONLINE TO CHECK FOR RECALLS AND ONE OF THE RECALLS FOR THE 2016 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY IS A TRANSMISSION PUMP FAILURE. ARE OTHER WEBSITES THAT RUN VIN CHECKS GIVING OUT MISLEADING INFORMATION OR IS IT THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH THIS VEHICLE ARE ALL HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THERE CAR STALLING OUT AND LOSING MOTIVE POWER. THE NHTSA SHOULD BE TAKING THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY. YOU SAY RIGHT ON YOUR WEBSITE THAT THIS STUFF FUELS YOU. START FUELING AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE GETS INJURED OR DIES BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. CHECK OUT VEHICLEHISTORY.COM THIS YEAR MODEL AND MAKE. IT SHOWS IT RIGHT ON THERE THE RECALL THAT EVERY ONE OF US SEEMS TO BE HAVING IN THIS COMPLAINT FORUM.

AFTER CALLING MY HUSBAND ON THE PHONE, I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND CALLED INTERSTATE EMERGENCY TOWING TO TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY. THE EMPLOYEE AT THE DEALERSHIP NOTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A TRANSMISSION-RELATED RECALL ON 2016 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY MINIVANS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED DURING SPECIFIC MONTHS AND THAT MY MINIVAN FELL WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME. HOWEVER, AT A LATER DATE I WAS TOLD THAT MY MINIVAN VIN WAS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL, EVEN THOUGH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE TRANSMISSION PUMP WHICH CAUSED A LOSS OF POWER (PART OF THE INITIAL RECALL PROBLEM). PLEASE SEE THE INITIAL ESTIMATE THAT IS ATTACHED. THEY ORDERED A NEW TRANSMISSION PUMP, WHICH WE HAD TO WAIT ALMOST A WEEK TO COME IN. THE DAY THAT THE TRANSMISSION PUMP ARRIVED, MY HUSBAND ASKED THEM TO EMAIL HIM THE ESTIMATE SO THAT HE COULD SHOW CHRYSLER THAT OUR VAN HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS THE INITIAL RECALL. ONCE THE DEALERSHIP LEARNED THAT WE WERE CONTESTING THE RECALL, THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION PUMP AFTER ALL .  WHEN WE WENT TO PICK UP THE VAN, THEY SAID THAT THEY ONLY HAD TO REPLACE THE TORQUE CONVERTER (SEE FINAL INVOICE ATTACHED). WE THINK THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT OUR VAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED AND FIXED UNDER THE RECALL, AND/OR THEY DO NOT WANT THE RECALL EXPANDED.",

THEY PERFORMED A FULL TUNE UP AND DROVE IT A BIT AND THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS OFF BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WHEN I STARTED THE VEHICLE THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON SO I TOOK IT DIRECTLY BACK TO THE MECHANIC AND THEY LOOKED MORE INTO THE DIAGNOSTIC CODE THAT IT WAS READING AND FOUND A RECALL ON THIS SAME EXACT DIAGNOSTIC CODE FOR THE 2016 GRAND CARAVAN 3.6 AND 2016 JOURNEY 3.6 MADE BY DODGE...WHICH ARE THE EXACT ENGINES AS THE CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY SO I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE RECALL ON MY VEHICLE FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  I THEN CONTACTED CHRYSLER DIRECTLY AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD GLADLY HONOR THE RECALL IF YOUR ORGANIZATION ISSUED THE RECALL FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLE SINCE IT IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE RECALL THAT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE 2016 GRAND CARAVAN AND JOURNEY, RECALL #627908.  MY VEHICLE NEEDS A CYLINDER HEAD REPAIRED OR REPLACED AND I DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE IT AND DO POSSIBLE FURTHER DAMAGE.  I AM TRYING TO BE A RESPONSIBLE CONSUMER AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE CORRECTLY BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON A MAJOR ENGINE ISSUE FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS JUST OVER 3 YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND WHEN THERE IS AN OPEN RECALL FOR 2 COMPARABLE VEHICLES THAT HAVE THE EXACT SAME ENGINE.",
