HOWEVER, ONE MORNING WHEN THE HESITATION WAS VERY PRONOUNCED I POPPED THE HOOD TO HAVE A LOOK.  WATER WAS STANDING ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE TOP OF THE BATTERY IN THE AREA HOUSING THAT PART.  I USED MY INDOOR/OUTDOOR VACUUM TO PUMP OUT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE.

HE DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO DETERMINE THAT DRAINAGE HOLES ON BOTH SIDES UNDER THE HOOD WERE CLOGGED.  HE WAS ABLE TO UNCLOG THE HOLE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IMMEDIATELY, BUT THE HOLE ON THE DRIVER SIDE IS LOCATED BENEATH PARTS THAT HAVE TO BE MOVED FOR ACCESS.

WE ALWAYS MAINTAINED OUR PASSAT SCRUPULOUSLY ACCORDING TO VW STANDARDS AT THEIR SERVICE CENTERS BY THEIR TRAINED MECHANICS. ONE MONTH EARLIER WE HAD BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO BE CHECKED BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WOULD NOT START AFTER DRIVING IT SOMEPLACE. TWICE HAD TO WAIT FOR AAA TOWING.  AAA ABLE TO START IT RIGHT UP AS THOUGH NOTHING WAS WRONG. VW RAN \"FAULT CODES\" BUT FOUND NO PROBLEM.WE BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY AT VW'S SUGGESTION.    SOMETHING WENT HORRIBLY WRONG WITH OUR CAR INSPITE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE MAINTENANCE.  WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY NOT TO BE KILLED. WE WISH TO KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER CASES LIKE OURS.

UPON FURTHER RESEARCH WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE, IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THIS FAILURE IS FAIRLY COMMON ON 1998-2001 PASSATS, BUT NO ACTION HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN BY THE MANUFACTURER. I INTEND TO HAVE THE ABS MODULE REBUILT AND DO THE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION WORK MYSELF; THE RESULT SHOULD BE AROUND $220 OUT OF POCKET. HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT DEALERSHIP SERVICE WORK FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM HAVE SPENT WELL IN EXCESS OF $1,000.

UPON FURTHER RESEARCH WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS FAILURE IS COMMON ON 1998-2001 PASSATS (AND AUDI A4S) WITH THE BOSCH 5.3 ABS MODULE.  THE DEALERSHIP ACTED AS IF THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH AN INDEPENDENT SHOP SAID THEY HAD REPLACED SEVERAL AT THEIR SHOP. HOWEVER, NO ACTION HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN BY THE MANUFACTURER. I DID OPT TO HAVE THE ABS MODULE REBUILT BY A THIRD PARTY. THE RESULT WAS A $400.00 INSTEAD OF $1000.00 AT THE DEALER. OUTRAGEOUSLY, MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT VWOA DEALERSHIP SERVICE WORK FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM HAVE SPENT WELL OVER $1,000. THE APPARENT FAILURE RATE OF THIS MODULE, AND THE FACT THAT IT DEGRADES THE OPERATION OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SAFETY FEATURE OF A CAR (THE BRAKES), MAKE IT MY OPINION THAT IT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO RECALL. RECALL ACTION SHOULD INCLUDE COMPENSATION FOR OWNERS WHO HAVE UNDERTAKEN REPAIRS, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE FAULTY MODULE. THANK YOU. DK *TR",

THE LIGHT ACTIVATES EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR, BUT DOES NOT TURN ON UNTIL THE BRAKES ARE WARM. THE ABS SYSTEM IS NOT FUNCTIONAL IN THIS STATE, WHICH MEANS THE CAR IS DRIVABLE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SAFE UNDER PANIC STOP OR REDUCED TRACTION CONDITIONS. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS FAILURE IS COMMON ON 1998-2001 PASSATS (AND AUDI A4S) WITH THE BOSCH 5.3 ABS MODULE. HOWEVER, NO ACTION HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN BY THE MANUFACTURER. I MAY OPT TO HAVE THE ABS MODULE REBUILT BY A THIRD PARTY, AND DO THE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION WORK MYSELF; THE RESULT WOULD BE AT LEAST $200 OUT OF POCKET. OUTRAGEOUSLY, MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT VWOA DEALERSHIP SERVICE WORK FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM HAVE SPENT WELL OVER $1,000. THE APPARENT FAILURE RATE OF THIS MODULE, AND THE FACT THAT IT DEGRADES THE OPERATION OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SAFETY FEATURE OF A CAR (THE BRAKES), MAKE IT MY OPINION THAT IT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO RECALL. RECALL ACTION SHOULD INCLUDE COMPENSATION FOR OWNERS WHO HAVE UNDERTAKEN REPAIRS, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE FAULTY MODULE.   THANK YOU. *TR",

THIS MODULE CONTROLS MULTIPLE BRAKE-RELATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THE ABS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR WINTER DRIVING, BUT THE MOST CRITICAL FUNCTION OF THIS MODULE IS PROBABLY THE ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION, OR EBD. THESE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF THE EBD IS INOPERATIVE, THE PROPORTION OF HYDRAULIC FORCE APPLIED TO THE REAR BRAKES DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING IS AS GREAT AS IT IS DURING MODERATE BRAKING EFFORT WHEN THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFER OF VEHICLE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT WHEELS. THE EBD IS SUPPOSED TO ADJUST THE FRONT/REAR BRAKING DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICALLY ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF THE DECELERATION, SO THAT THE REAR WHEELS WILL NOT LOCK UP DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING. IF THIS MODULE SHOULD FAIL DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING ON DRY PAVEMENT, THE REAR WHEELS COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD EASILY INCLUDE FATALITIES. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR OWNERS, COSTING ROUGHLY $2000, AND MANY OWNERS HAVE PROBABLY PUT OFF THE REPAIR INDEFINITELY.

I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED ONLINE FOR FEEDBACK AND FOUND IT COULD POSSIBLY BE A CRACKED HEATER CORE (WHICH IS NOT COVERED UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY). I TOOK IT BY A VW DEALER FOR A DRIVE BY DIAGNOSIS, IT WAS CONFIRMED IT WAS THE HEATER CORE.  I CONTACTED VW OF AMERICA IMMEDIATELY TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS PROBLEM AND ASKED IF THEY COULD ASSIST WITH 50%-100% OF THE REPAIRS BECAUSE IT WAS A REPORTED PROBLEM EVERYWHERE.

I NOTIFIED VW OF AMERICA CUSTOMER CARE THAT THE DIAGNOSIS WAS PERFORMED AND READY. I HAD TO PAY $99.00 FOR THE SO CALLED ONE HOUR DIAGNOSIS APPT, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CONFIRMED IN 10 MINUTES.

SOME OF THE MORE MEMORABLE NORMAL REPAIRS INCLUDED REAR BRAKES AT 40,000 MILES (FRONT BRAKES WERE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION) FOR APPROX. $700.00, AND THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR ADJUSTOR FOR $400.00.

THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS SITUATION OCCURED IN JULY 1ST 2005, WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AND WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR DEALER FOR SERVICE.  THE RESULT OF THE CHECK WAS THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS (2 OF THEM) NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, AT A TOTAL COST OF $3,400.00!

FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, THE CAR WAS RANDOMLY AND VISIBLY LEAKING GASOLINE ONTO THE GROUND JUST IN FRONT OF THE FUEL FILTER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. IT LEAKED GASOLINE IN PUDDLES AND THE ENGINE BEGAN RUNNING 'LEAN' ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, WITH SIGNIFICANT VALVE CLATTER.  DUE TO THE SERIOUS SAFETY RISK POSED BY THE PROFUSE GASOLINE LEAK, I IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF THE CAR AND HAD IT  TOWED TO A REPUTABLE VW DEALER IN A NEARBY TOWN.  UPON INSPECTION AT THE DEALER, THE FUEL LINE HAD CLEARLY SPLIT ON THE TOP SIDE JUST IN FRONT OF THE FUEL FILTER....FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  I SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT AND A  REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST TO VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA RE. THIS ISSUE, DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK AND REPAIR COST CREATED BY THE FUEL LEAK. UNFORTUNATELY,  VW ULTIMATELY REFUSED TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT CITING THE AGE AND MILEAGE OF THE CAR.  AT THE TIME, THE CAR WAS 3 YEARS OLD AND HAD JUST OVER 55K MILES.  I PAID OVER $700 TO HAVE THE LINE REPLACED, PLUS TOWING FEES, AND VW PROVIDED EXACTLY $0 IN REIMBURSEMENT.  THIS EPISODE IS ON RECORD WITH VWOA AND WITH MARTENS VW IN BETHESDA, MD.

HE FURTHER STATED THAT WHEN THE OIL GETS TO HOT THE OIL CYRSTALIZES AND THEN TURNSS TO SLUDGE.  GIVEN THAT INFORMATION I THEN PROCEEDED TO GET MY CAR SERVICED.  HOWEVER UPON THE DATE OF SERVICE ( EVEN KNOWING THE PROBLEM) MY CAR WAS DIAGNOSED AT A COST TO ME   FOR $75.00.  AT THE TIME OF SERVICE I LEARNED THAT THE PUMP WAS ONLY COVERED UNDER THE WARRENTY IF I COULD PRODUCE 5 YEARS OF OIL SLIPS.  I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS REGARDING THIS MATTER.  THE FIRST, THE OWNERS MANNUAL DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THE PUMPS ARE SENSATIVE TO CERTAIN TYPES OF OILS (SYNTHETIC).  SECONDLY, THE MANNUAL DOES NOT STATE THAT THE WARRENTY REPAIRS WILL ONLY BE COVERDED IF ALL RECEIPTS FOR SERVICES PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE ARE PROVIDED.  THRIDLY, IT IS CLEAR IN MY MIND THAT IF A MANUFRACTURER PLACES A DEFAULT OR DEFECTIVE OIL PUMP IN A CAR THAT IT SHOULD BE A RECALL?

FOURTHLY, WHEN CONTACTING VOLKESWAGON DIRECTLY I SPOKE TO CUSTOMER \"CARE\" THE ATTIDUDE WAS APPAULING.

THIS MODULE CONTROLS MULTIPLE BRAKE-RELATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THE ABS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR WINTER DRIVING, BUT THE MOST CRITICAL FUNCTION OF THIS MODULE IS PROBABLY THE ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION, OR EBD. THESE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF THE EBD IS INOPERATIVE, THE PROPORTION OF HYDRAULIC FORCE APPLIED TO THE REAR BRAKES DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING IS AS GREAT AS IT IS DURING MODERATE BRAKING EFFORT WHEN THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFER OF VEHICLE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT WHEELS. THE EBD IS SUPPOSED TO ADJUST THE FRONT/REAR BRAKING DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICALLY ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF THE DECELERATION, SO THAT THE REAR WHEELS WILL NOT LOCK UP DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING. IF THIS MODULE SHOULD FAIL DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING ON DRY PAVEMENT, THE REAR WHEELS COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD EASILY INCLUDE FATALITIES. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR OWNERS, COSTING ROUGHLY $2000, AND MANY OWNERS HAVE PROBABLY PUT OFF THE REPAIR INDEFINITELY.

ALSO THE FOLLOWING QUIT WORKING: POWER MIRRORS, THE TRAVEL COMPUTER, TEMPERATURE SENSOR WAS ERRATIC, FUEL DOOR QUIT AND THE FUEL MILEAGE GAUGE MALFUNCTIONED. MOST RECENTLY, THE CAR STARTED RUNNING ROUGH AND A CLEAR, VISCOUS FLUID APPEARED ON MY GARAGE FLOOR. THE CAR HAS 25,000 MILES. WE CHANGE THE OIL REGULARLY. IT HAD A 15,000-MILE CHECK-UP. WE TOOK THE CAR TO A REPUTABLE MECHANIC (MANDER AUTOMOTIVE IN HELOTES, TEXAS). THE OWNER OF MANDER (BOB MANDER) WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS CAR HAD SO MANY ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER PROBLEMS. ANCIRA INFORMED (MANDER) THAT THE CAR'S WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED BY 900 MILES (24,990) THAT VISIT (11/6/03). COMPUTER SCAN AND ANALYSIS SHOWED SEVERAL CODES RELATED TO MISFIRES AND RUNNING LEAN. ALSO: TRANSAXLE SEAL LEAK AND BATTERY FAILED THE LOAD TEST-WOULD NOT HOLD ACHARGE. MANDER FIXED: SEAL LEAK, REPLACED THE BATTERY, CHANGED THE OIL, REPLACED THE ACTUATOR (FUEL DOOR), REPAIRED VACUUM LEAKS, RESET THE T.E.H. COMPUTER AND CORRECTED THE FAULTY WIRING TO THE MIRRORS. WE SPENT $649. 24 HOURS LATER-\"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT RE-APPEARED. THE CAR BEGAN TO VIBRATE HARD. WE TOOK THE CAR BACK TO MR. MANDER (11/14/03). HE FOUND A DEFECTIVE OXYGEN SENSOR AND PROBLEM WITH THE COOLANT SENSOR- BOTH REPLACED. THAT TIME WE SPENT $358. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP WITH MANDER AUTOMOTIVE AND TRUST THEIR WORK AND ANALYSIS. THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT AND \"EMISSIONS CONTROL\" LIGHT IS BACK ON. THE CAR IS RUNNING HARD, AGAIN.  I HAVE CONTACTED VW (REFERENCE #30522917) AND MY HUSBAND WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT DEALER HERE IN SAN ANTONIO (ROD EAST).   *LA",

THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T TAKE A LOOK AT THE CAR FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS BECAUSE IT WASN'T A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND WE SHOULD JUST KEEP DRIVING IT.  AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF DRIVING THE CAR, WE SMELLED GASOLINE FUMES COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT (WHILE DRIVING, NOT WHILE STARTING).  WE THEN INSISTED THAT MARTENS LOOK AT THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT ALL FOUR FUEL INJECTORS WERE LEAKING FUEL THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE INJECTORS INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND NEEDED REPLACING. HE CLAIMED THAT SOMETHING IN THE GASOLINE WAS MELTING THE SEALS. THE CAR HAS ONLY 33,421 MILES ON IT. IT HAS HAD REGULAR SERVICE AT VOLKSWAGEN DEALERS AND WAS ONLY FILLED UP WITH 93 OCTANE GASOLINE BOUGHT IN THE US AS REQUIRED BY VOLKSWAGEN. IN ADDITION WE HAVE NEVER USED ANY FUEL ADDITIVES. I BELIEVE THAT THESE FUEL INJECTORS ARE DEFECTIVE AND THERE MAY BE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO BEING TOLD TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON WHO MAY IN FACT HAVE GASOLINE LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT DUE TO LEAKING INJECTORS. THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THAT NHTSA INVESTIGATE IF A SAFETY RECALL IS NEEDED TO PREVENT ENGINE FIRES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM DEFECTIVE FUEL INJECTORS IN THIS MODEL VOLKSWAGEN.   *NLM",

WHILE IN THE DEALER SERVICE WAITING ROOM, AFEMALE OWNING A VW JETTA, SPOKE OF HAVING A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH HER 2001 0R 2002 MODEL. HAD WE BEEN TRAVELING ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY AND HAD THESE PROBLEMS, THE ACTION OF THE VEHICLE COULD VERY LIKELY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH. EVERY TIME I OPERATE THE CAR, I FEEL AS THOUGH A REPETITION OF HTE BEHAVIOR COULD HAPPEN AND I FEEL THE SAFETY OF ANY OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR ARE IN JEAPORDY.  *AK",
