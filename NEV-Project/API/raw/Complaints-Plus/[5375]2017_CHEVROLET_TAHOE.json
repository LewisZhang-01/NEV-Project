When this occurs, the brake pedal is extremely difficult to push, and increasing stopping distance is required because the vaccuum level drops. 2) Since the Electronic Brake Control Module resets within the vehicle's computer when the vehicle is turned off/back on again, the dealership cannot duplicate the problem; as it does not happen all the time. 3) There is an active recall no. 19V645000; Recall date: September 6, 2019; on the make and model year of my vehicle - 2017 Chevy Tahoe - for this exact issue; however, my specific VIN does not have any recalls tied to it. If you can please add my VIN to the same issue happening with recall no. 19V645000, I would appreciate it.  4) I contacted GM, and all they kept telling me is my vehicle does not have a recall tied to my specific VIN; however, my 2017 Chevy Tahoe is exihibiting the exact same symptoms as that which is listed in recall no. 19V645000. The solution is for the dealership to reset the Electronic Brake Control Module; however, they will not do so because they cannot replicate the issue and my VIN is not coming up on the recall list for my vehicle.  5) In the recall notice, it states that GM \"has not yet provided a notification schedule\", so if you can possibly let me know if my vehicle will be recalled for this issue, I would appreciate it since not having acceptable brakes to the vaccuum level drop is a safety issue.

Last week I was driving my daughter to a friends house and there was a tapping sound.  The car did not sound right.  Suddenly the engine light illuminated and was blinking.  The car smelled of gas.  Thankfully I wasn't too far from home.  I had to drive on a highway to get back to my house.  I could only go about 30 mph.  It was very dangerous.  I had my hazards on but people were still beeping at me since I was causing a safety hazard for myself and others.  I managed to get home safely and called the dealership.  I dropped my car off the next morning since it is not drive-able.  The service rep said it was going in as an emergency.  After 5 days they finally looked at it.  They did not give me a loaner.  If I wanted a loaner I was required to pay $46/day.  The rep said the repairs to my 3 year old car wont be covered and it will cost over $5,000 to fix the engine.  It is a known engine issue to Chevy corporate bulletin 15-06-01-002H Engine Misfire/tick noise, malfunction Indicator Lamp Illuminated.  It is common in 20-15-2019 Tahoe and Suburban.  I had to borrow a 12 year old car to drive around my 4 children because my 3 year old car has a bad engine.

SINCE DECEMBER 2019, I HAVE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE 2 LOCAL CERTIFIED CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS AND SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  BOTH LOCATIONS TOLD ME THE SOFTWARE IS NOT UPDATED PROPERLY THEREFORE MY VEHICLE WILL NOT EXCEPT RECALL.  AFTER MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO GET THE RECALL FIXED AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, I CONTACTED CHEVROLET DIRECTLY AND A CASE NUMBER WAS ISSUED (SERVICE REQUEST NUMBER: 9-5847462774).  I COMMUNICATED FREQUENTLY WITH CHEVROLET ON RESOLVING THE RECALL ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE.  THE END RESULT, I WAS TOLD BY CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THE ISSUE IS UNABLE TO BE REPAIRED AND THE RECALL COULD NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT CHEVROLET NEEDED AND THEY WERE UNCERTAIN IF/WHEN THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WOULD BE AVAILABLE. SINCE THE CASE WITH CHEVROLET HAS BEEN OPENED, I HAVE TAKEN MY SUV TO ANOTHER CERTIFIED CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON 2 OTHER OCCASIONS AND THE RECALL HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.   AFTER THE 3RD TIME I HAVE TAKEN MY SUV IN FOR THIS RECALL, I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN VIA EMAIL AND I HAVE GOTTEN NO REPLY BACK OR RETURN PHONE CALL. IS THIS HOW A PERSON, WITH A FAMILY, THAT HAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND A RECALL ON A VEHICLE SHOULD BE TREATED? ESPECIALLY, WHEN THE VACUUM LINE FOR THE BRAKES IN MY CHEVROLET TAHOE KNOWINGLY DO NOT SEAL AND THE BRAKES DO NOT OPERATE AS INTENDED.",

IT WAS FURTHER COMMENTED BY BOTH THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AT GMC, THAT THIS WILL NOT ADDRESS ALL VEHICLES IDENTIFIED IN THIS RECALL, MEANING MORE ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED TO FIX THE UNDERLINING ISSUE. IN THIS CASE, SEVERAL COMPONENTS WERE NEEDED TO BE PHYSICAL REPLACED, NAMELY THE VACUUM PUMP.

THEN AS I WAS WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN IN TRAFFIC, MY VEHICLE STALLED THEN ALLOWED ME TO GO. THEN SUDDENLY MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I THEN RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE ONSTAR NOTIFICATION STATING THE DIAGNOSTIC DETECTED AN ISSUE WITH MY ENGINE AND MY TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN MONDAY 07/17/17 MORNING AT 11 AM. THE SERVICE MAN INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE BRAND-NEW VEHICLES BY THE DEALERSHIP AND GENERAL MOTORS BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE HEAT IN LAS VEGAS, BUT THERE WAS NO RECALL IN PLACE FOR GENERAL MOTORS AND A LETTER WAS ISSUED DATED JUNE 30, 2017 THAT HE HAD TO PROVIDE TO ME BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SOLUTION TO FIX THE PROBLEM AT THIS TIME.  HE LET ME THAT GENERAL MOTORS HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO FIX ON THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE EXTREME HEAT. I ASKED WHY WAS THIS NOT DISCLOSE TO ME BEFORE LEASING ME THE VEHICLE IF THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE TO ALLOW ME THE CHOICE TO DECIDE IF THIS WAS SOMETHING I COULD TOLERATE. THE SALES REP NOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WERE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER OF ED BOZARTH CHEVROLET AND WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD NEED TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 24ONCE HE RETURNS FROM VACATION. I LET THE SALES REP KNOW THAT I WAS UNHAPPY, I WAS DECEIVED AND I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.
