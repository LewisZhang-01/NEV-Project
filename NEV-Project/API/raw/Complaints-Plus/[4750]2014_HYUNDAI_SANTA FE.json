        "summary": "I purchased a used 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe in 2020 which had 60,000 miles on it and in fairly good condition.  In November 2021 I was driving on the highway going around 65 mph and the engine suddenly died and I was unable to continue accelerating. I was barely able to swerve into the breakdown down without getting in an accident however it was a very dangerous and stressful situation to be in.  I took the vehicle to a dealership and they said the entire engine needs to be replaced which will cost roughly $7500.   I believe a recall is definitely needed on the 2014 Hyundai because they have engine issues just like prior models had, which were recalled. I checked the National Highway Traffic Safety incident database and found many other people had this same engine issue with the 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe. These models are very unsafe and could potentially cause serious problems for other drivers.",

We're to wait 3-5 business days to determine if Hyundai will approve or deny the claim. It's hard to imagine they will based off of us being the original owners and receipts indicating all required maintenance. We're also expecting to have Hyundai to pay for a rental vehicle since there are no loaners available.",

        "summary": "On December 31, 2021, at approximately 12:30pm CST, I was driving my fathers 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe down I-94 in Michigan City/ LaPorte area of Indiana. In the vehicle was my father, my wife and my brother. I was driving at approximately 70-75 mph and I started hearing a rattling noise when I accelerated. It sounded as if the vehicle had a loose heat shield on the exhaust, so I didn't think too much of it. About 45-60 seconds after that, all the dash lights came on and I pulled off to the side of the highway. I turned the vehicle off and waited about 30 seconds and tried to start it back up, which it did not do. I then noticed smoke coming from under the hood, so I told everyone to get out of the vehicle and I popped the hood latch. I opened the hood and tried to determine where the smoke was coming from, however it was coming from under other parts in the engine, so I could determine what exactly was smoking. I then saw a flame. I told everyone to get back and I immediately called 911. Within 10-15 minutes, a firefighter pulled up in a pick-up truck. He assessed the situation and spoke with my father. Ten minutes after that, other firefighters showed up with an engine and extinguished the fire. By that time though, the fire had completely engulfed the entire front end of the vehicle. We spoke with the police officers after a short wait, a tow truck came and picked up the vehicle and we were picked up by other family members.",

One or more cylinders began to misfire while climbing a hill with many other cars and trucks in the slower lane to avoid.  The engine light was flickering and depending on the position of the accelerator would go on and off.  The car began shaking rather violently, but I couldn't pull over so others needed to avoid me.  I coasted down a hill and made it off an exit ramp.  Then engine had no power at this point and was still shaking.  I checked the oil and found it had burned nearly 1 qt. in 100 miles.  I noticed nearly all the oil was gone on the prior oil change and thought the mechanic had not put enough in.  I now think there is something dangerously wrong with these engines consuming oil.   The engine light has been coming on for a while and the dealerships or others I had read the codes normally indicated cylinder 3 contribution.  This was never solved as it would come back on after a few months from having it worked on.  The dealership still has the car and stated that cylinder 1, 3, & 4 had misfire codes and that 1& 3 plugs were coated in oil.   After cleaning the engine and doing compression tests it appears the engine is destroyed.  I'm glad the engine didn't lock up and I can only image what would have happened had I been able to continue on that trip and it consumed all its oil while driving.

This amount is a little more than the car is worth.  I was told that the current recall for this same issue is only for the Sante Fe Sport which is a the 4 cylinder engine and the Limited is v6.

I\u2019m reaching out AGAIN demanding investigations EVERY FAILED ENGINE REPORTED. Denying accountability For the safety of their customers! My engine blew driving onI-40 interstate. I was accelerating to pass a vehicle. During my attempted acceleration I lost all petal pressure and my foot went to the floor. The RPM\u2019s spiked up 5-6k. the oil pressure escalated rapidly. My car seemingly stalled out. Losing ability to keep moving. What looked like steam coming out of the passenger side front wheel well. Assumed that was from a liquid hitting the hot brakes. After sitting for a few moments, I attempted to restart the vehicle. turning it off & it never came back on. Following failure to start back up. I checked the oil level. ALARMINGLY- it was completely dry. While inspecting the car on the side of the busiest highway! there was no large apparent leaks,where the oil would\u2019ve run out. This is a direct display of the motor burning the oil over time. The Hyuandi dealership is responsible for the maintenance and my cars inability to run. As the oil\u2019s mysterious disappearance is from a malfunction in the engine. the REASON my car ran out of oil. MONTHS prior to its mysterious disappearance the oil was changed & NO concerns of malfunction or failure to run, we\u2019re reported after my maintenance by the SAME dealership who blames me. Denying the truth. Blaming me for \u201clack of servicing\u201d the vehicle they serviced AND WAS NOT DUE OF ONE. Hyuandi\u2019s ignoring their engine problem. Putting their customers and many other drivers lives AT RISK. and I\u2019m highly disappointed in the service from both hyuandi, all dealerships, and the refusal to acknowledge THEIR responsibility for ME NO LONGER HAVING A RUNNING VEHICLE.

I thought it was a one time noise.  The clicking noise is more constant, when making a turn while the car is in motion. Sometimes the steering wheel feels 'loose' or uncontrollable.  I believe it is the steering wheel or coupler.  I am concerned for my safety and other drivers.  Hearing this clicking constantly, sounds like the steering wheel is going to break. It is annoying!

AT THIS TIME, IT IS STARTING TO DO THE SAME THING. AFTER READING THIS ARTICLE, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE ENGINE FAILURE IN THE FUTURE NOW THAT MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED WITH THE MANUFACTURER. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY VEHICLE INCLUDED IN ANY FUTURE RECALLS (THERE IS NOT ONE NOW) THAT MAY INVOLVE THIS SPECIFIC MOTOR AND VEHICLE. ALSO, I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE SUNROOF, THE ENTERTAINMENT ELECTRONICS, AND AC/HEATING ELECTRICAL CAB CONTROLS. MANY ERROR MESSAGES ARE WRITTEN IN THE HYUNDAI LANGUAGE. THE DEALER STATED THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE OUT THE ONBOARD COMPUTER FOR A LIST PRICE OF $2,600.00. THE SECOND-ROW SEAT HEATERS HAVE FAILED AFTER THE WARRANTY AND HAVE HARDLY EVER BEEN USED. DEALER WANTED OVER $600 PLUS LABOR TO REPLACE EACH SEAT.",

I DECIDED TO TAKE ON THE REPAIR MYSELF WHICH HYUNDAI TOLD ME WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

THE DEALER AND CORPORATE BOTH, TOLD ME TO TOW MY VEHICLE TO A 3RD PARTY MECHANIC TO MEASURE THE BEARINGS, THEN TOW MY CAR BACK HOME, THEN GIVE HYUNDAI THE MEASUREMENT TO GET A PART NUMBER.

I NOTE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CANADA ONLY RECALL OF 2013 HYUNDAI SANTA FES FOR RISK OF FIRE WHEN SALT GRIME ENTERS THE REAR PARKING SENSORS (WHICH MY VEHICLE HAD) AND SHORT CIRCUITS - IT APPEARS THE RISK OF FIRE DUE TO THIS ISSUE CAN OCCUR WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED AND OFF.  FORTUNATELY, NOBODY WAS HURT AND ONLY MY PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS IMPACTED - THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE IF THE CAR WAS PARKED IN MY HOUSE GARAGE, A HOTEL GARAGE, WHILE DRIVING, ETC.  A THREE YEAR OLD CAR BURNING FOR NO APPARENT REASON, SEEMS LIKE A POTENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY RISK, AND SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A CAR OF ANY AGE.  HAPPENED IN A SMALL RURAL AREA - NO FIRE DEPT REPORT, POLICE SAID THEY WOULD WRITE A REPORT BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED.  THE CAR IS CONSIDERED A WRITE-OFF BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY.
