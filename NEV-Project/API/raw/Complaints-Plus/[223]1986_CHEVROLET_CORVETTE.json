OUR 1986 CORVETTE'S SEATBELTS INTERMITTENTLY LOCKUP AND DO NOT MOVE; THEN WHEN THEY DO EVENTUALLY RELEASE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY DO NOT CONSISTENTLY GRAB WHEN NEEDED.  AFTER ONE RECENT QUICK STOP THE PASSENGER BELT DID NOT RESTRAIN.  THAT EXPERIENCE PROMPTED US TO SEARCH ONLINE FOR REPLACEMENT SEATBELTS.  DURING THAT SEARCH WE FOUND A RECALL NOTICE, SO WE CHECKED OUR OWN RECORDS AND FOUND THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE THAT CHEVROLET MAILED TO US IN 1991, AND AN APRIL 1991 NOTE THAT THEY REFUSED TO PERFORM THE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE ALL OF THE VEHICLE?S SERVICE RECORDS AND THERE IS NO RECORD, OR RECOLLECTION, THAT THE REPAIR WAS EVER PERFORMED.      WE CALLED CHEVROLET?S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LEARNED THAT ONE DATABASE SHOWS THAT OUR 1986 CORVETTE IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE REPAIR, BUT ANOTHER DATABASE (OPEN RECALL DATABASE?) DOES NOT SHOW OUR VIN# SO THEY WON?T PERFORM THE REPAIR.  IN JUNE 2014 A LOCAL DEALER, WHO ALSO REFUSED TO PERFORM THE RECALL SERVICE,  SURMISED THAT OUR VIN# DOES NOT APPEAR BECAUSE IN APRIL 1992, WHEN THE RECALL SERVICE WAS ORIGINALLY REFUSED, THE DEALER PROBABLY REMOVED IT FROM THE RECALL DATABASE (BUT WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS NOR DOES CHEVROLET HAVE ANY RECORD OF IT.)  OF COURSE THE MISSING VIN# MIGHT ALSO BE A DATA ACCURACY PROBLEM WITH CHEVROLET?S DATABASE.      ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO ADVISE/ENCOURAGE CHEVROLET TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE SEAT BELTS?     IF NOT, AT LEAST FILE THIS AS A SAFETY COMPLAINT AGAINST CHEVROLET.  THANK YOU.    PS:  WE HAVE A LOG OF ALL CALLS TO GM AND PICTURES OF THE SEAT BELT SERIAL NUMBERS.
