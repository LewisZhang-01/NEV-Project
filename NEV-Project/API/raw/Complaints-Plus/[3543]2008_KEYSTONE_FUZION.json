THEN UPON RETURNING BACK HOME ON JULY 19, 2009 WE HAD ANOTHER TIRE BLOW OUT ON THE SAME SIDE OF OUR FIFTH WHEEL, THIS TIME THE OTHER TIRE WENT AND WE HAD NO SPARE BECAUSE IT WAS ON OUR RV ALREADY. THE TIRE ARE JUST OVER A YEAR OLD AND THEY DON'T HAVE MORE THAN 2500 MILES ON THEM. WE HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW TIRE FROM THE ROADSIDE SERVICE THAT CAME AND HE LOOKED AT OUR REMAINING TWO TIRES ON THE LEFT SIDE AND SAID WE BETTER REPLACE THEM BEFORE OUR NEXT TRIP AND THEY WERE NOT GOOD TIRES. THE BLOW OUT HAPPENED ON I-15 IN UTAH AND ON STATE ROAD 28 IN UTAH BY LEVAN. THE BLOWOUT HAPPENED ON THE RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE OF OUR RV ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS.  THE SECOND BLOWOUT CAUSED DAMAGE TO OUR FIFTH WHEEL, IT TORE OF THE METAL SIDE WALL, BUSTED A LIGHT, DAMAGED THE GAS LINE AND THE UNDER OR BOTTOM WALL OF OUR FIFTH WHEEL. WE ARE WORRIED THAT THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT LOOKED INTO. WE FIND IT ODD THAT WE HAD TWO BLOWOUT IN THE SAME TRIP.    THANK YOU,  SHANE AND WENDY MURRAY *TR",
