AFTER STALLING A 3RD TIME AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS MISREADING THE FUEL LEVEL AND LUCKILY I HAD PURCHASED A GAS JUG TO CARRY IN MY TRUNK AT ALL TIMES. INFINITI REFUSED TO GIVE ME A FREE EVALUATION, $140 COST, AND I ENDED UP HAVING THE SENDING UNIT REPLACED 700$ PLUS IN REPAIR. AFTER ALL THIS THE CAR HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS. DURING THESE TIMES IN STALLED I WAS ON A MAJOR BRIDGE IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY.  IN PANIC I TRIED TO GET ONTO THE SHOULDER AND FEEL MY CAR SEAT MY ALSO BE OFF-ALIGNMENT NOW DUE TO TRYING TO JERK MY BODY AROUND TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING ON THE BRIDGE WHEN MY CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED. I NOW HAVE A CAR THAT STILL NEEDS A NEAR INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, AND MAYBE A BROKEN DRIVER'S SEAT.  I SPEND APPROX. $1200-$1500 IN TOWING/REPAIRS/GAS AND MANY MORE IN HEADACHES.TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE WHEN I STALLED I HAD TO LEAVE MY CAR FOR HOURS IN A PARKING LOT UNTIL I COULD GET GAS OR A TOW, AND A ROCK HIT MY WINDSHIELD FROM THE BRIDGE ABOVE AND NOW HAVE A CRACKED. INFINITI HAS TAKEN NO RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MANNER AND AFTER SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY (AN ADDITIONAL $100 FOR A USED TEMPORARY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND $140 FOR THE ESTIMATE AT THE DEALERSHIP), I STILL HAVE A CAR THAT NEEDS A NEW INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, WINDSHIELD, AND PROBABLY A DRIVER SEAT PART THAT CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN OFFER A DISCOUNT FOR REPAIRS.NOW, I CAN'T SELL THE CAR MORALLY WITHOUT TELLING THE BUYER OF THE ISSUES.  I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE VEHICLE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ....  I FEEL THAT 2003-2004 INFINITI M45 OWNERS ARE BEING PUNISHED BECAUSE THIS CAR WAS ONLY MADE FOR 2 YEARS AND BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PRICE TAG THERE AREN'T AS MANY SOLD IN THE US.  THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS ISN'T A HUGE ISSUE.  *TR",
