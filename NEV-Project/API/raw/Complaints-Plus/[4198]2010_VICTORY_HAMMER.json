        "summary": "I RODE THE BIKE 3-4 TIMES (~ 120 MI.) AFTER HAVING WORK DONE AT ON 4/29/2010. THE SECOND WEEK OF AUGUST 2011, I TURNED ON THE KEY TO START THE BIKE AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS POURED FROM UNDER THE GAS TANK.  I REMOVED THE TANK, CHECKED THE HOSE CONNECTION, COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG AND REPLACED THE TANK.  TURNED ON THE KEY AGAIN AND AGAIN GAS POURED FROM UNDER THE TANK. THEN I REMOVED THE TANK AGAIN AND FOUND THE NIPPLE FROM THE FUEL PUMP BROKEN OFF IN THE HOSE.      THE FUEL PUMP NIPPLE IS NOT VISIBLE UNLESS THE HOSE IS REMOVED. THE FUEL PUMP CYCLES ONCE WHEN THE IGNITION IS TURNED ON. THE GAS TANK FITS SNUGLY, IT IS UNWIELDY (ESPECIALLY WHEN FULL) AND IT IS EASY TO BUMP THE HOSE/NIPPLE AGAINST THE FRAME OR OTHER COMPONENTS WHEN REMOVING AND REINSTALLING THE TANK.    APPARENTLY, THE NIPPLE WAS CRACKED DURING THE WORK AT  THEN GRADUALLY ENLARGED DUE TO ROAD/ENGINE VIBRATIONS.  MY TANK REMOVALS AND REINSTALLATIONS PROBABLY FINALLY COMPLETED THE CRACK.   I EXPLAINED THESE EVENTS TO AND WAS TOLD THEY ALSO HAD TO REPLACE A FUEL PUMP BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE NIPPLE (IT BROKE COMPLETELY WHILE IN THEIR GARAGE).  SO I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT FUEL PUMP: IT HAD A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER NIPPLE AND HOSE AND THE FUEL PUMP/NIPPLE PLASTIC MATERIAL COMPOSITION WAS DIFFERENT. SO, POLARIS RECOGNIZES THE INADEQUACY OF THE FUEL PUMP NIPPLE AND HAS REDESIGNED IT TO BE SAFER.    IF THE ENGINE HAD BEEN HOT/RUNNING WHEN THE GAS STARTED LEAKING, I COULD HAVE BEEN BURNED SEVERELY; IF RIDING, I COULD HAVE CRASHED. MANY, IF NOT MOST, MOTORCYCLE OWNERS MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND/OR ADD ACCESSORIES TO THEIR MOTORCYCLES THEMSELVES. THE FRAGILE FUEL PUMP NIPPLE IS DANGEROUS. PLEASE HAVE IT RECALLED.
