I pull into my garage, or a parking space, etc and put the car in PARK, the dashboard shows a P for Park but it also shows a message that says car needs to be in park in order to shut off (something a long these lines\u2026) so I have to jiggle it for a few seconds for it to register that it\u2019s in park. It also starts paddle shifting by itself while I am driving!!! I believe what is happening is related to the existing recalls (20V692000 & 14V393000) on  Edge\u2019s, but does not include my VIN.

I WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO COAST ACROSS THE INTERSECTION IN TIME TO PULL OVER SAFELY.  ONCE I WAS STOPPED THE CAR FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO CALL ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE, I STARTED THE ENGINE AGAIN, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL.  I TRIED TO DRIVE IT FURTHER, BUT AFTER ABOUT 20 MILES, IT STALLED AGAIN THE SAME WAY.  AGAIN, I PULLED OVER AND TURNED IT OFF, AND IT SEEMED TO WORK WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON.  ONCE IT STALLED FOR A THIRD TIME, I HAD TO PULL OVER AND HAVE IT TOWED.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM OTHER DRIVERS ARE FACING WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL, AND IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THE VEHICLE GAVE NO WARNING THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG (LIKE AN INDICATOR LIGHT IN ADVANCE OR EVEN A STRANGE NOISE) BEFORE IT STALLED, AND I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM FORD ABOUT THIS SAFETY ISSUE OF WHICH FORD SEEMS TO BE AWARE.",
