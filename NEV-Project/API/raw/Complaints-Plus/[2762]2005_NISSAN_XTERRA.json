UNTIL IT WENT OVER 90,000 MILES IN FEB. 2014, THE TRANSMISSION JUST STOPPED AND WENT INTO NEUTRAL WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED IN THE FAST LANE ON A BUSY INTERSTATE HIGHWAY. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO PASS OVER THE OTHER LANES OF TRAFFIC AND MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER BEFORE THE CAR ROLLED TO A COMPLETE STOP.

THEY \"SERVICED\" THE COOLING SYSTEM BY REPLACING THE RADIATOR HOSES AND CLAMPS AND FLUSHING THE SYSTEM OUT AND TELLING ME THAT THAT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM. (AT MY EXPENSE OF COURSE) THEY CHECKED THE TRANSMISSION AND SAID THAT IT WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY WITH NO PROBLEMS. FINE.  2 YEARS AND 6,000 MILES LATER WHILE DRIVING  AT HIGHWAY SPEED ON A LOS ANGELES FREEWAY (IT IS SOMETIMES POSSIBLE) THE TRANSMISSION SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AND SWITCHES INTO NEUTRAL LEAVING ME TRYING TO AND WEAVE MY WAY TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY WHERE THERE IS A SHOULDER BEFORE I LOOSE MOMENTUM.

LUCKILY NONE OF  THESE HAVE CAUSED ANY REAL SAFETY CONCERN BUT I WANT IT DOCUMENTED THAT NISSAN IS SELLING A VEHICLE WITH A POORLY MADE CLUTCH THAT COULD CAUSE SAFETY ISSUE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURS. IF A VEHICLE LOSES ITS CLUTCH IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SHIFT GEARS OR LOSE MOTIVE POWER INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.",

I OWN A 2005 X-TERRA AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS YEAR THAT I HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH MY CAR.  IT STARTED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN MY CAR SIMPLY STALLED IN A PARKING LOT.  AFTER SPENDING MORE THAN $200 IN TOWING PLUS $1500 IN FIXING THE TRANSMISSION COMPUTER I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  IN MAY, DRIVING BACK FROM TAMPA TO MIAMI, THE CAR STARTED TO ACT AGAIN BUT THEN IT WENT AWAY.  ABOUT A MONTH AGO MY CAR HAD ANOTHER EPISODE OF 'LOOSING' POWER. I BROUGHT MY CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER IN MIAMI FOR THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AND THEY SUGGESTED TAKING IT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AS THEIR PROTOCOL FOR CASES LIKE THIS CALLS FOR AN EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION CHANGE.     THE WEEKEND OF OCTOBER 7TH, I WAS HEADED TOWARDS MY PARENTS HOME AND MY CAR STALLED AGAIN.  I TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST IN CORAL SPRINGS AND $4,600 LATER, I HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR.  HE GAVE ME THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE RADIATOR LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION.  MY BROTHER POINTED TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT WITH NISSAN REGARDING THIS SAME ISSUE.

I PULLED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED TO NOT BE RUNNING.  I TOWED THE CAR TO A MECHANIC AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE CAR THAT NISSAN HAS ACKNOWLEDGED BUT DID NOT RECALL THE VEHICLES.  I FIND MYSELF WITH A $6,000 REPAIR ESTIMATE. I CALLED THE DEALER AFTER FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED MY CAR TO DIE AND THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL AND INFORMED ME THAT NISSAN HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR WITH A $3,000 CO-PAY. THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR BUT A REAL DANGER IF THE CAR GOES INTO REVERSE  WHILE ON HEAVY, FAST TRAFFIC.  I'M COMPLETELY AGHAST THAT NISSAN AND THE DEALERS HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT HAVE NOT NOTIFIED CAR OWNERS NOR WILL THEY OWN UP TO THE DESIGN DEFECT AND REPAIR THE VEHICLES WHICH SHOULD NOT BE NEEDING NEW TRANSMISSIONS WITH LESS THAN 100,000 OF DRIVING.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THESE COMPLAINTS, BUT NISSAN NEEDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPAIR THE VEHICLES FREE OF CHARGE. THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT THEY SETTLED IS A SHAM.

I HAVE HAD EVERY RECALL PART FOR THIS VEHICLE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO FAULTY MANUFACTURING,  THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR AND IT HAS BEEN KNOWN DUE TO THE # OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PART BEING FAULTY BUT A RECALL NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF NISSAN.  I AM EXPECTED TO COVER THIS WITH A DEDUCTIBLE OF $2500.00 AT NO FAULT OF MY OWN .  I AM LUCKY TO BE  ALIVE.  I HAVE MAINTAINED ALL NECESSARY/RECCOMENDED SERVICE OUTLINED BY NISSAN UP TILL L THIS FAILURE.  THANK YOU",

THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THIS FIXED KNOWING THAT THIS IS A DEFECT ON THE VEHICLE THAT NISSAN HAS KNOWN ABOUT AS IT EFFECTS 2005-2010 XTERRA'S, PATHFINDERS AND FRONTIERS.

HE PROCEEDED VERY SLOWLY FOR A SHORT DISTANCE UNTIL HE WOULD LOSE ACCELERATION POWER. HE HAD TO CONTINUE TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND ON  THE HIGHWAY MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET IT HOME THAT EVENING. HE CONTINUED VERY SLOWLY WITH HIS FLASHING LIGHTS ON. IT SUBSEQUENTLY HAD TO BE TOWED.   THANKFULLY, IT DID NOT RESULT IN A CRASH ON THE INTERSTATE. THE CAR IS BLACK AND IT WAS VERY DARK. IT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM TO REACT ON THE INTERSTATE. MY SON'S SAFETY WAS SEVERELY COMPROMISED.  THE PROBLEM TURNED OUT TO BE THE RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION PROBLEM NISSAN IS ALREADY BEING INVESTIGATED FOR (NHTSA ACTION NUMBER DP12004). IT REQUIRED A NEW RADIATOR, A NEW TRANSMISSION AND A NEW TRANSMISSION COMPUTER AS THIS WAS ALL RUINED WITH THE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE RADIATOR. THE COST OF REPAIRS WAS $4632.97 INCLUDING THE TOW CHARGE. NISSAN HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND EVEN SETTLED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS VERY ISSUE A FEW YEARS AGO. HAD THEY VOLUNTARILY RECALLED THE VEHICLE AND FIXED THE PROBLEM, MY SON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION AND THE COSTS WOULD HAVE BEEN MINIMIZED.

THE NISSAN SERVICE/DEALER IN KINGSTON MA WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE TRIED TO TELL US ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS A RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION FLUSH BUT WE HAD ALREADY CONTACTED NISSAN CORPORATE AND FOUND OUT WE WERE ENTITLED TO A NEW TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR ASSEMBLY DUE TO A RECALL.

THE EXTENDED WARRANTY DID NOT ADVISE OWNERS TO REPLACE THE PROBLEM SENDING UNITS, IT JUST PROVIDED FOR REPAIRS IF AND WHEN, SUBJECT TO MILEAGE AND TIME LIMITS, THE VEHICLE MANIFESTED THE SENDING UNIT PROBLEM.

FAULTY FUEL QUANTITY READINGS ARE NOT JUST AN INCONVENIENCE.

I QUICKLY SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT A NISSAN DEALER AND IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT, I GOOGLED 2005 NISSAN XTERRA, RUMBLE STRIP.  LITERALLY DOZENS OF WEB PAGES POPPED UP REVEALING THAT A DEFECT IN THE RADIATOR WAS CAUSING COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE TRANSMISSION, THEREBY RUINING THE TRANSMISSION/RADIATOR.  THE TESTIMONIALS DETAILED MY EXACT EXPERIENCE AND ALSO DESCRIBED INSTANCES WHERE TRANSMISSIONS WOULD LOCK-UP WHILE DRIVING.    I RAISED MY SUSPICIONS TO COCHRAN NISSAN IN PITTSBURGH, PA, AND THEY PERFORMED A FULL SERVICE CHECK WHICH CONFIRMED THAT COOLANT HAD LEAKED INTO MY TRANSMISSION.  COCHRAN EXPLAINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SALVAGEABLE, BUT THAT THE RADIATOR NEEDED REPLACED WHICH I LATER FOUND OUT HAD ITS WARRANTY EXTENDED TO 80,000 MILES.  THE PROBLEM WAS, HOWEVER, THAT MY XTERRA CURRENTLY HAD 101,000 MILES, MAKING ME A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY OF NO BENEFIT TO ME.  COCHARAN REPLACED THE RADIATOR AND FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $830.00.      NOW IN FEBRUARY 2013 AGAIN AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING (OUR TWO KIDS), THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPED CAUSING THE XTERRA TO STALL AND LOCK UP AND AGAIN I AM LOOKING AT A SUBSTANTIAL REPAIR COSTING WELL ABOVE THE $830 PREVIOUSLY PAID.  NISSAN HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION FOR YEARS (POSSIBLY 2007) AND HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  DAMAGE RESULTING FROM A DESIGN DEFECT IS NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE FROM THE OWNER COULD RECTIFY.  SELLING A PRODUCT WITH DESIGN AND/OR MANUFACTURING DEFECTS TO UNSUSPECTING BUYERS THAT PLACES PERSONS IN DANGER IS UNETHICAL AND NISSAN SHOULD BE FORCED TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT AND TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

NEXT DAY I DROVE THE TRUCK TO NISSAN DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFECT IN THE RADIATOR THE ANTI-FREEZE WAS LEAKING TO THE TRANSMISSION AND CAUSING IT TO SEIZE AND BOTH COMPONENTS NEED TO IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE FAILURE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THAT IS OCCURS WITH NO WARNING, NO ENGINE LIGHT, NO NOTICEABLE DETERIORATION OF PERFORMANCE, IT JUST HAPPENS. SINCE I WAS NOT IN ANY POSITION TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR, I TOOK MY TRUCK HOME AND TRY TO CONTACT NISSAN FOR HELP. ON JANUARY 16, I CONTACT THE NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AGAIN AND REQUESTED AN EXCEPTION TO THE 80K MILES LIMITATION. NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS TOOK 2 WEEKS TO REVIEW MY CASE BEFORE DENYING IT. THE FAILURE OF NISSAN TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PROBLEM REPRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DESIGN FLAW, IS INEXCUSABLE. NISSAN DENIES THAT THERE IS A SAFETY CONCERN, WHEREAS THEY SHOULD HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ERROR AND ISSUED A RECALL. HOW MANY ACCIDENTS OR FATALITIES NEED TO OCCUR OVER THE COMING YEARS BEFORE NISSAN IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE? MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER ESTIMATED IT WOULD COST $5368 TO REPAIR MY XTERRA. THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN AND HARDSHIP -- ESPECIALLY ON A VEHICLE WITH JUST OVER 100K MILES. HOW MANY NISSAN OWNERS HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIP BEFORE NISSAN IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE?   *TR",

AFTER SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE, I FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROBLEM IS PLAGUING MANY OTHER OWNERS OF NISSAN XTERRA, PATHFINDER FROM 2005-2010. NISSAN HAS ISSUED A RECALL ON THIS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FROM 60K TO 80K. HOWEVER I HAVE NOT YET FOUND ONE OWNER THAT DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING BEFORE 80K. AS FAR AS I SEE IT IS NISSAN TRYING TO HIDE THE FACE THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY RECALL. I JUST CAME FROM NISSAN DEALER AND THEY GAVE ME AN ESTEEMED OF $4925.73 TO FIX THE TRANNY & THE RADIATOR. I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN AND THEY HAVE DECIDED NOT TO HELP ME IN THIS MATTER. SO I HAVE NOW HAVE A TRUCK THAT I CAN'T DRIVE OR CAN AFFORD TO FIX. I AM GOING TO LOOK IN TO OTHER OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEMS. I WILL FIGHT THIS TO THE END.  *TR",

THEY HAD AN ADJUSTOR FROM CAREFREE CAR PROTECTION COME OUT TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE ON FRIDAY NOVEMBER 11, 2011.  WITH THAT BEING SAID; THEY STATED THEY DO NOT COVER THE RADIATOR ISSUE; AND SINCE IT WAS THE FAULTY RADIATOR THAT CAUSED THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL AND ULTIMATELY SEIZED, THEY WILL ALSO NOT COVER THAT OR ANY OTHER OF THE REPAIRS.  UPON A BIT OF RESEARCH ON MY OWN THIS IS A KNOWN FAILURE WITH THIS PARTICULAR YEAR/MAKE/MODEL OF NISSAN.  THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTED CASES OF CONSUMERS WITH THE VERY SAME ISSUE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL MADE ON THIS AT ALL.  YES, NISSAN EXTENDED THE RADIATOR WARRANTY UP TO 80,000 MILES BUT NOT THE TRANSMISSION.  GUESS WHAT; THIS HAPPENED IN MY VEHICLE AT 89,000, SO NOT ONLY CAN I NOT FIX THE RADIATOR ISSUE BUT THE TRANSMISSION IS ALSO THE SAME.      THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS; ON WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 9TH MY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I WERE ALMOST KILLED DUE TO THIS KNOWN MALFUNCTION.

A NUMBER OF FOLKS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE...NISSAN HAS EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED A PROBLEM AND HAS EXTENDED THEIR WARRANTY ON THE RADIATOR, BUT NOT THE TORQUE CONVERTER, BUT MY MILEAGE EXCEEDS THE EXTENDED PERIOD; IF THEY KNOW OF THE ISSUE, WHY ISN'T THERE A RE-CALL...IF THE TORQUE CONVERTER FAILS WHILE DRIVING, IT WILL MOST CERTAINLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT...PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE AND MORE FREQUENT...THERE NEEDS TO BE ACTION BY NISSAN TO CORRECT THIS CONDITION BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED DUE TO A KNOWN PROBLEM...  *TR",

I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TWICE, INCLUDING A TOW TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN SANTA MONICA.  THE INCIDENT BEGAN IN APRIL 2010.    IN MAY 2010, THE NISSAN DEALER IN SANTA MONICA CHECKED THE PROBLEM AND INDICATED THAT THE IPDM HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  SHORTLY AFTER THE IPDM WAS REPLACED, 1 OF 2  CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IN THE XTERRA FAILED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  6 MONTHS LATER (DECEMBER 2010), THE OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER FAILED.  I BELIEVE THE IPDM ISSUE IS SEVERE.      I BELIEVE THE IPDM ISSUE IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH (AND LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF) THE FAILURE OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IN THE VEHICLE.

SINCE THEY WOULDN'T HELP ME, MY LIGHT WAS ON LONG BEFORE I HIT 72,000 MILES, AND THIS IS SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM IN THESE VEHICLES, I FEEL STRONGLY THAT NISSAN SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL. I HAVE HIGH MILEAGE ON MY CAR BECAUSE MY FAMILY LIVES 6 HOURS AWAY AND I DRIVE TO SEE THEM FREQUENTLY.  IS THERE ANY THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME?  PLEASE?  *TR",

ON MY NEXT TRIP TO THE GAS STATION, UPON  REFILLING THE GAS TANK, MY GAUGE ONLY READ A HALF TANK. UPON MY NEXT TRIP IN THE VEHICLE, THE GAUGE READ PROPERLY. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT TRIPS THE GAUGE READ SOMETIMES MORE THAN IT SHOULD AND SOMETIMES LESS THAN IT SHOULD. FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER GOING 78 MILES THE GAUGE STILL READ \"FULL\", AND THEN AFTER GOING 96 MILES THE GAUGE READ \"HALF FULL\".    AFTER REFILLING THE GAS TANK THIS LAST TIME, THE GAUGE READ 3/4 OF A TANK. THE NEXT TRIP THE GAUGE READ \"FULL\". SUBSEQUENT TRIPS THE GAUGE READS SOMETIMES MORE THAN IT SHOULD AND SOMETIMES LESS THAN IT SHOULD. THE LAST COUPLE OF TRIPS THE GAUGE SHOWED THE SAME AMOUNT EACH TIME EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DRIVEN MORE THAN 60 MILES.    I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST NISSAN DEALER (WHERE I'VE HAD SERVICE PERFORMED BEFORE) TO CHECK FOR A RECALL AS I HAD HEARD THERE WERE VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME ISSUE. APPARENTLY, NISSAN HAS ISSUED THE RECALL FOR \"SOME\" MODELS AND YEARS BUT NOT FOR MINE. THEY OFFERED TO \"DIAGNOSE\" THE PROBLEM, FOR THEIR USUAL SHOP FEE NATURALLY.    YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MODEL YEARS ALLOWED IN THE RECALL. I HAVE BEEN READING ON ONLINE FORUM WITH MANY 2005 XTERRAS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SAME ISSUE.    I AM LESS THAN PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO DIAGNOSE A KNOWN PROBLEM; MUCH LESS PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED.    I AM ISSUING THIS COMPLAINT IN HOPES THAT YOU WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND REALIZE THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM AND INCLUDE THE 2005 MODEL YEAR IN THE EXISTING RECALL. *TR",

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALER  ON MONDAY AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT THE TRANSMISSION BUT THE IPDM.  IT WORKED FOR THEM FINE AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME FINE.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE TO WORK ON TUESDAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  I MANAGED TO GET THE CAR TO MY DRIVEWAY.  ON WEDNESDAY I BARELY MADE IT TO THE NISSAN DEALER AND THE BY THE TIME I ARRIVED THE CAR WOULD NO LONGER GO IN DRIVE OR REVERSE.  I RECEIVED A CALL STATING THAT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION AND UPON FURTHER INQUIRY LEARNED THAT THE RADIATOR HAD GONE OUT AND LEAKED FLUID INTO THE TRANSMISSION - AT NO FAULT OF MY OWN.

SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON SOMETIMES TURNING OFF AND ON AT ODD TIMES.  THIS EVENT HAPPENS EVERYDAY AND I HAVE NOW RELIED ON THE TRIPOMETER TO TELL MY FUEL LEVEL.    PRIOR EVENTS LEADING TO MALFUNCTION:  I WAS DRIVING ON A 9 HOUR LONG TRIP DURING WINTER.  I WAS ABOUT 4 HOURS INTO THE TRIP AND MY FUEL GAUGE ODDLY DROPPED TO EMPTY SO I FILLED UP BUT NO CHANGE OCCURRED.  ON THE WAY UP IT STARTED TO WORK AGAIN SO I FIGURED IT WAS A FLUKE AND TRUSTED THE GAUGE.  MY CAR STALLED ABOUT 8 HOURS IN AND I HAD TO WAIT IN THE COLD FOR 2 HOURS FOR AAA.    REPAIRS MADE:  NO REPAIRS WERE MADE BUT I HAVE LOOKED FOR QUOTES ON THE REPAIR AND I KEEP GETTING DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEM.  ONE SAID THE FUEL GAUGE SENSOR NEEDS TO BE RESET (200 DOLLAR FEE) AND ANOTHER SAID THE FUEL PUMPS NEED TO BE REPLACED (700 DOLLAR FEE).    SIMILARITIES TO COMMON RECALL:  THE ISSUE I HAVE IS SO COMMON TO THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 10V075000 RECALL.  THIS RECALL IS ON THE 2006 AND 2008 NISSAN XTERRA, FRONTIER, AND PATHFINDER.  IT INVOLVES:    THE MOLDED FUEL TANK SHELLS CAN DEFORM, CAUSING THE FUEL SENDER FLOAT ARM TO CONTACT AN EMBOSSMENT MOLDED INTO THE TANK SHELL CAUSING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL FUEL GAUGE TO SHOW THAT THE VEHICLE HAS APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER TANK WHEN THE FUEL TANK IS EMPTY.    I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE 2005 XTERRA OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE, AND ONLINE THAT IS THE CONSENSUS.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WORK RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. *TR",

I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS THREADS ON THIS ISSUE IN VARIOUS ONLINE FORUMS FROM OWNERS OF 2005 AND LATER XTERRA SUVS AND FRONTIER PICK UP TRUCKS.

NISSAN HAS ISSUED A TSB AND IS AWARE THAT THE PART IS DEFECTIVE, BUT REFUSES TO CONDUCT A RECALL, EVEN THOUGH THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.  I LIVE IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND, BY NECESSITY, HAVE TO TRAVEL FAIRLY LONG DISTANCES TO GET TO \"CIVILIZATION\".

THIS PAST MONDAY THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT HAD COME ON. I THEN WENT OUT AND PURCHASED AN OBD II SCANNER TO READ THE ERROR CODE. IT WAS P0463 (FUEL LEVEL SENSOR A CIRCUIT HIGH INPUT). DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT AND FOUND THAT IT MEANS THAT I HAVE A FAULTY FUEL SENDING UNIT. IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM FOR 2005-2007 NISSAN XTERRA. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUES. IF MY WIFE IS DRIVING MY DAUGHTER BACK TO NYC AND THE CAR RUNS OUT OF FUEL AND THEY ARE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE WITH PEOPLE DRIVING PAST THEM IN EXCESS OF 70-80 MPH....
