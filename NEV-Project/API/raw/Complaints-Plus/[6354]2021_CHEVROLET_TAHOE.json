I have taken my Tahoe to the service department numerous times - as my truck has had a stubborn service safety restraint system warning error code that continues to come on and off. I have taken it to have all recalls serviced as per recall request. The service safety restraint system warning code has not been corrected after more than 5-6 visits if not more as not all visits have been logged properly.  I have had this truck for less than 12 months and have experienced too many conflicting issues. I do NOT feel safe driving my Tahoe with the SRS light on. There's obviously a malfunction that you all have not been able to figure out. This is extremely dangerous!! What if I were to get involved in an accident or collision and my airbags do not deploy? I may have a problem with the airbags themselves, a loose wire, a faulty seat belt buckle, or a problem with the engine control unit which is causing the airbag warning to come on. There is obviously a major problem.  I am putting my children and family at risk.  I have not received an email or phone call from anyone at Autonation Chevrolet. The service safety restraint system warning code has come on and off 7x since I was last at the dealership (9/10/21) and I have pictures to support.",

Since the \"module\" failure, GM has issued two additional safety recalls. In the paper notices we received for the safety recalls, GM indicates that they had been \"prompting owners through the vehicle's radio screen\" for a month, via this over-the air system, of which, ours has not been functional since late May 2021. The last of which is a power steering recall, which may result if loss of power steering functionality. Due to our inability to know the recall existed, resulting from the faulty \"over-the-air\" system, my family took a trip through the mountains only to return home to this recall notice.   GM has been unresponsive in repairing the system used to notify us safety hazards related to the vehicle that we have purchased, beyond noting that they are trying to \"get the part as soon as possible\". No one has been able to indicate what this \"part\" actually is, to date.  The possibility of this module failure, and our non-functioning module, presents a serious safety hazard to drivers with this technology who are not made aware of recalls and other safety concerns which may result in crashes and serious injury or death.",

The car was brought to the dealership the following day and I found out that this was another major engine issue. They need to order several parts, one of which is on backorder.

THE LIGHTS KNOB IS LOWER AND CLOSER TO THE CENTER COMPARED TO OTHER PREVIOUS TAHOES I HAVE OWNED MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE DRIVER'S KNEE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE LIGHTS KNOB SO THE LIGHTS CAN ACCIDENTLY BE TURNED OFF.

DRIVERS OF THIS 2021 TAHOE SHOULD BE WARNED THAT THEIR KNEE COULD TURN THEIR LIGHTS OFF AND THAT IF THAT DOES HAPPEN PULLING THE BRIGHT LEVER OR TURNING THE LIGHT KNOB BACK ON CAN CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

THIS OCCURRED ON A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY, WHERE MY VEHICLE WAS SURROUNDED BY MANY OTHER VEHICLES DRIVING AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED. IT WAS A VERY FRIGHTENING SITUATION AND I IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE HIGHWAY AND STOPPED AT THE NEAREST SAFE LOCATION, WHICH WAS A WENDY'S RESTAURANT. AT THE TIME THAT THIS SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT OCCURRED, MY BRAND NEW 2021 CHEVROLET TAHOE RST, WHICH I HAD OWNED FOR LESS THAN 6 MONTHS, HAD ONLY 5334 MILES ON IT. I CONTACTED ONSTAR AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO ISSUES DETECTED AND THAT I SHOULD \"TAKE IT EASY\" AND CONTINUE DRIVING. THE ENGINE CONTINUED SHAKING AND SPUTTERING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN STOPPED. WE WENT TO ATLANTA TO MEET WITH FAMILY AND PARKED THE CAR. THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT TO START THE CAR, IT BEGAN SHAKING AND SPUTTERING AGAIN LIKE THE ENGINE WAS GOING TO BLOW AND THE ELECTRIC PANEL ON THE CAR DISPLAYED A NUMBER OF ERRORS. I CONTACTED ONSTAR AND WAS INFORMED THERE WAS ENGINE TROUBLE AND I SHOULD TAKE THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALER. I STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY CAR BACK. I HAVE INITIATED A LEMON CLAIM WITH GM BUT THEY HAVE SAID THERE'S A BACKLOG AND HAVE NO ETA ON WHEN THIS ISSUE IS TO BE RESOLVED.
