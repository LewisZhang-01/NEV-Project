Although the 16 foot models are not covered in NHTSA Recall No. 18V-643, the failure this trailer is exhibiting is identical.  With cracks nearly the entire way through the weld connection, the trailer is at the failure point and is currently unusable since the drawbar is now expected to separate from the trailer and would likely result in a crash, property damage and personal injury/death.",
