I CONTACTED HONDA \"PRODUCT CONCERNS\" DEPARTMENT AS I EXPERIENCED EXACTLY THE SAME WHAT THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 12V486000 IS COVERING. I WANTED HONDA TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY ISSUE AND INITIATE AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS FOR MY VIN# AND PROVIDE ME WITH THEIR FINDINGS. BUT THEY TOLD ME THEY CAN REGISTER MY COMPLAINT (#N012015-03-1601127) BUT THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING AS MINE ISN'T IDENTIFIED IN AFFECTED VEHICLES UNDER CAMPAIGN ID 12V468. THE REGIONAL MANAGER OF PRODUCT CONCERNS ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW IF ANY PAST WORK WAS DONE ON MY VEHICLE THAT CAUSED THIS. I AM THE OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE SINCE MARCH 2008 AND DID NOT GET ANY WORK DONE ON MASTER SWITCH AND IT WORKED FINE UNTIL SATURDAY, MARCH 1, 2016.

WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL HONDA DOES THE DIAGNOSIS BUT AS OF NOW, THEY SEEM TO BE LEAST BOTHERED.   IN TEXAS,YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT WINDOWS WHEN A/C ISN'T WORKING. THIS VEHICLE IS ALMOST USELESS WITHOUT WINDOWS.  PLEASE INITIATE AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS WITH HONDA AND HAVE THEM LOOK INTO IT AS MY EXPERIENCE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME LISTED IN CAMPAIGN 12V486.

THE SMOKE EVENTUALLY SUBSIDED, ALTHOUGH A TERRIBLE, TOXIC-LIKE SMELL REMAINED. WE FEEL FORTUNATE THAT AT LEAST THAT I WAS ONLY BACKING OUR CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE WHEN THE SWITCH STARTED SMOKING. IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THEY FREEWAY, I COULD HAVE CRASHED.    FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, THE MWS HADN'T BEEN WORKING CORRECTLY: THE FRONT RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW COULD BE UNROLLED FROM THE MWS BUT WOULD NOT ALWAYS ROLL BACK UP FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE SWITCH. THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE AND I HAD TO PAY TO GET A NEW MWS INSTALLED ON 3/4/2010.    I AM AWARE THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS PART AND THAT OUR VIN NUMBER WASN'T INCLUDED, HOWEVER IT OBVIOUSLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN! I WAS TOLD BY A SERVICE ADVISOR AT HONDA OF ESCONDIDO THAT IF THE MWS GETS WET, THE MOISTURE CAN CAUSE THE PART TO SHORT OUT, OVERHEAT, AND THE GREASE GETS REALLY HOT AND SMOKES, SMELLING TERRIBLY. OUR SWITCH DID GET WET FROM RAIN BOTH TIMES BEFORE THE SWITCH MALFUNCTIONED BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN A CAR DOOR, AND WHEN IT RAINS, IT'S GOING TO GET WET!    BOTH THE ORIGINAL MWS THAT CAME WITH THE CAR WAS FAULTY AND THE MWS THAT I PAID TO REPLACE IT IN 2010 WAS FAULTY AS WELL.

UPON PUSHING THE FRONT DRIVERS SWITCH TO LOWER FRONT LH WINDOW A VERY STRONG SMELL (LIKE SOMETHING BURNING) WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTICED. WINDOW DID LOWER, OCCUPANT WAS ABLE TO ACCESS KEYPAD, PASSED THRU GATE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RAISE DRIVERS WINDOW. PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE, RAISED ENGINE HOOD TO INSPECT IF A FLUID LEAK WAS VISIBLE AND NONE NOTICED. PROCEEDED TO DRIVE HOME AND INSTRUCTED MY HUSBAND THAT I HAD A BAD SMELL/ODOR EMITTING IN THE CABIN. WE NEXT FOUND THAT THE FRONT RH PASSENGER WINDOW WAS NOT OPERATIVE. AFTER EXTENSIVE INTERNET SEARCHES, WE PULLED THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE SWITCH, POPPED THE DOOR BEZEL FIRST, THEN TOOK THE 3 SCREWS THAT HOLDS SWITCH TO BEZEL. MY WIFE WALKED UP WHILE I WAS DISASSEMBLING AND SHE SAID \"THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE SMELL\" !!!!!!!!!! I THEN PROCEEDED TO TAKE OFF THE WINDOW LOCK BUTTON AND THEN THE 3 SCREWS HOLDING BACK PLATE ONTO SWITCH, AND FURTHER DISASSEMBLED. ONCE I HAD THE CONTROL BOARD IN HAND I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE \"MELTING\" OF THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW SWITCH. IT APPEARS THE FRONT LH AND FRONT RH ELECTRONIC MECHANISMS ARCED AND MELTED. I HAVE PHOTOS IF INTERESTED. I ORDERED A NEW SWITCH FROM HONDA DEALER AT A COST OF $200. I ALSO CONTACTED HONDA CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND THEY RECORDED MY COMPLAINT BUT WOULD NOT HELP US IN TERMS OF COMPENSATING US (FULL OR PARTIAL) FOR NEW SWITCH. THIS VEHICLE WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL 2002-2006 FOR MELTING DOOR SWITCHES, MAYBE IT SHOULD OF BEEN. I WOULD ASK NHTSA TO RE-EVALUATE THE INITIAL RECALL AND WIDEN THE SCOPE OF VEHICLES AFFECTED. CLEARLY OUR SITUATION SHOWS THAT THERE ARE VEHICLES OUTSIDE OF THE RECALL THAT ARE SUSPECT. THE RISK OF FIRE OF A COMPONENT THAT HAS BEEN CLEARLY DESCRIBED AS \"HIGH RISK\" IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, TO ME, MY FAMILY OR OTHERS THAT OWN SIMILAR VEHICLES.  *TR",

RECENT 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT TO CORRECT FRONT TIRE WEAR AND RETURN TO MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATIONS HAS RESULTED IN VIOLENT PULL/TORQUE STEER TO RIGHT UPON ACCELERATION. DRIVING AT CRUISING SPEED REQUIRES STEERING CAR TO LEFT TO CONTROL CONSTANT PULL TO RIGHT.  THIS IS NOT A ROAD CROWN ISSUE. I SEE FROM MY OWN INTERNET SEARCHES THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE FOR NUMEROUS YEARS OF THIS VEHICLE, BUT I HAVE NOT YET FOUND ANY COMPLAINTS ON FILE HERE. MANY CONSUMER STORIES FOUND ELSEWHERE DOCUMENT THAT A HONDA DEALER WON'T EVEN CONSIDER ASSISTING THIS PROBLEM IF THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY (LIKE MINE...).  EVEN SO, MANY OTHER STORIES HAVE THE DEALER SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE IF THE ALIGNMENT MEETS THE VEHICLE'S PUBLISHED ALIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS. I AM TRYING TO GET A COPY OF A HONDA TSB THAT MIGHT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, BUT ACCESS TO HONDA MANUFACTURER WEBSITES IS BLOCKED ON ACCESSING TSB'S AND EVEN THIS USGOV SERVICE APPEARS TO REQUIRE PAYING FOR SUCH CRITICAL INFORMATION.  I WILL KEEP LOOKING AND HOPE THAT THERE IS A DEFINITIVE CORRECTION TO THIS DANGEROUS VEHICLE BEHAVIOR AND I HOPE NHTSA WILL TAKE HONDA TO TASK ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY CRV OWNERS.  I SUGGEST NHTSA DO ITS OWN GOOGLE SEARCH FOR THIS PROBLEM AS A STARTING POINT. THANX!!  *TR",

I WAS AT THE DEALERS AND I WAS ABLE TO SEE IT UNWRAPPED WITH ONLY 6 MILES ON IT AS I SINGED THE FORM TO GET IT THAT DAY. I HAD IT INSURANCE THE DAY I PICKED IT UP, WITH THAT BEING SAID I LOVE THIS CAR!   BUT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE NOTICE A GROWING NUMBER OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE SEAT BELTS IN THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE AT TIMES FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SECURELY FASTEN THE SEAT BELTS AT ALL. MY ATTEMPT TO GET THE SEAT BELT SECURED CAN BE LABORING; MY MOTHER WITH HER FAILING HEALTH CANNOT DO IT VERY WELL AT ALL. IF I WAS ONLY ONE OF THE THREE OF US I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT IS JUST MY VEHICLE BUT IT IS NOT. IT CAN TAKE UP TO 5 MINUTES TO DO THIS SIMPLE TASK. THIS MAKES ME QUESTION IF THE CONNECTION WILL GIVE WAY DURING AN ACCIDENT. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS IN THIS CAR TWICE A DAY. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE CAR SEAT BELT BUT ALL THE ONES IN THE BACK AND FRONT. SINCE IT IS THE LAW TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONS IN A VEHICLE ARE SECURELY FASTENS IN THE RETRAINING DEVICES.

I FEAR THAT OWNER OF THIS USED VEHICLES WILL FIND IT REPAIR TO BE HIGH COST ITEMS. PLEASE CONSIDER AN INVESTIGATION OF THESE ISSUES. I HOPE THAT IT WILL RESULTS IN ANOTHER RECALL.

HONDA RECOMMENDS MANUALLY TIGHTENING THE CAP  PAST \"SEVERAL CLICKS\" TO ENSURE A TIGHT SEAL AFTER FUELING. THE CAP LOOSENS ANYWAY ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG GASOLINE FUMES FROM THE LOOSENED CAP. HONDA KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM. THEY REPLACED THE FUEL CAP TWICE AND ONCE GAVE ME A $ 300 ESTIMATE TO REPLACE THE PLASTIC GAS TANK FILLER PIPE WHICH IS APPARENTLY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. TODAY WAS A WARM DAY AND THE LIGHT WAS ON ALL DAY AS I DROVE. THE ISSUE IS THIS: IF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OFTEN COMES ON SPURIOUSLY, A DRIVER DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT MAY BE A LEGITIMATE WARNING FOR A SERIOUS ENGINE PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE LOOSE CAP CAUSES GASOLINE FUMES TO ENTER THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FILLER CAP ISSUE? *TR",

I CALLED BANKSTON HONDA (THE CLOSEST DEALER TO ME IN COPPELL, TX), WHO DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $3,100 TO REPAIR, BUT THAT I SHOULD CALL AMERICAN HONDA AND OPEN A CASE WITH THEM, SINCE THEY MAY AGREE TO COVER SOME OF THE COST. APPARENTLY THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE, ONE THAT HONDA APPEARS TO BE IGNORING FOR THE TIME BEING (AT LEAST UNTIL THEY'RE HIT WITH A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT).

AMERICAN HONDA HAVE GIVEN ME A CASE NUMBER (N012009-05-2601731) AND ASKED THAT I WRITE THEM TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED SO THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THEY'LL COVER ANY OF THE COST. I HOPE THEY AT LEAST PAY FOR THE NECESSARY PARTS. IF THEY COME THROUGH, THEY'LL CEMENT THEIR REPUTATION AND I'LL CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND HONDA TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IF THEY CAN'T OFFER ANY HELP, I'LL NEED TO JOIN THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO TRY TO RECOUP SOME OF THE COST. THIS IS CLEARLY A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM, ONE THAT HONDA WILL EVENTUALLY NEED TO OWN UP TO.

I FOUND A DISCUSSION TOPIC AT EDMUNDS.COM DEVOTED SOLELY TO THIS PROBLEM (HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F0D3FBB.F0D3FB5/0). AS HONDA HAS OFFERED A COURTESY REPAIR TO SOME CUSTOMERS, THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPRESSOR.  *NM",

HE WAS TOLD THAT THE BRAKES NEED TO BE GREASED TO HELP PREVENT THIS- SOMETHING I WAS NOT TOLD WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.

ON 6/25/2004, I WAS REAR ENDED WHILE WAITING ON A METERED FREEWAY ENTRANCE RAMP IN MILWAUKEE, WI.  THE OTHER DRIVER DID NOT KNOW THAT THE RAMP WAS METERED AND REAR ENDED MY VEHICLE BETWEEN 40 - 50 MPH; MY CAR WAS THEN PUSHED INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  ALTHOUGH IT WAS A HIGH SPEED COLLISION ON THE FRONT AND REAR, THE AIRBAG ON MY 2002 HONDA CRV DID NOT INFLATE.  I HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND HAD FACIAL BRUISING AND A LARGE GASH ON MY FOREHEAD REQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 20 STITCHES.  MY CAR IS TOTALED; THE HOOD IS CRUSHED AND THE REAR END WAS PUSHED IN APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET.    I BOUGHT MY CRV NEW IN 2002, PARTIALLY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS A SAFE VEHICLE THAT WOULD PROTECT ME IN THE EVENT OF A CAR ACCIDENT.  ON FRIDAY, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE MY CAR IS SERVICED (RUSS DARROW HONDA IN MILWAUKEE, WI) TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I HAD NOT MISSED ANY RECALLS, AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT MY CAR WAS CURRENT WITH ALL RECALLS (THERE HAVE BEEN NO AIRBAG SPECIFIC RECALLS FOR MY YEAR).    IF MY AIRBAG HAD INFLATED, I MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE SCENE WITHOUT ANY LASTING REMINDERS.  MANY CONSUMERS CONSIDER A VEHICLE SAFETY RATING AND AIRBAG QUALITY WHEN CHOOSING A NEW VEHICLE.  SINCE YOU CANNOT TEST AIRBAGS EXCEPT IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT OR ACCIDENT SITUATION, CONSUMERS MUST RELY ON THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE MANUFACTURER AND HOPE THAT THEY WORK WHEN REQUIRED.  I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY MY AIRBAG DID NOT INFLATE AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OTHER CONSUMERS TO ALSO BE AWARE OF THIS SITUATION... I SEE MANY OTHER HONDA CRVS ON THE ROAD.

NO AIR BAG WAS EVER DEPLOYED WHEN HE HIT THE CURB AND SIGN WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS HE HIT A SIGN AND TREE STRIPPING THE FRONT BUMPER OFF AND  CRUSHED THE RADIATOR INTO THE ENGINE. NO AIR BAGS WEAR EVER DEPLOYED. EVEN THE POLICE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND QUESTIONED IT . IT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF HURST TEXAS. IN THESE FORUMS MANY DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF ENGINE FAILERE AND BRAKES IN SOME CASES. HONDA JUST PUT OUT A RECALL ON 1998-2000 FOR THE ENGINE IGNITION SWITCH SHORTING OUT CAUSING ENGINE FAILERE. I SUGGEST THEY INCREASE THAT RECALL TO 2002 POSSIBLY. ALSO I READ WHERE THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR IS GETTING WET AND SHORTING OUT CAUSING THE SAME THING IN SOME CARS. IN ONE CASE I READ THAT THE VACUMM HOSE TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER MAY BE BAD. PUMPING THE BRAKES CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. SO ANY CASE I THINK HONDA HAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH ENGINES STALLING WHILE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING. MY SON WAS LUCKY HE WAS ONLY DRIVING 15 MPH WHEN IT HAPPENED . IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE. THE VEHICALE IS IN THE BODY SHOP GETTING FIXED AND AFTER THAT WILL BE DRIVEN TO HONDA FOR AN ENGINE CHECK.

SAID THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS MATTER, BUT AT THIS TIME, REPLACING THE BRAKE PADS ARE THE ONLY THING THEY CAN THINK OF TO DO, HOPING THAT THE REPLACEMENT PADS ARE A FRACTION LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL PADS.
