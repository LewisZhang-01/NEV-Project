ALSO, I WAS TOLD, THE REASON FOR MY ISSUES WITH THE LETTER MAY BE BECAUSE THE NJ MVC HAS BEEN SLOW IN DISSEMINATING DRIVER INFORMATION TO CAR COMPANIES. IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE TO HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE FOR A BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE OF COMMUNICATION.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE CALL I LIFTED THE HOOD AND OBSERVED THE LOWER JOINTS OF THE STEERING SHAFT WERE RUSTY AND CORRODED. I SPRAYED THE JOINT WITH WD-40 AND TURNED THE STEERING BACK AND FORTH.  IN PREPARATION FOR A TRIP TWO DAYS LATER I WAS CHECKING THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THE \"EXHAUST HEAT SHIELD\" LYING ON THE FRAME BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND FRAME. IT WAS THEN I FIGURED THE PART HAD COME OFF AND JAMMED BETWEEN THE STEERING SHAFT AND THE FRAME CAUSING A MOMENTARY LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL. I HAVE NOT REPLACED THE HEAT SHIELD. AFTER A FACTORY RECALL REPLACEMENT OF THE LOWER SHAFT RESULTED IN THE CAR STEERING LIKE NEW WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT FOR A MONTH OR SO. I THEN NOTICED THE STEERING SEEMED TO BIND AGAIN AT TIMES. I LOOKED AND THE UPPER STEERING SHAFT IS CORRODED SO I SPRAYED THE U JOINT CONTAINED IN THE UPPER SHAFT WITH LUBRICANT. I CONTACTED THE DEALER WHO SAID THE UPPER SHAFT WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL SO I CALLED FORD AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING. THE UPPER SHAFT JOINT IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME FAILURE AS THE LOWER SHAFT. CORROSION IN THE U JOINT IS CAUSING THE NEEDLE BEARINGS TO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY RESULTING IN MORE DIFFICULT TURNING OF THE STEERING. I LUBRICATE THE JOINT AT TIMES.   I BELIEVE THE \"UPPER STEERING SHAFT\" SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A RECALL DUE TO CORROSION EFFECTING THE PARTS DUE TO DESIGN NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT CONTAMINATES FROM ENTERING THE STEERING U JOINTS.  THE \"EXHAUST HEAT SHIELD\" WAS DETERIORATED DUE TO CORROSION OF THE MOUNTING HOLES USED TO SECURE THE SHIELD TO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD MOUNTING BOLTS.   *TR",

MY CAR OR EVEN THE OTHER CAR DIDN'T HAVE ANY BODY DAMAGE AND AFTER 1 HOUR I STARTED DRIVING AND ON MY WAY HOME THE SAME THING HAPPENED. I GOT OUT OF THE ROAD BUT NO ACCIDENT.

I HAD TO TAKE A CUSTOMER TO THE AIRPORT AND BEFORE I GOT THERE, SMOKE  WAS COMING OUT AND I STOPPED THE CAR IN THE AIRPORT GARAGE. THIS TIME IT BECAME COMPLETELY OUT OF SERVICE AND I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE GARAGE. THE RESULT AS THE MECHANIC TESTED SAID THE TRANSMISSION IS TOTALLY OUT OF USE AND NEED ANOTHER ONE. AGAIN TWO MONTHS BACK WHILE DRIVING I LOST CONTROL OF THE BRAKE AND STOP OUT OF THE ROAD. RECENTLY ON SUNDAY DEC. 19, 2010 MAJOR ACCIDENT HAPPENED. WHILE DRIVING I COULDN'T CONTROL THE BRAKE AND THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN. SO, I HIT THE FENCE ON THE ROAD AND THE VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE GARAGE AND WHEN THE MECHANIC TESTED HE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING, EVEN HE DID A ROAD TEST. I WAS ADVISED THIS VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS IF I START DRIVING .

I HAD DROPPED OFF MY CAR ON SATURDAY, JULY 15, 2006 TO HAVE THE AC CONTROL SWITCH REPLACED, LEFT FRONT TIRE REPAIRED AND RIGHT FRONT DOOR RATTLE DIAGNOSED.   AFTER LEAVING THE FORD DEALERSHIP, I PROCEEDED DOWN THE ROAD TO MEET A FRIEND FOR LUNCH.  THE RESTAURANT WAS JUST A FEW MILES FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP. I PULLED INTO THE ENTRANCE TO THE CASINO/RESTAURANT AND STOPPED AT A 4 WAY STOP.  AFTER REMOVING MY RIGHT FOOD FROM THE BRAKE AND BEGINNING TO PROCEED, THE ENGINE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN AT A VERY HIGH RATE.  I ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE VEHICLE BY USING THE BRAKES BUT THIS HAD NO EFFECT IN STOPPING THE CAR.  OUT OF COMPLETE DESPERATION, I THREW THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF.  AFTER CALMING DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES, I RESTARTED THE ENGINE WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES.  WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE, THE CAR ONCE AGAIN BEGAN FULL ACCELERATION.  I AGAIN THREW THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF.  I NOTICED DURING THIS SECOND INCIDENT THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS LIGHTED SYMBOLS THAT CAME ON THE DASH.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE CAR OUT OF TRAFFIC AND INTO A AREA FREE OF PEDESTRIANS, I STARTED THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED A THIRD TIME. I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL AND MANAGED TO GET THE CAR PARKED.  I WENT INTO THE CASINO AND WAS ASSISTED BY AN EMPLOYEE IN CALLING THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED THE INCIDENTS.  THEY ADVISED ME TO CALL FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, WHICH I DID.  FOUR HOURS LATER A TOW TRUCK ARRIVED AND TOWED  MY CAR TO DON BOHN FORD.  DURING MY 4 HOUR WAIT IN THE PARKING LOT I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND THE SERVICE MANAGER.
