After researching the cause online and the solution which was to remove the defective HFL unit which was done.  Yesterday I came across that TSB and contacted Acura with my correspondence from 2012, 2014 and the TSB.  So far I'm getting the run around.  I just want a replacement module for the one that I have kept as a reminder of how I was screwed by Acura.   The TSB states all 2005 TL's are affected yet today they had the gaul to say it was no longer in warranty.   This is a critical safety item in that it provides hands free utilization of the cellular phone.  This came defective from the factory in that I was never able to either connect to the garage door opener or to the phone and was extremely angered by the dealer insisting that I just didnt know what I was doing.  I perform surgery in peoples mouths for a living and build and program computers and networks on the side.  I know that this module with part number 1135133c1m3m04 or 3qc32dc2  on 2 stickers on back of the circuit board are defective.  The TSB only lists what is on the plastic cover to the module and not the module itself.  Please verify that these modules are in fact garbage.",

ON JULY 23, 2018, APPROXIMATELY 4:15PM, I WAS EXITING VIA REVERSE FROM A PARKING SPACE AT A LOCAL SHOPPING CENTER.  I SHIFTED THE CAR INTO DRIVE, PROCEEDED FORWARD AT A SPEED OF 3MPH, FOR LESS THAN TEN FEET TO MAKE A SLIGHT LEFT TURN, WHEN THERE WAS THE SOUND OF BREAKING METAL, AND THE CAR CAME TO A HALT. THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE, FOOT ON GAS, BUT WOULD NOT MOVE.  I STRUGGLED TO SHIFT THE GEAR INTO PARK, THEN RESTARTED.  THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO DRIVE, WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I GOT IT INTO REVERSE, THEN ROLLED BACKWARDS INTO A HANDICAPPED PARKING SPACE.  THE GEAR WAS NOW STUCK IN REVERSE, AND KEY WAS LOCKED IN IGNITION.  I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, TURNED ON HAZARD LIGHTS, AND EXITED THE VEHICLE. I PLACED PHONE CALLS TO A TOWING COMPANY, AND MY MECHANIC.      UPON INSPECTION, IT WAS DETERMINED \"THE DRIVER'S FRONT AXLE ASSEMBLY SNAPPED IN TWO. THE AXLE SHAFT HAD RUSTED UNDERNEATH THE VIBRATION DAMPER.  THE PASSENGER FRONT AXLE ASSEMBLY LOOKED RUSTED\".  AT MY DIRECTION, THE MECHANIC REPLACED BOTH FRONT AXLE ASSEMBLIES.    BOTH MYSELF AND THE MECHANIC SEARCHED FOR A RECALL, OR EVEN AN UPDATE TO THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE/SERVICE, BUT FOUND NOTHING.  CAR AXLES SHOULD NOT RANDOMLY SNAP IN HALF.

HEAT CAUSES THE CRACKS TO CLOSE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM AND OPEN UP WHEN THE WEATHER OR INTERIOR IS COOLER.

DURING OUR CONVERSATION, I TOLD THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND DISCOVERED THAT SEVERAL THOUSAND COMPLAINTS HAVE   BEEN FORWARDED TO THE OFFICE OF DEFECT INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH A FACEBOOK PAGE WITH OTHER DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS.  THE REPRESENTATIVES SEEMED UNAWARE OF THE 'SPLIT DASH' PRODUCT DEFECT, WHICH I FOUND UNBELIEVABLE. ACURA DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND I'M SURE THAT THE CORPORATE OFFICE WAS NOTIFIED BY THEM WHEN ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS CAME IN. THE FACT THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES WOULD DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISSUE WAS A BLATANT LIE. I WAS TOLD TO BRING MY VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST ACURA DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY WOULD TAKE PICTURES OF THE DASHBOARD (SEE ENCLOSED PICTURES).             WHILE DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED THAT MY AIRBAG LIGHT WAS NOW LIT. THE DEALERSHIP TOOK PICTURES OF THE 3 LARGE CRACKS AND LIT AIRBAG LIGHT AND TOLD ME HE WOULD GET BACK IN TOUCH WITH ME ONCE ACURA RESPONDED TO HIM. AFTER A FEW DAYS, THE DEALERSHIP CALLED TO SAY ACURA WAS GOING TO MAKE A 'GOOD WILL' GESTURE AND ONLY CHARGE ME 50% OF THE COST TO REPLACE IT, SINCE THE WARRANTY FOR THE DASHBOARD HAD EXPIRED.  MY COST WOULD BE BETWEEN $900 TO $1000.               I WAS APPALLED THAT ACURA WOULD EVEN CONSIDER HAVING A CUSTOMER PAY FOR A DEFECTIVE PART THAT WAS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY.

AFTER THE SERVICE, I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED MY CAR FELT UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND HAD A VERY ROUGH RIDE. AFTER NUMEROUS DEALER VISITS, THEY REPLACED THE REAR STRUT ASSEMBLY. NONE OF THIS IMPROVED THE HANDLING OR RIDE. AT THIS TIME, THE DEALER STATED I HAD THE WRONG TIRES AND NEEDED TO REPLACE THEM WITH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MICHELIN PILOT MXM4 TIRES. I HAD NEARLY NEW MICHELIN PILOT SPORT A/S PLUS TIRES AND NOT EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM PRIOR TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BUSHINGS. I CHECKED AT COSTCO, WHERE I PURCHASED THE TIRES, AND THEY INDICATED THAT MICHELIN PILOT SPORT PLUS TIRES WERE AN ACCEPTABLE UPGRADE FOR MY VEHICLE. THE OWNERS MANUAL DOES NOT MENTION THAT THE ACURA SUSPENSION REQUIRES TIRES ONLY PURCHASED AT THE DEALER.  ON NOV. 8, 2010, DURING A ROUTINE SERVICE VISIT, THE DEALER NOTED FINGERNAIL SIZE CHUNKS OF RUBBER PEALING OFF MY 2 FRONT TIRES. THEY RECOMMENDED I IMMEDIATELY CHANGE THEM SINCE THEY WERE UNSAFE. COSTCO AGREED TO PRORATE AND REPLACE THEM WITH THE DEALER RECOMMENDED TIRE. I NOTIFIED THE DEALER OF THE PURCHASE AND THEN WAS TOLD THAT MICHELIN MADE SPECIAL TIRES ONLY AVAILABLE AT THE ACURA DEALER. UNTIL TODAY, THE DEALER NEVER STATED THAT MICHELIN PILOT MXM4 TIRES MANUFACTURED ESPECIALLY FOR ACURA WERE THE ONLY TIRES THAT WOULD WORK WITH THE ACURA SUSPENSION. I HAVE SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS.   NOWHERE DOES IT SAY YOU MUST BUY REPLACEMENT TIRES FROM THE DEALER TO HAVE A SAFE CAR.   ACURA SHOULD NOT SELL A CAR THAT CAN BE SAFELY DRIVEN WITH TIRES ONLY PURCHASED FROM THEM.   I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT HAD I NOT TAKEN THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE, I MAY HAVE HAD A MAJOR TIRE FAILURE CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  I AM REQUESTING THAT THE NTSB INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AND DETERMINE IF OTHER ACURA DRIVERS ARE AT RISK DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF TIRES FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THE ACURA DEALER.   UPDATED 01/20/11 *BF",

I WAS DRIVING ON ROUTE 83 IN BALTIMORE AT AROUND 6AM AND WITHOUT ANY IMPACT OR WARNING, MY FRONT  AND REAR DRIVER'S SIDE AS WELL AS THE DRIVER'S SEAT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED IN MY 2005 ACURA TL.  I THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS SHOOTING OR MY TIRE BLEW OUT. I IMMEDIATELY GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CHECKED THE CAR AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG, EXCEPT THE AIR BAG DAMAGE. IT DAMAGED MY DRIVER?S SEAT AND INTERIOR ROOF IN THE FRONT AND BACK. THE STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY, NOR DID THE AIR BAGS INFLATE. THE CAR WAS DRIVABLE, BUT THE SEAT BELT WAS BROKEN.     AFTER SETTLING AT WORK, I PLACE A CALL TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TO NORRIS ACURA (ELLICOTT CITY, MD) WHERE I HAVE MY AUTO SERVICE DONE. THE INSURANCE COMPANY ASKED ME TO CONTACT ACURA BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. ACURA ASKED ME TO BRING MY CAR IN THE NEXT DAY. THEY EVALUATED THE CAR AND ASKED ME TO  CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE CAR. THEY INSIST THAT I MUST HAVE HIT A POT HOLE, ICE OR SOMETHING. I HIT NOTHING. IF THAT WAS THE CASE AND I HIT SOMETHING, THE AIR BAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED AND INFLATED. THEY NEVER INFLATED, THEY JUST DEPLOYED. THE AIR BAG IN THE STEERING ALSO NEVER DEPLOYED. SO IF  THEY SAY THAT I MUST HAVE HIT SOMETHING, THEN THE AIRBAGS ARE STILL DEFECTIVE AND WOULD NOT HAVE PROTECTED ME IN AN IMPACT.     MY CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP NOW WITH 3 DEPLOYED AIRBAGS (DRIVER'S SIDE) WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE CAR. I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.

ON THIS OCCASION, WHILE TRAVELING AT 65 MILES PER HOUR ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, MY CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE.  I MANAGED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND STOP.  THE TIRE SIDEWALL HAD DISINTEGRATED AND WAS COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE RIM.  THE FOLLOWING DAY I TOOK THE TIRE INTO A FIRESTONE SHOP WHERE THE SERVICE MANAGER, TOM CURRY, ADVISED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO A ROAD HAZARD AND WAS NOT A DEFECT.  HE INSPECTED THE TIRE FOR A PUNCTURE, AND AFTER NOT FINDING ONE, ASSURED ME THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE DISINTEGRATED SIDEWALL.  I THEN ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER SEEN A TIRE THAT WAS DAMAGED IN THE ABSENCE OF A ROAD HAZARD, AND HE TOLD ME HE HAD NOT.

THE TIRE AND THE REST OF THE RIM CAME LOSSE FROM THE CAR AND PASSED AHEAD OF THE CAR. WHEN THE FRONT TIRE BROKE FREE FROM THE CAR SEVERAL THINGS HAPPENED. THE CAR SETTLED DOWN ON THE SPOKES OF THE MAG RIM, THIS IMPACT SET OFF THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAGS AND CRACKED THE BRAKE CALIPER ON THE FRONT LEFT. BRAKING WAS NOT EFFECTIVE AT THIS POINT. THE CAR EVENTUALLY CAME TO A STOP IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE OF ROAD. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE ACURA DEALERSHIP ( ON A FLATBED TRUCK).  THE WOMAN AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US THAT THEY WANTED THE CAR TAKEN TO THEIR COLLSION CENTER SO THAT  DIGITAL PICTURES COULD BE TAKEN AND FORWARDED TO ACURA.
