My air conditioner works fine When I park my car in the garage and close the door, it is so hot until I will leave the gavrage door open. The recall was for the ABS system to hae a fuse system replaced that could affect more than breaks (this is what I was told). Specifically, the car was at risk for catching on fire because of this fuse. My ABS caution light is on along with other warnings and because of the recall, I am having difficulty getting my car serviced. I called Genesis Corporate and he told me not to park the car in the garage and he asked if I needed numbers to other dealerships for repair. My concern is why sale something that you are not equipped to repair? I want it documented that this car was supposedly repaired, but clearly there is something else going on I am not sure what your agency's role is with recall, but this is a government agency so I am assuming that you guys have some checks and balances in place for safety. There is something else going on with these vehicles When my car catches on fire with me in it or while parked in the garage at the hospital where I work, I wan you to know.  Thank You",
