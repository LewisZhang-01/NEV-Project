THE LINKED BRAKING SYSTEM APPLIES FAR TOO MUCH PRESSURE TO THE FRONT BRAKES, AND THE ABS SYSTEM APPLIES ITSELF IN A MANNER THAT INTERFERES WITH SMOOTH OPERATION IN THE CORNER. WERE IT NOT FOR EXTENSIVE FORMAL TRAINING AND DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AS A RIDER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONTROL THE MOTORCYCLE, LIKELY RESULTING IN A COLLISION.
