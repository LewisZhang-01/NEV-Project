I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY TESTED (IN AN EMPTY PARKING LOT) IF THE KEY FOB OR THE DOOR-RELEASE WILL OPERATE WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION (I.E. I TESTED TO SEE IF PERHAPS I HAS INADVERTENTLY TRIGGERED THE DOOR OPENING BUTTON)-- AND NEITHER WILL OPEN THE DOOR WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING.     I HAVE CONTACTED AUDI AND THEIR FIRST RESPONSE WAS THAT I HAD PROBABLY ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE BUTTON, AND THEN THEIR NEXT REPLY WAS THAT WHAT DID I WANT THEM TO DO SINCE THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE THEY COULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.     I INDICATED THAT THIS CAR WAS ESSENTIALLY UN-USABLE TO ME AT THIS TIME AS I OFTEN HAVE DOGS IN THE BACK OF THE CAR- AND CAN NO LONGER SAFELY USE THIS VEHICLE FOR FEAR THAT AT ANY MOMENT THE BACK DOOR WILL OPEN WHILE I'M DRIVING.  *TR",
