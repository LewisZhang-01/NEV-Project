I was unaware of a recall (02V120000) until recently. I have owned this car sense 2002 and the current millage is 109,000 miles.  I contacted Findlay Acura in Henderson NV. and they stated there was no recall on the ignition switch which I have recently found that there was as noted above.  Can you contact the Dealer on my behalf as I am under the impression that the dealer is suppose to replace the defective part at no cost as it does cause an unsafe condition when it occurs. Engine just dies without warning. There has not been an independent assessment of the condition as it occurs on a random basis and of course, never occurs when you want it to.",

EACH TIME IT HAPPENED THE ENGINE SHUT OFF COMPLETELY BUT, THE RADIO AND WARNING LIGHT IN THE DASH FLASHED ON AND OFF.  I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO A STOP WITHOUT POWER STEERING.  AFTER 3-4 ATTEMPS TO RESTART THE CAR, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT. IT HAPPENS SO RANDOM AND WITHOUT WARNING THAT I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS CAR.  THE CAR HAS HAD A RECALL OF THE IGNITION SWITCH PERFORMED IN 2003 BY THE ACURA DEALER.  ON 3/24/14 I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM.  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 4 DAYS.  THEY REPLACED THE MAIN FUEL RELAY, PERFORMED AN ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC CHECK, PERFORMED A RECALL ON THE IGNITION INTERLOCK AND ROAD TESTED THE CAR. I PICKED UP THE CAR ON 3/27/14 AND IT STALLED LATER THAT DAY AS I WAS DRIVING AWAY FROM MY HOME.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER ON 3/28/14 AND THEY STILL HAVE THE CAR.  I WANT THE NTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS ENGINE STALL ISSUE WITH THE 1999 ACURA TL.  I CALLED ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS TO REPORT THE PROBLEM ON 3/26/14.  I ASKED THEM TO SERIOUSLY LOOK INTO THIS COMPLAINT. I BELIEVE NTSA SHOULD GET INVOLVED TO GET ACURA TO CHECK/REBUILD THE FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH AND CONDUCT A FRESH RECALL.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS & SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE RECENT GM IGNITION SWITCH RECALL.  ANY VEHICLE THAT SUDDENLY AND SILENTLY SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING INSTANTLY AND WITHOUT WARNING NEEDS NTSA'S IMMEDIATE ATTENTION BEFORE INJURYS AND DEATHS OCCUR.  I HAVE LOST ALL FAITH IN ACURA TO SUCCESSFULLY REPAIR THIS IGNITION SWITCH/STALLING ISSUE AND CALL UPON NTSA TO GET INVOLVED TO INVESTIGATE THIS COMPLAINT TO DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO..SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT INJUTY.   *TR",

THERE IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE YOUR EYES COMPLETELY FROM THE ROAD AND STICK YOUR FACE CLOSE TO THE ODOMETER IN ORDER TO READ IT.  ON A RECENT 2,000 MILE TRIP, I WANTED TO CHECK MY TRIP ODOMETER FREQUENTLY.  IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO TAKE TRY AND READ THE DISPLAY.  SOONER OR LATER, SOMEONE WILL BE DISTRACTED ENOUGH TO HAVE OR CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  I CONTACTED THE ACURA DIVISION OF AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO. BUT THEY STATE THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM.  THE IDIOT WHO DESIGNED THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DISPLAY OBVIOUSLY NEVER DROVE THE CAR IN THE DAYTIME.  WHILE THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE FATALITIES, IT IS STILL A SAFETY HAZARD.  AND, THIS LEVEL OF POOR DESIGN SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.",
