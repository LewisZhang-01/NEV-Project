I slowly drove on side road watching back driver tire when I noticed it was facing outward as I steered straight. I learned from tow driver the sway bar/support snapped off from frame. I had car towed to where I was staying & researched on internet and was shocked to see many other Honda elements with same exact issue - and recall but now I see no recall (only in Canada where his Honda was repaired at no cost to him just in April of 2021 for 2003 Honda Element.

AS HE BEGAN UP A HILL AND AROUND A CURVE THAT TURNS SHARPLY TO THE LEFT, HE HEARD A LOUD CRACK.  THE CAR VEERED OFF OF THE ROAD SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT, LESS THAN AN INCH DROPOFF.  WHEN HE TRIED TO STEER THE CAR TO THE LEFT, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT MOVE THE CAR.  AS THE CURVE IN THE ROAD BEGAN TO END, THE CAR MOVED QUICKLY TO THE LEFT BUT STILL WOULD NOT RESPOND TO THE STEERING WHEEL.  IT RAN OFF THE ROAD TO THE LEFT AND WENT INTO A DITCH ABOUT 18 INCHES DEEP.  THEN, APPARENTLY THE RIGHT WHEEL BENT UP UNDER THE CAR.  THE WHEEL BROKE IN TWO, AS DID THE ROTOR.  THE WHEEL THEN DUG INTO THE PAVEMENT AND CUT A GROOVE INTO THE PAVEMENT ABOUT 8 FEET LONG.  APPARENTLY THIS RAPID SLOWING DOWN OF THE RIGHT SIDE, COUPLED WITH THE CONTINUED MOVEMENT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR, PROJECTED THE CAR OUT OF THE DITCH AND CAUSED IT TO ROLL OVER TWICE AND LAND ON ITS ROOF.  THE AIRBAGS NEVER DEPLOYED.  MY SON WAS ABLE TO DISENGAGE THE SEATBELT AND LOWER HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE ROOF AND GET OUT OF THE SHATTERED DRIVER SIDE WINDOW.  HE WAS UNINJURED EXCEPT FOR SOME SMALL SHARDS OF GLASS IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND FOREARM.  WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR, WE SAW THAT THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE WAS SNAPPED IN TWO AT THE TRANSMISSION.  BOTH THE WHEEL AND THE ROTOR WERE BROKEN IN HALF.  THE CAR WAS DECLARED \"TOTALED.\"  MY CONCERN IS THAT WHATEVER SNAPPED OR CRACKED INITIALLY RENDERED THE CAR UNSTEERABLE.  I WOULD LIKE AN INVESTIGATION THAT MIGHT PERHAPS PREVENT SUCH A THING HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE. *TR",

REP SAID IT MIGHT BE THE SENSOR BUT THAT I COULD  HAVE HIT A POTHOLE OR SOMETHING CAUSING THE AIR BAG TO DEPLOY. THE CAR WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF MY HOME. WE HIT NOTHING! THE AIR BAG JUST DEPLOYED! HONDA REP TOLD ME TO FILE WITH MY INSURANCE. STATE FARM DENIES CLAIM AND SAYS IT WILL NOT PAY BECAUSE THIS IS \"CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.\"  THE HONDA REP ALSO SAID HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENING BEFORE.

I CONTACTED THE DEALER, BUT THEY SAID IT'S NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY SINCE THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRIS, REGARDLESS OF HOW SMALL THAT DEBRIS MAY BE. TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT, I DISCOVERED A 3\" CRACK ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. AGAIN, THE CRACKED STARTED WITH A PINPOINT ON THE BLACK AREA OF THE WINDSHIELD. I CALLED THE WINDSHIELD EXPERTS IN MY AREA, WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY'VE BEEN REPLACING AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF WINDSHIELDS ON HONDA ELEMENTS. ARMED WITH THIS INFORMATION, I CONTACTED HONDA CUSTOMER RELATIONS. THE REPRESENTATIVE DENIED ANY ISSUES WITH WINDSHIELDS ON THE ELEMENTS AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WHETHER THEY HAVE RECEIVED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. THE MOST SHE COULD DO WAS SUBMIT A COMPLAINT ON MY BEHALF (COMPLAINT NUMBER N012004-04-2100773).

NO \"STAR\" EFFECT NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ROCKHITS. MY SECOND SUSPICION IS THAT THE CURVE IN THE LOWER WINDHIELD IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE STAIGHTNESS OF THE UPPER WINDHIELD AND CAUSING STRESS ON BOTTOM OF WINDSHIELD.

I HAVE DRIVEN VEHICLES OVER 35 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH A MINOR PEBBLE HIT.

GLASS STRESS IS JUST THAT & STRESS ON GLASS THAT IS NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED, FITTED, OR DESIGNED WILL LEAD TO CRACKS FROM MINOR IMPACTS AT A HIGHER RATE.  I VISITED THE HTTP://WWW.HONDAELEMENT.ORG/SHOWTHREAD.PHP  WEBSITE AND NOTED THAT 25 TO 30 % OF NEW ELEMENT OWNER COMPLAINTS HAD TO DO WITH CRACKED WINDSHIELDS.  IN SOME CASES OWNER HAD ALREADY REPLACED THEIR WINDSHIELDS TWICE   ($500.00 A POP).  HONDA'S CURRENT POLICY IS TO SIDE STEP THE PROBLEM. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THIS IS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE AND HONDA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP UP AND WORK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

THE WINDSHIELD FAILURES ON MY ELEMENT HAPPENED ON JUNE, 3, 2003, AT 140 ODOMETER MILEAGE, AND JULY 9, 2003 AT 748 ODOMETER READING. HONDA WILL NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. TOTAL COST FOR BOTH ADDED UP TO $1047.00.  HONDA IS BEING ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE AND SELL A VEHICLE, FOR WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONTAINS A BASIC SAFETY RELATED DESIGN AND ENGINEERING FLAW, AND FOR WHICH THEY ARE MAKING CUSTOMERS PAY FOR ALL REPAIRS AND RELATED EXPENSES, IE, RENTAL CARS, BECAUSE THE HONDA WINDSHIELDS ARE IN SUCH DEMAND AND ARE BACKORDERED BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF FAILURES. IF ALL THE HONDA ELEMENT OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELD FAILURES HAD FILED COMPLAINT FORMS WITH THE NHTSA, THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS WOULD BE OVERWHELMING,  SURELY IN THE THOUSANDS.  THERE ARE MANY POSTS ON WEB SITES, IE, EDMUNDS.COM , ELEMENTOWNERSCLUB.COM, PLUS OTHERS. THE NHTSA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP HONDA FROM FURTHUR SALES OF THE HONDA ELEMENT TO UNSUSPECTING BUYERS, BECAUSE SUCH A SALE IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAWS GOVERNING SALE OF A PRODUCT WITH A DESIGNED-IN SAFETY DEFECT AND NOT INFORMING THE CUSTOMER OF THE DEFECT. SUCH A SALE ALSO CONSTITUTES FRAUD, FOR MISREPRESENTING A PRODUCT AS SAFE AND WITHOUT DEFECTS, WHEN THE MANUFACTURER AND SELLER ARE COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE DEFECTS. ADDITIONALLY, HONDA MUST BE MADE TO REIMBURSE ELEMENT OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENTS.  HONDA IS PROFITING IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT CUSTOMER EXPENSE AND UNAWARENESS OF THE EXISTENSE OF THE WINDSHIELD DEFECTS.

IT WAS A VERY LOW SPEED (3-5 MPH MAXIMUM) COLLISION HOWEVER THE SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE WAS ASTOUNDING,  MY ELEMENT BASICALLY DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY FRONT BUMPER SUPPORT, RATHER APPEARS TO HAVE TWO BEAMS PROTRUDING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR, THAT LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING HORIZONTAL BETWEEN THEM BUT THEY DO NOT.  ONE OF THE BEAMS IMPALED THE CAR AHEAD OF ME STABBING THRU ITS BUMPER INTO THE VEHICLE SLIGHTLY BENDING THE METAL BELOW THE BUMPER.  MY ELEMENT ENDED UP WITH $1786.00 IN DAMAGE.  THE PLASTIC BUMPER COVER (THAT HAS NO BUMPER SUPPORT BENEATH IT) SHATTERED AND THE SINGLE POINT IMPACT ALLOWED MY CAR TO SOMEHOW DESTROY THE CONDENSER, RADIATER, AND FRAME THAT SUPPORTS THE CONDENSER.  I HAVE INVOLVED HONDA OF  MY CONCERNS AND THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT THE ELEMENT IS DESIGNED TO NOT HAVE A HORIZONTAL BUMPER SUPPORT IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  MY QUESTION REMAINS HOW IS THE VEHICLE ENGINEERED TO BE SAFE IF THERE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANYTHING THERE TO DISTRIBUTE THE FORCE IN THE CASE OF A HIGHER-THAN-3-5MPH COLLISION?  I NOTICED THAT YOU HAVE RELEASED STELLER FRONT COLLISION RATINGS ON THIS VEHICLE, IT WOULD HELP ME TREMENDOSLY IF YOU COULD CONFIRM THAT THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN MAKES SENSE.  I AM CURRENTLY TOO NERVOUS TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND HAVE LEFT IT (REPAIRED BACK TO IT'S ORIGINAL NO BUMPER SUPPORT FORM) AT THE DEALERSHIP.  PLEASE OH PLEASE OH PLEASE RESPOND SO WE CAN PUT THIS BEHIND US AND MOVE ON.  WE DO HAVE PHOTOS ON DISC IF THAT WOULD HELP MY WORDS MAKE SENSE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH,  DIANE MUNIZZA GOODNIGHT.     *JB",
