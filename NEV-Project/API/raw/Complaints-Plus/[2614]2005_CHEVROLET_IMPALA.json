SPENT $2100 AND WAS QUOTE $2600 TO REPLACE THE ABS/TRACTION CONTROL MODULATOR FOR MY ABS/TRACTION CONTROL TO WORK AGAIN. THE CODE THEY PULLED WAS C1218.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IT HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED YET.  A MONTH AFTER SPENDING THIS MONEY, I HAD TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP, AND ALMOST A YEAR LATER I HAD TO REPLACE A PLASTIC ELBOW FROM THE WATER PUMP TO MY RADIATOR WHICH WAS ANOTHER $300.

THEY SUGGESTED I TRY A \"TRANSMISSION SHOP\" FOR THEM TO CHECK BECAUSE MAYBE MY TRANS SOLENOID WAS BAD, WHICH WOULD STILL COST QUITE A BIT FOR REPAIR, BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS A NEW TRANSMISSION.

AFTER GETTING IN MY 2005 IMPALA SEDAN AT APPROXIMATELY 4:55 PM ON 16 FEBRUARY 2012, I STARTED UP AND DROVE OUT ON THE ROAD THEN I SMELLED BURNING PLASTIC AND NOTICED THE HEADLIGHTS (LOW BEAM) WERE OUT.  I TRIED THE HIGH BEAMS AND THEY WORKED AS DID THE LEFT AND RIGHT TURN SIGNALS, THE WINDSHIELD WIPER CONTROLS AND THE CRUISE CONTROL FUNCTIONED.  AS DARKNESS INCREASED I HAD TO HOLD THE SWITCH IN THE HIGH BEAM POSITION SO I COULD SEE TO DRIVE SO I COULD GET HOME.     FROM WHAT I COULD DETERMINE THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE IN THE WIRING TO/FROM THE MULTIFUNCTION LIGHT CONTROL SWITCH OR MAYBE IT IS THE SWITCH ITSELF ON THE STEERING COLUMN.  THE FUSES AND RELAYS AND THE ALL SEEMED TO BE IN WORKING ORDER BUT THE LOW BEAM LIGHTS STILL DID NOT WORK.    THIS FAILURE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND HAPPENS WITHOUT WARNING. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME NOW.  WITH DEALER PARTS COST FOR A REPLACEMENT MULTIFUNCTION LIGHT SWITCH AT $350.00 ALONE, NOT TO MENTION LABOR COSTS AND THE CRITICALITY OF LIGHTS WHILE DRIVING MEANS THIS SHOULD BE A REQUIRED SAFETY RECALL ITEM.      I HAVE SEARCHED MECHANICAL FORUMS ON THIS SUBJECT AND THERE ARE MANY SUCH OCCURRENCES DOCUMENTED, BUT GM DOES NOT SEEM TO THINK THERE IS A COMMON PROBLEM OR A REASON TO INVESTIGATE AND FIX THE MALFUNCTION.  THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AT GM DEALERSHIPS NATIONWIDE.    SMELLING BURNING PLASTIC IS AN INDICATION OF A SERIOUS ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN ONBOARD FIRE IN THE CAR IN ADDITION TO CAUSING INJURY AND OR DEATH FROM A SUDDEN LIGHT OUTAGE AT NIGHT.  AGAIN, I REQUEST A NATIONWIDE SAFETY RECALL AND REPAIR BE INITIATED  AS IT APPEARS TO BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND AN EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",

THE CLUSTERS ARE THE ROOT OF ALL THE PROBLEMS AND CHEVROLET NEEDS TO RECALL TO REPAIR THE ISSUES DESCRIBED. ANOTHER ALARMING PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 CHEVY IMPALA I OWN IS WHAT IS CALLED THE PASSLOCK PROTECTION. IT ALSO DOES NOT WORK AT TIMES AND I   HAD TO FIND OUT WAYS TO BYPASS THE PASSLOCK ON YOUTUBE. THIS COULD TURN INTO A DANGEROUS SITUATION IF YOU NEED TO START YOU CAR IN AN EMERGENCY  AND YOU CANT BECAUSE THE PASSLOCK WILL NOT LET YOU TURN ON THE CAR. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WAIT TEN MINUTES WITH THE KEY IN A CERTAIN POSITION. THAT IS TOTALLY NOT ACCEPTABLE.   *KB",

SO I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HELP AND HAD A TRANSMISSION FLUSH AND FILTER CHANGE WHICH ONLY SOLVED THIS ISSUE FOR NOT EVEN A WEEK. I WENT ONTO GM'S WEBSITE AND WAS READING THE FORUMS SPECIFICALLY FOR CHEVY IMPALA TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND THERE WAS NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE BUT NO OFFER FROM GM TO EVEN LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE. MY CAR STARTED TO NOTICEABLY HAVE THIS ISSUE BEFORE EVEN HAVING 100K MILES ON IT AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE 131K MILES. I HAVE FOLLOWED THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE WITH MY CAR SINCE I TOOK OWNERSHIP IN 2006. I POSTED MY SAID ISSUE ON FACEBOOK AND ONE OF MY HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES COMMENTED THAT HE WORKS AT A CHEVY DEALERSHIP (HAS FOR 13 YEARS) AND ONLY KNOWS OF THE PRESSURE CONTROL SOLINOID ISSUE, SO APPARENTLY GM JUST DOESN'T WANT TO DO THEIR CUSTOMERS RIGHT BY FIXING EVEN THE KNOWN DEFECT OR FOLLOWUP WITH THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS STATED ON THEIR FORUM. I JUST PAID OFF MY CAR AND I FEEL THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY SUCH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO FIX A DEFECT ON THEIR PART.

THE STEERING STILL HAS AN UNSTABLE FEEL WHEN TURNING AND MAKE A METAL TO METAL CLINKING NOISE FROM A DEFECTIVE (& AS TOLD BY MY MECHANIC & NHTSA REPORTS, REPEATEDLY REPORTED) INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT. THERE SHOULD BE A TOTAL RECALL BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECTIVE GM ENGINEERING PROBLEM.   THERE IS ALSO A CLINKING NOISE OCCASIONALLY WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STANDING STOP;  CAN NOT TELL IF THIS DEFECT IS FROM THE STEERING OR SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THE ENGINE MOUNTS.  HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED THIS SOURCE.   FROM A STANDING STOP, THE TRANSMISSION WILL OCCASIONALLY SHIFT ABRUPTLY, EITHER FROM A NEUTRAL DISPOSITION INTO 1ST GEAR OR FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR; THE CAR LURCHES FORWARD & THE OCCUPANTS HEADS ARE WHIPPED BACK.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO OTHER REPORTS OF DEFECTIVE POWER TRAIN FUNCTIONALITY I'VE READ ABOUT WITH THIS MODEL.   BRAKING, WHEN JUST STARTING A TRIP, HAS AN IMPROPER FEEL AND SOMETIMES SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GRINDING, AS IF THE BRAKE PADS OR ROTORS ARE CRACKED/WORN;  THIS IS A SENSATION I'VE HAD WITH VEHICLES HAVING 100,000 MILES, NOT ON A CAR LIKE THIS WITH ONLY 20K MILES.     THE CENTER ARM REST'S PAD SUPPORT IS FLIMSY/CHEAP PLASTIC & HAS BROKEN SIMPLY UPON ENTERING & SHIFTING IN THE SEAT.   I NOW SEE WHY SO MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE DISCONTINUED THE IMPALA'S IN FAVOR OF THE CHARGER'S, CROWN VIC'S, TAURUS'S AND ESCAPES.  THE US GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE SEVERELY FINING GM FOR MARKETING THIS CAR. >>>THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED FOR MANY REASONS<<<",

MY GAS GAUGE GOES WAY PAST THE FULL LINE AND NEVER COMES BACK DOWN, THE SPEEDOMETER WILL SAY I AM DOING OVER 200 KM WHEN I MAY BE DOING 50 KM, THE ONLY WAY I HAVE FOUND TO \"FIX\" THIS IS BY LETTING THE CAR COOL OFF FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN TURN THE KEY OFF AND ON UNTIL IT DROPS THE SPEEDOMETER BACK DOWN TO ZERO, AND MY RPM GAUGE WILL DROP TO UNDER ZERO WHILE DRIVING.   THIS HAPPENS MOSTLY DURING COLD WEATHER, BUT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR.    I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE RCMP AND THEY FEEL THIS IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE COMPANY AND HAVE ONLY BEEN TOLD THAT I MAY GET A DISCOUNT ON HAVING THE PART IN QUESTION REPLACED...I WAS TOLD BY ONE DEALERSHIP IT WAS A CLUSTER PROBLEM IN THE DASH AND THE PART ALONE IS $600 NOT INCLUDING LABOR.    I HAVE TO TRAVEL 6 HRS A MONTH ATLEAST FOR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AND THE SAFETY ISSUE MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS ON THE DRIVES TO AND FROM MY DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS AS I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING ON THE CURVES, DOWN HILLS, OR ON ICY PATCHES ON THE SECONDARY ROADS I HAVE TO TAKE TO MY APPOINTMENTS.  I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE FROM THE COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET.  THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS DECEMBER 2008 AND SINCE THEN HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES. *TR",

NO DIMMING OR WARNING, LIGHTS JUST WENT OFF AND I WAS DRIVING IN DARKNESS.    02/03/09 TOOK IMPALA TO GM DEALER TO RUN DIAGNOSTIC.  THEY DETERMINED PROBLEM WITH THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL HIGH/LOW BEAM LEVER SWITCH (THIS UNIT ALSO HOUSES THE CRUISE CONTROL, WINDSHIELD WIPERS, AND DIRECTIONAL LIGHT CONTROLS).  EST FOR REPAIRS $735.00.   02/07/09 HAD THE UNIT REPLACED AT ANOTHER GARAGE FOR $435.00.  I KEPT THE DEFECTIVE UNIT.   HAVE SINCE DONE RESEARCH TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE REPORTING THIS SAME PROBLEM OCCURRING ON OTHER IMPALAS RANGING AT LEAST FROM MODEL YEARS 2001 THRU 2005.   IN SOME CASES THE HEADLIGHTS STAYED ON, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SWITCH THE HEADLIGHTS BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW BEAM.  I FEEL THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE.   I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO RELATE WHAT HAPPENED AS I BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.  I FEEL THAT DUE TO THE HIGH POTENTIAL FOR ACCIDENTS INVOLVING INJURY OR EVEN DEATH, THIS MULTIFUNCTIONAL LEVER SWITCH SHOULD BE \"RECALLED\". *TR",
