AT THIS TIME, MR JIM JANICEK, THE DISTRICT MANAGER FOR TUFFY'S WAS PRESENT. AGAIN THEY INSPECTED MY BRAKES AND I WAS ASSURED BY MR. JANICEK THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BRAKES.  AT THIS TIME, MR. JANICEK, THE DISTRICT MANAGER FOR  TUFFY'S STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT I WAS WASTING HIS TIME AND NOT TO RETURN.  ON MAY 29, 2003, ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK I DEVELOPED A LOUD GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM MY LEFT FRONT WHEEL WITH GREATLY REDUCED BRAKING POWER. ON MAY 30, 2003 I AGAIN WAS CHARGED , THIS TIME FOR TWO (2) CALIPERS TO REPAIR BRAKES. I BELIEVE THE CALIPER FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE THE WORK DONE BY TUFFY'S TO BEGIN WITH.ON JULY 8, ON MY WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, AS MY WIFE MUST GO WEEKLY; TRAVELING AT A RATE  OF 30 MPH IN MEDIUM TRAFFIC I HAD COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND WAS BARELY ABLE TO AVOID A MAJOR ACCIDENT. DRIVING AT A RATE OF 10 -15 MPH I WAS ABLE TO TAKE MY CAR TO LYNCH BUICK AT 5330 W. IRVING PARK RD. IN CHICAGO. THEY INSPECTED MY BRAKES AND FOUND THERE TO BE A SUBSTANCE THAT WAS NOT BRAKE FLUID IN THE SYSTEM. THE TOTAL COST OF REPAIR WILL BE OVER $1,000.00. TUFFY'S WAS NOTIFIED AND THEY TOOK A SAMPLE OF THE FLUID FROM THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER. TUFFY'S STATED THE  THE BRAKE SYSTEM HAD ANTI-FREEZE IN IT. TUFFY'S AUTO SERVICE ON NORTH MILWAUKEE IN CHICAGO WAS THE ONLY ONE TO WORK ON MY BRAKES AND THE ONLY ONE UNDER THE HOOD FOR ANY REASON SINCE JANUARY 8, 2003., H DUE TO THE GREAT TRAUMA CAUSED BY TUFFY'SLYNCH BUICK WILL REPAIR MY CAR. WHEN TUFFY' BOTCHED THE FIRST JOB, I GAVE THEM ANOTHER CHANCE, THAT CHANCE ALMOST COST ME AND MY WIFE OUR LIVES. I FEEL THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO ANY MORE BRAKE REPAIRS ON ANY VEHICLES.  *AK",

THEY GAVE ME THE PHONE NUMBER FOR THE BUICK FACTORY (1-800-521-7300) I SPOOKE WITH ALEA WHO GAVE ME THE CLAIM NUMBER OF 980074345 AND SAID THE FACTORY  REP WOULD CALL ME. I GAVE HER TWO PHONE NUMBERS, BOTH WITH ANSWERING MACHINES. I NEVER GOT A CALL FROM THE FACTORY REP. ON 1/14/99 I CALLED BACK TO BUICK AND THEY SAID, \"THE CASE WAS CLOSED\". \"THE REP HAD TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND CLOSED THE CASE.\" I WAS NEVER CONTACTED AND THE CAR SEAT HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED OR INSPECTED. THE DEALER LOOKED AT SOME NEW CARS OF THE SAME MODEL AND SAID THEY HAD SOME SLACK. WHICH IS TRUE, BUT NOT LIKE MINE WHERE THE BACK OF THE SEAT SO MUCH SLACK THAT IT TROWS THE DRIVE FORWARD. THE SITUATION NOW IS THAT EVERY TIME A PERSON STEPS ON THE BRAKE THE FRONT SET BACK FLYS FORWARD AND THROWS THE DRIVER INTO THE STEERING WHEEL. I AM NOT A MECHANIC, BUT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THE EXCESSIVE MOVEMENT OF THE SEAT BACK REST. (THE CAR DOES HAVE AN ELECTRIC SEAT ON THE DIRVER'S SIDE). IT IS VERY DANGEREOUS TO DRIVE THE CAR AND REMEMBER TO LEAN FORWARD EACH TIME THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. WE HAVE TO REMEBER TO WARN EVERY DRIVER OF THE CAR AND HOPE THEY DO NOT FORGET. IT SCARES THE 'WILLIES OUT OF THEM' WHEN IT HAPPENS. THE LOOSE SEAT PROBLEM IS EITHER AN ENGINEERING FAULT OR A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM. THE DEALER SAID IT IS A FACTORY PROBLEM AND THE FACTORY RELIED ON THE DEALER'S WORD RATHER THAN FIX THE PROBLEM. THE DEALER SAYS THE CAR IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND 'SOL' .
