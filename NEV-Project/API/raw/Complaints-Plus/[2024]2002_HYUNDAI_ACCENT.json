AT THE CURRENT TIME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT MORE THAN A FEW OUNCES OF GASOLINE INTO THE CAR AT ANY ONE TIME AND FAILURE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE CHAMBER WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REFUEL CAN LEAD TO GASOLINE OVERFLOW AND SPILLS.

GAS PUMP NOZZLES IN THE UK HAD TO BE CHANGED TO A SMALLER SIZE SO THAT THERE COULD BE SOME VENTING.  THE VENT LINES IN MY CAR SEEM CLEAR.
