It is now at the dealer again, to see what can be done.  There is a known class action suit filed in 2019.  For Ford F250 & F350 models from 2005 to 2019.  Ford knew about it but did not inform any owners.  We are wanting to get this on record so you can monitor Ford to see what they are doing about it. It is a shame that people pay big bucks for the trucks and Ford won't tell owners about it or find a true fix. We are also going to file on the class action suit that is out there.
