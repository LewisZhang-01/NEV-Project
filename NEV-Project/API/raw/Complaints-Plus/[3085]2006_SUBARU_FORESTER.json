NOW TODAY I HAVE ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DEVELOP A FUEL ODOR AND ASSUMING WHEN I INVESTIGATE I WILL FIND ANOTHER LEAK. UPON RESEARCHING I SEE NUMEROUS POSTS IN FORUMS AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS SOME ON YOUR GUYS WEBSITE INDICATING SIMILAR ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR 2003 WRX FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM (09V46800). THIS ISN'T A CAR SPECIFIC ISSUE, THIS IS AN ENGINE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND THE DESIGNS OF ALL OF THESE ENGINES ARE VERY SIMILAR, SO ALL ENGINES WITH RUBBER LINES LOCATED IN THIS AREA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND IS GOING TO COST SOMEONE THEIR LIFE AND/OR CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES WHEN ONE OF THESE CARS BURSTS INTO FLAMES. SUBARU SHOULD BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE WITH THIS ISSUE AND FIX FUEL LINE LEAKS LIKE THIS AT NO COST AND IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS NO REASON A 7 YEAR OLD CAR SHOULD HAVE FUEL LINE FAILURE.

BOTH REAR BEARINGS WORE OUT ON MY CAR AT ALMOST THE SAME EXACT TIME. EVERY MECHANIC WITH WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN SAYS THIS IS COMMON ON THESE VEHICLES.  MY BEARINGS WORE OUT AT ABOUT 70K MILES.  THE SUBARU DEALER CHARGED ME APPROXIMATELY $800 TO REPLACE ONE OF THEM.  THE OTHER COST ABOUT $600 AT AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC.   THE MECHANICS WON'T REPLACE THE BEARINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WARRANTY THE WORK SO YOU END UP REPLACING THE HUB ASSEMBLY.  THAT IS WHY IT COST SO MUCH.  WHEN IT WEARS OUT IT FIRST STARTS TO SQUEAL AND MAKE A NOISE THAT GETS PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AS YOU ACCELERATE TO MODERATE SPEED.  MY CAR NOW HAS 140K MILES AND MY WHEEL BEARINGS HAVE BEGUN MAKING NOISE AGAIN.  AT A COST OF  ($600 - $800) X 2, THIS CLEARLY SEEMS LIKE A POOR DESIGN DEFECT.  I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS OVER THE YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY FOR THE SAME PART IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.  THE PART WORE OUT ALMOST PRECISELY AFTER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED.  EVERY PERSON I KNOW WITH A SUBARU FORESTER HAS THE SAME COMPLAINT.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS FORUMS ON THE WEB FROM OWNERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT.

        "summary": "THIS INCIDENT FIRST OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER MY LAST OIL CHANGE AT ABOUT 38,000 MILES.  DURING FOUR OF THE LAST EIGHT TIMES I HAVE REFUELED MY 2006 SUBARU FORESTER, WHICH NOW HAS ABOUT 40,000 MILES, THE FILLING PUMP HAS NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHUT OFF WHEN MY GAS TANK WAS FULL. AS A RESULT, GASOLINE OVERFLOWED FROM MY FUEL TANK AND SPILLED OUT.  FORTUNATELY, NO FIRE HAS RESULTED, AND I HAVE MANAGED TO DODGE THE SPRAY.   HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SPILLING GASOLINE, AND I FEAR THAT I WILL ONE DAY SPILL GASOLINE ON MYSELF.  THIS HAS HAPPENED AT FOUR DIFFERENT GAS STATIONS OVER THE PAST MONTH, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE WITH MY CAR. THE GAS STATIONS WERE TAYLOR #80 IN AMARILLO, TX; EXXON IN CHILDRESS, TX; LOVE'S IN ENCINAL, TX; AND SHELL AT THE CORNER OF CALTON AND SAN DARIO IN LAREDO, TX, AND THE INCIDENTS OCCURRED ON MAY 9, MAY 19, JUNE 3, AND JUNE 5, RESPECTIVELY.  AGAIN, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE, CHEMICAL INJURY, AND WASTE OF MONEY.    I HAVE NOT CONTACTED SUBARU AS OF YET BECAUSE I WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE PROBLEM WAS WITH MY VEHICLE OR THE GAS STATIONS.  I WILL SOON CONTACT A SUBARU DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS MATTER.  THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY REPORT.  *TR",
