        "summary": "DOMETIC RM 2652 SERIAL # 236-04099    I HAVE ONE OF THE RECALL REFRIGERATORS THAT HAS THE FATIGUE CRACK THAT ALREADY HAPPENED. I'M BEING TOLD BY DOMETIC THAT I HAVE TO REPLACE THE COOLING UNIT IN THE REFRIGERATOR BEFORE THEY WILL PERFORM THE \"RECALL\" WORK. A FATIGUE CRACK IS CAUSED BY A IMPROPERLY DESIGNED UNIT OR WORKMANSHIP SO HOW IS IT THEY ARE BEING ALLOWED TO PUT A SECONDARY BURNER GUARD OR WHAT EVER IT'S CALLED TO PREVENT A FIRE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FIX THE REAL PROBLEM ? THESE COOLING UNITS ARE $600-$900 PLUS INSTALLATION AND THEY STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE OLD ONES ! MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE OVER 900,000 OF THESE REFRIGERATORS AFFECTED @ $600  APIECE (MINE LASTED LESS THAN 5 YRS) DOMETIC HAS QUITE A RACKET GOING ON. I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED THAT COMPANIES CAN SELL A PRODUCT THEY KNOW IS DEFECTIVE AND THEN TELL YOU WELL WE CAN SELL YOU A NEW COOLING UNIT . I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAT HAVE OR GONE THROUGH THE SAME ORDEAL I'M GOING THROUGH. MY RESPONSE FROM DOMETIC WAS THESE THINGS DON'T LAST FOREVER. MY RESPONSE TO YOU IS IT SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 4 CAMPING SEASONS (APRIL- OCTOBER).  *TR",
