THE FIRST BEING  THAT I AM REQUESTING INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE RECALLS  THAT INCLUDE THIS UNIT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO CAMPAIGNS FOR THE 2001 WORKHORSE CHASSIS,  NHTSA # 04V084000, HAVING TO DO WITH  SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC AND # 01V317000, HAVING TO DO WITH   SUSPENSION:REAR:SPRINGS:LEAF SPRING ASSEMBLY:U-BOLT, LEAF SPRING TO AXLE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER OUR UNIT IS INCLUDED AND IF SO, WHY WE WERE NOT NOTIFIED.    THE SECOND REASON I AM WRITING HAS TO DO WITH THE ABS BRAKE SENSORS ON THE FRONT WHEELS.  IN OCTOBER OF 2003, WE HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT BRAKE SENSOR REPLACED AFTER IT HAD BURNED UP WITH ONLY 13,523 MILES ON THE UNIT.  ON JULY 6, 2004, BOTH FRONT ABS BRAKE SENSORS BURNED UP AND REQUIRED REPLACING WITH ONLY 16,367 MILES.  LUCKILY, WE WERE TRAVELING AT A LOW SPEED AS THE LACK OF THE SENSORS APPARENTLY CAUSED BOTH FRONT BRAKES TO LOCK UP, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HAD WE BEEN TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY INSTEAD OF A CITY STREET.    WHILE I REALIZE THAT THE UNIT IS OUT OF THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY, THIS APPEARS TO BE A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT WHEN THE SAME UNITS BURN UP WITHIN 3000 MILES.  I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN TO A FRIEND THAT HAS A 2002 W22 CHASSIS AND SHE HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, CAUSING HER TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT SENSORS.  THESE SENSORS SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO LAST A LOT MORE THAN 16,000 MILES AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN 3,000 MILES.  I FEEL THAT WORKHORSE SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND REIMBURSE US FOR THE COST ($365.35) OF THE REPLACEMENT OF BOTH ABS BRAKE SENSORS.   *LA",
