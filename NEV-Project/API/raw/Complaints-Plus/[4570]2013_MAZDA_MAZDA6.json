The recall covered cars built between October 25, 2012 and May 9, 2013. My car was built 7-19-2012 and the dealer will not fix the issue. I have taken it to a dealer in Cincinnati and they said put a new fuel cap on it which I did. The problem has persisted and has gotten worse. I have taken it to garages where they have merely reset the light and returned it unfixed. I have lived \"because of the Covid\" with the situation over a year and a half by only filling the tank half full. I have only recently discovered the 2014 had a recall but not the 2013. I have spent over a 1000$ trying to get someone to fix it but no body has yet to do the job. It has potential to explode and or catch afire. I am asking for help and reporting Mazda for under recalling and fixing the recall.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

I researched that and it said that when 'low', the check engine will come on but there will probably be no other warnings and that the sensor usually needs to be replaced around 100k miles. my vehicle is at 51k miles. currently have 3k in repairs which does not include the cost of an engine.",

IT IS BASICALLY A PLATE TO KEEP THE ROTTING FRAME FROM SEPARATING COMPLETELY ON ONLY 1 SIDE. THE PROBLEM IS THE ENTIRE FRAME IS STILL ROTTING AT A CRAZY EXCESSIVE RATE. I HAVE HAD MANY USED, OLDER VEHICLES AND HAVE NEVER SEEN A CAR SO NEW ALMOST RENDERED UNDRIVABLE DUE TO THE FRAME CONDITION. MY MECHANIC SAID IT SHOULD HAVE ALL BEEN REPLACED GIVEN HOW MUCH CORROSION/RUST IS ON THE ENTIRE FRAME INSTEAD OF ONLY A BRACKET ON ONE SIDE... AND THE FIX THEY PERFORMED IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LIABILITY TREATMENT TO KEEP THE CAR FROM COMPLETELY FALLING APART AND KILLING SOMEONE WHEN THE FRAME FAILS ON THAT SIDE. THE FRAME WAS LEFT IN PLACE AND IS ROTTING FASTER THAN I HAVE EVEN SEEN ON A VEHICLE ESPECIALLY AT LESS THAN 10YEARS OLD AND LESS THAN 100K MILES. NHTSA NEEDS TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS RECALL AS SOME DEALERS ARE DOING THE BEAR MINIMUM TO 'FIX' THE ISSUE INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE FRAME AS THEY SHOULD BE....SOME OF THE CARS WERE NEWER AND WERE NOT YET EXPERIENCING THE HEAVY RUST AT THE TIME OF THE RECALL BUT FAST FORWARD A YEAR OR TWO AND THE ENTIRE FRAME IS NEARLY JUNK COVERED BY A FANCY METAL PLATE ON ONLY 1 SIDE THAT IS SIMPLY INTENDED TO KEEP THE ROTTING FRAME FROM SEPARATING AND NOTHING ELSE...IT DIDN'T AT ALL 'FIX' THE PROBLEM. I CANNOT SUBMIT PICS RIGHT NOW, BUT GIVEN THIS IS RELATED TO A PREVIOUS RECALL NOT SURE IT IS NECESSARY...LOOK INTO HOW THEY ARE 'BANDAIDING' SOME OF THE 2013'S WHILE REPLACING THE ENTIRE FRAMES ON 2011'S...IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE SAME REPAIR AND THE 'BANDAID' FIX DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM OF PREMATURE ROT ON THE FRAME.
