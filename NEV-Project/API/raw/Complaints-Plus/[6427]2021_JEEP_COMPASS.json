Took to dealer (leased Dec. 2021) with 3,100 miles on it. Told I would have to leave for 72 hours while they figured out what the issue is. (no rental provided). Have not taken in yet.   Drives okay without the lane assist and front camera but you cannot rely on these components. Especially when needed.  No one has inspected yet. Warning lights are still on dashboard.

This is particularly problematic when on a freeway with narrow lanes and lots of traffic.  Sometimes it simply pulls left or right for a brief moment.  Other times, such as when going around a tight curve at a high speed, it pulls strongly for a protracted time.  It didn't cause an accident.  I was able to overcome the pulling forces exerted on the steering wheel by the car, but it made it much more difficult to keep close control of the vehicle location at high speeds.  It is intermittent, but happens typically a few times an hour.",

        "summary": "A noise, coming front the front end of my 2021 Jeep Compass is generated while is driving at low velocity (15 mph or slower). The noise intensity increases when the jeep is driven for over an hour.   I took the jeep to dealer on Nov 3, 2021, with 701 miles to have it checked and repaired. At that moment, the service manager indicated me that the noise is coming from the rack and pinion and the manufacturer has indicated that this noise is normal, but they are consulting this with their engineers. See attached service invoice dated. Nov 3, 2021. On Nov-17, 2021 I went back to the dealer I was able to talk with the service manager and he informed me that their instruction is not to perform any repair until receive a final decision from the manufacturer. At that moment the jeep had 1000 miles. He told me that other 2021 Jeep Compass and Cherokee clients have the same problem.  He did not provide me a repair or invoice receive of this  visit he told me to use previous service invoice if needed for future reference.   If this steering component breaks or got locks, I will lose control and could have an accident. In addition, this is a new car and the front-end sound like an old car. Please help. Thanks",

I pulled into a shopping complex and called the dealer Napleton Chrysler in Clermont, FL and was advised to call Chrysler Roadside Assistant.  I called and a tow truck came and took the vehicle to the dealership.  On 11/06 Greg serviced my vehicle and he said that the battery was faulty and he changed it and he also changed a part in the glove compartment.  I asked him why should a 2021 vehicle has this problem and he said he did not know and he was sending the battery to Chrysler.  I took possession on 11/06.  On 11/07 I drove to work and on coming home the same incident happened.  This time I had to wait about 3 hours for a tow truck to come and then since I had to go to work the next day went to get a rental.  Did not get home until after 10:45pm.  I am still waiting to get a call from the dealership.  This is unacceptable and a serious accident can happen.  I do not want to keep this vehicle.",
