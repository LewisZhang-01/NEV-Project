The part (seatbelt/airbag sensor/pre tensioner) has still not been delivered to the dealer so that they can repair the vehicle. The part being defective prevents the airbag sensor from operating correctly and, as such, the airbags will not work in the event of a collision. This car is my daily driver and has largely been parked idle for 12 months.   For the entire year, I have been fighting with their corporate customer support team and there has been no progress whatsoever on securing the part. They have given me numerous dates for the part to arrive. None of them have been met. No new date has been provided.  The dealer blames Hyundai Corporate, Hyundai Corporate blames the 'distribution centre' and so on.   The car is unsafe with no airbags and there is no resolution in sight.",

OUR 2007 HYUNDAI SONATA NEEDED POWER STEERING FLUID AND BRAKE FLUID ON A REGULAR BASIS.  MOST RECENTLY WE LOST BRAKES AND HAD THE CAR INSPECTED.  THE INSPECTION DETERMINED THAT THE POWER STEERING LINES, BRAKE LINES AND FUEL LINES ARE SEVERELY CORRODED AND ALL LEAKING.  THE BRAKE LINES HAD THE MOST SEVERE CORROSION BUT THE FUEL AND POWER STEERING HAD CORROSION DEEP ENOUGH TO CAUSE A LEAK.  THESE LEAKS ARE NOT IN THE VICINITY OF FITTINGS OR CONNECTIONS.  THE WORST LEAKS ARE IN THE VICINITY OF BRACKETS OR LINE RETAINERS.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD AND OPERATED IN THE NORTHEAST SNOW BELT BUT THE CORROSION IS WORSE THAN MOST VEHICLES THAT ARE MUCH OLDER WITH HIGHER MILEAGE.  CLEARLY THE LINES WERE MADE OF INFERIOR METAL CAUSING THE COMPONENTS TO FAIL PREMATURELY.  APPARENTLY, INSTEAD OF USING A MORE COSTLY RUST RESISTANT METAL THE MANUFACTURER RELIED ON A PLASTIC COATING ON THE LINES TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE ELEMENTS.  THIS COMPLETELY FAILED AS SOME OF THE LINES ARE COMPLETELY CORRODED ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH.  THE PLASTIC COATING LIKELY ACCELERATED THE CORROSION AS IT RETAINED CORROSIVE MATERIALS IN CONTACT WITH THE METAL.    I CONTACTED THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS ON THESE COMPONENTS AND I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PART AND LABOR COSTS.

I TRIED TO ROCK THE STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY WHILE TRIED TO TURN THE KEY WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS. WITHOUT ENGINE POWER, NO STEERING WAS AVAILABLE. FORTUNATELY, MY FRIEND DROPPED US AT OUR HOME. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AT GLASSMAN HYUNDAI IN SOUTHFIELD THE NEXT MORNING (JULY 28) WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SINCE STEERING WAS LOCKED. I SAW A MECHANIC WORKING ON A SIMILAR CAR IN THE PARKING LOT WITH SIMILAR ISSUE AND HE SAID THAT HE WILL BE WORKING ON MY CAR ALSO. HE ALSO SAID THAT IGNITION KEY CYLINDER ARE WEARING OUT AND NEEDS REPLACEMENT. COUNTER PERSON SAID THE KEY CYLINDER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT THE WHOPPING COST OF $650. LATER SHE SAID $850 UPFRONT. LATER DECLINED TO SERVICE AND I HAD TO TOW TO ANOTHER PLACE AND THEY REPLACED KEY CYLINDER FOR $380.    THIS IS DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE SINCE I COULD HAVE BEEN STRANDED ON A FREEWAY AFTER A REST STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT. I HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED THIS ISSUE IN MY 45 YEARS OF DRIVING. I DID SOME INTERNET RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE ON THE SAME CARS. THE SWITCH IS FAULTY AND SEEMS LIKE IT IS WEARING OUT FASTER FOR SOME REASON.   I HAVE ONLY 73K MILES ON IT AND THE CAR SITS IN THE GARAGE MOST OF THE TIME. THE DEALER SAYS THAT IT IS NOT COVERED. I THINK HYUNDAI SHOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THIS ISSUE FOR ALL 2007 SONATA VEHICLE. I THINK HYUNDAI SHOULD OWN THIS ISSUE AND REPLACE THE CYLINDER LOCKS ON ALL SUCH VEHICLES AT NO COST TO THE OWNERS.",

A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THAT AND THEREFORE WILL NOT GET IT FIXED. WHICH MEANS HYUNDAI IS GOING TO EVENTUALLY GET SUED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.

WITH IN 2 DAYS I TOOK THE CAR TO AAMCO SINCE THERE WAS A $35 BRAKE PAD SERVICE DEAL. I WAS TOLD AFTER INSPECTION THAT A CALIPER PISTON IS SEIZED AND SO THE CALIPERS, THE DAMAGED ROTORS AND OF COURSE THE BRAKE PADS HAVE TO BE REPLACED - PREFERABLY FOR BOOTH RARE WHEELS, IN ORDER TO HAVE SIMILAR BRAKING CHARACTERISTICS. WHILE IT IS COMMON SENSE THAT THE FRONT BRAKE PADS WOULD WEAR FASTER, THE AAMCO FOLKS WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE REAR BRAKE SYSTEM IN SUCH A BAD CONDITION WHILE THE ORIGINAL FRONT BRAKES WERE STILL GOOD. PER THEIR OPINION IT IS MOSTLY DUE TO A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. I CALLED HYUNDAI WARRANTY IMMEDIATELY, THEY PROVIDED A CASE NUMBER, BUT I WAS TOLD I WAS OUT OF LUCK SINCE I AM JUST PAST 60K MILES AND ALSO THERE IS NO RECALL SPECIFIC TO REAR BRAKES THAT WILL ADDRESS MY CONCERN. WITH THIS I THOUGHT I LOST ALL MY BRAGGING RIGHTS ABOUT HYUNDAI - ON THEIR RELIABILITY AND VALUE FOR THE MONEY. MOREOVER, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE SINCE ON A 1997 NISSAN ALTIMA WHICH I OWN, I STILL HAVE 25% LEFT ON THE REAR BRAKES AT 125K MILES. SHORTLY LATER I FOUND SCORES OF SONATA OWNERS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE INTERNET FORUMS AS WELL AS NHTSA SITE. I ALSO FOUND COMPLAINTS ABOUT SUN VISORS NOT STAYING IN PLACE, HANGING LOOSELY, A HAZARD WHILE DRIVING. I HAVE THIS PROBLEM TOO BUT NEVER PAYED MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. CURRENTLY I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO SHELL OUT OVER $600 DOLLARS TO GET THE REAR BRAKE ISSUE FIXED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE MYSELF AND MY FAMILY SAFELY IN THE CAR. I HOPE MY COMPLAINT BREACHES THE THRESHOLD AND NHTSA TAKES ACTION TO HAVE HYUNDAI FIX THE ISSUE AT HYUNDAI'S COST ASAP. THANKS FOR PROVIDING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOG THE COMPLAINT.",

GREAT SERVICE!! NOW IT SEEMS WHENEVER IT GETS REALLY HOT IT DOES THIS OFTEN. I HAVE GOTTEN STRANDED SO MANY TIME AND HAVE HAD OTHERS HELP ME.

THEY FOUND B1706 ERROR (THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT BUCKLE RESISTANCE WAS HIGH) SO THEY REPLACED THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT BUCKLE ASSEMBLY WITH NO CHARGE. ON 6/8/12 (61,000 MILES) I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. THE TECHNICIAN FOUND CODES: B1448, B1701 AND B1706.THE REPAIRS WERE NOT COVER BY WARRANTY AND WOULD COST $800. I DECLINED THE WORK. BEFORE I LEFT THEY TOLD ME THAT THE AIRBAGS MAY NOT DEPLOY IF I WERE IN AN ACCIDENT. LAST MONTH I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A RECALL OF 2007 HYUNDAI SONATA BACK IN APRIL 2008 TO REPLACE THE AIRBAG SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SEAT CUSHION WHICH CAUSED THE AIRBAG LIGHT TO REMAIN ON. TODAY (7/18/2014), (91,000 MILES) I TOOK MY CAR IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE RECALL REPAIR AND THEY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE FRONT PASSENGER CUSHION AIRBAG SENSOR AND WITH BOTH SEAT BELT BUCKLE SENSORS. THEY WILL SHIP THE FRONT PASSENGER CUSHION SEAT TO CALIFORNIA TO FIX THE AIRBAG SENSOR PROBLEM FOR FREE BUT IT WOULD COST $630 TO REPLACE BOTH SEAT BELT BUCKLE ASSEMBLIES. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IF I DECLINED TO REPLACE BOTH SEAT BELT SENSORS THAT THE AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY IF I EVER GET INTO AN ACCIDENT.  WELL, I CANNOT AFFORD THE REPAIR. IT IS A SAD SITUATION. HYUNDAI MUST KNOW BY NOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT BELT ASSEMBLY, IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET. IT SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT MONEY AND THAT HYUNDAI IS PAYING FOR THE COST OF RECALL REPAIRS FOR THE SEAT CUSHION SENSOR BY CHARGING FOLKS TO HAVE THE SEAT BELT ASSEMBLIES REPLACED. I'M SURE SOME LAWYER WILL FIND OUT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND FIND PEOPLE INJURED DUE TO THE SEAT BELT ASSEMBLY MALFUNCTIONS AND FILE A LAWSUIT. I JUST HOPE NO ONE DIES BECAUSE OF IT.    *TR",

I DON'T SEE WHAT REPLACING THE BUCKLES WOULD DO, IF THERE IS AN OPEN SHORT THAT IS CAUSING THEM TO SHORTEN OUT.   HYUNDAI CURRENTLY HAS A RECALL FOR AIRBAG LIGHT (ISSUE WITH THE PASSENGER AIR BAG BEING DE-ACTIVATED). I TOOK MY CAR IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE RECALL TODAY, AND THEY ARE GOING TO SHIP THE FRONT PASSENGER CUSHION SEAT TO CALIFORNIA TO FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR FREE. HOWEVER THE ISSUE WITH THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BUCKLE ASSEMBLY IS STILL NOT BEING COVERED.  AFTER READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS FROM OWNERS OF THE 2007 HYUNDAI SONATA, FOR THE SAME ISSUE, HOW CAN THERE NOT BE SAFETY RECALL REGARDING THIS ISSUE? THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THE AIRBAGS WILL DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT WHILE THIS PROBLEM EXISTS. DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE ACTION IS TAKEN?   MANY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!  *TR",

THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP CHANGED MY OIL AND MY CAR TURNED BACK ON, KNOCKING, BUT ON. I HAD ANOTHER MECHANIC LOOK AT IT, AND HE SAID THERE WAS NO OIL IN IT, SO I KNOW THE FILTER IS SUCKING IT UP.

AS I COMMUNICATED MY CONCERNS TO HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA, THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND BECAUSE THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WOULD ONLY DEAL WITH CALIBRATION, IT WAS MY COST TO REPAIR. TO ME THIS ISSUE IS CLEARLY IN THE AREA OF DEFECT IN MATERIAL FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND NOT CAUSED BY MY ACTIONS OR NEGLECT.

MY DEALER DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER AS TO WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS BEING DONE TO CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.    I FIND IT DISTURBING THAT THROUGH DOING A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET FOR \"HYUNDAI VISOR PROBLEMS\", THERE ARE OTHERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION OFFERED. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN INJURY, OR LOSS OF LIFE, NOT ONLY IN MY VEHICLE, BUT IN OTHER VEHICLES INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AS A RESULT OF THE PROBLEM MENTIONED.  *TR",

I HAVEN'T REPLACED THEM YET BECAUSE OF COST. SHOULD I STOP DRIVING THE CAR ? WASN'T FIRESTONE IN TROUBLE FOR FAULTY TIRES ? WHAT ABOUT OTHER DRIVERS OUT THERE WITH A SIMILAR SITUATION ? I JUST THINK THAT A CAR'S TIRES SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP LONGER THAN 29 MONTHS AND 14,000 MILES. PLEASE ADVISE. [XXX] *TR",

ONE EVENING MY HUSBAND AND I DROVE THE CAR TO THE DEALER TO SHOW THEM THAT THE AIRBAG OFF LIGHT WAS ON WHILE I WAS SEATED IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE ASST SERV MGR WAS THERE AND CONFIRMED THAT THE LIGHT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  ON 9/23/09 I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND WAS MET BY THE CENTRAL REGION DIST PTS & SVC MGR WHO DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH ME.  HE SUGGESTED THINGS TO TRY (HAVING THE BACK OF THE SEAT IN THE STRAIGHT UP POSITION, BEING SURE TO BE SEATED IN THE CENTER OF THE SEAT, SITTING STILL FOR A FEW SECONDS AFTER STARTING THE CAR TO BE SURE EVERYTHING HAD ENGAGED PROPERLY).  HE SAID WE SHOULD LET HIM KNOW IF NONE OF THIS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM.  NONE OF THESE SUGGESTIONS HELPED SO WE AGAIN CONTACTED THE CNTRL RGN DIST PTS & SVC MGR AS INSTRUCTED.  AFTER PHONE CALLS AND DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN HIM AND MY HUSBAND WE HAVE NOW BEEN ADVISED THAT NOTHING ELSE WILL BE DONE.  OUR CONCERNS ARE: HOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER THE AIRBAG WILL WORK IF A CRASH SHOULD OCCUR?  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THE AIRBAG ITSELF IS OK, BUT IF THAT'S TRUE THEN WHY CAN'T WE GET THAT IN WRITING?  IF IT'S JUST THE LIGHT THAT'S DEFECTIVE, WHY WON'T SOMEONE FIX IT?  WHAT ARE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS IF A PASSENGER SHOULD BE INJURED IN OUR CAR SINCE WE ARE UNSURE IF THE AIRBAG WILL WORK OR NOT? *TR",

(REAR BRAKES HAD BEEN REPLACED ALREADY IN 7/08).  AT THE TIME, FRONT BRAKES WERE MEASURED AT 60% REMAINING AND REAR 90% REMAINING.

MY CAR IS A FEW MONTHS OVER 2 YEARS OLD, SO THAT DID NOT APPLY TO ME.  THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH MY MODEL CAR, BUT I HAD NO WARNING.

I WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND WAS NEARLY HIT BY A TRUCK BECAUSE I COULD NOT MOVE THE VEHICLE!  LUCKILY, I REMEMBERED HOW TO REMOVE THE SMALL COVER OVER THE MANUAL DISENGAGEMENT POINT AND WAS ABLE TO USE A LEATHERMAN TOOL TO DEACTIVATE THE SHIFT LOCK SYSTEM AND PLACE THE CAR IN REVERSE.
