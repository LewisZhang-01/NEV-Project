UPON BLOWOUT, THE TIRE SHREDDED FROM THE CENTER, CAUSING UNDERCARRIAGE DAMAGE TO THE UNIT. LUCKILY, THE BLOWOUT WAS FROM THE INSIDE DUAL ON THE REAR. I WOULD HATE TO SAY WHAT DAMAGE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED IF EITHER ON OUTER OR FRONT, AS THE STEEL BELTS POUNDED FOR A PROTRUSION FROM THE TIRE FOR ABOUT 8-12 INCHES EXTENDING FROM THE CENTER OF THE TIRE.  *TR",
