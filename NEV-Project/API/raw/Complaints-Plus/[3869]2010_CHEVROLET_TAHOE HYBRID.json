All of the auto locks go up and down, while the cluster goes in and out with very high rpms and then completely loses power in the middle of the road. Or this happens and the steering gets very tough.  It is very dangerous because there are times where it happens on the highway while doing up to 80mph.  It also happens when sitting at line to pick up my child in pre-k.  If it were to jump and the brakes weren\u2019t hit fast enough it could really cause a horrible and possibly deadly situation.  I have done everything that I can on my end with this truck. I recently replaced the battery and replaced the master fuse since reading it was the cause.  That lasted for a week.   I have read hundreds of owners with the same problems that have went to private owned mechanic shops along with gm certified mechanic shops.  They have yet to find an answer to this possibly deadly malfunction.  There are posts and websites all over sharing other owners with the same problems and all of their stories end the same.  That gm along with any mechanic used has yet to find any results to this.  I noticed that the 2015 model has a recall for this problem but doesn\u2019t describe what is being done to fix the actual problem. It has the same engine and setup as far as I can see so I wonder why there isn\u2019t a recall for the 2010.  I have two school age children that  have to be brought to and picked up from school daily.  If you look up this problem online you will find endless stories and questions about the issue at hand.  Most people end up spending thousands of dollars trying to fix the problem on  new batteries, cables, starters, etc.  However, they all end up with the problem being unresolved with all of that unnecessary  debt.  This is a very serious manner and I feel that it\u2019s only a matter of time before lives are lost over this.  I thank you for the opportunity to be heard and pray that a resolution comes sooner than later.",

I HAVEN'T HAD ANY CRACKING OFF OF SHARDS, BUT AS THE TRUCK WAS REGULARLY GARAGED, PARKED IN A PARKING GARAGE AT WORK, & NOW IN A CARPORT, IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HAVE THINGS OCCUR WITHOUT THE BLAZING SUN TO CONTRIBUTE.   UNLIKE OTHERS, I HAVEN'T HAD MAJOR CUTS OR FLYING PIECES, JUST SMALL CUTS TO FINGERS WHEN I FORGETFULLY AM WIPING DOWN THE DASH.  I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES AS THINGS HAVE PROGRESSED ON THE DASH & INITIALLY THEY SAID IT WAS UNFORTUNATE & TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL ONE (PASSENGER AIRBAG AREA), BUT AS THERE ARE NOW MORE ISSUES WITH THE DASH, THEY SAY TO TAKE IT UP WITH GM DIRECTLY.

BATTERY DIES WHEN CAR IS PARKED.   3. KEY REMOTE SOMETIMES WORK AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.     WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE LOCATION WHERE THE NEW BATTERY WAS INSTALLED AND THEY INSTALLED A NEW ONE. ISSUES CONTINUE SO WE STARTED TO DO RESEARCH.   WE FOUND OUT THAT SOME CHEVROLET VEHICLES HAVE ISSUES  OF COMPATIBILITY WITH THE NEGATIVE CABLE OF AFTER-MARKET BATTERIES SO WE BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP IN ELDERSBURG MD.
