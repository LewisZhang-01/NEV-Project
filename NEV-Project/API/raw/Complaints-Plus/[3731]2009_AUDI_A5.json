THE HEADLINER HAD TO BE REPLACED AT LEAST ONCE (IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED OTHER TIMES, BUT THE DEALERSHIP ONLY CLEANED THE STAINS). THE SUNSHADE HAD TO BE REPLACED/REPAIR TWICE BECAUSE IT WAS DAMAGED DURING MANIPULATION OF THE HEADLINER, AND THE SUNROOF HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS DAMAGED, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED DUE TO SQUEAKING.  THIS SUNROOF CONTINUES TO HAVE DRAINAGE ISSUES AFTER A HEAVY RAIN, WHICH RESULTS IN WATER LEAKAGE ONTO AND STAINING THE HEADLINER.  EACH TIME THE DEALERSHIP STATES THAT THE DRAINS WERE BLOCKED AND NEEDED CLEANING, BUT THE CAR IS MOSTLY GARAGED KEPT AND IS NOT EXPOSED TO A LOT OF TREE LITTER. I ASKED IF THERE IS A PERMANENT FIX, AND I'VE CONTACTED AUDI USA REGARDING THIS ISSUE ASKING FOR A PERMANENT FIX OR REPURCHASE/REPLACEMENT OF THE VEHICLE TO WHICH THEY RESPONSE WAS NO THEY CAN'T HELP ME OR RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY SUGGESTED THAT I WORK WITH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER, WITH WHOM I'VE ALREADY WORKED WITH AND THEY'VE BEEN HELPFUL, BUT IF IT IS A DESIGN FLAW, THEN AUDI USA SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM PERMANENTLY OR BUYBACK THE VEHICLES AND MAKE THEIR CONSUMERS WHOLE.
