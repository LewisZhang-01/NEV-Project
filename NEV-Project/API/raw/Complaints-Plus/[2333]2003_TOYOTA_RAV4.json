TOYOTA SAID THEY COULD REPLACE THE ECM IF IT WAS BEFORE 150,000 MILES, WHICH IT WAS NOT.      THEY TOLD ME THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING AFTER 150,000 MILES, NOT EVEN MEET ME HALF WAY TO PAY TO REPLACE IT.  ITS AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM IF THEY SENT A LETTER OUT.  I'VE HAD IT TO THREE REPAIR (INCLUDING A TOYOTA DEALER) SHOPS AND NONE OF THEIR 'COMPUTER CHECKS' SHOW ANYTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  HOW DO YOU FIX SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT?  THEY HAVE DONE TUNE UPS, REPLACED THE OXYGEN SENSOR AND MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO NO HELP.  I'VE SPENT OVER $1,000 IN REPAIRS FOR \"NOTHING\" -OR MAYBE THIS IS IT. I DRIVE 2-LANE HIGHWAYS AND IT IS GOING TO STRAND ME SOMEPLACE, IF I DON'T GET REAR-ENDED BY A SEMI-TRUCK BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AND I AM AFRAID TO LET MY TEENAGERS DRIVE IT.    THE CAR IS STILL IN BEAUTIFUL SHAPE, HAS BEEN GARAGED MOST OF ITS LIFE, HAS HAD REGULAR OIL CHANGES, ETC.

THEY QUOTED ABOUT $4700.00 TO REPLACE THE ECM AND PUT IN A REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  NO FINANCIAL HELP FROM THE DEALER, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE AWARE THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE 2001-2003 RAV4'S. TOYOTA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY A FEW YEARS AGO TO 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES, WHICH EVER CAME FIRST.  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, NOT AWARE THAT THIS WAS A DOCUMENTED AND EXPECTED PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THE DEALER SUGGESTED I CONTACT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AT 1-800-331-4331 AND ASK THEM TO CONSIDER COVERING ALL OR PART OF THE COST.  THE VEHICLE HAS A VALUE OF $7500.00 PER KBB.  I CALLED AND GOT CASE # 1403130959.  I SPOKE TO RASHINE .  IT TOOK A FEW DAYS BUT THEY GOT BACK TO ME AND SAID BECAUSE IT EXCEEDED THE 10 YEAR WINDOW (2003-2013) THEY WOULD NOT COVER ANY OF THE COSTS.  I PLEADED THAT I HAVE WELL UNDER THE 150,000 MILE MARK AND THAT THEY READILY SAY 80% OF ALL TOYOTA'S ARE ON THE ROAD FOR 20 YEARS.  THIS HAS ANOTHER 10 YEARS TO GO.  THEY KNOW THIS IS AND HAS BEEN A FACTORY DESIGN FAULT PER ALL THE RECORDED PROBLEMS.  I DON'T FEEL  I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY $4700.00 IN REPAIRS FOR THEIR DESIGN FAILURE.  IN THEIR 1.2 BILLION $ RECENT SETTLEMENT,THEY SAID\" PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST\", \"WANT TO EARN OUR TRUST\", \"SERVE CUSTOMERS\" \"TAKE RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY\".  WOW, WHAT A LIE AND LET DOWN.  HOW CAN THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS?  IT HAS HAPPENED TO COUNTLESS 1000'S OF PEOPLE.  TOYOTA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS A RECALL AND FIX FOR 0$.

THE SUV WAS SHIFTING OUT OF GEAR AUTOMATICALLY AND I FEARED FOR MY SAFETY AS I WAS IN MOVING TRAFFIC AND I WAS HAVING TROUBLE MOVING.  I IMMEDIATELY DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER.  LUCKILY, THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSE TO WHERE I WAS.  THEY KEPT MY CAR FROM APPROX. 3:30 PM THAT FRIDAY UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.  AT FIRST, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION AND SAID THEY NEEDED UNTIL MONDAY TO KNOW FOR SURE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE REP. TO NOT WORRY, THAT IT MAY BE FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN I THINK.  THAT MONDAY, I GOT A CALL FROM THE SERVICED REP THAT HE HAD BOTH GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.  THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM -  AN ECU PROBLEM BUT THAT I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE.  I TOLD THEM TO GO AHEAD AND INSTALL IT AS I COULDN'T SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE.  THE WORK WAS DONE AND THE FINAL COST FOR THE UNIT AND LABOR WAS $1,300.00.  I TOLD THE SERVICE REP THAT I FELT SHAFTED BECAUSE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED AFTER 80,000 AND I HAD 84,000 MILES AT THE TIME.  FURTHER, I HAD THE SUV FOR JUST 7 YEARS, NOT THE LIMIT OF 8 YEARS UNDER THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY FOR THE ECU.  I WENT ON THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED THE NY TIMES JULY, 2010 LETTER ANNOUNCING MANY PROBLEMS LIKE MINE WITH TRANSMISSION DAMAGE AS WELL AND TOYOTA WOULD NOW COVER IT ALL.  ACCORDING TO THE LETTER, TOYOTA HAD EXTENDED ITS WARRANTY FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO 150,000 MILES AND 10 YEARS FOR THE ECU !  I CALLED THE SERVICE REP AND HE SAID TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS REP WAS THERE AND SAID I HAD NO EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THE SERVICE MANAGER NEVER RETURNED MY CALL.

WHILE RESEARCHING THE INTERNET IN REGARDS TO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON 2003 TOYOTA RAV4, I STUMBLED UPON HUNDREDS OF CONSUMERS COMPLAINTS FOR THE EXACT PROBLEMS. I HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH HARSH SYMPTOMS BEFORE THE ENGINE LIGHT AND, UNSAFE AND HARSH DRIVING CONDITIONS.  AS I CONTINUED MY RESEARCH EFFORTS, I IMMEDIATELY LINKED INTO A FEW TOYOTA TSBS CONCERNING A DEFECTED ECM/PCM REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE TO THE FAILING COMPONENTS AS TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE & POWER TRAIN CONTROL MODULE W/THE DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES. I HAVE SERVICED THE VEHICLE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, AND NEVER INFORMED OF ANY OF THE NUMEROUS TOYOTA TSBS. IT'S DISHONEST, AND LACKS INTEGRITY NOT TO FORMALLY INFORM THE LOYAL CONSUMERS OF THE DEFECTION AND THE SAFETY ISSUES & TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  IN WRITTEN FORMAT, I AM JUSTIFIABLY AND LEGITIMATELY REQUESTING PROPER AND HONEST RAMIFICATION TO THIS UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE MANUFACTURER'S DEFECTION IN WORKMANSHIP OF MY 2003 RAV4. THE PURCHASE OF A NEW AUTO WAS TO ASSURE MYSELF PEACE OF MIND OF SAFETY & QUALITY. A LETTER WILL BE MAIL OUT TOMORROW TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE.*TR",

THE WARRANTY COVERED THE $4000 REPLACEMENT COST OF A NEW TRANSMISSION. AFTER PICKING UP THE VEHICLE IT SEEMED TO RUN OK BUT STILL HAD SHIFTING PROBLEMS AT THE SPEED OF 20-30. A HARSH JERKING. OUR DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND AGAIN IT STOPPED WORKING IN A BUSINESS DISTRICT. SO BACK TO THE SHOP. WELL NOW WE ARE STUMPED ON WHAT COULD BE WRONG. EVEN HAD 2 SENSORS REPLACED AND STILL THE SAME PROBLEM. SO WE HAVE A TOYOTA, WHICH WE BOUGHT FOR OUR TEENAGE DAUGHTERS BECAUSE OF THEIR REPUTATION OF BEING A GREAT VEHICLE, BUT NOW WORRIED WHAT IT WILL DO AS THEY ARE DRIVING IT. SO THE LATEST IS I DID SOME OF MY OWN RESEARCH ON THIS YEAR VEHICLE. CAME ACROSS A WEBSITE CALLED RAV4WORLD. THERE ARE PAGES OFF COMPLAINTS ON TRANSMISSION FAILURES FOR RAV4 2001-2003. I GUESS TOYOTA DIDN'T DO A RECALL FOR A SUPPOSEDLY DEFECTIVE ECM THAT IS THE MAIN COMPUTER IN CAR AND IT IS LEADING TO TRANSMISSION FAILURE. TOYOTA DID PUT OUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON REPLACEMENT WHICH IS 96MONTHS OR 80,000 MILES. OUR CAR IS AT 84K. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DRIVING THIS CAR AND HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS DEFECTIVE ECM IS DESTROYING THE TRANSMISSION??? ALSO IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE! *TR",

MAD HATTERS DID REPAIR AND CLEARED OFF CODES AND CAR DROVE FINE FOR 48 HOURS.

I ALMOST GOT HIT BY ANOTHER CAR WAITING TO TURN AFTER ME AND A WOMAN BEHIND ME.  I PRAYED I WOULD MAKE IT HOME.  CALLED TOYOTA TOOK IT BACK TO MAD HATTERS AT THEIR SUGGESTION.  MAD HATTERS CHECKED AND INDICATED IT WAS A TRANSMISSION CODE.  WE CALLED TOYOTA TO IMMEDIATELY TOW IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  TOYOTA CALLED AND INDICATE IT IS THE EMC AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY, CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  $1300.  I RESEARCHED AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AS WELL AS A OLD TOYOTA SERVICE BULLETIN SO THEY KNOW THIS PROBLEM EXISTED.  TWO WEEKS LATER AFTER I GOT THE MONEY TOGETHER I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP MY CAR.  THEY REPLACED THE COMPUTER MODULE AND THE CAR SEEMS TO DRIVE FINE, ALTHOUGH AFTER PICKING IT UP I DROVE FOR 10 MILES AND NOW THE ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AGAIN.

I ALSO PURCHASED OUT WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE THREE-YEAR WARRANTY, AND A ONE-YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN. I HAVE CONTINUED TO GET OIL CHANGES AND TUNE-UPS AT REGULAR INTERVALS.    THE CAR IS AT ABOUT 93,000 MILES. ON FRIDAY, JULY 18, I WAS DRIVING TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT, AND QUITE SUDDENLY, IT BEGAN SHIFTING IMPROPERLY. IN THE LOWER GEARS, IT LURCHED AND BUCKED AS IF IT WAS HAVING TROUBLE CATCHING. IMMEDIATELY, I DROVE TO EMPORIA MOTORS, THE LOCAL TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER. IT WAS ABOUT 11 AM. EMPORIA MOTORS WAS TOO BUSY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BY THE END OF THE BUSINESS DAY. THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE AND THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ME WITH A LOANER, SO I HAD TO DO WITHOUT A VEHICLE OVER THE WEEKEND.    ON MONDAY, JULY 21AT AT 8:30 AM, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSAXLE/TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE PART NEEDED WAS ESTIMATED AT $3,450.00. AFTER RUNNING AN INTERNET SEARCH AT WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM, I FOUND THAT THERE WERE 103 COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS ON THE 2002 RAV4, MOST OF WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON PROBLEMS WITH SHIFTING, OFTEN OCCURRING WHEN THE VEHICLE'S MILEAGE REACHED THE 90,000 MARK. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A RANDOM PROBLEM, THE COSTS OF THOSE REPAIRS TO OTHER CONSUMERS ARE COMPARABLE TO MINE, AND YET, TOYOTA HAS NOT TAKEN ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR THIS PROBLEM.    THE VEHICLE IS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD AND I HAVE NOT EVEN FINISHED PAYING IT OFF, AND NOW I'LL HAVE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT. THE HIGH COST OF THIS UNEXPECTED REPAIR IS A SERIOUS BURDEN IN THESE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS CAR. I LIVE IN A RURAL STATE AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT MY CAR IS RELIABLE AND THAT ITS QUALITY IS BACKED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD THAT MY CARPETING WAS TOTALLY RUINED (ITS MOLDY) AND ALL OF IT HAS TO BE REPLACED. I AM ASTHMATIC AND VERY ALLERGIC TO MOLD, THEREFORE ITS A HEALTH HAZARD.

THIS PART OR PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE. THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THEY WILL TRY TO SPEAK WITH THE FACTORY TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE BUT AT THIS POINT ITS UNKNOWN.
