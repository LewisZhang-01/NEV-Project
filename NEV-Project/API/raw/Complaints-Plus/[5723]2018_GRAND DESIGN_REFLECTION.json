        "summary": "While towing my rv, the weld that secures the rear axle springs broke. This weld was located on the right rear side of the frame and it snapped completely off the Lippert frame. It allowed the rear axle to move forward and the two tires on the right side contacted each other and the tires started to disintegrate. A tire on the left side was forced out of alignment and the tire shaved rubber until the steel belts were visible. These tires were high grade tires with less than 5000 miles on them.  I stopped for fuel and noticed the damage. If I had continued the tires would surely have had a catastrophic failure shortly. This would have certainly resulted in a loss of control and a probable crash at highway speed. Since the tires were rubbing it is also likely a fire could have resulted.  I was unable to have the vehicle moved to a repair location and no mobile rv techs would respond since I was in a remote location. I had to hire a local welder to reattach the weld and reinforce the frame on both sides.  In speaking with my insurance company it was determined that this is not an unusual problem with welds breaking.  The vehicle was not inspected by police as no other individuals or property was involved. Photos of the damage and broken weld were sent to Grand Design and Lippert, the manufacturer of the frame.  Photos taken of the repairs performed by the welder were also sent to them. In addition to repairing the broken weld, I had the welder reinforce the left side of the frame holding the axle springs in place so that it would not fail. The unit is now much safer than it was before the repair.  There were no warning lights or symptoms for this problem. I stopped purely by chance for fuel and noticed the steel belts protruding through my tires and this is the only thing that stopped a catastrophic failure and probable crash. The trailer has never been overloaded, and was never driven faster than 65. It has never been in an accident.",
