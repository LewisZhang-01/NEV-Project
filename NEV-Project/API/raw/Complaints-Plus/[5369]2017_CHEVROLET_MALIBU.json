        "summary": "My 2017 Malibu suddenly had the \"check engine\" light come on, and a message indicating that a \"reduced power mode\" had been initiated. I drove the car immediately to the local dealer, who said I needed an appointment to have it checked. I checked the OBD2 codes with my personal meter, which showed a p2138 code, indicating a problem with a throttle body sensor. When I started my car the next morning the MIL light didn't come on. At the dealer I was told they couldn't do anything with the car because the light wasn't on. I pointed out that the failure codes were stored in the ECM, but they said diagnosis wasn't possible with the light off.  The service writer indicated the problem was not uncommon on GM cars and that even his wife's car had similar problems. When this occurred I was fortunate to be on a local suburban road where reduced speed was not that great of a problem. Much of the time I am on freeways in several major Midwestern cities where aggressive drivers are  packed together. I read a number of complaints on the NHTSA site indicating same complaints from Malibu owners. A sudden reduction of speed in a congested area is a recipe for disaster. The service writer even stated that GM had an extended warranty on the pedal assembly and TPI sensors. But he refused to try and diagnose the issue, unless I brought the car in immediately    if and when the MIL light was illuminated, even if I was 500 miles away.  As this intermittent behavior  is a known and common issue I feel that GM should be compelled to do something to correct these defects before a truly dangerous incident occurs, causing devastating results. But I'm sure that this will go on until misfortune causes those in power to ask. Why didn't somebody do something?",

I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP  THEY SAID IT WAS A DIRTY SPEED SENSOR.

THE  CAR ISHOWED A MESSAGE \"NO REMOTE DETECTED: IT WOULD CRANK BUT NOT START . BEING THAT THE CAR WARRENTY WAS ALREADY EXPIRED I HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL MECHANICS SHOP WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A CODE READING \"BRAKE BOOSTER SENSOR\" THEY DISCOVERED A SHATTERED VACUUM PUMP.

WHEN I PUT MY CAR IN PARK, IT DOESN'T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE IT'S IN PARK. THIS MEANS THAT MY CAR WILL NOT TURN OFF, AND I CAN'T LEAVE MY CAR UNTIL IT RECOGNIZES IT'S IN PARK. I'VE FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPEN IF I TRY TO TURN OFF MY CAR ENGINE \"TOO SOON\". I HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT A MINUTE BEFORE I CAN TURN OFF MY ENGINE, OR I RISK MY CAR NOT RECOGNIZING IT'S IN PARK. IF THIS HAPPENS, SOMETIMES I ONLY HAVE TO PRESS ON MY BREAK. OTHER TIMES I HAVE TO TURN THE ENGINE BACK ON, DRIVE, AND WAIT BEFORE TRYING TO TURN MY ENGINE OFF AGAIN. THIS CAN TAKE MULTIPLE TRIES, MULTIPLE MINUTES WORTH OF JUST TRYING TO PARK MY CAR AND TURN IT OFF. I DO COMMUTE ABOUT 70 MILES ROUND TRIP FOR WORK EACH DAY (MONDAY-FRIDAY), SO I USE MY CAR QUITE A BIT, BUT LIKE I MENTIONED I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW AND TAKE THE BEST CARE OF IT.

AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, IT WAS FOUND THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE TO GM FOR MULTIPLE MODELS AND YEARS OF VEHICLES PER SERVICE BULLETIN 19-NA-206.  BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, THE INITIALLY INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM QUICKLY TURNS INTO A PERMANENT, DISABLING PROBLEM.  IN ADDITION, A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED THAN WHAT'S LISTED ON THE SERVICE BULLETIN: (A) SCRAPING DEPOSITS OFF THE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS WITH YOUR THUMB 50 TIMES TO SEE IF THAT WORKS, (B) INSTALLING A JUMPER TO SEE IF THAT WORKS, OR (C) REPLACING THE SHIFTER CONTROL ASSEMBLY.  MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THE DESIGN OF THE NEW ASSEMBLY IS THE SAME, THE PROBLEM WILL REAPPEAR IN A FEW YEARS WITH THE REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLY; ALL ARE JUST TEMPORARY STOP GAP MEASURES.  A REAL FIX THAT PREVENTS THE CORROSION/DEPOSITS IS NEEDED, AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.",

WHEN I TURNED THE CAR ON, THERE WAS A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BUT IT RAN FINE. THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY TURNED OFF. THE CAR RAN FINE UNTIL THE EVENING OF MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2019. THIS TIME THE REDUCED ENGINE POWER CONDITION OCCURRED AS I WAS IN TRAFFIC COMMUTING HOME FROM WORK, MOVING AT A LOW SPEED. LUCKILY THE ROAD WASN'T BUSY AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A GAS STATION. I POWERED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON, AND IT RAN FINE ALL THE WAY HOME. BASED ON SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I BELIEVE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR IS FAILING. THIS APPEARS TO BE A WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES. I WILL BE REPLACING THE PART ON MY OWN.

THAT IS NOT  FIX I AM WILLING TO SETTLE FOR. WHAT ABOUT THE MONTHLY OBLIGATION I HAVE IN TERMS OF PAYING OFF THIS CAR? NONE OF THE TECHNICIANS WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THIS IS AND I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS DOLLARS IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE THIS CAR LOOKED AT.

AS I WAS MERGING ON THE ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AND THE MESSAGE SAYING \"REDUCED ENGINE POWER\" CAME ON AGAIN. I LOST THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATED AND PULLED OVER. I THEN TURNED MY CAR ON AND OFF AGAIN. THE ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED LIT AND THE \"REDUCE ENGINE POWER\" MESSAGE REMAINED ON THIS TIME. I WAS ABLE TO ACCELERATE TO A MAX OF 35 MPH THIS TIME. I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE SAME CHEVY DEALERSHIP.  THEY RAN DIAGNOSTICS ON IT AND THIS TIME THEY STATED IT COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE COLD WEATHER AND SAID A OIL CHANGE MIGHT HELP.  THE OIL WAS CHANGED ON THE VEHICLE AND THEN THE CALLED SAYING THE VEHICLE WAS RUNNING VERY ROUGH WHEN THEY STARTED IT.  THEY ALSO THEN STATED THAT THERE WAS CONDENSATION IN THE RADIATOR FROM THE COOLANT. THEY ARE STILL WAITING FOR PARTS AND THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN THERE ALMOST THREE WEEKS.  TOTAL TIME IN THE SHOP WAS 5 WEEKS OUT OF 6 WEEKS.",

THE ENGINE LOSSES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT POWER DROPPING MY VEHICLES SPEED DOWN TO AROUND 30-40MPH PUTTING NOT ONLY MY FAMILY AND MYSELF IN DANGER BUT OTHER DRIVERS AS WELL.

I CALLED MUNDAY CHEVROLET IN HOUSTON TX TO BUY THE PART AND WAS TOLD I COULDN'T PURCHASE THE PART UNLESS THE DEALERSHIP INSTALLED IT?

MY WIFE'S 2010 GLK 350 MERCEDES WAS INCLUDED IN THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL, NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT WAS A NERVOUS TIME FOR US. WELL THANKS FOR LETTING ME EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE.

THEY SUGGESTED I REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD WITH AN OEM REPLACEMENT, WHICH I PLAN TO DO FOR SAFETY REASONS.  MY REASON FOR WRITING IS TO ASK IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT STANDARD FOR OPTICAL TRANSMISSION IS REQUIRED OF NON-OEM REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELDS.  IF I CAN SHOW THAT THE WINDSHIELD DOES NOT MEET FEDERAL GLASS STANDARDS PERHAPS THEY MIGHT HELP WITH THE ADDED COST OF REPLACEMENT.  I DO HAVE A GOOD TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING OF OPTICAL TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTANCE, AS I AM A RETIRED OPTOMETRIST.  I MIGHT ADD THAT PART OF THE HIGH REFLECTANCE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS IN PART DUE TO THE ASH-GRAY INTERIOR COLOR, A DESIGN FLAW.
