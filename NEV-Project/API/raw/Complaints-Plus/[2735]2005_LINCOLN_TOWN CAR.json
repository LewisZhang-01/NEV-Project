OUR ASSIGNMENT WAS TO PICK-UP CARS AND DRIVE THEM TO THE HERTZ OFFICE AT MCGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE. I FOUND MY CAR, A 2005 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL, BUCKLED UP, CHECKED THE MILEAGE, STARTED THE ENGINE AND TURNED THE LIGHTS ON. I PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND THE CAR ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY INTO TWO PARKED CARS.  ALL CARS HAD SEVERE DAMAGE.   I DON'T BELIEVE (AND AM WILLING TO TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST TO PROVE IT) I WAS IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCIDENT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR ALMOST A YEAR AS A BORDENTOWN, NJ HERTZ TRANSPORTER AND HAVE A PERFECT DRIVING RECORD, WITH NO VIOLATIONS OR WARNINGS OF ANY KIND.   SECONDLY, THE PARKING LOT ATTENDANT SAID HE THOUGHT I HAD MY BRAKES AND ACCELERATOR ENGAGED AT THE SAME TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WAS POSSIBLE UNLESS THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING BY ITSELF AND OVERPOWERED THE BRAKES.    THIRDLY, ACCELERATION MARKS ON THE PAVEMENT WERE CONTINUOUS, UNBROKEN AND HAD A UNIFORM CONSISTENCY IN COLOR AND WIDTH, SHOWING THAT NOTHING I DID HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE BACKWARD ACCELERATION.  FINALLY, I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN REPRODUCE THESE MARKS (APPROXIMATELY 33 FEET LONG) WITH THE SAME AUTOMOBILE UNLESS THEY SPEED THE ENGINE TO ITS MAXIMUM RPM IN NEUTRAL AND THEN SLAM THE TRANSMISSION  INTO REVERSE. I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT DO THIS.  SOMEBODY MUST INVESTIGATE THE MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS OF  THE 2005 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL THAT ROCKETED BACKWARD INTO TWO PARKED CARS.
