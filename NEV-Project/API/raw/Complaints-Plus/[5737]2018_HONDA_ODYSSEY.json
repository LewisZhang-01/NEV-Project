This has almost caused an accident with oncoming traffic when I am trying to turn left.   I beg of you to research this for a possible recall.

The car decelerated to almost 50 mph forcing me to move back to lane 4 in order to avoid being hit by an incoming 18-wheeler.  It's most likely an transmission issue of old with Honda. The vehicle regained power after I let go of gas pedal for about 4-5 seconds.   It happened again on I-40 near Flagstaff at high speed on my way home to Dallas from SoCal on Jan 2nd.

        "summary": "I have had 4 incidents where I was in heavy traffic and acceleration onto a busy freeway from a ramp and when I merged into heavy traffic, my car quit!  Suddenly I had no power and was slowing down rapidly.  The driver behind me got no warning brake lights and I had no place to go.  Needless to say I was greeted with a loud long horn blast and luckily not the expected crash sound I was expecting.  It took 3 to 5 seconds for my transmission to get back in gear and generate power.  At 70 miles an hour you travel quite a distance in 3 to 5 seconds.  The scariest incident was on a crowded four lane divided highway. I pulled out to pass a slow moving semi truck and as soon as I got into the faster crowded lane, the car lost power again.  This time I had a semi truck barreling down on me and and one to my right side. Fortunately, the truck was able to slow down and not hit me, but again the long  horn blast was accompanied by a rude gesture.  If any of these incidents had resulted in an accident I  probably would not have survived to even explain the cars malfunction.   This is totally unpredictable and not reproducible.  We took the car into a Honda dealership and reported the problem and were told they drove it and couldn't reproduce the problem and it was fine.   I strongly suspect there have been multiple incidents where people were not as fortunate as I was and the failure resulted in serious rear end collisions.   It would be interesting to see if Honda  vehicles with this year CVT have seen an increase in rear end collisions.   I hope I am not a victim of a fatal collision due to this defect, but I can't help but feel nervous any time I am merging into traffic or passing in heavy traffic. This problem has been reported before by others as a quick internet search confirms. It  would be a very expensive recall for Honda, but what price do you put on safety and a human life. Friends have suggested I get a different vehicle.  I can't afford this in today's economy.",

So for the past few years we had too manually lift the trunk and it's extremely heavy to lift and slow and can bang you in the head because it does not lift very high.  If this wasn't bad enough a month ago the electrical power/fuse to even accomplish what I just explained electrically shorted for no reasonable explanation.

The outside of the car electrical button has no electricity running in it at all.  This is terrible for a family of 5 children.  There haven't been any recalls on this and I'm sure it'll be quite expensive to replace.  Please look into this issue for us please.  Thank you kindly.

Honda's rain sensing function simply does not work, making the wipers go full speed in light mist or not work at all in heavy rain. Due to the fact the rain sensing function cannot be disabled, operators are either stuck with wipers off or on continual speed. This is both distracting as operators either must manually flick the wiper stalk for a one-wipe function in light rain every few seconds, or run the wipers continually, causing streaking and difficult visibility in lighter rain or snow events.   This problem is well-documented on Odyssey and Civic forums, and I have purchased and replaced the rain sensor with no change in system performance.

The transmission stopped working, no prior notifications, no weird noises it just stop working, I got to her and tried everything but I had to eventually tow it to the dealership. After a week of troubleshooting we were told a new transmission was needed, at 60K Miles! Thank god I opted for the extended warranty and only had to pay $800 of deductible, if not it would have been a $8K repair, it is unacceptable that a transmission stop working at 60K Miles!",

        "summary": "The transmission started shifting hard on November 20th, 2021 while driving 60-70 mph on the interstate.  I was on a Thanksgiving trip (Indianapolis, IN to Venice, FL) with my wife and three kids ages 8, 6, and 4.  We were on I-75 north of Atlanta when the transmission shifted hard up and down around 2000 rpm.  After about four hard shifts the van lost the ability to accelerate (no amount of throttle increased vehicle speed); no dash indicators or warnings.  At the time we were going around 60-70 mph when we lost acceleration and I had to coast the van to the side of the road through the northern Atlanta traffic.  The transmission did come back and I was able to get of the next exit and take the van to the Honda dealer.  The transmission continued to hard shift on the approximately 15 minute drive to the dealer.  I did leave the van with the dealer, but before I left I tried to put the van in reverse and it would not move.  The dash and button suggested I was in reverse but there was no function, and at that time I got a transmission problem warning.  Prior to trying to reverse the vehicle I did not get a warning.  So while on the interstate when it was a real problem the vehicle did not give any indication of what was wrong; so I\u2019m glad I was driving and not my wife or someone less capable in a dangerous driving situation. Honda looked at the van on Monday November 22nd and told me I needed a new transmission at a cost of $9,300.  The van was purchased in March of 2018 and currently has around 69k miles on it.  I don\u2019t believe anyone would agree that a transmission replacement at 69k miles is acceptable.   This transmission failure is on top of the RES problems that have persisted for multiple years now.  If Honda doesn\u2019t contribute financially to the transmission repair, I have no reason to buy another Honda.  My van has been nothing but problems.  The RES is unreliable for the family and the transmission failure left us stranded 500 miles from home.",

THEN IN SEPT OF 2019 THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED AFTER 3 SERVICE CALLS AND NUMEROUS FAX AND TELEPHONE CALLS BASICALLY HONDA CUSTOMER CARE SAID I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM.  THEN ONE DAY WHILE DRIVING THRU BUSY DOWNTOWN GRAND RAPIDS THE ODYSSEY DOWNSHIFTED ON ITS OWN WHILE THE WIFE AND MOTHER IN LAW WERE DRIVING.  MY WIFE ALMOST LOST CONTROL BUT WAS ABLE TO PULL OF THE ROAD.  AT THAT POINT I TRADED THE CAR IN.

THE ISSUE IS THAT TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IS RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE AND CAN NOT BE RECREATED OR DETECTED BY A COMPUTER CHECK.  BUT IT IS VERY REAL.

THE WORST PROBLEM IS WHEN TRAVELING ON A TWO-LANE HIGHWAY WITH SPEED LIMITS IN THE RANGE OF 45-55 MPH.  WHEN THE ROAD IS TURNING TO THE RIGHT, THE SENSOR WILL PICK UP ONCOMING TRAFFIC (BECAUSE IT SEES THE ONCOMING CAR AS IN MY LINE OF TRAVEL) AND PUT ON THE BRAKE.  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE, AND I ALMOST LOST CONTROL ON ONE OCCASION.  I HAVE SINCE LEARNED I CAN TURN THIS FEATURE OFF, BUT IT REACTIVATES EVERY TIME THE CAR IS RESTARTED.  THUS I HAVE TO REMEMBER ALWAYS TO TURN OFF THE FEATURE WHEN I RESTART THE CAR.  THIS IS ANNOYING, AND CAN STILL LEAD TO A PROBLEM IF I FORGET TO TURN IT OFF.    THE MOST FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE WAS ON/ABOUT AUGUST 7, 2019.  I WAS TRAVELING SOUTH ON U.S. 31 ABOUT 15 MILES SOUTH OF CHARLEVOIX, MI.

THE SUDDEN ACTION OF THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE FEATURE REALLY SURPRISED ME, AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE CAR.    THIS SO-CALLED SAFETY FEATURE IS MORE HELP THAN I NEED.

THE MESSAGE CLEARED ITSELF AFTER 20-30 MINUTES AND THE DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMS CAME BACK ONLINE.  WE DID NOT SEE ANY SUCH ERROR FOR THE REST OF OUR TRIP.    AT THE END OF OUR TRIP, ON 3 JAN 2019, WHEN MY FAMILY AND I WERE JUST OUTSIDE CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, THE VEHICLE PROCEEDED TO BRAKE QUITE AGGRESSIVELY WITHOUT DRIVER INPUT, AS IF IT WERE AVOIDING A COLLISION.  IT OCCURRED NEAR MILE MARKER 115 ON I-64 WESTBOUND, ON A DOWNWARD SLOPE AT DUSK ON DRY PAVEMENT.  WE WERE PERHAPS 1000-1200 FT FROM THE EXIT ITSELF, WELL BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE 'EXTRA LONG' SETTING ON THE ACC AT 70 MPH.  THE ONLY CARS IN FRONT OF US WERE ALREADY AT THE EXIT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE UNDERGOING ANY UNUSUAL MANEUVERS.  THIS OFF-RAMP IS PARTICULARLY LONG AT THIS EXIT SO I WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE VEHICLES JUST ENTERING THE RAMP WERE DECELERATING RAPIDLY.  I WAS USING ACC AND LKAS, AS I HAD DURING MOST OF OUR TRIP.    WHEN THE VAN WAS BRAKING, I INSTINCTIVELY DEPRESSED THE THROTTLE PEDAL TO TRY TO MAINTAIN SPEED.  THAT RESULTED IN THE ENGINE REVVING AND NO CHANGE TO THE HARD BRAKING.  I DISENGAGED THE ACC USING THE 'CANCEL' BUTTON AND THAT APPEARED TO END THE HARD BRAKING (I MAY HAVE BRIEFLY DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME BUT CANNOT BE SURE).  I WILL ALSO ESTIMATE THAT WE WENT FROM AROUND 70 MPH TO AROUND 30-40 MPH IN THOSE 2-3 SECONDS.    THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS EXTERNAL REASON FOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKING MANEUVER INSTIGATED BY THE HONDA'S ONBOARD SYSTEM.  THIS PRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL HAZARD.  WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THERE WERE NO VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY BEHIND US OR WE WOULD HAVE RUN A VERY HIGH RISK OF REAR COLLISION.  *JS",

I CALLED A LOCAL HONDA DEALER AND HE TOLD ME TO DRIVE IT AROUND FOR A WEEK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED; IE: IF THE MESSAGE WENT AWAY OR SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE CAR.  AFTER A WEEK I CALLED THE DEALER AGAIN AND HE TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR IN TO BE CHECKED.  THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR TO USE.  AFTER APPROXIMATELY 3-4 DAYS HE CALLED AND SAID THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF RODENT CHEWING ON THE COATING OF THE WIRES.  HE SAID THE CAUSE WAS WIRE HARNESS CHEWED CAUSING SHORT IN SHIELDED WIRE.  HE SAID HE NEEDED TO KEEP THE CAR ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS TO CHECK ALL THE WIRES.  HE CALLED ME BACK A COUPLE DAYS LATER AND SAID THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS AFFECTED AND NEEDED TO GET A NEW HARNESS.  APPARENTLY THE COATING ON THE WIRES WAS SOY BASED.  I DID SOME CHECKING AND THERE WERE SEVERAL LAW SUITS AGAINST SEVERAL AUTO MANUFACTURERS IN 2014 AND 2015 ABOUT THIS PROBLEM OF RODENTS EATING THE COATINGS ON THE WIRES.  I HAD TO WAIT 2 MONTHS BEFORE GETTING MY CAR BACK AS THE HARNESS WAS ON BACK ORDER.  THE TOTAL COST OF THIS WAS $2619.  I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET $500 AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY PAID THE REST.

THE HONDA REP, OLIVER (A HONDA EMPLOYEE), EXPLAINED TO MY HUSBAND THAT WHEN THE COMPUTER IN THE CAR CONNECTED TO THE COLLUSION AVOIDANCE SENSOR DISCONNECTS, A COMPUTER ASSUMES THE CAR IS OFF AND THAT FORCES THE CAR INTO PARK REGARDLESS OF THE SPEED IT IS GOING.  THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING, THE ENTERTAINMENT PANEL SCREEN WENT BLANK AND WHILE IT WAS REBOOTING, I LOST ALL CONTROL OF THE CAR, NO GAS, NO BRAKE, STEERING WAS DIFFICULT.  WHEN IT REBOOT, IT WAS IN PARK AND THE ENGINE MADE A TERRIBLE NOISE LIKE METAL HITTING METAL.  I WAS BARELY ABLE TO STEER THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHLY WITH MY THREE CHILDREN AGES 8 MONTHS, 2 YEARS AND 4 YEARS OLD IN THE CAR.      THE HONDA REP BELIEVES THE PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THE POWER CABLE IS CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY.  HE EXPLAIN THAT THIS CAUSED THE SENSORS TO DISCONNECT INTERMITTENTLY.  THE REP, OLIVER, BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON THE DEALERSHIP DURING THEIR REPAIR OF THE CAR FOR AN UNRELATED ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THIS IS INCORRECT.  THE CAR FRONT SENSOR HAVE BEEN LOSING CONNECTION TO THE COMPUTER SINCE WE TOOK IT HOME BEFORE THE DEALERSHIP TOUCHED THE BATTERY.    THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WITH THIS CAR'S ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT I WOULD NOT BRING UP, BUT OLIVER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE CAR COMPUTER SYSTEM MAKES IT RELEVANT.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CAR HAS 6 COMPUTER CONNECTED WITH ETHERNET CABLES.  MUCH OF THE WORK FOR THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE CAR AND TRANSMISSION IS DONE BY THE COMPUTER THAT ALSO RUNS THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM, THE BIG SCREEN COMMON IN THE FRONT PANEL OF CARS.  OLIVER EXPLAINED WHEN ONE COMPUTER GETS BOGGED DOWN, IT TAKES THE ENTIRE SYSTEM DOWN.  OUR CAR AND A LOT OF OTHER 2018 HONDA ODYSSEY HAVE A KNOWN FLAW THAT HONDA HAS NOT FIXED IN WELL OVER A YEAR.

THEY WERE MORE INTIMIDATED BY PRESENCE OF MY VEHICLE THAN HORN BLARING AT THEM.  SOUNDS STUPID, I KNOW, BUT IT EMPHASIZES PROBLEM.  HORN IS ALMOST ENTIRELY UNNOTICEABLE AND DOES NOT GET OR ATTRACT ATTENTION, WHICH MAKES IT A DEFINITE SAFETY CONCERN.  IT DOES NOT \"COMMAND\" YOUR ATTENTION AND IS NOT EASILY HEARD OVER AMBIENT NOISES.  HORN ON MY PREVIOUS 2013 ODYSSEY WAS A DUAL TONE HORN AND MUCH LOUDER AND DREW ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.  I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THE FACTORY INSTALLED HORN MEETS FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR DECIBEL LEVEL.  NOT THAT IT MATTERS BUT IT JUST SOUNDS PITIFUL COMING FROM AN ALMOST $50,000 FAIRLY LARGE VEHICLE.  HONDA HAS TRULY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS SAFETY ITEM AND I BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH OF A CONCERN TO REPLACE THIS LOUSY HORN WITH A MUCH LOUDER DUAL TONE HORN AT MY OWN EXPENSE.
