In November 2021, at 98, 000 miles, the car began having intermittent power steering loss.  The power steering might disappear for under a minute, or it might return for mere seconds.  There is no warning when the power steering goes out, so you have to assume that it is not going to respond with the electrohydraulic steering assistance feature operating.  As of today, it has been completely offline for 3 days (although it did come back on for about 5 seconds yesterday).   Without this feature operating properly, the car can be extremely difficult to steer.",

THE POP WAS THE ENTIRE WHEEL ASSEMBLY MOVING FORWARDS AND BACK BUMPING THE WHEEL WELLS AS THE CAR WENT FORWARD. NEEDLESS TO SAY I DIDN'T DRIVE FAR NOR DID I ACCELERATE FASTER THAN 10 MPH. I TOLD  THE PARENT OF THE DRIVER THAT THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE UNDER ANY CONDITION AND THAT IT NEEDED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.  THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHING RUBBER WAS COMPLETELY GONE.

I HAVE SEEN THE RUBBER WORN FROM THIS TYPE PART BUT THEY WERE NOT BEING USED AS A MOUNT. WHEN THE RUBBER ON THIS PART DETERIORATES IT CAUSES THE MOUNT TO BE UNSTABLE RESULTING IN THE WHOLE WHEEL ASSEMBLY MOVING LIKE A SWING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS WHILE DRIVING.  IN A TRAFFIC SITUATION THIS COULD BE DEVASTATING TO MORE THAN JUST THE DRIVER OF THIS CAR BUT ALSO TO THE CARS DRIVING NEAR IF THE WHEEL WERE TO COME OFF IN THEIR TRAFFIC.

WITHIN THE 10-15MINUTES I WAS INSIDE PURCHASING MOTHERS DAY FLOWERS, STOP AND SHOP EMPLOYEES HAD NOTICED A FIRE IN THE PARKING LOT.  I WALKED INTO THE PARKING LOT TO FIND THE POLICE AND FIRE FIGHTERS APPROACHING MY CAR.  WHEN I GOT TO IT THERE WAS NO MORE FIRE BUT STILL PLENTY OF SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND DRIVER SIDE WHEEL WELL.  I TOOK A LOOK UNDER THE CAR TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO MORE FIRE, SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LEFT.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO START THE CAR SO I JACKED UP THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE.  THE FIRE HAD ORIGINATED FROM THE ELECTRIC/HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING PUMP.  THE SOCKET ON THE PUMP WAS STILL SMOKING A LOT AND VERY MELTED.  THE PLUG CONNECTOR ON THE 12V/GROUNDING CABLES FEEDING THE PUMP WAS ALSO VERY MELTED.  SINCE THIS FIRE OCCURRED ON A 12V LINE IT ALSO SHORTED OUT THE BATTERY COMPLETELY.  I WAS ABLE TO JUMP THE CAR STARTED IN ORDER TO DRIVE IT ABOUT 15-16 MILES HOME.  SINCE THEN THE PUMP HAS BEEN DISASSEMBLED TO FIND THAT THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT BOARD WAS COMPROMISED (BURNED/ASHES). I DECIDED TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT AFTER I HAD RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY.   APPARENTLY THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  MOST SIMPLY FAIL, EITHER CAUSING ACCIDENTS OR MERELY MAKING IT EXTREMELY HARD DO DRIVE.  FEW OTHER UNLUCKY OWNERS HAVE THERE PUMPS BURST INTO FLAMES.  MINI IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE BUT OFFERS MINIMAL TO NO COMPENSATION.  IN CANADA A RECALL HAS ALREADY BEEN ISSUED FOR THESE DEFECTIVE PUMPS.

THE RADIATOR FAN AND THE POWER STEERING FAN DO NOT FUNCTION  UPON DOING RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURS EXTREMELY OFTEN IN 2002-2007 MINIS.  I ALSO FOUND, POSTED ON A MINI FORUM BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE AN ENGINEER, A DIAGNOSIS OF THE PROBLEM.  CARBON DUST FROM THE ELECTRIC MOTOR THAT OPERATES THE POWER STEERING PUMP GETS INTO THE CONTROL UNIT ATTACHED TO IT. SINCE THE CHIP WAS NOT PROPERLY SEALED WITH A LACQUER, IT CAUSEES A SHORT CIRCUIT IN THE CHIP. THIS CAUSES THE PUMP TO FAIL. ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS THE FAILURE OF THE COOLING FAN FOR THE POWER STEERING PUMP.  THE FAN CAN SEIZE, STOP COOLING THE PUMP, AND EVENTUALLY IT WILL OVERHEAT. THIS ALSO TRIPS A FUSE THAT STOPS THE RADIATOR FAN. AS A RESULT, THE ENGINE CAN ALSO OVERHEAT. I HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FAN HAS STOPPED WORKING.  SINCE I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR SINCE THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND THE HAS BEEN THE ONLY WARM DAY I HAVE DRIVEN IT, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED IT.

APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT THE BONNET OF THE CAR WAS OPENED AT A MILITARY ENTRANCE GATE VEHICLE INSPECTION AND NO SIGNS OF ANY ISSUES WERE NOTICED AT THAT TIME.

HOWEVER THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PUMP FAN STILL WOULD NOT SHUT OFF WHEN THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF, SO THIS ISSUE WAS STILL NOT RESOLVED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS REPAIR MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 60 MPH WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY JERKED AND SLOWED TO A STOP. LUCKILY MY DAUGHTER WAS IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE AND COULD PULL OVER ON TO THE SIDE OF THE BUSY FREEWAY.(STILL NO POWER STEERING WORKING)THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE MINI DEALER. THEY DIAGNOSED THAT THE CVT TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AT A COST OF $7150 APPROX. AND THIS IS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN DIAGNOSE THE STEERING FAN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. FROM ALL THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE ABOUT BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS, MINI NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY! WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AS THE REPAIRS ARE MUCH MORE THAN THE CARS VALUE AND THE MINI SERVICE MANAGER STATES THAT THE NEW CVT TRANSMISSION ONLY HAS A 2 YEAR WARRANTY. IF THIS IS A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION, WHY SHOULD WE PAY FOR ANOTHER ONE. AS OF TODAY MY DAUGHTER HAS TO WALK/BUS TO SCHOOL AND THE MINI SITS.WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE CLASS ACTION SUIT.  *TR",

I PARTICIPATE IN AN ENTHUSIAST FORUM WHERE THESE REPORTS ARE COMMON WHICH IS WHY I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP IMMEDIATELY, TO AVOID FURTHER IN-DRIVING FAILURE OR WORSE, A CAR FIRE.  THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE PAST AND IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT NEITHER NHTSA NOR MINI USA HAS RECALLED THESE VEHICLES FOR WHAT IS AN ALMOST GUARANTEED FAILURE WITH OBVIOUS AND POTENTIALLY GRAVE SAFETY RISKS. I AM PAYING $1200 FOR THE REPAIR WHICH IS EXPENSIVE BUT NOT OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE PAYING AND WORTH MY PERSONAL PIECE OF MIND SINCE MINI USA WILL NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM.  VEHICLE IS A 2003 MINI COOPER S WITH 87,000 MILES.  *TR",

RESEARCH INDICATES BMW IS AWARE OF THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY BMW OPTED TO NO LONGER USE THE CVT TRANSMISSION IN LATER MODELS. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION TO KEEP MINI OWNERS & OTHER DRIVERS SAFE. OURS IS JUST ONE OF MANY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WE'VE RECENTLY LEARNED OF WHILE RESEARCHING THE DISMAL TRACK RECORD OF BMW'S CVT TRANSMISSIONS IN EARLY MINI COOPERS. *TR",

I ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THE CAR HAD DIED TWO TIMES AND RAN ROUGH. MILEAGE 1,760.   7/2/03-I TOOK MINI IN COMPLAINING \"WHEN GOING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE CAR HAS A HARD LURCH\" AND BARON'S INVOICE STATES \"TEST DROVE CAR AND FOUND IT WAS VERY HARSH GOING INTO GEAR AND LURCHED WHEN IT WAS COLD\". 2ND AUTO TRANS CONCERN WAS \"CAR HAS ALMOST DIED AT LOW IDLES A FEW TIMES\". BARON REPROGRAMMED THE CAR UNDER WARRANTY. MILEAGE 6,465.   7/23/07-CUSTOMER GOODWILL PROVIDED BY BARON MINI AND REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AT NO COST ALTHOUGH WARRANTY WAS UP. MILEAGE 49,512.  9/11/07-I TOOK MINI IN AGAIN COMPLAINING OF ROUGH IDLE AND CAR WANTS TO DIE AT STOPS. MILEAGE 51,167.   8/13/09- MINI WAS HAVING A HARD TIME SHIFTING OUT OF 1ST GEAR. IT WOULD ONLY DRIVE 15-20 MPH AT UP TO 3,000 RPMS. I CALLED BARON AND WAS TOLD THE CURRENT TRANSMISSION HAD A TWO YEAR WARRANTY (WHICH MADE THIS COMPLAINT 2 YEARS AND A FEW WEEKS PAST WARRANTY) BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE MINI WOULD COVER REPAIR/REPLACEMENT. THEY DID NOT.  BARON FLUSHED AND FILLED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND SAID IT RUNS BETTER BUT IT IS NOT FIXED. THEY RECOMMEND REPLACING THE CVT AGAIN. I HAVE NOT HAD THE CVT REPLACED (FOR THE 2ND TIME).

INTERNET COMMUNITIES OF MINI OWNERS CONTAIN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF SUDDEN ENGINE BAY FIRES IN 2002 AND 2003 MINI COOPERS CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL SHORTS LINKED TO FAULTY POWER STEERING PUMPS OR FANS. FREQUENTLY THESE FIRES OCCUR AFTER THE CAR HAS BEEN SWITCHED OFF. THEY ALWAYS RESULT IN MODERATE VEHICLE DAMAGE AND MAJOR REPAIR COSTS (MINE IS ESTIMATED @ $1,600).  OCCASIONALLY THEY RESULT IN TOTAL VEHICLE LOSS AND / OR ADDITIONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE. HAD THIS FIRE OCCURRED IN MY HOME GARAGE AT NIGHT THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC; IF THIS KIND OF INCIDENT (SUDDEN POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURE + ELECTRIC FIRE) WERE TO OCCUR ON A FREEWAY AT SPEED IT COULD EASILY RESULT IN FATALITIES.

SHORTLY AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED, AND 10,481 MILES AFTER A DEALER MAINTENANCE CHECK, THE BRAKE LIGHT INDICATOR BEGAN FLASHING.   I TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEALER.  I WAS TOLD THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM NEEDED REPLACEMENT FOR $886.60. AT THE SAME SERVICE VISIT,  I WAS TOLD THE FRONT STRUTS NEEDED REPLACEMENT TO THE TUNE OF $1600.  MY MALE FRIENDS WHO ARE MECHANICALLY INCLINED AND/OR ENGINEERS SAID THAT ONE WOULD NEED TO BE DOING STUNTS IN A CAR TO NEED THAT KIND OF REPAIR AT 50,293 MILES.  IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHY THE INDICATOR ONLY TELLS WHEN BRAKES ARE TOTALLY SHOT,  OR WHY THE MOST RECENT SERVICE CHECK HAD NOT SHOWN WORN PADS AND DISKS.  LATER, AT 53,007 MILES, THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW FAILED AND THAT COST $497.51 TO REPLACE. AT 62,516 MILES THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM DIED WHICH COST $1173.58 TO REPLACE.  THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCK ON THE DRIVER?S SIDE DOES NOT WORK AND LORD KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT REPAIR WILL COST.  NOW AT 69K, THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPLACEMENT.  MY PRESENT MECHANIC (CHEAPER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DEALERSHIP) SAYS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION AND CLUTCH WITH A REMANUFACTURED SYSTEM WILL BE >$4000.  THIS IS AN OUTLANDISH AMOUNT OF REPAIR AND REPAIR COST FOR A $19,000 CAR WITH 70K MILEAGE.  I HAVE HAD 2 PREVIOUS HONDAS THAT WERE CHEAPER THAN THE MINI AND NEVER NEEDED A CLUTCH OR TRANSMISSION.  MY SON DROVE MY $14,000 '95 HONDA CIVIC UNTIL LAST MONTH AND IT HAD 200K MILES.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MINI, OR BMW FOR THAT MATTER, BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE.

WHEN THEY WERE DONE IT WAS DETERMINED THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE ESTIMATE WAS $7613.00 PLUS TAX. I DROVE HOME AND SPENT SOME TIME RESEARCHING THE CVT TRANSMISSION IN THE MINI COOPERS AND FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A HIGH FAILURE RATE. A LOOK AT SEVERAL FORUMS FOR MINI'S SHOWS POSTINGS OF PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO MINE IN COOPER MODELS WITH MILEAGES FROM 34,000 TO 113,000 ALL WITH CVT TRANSMISSIONS. THE REPLACEMENT COSTS WERE SIMILAR TOO. THERE WERE MANY COMMENTS FROM FORUM USERS TO AVOID BUYING A USED MINI COOPER WITH A CVT, \"AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE\" WAS ONE COMMENT. MINI NO LONGER USES THIS TRANSMISSION. MAYBE THE FAILURES MADE THEM LOOK TO ANOTHER SOURCE, I DO NOT KNOW. I ALSO CONTACTED A PERSON WHO IS GATHERING NAMES, 50 SO FAR, TO FILE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MINI TO TRY AND RECOUP THE MONEY SPENT REPAIRING A FAULTY TRANSMISSION. THAT IS JUST 50 PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW TO CONTACT HER TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST. AS OF RIGHT NOW THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT THEM. THERE MUST BE MORE, AND 50 TRANSMISSIONS IS ALOT OF MONEY. IF A INVESTIGATION IS DONE BY THE NHTSA AND A RECALL IS INITIATED THEN MAYBE THESE PEOPLE CAN BE REIMBURSED BY MINI. I FIND IT UNUSUAL THAT A TRANSMISSION SHOULD FAIL IN A VEHICLE WITH 81,500 MILES AND MOST COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ HAVE A AVERAGE FAILURE MILEAGE AT 60,000. MINIS WARRANTY EXPIRES AT 50,000 MILES. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE MINI DEALER HAS MADE A EFFORT TO SHARE THE EXPENSE WITH ME AND IN GOOD FAITH WILL REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FOR 1/2 PRICE. AS OF THIS WRITING I HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION YET.

I CONTACTED CORPORATE SERVICES WHO INFORMED ME THAT I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR A GOODWILL WARRANTY EXTENSION PROVIDED I TOOK TO THE VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION AT THE DEALER WHERE I LAST HAD IT SERVICED.  THE SERVICE DEALER, AND CORPORATE RELATIONS, WOULD NOT PROVIDE A GOODWILL EXTENSION BECAUSE THEY MAINTAINED THAT MY MECHANIC CAUSED THE STEERING PUMP TO FAIL.  THE DEALER OFFERED TO REPAIR THE PARTS FOR ABOUT $1900 FOR A NEW PUMP AND $140 FOR A NEW FAN.    AFTER SOME RESEARCH, INCLUDING INFORMATION THE DEALER TOLD MY MECHANIC, THIS FAILURE IS A REGULAR PROBLEM WITH THE EARLIER MINI MODELS AND THE DEALERS KEEP ADDITIONAL PARTS IN STOCK TO REPAIR VEHICLES AS THEY COME IN.  ADDITIONALLY, I READ THAT MINI SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THIS COMPONENT TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM BUT NEVER INFORMED PRIOR OWNERS OF THIS CHANGE.  MOREOVER, I ALSO READ THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH MINI DURING THE INITIAL 50,000 MILES OF OWNERSHIP, AND IN SOME CASES THE FAILURE OF THE PUMP FAN HAS CAUSED ENGINE FIRES WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN OPERATION.  *TR",

I GOT ON THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO SITES (SEE:    HTTP://WWW.CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/AUTOMOTIVE/MINI.HTML  HTTP://WWW.NORTHAMERICANMOTORING.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?S=015B1E186260B0639D13CF8A7D6522DD&T=73527&PAGE=8    WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES.  WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR A RECALL?  I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DEATHS, BUT SEVERAL REPORTS OF FIRES.  IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING 70 ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN THE POWER STEERING QUIT AND THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.  I SEE WHERE AN INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED IN APRIL (PE07022), BUT PLEASE MOVE ON THIS.  I AM VERY AFRAID THE NEXT PERSON WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY. *JB",

THE CRACK BEGAN UNDER THE TRIM, MOVED UP, TURNED A FEW INCHES UP, AND THEN SPREAD TOWARD THE PASSENGER SIDE. TWO WEEKS LATER, I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR IT'S FIRST SCHEDULED OIL SERVICE, WHERE I ASKED THE SERVICE ADVISOR, PETER WARK OF MINI OF THE MAIN LINE IN BALA CYNWYD, PA, ABOUT THE WINDSHIELD. HE PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE POINT OF A SMALL SCREWDRIVER AND RUN IT ALONG THE CRACK. ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH ABOVE THE TRIM, AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR A ROCK TO HIT, THE SCREWDRIVER CAUGHT A SMALL NICK IN THE GLASS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF SAND. HE INFORMED ME THAT THAT NICK WAS CAUSED BY A ROCK, WHICH CAUSED THE CRACK, WHICH WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. HE THEN TOLD ME ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS THEY USE OF GLUEING THE GLASS ON CAUSES THE ENTIRE BOTTOM FEW INCHES OF GLASS TO BECOME VERY WEAK, AND THAT ANYTHING HITTING THE GLASS IN THAT AREA, EVEN A TINY ROCK, WOULD CRACK THE GLASS. I FOUND THIS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE, SO I CALLED THE MINI CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AT 1-866-ASK-MINI. I SPOKE TO A \"MARTY\" WHO MERELY REPEATED OVER AND OVER THAT HE WAS \"SORRY THEY MADE THAT DETERMINATION, BUT A ROCK CHIP IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.\" AFTER RECEIVING NO HELP FROM THE COMPANY, I HAD THE DEALER REPLACE THE GLASS. I FEEL THAT THE REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE THE WAY THEY MANUFACTURE AND ATTACH THE GLASS CAUSES WEAKNESS, AND THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR SUPPLYING A CUSTOMER WITH A WARRANTY. I HAVE VIDEO AND PHOTOS OF THE CRACK AND NICK, AS WELL AS RECEIPTS FOR THE REPAIR. THE CRACK WAS FIRST NOTICED AND SPREAD AUGUST 12, 2004 AND MY SERVICE APPOINTMENT WAS AUGUST 24, 2004.*AK",
