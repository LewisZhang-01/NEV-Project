        "summary": "I\u2019m writing about a concerning experience I had with our 2014 Honda Odyssey EX-L vehicle. We\u2019ve had this vehicle for about 5 years and haven\u2019t had any issues until recently. On Monday, June 14th approximately at 5:30pm PDT we were starting to accelerate on the freeway onramp when our Honda vehicle stayed in a low gear. I was unable to accelerate and eventually the dashboard lights started to flash and the HondaLink system restarted while this was occurring. The instrument panel then displayed the words \u201cFailure\u201d and I proceed to the emergency shoulder of the freeway. Prior to this incident there were no indicators that there was an issue with the vehicle. After turning off the vehicle, I was no longer able to get the vehicle started and it had to be towed to our long-time auto repair shop. After they ran a diagnostic test and checked the vehicle, they said everything passed except for the battery which was still good prior to the incident. For safety, the battery was replaced and we drove the vehicle home on Tuesday, June 15th. The next day, June 16th, while my wife was running an errand and after returning to the car it turned over very \u201csluggishly\u201d, the HondaLink system restarted again, and then it began losing electrical power as well. My wife didn\u2019t want to take any chances with having the vehicle shut down again while driving and ended up having it towed again to our mechanic. The auto shop ran another diagnostic and thoroughly checked the vehicle and couldn\u2019t find anything wrong right away. They had to do some additional troubleshooting and found that the alternator was defective even though the Honda diagnostics didn\u2019t report any issues with the alternator. The alternator was replaced and we haven\u2019t experienced any additional issues to date. This incident is extremally concerning as the outcome could have been worse or tragic if this would have occurred while driving at a higher rate of speed on the road or freeway.

THEN I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND MY VAN WAS TAKEN TO MY HONDA SERVICE DEPT. ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, A SERVICE REP CALLED ME WITH THE DIAGNOSIS CODE P0303, WHICH HE SAID INDICATES THAT A MISFIRE WAS DETECTED IN THE #3 CYLINDER. THE REP SAID THAT THIS ISSUE ALLOWED OIL TO PASS BY THE MULTIPLE OIL RINGS ON THE PISTON INTO THE CHAMBER AND FOULED THE SPARK PLUG. HE TOLD ME THAT THIS ISSUE WAS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. THE SERVICE REP QUOTED $4,420.00 TO REPAIR OBDII CODE P0303. I ASKED HIM IF THE MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. THE SERVICE REP SAID THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT A RESULT OF ANY DRIVER ACTION OR LACK OF MAINTENANCE.

THE STANDARD SEEMS TO ALLOW CAR MANUFACTURERS TO UTILIZE SEAT BELT BUCKLE ASSEMBLIES ANYWHERE IN THE 0 TO 175MM RANGE FROM THE BIGHT.  A BIGHT-TO-BUCKLE (B2B) DISTANCE OF 175MM MAKES IT DIFFICULT (OR IMPOSSIBLE) TO PROPERLY SECURE CHILD CAR SEATS, USING THE VEHICLE'S SEAT BELT, IF THE CHILD SEAT DEPTH IS SHALLOWER THAN 175MM.  THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS DEVELOPED AFTER I WAS UNABLE TO PROPERLY SECURE A DIONO RADIAN RXT CAR SEAT (FORWARD FACING MODE) IN MY 2014 HONDA ODYSSEY.  THE BUCKLES IN THE HONDA (SEE ATTACHED) APPEAR TO BE CLOSE TO THE 175MM THRESHOLD.  HOWEVER, I WAS ABLE TO SECURE THE SAME DIONO SEAT IN MY 2007 AUDI A6 BECAUSE THE AUDI'S BUCKLES ARE FLUSH MOUNTED IN THE SEAT CUSHION (I.E. B2B OF ~0MM).      I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS A \"HONDA\" PROBLEM, BUT A PROBLEM WITH THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY OF FMVSS-213 WRT HOW CHILD SEATS ARE TO BE TESTED.  FMVSS 213 S6.1.2 SIMPLY STATES THAT THE \"STANDARD SEAT ASSEMBLY\" IS TO BE USED, AND MAKES NO MENTION OF ENSURING COMPATIBILITY  OF FIT THROUGHOUT THE B2B RANGE.  THE DIONO MANUAL (SEE PG-19, ATTACHED) INDICATES THAT THEIR SEATS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH \"...ANCHOR POINTS FORWARD OF THE SEAT CREASE.\"  I REVIEWED OTHER CHILD CAR SEAT MANUFACTURER INSTRUCTION MANUALS AND FOUND SIMILAR WARNINGS.  WHILE THE HONDA SEAT BELTS CONTAIN FMVSS-209 CERTIFICATION TAGS, AND THE DIONO IS LABELED WITH FMVSS-213 TAGS, I BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO STANDARDS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE.      RECOMMENDATIONS:  (1)UPDATE \"STANDARD SEAT ASSEMBLY\" OF FMVSS-213 SUCH THAT B2B IS EXPLICITLY FIXED AT 175MM     OR    (2) FMVSS-209 MUST RESTRICT B2B< 25MM.

THE SHORT-TERM FIX IS TO DRAIN AND FILL THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WHILE A FUTURE FIX IS A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT IS NOT YET COMPLETED.    ISSUE 2: WHEN BRAKING THERE IS VIOLENT VIBRATIONS IN THE STEERING WHEEL.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, DON'T REMEMBER THE DATE BUT WHILE STILL UNDER THE 3 YEAR/36000 MILE WARRANTY, THEY TURNED THE ROTORS WHICH CAUSED THE VIBRATIONS TO GO AWAY.  NOW AT 55000 MILES THE VAN IS AGAIN HAVING VIOLENT VIBRATIONS WHILE BRAKING.  THE ROTORS SHOULD NOT WARP SO FAST, WITH LOW MILEAGE.",

WHEN THE BELT WAS RELEASED, WE COULD NOT MOVE THE PASSENGER FORWARD DUE TO THE SAFETY FEATURE, AND WE COULD NOT MOVE THE POWER CHAIR BACKWARD DUE TO THE BELT ENTANGLED IN THE ARM OF THE POWER MOBILITY CHAIR.  WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE BELT COME FURTHER OUT IN ORDER TO DETANGLE IT, HOWEVER, THE SAFETY FEATURE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT, AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO OVER-RIDE EMERGENCY RELEASE BUTTON FOR THE SAFETY FEATURE ONCE IT IS ENGAGED.  THE PASSENGER WAS TRAPPED IN THE POWER MOBILITY CHAIR IN THE MINIVAN. WE WERE ALONE, OVER 60 MILES FROM HOME, AND STRANDED IN A PARKING LOT.

THE NAVIGATION/RADIO SCREENS COMPLETELY BLACK OUT, ONLY SHOWING YELLOW LINES THAT YOU NORMALLY SEE WHEN BACKING UP. DURING THIS TIME, THE COLLISION DETECTION SYSTEM, BACKUP CAMERA, RADIO AND HEATING CONTROLS ALL DO NOT WORK.THE SCREENS STAY BLACKED OUT EVEN DURING DRIVING/BACKING UP, THEN ONCE THE VEHICLE IS OFF AND RESTARTED,THINGS GO BACK TO NORMAL. THIS HAS HAPPENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS RANDOMLY, AND VARY IN HOW LONG IT MALFUNCTIONS FOR. I WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME PICTURES AND CAPTURED VIDEO TO SHOW IT MALFUNCTIONING. HONDA DEALER INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS USER ERROR. THEY THOUGHT THAT I HAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNED ON THE LANE WATCH CAMERA, BUT ONCE I SHOWED THEM THE VIDEO, THE MECHANIC STATED TO ME THAT HONDA WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FROM IT HAPPENING TO OTHER VEHICLES. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER, I QUESTION WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY REPLACED THE PART. ALL OF OUR ORIGINAL SETTINGS WERE STILL PROGRAMMED INCLUDING VOICE DIALING. FURTHER RESEARCH LED US TO FIND OUT THAT THE SYSTEM HAD THE VIN # STORED IN ITS INTERNAL MEMORY, WHICH PROVES THAT ITS THE ORIGINAL PART FROM WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED. I ALSO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY SUED BY THE STATE OF NJ FOR CONSUMER FRAUD. I HAVE HAD TO AUDIO RECORD CONVERSATIONS AND TAKE PICTURES AS PROOF OF THE PROBLEMS MY VEHICLE HAS BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT TO SAY IS NO CODE, NO PROBLEM, WE CAN'T DUPLICATE OR ITS NORMAL.  *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION JERKS/BUCKS HORRIBLY ESPECIALLY IN LOWER GEARS, WHILE STOPPING/BREAKING, WHILE ACCELERATING, AND ALSO DURING TURNS. IT JOLTS FORWARD AT TIMES UNCONTROLLABLY. ALSO, IT DOESN'T SHIFT CORRECTLY INTO GEARS, WHICH CAUSES RPMS TO GET ABOVE 3000 JUST DURING REGULAR DRIVING. ALSO HAS PROBLEMS WITH DOWNSHIFTING PROPERLY. THE FRONT ROTORS AND BREAKS HAVE ALREADY HAD TO BE REPLACED AT ONLY 12,800 MILES. IMO, I BELIEVE THEY WARPED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT DOWNSHIFT PROPERLY, (THIS CAUSED EXTRA STRAIN ON THEM WITH THE LACK OF ASSIST FROM THE TRANSMISSION).  THE TRANSMISSION ALSO LAGS DURING ACCELERATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO PASS SOMEONE ON THE HIGHWAY, EVEN THE SLIGHTEST PRESSING OF THE BREAKS BEFORE CHANGING LANES CAUSES MAJOR LAG WITH TRYING TO REGAIN SPEED, THEN THE VEHICLE YOU ORIGINALLY TRIED TO PASS IS NOW FURTHER AHEAD OF YOU, SO OVERALL IT IS HORRIBLE WITH PASSING SPEED/ACCELERATION.      BROUGHT INTO DEALER AND THEY CLAIM NOTHING IS WRONG. THEIR FAMOUS LINES ARE \"NO CODE NO PROBLEM\", \"WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM\", OR THEY SAY \"ITS NORMAL\".

THE MECHANIC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM, HOWEVER THE SERVICE DIRECTOR STILL INSISTED IT WAS DRIVING NORMAL. THANKFULLY, I AUDIO-RECORDED THE TEST DRIVE SO I DO HAVE PHYSICAL PROOF THAT THE MECHANIC ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS HAVING PROBLEMS DURING THE TEST DRIVE.

HE WAS SITTING IN HIS TODDLER CARSEAT, PER GUIDELINES. IN TRYING TO UNBUCKLE HIMSELF, HE BECAME INEXTRICABLY ENTANGLED IN THE SEATBELT. THE MORE HE OR I TRIED TO FREE HIM; THE TIGHTER THE SEATBELT BECAME AROUND HIS TORSO, EVEN MAKING INDENTATIONS AND ABRASIVE RED MARKS ON HIS SKIN. SINCE I COULD FIND NO WAY TO RELEASE THE TENSION IN THE SEATBELT AND SINCE IT ONLY BECAME TIGHTER BECAUSE OF MY EFFORTS TO FREE HIM, I DECIDED TO SEVER THE SEATBELT, EFFECTIVELY RESOLVING THE TENSION AND ALLOWING HIM TO GET OUT OF THE SEAT. THE INCIDENT LASTED APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES FROM THE REALIZATION THAT HE WAS ENTANGLED TO THE DECISION TO CUT HIM OUT OF THE SEATBELT. I COULD NOT LIFT HIM OUT OF THE SEATBELT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO TIGHT, AND HE COULDN'T WIGGLE HIS WAY DOWN THE SEAT TO FREE HIMSELF WITHOUT THE BELT WRAPPING AROUND HIS NECK. GIVEN THE SITUATION, SEVERING THE SEATBELT WAS THE BEST AND SAFEST CHOICE TO FREE HIM. THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO RELEASE THE TENSION OF THE SEAT BELTS IN THE THIRD ROW OF HONDA ODYSSEY MODELS, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILY VEHICLES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN. I HAVE REGISTERED THIS CONCERN WITH HONDA, AND IT HAS BEEN A CASE NUMBER.   *TR",

I HAVE CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE AND THEY REALLY DON'T CARE MUCH. THEY TELL ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SEATBELT AND IT'S WORKING THE WAY IT IS. I ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT MY CASE WOULD BE CLOSED. THEY ARE RUDE AND NO SYMPATHY TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
