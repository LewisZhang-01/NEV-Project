I REQUESTED THAT THEY PERFORM THE 100,000-MILE SERVICE AND TO THOROUGHLY CHECK THE CAR FOR ANY REPAIRS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED SINCE IT WOULD SOON BE OUT-OF-WARRANTY.    FIVE WEEKS AND 3000 MILES LATER (AND OUT OF WARRANTY) I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS MY ABS AND BRAKE WARNING LIGHTS TURNED ON AND THREE BEEPS SOUNDED (THE FIRST INSTANCE OCCURRED AT 103,085 MILES).  BOTH TIMES THE WARNING LIGHTS WENT OFF WITHIN SECONDS.  UPON RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS RELATED TO A FAILED ABS CONTROL MODULE, APPARENTLY A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT SHOULD HAVE A RECALL ASSOCIATED WITH IT SINCE IT FAILS PREMATURELY.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, IT WILL COST BETWEEN $1800 AND $2400 FOR THEM TO REPAIR THE ABS CONTROL MODULE.  THIS IS THE SECOND LARGE ITEM FAILURE WITHIN FIVE WEEKS AND 3000 MILES OF MY WARRANTY EXPIRATION (THE FIRST WAS A FAILED TIMING BELT AND TENSIONER).  IT APPEARS TO ME THAT VOLKSWAGEN HAS INSTITUTED PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE INTO THEIR PRODUCTS!  I AM ALSO VERY UPSET THAT BOTH OF THESE FAILURES ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AND SHOULD BE KNOWN BY BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND VOLKSWAGEN AND COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT.  *JB",

THESE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF THE EBD IS INOPERATIVE, THE PROPORTION OF HYDRAULIC FORCE APPLIED TO THE REAR BRAKES DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING IS AS GREAT AS IT IS DURING MODERATE BRAKING EFFORT WHEN THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFER OF VEHICLE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT WHEELS.

IF THIS MODULE SHOULD FAIL DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING ON DRY PAVEMENT, THE REAR WHEELS COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD EASILY INCLUDE FATALITIES.

THIS EXPENSIVE ($1300) CIRCUIT BOARD IS LOCATED UNDER THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. IT IS IN A NON-DRAINING WELL IN THE FLOOR PAN UNDER THE CARPETING AND PADDING. IT IS IN NO WAY SEALED OR WATERPROOFED TO PREVENT CORROSION FROM CONDENSATION OR FAILURE FROM WATER BUILDUP IN THE AREA. NORMAL USE IN INCLEMENT WEATHER ALLOWS DROPS OF WATER TO ACCUMULATE IN THIS AREA . ONCE THE WATER GETS TO THE AREA WHERE THE TCU IS LOCATED IT REMAINS THERE. WHATEVER EVAPORATION THAT DOES OCCUR JUST INCREASES THE HUMIDITY AROUND THE TCU, IT THEN CONDENSES ON THE COLD METAL FLOOR PAN OR THE TCU AND DRAINS BACK INTO THE WELL THE TCU IS IN. SINCE IT IS UNDER THE CARPET AND THE PADDING ONE CANNOT SEE OR EASILY DETECT THAT WATER OR EVEN JUST A DAMPNESS EXISTS HERE. THE TCU CORRODES UNTIL IT FAILS, WHEN IT FAILS THE VEHICLE IS UNDRIVEABLE AND MUST THEN BE TOWED TO A VW DEALER. THERE IS NO DIAGNOSTIC DATA AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ALLOW A REGULAR GARAGE TO REPAIR IT. EVEN GC VOLKSWAGEN REQUESTED 3 HRS OF DIAGNOSTIC TIME. THEIR FINAL CHARGE WAS 3.5 HRS TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND REPLACE THE TCU. A 12 MONTH/12000 MILE WARRANTY WAS GIVEN EXCEPT FOR FAILURE DUE TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS MEANS ANY USE OF THE VEHICLE OUTSIDE OF A TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY CONTROLLED ENCLOSURE. I WAS ASSURED THAT IT WILL FAIL AGAIN AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO PREVENT IT. BY THE TIME ONE DISCOVERS WATER IN THE AREA THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.  VW WILL NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPAIRS OR ISSUE A SOLUTION TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE TCU. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AS IT EFFECTS EVERY 1.8T W/ TIPTRONIC AUTO TRANSMISSION. VW IS ENDANGERING PEOPLES LIVES AND COSTING PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS DUE TO THE POOR PLACEMENT OF THIS COMPONENT. OUTSIDE INFLUENCE IS A SCAM TO DENY PAYMENT.

MANY AUDI AND VW MODELS MANUFACTURED STARTING IN THE LATER '90S AND CONTINUING TO PRESENT (INCLUDING MINE), USE THE BOSCH 5.3 ABS CONTROLLER, WHICH IS PRONE TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURE, OSTENSIBLY DUE TO DEFECTIVE DESIGN.  THIS MODULE CONTROLS MULTIPLE BRAKE-RELATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THE ABS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR WINTER DRIVING, BUT THE MOST CRITICAL FUNCTION OF THIS MODULE IS PROBABLY THE ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION, OR EBD.  THESE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF THE EBD IS INOPERATIVE, THE PROPORTION OF HYDRAULIC FORCE APPLIED TO THE REAR BRAKES DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING IS AS GREAT AS IT IS DURING MODERATE BRAKING EFFORT WHEN THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFER OF VEHICLE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT WHEELS.  THE EBD IS SUPPOSED TO ADJUST THE FRONT/REAR BRAKING DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICALLY ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF THE DECELERATION, SO THAT THE REAR WHEELS WILL NOT LOCK UP DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING.  IF THIS MODULE SHOULD FAIL DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING ON DRY PAVEMENT, THE REAR WHEELS COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD EASILY INCLUDE FATALITIES.  THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR OWNERS, COSTING ROUGHLY $2000, AND MANY OWNERS HAVE PROBABLY PUT OFF THE REPAIR INDEFINITELY.  THE VW COMPANY HAS PROVIDED ABSOLUTELY NO ASSISTANCE IN HELPING OWNERS DESPITE KNOWING OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE TYPES OF FAILURES AS EARLY AS 30K MILES.  SERVICES THAT CHARGE ~$300.00 TO REBUILD THE FAILED ABS MODULE ARE UNRELIABLE AND CAUSE DRIVERS TO WORK ON THEIR CARS WITH NO MECHANICAL SENSE BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION.  EVIDENCE WHICH CAN BE FOUND THROUGH A SIMPLE WEB SEARCH, SUGGESTS THAT THE PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD, AND THAT IF IT HAS NOT ALREADY LED TO SERIOUS ACCIDENTS, IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME.

I DRIVE 70 MILES A DAY, MOSTLY FREEWAY, WHICH AS ALL KNOW IS ACTUALLY VERY EASY ON AN AUTOMOBILE. YET WITH-IN 2 YEARS (40K) MY FRONT SUSPENSION WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF PREMATURE WEAR. I GET MANY \"CREAKS\" AND \"CLUNKS\"  THAT ARE EASY TO HEAR AT LOW SPEEDS. AFTER RESEARCHING IN POPULAR INTERNET FORUMS FOR THE CAR,(WWW.CLUBB5.COM , WWW.VWVORTEX.COM) I FOUND OUT THIS FAILURE IS VERY COMMON FOR THIS AUTOMOBILE.    VMOA (VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA) HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL YET (EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS) AS OF THIS LATE DATE. (6/04) THE RESPONSE FROM VWOA AND YOUR DEALER NETWORK HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT, TO SAY THE LEAST.  SOME DEALERS WILL NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE CAR, SOME WILL LOOK AT IT AND SAY NOTHING IS WRONG, AND SOME WILL SAY THAT IT IS THE CONTROL ARMS, BUT WILL NOT HELP OUT THE OWNER WHEN THE TIME COMES TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER CARE CENTER AT VWOA . VWOA IS NOT MUCH MORE HELP, PROMISING TO GET ON THE PROBLEM AND TELLING YOU THEY WILL CALLBACK, ONLY THEY DON\u0019T. OR IF THEY DO ,IT IS, \u001cSORRY WE CANNOT HELP YOU.\u001d.    SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MANY OF THE OWNERS THAT ARE OUT OF WARRANTY, MUST PAY FOR A COSTLY REPAIR OUT OF POCKET. A REPAIR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. (I HAVE NEVER HAD CONTROL ARM BUSHING FAILURE IN MY PREVIOUS 13 AUTOMOBILES!)    REPAIR COSTS RUN OVER $700 FOR PARTS, AND THE SAME AMOUNT IN LABOR.     I AM PURCHASING MY CAR FROM THE BANK SOON. OVERALL IT IS A GREAT CAR. I MUST REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS VERY SOON. I DONT LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AND THE HIGH COST IT WILL RUN ME.

VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NOT ISSUED A RECALL YET.  SO I TOLD THE TECHNICIAN TO CHECK FOR ME AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL ISSUED TO THE FRON SUSPENSION. HE SAID NO AND HE MENTIONED THAT TO FIX THE SUSPENSION PROBLEM I WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THE SUSPENSION STEERING LINKAGES AND OTHER COMPONENTS. HE GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE FOR THE FIX AT AROUND $1200.00 DOLLARS.  2 WEEKENDS AGO I WENTO TO A VOLKSWAGEN SWAP MEET AND FOUND OUT THAT A FEW OTHER PASSAT DRIVERS WERE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR SUSPENSIONS.

BUT, THAT FOR NO EXPLAINABLE REASON MY VIN WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED VW AND THEY CONCURRED BUT COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT ONLY UNETHICAL, BUT VW IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH CARS THAT THEY KNOW HAVE A SERIOUS DEFECT. NOT ONLY DIDN'T VW COVER ALL THE APPLICABLE VINS IN THEIR RECALL, BUT THEY DID NOT INFORM THEIR CONSUMERS OFTHE POTENTIAL PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THIS PROBLEM, IF LEFT UNCORRECTED, COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM IF THE CONTROL ARMS FAILED AT HIGH SPEED. VW WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED ONCE AGAIN, THAT THIS DEFECT IN THE CONTROL ARMS OCCURED AT ONLY 48,000 MILES. NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO PAY $1200 FOR A SERIOUS, AND ACKNOWLEDGED, DESIGN DEFECT, BUT THE REPAIR PARTS THAT WERE INSTALLED ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE POORLY DESIGNED ONES. THIS PROBLEM WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR EVEN KILLED. VW REFUSES TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT.

I WAS ABOUT 140 MILES AWAY FROM HOME AND THE COST, AFTER THE ROADSIDE INSURANCE PAID ITS PART, WAS $400.     AS IT TURNS OUT, THE PRESSURE PLATE OF THE CLUTCH BROKE INTO 3 PIECES.

ON 2/18/03 I INFORMED THE MANUFACTURER THAT I EXPECTED THEM TO CONFIRM REIMBURSING ME FULLY FOR THE $400 TOWING COST AND TO BEAR AT LEAST HALF OF THE COST OF $912 FOR REPLACING THE CLUTCH,  $456. I ALSO OFFERED TO SEND COPIES OF THE RECEIPTS. THE BROKEN PARTS CAN ALSO BE INSPECTED IF YOU WHISH AT MY RESIDENCE OR AT A CONVENIENTLY LOCATED PLACE OF YOUR CHOICE.    SINCE I DID NOT HEAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER SINCE THEY ACKNOWLEDGED ON 2/19/03 RECEIPT OF MY EMAIL AND PROMISED ACTION WITHIN 48 HRS., THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

THE MAIN PROBLEM HAPPENING IS BASICALLY I HEARD CONSISTENT CLUNKING NOISE WHEN TURNING UNDER LOW SPEED, GOING OVER A BUMP, AND OCCASIONAL BRAKING. ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE HEARD, THIS IS CALLED THE \"LOWER CONTROL ARM FAILURE\" AND THERE'S A BULLETIN IN VW THAT THIS IS RECOGNIZED AS A PROBLEM AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE INFOMED TO INSTALL PARTICULAR COMPONENTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I THINK THIS IS QUITE A CRITICAL PART FOR THE CAR AS WE DON'T WANT THE CAR TO LOSE CONTROL EXPECIALLY TURNING. AND THE MOST THING THAT PISSED ME OFF IS THAT VWOA REFUSED TO COVER SOME COSTS! I KNOW AT LEAST AN OWNER GOT IT ALL COVERED BY CONTACTING VWOA! THE FIRST NOTICING OF THE NOISE WAS AT AROUND 40000 MILES BUT SUNNYVALE VW REFERRED THAT THIS IS A NOISE COMING OUT FROM THE ENGINE PUMP WHICH IS LEAKING AT THAT TIME. NOISE OF COURSE DIDN'T RESOLVE AND I DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO ASK AS THEY CAN'T DETECT IT. HOPEFULLY, I CAN GET SOME HELP FROM NHTSA. THANKS",
