THEN ON 11/10/08 I WENT IN TO HAVE MY VEHICLE INSPECTED AND WAS ADVISED THAT IT FAILED, THE ROCKER PANELS WERE ROTTED OUT! I MADE AN APPT FOR 11/19/08 TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO FIX THIS & LEARNED THAT THE ROCKER PANELS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FROM FORD & THAT I NEEDED TO FABRICATE NEW ONES! MY CAR, WHICH HAD 142,555 MILES ON IT, WHICH I THOUGHT TO BE IN PERFECT CONDITION, DID NOT PASS INSPECTION BECAUSE OF SUB-FRAME ROT!

IN SEARCHING FOR ESTIMATES TO REPAIR THIS DAMAGE I LEARNED THAT ALL TAURUS' RUSTED IN THE SAME PLACE! UNDER THE ROCKER PANEL COVERS, RIGHT WHERE MINE WAS ROTTED. I WAS TOLD BY EVERY COMPANY TO JUNK MY CAR! I CALLED FORD TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS AND WAS ONLY TOLD \"YOUR CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY\".

REPAIR SHOP TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL ON SOMETHING SIMILAR, CONTACTED LOCAL FORD DEALER WHO SAID THE RECALL ONLY COVERED 1999 - 2001 ONES.  HAD BOTH FRONT SPRINGS AND TIRE REPLACED, ALONG WITH AN ALIGNMENT.  AFTER RETURNING HOME, I CHECKED OUT THE DETAILS OF THE RECALL ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE.  INTERESTING TO SEE THAT I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WITH A 98 THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS WAS COVERED UNDER THE RECALL PROGRAM.  CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE DIRECTLY, THEY TOLD ME THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD DO SINCE MY CAR WAS NOT IN THE RECALL.  CONTACTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER, WHO SAID HE WOULD TALK TO THE DISTRICT SERVICE REP TO SEE IF FORD WOULD COVER MY REPAIR COSTS.  REP SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIRS.  DEALER RECOMMENDED THAT I HANG ONTO MY PAPERWORK IN CASE THE RECALL WAS EXPANDED IN THE FUTURE.  *JB",

THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE DROPPED DOWN SO THAT THE FRONT TIRE WAS RUBBING ON THE BODY OF THE CAR (GENERATING TIRE SMOKE).  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IF I DROVE THE CAR ANY FARTHER EVEN MORE DAMAGE WOULD OCCUR.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS BREAKDOWN OCCURRED IN A LOCAL PRISON AREA WHERE POSTED SIGNS WARN PEOPLE NOT TO PICK UP HITCH HIKERS.  THIS MADE IT CHALLENGING FOR ME TO FIND SOMEONE WHO WOULD LET ME USE THEIR PHONE TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL GARAGE TO GET IT BACK ROADWORTHY.  TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, I HAD TO PURCHASE 2 NEW COIL SPRINGS, 2 NEW FRONT STRUTS, A NEW STRUT MOUNT, 2 NEW FRONT SWAY BAR LINKS, AND A FRONT END ALIGNMENT.  IT THEN TOOK ME A FEW DAYS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING ON ANY ROAD SURFACE THAT HAD BUMPS ON IT.  IN JULY I BECAME AWARE OF THE RECALL ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH 1999-2001 TAURUS AND SABLE SEDANS FOR COIL SPRING BREAKAGE.  I CONTACTED FORD AND WAS INFORMED THAT THIS RECALL DID NOT APPLY TO 1998 MODELS.  IT APPEARS THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH 1998 VEHICLES ALSO.  HOPEFULLY, MORE PEOPLE WILL UTILIZE THIS SITE TO DOCUMENT ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS TO RE-OPEN AN INVESTIGATION. *AK",

I THOUGHT I HAD A \"BLOW-OUT\"  THOUGHT IT WAS ODD BECAUSE HAD A NEW SET OF TIRES WITH LESS THAN 400 MILES ON THEM.  ASKED SON TO PUT THE DONUT ON SO I COULD TAKE THE TIRE TO GOODYEAR FOR REPLACEMENT.  WAS THE LEFT FRONT TIRE INSIDE PART OF TIRE LOOKED AS IF SOMEONE HAD TAKEN A KNIFE AND CUT THE TIRE.  UPON RETURNING FROM THE TIRE DEALER MY SON POINTED OUT THE BROKEN COIL SPRING ON THE LEFT FRONT (DRIVERS) SIDE.  HAD CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL GARAGE FOR REPAIR.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER AND THE MECHANIC AT THE GARAGE STATED THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A COIL SPRING FRACTURE.  LET ALONE ONE FRACTURE IN THREE PLACE THE WAY THE COIL SPRING DID ON THIS VEHICLE.  PAID TO HAVE BOTH FRONT SPRINGS SHOCKS AND STRUTS REPLACED. HEARD ABOUT RECALL FOR TAURUS AND SABLE 899,000 ON RADIO STATION.  SO I STOPPED BY LOCAL FORD, HUDSON IN MADISONVILLE KY, THEY COULD FIND NO INFORMATION ABOUT A RECALL INVOLVING MY VIN.  WAS GIVEN FORD CUSTOMER RELATION 800 NUMBER.  CALLED AND WAS ESSENTIALLY TOLD THAT IT WAS MY PROBLEM THAT MY VIN WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE RECALL. ASKED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR, SHE RETURNED MY CALL SOMEWHAT TIMELY, BUT REITERATED THAT MY VECHICLE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE RECALL, AND IT WAS MY PROBLEM.  IN THE MEAN TIME I VISITED YOUR SITE AND FOUND FOUR COMPLAINTS WITH 1998 TAURUS'S WITH ALMOST IDENTICAL COIL SPRING FRACTURES.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE RECALL NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED AND/OR THE INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE REOPENED.  THE FORD CUSTOMER RELATION PERSON SAID THEIR ENGINEERS HAD NOT DETERMINED THERE IS A PROBLEM.

THIS IS WHERE I HAD ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE CAR AND THE PLACE THAT HAD REPLACED THE ENGINE THE PREVIOUS SUMMER.  AFTER WAITING NEARING TWO WEEKS TO GET PERMISSION FROM DETROIT (?) TO FIX IT, AN INSPECTOR WAS SENT DOWN TO EXAMINE THE DAMAGE.  HIS REPORT INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FROM A DEFECTIVE ENGINE, BUT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. THEY VOIDED THE WARRANTY.  I ASKED WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION MEANT.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE INSPECTOR HAD DECIDED THAT MY CAR HAD BEEN IN A FLOOD.  I WAS TAKEN BACK.  MY CAR HAD NOT BEEN IN A FLOOD.

APPARENTLY FORD DID A \" CUSTOMER SATISFACTION\" RECALL WHICH EXPIRED IN 99 BUT WAS NEVER DONE ON MY CAR (I BOUGHT IT USED IN 2000).

AAMCO HAD TO TOW IT AWAY BECAUSE, AT BEST, IT LURCHED FORWARD OR BACKWARD A FEW FEET. AAMCO REPLACED TURBO UNIT FOR 1400.00 THEY REPLACED BULB INTERIOR. WITHIN A WEEK THE OLD PROBLEM STARTED AGAIN. THE LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OFF, THE DOORS WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOCK, AND ANOTHER PROBLEM STARED--THE SYMBOL FOR A DOOR NOT CLOSED WOULD STAY ON. NO MATTER IF I RE-RE-RE- CLOSED THE DOORS. I TOOK IT BACK TO AAMCO. THEY SAID TO TAKE IT TO A SHOP THAT SPECIALIZED IN THIS PROBLEM. WELL, I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THE DEALER HERE IS SUPPOSED TO FIX THE PROBLEMS AT NO COST.

I SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A MOLD THAT IS INDIGINOUS TO THIS AREA THAT FINDS THE A/C VENTS A FURTILE BREEDING GROUND.  THE SMELL HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY CASA FORD, BUT THEY FAILED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM.  I COMPLAIN TO FORD \"CUSTOMER CARE\"  BUT THEY DON'T CARE.",
