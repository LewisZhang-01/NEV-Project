LUCKLY I DISCOVERED THAT THE FRONT DOORS WERE NOT LOCKED AND THAT IT WAS A MALFUNCTION OF THE BACK DOOR MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN THAT DOOR. THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN DISTRASTROUS AND NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF REPAIRING THE WINDOW HAD I BEEN ABLE TO BREAK IT, THINGS TURNED OUT WELL THANK GOODNESS BUT IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE THE RESULTS COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT.

I  COMPLIED. SHORTLY THERE AFTER MY ABS LIGHT STARTED BLINKING ON AND OFF IRREGULARLY. THEN AFTER A VERY FEW MILES IT STAYED ON ALL THE TIME THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING. I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED AND THEY SAID THAT THE ABS HAD NOTHING TO  DO WITH THE RECALL ISSUE . THAT MY BRAKES WOULD STILL WORK, THAT THE ABS JUST EFFECTS THE NONE SKID PREVENTION IN SLIPPERY CONDITIONS.             WE TOOK THE MOTOR HOME ON A TRIP TO BIRMINGHAM, (ABOUT 100 MILES) DURING THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY. ON 11-24-07 WHILE LEAVING THE CAMPGROUNDS AT ABOUT 20 MPH THE ENGINE QUIT LIKE YOU TURNED OFF THE KEY. A MINOR INSPECTION INDICATED THE MAIN POWER FUSE TO THE COMPUTER HAD BLOWN. . I  HAD A WRECKER TOW THE MOTOR HOME TO A DEALERSHIP. THE FOLLOWING MONDAY MORNING I CONTACTED THE SERVICE CENTER AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED, THEY CHECKED IT OUT AND CALLED ME AND SAID THAT A VERY EXPENSIVE WIRING HARNESS HAD WAS SHORTED OUT BY A O2 SENSOR AND IT WOULD COST AROUND $1750.00 TO FIX IT. I SAID OK, FIX IT.           AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE DONE I BROUGHT IT  HOME AND HAVEN'T USED IT SENSE.            IN FEBRUARY 2008 I GOT ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE THAT THE PART THEY PUT IN MY MOTOR HOME IN THE PREVIOUS RECALL WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY SYSTEM AND COULD CAUSE A FIRE  AT ANY TIME AND IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT IT BE CHANGED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I COMPLIED.            MY QUESTION AND CONCERN IS CAN I TRUST THIS 1998 FORD F350 ON THE ROAD. ALSO I AM RETIRED ON A FIXED INCOME AND I DON'T THINK I SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED TO BARE THE COST OF AN OBVIOUS AUTOMOBILE  MANUFACTURE SCREW UP.
