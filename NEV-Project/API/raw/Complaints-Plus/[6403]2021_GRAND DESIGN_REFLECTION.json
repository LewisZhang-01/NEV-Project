        "summary": "While parked in an RV park I discovered that the right rear spring hanger on my fifth wheel RV had fractured and separated immediately adjacent to a weld line.  I am unaware of any incident that can explain this damage, although I did hear a clunk while auto leveling the vehicle at our campsite.  (Auto leveling is computer controlled and is a routine operation.)  Inspection of the intact left rear spring hanger reveals what appears to be a small crack that may be the beginning of a similar problem on that side.  An undetected failed spring hanger when traveling at highway speeds can obviously be a cause of severe property damage and death.  Research of this problem in user groups and forums revealed that it is well known to vehicle owners.  Anecdotes of broken hangers abound, as do user-invented fixes.   Interestingly, Lippert (aka LCI, who is the manufacturer of the vehicle frame) reportedly has a repair for the problem that it has retrofitted to some vehicles and is apparently using in some newly manufactured vehicle frames.  The fix is to add a 'V-brace' that is welded to the spring hangers and increases their strength.  Example: https://gdrvowners.com/forum/operation/suspension-amp-brakes/52915-spring-hanger-advice  There are no recalls for my trailer suspension that I can find, so despite apparent knowledge of the issue the manufacturers of both the frame and the vehicle have failed to warn me or others of it.  I am now working with both Grand Design and Lippert to solve this problem on my vehicle.  I will press for confirmation that the 'V-brace' is a viable repair that won't violate my warranty and will press to have it implemented on my fifth wheel RV.",

        "summary": "Improper routing of 110v wiring on RV Gas/Electric Refrigerator circuit wiring leads to wire contacting the refrigerator \"chimney\" (boiler flue) which over time burns through the wire insulation cover and results in \"live wire\" to metal contact and can lead to FIRE!  Grand Design RV is aware of this issue!  One customer had a fire as a result of this poor installation practice and posted the info on Facebook, stating Grand Design, a Fire Inspector for the Insurance Company and an agent for Norcold Refrigerator determined the cause of the fire as improperly routed wiring.  Grand Design has not alerted owners of this potential critical safety issue with a Safety Bulletin, VIN Recall or any other means to alert owners of the hazard.  After reading it, we inspected our unit and found the same issue.  Grand Design failed to authorize an Emergency Inspection and Repair for 3 business days (4.5days total) despite me notifying them of the fire in another unit. I also informed them that on Grand Design Owners Technical Forum, several other owners are finding the same issue.   We hired (at our expense) a Mobile RV Service Technician to inspect and repair our wiring. He found the wire in question to be completely burnt through to the individual wires. It was a matter of time before we would have a fire as well. He made the necessary repairs on 15 June 2021 and we filed a Warranty Claim with Grand Design.  We had no circuit breakers trip or any other indication that there was an electrical wiring issue. The refrigerator worked normally and was drawing the correct amperage and all outlets worked normally.  Grand Design's poor routing and installation of the wires is creating a significant safety hazard and their failure to notify customers in any way of the potential hazard is very disturbing. Coupled with their lack of urgency in addressing the issue when I called in can possibly lead to unsuspecting owners having fires that could lead to serious injury and death.",

        "summary": "We have taken two trips with trailer and (Tow vehicle - 2021 Ram 2500). First trip in April 2021 of about 150 miles round trip no problems were encountered. Second trip in May 2021 with a round trip of 380 miles we had repeated instances of \"Check Trailer Brake Wiring\" and \"trailer disconnected\" appear on dash. These warnings would disappear after a few moments.  When safe to do so after first instance (and the warning was off) I pulled off the road and checked connection and trailer brakes by engaging the emergency trailer brake switch and trying to pull away. It appeared that the trailer brakes held. This cycle continued for trip to and from RV park. This month, I made an appointment at the RV Dealer, hooked up the trailer, checked operation of turn signals and brake lights and checked that the trailer brakes would engage. They did.  When pulling out of storage lot, the warnings appeared, I tried to engage the trailer brake emergency brake while the warning was still on the dash and found No trailer brakes. I proceeded to drive to the RV dealer and the warning disappeared and brakes seemed to function.  While I believe the truck brakes will stop the trailer at slow speeds, I am worried about the situation at highway speeds. Trailer is at the dealer waiting in a repair queue. I had telephoned the Grand Design RV customer service line and was told they weren't aware of a problem. However, a friend with the same year and model trailer but a different tow vehicle has encountered the same brake warning issue.",

We get a warning through the brake controller that the trailer is disconnected or to \"check trailer brake wiring.\"  The warning will go away and the electric brakes will work again, only to have the problem return with the complete loss of trailer brakes.  This problem occurred on our very first outing with the new 5th wheel trailer.  We have contacted Grand Design customer service through telephone and email, but have received no response.  We have scheduled a service appointment to have this issue investigated, but the service department at General RV in Huntley, IL has pushed out our appointment several weeks as they are quite busy.  Having no brakes on a 5th wheel trailer that weighs close to 12,000 lbs. loaded is obviously quite concerning to us.",
