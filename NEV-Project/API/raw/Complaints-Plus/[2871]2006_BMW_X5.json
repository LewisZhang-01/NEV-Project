        "summary": "This car has relatively few miles (85k), and has always been operated by a single person.  The passenger seat cushion has a sensor mat that activates the passenger airbag.  With relatively fewer miles and very few passengers, the passenger seat didn't experience the normal use as likely modeled by BMW.  However, during the fall of 2020, (during the height of covid), a warning light stating the passenger air bag had a malfunction.  We were in the midst of nursing and the warning light then went out during the first three months of 2021.    When it came on again in May, 2021, I asked BMW about it as was told, \"That's Campaign 13V-564.  The front passenger airbag seat occupancy sensor mat isn't working.  This means, if there's an accident, the airbag protecting the passenger won't deploy.\"  Apparently there as a \"safety check\" on this in 2014 and the recall closed as of January 2021....so, I was four months past the expiration date of their safety check for this important malfunctioning seat cushion.    As advised by a BMW representative, I requested \"goodwill assistance\" with covering all or some of this repair (estimated at approx $2k).  I was just told that BMW will not provide any goodwill assistance with this and there is apparently no one within BMW Customer  Relations I can escalate this to.  So, I am reaching-out to the NHTSA in hopes someone can assist me in navigating this.  It seems to me, an important safety item such as a passenger sensor for airbag deployment on a car with fewer miles (and passengers) than average, experiencing a brief warning that didn't repeat during covid when we were unable to get to a BMW dealership, and for a \"safety check\" issue that just ended prior to us contacting BMW to repair is something I don't think BMW should be able to dodge.",

IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR I BROUGHT MY X5 TO BMW TO HAVE BMW REVIEW THE AIRBAG ISSUE .  THE TECHNICIANS AT BMW DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILING PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPANCY MAT.  THE TOTAL COST TO ME FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE FAILED PASSENGER SEAT  OCCUPANCY MAT WAS $1,460.89 + MA SALES TAX OF $39.15.   I RECENTLY FOUND THAT ON 11/18/2013 BMW ISSUED A RECALL RELATING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPANT DETECTION MAT.

MY RESPONSE WAS THAT PERHAPS THE REPLACEMENT PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPANCY MAT THAT FAILED MANY YEARS AGO THAT BMW INSTALLED AS A REPLACEMENT WHEN MY VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY WAS IN FACT A PART THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECENT RECALL.  THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAD A VERY GOOD POINT, AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WRITE TO NHTSA TO REQUEST THAT MY VEHICLE BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT REIMBURSE ME.

I NOTICED A BUNCH OF METAL THROW OFF IN THE OIL FILTER AND THE VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE COMPRESSION IN CYLINDER 2 AND 6. I WAS THINKING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE.      SINCE I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AMERICAN/JAPANESE VEHICLES, I DECIDED TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM MYSELF AFTER GETTING NO RESPONSE FROM BMWNA. THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY WITH 85K MILES.      THE METAL THROW OFF WAS DUE TO THE TIMING CHAIN JUMPING OFF OF THE EXHAUST CAM GEAR AND GRINDING AGAINST THE BACK OF IT. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS THE TWO ALUMINUM SCREWS UNDER THE CAM SHAFT GEARS. BOTH HEADS WERE BROKEN OFF AND ONE MADE ITS WAY UP THE CHAIN GETTING CAUGHT IN THE CHAIN AND GEAR. THESE SCREWS ARE ALUMINUM. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM BUT FOR THE BOLTS TO BREAK IT WOULD BE DUE OVER TORQUED/TIGHTEN BOLTS OR EXTREME PRESSURE FROM EXPANDING/CONTRACTING OF THE MAGNESIUM VS ALUMINUM. THE OTHER BROKEN BOLT HEAD IS STILL SOME WHERE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE OIL PAN. THE EXHAUST CAM GEAR WAS CHEWED UP, BUT STILL SERVICEABLE. I RE-TIMED THE CAR AND CHECKED THE COMPRESSION. I GOT LUCKY AND COMPRESSION IS GOOD SO NO BENT VALVES. I DISASSEMBLE EVERYTHING AND NOW I PATIENTLY WAITING FOR SEVERAL PARTS.
