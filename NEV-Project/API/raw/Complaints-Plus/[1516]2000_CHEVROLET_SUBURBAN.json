THE PROBLEM STARTED OUT ONCE SO OFTEN AND AROUND AUG. 2005 IT HAPPENED EVERYTIME I DROVE MY VEHICLE AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND HAD IT REPAIRED.  BOTH FRONT SPEED SENSORS WERE REMOVED AND CLEANED SENSOR MOUNTING SURFACES.  TO ME THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM.  THIS IS NOTHING I COULD PREVENT FROM HAPPENING.  DEFECTIVE MATERIAL.

HE WENT STRAIGHT MIDWAY THROUGH THE TURN AND APPLIED THE BRAKES AS HARD AS HE COULD.  LUCKILY, NO CARS WERE APPROACHING AND HE EVENTUALLY STOPPED.  I HAD THE SUBURBAN TOWED TO THE DEALER AND WAS INFORMED THAT A RECALL WAS IN PROGRESS FOR MY VEHICLE AND THE PARTS AND LABOR WOULD BE REPLACED FOR FREE.  I WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE REPAIR ON MY VISA AND THEN BE REIMBURSED.  I CALLED GM AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND THE REIMBURSEMENT FORMS.  THEY THEN CALLED ON MARCH 17TH AND SAID THAT MY VEHICLE WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE VIN RECALL RANGE BUT WAS IN THE SAME YEAR AND I WOULD NOT BE REIMBURSED.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE PARTS THAT WERE RECALLED WERE IN MY VEHICLE BUT GM CLAIMS THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT AFFECTED.  HERE IS THE RECALL DESCRIPTION FROM GM - \"THE HYDRAULIC PUMP DRIVESHAFT CAN FRACTURE IN THE 98,221 VEHICLES MENTIONED, WHICH CAUSES IMMEDIATE LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST AND CAN RESULT IN LOSS OF BRAKING ASSIST\".   THE REPAIR WAS OVER $600 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, MANY OF THE VEHICLES WITH THE BAD PARTS (LIKE MINE) WILL NOT BE RECALLED AND SOMEONE COULD EASILY BE KILLED ( A PEDESTRIAN, A HEAD ON CRASH, ETC).

FORTUNATELY, I HAD LEFT I-95, WHER I HAD BEEN TRAVELLING FOR 10 1/2 HOURS AT 70 MPH, AND WAS TRAVELLING ON A SIDE ROAD.  THERE WAS NO WARNING.  THE WHEEL MADE A LOUD, GRINDING NOISE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY LOCKED UP.

CONSIDERING THE WAY THAT THE VEHICLE HANDLED WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I AM SURE THAT IF IT HAD HAPPENED 10 MINUTES EARLIER, WHILE I WAS TRAVELLING ON I-95 AT 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE WOULD HVE CAREENED OUT OF CONTROL CAUSING MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND SERIOUS INJURY TO MYSELF AND FAMILY.  COINCIDENTIALLY, I HAD THE VEHICLE SERVICED JUST THE DAY BEFORE AT THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER IN BRUNSWICK, GEORGIA, AND HAD REQUESTED THAT THE FRONT END BE EXAMINED PRIOR TO THE LONG DRIVE AHEAD AND DUE TO A RATTLE THAT I HAD NOTICED.

I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS AND BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN BY COASTING.  ALL THIS TRANSPIRED IN ABOUT 4 TO 10 SECONDS.  THEN BANG, WE HEAR A LOUD NOISE, AND OUR VEHICLE REAR DROPS.  I LOOKED BEHIND ME AND I SEE TREAD AND PEICES OF TIRE FLYING EVERYWHERE.  I COASTED FOR A FEW SECONDS, NOT WANTING TO UPSET THE BALANCE OF THE VEHICLE AND THEN GENTLY APPLIED THE BRAKES.  WE STOPPED.  THE ONLY THING LEFT ON THE RIM WERE THE TWO SIDE WALLS.  THERE WASN'T ANY TREAD LEFT.  I HAVE SINCE RETRIVED THE TREAD.  THE TREAD IS SEPARATED FROM THE CARCUS OF THE TIRE.  I ASSUME THIS IS THE REPEATING THUD SOUND I HEARD.  THEN THE TIRE CARCUS AND TREAD RIPPED COMPLETELY FROM THE SIDE WALLS.  MY RIM IS SCRATCHED AND DENTED.  GM SAYS THIS COST $480.  TIRE IS OBVIOUSLY GONE.  ABOUT 2,000 MILES EARLIER I HAD FIRESTONE, CHECK, AND ROTATE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT I CHECKED THE OTHER TIRES AND TIRE PRESSURES WHERE 35PSI +OR - 2PSI.  UPON EXAMINATION OF THE TREAD THAT CAME OFF TIRE IT CAN BE SEEN THAT THERE IS A PUNCTURE WHICH LOOKS LIKE A NAIL OR SCREW PENETRATED THE TIRE.  MY GM DEALERSHIP IS SAYING THAT THIS CAUSED THE TIRE PRESSUE TO GO DOWN AND I DROVE ON IT SO IT GOT HOT AND THIS CAUSED THE FAULURE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE TIRE MAY HAVE LOST SOME PRESSURE, BUT I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY A SLOW LEAK.  MY WIFE AND I DIDN'T NOTICE A LOW TIRE BY THE WAY THE VEHICLE WAS HANDLING.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE LOW PRESSURE MAY HAVE PRECIPITATED THE TIRE FAILURE, BUT THE TIRE WAS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T HAVE FAILED SO CATASTOPHICALLY WITH ONLY A MINOR TIRE PRESSURE LOSS.

UPON REPLACING THE TIRE I  SAW THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PUNCTURE OR NAILS TO THE TIRE. A  FEW MINUTES LATER AFTER I HAD PUT MY SPARE TIRE ON, I STOPPED AND INFLATED THE FLAT TIRE TO SEE WHERE THE DAMAGE MIGHT BE. AFTER INFLATING TO ABOUT 10 PSI I STOPPED BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT THE SIDEWALL NEAR THE OUTSIDE EDGE(NEAR TREAD) HAD A VERY SOFT SPOT THAT I COULD HAVE PROBABLY PUSHED MY FINGER THROUGH. IT WAS ALMOST AS SOFT AND THIN AS A INNER TUBE. THEN I ALSO NOTICED SEVERAL LUMPS ABOUT 1 TO1 1/2 INCHES IN DIAMETER ALMOST ALL THE WAY AROUND THE TIRE CASING NEAR THE OUTER EDGE. THIS WAS ALL ON THE WHITE LETTER SIDE OF THE TIRE. I BRIEFLY LOOK AT THE BACK SIDE BUT DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING. ALL THE TIME I NEVER HEARD AN AIR LEAK, ALTHOUGH AN HOUR LATER IT WAS FLAT AGAIN. AS I STATED EARLIER I ONLY PUT APPX. 10 PSI. WHEN I SAW THE KNOTS APPEAR I STOPED IN FEAR OF THE CASING RUPTURING. IT DEFINITLEY APPEARS TO BE AN INTERNAL PROBLEM SUCH AS BELT OR PLY SEPARATION. BEFORE I CONTACT CHEVROLET OR FIRESTONE I WANTED TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION SINCE I THINK THIS MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM THE THE OTHER RECALLED TIRES AND DID NOT WANT THE EVIDENCE(MY TIRE)  POSSIBLY LOST OR DESTROYED WITH YOU HAVING A CHANCE TO SEE IT IF YOU WISH.
