THIS IS A LIPPERT ISSUE IN MY OPINION BUT THE UNIT AS MENTIONED IS MADE BY VANLEIGH RV.    MY RV SUFFERED THIS ISSUE AND UPON A QUERY TO SEVERAL OTHER VANLEIGH RV OWNERS ITS A COMMON THEME. A QUICK REVIEW OF OTHER RV FORUMS FINDS THE SAME ISSUE AND THE FIX IS TO \"BEEF UP\" THE AFFECTED AREA. INFACT I WAS TOLD LIPPERT TECHS KNOW OF THIS ISSUE AND HAVE A PICTURE OF A \"BEEFED UP\" HANGER.    I SPOKE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AT VANLEIGH AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE.    IM HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE PICTURES IF NEEDED AND PROVIDE WEBLINKS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH THIS SAME LIPPERT FRAME ISSUE.",
