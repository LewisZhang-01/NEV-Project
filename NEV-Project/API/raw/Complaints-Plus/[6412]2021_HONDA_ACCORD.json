It was kept outside overnight on Friday and temperatures were in the 20s. I used my rear defroster for the very first time on Saturday morning and returned home Saturday. On Sunday morning, I closed the door of the car and the rear glass shattered and collapsed. It seems like they may have a batch of badly tempered glass but refuse to acknowledge it. They required me to have the car towed to the dealership. This damages any investigation value and they said it looked like a hammer smashed it in but it didn\u2019t look like that when it was at my home. I had police come and look at it and they did not find any evidence of vandalism. The location of the damage is VERY centered and would be hard to reach and not likely the spot for someone just trying to smash the window.",

A few weeks after purchase the TPMS came on so I had the tires checked at Les Schwab. I was told all the tire were low, likely due to weather. Within a couple weeks the TPMS came on again, I returned to Les Schwab on 12/18/21. I was told all the tires were a little low again but that the rear drives tire was at 19 Psi. I was told again it was likely weather but that the rear drivers tire was a little lower than the rest and if the TPMS came on again to return. On the evening of 12/23/21 the TPMS came on again. I took my car to Les Schwab again and about 11am and was told they could fill the tires, but they could try to find and fix the problem because they would close at 1pm and they did not have time but to bring it back on Monday. Despite my pleas, they refused. I tried calling the Regional Manager at his store but every time I called someone answered and either hung up or put the call on hold but did not answer.   On 12/25/21 at about 6:50pm while driving about 55 mph on the I-5 freeway in Portland, OR., I was in the center lane and heard a loud pop. My stirring wheel pulled right and as I held tight, I heard another loud, dull, grinding noise from the front passenger side of the car. I slowed, turned on my hazard lights and waited for traffic to stop so I could pull to the side of the freeway. I looked and saw that the front passenger side tire tread had completely detached from the sidewall. I then called to have to car towed back to my home.",
