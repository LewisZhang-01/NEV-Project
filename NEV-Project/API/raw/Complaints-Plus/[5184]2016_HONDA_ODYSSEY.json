He saw the red light and was breaking.  There were two other witnesses in the car. My husband drives with his right foot and never breaks with his left foot. Though the car was stopping the engine was racing and the car was accelerating despite having his foot on the break petal. Unexpected acceleration is what the dealership called it. No he didn't have both feet on both petals. The car was accelerating despite his foot on the break petal. The witness confirm the car was trying to stop but the engine was racing. We took the car into the dealership and they brought in the \"Honda Engineer\" who checked out the car and found nothing wrong. They found the floor mats were pinned into place and were not a factor. The dealership seems to want to blame this on \"driver error\" and deny that there is anything wrong with the vehicle. The service manage with his left foot indicated as if he was breaking with his left foot when explaining that they believe it wasn't mechanical. In other words, they are saying it was driver error (with their body language). I believe they are deny deny deny and not taking our concerns into account. I did a search of similar issues with Honda Odysse's and found that there are other reports of this type of \"unexpected acceleration\". Thank You.",

I paid them $1,500 for the repair but it continued to happen.  They informed that they could not duplicate the problems therefore can't fix it.

Diagnostic tool shows P0301 for misfire in cylinder 1 and P0848 for trans fluid pressure switch faulty.  The dealer informed that we have defective piston rings which cause spark plugs misfire and foul. This will cost 5K and they will not guaranteed that it will fix it!  My engine problems seems to be similar to the class action suit as per case no. 3:12-cv-1377-si. Unfortunately, it would appear that the defective piston rings issue was not resolved. I'm concerned that any replacement will result in the same issue again with continued driving. Honda dealerships are aware of the issue and Honda offers us very minimal assistance on the repair. However, they should be fully liable for selling cars with defective design, especially after the prior case. When this issue occurred, it put my family in an unsafe condition because vehicle suddenly lost power and the engine began to stutter. At this point my vehicle is undrivable and this has contributed to financial burden in an already difficult year due to the pandemic.

The issue still keeps happening.  They said the Torque converted needs to be replaced but it is national backorder.  But since it is on backorder, They can not do anything about it.  They are saying the car is safe to drive and that driving it will not cause damage the transmission.  This seems very unlikely.",

        "summary": "My family was recently faced with unnecessary added stress with what appears to be a design flaw in the child safety lock feature on my 2016 Honda Odyssey purchased in 2019 from Ed Napleton Honda in Illinois. I felt the need to bring my concerns to your attention as I\u2019m concerned for not only my son\u2019s safety, but any other families that could face a similar frightening situation. Last weekend, while I was driving the car on the interstate outside of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, despite having turned the child safety locks on, my seven year old was able to squeeze his finger in between the space of the door and the side panel to reach the child safety lock, flip the position to un- locked, and open the sliding door while I was driving 70mph. I was very fortunate that I was able to pull over and call for safety assistance; however, it goes without saying that this situation could\u2019ve ended much differently.  Upon returning home, I took video of my older son being able to recreate the situation by manipulating the child safety lock from inside. I have this video if you want to see it.   I purchased what I believed to be a vehicle full of adequate safety features. Now, I\u2019m extremely concerned with my ability (or lack thereof) to safely transport my son at this time knowing this design flaw exists. I urge you to escalate this issue for immediate recall consideration to avoid potentially dire consequences.",

When you come to a full stop, car starts again and works fine.  The problem is extremely dangerous if driving of a freeway or other multi lane, higher speed road.   We experienced the problem almost immediately after purchasing the car (used, with 28K miles, from Paragon Honda in NY).  We bought the car back to the dealer and they replaced an electrical harness.  THe problem did not reoccur again for around 4 months (we only drive around 10K miles per year), when it happened again on a local road.  Recently, in April and May the problem occurred two more times, with the last occurrence nearly causing a serious accident as we were driving in the left lane on the LIE at around 60mph.  Getting the car to the shoulder with limited brake, steering and acceleration functions, and not having use of the blinker was extremely dangerous.  This is a very serious issue.  Bringing the car back to the dealer, but given the short duration of the initial fix, I fear there is a fundamental defect in the electric system.  Went online to a Honda Odyssey discussion board, and was surprised that there were a number of other similar complaints.  If this is a systemic problem, it is a big one.",

In these instances, the harder the brake was applied, the reaction was almost causing me to lose control of the vehicles due to the extreme vibration/bouncing of the front end, as if both front tires were starting to bounce making it difficult to safely steer the vehicle and stay within my traffic lane. Upon returning home, once out of the more steep mountain driving, both braking and steering operated as expected. I talked to a couple of local garages in the mountains and a couple of Honda dealers locally. The Colorado garages didn't see any problems but said they have heard many such complaints from Honda owners. The local dealers back at home also found no obvious mechanical issues, but quietly confirmed hearing similar complaints and just chalked it up to Honda Van's. I am 70yoa and have never experienced the violent shaking I've had in my two Hondas making me to want to raise this issue to you. I feel a lessor experienced driver would have lost control at a high speed most probably resulting in serious injury or death, and with a high probability that such a loss at a steep grade and speed would easily involve multiple vehicles.",

HONDA SERVICE PEOPLE CALL IT THE 'PISTON RING PROBLEM' AS IT IS A WELL KNOW MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT HONDA DESCRIBES IN TSB 13-081 AND RESULTED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (CASE NO. 3:12-CV-1377-SI) AGAINST HONDA.

AMERICAN SAID THAT A CASE MANAGER LOOKED AT MY QUESTION, CONTACTED GERALD JONES AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE 1-1.5 HOURS SO AMERICAN WOULD NOT TELL LOCAL GERALD JONES TO DO IT FASTER OR TO MAKE A LOANER VEHICLE AVAILABLE; AMERICAN HONDA BASICALLY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE TO OVERSEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICE BY INDEPENDENT LOCAL DEALERS IN ACCOMPLISHING THE RECALL YOU BOTH SAID SHOULD TAKE ONLY 30 MINUTES. WE ARRIVED TO APPOINTMENT EARLY AND HAD TICKET SUBMITTED EVEN BEFORE APPOINTMENT TIME. MY WIFE AND KID THEN JUST SAT IN WAITING ROOM FOR 1.5 HOURS WITH NOBODY GIVING ANY UPDATES UNTIL SOMEONE ASKED IF EVERYONE WAS OK TO WHICH MY WIFE RESPONDED THAT SHE WANTED AN UPDATED ON OUR VAN. 15 MINUTES LATER, THAT PERSON STILL HADN'T RETURNED WITH AN UPDATE SO MY WIFE WENT OUT TO SERVICE AREA TO GET HER OWN UPDATE. IT'S FINALLY DONE AS OF ALMOST 2 HOURS AFTER APPOINTMENT TIME, BUT NEEDS SOME FINAL PAPERWORK. SHE IS THEN ESCORTED 1/2 WAY TO VAN AND SHOWN WHERE IT IS. SHE ARRIVES AT VAN WITH KID IN TOW ONLY TO LEARN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TWO CHILD CAR SEATS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND LEFT IN THE TRUNK. NOBODY GAVE A HEADS UP. NOBODY OFFERED TO GIVE HER ASSISTANCE TO GET THE CAR SEAT INSTALLED WHILE ALSO WRANGLING THE TODDLER.

THE SCREEN HAS WHAT LOOKS LIKE BURNED SPOTS THAT RADIATE INTO DISCOLORATION OF MIXED COLORS OF BLUE, RED, GREEN, ORANGE, PURPLE AND COVERS HALF OF THE SCREEN.

THE VEHICLE WAS ABOUT 150 INTO THE TURN, ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY FROM THE POLE WHEN IT SUDDENLY SURGED AND ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN. I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE I WAS VERY AWARE THAT MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. I STEPPED DOWN ON IT, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. THE VAN SURGED INTO THE REST OF THE TURN AND SLAMMED INTO THE PARKING POLE LEAVING A DEEP DENT IN THE FRONT BUMPER. BECAUSE I FELT UNSAFE DRIVING IT, IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE CENTER. THE NEXT DAY, AFTER CHECKING THE CAR'S COMPUTER, HONDA FOUND NO FAULT CODES SO COULD OFFER NO REASSURANCES THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
