I was bounced around from operators at the dealership before being told I wouldn\u2019t be able to be seen until Sept. 14th (20 days later) and that I should stop driving the vehicle. I work over 50 miles away from my office and told the person I spoke to that it wasn\u2019t an option for me to stop driving the vehicle because I need my source of income to support myself. I also informed them that I don\u2019t have any other form of transportation and asked if I could get a loaner vehicle until they could check out my vehicle. I was told they wouldn\u2019t be able to provide me a loaner vehicle until my vehicle was inspected and deemed unsafe to operate.   So I continued driving my vehicle. I\u2019ve probably put close to 2000 miles on my vehicle since the phone call with Cadillac. Needless to say my transmission went out Friday at a very low mileage. Cadillac is refusing to help me and I feel like I wouldn\u2019t need an entire new transmission had the Cadillac dealer not made me wait nearly 3 weeks to be seen. My toe link is also busted. Now I\u2019m looking at spending $5500 on a vehicle I can\u2019t even drive due to Cadillacs negligence plus I\u2019m now on the hook for a rental vehicle while I\u2019m still making payments on the Cadillac I cannot even drive. How do you expect people to survive when I\u2019m getting quoted over $1800 for 4 weeks of a rental car while I wait for my vehicle to get fixed - most places cannot get a transmission for 3-4 weeks. I\u2019m being quoted $7000 (which is more than I make in 2 months) because Cadillac blew me off had they checked my vehicle before the transmission went out they may have prevented me from needing a new transmission.

IF NHTSA IS TRULY \"PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE\", GETTING THIS ISSUE ADDRESSED BY CADILLAC SHOULD BE EASY.  BULBS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND MADE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE. HEADLIGHT REPLACEMENT IS WELL OVER A $1,000.00 AT DEALER.  NEW HEADLIGHTS WILL ALSO START TO DETERIORATE AS SOON AS THEY ARE USED DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW IN THE LIGHTS.  WE BOUGHT THIS CAR USED IN 2016 AND STARTED TO NOTICE HOW DIM THE HEADLIGHTS WERE BECOMING. EVERYWHERE WE TURN, THERE HAS BEEN NO REMEDY OFFERED.",

I WOULD HOPE THAT MY COMPLAINT, ALONG WITH THE COMPLAINTS OF HUNDREDS OF OTHERS, WILL PROMPT THE GOVERNMENT TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THIS FRAUDULENT ACT.

AFTER 9 DIFFERENT TIMES OVER 2 1/2 YEARS, WE FINALLY INSISTED THEY BE CHECKED, AFTER OUR WARRANTY HAD RECENTLY EXPIRED. THEN THEY CONFIRMED THERE WAS AN INTERNAL FAULT WITH THE LAMPS AND THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED, AT A COST OF $1,100. WE CONTACTED GM WITH OUR COMPLAINT. THE BEST THEY WILL DO IS INSTALL THEM FOR FREE, BUT WE HAVE TO PAY OVER $800 FOR NEW LAMPS. WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT STARTING BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR MANY. WE LITERALLY CANNOT SEE AT NIGHT OR BEFORE DAYLIGHT WITHOUT USING OUR HIGH BEAMS. WE NOW WILL REPLACE THEM OURSELVES WITH AFTER MARKET PARTS BUT THAT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM. WE SAW A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON YOUR WEBSITE. WHAT MAKES US ANGRY IS THAT WE WERE LITERALLY BLOWN OFF WITH OUR COMPLAINT 9 TIMES AT VARIOUS DEALERSHIPS (ATTACHMENT HAS ALL THESE DOCUMENTED) BEFORE A DEALERSHIP SAID THEY HAD JUST DIAGNOSED THIS PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER AFTER SHE INSISTED THE SERVICE ADVISOR DRIVE IT HOME ONE NIGHT. IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND A DEFECT. WE ASSURE YOU, CADILLAC IS AWARE OF IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF US DRIVING UNSAFELY. WE TRY TO AVOID DRIVING AT NIGHT OR DUSK BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE.",

I WAS DRIVING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL ROAD AT ABOUT 25MPH WHEN I CAME TO THE STOP SIGN AT THE END OF THE ROAD WHERE I WAS TURNING RIGHT.  I COASTED UP TO THE STOP SIGN AND LOOKED TO THE LEFT AND IT WAS CLEAR AND THEN PROCEEDED TO TURN RIGHT. I PRESSED ON THE GAS AND IT VERY SLOWLY MOVED ME INTO THE LANE AND THEN STOPPED, IT WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL. I DEPRESSED THE GAS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I DIDN'T HEAR THE ENGINE REV AS IF IT WAS IN NEUTRAL OR ANYTHING, IT WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS DEAD. I DIDN'T SEE ANY INDICATOR LIGHTS ON THE DASH BUT I WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD A CAR BEHIND ME THAT I WAS CONCERNED WAS GOING TO REAR END ME AS HE WAS EXPECTING ME TO CONTINUE MOVING AS I TURNED INTO THE ROAD. FORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T A CAR COMING FROM THE LEFT AS I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT SINCE I AS SITTING THERE DIABLED IN THE ROAD.  AFTER ABOUT 4 SECONDS THE CAR FINALLY RESPONDED AND TOOK OFF. I HAD THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN SO WHEN IT FINALLY ENGAGED MY TIRES SQUEALED AND I TOOK OFF.     SO HERE ARE THE DETAILS: TIME OF INCIDENT WAS 4:02PM ON 11/28/2013 AND THE CAR HAD 1521 MILES ON THE ODO AND A FULL TANK OF GAS. THE CAR HAD BEEN SITTING ABOUT 4 HRS AND I HAD BEEN DRIVING THE CAR ABOUT 1.5 MILES WHEN IT OCCURRED. THE OUTSIDE TEMP WAS 64 DEGREES.     IF THE CAR DIDN'T MOVE ME FORWARD INTO THE ROAD AND IT JUST DIDN'T RESPOND AT THE STOP SIGN THAT WOULDN'T BE NEARLY AS BAD BUT IT MOVES YOU ABOUT 5 FEET INTO TRAFFIC AND THEN STOPS RESPONDING FOR ABOUT 4 SECONDS AND IF THERE WAS AN ON COMING CAR I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT.    THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS OF THIS HAPPENING ON THIS FORUMS AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE IN THESE CARS (PARTICULARLY THE 2013). THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND CADILLAC NEEDS TO FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE PEOPLE ARE HURT OR DIES DUE TO THIS MALFUNCTION.  *TR",
