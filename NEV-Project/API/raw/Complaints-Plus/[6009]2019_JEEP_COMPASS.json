Engine stalled 4 times already this month after a quick error message \"coolant temperature too high\" was displayed and immediately disappeared. But enough for the engine to stop completely. It happened at freeway exit ramp, driveway ramp, traffic light. Someone will get KILLED. I contacted Jeep. No help even though they are aware of this issue. Dealer could not recreate problem. Paid a fortune. Got it out of the dealer and it is still doing it. I can't keep driving like this. I called my old mechanic and he said that only a dealer can do a software update since it seems it is a glitch. Dealer updated software. Still doing it.  Somebody needs to take this seriously before it is too late. I need somebody to help me. This site mentions this issue multiple times and shows that JEEP is aware of this issue. No dealer has been able to fix it: https://www.myjeepcompass.com/threads/error-message-%E2%80%9Chigh-coolant-temperature%E2%80%9D.44398/ Thank you.",

This error occurs at any time of the day, regardless of whether the vehicle is cold in the morning or after driving for several hours; sometimes it occurs several times a week and sometimes not at all for weeks; the vehicle may be stopped at a traffic light or in motion on the highway, a particular situation that worries me greatly, because when this happens, the vehicle locks up for an instant (approximately one second) in which the steering hardens and the vehicle tends to stop abruptly, and I fear that this may cause damage to my car or even worse cause an accident.  This situation has been reported since the first time it happened (about 11 months ago) and I have had to go to the garage about 10-15 times. In each occasion the technical team has tried to solve the problem without success, they even replaced a control module, installed updates, ran the scanner, and made long driving tests trying to recreate the condition that causes the error without succeeding.",

The webbing fabric may have been irregular too. It is very strange, I will attach photos. I don't know when or how the damage occurred because I rarely have passengers in my vehicle. It was discovered yesterday when I did have a rider.  The damage is too high up on the belt to have been chewed by the dog. The dog has never been left unattended in the car, is too small to have reached the belt, and is secured in the back seat with a harness and locking tether while traveling.  One dealer, C.H. Urness Motors in The Dalles, OR, wanted to charge me over $300 for repair and make me wait 3 months for the part despite my car being under warranty. They offered to expediate the process to five days for an additional fee. Supposedly the part is out of stock but for and additional charge, it can become \"in stock\" in five days. University Auto in Ellensberg, WA is attempting to make the repairs under warranty. I should hear back from them in the next few days. I am concerned that I can not safely transport passengers until the repair is made, that one dealer is attempting to overcharge and make me wait for the repair, and that there may be an issue with the manufacture of the seatbelt itself.

I changed the battery and still had the issue that the car wouldn't start. I brought to Chrysler Jeep and they changed the secondary battery and they reset it so i don't get the A symbol with exclamation point.  Picked up my car from oil change, on my way i stopped at a traffic light at an intersection, it stalled on me.  Completely turned off, the radio worked, the windows were able to go up and down.  after a minute it turned back on. I brought it back to the dealer the next day, they had it for 4 hours and they said they didn't find anything wrong with the vehicle and they reset everything and i should be fine now.  That Sunday, it stalled on me 3 times and this time it took 5-10 minutes before it restarted.  It was the scariest moment in my life, i had my 6year old in  my car and this car would not start.  I brought it back to jeep on Monday the 25th and they still have it and they cant figure out what is wrong.  they called me and said that they drove it and there is nothing wrong, i told them i do not want the car back until they fix it.  now its Tuesday, and they still cant figure out the problem, this is a lease vehicle and they wont even give me a loaner until they find the problem.  It just shuts off when you stop always at a traffic light. I told them the 3 things that popped up and they looked at me like im crazy...Service hill start system, service esc system and dynamic steering torque service req'd, they said no codes came up, then they said 2 codes came up but they still cant figure it out.   It is dangerous for your car to stall without notice especially when you are leasing it expecting for it to be ok and no issues.",

While the alarm is active, you are unable to accelerate and have no power steering. After a second, the alarm vanishes and coolant temperature gauge shows temperature back at normal operational level. This has happened while driving 65 MPH on a highway. This also happened while trying to make a left-hand turn at a busy intersection. This is quite frightening and if this were to occur at the wrong moment could easily result in an accident.  Other owners of the same model vehicle have reported this exact same issue in online forums such as MyJeepCompass.com. In all reported cases, dealers and mechanics are unable to determine the problem after replacing the coolant sensor and trying every possible solution.  I believe this is a software or firmware issue causing a false coolant temperature alarm to trigger. I reported this to Jeep and they only recommended bringing the vehicle to a local dealer.",
