THE AIR CONDITIONER COMES ON OFF WHENEVER, WHEN YOU PUT GAS IN THE CAR YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT GAS BEFORE IT WILL STAY RUNNING.

THERE IS A LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD WARNING ABOUT SKIP SHIFT, BUT IT IS HIDDEN BY MY HAND ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR BY THE WHEEL ITSELF WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN.  THE WARNING LIGHT IS USELESS ANYWAY BECAUSE DRIVER'S EYES ARE ON THE ROAD WHEN SHIFTING GEARS.
