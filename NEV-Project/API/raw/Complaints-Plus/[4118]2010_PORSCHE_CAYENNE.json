I TOOK TO A GERMAN CAR SPECIALIST AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT, THE TRANSFER CASE WAS GOING OUT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE COST IS $5400.00. I AM A BIG FAN OF ALL THINGS PORSCHE, BUT THIS ISSUE HAS CAUSED ME TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK INTO BUYING ANOTHER ONE. THIS SHOULD BE AN ISSUE FOR RECALL BY PORSCHE. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT??  I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON TO THE HIGHWAY VIA AN ON RAMP, THE KNOCKING FROM THE TRANSFER CASE SLOWED THE VEHICLE WITH TRAFFIC COMING UP FROM BEHIND. FORTUNATELY, IT PICKED UP SPEED.",
