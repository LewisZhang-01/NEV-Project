Car then lost power steering. Replaced pump. Can began having loss of power while using cruise control and steering would stiffen. Yet, only during inclement weather while driving. The Engine light with emmisions control warning would display and the clear on its on usually over night. Code diagnostics found possible 02 sensor or catalytic converter issues. Roughly six months later car cut off and wouldn't start replaced rack and pinion during to link at main connection. Car began having starting issues  still then not holding charge replace battery twice due to B/S/A reporting pass. About 3 months ago car wouldn't turn over starter was faulty replaced starter. Replaced starter however igintion strained to turn over. To start it began requiring turning car to on then off and immediately to run. Began requesting jump starts. Ran diagnosis at advance auto showed battery issues, starter good and alternator good. Replaced battery and 02 sensor. Can Three weeks wouldn't start after driving to the gas station attempted to jump vehicle but didn't work. Called roadside service; however when service arrived vehicle started with no assistance. Took car for diagnosis test and code displayed ecm issues. Car again after cutting vehicle on and attempting to start car up vehicle wouldn't turn over. Attempted to jump start vehicle and still no crank. Left car and returned 2 hours later and was able to jump start vehicle. Acura website I'd showing decals for emc and power steering recalls on 08 tsx non vin specific search however my specific vin isnt included. How do I register my vin for similar recall issues.",

ON SATURDAY, APRIL 26, 2008 I TEST DROVE A BRAND NEW 2009 MODEL ACURA TSX AT SUNNYSIDE ACURA IN NASHUA NH. IT WAS AROUND NOON TIME AND THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY. SUNNYSIDE'S ACURA SALES CONSULTANT (KRISTINE MILLER) INTRODUCED ME TO THE CAR, ITS ELECTRONICS (THIS WAS A MODEL WITH OPTIONAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM) PRIOR TO DRIVING OFF. THE TEST DRIVE ITSELF WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL I NEEDED TO MAKE A SHARP U-TURN. THE U-TURN WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PULL BACK ONTO SUNNYSIDE'S ACURA PARKING LOT. I WAS THE FIRST CAR AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TO MAKE A U-TURN  AND WHILE MAKING IT I DROVE OVER VERY LOW ROAD DIVIDER. NOBODY WAS INJURED HOWEVER THE CAR ITSELF WAS DAMAGED BY PIECE OF A METAL POST THAT WAS EMBEDDED INTO ROAD DIVIDER. I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME WHY I COULD NOT SEE THE ROAD DIVIDER FROM THE DRIVER SEAT. I HAVE USED THE SAME U-TURN MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY.  I DO NOT MAKE IT A HABIT OF DRIVING OVER OBJECTS ON THE ROAD ' MY DRIVING HISTORY IS A STATEMENT TO THAT. LATER AFTER COMPARING ANOTHER BRAND NEW 2009 TSX DIRECTLY TO MY 1999 TL I REALIZED THAT MY VIEW OF THE ROAD DIVIDER ADJACENT TO MY CAR WAS COMPLETELY OBSTRUCTED BY NEW, 'SAFER', HIGH BELTLINE DOORS OF 2009 MODEL ACURA TSX.    IN LIGHT OF THAT 'DISCOVERY' I ASK FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:    1.WHY WERE THERE ABSOLUTELY NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS NEW SAFETY FEATURE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TO THE FIELD OF VIEW PROVIDED TO ME BY THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE TEST DRIVE?  2.WHY WOULD NO WARNING LABEL ABOUT SUCH A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE BE INCLUDED INSIDE THE CAR?  3.WHY WOULD NOT PROVISIONS BE IMPLEMENTED ON A DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO SEE A BLIND SPOT NEXT TO THE CAR ITSELF?
