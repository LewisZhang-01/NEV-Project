The dashboard illuminated properly but the starter did not engage and the engine did not attempt to crank. Afterwards, a warning lamp would sometimes appear saying \"auto start/stop unavailable\".  This became a safety hazard when the auto start/stop feature shut the engine down at a stop light and the car would not restart when the light turned green. In my case, the light turned green and other cars were approaching the intersection and I could not move out of the way. The problem occurred multiple times on initial startup and while driving in a 3 week period before it the faulty relay was replaced under warranty by my local dealer. The car's ECU recorded P26E4-OO for start stop relay and the dealer had seen the issue before. The part has been upgraded and should proactively be recalled.",

APPROX 10 SECS AFTER STARTING THE ENGINE THE VERY STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE ENTERED THE COCKPIT - I IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  EXITING THE VEHICLE I COULD SEE A TRAIL OF FLUID 10 FT LONG ON THE CONCRETE DRIVEWAY AND THE SCENT IDENTIFIED IT AS GASOLINE.

SEVERAL LITERS OF GASOLINE HAD BEEN EJECTED OVER THE ENGINE.  CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST ALFA SERVICE DEALERSHIP (GOLLING, BLOOMFIELD HILLS).

I CONTACTED ALFA CORPORATE AND THROUGH EMAIL EXCHANGES, DISCOVERED THAT ALFA CORPORATE WILL NOT BE INVESTIGATING THIS SAFETY ISSUE AT ALL.  I ATTACH ALL THE EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE BELOW.  MY VERY SERIOUS CONCERN IS THAT THE DEALERSHIP VERBALLY SAID THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED - \"MAYBE A WEAK SPOT\" - BUT ALFA CORPORATE WOULD INVESTIGATE. AT THAT POINT I WAS SATISFIED.  THEN SEVERAL DAYS LATER ALFA CORPORATE INFORMED ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP GUESS OF \"MAYBE A WEAK SPOT\" WOULD BE THE OFFICIAL CONCLUSION AND END OF THE INVESTIGATION.
