ATTEMPTS TO REPEATEDLY BREAK DID NOT WORK, SO GEAR WAS SHIFTED TO DRIVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AVOID A COLLISION INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD HOME THAT WAS BEHIND THE PARKED CAR.

ATTEMPT TO SHIFT NOW TO PARK ALONG WITH BRAKE DID NOT WORK.  TO AVOID MASSIVE ACCIDENT AND COLLISION WITH PARKED CARS AHEAD, THE DRIVER TURNED THE WHEELS TOWARD A UTILITY POLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  THE CAR STOPPED ONLY AFTER A COLLISION WITH THE UTILITY POLE.  THE CAR WAS SMOKING IN THE BACK AND WAS STILL REVVING WHEN STOPPED.  ACCORDING TO THE DRIVER, CAR WAS MOVING AT SPEED 60 MPH.  NO FLOOR MATS WERE MISPLACED NEAR DRIVER PEDALS. DRIVER WAS ABLE TO GET HELP, AT WHICH POINT 911 CALL WAS MADE. DRIVER WAS TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO FAIRFAX HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. DRIVER SUFFERED FRACTURED NOSE AND TEARS IN FACE THAT REQUIRED SURGICAL REPAIR AND SUTURES. EVENT REPORTED TO BMW NORTH AMERICA, 6-6-2017. MOST PEOPLE WILL TRY TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WAS DRIVER ERROR.

I'VE BEEN THE ONLY OWNER FOR THIS VEHICLE AND NEVER HAD ACCIDENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE CAR, IT'S IN ORIGINAL STATE. I SPOKE TO MY SERVICE ADVISER TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO, HOWEVER IT'S BEEN ALMOST A MONTH AND WON'T EVEN RETURN MY CALLS. I'VE CALLED THEM AT LEAST 20 TIMES DURING THE PAST MONTH, IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR SUCH A REPUTABLE COMPANY LIKE BMW TO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF A KNOWN ISSUE, WHICH I'VE READ ON SEVERAL BMW FORUMS, AND NOW THEY CAN'T EVEN RETURN MY CALLS. IT'S DISAPPOINTING. I GUESS THIS IS MY LAST BMW.  *TT",
