THE HEAT IN THE BACK DOESN'T WORK FOR HER, SO I HAVE SEVERAL BLANKETS FOR HER. THE TELEVISION QUIT LONG AGO, IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WE BOUGHT THE CAR, SO KIDS COULD WATCH TELEVISION ON LONG TRIPS, OR WHENEVER. WE PAID A LOT FOR THIS VEHICLE, I WOULD THINK GMC WOULD STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND CORRECT THE PRODUCT THEY STAND BY,AND ARE VERY PROUD OF. I WOULD LOVE TO JUST PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE. I DO NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY, I LOST MY JOB, WE ARE PAY CHECK TO PAY CHECK WITH MY HUSBANDS INCOME. I CAN'T FIX OR REPLACE THIS CAR, THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED BEFORE ALL THE MALFUNCTIONS/DEFECTS. I HAVE A GARMIN SO I CAN TELL MY SPEED, AND HAVE TO HIT THE SIDE INSIDE THE CAR WHEN THE LIGHTS WON'T WORK.

NOW THAT GM HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAULTY EQUIPMENT WHERE I AM ABLE TO GET THIS FIXED AT NO CHARGE TO ME, GM IS STATING THAT I HAVE EXCEEDED THE 7 YEAR OR 70,000 MILE LIMITATION.

THIS HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN. I  CONTACTED MY LOCAL GMC DEALER REPAIR DEPARTMENT WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON - EVIDENTLY THIS IS QUITE THE COMMON THING WITH THESE TRUCKS AND OTHERS - AND TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT PANEL REPLACED. PRICING AROUND $375 FOR THE PART AND ANOTHER $100 OR SO FOR INSTALLATION. I HAVE INVESTIGATED COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET FOR THIS PROBLEM, WITH GM VEHICLES, AND THERE ARE FAR TOO NUMEROUS OUT THERE FOR THIS TO BE A SINGLE INCIDENT. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A DEFECT. IN MY OPINION, GM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR WITH A RECALL.  I CAN SEE WHERE IT WOULD DEFINITELY CAUSE ALARM AS FAR AS A SAFETY CONCERN. FORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT HAD AN INCIDENT YET, BUT DEFINITELY FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO FURTHER. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT I ALSO SAW ON AN INTERNET WEBSITE FOR LAWYERS THAT THEY ARE GATHERING COMPLAINTS TOGETHER FOR A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST GM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO REPORT THIS FOR INVESTIGATION FIRST.  *JB",

AS I GET CLOSE TO HOME, THE BELL IN THE CAR STARTS TO CHIME, THE ROOF LIGHTS TURN ON, AND ACROSS THE ODEMETER READER, IT READS \"PASSENGER DOOR AJAR\".  I PARKED MY CAR AND HAD HIM SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN.  AS I DROVE OFF, THE BELL CHIMES, THE LIGHTS ARE STILL ON, AND IT STILL READS \"PASSENGER DOOR AJAR\".  SO I GET OUT AND OPEN AND CLOSE ALL THE DOORS INCLUDING THE TRUNK.  SAME PROBLEM.    THIS GOES ON EVEN AFTER I GOT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  TOLD THE SALES MANAGER THE PROBLEM.  HE SAW IT FOR HIMSELF AND TOLD ME TO BRING IT TO THE MECHANICS.  WENT TO THE MECHANICS AND THREE OF THEM SAW THE PROBLEM.  ONE OF THEM RECOGNIZED IT AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A WIRE LOOSE ON THE PASSENGER DOOR.  HE CALLED IT AN \"AUSCHUWAITER\" (SP?).  HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE DOOR APART.      THE MANGER CALLED IT A \"SIMPLE SITUATION\" AND THIS IS WHAT I REPLIED, \"IT'S NOT \"SIMPLE\" WHAT IF I HAD DECIDED TO TAKE THAT DRIVE WITH MY 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND THE PROBLEM OCCURS.  AND IN THE EXCITEMENT, WHILE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, SHE UN-BUCKLES HER SEATBELT AND OPENS THE DOOR, FALLS OUT INTO THE FREEWAY, I PANIC AND LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR.  WE CAUSE THIS HUGE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WITH FATALITIES, MY DAUGHTER COUNTED.\"   MANAGER TOLD ME, IT'S A BIG CAR WITH 100,000 PARTS.  NOT ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE PERFECT.  1/5000 WAS HIS ESTIMATE, PROBLEMATIC WISE.    THE MECHANIC SAID HE HAD SEEN THIS MANY TIMES ON A GMC, BUT I DID NOT SEE ANY COMPLAINTS FILED SO HERE'S MINE.  IT'S JUST BEEN A DAY AFTER I GOT IT REPAIRED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART IN ORDER TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  WE'LL SEE HOW IT HANDLES NOW.  HAD I KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM, I WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED MY BLOOD FOR IT.    THANKS.",
