It would go well only a 100 if I let it and applying the brakes does nothing.  The only way of stopping the vehicle is to put it in neutral and one time that didn't stop it and I had to put it in park and turn off the key.  I've taken the vehicle to 3 different garages and they are not able to figure out what the issue is.  I've contacted Nissan and they have no recalls of this.  I finally looked online and saw that other people have been in accidents because of the same problem.  This vehicle is deadly to drive and I'm a professional driver so luckily I knew what to do when this happens. I am not able to drive truck safely and I'm not able to sell it or even give this to anyon because I would be responsible when they kill someone from the mechanical failures.  I bought the truck for my teenage son and obviously he can't drive it",

IMMEDIATELY, WE NOTICED THAT HOT AIR WAS COMING FROM THE CENTER DASH VENTS ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT NOT FIXED.    NISSAN IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM WITH THE MESH IN THE VENT SCREEN IN FRONT OF THE WINDSHIELD WHERE FRESH AIR IS INDUCED INTO THE SYSTEM. THE MESH WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW DEBRIS TO ENTER AND ACCUMULATE. THE REMEDY TO THIS PROBLEM ON 2004 MODELS WAS TO MAKE THE MESH IN THE SCREEN VERY FINE. HOWEVER, THE FINER MESH CREATES HIGH RESISTANCE TO THE INDUCTION OF FRESH AIR FROM OUTSIDE THE CAR INTO THE HEATING/VENTILATION SYSTEM. THIS INCREASED RESISTANCE CAUSES THE VENTILATION SYSTEM TO DRAW HEATED, AND POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED AIR, FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. NISSAN?S FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM WAS TO PLACE DUCT TAPE OVER VARIOUS HOLES IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FROM WHERE THE VENTILATION SYSTEM WAS DRAWING AIR. THE DUCT TAPE WAS APPLIED, BUT IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.    I HAVE MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR COMING OUT OF THE 2 CENTER VENTS ON A DAY WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS 78 DEGREES. THE AIR COMING FROM THE VENTS MEASURED 96 DEGREES. LEBLANC NISSAN REPEATED THIS TEST WITH MORE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT AND OBTAINED TEMPERATURES OF ALMOST 100 DEGREES ON A DAY WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS LESS THAN 78 DEGREES.     THE FACT THAT THE TRUCK IS UNCOMFORTABLY HOT OR COLD IS BAD ENOUGH. THE FAR MORE SERIOUS ASPECT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE SYSTEM TO INTRODUCE DEADLY CARBON MONOXIDE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT VIA THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.  *AK",

THE SAME DRIVING PERFORMANCE PROBLEM STILL OCCURRED AND UNUSUALLY AFTER DRIVING VEHICLE 5-10 MILES CONTINUAL DISTANCE. I DRIVE 47 MILES TO WORK DAILY ON INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND AFTER A FEW MILES THIS SHAKING STARTS HAPPENING AT VARING SPEEDS ABOVE 60 MPH. THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO OCCASSIONALLY DART FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHILE TRYING TO TRACK NORMALLY DOWN THE ROAD. DEALER SAYS THE ALINMENT IS NOT OUT. I PIONTED OUT TO THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE BACK RIGHT TIRE WAS IN FACT FEATHERING ON THE OUTSIDE. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO DEALER (LUMBERTON NISSAN) 3 TIMES, AND THE LAST VISIT THEY REMOVED NEWS TIRES WHICH THEY HAD REPLACED- WIHTOUT RESULTS- AND RAN THEM ON A MACHINE AT THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP. THEY DID FIND THAT PARTICULAR TIRE TO BE OUT AND REPLACED IT. THE VEHICLE STILL SHAKES AND HAS A HIGH SPEED VIBRATION. THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE VEHICLES SAFE OPERATION ON THE OPEN HIGHWAY. THE DEALERSHIP DOESN'T WANT TO CONTINUE TRYING TO TRACK DOWN THE PROBLEM OF THE VEHICLE, SO I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN CORP., OFFICES AND FILED A COMPLAINT ON THE VEHICLE AND REQUESTED TODAY TO RETURN THE UNIT TO THE DEALERSHIP. I FEEL THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS VEHICLE IS A SAFETY HAZARD RESULTING FROM A DEFECT IN THE DRIVE TRAIN OF THE VEHICLE. TO AVOID A FOURTH VISIT THE DEALER (WHICH N.C. LEMON LAW STATES) THEY WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO REFUND OR REPLACE THE THE UNIT. I CONTEND TAHT MY V4 FRONTIER TRUCK EITHER HAST A PROBLEM INTERNALLY IN THE DRIVE TRAIN, OR BECAUSE IT IS BUILT ON A LIGHTER FRAME, IT CANNOT PERFORM SAFELY AS MARKETED DUE TO DANGEROUSLY MISS-MATCHED COMPONENT SUSPENSION SYSTEM, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A DESIGN DEFECT ON THE PART OF NISSAN.  *AK",
