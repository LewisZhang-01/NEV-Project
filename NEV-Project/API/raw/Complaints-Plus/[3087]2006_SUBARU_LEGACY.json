I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPORT MY OIL LIGHT WAS FLASHING, AND I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP REP \"TO DRIVE IT IN AND THEY WILL CHECK IT OUT\".

I AGAIN ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG AND WAS TOLD \"THEY PULLED A COUPLE OF CAM TIMING CODES BUT THE CAR WAS OK TO DRIVE\".  THEN 20 MINUTES LATER THE DEALER CALLED ME AND SAID \"WE HAVE TO PUT YOU IN A LOANER CAR BECAUSE WE DROVE YOUR CAR INTO THE SHOP CHECKED YOUR OIL LEVEL WHICH WAS FINE, BUT WHEN WE TESTED YOUR OIL PRESSURE WE FOUND IT TO BE ZERO SO THE CAR IS NOT DRIVABLE, AND IF I DID I WOULD BLOW THE MOTOR\".  I EXPLAINED TO THE REP AGAIN BUT WHAT ABOUT ME BEING TOLD TO DRIVE IT IN HERE.  AGAIN WAS TOLD \"DON'T WORRY YOUR CAR CAN GO SOMETIME WITHOUT OIL BECAUSE OF THE NEW OILS TODAY & THE WAY ENGINES ARE BUILT\".  WITHOUT AN OIL PICKUP TUBE YOUR ENGINE HAS NO OIL PRESSURE, IN SOME SEVERE CASES THE ONLY INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM IS YOUR OIL LIGHT WILL FLASH THEN BOOM YOU BLEW YOUR ENGINE.

THIS PROBLEM IS KNOWN BY SUBARU.  ONE TECH TOLD ME THAT THE ECU NEEDS TO BE REFLASHED, BUT THAT SUBARU HAS NOT COME UP WITH A FLASH TO FIX THE PROBLEM YET.  2) BAD SMELL FROM THE CLUTCH.  HAPPENS MOSTLY IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, BUT OCCURS AT OTHER TIMES TOO.  I'VE HAD IT HAPPENED WHEN I FIRST START THE CAR, AFTER DRIVING IT FOR A LONG TIME, CRUISING ON THE HIGHWAY AND SHIFTING.  IT IS VERY BOTHERSOME.*JB",
