Chevrolet issued a second recall but I never received a notification.  the dealer indicated both recalls were closed and I had to pay $600+ to fix the problem.  I contacted GM Customer Care for assistance but pretty much got the same feedback that the recall was closed and that there was no financial assistance they would provide, 100% of the cost would be my responsibility.  I don't understand how a safety recall can be closed until it is repaired?  I'm not sure why consumers have to pay for a design issue that has the potential of causing an accident due to the potential of the steering column locking up while driving!  I had no choice but to direct the dealer to perform the repairs so I can drive the car with confidents it won't lockup in the future.  Not expecting anything to happen as it seems these types of reported issues fall in favor of businesses and no longer the consumers.  Just wanted to post this complaint out of frustration!",

AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE ONLINE RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT PLAGUES JUST ABOUT EVERY 1997-2004 CHEVROLET CORVETTE EQUIPPED WITH POWER SEATS. I DISCOVERED THAT THE BUSHINGS THAT WERE USED IN THE SEAT TRACKS WERE MADE FROM INFERIOR MATERIALS AND DISINTEGRATE OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND ALLOW THE SEAT TO MOVE IN THE TRACK WHILE TAKING OFF OR STOPPING. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF IF IT WILL HAPPEN BUT WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. TO MY UNDERSTANDING GENERAL MOTORS HAS MADE NO EFFORT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ON THEIR OWN. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME WERE REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY BY REPLACING THE SEAT TRACK BUT THE NEW TRACK WOULD DO THE SAME THING IN TIME. I PURCHASED THIS CAR USED AND WELL OUT OF WARRANTY AND IF IT WERE AN ISOLATED PROBLEM THEN I WOULD ACCEPT THAT AND TRY TO HAVE IT REPAIRED, BUT IT'S NOT. IT HAS HAPPENED TO JUST ABOUT ALL CORVETTES BUILT BETWEEN 1997-2004. IN FACT THERE IS AN AFTERMARKET REPAIR KIT FOR THIS BUT IT REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF THE SEAT AND DISASSEMBLY OF THE SEAT TRACK AND A VERY CAREFUL REASSEMBLY AFTER THE BUSHINGS ARE REPLACED. WE ARE NOT ALL MECHANICS NOR CAN WE ALL AFFORD THE 600.00 PER SEAT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. SOME OF US DO WELL JUST TO BE ABLE TO BUY A CAR LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHY IT'S A 1999 AND NOT A 2015. I LOVE THIS CAR, IT SEEMS A SHAME THAT A CAR THAT COST 40,000.00 WHEN IT WAS NEW SHOULD HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH SLIGHTLY BETTER QUALITY. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. THE PARTS COST FOR G.M. ON THIS REPAIR WOULD NOT BE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR THEM, HOWEVER THE LABOR INVOLVED FOR THEM TO DO THE REPAIRS WOULD PROBABLY BE WHAT THEY WOULD BALK AT. THANK YOU AGAIN.  *TR",

MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALER WANTED ME TO REPLACE THE CAR'S BATTERY, SINCE THAT WAS THE FIRST CODE HE SAW WHEN HE SCANNED THE COMPUTER. NATURALLY, THE CAR DIDN'T NEED A BATTERY SO I DROVE AWAY FROM THE DEALER. THE SYMPTOM WAS AT ANY TIME THE CAR WOULD POP-ON THE ENGINE TROUBLE LIGHT AND IMMEDIATELY SLOW DOWN. THE CAR COULD ONLY BE DRIVEN UP TO 20 MPH. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT SIX TIMES WITHOUT INCIDENT. I COULD RESET MY COMPUTER, BUT THE ISSUE SOON RETURNED.

I MENTIONED TO THE SERVICE WRITER THAT THIS CAR WAS INVOLVED IN A NHTSA RECALL # 04V060000 AND A GM TSB # 01-02-35-008 AND HAD BEEN PERFORMED TWICE SINCE NEW. HE SAID GM WILL ONLY DO RECALL ONCE AND THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR THIS WORK. HE GAVE ME A 800 NUMBER AT GM TO CALL, OF WHICH I DID AND GOT NO SATISFACTION. I THEN AUTHORIZED THE DEALER TO DO THE REPAIR AND PICKED THE CAR UP ON 04/14/08 PAYING THEM $546.99 + AN $85.00 TOW BILL. ON 04/19/08 SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED AFTER PULLING OUT OG MY GARAGE. I PULLED THE KEY WAITED 10 SECONDS AND IT WORKED ON SECOND ATTEMPT. ON 4/21 PROBLEM RECURRED ANY AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR GOING AND DROVE TO THE DEALER AND LEFT THE CAR TO BE CHECKED (7:45 AM). AFTER WAITING A DAY TO HEAR FROM DEALER I VISITED THEM (4/22/08) AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I REQUESTED THEY RELEASE THE CAR TO ME AT THAT POINT, HOWEVER AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS THEY COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO OPERATE. AFTER A WAIT OF 20 MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO DRIVE AND TOOK IT HOME. AT THIS POINT I HAD BEEN ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND AN AFTER MARKET PART CALLED STEERING LOCK SIMULATOR KIT PURCHASED IT AND INSTALLED IT ON 04/24/08. TO DATE 05/07/08 PROBLEM HAS NOT RECURRED AND I'M HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.  MY MAIN CONCERNS ARE:  WHY DIDN'T GM COVER THE COST OF REPAIR ON THIS AS A SAFETY RECALL?  WHY THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIX OR KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM?  I PAID LESS THAN $50.00 FOR THE PART THAT CURED THE PROBLEM!  I HAVE SENT OFF A COMPLAINT LETTER TO CHEVROLET STATING ALL OF THE ABOVE, AND REQUESTED MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY NOT PAY THE DEALER.  SIGNED,  LOU CARDOZA  *TR",

I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WH SAID THER HAD BEEN NO PROBLEMS REPORTED WITH THIS DESIGN.  HE \"LUBED\" THE ASSEMBLIES, WHICH HAD NO EFFECT.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH RESPECT TO THE LOCKING/RATCHETING MECHANISM THET IS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW THE SEAT BELT TO BE LOCKED IN A TIGHT POSITION TO HOLD THE OCCUPANTS IN THE SEATS BETTER FOR HIGH LATERAL FORCES.  UNFORTUNATLY, THE DESIGN OF THE ASSEMBLY FREQUENTLY ALLOWS (AND CAUSES DUE TO RETRACT ANGLES) THE BELT TO FEED INTO THE RETRACTOR FOLDED OVER.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE RETRACT SPRING DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO PULL THE THE BELT ALL OF THE WAY IN, WHICH IT MUST DO TO RELEASE THE RATCHETING MECHANISM.  THE RESULT IS A JAMMED BELT THAT IS PREVENTED FROM BEING PULLED OUT BY THE LOCKING MECHANISM AND PREVENTED FROM RETRACTING FROM THE FOLDED BELT.  SINCE I KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, I AM VERY CAREFULL WHEN TAKING OFF THE BELT, BUT IT STILL HAPPENS OCCASIONALY.  THE PASSENGER SIDE JAMS MUCH MORER FREQUENTLY DUE TO VARYING PEOPLE NOT FAMILIER WITH THE CARE THAT MUST BE TAKEN TO PREVENT A JAM.  I CAN CLEAR THE JAM BY GETTING OUT OF THE CAR, KNEELING ON THE GROUND AND WORKING THE BELT IN AND JERKING OUT UNTIL IT WRAPS ALL OF THE WAY IN TWISTED.  THIS USUALLY TAKES AROUND 20 -  30 MINUTES TO ACCOMPLISH.  I HAVE HAD TO DO THIS AROUND 50 TIMES NOW.  SINCE IT IS ILLEGAL AND UNSAFE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH OUT A SEAT BEALT PROPERLY FASTENED AROUND ALL OCCUPANTS, I AM CONSIDERING HAVING THE VEHICLE TRANSPORTED TO THE DEALER ON A FLATBED EACH TIME IT JAMS.
