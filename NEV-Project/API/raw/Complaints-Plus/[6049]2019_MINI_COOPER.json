        "summary": "Entire Driver Side Tail Lamp assembly stopped working (includes running light, brake light, reverse light, and blinker). Dash board did display warning (while driving) of lights malfunction, but nevertheless stopped working while driving. Upon further Inspection, found a \u201cshort\u201d / melted pig tail (electrical connector) connecting to the rear of the lamp assembly. (Both the connector and pig tail showed signs of melted plastic/fire hazard). After further investigation, I realized this is not an isolated incident as I found multiple threads/posts on the Mini Cooper (F56) Internet forums, in which multiple owners complained of the same issue (many posting pictures as I have), which dates back many years, link to forum attached.  https://www.minif56.com/threads/rear-left-lights-not-working.80537/",

I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SPEED OF THE CAR THEREFORE STARTED TO LOSE SPEED AND DECELERATE. THE VEHICLES BEHIND ME COULD NOT TELL THAT I WAS SUDDENLY LOSING SPEED AND I WAS ALMOST INVOLVING A NEAR FATAL COLLISION AGAIN. I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT 5 -10 MINUTES PRIOR TO THIS PRECIPITOUSLY OCCURRING. THIS WAS THE SAME SITUATION I EXPERIENCED WITH A BRAND NEW MINI COOPER 2019 MODEL A WEEK EARLIER. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY NOTED THAT THE CRANK SHAFT SPEED PULSE GENERATOR SENSOR WAS NO GOOD AND HAD MALFUNCTIONED. AS THIS IS A REPEAT ISSUE AND VERY SERIOUS AS IT ALMOST CAUSED 2 NEAR FATAL INCIDENTS, I AM CONCERNED THAT THE MAKER OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO ENSURE THAT OTHER 2019 MODELS ARE SAFE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD OTHER MINI MODELS WERE HAS EXPERIENCED SAME MALFUNCTION.  THIS INCIDENT AND THE OTHER BOTH OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEED WHICH CREATES A VERY DANGEROUS SET UP AFTER THE VEHICLES HAD BEEN DRIVEN FOR A FEW MILES ON THE HIGHWAY AND IN WET CONDITIONS.",
