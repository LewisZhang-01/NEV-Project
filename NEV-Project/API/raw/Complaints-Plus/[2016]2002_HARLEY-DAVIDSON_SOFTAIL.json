HE PURCHASED  THE MOTORCYCLE  BRAND NEW AND  IN THE WINTER THE GAS TANK  RUSTED  IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS. . HARLEY DAVIDSON PUT A LINER INSIDE THE GAS TANK TO PREVENT IT FROM RUSTING AND IT DID NOT WORK. THE ACTUALLY LINER WAS PEELING AND COMING  OFF  INSIDE THE TANK. IF IT GOT  THROUGH THE FUEL FILTER   INTO  THE CARBURETOR IT WOULD CAUSE THE MOTORCYCLE  TO STALL. THE DEALERSHIP WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE FUEL TANK. CONSUMER CONTACTED HARLEY DAVIDSON  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  SEVERAL TIMES. THEY SUGGESTED THAT CONSUMER  KEEP MORE GAS IN THE GAS TANK  IN THE WINTER. CONSUMER MAINTAINED THAT  HE KEPT THE MOTORCYCLE IN  LIVING ROOM IN THE WINTER AND  THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS PROBLEM. ALSO, COSTUMER SERVICE  SUGGESTED THAT CONSUMER CHANGE THE FUEL TANK, AND CALL  INSURANCE COMPANY TO GET THEM TO PURCHASE  A NEW FUEL TANK. HE HAS ONLY SPOKEN TO ONE PERSON AT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK TO ANYONE ELSE. HE FIRST STARTED NOTICING THE RUST INSIDE THE TANK IN MARCH OF 2005. THE MOTORCYCLE STALLED  THREE TIMES. HE HAD THE MOTORCYCLE TOWED TO THE DEALER, AND THEY CLEANED  THE CARBURETOR, AND THEY TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN. EVERY 2500 MILES CONSUMER TOOK THE MOTORCYCLE TO  DEALER  FOR A TUNE UP. *AK",
