AT THAT POINT BOTH REAR LEAF SPRINGS FAILED AND BLEW APART, DAMAGING THE DRIVE SHAFT AND PULLING THE DRIVE SHAFT FROM THE TRANSFER CASE.  THE REAR AXLE WAS PUSHED TO THE VERY BACK OF THE VEHICLE, MAKING IT UN-DRIVABLE.  THERE WAS ALSO SOME OTHER UNDERSIDE DAMAGE, SUCH AS THE EMERGENCY PARKING BRAKE LINE, SEALS, GASKETS, ETC.  I FILED AN INSURANCE CLAIM, HOWEVER THEY DETERMINED THE ISSUE WAS DUE TO A \"MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE GENERAL MOTORS VEHICLE.\"  I HAVE FULL COVERAGE AND NONE OF THIS WAS COVERED UNDER EITHER COLLISION (I WAS ABLE TO AVOID HITTING ANYTHING) OR COMPREHENSIVE.  REPAIRS FOR ALL THIS ARE $4200 WHICH ARE BEING REPAIRED BY A GM-CERTIFIED MECHANIC AT A GM DEALERSHIP.   I AM NOW OUT $4200 AND HAVE NO RECOURSE WITH GM.

WHEN THE ELECTRICAL PARTS SHORTED OUT THE WIRES WERE BURNT AND WE WERE DRIVING WHEN THIS HAPPENED ON ONE OCCASION AND HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED. WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TAKEN IT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT HELP. THE TRUCK IS ALWAYS DAMP INSIDE. THEN OF COURSE THE SMELL OF THE CARPETS. I EVEN HAVE CONTACTED GM AND JUST SAID TAKE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE GONNA CHARGE THE SAME THING. I AM SCARED FOR MY WIFE AND FAMILY TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK. WE WILL NOT EVEN LEAVE IN THE GARAGE DUE THE RISK OF FIRE. IF YOU GOOGLE THIS PROBLEM THERE IS OVER 60K TOPICS ON THIS AND FORUM AFTER FORUM ABOUT IT. AND EVERY IS SAYING THIS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND GM IS NOT GOING TO STAND BEHIND THIS. I THINK SOMETHING SHOULD DONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE SOMETHING VERY BAD HAPPENS TO SOMEONE IN THESE TRUCKS. I JUST WANT IT FIXED NOTHING ELSE. *TR",

I WAS IN SHOCK THAT I HAD THAT PROBLEM WITH A NEW VEHICLE AND I REQUESTED THAT I GET A NEW REPLACEMENT VEHICLE BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT THE \"LEMON\" THEY SOLD ME WITH A DEFECTIVE ENGINE.  I WAS ASSURED I HAD NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AND THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD BE REPAIRED (UNDER WARRANTY OF COURSE) AND I WOULD NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM AGAIN.  IN NOVEMBER 2010, MONTHS AFTER MY WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, MY VEHICLE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. IN FACT, IT IS AT THE DEALER NOW AND I STILL DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL COST ME TO REPAIR IT.  THE ONLY REASON IT MAY BE REPAIRED AT NO COST TO ME IS BECAUSE I PAID $2650 FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM AN OUTSIDE COMPANY (WHICH EXPIRES SOON).  HOWEVER, MY EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY STILL NEEDS TO DETERMINE IF IT WILL COVER THE REPAIRS. I DID MY RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT MANY (TOO MANY) 2006 H3S HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE AND IT IS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM THAT GM IS VERY AWARE OF.  HOWEVER, DESPITE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS, GM REFUSES TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OR ISSUE ANY BULLETIN.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  IF THE ENGINE MISFIRES AND MY VEHICLE BREAKS DOWN, IT CAN EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND/OR ROLLOVER, AND VERY WELL COST ME MY LIFE AND THE LIVES OF OTHERS.  GM NEEDS TO RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND ISSUE A SAFETY BULLETIN, AND REPLACE ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES.  *TR",

WITH NO WARNING, THE COMPUTER APPLIED THE BRAKES ABRUPTLY AND FIRMLY.  WE WERE IN CITY TRAFFIC AND SPEED WAS SLOW.  MY ONLY SAFETY CONCERN AT THIS TIME WAS THAT WE WOULD BE REAR-ENDED AS WE PROBABLY HAD NO BRAKE LIGHT OPERATION AS THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS NOT USED.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES IN 3-5 MINUTES, WE THEN GOT DASH ERROR CODES AND LIGHTS THAT THE ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEMS HAD FAILED.  THE PROBLEM THEN WENT AWAY AS I ASSUME THE COMPUTER TURNED OFF THESE SYSTEMS SINCE THEY HAD FAILED.  WE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TOWING A SMALL U-HAUL TRAILER AND COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS OCCURRED AT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SPEEDS WITH A TRAILER IN TOW, AND EVEN MORE SCARY IF THE ROAD WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN WET.  WHEN WE GOT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR, THE WARNINGS HAD RESET, AND I ASSUME THE SYSTEMS WERE ACTIVE AGAIN.  LUCKILY AN ERROR CODE WAS STORED.  THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED UNDER WARRANTY AND THE SERVICE RECEIVED WAS SATISFACTORY, BUT I THINK THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW THE COMPUTER TO APPLY THE BRAKES WITH NO WARNING AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  AT THAT TIME, THERE IS NOTHING I AS A DRIVER COULD DO CONCERNING THE BRAKES.  IT SEEMS THERE SHOULD BE A REDUNDANT SYSTEM WHERE THERE MUST BE TWO FEEDBACKS THAT AGREE BEFORE THE SYSTEM APPLIES THE BRAKES, AND IF THE TWO FEEDBACKS DO NOT AGREE THEN THE SYSTEM IS DISABLED AND AN ERROR MESSAGE IS GIVEN.  THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS TO ME TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY FLAW.  THE BAD PART WAS FIXED, BUT I AM NOT SURE I TRUST THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.  THERE WAS ONLY ONE FAILURE.  NO DAMAGE WAS DONE.
