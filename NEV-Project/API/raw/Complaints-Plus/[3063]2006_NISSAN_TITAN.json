I INSPECTED THE UNDERCARRIAGE BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG SO CHECKED TIRE PRESSURES (ALL FINE AT ~34-36PSI).  NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUE, I ASSUMED IT WAS JUST THE WAY WE'D LOADED THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUED DRIVING (WE WERE MORE THAN 6 HRS FROM HOME).  AFTER UNLOADING THE VEHICLE HOWEVER, I REALISED SOMETHING ELSE WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG BECAUSE THE SEVERE LEAN WAS STILL PRESENT.  A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH FOR \"NISSAN TITAN LEANING\" LED ME TO CHECK FOR A BROKEN REAR SHACKLE.      INSPECTING THE FLOOR OF THE BED WAS ENOUGH CONFIRMATION THAT THE LEFT HAND REAR SHACKLE HAD INDEED BROKEN (HUGE BULGE IN THE FLOOR OF THE BED WHERE THE LEAF SPRING SLAMMED UP INTO THE BODY).    NO LESS THAN 26 SEPARATE REPORTS HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE WWW.TITANTALK.COM FORUM ABOUT THE ISSUE (PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE).  I WAS LUCKIER THAN SOME WHERE LEAF SPRINGS BROKE THROUGH THE BED FLOOR COMPLETELY (HAVE PHOTOS TO SUPPORT THIS).    THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE A DEFECT AND INSTEAD QUOTED $480 FOR THE REPAIR.    I HAVE SINCE CONFIRMED THAT NISSAN REINFORCED THE SHACKLES IN 2008 AND SUPERCEDED THE OLDER DESIGN (DAMNING EVIDENCE IN ITSELF).    FOR THE RECORD, THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED WITH MY PREGNANT WIFE, 3 YR OLD SON AND FATHER-IN-LAW AS PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE.  IT IS DAUNTING TO CONSIDER HOW MANY DRIVERS AND FAMILIES ARE AT RISK AS A RESULT OF NISSAN'S FAILURE TO REPORT THIS TO THE NHTSA.

I HAVE ALSO RECENTLY FOUND ONLINE THAT THERE ARE AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF OTHER NISSAN TITAN OWNERS COMPLAINING OF THE SAME THING.

I DECLINED AS I COULD NOT AFFORD REPAIRS LIKE THAT. AFTER A SHORT SEARCH ONLINE I FOUND THAT THIS WAS A REGULAR ISSUE WITH TITANS BUT WAS NOT SUBMITTED FOR A RECALL. I HAVE ALSO SENT A COMPLAINT TO NISSAN. I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS THE LACK OF SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE DEALER. MY FAMILY AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRONG SUPPORTERS OF NISSAN AND OWN MANY OF THEIR VEHICLES AND HAVE NEVER HAD ISSUES LIKE THIS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE RESOLVED. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY NISSANS BUT HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE REVIEWED AND CLAIMED AS A RECALL. I CANNOT AFFORD THE REPAIRS AS MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED WITH 4 CHILDREN AND THIS IS OUR ONLY VEHICLE WHICH WE CAN NO LONGER DRIVE BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE IT SMOGGED TO RENEW REGISTRATION.   THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE MANIFOLDS HAD BEEN CRACKED FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE VISIT TO THE DEALER. WE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN OUR TRUCK TO THE DEALER BECAUSE WE HAD PURCHASED A GOLD PACKAGE FOR MAINTENANCE AND I HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT NOISE BEFORE AND THEY COULD NEVER FIND A PROBLEM. IT FIGURES THAT AS SOON AS IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY THEY WOULD MAGICALLY FIND THE ISSUE. *TR",

A FEW DAYS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT MY TRUCK STARTED DRIVING WEIRD AND DISENGAGING ITSELF OUT OF 4WD AND I WOULD LOSE CONTROL AT TIMES OR MY TRUCK WOULD STOP GOING FORWARD AND WOULD START TRYING TO GO SIDEWAYS, BUT THE RPM'S STILL WENT UP, BUT TRUCK WOULD NOT ACCEL FORWARD. IT ALSO STARTED MAKING A BANGING NOISE IN THE REAR, ALWAYS SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS THE PASSENGER SIDE. DROPPED IT OFF AT DEALERSHIP AND HEARD FROM THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY. SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT MY REAR BRAKE SHOES HAD BROKE AND SPUN AROUND IN THE BRAKE HOUSING AND DAMAGED MY BRAKE PADS, CALIPERS, ROTORS AND THEN MADE IT INTO MY REAR AXLE HOUSING AND DAMAGED MY ENTIRE REAR HOUSING AND DIFFERENTIAL. I AM A MECHANIC MYSELF AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT PIECES FROM THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT INSIDE AN ENCLOSED REAR HOUSING ASSEMBLY. THEY TOLD ME I NEED MY ENTIRE REAR AXLE AND DIFFERENTIAL REPLACED ALONG WITH OTHER PIECES FOR THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY AND REAR SHOCK ABSORBERS.

THEY ARE QUOTING ME $4,200 FOR THE REPAIRS AND WON'T COVER ME UNDER MY POWERTRAIN WARRANTY EVEN THOUGH I AM STILL UNDER 60,000 MILES AND I CAN'T BE COVERED BY MY PLATINUM PACKAGE EXTENDED WARRANTY AS WELL WHICH COVERS ME UP TO 100,000 MILES.

WHEN THE VEHICLE RAN INTO THE RUT IN THE ROAD IT TILTED VERY SLIGHTLY AND THEN RIGHTED ITSELF.  THERE WAS NO EXTERIOR DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO THE PEOPLE RIDING IN THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE WAS THEN DRIVEN TO THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY CONTACTED NISSAN WHO SAID THAT THE AIRBAGS HAD DEPLOYED PROPERLY AND THEY WOULD NOT PAY ANY PART OF REPLACING THEM OR THE SEAT BELTS.  THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE ALSO SAID THAT THE VEHICLES' COMPUTER SENT OUT AN 'ERROR CODE' THAT THE VEHICLE HAD ROLLED OVER.  ALSO, WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH ANOTHER NISSAN TRAINED AND CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN, WE WERE TOLD THAT 7 OUT OF 10 TITANS HAVE ISSUES WITH THEIR COMPUTERS AND THAT THE SENSOR UNDER THE VEHICLE IS PRONE TO COME LOOSE.  IT DOESN'T SEEM LOGICAL THAT A MINOR INCIDENT LIKE THIS COULD CAUSE THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY AND HAVE TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH THE SEAT BELTS UNLESS THE SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE WAS DEFECTIVE.  IT COST MORE THAN $5,000 TO REPLACE THE AIRBAGS AND THE SEAT BELTS AND NISSAN WOULD NOT PAY ANY OF THIS AMOUNT. *TR",

NOW THERE SOLUTION IS TO INSTALL A SPECIAL PROTECTOR KIT TO ELIMINATE A POTENTIAL FIRE TO OCCUR.

THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE THESE WARRANTY REPLACEMENTS. I WAS REASSURED THAT MY NORMAL DRIVING DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEMS.    REAR AXLE REPLACEMENT - 15800 MILES. THIS WAS ALSO NOT DUE TO MY NORMAL DRIVING, AS REASSURED BY THE NISSAN SERVICE STATION. I WAS LITERALLY SHAKEN OFF THE ROAD. THE TRUCK HAD TO BE TOWED BACK TO THE SERVICE STATION, AFTER THEY TOLD ME THAT THE VIBRATION I FELT WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SOME TIRE CUPPING WHEN I HAD BROUGHT IT IN THE DAY BEFORE.    THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WAS JERKING AND RUNNING AT HIGHER THAN NORMAL RPM IN IDLE AND REVERSE. NEW TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AT 15800 MILES ALSO.    ALL THE BRAKES WERE REPLACED MERELY 1 WEEK AFTER MY NEW TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY AND REAR END WERE REPLACED. I HAD DRIVEN ALMOST 600 MILES.    I AM NOW DRIVING A RENTAL CAR, PAYING OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE I AM TOO SCARED TO LOSE CONTROL OF A CAR THAT MIGHT HAVE A TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE CAUSING HARM TO MYSELF OR OTHER DRIVERS/PEDESTRIANS. I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW IN MARCH 2006; WITH 6 MILES ON IT. *JB",

MY 2006 NISSAN TITAN'S AIR CONDITIONING/HEATING CONTROLS RESPONSE TO CHANGE IS SLOW WITH HEADLIGHTS ON (10-15 SECONDS TO MOVE FROM FLOOR TO DEFROST), CAUSING A SAFETY PROBLEM WHEN NEEDING TO DEFROST AT NIGHT. NISSAN INDICATED THIS SAFETY PROBLEM IS THE RESULT OF POOR DESIGN FOR TITANS SINCE THE ENGINEERS CHOSE TO USE THE VARIABLE VOLTAGE FROM THE INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHT RHEOSTAT TO POWER THE HVAC CONTROLS. THIS 15 SECOND DELAY CAUSES A SAFETY PROBLEM SINCE WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT SINCE THE DRIVER MAY BE UNAWARE THAT THE WINDSHIELD IS FOGGED UNTIL ONCOMING TRAFFIC COMES INTO VIEW. WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN MODES (IN THIS CASE, HEAT TO DEFROST), BY THE TIME AIR BEGINS TO BLOW OVER THE WINDSHIELD, THE TRUCK HAS TRAVELED 1100 FEET WITHOUT ME BEING ABLE TO SEE THE ROAD (AT 50 MPH). THIS HAS MADE ME RUN OFF THE ROAD, OR NEARLY RUN OFF THE ROAD, NUMEROUS TIMES (AT LEAST 10 THAT I REMEMBER). THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO TURN THE INSTRUMENT PANELS TO FULL BRIGHT WHICH BLINDS ME DURING NIGHTTIME DRIVING (JUST AS UNACCEPTABLE AS A FOGGED WINDSHIELD).
