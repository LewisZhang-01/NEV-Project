        "summary": "I purchased a 2014 Mazda CX-9 on 12/14/2019. On Monday 10/18/2021 I was driving on the Hwy on the way home and my check engine light came. I had my mechanic check it out and he said the computer read a P0019 code. So on 10/20/2021, I took it to the dealer where I originally purchased it and this was the same code they found.  At the local dealership, I was told that apparently, the water pump needed to be replaced due to water coolant in the oil pan. I had absolutely no warning. No leaking, no smell of coolant. This vehicle only has 88,000. Upon further research and to my surprise is that the water pump in the Duratec 37 engine and make and model has a design flaw with the water pump located in the engine with the timing chain.  That is the number one problem that fails first due to the water pump gaskets wearing degrading without any warning pump has become damaged due to pump bearings too.  I had my vehicle serviced with four oil changes over the past 28,000 miles since I purchased it.  These late-model vehicles being built today I know do not burn that much oil nowadays. I also found out, the iVCT 3.7 Duratec is in the 2008-2015 Mazda CX-9 which I have the 2014 model.  This 3.7 V6 uses a timing chain-driven water pump. I also found out this kind of water pump is prone to failing at the pump bearings which allows the timing center to move around. Once it\u2019s bad enough coolant is dumped into the engine where it mixes with the oil dripping from the water pump into the oil pan. This is where the real problems begin. Coolant mixing with oil is not good. It can cause corrosion and lots of internal wear as the Duratec 3.7  engine oil is no longer able to properly lubricate moving parts and shut down the engine. Base on the number of oil changes I had during this time I'm sure it had nothing to do with the water pump failure issue. This is solely a Mazda manufacturing flaw with the design.  At this time my warranty does not want to cover the repair. Thanks",

THIS IS NOT ONLY ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SAME PROBLEM NOW EXISTING IN 2014 MAZDA CX-9'S WITH A POWER BOOSTER MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE FEBRUARY 2013 FAULTY BOOSTER MOLD CORRECTION, IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE FOR MAZDA TO REFUSE THE REPAIR.
