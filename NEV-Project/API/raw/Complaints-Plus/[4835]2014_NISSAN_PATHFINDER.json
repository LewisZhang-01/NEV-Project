I took my car to a Nissan dealership on May 2020 and they were not able to diagnose the problem.  They recommended to replace the transmission but did not guarantee that will solve the issue.  The problem got worse making my car very unsafe to drive and I took it to a different dealership on July of 2021 where they told me that I need to replace my transmission and they indicated that this would solve the issue.  I went ahead with the repair which costed me close to $6K.  Now I receive the recall notice describing exactly the problems that I was having.  Nissan should've been open about this recall and not make me spend thousands to solve an issue that was caused by them.",

Michael D. Riffe at phone number 214 390 5370 or 469 877 0690 was my service  agent., after inspecting the car, he told me that the transmission is bad again and I need to pay approx. $5900 before tax and labor.  I reminded him that they had just changed the transmission in 2017 so I didn't understand why the 2nd transmission went bad again, he refused to help repair/replace the transmission even though they claimed to have installed a new transmission in 2017. Michael told me since I had added  miles on the car they can't replace the transmission and I will need to pay approx. $5900 before tax for it to be replaced.  Nissan of McKinney is deceptive, I feel like I was robbed and Nissan of McKinney lied in 2017 when they claimed that they had replaced the transmission because a transmission does not just break and they never showed me proof that they had installed a new transmission. I am requesting for assist so Nissan of McKinney/Nissan can take full responsibility and repair/replace the transmission at no charge.  Also, after a research I found similar SUVs had transmission issues and there was a lawsuit filed in which Nissan accepted to settle, I was never made aware of this lawsuit and my vehicle is one of the affected vehicles in the lawsuit.",

I had not received notice for this recall but east Charlotte Nissan insisted it get done.  Until this date I had NO problems with this vehicle.  Right after the recall was done I was driving thru a round-a-bout, tapped the brakes and then had NO Acceleration.  There was a semi-truck on my bumper and I had no where to go.  I immediately brought the vehicle back to EC and they insisted it was my transmission.  They said they found no issues and charged me for work that was not necessary.  I continued to brake down 4 more times pulling my trailer from NC to ME. Two incidents were on I81N.  I had semi-trucks all around me.  Panicked!! I had the vehicle into 4 different dealers, 6 different times.  They could not fix the issue.    I asked Berlin City Nissan to at least replace the recall parts.  They did.  My vehicle totally broke down this time, again going thru a round-a-bout.  Every light on the dash was flashing.  I had no control of the vehicle but was able to roll onto the sidewalk.  I was too afraid to drive this vehicle any further.  I called a tow truck.   Several dealers explained they had seen this already and thought they could repair.  None Could.  Marc Motors sent that vehicle off to auction, as is!!!  I have nightmares of some mom breaking down with her kids in the car.  I have filed complaints with Nissan, 10 different departments.  Nissan Corporate is telling me the NHTSA is responsible for the Nightmare Nissan has caused me and have 'brushed me off'.  I am now in a 2022 Nissan Pathfinder and have identified 3 different issues with the vehicle.  One of which is very dangerous.  Not sure where to go next.  I have all the documentation to back up my claim.  Can you help?",

THERE ARE NO SENSORS OR FEEDBACK MONITORING OF THE REAR BLOWER MOTOR TO CONFIRM IT IS OPERATIONAL.

FROM THE INFORMATION I GATHERED, THEY WILL NOT HELP IN REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION UNLESS YOU HAVE SPENT A BOATLOAD OF MONEY AT THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER. I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE, SAME THING HAPPENED TO TRANS, NISSAN PAID FOR 70% OF TRANSMISSION REPAIR. I LEARNED THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SPENT THOUSANDS AT THE SERVICE CENTER ON OTHER REPAIRS AND HE WAS APPROVED. I ARGUED WITH NISSAN THAT I AM BEING PENALIZED FOR HAVING A CAR THAT WORKED WELL AND DID NOT HAVE A BUNCH OF REPAIRS.

THE INSIDE PORTION OF THE VISOR ITSELF WAS OBVIOUSLY POORLY ENGINEERED AND LOOSENED/CRACKED INSIDE THE VISOR WHICH HOLDS IT SECURE TO THE VISOR ARM. THE VISOR WOULD NOT REMAIN IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION, OUT OF THE FIELD OF VISION WHILE DRIVING. IT WAS CAUGHT IN A STATE OF LIMBO IN BETWEEN BEING ALL THE WAY DOWN, AND BEING ALL THE WAY UP. AS A TEMPORARY FIX, I HAD IT SECURED WITH VELCRO, BUT THIS WOULD COME LOOSE SOMETIMES WHILE DRIVING AND OBSTRUCT MY VISION.

I SECURED BOTH VISORS IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION WITH BUNGEE CORDS AS THE VELCRO WASN'T SECURE.

I CONTACTED NISSAN'S CORPORATE OFFICE TO SEE IF THEY COULD RESOLVE THIS FOR ME SINCE IT HAS BEEN A COMMON COMPLAINT AMONG PATHFINDER OWNERS, BUT I WAS GIVEN THE SAME ANSWER.

I HAVE REPLACED THE TIRES, BRAKES, AND ROTORS SEVERAL TIMES AT THE ADVICE OF THE DEALER. NONE OF THAT FIXED THE SHUDDER.     NISSAN HAD A RECALL FOR  A DEFECTIVE VALVE BODY IN THE TRANSMISSION. THE VALVE BODY WAS REPLACED ON BOTH VEHICLES; HOWEVER, THE FAILURE WAS NOT CORRECTED. BANISTER NISSAN OF CHESAPEAKE DID NOT INFORMED ME UNTIL AFTER THE PATHFINDER WAS OUT OF WARRANTY THAT TRANSMISSION WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEMS AND  WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. I REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM THE NISSAN MANUFACTURER AS ADVISED BY THE DEALERSHIP SINCE I HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS FOR SO LONG.      THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. NISSAN AGREED TO PAY FOR REPAIR COSTS FOR THE VEHICLE. BANISTER NISSAN OF CHESAPEAKE NOW TELLS ME THEY WILL NEED TO DO ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST BUT REFUSE TO COVER ANY COST ASSOCIATED.  THE ADVISORS STATED THAT DIAGNOSTIC COULD COAST ANYWHERE FROM $200 - $800.    MY HUSBAND AND I ARE EXPERIENCING MOST OF THE SAME ISSUES WITH THE 2014 NISSAN ROGUE PURCHASED NEW AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP.",

WHATEVER MIGHT THE REASON BE, NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THEM TO FIX IT.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE...PLEASE INVESTIGATE!!!",

THE CAR WAS HAVING TRANSMISSION ISSUES BACK BEFORE IT MADE IT TO 30,000 MILES AND NOW AT 55,000 MILES THE SUV IS HAVING MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE BUT NISSAN REFUSES TO FIX. NISSAN INSTEAD PUTS THIS SUV BACK ON THE ROAD KNOWING IT IS HAVING A SAFETY ISSUE FOR ACCELERATION AND PASSENGER SIDE AIR-BAG AND PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK. I AM REQUESTING NISSAN TO DO A BUY BACK OF THIS SUV. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT WITH ANOTHER FAULTY TRANSMISSION OR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION. I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN FLORIDA WITH PEOPLE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. SO OBLIVIOUSLY THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS.",

THE SIDE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED WHEN THE IMPACT WAS FRONT/BACK.  NEITHER THE DRIVER OR THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.  I HAD A LOT OF BRUISING FROM THE SEAT BELT & MY HUSBAND HAD A HEAD RELATED INJURY LIKE A CONCUSSION DUE TO THE IMPACT AS WELL AS US BOTH HAVING BACK PAIN ISSUES.  I FEEL THAT IF I HADN'T BEEN WEARING MY SEAT BELT SEEING HOW BADLY I WAS BRUISED & A KNOT IN MY BREAST FROM THE IMPACT THAT I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY HIT THE WINDSHIELD OR WORSE.  I WAS IN A MUCH LESS SEVERE ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS A CHILD & HIT MY HEAD ON THE WINDSHIELD.  THAT IS WHY I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT IF I HADN'T BEEN WEARING MY SEAT BELT, IT FAILED,ETC THAT I WOULD HAVE HIT THE WINDSHIELD.  I HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT SEAT BELTS WERE.     WE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THE FRONT AIRBAGS (BOTH PASSENGER AND DRIVER) DIDN'T DEPLOY CONSIDERING THE IMPACT WAS FROM THE REAR AND FRONT.  NOW THAT THERE IS A RECALL, IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.  THE SIDE PASSENGER AIRBAGS DID DEPLOY, BUT NOT THE FRONT PASSENGER... OR DRIVER FOR THAT MATTER.      WE WERE COMPLETELY STOPPED IN A TUNNEL DUE TO A QUICK TRAFFIC PROBLEM WHEN THE CAR BEHIND US HIT US.  THE IMPACT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO PUSH US INTO THE STOPPED CAR IN FRONT OF US.  THEY HAD TO CLOSE THE TUNNEL DOWN TO TOW OUR CAR AS WELL AS THE CAR BEHIND US OUT OF THE TUNNEL.  2 OF 3 CARS WERE NOT DRIVE-ABLE AND OUR CAR WAS TOTALED.  I AM SURE THE CAR BEHIND US WAS TOTALED ALSO.    WE ENDED UP GETTING A 2015 NISSAN PATHFINDER - BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE SAFEST OPTIONS - & NOW THERE IS A RECALL ON THOSE AIRBAGS BUT THE PARTS AREN'T AVAILABLE.  SO THIS IS VERY CONCERNING...      PHOTOS ATTACHED ARE OF THE SIDE AIRBAGS THAT DEPLOYED.  AT LEAST 2 INJURIES +.",

SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR, I HAVE REPLACED THE TIRES 2 TIMES AT THE ADVICE OF THE DEALER (YES, THEY TRIED TO BLAME IT ON THE TIRES) AND HAVE HAD THE BRAKES REPLACED AT THEIR ADVICE. NONE OF THAT FIXED THE SHUDDER. I'VE SPENT A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS PROVING THAT. LAST WEEK IT WAS AT THE DEALER FOR 4 DAYS, AND THEY ADMITTED THERE IS STILL A SHUDDER, WHICH IS CONSTANT AND GETS WORSE WHEN GOING UPHILL, BUT SAID IT IS BECAUSE MY TIRES ARE \"SQUARE\". BRAND NEW TIRES THEY JUST TALKED ME INTO BUYING. THEY TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING MORE THEY WILL DO AND ASKED ME TO COME GET MY VEHICLE . THIS IS THE FOURTH DEALERSHIP MY CAR HAS BEEN TO. I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AND NOT 2 BLOCKS DOWN THE ROAD AT ABOUT 10 MPH IT STARTED VIOLENTLY JERKING AND NO AMOUNT OF GAS WOULD MAKE IT GO. IT STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, WITH MY BABY IN THE BACK SEAT. IT DID THE SAME THING SEVERAL MORE TIMES ON THE WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEIR MECHANIC DROVE IT AND AGAIN, IT IMMEDIATELY JERKED VIOLENTLY AS HE FIRST PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL- HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE IT STALL (OR SAID HE DIDN'T ).  NOW THEY ADMIT IT IS NOT TIRES AND SAID THEY NEED THE COMPUTER TO VERIFY THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY WON'T FIX IT UNLESS THE COMPUTER SAYS THERE IS AN ISSUE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT DRIVABLE. NISSAN CORPORATE CALLED ME TODAY TO SAY THE COMPUTER SAYS THERE IS NO ISSUE AND TOLD ME I HAVE TO RETURN THE LOANER CAR AND PICK MY BROKEN DOWN PATHFINDER BACK UP. NO REPAIR WILL BE PERFORMED, SINCE THE \"COMPUTER\" ISN'T GETTING A FAULT CODE. SO I AM STUCK WITH A $40,000 HUNK OF JUNK THAT I CAN'T DRIVE OR EVEN SELL.

I DECLINED BECAUSE THIS SHOULD FALL UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY AND PROCEEDED TO CALL NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS HOTLINE TO OPEN CASE ABOUT ISSUES.

I HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO EAST CHARLOTTE NISSAN SINCE OCTOBER, WHERE AT FIRST I WAS TOLD IT WAS A RECALL. WELL, ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL,SAID IT WAS NOT SHOWING UP AS A RECALL AT THAT TIME. I TOOK IT BACK IN DECEMBER, BUT THE CAR STILL DID NOT HAVE A RECALL. AS THE PROBLEM PERSISTED, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS GIVEN AN UPDATE AND THAT IF IT CONTINUED TO BRING IT BACK BECAUSE NISSAN REQUIRES THEM TO GO THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS BEFORE REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION. WELL THIS PAST WEEK (JUNE 15-21), IT HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE. IN ADDITION TO THE SHUDDERING, HESITATION, AND VIBRATION WHILE ACCELERATING, THE VEHICLE HAS BEGUN ALMOST ACTING LIKE IT WAS TO STALL WHILE DECELERATING.

GIVING AND HOLDING FULL THROTTLE. MY UNEDUCATED OPINION IS THAT THIS IS A SOFTWARE GLITCH FOR THE CVT. I THINK THAT THE TRANSMISSION ASSUMES THAT THERE IS WHEEL SPIN UPON ACCELERATION (ALTHOUGH THERE IS NONE) AND THE ANTI-SKID SOFTWARE REDUCES ENGINE POWER TO PREVENT WHEEL SPIN. THIS HAS PUT ME IN LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS. I REPORTED IT TO NISSAN AT THE FIRST COMPLIMENTARY OIL CHANGE AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP (NOT WHERE WE PURCHASED IT) AND THEY RAN A DYNAMOMETER DIAGNOSTICS ON THE CAR AND SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.

I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THE SERVICE CENTER IN EXCESS OF 5 TIMES OVER THE COURSE THAT I HAVE HAD THE CAR (PURCHASED IN OCTOBER 2013) FOR THE AIR BAG LIGHT ISSUE. WHEN A PASSENGER SITS IN THE SEAT, THE AIR BAG OFF LIGHT MAY STAY ON DURING THE COURSE OF THE DRIVE, INDICATING THAT THE AIR BAG IS TURNED OFF. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY TIME A PASSENGER IS IN THE SEAT AND ONLY AT RANDOM TIMES. THE SERVICE CENTER HAS UPDATED THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NISSAN PATHFINDER RECALL AGAINST THE AIRBAG ISSUE. THE SERVICE CENTER HAS ALSO REPLACED THE AIR BAG SENSOR. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, NONE OF THESE \"FIXES\" HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE. I HAVE COME TO FIND THAT IT MAY BE A PROGRAMMING ISSUE WITH THE AIR BAG -- IF A PASSENGER IS NOT FULLY SEATED AND STILL AT THE MOMENT THE CAR IS TURNED ON, THE SENSOR WILL NOT PROPERLY REGISTER THE PASSENGER WEIGHT. TYPICALLY, WHEN THE WEIGHT IS UNDETERMINED OR CANNOT BE IMMEDIATELY READ, THE CAR WILL KEEP THE AIR BAG OFF LIGHT ON ASSUMING THAT IT FALLS OUTSIDE OF THE \"ADULT WEIGHT\" CATEGORY. THE LIGHT WILL REMAIN ON FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 10 MINUTES OF DRIVING WHEN IT FINALLY RE-REGISTERS THE PASSENGER WEIGHT. THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS CAN BE CHARACTERIZED IN MULTIPLE WAYS -- CAR TURNS ON AND PASSENGER IS STILL GETTING IN SEAT; PASSENGER SITS DOWN AS THE CAR IS TURNING ON; PASSENGER IS FULLY SEATED BUT SLIGHTLY MOVES DURING THE WEIGHT REGISTRATION; ETC. REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION, WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE DRIVER CAN DRIVE FOR A NUMBER OF MILES WITH NO AIR BAG UNTIL THE SENSOR RE-REGISTERS THE PASSENGER WEIGHT AND REALIZE AN ADULT IS IN THE SEAT. NISSAN'S PROGRAMMING OF THE AIR-BAG SENSOR IS NOT WITHIN THE FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR AIR BAG SAFETY. I REQUEST THAT THE NHTSA PLEASE REVIEW NISSAN'S AIR BAG PROGRAMMING AND VALIDATE SAFETY.  *TR",
