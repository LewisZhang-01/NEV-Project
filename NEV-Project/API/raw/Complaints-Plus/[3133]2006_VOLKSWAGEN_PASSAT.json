SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR TO DRIVE MY CAR EACH TIME I GET INTO IT I THINK OF HOW RISKY IT IS TO DRIVE EACH TIME. I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF DRIVERS THROATS BEING SLIT BY THE UNSAFE METAL SHARDS THAT DEPLOY WITH THE RECALLED AIRBAGS. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THERE IS STILL NOT A FIX OR MEANS FOR DRIVERS TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE A CAR THAT IS SAFE. I THINK THAT IT IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND TOO RISKY TO HAVE ONE OF THE MAIN SAFETY MECHANISM IN CAR TO BE A THREAT TO DRIVERS AS WELL. WHEN THERE ARE RECALLS ON TOYS PEOPLE ARE INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RETURN THEM TO THE STORE OR AT LEAST THROW THEM AWAY AND KEEP THE TOYS AWAY FROM THEIR CHILDREN. NOW THERE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE WITH AIRBAGS IN A CAR AND NOT HIS HAS BEEN DONE. PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF THE FAULTY AIR BAGS AND STILL NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.

COULD NOT AFFORD AT THAT TIME AND WAS NOT INFORMED IT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS OFF AND WERE TOLD THAT UPON ACCELERATION FROM STOP THE METALS WOULD SCRAPE. CAR WAS STILL OPERABLE, C/E LIGHT WAS OFF  AND NEEDED FOR TRANSPORTATION TO WORK AND AFTER 3 TRIPS TO AND FROM REPAIR SHOP (3 RIVERS VOLKSWAGEN) AND ALL OF THE MONEY ALREADY SPENT ON REPAIRS TO \"FIX\" THE SAME ISSUE LEADING UP TO THIS, I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT AT THE TIME, AS WELL AS BEING SKEPTICAL OF PAYING $9K MORE! WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE OIL PUMP BOLT FAILED COMPLETELY AND CAUSED ENGINE TO CEASE. LATER LEARNED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON ISSUE ON THE 2006 VW PASSAT 2.0T ENGINES AND THAT IT CAN CAUSE CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE, THAT VW WAS AWARE OF THE DESIGN FLAW AND HAS MANUFACTURED A REPLACEMENT BOLT BUT HAS NEVER ISSUED A RECALL AND DOES NOT INFORM OWNERS OF THESE CARS THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THIS ENGINE FAILURE. HTTP://WWW.FAQS.ORG/CAR/VOLKSWAGEN-PASSAT-2006/ENGINE/#IXZZ2MCKGQSG2  I WAS LUCKY NOT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AS THE ENGINE FAILED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, AND HAD TO GET A TOW HOME. THIS IS A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN FOR MANY LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE NEVER TOLD THE ENGINE MAY CEASE AND COULD RESULT IN PEOPLE BEING INJURED OR KILLED. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THIS AS THERE ARE MANY OTHERS HAVING THIS EXACT ISSUE ON THIS CAR.  *TR",

AFTER HEARING THAT GOOD NEWS, TOWED VEHICLE TO LOCAL VW PRO WHO ALSO DIAGNOSED \"TIMING CHAIN ISSUE\", AND WAS GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD TO FIX.  PROBLEM ISOLATED TO INTERMEDIATE SHAFT BOLT, WHICH HAD BACKED OUT, ALLOWING TIMING SPROCKETS TO WANDER.  BOLT ITSELF IS NEARLY SHEARED IN HALF - GOOD THING WE STOPPED WHEN WE DID.  BOLT WAS ALSO RUBBING ON TIMING CHAIN COVER, AND WOULD HAVE LIKELY BROKE OR GROUND THRU TIMING CHAIN COVER.  THIS PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED BY MY LOCAL VW GUY FOR $3300, WHICH INCLUDED ALL OEM PARTS, NEW WATER PUMP, PLUS PLUGS.    IMHO, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR OWNERS WHICH MAY EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM.  MINIMAL RESEARCH ON THE WEB INDICATES I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE.

AS I WRITE THIS, THE CAR IS IMMOBOLIZED IN MY GARAGE AND WILL NOT START, I HAVE MISSED APPOINTMENTS OVER AND OVER. I WENT ON HTTP://FORUMS.VWVORTEX.COM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?3656214 TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW TO CORRECT THIS AND FOUND OUT THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAS OR HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THEIR VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT AND THE SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN. I DO NOT HAVE ANY MONEY TO PAY FOR SUCH A BIG JOB, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE NOT HAD THIS CAR FOR SIX MONTHS. THIS CAR WAS SOLD WITH THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE DESCRIPTION BELOW IS A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PROBLEM AND HOW IT PROGRESSED TO THE CURRENT STATE.     I FIRST NOTICED THE ISSUE AROUND 8000 MILES OR SO WHERE THE KEY FOB WOULD GET STUCK IN THE IGNITION.  AFTER READING SOME POSTS ON VWFORUM, I WORKED AROUND THE INTERMITTENT ISSUE BY CLICKING THE GEAR SHIFT 3 TIMES TO DISENGAGE THE KEY FOB FROM THE IGNITION.  AROUND 24K MILE OR SO, I NOTICED THE STALLING ISSUE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CAR WAS STARTED.  THIS PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT AS WELL AND SEEMED TO OCCUR DURING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS - COLD OR HOT.  AT THIS TIME, THE ERROR 'STEERING COLUMN FAILURE' WOULD REGISTER INTERMITTENTLY.  AROUND 60K THE PROBLEM PROGRESSED AND THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE INCREASED.  I REPORTED THE ISSUE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE.  LOOKING BACK AT THE MULTIPLE BLOGS AND FORUMS ON THIS TOPIC, I BELIEVE THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE ISSUE THAT FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE PROBLEM WOULD HAVE BEEN WARRANTED.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE WIDESPREAD ISSUE AT THE TIME AND DID NOT INSIST ON HAVING THE DEALER RESEARCH THE ISSUE WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL IN WARRANTY.  THE INSPECTION FEE WAS ENOUGH TO DETER ME FROM PUSHING FURTHER SPECIALLY IF THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED.  CURRENTLY, AT 88K MILES, THE PROBLEM OF STALLING WHEN STARTING CAN BE REPRODUCED AT WILL.  THERE IS A WORKAROUND POSTED ON THE SAME VW FORUMS OF SPECIFIC STEPS TO START THE CAR THAT I'M CURRENTLY USING.  OTHERWISE, THE CAR DOES NOT START AND THE ERRORS 'STEERING COLUMN FAILURE 'IMMOBILZER DEFECTIVE' IS DISPLAYED CONSISTENTLY.  WE ALSO EXPERIENCED TWO INSTANCES OF THE CAR STALLING WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY.  I BELIEVE THIS IS CAUSED BY THE SAME IMMOBILIZER ERROR CAUSED BY THE STEERING COLUMN FAILURE AS THE TWO ERRORS DISPLAYED WHEN TRYING TO RESTART.  THIS IS A SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING ISSUE. *TR",

ON DEC 27 2008, I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY APROX 60MPH AND THE ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE WAS ENGAGED INSTANTLY WITHOUT WARNING AND CAUSE ME TO LOOSE CONTROL OF VEHICLE, SPIN 180 AND I GOT HIT BY AN SUV DRIVING BEHIND ME ON THE SAME DIRECTIONAL LANE. AFTER THE INCIDENT I TRY TO MOVE THE VEHICLE FROM THE TRAVEL LANE BUT THE WHEELS WERE STILL LOCKED. AFTER TRYING TO DISENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE SEVERAL TIMES I DRAGGED THE VEHICLE OF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN OFF THE ENGINE. AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES TO DISENGAGE THE PARKING I WAS ABLE TO DO IT AND LEAVE THE SCENE DRIVING ON THE SHOULDER UNTIL I EXIT THE HIGHWAY. THE VEHICLE THAT HIT ME LEFT AND BECAUSE I HAD MINOR DAMAGES AND I DECIDE NOT TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE AUTHORITIES. IMMEDIATELY I CONTACT THE LOCAL DEALER AND VW OF AMERICA AND INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE SITUATION AND OPEN UP A CASE #80411298. I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DEALER LOCATED IN NAPERVILLE IL AND AFTER 7 DAYS THE TECHNICIAN SAID: WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ENGAGED AT THE HIGHWAY SPEED. AFTER DOING A RESEARCH ON VW FORUM CALLED VW VORTEX, WWW.VWVORTEX.COM, I FOUND OUT THE  SAME THING HAPPEN TO OTHER VW PASSAT OWNERS. THE REASON I'M WRITING YOU IS BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE HERE AND I SHOULD SAY I WAS VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I DID NOT GET HIT BY A HEAVY TRUCK, I DID NOT GET INJURED OR MAYBE KILLED. AS OF TODAY THE LOCAL DEALER DON'T KNOW WHAT TO FIX ON THIS VEHICLE AND THEY WANT ME TO PICK UP THE CAR BECAUSE THEY SAID IT?S SAFE TO DRIVE. I THINK YOU SHOULD INTERVENE AND ANALYZE THIS ISSUE AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION QUICK BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR MAYBE KILLED. PLEASE FELL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON MY EMAIL ADDRESS OR MY PHONE NUMBER AT ANYTIME I CAN ASSIST WITH MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. *TR",

MEANS NOTHING I GUESS...AND THEY'VE ROAD TESTED IT AGAIN. BY THE WAY, HAD MY WIFE FLOORED THE GAS, WITH THE 2.0T ENGINE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE.

THE PEDAL WAS VERY HARD -- I COULD BARELY PUSH IT IN WITH TWO FEET.   I ACTIVATED THE PARKING BRAKE, AND THE CAR STOPPED -- THANK GOD, I WAS ONLY GOING 10 MPH, BUT IF I ROLLED INTO THE INTERSECTION I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.   WHEN THE CAR STOPPED, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, THE ENGINE BEGAN REVVING UP AND DOWN AND THE HEADLIGHTS WERE FLICKERING OR SURGING AND GETTING BRIGHTER AND DIMMER AND BRIGHTER VERY RAPIDLY.   I TURNED ON THE INTERIOR LIGHTS TO BETTER VIEW MY DASH, AND THE INTERIOR LIGHTS WERE SURGING/FLICKERING AS WELL.   IN ONE OF MY PREVIOUS VISITS FOR DEALER REPAIRS, THEY TOLD ME THEY PUT IN A BRAND NEW ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.   HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING AGAIN?   THIS CAR IS BEYOND REPAIR.   I BELIEVE I HAVE A LEMON AND IT IS DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE DRIVING THIS CAR.   I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT AFTER A 25-DAY STINT IN THE DEALER REPAIR CENTER IT'S STILL NOT WORKING.   THIS IS THE LAST OF MANY TRIPS TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS.   INCIDENTALLY, WHILE I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW, I BOUGHT IT AFTER USING IT AS A LOANER WHEN MY 2006 JETTA TDI WAS IN THE SHOP MORE THAN I DROVE IT DURING MY PERIOD OF OWNERSHIP.   THAT CAR HAD SOME ISSUES AS WELL, SO WHEN I LIKED THE PASSAT I DECIDED TO TRADE IT IN.   I'VE ONLY DRIVEN THIS PASSAT FOR LESS THAN 5,000 MILES AND IT IS TERRIBLE.   MY WIFE DRIVES A 2006 JETTA TDI (A DIFFERENT ONE) WHICH RUNS GREAT.   HOW CAN ONLY ONE OF THREE CARS PURCHASED IN LESS THAN A SIX MONTH PERIOD FUNCTION PROPERLY.   THIS IS SERIOUSLY IMPACTING MY VIEWS OF VW QUALITY.   I HAVE TROUBLE WRITING VW AND THE WORD QUALITY IN THE SAME SENTENCE.   THANK GOD I DIDN'T DIE TONIGHT.   *NM",

PROBLEM 2, WHEN I AM AT A COMPLETE STOP/PARKED AND THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE, WHEN I LET OFF THE BRAKE TO \"CREEP\" FORWARD (LIKE IN TRAFFIC) THE CAR SHAKES/THROBS/INCHES FORWARD AS IF THE BRAKES ARE CLAMPING DOWN ON THE DISCS AND LETTING GO REALLY QUICK.

BERT SMITH VW SERVICE PERSON (NOEL APONTE AND HIS SERVICE MANAGER MICHAEL) AND THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE BELOW ISSUES.   FIRST ISSUE:  I HAVE EXTREME IDLE SHAKING OF THE ENGINE.  THIS IS CONSTANT - MEANING YOU WOULD HAVE TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION TO STOP IT. I CAN SHIFT THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL AND STILL FEEL THE SHAKING.  I CAN PUT THE GEAR IN PARK OR IN DRIVE AND IT IS STILL SHAKING. SOMETIMES THE SHAKING IS MILD (LIKE THE SHAKING WHILE BRAKING) OTHER TIMES IT IS SEVERE...SO SEVERE YOU CAN SEE THE ENTIRE CAR SHAKE.   SECOND MAJOR ISSUE:  I DRIVE MY CAR OF A PARKED POSITION (OR AFTER COMING TO A ROLLING STOP AT A LIGHT) AND THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS TRYING TO PULL OR LUNGE FORWARD WHILE MY FOOT WAS PREVIOUSLY ON THE BRAKE.  AT THIS TIME I HAVE TO PUT EXTREME PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES TO KEEP IT FROM MOVING FORWARD.  THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN AND I AM OFF.  I COME TO ANOTHER LIGHT, THE SAME THING HAPPENS.

THIRD ISSUE:  THE CAR SEEMS TO HAVE SEVERE THROTTLE LAG WHILE DRIVING AND AT A STAND STILL.  I AM AT A LIGHT, I PRESS THE GAS PEDAL AND THERE'S SIGNIFICANT LAG TIME BETWEEN THE TIME THE CAR BEGINS TO ROLL.     FOURTH ISSUE:  THE FRONT END SQUEAKING REALLY BAD.
