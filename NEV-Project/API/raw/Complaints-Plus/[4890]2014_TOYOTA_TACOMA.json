The mechanic said the front suspension is too rusted to align. I took the vehicle to a tire shop recommended by the dealer service advisor, and they said it is extremely rusted and sprayed some penetrating oil on it.  I posted some pictures online in a Tacoma forum and everyone thought the rust was excessive, especially for a southern California vehicle where the roads aren't salted. I am the original owner. Based on what I read in online Tacoma forums, excessive frame rust was a well documented problem for earlier years  There is excessive rust and corrosion on the front frame, suspension and steering, preventing proper steering alignment as normal maintenance. The problem was originally identified by the dealer last month during a routine 5,000 mile oil change service; they never notified me about a problem in any previous service, and the problem was independently confirmed by a tire shop when I tried to have them perform a front wheel alignment. There are no warnings or symptoms, and the need for a front end alignment is due to normal wear and tear",

THE 2ND TIME (1/09/2021), THE ABS, AIRBAG, TRACTION CONTROL WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON, AND THE COST OF THE DAMAGE IS NOT YET KNOWN, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE (5 YEARS LATER).     I HAVE HAD 19 PRIOR VEHICLES IN 46 YEARS (8 CHEVROLETS, 2 FORDS, 2 NISSANS, 3 HONDAS, 1 JEEP, 1 PONTIAC, 1 HYUNDAI, AND 1 CHRYSLER), AND I NEVER HAD SUCH SERIOUS RODENT PROBLEMS.  RODENT DAMAGE HAS ALSO  OCCURRED WITH MY PARENT'S TOYOTAS (WHO HAD MANY OTHER VEHICLE BRANDS IN 70 YEARS), AND OTHER NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR NEWER MODEL TOYOTAS. HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES EVER WITH OTHER VEHICLE BRANDS IN THE PAST. ALSO, I HAD A NISSAN FRONTIER AT MY CURRENT ADDRESS IN 2012 AND 2013, AND STILL HAVE A NISSAN ALTIMA AT MY CURRENT ADDRESS, AND RODENTS NEVER CHEWED THE WIRES ON THOSE VEHICLES.    THE PROBLEM IS THAT TOYOTA PUTS SOY  IN THEIR WIRING INSULATION, AND RODENTS FIND IT TASTY.   THERE IS A RESURRECTED CLASS ACTION IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT TOYOTA'S TASTY WIRES.  I ASKED TOYOTA TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT TOYOTA MAINTAINS THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEIR WIRING.  HOWEVER, THE WIRING DOES CONTAIN SOY, AND RODENTS MOST CERTAINLY TO LIKE TO CHEW ON IT.    SO, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME MY 2014 TOYOTA TACOMA HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY RODENTS, DESPITE ME TAKING THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN:  (1)  PLACE BAG OF MOTH BALLS UNDER THE HOOD.  (2) INSTALLED 2  SONIC SOUND DETERRENTS UNDER THE HOOD;  (3) INSTALLED 1 LIGHT-FLASHING DETERRENT UNDER THE HOOD;  (4) SPRAYED THE WHEEL WELLS AND ENGINE WITH PEPPERMINT SPRAY;  (5) INSPECT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT REGULARLY FOR SIGNS OF RODENTS;",

THE RECOMMENDED ACTION TO TAKE WHEN IT IS COLD OUTSIDE AND THE WINDSHIELD BEGINS TO FOG UP WHILE DRIVING IS TO TURN ON THE DEFROSTER ON HIGH HEAT.    2. THE 2014 TACOMA WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO RUN THE DEFROSTER WITH RECIRCULATED AIR, BUT RATHER FORCES ME TO USE 'FRESH' AIR WHEN USING THE DEFROSTER.    THE 2 FACTS LISTED ABOVE MAKE THE TRUCK UNSAFE TO DRIVE IN COLD OR HUMID WEATHER FOR FOLLOWING 2 REASONS:    1. THE FRESH AIR (REQUIRED WHILE USING THE DEFROSTER) IS NOT ACTUALLY FRESH, BUT RATHER SMELLS LIKE WHATEVER AIR HAPPENS TO BE AROUND THE TACOMA AT THAT TIME, WHICH MANY TIMES HAPPENS TO BE THE EXHAUST OF THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF OR NEAR THE TRUCK. THIS DIRTY AIR, CONTAINING HAZARDOUS EXHAUST FUMES NOT ONLY SMELLS BAD, BUT CANNOT BE GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN, LUNGS, AND OVERALL HEALTH. THIS SITUATION IS INTENSIFIED TO THE POINT OF COUGHING AND GAGGING WHEN THERE ARE DIESEL EXHAUST FUMES OR WHILE IDLING AT A RED LIGHT NEAR A LOT OF VEHICLES.    2. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE DIRTY AIR FROM ENTERING THE CAB OF THE TRUCK THROUGH THE DEFROSTER IS TO TURN THE DEFROSTER OFF AND TURN THE AIR TO ANOTHER OPTION (OTHER THAN DEFROST) THAT ALLOWS RECIRCULATED AIR. THIS CREATES AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE SITUATION AS NOW THE WINDSHIELD BEGINS TO FOG UP IMMEDIATELY, CAUSING THE INABILITY TO SEE THE ROAD CLEARLY.    SO IN COLD OR HUMID WEATHER, YOU EITHER CANNOT SEE THE ROAD OR YOU HAVE TO BREATHE IN POISONOUS FUMES.  WITH A 2014 TOYOTA TACOMA, YOU HAVE TO PICK YOUR 'POISON' IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE IN THE COLD.",

I WAS AT THE GROCERY STORE FOR HALF AN HOUR TRYING TO TURN ON MY TRUCK AND THE KEY WOULD NOT TURN. NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO TURN A.C/HEAT ETC. THIS HAS HAPPENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ALREADY. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT SCARES ME IS THE BRAKES. IT STARTED OFF AS A LOUDER THAN USUAL SQUEAKING OF THE BRAKES ONLY WHILE REVERSING. THEN WHEN BRAKING, IT FEELS AS IF THE ABS KICKS IN THEN LET'S GO. THIS HAPPENS OFTEN, EVEN IN MY DRIVEWAY GOING LESS THAN 2 MPG. THE BRAKE PEDAL FEELS EXTREMELY SOFT WHEN PRESSED AND THE PEDAL NEARLY HITS THE FLOOR. IT'S HAPPENED TWICE WHERE THE BRAKES FEEL LIKE THEY LOCK WHILE I'M DRIVING AND AT TIMES THE TRUCK WILL NOT STOP APPROPRIATELY. THE ROAD HAS USUALLY BEEN DRY ON IN THESE CASE.   *TR",

WE SHOPPED AROUND AND ENDED UP LOOKING AT THE TOYOTA TACOMA, NOT THE BEST QUALITY BUT NONE THE LESS DECENT GAS MILEAGE (OR SO WE THOUGHT).
