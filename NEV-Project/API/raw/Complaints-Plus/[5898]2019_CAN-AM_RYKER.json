        "summary": "The VSS Vehicle stability system on the right tire goes on at speeds of 30 MPH or more while making a sweeping left hand turn. Like on a canyon, highway or street. This causes the vehicle to apply brake pressure only to the the right tire and then pulls the vehicle further to the right side while makeing a left turn. This can cause you to drift uncontrollably into the right hand lane, or into a gaurd rail or into another moving vehicle. This has happened numerous times. This is also related the the back tire getting very wobbly at the same time and causes the Ryker to fishtail out of nowhere. I contacted BRP and they told.me they only had 10 or so complaints about this in their system and therefore no Recall. This seems impossible because as you will see from my photos there are many owners with documented proof and something that lots of Can-Am Ryker owners are complaining about. Sometimes the vehicle will shut down and go into limp mode while in motion because of it. There seems to be a TSB bulletin for a pitman arm fix out to the dealerships. However it's not a mandatory recall and if you are out of warranty (which is currently only 12 months) you are forced to pay for it yourself. The other fix is to reset the sensors, but from what I'm seeing it is only a temporary fix of maybe 4 days tops before the issue starts happening again. I'm worried for all Cn-Am Ryker owners, and wish BRP would issue a fix for this very dangerous issue.",
