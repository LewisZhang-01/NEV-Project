I NEVER RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM CHRYSLER OF SUCH A RECALL EVEN THOUGH THE LOCAL SERVICE OFFICE HAS HAD MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER FOR ABOUT A YEAR. AFTER TOWING TO CHRYSLER SERVICE IN SAN JOSE, THE SERVICE MANAGER IN SAN JOSE AND THEIR ONLINE CHAT HELP PERSON SAID THAT THE RECALL DIDN'T APPLY TO MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE REP REFUTED THAT THE ANNOUNCED RECALL WAS FOR AN ALTERNATOR EVEN THOUGH THE ARTICLE CLEARLY SAYS \"THE AUTOMAKER IS ALSO RECALLING 565,000 VEHICLES TO REPLACE THEIR ALTERNATORS BECAUSE OF FIRE RISKS. THE COMPANY SAID HOT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES COULD LEAD TO PREMATURE DIODE WEAR, MAY RESULT IN A BURNING ODOR OR SMOKE, COULD IMPACT THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM OR LEAD TO ENGINE STALLS.\" THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPERIENCED AND THE ARTICLE SAYS IT APPLIED TO MY YEAR MAKE AND MODEL OF VEHICLE. I NEED TO MAKE SURE CHRYSLER/DODGE IS FOLLOWING UP ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD DIE. NOT ONLY AM I ON THE HOOK FOR $1K IN COSTS FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A MANUFACTURER HAZARD. I ALSO DON'T KNOW IF RELATED EXAMINATION/REPLACEMENT WILL OCCUR ON MY VEHICLE... I NEED TO KNOW THAT PROPER PRECAUTION IS TAKEN.

WHILE IDLING, THERE  WAS A LOUD SOUND AND A JOLT FELT IN THE CAR, BUT THE ENGINE WAS STILL IDLING. THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY HAD \"AWD SERVICE\" AND THEN ANOTHER WORD WHICH I DON'T RECALL. WHEN I WENT TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK, I FOUND THE HANDLE SHIFTER ALREADY SHOWED \"P\" AND SO DID THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY. WHEN I TRIED TO CHANGE THE SETTING WITH THE HANDLE SHIFTER, PULLING TOWARD \"D\" DID NOTHING (STILL SHOWED \"P\") AND PUSHING FORWARD PRODUCED A MESSAGE ON THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION ALREADY BEING IN THE SELECTED POSITION. TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING IT (WHICH PROCEEDED NORMALLY) AND RETRYING TO CHANGE THE SHIFT POSITION RESULTED IN THE SAME BEHAVIOR (I.E., NO CHANGE TRYING TO MOVE TO \"D\" AND THE MESSAGE IN THE DISPLAY ABOUT ALREADY BEING IN THE SELECTED POSITION). HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TAKEN ON THE BED OF A TOW TRUCK TO MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER.

AT THAT POINT, I TRIED TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND SHUT IT OFF, BUT THE SHIFTER WAS NOT RESPONSIVE.  THEN, ALL THE SCREENS WENT OUT AND THE CAR DIED.     I CALLED MY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO COME TO EITHER JUMP OR TOW MY CAR. THE TECHNICIAN SHOWED UP AND TRIED TO JUMP START THE VEHICLE, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE CAR WAS THEN TOWED TO A REPAIR SHOP.     THE REPAIR SHOP DISCOVERED THAT THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR WAS FRIED (IN THEIR WORDS) AND THE ALTERNATOR FRIED THE BATTERY AS WELL.  THE REPAIRS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS!   (NOTE) THE FIRST NEW ALTERNATOR THEY INSTALLED WAS FAULTY.    FOR A CAR UNDER 3 YEARS OLD, MAINTAINED IMPECCABLY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS TO HAVE AN ALTERNATOR FAIL IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.     I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CHRYSLER CORP. AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON A 160 AMP ALTERNATOR IN THE CHRYSLER 300. I ASKED AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT THE MANUFACTURER FOR BOTH THE 160 AND 180 AMP ALTERNATORS IS THE SAME.     THE RECALL (OCTOBER 8, 2014) FOR THE SMALLER 160 AMP ALTERNATOR IS ;  NHTSA RECALL #14V-634, AND CHRYSLER RECALL # P60 RESPECTIVELY.        IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROBLEM EXISTS ON BOTH ALTERNATORS.

WHEN I ACCELERATED TO WIDE OPEN THROTTLE (WOT) TO PASS THE TRUCK I MOVED INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE AND SAW A CAR IN THE DISTANCE. I CHANGED MY MIND, RELEASED THE GAS PEDAL, AND APPLIED THE BRAKES; HOWEVER, THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO PRODUCE FULL POWER (APPX 4,500-5,000 RPM) FOR ANOTHER 4-5 SECONDS. I APPLIED THE BRAKES FULLY AND WAS ABLE TO SLOW THE CAR AND SAFELY GET BACK TO THE RIGHT LANE. I NOTIFIED THE DEALER OF THE INCIDENT DURING A SERVICE VISIT AND HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT THE THROTTLE IS DRIVE BY WIRE AND THERE IS NO CABLE THAT CAN GET STUCK. HIS SOLUTION WAS TO CHECK THE FLOOR MAT AND MAKE SURE IT WAS ON THE PEDAL AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO BRING THE CAR IN AND THEY WILL CHECK IT OUT. I REMOVED THE FLOOR MAT AFTER THE INCIDENT (CURRENTLY IN THE TRUNK) AND DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE. HOWEVER, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON MONDAY DECEMBER 21, 2015 AND TOLD ME A VERY SIMILAR STORY (WENT TO FULL THROTTLE FOR 1-2 SECONDS AND WHEN SHE RELEASED THE PEDAL IT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE). I ALREADY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT FOR SATURDAY WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND WILL REPORT THE ISSUE DURING THE VISIT.",

I SENT HER OUT WITH THE CAR FOB. AFTER WHAT SEEMED FOREVER, THE CAR SHUT DOWN, AS THE FOB WAS GONE FOR LONG ENOUGH.

THEY RE-SET THE COMPUTER, AND FOR A BIT OVER A MONTH, IT SEEMED OKAY WITH A FEW HICCUPS, BUT EVENTUALLY, THE CAR HAS BEGUN TO \"STICK\" ON ACCELERATION AGAIN, AND OCCASIONALLY NOW LAGS, OR MISSES, BEFORE ACCELERATION.   I RECEIVED NOTE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER MONTHS AGO. THIS MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE CAR'S PROBLEM, BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL AS FAR AS THE STICKING GOES, SINCE THE PROBLEM LISTED BY THE NOTICE IS STALLING.

ALL SYMPTOMS POINTED TO A LOW BATTERY.  JUMP STARTED 300 FROM OUR OTHER CAR AND DROVE TO THE DEALER.  BY THE TIME I GOT THERE THE BATTERY WAS CHARGED FROM THE GENERATOR.  DEALER KEPT IT FOR 5 DAYS AND COULDN'T FIND A PROBLEM.  THERE WERE OTHER ANOMALIES ON THE ROAD.  CAR WOULD EITHER NOT ACCELERATE OR ENGINE WOULD STALL WHILE DRIVING.  THIS BECAME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ON THE INTERSTATE.  COUPLE WEEKS PASSED AND START PROBLEM REPEATED, BUT THIS TIME THE BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DEAD.  ONE SYMPTOM I NOTICED WAS THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL, WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEPRESS WHILE ACTIVATING THE PUSH BUTTON START WAS LOCKED AND WOULDN'T MOVE.  REPEATED THE ABOVE DRILL WITH THE SAME RESULTS.  THIS TIME, DEALER HAD THE CAR FOR 11 DAYS AND COULDN'T FIND PROBLEM.  ALL ALONG I'M PAYING LEASE AND AUTO INSURANCE FEES FOR A CAR THAT'S SITTING AT THE DEALER.  DEALER SAID THEY UPDATED SOME OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTROLLERS PER SOME TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS, BUT THAT THEY WEREN'T RELATED TO MY \"NO START/DEAD BATTERY\" ISSUES. CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY KNEW OF NO COMPLAINTS, RECALLS, ETC. RELATED TO THE ABOVE.  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS RECENTLY.  HOWEVER, I'VE BEEN STARTING THE 300 MORE OFTEN AND LETTING IT RUN.  I RECENTLY GOT A 2014 DODGE JOURNEY WHICH ENDED UP WITH A DEAD BATTERY AFTER BEING PARKED FOR 5 DAYS. I FILED A SEPARATE COMPLAINT ON THE JOURNEY.  HAVE SINCE BOUGHT A TRICKLE CHARGER.  CAN'T BELIEVE THESE ARE COINCIDENCES.  THERE IS NO QUESTION CHRYSLER HAS A BASIC DESIGN PROBLEM.

THIS MEANS THAT EVERY 2013 CHRYSLER 300 COULD POTENTIALLY BE UNSAFE FOR OPERATION AND THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE THERE ARE INJURIES AND DEATHS DUE TO THIS DEFECT.      CURRENTLY, BOTH THE DEALER AND CHRYSLER CORPORATION ARE REFUSING TO DEAL WITH THE SAFETY CONCERNS FROM THE OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE REGARDING HEAVY RUST FOUND ON THE CHRYSLER 300 AND OTHER MODELS, AND ARE REFUSING TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE VEHICLES WITH SAFER VEHICLES AS THE LEMON LAW REQUIRES THE WHEELS TO COME OFF 2 MORE TIMES BEFORE CHRYSLER EVEN CONSIDERS TO BUY THE VEHICLE BACK. THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT REGARDING A MALFUNCTIONING SUNROOF, FAULTY ELECTRONICS, AND HEADLIGHT PROBLEMS (WHICH ARE ALSO PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MODEL), BUT A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN THAT COULD LEAD TO UNNECESSARY INJURIES BECAUSE THE FAULTY MEXICAN AND CHINESE PARTS USED TO BUILD THE SUSPENSION ARE QUICK TO RUST AND BREAK. PLEASE FILE YOUR COMPLAINTS WITH NHTSA AND LET THEM KNOW THAT RUSTED SUSPENSION PARTS ARE GROUNDS FOR A NATIONAL RECALL.  *TR",
