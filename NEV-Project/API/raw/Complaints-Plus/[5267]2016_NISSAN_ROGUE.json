It has failed three separate times in the past year and remain stuck inside the driver side door unable to go back up. Twice during winter once in the summer. I had to wait weeks during the winter to get the window remedied with a newborn and a 3 year old. They both happened during blizzards where I was forced to figure out how to get my family home safely with window stuck down during a  2 separate winter storms. My dashboard lights are now all lit up , no AWD, traction control, cruise, and a check engine light now. Have had 1 year and had nothing but issues. Now we\u2019re down to one vehicle so my wife drives this vehicle and drops me off at work and drives our children around. The smell of burning plastic is starting to happen and we feel unsafe with our children in this car. The next step will most likely be the fire that was mentioned as an issue from this known problem and we are already smelling  the burning driving. We have reached out to dealers and anyone who would listen. We were told no loaner vehicle and to drive it until it catches fire with our kids inside\u2026. All figure it out and wait for the recall fix to come \u201ceventually\u201d. We are out of choices and feel unsafe in this vehicle. We have been provided no solutions, this is our only vehicle, and we still are paying monthly on it even in this condition.",

Over time it progressively became more frequent. It failed completely at 96k miles with i's last run that took around 5 seconds from accelerator was pressed to the car moving. At which point, the car jutted out into traffic but was unable to accelerate. These problems have caused potential accidents where I could have rear-ended someone else because of the sudden fast movement after a delay. Or in the case of the last run (which incident is being reported), cars behind me had to swerve to avoid hitting me because I was unable to get car moving at the traffic's speed. The check engine light came on after the fact, but there were never any warning lamps or messages related to the transmission prior to the incident and because of this the dealership was unable to discuss with manufacturer early on about a warranty exception.",

The NHTSA does not seem to be concerned with the safety of those that have filed complaints regarding this issue, as they have not ordered a recall. I was even informed earlier that there were no complaints on record, so either the representative did not look closely enough, or at all. To explain the issue all you have to do is look at all other complaints regarding the CVT issue in the Nissan models, lack of acceleration, increased rpms due to revving, lagging when driving, increased shaking when stopped. Please take the complaints serious and have Nissan fix the defect that they are more than aware of. Nissan only acknowledges a problem after warranty expires, and now they are minimally extending warranties to address problem, but most have already gone over mileage extension. This needs to be addressed as an imminent safety issue.",

Each time it is due to a broken seal around the headlight, which allowed water to come in and short circuit the headlight & making the non-bright function null. Brights still work. After taking it to 2 separate local Nissan dealerships, they both concluded it was indeed a faulty headlight / design and both indicated it would be $1600 to replace with a new one. After relaying this info to Nissan Corporate, they said they wouldn't help with their \"Goodwill Program\" since they'd already done so the last time the headlight was replaced and because of the age of the vehicle. However, as I mentioned to the Nissan rep, the issue has never truly been FIXED (ie: the seal area around the headlight to prevent moisture shorting out the light) since the previous headlights have all given out in the exact way.  My perception is this is just a poorly designed vehicle that Nissan was willing to flood into the market but was never intended to last more than 5-6 years, nor was Nissan willing to stand behind and admit their design mistakes. By the way, I have a 2015 Armada with more miles than my Rogue and those headlights are still as bright as ever.",

It was too unsafe to pull off on highway breakdown lane because it\u2019s too narrow. The vehicle was then towed to Nissan dealership where it was confirmed to be a transmission failure at no fault of my own, but a \u201cmechanical failure\u201d as they described and they fixed.",

I was thinking it just because the ECO mode is On. Then I turn it OFF but it still slowly  reaches desired speed. On July 9, 2021 about 4 months after noticing the problems with acceleration,  I was driving and car just starts making jerking, stalling movements while driving and the RPM's was jumping up and down especially when you start driving and reaching  the speed limit of about 45mph. I took it for another test drive and it was jerking, shaking and stalling a lot and making very loud noise. Feel like the car will stop suddenly at the middle of the road causing hazard for other drivers and involve in the accident.  Check Engine light came ON.  Very slowly came home and then ask independent mechanic to check the car.  The Code reads P0841 and P0776. Tried to erase the codes but check engine light was still on.  Changing the transmission oil, filter and gasket didn't resolve the problem, the Check Engine light is OFF though, for now , but the car still  jerks. Slowly pressing the gas pedal and the RPM\"s jumps to 3 then back to normal and car stalls and jerks. You can hear that it starts from the front bottom of the car and  goes back through  the whole car. Very scared to drive the car. I thought that Nissan is very reliable car, but not thinking that anymore. I also found that there are lot more complains about the transmission and even the law suits started in 2013 and 2021 and that Nissan knows about the problem with CVT transmission since 2013 but not doing anything about it.

I called Nissan and because I am out of warranty they will not evaluate at their cost or fix it if it\u2019s the same issue as the recall. I have not had it evaluated as I wanted to reach out to the NHTSA first.  There were no warning lights to alert me to this issue. One day it just happened coming down hard and striking me in the head. I was really hurt. I had a headache for the entire day and small bump on the back of my head. It was not serious enough to see a doctor but doesn\u2019t change the fact that I got hurt   I am very nervous that the next time I open it it won\u2019t stop about halfway and  the full weight of the lift gate will come crashing down on me or someone else and cause serious injury.

A few times I noticed that I did not have my seatbelt on while driving which for me, is highly unusual because it is the first thing I do once I start my engine. It is the AUDIBLE chime that alerts me. I then specifically started my engine and realized that the car DID NOT have a safety belt CHIME. ( FMVSS 208 S7.3 )  I took it to a Nissan dealer. The technician told me that Nissan DID NOT  put a safety belt audible chime in ANY of their vehicles before 2020. I could not believe what I was hearing. Not only is this feature federal law but, it is also in the Nissan owners manual. It is not a feature that can be turned on or off. It is a federal requirement.   Nissan is  violating federal law and has been doing so for years at the expense of the American people. I am worried for my safety and the safety of others since it is difficult to DISCOVER that there is no audible seat belt safety chime and that it is a safety issue that might prevent one from putting on their seatbelt so that they don\u2019t go flying through the front windshield. Federal law states: \u201cmanufacturers have an OPTION. They can EITHER use a seatbelt symbol AND an audible chime OR The words \u201c Seat Belt\u201d AND An audible chime\u201d.  The audible chime is not an OPTION it is a requirement.   The chime is NOT a feature that can be turned on or off in any Nissan vehicle including my 2016 Nissan Rogue.   The consumer needs to know about this missing safety feature as per Federal law. I wonder how many lives have been lost because Someone just like me, needed that audible safety belt chime to remind them that their seat belt was not buckled and it cost them their lives.  There is a reason that the safety belt safety law has two components. A VISUAL and an AUDIBLE safety belt feature. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards exist for the safety of the American people.

Since I lived in a small town, I was able to coast, to the side of the road, but still in the road. I thought a new mat had probably slid under the gas pedaI so I  removed the mat. I did notice a few hesitations without the mat but not enough to worry me. Then, I was on a four-lane highway, At a red light. The light changed, I pressed on the gas, the car moved forward. I lost complete acceleration again no matter how much I pressed the gas pedal. I had enough momentum to just get in between the right turn lane and traffic going straight from the other direction .  The motor never died. After a few seconds, the car drove like nothing had ever happened. My first visit to the dealership. They were baffled. No problem until 10 months later at 37,000 miles. This time a mechanic decided the idle was low and \u201crelearned\u201d it. I felt confident. Then I moved to a large metropolitan city.  I enter a major road each time I leave my house.Twenty-two months later,  and at 57,000 miles, it once again lost power in the LEFT-HAND lane of a 2 lane turn. I considered myself lucky one more time. I was able to COAST between cars in the right turn lane,  across two more lanes and into a store parking lot. A few seconds of sitting still and off again. The second incident was a couple days later on a two hour interstate trip with passengers. Same story. After the trip home over the weekend, I had the car at a second dealership . That was when I found multiple recalls and lawsuits about Nissan CVT transmissions slipping.

I FILED A BBB AUTOLINE COMPLAINT AND THEY SAID THEY ONLY HELP WITH CARS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD.  MY SECOND TRANSMISSION WAS PUT IN ON MAY 14TH AND WENT OUT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 27TH. I NOTICED ISSUES THIS TIME AS SOON AS WE HEADED TO MARYLAND.  IT STALLED OUT COMPLETELY WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AGAIN.  THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE.  I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THIS CAR AND AM ON A THIRD TRANSMISSION.  THERE WAS A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN FOR THE EXACT TRANSMISSION IN 2019 ON OTHER MODELS.  *TR",

MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 41,000 MILES ON IT.

THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL WAS VERY UPFRONT AND HONEST WITH ME AND TOLD ME IT WAS DEFINITELY THE TRANSMISSION AND NISSAN HAS TONS OF THESE ISSUES WITH THEIR VEHICLES.  MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR OVER A WEEK NOW FOR A TRANSMISSION REBUILD. HOWEVER, NISSAN IS NOT OFFERING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OR ANYTHING ON IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THEY ARE FAULTY AND DANGEROUS, I WILL ONLY HAVE 20,000 MILES LEFT ON MY WARRANTY ONCE I PICK MY CARE UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP. NISSAN DOESN'T OFFER LOANER CARS TO THOSE WITH WARRANTY WORK THAT NEEDS DONE, WE HAVE TO PAY $35 A DAY DUE TO THEIR FAULTY VEHICLES, THE LEAST THEY CAN DO IS OFFER LOANER VEHICLES FOR WARRANTY WORK! NISSAN NEEDS TO HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LEMON VEHICLES AND BE REQUIRED TO BUY THEM BACK ON THE FIRST TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR, EVEN WITH THE REBUILT TRANSMISSION AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO TRADE THE CAR IN, ROLL OVER THOUSANDS TO ANOTHER VEHICLE LOAN AND PAY $1500 OR MORE IN TAXES TO LICENSE AND TITLE ANOTHER VEHICLE. NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AND THEY NEED TO BE FINED FOR THEIR CONTINUED USE OF FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS AND MADE TO BUY BACK FAULTY AND DANGEROUS VEHICLES.",

THERE ARE TOO MANY INCONSISTENCIES, INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE PERSON FOUND RESPONSIBLE, AND THE MAKE OF HIS CAR.

IT WAS INDICATING LOW PRESSURE WHILE IN FACT THE PRESSURE WAS TOO HIGH, OVER 40PSI. I CHECKED AND ADJUSTED TIRE PRESSURE IN DISCOUNT TIRE IN CARSON CITY, NV; THE FAULT MESSAGE DID NOT GO AWAY.
