Apparently it is on backorder and there is nothing Jeep can to and the only way you can get one emergently, is to have your car break down  The following day I was driving and my vehicle completely stopped without warning. I was able to pull over. My car was not drivable and had to be towed. I called Jeep and the service manager laughed and said the part was on backorder. My brother was able to find an aftermarket part to replace it.   I filed a claim with Jeep to cover it and replace the part and they told me there is no recall and they will not do it. My car is 6 years old, which is not old for a Jeep. Upon looking on-line, this is an ongoing issue with Jeep Compasses since 2015. Jeep knows this is a SAFETY issue and they are not recalling the part. If I was on the highway when this happened, I would have been killed. There is no warning at all. You are at a speed and then the car just shuts  down. There is no warning. This needs to be investigated as it is a serious safety defect with the vehicle that Jeep knows about and is refusing to put the safety of their customers first.",

I ASKED IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A RENTAL THROUGH THEM THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR IT. I STARTED A CASE WITH CHRYSLER ON 07/29 AND AM STILL WAITING ON THE SPECIALIST TO REVIEW THIS. I AM FRUSTRATED. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY IS ANOTHER DAY THAT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO WORK WHETHER IT BE ASKING FOR A RIDE OR PAYING FOR A RENTAL OUT OF POCKET. I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF I GOT IN A WRECK AND THE SENSOR MESSED UP I WOULD PAY FOR IT MYSELF NO QUESTIONS ASKED. ALL I'M ASKING IS FOR CHRYSLER TO HONOR THE SAFETY RECALL AND FIX THIS ISSUE. IF YOU WERE IN THE SAME POSITION I'M SURE YOU WOULD BE STRESSED OUT AS WELL. THE CAR IS NOT SAFE AND HAS LEFT ME STRANDED WHILE I WAS DRIVING, NOW 4 TIMES. MY CAR IS 2016 THERE IS NO REASON THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING!!!! ALSO, I HAVE KEPT ALL RECEIPT AND WOULD LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE HEADACHE & UNNECESSARY CHARGES THAT THIS HAS CAUSED ME.",

NO WARNING WHAT SO EVER.  THIS SITUATION WAS VERY DANGEROUS AS MY CAR WOULD LOSE POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 4 WAY INTERSECTION, IT WOULD SHUT OFF ON THE FREEWAY.  STALL OUT AND SHUT OFF AT STOP LIGHTS.  I WAS AFRAID OF DRIVING MY CAR BUT I HAD TO GET TO WORK WHICH WAS 30 MILES AWAY FROM MY HOME.  2 MECHANICS TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE ON DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SHOWED NO CODES, THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT. FINALLY A MECHANIC LOOKED AT MY RESEARCH AND AGREED TO REPLACE THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR WHICH HAD BEEN RECALLED ON 2016 COMPASS JEEP BUT MY VIN WAS NOT UNDER THE RECALL (WHY)  AFTER THIS SENSOR WAS REPLACED THE CAR DROVE PERFECTLY, NO MORE STALLED ENGINE AND SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING.  I BELEIVE THAT JEEP CHRYSLER SHOULD PAY FOR THIS REPAIR AS IT IS A 2016 JEEP COMPASS AND THEY HAVE FIXED OTHERS.  I WILL NEVER BUY A JEEP OR CHRYSLER.  MOST SCARY CAR PROBLEM I EVER ENCOUNTERED.  I AM A 55 YEAR OLD DRIVER, HAVING DRIVEN OVER A MILLION MILES IN MY LIFE TIME.  TO HAVE A CAR SHUT OFF ITS ENGINE IN MID FLIGHT IS VERY DANGEROUS.

        "summary": "SEVERE TIRE WEAR ON JEEP COMPASS  ON 05/12/16 I TOOK A RENTAL CAR (JEEP COMPASS, MILEAGE: 10417) IN LAS VEGAS. ON 05/26/16, JUST AS WE HAD PASSED THE MOUNTAIN ROUTES FROM DURANGO TO OURAY, I DISCOVERED BY CHANCE THAT BOTH FRONT TIRES WERE COMPLETELY WORN OUT ON THE INSIDE (SEE PHOTOS). I DID NOT DISCOVER IT EARLIER, BECAUSE THE TIRE TREAD WAS O.K. ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE BODY HIDED THE REST OF THE TIRE.  THEN I DROVE VERY SLOWLY. SOON AFTER CAME THE WARNING LIGHT FOR THE TIRE PRESSURE: THE LEFT FRONT TIRE LOST PRESSURE (MILEAGE APPROXIMATELY: 12250). I CHANGED THE WHEEL AND WAS HOPING THAT THE RIGHT TIRE HELD AIR TO THE NEAREST TOWN. WE REACHED THE TOWN WITHOUT FURTHER PROBLEM. AS I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE TIRE SHOP, THEY TOLD ME, THAT THE TOE WAS COMPLETELY WRONG AND THAT WHEEL ALIGNMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY (SEE ALIGNMENT REPORT).  SUMMARY: THE CAUSE OF THIS SYMMETRIC TIRE WEAR IS MYSTERIOUS: THE CAR HAD RELATIVELY FEW MILES AND THERE WAS NO EVENT (SUCH AS AN IMPACT TO THE WHEELS), THAT POSSIBLY COULD HAVE CHANGED THE TOE. NEVERTHELESS I THINK, THE CAR WAS NOT ROADWORTHY AND I'M GLAD I NOTICED THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT CAME TO AN ACCIDENT.    I SEND THIS REPORT FROM GERMANY. AS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND MY TELEPHONE NUMBER, I GIVE YOU THE STATE AND PHONE NUMBER OF THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY.",
