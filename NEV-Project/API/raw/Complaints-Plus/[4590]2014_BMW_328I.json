March 2022 (<30 days later), suffered catastrophic engine failure related to camshaft oil starvation and sudden loss of power while driving on highway at 60 mph. Dealership investigation unable to determine the cause, ruled out N20 timing chain and oil pump chain issues. Neither BMW NA nor dealership would stand behind engine failure - BMW NA stated the \"car is too old.\" Full engine replacement completed at the expense of the customer ($11K). Very disappointing that an engine would suffer catastrophic failure related to oil starvation within one month of dealership oil service with multi-point inspection. BMW F30 N20 engines have numerous reports of failures.",

Vehicles were narrowly missing me & blowing their horns while I was trying to coast off of the side of the roadway. All this happened in about 20 to 25 seconds.The car has been in the garage for 6 months & a confirmation was made on the timing chain guide failure. The inlet screen to the oil pump has pieces of the broken guides stuck in it which restricted the oil flow to the entire engine. Both front & rear crankshaft bearings were seized up & spun inside the engine block.

TO HAVE THIS FACTORY PROBLEM FIXED IS UPWARDS OF 2,000$, THAT OWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM WITH ALMOST EVERY BMW. ALSO BMW HAS HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE BLOWER MOTOR OR HEATER MOTOR. IT IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THESE MODEL BMWS THAT BMW REFUSES TO RECALL. THE HEATER WILL NOT WORK AT ALL OR ONLY THE DRIVER SIDE WILL BLOW SLIGHTLY WARM AIR BECAUSE OF BMWS FAULTY BLOWER MOTOR. ALSO THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM WILL POWER OFF OR STOP WORKING IN GENERAL. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT ISSUES THE VEHICLE IS HAVING. BMW HAS TO HAVE SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THESE ISSUES BASED OFF ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THESE SAME ISSUES, BUT HAS REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO INSURE THE SAFTEY OF THE PEOPLE OPERATING THERE VEHICLES WITH THESE FACTORY DEFAULTS.

THE PICKUP TRUCK WASN'T EQUIPPED WITH CRUISE CONTROL LIKE MY BLACK 328I BMW WAS SO THEY (A COUPLE) WERE TRAVELING SLOWER THAN I WAS AT THAT TIME. SO AS MY VEHICLE APPROACHES 4 SECONDS AWAY FROM THEIRS TRAVELING 75MPH (+ OR - 2 MPH). THEY BRAKED TO CHANGE LANES FROM THE LANE WE WERE TRAVELING TOGETHER TO THE OTHER LINE SINCE IT WAS A TWO LANE HIGHWAY. THEY DIDN'T SLAM THEIR BRAKES, THEY LIGHTLY PRESSED THEM BECAUSE A THIRD VEHICLE THEY WERE WAITING TO PASS IN ORDER TO SAFELY SWITCH LANES AND GIVE ME THE RIGHT AWAY.

I DON'T FEEL SAFE ON THE ROAD BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHEN ITS GOING TO STALL/MISFIRE ON THE INTERSTATE AGAIN.  WILL IT BE IN FRONT OF A SEMI TRUCK THAT REAR ENDS ME OR WILL I GET HIT TRYING TO GET OFF THE ROAD TO RESTART/RESET IT.  WILL IT RESTART AT ALL?  I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE MODEL. THIS IS THE SECOND CAR WITH THE SAME ENGINE DEFECT.  I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE JUST WAITING TILL MY WARRANTY GOES OUT, WHERE THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME EVEN MORE.  *TR",
