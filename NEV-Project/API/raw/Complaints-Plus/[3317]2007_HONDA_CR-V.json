I had to slam on the brake to stop it but by then I had hit the car parked next to me as well as the grocery cart return racks. I did significant damage to both but no one was hurt. A routine maneuver turned into a terrifying event. It felt as if the car went from going routinely in reverse to taking off in drive. At first I thought that my foot had slipped off the brake and stated as much but I was speaking kind of out of shock and bewilderment, it was a pretty intense experience. My foot would not have been on the braked since I was backing out. There were obstacles to my pulling forward, namely the grocery cart return racks. When it was over I turned off my engine and my transmission locked and stayed that way for about 10 minutes. I had a similar experience in March 2019 but it was after a very heavy snowstorm so I didn't file a claim with the insurance carrier, I thought it must be condition related but conditions were perfect yesterday. I noticed that there are similar complaints listed here so what does it take to initiate a recall? I also noticed that a milder version of what I experienced was cause for a recall on the 2008 Honda Ridgeline associated with the accelerator pedal assembly. That resulted in the assembly being replaced in Honda CR-Vs through 2006 so I wonder whether 2007's have a variation of the same problem or they should have been included in that recall. I've filed an insurance claim and I've contacted American Honda but their attitude toward it is pretty casual. Uploading pics of the collision, the idea being that they show the damage done as I am moving forward even though I started out backing up. I don't thing you accept Mac movie formats. Thanks.",

TURNED IN MY VEHICLE AND PROCURED RENTAL 4/08/16.  RETURNED TO RENTAL COMPANY TO EXTEND RENTAL 5/25/16. PICKED-UP MY VEHICLE FROM DEALERSHIP 6/08/16.

I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FURTHER DOCUMENTATION RE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT OF DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG.  TO SAY I AM FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY, AT THIS POINT, 5 MONTHS LATER, IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.  I HAVE BEEN THE OWNER OF 2 OTHER HONDA VEHICLES AND I MUST SAY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE  SERVICE, OR, LACK THEREOF, FROM HONDA.  WAITING FOR THIS RECALL HAS BEEN AN INCONVENIENCE THAT'S NOT ONLY AFFECTED ME, BUT ALSO MY DISABLED AUNT WHO DEPENDS ON ME FOR TRANSPORTATION TO VARIOUS DESTINATIONS.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE BACK SEAT OF MY CRV AS IT IS PHYSICALLY HIGHER THAN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS WITH CHRONIC KNEE AND BACK PAIN.

EVEN AFTER LOCKING THE VEHICLE, THE DOOR CAN BE OPENED BY PASSENGERS OR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.  THIS POSES A SERIOUS RISK FOR YOUNG PASSENGERS WHO MAY OPEN THE DOOR WHILE IN MOTION IF THE CHILD SAFETY LEVER IS NOT ACTIVATED.  I HAVE ALREADY PAID THE HONDA DEALERSHIP TO REPAIR THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE LOCK ACTUATOR, BUT AFTER THE FRONT LOCK ACTUATOR REPAIR, THE REAR LOCK ACTUATOR BROKE.  IN 2015, HONDA ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE LOCKS, BUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS FROM THE ISSUE DATE OF THE LETTER.  MY LOCK ACTUATORS BROKE SHORTLY AFTER THE END OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD.  I ATTEMPTED TO HAVE HONDA REPAIR THE LOCKS AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THEY REFUSED.  I AM REQUESTING THAT THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE TO DETERMINE THAT THE DEFECTIVE LOCK ACTUATORS ARE A SAFETY ISSUE AND A RECALL IS NECESSARY.

I WOULD NEED TO PAY MORE FOR AN SUV PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 12.99 PER DAY, SINCE MY SON WASN'T 25 YEARS OLD. THEY PROMISED TO CALL AS SOON AS THE PART WAS AVAILABLE IN JULY. I CONTACTED THEM SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE JULY, THEN IN AUGUST WHEN THE AGENT SAID SHE WOULD ASK THE MANAGER TO AUTHORIZE DETAILING OF MY CAR, SINCE MOLD HAD GROWN ALL OVER THE INTERIOR AND MY CAR BATTERY DIED TWICE.   I AGAIN LEFT A MESSAGE ON SEPTEMBER 2 TO ADVISE THAT I WANTED TO PICK UP A RENTAL CAR ON SEPTEMBER 5TH, HAVE MY CAR CLEANED AND REPAIRED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TERRY, FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RETURNED MY CALL AT 6:26 PM, AND ASKED IF I EVER CONTACTED HONDA, THEN ADVISED THAT THEY NO LONGER OFFERED A RENTAL CAR, (AS OF A WEEK OR TWO AGO) AND THE SERVICE MANAGER COULD CALL ME BACK ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6. THEN, WHEN I BECAME UPSET, SHE OFFERED AN APPOINTMENT ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9TH TO REPLACE THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG. IF THE APPOINTMENT WAS AVAILABLE, WHY WASN'T I CALLED AND SCHEDULED SOONER? WE REALIZE IT WAS NOT THE FAULT OF PACIFIC HONDA, THAT THE AIRBAG WAS DEFECTIVE, HOWEVER, IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION IN A TIMELY MANNER AND OFFER A COMPARABLE REPLACEMENT OR COMPENSATION FOR THE INCONVENIENCE WHEN A COMPARABLE REPLACEMENT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE IS NOT OFFERED. WE THINK WE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN REASONABLE WAITING FOR THE PART, AS WELL AS SAVING HONDA OVER $5,400.00 IN RENTAL CAR FEES (AS I COULD HAVE HAD IT FOR OVER THE PAST 150+ DAYS AT 35.99 PER DAY)",

I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE AND THE RESPONSE WAS \"I'T JUST AS UNSAFE AS IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 9 YEARS\". REALLY COMFORTING.     I CALLED BACK IN JULY AND THEY WERE ON A TWO WEEK WAIT TO REPAIR THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG. ON JULY 22, THEY LOANED ME A VEHICLE TO DRIVE IN THE INTERIM. ON AUGUST 8, THEY REPAIRED MY DRIVER AIRBAG BUT STILL DID NOT HAVE PARTS FOR THE RECALLED PASSENGER AIRBAG. THEY TOOK BACK THE LOANER AND SAID THAT ALL OF MY PASSENGERS NEED TO RIDE INT HE BACK SEAT UNTIL THEY CAN FIX IT. THIS IS AN ABSURD SOLUTION FOR A FAMILY. I PURCHASED A FAMILY SIZED VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT MY LARGE FAMILY. I STARTED A CASE WITH HONDA CORPORATE THAT DAY AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD REVIEW IT AND GET BACK TO ME IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS. I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AFTER NOT HEARING FROM THEM AND FINALLY HEARD BACK FROM THEM TODAY, AUGUST 24. THEY WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE ANOTHER LOANER FOR THE PASSENGER AIRBAG RECALL AND SAID THAT I COULD DRIVE THE UNSAFE VEHICLE FOR ANOTHER WEEK UNTIL THE PARTS CAME IN.     THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH HONDA IS VERY POOR. I UNDERSTAND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE CALLING BECAUSE OF THIS RECALL BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK. HONDA ONLY CARES ABOUT THE MONEY, NOT THE PEOPLE. TO TELL A FAMILY THAT A GREAT SOLUTION IS FOR EVERY ONE TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT IS NOT HELPING. I KNOW THESE THINGS TAKE TIME, AND I'M HAPPY TO BE PATIENT AS LONG AS YOU ARE WORKING WITH ME AS WELL. HONDA IS NOT DOING THIS.",

THE HUMIDITY IN MY AREA THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN IN THE 80'S AND 90'S.

THIS WAS DONE ON AUGUST 12, 2016. AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR A LOANER EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NOT REPAIRED THE PASSENGER-SIDE AIRBAG BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PARTS. I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR WAS STILL DANGEROUS, HOWEVER, IN THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PASSENGER IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. I DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, AND HE AND I BOTH AGREED THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY SOLUTION. BESIDES THE INCONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING A USABLE PASSENGER SEAT, IF THE PASSENGER-SIDE AIRBAG DID DEPLOY, IT WOULD SEEM POSSIBLE THAT METAL PARTS COULD SCATTER THROUGHOUT THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.

HONDA APPARENTLY WILL NOT PAY FOR A LOANER CAR, SINCE THE CAR IS NOW \"DRIVABLE\". UNTIL THE PASSENGER AIRBAG CAN BE REPAIRED, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.

THE PROPOSED SOLUTION BY HONDA \"AVOID HAVING A PASSENGER SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SEAT UNTIL RECALL IS REPAIRED\" IS NOT A REALISTIC SOLUTION. I TRANSPORT MULTIPLE PASSENGERS AND NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SEAT. I CALLED HONDA AUTOMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON 7/26/16 TO REQUEST AN ALTERNATE VEHICLE.  I WAS TOLD A CASE MANGER WOULD CALL ME WITHIN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS.  THEY ALSO STATED THEY WOULD ESCALATE MY REQUEST SO THAT I COULD GET A RESPONSE SOONER.  I'VE MADE FOUR MORE CALLS SINCE THE INITIAL ONE WITH THE LATEST BEING ON 8/6/16.  EACH TIME THE HONDA REP SAID THEY WOULD ESCALATE MY CASE FOR A QUICKER RESPONSE BUT CASE MANGERS ARE OVERLOADED.  AS OF TODAY, 8/8/16, I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE FIRST CALL FROM A CASE MANGER CONCERNING THE REQUEST FOR AN ALTERNATE VEHICLE. THIS IS TOTAL UNSAT AND I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS ISSUE WITH HONDA. HONDA'S LACK OF PROPER PLANNING  TO HANDLE THE RESPONSE TO THE SAFETY RECALL THEY SENT OUT IS CAUSING A HARDSHIP FOR THOSE THAT NEED TO USE THE PASSENGER'S SEAT. HONDA SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO HIRE MORE CASE MANGERS AND WORK OFF THE BACKLOG OF REQUEST SOONEST.  THEY SHOULD ALSO BE DIRECTED TO HAVE A CASE MANGER CALL ME CONCERNING MY REQUEST.  THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE IN THIS MATTER.",

THIS CREATES A GREAT INCONVENIENCE FOR US , WE ARE DRIVING SOMETIMES APP. FOUR HOURS ON A ROAD TRIP AND THE PASSENGER WOULD BE CONFINED IN THE BACK SEAT. WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAVE FOUR PASSENGERS?  I GREATLY WOULD APPRECIATE AN ANSWER. ALSO, I TRIED TO CONTACT A HONDA DEALER SHIP IN NORTH MIAMI FL. AND THE PHONE WRANG MORE THAN 20 TIMES AND NOBODY ANSWERED THE PHONE, I COULD NOT EVEN GET TO SPEAK TO AN OPERATOR. THE RICK CASE HONDA DEALER IS UNFORTUNATELY APP. A 60 MILE ROUND  TRIP FOR US, THEREFORE WE CAN NOT GO BACK THERE TO HAVE THE PASSENGER AIR BAG REPLACED. I NEED A DEALER CLOSER TO MY HOME THAT COULD REPLACE THE AIRBAG ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AND AT THE SAME TIME REPLACE THE DOOR LOCK. ALSO, A GREAT CONCERN TO ME IS THIS LATE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.HOW LONG WAS IT KNOWN THAT THE PASSENGER AIR  BAG IS ALSO FAULTY?

AS OF TODAY (07/19/2016), THE DEALER DOES STILL NOT HAVE THE PART.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT AT BOTH AMERICAN HONDA FOR NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THE RECALLED AIRBAGS TO THEIR DEALERS AND TO PIAZZA HONDA FOR NOT ORDERING THE PART IN A TIMELY FASHION WHEN RECEIPT OF THE RECALL WAS RECEIVED IN MARCH.  THIS IS POTENTIALLY A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT HAS BEEN HANDLED VERY NEGLIGENTLY BY BOTH AMERICAN HONDA AND MIKE PIZZA HONDA.

I ASKED FOR SUCH INSTRUCTIONS IN WRITING WHICH \"JEAN\" WAS QUITE HESITANT TO DO.  \"JEAN\" EVENTUALLY SAID SHE WOULD REFER TO HER SUPERVISOR AND REVERT TO ME WITH THE AUTHORIZATION I SOUGHT, INCLUSIVE OF COURSE WITH RENTAL COSTS LIMITS THAT I HAD ALSO ASKED ABOUT.

CROWN HONDA'S SERVICE ADVISOR (JAMES G. MCLAUGHLIN) TOLD ME THE PART(S) NECESSARY TO FIX MY CAR WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL LATE SUMMER 2016, BUT THAT I SHOULD NOT WORRY BECAUSE THE STATISTICAL PROBABILITY OF EITHER MYSELF OR A PASSENGER IN MY VEHICLE SUFFERING ANY KIND OF HARM OR INJURY IS HIGHLY REMOTE. I MENTIONED THAT MY VEHICLE IS APPARENTLY AT GREATER RISK OF THE FAULTY PART(S) FAILING BECAUSE IT IS AN OLDER VEHICLE BEING OPERATED IN A VERY HIGH HUMIDITY/HIGH TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT - THE TAMPA BAY AREA OF FLORIDA. MR. MCLAUGHLIN WAS STILL OF THE VIEW I SHOULD NOT BE TOO CONCERNED AS THE WHOLE RECALL MATTER HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION BY NHTSA. BUT WHILE DRIVING YESTERDAY I HEARD SOME UNUSUALLY WEIRD NOISES COMING FROM WHERE MY DRIVER AND PASSENGER FRONT AIRBAGS ARE LOCATED AND I WAS VERY FEARFUL OF AN AIRBAG INFLATOR FAILURE BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY HOT HUMID DAY. MY DEALER HAS REFUSED TO CONFIRM WHETHER MY VEHICLE WILL BE RECEIVING PRIORITY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT IS OPERATED. YESTERDAY I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AT 1-888-234-2138 AND SPOKE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP NAMED EMMIT LOCATED IN TORRANCE CA AND HE TOO WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER MY VEHICLE WAS ON A PRIORITY LIST GIVEN ITS MUCH HIGHER RISK OF THE PART(S) FAILING.

I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT, IF THIS HAPPENS IN A CRUCIAL TIME WHEN WE WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR AND ALL ARE INSIDE THE CAR.WHEN I SAID THIS TO MY FRIEND WHO OWNS 2008 CRV, HE SAID THAT HE IS ALSO HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND HE REFERRED ANOTHER FRIEND WHO HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. SO I THINK WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE TO AVOID ANY TERRIBLE SITUATION IN FUTURE. IF NEEDED I CAN SHARE TWO OF MY FRIENDS INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.

IN ADDITION, WITH CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT, THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT THEM FROM OPENING THE DOOR WHILE DRIVING. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR INTO HONDA SIX TIMES REGARDING THE DIFFERENT  DOORS AND EACH TIME HAVE HAD TO FIGHT WITH THEM REGARDING FIXING THIS PROBLEM.

I DID NOT GET THE LAST TWO FIXED RIGHT AWAY DUE TO THE COST (WITH 2 IT WOULD BE AROUND $500.00 WHICH I DID NOT HAVE AT THE TIME) BUT IT BECAME A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM BECAUSE I COULD NOT LOCK MY CAR.

WE SWERVING ACROSS SIX LANES OF TRAFFIC, ALMOST FLIPPED, AND NARROWLY AVOIDED CRASHING INTO CONCRETE A WALL BEFORE I FINALLY  OBTAINED CONTROL OF THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO PULLEY OFF ONTO THE EMERGENCY LANE.    OUR VEHICLE WAS SERVICED BY GOODYEAR IN OCTOBER, AND THE TIRES WERE INSPECTED AND ROTATED AT THAT TIME. AT THE TIME OF THE BLOWOUT, THE TIRES ONLY HAD 27,000 MILES ON THEM.  THEY ARE WARRANTIED FOR 65,000 MILES.     WE CONTACTED THE GOODYEAR STORE THE NEXT DAY, AND THE MANAGER INSPECTED THE TIRE AND COULD NOT DETERMINE WHY THE TIRE BLEW OUT. HE ASKED IF WE HIT SOMETHING.  WE DIDN'T HIT A THING.  WE JUST HEARD A POP.  THE ASSISTANT  MANAGER OF THE STORE STATED, \"THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY,\" REGARDING OUR STATEMENT THAT WE HIT NOTHING. THE TIRE WAS NOT TORN, BUT WAS SPLIT FROM RIM TO RIM, COMPLETELY SEVERING THE BELTS.    MY WIFE AND I  COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS ACCIDENT AND OTHER DRIVERS COULD HAVE SERIOUSLY INJURED AS WELL.  WE DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN.     GOODYEAR CLAIMS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES, BUT WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT BLOWOUTS ON GOODYEAR ASSURANCE TIRES.

AS NOTHING HAPPENED, I LOOKED UNDER CAR, & THE WASHER SOLUTION WAS RUNNING OUT ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR, AS I POURED IT INTO JUG.  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION, I FOUND PIECES OF THE TUBING THAT HAD BEEN CHEWED ON, AND IN SOME AREAS, CHEWED COMPLETELY THROUGH.  ONE OF THESE AREAS I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS VIA A PLASTIC DOOR, ABOUT 12 INCHES WIDE, BY ABOUT 2 INCHES IN HEIGHT, LOCATED UNDER THE HOOD, IN THE CENTER OF THE FIREWALL, JUST BELOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  I FOUND PIECES OF TUBING IN THIS AREA, ALSO.  LOOKING FURTHER, I FOUND INSULATION THAT MICE HAD MOVED FROM AN UNKNOWN AREA, TO MAKE THEIR NEST.  WITH SOME DIFFICULTY, I FINALLY RECEIVED A CALL FROM A HONDA REP, IN CALIFORNIA.  AFTER ABOUT 25 MINUTES OF DISCUSSION, IN A PEACEFUL MANNER, I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY SOLUTION TO THE MICE PROBLEM, AS I WAS TRYING TO GET HONDA TO HELP ME DETERMINE WHERE THE POINT OF ENTRY WAS LOCATED AT, IN THE CAR BODY, THAT WOULD ALLOW MICE TO GAIN ENTRY.  AS A FORMER AUTO MECHANIC, & A STRUCTURE AIRCRAFT MECHANIC, I PLANNED TO MAKE THE REPAIR MYSELF.  (THE INSULATION MOVEMENT COULD BE AFFECTING THE A/C & HEATING SYSTEMS, ALSO).  LATER, I FOUND BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE LEFT CLEARANCE LIGHT HAD BEEN CHEWED COMPLETELY THROUGH, WIRE & ALL.  I LATER READ ON A WEB SITE, THAT THE WIRING INSULATION WAS MADE OUT OF RECYCLED FOOD MATERIAL, SUCH AS THE HUSKS FROM CORN, OR PODS FROM MATURE DRIED BEANS!!  I CONSIDER  THE WINDSHIELD WASHER PROBLEM A SAFETY HAZARD, FOR SURE.  OTHER MFG OF ASIAN CARS COULD BE USING FOOD GRADE WIRING.  IF THE MICE CAN'T BE STOPPED, THEY COULD TOTALLY DESTROY THESE NEWER TYPE CARS, LOOKING FOR SHELTER, WITH A BUILT-IN FOOD SUPPLY.  THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A FIRE HAZARD, ALSO, IN MY OPINION, DUE TO CAUSING A SHORT-CIRCUIT IN THE WIRING SYSTEMS. *TR",

I PUT UP WITH THESE BAD TIRES FOR 3 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS UNTIL MY LUCK RAN OUT THIS YEAR WHEN MY AREA RECEIVED SEVERAL SNOW STORMS.

I SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE TIRES RIGHT THEN BUT FAILED TO MAKE THE CONNECTION TO THE BAD TIRES AND BLAMED IT ON THE ROAD CONDITIONS. THE SECOND NEAR-MISS CAME THIS WEEK WHEN WE GOT A MAJOR SNOWSTORM AND MY BROTHER'S HOUSE LOST POWER AND HEAT. THE DAY AFTER THE STORM I TRIED TO DRIVE TO MY BROTHER'S HOUSE AND RESCUE HIM AND HIS FAMILY. I GOT JUST OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY ONTO THE SNOW COVERED STREET AND RIGHT AWAY GOT STUCK. I WAS ONLY ABLE TO MOVE MY CAR BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY BY THROWING DIRT UNDER ALL THE TIRES TO GET TRACTION. I PULLED BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND WAS AFRAID TO TRY AGAIN FOR 2 DAYS UNTIL THE SNOW SOFTENED UP A BIT.    KEEP IN MIND THAT MY CRV IS ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND THE TIRES HAD LESS THAN 25,000 MILES ON THEM AND WERE NOT WORN OUT. IN BOTH CASES THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE WAS USELESS AND IN BOTH CASES LIVES WERE AT RISK. I PAID EXTRA TO GET THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE VERSION FOR JUST SUCH OCCASIONS AND I FEEL LET DOWN, TO SAY THE LEAST.    TODAY BEING THE FIRST TIME I COULD GET TO A MAIN ROAD (BARELY) I HEADED TO THE NEAREST TIRE SHOP TO REPLACE THE HORRIBLE BRIDGESTONE H/T'S WITH BRIDGESTONE ALENZA'S, THEIR HIGHEST RATED TIRE FOR MY VEHICLE.

THESE VEHICLES MAY NOT BE SET TO OPERATE ON AUTO ON LAMPS. THIS LEADS TO THE ASSUMPTION BY THE DRIVER THAT THE HEADLAMPS AND TAIL LAMPS ARE ON WHEN REALLY THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE. AFTER NOTICING THIS HAPPEN ON A LOT OF HONDA/TOYOTA/NISSAN CARS OF IN TRAFFIC, I WONDERED WHY THEY HAVE NOT RECALLED SUCH VEHICLES YET. WOULD THERE BE THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE A REQUIREMENT FOR THESE AUTOMAKERS TO PLACE A WARNING LIGHT TO WARN THEM IN THESE SITUATIONS? IT SEEMS THAT AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN MAKES DON?T HAVE THIS ISSUE. THE PROBLEM ALSO AFFECTS VEHICLES OF JAPANESE NAMEPLATES THAT HAVE DAYTIME RUNNING LAMPS. THIS LOW INTENSITY BEAM ALSO GIVES THE DRIVER THE SENSE THAT THE LAMPS ARE ON, WHEN THEY ARE AT A LOW LEVEL, AND THE REAR TAIL LAMPS ARE ACTUALLY OFF. I HAVE SEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES, WITH DRLS AFTER DUSK WHEN IS IT NOT CLEAR TO THE DRIVER THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.

AND I WAS ONLY ABLE TO TELL FROM THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE BY TOGGLING THE SWITCH ON/OFF, BECAUSE THERE IS NO FEEDBACK FROM THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER WHEN THESE LAMPS ARE ON OR OFF.

THE COMPRESSOR OF THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR BY THIS MINOR COLLISION AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  MY AUTO INSURANCE HAD TO PAY FOR THIS.  THE COLLISION SHOP MANAGER SAID HE'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THAT - HE ASKED ME IF THIS WAS A HIGH SPEED COLLISION (IT WAS NOT), THEN ASKED ME IF THE CAR I WAS PUSHED INTO HAD A TRAILER HITCH STICKING OUT (IT HAD NOTHING STICKING OUT).   I NOW AM READING NUMEROUS CONSUMER COMPLAINTS BY PEOPLE ABOUT THE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR IN THIS CAR IN WHICH THE DEALER STATED THAT THE COMPRESSOR WAS DAMAGED BY A \"PEBBLE\" FROM THE ROAD.

DURING JULY 2007 WE LEFT THE CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR THREE WEEKS FOR THEM TO TRY AND RE-CREATE THE PROBLEM, THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO SO. THE DEALERSHIP CONSULTED WITH THE HONDA TECH-LINE AND THEY COULD STILL NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. DURING THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS WE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM OCCURRING MORE THAN 15 TIMES TO DIFFERENT DRIVERS OF THE VEHICLE.

ONCE THE CAR STARTED I DROVE FOR TWO MILES AND THEN IT JUST CUT-OUT.

ALAS, I BEGAN NOTICING SOME IRREGULARITIES WITH THE CAR SOON THEREAFTER. TO NAME BUT A FEW, THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:   1)  A TAPPING SOUND IN THE BACK OF MY CAR;  2)  A WET SPOT NOTED ON THE FLOOR OF MY GARAGE UNDER THE HOOD AREA;  3)  INTERMITTENT INABILITY TO START THE CAR WHEREBY THE BATTERY LIGHT WOULD COME ON; AND  4)  INABILITY TO ACCELERATE, BUT SUDDEN SURGE THEREAFTER WHEN DRIVING.  I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN TO BE SERVICED ON MONDAY, AUGUST 13, 2007.    LATER THAT AFTERNOON I RECEIVED A CALL FROM SF HONDA, THE SERVICE DEALER, TO ADVISE THAT:     1) THE TAPPING SOUND IN THE BACK OF MY CAR IS DUE TO A WELDING DEFECT.  HAVING JACKED UP THE CAR AND REMOVED ALL THE BACK PANELS TO THE VEHICLE, THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE DEFECTIVE WELD OR WELDS WERE LOCATED FURTHER WITHIN THE VEHICLE AND MY CAR WOULD NEED TO BE SENT TO AN AUTO BODY SHOP TO BE FURTHER STRIPPED APART TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF DEFECTIVE WELDS IN QUESTION.       2) A POWDER TEST PERFORMED ON MY ENGINE HAD DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A TRANSMISSION LEAK AND THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.     3) THEY HAD YET TO DETERMINE WHY MY CAR WOULD FAIL TO START AND THE BATTERY LIGHT APPEAR; AND     4) THE SUDDEN SURGING OF MY VEHICLE ONCE I HAD STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR WAS DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE LEAK IN THE TRANSMISSION.     UPON HEARING THIS, I WAS FLABBERGASTED.  WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A BRAND-NEW CAR, A HONDA WHICH IS NOTED FOR ITS RELIABILITY, WOULD ENCOUNTER SUCH PROBLEMS?  AND AT 3,158 MILES?

UNFORTUNATELY, THE CAR IS NOT PERFORMING WITHIN THESE NUMBERS, THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE CONTACTED YOU ALREADY AND GOT THIS CASE NUMBER. NOW, AFTER DRIVING THE CAR FOR ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AND OVER 2,500 MILES THE ACTUAL MPG IS STILL MUCH LOWER THAN ADVERTISED. THE OVERALL MPG IS AROUND 17/MPG (WHICH IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE 25/MPG ADVERTISED BY HONDA, IN FACT IT IS AROUND 45% LESS THEN ADVERTISED), THE ACTUAL MPG FOR THE HIGHWAY IS LITTLE OVER 22 MPG (AGAIN NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE MPG ADVERTISED WHICH IS 28 MPG, IN FACT IT IS 30% LOWER) AND THE ACTUAL MPG IN THE CITY IS AROUND 15 MPG (AGAIN NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE 22 MPG ADVERTISED, IN FACT IT IS 40% LOWER THEN ADVERTISED). THIS IS A CLEAR CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING FROM HONDA. WE WENT TO OURISMAN HONDA AND THEY DID SOME CHECKS, WHICH ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE. THEY DROVE THE CAR ONCE ON THE HIGHWAY TO GET THE MILEAGE FOR THE HIGHWAY, WHICH WAS LITTLE OVER 22 MPG. WE DON'T DISPUTE THE FACT THAT THE MILEAGE ON THE HIGHWAY IS BETTER THEN IN THE CITY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DO LIVE IN THE CITY AND THIS IS OUR MAIN PLACE FOR DRIVING OUR CAR.

THE DEALER ALSO MENTIONED THE 5000 MILES ?BREAK-IN PERIOD, AFTER WHICH WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE REAL MPG. TO BEGIN WITH, NOBODY MENTIONED THAT BEFORE WE BOUGHT THE CAR. SECOND, IT IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE OFFICIAL HONDA BROCHURES, WHICH CAME WITH THE CAR. IF WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS BREAK IN PERIOD, WE WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

(6) THE INSPECTOR HAD FAILED TO FIND THE PROBLEM. [IT WAS MADE DEFECTIVE IN FACTORY.]   (7) THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS POOR. ON 11/17/2006, WE WERE LET WAITING TILL AFTER ALMOST AN HOUR HAD PASSED, AND THE HONDA MAIN OFFICE WAS CONTACTED.   (8) THEY WERE UNWILLING TO SATISFY OUR REQUEST [THEY REFUSED TO REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER ONE]. NEITHER HONDA AND DEALERSHIP, THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE CARE OF US.   (9) ALSO THEY WANT TO MAKE PROFIT BY TAKING IT BACK FOR LESS THAN WE HAD PAY FOR.         *JB",
