THE ELECTRIC STARTER IS INSUFFICIENT TO RESTART THE ENGINE REQUIRING THE RIDER TO USE THE KICK STARTER TO RESTART THE ENGINE. IT IS COMMON FOR THE MOTORCYCLE'S FRONT WHEEL TO LIFT OFF THE GROUND WHEN ACCELERATING FORWARD FROM A DEAD STOP (WHEELIE), CAUSING A LOSS OF STEERING AND CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE MOTORCYCLE HAVING A LARGE SIZE ENGINE WITH A SMALL VEHICLE FRAME AND AN AUTOMATIC CLUTCH THAT PROVIDES LESS CONTROL THAN A MANUAL CLUTCH. THE MOTORCYCLE WOULD NOT PASS A STATE SAFETY INSPECTION DUE TO AN INSUFFICIENT FRONT BRAKE.",
