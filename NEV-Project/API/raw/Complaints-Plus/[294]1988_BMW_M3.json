MY CAR EXHIBITS ALL THE SIGNS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL NOTICE. IT HAS WHITE COOLANT RESIDUE AROUND ALL THE COOLANT HOSES AND THE RADIATOR SEAMS. I FEAR THAT THERE MAY BE A LEAK AT ANY TIME. THIS HAS EXISTED FOR SOMETIME BUT UNTIL I READ THE RECALL NOTICE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THE RADIATOR WAS REPLACED IN 1991 FOR LEAKAGE. BUT THE WHITE RESIDUE REAPPEARED AGAIN SHORTLY AFTER.",
