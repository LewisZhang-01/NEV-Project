About halfway or less since last oil change mileage wise from what I recall. Checked oil and about halfway between bottom and top markers on dipstick. Took to dealer Monday (.8 miles from home). Oil light did not come back on. Dropped off. Dealer said light came on shortly after driving. Said problem could be caused by \u201caftermarket\u201d oil filter aka not a OEM filter. Said would do oil & filter change to see if resolved. Yesterday (Thursday) said oil & filter change complete & oil light not on. Reiterated previously mentioned concern of engine failure and potential accident. Service advisor said hyundai will not entertain engine replacement unless oil consumption gets documented. Oil consumption test to be completed after 1000 miles or until low oil levels noticed/oil pressure light illuminates. Will pick up tomorrow to see what happens. Engine is covered under newly extended warranty if failure occurs.  Service advisor says nothing else was checked internally, spark plugs, etc. as this would incur engine being taken apart and extra charges prior to hyundai \u201centertains\u201d covering engine replacement etc.   Although no failure has occurred yet I\u2019m worried something will and it will result in something potentially catastrophic for not only the engine/car but myself.",

They stated there is no open recalls for this vehicle, and that I should go back if the noise increases.

I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I DIDN'T SEEM TO LOSE POWER AT CRUISING SPEEDS, BUT IT WAS STILL OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. I LIMPED IT THE 20 OR SO MILES TO MY LOCAL SERVICE CENTER WHERE IT'S NOW SITTING. FIRST THING THEY DID WAS CHECK THE DIP STICK AND IT WAS DRY. I HAVE MY OIL CHANGED REGULARLY, I'VE NEVER HAD BLUE SMOKE OUT THE BACK, NO OIL SPOTS, NO SIGN OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST OIL LEAK. SO FOR THE DIP STICK TO BE DRY WAS ALARMING.    I SPENT THE NEXT DAY CALLING AROUND TO HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS TO SEE WHAT OPTIONS I'D HAVE. I COMMUTE ABOUT 70 MILES FOR WORK, MY TUCSON IS AT 130K MILES SO IT'S WELL BEYOND THE 100K WARRANTY.

I THOUGH IT WAS A STRANGE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION BUT FIGURED IT WAS A ONE TIME OCCURRENCE.  THIS HAPPEN ON SEPTEMBER 9TH OF 2016.  SINCE THEN, THE CAR HAS DIED WHILE IN MOTION 4 MORE TIMES, BECOMING MORE FREQUENT AFTER EACH OCCURRENCE.  I TOOK MY CAR IN TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND THEY KEPT IT OVERNIGHT.  I ALREADY HAD SOMEONE AT AN ADVANCED AUTO PARTS STORE TEST MY BATTERY, ALTERNATOR AND STARTER, AND ALL OF THOSE CHECKED OUT FINE.  I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WHENEVER THE CAR DID DIE WHILE I WAS DRIVING, THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT IT WAS GOING TO DIE AND NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON BEFORE AFTER IT WOULD DIE.  THE VEHICLE WOULD ALWAYS START UP AGAIN AFTER WAITING A FEW MINUTES.  I HAVE BEEN LUCKY THAT EACH TIME IT HAS HAPPENED I WAS NOT ON THE HIGHWAY OR IN ANY DANGER OF HITTING SOMEONE, BUT I GUESS I WAS JUST LUCKY FOR THAT.  AFTER TESTING THE CAR, I WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND THEIR TESTING OF THE COMPUTER REVEALED THAT NO PROBLEMS HAD OCCURRED.  THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO NO WARNING LIGHTS COMING ON WHEN IT HAPPENED SO WHEN THEY TESTED IT, NOTHING APPEARED SAYING THE CAR HAD DIED.  THEY WERE TOTALLY FINE WITH GIVING ME THE CAR BACK AFTER NOT BEING ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM THEY ARE ALLOWING ME TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A DANGEROUS VEHICLE.

ANOTHER HAD ME COME IN THE NEXT DAY BUT WAS TOLD THE CAR DID SHOW THE LIGHTS SO THEY CLEARED THE COMPUTER AND RESET IT BUT THEY COULD DO NOTHING MORE UNLESS THE LIGHTS CAME BACK ON.  I COULD BRING THE CAR BACK WHEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  I WAS NO SOONER OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP AND THE STEERING WENT AND THE LIGHTS CAME BACK ON - I TURNED AROUND AND HEADED BACK - JUST I GOT THERE THE LIGHTS WENT OFF AND THE STEERING WAS NORMAL SO I DID NOT GO BACK IN.

SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR, I NOTICED A STRONG VIBRATION THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM UNBALANCED TIRES.   I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEY FOUND IT WAS UNBALANCED AND PROCEEDED TO BALANCE THE CAR. HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I STILL NOTICED A SLIGHT VIBRATION WHEN I DROVE THE CAR, AND IT WAS ESPECIALLY BAD AT 50MPH. I TOOK IT BACK FOR A SECOND TIME TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND THEY BALANCED THE CAR AGAIN, BUT ONLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT. AGAIN, BALANCING THE TIRES MADE NO DIFFERENCE.   I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER FOR A THIRD TIME AND RODE IN THE CAR WITH THE LEAD MECHANIC AT THAT LOCATION. HE ALSO NOTICED THE VIBRATION AND ASKED I LEAVE THE CAR WITH HIM. HE THEN TESTED ONE OF THE OTHER TUCSONS ON THEIR LOT THAT WAS THE SAME TRIM MODEL AND HAD THE SAME TIRES. HE REQUESTED I GO WITH HIM IN THAT CAR, AND WE FELT THE SAME VIBRATION AS IN MY CAR. HE DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE. ON COLD MORNINGS, THE CAR VIBRATES SO BADLY IT CHATTERS MY TEETH AND FEELS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT WILL ONLY CONTINUE GET WORSE WITH TIME, CAUSING PERMANENT DAMAGE. EVEN THOUGH THE CAR HAS A GREAT WARRANTY, I STILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING IT AND AM RELUCTANT TO TAKE IT ON LONG TRIPS. I CURRENTLY HAVE A CASE OPEN WITH HYUNDAI MOTORS USA. THE CASE WAS OPENED IN MARCH OF 2014 AND HYUNDAI FEELS IT CAN BE SOLVED BY REPLACING THE TIRES. I HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET AS THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME COUPONS FOR THE FULL PRICE OF THE TIRES. THE VIBRATION HAS STARTED TO GROW NOTICEABLY WORSE AND I AM CONCERNED FOR BOTH MY SAFETY AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE THE SAME CAR.   *TR",
