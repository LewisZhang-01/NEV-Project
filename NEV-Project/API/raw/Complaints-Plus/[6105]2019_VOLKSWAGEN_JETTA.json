I had to pay $750 to the body shop and it was repaired. All Summer, Spring, and Fall, it was fine. Well It happened again on the same side and almost exactly 1 year later from the first one. Took it Volkswagen after speaking Customer Service as an elevated evaluation. I was there for 2 hours, the conclusion again is that \"It's an OUTSIDE INFLUENCE\" I have done a lot of research  and found that other makes and models have had this happen as well. All the other car makers gave the stock answer \"OUTSIDE INFLUENCE\"!  How does this happen twice to the same car. I am on Disability, and hardly drive. Right now I only have 8 thousand miles on the car. I go to the supermarket park in handicap and come home and park in handicap. There is something wrong with this car and I'm afraid that something may catch on fire.  The only other thing I can think of is that it has something to do with the main heater and defroster for the whole car. It got very cold here and I had to use both the heated and defroster. Now it has almost completely melted.  --  [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

        "summary": "2019 VW Jetta SE 1.4 tsi *82000 miles  *regular car maintenance  There is a weird grinding/ whirring  noise when accelerating around 1500-2500 rpm id say 2ed or 3ed gear so around 25-35mph. I havent got any warning lights and from what i can read online from numerous others with the same year make and model i have this is a known problem. Ive tried getting it into the dealership but they keep telling me they dont have any loaner cars for me to use because 2021 customer's are priority reason for the loaner is because it takes 3 days for them to be able to proform a full diagnosic on the car but i have took the car to the VW dealer in union city ga 2 times the first time they said the noise was the turbo wastegate and after 8 long hours in the waiting room i get the car back and the dar after the noise is back (on the paper from them the part number isnt a wastegate repair its a boost sensor and my research shows the turbo that VW puts on the car dont make just the wastegate to repair the whole turbo has to be replaced) the second time i took it up there for the same problem they lied about having a loaner car and made me waste a hour drive and gas and i had to ask for the day off to do this. The safty issue  concerned with is that when this noise happens its like the car has low power the the specified rpm/mph and when it passes that threshold it takes off and jerks my head back to the headrest reguardless how much the gas pedal is being pushed with the sudden power it could cause me to rear end someone. Another thing im concerned about is that this problem could be due to another car component failing witch could become something serious to be a newer car i dont believe this should be happening ive tried to get it seen about and have had nothing but problems and feel like its getting worse is there anything that could be done to get this looked at and again there are numerous reports online about the same exact problem im having with the 2019 VW jetta se 1.4tsi",

VOLKSWAGEN'S SUGGESTED RESOLUTION IS TO PERMANENTLY DISENGAGE THE FRONT-ASSIST SAFETY FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT EXPOSES THE VEHICLE'S OCCUPANTS TO OTHER SAFETY HAZARDS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE AVOIDED WITH AN ENGAGED FRONT-ASSIST SYSTEM.

HOWEVER, ON 3 OCCASIONS, THIS MALFUNCTION WAS EXTRAORDINARY, WHERE THE ENGINE RPM SOARED VERY HIGH AND THE CLUTCH DID NOT SEEM TO FULLY DISENGAGE.

VW OF AMERICA'S RESPONSE; 'OPERATOR ERROR' ' NOT A WARRANTY CONCERN.  POINT OF REFERENCE:  I HAVE OWNED / OPERATED 8 CARS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSION OVER THE PAST 43 YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF OVER 700,000 MILES OF DRIVING.  I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO SERVICE A CLUTCH UNDER 100,000 MILES OF SERVICE.  THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THIS MALFUNCTION, AS IT ONLY OCCURRED A FEW TIMES EACH MONTH.  VW OF AMERICA AGREES IT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE A CLUTCH WEAR SO QUICKLY, BUT ALSO BELIEVES IT IS DUE TO THE WAY I DRIVE THE CAR AND NOT COVERED BY THEIR WARRANTY.  90% OF MY DRIVING IS ON A 30 MILE (INTERSTATE) SEGMENT BETWEEN MY HOME AND O'HARE AIRPORT (I AM AN AIRLINE PILOT).
