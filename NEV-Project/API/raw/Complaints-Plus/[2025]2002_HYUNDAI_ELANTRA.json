SHORTLY AFTERWARD, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE ABOUT THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND TOOK MY CAR IN TO HAVE IT SERVICED. INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE PARTS, HYUNDAI DRILLED A HOLE FOR WATER TO ESCAPE AND PUT A WAX COATING ON THE CONTROL ARMS, WHICH WOULD LATER WEAR OFF. AFTER RECEIVING MY CAR BACK, I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE AN ISSUE WITH THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS, AS I DO NOT RECALL BEING TOLD IN PERSON NOR IN WRITING THAT I SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF SAID PARTS. ADDITIONALLY, AFTER REVIEWING MY RECEIPT, IT DOES NOT STATE ANYTHING ABOUT FURTHER MAINTENANCE OF THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS. ON MARCH 5, 2013 WHILE TRAVELING ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE, A MAJOR HIGHWAY, MY DRIVER SIDE LOWER CONTROL ARM BROKE IN HALF, ALMOST CAUSING ME TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT. AFTER HAVING MY CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC, HE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM WITH THE CONTROL ARM AND RECOMMENDED THAT I HAVE IT TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP TO BE REPAIRED. IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH HYUNDAI EMPLOYEES, HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP EMPLOYEES, AND MY OWN MECHANIC, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. THUS IT IS VERY DISCONCERTING AS A CONSUMER AND A HUMAN BEING TO KNOW THAT HYUNDAI  HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE DEFECT AND THE FACT THAT THE RECALL WAS NOT A COMPLETE FIX, AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION, WHEREBY PUTTING MANY PEOPLES' LIVES IN DANGER.I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL OWNERS OF THESE CARS BE CONTACTED TO WARN THEM ABOUT THE SAFETY HAZARDS THEY POSSESS.  *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY LOST CONTROL OF MY CAR, BUT WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT.  AT THAT TIME, I DISCOVERED THE FRONT AXLE HAD ACTUALLY BROKEN (PASSENGER SIDE) AND WAS DRAGGING THE GROUND.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT MY CAR FROM (A 2002 HYUNDAI ELANTRA- I CONTACTED FIRST TEAM AUTO MALL WHERE I HAD BOUGHT IT NEW), AND ADVISED THE SERVICE PERSONNEL OF WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED.  THEY ADVISED THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT MY CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS, SO I HAD IT TOWED TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP.  I PAID $632.89 TO REPLACE THE LOWER CONTROL ARM, INCLUDING SWAY BAR/LINK KIT AND RE-ALIGNMENT.  ON 09/28/10 I FOUND A LINK ONLINE TO A WEBSITE DETAILING MULTIPLE RECALLS FOR 2002-2003 HYUNDAI ELANTRAS- RECALLS HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED IN SEVERAL AREAS NEAR ME, BUT NOT IN MY PARTICULAR STATE.  THE RECALL INVOLVED ROAD SALT CAUSING CORROSION TO THE LOWER CONTROL ARM, WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE TO BREAKAGE.  THE REPAIR SHOP I TOOK MY CAR TO THAT DAY COULD NOT TELL ME HOW THE DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED; THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE.  I ALSO NOTICED ON 09/28/10 A RECALL REGARDING LEAKAGE OF BRAKE FLUID; I HAVE HAD TO REFILL THE BRAKE FLUID IN MY CAR TWICE IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS (I HAD NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE MAY OF THIS YEAR AND I'VE HAD THE CAR SINCE 2002).  I AGAIN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, WHO ADVISED ME THERE ARE NO RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE.  OBVIOUSLY, THE PROBLEMS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALLS ARE HAPPENING/HAVE HAPPENED TO MY CAR, AND POSSIBLY OTHER CARS IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA.  I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE RE-EVALUATE THE RECALL CRITERIA AND EXPAND THE RECALL TO INCLUDE ANY AND ALL VEHICLES THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE AFFECTED.  IF I HAD BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE ON THE DAY MY LOWER CONTROL ARM BROKE, THE DAMAGE WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE KILLED ME AND ANY OTHER MOTORIST UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE NEAR ME AT THE TIME. *TR",

LAST WEEK I NOTICED SOME \"PLAY\" IN MY WHEEL AND PLANNED TO GET AN ALIGNMENT DONE THIS WEEK. ON THURSDAY NIGHT ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK MY CAR SPUN OUT OF CONTROL AND MY WHEELS WENT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.  LUCKILY I WAS TURNING DOWN A ROAD VERY CLOSE TO MY HOME SO I WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 15 MPH, MY 6 AND 3 YR OLDS WEREN'T WITH ME, AND NO OTHER CARS WERE COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OR THIS COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.   I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE LOCAL GUY WHO INFORMED ME THAT MY LOWER CONTROL ARMS WERE BAD (ONE RUSTED AND BROKEN, THE OTHER WITH HOLES) AND THAT THIS WAS LIKELY A RECALL ITEM AND I SHOULD CONTACT MY DEALERSHIP RATHER THAN PAY HIM FOR REPAIRS THAT MIGHT BE COVERED (VERY NICE GUY). I FOUND OUT THIS IS A RECALL ITEM.  BOTH HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND GRAPPONE HYUNDAI LET ME KNOW I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THE TOW (IT WAS $125) TO GET MY CAR THERE, AND FOR A RENTAL VEHICLE WHILE MY CAR WAS OUT OF COMMISSION. I HAD THE CAR TOWED THERE ON FRIDAY AS QUICKLY AS I COULD. I CALLED THIS MORNING AT 9AM TO FIND OUT HOW LONG I NEED TO GET A RENTAL FOR AND AFTER WAITING FOR ABOUT 20 RINGS SOMEONE FINALLY PICKED UP THE PHONE AND LET ME KNOW THAT NOBODY WOULD EVEN LOOK AT MY CAR UNTIL MONDAY AND THAT I SHOULD PLAN ON PAYING FOR A RENTAL FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.   THIS WILL BE THE LAST HYUNDAI I OWN AND I'M VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT A DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE KILLED ME (I TAKE THE HIGHWAY HOME MOST NIGHTS AND JUST LOST A SISTER IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN JUNE) NOW IS GOING GO COST ME HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.  I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN MY HYUNDAI AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT A DEFECT IS COSTING ME SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY. *TR",

I PULLED THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRST AVAILABLE TURN OFF, WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A CHURCH PARKING LOT.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD A FLAT TIRE, BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION I NOTICED THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL WAS TILTED INWARD ON ALMOST A 45 DEGREE ANGLE SO THAT THE HUB CAP WAS ALMOST IN CONTACT WITH THE PAVEMENT. I WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM MY HOUSE AND WAS BARELY ABLE TO GET THE CAR BACK HOME WITH OUT SWERVING ALL OVER THE ROAD TRYING TO STEER. UPON INSPECTION BY A MECHANIC, WHO HAD TO COME TO MY HOME, THERE WAS A LOT OF RUST UNDERNEATH THE CAR, ESPECIALLY ON THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS. I WENT ONLINE TO RESEARCH HOW MUCH IT MIGHT COST TO FIX AND FOUND THAT IT HAD BEEN A RECALL WITH HYUNDAI, HOWEVER I NEVER GOT THE RECALL NOTICE. WHEN I CALLED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO INQUIRE, THEY CLAIMED THEY DIDN'T HAVE MY ADDRESS AND THEREFORE I NEVER RECEIVED THE RECALL. I BOUGHT THE CAR USED IN 2004, IT IS NOW 2009, I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY EXCUSE AS TO WHY THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD MY ADDRESS AND TO WHY I DID NOT RECEIVE A RECALL. SOMEONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. HYUNDAI WILL ONLY COVER THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND NOTHING ELSE. NONE OF THE DAMAGE CAUSED BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE IS COVERED AND I CAN'T EVEN GET A RENTAL. I NEED NEW TIRES AND NEW HUB CAPS, THERE IS A HOLE IN MY RESONATOR FROM HITTING THE CURB WHEN I VEERED OFF THE ROAD, THERE ARE SCRATCHES ON MY REAR AND A CRACKED BACK HEADLIGHT FROM THE ONCOMING CAR BRUSHING AGAINST MY REAR. HAD I GOTTEN THE RECALL NOTICE, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED! THE ROOT CAUSE IS POOR MANUFACTURING, ALL OTHER DAMAGES DUE TO THIS SHOULD BE REIMBURSED WITH OUT ANY HASSLE BECAUSE HYUNDAI SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THEY HAVE NOT KILLED ANYONE YET. *TR",

BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK (7/08) AND THEN WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE THREE \"ERROR\" READINGS THAT WERE RELATED TO THE FUEL LINE.  AFTER SPEAKING TO A COMBATIVE SERVICE TECH, I EXPLAINED THAT THEY DID SOMETHING AND THEY NEEDED TO FIX IT, AS THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON PRIOR TO THEIR TECH \"FIXING\" OUR CAR.   SUDDENLY, AFTER I EXPLAINED THAT IF IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY THEN THEY ARE NOT CHARGING ME AGAIN FOR SERVICES THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE THE FIRST TIME (UNDER WARRANTY IN MY OPINION).  IT WAS AMAZING THAT THE CAR WAS READY TO GO WITH NO OTHER NEEDED SERVICE AND THE \"ERROR\" LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER DETECTED.  HOWEVER, TWO DAYS LATER 7/31/08, OUR CAR WAS TO BE SERVICED AGAIN BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL NOT GOING OFF.  NOW, AFTER HAVING AN SMOG CHECK, OUR CAR DID NOT PASS INSPECTION DUE TO:FAILED - EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS CONTROL SYSTEM DETECTED - GROSS LEAK.  EMISSIONS SHOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY AND NOW THE DEALER - PLANET HYUNDAI, LAS VEGAS, IS REFUSING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THAT HAS OCCURRED WHILE THEIR TECH \"FIXED\" THE FUEL LINE PROBLEM.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT AFTER READING SEVERAL OTHER CASES LIKE THIS THAT THE FUEL LINE SPILLAGE IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL. *TR",
