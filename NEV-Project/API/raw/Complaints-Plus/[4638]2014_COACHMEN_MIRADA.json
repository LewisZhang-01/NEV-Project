WE TOOK THE RV TO A REPAIR SHOP AND THEY DIAGNOSED PROBLEM AS KING PINS (SUSPENSION) ON OUR FORD F53 CHASSIS. KING PINS HELP HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND NORMALLY LAST 175,000 MILES. KNOWING THIS WE WANTED A SECOND OPINION SO TOOK THE RV TO A DIFFERENT MECHANIC WHO CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM IS THE KING PINS. I RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND 7 CASES WITH SAME PROBLEM ON RV CHAT ROOMS SO I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY. WE WERE AT THAT TIME A FEW WEEKS OVER 5 YEAR WARRANTY.  FORD GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND AND SAID MY RV DEALERSHIP DIDN'T FILE AN EXTENDED SALE WARRANTY DATE AND IT TAKES ONE MONTH TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM AFTER RECEIVING CHANGE ORDER. AFTER WE WAITED A MONTH FORD SAYS THEY WON'T HELP PAY FOR THE $2,200 JOB BECAUSE OUR FIRST CLAIM WITH THEM WAS CLOSED AND THEY'D HAVE TO START THE CLAIM TODAY WHICH IS 2 MONTHS OVER WARRANTY.",
