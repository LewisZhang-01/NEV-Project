THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED AS THE MANUFACTURE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED AND REFUSES TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I'M NOT THE FIRST OWENER. THE TRAILER WAS MADE IN MARCH OF 2007 BY CONTINENTAL TRAILERS AT 9200 NW 58TH STREET MIAMI FLORIDA 33178. PH (305) 594-1022. I FEEL THAT EVEN IF THEY DO NOT FIX MY TRAILER THAT THIS A VERY REAL SAFETY PROBLEM. THE FLEXING OF THE TRAILER CAUSED ONLY MINOR SCRAPING OF THE PAINT, BUT ANYONE WITH A TRAILER LIKE THIS COULD WELL LOSE CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE, BOAT AND TRAILER THEREBY PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT RISK.",
