SHORTLY AFTER MY FINAL SERVICE FOR THE VIBRATION ISSUE I REPORTED ABNORMAL SHIFTING DURING ACCELERATION AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE SHIFTING TRAINED TO THE DRIVER.  THE ABNORMAL SHIFTING NEVER RESOLVED ITSELF.  PERIODICALLY THE WARNING FOR SERVICE STABILITRACK AND TRACTION CONTROL PRESENTS AND THE TRAVERSE PERFORMS ROUGHLY.

THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AS WELL SINCE IT CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH YOUR STEERING AS WELL AS TIRE FUNCTIONALITY.  WHY ARE THE YEARS PAST 2011 BEING DISMISSED? I WAS INFORMED BY BOTH OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THE ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR GM THAT OUR VIN IS NOT INCLUDED. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT.

MY DAUGHTER JUST TURNED 1 A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IS ABLE TO RELEASE THE STRAPS IN THIS CAR SEAT HERSELF.  SHE RESTS HER FEET ON THE RED BUTTON AND WITH THE ROAD MOVEMENT OF THE CAR AND HER WIGGLING AROUND, SHE IS ABLE TO LOOSEN THE SEAT ENOUGH TO GET HER ARM OUT OF THE STRAP.  IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH FORCE WHATSOEVER TO PUSH DOWN ON THE BUTTON TO CAUSE THE STRAPS TO LOOSEN.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME SHE HAS LOOSENED HERSELF FROM THIS SEAT.  THE BUTTON IS FULLY EXPOSED WITH NO COVERING IN AN AREA THAT CHILDREN REST THEIR FEET.  AFTER VISITING SEVERAL CAR SEAT RETAILERS, I NOTED THAT BRITAX B SAFE INFANT SEAT WAS THE ONLY CAR SEAT THAT DID NOT HAVE A COVERING OVER THE RELEASE BUTTON.  I HAVE PHOTOS OF THOSE CAR SEATS IF NEEDED. EVEN BRITAX'S OWN CONVERTIBLE SEATS AT LEAST HAVE A LIP OVER THE BUTTON TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM RELEASING IT.  EVERY SINGLE CAR SEAT I CAME ACROSS EITHER HAD THE RELEASE BUTTON UNDER THE PADDING, HAD A PLASTIC LIP THAT EXTENDED OVER THE BUTTON, OR WAS POSITIONED IN A WAY THAT A CHILD COULD NOT RELEASE IT (MUCH LESS AN INFANT).   THIS CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN AND SAFETY FEATURE THAT WAS OVERLOOKED BY BRITAX.  BRITAX CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME MY DAUGHTER WAS TOO TALL FOR THE SEAT YET SHE FALLS UNDER THE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS OF 32 INCHES AND/OR 35 LBS.  THIS IS MY 4TH BRITAX CAR SEAT PURCHASE AND I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THEIR BRAND UP UNTIL NOW.  THE 3 OTHER SEATS I OWN ALL HAVE THE RELEASE BUTTON UNDER THE SEAT PADDING WHERE AN INFANT/CHILD CANNOT EASILY GET TO IT.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING TO KNOW THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT SAFE IN HER CAR SEAT AS I WAS DRIVING AROUND.  WE HAVE SINCE DISCONTINUED USING THIS SEAT.",

THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  I MANAGED TO GET THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE AND TURNED IT OFF.  I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IMMEDIATELY AND THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME TO TURN OFF THE TRACTION CONTROL.  THERE WAS A PUNGENT SMELL ALL INSIDE THE CAR OF GAS AND OTHER FUMES, BUT I DID NOT SEE ANY FLUIDS LEAKING FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE.  THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME TO START THE CAR WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF.  I ROLLED DOWN ALL OF THE WINDOWS TO LESSEN THE ODOR.  THE CAR STARTED AS USUAL AND I STARTED BACK DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  WITHIN 3 MILES THE CAR STOPPED AGAIN, THE SAME WARNING LIGHTS BEGAN FLASHING.  I HAD LOST SEVERAL GALLONS OF FUEL IN 3 MILES.  I GOT THE CAR TO A PARKING LOT OFF THE INTERSTATE AND IT DIED AND WOULD NOT TURN BACK OVER.  WHEN I TRIED TO GET IT TO START, THE IGNITION GOT STUCK AND WOULD NOT STOP TRYING TO TURN OVER.  THE CAR WAS LOSING FUEL AND WOULD NOT RUN AT ALL.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS A FUEL PUMP ISSUE AND THEY REPLACED THE PART SEVERAL DAYS LATER.   ON NOV. 11, 2016, AS I DROVE TO WORK THIS MORNING, I WAS AT A RED LIGHT AND WHEN  I PUSHED THE ACCELERATOR AND NOTHING HAPPENED. THE CAR BEGAN FLASHING THE EXACT SAME WARNING CODES AS IN SEPT. THE CAR WOULD GO ABOUT 5-10 MPH AND I WAS STRANDED IN A 6 LANE INTERSECTION. I TURNED OFF THE TRACTION CONTROL AND MANAGED TO GET THE CAR INTO A PARKING LOT, ONCE AGAIN.  I AM VERY LUCKY THAT I HAVE NOT HAD A SEVERE ACCIDENT WHEN THIS HAS OCCURRED.  SOMEONE IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  ALSO, THIS SAME VEHICLE'S BACKUP CAMERA WILL TURN ON WHILE I AM DRIVING DOWN THE STREET.  WHEN IT TURNS ON, THE CAR SWITCHES OUT OF DRIVE, WHILE I AM DRIVING FORWARD.
