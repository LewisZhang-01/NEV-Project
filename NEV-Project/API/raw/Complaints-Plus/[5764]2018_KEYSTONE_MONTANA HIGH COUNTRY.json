        "summary": "MY 2018, KEYSTONE MONTANA HIGH COUNTRY 385BR HAD LESS THAN 3000 MILES WHEN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE HAD SEPARATION EXPOSING THE STEEL BELT.  THE TIRES WERE RAINER TIRES F RATED FOR A UNIT WITH A GVWR OF 16K LBS.  I ONLY CARRY 800 POUNDS OF CARGO IN THE UNIT.  I REPLACED THE TIRES WITH G RATED TIRES, AND HAD THE ALIGNMENT CHECKED.  I DISCOVERED THAT THE FRONT AXLE HANGERS INSTALLED BY LIPPERT WERE OUT OF ALIGNMENT ALONG WITH THE FRONT AXLE MADE BY DEXTER TOED IN.  THE REAR AXLE ALSO TRACKS TO THE RIGHT.  AT THIS POINT LIPPERT HAS REPLACED THE AXLE HANGERS, AND WE ARE WAITING ON A NEW FRONT AXLE.  HOWEVER, I NOTICE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF KEYSTONE OWNERS SUFFERING PREMATURE TIRE FAILURES, MOST OF WHICH OCCURRED IN MOTION.  90 PERCENT OF THE ONES I HAVE HEARD OF OCCURRED WITH LOW MILEAGE ON THE UNITS.  I BELIEVE IT IS A COMBINATION OF UNDERRATED TIRES, WITH MISALIGNMENT OF AXLES AND HANGERS. THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY QUALITY INSPECTION BY KEYSTONE ON COMPONENT PARTS PRIOR TO ASSEMBLY.  WE WERE FORTUNATE TO DISCOVER THE TIRE DEFAULT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT OUR DESTINATION ON 8/23/19 AS OF THIS DATE THE UNIT HAS BEEN OUT SERVICE WAITING FOR ALL ALIGNMENT REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY.",
