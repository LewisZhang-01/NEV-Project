The equipment failure can result in the transmission not being able to engage the gears into a \"forward\" motion causing the vehicle to seemingly stall in traffic. It can also cause it to shift roughly, which could further damage equipment and pose higher safety risks to not only to me, but other drivers on the roads as well, both of which issues I mentioned have occurred to me on multiple occasions. I've recently had this issue diagnosed by an Audi technician. A \"transmission malfunction\" message also is present on the dashboard as a result of the aforementioned issues.",
