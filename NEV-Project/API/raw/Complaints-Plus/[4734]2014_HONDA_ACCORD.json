Suddenly, the car accelerated in an uncontrolled manner on its own, brakes did not work, and all warning lights on the side of the dashboard came on.\u00a0 I steered the car towards an empty area and was ready to crash it into an obstacle to bring it to a stop.\u00a0 I tried to put the car in park but despite putting it in park, the car continued its acceleration forward.  I also tried to turn off the car by hitting the start/stop button but the car would not turn off.  The car accelerated uncontrollably for at least 0.3 miles.  After this uncontrolled and automatic acceleration, the car came to a stop.  I had the car towed to the Honda dealership.   Honda dealership advisor told me that there was no recall on this model.\u00a0 However, a quick search on car message boards shows that this phenomenon of sudden and uncontrolled acceleration has been reported on 2014, and 2015 and 2016 Honda Accord model year cars as well.  Fortunately, no children or their parents in the school were injured this time.  \u00a0 I hope you will direct the Honda dealership to identify and fix the problem.\u00a0 I am afraid to drive the car without understanding the reason for this frightening experience.\u00a0     Dealership address is 675 State Avenue Emmaus PA 18049 Phone number 610-965-1365  Associate who is helping me is Michael Paxos",

After the replacement I had no issues until Sunday 3/27/2022 when I went to start my vehicle and got the grinding noise again. The cost was $550.00 to put in a new starter. Now this issue is all over Honda's website with complaints, so why hasn't anything been done about it?  The wires need to have protection on them because of corrosion caused by winter conditions in the north where there is salt used on the highways. I feel a recall should be done on these models.",

Their dealerships ought to be recommending, suggesting, or offering rust protection/rust preventative be applied when buying a new Honda (for a cost to the consumer of course).  \"Paint Protection\" that come with new Hondas, isn't going to take care of nor prevent rust issues.

The problem occurs in the engine and the engine cooling system. On these vehicles, the connecting rod bolts were not assembled properly. They were torqued improperly. This can cause the engine to suddenly lose power. It also has caused the engine to leak oil.  If this type of improper torquing causes damage to the rod bolts, it can cause the car to suddenly stop. That may increase the risk of an accident occurring. The engine leak risk can also cause a fire because of the location near the hot engine or the exhaust system\u2019s parts.   To fix this problem, Honda issued an owner notification. It then had dealers bring in the cars and replace the engine short block. These repairs began in March of 2015.   I need my vehicle to be recalled  to fix this problem",

BY THE WAY, I'VE SEEN HONDA'S STANCE THAT UP TO 1 QUART OF OIL EVERY 1000 MILES IS ACCEPTABLE, I ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE.. IT'S ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILES TO BURN THIS MUCH OIL.

AT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, I REPRODUCED THE ISSUE.  DID NOT START ON 3 OF 5 ATTEMPTS.  SERVICE TECH DIAGNOSIS WAS \"POSSIBLE BAD STARTER\".  NO WAY A STARTER SHOULD GO BAD ON A 2014 THAT IS WELL CARED FOR AND NOT USED EXTENSIVELY.  THE SOLUTION OFFERED WAS FOR ME TO PAY $900 FOR SOMETHING THAT \"MIGHT\" FIX THE ISSUE.  THEY CLAIMED TO NOT BE AWARE OF THE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH NUMBER OF 2014 ACCORDS WITH THIS ISSUE, DESPITE MANY, MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE.  GOOGLE AUTO-COMPLETE SUGGESTS \"STARTER ISSUES\" AS SOON AS YOU ENTER \"2014 HONDA ACCORD\".IN THE SEARCH BOX BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ENTRIES.  THE 2013 ACCORDS GOT RECALLED FOR FAULTY STARTER.  THE 2014 ACCORD ALREADY HAD A RECALL FOR BATTERY HOUSING.  THERE CLEARLY IS A DEFECTIVE ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THE EXTENT OF WHICH AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT ARE UNKNOWN.  IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED PERMANENTLY BY HONDA TO GET THE VEHICLE IN THE PROPER STATE WHERE IT CAN BE STARTED WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THE OPERATOR IS (DAY OR NIGHT) AND WHERE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS PROVEN SAFE FOR ALL IN THE VEHICLE.  *TR",

MY CAR HAS BEEN WELL CARED FOR, HAS 28,XXX MILES ON IT, AND IS CURRENTLY CONSUMING ENGINE OIL AT THE RATE OF ABOUT ONE QUART EVERY 3,000 MILES.  I HAVE BEEN TO WALNUT CREEK HONDA COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION, AND THEY TELL ME TO CONTINUE ADDING OIL UNTIL THE OIL CONSUMPTION RATE INCREASES TO ONE QUART EVERY 500 MILES.  ENOUGH-IS-ENOUGH!     THE INTERNET.  THE INTERNET IS FULL OF POSTINGS FROM OTHER ANGRY HONDA OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION OF UP TO ONE QUART EVERY THOUSAND MILES AND HONDA SAYS THIS IS NORMAL AND REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CORRECTING HONDAS PROBLEM.

EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION UNNECESSARILY INCREASES AIR POLLUTION AS EVIDENCED BY THE COATING OF BLACK SOOT ON THE INSIDES OF MY CARS TAIL PIPE.    CONCLUSION.  I BELIEVE THAT HONDA IS CHEATING ON THEIR EMISSIONS CERTIFICATIONS  BY DESIGNING AND BUILDING ENGINES THAT EARLY IN THEIR USEFUL LIFE DEVELOP EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION AND HONDA IS REFUSING TO CORRECT THEIR DESIGN DEFECT UNTIL IT REACHES ONE QUART OF OIL BURNED (CREATING UNNECESSARY AIR POLLUTION) EVERY 500 MILES DRIVEN.

I TYPICALLY DRIVE WITH MY MOM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND SHE OFTEN GETS ANXIETY ATTACKS. THE WIND MAKES HER FEEL BETTER AND WHEN AN EPISODE WHILE DRIVING HAPPENED, I WASN'T ABLE TO PUT HER WINDOW DOWN TO HELP HER.     THE LEFT HEADLIGHT ON THE CAR IS ALSO BROKEN. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT RIGHT AWAY SINCE THE RIGHT ONE WORKS. IN A SENSE, IT'S TERRIBLE THAT SOMETHING IN THE CAR WAS BROKEN AND THAT THERE WAS NO CAR SIGNAL TO NOTIFY ME.     WE REALIZE THAT CARS REQUIRE UPKEEP, BUT FOR A 5 YEAR OLD CAR TO HAVE THIS MANY MECHANICAL ISSUES IS RIDICULOUS.     I REALIZE THAT THESE",

I WAS AT A STOPLIGHT AND WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED, MY CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL, NOT WHILE IN DRIVE OR REVERSE. IT JUST WOULDN'T MOVE. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP. ONCE HONDA EVALUATED THE CAR AFTER CHARGING A $130 \"DIAGNOSTIC\" FEE, I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE PROBLEM WAS REFERRED TO THE DEALERSHIP'S DISTRICT(?) SERVICE MANAGER TO \"SEE WHAT HONDA WANTS TO DO ABOUT IT\". THE NEXT DAY I RECEIVED A CALL THAT THE COST OF THE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT WOULD BE $4,386.80 AND THAT HONDA WAS AGREEING TO COVER 60% OF THE COST AND I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING 40% OF THE COSTS, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $1,826.88 (INCLUDING TAXES). WHEN I ASKED WHAT SPECIFICALLY WAS WRONG WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION, I WAS SIMPLY TOLD \"HONDA DOESN'T ALLOW US TO OPEN CVT TRANSMISSIONS.\" THIS SOUNDS VERY SUSPICIOUS TO ME. I NEED MY CAR, SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO PAY THE COSTS. HOWEVER, I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT I KEEP UP WITH THE ROUTINE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND HAD THE TRANSMISSION SERVICE AS SUGGESTED AT ABOUT 50K MILES. I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW IN JULY 2014, SO IT IS ONLY 4 1/2 YEARS OLD AND HAS LESS THAN 65K MILES ON IT.

HONDA DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE ABS MODULATOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND THAT MY CAR WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE (3YRS OR 36K MILES).   THE QUOTE I RECIEVED TO REPLACE THE ABS MODULATOR FROM THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WAS $1,700.  I DECIDED TO GOOGLE ABS MODULATOR FOR HONDA ACCORD TO SEE IF THERE WERE OTHER ACCORD OWNERS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR ISSUE. UPON SEARCH FROM YOUTUBE AND HONDA FORUMS, I FOUND THERE TO BE OTHER OWNERS THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH 3 LIGHTS ILLUMINATED (ABS, VSC  AND ELECTRIC POWER STEERING) AND THE REPAIR COST IF NOT UNDER WARRANTY CAN RANGE FROM $1,300 TO AS HIGH AS $2,000 FROM WHAT I SAW OTHER HONDA ACCORD OWNERS TO REPORT.    I FEEL AS THOUGH HONDA IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR THIS OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY AND FEEL AS THOUGH THEY SOLD ME A DYSFUNCTIONAL CAR. I FEEL COMPELLED TO WRITE THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE MY CAR VALUE IS 10K AND TO REPAIR THE ABS MODULATOR I WOULD HAVE TO FORK UP NEARLY 20% OF MY CARS VALUE FOR AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE THAT WAS PERHAPS FAULTY DESIGN ON HONDAS PART.

(B) HOW LONG BEFORE IT HAPPENS AGAIN?-  KEEP IN MIND THE FIRST ONE LASTED 53,000 MILES (C) HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS? NO ANSWERS TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED; THE ONLY THING THAT WAS CLEAR WAS THAT IT WASN'T A WIDESPREAD ISSUE BECAUSE THE NHSTA OR HONDA HADN'T ISSUED ANY KIND OF TSB OR RECALL. I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEWHAT TELLING WHEN I CALLED ANOTHER DEALERSHIP, SPOKE WITH THE DESK PERSON IN SERVICE. WHILE OVER THE PHONE, EXPLAINED THE LIGHTS THAT WERE ON - THE ANSWER OF \"IT'S THE ABS MODULE\" WAS INSTANT. FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN'T \"COMMON\" OR WIDESPREAD, THIS WAS A VERY QUICK REPLY.

THEY HADN'T EVEN PUT MY CAR ON THE LIFT TO CHECK IT YET! WHEN ASKED WHY I WAS TOLD I WAS NEXT. OKAY, THEY PUT MY CAR ON THE LIFT & CHECK IT OUT; TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE; BRING IT BACK.  SERVICE MANAGER \"RUSS\" COMES OVER TO ME AND SAYS THAT THE CAR ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE. THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE HARNESS SYSTEM. HE TELLS ME THAT IT'S DUE TO CORROSION. I ASK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO FIX?  HE THEN TELLS ME THAT THE ENGINE HARNESS IS NOT COVERED UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????  HE THEN SAYS THAT IT WOULD COST $2800 TO FIX & THEY HAVE TO ORDER THE PART!  I FEEL AS THOUGH MY CAR IS BEING HELD FOR RANSOM. THIS CAR HAS ONLY 12K MILES & IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER 3 YEARS OLD.

MY MECHANIC CALLED HIS INSIDE CONTACT AT THE LOCAL DEALER AND THEY KEEP STARTERS ON HAND FOR THIS.  THEY WILL NOT HANDLE AS A WARRANTY OR 'RECALL' TYPE PROBLEM AND ONE HAS TO PAY A LOT FOR THE FIX - STARTER REPLACEMENT CAN BE CLOSE TO $1K!!  ANOTHER HONDA CONTACT KNOWS OF THIS ISSUE - IT IS BECAUSE THE STARTER ON THE ACCORD, ESPECIALLY THE 2.4L ENGINE, IS MOUNTED BELOW THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD, HEATS UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND BEGINS TO FAIL - DEPENDS MORE ON THE # OF STARTS THAN MILEAGE, APPARENTLY.  MY ACCORD IS STARTED MANY TIMES PER DAY.  THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE FIXED UNDER A RECALL EVENT, I BELIEVE, BUT I MUST GET MINE FIXED NOW!!!  NOT GOOD!    ALSO A PROBLEM FROM DAY 1, IS THE FORWARD WARNING CAMERA GETS HOT, HERE IN SOUTHERN CAL, AND WILL NOT WORK UNTIL THE AC SYSTEM COOLS IT DOWN.  VERY UNSAFE AND WORTHY OF FURTHER REVIEW AS WELL.  *JS",

ALL YOU HEAR IS THE WHINING OF THE STARTER,  I HAVE ON VIDEO.  LET VEHICLE SIT A WHILE AND TRIED LATER WITH SUCCESS.  BROUGHT VEHICLE BACK TO DEALER THE NEXT DAY, SHOWED THEM THE VIDEO.  THE TOOK VEHICLE IN AND DETERMINED EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.  THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE ISSUE WITH THE STARTER BECAUSE IT IS INTERMITTENT, OCCURRING ABOUT EVERY 3-4 DAYS. THEY SENT ME ON MY WAY.  I AM CONCERNED THAT WITH WINTER IN FULL SWING, I WILL BE STRANDED OUT IN MY CAR BECAUSE OF A FAULTY STARTER.  I AM UNCOMFORTABLE GOING ANYWHERE WITH MY VEHICLE.",

I CHECKED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID TO SEE IF THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ISSUE, HOWEVER IT WAS FULL AND CLEAN (THANKS TO REGULAR MAINTENANCE).

THEY DID OFFER TO BUY THE CAR BACK FROM ME, BUT FOR A TERRIBLE PRICE AND I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH IT AND THEY DEALERSHIP MANAGER SAID THAT THEY WOULD RESELL IT WITH CONFIDENCE AND I REFUSED TO SELL IT TO THEM IF THEY WERE GOING TO RESELL IT WITH A SERVICE CERTIFICATION.  HOW DARE THEM DO THAT!  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT.",

I WAS GIVEN 2014 HONDA ACCORD AS A LOANER VEHICLE FOR THE PERIOD MY CAR WAS GETTING FIXED AT THE DEALERSHIP. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS FOR 3 DAYS. HOWEVER, ON JAN 6TH 2015, WE HAD SNOW IN OUR AREA AND THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE WAS BELOW FREEZING. I HAD THE VEHICLE IN MY GARAGE AND WHEN I LEFT FOR WORK ON JAN 7TH, I HAD BACKED OUT THE CAR FROM THE GARAGE AND WHEN I TURNED ON TO OUR STREET, I HAD NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL A BIT STIFF. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SNOW ON THE GROUND THAT HAD MADE IT LITTLE DIFFICULT TO TURN.    AS I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE ON OUR STREET AT SPEED LESS THAN 10 MPH, I CAME TO THE FIRST TURN THAT I MAKE TO GET TO THE STREET LEADING UP TO THE MAIN STREET. AS I TRIED TO MAKE THE RIGHT TURN, I NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DIFFICULT TO TURN AND DUE TO SNOW IT STARTED SKIDDING TO MY LEFT. AT SPEED OF LESS THAN 15 MPH AND STEERING WHEEL LOCKED, THE VEHICLE SKID TO THE LEFT PAVEMENT. IT CAUSED MINOR SCRATCHES ON THE FRONT LEFT RIM AND CAUSED THE ALIGNMENT TO BE OFF.     I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AS IT WAS A LOANER VEHICLE AND DEALERSHIP PROCEEDED WITH GETTING 'FRONT SUSPENSION' AND 'STEERING GEAR & LINKAGE' REPLACED THROUGH MY INSURANCE. IT COST ME $750 AS DEDUCTIBLE COST THAT I'VE PAID TO THE DEALERSHIP. UPON RESEARCHING THIS EVENT FURTHER ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT SIMILAR COMPLAINT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR 2013 (MY LOANER VEHICLE IS 2014 MODEL) HONDA ACCORDS THAT HAD SURFACED IN NOV 2014 (HTTP://WWW-ODI.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/ACMS/CS/JAXRS/DOWNLOAD/DOC/UCM466318/INOA-PE14033-1232.PDF).

MOST TIMES OUR FCW WOULD NOT SOUND BUT SOMETIMES YOU GOT FALSE SIGNALS AND YOU WONDERED WHY. AFTER TWO DEALER VISITS AND ONE FOR 3 1/2 DAYS THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE EXCEPT NOW WE DO NOT GET FALSE SIGNALS. THE HONDA LITERATURE SAYS OF FCW \"..CAN SENSE THE PRESENCE OF VEHICLES IN FRONT OF YOU AND ISSUES ALERTS IF IT CALCULATES YOU ARE AT RISK OF A COLLISION..\" THAT IS WHY WE BOUGHT THE CAR AND WHAT WE EXPECT. AFTER THE SECOND DEALER VISIT AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE, THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER AND I DROVE OUR VEHICLE AND AT TIMES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO A VEHICLE AHEAD INCLUDING LARGE TRUCKS AND THE FCW ALARM DID NOT SOUND. WE TRIED A VERY SIMILAR NEW CAR OFF THE LOT LIKE MINE AND DROVE IT THE SAME WAY. THE FCW DID NOT WORK AS EXPECTED. PER A SHEET THE DEALER GAVE ME FOR FCW, IT STATES THAT IT USES RADAR WITH A RANGE OF UP TO 393 FT. IF A CAR IS GOING UP TO 75 MPH WITH A CAR LENGTH (20') FOR EVERY 10 MPH FCW SHOULD SOUND THE ALARM UP TO 150' AND GOING FASTER THAN THE CAR AHEAD. OURS WILL NOT DO THAT AT ANY SPEED BELOW 75 AND GETTING TOO CLOSE GOING FASTER THAN THE ONE AHEAD UNTIL GOING ABOUT 25 OR UNDER THEN NOT ALWAYS. I SAY OUR FCW DOES NOT WORK. WHEN DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE DEALER AND A FACTORY REP THE SERVICE MANAGER NOW SAYS \"IT IS YOUR PERCEPTION FCW DOES NOT WORK.\" I SAY FCW DOES NOT WORK CONSISTENTLY AND AT HIGHER SPEEDS AND BUYERS ARE BEING DECEIVED. WITH SELF DRIVING CARS AND ACC IS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HONDA TO FIX OR REPLACE OUR FCW SO THAT IT DOES WORK AND PURPORTED. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO WARN OTHERS AND FIX IT.

I'VE FELT DISCOMFORT EVEN ON MY DAILY WORK COMMUTE OF 15 MINUTES ONE WAY.  THE PAIN IS MORE SEVERE AFTER DRIVING FOR 40 MIN.  I SEE MY CHIROPRACTOR MORE OFTEN NOW.  I NOTICED THE HEADREST IS CURVED FORWARD AT AN EXTREME ANGLE, PUSHING MY HEAD FORWARD, PUTTING STRESS ON MY NECK.  MY UPPER BACK AND SHOULDERS FEELS STRAINED - REGARDLESS OF THE HEIGHT OF THE HEADREST.  THE HEADREST WAS THE CAUSE OF MY PAIN.  I AM 4'11 AND SIT UP STRAIGHT.  I'VE TRIED MULTIPLE SEAT ADJUSTMENT AND BOUGHT NECK SUPPORTS BUT NOTHING HAS HELPED.  I RESORTED TO PUTTING MY HEADREST BACKWARDS TO PROVIDE RELIEF.  I'VE MENTIONED THIS TO A SALESPERSON AND THE PARTS DEPT. AT THE DEALERSHIP.  BOTH OF THEM SAID HONDA DOES NOT HAVE ANY REPLACEMENT AND THE HEADREST WAS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS.  PRIOR TO THIS, I DROVE A 99 HONDA ACCORD EX AND THIS ISSUE NEVER OCCURRED.  I'VE TRIED PUTTING THE HEADREST FROM MY 99 ACCORD INTO THE 2014 BUT IT WON'T FIT DUE TO DIFFERENT CENTER-TO-CENTER POST MEASUREMENTS.  EVEN THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS FROM THE 2014 WILL NOT FIT IN THE DRIVER?S SEAT.  I HAD PICTURES TAKEN OF ME SITTING IN MY 99 ACCORD AND THE 2014 ACCORD.  IN THE ?99 ACCORD, MY NECK, UPPER BACK AND SHOULDER REST COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE SEAT AND HEADREST.  IN THE 2014, THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN MY NECK, UPPER BACK AND SHOULDER FROM THE SEAT WITH THE UPPER PORTION OF MY HEAD PUSHED FORWARD FROM THE HEADREST.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE SO HONDA CAN TAKE ACTION TO PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT OR MAKE IT A RECALL ISSUE.  THIS NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED FOR HEALTH, COMFORT AND SAFETY'S SAKE!  *TR",

I'VE TRIED MULTIPLE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING BUYING EXPENSIVE SEAT SUPPORTS BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP; THE SEAT JUST SEEMS TO BE POORLY DESIGNED.
