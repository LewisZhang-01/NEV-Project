IN THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER THE DOME LIGHTS NOR THE HEADLIGHTS SHINE.  WHEN THE IGNITION KEY IS ROTATED TO THE START POSITION, AS THE CLUTCH IS BEING DEPRESSED, SOMETIMES THE GAUGE LIGHTS APPEAR AND THEN QUICKLY FADE AND DISAPPEAR; THE CAR JUST DOESN'T CRANK.  A FAINT, DIMINISHING TELLTALE BUZZING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.    WHAT'S WORSE, THIS CAN HAPPEN SPONTANEOUSLY WHILE DRIVING, IN WHICH CASE THE CAR'S STEERING WHEEL LOCKS AND THE BRAKES BECOME INOPERABLE.  I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN ON THREE OCCASIONS, TWICE WHILE DRIVING IN A MALL PARKING LOT (FEBRUARY AND MARCH ''07) AND THE OTHER TIME (JUST LAST WEEK) WHILE TURNING INTO MY NEIGHBOR'S DRIVEWAY, TO TAKE OUT HER OAK TREE.    THE IGNITION CRANK SENSOR MUST SLIP INTO AN INOPERABLE MODE DURING DRIVING OR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO START THE CAR, OR THE ANTI-THEFT SWITCH SOMEHOW INTERFERES WITH STARTING, OPERATION OR DRIVING.  MAYBE THE MASTER IGNITION COIL IS FAILING (BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE HEADLIGHT AND DOME LIGHT PROBLEMS).  THE CLUTCH SWITCH MAY NOT ENGAGE WHEN ITS PEDAL IS BEING DEPRESSED.    SOMETIMES, I CAN RESTART THE CAR AFTER AN INCIDENT IN WHICH IT WAS PARKED FOR A WHILE.  MY BATTERY IS BRAND NEW, AND THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY SHORTS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.  BUT NOTHING ELECTRICALLY WORKS (NOT EVEN THE RADIO) WHEN I HAVE TO UNLOCK THE CAR MANUALLY.    I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING THE CAR BEYOND MY NEIGHBORHOOD.  I MIGHT HAVE TO BECOME A HERMIT, OR WORSE, A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.  ANY IDEAS?  THE CAR IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE OTHERWISE AND HAS ALL SERVICE RECORDS.",

THE DEFECTS REPORTED ARE THE SAME ON EACH INDIVIDUAL 99 MAXIMA LISTED.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IF SO MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS, WHY A RECALL IS NOT BEING DONE AT NISSAN'S EXPENSE.  I WISH I WOULD HAVE FOUND THIS WEBSITE BEFORE I PURCHASED MY MAXIMA.

THE PROBLEM THEN WENT AWAY.  ROOT CAUSE IS THE MANUFACTURER ORIGINALLY USED A TWO PIECE WIRE HARNESS THAT MAY (IN MY CASE DOES) BECOME DISCONNECTED WHEN THE SEAT IS MOVED THROUGHOUT ITS RANGE OF MOTION.  THE REPLACEMENT HARNESS IS LONGER AND HAS A DIRECT CONNECTION ACCORDING TO NISSAN.  I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS SAFETY ISSUE SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OEM NOT THE CONSUMER DUE TO THE FLAW IN DESIGN.

AFTER MY 60,000 MILE SERVICE AT THE DEALER (RTE. 22 NISSAN, HILLSIDE, NJ) IN DEC 2003, I NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE STUTTERED WHEN I PUT THE GEAR IN REVERSE. THE RPM METER OSCILLATED BETWEEN 0 AND 1000 CONTINUOUSLY BEFORE STABILIZING. I TOLD THE DEALER ABOUT THIS AND DURING MY REGULAR SERVICE, THE DEALER INSPECTED AND TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS AN IDLING PROBLEM AND THAT HE WOULD TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE CAR APPEARED TO BE FINE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT THEN STARTED STUTTERING AGAIN WHILE TAKING A REVERSE. THIS PROBLEM USED TO HAPPEN ONLY OCCASSIONALLY AND AND SO I COULD LIVE WITH IT. MEANWHILE I MOVED OVER TO CALIFORNIA, AND IT WAS ALSO TIME FOR MY NEXT SERVICE (66,000). I ASKED THE DEALER (MAGNUSSEN NISSAN, FREMONT, CA) TO HAVE DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM SINCE IT HAD STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND AFTER BEING $118 POORER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE WIRING HARNESS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $2,700 AND THAT ONE IN 50 NISSAN CARS HAD THIS PROBLEM. THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED IN A WORSE CONDITION THAN BEFORE. NOW THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ALWAYS LIT UP AND THE VEHICLE STARTED STOPPING WHENEVER THE CAR CAME TO A HALT (STOP SIGNS, TURNS AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS) AND ON SOME OCCASSIONS NARROWLY ESCAPING SOMEONE FROM REAR-ENDING MY CAR AT STOP SIGNS. MY CAR IS NOW IN A NON-DRIVABLE STATE FOR THE FEAR OF IT STALLING ANYTIME ON THE ROADS AND GETTING HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND FINALLY GOT TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE MY CAR WAS OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD (3 YRS/36,000), THEY COULD NOT ASSIST ME WITH FIXING THE CAR. THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PART THAT NISSAN HAS PROVIDED MY CAR WITH. THE WIRING HARNESS IS NOT A MOVING PART AND IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY HAS ACCESS TO AND ITS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A $2,800 SERVICE PENDING AFTER 5 YRS OF PURCHASE FOR A NON-MOVING PART.  *AK",
