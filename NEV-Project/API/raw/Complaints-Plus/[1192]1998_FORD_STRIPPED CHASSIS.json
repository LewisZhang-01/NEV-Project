        "summary": "OUR THOR MOTORHOME \"HURRICANE\" IS A 1998 ON WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE A 1999 CHASSIS.  WE BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW IN 1999 FROM SCOTT MOTOR HOMES, NJ. IT IS 30' WITH ONLY APPROXIMATELY 14,000 MILES ON IT.    IN AUGUST 2002, ON OUR WAY HOME FROM DISNEY WITH OUR TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, WE HEARD A NOISE WHENEVER I EXCELERATED.  WE WERE IN ROCKY MOUNT, NC AND IT WAS ABOUT 2:00 AM.  WE HAD JUST GASED UP AND THOUGHT WE'D BETTER STOP IN HE NEXT REST AREA ON I-95 TO CHECK TO SEE IF MAYBE WE HAD A FLAT TIRE.  NOTHING WAS NOTICABLY WRONG OUTSIDE THE MOTORHOME AND SO WE STARTED TO LEAVE THE REST AREA, HOWEVER BEFORE WE EVEN LEFT WE NOTICED THE NOISE GETTING LOUDER.  IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT, I CALLED OUR CAMPER WORLD ROAD SERVICE AND THEY SAID WE SHOULD STAY IN THE REST AREA FOR THE NIGHT AND CALL FIRST THING SUNDAY MORNING FOR HELP.  WE NEEDED TO BE TOWED TO A TRUCK REPAIR SHOP.  TAKE CLOTHES FOR THE NIGHT, GET A RIDE TO A HOTEL AND RENT A CAR THE NEXT DAY AND WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.  THE ENTIRE REAR END HAD TO BE REPLACED.  REPAIRS COSTS APPROXIMATELY $5,500 AND THE PARTS HAD TO BE ORDERED FROM TWO DIFFERENT STATES.    WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE HOME IN THE RENTED CAR TO BRING OUR 6 AND 8 YRS. OLD GRANDCHILDREN HOME.  RETURN THE RENTED CAR TO NC ON THE NEXT WEEKEND.  I DROVE THE RENTAL CAR AND MY WIFE FOLLOWED ME WITH OUR CAR SINCE THE PARTS WERE STILL NOT IN.      ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER, I TOOK A TRAIN TO ROCKY MOUNT, NC AND A TAXI CAB TO THE DEALER TO PICK UP THE MOTORHOME.   THIS TRANSMISSION NEVER SHOULD HAVE BROKEN!    WE ARE NOW IN DEBT ON OUR CREDIT CARD FOR CLOSE TO $7,000 FOR THIS WHOLE BREAKDOWN.  MOTEL,FOOD,TOLLS,GAS,RENTAL CAR (TWICE FROM NC TO NJ THEN NJ TO NC) AND NJ VIA AMTRAK TO GET BACK TO NC TO PICK UP THE MOTORHOME.  WE FEEL WE SHOULD BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION FOR HELP.  IT WAS A FORD ENGINE.",
