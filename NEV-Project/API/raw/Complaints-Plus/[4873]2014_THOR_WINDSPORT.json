I HAVE TO STOP AND GET OUT AND PHYSICALLY PULL THE WIPER BLADE UP WHILE THEY ARE RUNNING TO GET IT GOING AGAIN.    THIS FIRST HAPPENED THE DAY I BROUGHT IT HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP. IT WAS RAINING VERY HARD WITH HEAVY GUSTS OF WIND, AND I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE WITH THE WIPERS ON AND IT SEEMS LIKE A GUST OF WIND CAUGHT THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER AND PEGGED IT AGAINST THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER, CAUSING BOTH TO GET STUCK. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT FREE, BUT WITH THE WIND THAT HIGH IT KEPT DOING IT.    WHEN I GOT HOME AND TURNED THE WIPERS ON TO INVESTIGATE, THEY WORKED FINE, SO I JUST ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE GUSTY CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, IT HAPPENED A FEW OTHER TIMES SINCE THEN WHILE DRIVING.     THE LAST TIME I TRIED TO USE THE WIPERS WHILE SITTING STILL AND IT DID IT IMMEDIATELY. SO AT THIS POINT THE WIPERS ARE COMPLETELY USELESS.",
