        "summary": "I left my home with my daughter in the afternoon to go to the bank and hardware store. I drove to the bank to make a deposit.  We had to wait for quite awhile in the drive-through line at the bank, so I turned off my engine a couple of times rather than having the car idle. After making the deposit at the bank, I pulled out of the bank lot and began driving to the hardware store. I had driven for about two minutes and was driving along at approximately 25-30 miles an hour, and suddenly there was a terrible explosion at my left ear and massive pain in my left arm. I thought the car had been shot at and my arm hit. I was terrified we were still being shot at and looked at my daughter whose hands were over her ears. I could tell by that time that I was not bleeding and so was worried that the bullet had hit her. I could hear only faintly out of my left ear.  There was smoke and the smell of an explosion.  I could see by this time that an airbag had come out of my driver's seat and thought that it had been hit too. My daughter told me she was o.k. and to pull the car over so that we could see what had happened. I was shaking with fear and pain in my arm but finally calmed down enough to park the car and get out to see what had happened. It became clear that the car had not been shot at and that the driver's side seat airbag had simply spontaneously exploded without any warning whatsoever. The driver's seat side seam was completely ripped, multiple pieces of seat foam were lying about, and the air bag in the seat was out and ripped. The seat was still smoking. Luckily I had had my window completely down, or the explosion would have been louder in the car, and my arm and left side could have been more badly injured. I called my longtime Saab repairman who told me that what happened to me was extremely rare. He said I would need a new seat and that the computer system would need to be reset for the airbag system to work again. Insurance will examine soon. I may try GM too.",

THE 2001 SAAB 9-3, WHICH I OWN, WAS FIRST REPAIRED BECAUSE THE FUEL LINES WERE CORRUPTED AND CAUSED FUEL TO PUMP OUT INTO THE OPEN ON TOP OF THE GAS TANK.  THIS WAS REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY AND WAS NOT UNDER RECALL AT THAT TIME.  MUCH LATER, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR AN INSPECTION OF THE FUEL PUMP BRACKET TO MAKE SURE THE A \"NEW\" BRACKET HAD BEEN INSTALLED.  THESE TWO INSPECTIONS REQUIRED THE LOWERING OF THE FUEL TANK.   I RECEIVED A CODE 0442 A FEW MONTHS LATER AND HAD THE SAAB DEALER INSPECT POSSIBLE CAUSE.  IT  WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VENT HOSE FILLER PIPE HAS A LEAK AS DETERMINED BY A \"SMOKE\" CHECK.  LATER, AT A DIFFERENT SHOP, WHILE HAVING A TIRE ROTATION, THE TECHNICIAN HAD ME COME OUT AND CHECK THE RIGHT WHEEL AREA WITH THE WHEEL ASSEMBLY REMOVED.  WHAT WAS REVEALED WAS A \"RUB\" HOLE IN THE VENT HOSE CAUSED BY CONTACT WITH THE SHOCK ABSORBER.  I HAVE DIGITAL PHOTOS OF THE DAMAGE.      THE DAMAGED VENT LINE IS EITHER 1) POOR ENGINEERING OF THE VENT LINE IN RELATION TO THE SHOCK ABSORBER, OR 2) THE DAMAGE WAS THE ACT OF POOR RE-INSTALLMENT OF THE FUEL TANK EITHER ON THE REPAIR OR LATER INSPECTION.  MY QUESTION IS THIS, \" HAS THERE BEEN ANY REPORTS OF SHOCK ABSORBERS, OR OTHER PARTS, CAUSING HOLES IN THE VENT LINES WHICH PASS NEAR THE RIGHT WHEEL ASSEMBLY?\"     SAAB HAS NOT BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. *TR",
