THIS ALL HAPPENS WHENEVER IT WANTS. I SHUT OFF THE CAR AND RESTART AND THE PROBLEM WILL STAY GONE AND DRIVE NORMAL UNTIL IT COOLS AGAIN AND THEN RESTART THE VEHICLE. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN TESTED AT 3 SHOPS AND TURNED AWAY BY ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START AS THEY ARE SCANNING THE VEHICLE AND 17 CODES CAME UP. THEY STARTED TESTING EACH ITEM WITH A CODE AND ALL CAME BACK AS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. SO I BELIEVE IT'S EITHER ELECTRICAL OR ONE OF THE BRAINS/COMPUTERS OF THE VEHICLE?. IT IS BECOMING A SAFETY CONCERN AND I NEED HELP.",

THE WORST PART IS WHEN I TRIED TO GET A NEW FUEL PUMP  FOR THIS I WAS TOLD THEY WERE ON BACK ORDER AND WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AUG 5 2013.  SO THAT IS 2 MONTHS WITHOUT A SECOND CAR, AND MAKES IT VERY HARD TO MAKE IT TO WORK ONTIME.  FORD THEN STATED THAT I DOSE NOT SHOW THAT I ORDERED A PART AND THEY COULD NOT HELP UNLESS I ORDERED THE PART AND THEN THEY WOULD SEE ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  NOW A RECALL SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO FOR THIS AS MELTED WIRES IN A SECURED GASOLINE TANK.  THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE AND IED WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING INTO THIS.

AFTER 2HRS HE CAME AND SAID THAT IT INDICATED IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP, BUT THAT IT SHOWED IT FIXED ITSELF SO HE WANTED TO TEST DRIVE IT BEFORE I WOULD GO HOME......WELL NOT EVEN TWO MINUTES AFTER HE LEFT HIS COWORKER CAME IN AND SAID THAT HE JUST BROKE DOWN IN MY VEHICLE. SO HE BUMPED UNDER THE TANK AND IT STARTED BACK UP. SO THIS TO HIM INDICATED THAT IT WAS FOR SURE THE FUEL PUMP.

WHILE ON A DAY TRIP IN MARCH MY AVERAGE SIZED BROTHER SAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE MIDDLE ROW SEATS. THROUGHOUT OUR TRIP THE SEAT BACK WOULD NOT HOLD TO SUPPORT HIM AND WAS REPEATEDLY FLYING BACKWARD.  THIS IS HOW WE DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM.

THIS VEHICLE IS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN USED WITH NORMAL FAMILY WEAR AND TEAR.  IT HAS NOT BEEN ABUSED IN ANY WAY.   WE DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS A FAILED/DEFECTIVE PART AFFECTING THIS ONE SEAT IN OUR VEHICLE OR IF THERE IS SOMETHING STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND IN THE SEAT DESIGN OF THE EXPEDITION.  WE HAVE CONTACTED FORD REGARDING THE ISSUE AND THEY TELL US THEY ARE COMMITTED TO SAFETY AND SHARE OUR CONCERN YET WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE NEW VEHICLE WARRANTY IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT. THIS ANSWER IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THEY ARE USING EMPTY WORDS.  MY FATHER WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND I HAVE 5 CHILDREN THAT I DRIVE AROUND DAILY.  SAFETY IS MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN A VEHICLE.  I AM CONCERNED PRIMARILY FOR THE SAFETY OF MY OWN FAMILY BUT ALSO ALL THOSE ON THE ROAD.  PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH FORD.

UNDER FURTHER INVESTIGATION I FIND THAT THE TIRE DOES NOT HAVE ANY PUNCTURE AND IT IS A CRACKED VALVE STEM THAT IS CAUSING THE LEAK.

I CHECKED ALL TIRES AND DID NOT SEE AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF TIRE PRESSURE AND SINCE I WAS IN A RURAL AREA AT THE TIME I FELT THAT IT WAS IN MY BEST INTEREST TO GET TO A MORE POPULATED AREA WHERE I COULD HAVE THE TIRES CHECKED.  THE TIRE QUICKLY LOST ALL AIR PRESSURE AND WENT FLAT CAUSING ME TO TAKE AN EVASIVE MOVE TO GET OFF THE ROAD.  THE TIRE WAS CHANGED AND I TOOK THE FAILED TIRE INTO FUTURE FORD OF ROSEVILLE WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE.  THE TIRE HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A PUNCTURE OR REASON FOR THE TIRE TO FAIL.  NO COMPENSATION FROM THE DEALER WAS OFFERED.  ON OCTOBER 16, 2008, THE LOW TIRE SENSOR LIGHT AGAIN ACTIVATED.  AFTER CHECKING ALL TIRES I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE TIRE VALUES WAS SPLIT AND LEAKING (HISSING).  I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL TIRE COMPANY TO HAVE IT REPAIRED.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE OTHER TIRE VALUES WE FOUND THAT ALL THE VALUES (EXCEPT FOR THE NEW TIRE THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED) WERE ALL SPLIT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY START TO LEAK.  I HAD ALL THE VALUES REPLACED ON ALL THE TIRES.  AT THE TIME THE TIRE COMPANY, LES SCHWAB, INFORMED ME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTED ISSUES WITH LEAKING TIRE VALVES ON SOME FORD VEHICLES.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT CONSUMER REPORTS IS RECOMMENDING THAT ALL 2007 FORD VEHICLE TIRE VALVES BE INSPECTED AND REPLACED IF FOUND TO BE CRACKED. ON 10/17/08, I REPORTED THIS TO FUTURE FORD OF ROSEVILLE AND THEY WERE UNAWARE OF ANY TYPE OF TIRE VALVE FAILURES.  SEEMS THAT CAR DEALERS SHOULD BE CHECKING FOR THIS PROBLEM ON DILL VALVES.  LES SCHWAB WAS ABLE TO RECOVER 2 OF THE CRACKED VALVES FROM MY EXPEDITION. ALL ARE TR414 VALVES WHICH APPEAR TO BE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR FAILURE AND POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUES.  MY COST FOR THIS PROBLEM IS NOW $250.00. *TR",

THIS HAS BEEN WITNESSED BY THE FORD DEALER WHO WAS SHOCKED, BUT HAS TOLD ME ITS WORKING THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED...........

WE HAD THIS SUV FOR LESS THAN 2 WEEKS WHEN THE POWER STEERING AND THE RACK AND PINION FAILED. I WAS BACKING OUT OF A TIGHT PARKING SPACE WHEN I FELT THE SUV SORT OF THUMP. WITHIN 500 FEET, AS I WAS LEAVING THE PARKING LOT, THE POWER STEERING WAS COMPLETELY GONE. AFTER TAKING IT TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE RACK AND PINION WAS BLOWN. THIS IS OUR 2ND EXPEDITION (WE OWNED A 2001 EDDIE BAUER). I CONVINCED MY HUSBAND TO TRADE IN OUR 2007 TAHOE LTZ FOR THE EXPEDITION LIMITED BECAUSE I MISSED MANY OF THE BASIC FEATURES SUCH AS THE SEATS FOLDING FLAT, THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL, HANDLE ON DRIVERS SIDE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW A BRAND NEW EXPEDITION CAN HAVE THE POWER STEERING AND RACK AND PINION FAIL WITH LESS THAN 500 MILES AND FROM JUST SIMPLY BACKING OUT OF A TIGHT PARKING SPACE. I THOUGHT THAT THE 20\" TIRES HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. SOME OF OUR FRIENDS WHO ARE \"CAR PEOPLE\" SAID THAT THE HOSE TO SUPPORT THE POWER STEERING WAS PROBABLY NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY AND WHEN I MADE THE TIGHT TURN, IT SNAPPED IT OUT OF THE SOCKET. THE SERVICE REP SAID THAT THEY PROBABLY MADE SOME MISTAKES DURING MANUFACTURING THAT CAUSED THE ENTIRE RACK AND PINION TO BE DEFECTIVE.  THE FAILURES OCCURRED ON AUGUST 3, 2007, AND THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE DON CHALMERS FORD DEALERSHIP LOCATED IN RIO RANCHO, NEW MEXICO.   WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A LOANER VEHICLE.  WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONTACTED TO INFORM US OF WHAT THE EXACT PROBLEM IS, OR THE CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED.  WE BELIEVE THESE ISSUES ARE UNACCEPTABLE ON A $45K AUTOMOBILE.
