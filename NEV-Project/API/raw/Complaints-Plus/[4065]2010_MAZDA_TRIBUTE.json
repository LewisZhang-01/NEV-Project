WE HAD THE VEHICLE AT A MAZDA DEALERSHIP THE FRIDAY & SATURDAY BEFORE.  THEY APPARENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE AND ALL THEY DID WAS CLEAN OUT THE THROTTLE BODY, AND SAID THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. WHY DID MAZDA NOT HAVE TO DO THE SAME AS FORD?  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE DIES.  IT IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES! CONSUMERS WITH THESE AUTOS NEED TO BE NOTIFIED!!!
