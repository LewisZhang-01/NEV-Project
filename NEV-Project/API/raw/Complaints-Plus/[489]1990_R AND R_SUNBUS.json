        "summary": "I HAVE HAD 2 FAILURES OF MY GOODYEAR WRANGLER LT TIRES AT FREEWAY SPEEDS (APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH). ONE OCCURED ON APPROXIMATELY 12/27/98 AND ANOTHER ON 5/28/99. IN BOTH CASES THE TIRE TREAD DELAMINATED RAPIDLY EXPOSING THE STEEL BELTS. THE FIRST INCIDENT HAD THE STEEL BELTS COME APART AS WELL, AND THE BROKEN STEEL WIRES TORE APART MY WHEEL WELL LEAVING A 2' DIA HOLE INTO THE CABIN. THE SPINNING WIRES STARTED TO HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE SOFA THAT MY SON WAS SLEEPING ON. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO STOP BEFORE MY SON WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT THE TIRES PROPERLY INFLATED TO 58 PSI +/- 2 PSI PER THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEALER I PURCHASED THEM FROM. I WOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS INCIDENT EARLIER, BUT THOUGHT IT WAS PERHAPS A ISOLATED RANDOM EVENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, I HAVE HEARD THAT THE NHTSA IS INVESTIGATING GOODYEAR AS WELL AS FIRESTONE FOR TIRE FAILURES OF THIS KIND. I THOUGHT YOU FOLKS MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW OF MY EXPERIENCE. I STILL HAVE 3 OF THE ORIGINAL 6 GOODYEARS ON MY MOTORHOME. PERHAPS I SHOULD REPLACE THEM? I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION.    SINCERELY,  JERRY R. FREY. *AK (DOT NUMBER: N/A  TIRESIZE: 8.75R16.5)",
