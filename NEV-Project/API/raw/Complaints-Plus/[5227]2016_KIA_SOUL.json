No modifications have been made to this system to my knowledge, and no fuses were burned out prior to the dial failing, due to the melting plastic creating an air gap between the contactor terminals.  Half of the plastic on the housing appears to be a heat resistant glass reinforced polyamide, and the (melted) half appears to be made of standard ABS plastic.  This implies engineering expected this component to get hot, but still cut costs irresponsibly by using cheaper ABS in hope that the other half of this component would not get hot enough to melt (or potentially catch fire, had the plastic not melted away in a fashion that simply disconnected the contactors).  I believe this case is not unique, as failures of this component appear common online.  However I believe the true cause of failure (and potential risk of fire from the heat) has not yet been identified due to this contactor being located within a sealed control board assembly.",

KIA has a recall on the same model with the 1.6L engine, but there have been many instances of the 2.0L experiencing the same failure, but not being recalled. My vehicle has been well maintained, regularly serviced and not abused. My mechanic has had two other customers in less than a year experiencing this failure in the same engine.  Vehicle has had loss of power along with oil pressure indicator light flashing. Car only remotely operates normal with in ECO mode.   My local KIA dealership has not wanted to be helpful in any of these three cases. For the 1.6L that is recalled, owners who have this type of failure have had new engines installed. KIA America and my local dealership have not wanted to address this option.   Said vehicle has sale value of $5,000 while this sort of repair would cost upwards of $9,000 if handled privately. As it stands, my repair bill is over $600 without actually fixing the problem that mechanic says will lead to complete engine failure.   It would benefit myself and the other owners of Kia Soul+ 2.0L if the automaker would include these engines in the same recall as the KIA Soul+ 1.6L.   As it stands, my vehicle cannot be sold in current condition and cannot be repaired due to very high cost. Any help from a government agency in encouraging KIA to include these KIA Soul+ 2.0L automobiles would be a great help to an untold number of US consumers experiencing this issue. It is simply too costly to repair on our own.",

I would like to reiterate we were on the Interstate at posted speed of 70 mph, when I was forced to maneuver through a number of Semi-Trucks while our speed was rapidly declining.  Once towed to the dealership I was informed of a hole in the engine block and there is a \"Product Improvement\" PI20023 regarding the knock sensor.

I felt burning on my hand and pain and yanked my hand away immediately, pulled over, and looked behind me at the seat, in time to see a curl of smoke coming out of a small hole on the back of the seat. I also found that the palm of my hand had a small mark beneath the base of my thumb where I had felt the burning pain. It took at least half an hour for the burning sensation to fade. I also detected an odor of smoke for a bit afterward.  I had no warning that this was going to happen other than the burning feeling the heated seat had started to generate upon my back- no warning lights or such. I have not had any service done on the problem yet though I intend to contact Kia soon; so the car is currently in the same state although obviously I don't turn the heated seat on anymore since I don't want things in my car to be on fire.",

As of this writing, the vehicle was taken into Car town Kia ( Oct. 6, 2021) for inspection and computer upgrade but vehicle was not fixed to solve the problem. There was a recall for this particular item but the vehicle still was not fixed. High exhaust gas temperatures may damage the catalytic converter, possibly resulting in abnormal engine combustion, damage to the engine's pistons, and possible piston connecting rod failure but yet, the vehicle has not been fixed.  I am afraid that this vehicle will probably catch fire while I am driving it while family members are in the vehicle. I believe my safety as well as the general public can/could be jeopardized if the vehicle were to catch fire. I have no actual confirmation that the vehicle was actually inspected. Kia service managers take no responsibility for the matter and I have been told to resolve the complaint with KIA general management. This issue is a safety hazard and there have been many instances of these vehicles electrical/engine components catching fire while someone is driving.",

I had my partner and our dogs in the car with us and had to walk down the highway to the gas station to call somebody since we didn't have service. It was also 110 degrees outside, so the car failing put us in a pretty dangerous situation.    We had JUST gotten the recall notice for the vehicle's engine a week before (it looked like it had gotten lost in the mail) and had called around to the Kia Dealerships in the area and none could see us for over a month, which was a problem because we were going to be moving back to the PNW from Death Valley (we had to relocate because I was laid off due to COVID) in less than a month. The closest dealerships were also 100+ miles away.   We towed the car with us to WA and got it into a dealership ASAP and they confirmed that the engine had a knock, but Kia refused to fix the issue, stating that because the Knock Sensor Detection Software hadn't been installed, it was not under warranty.

It was performed in the AM drove it pretty much all day. the next morning 8.14.21 in the AM drove it for roughly 1hr parked then decided to move the car out of the sun the car would not start. I could put it in the ACC and ON positions to work the radio and windows etc. but it would not start. I was there for 1.5 hrs. then I tried the car again and it started as if nothing was wrong. I drove it for 1 week no issues, then on 08.21.21 I was waiting at a red light when the light turned green I could not move as the car shut down with no warning or warning lights. I put the car in park and then tried turning on the vehicle again it started no issues, I was nervous and scared because we, my daughter and I, were at a very busy intersection not knowing if the car was going to start again. On 08.22.21 I tried starting the car and it took a while for it start as well but started. On 08.23.21 I called the KIA dealer and let them know what happened and took it to them on 8.24.21 in the AM. They were not able to replicate the problem but adjusted the values and said that there were no shut off codes indicated and that was a good sign. I was able to drive it all morning then at 3:15pm it would not start then at around 4:45pm I tried it again and the car started. When it started the stability control light was on and pressing the button to turn it off would not turn it off. I drove it about 5 minutes parked it turned the car off, when I started the car again the stability control light did not come on. I drove it around for a little then called a different KIA dealer and explained the situation so I dropped the vehicle off to the dealer on 8.24.21 in the overnight drop where it currently is where they are charging 139 dollars to diagnose the problem the car has approx 162329 miles",

I never knew that there was a severe issue with my car, my check engine lights never came on. I took my car in to Car Pros Kia in Huntington Beach a couple months ago for a transmission fluid change and they never told me anything was wrong or that this Product Improvement Campaign was available. On 6/1/2021 my car died out of nowhere. I took the car to KIA where they filed a claim for a new engine per the product improvement campaign but it was denied. Dan Boyer, supervisor from Kia Motors America Claims Department told me the deadline was 4/16/21. This date isn't on any letter they sent. After searching, I realized that these letters are available for the public to view. I realized that one letter from 3/21/2020 states in bold underlined format \"We would, however, like to assure you that there is no immediate need to have this software update performed\". Clearly this is incorrect information, getting this software update is CRUCIAL-your engine WILL be damaged if the rod bearings are damaged as mine was. Kia Motors expected me to bring my car, despite I never received a letter, I had no idea there was product improvement campaign surrounding this issue, and expected people to bring their car in for it in the middle of a pandemic. Now I can't go to work, my livelihood is at stake, and they want me to pay $6,000 out of pocket + any other fee associated without taking any responsibility on the matter.

I DID NOT HEAR BACK ABOUT MY CAR UNTIL I REACHED OUT FOR THE 3RD TIME FRIDAY 5/14/21, WHERE THE TECH TOLD ME I NEEDED A REPLACEMENT ENGINE AND KIA MOTORS WILL NOT COVER IT, STATING IT WAS BECAUSE \"THERE IS AN OPEN RECALL FOR MY ENGINE AND I HAD NOT HAD THE RECALL COMPLETED\" I HAVE OPENED A CASE WITH KIA CUSTOMER AFFAIRS. KIA SERVICE CENTER WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ME THE DATE THAT THE RECALL STARTED.I DO KNOW THAT MY CAR WAS SERVICED FOR A RECALL PRIOR TO THIS, 3/31/2020, IN WHICH THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, IT NEEDED REPLACED. THAT WAS COVERED UNDER THE RECALL APPARENTLY, BUT FOR SOME REASON THIS MOST RECENT RECALL IS NOW SHOWING THAT IT IS NO LONGER OPEN ACCORDING TO MY VIN ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE. SO THE DEALERSHIP MUST HAVE CLEARED IT, BUT STILL CLAIMS IT WAS NOT COMPLETED SO THAT THEY ARE REFUSING TO REPLACE MY ENGINE, QUOTING ME $6.3K SHOULD BE COVERED 100%",

IT WAS TOWED TO DUTCH MILLER KIA OF CHARLOTTE.  THE CAR HAD 51,188 MILES.     AFTER A WEEK THE DEALER TOLD US THE CAR WASN'T GOING TO BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  I THEN FILED A COMPLAINT WITH KIA CUSTOMER RELATIONS WHO REVIEWED THE CASE AND DID NOTHING TO HELP.  I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, BRANT BLACKWELDER WHO AGREED TO SPEAK WITH THE DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE.  ON 26 JUNE, THEY STATED THEY WOULD EXTEND A \"GOOD FAITH\" OFFER OF REPLACING THE ENGINE, BUT I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LABOR ($1,700 ESTIMATED).  DURING THE 3 MONTHS IT TOOK TO REBUILD THE ENGINE, I WAS FORCED TO PAY FOR ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION AND PAID $1,517.47 IN RENTAL CAR AND LYFT FEES.    THE CAR HAS HAD REGULAR OIL CHANGES AS DIRECTED BY THE MAINTENANCE MINDER.  THE LAST OIL CHANGE WAS IN JANUARY WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD 44,586 MILES (6,6602 MILES AGO).  THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS THE ENGINE WAS LOW ON OIL: THE MAINTENANCE MINDER, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, NOR THE LOW OIL LIGHT EVER CAME ON.  DURING MY CONVERSATION WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER ON 25 JUNE, HE ADMITTED THAT KIA ENGINES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BURNING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF OIL EVEN AFTER AS LITTLE AS 2,000 MILES FROM AN OIL CHANGE.  AT NO TIME DID KIA DISCLOSE THIS ISSUE OF ENGINES BURNING OIL TO ME OR OTHER OWNERS.  WHILE THIS CAR HAS THE 2.0-LITER ENGINE THAT ISN'T CURRENTLY UNDER RECALL, I BELIEVE THIS IS A SIMILAR CASE TO THE 379,000 KIA 1.6-LITER ENGINES THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECALLED.  KIA IS SIMPLY PASSING THE BLAME ON TO CUSTOMERS FOR A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THEIR FAULTY ENGINES.     THIS ISSUE IS SIMILAR TO THE 1.6L ENGINES NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.",

IT SLOWED DOWN TO 40MPH WITHIN SECONDS AND IT IS ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD THAT I WAS ABLE TO PULL THE CAR OVER AND TURN ONTO A COUNTRY BACKROAD BEFORE IT JUST SHUT OFF COMPLETELY. WE IMMEDIATELY HAD IT TOWED TO A BODYSHOP OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WAS JUST A MINOR ISSUE. TURNS OUT WE COULDNT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. LOW AND BEHOLD THE ENGINE HAD A PISTON ROD THAT FELL OUT OF PLACE CAUSING THE KNOCKING AND THE ENGINE TO START LEAKING OIL AT AN ACCELERATED RATED THROUGH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THE BODYSHOP WAS NICE ENOUGH TO CHECK FOR RECALLS FOR US AND FOUND ONE THAT FITS OUR ISSUES EXACTLY. BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ITS ONLY FOR THE 1.6 LITER ENGINE AND OURS WONT BE COVERED BECAUSE ITS A 2.0...EVEN THOUGH ITS THE SAME PROBLEM. SO WE THEN GO ON TO FILING A CLAIM WITH KIA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PAID TO HAVE TO CAR TOWED TO A KIA DEALERSHIP SO THEY COULD DIAGNOSE WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW. AGAIN HOPEFUL THAT THEY WOULD SEE THE ISSUE AND OFFER TO PAY FOR IT UNDER GOODWILL SINCE IT IS SO COMMON A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT MOST ALL OF THEIR CARS. I WAS BESIDE MYSELF WHEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WASNT THE SAME PROBLEM AT ALL, EVEN THOUGH THIS MIRRORS THE RECALL ISSUES TO A T. WELL WE ESCALATED THE CLAIM THROUGH CONSUMER AFFAIRS THEY CAME BACK AND STILL DENIED THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH THEIR CAR. WE ARE NOW HAVING TO LOOK AT TAKING LEGAL ACTIONS TO GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE US BEING A YOUNG COUPLE WITH CHILDREN WE DO NOT HAVE THE $8,000-$12,000 IT WILL TAKE TO REPLACE AN ENGINE THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BLOWN.

AFTER LETTING IT SIT THAT AFTERNOON HAD TO DRIVE IT HOME A SHORT DISTANCE BUT DID SO VERY CAREFULLY TRYING NOT TO STRAIN THE ENGINE. THEN HAD IT TOWED THE NEXT DAY TO LOCAL DEALERSHIP. ENGINE ISSUE, BROKEN CONNECTING ROD CLANKING AROUND IN ENGINE DAMAGED THE ENGINE BLOCK. AFTER RESEARCHING I FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE BUT THAT MY KIA SOUL PLUS WITH THE 2.0L ENGINE WAS NOT INCLUDED. I SCOURED THE WEB LOOKING FOR OTHER PLUS OR EXCLAIM SOUL OWNERS WITH SIMILAR ISSUES AND THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE. I THINK THE 2.0 L ENGINE NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED WITH THIS RECALL ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",

I WAS QUOTED $4,000 TO $6,000 FOR A USED ONE AND FOR A NEW ONE IT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. I'VE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF THIS VEHICLE AND HAVE MAINTAINED AND REGULAR OIL CHANGES. SEVERAL OF THE OIL CHANGES WERE PERFORMED AT AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP THAT WENT BANKRUPT. I HAVE NO WAY TO OBTAIN COPIES OF THOSE RECEIPTS.
