FORTUNATELY, THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE CAR TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE WITHOUT HITTING ANYTHING OR ANYONE OR EVEN ROLLING THE VEHICLE.

WE THEN SURMISED THAT WE HAD POSSIBLY HIT SOMETHING ON THE ROAD (LIKE A BLOWN TIRE REMNANT), BUT ALSO FOUND NOTHING. THE DRIVER AND BOTH PASSENGERS GOT BACK IN THE CAR TO SEE IF WE COULD PROCEED SLOWLY/SAFELY DOWN THE INTERSTATE TO THE NEXT EXIT IN ORDER TO CALL FOR SERVICE BUT THE CAR IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO FISHTAIL AGAIN, SO WE CALLED FOR A AAA TOW FROM THE INTERSTATE. WHILE WAITING FOR THE TOW TO ARRIVE, WE REINSPECTED THE TIRES AND FOUND THE RIGHT REAR TIRE TO BE TURNED OUT SLIGHTLY. THE CAR WAS TOWED VIA FLAT BED  124 MILES TO A FORD DEALER IN BAKERSFIELD WHERE IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED TO BE A FAILED TOE LINK SUSPENSION ASSOCIATED WITH FORD RECALL 20S04.
