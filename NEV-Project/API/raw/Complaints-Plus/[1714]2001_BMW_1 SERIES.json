        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING VERY SLOWLY DOWN MY BLOCK (2001 BMW X5)  AND I WAS MAKING A RIGHT TURN INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND I WAS INTENDING TO MAKE A 90 DEGREE TURN IN THE DIRECTION OF MY GARAGE. AS I WAS JUST INTO THE TURN THE CAR ACCELERATED FROM 1MPH TO ABOUT 30 MPH OR EVEN FASTER IN LESS THAN A SECOND- IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL. I WAS IN SHOCK NOT EXPECTING THIS SCENARIO-  I TRULY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE OR CRASH. I WAS BRAKING ENTIRE TIME AND NO STOPPING WAS HAPPENING.  I WAS HEADED FOR MY LIVING ROOM WINDOW.  TRIED TO STEER IT AWAY AND ONCE I HIT THE LAWN MY STEERING ABILITY WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.  WAS TRYING TO FIGURE IF I SHOULD HIT THE TREE BECAUSE MY CAR WAS HEADING FOR MY NEIGHBOR'S FRONT WINDOW. TIRE TRACKS AND SKID MARKS ALL OVER MY FRONT LAWN AND DRIVEWAY.   AT THAT POINT I TURNED KEY OFF. CAR STOPPED. HAD ABOUT 2 OR 3 SECONDS TO REACT .  IT HAPPENED SO FAST AND OUT OF NOWHERE.    BY THE WAY AS I WAS TRAVELING DOWN MY STREET, I HAPPENED TO COMPLETELY STOP ABOUT 100 FEET FROM MY INTENDED RIGHT TURN.  A NEIGHBOR WAS PULLING OUT OF THEIR DRIVEWAY AND I WAS GOING TO LET THAT PERSON HAVE THE RIGHT AWAY.  THE CAR WAS AT A DEAD STOP 100 FT. FROM MY DRIVEWAY ENTRANCE.  WAS TRAVELING AT A VERY SLOW SPEED AS I APPROACHED MY DRIVEWAY.  HAD NO VELOCITY AT THAT POINT-  VERY SLOW ENTRANCE INTO DRIVEWAY.  *TR",
