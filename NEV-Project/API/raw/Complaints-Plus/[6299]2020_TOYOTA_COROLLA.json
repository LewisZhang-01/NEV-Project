THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT SINCE DURING THE 46 YEARS I LIVED IN THE SAME HOME AND OWNED MANY CARS INCLUDING 2 TOYOTA CAMRY, VW RABBIT, MUSTANG, PORSCHE, MERCURY SABLE , 2 CADILLACS,  3 BUICKS AND I HAD NO PROBLEM OF ANY OF THESE CARS SCOPING GROUND AND LOOSING A FENDER.  I RETURNED CAR TO THE DEALER, DAYTON TOYOTA ON 6/28/19 WITH A FINANCIAL LOSS OF $2772.84.  BANNING OF THIS COROLLA FROM THE ROADS WILL SAVE NUMEROUS LIVES. PLEASE ACT PROMPTLY.
