A SCARY SITUATION BECAUSE SHE WAS MEETING TRAFFIC AND BEHIND HER WAS AN 18 WHEELER BIG TRUCK AND OTHER VARIOUS VEHICLES.

POOR DESIGN SHOULD BE NOTED IN THAT THIS ATTACHMENT IS UPSIDE DOWN.

WHILE THE REPAIR COST ME $372, MY BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT THIS INCIDENT EASILY FALLS WITHIN THE TOP 3 MOST HORRIFYING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE....DRIVING ALONE, AT NIGHT, IN THE RAIN, AND SUDDENLY A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF BOTH WIPERS, LEAVING ME UNABLE TO SEE OUT MY FRONT WINDSHIELD, WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND NOWHERE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD.  *TR",

THE SERVICE STABILITRAK WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AT VARIOUS TIMES, COUPLED WITH REALLY ROUGH IDLE.  I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT AS IT WAS SO RANDOM I NEVER THOUGHT I HAD A SERIOUS ENGINE DEFECT.  IN JULY OF 2014 I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 60 MILES TO WORK ONE WAY, AND THAT IS WHEN THE REAL TROUBLE BEGAN.  THE SERVICE STABILITRAK ERROR MESSAGE WOULD COME ON SEVERAL TIMES DURING THOSE CAR TRIPS REDUCING POWER.  I WOULD PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF, TURN IT BACK ON, AND MOST TIMES THE CAR RESUMED NORMAL DRIVING CONDITION.  ONE DAY IN JULY 2014 THE CAR JUST DIED, IT WOULDN'T RUN.  I HAD IT TOWED TO A GMC DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY AS I HAD UNDER 36,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  THEY REPLACED TRANSMISSION, TRANSAXLE, TENSIONER, CHAIN, CHAIN PACKAGE, GASKET, WATER PUMP, AND BALANCE SHAFT REPLACEMENT. THEY ALSO REPROGRAMMED ECM AND PERFORMED MORE DIAGNOSTICS ON SERVICE ENGINE SOON WARNING LIGHT.  FROM JANUARY 2015 THRU JULY 2015 I'VE HAD HORRIBLE ISSUES WITH SERVICE STABILITRAK ERRORS AND THE ENGINE GOING INTO LOW POWER MODE.  IT WOULD GO AWAY LONG ENOUGH PERIODS THAT I JUST DIDN'T GET IT LOOKED AT BUT NOW IT COMES ON REDUCING POWER EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR.  I REALLY HOPE THIS IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SOMEHOW OR ABLE TO BE FIXED THROUGH RECALL.  I FEEL LIKE I GOT A LEMON FROM THE BEGINNING BUT DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL MUCH LATER.  I'M HESITANT TO TAKE IT INTO A DEALER AGAIN NOW AFTER READING SO ANY HORROR STORIES ABOUT HOW THE DEALERS ARE GUESSING ON HOW TO SOLVE THE ISSUES AND FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF NOT GETTING MY ISSUES RESOLVED BY THE DEALER.  I'M NOT BLAMING THE DEALER, BUT IT SEEMS THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS ENGINE.",

I CHECKED FOR RECALLS BUT DID NOT FIND ANY. I CALLED MICHELIN WHO IN TURN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  THE MAINTENANCE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD THE MICHELIN REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THE TIRES AND THE MICHELIN REPRESENTATIVE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.
