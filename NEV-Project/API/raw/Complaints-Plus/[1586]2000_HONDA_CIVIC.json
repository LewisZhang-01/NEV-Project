When we arrived home, we popped the hood and found out that all the 3 belts in the engine were off. We just called our insurance today Oct 17 to have it towed to our mechanic. This car passed state inspection last Aug 2022 and we were able to take off 1 belt which seems to be in good condition. We also had 1 belt replaced last 2020.",

I CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AT A STOP STREET, AND WAS ABOUT TO ACCELERATE AND MAKE A RIGHT TURN.  I STARTED MOVING AND THEN MY CAR WENT COMPLETELY DEAD AND STALLED.  I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, PUT IT IN PARK, AND THEN RESTART IT.  HOWEVER, FROM THAT POINT FORWARD, I FOUND AS I WOULD BE COMING TO A STOP AND IDLING, THAT THE CAR WOULD WANT TO GO COMPLETELY DEAD AND STALL ON ME.  I TOOK MY CAR TO OUR DEALERSHIP, AUTOSPORT HONDA, IN BRIDGEWATER, NJ, AND HAD THEM TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROBLEM.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS IN NEED OF A TUNE UP, AND THAT THE WIRES LEADING FROM THE IGNITION TO THE ENGINE WERE DETERIORATING.  I DECIDED TO LOOK MY VIN NUMBER UP TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS.  I FOUND, BASED ON THE HONDA CIVIC LX 4DR SEDANS, THAT THERE WAS A RECALL MAY 16, 2002 (CAMPAIGN NUMBER 02V120000) FOR THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE IGNITION SWITCH.  THE RECALL STATES \"ELECTRICAL CONTACTS IN THE IGNITION SWITCH CAN DEGRADE DUE TO THE HIGH ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE SWITCH WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED.\"  THE RECALL FURTHER STATES THAT \"WORN CONTACTS COULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL WITHOUT WARNING, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.\"  I BROUGHT THIS TO MY DEALERSHIPS ATTENTION, AND HE TOLD ME HE ALREADY RAN MY VIN NUMBER [XXX], AND THAT IT WAS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE RECALL.  I ASKED HIM IF THIS WAS THE SAME TYPE OF COMPONENT PROBLEM AS IN THE RECALL AND HE SAID YES.  HE SAID IT IS MORE COMMON IN STICK-SHIFT HONDAS THEN AUTOMATICS.  I AM BRINGING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE THE ISSUE I AM HAVING WITH MY VEHICLE IS THE SAME ISSUE THAT WAS RECALLED IN MAY 2002, EXCEPT UNDER DIFFERENT VIN NUMBERS.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, AND ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IT.  *NM   UPDATED 07/18/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

THE KEY GETS STUCK IN THE IGNITION AND NEEDS TO BE STARTED A COUPLE OF TIMES TO GET IT OUT.*AK    NEXT PROBLEM, THE CAR'S TRANSMISSION IS TERRIBLE.  VERY JUMPY ON HIGHWAY, ENGINE IS QUITE CLUMSY ON REGULAR ROAD DRIVING.    NOW THE MAIN PROBLEM WHY I HAVE COME HERE BECAUSE I FEEL I WAS WRONGED CONSIDERING I BOUGHT PRACTICALLY A NEW VEHICLE. (I WAS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD WHEN I HAD FIRST PURCHASED IT).  THIS BEING MY FIRST NEWER VEHICLE, I GUESS I CAN SAY I OWNED OLDER CARS THAT HELD TOGETHER MUCH BETTER.  THE CAR FOR THE PAST MONTH HAS BEEN VERY JUMPY ON THE HIGHWAY.  IT FEELS LIKE IT WANTS TO STALL WHEN DRIVING, WHICH MAKES ME FEEL VERY ENDANGERED WHEN DRIVING.  I RECENTLY FOUND OUT BY MY OWN EXPLORATION THAT THERE IS AN IGNITION SWITCH RECALL.  ACCORDING TO THE HONDA.COM WEBSITE THAT I REGISTERED WITH, THERE IS NO SAFETY RECALLS, (WHERE THEY FAIL TO MENTION ALL OTHER RECALLS).  NOTHING IS POSTED ON THIS.  I HAVE BEEN TO NUMEROUS MECHANICS AND FINALLY MAY HAVE FOUND THAT THE IGNITOR IS BAD.  FUNNY ENOUGH I KNOW 2 OTHER PEOPLE WITH HONDAS WHO HAVE REPLACED THEIR'S AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.    NOW, I CONTACTED THE LOCAL HONDA WITH NO HELP!  THEY TO CALL AMERICAN HONDA (WHICH I DID) AND APPARENTLY HONDA DECIDED TO RECALL \"SOME\" OF THE CARS WITH THESE IGNITOR'S IN THEM.    I WILL BE MAKING PLENTY OF CALLS TO GET HEARD. I THOUGHT THAT HONDA WAS A STABLE NAME.  APPARENTLY NOT SINCE THERE IS PLENTY OF COMPLAINTS IN THE AIR (WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED, BECAUSE THINGS DO GO WRONG).     ANYWAY,  I AM GLAD I GOT TO COMPLAIN HERE.  HOPEFULLY I WILL BE HEARD.  LET IT ALSO BE SAID, I AM A STRUGGLING COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WAS LOOKING TO ONLY BUY A STABLE CAR, AND INSTEAD GOT A WORLD OF HEADACHES!",

ALTERNATIVELY, HONDA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RETROFIT THE CARS WITH NON VOLATILE MEMORY SO THE CAR DOES NOT REQUIRE SUCH SERVICE.

FOR EXAMPLE, RIDING OVER BUMPS SUCH AS A RAILROAD SOMETIMES SETS THE ANTISKID OFF AND IT CONTINUES FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE RAILROAD HAS PASSED, THUS UNNECESSARILY INCREASING STOPPING DISTANCE.  SOMETIMES JUST ON PLAIN ROAD IT DOES THE SAME.  IT SEEMS TO OCCUR MORE IN COLD WEATHER.  WE HAVE A 2000 ACCORD AND IT DOESN'T ACT THIS WAY.  I HAVE DRIVEN MANY OTHER HONDA'S AND NONE EVER ACTED THIS WAY.  I AM AFRAID THIS MAJOR SAFETY DEFECT MAY SOMEDAY LEAD TO A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I HAVE COMPLAINED LONG AND HARD TO HONDA CORPORATION, BUT THEY INSIST THE DESCRIBED PROBLEM IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OCCUR.  THEY MAINTAIN THAT THE BRAKES ARE A 'BLACK BOX', AND EITHER WORK PERFECT OR NOT, ALL THE TIME.  THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE CAR, AND SAID SINCE THEY CLAIM THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SINCE IT CAN'T POSSIBLY OCCUR ANYWAY IN THEIR OPINION, I AM OUT OF LUCK.  SURELY MY HONDA IS NOT THE ONLY CAR THIS EVER OCCURRED IN.  IT IS ALMOST LIKE SOMETHING IS LOOSE, LIKE A SENSOR OR A RIGHT FRONT SUSPENSION COMPONENT(S). PLEASE HELP BEFORE HONDA CORPORATION KILLS SOMEONE.  I HAVE TOLD HONDA THAT I PERSONALLY HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENT.  THANKS.  J RICKY SIMMONS",

SUBSEQUENTLY THE DEALER STATES THAT THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY HAVE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE REAR BRAKES, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND TO THE WHEELS.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE DEALER AND HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE THEY CANOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.

I REALLY DIDNT GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT (FIGURED I WAS JUST NEEDING TO GET USED TO NEW TECHNOLOGY) UNTIL WHILE DRIVING AT SLOW SPEED (25 OR LESS) ON AN ICY CITY OF TULSA , OK, EVERTIME I APPLIED THE BRAKES GENTLY TO COME TO A STOP AT A STOP LIGHT THE FRONT BRAKES VIBRATED VIOLENTLY & LOCKED UP PREVENTING ME FROM COMING TO A SAFE STOP. ONCE THE BRAKES LOCKED THE CIVIC IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A SLIDE & ONLY STOPPED WHEN IT'S MOMENTUM SLOWED DOWN. THE BRAKES WERE ABSOLUTELY USELESS IN STOPPING THE VEHICLE BY GENTLY SLOWING IT DOWN AS HAS BEEN NORMAL WITH EVERY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED. I WAS SO AFRAID OF THE BRAKES THAT I TESTED THEM ON THE BUMPING GRAVEL ROAD JUST BEFORE I GOT HOME THAT AFTERNOON AND SURE ENOUGH THEY LOCKED UP AGAIN UNDER MORE PRESSURE THAN NEEDED UNDER NORMAL BRAKING CONDITIONS. I DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH DON CARLTON HONDA'S SERVICE SUPERVISOR TODAY (02/16/01) WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR IT'S OIL CHANGE. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS THE WAY HONDA'S ABS OPERATES AND THE BRAKES ARE DESIGNED FOR DRY WEATHER & SMOOTH ROAD CONDITIONS AND IF THE BRAKES EVER SENSE SLIPPING OR ROUGH CONDITIONS THEY WILL \"ALWAYS\" LOCK UP BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIGN AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FIXED OR THAT CAN BE DONE BY HONDA TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I FIND THIS EXPLANATION \"ABSURD\" AND \"RIDICULOUS\" -HOW COULD BRAKES THIS DANGEROUS BE CONSIDERED NORMAL. THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T PLOW INTO SOMEONE THAT ICY DAY IS BECAUSE LUCKILY FOR ANYONE ELSE & ME THERE WAS NO CAR OR PERSON IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I TRIED TO STOP ON THE ICY CITY STREET.

LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND QUICKLY PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY.  UPON INSPECTION, ONLY THE OUTER EDGE OF THE TIRE REMAINED ON THE RIM.  THE ENTIRE TREAD PORTION OF THE TIRE WAS GONE.  ALL FOUR TIRES HAD ADEQUATE PRESSURE, WERE ROTATED AT 7500 MILES BY HENRICK HONDA, AND WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW LATE LAST YEAR.  I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED FIRESTONE AND FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE A CLAIM.  RECENTLY, I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FIRESTONE DENYING MY REQUEST FOR COMPENSATION, SITING INSUFFICIENT AIR PRESSURE EVIDENCED BY THE TATTERED SIDEWALLS AND MELTED INNER LINER.  AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY, THESE TIRES WERE NOT LOW ON PRESSURE AND WERE KEPT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  THE SEVERITY OF THIS FAILURE COUPLED WITH FIRESTONE'S UNWILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION IS THE REASON I'M FILING THIS COMPLAINT.

THE ENGINE SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT WAS TRYING TO START ITSELF, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STILL RUNNING.  I PUT THE KEY BACK IN AND TURNED IT TO THE \"ON\" POSITION, AT WHICH POINT THE UNUSUAL NOISE DISAPPEARED, AND THE CAR SEEMED TO IDLE NORMALLY.  I TURNED IT OFF AGAIN, AND THE NOISE RETURNED AS THE CAR KEPT RUNNING.  I TURNED THE KEY ON AND OFF A FEW TIMES BEFORE THE ENGINE FINALLY STOPPED.  AS I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, I NOTICED SMOKE RISING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW THAT A FIRE WAS BURNING ON THE STARTER AND THE NEARBY RUBBER HOSES.  I UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO BLOW OUT THE FLAMES, WHICH WE PUT OUT USING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER FROM OUR APARTMENT BUILDING, WHICH WE WERE PARKED IN FRONT OF.  ALL DAMAGED PARTS WERE REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL A BURNT SMELL EVIDENT AFTER DRIVING THE CAR.  I INFORMED HONDA OF THE PROBLEM THROUGH THEIR \"NEW OWNER SURVEY\" AND A LETTER TO THEIR CUSTOMER RELATIONS ZONE OFFICE.  *AK",

ALIGNMENT DONE, STILL SLIGHT RIGHT PULL AND DEFINITE WANDERING STILL PRESENT.  RETURNED TODAY FOR RECHECK.  MECHANIC TEST DROVE WITH ME IN CAR.  HE ACKNOWLEDGES WANDERING/WASHBOARDING, BUT CLAIMS HE DOESN'T FEEL IT IS ABNORMAL.  ANOTHER MECHANIC TOOK ME OUT FOR A DRIVE TO DETERMINE SOURCE OF PROBLEM, ME OR THE CAR.  MECHANIC DETERMINED UNUSUAL WASHBOARDING.  STATES WILL CONTACT HONDA TECH. FOR ASSISTANCE WITH PROBLEM.  AFTER I LEFT, SVC. WRITER AND SECOND MECHANIC TOOK ANOTHER CIVIC FOR TEST DRIVE.  EXPERIENCED SAME PROBLEM WITH HAVING TO CONSTANTLY CORRECT STEERING TO KEEP VEHICLE IN ITS OWN LANE.  CALLED ME JUST BEFORE 5PM P.S.T. TO ASK ME WHAT I WOULD DO IF THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CIVIC'S SINCE ANOTHER NEW CAR ON THE LOT DROVE THE SAME WAY.  I RESPONDED STATING I SAW NOTHING IN THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS THAT WARNED ME OF A \"STEERING CHARACTERISTIC\" THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH, NOR DID I KNOW HONDA MADE THEIR CARS WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE CASTER OR CAMBER ADJUSTMENTS CORRECTED.  IF I KNEW THIS CAR WAS GOING TO HANDLE AS POORLY ON THE FREEWAY AS IT DOES, I WOULDN'T HAVE PURCHASED IT.  THE SPECIFICATIONS IN THE OWNERS MANUAL CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MET DUE TO THE LACK OF FORESIGHT BY HONDA.  I HAVE A COPY OF THE ALIGNMENT SETTINGS BEFORE THE FIRST ALIGNMENT WAS INITIATED AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST ALIGNMENT, WHICH ARE UNACCEPTABLE BASED ON THE UNSTABLE, UNPREDICTABLE STEERING AND HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS EXHIBITED BY THIS \"NEW\" CAR.  IF HONDA CAN NOT FIX THIS CAR CORRECTLY SO AS NOT TO SHORTEN THE LIFE OF THE TIRES OR PUT UNDUE STRESS ON THE FRONT SUSPENSION, REAR SUSPENSION, AND RELATED WHEEL BEARINGS, THEN THEY CAN JUST TAKE THIS CAR BACK AND REIMBURSE ME FOR MY PURCHASE.  I HAVE ALREADY WASTED 3 HOURS BUYING THIS CAR AND OVER 5 HOURS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DEALING WITH THE CURRENT PROBLEM. *",
