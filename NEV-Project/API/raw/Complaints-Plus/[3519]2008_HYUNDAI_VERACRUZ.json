Called early January 2022 part was not in; 1/19/2022 engine light  came on and car tugged as I entered my neighborhood: contacted service department to inform engine light was now on; was informed parts were in and to bring car in; brought car in never received call from service; call managing partner Cam Stewart was informed parts were not in for recall and engine failed-was asked if I wanted to trade the car in; replied no I would like the car repaired.  Car remained in service who informed the engine failure was not a result of recall. Filed complaint with Hyundai Motor Services, Hyundai Motor Services stood by claim. The recall letter indicates the engine could shut off as a result of recall not being repaired. The time frame of prolonging the repair, in my opinion, is a direct result of car failure. Hyundai has failed and is unwilling to remedy the defect within a reasonable time.",

HYUNDAI REPLACED THE ORIGINAL VALVE COVER GASKET UNDER RECALL ON NOVEMBER 25, 2014.  THE RECALL WAS BASED ON OIL LEAKS AND ALTERNATOR FAILURES.  HYUNDAI WOULD NOT REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR EVEN THOUGH IT WAS COVERED IN OIL AT THAT TIME. A FEW YEARS LATER, OUR ALTERNATOR FAILED (APRIL 2019). WE PAID A MECHANIC $750 TO REPLACE THAT ALTERNATOR. THE MECHANIC STATED FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY OIL SATURATION.  HYUNDAI HAS ISSUED ANOTHER RECALL FOR THE SAME ISSUE, BUT NO RESOLUTION HAS BEEN DETERMINED. I RECENTLY HAD ANOTHER MECHANIC LOOK AT THE VEHICLE AND THEY MENTIONED THE VALVE COVER GASKET IS LEAKING OIL ON THE NEWER ALTERNATOR AND THE ALTERNATOR IS COVERED IN OIL AGAIN. I CONTACTED HYUNDAI AFTER RECEIVING MULTIPLE RECALL NOTICES STARTING IN NOVEMBER 2020 AND A REIMBURSEMENT CLAIM WAS FILED.  HYUNDAI DENIED MY CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE I DID NOT PROVIDE A VALID REASON.  HYUNDAI IS STILL SENDING ME RECALL NOTICES, BUT THEY CLAIM TO NOT HAVE A FIX FOR THE ISSUE.  I AM FORCED TO CLEAN THE ALTERNATOR OFF MONTHLY TO AVOID FAILURE.  PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS.",

THE ISSUE OCCURRED WHERE THE CAR WOULD NOT START, AND WOULD FLASH MANY SYMBOLS ON THE DASHBOARD. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT I WOULD PULL THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WAIT A COUPLE OF SECONDS, AND THE CAR WOULD START AGAIN. WE WENT TO OUR LOCAL AUTO SERVICE ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT TOLD US THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE A BIG ISSUE. AND WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURRED THE SECOND TIME, I TOOK THE CAR TO HYUNDAI SERVICES TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS JUST A FLUKE AND THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURRED THE THIRD TIME, SIMILARLY TO THE FIRST AND SECOND TIME, THE CAR STOPPED RUNNING AND THE SYMBOLS FLASHED. BUT THIS TIME, THE ENGINE STARTED TO SMOKE AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START NO MATTER HOW LONG I WAITED. THIS LED MY FAMILY TO BE STUCK IN THE HIGHWAY AND HAD TO CALL A TOW SERVICE TO PICK OUR CAR UP. WHEN WE TOLD HYUNDAI, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT A ROD WHICH WAS A PART OF THE ENGINE, IMPALED THE ENGINE MOTOR AND MADE A QUARTER SIZED HOLE, WHICH LEAKED GASOLINE FROM THE CAR. WE TOLD HYUNDAI THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE RECALL, BUT THEY DENIED AND SAID THAT WE MUST PAY FOR AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT. WE FEEL WRONGED BY HYUNDAI AS THESE ISSUES OCCURRED AFTER THE RECALL, AND THE CAR ONLY HAS 124,00 MILES ON IT. MY FAMILY ALSO TOOK EXTENSIVE CARE OF THE CAR THROUGHOUT THE 10 YEARS WE HAVE HAD THIS CAR. MY FAMILY AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT OTHER VERACRUZ OWNERS MIGHT HAVE HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE AS OURS, SO WE HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR SITUATION. THANK YOU.",

DEALER FOUND LEAK DURING OIL CHANGE AND ATTEMPTED TO SEAL WITH A SILICONE.  THAT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND VALVE COVER GASKET WAS REPLACED.  A YEAR PLUS LATER  I WAS DRIVING HOME WHEN I COULD NOT GOT FASTER THAT 35 MPH.  WHEN I DROVE INTO MY DEVELOPMENT, THE MAX SPEED WAS 10 MPH.  I BARELY GOT INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND THE CAR STOPPED.  IT TURNED OUT THAT OIL FROM A LEAKING VALVE COVER GASKET HAD SHORTED THE ALTERNATOR AND THE CAR HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THE BATTERY.  CAR WAS TOWED AND BOTH THE ALTERNATOR AND VALVE COVER GASKET WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. IN 2014, THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE LEAKING VALVE COVER GASKET PROBLEM AND MY CAR WAS REPAIRED AGAIN.  IN NOVEMBER OF 2018, THE SERVICE TECH AT O'BRIEN HYUNDAI FOUND AN OIL LEAK DURING AN OIL CHANGE BUT WAS UNCERTAIN OF THE SOURCE.  HE PUT A DYE IN THE OIL AND REQUESTED THAT I RETURN AFTER 2000 MILES SO HE COULD INSPECT FOR THE LEAK SOURCE.  I TOOK IT BACK AFTER 2 WEEKS AND WAS TOLD THAT THE LEAK WAS FROM THE TIMING CHAIN COVER GASKET.  HOWEVER, THE TIMING CHAIN COVER GASKET, THE VALVE COVER GASKET, THE WATER PUMP AND THE ALTERNATOR WERE ALL REPLACED UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY.  IN SEPTEMBER, THE \"NEW\" ALTERNATOR FAILED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH A DRIVE BELT AT MY EXPENSE.      THE FACT THAT THE VALVE COVER GASKET HAS BEEN REPLACED MULTIPLE TIMES IN MY VEHICLE MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT THE ENGINE DESIGN HAS A LATENT DEFECT WHICH CAN AND HAS RESULTED IN MY VEHICLE LOSING POWER WHILE IN USED CREATING A POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION.
