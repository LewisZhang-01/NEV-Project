My car is in pieces and they are waiting for a back ordered pump.

A Special Coverage Adjustment was issued by Chevrolet, ref #N150682, GWM #2015682 in January 2017 which extended the factory warranty to 10 years or 120,000 miles. I purchased this vehicle in July 2020 which exceeds that extended warranty. The fuel odor is a major problem as the vehicle is parked inside a closed garage and the vapors are strong enough to enter the house. Also the fuel odor is present inside the cabin as the vehicle is being driven. Chevrolet has not issued a recall on the dangerous problem and is unwilling to work with me on what will end up being an extremely expensive repair. Their best estimate is that the plastic OEM fitting on the downstream side of the fuel pump has a minor fracture causing fuel to spew out on top of the fuel tank where it eventually evaporates, leaving no evidence of fuel leaks under the car. This problem has been acknowledged by GM as the factory warranty was extended to cover repairs of a known factory issue causing the fuel leaks.",

THE NEXT MORNING, I CHECKED THE LIGHTS AGAIN AND TRIED ALL POSITIONS OF THE SWITCH ON MY STEERING COLUMN, AND THE HEADLIGHTS WORKED. ONCE I STARTED DRIVING THE CAR THE HEADLIGHTS QUIT WORKING AGAIN. AGAIN, ALL OTHER LIGHTS WERE STILL WORKING INCLUDING MY TAIL LIGHTS, FOG LIGHTS, AND HIGH BEAMS. LATER IN THE EVENING THE NEXT DAY, THE HEADLIGHTS CAME ON WHEN THE COLUMN SWITCH WAS IN THE AUTO POSITION, AND THEY STAYED ON DURING A 20-MINUTE DRIVE DOWN THE FREEWAY.

I LEFT IT OUTSIDE OF MY GARAGE UNTIL I DIDNT NOTICE THE SMELL ANYMORE AT WHICH POINT I PARKED IT INSIDE THE GARAGE.  I NOTICED THAT THE ISSUE ONLY STARTS WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN HALF A TANK OF GAS.  ONCE THE FUEL GAUGE DROPS TO UNDER HALF A TANK, THE SMELL GOES AWAY.  I TOOK IT TO TWO SEPARATE DEALERSHIPS THAT DID SMOKE TESTS AND VISUAL CHECKS AND THEY DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUES, EVEN THOUGH THE SMELL IS THERE WITH MORE THAN HALF A TANK (IN BOTH OCCASIONS THE TANKS WERE MORE THAN HALF AND THE DEALER NOTICED THE SMELL BUT DID NOT SEE ANY ISSUES AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO MY VEHICLE RUNNING RICH, EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM THE SMELL WENT AWAY WHEN THE FUEL GAUGE WAS UNDER HALF A TANK).  IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE, A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT SINCE GAS FUMES ARE HIGHLY FLAMMABLE AND THE HOT EXHAUST PIPES RUN IN BETWEEN THE TANKS THEMSELVES.

NEXT, THERE WAS A SOUND LIKE A THUMP.  MY DASHBOARD LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE WITH A WARNING THAT TRACTION CONTROL WAS NOT WORKING AND THAT I SHOULD SEEK IMMEDIATE REPAIR.  NEXT, THE VEHICLE LOST A LOT OF ITS POWER AND DECELERATED RATHER SUDDENLY FORM 70 TO APPROX 45 MPH.  CAR HAD NO ENERGY OR PEP AND LIGHT SAID ENGINE POWER LOSS.  FORTUNATELY NOBODY WAS BEHIND ME WHEN  THE DECELERATION OCCURRED.  I EXITED THE EXPRESSWAY AND WAS JUST  FEW MILES FROM HOTEL AND PARKED IT. HAD IT TOWED THE NEXT DAY TO A DEALER IN TAMPA.  DO NOT YET KNOW DIAGNOSIS ON THE CAR.  WILL PROBABLY HEAR TOMORROW.  BUT IT WAS A REAL SHOCK TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN SO SUDDENLY AND THE DECELERATION WAS SUDDEN AND IF CAR HAD BEEN BEHIND ME IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.  *TR",
