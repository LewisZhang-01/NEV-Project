THE MODULE HAS STAYED ON AND THE ABS LIGHT IS ON ALWAYS. I TRIED TO GET GM TO OWN UP TO THE FAULTY PART BUT THEY REFUSED. I THINK IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT GM PUTS LOW QUALITY ELECTRONIC PARTS IN THEIR VEHICLES, AND CHARGES SO MUCH FOR THE PARTS. THE EBCM COSTS OVER 900 DOLLARS WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY. WHEN YOU PAY OVER 30,000 FOR A TRUCK YOU EXPECT IT TO LAST A LONG TIME. BUT GM IS NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING QUALITY ANYMORE. GM TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A VERY UNCOMMON PROBLEM, WRONG, ON THE WEB I FOUND MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND IN FACT THERE IS A REBUILD KIT FOR THEM.

I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF A (GMC SIERRA Z-71, 4X4 WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGED AND ONLY HAS 66,000 MILES.

I PERFORM MOST REPAIRS MYSELF BUT SINCE THIS INVOLVED REMOVING THE AXLE IT WAS BEYOND MY CAPABILITY.  THE COST OF THIS REPAIR AT BOB ROSS GMC WAS $222.00 WHICH I PAID.  I AM WRITING GMC BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE A PART SUCH AS THIS BRAKE SHIELD SHOULD RUST SO BAD AS TO FALL APART AND HAVE RUSTED THROUGH HOLES (SEE ATTACHED PHOTO) IN ONLY 6  YEARS.  I HAVE INSPECTED THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR BRAKE SHIELD AND ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS BAD AS THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR BRAKE SHIELD, IT IS EXTREMELY RUSTY AND PROBABLY WILL FAIL AND NEED REPLACED IN THE NEXT YEAR.  MY POSITION IS THIS IS A MATERIAL DESIGN FLAW THAT GM SHOULD INVESTIGATE.     FAILURE OF THIS PART, AS IN MY CASE, WILL ALLOW THE ELEMENTS (WATER, SNOW, DIRT, ROCKS, ETC.) TO DAMAGE THE BRAKE ROTOR AND ULTIMATELY CAUSE PREMATURE BRAKE WEAR AND FAILURE.  THE BRAKE SHIELDS ON THE FRONT BRAKES HAVE NO RUST, AS I WOULD EXPECT OF A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 6 YEARS OLD.

I WAS ADVISED TO CONTACT GM OF THE ACCIDENT AS THERE IS A RECALL IN CANADA (PRODUCT SAFETY BULLETIN [PSB]- FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSOR CORROSION #04094 DATED JANUARY 25, 2005) FOR BRAKE FAILURE.  GM REPRESENTATIVES SENT A FACT FINDER TO DETERMINE IF THE PROBLEM WAS THE WHEEL SENSOR.  THE BODY DAMAGE REPAIR ESTIMATE TO MY TRUCK IS $2,902.86 AND $1,907.79 TO THE BLAZER.  THE ESTIMATES WERE FAXED TO GM AND WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE REPORT INDICATED THERE WAS A PROBLEM BUT, SINCE THE DAMAGES WERE OVER $1,000.00 THE CASE HAD TO BE REFERRED TO RISK MANAGEMENT.  RISK MANAGEMENT STATED THE FACT FINDERS REPORT DID NOT INDICATE A PROBLEM WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO WHAT I WAS TOLD PREVIOUSLY.  I REQUESTED A COPY OF THE REPORT AND WAS DENIED AS IT IS CONSIDERED PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.  I INFORMED RISK MANAGEMENT THAT A TSB HAD BEEN ISSUED WHICH THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE UNAWARE OF.  RISK MANAGEMENT OFFERED TO PAY 50% OF THE DAMAGES.  I CALLED THE ORIGINAL CONTACT PERSON AT GM AND WAS TOLD THE REPORT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NOT A CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEM HOWEVER, THE HISTORY CODE SHOWS THAT THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSOR WAS MISSING - DROPPED OUT OF CIRCUIT - INDICATING THAT THERE HAS BEEN PAST PROBLEMS WITH THE WHEEL SENSOR.    SINCE THE ACCIDENT I BORROWED MY MOTHER'S CAR AND WAS ASKED TO RETURN IT SO, I DROVE MY TRUCK THROUGH A 40 MPH ZONE, MY HOOD FLEW OPEN BREAKING THE HINGES.  I HAVE NOT HAD MY TRUCK OR MY GIRLFRIEND'S BLAZER FIXED AS I AM UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO.

I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD. I FINALLY TOOK IT TO BOWSER GMC IN PLEASANT HILLS PA. THEY REPAIRED THE TRUCK BY REPLACING THE FRONT HUBS AND SENSORS. WITH THIS REPAIR AND THE PREVIOUS COMPLETE BRAKE JOB INCLUDING BRAKES AND ROTORS THIS EPISODE COST MORE THAN $1400. AT THE TIME THE TRUCK HAD 36,000 MILES ON IT.   ON 7/20/05 I BEGAN TO NOTICE THE BRAKE CHATTER RETURNING. JUST A SLIGHT CHATTER COMING TO A STOP AT RED LIGHTS ON INCLINES, THEN ON THE LEVEL AND FINALLY ON 7/23/05 I ALMOST CRASHED INTO MY HOUSE AS I PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY. THE SAME PROBLEM HAD RETURNED, THE TRUCK NOW HAS 47,000 MILES. IT APPEARS THAT MY $800 HUB REPLACEMENT WAS DONE WITH THE SAME FAULTY HUB ASSEMBLY. THE SAME PROBLEM HAS RETURNED ONLY IN LESS TIME. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE HAD WITH THE BRAKES ON THIS TRUCK, I JUST RECENTLY AT 46,000 MILES HAD TO HAVE THE REAR ROTORS AND PADS REPLACED DUE TO RUSTED BRAKE PARTS. SO OVER THE COURSE OF 5 YEARS I HAVE REPLACED 6 BRAKE ROTORS, 6 SETS OF PADS, TWO HUBS AND TWO SENSOR ASSEMBLIES.   I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CLOSE CALLS WITH THIS TRUCK COMING WITHIN INCHES OF CRASHING INTO BUILDINGS AND OTHER CARS. AT TIMES I HAVE HAD TO THROW THE VEHICLE INTO PARK TO STOP FROM HITTING SOMETHING. I HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND I AM DISGUSTED THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM SINCE I FIRST REPORTED IT IN 2002.

I WENT AHEAD AND HAD THE ABS MOTOR REPLACED FOR $1087.34.  I WROTE TO GM AND ASKED FOR SOME TYPE OF COMPENSATION DO TO THE LOW MILAGE AND THE FACT THAT THE LEASE WASN'T EVEN UP ON THE VEHICLE.  THEY RESPONDED WITH A RESOUNDING \"GET LOST\".  I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THROUGH A MECHANIC, I FOUND OUT THAT NUMEROUS OF THESE MOTORS HAVE FAILED.  I CONTACTED A COMPETITOR DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE FAILURE OF THE ABS MOTOR WAS \"NOT UNCOMMON\" BUT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE A FIGURE.  MY QUESTION IS TO YOU, DO YOU HAVE THE MEANS TO INQUIRE HOW MANY OF THESE MOTORS HAVE FAILED?  ALSO IF THE RECALL WAS FOR 2000 SIERRA'S, WITH ENOUGH COMPLAINTS, COULD THAT ALSO INCLUDE SOME OTHER YEAR MODELS?  THE DEALER HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE AS TO MAKING ANY TYPE OF COMPENSATION.

ON 10/24/01 I CONTACTED SEVERAL SERVICE CENTERS CONCERNING REPAIRING THIS PROBLEM AND LEARNED THAT THIS IS BECOMING A COMMON FAILURE IN THIS MODEL/MAKE OF TRUCK (CHEVY'S ALSO) AT THE APPROXIMATE SAME MILEAGE AS I AM AT.  THE REPAIR IS EXTREMELY COSTLY AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE ABS IS INTREGRATED INTO THE VEHICLE IT CANNOT BE DISCONNECTED.  I HAVE DISCOUNTED AUTO INSURANCE BECAUSE THE ABS IS ON THIS VEHICLE, STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY.  I SEARCHED FOR A RECALL, OR ANY INFORMATION,. ON GM'S WEBSITE BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING RELATED TO THE ABS FAILURE.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS VERY IMPORANT SAFETY FEATURE IS FAILING IN MANY OF THIS MAKE/MODEL/YEAR TRUCK AND THAT A RECALL SHOULD BE DONE.

BRAKE PEDAL GOES TO THE FLOOR MAKING A CHATTERING NOISE AND STOPPING DISTANCE IS INCREASED. THIS PROBLEM PREVENTS THE DRIVER FROM STOPPING VEHICLE BEFORE STRICKING ANOTHER VEHICLE OR ENTERING AN INTERSECTION AT THE RISK OF CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. THIS IS NOT HOW A \"NORMAL\" ABS SYSTEM OPERATES AND IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW THAT GM NEEDS TO ADDRESS BEFORE SOMEONE IS NEEDLESSLY INJURED OR KILLED! I'VE HAD THIS TRUCK FOR ONE MONTH AND I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT NOW BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY ABS BRAKE SYSTEM. THE DRIVETRAIN MAKES A GROANING SOUND WHILE IN 4WD MODE AND THE TRUCK SOMETIMES DOESN'T WANT TO MOVE WITHOUT GREAT EFFORT EVEN ON DRY PAVEMENT. THIS CONDITION DOES NOT EXIST WHEN 4WD IS DISENGAGED. THE TRUCK HAS MANUAL 4WD WITH 4.10 REAR END WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. THIS PROBLEM IS NOT RELATED TO THE ABS FAILURE.  *AK",
