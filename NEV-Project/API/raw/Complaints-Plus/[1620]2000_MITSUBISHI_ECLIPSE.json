SHE SAID THE RECALL WAS FOR CARS MANUFACTURED UP UNTIL OCTOBER FOR THE YEAR AND MINE WAS MANUFACTURED IN NOVEMBER (1 MONTH LATER).  SHE SAID ALTHOUGH I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEMS STATED IN THE RECALL EXACTLY, MY CAR WASN'T ELIGIBLE.  I HAD TO PAY $135.00 TO GET THE LEVER REPLACED.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AS TURN SIGNAL LEVERS DO NOT BREAK (ESPECIALLY AT 6 YEARS OLD) AND THE FACT THAT MY MODEL AND YEAR CAR HAS A RECALL ON IT FOR THE EXACT THING I EXPERIENCED BUT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT INCLUDED.

IN 2003, MY CLEAR COAT STARTED COMING OFF AND IS VERY BAD NOW AS MY CAR IS BLACK AND THE AFFECTED AREAS ARE WHITE.  ALSO, MY DASHBOARD HAS SEVERE CRACKS ALL OVER WHICH STARTED IN 2004 AND MY GLOVE BOX DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE PLASTIC BROKE AROUND THE LOCK BROKE AND I HAVE TO MANUALLY OPEN IT WITH SOME TOOLS.  I CALLED MITSUBISHI ABOUT THE PAINT WHEN IT STARTED TO HAPPEN BACK IN 2003 AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS DUE TO \"THE ELEMENTS\" AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.
