I tried to restart, put the truck in the drive, but it wouldn't go like the gas wasn't reaching. So, I turned it off and restarted to see if the lights would go off, but it didn't. I was able to get it home safely. It doesn't take off right away when you gas the pedal. When I stop at the stop sign, it takes a minute before it starts moving again. This is not safe to drive, especially when making a turn, pulling off to traffic. If it doesn't take off in time, it could be an accident due this problem. I hope there's a solution this problem.

Has not been confirmed by the dealership yet that\u2019s my next step. And yes it can be reproduced at any time. Sometimes the key will not even start the vehicle. Hi had never reached over and just tried to take the keys out of the ignition to see if they would come out but I recently rented a room where the owner has the exact same car and the same thing happened to him and he had the ignition replaced. This is how I know that it happens because he reached over and was able to pull my keys right out with the vehicle running. I was shocked. Also at one point it says there is automatic transmission recall and mine is making weird movements and jerking motions sometimes not just on my car but on my landlord\u2019s car as well.

THE JOKE OF IT ALL IS THAT THE REAR BRAKES ARE STILL THE ORIGINAL BRAKES AND STAND AT THE LAST INSPECTION AT 8/32. THIS TELLS ME THAT THE BRAKE DISTRIBUTION EQUALIZER IS NOT WORKING. ALL MY STOPPING POWER IS ON THE FRONT BRAKES. MY EQUINOX IS 10 YEARS OLD. SURELY BY NOW THE REAR BRAKES SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED A FEW TIMES. THERE IS ONLY 38,300 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE NOW AND IT LOOKS LIKE NEW. I TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CARE OF MY VEHICLES.

I DISCOVERED WHAT SHUT CAR DOWN WHEN I STARTED SQUIRTING WATER ONTO ROOF AT A CAR WASH AND WATER STARTED DRIPPING DOWN ONTO CARPET FLOORING BUT FIRST IT SEEPED INTO COMPUTER CONTROL UNIT.  I WAITED OUT DRYING OF UNIT AND THEN DROVE HOME AND APPLIED A LOT CAULK TO SUNROOF WHERE GLASS MEET METAL/RUBBER.  CAR EXTERIOR ROOF NOW LOOKS TERRIBLE AS CAULK DRIED SORT OF A BROWN CRUD COLOR (CAR IS WHITE) BUT NO MORE (KNOCK ON WOOD) ENGINE STALLING WHEN IT RAINS OR I GO THROUGH A CAR WASH.  MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS WHEN ON ROAD AND IN RAIN.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD ONE THING THEN ANOTHER. I WAS VERY FRUSTRATED AND CALLED GM TO COMPLAIN TO THEM THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL. THEY WERE GOING TO CALL ME BACK AND NEVER ANOTHER WORD FROM THEM. I EXPLAINED TO INS. AND TO GM, AND ALSO TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSION THAT THIS WAS A HAZARD ON THE ROAD DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CAR WAS FOGGING UP FROM INSIDE AND I HAD ICE ON THE INSIDE OF THE CAR DUE TO COLD WEATHER.I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS ONGOING PROBLEM. I AM SENDING ALL DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THIS ISSUE.  *TR  ## VIN PASSED ##",

SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THIS VEHICLE, I HAVE SPENT NEARLY 3000 DOLLARS IN REPAIRS AS IT SEEMS THAT PARTS ARE WEARING OUT OR MALFUNCTIONING FAR EARLIER THAN TYPICAL.    AT ABOUT THE 60000 MILE MARK, ALL FOUR ROTORS AND BRAKES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE ROTORS BEING WARPED.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THAT THIS IS NOT COMMON AND SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT THIS TYPE OF MILEAGE.  COST FOR THIS REPAIR WAS ABOUT $500.  TIRES HAVE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED TWICE SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THIS VEHICLE; ONCE AROUND 60000 MILES DUE TO \"UNEVEN WEAR\" WHICH WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF THE BAD ROTORS, AND AGAIN AROUND THE 100000 MARK ALSO FOR \"UNEVEN WEAR\".  THIS COST $400 ON EACH OCCASION.  AT THE 80000 MILE MARK A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE FRONT END, AND PROCEEDED TO GET WORSE UP TO THE 100000 MILE MARK.  BETWEEN THOSE MILEAGE MARKS, THE FRONT END BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LOOSE.  THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE STRUTS PREMATURELY FAILED AND CREATED A VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITION.  THE COST FOR THIS REPAIR WAS OVER $1300 AND WAS REPAIRED ON JUNE 27, 2011.  AFTER DOING A BIT OF RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A VERY PROMINENT AND COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL.    ON TOP OF THESE ISSUES, THERE IS ALSO APPARENTLY A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR END AS WELL THAT IS ALSO CREATING A KNOCKING.  ALSO, THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS HAVE BEGUN TO FLASH REPEATEDLY AND VERY QUICKLY AT RANDOM TIMES AS WELL AS TURNING THEMSELVES ON AND OFF.  THE CD PLAYER ALSO BROKE.    I FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE AND UNRELIABLE VEHICLE THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS TRULY DUE TO \"WEAR AND TEAR\", OR IF THIS IS A FACTORY FAULT. *TR",

PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, THERE APPEARED TO BE A SLOW LOSS OF COOLANT, REQUIRING A GALLON OF COOLANT TO BE ADDED OVER THE PREVIOUS THREE MONTH PERIOD. THERE WERE NO LEAKS ON THE GARAGE FLOOR, NOR ANY INTERIOR CABIN LEAKS APPARENT, BUT THERE HAD BEEN A \"SYRUPY\" SMELL IN THE PASSENGER CABIN.  THE DEALER PUT IN A NEW BATTERY AND ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE HEATER CORE WAS LEAKING. THE NEW BATTERY AND HEATER CORE REPLACEMENT TOTALED $1090.11.  APPARENTLY, WHEN THE BATTERY DIED, THE DIAGNOSTICS CODES RELATING TO THIS INCIDENT WERE LOST.    03/16/2011 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  THIS HAS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST BUT HAD ALWAYS BEEN RELATED TO A LOOSE GAS CAP AND WAS EASILY REMEDIED BY TIGHTENING THE CAP.  WHEN THAT SOLUTION DID NOT WORK, THE EQUINOX WAS TAKEN INTO THE LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP. IT WAS THEN DIAGNOSED  AS NEEDING A HEAD GASKET REPLACEMENT, WHERE IT IS NOW BEING REPAIRED.  THE REPAIR TOTAL IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $1400.     IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS, THIS VEHICLE (WITH ONLY 68K MILES ON IT) HAS REQUIRED AT LEAST $2400 DOLLARS IN HEATER CORE AND ENGINE HEAD GASKET REPAIR COSTS.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE HEATER CORE LEAKS WERE LIKELY TO HAVE HAD THE SUBSEQUENT EFFECT OF COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF THE HEAD GASKET. I HAVE FOUND MANY DOCUMENTED REFERENCES TO SIMILAR PROBLEMS OCCURRING IN THIS ENGINE MAKE, THE 3.4L GM V6. THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE A RELATED LINK TO PROBLEMS WITH THE TYPE OF COOLANT USED IN THIS ENGINE (DEX COOL).  AT THIS POINT, I AM NOT AWARE THAT GM HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS PROBLEM.

TOOK IT BACK TO GM AND THEY FLUSHED THE SYSTEM. ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, IT WAS BROUGHT BACK IN BECAUSE THE HEAT WAS NOT BLOWING AGAIN. FOR THE 2ND TIME THEY REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT. FOLLOWING YEAR, WOULDN'T BLOW HOT AIR AGAIN, THEY FLUSHED THE SYSTEM 3 TIMES AND FINALLY GOT THE HEAT WORKING AGAIN. FAST FORWARD TO FALL 2010. SAME PROBLEM, NOT BLOWING HEAT ONLY THIS TIME THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.   GM DIAGNOSED A CRACKED HEAD GASKET AND A LEAKY WATER PUMP AND WOULDN'T COVER ANY OF THE SO CALLED PROBLEMS.  THE FIRST 3-4 TIMES THAT THE CAR WAS IN TO BE WORKED ON IT HAD THE SAME \"SYMPTOMS\" 1. WHEN THE HEAT WAS WORKING AND I SLOWED TO STOP - IT WOULD START BLOWING COOL AIR, BUT AS SOON AS I ACCELERATED, THE WARM AIR RETURNED. 2. IF I TURNED THE FAN KNOB PAST THE 2ND TICK, IT WOULD START BLOWING COLD AIR.  IN 2010, STARTED WITH THE ABOVE SYMPTOMS AND ONLY TO HAVE THE HEAT GO OUT COMPLETELY. GM WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.THIS GO AROUND DIAGNOSED A CRACKED HEAD GASKET AND A LEAKY WATER PUMP AND WOULDN'T HELP PAY TO FIX BECAUSE IT WAS A \"NEW\" DIAGNOSIS OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY. FUNNY HOW EACH TIME IT WAS IN PREVIOUSLY, THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS ARE DOCUMENT IN THEIR SYSTEM AND NO CRACKED HEAD GASKET OR LEAKY WATER PUMP WAS THE CAUSE. THEY'RE SKIRTING BY ON AN UNDERLYING ISSUE AND AREN'T WARRANTING THEIR PRODUCT!  WE'VE SINCE TAKEN IT TO TWO SEPARATE MECHANICS AND THEY'VE BOTH TOLD US THE ISSUE ISN'T CAUSED BY A CRACKED HEAD GASKET OR LEAKY WATER PUMP. WE'VE AGAIN REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT ONLY TO HAVE THE HEAT GO OUT ON OUR 3 HOUR CAR RIDE HOME FROM THE HOLIDAY WITH A BABY IN THE CAR-NICE GM YOU ARE A JOKE. I'VE ALWAYS OWNED A GM PRODUCT BUT AFTER BEING SWEPT UNDER THE RUG, I WILL NEVER BUY ONE AGAIN!",

EXCEPT THAT IT'S MY PROBLEM AND WILL COST $800.00 TO REPAIR.    THIS SUMMER I NOTICED THAT THE INTERIOR WINDOWS ON MY WIFE'S CAR WERE FOGGING UP THE CARPET IN THE BACK SEAT WAS WET.

WHEN THEY GOT HOME I REMOVED THE TRUNK AREA COVERS AND FOUND 2 TO 3 GALLONS OF WATER IN THE SPARE TIRE WELL .REMOVED THE WATER AND AIR DRIED THE CARPET . NOW EVERY TIME IT RAINS THE AREA FILLS UP AND I REMOVE IT , THIS HAS BEEN A WET YEAR.   REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE PRIORITY CHEVY DEALER ON MILITARY HIGHWAY  AND VARIOUS EMAILS TO GM /CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLINE, TALKED TO WAYNE IN THE  SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND BILLY BOYLE IN THE BODY SHOP AT PRIORITY CHEVY.

THE FLOOR BOARD HAD BEEN WET IN THE PAST, BUT NEVER TO THIS EXTENT. WE HAD SEVERAL DAYS OF RAINFALL THAT ACCUMULATED OVER 10\". AS OF MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2ND, MY VEHICLE WAS DIAGNOSED BY A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AS FOLLOWS; A SEAM UNDER THE LUGGAGE RACK THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY WELDED AND IS ALLOWING ANY WATER TO LEAK IN TO THE D PILLAR OF MY VEHICLE AND IS COLLECTING IN BOTTOM OF THE FLOOR BOARDS AND SURFACING THROUGH THE CARPET. THIS IS NOT A 'WEAR AND TEAR' SITUATION; THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE DURING THE MANUFACTURING OF THIS VEHICLE. MY CHILDREN AND I HAVE BEEN BREATHING IN BLACK MOLD AND MILDEW DUE TO THIS DEFECT OVER SEVERAL MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. THE SEAM NEEDS TO BE WELDED PROPERLY AND THE CARPET NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED. THERE IS BLACK MOLD VISIBLE. THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND MEANS FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR ME AND MY CHILDREN. I DRIVE THIS VEHICLE EVERY DAY TO AND FROM WORK. I EXPERIENCE HEAD ACHES EVERY SINGLE DAY AND FEAR THAT BEING IN THE SMALL AREA OF MY VEHICLE WITH ALL OF THIS BLACK MOLD IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE. GENERAL MOTORS IS REFUSING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE MY VEHICLE IS A 2005 AND NOT UNDER WARRANTY. THIS IS NOT WEAR AND TEAR, THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM FROM THE DAY THE CAR WAS MANUFACTURED. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE FROM EQUINOX OWNERS FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM, SATURATED FLOOR BOARDS AND SEVERAL INCHES OF STANDING WATER IN THE SPARE TIRE COMPARTMENT.

I WAS TOLD THAT CHEVROLET USES DEX-COOL ORANGE COOLANT IN THIS VEHICLE AND IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  IT HAS ONLY BEEN NOW,MONTHS LATER, THAT I HAVE LEARNED GM AGREED TO SETTLE A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT TIED TO THE ENGINE COOLANT IN VEHICLES BEGINNING IN 1995.

I WAS NOT FORTUNATE TO BELONG WITHIN THIS GROUP OF CARS WHO COULD BE COMPENSATED, AND MISSED THE FILING DEADLINE OF OCTOBER 27, 2008.  HOWEVER, I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT GM CONTINUED TO USE THIS COOLANT IN A BRAND NEW MODEL IN 2005 KNOWING THERE HAD BEEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR THE SAME TYPE ENGINE FOR YEARS OF USING IT.

I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS TO BE FIXED BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON INTERNET FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAME ISSUE WITH THIS TYPE OF CAR.  I AM NOT TAKING IT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PAY HUNDREDS OR POSSIBLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. I WILL TAKE IT TO A LOCAL REPUTABLE MECHANIC WHO IS VERY TRUSTWORTHY AND REASONABLE. *TR",

HAVE HEARD THAT THE TIERODS ARE TO BLAME, HAVE MENTIONED IT, BUT STILL DEAL WITH THIS RATTLE THAT GOES UNACCOUNTED.  ALSO HAVE BAD ELECTRICAL THAT \"CAN'T BE REPLICATED\" AT THE DEALERSHIP.  RADIO AND PANEL IN DASH FLASH AT RANDOM TIMES AS IF A WIRE WERE LOOSE OR SHORTING, LOUD BOOMING THUDS COME FROM THE SPEAKERS AT THE SAME TIME.  SPEAKER BLEW IN DOOR, BUT AFTER WARRANTY.  REGARDLESS OF NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE THESE THINGS WHEN TAKEN IN TO GET LOOKED AT.  FUEL GAGE STICKS, BUT EITHER HAVE TO PAY 120.00 TO POSSIBLY CORRECT IT WITH A FUEL SYSTEM CLEANER, OR PAY 700.00 TO REPLACE FUEL FILTER.  SUCH GREAT OPTIONS.

EACH TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS AND EACH TIME A REPAIR WAS MADE.  ONLY AFTER THE WARRANTY WAS OUT DID I DISCOVER BY ACCIDENT THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE CAUSED BY A FAULTY WIRING HARNESS.  THE MAIN DASH WIRING HARNESS LOCATED IN THE LEFT FLOOR PANEL ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAS SIGNS OF MELTING, AND SHORTS WITH THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT.  THE SHORTAGE CAUSES THE AIR CONDITIONER TO STOP BLOWING AND WILL CAUSE THE ENGINE TO COMPLETELY DIE OUT.  I HAVE HAD THE CAR EVALUATED BY TWO MECHANICS WHO BOTH STATED, WITHOUT KNOWING SOMEONE ELSE HAD LOOKED AT IT, THAT THE CAR IS A FIRE HAZARD AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY.  I ALSO SPOKE WITH A LOCAL BODY SHOP THAT HAS REPAIRED AT LEAST ONE EQUINOX THAT BURNED DUE TO THIS SAME WIRING HARNESS.  THE REPAIRS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE AT A COST OF $4,000.00.

IT FELT AND SOUNDED LIKE THE CAR WAS GOING TO BREAK IN TWO.  WE BROUGHT IT BACK TO OUR MECHANIC.  THIS TIME IT WAS THE SUSPENSION SYSTEM AGAIN.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS CALLED.  THERE IS A ROD THAT IS FROM THE TOP OF THE STRUT THAT GOES DOWN TO THE WHEEL.  THESE BOTH NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THE VEHICLE IS AT THE SHOP NOW.  THANK FULLY THESES RODS ONLY COST $30 A PIECE.

ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL, I WAS APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT AND BEGAN APPLYING THE BRAKES BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP. IT MADE A VIBRATING NOISE AND THRUST ITSELF FORWARD.  IT WASN'T A GRINDING SOUND BUT CLICKS AND VIBRATION.  LUCKILY THERE WASN'T ANYONE IN FRONT OF ME OR COMING FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  I THOUGHT IT SOMETHING I DID AND CONTINUED DRIVING CAREFULLY.  AT THE NEXT STOP I WAS UNABLE TO SLOW DOWN TO MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN. I PASSED THE TURN COMPLETELY BEFORE THE CAR SLOWED ENOUGH TO TURN.  THIS SCARED ME SO I PULLED OVER AND CALLED FOR HELP. AFTER TAKING A TEST DRIVE WITH A CAR REPAIR PERSON WHO INFORMED ME IT WASN'T MY BRAKE PADS OR ROTORS.  HE SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE MY ANTI-LOCK SYSTEM FAILING AND I SHOULD CALL THE DEALERSHIP.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID TO BRING IT IN.  GM ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TOWED IT. THAT WAS SATURDAY AND TODAY IS  MONDAY, THE DEALERSHIP WORKER TOLD ME SHE DROVE IT AND SHE HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR 12 YEARS AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES BUT THEY WILL PUT IT ON THE ELECTRIC DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE TO DOUBLE CHECK IT.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE WITH MY CHILDREN.  THE FACT THAT THE CAR MAY NOT STOP OR THE BRAKES MAY FAIL AT ANY TIME IS SCARY.  I SHOULD HEAR FROM THEM BY THIS EVENING. *JB",
