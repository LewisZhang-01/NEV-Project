AS SOON AS I TURN OFF THE CAR AND TURN IT ON THE CAR WOULD RUN NORMAL AGAIN. WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY IT WILL GO OFF ON LIMP MODE INTO THE NEUTRAL WITHOUT WARNING. RIGHT AFTER THAT THE CAR WOULD START HAVING STARTING UP PROBLEMS SO I HAD TO PAY MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET TO HAVE THE ECU REPLACED AND THE FUEL REGULATOR REPLACED AS WELL. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 I STARTED HAVING NEW PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM. SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT LIMP MODE HAS AFFECTED MY WHOLE CAR AND IT HAS TO BE FIXED. THE CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE BUT IT IS MY ONLY FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. I TOOK IT TO AUDI DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE LIMP MODE WAS RELATED TO THE TRIPTRONIC MODULE THAT WAS LOCATED INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION AND IT WAS A $5,000 FIX. I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT PUTTING THE CAR INTO SPORT MODE WOULD MAKE IT LESS LIKELY TO GET ITSELF INTO LIMP MODE THAN DRIVING THE CAR NORMALLY BUT EVEN THOUGH DRIVING THE CAR INTO SPORT MODE WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THE CAR WILL STILL GET ITSELF INTO LIMP MODE MAKING THE CAR UNSAFE TO PULL OVER THE CAR.
