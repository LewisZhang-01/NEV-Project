IT WAS A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THE ACD PUMP WHERE THE SEAL SHRINKS DURING WINTER ALLOWING DEBRIS TO ENTER THE ACD PUMP SYSTEM.  DURING THE SUMMER, THE SEAL EXPAND TRAPPING THE DEBRIS WITHIN CAUSING REGULAR FAILURE OF THE PUMP EVERY 30,000 TO 40,000 MILES.  CONSIDERING THEY'VE USED THE PUMP SINCE 2005, MITSUBISHI SHOULD KNOW FULL WELL THE ACD PUMP IS NO GOOD AND SHOULD'VE REDESIGNED IT A LONG TIME AGO.  *TR",
