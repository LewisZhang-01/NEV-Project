The contact stated that while entering the front passenger side of the vehicle and using the passenger side hand grip, the hand grip fractured. Due to the failure, the contact fell backwards out of the vehicle and landed on her head and back. With the assistance of another pedestrian and her husband, the contact was taken to the hospital where a cat scan revealed internal bleeding around her head; the contact was able to be released the same day. Since the accident, the contact has had soreness and pain to both hands, back, neck and hip. The contact called the dealer where she was informed that the hand grips were not used for assistance into the vehicle but only for going over bumps in the road. The contact stated that she then read the owners manual and none of that information was listed. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 92,000.",

WHAT IS THE RATIONALE OF SUCH A BARRIER? IT CAUSES MORE TRAFFIC AS IT PREVENTS THE HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLES TO ENTER HOV LANE AND ADDS MORE CARS TO BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC. IT DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM CAR POOLING SINCE REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HOV LANES. I THINK THE HOV LANE SHOULD BE FREE TO ENTER FROM ANYWHERE FOR HOV'S (AS IN MOST STATES, SUCH AS FLORIDA).
