I HAD TO PULL OVER ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY I WAS DRIVING ON, WHERE IT WAS NOTICED I HAD OIL LEAKING UNDERNEATH OF MY CAR AND THAT OIL SPRAYED ALL OVER THE BACK OF MY CAR.      THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I TOOK MY VEHICLE HAD TO TEAR DOWN MY ENGINE TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE OF THE BREAKDOWN.  WATER GOT INTO THE PCV VALVE AND FROZE INSIDE OF IT (IT WAS 3 DEGREES THAT MORNING WHEN THIS OCCURRED).  THE ICE CAUSED A BLOCKAGE OF AIR WHICH CAUSED MY REAR MAIN SEAL TO LEAK OIL TO A LOW LEVEL THAT DAMAGED MY ENGINE. WHILE THE OIL WAS PUMPING OUT, IT BROKE A ROD,A PISTON, SCARRED UP CRANK BEARINGS, WIPED OUT THE TIMING CHAIN, AMONG OTHER ENGINE PARTS.     I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE, WHICH DID NOT COVER THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR.
