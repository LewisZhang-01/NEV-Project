UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT MANY OTHER SUBARU OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. IT TURNS OUT TO BE A FAULTY CLAMP AND/OR HOSE, WHICH RESULTS IN LEAKING GASOLINE OUT OF THE FUEL LINE.  THIS CONCERNS ME FOR NUMEROUS REASONS, BUT THE MAIN REASON IS THAT IT IS LEAKING GASOLINE IN THE ENGINE BAY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A FIRE AND ULTIMATELY INJURY/DEATH.  THE SMELL IT PRODUCES IN THE CABIN IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS ME, ESPECIALLY IF CHILDREN ARE IN THE CAR.  THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE VERY COLD, PROBABLY BELOW 20 OR 25 DEGREES F.

I AM IN THE PROCESS OF SUBMITTING THIS FOR A WARRANTY CLAIM, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS THAT IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE DENIED.  SUBARU OF AMERICA IS NOTORIOUS FOR DENYING CLAIMS ON ALL STIS ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE ABUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE TRUTH OF THIS ACCUSATION.  I AM RATHER UPSET ABOUT THIS, AS I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE CAR WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SUBARU WOULD HONOR THEIR WARRANTY - ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN ABUSED OR MODIFIED (OTHER THAN A REMOVAL OF THE LARGE, UNATTRACTIVE WING, A COSMETIC MODIFICATION ONLY).      THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THESE SAME PROBLEMS, BOTH WITH THE FAILURE OF 5TH GEAR IN THEIR 2004 OR 2005 STI AND WITH SUBARU DENYING THEIR CLAIM AND CHARGING THEM HUGE FEES FOR DISASSEMBLING AND INSPECTING THE ENGINE.  I CAN PROVIDE A LINK TO THE ONLINE RECORD (ON A SUBARU ENTHUSIAST WEBSITE), AS WELL AS CONTACT INFO FOR OTHER OWNERS AFFECTED.    MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT SUBARU OBVIOUSLY KNOWS THAT THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THE 5TH GEAR SYNCHRO, EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD TO UPGRADE THE SYNCHRO IN 2006+ MODELS, AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL OR SOME SORT OF WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR CURRENT SUBARU STI OWNERS.  *TR",

IT WAS THEN I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS DUE TO ALLEGED ABUSE. THE PROOF OF THIS WAS THE PRESENCE OF CLUB STICKERS AND AFTERMARKET PARTS WHICH HAD  NO BEARING ON THE DEFECTIVE PARTS. THEY STATED THE PRESENCE OF THESE THINGS IMPLIED ABUSE TO THE CAR. THEY REFUSED  TO FIX IT UNLESS I PAYED.  THEY OFFERED NOTHING , BUT A 800 NUMBER TO COMPLAIN TO SUBARU OF AMERICA.
