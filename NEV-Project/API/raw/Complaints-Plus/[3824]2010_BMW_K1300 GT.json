WHILE RIDING THE BIKES THE ENGINE WOULD DIE WITHOUT ANY REASON. HIS DIED TWO TIMES AND MINE DIED FIVE TIMES, UNRELATED TO ANY SPECIFIC GEAR, OR RIDING CONDITION, ACCELERATION OR DECELERATION.   AFTER RETURNING FROM THE TRIP WE TOOK OUR BIKES TO THE BMW DEALER FOR SERVICE....EXPLAINED THE TROUBLE...THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT THERE WAS A BMW RECALL TO FIX THE PROBLEM...BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE EVERYTHING HE NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF IT.....PROBABLY WOULD BE TWO WEEKS.....I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT BMW IS SELLING BRAND NEW MOTORCYCLES THAT THEY KNOW ARE DEFECTIVE AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.....CAN YOU IMAGINE RIDING A MOTORCYCLE AT 70 MILES PER HOUR AND THE ENGINE JUST STOPS WITHOUT ANY WARNING AND FOR NO REASON.....THE BMW DEALERSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL THE BIKES UNTIL THEY ARE FIXED...... *TR",
