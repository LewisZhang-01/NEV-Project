IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THIS DRAIN PIPE DIRECTS WATER RIGHT ONTO THE SUB FRAME IN THIS SECTION, WHICH WOULD CAUSE IT TO RUST OUT FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE FRAME. MY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS IS AS FOLLOWS:    1) THERE ARE 316,000+ MILES REGISTERED ON THE ODOMETER AND THE VEHICLE WAS NOT GARAGE KEPT. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT SURFACES EXPOSED TO ROAD DEBRIS, SALT, AND WATER SHOULD BE EQUALLY AS RUSTED.  2) THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE SUBFRAME IS COMPLETELY INTACT.  3) THE AFFECTED PORTION OF THE SUBFRAME IS ACTUALLY THE SUPERIOR (TOP) ASPECT WHICH IS DIRECTLY BELOW THE DRAIN PIPE, AS OPPOSED TO THE INFERIOR (BOTTOM) ASPECT, WHICH IS CLOSER TO THE ROAD.    JUST 2 MONTHS BEFORE I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THIS INDEPENDENT SHOP FOR CV SHAFT SERVICE, I HAD A HONDA DEALERSHIP, SPECIFICALLY CLASSIC HONDA LOCATED IN STREETSBORO, OHIO PERFORM A FRONT SWAY BAR BUSHING SERVICE AND I RECEIVED A COMPLEMENTARY INSPECTION. FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE SWAY BAR BUSHING LOCATION, THE BUSHINGS ARE HELD AGAINST THE FRONT SUBFRAME REAR CROSSMEMBER VIA BRACKETS THAT BOLT IN. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE HONDA TECHNICIAN WHO SERVICED MY VEHICLE LOOKED AT THE DAMAGED SUBFRAME. NOT ONLY DID THEY FAIL TO DETECT THIS ISSUE DURING THE SERVICE, THEY ALSO FAILED TO DETECT THIS ISSUE DURING THE INSPECTION FOR WHICH I SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT THEY LOOK AT THE STEERING AND SUSPENSION TO ASSESS SAFETY.

AFTER A FEW OF THESE SCARY EXPERIENCES, TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP IN ATLANTA GA.   COST OF $160 (DESCRIPTION -  ROUTINE MAINTENANCE - BG FUEL SERVICE ALL - CLEANED THROTTLE BODY).

THIS CASE IS ONE OF THEM.    MY HONDA - [XXX]  IS FACING ALL ISSUES SIMILAR TO ONES RECALLED FROM 1999-02 MODELS.    FIRST THE IGNITION SWITCH ISSUES LAST YEAR AND NOW THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY SAID  ITS NOT PART OF RE-CALL WHILE EVERYONE KNOWS THESE WERE PART OF RE-CALLS SO WHY WAS THIS VEHICLE DROPPED FROM THE RECALL DATABASE ?  HOW MANY MORE VEHICLES WERE DROPPED FROM THE LIST AND WHY ? I THINK THE ISSUE IS NOT RELATED TO AGE BUT SOMETHING ELSE AND NEEDS INVESTIGATION.    NOW IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW MANY VEHICLES THEY INCLUDE AND WHAT THEY DROP FROM RE-CALLS AS COST SAVING MEASURE ?

THE SUB-FRAME COMPONENT IS RUSTED THROUGH ON THE TOP SIDE, LEAVING ONLY THE LOWER PORTION OF IT HOLDING THE ENGINE AND SUSPENSION IN PLACE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL DEALERS SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY SAID THAT THIS IS A DEFINITE SAFETY ISSUE, AND THE SUB-FRAME COMPONENT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THE PART IS CALLED THE \"REAR BEAM\" (PART NUMBER 50200-S84-A00).  TOTAL COST OF REPAIR ESTIMATE WAS ORIGINALLY $1400, BUT DEALER QUOTED $1100 DUE TO THE UNCOMMON OF THE REPAIR AND ITS SEVERITY IF THE PART WERE TO FAIL WHILE DRIVING.  THE DEALER HAS RECENTLY SEEN ANOTHER VEHICLE OF THE SAME AGE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.    I SPOKE WITH ANOTHER LOCAL DEALERS SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY ALSO SAID THAT THIS TYPICALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DONE ON THE VEHICLE.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME TO CONTACT THE AMERICAN HONDA SERVICE CENTER TO SEE IF THEY WOULD AT ALL ASSIST IN THIS SERVICE ISSUE.  MY REQUEST WAS ESCALATED TO WALTER, THE EXECUTIVE TEAM MANAGER, AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE WHATSOEVER.  I PLAN ON GETTING THIS COMPONENT REPLACED BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT MY ENGINE AND SUSPENSION TO BECOME DETACHED FROM MY VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING, BUT FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SERVICE AS THE CAR IS 9 YEARS, 6 MONTHS OLD SINCE MANUFACTURED.  THE VEHICLE SUB-FRAME SHOULD NOT RUST THROUGH. *TR",

I CONTACTED THEM ABOUT MY DISCOVERY, AND THEY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A DIAGNOSTIC (WHICH WAS INDICATED TO ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR) TO DETERMINE IF THE PART TRULY NEEDED REPLACING. THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE PART. THEY STATED THE PART HAD BEEN REPLACED ONLY 1/2 WAY THROUGH MY STRUGGLE TO GET THEM TO REPLACE IT. I WAS TOLD BY H CORP. THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED. HONDA.COM INDICATED THAT IT NEEDED REPLACING, AND THEN MIRACULOUSLY MID-WAYS THROUGH MY BATTLE WITH GSH IT SHOWS UP IN THE COMPUTER AS HAVING BEEN REPLACED. I HAVE HAD THE CAR SINCE BEFORE THE RECALL. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED. I DO WONDER HOW MANY OTHER WOMEN AND UNSUSPECTING MEN THEY HAVE GOUGED IN THE POCKET TO RANDOMLY REPLACE GOOD PARTS ($1000 - $2000 FOR ME). MY CAR FINALLY BROKE DOWN (WOULDN'T CRANK); I WAS W/OUT A VEHICLE FOR 1 WEEK; ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD IT TOWED TO HER CAR DEALER. HE RAN A DIAGNOSTIC WHICH INDICATED THE RECALL PART NEEDED REPLACING, DAH. HE REPLACED THE RECALL PART.

THEY LIKE TO SCREW YOU ONCE YOU DRIVE UP AND TELL YOU LOTS OF THINGS YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO TO YOUR CAR JUST TO TAKE EVERY DIME YOU HAVE TO YOUR NAME.  I ONCE SAW A HONDA OUTSIDE THE SHOWROOM WHERE I BOUGHT MY CAR,, IT WAS ON SHOWCASE FOR ITS MILEAGE OF OVER 600,000 MILES!  IM THINKING THEY DIDN'T HAVE TRANNY PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY REACHED 200,000 MILES!  *TR",

FIRST TIME WAS ON I40 GOING APP 75.  I WAS IN THE OUTER FREAKING LANE AND IT JUST TURNED OFF.  I LIVED WITH THIS VERY FREAKING HAZARDOUS PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T TRUST HONDA AND MONEY (JUST NOTE ONE OF THE PHONE CALLS FROM HONDA THE MAN TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT WAS MY IGNITION SWITCH AGAIN AND THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF REPAIR THIS FREAKING TIME BUT LATER DECIDED IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE,!)I WAS IN COLLEGE TAKING MY EMT PRACTICALS WITH AN EMS SYSTEM AND WAS HAVING TO DRIVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY AND BE IN CONTACT VIA CELL PHONE WITH HONDA, AND BORROW MY DADS TRUCK!!  THEY HAD MY CAR FOR DAYS AND KEEP CALLING AND ASKING IF ONE OF THERE MECHANICS COULD DRIVE MY CAR TO LUNCH ,, AND IF THEY COULD TAKE IT HOME OVER NIGHT AND SO ON, AND FINALLY SAID IT WOULDN'T STALL FOR THEM!!!!!  I WAS '!@#$%! THEY DID ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF 75$ AND MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WASN'T EVEN ON! THEY ALSO SAID I NEEDED NEW SPARK PLUGS, I HAD NEW SPARK PLUGS AND IM NOT AN IDIOT,, THERE WAS NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ?!@#$% THINGS.  THEY ALSO EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT I NEEDED MY FUEL SYSTEM CLEANED, BECAUSE THEY REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID THEMSELVES!  THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULDN'T CHARGE ME FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE IF I GOT THE 120$ NEW SPARK PLUGS, MINE WERE NEW AND WORKING VERY WELL.  SO OF COURSE I HAD NO OPTION.  AFTER READING S FEW COMPLAINTS HERE AND ON OTHER SITES, I AM SEEING THAT THEY TOTALLY TOOK ME FOR OVER 500$ AND THAT MY PROBLEM WAS IN MY IGNITION SWITCH,, IM WONDERING IF THEY SNUCK AND REPLACED IT AGAIN BEHIND MY BACK JUST TO CHARGE ME FOR OTHER '!@#$% THEY DIDN'T DO.

AND IT MAKES A CLUNK SOUND AND THE WHOLE CAR SHAKES WHEN THE GEAR IS SHIFTED TO REVERSE OR DRIVE. I CALLED THE MARIN HONDA SERVICE ADVISOR AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM MUST BE RELATED TO THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACEMENT, BUT HE WAS ADAMANT THAT IGNITION SWITCH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRANSMISSION.  HE SAID IT IS PURE COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH THE IGNITION AND TRANSMISSION HAD PROBLEMS AT THE SAME TIME.  NOVEMBER 28,2006  DECEMBER 1, 2006  THE MECHANIC AT PETALUMA HONDA SAID THAT THE RANGE SENSOR IS MALFUNCTIONING AND THERE ARE A FEW WIRES DANGLING WHICH MAY BE WHY THE CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT WORKING.

DECEMBER 2, 2006 EDDIE PARNELL, SERVICE MANAGER AT MARIN HONDA SAID THAT THEY'VE REPLACED THE RANGE SENSOR BUT STILL HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. HE THOUGHT IT COULD BE THE TRANSMISSION.

WHEN I COMPLAINED THAT 3 1/2 YEARS WAS AN UNUSUALLY SHORT LIFE FOR AN IGNITION SWITCH, ESPECIALLY AFTER A RECALL, I WAS GIVEN THE HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER TO CALL AND COMPLAIN.  UPON CALLING, I WAS AGAIN TOLD THAT HONDA HAS NO OBLIGATION TO DO ANYTHING.  I CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN.  FINALLY, THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD FILE A CASE FOR INDIVIDUAL REVIEW.  TODAY, I RECEIVED THE DECISION THAT MY CASE DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A \"GOODWILL CASE\" BECAUSE MY CAR DOES NOT RECEIVE ITS MAINTENANCE AT THE DEALER.   (WHY SHOULD I WHEN I CAN GET THE SAME WORK DONE FOR 1/3 TO 2/3 OF WHAT THE DEALER CHARGES.)   I TOLD THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP, CHRIS, THAT APPARENTLY THE SWITCHES HONDA FURNISHED THE DEALERS FOR THE RECALL PARTS WERE AS DEFECTIVE AS THE ORIGINAL AND HONDA DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS OR FOR POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THEM.  HE DID NOT DISAGREE, BUT MAINTAINED HIS STANCE THAT THEY HAD NO OBLIGATION SINCE THEY FIXED IT ONCE AND I DON'T HAVE MY CAR REPAIRED AT THE DEALER.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW POLICY FOR \"GOODWILL\" CASES CAN SUPERSEDE SAFETY ISSUES.    I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT HONDA SHOULD PAY FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE SWITCH.  THEY ARE FLAT DENYING ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PROBLEM THAT CAN AND PROBABLY ALREADY HAS RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY.  *JB",

I TOOK MY CAR TO ANOTHER FACILITY - ONE THAT FIXES AND MAINTAINS RACE CARS - THEY INDICATED THAT AUTO MAKERS ARE USING LIGHTER (AND LESS DURABLE) PARTS TO ENHANCE MPG RATINGS - WHICH IS MORE LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH MY HONDA ACCORD, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES.  THE GOOD NEWS WAS THAT WHILE MY CAR WAS IN, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE RECALL ON THE IGNITION SWITCH FIXED, AND AT THE SAME TIME, THEY INDICATED THAT MY CAR NEEDS A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER - I BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE MANY HONDA OWNERS ARE FACING - \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT COMES ON ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS INTO EACH NEW GAS CAP.  I'VE HAD 4 FOR THIS VEHICLE (AND HAVE NOT LOST ANY).  I'VE NEVER REPLACED A GAS CAP IN MY LIFE BEFORE, JUST AS I HAVE NEVER HAD BRAKE ROTOR PROBLEMS BEFORE.  THE ONLY GOOD THING I COULD SAY WAS THAT THEY DID NOT CHARGE ME THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE - GIVEN THE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD, I WOULD HOPE NOT.  I ENDED UP HAVING THE O2 FILTER / SENSOR (WHATEVER IT IS) REPLACED AT ANOTHER FACILITY - WHICH TOOK CARE OF A DROP IN MILEAGE ISSUE I WAS EXPERIENCING. THE BAD NEWS FOR HONDA IS THAT I AM PROBABLY GOING BACK TO TOYOTA - I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ANOTHER HONDA IF THE DEALERSHIP WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES OR MAKE ME AN OFFER I CAN'T REFUSE (WITH A DECENT TRADE IN ON THIS VEHICLE)...I'M IN THE MARKET FOR A 2004-2005 SMALL TO MED SUV...I LOVED SOME ASPECTS OF MY ACCORD, BUT NEED A NEW, LARGER VEHICLE TO HAUL MY DAUGHTER BACK AND FORTH TO COLLEGE.

THEY DID NOT TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS NOR DID THEY OFFER TO REPAIR THIS AT A CHARGE.  WHEN I PURCHASED MY CAR I BOUGHT THE 100,000 MILE EXTENDED WARRANTY, WHICH I PAID CLOSE TO $1500 FOR.

THE TIRES ARE NOW BALD AND STRINGS ARE FLYING OFF THEM. WHEN SHE TOOK THE CAR BACK TO TIRES PLUS THEY SAOID THAT THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE ON THOSE TIRES. THEY SAID THEY HAD NO MILEAGE WARRANTY. THE SALESMAN TOLD HER THAT THEY GAVE HER A BREAK ON HER ALIGNEMENT. SHE SAID SHE NEVER ASKED FOR A BREAK AND HAD NO IDEA THEY GAVE HER ONE AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE DEFECTED ( ALL FOUR) TIRES. THEY TOLD HER THE AIR PRESSURE WAS 31 POUNDS AND SHOULD BE 35 LBS. SHE TOLD THEM SHE PUMPS THEM DAILY AND THEY DON'T HOLD THE AIR. THEY TOLD HER THATS' TOUGH AND THEY WOULD SELL HER 4 NEW TIRES FOR JUST OVER THEIR COST. NOW MY 21 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS DRIVING ON BALD FRAYING TIRES. SHE WORKS TWO JOBS AND IS AT THE NIGHT JOB NOW. I AM AFRAID THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO . NEITHER I ( HER MOTHER) NOR SHE CAN PAY FOR NEW TIRES AT THE MOMENT. IF I COULD I WOULD AND MAYBE NEXT MONTH I WILL BUT I DON'T WANT HER TO DRIVE WITH THOSE TIRES ENDANGER HER OR OTHERS. SHE MUST WORK BUT FOR VERY EXPENSIVE TIRES TO BE TOTALLY SHOT AFTER 4 MONTHS IS UNACCEPTABLE. WHAT SHOULD WE DO. SHE HAD HAD THE TIRES ROTATED AND THE CAR SERVICED BY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP. *AK",

I'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS FILED WITH REGARD TO THIS VEHICLE, AND CONCUR WITH OTHERS THAT THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR WARPED ROTORS AT THIS POINT.  FRONT AND BACK BRAKES WERE REPLACED LAST YEAR (ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS), BRAKES HAVE BEEN INSPECTED ROUTINELY, AND I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING ROUTINELY IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC, NOR DO I TAKE MY CAR TO CAR WASHES WHEN IT IS BITTER COLD OUTSIDE (AS THE HONDA REP INDICATED COULD BE THE CAUSE).  IN ADDITION TO PAYING FOR PM SERVICE AT HONDA, I NOW HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $138+ FOR ROTOR REPAIRS.  MY DRIVE TO WORK IS PRETTY EASY, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO YEARS WHEN I DROVE TO DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS DAILY.  IF I WAS EVER GOING TO HAVE \"ROTOR WARP\" ISSUES, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE VEHICLES THAT DROVE THE CITY MILES.  THEREFORE, IT WAS A SURPRISE TO BE HIT WITH \"WARPED ROTORS.\"  I WAS ALREADY A HONDA OWNER A WHEN I HEARD ABOUT HOW \"SECRETIVE\" THEY ARE WITH THEIR QUALITY ISSUES.  WHY DO THEY FEEL THE NEED TO HIDE THEIR PARTS, SERVICE, AND DESIGN FLAWS, AND TRY TO EVADE CUSTOMER CARE OPPORTUNITIES?  HONDA SHOULD BE UPFRONT AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE VEHICLES THEY MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, AND PROFIT FROM IN THIS COUNTRY.  AFTER ALL, THESE WERE \u001cGENUINE HONDA PARTS\u001d THAT WARPED.  I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER THIS COMPLAINT AND HOPE THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS PART OR DESIGN FAILURE YIELDS SOME GOOD NEWS IN RECOUPING SOME OF THE COST.  HAVING MADE MY LAST CAR PAYMENT YESTERDAY, I WAS HOPING TO HAVE A BREAK FROM PAYMENTS AND REPAIRS FOR A WHILE.  HOWEVER, THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE A REPEAT PROBLEM, AND IF SO, I MAY NEED TO LOOK AT NEW VEHICLES.  A LOT DEPENDS ON WHAT HONDA DOES, OR DOES NOT DO, TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.   *NLM",

WILDE HONDA ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE AIR INTAKE FILTER BEING CHANGED AND THE TIRES BEING WORN. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ,THATIS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER CASES LIKE THIS. THANK YOU. *AK",

TOLD THEM ABOUT THE 'CHECK ENGINE' LIGHT. THE DEALER FOUND CODE 1146.  THE DEALER RESET THE CODE AS REQUIRED THEN WARMED UP THE CAR AND ROAD TEST WITH WIDE OPEN THROTTLE AND RELEASE/NO CODE RETURNED.  TECH INSPECTED PRIMARY OXYGEN SENSOR AND ALL WAS OKAY.  I GOT THE CAR BACK WITH INSTRUCTION THAT IF THE CODE APPEAR AGAIN THEY NEED TO ORDER THE PRIMARY OXYGEN SENSOR.  ON 10/07/1999 JUST SEVEN DAYS LATER I RECIEVED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. I CALLED THE DEALER AND GOT THE APPOINTMENT FOR 10/13/1999.  THE DEALER FOUND THE SAME CODE P1146, OXYGEN SENSOR FOUND FAULTY AND REPLACED IT.  I GOT THE SAME INSTRUCTION, IF THE LIGHT COMES BACK AGAIN PLEASE BRING IT BACK.  I GOT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AGAIN ON 12/22/1999.  WE WENT OUT FOR CHRISTMAS WEEKEND.  CALLED THE DEALER ON 12/28/1999 AND GOT THE APPOINTMENT FOR 01/04/2000.  THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME THE CAR WENT BACK TO THE DEALER.  THE DEALER FOUND THE SAME CODE AND TOLD ME THAT IT IS NOT WORTH REPLACING THE OXYGEN SENSOR BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CARS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEM AND THE HONDA TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT IS LOOKING INTO THE PROBLEM.  THEY DID NOT CLOSE THE INVOICE BUT RETURNED MY CAR SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR EXCEPT ONE YELLOW LIGHT WITH \"CHECK ENGINE\" ON IT.  IN MARCH OF 2000, I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SAYING THEY ARE STILL LOOKING INTO THE PROBLEM WITH NO SOLUTIONS TO THIS DATE.THEY WILL CONTACT ME LATER.  I BELIEVE IF AN AUTOMOBILE IS DRIVEN WITH 'CHECK ENGINE' LIGHT IT COULD BE DEANGEROUS IF SOMETHING REALLY GOES WRONG.  IS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE?  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.
