ONLY \"INSPECTED.\"    THE TECH WAS TOLD OF DETAILED POOR PERFORMANCE AND SYMPTOMS OF A BAD PCM. SUCH AS SHIFTING, STALLING, FUEL ECONOMY & HARD TO START. THE JEEP IS NOT OPERATING OPTIMALLY & THIS COULD MEAN THERE ARE. OTHER PROBLEMS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.    ALL OF THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF A FAULTY PCM. AS WELL AS THE ABS LIGHT BEING ON THE DASHBOARD.    THE PCM IS A \"CRITICAL\" SYSTEM & NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I'M REQUESTING THAT YOU FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR FREE, AS IT IS DEFECTIVE AND COULD MINGLE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS AND CAUSE A COMPLETE VEHICLE BREAK DOWN. OR REFUND THE COST TO ME IN FULL, INCLUDING LABOR CHARGES, IF I REPLACE/REPAIR MYSELF.     IF THIS DEFECTIVE PART IS NOT FIXED, IT COULD RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE, IN WHICH CDJ WOULD BE LIABLE FOR.

THE VEHICLE STALLS ON HIGHWAY, IN PARK, ON THE STREET, WHEN STOPPED AND THEN IT STALLS OUT AND IS HARD TO START. IT ALSO HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GO IN REVERSE ( BACK UP).

AS BACKGROUND, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A DEALER, MALL OF GEORGIA JEEP, FOR THE REPAIR (I.E., TO REPLACE TOWING HITCH) ON 8.12.2014 AND WAS TOLD THE NEXT DAY THAT I COULD NOT USE THE  HITCH THAT HAD BEEN REPLACED. THE MECHANIC HAD STRUGGLED (HE ADMITTED TO ME) TO DO THE JOB AND IT TOOK HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES THE ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE THE WORK. IN FACT, IT TOOK SO LONG THAT I HAD TO GO HOME IN A RENTAL CAR AND HAD TO RETURN THE FOLLOWING DAY TO PICK UP MY JEEP. WHEN I RETURNED ON 8.13.2014, I WAS TOLD  THAT I SHOULD NO LONGER USE THE HITCH FOR TOWING. I ASKED WHY AND WAS TOLD THAT  THIS WAS THE MANUFACTURER'S GUIDANCE; HOWEVER, I WAS NOT GIVEN ANYTHING, TO THIS EFFECT, IN WRITING. I HAVE TWO CONCERNS: 1) WAS THE SAFETY RECALL REPAIR DONE CORRECTLY GIVEN A) THE DIFFICULTY THAT THE MECHANIC HAD IN DOING THE JOB AND  B) THE DEALER NOT STANDING BEHIND THE FIAT CHRYSLER OEM REPLACEMENT HITCH THAT IT HAD INSTALLED; AND,  2) APPARENTLY THE DEALER REPLACED A FUNCTIONING HITCH WITH ONE THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT TELLING ME SO IN ADVANCE. I CONTACTED FIAT CHRYSLER (CASE # 25468706) ON 8.13.2014 AND ASKED FOR AUTHORIZATION TO TAKE MY JEEP TO ANOTHER AUTHORIZED  DEALER TO CHECK THE REPAIR WORKMANSHIP, I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS INSPECTION TO BE DONE. I BELIEVE THAT  MY CONCERNS ARE REASONABLE AND DO NOT THINK IT IS FAIR THAT I MUST BEAR THE COST OF A SAFETY INSPECTION. I AM ASKING YOUR AGENCY TO HELP ME  GET THIS  INSPECTION DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT PARTY, TO BE PAID FOR BY FIAT CHRYSLER, GIVEN THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ISSUES I HAVE RAISED.

THE LAST \"SHAKING\" INCINDENT HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING OVER AN OVER PASS ABOUT 45MPH, STARTED PRAYING BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE! SO, WANTING THE REPAIRS DONE PROPERLY I CALL A 1-800 JEEP CHRYSLER NUMBER TO ASK FOR A CERTIFIED MECHANIC. WHILE ON THE PHONE I HAD A FEELING TO ASK ABOUT RECALLS. I WAS INFORMED OF ONLY TWO (MINOR) ISSUES. CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE RECALL REPAIRS DONE AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE OTHER ISSUES. I DID NOT END UP WITH BOTH RECALLS DONE (THEY DID NOT FEEL THE CONVERTER NEEDED REPLACED)!!! I DECLINED THE PRICE OF THIER ESTIMATE NOT THE REPAIRS! THE ESTIMATE GIVEN ROUGHLY TOTALS $3,929.00!

FORTUNATELY, I GO TO THE SAME STATION AND THEY ARE USED TO ME DOING IT MYSELF. OTHERWISE THE ATTENDANT HAS TO BABYSIT THE NOZZLE AND PUMP IT IN SLOWER THAN THE SLOW SETTING.

ON INQUIRING IN A HANDFUL OF WEB SITES ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS PROBLEM I LEARNED THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF JEEP CHEROKEE OWNERS AND OWNERS OF OTHER JEEP MODELS IN A BROAD RANGE OF MANUFACTURE DATES BETWEEN '86 AND AS RECENT AS '05. ALSO LEARNED THAT THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\" OR \"DEATH SHAKE\". ADDITIONALLY, IN MY INTERNET RESEARCH, MANY JEEP OWNERS ATTEMPTING TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM HAVE TAKEN THEIR VEHICLES TO PROFESSIONAL MECHANICS INCLUDING CHRYSLER-JEEP DEALER/SERVICE CENTERS TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED, SPEND HUNDREDS, IN SOME CASES WELL OVER A THOUSAND $, ONLY TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLE RETURNED WITH NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE WOBBLE  CONDITION.       2. WITH OUR JEEP, THIS WOBBLE HAS NOT SUBSIDED. IT HAPPENS ON EVERY OCCASION WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAYS WHILE MERGING INTO TRAFFIC AS WE ACCELERATE UP TO THE 55 MPH RANGE. UPON ACCELERATION, AT APPROXIMATELY 51 TO 52 MPH A VIBRATION BEGINS, THEN UPON ACCELERATING AT 53 TO 55 MPH THE VIBRATION BECOMES A VIOLENT WOBBLE TO THE EXTREME THAT WE HAVE HAD INSTANCES WHEN WE HAD TO DECELERATE DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH OR LESS IN ORDER TO REGAIN CONTROL WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY. IF THERE IS A SAVING GRACE OUT OF THIS PROBLEM, IT IS THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE OUT OF THE WOBBLE BY GETTING BEYOND 55 MPH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,  BUT IN PHOENIX HIGHWAY DRIVING, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.  THOUGH' NOT IN EVERY INSTANCE AS DURING ACCELERATION, THE SAME CONDITION EXISTS @ 55 DURING DECELERATION AS WE EXIT THE HI-WAY.      3. THUS FAR, AS WE'VE READ AND HEARD OF SO MANY JEEP OWNERS SPENDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AT A PROF.

NOW TOLD BY MANAGER AT THE CHRYSLER SHOP THAT AN INTERNAL MEMO WAS ISSUED IN 1997 STATING THAT 1996 CHEROKEES HAD ALREADY STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM, INCLUDING FAULTY FUEL PUMP SYSTEMS AND CORRODED FUEL TANKS.  THEY SAID THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO OTHER THAN REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AT MY COST.  CHRYSLER IS HOLDING TRUE TO CHARACTER AND INSISTS THAT A JEEP WITH SO MANY MILES (IT'S A '96 WITH ONLY 58K MILES) WILL HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS.  THEY DO NOT SEEM TO THINK IT IS STRANGE THAT SUCH A MEMO WAS ISSUED DETAILING CORROSION IN THE TANKS OF A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF '96 JEEPS ONLY ONE YEAR AFTER MANUFACTURING DATE.  AM WORRIED ABOUT THE SMELL OF FUEL IN THE CAR AND SAFETY IN THE EVENT OF A SIDE IMPACT ACCIDENT.  DT",

AT THAT TIME IT DID BREAK THE TAILLIGHT ON THE JEEP, DENTED THE TAILGATE STRUCTURE, AND SCRAPED THE PAINT WHEN IT KNOCKED DOWN MY PUMP HOUSE. BASICALLY, THIS IS A DANGEOUS SITUATION! AS I SAID, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE MY ENGINE RUNNING WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS MATTER BE LOOKED INTO.

I COULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE AND OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED . THE SHAKING WAS SO VIOLENT THAT THE SEAMS ON THE RADIATOR WERE SPLIT AND I HAD TO BUY A NEW RADIATOR ALSO.  SINCE THE SHEAR FORCE WAS SO GREAT I AM LEFT WONDERING IF OTHER PARTS OF THE FRONT END AND CAR IN GENERAL ARE SOMEHOW DAMAGED OR WEAKENED. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER-DAMION CORP. AND THEY TOOK THE REPORT ON JULY 27TH. I HAVE MEDICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF TRYING TO CONTROL THE STEERING WHEEL AND BEING SHOOK BACK AND FORTH.  I HOPE THIS GETS ADDRESSED AS A RECAL ISSUE BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS A PROPLEM BUT HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!*AK",

MY VEHICLE WAS THE FIRST NORTHBOUND CAR TO STOP AT THE INTERSECTION.  I WAS WEARING MY SEAT BELT AND SHOULDER HARNESS WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE WHILE STOPPED HERE.  SEVERAL SECONDS LATER, AN INATTENTIVE DRIVER IN A PICKUP TRUCK COLLIDED INTO THE LEFT-REAR PORTION OF MY VEHICLE AT A WITNESS-ESTIMATED SPEED OF ABOUT 30 MPH.  FOLLOWING THE IMPACT, THE SHOULDER RESTRAINT SYSTEM DID NOT RESTRAIN MY UPPER BODY.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, MY HEAD HIT THE STEERING WHEEL WITH SUFFICENT FORCE TO CAUSE MULTIPLE HEAD AND NECK TRAUMA INCLUDING CONTUSIONS, LACERATIONS, MUSCLE STRAIN, A FRACTURED NASAL BONE AND SEPTUM, A SEVERE HEADACHE, LINGERING PAIN, AND DELAYED VERTIGO.  MY INJURIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SEVERE HAD I BEEN WEARING MY EYEGLASSES OR SUNGLASSES. THE JEEP WAS PROPELLED THROUGH THE CONTROLLED INTERSECTION AND EVENTUALLY CAME TO A STOP IN THE SOUTHBOUND LEFT-HAND TURN LANE; IT DID NOT COLLIDE WITH ANY OTHER OBJECTS.  I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS TO DAIMLER-CHRYSLER OFFICIALS ABOUT THE \"APPARENT\" FAILURE OF THE SHOULDER RESTRAINT SYSTEM TO PREVENT MY INJURIES AND THEY LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION.  THEIR FINDINGS WERE THAT \"THE SHOULDER RESTRAINT SYSTEM WAS NOT DESIGNED TO RESTRAIN THE DRIVER IN A REAR END COLLISION\".  IF THIS IS THE CASE AND IF THE SHOULDER RESTRAINT MECHANISM IN THIS JEEP IS THE CURRENT AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY STANDARD IN THE U.S., THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRING VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS TO: (1)DESIGN AN IMPROVED INDUSTRY-WIDE SHOULDER RESTAINT SYSTEM(S) TO BETTER PROTECT MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATORS AND PASSENGERS FROM SUSTAINING TRAUMATIC HEAD INJURIES IN REAR-END COLLISIONS; (2)INSTALL SUCH AN IMPROVED RESTRAINT SYSTEM IN ALL NEW AUTOS AND TRUCKS; AND (3)PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO INSTALL THESE IMPROVED RESTRAINTS IN VEHICLES MADE EARLIER.  *AK",

IT TOOK A NUMBER OF MONTHS TO DETERMINE THAT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE LEFT FRONT SWAY BAR LINK.  THE LINK HAS A BALL JOINT PROTECTED BY A RUBBER BOOT.

MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE MOTOR MOUNT LOOKED GOOD(ACTUALLY BRAND NEW), THOUGH THE BOLTS FOR THE RIGHT SIDE MOUNT BRACKET HAD SNAPPED OFF IN THE BLOCK. THE RIGHT SIDE MOTOR MOUNT BRACKET BOLTS SNAPPED OFF IN THE ENGINE BLOCK?  I WORKED FOR 5 YEARS AT VARIOUS DODGE DEALERSHIPS AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AND WORKING ON VEHICLES FOR 23+ YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE BOLTS FOR THE MOTOR MOUNT BRACKET SNAPPING OFF IN THE BLOCK.  I CALLED CHRYSLER (GUY MOLINA) AND INFORMED THEM OF THE PROBLEM, FILE # 5272069.  I ASKED IF THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM, CHRYSLER SAID NO.  ALTHOUGH VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY WOULD ASSIST IN THE COST OF THE REPAIRS AS LONG AS REGULAR MAINTENANCE ON THAT PART HAD BEEN DONE.  I CALLED THE JEEP DEALERS(6) IN THE PLAINFIELD NJ PHONE DIRECTORY.  I ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IF THEY HAD COME ACROSS THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  FIVE OF THE SIX SAID THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  I ASKED THE SERVICE PERSONNEL AT THE DEALERSHIP, IF I HAD BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE WOULD THEY HAVE CHECKED THESE BOLTS, THE ANSWER WAS NO, IT IS NOT A MAINTENENCE CHECK LIST ITEM.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS AS THE BOLTS MENTIONED SHOULD NOT FAIL.  THESE BOLTS ARE INSTALLED WITH LOCK TIGHT, THE ARE NOT MEANT TO FAIL OR BE REMOVED AND SHOULD LAST FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.  MY LAST CHRYSLER PRODUCT WAS A 1988 DODGE DAKOTA, I COULD HAVE MADE COMMERCIALS WITH WHERE I TOOK THAT VEHICLE AND NEVER BROKE A MOTOR MOUNT OR ANY OTHER PART ON THAT TRUCK.  WHEN I SOLD THAT TRUCK IT HAD 112,000+ MILES AND IT WAS STILL GOING STRONG.  THE JEEP IS DRIVEN BY MY WIFE, BACK AND FORTH TO WORK, WE ALSO USE THE JEEP TO TOW A POP-UP TRAILER.  IT HAS ONLY BEEN IN FOUR WHEEL(HIGH) IN SNOW OR HEAVY RAINS.  I CANNOT REMEMBER IF WE EVER HAD IT IN FOUR WHEEL(LOW).  THIS VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN MECHANICA",
