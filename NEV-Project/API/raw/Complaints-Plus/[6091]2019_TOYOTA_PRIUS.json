Upon taking the vehicle home, the contact inspected the vehicle himself and discovered corrosion on all four of the brake rotors. The contact took the vehicle back to the dealer where they confirmed the failure and informed him that there were no recalls on the vehicle and that the brake rotors were not covered under warranty. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and he filed a complaint. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 11,000.",
