MY FORD DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE RECALLED STRAP UNTIL THE FRAME WAS REPAIRED (AT MY EXPENSE).   FORD DOES NOT REPAIR THE FRAME UNDER THE RECALL, ONLY REPLACES THE STRAP. I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD DO THE FRAME REPAIR AS PART OF THE RECALL, AS THE STRAP WAS LESS RUSTY THAN THE FRAME. THE STRAPS, IN MY OPINION, WERE OF SIMILAR QUALITY AS THE FRAME, ONLY THINNER METAL.   MY TRUCK HAS BEEN VERY WELL MAINTAINED, BUT THE UNDERCARRIAGE HAS BEEN RUSTING EXCESSIVELY SINCE NEW. I OWN MUCH OLDER FORD VEHICLES WITH NO SUCH ISSUE; MY OPINION IS THAT FORD SOURCED POOR QUALITY MATERIALS WHEN BUILDING THESE MODEL YEAR TRUCKS.

MOST OF THE TIME I CAN LEAVE MY TRUCK PARKED, AND START IT UP THE NEXT DAY, SOMETIMES AFTER SITTING OVER NIGHT THE BATTERY IS MYSTERIOUSLY DRAINED DEAD THE NEXT MORNING. I HAVE BEEN DILIGENT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE LEFT NOTHING ON THAT COULD IN ANY WAY DRAIN THE BATTERY.   I FEAR THESE ARE MANUFACTURER PROBLEMS, DO I HAVE ANY OPTIONS TO GET THESE ISSUES REPAIRED?  *TR",

UPON INVESTIGATING I FOUND THAT BOTH DUST SHIELDS ON THE FRONT BRAKES WERE EXTREMELY RUSTED AND THE RUST PIECES WERE FALLING BETWEEN THE FRONT INBOARD BRAKE PADS AND REAR ROTOR SURFACES CAUSING EXTREME CONTAMINATION OF THE BACKSIDE OF BOTH ROTORS TO THE POINT THAT LESS THAN 50% CONTACT SURFACE WAS LEFT.  SINCE THE INBOARD BRAKE PADS DO MORE STOPPING THAN THE OUTSIDE BRAKE PADS IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  TO ADD TO THE DANGER THE FRONT BRAKING SYSTEM DOES ABOUT 75% OF A VEHICLES TOTAL BRAKING.  AND, IF IT HAPPENS ON A LONG DOWN HILL GRADE WITH ALLOT OF BRAKING, IT CAN CAUSE THE FRONT BRAKE FLUID TO BOIL INSIDE THE CALIPERS GIVING SOMEONE ONE HELL-OF-A WILD RIDE.  IN FACT, ONE DAY I HAD TO HIT THE BRAKES WITHOUT HAVING TIME TO PUMP THEM AND JUST ABOUT HIT A KID ON A BIKE THAT DARTED OUT FROM BETWEEN 2 CARS.  THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I HAD BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  I SUSPECT FORD HAS BEEN LOVING IT BECAUSE NON-MECHANICAL PEOPLE WILL NEVER KNOW OR FIND OUT AND FORD WILL JUST RIP PEOPLE OFF FOR A MAJOR BRAKE OVERHAUL IN THE TUNE OF $600.00 AND THROW EVERYTHING AWAY SO NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GRADUAL DEGRADATION OF BRAKING.  THE FIX IS TO REPLACE BOTH DUST SHIELDS (FORD P/N=  2L3Z - 2K004 - AA) \"THE PRIMARY CAUSE\" OF THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK MANY PICTURES WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA OF ALL THE COMPONENTS AND CAN E-MAIL THEM TO NHTSA .  I ALSO HAVE ALL THE FRONT BRAKE COMPONENTS;  2 ROTORS, 4 BRAKE PADS, 2 DUST SHIELDS.  THE ROTORS ARE VERY HEAVY BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PACK EVERYTHING UP AND SEND IT TO NHTSA IF YOU PAY THE SHIPPING.    *TR",

THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND I PROCEEDED TO GO AND THEN \"POW\" THE TRUCK BEGAN TO MAKE A LOUD \"POPPING\" NOISE AND LOST ALL ENGINE POWER. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO KEEP IT RUNNING LONG ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND ON A SIDE ROAD. I HESITATED TO OPEN THE HOOD BECAUSE OF THE STRONG GASOLINE SMELL BUT IT WASN'T ON FIRE \"YET\" SO I OPENED IT AND FOUND ONE OF MY IGNITION COILS (COIL PACKS) LOOSE ON TOP OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I REALIZED THE SPARK PLUG HAD BLOWN OUT OF THE ALUMINUM CYLINDER HEAD. I WAS ABLE TO CATCH A RIDE TO THE AUTO PARTS STORE WITH COIL AND PLUG IN HAND. THE SALESMAN AT THE STORE IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND EVEN KNEW THE ENGINE WAS A 5.4L BEFORE BEING TOLD. HE SAID THAT IF I WAS LUCKY I WOULD PROBABLY JUST HAVE TO INSTALL A HELICOIL OR THREADED INSERT IN IT. THE OTHER OPTION WAS TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER HEAD. I PURCHASED NEW COIL AND PLUG THEN DROVE BACK TO MY TRUCK. I TRIED TO CLEAN THE THREADS WITH A SPARK PLUG THREAD CHASER BUT THERE WERE NO THREADS LEFT TO CLEAN. I SEARCHED THE WEB AND FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME ISSUE. SOME PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD MULTIPLE SPARK PLUGS BLOW OUT OR \"SPIT OUT\" ON THE SAME VEHICLE. WHY DOESN'T FORD HAVE A RECALL ON THIS? THE GASOLINE SMELL WAS DUE TO THE FUEL INJECTOR STILL SPRAYING WHILE THE PLUG WAS BLOWN OUT OF THE HEAD. WHAT IF IT HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE? I HAVEN'T REPAIRED IT YET BUT WILL TRY THE \"REPAIR KIT\" THAT WAS HANDED TO ME WHEN I BOUGHT THE COIL AND PLUG. I THINK FORD SHOULD RECALL ALL THE 5.4L ENGINES THAT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND INSTALL THE HELICOIL OR INSERT TO PREVENT A CUSTOMER BREAKDOWN OR A POTENTIAL VEHICLE FIRE. *TR",

TODAY, I HEARD A LOUD POP COME FROM MY ENGINE BAY AS I ACCELERATED AND THEN THE SOUND OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MASSIVE EXHAUST MANIFOLD LEAK. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE SPARK PLUG ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE ENGINE HAD EJECTED AND BROKE THE COIL WITH IT. I WAS LUCKY THAT IT HAD ONLY DAMAGED THE THREADS ON THE SPARK PLUG AND SHEARED THE COIL AT ITS MOUNT, INSTEAD OF DAMAGING THE THREADS ON THE HEAD, BUT FROM READING THE MULTIPLE OTHER STORIES ONLINE ABOUT THIS HAPPENING, IT SEEMS THAT I AM LUCKIER THAN MOST. I WAS ABLE TO REPAIR IT BY REPLACING THE SPARK PLUG, BOOT, AND COIL, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN, MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO REPLACE THE HEAD WHEN IT HAPPENS. I DON'T SEE WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL SINCE IT CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT DUE TO SCARING A DRIVER WHEN THEY HEAR A LOUD EXPLOSION IN THE ENGINE WHEN IT HAPPENS, OR POSSIBLY KILLING SOMEONE AS FUEL/AIR VAPORS ESCAPE THE ENGINE AND THE SPARK PLUG COULD POSSIBLY IGNITE IT OUTSIDE THE ENGINE, AND BEING RIGHT NEXT TO THE FUEL RAIL AND INJECTORS, POSSIBLY CAUSE MASSIVE FIRE DAMAGE WITH ITS OCCUPANTS STILL INSIDE THE VEHICLE. PLEASE TELL FORD TO RECALL THIS PROBLEM. I SEE THE FIX BEING AS SIMPLE AS PUTTING STRONGER THREAD INSERTS TO PREVENT THE SPARK PLUGS FROM EJECTING.

IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE ALUMINUM HEADS AND FORD RECOGNIZES THIS NOW AND CHANGED IT.  WELL, THEY DID NOT CHANGE IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVE THESE TRUCKS.  THIS SITUATION IF VERY FRUSTRATING TO ME AS A CONSUMER.  THIS COULD POSSIBLY BLOW THE ENTIRE ENGINE.  THIS VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN 10YRS OLD.  THERE ARE 4 MORE SPARK PLUGS THAT COULD GO YET.  WE DO NOT HAVE THE EXTRA MONEY TO KEEP STICKING INTO THIS TRUCK AND WE ARE IN NO FINANCIAL SITUATION TO BUY ANOTHER ONE AT THIS POINT.  WE HAVE TO GET BY WITH WHAT WE HAVE, BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH THIS MESS. IN MY OPINION AND OTHERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT, FORD SHOULD RECALL THIS.  THEY NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT TO THEIR CONSUMERS.    THANK YOU,  WILLIAM KRUMHUS *TR",

THIS PAST MONDAY (10/16/06) WHILE PULLING OUT OF A LOCAL PARKING LOT, THE #2 SPARK PLUG WAS EJECTED OUT OF THE RIGHT CYLINDER HEAD, RIPPING OUT THE THREADS THAT THE SPARK PLUG SCREWS INTO & DESTROYING THE COIL PACK LOCATED DIRECTLY ABOVE.  MY TRUCK ON THE DAY OF FAILURE HAD 81,790 MILES ON IT.  THAT'S 18,210 MILES SHORT IF THE TRUCKS FIRST MANUFACTURES SUGGESTED 100,000 MILE TUNE-UP.  FORD WILL NOT EVEN CONSIDER THE THOUGHT OF MAKING THIS MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT RIGHT.  THEY SIMPLY TOLD ME THAT THE HEAD WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE AND AT THE COST OF $2,800.00 TO $3,000.00. IT'S A DESIGN FLAW!!!  THE ALUMINUM HEADS FOR THE 5.4 L ENGINES WERE ENGINEERED WITH AN INADEQUATE NUMBER OF THREADS NEEDED TO RETAIN THE SPARK PLUGS.  THERE ARE ONLY 4 TO 5 THREADS TAPPED INTO THESE HEADS (APPROX. 1/4\" TO 5/16\" IN LENGTH) TODAY IS OCTOBER 19TH AND I HAVE PURCHASED A REPAIR KIT MANUFACTURED BY DORMAN PRODUCTS TO FIX THIS STRIPPED OUT SPARK PLUG MYSELF.  THIS KIT IS SPECIFICALLY MADE BY DORMAN NOT FORD, TO FIX THIS PROBLEM OF FORDS 5.4L ENGINES. IT'S REALLY SAD THAT FORD HAS TO USE THE CONSUMERS AS GUINEA PIGS AND THEN FAIL SO MISERABLY TO BACK THEIR PRODUCT.  I'M HESITANT TO CHECK THE TORQUE OF THE OTHER SEVEN PLUGS IN FEAR THAT THEY WILL NOT WITHSTAND THE RECOMMENDED 25 FOOT POUNDS OF TORQUE REQUIRED TO TIGHTEN THEM UP BUT IF I DON'T THEN IT'S RUSSIA ROULETTE AS TO WHEN THE NEXT ONE WILL BLOW OUT AND WHERE I WILL BE STRANDED WHEN IT DOES. I EXPECT FORD TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT 110%, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT BY FORD AND THE CONSUMER THAT THERE IS AN ENGINEERING FLAW WITH THE DESIGN OF THE 5.4L ENGINES ALUMINUM HEADS PRODUCED BETWEEN YEARS OF 1997 THROUGH 2002.  *NM",

WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT OUT OF POCKET AND IF THE GEM WAS HARMED, WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED TOO (AT A TUNE OF $1600).

SLOWING UP AS I NEARED THE TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF ME, I NOTICED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME SLOWED ALMOST TO A STOP TO ALLOW TWO VEHICLES FROM THE LEFT LANE TO MERGE IN FRONT OF IT. SUDDENLY, THE VEHICLE CAME TO AN ABRUPT STOP UNEXPECTEDLY THEREBY ALERTING ME TO INSTANTLY STOP MY VEHICLE TO AVOID AN IMPACT TO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. AS I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY (INSTANTLY), THE TRUCK BEGAN TO SLOW UP AND \"SHUTTER\" OR A \"PULSATING\" MOTION OF SLOWING DOWN. THE TRUCK CAME CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME, BUT DID NOT STOP!!!! THIS SHUTTERING OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM WAS THE ABS SYSTEM BECOMING ACTIVATED. BECAUSE OF THIS ACTIVATION, MY VEHICLE FAILED TO STOP IN TIME AND THUS IMPACTING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME WITH MINOR DAMAGE. AFTER I EVENTUALLY STOPPED, I NOTICED I DID LEAVE SKID MARKS ON THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATION, PAVEMENT WAS DRY. I FEEL THAT UNDER NORMAL HYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEM, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED IN TIME TO AVOID THIS MISHAP. I DID HAVE ENOUGH TIME AND DISTANCE TO STOP TO AVOID THE MISHAP. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS ABS SYSTEM HAS ENGAGED ITSELF PRIOR TO MY STOPPING DUE TO STOPPED VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME. I HAVE YET TO HAVE AN EVALUATION DONE ON THE TRUCK TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A DEFECT SINCE THE ABS SYSTEM, WITHOUT QUESTION, DOES ENGAGE AS IT SHOULD. MY CONCERN IS THAT ABS DOES NOT LOCK UP THE BRAKES AS IT IS DESIGNED TO DO, HOWEVER, THIS CAUSES THE VEHICLE FROM FULLY STOPPING WHEN NECESSARY. I DON'T THINK THIS WAS PART OF IT'S INTENDED DESIGN. THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR DEATHS IN EITHER OF MY MISHAPS, HOWEVER, THESE WERE SLOW SPEEDS. *JB",

REPAIR TIME WAS LONGER THAN USUAL AS THE PART HAD TO BE ORDERED FROM OUT-OF-STATE AND EXPEDITED SHIPPING WAS DEEMED TOO EXPENSIVE.     AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THE ENGINE MISFIRES CONTINUOUSLY AT IDLE AND FREQUENTLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP FOR A 3RD TIME TO INVESTIGATE THIS CONTINUING CONDITION.   *NM",

THERE WAS DAMAGE TO MY HOMNE FROM THE FIRE, AND THE INSIDE OF MY HOME IS STILL GETTING DAMAGED BY PLASTIC SOOTY MESS.  I DROVE MY TRUCK FROM LOUISIANA TO WEST VIRGINIA THE PRIOR WEEK. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP, THE CRUISE CONTROL MALFUNCTIONED AND QUIT WORKING. I PLANNED ON TAKING IT TO FORD FOR REPAIR AFTER THE HOLIDAY. THE TRUCK CAUGHT FIRE ON 4TH OF JULY NIGHT BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO REPAIR. I HEARD OF THE FORD RECALL ON THE CRUISE CONTROL MALFUNCTION / FIRE AFTER THE FIRE.  I CONTACTED FORD ABOUT THIS WITH MY VIN #. THEY ARE SAYING THAT MY NUMBER WAS NOT IN THE RECALL, THEREFORE I DID NOT GET A NOTICE FOR RECALL. I THINK MY VIN # BATCH SHOULD BE RECALLED. IF I WOULD HAVE PARKED IT IN A GARAGE, MY HOME AND FAMILY COULD HAVE SUFFERED INJURY / DEATH DUE TO THIS HAPPENING AT 1:00 AM, EVERYONE SLEEPING.  I AM TRYING TO GET FORD TO OWN UP TO RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKE GOOD THEIR PRODUCT. ANY HELP OR LAWYER WORKING ON CASE WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PURSUE THIS.",

ONCE THERE, I RAISED THE HOOD AND FOUND THAT THE NUMBER TWO SPARK PLUG HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD.  IT DESTROYED THE COIL PACK AS WELL.  IT APPEARS THAT WHEN THE PLUG BLEW, IT SHOT UP INTO THE COIL PACK THEREBY DESTROYING THE COIL.  SINCE THE IGNITION WIRE IS PART OF THE COIL PACK, IT FURTHER APPEARS THAT THE COMPRESSION OF THE RUBBER INSULATOR ACTED LIKE A SPRING AND PUSHED THE PLUG BACK INTO THE ORIFACE WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO BREAK THE WHITE INSULATOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLUG AND AND SLAM THE TIP INTO THE ELECTRODE.     I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE PLUG WITHOUT INCIDENT.  I DID NOT FIND ANY REMNANTS OF ALUMINUM IN THE SPARK PLUG THREADS.  SINCE THE PLUGS WERE CHANGED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO, I STILL HAD THE OLD PLUGS.  THE DAMAGED PLUG WAS REPLACED WITH ONE OF THE OLD PLUGS.  THE THREADS FELT AS THOUGH THEY WERE STILL INTACT, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET THE REPLACEMENT PLUG BACK IN WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATIONS.  IT WAS TIGHTENED DOWN, JUST SNUG, NOT TIGHT.  THE COIL PACK ON THAT CYLINDER HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST FROM AUTOZONE WAS APPROXIMATELY $45.00.

WHILE IN INDIANA A MAN WAS NICE ENOUGH TO FLAG ME DOWN TO LET ME KNOW THAT MY BREAK LIGHTS WERE NOT WORKING.  I TOOK THE TRUCK TO EBY FORD SALES (JUNE 6, 2003) IN GOSHEN FOR REPAIR.  THEY INDICATED THAT THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH DISCONNECTED WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TILTED DOWN.  SO THEY LENGTHENED THE CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY WIRES AND THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. ON DECEMBER 17, 2001, I TOOK MY TRUCK INTO PRINCE FORD IN DOUGLAS GEORGIA AND TOLD THEM THAT MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD JUST COME ON FOR NO REASON.  THEY REPLACED THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH BUT DID NOT LENGTHEN THE WIRES.ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT EBBY FORD, THIS MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH CONTROLS SEVERAL VITAL FUNCTIONS ON THE TRUCK - BRAKE LIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, WIPERS, ETC. *AK     SEVERAL THINGS ARE WORTH NOTING HERE:    FIRST, I CALLED AND TALKED WITH PRICE FORD IN GEORGIA AND ASKED WHY THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH WIRES WERE NOT LENGTHENED WHEN THE SWITCH WAS REPLACED BY THEM THE FIRST TIME (DECEMBER 17, 2001).  THEY HAVEN'T EVEN CALLED ME BACK.    SECOND, I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND INFORMED THEM OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOTE THE PROBLEM BUT THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL AT THIS TIME.    FINALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS CRASHES RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT THE SWITCH WIRES ON THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH ASSEMBLY IS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND THAT THE SWITCH DISCONNECTS WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TILTED DOWN.

AFTER RIDING THE BRAKES FOR A COUPLE OF MILES I MANAGED TO GET OFF AN EXIT OFF OF ROUTE 1 IN CHESTER COUNTY, PA., PULLED THE TRUCK OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND, PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND QUICKLY TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  MUCH SMOKE CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD BECAUSE THE BRAKES WERE OVERHEATED.  I PULLED THE FUSE AND RESTARED THE VEHICLE.  IT REV'D TO \"RED\" LINE\".  I QUICKLY TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  HAD TRUCK TOWED TO FAULKNER FORD IN CHADDS FORD, PA. THEY FOUND THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE PRESSED AGAINST THE THROTTLE.  I ASKED IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS.  THE RESPONSE WAS \"NO, IT WAS A FLUKE.  IT HAPPENED TO BE YOU.\"  I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE AFTER THIS HARROWING EXPERIENCE.  I AM NOT PLEASED WITH HOW THIS DEALERSHIP HANDLED THIS INCIDENT.  *AK",
