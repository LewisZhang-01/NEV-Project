        "summary": "There is an open recall NHTSA #21V042 that no dealers in Colorado can repair until March 2022. Parts are available but they claim to be book through March due to all the current recalls. This is a safety issue since wet conditions can cause the sensor to disable the electronic stability control. This is on a 4x4 vehicle that will be used during the winter in Colorado. I would like to have an authorized Mercedes repair facility do the repair since the dealer is not able to accommodate a reasonable timeline.",
