Dealership ran a diagnostic on it and informed me it needed an updated software flash. Conducted the Flash. NOW... the vehicle is inoperable without a complete Electronic Shift Module (ESM) replacement. They could not even reverse what they did so I could drive home. What they did was IRREVERSIBLE and I would have to leave the car there until they could find a NEW ESM and install it for $900! I had to take a Uber home and have no vehicle. This is not right for a vehicle with only 55K miles that was running just fine into the Jeep dealership. This is a very common problem on JEEP Cherokees. If ESM is known defective part by JEEP and is a Safety risk since many owners have the shifter lock up while driving the vehicle and cannot shift without shutting down the vehicle several times in the middle of traffic.

Here are some of the articles I found with their web addresses:  Jeep RecallIn the middle of 2020, Jeep was forced to recall almost 100,000\u00a0Jeep Cherokees\u00a0due to transmission problems. Fiat Chrysler promised to install and update the new software into the specific model so that the malfunctions will not occur again \u2013 and if they do, the driver will immediately be alerted to the ongoing problem.The affected Cherokee cars had a transmission concern that could potentially lead to a loss of power while driving, causing an increased risk of a crash and safety issues. The company issued a statement at the time of the recall, addressing the potential transmission slipping, loss of propulsion, and lack of transmission engagement.The Jeep Cherokees in the recall were produced between the 2014 and 2017 model years, with the affected models having an extremely high Jeep transmission repair cost and safety concerns. The models are almost exclusively all-wheel-drive options between 2014-2-17, with a two-speed Power Transfer Unit.\u00a0https://www.cashcarsbuyer.com/jeep-transmission-repair-cost/ While the 2015 transmission receives a lot of notice, there are other vehicles in the Jeep Grand Cherokee lineup that have also had problems reported by consumers. One key complaint is repeated in the 2016 and 2017 model years.In these vehicles, the driver notes the vehicle lurches forward when the gas pedal is depressed, specifically when making a turn. This can increase the risk of an accident.Others report that while they are driving the vehicle",

I waited 5 hours at the dealership to be told once they replaced the part that the car would not move out of park. I then got a call telling me the entire shifter would need to be replaced and would not be covered under warranty. There was no actual issue with my vehicle before I dropped it off at the dealership. The car was shifting between park, drive, neutral, reverse without any issues. They also told me they would try to put the old part back on to see if it was a faulty part. They quoted me $617 for a part that before today I did not need. This is absolutely ridiculous as there are multiple forums and feeds online about Jeep Grand Cherokees having this issue.

IF EITHER STEERING TIRE ON THE JEEP HITS AN IRREGULARITY IN THE ROAD SURFACE (I.E. A BUMP, MANHOLE COVER, POTHOLE), THE STEERING WHEELS ON THE JEEP BEGIN RAPIDLY TURNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND BACK AGAIN. THIS ACTION VIOLENTLY SHAKES NOT ONLY THE JEEP BUT THE ENTIRE MOTORHOME TOWING IT. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE OSCILLATING WHEELS IS TO BRAKE HARD AND NEARLY COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE BRAKING SYSTEM ON THE JEEP WHEN IT IS BEING TOWED IS OPERATED BY THE AIR BRAKES ON THE MOTORHOME THROUGH A SYSTEM THAT APPLIES THE BRAKES AS NEEDED (THE TOW BRAKING SYSTEM IS MANUFACTURED BY SMI AND CALLED THE AIR FORCE ONE SYSTEM). OF THE FOUR TIMES IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME OVER THE PAST YEAR, ONE WAS WHILE TURNING LEFT ONTO A FOUR-LANE DIVIDED HIGHWAY. I PULLED INTO THE LEFT (PASSING) LANE TO ACCELERATE BUT HAD TO NEARLY STOP TO GET THE JEEP TO STOP WOBBLING. A SEMI TRUCK IN THE RIGHT LANE HAD TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE HE SAW ME STOPPING AND NEEDED TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY ACTION IN CASE I VEERED RIGHT. IT WAS A SCARY MOMENT.    THIS PROBLEM IS BEING TALKED ABOUT EXTENSIVELY IN RV FORUMS (SEE HTTP://WWW.IRV2.COM/FORUMS/F85/JEEP-GRAND-CHEROKEE-DEATH-WOBBLE-339594.HTML) AND THE PROBLEMS ARE IDENTICAL FOR ALL THE OWNERS OF 2016 OR LATER JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES.

I ACTUALLY DUCKED DOWN IN MY SEAT LOOKING INTO MY REAR & SIDEVIEW MIRRORS. THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND ME. IT WAS PARTLY CLOUDY & 60 DEGREES. I BEGAN HEARING WIND IN THE VEHICLE. I DECIDED TO STOP & CHECK THINGS OUT. LOOKING ON TOP OF THE ROOF I NOTICED A LARGE HOLE IN THE SUNROOF W/BROKEN GLASS LYING ON THE SHADE GUARD. I TURNED AROUND & HEADED TOWARDS THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP SEEKING THE ADVISE OF THE SERVICE MANAGER. HE & HIS STAFF WERE QUESTIONED ABOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF EXPLODING SUNROOFS & THEIR REPLY WAS NO. THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TOO CONCERNED W/MY SAFETY EITHER! ACCORDING TO CONSUMER REPORTS.ORG THE ISSUE IS WELL KNOWN WITHIN THE AUTO INDUSTRY & GOVERNMENT REGULATORS. ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATIONS AUTO MAKERS ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING OR MAKING AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. SAFETY STANDARDS & REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF SUNROOFS HAVE NOT KEPT PACE W/DRAMATIC SIZE & DESIGN CHANGES. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GUARANTEE THEY ARE SAFE. THE BIGGER THE EXPANSE OF GLASS, THE HARDER TO ENSURE IT WON'T SHATTER. WHY SHATTERING UNDER NORMAL USE? THE VEHICLE/GLASS IS JUST TWO YEARS OLD. I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY ISSUES W/SUNROOFS SHATTERING. I WOULDN'T PURPOSELY JEOPARDIZE MY SAFETY NOR THAT OF MY PASSENGERS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER PUBLIC AWARENESS. TRANSPARENCY PLEASE",

THEY THEN CHANGED THE 2ND (MAIN) BATTERY. PROBLEM REMAINED. THEN FINALLY THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE BATTERY WIRES WAS NOT SECURELY CONNECTED TO THE STARTER VIA A CONNECTOR. THEY HAVE PUT A NEW CONNECTOR. IT IS A SCARY SITUATION, AND CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF LIFE ON ROAD. IF IT KNOCKS OFF THE ENGINE BEHIND A TRAFFIC JAM AND DOES NOT START BACK IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND EVEN DEATH. IT IS ONLY 6 MONTH OLD BRAND NEW CAR AND I DID NOT EXPECT THIS PROBLEM. IT CAN NOT BE EASILY PUT IN NEUTRAL GEAR IF ENGINE CAN NOT BE STARTED WHICH IS A MAJOR TRAFFIC HAZARD. THIS NEEDS TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND RECALLED.

HOWEVER WE ARE AFRAID THAT SINCE THE DEALERSHIPS HAVE A RAPO ESTABLISHED WITH THE COMPANY THEY MIGHT OVERLOOK THIS CASE AND SINCE WE ARE ONE CUSTOMER VS THE DEALERSHIP THERE ARE MORE CHANCES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SUFFER AND TAKE THE CONTINUOUS THREATS FROM THE DEALERSHIP. WE WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH NHTSA TO PROVIDE US A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS AND HELP US RECEIVE JUSTICE ON THIS CASE . OUR CASE NUMBER WITH JEEP IS [XXX] . THIS IS OUR FIRST BRAND NEW VEHICLE AND WE HAVE HAD ISSUES FROM DAY ONE ON THE VEHICLE AND WITH DEALERSHIP TREATING US IN AN EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL WAY AND LITERALLY THREATENING US WE DONT KNOW HOW TO PROCEED IN THIS CASE .  WE DID NOT REALIZE IT TILL OUR DAUGHTER DROPPED STUFF UNDER THE SEATS  AND CAME OUT FEW TIMES WITH RUSTED HANDS . SHE HAS BEEN TRAVELLING AND BREATHING IN THE RUSTED CAR FOR FEW DAYS AND THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE HEALTH HAZARD FOR THE KID.  WE ARE CONFUSED AT THIS POINT AND FEEL HELPLESS . DO WE JUST WAIT FOR FCA TO COME BACK TO US OR DO WE FILE A COMPLAINT IN THE LOCAL COURT AND FIGHT A CASE AGAINST THE DEALER SHIP ? PLEASE ADVISE.

        "summary": "18 DAYS AFTER PURCHASING MY GRAND CHEROKEE THE CAR SUDDENLY FELT LIKE IT WAS DRAGGING SOMETHING AND HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MOVING.  IT FELT LIKE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS ON, BUT THE WAS NOT LIGHT INDICATOR.    WHEN WE PULLED OVER THE WHEELS WERE RED HOT AND WHEN WE DROPPED WATER ON IT TO SEE HOW HOT IT WAS THE WATER SIZZLED. WE ENGAGED AND THEN DISENGAGED THE PARKING BRAKE JUST TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T ON FOR SOME REASON.  WE HAD THE CAR PUT ON A FLATBED AND TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP.  A WEEK LATER THEY SAID IT WAS FIXED, WE PICKED IT UP DROVE IT THE 23 MILES HOME AND PARKED IT. THE NEXT MORNING ON THE WAY TO WORK IT DID THE SAME THING. A FLATBED CAME AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN.  THE DEALERSHIP DROVE IT AND THEY EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAD TO HAVE A FLATBED COME PICK IT UP. WE WERE TOLD THAT THE BRAKES WERE ENGAGING WITHOUT WARNING AND IT WOULD BE FIXED.  THE REPLACED EVERYTHING IN THE REAR BRAKES AND WE WAITED A MONTH FOR A MODULE TO BE INSTALLED.  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND SAID IT WAS FIXED.  AGAIN, WE PICKED UP THE CAR, DROVE THE 23 MILES HOME AND PARKED THE CAR FOR THE EVENING.  THE NEXT MORNING ON THE WAY TO WORK THE BRAKES ENGAGED AGAIN AND WE HAD TO HAVE THE CAR PUT ON A FLATBED ONCE AGAIN. EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENED IT WAS ON A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ROAD, GOING DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON. THERE WASN'T ANY HARD BRAKING HAPPENING TO MAKE THE BRAKES ENGAGE. IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING THIS WOULD HAPPEN.  IN THE 9 WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP, WE HAVE ONLY HAD POSSESSION OF THE CAR FOR 20 DAYS!!!  WE ARE BEING TOLD THE CAR IS FIXED AND WE CAN COME GET THE VEHICLE.  I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE AND DO NOT WANT IT BACK.  I'M LOOKING TO HAVE THE CAR TAKEN BACK UNDER THE RIGHTS OF THE LEMON LAW AND WILL BE INVOLVING A THIRD PARTY TO HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN.",

        "summary": "THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS A \"SAFETY\" FEATURE CALLED AUTOMATIC HIGH-BEAMS, A FEATURE THEY CHARGE AN ADDITIONAL FEE FOR.    THE FEATURE ITSELF CAN BE TURNED ON/OFF ONLY THROUGH THE UCONNECT SYSTEM OF SETTINGS, WHILE THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED. THE ACTUAL FEATURE ONCE TURNED ON CAN BE ENABLED AND DISABLED THROUGH THE TURN SIGNAL STALK (PUSHING FORWARD TO ENABLE, BACK TO DISABLE)    ONCE THE FEATURE IS TURNED ON VIA UCONNECT, THERE IS NO WAY TO MANUALLY TURN ON YOUR HIGH-BEAMS EXCEPT BY PULLING BACK ON THE TURN SIGNAL STALK TO ENABLE YOUR FLASH-TO-PASS HIGH-BEAMS.     THIS ALLOWS THE HIGH-BEAMS TO TURN ON FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 SECONDS BEFORE THEY AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF, EVEN IF YOU ARE STILL HOLDING THE STALK BACK TOWARDS YOU.    THE REASON THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT THE UCONNECT SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY DISABLES AUTOMATIC HIGH-BEAMS AT SPEEDS OF 15MPH OR LESS. ONCE THIS FEATURE IS AUTOMATICALLY DISABLED, IT CANNOT BE RE-ENABLED UNTIL YOU HIT A SPEED OF 23MPH, AT THIS POINT THE AUTOMATIC HIGH-BEAMS IS RE-ENABLED BY THE UCONNECT SYSTEM.    WHERE THIS BECOMES AN INCREASED SAFETY ISSUE IS ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS WITH SPEED LIMITS OF 20MPH.    THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN ON YOUR HIGH BEAMS ON RESIDENTIAL ROADS, UNLESS YOU ARE ABLE TO TURN ONTO THE RESIDENTIAL ROAD WHERE THE LIGHTS WERE PREVIOUSLY AUTOMATICALLY ENABLED (IE DRIVING ABOVE 23MPH) AND YOU KEEP YOUR VEHICLE SPEED ABOVE 15MPH.     THE ONLY WAY TO TURN ON YOUR HIGH BEAMS IN THIS SITUATION IS TO DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  1- BREAK THE SPEED LIMIT TO REACH 23 MPH THEN DROP BACK DOWN TO THE LEGAL SPEED LIMIT (SO NOT AN OPTION).  2- DRIVE WITH 1 HAND ON THE WHEEL, WHILE HOLDING BACK THE TURN-SIGNAL STALK TO ENABLE FLASH TO PASS HIGH-BEAMS, AND EVERY 6 SECONDS RESETTING THE STALK AFTER THEY TURN OFF.  3- STOP YOUR VEHICLE, ENTER THE UCONNECT SYSTEM ON THE RADIO, CHANGE THE SETTINGS TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC HIGH-BEAM FEATURE.  *TR",
