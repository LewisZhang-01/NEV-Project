THE SPEED OF TRAVEL WAS AROUND 70 MILES PER HOUR AND I WAS 200 MILES SOUTH OF ATLANTA.    AT THAT TIME, 17:00 P.M., I FELT A VERY LOUD NOISE ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR AND THEN A FLURRY OF STRANGE ELEMENTS THAT HIT THE ROOF AND BACK OF THE CAR. WHEN I PARKED, I NOTICED THAT IT WAS THE SUNROOF OF THE CAR THAT, FOR NO APPARENT REASON, EXPLODED INTO MILLIONS OF PIECES.    WHEN I WAS DRIVING, THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT NOR THE SIDE, SO I RULE OUT THAT A STONE HIT.    THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE, THEY ARE CHECKING IT FOR REPAIR. THEY GAVE ME A REPLACEMENT CAR UNTIL THE REPAIR IS READY.    IN ADDITION TO THE FRIGHT AND HIGH RISK THAT I HAD ON THE HIGHWAY, I AM FINE, BUT VERY WORRIED THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I TRAVEL NORMALLY EVERY 60 DAYS APPROXIMATELY 1,000 MILES AND I DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS HIGH RISK TO MY INTEGRITY, COMPANIONS AND CARS NEARBY.    GLASSES SCRATCHED THE PAINT ON THE BACK OF THE ROOF AND THE TRUNK.    I HOPE YOU CAN ASSURE ME THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE CAR. I WAS VERY LUCKY TO BE DRIVING WITH THE INSIDE WINDOW OF THE ROOF CLOSED, OTHERWISE I WOULD BE TELLING A VERY SERIOUS TRAGEDY.
