I'm writing you about my 2014 Toyota Corolla which I bought from Glendale KIA dealership (400 S. Brand st, Glendale, CA, ) in Feb ,2022 with a Gold Warranty. It is about selling old (may be used) 2020 four tires to me instead of 2022 tires. I paid for NEW tires and I have the invoice(and credit card transaction ,..) They told me first I only told them NEW tires and I didn't mention 2022 and those tires which are from 2020 are good. Their supervisor on Monday offered me a FULL TANK OF GAS for free  instead of new tires and when I said no and I want four new tires 2022. He told me to go there again (Wednesday 03/23/2022)  to get new tires but they tried to give me 2020 tires again. I asked them I want to talk with store manger , they said manager is off and when I asked that specific Employee name , he didn't respond  and tried to go to other room and I started recording his video and he tried to grab my phone by force . I came out and called 911.The police officers came and went inside of the dealership and stayed with me to take my car outside (with out getting new tires and I'm still have the 2020 tires that they gave me on Monday).I emailed the manager and other guys several times before that day but they didn't respond . They never called back my VM. The scheduling links of their website is broken and from March 15 I tried to email and call them but they never respond. One more thing , after police officers came one of their associates text me by his personal cell number ,. Most of the employees are Arabs and I think they are kind of family and friends  Their employees have access to my information(Social Security, My family home address, cellphone,..)in 2019 in California , we had some legal laws for tire age for dealerships . I I f I get an accident because of my tires who will be responsible, I paid for new tires for my safety and others.",

This presents a large safety risk, as the driver can be become heavily distracted operating the system.     Per my research, this is a widespread problem across the entire Toyota lineup and affects many models and multiple years around 2014 (particular after 2014).   You can easily find this problem reported across the internet in many forums and Youtube videos.   Although Toyota has issued some TSB's, it looks like, they are only covered in warranty.   Toyota refuses to take responsibility for it and does not have any recalls for and the dealer will charge around $1000 to fix it, by changing the infotainment system.",

THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR WHICH WAS A MONTH AGO.

THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY AFTER I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY BUT THEN IT RETURNED LAST WEEK.

IT CONTINUES TO HESITATE TO ALMOST STALLING OUT DURING TAKEOFF AT RED LIGHTS AND INTERSECTIONS. IT'S ACCELERATION IS TERRIBLE EVEN FOR A 4 CYLINDER. WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE FOR THE 3 YEARS WITH TOYOTA, BUT NOW THAT THE WARRANTY IS VOID DUE TO THE 3 YEARS, AND NOT THE MILEAGE, WE NO LONGER RECEIVE SUCH A HELPFUL CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THE MANAGERS THERE. THE CAR IS STILL UNDER  25,000 MILES, AND HAS BEEN A TOTAL LEMON TO US. WE'VE EXHAUSTED ALL HOPES OF THEM FIXING THE REAL PROBLEM SINCE THEY CONTINUE TO CLAIM THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY SUCH PROBLEM IN THE ACCELERATION ISSUES AND STALLING IN THE INTERSECTIONS. WE WILL NEVER AGAIN PURCHASE A TOYOTA VEHICLE EVER AGAIN. WE HAVE PURCHASED MANY TOYOTA'S IN THE PAST, WHICH PROMPTED US TO BUY ANOTHER.

THE PROBLEM IS WHEN I STOP AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT I MUST PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON BRAKE PEDAL & PRESS IT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AS FAR AS IT WILL GO OTHERWISE CAR WILL START TO ROLL. I HAD IT CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES AT TOYOTA DEALERS & NO ONE CAN FIND ANYTHING WRONG SO I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH IT. LAST WEEK I HAD A CHANCE TO DRIVE A DIFFERENT 2014 TOYOTA COROLLA & BRAKE REACTIONS DIFFERENT I DID NOT HAVE TO PRESS DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS HARD OR AS FAR AS I DO WITH MINE. ON 3/17/2015 I BROUGHT MY CAR INTO TOYOTA DEALER FOR BRAKES CHECK ONLY & TECH CHECKED SYSTEM FOR CODES (?) & DID TEST DRIVE BY HIMSELF & STATED HE DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG, THEN HE DID TEST DRIVE WITH ME DRIVING TO SEE IF I COULD 'RECREATE' THE ISSUE & ALTHOUGH THIS TECH ADMITTED HE COULD SEE I HAD THE BRAKE PEDAL PUSHED DOWN TO THE FLOOR THE ROLLING AT LIGHT DID NOT OCCUR (OF COURSE).THE TECH TOLD ME AS FAR AS THE OTHER 2014 COROLLA'S BRAKE PEDAL REACTIONS THAT TOYOTA MIGHT HAVE DRUM BRAKES ON IT (?) & MY CAR HAS DISC BRAKES.THE TECH ALSO TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO ADJUST, FIX OR REPAIR DISC BRAKES(?) WILL HAVE TO TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT. IN ANY EVENT I WAS TOLD ME TO KEEP A WATCH IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, ALSO IF CAR IS COLD OR HOT & SOMETIMES  CAR WILL ROLL AUTOMATICALLY AT A LIGHT DUE TO A/C GOING ON & OFF & REGULATING ITSELF (WILL HAVE TO TAKE TECH'S WORD).THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS AT A STOP LIGHT IF I DON'T HOLD THAT BRAKE PEDAL DOWN HARD & AS FAR TO THE FLOOR AS I CAN THE CAR WILL ROLL WHICH TO ME IS DANGEROUS; HAVEN'T HIT ANYONE OR ANYTHING BUT TO ME THIS DOESN'T SEEM NORMAL OR RIGHT TO ME.  *TR",

AT THE BLINKING LIGHT INTERSECTION OF DORSET STREET AND CHEESE FACTORY ROAD, WE MADE A RIGHT HAND TURN AND DROVE EAST. IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT AND I MIS-JUDGED THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF CHEESE FACTORY ROAD, WHERE YOU COULD EITHER TURN LEFT OR RIGHT. AT THE INTERSECTION OF CHEESE FACTORY ROAD AND HINESBURG ROAD, THERE ARE NO BLINKING LIGHTS OR REFLECTORS, AND, IN THE DARKNESS, I MISSED THE STOP SIGN, WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND CRASHED INTO A DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.

IMMEDIATELY  GETTING OUT OF THE CAR, I MOVED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE TO FIND MY WIFE OUT OF THE CAR ON HER HANDS AND KNEES, CRYING OUT THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE.

THIS VEHICLE HAD 8 MILES ON IT & WAS EQUIPPED WITH PROXES 4 PLUS 205/55/R16 TIRES ( I HAVE THE ID NUMBERS FROM EACH TIRE IF YOU NEED THEM). ON 2/26/14 THIS VEHICLE HAD 492 MILES ON IT & I NOTICED THE LEFT REAR TIRE HAD A LARGE ODD SHAPED CUT IN IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OUTSIDE TREAD AREA. I WENT TO SUNTOYOTA IN HOLIDAY FLA TOOK PICS OF THE TIRE DAMAGE & THE SERVICE REP [XXX]  TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT TIRE IN THEY WOULD HAVE TO ORDER ONE. I HAD PURCHASED ROAD HAZARD TIRE COVERAGE AT THE TIME I LEASED THE CAR & \"ASSUMED\" THIS ODD CUT CAME FROM ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN THE AREA SO I WASN'T CONCERNED. I HAD TO LEAVE THIS 2014 COROLLA AT DEALERSHIP FOR A GAS TANK ISSUE WHICH WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SO I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY PUT IN A CLAIM FOR THAT ISSUE & RENTED A CAR. ON 2/28/14 I WENT BACK TO SUNTOYOTA TO PICK UP MY CAR & WHEN I LOOKED AT THE REPLACEMENT TIRE I ASKED IF IT WAS 'NEW' & WAS TOLD YES IT WAS ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO ME IT WAS; I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS DEALER. [XXX] ALSO SAID THAT FIDELITY WARRANTY SERVICE WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT REPLACING A TIRE THAT ONLY HAD 492 MILES ON IT SO WE HAD WORDS OVER THAT. NOW ON APPROXIMATELY 3/26/14 I NOTICED THIS REPLACEMENT TIRE HAS WHAT LOOKS LIKE STRESS LINE CRACKS STRAIGHT ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE TIRE (TOOK PICS) IN 2 PLACES & CAR ONLY HAS 644 MILES ON IT. OBVIOUSLY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS & MY SAFETY AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF OTHERS RIDING NEAR ME SHOULD THIS TIRE COME APART. I HAVE LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS TIRE BUT CANNOT FIND ANY RECENT ONES. I WILL ONCE AGAIN REPORT THIS ISSUE TO SE TOYOTA BUT I AM REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE NOT ONLY WITH THE TIRE BUT DEFINITELY WITH THIS DEALER & SERVICE DEPARTMENT BUT NEED TO PROTECT MY SAFETY IN THE EVENT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THESE TIRES. 2014 COROLLA'S ALSO HAVE \"DESIGN FLAWS\"..
