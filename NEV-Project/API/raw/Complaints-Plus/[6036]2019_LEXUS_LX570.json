        "summary": "CAR HAS LESS THAN 5K MILES. ON 5 INSTANCES, I OPENED THE POWER LIFTGATE BY DEPRESSING THE BUTTON ON THE LIFTGATE. AS I LOADED/UNLOADED ITEMS FROM THE CAR, THE LIFTGATE CLOSED DOWN ON ME WITH NO BEEPING OR SENSING THAT BODIES WERE PRESENT. ONE INSTANCE HAPPENED WHERE THE LIFTGATE PRESSED ON THE BACK OF MY DAUGHTER'S HEAD PUSHING HER DOWN TO THE BASE OF THE CARGO AREA. ALL 5 INSTANCES OCCURRED ON FLAT SURFACES WITH THE VEHICLE OFF AND IN VERY HOT TEMPERATURES. MY LOCAL LEXUS SERVICE DEPT WAS ABLE TO RECREATE THIS BY LEAVING MY CAR OUT IN 90 DEGREE WEATHER. THEY INFORMED ME MINE WAS THE 2ND LEXUS TO REPORT THIS SAFETY ISSUE. THEY WILL BE REPLACING THE MOTOR AND ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE POWER LIFTGATE. OBVIOUSLY, THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH THE GATE BACK UP DESPITE IT PUSHING DOWN TO CLOSE.",
