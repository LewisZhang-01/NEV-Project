I was on the interstate a few days later from the first stutter when it occurred again but more pronounced. I do remember that I was accelerating at about 40% throttle because I was in a rush, and I believed the throttle intensity played a role in the abruptness of the stutter. When I reached the interstate I came to a cruising speed of around 70 and engaged the cruise. I noticed that it was behaving oddly and it would shift often to control the speed it's almost as if it's tolerances are extremely tight. The hard shifting continues but now I know to go light on the throttle to minimize impact. As for the cruise control I will only use cruise control on relatively flat roads whereas it is extremely shifty on hilly roads. (Opinion begins) I believe the adaptive cruise control should have wider tolerances I only see this as contributing to transmission degradation.",
