THERE IS A RECALL FOR 1997-1999 NISSAN MAXIMAS DUE TO A DEFECT IN THEIR ALTERNATORS THAT CAUSED THEM TO CATCH FIRE.  DETAILS ABOUT THE RECALL ARE BELOW.  MY SON WAS DRIVING HIS 1996 MAXIMA WHEN THE ALTERNATOR CAUGHT FIRE.  LUCKILY, HE ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY.  ALTHOUGH HIS CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, CLEARLY THE PART THAT STARTED THE FIRE IS THE SAME AND IT IS THE PART THAT IGNITED THE FIRE.  I SPOKE WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS THREE TIMES OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET NISSAN TO DISCUSS THIS EVENT IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY ASPECT OF IT.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY CHOSE TO LOOK AT IT STRICTLY AS A WARRANTY ISSUE.  IT STANDS TO REASON, IF THIS PART WAS IN MY SON'S CAR, IT IS ALSO IN OTHER 1996 MAXIMAS.  THE NEXT PERSON WHO EXPERIENCES A CAR FIRE DUE TO A FAULTY ALTERNATOR MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY AS MY SON.  NOTE:  I BOUGHT BACK THE ALTERNATOR FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND I HAVE IT AT HOME.

THIS CAN EVENTUALLY RESULT IN FAILURE OF THE DIODE AND AN ELECTRICAL SHORT WHICH COULD MELT THE PLASTIC HOUSING.   CONSEQUENCE:  IF THE COMBUSTIBLE GAS EMITTED BY THE MELTING PLASTIC DOES NOT DISPERSE DUE TO AIR FLOW THROUGH THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, IT COULD IGNITE AND IN TURN IGNITE THE FAN GUIDE IN THE ALTERNATOR.

I RECEIVED THE VEHICLE FROM MY FRIEND AS A GIFT, WHICH WAS IN A VERY GOOD CONDITION. AND I ALSO PAID THE BUCKNER'S AUTO SERVICE CENTER AT KNOXVILLE, TN FOR CHECKING THE CAR IN DETAIL AND GETTING IT REPAIRED. BUT 8 DAYS AFTER, THE CAR WAS ON FIRE. DURING THE 8 DAYS, THE CAR WAS PARKED IN THE PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF MY APARTMENT, AND NOBODY EVER TOUCHED THE CAR. IT'S CLOUDY OR RAINY IN ALL THESE DAYS. THOUGH FORTUNATELY MY WIFE AND I WERE SAFE, WE WERE REALLY SCARED AND MY WIFE WAS AFRAID OF VEHICLES FROM THEN ON. WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE U.S LESS THAN 2 MONTHS, AND THIS INCIDENT ALMOST COMPLETELY DISRUPTED OUR LIVES. THE FOLLOWING IS THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE KNOXVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT CRIME REPORT:  THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN FOR EIGHT DAYS. INTERVIEWED CAR OWNER, WHO STATES HE HAS BEEN IN THE US FOR ABOUT ONE MONTH, AND HAD RECEIVED THE VEHICLE AS A GIFT FROM A FRIEND. HE SAID THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE CAR FOR REPAIRS AND TO BE SERVICED AT BUCHNERS AUTO REPAIR ON 9/8/2009 AND HAD AN INVOICE OF THE WORK PERFORMED. HE SAID THAT THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN SINCE THEN BECAUSE HE WAS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING HIS DRIVER LICENSE. THERE WAS ONLY AN 8 MILE DIFFERENCE THE INVOICE MILEAGE AND THE CARS ODOMETER READING.  INVESTIGATION OF THE VEHICLE REVEALED AN ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE. THE CAR WAS LOCKED AND HOOD WAS SECURE WHEN ENG 12 ARRIVED. THEN HAD TO FORCE THE HOOD SINCE THE CABLE DID NOT FUNCTION DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE. AREAS OF HIGH HEAT WERE INDICATED ON THE HOOD OVER THE BATTERY AND FUEL/AIR INTAKE LOCATIONS. ALSO OF NOTE WAS THAT THE COOLING FANS WERE DESTROYED AND ONE HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND.   THIS FIRE IS CONSIDERED TO ACCIDENTAL AND THE CAUSE TO BE A MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION. THE OWNER DOES NOT HAVE INSURANCE ON THE VEHICLE. SUGGESTED THAT THE OWNER TAKE PHOTOS AND CONTACT BUCHNERS TO CHECK FOR ANY RECALLS OR TO'S FOR THIS VEHICLE. *TR",
