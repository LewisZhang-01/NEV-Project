        "summary": "I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OR MAIMED BY A DEFECTIVE TIRE JACK THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TIRE CHANGING EQUIPMENT THAT CAME WITH A NEW IMPALA I RENTED FROM ENTERPRISE CAR RENTAL.  THE JACK BENT IN TWO WHEN I TRIED TO CRANK THE JACK HIGH ENOUGH TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE.  I HAVE A PHOTO OF THE CHINESE-MADE PART #13592351/2017.  I HAVE NOTIFIED BOTH ENTERPRISE AND GENERAL MOTORS.  IN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, IT SEEMS THAT NEITHER COMPANY INCLUDES A SAFETY CHECK OF THE TIRE JACK.  MY CONCERN IS THAT 40-50 THOUSAND IMPALAS WERE SOLD IN 2018.  CAR RENTAL COMPANIES PURCHASED THEM AS DID DEALERSHIPS.  THOUSANDS OF UNUSED, I.E. NEW TIRE JACKS MAY BE SITTING IN THE TRUNKS OF IMPALAS THROUGHOUT THE US, CANADA, ETC. AND SOME COULD BE DEFECTIVE.  THE GM EXECUTIVE OFFICE REP SAID THEY WERE GOING TO  CONTACT ENTERPRISE REGARDING THE SAFETY ISSUE.  TO ME THIS IS SHORT SIGHTED ON GM'S PART.  THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE DEFECTIVE JACK.  ARE THEY MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE THEIR TUNE, IF CONSUMERS DIE AS A RESULT OF USING THE GENERAL MOTORS PROVIDED DEFECTIVE JACKS?  STAY TUNED.",
