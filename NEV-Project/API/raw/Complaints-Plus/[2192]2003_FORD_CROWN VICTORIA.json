I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT SINCE I HAD REPAIRED THE PART FORD WOULD NOT TAKE IT BACK SO THEY COULD NOT HELP ME. I HAD THE SNEAKING FEELING I WAS BEING LIED TO. I WENT HOME AND RESEARCHED THE RECALL. I FOUND THE REPAIR DOES NOT EVEN INVOLVE REPLACING THE PART BUT TAPS INTO THE WIRING BEFORE THE MODULE. I CALLED FORD CORP AND WAS TOLD THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AS THEY WEREN'T A TECHNICIAN BUT THEY STOOD BY THEIR DEALERS DECISION.

I TRIED SEARCHING BY VIN, BUT IT KEPT TELLING ME TO ENTER A VALID VIN.  I CHECKED IT AGAIN, WROTE IT DOWN TWICE, AND TRIED AGAIN.

THE LCM HAD TO BE REPLACED AND THE SECOND ONE FAILED AS WELL AND IS CURRENTLY BEING REPLACED. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PART AND CAUSES A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS IT HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY UNTIL IT COMPLETELY FAILS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE A/C FAN OPERATION IS ALSO TIED TO THE SAME RELAY THAT FAILS IN THE LCM. FORD CLAIMS THERE'S BEEN NO RECALL ON THIS FAILURE. MY CV IS THE SPORT LX AND HAD UNDER 46000 MILES WHEN IT HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME AND LESS THAN 48000 THE SECOND TIME. OUR OTHER CV OF THE SAME YEAR IS THE DIGITAL MODEL CV. *TR",

IN EARLY FEBRUARY  I WAS DRIVING AFTER DARK AND THE HEADLAMPS SHUTOFF, THE PARK LAMPS STAYED ON BUT THE TWO WHITE HEADLAMPS SHUT OFF AND WOULDN'T COME BACK ON.  I PLAYED WITH THE SWITCH, HIGH BEAMS AND FINALLY TURNED THE CAR OFF.  UPON RESTARTING IT THE CAR THE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON.  IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE PROBLEM HAS GONE FROM A ONCE A MONTH OCCURRENCE TO A PERMANENT PROBLEM TO THE EFFECT THAT THE LIGHTS STAY ON FOR LESS THEN 2 MINUTES AFTER THE CAR IS STARTED.  AFTER THAT I MUST HOLD THE WAND BACK TO TURN ON THE HEADLAMPS THE DURATION OF MY DRIVE.  THE LIGHTS DO NOT COME BACK ON AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY IT IS HARD TO DRIVE AND CONTROL SUCH A LARGE CAR WITH ONLY ONE HAND AND I FEEL THAT ITS UNSAFE TO DRIVE A CAR WITH THE CONDITION OF THE HEADLIGHTS.  ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT THIS MAY BE A HEADLIGHT SWITCH AND AM IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING IT BUT MY MECHANIC SAID NOT TO BOTHER BECAUSE IT WAS A LIGHT CONTROL MODULE THAT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM....$480.00 FOR A SAFETY PART THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD HAVE PROBLEMS.  I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT HITTING THE DEER RUINED THE MODULE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM DIDN'T START UNTIL A MONTH AFTER I HAD MY ACCIDENT AND THE IMPACT WAS VERY LIGHT.

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

I HAD TO HAVE THE AXLE SHAFTS, BEARINGS AND SEALS REPLACED AT A COST OF $513.45. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON THE 2003 FORD CROWN VICTORIA \"FLEET\" VEHICLES (RECALL #04S16) FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. I CALLED FORD ON 8/13/04 AND FOUND OUT THAT IT ONLY APPLIED TO VEHICLES ASSEMBLED AT THE ST. THOMAS FACILITY BETWEEN 12/01 AND 12/02. THEY ALSO VERIFIED BY MY VIN# [XXX], THAT MY CAR WAS ASSEMBLED IN THE ST. THOMAS FACILITY IN 7/02. I WAS INFORMED THAT MY CAR IS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS RECALL. I ALSO FOUND THAT FORD HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) ADVISING DEALERS TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SERVICE COMPLAINTS CENTERING AROUND REAR AXLE NOISE IN THE 2003 CROWN VICTORIAS, AND TWO OTHER MODELS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO 01/01/03  AND INCLUDED ALL CHASSIS CONFIGURATIONS (NOT ONLY FLEET VEHICLES) EXCEPT HEAVY-DUTY LIMOUSINE AND HEARSE CHASSIS. ACCORDING TO FORDS RECALL INFORMATION, \"EARLY BEARING FAILURE AND ULTIMATELY AXLE SHAFT FRACTURE WOULD LEAD TO LOSS OF DRIVE FUNCTION AND COULD LEAD TO A CRASH\". I ALSO FOUND THAT IT COULD LEAD TO A WHEEL-OFF FAILURE AND A RESULTING CRASH. I ALSO FIND THAT FORD ISSUED A \"SILENT RECALL\" OR \"SECRET WARRANTY\" TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMER PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FACTORY WARRANTY (DEALER OPERATION CODE 030505A). MY CAR HAD APPROX 21000 MILES ON IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND NOW HAS APPROX 69000 MILES ON IT. IN MY OPINION, FORD IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS DECIDED TO BE SELECTIVE IN WHICH VEHICLES THEY ARE RECALLING WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON.
