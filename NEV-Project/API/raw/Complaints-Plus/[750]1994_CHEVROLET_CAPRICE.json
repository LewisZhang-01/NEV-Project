IT ALSO WAS FAILING QUITE OFTEN WHILE TURNING AT VERY LOW OR NO SPEED. THE POWER STEERING PUMP WAS REPLACED. (REMAN FROM AC DELCO). I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE FLUID WAS BROWN AND THICK.

I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR OVER ONE YEAR AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE WINDOWS BEFORE.  I CONTACTED A AUTOMOTIVE GLASS REPAIR SHOP AND STARTED TELLING HIM OF THE PROBLEM AND HE STOPPED ME AND SAID \"LET ME GUESS YOU HAVE A CHEVY IMPALA OR CAPRICE\"  AFTER I TOLD HIM THAT YES I DID IN FACT HAVE A CAPRICE HE SAID THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM, AND IT WOULD COST ABOUT $100 PER DOOR TO FIX, BUT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, THE PART COULD BREAK AT ANY TIME, IT IS A PLASTIC KNUCKLE THAT HOLD THE WINDOW IN PLACE.
