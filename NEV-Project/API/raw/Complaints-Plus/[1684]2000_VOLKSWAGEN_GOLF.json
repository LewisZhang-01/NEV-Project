ROSEVILLE VOLKSWAGEN IS LOCATED AT 830 AUTOMALL DR., ROSEVILLE, CA  95661-3023 AND THE PHONE NUMBER THERE IS (916) 774-2777. DURING THE 30,000 MILE SERVICE, THE TECHNICIAN INDICATED ON THE MAINTENANCE WORKSHEET THAT THE FRONT BRAKE PADS HAD 95% REMAINING WHILE THE REAR BRAKE PADS HAD ONLY 25% REMAINING, INDICATING A SERIOUS BRAKE SYSTEM ANOMALY. THE TECHNICIAN \"INSTALLED NEW BRAKE PADS DUE TO PREMATURE WEAR\" AS NOTED ON INVOICE #VWCS28623. I WAS NOT CHARGED FOR THE BRAKE PADS EVEN THOUGH I WAS OVER MY 24,000/2 YEAR WARRANTY. THE PREMATURE REAR BRAKE PAD WEAR NOTED COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS HAZARD FOR ME, MY FAMILY, AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. I BELIEVE THAT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT RESULTED IN THE PREMATURE BRAKE PAD WEAR WAS NOT ADDRESSED AT THE TIME OF SERVICE AND THAT THIS REMAINS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN IN THE FUTURE. I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE MORE VW GOLF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THAT MAY BE UNSAFE TO DRIVE DUE TO THIS IRREGULAR BRAKE PAD WEAR.  THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED NO EXPLANATION FOR THE IRREGULAR BRAKE PAD WEAR AT THE TIME THE SERVICE WAS COMPLETED. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY PHONE AND IN WRITING IN AN EFFORT TO FIND OUT HOW COMMON THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT THE EXPLANATION FOR THE IRREGULAR BRAKE PAD WEAR IS, ETC. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA HAS RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS WITH A LETTER SUGGESTING THAT I TAKE MY QUESTIONS UP WITH MY PREFERRED VOLKSWAGEN DEALER.

WHEN I WENT TO POWER BACK UP, THE WINDOW WOULD NOT MOVE AND IT MADE A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE. THE WINDOW WAS FROZEN IN THE DOWN POSITION. THE WINDOW WAS RARELY POWERED UP/DOWN IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF USE. WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO SCHEDULE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT WITH A LOCAL DEALERSHIP (NOT NIELLO), I COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS. DUE TO MY BUSY WORK SCHEDULE, ONE FORTY-FIVE DOLLAR CAB RIDE TO WORK, AND A RECENTLY EXPIRED AUTOMOBILE WARRANTY, I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO REPAIR THE CAR. AFTER CAREFULLY REMOVING THE GLASS, THE INTERNAL DOOR PANEL, AND ELECTRICAL WIRING HARNESS, HE REMOVED THE INTERNAL DOOR PANEL/LIFTER ASSEMBLY. THE PROBLEM WAS IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE. A POORLY DESIGNED, CHEAPLY MANUFACTURED, INFERIOR PLASTIC SLIDER HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RESIST THE WEIGHT OF THE WINDOW, THE RESISTANCE OF THE RISER, OR THE PULL OF THE CABLE WHEN POWERED BY THE WINDOW REGULATOR. ON MAY 29, 2002, I VISITED ROSEVILLE VOLKSWAGEN'S PARTS DEPARTMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT PURCHASE JUST THE PLASTIC SLIDER (THE DEFECTIVE PART). THIS PART IF SOLD ALONE, COULD NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH MORE THAN $20. INSTEAD, THE WHOLE INTERNAL DOOR PANEL PART MUST BE PURCHASED AT $160. ACCORDING TO THE PARTS DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE, VOLKSWAGEN IS COVERING THIS REPAIR UP TO 40,000 MILES. THUS, I SUBMITTED THE INVOICE FOR THE $160 PART, THE DEFECTIVE SLIDER, AND A LETTER REQUESTING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE PART TO VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA. MY REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT WAS DENIED. FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I WAS NOT IN AN UNSAFE PLACE WHEN THE WINDOW FROZE IN THE DOWN POSITION. CONSIDERING ALL OF THE LISTINGS FOR THIS PROBLEM ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE ALONE, I WOULD HOPE THAT VOLKSWAGEN IS MAKING AN EFFORT TO CHANGE THIS FLAWED DESIGN.

CRUISE CONTROL DISENGAGES WHEN THE RIGHT TURN SIGNAL IS APPLIED. THIS HAPPENED FOR MONTHS UNTI THE CRUISE CONTROL WENT OUT COMPLETELY. I HAVE HEARD THIS FAILURE IS DUE TO A RIBBON CABLE WHICH GETS BROKEN IN THE STEERING COLUMN. MY FIRST ONE BROKE JUST BEFORE THE 24K WARRANTY EXPIRED. THE SECOND ONE BROKE ON SCHEDULE AT ABOUT 50K.

TEN DAYS LATER, ON FEBRUARY 8, 2002 THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED WHILE DRIVING AT A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH ON A SURFACE STREET.  THE ENTIRE TREAD PORTION OF THE TIRE SEPERATED FROM THE SIDEWALLS ( THE TREAD DID NOT SEPERATE FROM THE TIRE - THE ENTIRE 'TOP' OF THE TIRE SEPERATED INTACT FROM THE SIDEWALLS).  ON MONDAY FEBRUARY 11,2002, I RETURNED WITH THE DEFECTIVE TIRE TO WHITTIER TIRE.  THEY IMMEDIATELY BLAMED THE TIRE FAILURE ON THE CAR BEING DRIVEN SEVERAL MILES WITH LITTLE OR NO AIR IN THE TIRE.  THEY REFUSED TO EVEN CONSIDER ANY OTHER CAUSE.  WHILE THERE A CALL WAS PLACED TO BRIDGESTONE WHO TOOK THE SAME POSITION.  THEY DID INSPECT THE TREAD PORTION OF THE TIRE AND COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE OF A PUNCTURE, AND THEY INSPECTED THE VALVE STEM AND CONCLUDED IT WAS OK.  THE STAATED THAT THE TIRE MUST HAVE HAD A SIDEWALL PUNCTURE, BUT THE SIDEWALLS WERE PRETTY \"CHEWED UP\" BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE.   I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CAR WAS DRIVEN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WITH A VERY LOW OR FLAT TIRE.  MY SON WAS DRIVING IT AT THE TIME AND RELATED THAT PRIOR TO THE TIRE FAILURE THE CAR WAS NOT HANDLING IN ANY UNUSUAL MANNER, NOR DID HE HEAR ANY NOISE.
