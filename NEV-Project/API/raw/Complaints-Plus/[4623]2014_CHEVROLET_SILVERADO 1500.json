After googling I saw that a recall exists (NHTSA campaign nr:21T002000) Then I called and sent all my DOT to cooper and they said my tires are the Wall-mart special version which is not included in this recall. So I tried Wall-mart and they are not helping either (no recall exists is always their answer...) My 4 tires are the exact size and produced in the week listet in the recall 21T002000 and show the exact same issues (big bulges in sidewall which are filled with air) just the fact that it is a Discoverer A/T tire not a Discoverer A/T3 4S makes cooper tell me my tires are not in the recall. I believe there are more faulty tires out there and you should look into this since 4 out of 4 tires I have are bad. I am happy to bring my car to you guys to analyse",

Tachometer is bouncing  up and down between 1800-2300 rpm, transmission temp was 270 degrees. Vehicle is having transmission failure. I put transmission in manual mode and used 4th gear at 45 mph to limp into my destination. It was pitch dark, raining and very hard to see and I was concerned of being rear ended if I pulled off the side of the road and waited for a wrecker. The next day I drove the vehicle to a transmission shop, again using M4 to limp in as my brother in law followed behind with his emergency flashers on to alert others of a slow moving vehicle. The independent transmission shop inspected my vehicle and determined the torque converter failed and contaiminated the transmission, lines and cooler with metal shavings. They also commented they see several of these vehicles for the same problem, it's common issue they said. Mileage at failure was 124780. They rebuilt the transmission, replaced the torque converter and flushed the lines and cooler at a cost of 2755.00.  GM should be held responsible to reimburse owners of these vehicles as they knew of these transmission issues and placed the occupants of vehicle at risk of injury or death if  this issue caused a collision.

Other symptoms of the situation include hot temperatures (90+), Radio on, Air Cond. on, Low speed or stopped, voltage seems low. This had happened many many times to me, to the point that one; I could predict when it would happen, such as making a left turn across traffic at an intersection or parking lot, and two; I would not let anyone else drive the vehicle, because it was a safety issue. I have a video of the issue as I was backing into my garage.  Could drive to the store and after a short period in the store attempt to start the vehicle, but the truck acted like it was dead. I would remove the positive cable from the battery for about 10 seconds and put it back and the truck would start. Symptoms of the situation: hot temperatures (90+). This happened several times. I took the truck to Hubler Chevrolet, who told me that a power cable from the battery was defective, but could not tell me what was wrong with it. I declined the work and took it to another mechanic that found that other similar issues have been solved by ensuring that the vehicle is properly grounded to the frame. This solved the issue. Now it is 2021 and I am now losing power steering at low speed turns (parking lot maneuvers, or backing up into my driveway). Temperatures are not a symptom of the issue as it is too late in the year and temps are not that high. The head lights are also blinking when applying the brakes.

I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM SO I HAD THE OBD CHECKED, THAT INDICATED THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAD FAILED.

I PULLED OVER TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS STILL \"OKAY\" TO DRIVE HOME FOR THE NEXT 2 HOURS. I AM VERY LUCKY THAT, THAT DID NOT RESULT INTO A SERIOUS COLLISION. I HAD A FULL TRUCK OF PEOPLE INCLUDING A CHILD ALONG WITH A 4X4 IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK. THIS CONTINUES TO BE AN ON GOING ISSUE WITH THE \"STABILITRACK\" ALERT ALWAYS COMING ON EVERY SECOND. ANOTHER OCCASION I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING LOT WHEN HALF-WAY THROUGH THE ENTRANCE WAY, THE TRUCK SHUT OFF, COMPLETELY. NONE OF THE LIGHTS TURNED ON, THE TRUCK WOULD NOT TURN ON FOR A GOOD 10 MINUTES. I WAS BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT.

IT'S A CLEAR MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY ALL STANDARDS. THE COST OF THEIR VEHICLES BEING SO HIGH, ALL PARTS SHOULD LAST FOR MORE THAN 55000 MILES, INCLUDING THE PAINT.  AGAIN, THIS VEHICLE IS GARAGE KEPT AND LOSES PAINT JUST BY DRIVING WITH A BREEZE OUT.  ASIDE FROM THE 2 PHOTOS ATTACHED, I'M ALSO LOSING PAINT AROUND THE WINDSHIELD AND LOW ON THE DOOR PANELS.",

I HAD THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 5,000 MILES WITH DURABLEND BY AN INDEPENDENT QUICK OIL CHANGE SERVICE, A MILEAGE THAT EXCEEDS THE GM 7,500 MILEAGE RECOMMENDATION.    I EXPLAINED TO GM CEO MARY BARA THAT I WAS UPSET WITH THIS DECISION - A TRUCK WITH 48,000 MILES SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT GM IS NOT ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS QUALITY PROBLEMS.  I FURTHER ADVISED THAT I WOULD SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH OTHERS.  LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO THE BRAKE BOOSTER PUMP HAD TO BE REPLACED - BUT LUCKILY IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  THE TRUCK HAS HAD MULTIPLE RECALLS.    NOW THE GM SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS CHARGING ME $147 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I'M NOT ENGAGING THEM TO DO THE REPAIR.

THE ODD THING IS ONCE I STOPPED AND PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK THE BRAKE PEDAL SEEMED TO BUILD PRESSURE AGAIN AND WAS FINE?  AFTER A LITTLE INVESTIGATION WITH THE VEHICLE I CAN RECREATE THE ISSUE IF I PUMP THE BRAKES 4 TO 5 TIMES IN QUICK SUCCESION WHICH RESULTS AGAIN IN A ROCK HARD PEDAL AND LOSS OF BRAKING. ONCE I REV THE ENGINE IN NEUTRAL I RESTORE PRESSURE BACK TO THE BRAKE PEDAL AND HAVE NO ISSUES. I AM ALMOST POSITIVE THIS IS A BRAKE VACUUM ISSUE AND WILL BE TAKING TO A MECHANIC ASAP TO LOOK INTO IT.",

I HAD TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL TO HELP STOP THE VEHICLE. UPON REVIEWING INTERNET BLOGS OF THIS ISSUE I FOUND OTHERS HERE ON NHTSA WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND ALSO FOUND GM/CHEVY HAD TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS PUBLISHED FOR THIS ISSUE: PIT5361D & PIT5362B. WHAT FAILED WAS THE POWER BRAKE VACUUM PUMP/BOOSTER WHICH PROVIDES THE VACUUM FOR THE BRAKES TO FUNCTION. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO MY CHEVY DEALER FOR REPAIR. THIS BRAKE VACUUM PUMP/BOOSTER REPAIR COST ME $1,100.00 AS THEY SAID IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY NOR WAS A RECALL AT THIS POINT. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WITH SO MANY OTHERS AFFECTED, MYSELF INCLUDED, WITH THIS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THAT IT IS NOT YET A FULL RECALL ITEM. FACT IS, YOU CANNOT DRIVE A VEHICLE WITHOUT WORKING BRAKES, PERIOD.  IT IS NOT A SITUATION SUCH AS BRAKE PADS BEING WORN (THEY ARE NOT), IT IS THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE POWER BRAKE SYSTEM THAT FAILED AND SHOULD BE UNDER A MAJOR RECALL. HERE ARE THE PARTS THAT WERE REPAIRED/REPLACED: BRAKE VACUUM PUMP, VACUUM PUMP BELT, A/C BELT, AND PIPE FROM PUMP TO THE BOOSTER.

WHILE DRIVING IT AROUND A BEND ON A HIGHWAY THE TRUCK SHUT OFF I LOST ALL STEERING THE STEERING LOCKED UP AND I ALMOST CRASHED, THE SERVICE ASSIST LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. THIS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN TURNING. ON 4-13-17 I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO A CHEVY DEALER IT WAS WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM. 8-24-17 I BROUGHT THE TRUCK IN FOR A RECALL #17276 FOR REPROGRAMMING THE POWER STEERING ASSIST CONTROL MODULAR. AFTER THE RECALL THE TRUCK STARTED DOING IT MORE OFTEN THE SAME DAY BUT THE STEERING DID NOT LOCK UP BUT THE TRUCK SHUT OFF WHEN I TRIED MAKING A TURN ON A HIGHWAY. THE SERVICE STEERING ASSIST LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. ON 9-7-17 I BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK TO THE CHEVY DEALER ( CHEVY DEALER NOW CHANGED ITS NAME FROM OASIS TO QUALITY ) COMPLAINING THAT THE RECALL DID NOT WORK. THEY SAID THAT THE RECALL WAS NOT FOR THAT. BUT I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY CHEVY DEALER DROVE THE TRUCK FOR 10 MILES AND IT HAPPENED TO THEM.THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE TIME TO TROUBLE SHOOT THE PROBLEM AND FOUND A LOOSE GROUND WIRE #G218 UNDER THE DASH CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I HAVE DRIVING THE TRUCK FOR 2 DAYS NOW AND IT SEEMS FINE. THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY MADE ME PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY SHOULD HAVE FIXED THE FIRST TIME AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF RECALL # 17276, BECAUSE I BELIEVE PART OF RECALL #17276 HAD TO DO WITH LOW VOLTAGE TO THE STEERING MODULAR. A LOOSE GROUND WILL GIVE YOU LOW VOLTAGE. ANY WAY THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I HAVE READ ONLINE OF OTHERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. PLEASE MAKE A RECALL ABOUT THIS LOOSE GROUND WIRE THAT MAKES THE TRUCK SHUT OFF AND LOSE STEERING BEFORE SOMEONE DIES. THANK YOU",

THEY WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AS GM HAD ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN #PIT5405C ON THIS TYPE OF ISSUE.

THE TRUCK HAD APPROX. 40,000 MILES AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT AND IT SEEMS IT TOOK EITHER TWO YEARS OR THAT REASONABLY LOW MILEAGE BEFORE THE PROBLEM SURFACED. THE DEALER REPAIRED THE PROBLEM BY SIMPLY LOSING A GROUND POST AND TRIMMING OUT THE FABRIC INTRUSION. THEY WERE GREAT AND APOLOGIZED FOR WHAT THEY SAW AS CLEARLY A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING. THEY DID CHARGE AS THE TRUCK WAS OUT OF THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY BUT SAID I SHOULD CONTACT GM CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR HELP WITH THE COST. GM REFUSED BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT $100.00 SO THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE. HOW CAN A COMPANY ALLOW THIS PROBLEM TO EXIST AND BE AWARE OF IT ( TECHNICAL BULLETIN ISSUED).

THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE TURNED OUT MUCH WORSE THAN IT DID...IF YOU OWN ONE OF THESE TRUCKS AND NOTICE A VIBRATION AT ALL, GET IT INTO THE DEALER AND GET IT FIXED IMMEDIATELY, DON'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF HURTING YOUR FAMILY OR SOMEONE ELSE!",

THEN FROM THAT, ONTO IT SAYING NETWORK ERROR.THAT HAPPENS NO MATTER WHAT EVERY TIME I TRY TO USE IT I HAVE TO TURN BLUE TOOTH OFF AND TURN IT BACK ON AND THEN CONNECT IT ALL OVER AGAIN. SOMETIMES I CAN HEAR PEOPLE AND THEY CANT HERE ME. ON 4/08/14 AGAIN I TOOK IT IN THE DEALER FOR THE BLUETOOTH PROBLEM. MY FRONT HEADLAMPS GET MOISTURE IN THEM WHEN I WASH MY TRUCK ON. 3/13/14 THEY REPLACED MY LEFT HEADLAMP, STILL THE MOISTURE HAPPENS.WHEN TURNING ON THE TRUCK FROM PARK AND ENGAGING ON DRIVE A LOUD CLUNK AND A TOUGH MOVEMENT MAKES THE TRUCK FEEL LIKE ITS SWINGING FROM N TO S. AGAIN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER 2/20/14 AND THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG. JANUARY OF 2014 - APRIL 2014 THERE WERE 20 TIMES THAT MY TRUCK WENT INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT 4 TIMES FOR RECALLS THATS 24 TIMES IN 4 MONTHS FOR A NEW TRUCK  I GOT IN AN ACCIDENT ON 4/20/2014 AND 50 PARTS WERE PUT INTO THE TRUCK TO REPAIR IT. IT TOOK THE DEALER SELMAN   3 MONTHS BEFORE I HAD TO CALL AND ASK WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY TRUCK EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE CLUELESS. ON TOP OF ALL THAT I HAD TO DENIED THE TRUCK 8 TIMES BECAUSE OF WRONG PARTS THAT WERE PUT ON. THEY CHANGED MY WHOLE FRONT END . THE LIGHTS TURN ON WHEN THEY WANT, IT SOUND LIKE LOSE PARTS IN SIDE THE DASH.THE TRUCK SHAKES ON FREEWAY GOING 40-60MPH I HAVE THAT ON VIDEO.  I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THE TRUCK. I FEEL THAT I AM BEING DISCRIMINATED  AT SELMAN SINCE THEY TREAT ME DIFFERENT. I WANT SOMEONE TO HELP ME LOOK INTO THIS TRUCK  IT IS UNSAFE FOR MY FAMILY AND WANTED A BUY BACK BUT THEY SAID NO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT OPTION.  *TR",

THE LATEST PROBLEM IS WHAT I AM WRITING TO YOU ABOUT AND I BELIEVE IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND IF IT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE WHO IS NOT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF HANDLING IT, IT COULD EASILY BE FATAL TO ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS.  WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE I DROVE TO THE LOCAL SUPERMARKET TO PICK UP SOME LAST MINUTE STUFF AND AFTER LEAVING THE STORE I PULLED OUT ONTO A BUSY 4 LANE HIGHWAY AND BEGAN TO TURN LEFT.  PART WAY INTO THE TURN I HEARD A ?CLUNK? IN THE FRONT ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY THE POWER STEERING STOPPED WORKING.   THE STEERING WHEEL WAS WRENCHED OUT OF MY HANDS AND I WAS FORCED TO BRAKE SHARPLY.  I WAS, OBVIOUSLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE INCIDENT AND GRABBED THE WHEEL WITH BOTH HANDS AND WRESTLED THE 6,000 LB TRUCK AROUND THE TURN, RUNNING OVER THE CURB ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I AM A REASONABLY FIT 6?4? 225 LB MALE AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT IT WAS ALL THAT I COULD DO TO TURN THE WHEEL AND PREVENT ME FROM RUNNING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION.  MY DEALERSHIP WAS 4 MILES FROM ME AND I WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE MY WAY THERE WITHOUT ANY ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES.    I GOT THE TRUCK THERE AND TOLD THE SERVICE PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID HAVE A SEAT IN THE WAITING ROOM AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT.  25 MINUTES LATER A REP CAME OUT AND SAID IT WAS FIXED.  ANOTHER SOFTWARE ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE.    YESTERDAY, JAN 5 THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED AND THIS TIME I ALMOST HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE.  ONCE AGAIN I WAS CLOSE TO MY DEALER AND WAS ABLE TO DROP THE TRUCK OFF IN THEIR LOT.  THEY ARE CLOSED ON SUNDAY SO I CALLED THEM TODAY AND I AM WAITING FOR THEM TO ?FIX? IT AGAIN.

I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED MANY TIMES BY THIS OPERATOR DISCONNECT ACCELERATING FROM A STATIONARY POSITION.

THE PEDAL TIP-IN ENGAGEMENT HAS TO FLEX THE MOUNTING BRACKET BEFORE THE ELECTRONIC ACCELERATION SWITCH ENGAGES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THE GM ENGINEERING AND DESIGN TEAM'S WOULD APPROVE OF SUCH A FLIMSY MOUNTING BRACKET FOR THIS IMPORTANT PART OF BASIC MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION.

IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO POST SOME VIDEOS TO SHOW THIS VIBRATION PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THERE WAS NO FIX AND THAT THE SEAT WAS WITHIN MANUFACTURES SPECS. THE SEAT MOVED TO THE POINT THAT THE VENTILATED SEAT COOLER PLUG DISCONNECTED. THE SERVICE DEPT EVENTUALLY \"FIXED\" THE SEAT AND RECONNECTED THE PLUG. LASTLY THE ISSUE I CANNOT GET RESOLVED THROUGH GM CORPORATE, DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT OR THE REGIONAL GM MANAGER. MY TRUCK \"SHAKES\" FROM SPEEDS OF 65 MPH AND GREATER. THE SERVICE DEPT FIRST TOLD ME I NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT AND HAVE THE TIRE ROTATED AND BALANCED. THE SHAKE STILL CONTINUED, SO I COMPLAINED AGAIN TO THE SERVICE DEPT. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THAT TWO TIRES WHERE \"BAD\" DO TO ROAD FORCE AND REPLACED THEM. THE TRUCK STILL SHAKES LIKE A STRIPPER SO I EMAILED THE CEO OF GM ON 11 JULY AND ASSIGNED AN EXECUTIVE LIAISON TO WORK THE ISSUE. SINCE THEN MY TRUCK HAS BEEN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TWICE. EACH TIME I WAS CALLED A LIAR INDIRECTLY BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MANAGER \"[XXX]\" AND THE DISTRICT MANAGER \"[XXX]\" AFTER THEY TEST DROVE THE TRUCK AND COULDN'T REPLICATE THE COMPLAINT. I HAD THE SERVICE DEPT FOREMAN \"[XXX]\" RIDE ALONG WITH ME AS I DROVE THE TRUCK AND POINTED OUT THE \"VERY\" NOTICEABLE SHAKE AT HIGH WAY SPEEDS.

I WAS TOLD I AM PROBABLY HITTING IT WITH MY KNUCKLES. I SINCE TRIED ONLY WHILE PINCHING THE KNOB TO AVOID THIS AND THE A/C STILL NEARLY TURNS ON EVERY TIME. ALSO WHEN THE TRUCK SITS A WHILE THE FIRST START IS A HARD ONE BUT AFTER RUNNING AND WARMED UP IT WILL BE FINE TO START. NOT SURE IF THE TRUCK BATTERY NEEDS A CHARGE AFTER SITTING ON THE LOT, I COULD ALSO SMELL A RUBBER BURNING ODOR OUTSIDE AND THROUGH THE VENTS, THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS NEW BUT THEN I SEEN THERE WAS A RECALL 3 DAYS PRIOR.  WHEN I TRIED ANCHORING MY SONS CHILD SEAT I FOUND NO SEAT ANCHORS IN THE CENTER REAR SEAT AND ONLY THE ENDS. I WORRY ABOUT HIS SEAT NEAR THE DOOR IF THERE IS A SIDE CRASH. LASTLY, WHY ISN'T THERE REAR SENSORS AT A MINIMUM A MANDATORY ON TRUCKS YET. CAMERAS CAN STILL BE OFFERED AS A OPTION BUT SENSORS SHOULD BE MANDATORY!   *TR",
