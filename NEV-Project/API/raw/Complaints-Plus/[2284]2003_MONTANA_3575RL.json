AFTER INSPECTION TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE I COULD FIND NOTHING. FURTHER INSPECTION LED ME TO THE UNDER BELLY AND I NOTICED THE SIDE WALL BRACKETS ON THE FRAME HAVE BROKE ON BOTH SIDES.  THEREFORE, THE TRAILER CANNOT BE SAFELY TOWED ANYWHERE.  THE MANUFACTURER RESPECTFULLY DECLINE OUT OF WARRANTY PARTICIPATION.    THIS IS NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE, THIS IS THE WARRANTY OF THE MAIN FRAME IN WHICH THE RV WAS BUILT. THE FRAME SHOULD LAST A LIFE TIME.  THE MODEL NUMBER OF MY RV WAS NOT LISTED. MY RV MODEL IS 3575RL.  *TR",
