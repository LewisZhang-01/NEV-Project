WE TURNED THE CAR ENGINE COMPLETELY OFF AND LET IT REST FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT STARTED AND WE GOT BACK ON THE ROAD AND DROVE DIRECTLY TO A VW SERVICE THAT WAS CLOSEST TO US. THEY SAW \"FAULTS\" OF BEING LOW ON FUEL AND STATED WE SHOULD FILL THE FUEL TANK BEFORE IT GETS TO THE RESERVE AMOUNT.  IT HAS NOT STOPPED SINCE WE IMPLEMENTED THIS INTERVENTION.  HOWEVER THERE WAS AN EARLIER PROBLEM WITH LOSING THE POWER WHILE DRIVING AT FREEWAY SPEEDS THAT WE DID NOT REPORT AS IT SEEMED TO CORRECT ITSELF WITHIN ABOUT 60 SECONDS WHILE DRIVING.    CONCERNS ARE RAISED ON 2 COUNTS: 1.  IS IT REALLY ABOUT FUEL LEVEL, WHEN NO OTHER CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED HAS COMPLETELY STOPPED WHEN LOW ON FUEL (NOT EMPTY, LOW) AND,  2. THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMPLAINT THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED BY OTHERS BEFORE.    THIS MAKES US CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE, SAFETY AND THE RISK OF ACCIDENTS. *TR",

MY PROBLEMS CONSISTED OF SURGING, ROUGH SHIFTS AND A COMPLETE LOSS OF POWER WHEN ATTEMPTING FROM A DEAD STOP.  THIS LATTER CONDITION WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS AS I WOULD BE PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN FOR POWER (FOR INSTANCE, ACCELERATING INTO FAST MOVING TRAFFIC) AND THE POWER WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AND THE CAR WOULD HEDGE AND BALK.  MY VW DEALER HAS SEEN MY CAR 5-6 TIMES NOW FOR REPEATED TRANSMISSION ISSUES.  THEY REPLACED A MECHATRONICS UNIT IN FEBRUARY 2008.  THEN THEY REPLACED THE DUAL CLUTCH PACKS LATER THAT YEAR.  THIS YEAR THEY REPLACED THE MECHATRONICS UNIT AGAIN WHEN THEY DETERMINED THAT THE FIRST REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS FROM A MANUFACTURING RUN OF UNITS THAT WERE KNOWN TO BE FAULTY.  I'D SAY THAT AFTER THIS RECENT FIX THE TRANSMISSION IS ABOUT 95% OF NORMAL.  I STILL EXPERIENCE AWKWARD SHIFTS FROM TIME TO TIME.  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS WERE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE BECAUSE THEY WERE OFTEN INTERMITTENT AND THERE WERE NO COMPUTER FAULT CODES RECORDED BY THE CAR'S DIAGNOSTICS.  IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MY VW DEALER THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED AND REMEDIED.  AS IT HAPPENED, THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITION (THE DRAMATIC MOMENTARY LOSS OF POWER WHEN ACCELERATING HARD) WAS DETERMINED TO NOT BE A RESULT OF THE TRANSMISSION BUT FROM A FAULTY BRAKE SWITCH.  THIS SWITCH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE TRANSMISSION BY NOT ALLOWING THE TRANSMISSION TO BE REVVED TOO HIGH WHEN THE BRAKES WERE STILL ON.  THE SWITCH ON MY CAR WAS DELAYED IN TELLING THE COMPUTER ON MY CAR THAT I HAD TAKEN MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND WANTED POWER.

THE RETRACTABLE TOP ALSO LEAKS AND DRIPS CAUSING DISTRACTION DURING EPISODES OF DRIVING IN THE RAIN.  IT HAS BEEN IN FOR SERVICE FOR THESE ITEMS AND SEVERAL OTHERS UP TO 5 TIMES.  THE SERVICE WRITER (MATT) AT THE DEALERSHIP (SIERRA MOTORS IN OTTAWA IL 815-434-3240) CLAIMS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SOFTWARE FOR THE WINDOWS AND VW IS RESEARCHING THE ISSUES AND MUST CREATE BETTER PROGRAMMING.  NOW THE RADIO HAS BEGUN TO FADE IN AND OUT.  SEEMS LIKE THE CAR HAS MANY ELECTRICAL ISSUES.  I HAVE CONTACTED VW DIRECTLY (800-822-8987) AND BEEN ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER OF 90002357 WITH A REGIONAL CASE MGR PETE NARADONI.  PETE WAS NOT AWARE OF A SOFTWARE ISSUE WITH THE PROGRAMMING OF THE CAR WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE IS NOT BEING HONEST WITH ME.  VW NOR THE DEALERSHIP HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE AND I FEEL I NEED AN ADVOCATE TO GET RESULTS.  AS OF TODAY THEY HAVE HAD MY CAR FOR 9 DAYS!!!!  THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE OTHER TIMES THEY HAVE HAD IT FOR THESE SAME ISSUES.  I FEEL THAT THEY ARE IN BREECH OF WARRANTY. *TR",

I PUT MY HAND UNDERNEATH THE TRUNK LID IN ORDER TO LIFT AND TRY AGAIN. BEFORE I COULD LIFT, THE TRUNK HYDRAULIC-LY CLOSED DOWN TIGHTLY ON MY FINGERS.  MY HAND WAS CLAMPED, IMMOVABLE.  LUCKILY IN MY OTHER HAND I HAD THE KEYS, AND WAS ABLE TO UNLOCK THE TRUNK, BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS EXCRUCIATING.  I BELIEVE THIS MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MECHANICS OF THE HARD TOP CONVERTIBLE WHICH LOWERS INTO THE TRUNK.  WHILE THIS MAY BE A GOOD WAY TO TRAP A BURGLAR WHO THINKS THE TRUNK IS OPEN, IT IS VERY DANGEROUS, AND ESPECIALLY IF A SMALL CHILD HAPPENED TO PUT THEIR FINGERS NEAR IT.  THIS CAUSED DEEP INDENTATION MARKS ON THE TOPS AND BOTTOMS OF MY FINGERS, WRIST THROBBING AND NUMBNESS/PRICKLING IN MY FINGERS.  *TR",
