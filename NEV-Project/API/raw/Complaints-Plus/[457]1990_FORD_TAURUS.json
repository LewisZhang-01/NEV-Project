THE CONTROL ARM ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE IS  ABOUT  5MM FROM THE ABS RING. I WENT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AND HAD THEM GET ME 2 NEW CONTROL ARMS L+R. GUESS WHAT THEY WERE DIFFERENT THEN THE ONES THAT UNITED AUTO SOLD ME. I WENT BACK TO UNITED AUTO, HAD AN EMPLOYEE PULL CONTROL ARMS FOR A TAURUS AND TAURUS SHO. THE CONTROL ARMS WERE THE SAME THING. TRW  IS PACKAGING NON-SHO CONTROL ARMS AS SHO ONES. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONSIDERING A SHO IS A HIGH PERFORMANCE CAR (220HP) COMPARED TO (140HP) REGULAR TAURUS. I SPOKE WITH A LOCAL REP FOR TRW , EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS. I AM GOING TO LEAVE FEEDBACK ON THIS TOPIC ON THE SHO CLUB WEBSITE, I AM SURE THAT OTHER SHO OWNER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THERE GETTING THE WRONG PART , AND IT WILL FAIL IF INSTALLED ON A SHO. I ENDED UP PUTTING 2 KNEW CONTROL ARMS ON MY CAR, THE DEALERSHIP WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE CORRECT PART. THANK YOU, HOPE TO HERE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SOON. *AK  *TR",

MY HUSBAND AND I HAD SPENT $4000 FOR CAR REPAIRS IN 1998-ON 2/23 WATERPUMP REPLACEMENT, INSPECTION OF FUEL SYSTEM HOSES AND TUBES, ON 3/18 FUEL PUMP REPLACEMENT,  6/12 NEW PFE SENSOR, 8/13 REPLACEMENT ALTERNATOR AND REGULATOR,COOLING FAN AND FUSIBLE LINK , 8/14 REPLACED ALTERNATOR AND INTERGRATED CONTROL MODULE, 11/11 OIL CHANGE AND MULTIPOINT INSPECTION AND ON 11/20/98 ANOTHER OIL CHANGE AS WELL AS GASKETS, SEALS, HOSES THERMOSTAT ON THIS DATE.  SHEEHY FORD REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR PART OF THE MONIES SPENT ON 11/20 OR PROVIDE FREE WORK ON OUR OTHER CAR A FORD EXPLORER IN LIEU OF CASH.  I CONTACTED MONTGOMERY  COUNTY DIVISION OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, AND THEN, THE STATE OF MARYLAND CONSUMER PROTECTION DIVISION.  SHEEHY FORD REFUSED TO ARBITRATE AND NEITHER DIVISION COULD PROVE SHEEHY WAS AT FAULT.  I HAD INITIALLY CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS REFERRED TO MY DEALER.  AFTER DEALING WITH THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICES , I WROTE A LETTER TO JAC NASSER, CEO OF FORD.  ABOUT 6 WEEKS LATER IN MARCH 1999,  I DID GET A CALL FROM A FORD REP WHO REFUSED COMPENSATION BECAUSE I HAD DONATED THE CAR JANUARY 31, 1999 SINCE IT WAS NOT DRIVEABLE. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO AUTOMATION INC. ON 1/25/99 AND WAS TOLD THE CAR NEEDED NO LESS THAN A CRANK KIT, ESTIMATE $12-15,000.

THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE MOUNTS SHOULD BE REPLACED AND WOULD COST ME $343.70. A FEW YEARS AGO, I HAD NOTICED THE MOVEMENT IN THE ENGINE WHEN THE CAR WAS SHIFTED INTO PARK OR REVERSE, AND HAD ASKED MY LOCAL GARAGE MECHANIC ABOUT IT. HE TOLD ME THE MOUNTS ON THE TAURUS WERE NOTORIOUSLY BAD, BUT MY PARTICULAR CAR WAS NOT COVERED BY A FORD RECALL. I DID NOT PURSUE REPLACING THE MOUNTS AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, NOW THAT THIS RECALL NOTICE ON THE FRAME CAME OUT, I HAVE LOOKED AT MATERIAL AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET, AND SEE THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL RECALLFOR ENGINE MOUNT DETERIORATION ON THIS CAR IN MARCH 92. (92M77) I DO NOT THINK I RECEIVED A NOTICE OF THAT RECALL. SINCE I DRIVE MY 3 KIDS AROUND IN THIS CAR, I TRY TO KEEP IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND DETERIORATING ENGINE MOUNTS IS A RECALL NOTICE I WOULD HAVE PURUSED. IN ANY EVENT, I CALLED THE DEALER (CENTURY FORD IN ROCKVILLE, MD) TODAY ASKING ABOUT THE ENGINE MOUNT DETERIORATION RECALL AND WHETHER THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FRONT AND REAR ENGINE MOUNTS SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN CARE OF AT NO COST TO ME. THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE PARAMETERS OF THAT RECALL WERE IN EFFECT ONLY FOR 60,000 MILES OR 6 YEARS. THEY SAID MY CURRENT MILEAGE, ABOUT 69,000, PUTS MY CAR OUTSIDE THAT LIMIT AND THEREFORE FORD WOULD NOT PAY THEM TO DO THAT WORK. (I.E. I MUST PAY.) I HAVE SINCE CALLED FORD AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THIS SITUATION AND THEY JUST SAID THEY'D DO NOTHING. I THINK THE DETERIORATION OF THE ENGINE MOUNTS SOUNDS LIKE A WELL-KNOWN (TO FORD, ANYWAY) PROBLEM ON THIS CAR AND SEEMS STRUCTURALLY TO BE INTRINSICALLY RELATED TO THIS OTHER RECALL ON THE SUB FRAME, AND POSSIBLY CAUSED BY IT.",

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE MOTOR MOUNTS HAVE FAILED FOUR TIMES SINCE WE HAVE OWNED THIS CAR.FORD HAS REPLACED THESE MOUNTS 3TIMES UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE FOURTH TIME I PAID $356.00 FOR THEIR REPLACEMENT.NOW ONCE MORE I AM HEARING THAT FAMILAR CLUNK WHICH MEANS THAT THE MOTOR MOUNTS NEED REPLACEMENT AGAIN.THESE MOUNTS HAVE FAILED SINCE 12/29/93, 5/20/94, 7/17/95, AND  O5/8/97. FORD REPLACED THE MOUNTS THE FIRST THREE TIMES UNDER WARRANTY,THE FORTH TIME I HAD TO HAVE THEM REPAIRED,IT COST $356. I CALLED FORD ABOUT THIS PRBBLEM,AND ASK IF THIS SHOULD BE STILL BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE THIS IS A REOCCURRING PROBLEM AND I WAS TOLD NO. HOPEFULLY,THIS PROBLEM CAN BE RESOLVED.
