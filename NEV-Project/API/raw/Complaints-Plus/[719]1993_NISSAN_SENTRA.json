ANOTHER PROBLEM IT HAS IS WHEN I WENT TO USE THE CRUISE CONTROL, SPRINGS FLEW OUT OF IT. I HAD NEVER USED IT BEFORE. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE AXLES, CV JOINTS AND STEERING KIT. EVERYTHING WENT OUT ON MY CAR. ONE LEAD TO THE NEXT. I CAN'T REALIGN MY CAR BECAUSE MY STEERING KIT AND TIE RODS ARE SHOT ALONG WITH MY AXLES AND CV JOINTS. BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE MY TIRES TWICE FROM THEM WEARING DOWN. I WOULD FIX IT BUT WHEN I GOT IT ALL PRICED, IT WAS ALMOST $2000. I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. *JB",
