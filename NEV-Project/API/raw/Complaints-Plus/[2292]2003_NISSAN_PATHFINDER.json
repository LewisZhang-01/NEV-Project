THERE WAS BACK AND FORTH CONTACT BY PHONE AND E-MAIL WITH DEALERSHIP. I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE SHIPPING COSTS AND LATER PROVIDED DETAILS ON STEPS AND COSTS TO HAVE THE VEHICLE WRECKED HERE IN TOWN. SOMETIME TOWARD END OF JUNE 2013 I STOPPED GETTING UPDATES. NISSAN CORP ISSUED A 2ND CASE NUMBER ON 7/15 THEY HAVE CALLED EVERY FEW DAYS TO SAY NO NEWS.  7/26/13 I GOT A CALL SAYING DECISION IS I NEED TO BRING DEALERSHIP. THEY ARE TO CALL BACK 7/29 TO TELL ME IF I CAN GET THAT IN WRITING. NISSAN HAS BEEN PROVIDED 3 SETS OF PHOTOS THAT CLEARLY SHOW THROUGH HOLES IN STRUT HOUSING. THIS CAR IS NOT FIT TO DRIVE THE DISTANCES OR SPEEDS THEY ARE ASKING. NISSAN HAS ALLOWED THIS VEHICLE STAY ON THE ROADS SINCE APRIL EVEN AFTER THEY WERE PROVIDED WITH EVIDENCE THAT CAR IS COMPROMISED AND DANGEROUS. NISSAN CORP. IS ALLOWING KNOWN DANGEROUS VEHICLES TO REMAIN ON ROADS IN RURAL AREAS PLACING PEOPLE LIKE ME IN DANGER BECAUSE IT IS COST AND TIME PROHIBITIVE FOR OWNERS LIKE ME TO GET TO A DEALERSHIP.

THERE WAS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ,NHTSA ITEM  10010378/SERVICE BULLETIN  04092; DATE OF BULLETIN 9/1/2004  FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT SHE WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A RECALL. SHE PURCHASED A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR, AND IT WAS LETTING HER KNOW THAT THERE WAS CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE VEHICLE WHILE SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD HER THEY CORRECTED THE  EXHAUST PROBLEM  FREE OF CHARGE. THE DEALERSHIP  SHOW THE CONTACT THAT THERE WAS A 2001 NISSAN PATHFINDER THAT WAS IN FOR SERVICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM BECAME MORE INTENSE SINCE APRIL  2005. THE SERVICE INVOICE FROM THE DEALERSHIP STATED: CONCERN WHEN IN NEUTRAL AND COLD THERE IS A TICKING NOISE IN LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE, AND THERE IS A CARBON MONOXIDE SMELL IN THE VEHICLE, CARBON MONOXIDE FOUND LEAK AT HEATER PIPE. THE CONTACT STATED SHE CLAIMED SYMPTOMS OF CARBON MONOXIDE BUT SHE COULD NOT SMELL IT BECAUSE CARBON MONOXIDE IS ODORLESS SO THAT STATEMENT IN THE SERVICE INVOICE WAS INCORRECT. *AK",

I WANT TO GET RID OF THIS VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY HAS 2000 MILES ON IT.  IF I GET ANOTHER VEHICLE, HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM SINCE ANOTHER OPERATOR MAY EXPERIENCE SAME SITUATION WITH THIS VEHICLE RESULTING IN INJURY OR DEATH.",
