This could catch on fire causing damage to the motorcycle not to mention my wife and I could be severely burned. They continue to say that they do not have the part and as of September 2021 still do not have the part and as of today they still do not have the part to put in. This is very inconvenient and that I cannot ride my motorcycle for fear of injury. There are no warning lamps if it is leaking and the dealer keeps telling me he does not have the part. They can\u2019t get a fuel pump but they continue to make new motorcycles all the time.  That does not make sense. They sold the motorcycle and they should be able to make all parts available. March 1 it will be one year since I have been notified.",
