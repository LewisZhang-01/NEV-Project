ABOUT AN HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES LATER, I WAS AWAKEN BY A POPPING SOUND AND THE DOG BARKING. I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW TO FIND THE CAR'S ENGINE COMPARTMENT FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. I THEN CALLED 911 AND RAN OUT TO TRY TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE WITH A GARDEN HOSE. THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE BURNED THROUGH THE HOOD ON THE DRIVERS SIDE IN THE AREA OF THE BRAKING SYSTEMS MASTER CILINDER, THEN IGNITED THE DRIVERS SIDE TIRE AND ALL PLASTIC COMPONENTS RENDERING THE HOSE  INEFECTIVE. BY THE TIME THE FIRE TRUCK ARRIVED, THE FLAMES HAD SPREAD TO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR AND A MASSIVE PLASTIC / RUBBER FIRE ENSUED.THE FIREMEN DOUSED IT WITH WATER FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN USED A FOAMING AGENT TO EXTINGUISH WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE VEHICLE. AFTER INSPECTING THE REMAINS, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE FIRE STARTED IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT BECAUSE THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR WAS MOSTLY INTACT.    I HAD OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAD IT MAINTAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE ONLY MAJOR REPAIR PERFORMED ON THE CAR WAS REPLACING A DEFECTIVE INTAKE MANIFOLD (THAT TOO SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED, DUE TO THE HIGH NUMBER OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING THAT PERTICULAR MANIFOLD DESIGN).         AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN SEVERAL MODELS MADE BY THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY. TO RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM GO TO WWW.VEHICLE-INJURIES.COM AND LOOK UNDER \"FORD EXPEDITION CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH FIRES\".",

WEBSITE IS  WWW.NHTSA.GOV  PROBLEM DETAILS:  RECENTLY I RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE FOR WORK FOR $899.14 TO FIX A CRACKED  MANIFOLD ALONG WITH GASKETS, AND SEALS ON MY 1997 FORD CROWN VICTORIA, THAT  I PURCHASED FROM A USED CAR DEALERSHIP IN BALTIMORE, MD IN 2003.

WHEN THIS BREAKDOWN OCCURRED I CONTACTED THE COMPANY WHERE I PURCHASED MY EXTENDED  WARRANTY FROM IN SEPTEMBER OF 2005. THE CLAIM WAS DENIED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT COVER ITEMS THAT WERE RECALLED. I WAS THEN DIRECTED BY THE WARRANTY COMPANY TO CALL FORD COMPANY DIRECTLY, I FOLLOWED UP AND MADE THE CALL TO FIND THAT THE MANIFOLD THAT WAS RECALLED HAD A SEVEN YEAR WARRANTY FROM FORD COMPANY THAT HAD EXPIRED.   I AM NOW STUCK WITH AN $899.14 BILL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE FOR SOMETHING I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT UNTIL IT OCCURRED. I FEEL THAT BEFORE SELLING ME THE VEHICLE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AND TAKEN CARE OF BY THE DEALERSHIP BRUNS MOTORS.

HOWEVER, IT IS DEEMED A SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN BY THE AGENCY. FORD IS INITIATING AN OWNER NOTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR OWNERS OF CERTAIN 1995-1997 CROWN VICTORIA MODEL VEHICLES WITH POLICE, TAXI, AND COMMERCIAL FLEET PACKAGES AND TOWN CAR VEHICLES WITH THE LIVERY PACKAGE. THESE VEHICLES MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE BRAKE LINE AND THE UNDERBODY FRONT FLOOR PAN ASSEMBLY WHICH COULD CAUSE WEAR OF THE BRAKE LINES. CONSEQUENCE: THIS COULD LEAD TO BRAKE FLUID LOSS FOR THE REAR BRAKES AND, POTENTIALLY, INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCES. REMEDY: DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BRAKE LINES FOR WEAR, INSTALL TWO NEW TUBE BUNDLE CLIPS, AND CHECK THE BRAKE LINES FOR PROPER CLEARANCES. IF THE BRAKE LINES ARE WORN, THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE BRAKE LINE WILL BE REPLACED.

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE .

IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND .
