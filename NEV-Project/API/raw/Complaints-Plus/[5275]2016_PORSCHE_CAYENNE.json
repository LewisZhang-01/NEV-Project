Some times tail light works and  does not when car is in cold weather Was told that both tail lights were defective and would have to be replaced at a cost of $3400.00 .  Found  an after sale Porsche publication saying that it affected 2015-2018 Porsche Cayenne.  Dealer told me that it is no longer covered since my warranty is not in effect anymore.  However this is a safety issue not a warranty issue.  Have paperwork stating that Porsche knows the tail lights are defective.  Since I live in Florida they have been working fine.
