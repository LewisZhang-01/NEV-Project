I learned that they were related after I reached out to Nissan regarding my vehicle not starting, it first happened on New Years Eve. This has now happened 2-3X a week. In addition to this issue, I\u2019ve experienced issues with the CVT, and possibly the engine. One evening I was heading home after work, I got onto the on ramp, and attempted to accelerate to merge onto I-84. The vehicle would not accelerate beyond 45, the engine would rev extremely high, and not go any faster. I pulled onto the shoulder as best and quickly as I could. I turned the car off then back on, attempted to merge onto I-84, and had to get onto the shoulder again because I wasn\u2019t able to go faster than 45MPH. Both times I was almost sideswiped by an 18 wheeler on the driver side, had that happened I\u2019d have lost my life. I sat there very frustrated, and in shock. After a few minutes of having no traffic, I drove home at 45MPH.   I\u2019ve reached out to Nissan regarding the aforementioned issues, asking if they\u2019d buy the vehicle back for what I owe on it. I received a letter from Nissan Consumer Affairs basically refusing to buy the car back. It\u2019s exasperating owning a 2019 with 15,100 miles, and experiencing these issues. I\u2019m by no means the type of person that feels a brand new vehicle is more reliable than an older one. I\u2019m the type of person that likes knowing I can rely on my car. My mothers\u2019 2003 Outback with over 230K has been far more reliable than my Sentra. Knowing that there\u2019s no remedy to repair the stop lamp recall is frustrating, that means that each time I go to start my car it may not start, on days that it hasn\u2019t, I\u2019ve spent 10 minutes trying trying to get it to start.

People drove past me honked, called me names, and finally one  person helped me move it out of the road. While on the side of the road the car again was on but when I pressed on gas would not accelerate, however while the brake and emergency brake were on and the car  was in park it rolled backwards.

Someone ran a redlight and I need to move quickly to avoid an accident. The vehicle sputtered and when it caught it's gear, almost lurched me into oncoming traffic. Nissan has placed 7 transmissions in my car and all are the same. I never took their replacement car because when I drove two other of the same models of my car. They did the same thing! Nissan needs to be held accountable and find a way to fix the transmission so it does not do this shudder anymore. I've seen many consumer reviews that state the same problem. I feel this is widespread enough and a big enough safety defect that Nissan needs to fix before it kills someone because they can move out of the way in time.",

WE WERE RUNNING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 55 MPH WHEN THE CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AT RANDOM. NO WRECK OR ACCIDENT OF ANY KIND. MY LEFT EAR DRUM WAS BUSTED AND  MY DAUGHTER WAS MASSIVELY BRUISED. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ISSUED A RENTAL. 5 DAYS LATER THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME THE RENTAL HAD TO BE RETURNED AND NISSAN WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF ANY KIND. I CALLED CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO SEE WHY THE RENTAL WAS BEING TAKEN BACK. I WAS INFORMED RUDELY THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HELPING IN ANY WAY AND AIRBAGS WERE A COMPLEX MACHINE THAT DID NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT CAUSE.  AND THEN WENT ON TO ACCUSE ME OF FRAUD. THE CAR FINALLY GOT INSPECTED AT NISSAN OF COOKEVILLE BY A CONSUMER INSPECTOR WHO STOOD WITH ME AND CONFIRMED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT WRECKED AND THE MALFUNCTION WAS NOT MY FAULT. I JUST TODAY HEARD BACK FROM CONSUMER AFFAIRS TODAY FOR THEM TO TELL ME THAT NISSAN WOULD NOT BE HELPING ME IN ANY WAY.
