THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY MY PATHFINDER'S GAS PEDAL FAILURE WHICH CAUSED IT TO STAY AT THE PRESSED DOWN POSITION WHILE GOING AT ABOUT 30MPH, AND I WAS UNABLE TO BRAKE, THUS HITTING THE OTHER 5 CARS. THANKS TO THE PRESENCE OF THESE CARS, MY PATHFINDER WAS ABLE TO STOP AND MY SAFETY SPARED.      WHEN I FILED THE CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY GEICO (POLICY #[XXX] ), I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY MY RECKLESSNESS OR LACK OF EXPERIENCE, BUT INSTEAD, IT WAS DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE. THE CLAIM #S RELATED TO THE INCIDENTS ARE: [XXX]  AND [XXX] . DESPITE OF THAT, MY INSURANCE PREMIUM NEARLY DOUBLED.

I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT IT IS THE EVAP VENT CONTROL VALVE AND O RING WHICH NEED TO BE REPLACED. I HAD TAKEN THE CAR INTO 3 DEALERSHIPS ON THE EAST COAST WHERE I WAS TOLD NUMEROUS OTHER ISSUES WERE CAUSING THE LIGHT. I HAVE PUT $4500 WORTH OF WORK INTO THE VEHICLE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS A $122 PART THAT SUPPOSEDLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER NISSAN OWNERS (MANY WITH OTHER NISSAN VEHICLES-NOT PATHFINDERS) AND THEY TOO HAVE HAD THIS SAME EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR VEHICLE. THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH ANYBODY EXCEPT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIPS WHICH MEANS THERE IS NO WAY TO GET A COMPETATIVE PRICE. IN ORDER TO GET THE LIGHT TO SHUT OFF ONCE MY MECHANIC HAS REPLACED THE PARTS I WILL THEN BE FORCED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO PAY THEM TO SHUT IT OFF. I WAS INFORMED BY THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT EFFECT THE DRIVABILITY OF THE VEHICLE THAT IT WAS AN EMISSIONS SITUATION. ULTIMATELY, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT PASS EMISSIONS INSPECTIONS NOR WILL IT GET DECENT GAS MILEAGE UNTIL THIS PART IS REPLACED.",

THE CAR HAD UNUSUAL, UNCONTROLLABLE, AND VERY DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR WITHOUT ANY WARNING.   THIS SITUATION WAS SO BAD THAT IT ALMOST COLLIDED WITH A FEW OTHER CARS AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS.EVENTS:(1) WHILE ENTERING HIGHWAY RAMP, GRADUALLY ACCELERATING (WITH SPEED AROUND 30 TO 35 MPH), THE ENGINE HESITATES.     ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY ROARED AND ACCELERATED BY ITSELF WITH THE CAR QUICKLY GAINED SPEED ABOVE 55MPH - WITHOUT APPLYING ANY GAS PADDLE.   NO CRUISE CONTROL WAS USED OR TURNED ON.   THE DRIVER TRIED TO APPLY SERVICE-BRAKE BUT THE BRAKE WAS VERY STIFF WITHOUT ANY RESPONSE EVEN WITH EXTRA EFFORT.   THE DRIVER NOTICED THE ENGINE WAS AT 6000RPM.(2) THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO SHIFT THE GEAR TO NEUTRAL.   THOUGH THE SHIFT-LEVER-POSITION DID ENTER THE \"NEUTRAL\" INDICATION, THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM STILL STAYED AT THE \"DRIVE\" AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE AND GAINING SPEED.   (THE DRIVER CONTINUED TO USE SERVICE-BRAKE ALL THE TIME TO NO AVAIL.)(3) THE DRIVER TRIED TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN BY SHIFTING TO A LOWER GEAR (\"2\"), THE CAR SPEED SLOWED DOWN VERY GRADUALLY.   AT THAT TIME, THE DRIVER APPLIED EMERGENCY HAND-BRAKE.(4) EVENTUALLY THE CAR STOPPED USING THE HAND-BRAKE.   RIGHT AFTER THIS, THE DRIVER SHIFTED THE LEVER TO \"PARK\" THEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY (AND IMMEDIATELY) SHOT UP TO 6000RPM AGAIN - AND THE TRANSMISSION APPEARED TO RE-ENGAGE AND MOVED THE CAR FORWARD  WITH A VERY LOUD NOISE.   THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TURNED-OFF THE IGNITION TO STOP THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A NISSAN DEALER.  *AK",

I SPENT OVER 8 HOURS IN THE DEALERSHIP TRYING TO GET MY ORIGINAL CAR (VW JETTA) BACK SO I COULD JUST LEAVE AND NOT GET THE PATHFINDER I HAD TEST DRIVEN.  THE DEALERSHIP, SALESMAN, HAD MY KEYS AND KEPT THEM FROM ME AND CONTINUED TO WORK A DEAL SO THAT HE COULD GET ME INTO THE NEW PAHTFINDER.  I TOLD HIM, SEVERAL TIMES, THAT I JUST WANTED TO GET MY KEYS AND GO.  I HAD NO INTENTION OF PURCHASING A CAR THAT DAY, ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS TEST DRIVE A FEW CARS AND CHECK OUT ALL MY OPTIONS.  HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT HAPPEN, AS I SAID THEY CONTINUED TO KEEP ME THERE FOR 8+HOURS.  WHEN THEY FINALLY PULLED MY NEW PATHFINDER AROUND, IT WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL CAR I HAD TEST DRIVEN AND I WAS THROUGHLY UPSET.  IT WAS LATE AND I WAS TIRED, MY BOYFRIEND AND HIS SON MET ME THERE. I TOLD THEM I WAS BEAT AND NEEDED TO GO HOME.  SO WE LEFT AND DECIDED I WOULD GO BACK ON MONDAY MORNING,UTILIZED MY OPTION OF RETURNING THEIR CAR WITH IN 2 BUSINESS DAYS AND GETTING MINE BACK WITH NO OBLIGATIONS.

I THEN POINTED OUT TO THEM THAT AFTER BEING IN THEIR SHOWROOM FOR OVER 8 HOURS, I WAS GOING THROUGH ALL KINDS OF PAPER WORK AND SIGNING WHERE I WAS TOLD TO SIGN, NEXT TO OR ON THE YELLOW HIGHLIGHTED MARKS.  THE OPTION OF WAIVING MY RIGHT TO RETURN THE CAR WAS ONLY HIGHLIGHTED IN ONE SPOT, THAT WAS TO WAIVE MY RIGHT, INSTEAD OF BEING HIGHLIGHTED IN BOTH SPOTS, GIVING MY THE OPTION TO RETURN OR DENY.
