I KNOW THIS IS NOT A SPORTS CAR BUT WOULD LIKE TO DRIVE CONFIDENTLY TO WORK WITHOUT THE WORRY OF GETTING IN AN ACCIDENT. EVERY TIME I ACCELERATE NOW, THE RPM'S RAISE TO 1,500-2,000 RPM BEFORE THE CVT STARTER CLUTCH ENGAGES AND JERKS THE CAR FORWARD. THERE IS ALSO A WHINE COMING FROM THE CVT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE CAR HAS 62,000 MILES CURRENTLY WHICH IS NOT A LOT. I JUST HAD HIGHER STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FROM SUCH A REPUTABLE CAR MANUFACTURER.
