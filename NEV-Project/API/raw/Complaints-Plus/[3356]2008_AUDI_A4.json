WHILE DRIVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY THE TRANSMISSION CHANGES FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL BY ITSELF THUS LOSING CONTROL OF THE SPEED AND MOTION OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM PRODUCED A RECALL FOR THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE SAME AUDI VEHICLE'S 2002 - 2006 MODELS.  UPON CALLING VOLKSWAGEN AUDI, UP TO THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, I WAS TOLD THAT WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS TESTED BY MY AUDI DEALER THAT THE \"CODE\" WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS RECALL.  CODE? THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE SAME AS THE RECALL AND THEY TELL ME THE CODE IS DIFFERENT.  THE CODE COULD BE CHANGED LIKE A \"PASSWORD\" COULD BE CHANGED.  THE SYMPTOM APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AS SEVERAL AUTO SHOPS TOLD ME THIS AND THE AUDI DEALER ITSELF SAID THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM.  MY AUDI ONLY HAS 72500 MILES ON IT AND THIS ELECTRONIC MODULE, TCM AND RELAY WHICH ARE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION HOUSING ARE THE BLAME TO THIS PROBLEM. MY FEELING IS THAT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, SHOULD IT OCCUR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND THE TRANSMISSION GOES INTO NEUTRAL BY ITSELF THIS COULD BE POSSIBLY DEADLY TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE OR OTHER VEHICLES AROUND IT.  HOW COULD AUDI BE SO BLATANTLY ABLE TO IGNORE THIS?  I HAD MY AUDI REPAIRED AT THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY USED AN \"UPDATED\" TCM MODULE.  THIS UPDATING ONLY SHOWS THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND DO NOT HAVE A RECALL FOR THE VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM AS THEY DID FOR THE 2002 - 2006 MODELS!!!  ARE THEY WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE THEY STEP UP AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT SUCH AN OCCURRENCE?

IN ADDITION, THEY CANNOT OFFER A LOANER CAR SINCE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THEY WILL HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX IT AND WON'T COMMIT TO OFFERING A LOANER INDEFINITELY.

ON NJ TURNPIKE AT HIGH SPEED HAD SUDDEN BLOW OUT..WHICH WAS RESULTED FROM SIDEWALL PUNCTURE..AND AGAIN ENDED UP WITH FLAT TIRE AND A BUBBLE ON THE OTHERS.. I'VE NOTICED THE SAME PATTERN HERE FIRST YOU GET BUBBLE EASILY FROM NORMAL TYPE OF DRIVING GOING OVER LITTLE BUMPY OR ROUGH ROADS.. THEN ALL THE SUDDEN THAT BUBBLE BLOWS OUT, END UP GETTING THE BLOW OUT OR A PUNCTURE.. I CONTACTED PIRELLI TIRES SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY DENIED ON DEFECTIVE TIRE ON THIS SPECIFIC MODEL.. THEY SAID THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BLOW OUTS CAUSE FROM ROAD HAZARDS.. WHEN THE TIRE IT SELF ARE DEFECTIVE IN A WAY.. THEY SHOULD REALLY RECALL THIS TIRE OR GET THEM OFF THE MARKET BEFORE SOMEONE REALLY GETS HURT OR KILLED... THANK GOD I AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT BUT IT WAS REAL DANGEROUS.. IT COULD BE YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY MEMBER..  I FIND PIRELLI TIRES HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE ON THIS MATTER. AND AUDI AMERICA AND NHTSA SHOULD DEAL WITH THEM. *TR",
