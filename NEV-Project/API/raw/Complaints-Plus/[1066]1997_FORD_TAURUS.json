AFTER I PARKED MY CAR AT THE HOTEL IT WAS AN HOUR LATER WHEN I HEARD A LOUD POP AND THEN A HISSING NOISE. THE NEXT DAY I WENT DOWN TO MY CAR. IT WAS AT THAT TIME I NOTICED MY CAR WAS SUNK DOWN. I WENT TO CHANGE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A FLAT TIRE AND AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS STUCK INTO THE SIDE OF IT. THE COIL SPRING SURROUNDING THE STRUT BROKE AND PUNCTURED THE TIRE MAKING IT GO FLAT INSTANTLY. I SPOKE TO TWO PEOPLE THAT MORNING THAT WERE STANDING OUTSIDE AND WITNESSED IT THE NIGHT BEFORE. THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. IT WAS NOT BEING DRIVEN.    MY CONCERN IN THIS MATTER IS THAT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY. WHAT IF I HAD DRIVEN ANOTHER HOUR?  I FEAR IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ME TO VEER OFF INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. MY TIRE WENT FLAT INSTANTLY AND IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY AND POSSIBLE DEATH.       I SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING CALLING REPAIR SHOPS. I FIRST BECAME VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHEN I CALLED THE FIRST REPAIRMAN AND HE KNEW EXACTLY THE PROBLEM I HAD. HE SAID HE FIXES THIS PROBLEM ON FORD TAURUS' BETWEEN TWO OR THREE TIMES A MONTH. AFTER THIS I PROCEEDED TO CALL A FORD DEALERSHIP EXPECTING A RECALL. THE GENTLEMAN KNEW NOTHING OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE FORD TAURUS. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS ON OLDER AND NEWER MODELS OF THE TAURUS WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND OWN A 2001 FORD TAURUS AND THEY HAD A RECALL ON THEIR CAR FOR THIS PROBLEM. ALL THAT WAS DONE WAS PUT A SHIELD AROUND THE COIL SPRING SO THAT WHEN IT DOES BREAK IT DOES NOT PUNCTURE THE TIRE. FORD IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. WHY WOULD THEY NOT HAVE A RECALL AND JUST REPLACE IT? I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED. THIS INCIDENT COST ME $700. I DO HAVE THE OLD COIL SPRING THAT BROKE. I DO FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD COMPENSATE ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  *NM",

TWO DAYS (AND ABOUT 20 MILES) LATER, THE LEFT EXHAUST CAMSHAFT SPROCKET FAILED, CAUSING THE CAR TO STALL AND NOT RESTART.  AS A RESULT OF THE SPROCKET SLIPPING, THE NO. 5 CYLINDER'S PISTON WAS CRACKED DUE TO COMING IN CONTACT WITH AN OPEN VALVE (THIS IS AN INTERFERENCE ENGINE).  15,000 MILES AGO, THE LEFT INTAKE CAMSHAFT SPROCKET FAILED, RESULTING IN A $2900.00 REPAIR BILL FROM A FORD DEALERSHIP.  UNABLE TO AFFORD THE COST OF SUCH A REPAIR AT THIS TIME (NOT TO MENTION UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH THE SAME FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT WANTED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HARDLY EVER HAPPENS AND THAT I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO CAUSE IT THE FIRST TIME), I OPTED TO ATTEMPT THE PROCEDURE MYSELF. AFTER FINDING AND REMOVING THE FAULTY CAMSHAFT, I THOUGHT MY PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED UNTIL I CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS.  THE NO. 5 CYLINDER PLUG WAS COVERED IN OIL, WHICH MEANS THERE IS A BAD PISTON/RING, AND MOST LIKELY VALVES.  I AM CONSIDERING MY OPTIONS TO REPAIR OR PART THE CAR OUT NOW.  I BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY BY FORD DUE TO THE SAFETY ISSUES THAT WILL ARISE WHEN THIS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ON A FREEWAY.

I PURCHASED A 1997 FORD TAURUS IN MARCH 1997 FROM SPRINGFIELD FORD IN DELAWARE COUNTY. THE CAR CAME WITH A 3-YEAR/36,000 MILE WARRANTY. IN MARCH OF 2000 I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THREE MORE YEARS AT THE COST OF $1,000. IN JULY 2000, WITH LESS THAN 30,000 MILES, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND HAD TO BE OVERHAULED. IF I \"DIDN'T\" PURCHASE THE WARRANTY IT WOULD HAVE COST ME IN EXCESS OF $2,000. WELL, THE EXTENDED WARRANTY RAN OUT ON 3-31-03. ON 5-21-03 THE TRANSMISSION WENT AGAIN. IT IS GOING TO COST $2,800 TO REPLACE. THE CAR IS SIX YEARS OLD AND HAS LESS THEN 50,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL CERTIFIED MECHANICS THAT ALL AGREE THAT THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPEN. EITHER FORD CO. HAS A BAD TRANSMISSION FOR THIS TYPE TAURUS OR THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER FIXED RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. WHEN I CONTACTED FORD H.Q. THEY HADN?T HEARD OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS. AND SPRINGFIELD FORD SAID THERE?S NOTHING THEY CAN DO, EVEN AFTER I MENTIONED WE HAVE BOUGHT THREE CARS IN SIX YEARS FROM THEM, IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER. IN CONCLUSION, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I HAVE FIVE KIDS AT HOME AND REALLY DON?T HAVE $2,800 LYING AROUND.

ALL PARTS AND COMPONENTS WERE EITHER SCORCHED OR FAILED WHEN TESTED AND RECOMMENDED A TOTAL REBUILD ($2862) OR PURCHASE A FORD REBUILT ONE ($2756).  I SAID THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A CAR WITH 39,400 MILES ON IT.  THEY SAID THEY COULD DO NOTHING AND I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY.  THEY SOUNDED INTERESTED BUT WOULD NOT BACK UP THEIR PRODUCT DUE TO BEING OUT OF WARRANTY.  (SO MUCH FOR THE QUALITY ONE - CUSTOMER CARE  MOTO).  READING OTHER COMPLAINTS THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM IN THE FORD TAURUS OVER THE YEARS.  WE HAD A 1994 TAURUS THAT HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS TO THE TUNE OF $1,100.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS IS MY LAST FORD PRODUCT AND THEY WONDER WHY PEOPLE BY FOREIGN VEHICLES!.  WHEN I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP TO PUT THE CAR BACK TOGETHER THAT I CAN GET A REBUILT TRANSMISSION FROM 2 OTHER TRANSMISSION SOURCES (USED PARTS FOR $1400) OR NEW REBUILT PARTS FOR $2030), THEY THEN SAID \"LET ME SEE IF THERE IS ANY LAST THING MY MANAGEMENT WILL DO\"  OF COURSE WHEN PUT ON THE SPOT TO LOSE BUSINESS AND RESPECTABILITY THEY LOWERED THEIR PRICE TO $2281 FOR A FORD REBUILT ONE.  I AM STILL CONCERNED SINCE A LOT OF OTHERS SAY THEY HAD FAILURES WITH THEIR 2ND ONE TOO!  IT COMES WITH A 3/36,000 WARRANTY.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS DAY AND AGE THAT THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOTAL REPAIR COSTS WHEN KNOWN DEFECTS OCCUR.

THE ENGINE WOULD RUN ROUGHLY, STALL, AND SURGE, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT, AND GRADUALLY BECAME WORSE. THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM.  AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT A WIRE TO THE FUEL PUMP INSIDE THE FUEL TANK HAD ITS INSULATION WORN OFF DOWN TO THE BARE WIRE, AND HAD SHORTED OUT.  OTHER WIRES ALSO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR, BUT ARE NOT YET WORN THROUGH.  I HAVE DIGITAL PICTURES OF THE WIRES. THE WIRES WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE WAY THE FUEL PUMP WAS ASSEMBLED WITHIN THE GAS TANK.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND IS NOT LIMITED TO ONLY OUR CAR.  FORD HAS ISSUED 3 TSB'S RELATING TO THIS PROBLEM (98251, 5226, AND 12189) AND I HAVE ALSO FOUND SEVERAL RELATED COMPLAINTS IN THE NHTSA DATABASE (ODI ID 549996, 707889, 713208, 807546, 838030, 853283, 879245, 10018293, AND 8012733).

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH . I  HOPE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THESE PARTS REPLACED  BY THE COMPANIES SO THAT NO ONE WITH A MODIFIED HANDICAPPED STEERING COLUMN EXTENSION DOES NOT GET KILLED OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE , I WAS LUCKY TO FIND IT EARLY  BUT MAYBE SOME ONE ELSE WON'T BE.

SOON AFTER THE SALE OF THE CAR TO US, FORD CAME OUT WITH A \u0014BROWN COOLANT\u0014 RECALL, WHICH RAN UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1999.  ALL OWNERS OF THESE 1997 TAURUS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL BY MAIL.  IF NOTIFIED CAR OWNERS BROUGHT THEIR CARS IN DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, THE FORD DEALERS WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM AT NO COST TO THE OWNER.    FORD MOTOR COMPANY NEVER INFORMED US OF THIS RECALL.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE BROUGHT THE CAR INTO NORTH BAY FORD (IN SANTA CRUZ, CA) TO REPAIR A CRACKED COOLANT HOLDING TANK ON JULY 19, 2000, THAT SHE WAS TOLD OF THE REQUIRED RECALL WORK NEED ON HER FORD TAURUS, BUT THE WORK WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER A WARRANTY PAYMENT PROGRAM AND THE COST WAS NOW THE OWNER\u0012S PROBLEM AND THERE WAS NOTHING THE FORD DEALER COULD DO ABOUT IT.  AT THIS TIME WE PAID THE BILL, WHICH WAS OVER $500. THE \u0013BROWN COOLANT\u0014 RECALL PROGRAM WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE OF A DESIGN ERROR IN THE ROUTING OF THE COOLING SYSTEM HOSES INTO AND OUT OF THE DASH HEATER COIL AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE HOSES AROUND THE ENGINE EXHAUST MANIFOLD.  THE RESULT WAS THAT THIS PROBLEM CAUSED THE COOLANT TO TURN INTO BROWN MUD FROM EXCESSIVE RUSTING OF THE ENGINE BLOCK.  WE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY OVER HEATING PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR UNTIL THE COOLANT TANK BEGAN LEAKING.  NOW, BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE RUST IN THE COOLANT, A GALVANIC REACTION DEVELOPS WITH FREEZE PLUGS IN THE ENGINE BLOCK.  THE DEALER INSISTED ON CHANGING THE PLUGS, BUT HE ONLY CHANGED 2 OF THE 4 PLUGS.  THE JOB ALSO INCLUDED A COMPLETE ENGINE FLUSHING TO REMOVE ALL THE OLD RUSTY COOLANT.  ON JULY 7, 2001, BROWN COOLANT BEGAN RUNNING OUT ONTO THE GROUND FOR THE SECOND TIME WHICH REQUIRED ANOTHER $500 TO REPAIR.
