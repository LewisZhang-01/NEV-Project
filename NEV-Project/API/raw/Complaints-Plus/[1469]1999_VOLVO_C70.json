I CONTACTED VOLVO AND THEY SAID THAT THE WARRANTY IS NOT COVERED BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN OVER 10 YEARS.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM A PREVIOUS OWNER IN OCTOBER 2013 AND THEREFORE I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  NOW THEY WANT ME TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $900 TO FIX IT. THEY SAID THE WARRANTY STARTED FROM THE DAY THE FIRST CAR WAS BOUGHT WHICH WAS AUGUST 25, 1999 BUT IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE FROM THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED WITH THE ETM THAT CAUSED VOLVO TO RECALL AND BUY THE CARS BACK.  VOLVO MADE APPROXIMATELY 300,000 CARS AND REPAIRED AND BOUGHT BACK AROUND 165,000 CARS. THIS MEANS THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE ENCOUNTERING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD BY VOLVO THAT THE CAR I CURRENTLY OWN THE SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED IN NORTH CAROLINA. AS I SEE IT THEY NEGLECTED TO CHANGE THE THROTTLE IN THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THIS CAR CAN CAUSE MY FAMILY TO GET IN A CAR ACCIDENT.  THE REGIONAL MANAGER INDICATED THAT THE CAR COULD NOT BE FIXED AND THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR THE LABOR AND THE PARTS.  THEY ARE OFFERING TO GIVE ME A DISCOUNT ON THE REPAIRS BUT I FEEL THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A PROBLEM THAT WAS CAUSED BY THE MANUFACTURER. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISCOUNTS FOR LABOR AND PARTS INDICATE THAT VOLVO UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY CONCERNS AND THE PROBLEMS OF THE CAR BUT ALSO THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. I ASK TO SPEAK TO THE REGIONAL MANAGER AND I WAS TOLD BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED.  I LEFT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.   *TR",
