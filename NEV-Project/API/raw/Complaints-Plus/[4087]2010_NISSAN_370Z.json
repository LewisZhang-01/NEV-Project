        "summary": "My 370 Z Nissan was towed January 16, 2018 because of a problem with the electronic steering mechanism. The mileage at that time was 35,357 miles. Upon entering the car the steering wheel had locked and I could not start my car.  Fortunately the car was in the garage at the time.  total for repairs was $949 On March 29, 2018 a few months following with mileage at 35,857 miles I again experienced a steering lock problem and the car had to be towed once again \u2026the repairs were covered at that time by warranty since this device was already replaced in January. December 9, 2021 I again experienced a problem with the steering lock mechanism mileage is 42,505 at this point on the car repairs were almost $1800  I find this a huge safety problem because I am a female and could be stranded at any time at any given place with a vehicle that wont operate\u2026.  This does concern me as I do travel out of town alone at times.  I also drive at night from time to time . I did ask that the mechanism be disabled and was told by the mechanic at Nissan they were not allowed to disable the mechanism.  My husband spoke with consumer affairs at Nissan and they were not willing to help us with this problem.  I have considered selling the car but I\u2019m not comfortable doing so without disclosing this problem to a potential buyer. My husband I researched this issue online and it appears that many people have experienced the same issue with their 370 Z vehicles",

THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE I TOOK MY CAR SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE THOSE PARTS BUT, ONLY IF I EXPERIENCE THE CLUTCH PEDAL FAILURE AGAIN.

I TRIED TO ORDER THE PART, STEERING LOCK VERSION 'D', BUT IT'S BACKORDERED AND NISSAN USA IS NOT SELLING THIS PART TO CONSUMERS ACCORDING TO NORTHERN VIRGINIA NISSAN DEALERS.  MY ONLY RESOURCE WAS IT GET IT TOWED AND PAY $1450.00 FOR PART + LABOR FROM THE DEALER DIRECTLY.    THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT. MY CAR HAS 5000 MILES ON IT. AND THE STEERING LOCK FAILURE (VERSION A,B,C) HAS HAPPENED TO MANY OWNERS WHO HAVE KEYLESS IGNITION ON NISSAN ON THE GTR MODEL, AND THE PART WAS RECALLED. YET FOR 370Z OWNERS, NO ACTION.
