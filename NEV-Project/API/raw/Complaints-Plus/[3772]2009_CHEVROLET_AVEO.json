TOOK FOUR HOURS FOR TOW TRUCK. . 3 WEEKS FOR THE FUEL PUMP TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED AS THE CAR WAS BRAND NEW W/ LESS THAN 3000 MILES ON IT AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE SPARE PARTS FOR IT. ALSO, DISCOVERED THAT THE ONSTAR WASN'T CONNECTED EVEN THOUGH I WAS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE A FREE YEAR. IT WOULDN'T EVEN COME ON. THEY FIXED THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE FUEL PUMP BUT THEN WHEN I GOT IT BACK I NOTICED MY CLOCK WOULDN'T KEEP TIME AND THE ONSTAR WASN'T SHOWING THE FREE YEAR WHICH NEVER GOT RESOLVED. THE DEALER SAID THEY WASN'T SURE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CLOCK BUT THE REPLACED SOME FUSES, ETC.

AT RED LIGHTS/EXTENDED STOPS IT WILL START IDLING ROUGHLY AND USUALLY WILL SHUT OFF. CAR WILL SOMETIMES NOT ACCELERATE AND OTHER TIMES IT WILL SHOOT OFF LIKE A ROCKET W/ A MILD PRESS OF GAS PEDAL.

I HAVE TAKEN THIS CAR TO 3 CHEVY DEALER MECHANICS AND 2 INDEPENDENTS AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG OTHER THAN 'ELECTRICAL' SAYING I COULD REPLACE THE COMPUTER AND WIRING HARNESS BUT THAT IS NOT A GUARANTEED FIX AND AT ALMOST $2500 NOT WORTH IT AT THIS POINT.

I DID NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT THEN AS OF THE SPRING UNTIL NOW, THE BATTERY HAS BEEN DEAD A DOZEN MORE TIMES.  I TOOK IT INTO A GARAGE WHICH CHECKED EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAR WAS NOT DRAINING THE BATTERY SOMEHOW, BUT THEY CAME UP WITH NO SOLUTIONS BUT TO GIVE ME ANOTHER NEW BATTERY.  BUT SINCE THEN, IT HAS STILL OCCURRED NUMEROUS TIMES.  FOR YEARS, MY CLOCK HAS BEEN WRONG. I WILL SET IT TO THE CORRECT TIME, BUT ONCE THE CAR IS SHUT OFF AND STARTED AGAIN, IT WILL BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIME EACH TIME. I HAVE TRIED TO HAVE SOMEONE LOOK AT IT BUT NO ONE CAN SEEM TO EXPLAIN THAT EITHER.  SO I AM LED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF FAULTY ELECTRICAL SITUATION THAT IS CAUSING ALL THIS STRESS.  THE WRONG TIME, I CAN DEAL WITH.  MY CAR NOT STARTING FOR NO REASON IS A MUCH GREATER DILEMMA.  I AM 7 MONTHS PREGNANT AND HAVE BEEN READING A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S REVIEWS ONLINE STATING THAT THINGS LIKE THIS AND MUCH WORSE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING TO THEM WITH THEIR 2009 CHEVY AVEOS.

HAD THE BATTERY CHECKED AND IT SHOWED A DRAIN ON THE BATTERY BUT COULDN'T FIND THE CAUSE.  AFTER HAVING IT JUMPED THE NEXT TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON FOR A BRIEF TIME THEN WENT OUT.  NEXT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY STOPPED RUNNING.  HAD IT JUMPED AGAIN, IT WOULD TURN OVER BUT DIE AGAIN.  FINALLY HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED.  TOOK IT TO ONE SHOP AND THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM.  NOW IT IS BEING CHECK AT ANOTHER SHOP. SINCE THIS IS THE ONLY TRANSPORTATION I HAVE, I HAVE HAD TO CANCEL APPOINTMENTS AND RELY ON OTHERS FOR OVER A WEEK.

ONCE WHILE DRIVING IT DROPPED THE ACCELERATION TO ABOUT 20 MPH AND WOULD NOT GO ANY FASTER, THEN JUST LOST POWER TO THE ENGINE. I TOOK IT AGAIN FOR ONE WEEK BUT THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I GOT THE CAR BACK AND IT WAS FINE FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS BUT NOW IS HAPPENING REGULARLY. SOMETIMES IT JUST SHAKES QUICKLY BUT SOMETHING THE ACCELERATION COMPLETELY DROPS AND THE CAR WILL JUST STOP WHILE I AM DRIVING, WHICH IS SCARY. I'LL TRY TO ACCELERATE AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN, THEN FINALLY IT WILL GO AGAIN. SOMETIMES I WILL STOP AND THEN THE CAR WILL LURCH FORWARD. THE RPM GAUGE IS ALWAYS MOVING UP AND DOWN. THERE IS NO PATTERN AS TO WHEN IT HAPPENS. I'VE TAKEN THE CAR IN TWO MORE TIMES AND STILL NOTHING. THEY JUST INSTALLED A DATA RECORDER AND I RECORDED FOUR INSTANCES AND GAVE IT BACK; I'M WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULTS. IT'S VERY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE I WILL BE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC AND MY CAR WILL JUST STOP, AND SINCE I AM NOT BRAKING THERE IS NO INDICATION TO THE CAR BEHIND ME. ALSO, NO LIGHTS ARE COMING ON (NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, ETC.). I HAD MY OIL CHANGED THE FIRST TIME SINCE I WAS ABOUT DUE BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.  *TR",

THERE ARE DAYS WHEN IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT HAPPENS THEN THE ENGINE WILL JUST SEEM TO RETURN TO NORMAL, THEN OUT OF THE BLUE THE ENGINE WILL LOSE POWER AGAIN. THERE ARE NEVER ANY WARNINGS OR CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS. NONE HAVE EVER COME ON. WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO 3 DIFFERENT CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS; AND TO ONE INDEPENDENT GARAGE; WHO DID HAVE THE PROBLEM HAPPEN ONCE WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH THE OWNER, BUT THE OTC GENISIS DEVICE COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHAT WAS HAPPENING, IT JUST RECORDED THE HISTORY OF THE EVENT. NONE OF THE CHEVROLET DEALERS COULD GET IT TO DUPLICATE OR FIND ANY CODES IN THE 10 DAYS THEY HAD THE CAR. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE. I HAVE BEEN TAKING VIDEOS WITH MY HTC DROID WHEN THE CAR IS HAVING ITS PROBLEM (FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT WILL DO). IT IS LIKE KEEPING A JOURNAL. I SHOW THE RPM SPIKES AND DROPS; THE SUDDEN DECELERATION AND THE ?NO RESPONSE WHEN THE GAS PEDDLE IS PUSHED. THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED AT ALL SPEEDS, INCLUDING WHEN ON THE FREEWAY.  WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT OVER $600 ON VARIOUS (SO CALLED FIXES); INCLUDING A COMPLETE FUEL SYSTEM CLEANING (INCLUDING THE THROTTLE BODY CLEANING) NONE HAVE EVER HELPED. I WAS TOLD BY A CHEVROLET DEALER IT WAS A BAD O2 SENSOR (BUT NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD EVER CAME ON). O2 SENSORS ALWAYS CAUSE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON. I THINK IT MAY BE THE ENTIRE ECU COMPUTER; BUT NO DEALER WANTS TO ADMIT THAT. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER TODAY 01/04/2011; THERE IS NOTHING MORE THEY WILL DO; BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MUCH NEGITIVE EQUITY. THEY WILL NOT DO A BUY BACK. THEY HAVE WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE ISSUE. TO BAD THERE IS NO USED CAR LEMON LAW. 4 REPAIR ATTEMPTS AND THE PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE. *TR",
