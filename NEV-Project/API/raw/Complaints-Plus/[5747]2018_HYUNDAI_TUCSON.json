I started experiencing hesitation taking off then lunging when stopped in the last few months.  Now I'm sitting in the driveway because it won't start.  Realized oil was low which is odd because I've noticed it's been burning more than previous but no more than a quart so it's not like it was dry.  I'm supposed to be able to get 5k on an oil change now adays but starts running poorly if it's not changed by 3k. Needless to say iadded qt of oil I was going to get oil changed yesterday but wouldn't start.   I changed the battery, still won't start,  starter was tested good,  fuses all in tack, changed camshaft sensors at 90 dollars a piece still nothing. Check alternator that's fine.   It clicks one time but have all lights power everywhere it should.  In 2 days I've spent 215 on a battery, 200 with tax on sensors, 50 code reader no code by the way.  Did have p0014 which indicated need for either oil change or camshaft sensor. Nothing. I'm a sitting duck and all the things I've experience are what they experienced in the theta engines like hesitated,  burning oil, ticking sounds, lunging etc.  GDI isn't any better. I hate this car. After this one is paid off and I guess put a new engine in I'll be getting rid of it.  Going back to a solid Buick. I'll never buy another hyundai. This is the second vehicle with engine problems we bought. Not to mention the risk of for but hyundai near me hasn't been able to get the parts for over a year.  I'm currently in a wait list.",

My car stopped accelerating so I began to pull over and before I could get fully over, all of the engine lights started flashing and the engine began smoking.

Everyday when I start my Tuscon and accelerate, it stutters/jerks like it\u2019s going to stall and will not accelerate/shift. It eventually starts going, but I have to pull out onto a street, which has been unsafe when cars are speeding up behind me. It does not go up hills well at all. I turned onto a road where there was a decent sized hill, but nothing major, and nothing an SUV should have a problem with. My previous CAR could drive it just fine. You\u2019d think an SUV could as well. Nope. Very scary moment. My Tuscon made it not even half way, and just stopped. I was pressing the gas, and it just revved it up with no motion. I braked and tried it again, and it still would not go. I had to roll backwards down the hill. This was the only way to my destination. I rolled down, and put it in sport mode to try that. It still would not go, and did the same thing. I tried again in regular mode, and it still would not go, only this time I had a car behind me. The car had to back down, and I rolled back a little bit, then hit the gas in drive and it eventually made it, but definitely very scary and unsafe, and it put others in danger as well. I was going to church one morning, and the speed limit on the main road is 60, which is what I was driving. I had to slow down to turn, and had to stop to oncoming traffic. I had to brake for maybe 10 seconds, and when I went to accelerate, it was like it wasn\u2019t shifting, and it just revved up, rolled slightly, and would not go. At this point there are more cars coming. I am in the road right In their path due to it rolling, and once again I am put in a very scary situation. I kept trying, and it FINALLY went. This was also on flat level ground. I have had many moments (every day) where it does not shift properly, and it also stutters every single day when I start it. Please fix this",
