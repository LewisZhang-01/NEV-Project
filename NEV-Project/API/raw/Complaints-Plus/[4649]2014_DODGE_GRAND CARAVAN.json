The inferior plastic OEM part is prone to failures causing pressurized oil leaks at the top of the engine that contaminate many other parts to include the exhaust manifold, exhaust components inclusive of the catalytic converter which operates at normal temperature exceeding 650 degrees F. Flash fires accrue frequently in this regard and engaging the occupants, others, environment, and may result in fatalities. There are no check engine lights or safety warnings of any kind for this failure unless oil pressure is lost after the fact.  The OEM parts is not a suitable material for typical engine temps exceeding temps of 200F and will break down on a molecular basis. There is currently an aluminum upgrade manufactured by Dorman, part number 926-876 that is not supported nor provided by Mopar.   I am a retired ASE Master Technician with over 40 years of experience. I have seen over 30 instances of this failure effecting a wide rage of 2014 Chrysler vehicles with the 3.2 and 3.6 liter gas engines. Vehicle mileage is not a factor in this regard. Inferior simply put, OEM Product, plus time, plus normal engine temps will cause the molecular material breakdown and thus component failure. It is aggravated by oil change procedures when even skilled technicians try to change the filter by removing the cover or over torque the cover and fracture the now brittle inferior materials. Internally we have also noticed severe chemical softening of the housing sealing surfaces that remain in constant contact with engine oil. This further proves the inferior product material  incompatibilities.

Eventually some other drivers that were stuck behind me helped me push vehicle to crest of bridge and I coasted to the bottom of the bridge and got out of the roadway. Vehicle was towed to Dodge dealer because it would not restart. Dealer diagnosed problem as Totally Integrated Power Module (TIPM). Cost to repair was $1382. It became quite apparent to me that Chrysler-Dodge has made a fortune replacing these parts on many of their vehicles, to the level that would indicate that there is some defect in the design or manufacturing of these parts.

DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS DUE TO A DEFECTIVE CLOCK SPRING AS THIS COULD BE A DIFFERENT PART FAILURE. HOWEVER CHECKING THE PRICES, A CLOCK SPRING FOR A 2014 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN JUST FOR PARTS COST AROUND $300 PLUS TAX. I AM NOW STUCK WITH A $15,000 VEHICLE THAT COULD KILL ME IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH DUE TO A FAULTY AIRBAG SYSTEM THAT HAS A POSSIBLY FAILING PART FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS MADE BY DODGE AND CHRYSLER GROUP AND HAS SOMEHOW NEVER BEEN RECALLED.

SINCE IT IS A 2014 DODGE GRAND CARARAVAN 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER LOOKING UP ONLINE I SEE THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE AND WONDER WHY THERE IS NO SAFETY RECALL. IT GOES BACK YEARS. THEY PUT A PLASTIC PIECE HOLDING A METAL PIECE UNDER ALL THAT PRESSURE AND THEY THINK IT WILL NOT GIVE WAY AND BREAK? I CAN'T IMAGINE IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THAT WOULD HAVE SCARED ME FOR ONE AND WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.  IMAGINE DRIVING ALONG AND THIS THING POPS OUT AT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. DID IT MAKE A LOUD NOISE? WHAT WOULD YOU BE THINKING? WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE? FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN ONLINE IT WILL COST 900.00 TO REPLACE THIS WHICH WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DEPLOY UNLESS SOMEONE HIT THE REAR OF MY CAR. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AS I CAN'T AFFORD 900.00 TO FIX THIS. AND THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLASTIC THEY USE.",

A COUPLE HOURS LATER IT CAME BACK ON. BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY TRIED THE \"EASY\" FIXES (SPARK PLUGS, WIRES, COIL) AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO THROW THE SAME CODE. THEY BROUGHT IT TO A REGULAR DODGE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY CLEANED THE INJECTORS, SAID THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED AND SENT US ON OUR WAY. WITHIN HOURS IT THREW THE SAME CODE.

I THEN TURNED IT OFF AT STOP SIGN AND RESTARTED IT TERRIFIED, AND WENT HOME SLOW NOT OVER 30 MPH.

I HAVE INQUIRED TO THEM ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE NEW PART AND WHEN THEY WILL COMPLETELY FIX THE ISSUE.  EACH TIME, I AM TOLD BY THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY NEW PARTS, AND WILL CONTACT ME AS SOON AS THEY HAVE THEM.  I FEEL THAT 6 MONTHS IS A SUFFICIENT TIME FRAME TO HAVE THIS FIXED, THINK IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN CARE OF SOONER.  MEANWHILE, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE THE WINDOW IN MY VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THIS.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REMEDY TO THIS PROBLEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

DURING THAT TIME, I WAITED PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER 400 MILES BEFORE I RISKED TRYING THE CRUISE CONTROL AGAIN (AGAIN, WHEN NO VEHICLES WERE NEARBY); NO PROBLEMS AGAIN.    YET, THIS DEFINITELY COULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT-INDUCING DEFECT HAD I BEEN IN TRAFFIC IN WHICH THE UNCONTROLLED DECREASE IN SPEED COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS.    THIS IS OF COURSE A CHRYSLER PRODUCT, NOT A GM,  MY EXPERIENCE WAS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE STORIES I'VE HEARD / READ ABOUT PEOPLE DRIVING COBALTS. I DID REPORT THIS INCIDENT TO THE (ALAMO) RENTAL CAR GUY WHEN I RETURNED THE VEHICLE. BUT AGAIN, AFTER READING ABOUT THE COBALT IGNITION PROBLEMS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I FELT COMPELLED TO REPORT THIS TO NHTSA.  *TR",
