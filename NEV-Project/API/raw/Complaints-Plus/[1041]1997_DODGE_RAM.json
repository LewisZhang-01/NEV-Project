FROM WHAT I SEE ON MY TRUCK AND MY FATHER-IN-LAWS 2003 DODGE RAM IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE MATERIAL THE DASH COMPONENTS ARE MADE FROM. I FEAR IT UNSAFE TO DRIVE SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHEN CATASTROPHIC FAILURE WILL OCCUR. NUMEROUS OTHER DODGE TRUCKS  THAT BELONG TO FRIENDS AND COWORKERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS. ANY ATTENTION YOU CAN GIVE TO THIS ISSUE WILL BE APPRECIATED.  *TR",

THE TRUCK HAD 74254 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AT THE TIME OF THE ENGINE FAILURE.  THE OIL LEVEL IN THE ENGINE WAS NORMAL (FULL) AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.    AFTER THE ENGINE FAILURE, THE TRUCK WAS TOWED  TO THE DODGE TRUCK DEALER IN BOZEMAN, MONTANA. I WAS ADVISED BY THE ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER THAT HE HAD SEEN SEVERAL DODGE TRUCK V-10??S WITH SEIZED ENGINES DUE TO OIL PUMP FAILURES BUT HE KNEW OF NO FACTORY PROGRAM TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE DEALER PROVIDED AN ESTIMATE OF $9461 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE WITH A MOPAR REBUILT ENGINE AND PROVIDE A 3-YEAR WARRANTY ON THE WORK. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY HIGH REPAIR COST QUOTED BY THE DEALER, AND AN APPARENT LACK OF ANY FACTORY PROGRAM TO COVER EVEN A PORTION OF THE REPAIR COST, I ELECTED TO HAVE THE ENGINE REBUILT BY A LOCAL INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP.    DURING DISASSEMBLY OF THE ENGINE, IT WAS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE GEARS IN THE OIL PUMP HAD FRACTURED (BROKEN) IN SEVERAL PLACES. THESE FRACTURES CAUSED A SUDDEN AND COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED FAILURE OF THE OIL PUMP, A COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE OIL PRESSURE, AND SUBSEQUENT SEIZURE OF THE ENGINE A FEW SECONDS OF OPERATION LATER. THE OIL PUMP GEARS  WERE  PHOTOGRAPHED AND THESE IMAGES CAN BE PROVIDED. THE INNER GEAR IS BROKEN IN SEVERAL PIECES. ALL OF THE OIL PUMP PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION. SINCE OIL PUMP GEARS ARE INTERNAL ENGINE PARTS NOT SUBJECT TO ROUTINE PERIODIC MAINTENANCE AND NOT SUBJECT TO ABUSE BY THE VEHICLE OPERATOR, THE FAILURE IS CLEARLY DUE TO MATERIAL DEFECT OR MANUFACTURING DEFECT.    A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED ENGINE SEIZURE IN A HIGHWAY VEHICLE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. SINCE THE REPORTED 8.0L V10 ENGINE SEIZURE IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AN IMMEDIATE PRODUCT RECALL OF DODGE TRUCKS WITH THE 8.0L V10 ENGINE, OR OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION, TO REDUCE FUTURE OCCURRENCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  *NM",

JUST A FEW SECONDS BEFORE, I HAD PULLED OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE,  APPLYING MY BRAKES TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE AND AGAIN APPLIED MY BRAKES AT THE END OF THE PARKING ROW .

I WAS ABLE TO AVOID THE PEDESTRIAN IN THE CROSSWALK AND NEGOTIATE THE PARKING LOT TO AN AREA WHERE I COULD COME TO A STOP AND INSPECT THE VEHICLE.

WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTAIN ANY PEDAL PRESSURE.  WHEN I CHECKED THE RESERVOIR IT WAS EMPTY AGAIN.  I LOCATED THE FLUID ON THE GROUND UNDER MY GAS TANK. THE BRAKE LINE ABOVE THE GAS TANK HAD RUSTED THROUGH.  I HAD THE VEHICLE DELIVERED TO A GOODYEAR REPAIR SHOP, FOR REPAIRS.  THE BRAKE LINE THAT RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE VEHICLE, TO THE REAR END HAD TO BE REPLACED AND THE SYSTEM WAS BLED.  THE BRAKES ARE WORKING NORMALLY AGAIN.

IN FACT, THE INCIDENCE OF THIS FAILURE IS SO WIDESPREAD THAT OWNERS OF THESE MODEL TRUCKS HAVE DEVELOPED A KIT TO LOCATE AND DRILL A \"BLOCKER BOLT\" TO KEEP THE DOWEL PIN FROM FALLING OUT!

CHRYSLER SAID THEY WOULD BUY IT BACK, PENALIZING ME DEARLY ON MILEAGE EVEN THOUGH THE TRUCK HAS HAD PROBLEMS SINCE IT WAS NEW.

I WROTE THEM FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THESE REPAIR COSTS BUT THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST ME BECAUSE REPAIRS WERE NOT DONE AT DODGE. THEY SAID I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THEM FOR HELP FIRST BUT I COULD NOT WAIT FOR A RESPONSE FROM THEM BECAUSE I NEEDED MY VEHICLE RIGHT AWAY. I ALSO DID NOT TRUST THEM TO PROPERLY REPAIR MY VEHICLE. OF COURSE, MY TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY FOR ALL OF THE PROBLEMS.

TRANSMISSIONS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO FIX, AND DODGE SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECTIVE PARTS. I HAVE CONTACTED DODGE/CHRYSLER, AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST ME IN MY TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BECAUSE MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED. THE TRUCK IS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD, AND WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT TO BE MORE RELIABLE. I HAVE NOTICED ON THE COMPLAINT SCREEN ON NHTSA THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THESE COMPLAINTS REGARDING TRANSMISSIONS. I HAVE DOCUMENTATION OF DODGE'S DECLINATION, AS WELL AS MY EFFORTS TO HAVE THEM HELP ME. AT THIS TIME BOTH OUR DODGE TRUCKS ARE UNRELIABLE, AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE TO CONTINUE TO FIX. I HAVE REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND THE U-JOINTS ALSO. ANY AMOUNT OF HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED. IT'S EXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLES WITHOUT CONTINUALLY PUTTING MONEY INTO THEM TO KEEP THEM RUNNING, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TRUCKS ARE ONLY 4 YEARS OLD.

AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS TO THE DEALER MARK THOMAS MOTORS, CHRYSLER, MARK III CONVERSION, GOODYEAR (THIS PROCESS TOOK ABOUT 4 MONTHS), THEY AGREED MAYBE MY TIRES HAD A PROBLEM.  THEY AGREED TO PAY 200.00 TOWARDS A 500.00 BILL TO REPLACE THE TIRES.  I HAD NO CHOICE SINCE I REALLY WANTED TO DRIVE MY NEW VAN. THEY SAID THE TIRES MAY HAVE BEEN TO LIGHT TO BE PUT ON THE HEAVY DUTY VAN.  I HAVE SINCE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE REPLACEMENTS, ALSO GOODYEAR WRANGLERS.  THESE WERE TO BE FOR HEAVY DUTY WEAR.  THEY ARE FAR FROM WEARING WELL.  I HAVE HAD OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE, BUT NONE AS SERIOUS AS THE TIRE PROBLEM.

IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD ALONG WITH A FINAL THREAT TO CALL MY ATTORNEY BEFORE I GOT ANY ASSISTANCE.

WITH IN 10 MILES DRIVING DISTANCE AT 30 MPH DURING DEACCELERATION THE REAR END DIFFERENTIAL MADE A LOUD BANG WHILE THE VEHICAL JERKED VIOLENTLY. AFTER THE LOUD NOISE I HEARD THE DRIVE SHAFT OF THE VEHICAL DRAGING ON THE PAVEMENT. I PROCEEDED TO ATTEMPT TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SLOW DOWN WHEN THE VEHICAL JERKED VIOLENTLY AGIAN. AT THIS POINT I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH AND THE REAR WHEELS LOCKED UP AND BEGAIN TO SLIDE. I RELEASED THE BRAKE PEDAL BUT THE SLIDING CONTINUED DUE TO A MAJOR FAILURE IN THE DIFFERENTIAL. LUCKILY I DID NOT LOOSE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE TRUCK DURING WHEEL LOCKUP. WHEN THE TRUCK STOPPED I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK AND OBSERVED THE REAR END OF THE DRIVE SHAFT ON THE PAVEMENT. I COULD NOT MOVE THE VEHICAL DUE TO THE JAMMED DIFFERENTIAL, THE VEHICAL WAS TOWED TO TO A LOCAL DODGE DEALER SHIP. IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT FREEWAY SPEEDS IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT A SERIOUS OR FATAL ACCIDENT COULD HAVE OCCURED. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I HAVE WITH DODGE IS THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL FAILED THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE VEHICAL WAS ALMOST NEW AT 13000 MILES. THE FIRST FAILURE OCCURED APPROXIMATELY ON 3/98. LUCKLY THE FAILING DIFFERENTIAL MADE VERY PRONOUNCED HUMMING NOISES BEFORE ANY CATASTROPHIC FALUIRE OCCURED. AT THAT TIME I TOOK THE VEHICAL TO ALLEN SAMUEL DODGE IN FORT WORTH TEXAS FOR REPAIR. ALLEN SAMUEL DODGE TECHNITIONS IDENTIFIED THAT THE BEARINGS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL HAD FAILED AND CAUSED THE RING AND PINION GEAR TO SEVERLY WEAR. DUE TO THE HISTORY DEMONSTRATED WITH MY EXPERINCES I AM CONCERNED THAT DODGE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN AND OR METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE REAR ENDS OF THEIR 1/2 TON PICKUPS.*AK",

I TOOK IT BACK TO AUTO NATION AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THEY TOOK IT TO DICKINSON DODGE (910) 864-2411 AND THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO DUPLICATE.  THE PROBLEM CONTINUED PERIODICALLY UNTIL APRIL WHEN THE TRANSMISSION STARTED SLIPPING.  THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN WHEN I WAS IN REVERSE THEN WOULD TRY TO PUT IT IN DRIVE.  THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HESITATE AND IT WAS LIKE I WAS IN NUETRAL.  AFTER A FEW SECONDS THE DRIVE GEAR WOULD KICK IN AND IT WAS FINE.  A FEW TIMES I HAD TO PUT IT IN D2 THEN PULL OUT AND PUT IT IN DRIVE.  I HAD DICKINSON DODGE CHECK THIS AGAIN AND THEY COULD FIND NO PROBLEM.  IN LATE JUNE I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE AND TOLD DICKINSON TO CHECK THE TRANSMISSION AGAIN AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING OR GET IT TO DUPLICATE THE SLIPPING AND STALLING.  THEY DI REPLACE THE SERPENTINE BELT AND TOLD ME THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PROBLEM BUT IT WASN'T.  TWO DDAYS AFTER ON JULY 1ST I WAS DRIVING AROUND FAYETTEVILLE AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  I CONTACTED DICKINSON DODGE AGAIN AND ON 5 JULY TOOK IT IN.  INITIALLY THEY SAID THE FAULT REGISTERED AS A DROP IN  RPM'S.  THEY COULD NOT FIND THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM AND THOUGHT IT WAS ELECTRICAL INITIALLY.  THEN ON 6 JULY THEY DECIDED TO DROP THE TRANSMISSION PAN AND FOUND THE TORQUE CONVERTER WAS SEPARATING AND PUTTING METAL FRAGMENTS IN THE TRANSMISSION.  THEY SAID THIS ATE AWAY THE SEAL FOR THE GEAR BOX AND ALLOWED OIL IN THE CLUTCHES.  THAT WAS CAUSING THE SLIPPAGE AND THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REBUILT.  THEY ALSO SAID MY OVERDRIVE GEAR WAS ALREADY OUT.  THEY SAID IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $1500 TO REBUILD IT.  I HAVE ALREADY SPENT $95 FOR TESTING WHICH SHOWED NOTHING AND ANOTHER $80 FOR THE SERPENTINE BELT REPLACEMENT.  I WOULD THINK A TRUCK WITH ONLY 48,000 MILES ON IT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  I AM SUSPECTING IT MAY BE A FLOOD VEHICLE.*AK",

I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THE DODGE TRUCK, AND ACCORDING TO THE DEALER , THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM, AS THEY HAVE HAD MANY TRUCKS WITH THE SAME TROUBLE IN THEIR AREA, NOT TO MENTION COUNTRY WIDE.  THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING FROM CHANGING OUT THE REAR WINDOW (3 TIMES), TO REPLACING THE SEAL AND HOUSING SURROUNDING THE BRAKE LIGHT ABOVE THE REAR WINDOW.  ALL OF THESE 'ATTEMPTS' HAVE FAILED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  WE NEED HELP IN GETTING THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM REMEDIED PROMPTLY , BEFORE MORE DAMAGE PRESENTS ITSELF IN TOTAL SHUTDOWN OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (OR WORSE) WHILE DRIVING.  PLEASE CONTACT US FOR MORE INFO IF NEEDED.  THANK YOU.",

THEY RECEIVED MY TRUCK WITH 29,000 MILES ON IT CONTINUED TO DRIVE TILL WARRANTY EXPIRED AND CLAIMED NOTHING WAS WRONG. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM IT HAS LOOSENED THE THE REAR SHACKLES CAUSING THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL TO BECOME LOOSE AND CAUSE EXTREME WEAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE TIRES. I HAVE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO SATISFACTION WITH THE EITHER DEALERSHIP THIS VEHICLE IS A LEMON. IN THE PAST I HAD TO RETURN IT 7 TIMES TO HAVE A WATER LEAK FIXED, OF COURSE NO DOCUMENTATION WAS GIVEN TO ME, AT THE TIME IT NEVER OCCURED TO ME THAT THIS WOULD BE USEFUL. SMART ON THEIR PART.
