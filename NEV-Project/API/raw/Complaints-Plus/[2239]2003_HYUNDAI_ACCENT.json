I ALMOST GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT WHILE GOING TO WORK WITH MY STUDENTS. I REPORTED IT TO HYUNDAI MOTOR OF AMERICA AND TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIRS IN SEPTEMBER 2007. THEY INSTALLED A REFURBISHED TRANSMISSION AND TOOK CARE OF ANOTHER POWERTRAIN ISSUE AND INSTALLED A NEW ALTERNATOR. HOWEVER IN THE FALL OF 2008 THE BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR WENT OUT AND I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO GET IT FIXED ALTHOUGH THE ALTERNATOR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.
