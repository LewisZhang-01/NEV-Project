I RECEIVED IT END OF NOVEMBER, SHORTLY AFTER RECEIVING WINDOWS BEGAN LEAKING WHICH MILDEWED BADLY, FLOORING STARTED COMING UP. I CONTACTED BUILDER SEVERAL TIMES WITH MY ISSUES, SHE ALWAYS HAD AN EXCUSE. AFTER CONNECTING WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHO HAD THE SAME ISSUES WITH THIS BUILDER I BECAME CONCERNED. I TOOK MY TRAILER TO A PROFESSIONAL RV RESTORER FOR A FULL INSPECTION WHICH REVEALED MORE THAN JUST AESTHETIC ISSUES. PRACTICALLY ALL MATERIALS USED TO CONSTRUCT ARE NOT EVEN FOR EXTERIOR USE...RIVETS, HINGES, WOOD, ETC. AND THEN THERE'S THE SAFETY CONCERN..WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, ETC.   FORTUNATELY, SHE AGREED TO GIVE ME A FULL REFUND AND I SENT THE TRAILER BACK.   MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER TRAILERS OUT ON THE ROAD BUILT BY THIS COMPANY.  EITHER SHE KNOWINGLY USED CHEAP AND UNSUITABLE MATERIALS OR SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING, BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS COMPANY. SHE CLAIMS TO BE NHTSA CERTIFIED BUT I'M MOT SURE HOW THATS POSSIBLE.",
