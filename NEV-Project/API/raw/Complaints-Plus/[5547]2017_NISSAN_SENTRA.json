The car was undriveable after the accident and was towed to a tow lot. The insurance adjuster said that it was a total loss.

HAD TO BACK UP THE ENTRANCE RAMP TO I-65 TO AVOID BEING HIT BY SEMI'S COMING DOWN THE RAMP.CALLED NISSAN EMERGENCY ROADSIDE SERVICE AND THEY HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A NISSAN DEALER (HUBLER NISSAN) THEY TOLD US THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT I TOOK THE CAR TO M'LADY NISSAN ON 02/02/2018 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ERRATIC SHIFTING, THEY FOUND NO PROBLEMS. ON 06/11/2019 I AGAIN TOOK THE CAR TO M'LADY NISSAN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT RPM'S JUMPING AS THE CAR ATTEMPTED TO SHIFT AND NOT WANTING TO SHIFT AT ALL GOING FOWARD ON A FLAT SURFACE ROAD. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A WEEK AND SAID THE FOUND NO PROBLEMS. AT THE TIME THE TRANS WENT OUT, THE CAR ONLY HAD 3,548 MILES ON IT. FOR THE SECOND COMPLAINT AFTER THE NEW TRANS WAS PUT IN THE CAR ONLY HAD 4201 MILES ON IT. WE NOW ONLY USE THE CAR FOR LOCAL TRIPS AS WE ARE AFRAID TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE ROAD AND THE TRANSMISSION  CONTINUES TO ACT ERRATICALLY. NISSAN WON'T DO ANYTHING  FOR US AND M'LADY NISSAN (WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR) DOESN'T OR WON;T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THEY DID TELL US IF THE TRANS GOES OUT AGAIN WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING DONE UNDER THE LEMON LAW",
