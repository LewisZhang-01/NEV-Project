It is my opinion that these are all related to voltage issues or module problems.  i have had multiple infotainment issues with delays loading, freezing up etc.  dealer has ran updates and checks with nothing found.  In October around $35k miles the truck Radio would not work if i used the push button start.  if i shut the truck off opened the door and let everything reset i could push the start button in the truck and the radio would work majority of the time.  The next day i went out to a completely dead truck.  I talked to my service department at the local dealer and they said i would need to bring it in but suggested i disconnect the batteries and recharge the batteries.  after doing so everything started working correctly.  it fixed my radio problem and never went dead again.  since then i have experienced popping noises through the speakers when playing music occasionally. over the last few weeks i noticed the engine does not attempt to increase cold idle speed until i press the brake to put it in gear.   January 22nd i hit the autostart button and it did not work.  i started the truck and it had CEL, Traction control, park brake and wrench, lights on with service emissions, and power reduced messages displayed.  Truck is running odd.  codes present are (ENGINE GMLAN)P0118 - engine coolant temp circuit high voltage, (BRAKES GMLAN_ABS) U0401- invalid data from engine control module, P0562- system voltage low,  (HVAC CONTROLS GMLAN_HVAC) B1325 - . control module power circuit.  Truck is starting and charging fine.  No connection issues at batteries.  There are many TSB's and many complaints regarding similar issues.  common brake and emissions faults with minor differences.  Module failures, communication faults, and or electrical faults are likely causing all of these similar issues.  they need to be categorized as the same failure group which will show GM has a bigger issue.",

WHEN BUMPER WAS REPAIRED THE SERVICE PERSON SAID SENSORS WERE FIXED, YET, TO HIS SURPRISE,  WE WERE ABLE TO INCH UP TO A CAR DIRECTLY INTERSECTING THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND IT DID NOT PICK IT UP.  I DID A SIMILAR TEST WITH A BRAND NEW/UNSOLD VEHICLE ON DEALER LOT  IND IT FAILED TO SENSE THE LARGE TRUCK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT.
