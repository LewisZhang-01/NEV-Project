AS YOU CAN SEE BY PIC 2 THE SHORT OCCURRED WHEN THE \"HOT\" WIRE INSULATION WAS WORN THROUGH ON THE FLOAT BRACKET.  IN ORDER TO BLOW A 20A FUSE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPARK.  FORTUNATELY, IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTACT POINT WAS UNDER THE LEVEL OF THE GASOLINE WHEN THE SHORT OCCURRED AND NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED.  IF THE POINT HAD BEEN ABOVE THE GASOLINE IN THE VAPOR AREA THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT.  PIC 3 IS HOW I ROUTED THE WIRE BEFORE REPLACING THE ASSEMBLY BACK IN THE TANK.

NOT TO MENTION THE SAFETY ISSUE--ESPECIALLY WITH MY BABIES RIDING IN THE CAR.  IT SHAKES ALL OVER THE ROAD WHEN I PUT MY BRAKES ON AND I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT THE BRAKES JUST MIGHT QUIT WORKING ALL OF A SUDDEN.  I SEE IN THE COMPLAINT SECTION OF YOUR WEB SITE THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT PREMATURE WEAR OF THE BRAKE ROTORS AND VIBRATING WHEN BRAKING.  IF THIS IS A CONTINUING PROBLEM, BUT IS NOT OFFICIALLY A \"RECALL\" YET, IS THERE SOME WAY THAT I CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE ON GETTING THIS PROBLEM FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL AT THE MANUFACTURER'S EXPENSE?  I'VE ALREADY SPENT MORE THAN I COULD AFFORD TO TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT IT ISN'T FIXED.  AND I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE MONEY THAT I CAN PUT INTO THIS PROBLEM, BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO REPLACE THE CAR.

ONE MECHANIC ACTUALLY DROVE THE CAR AND IT HAPPENED TO HIM (I WAS A PASSENGER IN THE CAR WHEN IT HAPPENED.)  HE FELT THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS STUCK AND TOLD ME TO BRING IT TO THE DEALER.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER TWO TIMES.  THEY SAID THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CRUIS CONTROL AND REPLACED THE WIRE HARNESS AND DID A TUNEUP.  IT IS STILL HAPPENING WHEN IT IS DAMP OR WET OUT.  LIVING IN VERMONT THERE IS A LOT OF DAMP AND WET WEATHER.  I'M ACTUALLY AFRAID TO OPERATE THE CAR IF IT IS RAINING OUT.  I DON'T WANT TO GET THE DEALER IN TROUBLE BECAUSE IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT IN REPAIRING MY CAR.  I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  I SAW A DOCUMENTARY ON DATELINE LAST NIGHT THAT SAID OTHER MERCURY OWNERS HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH ACCIDENT RESULTING.  SHOULD I CONTINUE TO DRIVE MY CAR?  SHOULDN'T THE MANUFACTURER SHARE SOME TO THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE DEFECT.  WOULD HAVING THE CRUISE CONTROL DISARMED PREVENT THE AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION?  PLEASE HELP ME IN THIS MATTER.
