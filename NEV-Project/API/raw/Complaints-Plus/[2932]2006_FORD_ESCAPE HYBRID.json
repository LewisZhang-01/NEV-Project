SO I SAID \"SHOULDN'T MINE BE COVERED?\" SIMILARLY, THE 14S19 RECALL NOTICE STATES: \"MODEL YEAR 2005-2008 FORD ESCAPE HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES MANUFACTURED OCTOBER 13, 2003, TO JUNE 20, 2008\".    I BOUGHT THE CAR IN LATE 2015, AFTER THE INITIAL RECALL DATE WAS ISSUED AND THE DEALER STATED THAT THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING RECALL MATTERS WITH THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THE CAR ONLY HAD 60,000 MILES ON IT AND WAS LIGHTLY USED SO I WONDER IF THE PREVIOUS OWNER WAS EVEN  AWARE OF THE MECS ISSUES.     THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I AM CURRENTLY FACING $1,300 IN REPAIR COSTS AND THIS LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE RECALL PROBLEMS MENTIONED IN 14S19. I HOPE SOMEONE AT NHTSA CAN HELP BECAUSE I THINK FORD SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE DAMAGES. THANKS AGAIN.      PLEASE CONTACT ME AT [XXX] IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

EVERYTHING WE HAVE READ POINTS TO A PROBLEM THE ALTERNATOR. EVERY POST WE HAVE READ, AROUND 40, SAYS THE SAME THING. FORD NEEDS TO RECALL ALL FORD ESCAPES TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR VEHICLES LOSING POWER AND GETTING HIT FROM BEHIND MY A TRACTOR TRAILER. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS. OR FORD CAN REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH A NEW ONE. SOME POSTS DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT WARNING LIKE WE DID, THEY SAID IT JUST SHUT DOWN FOR NO REASON. I BELIEVE FORD KNOWS THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH MIST OF NO ALL FORD ESCAPES WITH THIS ISSUE, BUT BELIEVE THEY ARE COVERING UP THE PROBLEM.

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THIS PUMPING OF THE BRAKES HAS CAUSE THE BREAK PEDAL TO GO FROM HARD/IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH TO COMPLETELY SOFT HITTING THE FLOOR WITH NO BRAKING CAPABILITIES. ON THESE OCCASIONS I AM FORCED TO PULL OF THE ROAD QUICKLY, DOWNSHIFT TO LOW GEAR AND EVEN USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO AVOID CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. ONLY ABOUT 60% OF THE TIME WHEN THIS EVENT OCCURRED DOES THE ABS LIGHT, BRAKE LIGHT AND SERVICE BRAKE SYSTEM WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATE OR DISPLAY. WHEN THIS OCCURRES I AM USUALLY FORCED TO TURN THE ENGIN OFF, REMOVE THE KEY, LET THE SYSTEM PURGE (MAKES NOISE) AFTER THE VEHICLE SITS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN RESTART THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO KEEP DRIVING AND FIX THE ISSUE. SOMETIMES IT FIXES TO ISSUE FOR THE REST OF THE DRIVING TIME WHILE OTHERS ONLY WORK TEMPORARILY AND THE ISSUE RETURNS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. I FEEL THAT THIS BRAKING ISSUE IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR MY FAMILY AND I AND OUR PIECE OF MIND IN THE SAFETY OF THIS VEHICLE IS NOT GOOD. AS AN ADDITIONAL NOTE THIS BRAKE ISSUE ONLY BECAME EVIDENT AFTER WE HAD ANOTHER RECALL ISSUE FIXED ON THIS VEHICLE FOR STALLING. BEFORE THAT FIX WE NEVER HAD ANY BRAKING ISSUES.",

WE CHOSE TO PAY HIM AND DRIVE THE CAR HOME.   TOOK VEHICLE TO DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE. THEY NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROBLEM.  THEY REPLACED REAR BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS BECAUSE THERE WAS ALSO LOUD BRAKE NOISE.      NOW ONE YEAR LATER, JULY 27 2015, [97000+ MILES] SLOWING FOR A RIGHT TURN ON A RURAL HIGHWAY AND THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED AGAIN.   WITH NO WARNING THE PEDDLE WENT TO THE FLOOR.  WITH A CONCERTED EFFORT I WAS ABLE TO SLOW THE VEHICLE AND MAKE THE TURN WITHOUT INCIDENT.   THE ABS LIGHT AND SERVICE BRAKE WARNING LIGHTS WERE LIT.   CONDITION PERSISTED AS WE CONTINUED A FEW MILES TO THE SHOPPING PLAZA.   AFTER SHOPPING WE DECIDED TO RETURN DIRECTLY HOME, BUT WHEN CAR WAS STARTED THE FAULT HAD CLEARED AND THE BRAKES FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.   WE HAVE JUST SPENT THE MORNING SEARCHING INTERNET AND FIND THIS IS AN ISSUE FORD KNOWS ABOUT AND IS DENYING TO ACKNOWLEDGE.   AND APPARENTLY IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO RESOLVE WITH THE NEED TO REPLACE THE HCU.   WE NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS BUT ARE AMONG THE MANY WHO FEEL THIS IS CERTAINLY A SERIOUS ENOUGH SAFETY ISSUE FORD SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN ITS RESOLVE FOR OWNERS WITH DEFECTIVE BRAKE SYSTEMS.    OUR EXPERIENCE SO FAR IS, THAT THOUGH THERE IS SOME ABILITY TO BRAKE IT IS NOT ANYWHERE EQUAL TO THE 'NORMAL' BRAKING CAPACITY AND THAT IS DANGEROUS.

I CALLED THE CAR LOT THE NEXT MORNING AND SPOKE WITH A MAN NAMED [XXX].  I TOLD HIM THE SITUATION.  HE TOLD ME WHEN HE GOT TO THE CAR LOT HE WOULD PULL MY FILE AND CALL ME BACK. 3 HOURS WENT BY AND NOTHING.  SO I WENT TO THE CAR LOT AND THERE HE WAS.  HE DID NOT LOOK HAPPY TO SEE ME.

WE ENDED UP CALLING THE FORD HOUSE (ARROW FORD, ABILENE, TX.). THEY TOWED THE VEHICLE AND I GOT A CALL LATER SAYING IT WAS A BAD TORQUE CONVERTER. IT WAS GOING TO BE $2,400.00 FOR THE REPAIR. I RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO RECALL AND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM, (A DESIGN FLAW IF YOU WILL). WE TAKE CARE OF THE VEHICLES AND DON'T ABUSE OUR VEHICLES.  *TR",

AGAIN THIS HAPPENED 2 DAYS AGO ON MY WAY TO WORK, AND HAD TO PULL OFF THE STREET INTO A PARKING LOT AND SLAMMED ON THE GAS PEDAL UNTIL IT LOOSENED UP.  I LOOKED ON LINE FOR REVIEWS ON 2006 FORD ESCAPES, AND SAW THAT MANY, MANY OTHER FORD ESCAPE OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I BROUGHT IT YESTERDAY MORNING TO AUTONATION FORD IN BROOKSVILLE, FLORIDA AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BODY ASY - CARBURETOR THROTTLE, CABLE ASY - THROTTLE CONTROL NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THIS, AND THAT THIS WAS COMMON IN FORD ESCAPES. HE STATED THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY HAZARD AND ADVISED THAT I SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING THE CAR THE WAY IT WAS.   THE REPAIRS ARE COSTING ME OVER $600, AND WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT I READ ABOUT ON LINE, I FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD BE A FORD RECALL, AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE REIMBURSED THEIR COSTS TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED.  *TR",

I CALLED GANLEY FORD AS SOON AS THEY OPENED, BUT THE BODY SHOP WON'T BE OPEN UNTIL MONDAY. THIS IS MY WIFE'S PRIMARY CAR, AND WITH WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED, I'M RELUCTANT TO HAVE HER, OR ANYONE, DRIVE IT UNTIL THE PROBLEM'S ADDRESSED - AND THE EXTENT OF THE CORROSION IS ASTONISHING. WITH A 400++ POUND BATTERY LOCATED BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHT UPPER SHOCK MOUNTS, AND WITH THE EXTENT OF THE CORROSION I JUST FOUND, I'M EQUALLY CONCERNED FOR THE LEFT REAR UPPER SHOCK MOUNT AND BODY PAN INTEGRITY, AS WELL AS FOR THE HYBRID SYSTEM AND BATTERY PACK.  PLEASE HELP ME TO GET INTO IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THE PROPER FORD ZONE REPRESENTATIVE TO GET A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND DECIDE WHERE TO GO FROM HERE - THIS IS A PREMIUM HYBRID SUV THAT I THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED BEFORE SELECTING TO PURCHASE, AND NOW I'M AFRAID TO EVEN MOVE IT FROM MY PARKING DECK AT THE OFFICE.

THIS WAS FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY SEVERE POWER LOSS FROM THE ENGINE. SHE DROVE IT TO THE NEXT BEST OFF-RAMP, AN ADDITIONAL 2 MILES. WHEN SHE GOT OFF THE FREEWAY SHE SAYS SHE HAD TO REV IT UP QUITE A BIT TO MAKE AN INTERSECTION TO GET TO THE GAS STATION WHERE THE CAR ROLLED TO A STOP.    THAT LOUD BANG TURNED UP TO BE THE NBR 3 CYLINDER BLOWING ITS SPARK PLUG CLEAN OFF THE SPARK PLUG BORE. THE SPARK PLUG BORE WAS COMPLETELY THREADLESS. THE SUBSEQUENT POPPING SOUNDS WERE DUE TO THE SPARK PLUG NOT BEING ON THE NBR 3 CYLINDER AS THE FUEL THAT CONTINUED TO SPRAY INTO THE CYLINDER WAS BURNING OFF. THE IMMEDIATE POWER LOSS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE ENGINE LOOSING 25% OF ITS CHUGGA-CHUGGA AND THE LOSS OF THE CHT SENSOR SIGNAL WHICH BOTH THEN CAUSED THE PCM (POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE) TO GO INTO LIMP MODE AND FURTHER REDUCE ENGINE POWER.    FIRST THING I DID WAS PLUG IN MY OBDII SCANNER AND CHECK FOR CODES. I FOUND THE FOLLOWING THREE: P0303 - CYLINDER 3 THREE MISFIRE. P0353 - IGNITION COIL 'C' PRIMARY/SECONDARY CIRCUIT. P1289 - CYLINDER HEAD TEMP SENSOR HIGH INPUT.    I THEN PERFORMED A KOEO (KEY-ON/ENGINE-OFF) CHECK WITH MY OBDII SCANNER AND FOUND THE FOLLOWING TWO CODES: P0119 - ENGINE COOLANT TEMPERATURE CIRCUIT INTERMITTENT/ERRATIC. P1289 - CYLINDER HEAD TEMP SENSOR HIGH INPUT.    THE CHT PROBE (CYLINDER HEAD TEMPERATURE) COVER/BOOT WAS POPPED OFF THE ENGINE CAMSHAFT COVER AND THE WIRES WERE BROKEN OFF THE CHT PROBE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. THE SPARK PLUG TERMINAL BROKE OFF.

SINCE THERE IS NO RECALL ISSUED AND THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THE COST TO REPAIR THE SEAT BELT AND AIR BAG IS ALL MY RESPONSIBILITY. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUED FOR THIS VEHICLE AND ANY OTHERS KNOWN TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD IT TOOK A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VEHICLES TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM BEFORE ANY AGENCY WOULD ISSUE A RECALL. EVEN ONE VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM SHOULD PROMPT A RECALL, BECAUSE TECHNICALLY, THIS MALFUNCTION COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH.  *TR",

THE MECHANIC ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY OFFICE TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE & SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE MY TRANSMISSION WAS STICKING FOR SOME REASON. HE CALLED A TRANSMISSION GUY HE KNOWS NOT FAR FROM THERE & I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT THERE. HE DROVE IT & SAID IT WAS CLUNKING BAD & IT SOUNDED LIKE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. HE KEPT IT OVER THE WEEKEND TO LOOK EVERYTHING OVER. ON MONDAY AFTERNOON HE CONTACTED ME & SAID THAT THE CLUNKING WAS THE WHEEL BEARING HUB ASSEMBLY AND ONCE THEY FIX THAT, THAT COULD STILL JUST BE THE FIRST PART OF THE PROBLEM. HE WAS RIGHT.  AFTER TEST DRIVING IT AGAIN HE HEARD ANOTHER NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE IN WORDS.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS THE TRANSFER CASE & SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRANSFER CASE CONTROLLING THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE WHICH IS ALL RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION. AT FIRST I WAS GOING TO LET HIM ORDER THE GENERIC PARTS, BUT AFTER I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE WARRANTIES FOR 2006 FORD ESCAPES I CALLED HIM BACK AND SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT WHAT I FOUND ABOUT THE POWER TRAIN AND TRANSMISSION MODULES UNDER THE EMISSIONS WARRANTY BEING COVERED UP TO 80,000 MILES. HE SAID EMISSIONS HAS TO DO WITH POLLUTION. SO I JUST SAID ORDER THE FORD PARTS INSTEAD IN THE EVENT THAT I HAVE TO REVISIT THIS SITUATION.

NEEDLESS TO SAY WHEN I COMPLAINED ENOUGH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THEY CHECKED THE SUV AND REPLACED THE WHEEL BEARING AT 5,000 MILES, IT ALSO NEEDED NEW SWAYBAR LINKS,AT ABOUT 8,000 MILES THEY TOLD ME THEY ORDERED  THEM. HOWEVER WEEKS LATER THEY STILL HAD NOT RECEIVED THE PARTS AND I THEN STARTED HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY BRAKES, WHEN I PUSHED THE BRAKE ON THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD VIBRATE. THEN AT 13,000 MILES I HAD TO REPLACE BOTH ROTORS AT MY EXPENSE BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO PAY FOR THEM UNDER WARRANTY( FUNNY ISN'T IT YOU HAVE A BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY TILL 36,000 AND IT ISN'T COVERED ). NOW IT HAVING 18,000 MILES I  HAD TO HAVE THE NEW ROTORS TURNED.  THE DEALERSHIP NEVER REPLACED THE SWAYBAR LINKS. I THOUGHT IF YOU HAD A A PROBLEM THEY COULD NOT FIX IT WOULD FALL UNDER THE LEMON LAW IN MISSOURI, IT IS APPARENT THEY CAN NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. WHAT CAN I DO ? I HAVE  A 8 MONTH OLD GRANDSON IN THE VEHICLE EVERYDAY (WELL WHEN IT ISN'T IN THE SHOP FOR SOME REASON) I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING WITH THE FRONT END PROBLEMS IT KEEPS HAVING.
