        "summary": "Driving on highway and my car started to lose power. When I pulled over and cut it off it wouldn't come on was making a sound as if it was trying to turn on. The engine light came on and a symbol that looked like a lighting bolt in-between two parentheses came on. I sat for 20 mins after trying numerous of times to turn it on and after calling a tow truck. Eventually it came on and I was able to get home but as I was driving the rmp kept going high and the it was making noises. I got home and looked up the symbol and it said it's the electric throttle.  I found it strange for this to be happening when I just purchased it last year and I only had 33120 miles on it.  I called the dodge dealership and got the run around and bringing it in to be fixed. Eventually I was able to find another dodge dealership and they kept my vehicle for a week straight.  Then they said it was the crankshaft sensor and connector that needed to be replaced I also had them do a oil change as well. Just got my truck back today 10/12/2021. whenever I go over 70 my rmp still goes up and it has a noise as if its having issues picking up speed and have a slight vibration with it.  I'm extremely nervous about driving it now. Asked the dealership is this normal and he told me basically all the new vehicles goes thru this because of the plastic parts that is used at manufacturers he also said that it could happen again who knows. That made me really uncomfortable.  I don't know what to do and the dodge dealership is not much help.",
