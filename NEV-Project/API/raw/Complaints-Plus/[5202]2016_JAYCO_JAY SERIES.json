        "summary": "ON MAY 4, 2018, I BOUGHT 3 EACH CARLISLE RADIAL TRAIL RH TRAILER TIRES IN SIZE ST235/85R16 LOAD RANGE F FOR MY JAYCO EAGLE 323LKTS RV.  I BOUGHT A FOURTH JUST BEFORE THAT DATE.  IN OCTOBER 2019, ONE FAILED CATASTROPHICALLY ON LEVEL, PAVED ROAD AT 65MPH WITH APPROXIMATELY 5000 MILES ON IT.   THE ENTIRE TREAD, BELTS AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE SEPARATED, LEAVING ONLY THE SIDEWALLS BEHIND.  I HAD VISUALLY INSPECTED ALL TIRES FOR PROPER INFLATION AND DEFECTS JUST 3 MILES BEFORE THE FAILURE.       ON JUN 8, 2020, A SECOND TIRE FAILED CATASTROPHICALLY.  THIS TIME, MOST OF THE TIRE IS INTACT.  THE INTERNAL BELTS (STEEL, NYLON AND POLYESTER) FAILED ON LEVEL, PAVED HIGHWAY AT 65MPH WITH APPROXIMATELY 7000 MILES ON IT.  PART OF THE TREAD HAS SEPARATED.  THERE IS NO SIGN OF A PUNCTURE OR SIDEWALL DAMAGE WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED DEFLATION PRIOR TO THE STEEL BELT FAILING.  THIS FAILURE DAMAGED MY RV.    I DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO AVOID TIRE FAILURE.  I USE LOAD RANGE F TIRES WHICH ARE RATED FOR 3960 POUNDS AT 95 PSI, STRONGER THAN LOAD RANGE E REQUIRED BY MY RV.  BEFORE EVERY TRIP, I SET THE PRESSURE AT 95 PSI, I CHECK THE LUG NUTS FOR PROPER TORQUE, AND I INSPECT THE TIRES FOR NICKS, CUTS OR OTHER DAMAGE.  I INSPECT MY TIRES AT EVERY STOP.  I USE WHEEL COVERS.  MY RV PUTS 2505 POUNDS LOAD ON EACH TIRE (12,100 LB LOADED WEIGHT - 2080 HITCH WEIGHT = 10,020LB / 4 TIRES = 2505LB), ONLY 63% OF THE TIRE?S RATED CAPACITY.  BOTH TIRES WERE MOUNTED BY A TIRE SHOP AND WERE BALANCED.  THE RV HAS NO VISIBLE AXLE DEFECT.  NEITHER OF THE TIRES EXHIBITED UNUSUAL WEAR BEFORE FAILURE.    ONE FAILED DUE TO STEEL BELT FAILURE, AND THE SECOND LIKELY FAILED DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE.  IT IS CLEAR TO ME (I?M AN ENGINEER) THAT THE BELTS ARE OVERSTRESSED AND/OR ARE SEPARATING INTERNALLY FROM SURROUNDING RUBBER DURING TURNS WHEN THE TIRES ARE LOADED LATERALLY, THEN THE BELTS ARE FAILING AT HIGH SPEED.  IT IS MY BELIEF THIS MODEL/DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AS A SAFETY HAZARD TO THE DRIVING PUBLIC.  *TR",
