MECHANIC WHO MADE ON SITE REPAIR CONFIRMED IT WAS NOT DUE TO LOOSE LUG NUTS AS OTHER LUGS ON REMAINING TIRES WERE TIGHT AND ALSO DUE TO LACK OF ALUMINUM (THERE WAS NONE) IMBEDDED ON REMAINING PART OF 1 STUD.  TIRE WAS NEVER RECOVERED.  INSPECTION OF BROKEN STUDS BY INDEPENDANT PARTY WITH BACKGROUND IN METALLURGY DETERMINED MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF FAILURE IS DUE TO IMPROPER HEAT TREATING OF STUDS.
