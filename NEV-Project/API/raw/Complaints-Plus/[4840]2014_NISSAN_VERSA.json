        "summary": "In February 2022, our 2014 Nissan Versa (which my husband purchased new in 2014) started to sputter and nearly stall upon acceleration. Today (3/14/2022) I visited Younger Nissan- a Nissan dealer in Frederick, MD where he purchased the car- for diagnosis and repair. They found that the car at 77,666 miles needs a completely new transmission, costing over $4000 in repairs.   This is a critical safety issue.  The car could have stalled at any speed, and there is no error or alarm shown on the car's dashboard indicating an issue.  This is a product defect and with no warning or alarms there was no opportunity to fix or check the issue while under still under warranty. I have been driving this unsafe vehicle for several weeks, unaware that there was a critical safety issue for myself and other drivers- this is unacceptable!   This is a known issue for Nissan.  If you Google \"2014 Nissan Versa transmission\" you will find complaint after complaint- including a class action law suit- about this issue.  It seems that Nissan knows and is trying to ignore this issue. I would appreciate if you looked into this issue with Nissan and their CVT transmission issues with their 2014 Nissan Versa models.  I also plan to contact Nissan North America, the US Department of Transportation, the Maryland State Attorney General and possibly Small Claims Court about this issue.  Please look into this so that myself and other drivers are not risking our lives driving these vehicles.  I am happy to provide you with copies of my payments etc. once the car is fixed. I had to finance the majority of the repair cost as I am sure a large majority of other drivers have had to do as well.   Thank you for any assistance and feedback.",

The transmission started slipping and then suddenly on the hey of 395 north bound it simply just wouldn't do anything it had no reaction at all right in the middle of the freeway and there I was stuck people at 65-70 miles an hour whizzing by me not to mention simi trucks.tge reason I am writing is I looked up the problem at it is a very common problem with this year and make of the car. I went to nissan here in reno nv and they will not honor the recall sayes it is because of a branded title. The car had been wrecked only damaging the front bumper. Nothing to the motor or transmission was rebuilt but because it had previously been turned in as an insurance claim nissan of reno will NOT honor the recall. Any damage that was done was cosmetic not to the motor or transmission. I would like to know if nissan should honor the recalls on my vehicle. It has 98,000 miles on it and falls under the 10 year under 120,000 miles. The service person I talked to treated me like I was dumb and pretty much pushed me out the door and told me that they don't have to honor it. I am tempted to get ahold of previous owner to see if his insurance claim had anything to do with this transmission issue. It has one complaint after another on YouTube over this very issue. Please help me I don't know what to do. Thank you.",

I called the dealer and Nissan does not offer these parts, the plastics hooks.  The only offer the WHOLE carpet with the hooks for $500 plus.   This is absurd.  This means that I need to pay $500 for TWO plastics hooks.  Remember if this hooks are not holding the mat an incident can occur. In my opinion, this is a safety issue.

ALL DSAHBOARDS LIGHTS AND ENGINE INDICATION CAME ON. LUCKILY THE CAR BEHIND ME SCREECHED TO STOP. I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON HAZARDS AND PULLED EMERGENCY BRAKE AND PUT CAR IN PARK. I TRIED TO RESTART CAR AND IT WOULDN'T START. AFTER FIVE MINUTES, THE CAR STARTED AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME. I ADVISED MY DAUGHTER AND TOLD HER I WOULD PUT CAR IN SHOP. ON 7/26/18, I TOOK CAR TO AUTO CARE FOR ASSESSMENT. MY VEHICLE HAD ONLY 31,290 MILES ON IT. THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG BUT OUT OF CONCERN, I HAD A 30,000 MILE SERVICE DONE ON CAR. ON 8/3/18, I WAS ADVISED BY ANOTHER DRIVER THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE NOT WORKING. I WENT HOME AND MY DAUGHTER SAW THAT THE LIGHTS WERE OUT ALSO. I CHECKED AS SHE BRAKED AND NO LIGHTS. I DROVE ON HAZARDS TO AUTO REPAIR AND THEY CHECKED VEHICLE AND LIGHTS WORKED. THEY STATED MAYBE AN ELECTRICAL SHORTAGE BUT RETURN IF LIGHTS GO OUT AGAIN. FROM THE TIME I PURCHASED THIS CAR BRAND NEW IN MARCH OF 2014, I HAVE TAKEN IT BACK TO NISSAN FOR LACK OF POWER, SPUTTERING AT STOPS AND INTERMITTENT STALLS. NISSAN REPLACED OXYGEN SENSOR A YEAR AGO WHEN CAR STOPPED WHILE DRIVING AND ADVISED THAT IT'S A SMALL CAR SO WON'T HAVE A LOT OF POWER. ON 8/23/18, I RECEIVED NOTICE FROM NISSAN REGARDING SUDDEN STOPS AND TO BRING CAR TO DEALER FOR REPAIR. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE OR HAVE MY GRANDCHILDREN WITH ME WHEN I DRIVE. THE CAR STUTTERS AT STOP AND HESITATION IS CONSTANT. I'M NOT SURE NISSAN CAN REPAIR THIS ISSUE.",

THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND IT NEEDS A NEW ONE AT THE COST OF $3800.00. THE CAR HAS 66,000 MILES AND IS A 2014. FILED A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN AND WAS TURNED DOWN FOR ANY HELP. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH JATCO TRANSMISSIONS, THE MANUFACTURER KNOWS IT, NISSAN KNOWS IT, MITSUBISHI & SUBARU BOTH USE THE SAME JATCO TRANSMISSION AND HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. THE ISSUES ARE WIDE SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE CAR MANUFACTURERS AND ALL OF THEM ARE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEMS. A 2014 WITH 66000 MILES SHOULD NOT NEED A TRANSMISSION.

        "summary": "WE RECENTLY (2 NOV) PURCHASED A 2014 NISSAN VERSA WITH THE 5 SPEED TRANSMISSION ,OUR PROBLEM IS WITH DOWN SHIFTING FROM 5TH TO 4TH . WHEN SHIFTING FROM 5TH TO 4TH THE SHIFTER WILL RANDOMLY LOCK UP AND YOU HAVE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PHYSICAL MOVE THE SHIFTER IN EVERY DIRECTION TILL YOU CAN SHIFT AGAIN OR IF YOU?RE LUCKY AS YOU?RE COASTING AND FIGHTING WITH THE SHIFTER IT POPS LOOSE AND  YOU CAN SHIFT INTO A LOWER GEAR.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE SHIFT LINKAGE LOCKS UP AND THE CAR WON?T GO FULLY INTO 4TH. MY WIFE HAS TAKEN OFF WORK TWICE AND ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THE CAR REPAIRED AT OUR LOCAL NISSAN DEALER (LEGLUE NISSAN, ALEXANDRIA, LA).  BOTH TIMES SHE HAS BEEN SHE TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER AFTER A SHORT TEST DRIVE NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR, ALL THE 2014 VERSAS SHIFT LIKE THAT. WE HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND RECEIVED A SIMILAR ANSWER BASICALLY THAT THEY ARE AWARE THAT  THE VERSA HAS A HARD DOWNSHIFT FROM 5TH TO 4TH BUT THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE VEHICLE.  ALSO, LET ME AT THIS TIME ALLEVIATE ANY CONCERN ABOUT US BEING UNFAMILIAR WITH THE OPERATION OF A MANUAL TRANSMISSION VEHICLE.  WE PRESENTLY OWN FOUR PASSENGER VEHICLES WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, ONE BEING A 2009 VERSA WITH THE 5 SPEED TRANSMISSION WHICH HAS NEVER GIVEN US A PROBLEM AND SEVERAL PIECES OF FARM MACHINERY AND BETWEEN BOTH OF US HAVE OVER 70 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OPERATING THEM.  *TR",
