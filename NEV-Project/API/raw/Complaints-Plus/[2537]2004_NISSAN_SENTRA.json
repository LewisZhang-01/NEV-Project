AFTER HOOKING UP A CODE SCANNER TO MY CAR THEY FOUND THE FOLLOWING CODES, P0420 (CATALYST SYSTEM EFFICIENCY BELOW THRESHOLD), P0302(CYLINDER #2 MISFIRE), P0303( CYLINDER #3 MISFIRE) DURING THE DIAGNOSIS THEY SAID THAT THE PRE-CAT (EXHAUST MANIFOLD) HAD COME APART AND THE MATERIAL INSIDE HAD GLOGGED MY EXHAUST SYSTEM AND GOTTEN SUCKED BACK INTO MY CYLINDERS AND SCORED THE CYLINDER WALLS.

I PURCHASED A NEW SENSOR AND INSTALLED IT, CLEARED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, AND CHECKED FOR ANY REMAINING CODES. NONE WERE PRESENT. I TESTED THE OLD SENSOR ACCORDING TO THE NISSAN REPAIR MANUAL'S METHOD AND IT TESTED GOOD. A DAY AFTER I REPLACED THE SENSOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN WITH THE SAME FAILURE CODE. I CALLED NISSAN AGAIN AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION TO THEM AND THEY STILL TOLD ME MY CAR WAS NOT IN THE RECALL.

SPARK PLUG WAS REMOVED AND FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY PITTED AND GROUND STRAP WAS HAMMERED CLOSED. REPLACED PLUG, VACUUMED CYLINDER AND CAR RAN FINE FOR TWO WEEKS. THE SAME PROBLEM DEVELOPED ON THE WAY TO WORK AND SPARK PLUGS WERE REMOVED AND A SECOND CYLINDER WAS FOUND TO HAVE IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS. THE PRIVATE MECHANIC I USE ADVISED ME THAT THERE WAS  A RECALL ON THIS ENGINE (REF. ABOVE). I THEN DROVE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER WHERE THEY VERIFIED THAT THE POWER VALVE WAS MISSING TWO OF EIGHT SCREWS AND THIS WAS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE CYLINDER FAILURES. FILED CLAIM WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS INFORMED BY REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE THAT MY VIN  DID NOT FALL INTO THE VIN RECALL RANGE AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE RECALL ON MY ENGINE. AS SUCH, NONE OF THE RECALL TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED ON MY ENGINE. I FEEL THAT MY EXPENSES SHOULD BE REIMBURSED AND, IF REQUIRED, MY ENGINE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE SINCE I HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED FROM THE FAILURE DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL. I'M SURE THAT THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE PISTONS, VALVES, CYLINDER WALLS, AND ENGINE HEAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAILED SPARK PLUGS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED DUE TO THE POUNDING THEY TOOK FROM THE STEEL POWER VALVE SCREWS. I BELIEVE THAT NISSAN KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM WITH OTHER VIN 2.5 LITER ENGINES AND ARE REFUSING TO FIX THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT CORPORATE LIABILITY FOR A KNOWN DEFECT IN EVEN MORE OF THEIR ENGINES. I HAVE WRITTEN TO CARLOS GHOSEN AND GIVEN NISSAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND WITH NO RESULTS TO DATE. PLEASE HELP ME OBTAIN THE SAME RIGHTS AND BENEFITS OF OTHER NISSAN OWNERS WHO FELL UNDER THE PROTECTION OF RECALL CAMPAIGN P5202. THANK YOU.  *JB",
