My car remained in this location for 3 and a half hours. The hazard lights stopped working after the first hour, making it extremely difficult to see that the vehicle was stopped. After the second hour, an officer parked behind my vehicle with their lights flashing as he said it was an extremely dangerous situation and my car was sure to be hit. He was able to get a tow truck to me before Hyundai. For  hours, numerous people were forced to brake quickly/swerve into other lane to avoid hitting my car. This occurred right before an intersection, putting 4 directions of drivers at risk of collision. I stood in the rain, near my car, attempting to help direct drivers away from the lane until the police officer showed up.   The vehicle is now at the dealership which confirmed engine failure, pending replacement. Possibly related, this vehicle had the catalytic convertor replaced 3 months prior.

I have let Hyundai know that I no longer own the vehicle. Despite multiple communications with Hyundai, they have made no indication that they would try to find the new owner and direct recall information to that party.  In the past, when this situation has occurred with other manufacturers, letting the manufacturer that I no longer owned the vehicle was sufficient and the manufacturer took over from there.  I find Hyundai's process to be unsatisfactory.  As I have not been able to redirect them to the new owner, I am taking the step of informing NHTSA.",
