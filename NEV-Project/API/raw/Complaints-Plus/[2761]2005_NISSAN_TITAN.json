The gas hand was registering a quarter of a tank of fuel so I did not think that I had run out of gas.  After being towed to the shop the mechanic checked the vehicle and said that it was just out of gas but the gas gauge was still registering 1/4 of a tank of gas.  Gas was put in the truck and it started right up.  The mechanic informed me of a recall on the 2005 nissan titans that matched what was happening to my truck.  When I informed nissan they told me there is a recall but that my vin number is not included in the recall.  I have had the same incident where the truck just shut off 2 more times now and this should be covered by the nissan recall since this is the exact problem that is happening to my truck that is stated in the recall and my truck is the exact year.  Can someone please help me to get nissan to honor this recall for my truck?  Recall ID#68290",

I DROVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY HOME AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP. WHEN I TOOK MY 2005 NISSAN TITAN TO THE DEALERSHIP IN VINELAND NEW JERSEY THEY STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK WAS THE REAR AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THEY STATED THAT THE REPAIR COST FOR THE WHOLE REAR WAS $3,800 IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE REPAIRED.  THEY STATED THAT MY TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY 2 MONTHS EVEN THOUGH I ONLY HAD 38,836 MILES ON IT. I ASKED WHY COULDN'T THE PUMPKIN IN THE REAR BE FIXED AND NISSAN STATED THEY DO NOT JUST FIX THE PUMPKIN. THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE REAR IN THE TRUCK COSTING ME $3,800.00. I CALLED [XXX] AND SPOKE TO [XXX].  [XXX] REP STATED THAT HE HAS NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM, PART (TT913A582) [XXX] POSI. [XXX] STATED TO ME THAT THEY MAKE THIS REAR FOR NISSAN.  [XXX] STATED THAT NISSAN ENGINEERS,  ENGINEER PART AND THEY ONLY MAKE IT FOR THEM.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL SHOP TO BE REPAIRED WHICH STATED THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD COST ME $1,358.90.  THE AUTO REPAIR CENTER THAT I TOOK MY NISSAN TITIAN TO, STATED THAT THERE WAS MANY MANY MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE REARS IN THE NISSAN TITANS STARTING FROM 2005 TO 2010. IT WAS ACTUALLY BEING REPORTED ONLINE SEARCH. AS I LOOKED ONLINE I COULD SEE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NISSAN TITAN REARS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.

THEN JUST LAST WEEK THE TRUCK RAN OUT OF GAS, THIS TIME ON THE FREEWAY, NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT WITH A SEMI TRUCK, WHILE SHOWING ALMOST 1/2 TANK. UPON RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THOUSANDS OF TITAN OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND NOT BEING COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  I CONTACTED THE BAR AND AFTER THEIR INVESTIGATION, THE DEALER DISCLOSED THAT ALL TITANS WERE MADE WITH THE DEFECTIVE FUEL LEVEL SENSOR, AND THAT THE DEALER WAS REPLACING THESE PARTS EVERY DAY, NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL.  TO SUM IT UP, I SPENT GOOD MONEY FOR A TRUCK THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE A SAFE VEHICLE FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY, WHICH IT IS NOT.  I'M VERY SERIOUS I WAS ALMOST KILLED WHEN IT HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY.

I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN FOR THE RECALL (AT KELLY NISSAN OF LYNNFIELD MA), NOT KNOWING THIS AND THEY SIMPLY TAPED THE WIRING HARNESSES AFTER INSPECTION AND RECORDED THE RECALL SERVICED ON THE NISSAN TITAN AND MOST LIKELY CHARGED NISSAN OF NORTH AMERICA FOR PARTS AND LABOR FOR A HARNESS REPLACEMENT.

I RESEARCHED THE FLASHING CODE FROM THE SENSOR AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE RELATED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE WIRING HARNESS.   AS RECENTLY AS 2 WEEKS AGO I RECEIVED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE FROM NISSAN OF NORTH AMERICA WHICH CLEARLY STATED THIS TIME \" IF THE RED AIRBAG WARNING LAMP IS ILLUMINATED - PLEASE CONTACT YOUR DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY FOR REPAIRS\" , AFTER SCHEDULING ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT DID THE ORIGINAL RECALL AND BRINGING THE VEHICLE IN THEY TOLD ME THAT THE RECALL HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE AND THE WAS NO OTHER ACTION THAT COULD BE PERFORMED WITHOUT A CHARGE TO ME.

I NOTICED FLUID COMING FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE. I TOOK IT TO NISSAN AND THEY INSPECTED IT. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL BEARING. I ASKED THEM TO FIX IT. THEY PUT IN A NEW PART BUT THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY DID NOT CHARGE ME FOR THAT WORK. I THEN TALKED TO THE SHOP FOREMAN OF NISSAN AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A DOWL PIN COMING LOOSE BETWEEN THE SPIDER GEARS WITHOUT PULLING THE COVER OFF OR ANYTHING. HE SAID THAT THE REAR ENDS FAIL A DIME A DOZEN WITH MODELS 2004-2007. I ASKED HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE TO FIX IT AND I WAS TOLD 3200 DOLLARS. IF NISSAN HAS KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME I THINK THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND ACTUALLY ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT. I HAVE THE TRUCK IN STORAGE RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE MILITARY, BUT I WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO COME OUT OF POCKET AND GET IT REPAIRED.  *TR",

NISSAN TOLD ME THAT THEY AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME AND IF WANTED TO GET THE TRUCK FIXED, I WOULD HAVE TO COUGH UP 4,000 DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE WHOLE REAR AXLE. BEING SO FEED UP WITH THEM, I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS JOB TO MY MECHANIC WHICH HE PROJECTED TO ONLY COST 2,100 DOLLARS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LOYAL NISSAN CUSTOMER, BUT NISSAN REALLY LOOKS OUT FOR THEIR BEST INTEREST AND NOT THEIR CUSTOMER. ONCE MY TRUCK IS FIXED, I WILL BE TRADING IT IN FOR A CHEVY SILVERADO 1500.  *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP THEN TOLD ME THEY HAD SPOKEN WITH NISSAN USA AND THEY WERE LEAVING ME WITH A $1500 BILL TO PAY.  I EXPRESSED MY EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THEIR DECISION.  I THEN CALLED CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT NISSAN TO TELL THEM WHY THEY'D BE LOSING MY BUSINESS.  SHE THEN CALLED ME BACK TO TELL ME THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING AND THAT I WAS TO COVER  THE DEALERSHIP LABOR COSTS OF $353.  I ACCEPTED HER OFFER.  ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I RECEIVED ANOTHER CALL FROM THAT SAME LADY'S SUPERVISOR CLAIMING THAT THE FIRST LADY MISINFORMED ME AND THAT I OWED $1500.  I WAS SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED AT THE SAME TIME.  I SPOKE WITH THIS \"SUPERVISOR\" FOR A WHILE TRYING TO REASON WITH HER, BUT IT WAS FUTILE.  SHE WASN'T INTERESTED IN WHAT I WAS SAYING.  I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH HER SUPERVISOR, BUT SHE INSISTED SHE WAS THE TOP DECISION MAKER.

I THEN MADE THE NEXT TURN APROX.1/2 MILE DOWN THE ROAD TO THE GAS STATION. ONCE MORE THE TRUCK POPPED WHEN TURNING. I STOPPED AND GOT OUT TO LOOK UNDER THE REAR END TO SEE IF I COULD SPOT AND DAMAGE FROM THE AREA THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM. NOTHING WAS VISIBLE. I THEN SECURED MY SON IN THE TRUCK SO WE COULD TRY TO GO HOME. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, IM GOING TO MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE PARKING LOT BEFORE GETTING OUT ON THE HIGHWAY. I PUT THE TRUCK IN GEAR AND HAD MADE IT ABOUT 20 FT WHEN I FELT AND HEARD THE REAR TIRES LOCK THEN RELEASE TWICE. I QUICKLY PARKED, POPPING 2 OR3 TIME WHILE TURNING TO MAKE THE PARKING SPACE. I THEN CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK. AFTER WAITING 21/2HRS I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE NEAREST NISSAN DEALERSHIP. THE NEXT DAY I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO FOLLOW UP ON THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS RECEIVE A CALL BEFORE ANY REPAIRS WERE DONE. APPROX.. 3HRS LATER I RECEIVED A CALL STATING THAT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAD GONE OUT AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT THIS WAS A OEM PART AND THAT THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY HAD TO BE PURCHASED. THE INDIVIDUAL PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO THE TRUCK BEING NEWER. TOTAL COST FOR PARTS AND LABOR 3,700 DOLLARS PLUS TAX. THEN TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE I FOUND OUT THAT THE PARTS HAD TO BE SHIPPED IN. WITH THE WEEKEND IN THE NEAR FUTURE I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD TAKE A WEEK TO GET THE PARTS AND HAVE TO TRUCK UP AND GOING. I AM CURRENTLY GETTING A SECOND OPINION. DID I MENTION THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN MADE THE FIRST PAYMENT ON THIS TRUCK?!! THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAFE BUYING A TRUCK WITH ONLY 68,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",

AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL PULSATED A LOT WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES.  I NEVER LEAVE MY FOOT ON OR RIDE THE BRAKE PEDAL NOR DO I USE THE BRAKES EXCESSIVELY, MOST OF THE MILES ON THE VEHICLE ARE HIGHWAY MILES BECAUSE THE TRUCK IS USED MOSTLY FOR VACATION PURPOSES.  I DO HOWEVER TOW A SMALL 6 BY 12 FOOT BOX TRAILER WITH 4 BICYCLES IN IT, WHICH MAKES FOR A LIGHT LOAD.  IT HAS CONTINUED TO PROGRESS AND BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED AS THE VEHICLE AGES.  AT AROUND 13,000 MILES THE BRAKES SOMETIMES GRAB OR WOULD NOT STOP WITH OUT APPLYING EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL MUCH MORE THAN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NEW, THIS WOULD BRING THE TRUCK TO A SHAKING, ROUGH OR SOMETIMES TIRE SQUEALING STOP.  AT 13,300 I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF THEY COULD CORRECT THIS PROBLEM, THEY SAID THEY COULD TRY MACHINING THE ROTORS FOR AROUND $440 OR REPLACE THE ROTORS WHICH WOULD COST QUITE A BIT MORE, HOWEVER THE REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THE TRUCK STILL HAS THE SAME PROBLEM WITH 14,991 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  I FEEL IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ROTORS IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IT SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE OUT OF ABOUT 10 NEW VEHICLES THAT I PURCHASED WHICH HAS BRAKE PROBLEMS. *TR",

THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED JUST AROUND 50,000 MILES ON MY 2005 NISSAN TITAN, WHICH IS VERY SURPRISING FOR ANY VEHICLE WITH THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF MILEAGE. I HAVE FOUND ON OTHER WEBSITES THAT HUNDREDS OF OTHER TITAN OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH LEAKING REAR AXLE SEALS, WITH MILEAGE AS LOW AS 8,000 MILES, 25,000 MILES, 40,000 MILES; YET STILL, NISSAN CONTINUES TO IGNORE THIS PROBLEM, AS FAR AS A RECALL IS CONCERNED. THIS PROBLEM IS VERY COSTLY TO BE CORRECTED, RANGING FROM $1,000 TO AS HIGH AS $3,000, DEPENDING ON THE DEALER'S ESTIMATION.

WHAT CAUSED THIS FAILURE IS THE TAIL PIPE CAME LOOSE DUE TO RUST AND THE HEAT FROM THE EXHAUST BURNED THE ELECTRICAL WIRING THAT WAS PLACED ALONGISDE THE EXHAUST CAUSING THE ENGINE COMPUTER TO  MALFUNCTION.    WE HAD TO PAY $1,300.00 TO GET THE VEHICLE REPAIRED NOT INCLUDING ONE NIGHT HOTEL STAY AND RENTING A CAR BACK HOME BECAUSE THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR A FEW DAYS AND HAVING TO DRIVE BACK UP TO PICK UP THE TRUCK WITH THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND BRING THEM ALL BACK HOME.  THE DISTANCE IS 156 MILES FROM WHERE IT BROKE DOWN TO WHERE WE LIVE.    I BELIEVE THERE'S A DESIGN FLAW THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, SERVICE MANAGER IN WILKES BARRE ACKNOWLEDGED SEVERAL OTHER TITANS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN THERE IS AN EXHAUST LEAK AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL NISSAN SERVICE MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED THE SAME.

AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION I DETERMINED THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM WAS TO INSTALL THE WHOLE REAR END ASSEMBLY INCLUDING HOUSING, GEARS, AND AXLES COSTING $3100 AT THE NISSAN DEALER.

I QUICKLY RETURN TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT, FOR SERVICING. THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP REPAIRED THE ROTORS.

I RETURNED THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SAME PROBLEM ON SEVERAL OTHER OCCASIONS, DURING THE SUMMER OF 2007 ODOR REAPPEARED; THEY REPLACED THE RUBBER GASKET AROUND DOOR WINDOWS IN HOPES OF RESOLVING THE ISSUE. MEANWHILE THE FRONT BRAKES ROTORS WERE REPLACED AGAIN AND THE GAUGES (FUEL, OIL, TACH ,VOLTMETER) ACTING ERRATICALLY. THE DEALERSHIP REPAIRED THE BRAKES UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY & PRORATED MY PURCHASE OF A NEW NISSAN AUTO BATTERY; ACCORDING TO SERVICE DEPT. THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE GAUGES MALFUNCTION. THEN AGAIN IN2008, I WAS TOLD THE BRAKES WERE NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AND THAT THE MUSTY ODOR WAS CAUSED BY WATER COMING INTO THE CABIN VIA A SMALL VOID IN THE WINDOW SEALANT AROUND THE \"FACTORY INSTALLED WINDSHIELD' UPON HEARING THIS, I CHOSE TO TAKE MY TRUCK TO ANOTHER MECHANIC DUE TO NISSAN MECHANIC INABILITY TO RESOLVE THE BRAKE ISSUE & LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE WATER. THIS YEAR 2009, THE REAR END WAS REPAIRED DUE THE SEALS LEAKING ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND PREVENTIVE REPLACEMENT ON THE PASSENGER SEALS. HOWEVER, A FEW OLD ISSUES ALONG WITH NEW ONES THAT STILL EXIST. MY NEW MECHANIC TOLD ME THE SOURCE OF THE WATER & ODOR ISSUE IS THE A/C CONDENSER LEAKING INTO THE CABIN, THE BLINKING AIR BAG INDICATOR LIGHT WAS DUE TO A HARNESS NEEDING REPLACING IN THE REAR DOORS. *TR",

I AM THE OWNER OF A 2005 NISSAN TITAN PICK-UP TRUCK PURCHASED NEW IN JANUARY 2005.  THE VEHICLE HAS 78,000 MILES, IS WELL MAINTAINED, AND MAINLY USED TO COMMUTE TO WORK. IT IS NOT DRIVEN OFF-ROAD, NOR IT IS USED TO CARRY HEAVY LOADS. A SHACKLE SUPPORTING THE LEFT REAR SUSPENSION LEAF SPRING ASSEMBLY FAILED. THE ASSEMBLY COLLAPSED, PERFORATING THE TRUCK BED AS SHOWN ON THE ENCLOSED PHOTOS.  [?FORTUNATELY?, IT OCCURRED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND NOT WHILE DRIVING ON A PUBLIC ROAD; OTHERWISE THE CONSEQUENCES COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC DUE TO THE LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL].  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE NISSAN DEALER (1-860-448-0050).   THE TECHNICIAN INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT-OF-WARRANTY; THEREFORE, HE HAD TO CONTACT NISSAN CORPORATION FOR INSTRUCTIONS.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY FOR RUST (60 MONTHS-UNLIMITED MILES).  FURTHERMORE, SUCH A MAJOR STRUCTURAL FAILURE IS BEYOND ANY WARRANTY COVERAGE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO OCCUR.  THE VEHICLE HAS FAILED, WITHIN FOUR YEARS, TO PROVIDE ONE OF ITS MAJOR INTENDED AND IMPLIED USES, WHICH IS TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO ITS OPERATOR AND PASSENGERS IN A SAFE MANNER AND FURTHERMORE, NOT POSE A RISK WHEN OPERATED ON THE ROADS BY EXPOSING OTHER DRIVERS AND PROPERTY TO INJURY AND DAMAGE.  OTHER NISSAN TITAN OWNERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  NISSAN WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM SINCE IT BEEFED-UP THE SHACKLES ON THEIR 2008 MODELS, BUT OLDER MODELS STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM.

TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP BUT THEY WOULDN'T COVER UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO AFTERMARKET LIFT (EVEN THOUGH THEY SELL A VERSION OF MY TRUCK WITH THIS LIFT INSTALLED BY THE FACTORY).

JANUARY 07 - WHILE IN MEXICO, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING 4WD ON HARD PACKED SAND.  I HEARD A LOUD BANG AND WHEN I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK I FOUND THAT THE SAME SHAFT WAS OUT AGAIN. TURNS OUT THE SHAFT HAS SPLINES AND A SMALL CIRCLIP TO HOLD IT IN PLACE.  THE CIRCLIP IS UNDERSIZED SO IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT 1 POUND OF FORCE TO SEPARATE THE 2 PIECES.  THIS MOST RECENT TIME OCCURRED UNDER LOAD SO WHEN THE SHAFT SHOT OUT, THE SPLINES GOT DAMAGED.  SINCE I WAS A DAY'S DRIVE SOUTH OF THE BORDER I HAD TO FILE AND THEN HAMMER THE SHAFT BACK INTO PLACE. NISSAN DENIED MY WARRANTY, AGAIN  BLAMING THE LIFT FOR THE PROBLEM. I FOUND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, MOST WITHOUT LIFTS.  I TALKED TO A TECHNICIAN AT A NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN OREGON AND HE CONFIRMED THAT HE HAS SEEN SEVERAL FRONT DIFFERENTIALS WITH THIS PROBLEM. HE SUSPECTED THAT THE CV JOINTS DON'T STRETCH AS WELL WHEN WEATHER IS COLD THEREBY PULLING THE STUB SHAFTS OUT WHEN THE WHEELS ARE TURNED.  MOST VEHICLES HE HAD SEEN WERE STOCK.  HE ALSO SAID THAT NISSAN HAD A REDESIGNED DIFFERENTIAL THAT THE TECH'S ARE SUPPOSED TO INSTALL WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  I CONTACTED NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A FACTORY REP.
