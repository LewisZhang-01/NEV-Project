HOWEVER, THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE (PER THE DEALERSHIP) IS MISSING ANY TYPE OF SELF-LEVELLING SUSPENSION SYSTEM.      THIS MIS-BUILD MEANS THAT - WHEN A TRAILER IS CONNECTED - THE HEADLIGHTS POINT UPWARDS INSTEAD OF FRONT AND/OR SLIGHTLY DOWN TO SHOW THE ROAD CONDITIONS, WHICH MAKES THAT ALONE A SAFETY HAZARD.  UPWARD LIGHTS MAY ALSO IMPACT ONCOMING TRAFFIC BY BLINDING OTHER DRIVERS.  MY HUSBAND INFORMS ME THERE ARE OTHER SAFETY CONCERNS THAT GO ALONG WITH THIS, BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE PHYSICS OF HOW TOWED VEHICLES OPERATE SO I CANNOT EXPLAIN FURTHER HOW MY SAFETY, AND POSSIBLY OTHERS, ARE RISKED WHEN TOWING A LOAD WITH THIS VEHICLE OR OTHERS MIS-BUILT LIKE IT.  THE DEALERSHIP PURCHASED MY VEHICLE BACK FROM ME AND IT REMAINS ON THEIR LOT TODAY INSTEAD OF BEING SOLD AT AUCTION AS STATED.      I FOUND THAT ANOTHER VEHICLE (2 YEARS NEWER, BUT SAME MFG) WAS MIS-BUILT WITHOUT ITS TOWING SUSPENSION SYSTEM.  I REPORTED BOTH ISSUES TO THE DEALERSHIPS.  IN THE CASE OF THE POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT VEHICLE, I SIMPLY DID NOT BUY IT.  I REPORTED BOTH INSTANCES DIRECTLY TO THE MFG AND WAS TOLD THAT WAS AN ISSUE FOR WHICH THE DEALERSHIPS WERE RESPONSIBLE.    I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS MFG HAS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH A PARTICULAR BUILD OF VEHICLE AND IS IGNORING POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUES.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THEIR DEALERSHIPS ARE ALSO IGNORING THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF FIXING IT.  I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN ME TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND, IF NECESSARY, GET THE PROBLEMS RESOLVED TO INCLUDE FURTHER REMUNERATION TO ME AS APPLICABLE.
