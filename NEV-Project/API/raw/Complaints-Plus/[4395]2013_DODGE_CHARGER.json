The failure of the timing components resulted in warped values, bent push rods and catastrophic engine failure. This left me sitting in my car on the side of the interstate for several hours in the dark. There were no warning lamps or any problems with how the engine had operated before it suddenly died. All parts that have been removed from the car have been kept for inspection. There is a recall for the same OEM timing components failing and causing sudden engine failure for  2009-2012 Dodge Chargers. Dodge used the same timing tensioner, timing arm guide, and timing chains in Chargers built from 2009 to 2019. Why would the recall be extended to all years that used these parts. If they had recalled all the years those parts were used my car engine would not quit suddenly at 80mph and I have to coast across three lanes of traffic or sit in the emergency for hours waiting on a ride. .",

Removed and a pool of gas on top of driver side fuel pump. Researched online and found several charger challenger Chrysler owners with the same exact issues. I also found where a minor accident caused the death of 4 people car went up in flames. My kids sit in this back seat and it is very very alarming. I'm surprised that there is no recall on this as of yet. It's a well known issue amongst owner just Google fuel pooling on fuel pump.  Shoot there's even a manufacturer making reinforced covers so this doesn't happen. What happens is the weight from sitting in the back seat smashes on the covers and the connectors causing the plastic fuel pump to crack after a while also possibly damaging the connectors. This is a very expensive fix it not deadly. The car almost becomes not drivable. I hope this gets addressed and all owners receive compensation.",

CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING - NOW BEING TOLD THAT IT MAY BE THE P60 RECALL, BUT WE CAN'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET IT TO THE DEALERSHIP - WHO - COINCIDENTALLY HAS NO APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR A WEEK, DOES NOT PROVIDE LOANER CARS (OR FREE RENTAL), AND MAY OR MAY NOT COVER THE TOWING.

I WOULD GET THE PROBLEM FIXED, BUT THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT IT IS OVER $1000 TO GET FIXED. NOW MY MOTHER DRIVES MY CAR SOMETIMES, AND SHE HAS A PROBLEM WITH DRIVING MY CAR BECAUSE OF THIS, SO SHE DOES NOT DRIVE IT ANYMORE. THIS ISSUE COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE IT CAN LOCK UP AND CAUSE A BAD ACCIDENT, KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING CONSIDERING HOW NEW THE VEHICLE IS AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIX IT DURING WARRANTY BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS NOT CONSISTENT.

I ASKED IF THEY HAD ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE RECALL, TO WHICH THEY INDICATED THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT IT, BUT DID NOT HAVE ANY NEW INFORMATION EITHER.  THEY OFFERED TO LOAD TEST MY BATTERY, WHICH WAS FINE, INDICATING THAT I COULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR.  LATER IN THE DAY ON FEB 2, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM CHRYSLER ASSISTANCE INDICATING THAT MY COMPLAINT HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THEIR SPECIAL TRACKING DEPARTMENT, AND THAT ONCE THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, I WOULD BE NOTIFIED.    I WOULD LIKE NHTSA TO LOOK INTO WHY CHRYSLER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARRANGE EITHER A BETTER PART OR AN ALTERNATE SOLUTION TO REMEDY THE RECALL.

THEY SAID THERE IS NO REMEDY YET BUT THEY WILL PUT A NEW DEFECTIVE ALTERNATOR ON MY CAR LEAVING ME IN THE SAME SITUATION IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS RESOLVED.  I FEEL THE CAR SHOULD BE REPLACED AT THEIR EXPENSE AS IT IS NO LONGER SAFE IN MY OPINION FOR ME TO DRIVE WITH CHILDREN BECAUSE WE WERE ALMOST KILLED YESTERDAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED THERE WAS NO WARNING IT JUST WENT DOWN.  DODGE WILLNOT GIVE ME A RENTAL CAR SINCE I AM 900 MILES OVER WARRANTY BUT THIS IS A RECALL SO IM STUCK WITH NO CAR AND EVEN WHEN I GET IT BACK IT IS STILL DEFECTIVE.  PLEASE HELP!  *TR",
