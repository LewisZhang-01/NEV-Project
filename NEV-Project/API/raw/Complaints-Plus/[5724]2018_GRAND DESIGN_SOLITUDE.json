        "summary": "From factory, vehicle standard build weight of this trailer (nothing loaded) is; 14,200 lbs. Trailer is a two axle design, with each axle rated at 7,000 lbs. Total load allowed by their specifications is 14,000 lbs. Before I add any items normally carried in a travel trailer (food, clothing, etc.) I am already over the axle rating. On a trip with with normally carried items and approximately 20 gallons of water in a fresh water tank (capacity is 54 gallons) I had two tires blow out on two separate roads. (one tire each side about 25 miles apart) Factory now offers upgraded axles of 8,000 lbs. each, bringing axle load capacity to 16,000 lbs. I was unable to determine why the tires failed as they shredded beyond any recovery of the tire structure. Tires were 235/85 R 16 in size, load range 'G' and trailer rated. They were inflated to 110 lbs. as directed by the sidewall. My concern is with the possible defective design of the axles, which may have contributed to the tire failure. Overheated bearings, poor load distribution, unknown at this time.",

TOWED THE UNIT HOME 400 MILES AND DECIDED TO CONTACT LIPPERT, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE AXLES AND BRAKES. I WAS GIVEN A CLAIM NUMBER TO INSPECT THE BRAKES. DUE TO OWNING A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, I WAS ALLOWED TO PERFORM THE INSPECTION MYSELF. WHAT I FOUND WAS NO ISSUE ON THE TWO HUBS AND BRAKES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE UNIT, BRAKES CONTAMINATED WITH GREASE ON THE TWO RIGHT HAND HUBS. GREASE WAS ON THE MAGNETS, INSIDE OF THE DRUM BRAKING SURFACES AND MAGNET SURFACE. LIPPERT AGREED TO SEND ME 2 NEW BACKING PLATES WITH BRAKES, AND TWO NEW GREASE SEALS, PLUS PAY TWO HOURS OF LABOR. ALL OF THIS IS GREAT, BUT IF I HAD BEEN IN A PANIC STOP SITUATION, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THIS VEHICLE.",
