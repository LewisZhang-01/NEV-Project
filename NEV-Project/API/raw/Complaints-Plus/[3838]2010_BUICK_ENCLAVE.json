I HAVE VIDEO OF THE CAR DOING THIS WEIRD ACCELERATION AND ALL DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT [XXX] KEPT SAYING THE VEHICLE WAS FINE.   WELL, I WAS STRANDED BECAUSE IT JUST STOPPED A FEW DAYS AGO AND HAD TO TAKE A 50.00 UBER HOME.   I HAVE HAD TO UBER 3 TIMES NOW AND PURCHASED A CODE READER.  THE CODE COMES BACK AS A TIMING CHAIN STRETCHED.  IT SEEMS WHAT I WAS FEELING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS IN FACT THIS ISSUE.  I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.  I HAVE HAD TO RENT VEHICLES FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS AND WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO MY HOME TOMORROW.  SINCE THIS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION FROM DAY ONE I EXPECT IT TO BE REPAIRED AT NO COST TO ME AND SOME OF THE CHARGES I HAVE ACCUMULATED BE REIMBURSED.  THIS IS NOT JUST!  I WILL BE LOOKING INTO THE LEMON LAW AND IF IT APPLIES TO ME.  I AM HOPING YOUR COMPANY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY.  HAD THEY PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT I WAS SAYING AND ALL THEN THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED,. THE STRESS AND ISSUES THIS HAS CAUSED GOES SO MUCH DEEPER THAN THIS   THE CODE THAT COMES BACK IS P0008.  THE CRANK SHAFT.  I HAVE READ NUMEROUS REVIEWS ON THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY THIS ON. FURTHERMORE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RECENT ISSUES WITH THE POWER STEERING AS WELL.

THIS MAY NOT SEEM UNUSUAL, BUT THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR THE SAME ISSUE, P0008 WHICH IS A STRETCHED TIMING CHAIN ISSUE. THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE COMMON WITH THE 3.6L VVT ENGINE THAT IS SHARED ACROSS ALL MODELS. MY WIFE AND CHILD WERE IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME AND WERE ABOUT TO BE HIT BY ON COMING TRAFFIC. LUCKILY, THE VEHICLE COMING TOWARD THEM WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. THE VEHICLE BLOCKED TRAFFIC FOR SEVERAL HOURS. THE DESCRIBED PROBLEM IS A STRETCHED TIMING CHAIN, BUT MY RESEARCH HAS ELUDED THAT GM HAS HAD THIS SAME ISSUE WITH MULTIPLE MODELS OVER MULTITUDES OF MODEL YEAR VEHICLES. THIS ISSUE OFTEN LEADS TO A HEFTY REPAIR BILL UPWARDS OF $3500 OR EVEN MORE. IN MY OPINION WITH MULTIPLE REPORTS OF THIS VEHICLE OR MODELS THAT SHARE THE SAME ENGINE, THE PROBLEM CAN LEAD TO POSSIBLE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR A DEAD STOP WHILE DRIVING. A VEHICLE COULD POSSIBLY BE ON ICY, WET, ROAD CONDITIONS AND COULD CAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF MORE INJURIES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO FOR MODEL YEARS FROM 2008 - 2020. THE ENGINE HAS NOT CHANGED. THIS ENGINE IS NOT ONLY SHARED WITH THE BUICK ENCLAVE, BUT THE CHEVY TRAVERSE, GMC ACADIA, BUICK LACROSSE, AND THE LIST GOES ON. DUE TO THE TIMING CHAIN FAILURE, MY FAMILY COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT OR WORSE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THE DESIGN ISSUE. I'M GLAD THAT MY FAMILY IS OK. NOW, I HAVE A HEFTY $3500 REPAIR THAT I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF FOR A CAR THAT I STILL OWE MONEY ON. GM NEEDS TO GET IN FRONT OF THIS AND PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF RELIEF FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. GM KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE. IN 2011 GM RELEASED CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 10287 WHICH DIDN'T WORK THEN IN 2012 GM RELEASED A SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT (#11340C) EVEN WHEN PROPER OIL CHANGES ARE DONE. PLEASE LOOK INTO",

NO ISSUES WHEN TRACKING STRAIGHT AHEAD.  AGAIN - A REAL SAFETY HAZARD PARTICULARLY IF TURNING IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND IT WERE TO QUIT AND IT DELAYS YOUR TURN TIME.SAME IF TURNING TO MERGE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC- LOSS OF STEERING COULD DELAY YOUR ABILITY TO MERGE AND RESULT IN A REAR END COLLISION.

HAD BEEN HAPPENING FOR A YEAR AND HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 5 TIMES, THIS LAST TIME THEY HAD IT FOR 7 WEEKS AND REQUIRED GM TECH CENTER SUPPORT TO FINALLY GET IT FIXED. THIS WAS NOT ONLY A SAFETY ISSUE BUT ALSO A FIRE HAZARD. FOLLOWING IS THE FIX: NEC TO CHECK OTHER DATA CIRCUITS THAT MIGHT BACK FEED INTO HIGH SPEED CIRCUIT. FOUND CIRCUIT #6060 BACK FEEDING IN TO CIRCUIT 2500 CAUSING ITERMITTENT COMMUNICATION LOSS. FOUND CIRCUIT OVERLOAD AT CONTACT POINT G110. WAS SERVING AS A CONTACT POINT FOR NINE CIRCUITS AND OVERHEATING, CAUSING HIGH RESISTANCE AND LOSS OF DATA COMMUNICATION AT TIMES. NECESSARY TO SEPARATE INTO 2 CONTACT POINTS TO REDUCE LOAD AND PREVENT OVERHEATING AND HIGH RESISTANCE THAT WAS CAUSING DATA CIRCUIT BACKFEEDING AND DATA LOSS. THEY SHOWED ME THE CIRCUIT WITH THE 9 WIRES THAT THEY REMOVED AND IT WAS ALL MELTED AND BURNT. NOT ONLY DID THE DRASTIC AND SUDDEN REDUCTION OF POWER CREATE A VERY UNSAFE SITUATION THE OVERHEATING OF THE CIRCUIT, BURNING AND MELTING OF WIRES CREATED A HUGE FIRE POTENTIAL.",

I STOPPED AT HOLZHAUER MOTORS IN CHEROKEE, IOWA (AUTHORIZED DEALER) WHERE I HAD THE POWER STEERING PUMP & RACK AND PINION REPLACED AND STATED THAT MY AIR CONDITIONER WAS DRAINING IN MY CAR. THE SERVICE ADVISOR PULLED THE CAR IN THE SHOP AND STATED THAT THERE WAS A KINK IN THE HOSE AND THIS KINK HAD HAPPENED WHEN THEY REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP & THE RACK AND PINION. ON THAT VISIT THE SERVICE ADVISOR STATED THAT IT HAD BEEN FIXED.   ON JANUARY 11, 2016 I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR A SCHEDULED LUBE OIL & FILTER CHANGE. I STATED TO THE SERVICE ADVISER THAT I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FAN NOT WANTING TO BLOW ANY HOT AIR. AND IT GETS VERY COLD IN IOWA IN JANUARY. I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE MOTOR. BECAUSE IT IS NOT SAFE TO TRAVEL IN THE DEAD OF WINTER WITHOUT HEAT I HAD TO HAVE THE MOTOR REPLACED JANUARY 13, 2016.  AND AS OF TODAY, JUNE 27, 2016, MY AIR CONDITIONER CONTINUES TO DRAIN IN MY CAR LEAVING ME EXPOSED TO MOLDY CONDITIONS IN MY CAR, DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF EXTREMELY HOT CONDITIONS COMBINED WITH A WET FLOOR.  TODAY, JUNE 27, 2016 AROUND 11:30 AM I SAT AT A STOP LIGHT AND LISTENED TO MY FAN DIE. I TRIED TAKING IT OFF OF THE \"AUTO\" CONTROL AND RESET THE TEMPERATURE TO THE LOWEST I CAN GET IT (CURRENTLY 69 DEGREES) AND THE FAN ON AS HIGH AS IT CAN BE. THERE IS NO COOL AIR.  AT 3:30 PM TODAY I STOPPED AT HOLZHAUER MOTORS IN CHEROKEE, IOWA THAT \"REPAIRED\" THE KINK IN THE A/C HOSE SHORTLY AFTER JUNE 17, 2015 AND REPLACED THE MOTOR ON JANUARY 13, 2016 AND NO ONE IN SERVICE WAS AVAILABLE TO VISIT WITH ME ABOUT CORRECTING THESE ISSUES.",

HAD TO PUT THE 100 MILE SPARE TIRE ON 2ND FLAT BECAUSE THESE TIRES WERE OUT OF STOCK IN SE MICHIGAN AND EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE WAS 1/21/2011.  WENT TO DEALER (SELLERS IN FARMINGTON HILLS) AND THEY LOCATED 1 TIRE AND REPLACED IT ON 1/6 WITH ANOTHER MICHELIN/ ORIGINAL TIRES.  NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE AND DIDN'T HIT ANY POT HOLES ETC. SINCE I HAD PURCHASED AN INSURANCE POLICY ON TIRES AND RIMS THESE WERE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE.  HOWEVER, ON THE 2ND INCIDENT I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THE TIMING BEING SO CLOSE TO THE FIRST TIRE ISSUE, SELLERS HAD TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE DESCRIPTION TO GET THE INSURANCE TO COVER THE TIRE.  THEY ASKED ME IF IT WAS OK TO PUT IN THAT I HIT A POT HOLE WHICH I AGREED TO HOWEVER WHEN I GOT THE INVOICE IT SAID I HAD HIT A LARGE POT HOLE.  SINCE THIS DID NOT SET WELL WITH ME I WENT ON LINE THIS WEEKEND TO FIND WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING OR EXPERIENCING.  THERE ARE ALOT OF REPORTS OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS TIRE AND ITS PROBLEMS. I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE TAKING THIS CAR LONG DISTANCES.  AS FAR AS ANY OTHER TIRES GOING I WILL INSIST THAT THEY BE REPLACED WITH ANY BRAND.  I SAW ONE CASE WHERE THE PERSON LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR IN A BLOW OUT LUCKILY HE WAS OK.  THESE TIRES DO NOT DO WELL ON SNOW EITHER.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE.  *TR",
