IT IDENTIFIES A PROBLEM OF OIL TRANSFERRING FROM THE MOTORCYCLE'S TRANSMISSION TO THE PRIMARY CHAIN CASE RESULTING IN BELOW MINIMUM REQUIRED OIL VOLUME IN THE TRANSMISSION AND TOO MUCH OIL IN THE PRIMARY CHAINCASE. INADEQUATE OIL VOLUME IN THE TRANSMISSION CAN RESULT IN TRANSMISSION DAMAGE/FAILURE THAT COULD RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RIDER (I.E. A CRASH). HARLEY-DAVIDSON STATES IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL FOR THE MOTORCYCLE 'DO NOT OVERFILL THE PRIMARY CHAINCASE WITH LUBRICANT.  OVERFILLING CAN CAUSE ROUGH CLUTCH ENGAGEMENT, INCOMPLETE DISENGAGEMENT, CLUTCH DRAG AND/OR DIFFICULTY IN FINDING NEUTRAL AT ENGINE IDLE'. THESE CONDITIONS COULD ALSO PRODUCE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RIDER SUCH AS BEING UNABLE TO DISENGAGE THE CLUTCH WHEN TRYING TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP.    THE TA0022 OFFERS NO SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM ON 2017 AND NEWER VEHICLES AND ADVISERS DEALERS ONLY TO 'CHECK THE PRIMARY AND TRANSMISSION OIL LEVELS AND ADJUST THE OIL VOLUMES AS NEEDED.  VERIFY OIL LEVELS AGAIN IN 1,600KM (1,000 MI)'. THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN IF A CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THEN TAKES THE MOTORCYCLE TO A DEALER. CUSTOMERS MUST LEARN OF THE PROBLEM FROM SOME SOURCE OTHER THAN HARLEY-DAVIDSON AS HARLEY-DAVIDSON HAS NOT NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS OF THE PROBLEM OR TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A DEALER.     IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON OWNER'S MANUAL STATES THAT TRANSMISSION OIL ONLY NEEDS TO BE CHANGED EVERY 20,000 MILES. CLEARLY, HARLEY-DAVIDSON EXPECTED THAT ADEQUATE OIL VOLUME WOULD REMAIN IN THE TRANSMISSION FOR THAT AMOUNT OF USAGE.    ENCLOSED IS A COPY OF THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON TECHNICAL ADVISORY TA0022.",
