ONCE HOME I CHECKED FOR LEAKS AND NONE WERE FOUND BUT COOLANT WAS BACK TO MIN MARK. AT NO TIME DURING THE TRIP DID THE TRUCK OVERHEAT OR RUN ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN NORMAL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT OUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AND AFTER THEY INSPECTED I WAS TOLD THAT THE TURBO HAD GONE SOUTH CAUSING AN OVER BOOST CONDITION THAT THEN ENTERED INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND CAUSED THE HEAD GASKETS TO FAIL. THEN I WAS TOLD THAT AS THE HEAD GASKETS HAD FAILED PRESSURE FROM THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER HAD ENTERED INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM BOOSTING PRESSURE BEYOND WHAT THE PRESSURE RELIEF CAP WAS RATED FOR ON THE DEGAS(OVER FLOW) BOTTLE AND SPEWED ANTI FREEZE OUT OF THE BOTTLE, WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE SMELLING.

THE MECHANIC PULLED THE \"OASIS\" REPORT AND FOUND NO RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE BASED ON THE \"VIN\".  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD WITH NO SATISFACTION.  I WAS ADVISED TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE A RECALL AT A FUTURE DATE, AT WHICH POINT I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.  AGAIN, THIS DEFECT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS DESCRIBED IN RECALL 05B27.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN WHAT HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE AND WHAT FORD TRIED TO STEM WITH THE RECALL.  IT IS AN ADMITTED ENGINEERING DEFECT WHICH SHOULD GIVE CAUSE FOR AN EXPANDED RECALL. *TR",

OVER 2 MONTHS IN THE SHOP.    THEY CHANGED THE OIL PRIOR TO DIAGNOSING BLOWN HEAD GASKETS AND OVER BOOSTING TURBO, SO THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM IF WATER WAS IN THE OIL PAN. DIAGNOSES WAS TO REPLACE THE HEAD BOLTS, GASKETS, EGR COOLER, REBUILD AN OVER BOOSTING TURBO, AT A COST OF ABOUT $3,000.00. AFTER THE HEADS WERE DEEMED UNUSABLE, MUCH PITTING, CORROSION OF THE HEAD WHERE THE CYLINDER IMPRINT IS LOCATED, THE COST WENT TO $7,5000. SINCE THEY FAILED TO INSPECT THE OIL FOR COOLANT, I HAD LITTLE ALTERNATIVE THAN TO REQUEST AN ENTIRE ENGINE, AT A COST OF $15,500.00.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SEARCH BLOWN HEAD GASKETS FORD F250 ON GOOGLE TO FIND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE EXTREMELY HOT EXHAUST GASES GET RECIRCULATION INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, BUT FIRST IT HAS TO BE COOLED.  WHEN THE COOLER FAILS, ALL THE WATER FROM YOUR ENGINE GOES OUT THE EXHAUST, THROUGH THE TURBO (BYE BYE TURBO), THEN YOU ARE PUMPING EXTREMELY HOT GASES BACK INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WHICH BOILS THE WATER, CREATING EXTREMELY HIGH PRESSURES, WHICH LIFTS THE HEADS AND BLOWS THE HEAD GASKETS.  WHAT KIND OF STUPID DESIGN IS THAT?  NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THOSE DESIGN PROBLEMS?  I NOW HAVE A $50,000 BOAT ANCHOR, WHICH IS NOT WORTH REPAIR.  HELP PLEASE!!!!!! *TR",

I'VE TAKEN THE TRUCK TO A SERVICE CENTER AND 3 OR MORE TIMES THEY'VE TAKEN IT APART AND CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.  THEY SUGGESTED TAKING IT TO A FORD DEALER.  I DID AND EXPLAINED IT TO THE MECHANIC UPON WHICH HE CLAIMS HE'S NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  AS A LAST RESORT I GOOGLED FORD 250 SHAKY STEERING AND FOUND WHAT THEY CALL \"FORD DEATH WOBBLE\".  TO MY SURPRISE THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER ACCOUNTS OF THIS WITH PEOPLE AS CONFUSED AS MYSELF AND MY MECHANICS.  FROM READING IT APPEARS THAT FORD IS AWARE BUT DENIES THE EXISTENCE OF THIS HAPPENING.

I HAVE A MECHANIC WHOM I REGULARLY USE AND HE HAS STATED TO ME THAT HE IS AWARE OF NO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE FORDS THAT HE HAS PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM FIRST HAND.  THIS SHOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE A RECALL.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ENGINE FIRE.  AT FIRST I BELIEVED THE NOISE WAS PROBABLY FROM A   BLOWN EXHAUST GASKET.

NOW I REALIZE THAT I ALSO PLACED MYSELF IN HARMS WAY PUTTING MYSELF UNDER THE HOOD TRYING TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE. WHAT IF THAT VAPOR HAD IGNITED WHILE I WAS PEEKING AROUND IN THE ENGINE?  THIS IS A SERIOUS HAZARD. I DON'T CARE WHAT FORD SAYS OR WHAT SILLY EXCUSE THEY CAN MAKE FOR THIS.  THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON WHY A SPARK PLUG SHOULD BE BLOWING OUT OF AN ENGINE LIKE THIS.

THIS IS A HISTORY OF OUR PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRUCK:  ON 8/23/04, ENGINE IDLE LOW AND RUNS ROUGH AND THE DEALER REPLACED THE EBP SENSOR.    ON 9/2/04, THE DEALER AGAIN REPLACED THE EBP SENSOR AND THE TRUCK CONTINUES TO RUN ROUGH AND SURGE DURING IDLE.  ON 9/9/04, WE SPOKE WITH THE MECHANTIC TO TELL HIM WE WERE STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.*AK    ON 1/4/05, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF WHILE WE WERE DRIVING.  THE TRUCK FINALLY STARTED AND WE TOOK IT TO AUTO WAY FORD AND WAS KEPT THERE FOR 7 DAYS.  THEY REPLACED THE INJECTOR HARNESS SSM18226.    ON 1/24/05, THE ENGINE AGAIN SHUT OFF AND WAS TOWED TO AUTO WAY FORD.  THEY WERE TOLD BY THE FORD ENGINEERS TO DO A \"WIRE WIGGLE TEST\".  THEY COULD NOT DETERMINE THE PROBLEM BUT KEPT IT FOR 12 DAYS.  THE TECH REFERRED THE PROBLEM TO GEORGE S., THE SERVICE MANAGER.    ON 2/7/05, TRUCK AGAIN DIED AND HAD TO BE OWED TO AUTO WAY FORD.  THE REPLACED THE FICM AND CLEARED THE MODULES.  THEY HAD THE TRUCK 8 DAYS.    BASED ON THE PAST HISTORY, WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE IN TAKING THE TRUCK FOR LONG DISTANCES.  ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ENGINE WILL SHUT OFF WHILE WE'RE ON AN INTERSTATE OR A BUSY ROAD.      WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD IDLE PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE TRUCK, THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL THE TRUCK WAS AROUND A YEAR OLD WITH ONLY 19,115 MILES.  THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OF THIS TRUCK IS OBVIOUSLY QUESTIONABLE.",

ON 6/8, BEFORE A TRIP TO FLORIDA, MY HUSBAND TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR SERVICE AND TO HAVE THE OTHER PROBLEMS CHECKED. THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPT SAID THEY COULD'T FIND THE PROBLEM BUT DID MENTION THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING. WE LEFT FOR VACATION THE VERY EARLY ON 6/18. ON 6/25, IN FL, THE TRANSMISSION BROKE DOWN. COULD ONLY GET IT IN ONE GEAR, THE TOW/HAULING LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON. A DEALERSHIP THERE IN PALM BEACH, DIAGNOSED-WE NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION. METAL SHAVINGS WERE FOUND IN THE TRANSMISSION WHEN IT WAS TAKEN APART. (WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT DISCLOSE TO US THE FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED ONCE, AT 17 MILES. IT HAD 79 MILES ON IT WHEN WE PURCHASED IT). A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS ORDERED AND WE WERE STRANDED ANOTHER WEEK BEFORE IT WOULD ARRIVE. ON 6/30, MY HUSBAND PICKED UP THE TRUCK BUT IT STILL WASN'T OPERATING PROPERLY. ABOUT 8PM HE CALLED TO SAY THE TRANSMISSION HAD BROKEN AGAIN. BACK TO THE FL DEALERSHIP THE NEXT MORNING, LED TO ANOTHER DIAGNOSIS OF THE COMPUTER/PROCESSOR BEING BAD.  THAT WAS REPLACED AND THE TRUCK HAS WORKED SOMEWHAT PROPERLY SINCE THAT TIME.  IT STILL HAS SOME ODD SOUNDS COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION, THE GAS MILEAGE HAS DROPPED AS LOW AS 8.9 (ORIGINALLY -17 MPG - PULLING A CAMPER.) IT STILL IDLES ROUGHLY SO WE EXPECT TO BREAK AGAIN.
