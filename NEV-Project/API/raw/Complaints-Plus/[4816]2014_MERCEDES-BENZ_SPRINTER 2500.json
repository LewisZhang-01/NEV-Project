THAT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED IT LAST AUGUST. I TOOK IT TO TWO MERCEDES DEALERS BUT NO USE. I ALSO EXPERIENCED A DRASTIC DROP IN FUEL MILEAGE IT SUDDENLY DROPPED FROM AROUND 19 TO 13.5 MPG AT THAT TIME I NOTICED GRINDING NOISE ALL THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE DEALER. ON 2/27/2015 AT 2:15 AM A LOUD KNOCK ON THE DOOR WOKE US UP THE PERSON WAS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER THAT HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY TOLD US TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE VAN IN THE DRIVEWAY WAS ON FIRE.

THERE IS NO WAY TO SEE WHAT IS SELECTED BY THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH EXCEPT WITH A FLASHLIGHT. THE INTERIOR LIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE THE DASH IN THE ARE OF THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH TO KNOW WHERE IT'S SET.    THIS IS STRANGE BECAUSE EVERY OTHER SWITCH AND INDICATOR ON THE DASH IS BACK-ILLUMINATED EXCEPT THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH. THE SWITCH IS A ROTARY SWITCH WITH AN OUTER RING THAT SHOWS WHAT IS SELECTED WHEN THE INNER KNOB IS AT THAT POSITION. THE ONLY PART THAT IS ILLUMINATED IS THE LINE ON THE INNER KNOB. THE SELECTION POINTS AROUND THE KNOB ARE NOT ILLUMINATED. EVERY OTHER ITEM ON THE DASH IS ILLUMINATED FROM BEHIND EXCEPT THOSE AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH.    THIS IS A CONCERN BECAUSE AT NIGHT YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH IS SET TO AND IT TAKES YOUR CONCENTRATION OFF THE ROAD AND DRIVING AS YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEADLIGHT SWITCH IS SET.  *TR",
