THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT REPAIR WAS TO FLUSH THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM. THIS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN A WORSE OSCILLATION. THE PROBLEM WAS STILL INTERMITTENT BUT OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY. THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND I ASKED FOR THE STEERING GEAR TO BE REPLACED. THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE NEXT STEP WAS TO REPLACE THE STEERING DAMPER. THIS ALSO DID NOT RESULT IN ELIMINATION OF THE PROBLEM. DURING THE DAMPER REPLACEMENT IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE EXISTED A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF PLAY IN THE DRAGLING BALL JOINT. WHILE NOT PARTICULAR OUT OF THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE WE AGREED TO REPLACE THE DRAG LINK.

MY TRUCK IS THAT SEVERE IT WILL LEAVE THE ROAD IF YOUR NOT EXPECTING IT. THE TIRE PRESSURE IS CORRECT AND NO SUSPENSION MODIFICATIONS. I HAVE HAD THIS FRONT END COMPLETELY REBUILT TWICE EVERY YEAR SO FAR SINCE PURCHASE AND AS OF MARCH OF THIS YEAR IT NEEDS IT AGAIN.

THE STEEP DROPOFF AND NATURE OF THE ROAD DID NOT ALLOW EITHER DRIVER TO COMPLETELY MOVE OVER ENOUGH AND THE MIRRORS OF THE TWO TRUCKS BUMPED. THE MIRROR ON THE OTHER TRUCK, A CHEVROLET, BROKE AWAY CAUSING NO INJURY TO THE DRIVER AND MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.  THE MIRROR ON MY DAUGHTER'S 2006 FORD EXPLODED SENDING SHARDS OF GLASS FLYING THROUGHOUT THE CAB OF THE TRUCK. MY DAUGHTER REQUIRED A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STITCHES, AND FOLLOW UP MEDICAL TREATMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE FLYING GLASS, THE MIRROR HOUSING SEPARATED AND ONE LARGE SECTION STRUCK MY DAUGHTER IN THE SHOULDER BEFORE COMING TO REST IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE EXTENDED CAB TRUCK WHILE A SMALLER SECTION OF THE HOUSING LANDED IN THE TRUCK'S BED.  BOTH VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 30 MPH AND WERE SLOWING WHEN THEY MET. THE CHEVROLET MIRROR DETACHED WITH NO INJURY AND MINIMAL DAMAGE. THE FORD MIRROR CAUSED PHYSICAL INJURY AND OVER A $1000 IN DAMAGES TO THE TRUCK.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE DESIGN OF THE FORD AND CHEVY MIRRORS WHICH CAUSED THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION AND HARMED THE FORD'S DRIVER.  PICTURES, MEDICAL RECORDS, AND A STATEMENT WERE SENT TO FORD BUT THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN AND REFUSE TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON THIS SITUATION. THEY HAVE ALSO REFUSED TO RETURN THE DOCUMENTS AND PICTURES WHICH I HAVE SUBMITTED.  WE OWN  2005 AND 2006 FORD TRUCKS AND ARE NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THEM WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN FOR FEAR OF INJURY FROM POSSIBLE FLYING GLASS IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  *NM",
