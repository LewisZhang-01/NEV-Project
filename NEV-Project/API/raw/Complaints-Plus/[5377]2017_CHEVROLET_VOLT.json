I believe the electric power steering was also disabled in both events. Luckily these events both occurred at low speeds, not on a crowded highway, as I do not believe this failure would allow the driver to get to the shoulder. The car was immobilized after both events and needed to be reset to drive home in a 'reduced propulsion' limp mode. There were not, to my knowledge, any warnings, CELs, etc. before the first event.  The car has been with the local Chevy dealership for over two months waiting on part availability, as this is a common failure. It appears from online discussion that this is extremely common on this year and make.",

The screen showed an error message \"Action required - Shift to park\".  The car was in park already.  I would push the start button.  Shift into gear and shift again into park. In the beginning that solved the problem.  But the car did not fully shut down when the error message is displayed.  If the door is opened, the signal that the engine is running beeps.  I took it to the dealer service department .  They kept the car for a day to diagnose the problem but did not get the error message.  But as the problem was intermittent, it continued.  I returned the car to the dealer and they said they made an adjustment that should resolve the problem.  It didn't.  The problem became constant and I could not shift into park.  The car did not fully shut off and I couldn't lock it.  I returned the car to the dealer and it was there for several days while they waited for a new shifter.  It was on their EV charger full time so as to not drain the battery.  The shifter was replaced in February 2019.  I thought this was a random incident but found out it is not.  In July 2021 the same problem returned.  I called 2 dealers for an appointment and have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment.  I looked online for solutions and to see if others had the same experience.  I found many postings and comments with screenshots of the same error message and cars not turning off.  It seems to be a defect affecting the Volt and other GM cars of the same age.  I had an appointment at lunch 8/3/21 and after several tries to engage the parking gear, the car still would not turn off.  I had to leave it running in the parking lot for 30 minutes and it would not lock.  The car shut off normally when I returned to the office.    This is not an issue of safety on the road, but the inability to turn off the car and lock it is a safety factor, especially for women.",

Immediately my dashboard gave me a warning message saying \u201creduced propulsion acceleration may be limited\u201d and the engine warning light came on. The temperature of my coolant began to rise over 230 F & then 240. Miles from my destination, I reduced speed & took the next exit to stop for fuel and read my owners manual. I discovered that the same message could appear if the car was not put into \u201cmountain mode\u201d thereby failing to reserve a certain amount of energy in the battery. I had hoped we starting the engine & resetting the computer with the car in \u201cMountain mode\u201d would resolve the matter, but that was not the case. I let the engine cool down for a bit & restarted my trip as I was just 20 miles away from my destination. Later on, I got another message as my engine began frequently skipping and sputtering that told me my \u201cengine as not available\u201d despite having a bear full tank of gas. I pulled over to read the manual & discovered that this message indicated once my car ran out of electric energy it would just stop working! As I had been on the road for 6.5 hours prior, I knew there was no electric reserve to pull from & said a prayer that my 4-yr-old daughter and I could get safely and get a tow to the dealership. The \u201creduced propulsion\u201d message is part of a recall on the gen2 Volt, tho that recall relates to a software glitch & the remedy just provides \u201cadditional warning time\u201d for this serious issue. My car just turned 5 years with 33,000 miles on it. I have followed all maintenance recommendations. Seems like an electrical emissions issue, & with a lithium battery on board, fire from overheating scares me as much as than engine failure on the interstate. But I had a full tank of gasoline!

Recently took it to the HVAC specialists at the local dealer who diagnosed it as other than HVAC related smell even though it only happens when air goes through the vents. These same people make safety repairs and are ASE certified. GM customer service says it needs a second \"permanent\" treatment in 3 months (evaporator core foam and sealant) and then it will be better. Dealer failed to fix after 1 full day and 1 half day. Washed car each time and elongated a 3 inch windshield crack into almost the entire windshield top to bottom because they leave cars in the heat all day and then wash before the customer picks them up. The technician admitted it happens all the time (maybe wash when it first arrives or let people know it may cause a crack to get worse. Never charged the car even though that's a Volt process.

There was no other damage other than the connector and it took a few hours to air out the garage.  I had plugged it in to be charged at 12 amps with the dash indicating \"7 miles\" of charge left.  The dash indicated \"9 miles\" of charge available after the fire (full charge this time of year is approximately 58 miles).  The fire went out on its own.  The charger has been plugged in the same outlet for the last 3 years and there is almost no load on that circuit other than the car (exterior lighting that has 4 led bulbs of low lumens).  After the fire my wife recalled that she thought the charger handle felt hot once the previous week when she unplugged it.  This is a serious safety issue because it could have started a house fire and risked the health, lives, and safety  of my family--5 of us and a dog, nevermind the damage to property and risk to first responders.  I reported this to the dealer I bought the 2017 Volt from new, which is Fitzgerald Auto in Frederick, Maryland.  They asked me to bring the charger and car out same day which I did.  It took them 3 days to call me and inform me solely that the charger is not covered under warranty anymore because it has been more than 3 years and 36 thousand miles since I purchased the car, and they told me technically it is \"an accessory\" and not part of the car.  They asked me to purchase another charger from them at more than $600 which I declined to do.  I do not know if they informed Chevrolet/General Motors of the issue or sent the damaged charger in for analysis.  They did not comment at all on the safety part of it.",

TWICE I WAS ABLE TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND RESTART WITH THE GAS MOTOR.  THE OTHER 2 TIMES I WAS NOT ABLE TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND WAS UNABLE TO REGAIN POWER; HAD TO BE TOWED TO NEAREST DEALERSHIP WHERE THE TECHNICIAN SPECIALIST WAS REQUIRED TO DISENGAGE AND RESTART THE VEHICLE WITH THE GAS MOTOR ( AT THIS POINT THERE WAS NO MORE POWER IN THE BATTERY).",

THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP, SINGH, RIVERSIDE, CA THAT RECEIVED THE TOW VEHICLE STATED THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO 3 DEFECTIVE FUSES THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BATTERY SYSTEM OF THE VEHICLE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE FUSES WERE PRODUCED OVERSEAS AND THAT THERE WERE NO PARTS AVAILABLE FOR THE CAR AND NO ESTIMATED DATE WHEN THE PARTS WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT GMC HAD SENT OUT A FLYER RELATING TO THIS PROBLEM AND THAT IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM.  AFTER 3 WEEKS I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND I PICKED IT UP.  THREE DAYS AFTER PICKING UP THE CAR I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE CAR WAS TOWED BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP.  A GMC FIELD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE DEALERSHIP TO RUN DIAGNOSTICS ON THE CAR.  GMC IS IN THE PROCESS OF RE-PURCHASING THE VEHICLE FROM ME UNDER THE CALIFORNIA LEMON LAW.  THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR OF THIS PROBLEM FOR 7 WEEKS.",
