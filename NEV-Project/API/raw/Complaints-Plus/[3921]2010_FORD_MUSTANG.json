        "summary": "IN DECEMBER 2018 MY CAR BEGAN TO MAKE CRUNCHING, SQUEAKING AND CHIRPING SOUNDS COMING FROM THE FRONT SUSPENSION WHEN DRIVING SLOWLY OVER UNEVEN SURFACES, SMALL CRACKS IN ROAD, GOING SLOWLY OVER SPEED BUMPS OR UP DRIVEWAY RAMPS.   THERE IS ALSO A NOTICEABLE SHIMMY IN THE STEERING WHEEL AT OVER 30 MPH.  IN JANUARY, MY FORD SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME I NEED TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLIES FOR APPROX $1,700 WHICH COMES AS A HUGE SHOCK TO ME CONSIDERING MY CAR HAS ONLY 14,000 MILES ON IT!!! I WENT HOME TO DO SOME RESEARCH FOUND A TSB FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARMS WITH A RE-DESIGNED CONTROL ARM WITH UPGRADED BALL POINT SHAFT AND HYDRO-BUSHING. TSB# 09-24-16 LINK: HTTPS://LATEMODEL.CACHEFLY.NET/DOWNLOADS/TSB05-14/TSB09-24-16.PDF  THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON WEBSITES AND BLOGS ACROSS THE INTERNET WRITTEN BY OTHER MUSTANG OWNERS WHO HAVE FACED THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAD TO FIND LESS COSTLY AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS AFTERMARKET SOLUTIONS. APPARENTLY FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT SINCE 12/2009, HAS ENGINEERED UPGRADED REPLACEMENT PARTS AND YET HAS NOT MOVED TO PROACTIVELY REPLACE THESE DANGEROUS SUSPENSION/STEERING PARTS SINCE THEN. APPARENTLY, THEY ARE WAITING UNTIL A CUSTOMER COMES IN WITH A COMPLAINT TO NOTIFY THEM! A DRIVER COULD REASONABLY THINK THIS OFFENDING SOUND IS JUST A NATURAL SQUEAK ON AN AGING CAR AND CHOOSE TO IGNORE IT UNTIL THE THIN ORIGINAL BALL JOINT SHAFT GIVES WAY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT OR EVEN A FATALITY. I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPERVISORS AND THE FORD DEALER WHO BOTH SAY THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT HAVING FORD FIX THIS WITHOUT PUTTING THE FULL COST AND BURDEN ON THE CUSTOMER. THIS IS A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY FOR NHTSA TO COMPEL FORD TO GET THESE DANGEROUS PARTS OFF THE MANY CARS STILL OPERATING WITH THESE ADMITTEDLY SUBSTANDARD PARTS. THANK YOU",

I UNDERSTAND THAT FORD IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS ISSUED AT LEAST ONE TSB ON IT, IF NOT MORE, YET CONTINUES TO KNOWINGLY SELL THESE VEHICLES WITH DEFECTIVE PAINT JOBS ON THEM, CAUSING THEIR CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL LOSS IN HAVING TO REPAINT THE VEHICLE IN AS FEW AS 3 YEARS AFTER PURCHASING.  DUE TO THE CORROSIVE NATURE, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INTRICATE PROCESS TO REPAINT THESE AND REQUIRES SPECIAL PROCESSES AND FORD IS REFUSING TO FIX THESE VEHICLES EVEN THOUGH THEY CREATED THE PROBLEM. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS ONE LAWSUIT IN PROGRESS BUT IT ONLY GOES UP TO 2007 MODELS I THINK, BUT APPARENTLY THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES BEYOND THAT YEAR THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I READ \"FORD USED ALUMINUM HOODS BUT FAILED TO PROPERLY INSULATE THEM FROM PRIOR MODEL YEAR IRON-BASED CONNECTING AND SUPPORTING PARTS, DESPITE KNOWING THAT WOULD GIVE RISE TO GALVANIC COUPLING AND CORROSION\" FOR A MORE TECHNICAL ANSWER. ALSO I FOUND \"WHAT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS THAT FORD ACTUALLY WROTE A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) AND SENT IT OUT TO ALL OF ITS DEALERS IN 2004 OUTLINING THE ISSUES WITH THE HOODS AND HOW TO REPAIR THEM PROPERLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DENY ALL WRONG DOING OR THAT AN ISSUE EVEN EXISTS - BUT IT IS PRETTY HARD TO IGNORE THAT AN ISSUE EXISTS WHEN A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH OF 'MUSTANG HOOD PROBLEMS' OR \"FORD PAINT PROBLEMS\" WILL BRING UP FORUM AFTER FORUM OF MUSTANG OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE\".

IN MARCH OF 2016, I RECEIVED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT MY SUBARU ALSO HAD A TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL FOR THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AIRBAG.  THE WRITTEN NOTICE SAID NO ONE SHOULD USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  CURIOUSLY, NO SUCH WARNING WAS GIVEN FOR MY FORD MUSTANG.  I ASSUME IT IS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE TO BE PARKED UNTIL IT WAS FIXED.  IT IS NOW APRIL 2016, I E-MAILED FORD YESTERDAY AS I HAVE NOT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE TO FIX MY VEHICLE.  FORD RESPONDED THAT THE PARTS ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE 9 MONTHS LATER!!!  HOWEVER, THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG IN MY SUBARU WAS FIXED YESTERDAY.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT PARTS ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE 9 MONTHS LATER.

I ALSO MENTIONED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE FORD DEALER THE CONSUMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 13NO3 WHERE U GUYS MENTION THE FORD ESCAPE BUT ALSO TALK ABOUT COMPLAINTS ON THE MUSTANG AND SEVERAL OTHER FORD VEHICLES,AND HE SAID THAT MY MUSTANG WAS NOT ONE OF THEM.AGAIN I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH ALL THE COMPLAINTS MENTIONED BY DIFFERENT SOURCES ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE IN THE THROTTLE BODY ON THE 2010 MUSTANG.

ALL WIRES, CONNECTORS, AND FUSES WERE DOCUMENTED TO BE IN GOOD STANDING. THE CAR HAD BEEN DRIVING PERFECTLY AND CRANKING WITH NO PROBLEM, THEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED OUT OF THE BLUE. THE SAME DAY IT WENT DEAD, THAT MORNING IS WHEN MY CAR STARTED UP SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT; BUT I DID NOT PAY IT MUCH ATTENTION, SINCE IT DID CRANK. LATER THAT DAY, I STARTED MY CAR AND IT SLIGHTLY TOOK A SECOND LONGER TO CRANK; WHICH IS WHEN I THEN FIGURED SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG. I MADE IT TO MY DESTINATION - WHERE I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT A 1.5 HOURS - GOT IN THE CAR TO LEAVE, AND THAT'S WHEN I FIRST EXPERIENCED A COMPLETELY DEAD BATTERY. I THEN WAS ABLE TO GET A JUMP, WHICH STARTED MY CAR RIGHT BACK UP; WHEREAS, I THEN HEADED TO AUTOZONE AND GOOD YEAR TIRES TO HAVE MY BATTERY TESTED. EACH PLACE STATED THAT MY BATTERY WAS 100% AND CHARGING PERFECTLY. I THEN WENT TO AN AUTO ELECTRIC SHOP AFTER GOOGLING THE PROBLEM, AND SEEING THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME YEAR AND PREVIOUS MUSTANG MODELS. AFTER 5 HOURS OF DIAGNOSING MY CAR AND SEEKING WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE, I WAS INFORMED BY THE CAR TECHNICIAN THAT THE ISSUE OF THE DRAINING IS BEING CAUSED FROM THE MALFUNCTIONING OF THE SMART JUNCTION BOX - LOCATED IN THE FOOT PANEL OF THE PASSENGER SIDE. *TR",
