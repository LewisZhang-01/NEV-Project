        "summary": "The defects that cause coolant to leak into the engine cylinders, causing significant damage and, in some cases, complete engine failure. I have an invoice of over 2100.00 that did not repair the damage. My mechanic spoke to Ford dealership and they said they were aware of the problem and explained the issue to him.  He sent me several estimates and so did Ford stating I need a new engine that would cost and estimated amount of $8200-$12,000.00.  After the engine light came on. everytime I took it to get fixed, \"cylinders\" the engive light would go out temporarily and then I went to pull out of my home and was almost hit because my car would not go.  it just kept stuttering. (best way I can describe it)  my son and i were cussed out by the woman thinking I just purposely stopped in the middle of the road.   There are several class action lawsuits against Ford over this matter since 2020.  I called them and they refused to help me but told me to get another estimate from a Ford Delearship that would cost me an additional 500 plus.  I am a single mom and owe almost 16,000.00 on this and cannot afford to get a new engine.  My heart breaks that I a cannot travel to see my elderly parents and grandparents.  In order to drive around town, I have to put several bottles of coolant in it a week.  while my car was in the shop my son missed the bus and had to walk home 3 mile in the winter months.  I hope that you can help us.",

I could feel a loss of response of the engine while I was driving accompanied by shuddering and an odd noise. This happened within 3 minutes of leaving my house on a cold day, traveling about 1/4 mile. Fortunately, I was on a back road with a low speed limit and could pull over to the shoulder safely. However, had this been on a highway I may have had major safety issues with loss of acceleration and ability to safely move my vehicle to the side of the road. The problem was confirmed by an independent auto shop as well as the dealership by inspection where antifreeze was found to leak into the engine block and cause engine failure. This was noted as a service bulletin by the dealer, but never as a recall nor was it shared with car owners. My vehicle has only ~43000 miles on it. The check engine light to my vehicle turned on a few weeks prior to the engine failure. A diagnostic check by a service provider indicated a cylinder misfire caused by worn out spark plugs or ignition coils and repair was not urgent. This was also 1 week after I had my car inspected by the dealer for a tune up, oil change, and general check where I was told everything looked normal. The check engine light went off for periods of time before coming back on and there was a slightly rougher idle to the vehicle, but no obvious warning signs indicating engine contamination with antifreeze and imminent failure. I was told a compression test of the engine could have helped spot the problem before engine failure, but this was not confirmed by the car dealer.",

The Service rep advised me I need an appointment to have the car checked. I advised him that the check engine light came on and It might be a serious problem and I\u2019m not driving the car. Ford took the car 14 days ago I\u2019m awaiting an answer on the status.  The engine was blown due to oil mixing with coolant through the cylinder. A quick Google check of the 2018 Ford escape has many complaints similar to mine. I called Fords Main office inquired if there was any recalls or any problems and they told me there was no recalls and no problems. This is a serious problem if somebody disregards the check engine light and the motor Ceased they could be a rear end collision. I observed on Car websites that people have complained of the similar problems and Ford does nothing about it. How can these dealers get away with not advising owners of possible serious the physical injury or death caused by defective parts that they are well aware of?  I believe this needs checking into further by governmental agencies and force Ford to repair the engines and extend the warranties on those bad motors they\u2019re aware of. My brother drives a Ford escape at work the car has three engines in it and it only has 48,000 miles. The same problem with my car happened with all three of those of the motors. It\u2019s a shame Ford could get away with us. Ford is repairing the car right now after me insisting to them that I wasn\u2019t leaving with the check engine light on. When the service manager advised me the motor was shot he also told me my free oil changes would not be honored any longer although I have it in writing. These dealers get away with it because they know you\u2019re not gonna go to arbitration over a couple oil changes but they get away with it. The problem with the 1.5 eco-boost Ford motor should immediately be recalled and repaired the warranty.extended  Sincerely yours,  [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

Upon further investigation, we discovered that this is a common and known issue for at least 5 separate models of Ford vehicles since 2015 and requires an entire replacement of the long block engine assembly. Despite that, Ford advised us they would be unable to help us without a dealer diagnostic whenever that became available. So while waiting for this supposed service to determine an already known issue in a month, my family must risk their lives with an engine that has coolant leaking into it if we want to be able to function outside of our home. Ford Motor Company is risking the lives of thousands with these engines, but since there is no recall we are left with no support.The ISCs and our other warranty companies cannot help due to the existing Ford powertrain warranty, but Ford refuses to acknowledge the issue.",

I started experiencing engine coolant fluid leaking into my cylinder side lenders on May 18, 2021. I had the cylinder repaired.  Since that date my car continued to overheat.  I took my car to approximately 4 mechanics and I was told they did not see any leaks.  The four different mechanics could find anything wrong with my car. Due to financial challenges during this pandemic my mother moved in with my two children and myself.  We have experienced some challenges however I continued to pay my car payment on time. My car continued to overheat so I only used it to for necessities.  I did a lot of research on my car attempting to determine what was going on and eventually on July 2, 2021, I found out my 2018 Ford Escape had been recalled and there was a big class action lawsuit that had been filed against Ford Motor Company over its EcoBoost engine taken in cars produced from 2013 to 2019 it alleges engine coolant is leaking into cylinders this is in addition to an Arkansas lawsuit already filed that includes both owners and lessees of both Ford and Lincoln cars and trucks with EcoBoost engines and alleges the defects results in the engine tendency to overheat cell and catch on fire second period.

I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY STARTED A CASE FILE ON IT. FORD SAID THAT I NEED TO PICK UP MY ESCAPE WHEN IT IS READY AND DRIVE IT FOR AT LEAST 5 DAYS, AGAIN I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE.
