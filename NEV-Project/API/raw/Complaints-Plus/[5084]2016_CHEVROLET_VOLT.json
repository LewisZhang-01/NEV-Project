In the afternoon after it was charged I had the same fob and got in to move it back by our front door and the screen gave the message \"No remote detected\". I assumed the fob battery was dead and changed it and it still would not recognize the fob. Then I got my wife's fob and it would not recognize that one either. So the keyless remote system in the car had failed in some way. I went online and saw there were plenty of cases of this happening to this model and other Chevy models that used a similar system. There is some issue with this system and it is very dangerous as someone could easily get stranded if they were alone in some remote place and not understanding how to even get in their car as there is no visible keyhole on the door to put the mechanical key.  To follow up just as I was going out to the car to read the mileage all of a sudden the fob worked again. Both now work. It has been about 20 hours where it wouldn't work. I tried it many many times over those 20 hours and neither fob would work but now they both do. So this as many have reported , is an intermittent problem but dangerous because at any time you could be locked out of your car and you have to know how to pry off part of the door handle and insert the mechanical key and then place the fob in the special place under the lid in the console to be able to drive. Certainly once it happens to you and you learn all that you can do it in a reasonable time frame but when it happens the first time you are really stuck.",
