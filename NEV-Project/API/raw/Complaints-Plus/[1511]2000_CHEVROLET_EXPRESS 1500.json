THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE SEAT WILL UNEXPECTEDLY MOVE CAUSING THE OPERATOR TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. IN AN EFFORT TO RECTIFY THE SEAT PROBLEM I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE MAKER OF THE SEAT. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT AS PHONE MESSAGES AND E-MAILS WERE NOT RETURNED. THE SEAT DECAL AT THE BASE STATES THE SEAT WAS MANUFACTURED BY ATWOOD MOBILE PRODUCTS. AFTER FINALLY RECEIVING AN ANSWER FROM THEM, THEY STATED THE SEAT BASE IS AT FAULT AND WAS MANUFACTURED BY LLEBROC INDUSTRIES (817-831-6261). THE PICTURES I TOOK WERE SENT TO LLEBROC AND THEY ADVISED THE COMPLETE SEAT BASE MUST BE REPLACED. I PURCHASED THE SEAT BASE AT COST OF $245.00. THE BASE SENT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME AS THE BASE THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE. THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE SEAT TO THE BASE ARE THIN PIECES OF METAL THAT ARE PRONE TO FAILURE AGAIN.
