UPON MY INSPECTION OF THE COMPONENTS IT IS EVIDENT THAT EXCESSIVELY HIGH HEAT OCCURRED  AS SHOWN BY THE DISCOLORATION OF THE PRESSURE PLATE ASSEMBLY... THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT FAILURE OCCURS WHEN THE HEAT CAUSES DISTORTION OF THE PRESSURE PLATE RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF APPLIED PRESSURE FROM THE PRESSURE PLATE DIRECTED TO THE DRIVEN PLATE AND THE FLY WHEEL WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF POWER TRANSMISSION TO THE DRIVE AXLES....  HOWEVER AFTER DRIVING MANUAL TRANSMISSION VEHICLES FOR 38 YEARS I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A CLUTCH ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE AN AMOUNT OF SO CALLED NORMAL SLIPPAGE SO HIGH THAT WOULD CREATE TEMPERTURES SO EXTREME AS TO TURM THE METAL IN THE PRESSURE PLATE BLUE... THE CLUTCH FAILURE OCCURRED ON P.A. I-80 TOLL ROAD IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE ON A MOUNTAIN DOWNGRADE AT ASPEED OF 55 MPH...  THESE TEMPUTURES COULD HAVE CAUSED A FIRE AND THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY FAILURE PLACED THE MOTORING PUBLIC, MYSELF, MY PASSENAGERS, THE VEHICLE AND THE CARGO I WAS HAULING IN DANGER.. IN MY OPINION THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLIES HAVE A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE INVESTIAGATED ASAP... THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.*AK",
