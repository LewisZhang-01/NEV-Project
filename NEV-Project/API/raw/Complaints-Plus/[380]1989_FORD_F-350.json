I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT UNTIL I GOT INTO MY TRUCK AND TURNED THE KEY TO THE ON POSITION. ALL OF A SUDDEN I NOTICED THAT MY REAR GAS TANK WAS EMPTY. I FLIPPED THE SWITCH TO THE FRONT TANK AND IT WAS OVER FULL. AFTER QUITE A PERIOD OF RESEARCHING ONLINE WHEN I HAD TIME TO, I FOUND OUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON THE DUAL FUEL TANK SELECTOR VALVE. THE 91S39 RECALL LIST 1989 F350 ON IT BUT MY TRUCK DOESN'T APPARENTLY FALL UNDER THE RECALL CAUSE THE BUILD DATE IS 11/88 (NOVEMBER 1988) AND VIN AS A 1989. BUT MY RESEARCH ONLINE GAVE ME THE PART NUMBER THAT WAS RECALLED. PART# E7TA-9B263-AB. WHICH MY VALVE HAS THAT EXACT NUMBER ON IT. I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND EVERYTHING IS ORIGINAL ON IT. YES THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MILEAGE. UNFORTUNATELY NO MAINTENANCE EXCEPT FOR OIL CHANGES AND TUNE UP WERE DONE. UNFORTUNATELY HE ALSO NEVER DID ANY RECALLS. MY TRUCK GOES INTO BELL FORD (602-866-1776) HERE IN PHOENIX, AZ  FOR A BRAKE RECALL AND IGNITION SWITCH RECALL. THEY SAID THE DUAL FUEL TANK SELECTOR VALVE WAS NOT A RECALL FOR MY TRUCK. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AND ALL YEARS WITH THIS PART NUMBER SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. THIS VALVE COST ALMOST $200. IF FORD IS NOT GOING TO FIX ALL THERE TRUCKS WITH THIS VALVE ISSUE THEY SHOULD AT LEAST SEND OUT A HALF OFF COUPON SO THOSE OF US THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF CAN PURCHASE THE NEW UPDATED VALVE AND HAVE IT REPLACED. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN NOT POST THE PICTURE I HAVE OF MY VALVE WITH PART NUMBER IN THIS SECTION. BESIDES MY PERSONAL EMAIL LISTED I CAN BE EMAILED AT MY PLACE OF WORK AT THE CITY OF PHOENIX AT : [XXX].
