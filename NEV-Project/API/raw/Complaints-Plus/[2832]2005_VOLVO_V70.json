IT WILL SEEK IDLE, RUN UP TO ABOUT 1,000 RPM &  EITHER DROP TO BELOW 500 RPM OR STALL OUT.  IT DOES THIS ON SEVERAL MAKES OF PREMIUM GAS, MOBIL, SHELL, TEXICO/AMACO, AND OR MARATHON.  IT WILL  RESTART EASILY AND THEN DOES NOT LOSE IDLE AGAIN FOR SOME TIME. I HAD IT CHECKED BY DEALERSHIP, AND THEY FIND THE MASS AIR SENSOR AND THROTTLE MODULE ARE BAD. COST TO CURE IS $1,500.  I DO NOT THINK A CAR WITH 64K MILES SHOULD NEED THIS TYPE OF EXPENSE.  I THINK A CAR THAT STALLS IN TRAFFIC WITHOUT ANY WARNING IS A HAZARD.  I HAVE CONTACTED VOLVO, AND THEY ARE SORRY BUT CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME.  THEY ARE REPLACING OR MAKING ADJUSTMENT TO COST IN SWEDEN AT THIS TIME PER \"BRICKBOARD\" THE VOLVO WEB SITE ON THROTTLE MODULES.  I HAVE ASKED FOR ORIGINAL PARTS, AND WILL SAVE THEM.  *NM",
