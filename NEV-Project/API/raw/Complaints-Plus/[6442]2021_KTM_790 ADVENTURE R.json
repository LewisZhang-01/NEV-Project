It takes 2 or 3 times to start and keeps stalling  I stalls runs rough and even runs on one cylinder for 30 to 60 seconds. Its a 2 cylinder motorcycle.  Once running it runs great rest of day.  MANY folks are seeing  the same condition and KTM is not responding with anything of a solution  I have owned many many motorcycles and even 6 KTMS but their lack of attention here is not good.  Dealers say it's normal or no problem found. My local dealer said yeah, we have seen it no real fix.  The earlier 2019/2020 790 models had hard start issues but this new 2021 890 model is worse, more widespread and more severe\u2014 running on one cylinder at start up.  I am a master mechanic in the auto industry and understand something is wrong. If ANYONE bought a new car and it took several times to start each morning and it ran rough for a little you would not accept it.  Not only is it not great for customer satisfaction but could be hurting the engine and might be an excess EPA emission issue too.

When the engine eventually does start it runs very rough on only one (of two) cylinder. During this rough starting there is an overpowering smell of raw/un-ignighted fuel coming from the exhaust pipe.  There seems to be some kind of issue with the fueling or ignition timing that prevents the engine from running properly on 91+ octane fuel. Switching to a slightly lower 89 (mid-grade) octane fuel mostly, but not completely, seems to fix the issue. However this fuel is not rocommended by the manufacturer due to the high compression ratio and I'm worried that it might cause damage in the long term.  The bike was taken to the KTM dealer who performed a reset of the factory ECU; however, this did not help the issue at all.   Reading online, I've found dozens of people with other 2021 KTM 890 Adventure motorcycles experiencing the same issues e.g. no start, hard starting, running on one cylinder, etc.   Running on only one cylinder and sometimes dying is a major safety issue.",
