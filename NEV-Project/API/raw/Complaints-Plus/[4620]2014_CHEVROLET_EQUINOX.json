I found the larger arm that connects the wiper motor to the wipers had fallen off - both ends. I tried snapping it back in, but the plastic ball joints were really loose.  I checked for active recalls, and there wasn't one for our VIN, but there were for similar models, so I replaced the wiper transmission myself for $121.99 plus tax. The car has 64,000 miles.  Now, 2 weeks later, there is a recall.  The letter says \"corrosion\". There is no corrosion. The plastic socket just wore out (prematurely). Maybe bad type of plastic or the lube was too abrasive.",

Long story short, I was lucky and did NOT KILL OR INJURE anyone. I pull over and can hear wiper motor is running so I turn off and reposition wipers on windshield (my driver side wiper was extended beyond windshield and passenger was half across driver side). Turn on wipers and NOTHING...NO WIPERS but continue  to hear wiper motor. I begin searching online and see this is a KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE and I had NOT been notified. I contacted the dealership Monday morning as soon as they open. 4 Dealerships cannot service KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE for 7 calendar days and im told not a recall on my VIN. I contact GM and was informed this is a KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE. Chevy Equinox Owners SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY MAIL DECEMBER 2019!!!! I asked why I had NOT been notified and GM REP states its the DMV responsibility and I needed to update my info w DMV. I informed rep same address since 2006 and received all registrations via mail at the address since I purchased vehicle. I am MORTIFIED I and all others are NOT being notified.  I was lucky and everyone safe. However, what if we were not so lucky?  Please any/all search : N192266180 Front Wiper Transmission Arm Linkage Failure. This is PDF that I received via live chat w GM. Please read in its entirety. Problem must be confirmed by Diagnostic testing or else will NOT be covered. Just left dealership with repairs made free of charge.  However, thats another hassle as they attempted to blow me off. Per attorney, I had taken my vehicle to 2 private owned mechanics and had diagnostic reports in hand.

Fortunately my spouse was able to get it of the road safely and remained stranded for about an hour until the rain subsided. She was traveling with her 75 year old mother ( Owner of the vehicle mentioned) whom isn't in the greatest of health and two small children.   Had she been traveling on the interstate even at a reduced speed to match the condition, all could have been catastrophic and we would be talking at this point through my lawyer.    After researching  several forums, this seems to be a systemic issue and yet there still is not a recall to hold the auto manufacture accountable for this problem.   Although they have recognized it in the 2013 models. How many people have to die before action is taken?",

ABOUT THREE MINUTES INTO THE RAIN STORM THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS ABRUPTLY STOPPED WORKING AND STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  I HAD ZERO VISIBILITY AND CAME VERY CLOSE TO CRASHING INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND WAIT FOR THE RAIN TO PASS. IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS TO GET HOME BECAUSE I HAD TO CONSTANTLY FIND PLACES TO PULL OVER AND WAIT FOR THE RAIN TO SUBSIDE.  USUALLY IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT 25 MINUTES TO DRIVE HOME FROM THIS DESTINATION.  IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND WE CAME CLOSE TO SERIOUSLY BEING HURT OR KILLED DIRECTLY BECAUSE OF THE WIPER FAILURE AND THE ZERO VISIBILITY DUE TO THE HEAVY RAIN.  I DID SOME INVESTIGATION AND FOUND WHERE GM HAD TO RECALL THE 2013 EQUINOX AND GMC TERRAIN MODELS DUE TO WINDSHIELD-WIPER FAILURE.  I TOOK OUR EQUINOX TO OUR LOCAL CERTIFIED GM DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND REPAIR OF THE WIPER ON JUNE 11, 2019.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SHOWED ME THAT THE WIPER TRANSMISSION ARM HAD BROKEN OFF OF THE WIPER MOTOR.  THIS IS THE EXACT SAME CAUSE OF FAILURE THAT LED TO THE RECALL OF THE 2013 EQUINOX MODEL.  OUR GM DEALER TOLD US THAT NO OFFICIAL RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR OUR 2014 EQUINOX.  GM NEEDS TO RECALL THE 2014 EQUINOX MODEL FOR THE SAME WIPER FAILURE OF THE 2013 EQUINOX MODEL!!! THE 2014 EQUINOX MODELS WERE RELEASED IN THE YEAR OF 2013.  THEY HAVE THE SAME WIPER MODEL ON THEM AS THE 2013 MODELS.  I HAVE THE OFFICIAL REPAIR INVOICE WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WIPER FAILURE DIAGNOSED BY OUR GM SERVICE DEALER.  I ALSO HAVE IN MY POSSESSION THE FAILED WIPER MOTOR ASSEMBLY THAT WAS REMOVED FROM MY EQUINOX.  MY FAMILY AND I BEG YOU TO PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE FAULTY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE 2014 EQUINOX AND REQUIRE GM TO RECALL THIS MODEL.",

I TRIED TURNING THEM OFF AND ON AND HAD TO STOP AT A GAS STATION BECAUSE IT WAS POURING RAIN AT THE TIME.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTED THE WIPERS WITH NO LUCK. I HAD TO CONTINUE TO MY DESTINATION IN POURING RAIN WITH NO WIPERS.  I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO MAKE IT WITHOUT A CRASH TAKING PLACE.  I HAD TO TAKE THE VEHICLE IN FOR REPAIR OF THE WIPERS AT CHAMPION CHEVROLET IN THE AMOUNT OF $385.45.  NOW I HAVE LEARNED THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF A RECALL.   CAN YOU HELP ME WITH REIMBURSEMENT?   THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER MYSELF AND COULDN'T THINK THAT AN ENGINE WOULD HAVE A DEFECT WHICH AFFECTS ALL OF THESE CHEVY VEHICLES SO I PURCHASED IT.    TODAY I CONTACTED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY RECEIVE TOO MANY SAME COMPLAINTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO RECALL RELATED TO 2014 YEAR MODELS AND SINCE IT WENT TO SALVAGE CONDITION THAT IT IS NOW OUT WARRANTY.MY CAR HAD A FRONT BUMPER ACCIDENT, AND NO RADIATOR OR ENGINE ISSUE AFTER THE ACCIDENT. SO IT IS DEFINITELY RELATED TO A DEFECTED ENGINE. ALTHOUGH THE POWERTRAIN IS PROTECTED UP TO 100K MILES, DUE TO THE TITLE STATUS THE OWNER HAS TO PAY FOR ALL THE EXPENSES. I WAS TOLD THAT, IF IT HAD A RECALL, REGARDLESS OF TITLE STATUS THEY WOULD REPAIR IT. THEY USED A VERY BAD DEFECTED ENGINE IN THEIR VEHICLES AND DID NOT ISSUE A RECALL. THERE ARE TOO MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS POSTED ON WEBSITES BY UPSET OWNERS, BUT THEY STILL DO NOT ISSUE A RECALL IN ORDER NOT TO COVER THIS PROBLEM. I AM VERY REGRET THAT I PURCHASED A GM VEHICLE. I WILL NEVER AGAIN.    CAN NHTSA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THESE ENGINES ARE REALLY DANGEROUS ON THE ROADS.

TURNING SLOWLY ON A VERY BUMPY SITE, THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE CAR REFUSED TO FOLLOW THE TRACK OF THE MOHO AND BEGAN A VIOLENT SHAKING MOTION. I HAD TO STOP IN A TRAFFIC LANE ON THE INTERSTATE THEN PROCEED FORWARD AGAIN SLOWLY IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE WOBBLE.  IT APPEARS THE ISSUE IS INSUFFICIENT CASTER ON THE FRONT END WHILE BEING TOWED. IT ALSO APPEARS TO ONLY OCCUR WITH THE 4CYL MODEL WITH ELECTRIC STEERING. THE 6CYL MODEL HAS HYDRAULIC STEERING. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECREATE THE WOBBLE IN A SAFE LOCATION. IF IT OCCURS ON THE HIGHWAY IT'S VERY DANGEROUS AS THE VEHICLE COULD SEPARATE FROM THE TOWING VEHICLE. TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT REMOVING THE FUSE RECOMMENDED IN MY MANUAL WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ELECTRIC STEERING TO BE ENERGIZED. I'M NOT SURE OF ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THIS PRACTICE. THE OTHER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO BUNGEE CORD THE STEERING WHEEL TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON THE FRONT END. AGAIN, NOT SURE OF CONSEQUENCES. I'M LOOKING FOR A PERMANENT SOLUTION SUCH AS A WIRING HARNESS/JUMPER WHICH WOULD STILL ALLOW THE FUSE TO BE PULLED YET KEEP THE STEERING ENERGIZED. CHRYSLER HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH THE JEEP CHEROKEE. I AM HOPING THE EQUINOX IS SIMILAR IN CONSTRUCTION AND THIS IS A SOLUTION. I'VE BEEN TOWING FOR OVER 40 YEARS WITH 85,000 MILES ON THIS COACH.
