That must mean there are lots of folks with this problem that don't know where to report it. While driving, the indicator flashes a bit faster than it should - the only clue it isn't working. You think other drivers know your intentions and they don't. This is dangerous. Mechanics have to pull the bumper, a bit of work, and want over $300 to change the bulb. Over and over again. This is the 5th time in 3 years.  2nd problem is the \"Stability System\" - well, I'm not driving on ice, have never needed such a thing. This one nearly cause me to crash into a curb or parked car as I was making a left hand turn in our residential neighborhood at what 15 mph? Suddenly the wheel locked, tires locked and sent me screeching dangerously close to that parked car. It does have a warning, \"Service Stability System\" but the dealer will want a lot for that, too. So I've resorted to pushing the Disable button on the console until it says, \"Stability System Off\" then I can drive safely. I have not had this inspected. Everything that gets fixed on this Cadillac seems to break again.",

WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER IT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS A EXISTING CONDITION. SO, THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE I HAVE. NOW, THE SAME ISSUE GOT WORSE (@ 108,000 MILES) AND BECAME A SAFETY ISSUE AND I NOTICED THE SAME PROBLEM WAS IN THE RECALL INFO FROM DEC 2007 ON THE LEMONLAW SITE. JULY 17TH 2014 I TOOK MY SUV IN FOR REPAIR ON ANOTHER ISSUE, THEN ON THE 19TH I CALLED THE DEALER CAUSE I STARTED TO HEAR A WHINNNG NOISE AND A CLUNK SOUND THAT WAS EVEN LOUDER THAN BEFORE. THAT SAME DAY AS I WAS TRANSPORTING A CLIENT COMING OUT OF A PARKING LOT MY CAR SUDDENLY JERKED SO HARD MY CLIENT ALMOST BUMPED HER HEAD ON THE DASHBOARD AND ME ON THE STIRRING WHEEL. AFTER HAVING IT TOWED TO ANOTHER CADILLAC DEALERSHIP NEARBY I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE DIFFERENTIAL PINION/ BUSHINGS ALL THE FLUID HAD LEAKED OUT AND WHEN THE TECH SHOWED ME WHAT HAPPEN ALL BOLTS WERE MISSING THAT SUPPOSE TO HOLD PARTS TOGETHER. SO, I ASKED DOES THAT HAPPEN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND HE TOLD ME NO IT DOESN'T AND HES NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. SO, NOW I AM VERY SUSPICIOUS, CONFUSED AND ANGRY. THE REPAIR IS GOING TO COST $3,000, THEY SAID WITH NO WAY AROUND IT, I DID BUY THE CAR USED BUT I FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND/OR DEALER. THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES THAT I HAD WITH THE SUV THAT WAS TAKEN CAREOF, THEY CALLED IT SPECIAL CODES BUT THEY LEFT THIS ONE OUT. PLEASE HELP, I HAVE ELDERLY CLIENTS/FAMILY/ FRIENDS THAT I CARE FOR ON A DAILY BASIS AND I NEED MY SUV. *TR",

I HAVE ALMOST BEEN HIT SEVERAL TIMES BY OTHER DRIVERS BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. I TOOK MY CADILLAC TO A LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP (DALE EARNHARDT CHEVROLET) IN NEWTON NC. ON MY FIRST VISIT TO THE DEALER THEY FOUND A MULTIPLE MISFIRE (CODE P300) AND A FAULTY OIL PRESSURE SENSOR (CODE P0521 & CODE P0523). I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE MISFIRE WAS CAUSING THE TRACTION CONTROL TO ENGAGE, SO THEY CHANGED ALL THE SPARK PLUGS AND CHANGED THE FAULTY OIL PRESSURE SENSOR. WHEN I PICKED UP THE CADILLAC FROM THEM AND DROVE IT HOME THE TRACTION CONTROL CONTINUED TO ENGAGE SEVERAL TIMES. I RETURNED MY CADILLAC FOR THE SECOND TIME TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY. THEY SCANNED THE VEHICLE COMPUTER FOR CODES AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING THAT THE VEHICLE DOES. I RETURNED HOME WITH MY CADILLAC AND DROVE IT FOR SEVERAL MORE DAYS. THE TRACTION CONTROL CONTINUED TO ENGAGE AND WHEN MY FAMILY WAS ALMOST INVOLVED IN ANOTHER CRASH I TOOK IT BACK TO DALE EARNHARDT CHEVROLET FOR THE THIRD TIME. THEY TEST DROVE IT AGAIN BUT STILL THEY COULDN'T GET THE TRACTION CONTROL TO ENGAGE. THEY CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS THIS TIME. GENERAL MOTORS TOLD THEM TO UPDATE THE PCM AND APPLY DIELECTRIC GREASE TO THE EBCM CONNECTORS AND CLEAN THE TERMINALS AND TEST DRIVE. THE DEALERSHIP COMPLETED THE WORK AND TEST DROVE IT FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CADILLAC THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OK NOW. ON MY HOME THE TRACTION CONTROL ENGAGED AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES. THAT WAS ON 07/21/2014.
