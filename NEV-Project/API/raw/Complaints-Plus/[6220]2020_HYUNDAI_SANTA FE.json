It was an explosion sound accompanied by glass falling into the vehicle, a large hole in the sunroof, and the glass on the edge of the hole appearing in an upward direction as though the force of the explosion came from inside the vehicle. The vehicle was being operated in a normal manner at the time of the incident, there was nothing to indicate any potential issue with the vehicle. The hazards associated with this incident include the potential for loss of vehicle control following the loud and unexpected explosion and the potential for injury from falling glass.

I DID NOT LEAVE ANY LIGHTS ON OR ANY DOORS OPEN. I JUST USED MY CAR THE DAY BEFORE THIS AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. NO LIGHTS ON THE DASH CAME ON TO ALERT ME OF ANYTHING AND MY CAR IS ACTING DEAD. MORE DEAD THAN YOUR REGULAR NEEDING A JUMP START DEAD.

THE OVERALL POWER HAS GONE DOWN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

THE DEALER THEN SAID - JUST DRIVE IT IN THE \"SPORT\" MODE AND IT WILL NOT BE AS BAD. THAT IS LUDICROUS. THE DEFAULT MODE IS \"COMFORT\" AND THAT IS WHERE THE BEST RIDE AND PERFORMANCE, MILEAGE, ETC.

HE CHECKED FOR ANY ERROR CODES OR SOFTWARE UPDATES - NONE ARE PRESENT OR AVAILABLE.  THE MECHANIC VERBALLY CONFIRMED THAT THE \"ENGINE LAG\" IS CLEARLY THERE.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE SERVICE WRITER COMPLETED THE TICKET, HE WROTE THAT THE MECHANIC SAID HE COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE UN-TRUTH.
