ONCE AGAIN I NICKED MY FINGER ON  IT. RECENTLY HAD A REPAIR DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP AND  ASKED THE ADVISER ABOUT THE PROBLEM  HE SAID HE HAD NO RECORD OF A RECALL. I FOUND THE RECALL ONLINE & SHOWED HIM.  HE SAID I SHOULD CALL HYUNDAI,.I SPOKE TO A REP @ HYUNDAI WHO TOLD ME THAT EVEN THOUGH I MAY HAVE A PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED IN 10/2001, WHICH MEANS I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL  I WAS FURIOUS. THIS IS NOT AN IMAGINARY PROBLEM - I HAVE CUT MY FINGERS TWICE.  SHE SAID SHE WOULD HAVE SOMEONE CALL ME BACK TO DISCUS FURTHER & THAT NEVER HAPPENED. THAT WAS ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE RECALL DATE SAYS - MY CAR HAS THE EXACT PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL NOTICE. THE REP ALSO TOLD ME THE RECALL GOES BY THE DATE THE CAR WAS PUT INTO SERVICE, NOT THE DATE MANUFACTURED OF 10/01; SHE SAID THE CAR WAS NOT PUT INTO SERVICE UNTIL 3/03-AFTER THE RECALL DATE.THE RECALL SAYS 1/28/02-3/22/03. ALSO I THE CAR HAD TO BE PUT INTO SERVICE EARLIER THAN 03 BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT ON 10/16/02.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ISN'T COVERED BY THE RECALL/CAMPAIGN - WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. BOTH HANDLES ARE PEELING & UNSAFE! WE ARE KEEPING THIS CAR SO IT IS IMPORTANT. JUST BOUGHT A NEW SONATA.TO REPLACE ANOTHER CAR.  *TR",

HOWEVER, AFTER EXAMINING THE VEHICLE, I WAS TOLD BY THEIR MECHANIC THAT THE FRONT RIGHT FRAME WAS CRACKED AND SEPARATING, AND THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  CONTACTED MYRTLE BEACH HYUNDAI (MBH)TO EXPLAIN PROBLEM, AND TO SCHEDULE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT.    THURSDAY, 11-11-11, MBH CONFIRMED THAT THE FRAME IS CRACKED AND SEPARATING.  TOLD US THAT IT WOULD BE REPLACED AT NO COST TO US BECAUSE OF A RECALL, AND THAT CURRENTLY THE CAR IS NOT DRIVABLE.  HOWEVER, WE WERE TOLD THAT A NEW REPLACEMENT FRAME PART WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE END OF NEXT WEEK.  ALSO, WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY ASSOCIATED PARTS TO REPLACE THE BROKEN FRAME, SUCH AS BOLTS, BUSHINGS, AND ETC. IF THEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    FURTHERMORE, WE WERE TOLD THAT MBH WOULD NOT PROVIDE US WITH A LOANER VEHICLE DURING THIS RECALL REPAIRS, AND WE WOULD HAVE TO RENT A VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.   WE ARE ON EXTENDED VACATION AT MYRTLE BEACH, SC AND ONLY HAVE THIS CAR AS OUR ONLY  MEANS OF  TRANSPORTATION.  RENTED A CAR FROM ENTERPRISE RENT-A-CAR FOR THE WEEK AT $156.99 PLUS TAXES, ETC.

THANKFULLY, SHE HAD ONLY JUST DRIVEN ONTO THE ROAD FROM A DRIVEWAY, SO SHE WASN'T GOING FAST AND THE LANE SHE ENTERED WAS CLEAR.

I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET WHERE YOUR AGENCY IS INVESTIGATED THIS MATTER AND ALSO ON THE INTERNET I LEARNED OF MANY OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD ACCIDENTS DUE ENGINE CRADLE FAILURE.  THE SUSPENSION GIVES WAY AND WHEELS FALL OFF, ETC.   IN MY OPINION HYUNDAI USED INFERIOR METAL IN THEIR ENGINE CRADLE AND INCORRECTLY DESIGNED THE ENGINE CRADLE SYSTEM.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS AND OWNED MANY MAKES AND MODELS OF VEHICLES BUT NEVER HAVE I BEEN FACED WITH SUCH A SITUATION.  I REALIZE MANY PARTS HAVE A LIMITED LIFE SPAN BUT THE ENGINE CRADLE SHOULD HAVE AN EXTENDED LIFE.  MY WIFE HAS A 1999 SUBARU WITH MORE MILES THAN OUR SONATA AND WHICH HAS BEEN DRIVEN ON THE SAME ROAD CONDITIONS WITH LESS CARE THAN WE HAVE GIVEN THE SONATA AND YET HER CAR DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AN OBVIOUS AND COMMON  SAFETY ISSUE.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC. HE DID ADVICE TO PUT A NEW BATTERY IN THE CAR. HE SAID IT WAS TIME FOR A REPLACEMENT. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO HIM FOR SOME TIME. AND FIND HIM VERY REPUTABLE IN THE AREA. HOWEVER, THE TOW MAN ALSO COULD NOT PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION. WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR AT HIS SHOP THE KEY WENT IN. BATTERY WORKS GREAT. SO THE NEXT MORNING  2-16-07 THE IGNITION WOULD NOT GO IN AGAIN.  I CALLED MY DEALER AND HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED THERE. THEY SAID IT DIDN'T DO THAT FOR THEM THAT THE CAR WAS FINE. THEY TRIED THE KEY ALL DAY. THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPAIR THE VEHICLE IF THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AT THE TIME OF TESTING THE SITUATION THERE.  THE CAR IS UNDER A POLICY OF WARRANTY FOR 60,000.00 MILES. HOWEVER, I COULD GIVE THEM $160.00 TO OPEN UP THE IGNITION TO THE TUMBLER. I FEEL THAT IF ITS UNDER WARRANTY THAT THEY SHOULD REPAIR THE PROBLEM. THERE ONLY SUGGESTION WAS TO TOW IT AGAIN IF IT PERSISTS. I SAID WHAT IF I GET STRANDED, AND YES, I HAVE NO  CELL PHONE. THEY SAID JUST CALL THE 800# ANWAYS FOR TOW. SO I WASN'T SATISFIED AT GRAPPONIES IN CONCORD NH. SO I ASKED AUTO FAIR IN MANCHESTER, THEY SAID THE SAME THING. I THINK THAT ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE TOW MAN HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS MYSELF. AND THAT WE HAVE TO SEE IF IT HAPPENS FOR THEM, THAT THEY WILL REPAIR AT NO COST AT THAT TIME. WHEN ITS' UNDER THE WARRANTY. MY FEELING IS THAT BOTH DEALERSHIPS THAT ARE LOCAL DON'T WANT TO EAT THE PART FOR INVENTORY, IF THERE IS NOTHING WRONG W/THE CHIP IN THE TUMBLER. SO I GUESS I HAVE TO JUST CROSS MY FINGERS TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. GRAPPINE DID MAKE ME A NEW KEY FOR THE IGNITION. SO I'M A FRUSTRATED CONSUMER IN MANCHESTER, NH. *JB",

ENGINE,WHEN I GOT OFF AT MY EXIT I TOOK A RIGHT TURN WITH NO PROBLEM BUT WHEN I WENT TO TAKE AN IMMEDIATE LEFT TURN I TOTALLY LOST MY POWER STEERING MAKING IT VERY HARD TO STEER. WHEN I LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD I FOUND THAT THE METAL LINE  HAD RUSTED THROUGH AND BURST. THIS IS ONLY A 4 YEAR OLD CAR.  IT WAS TOWED TO GARVEY HYUNDAI WHERE THEY REPLACED THE LINE.  SO I CHECKED MY WIFE'S CAR WHICH IS IDENTICAL EXCEPT THE COLOR AND FOUND THAT HER LINE IS IN THE SAME RUSTED CONDITION BUT HAD NOT YET BURST SO SHE CALLED LIA HYUNDAI BY OUR HOUSE ,TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED TO MINE AND THAT HERS IS IN THE SAME CORRODED CONDITION AND THEY SAID THEY WILL NOT REPLACE IT UNDER WARRANTY UNTIL IT ALSO BURST EVEN IF IT IS CORRODED. I FEEL THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STEER THE CAR IF IT DOES BURST AND WHEN MINE BURST IT SPRAYED ALL OVER UNDER THE CAR, GETTING ON THE CONVERTER, MUFFLER AND TAILPIPE CREATING A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD. I DO NOT HAVE THE OLD PART BUT THE LINE RUNS ALONG THE FRAME AND WHERE IT ROTTED THEY HAVE A PIECE OF RUBBER HOSE TO PROTECT THE LINE BUT IT ALSO CAUSED IT TO PREMATURELY ROT THE METAL LINE UNDER THE RUBBER HOSE SO THE LINE BURST. DUE TO THE FACT THE CAR IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD AND BOTH ARE IDENTICAL CARS  ROTTING THE SAME WAY, I FEEL THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DEFECT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN AND IF SOMEONE CAN'T STEER THE CAR AFTER IT BLOWS THEY COULD HAVE AN ACCIDENT OR A FIRE COULD START DUE TO IT GETTING ON THE EXHAUST. I WOULD LIKE TO GET A RESPONSE SOON AS MY WIFE IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT HAPPENING TO HER. THANK YOU.  *JB",

AFTER WORK THAT SAME DAY, I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE SALESPERSON WHO SOLD ME THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I SPOKE THE SERVICE MANAGER AND HAD HIM WALK OUT TO INSPECT THE FACIA.  HIS FIRST QUESTION TO ME WAS WHETHER I HAD THE VEHICLE REPAINTED.  I TOLD HIM I HAD NOT!  HE THEN ASKED ME IF I HAVE EVER BROUGHT MY CAR TO A TOUCHLESS CAR WASH, WHICH I HAVE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS HERE IN TOWN.  HE THEN STATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE 7500 PSI CAUSED BY THE HIGH PRESSURE WATER THAT THEY WERE NOT AT FAULT AND THAT IT WAS NOT A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  I ASKED WHY THIS WAS NOT OCCURRING ON THE BODY OF THE CAR OR ON THE REAR FACIA, AND HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW.  DISSATISFIED WITH THIS RESPONSE, I CALLED HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY, CA AT 800-633-5151 THAT EVENING (8/5/05) AND SPOKE WITH A GENTLEMAN.  AFTER TELLING HIM OF THE SITUATION, HE THEN STATED THAT I SHOULD TRY TO GET THE CAR FIXED AT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP!
