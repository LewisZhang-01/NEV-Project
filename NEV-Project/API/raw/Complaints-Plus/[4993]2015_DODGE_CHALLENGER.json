THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO DOWNSHIFT UNEXPECTEDLY WHEN THE RIGHT PADDLE SHIFTER IS HELD DOWN TO CHANGE OVER TO THE AUTOMATIC DRIVE SYSTEM.  THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE I STARTED USING THE PADDLE SHIFTERS AROUND 30,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  THE UNEXPECTED DOWNSHIFTING CONSISTENTLY SLAMS THE VEHICLE TO ALMOST A STOP, ABRUPTLY FORCING ANY OCCUPANTS IN THE VEHICLE INTO THE SEATBELTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OCCASIONS WHERE VEHICLES HAVE ALMOST HIT MY VEHICLE BECAUSE THE CAR SHIFTS DOWN SEVERAL GEARS AT ONCE AND SLOWS SUDDENLY WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS.  THE VEHICLE HAS ALSO SLID IN WET CONDITIONS WHEN IT HAS OCCURRED.  DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE THE PADDLE SHIFTERS AT HIGH SPEED IN FEAR OF MY OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS.  IF THE VEHICLE WAS TO DOWNSHIFT SEVERAL GEARS AT SPEED IN WET CONDITIONS, THE VEHICLE WOULD LIKELY SLIDE OUT OF CONTROL.  ADDITIONALLY, THE HARD SHIFTING IS LIKELY CAUSING PREMATURE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE TRANSMISSION, DRIVE COMPONENTS AND TIRES.  THE VEHICLE HAS NOW BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR THIS ISSUE 8 TIMES WITH NO PERMANENT FIX.  THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES AND FORUM REPORTS ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WITH DODGE CHALLENGER VEHICLES, BUT DODGE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FORUMS AND CLAIMS THEY ONLY ADDRESS ISSUES SEPARATELY WITH EACH CUSTOMER.  THIS ISSUE HAS LEFT ME WITHOUT MY VEHICLE FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AND IS A CONSTANT SAFETY HAZARD IF THE PADDLE SHIFTERS ARE OPERATED.  THIS ISSUE IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD TO THE OCCUPANTS AND OTHER DRIVERS SINCE DOWNSHIFTING 2-3 GEARS AT ONCE CAN BE THE SAME AS SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, ESPECIALLY IN WET CONDITIONS.

ONCOMING TRAFFIC WAS 55 MPH. AFTER THE VEHICLE STOPPED (BARELY)..THEN THE SAME FAULTS APPEARED.

FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A HIGH FAILURE RATE ITEM (LAST ONE WAS ON THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL), AND IF IT HAPPENS WHILE BRAKING...I ESSENTIALLY LOSE BRAKING AT THE PRECISE MOMENT BRAKES ARE NEEDED.
