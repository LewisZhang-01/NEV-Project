WHEN MY CAR SHUT DOWN. I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED TRYING TO MOVE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.   I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE POHANIKA HYUNDA DEALERSHIP IN CAPITOL HEIGHTS, MD. THE SAME PLACE I HAD MY FUEL PUMP REPLACED LAST YEAR.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM AND IT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER CAR. I SUSPECT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP.  AFTER I COMPLAIN, THE DEALERSHIP STATES THEY WILL REPLACE THE PART AND NOT CHARGE ME, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $375.00 FOR THE LABOR.  I COMPLAIN TO MANAGEMENT AND THEY SAY THEY WOULD PAY FOR HALF THE LABOR.  THE REASON I'M WRITING THIS LETTER, BECAUSE IF THERE IS A DEFECTIVE PART, I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO BE HURT OR KILL BEHIND THE WHEEL, BECAUSE OF A DEFECTIVE PART.  I HAD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH YOUR AGENCY LAST YEAR  WITH NO RESPONSE.  I ALSO CONTACT HYUNDAI COSTUMER SERVICE AND THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.",

THE HANDLES HAVE FALLEN OFF THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE AND BOTH REAR DOORS.  THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR IS ALMOST NEVER USED, SO I'M DISINCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE THE PROBLEM TO WEAR AND TEAR.  WHEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE CAME OFF, THE PLASTIC SNAPPED APART.  WE PAID TO HAVE THAT HANDLE REPLACED BY THE DEALER.  THE REAR DRIVER DOOR HANDLE, WHICH CAME OFF TWO WEEKS AGO, REMAINED INTACT, BUT A TRIANGULAR METAL PIECE CAME OUT WHEN THE HANDLE FELL AWAY.  THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR HANDLE CAME OFF TODAY WHEN MY HUSBAND HAD THE CAR, SO I HAVEN'T SEEN ITS CONDITION.  SINCE HIS KEY FOB NO LONGER WORKS, HE NOW HAS TO GET INTO THE CAR IS BY CLIMBING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE.  GIVEN THAT WE'VE LOST THREE HANDLES IN SO SHORT A TIME, IT APPEARS THE PARTS ARE INFERIOR AND HAVE REACHED THE END OF THEIR LIFE.",

AS SO MANY OTHERS HAVE REPORTED HERE, IT SIMPLY FELL OFF IN HER HAND WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR. SHE WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THERE WAS NO FIX AVL. FROM THE MFR STANDPOINT--AND DUE TO THE PROHIBITIVE COST OF NEARLY $200 TO FIX IT, LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME, SHE'S GONE WITHOUT THIS REPAIR.      THE DRIVER'S DOOR OUTSIDE HANDLE LIKEWISE FELL OFF A SHORT TIME LATER, WHICH CAUSED MUCH MORE NUISANCE SINCE SHE WAS REQUIRED TO GET IN THE CAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AND CRAWL ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE. FINDING THAT DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST, SHE PAID $182.63 TO GET THAT HANDLE REPLACED AT THE DEALER.      ASIDE FROM BEING A MAJOR NUISANCE, THIS COULD PRESENT A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IN AN ACCIDENT OR SIMILAR SITUATION, IT COULD CAUSE A DELAY OF SEVERAL MINUTES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO REACH SOMEONE INSIDE. IN MANY DECADES, WEVE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER CAR DOOR HANDLES BREAK-BUT WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE HANDLES, IT SEEMS HYUNDAI MUST BE USING INFERIOR PRODUCTS FOR THESE PARTICULAR PARTS.      COULD NHTSA CONSIDER FORCING HYUNDAI TO REPLACE THESE HANDLES AS PART OF A RECALLAND PERHAPS EVEN PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR REPAIRS ALREADY MADE? NHTSA JUST REPORTED AN \"ENGINE RECALL\" THIS MORNING FOR THIS SAME HYUNDAI MODEL, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER MODEL YEARS, WHICH WILL APPARENTLY RESULT IN ENGINES NEEDING TO BE REPLACEDPERHAPS THEY COULD DO A JOINT RECALL TO FIX BOTH ISSUES.

I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY SEE WHEN MY HIGHS ARE ON.

THE CAR ACROSS THE INTERSECTION BEGAN TO MOVE AND I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR AND THE CAR SHOT ACROSS THE INTERSECTION AT FULL SPEED INSTANTLY AND I WAS DRIVEN INTO THE CAR IN FRONT.  THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO STOP THE CAR.  THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG DEPLOYED AND CUT BOTH MY WRISTS WHEN THEY HELD THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RACE UNTIL I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.    A POLICE OFFICER ARRIVED SHORTLY ASKED ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED I REMAIN IN THE CAR.  MEDICS FROM A PRIVATE AMBULANCE SERVICE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE EVENING TRAFFIC IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AND I  OPENED MY FRONT DOOR WINDOWS AND SPOKE TO THEM (A MAN AND WOMAN EMT).  THEY APPLIED BANDAGE PADS TO AIRBAG CUTS ON BOTH WRISTS THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS.  I REMAINED IN THE CAR AND INDICATED I DID NOT NEED HOSPITALIZATION.
