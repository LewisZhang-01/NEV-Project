THIS EVENT WAS WITHOUT ANY WARNING AND THE CAR MADE THE WORST GRINDING NOISES IN THE WORLD.

I BELIEVE IT IS PART OF THE RECALL AND THEY SHOULD BE COVERING THIS AT NO COST. I HAD MY CHILD IN THE CAR AND I THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

DRIVING ABOUT 30 MPH AND THE SAME EXACT NOISE HAPPENED AND INSTANTLY THE TRUCK STOPPED, I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS 11:30 PM, I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THERE WERE NO TOW COMPANIES OPEN. FINALLY SOMEONE CAME TO ASSIST ME AND PUSHED MY 7000LB TRUCK INTO AN EMPTY LOT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. WHEN THE HELP ARRIVED THEY PARKED ABOUT 3 FEET BEHIND MY TRUCK, NOT KNOWING THE TRUCK WAS NOT SAFE IN PARK MY TRUCK DRIFTED BACK AND HIT HIS NEW BMW TRUCK.

I DROVE DOWN A FAIRLY BUSY HIGHWAY WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE MILE FROM MY HOME. AS I PROCEEDED DOWN THE HIGHWAY, I ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE AND THE VEHICLE MADE A LOUD GRINDING NOISE AND BECAME IMMOBILE. LUCKILY, TRAFFIC WAS NOT EXTREMELY HEAVY AND OTHER DRIVERS ALLOWED ME TO DRIFT INTO THE MEDIAN. ONCE IN THE MEDIAN, I PLACED THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND ATTEMPTED TO PLACE IT IN GEAR SO THAT I COULD DRIVE AGAIN BUT IT CONTINUED TO MAKE THIS GRINDING NOISE AND WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL. THE POLICE SHOWED UP AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK SO THAT I COULD GET OFF OF THE BUSY HIGHWAY. I CALLED THE CAR DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT I HAD JUST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL EUROPEAN MECHANIC SHOP AND THE MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THE TRANSFER CASE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. I WAS SHOCKED AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED, SINCE THE VEHICLE APPEARED TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND THE DEALER  IS A REPUTABLE BUSINESS. THE QUOTE FOR THIS WORK IS $5000 AND I WAS ASKED BY THE DEALER IF I COULD COME UP WITH A PORTION COST FOR THE REPAIRS. SINCE THE INCIDENT, I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS VEHICLE AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON INCIDENT AMONG OTHER RANGE ROVER OWNERS OF MODELS 2002 THROUGH 2006. IN MY FINDINGS, THIS APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW AND MECHANICAL ISSUE, NOT TO MENTION A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.
