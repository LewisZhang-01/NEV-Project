        "summary": "THIS CAMPING TRAILER HAS TWO AXLES, WITH A LEAF SPRING SUPPORTING EACH AXLE, ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  WHILE TOWING THIS VEHICLE, AND AFTER APPROXIMATELY 250 MILES OF TRAVEL, PART OF THE PASSENGER SIDE SUSPENSION BECAME DETACHED FROM ITS ATTACHMENT POINTS ON THE FRAME. THE UNATTACHED ENDS OF THE LEAF SPRINGS THEN CAME TO REST UNDER THE FRAME OF THE VEHICLE. THIS NOT ONLY CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO LIST TO ONE SIDE, BUT ALSO CAUSED A UNSAFE CONDITION.  UPON INSPECTION BY A REPAIR FACILITY, IT WAS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE 6 SECURING BOLTS HAD FALLEN OUT. 5 OF THE 6 NUTS HAD FALLEN OFF, AND THE REMAINING NUT WAS LOOSE.  THE DRIVERS SIDE SUSPENSION BOLTS WERE CHECKED, AND FOUND TO BE SECURE. THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE SUSPENSION BOLTS HAD NOT BEEN SECURED, AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE, LEADING TO THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  PICTURES TAKEN AT THE REPAIR FACILITY, ATTACHED.  THE MANUFACTURER COVERED THE COST OF THE REPAIR.",
