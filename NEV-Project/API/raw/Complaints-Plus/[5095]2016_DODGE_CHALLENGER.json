IT HAS HAPPENED ON ALL TYPES OF ROAD--RESIDENTIAL, CITY AND HIGHWAY. IT HAS OCCURRED WHILE BEING DRIVEN STRAIGHT AND WHEN TURNING, ON LEVEL ROADS AND UP HILLS.

THEY STATED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX THE CAR AND HAD TO RELY ON CHRYSLER. THE NEW VIDEO WAS FORWARDED TO CHRYSLER AND A MASTER MECHANIC WAS TO REVIEW IT BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  FURTHER, THEY RECOMMENDED THAT THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN AS IT IS TOO DANGEROUS. SINCE THEN,  THE CAR HAS BEEN PARKED.   *TR",
