OWNER HAD TO REPLACE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD SEVERAL TIMES, THE IGNITION,STARTER, KEY SYSTEM, IDLE CONTROL VALVE, AND OTHER PARTS NUMEROUS TIMES DUE TO THE CAR ENGINE SMOKING, \"TURNING OFF\" OR NOT STARTING AFTER STOPPING, PARKING, AND NOT STARTING UPON INSERTING THE KEY, IDLING HIGH OR TIMING OFF.

MULTIPLE TIMES THE SECURITY LIGHT WOULD BLINK AND OWNER WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 15 MINUTES TO TURN IT ON. GM EVEN HAS THIS LISTED IN THE MANUAL (IN SECURITY FEATURE/LOCK SYSTEM). OWNER FIRST TOLD IT WAS DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE, THEN KEY, THEN IT WAS A SECURITY PROGRAMMING ISSUE, THEN IT WAS THE INTAKE MANIFOLD (NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY FOR SOME REASON).

AFTER A FEW MOMENTS IT WOULD DISAPPEAR. IT BEGAN STAYING ON LONGER AND LONGER SO I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER. THEY CHECKED IT OUT, COULDN??T FIND ANYTHING SPECIFIC, AND TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE THEM PUT IN A NEW COMPUTER. THIS COST APPROXIMATELY $550.00 AFTER THE REPAIR A NEW SYMPTOM BEGAN TO APPEAR: SPONTANEOUS ENGINE STALLING COUPLED WITH LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL. ATTEMPTS TO RESTART THE CAR RESULTED IN NO ENGINE CRANKING. I FOUND THAT AFTER WAITING FOR A WHILE THE CAR WOULD START AGAIN AND BE FINE. AT ONE POINT WE WERE TRAVELING AT FREEWAYS SPEEDS ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE. MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING AND MY TWO YOUNG GRANDDAUGHTERS WERE IN THE BACK SEAT. SUDDENLY THE ENGINE STALLED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IT WAS FRIGHTENING, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SAFELY. WE SAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS ON THE SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF WE WERE GOING TO BE STRANDED. AFTER A FEW TRIES, THE CAR STARTED UP OKAY AND WE CONTINUED TO OUR DESTINATION. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL PARKING LOT, IT REPEATED THIS BEHAVIOR. WE COMPLETED OUR JOURNEY AND GOT HOME SAFELY. A FEW DAYS LATER I TRIED TO START THE CAR BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD. I CONTACTED THE SAME CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WHO SENT A TOW TRUCK TO FETCH US AND THE VEHICLE. ONCE AT THE DEALERSHIP, ONE OF THE MECHANICS QUICKLY SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE THE IGNITION SWITCH. THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH AND CHARGED ME OVER $400. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND THE REPAIR BILLS WERE A LOT FOR ME TO HANDLE.   *TR",

THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING IS IDENTICAL TO THE RECALL NOTICE. THE 5 DIGIT GM RECALL NUMBER IS 03043 AND THE SUMMARY IS:    SUMMARY:  CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES HAVE HAZARD WARNING SWITCHES THAT MAY EXPERIENCE SOLDER JOINT CRACKING CAUSED BY RAPID TEMPERATURE TRANSITIONS AND THE SOLDERING PROCESS. IF SOLDER JOINT CRACKING OCCURS AND RESULTS IN AN OPEN CIRCUIT, THE TURN SIGNALS/HAZARD LAMPS BECOME INTERMITTENT OR INOPERATIVE.   CONSEQUENCE:  WHEN THE TURN SIGNALS ARE INOPERATIVE, THE DRIVER CANNOT USE THEM TO SIGNAL INTENT TO TURN THAT COULD RESULT IN A CRASH.    REMEDY:  DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE HAZARD WARNING SWITCH.

THE FREQUENCY OF THESE FAILURES RECENTLY BEGAN TO INCREASE, SO I RESEARCHED INFORMATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DISABLING THE ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM THAT FAILS TO DO LITTLE MORE THAN CAUSE A HEADACHE FOR MY MECHANICS.  TO MY DISMAY, I FOUND THAT CHEVY'S PASSLOCK SYSTEM CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN BY ANY METHOD SHORT OF A DO-IT-YOURSELF RE-WIRING PROJECT.  TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED TEMPORARILY, I COULD HAVE THE ENTIRE IGNITION SYSTEM REPLACED BY CHEVROLET FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF $450.  NOTE THAT I SAID TEMPORARY BECAUSE FROM THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THE REPAIR DONE, IT WILL NEED TO BE DONE AGAIN A FEW YEARS LATER AS THE IGNITION WEARS DOWN ONCE MORE.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED BY STORIES I HEAR ABOUT FURTHER PROBLEMS THAT DRIVERS HAVE HAD WITH THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM WHERE THE CAR ENGINE TURNS ITSELF OFF WHILE BEING DRIVEN AND REQUIRES THAT THE DRIVER PULL OVER TO RESTART THE VEHICLE.  I HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO ME.  GIVEN THAT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO EVERY MODEL OF CAR THAT HAS HAD THIS PASSLOCK SYSTEM IN PLACE SINCE PASSLOCK'S INCEPTION, I AM SURPRISED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECALLS MADE BY CHEVROLET IN ALMOST 10 YEARS.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT CHEVROLET IS MORE INTERESTED IN PROFITING FROM CONTINUALLY REPAIRING A SYSTEM THAT WE COULD JUST GET RID OF AND NOT IN THE SAFETY OF ITS CONSUMERS.

I DO SEE ON THIS SITE THAT THIS VEHICLE A 2000 CHEVY MALIBU HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED DUE TO FUEL PROBLEMS SO I HOPING THIS WAS LOOKED INTO PROPERLY AND BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE MY PUMP WAS CHANGED IN 2000 AND HAS BEEN GIVING ME PROBLEM SINCE 2002.

I THEN CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE BLACK BOX AND THAT I WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED THE USE OF THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

I THOUGHT GOING GMC WOULD GIVE ME A RELIABLE VEHICLE. I NOW HAVE TO PUT IN OVER $1,000 OR REPLACE THE ENGINE FOR $3,000 TO $4,000. WHEN I GO TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHILE I WILL KEEP THIS IN MIND!!!!!",

WITHIN A YEAR THE FANS SWITCH (LEVELS 1,2) AND LIGHTER STOPPED WORKING.  BOY GM IS SAVING LOTS MONEY NOW.  4.  WITHIN THE PAST YEAR I HAD FUEL PUMP FAILURE, NOTHING LIKE TRAVELING IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC DOING 75MPH AND CAR TOTALLY DIEING.  BOY GM HAS MADE ONE QUALITY CAR.  5.  THE LAST INSULT, MY FIRST AND LIKELY LAST GM PRODUCT IS WHEN I THOUGHT BOY I FINALLY GET SOMETHING FROM GM IN REGARDS TO ONE SMALL DEFECT, THE HAZARD SWITCH, I FIND OUT THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED BY THIS RECALL.

WHEN THE TURN SIGNALS ARE NOT FUNCTIONING IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND STRESSFUL TO MANEUVER THROUGH HEAVY TRAFFIC.  I HAVE OFTEN TIMES UPSET OTHER DRIVERS AFTER SWITCHING LANES WITHOUT HAVING A FUNCTIONING TURN SIGNAL.  WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST STARTED TO OCCUR (MORE THAN A YEAR AGO) I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM OF THE PROBLEM.  THE MECHANICS CHECKED THE TURN SIGNAL BULBS, AND AFTER FINDING NO PROBLEMS TOLD ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A LOOSE BULB SO IT SHOULD BE FIXED. THE NEXT DAY THE PROBLEM CONTINUED, AND SO I RETURNED TO THE DEALER.  THIS TIME THEY TOOK THE CAR INTO THE SHOP TO CHECK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY.  AFTER A DAY IN THE SHOP I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS AND THAT DURING A TEST DRIVE THE BLINKERS OPERATING CORRECTLY.  I TOOK THE CAR HOME, AND AS USUAL THE TURN SIGNALS CONTINUED TO WORK INTERMITTENTLY.

ON FRIDAY 10/7 I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 80 MPH WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY TURNED OFF. I COASTED TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER.  IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO CUT THE CAR BACK ON. AT WHICH TIME IT RESUMED DRIVING NORMALLY FOR ABOUT 10 MILES.  THEN IT STALLED AGAIN.  I TOWED THE CAR INTO TOWN AND DROVE IT TO A REPAIR SHOP. (YES, THE CAR DROVE NORMALLY AROUND TOWN).  THE REPAIR SHOP TESTED IT AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  WHEN I PICKED THE CAR UP I DROVE ABOUT 40 MILES (AGAIN AT GREATER THAN 75 MPH) AND THE CAR STALLED AGAIN.  IT STARTED BACK UP IN 2-3 MINUTES.  THEN 30 MILES LATER STALLED AGAIN. THIS TIME ON A PART OF THE HIGHWAY WHERE THERE WAS NO SHOULDER!  I COASTED THE CAR UNTIL THE SHOULDER REAPPEARED, PULLED ON TO IT AND RE-STARTED THE CAR.  THE CAR DOES NOT SHOW ANY SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM IN MY DAY-TO-DAY DRIVING AROUND TOWN.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT SUITABLE TO DRIVE FOR LONG DISTANCES OR AT HIGH SPEEDS DUE TO THIS CONDITION.  *LA",

I TOOK MY 6 MONTH OLD VEHICLE TO A DEALERSHIP AND THEY ADVISED THE FRONT ROTORS WERE WARPED.  THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS. LATER, THIS SAME DEFECT OCCURRED THREE MORE TIMES.  CHEVROLET ONLY MADE TWO MORE REPAIRS. EACH TIME THEY SIMPLY REPLACED THE ROTORS AND PLACED A SHIM BETWEEN THE AXLES AND THE ROTOR.

THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE IN SAN ANTONIO SIMPLY TRIED TO AVOID ME.  CHEVROLET\u0019S ON LINE COMPLAINT SYSTEM ALSO DID NOTHING.  AGAIN, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A RECALL FOR THIS BRAKE PROBLEM.  THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE SMALL (THIN) SIZE OF THE BRAKE ROTORS, WHICH CAUSED A FAILURE TO DISPERSE HEAT ADEQUATELY.  IF A DRIVER DRIVES INTO A RAIN STORM OR TO A CAR WASH AND THE HOT ROTORS COOL TOO RAPIDLY THEY WILL WARP.  PLEASE SEE GM SERVICE BULLETIN # 00-05-23-002, DATED FEBRUARY 2000 FOR MORE INFORMATION.  THE MADDENING THING ABOUT THIS SITUATION IS THAT CHEVROLET KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WHEN I PURCHASED MY CAR.  CHEVROLET/GM FAILED TO RECALL ALL THESE VEHICLES, AND EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WAS A FLAW IN THEIR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN, THEY LEFT THE PROBLEM IN THE HANDS AND POCKET BOOKS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.

MY WARRANTY IS GOOD UNTIL 36,000 MILES, SO I CONTACTED THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER (1-800-222-1020) AND TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS ISSUE WAS GOING TO BE COVERED AFTER THE WARRANTY RAN OUT DUE TO THE TIMELY CHANGING OF THE ROTORS SO MANY TIMES IN SO LITTLE MILEAGE.  THE REPLACEMENTS WERE ON 4/11/00 (5,440), 8/31/00 (10,775), AND 5/8/01 (18,394).  EACH OF THESE TIMES THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THAT MY BRAKES AND BRAKE PADS WERE FINE, BUT THAT THE ROTORS WERE WARPED.  THE CHEVY # TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SOMETHING I HAVE DONE OR MY DRIVING HABITS/CONDITIONS.  I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IN THAT MY BRAKES HAVEN'T WORN OUT YET, BUT THE ROTORS KEEP GOING BAD.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR PASSING THE BLAME, INSTEAD OF CORRECTING THE PROBLEM OR EXTENDING THE COVERAGE OF AN ISSUE THAT IS COUNTLESSLY REPEATED ON YOUR SITE AND THE NEWSGROUPS FROM 1997 TO PRESENT.  CHEVY HAS THE SLOGAN, \"CHEVY, WE'LL BE THERE.\"  THEY DON'T SHOW THE FINE PRINT OF:  \"WE'LL BE THERE, UNLESS WE BLAME YOU AND DON'T DECIDE TO RESOLVE A KNOWN ISSUE.\"  I WOULD LIKE FEEDBACK ON THIS ISSUE, ESPECIALLY SINCE I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A COVERED ISSUE, AND DON'T BELIEVE THAT I AM CAUSING A PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY ROUTINE EVERY 5-8,000 MILES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS EXPERIENCING.
