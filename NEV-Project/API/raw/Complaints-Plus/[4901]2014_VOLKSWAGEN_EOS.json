WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPAIR, REPLACE, OR REFUND OUR CAR FREE OF CHARGE AND IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS ALREADY BEEN EXCEEDED.

THE CAR WAS DRIVEN HOME AT 10 MPH AND PARKED.  I DROVE IT AROUND THE BLOCK APPROX. 30 MINUTES LATER AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING FROM 25 MPH ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  AGAIN, THE SEATBELT DID NOT RESTRAIN ME WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFTED.  IN BOTH CASES, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED, AND THE TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTION INDICATOR CAME ON.    HAD THIS OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEED THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC!  THE SUDDEN DOWNSHIFT WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE CAUSED THE CAR TO BECOME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL AND ANY VEHICLES NEARBY COULD EASILY HAVE CREATED A MULTI-VEHICLE ACCIDENT.  *TR",
