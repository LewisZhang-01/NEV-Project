THE NEXT DAY(OR WEHN I LEFT THE RV PARK) IT WOULD WORK FINE. LIKEWISE, WHEN I HAD IT LOOKED AT FOR SERVICE IT WOULD WORK FINE. I GOT ON THE INTERNET ON SOME RV BOARDS AND FOUND OUT THAT OTHERS WERE HAVING PROBLEMS-ONE WAS LOCKED DOWN TOTALLY IN THE YARD, ANOTHER WOULD NOT HOLD, BUT THE WORSE WAS A LOCKDOWN WHILE GOING DOWN THE ROAD! I COULD HANDLE THE MINOR ONES BUT NOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE \"GOING DOWN THE ROAD LOCKDOWN\". THAT COULD BE SERIOUS! THE INCIDENT DATE IS NOT CORRECT BECAUSE I CAN'T RECALL EXACTLY THE TWO TIMES I HAD PROBLEMS BUT HAD TO FILL IN THE FIELD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.*AK",
