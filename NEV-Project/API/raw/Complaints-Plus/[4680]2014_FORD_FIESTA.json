Cooling system visual inspection was performed we found the coolant bottle full. We tried to pull spark plugs to do leak down test and found three of the plugs are seized and not coming out.

The first two times there were warning lights, but now no warnings are showing. To put this issue into perspective, I have only owned this car for 2.5 years, and it was purchased from a dealership used (however the dealership never mentioned the rampant transmission issues or informed me of the recent lawsuits about the Ford Fiesta). The replacement of the TCM was completed on September 16, 2021. This repair took a month to complete. Now, after being repaired for a mere 2 months, the car is exhibiting the exact same behaviors as both previous occurrences. Both previous repairs were completed by professionals, and should have fixed the issue. However, the transmission issues continue to reoccur. At this point, the car has become a major safety concern. The transmission issues are becoming extremely frequent after the \"repairs\" and \"replacements\", and are sudden in occurrence while driving. There is no warning the gear will slip into what seems to be \"neutral\", or that it will fail to accelerate. Additionally, the car will randomly fail to respond to gas pedal presses, especially at intersections or on hills. I fear that this car is dangerous to drive, as the issues are so sudden in nature. I have tried to settle the issue with Ford directly, but they have ignored me every step of the way. At one point, they said they would try to start a buy-back process, but then refused to return my follow-up calls.",

I DID NOT COMPLAIN AS HE WAS MY SOLE MAIN GUIDANCE AND I THOUGHT I COULD TRUST JIM. ON 08/09/2013, I PURCHASE A BRAND NEW FORD FIESTA TRADING IN THE 2012 FORD FOCUS.

THE CAR'S TIRES SPIN WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A FULL STOP THEN THE VEHICLE JUMPS OUT FORWARD. THE CAR RIDES ROUGH, IT BUCKS, IT MISSES, IT MAKES NOISES, IT SHUDDERS.     THIS TIME I AM NOT VERY HAPPY NOR PLEASANT WITH MR. JIM SNEAD.  I WAS A TEACHER, A WIDOW W/ TWO KIDS STILL DEPENDENT ON ME AND HERE HE SELLS ME ANOTHER 'CRAP', TERRIFYING CAR THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF ITS OWN.  OF COURSE, ACCORDING TO MR. SNEAD, IT IS MY DRIVING--NOT THE CAR.     I NOTICE THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT WRITING UP MY COMPLAINTS EVERY TIME I BRING IT IN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION-JUST LIKE THEY LEFT IT OUT OF MY COMPLAINTS WITH THE FOCUS.THE FIESTA RECEIVES ITS FIRST OF 3 TRANSMISSIONS A YEAR AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR ON 09/23/2014.  WHILE I AM DRIVING AROUND W/ THE SERVICE MANAGER SO HE CAN FEEL HOW TERRIBLE THE CAR RUNS, HE ADMITS TO ME THE CAR IS A BUNCH OF JUNK AND I NEED TO START READING UP ON IT.  NOW THE FIESTA IS IN THE SHOP OFTEN AND MR. SNEAD AND I ARE NOT VERY FRIENDLY.I HAVE ALL THE SERVICE RECORDS, BUT I HAVE TO WRITE IN THE CAR IS RUNNING RAGGFED AS THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT PUT IT IN THE REPORT.     I WANT MR.

IN JANUARY OF 2018,  I HAD STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT ON A BUSY STREET IN COLORADO SPRINGS, CO WHERE I LIVE.  THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND MY CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF 1ST GEAR OR GO FASTER THAN 5 MPH.  I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND AFTER SITTING THERE FOR 20 MINUTES AND SHIFTED THE GEARS BOX FROM PARK TO NEUTRAL TO DRIVE, I FINALLY GOT BACK ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR SHIFTED BUT VERY SLOWLY.      THIS WAS ON A SUNDAY.  THE NEXT DAY I MADE AN SERVICE APPOINTMENT WITH PHIL LONG FORD WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  THEY KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND TOLD ME IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    I TOOK THE CAR IN TO THEM THAT WEEK AND THEY RAN THE VIN AND IT WAS NOT IN THE WARRANTY BATCH TO REPLACE THE CLUTCHES.  THEY CALLED FORD AND ASKED THEM TO COVER THE REPAIR.  FORD DECLINED.  THE SERVICE ADVISER GAVE ME FORD'S 800 CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE.  THEY BUILT A CASE BASED ON MY INFORMATION.  A DAY LATER I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AND EMAIL TELLING ME THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND FORD WOULD NOT GIVE ME ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.    PHIL LONG FORD ESTIMATED THE REPAIR AT $2,200.00 BUT SINCE FORD WOULD NOT COVER THE COST AND I PURCHASED THE FIESTA FROM THEM, THEY DID THE REPAIR FOR $1,500.00 OUT OF POCKET COST.  I'M JUST A SIMPLE WORKING MAN AND CAN'T AFFORD THOSE TYPES OF REPAIRS.  I HAD TO PUT THE CHARGE ON MY CREDIT CARD.

THE DEALER DID A TOTAL OF 3 PRESSURE CHECKS ON THE CAR WITH NO LEAKS. I ASKED IF HE COULD CHECK THE EXHAUST FOR COOLANT OUT THE TAIL PIPE.

AT THE TIME I WAS COMMUTING 120 MILES DAILY TO SUPPORT A PROJECT. I WAS VERY EARLY ON THE CAR BEGAN TO JERK AND SHAKE. I RETUNED IT FIRST FOR A DEFECTIVE TIRE, DEFECTIVE BACKUP SENSOR AND UNSAFE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY. KINGS FORD (CINCINNATI OH) REPLACED THE TIRE (I HAD TO PAY FOR THE TIRE), REPLACED THE BACKUP SENSOR (WARRANTY) AND 'RESET/UPDATED' THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLS FIRMWARE.    AFTER THIS, I RETUNED THE VEHICLE MULTIPLY TIMES FOR UNSAFE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY. AFTER ABOUT TWO MORE TIMES OF KINGS FORD 'RESETTING/UPDATING' THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLS FIRMWARE THEY FINALLY REPLACED THE CLUTCHES. THIS WAS AT 20,000 MILES.   SINCE THEN I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO KINGS FORD TWO MORE TIMES FOR UNSAFE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY. EACH TIME THEY 'RESET/UPDATED' THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLS FIRMWARE.    YESTERDAY, I CALLED FORD ROADSIDE TO PICKUP THE CAR AND RETURN IT TO KINGS FORD DUE TO UNSAFE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY. ALSO, I HAVE ANOTHER FAULTY TIRE AND THE AIR HANDING ACTUATORS IN THE DASH ARE MAKING GRINDING SOUNDS.  I HAVE HAD MULTIPLY NEAR ACCIDENTS DUE TO THE VEHICLES UNSAFE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY. THE VEHICLE HAS DISABLED ITSELF IN HIGH SPEED INTERSTATE TRAFFIC. I HAD NAVIGATE THE CAR FROM THE FAST LANE TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER WITHOUT ANY AVAILABLE POWER. I NARROWLY MISSED A SET OF LARGE COMMERCIAL TRUCKS! ONCE AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I HAD TO CYCLE THE IGNITION BEFORE THE CAR WOULD RESPOND TO ACCELERATOR INPUTS.

DIRECTLY AHEAD OF OUR DAUGHTER WAS A REFRIGERATOR TRUCK. OUR DAUGHTER WAS NOT ABLE TO STOP QUICKLY ENOUGH AND STRUCK THE BACK OF THE REFRIGERATOR TRUCK. THE SPEED LISTED ABOVE IS AN ESTIMATE. NO ONE IN THE OTHER VEHICLES WERE HURT, NOR DID THEIR CARS SUSTAIN REPAIRABLE DAMAGE. MY DAUGHTER'S CAR WAS STOPPING STRAIGHT AT THE POINT OF COLLISION AND STRUCK THE BACK OF THE TRUCK SQUARE. THE OFFICER AT THE SCENE SUGGESTED SHE BE CHECKED OUT IN THE ER.  MY DAUGHTER SUSTAINED SOFT TISSUES INJURIES AND BRUISES. AFTER SOME TIME WITH THE CHIROPRACTOR SHE SHOULD BE FINE. MY QUESTION/CONCERN DEALS WITH THE AIR BAG SYSTEM. THE DRIVER KNEE AIRBAG DEPLOYED, THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG DID NOT. IS THAT POSSIBLE? ARE THERE SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LOWER BAG TO DEPLOY WITHOUT DEPLOYING THE STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG? THE SEAT BELT DID STOP HER, ALTHOUGH IT LEFT A LARGE RED MARK ON HER SHOULDER. IF THE SYSTEM WORKED CORRECTLY THAT IS FINE. WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WITH EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOTHING FAULTY IN HER CAR. IF NEEDED WE CAN SUPPLY PHOTOS TO SHOW THE EXACT DAMAGE. THE VEHICLE IS AT THE DEALERSHIP NOW FOR REPAIRS, SO THE MILEAGE IS A GOOD ESTIMATE. THANK-YOU FOR YOUR HELP.",

DUE TO BEING IN THE MILITARY, I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF  DECEMBER 2014 TO TAKE MY CAR TO FORD. THEY TESTED THE VEHICLE AND SAID THAT THEY RECOGNIZED THE SHUDDER I COMPLAINED ABOUT AND THEY RESET THE COMPUTER IN THE VEHICLE. ON THE REPORT THEY SAID THE VEHICLE WAS IN FACTORY SPECS, SO AS A RESULT OF THAT REPORT, THEY DIDN'T ORDER NEW CLUTCHES AND SEALS WHICH WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THOSE NEW PARTS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. INSTEAD THEY JUST DID A TEMPORARY FIX BY RESETTING THE COMPUTER IN ORDER TO GET ME OUT THE DOOR. I PICKED UP THE CAR DECEMBER 5TH 2014 AND 6 DAYS LATER THE SHUDDER RETURNED. NOW I HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP ON MONDAY MARCH 30TH 2015 AND THE AGENT THERE SAID THAT IF THE TEST COMES BACK THAT THE CAR IS IN FACTORY SPECS THEY WONT MAKE ANY REPAIRS ON THE VEHICLE  AND CALL ME TO PICK UP MY BROKEN VEHICLE.
