THE TRAILER, WITH MOTORCYCLES LEFT THE ROADWAY AND TUMBLED INTO A ROADSIDE DITCH.  THE BOTH MOTORCYCLES WERE TOTALED AND THE TRAILER WAS DAMAGED BEYOND COST EFFECTIVE REPAIR. THE NECK OF THE TRAILER WHERE 3 ROUND STRUCTURAL STEEL TUBES COME TOGETHER, AFT OF THE COUPLER COMPLETELY SEVERED.  THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS VISIBLE SIGNS OF A DEFECT PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, NOR DID THE TRAILER FEEL WEAK WHEN IT WAS MOVED BY HAND AND PULLED TO THE TOW VEHICLE.  THE TUBES BROKE NEAR WHERE THEY WERE WELDED THROUGH A TRIANGULAR COLLAR PIECE THAT THE TUBES PASSED THROUGH.
