THE VEHICLE HAS SLIGHTLY HIGH MILES (APPROX. 121,000), IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MAINTAINED ACCORDINGLY AND HAS WORKED GREAT UNTIL RECENTLY. WHILE DRIVING TO WORK, VIA HIGHWAY, FIFTH GEAR MYSTERIOUSLY WOULD NOT STAY ENGAGED. ONCE PLACED INTO FIFTH, THE GEAR WOULD POP BACK OUT. IN ORDER TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION IN FIFTH GEAR, IT WAS NECESSARY TO PHYSICALLY HOLD THE STICK INTO POSITION, OTHERWISE IT WOULD POP OUT. UPON RESEARCH INTO THE PROBLEM, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT TOYOTA HAS NOT RECALLED FIFTH GEAR, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS. THE ONLY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE ANOMALY BY TOYOTA FOUND WAS THAT OF A \"RE-ISSUE\", NOT A RECALL. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE HAZARDOUS TO THE AUTOMOBILES' DRIVER, AS WELL AS OTHERS ON THE ROAD DUE TO AN UNEXPECTED JERK CAUSED BY THE GEAR NOT ENGAGING. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT ARISES IS THE FACT THAT ATTENTION IS DIVERTED AWAY FROM DRIVING. I HAVE HEARD THAT TOYOTA IS NOTORIOUS FOR ISSUING WHAT I'VE HEARD CALLED \"SILENT RECALLS\". IF THIS PROBLEM FALLS INTO SUCH A CATEGORY IT IS ASSUMED THAT TOYOTA DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THE HAZARD AND PROBLEM AND WOULD PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE GEAR, RIGHT?     SINCE THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT, THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AND THE FIFTH GEAR WAS REPLACED OUT OF POCKET. MANY ISSUES HAVE COME TO FRUITION SINCE THE REPLACEMENT, BUT THAT IS A CONCERN BETTER BROUGHT UP WITH THE BBB REGARDING THE \"TRANSMISSION SPECIALISTS\" RATHER THAN WITH NHTSA.
