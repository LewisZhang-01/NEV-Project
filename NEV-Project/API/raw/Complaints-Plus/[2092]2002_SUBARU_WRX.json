AS I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER, WHICH SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUE, DOES NOT USUALLY OCCUR FOR EXTENSIVE PERIODS OF TIME, I HAD NOT PURSUED THE ISSUE FOR RESOLUTION BY TILL LAST YEAR WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS NOTICED TO BE PREDICTABLY CHRONIC IN THE WINTER SEASON.  I CONTACTED SOA VIA EMAIL AT THAT TIME ASKING THEM FOR ADVICE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND WAS ADVISED TO HAVE A DEALERSHIP INVESTIGATE IT.  AS THEY DID NOT INDICATE THIS WOULD BE PAID FOR BY THEM AND I DID NOT HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PURSUE THIS INDEPENDENTLY, I DID NOT TAKE THE ISSUE FURTHER. HOWEVER, THE ISSUE IS RECURRING DAILY NOW IN THIS PARTICULARLY COLD WINTER SO I HAVE CONTACTED THEM AGAIN TO FURTHER PURSUE THIS WITH THEM.  MY INTERNET RESEARCH, THE TSB AND THE MANY COMPLAINTS ON NHTSAS SITE CONCERNING THE ISSUE SEEM TO SUPPORT THE WRX OWNER COMMUNITY'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE REMEDIATED BY SOA, FREE OF OWNER CHARGES, AS A RECALL.  WOULD YOU PLEASE ADVISE IF NHTSA WILL BE PURSUING THIS WITH SOA AS A RECALL ISSUE?  ALSO, I WAS INTERESTED IN READING THE DETAILED TSBS AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE BUT CANNOT RETRIEVE THEM.  SOA CHARGES A FEE TO DOWNLOAD THEM.  IS THIS STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND IS THERE A WAY I CAN GET THEM FROM NHTSA WITHOUT FEES? *TR",

THE ODOR NOW OCCURS WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW 35 F. A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, THE TEMPS WERE IN THE TEENS F AND THE ODOR GOT REALLY BAD. AFTER DRIVING FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, WHITE FUMES STARTED POURING OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOOD AND FROM THE SCOOP. THERE IS SO MUCH FUEL LEAKING NOW THAT IT'S BEING VAPORIZED INTO A WHITE SMOKE AND SPEWS OUT OF THE ENGINE FOR ABOUT 1 OR 2 MINUTES. I OPENED THE HOOD TO CONFIRM THERE IS NO FIRE, WHICH THERE WAS NOT. BUT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF WHITE FUMES WHICH RESEMBLED SMOKE BUT AGAIN, NO FIRE.  A FRIEND WHO WAS DRIVING IN ANOTHER CAR, 3 CARS BEHIND ME, REPORTED THAT THE GAS SMELL FROM MY CAR WAS SO BAD THEY HAD TO PULL BACK.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, VAPORIZED FUEL WILL IGNITE AT 536 DEGREES F. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE FOR THE TURBO CHARGER ON THIS CAR TO GET THAT HOT AFTER SOME DRIVING. WITH THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FULL OF WHITE GAS FUMES AND THE CABIN FILL OF A POWERFUL RAW GAS SMELL, IT ONLY STANDS TO REASON THAT THIS COULD CATCH FILE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND THE PASSENGER CABIN.

LOOKING ONLINE FOR SOLUTIONS, I CAME ACROSS NUMEROUS FORUMS ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. MOST NOTABLY THIS ONE: HTTP://FORUMS.NASIOC.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?S=&THREADID=138069&HIGHLIGHT=FUEL+SMELL. I ALSO FOUND SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN 09-36-03 DATED 04/01/03.    SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN 09-36-03    THIS BULLETIN STATES:  SOME 2002 MODEL IMPREZA WRX (2.0L TURBO) MAY EXPERIENCE A FUEL SMELL IN  COLD WEATHER (TEMPERATURE <14 DEGREES F) FROM THE RUBBER HOSE CONNECTOR, LOCATED UNDER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, BETWEEN TWO DIRECT FUEL-FEED METAL LINES TO THE INJECTORS. THE CHANGING OF THE PIPE AND HOSE SIZE WAS ADOPTED, STARTING WITH ENGINE NUMBER 673467 TO BETTER ALIGN THE TWO FUEL LINES. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY SHORTENING THE FUEL PIPE AND LENGTHENING THE HOSE BOTH BY 30MM. TO COMPLETE THIS SERVICE PROCEDURE, YOU MUST REPLACE THE FUEL PIPE ASSEMBLY AND HOSE AS A SET.    READING THIS IT IS EVIDENT OF THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:    THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN SOME 2002 MODEL IMPREZA WRXS    THIS DESIGN FLAW IS EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS APPARENTLY CHANGED FOR FUTURE MODELS AFTER THE PROBLEM WAS REALIZED.  USING THE SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN AND THE ONLINE FORUMS, I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE A FUEL LEAK IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AT THE LOCATION DETERMINED.   THIS FUEL LEAK WAS FURTHER CONFIRMED BY A SUBARU DEALER AFTER ASKED BY SUBARU OF AMERICA TO GET IT LOOKED AT BY ONE OF THEIR DEALERS FOR THEM TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS ISSUE WHILE I WAS STILL WORKING WITH THEM TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED.

DURING THE WINTER OF 2005, I BELIEVED THE SMELL WAS NOTHING MAJOR BUT WHEN IT RECURRED IN 2006, I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I DID RESEARCH ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE, ALONG WITH SUBARU WEB FORUMS (WWW.I-CLUB.COM; WWW.NASIOC) AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH THIS MODEL.  I TOOK MY CAR TO MY LOCAL SUBARU ON 11/13/06. IT SITS OVERNIGHT SO THEY CAN CHECK THE CAR ON THE MORNING OF THE 14TH WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS COLD ENOUGH FOR THE PROBLEM TO ARISE. THEY DO FIND A GAS LEAK CONCURRENT WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (# 09-36-03 DATED 04-01-03). THE TSB REPLACES THE FUEL PIPE ASSEMBLY AND HOSE AS A SET. THE LEAK COMES FROM THE RUBBER HOSE CONNECTOR, LOCATED UNDER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, BETWEEN THE TWO DIRECT FUEL-FEED METAL LINES TO THE INJECTORS. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS COLD, THE METAL FUEL LINE CONTRACTS MORE THAN THE RUBBER FUEL LINE, THUS CREATING A \"HOLE\" FOR THE GAS TO LEAK OUT OF. THE REPAIR WAS QUOTED AT $380.38.    I AM OUTRAGED OVER THIS REPAIR FOR TWO REASONS: I AM NOT HAPPY WITH HAVING TO SPEND MONEY ON A REPAIR THAT IS ESSENTIAL A DESIGN FLAW. THOUGH I AM PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD, I FEEL THAT THIS REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED BY SUBARU AS IT IS NOT A \"REPAIR;\" IT IS A FIX FOR THEIR MISTAKE. I AM MOST UPSET, HOWEVER, OVER THE FACT THAT SUBARU AND THE NHTSA HAVE NOT CREATED A RECALL CAMPAIGN FOR THIS FIX. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AS LEAKING FUEL IN A HOT ENGINE COMPARTMENT IS DANGEROUS. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT COULD PROVE TO BE FATAL FOR SOME OWNERS. I HOWEVER AM FORTUNATE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME.  I ASK THAT BOTH SUBARU OF AMERICA AND THE NHTSA TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM AND INITIATE A RECALL BEFORE ANY DEATHS OR INJURIES OCCUR. *JB",

WHEN I RETURNED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER, I DETECTED A STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE BEFORE GETTING IN. THE FUMES INSIDE WERE UNBEARABLE AND I HAD TO AIR OUT THE CAR BEFORE DRIVING, BUT THE ORDER PERSISTED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. I LEFT FOR HOUSTON THAT EVENING AND THOUGHT THE FUMES WERE JUST A ONE TIME OCCURRENCE.  LAST NIGHT I VISITED A FRIEND FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS. IT RARELY GETS VERY COLD IN HOUSTON, BUT AT 9 P.M. LAST NIGHT WHEN I LEFT THE TEMPERATURE WAS PROBABLY JUST A LITTLE ABOVE FREEZING. WHEN I STARTED THE CAR ALL APPEARED NORMAL, BUT WHEN I  TURNED ON THE HEATER, THE SMELL OF GAS WAS OVERWHELMING. I AIRED OUT THE CAR WHILE DRIVING, BUT THE GOT THE SAME RESULT EVERY TIME I TRIED TO USE THE HEATER. THE CAR REEKED OF RAW GASOLINE WHEN I PARKED IT AFTER THE 1.5 MILE DRIVE HOME.    I GOT ON-LINE AFTER I GOT HOME AND FOUND OUT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON COMPLAINT AND THAT TSB HAD BEEN ISSUED.

AS REGARDS THE LEAKING OF FUEL INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, IT IS A MORE SERIOUS HAZARD THAN INDICATED IN YOUR IMPOVERISHED DATA.  IN MANY CASES, THE FUEL DOES NOT CEASE TO LEAK WHEN THE CAR HAS WARMED UP, AND WILL CONTINUE TO LEAK FUEL STEADILY.  THIS PRODUCES PUDDLES ON THE HOT INTAKE MANIFOLD, AND TOXIC CONDITIONS FOR PASSENGERS AND BYSTANDERS.     AS MENTIONED IN SUBARU TSB 09-36-03, UNDER COLD WEATHER CONDITIONS, FUEL WILL LEAK FROM A RUBBER-METAL JOINT IN THE FUEL LINE.  THE REASON GIVEN IS THAT THE STIFFENING OF THE RUBBER IN COLD WEATHER DEPRIVES THE MATERIAL OF THE RESILIENCY NEEDED TO PROVIDE STRAIN RELIEF FOR THE HIGH PRESSURE RUBBER-METAL JOINT, THIS STRESSING THE JOINT, AND ALLOWING FUEL TO LEAK FROM IT.

ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2004, WHILE DRIVING DOWNHILL AT ABOUT 30 TO 35 MPH ON DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAN PAVEMENT, A TRUCK DRIVING IN FRONT OF ME BRAKED GRADUALLY. I HIT MY BRAKES TO MAINTAIN A DISTANCE, BUT IT WAS A SECTION OF RIPPLED PAVEMENT AND THE ABS SYSTEM SHUT OFF THE BRAKES SO COMPLETELY FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS. MY CAR WAS ACTUALLY PICKING UP SPEED DUE TO THE DOWNHILL. I AM SURE THAN IN ANY OTHER CAR I'VE HAD, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ANY TROUBLE SLOWING DOWN.    I AVOIDED REAR-ENDING THE TRUCK BY SLOWING THE CAR WITH AGGRESSIVE ENGINE BRAKING. I ALSO STEERED TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHERE THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC AT THAT MOMENT AND THE PAVEMENT WAS CLEANER, SO I COULD SLOW DOWN.    ANOTHER TIME I REAR-ENDED A VEHICLE THAT STOPPED IN FRONT OF A POTHOLE, ALTHOUGH DAMAGE WAS MINOR. I'VE ALSO HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF SCARY NEAR - MISSES WITH REAR-ENDING OTHER VEHICLES, AND ON A FEW OCCASIONS SLID OUT INTO INTERSECTIONS WITH FROST HEAVES LEADING UP TO A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT, BECAUSE MY BRAKING SPACE ESTIMATE WAS FAR LESS THAN I ACTUALLY NEEDED.    I RECENTLY REPLACED ALL BRAKE PADS AND DISCS. THE REAR PADS FIT IN THE CALIPERS SO TIGHTLY I HAD TO POUND THEM OUT WITH A HAMMER AND PUNCH. BOTH PADS AND ROTORS WERE WORN VERY UNEVENLY. REPLACEMENT REAR PADS FIT IN THE SAME WAY. THEN I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE FIT, SO I GROUND DOWN THE TABS TO GET A GOOD SNUG FIT RATHER THAN AN INTERFERENCE FIT AND JAMMING, SO THEY SLIPPED INTO PLACE NORMALLY.    AFTER MAKING THIS CHANGE TO MY BRAKES, THEY WORK VERY WELL.    I NEARLY SOLD THE CAR DUE TO THIS ISSUE, BUT INSTEAD DROVE IT FOR A WHILE WITH THE ABS SYSTEM DISABLED.

THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 10 TIMES NOW, EACH TIME IT SEEMS TO GET WORSE.  THE NHTSA HAS ALREADY INVESTIGATED SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN OTHER 2002 MODELS (CASE PE04002), AND SUBARU HAS ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (09-36-03) WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON PARTS REQUIRED TO FIX IT.  UNFORTUNATELY SUBARU IS UNWILLING TO DO THIS WORK FREE OF CHARGE, QUOTES TO REPAIR THIS ARE BETWEEN $300 AND $500 DOLLARS, AND NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD IT.  SINCE THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT IN MANY VEHICLES, I AM ASKING FOR THE NHTSA'S HELP IN CLASSIFYING THIS AS A MANDATORY RECALL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:    1) FUEL IS LEAKING OUT OF A RUBBER HOSE ONTO THE ENGINE, WHICH COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE A FIRE, SUBARU HAS ADMITTED THIS MUCH IN THEIR TSB.  2) THE VAPORS FROM THIS LEAK ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERWHELM AN INDIVIDUAL AND/OR MAKE THEM NAUSEOUS, WHICH COULD MAKE THEM LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  3) SMALL CHILDREN (MANY OF US HAVE ONE) CANNOT BE PUT INSIDE THE CAR DURING THIS TIME AS THE VAPORS ARE MUCH TOO STRONG FOR THEIR SMALL BODIES.  WAITING OUTSIDE THE CAR IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION AS THIS USUALLY HAPPENS DURING COLD WEATHER,  8 DEGREES TODAY WITH A -20 DEGREE WINDCHILL.

PROBLEM HAS BEEN THERE SINCE CAR WAS NEW, WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT IT WITH MY DEALER I WAS INFORMED THAT \"ALL WRXS DO THAT, ITS NORMAL\" BUT AFTER TALKING WITH SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME CAR I CAN TELL YOU THAT ALTHOUGH WE ALL MIGHT EXPERIENCE IT, ITS NOT NORMAL AT ALL AND QUITE SCARY.  AS AN EXPERIMENT I FOUND A PARKING LOT WITH SOME BUMPS ON IT THAT WOULD CAUSE THE ABS TO GO NUTTY, I THEN PULLED THE ABS FUSE AND WENT OVER THE SAME PART OF THE PARKING LOT AT THE SAME SPEED AND I COULD GET TONS MORE BRAKING FORCE WITHOUT LOCKING UP THE WHEELS THAN I COULD WITH THE ABS ON, SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY SCREWY HERE.  *AK",

THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 35-40 MPH AND BEGAN BRAKING WITH A LIGHT-MODERATE PEDAL PRESSURE.

UPON HITTING THIS DROP OFF AND MAINTAINING PEDAL PRESSURE, THE ABS BRIEFLY CYCLED (FELT AS A VIBRATION IN THE BRAKE PEDAL) AND THEN THE CAR STOPPED DECELERATING FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS. IT WAS AS IF I'D LIFTED COMPLETELY OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL, YET I HAD NOT. ONCE I REALIZED I WASN'T GOING TO STOP, I RELEASED THE PEDAL AND REAPPLIED IT VERY QUICKLY.

IN BOTH INSTANCES I HIT THE BRAKES QUICK AND HARD, LET UP MOMENTARILY, THEN REAPPLIED.  IN BOTH CASES IT WAS ON THE SECOND APPLICATION THAT THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR SEEMED TO BE ALMOST COASTING FREELY.  LUCKILY, IN BOTH INSTANCES I HAD AN ESCAPE ROUTE.    THE FIRST FAILURE WAS ON NORTHBOUND GEORGIA AVE., APPROACHING A RED LIGHT.  THE WEATHER WAS MILD, PAVEMENT CLEAR, DRY AND SMOOTH.  SPEED UPON INITIAL BRAKE APPLICATION WAS APPROX. 45 MPH. (ANOTHER NORTHBOUND DRIVER PULLED IN FRONT OF ME WITHOUT WARNING).  TIRES WERE BRIDGESTONE RE730'S.  BRAKES STOCK.    THE SECOND TIME WAS ON NORTHBOUND I-270 AT EXIT 31.  AGAIN, THE WEATHER WAS MILD AND THE PAVEMENT WAS SMOOTH AND DRY.  SPEED UPON INITIAL BRAKE APPLICATION WAS APPROX. 65 MPH.  (A DRIVER ENTERING I-270 ABRUPTLY MERGED ACROSS 3 LANES INTO LANE 1 DOING ALL OF ABOUT 25 MPH).   TIRES WERE FIRESTONE SZ-50EP'S.  BRAKES STOCK.    AFTER THE SECOND INCIDENT I INSTALLED NEW FRONT BRAKE PADS, HAWK HP-PLUS.  NOT THAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HELP WITH THE ABS PROBLEM, I JUST WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STOCK PADS.  DURING THE INSTALLATION I BLED THE BRAKES AND FOUND A LOT OF _AIR_ IN THE SYSTEM.  BY A LOT, I DON'T MEAN LITTLE BUBBLES, I MEAN A 2-3 INCHES OF AIR IN THE CLEAR BLEEDER TUBE.  SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEMS.    THE ABS DOES CONTINUE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE, ACTIVATING EVEN ON SLIGHTLY RIPPLED PAVEMENT WHEN BRAKING MODERATELY FROM 25-30 MPH.

WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE BRAKE PEDAL DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY AND THERE IS NO PULSING ACTION.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS THREE TIMES. THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION. I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, AND WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES, THE PEDAL DROPPED SEVERAL INCHES AND THERE WAS LITTLE, IF ANY BRAKING ACTION. LUCKILY, I HAD A GREEN LIGHT AND I WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE TURN WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE SECOND TIME I WAS TRAVELING ON A GRAVEL ROAD. I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 15-20 MPH, AND AS I CAME AROUND A CORNER I ENCOUNTERED A TRUCK THAT WAS DRIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. AGAIN, I APPLIED THE BRAKES WITHOUT ANY EFFECT. I WAS FORCED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION AND GO INTO THE DITCH TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. AFTER THAT, I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALER. I WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE BEHAVIOR ONCE WITH A TECHNICIAN IN THE CAR. WE WERE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 15-20 MPH AND I APPLIED THE BRAKES ON A ROUGH SECTION OF PAVEMENT. THE ABS PULSED SEVERAL TIMES, THEN IT STOPPED PULSING FOR 2-3 SECONDS, AND THEN IT STARTED PULSING AGAIN. DURING THE PERIOD WHEN IT STOPPED PULSING, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS SOFT AND DROPPED 1-2 INCHES. THE TECHNICIAN TRIED TO REPLICATE IT WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE TECHNICIAN INSPECTED THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CHECKING FOR DIAGNOSTIC CODES, BUT COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  *AK",
