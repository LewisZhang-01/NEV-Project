It also shifts like this when going back and forth between 4th and 5th. Doing a full trans flush seems to make the issue slightly better but always comes back to being violent again. After speaking with multiple mechanics they all recommend driving it till the trans fails or buying a new car. My car has 213k highway miles on it and the issue has been there since 100k miles (about 3 years ago). Another odd thing about it is that if you shift into manual mode while coasting to a stop and then shifting back to automatic after you exit the complete stop, it avoids the hard slam. The vehicle also shifts fine in manual mode from 4th to 5th. After doing research in group forums ( www.cruzetalk.com ) there are a ton of threads with this EXACT issue.",

MY CRUZE ENTERED \"LIMP MODE\" IN JULY WITH 54,000 MILES ON IT. THE TURBO FAILED TO WORK WHILE MERGING ONTO THE FREEWAY AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. IT WAS SHIFTING INTO 4TH GEAR WITH HIGH RPM TO KEEP FREEWAY SPEED. WHEN DIAG BOX WAS LATER PLUGGED IN, THE CODE CAME BACK AS \"P0299\" - TURBO UNDERBOOST. I ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE THE SENSOR (CODE CAME BACK) AND SOLENOID (CODE BACK AGAIN) AS THEY CAME UP OFTEN IN RESEARCH WHEN LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION. TURBO WORKED FINE FOR A MONTH AND THEN QUIT AGAIN WITH THE SAME CODE AND MY CAR IN LIMP MODE AGAIN. I FILED A COMPLAINT THROUGH GM AND THEY MANAGED TO GET THE PART THAT WAS BACKORDERED INDEFINITELY DUE TO FACTORY WORKERS BEING ON STRIKE. APPARENTLY, GM CUT THEIR HEALTHCARE OVERNIGHT. I'D STRIKE TOO.  THE SERVICE PRINTOUT I RECEIVED AFTER REPLACEMENT STATED THAT THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TURBO:  \"INSPECTED FOR OIL INTRUSION, NONE FOUND  WASTEGATE SOLENOID CONNECTOR MISSING RETAINER - DOES NOT AFFECT FUNCTION.  BYPASS VALVE OPENS AND CLOSES WHEN COMMANDED.  NO AIR INDUCTION RESTRICTION FOUND. RECOMMEND TURBO FOR FAILED BOOST COTROL TEST\"  THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A FAULTY PART, AND AN EXPENSIVE ONE AT $1,501.86, THAT I PAID FOR BUT DID NOT BREAK. NOT TO MENTION THE SENSOR AND SOLENOID REPLACED PRIOR.  MY CAR IS \"FIXED\", AND RUNS, BUT THIS IS STILL AN ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE IN GENERAL, AND THE TURBO SHOULD BE RECALLED TO PREVENT FUTURE DANGER FOR OTHERS. I ALSO THINK IT'S BS THAT I'VE HAD TO PAY A MONTH'S RENT FOR A PART THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE FAILED AT ONLY 54,000 MILES. I WILL NOT BE KEEPING THIS CAR AND PAYING ANOTHER MONTH'S RENT IN A YEAR. I WILL ALSO NOT BE DOING BUSINESS WITH ANY GM MANUFACTURER.",

THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN CHEVROLET DEALER FOR REPAIRS. AFTER THE SALE OF THE VEHICLE, THE BRAKE FAILURE RECURRED AND THE CONTACT RETURNED TO THE DEALER. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A CHEVROLET DEALER FOR REPAIRS SINCE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY. BEFORE THE CONTACT COULD TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A DEALER, SHE WAS INVOLVED IN A CRASH. WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN IN THE RAIN, THE VEHICLE SHUT OFF AND SLID INTO THE SIDE OF A CURB.  THE AXLES, ROTOR, SPINDLE, AND RIMS WERE FRACTURED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S HOME. A POLICE REPORT WAS NOT FILED AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN DEALER TO BE DIAGNOSED AND THEY STATED THERE WERE NO RECALLS. THE CONTACT WAS REFERRED TO GENERAL MOTORS. THE CONTACT BOUGHT NEW ROTORS, A NEW SPINDLE, AND RIMS AND HAD THEM  REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. GENERAL MOTORS REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE THE FAILURE BECAUSE REPAIRS HAD BEEN MADE; HOWEVER, THE BRAKES CONTINUED TO MALFUNCTION. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 36,000.",

WHEN HE RAN THE CODES, HIS COMPUTER SHOWED TWO SENSORS AND THE ALTERNATOR NEEDED REPLACING. OVER $700.00 LATER, THE PROBLEM STILL WASN'T FIXED. I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, FEARING THE LACK OF POWER AND BOGGING WOULD CAUSE ME TO STALL IN TRAFFIC, THUS INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. IT IS BURNING GAS AND BOGGING UPON ACCELERATION AND / OR WHILE IDLING. SOMETIMES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO START. THE DIAGNOSTIC LIGHT IS STILL ON. TODAY, MY MECHANIC IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM. THE CHECK VALVE IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD HAS STOPPED SEALING AND HAS DISAPPEARED. WHERE DID IT GO? INSIDE THE ENGINE? I ASK. IT WILL NEED A NEW VENT TUBE, A NEW INTAKE MANIFOLD WITH THE CHECK VALVE INTACT, AND A NEW VALVE COVER WHICH HAS TO BE REPLACED DUE TO A LITTLE DIAPHRAGM WHICH CAN'T BE REPLACED BY ITSELF. ANOTHER POOR DESIGN. THIS CAR ONLY HAS 47,967 MILES AS OF 2-05-2019. I BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR THE GOOD GAS MILEAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED AT THIS TIME. GM NEEDS TO CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY A FAULTY DESIGN OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD.

TODAY 7/1/2018, I DROVE DOWN TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE ENGINE LIGHT HAS NOT COME ON, BUT NOW THE CAR DOES NOT WANT TO START AND SOUNDS LIKE THE STARTER OR THE BATTERY IS DYING. THIS IS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MOST FRUSTRATING CAR PROBLEM I HAVE EVERY HAD, AND I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND ANYONE CAPABLE OF ANSWERING THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR. THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS SPRING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WHILE DRIVING IN TOWN, AND IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY FOR A FEW DAYS IF YOU MESS WITH THE BATTERY CABLES, BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPLACED ONCE AND THE PROBLEM IS BACK!!!",

I SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WILL MARK MY 2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY HAVING THIS VEHICLE IN JULY 2017.I AM VERY DISPLEASED RIGHT NOW AND WOULD LIKE THIS ISSUE TO BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT SOMEONE FROM THIS GOVERNMENT AGENCY CONTACT THE DEALER LOCATED IN NORTH PALM BEACH SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS WRONG WITH MY CAR. SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD HAPPEN TO CARS THAT ARE 5 YEARS OLD NOT 1 1/2 YEARS OLD.  *TR",

THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE DEALER FOR 2 MONTHS AND I AM MAKING PAYMENTS ON A VEHICLE THAT WE CANNOT EVEN USE. I KNOW IT IS NOT THE DEALERS FAULT , IT IS THE GMC MANUFACTURING COMPANY.  I KNOW SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS.  THIS IS A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY. HOW CAN ONE OF THE BIGGEST CAR COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE? AFTER ALL THE BAILOUT MONEY THAT WAS GIVING TO THEM OUT OF OUR TAX DOLLARS.  I DO NOT EVEN FEEL SAFE FOR MY SON TO DRIVE THAT CAR ANY MORE EVEN IF THEY REPLACE THE PARTS.  I WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO GET A SECOND OR THIRD OPINION. WHAT AM I MY SUPPOSED TO DO TRADE IN THE CAR FOR WHAT?  FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE THAT HAS MORE RECALLS. IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THE GMC VEHICLES HAVE RECALLS.  WE PURCHASED THE CRUZE BECAUSE IT WAS ECONOMICAL ON GAS AND LOOK I HAVE A FRUSTRATED TEEN THAT IS STARTING COLLEGE IN LESS THAT A MONTH AND CANNOT DRIVE HIS BRAND NEW CAR.  I KEEP GETTING MESSAGES ABOUT OTHER RECALLS, THE RECENT ONE WAS THE DEFECTIVE AIR BAGS.  PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO TO FEEL BETTER. I CALLED GMC ASKED TO TALK TO A SUPERVISOR AND WAITED AND WAITED AND THEY WASTED MY TIME BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR A MOTHER COMPLAINING ABOUT HER CHILD'S SAFETY.  IF EVERYONE WOULD DO THEIR JOB CORRECTLY, NO ONE WOULD BE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS.  I REALLY HOPE SOMEONE IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL OF THIS.  HOW CAN THEY REPLACE THE PARTS WITH USED PARTS? I REALLY HOPE THAT ALL OF US BEING AFFECTED BY THESE GET SOME  INCENTIVE TO KEEP OUR CARS AND TO HELP US TO EASE OUR FRUSTRATION.  I AM REALLY  CONCERNED ABOUT MY SON'S SAFETY.  HELP!!!

HOWEVER, THE DATA IN THE REPORT DOES NOT SUPPORT GMCS CONTENTION.  ONE MAJOR ERROR DISCOVERED ON THE REPORT WAS THAT THE SENSOR SAID IT WAS A SMALL ADULT SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THAT ADULT WEIGHED 265 POUNDS OR MORE AT THAT TIME.   NEXT ONE OF THE DATA RECORDS SAYS THE EVENT TOOK PLACE ON 7/5/2013.  ONE OF THE EVENT RECORDERS STATES THE CAR WAS ROLLING IN A CLOCKWISE FLASHING BUT ANOTHER ONE SHOWS THE CAR WAS ROLLING HEAD TO TOE.  FINALLY, THE GRAPHICAL DATA SHOWS NO ROLLOVER IN ONE SENSOR AND A COUNTERCLOCKWISE ROTATION IN THE OTHER.  GMC STATED THAT THEY WOULD FIX THE CAR FOR FREE AND OFFERED TO PAY MEDICAL FEES AND BILLS.  THE PASSENGER SUFFERED A BROKEN COLLAR BONE, A RUPTURED EAR DRUM AND BLOOD PRESSURE ON SITE OF 220/140.  THE VEHICLE SENSOR STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS HIT ON THE SIDE (BROADSIDED).  THE DATA RECORDER STATES THAT BOTH AIRBAGS WENT OFF AT THE SAME TIME, BUT THERE WAS A THREE SECOND DELAY BETWEEN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG, THEN THE DRIVER AIRBAG.  THE PASSENGER AIRBAG INDICATOR STATUS WAS SET TO THE OFF POSITION, THUS NO PASSENGER AIRBAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED PER MANUFACTURER SPECS.  NO REAR CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.

IF A VEHICLE WITH A FRACTURED HALF SHAFT IS PARKED WITHOUT THE PARKING BRAKE APPLIED, THE CAR COULD MOVE UNEXPECTEDLY. EITHER CONDITION INCREASES THE RISK OF A CRASH.    EVER SINCE I BOUGHT IT I KEPT HEARING STRANGE NOISE UNDER MY CAR. NOT JUST THAT THE CAR ALSO HAD SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ELECTRICAL, THE SCREEN KEPT  GOING BLACK. I CALLED THE AGENCY AND THEY KEPT MY CAR FOR A WEEK. THEY KEPT SAYING THAT THEY HAD TROUBLE KNOWING WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON WITH MY CAR. AT THE END THEY JUST SAY THAT IT WAS DUE TO AN UPDATE.
