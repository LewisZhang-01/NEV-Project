I was finally able to get the car just off the road and called for roadside assist.  Once the car was left at my house I examined the right front wheel which was cockeyed to discover the lower control arm steel body had disintegrated (see photos).  Looking online I discovered there had been a  recall on these arms 9 years ago.  I sent a message to Subaru Customer Care and received no reply.  I sent a tweet on twitter to Subaru of America and received no reply.  I finally called their 800 number and was told the recall had been completed on this vehicle in 2012 by putting some \"rust-proofing\" on the arms.  They did not go through the effort to replace with the upgraded replacement part. SOA said they would not cover any repair or replacement of the lower control arms. There have to be 10s of thousands of these vehicles on the roads with arms rotting from the inside out because SOA did the recall on the cheap.  The bushings and balljoint was still intact and no clunking or judder prior to the catastrophic failure.  Is it going to take a death(s) to get this corrected.  SOA know they should have replaced these arms and will sell you the upgraded one for around $300.  No aftermarket companies are making these arms as far as I can find.  Subaru admits on their own parts site the arms \"do not often fail\" i.e the body and instead the bushings wear out.  The body of the car has very minimal rust and no signs the arm(s) would have deteriorated. I have asked SOA to replace the arms with ones that are structurally sound but think a second recall on cars that didn't get new arms may be required.",

SUBARU PARTS PERSONAL SAID THE ROLL OVER VALVE ON THE TOP OF THE GAS TANK WAS USUALLY THE PROBLEM MOST OF THE TIME.  IF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN, WILL PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE.  SO IN JUNE AFTER COMING OFF THE HIGHWAY, THE CHECK ENGINE COMES ON.  TOOK CAR TO SUBARU AND SAID COULD NOT BE CERTAIN IT WAS ROLL OVER VALVE, HOWEVER SUGGESTED TO REPLACE.

BELOW IS A POSTING FROM MECHANIC NOTIFYING FORUMS, FACEBOOK, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO WILL LISTEN OF THE ISSUE (THERE ARE GOOD MECHANICS OUT THERE).     ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT, GETTING CALLS ON, AND PERSONALLY SEEING FOR OURSELVES IS THESE AIR INJECTION SOLENOIDS HAVING ISSUES ON THE 06+ MODEL VEHICLES. REMEMBER THE AIR PUMP IS SUPPOSE TO ONLY RUN FOR A SHORT MOMENT UNDER START UP (IT INJECTS OXYGEN INTO THE EXHAUST TO BURN OFF THE EXCESS FUELING AT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS SO THEY WILL LITE OFF).    HERE YOU CAN SEE BOTH OF THESE BAD SOLENOIDS AND HOW GUMMED UP THEY'RE GETTING FROM EXHAUST GASES AND MOISTURE. THE CHECK VALVE GETS DAMAGED FORCING IT TO BE STUCK OPEN, WHICH CAUSES CONSTANT HOT EXHAUST GASES TO RUN THROUGH THESE PARTS, YOU CAN SEE THE SEAL ON THE PLUNGER IS LITERALLY DESTROYED FROM THE HEAT.

WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS THE MATS STARTED TO SLIDE AROUND THE FLOOR AND HAVE BUNCHED-UP UNDER THE PEDAL CLUSTER. I AM CAREFUL TO REPOSITION THEM.     WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE HUNDREDS OF RUBBER TABS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE 4 MATS STARTED TO FALL OFF. THIS IS ON ALL FOUR MATS. SUBARU TOLD ME THIS WAS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY.     I READ ABOUT A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TOYOTA HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SUBARU. PERHAPS THEY USE THE SAME VENDOR TO SUPPLY FLOOR MATES IN THE USA.    I KNOW THIS IS DANGEROUS. MY CAR IS STILL UNDER THE NEW CAR WARRANTY, SO I AM NOT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. MY BET IS OTHERS HAVE THIS PROBLEM TOO.    LIKE I SAID IT AFFECTS ALL FOUR MATS, AND MY BACK SEATS ARE RARELY USED, SO IT MUST BE THE MATS.    MY CAR HAS 22,000 MILES.    THANK YOU *TR",
