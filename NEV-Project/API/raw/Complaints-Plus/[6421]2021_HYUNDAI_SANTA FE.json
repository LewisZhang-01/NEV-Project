From July 2021 it took till Jan 2022 to get a replacement. Had to pay the $500 deductible. However this should not happen on a brand new 2021 Santa Fe that was just manufactured in May/June 2021.

I emailed Hyundai consumer complaints on August 17, 2021 and on August 18 received an email stating I had a case # and would be contacted shortly.

        "summary": "This vehicle is the first Santa Fe that only comes with adaptive cruise control and there is no way to disable it and set regular cruise control.  Here are just a few examples of the safety risk. We were on State Highway 29 which is a rural 4 lane highway. There were 4 cars near us. Our cruise was set for 70mph. A vehicle came in front of us to pass which it did. There was no issue. However, our vehicle saw this as a threat and our vehicle slowed from 70mph to 50mph until the other vehicle was out of the set car length distance. Meanwhile the other cars around us had no indication or warning why we would have slowed down this much and we were nearly rear ended. There was screeching of tires and brakes suddenly applied by the other vehicles. All for nothing. I am on the highway with the cruise set at 75mph when again vehicles will come in front of me and my vehicle slows from 75 mph to 54mph, causing the surrounding vehicles to not know what is going on and I hope they are paying attention because there is nothing really going on other than normal driving. It is terrifying to have your vehicle control itself and you don\u2019t know when it will start to accelerate again so for the most part, I am shutting the cruise control off and on constantly. At our most recent Hyundai service appointment for this problem, we were told by Hyundai Care Manager that this is exactly how it\u2019s designed and there is no problem.  And we\u2019ve been told just simply don\u2019t use the cruise control at all. That is not a solution.  We feel like all these \u201csafety\u201d features are creating a sense of driver coma on our roads.  Instead of the left lane being used for faster cars as a passing lane, the adaptive cruises are creating a chain of vehicles that are well under the speed limit",

The Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist did not function properly to stop my car to avoid a low speed impact. I applied the brakes to stop. I could not avoid impacting another vehicle. The damage was minor. Hyundai did inspect my vehicle braking system on June 8 at Hyundai of Cool Springs. I was not provided full report on findings/corrective action. Hyundai America was supposed to provide a follow up report. I was called today and the Hyundai representative had no details on the brake inspection to share with me. I am suspicious. I think Hyundai is hiding a safety issue.  I am reporting this event so the NTSB can contact Hyundai to determine if this is a safety defect needing corrective action.

No turn signal indicators on the tail light assemblies located just below the rear window of the SUV as found on EVERY OTHER recently built SUV currently driving on US highways.  That includes the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe which we traded in to purchase this model. While I like this vehicle very much, I'm concerned for the safety of my family and anyone else who purchases a 2021 Santa Fe.
