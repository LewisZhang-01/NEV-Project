THIS SITUATION HAS OCCURRED 3 TIMES AND MAY HAVE LEAD TO AT LEAST ONE FENDER BENDER WHERE THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION WAS HIT FROM BEHIND BECAUSE FOLLOWING CAR THOUGHT THAT MY CAR WAS ACCELERATING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. AFTER STALLING, ALL 3 CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS MAY OR MAY NOT STAY ON. AFTER PUTTING CAR IN NEUTRAL AND RESTARTING ENGINE, CAR ACCELERATES ON RUNS NORMALLY UNTIL NEXT STALLING EVENT. SINCE JANUARY 2010,  I HAVE BEEN TO THE TOYOTA DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT 4 TIMES. I HAVE HAD 2 GAS CAPS REPLACED, OXYGEN METER REPLACE, BREAK/ACCELERATOR PEDAL CHECKED, CHARCOAL CANISTER REPLACED, NEW BATTERY, AND SEVERAL OIL CHANGES. THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS. THIS UPCOMING WEEKEND THEY SAID THEY WILL CHANGE THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY. *TR",

ON EACH OCCASION I WAS ON A RIGHT HAND CURVE IN THE ROAD AND WAS ACCELERATING THROUGH THE TURN AFTER INITIALLY SLOWING DOWN TO BEGIN THE CURVE.  ON EACH OCCASION I WAS OBEYING THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT FOR THE SECTION OF THE ROAD WHERE THE CURVE WAS LOCATED.  AS I BEGAN ACCELERATING INTO THE CURVE THE STEERING WHEEL SUDDENLY JERKED TO THE RIGHT, A BEEPING NOISE OCCURRED AND THE VEHICLE MOMENTARILY FELT LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP.  A MOMENT LATER THE BEEPING STOPPED AND STEERING CONTROL RETURNED.  IN EACH SITUATION I WAS ABLE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.  IN TWO OF THE THREE OCCURRENCES I HAD A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE WITH ME.      TODAY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE.  I ADVISED THEM THAT I HAD SEEN A RECALL CONCERNING THE TOYOTA AVALON WHICH SEEMED TO BE IDENTICAL TO THE SITUATION I HAD ENCOUNTERED.  I INFORMED THEM THAT THE INCIDENTS HAD ALL BEEN ON RIGHT HAND CURVES AND THAT THE OCCURRENCES HAD HAPPENED AT SPREAD OUT INTERVALS OVER THE LAST YEAR.  I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THEY DID NOT EXAMINE THE STEERING SYSTEM BUT HAD TAKEN THE VEHICLE OUT FOR TEST DRIVES IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXPERIENCE THE ISSUE.    I CALLED THE TOYOTA CORPORATE OFFICES AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THEM AND ADVISED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP IN SAN DIEGO.

I TOOK IT TO MY HUSBAND'S MECHANIC TO REPAIR/PATCH IT IF POSSIBLE. HE SAID HE HAS SEEN MANY VEHICLES WITH MORE MILES THAN MINE IN MUCH WORSE CONDITION THAT HAVE NO RUSTED OUT REAR DIFFERENTIALS.

AFTER TALKING TO MANY PEOPLE AND VISITING THE WWW.4RUNNERFORUM.COM WEB SITE IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM IN 4RUNNERS YEARS 1999 TO 2002. I WOULD IMAGINE MORE PEOPLE HAVE THE PROBLEM THAN HAVE REPORTED IT TO THE WEBSITE.

OTHER THAN THIS PROBLEM, MY 4 RUNNER HAS BEEN A GREAT VEHICLE.    TOYOTA HAS A HISTORY OF GREAT VEHICLES. I KNOW THEY RECALLED THE TACOMA TRUCKS FROM THE LATE ' 90'S FOR FRAME RUSTOUT AND GAVE THE OWNERS 2 X THE TRADE IN VALUE TOWARDS A NEW TOYOTA. BECAUSE OF THIS RECALL, I KNOW TOYOTA IS WILLING TO STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES.     TOYOTA OFFERING A REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE PART OR \"TRADE IN VALUE\" TOWARDS A NEW TOYOTA WOULD BE A GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS KEEPING LOYAL CUSTOMERS.
