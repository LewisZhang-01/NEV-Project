        "summary": "THE MISALIGNMENT OF THE TWO AXLES HAS BECOME VERY NOTICEABLE.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HUBS OF THE TIRE/RIM IS 2\" DIFFERENT BETWEEN LEFT PAIR AND RIGHT PAIR OF WHEELS.  THIS TRANSLATES INTO VERY DIFFERENT ANGLE OF ROLLING DIRECTION, NEITHER BEING ALIGNED WITH THE TRAILER FRAME.  THE FRONT AXLE STEERS LEFT, THE RIGHT AXLE STEERS RIGHT.  THE CAUSE IS THE SPRING MOUNTS ARE  WELDED TO DIFFERENT PLACES (DIMENSIONALLY) ON THE FRAME.  THE RESULT IS DUMP TRAILER THAT DOES NOT TRAIL PROPERLY, WEARS OUT TIRES IN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILES AND SINCE THE SPRINGS ARE LOADED AND ACTIVATED DIFFERENTLY ON EACH SIDE THE LOAD IS POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE.  IT IS BEYOND ME HOW A MANUFACTURER CAN BE ALLOWED TO MANUFACTURE A PRODUCT FOR SALE TO CONSUMERS AND USED ON PUBLIC ROADS WITH THIS DEGREE OF SLOPPY ASSEMBLY.  *TR",
