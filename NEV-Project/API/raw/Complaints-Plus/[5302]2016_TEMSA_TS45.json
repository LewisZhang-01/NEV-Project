SINCE THIS IS A PASSENGER BUS THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR EVERYONE ON THE BUS AS WELL AS ANYONE ON THE ROAD WITH THE BUS. UPON DIAGNOSING THE VIBRATION WITH HELP OF A CHASSIS MOUNTED CAMERA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE STEERING GEAR BOX WAS OSCILLATING ONCE AN INPUT WAS PLACED THROUGH THE SUSPENSION AFTER ABOUT 40 MPH AND THROUGH 55 MPH. THIS OCCURRENCE WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE MANUFACTURER AND ITS DISTRIBUTERS, BUT THEIR ENGINEERS DETERMINED IT STILL MET THEIR SPECIFICATIONS. ONCE IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM, THE CUSTOMER REQUESTED THAT WE TRY TO REMEDY THE VIBRATION.",
