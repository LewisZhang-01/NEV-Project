My 25 year old daughter was coming up to a busy intersection that usually has semi-trucks and when she went to break the breaks failed and the pedal went to the floor. I found out that there was a recall on the Nissan Pathfinder emergency breaking system and asked Nissan as was directed on their website to immediatly tow the car to the nearest Nissan dealership to get repaired. They refused! I was on the phone with them for 5 hours telling them that they had to come get their car the ABS light had been on and the car was a risk to our family, home and community as we lived on a main street. They refused. My husband got the car to Nissan. I have since have talked to Nissan and Nissan dealership for over 12 hours. This car also has a major transmission defect that Nissan dealership denies. They said the car is find even though I told them that my husband and I both notice the car slipping. We have 10 children, 8 that still living with us including 2 disabled children. We have asked Nissan to buy back this recalled, defective car and I was told to come pick it up at the dealership tomorrow and turn back in the rental car that they fixed it as much as they would. They did nothing to the transmission, and the Transmission has extended warranty. They know it has a defective part on it and have refused to fix it and said it was fine, even though they know the car could just shut down and shake violently when I am on the way to take my daughter to Boston from Ohio for her healthcare conditions. Upon getting my car to the shop the dealership stated the Calibers were bad, the rotors were bad, the front break pads were pad, and this was all on top of the recall on this car. Nissan needs to buy back there defective car immediately and Hertz should never have sold us this car with these know defects. Nissan informed us that Hertz car sales knew about the defects before selling us this car.  Please Help us with inspection!",
