HE WAS FORCED TO STAND ON A MOVING BUS FOR A TWO HOUR DRIVE THROUGH SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AT 65 MILES AN HOUR.  I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE PARTICULARS OF THE VEHICLE OR IF YOU ARE EVEN WHO I NEED TO COMPLAIN TO BUT HE WAS LUCKY AND DID NOT SUSTAIN AN INJURY BUT THE NEXT KID THEY DO THIS TO MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY.  THIS PRACTICE OF SMASHING AS MANY PEOPLE ONTO A BUS AS POSSIBLE FOR ADDED PROFIT HAS TO STOP!  I ENTERED ANY RANDOM INFORMATION ON THE NEXT PAGES JUST SO THIS CAN BE SENT TO YOU SINCE I AM A CONSUME AND NOT OWNER OF SAID BUS LINE. *TR",
