        "summary": "2020 VIEW IS ALL NEW DESIGN INCLUDING THE COACH DOOR WHICH IS THE MAJOR EXIT FOR NORMAL USE AS WELL AS EMERGENCIES. THE DOOR'S LOCKING MECHANISM FAILS IF AN ATTEMPTS IS MADE TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE AT THE SAME TIME. THIS RESULTS IN THE DOOR NOT LOCKING OR STAYING CLOSED. THIS HAPPENED TO US ON A TRIP RECENTLY AND WE WERE 350 MILES FROM HOME. WE HAD TO LITERALLY TIE THE DOOR DOWN WITH RATCHETING STRAPS TO KEEP IT FROM FLYING OPEN ON THE HIGHWAY. THE PASSENGER SEATS WITH SEATBELTS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR IN QUESTION PUTTING PEOPLE AT HIGH RISK OF INJURY SHOULD THE DOOR SUDDENLY FLY OPEN.    I DO NOT RECALL THE SPECIFIC DATE SO THE DATE BELOW IS AN APPROXIMATION.     I WROTE TO WINNEBAGO ABOUT THIS AND THEIR RESPONSE SO FAR HAS BEEN THAT THEY WILL LOOK INTO WHETHER \"ANYTHING CAN BE ALTERED\". I HOPE THIS CAN BE LOOKED INTO SINCE THERE ARE PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF UNITS OUT THERE WITH THE OWNERS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE RISK POSED BY A COMPLETELY FAULTY DESIGN. WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE STRAPS HANDY BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO SECURE THE DOOR WHILE CAMPING IN REMOTE AREAS.    I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT TYING THE DOOR DOWN WITH STRAPS ALSO ESSENTIALLY DISABLES THE ONLY MAJOR EXIT (EMERGENCY AND NORMAL) FROM THE COACH.*DT*JB",
