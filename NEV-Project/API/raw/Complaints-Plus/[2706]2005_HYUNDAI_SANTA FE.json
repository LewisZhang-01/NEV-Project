THE CAR IS 10 YEARS OLD AND I DO LIVE IN A SALT BELT STATE, BUT I SEE THAT THERE WERE RECALLS FOR THE 2003 HYUNDAI SANTA FE FOR SIMILAR FRAME RUST ISSUES, SO I NOW RECOMMEND THAT THE RECALL INVESTIGATION BE EXTENDED TO THE 2005 MODELS AS WELL.

I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED, HAD WAITED JUST ONE MORE MONTH BEFORE HAVING THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE CAR REVIEWED BY A PROFESSIONAL?  I SHUDDER TO THINK OF IT!!   AT ANY RATE, THIS WILL BE MY LAST HYUNDAI PURCHASE SINCE THEY CLEARLY HAVE NOT MET MY OWN PERSONAL STANDARDS FOR SAFETY.

THE ISSUE IS THAT OUR CAR FAILS TO START AT VARIOUS TIME OR HAS ENGINE FAILURE WHILE DRIVING. WE PURCHASE THIS CAR FROM AN ELDERLY FRIEND WHO HAD THE CAR IN THE REPAIR SHOP FOR THE SAME REASON WE ARE WRITING THIS LETTER. SHE WAS TOLD AFTER ALL ATTEMPTS AT REPAIRS THAT THE CAR WAS NOT REPAIRABLE AND THIS WAS JUST A CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS MAKE AND MODEL. THE RESPONSE WE RECEIVED FROM HYUNDAI WAS THAT IT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THE CAR FROM A FRIEND AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRS LIES WITH US AT OUR EXPENSE. WE FEEL THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT OUR PURCHASE BUT THE HEARTLESS NEGLIGENCE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A 80+ YEAR OLD LADY, WHO HAD NO ONE TO BACK HER UP. I FEEL THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLES STEERING AND OR BRAKES AND ACCELERATION WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SAFETY. THE ENGINE HAS FAILED TO START AND STOPPED AT VARIOUS TIME AND SITUATIONS. PLEASE INFORM US IF THERE IS ANY RECOURSE FOR US AND OUR SITUATION.                 PS THIS CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND WAS NEVER REPAIRED BY THE DEALERSHIP.

I MANAGED TO DRIVE IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP A MILE AWAY WHERE THEY REALIZED THAT THE BRAKE FLUID WAS EMPTY DUE TO A RUPTURED SEAL IN THE BRAKE CALIBER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THEY FOUND THAT BOTH FRONT SUSPENSION COIL SPRINGS WERE DAMAGED.  THE PASSENGER SIDE COIL HAD LITERALLY SNAPPED IN HALF AND THE DRIVER'S SIDE COIL WAS DISLOCATED AND BROKEN.  MY CAR HAD JUST BEEN IN THE SAME DEALERSHIP ONE WEEK PRIOR HAVING A NEW TRANSMISSION INSTALLED IN IT (UNDER WARRANTY).  AS NO LOUD BANG OR NOISE OCCURRED AS WITH THE MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN TO THEM, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THE COILS BROKE OR SHIFTED DURING THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT WHEN THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR WAS ON THE LIFT, AND NOT ON THE SUSPENSION. THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE THAT NEITHER OF THESE COILS WERE FOUND BROKEN AT THAT TIME HAS ME INCENSED.  THE FACT THAT A SOLID STEEL COIL THAT TAKES 4,000LBS TO COMPRESS CAN BREAK IN HALF LIKE THAT IS DISTURBING.  I ASSUME THAT WITHOUT THE SUSPENSION, DUE TO THE BROKEN COILS, THE BRAKES SUFFERED DAMAGE AND THE ABOVE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

AS I NOW FOUND OUT, THIS OPTIONAL 3.5 ENGINE IS EQUIPPED WITH A COMPUTER OPERATED ACCELERATION THROTTLE ENGINE. THIS NEW SET UP IS VERY POORLY DESIGNED, HAS A FEW SECOND DELAY AND THEN THE CAR DARTS OFF FAST, SOMETIMES SPINNING ALL DRIVE WHEELS ON DRY PAVEMENT. I BOUGHT A 4 WHEEL DRIVE UNIT FOR OUR RAIN, SNOW COVERED ROADS IN OREGON, HOWEVER IT'S MUCH WORST ON THIS TYPE OF CONDITIONS. I'VE ALMOST REAR ENDED THE CAR AHEAD OF ME SEVERAL TIMES AND ALSO HAVE TO HAVE ONE FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL IN HEAVY TRAFFIC OR WHERE I HAVE TO STOP FOR PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREET. THIS I KNOW IS A VERY DANGEROUS WITH PEDESTRIANS AND HEAVY STOP AND GO TRAFFIC IN EVERY DAY SITUATIONS. I'VE QUIT DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AS I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOST OF LIFE, SINCE I'VE HAD A STROKE AND SLOWER NOW. I CALLED MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER AND THEY SUGGESTED I HAVE IT TOW 55 MILES TO THEM, WHICH I DID. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS THERE, THEY SAID THEY RE PROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER AND IT WAS SOMEWHAT BETTER. I PICKED IT UP AND WITHIN A FEW CITY BLOCKS I NEW IT WAS JUST THE SAME AS BEFORE. I WAS PLANNING A TRIP TO LAS VEGAS, NV. AND DECIDED I WOULD TAKE IT THERE AND THEN TO A DEALER IN THAT TOWN, WHICH I DID. WHAT A SURPRISE, THAT DEALERSHIP WAS VERY WELL A WHERE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAD HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE EXACT PROBLEM. THE SERVICE MANAGER AND MECHANIC CAME OUT TO TELL ME THAT THERE WAS A REAL PROBLEM WITH THE 3.5 ENGINE AND THAT THERE WAS NO FIX FOR IT AT THAT TIME, MY BEST CURE WOULD BE TO TRADE IT IN FOR A ANOTHER CAR !!. THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TRY TO FIX IT. I PAID 25,000.00 DOLLARS FOR IT AND CAN'T EVEN KNOW DRIVE IT SAFELY.  *JB",
