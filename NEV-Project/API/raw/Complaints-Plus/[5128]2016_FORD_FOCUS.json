The contact stated that while his wife was accelerating from a complete stop, the vehicle stalled inadvertently in the middle of an intersection.

The contact became aware that the VIN was included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V735000 (Fuel System, Gasoline). The dealer was notified of the failure and advised the contact that he would need to pay for the diagnosis of the vehicle before they could complete the recall repair. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that the recall repair was completed in July 2019; however, VIN tool and manufacturer website showed the recall incomplete. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 86,000.",

Then a warning light came on stating that the transmission was overheated and to pull over as soon as possible. At this point I am stuck in the middle of traffic and the accelerator would not respond because the transmission seems to be stuck in neutral not in gear so I could not control the speed of the car. I was able to coast over to the side of the road. I had to wait for about 15 minutes for the transmission to cool down and tried again. The same thing occurred about 15 minutes later. I was able to get off the road to a mechanic. The mechanic stated that the transmission was bad and needed to be replaced. This transmission only has 22,150 miles on it, the car was not driven that much. There is no way a transmission should go bad with such low miles. This seems to be a widespread issue from what I see online several other people with the same issue. Ford does not want to admit they have faulty equipment but the transmission problem is a safety issue. I almost lost control of the car. Thanks.",

        "summary": "The upper management of Ford at the time should be ashamed of themselves for seriously damaging the reliability reputation of the Ford Focus between the model years of particularly 2012 to 2016 by introducing into the setup a dry dual clutch transmission that they did not already have a quality backup plan to just in case the complaints started piling up about the supposed manual feel of the transmission.  The drive-ability of the 2016 Ford Focus SE HB I make payments on is at best a D level experience. I, too, am plagued by the regular occurrence of the shuddering between the 1st and 2nd gear along with the spiking RPMs that follow immediately after when the shuddering transpires. It seems almost as if the 2nd gear is coming in on the 1st a little too soon, which would factor in an obvious failed effort on transmission calibration. In general, the shifting performance is unnerving and quite embarrassing when you have passengers.  If you are like me and have one of these vehicles with this transmission type, good luck on getting a true fix in this Power-Shift setup. It is possible to improve the driving conditions with third party tuning if your strategy will pair with the tuning device (another issue of discussion for Ford); otherwise, one needs a complete, conventional transmission installed in hopes of getting rid of this issue in its entirety if an automatic transmission is your preferred preference.  In summary, the Ford Focus SE I have is the 2.0. liter, and it appears that Ford has discreetly excluded this liter from the recall, warranty work in general. In other words, you will likely have an incredible hard time getting a Ford dealership to acknowledge the problem or replace your clutches unless you pay for it. To fully remedy this situation, Ford should be required to buyback all of these poorly calibrated transmission cars from current owners and those still for sale on the American market.",

This would lead to rapid declaration, often times in moderate or greater traffic causing hazardous conditions to both myself and passengers and/or other vehicles and their passengers.  The hazard was of possible collision as the vehicle did not perform at the speed of traffic.  Additional hazard and safety issue, was during these events, the vehicle would enter a \"neutral\" gear position and although the accelerator was depressed, their was NO torque to the drive train, this would also either decelerate the vehicle rapidly or in the event of cornering, increase the speed instantly during the cornering turn (because of the lack of downshift torque to the drive train)...on one instance I was unable to control the turn speed quickly enough and the vehicle entered the shoulder of the turn before I was able to regain positive control of the vehicle.   Although Ford has a Customer Satisfaction Program (CSP) extending the warranties for the transmission clutch and TCM, it appears that Ford Service Dealers are extremely hesitant to perform the warranty service.  To that end, I have taken my vehicle to local Ford dealer with the transmission shudder conditions complaint, and each time they claim their diagnostics were not able to replicate my issue.  All these service appts were while vehicle was under the warranty in miles and months. Then, this last week the vehicle had the same instances happen while on the freeway (all previous episodes had been on surface city streets), and it was a very dangerous situation with at least 2 vehicles taking evasive action to avoid rear-ending my vehicle as it decelerated rapidly.  I pulled over and vehicle was towed to Ford service, where they say the clutch is worn, as is the TCM.",

I ASSUMED ITS BECAUSE OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION THAT THE WHEELS ARE SLIPPING. BUT AFTER READING THE NEWS ABOUT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS IN OTHER FORD FOCUS, I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS TRANSMISSION RELATED. I CONSULTED A MECHANIC ON THIS AND THE ASSOCIATED FORD DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE THERE WAS A WARRANTY EXTENSIONS FOR VEHICLES BUILT TILL NOV 5TH OF 2015. MY VEHICLE WAS BUILT ON DEC 21ST OF 2015. I ALREADY DROVE THE VEHICLE FOR 85000 MILES. I DONOT WANT TO BE BURDENED WITH EXPENSIVE REPAIRS ONCE FORD DECIDES LATER TO EXTENT THE WARRANTY TO 100000  MILE AND I DONOT QUALIFY.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME ENGAGEMENT MECHANISM OR PROGRAM FREQUENTLY MISJUDGES THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE CLUTCH, RESULTING IN MECHANICAL ABNORMALITY RANGING FROM A FLUTTER TO A SHUDDER TO A LOUD AND FORCEFUL KNOCKING AS IT ATTEMPTS TO ENGAGE.

I DO HOWEVER FEEL THIS CAR IS SUCH A SAFETY HAZARD TO PEOPLE, I HAVE A \"DONT BUY A FOCUS\" STICKER GOING DOWN BOTH SIDES OF MY CARS WINDOWS. I'M STUCK WITH THIS CAR BECAUSE OF CREDIT ISSUES SO I'M GOING TO LET EVERYONE KNOW MY STORY IF I CAN SAVE THEM HAVING PROBLEMS NOT EVEN A YEAR AFTER BUYING THIS BRAND NEW FOCUS. ALL FORD HAD TO SAY IS IT'S A CLUTCH PROBLEM IF COMPLETELY SAFE. THAT'S EVEN WHEN I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE IT TILL THEY DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'M NOT ON TRANSMISSION CLUTCH SET #5 I'VE DEALT WITH SO MUCH LOST TIME BECAUSE OF THIS MATTER AND FORD SHOULD BE HELD COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE. START DATE FOR THE PROBLEMS IS THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR.
