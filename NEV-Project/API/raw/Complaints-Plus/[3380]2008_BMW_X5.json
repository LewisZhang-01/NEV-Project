WE WERE AT THE FRONT OF A LONG LINE OF FOLKS HEADING THROUGH CUSTOMS INTO CANADA. YES, AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE. IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING!    AFTER FUSSING FOR ANOTHER 30 MINUTES TRYING TO GET IT INTO NEUTRAL, SEVERAL ABLE BODIED CANADIAN CUSTOMS OFFICERS PUSHED IT INTO THEIR COUNTRY. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER CAME ANOTHER 40 MINUTES LATER AND TOOK US TO A BMW SERVICE SHOP IN MONTREAL.     SIRS, WHAT'S SO HARD TO SWALLOW ABOUT THIS BREAKDOWN IS THAT WE COMPLETED THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE SERVICE ON THE CAR JUST 7 DAYS BEFORE AT NEW COUNTRY BMW IN HARTFORD, CT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A NEGLIGIBLE OIL LEAK THAT THEY SAID WAS NO PROBLEM, I WAS ASSURED THAT MY CAR WAS FINE. BUT, IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WAS NOT; AND LIKE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF BMWS, THE FUEL PUMP FAILED.    WHAT'S MORE, IT IS CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT, BACK IN 2014, THE CAR WAS FAILING TO START AND WOULD CUT OFF WHILE DRIVING AROUND MY TOWN (I WAS TOO AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON THE HIGHWAY AT THAT TIME). ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICING AND EVENTUALLY IT WAS 'FIXED (THOUGH THE FUEL PUMP WAS NEVER REPLACED UNTIL THIS LAST FAILURE). AND SO, I SUSPECT THAT I HAVE PAID FOR A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AT LEAST THREE TIMES AND I'M SICK OF IT.

ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS IMMACULATE AND LOOKED BRAND NEW, IT NEEDED A NEW RIGHT REAR AIR SUSPENSION BAG 3 MONTHS AFTER THE PURCHASE AND STARTED LEAKING OIL.  SINCE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE IN 2012 I HAVE CONTINUED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP AT WHICH TIME THEY CLEAN THE OIL UNDERNEATH, REMOVE GASKETS AND BOLTS AND REASSEMBLE EVERYTHING TO INCLUDE USING GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF SILICONE.  I RECENTLY TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE OWNER DID HIS USUAL \"PATCH JOB\" BUT HE SAID THIS ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE AND THAT THE OIL LEAK IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM A FAILED GASKET THAT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITHOUT REMOVING THE MOTOR TO THE TUNE OF $6,000 OR MORE.  THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP FURTHER MENTIONED THAT THE LEFT REAR AIR SUSPENSION BAG HAS FAILED AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AS THE CAR SITS OFF CAMBER WHILE PARKED.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT MY VEHICLE HAD ONE OWNER, A MIDDLE AGED FEMALE, MY WIFE DRIVES THE CAR TO THE SUPERMARKET AND KIDS SCHOOL, NOT THE RACE TRACK SO THE FAILED GASKET IS CLEARLY NOT THE RESULT OF ABUSIVE DRIVING, RATHER A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT.  ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP, THE 4.8 LITER V-8 IN MY 2008 X-5 HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM IN THE BMW 5,6 AND 7 SERIES.

A FEW MILES LATER A WARNING CAME ON STATING ENGINE WAS RUNNING HOT, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ALLOWED IT TO COOL DOWN. AFTER IT COOLED DOWN I DROVE 2 MORE MILES TO MY OFFICE AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK TO SEND TO BMW DEALERSHIP.   BMW INFORMED ME THE ELECTRIC WATER PUMP WENT OUT AND NEED REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF $1400.00.  INTERNET SHOWS 38,000 RECALLS OF X-5 FOR WATER PUMP PROBLEM BUT JUST MY LUCK MY CAR IS EXCLUDED.  I AM WAITING ON A RESPONSE FROM BMW USA REGARDING MY REQUEST TO HAVE ISSUE COVERED.    MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 40,000 MILES AND WE HAVE ALREADY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP, THE FUEL PUMP RELAY AND NOW THE WATER PUMP. THIS CAR WAS OVER $70,000 WHEN PURCHASED AND YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  *TR",

HOME, 115 MILES AWAY).  THE SERVICE CENTER FIXED MY CAR AT A COST OF $1,400, AND THEY TRACED THE PROBLEM BACK TO AN ELECTRIC WATER PUMP FAILURE.

WHEN MY HUSBAND BROUGHT THE CAR HOME TO ME I WAS VERY UPSET BECAUSE THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE, NOT AS LOUD AS BEFORE. I CALLED BMW AND MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT, CITING THAT THIS PROBLEM HAD NOT BEEN RESOLVED AND IT NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN.

I BACKED UP INTO MY ORIGINAL SPACE AND CALLED THE BMW DEALER WHO SENT A TOW-TRUCK TO DELIVER THE CAR TO THEIR SHOP.  BMW SENT A FIELD TECHNICIAN TO INSPECT THE CAR ON 4/20/2010.  I RECEIVED AN EMAIL STATING NO MECHANICAL FAULTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY ANYONE AND THE CAR WAS READY TO BE PICKED UP  OR A $25/DAY STORAGE FEE WOULD BE CHARGED TO US.  I TOLD THEM I WOULD NEVER TAKE THE MORAL OR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN SO THEY AGREED TO DELIVER IT TO OUR HOME.  I SENT AN EMAIL TO THE DEALER'S MGR. AND CALLED HIM SEVERAL TIMES TO ASK FOR A REPURCHASE OF THE CAR.  WE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.  WE WERE FORCED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY WHO CONTACTED THE DEALER AND BMW REGIONAL OFFICE.  THE REGIONAL OFFICE REVIEWED THE SERVICE RECORD AND REFUSED TO BUY BACK THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALER SAID THE DECISION BY BMW REGIONAL OFFICE COULD NOT BE CHANGED.  THIS LEFT US WITH NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO PAY OFF THE LEASE ONE YEAR EARLY AND GET THE CAR OUT OF OUR POSSESSION.

I LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGES BEFORE HE RETURNED MY CALL. THE UPDATE WAS INSTALLED ON OCT 14, 2008. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPROVEMENT TO THE HESITATION/STALLING.

I NEVER HEARD FROM ANYONE AGAIN AT BMW SERVICE. I HAD A NEAR MISS ACCIDENT AGAIN. BMW IS HIDING THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM FROM THE PUBLIC!!

ON THE OTHER HAND THIS CAR HAS TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS AND THERE WERE NEVER LOW PRESSURE WARNING. I HAVE MADE A RESEARCH ON THE WEB AND FOUND OUT THAT DUNLOP TIRES HAD SO MANY CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE AND HIGH COURT JUDGE FOUND DUNLOP GUILTY FOR 300 INCIDENTS INVOLVING A FAULTY BRAND OF TIRE, WHICH CAUSED AT LEAST ONE FATAL MOTORWAY SMASH.

I SAID FINE AND THEN RECEIVED A CALL THE NEXT DAY SAYING MY CAR WAS READY.  WHEN I PICKED IT UP THEY DIDN'T REPAIR ANYTHING THEY SAID THEY WERE TOLD BY MUNICH TO JUST RESET THE LIGHT AND CLAIM ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS!!    ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 5TH WHILE TRYING TO CROSS AN INTERSECTION I WAS ALMOST T-BONED WHEN MY CAR AGAIN LOST POWER.  THEN ON SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 6TH THE ENGINE LOST POWER AGAIN AND SAME MESSAGE POPPED UP ON THE IDRIVE SCREEN.  WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER I WAS TOLD THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL INJECTION WAS A \"HIGH PROFILE\" PART IN MUNICH AND THEREFORE THEY WERE TOLD TO JUST RESET THE LIGHT TO SEE IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM OUTRAGED THAT BMW PUT MY FAMILY IN SUCH DANGER SO AS TO NOT HAVE TO REPLACE HIGH PROFILE PARTS.      PLEASE INVESTIGATE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH BMW THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT COMES ON WITHOUT NOTICE OR WARNING POWER JUST IS GONE.
