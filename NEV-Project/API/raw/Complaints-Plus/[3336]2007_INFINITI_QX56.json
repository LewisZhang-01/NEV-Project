I HAVE TO MAKE A SHARP CURVE OUT TO THE EMERGENCY LANE AND SLIDE MY CAR OUT TO ACCESS ROAD. AFTER FINALLY SLOWING DOWN THE CAR AND PULLED OVER TO A PARKING LOT. I NOTICED THE BRAKE LIGHT ON THE DASH IS ON. FORTUNATELY I DIDN'T HAVE A COLLISION WHEN DOING THE CURVING, SLOWING DOWN AND DRIVING, WITH A USELESS BRAKE. AND ALTHOUGH MY FAMILIES WERE SCARED TO DEATH, THEY WERE NOT HURT. FINALLY, I MANAGED TO DRIVE HOME FROM LOCAL ROAD, UNDER 20MPH WITH EMERGENCY FLASHING ON. AND ONE DAY LATER I MANAGED TO DRIVE THE QX56 TO SEWELL INFINITI DEALER AT DALLAS. AND AFTER INSPECTION, THEY TOLD ME THE BRAKE BOOSTER SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE, AND THE REPAIR COST WOULD BE ~ $1,400.  *TR",
