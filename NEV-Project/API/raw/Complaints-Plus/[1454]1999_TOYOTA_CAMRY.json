THEY INSPECTED THE CAR AND SAID IT WAS MECHANICALLY SOUND. THEY ADMITTED AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION THE ACCELERATOR CABLE WAS FROZEN.

SHE AGAIN TRIED TO START THE CAR AND RPM'S WENT TO THE MAX AND THE AT THAT POINT SMOKE STARTED RISING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. SEVERAL PEOPLE CAME TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND TRIED TO HELP TRAFFIC MOVE AROUND THE VEHICLE.

THE FACTORY-INSTALLED CD/CASSETTE/RADIO SYSTEM HAS BEEN REPLACED THREE TIMES, AND NOW THE CD PLAYER PART YET AGAIN DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.    AT ONLY ABOUT 10000 MILES, THE AIR FLOW RATIO SENSOR AND MANIFOLD HAD TO BE REPLACED.

THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE ODOMETER READ 16603 MILES. THAT WAS WHEN THE IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE WAS FIRST REPLACED. THE SITUATION SEEMED TO IMPROVE, UNTIL 34800 MILES, WHEN THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH IT NOT STARTING AND BEING VERY WEAK RESUMED. AT 35394 MILES THE IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE WAS REPLACED FOR A 2ND TIME. AT 47000 MILES THE SAME PROBLEMS RESUMED. AT 49180 MILES, THE CAR WOULD (AS USUAL) NOT START UNLESS THE ACCELERATOR WAS PRESSED FOR 1 MIN. THEN IT RAN AT ONLY 500 RPM. AS IT WAS THEN BEING DRIVEN OUT OF AN ALLEY, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY SPONTANEOUSLY BOOSTED TO 1200 RPM, NEARLY CAUSING A COLLISION. THIS TYPE OF IMPETUOUS ACCELERATION STARTED FREQUENTLY OCCURRING.    TOYOTA REFUSED TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM, ONLY SAYING TO USE PREMIUM GASOLINE, WHICH PROVED TO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.    NOW THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OF THE CAR HAS COLLAPSED THREE TIMES AT 72173 MI, 75009 MI, AND TODAY (2010-03-11) AT 75024 MI.    THE DISHONESTY OF TOYOTA PERSONNEL IS SEEN IN ITS REFUSING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND EARLIER IN FRAUDULENTLY CANCELING THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM THAT WAS PART OF THE PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE AFTER THE CAR WAS PAID FOR AND ITS REFUSAL TO RESPOND TO WRITTEN COMMUNICATION. *TR",

AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO PASS THE BRISTOL ST. EXIT IN COSTA MESA, MY WIFE SUDDENLY HEARD AN UNUSUAL NOISY SOUND AND DETECTED THE STRONG SCENT OF OIL AND GASOLINE LEAKING FROM THE ENGINE.  IMMEDIATELY, MY WIFE MANEUVERED OUR CAR TO THE RIGHT-HAND SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY.  ONCE MY WIFE PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THE CAR ENGINE SUDDENLY EXPERIENCED COMPLETE FAILURE AND WOULD NOT RE-START.    OUR CAR WAS TOWED BY 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE TO ACCU AUTO SERVICE (23253 MADERO #A-104, MISSION VIEJO, CA 92691) FOR REPAIR.  SINCE WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON OUR CAR TO COMMUTE TO WORK EVERY DAY, IT WAS CRUCIAL THAT WE RECEIVED IMMEDIATE SERVICE ON OUR CAR.  AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC EXAM, ACCU AUTO SERVICE DETERMINED THAT THE ENGINE EXPERIENCED SUDDEN AND TOTAL FAILURE (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PICTURES) AND WAS COMPLETELY REPLACED AND SERVICED.      SINCE WE BOUGHT OUR TOYOTA CAMRY LE ON 4/10/99, IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY THROUGH THE ?GOLD SEAL MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN SERVICES CONTRACT LIMITED, AND WE ARE HOPING THAT YOU CAN HELP US WITH A REIMBURSEMENT OF OUR REPAIR COSTS.  DUE TO THE DEPENDENCY ON OUR CAR FOR SURVIVAL, WE HAD TO AUTHORIZE AN IMMEDIATE REPAIR.  THROUGH THE LIFE OF OUR TOYOTA CAMRY LE, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A GOOD MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE AND UPKEEP, WHICH CAN BE VERIFIED THROUGH LEW WEBB'S IRVINE TOYOTA, INC. (30 AUTO CENTER DR., IRVINE, CA 92618) AT 949-768-0688 OR ACCU AUTO SERVICES AT 949-859-9637.  WE HOPE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR SITUATION AND ARE ABLE TO HONOR OUR WARRANTY BY GRANTING US A REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIR OF THE DEFECTIVE CAR ENGINE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND TIME.

I LEARNED THIS WHILE I WAS OUT CAR SHOPPING (AT A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP) SINCE I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE ON THE ROAD IN MY UNSUITABLE TOYOTA CAMRY.

HOWEVER, WHEN I DID THE INITIAL TEAR-DOWN OF THE TIMING AREA, I FOUND A RATHER SURPRISING SCENARIO.  THE TIMING BELT WAS INTACT.  THERE WERE NONE OF HE USUAL OIL LEAKS FROM THE CAM/CRANK SEALS.  THE BELT WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.  THE WATER PUMP HAD SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC BEARING FAILURE.  IN FACT, I FOUND PIECES OF METAL IN THE TIMING AREA, AS WELL AS A FEW OF THE BALL BEARINGS FROM THE WATER PUMP SHAFT BEARING.  THE   TIMING AREA ALSO HAD TRACES OF ANTIFREEZE (OEM ANTIFREEZE) FROM WHERE THE   WATER PUMP HAD BEEN LEAKING PRIOR TO THE FAILURE.  AS PER OUR   DISCUSSION, I PROCEEDED TO TEAR THE ENGINE DOWN FURTHER TO INSPECT FOR OTHER   POSSIBLE DAMAGE.  AT THIS TIME, WE WERE SIMPLY EXPECTING TO FIND A   WARPED/POSSIBLY CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD.  UPON REMOVING THE NECESSARY   COMPONENTS REQUIRED TO REMOVE THE HEAD, AND REMOVING THE HEAD ITSELF, I   INSPECTED THE BLOCK, CYLINDERS, AND PISTONS.  THE INSPECTION REVEALED   THAT THE PISTONS HAD SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE.  THERE IS OVER THIRTY   THOUSANDTHS OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TOP EDGE OF THE PISTON AND THE   CYLINDER WALL.  THE TOP PISTON RING IS CLEARLY VISIBLE.  THEREFORE, I   MUST DECLARE THE ENGINE A LOSS.     IN FACT, I HAVE MADE THE OBSERVATION THAT   TOYOTA VEHICLES USING THE OEM ANTIFREEZE USUALLY HAD FAR FEWER COOLING   SYSTEM PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND.    IN THEIR VEHICLES.  I HAVE TWO TOYOTA PICKUPS.  ONE HAS A REMAN   ENGINE.  IT HAS OEM ANTIFREEZE AND AN OEM OIL FILTER.    TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, I FEEL IN MY OPINION, AND MY EXPERIENCE,   THAT THIS PROBLEM IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.

I HAVE TRIED DEALING WITH THE DEALER REP AND HE AND THE REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER TELL ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY SHOULD DO ABOUT IT AND I SHOULD EXPECT TO BE DOING THIS AGAIN EVERY TWO YEARS.

THESE PROBLEMS WERE MOSTLY CORRECTED BY A REWIRE THAT WAS DONE IN OCTOBER 1999.  OCCASIONALLY, THOUGH, A WINDOW WON\u0012T OPEN STILL.  THE BRAKES FIRST FAILED IN THE WINTER OF \u001200-01, AND I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE.  THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR, SINCE THE PROBLEM RARELY OCCURRED.  IT BECAME MORE FREQUENT AND PRONOUNCED, HOWEVER. EVENTUALLY IN JULY 2001, I SLID THROUGH AN INTERSECTION ON A HOT SUNNY DAY ON DRY ROADS.  I WAS CONVINCED THE CAR WAS NOT PERFORMING PROPERLY.  AT THIS POINT (AUGUST 2001), IT IS UNSTEADY ENOUGH ON GOOD ROADS THAT I BRAKE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AT ALL TIMES.  TWICE, NOW, IN THE LAST WEEK THE ABS HAS ENGAGED WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT ENGAGED \u0016 ONCE DURING ACCELERATION, ONCE WHEN COMPLETING A STOP (THAT STARTED AT ABOUT 15 MPH). THE THIRD DEALERSHIP I CONTACTED LISTENED TO THE PROBLEM CAREFULLY AND THEN EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE CAR WAS PERFORMING EXACTLY AS DESIGNED, AND THIS \u0013SAFETY\u0014 FEATURE (THE ABS) WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT FROM LOSS OF CONTROL. I CAN CERTAINLY CONTROL THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR WELL WHEN IT\u0012S SKIDDING, BUT I CONSIDER THE ABILITY TO REDUCE SPEED AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF CONTROL.  IF A CHILD ON A TRICYCLE CROSSED UNEXPECTEDLY IN FRONT OF ME, I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THE CAR COULD NOT BE STOPPED IN TIME TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, NO MATTER HOW SLOWLY I WAS GOING.  THE ABS \u0013TAKES OVER\u0014 EVEN AT VERY LOW SPEEDS (0-15MPH), TRIPLING MY STOPPING DISTANCE ON THE DRIEST, SMOOTHEST ROADS. I KNOW THIS WOULD BE A COMPELLING SUIT COMING FROM THE ATTORNEY OF A CRIPPLE, BUT I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN BEING SAFE AND ALIVE.

HE SAID IF I CAN PROVE TO TOYOTA SUCH AN UPGRADE IS AVAILABLE THEY WILL FIX IT BUT WILL DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OTHERWISE.
