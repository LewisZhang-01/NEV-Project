THE DRIVER WAS WITHIN THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF 35 MPH.  AS THE DRIVER APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION, THE LIGHT WAS RED.

AFTER CAR HAD BEEN PARKED FOR 30 MINUTES, THE CAR WOULD WORK IN NORMAL DRIVE GEAR BUT STILL DID A HARD POP TO SHIFT GEARS WITH A HARD ACCELERATION. MECHANIC DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION  WILL GO INTO NEUTRAL AND THAN POP INTO GEAR.  FORD IS AWARE OF ISSUE AS HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON CORRECTING THE ISSUE.  A TRANSMISSION WITH ONLY 70000 MILES SHOULD NOT BE SHIFTING INTO NEUTRAL BY ITSELF WHICH CREATES A POTENTIAL FOR AN ACCIDENT ESPECIALLY ON A HIGHWAY THAT MAY NOT HAVE SHOULDERS FOR THE DRIVER TO MOVE ITS NOW SLOW VEHICLE OUT OF TRAFFIC.  *TR",

THEN WENT BACK UP A BIT TO 18.5 MPG AND NOW IT IS AGAIN 16.5 MPG.  I AM FURIOUS AND WILL BRING BACK TO COLONIAL NISSAN IN FEASTERVILLE WHERE I BOUGHT MY CAR.  HUGE MPG DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE US EPA MPG AND THE CURRENT HORRIBLE MPG WORSE THAN MY 1993 NISSAN MAXIMA WHICH IS 20 MPG!  IS IT THE ETHANOL IN THE GAS?  IS IT A PROBLEM WITH THE GAS/AIR RATIO?  ALSO, NOTICED PEDAL ACCELERATION ISSUE.  LATELY NOT SMOOTH ACCELERATION... CAN PUSH PEDAL AND NO CHANGE IN ACCELERATION FOR TOO LONG A TIME.  WHAT IS GOING ON????  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS FRAUD.  THANK YOU.  IF IT IS SIMPLY AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE SOFTWARE THEN I'M OKAY WITH THAT BUT IT THE MPG IS THIS BAD I'M TRADING IT IN... *TR",
