Trying to remove could cause the car to fall off the jack?  For safety I had to order all new lug nuts, with different size sockets to remove the old, and use the designed 19mm to reinstall the new lug nuts.

Sounds like a bad sensor, right? I\u2019ve kept up on my recalls and it had been replaced when that recall came out. I told my mechanic about the issue when I brought it to the shop for oil change and brakes/tires/rotors. He could not replicate the problem because the car kept clearing the code and it never misfired when he started it. (I should mention that at first this was an intermittent issue when it started in July.) I had no choice but to drive the car when I went to visit my mom 5 hours away in early august. I went to start the car in her driveway one morning and within seconds the temp gage went all the way to hot. Obviously the car can\u2019t actually overheat that fast, but regardless, it went into limp mode. This time the coolant level actually was low, however not so low as to merit what was happening. I topped off the coolant level. Started it again. Same thing happened again. Called tow truck to bring to the shop. When we loaded it onto the tow truck it started up and didn\u2019t throw any codes. WTF?! So it goes to the shop and again they can\u2019t replicate the problem. Said a mechanic drove it for over an hour and nothing happened. I pick the car up and drive it back home.

They said I have cracks in cylinder walls and there\u2019s significant amount of coolant in the engine. The mechanic said he\u2019s been seeing this happening with a lot of the 1.6 eco boost engines.

In the affected vehicles, snow or water containing road salt or other contaminants may corrode the electric power steering gear motor attachment bolts.\u201d  I live in NC and the vehicle has been through 3 Winters which could be responsible for the issue since salt is constantly spread on the roads to make driving conditions safer when ice and snow are present; however, NC is not one of the states being included in Recall number 15S14.

I REPLACED THE OEM LOW PRESSURE FUEL SENSOR (11/8/2019) AS SUGGESTED BY OTHERS EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES FOR LIKE MODEL VEHICLES. THE ENGINE HAS CONTINUED TO MISFIRE AND STALL AFTER REPLACING LOW PRESSURE FUEL SENSOR. DURING A RECENT INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE BY A LOCAL SERVICE CENTER (3/17/2021), THE TECHNICIAN NOTED THAT THE ENGINE COOLANT WAS ABNORMALLY LOW. THE ENGINE MISFIRES AND LOW COOLANT SUGGEST A POSSIBLE COOLANT INTRUSION INTO ENGINE CYLINDERS. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH OTHER LIKE MODEL FORD VEHICLES WITH ECOBOOST ENGINES (SEE TSB 20-2100). IN MY OPINION, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF INJURY TO OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE AS THE MISFIRES AND STALLS ARE MORE LIKELY WHEN THE ENGINE IS COLD AND THE DRIVER IS ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STATIONARY POSITION. E.G. TURNING ONTO A BUSY STREET AND MERGING WITH TRAFFIC. FORD SHOULD REPLACE HEAD GASKET FOR AFFECTED VEHICLES AND SMALL BLOCK FOR CUSTOMERS WHO EXPERIENCE COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE.",

AT LEAST TWO OWNERS REPORTED A COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE OF THEIR 73,000 MILES VEHICLES. THE OWNERS MENTIONED THAT THEY PERFORMED REGULAR MAINTENANCE TO THE VEHICLE, AND THEY DID NOT SEE ANY WARNING SIGNS THAT COULD POINT THEM TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE THE COMPLETE FAILURE.

THE BUSHING WAS STILL ON THE SHIFTER LINKAGE AT THE TRANS.I PERCHESED A NEW BUSHING PART \"DG9Z-7K340-A. I INSTALED THE NEW BUSHING AS PER THE RECALL INSTRUCTIONS.  I AM CONCERNED THIS RECALL DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, AND MAY HAVE MADE IT WORSE. I STILL HAVE THE OLD BUSHING IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING IT I WILL SEND IT TO YOU.  THANK YOU   TAYLOR  '",

WHEN I CAME OUT THE NEXT MORNING IT FAILED TO START WITH THE REMOTE. WHEN I GOT IN AND TRIED TO START IT, IT STILL WOULD NOT START AND IT PROVIDED NO WARNING LIGHTS. HAD SOMEONE ATTEMPT TO JUMP IT WHICH OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WORK, SO WAS IT TOWED TO A NEARBY FORD SERVICE CENTER. THE SUMMARY OF THEIR DIAGNOSTICS WAS AS FOLLOWS: THERE WAS NO COOLANT (WHICH I HAD PUT SOME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS PRIOR, AFTER THE CAR DID PROVIDE A WARNING THAT IT WAS OVERHEATING. I HAD PRESUMED THAT THE FORD QUICK LANE FORGOT TO CHECK MY COOLANT LEVELS WHEN IT WAS THERE 5/13/20 AND AT THIS TIME IT WAS LOW BUT NOT EMPTY), SPARK PLUG NUMBER 2 HAD COOLANT ON IT, CYLINDER #2 ALSO HAD COOLANT IN IT, AND AFTER CLEANING ALL SPARK PLUGS AND REINSTALLING THEM WHITE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE TAIL PIPE WHICH SMELLED LIKE COOLANT. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I REPLACE THE BATTERY AND GET A NEW ENGINE AT WHICH THEY GAVE ME A QUOTE OF $6526.86. AFTER DOING RESEARCH AND ASKING A NON-FORD MECHANIC, HE AGREED IT WAS A FORD DEFECT. FORD WAS NOTIFIED VIA PHONE AND A CASE NUMBER WAS PROVIDED, BUT SAID THEY COULD NOT HELP WITH THIS MATTER. THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE THE 1.6L AND 2.0L HAD THAT WAS RECALLED AND FORD ACKNOWLEDGES THE ISSUE WITH THE 1.5L IN SSM 48106. REALLY SUCKS BECAUSE THE CAR RUNS GREAT OTHER THAN THIS ISSUE AND IS CURRENTLY PARKED WHILE MAKING A DECISION TO FIX OR SELL.

THE CAR BARELY RAN AND WE PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT IT OFF AND RESTARTED IT AFTER ONE MINUTE.  IT THEN RAN BETTER AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HOME.

THE DEALER FOUND NO STORED DTCS FROM THE INCIDENT, BUT AFTER SIGNIFICANT TESTING, THE CAR SET P0570 - UNABLE TO MAINTAIN IDLE SPEED.

THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AS IT FAILED WITHOUT WARNING AND COULD HAVE PUT US IN SERIOUS DANGER IF WE WERE ON A CROWDED INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.

IT HAD THIS PROBLEM THE REST OF THE SUMMER WHILE THE TEMPERATURES OUTSIDE WAS HOT.  IT IS APRIL 2019 AND JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WE HAD A WARM DAY AROUND 75 DEGREES. I LEFT FOR WORK STOPPED AT THE END OF MY DRIVEWAY HAD THE CAR IN PARK AND LEFT MY DOOR OPEN WHILE I GOT THE MAIL. GOT BACK IN AND AGAIN DID NOT HAVE AIR AND COULD NOT ROLL THE WINDOWS DOWN. EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS THE RADIO WILL NOT WORK EITHER. LAST YEAR DURING THE TIME THE AIR AND WINDOWS WERE  NOT WORKING MY BATTERY WAS DEAD WHEN I WAS GOING TO GO TO WORK ONE MORNING. TOOK IT OUT AND WENT AND HAD IT TESTED AT LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE. THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A BATTERY THAT THEY COULDN'T READ LIKE THAT BEFORE. IT'S LIKE THE BATTERY WAS FRIED. ALONG WITH THOSE PROBLEMS LAST YEAR MY CAR WAS STATIONARY AT HOME IN MY DRIVEWAY AND I WENT TO GET IN MY CAR AND MY DOORS WERE LOCKED I TRIED THE REMOTE AND THE KEYLESS ENTRY AND NOTHING WOULD UNLOCK MY DOORS. SO I HAD NO ACCESS TO GET INTO MY CAR. A FEW DAYS LATER I TRIED AGAIN AND IT UNLOCKED. I'VE ALSO CAME HOME A COUPLE TIMES AT NIGHT IN THE PAST WEEK AND NOTICED THE INSIDE LIGHTS WHERE THE AIR/HEAT & RADIO CONTROLS ARE IS FLASHING ON AND OFF AND THE OUTSIDE GROUND LIGHTS UNDER THE MIRRORS ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOOR ARE ON. I HAD TO UNHOOK BATTERY.  NO KEYS IN IGNITION AND CAR IS STATIONARY IN MY DRIVEWAY. I THINK THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE WHEN YOU HAVE NO AIR AND YOU CAN'T ROLL DOWN YOUR WINDOWS IN HOT WEATHER AND ALSO WHEN YOU GET LOCKED OUT OF YOUR CAR.

THE RECALL COVERS CARS FROM 2012 THROUGH 2018 WITH 2-LITER FOUR-CYLINDER ENGINES.\"    I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEY KEEP DIAGNOSING IT AS A BAD FUEL SENSORS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED.  WELL, I'VE REPLACED THEM ALREADY AND THE SAME PROBLEM KEEPS HAPPENING.  I CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP PAYING THE DEALER FOR SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS AN ISSUE THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF SINCE THEIR OTHER VEHICLES WERE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.",

IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THE FACT THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON BEFORE OR AFTER THE INCIDENT TRANSPIRED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE VEHICLE'S SAFETY SYSTEM GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. THIS SAFETY DEFECT IS IN BREACH OF THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ACT.

THE BUSHING THAT ATTACHES THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER CABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION MAY DEGRADE OVER TIME AND CAUSE THE BUSHING TO DETACH FROM THE TRANSMISSION.

CONSEQUENCE  IF THE VEHICLE IS EXITED WITHOUT THE TRANSMISSION BEING IN PARK AND WITHOUT THE PARKING BRAKE BEING APPLIED, THE VEHICLE MAY UNEXPECTEDLY MOVE, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  WHAT OWNERS SHOULD DO  FORD WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE SHIFTER CABLE BUSHING, FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN JULY 30, 2018.

I THOUGHT IT WAS ICE UNTIL I STOPPED AT A LIGHT & MY WHEELS STARTED SPINNING AND I COULD HARDLY MAINTAIN CONTROL. I FELT LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TAKING OVER AND I WAS FIGHTING IT AS I KEPT SLIDING. THIS WENT ON THE ENTIRE TWO MILES TO WORK. I'D NEVER BEEN MORE TERRIFIED. I'VE DRIVEN IN SNOW AND ICE FOR 20 YEARS AND THIS IS MY 6TH FORD AND I HAD NEVER BEEN SO AFRAID OF A CAR. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A ONE TIME ISSUE, MAYBE IT REALLY WAS JUST A STRANGE ONE TIME THING? BUT ON SUNDAY 3/25/18 IT WAS RAINING HERE IN COLUMBUS AND I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40-45 MPH ON A WET ROAD AND MY CAR STARTED ACTING LIKE IT DID IN THE SNOW, BUT THIS TIME I LOST TOTAL CONTROL OF THE CAR TC CAME ON AND ONCE AGAIN I COULD NOT CONTROL MY CAR AND THE WHEEL JERKED TO THE RIGHT CAUSING US TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL. THE BACK PASSENGER TIRE HIT A CURB, WE SPUN AROUND AND THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE HIT THE CURB AND WE WENT INTO A GRASSY AREA COMING PRETTY CLOSE TO A POLE AND AN APARTMENT BLDG. I ENDED UP WITH A FLAT TIRE, BENT RIM, I NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT, THE PAINT IS SCRATCHED UNDER MY CAR, AND I NEED A NEW BARING ON THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE. ALSO - I FOUND OUT THERE WAS AROUND 5 INCHES OF WATER IN MY TRUNK DUE TO A BROKEN SEAL. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER & I BEGGED THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG. RIGHT NOW THEY CLAIM NOTHING IS WRONG BUT THEY ARE FIXING THE LEAK & THE DAMAGE. I PAID FOR A NEW TIRE. I AM BEYOND TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. I HAVE NEVER LOST CONTROL OF A CAR BEFORE AND NOW I HAVE IN THIS CAR -  TWICE IN LESS THAN A MONTH. SOMETHING IS VERY VERY WRONG. THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP OR SUGGESTIONS. I JUST WANT A SAFE CAR.",

I COULD TELL BY SPINNING THE PUMP THAT THE BEARINGS HAD FAILED, MORE THAN LIKELY DISINTEGRATED AND THE SHAVINGS WERE SITTING INSIDE MY ENGINE.

THEN THEY CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP IT TILL THE NEXT DAY.  WE CHOSE TO GO GET THE CAR AND TAKE IT BACK TODAY (3/22). THE SERVICE MGR. CALLED THIS MORNING LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE \"WATER RUNNING SOUND\" IS NORMAL IN THE 2014 MODEL.  THEN HE STATED WITH A CHUCKLE THE SOUND IS \"LIKE LITTLE ROACHES RUNNING AROUND IN THE DASHBOARD\" AND HIS SERVICE TECH FOUND DOCUMENTATION ISSUED BY FORD ENGINEERING CONFIRMING THIS SOUND IS NORMAL. MIND YOU THIS PERSON IS A PROFESSIONAL....HE MAKES A COMMENT  AS THIS!  I LET HIM KNOW WE HAD PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 2007 FORD FUSION AND NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE. HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY. I FIND HIS COMMENT SOMEWHAT COMICAL BUT VERY INSULTING; AND I ASKED HIM TO EMAIL ME THE DOCUMENTATION.

THE CAR HAD APPROXIMATELY 48,000 MILES WHEN THIS OCCURRED.  I TOOK IT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE FORD DEALER WHERE I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR.  I PAID $99.95 TO HAVE THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT NEEDED A GATEWAY MODULE THAT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $300, BUT THE $99.95 WOULD GO TOWARDS THAT COST.  WHEN THE PART CAME IN AND INSTALLED, THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAD TOLD ME THAT THE GATEWAY MODULE MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST WOULD BE $707 AND THE SHOP WOULD NEED MY CAR FOR TWO DAYS.  I ALSO WOULD NEED TO BRING ALL MY KEYS FOR THE PROGRAMMING.  THIS ALL SEEMS TO BE A STEEP PRICE TO FIX A DISPLAY PANEL THAT I USE ONLY FOR AN ODOMETER AND SOMETIMES FOR TRIP MILEAGE.  I SAW ON THE SERVICE BULLETIN NO. ASI-44742 THAT OTHER 2013-2014 FORD FUSIONS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND THESE CARS NEED THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER  REPLACED DUE TO PROGRAMMABLE MODULE INSTALLATION.  I HAVE NOT HAD THE CLUSTER REPLACED BECAUSE THE PART HAS TO BE SPECIAL ORDERED.  I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WERE OTHER OPTIONS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  *TR",

MY CAR STARTED BUCKING FORCEFULLY WHEN COMING TO A STOP AND AT THIS POINT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ALSO CAME ON. I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR A LITTLE OVER YEAR AND IT HAS 25K MILES ON IT. THERE IS NO REASON TO BE EXPERIENCING SUCH TROUBLE WITH A BRAND NEW CAR. SLOWLY BUT SURELY I MADE IT TO THE DEALER AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TECHNICIAN KNEW THAT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION. A FEW DAYS AT THE SHOP TURNED INTO A WEEK, THEN A WEEK TURNED INTO TWO WEEKS, AND NOW TWO WEEKS HAS TURNED INTO THREE WEEKS AND THE CAR IS STILL NOT FIXED. IM TOLD OF THE MANY PARTS ORDERED ONE IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER WHICH MAKES ME EXTREMELY CONCERNED AND UNFORTUNATELY EXTREMELY UNSAFE TO EVEN DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. TERRIFIED SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS CAN HAPPEN NEXT TIME. VERY UNSATISFIED WITH FORD AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR VEHICLES.",

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE COMPLAINT IS THAT NON-DRIVER ASSIST PACKAGE FORD FUSION MODELS COME STANDARD WITH BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WHICH ALLOWS THE DRIVER TO SEE THE BLIND SPOTS WITHOUT HAVING TO TURN THE HEAD (TURNING THE HEAD WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ACCIDENT) BUT THE DRIVER ASSIST PACKAGE MODELS ONLY HAVE BLIS AND BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE INDICATOR THE DRIVER CANNOT ADD A THIRD PARTY BLIND SPOT MIRROR TO AUGMENT THE INEFFECTIVE BLIS. BLIS SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS, NOT REPLACE THEM WHEN THEY DO NOT MEET THE SAME FUNCTIONS AND DOES NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED (EVEN WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TIMES WHEN FORD SAYS BLIS DOES NOT WORK). THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO FORD'S ATTENTION TO NO AVAIL. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SEVERAL TIMES WHEN DRIVING THAT I'VE PERSONALLY ALMOST HIT SOMEONE BECAUSE THE INDICATOR WAS NOT TRIGGERED OR WHEN HAVING TO TURN MY HEAD TO DOUBLE CHECK WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC, BOTH OF WHICH WERE NOT AN ISSUE WITH MY PREVIOUS NON-DRIVER ASSIST PACKAGE MODEL.  *TR",
