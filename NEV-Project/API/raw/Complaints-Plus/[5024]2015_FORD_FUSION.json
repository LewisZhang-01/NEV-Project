Upon inspection, there was leaking of coolant into the cylinders and now the engine has to be replaced. The total cost for repairs is approximately $8300. I'm told that the problem has been corrected in the new engines. After talking with Ford Service and a local car repair shop in Franklin, KY, I learned that this is a common problem with Fusions and Escapes and both have replaced many motors. Unfortunately, my car has not been recalled nor was I made of the widespread problem through Ford (my engine is a 1.5-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine).  I have done further research into the matter and I'm shocked and disappointed that Ford has not been transparent with consumers about this matter. I have taken immaculate care of my car, serviced it routinely, and always quickly responded to recalls. Now that I know more about the faulty engine, I do recall some random symptoms such as the car loosing a bit of power, smoke out of the exhaust, and the car shaking when started in the morning and having to restart it. All of the symptoms were random and did not consistently happen so I really didn't think much about it.   I have a call into Ford's Customer Care Team and they are checking into the matter further. I noticed there's a class action lawsuit filed in Delaware about the engine problem. The firms representing the plaintiffs are Berger Montague PC and Capstone Law APC. I'm thankful that this issue did not put me in arm's way or the safety of others were put at risk.",

It would sit for a minute or two and start and run fine.  There were no check engine lights or gage to show the car was running hot.  I never dreamed it was a cracked cylinder.  The Dealer performed EEC test diagnosis and found previous misfies in cylinder 1 in mode 6 of PCM. Found coolant level low, pressure tested cooling system and found that cylinder 1 with coolant intrusion.  Short block replacement.  I see online that there have been recalls on 2013 -2014 Ford Fusion and other 2013-2015 vehicles for this exact problem of a lack of coolant circulation causing an engine to overheat resulting in a crack in the cylinder head.  In these models dealers were installing a coolant level sensor with supporting hardware and software at not charge to customer. Ford dealer is charging me $5,000 for short block replacement, which I feel is a defect of the Ford Engine Design. I purchased by car in Nov. 2014 so it only makes sense that this engine had the 2014 design problem.  I declined repairs at that moment, to investigate the problem and asked for my car.  The dealer stated they had to put my car back together so it would be about 20 mins.  When I got the car back it seems to be running normal like when I took it in, but down the road about 3 miles the car started to sputter and stalled.  After sitting a few minutes with flasher on in traffic on a major road, the car would start up and wouldn't go over 15 mph and continued to stall.  I called dealer and they gave me the number to the towing company they use.  The car was towed back to dealership.  The Ford dealer is charging me $5,000 for short block replacement. They did file a complaint with Ford Motor Co. Customer Relationship Center and they stated the dealer had opened a case by no programs in place for assistance. The dealer is telling the consumer this occurred due to a Ford design flaw. If this is a Ford design flaw this should be a recalled item.",

Upon leaving the store my shifter became extremely difficult to move into reverse to pull out of the parking spot. Once I got out of the spot it was even harder to move it into drive. Once it was in drive I drove it back into the parking spot and restarted the car. At this point it was still difficult to put the car into reverse so I figure I would drive the 5 minutes home and figure out what was going on after I got back. Upon getting home I went to put the car into park again and it was stuck in drive even though the shifter indicated the car was in park. I did some research and found there was a recall for certain 2013 - 2016 Ford Fusions because the bushing that connects the shifter cable to the transmission may degrade and break over time. On January 3rd I got the car towed to the dealership for the repairs and found that my car was not covered under this recall (Ford recall # 19S16, NHTSA Recall # 19V362000) as it was not manufactured at one of the locations identified under this recall. The dealership referred me to a corporate representative who told me they could not add my VIN to the recall, however they urged me to contact the NHTSA to see if my VIN could be added to this recall as this is the same issue as outlined within the recall.",

They said someone bottom your car out so I turned it in to the insurance and they started a claim Ford fixed it. 2 days later it did It again over heated. Take it back in they fix it again pick it up again 2 days later over heats again. This is the third time it\u2019s been in there and this time they say there is a TSB technical service bulletin-21-2269 that\u2019s been out for over a year. At this point they tell me that no one has issued a recall on it. For the safety of others it should be recalled because if I had my kids in the call and got hit or killed over it someone would be paying.",

The vehicle is now at Mullinax Ford in Mobile Alabama. The address is 7311 Airport Blvd. Mobile Alabama, 36608. The phone number is 251-261-0238. The vehicle has 80 thousand miles on it. I have kept it in excellent condition due to the fact that I do not want her to breakdown in the middle of the road. However, I never expected that the vehicle would autonomously accelerate and potentially kill her due to a wreck. I am concerned that the vehicle can no longer be trusted. What can be done to resolve the issue? Will the manufacturer pay for the fix? Will the fix be professional, and actually remedy the malfunction? Do I have a legal avenue of approach? Will you please have someone investigate, and rectify. Can my daughter please have a temporary, or permanent  replacement?

A few weeks ago, the car would not start or shift out of park. A jumpstart was attempted and but the car still would not start. When trying to start the car, the warning chimes were beeping rapidly and the following message cycled on the display: see manual, steering assist fault service required, service AdvanceTrac, low engine oil pressure, engine coolant overtemperature, park brake malfunction service now. The car was towed to a Ford dealer. The dealer advised the battery, starter and alternator were fine. They said the car was fine and it then drove without issue for a couple weeks.   A few weeks later while driving, it completely shut off and would not start in a turn lane. The headlights turned off and would not come on. The hazard lights were turned on but only worked on the mirrors, not the front or rear hazard lights. This was extremely dangerous as it was dark out and we were almost hit from behind. The police were called and blocked the vehicle for safety. The tow truck driver was unable to jumpstart the vehicle or get it out of park with a jumpstart power applied but all the displays were working normal so it was not an issue with the battery. The same warning messages that were displayed weeks earlier were displayed again after the car turned off: see manual, steering assist fault service required, service AdvanceTrac, low engine oil pressure, engine coolant overtemperature, park brake malfunction service now.    The vehicle was towed to the same Ford dealer that said there were no problems a few weeks ago and it is acting the same as the day the the car stopped working in the middle of the intersection.

The fluid was everywhere. The dashboard light came on when it happened. Thankfully I was not driving on the highway or this could have been fatal. The car is now 6 years old and I get regular oil changes and inspections along with routine maintenance. I carefully drove it early in the morning to a mechanic close by and it was confirmed that my brake hydraulic hose had ruptured. Mechanic says usually doesn't see happening this early on in car life. I have 75,000 on it. He recommended I replace the other 3 but cannot afford right now. The labor is expensive part. Also. Had to perform a brake bleed and add fluids again and clean up. A little over $400.00 just for that one side. Brake pads themselves are still good. Tires still good. Hope the others don't happen while driving in faster conditions or in traffic. This is dangerous, just hope I am the only one in the car when it does happen. Am planning on saving to fix the other hoses soon. I had zero warning indicators before it occurred.

I continued to drive the car to work and errunds with no issue, except for about 3 days after gas fill-up when my engine light came on. Although the car ran fine, on Tuesday August 2 2021, I went to local Auto Zone and they ran the diagnostic that indicated a P1450 error which said on the report \"Replace Evaporative Emissions (EVAP) Purge Control Valve\". The following morning  August 3rd, I called my Ford Mullinax dealership when they opened at 7:30, and the closest appointment was not until Monday August 16th ! (a quailfied local mechanic said he could not do the work and would actually have to send the car to Ford himself.)  On the following day August 4th, I drove the car to work (a 76 mile round trip primarily on the interstate). The car ran fine on the way there and up to a point on the way back, until the engine made a intermittent very loud noise and did so after several times after, until the engine completely and unexpectedly shut down and narrowly missing a very dangerous rear end collision. I called AAA to tow my car, and when the driver arrived 25 minutes or so, the car was in a position which made it difficult to place on his flatbed tow truck that he arrived with. He asked if I could start it up, and I said I doubt it would but I was willing to try. Much to my suprise it fired righ up! I assume that it had time to cool down and that this was only temporary. Definetly NOT SAFE to assume everything was now ok ! From that 8/4/2021 day until today as I document this incident on 8/9/2021, I have been fortunate enough to borrow a friend's 2nd vehicle",

        "summary": "BLUF:  Safety issue related to the brake sensor pad failing, resulting in unpredictable engine performance.  On 02JUL21, I went to eat lunch and parked my car as normal.  When I returned to my car, I noticed that my brake lights were still on, despite the engine being off and me being away from the car for 30 minutes.  At the time, i assumed that I must have bumped the key fob buttons, and did not overthink it.  However, as I drove the vehicle, I noticed significant loss of engine power as I sped up.  As in, I would attempt to accelerate (normal rate, not aggressive), and at some random point, the engine would lose power (as though in limp mode), and would not respond to further throttle input.  This could be resolved by lifting my foot completely off the gas pedal and reapplying pressure.  Then I would accelerate again for approx. 2-3 seconds, then encounter another loss of power (and corresponding loss of speed).    As a result, my speed on the road was unpredictable, as the car was not responding to my throttle inputs properly.  After a nerve-wracking drive like this, I attempted to troubleshoot the car, and found that the spacer/bearing pad that the brake sensor bears on had fractured into pieces and was no longer functioning.  It appears that the car's computer believed that the brakes were being applied when they were not, and so the computer was putting the car into some sort of reduced power mode, but not giving any check engine light warnings or similar notifications (I checked with an OBD reader, no codes given).  Ford does not sell a replacement part for this pad, so I have rigged up a short-term alternative, but I am concerned that if it, too, fails - or for anyone else encountering this problem - the erratic speed and inability to control the car will result in a traffic accident.",

I have a 1.5 ecoboost engine and notice some white smoke coming out tail pipe some mornings when reversing out of driveway on rear camera. I had to order coolant and meanwhile took it straight to my mechanic who can't find a problem. Where did the coolant go? There are no codes popping up. I get regular oil changes and maintenance. I thought my engine was going to blow up. I've never drove a car and saw the temp guage at the top without some sort of steam or loss of power.

My mechanic drove it onto freeway and says guage goes up and down but doesn't know why. I hear a watery sound by my feet sometimes when accelerating from a stop.

Already having to pay 200.00 to diagnose and potentially another 200.00 for further testing. I'm at 71,000 miles now and out of warranty.",

THE ONLY THING AT THIS POINT I NOTICED WAS TWO CRACKED SPARK PLUGS, SO I REPLACED ALL OFF THEM. AFTER THAT THE CAR STARTED SO I THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED. CLOSED THE HOOD TURNED THE CAR TO OFF, THEN TRIED TO START IT AGAIN. IT DID NOT START. SO I CHECKED ALL THE FLUIDS AND SEEN THE ANTIFREEZE DISAPPEARED, I HAD PREVIOUSLY FILLED IT. I LOOKED FOR ANY VISIBLE LEAKS, PUDDLES, AND CHECKED FOR WET CARPET AND FOUND NOTHING. I WENT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER LARGE JUG OF ANTIFREEZE PUT IT IN AND WATCHED IT ALL DISAPPEAR BEFORE MY EYES. I COULD NOT FIGURE IT OUT, BUT I GOT THE CAR STARTED AND STILL CONTINUED TO GET MASSIVE ERROR CODES, WHITE SMOKE, ROUGH SOUND, ETC. THEN SEARCHED MORE AND FOUND IT SOUNDS LIKE BLOWN HEAD GASKET, I CHECKED AND THE OIL HAD A MILKY TINT. THIS I THEN FOUND WAS A RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE, SO I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE FROM FORD ON MARCH 20, 2021 AND THEY SAID THEY NEEDED TO CHECK IF MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP HAD THE PARTS TO GET MY CAR IN OR IF THEY NEEDED TO ORDER THE PARTS. I WAS SUPPOSE TO GET A CALL BACK BUT HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING. I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING, I DID USE LEAK FIX IT SEEMED TO STOP THE LEAK AND CLEAR THE CODES BUT MY DASH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEEPS FLASHING SO I DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE FURTHER DAMAGE.

MY CONCERN NOW IS THAT IS LOOSING COOLANT FROM THE RESERVOIR WHEN IS ON PARK OVERNIGHT. I ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT COOLANT EVERY MORNING TO GET IT GOING OTHERWISE A WARNING LIGHT COMES OFF TO WARN ME ABOUT THE COOLANT BEING LOW. IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEK NOW AND IS KINDA TIRING GOING TO THE SAME STEP EVERY MORNING. I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE AND AFTER SEARCHING FOR AWHILE IT CAME UP THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE AS ME. I READ AN ARTICLE STATING THAT SOME ECOBOOST ENGINES ARE EXPERIENCING LOSS OF ANTIFREEZE AND SOME OF EM EXPERIENCING DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBLEMS WITH THEIR ECOBOOST ENGINES. HONESTLY I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING. I'M WONDERING IF FORD IS GOING TO RECALL ALL THE ECOBOOST ENGINES THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT.

HE SAID HE HAD 8 OTHER VEHICLES ON THE LOT NEEDING THE SAME REPAIR AND EVEN IF THEY HAD THE PARTS IN STOCK, WHICH THEY DON'T AND IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO GET THEM, IF WOULD BE 6 WEEKS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR.

I TELL THE MANAGER I'M AWARE IT'S ILLEGAL TO SELL A CAR WITHOUT A HORN AND THAT I'VE BEEN DUPED SO I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND HIS ANSWER WAS NO THAT HE ALREADY RECEIVED MONEY FROM A BANK ON MY BEHALF. I TOLD HIM HE HAD TILL THE END OF 6/10 TO GIVE ME A ANSWER ON WHEN IT WOULD BE READY OR I WOULD GET A LAWYER SO HIS ANSWER WAS NO MATTER WHAT HE WOULD CALL ME BY 5PM THAT DAY WITH A STATUS UPDATE BUT HE NEVER CALLED.

SHE INSISTED THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK WITH THE CAR AND REFERENCED THE INSPECTION LIST I WAS GIVEN FOR MY 2015 FORD FUSION SE. NOT THREE WEEKS LATER, THE ENGINE LIGHT WENT FROM BEING CONSTANTLY ON, TO FLASHING. THIS ALSO CAUSED AN INTENSE WHITE SMOKE FROM THE EXHAUST AND A STRONG GAS PRESENCE IN THE VEHICLE.

SINCE THE ISSUE WAS NOT CAUSED BY ME I WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CHARGES AND AFTER WEEKS OF IGNORING ME, FORD MOTOR COMPANY (OFFICE OF ELENA FORD) DECIDED TO GET INVOLVED.

THE LIGHT WAS ON WHEN I PULLED IN THE PARKING LOT SO IT IS MY BELIEF THEY CLEARED THE CODE WITHOUT PERFORMING A DIAGNOSTIC TEST. JUNE 29 THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. JUNE 30 I STOP AT AN AUTO PARTS STORE THAT DOES A FREE DIAGNOSTIC. THE RESULTS WERE MISFIRE ON CYLINDER 2. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP JULY 1ST AND PRESENTED THEM WITH THE INFORMATION FROM THE AUTO PARTS STORE. THEY CONFIRMED THE MISFIRE AND REPLACED THE COIL PACK AND THE SPARK PLUG. ON JULY 3 AFTER DRIVING 100+ HIGHWAY MILES I PARKED THE CAR AND SEVERAL HOURS LATER WHEN I RETURNED THE CAR STALLED WHEN I STARTED IT. IT TOOK 3 ATTEMPTS BEFORE THE CAR STARTED. THE ENGINE WAS SPUTTERING AND THE LIGHT CAME ON BRIEFLY. JULY 12TH, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE. THE CAR CONTINUED TO DRIVE NORMALLY. I PARKED THE CAR AT MY HOME. JULY 15TH STARTED THE CAR I COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF WATER RUSHING THROUGH THE DASH. I DROVE THE CAR 3 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP AND NOTICED WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM THE TAILPIPE. I LEFT IT FOR A DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION. THE FOLLOWING WEEK THE DEALERSHIP CALLS TO TELL ME THE CAR NEEDS EXTENSIVE ENGINE REPAIRS HEADS, GASKETS, ETC. AUGUST COMES AND THE DEALERSHIP STILL HAS MY CAR. A FEW WEEKS LATER I'M TOLD THE PARTS ARE ON BACK ORDER AND THERE IS NO EXPECTED ARRIVAL DATE. OCT 30 ALL PARTS ARE IN AND THE REPAIRS START. THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND THE ENGINE FAILED AT THE DEALERSHIP. I'M TOLD ON NOV 7 THEY ARE ORDERING A NEW ENGINE. THE ENGINE WAS INSTALLED AND REPAIRS WERE COMPLETE ON NOV 15TH, MORE THAN 4 MONTHS LATER! THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND FORD NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!!",

WE BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE UNSAFE, AND FORD WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR REPAIRS AS THE COMPUTER SHOWS THE CODE THAT WOULD STATE THE ISSUE HAS HAPPENED AGAIN, BUT BECAUSE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT CAUSE THE CODE TO OCCUR A THIRD TIME, THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING WELL. AGAIN, WE BELIEVE THIS IS WRONG AND WISH TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AWARE OF A VERY REAL SAFETY ISSUE. WE HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER ABOUT THE ISSUE. OUR SERVICE ADVISER IS [XXX] FROM MOCK FORD (SHOULD BE NOTED THIS IS NOT HER FAULT NOR I BELIEVE MOCK FORD) AND THE FORD REP IS [XXX],  866-631-3788 X77756 . WE DO NOT KNOW AT THIS TIME IF THE ISSUE HAS BEEN REMEDIED. ONLY THAT THROUGH A TEST DRIVE IT COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE COMPUTER LOG SHOWS THE INCIDENTS. SHOULD WE JUST IGNORE THIS AND HOPE FOR THE BEST?    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TT",

WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER REMOVED THE PARKING BREAK THE CAR WAS STILL OUT OF GEAR AND THE OPEN DOOR KNOCKED HIM OFF BALANCE.

I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT THE PARTS PUT ON MY VEHICLE ARE GOING TO LAST. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE RECALL, I WAS TOLD THAT THE RECALL WAS NOT IN EFFECT YET, BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE UNAVAILABLE.

I JUST PURCHASED THE ABOVE VEHICLE ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO. IT IS BRAND NEW. THIS VEHICLE COMES WITH A FEATURE CALLED \"ACTIVE PARK ASSIST.\" IT IS NEW TO ME AND HAVE NEVER OWNED A VEHICLE WITH THIS FEATURE PREVIOUSLY. YESTERDAY, I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. I TURNED IT ON AND LET IT PARALLEL PARK FOR ME. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS ON THE VEHICLE VIDEO SCREEN AND TOOK MY HANDS OF THE WHEEL. THE VEHICLE THEN BACKED INTO THE SPACE AND STRUCK THE CAR PARKED BEHIND. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS STUNNED. THE DIRECTIONS IN FORD'S MANUAL ARE SOMEWHAT, AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, UNCLEAR. ON PAGE 180, IT SAYS \"THE DRIVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AVOIDING HAZARDS AND MAINTAINING A SAFE DISTANCE AND SPEED, EVEN WHEN THE SYSTEM IS IN USE.\" ON PAGE 182, THE MANUAL STATES \"IF YOUR VEHICLE SPEED EXCEEDS 6MPH, THE SYSTEM SWITCHES OFF AND YOU NEED TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF YOUR VEHICLE.\" I'M STILL UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER THE BRAKES ARE OPERATED BY THE VEHICLE DURING PARKING ASSIST OR ME. FOR NOW, I'M NOT USING IT.  THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AT THIS.  REGARDS,  *TR",
