        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 1994 TOWNCAR ON THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING 2011 WITH MY CHILD IN THE CAR WITH ME THE BRAKES FAILED COMPLETELY AND WITHOUT WARNING THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR. I PUMPED THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH NO EFFECT.  I WAS FORCED TO TAKE EMERGENCY EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID OTHER VEHICLES WHILE APPLYING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  WHEN IT WAS STOPPED, I LOOKED UNDERNEATH THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND SAW A COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE BRAKE LINE WHICH PORTS HYDRAULIC BRAKE FLUID TO THE REAR BRAKES.  THE MASTER CYLINDER HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DRAINED BY THE RUPTURE.  I HAVE OWNED THE TOWNCAR SINCE DRIVING IT OFF THE DEALER LOT AS A BRAND NEW CAR IN MAY 1994 AND RELY ON THE CAR FOR DAILY TRANSPORTATION.  SADLY, I CANNOT DRIVE THE CAR NOW.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THIS INCIDENT.  IS THERE A RECALL OUT ON THIS?  *TR",
