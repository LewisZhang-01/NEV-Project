THE CROSSMEMBER IS AN IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF ANY  VEHICLE. IT SUPPORTS THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR AND CARRIES THE WEIGHT OF THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION.

THE EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED ON AUGUST 2018. AFTER THE SECOND BULLETIN WAS ISSUED, THERE WAS A PERIOD OF 13 MONTHS BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED AND WHILE I OWNED THE CAR. I WAS NOT CONTACTED OR MADE AWARE BY FCA IN ANY WAY THAT THE VEHICLE I WAS DRIVING HAD A KNOWN ISSUE AND THAT I COULD HAVE IT ADDRESSED WITHIN EXTENDED WARRANTY.

I ASKED ABOUT IT AND THEIR SOLUTION WAS THEY OFFERED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR 10 YEARS AND THAT MY WARRANTY EXPIRED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO SO I WAS OUT OF LUCK. MY FAMILY'S SAFETY HAS AN EXPIRATION??? I AM THE ONLY OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE AND NEVER HAD MY FRAME CHECKED NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S UNSAFE TO DRIVE. SINCE THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND BECAUSE IT WASN'T A MANDATED RECALL THEY ONLY HAVE TO FIX THE ONES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO A DEALER WITHIN 10 YEARS? IF THEY FIX SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS EXTENDED WARRANTY. THIS SEEMS UNFAIR. THEY USED SUB PAR PARTS AND NOW CONSUMERS ARE THEY ONE PUTTING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK.

I WAS ABLE (JUST BARELY) TO AVOID A HEAD ON COLLISION WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE AND PARKED THE CAR; IN THE PREVIOUS 30 DAYS I HAD SEVERAL REPAIRS MADE THAT INCLUDED THE ALTERNATOR AND BATTER, ET CETERA.  VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE REPAIRING SHOP WHERE A NEW ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY WERE INSTALLED, THEN TONIGHT 20150411 THE BATTER LIGHT HAS AGAIN COME ON WITH FLUCTUATING SPEEDS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED AND READ ABOUT MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH THE DODGE CALIBER REGARDING THE TIPMS SYSTEM OR SUCH; THE FACT THAT THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO MAKE THE REQUIRED REPAIRS TO THESE VEHICLES IS ATROCIOUS.  THE LIVES OF OTHER VEHICLE OPERATORS ARE BEING PUT AT RISK; I'M CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING MORE SHOULD BE DONE.  *TR",

SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE HAS HAD THE SAME ISSUE SO I EMAILED DODGE TO LET THEM KNOW THIS AND TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE ETC.

FIVE SECOND LATER AND AFTER PULLING OVER AS CLOSE AS I COULD TO THE CURVE OF THE ROAD,  THE CAR DIED. I TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAY OF THE TRAFFIC, BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT START. SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT UNDER THE HOOD, AND AFTER FURTHER EXAMINATION, I SAW SPARKS AND SMOKE COMING OUT OFF THE FUSES' BOX. I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND WAITED FOR THE SMOKE TO CLEAR UP. USING A FLASH LIGHT, I FOUND OUT THAT  ONE OF THE CIRCUIT CARD IN THE TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE (TIPM) SHORTED AND MELTED PART OF THE PLASTIC COVER.  THE VEHICLE COULDN'T BE PUT IN NEUTRAL, AND THE BREAK PEDAL AND STEERING WHEEL WERE INOPERATIVE. IF THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED IN A HIGH WAY, I AM SURE THAT THE INCOMING TRAFFIC COULD HAVE HIT MY CAR WITH SPEED OVER 65MPH DUE TO SUDDENLY DECELERATION AND LACK OF VEHICLE'S RESPONSE TO THE DRIVER'S COMMANDS.

THIS WAS RATHER DANGEROUS AS I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED NUMEROUS TIMES DESPITE HAVING MY EMERGENCY SIGNAL FLASHING LIGHTS ON AS WELL AS DRIVING IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE.

THE FAILURE OF THE OXYGEN SENSOR NEARLY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT AS THE DODGE CALIBER WAS ALMOST IMPACTED BY OTHER CARS IN TRAFFIC AS THE OTHER CARS WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THE DODGE CALIBER TO RAPIDLY DECELERATE FROM 45MPH TO 7MPH.    THE PART WAS REPLACED ASAP THE NEXT DAY WITH BOSCH PART # 15124 AND UPON TESTING FOR 20 MINUTES THE CAR OPERATED WITHOUT ERROR.    I CALLED DODGE TO INQUIRE ABOUT A RECALL OR WARRANTY WORK AND THEY DECLINED BOTH.    IN REGARD TO PUBLIC SAFETY, I REQUEST THAT A CASE BE OPENED TO INVESTIGATE THIS SITUATION AND OTHERS LIKE IT.

I WAS RECENTLY INVOLVED IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT, AND A NATIONWIDE CLIENT REAR-ENDED MY NEW 2008 DODGE CALIBER. IT WAS LESS THEN 1 WEEK OLD AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, AND HAD FEWER THEN 300 MILES ON IT. NATIONWIDE PROMPTLY AGREED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE BY REPLACING THE BUMPER. HOWEVER, IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO REPLACE THE BUMPER WITH A REFURBISHED PART, OR A PART MADE BY A COMPANY THAT MAY NOT BE LICENSED OR REPRESENT MOPAR, THE PARTS COMPANY THAT SUPPLIES DODGE REPLACEMENT PARTS.     I AM VERY CONCERNED NOT ONLY ABOUT LOSING VALUE FOR MY BRAND NEW CAR, BUT ALSO THAT MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF MY PASSENGERS COULD BE POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED BY THE USE OF POSSIBLY INFERIOR PRODUCTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A GOVERNING BODY FOR THESE TYPES OF PARTS KNOWN AS CAPA, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY PART IS CERTIFIED BY CAPA, NOR COULD I FIND A CERTIFIED PART LISTED FOR THE REAR BUMPER OF A 2008 DODGE CALIBER. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND NATIONWIDE MUST REPLACE MY BUMPER (AND ANY UNSEEN DAMAGED PARTS) WITH GENUINE MOPAR-SUPPLIED PARTS TO RESTORE MY VEHICLE TO ITS ORIGINAL, SAFE, OPERATING CONDITION AS IT WAS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE HASN'T EVEN BEEN FULLY BROKEN-IN YET.  *TR",
