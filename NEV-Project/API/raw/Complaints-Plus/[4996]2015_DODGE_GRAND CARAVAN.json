Then when I went to accelerate I had no power to move forward. Rpms would go to 4000 but vehicle would barely move. Once I was able to safely get off highway I had to call for a ride home.

Got home and I searched for  any recalls for my type of vehicle and I seen there was a recall for this problem and the recall number was s44. But when I put my vin number in it says my vehicle wasn\u2019t covered for this recall. Well obviously it should be covered because of the faulty transmission pump stranding me on the highway. This recall should be extended to more vehicles like mine. I have called Chrysler and I am awaiting any info from them wether they are going to pay for this. The vehicle is a 2015 but only has 56000 miles on it! No way this part should fail with that amount of low miles on it. It should be covered under the recall s44! Please let me know what I can do about this if they fail to cover me under this recall. While I\u2019m only assuming this is the problem with the vehicle due to recalls being issued for it I will be taking it to a garage to be fixed but would like to be reimbursed if this is the problem with my vehicle!

WHEN I INSPECTED THE INSIDE OF THE HEADREST, THE PLASTIC BRACKETS THAT HOLD THE METAL PIN WERE COMPROMISED. THE METAL PIN IS STILL IN PLACE, BUT THE PLASTIC PRONGS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO HOLD ONTO THE PIN TO KEEP THE HEADREST IN PLACE BOTH FAILED. ONE CRACKED AND IS PARTIALLY ATTACHED. THE OTHER PRONG CAME OFF COMPLETELY. I BELIEVE THE PLASTIC BROKE FROM BEING UNDER PROLONGED TENSION. WHY WOULD SOMETHING THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE A SAFETY FEATURE BE MADE OUT OF SOMETHING AS FLIMSY AS PLASTIC? I'M SO THANKFUL THAT I WASN'T DRIVING WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURIES. THERE ARE MANY OTHER REPORTS OF DODGE CUSTOMERS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. THE ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT (AHR) SYSTEM SHOULD BE RECALLED DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS. THE HEADREST SHOULD NOT DEPLOY BY ITSELF. UNFORTUNATELY, FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, DODGE IS CLAIMING NO RESPONSIBILITY AND THE ISSUE IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE REPAIR IS AROUND $900, BUT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THAT AND DON'T WANT TO PAY IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. DODGE SHOULD BE REPAIRING THESE HEADRESTS AT NO COST TO THE CUSTOMERS.",

THAT AFTERNOON, I (RELUCTANTLY) DROVE THE VAN THE 25 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP, LEANING FORWARD AS FAR AS I COULD IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT IN CASE IT WERE TO DEPLOY.    THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME TODAY, WEDNESDAY 5/29, TO INFORM ME THAT CHRYSLER REFUSES TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECT, AND WOULD CHARGE NEARLY $900 TO COVER THE NEW HEADREST.

DODGE CUSTOMER CARE PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH A TECHNICIAN FROM MOPAR, THE COMPANY THAT SUPPLIES THE STOW-AWAY ROOF RACK.  THAT IS WHEN I LEARNED THAT MOPAR WILL NOT SUPPLY THE STOW-AWAY RACK TO THE DEALERSHIPS BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE PUT ON AT THE FACTORY.  HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DRILLING AND PUTTING SCREWS INTO THE ROOF.  NOT ONLY COULD AN AIRBAG DEPLOY WHILE THE RACK IS BEING INSTALLED, BUT IF A SCREW IS TOUCHING OR IN NEAR CONTACT WITH THE AIRBAG OR WIRING, THE SYSTEM COULD FAIL LATER.    THIS MEANS THAT THE 14 SCREWS THAT WERE DRILLED INTO THE ROOF COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT BY DEPLOYING THE AIR BAGS PREMATURELY OR THEY MAY NOT WORK AT ALL IN AN EVENT THAT REQUIRES THEM.  SO FAR NO ONE FROM DODGE WILL PUT IN WRITING THAT MY VEHICLE IS SAFE AND THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
