I have found that both issues and parts are actually covered in other years, but not mine, which I have confirmed with a local dealer.  With only 68800 miles, these should both be fully covered manufacturer repair since they are safety-related and there are numerous similar reports.  There was no \"crash\" or \"injury\" per the questions below, BUT there should have been, and there was not, only because I was able to regain just enough control of the car to avoid a crash.  If someone else was driving, it would most certainly have been a crash with injuries, possibly involving other vehicles if I didn't happen to be close to home and the only car around at the time.  Based on my experience so far, I don't think I will be owning or buying any Hyundai products any time soon and will likely sell this one if I can get it repaired.  It is sitting in my garage useless right now.  I have now submitted a contact request to hyundaiusa.com asking for them to cover these repairs, and will update with their response.",
