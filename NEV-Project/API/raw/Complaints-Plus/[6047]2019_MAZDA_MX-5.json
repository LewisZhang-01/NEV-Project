NOW SOME 15,832 MILES LATER AND LESS THAN 3 YRS., I AM TOLD THAT THEY HAVE \"MICRO CRACKS\" AND SHOULD BE REPLACED.  CLOSER RESEARCH REVEALED THAT THESE ARE \"SUMMER TIRES\" THAT \"FLEXING OF THE SPECIALIZED RUBBER COMPOUNDS USED IN MAX PERFORMANCE SUMMER TIRES DURING COLD-WEATHER USE CAN RESULT IN IRREVERSIBLE COMPOUND CRACKING. COMPOUND CRACKING IS NOT A WARRANTABLE CONDITION BECAUSE IT OCCURS AS THE RESULT OF IMPROPER USE OR STORAGE, TIRES EXHIBITING COMPOUND CRACKING MUST BE REPLACED.\"  AT NO TIME WAS I WARNED THAT DRIVING WITH THESE TIRES IN THE WINTER COULD CAUSE THIS DAMAGE.  MORE IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THEY GET DANGEROUSLY LITTLE TRACTION UNDER THESE COLD CONDITIONS-ESPECIALLY WITH EVEN A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF SNOW.  A CONSUMER SHOULD BE WARNED ABOUT THIS FORESEEABLE DANGEROUS CONDITION-ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS CAR IS SOLD IN A STATE WITH SEVERE WINTERS.",
