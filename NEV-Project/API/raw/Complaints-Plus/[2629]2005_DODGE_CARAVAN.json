        "summary": "The door locks do not work for the sliding doors or the passenger side of the vehicle. We tried to fix this issue by checking the door lock fuse out to make sure it was okay, and it was. The driver's side is the only one that locks. The passenger door lock will not push down and lock when pressed down manually. I feel this is a safety issue and I have seen that others online are having problems with their door locks not working or getting stuck and not unlocking. I don't understand why there is no recall on this issue with the 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan. This is a serious safe issue on any vehicle. My sliding doors have to be manually locked and as I said, the passenger side won't lock, so it's dangerous for me to have passengers. My local Dodge dealership offered to diagnose it, but it's $125.00 for them to just find out what's causing this if they could even do that. Clearly it is an issue of some kind since one door locks. Can you please look into this? Again, I know others have had door lock issues with the Dodge Caravan. Why hasn't this been fixed and recalled already? This is very frustrating. Also, I don't remember the exact date I purchased my vehicle in June, so I've given it my best guess. Thank you for your time in reviewing this. Resolution that fixes this for myself and everyone else who is dealing with this, would be much appreciated.",

THE FURNITURE FELL OUT  OF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK FORCED MYSELF AND ANOTHER DRIVER IN FRONT OF ME TO  SLAM ON OUR BRAKES.  I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED MY BRAKES HOWEVER THE ABS DID NOT  ENGAGE AND I SKIDDED INTO THE CHEVY SILVERADO TRUCK THAT WAS TRAVELING IN  FRONT OF ME.  I LEFT TWO 50FT SKID MARKS (MY ESTIMATE) BEHIND ME.  ULTIMATELY, THE FAILURE OF THE ABS SYSTEM CAUSED ME TO IMPACT THE REAR OF THE  SILVERADO.  ADDITIONALLY, AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY  UPON IMPACT.  I WAS LATER INFORMED BY DODGE/CHRYSLER, WHO I COMPLAINED TO,  THAT BASED ON THE AREA OF IMPACT THE SENSORS WERE NOT DAMAGED, WHICH IN-TURN  WAS THE DETERMINING FACTOR WHY THEY DIDN'T DEPLOY.

THIS MEANS THAT SOMEONE MUST CLIMB THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE'S INTERIOR TO LET OTHER PASSENGERS IN.

ALSO, THE DOOR LOCK SWITCHES ON THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR DO NOT ACTIVATE THE LOCKS. YOU CAN LOCK AND UNLOCK MANUALLY BY USING THE BUTTONS ON EACH DOOR - MANUALLY PUSHING THEM DOWN TO LOCK OR RAISING THEM UP TO UNLOCK. HOWEVER, THAT IS HARD TO DO ON A VAN AS LOCK BUTTONS ARE NOT EASILY REACHED.      WHILE THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT OR DAMAGE FROM OUR FAILURE, I CAN SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF A PROBLEM, AS AN EXAMPLE : 1) A PERSON THINKS THE DOORS ARE LOCKED AND A CHILD IS ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING, 2) A PERSON LEAVES THE VEHICLE IN A PARKING AREA THINKING THE DOORS ARE LOCKED WHEN THEY ARE NOT AND SOMEONE BREAKS INTO THE VEHICLE TO STEAL IT OR TO HIDE AN ATTACK THE DRIVER WHEN THEY RETURN.

THERE IS ONLY ONE KEY ENTRY TO THE VAN ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WHICH MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER AND TRAVEL.

THE SERVICE GUY DID STATE THAT IT PROBABLY NEEDED A \"SOFTWARE UPDATE\".  THE IMPACT SENSOR RECALL WAS NOT COMPLETED DUE TO THEM NOT HAVING THE PARTS. NOW 2 WEEKS LATER STILL NO PARTS FOR THE RECALL (IMPACT SENSORS) AND THE DOOR LOCKS QUIT WORKING AGAIN.  THIS TIME I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY CABLE TO RESET THE COMPUTER. AND IT WORKS FINE.

FIVE DAYS LATER THE HOSE ON THE OUTLET TUBING COMING THROUGH THE FIREWALL FROM THE HEATER CORE CAME OFF OF THE TUBING, CAUSING THE RAPID LOSS OF ALL THE ENGINE COOLANT.  THE DEALER CLAIMS THAT THEY DID NOT TOUCH THIS HOSE DURING THE ENGINE COOLANT REPLACEMENT ON 1/10.  THEY CLAIM THAT IT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT THE HOSE CAME OFF FIVE DAYS AFTER THEY SERVICED THE VEHICLE.  THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT IT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT THE CLAMP THAT HOLDS THE HOSE IN PLACE WAS FOUND TO BE ABOUT 4 INCHES FURTHER BACK FROM THE CONNECTION END OF THE HOSE THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY CLAMP IT ONTO THE TUBING.  EVEN THOUGH THE CLAMP WAS FIRMLY COMPRESSING THE HOSE IN THE WRONG POSITION THAT IT WAS FOUND AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE DEALER MAINTAINS THAT IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED BY ITSELF, OR BY SOMEONE WHO SERVICED THE VEHICLE BEFORE THEM.  AS THE VEHICLE WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED WITH 5 YEAR / 100,000 MILE ENGINE COOLANT, THE COOLANT SYSTEM HAD NEVER EVER BEEN SERVICED BEFORE 1/10/08.  THIS WAS THE FIRST ENGINE COOLANT SERVICE, FOLLOWED BY THE FIRST SPONTANEOUS DETACHMENT OF AN ENGINE COOLANT HOSE.  SINCE THE DEALER IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SERVICE PROCEDURE, THEN THE PROBLEM HAD TO BE CAUSED BY SOME KIND OF DEFECTIVE CONDITION THAT IS INHERENT TO THE HOSE, TUBING, AND/OR CLAMP THAT CHRYSLER/DODGE USES ON THE 2005 CARAVAN.  THE RAPID LOSS OF ENGINE COOLANT IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS, UNSAFE, AND LIFE-THREATENING EVENT.  THIS INCIDENT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED, BECAUSE MOST OF THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES CARRY YOUNG CHILDREN WHO COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF THE ENGINE COOLANT IS RAPIDLY LOST UNDER CERTAIN TRAFFIC, WEATHER, OR ROADWAY CONDITIONS.  *TR",
