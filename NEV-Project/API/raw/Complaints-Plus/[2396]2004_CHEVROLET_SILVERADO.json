I applied fluid all the way home at a speed of 45mph in a 70 mph limit which caused a major safety hazard with traffic. Took to trans shop said the 3-4 clutch was fried and was no good due to overheating and loss fluid from damaged gasket that's split on the stamps from AC Delco. 2nd issue arises out 1rst, even more dangerous to point of dragging me down drive way and cutting into my leg leaving a small scar. When wheels are chalked , E brake applied the vehical should not move, so after doing so I climbed under and unhooked the shift cable from the trans instantly with dog in truck it began rolling right over me I grabbed the frame and stopped it for a few sec then boom it went again I had spin around or my legs or head would've be smashed to Oblivion. At that point it just kept going as it cut into my leg, I let it roll over me hopped up and tried trow it in park yet no cable attached it wouldn't stop and just kept going till it hit a small ditch at end my drive and half way in the road.My leg was cut and I was scratched up in many spots yet dog was ok. The trans quitting lead to the unhooking of the cable then the e/p brake not holding due to worn brake shins in the rear which have calipers so if the calpier would've held with the brake it'd been fine but under everything is a set small and thin pads that hold the truck when brake applied. There was a recall (#05042). Yet my vin was not included, chevy was called yet denied any responsibility of either matter or action to cure it. These defects could've killed me, decapitated, or killed my service dog!",

I'VE RECEIVED A LETTER BACK FROM ESIS RELATING THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF MY CLAIM, BASED ON ALL DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED. ALSO TELLING ME THAT IF I HAVE ANY FURTHER EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY CLAIM TO PLEASE SUBMIT IT TO THEM.   ARE PICTURES OF A TOTALED OUT VEHICLE THAT SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE BUT YET NO SIGNS OF AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT NOT PROOF ENOUGH?  I'VE ASKED ESIS HOW MANY MORE VEHICLES LIKE OURS MAY BE OUT THERE. NO RESPONSE.   MY HUSBAND SUFFERED SEVERE BRAIN TRAUMA, A BROKEN NECK, STERNUM, FOUR BROKEN RIBS, BROKEN RIGHT LEG IN MULTIPLE PLACES AND A BROKEN LEFT ARM THAT WAS ALSO BROKEN IN MULTIPLE PLACES.   HE HAD HIS ACCIDENT ON MARCH 12TH 2018 AND DIED AS A RESULT OF IT ON AUGUST 7TH  2018.  ESIS HASN'T OFFERED TO PROVIDE ME WITH A COPY OF THEIR FINDINGS NEITHER.

THE 4 LINES WERE SEVERELY RUSTED AT THE POINT OF THE PLASTIC CLIPS THAT SECURE THE LINES TO THE FRAME OF THE TRUCK.  THE PLASTIC CLIPS THAT HOLD THE BRAKE LINES HOLD MOISTURE AND SALT AND CAUSE ALL THE BRAKE LINES TO CORRODE AT THOSE POINTS.  IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO RUST IN THE LINES TO THE REAR OF THE TRUCK OR AT BOTH REAR BRAKE CALIPERS.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR OR LACK OF MAINTENANCE.  I CLEAN THE UNDERSIDE OF MY VEHICLE EVERY WINTER.  THE LINES ARE RUSTING AS A RESULT OF THE CLIPS RETAINING SALT AND CORROSIVES AND CAUSING YEAR ROUND CONTACT TO THE BRAKE LINES.

I BELIEVE THE BRAKE LINES USED ON THESE TRUCKS TO BE OF SUCH INFERIOR QUALITY THAT SUDDEN FAILURE IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE.  2- MY TRUCK HAS DUAL TANKS FOR DIESEL FUEL AND THEY HAVE WORKED SPORADICALLY FOR YEARS.  I DID NOT SEE THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE AS MUCH AS AN INCONVENIENCE.  HOWEVER WHILE MY TRUCK WAS IDLING ON A HOT SUMMER DAY I NOTICED DIESEL FUEL DRIPPING OUT OF THE FRONT TANK FILLER CAP.  APPARENTLY THE PUMP THAT PUMPS THE FUEL FROM THE REAR TANK TO THE FRONT TANK WAS RECEIVING A SIGNAL TO PUMP EVEN THOUGH THE FRONT TANK WAS COMPLETELY FILLED.  IT WAS CONTINUING TO PUMP AND LEAKING THE FUEL OUT THE FILLER NECK.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD TO ME.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE FLOAT THAT STICKS IN THE REAR TANK, THE SENDING UNITS THAT FAIL, A WIRING GROUND ISSUE OR SOME OTHER ELECTRONIC GLITCH.

I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF A 2004 CHEVROLET SILVERADO 2500 FOUR WHEEL DRIVE WITH THE DURAMAX DIESEL AND ALLISON TRANSMISSION. ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2015, SHORTLY AFTER A FUEL STOP, I WAS TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE 24 NEAR PADUCAH, KY.  AT APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH IN THE LEFT LANE WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET, I EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER ACCOMPANIED BY A LOUD ENGINE RATTLING, AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. WITH SOME DIFFICULTY IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AT ABOUT 25 MPH ON THE SHOULDER. SINCE I WAS JUST A FEW MILES FROM THE PADUCAH EXIT, I LIMPED THERE AND INTO A HAMPTON INN PARKING LOT.  AAA RESPONDED AND TOWED THE TRUCK TO ROYAL OAKS CHEVROLET IN PADUCAH.  SINCE IT WAS A SUNDAY, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS CLOSED.  THE NEXT MORNING, THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT PULLED UP CODES PO202 AND P2149.  THE SERVICE MANAGER REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT IT WOULD BE SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE REPAIR PARTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE.    I LATER LEARNED THAT THE SERVICE BULLETIN IS #05-06-04-047C.  THE BULLETIN ADDRESSES \"A SEVERE REDUCTION IN ENGINE POWER (LIMP HOME MODE)\"    I WAS CHARGED $1,076 FOR REPAIRS FOR A KNOWN DEFECT THAT CHEVROLET KNEW ABOUT.",

MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO PATCH THE CORRODED BRAKE LINE IN THE PARKING LOT OF AUTO AT 8 PM AT NIGHT ONLY TO DISCOVER THE OTHER FRONT LINE WAS CRACKED AS WELL. BY THIS TIME IT WAS TOO LATE TO FIX SO WE MADE A HARROWING TRIP BACK TO OUR HOTEL WITHOUT ANY REAL BRAKES. GOOD THING THEIR WASN'T MUCH TRAFFIC AND WE WERE CLOSE TO OUR HOTEL. THE NEXT DAY WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP TO REPLACE THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE LINE.

GM IS USING COMPUTER CONTROLS WHICH OFTEN FAIL TO CONTROL IMPORTANT SAFETY FUNCTIONS OF THE VEHICLE.  I CURRENTLY HAVE THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLED THE BULK OF THE TRUCK TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER TWO DAYS IN THE SHOP, THEY STILL HAVE NOT FOUND THE PROBLEM.  FAULTY ENGINEERING AND POOR PARTS HAVE LEAD TO THIS CONDITION.  I HAVE BEEN A LIFELONG GM OWNER, BUT I WILL RECONSIDER THIS MOVING FOWARD.  I AM SURE MY NEXT VEHICLES WILL BE OTHER BRANDS.",

THE AIRLINES USE STAINLESS STEEL IN THE AIRCRAFT TO HELP RESIST CORROSION FOR THIS VERY REASON. WHY PUT PEOPLES LIVES IN DANGER WHEN YOU CAN FIX IT WITH BETTER QUALITY PARTS.",

I HAVE OWNED OTHER VEHICLES WHICH WERE MUCH OLDER AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE NOW.

AFTER LOOKING UNDERNEATH MY 2004 CHEVY SILVERADO 2500HD BRAKE FLUID WAS DRIPPING FROM A RUSTY BRAKE LINE BELOW THE DRIVER SEAT AREA. IT APPEARED I LOST THE REAR BRAKES SO I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TRUCK TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AUGUST 13, 2012. THIS TRUCK ONLY HAD 49,364 MILES ON IT AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 YEARS OLD. THE CHEVY DEALER LATER CALLED ME WITH THE BAD NEWS THAT ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES WERE BAD AND NEEDED REPLACED. THEY ALSO DISCOVERED THE FUEL LINES WERE RUSTY AND NEEDED REPLACED TOO. THEY LATER NOTIFIED ME THE CALIPERS WERE RUSTY AS THEY COULD NOT BLEED THE BRAKES PROPERLY SO THESE ALSO HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE TOTAL OF THIS AUGUST 21, 2012 INVOICE WAS $2,772.28 AND THIS WAS WITH A 10% DISCOUNT. PLEASE NOTE THE REAR BRAKES WERE JUST REPLACED 1207 MILES EARLIER ON APRIL 30, 2012 FOR MY REQUIRED STATE VEHICLE INSPECTION. DURING THIS STATE INSPECTION (MILEAGE 48,157) IN APRIL 2012 THEY ALSO HAD TO REPLACE A SPEED SENSOR AS THE TRUCK WAS GOING INTO ABS AT LOW SPEEDS. THE INVOICE STATES THIS SENSOR ?CAME APART? AND THEY ALSO HAD TO CLEAN THE OTHER ONE. THERE IS WAS NO INDICATION OF RUSTY BRAKE LINES OR FUEL LINES BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION DURING THE APRIL 2012 STATE INSPECTION AND ON AUGUST 11, 2012, JUST OVER THREE MONTHS LATER I EXPERIENCED TOTAL REAR BRAKE FAILURE. I CERTAINLY FEEL THIS WAS A SUDDEN LOSS AND COULD CERTAINLY LEAD TO FUTURE COLLISIONS, INJURY OR POTENTIALLY DEATH IF SOMETHING IS NOT DONE TO TRY TO CORRECT THIS BRAKE LINE CORROSION PROBLEM. I AM THANKFUL I WAS NOT TOWING A HEAVY TRAILER WHEN THIS OCCURRED AND THAT NO ONE GOT HURT BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. I?M GLAD THEY FOUND THE FUEL LINE PROBLEM AS THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A VEHICLE FIRE OR A HOUSE FIRE IF THE TRUCK WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE IF THIS FUEL LINE CORROSION WAS NOT CORRECTED.

HAVING VERY LITTLE TIME TO REACT, I NOTICED THE TRAFFIC IN THE ONCOMING LANE HAD STOPPED OR SLOWED GREATLY ABOUT 100 YARDS IN FRONT OF ME, SO I WAS ABLE TO SWERVE INTO THE LEFT LANE TO AVOID REAR ENDING AN ENTIRE LINE OF CARS WITH MY 6000LBS TRUCK. FORTUNATELY THE DRIVER AT THE FRONT OF THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC SAW ME AND STOPPED. I WAS THEN ABLE TO BARELY MANAGE MY WAY BACK INTO THE RIGHT LANE AS SOME OF THOSE CARS STARTED MOVING AGAIN. AT THIS POINT I WAS JUST CRESTING A LARGE HILL AT APPROXIMATELY 40MPH. A POLICE OFFICER IN THE ONCOMING LANE HAD ALREADY SEEN ME AND ACTIVATED HIS LIGHTS AND THEN STARTED WORKING TO TURN AROUND IN THE ROAD TO CHASE ME. WHEN I WAS BACK IN THE RIGHT LANE I FINALLY HAD A SECOND TO TRY TO LOCATE THE PARKING BRAKE, BUT ACTIVATING IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT. I COASTED NEARLY 1/2 MILE DOWN THE ROAD AND FORCED THE TRUCK INTO A PARKING LOT, OVER A LARGE SET OF RAILROAD TIES AND INTO A YARD WITH AN UPSLOPED HILL. IF I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN IT STOPPED THERE I COULD HAVE COASTED DOWN AN EVEN STEEPER HILL AND INTO A VERY BUSY MULTI-LANE INTERSECTION AND KILLED SOMEONE. THE POLICE OFFICER ENDED UP BEING UNDERSTANDING OF MY SITUATION AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK FOR ME AND I HAD IT TOWED TO A SHOP.

I BOUGHT A PIECE OF BRAKE LINE AND WAS GOING TO REPAIR IT THE NEXT DAY AND WHEN I GOT THE TRUCK ON THE LIFT I SEEN MASSIVE AMOUNT OF RUST ON ALL THE LINES AND THAT IT HAD MULTIPLE LEAKS FROM THE PANIC STOP.  I HAVEN'T SEEN LINES RUSTED LIKE THIS ON CARS THAT HAVE 3 TIMES THE MILEAGE THAT MY TRUCK HAS.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THAT IS A KNOWN CONCERN.  ALL BRAKE BLEEDERS ARE RUSTED BEYOND BEING ABLE TO BLEED THE SYSTEM, BACKING PLATES RUSTED AWAY.  OF ALL RECALLS OUT THERE AND THIS ISN'T ONE IS OUTRAGEOUS.  THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SOONER THAN LATER.  I HAVE BEEN A STATE INSPECTION MECHANIC ALL MY LIFE AND THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN ESPECIALLY ON A TRUCK WITH 60,000 MILES ON IT!  THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE??  PEOPLES LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND NO RECALL BUT WE WILL RECALL CARS IF A SENSOR MIGHT BE CAUSING A CAR TO POLLUTE THE AIR.  THIS IS A $1,000- $1,500 MIN. REPAIR FOR THE CONSUMER.  PLUS THE FUEL LINES ARE RUSTING THE SAME WAY.  I HAVE BEEN READING THE SAME COMPLAINTS ON LINE FOR HOURS TONIGHT AND I COULD READ FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND DON'T THINK I'D GET THROUGH ALL THE COMPLAINTS.  I'M TAKING MINE TO A DEALER TO HAVE IT FIXED JUST TO HAVE IT DOCUMENTED FOR ANY FUTURE RECALLS OR SETTLEMENTS OF THIS KNOWN ISSUE.  I'VE WORKED IN DEALERS ALL MY LIFE AND KNOW IT HAS TO BE DOCUMENTED PROPERLY TO GET REIMBURSED. I HOPE TO SEE SOMETHING DONE WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE NEXT PERSON GETS INJURED OR WORSE.  *TR",

I AM 65 YEARS OLD AND HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES OVER MY LIFETIME (INCLUDING CLASSIC CARS), BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD A BRAKE LINE RUST AS BAD AS THESE. I AM EXTREMELY LUCKY THAT I WASN'T ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY AND HAD TO MAKE A QUICK STOP FOR TRAFFIC AHEAD. MORE SERIOUSLY THAN THE RUSTED LINES IS THE FACT THAT NO PRIOR WARNING WAS GIVEN BEFORE TOTAL FAILURE. DUAL MASTER CYLINDERS AND ISOLATED FRONT AND REAR LINES DID NOT PERFORM AS DESIGNED. I HAVE BEEN ON THE INTERNET TODAY AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM. I CAN JUST IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE/FAMILIES WHO WILL NOT BE AS LUCKY AS ME IF THIS CONTINUES WITHOUT SOMETHING BEING DONE TO WARN AND CORRECT THE SITUATION. THIS SHOULD BE ON THE NEWS AND GM SHOULD BE INVOLVED AND RESOLVING THE ISSUE. THANKS  *TR",

THE NEXT TIME I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL, IT TRAVELED NEARLY TO THE FLOOR. THE LINE FROM THE ABS UNIT TO THE REAR BRAKES HAD CRACKED. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO MY GARAGE WHERE I REMOVED(AND SAVED) AND REPLACED THE LINE. SECOND INCIDENT: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19TH. ON MY WAY TO WORK, NORMAL DRIVING AND BRAKING, APPROACHING A TRAFFIC LIGHT, LIGHT CHANGED TO YELLOW, I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH, DEPRESSED BRAKE PEDAL, PEDAL CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AFTER THE LIGHT HAD TURNED RED. NO ACCIDENT OR INJURY. I WILL MOST LIKELY RECEIVE A TICKET AS THE LIGHT HAS A CAMERA THAT PHOTOGRAPHS ANYONE RUNNING THE LIGHT AND SENDS THEM A TICKET IN THE MAIL. THIS TIME, A LINE GOING TO THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT CALIPER BROKE. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY GARAGE WHERE I CUT OUT AND BEGAN THE DIFFICULT TASK OF REPLACING THIS LINE. I ALSO NOTICED THE LINE GOING TO THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT CALIPER WAS EQUALLY RUSTED, BUT HAD NOT BROKEN YET. IT IS NOW THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21ST. I HAVE MISSED 3 DAYS OF WORK AND NOW I WILL HAVE TO HAVE MY TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP I WORK AT WHERE I WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO REMOVE THE BODY OF THE TRUCK FROM THE FRAME TO PROPERLY INSTALL NEW BRAKE LINES TO THE FRONT CALIPERS. I HAVE SAVED THE OLD BRAKE LINES AS EVIDENCE. THEY LOOK MORE LIKE ROTTEN TWIGS THAN THEY LOOK LIKE STEEL BRAKE LINES. IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT A VEHICLE ONLY 9 YEARS OLD WOULD NEED ALL NEW BRAKE LINES WHEN I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OLD VEHICLES FROM THE 70'S AND 80'S WHICH HAD ORIGINAL BRAKE LINES THAT DID NOT BREAK. ONLY SURFACE RUST APPEARED ON THEM. *TR",

I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN AND AS I APPROACHED THE STOP LIGHT SUDDENLY THE BRAKE PEDAL COLLAPSED TO THE FLOOR CORRESPONDING WITH THE SERVICE BRAKE LIGHT TURNING ON. LUCKILY THE LIGHT CHANGED TO GREEN SO I WAS ABLE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. AFTER MAKING THE TURN I DROVE SLOWLY UNTIL IT WAS SAFE TO STOP AS THIS IS A VERY INDUSTRIAL AREA WITH NO PLACE TO STOP. I HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP THE VEHICLE, ONCE I WAS SAFE I EXAMINED THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND SAW FLUID DROPPING BELOW THE MASTER CYLINDER ONTO THE GROUND. WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER I FOUND A RUSTED BRAKE LINE RUPTURE ON THE FRONT PASSENGER BRAKE LINE DEPRESSURIZING THE SYSTEM. I LOOKED ONLINE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS AND HAVE FOUND A VERY COMMON ISSUE HERE AND REALIZED I SHOULD SHARE MY STORY. THE TRUCK IS NOT THAT OLD AND HAVING BEEN AN AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BRAKE LINES TO FAIL LIKE THIS REGARDLESS OF THE REGIONAL CLIMATES.

THEN JUST RECENTLY I EXPERIENCED THE SPEEDOMETER JUST STOP WORKING BY GETTING STUCK AT 30MPH. I PULLED OVER THE TRUCK AND TURNED IT OF TO MAYBE RESET THE SYSTEM BUT EVEN WITH THE TRUCKED TURNED OFF THE SPEEDOMETER WAS STILL AT 30MPH. I TRIED HITTING THE DASH A COUPLE OF TIMES TO SEE IF THAT WOULD WORK. IT DIDN'T WORK SO I TRIED DRIVING SOME MORE AND THE SPEEDOMETER SAID I WAS DOING 90MPH WHEN I WAS ONLY GOING 65MPH BECAUSE I HAD ANOTHER PERSON ON THE ROAD TELL ME THEY WERE GOING 65PMH. I EVEN TRIED TO HIT THE BRAKES MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THE NEEDLE TO DROP BELOW 30MPH. IT PARTICIALLY WORKED BY MAKING IT GO DOWN BUT THEN IT GOT STUCK AT 10MPH EVEN WITH THE TRUCK TURNED OFF. SO I CAME HOME AND CHECKED THE RECALLS FOR MY MODEL TRUCK AND YEAR AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT ONLY FOR VEHICLES UNDER 70000 MILES WHICH I THINK ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE ITS A FAILURE WITH YOUR ELECTRICAL CLUSTERS THAT YOU KNOW IS THERE BUT WONT FIX WHICH MAKES IT NOT LOOK GOOD FOR YOU DESIGNERS.

LATER THAT EVENING I WENT ON-LINE TO RESEARCH CHEVY TRUCK COMPLAINTS AND I FOUND THE BRAKE FAILURE I EXPERIENCED IS EPIDEMIC WITH 2000-2006 MODELS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THAT GM IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT-BLAMING IT ON SALT ETC..

MY TRUCK HAS OVERHEATED MORE THAN TWO DOZEN TIMES, AND ON SOME OCCASIONS LOST POWER, WHILE PULLING THE CAMPER UP LONG GRADES.  I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TWICE TO CHEVROLET DEALERS.  I HAVE THE SERVICE ORDERS THAT CLEARLY DESCRIBE MY OVERHEATING PROBLEM.  BOTH OF THESE SERVICE CALLS WERE WHILE THE TRUCK WAS UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THE DEALERS COULD NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  LATER WHEN THE TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, I FOUND OUT THAT GENERAL MOTORS RECOGNIZED THE OVERHEATING PROBLEM AND ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN #06-06-04-036D THAT DESCRIBES MY HEATING PROBLEM EXACTLY.  THIS SERVICE BULLETIN WAS ISSUED PRIOR TO EITHER OF MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT OVERHEATING.    THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING SERVICE BULLETIN #06-06-04-036D IS APPROXIMATELY $1,300 DOLLARS, SO GENERAL MOTORS RECOGNIZES THAT THIS SERIES TRUCK HAS A SIGNIFICANT OVERHEATING PROBLEM, BUT APPARENTLY THEY ARE HIDING THIS FIX FROM THE OWNERS UNTIL THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.    I CAN GIVE MANY INSTANCES WHERE THIS OVERHEATING PROBLEM HAS CAUSED A SAFETY PROBLEM.  ONE TIME I WAS PULLING THE CAMPER EAST ON INTERSTATE 40 ABOUT A 150 MILES WEST OF ALBUQUERQUE, NM WHEN THE TRUCK OVERHEATED AND LOST POWER.  THERE WAS NO GOOD PLACE TO PULL OVER AND I WAS TERRIFIED AS THE HEAVY TRAFFIC HAD TO CHANGE LANES AND PASS ME.  ANOTHER TIME I WAS PULLING UP TO THE NORTH RIM OF THE GRAND CANYON ON A TWO LANE ROAD WHEN THE TRUCK OVERHEATED, LOST POWER AND I HAD A LONG LINE OF TRAFFIC BEHIND ME.  IT WAS DANGEROUS AS THE TRAFFIC PASSED ME WITHOUT GOOD CLEARANCE.  I COULD GO ON AND ON OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS THAT CAUSED DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.    THERE IS ALSO A WEBSITE AT WWW.DIESELPLACE.COM THAT HAS AN ENTIRE SECTION DEVOTED TO THE LLY DIESEL.  THERE ARE OVER A THOUSAND POSTS CONCERNING THIS OVERHEATING PROBLEM.  *TR",

I GOT OUT AND NOTICED SOME OIL ON THE PAVEMENT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE BRAKE FLUID. I STOPPED AT AN AUTO PLACE AND BOUGHT A LARGE BOTTLE OF BRAKE FLUID TO FILL THE MASTER CYLINDER. I THEN STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AND COULD SEE THE FLUID SPEWING OUT OF ONE OF THE BRAKE LINES. THE BRAKE LINES ARE VERY BADLY CORRODED. I TOWED THE VEHICLE TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD MECHANIC AND HE INFORMED ME THAT ANOTHER CHEVY TRUCK WAS THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS NEAR MISS TRULY SCARED BOTH ME AND MY WIFE AND WE WERE BOTH GRATEFUL WE DIDN'T HAVE A SERIOUS CRASH. THE VEHICLE IS NOW AT A CHEVY DEALER FOR REPAIR AND THEY WILL BE STARTING THE WORK ON THURSDAY, APRIL 21ST. I DID CONTACT GM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, THEY HAVE CALLED ME TO ASK FOR THE DETAILS. I'VE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS CHEVY TRUCK VEHICLES WITH THE SAME CORRODED BRAKE LINES SO I DECIDED TO PUT IN A COMPLAINT. THE NHTSA HAS COMPLAINT #ODI 10358067 ALREADY IN IT'S DATABASE AND I SUSPECT MANY OTHERS BASED ON WHAT I SEE ONLINE. CHEVY BRAKES SYSTEMS HAVE 365 COMPLAINTS NOTED AT EDMUNDS.COM.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCALLY RESPECTED MECHANIC WITH THE INTENTION OF HAVING THE BROKEN BOLT REMOVED AND A NEW ONE INSTALLED.  I WAS NOTIFIED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE GM VEHICLES (2004 SILVERADO 2500HD).  I WAS FURTHER INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THE REPAIR WOULD BE SIMPLE DUE TO THE FACT THERE WAS NO PRACTICAL MANNER IN WHICH TO EXTRACT/DRILL OUT THE BROKEN BOLT FOR REPLACEMENT.  I WAS TOLD THE HEAD WOULD NEED TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE REQUIRED REPAIR WHICH WOULD COST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $700-$1000.  THIS REPAIR IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE TO ME FOR WHAT IS PROBABLY A $3.00 BOLT.  RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET I FOUND OUT IT IS IN FACT A PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES DATING BACK TO 1999.

OK NOT REALLY, BUT I'M JUST BESIDE MYSELF THAT GM WOULD DO SUCH A DUMB MOVE AND INSTALL A SAFETY FEATURE WHICH WOULD HINDER YOU IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.   MY 2004 SILVERADO HAS A \"SAFETY LATCH MECHANISM\" FOR THE SPARE TIRE THAT BECOMES RUSTED OR DIRTY AND WON'T ALLOW YOU TO GET THE TIRE DOWN!!  THEY SHOULD AT LEAST WARN PEOPLE TO CHECK IT AND SEE IF IT WILL LOWER AND TO GREASE IT OR PUT ANTI-SEIZING COMPOUND ON IT, SOMETHING.  THE DUMB THING SAYS PATENT PENDING ON IT! WHAT A JOKE!  THEY NEED A BETTER DESIGN AND RECALL!  I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE HAVING THEM BURNT OFF TO GET IT DOWN!  THAT IS WHAT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY WOULD DO FOR ABOUT $225 - CRAZY!   READ THIS AND MORE FROM OTHER DRIVERS ON THE INTERNET!!!!  THE WINCH PART NUMBER IS 15247311. THE PART COSTS AROUND $100. THERE IS DEFINITELY A CORROSION ISSUE WITH THE SECONDARY LATCH. BEST TO CHECK IT, CLEAN IT, GREASE IT, WHEN CHECKING AIR PRESSURE ON THE SPARE. SPARE TIRE WILL LIKELY DROP A COUPLE INCHES WHEN YOU UNCRANK THE WINCH. IF IT HANGS UP AT THAT POINT, THE SECONDARY LATCH IS NOT RELEASING. CONTINUING TO UNCRANK THE CABLE CAN TEAR UP THE WINCH, AS THE CABLE HAS NOWHERE TO GO. AFTER LOWERING THE TIRE A COUPLE INCHES, TRY SUPPORTING THE TIRE AND FORCING IT BACK UP. THIS MAY GIVE YOU ENOUGH ROOM TO FUSS WITH THE CRUSTY SECONDARY LATCH MECHANISM WITHOUT HAVING THE TIRE DROP ON YOU. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FREE IT UP AND THEN FURTHER LOWER IT TO CLEAN AND GREASE IT. IF ANYONE FROM GM READS THIS, YOU SHOULD NOT BE PROUD OF THIS LATCH. ANYONE FROM DETROIT SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR IS A CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN THIS DESIGN. THE TIGHTLY FITTING PARTS AND TINY SPRING CAN NOT WITHSTAND THE EXPOSURE TO DIRT, WATER, SALT, ETC... AND IT TURNS TO JUNK VERY QUICKLY. UPDATED 08/24/10. *LJ  UPDATED IVOQ 08/25/10*JB  *TR",

AT LEAST I THOUGHT  I WAS ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER I LOOKED DOWN AT THE SPEEDOMETER AND IT SAID I WAS GOING 30 MILES PER HOUR AND I MUST HAVE BEEN DOING 65-75. I SLOW DOWN TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SAFE SPEED BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO GET A TICKET OR CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. LATER WE STOPPED FOR GAS AND WHEN I RETURNED ON THE HIGHWAY I HAD NO READING AT ALL. I HAD 800 MORE MILE TO GO AND COULD NOT TELL HOW FAST I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE. AS WE MADE OUR WAY BACK HOME OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS THE SPEEDOMETER READ ANYWHERE FROM 70,40,25 OR NOTHING WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE.I CONTACTED THE CHEVY DEALER ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY WAS NOTHING CAN COULD DO SINCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRE.

WHILE WAITING FOR THE WORK TO BE COMPLETED I WAS ASK TO COME AND LOOK AT THE VEHICLE WHILE IT WAS ON THE LIFT. I WAS SHOWN THE FOUR BRAKE ROTORS (STILL ON THE VEHICLE). THE INSIDES OF THE BRAKE ROTORS WERE EXTREMELY DAMAGED WITH RUST, WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT. WHEN I EXPRESSED MY DISMAY AND DISGUST (THE VEHICLE ONLY HAD 28.5K MILES ON IT) I WAS TOLD THIS HAD OCCURRED \"BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WASN'T DRIVEN ENOUGH AND WE LIVE IN THE RUST BELT\". ANYWAY I AUTHORIZED THE WORK TO BE DONE, I NEEDED THE N.Y. STATE INSPECTION AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THE BRAKES WERE UNSAFE.  AFTER DWELLING ON THIS, I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND CAME TO FIND THAT THE BRAKE SYSTEMS IN MANY GM LIGHT TRUCKS HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND GIVEN SIMILAR RESPONSES VARYING SLIGHTLY TO FIT GM'S NEEDS TO MASK THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, THE MAJORITY BEING RUST AND CORROSION. IT IS OBVIOUS GM REMAINS IN DENIAL OF THIS DEFECT AND REFUSES TO CORRECT OR REIMBURSE FOR REPLACEMENT.  MY FIRST REGRET IS ALLOWING GM TO DO THE WORK. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, PREVIOUS VICTIMS THAT REPLACED THEIR ROTORS WITH GM PRODUCTS HAD THE SAME SUBSEQUENT RESULT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SUED. I WILL NEVER BUY A NEW GM VEHICLE AGAIN. IT IS NO WONDER THEY ARE GOING BANKRUPT. THEIR PROBLEM IS NOT THE PAY AND BENEFITS THEY GIVE THEIR WORKERS, IT IS WHERE THEY CUT CORNERS IN THEIR PRODUCT (CHEAP MATERIAL & OUTSOURCING) TO LINE THEIR CEO GREEDY POCKETS. THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY. *TR",

THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE TRUCK INTO A CHEVROLET DEALER FOR INSPECTION. IN DOING SO, THE DEALER REPLACED THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER ON MY TRUCK UNDER SOME SETTLEMENT THAT OTHER PARTIES HAD REACHED EARLIER WITH GENERAL MOTORS RESULTING IN EXTENDED SPECIAL COVERAGE.  ON THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUOUS \"BACKLASH\" IN THE DRIVE TRAIN HOWEVER, THE DEALER MERELY PROVIDED ME WITH A BULLETIN FROM GENERAL MOTORS STATING THAT THE \"CLUNK NOISE\" I WAS EXPERIENCING WAS IN THEIR WORDS \"A NORMAL CONDITION AND NO REPAIRS SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED.\"  THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS CONDITION CAN BE CONSIDERED \"NORMAL\" AND I FEEL THAT GENERAL MOTORS IS ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF A NOW KNOWN DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I FURTHER BELIEVE THIS DEFECT TO BE WIDE SPREAD AMONG THEIR TRUCK AND CAR MANUFACTURING LINES AND EXTENDING OVER SEVERAL MODEL YEARS OF VEHICLES. MY TRUCK HAS ONLY 19,000 MILES ON IT WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THIS PROBLEM AND I BELIEVE THAT IT CAN ONLY GET WORSE AS TIME GOES BY EVENTUALLY LEADING TO A COMPLETE FAILURE IN THE DRIVE LINE COMPONENTS OF MY TRUCK.

I DID A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE ALMOST 100 PEOPLE JUST ON THIS ONE SITE ( WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM ) HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH TRUCKS BUILT FROM 2002 AND 2006. THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND GM REFUSES TO DO A RECALL TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND THERE IS NO WAY TO PERMANENTLY FIX THESE TRUCKS WITHOUT DOING A RECALL AND CHANGING THE STEERING BOXES. THERE ARE PROBABLY  THOUSANDS OR MORE OF THESE TRUCKS OUT THERE ON THE HIGHWAYS.  I JUST PAID $11,000. FOR MY TRUCK AND PROBABLY WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO GET IT STATE INSPECTED WHEN IT COMES DUE. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THE WEBSITE THAT I GAVE YOU  WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW UPSET PEOPLE ARE WITH GM, AND RIGHTLY SO WHEN YOU PAY SO MUCH FOR A VEHICLE AND ARE AFRAID TO PUT YOUR FAMILY IN IT WITH CONCERN FOR THEIR SAFETY. DO WE HAVE ANY RECOURSE THROUGH THE LEMON LAWS IF THEY CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO RECALL THESE VEHICLES ? I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP ON THIS MATTER.  THANK YOU *TR",

INSPECTION INDICATED BRAKE PAD ON INNER RIGHT REAR WHEEL WAS WORN DOWN TO METAL AND WAS GROOVING INTO THE ROTOR. ADVISED TO DRIVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND BRING TRUCK THE NEXT DAY FOR REPAIRS. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT BACK AND HAD TO HAVE A ROTOR REPLACED AND ALL FOUR REAR BRAKE PADS, EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER THREE PADS STILL HAD 75% OF THE PADS LEFT ON THEM. TECHNICIANS WHO WORKED ON MY VEHICLE RECOGNIZED COMMON PROBLEM SEEN IN MANY 1500 CHEVY SILVERADO'S OF THIS AGE/ERA. TECHNICAL BULLETIN FROM CHEVROLET (00-05-23-005B, DATED MAY 27,2003) STATES PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL TRUCK INCLUDING YEAR MODELS 1999-2004. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM WAS TO INSTALL MUD FLAPS IN FRONT OF REAR TIRES TO PREVENT ROAD DEBRIS FROM BEING THROWN UP ONTO CALIPER ASSEMBLIES AND CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR TO THE RIGHT REAR INNER BRAKE PAD. WE PURCHASED THIS TRUCK IN DECEMBER OF 2003, WELL AFTER THIS BULLETIN WAS PUBLISHED AND THEY SOLD IT TO US WITH NO MUD FLAPS INSTALLED AND NO MENTION OF THE NEED FOR MUDFLAPS OR THAT THERE WAS A KNOWN DESIGN FLAW IN THE VEHICLE THAT COULD CAUSE REAR BRAKE DAMAGE. CHEVROLET SHOULD HAVE INSTALLED MUD FLAPS ON ALL AFFECTED TRUCK MODELS SOLD AFTER THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS FLAW. THEY DID NOT, NOR DID THEY LATER ISSUE A RECALL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. MUD FLAPS THEY RECOMMEND ARE NOT LONGER BEING MANUFACTURED BY THEM. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH CHEVROLET AND THEY HAVE REFUSED ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING THE MUD FLAPS (PART # 15765007) OR REIMBURSING US FOR THE BRAKE WORK THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN DONE, IF NOT FOR THIS KNOWN DESIGN FLAW IN OUR TRUCK. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF TRUCK OWNERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM AND PERHAPS DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE BULLETIN, AND ARE UNAWARE OF CHEVROLETS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DESIGN FLAW AND THE MUD FLAP SOLUTION.  *TR",

I GOT THE NEW BEARING AND STARTED TO DO THE REPAIR. I NOTICED THAT EVERYTHING LOOKED NEW YET, BUT THE BEARING WAS COMING APART. THE BEARING IS A SEALED UNIT-IT IS PRESSED TOGETHER.

AT TIMES NOW THE PEDAL GOES ALMOST ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND I AM AFRAID I AM GOING TO HIT SOMETHING.

I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM CHEVROLET EXTENDING THE WARRANTY, BUT OF COURSE EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION, IT IS STILL OUT OF WARRANTY.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. IF THE SPEEDOMETER IS READING 120 MPH WHILE SITTING STILL, HOW DO I KNOW THAT WHEN IT SAYS I AM DOING 55 MPH THAT I'M NOT ACTUALLY DOING 120 MPH.  THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART THAT GM MANUFACTURED.  LOOKING AT THE INTERNET, THIS AFFECTS PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE LARGE GM TRUCKS.  I WHEN TO CHECK THE COST FOR REPLACEMENT OF THIS PART AND THEY WANTED $450 JUST FOR A REFURBISHED CLUSTER.  THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM AND THE CORPORATION IS GIVING OUT DEFECTIVE PARTS WITH OUT REGARD TO THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE DRIVING THE VEHICLES OR ANYONE AROUND THEM.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SEGMENT LAST NIGHT IN REGARDS TO THE GM SPEED ODOMETER ISSUE. I HAVE A 2004 GM TRUCK AND HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BOTH THE TACHOMETER AND THE SPEEDOMETER. I CONTACTED MY LOCAL GM DEALER ABOUT A YEAR AGO ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY RECALL INFORMATION AND THEY TOLD ME NO. I JUST ASSUMED MY CASE WAS ISOLATED AND WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR OR LIVE WITH IT. THEN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GM STATING A KNOWN ISSUE WITH MY MODEL YEAR. BUT UNLESS MY TRUCK HAD LESS THAN 70,000 MILES IT WAS NOT COVERED.     I CAN NOT BELIEVE GM IS NOT WILLING TO ISSUE A RECALL OR THAT THE NHTSA DOES NOT VIEW THIS AS A SAFETY CONCERN. IN ALMOST EVERY AUTO COLLISION STORY OR STATISTIC I CAN FIND, IT NAMES SPEED AS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.     A POSSIBLE DIFFERENT ANGLE ON THIS TOPIC IS GM OWNER LOYALTY. THE PROBLEM AFFECTS 2003 AND 2004 MODEL YEARS. BASED ON 80% TO 90% OF ALL CARS ON THE ROAD ARE FINANCED AND MOST PEOPLE ONLY KEEP A VEHICLE 4 1/2 YEARS, THERE WILL BE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM THAT WILL BE LOOKING TO TRADE IN VERY SOON. IF MOST CONSUMERS ARE LIKE ME THEY WILL PERCEIVE THIS ISSUE AS VERY NEGATIVE TOWARD GM. IT SEAMS LIKE A VERY LARGE GAMBLE ON GM'S PART FOR SUCH AN INEXPENSIVE REPAIR. I KNOW WHEN I GO TO PURCHASE MY NEW TRUCK THIS COMING SPRING I WILL NOT BE LOOKING AT THE GM PRODUCTS.     THANKS, MICHAEL FULKERSON  *TR",

OTHER GAUGES ALSO DO NOT WORK.  THE OIL GAUGE DOES NOT REGISTER AND IS POINTING DOWNWARD.  THE FUEL GAUGE NOW DOES NOT WORK AND POINTS OFF THE SCALE.  I HAVE SEEN ON THE INTERNET MANY COMPLAINTS WITH SIMILAR ISSUES.  *JB",

NOW, ON DECEMBER 8, 2006, THE SPEEDOMETER STOP WORKING (61,000 MILES). DEALER STATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

FROM WHAT I'VE FOUND, THE SPEEDOMETER PROBLEM INVOLVES A \"STEPPER MOTOR\" NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR A PLASTIC COVERED GEAR THAT CRACKS, MAKING THE SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE MOVE ERRATICALLY. IF THIS SPEEDOMETER PROBLEM IS AS PREVALENT AS IT SEEMS, GM SHOULD BE FORCED TO OWN UP TO IT'S RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!

WOLD TOOK TRUCK FOR SERVICING AT RIVERSIDE AUTO CENTER IN BONNERS FERRY, IDAHO FOR INVESTIGATION OF THIS PROBLEM WITH NO SUCCESS. IN EARLY DECEMBER 2004, THE ABS LIGHT CONTINUED TO COME ON AND THE BRAKES WERE NOW NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BRAKES ON THE TRUCK FAILED, MR. WOLD WAS EXITING HIS DRIVEWAY.

THE SECOND TIME THAT THE BRAKES FAILED ON THE 2004 SILVERADO, THE SITUATION WAS A SERIOUS THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY. MR. WOLD WAS PULLING A FOUR (4) HORSE TRAILER AND COMING DOWN A HILL TOWARDS THE TOWN OF BONNERS FERRY. THE SPEED LIMIT ON THIS PARTICULAR GRADE DECREASES FROM 60 TO 45 AND THEN AGAIN, TO 35. AS MR.

AGAIN, MR. WOLD TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICING AND REPAIR.  THE LAST, FRIGHTENING EPISODE OF BRAKE FAILURE OCCURRED IN THE EVENING, AFTER MR. WOLD WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. AGAIN, AS HE DECELERATED AND LIGHTLY APPLIED HIS BRAKES WHILE COMING INTO TOWN, THE BRAKES WERE NON RESPONSIVE. AFTER THIS LAST EPISODE, MR.

THIS TRUCK IS VERY UNSAFE I CAN GO OVER EVEN THE SMALLEST BUMP AND FEEL THE FRONT END COME OFF THE GROUND. THIS TRUCK IS A VERY LIMITED EDITION. I EMAILED GM AND ASKED THEM IF IT WOULD BE OK TO LOWER MY TRUCK DOWN ON TO THE BUMP STOPS THEY TOLD ME THAT WOULD NOT BE RECOMMENDED FOR SAFETY REASONS! SO I ASK YOU WHY DID THERE FACTORY DO IT IF THEY KNOW IT IS UNSAFE. ONE LAST THING THIS TRUCK IS VERY HARD TO STOP IT DOZEN`T TRANSFER WEIGHT WHEN BRAKING. IT SURE IS A PRETTY TRUCK THOUGH JUST NOT SAFE. *AK",
