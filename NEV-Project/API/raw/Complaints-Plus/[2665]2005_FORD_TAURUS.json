AN INTERNET SEARCH OF THIS ISSUE SHOWS THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. AS I HAVE BEEN A MECHANIC SINCE 1973, I DECIDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE THROTTLE CABLE / CRUISE CONTROL CABLE TO SEE IF THESE TWO ISSUES WERE RELATED. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I DISCOVERED THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE WAS DECOUPLED FROM ITS POST MOUNT (SEE PICTURES). I HAVE SURMISED THAT THE DECOUPLED CABLE COULD BLOCK THE THROTTLE CABLE ROLL BACK TO THE IDLE STOP, AND IF THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS INITIATED, THE LOOSE CABLE COULD DRIVE FORWARD AND ARTICULATE THE THROTTLE FORWARD TO THE WIDE OPEN THROTTLE POSITION AS IT SEARCHES TO CONTROL THE DRIVE SPEED. AS BOTH THE THROTTLE ACTUATOR AND THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE INTERFACE ARE MADE OF PLASTIC, ONE OR BOTH HAVE WORN PAST THE POINT WHERE THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE WILL STAY SECURELY COUPLED TO ITS MOUNTING POST. WHY AREN'T BOTH OF THESE PARTS STEEL? WELL, PLASTIC IS CHEAP AND EASY TO MAKE. BUT PROFIT OVER SAFETY IS UNACCEPTABLE. NHTSA, PLEASE ADDRESS THIS.

THIS FIRST OCCURRED IN 2014 AND WE TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER. THEY EVALUATED THE CAR AND WORKED ON THE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY. I BELIEVE WE FILED A VEHICLE SAFETY COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA THEN.

HE WAS TOWED BY AAA TO A SERVICE CENTER. THEY ADVISED THAT THERE WAS SOME RESIDUAL CLOGGING AND BUILD-UP THAT WAS CAUSING THE THROTTLE TO GET STUCK OPEN. THEY CLEANED OUT THE THROTTLE AND SENT HIM ON HIS WAY. A FEW HOURS LATER, IT STARTED TO HAPPEN AGAIN IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC ON I-65 IN INDIANA DRIVING AT 70 MHP. HE WAS IN A PANIC AS TRAFFIC WAS SLOWING AHEAD OF HIM AND HE WAS STRUGGLING TO GET CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE OR TO SLOW DOWN. ESSENTIALLY, HE WAS CHARGING AT SLOWED TRAFFIC. HE WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER DANGEROUSLY THROUGH THE SLOWED TRAFFIC UNTIL HE GOT TO AN EXIT RAMP.

THIS TIME I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AGAIN AND PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL HARD TWICE AND THE ENGINE WHEN TO NORMAL.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT AND A SAFETY ISSUE.  I AM JUST HAPPY IT IS NOT WINTER SO I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF CONTROLLING THIS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE VEHICLE.  I AM CONCERNED THAT NOTHING WAS DONE INITIALLY AND EVEN IF I WANTED TO SELL THIS CAR I WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE TO EXPERIENCE THIS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PROBLEM.  I AM GETTING THIS REPAIRED AGAIN BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO RECALL.",

I RE-STARTED THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR WAS REEVING AT A HIGH RATE AND WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE IT SLAMMED INTO DRIVE AND THE CAR TOOK OFF. I FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG. THERE ARE NO \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHTS ON. IT FEELS LIKE THE CRUISE CONTROL IS ENGAGED, BUT I CONTINUOUSLY PUSHED THE \"OFF\" BUTTON ON CRUISE CONTROL AND NO LIGHT DISPLAYED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ENGAGED. I FEEL THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE MAKING OF THIS AUTOMOBILE AND I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. I AM FORCED NOT TO USE MY CAR UNTIL I CAN GET A MECHANIC TO LOOK IT OVER A DIAGNOSIS THE SITUATION. I HAD MY 93 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER TRAVELING WITH ME ON THIS DAY AND I AM FORTUNATE THAT I WAS NOT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.

IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED WHEN ACCELERATING UP TO 40 MPH, AND SUDDENLY THE SPEED INCREASED WITH THE RPM GOING UP TO 4,000.  THE GAS PEDAL WAS UNTOUCHED AND THE SPEED CONTINUED TO INCREASED.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY APPLIED THE BRAKES TO STOP BUT THE RPM REMAINED AT 4,000 RPM,   WHILE AT A STOP, THE DRIVER CHANGED THE DRIVE SHAFT TO NEUTRAL, AND THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO GO AT 4,000 RPM.  THIS WOULD GO ON FOR ABOUT 3-4 MILES, AND SUDDENLY GO BACK TO NORMAL MODE. THEN THE SYMPTOMS WOULD RETURN AGAIN UNEXPECTEDLY.    THIS BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE DECEMBER 5TH, AND IT IS WORSE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS ON THE FREEWAY.  THE SPEED CONTROL WOULD ALSO BECOME ERRATIC ONCE IT HITS 60 MPH.  THE DRIVER WOULD CHANGE SHIFT TO NEUTRAL OR TO D MODE JUST TO DISRUPT THE ERRATIC SPEED BEHAVIORS.   THE SYMPTOMS WOULD GO AWAY \"ON ITS OWN\".  IN ADDITION, I FOUND THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT OPERATIONAL AT THIS TIME .  THE CRUISE CONTROL CAN BE TURNED ON BUT THE CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT ENGAGED OR IS NOT HOLDING THE SPEED.   I HAVE DONE A THOROUGH CHECK ON THE ENGINE LOOKING FOR ANY DAMAGES, ANY  LEAKS IN THE INTAKE AIR PIPES,  OR FAULTY SENSORS AND FOUND NOTHING, BUT FROM RESOURCES, I LEARNED THAT IT MAY BE A FAULTY CRUISE CONTROL OPERATION.

FRIDAY SEPT 27TH ON MY WAY HOME I HAD ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION GOING OUT ON A MAJOR, VERY HEAVILY TRAVELED ROAD.  I PULLED AWAY FROM A STOP LIGHT AND WAS TRAVELING APPROX 35MPH WHEN THE CAR STOPPED \"PULLING\" AND THE ENGINE RPM'S REVVED PAST 6K.  THE CAR STOPPED PARTLY IN THE ROAD WHERE I HAD TO GET OUT ON THE TWO LANE ROAD AND PUSHED THE CAR THE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. (VERY DANGEROUS).  I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK AND GOT THE CAR BACK TO MY HOUSE.  WONDERING WHY THE TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT WITHOUT ANY WARNING, I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 FORD TAURUS TORQUE CONVERTERS WHERE THE PUMP SHAFT SPLINE IS ONLY .160 THICK, AND UNDER NORMAL USE, THE SPLINE WEARS EXCESSIVELY AND EVENTUALLY FAILS WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LOOSE ITS MOTIVE POWER.  NOW WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY HASN'T THE NHTSA INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE AFTER MORE RESEARCH AND SPEAKING WITH A FORD MASTER MECHANIC I FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM WITH THE FORD FREESTAR VEHICLES!!  WHY DID THE RECALL ONLY STOP WITH THE FREESTAR VEHICLE WHEN ITS THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE TAURUS?  IS IT GOING TO TAKE A WRECK WITH A FATALITY TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?  I UNDERSTAND WHEN PARTS FAIL BUT WHEN YOU READ ONLINE TO DIFFERENT FORUMS AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM OF THE 2005 TAURUS THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN WHICH SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE FORD ACCOUNTABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A SAME ISSUE WITH A DIFFERENT VEHICLE THAT HAS A RECALL.   EVEN THE MASTER TECHNICIAN SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY THE RECALL STOPPED WITH THE FREESTAR, IT'S THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 TAURUS, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.

IT APPROACHED SPEEDS OF OVER 55 MPH IN A 30 MPH ZONE.  LUCKILY THERE WAS NOT MUCH TRAFFIC AT THE TIME. SHE IMMEDIATELY APPLIED THE BRAKES AS HARD AS SHE COULD AND LUCKILY IS A STRONG GIRL AND WAS ABLE TO SLOW IT ENOUGH TO SOMEWHAT CONTROL IT AND BRING IT TO AN AREA WHERE SHE SHUT THE CAR OFF.  SHE STATES THAT \"IT FOUGHT HER HARD TO CONTINUE ACCELERATING AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL\". SHE CALLED MY HUSBAND AND I AND UPON ARRIVAL TO THE SITE, MY HUSBAND STARTED THE CAR.  IN PARK, IT RACED AS THOUGH THE PEDAL WAS TO THE FLOOR ALTHOUGH WE VERIFIED IT WAS IN FACT IN IT'S NORMAL POSITION WHEN NO PRESSURE IS APPLIED.

I WAS GOING 45 MPH WHEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT STARTED REVVING UP EVEN AS I APPLIED THE BRAKES. I HAD TO JUMP UP ONTO A MEDIAN AT 65ISH MPH TO AVOID OTHER CARS. THE BRAKES BEGAN TO SMOKE AND GRIND AS I TRIED TO STOP. I HAD TO APPLY THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP. EVEN STOPPED THE MOTOR CONTINUED TO REV AT 8000 RPM. I HAD TO TURN THE CAR OFF.     SINCE THEN THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION HAS OCCURRED FIVE MORE TIMES. I HAD TO TAKE IT IN FOR BRAKE REPAIRS AND THE MECHANIC SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS CAUSING THE ACCELERATION AND SUGGESTED I REMOVE MY FLOOR MATS AS THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN JAMMED UNDER THE PEDAL. WHILE I KNOW THIS TO BE FALSE I NONETHELESS REMOVED THE FLOOR MATS AND THE CONDITION REMAINS.     ANOTHER TERRIFYING INCIDENT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS VISITING MY DAUGHTER. SHE LIVES OFF A WINDY DIRT ROAD HIGH ON A LEAF COVERED RIDGE. I USUALLY DON?T GO ANY FASTER THAN 15 MPH ON HER ROAD. THE CAR EXPERIENCED ANOTHER SUDDEN ACCELERATION AS I WAS TURNING A BEND. THE CAR BEGAN TO SLIDE ON THE LEAVES AND I BOUNCED OFF A TREE STUMP AND ALMOST HIT MY DAUGHTER?S FIANC. AGAIN I APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP AND HAD TO TURN THE CAR OFF.     THE LAST OCCURRENCE HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY BEFORE I TOOK THE CAR OUT OF PARK. I HAD TO MASH DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR TO BRING IT BACK TO IDLE. AT THIS POINT I AM TOO AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR. I HAVE INCURRED REPLACEMENT BRAKE BILLS AND VARIOUS CAR DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF THESE INCIDENTS. THANKFULLY NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT.  *TR",

I ASSUME THAT THE CABLE WAS ABLE TO WEDGE THE THROTTLE OPEN AND BECAME UNSTUCK ONCE I DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL SEVERAL TIMES. THE PLASTIC END ON THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE IS NOT BROKEN BUT DOES FIT LOOSELY ON THE THROTTLE BODY WHEN I RECONNECTED IT. I HAVE APPLIED A PLASTIC ZIP TIE TO THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE TO KEEP IT FROM COMING OFF AGAIN.  *TR",

FOR THE MOST PART THE BRAKES WERE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR BUT AT A STOP LIGHT SHE HAD TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL TO REMAIN STATIONARY. AFTER SOME AMOUNT OF FIDDLING WITH THE GAS PEDDLE IT SEEMED TO COME UNSTUCK AND WORKED FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER WHICH IT BEHAVED STUCK AGAIN. OPENING THE HOOD SHE SAW THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAD COME DISCONNECTED AGAIN.    ON THE SECOND OCCURRENCE OF THE CABLE DETACHING OUR TODDLER HAD BEEN PLAYING IN THE DRIVERS SEAT WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED AND TRYING TO PUSH THE GAS PEDDLE WITH HER HANDS. MY BEST GUESS WAS THAT SHE HAD PULLED UP ON THE PEDDLE INSTEAD OF DOWN. TO CONFIRM MY SUSPICION I MADE SURE EVERYTHING WAS CONNECTED AND PULLED UP ON THE PEDDLE WITH MY FOOT, AS SOON AS I GAVE THE CAR GAS THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE CAME DISCONNECTED AGAIN. IT SEEMED REPEATABLE. I'M NOT SURE WHY PULLING ON THE PEDDLE MESSES THINGS UP OR HOW THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE AN ADULT WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING, BUT I SUPPOSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.    FOR THE FIRST OCCURRENCE I DON'T HAVE DETAILS BUT MY GIRLFRIEND, WHO OWNS THE CAR, SAID THAT IT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE WHEN IT HAPPENED THE SECOND TIME.

THE CAUSE OF THIS UNINTENDED ACCELERATION IS THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAS BECOME DISCONNECTED FROM THE THROTTLE LEAVER AND IS CATCHING ON THE THROTTLE LEAVER, SO THE LEVER CAN'T RETURN.  I TRIED TO RECONNECT THIS CABLE BUT THE PLASTIC RETAINER ON THIS CHEAP CABLE HAS BECOME DEFECTIVE AND WILL NOT RECONNECT. I HAVE NOW TIED THE CABLE BACK SO IT CAN NOT INTERFERE WITH THE THROTTLE LEVER.     I HAVE CONTACTED FORD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND ISSUED A COMPLAINT. THERE ARE NO RECALLS REGARDING THIS ISSUE. THIS PROBLEM IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND BEYOND THE SCOPE OF VEHICLE MAINTENANCE. THIS ISSUE COULD CAUSE A FATAL ACCIDENT TO AN UNSUSPECTING DRIVER.    I HAVE DOCUMENTED THIS ISSUE WITH PHOTOGRAPHS. PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A COPY OF THE PHOTO.   *TR",

THIS EVENTUALLY TURNED INTO THE THROTTLE STICKING OPEN AND NOT RETURNING TO IDLE. THE ON THE ROAD FIX WAS TO PUSH QUICKLY ON THE THROTTLE PEDAL A COUPLE TIMES TO GET THE THROTTLE TO RELEASE TO IDLE. THIS ALSO NECESSITATED RIDING THE BRAKES TO KEEP THE CARS SPEED UNDER CONTROL. OVER TIME THE ISSUE BECAME WORSE, WITH THE THROTTLE STICKING OPEN MORE OFTEN.    WHAT I FOUND WHEN INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE FITTING AT THE THROTTLE LINKAGE WAS DISCONNECTED. THE FITTING WOULD SNAP BACK ONTO THE PROPER PLACE BUT WAS VERY LOOSE AND WOULD POP BACK OFF EASILY WHEN THE THROTTLE WAS ACTUATED. I USED A PLASTIC TIE-WRAP TO TIGHTEN THE LOCKING MECHANISM IN PLACE.    ANOTHER ITEM THAT I FOUND WAS A LOT OF VARNISH WHERE THE THROTTLE BUTTERFLY MET THE THROTTLE BODY (INSIDE THE THROTTLE BODY) AT/NEAR IDLE. THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE STICKING CLOSED/OPEN ISSUE. I USED CARB CLEANER WHILE THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING TO CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY AROUND THE BUTTERFLY, AND OUTSIDE THE THROTTLE BODY ON THE LINKAGE. THE ISSUE AT THIS POINT HAS NOT RETURNED.    I DO FEEL THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CONNECTOR AT THE END OF THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE. SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE AFFECTING OTHERS ABOUT THE SAME MILEAGE, IT SEEMS TO BE A WEAR ISSUE OF AN UNDER DESIGNED CONNECTOR. I DON'T KNOW IF THE VARNISH BUILD UP (AMOUNT) IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY, BUT HAVE NOT HAD THE STICKING THROTTLE ISSUE ON ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED.     I COULD SEE THIS CAUSING AN ACCIDENT FOR OTHERS THAT MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.  *TR",

THEY ACKNOWLEDGE ISSUE, BUT SAY THERE'S NO RECALL.  THEY TOOK CONTACT INFORMATION, BUT WOULD NOT GIVE ME AN INCIDENT/CASE NUMBER BECAUSE \"OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN.\"  I CONTACTED TWO LOCAL DEALERS, WHO SAY THEY HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK (AT THEIR REGULAR SERVICE CHARGE OF $200-300).

WE WENT ONLINE TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT NUMEROUS CAR OWNERS HAVE  HAD THE SAME COMPLAINTS,  BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT ALL THESE YEARS,  ONE PERSON ONLINE RECOMMENDED DISCONNECTING THE CRUISE CONTROL BECAUSE IT WORKED FOR HIM.  WE IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECTED THE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION CEASED,  BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE CAR'S ENGINE GETS  A SUDDEN SURGE LIKE IT IS BEING \"REV VED UP\".

I TRIED TO PRESS ON THE BRAKE, AND IT DIDN'T WORK. MY CAR JUST KEPT GOING.  COMING TO A STOP LIGHT, I HAD TO POUND ON THE BRAKES, AND HOLD THEM DOWN EXTREMELY HARD - WHILE MY CAR WAS FIGHTING ME TO KEEP GOING.

I HAD TO STOMP ON MY GAS, AS IF I WAS REVVING MY ENGINE AND IT UNFROZE AND WENT BACK TO NORMAL. I DROVE BACK TO WORK THINKING I WAS GOING TO DIE!!! I WAS TERRIBLY AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, BUT IT WAS MY ONLY WAY TO GO TO AND FROM WORK. I'M JUST THANKFUL MICHIGAN HAD A VERY MILD WINTER, BECAUSE IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE SNOWY ROADS, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN OK. THE NEXT TIMES IT HAPPENED, I SHIFTED MY CAR INTO NEUTRAL WHILE DRIVING, AND SLAMMED ON MY GAS TO UNSTICK THE PROBLEM, BUT I AM EXTREMELY SCARED THAT THIS WONT ALWAYS WORK! I BROUGHT IT TO A MECHANIC, WHO TOLD ME IT WAS MOST LIKELY A THROTTLE ISSUE - THEN TALKED TO A WORKER AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP BY MY WORK AT A NETWORKING EVENT.

WHEN I STEPPED BACK ONTO THE GAS (GOING DOWN HILL NOW), I FELT THE CAR SHIFT INTO 4 GEAR. I THEN FELT, AND HEARD A POP SIMILAR TO A BLOWOUT, BUT IN REALITY IT WAS THE CAR SLIDING OUT OF GEAR. I HAD ONLY MANAGED TO REACH ABOUT 50MPH WHEN THE CAR STOP ACCELERATING, (I PUT ON MY HAZARDS) I WAS TRYING TO COAST TO A SAFE PLACE, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS MADE NO PLACE TO PULL OFF. WITHIN 5 SECONDS, A CAR TRAVELING BEHIND ME WAS BUMPED BY A TRACTOR TRAILER AND WAS KNOCKED INTO ME.    MY FORD MECHANIC SAYS THE TRANSMISSION IS SHOT AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WENT OUT (WAS THAT THE POPPING NOISE? I WONDER.) $3500 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE GOOGLE 05 TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS OVER 500 PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FORD WAS TRYING TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS, OR IF THEY WERE TRYING TO SAVE FUEL MILEAGE, BUT THIS TRANSMISSION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER FORD IF THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T GET RESOLVE BY FORD RECALLING THESE TRANSMISSIONS.       LAST LAUGH,  INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL REPAIR ANY CAR TO THE QUALITY IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE WRECK (NO BETTER, NO WORSE.).  SINCE MY TRANSMISSION WENT OUT BEFORE THE CAR WRECK, THEY CAN REPLACE IT,  ERGO...  THE INSURANCE COVERS THE BODY WORK, BUT WILL NOT COVER THE TRANSMISSION.

THEY OFFERED TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BY BREAKING DOWN THE TRANS AT A MINIMUM OF 10 HOURS LABOR AT $88.00 AN HOUR.  I CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR SOME ASSISTANCE AND WAS DENIED BECAUSE THEY HAD NO RECORD OF MY CAR EVER BEING REPAIRED AT ANY DEALERSHIP DURING THE LIFE OF MY LEASE. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH MY VEHICLE'S OPERATION PRIOR TO THE TRANSMISSION BEING FLUSHED, SO THERE WAS NO REASON TO TAKE IT IN FOR REPAIRS.

I TOOK MY CAR TO A LICENSED TRANSMISSION SHOP AND HAD THE TRANS REBUILT FOR $1,200.00  THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THE FAILED PART WAS A BOOST VALVE IN THE VALVE BODY.  THEY  REBUILT THE TORQUE CONVERTER AND INSTALLED A NEW OVERHAUL KIT AND THE BOOST VALVE.

THEY SAID THE SMELL IN THE VENTS WAS CAUSED BY A SMALL BUILD UP OF WATER IN THE AIR VENT RESERVOIR.  I HAVE ONLY 17,000 MILES ON MY 2005 TAURUS (WHICH I PURCHASED IN SEPTEMBER, 2006 WITH ONLY 247 MILES ON IT) BUT THE MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY JUST EXPIRED THIS MONTH.  I DO HAVE A 6 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND WAS TREATED VERY RUDELY BY THE SERVICE MANAGER.  HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $100.00 TO \"INVESTIGATE\" THE PROBLEM AND THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING IN MANY SABLE AND TAURUS CARS YET FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS PROBLEM.  IT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THESE FORD VEHICLES AND FORD SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND FIX IT AT THEIR COST.  HOW QUICK THEY ARE TO TAKE MY MONEY TO BUY THE CAR AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY YET THEY WILL NOT FIX NOR ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY THIS PROBLEM (WHICH THEY CREATED).
