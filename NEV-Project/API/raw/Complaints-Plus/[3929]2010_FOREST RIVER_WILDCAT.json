        "summary": "Two component issues on 2010 Forest River 31THSB 1 - Lippert axle hub brake drum failure. Multiple failures of these axles and Lippert have not issued a recall. My trailer lost the wheel from the axle, with the brake drum still attached to the wheel. Fortunately, we were not traveling at highway speed. Tire rolled underneath the trail causing damage to the side and underside of trailer. Lippert are aware of these constant axle failures and their solution is to sell you two axles for the price of one. 3-to-4-week delivery! Does not include the property damage, or take in account we where 3000 miles from home.  2 \u2013 Lippert frame and wing supports, where pin box is mounted to the frame of trailer, failed. Front and back welds on wings to main frame broke. Huge safety issue. Repairs to the failed frame and wing supports were completed at an RV dealership. The dealership and welder commented that the manufacture welds were poorly done. Lippert rep has heard of this happening to other Forest River RVs but very few, but does happen! Fortunately no one was injured.  Just what you want to be doing while on vacation.",
