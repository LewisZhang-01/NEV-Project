THE VALVE INSIDE THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIVATION OF THE ABS FAILS TO CLOSE COMPLETELY CAUSING FLUID BYPASS AND NO BRAKE PRESSURE RESULTING IN THE PEDAL FALLING TO THE FLOOR. AFTER SOME TIME, THE PEDAL RETURNS TO NORMAL FUNCTION AND THE HCU VALVE SEEMINGLY SEALS BE IT THE SAME DRIVE, OR A COUPLE DRIVES . THIS OCCURS AT RANDOM, ONLY WHEN THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF BRAKE PRESSURE AND ROUGH ROAD CONDITIONS COMBINE FOR THE ABS TO ACTIVATE. HOWEVER, THE BREAKS DO NOT RETURN IMMEDIATELY, SO YOU ARE FORCED TO DRIVE WITH VIRTUALLY NO BRAKES TILL IT FINALLY RESOLVES ON ITS OWN. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN STORMS, WHERE I HAD TO STOP HARD DUE TO DEBRIS IN THE ROAD. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN EXITING A HIGHWAY AND THE EXIT RAMP IS MILLED, SO WHEN YOU ARE BREAKING AND HIT THE GROOVED SECTION THE BRAKES DISAPPEAR. THIS ALSO OCCURS IF YOU HIT A ROUGH PATCH OF ROAD OR POTHOLE WHILE BREAKING. THIS IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS, WITH THE ROOT CAUSE BEING A DEFECTIVE VALVE DESIGN IN THE HCU AND IS A COMMON ISSUE ACROSS THE FORD LINEUP. THE ISSUE IS THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, HARD TO DIAGNOSE, AND ALWAYS MISDIAGNOSED AS AIR IN THE SYSTEM. THE ROOT CAUSE IS A FAULTY HCU CAUSING A VALVE TO FAIL TO SEAT PROPERLY AND ALLOW PRESSURE BLOWBY. THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT PREDICTABLE, AND IT DOES NOT RECOVER UNTIL SOME TIME HAS PASSED. SO IMAGINE A FOCUS EXITING THE HIGHWAY AND LOSING THE BRAKES UNEXPECTEDLY AND FOR THE REST OF THE DRIVE - THAT IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. NO INDICATION OF ANYTHING ABNORMAL IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, NO LIGHTS. THIS HAPPENED AGAIN THE OTHER DAY AND IT HAS YET TO RESET ITSELF - FORD NEEDS TO FIX IT!!

MY TIRES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR 45,000 MILES OR MORE, DEPENDING ON WHAT I BUY, AND NO MATTER WHAT BRAND I BUY, NONE HAVE LASTED 20,000 MILES.

I REFUSE TO SPEND MONEY REPLACING PARTS TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM BY \"PROCESS OF ELIMINATION\" BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS.

AFTER REPLACING THE PCM AT A FORD DEALERSHIP THE SECOND TIME MY CAR STALLED OUT ON ME THE NEXT DAY.  THE PCM CODE WAS THE SAME AT EACH LOCATION (CODE P00607).  BOTH PCM'S WERE PURCHASED FROM FORD BRAND NEW.    I AM NOW BEING TOLD BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP THAT THE FOLLOWING CODE (P0320) WAS OBTAINED.  THEY INDICATED THE FOLLOWING WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE AMOUNT OF $575.00: THE COST OF THE REPAIRS INCLUDE: TUNE UP  IS $260.00 THIS INCLUDES SPARK PLUGS ,SPARK PLUG BOOTS, AND  2 IGNITION COILS AND THE LABOR TO INSTALL THEM.  THE COST TO REPLACED THE VALVE COVER GASKET THAT IS LEAKING OIL INTO THE SPARK PLUG VALLEYS IS $315.00  THIS INCLUDES THE PARTS AND LABOR. (SPARK PLUG VALLEYS #3 AND #4 HAVE OIL IN THEM.)    MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS WAS NEVER A PCM ISSUE; HOWEVER, IT IS SOMETHING ELSE FEEDING MISINFORMATION TO THE PCM TO SEND INACCURATE CODES TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  THE PROBABILITY OF THREE PCM'S BEING FAULTY IN 1 YEAR IS NOT LIKELY.    THIS VEHICLE HAS STALLED IN TRAFFIC ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION AND IS A RISK TO OTHERS AND MYSELF ON THE ROADS.  I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OF THE 2008 FORD FOCUS SE.  FORD NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE AND CORRECT THIS SAFETY ISSUE.",

WHEN I PICKED THE CAR UP THEY BASICALLY SAID THERE'S NOT MUCH THEY COULD DO AND THAT THE STEERING IS STILL ROUGH BUT NOT AS BAD SINCE THEY TOOK OUT THE OLD RACK SUSPENSION AND SUPPOSEDLY REPLACED IT WITH A NEW ONE, THEY DID NOT CHARGE US FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID SO WE DIDN'T RECEIVE A RECEIPT AND THEY ONLY SHOWED US THE OLD RACK SUSPENSION THAT THEY TOOK OUT.

TODAY, HOT SUMMER DAY, I WENT SHOPPING WITH MY BOYFRIEND, HE SAID I'M GOING TO GO GET YOUR CAR I WILL BE BACK, AS 30 MINUTES PASS HE IS FINALLY BACK TO TELL ME THAT MY DOOR WILL NOT UNLOCK. THE KEY WOULD NOT UNLUCK THE DOOR. I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE BACK DOORS JUST BEING STUCK ON LOCK FOR DAYS AT A TIME BUT IT ALWAYS EVENTUALLY FIXES ITSELF, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE NEVER REPORTED IT BEFORE. BUT TODAY I HAD TO PAY 30 DOLLARS FOR A LOCKSMITH TO COME OUT AND UNLOCK MY DOOR. I AM NOT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE I AM A POOR COLLEGE KID WHO COULD REALLY USE THAT MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE. AS I RESEARCH THIS ONLINE I SEE MORE THAN ENOUGH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENING TO PEOPLE WITH THE SAME CAR THAT I HAVE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS IF FOR SOME REASON THERE WAS A KID IN THE CAR THAT WE COULD NOT GET OUT. IT INFURIATES ME THAT NO ONE WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I THINK IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT THIS PROBLEM BE INVESTIGATED AND IF NECESSARY THE CARS BE ON RECALL TO GET FIXED FOR FREE. THANK YOU.  *TR",
