The power steering warning light appeared after the wheel stiffened. I took my car to a local Auto Zone and she tightened some screws and my steering wheel mysterious loosened.

While my husband was driving the vehicle at highway speeds, he indicated the steering wheel suddenly wanted to turn to the left on it's own. I drove the vehicle the next day and really did not notice an issue.  However, my adult daughter drove the vehicle the following day and after driving the vehicle a short distance had to return home because the steering suddenly became very difficult to turn to the right, but super loose when turning to the left to the point it was almost impossible to control.  I drove the vehicle for myself and found the same, plus the steering was extremely jerky, not at all smooth as it once was.    The vehicle is in the repair shop now with an independent mechanic we trust 100%.  He lifted the vehicle and was shocked at how the steering is reacting, advising the vehicle is definitely not safe to drive in it's present state.  His extensive research, coupled with the codes presented, leads him to believe the rack and pinion needs replacement.  Unfortunately, the repair cost is quite high due to the parts cost and labor involved.    After reading all of the reports online about this exact same complaint from other consumers, I am disturbed that Honda has not done a recall.  If so many of these vehicles are having this exact same issue, and it is a very strong safety hazard, why is this not considered an incident that requires recall?  And how can I be assured that the Honda replacement parts are not going to fail in the future for the exact same reason?  Do I now have a vehicle that is unsafe and I will constantly worry the steering is going to fail? I live in a rural area and hate to think that at any time the steering could fail and my car and it's occupants could end up in a ravine or body of water.

My local Honda dealership did let me know that this recall was issued only for vehicles sold in the Midwest because they are more susceptible to rust and corrosion. I originally purchased the vehicle in Florida (I'm the original owner) in October of 2012. I moved to Iowa in 2015 and am now experiencing the same problems as the safety recall in question.  I've had my vehicle inspected by my local Honda dealership in Des Moines IA and they have confirmed that I'm showing the same symptoms as the recall that require a complete CV axle replacement. Because my VIN number was not included in this recall, they are unable to perform any repairs. I've called Honda of America and because of my VIN, they also refuse to even look at my case even though I now live in an area that uses a high volume of salt on the roads during the wintertime.  I believe that I am not the only one and others could be at risk if they also moved to an area with a high volume of salt on the roads.

There have been multiple occasions when it takes a great deal of effort (physically) to control the vehicle--almost as if there is a loss of power steering. Conversely, the steering wheel almost spins freely--requiring extra motion to steer the car and making it difficult to control. Of most concern is that the malfunctions occur without warning\u2014resulting in the car drifting toward the adjacent lane on several occasions. Fortunately, I was able to make the correction in time--preventing the car from crossing into the next lane and possibly causing a collision. The local dealer checked the steering on May 20, 2021. At that time, the steering wheel was returning to the home position on its own\u2014while I was driving the car and attempting to turn. The dealer did a diagnostic, performed a sensor re-learn and several other procedures. After exhausting all options, they contacted the Tech Line to inform them that the car was still difficult to turn during the road test. The Tech Line responded that this can be caused by hitting the curb and other driver-related mishaps. Although the adjustments made at the dealership improved the condition, it was clear that the manufacturer didn't provide the support required to resolve the problem. The steering worsened last week to the extent where I felt unsafe driving the vehicle. I took it to a different repair shop, it was inspected, and they recommended that it not be driven until repaired. After doing some research, it was clear that this is an on-going problem that has yet to be corrected by Honda. Currently, the car is parked and I have no transportation.",

The vehicle has been checked out by my mechanic numerous times but the issue has never been remedied. The alternator (replaced twice), electronic load detector, battery sensor and battery sensor connector have all been replaced. Wiring has also been inspected but there were no problems to report.  A check charge system warning stays on, and sometimes the battery light illuminates.

It startled her as she was driving in traffic when it suddenly pulled left into another lane.  She was able to keep control of the car and brought it straight home.  I verified that when my car ignition was turned on, the steering wheel will turn to the left by itself... spinning several times counterclockwise.  I also confirmed that there are no EPS error codes or warning lamps shown which seems strange there are no OBD codes.   We called the local Honda dealer and they stated there is an issue with the EPS and we could bring in our vehicle for repair.  I took my vehicle to the local Honda dealership for the repair of this EPS defect which they originally stated would be fixed free of charge.  The dealership confirmed the defect condition on my vehicle and performed the Honda prescribed repair of reprogramming the EPS ECU.  However, this did not fix the concern on my vehicle but only lessened the EPS steering force.  The dealership contacted Honda directly to request a full replacement of the EPS rack on my vehicle.  After about a week of delay, Honda responded and stated that since my vehicle is more than 5 years old, they are  declining to replace the steering rack at their cost. They have quoted to me a repair cost of $2,900.  This is evidently a mfg defect with the EPS rack system and creates an unsafe driving condition due to steering control.  This EPS concern needs further investigation and a recall seems necessary as Honda is only following a programming change which does not resolve all concerns as mine still exists on my vehicle.  So now when driving my vehicle, you cannot remove your hand from the steering wheel, or it will steer itself continuously left.  Again I feel the vehicle steering system is a critical function and Honda should repair at their cost.",

I called my local shop to see if I could take it by there Friday morning and they couldn't accommodate due to the busy Labor Day weekend. So I called the Honda Dealer (Right Honda) in North Scottsdale and was able to schedule a visit for 7:30am on 9/4. I drove my car home on 9/3 and by the time I made it home, the power steering had come back but the light was still on. The morning of 9/4 I get in my Accord to take it to Right Honda... the power steering light was not on anymore and the car was steering fine. Right Honda told me they can't do anything for me since the light wasn't on anymore... that weekend, 9/5, my light comes back on while I'm away from town and I have to drive it back home without power steering, which felt kind of dangerous. I scheduled a time to take it in for service on 9/7 at my local service center, not Right Honda. It is now 9/20 and I'm being told the part I need is on a national shortage. We've been waiting for almost two weeks now and I'm curious how/why this part can be allowed to be on national shortage when it's a defect of Honda's? I've seen there's plenty reports (100+) of the electronic power steering failing in 2013-2015 Honda Accords and I'm surprised they have the replacement part on a national shortage. This is disappointing as a loyal Honda customer.",

If I drive straight the car seems fine. None of the dash lights have turned on. The dealer said to replace the steering rack. However, they can't even get the part due to the computer chip shortage. They said it is on back order and the earliest they could get it is in 6 weeks. Their estimate was around $2,700.

Tested car on cul de sac by my house and the steering wheel fights to go straight and pulls hard to the left resulting in immediate left hand turn.  When trying to drive, the steering fights to go in any other direction than left and if and you do not have a tight grip, the car will turn left.Took Honda to my independent car repair on June 11.  He was able to replicate the issue & told me it was the EPS and should be covered by Honda on extended warranty from a Federal Recall.  Appointment made for June 16 at Coggin Honda Orlando and was car towed there on June 15, 2021.  June 16, Honda called and said the EPS and outer tire rods were broken. The parts were the parts included in the recall and extended warranty but the car was not showing trouble codes 5301 or 5302 so car was not covered, and they would have to charge me $2,730.25 for the repair.  In fact, car was showing absolutely no trouble codes or potential coeds of any kind.  Service advisor Gus Ramirez & his boss Fadi Alzeideh both agree the part that is covered under the warranty is the part the needs replaced but their hands were tired due to no 5301 or 02 codes.  Case started with Honda Corporate on June 17, 2021. Case number 12296417.  It shouldn't matter if there are trouble codes. The steering issue wasn't fixed during the initial recall in 2015 and should be covered now.

Luckily had both hands on the wheel and steering worked enough to pull left before I ran off road.  Frankly, I am afraid to drive it.  Took the car to local dealer yesterday. They ran diagnostics and test drove but found no issues with steering. I advised that I could not retrieve the vehicle late yesterday but would do so this morning.  Several hours after that conversation, having heard that they found nothing wrong, the same rep called me and said \"you can't drive this car\".  He relayed that technician was moving the car from the bay to the lot when the car took a hard right and nearly collided with another car parked in their lot. The tech brought the car back to the shop and up on the rack where they observed the car again make a hard right turn. No one was behind the wheel when this occurred.  I just rcvd an estimate for repair ~ $3,700.00.  Electronic power steering rack assembly accounts for $3,140.00 of this cost. Alignment & some other diagnostic costs take it up from there.",

I have complained to honda that this is not normal. There are no leaks whatsoever. To prevent engine damage, I have to fill in a quart of engine oil for every 1500 miles of driving. I have owned several honda's and never once had any issues like this. I even changed the pcv valve and that did not fix the issue. Honda knows about the excessive oil consumption and refused to issue a recall to replace the piston rings. Almost every 9th generation Honda Accord owner faces premature starter failure and excessive oil consumption. This is not normal and Honda is avoiding this issue and give customers like me the run around to perform compression test etc and adding engine oil for every 1000 miles of driving is normal. I have never heard of such thing unless you drive a high performance vehicle. I hope NHTSA will investigate and force Honda to issue a recall and compensate owners who had to pay out of pocket for premature starter failures.",

We took it back to our local Honda again and I called the corporation, again Honda said they can only fix this safety issue with payment. We then took the vehicle to a reputable mechanic in town and they too agreed that this issue should be covered by Honda. Our Mechanic outreached to our local Honda AGAIN and a Honda 30miles away and both said they cannot do anything without payment. We were shocked by how Honda clearly knew about the safety issue and concern but still would not do anything without payment and clearly the extended warranty impacted the steering. We had no choice but to pay for the repairs. The day we got the car back from being repaired ($3,772.35 later) we see that NHTSA opened an investigation for a safety recall on the steering!

For example, while making a left-hand turn, the steering wheel can, without warning, jerk back to the right. While this has primarily occurred at lower speeds, it has been severe enough that it has almost caused us to not make our turn and as a result nearly run off the road, or into a curb or into vehicle next to us (pulling into a parking spot). To be honest, only good luck can be credited for the fact we haven't gotten into an accident up to this point. As stated before, this issue primarily occurs at slower speeds (< 30 mph), and while we've been fortunate enough that we've been able to recover from the momentary loss of control, if this issue were to occur at higher speeds or in a traffic-dense area, there is a very real possibility of a serious accident occurring. None of the vehicle's warning lights have ever indicated that there is an issue with the power steering system. Out of concern, the car was taken to a Honda dealership where they were able to reproduce the issue and recommended replacement of the entire steering rack and control unit at a cost of several thousand dollars. As we believe that the rack and/or it's control unit have a design flaw that would also still be present in a brand new non-revised rack, we have elected not to replace the rack in hopes of Honda taking ownership of it's defective product and offering a real solution to those of us who are affected by this problem. The vehicle still has the original steering rack and can be made available to the NHTSA to demonstrate the abnormal steering behavior.",

I have taken the vehicle to the authorized Honda dealer in my city and was told that it was an \"alignment\" issue. Funny thing is, I went ahead and got an alignment when purchasing new tires a few weeks later and on my way home the issue happened numerous times (with videos to prove it) and continues to happen to this day.   My vehicle gave no warning or messages prior to the issue happening.   This has been an ongoing issue for close to two years now so I'm very happy to see that the news that this is an issue that the NHTSA is probing.

They reset the error codes and examined everything. Upon leaving the dealer repair depot the steering pulled very hard to the  left. I returned and complained. The manager helped out and contacted Honda Factory support. A 4 wheel alignment was performed and adjusted to factory specs. The electronic steering system was fully reset and reprogrammed. This seemed to fix the problem. About 1 month later the steering system began to act erratically and continues to do so. Sometimes when turning a corner the steering system pulls in the direction of the turn, right or left. Sometimes it acts normally. All oddities seem to related to accelleration and braking. When driving in a straight line there is no deviation left or right however it is always harder to turn the wheel left than right.",

THE NEXT TIME AAA DETERMINED THAT THE BATTERY WAS FINE BUT THE CAR REACTED WITH A FAST CLICKING SOUND. PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD NOT WORK AND THE GEAR SHIFT WOULD NOT MOVE OUT OF PARK. THE THIRD TIME WE LEFT THE CAR FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND THEN IT STARTED.  EACH TIME THE CAR WAS LEFT IN THE ON POSITION, IN ONE CASE CHARGING A CELLPHONE, IN ANOTHER CASE LISTENING TO THE RADIO.  IN THE PAST I HAVE NOTICED THE SMART ENTRY SYSTEM LIGHT COME ON AND OFF BUT WAS TOLD IN ONE CASE (BY A HONDA SERVICE REP!) THAT THEY COULD NOT DETECT A PROBLEM AND NOI CODE WAS REGISTERED.  THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT IN WHEN THE LIGHT WAS ON BUT IT IS INTERMITTENT.  I WAS WONDERING IF THERE COULD BE INTERFERENCE FROM MY OTHER CAR'S REMOTE KEY OR MY CELL PHONE SO I HAVE BEEN MOVING THOSE TO THE BACK OF THE ACCORD.   I HAVE ATTACHED SCREEN SHOTS FROM THE WARNING LIGHT AND TWO WEBSITES/BLOGS WITH MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE RELEVANT.

THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY SO I TOOK IT TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP IN BOONE, NC.  THIS LEAVES ME WITHOUT A CAR TO DRIVE AND NO ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION IN MY SMALL RURAL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS  UNABLE TO PULL A DIAGNOSTIC CODE FROM THE COMPUTER.  THEY USED A DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLESHOOTING TREE AND FOUND IT TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE POWER STEERING RACK AND THE REPAIR WOULD BE NEARLY $3K.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMER FOR 25 YEARS AND EXPECT BETTER.   THIS APPEARS TO BE A WIDESPREAD ISSUE THAT ISN'T BEING ADDRESSED BY THE COMPANY.   THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF REPORTS THAT I HAVE SEEN ONLINE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE SO IT IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING FLAW THAT NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED BY HONDA.  I AM AN ELDERLY WIDOW AND NEED RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION.  I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO REPAIR THIS CAR AND NEED ASSISTANCE FROM HONDA AND THE NHTSA TO HELP GET THIS RESOLVED.   THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND URGENT ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER FOR ME AND THE MANY MANY MANY OTHERS FACING THIS SAME FAILURE IN THE 2013 ACCORD.  PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING.

WHILE TRAVELING AT 50MPH ON A CROWDED CITY HIGHWAY, MY STEERING WHEEL JERKED LEFT AND I COULD HAVE HIT THE CAR IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME. THE PROBLEM PRESENTED AT INTERMITTENT TIMES OCCURRING LATER IN A TRIP.  I DID AN EXPERIMENT IN A PARKING LOT; ROLLING FORWARD VERY SLOWLY, I LET GO OF THE STEERING WHEEL. THE STEERING WHEEL SPUN TO THE LEFT AND THE CAR EXECUTED A PERFECT 90-DEGREE LEFT TURN BY ITSELF. THE CAR DID THIS AGAIN TWICE MORE DESPITE TURNING THE ENGINE OFF FOR A PERIOD BEFORE TURNING IT BACK ON. I TOOK IT BACK TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO COULD FIND NO ERROR CODE BUT COULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER RESETTING THE TORQUE SENSOR, IT WAS A BIT BETTER BUT NOT FIXED AS THE CAR STILL WANTS TO TURN LEFT. THE STEERING IS ERRATIC SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO TURN RIGHT AND SOMETIMES THE STEERING FEELS LOOSE. MY LOCAL MECHANIC SENT ME TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR WHO SUGGESTED I TAKE IT TO A HONDA DEALER.  THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT ALSO REPLICATED THE PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT FIX IT BECAUSE THE CAR DID NOT SHOW ANY ERROR CODES AND HONDA WILL ONLY REIMBURSE THEM IF THE CAR SHOWS TWO SPECIFIC ERROR CODES. I FOLLOWED THEIR SUGGESTION TO CALL HONDA; [XXX].  THE REGIONAL CASE MANAGER CALLED ME BACK, DID NOT ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PROBLEM BUT RUDELY LAUNCHED INTO A RAPID-FIRE LECTURE ABOUT WHY HONDA WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THIS PROBLEM IN MY CAR.

MY CAR ONLY HAS ABOUT 42,000 MILES ON IT AND THAT WAS THE TIME OF THEM GOING OUT ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.  CARS EFFECTED WERE 2013-2017 HONDA ACCORDS EX. MINE IS THAT AND A V6. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRASHED & DIED WITH THIS FAULTY PART? DO YOU HAVE RECORD OF IT? I WANT THIS ELECTRIAL POWER STEERING PART RECALLED!!  YOU HAVE FAILED WITH NOT RECALLING IT BACK IN 2014!!  I AM HOLDING \"YOU\" ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS HAPPENING TO ME!!  I WANT YOU TO PAY FOR MY CAR TO BE FIXED AND MY RENTAL CAR!  I NEED YOU TO RESPOND TO ME  [XXX]  [XXX] IS MY CELL.  YOU ARE LUCKY I DIDN'T CRASH!!   MY CAR IS SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY IN SEASIDE, OREGON AND I NEED IT TOWED TO BEAVERTON, OREGON TO GET IT FIXED. I HAVE POSTED THE 2014 ARTICLE OF YOU NOT RECALLING THIS!  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

THIS TYPE OF STARTER USES A SOLENOID TO MOVE THE STARTER MOTOR'S PINION GEAR FORWARD TO MESH WITH THE FLYWHEEL'S RING GEAR WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PULLING THE PLUNGER AND ITS COPPER CONTACT DISC ONTO THE BATTERY CONTACT AND THE STARTER MOTOR CONTACT TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE STARTER MOTOR.  WHEN FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, TURNING THE IGNITION KEY OR STARTER BUTTON SHOULD MESH STARTER'S PINION GEAR WITH THE FLYWHEEL AND TURN THE STARTER MOTOR TO CRANK THE ENGINE.      THE PROBLEM WITH THESE STARTERS IS THAT THE BATTERY-SIDE CONTACT AND THE BATTERY-SIDE OF THE PLUNGER CONTACT ERODE EXCESSIVELY DUE TO ARCING AND CONSEQUENT PITTING.  THIS INTERMITTENTLY PREVENTS THE PLUNGER'S CONTACT FROM CONTACTING THE BATTERY-SIDE CONTACT TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE BATTERY AND STARTER MOTOR.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE PINION GEAR MESHES WITH THE FLYWHEEL BUT THE STARTER MOTOR DOESN'T TURN.  NOTE THAT THE PINION GEAR ENGAGING AND DISENGAGING THE FLYWHEEL IS THE CLICKING SOUND HEARD FROM UNDER THE CAR DURING A FAILED START.    THIS PROBLEM WAS FIXED BY REPLACING THE CONTACTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN HONDA BRUSH HOLDER (HONDA PART NUMBER: 31210-5A2-A01) WHICH COST ME $45 AT MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER.

SOMETIMES, MY CAR STARTS RIGHT AWAY.  BUT MORE OFTEN, IT TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BEFORE MY CAR WILL START USING THE PUSH BUTTON START FEATURE.  WHEN REPEATED ATTEMPTS ARE NECESSARY TO START MY CAR, I HEAR A 'CLICKING' TYPE NOISE WHEN I PRESS THE START BUTTON, BUT MY CAR DOES NOT TURN OVER.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS PUSHING THE 'START' BUTTON, MY CAR EVENTUALLY STARTS (SOMETIMES AFTER A FEW SECONDS AND A FEW ATTEMPTS, SOMETIMES AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS AND TWO OR THREE MINUTES).  THE PROBLEM OCCURS RANDOMLY, WHEN THE CAR IS COLD AND WARM.  I NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM UNTIL HONDA REPLACED THE WATER PUMP ON MY CAR EARLIER THIS YEAR.  BASED ON OTHER WEB POSTS, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE PUSH BUTTON START FEATURE IN 2013 HONDA ACCORDS.  ONCE MY CAR STARTS, IT RUNS WELL.  AT THIS PRESENT TIME, I HAVE NO OTHER MECHANICAL PROBLEMS OTHER THAN THE PUSH BUTTON START FEATURE.  HOWEVER, MY CAR'S FAILURE TO START IS A SAFETY ISSUE IN ITSELF IF A CAR FAILS TO START IN A SITUATION WHERE A QUICK GET AWAY IS NECESSARY (FOR EXAMPLE, FLOOD, WILD FIRE, OR OTHER NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTER THAT MAY REQUIRE THAT MY CAR START WITHOUT DELAY).",

THE CONCRETE RAMP AND OFFICE BUILDING STOPPED THE CAR IN ITS TRACKS. I PUT IT IN PARK AND GOT OUT. I'M DOING OK BUT MOSTLY VERY VERY GRATEFUL I DIDN'T HURT OR KILL ANYONE.

THERE WERE AROUND 4 CARS TO MY RIGHT WHEN THIS HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY REACH THE EXIT LANE TO THE RIGHT DUE TO THE CURVATURE OF THE FREEWAY TURNING LEFT BY GOING STRAIGHT. AS I SLOWED DOWN THE CAR ON THE EXIT LANE, I YANKED THE STEERING WHEEL VERY HARD TO THE LEFT THEN RIGHT TO MANEUVER THE CAR TO STAY IN THE LANE. AFTER I EXITED THE FREEWAY ON HASTER STREET, I YANKED THE STEERING WHEEL VERY HARD TO THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE TURN AND FOUND A SMALL STREET THEN COME TO A STOP. AT THIS TIME, THE STEERING WHEEL ICON STILL ILLUMINATED ON MY DASHBOARD. I TURNED OF THE CAR AFTER PUT IT TO PARK THEN TURNED IT BACK ON AND THE ICON DISAPPEARED. I GOT CONTROL OF STEERING WHEEL BACK. I PROCEEDED TO GARDEN GROVE STREET HEADING WEST TOWARD MY HOME. AT THE FIRST RED LIGHT ON GARDEN GROVE, I STOPPED AND DID NOT STEER THE WHEEL. AGAIN, THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED ON ME AGAIN. THE ICON APPEARED AGAIN ON MY DASHBOARD. I AGAIN TURNED OFF AND ON THE CAR AND THE ICON DISAPPEARED AND I HAD MY CONTROL BACK. FROM THERE, I DROVE SLOWLY IN THE RIGHT LANE TO MY HOME. THIS TIME, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  ON 4/13/2019, WHICH IS TODAY, I DROPPED OFF MY CAR AT HONDA WORLD DEALER ON 13600 BEACH BLVD, WESTMINSTER, CA 92683 AND TOLD ONE OF THE REPS ABOUT THE PROBLEM. HE DID THE INQUIRY ON MY CAR AND SYSTEM SHOWED THERE WAS A RECALL OF EPS GEARBOX REPLACEMENT AT THIS DEALERSHIP. I HOPE NHTSA WILL TAKE THIS SERIOUS AND HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME. IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE WITH NO CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL.",

THE CONCRETE RAMP AND OFFICE BUILDING STOPPED THE CAR IN ITS TRACKS. I PUT IT IN PARK AND GOT OUT. I'M DOING OK BUT MOSTLY VERY VERY GRATEFUL I DIDN'T HURT OR KILL ANYONE.

TWO DAYS LATER AFTER WORK MY CAR DID NOT START (STATIONARY). CHECK ENGINE WAS ON, CHECK STEERING LIGHT ON & TRACTION LIGHT ON PLUS LOW PRESSURE ON. I IMMEDIATELY FELT UNSAFE TO DRIVE MY CAR BUT HAD TO TAKE IT BACK TO HONDA TO SEE WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO IT. HONDA SAID IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULT AND THAT NOW THE PROBLEM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BATTERY. INSTEAD, IT WAS MY ENGINE WIRE HARNESS. THAT NEEDED TO BE FIXED FOR A PRICE OF ~$2,800 BUT THEY COULD LOWER IT TO $669.15 + TAX   I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM IN HONDA. I BOUGHT A HONDA BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A RELIABLE CAR. BACK IN MARCH 2016 THEY TOLD ME BY BATTERY FAILED THE BATTERY TEST AND DECIDED TO CHARGE IT. NOVEMBER 2016, THEY MADE ME BUY A NEW BATTERY, AT THAT TIME MY CAR WAS STILL BRAND NEW WITH ONLY 22,000 MILES ON IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS COINCIDENCE. I GOT A HONDA FOR RELIABILITY REASONS. I ALSO KNOW YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SERVICE THE CAR FOR THE SAME ISSUE 3 TIMES AND I SHOULDN'T BE CONCERN OF MY 2013 HONDA CAR THAT STILL HAS LESS THAN 30,000 MILES OF ANY ELECTRICAL ISSUES. I AM CONCERN OF SERVICE FRAUD BECAUSE I WAS CHARGE TO RECHARGED AND REPLACE THE BATTERY. ONE TIME I WAS WITHIN WARRANTY AND THE OTHER WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARD. I AM REQUESTING A REIMBURSEMENT OF SOME MANNER; IT CAN BE MONETARY OR FREE SERVICING MY CAR.",

I READ THAT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WAS GIVEN ON THE TORQUE SENSOR 5 YEAR. AS HONDA DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE THEY DID THE UPDATE AND REPLACED THE TORQUE SENSOR, BUT THE PART THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO WORK WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT WAS THE CONTROL UNIT.

I WILL BE WRITING A LETTER TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE REGARDING THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD ONLY EXTEND IT TO THOSE TWO CARS WHEN ACCORD ARE THE NUMBER #1 SELLER.

AT ABOUT 25K MILES MY ACCORD STARTED TO MAKE A VERY OBVIOUS AND DISTURBING DRONING/HUMMING NOISE AT SPEEDS ABOVE 40 MPH.  THE NOISE BECAME PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AS TIME WENT BY.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER 2 TIMES AND ASKED THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM, TO NO AVAIL.    AFTER HAVING NEW TIRES INSTALLED AT 42K MILES, AND THE DRONING NOISE WAS STILL OCCURRING, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER A THIRD TIME AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE NOISE PROBLEM AS COMING FROM A DEFECTIVE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL BEARING AND A DEFECTIVE REAR LEFT WHEEL BEARING.  BOTH WHEEL BEARINGS WERE REPLACED ON JULY 27, 2016 AND THE DRONING NOISE ABOVE 40 MPH IS GONE.  REPLACING THE WHEEL BEARINGS FIXED THE PROBLEM!   THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE WHEEL BEARINGS FAILED, AND HE STATED THAT THE TECHNICIANS AT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT KNOW WHY/HOW THE BEARINGS FAILED EITHER.    I CONTACTED HONDA AMERICA HQ ON AUGUST 1, 800-999-1009, AND WAS TOLD THAT HONDA AMERICA WOULD NOT DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF THE BEARING FAILURES.  THEY ALSO DECLINED MY REQUEST TO AUTHORIZE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE REMAINING 2 WHEEL BEARINGS.  HONDA AMERICA ESTABLISHED A CASE NUMBER FOR MY ISSUE, CASE # 04884545.  DUE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FROM HONDA AMERICA AS TO THE CAUSE/RESOLUTION OF THE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES, I AM CONCERNED THAT THE UNDERLYING BEARING OR WHEEL STRUCTURE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED, AND THAT MY 2013 HONDA ACCORD WILL BE SUBJECTED TO FUTURE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES.",

I PERSONALLY FEEL THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ON HONDAS PART. 2013 WAS THE FIRST YEAR THEY MADE THE HONDA ACCORD SPORT EDITION ( I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP), OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WENT AWRY AT THE FACTORY. WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO EXPLAIN MY PROBLEM, I GAVE THE YEAR,MAKE, AND MODEL OF MY CAR. THE TECHNICIAN THAT ANSWERED THE PHONE REPLIED WITH \"OH, YES MA'AM, I JUST SPOKE WITH YOU 10 MINUTES AGOI?\" IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD CALLED. THAT TELLS ME THERE ARE OTHER 2013 HONDA ACCORD SPORT OWNERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. MAKE IT RIGHT HONDA!!",

WHILE, AIR PRESSURE WAS BEING CHECKED, I LEFT THE CAR ON IN ACCESSORY MODE FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. WHEN I WENT ON TO TURN THE CAR ON, IT WOULDN'T TURN ON. DASH BOARD LIGHTS, FLICKERED AT EVERY ATTEMPT, WHEN I TRIED TURNING ON THE CAR. MY MECHANIC CHECKED THE BATTERY, HE SAID, BATTERY IS DEAD. I HAD THE BATTERY REPLACED. ONCE BATTERY WAS REPLACED, MECHANIC CHECKED ALTERNATOR. HE STATED, ALTERNATOR IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I TOLD HIM, I WILL TAKE THE CAR TO HONDA DEALER. THIS REMINDED ME, THAT SAME THING HAPPENED ON 7/4/2014, WHERE I HAD LEFT THE HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND RADIO ON AT THE SAME TIME IN POWER MODE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. I CALLED HONDA CARE, 1ST DRIVER, COULDN'T JUMP START MY CAR. 2ND DRIVER CAME, AND HE WAS ABLE TO JUMP START MY CAR. HE STATED BATTERY WAS FINE AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, I JUST REALIZED, MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW WAS TAKING LOT LONGER TO OPEN AND CLOSE THAN IT SHOULD. WITH NEW BATTERY, I WILL BRING CAR TO DEALER TO HAVE THE CAR CHECKED. ALSO, SINCE ABOVE INSTANCES, I TURN OFF MY HEADLIGHTS FROM AUTO MODE, AND ALSO INTERIOR LIGHTS FROM DIMMING OR TURNING OFF AUTOMATICALLY TO SAVE BATTERY FROM DRAINING.   2. SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN NOVEMBER 2013, I HAVE NOTICED THAT, I CAN HEAR FUEL MOVING IN THE FUEL TANK. IN MY OLD 2000 HONDA ACCORD, I NEVER HEARD SUCH A THING.  3.

I PLANNED TO GET IT CHECKED OUT AT HONDA. TWO DAYS LATER THE KEYLESS IGNITION FAILED ABOUT TEN TIMES BEFORE FINALLY STARTING.

PREVIOUSLY I HAD A LOW BATTERY (LISTENED TO MUSIC TOO LONG) WHICH FAILED TO START BUT EVEN THEN THE DASH LIGHTS LIT UP & FLASHED. IT SEEMED LIKE BOTH INCIDENTS INDICATED AN ELECTRICAL OR ECU PROBLEM.  I DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE THE INCIDENTS. THEY HAVE HAD MY CAR 3 1/2 DAYS WITH NO WORD.  I FINALLY CALLED TODAY. WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T RECREATE IT SO COULDN'T DO ANYTHING! I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR. I POINTED OUT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS LISTED ON THE ARFC.COM SITE. THE SERVICE MANAGER TALKED TO HONDA ENGINEERS WHO CONTINUED TO CONTEND IT HAD TO BE DUPLICATED IN THE COMPUTER TO SOLVE IT.

I TURNED THE CAR OFF FOR A MOMENT JUST AS THE HONDA MANUAL INSTRUCTED AND WHEN I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON, NOTHING HAD CHANGED, STILL LIGHT ON THE DASH AND NO POSSIBLE WAY OF ME TURNING THAT WHEEL. I CALLED AAA AND THE DRIVER OF AAA CAN VOUCH FOR THIS BECAUSE IT WAS STILL IN THE SAME CONDITION WHEN HE PICKED IT UP.  THIS WAS WEDNESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 23 THAT IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  ON FRIDAY MORNING, AFTER DEALER WAS CLOSED CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS DAY, THEY CALLED ME SAYING NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CARI SAID REALLY!!!  I EXPLAINED TO THEM AGAIN AND THEY RAN A TEST AND IT SAID IT NEEDED SOFTWARE UPDATES AND/OR ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING RACK.  BUT HONDA REQUIRES THE UPDATES TO BE INSTALLED FIRST AND THERE IS A CHARGE FOR THAT ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP.  SO I SAID DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. (WHICH I THINK IS ABSURD, MICROSOFT DOESN'T CHARGE ME MONEY FOR UPDATES)  WITH IT BEING OVER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY, I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY FOR HONDA TO BE CONTACTED (PER DEALERSHIP HONDA WAS CLOSED) SO I WENT 6 DAYS WITH NO CAR.  MONDAY CAME AROUND AND HONDA APPROVED THE DEALERSHIP TO DO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING ON THE CAR AND WITH THE SAFETY CONCERN THEY WENT AHEAD AND REPLACED THE ELECTRONIC STEERING RACK.    I HOPE THIS HAS FIXED THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT BOTHERS ME MORE THAN DRIVING A CAR DOWN THE ROAD AND I LOSE CONTROL OF STEERING.     *TR",

FORWARD, AND BACK AND DOWN YOU COULD STILL MOVE BUT UPWARD NO MORE. AGAIN GOT BACK IN MY CAR ONLY NOW TO JUST MOVE FORWARD A FEW MPH THE SEAT AGAIN FELL BACK DUE TO THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE CAR AND GRAVITY. I TOOK THIS TO THE HONDA BECAUSE IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE TO SHOCKLEY HONDA ONLY FOR THEM TO SAY THAT IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND WANTED TO CHARGE ME $120 TO JUST LOOK AT THE ISSUE. AND THEN TO TELL ME IT WILL TAKE $1200 TO FIX IT! SO SAFETY IS NOT A CONCERN ONLY PROFIT. I SINCE HAVE TO PUT A BOX UNDER THE SEAT TO KEEP IT FROM SLIDING BACK AND FROM HURTING MY BACK FURTHER MORE.

AFTER I HAD PUT ABOUT 3,500 MILES ON THE CAR, A SMALL STAPLE (1/16 IN DEEP) PUNCTURED ONE TIRE JUST BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE TREAD,AND THE WALL FAILED  AND IT RAN FLAT.

WHEN I PUT THE SPARE TIRE ON TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER, I LEARNED THAT THE SPARE WAS MOUNTED ON A 17 IN RIM AND WAS NOT A LOW PROFILE TIRE LIKE THE TURANZA'S. MY COMPLAINTS ARE (1) THE 17 INCH STANDARD TIRE FOR A SPARE WHEN IT IS 2 INCHES SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TIRES AND IS NOT A LOW PROFILE.  I AM WORRIED THAT IF I DRIVE VERY FAR ON THE SPARE I WILL DAMAGE RUNNING GEAR OR BREAK AN AXLE DUE TO THESE DIFFERENCES. (2) ALL THE TURANZA'S ON THE HONDA SAY THEY WERE MADE IN JAPAN AND WHEN I TRIED TO REGISTER THE TIRES ON LINE WITH BRIDGESTONE, IT ASKED FOR A CITY AND DOT.  THE DOT IS EJN1JHE3612 BUT THERE IS NO CITY ON THE TIRE SO CAN'T REGISTER IT.  THE BRIDGESTONE WEBSITE LISTS LOCATIONS OF MANUFACTURING PLANTS BUT NONE ARE LISTED IN JAPAN.  AM I RUNNING KNOCK-OFF BRIDGESTONE TIRES?

EXERTS FROM MY 8/25 LETTER TO HONDA BELOW;    DEAR SIRS,    I WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF AN OCCURRENCE I JUST EXPERIENCED WITH MY 2013 HONDA ACCORD I JUST PURCHASED (6/10/2014).      MY AIR CONDITIONER STOPPED COOLING ON FRI, 8/22/2014 AFTER LEAVING WORK.  AFTER I RETURNED HOME FROM A SWELTERING 45 MILE COMMUTE, I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT ON SAT, 8/23.  AS MY 2013 CERTIFIED HONDA ACCORD WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY (I PURCHASED 74 DAYS EARLY), I WAS SURE THE PROBLEM WOULD BE COVERED @NO COST TO ME.  I HAD EVEN PURCHASED HONDA''S EXTENDED WARRANTY ON 6/10 EVEN THOUGH IVE  NEVER EXPERIENCED REPAIR PROBLEMS WITH MY PURCHASES IN THE PAST.     I WAS TOLD ROAD DEBRIS HAD DAMAGED THE CONDENSER DUE TO ITS LACK OF PROTECTION, ALL OF THE FREON LEAKED OUT, THE CONDENSER WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AND IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE CONDENSER COST WAS $168.00 WHILE WITH INSTALLATION COST WAS $400.99!  AFTER ALL OF MY RESEARCH ONLINE IT APPEARS THIS IS A 'WIDE-SPREAD DESIGN PROBLEM AND HONDA IS ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY OFF OF THE DEFECT BY CHARGING OUTRAGEOUS SERVICE FEES TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

SINCE MANUFACTURERS ARE IGNORING THE ISSUE EXCEPT FOR TOP-OF-THE-LINE MODELS, THE NHTSA SHOULD INTERVENE TO FORCE A SOLUTION TO HELP CUSTOMERS RETAIN SAFETY FEATURES WHILE NOT INCURRING BACK INJURIES.       THIS IS PART OF THE NARRATIVE I POSTED ON ONE OF MANY ON-LINE FORUMS ON THE SUBJECT:  INTERESTED IN BUYING A 2013 HONDA ACCORD EX-L BUT I CAN'T STAND THE HEAD RESTRAINTS. I CAN'T DRIVE WITH MY HEAD LOOKING DOWN. I TESTED IT FOR 45 MINUTES AND ENDED UP WITH A BACK/NECK ACHE. I TRIED A 2012 ACCORD AND FOUND THE SAME PROBLEM. MY 2008 PILOT DOES NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I TRIED A NEW PILOT AND IT WAS COMFORTABLE. CLEARLY, IT MEETS SAFETY STANDARDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING DRIVER COMFORT.   I FOUND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON-LINE ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE DATING BACK TO 2009.  HERE'S ONE OF THOSE WEB SITES: HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/HONDA/ACCORD/2013/   I CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WERE NO HELP AT ALL. THREE TIMES THE LADY I SPOKE WITH REPEATED THE LITANY OF \"SINCE 2009 ALL HONDA CARS....ETC\" REFERRING TO NEW FEDERAL SAFETY REGULATIONS. NEVER MIND THAT THE PILOT DOES NOT SACRIFICE COMFORT FOR SAFETY.  HOW CAN HONDA IGNORE SUCH A PROBLEM THAT MUST BE TURNING AWAY ACCORD BUYERS?  HOW CAN HONDA IGNORE IT WHEN THEY HAVE THE SOLUTION IN ANOTHER ONE OF ITS MODELS (THE PILOT)?  *TR",

WHILE PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT AT A GARDEN NURSERY I APPLIED THE BRAKES BUT THEY DID NOT RESPOND IN ANYWAY, THE ENGINE THEN REVVED UP MAKING A LOUD NOISE, THE CAR LUNGED FORWARD OVER SEVERAL RAILROAD TIE BARRIERS, BUSHES, HIT A TRUCK THAT WAS PARKED IN THE LOT AND CAME TO REST IN A MULCH PILE.  LUCKILY THE TRUCK AND MULCH STOPPED THE CAR AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT INTO PARK AND TURN IT OFF.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE SIDE OF MY CAR AND THE PROPERTY OF THE NURSERY. THIS HAPPENED ON MAY 8, 2014 AT 5:00 PM.  IT WAS A GRAVEL PARKING LOT, DRY SUNNY DAY.   THIS HONDA WAS PURCHASED NEW IN 2013 AND IS A 4CYL WITH CVT TRANSMISSION AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 13,000 MILES.  THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT SITS NOW WAITING FOR A HONDA REPRESENTATIVE TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE.  IT WAS A BLESSING THAT NO ONE WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF MY CAR.  MUCH OF MY DECISION TO PURCHASE A HONDA WAS BECAUSE OF RELIABILITY AND SAFETY; HOWEVER, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  THIS IS MY FIRST HONDA AND I AM THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND ALARMED AFTER THIS INCIDENT.  *TR",

HONDA TELLS OWNERS THAT ALL MANUFACTURERS GET THE SAME COMPLAINTS, AND BLAMES NHTSA FMVSS 202: BOTH ARE UNTRUE!  AFOREMENTIONED 4-12-2013 COUNT SHOWS THIS IS A VERY SEVERE PROBLEM FOR ACCORDS, BUT NOT FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURERS.  THE SEATS IN MY 2013 ACCORD ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PARTLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE NO BACKSET BETWEEN THE HEAD RESTRAINT AND MY HEAD; INSTEAD, THEY IMPOSE A PUSH OF A LEAST 13 MM.  THIS CAUSES DISTRACTION WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF DRIVING, AND WITHIN TWO HOURS GENERATES SEVERE PAIN WHICH IMPAIRS MY DRIVING.   DURING THE FMVSS 202 PROCESS, UMTRI SUBMITTED A RESEARCH FINDING THAT SAID A 50 MM BACKSET WOULD RESULT IN HEAD RESTRAINT INTERFERENCE FOR 13% OF THE DRIVING PUBLIC.  A MAJORITY OF THE MANUFACTURERS, AMONG THEM GM, MAGNA, JOHNSON CONTROLS, AIAM, THE ALLIANCE, NISSAN, PORSCHE, DAIMLERCHRYSLER, AND FORD, STATED THAT A BACKSET OF 50 MM MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INTRUSIONS INTO THE SPACE WHERE THESE OCCUPANTS TYPICALLY PLACE THEIR HEADS, FORCING THEIR HEADS INTO AN UNNATURAL FORWARD-TILTING POSITION.

MOST ACCORD COMPLAINTS INCLUDE THE SAME ELEMENTS: AWKWARD POSTURE, PRESSURE ON HEAD AND NECK, PAIN AND DISTRACTION CAUSED BY THE SEAT/HEAD RESTRAINT.  HONDA TELLS OWNERS THAT ALL MANUFACTURERS GET THE SAME COMPLAINTS, AND BLAMES NHTSA FMVSS 202: BOTH ARE UNTRUE!  AFOREMENTIONED 4-12-2013 COMPLAINT COUNT SHOWS THIS IS A VERY SEVERE PROBLEM FOR ACCORDS, BUT NOT ALL OTHER MANUFACTURERS. THE SEATS IN MY 2013 ACCORD ARE PAINFUL PARTLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE NO BACKSET BETWEEN THE HEAD RESTRAINT AND MY HEAD; INSTEAD, THEY IMPOSE A PUSH OF A LEAST 13 MM.  THIS YIELDS MAJOR DISTRACTION IN 30 MINUTES, SEVERE PAIN IN 2 HOURS; BOTH IMPAIR DRIVING.  OTHER SEAT ERGONOMIC FEATURES EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM.  DURING FMVSS 202 RM, UMTRI RESEARCH SHOWED A 50 MM BACKSET WOULD RESULT IN HEAD RESTRAINT INTERFERENCE FOR 13% OF THE DRIVING PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING GM, MAGNA, JOHNSON CONTROLS, AIAM, THE ALLIANCE, NISSAN, PORSCHE, DAIMLERCHRYSLER, AND FORD, STATED THAT A BACKSET OF 50 MM MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INTRUSIONS INTO THE SPACE WHERE THESE OCCUPANTS TYPICALLY PLACE THEIR HEADS, FORCING THEIR HEADS INTO AN UNNATURAL FORWARD-TILTING POSITION. NHTSA LISTENED, ALLOWS 55 MM. HONDA IGNORED THESE FINDINGS, IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR BAD SEAT DESIGN.   A 1997 CDC REPORT FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE OF A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AWKWARD NECK AND SHOULDER POSTURE/ PROLONGED STATIC LOADS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (MSD); MORE RESEARCH REVEALS THE IMPAIRMENTS FROM MSD: PAIN AND FATIGUE.

BELOW THE LINE; LIGHT,  ABOVE THE LINE; TOTAL DARKNESS.  I HAD TO TURN ON THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS TO ILLUMINATE THE ROAD ADEQUATELY AHEAD, EVEN AT LOW SPEED.  HAVING TO TURN OFF THE HIGH BEAMS WHEN ENCOUNTERING ON-COMING CARS WAS EXTREMELY UNNERVING.  THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE ENOUGH TO READ NORMAL STREET AND INFORMATION SIGNS NOR TO SEE AN OBJECT, PERSON, OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CROSS YOUR PATH. IF YOU TURN THESE LIGHTS ON IN A DARK GARAGE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THIS DEFINED LINE.  WE CALLED THE DEALER WHERE WE PURCHASED OUR CAR AND BROUGHT THE CAR IN AFTER EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM. THE SERVICE INTAKE MANAGER PAGED ME AND TOLD ME THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM, THAT THE LIGHTS WERE NORMAL FOR THIS CAR.  THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO US.  I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER AND THE SERVICE DIRECTOR CAME OUT TO SPEAK WITH US.  HE TOLD US HE HAD ENCOUNTERED  7 OR 8 OTHER SUCH COMPLAINTS BUT ALL WERE DEEMED TO BE NORMAL FOR THE 2013 ACCORD!  HE FINALLY AGREED TO PERSONALLY CHECK-OUT THE PROBLEM.  HE GAVE US A LOANER 2013 ACCORD TO DRIVE HOME.  THE LOANER ACCORD HAD THE EXACT SAME HEADLIGHT FUNCTIONALITY!  THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS PUT ON THE PHONE WITH THE SERVICE INTAKE MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THAT A TECHNICIAN CHECKED THE LIGHTS AND THAT THEY WERE NORMAL AND COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED.  I CALLED HONDA AMERICA AND WAS TOLD THAT IF THE DEALER SAID THE LIGHTS WERE NORMAL THEN THERE WAS NOTHING HONDA COULD OR WOULD DO.

SO IS THE FACT THAT IT PUSHES MY HEAD SO FAR FORWARD THAT IT IMPEDES GOOD VISIBILITY WHEN I TURN MY HEAD TO LOOK BACK OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER.   SLUMPING CAUSES BACK, SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN, UNTENABLE ON A ROAD TRIP AND ALSO IMPEDES VISIBILITY.  EARLIER MODEL HEAD-RESTRAINTS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS ISSUE WON'T FIT DUE TO DIFFERENT CENTER-TO-CENTER POST MEASUREMENTS, SO THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE PARTS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING RESTRAINT (I TRIED -- EVEN WITH ONE IN MY OLDER ACURA). I HAVE READ ONLINE FORUMS IN WHICH DESPERATE HONDA DRIVERS DESCRIBE BENDING THE POSTS OR MAKING OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO RELIEVE THEIR PAIN WHILE DRIVING.
