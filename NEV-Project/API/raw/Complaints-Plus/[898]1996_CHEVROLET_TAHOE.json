THOUGH THE BATTERY IS RATED AT 72 MONTHS, IT ONLY LASTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 24 MONTHS. I HAVE ASKED TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS AT THE CHEVY DEALER (MACPHERSON CHEVROLET) AND THEY SAY THAT IT IS TRUE - BATTERIES ONLY LAST ABOUT 2 YEARS.

THE FIRST TIME GM PAID FOR IT UNDER THE WARRANTY. THE SECOND TIME IT WAS JUST OUT OF WARRANTY SO I HAD TO PAY FOR IT. I ALSO HAD TO PAY FOR REPAIR OF A BATTERY CABLE THAT LEAKING BATTERY FLUID HAD DAMAGED. THOUGH THE DEALER ADMITS THAT THE 72 MONTH WARRANTY IS PRINTED RIGHT ON THE BATTERY, THEY SAY THAT THE WARRANTY ENDS WITH ALL OTHER WARRANTEES AT 36,000 MILES. THAT IS GM POLICY AND THEY SHOWED ME A MEMO FROM GM SAYING SO.       I HAD PLANNED TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. HOWEVER I DO NOT RELISH THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A VERY UNRELIABLE VEHICLE WHEN I TRAVEL FOR ANY DISTANCE, KNOWING THAT THE BATTERY MAY GO DEAD AT ANY TIME.
