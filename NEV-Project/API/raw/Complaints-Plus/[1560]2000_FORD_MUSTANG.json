I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR FORD?S MISTAKE. I HAVE A COPY OF THE INVOICE AS WELL AS THE REPAIR QUOTE FROM RAMEY FORD IN JOHNSON CITY,TN. I WILL FAX IT TO YOU IF YOU WISH.

AFTER BEING ALMOST REAR ENDED, FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A PARKING LOT NEARBY THAT MY CAR BARELY COASTED TO. THE PLUG CAME COMPLETELY OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD AND WAS LAYING ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE WITH THE COIL STILL ATTACHED. I UNDERSTAND FROM FORD, THERE IS ONLY 3 TO 4 THREADS, IN THE CYLINDER HEAD, THAT HOLD THE SPARK PLUG IN. AS ANYONE WITH ANY ENGINEERING OR ENGINE KNOWLEDGE WOULD KNOW, 3 - 4 THREADS ARE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO SECURE A SPARK PLUG IN A CYLINDER HEAD WITH THE COMPRESSION PRESSURE OF THE PISTON. THIS IS CLEARLY A ENGINEERING DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE DISASTROUS EFFECTS IF MY CAR WAS UNABLE TO MOVE OFF THE HIGHWAY. THIS TIME LUCK PLAYED INTO IT (WITH A PARKING LOT NEARBY), BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT TIME? AM I SUPPOSE TO STOP ON THE HIGHWAY AND TAKE MY CHANCES? A PLUG BLOWS OUT AND THERE ISN'T ANYWHERE TO PARK AND/OR THE PLUG ALSO TAKES OUT THE FUEL RAIL RESULTING IN A POSSIBLE FIRE. AS I STATED ABOVE: AN ACCIDENT JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN.  AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH I'VE FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON FORD V8 ENGINES MADE FROM 1997-98 TO 2003. I'M REALLY CONFUSED AS TO WHY THERE HASN'T ALREADY BEEN A RECALL INVOLVING THESE ENGINES. IF I MAKE A MISTAKE, I'M HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MISTAKE. WHY SHOULDN'T FORD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FAILURES THAT COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH? THE NHTSA SHOULD IMMEDIATELY ISSUE A RECALL INVOLVING THESE FORD ENGINES. ANY NHTSA ACTION SHORT OF A RECALL IS JUST PLAIN IRRESPONSIBLE.

I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS NOT KILLED.  WHEN I CHECKED MY ENGINE, IT HAD BLOWN THE SPARK PLUG-I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN ISOLATED PROBLEM UNTIL I CHECKED ON THE INTERNET, AND READ ALL OF THE INCIDENTS WITH FORDS \"SPITTING\" SPARK PLUGS.  I THINK IT IS HORRIFIC THAT FORD WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND DO THE RIGHT THING-\"RECALL\"-HOW MANY WILL HAVE TO DIE BEFORE FORD ACKNOWLEDGES THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR AUTOMOBILES BLOWING SPARK PLUGS.    I WILL SAY THAT AS THE OWNER OF MULTIPLE FORD MUSTANGS INCLUDING 65, 66, 67, 70, 98, 2000 (STILL HAVE THEM ALL).  I WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING ANOTHER FORD IF THEY DO NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THEIR PRODUCT-SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A NOTIFICATION OF A POTENTIAL PROBLEM COULD HAVE SAVED 1000S FROM EXPENSIVE, NEEDLESS DAMAGE TO THEIR AUTOMOBILES. I FOR ONE WOULD HAVE ENSURED THAT I DID FREQUENT SPARK PLUG CHECKS TO ENSURE THEY WERE SECURE, OR WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY TAKEN CORRECTIVE MEASURES BEFORE NEEDED REPAIRS FROM DAMAGE.  AMERICAN MADE SHOULD NOT EQUATE TO INFERIORLY MADE.  I AM REQUESTING THAT I BE REIMBURSED FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED DUE TO A FAULTY DESIGN WITH THE CYLINDER HEAD.  IN ADDITION, I AM REQUESTING THAT FORD NOTIFY THE OWNERS OF THE VEHICLE MODELS WITH THIS DESIGN FLAW TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO NEEDLESS LOSS OF LIFE FROM POTENTIAL ACCIDENTS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS DESIGN FLAW.  *JB",

WHILE AT THIS DEALERSHIP, THEY SHOWED ME THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE CAR.  IT WAS CORRODING AT A PROGRESSIVE RATE. THE CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN DECEMBER 1999. I IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO GALPIN MOTORS AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD NOT ROLL BACK OR BUY BACK THE CAR.  THEIR POSITION IS THAT THE CORROSION CAN BE CLEANED UP BY THE USE OF STEEL WOOL.  I AM CONCERNED THAT PARTS ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE CAR MAY CAUSE A SAFETY HAZARD AS TIME CONTINUES.  THE DEALERSHIP VIEWED THE CAR AND STATED THAT IT WAS SIMPLY SURFACE RUST.  MY CONTENTION IS THAT THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS STATE 7 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE. OBVIOUSLY, I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, AND I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THIS CAR IF THIS PROBLEM HAD BEEN DISCLOSED TO ME.  AS A RESULT OF AN ARBITRATION PROCESS, THE DEALERSHIP HAS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE STAINLESS STEEL EXHAUST SYSTEM AND UNDERCOAT THE BOTTOM OF THIS VEHICLE.  UNFORTUNATELY, I  WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT ONLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE RUST CAN BE CLEANED UP.  THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.
