        "summary": "THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP FAILED.  FORD CLAIMED THAT THIS WAS FROM CONTAMINATED FUEL.  FORD HAS TWO FUEL FILTERS AND A WATER SEPARATOR.  I PERSONALLY ADDED TWO ADDITIONAL FILTERS AND AN ADDITIONAL WATER SEPARATOR, FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR FILTERS AND TWO SEPARATORS.  FORD ALSO HAS A WATER IN FUEL LIGHT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ALERT THE DRIVER TO CONTAMINATION.  AT NO TIME DID THIS LIGHT COME ON.  IN SHORT, I BELIEVE FORD HAS A DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP AND A DEFECTIVE FILTRATION AND WATER ALERTING SYSTEM.  THIS TRUCK SHUTDOWN, WITH NO WARNING AT 70 MPH ON A LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY.  FORD REFUSES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND CONTINUES TO BLAME THE OWNER.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND I WAS FORTUNATE THAT THERE WAS LIGHT TRAFFIC AND I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY STEER THE POWERLESS TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  IN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE, I'VE SEEN THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE 6.7 LITER POWERSTROKE DIESEL ENGINE FROM 2011 ON.",
