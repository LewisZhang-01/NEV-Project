Along with other RV owners, I have just experienced this problem. I was in city traffic when all the sudden multiple warning lights came on: \"ESP, visit workshop\", \"Brake force distribution, visit workshop\", ABS warning light, ESP, warning light, collision prevention malfunction warning light, check engine light with fault code U0416. The presence of all these errors, beeping, red messages sounds extremely scary to any driver. The fact that it says brake force distribution isn't working properly suggests a hazardous condition that could lead to a crash if brakes are not working properly. Since this is being caused by a failing wheel speed sensor, these should all be replaced and the recall expanded to include other models like mine.",

        "summary": "My 2016 Sprinter is suffering from a failing EGR valve that's causing intermittent power loss. The issue started after only 25000mi on the odometer. No errors are shown, nothing indicates malfunction. The problem is quite severe and presenting itself through random power loss. When accelerating the car will jerk and lose acceleration force suddenly. Driving uphill is the worst and producing constant jerking. Once moving at a good speed it's less notable but still present. The main safety concern is that the behavior is unpredictable and in situations where it's necessary to accelerate into a road with traffic, this can lead to a hazardous when the car doesn't accelerate as intended. In multiple occasions I was unable to properly speed up and get moving and thus blocking traffic behind me and forcing them to slow down or change lanes. The Mercedes dealer diagnosed a malfunctioning EGR valve on the edge of failing completely which would put the Sprinter in \"limp home mode\" which has limited power output to prevent further damage. Since this is a known issue and the EGR valves have been failing frequently with various Sprinter models, these should be recalled and replaced! Currently, it's not even possible to get this issue addressed. The EGR valves are back-ordered and not available for 6 MONTHS! That's 6 months of limping through traffic with the potential of the valve failing completely. Unacceptable!",
