THE TIRE TECHNICIAN AT DISCOUNT SHOWED ME HOW TIRE #3 WAS SEPARATED AND READY TO FAIL. THE SPARE NEXT TO IT WAS FLAT ACROSS THE TREAD, BUT #3 WAS NOTICEABLY DOMED. AFTER IT WAS REPLACED HE PUSHED DOWN ON THE TREAD AND YOU COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THE METAL PLIES IN THE TIRE MOVING AROUND.   TBC BRANDS PASSED MY CLAIM ONTO UNICORN TIRE CORPORATION. THEY HAD THE TIRE INSPECTED AND AGREED IT SHOWED STEEL BELT SEPARATION. THEY OFFERED $375 FOR $2000 DAMAGE.   IT IS SAD THESE TIRES ARE USED ON NEW KEYSTONE TRAILERS.   TRAILER MODEL IS COUGAR, NOT AVAILABLE IN WEBSITE PULLDOWN BOX.",
