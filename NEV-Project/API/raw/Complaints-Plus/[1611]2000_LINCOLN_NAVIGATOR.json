WHEN GO TO CHANGE GEARS, THE VEHICLE SOMETIMES WON'T GO INTO GEAR OR IF I PUT IT IN PARK, IT SOMETIMES WON'T GO. THEN I TRIED TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE WHEN PARKING, WHICH IS WHAT I HAD TO RESORT TO DUE TO THE VEHICLE NOT STAYING IN GEAR, IT ALSO WOULD NOT WORK.  I WENT TO GET MY VEHICLE SAFETY INSPECTION AND OF COURSE IT DID NOT PASS. SO THAT PROMPTED MY ONLINE RESEARCH AS TO HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THEN I CAME ACROSS THE RECALL IN FORMATION FOR THIS VEHICLE AND SIMILAR MODELS AND I SEE THAT SOME RECALLS WERE MADE, BUT NOT FOR MY VEHICLE'S YEAR. I WAS WONDERING IF MY VEHICLE'S YEAR MODEL SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN SOME OF THE OTHER RECALLS BECAUSE I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM BUT MY VEHICLE IS A 2000 AND THE RECALL WAS FOR A 1998 AND SO ON.

SINCE I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH LEAVING THE OTHER TIRES ON MY VEHICLE AND HE DID NOT HAVE A LIKE REPLACEMENT, I REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES AND FILED A CLAIM WITH CONTINENTAL (CLAIM #6059007).  CONTINENTAL REPLIED AND STATED THAT THE TIRE HAD BEEN REPAIRED (FUNNY THAT THE TIRE MAINTAINED AIR PRESSURE EVEN WHEN THE ENTIRE TREAD HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF). THIS IS NOT A FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE SETTLEMENT.  I SENT CONTINENTAL THE INVOICE FOR THE COST OF ALL FOUR TIRES ($445.12) AND TWO AUTO REPAIR ESTIMATES FOR THE DAMAGE (~$800.00 AVERAGED). I NOTICED THAT THESE TIRES HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD A RECALL ON THE EXACT TIRE (ID #02T012000) AND CONTINENTAL DID NOT MENTION THIS OR ATTEMPT TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION. I AM FORTUNATE THAT NEITHER ME NOR MY SON WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFECT WHICH FAILED WHILE WE WERE TRAVELLING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65MPH. I DO NOT NORMALLY FILE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS.

THE DRIVERS SIDE HEATED SEAT WAS INOPERATIVE AND I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED A NEW HEATED SEAT ELEMENT. I WAS ADVISED THAT THIS WAS A WARRANTY REPAIR. I APPROVED THE REPAIR AND THE WORK WAS SUPPOSEDLY COMPLETED. IN DECEMBER, 2004 THE HEATED SEAT ON THE DRIVER?S SIDE STOPPED WORKING. I TOOK IT BACK TO HOLMAN FORD OF TURNERSVILLE, NJ ON FEBRUARY 11, 2005 FOR THE HEATED SEAT PROBLEM AS WELL AS A RECALL ITEM. I WAS ADVISED THAT IT NEEDED A HEATED SEAT ELEMENT AGAIN AND THIS REPAIR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I QUESTIONED HOW THIS ELEMENT COULD GO BAD IN SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE HEATED SEAT IS ONLY USED IN COLD WEATHER, IT WOULD ONLY HAVE HAD LIMITED USE. *AK    I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2005. THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME.    MY POSITION IS THAT THERE IS NO WAY THIS ELEMENT COULD HAVE FAILED UNLESS IT WAS NOT REPLACED THE FIRST TIME, THERE IS SOMETHING CAUSING THIS PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED THE FIRST TIME OR THE INSTALLATION IS CAUSING THE FAILURE.     IF ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.     THANK YOU",

HE TOLD ME THEY WERE STILL IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, I DID NOT NEED NEW TIRES. HE BELIEVED THAT THE ONE THAT HAD BLOWN OUT WAS DEFECTIVE. WHAT CONCERNS ME MOST WERE THE COMMENTS MADE BY BOTH THE LINCOLN SERVICE REP & THE INDEPENDENT GOODYEAR DEALER. THAY BOTH STATED THAT THE EXPEDITIONS, NAVIGATORS & EXPLORERS ARE EXTREMELY ROUGH ON TIRES. THE LINCOLN SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SHOWED ME AN EXPEDITION THAT HE WAS CHANGING OUT ALL THE TIRES- IT WAS A 2001 EXPEDITION WITH LESS THAN 30,000 MILES ON THE TIRES. THIS CONCERNS ME...IN ADDITION, MARSHALL BROS. LINCOLN-MERCURY WOULD NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY ON THE TIRES. I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MANUFACTURER. THE CONTINENTAL MFR. IS VERY HARD TO LOCATE. I'M STILL TRYING. I HAVE POSSESSION OF THE MOST RECENT 2 FAILED TIRES @ HOME. THE FIRST BLOW-OUT WAS @ APPROXIMATELY 55MPH WHEN THE CAR HAD 12,000 MILES ON IT. THANK YOU. P.S.

UPON INSPECTION OF THE TIRE, IT WAS NOTED THAT BOTH SIDEWALLS HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TREAD, AND THE VEHICLE HAD RUN A SHORT DISTANCE ON THE ALUMINUM WHEEL.  THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON WE CALLED CONTINENTAL'S CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, BUT THEY WERE CLOSED UNTIL MONDAY.  THE FORD DEALER IN GRAND JUNCTION ADVISED US TO SEE A LINCLONDEALER IN LAS VEGAS.  THE DESERT LINCOLN DEALER 702-257-0687 (RUSS SCHOENBECK) SAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO A CONTINENTAL TIRE DEALER BECAUSE LINCOLN DID NOT WARRANTY THE TIRES ON THE 2000 NAVIGATOR, BUT DID NOW WARRANT THE TIRES ON THE 2001 NAVIGATOR.  HE SAID THAT HE HAS SEEN THREE OTHER 17 INCH TIRE FAILURES ON THE NAVIGATORS, ONE WITH MASSIVE TREAD SPERATION THAT DAMAGED THE CUSTOMERS SHEETMETAL.  THE CUSTOMER, A BROKER, CONVINCED CONTINENTAL TO REPAIR THE SHEET METAL ON HIS VEHICLE.  I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED AT DISCOUNT TIRE IN LAS VEGAS 702-451-1453 AND HAD TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR A NEW TIRE BECAUSE I WOULD NOT LET DISCOUNT TIRE HAVE THE DAMAGED TIRE, IN CASE I HAD TO PROVE THE FAULTY TIRE CAUSED THE WHEEL TO MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE THE TIRE IN MY POSSESSION.  IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO INSPECT IT, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WITH ME PROPMTLY.  I DID REPORT THE TIRE PROBLEM TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY1-800-521-4140 EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS THAT THE TIRE IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED.  SHE SAID THAT FORD DOES NOT WARRANT THE TIRES.
