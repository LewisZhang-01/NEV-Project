They also indicated they had no control over when the part would be available and suggested I call Audi Customer Care for information on when the part might be available. I did as suggested and got a supreme runaround and sent back to the dealer. The service manager indicated to me they would put me on the list and call when they received the part. Unfortunately, they could not schedule me for repairs as they did not have a delivery date for the part from Audi. My system is intermittently showing the airbag is not working. This has been going on for a couple of months. I should be able to schedule my car for repair but cannot as Audi is slow rolling the delivery of the part for this recall. I want to inform NHTSA that Audi is not offering a timely response to this recall. After being notified of the problem several months ago, you would think they could start the manufacturing process to deliver parts in a timely manner. And to send a letter to me and advise that I should schedule the repair only to discover the parts aren't available and I can't get my Audi A3 repaired is very bad on Audi's part.",

I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC SHOP AND THEY SAID THAT I'LL HAVE TO REPLACE THE TIRE AS THEY COULDN'T FIX THE TIRE BECAUSE THE SIDE WALL WAS DAMAGED. ONCE I GOT BACK TO MICHIGAN I GOT A NEW TIRE AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I ASKED BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND PIRELLI ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE TIRES BUT WAS TOLD THIS IS WHAT THE SUPPLIER (PIRELLI) SUGGESTED FOR THE A3. I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THE LOW PROFILE TIRES ON THE AUDI CARS. IF THE DEALERSHIP IS AWARE OF THE ISSUES THEN THIS SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED BACK TO THE OEM AS WELL AS THE SUPPLIER. THIS IS PART OF THE QUALITY AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT DEALERSHIP SHOULD BE PROVIDING TO THE CUSTOMERS. WITHIN A YEAR I HAD TO PAY FOR TIRES BECAUSE THE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HANDLE POTHOLES?
