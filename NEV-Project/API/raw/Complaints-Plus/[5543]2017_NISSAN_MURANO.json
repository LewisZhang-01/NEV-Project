THE SENSOR STILL DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND HAVING THE FORWARD COLLISION WARNING/AUTOMATIC BRAKING NOT RELIABLE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. HAVING THE CRUISE CONTROL NOT WORK IS JUST AN ANNOYANCE. AT NISSAN'S SUGGESTIONS, I'VE CLEANED THE SENSOR MANY TIMES AND I'VE ENSURED THAT NOTHING IS BLOCKING THE SENSOR. IT IS SIMPLY A FAULTY, UNRELIABLE PART AND I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A NATIONAL RECALL. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR OVER 2 YEARS NOW. IT TOOK MANY MONTHS OF COMPLAINING AND SENDING THEM PICTURES OF IT NOT WORKING BEFORE THEY REPLACED THE SENSOR THE FIRST TIME.

I CALLED NISSAN DEALER LOCALLY TO LOOK AND INVESTIGATE HEATING DISTRIBUTION ISSUE. ON THE SAME TIME I CALLED NISSAN CUSTOMER CARE AND EXPLAIN SITUATION. I WAS TOLD BY CUSTOMER CARE TO REPORT FINDINGS BACK TO THEM BASED ON DEALERSHIP RESPONSE. DEALERSHIP RESPONDED IT IS JUST A WAY DESIGN BY NISSAN FOR ALL MURANO, THERE IS NOTHING CAN BE DONE. IT'S JUST A WAY IT IS. I FEEL HELPLESS BY NISSAN OVERALL EXPERIENCE.  NISSAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE HEATED SEAL HEAT DISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE UNIFORM, NOT LIKE ONE HALF OF SEAL GET VERY HIGH COMPARE TO OTHER HALF. THIS IS VERY POOR DESIGN WITH RESPECT TO HEATED SEAT SAFETY.",
