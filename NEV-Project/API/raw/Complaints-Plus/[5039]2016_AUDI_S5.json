THE ISSUE AROSE AFTER DRIVING IN RAINY CONDITIONS (BUT NOT IN STANDING WATER). THE STEERING RACK IN MY CAR PROVIDES ELECTRONIC ASSISTANCE TO MY STEERING WHEEL MOVEMENTS WHILE DRIVING. THE CONTROL MODULE FOR THE STEERING RACK IS LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM CAR'S MOTOR WITH THREE ELECTRICAL PLUGS FOR POWER AND STEERING. THESE PLUGS ARE NOT WEATHER PROOF. AS A RESULT MY STEERING RACK HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING AN ISSUE AND AN ERROR IS PRESENT IN THE CAR'S ECU. A QUICK SEARCH ONLINE ABOUT THIS ISSUE SHOWS THE RACK IS WIDELY USED ACROSS MULTIPLE AUDI PLATFORMS AND HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED OR REMEDIED BY AUDI.",
