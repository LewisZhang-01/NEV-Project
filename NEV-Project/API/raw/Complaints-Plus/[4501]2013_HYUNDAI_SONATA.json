We had done some in town driving for about an hour and we decided he needed practice on the freeway.. after about 15 mins on the freeway my vehicle suddenly shut down without any warning.. my son being an inexperienced driver did a great job of not having an accident being he lost all power steering and power braking functions of the vehicle. Thank god he steered us off the road an into the ditch an not into on coming traffic.. we both were fine but understandably shakin up..

For the engine diagnosis there was a fault code for the knock sensor found. Very low oil levels were in crankcase, no additional fault codes found, abnormal noises. Signs of internal engine problem low oil pressure suspected, no apparent lubricant to upper part of the engine. Recommended replacing the engine. The mechanic estimated the car was also losing oil faster than it should've. Prior to this incident occuring, the car has been regularly maintenanced at the dealership. Car was taken in to an independent mechanic to be looked at because dealership service repair did not have an opening for 2 weeks to look at the car.  The lower acceleration could cause an accident on the freeway if driving at high speeds and the acceleration malfunctions without warning.  No other persons have looked at the car yet. There was no lights, symptoms, or messages indicating a problem prior to this incident happening. This was the first time this incident has happened with the vehicle.",

MY GEARS ARE START TO SLIP IN THE TRANSMISSION. I WAS TOLD IT COULD BE TWO THINGS IT'S EITHER THE TRANSMISSION OR SPEED QUALITY CENSOR.  THESE CARS WERE MADE EITHER VERY FAST OR VERY POORLY OR BOTH AND THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE.     3. ELECTRICAL ISSUES. I HAVE TO MANUALLY ADJUST BY BACK LIGHT/BREAK LIGHTS DAILY BECAUSE THEY NEVER STAY IN PLACE. THE WHOLE WIRING FOR THIS VEHICLE IS HORRIBLE. SOMETIMES WHILE DRIVING THE CAR SUDDENLY STARTS TO SLOW DOWN. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE MY RADIO IS ON BUT DOESN'T LIGHT UP. LIGHT BULBS ARE MELTING INTO LIGHT SOCKETS. ELECTRICAL ISSUES THAT ARE A SAFETY ISSUE FOR MANY WITH THESE MODEL CARS.      EITHERWAY NONE OF THESE ISSUES WERE A PROBLEM UNTIL AFTER HYUNDAI PERFORMED ALL OF THE RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE. THEY CHARGE $200 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC THAT I'M NOT WILLING TO PAY , THESES ISSUES CAME FROM THE MAKERS OF THIS VEHICLE, THESE SHOULD ALSO BE ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST. I'M SURE IF YOU LOOK AROUND ONLINE THERE'S OTHERS WHO'S DEALING WITH THESE ISSUE FROM 2013 - 2021 TODAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT I PURCHASED A VEHICLE AND HAVE TO COME OUT OF POCKET FOR ALL OF THESE REPAIRS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPAIRED FROM THE BEGINNING.

SINCE THE REPLACEMENT THE REPAIRED ENGINE BEGAN DOING THE SAME THING.  MY MECHANIC BEGAN CHECKING THE PLUGS EVERY TIME I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A OIL CHANGE (EVERY 5,000 TO 7,000 MILES) AND FOUND THAT OIL IS CAUSING THE PLUGS TO FOUL OUT AND SO I HAVE TO REPLACE THOSE EVERY 10,000 MILES TO AVOID CONSTANT MISS-FIRING AND POSSIBLE FIRE.  THE BUAREU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR HAS MET WITH THE DEALERSHIP ON THE ORIGINAL ENGINE FAILURE AND ON THE CURRENT PROBLEM (WHICH IS A REPEAT).  THE FIRST MEETING THE DEALER TOLD THE REP. IF I COULD COME UP WITH THE 1 OIL CHANGE RECEIPT I WAS MISSING, THEY WOULD THEN PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  THEY ALREADY KNEW I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN FINDING THAT. WHEN THE REP MEET WITH THE DEALER FOR THE CURRENT PROBLEM, THEY STATED THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO THEM STATING A PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN TAKING MY CAR TO A MECHANIC (TRUECAR CARE IN CAMERON PARK, CA).

WE DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT AND FROM WHAT I READ THE FIX IS EXPENSIVE.  I HAVE A VIDEO OF THE DASHBOARD DURING THE MALFUNCTION IF NEEDED.  THANK YOU.",

SO I HAD KEPT IT AT HALF A TANK AND YET AGAIN IT LOST ALL POWER AND SHUT DOWN ON ME IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING. TOTALLY NOT SAFE! TAKE IT BACK TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE BATTERY AND EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY. I WAS SENT HOME AGAIN! THEN ONE MORNING MY CAR WOULD NOT START. I READ A FORUM THAT SAID JIGGLE THE SHIFT AROUND OR PUT IT IN DRIVE AND THEN BACK UP TO PARK AND THEN PRESS THE BUTTON FOR IT TO START. IT LITERALLY WORKED AND I TOOK A VIDEO OF ME DOING THOSE STEPS. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO HYUNDAI DEALER SHOW THEM THE VIDEO. I ALSO TOLD THEM THAT THE FORUM SAID TO REPLACE THE INHIBITOR SWITCH. THE MECHANIC AGREED BUT YET PUZZLED ABOUT THE CAR SHUTTING DOWN ON ME. THIS HAPPENED AGAIN YESTERDAY FRIDAY FEB 28, 2020 AND I CALLED TODAY THEY SAID MAY BE LOOKED AT ON MONDAY. SO MY CAR IS YET AT THE DEALER UNTIL THE ENGINEERS ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT. I'M TIRED OF GETTING MY CAR BACK AND HAVING THE SAME ISSUES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. MY CAR HAS AROUND 87,000 MILES AND YET UNDER WARRANTY UNTIL 100,000 MILES. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE DANGEROUS ISSUES. I CALLED A FEW TIMES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON MY CAR BUT NO RECALL. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR IN NOVEMBER OF 2019 AND THE ISSUE STARTED A WEEK LATER THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING. IT IS NOW FEBRUARY 2020 AND I'M YET DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. I'M TOTALLY AT WIT'S END. IT WON'T LET ME UPLOAD THE VIDEO BUT HERE ARE A FEW PICTURES!",

DROVE CAR TO CT (FROM NC) ON 7/12/19. CAR WAS FINE EXCEPT THE A/C WAS NOT COOLING WELL. TURNED CAR OFF & LET SIT FOR 10 MINS. IT WAS BETTER. ON 7/18/19 MY 17 YO WAS IN MOTION ON BUSY INTERSTATE 91 SOUTH IN CT. CAR DECELERATED & ALARMS RANG OUT. A WARNING ADVISED \"HYBRID BATTERY FAILURE\" & \"SAFELY PULL OVER\". SHE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO THE SIDE. HIGHWAY SAFETY PATROL CAME & ADVISED HER TO START CAR AGAIN. LIGHTS CAME ON BUT ENGINE WOULD NOT. HAD CAR TOWED TO LIA HYUNDAI IN ENFIELD, CT. CALLED 7/19, LEFT MESSAGE RTC. I ASKED FOR MANAGER WHO ADVISED THE SAME & SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG. I CALLED HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA & GOT A TICKET NUMBER. WAS TOLD THAT IF IT WAS THE BATTERY THEY \"MAY BE WILLING TO PAY AND MAY BE WILLING TO TOW CAR BACK TO NC ONCE COMPLETED\" AGAIN IF APPROVED. NEED TECH TO SUBMIT A WORK ORDER REQ AND SPECIAL TOW REQUEST IF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION WAS APPROVED. ON 7/22 A DIAGNOSTIC WAS RAN & SENT TO HMA SHOWING HYBRID BATTERY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I CALLED HMA & WAS GIVEN A NATIONAL TEAM TICKET. SERVICE MANAGER RICH CALLED ON 7/29 ADVISING HYUNDAI IS REQUIRING MORE TESTS & WANTS PICTURES. HE CALLED BACK TO ADVISE THAT HYUNDAI IS NOW TELLING HIM TO JUST REPLACE THE SAFETY PLUG & RELAY SWITCH. ADVISED HYUNDAI WOULD PAY 60% AND WE WOULD NEED TO PAY 40%. COST WAS $1000 BUT PART NEEDED TO BE ORDERED. CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL WORK. I SPOKE TO NICOLETTE ON 7/29. WAS TOLD THEY WOULD ONLY PAY THE 60% AS A GOOD WILL GESTURE.

CALLED DEALER, SERVICE MANAGER EXPLAINED WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON, AND ECM UPDATE DID EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE. TOLD ME TO TOW IT BACK TO HIM AND HE'D GET IT TAKEN CARE OF. HAD I KNOWN PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE ENGINE ISSUE, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RENTED A CAR FOR THE ROAD TRIP. OR IF THE ECM UPDATE WAS EXPLAINED PROPERLY AT THE VERY LEAST.

THERE'S A LOT OF HYUNDAI OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT NEEDS TO BE FIX BEFORE SOMEONE'S CAR CATCH ON FIRE.",

MY CAR WILL CATCH OR STICK IN THE STRAIGHT UP STEERING POSITION OR WHEN MAKING LONG SWEEPING TURNS.

I CAME TO THE END OF THE ROAD, AND AS THE LIGHT TURNED YELLOW, I PROCEEDED TO SLOW DOWN AND COME TO A STOP. AS I WAS SLOWING DOWN MY BRAKES LOCKED UP, AND I COULDN'T STOP. THE ABS LIGHT DID NOT ILLUMINATE IN MY DASH. THE BRAKES ENDED UP \"KICKING IN\" THANKFULLY ALLOWING ME TO STOP IN TIME. THE SAME DAY, AS I WAS DRIVING BACK TO WORK, I WAS GOING 15 MPH BY WAKEFIELD HIGH SCHOOL, AND I WENT TO GO BRAKE, AND I COULDN'T STOP. ABS SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS KICKING IN, BUT NO ILLUMINATION, AND THANKFULLY STOPPED IN TIME BEFORE HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THAT FOLLOWING WEEKEND, SAME THING HAPPENED PULLING OFF OF MY STREET, AND I COULDN'T STOP AT THE STOP SIGN, AND INSTEAD, SKIDDED DOWN THE HILL AND STOPPED ABOUT 2 FEET PASSED THE STOP SIGN. NO ILLUMINATION. IT FEELS LIKE YOUR SLIDING DOWN AN ICY HILL AND THE ABS KICKS IN, BUT THE LIGHT DOESN'T TURN ON WARNING ME. IT LITERALLY JUST WORKS WHEN IT WANTS AND IT'S EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND SCARY. THE LAST TIME I DROVE IT WAS THIS MONDAY, AND WHEN BRAKING, I COULDN'T STOP RIGHT AWAY, ABS KICKS IN, NO ILLUMINATION, AND MY HEART IN MY THROAT. WHEN READING ON WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT NIGHT, I FOUND THAT THE 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA MODEL HAD A RECALL FOR ABS MALFUNCTIONS DURING MAY 28TH 2014 TO AUGUST 21ST, 2015 WHERE HYUNDAI RECALLED OVER 65,000 VEHICLES FOR THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE FOLLOWING: \" IN THE EVENT OF AN ABS MALFUNCTION, THE BRAKE SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE, BUT THE ABS WARNING LIGHT WILL NOT ILLUMINATE. SINCE THE VEHICLES HAVE ABS MALFUNCTION LIGHTS THAT DO NOT ILLUMINATE, THESE VEHICLES FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD (FMVSS) NUMBER 135, \"LIGHT VEHICLE BRAKE SYSTEMS.\" I SINCERELY FEEL THAT MY VEHICLE IS ALSO AFFECTED AND SHOULD BE HONORED BY THIS RECALL.  *TR",

BIGGEST ISSUE HAS BEEN THE ELECTRIC DOOR LOCK ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE - IT DOES NOT LOCK USING THE FOB OR THE EXTERIOR DOOR HANDLE BUTTON.  DEALER AT FIRST TRIED TO TELL ME I WAS NUTS, IN A VERY CONDESCENDING MANNER, AND THEN HE EXPERIENCED IT.  THE TRANSPONDER IN THE DOOR LOCK HAS BEEN REPLACED 5 TIMES.  THE LAST TIME, THEY HAD TO CALL JAPAN HYUNDAI AND TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE.  THEY HAD MY CAR FOR A WEEK BEFORE THEY DETERMINED THAT THE ACTUATOR WAS SHORTING OUT THE LOCK TRANSPONDER, SO THEY REPLACED THAT AND IT WORKED THE LONGEST IT EVER HAS, PROBABLY ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  NOW HOWEVER THE SAME LOCK DOES NOT LOCK USING THE FOB OR HANDLE LOCK AND IT HAS BEEN JOINED INTERMITTENTLY BY THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR.  I LOCK THE CAR USING THE FOB/EXTERIOR LOCK BUTTON/INTERIOR LOCK BUTTON, AND THEN HAVE TO OPEN THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND MANUALLY LOCK IT. I ALSO CHECK THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR, BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT LOCKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.  THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER WITH THIS MAKES MY STOMACH CHURN.  NOW MY CAR HAS STARTED TO HAVE A PERSISTENT METALLIC TICKING/TAPPING NOISE THAT GETS WORSE WHEN I IDLE.  THEN IT IS MORE OF A KNOCK.  I HAVE RECEIVED WARRANTY EXTENSION INFORMATION AND ALSO THE CLASS ACTION NOTICE RELATED TO SUDDEN ENGINE SEIZURE AND I AM AFRAID THAT IS WHAT IS NEXT BECAUSE ALL THE NOTICES AND COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ SAY IT STARTS WITH ENGINE KNOCK AND THEN THE ENGINE SEIZES.  I HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND LEFT MESSAGES 3 TIMES AND NO ONE EVER CALLS ME BACK.  I'M GUESSING IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER IN CHATTANOOGA, TN.  THE SERVICE GUY NAMED ANDY TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT MY OIL WAS LOW CAUSING THE ENGINE TO LOCK UP, STATING THE OIL LOOKED LIKE SLUDGE!  WE WERE UNABLE TO PRESENT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF MAINTENANCE RECORD, SO WE WERE TOLD OUR WARRANTY WAS VOID. THE OIL HAD JUST BEEN CHANGED IN APRIL AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR THE ENGINE TO LOCK UP OR \"LOOK LIKE SLUDGE\"!. THE DEALERSHIP WANTED ALMOST $6000.00 TO REPLACE THE MOTOR (WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY ACCESSIBLE). WHEN WE ARGUED ABOUT THE WARRANTY, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ASKED US TO PAY $675.00 TO TEAR THE ENGINE DOWN. \"IF\" THEY FOUND A DEFECT IN THE MOTOR, IT STILL MIGHT NOT BE COVERED!!

WE HAD JUST PULLED AWAY FROM A STOP LIGHT AFTER IT TURNED GREEN AND WERE ACCELERATING UP TO SPEED.  WE WERE TRAVELING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 30 - 40MPH WHEN THE SUNROOF BLEW FOR NO APPARENT REASON.   WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR THE NEXT DAY.  THE DEALERSHIP COULDN'T DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE SUNROOF TO RUPTURE LIKE IT DID.  THE DEALERSHIP THOUGHT WE WERE HIT BY A ROCK, BUT BOTH THE WIFE AND I REFUTED THAT IDEA.  WE STAND BY OUR CLAIM THAT IT BLEW FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  EVEN IF A ROCK DID HIT US, THE SUNROOF GLASS SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPLODED/RUPTURED LIKE IT DID.  WE FEEL THERE'S A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE GLASS AND THAT THIS INCIDENT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED MORE CLOSELY.  I HAVE PICTURES IF YOU WOULD LIKE THEM.  *TR",

MY CAR JUST KEEPS WANDERING WHEN DRIVING OVER 50 MPH ON FREEWAY.  IT WILL KEEP WANDERING TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT.  IT REQUIRES CONSTANT CORRECTION TO KEEP MY CAR IN THE LANE AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. WHEN THE CAR WANDERS TO THE LEFT, I WOULD TRY TO CORRECT IT BACK TO CENTER, BUT IT WON'T STAY STRAIGHT AND IT WANDERS TO THE RIGHT AFTER CORRECTION. IT WILL HAPPENS A FEW TIMES LIKE THAT FROM A 15-MILE FREEWAY DRIVE. ONE TIME, I OVER CORRECTED IT AND IT WENT TO THE OTHER LANE NEXT TO ME AND ALMOST HIT THE CAR NEXT TO ME.  IT WAS SCARY AND TOTALLY DANGEROUS.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE NEW TIRES REQUIRED BREAK-IN AND THE PROBLEM WILL GO AWAY, BUT IT HAS BEEN OVER 2 WEEKS OF DRIVING AND TIRES WERE ALREADY FULLY BREAK-IN.  ALL OF THE TIRES ARE WITH GOOD TIRE PRESSURE AT 34 PSI AND IT CAN NOT BE ALIGNMENT ISSUE SINCE THE CAR DOESN'T JUST GO TOWARD ONE SIDE IN HIGH SPEED.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON THE SAME FREEWAY FOR YEARS AND THERE IS NO SUCH ISSUE WITH MY OTHER CARS AFTER I TESTED DRIVE THOSE CARS ON THE SAME FREEWAY, SO IT IS NOT AN ISSUE ON THE PAVEMENT ON THE FREEWAY.  IT IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA'S STEERING.  CONTACTED HYUNDAI DEALERS IN MY LOCATION AREAS, THEY ALL SAID THAT THE SENSITIVE STEERING IS DUE TO THE EPS FOR THE SONATA AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN CHANGE SINCE IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE CAR'S COMPUTER. PLEASE REQUEST HYUNDAI TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR CARS' EPS AND MAKE PROPER ADJUSTMENT, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT OR KILLED SOMEDAY IF THIS IS NOT BEING LOOKED AT. THANK YOU.  *TR",

WE TRIED TO COME TO A STOP BEHIND THE VEHICLE TO CALL THE POLICE AND DEAL WITH THE INCIDENT, BUT THE BRAKES STILL WOULD NOT WORK.

THE FASTER THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING THE MORE PROMINENT THE DRIFTING, SO AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THIS CAN BECOME TIRING, WHICH COULD CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL MOMENTARILY, WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.  THIS VEHICLE IS DESIGNED WITH ELECTRIC STEERING THAT FUNCTIONS NORMALLY FOR TURNING BUT THERE IS AN INHERENT DESIGN ERROR IN THE STEERING CONTROL THAT ALLOWS THERE TO BE PHYSICAL ?PLAY? IN THE STEERING WHEEL.  THIS ?PLAY? IS SIMILAR TO AUTOS THAT HAVE MANY MILES ON THEM.  THEY WOULD HAVE RACK TO PINION WEAR OR BAD STEERING BUSHINGS CAUSING A GAP IN THE STEERING MOVEMENT LEFT AND RIGHT FROM CENTER.  THE SONATA'S ?GAP? ALSO OCCURS WHEN THE STEERING IS OFF CENTER DURING VEHICLE TURNING AND HAS TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO KEEP THE VEHICLE ON TRACK.  THE GAP ON THE SONATA IS ABOUT 1/3?.  THIS CAUSES THE \"DRIFT\".  BY CONTRAST, I ALSO OWN A 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER STEERING AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PLAY IN THE WHEEL, THUS THE VEHICLE GOES EXACTLY WHERE POINTED WITHOUT DRIFT.  IN VA. WHERE I LIVE, GIVEN A SCENARIO WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS OLDER AND GOING THROUGH A STANDARD ANNUAL INSPECTION, THIS STEERING ?PLAY? WOULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO BE REJECTED AS HAVING A SAFETY ISSUE, WHICH WOULD  BE REQUIRED TO BE REPAIRED.
