AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE THE CAR HAD 93,782 MILES ON IT.   I PURCHASED THE MAZDA NEW IN 2001 FROM THE ALMADEN MAZDA DEALERSHIP IN SAN JOSE.  (NOW CAPITOL MAZDA).    THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR INVOLVED TOWING THE CAR TO A SHOP AND REBUILDING THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  THE REBUILD INCLUDED REPLACING THE TORQUE CONVERTER, SOLENOIDS, DIRECT DRUM, SHELL, PISTONS, AND A VALVE BODY UPGRADE AMONG OTHER PARTS.  THE REPAIR COST WAS $3085.00 PLUS TOWING CHARGES.  THE INCIDENT ALSO RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF USE OF THE CAR FOR 1 WEEK.    AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND I CONSIDERED MYSELF AN UNFORTUNATE VICTIM OF UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, SINCE THAT TIME I'VE LEARNED THAT TRANSMISSION FAILURES IN THE 2001 MAZDA TRIBUTE AND THE CD4E AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ARE AN ALL TOO COMMON OCCURRENCE AND THAT MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT RARE AT ALL.

ALL EFFORTS TO RETURN ENGINE TO IDLE SPEED, INCLUDING RAPIDLY DEPRESSING GAS PEDAL TO NEAR THE FLOOR AND THEN RAPIDLY RELEASING IT, WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  THROTTLE WAS STUCK AT 4000 RPM.   HAD TO PUT TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL AND THEN COAST TO A STOP ON AN OFFRAMP.       ONCE STOPPED, I TURNED OFF AND THEN RESTARTED ENGINE SEVERAL TIMES.  AT RESTART, ENGINE WOULD IMMEDIATELY RACE UP TO AND STAY AT 4000 RPM, EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT EVEN TOUCH THE GAS PEDAL.  WOUND UP HAVING TO GET VEHICLE TOWED TO A MAZDA DEALER REPAIR FACILITY, WHICH WAS CLOSED AT THE TIME DUE TO IT BEING SUNDAY.

I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALERSHIP IN JULY 2003 AND THEY LOOKED IT OVER AND COULD FIND NO EXPLANATION, BUT THEY DID A PCM UPDATE ON IT ANYWAY. IT CONTINUED STALLING INTERMITENTLY - NO PATTERN TO THE STALLING. I TOOK IT BACK IN DECEMBER 2003 AND THEY AGAIN LOOKED IT OVER AND COULD FIND NO REASON FOR IT TO BE STALLING. SINCE DECEMBER, I'VE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP IN APRIL AND TWICE IN MAY 2004. IN MAY, WHEN MAZDA RECALLED THE TRIBUTE FOR THE STALLING ISSUE, I TOOK IT IN FOR THE RECALL - THE STALLING BECAME 10 TIMES WORSE, NOW STALLING AT STOP LIGHTS AND AT RANDOM TIMES DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  WE'VE REPLACED THE IDLE SPEED MOTOR, THIS DID NOT HELP. I'VE CONTACTED MAZDA DIRECTLY AND EXPLAINED TO THEM, IN EXACTING DETAIL, THE ISSUES I'VE BEEN HAVING. THEIR SUGGESTION WAS TO TAKE IT TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT HAS ALREADY TRIED TO FIX IT 5 TIMES. THE WARRANTY IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT AND THE DEALERSHIP CHARGES ME WHEN I BRING IT IN, ALTHOUGH THIS PROBLEM WAS PRESENTED WELL BEFORE THE END OF THE WARRANTY DATE.  I LOVE THE TRIBUTE, BUT WOULD LOVE IT MORE IF I COULD GET THE STALLING FIXED.*AK",

IT SEEMED THAT NO MATTER HOW I BRAKED MY ABS SYSTEM WOULD ACTIVATE AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ROLL THROUGH STOP LIGHTS AND STOP SIGNS.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BRAND OF TIRES THAT CAME WITH THE TRIBUTE, SO PURCHASE A NEW SET OF GOODYEAR SNOW AND MUD TIRES AFTER ONLY 12,000 AT A COST OF $300.  BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED THE NEXT WINTER.  THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO FINALLY TAKE IT TO MY MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER CAP WAS CRACKED AND THAT MY REAR BRAKES WERE NOT BEING USED HARDLY AT ALL.  NEARLY ALL OF THE BRAKING FORCE ON MY VEHICLE WAS BEING DONE BY THE FRONT BRAKES.  THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I WAS HAVING SUCH DIFFICULTIES STOPPING ON ICE AND SNOW.  TO NO SURPRISE, MY FRONT BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED AT ONLY 26,000 MILES AND IT COST ME $130.  I DID GET THE MASTER CYLINDER CAP REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATCH THIS IN THE FUTURE.  I HOPE YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE.",

SHUTDOWNS HAVE HAPPENED AT LEAST ELEVEN TIMES - ALWAYS AT LOW RPMS (1000 RPM OR LESS).  EACH SHUT DOWN OCCURRED WHEN I WAS COASTING DOWNHILL.  GENERALLY, I WAS ALSO BRAKING AT THE SAME TIME.  THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DILIGENT IN THEIR EFFORTS BUT SO FAR MAZDA HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I BOUGHT THE TRIBUTE IN JAN 2001 AND EXPERICED THE FIRST FAILURES BEFORE THE FIRST 3000 MILE SERVICING. THE FIRST DEALER RESOLUTION ATTEMPT  WAS NOT DOCUMENTED.  THE TECHNICIAN QUERIED THE ONBOARD COMPUTER BUT THERE WAS NO CODE INDICATING ANY FAILURE.  ON 4/28/02, AFTER MORE FAILURES, THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS A WIRING PROBLEM AND \"FIXED\".   THREE MORE FALILURES OCCURRED BEFORE THE TRIBUTE REACHED 6000 MILES.  THE DEALER COULD NOT DUPLICATE BUT ON 8/8/01 ADVISED MAZDA.  NO REPAIRS WERE MADE.  ENGINE SHUTDOWNS CONTINUED AND ON 10/09/01 AT 7,639 MILES, THE DEALER REMOVED THE BYPASS AIR CONTROL VALVE AND CLEANED THE PASSAGEWAY - AS ADVISED BY MAZDA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE TRIBUTE THEN RAN FINE FOR EIGHT MONTHS.  THEN IN JUNE 2002, THE PROBLEM REOCCURRED AND THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED.  DEALER STILL HAD SEEN NOTHING FURTHER FROM MAZDA CONCERNING RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM AND CONTACTED THEM ONCE MORE FOR ASSISTANCE.  SUGGESTION WAS TO \"RE-PROGRAM\" THE ONBOARD COMPUTER THE NEXT TIME THE CAR IS BROUGHT IN FOR SERVICING.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND WILL UTLIMATELY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.  SO FAR, SHUTDOWNS HAVE OCCURRED WHILE I WAS IN AN UNCONGESTED AREA BUT THAT IS SIMPLY LUCK.  MAZDA AND FORD HAVE A REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND RESOLUTION.  SO FAR I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING FROM MAZDA LETTING ME KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRIBUTE.  GUESS THEY FEEL IT IS NOT A PROBLEM AS LONG AS IT CAN BE IGNORED.",

THEY HAD GOTTEN A LETTER FROM MAZDA STATING THAT THERE WERE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AND NOW THEY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. THEY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY FIXED THE PROBLEM, IT WASN'T COMPLETE.  FURTHER, I JUST HAD MY CAR IN FOR A REGULAR SERVICE CHECK UP/OIL CHANGE YESTERDAY, 4/16/02, A DAY BEFORE THE PROBLEM.  ALSO, I HAD JUST HAD A SERVICE CHECK UP PREVIOUSLY BEFORE THE FIRST PROBLEM WHEN THEY KNEW ABOUT IT THEN.  SO, TODAY, THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN AND NOW, I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  HOW DO I KNOW THERE ISN'T SOMETHING ELSE MAZDA IS NOT TELLING ME?  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE AND TO HAVE A FULL INSPECTION ON THIS PART AND ALL ITS COMPONENTS.  THANK YOU.",

I WAS GOING ABOUT 45 MPH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I COULDN'T STEER THE CAR.  THE POWER STEERING HAD CEASED AND I BELIEVE THE BRAKES ALSO.  I VEERED OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND STOPPED THE CAR.  I PROCEEDED TO FIND A PHONE TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE AND WHEN I GOT THE CAR TOWED TO RIDGEFIELD MAZDA I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER.  WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE AND HE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN HE KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  HE TOLD ME MAZDA HAD GOTTEN SEVERAL TRIBUTES COME IN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH IS THE IGNITION FAILS AND EVERYTHING GOES OUT LIKE THE STEERING ETC.  JUST WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.  OBVIOUSLY, MAZDA KNEW OF THE PROBLEM, AND I QUESTIONED HOW THEY COULD NOT NOTIFY OTHER DRIVERS OF THIS MALFUNCTION.  HE TOLD ME IT WASN'T CONSIDERED A RECALL AS OF YET EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD SEVERAL CUSTOMERS COME IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE AND IT SHOULD BE RECALLED.  THE TRIBUTE IS A NEW VEHICLE AND I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY STILL BE KINKS/BUGS TO WORK OUT WITH A NEW VEHICLE BUT THIS ISN'T A MINOR PROBLEM.  I WOULD LIKE THIS CHECKED INTO AND IF POSSIBLE, MAKE IT A RECALL SO THIS WON'T HAPPEN TO OTHER DRIVERS.  LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO STEER THE CAR TO A SAFE LOCATION, BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.  I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE.  THANK YOU.. *AK",

PROGRAMMING FOR THE KEY HAD TO BE DONE MORE THAN ONCE WHILE MY HUSBAND WAITED AN ADDITIONAL HOUR AND VIEWED THE SERVICE PERSONAL PUSH OUR VEHICLE BACK INTO THE SERVICE BAY.  HE WAS TOLD THERE WAS A PROBLEM PROGRAMMING THE NEW KEY.  LATER IN THE MONTH, THE CAR WOULD NOT START (2 INCIDENTS-6 TRYS).  ON THE NEXT TRIP TO THE DEALER TO HAVE OTHER WARRANTY WORK DONE, I WAITED FIVE AND A HALF (5 1/2) HOURS OVERALL AND WAS INFORMED THAT THEY COULD DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE (3) KEYS.  LATER I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED AND I SOON RETURNED HOME.  ABOUT ONE AND A HALF (1 1/2) HOURS AFTER THE FIX, THE CAR WOULD NOT START AGAIN FOR 15 HOURS (VARIOUS TRYS).  THE DEALER ARRANGED A FREE RENTAL CAR AND WAS TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED THAT MONDAY MORNING.  THE KEYS WERE LEFT IN THE IGNITION OVER NIGHT AND THE CAR STARTED THE NEXT MORNING.  I AGREED TO TRY A TEMPORARY FIX SUGGESTED TO THE DEALER BY MAZDA TECH SUPPORT.  THREE (3) WEEKS LATER, THE CAR STARTED HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND THE TEMPORARY FIX DID NOT WORK. WHAT DID GET THE CAR TO WORK WAS THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF THE DRIVER DOOR OR UNLOCKING AND LOCKING WITH KEYLESS ENTRY.  I RECORDED (35 WITNESSED) MALFUNCTIONS.  THE CAR WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER LAST MONDAY FOR A NEW MAZDA TECH SUGGESTED REPROGRAMMING OF THE KEYS.  UPON MY RETURN THURSDAY WHILE WAITING FOR THE TWICE REQUESTED WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE TEMPORARY FIX AND THE NEW REPROGRAMMING THE RUNNING CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE SERVICE ENTRANCE.
