THESE WIRES WERE FREE TO ARC ON EACHOTHER CAUSING SUDDEN LOSS OF ACCELERATION, CAUSING SUDDEN ACCELERATION(THIS CAR IS EQUIPED WITH AN ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY AND WILL ACCELERATE WITHOUT DRIVER IMPUT), FINALLY FAILED THROTTLE RESPONSE! ALL OF THESE INSTANCES CAN, AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SAFETY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE, AND CERTAINLY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ACCIDENTS IN THE PAST, I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW LUCKY I AM TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THESE ISSUES HAVING NARROWLY ESCAPED MANY POTENTIAL ACCIDENTS (THANKFULLY OTHER CARS HAVE RELIABLE BRAKING SYSTEMS). (THAT WAS THE FIRST HARNESS REPLACED). THE SECOND HARNESS TO FAIL ON ME WAS THE STARTER HARNESS, AGAIN ALL OF THE INSULATION LITERALLY CRUMBLED TO DUST AND LEFT BARE UNFUSED HOT WIRES EXPOSED, THIS COULD RESULT IN A BATTERY EXPLOSION, ARCING ETC... THE THIRD HARNESS THAT I HAVE JUST BEEN MADE AWARE IS YET AGAIN FAILED IS THE AIR FLOW METER HARNESS AS DIAGNOSED BY MERCEDES BENZ OF CINCINNATI. AGAIN THESE WIRES ARE BARE AND I COULD PHYSICALLY SEE THE WIRES ARCING, WHICH RESULTED IN MANY DRIVEABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING LOSS OF ACCELERATION. I REALLY TRUELY AM AMAZED THAT THIS CAR HAS NOT CAUGHT ON FIRE YET! THE FINAL FLAW IS THE STARTER IS LOCATED LITERALLY INCHES FROM THE FUEL VAPOR CHARCOAL CANISTER, IT LITERALLY PURGES FUEL VAPOR DIRECTLY ONTO THE STARTER! ON MANY CASES THE CAR HAD A FUEL SMELL WHILE WALKING TO THE CAR, I WOULD THEN TURN THE KEY WITH A HUGE BRIEF EXPLOSION FOLLOWED BY SMOKE ROLLING OUT OF THE ENGINE BAY.  IT PUZZLES ME HOW MERCEDES HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH A SAFE AUTOMOBILE. I WOULD BE HAPPIER WITH A BLOWN ENGINE!!!  *TR",
