BOTH GILBOY AND FORD TOLD ME THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE REAR AXLE. I HAD 3 CHILDREN IN THE CAR, 2 OF WHICH WERE MY OWN. THIS WAS THE SCARIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE AS I FEARED WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN.  LUCKILY, SOMEONE FROM ABOVE WAS LOOKING AFTER US BUT I FEAR THE NEXT FORD WINDSTAR OWNER MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.  PLEASE DO NOT WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GET KILLED BEFORE TAKING ACTION.  PLEASE HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ALERT ALL FORD WINDSTAR OWNER OF THE SERIOUS POTENTIAL RISK. *TR",

THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE ENGINE RUNNING ROUGH AT IDLE.  AGAIN A TSB WAS ISSUED BUT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT CORRECTED IN THE 2002 MODEL YEAR.  THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT WAS REPORTED HERE WAS DUE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL SINKING TO THE FLOOR WHEN THE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED.  ADDITIONALLY, BRAKE FLUID WAS FOUND LEAKING FROM THE TOP OF THE MASTER CYLINDER RESERVOIR. *AK",

ALSO, IN SOME VEHICELS THE DRIVERS SEAT WAS OFF-SET FACING TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR.  I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT COULD LEAD ONE TO OVER STEER OR OVER CORRECT DUE TO THE MIS-PRECEPTION OF WHERE THE VEHICLE IS ACTUALLY BEING GUIDED.  SO FAR THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT ADVISED ME OF WHY THE VEHICLE IS DESIGNED THIS WAY, BUT AGREES THAT IT WAS BUILT LIKE THIS FOR SOME REASON.  HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET FORD ENGINEERS TO TELL WHY THEY DESIGNED THE STEERING COLUMN THIS WAY.  LOCAL DEALER SERVICE CENTER HAD ADJUSTED MY VEHICLE'S STEERING COLUMN TO BE MORE PARALLEL TO ME, BUT IT IS STILL SLANTED AND AT TIMES MAKES STEERING A LITTLE CONFUSING. *AK",
