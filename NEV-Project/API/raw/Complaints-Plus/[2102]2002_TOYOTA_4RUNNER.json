Given I am the original owner, have gargage-kept my vehicle, have very low-mileage - 74,000 miles, and have maintained the vehicle immaculately and am aware of rusting problems with other Toyota [truck] frames, etc. this seems to be a defect in the manufacturing process.

THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE RUST FORMS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE FRAME AND WORKS ITS WAY OUT DESTROYING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE VEHICLE.   IT SEEMS THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN USED TO WORK AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND KNEW EXACTLY WHERE TO LOOK FROM HIS PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER 4RUNNER FAILURES.    THE TOYOTA DEALER  INFORMED THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE COVERED.  MY ?02 4RUNNER IS FROM THE SAME GENERATION (3RD) AND OF SIMILAR DESIGN TO THE TACOMA THAT WAS RECALLED FOR THIS  THE DEALER INSTRUCTED ME TO CONTACT THE TORRANCE, CA TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AS HIS DEALERSHIP WOULD BE UNABLE TO ASSIST IN ANYWAY.  IT WAS CLEAR THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THIS BEFORE.    THROUGH DISCUSSION WITH TOYOTA  CA THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF PROVIDING ANY MEANS OF RELIEF FOR A KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED SAFETY PROBLEM.  ONE REP DID COMMENT THAT THE TUNDRA AND SEQUOIA HAD BEEN RECENTLY ADDED TO THE RECALL BUT THE 4RUNNER WAS ?NOT YET? ON THE RECALL LIST.   IT SEEMS TOYOTA VIEWS THE PRODUCTS TO BE DIFFERENT DUE TO THE BODY STYLE DIFFERENCES OR US VS JAPANESE BUILT PRODUCTS.  THEY ALSO CLEARLY HAVE NO INTENTION TO ESCALATE INTERNALLY.  I WAS INSTRUCTED TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA AND NTSB.    RESEARCH ON LINE SHOWS THAT THERE IS A VERY WIDESPREAD ISSUE THAT TOYOTA IS CLEARLY CHOOSING TO IGNORE.

THE CAR SUDDENLY GOT VERY BUMPY AND IN A MATTER OF SECONDS, THE REAR RIGHT TIRE EXPLODED ON MY TOYOTA 4RUNNER.  I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE BUT MANAGED TO FINALLY PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE.  AFTER EXAMINING THE DAMAGES TO MY VEHICLE, I   NOTICED THAT THE TREAD ON THE RIGHT REAR TIRE COMPLETELY SEPARATED ALL THE WAY AROUND THE TIRE.  LUCKILY, THE CAR DID NOT FLIP OR COLLIDE WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE.  I SUSTAINED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL INJURIES AND OVER $2000 WORTH OF DAMAGES TO MY CAR AS A RESULT OF THE BLOWOUT.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 36K MILES ON IT AND IS ALWAYS KEPT IN THE GARAGE. THE TREAD ON ALL 4 TIRES IS PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW AS IT IS DRIVEN SELDOMLY, WITH REGULAR TIRE ROTATION/BALANCE/MAINTENANCE.  THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY REASON FOR A TIRE WITH THIS LITTLE WEAR AND TEAR TO EXPLODE THE WAY IT DID.  I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND REALIZE THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAD A FAR WORSE OUTCOME, AND THAT THE TIRES ARE INDEED DEFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, MY INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT COVER THE EXPENSES OF THE TIRES. NOW I AM FORCED TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES OUT OF POCKET FOR FEAR OF THE SAME SCENARIO AND NOT AS LUCKY OF AN OUTCOME IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.  IN MY RESEARCH, I ALSO SAW THAT NHTSA HAS OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE TREAD SEPARATION PROBLEMS INVOLVING DUNLOP TIRES SOLD AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON 1995-1999 NISSAN PATHFINDER SUVS. NHTSA SAYS IT HAS RECEIVED SIX REPORTS OF INJURIES IN TWO ROLLOVER CRASHES THAT WERE BLAMED ON TREAD SEPARATIONS ON THE GRANDTREK TG35 TIRE.  I FEEL THAT UNLESS I SUSTAINED LIFE-LONG INJURIES, PARALYSIS, OR DEATH WOULD THE TIRE MANUFACTURER COME FORWARD WITH ANY GOODWILL OR COMPENSATION.  *TR",

THERE ARE NO TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS IN SOUTH KOREA, HOWEVER, LEXUS (OWNED BY THE SAME PARENT COMPANY) IS LOCATED IN SEOUL.  IT TOOK THE TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE FOLKS TIL AUG TO NOTIFY ME THAT MY ISSUE HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO TOYOTA HQ IN JAPAN FOR RESOLUTION.  IN SEPTEMBER I FOLLOWED UP SINCE NO ONE HAD CONTACTED ME ABOUT THE SITUATION.  I WAS TOLD BY TOYOTA THAT TOYOTA HQ HAD UP TO 4 MONTHS TO WORK THE ISSUE.  TOYOTA WOULD ALSO NOT PROVIDE THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE OFFICE IN JAPAN HANDLING THE ISSUE AND ALSO WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE VENDOR THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE RECALL WORK.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AS I'M DRIVING MY WIFE AND ONE YEAR OLD CHILD IN THIS VEHICLE WITH AN IDENTIFIED DEFECT IN THE FRONT SUSPENSION.    ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE TO HAVE TOYOTA QUICKLY RESOLVE THIS MATTER WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *NM",

MY COMMENT TO THEM WAS CONCERNING THE REAR DOOR, WHICH I HAD NOT USED THAT MUCH AND OVER THE LAST 6 MONTH MAYBE 3 TIME AT THE MOST PER WEEK, CERTAINLY NOT ALOT.  WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME WAS THAT THE DOOR HANDLE MECHANISM IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND SO IS THE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE. MY CONCERN AS A CONSUMER THAT TOYOTA DID NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE TO USE A PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE AND MECHANISM AND GIVEN THAT THINGS BREAK SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF 300.00 TO REPLACE.  I CONTEND THAT METAL PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF THE HANDLES.  CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE MERCY OF CAR MANUFACTURES TO PUT ANYTHING INTO A CAR THAT WOULD UTIMATELY WOULD PROVE NOT IN THE CONSUMERS BEST INTEREST.  I AM SUGGESTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL TOYOTA' DOOR HANDLES.  PARTICULARLY THE TRUCK WHICH BY DESIGN ARE SUPPOSE TO ENDURE TOUGH USESAGE.",

THE PROBLEM IS EXAGGERATED WHEN THE ROADS ARE SLICK, AS THE CAR ALSO SPINS SIDEWAYS DUE TO LOSS OF MOMENTUM FOR WHICH THE VEHICLE IS FORCED TO COMPENSATE CREATING TOTAL LOST OF TRACTION AND DRIVER CONTROL.  MY WIFE AND I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BECAUSE TOYOTA ADVERTISED IT AS \u001cTHE VEHICLE THAT CAN TAKE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.\u001d  TOYOTA ACTUALLY SHOWS A VEHICLE CLIMBING A VERY STEEP MOUNTAIN.

AS CONTACT OCCURRED, I HAD MY WHEELS TURNED HARD TO THE RIGHT THUSLY CAUSING MY VEHICLE TO GRADUALLY WHIP THE BACK END AROUND CAUSING A SIDE IMPACT AS WELL.  THE OTHER VEHICLE WAS PUSHED NORTHWARD APPROX. 15-25 FEET BEFORE THE COLLISION CAME TO AN END.  BOTH VEHICLES WERE DISABLED IN THIS OCCURRENCE WITH DAMAGE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE AND FRONT ENGINE COMPARTMENT OF THE OPPOSING VEHICLE.  AND, DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END, BOTH SIDES, LEFT REAR WHEEL, AND FRONT ENGINE COMPARTMENT OF MY VEHICLE.  THE OPPOSING VEHICLE WAS TOTALLED OUT AND MY VEHICLE HAS INITIAL ESTIMATES IN THE $16,000-$17,000 PRICE RANGE.       TO MY COMPLAINT, THREE THINGS HAPPENED THAT BROUGHT ME GREAT CONCERN.  FIRST, AS I WAS TRYING TO AVOID THE COLLISION WITH THE OTHER VEHICLE BY APPLYING MY BRAKES AND TURNING MY WHEELS, THE LEFT REAR TIRE SLIPPED OFF OF THE FRAME OF THE WHEEL INSTANTLY DEFLATING LEAVING ME WITH ONLY ONE GOOD TIRE TO BRAKE ON.  SECOND, UPON CONTACT WITH THE OTHER VEHICLE, MY SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK OUT CAUSING ME TO BE JETTISONED UP OUT OF MY SEAT AND FORWARD INTO THE FRAMEWORK WHERE THE ROOF, FRONT WINDSHIELD, AND DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW COME TOGETHER.  HEAD, NECK, AND HIGH SPINAL INJURIES OCCURRED.  THIRDLY, THE AIR BAGS AT NO TIME DEPLOYED.  SPEED ESTIMATES UPON IMPACT WERE APPROX. 30MPH.  UPON DOING RESEARCH, I HAVE COME TO FIND THAT MOST AIR BAGS ARE SET TO DEPLOY IN ACCIDENTS WHERE MORE THAN 50% OF THE FRONT END HAS DAMAGE AND THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 12-18MPH.
