The front right tire, has two substantial cracks and one section where a more open gap occurred in the exterior sidewall. In this latter section, it is very near the tire's tread. We have less than 14,000 miles on this vehicle, as we are retired and did not drive much to begin with, but even less after the Pandemic occurred.   Additional Details (below) - I first saw the tire issues on 11/10/2021, but the tire has not yet failed.
