THAT THOUGHT ASIDE, IT IS CRIMINAL THAT IT TOOK LINCOLN 20 MONTHS TO DETERMINE THEY HAD THE AFFECTED AIRBAGS IN THIS VEHICLE AND ALERT THE OWNERS OF SAID VEHICLES. IT HAS NOW BEEN 5 MONTHS SINCE I RECEIVED THE LETTER. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD I HAVE CONTACTED THE COMPANY MANY TIMES AND NEVER HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO OFFER ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER. IT HAS BEEN OVER 2 YEARS SINCE THEY DETERMINED THE AIRBAG IN MY VEHICLE CAN KILL MY PREGNANT WIFE IF EVER DEPLOYED. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.   MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE IS 8 YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN THE PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA. CONSIDERING THOSE TWO FACTORS I AM IN THE HIGHEST RISK CATEGORY. HOW HAVE I NOT BEEN CONTACTED TO HAVE THIS FIXED? AT THE VERY LEAST, WHY HAVE I NOT BEEN OFFERED A LOANER VEHICLE WHILE THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM? IT CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE LINCOLN IS CONSIDERING MY WIFE'S LIFE A FINANCIAL RISK THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE. THE WAY THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED IS INCONCEIVABLE. PLEASE HAVE LINCOLN LOOK TO MAKE MY VEHICLE A PRIORITY. I AM AN ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER WHO WILL BE RELOCATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN MARCH 2017 AND AM HIGHLY CONCERNED THAT AT ANY POINT DURING THE DRIVE MY WIFE AND UNBORN CHILD MAY BE KILLED BY A KNOWN ISSUE.  *TR",

THIS IS A WELL KNOW SAFETY ISSUE WHICH FORD HAS REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE. I HAVE RECEIVED A RESPONSE FOR FORD (SEE ATTACHED) INDICATING THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST ME WITH THE REPAIR. MY CONCERN IS SAFETY.

AT ONE POINT THE DEALER SENT ME TO AN INDEPENDENT TIRE COMPANY.

THEY DID PUT A SEALANT ON THE AREAS BUT IT WAS A TEMPORARY FIX.  NOW I'M HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT WHEEL LOSING AIR.
