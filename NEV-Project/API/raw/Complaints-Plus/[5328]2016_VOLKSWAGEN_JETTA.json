My car clearly had a recall this is ridiculous and not fair Do You think i did this on purpose expecting something back from these greedy not caring people in the world today lol yeah right . i loved my car was satisfied and had no issues until this one complete horrific incident that i almost got locked in and could of got injured or died. I was working and paying for my car i do not expect anything from anyone for free and that is why all the VW customer satisfaction guarantee literature i have read is of course just a bunch of sound good tell the customers what they want to hear and of course yeah Of coursr to good to be true !!!!",

Now , the car is jerky while stopping and still unpredictable in its application of brake force.   When taking off from lights, occasionally the transmission will stop providing power from the hybrid system to the wheels forcing driver to stop and restart the car in the intersection resulting in near accidents.  The car\u2019s gas engine often will fail to start while driving resulting in a loss of power when the car\u2019s hybrid battery is depleted. The driver has had to pull over to stop and restart the car. Failure to start often happens on first startup as well.   The car will no longer remain in electric mode due to this issue and often cycles the engine on and off many times while sitting at red lights.",
