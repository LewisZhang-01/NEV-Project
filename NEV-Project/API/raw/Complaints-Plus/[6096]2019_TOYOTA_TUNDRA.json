Went to dealer on both occasions and because it doesn't log the data there was nothing they could do. Did my own research and there was a technical service bulletin for certain VINS (not mine) to \"repair\" this module behind the grill. It was done to my truck but not by my dealership before I took ownership. It should not have been done and Route 44 toyota just did nothing. I asked for a replacement and they wouldn't because there wasn't any codes listed to warrant it because the TSB wasn't for my truck even though someone did it.

        "summary": "My son was driving to Mineral Wells to get something to eat on Wednesday 11/17/21 at 8:00 at night on FM 52 South.  All of a sudden the steering wheel falls in his lap.  He picked it up and shoved it onto the column and was able to steer the truck onto the side of the road without hitting anything.  He looked underneath the steering wheel assembly and 2 of the 4 ubolts where missing.  Where did they go - if they were ever there in the first place.  The steering wheel has had some vibration and we have had the truck front end aligned and the wheels balanced.  I had it in not long ago for an inspection/oil change/tire rotation.  After I left the dealership the wheel felt a little loose and there was some vibration but I thought it was the road and it did stop vibrating.  I also drive a Prius and I thought maybe I'm just not used to the way the truck feels.  I told my son when I got home that it felt loose and he said he would keep an eye on it.  Then Wednesday night the steering wheel falls off and the whole column falls out.  What is this?  I also drive the truck and I do not think I would have had #1 - the strength to pick the wheel up and force it back onto the column or #2 - the sense to even do that.  I would have had an accident.  The Shottenkirk dealership does not want to deal with the problem even though I have an extended warranty so today Freeman Toyota calls me and they are picking up the truck and will be doing the repair work. Bottom line - my son could have been killed or injured, I drove the truck Monday in Ft. Worth going 70+mph and I could have been killed or injured. How does a steering wheel/steering column loose ubolts and falls off/collapses?",

Another issue is when the Valdosta Toyota (GA) dealer attempted to fix the fuel pump recall on 22 JUL 2020 it was assembled incorrectly. I called the dealership and told them to come and get my Tundra because gas was dripping onto my driveway. They sent a tow truck and it was supposedly fixed and they brought it back to me in about 2 hrs. It really does run the way it did before they \u201cre-fixed\u201d it. Very often now when it is driving I feel something like a failing fuel pump. It fades away but it is not comfortable taking it long distances. It feels like there is a clog in the fuel system or something, although there is not. I have 33,400 miles on it today and I can\u2019t help but wonder if Valdosta Toyota didn\u2019t just exchange the original fuel pump with a different used one?",

WHEN I RETURNED HOME I FILED A CASE WITH TOYOTA USA. I THEN CALLED THEM THE NEXT DAY. TODAY I CONTACTED THE DEALER ABOUT TAKING IT IN FOR THE TO CHECK. AT THAT TIME THE SERVICE REP ADVISED ME THERE IS A RECALL ON THE PART SENSOR ON THE ANTI COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM.     I RECEIVED AN EMAIL REPLY FROM TOYOTA USA HOWEVER THE REPLY DID NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION , OTHER THAN THE CASE WAS GOING TO BE ENTERED INTO THEIR DATABASE.     THEY WILL PLACE A FOAMY TAPE ON THE BACK OF THE SENSOR AFTER RUNNING A DIAGNOSTIC ON IT. THIS SEEMS A BIT UNDER DONE AND A BAND AID FOR WHAT COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD. IF IT IS A WATER ISSUE (NO RAIN ON THE DAY IT HAPPENED AND DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THE WAY TO MY DESTINATION)    I RESEARCHED THE VIN FOR THE RECALL AND I RECEIVED \"THERE IS NO RECALL ASSOCIATED WITH MY VIN, ANSWER.    HOPEFULLY THE NHTSA WILL DO A SIMPLE WEBSITE SEARCH AND SEE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HAVING THIS ISSUE. I PREFER NOT TO HAVE ANY SAFETY ISSUES WHILE TRANSPORTING MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE.",
