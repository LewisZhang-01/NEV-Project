THE ESTIMATE FOR SUCH REPAIR WAS $6,780.28 PLUS TAX  AND WOULD INVOLVE REPLACING THE SHORT BLOCK.   HE MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM WAS KNOWN TO  OCCUR WITH VEHICLES HAVING THE 2AZ-FE ENGINES SUCH AS THE ABOVE HIGHLANDER AND THAT I COULD RESEARCH SAME.   SINCE I WAS BUYING ONLY TOYOTA CARS SINCE 1972 AND HAVE OWNED 4 SUCH CARS AND ONE LEXUS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND CONCLUSION THAT  RELIABILITY IS NUMBER ONE WITH TOYOTA.   I CAN ONLY SAY I WAS IN SHOCK.  WHEN I TOLD MY WIFE (THIS IS ACTUALLY HER AUTO), SHE WAS SICK FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.     A SHORT DISCUSSION WITH AAA.  SUGGESTED WE LOOK AT THIS WEB SITE FOR COMPLAINTS, ETC.  IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND APPLIES TO SEVERAL MODELS INCLUDING THE RAV-4 AND HIGHLANDER SOME WITH MUCH LOWER MILEAGE BUT THERE IS NO ACTUAL RECALL OR LETTER NOTICE FROM TOYOTA.   ALSO, NO PROPOSED ACTION BY DEALERSHIPS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.   I THINK THAT DUMPING THIS SUDDEN, MAJOR EXPENSE PROBLEM ON OWNERS IS VERY IRRESPONSIBLE- NOT WORTHY OF TOYOTA.   COMPENSATION REGARDING THE TIME LOSS AND EXPENSE SHOULD BE OFFERED TO OWNERS OR DEALERS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED BY TOYOTA TO RESOLVE WHEN FOUND.   PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS VEHICLE AND ALL THE PREVIOUS WAS SERVICED BY TOYOTA /LEXUS DEALERSHIPS.   A POSITIVE RESPONSE WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

I IMMEDIATELY CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR COULD STOP SUDDENLY AND LEAVE US STRANDED SO I MADE AN APPT FOR MONDAY MORNING. THE CAR RODE VERY ROUGH FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS AND IT SEEMED AS IF IT IS READY TO STALL ANYTIME. TOYOTA CHARGED ME $ 321.00 FOR A COMPRESSION AND DIAGNOSTICS TEST. TOYOTA FOUND THAT I HAD LOW COMPRESSION. TOYOTA ALSO OFFERED TO TAKE APART MY ENGINE FOR 2667.00 TO SEE IF THE RINGS WERE DAMAGED. I REFUSED THE WORK AND PICKED UP MY CAR. WE CALLED AN ENGINE REPAIR BUSINESS. THE OWNER KNEW THE MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR OF MY CAR AND ASKED IF WE HAD JUST HIT THE 100,000 MILE MARKER. WE HAD. HE TOLD US OF THE OIL SLUDGE PROBLEM, SETTLEMENT AND FAULTY ALUMINUM ENGINES.  I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS WITH THE HIGHLANDER AND SEE THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE 2002 HIGHLANDER.  THE SLUDGE SITUATION WOULD ONLY BE COVERED IF IT WAS WITHIN 8 YEARS OF THE PURCHASE DATE. WHAT ABOUT THE MANY CONSUMERS WHO STILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT IS PAST THE EIGHT YEARS? I BOUGHT THIS HIGHLANDER IN 2005, HAD IT SERVICED REGULARLY AND WE ALSO CHANGED THE OIL OURSELVES. IN 2008 I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR A TUNE UP AND AN OIL CHANGE PRIOR TO A LONG TRIP. ON THE WAY HOME, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WE PULLED OVER TO A LOCAL GAS STATION AND THERE WAS LITERALLY NO OIL IN MY ENGINE. TOYOTA DID THE OIL CHANGE BUT DID NOT PUT 5 QUARTS OF OIL INTO MY CAR FOR THIS LONG TRIP. WHEN I RETURNED I DID CONFRONT THE DEALERSHIP BUT THEY DENIED ANY WRONGDOING. WE HAVE, SINCE THAT TIME PERIOD HAD TO ADD OIL CONTINUOUSLY.  IT TURNS OUT THAT I WILL NEED TO REPLACE MY ENGINE FOR 4500.00.  *TR",

ONCE THAT I SAW THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED OKAY, I PROCEEDED INTO MY VEHICLE AND PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE WHEN I STEPPED ON THE GAS THE CAR JUST REVVED AND IT STAYED INTO POSITION, I KEPT CHANGING GEARS NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS WRONG AND AS I CHANGED INTO DRIVE AND STEPPED ON THE GAS, MY CAR QUICKLY SHIFTED AND ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME THEN IT STOPPED AGAIN. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A AUTOMECHANIC SHOP ON THE CORNER, SOMEONE FROM THE SHOP CAME TO WHERE I WAS TO LOOK AT MY CAR. THE MECHANIC DID THE SAME AS I DID, SHIFT GEARS AND THE CAR WOULD JERK SPONTANEOUSLY BACK THEN FORTH BUT WOULD NOT DRIVE. THE MECHANICS PUSHED IT INTO THE GARAGE AND INSPECTED TO FIND THAT MY TRANSMISSION WA GONE AT 68,000 MILES. I HAVE MY CAR CHECKED OFTEN, FLUIDS REPLACED WHEN NEED BE. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A TRANSMISSION CAN JUST DIE AT 68,000 MILES. I CALLED TOYOTA BECAUSE I HAVE MY CAR SERVICED AT TOYOTA. AND BECAUSE MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED IN 2008 , THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY CAN DO BUT PUT IN A NEW TRANSMISSION. I HAVE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO 3 LOCATIONS TO MAKE SURE I HAD SEVERAL OPINIONS AND THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS BAD.

THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE 2004, AT ABOUT 43000 MILES, WHEN I FIRST TOOK IT TO A LOCAL DEALER MECHANIC. IT IS NOW 2009, 111000 MILES LATER, AND AGAIN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON  QUEUE. ORIGINALLY, THE DEALER MECHANICS TOLD ME THEY HAD CORRECTED IT PRIOR TO MY WARRANTY EXPIRING. WHEN MY WARRANTY EXPIRED, THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO GET AN OVERHAUL ON MY CATALYTIC/EXHAUST SYSTEM, WHICH WAS QUOTED TO COST ABOUT $5000 TO FIX! I BELIEVE MY CAR WAS WORTH NO MORE THAN $7000 AT THE TIME. AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CATALYTIC SYSTEM AND THAT THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE DETECTION SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN SHOWN HOW TO RESET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BY THE TOYOTA DEALER PERSONNEL, I SUSPECT, BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING TO OTHER HIGHLANDER OWNERS. I AM BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP NOW BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A RECALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED YEARS AGO. I HOPE SOMEONE FROM TOYOTA WILL RECOGNIZE AND FIX THIS ISSUE. *TR",

THIS WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT PART. THE DEALERSHIP THAT I WENT TO SAID THEY HAVE SEEN A FEW VEHICLES. THE OWNERS I TALKED TO OWNED HIGHLANDERS,4 RUNNERS, AND MINIVANS. MY WIFE'S HIGHLANDER IS A 200, 2 THE OTHER VEHICLES RANGE FROM 2002 TO 2004, FOR AS I KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING REPORTED ABOUT THIS. I SENT AN EMAIL TO TOYOTA AND ALL I GOT BACK WAS THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY RECALLS FOR THAT. THE PROBLEM WITH MY WIFE'S HIGHLANDER WAS THAT THE HEAT STOPPED WORKING DURING THE WINTER. THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WAS TO KEEP TURNING THE KNOB UNTIL IT WOULD START BLOWING WARM AIR, BUT IT WOULD NOT DO IT FOR LONG. THE A/C WORKED FINE ,BUT WHEN WINTER RETURNED, THERE WAS NO HEAT. IF THE WAS A CONTINUING PROBLEM, AND MORE DEALERS FOUND OUT ABOUT, WHY WEREN'T THEY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF ONE COULD RESEARCH THIS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS THE FRONT DOOR HANDLE BROKE, IT WAS UNDERWARRANTY AND I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF IT, IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR 2005, THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR HANDLE BROKE AND AGAIN I DID NOT THINK  MUCH OF IT.  THREE WEEKS AGO ON SUNDAY ONE OF THE MEMBER FROM THE CHURCH WAS ATTEMPTING TO RETREIVE HIS BAG AND THE HANDLE BROKE.  WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALER SHIP TO ASK ABOUT REPAIR THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT WOULD BE $300.00, AND 200.00 TO FIX THE PASSANGER SIDE. MY COMMENT TO THEM WAS CONCERNING THE REAR DOOR, WHICH I HAD NOT USED THAT MUCH AND OVER THE LAST 6 MONTH MAYBE 3 TIME AT THE MOST PER WEEK, CERTAINLY NOT ALOT.  WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME WAS THAT THE DOOR HANDLE MECHANISM IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND SO IS THE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE. MY CONCERN AS A CONSUMER THAT TOYOTA DID NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE TO USE A PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE AND MECHANISM AND GIVEN THAT THINGS BREAK SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF 300.00 TO REPLACE.  I CONTEND THAT METAL PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF THE HANDLES.  CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE MERCY OF CAR MANUFACTURES TO PUT ANYTHING INTO A CAR THAT WOULD UTIMATELY WOULD PROVE NOT IN THE CONSUMERS BEST INTEREST.  I AM SUGGESTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL TOYOTA' DOOR HANDLES.  PARTICULARLY THE TRUCK WHICH BY DESIGN ARE SUPPOSE TO ENDURE TOUGH USESAGE.",

I HAVE CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF CERRITOS, CROWN TOYOTA'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, TOYOTA REGIONAL OFFICE CASE NO. 200201160431, AND FOLLOWED THE ARBITRATION PROCESS.  THEY ADVISED US THAT THIS IS A NORMAL CONDITION OF THE TOYOTA HIGHLANDER DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE DRIVEN MANY SUV'S LIKE THE DODGE DURANGO, FORD EXPEDITION AND CHEVY TAHOE'S.
