SINCE THE DAY OF THE REPAIR THE LID ON TOP LEFT SIDE OF THE DASHBOARD HAD POPPEDUP AND DID NOT CLOSE FULLY. THAT IS WHERE THE PASSENGER'S AIRBAG IN THE UPPER LEFT OF THE DASHBOARD IS LOCATED.I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST A COSMETIC ISSUE THAT COULD BE IGNORED. THE CAR STARTEDMAKING INTERMITTENTNOISES SIMILAR TO A CLOCK SOUND SHORTLY THEREAFTER. I HAVE RARELY DRIVEN THE CAR DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SINCE THE REPAIR WAS DONE. BUT RECENTLY THE NOISE HAS BECOME STEADY. I HAD MY MECHANIC WHO SPECIALIZES IN TOYOTA CARS CHECK THE CAR IN APRIL 2021. MY MECHANIC HAPPENS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE TAKATA AIRBAG ISSUE. HE SAYS THAT THE AIRBAG REPAIR DONE ON THE CAR IN 2020 IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE NOISE. THAT IS TO SAY MY CAR WAS MESSED UP AS A RESULT OF THIS SO CALLED RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER NOW REFUSES TO CHECK THE CAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE RECALL REPAIR HAS BEEN DONE CORRECTLY.",

I  REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS JOKING, UNTIL I GOT INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT MYSELF AND TRIED TO BUCKLE IT.  THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO BUCKLE THE BELT INTO.  I KNOW THAT THINGS BREAK ON AN AUTOMOBILE BUT THE SEAT BELTS ARE SOMETHING THAT YOU HOPE YOU CAN TRUST WHEN YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON THEM. THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS PROBLEM KNOWN WITH THIS BELT LATCH, AND AS A SINGLE PERSON WITH NO CHILDREN, THE PASSENGER BELT IS NOT EVEN USED FREQUENTLY.  FORTUNATELY, WE DID NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT DURING THIS 3,000 MILE VACATION, BUT ANYONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WAS WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF A SEATBELT.  I AM GETTING READY TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP AND/OR CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER TO SEE IF THEY WILL FIX THIS.  I AM SURE THEY WILL FIX IT BUT AT MY EXPENSE.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE SAFETY PROBLEM.   A MINIMUM CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE THAT I COULD RECEIVE A TICKET FROM POLICE FOR THE PASSENGER NOT USING THE SEATBELT AND THE WORST CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE THAT THE UNBELTED PASSENGER COULD BE KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT.  THIS DEFECT IS WORTHY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION!  *TR",

I HAD THEM REPLACE THE TANK WITH A USED TANK AND TOOK THE ROTTING TANK HOME WITH THE THOUGHT OF PLACING A COMPLAINT WITH GM. THE REPAIR SHOP SAID THE ROTTING WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL ON A TANK THAT WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD. GM REFUSED TO LOOK AT THE TANK AND OFFERED OIL CHANGES, SAYING THIS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE WINTER CONDITIONS THAT WE DRIVE IN. MY 2 YEAR OLDER AZTEK SITS NEXT TO IT IN THE GARAGE AND TANK LOOKS MUCH BETTER.  *TR",

IT IS SUPPOSE TO GO BACK TO AN OPEN POSITION WHEN THE DOOR TOUCHES A PERSON OR AN OBJECT.  OUR CONCERN IS IT TAKES ALL OF MY BODY WEIGHT FOR THIS DOOR TO GO BACK.  SO IF OR WHEN A CHILD MIGHT GET HIS ARM OR EVEN HEAD IN BETWEEN THE FRAME AND THE DOOR CLOSING IF HE WERE STARTING TO GET OUT OF THE VAN IT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY SINCE THE DOOR WOULD NOT JUST GO BACK AS IT SHOULD.  OUR GRANDSON DID GET HIS FINGERS/HAND CAUGHT IN IT AND THE BUTTON HAD TO BE PUSHED TO RELEASE HIM.  THE MANUFACTURER SAYS THIS IS NORMAL.  IT IS NOT WHEN THE CHRYSLER VANS WHICH MY NIECE OWNS HAS THE SAME TYPE SET UP AND WHEN YOU JUST TOUCH HER DOOR AS IT'S CLOSING IT GOES RIGHT BACK OPEN.  WE REALLY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE THIS COULD CAUSE A CHILD.  I WAS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TO SOME FRIENDS WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE VAN HOW THE DOOR WOULD GO BACK NOT KNOWING IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE DOOR FOR IT TO GO BACK AND IT BRUISED MY ARM.  THE WAY THIS DOOR WORKS NOW WE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MONTANA UNLESS THIS FEATURE IS CORRECTED.  WE WOULD DEFINITELY GO TO A CHRYSLER VAN NEXT.  THEIRS IS MUCH SAFER.  WE HAVE 8 GRANDCHILDREN AND THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN EVERYTIME THEY GO WITH US IN THE CAR.  *NM",

WHEN THE CLUTCH PEDAL IS DEPRESSED, THE GRINDING/RATTLING NOISE GOES AWAY. THE NOISE CAN BE REPLICATED BY KEEPING THE ENGINE SPEED AT 1600 RPM'S      I SENT A FAX TO THE SERVICE MANAGER OF PARKS AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC ON 09/23/2003 DESCRIBING THE GEARBOX PROBLEM IN DETAIL AND I SPOKE WITH HIM VIA THE TELEPHONE. HE ASSURED ME THE PROBLEM WOULD BE ADDRESSED. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO PARKS AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC ON 09/24/2003 AT 0740 HOURS. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 0945 HOURS CONTACTED ME AND THEY STATED THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM AND IT WAS FIXED. THE SERVICE REP STATED THE PROBLEM WAS WITH A LOOSE CLIP. THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THEY FOUND CARGO FASTNER CLIPS IN THE REAR CARGO AREA THAT WERE THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE. THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THEY HEARD THE NOISE FROM THE GEARBOX WHEN THE CAR WAS IN NEUTRAL AND IT WAS NORMAL. THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THE VEHICLE WAS TEST DRIVEN BY TWO PEOPLE AFTER THE CARGO FASTNER CLIPS WERE REMOVED AND THE NOISE WAS GONE. I SPOKE WITH A PONTIAC CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTIVE ON 09/25/2003. THE SERVICE REP CONTACTED THE SERVICE MANAGER IN REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THE SAME DIAGNOSIS. THE SERVICE REP AGREED WITH ME THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS NOT LOGICAL FOR A NOISE COMING FROM THE GEARBOX. THE NOISE WAS NOT CAUSED BY CARGO FASTNER CLIPS LOCATED IN THE TRUNK. IN REGARDS TO THE CARGO FASTNER CLIPS THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED SINCE SEPTEMBER 2002; THE CLIPS SCREW INTO A RAIL ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRUNK AND COME WITH STRAPS TO SECURE CARGO IN THE TRUNK.    SINCE PICKING UP THE VEHICLE FROM PARKS AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC ON 09/24/2003, THE NOISE FROM THE GEARBOX STILL EXISTS AND NOTHING WAS REPAIRED BY THE DEALERSHIP.",
