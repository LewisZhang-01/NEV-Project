PRESUMABLY THE HEADREST RECALL I BROUGHT IT INTO KOONS IN MANASSAS, VA AS A SECOND AFTERTHOUGHT TO THE WHEEL SENSOR RECALL WAS THE ONLY THING THEY ENDED UP DOING OTHER THAN GIVING ME AN ESTIMATE FOR OVER $3300 FOR WORK THAT HAS NEVER NEEDED TO BE DONE.  MY UNANSWERED QUESTION TO GM CORPORATE WAS \"I'S THIS HOW YOUR GOING TO HANDLE THE IGNITION RECALLS?\" ADDITIONALLY, GM CLAIMS TO BE UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER MY IGNITION SWITCH IS THE SAME IN DESIGN AS ANY OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  DO AMERICANS CITIZENS NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT LEAST THAT MUCH \"PROPRIETARY\"-PROTECTED INFORMATION FROM GM?  GM CORPORATE'S SPECIALIST CLAIMED TO OBJECT TO MY MENTIONING THAT I, TOO, MIGHT RECORD THE CALL.  KOONS ALSO NEVER NOTICED THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD BROKEN OUT THE ABS LIGHT BECAUSE PRIOR TO THE RECALL (WHICH SHOULD HAVE LATER TIPPED ME OFF THAT THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY CLEAN THE WHEEL SENSOR AND CHECK THE ABS LIGHT SINCE IT WAS NOT ON THE $3300 ESTIMATE OF NECESSARY REPAIRS), BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY KNEW THEN WHY THE ABS LIGHT WOULD STAY ON.

NO ONE WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AT THE TIME, AND THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS INJURED, HOWEVER I AM INCREDIBLY WORRIED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE VEHICLES SAFETY. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS, AND MY INFANT SON SITS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PASSENGER SEAT IN A REAR FACING CAR SEAT. NOT ONLY WOULD THE INCREDIBLY LOUD 'GUNSHOT' SOUND HAVE POSSIBLY DAMAGED HIS EARS, BUT THE SMOKY AFTERMATH THE CAR WAS FILLED WITH WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR BOTH CHILDREN'S LUNGS.  AIRBAGS ARE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE THAT IS UNPARALLELED WHEN THEY OPERATE CORRECTLY. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS FAULTY WIRING OR SENSORS IN THIS MODEL  SUV FOR THE SIDE SEAT AIRBAG TO GO OFF NOT ONLY WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, BUT WHEN THE CAR WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP. MY CONCERN IS WITH THE REST OF THE VEHICLES AIRBAG SENSORS, BECAUSE I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SPONTANEOUSLY GO OFF WHILE I AM DRIVING.  WE  CONTACTED OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP WITH THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED, HOWEVER IT WAS A SUNDAY AND WE WERE TOLD NO ONE WAS AVAILABLE TO HELP US. A VEHICLE INSPECTION WAS SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY, THE 21ST, AND MY HUSBAND RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE INSPECTOR LATER THAT NIGHT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INCIDENT. WE WERE TOLD BY THE INSPECTOR THAT WE WOULD BE RECEIVING A CALL FROM GMC WITH THE DETAILS AND OUTCOME OF THE INSPECTION. IT IS NOW THURSDAY THE 23RD, AND EVEN AFTER TWO PHONE CALLS I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE. I HAVE NOW BEEN WITHOUT A VEHICLE FOR TWELVE DAYS, AND STILL CANNOT DRIVE IT BECAUSE I AM NOT COMFORTABLE TRANSPORTING MY CHILDREN.

INTRIGUED BY THE PROBLEM I EXPERIMENTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTERMITTENT PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE, FOR SAFETY REASONS, DEFEATING THE ABS BY REMOVING THE FUSE THAT POWERS THE CONTROL MODULE.  AS I HAVE NOW DISCOVERED, ACTIVATION OF THE ABS TO LOW SPEEDS CONTINUES TO BE A RELATIVELY COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM LIGHT TRUCKS OF THE 2000 MODEL YEAR AND NEWER.  INDEED MY VEHICLE WAS RECALLED IN DECEMBER, 2005 TO SUPPOSEDLY PROVIDE A \"FIX\" SO THAT THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT OCCUR.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A GM ENGINEER (MAYBE A MARKETING PERSON IN REALITY) WHO TOLD ME SOME NONSENSE ABOUT THIS NOT BEING A RECURRENCE OF THE SENSOR PROBLEM.  ACTUALLY IT WAS THE CONVERSATION WITH THE ENGINEER THAT LEAD TO MAKING THIS COMPLAINT.  I AM NOT SO UPSET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM FAILED, FAILURE DO OCCUR, THE PROBLEM IS WITH HOW THE SYSTEM REACTED IN FAILURE.  I WORK ON VEHICLE SENSOR SYSTEMS (SUSPENSIONS AND FLUID DIAGNOSTICS) AND A MAJOR DESIGN CONSTRAINT FOR ANY SYSTEM  IS THAT ANY FAILURE MODE CANNOT NOT LEAD TO AN UNSAFE CONDITION.

THE FOLLOWING IS AN EMAIL THAT I RECEIVED FROM GMC:      VEHICLES OF A MODEL YEAR ARE AFFECTED.      THERE IS AN UPCOMING RECALL 05068 FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSOR- DESCRIPTION: ABS WHEEL SENSORS. GENERAL MOTORS WILL NOTIFY ALL OWNERS OF INVOLVED VEHICLES BEGINNING 10/12/2005. PLEASE MAKE SURE THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR DIVISIONS (DMV) HAS YOUR CURRENT INFORMATION FOR MAILING PURPOSES IN CASE YOUR VEHICLE IS INVOLVED IN THE RECALL.

DESCRIPTION OF CONDITION: SOME OF THE SUBJECT VEHICLES MAY EXPERIENCE EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH UNWANTED ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) ACTIVATION DURING LOW-SPEED BRAKE APPLICATIONS (LESS THAN 10 MPH AND GREATER THAN 3.7 MPH). THIS CONDITION DOES NOT SET ANY ABS CODES NOR DOES IT ILLUMINATE THE ABS WARNING LAMP. THIS CONDITION IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ENVIRONMENTALLY CORROSIVE AREAS, BASED ON FIELD REPORT DATA.  CONSEQUENCE OF CONDITION: WHEN THE PEAK-TO-PEAK WHEEL SPEED SENSOR VOLTAGE LEVEL RECEIVED AT THE ABS CONTROLLER IS BELOW THE MINIMUM SPECIFIED PEAK-TO-PEAK LEVEL, THE ABS CONTROLLER INTERPRETS THIS AS A WHEEL SPEED THAT IS LESS THAN THE ACTUAL WHEEL SPEED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE ABS INTERPRETS THE WHEEL AS SLIPPING WHEN IT IS NOT. IF THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, AN EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCE MAY BE REQUIRED.  *JB",

HAD TO LEAVE THE BOAT WHERE IT WAS, AND WAS HAPPY THE PROBLEM DIDN'T OCCUR WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY FAMILY.  TESTED THE VEHICLE TO MAKE SURE I COULD STEER AND STOP IT UNDER CAREFUL CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN DROVE IT DIRECTLY, SLOWLY, AND CAREFULLY TO THE DEALER ABOUT 50 MILES.  MY OWN INVESTIGATION FOUND A RECALL ID NUMBER 05V005000:  \"HYDRAULIC PUMP DRIVESHAFT THAT CAN FRACTURE, RESULTING IN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING ASSIST.

THOUGH I GOT NO INITIAL HELP FROM THE DEALERSHIP, I CALLED THE GMC RECALL 800 NUMBER AND THEY DIRECTED ME BACK TO THE DEALERS GENERAL MANAGER AND SAID I SHOULD HAVE HIM SPEAK TO THE GM REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT COMPENSATION IN MY CASE.  I DID THAT, AND AT LEAST THEY DID COVER THE COST OF THE PART (ABOUT $500), BUT NOT THE LABOR OF $193 TO REPLACE THE PUMP.  I ASKED TO KEEP THE OLD PUMP AND WAS TOLD THAT I COULD, BUT WAS NOT GIVEN THE PUMP OR AN EXPLANATION WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP.  THE RECEIPT FROM THE DEALER SEEMS TO INDICATE A \"CORE RETURN\" UNDER PARTS, SO I GUESS I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY TO KEEP THE OLD PART AND NOT RETURN IT.

THE DEALER MAINTAINED THAT I MUST BE DRIVING WITH THE PARKING BRAKE ENGAGED. I MAINTAINED THAT WAS NOT TRUE, THAT THERE MUST BE A DESIGN FLAW WITH SOME OF THE BRAKE COMPONENTS CAUSING THE UNINTENDED ENGAGING OF THE PARKING BRAKE SHOE AND THE DRUM.

MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE BRAKE SHOE LINER COULD EVENTUALLY WEAR OUT THE DRUM AND POSSIBLE CAUSE A CRASH. HOWEVER, I AM NOT ABLE TO STOP DRIVING THE CAR.  SUBSEQUENTLY, AFTER RESEARCHING THE NHTSA SITE, I FOUND GMC'S SERVICE BULLETIN, NHTSA # 10000172 DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM AND THE RECOMMENDED FIX, WHICH WAS REPLACING A PART WITH A \"NEWLY DESIGNED PART ( A TENSION SPRING)! THE SERVICE BULLETIN DID NOT STATE THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY DRIVERS DRIVING THEIR CARS WITH THEIR PARKING BRAKE ENGAGED. I BELIEVE THAT ENOUGH OWNERS COMPLAINED AND GMC REALIZED THAT IT WAS A DESIGN PROBLEM. THE BULLENTIN COVERS SERVAL GM MODELS.  AGAIN, THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE NOISE CAUSED BY THE SCRAPING, BUT THE POTENTIAL ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THE BRAKE SHOE LINER EVENTUALLY WEARING THRU THE PARKING BRAKE DRUM POSSIBLE CAUSING THE ROTOR TO SEPERATE. THIS COULD HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. A LOSS OF CONTROL OR SUDDEN STOP PROBABLY WOULD TAKE PLACE. I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY SERIOUS AND NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.",

MY VEHICLE HAS 46000 MILES, I HAVE HAD THE BRAKES REPAIRED BY A NON-GM FACILITY, WITH GOOD RESULTS.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THERE WAS EVIDENCE THE BRAKES WERE SERIOUSLY OUT OF ADJUSTMENT, AND HAD WEAR PATTERNS WHICH WOULD INDICATE A CAUSE OTHER THAN MY DRIVING WITH THE BRAKE ON.  I PLAN TO MEET WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER FOR MY DEALER AND DISCUSS THIS MATTER FURTHER.
