        "summary": "I was driving to work with my son and sister in the car when the steering wheel suddenly got very tight and started jerking when I attempted to make a left or right turn. I then stopped at a gas station and as soon as I came to a complete stop the vehicle shut off before I could turn it off manually. I then attempted to turn the key on and start the vehicle but it would not turn over, it would only make a clicking sound. I called a friend that was close by to come and assist me so when they arrived I asked them to jump my vehicle off via jumper cables which did get my vehicle's engine to finally start. The car sounded very weak as if it was going to shut off again once we disconnected the jumper cables but it didn't shut off. Nothing was working inside the car or outside meaning I had no radio, no interior lights and nothing on my dash was working. The speedometer wasn't working, the rims Guage wasn't working, the temp Guage wasn't working nor was anything else working on my dash. The turn signals were not working for either side and none of my headlights or taillights were working either. And I still did not safely have control of the steering. The only warning lamp, which didn't appear until my friend jumped my car off, was what looked like a symbol of a vehicle with a symbol of a locked lock in front of it. This failure just happened so I have not taken the car to a certified mechanic to inspect it but the car is available for inspection at any time. I can not afford to put my car in the shop, I work part time at a restaurant in my town and I'm also disabled and I also care for my 8 year old son who is severely autistic so I have no extra money to fix these problems. Please I need help.",

I HAD MY MECHANIC TAKE THE WHOLE SEAT OUT TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND HE SAID THAT THE FRAME HOLDING THE SEAT TO THE FLOOR HAD BROKEN IN 2 PLACES.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO FIX IT SAFELY FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  HE SAID THAT THE MATERIALS FOR THE FRAME WERE WEAK AND INADEQUATE.  HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WELD BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT POSSIBLY STARTING THE SEAT ON FIRE.  HE ALSO BROUGHT UP THE FACTS THAT IF A SEAT WASN'T SECURELY BOLTED TO THE FLOOR AND WAS LOOSE THAT IN A FRONT END CRASH THE SEAT WOULD THROW THE DRIVER FORWARD INTO THE WINDSHIELD.  THE AIR BAG \"MIGHT\" HELP SLIGHTLY.  OR - IF YOU WERE HIT FROM THE REAR WITH THE SEAT LOOSE THE SEAT WOULD COLLAPSE BACKWARD AND THROW THE DRIVER TO THE REAR OF THE CAR OR POSSIBLY THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD.  EITHER SITUATION COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO A DRIVER WITH THIS SITUATION.  MY MECHANIC SUGGESTED REPLACING THE WHOLE SEAT BUT WHY WOULD I SPEND THE POSSIBLE $900 AND END UP WITH A SEAT WITH THE SAME INADEQUATE, WEAK FRAME ONLY TO BREAK AGAIN.  THE SEAT BROKE BECAUSE OF CHEAP, WEAK, INADEQUATE MATERIALS THAT WERE USED.  IT DID NOT HAPPEN FROM WEAR AND TEAR OR ABUSE.  IT IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE THAT GM NEEDS TO RECALL AND FIX AT THEIR EXPENSE.  I HOPE OTHERS READING THIS COMPLAINT WILL PURSUE THIS ISSUE WITH GM UNTIL A RECALL HAPPENS, AND BEFORE ANY OF US ARE KILLED!",

I WAS DRIVING ON ROUTE 1 IN NEW JERSEY AND GOING ABOUT 45-50 MPH. I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND RESTARTED THE CAR, HOPING IT WAS JUST AN ELECTRONIC GLITCH. THAT SOLVED THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, I LEARNED READING THE NYTIMES THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE MAXX AND IN FACT THERE HAD BEEN A SAFETY RECALL ON THE CAR. I CALLED A LOCAL CHEVY DEALER TO HAVE IT FIXED AND FOUND THERE ARE THREE OUTSTANDING SAFETY RECALLS ON MY CAR. IN ADDITION TO THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM, THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION SHIFT CABLE AND THE BRAKE LAMP. ALL THESE RECALLS WERE MADE IN APRIL AND MAY OF LAST YEAR AFTER ALL THE BAD PUBLICITY ABOUT COVERING UP DEFECTS THAT RESULTED IN DEATHS.     I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THREE PROBLEMS, BUT THIS IS MY LARGER CONCERN: I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I RECEIVED ONLY ONE RECALL NOTICE (NOT THREE) AND THAT ONE NOTICE (WHICH WAS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION CABLE) SAID THAT THE PARTS WEREN'T AVAILABLE AND THEY WOULD NOTIFY ME WHEN THEY WERE AVAILABLE. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED, BUT APPARENTLY THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME.    MY QUESTION FOR YOU: WHAT IS NHTSA DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS RECEIVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT SAFETY RECALLS? I WAS LUCKY. I WAS DRIVING ON A STRAIGHT ROAD IN AN URBAN AREA -- AND NOT TAKING A CURVE ON A MOUNTAINSIDE -- WHEN MY POWER STEERING SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING. WHY WASN'T I TOLD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM EARLIER? WHY DID I HAVE TO WAIT TILL READING ABOUT IT IN THE NYTIMES? AND WHY DIDN'T I RECEIVE A FOLLOWUP LETTER WHEN THE PART BECAME AVAILABLE FOR THE TRANSMISSION CABLE?    THANK YOU. *TR",

WHEN I EXAMINED THE SEAT I DISCOVERED THAT THE WELDS ON THE FRONT CROSS-BAR AND THE REAR CROSS BAR WERE SEPARATED BETWEEN THE SEAT AND LOWER ADJUSTMENT FRAME, THIS CAUSES THE DRIVERS SEAT TO LEAN TOWARD THE CENTER CONSOLE AND REAR OF THE VEHICLE. UPON FIRST EXAMINATION I THOUGHT THE WELDS HAD BROKEN, BUT ON CLOSER EXAMINATION IT APPEARS THAT THE WELD DID NOT PENETRATE THE METAL FAR ENOUGH AS THE WELD AND BAR WERE BOTH INTACT, EXCEPT FOR SOME SUPERFICIAL SCARING ON THE TUBING.               THIS RESULTS IN A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM AS THE SEAT BELT IS ATTACHED TO THE SEAT AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DRIVERS SEAT, NOT TO THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE. SHOULD THIS VEHICLE BE INVOLVED IN A FRONTAL CRASH THESE BROKEN WELDS RENDER THE SEAT BELT INEFFECTIVE AT BEST OR USELESS, DEPENDING ON THE WEIGHT OF THE DRIVER. IF THE AIR BAGS DO NOT DEPLOY THE DRIVER WILL BE THROWN FOREWORD ALONG WITH THE SEAT WITH THE APPEARANCE THAT THE DRIVERS WEIGHT BROKE THE SEAT, WHEN IN-FACT THE SEAT WAS EITHER BROKEN ALREADY OR SEVERELY WEAKENED BY INADEQUATE WELDS.              A CURSORY ON LINE SEARCH REVEALED THAT THIS DEFECT EXISTS IN  THE CHEVY MALIBU, MONTA CARLO, PONTIAC GRAND PRIX, PONTIAC G6, SATURN AURA AND ION. MODEL YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2009. I CONTACTED GM REF#[XXX] AND AS WITH MANY OTHER ON LINE COMPLAINTS WERE TOLD IN ESSENCE TOO BAD OUT OF WARRANTY YOUR PROBLEM NOT OURS.  I AM FULLY CAPABLE OF WELDING THIS FRAME MY SELF, AND WILL DO SO HOWEVER, GM DEALERS CHARGE APP $1000. FOR THE REPAIR AND IF USING THE SAME STOCK FRAMES, WILL INSTALL A FAULTY FRAME.

AN NHTSA INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED PE04-031 BASED ON EIGHT REPORTS OF ALLEGED POWER STEERING FAILURES. THE PRELIMINARY EVALUATION HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS BASED ON THE REPORT I PRINTED UP IN 2010, HOWEVER I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT MORE FAILURE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN OPENED, THOUGH I CANNOT FIND A RECALL REGARDING THIS FAILURE. AS A SIDE NOTE, SOMETIMES THE CAR HAS TROUBLE STARTING - IT ALWAYS HAS AND THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT DETERMINE THE FAILURE. WHEN TRYING TO START IT UP, HITTING THE GAS PEDAL WILL CAUSE THE ENGINE TO KICK OVER AND NOT STALL. THERE IS ALWAYS THE SMELL OF FUEL. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS PART OF THE FAILURE.

THEY HAVE SINCE APPEARED ESPECIALLY IN WET WEATHER, WITH LOW RPMS (ABOUT 600) AND ON MAKING SLOW-SPEED RIGHT TURNS. MY NOT-YET-YEAR-OLD, 75-MONTH BATTERY ALSO JUST GAVE OUT, BUT REPLACING IT DID NOT STOP THE FAULT INDICATIONS. TURNING OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTING TO REBOOT THE SYSTEM USUALLY DID, BUT THE PROBLEM RECURRED.    TWO DAYS AGO, WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY, FAULT INDICATIONS WERE NOT DISPLAYED AND STEERING RESPONSE WAS NORMAL.  HOWEVER, ON NEGOTIATING AN S-SHAPED EXIT RAMP, THE POWER ASSIST FAILED AND THE INDICATORS CAME ON.  STEERING BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND I ONLY MANAGED TO STAY ON THE ROAD AT THE EXPENSE OF A WRENCHED SHOULDER.    THE 2004 MALIBU HAS AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING ASSIST SYSTEM (EPS) - WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF NHTSA ACTION NUMBER EA4018. THE DOOR STICKER ON MY CAR SHOWS A MANUFACTURE DATE OF 5/04. SO, ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT, THE \"NEWLY DESIGNED TORQUE AND POSITION SENSOR\" IN VEHICLES PRODUCED AFTER 2/4/04, SHOULD HAVE BEEN INSTALLED. (I'LL BE EMAILING GM TO CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE.)  IN ANY EVENT, JUDGING BY THE SPATE OF COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER MALIBU OWNERS, IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED'OR THAT GM HAS EVEN CARED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK INTO IT.  PLEASE SEE CAR COMPLAINTS LINK FOR A SAMPLING: HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CHEVROLET/MALIBU/2004/STEERING/POWER_STEERING_GOING_OUT_INTERMITTENTLY.SHTML    I ALSO TAKE ISSUE WITH YOUR REPORT THAT DRIVER IMPACT WOULD BE INSUBSTANTIAL AS THE CAR IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND LIGHT.  BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, THERE IS A CLEAR SAFELY HAZARD.  THE MALIBU OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A CAR FOR 20-SOMETHINGS. PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DRIVE IT WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO STEER WITHOUT THE POWER ASSIST TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.    AS ALLUDED TO AT THE END OF YOUR REPORT, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES NOW WARRANT FURTHER ACTION. *TR",

TOOK IN TO DEALER AND HAD A DIAGNOSTIC TEST RUN ($100.00).  TEST INDICATES THAT I NEED THE STEERING COLUMN REPLACED AND A SHAFT KIT (CLUNKING) COST $990.65, NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALS THAT THIS STEERING COLUMN DEFECT IS NOT UNCOMMON AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BY THE MANUFACTURER!

WITH GREAT EFFORT I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. IT IS MY OPINION THAT HAD MY GIRL FRIEND OR AN ELDERLY PERSON BEEN DRIVING THAT THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL ONE. USING SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH I WAS ABLE TO STEER TO A SAFE AREA. I REVIEWED THE OWNER'S MANUAL WHICH ADVISED GOING TO THE DEALER. AFTER ABOUT 12 MINUTES, I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL. I THEN DROVE TO THE DEALER (BANKS CHEVROLET IN CONCORD, NH) FROM WHOM I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND RECOUNTED THE EXPERIENCE TO THEM. THEY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE AND ASSIGNED A TECHNICIAN TO OBTAIN THE (OBD-II) ERROR CODES, IF ANY HAD BEEN RECORDED. THE READOUT OBTAINED WAS CODE 545, WHICH THEY RESEARCHED AND, ALTHOUGH IT DID PERTAIN TO THE POWER STEERING, IT REFERRED TO AN \"INTERMITTENT\" LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST, NOT A FULL AND CONTINUOUS LOSS. SINCE IT WAS NEARING CLOSING TIME, AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY, 3/4/10. ON THAT DATE, THE BANKS TECHNICIAN (JIM WATHEN) RESEARCHED THE ISSUE FURTHER AND MADE SOME ELECTRICAL ADJUSTMENTS. THE VEHICLE HAS PERFORMED NORMALLY SINCE.  I AM REPORTING THIS HEART-STOPPING EVENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE A FAIL-SAFE STEERING SYSTEM. I HOLD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE AND A LOT OF OUR TRAINING, BOTH IN AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS, IS DEDICATED TO THE PROPER RESPONSE TO A TOTAL FAILURE IN THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. THIS EVENT REQUIRED MORE STRENGTH THAN ANY I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN AVIATION AND DECIDEDLY COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL, ESPECIALLY IF THE ROAD CONDITIONS WERE SLIPPERY OR THE ROADWAY ITSELF TWISTY (AS IN THE MOUNTAINS).

THE FAILURE HAPPENED SUDDENLY WHILE DRIVING MY 2 SPECIAL NEEDS BOYS TO SCHOOL. THE FAILURE STARTED WITH LITTLE WARNING IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL WHICH IS LOCATED RIGHT OFF THE BOULEVARD.  I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE CAR SAFELY TO A STOP DUE TO THE 25MPH SCHOOL ZONE RULE.  THE MAXIMUM SPEED LIMIT IS 35 DURING NON SCHOOL HOURS AND 40 MPH FURTHER DOWN THE BOULEVARD. THE POWER STEERING BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER WITH IN SECONDS BEFORE THE SERVICE (WRENCH) LIGHT CAME ON. I PARKED MY VEHICLE, AND CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED TO AN REPUTABLE CARE REPAIR SHOP BECAUSE THE CAR WASN'T SAFE FOR ME TO DRIVE. AFTER 50 MINUTES THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED AND WHEN THE DRIVER STARTED MY CAR, THE CAR WAS AGAIN STEER-ABLE AND THE MAINTENANCE LIGHT WAS NO LONGER ON. THE MECHANICS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN REPRODUCING THE STEERING MALFUNCTION. SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2009 , THE SAME FAILURE REPEATED ITSELF, SAME LOCATION SAME TIME AS BEFORE, THE MAINTENANCE LIGHT TURNED ON AND THEN UNLIKE THE FIRST EVENT ON SEPTEMBER 8TH, THE RADIO DISPLAYED AN POWERSTEERING FAILURE MESSAGE ON ITS' SCREEN. THE MECHANIC AT THE AUTO SHOP TOOK A LOOK AT MY CAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE SAW THE MAINTENANCE LIGHT, AND THE POWERSTEERING FAILURE MESSAGE. AFTER THE POWERSTEERING PART FROM BOB STALL CHEVROLET WAS DELIVERED, THE PART WAS THEN INSTALLED. I PAID OUT OF POCKET, AND DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL AFTER SERVICE WAS RENDERED, THAT A DISCOVERY WAS MADE BY THE SHOP WHILE SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT MY CAR, THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL. I NEVER RECEIVED GM'S NOTICE. I HAVE THE OLD PART. PART INSTALLED IS NEW. *TR",

I PAID FOR THE REPAIRS, BUT I IMMEDIATELY CALLED GENERAL MOTORS, AND TOLD SOME ONE THERE THAT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO BE CHARGED FOR A REPAIR ON SOMETHING IN THE VEHICLE THAT WAS KNOWN TO BE DEFECTIVE.  THAT OFFICE THEN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO THE MANAGER AND THEY REIMBURSED ME FOR THE REPAIR.  WELL, NOW THE STEERING  WAS ACTING UP AGAIN.  THIS TIME THE VEHICLE PULLED STRONGLY TO THE LEFT WHEN BEING DRIVEN.  IT ALSO MADE A STRANGE NOISE WHEN TURNING THE WHEEL, SIMILAR TO THE ONE IT MADE PREVIOUSLY WHEN REPAIRS HAD TO BE DONE. I  HAD THE VEHICLE CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES ,AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  TOMORROW I AM GOING TO ASK THEM TO CHECK INTO THE ACTUAL STEERING MECHANISM TO SEE IF THAT WAS WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS COMING FROM.

THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN MAY OF 2004 AT DELPHI'S PLANT 1, EPS ASSEMBLY. THE STUDY INCLUDED TEN PRODUCTION MOTOR AND TEN PRODUCTION CONTROLLER ASSEMBLIES THAT WERE ASSEMBLED ON THE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS(ES). THE CONTROLLER IS ATTACHED TO MOTOR BY THREE M 5.0X 0.8 SCREWS. THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY CONCLUDED THAT FOUR OF THE TEN MOTOR/CONTROLLER ASSEMBLIES HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE SCREWS FULLY STRIPPED WITH LESS THAN 50% OF THE DESIGN INTENDED RETENTION AND WITH TWO ASSEMBLIES WITH TWO FULLY STRIPPED SCREWS. THIS REPORT WAS SHARED WITH MY IMMEDIATE ENGINEERING MANAGER WHOM THEN REPORTED TO SEVERAL OTHER PRODUCT ENGINEER MANAGERS OF THE EPS GROUP IN SAGINAW, MICHIGAN. IT WAS UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT PLANT 1 HAD AN ASSEMBLY ISSUE WITH THIS PROCESS AND THAT THERE WAS NO EFFECTIVE CONTAINMENT PROCESS IN PLACE TO SCRAP ALL SUSPECTED STRIPPED ASSEMBLIES.

THIS VIBRATION / MOVEMENT DID NOT ACTUALLY MOVE THE WHEELS, AND SHE RETURNED HOME SAFELY.THE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT, BUT ONE MORNING AS SHE PREPARED TO LEAVE, SHE NOTICED THE VIBRATION PROBLEM AGAIN, AND WISHING TO SHOW IT TO ME, CALLED ME TO THE GARAGE.  I WITNESSED THE PALSY-LIKE MOVEMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND AGAIN NOTED THAT THE TIRES DIDN'T MOVE WITH THE WHEEL.    AFTER THIS OCCURRED, I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE (MAKING A NOTE TO MYSELF FOR OUR NEXT VISIT TO THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT).  LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES LATER, I HEARD A KNOCK AT THE DOOR, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE MY 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER (WHO HAD GONE WITH MY WIFE).  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE STEERING HAD \"BROKEN\" AND THAT MY WIFE WAS TRYING TO MANEUVER THE CAR BACK TO THE HOUSE.  I WENT OUT TO THE END OF THE DRIVE, TO FIND MY WIFE ATTEMPTING TO FIGHT TO GET THE CAR BACK ONTO OUR STREET.  I STOPPED HER, TOOK OVER THE CAR, TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, THEN RESTARTED THE CAR.  THIS RESTORED THE POWER STEERING, AT WHICH POINT I PARKED THE CAR IN THE GARAGE, AND THE WIFE TOOK OUR OTHER VEHICLE.    I HAD ALREADY READ OF THIS ISSUE ON SEVERAL BULLETIN BOARDS AROUND THE WEB, AND MY CAR IS A RELATIVELY EARLY 2004 BUILD MALIBU.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS AS YET BEEN NO OFFICIAL RECALL FROM CHEVROLET, AND AS I SEE THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA INTO THIS ISSUE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT YET ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE SAME PROBLEM AS WAS EXPERIENCED BY THE OTHER 8 DRIVERS MENTIONED BY THE INVESTIGATION.  I CONSIDER THE TWITCHING STEERING WHEEL TO BE A SINGLE FAILURE, AND COMBINED WITH THE ACTUAL LOSS OF POWER ASSIST ONCE SO FAR, HAVE INDICATED 2 FAILURES.

WHEN YOU TURN EITHER DIRECTION THE CAR WILL CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION UNLESS YOU MANUALLY TURN IT TO CENTER YOUR SELF.  THE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT IT COULD BE ONE OF TWO THINGS 1) THE CONTOUR OF THE ROAD, 2) HOW THE CAR WAS TIED DOWN ON THE DELIVER TRUCK THAT HAS CAUSED THE ALIGNMENT TO BE OUT OF WACK.  IF THE SECOND RESPONSE IS TRUE THEN WAIT FOR 500 MILES, IF THE STEERING DOESN'T CHANGE THEN THEY WILL PERFORM A ALL WHEEL ALIGNMENT ON IT.  WELL 500 MILES CAME AND WENT AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE STEERING.  THE ADVISOR SAYS THE THE HEAD TECHNICIAN STATED DUE TO THE STEERING BEING ELECTRICAL THAT IS HOW IT WILL DRIVE, IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.  I DIDN'T LIKE THAT RESPONSE SO I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND HE SUGGESTED THAT I TEST DRIVE ANOTHER VEHICLE TO SEE IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE.  I DID THAT AND THE NEWER VEHICLE DROVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN MINE BUT THE ADVISOR REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER THE STEERING LOCKED UP WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 65 MILES PER HOUR. I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO POWER TO THE STEERING.  FORTUNATELY I WAS ON MY WAY TO ANOTHER DEARLERSHIP AND THEY CHECKED IT OUT FOR ME BUT ONCE YOU TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND ON AGAIN THE POWER CAME BACK.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD THE MAINTENANCE LIGHT COME ON FOR SERVICE.  IT HAS BEEN CHECKED OUT AND SERVICED.  THE STEERING IS STILL RETURNING TO CENTER AFTER DIRECTIONAL TURNS.  PE04031_CAT.  *AK",
