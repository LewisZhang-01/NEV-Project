THE SPARE TIRE WINCH ASSEMBLY WAS A BLOCK OF RUST AND THE SHEET METAL THAT MADE UP THE HOLDER THAT THE CARRIER WAS ATTACHED TO IS SO SEVERELY ROTTED THAT IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY EVEN HOLD A TIRE. THE SHEET METAL MENTIONED IS A STRUCTURAL PART OF THE REAR FRAME AND IT HAS MAJOR ROT AND SHOULD PROBABLY BE REPLACED. MY SON NEEDED A SPARE TIRE SO SINCE THERE WAS NO HOLDER HE PUT IT IN THE BED. WHEN HE PUT IT IN THE BED IN BOUNCED TO THE RIGHT AND PUT A LARGE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE BED JUST BEHIND THE CAB. WE STARTED TO CHECK OUT THE REST OF THE BED ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS SO RUSTED THAT IT WAS LITERALLY STATING TO CRUMBLE IN SPOTS. WHILE CHECKING IT OUT WE PUT SEVERAL MORE HOLES IN THE FLOOR OF THE BED AND THE SIDES JUST BY POKING AROUND WITH A SCREWDRIVER. THE BED IS A STEPSIDE AND THERE IS NO METAL LEFT UNDER THE STEPS AT ALL, IF YOU WERE TO STEP ON EITHER SIDE YOU WOULD CRACK THE FIBERGLASS SIDES. WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING TO REPLACE THE BED. ALL OF THE BOLTS HAD TO BE CUT OUT DUE TO THE RUST. ONCE WE GOT THE BED OFF WE WERE SHOCKED TO SEE THAT THE FRAME WAS COVERED TOP TO BOTTOM WITH RUST. I HAVE RESTORED OLDER TRUCKS IN THE PAST SOME FROM THE 40'S AND I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED RUST LIKE I HAVE SEEN ON THIS ONE, IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS NO PAINT ON IT FROM THE FACTORY AT ALL. WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF WIRE BRUSHING THE FRAME SO WE CAN SPRAY A RUST CONVERTER AND TRY TO REPAINT THE FRAME. I HAVE READ SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE RUST ON THESE TRUCKS AND FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT FORD SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE JUST LIKE TOYOTA WAS WHEN THEY HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION INVOLVING RUSTED FRAMES ON THEIR TRUCKS.

AFTER RETURNING TO COLLEGE LATER THAT WEEK HE STATED IT WORSENED TO LEAKAGE ON THE GROUND OF DUEL 4\" SPOTS, ONE ON EACH SIDE BELOW THE TANK. AFTER VIEWING A PHOTO OF THE BOTTOM OF THE WET TANK I NOTICED DROPS ON THE FORWARD STRAP. I DROVE THE TRUCK TO MY LOCATION THIS PAST WEEKEND AND PULLED THE BED OFF TO ACCESS THE TOP OF THE FUEL PUMP WHICH HAD STANDING FUEL. UPON TURNING THE KEY TO ACTIVATE THE FUEL PUMP I SAW A FINE PINHOLE SIZED STREAM PUMPING FROM THE PLASTIC 90 DEGREE FITTING ON TOP OF THE PUMP. UPON CLOSER INVESTIGATION I NOTICED THIS LEAKING FITTING HAD WHAT APPEARED TO BE ABRASION AT THE OUTSIDE TURN. I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT FITTING AND REPLACED IT FIXING THE LEAKAGE PROBLEM. THE COST OF THIS REPAIR TO ME WAS THE 8 HOURS VACATION TIME AT $28 PER HOUR I WAS REQUIRED TO USE TO ACCOMPLISH THE REPAIR AND THE COST OF THE NEW FUEL LINE FITTING.

HAD THIS FAILURE GONE UNDETECTED, IGNORED OR EVEN SPRAYED FUEL ONTO THE ADJACENT HOT EXHAUST THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC.

I DIDN'T KNOW HOW SEVERE IT WAS UNTIL I NOTICED THE LEFT REAR SIDE OF MY TRUCK SAGGING NOTICEABLY.  I LOOKED UNDERNEATH AND SAW THE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS HAD RUSTED AND CORRODED SO BADLY THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER PHYSICALLY CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE AND THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BED OF THE TRUCK IS NOW RESTING ON THE DISCONNECTED SUSPENSION COMPONENTS. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF THE FRAME HAS CORRODED AWAY, ABOUT A 6X6 SQUARE PORTION JUST IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. I ALSO NOTICED AT THIS TIME THAT ONE OF TWO STRAPS HOLDING UP THE FUEL TANK WAS HANGING COMPLETELY LOOSE.  THE MOUNT FOR THE STRAP WHICH IS WELDED TO THE FRAME WAS ALSO COMPLETELY CORRODED AWAY.  IF THE OTHER STRAP WERE TO FAIL IN THE SAME MANNER THE FUEL TANK WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ANY WAY OF STAYING ATTACHED TO THE VEHICLE.  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL HARM AND DAMAGE THIS COULD CAUSE TO MYSELF AND/OR OTHER MOTORISTS IF I WERE DRIVING ON THE STREET OR HIGHWAY WHEN THAT OCCURRED.  THE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE ALSO ARE SEVERELY CORRODED TO THE POINT THAT THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.      THE TRUCK IS ONLY 11 YEARS OLD WITH ONLY 93000 MILES AND I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN UNLESS IT WAS CAUSED BY INFERIOR MATERIALS, CRAFTSMANSHIP OR UNDERCARRIAGE PROTECTION FROM THE FACTORY.  DESPITE LIVING IN AN AREA OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WINTERS ARE TOUGH ON CARS I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE HAVING SUCH SEVERE RUST AND CORROSION EXCEPT FOR TWO PEOPLE I KNOW WERE TOYOTA TACOMA OWNERS WHO WERE SUBJECT TO THE RUST AND CORROSION RECALL FOR CERTAIN TACOMAS.  IN ADDITION I HAD THE REAR BRAKE LINES RUST OUT ON ME WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING LAST SPRING.  I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY GET THE VEHICLE BACK HOME AND REPAIRED WITH NO HARM CAUSED.  I DIDN'T NOTICE THE SEVERE RUST ELSEWHERE AT THE TIME AND SOON AFTER PASSED MA INSPECTION. *TR",

THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WERE, THAT, BEFORE IT WAS FIXED I WOULD STOP THE TRUCK \"PUT IT IN PARK\" GET OUT, AND THE TRUCK WOULD START ROLLING. FORTUNATELY, I BEGAN USING THE PARKING BRAKE BEFORE I FIGURED OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.     I ONLY USE MY TRUCK ON ROUGH ROADS ABOUT 5% OF THE TIME.  SINCE THIS PART IS IN A REALLY OUT OF SIGHT PLACE THE SCREWS SHOULD HAVE SOME EXTRA LOCKING MECHANISM OR ADHESIVE ON THEM BECAUSE THE CONSUMER OR MECHANIC IS NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR THE PROBLEM WHICH IS OUT OF SIGHT AND IN A HARD TO REACH PLACE.  *NM",

MY BUMPER WAS CREASED IN THE CENTER, PUSHING IT BACK INTO MY RADIATOR, FRONT GRILL WAS CRUSHED, HOOD WAS SMASHED UPWARD, WINDSHEILD WAS BROKEN, BOTH FRONT PARTS OF THE FRAME WERE BENT INWARD TOWARDS THE CENTER,  STEERING WHEEL WAS BENT AT THE TOP FORWARD AND THE CENTER OF THE STEERING WHEEL WAS CRACKED TO THE POINT THAT I WAS UNABLE TO STEER THE TRUCK AS THE STEERING WHEEL JUST SPUN AROUND WITHOUT TURNING THE FRONT WHEELS. I WAS WEARING MY SEAT BELT AS WAS MY 5YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I WAS THROWN AGIANST THE STEERING WHEEL AND MY KNEES HIT THE DASH BOARD UNDER THE STEERING WHEEL. I FEEL THAT MY DRIVER AIRBAG SHOULD HAVE GONE OFF PREVENTING ME FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE DASH BOARD. THE TRUCK HAS NOT BEEN FIXED AS OF YET, AS I AM WAITING ON THE OTHER DRIVERS INSURANCE COMPANY TO HAVE IT APPRAISED FOR DAMAGES. I HAVE BEEN SEEING A CHIROPRACTOR FOR MY BACK, SHOULDERS, ARMS, NECK. CONSTANT NUMBNESS IN MY ARMS AND HANDS, AS WELL AS PAIN IN MY BACK AROUND MY SHOULDERS. MY KNEES ARE CONSTANTLY SORE AND OCCAISIONALLY SWOLLEN. I AM UNABLE TO BEND DOWN AT MY KNEES BECAUSE OF THE PAIN WHEN STANDING BACK UP, AND FEAR OF DISLOCATING MY KNEES WHICH HAS HAPPEN ALREADY. I AM UNABLE TO COME UP WITH FUNDS TO SEE A KNEE SPECIALIST. I WAS LAID OFF FROM MY WORK SINCE I COULDNT CLIMB A LADDER AND INSTALL SIGNS, OR WORK IN THE SHOP DOING SIGN  MANUFACTURING, UNABLE TO STAND FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. UNABLE TO ACTIVILY SEARCH FOR WORK IN FLAGSTAFF, BECAUSE I HAD TO MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN MUNDS PARK, AZ. WHICH IS 28 MILES AWAY FROM CITY LIMITS. NOTHING BUT FORESTRY BETWEEN TOWNS.

PUT 2 NEW TIARES ON BACK AND EXTENSIVE WORK DONE ON BACKEND.  ASSUMED TIRES WERE BALANCED AND FRONT AND BACK ALIGNED.  I HAD IT BACK AGAIN JULY 22,2001.

THE FRONT END SHAKES RELLY BAD AT 60MPH, AND WHEN I TRY TO SPEED UP THE MOTOR BOGS DOWN .   I TOOK IT BACK FOR ALL THIS AND ONCE AGAIN NOTHING IS WRONG EXCEPT MY INAGINATION, AND THE WHEELS NEED TO BE BALANCED AND THE FARONT END NEEDS RE-ALIGNMENT.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE REASON IT WOULDN'T SPEED UP WHEN GIVEN GAS WAS BECAUSE OF THE CARPET UNDER THE GAS PEDDAL, SO THEY REMOVED IT.  THE CLUTCH IS STILL NOT ENGAGING CORRECTLY AND THEY STILL SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  MY WARRANTUY IS OUT AT 36000 MILES AND I WANT THIS TRUCK FIXED NOW NOT NEXT YEAR.  BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN THEY THINK THAT I AM STUPID BUT I HAVE NEWS FOR THEM.  THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TRUCK AND IF I'D HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING I WOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED THE TRUCK AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

BEFORE THE TIRE SEPERATED, MY FIANCE AND I HEARD A VERY LOUD GRINDING NOISE- DURING WHICH TIME I IMMEDIATELY LET OFF THE GAS. ABOUT 30 SECONDS AFTER WE FIRST HEARD THE NOISE, THE TRUCK VIOLENTLY FISHTAILED IN THE REAR END, AND I PROCEEDED TO GENTLY APPLY THE BRAKES UNTIL WE CAME TO A STOP. THAT NIGHT WHILE I WAS WORKING MY NIGHTSHIFT- I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY WHO TOLD ME TO SPEAK TO MY DEALERSHIP. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, MY DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THIS NEW TIRE HAD SEPERATED DUE TO A SMALL PUNCTURE IN THE TREAD. FIRESTONE REFUSES TO REPLACE THIS NEW TIRE, AS THIS TRUCK WAS SOLD TO ME WITHOUT ROAD HAZARD COVERAGE ON THIS TIRE. I AM VERY UPSET BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE- I HAVE HAD OTHER FLATS ON OTHER VEHICLE THAT I OWNED WITHOUT THE TIRES SEPERATING WHILE DRIVING. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER- I FAIL TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE NORMAL REACTION OF A TIRE WITH A MINOR 2MM PUNCTION IN THE TREAD. MY TIRE MECHANIC WHERE I TOOK THIS TIRE TO OBTAIN A 3RD OPINION AGREES WITH MY ASSESSMENT IN THIS MATTER. I VALUE HIS JUDGMENT ABOVE ALL, HE HAS NOTHING TO GAIN BY GIVING ME A FALSE STATEMENT, WHEREAS MY DEALERSHIP, AND FIRESTONE OBVIOUSLY HAVE PLENTY TO LOSE IN ADMITTING THAT THIS TIRE MAY BE A MANUFACTURE'S DEFECT.
