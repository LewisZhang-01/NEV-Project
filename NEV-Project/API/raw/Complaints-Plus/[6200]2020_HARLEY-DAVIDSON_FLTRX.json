(They couldn\u2019t tell me why it failed on a brand new motorcycle) Fast forward to July 11, 2021 the front brakes have play in them causing the motorcycle to crash and cause major damage to the entire motorcycle when going into a turn. This motorcycle as described by the dealership has a factory installed RDRS system which is supposed to take control over the motorcycle when slippage in the tire happens. The motorcycle is currently in for repair at a local shop. This bike is available to be inspected.",
