It almost stalled my vehicle while transmission was in drive while stopped. It feels like dragging when the power loss occurs. This has occurred randomly for the past month, mostly during interstate driving with cruise control operating. It has happened the last six times I have driven, but the previous several times it did not occur. It also occurred in a similar random fashion for the prior two weeks. When it does occur it feels like power drain and deceleration that can last a second and this will occur several times during a twenty minute drive at 70mph. Mechanics at two shops seem confused and don't know where to begin except for a transmission fluid flush. That was completed and the problem has persisted. There are no related error codes.  To lose power suddenly and unexpectedly could cause an accident especially if a system failure shuts off the vehicle while driving.  This vehicle has had an oil consumption/burning problem since I bought it with around 60,000miles. It needed 2 quarts of oil added between the last oil changes. I have spent $1400 in July of this year on gasket replacements and that did not stop the leak. More gasket heads and an oil pan are going to be need to replaced and the estimate is another $1400. This is too much to be spending on possibly related issues in a short time span that may not resolve the problem.",

THEY RAN TESTS ALL DAY TO SAY THAT A CONNECTION IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT  AND A TERMINAL NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ($264).  BEFORE GETTING HOME, WHICH IS ABOUT 10 MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON.  CALL THE DEALERSHIP AND RETURNED CAR.  THIS TIME THEY TELL ME THAT THE SEAT BELT PRETENSIONER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ($215).  I FELT I WAS BEING GIVEN THE RUN AROUND SO I DID NOT GET IT REPAIRED THERE.  SIX MONTHS LATER THE LIGHT COMES BACK ON.  I TAKE IT TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP THINKING THEY HAVE BETTER QUALITY CARS AND THEY TEST IT.  THEY SAY THAT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE IN THE SEAT AND THAT IT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $700 TO REPAIR.  I CONTACT GM TO SEE IF THERE IS A RECALL OR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE.  THEY STATE NO RECALL AND THAT IF IT'S NOT REPAIRED BY CERTIFIED GM DEALERSHIP, IF IT IS LATER RECALLED I WILL NOT BE REFUNDED.  I TAKE IT TO CERTIFIED GM DEALER AND THEY SAY THEY DON'T FIND ANYTHING BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN RESET.  LAST WEEK, AFTER THE LIGHT STAYING ON CONTINUOUSLY I TAKE IT TO THE CERTIFIED GM DEALERSHIP.  THEY RUN DIAGNOSTICS AND TELL ME THAT IT'S THE SEAT BELT PRETENSIONER.  AFTER PAYING APPROXIMATELY $325 AND THEM KEEPING MY CAR FOR A WEEK, I RECEIVE THE CAR BACK AND 35 MILES LATER THE LIGHT REAPPEARS.  I AM DEFINITELY SICK OF THIS CAR AND THINK GM IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO FIX IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER RECALLS THEY ARE HAVING.  I HAVE SPENT OVER $700 TO NO AVAIL.  MY NEXT CAR WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE ANYTHING GM!  CALLING GM IS A WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE THEY ACT AS IF MY CALL IS A BURDEN TO THEM.  *TR",

I HATE TO THINK WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THIS HAD HAPPENED EARLIER AS WE WERE TRAVELING THRU ATLANTA WITH ITS 6 LANES OF HEAVY TRAFFIC.  SUDDENLY LOSING POWER AND CONTROL IN THAT TRAFFIC WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CAUSED ONE OF THOSE MULTI-VEHICLE ACCIDENTS THAT MAKE THE NATIONAL NEWS.    WHAT KIND OF INCOMPETENT PROGRAMMING OF THE CAR'S COMPUTER WOULD TRIGGER A FULL, INSTANT SHUTDOWN BECAUSE OF A FAULTY ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR?  I WOULD SUGGEST AN IMMEDIATE RECALL TO RE-FLASH THE COMPUTER TO ELIMINATE THE NO-WARNING SHUT DOWN.  *TR",

THE NEXT DAY MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT PLUS THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM LIGHT CAME ON....  NOW, I ONLY HAD THIS CAR NOT EVEN 2MONTHS AND MAKING PAYMENTS AND I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT (ALREADY).  ANY OTHER CAR THAT I HAD HAVE IN THE PAST I MADE SUDDEN STOPS AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS NEVER COMES ON. WHATS GOING ON WITH THE CHEVROLET IMPALAS?  THEY LOOK NICE BUT THEY ARE SSSOOOO NOT WORTH THE COST TO PURCHASE OR TO GET REPAIRED. THIS IS THE ONLY BAD INVESTMENT I HAVE EVER MADE IN MY LIFE. I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH MY MAZDA. I WILL LET IT BE KNOWN TO ANYONE WHO ASK ME ABOUT CHEVROLET TO DONT EVEN BOTHERED.  THERE ARE BETTER CARS THAN THE CHEVROLET.  THIS CAR IS ALSO A GAS GUZZLER. I PUT $50 IN THE TANK EVERY 5 DAYS WHEN DRIVING LOCALLY. I ONLY WORK 10 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE. EVERYTIME YOU STOP YOU LOOSE GAS MILEAGE ON YOUR DIC THE GAS IS GREAT ON THE HIGHWAY THOUGH.

WHEN I GOOGLE THE PROBLEM TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG IT SEEMS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE IMPALA.  THE PROBLEM CAUSES THE CAR TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEFORE IT SHUTS OFF, IT JUST DIES RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. FIRST THE TRACTION LIGHT WILL COME ON A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THEN YOUR CAR WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE SHUTTING DOWN, THEN IT WILL JUST TURN OFF. THIS IS VERY SCARY. IF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THIS PROBLEM, ISN'T IT A MATTER THAT CHEVY SHOULD HAVE TO RECALL? I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO MOST CARS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD.  THEY SEEM TO HAVE A FEATURE THAT SHUTS DOWN THE POWER IF THE CAR THINGS IT IS LOSING CONTROL OF THE TIRES, BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THE TIRES ARE FINE BUT THE SENSOR IS MESSED UP. I HAVE READ MANY POSTS COMPLAINING OF THIS SAME ISSUE. IT CAN'T BE SAFE TO HAVE CARS JUST SHUT DOWN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I WAS ALMOST HIT! MY DAUGHTER WAS IN THE CAR. I WAS BARLEY IN THE SHOULDER AS IT SHUT DOWN RIGHT AS I WAS PULLING ONTO IT.  *TR",

THEREFORE I HAD TO BE TROUBLED WITH FINDING JUMPER CABLES WHILE AWAY FROM HOME OR BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST CHEVROLET DEALER (WHOM I MIGHT ADD DID NOT HAVE A TECHNICIAN THAT COULD FIX IT ON A SATURDAY MORNING).
