I HAVE A 2018 TIFFIN COACH AND HAD THE SAME ISSUE SOON AFTER I PURCHASED IT.  I NOTICED THAT THE VALVE STEM WAS RUBBING ON THE CHROME WHEEL AND IN FACT HAD RUBBED OFF THE CHROME DOWN TO BARE METAL.  I TOOK IT TO BAY DIESEL IN RED BAY, AL. AND THEY REPLACE THE VALVE STEMS.  THEY SHOWED ME ON ONE WHERE IT HAD ALMOST RUBBED THROUGH AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AIR LEAK IF I HAD DRIVEN IT MANY MORE MILES.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT WARRANTABLE AND I PAID FOR THE REPLACEMENT STEMS.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN SOON AFTER AND WHEN I CALLED FREIGHTLINER, THE PERSON I TALKED TO SAID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT HAVE NOT COME UP WITH A CORRECTION AS YET.  MFR BUILD DATE WAS 4/1/2018.",
