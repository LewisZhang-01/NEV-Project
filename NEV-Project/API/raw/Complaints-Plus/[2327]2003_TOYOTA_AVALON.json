IT DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME BUT IS NOTICEABLE MANY TIMES.   I GOT MY CAR CHECKED BY THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT I GET THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY CLEANED. I GOT THIS WORK DONE. IT SEEMED TO HAVE IMPROVED FOR A WHILE BUT THE PROBLEM CAME BACK AGAIN. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO SAME DEALERSHIP ON JAN 3, 2013 AND AGAIN ON APRIL 13, 2013 BUT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM SINCE IT HAPPENS ERRATICALLY AND NOT ALL THE TIME. I INSISTED THAT THE PROBLEM DOES HAPPEN AND THEY KEPT MY CAR FOR ALMOST A DAY BUT COULD NOT REPLICATE IT.  THIS HAS BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE FOR ME ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING IN A STOP AND GO TYPE OF TRAFFIC.  I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER DATED APRIL 4, 2013 TO THE TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY TELL ME THAT THE VEHICLE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.   THIS PROBLEM IS SIMILAR TO THE ERRATIC ACCELERATION PROBLEMS REPORTED FOR OTHER TOYOTA CARS IN THE PRESS.

WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT DOWN THE HIGHWAY, I LET OFF THE GAS TO SLOW DOWN AND IT STARTED TO SPEED UP.  I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE STARTED TO REV UP AND DOWN FROM 1000 RPM TO 2500 RPM.  THIS CONTINUED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNTIL I WAS FORCED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART IT.  (THIS IS ALWAYS THE FIX...TURN OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT.
