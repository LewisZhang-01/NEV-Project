THE BRAKE HAD NO EFFECT SO BEFORE I HIT THE CURB I RELEASED THE BRAKE AND STRAIGHTENED THE BIKE SO I WOULD HIT THE CURB AT A RIGHT ANGLE AND WAS ABLE TO AVOID A TREE.  THE BIKE FLEW ABOUT 4-5 FT AND LANDED ON GRASS.  I TRIED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE BIKE BUT DESPITE MY EFFORTS THE ENGINE REMAINED WIDE OPEN.  I PULLED IN THE CLUTCH BUT THE BIKE SWERVED IN THE SLIPPERY GRASS AND WENT DOWN ON IT'S LEFT SIDE.  THE BIKE RIGHTED ITSELF AND KEPT GOING BUT FELL IMMEDIATELY AGAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  THIS SCENARIO REPEATED ITSELF ONE MORE TIME FALLING ON THE LEFT SIDE ONLY THIS TIME IT FELL MORE VIOLENTLY AND EJECTED ME INTO THE DIRT.

THE HARLEY DAVIDSON REP STATES THAT THE BIKE IS JUST FINE AND THAT WE NEED TO TAKE OFF THE LOWERS.

ONCE AGAIN IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I REMOVE THE LOWER FAIRING  AND  INSTALL A RACE TUNER AND  DIFFERENT MUFFLERS.  THIS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED EARLIER BY THE DEALER, AND  I WAS QUOTED A PRICE OF $1,500.00.  HARDLY A REASONABLE SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM I DID NOT CREATE.  SITTING ATOP A 400 DEGREE ENGINE IN SUMMER HEAT WAS A DAUNTING TASK.  LAST YEAR WHEN TEMPERATURE REACHED THE 90'S THE BIKE SAT IN MY GARAGE.  THE FAILURE OF HARLEY DAVIDSON  TO IN ANY WAY ACKNOWLEDGE THERE WAS A PROBLEM, IN SPITE OF MOTORCYCLE MAGAZINES & WEBSITES WITH LOTS OF COMPLAINTS,WAS  VERY DISAPPOINTING.*AK",

AFTER RIDING IT FOR A WHILE THE FIRST DAY OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS VISITING FROM CALIFORNIA THE REAR ENGINE, CYLINDER GOT UNBEARABLY HOT. THERE WHERE POINTS THAT WE WANTED TO JUMP OFF THE MOTORCYCLE. WE TOOK PICTURES OF THE BURNS IT CAUSED AND SENT THEM TO HARLEY DAVIDSON. I STILL HAVE THEM. THE DEALER AND HARLEY DAVIDSON STATED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OFF THE LOWERS AND THAT SHOULD CURE THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, NOW IT IS GETTING HOTTER AND COMING HOME FROM A ROAD TRIP IN 80 DEGREE WEATHER, WE COULDN'T STAND STILL AT A STOP LIGHT WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE BIKE. WE THEN CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD US THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE HEATING ISSUE IS TO PURCHASE A RACE TUNER FOR AN ADDITIONAL $1000.00. THE BURNING IS INTENSE. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE, NOT ONE THAT THE CONSUMERS PROBLEM. THEY (HARLEY DAVIDSON) ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND HAVE DONE NOTHING TO FIX IT, EXCEPT TO OFFER SOMETHING ELSE TO PURCHASE. IS THIS INTENTIONAL? WITH MALICE? DO NOT CARE? WHY IS SOMEBODY NOT MAKING THEM FIX THIS? ALSO, THE PIPES WERE BURNED SO BAD THAT WE SENT PICTURES TO HARLEY DAVIDSON OF THE INTENSE COLORATION, THEY SAID NORMAL COLORING. THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST MOTORCYLE. WE TRADED IN AN 03 SCREAMING EAGLE ROAD KING, THAT HAD A BIGGER MOTOR, BUT NEVER HAD A HEATING ISSUE. WE WOULDN'T HAD BOUGHT THIS MOTORCYCLE IF WE KNEW THEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW.  *JB",

ON SEPT. 29, 2006 I PICKED UP BIKE, AND AM STILL HAVING ALL LOUD NOISES, AND THEY TOLD ME JUST TO RIDE IT AT HIGHER RPM'S.  THIS BIKE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR MY 22K GIVEN BACK.
