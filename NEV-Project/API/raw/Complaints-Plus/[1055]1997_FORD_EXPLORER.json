THEN, I GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND THE SMOKE KEPT GETTING HEAVIER. I BEGAN FEELING AROUND FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS HOT. I CHECKED THE DASH, THE VENTS, THE STEERING WHEEL, THE SEATS - ALMOST EVERYTHING BEFORE I CHECKED THE CENTER COMPUTER CONSOLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF MY CAR - DIRECTLY UNDER THE RADIO - THERE IS A COMPUTER MODULE THAT DISPLAYS THE GAS MILEAGE, OIL STATUS, AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE LIGHTS ON THE CAR. THE MODULE HAD RECENTLY STARTED DISPLAYING A \"CHECK HEADLAMPS\" MESSAGE. WELL - I HAD DONE SO AND THEY WERE WORKING FINE - SO I DID NOT THINK ANYTHING OF IT. TURNS OUT THAT THE FIRE HAD STARTED UNDER THE CENTER COMPUTER MODULE. I GUESS THAT THE CAR SHOULD HAVE BLOWN A FUSE BUT INSTEAD - STARTED A FIRE. I TRIED TO RIP THE COVER AND THE CONSOLE UP - BUT IT WAS SCREWED DOWN AND I HAD NO LUCK. AT THAT POINT, THE FLAMES STARTED TO SPREAD VERY QUICKLY AND THE ENTIRE CAR WENT UP IN FLAMES IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. I CALLED 911 AND GOT AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD WITH MY BELONGINGS. THE FIRE TRUCK AND FIRE FIGHTERS CAME WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OR SO AND PUT OUT THE FIRE BEFORE IT REACHED THE GAS TANK. THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE CAR REMAINED UNTOUCHED, HOWEVER, THE INTERIOR WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. THE SEATS HAD BURNT OFF AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY GONE.

WE HAD NOT YET DRIVEN IT OFF PAVEMENT WITH THE NEW TIRES.    ON 4/16/2014 I STARTED THE CAR TO GO TO WORK.  I HEARD AN ODD NOISE FROM THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE, ALMOST LIKE A RHYTHMIC POPPING SOUND, BUT IT STOPPED, AND SINCE IT WASN'T IDENTIFIABLE I PROCEEDED TO LEAVE MY DRIVEWAY.  ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY, I HEARD THE NOISE AGAIN, BUT AGAIN IT STOPPED.  AT THIS POINT THE CAR WAS HANDLING FINE.    AS SOON AS I GOT ON THE FREEWAY (APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES FROM MY HOUSE), I NOTICED I WAS HAVING TROUBLE ACCELERATING TO SPEED (65MPH).  I ALSO BEGAN TO HEAR A RHYTHMIC BUMPING NOISE, SO BEGAN TO PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER.  BY THE TIME I GOT OVER, I COULD FEEL THE BUMPING AND KNEW I HAD A FLAT.    THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL HAD SUFFERED A COMPLETE SIDEWALL SEPARATION (SEE PHOTO).  THE TIRES ONLY HAD 6,624 MILES ON THEM ? ALL PAVED ROAD, NO DIRT.  THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY WARRANTIED TO 85,000 MILES.  IN RETROSPECT, I BELIEVE THE SOUNDS I HEARD IN MY DRIVEWAY WERE THE INITIAL SIDEWALL SEPARATION.  THE SEPARATION DID NOT CAUSE IMMEDIATE LOSS OF AIR PRESSURE OR STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY;  THAT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE I GOT ON THE HIGHWAY AND STARTED DRIVING AT 60MPH.  THERE WAS NO EXPLOSIVE NOISE LIKE A BLOWOUT.    IN SUBSEQUENTLY RESEARCHING KUMHO TIRES, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS BRAND HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH SUDDEN SIDEWALL SEPARATION AND/OR BLOWOUTS ? ALL AT LOW MILEAGES.  THIS OCCURS ACROSS SEVERAL TIRE MODELS AND YEARS.  THE COMPLAINTS WERE SO CONSISTENT THAT I WENT BACK TO THE TIRE DEALER AND REQUESTED A DIFFERENT BRAND.  THEY REPLACED THEM AND I NOTIFIED THEM OF MY RESEARCH RESULTS.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT KUMHO IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE SELLING TIRES WITH SUCH A SAFETY RISK.

I REQUESTED THE RIGHT TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER AAMCO CENTER, BUT YOUR RESPONSE WAS TO TAKE IT TO THE CENTER THAT I ALREADY HAD DOUBTS ABOUT. LET ME SET THE SCENARIO AGAIN.  ?WITH INITIAL GRINDING SOUNDS AND LACK OF REVERSE, I TOOK TO CLINTON TRANSMISSIONS IN 2011 AND THEY INFORMED ME THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REBUILT. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED UNTIL 2012.  ?IN 2012, I CALLED THE WALDORF AAMCO CENTER AND THEY INFORMED ME IT MAY NOT BE THE TRANSMISSION AND TO LET THEM LOOK AT IT. IT WAS TOWED IN AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS FINE BUT THE TRANSFER CASE WAS BAD.   ?ALL TOTALED, I PAID $1534.76 FOR TRANSFER CASE, $430.03 FOR PARTS, AND $600 FOR LABOR. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE OTHER SERVICES THAT THE CENTER SAID I NEEDED.  ?THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TWICE FOR AN OD LIGHT THAT CAME ON AS SOON AS I LEFT THE CENTER. THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.   ?I FELT CONCERN FOR THE PERIOD I WAS DRIVING AND WROTE CORPORATE TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE.   ?EARLIER THIS YEAR WHILE DRIVING TO SOUTH CAROLINA, THE GRINDING SOUND STARTED AGAIN AND REVERSE WENT OUT. I NOTIFIED CORPORATE AND THE WALDORF CENTER AND WAS TOLD TO GO TO THE NEAREST AAMCO.  ?I WENT TO THE COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA AAMCO  AND AFTER DIAGNOSTIC, TOLD ME THE SAME THING THAT THE CLINTON TRANSMISSION TOLD ME IN 2011. THE TRANSMISSION HAD INTERNAL DAMAGE AND NEEDED TO BE REBUILT.  ?I LEFT THE VEHICLE IN COLUMBIA AND HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE.

I HAD THE NEGATIVE CABLE GROUNDED TO A BRACKET RIGHT NEXT TO THE BATTERY (THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE TO GROUND TO). WHILE TRYING TO JUMP THE OTHER VEHICLE FUEL STARTED LEAKING FROM THE FUEL LINES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THAT BRACKET. THE FUEL LINES WERE MELTED BECAUSE OF JUMPING ON THAT BRACKET AND THERE WAS FUEL RUNNING OVER THE JUMPER CABLES AND DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE. I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED BUT MOST LIKELY KILLED IF THE JUMPER CABLES SPARKED. I WAS LOOKING ON THE INTERNET TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO HAVE THE FUEL LINES REPLACED AND I STUMBLED ACROSS A RECALL STATING THAT ON MY SPECIFIC EXPLORER  \" THE ENGINE FUEL LINES CAN BE DAMAGED IF THE VEHICLE IS JUMP STARTED AND THE GROUND CABLE IS ATTACHED TO THE FUEL LINE BRACKET THAT IS LOCATED NEAR THE BATTERY. SINCE THE BRACKET IS NOT GROUNDED, THE STAINLESS STEEL FUEL LINE BRAID COULD ACT AS A GROUND POTENTIALLY OVERHEATING THE PTFE INNER LINER OF THE FUEL LINE RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO THE FUEL LINE.   CONSEQUENCE:  THE FUEL LINES CAN LEAK, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITION SOURCE, A FIRE COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT.   REMEDY:  DEALERS WILL INSTALL A WARNING LABEL ON THE FUEL LINE BRACKET ADVISING OWNERS NOT TO USE IT FOR A JUMP START GROUND.\"    I WENT AND CHECKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY KIND OF WARNING AND THERE WAS, BUT IT WAS NOT ON THE FUEL LINE BRACKET LIKE THE RECALL SAID THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD DO, IT WAS ON THE FUEL LINES AND TUCKED UP BEHIND THAT BRACKET WHERE IT WAS IN NO WAY VISIBLE UNLESS YOU KNEW IT WAS THERE. SO NOW IM GOING TO HAVE TO PAY $608.05 FOR FUEL LINES BECAUSE FAULKNER-CIACCO FORD DEALERSHIP DID NOT SERVICE MY EXPLORER CORRECTLY. I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY ASKING IF THEY WOULD PAY FOR IT AND THEY SAID THAT THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE FORD, OR THE DEALER SHOULD HAVE TO PAY SINCE THE WARNING LABEL WAS NOT CORRECTLY PLACED ON MY VEHICLE.   THE FORD RECALL # IS 98S09.  *TR",

I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO MY LOCAL SHOP FOR REPAIRS.

I CALLED ED MATEO AT HIGHLAND PARK FORD IN IL AND GAVE HIM MY VIN, [XXX].  HE AGREED THAT THE CAR WAS SUBJECT TO THE RECALL AND THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL LINE(S) AND INSTALL THE WARNING AND NEW GROUNDING BOLT.  I PICKED UP ME CAR FROM MY LOCAL REPAIRMAN THIS MORNING AND DROPPED IT OFF WITH ED AT HIGHLAND PARK FORD.  HE SAID THAT THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE FORD RECALL NO. 98S09.  HE CALLED ME A HALF HOUR LATER AND SAID THAT HIS MANAGER WOULD NOT LET HIM REPAIR THE CAR UNDER THE RECALL SINCE IT DIDN'T COME UP IN THEIR SYSTEM UNDER MY VIN - EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ALREADY CLEARED THIS EARLIER.  I CALLED JESSIE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE, 800-392-FORD, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE REASON IT DIDN'T COME UP UNDER MY VIN WAS BECAUSE THE RECALL WORK (WARNING AND NEW BOLT) WAS ALREADY PERFORMED ON MY CAR, BUT SHE COULDN'T TELL ME WHO DID IT.

I OBTAINED THEIR OWN PROCEEDURES FOR THIS ISSUE BECAUSE MANY ENGINES HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACE DUE TO THE PIECES OF THE BROKEN TENSIONER CLOGGING OIL PASSAGES AND DESTROYING THE ENGINES. THE INSTRUCTIONS THEY SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED INCLUDED INSPECTING THE HEADS FOR CLOGGED PASSAGES AND OTHER THINGS. I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE ENGINE THEN, BUT THEY MADE ME TAKE IT. AS SOON AS I LEFT DEALER, THE NOISE WAS BACK. CALLED THEM AND THEY SAID TO GIVE IT A WEEK AND SEE IF IT GOES AWAY. IT GOT WORSE AND I BROUGHT IT BACK IN TO THE DEALER. THIS TIME THEY SAID IT WAS THE REAR TENSIONER (THE ONE NOT COVERERED BY THEIR RECALL SINCE IT REQUIRES REMOVING THE ENGINE. SAME PART- SAME DEFECT, BUT NOT COVERED DUE TO COST). SINCE FORD WAS LOSING TOO MUCH MONEY ON THEIR DEFECT REPLACING ENGINES, THEY STOPPED HELPING THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE DEALER OFFERED A $500 AND 75,000 MILE WARRANTEE DEALER CONCESSION, BUT I EXPECTED IT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. THE DEFECTIVE PART RUINED THE ENGINE AND IT SHOULD BE REPLACED, OR AT LEAST REPAIRED PROPERLY.   HAVE BEEN AT  A STAND-STILL FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW WITH A NON-FUNCIONING VEHICLE. FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING AND THE DEALER NOW WANTS $5000 FOR A NEW ENGINE.*AK",

THE CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM FAILED IN 1998 AND I TOOK IT TO LES PINKAM LINCOLN MERCURY IN ELIZABETHTOWN, KY FOR REPAIR.  WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT, THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THE BLEND AIR DOOR HAD BROKEN AND IT WOULD COSTS $800 TO REPAIR IT.  THINKING HE WAS LYING, I TOOK IT TO BILL COLLINS FORD IN LOUISVILLE, KY.  AGAIN, THE SAME RESULTS AND REPAIR ESTIMATE.  TECHNICIANS AT BOTH PLACES, TOLD ME IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM.  I EVENTUALLY HAD LES PINKAM REPAIR IT. IT SEEMS THAT FORD WOULD DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT WOULDN'T REQUIRE THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE DASH TO REPAIR IT, MUCH CONTINUE WITH A DESIGN WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS.  YEARS LATER AND THE PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED AGAIN.  IN ADDITION I CAME ACROSS TSB ARTICLE NUMBER 98-23-20 IN MY SEARCHES, BUT COULDN'T FIND THE ARTICLE AT YOUR WEB-SITE.  I ALSO HAVE HAD THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT TWICE AND FINALLY REPLACED IT WITH ONE FROM A SALVAGE YARD.  I COULDN'T SEE REPAIRING IT A THIRD TIME WHEN A FORD TECHNICIAN AND PRIVATE YARD COULDN'T FIX IT.  BOTH TIMES WITHIN 13 MONTHS AFTER REPAIR, THE CAR WOULD SUDDENLY COMPLETELY FAIL AND TACH OUT AS IF IT WERE IN NEUTRAL.  I COULD GET IT TO DO IT WITH A FORD TECHNICIAN AND HIS CODE SENSOR PLUGGED IN.  THIS HAS COME CLOSE TO HAVING ME GET REAR ENDED ON THE INTERSTATE 65, ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS IN CRUISE CONTROL.  FOR NO REASON AT ALL THE  TRANSMISSION WOULD COMPLETELY DISENGAGE AND THE ENGINE WOULD ALMOST COMPLETELY TACK OUT BEFORE I COULD HIT THE BRAKE PEDALS TO DIS-ENGAGE.  TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, I'VE SPENT ALMOST $6000 IN REPAIRS SINCE OWNING THIS VEHICLE.  IN ADDITION, I'VE HAD IT IN FOR MANY RECALLS.

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO KEEP PAYING FOR REPAIRS OF THIS CAR, WHEN FORD KNOWS THEY HAVE MANUFACTURED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD TO TAKE THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR EXPENSIVE REPAIRS FOR DEFECTS THAT FORD KNOWS ABOUT AND REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR.MERICAN AUTO MANUFACTURERS WANT TO KNOW WHY THE AMERICAN CITIZEN HAS STOPPED BUYING AMERICAN CARS? WELL THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. WE  WANT TO GET WHAT WE ARE PAYING FOR ($28,000.00 WORTH)!! AND FORD AUTO MANUFACTURER, IS NOT GIVING US WHAT WE ARE PAYING FOR... INSTEAD THEY ARE TAKING US TO THE CLEANERS FINANCIALLY..   *AK",

THE ZONE MANAGER WOULD NOT MEET TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM.  CUSTOMER PAID $4,800 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.  CUSTOMER KEPT THE BROKEN SHAFT WHICH SHOWS MULTIPLE INTERNAL SURFACE TEXTURES.  TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM WITHOUT A RESPONSE ON THIS SAFETY AND MANUFACTURING ISSUE FROM FORD.  OTHER WEBSITES REPORT FORD EMPLOYEES AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS A \"STACKING OF TOLERENCES\" WHEREBY THE TOLERENCES EXERT PRESSURE ON THE CRANKSHAFT JUST BEHIND THE KEY WHERE IT ATTACHES TO THE DAMPNER.  THIS IS REPORTEDLY NOT A CONDITION THAT THE OWNER CAN PREVENT, DIAGNOSE OR OTHERWISE BE AWARE OF UNTIL THE CRANKSHAFT BREAKS.  FORD REPORTEDLY CANNOT MAKE A PRIOR DETERMINATION EITHER, SEEMINGLY LEAVING IT TO CHANCE WHETHER A VEHICLE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS.  CERTAIN ENGINE COMPNENTS ARE EXPECTED TO FAIL DURING ENGINE LIFE SUCH AS WATER PUMPS, ALTERNATORS AND SO FORTH BUT MAJOR COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT.  FORD SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY REVEALING THE DESIGN LIFE OF THE CRANKSHAFT.  J.D. POWERS RELAYED TO THIS CUSTOMER THAT CRANKSHAFTS ARE ROUTINELY DESIGNED TO LAST 200 - 250K MILES, CONTRARY TO DEALER ASSERTATIONS.  THE NHTSA NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION.",

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH . I  HOPE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THESE PARTS REPLACED  BY THE COMPANIES SO THAT NO ONE WITH A MODIFIED HANDICAPPED STEERING COLUMN EXTENSION DOES NOT GET KILLED OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE , I WAS LUCKY TO FIND IT EARLY  BUT MAYBE SOME ONE ELSE WON'T BE.

THERE MAYBE MANY FORD EXPLORERS ON THE ROAD WITH THIS DEFECTIVE PART, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COST TO REPAIR IS PROHIBITIVE.

MY EXPLORER HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN SEVERE SKIP/MISS FOR THE PAST 2-MONTHS.  AT FIRST INDICATION....I SCHEDULED IT IN TO MY LOCAL DEALER (ROCHESTER AUTO COLLECTION -  A DIVISION OF FORD), WHO DETERMINED THAT IT NEEDED NEW IGNITION WIRES.  (MIND YOU, THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 42,000 ORIGINAL MILES, AS I BOUGHT IT NEW).  THREE HUNDRED BUCKS LATER, I NOTICE THE VEHICLE PERFORMING NO BETTER ON THE DAY I PICKED IT UP.  SO....WE SCHEDULE A SECOND VISIT.  DURING THAT VISIT, THEY \"DINK AROUND\" WITH THE THROTTLE.  AGAIN, THE DAY I PICKED IT UP, I NOTICED IT  WAS NO BETTER.  SO....IN WE GO FOR A THIRD VISIT.  DURING THAT VISIT I AM ADVISED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER HAS BROKEN OFF AND THAT THEY WILL NEED TO PULL THE ENGINE OUT TO REPAIR.  SO, WE SCHEDULE THAT 3-DAY SERVICE VISIT.  AND HERE I AM TODAY.....AFTER HAVING PICKED UP THE VEHICLE, AND NOW IT IS WORSE!!  THIS IS A $30,000 VEHICLE WITH 43,000 MILES THAT RUNS WORSE THAN MY SON'S '95 CAVALIER.  AS I REVIEW THE DATABASE OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, I NOTE MANY, MANY ISSUES RELATING TO THIS TIMING BELT TENSIONER.  SO......WHEN IS THE NHTSA GONNA STEP UP TO THE PLATE, AND MAKE FORD GET THEIR \"DUCKS IN A ROW\" AND FIX THIS ISSUE.   AS IT IS RIGHT NOW, BETWEEN THE TIRE INCIDENT AND THEN THIS, I SINCERELY DOUBT I WILL EVER BUY A FORD AGAIN. *TR",

IN SEPTEMBER 2000 I NOTICED CRACKING AROUND THE EXTERIOR WALLS AND TIRE TREAD, AND IN SOME SPOTS IN THE TREAD ITSELF, ON THE LAST TWO ORIGINAL TIRES.  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE REGARDING THE RECALL AND WAS TOLD TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN TO HAVE THE TIRES CHECKED.  I BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO FIRESTONE AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD OR WOULD DO SINCE THE TIRES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  I CONTACTED NHTSA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE RECALL MIGHT BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THESE TIRES IN THE FUTURE.  I EXPERIENCED LOSS OF TIRE PRESSURE ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND HAD TO PUT AIR INTO THE TIRES AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK (THE TIRES WERE FILLED TO 30 LBS. PSI, NOT AT THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED PRESSURE).  SINCE WE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE TIRES, WE HAVE REPLACED THEM.  IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN EXAMINING THEM, WE STILL HAVE THEM IN OUR POSSESSION.  THE EXPLORER IS USED PRIMARILY UNDER MODERATE SPEED AND SHORT DISTANCE CONDITIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, DRIVING TO THE STORE.

SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT REIMBURSE HER BECAUSE: THE TIRES WERE REPLACED 3 DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS NOTIFIED, SAM'S CLUB MIGHT HAVE SOLD THE TIRES TAKEN OFF THE VEHICLE, SHE COULD NOT PRODUCE THE TIRES FOR THEM, AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE OF THE TIRES.  THIS IS BULL. FORD CAN TELL BY THEIR RECORDS WHAT TIRES WERE ON THE VEHICLE AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM. FIRESTONE CAN ALSO CHECK WITH THE SELLING DEALER'S MECHANIC TO VERIFY THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES. ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO USE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT UNTIL THE RECALL STARTS AND HOPE YOU DON'T DIE BECAUSE OF IT?

I HAD THE TIRES INSPECTED AGAIN BY THIS SERVICE GARAGE AND THEY GAVE ME THE TIRE NUMBERS SO I COULD GO TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER.

DURING THE TIME I HAD THESE TIRES ON MY TRUCK, I WAS INVOLVED IN 2 ACCIDENTS.  WHEN THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO ALIGN MY VEHICLE AFTER THE 2ND ACCIDENT, I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER TIRE SHOP (WINSTON TIRES, CANYON COUNTRY, CA), TO HAVE THE ALIGNMENT DONE, AND ON INSPECTING THE TIRES, THEY FOUND THAT THE 2 OF THE TIRES WERE BEGINNING TO SEPARATE, AND AN ALIGNMENT COULD NOT BE PERFORMED.  I REPLACED THE TIRES WITH BF GOODRICH ALL TERRAIN TIRES, AFTER WHICH I WAS ABLE TO ALIGN THE TRUCK.  WITH THE NEW TIRES I FOUND THAT MY EXPLORER'S HANDLING, BRAKING, STEERING, AND TRACTION WERE CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED.  I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THE ORIGINAL TIRES WHICH FIRESTONE HAS GENEROUSLY OFFERED ME $10/ TIRE FOR SINCE I REPLACED THE WILDERNESS AT TIRES PRIOR TO 1/1/2000.  I FEEL THAT FIRESTONE SHOULD PAY FOR MY REPLACEMENT TIRES REGARDLESS OF WHEN I PURCHASED THEM.  I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WHERE SUMMERTIME TEMPERATURES REGULARLY EXCEED 100 DEGREES, AND THE HIGHWAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRAVEL.  PLEASE CONTACT ME IF I CAN OFFER ANY FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE TIRES, WHICH I CONSIDERED THE WORST TIRES I EVER HAD, EVEN BEFORE THE RECALL BEGAN, AND FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED THIS IN FORD QUALITY QUESTIONAIRES THAT THEY WERE NOT DOING THEMSELVES A FAVOR BY PUTTING THESE TIRES ON THEIR TRUCKS.*AK (DOT NUMBER: W2XXXXX  TIRESIZE: 255 70 16)",

AS THEY WERE SWITCHING THE TIRES, THE KAUFMAN REP CAME TO THE WAITING AREA TO TELL ME - \"YOU REALLY DODGED A BULLET\".

THEY TOLD ME NOT TO DRIVE ON IT. AS IF WAS NOT SAFE AND HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED. I WAS IN SHOCK AS I HAD MY GRANDCHILDREN IN THE EXPLORER A FEW DAY BEFORE. I WAS CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS SO I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT FIVE NEW TIRES.WE WERE PLANNING TO DRIVE FROM FLORIDA TO PORTLAND, OREGON ON THE ORIGINAL FIRESTONE TIRES. SINCE I AM RETIRED AND SO NOT DRIVE VERY MUCH I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO BUY NEW TIRES FOR SOMETIME AS THEY ONLY HAD 32,400 PLUS MILES ON THEM. I AM INFORMING YOU OF THIS HOPING THAT SOMEONE ELSE THAT MIGHT BE PLANNING A LONG TRIP ON THE FIRESTONE TIRES NOT INVOLVED IN THE RECALL WILL RECONSIDER. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE.( DOT NUMBER: W2HLIPY446 TIRE SIZE: P235/75R15 )",

THERE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-FOURTH INCH TREAD LEFT ON THESE TIRES.  I HAVE BEEN INSPECTING EACH OF THE VEHICLE'S TIRES BEFORE AND AFTER EACH DAY'S COMMUTE.  I NOTICED SMALL FRACTURES DEVELOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TREAD WHERE IT MEETS THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE.  BOTH REAR TIRES EXHIBITED THE SMALL FRACTURES.  DURING THE LAST INSPECTION (ON 08/23/00), I NOTICED THE FRACTURES WIDENING SIGNIFICANTLY.  AT LEAST ONE OF THE FRACTURES ON THE OUTER SIDE OF THE LEFT REAR TIRE EXHIBITED STEEL WIRES PROTRUDING FROM THE BULGE.

I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TO THIS STORE COMPLAINING OF WOBLE AT SPEED. THEY CLAIMED THE TIRES (ALL VD CODE) WERE GOOD, AND THE ALIGNMENT BY FORD DEALER WAS BAD. MY FORD DEALER HAD INSPECTED TIRES AND ALIGNMENT 7 MONTHS EARLIER AND SAID THE TIRES WERE BAD.  I DID NOT INSTALL THE REPLACEMENT NEW TIRE SINCE THE RECALL NEWS CAME THE FOLLOWING DAY. SO I USED MY SPARE, DOT CODED W2HL WHILE RECALL ISSUES WERE BEING RESOLVED.  TODAY I WAS DRIVING AT 70 MPH IN TEXAS, 107 DEGREES AT THE TIME. THE CAR STARTED WOBBLING SEVERLY, AND I SLOWED DOWN. THE ENTIRE TREAD OF THE TIRE THEN FLEW OFF, AFTER CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE CAR. THE TIRE DID NOT BLOW OUT, FORTUNATLEY. I WALKED BACK DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND RETRIEVED THE TREAD IF ANYONE WANTS TO INSPECT IT. THIS WAS MY SPARE TIRE, ALSO MOUNTED ON RIGHT FRONT, AND IT WAS A SUPPOSEDLY GOOD DOT CODE. I HAVE HAD TWO DEFECTIVES IN 3 WEEKS ON THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE SAME CAR. I WAS CARRYING 30 LBS PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE SECOND FAILURE. I PUT THE NEW SPARE ON, DROVE TO A TIRE STORE AND BOUGHT 4 TIRES. I RETAINED ALL FOUR BAD TIRES (3 ARE DOT VD, AND THE OTHER  W2HL.  I BELIEVE YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR OTHER BAD DOT PLANT CODES. I ALSO THINK THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE FORD SUSPENSION, BASED ON SEVERAL MECHANICS REPORTING TO ME THAT THE EXPLORERS ALL EXHIBIT AN UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR PATTERN.

I WAS LEARY ABOUT DRIVING THE EXPLORER ON INTERSTATE 95 FROM BALTIMORE TO DELAWARE BUT HAD TO JOIN MY WIFE WHO WAS ASSISTING HER 85 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO IS RECOVERING FROM A BROKEN PELVIS IN WILMINGTON. RETURNING HOME AT ABOUT 10:15 PM FROM WILMINGTON, DEL. TO BALTIMORE, MD. ON WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 23, THE EXPLORER STARTED TO SWIM ON THE ROAD, NOTICEABLY SWERVING. JUST THEN A MAN IN A CAR ON MY RIGHT STARTED YELLING AT ME AND POINTING TO THE REAR OF MY VEHICLE. I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG AND PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY. THE TIRE WAS FLAT. ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT A \"BLOWOUT\" AS HAS CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS IN EXPLORERS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE TIRE WENT FLAT QUICKLY, IN A COUPLE MINUTES AT MOST. WHEN I TOOK OFF THE TIRE AND LOOKED INSIDE, THERE WERE LARGE AIR BUBBLES INSIDE THE TIRE. IN ADDITION, THE TIRE WAS SHREDDED IN SEVERAL SECTIONS INSIDE. THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRE WAS MUSHY AND SPONGEY. EARLY ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, I TOOK THE TIRE TO THE FIRESTONE TIRE CENTER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I HAD HIT SOMETHING ON THE ROAD THAT HAD CAUSED THE TIRE TO LOSE AIR. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO PUNCTURE AND THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE WAS OBVIOUSLY RIPPED APART RATHER EXTENSIVELY. WHEN WE CONSULTED WITH OTHER TIRE DEALERS ABOUT THE CONDITION OF OUR OTHER THREE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE THEY POINTED OUT THE CRACKS ALL ALONG THE EDGE OF THE TREAD, INDICATING THAT THE TREAD IS NOTICEABLY BEGINNING TO SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE TIRE.

THE SERIES OF CRACKS WERE NOT PRESENT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND HAS OCCURED OVER THE LAST YEAR.  I FIRST NOTICED THESE CRACKS AFTER RETURNING FROM A TRIP TO COLUMBUS, OHIO LAST JUNE.

MY DAUGHTER EVEN REMARKED AT HOW BADLY THE CAR WAS SHAKING.  I SLOWED THE SPEED TO 55 MPH.  AS I DROVE SOUTH ON I-45 , TOWARDS THE PIERCE ST. EXIT,  IN THE INSIDE LANE, I HEARD A LOUD POP, AND SAW A BLACK PIECE OF RUBBER, AND SOMETHING SHINY  RIP AWAY FROM THE  LEFT, REAR OF MY VEHICLE. MY  VEHICLE BEGAN TO GO OUT OF CONTROL, BUT I MANAGED TO STEER IT TO THE INSIDE SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY.  MY SISTER WHO WAS FOLLOWING ME STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME AND GOT OUT OF HER CAR.  WE BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT SHE TOLD ME WAS THAT MY LEFT, REAR TIRE HAD COME APART.  SURE ENOUGH, THE REAR, LEFT TIRE TREAD HAD TORN  COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE TIRE.  AFTER I CONTACTED MY HUSBAND, AND MANAGED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE OFF THE FREEWAY, WE NOTICED THAT THE TREAD HAD CUT THE HOSES TO THE GAS TANK, EXPOSING THE MAIN LINE TO THE GAS TANK.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE COULD NO LONGER DRIVE THE CAR, AND HAD TO HAVE A WRECKER TAKE THE VEHICLE TO LOCAL FORD DEALER IN TOWN.  *AK( DOT NUMBER:   TIRE SIZE: P235/75R15 )",

HE INDICATED THAT THE TIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN RUN ON LOW AIR PRESSURE. NATURALLY I COULD NOT DISPROVE HIS THEORY. I PURCHASED TWO NEW TIRES BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF THE SAME THING HAPPENING AGAIN. I TOLD THE DEALER THAT I WOULD BE BACK TO REPLACE THE OTHER TWO WHEN I HAD THE MONEY TO DO SO.

IF YOU FIND THAT OTHER SIZES ARE AT FAULT, PLEASE CONSIDER THE PEOPLE THAT HAD THEM SWITCHED UPON ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE ORIGINAL RECALL.

ALSO PLEASE CONSIDER THAT THE SIZE THEY RECALLED IS THE MOST POPULAR OF THE FIRESTONE'S INSTALLED ON EXPLORERS, BUT THE 16\" WHEEL IS AN OPTION ON THE VEHICLE.  SO IF \"MOST\" OF THE ACCIDENTS OCCURED ON THE 15\" THAT WOULD JIVE WITH THE RATIO !!  ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE VEHICLES SOLD IN THE SOUTH ARE THE ONES WITH PROBLEMS... MAYBE BECAUSE OF HEAT AS REPORTED. . DOES FORD SHIP VEHICLES FROM SPECIFIC ASSEMBLY PLANTS TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ?

I WENT THROUGH A REPLACEMENT ON 12/11/98 THAT SEEMS TO BE SIMILAR TO THE RECALL PROBLEMS, WHERE I FOUND THE TREADS ON MY REAR TIRES TO BE SPLITTING AND STARTING TO SEPARATE FROM THE TIRE. I HAD THE TWO REAR TIRES INSPECTED AND REPLACED AT THE FIRESTONE DEALER IN GASTONIA, NC AFTER PAYING A REDUCED PRICE DUE TO PRORATION ACCORDING TO TREAD WEAR SINCE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE STILL UNDER THE TIRE WARRANTY PERIOD (33,185 MILES). THIS ALSO BRINGS UP ANOTHER CONCERN, WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, SINCE THEY ARE RECALLING THESE TIRES, WILL I BE REIMBURSED FOR THE MONIES SPENT IN REPLACING THE FIRST TWO TIRES DUE TO THE DEFECT? I STILL HAVE TWO OF THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY EXPLORER AND SINCE I LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA (ALSO A HOT STATE), I AM CONCERNED ON HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE FIRESTONE GETS THE RECALL TO THOSE OF US WHO DON'T LIVE IN THE FIRST TWO PHASED STATE GROUPS FOR THE RECALL.

WE DEPARTED FROM FARMINGTON HILLS MI (DETROIT) AT 9:30AM IN A LIGHT SNOW.  IT WORSENED AS WE GOT INTO OHIO, BUT THE ROADS WERE CLEARED AND IN SOME AREAS WERE SALTED.  MOST TRAFFIC WAS MOVING AT APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH IN ONE LANE, THE FAR RIGHT ONE CLOSEST TO THE SHOULDER.  THAT IS WHERE I WAS WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  SHORTLY AFTER WE STARTED THE TRIP I HEARD A SERIES OF LOUD NOISES FROM UNDER THE CAR. MY SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE (SUV), A 1997 FORD EXPLORER, HAS A SERIES OF SETTINGS FOR 4 WHEEL DRIVE (4WD), I.E., AUTO 4WD, 4WD HIGH, AND 4WD LOW.  AT THE TIME I BELIEVED THE NOISE TO BE THE CAR SHIFTING FROM 2WD TO 4WD AS IT SENSED THE ROAD CONDITIONS.  I ATTEMPTED TO SET IT TO 4WD, BUT THE NOISE CONTINUED.  SINCE THE NOISE DID NOT STOP I SET IT BACK TO THE SETTING I HAD IT IN MOST OF THE TIME.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1PM, I AM CERTAIN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED LOCKING THE WHEELS, WHICH PUT ME INTO A SPIN. DURING THE SPIN THE CAR ROLLED OVER, WENT IN AND OUT OF A DITCH (LOCATED TO THE RIGHT OF THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD) ON ITS SIDE, AND EVENTUALLY SETTLED RIGHT SIDE UP WITH THE FRONT OF THE CAR POINTED DOWNWARD INTO THE DITCH TOWARD THE HIGHWAY. I CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE CAR IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AT SUBURBAN COLLISION CENTER, 1151 WEST BAGLEY ROAD, BUREA, OH 44017 (440) 243-5533.  *AK",

INITIALLY THE CABLE WAS LOOKED AT AND LUBRICATION APPLIED, BUT DID NOT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM.  CHARLES GABUS FORD THEN SUGGESTED REPLACEMENT OF THE THROTTLE BODY.  THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN 2 MONTHS OF PURCHASE AND ALLEVIATED THE PROBLEM FOR A FEW MONTHS.  WHEN THE PROBLEM REOCCURED, CHARLES GABUS KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR 3-4 DAYS TO FURTHER INSPECT THE PROBLEM TO SEE WHETHER DISCONNECTING THE CRUISE CONTROL HAD ANY EFFECT.  IT DID NOT, SO THE THROTTLE BODY WAS CHANGED AGAIN.  THIS WAS AROUND FEBRUARY 1998.  THE PROBLEM ONCE AGAIN STARTED OCCURING IN AUGUST 1998.  AT THAT TIME, I HAD JUST MOVED TO ST. LOUIS, BUT WAS STILL WORKING WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AT CHARLES GABUS FORD IN DES MOINES.  I WAS TOLD THAT FORD HAD NOW REDESIGNED THE THROTTLE BODY AND I WAS GIVEN THAT NEW PART NUMBER, WHICH WAS ORDERED AND REPLACED BY A DEALERSHIP IN ST. LOUIS (MCMAHON FORD) IN SEPTEMBER 1998.  THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AT THAT TIME.  IN MAY 1999, I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FORD THAT IT WAS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL WARRANTY COVERGE FOR THE THROTTLE BODY FOR 6 YEARS OR 72,000 MILES UNDER SERVICE PROGRAM NUMBER 99M02.  IN SEPTEMBER 1999, THE PROBLEM RESURFACED AND THE THROTTLE BODY IS SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED THIS WEEK.  THE CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE JUST VERIFIED THAT THE THROTTLE BODY TOUTED AS THE SOLUTION IN THE LETTER IS THE SAME THROTTLE BODY PART NUMBER REPLACED A YEAR AGO.
