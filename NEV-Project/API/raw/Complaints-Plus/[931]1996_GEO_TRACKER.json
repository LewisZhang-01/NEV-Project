WE CHECKED THE CAR IN WITH A DEALER WHO INFORMED US THAT THE BOLT HOLDING THE TIMING BELT ASSEMBLY TO THE CRANK CASE HAD COME UNSCREWED AND TORN APART OUR CRANKCASE.  3 MECHANICS STATED THAT THIS WAS IRREPAIRABLE AND REQUIRED A NEW ENGINE FOR THE CAR.  THE DEALER TOLD US THAT THIS SCREW COULD ONLY COME LOOSE DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE TIMING BELT - SPECIFICALLY THAT THE MECHANIC HAD FAILED TO TIGHTEN IT PROPERLY.  WHEN I BROUGH THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF MY MECHABIC, HE PROMPTLY PRODUCED CHEVY'S PUBLISHED REPAIR GUIDE WHICH CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS BOLT IS NOT TO BE UNSCREWED DURING TIMING BELT REPLACEMENT.  THIS LEAVES ONLY 1 OTHER POSSIBILITY - THE BOLT WAS NOT PROPERLY TIGHTENED AT THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY.  WHEN I BROUGHT THIS TO THE DEALER'S ATTENTION THEY WERE QUITE RUDE AND INFORMED THAT I WAS ON MY OWN SINCE I HAD NOT USED A DEALER FOR THE REPAIR.  CALLS TO CHEVY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE WERE HANDLED IN THE SAME CONDESCENDING MANNER.  EMAILS TO THE COPANY HAVE GONE UNANSWERED.  THE COPANY DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE THAT A DEFAULT IN THEIR MANUFACTURING PUT MY FAMILY AT RISK.
