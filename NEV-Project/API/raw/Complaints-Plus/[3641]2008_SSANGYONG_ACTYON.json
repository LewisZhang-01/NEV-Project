AFTER BUILDING THE TRUCK TO A RUNNING CONDITION, I AM TOLD BY MY STATE VEHICLE INSPECTION REPRESENTATIVE THAT THE BRAND IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE TITLED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AT ALL, DUE TO YOUR RULES.      HOW IS IT THAT YOU ALLOW THEM TO BE SOLD AT ALL, IF YOU WILL NOT TITLE THEM? WHAT FEATURES MAKE THE VEHICLE SO UNSAFE THAT IT CANNOT BE TITLED?    WILL YOU FURNISH ME A LETTER STATING THAT THE VEHICLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE LICENSED IN ANY STATE, SO THAT I CAN PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE SELLER TO RECOVER MY LOSSES, PLEASE?",
