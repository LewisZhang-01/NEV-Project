AN INOPERATIVE CHARGINIG SYSTEM CAN RESULT IN AN ENGINE STALL, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  this recall has never been addressed and it is my feeling that HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA is just letting it go without corrective actions until all of the models are off the road and they don't have to address this at all, also the problem is well understated as the oil not only gets on the alternator but the belt system that poses an even mere berater risk.  if the NHTSA will monitor each safety recall to make sure owners receive safe, free, and effective remedies from manufacturers according to the Safety Act and Federal regulations, than why are they not addressing this?  Although my car had 293000 miles on it it could have made another 200000 miles if HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA would have taken steps to correct this?  after sending an email (will upload) they seemed to question me on the vehicle but after learning a junked the car they appear to take the stand that that owe me nothing not even the time of day, and I would like to file a formal complaint against HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA for lack effort to resolve this issue as this year alone I have gotten 5 recall notices stating no repair available?",

THE RECALL DESCRIBES THE FOLLOWING: \"A STOP LAMP SWITCH MALFUNCTION MAY ALSO AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE BRAKE-TRANSMISSION SHIFT INTERLOCK FEATURE SO THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SHIFTED OUT OF THE PARK POSITION. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ESC) MALFUNCTION LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.\"   FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS THE ESC LIGHT ON MY 2007 VERACRUZ HAS ILLUMINATED PERIODICALLY WHILE DRIVING OR WHEN STARTING THE CAR, AND IT WILL REMAIN ON UNTIL THE ENGINE IS SHUT OFF. PRESSING THE ESC ON/OFF BUTTON ON THE DASH WILL NOT SHUT THE LIGHT OFF WHILE IN PARK OR DRIVING. TURNING THE CAR OFF IS THE ONLY WAY TO TURN THE LIGHT OFF. I CONTACTED THE LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM, THEIR ANSWER WAS THAT THE LIGHT ILLUMINATING IS NORMAL AND NOT TO WORRY.   ALSO, FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS, PERIODICALLY THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHIFTER WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF PARK. YOU MUST SHUT OFF AND RESTART THE CAR A FEW TIMES FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO OPERATE.

I SENT IN ALL PAPERWORK REQUIRED AND WAITED.  I PHONED IN TO SEE WHAT THE DELAY WAS, THEY WERE MISSING OUR PROOF OF PAYMENT RECEIPT.  I SENT THAT IN AND WAITED SOME MORE.  EACH TIME I CALLED I HAD A NEW \"CASE WORKER\" BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE(S) WERE NO LONGER WORKING THERE.  EACH TIME MY CASE MUST HAVE BEEN PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STACK.  EACH TIME THEY PROMISED TO EXPEDITE MY CLAIM.  I'M STILL WAITING.   NOT ONLY THAT, THEY RECALL REPAIR WORK DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM.  WE KEEP GETTING \"FLUID\" LEAKING ONTO THE ALTERNATOR.  THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING MORE UNLESS HYUNDAI PUTS OUT ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE.  I WON'T BUY HYUNDAI AGAIN!",

THE REPAIR SHOP MANAGER OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE CAR AT A VERY REDUCED PRICE ($1600.00), WHICH WE ACCEPTED. MY SON USED THE FUNDS AS A DOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW CAR.    APPROXIMATELY THREE WEEKS LATER, I RECEIVED A SAFETY RECALL LETTER FROM HYUNDAI CONCERNING OUR RECENTLY SOLD VERACRUZ (NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 14V-415). THE LETTER INCLUDED A SECTION EXPLAINING REIMBURSEMENT CONSIDERATION FOR PREVIOUS REPAIRS. THE RECALL INVOLVES ENGINE OIL LEAKING ONTO THE ALTERNATOR AND DAMAGING IT ALONG WITH THE VEHICLE CHARGING CENTER. WE HAVE REPLACED OUR ALTERNATOR THREE TIMES AND HAD A MAJOR ELECTRICAL SHUTDOWN JUST TWO YEARS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE.    I CALLED THE CUSTOMER CARE CENTER TO EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION. I WAS TOLD THAT  BECAUSE WE HAD SOLD THE VEHICLE, WE WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REPAIR (OBVIOUSLY) OR REPAIR REIMBURSEMENT. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT I HAVE PAID OVER $2,000.00 OVER THE YEARS FOR REPAIRS QUITE POSSIBLY CAUSED BY THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, I BELIEVE THE TIMING BELT ISSUE WHICH LED TO THE FINAL $1650.00 REPAIR ESTIMATE MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THIS RECALL PROBLEM. MAYBE NOT.

SO CALLED NEXT DAY, DEALER ASKED FOR MORE MONEY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM IN THE CAR AND EVEN MORE MONEY IF THERE ARE ANY REPAIRS NEEDED. CALLED HYUNDAI ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DEALER'S UNWILLINGNESS TO CHECK WHY THE AIR BAG SIGN IS ON BUT HYUNDAI DID NOTHING. FRUSTRATED WITH ROUTE 4 HYUNDAI DEALER IN PARAMUS, NJ. HYUNDAI OWNERS BEWARE OF THOSE SCAMMERS. FIRST THEY WILL SCREW UP THE CAR AND THEN ASK FOR MORE MONEY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.

THE DEALER STATED THEY TEST DROVE IT FOR 30 MILES TO ENSURE THERE WERE NO ISSUES, AND THEN RETURNED THE CAR TO US.      FOLLOWING THAT THE CAR WAS DRIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT UNTIL IT OCCURRED AGAIN ON 9/17/08, WITH MY WIFE DRIVING OUR YOUNG DAUGHTER AGAIN. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THE FOLLOWING ERRORS APPEARED:      2135 - THROTTLE BODY   2106 - ?  1295 - ?     I WAS ADVISED A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED TO DEALERS IN FEBRUARY FOR THIS, AND THEY WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY UNIT, WHICH WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.   THE DEALER STATED THEY HAD REPLACED THE UNIT ON 3-4 CARS TO DATE AND THAT IT TOOK CARE OF THE ISSUE I WAS HAVING.     FOLLOWING THE THROTTLE BODY UNIT REPLACEMENT, WE HAD NO FURTHER ISSUES UNTIL LAST NIGHT.  ON THE WAY HOME FROM DINNER, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING OUR DAUGHTER AGAIN, THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED, 6/26/09.      THIS MAKES THREE TIMES IN LESS THAN A YEAR.  I HAVE NOTICED THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE BASED ON SIMILAR REPORTS OF OTHER OWNERS IN ONLINE FORUMS.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS OCCURRED.  FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NOT ANY INJURIES OR DAMAGE.       MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.  IF SHE HAD BEEN PASSING ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL.  I NOTE THAT FROM POSTINGS ON ONLINE FORUMS THERE HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTS DUE TO THIS ISSUE. *TR",

IN FACT HE SAID HE DRIVES A VERACRUZ AND HAS SEEN THE HORIZONTAL LINE THAT WE MENTIONED. ASKED WHAT HYUNDAI WAS DOING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM HE REPLIED NOTHING. HE SAID HYUNDAI ASSUMES THAT THE PROBLEM IS NATURE TO THE HIGH OUTPUT LIGHTS USED AND THEY DO NOT INTEND TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.    A LETTER OF COMPLAINT TO THE VICE PRESIDENTS OF SERVICE AND SALES AT HYUNDAI WENT UNANSWERED.  *TR",
