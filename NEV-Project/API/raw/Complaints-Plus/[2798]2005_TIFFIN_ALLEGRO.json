THE ABS SENSOR LIGHT REMAINED ILLUMINATED AFTER THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS WERE REPLACED. ANOTHER INDEPENDENT MECHANIC STATED THAT THE SENSORS WERE MELTING TO THE FRAME WHICH CAUSED THE ABS LIGHT TO STAY ON.   THE ABS SENSOR AND CALIPERS WERE REPLACED. THE CONTACT NOTIFIED THE MANUFACTURER REGARDING REIMBURSEMENT AND THE CLAIM WAS DENIED SINCE THE CALIPERS WERE BEING REPLACED. THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 0 AND THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 34,795.",
