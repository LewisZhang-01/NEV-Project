The answers to the specific questions are below.  \u2022What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The Dexter rear axle bent and Lippert Frame cracked on the rear axle above the shackle points causing the tires to wear unevenly prematurely ending the tire life. \u2022How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? The structural integrity of the camper is now compromised creating a potential to cause unwarranted catastrophic damage to myself and others. \u2022Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes \u2022Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No, only our RV dealership and passed NYS inspection in October 2020 for the 2021 year before the major problems were known. \u2022Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? Uneven tire wear was the first noticeable symptom in late summer of 2020.",
