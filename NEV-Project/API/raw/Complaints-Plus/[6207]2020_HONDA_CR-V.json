        "summary": "In September of 2020 I purchased a brand new 2020 Honda CR-V Touring with 235/55R19 CrossContact LX Sport M+S tires. On April 3, 2022 I was on a trip away (several hundred miles) from home when my 17 year old daughter (who drives the CR-V) contacted me about one tire that was low on air. She sent me a photo. I informed her to put air in the tire to see if it continued to leak and I would fix it when I got home. Taking initiative, she asked me if she could fix it while I was away. I gave her inspection instructions. She carefully inspected the tire and found no outside defects such as screw/nail/puncture foreign material. Since the leak was very slow, she filled the tire with air and safely drove the car to Firestone Tire at 395 Eisenhower Dr, Hanover, PA 17331. Once she got there the tire technician attempted to find the leak. He was unable to find any outside defect or leak and continued by removing the tire from the rim. I then got a phone call from my daughter who had the technician on speakerphone. He described the issue to me as a tire manufacturing defect that he has never seen before. My daughter then texted me photos of the issue. The defect is easily seen on the inside molded lines in the sidewall. It is where the bead rolls into the sidewall. In the molded lines there are areas where the lines are interrupted/missing and with what appears to be several small holes in the rubber. Firestone could not advise how to proceed. The tire was remounted. The technician put a little extra tire sealant on the bead. She then drove the vehicle home. I have since also read the these tires, of other sizes, have had a vulcanizing problem. My tire clearly has this issue and Continental needs to update their recall list to include these as well.",

Although I realized the car was accelerating and lurching forward, the brake was not stopping the vehicle. The car jumped the parking curb and crashed into the building causing damage to both the exterior and interior wall of the doctor's waiting room. While neither myself, my passenger, nor any patients in the waiting room were injured, someone could have been. The air bags did not deploy, and the Collision Mitigation system did not engage preventing the collision. Damage to the vehicle consisted of mostly front bumper and grill damage. When I called the local Honda dealership service department asking if I should have them evaluate the car before having body work completed, I was told that the dealership does not accept damaged cars until the body work has been completed. Consequently, I had the car towed to a body shop even though it was technically drivable.  I did not feel safe driving the vehicle fearing it would suddenly accelerate again.   I reported the incident to the Honda corporate office and a case was opened. I was again told that damage to the car had to be repaired by the body shop before the car would be evaluated by Honda. When the body shop completed the repairs, I had the car towed to the local Honda dealership for evaluation. I specifically requested that the Event Data Recorder be evaluated, but I received conflicting answers when I asked if it had been accessed during the inspection. I was told that the Honda District Representative reviewed the data from the inspection and invoice states, \"no defects in materials or factory workmanship were found (NAME of tech) inspected and found no issues, relayed information to Honda and they advised the vehicle is ok to drive at this time\". The vehicle was released back to me, but I refuse to drive it.",

Good morning, I have had trouble with Apple Car Play since I purchased my new vehicle. I called the dealership in November and asked how to fix it. They suggested to try an apple USB/IPhone charger so I tried varies different USB cords and got them to work for awhile. In Jan. 2021 my Apple Car Play just stopped working all together. I would plug in my phone and the car would tell me that this function is not available. Then when I did occasionally get it to work, about 5 minutes into my drive. My touch screen monitor would turn completely black and I wouldn\u2019t be able to use any other functions, even after turning my car off and back on, the screen would remain black until the next time I drove it. It works for a short period of time after doing a factory reset but only for about 12 hours, then it either turns black or the message \u201cthis function is unavailable\u201d pops up and my device isn\u2019t detected. I can\u2019t even use the iPod function just to play music, it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t recognize my phone, yet it will charge my phone. It just won\u2019t recognize anything else. I have brought it into the dealer 6 times regarding this issue before the last two attempts to fix it, I even called apple support as recommended by the dealership. They were aware of the issue and told me to wait until the next update for it to be fixed. So I did... and it still didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s when I went in two more times and no one can seem to figure out what\u2019s wrong. Thank you for your time, I hope we can resolve this issue soon. Have a great day! Cassie  I had sent in multiple documents and a testimony explaining my cars defect and due to that defect the loss of use, value and safety to the vehicle. My request to fix this defect was denied.

On 5/9/2021, I started my CR-V only to have multiple system failure warnings scrolling across the dash.  On 5/10/2021, I took the vehicle to the dealership.  They found a blown fuse (P/N 38221-SNA-A41) but were not able to determine why it blew.  On 5/25/2021, the same problem reoccurred.  I took the vehicle that day to the dealership.  The only difference was that (at least as I knew at the time) was that both failures happened after I used the remote start function. On 5/26/2021, after many attempts to duplicate the problem using remote start, the dealership contacted me saying they needed to do more troubleshooting. On 5/27/2021, The dealership contacted me saying they had determined the problem was a short in the above-mentioned harness and asked if I had hung anything on it.  I mentioned that I occasionally hung my Handicap Placard (net weight 0.7 ounces) on it, but it would also be bumped by the windshield sunshade I use.  The service advisor said that the repairs were not covered under the warranty since it was something I did, and not the fault of the vehicle.  I asked the dealership to provide me with the damaged harness for my inspection, and the service advisor agreed to that. When the vehicle was returned to me on 6/4/2021, the harness was not in the vehicle, nor, according to the service advisor, in the building.  I am an engineer with years of experience in cabling and harnesses, I wanted to see the damage for myself, as well as what physical harness strain relief accommodations were made for it.  When the second incident happened, we were near home, and the dealership.  It could have happened a week later when we were on our vacation and driving through the middle of the wheat fields of Kansas - stranded.",

THE OIL SMELLED FAINTLY OF GASOLINE AND APPEARED THINNER THAN NORMAL.  SEE ATTACHED PICTURE.  WE LIVE IN A TOWN OF 22,000.  MOST TRIPS AROUND TOWN ARE 2 MILES EACH WAY AT MOST, WHICH ACCORDING TO HONDA IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AS THE ENGINE DOES NOT RUN AT NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE LONG ENOUGH TO EVAPORATE FUEL IN THE CRANKCASE.  WE DO TAKE OCCASIONAL TRIPS OF AN HOUR OR MORE EACH DIRECTION.  HONDA SAYS THIS PROBLEM IS MADE WORSE BY COLD CLIMATES, HOWEVER, OUR WINTER WHERE WE LIVE HAD BEEN VERY MILD COMPARED TO MOST WINTERS WHEN OUR OIL WAS CHANGED.  MOST DAYS THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP HAD BEEN IN THE 30'S TO LOW 40'S.  I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MY HONDA DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND HONDA HAS NO FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.

AT TWO MONTHS OLD, HONDA DETECTED IT IN BOTH MY CAR AND TWO OTHER NEW ONES THEY PULLED FROM THEIR LOT TO SEE IF IT WAS IN ANY OTHER NEW ONES.  I WAS TOLD \"THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME ISSUE ONLY WORSE THAN YOURS\".  ORIGINALLY I NOTICED IT AT 63 MPH (SO DID THE SHOP FOREMAN WHO DROVE IT WITH ME), BUT NOW, I'M EXPERIENCING IT ON SURFACE STREETS AS WELL.  IT REMAINS CONSTANT REGARDLESS OF ACCELERATION OR DECELERATION.  THE DEALERSHIP MADE EVERY ATTEMPT TO CORRECT IT - TRIED NEW TIRE(S), REAR ALIGNMENT, ETC.  THEY TEST DROVE IT MORE THAN ONCE, BUT IN THE END, THEY ADMITTED TO ME THAT IT WAS STILL THERE AND LIKELY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS MODEL.  \"DRIVE TRAIN\" WAS MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE.  I DID TEST DRIVE IT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AND WHILE IT DID FEEL A BIT DIFFERENT FROM MY 2017 CR-V, I ATTRIBUTED IT TO ME NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO AWD.  HOWEVER, THE MORE I'VE DRIVEN IT, THE MORE I REALIZE IT'S SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT I WOULD BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ON A LONG TRIP.  ALL THIS SAID, THE ISSUE OF SAFETY KEEPS LOOMING - IF IT IS THE DRIVE TRAIN, IS IT WEARING DOWN ALREADY (NOT BEING MECHANICALLY MINDED, DOES A DRIVE TRAIN WEAR DOWN?) AND AT WHAT POINT MIGHT IT CAUSE A REAL PROBLEM AT HIGH SPEED (OR ANY SPEED!)?  FOR CLARITY - THE CAR HAS NEVER BEEN DRIVEN ROUGHLY NOR HIT ANY OBSTACLE OR CURB.  I AM WRITING A LETTER TO HONDA CORPORATE OFFICES AS WELL.  A SHOUT OUT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON AT MY HONDA DEALER.  I KNOW FIRST YEAR REVAMP (FIRST YEAR OF CR-V HYBRID IN THIS CASE) CAN BE TRICKY AND VERY POSSIBLY IS IN THIS INSTANCE.  EVERYONE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL AND WORKED HARD TO TRY AND PINPOINT THE PROBLEM.

IT IS FIRMLY LOCKED/JAMMED IN PLACE.  IN SOME INSTANCES, I CAN APPLY VERY FIRM PRESSURE ON THE PEDAL, JUST ENOUGH TO GET THE ENGINE TO START, BUT IN OTHER CASES, THE PEDAL CANNOT BE DEPRESSED AT ALL.  WHEN THIS OCCURS, PRESSING THE 'START' BUTTON INITIATES THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS BUT DOES NOT START THE ENGINE.  ONCE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ARE ON, THE PEDAL SOMETIMES REMAINS FIRMLY LOCKED, AND OTHER TIMES MAY SLIGHTLY SOFTEN TO THE POINT THAT I CAN PRESS THE START BUTTON AGAIN AND START THE ENGINE.  DURING INSTANCES WHEN THE PEDAL REMAINS FIRMLY LOCKED, I MAY HAVE TO PRESS THE 'START' BUTTON SEVERAL TIMES, CYCLING ELECTRONICS ON AND OFF BEFORE THE PEDAL EVENTUALLY SOFTENS ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE ENGINE TO START. THE PEDAL ISSUE SEEMS RANDOM, REGARDLESS OF WARM OR COLD ENGINE, TERRAIN, WEATHER CONDITIONS, USE OF PARKING BRAKE, PRESSING THE PEDAL REPEATEDLY, ETC. BASED ON OTHER SIMILAR ONLINE REVIEWS, THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT THE PEDAL CAN LOCK WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, CAUSING A LOSS OF BRAKING CAPABILITY IN AFFECTED VEHICLES INCLUDING CR-V, PILOT, AND RIDGELINE. SPECULATIVE CAUSES MAY BE A BRAKE VACUUM/BOOSTER DEFECT. TWO LOCAL DEALERSHIPS CLAIMED THEY ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM AND A TECHNICIAN REVIEWING THE VEHICLE SAID EVERYTHING WAS WORKING FINE, SO THEY APPARENTLY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE JAMMED BRAKE PEDAL IN PERSON.  *TR",
