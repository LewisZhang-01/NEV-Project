IT HAPPENS WITHIN 1-2 SECONDS AFTER COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP WITH THE CAR IN NEUTRAL. IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BUT THEN EASILY STARTS AGAIN. IT'S A VERY GENTLE STALL AND ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE CAR HAS AUTO STOP/START, WHICH MY CAR DOES NOT. FORTUNATELY, THE DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO RECREATE THE STALLING. THEY EVEN CONTACTED AND WORKED WITH VWOA BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. THEY HAD THE CAR FOR CLOSE TO 2 WEEKS TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT FIXES, BUT NONE WORKED. SO WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, THEY DID A 'CAPACITIVE HARD REBOOT' OF THE SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE FIXED. HOWEVER, AFTER I PICKED THE CAR UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP, IT STALLED TWICE ON MY DRIVE HOME. NOW, IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE THEN AND IT HASN'T STALLED SINCE, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE ME MUCH CONFIDENCE THAT IT WON'T RETURN IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REBOOT DID.",
