This has happened with no pattern of circumstance; for example: the battery will be dead after driving for 15 miles, parking for 10 minutes while shopping, and returning to a dead battery; or after the car has been parked all day, only to have a dead battery; or a dead battery after being parked at my house overnight (in every sort of weather condition); it is completely random...and, be assured, I do not leave ANY ELECTRICAL items (radio, temperature controls, interior or exterior lights, etc.), turned on when I park my car. Therefore, I do not feel safe driving and parking my car ANYWHERE that I am remote, isolated, or unable to get a jump. I carry jumper cables in my car at all times because I never know when I may need them. Sometimes, it takes a long time to charge the battery enough to even start my car. Sometimes the battery is so dead, that the key fob doesn't even work and I have to manually open my doors...other times it's a quick jump. I have to always park my car in a position that I'm able to access the battery for a jump, if need be. I regularly went through (high-end) batteries well before their expiration date and took my SUV into the KIA dealership for diagnostics regularly - and the only answer they had is that the cause must be a \"phantom (electrical) draw,\" which they were never able to identify. I also took my SUV into other mechanics and battery specialists, but no one had any answers for me. Still, after 17 years, I have this same problem and burn through a lot of batteries. No answers. The dealership stopped assisting me, even when I was still on my extended warranty. No help from Corporate. Very disappointed in KIA in their response over all these years, beginning with my purchase of the brand new 2005 KIA Sorento.  I have always taken my SUV into the KIA dealership for the regularly scheduled service. Have others had this problem?",

I HAD TO RENT A CAR TO COME BACK TO FL AS I WAS STRANDED IN CHARLESTON WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. I CANNOT AFFORD THE $5000.00 FOR REPAIRS AND THE $1500.00 TO PAY IT OFF JUST TO GET THE TITLE TO SEND THIS TO A JUNK YARD. THE MILEAGE JUST TURNED TO 107,000 OR 108,000. THIS IS THE 4TH TIME THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE ON THIS PART OF THIS CAR HAVING TO DO WITH THE SAME ISSUES RELATED TO THIS DEFECTIVE BOLT, HARMONIC BALANCER AND PULLEY AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFECTIVE BOLT. (THIS IS ONLY ON ONE CAR). YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY TIMES THIS IS OCCURRING TO MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THESE KIA SORENTOS.

THEY AND I CONTACTED KIA, KIA HAD ME TOW IT TO THEM (WHICH IS 50 MINUTES AWAY). THEY THEN TOLD ME IT WAS NOT COVERED, AND THE PART WAS $10.97, HOWEVER THE WORK INVOLVED TO FIX IT WAS A LOT MORE EXTENSIVE AND GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $650.00-$750.00!

THEY TELL ME IT WILL COST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX IT AND I REALLY SHOULD CONTACT KIA BECAUSE THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

AFTER INSPECTION AT KIA SERVICE SHOP THE SPECIALIST IDENTIFIED THAT THE CAM SHAFT BOLT HAD SHEERED OFF DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE PART: CAM SHAFT SPROCKET-C, PART # 23120-35701 COST $60.00. THE FINAL SUGGESTION WAS TO REPLACE THE BOLT SET, SPROCKET, CRANK ANGLE SENSOR, DAMPER PULLEY, AUTO TENSIONER AND ALL DRIVE BELTS A TOTAL OF $2,000 REPAIR COST. IN 2014, THE COST REPAIR IS NOW 4,000 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE BECAUSE OF THE SAME EXACT ISSUE BUT TRAVELING OVER 40MPG CAUSING MORE DAMAGE.  THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS DEFECT DERIVES FROM THE SMALL PIN ATTACHED TO THE SPROCKET THAT TURNS THE HARMONIC BALANCER AND GRINDS THE STEEL WITH THE FORCE OF THE ENGINE INTO NOTHING. THE RESULT OF THIS DEFECT CAUSES THE HARMONIC BALANCER TO COME LOSE, SHEARING OFF THE CRANK BOLT FIRST, THEN IF TRAVELING AT LOW SPEED WILL FOLLOW WITH THE REPAIR ABOVE, HOWEVER IF AT HIGH SPEED WILL RESULT IN ENGINE DAMAGE IN THE VALVES MAKING IT NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AT A COST OF $4,000.

I WAS SO UPSET. HAD IT TOWED TO KIA. MY POWER TRAIN STILL UNDER WARRANTY,AM ORIGINAL OWNER&DENIED COVERAGE 3X.THEY TRIED TO SELL ME A USED ENGINE FOR $5K.STATED THEY KNEW THEY COULD NOT GET THE BROKEN PIECE OF BOLT OUT.I DID SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE&THERE IS MANY COMPLAINTS W/ THIS PROBLEM,SOME HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN 2,3,4 X.MGR. TOLD ME MY MODEL HAD THE NEW RE-DESIGNED BOLT,&IT WAS BRAKES PLUS FAULT WHEN THEY PUT ON THE TIMING BELT. MGR. SAID THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER USED THE OLD BOLT&THAT THEY PUT ON A NEW BOLT WHEN REPLACING TIMING BELT.I HEARD A TSB WENT OUT REGARDING THE BOLTS TO ALL SERVICE SHOPS TO USE THE NEW RE-DESIGN BOLT ON 03&04 MODELS,BUT NOT 05.IF I HAD GOTTEN A COPY OF THAT NOTICE,I WOULD HAVE MADE SURE THAT WHOEVER REPLACED TIMING BELT,USED NEW BOLT. A KIA TECH WROTE:8/10/12 ITS NOT THE BOLT, IT IS THE CRANK SPROCKET&BALANCER, THE DESIGN OF THE BALANCER STICKS OUT TO FAR&WEIGHS TO MUCH BREAKING OFF THE SPRING GUIDE PIN.WHEN THERE IS A REPAIR,WE REPLACE THEM EVERYTIME WE DO A TIMING BELT ON ONE.YOU TAKE THE CRACK SPROCKET&BALANCER&U ADD 2 MORE SPRING PINS AS WELL AS DRILL&TAP THE CRANK&INSTALL A TIMESERT (HEAVIER HELICOIL) HAVE NOT HAD ONE OF THESE COME BACK,IF ANYONE IS DOING A TIMING BELT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING THIS AT THE SAME TIME,BUT IT WILL NOT BREAK THE BOLT OR SHEER THE GUIDE PIN. *TR",

THANK GOD PEOPLE WERE NOT FLYING OR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A KIA DEALERSHIP IN NUTLEY NJ.  I DID THAT BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WAS A KIA PRODUCT LET THEIR DEALERSHIP REPAIR IT.

THE LABOR COST WAS 826.00 WITH NO GUARANTEE ON PARTS OR LABOR.  BRICK CITY PAID FOR THE PARTS AND I PAID FOR THE LABOR.  ON JULY 15TH 2012 MY KIA SORENTO HAD TO BE TOWED TO KIA IN NUTLEY NJ.  THE REP ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO GET RID OF THE VEHICLE WHILE I CAN.  I PAID 50 SOME DOLLARS FOR AN OIL CAP TO BE REPLACED.  THE VEHICLE HAD SHUT OFF AGAIN LIKE IT DID IN FEB 2012. THE REP ALSO TOLD ME THAT I NEED A TRANSMISSION.  ON JULY 26 THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START UP AND A FRIEND OF MINE TOOK ME TO HER BROTHERS MECHANIC SHOP.  THE END RESULT WAS THAT THEY FOUND THE CRANKSHAFT NEEDS REPLACING AND WAS BENT AGAIN. ON JULY 26, 2012, I, THEN WENT BACK TO KIA IN NUTLEY NJ AND THE MANAGER TOLD ME THE WORK THEY DID WAS NOT WARRANTED AND THAT BRICK CITY MOTORS SCREWED ME.

I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY FAX (NOT EMAIL) DOCUMENTATION OF SALE.  I HAD PAID CASH FOR THE BRAND NEW VEHICLE AT THE TIME.  THE KIA DEALERSHIP IN WHICH I BOUGHT THE CAR ONLY KEEPS SALES RECORDS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.

I RECENTLY BROKE DOWN BECAUSE 'THE CRANKSHAFT BOLT BROKE OFF INSIDE THE ENGINE'. IT COST ME $85.00 TO GET IT TOWED AND NOW WILL RUN AN ADDITIONAL $1,200+/- TO REPAIR IT. FROM WHAT I'M READING ON THE INTERNET WHEN THE PROBLEM IS FIXED THERE IS NO WAY OF GUARANTEEING IT WON'T HAPPEN REPEATEDLY. THROUGH NO FAULT OF SORENTO OWNERS AS TOLD BY YOUR SERVICE MECHANIC (SCOTT) OF KIA OF DUTCHESS COUNTY (NY). 'JUST A BAD PART'. APPARENTLY, THIS BOLT SHEARS OFF AND FALLS INSIDE THE ENGINE CAUSING ADDITIONAL DAMAGE. YOUR FIX SUPPOSEDLY, IS TO TORQUE THE BOLT PROPERLY, WELL THAT BOLT IS FACTORY TORQUED! I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WITH SCOTT AS HE IS COURTEOUS AND TRYING TO FIX IT. THE ISSUE IS THAT THIS VERY COSTLY FACTORY DEFECT IN EITHER THE BOLT OR THE ENGINEERING OF THE BOLT SPECIFICATIONS IS AND SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KIA MOTORS.' AS AN OWNER, I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THE FACTORY PROBLEMS AS THEY ARE NOTED THROUGH USE OF YOUR VEHICLES. ADDITIONALLY, WHEN THE BOLT BREAKS, AND I HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE, THE BRAKE AND BATTERY LIGHTS APPEAR ON THE DASHBOARD AND LOSS OF POWER STEERING OCCURS.
