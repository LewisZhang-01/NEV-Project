In the heat -- 80F - 90F degree sunny day -- response of the steering wheel became notchy, as though requiring a push to get the wheel past a notch.  After some time the symptom disappeared, until the (black color) car was again heated in hot sun of a 90F day.  It seemed incidental.  I was no longer commuting and drove the car less in 2015-2019 period, so noticed it less often.  2020 was Covid-19 so car was barely driven until Spring 2021.  Now in hot Summer 2021, the symptom is back and much stronger.  Again, only after the car has been baked in hot sunlight for some period.  Both directions (L and R) moving the wheel off centerline, requires pushing past a \"notch\" type feeling...it is NOT a smooth turn of the steering wheel.  As the car is turning, re-centering the steering wheel also is notchy with the wheel moving in jumpy increments.",

THUS THE CAR NOW HAS 7,000 MORE MILES AND AGAIN I AM TOLD IT NEEDS ANOTHER STEERING COLUMN REPLACEMENT FOR $6000. FROM INVESTIGATING OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE IT IS THE UNSEALED BEARING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLUMN THAT THE LUBRICANT DRIES AND HARDENS ONTO.

DROVE A WHILE AND STARTED TO NOTICE STEERING FELT A BIT STRANGE, BUT WROTE IT OFF THAT I \"JUST WASN'T USED TO THE CAR\" AND IT WOULD SIMPLY TAKE A WHILE TO GET USED TO IT.

SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM DESCRIBED BELOW. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENT WITH IT, BUT THIS IS A COMPLAINT THAT THERE MAY ME A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE STEERING WHEEL OF THE CAR.    1)IT KEEPS PULLING TO THE LEFT, OR TO THE RIGHT ESPECIALLY AT LOWERS SPEEDS SAY BELOW 60 MI/HR. IT REQUIRES CONSTANT ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT I COULD KEEP THE CAR ALIGNED, OR CENTERED WHILE DRIVING.    2) THE CAR PULLS ME TO THE LEFT, OR TO THE RIGHT SUDDENLY WHEN THE ROAD SURFACE IS SLIGHTINGLY UNEVEN, ESPECIALLY IN LOWER SPEEDS. I CAN NEVER PREDICT WHICH WAY THE CAR PULLS ME. IT CAN BE VERY STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE STEERING UNDER CONTROL WHEN STOPPING AT ANY RED LIGHTS BECAUSE OF THESE SUDDEN JERKS IN THE STEERING, OR PULLS IN THE STEERING WHEEL.    3) SOMETIMES, THE STEERING FEELS LIKE IT IS STUCK, OR LOCKED IN A WAY THAT I FEEL LIKE I COULD NOT CONTROL IT. THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE WEATHER IS HOT, OR AT HIGHER HUMIDITY.      4) I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I STILL HAD THE WARRANTY, AND THEN THEY REPLACED THE STEERING COLUMN AND ALIGNMENT WAS MADE AFTER THE REPLACEMENT. HOWEVER, THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT GO AWAY AT ALL. I TOOK THE CAR TO ANOTHER DEALER; I WAS TOLD THAT IT JUST REQUIRED AN ALIGNMENT WHICH WAS ALREADY DONE AFTER THE REPLACEMENT OF THE STEERING COLUMN.  SO, THERE SHOULD NOT BE AN ALIGNMENT RELATE PROBLEM. IF THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM, THE CAR SHOULD HAVE PULLED EITHER TO THE LEFT, OR TO THE RIGHT, NOT TO THE BOTH DIRECTIONS.    5) I BELIEVE IF ANY ELDERLY PERSON, OR SOMEONE WITH SLOWER REFLEX, TRIES TO DRIVE THIS CAR WITH SUCH PROBLEMS MAY END UP HAVING A CATASTROPHIC CRASH. MAINLY BECAUSE, THE DRIVER MUST PAY LOTS OF ATTENTION TO KEEP THE CAR CENTERED, OR THE STEERING UNDER CONTROL. OTHERWISE, AT ANY SECOND YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF SOMEWHERE OFF THE ROAD. *TR",

        "summary": "ON AUGUST 7, 2007 I TOOK MY CAR TO STERLING BMW IN NEWPORT BEACH, CA BECAUSE I NOTICED THE AIRBAG MALFUNCTION LIGHTS WERE ON ALONG WITH OTHER ELECTRICAL ISSUES. AFTER THEY HAD INSPECTED MY VEHICLE FOR THREE DAYS I WAS INFORMED THAT THE AIRBAG/ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE BMW FACTORY WARRANTY, AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED THAT I FILE A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE CARRIER. OBVIOUSLY MY INSURANCE COMPANY DENIED THE CLAIM, BECAUSE AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER LOSS DUE TO WEAR AND TEAR, MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL BREAKDOWN/FAILURE. IN ADDITION, STERLING BMW CHARGED ME $260.00 FOR THE LOANER CAR THEY PROVIDED FOR THE THREE DAYS WHILE MY CAR WAS BEING INSPECTED. STERLING BMW GAVE ME A VERBAL ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY $10,000.00 IN ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDED TO REPAIR ALL THE ELECTRICAL/AIRBAG ISSUES. WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO IRVINE BMW FOR ANOTHER ESTIMATE, THEY ADVISED ME THAT THEY COULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER AFTER THREE DAYS I WAS AGAIN INFORMED THAT THEY THE AIRBAG/ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO AND PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE ON FROM EXCALIBUR IMPORTS IN STUDIO CITY, CA ON MARCH 28, 2006. ALTHOUGH MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WAS A MERCEDES BENZ, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE A BMW AND BENEFIT FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY CUSTOMER SERVICE OF BMW. THIS IS, IN FACT, MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH BMW. I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN EXCELLENT CARE OF MY CAR; IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGED, AND MAINTAINED BY BMW DEALERS. I HAVE ALWAYS USE PREMIUM GAS TO ENSURE QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE. TO MY REGRET, I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR FOR OVER A YEAR WITHOUT AIRBAG PROTECTION. THE NATURE OF MY JOB REQUIRES ME TO COMMUTE OVER 100 MILES PER DAY ON THE FREEWAY. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT MY FAMILY AND I ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT THE RISKS THAT I AM TAKING BECAUSE OF BMW'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN MY VEHICLE. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE AND FIND I AM NOW AFRAID OF DRIVING BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ACID.  *TR",
