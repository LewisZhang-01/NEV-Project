I HAVE ASKED AROUND AND HEARD THAT ON MOST FORD TRUCKS AND ECONOLINE VANS ARE BLOWING THESE OUT ON THE REGULAR. I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT IT IS DUE TO THE ALUMINUM HEADS HAVING ONLY 4 WEAK THREADS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE TO ME AND CAN COST ANYWHERE FROM 200 TO 1700 DOLLARS TO FIX DEPENDING ON HOW SEVERE THINGS ARE. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE SOME RESEARCH INTO THIS SUBJECT AS I AM SURE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WOULD. *AK",
