I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE PONTIAC 800 NUMBER AGAIN AND AFTER GETTING THE SAME \"BE PATIENT\" RESPONSE, I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR - THIS TIME I WAS INFORMED MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER POWERTRAIN WARRANTY AND SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE CLOSEST PONTIAC DEALERSHIP. MY COMPLAINT IS, 1) WHY DID THE FIRST PONTIAC REP. GIVE ME THE STALL AND DELAY ANSWER BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND I RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER TODAY 12-4-10 UNTIL I SPOKE WITH A SUPERVISOR? 2) WHY AREN'T THE PARTS AVAILABLE FOR AN IMMEDIATE FIX IF THE COMPANY KNOWS IT'S A DEFECTIVE PART?
