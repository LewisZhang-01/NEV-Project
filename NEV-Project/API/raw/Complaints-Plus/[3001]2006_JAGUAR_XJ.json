THE CONTACT EXPLAINED THAT EARLY IN DECEMBER 2006 WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE BETWEEN 40 TO 45 MPH  AND BEFORE COMING TO A STOP SIGN THE VEHICLE FAILED TO RESPOND WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED. THE VEHICLE CONTINUED AT THE SAME SPEED.  THIS CAUSED THE CONTACT TO MOVE ON TO THE EMERGENCY LANE TO AVOID HITTING ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THE CONTACT CONTINUED TO APPLY THE BRAKE PEDAL WHILE ON THE EMERGENCY LANE UNTIL THE VEHICLE STOPPED.  THE CONTACT EXPLAINED THAT MID DECEMBER 2006, WHILE DRIVING AT 30 MPH ON A COUNTRY ROAD, THE  BRAKES DID NOT RESPOND WHEN APPLIED.  EVEN AFTER THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED THE VEHICLE  WENT AT THE SAME SPEED AND THE CRUISE CONTROL STAYED ON.  AFTER PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL A FEW TIMES THE VEHICLE WAS ABLE TO STOP.  AT NO TIME WAS THE CRUISE CONTROL EVER ACTIVATED.    THE THIRD TIME A SIMILAR PROBLEM  OCCURRED WAS ON 1/20/07.  THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THOMAS CADILLAC AND JAGUAR OF HARDFORD ON 1/24/07,WHERE AN IDS WAS INSTALLED, AND THE PEDAL SWITCH WAS ADJUSTED AND CHECKED.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL BECAME ACTIVE ON ALL THREE OCCASIONS AND PUMPING THE BRAKE PEDAL DID NOT DISENGAGE THE CRUISE CONTROL TO ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO SLOW DOWN OR PROPERLY STOP.
