THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF THE PLASTIC COVER IS UNKNOWN TO ME, BUT ITS ACTUAL FUNCTION IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT TRAPS MOISTURE AND ROAD SALT TO CAUSE RAPID CORROSION OF THE STAINLESS STEEL BRAKE LINES, WHICH CORROSION EVENTUALLY CAUSES THE LINES TO RUST COMPLETELY THROUGH, CAUSING ONE OR BOTH LINES TO BURST UPON APPLICATION OF THE BRAKES, RESULTING IN SUDDEN AND COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. SECOND, THE PLASTIC COVER HIDES THAT CORROSION FROM VIEW SO THAT CAREFUL VISUAL INSPECTION DOES NOT REVEAL THE CORROSION PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE KNOWLEDGEABLE MECHANIC WHO REPAIRED MY BRAKES AND WHO HAS EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROBLEM, THE DESIGN DEFECT APPLIES TO BOTH FORD TAURUS AND FORD FOCUS MODELS. THAT MECHANIC HAS IN THE PAST URGED FORD TO RECALL THESE CARS BUT FORD HAS TO DATE REFUSED TO DO SO. PRESUMABLY THE DESIGN DEFECT OCCURS ALSO IN THE  MERCURY SABLE WHICH IS MERCURY'S TWIN TO THE FORD TAURUS. THIS DESIGN DEFECT CAUSE MY BRAKES TO FAIL SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY, CAUSING ME TO HIT ANOTHER CAR. FORTUNATELY THE DAMAGE RESULTED IN NO PERSONAL INJURIES, BUT IT CAUSE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND PRESUMABLY COMPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE OTHER CAR. BUT IF THE BRAKE FAILURE HAD OCCURRED AS I WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT, OR IF I HAD BEEN BRAKING FOR A PEDESTRIAN, IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH.  I AM ATTACHING THREE PHOTO FILES, ONE TAKEN AT THE REPAIR SHOP WHERE I HAD THE BRAKE REPAIR DONE, THE SECOND A MARKED-UP COPY OF THE SAME PHOTO, THE THIRD A ZOOMED-IN PORTION OF THE FIRST PHOTO SHOWING THE SITE OF THE BRAKE LINE RUPTURE.",

WE TRIED TO BRAKE THE CAR, BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE AGAINST THE RAPID ACCELERATION. WE ENDED UP PUTTING IT IN NEUTRAL, AND THEN IN PARK, AND BRING IT TO A STOP (ALBEIT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY STREET) WHERE IT WAS STILL REACHING UPWARDS OF 4,500 RPMS. VERY DISCONCERTING. AS WE COULD NOT DRIVE ANY FURTHER LIKE THIS, WE SHUT IT OFF, GOT OUT, AND CALLED AAA FOR A TOW, WHICH ARRIVED ALMOST TWO HOURS LATER AFTER WE SAT IN THE HOT AFTERNOON SUN AND WERE DIVERTING TRAFFIC AROUND OUR DISABLED VEHICLE.    BEING THAT WE WERE TRAVELING WITH TWO OTHER GUESTS AND THE TOW TRUCK COULD ONLY ACCOMMODATE 2 PEOPLE MAX FOR THE TRIP BACK TO RHODE ISLAND (OVER 40 MILES AWAY), THE DRIVER TRIED TO DIAGNOSE AND FIX THE PROBLEM ON THE SPOT. HE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND SHOWED US THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAD BECOME UNCLIPPED AND FALLEN OFF. HE THEN LUBED IT UP, REATTACHED IT, AND HAD US DO A COUPLE OF TESTS TO SEE IF IT WAS WORKING PROPERLY. THANKFULLY IT WAS, AND WE SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY WERE ABLE TO DRIVE HOME.    AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, WE BECAME AWARE THAT THIS WAS AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH OUR YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL OF CAR, AND THAT AN INVESTIGATION HAD BEEN OPENED INTO IT. WE ARE ALSO AWARE THAT, AT THAT TIME, FORD HAD LAUNCHED A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CAMPAIGN\" TO FIX OR REPLACE DEFECTIVE CRUISE CONTROL CABLES.    WHILE WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME THAT DAY, WE ARE NOT THRILLED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS ISSUE HAPPENING AGAIN AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS ISSUE FIXED BY FORD. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THREE SEPARATE PEOPLE AT FORD AT THIS POINT, AND ALL HAVE REFUSED TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM TAKEN CARE OF BY FORD FOR US.",

BUT TODAY, AFTER ANOTHER INCIDENT OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION AS I WAS GOING ABOUT 27 MPH, EVEN WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE THE CAR REVVED ON IT'S OWN AND IT BEGAN ACCELERATING. I PUT IT IN PARK FAST AND TURNED OFF THE CAR; BUT, EVERY TIME I TURNED IT ON, THE CAR STILL WOULDN'T STOP ACCELERATING. I HAD TO TOW THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND IT'S STILL BOGGLING US WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH THE CAR, WE MIGHT END UP REPLACING THE WHOLE COMPUTER SYSTEM. THIS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES ALREADY. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC MANY TIMES FOR THIS INCIDENT AND THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY COULD BUT THE PROBLEM NEVER SEEMS TO GET FIXED.   *TR",

I HAD TO DRIVE THROUGH 3 TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO GET TO THE CLOSEST PARKING LOT TO STOP AND EACH TIME I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE CAR TO STOP AND IT WOULD \"JACK RABBIT\" START AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO HIT THE ACCELERATOR BETWEEN LIGHTS (CAR WOULD GO 35 MPH OR SO). I PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK, WHEN I DID, THE ENGINE REVVED OPEN AND WENT UP THE 3500-4000 RPM BEFORE I COULD SHUT IT OFF. I WAITED FOR MY BROTHER TO COME CHECK THE CAR. HE HOOKED UP THE CAR TO A COMPUTER TO CHECK FOR ANY ISSUES AND THERE WEREN'T ANY THAT CAME UP ON THE COMPUTER. HE HAD ME START THE CAR AND IT WAS RUNNING IN THE NORMAL RPM RANGE. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES SINCE AND HAVEN'T HAD THE CAR CHECKED OUT SINCE IT WAS BEHAVING NORMALLY. I READ ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION ON THE VEHICLE FROM 2012 AND NOTICED THAT THE REPORTS I READ WERE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I HADN'T TRIED TO USE CRUISE CONTROL AGAIN UNTIL TODAY AND DISCOVERED THAT MY CRUISE CONTROL ISN'T WORKING. THE \"CRUISE\" LIGHT COMES ON, BUT WHEN I TRY TO SET THE CRUISE CONTROL, IT WON'T SET AT ALL. I TRIED TURNING IT OFF AND ON 3 TIMES TO GET IT TO SET AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

I NOTICE THEM AT LOWER SPEEDS, BUT I CANNOT RULE OUT THE SAME ISSUE AT HIGHER SPEEDS BECAUSE BRAKING IS HARDER AT THESE SPEEDS. THE LAST INCIDENT WAS DECEMBER 31, 2012 AT 9:32 PM. THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING AT 25 MPH. I NOTICED IT WAS HARD TO STOP AND THE RPM'S WERE NOT SLOWING DOWN WHEN I BROKE. I THEN HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK. AT THAT MOMENT THE RPMS INCREASED TO 4,000 AND I TURNED THE CAR OFF. I STARTED THE CAR AGAIN IN PARK AND IT DID THE SAME THING. THE THIRD RESTART, IT BEGAN TO INCREASE, BUT WHEN I PUMPED THE PEDAL THE INCREASE STOPPED AND IT RETURNED TO NORMAL IDLE RPM.

IN ORDER TO STOP THIS RAPID ACCELERATION IN RPM, I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. UPON RESTARTING, THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY REVVED TO OVER 3000 RPM. IF I SHIFTED THE VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL, THE ENGINE WOULD REV TO 4000 RPM THEN DROP DOWN TO 1000 RPM. THIS SUDDEN, RAPID, ACCELERATION CONTINUED TO RANDOMLY OCCUR AS I DROVE TO MY DESTINATION. I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALER FOR REPAIRS, AS I WAS NOT NEAR MY PLACE OF RESIDENCE. THEY REPLACED THE IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE. HOWEVER, AS I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON AUGUST 12,2012, AT A SPEED BETWEEN 35-40 MPH, MY TAURUS BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AGAIN ON ITS OWN. I IMMEDIATELY SHIFTED THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THE RPM WENT TO 4000 AND DROPPED DOWN TO 1000. I THEN SHIFTED THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DRIVE POSITION, AND THE ENGINE IDLED FINE THE REST OF MY TRIP HOME.   THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE RAPID ACCELERATION IS SIMILAR TO WHEN USING THE CRUISE CONTROL. IF THE CRUISE CONTROL IS TURNED ON AND YOU DECIDE TO \"COAST\", THE ENGINE SLOWS DOWN. BUT WHEN YOU PRESS THE \"RESUME\" BUTTON ON THE CRUISE CONTROL, YOU CAN FEEL THE ENGINE PULL AND THE CAR BEGIN ACCELERATING. THIS IS WHAT IT FELT LIKE WHILE DRIVING. HOWEVER, I HAD NOT BEEN USING THE CRUISE CONTROL IN EITHER OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SITUATIONS.

IT CAUSED A LOUD SOUND THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION AND STARTLED EVERYONE IN THE PARKING LOT.  STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO, I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF.  A PARKING SPOT OPENED UP SO I TURNED ON THE IGNITION, THAT CAUSED AN EVEN LOUDER EXPLOSIVE SOUND.  I WAS STILL TERRIFIED BUT I HAD TO ACT - SO I FORCED THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN AS HARD AS I COULD AND SHIFTED TO D AND WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE INTO THE PARKING SPOT.  I PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AGAIN AND AGAIN IT CAUSED A LOUD EXPLOSIVE SOUND.  BY NOW I WAS A SPECTACLE IN THE PARKING LOT BUT I WAS JUST THANKFUL THAT I WAS ALIVE AND THAT NO ONE WAS HURT.

THIS CAN RESULT IN PROLONGED STOPPING TIMES AND DISTANCES, ACCIDENTS, UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION, AND HEATING UP BRAKES TO THE POINT OF A FIRE.

IT NOW HAS A LITTLE OVER 82,00 ON IT. BUT STILL REGARDLESS OF THE MILES OR YEARS THERE IS NO WAY THAT 4 SETS OF TIRES SHOULD;VE HAD TO BE PUT  ON MY CAR. JUST ABOUT EVERYTIME I GET THE ALIGNMENT CHECKED IT COST ME $ 40 AND THEN MORE IF ADJUSTMENTS ARE TO BE MADE. I DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY.  THE CAR FAX SHOWS NOTHING. *TR",

THE HEAD REST FORCES THE HEAD DOWNWARD INTO THE CHIN, AND MOST IRRITATINGLY CREATES A CONTINUING DISTRACTION TO THE DRIVER WHO FEELS AS IF SOMEONE IS CONSTANTLY PLAYING WITH THEIR HAIR.       WE WERE ADVISED THAT THERE IS \"NOTHING\" THAT THE DEALERSHIP CAN DO TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AS IT IS A DESIGN ISSUE GIVEN THE DEALERSHIP BY FORD MOTOR CO.  HOWEVER, LOOKING AT OTHER FOCUS MODELS, CONFIRMS THAT OF THE TWO HEAD REST IN EVERY VEHICLE, ONE IS PREDOMINATELY \"PUSHED FORWARD\" OF THE OTHERS, AND THAT THE FORWARD ANGLES IN ALL EXAMINED HEAD REST IS DIFFERENT.   WE HAVE TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT REPAIRABLE, BUT CAN BE MODIFIED.  FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR DEALERSHIP CONSUMER AFFAIRS MANAGER HAVE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM SEEN NOT JUST IN THE FOCUS, BUT IN OTHER FORD MODELS AS WELL.  IT APPEARS THAT THE USUAL FIX IS TO SIMPLY SWAP HEAD REST -   I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IN SOME CASES THE HEAD REST ARE SIMPLY TURNED AROUND THE OTHER DIRECTION TO RESOLVE THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT - OR REMOVED ALTOGETHER.    ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT AS A RESULT OF THIS CONCERN, MY WIFE HAS REPORTED ONE \"INCIDENT\" IN WHICH SHE ALMOST BACKED INTO A VEHICLE BECAUSE SHE KNEE-JERK REACTED TO REACH BACK TO MOVE AWAY \"SOMETHING CRAWLING ON MY HEAD.\"    I AM CONCERNED THAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT THAT CAN BE RANDOMLY WORSE ON SOME VEHICLES MORE THAN OTHERS, CREATES A DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING THAT MAY PRECIPITATE AN ACCIDENT.  FURTHER, DEALERSHIP SOLUTIONS MAY EXPOSE CONSUMERS TO SOLUTIONS THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF THE HEAD REST AS A SAFETY DEVICE    ARE YOU AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND IS ANY EFFORT BEING MADE TO RECALL THE DEFECTIVE HEAD REST AND REPLACE THEM WITH ERGONOMIC REPLACEMENTS?
