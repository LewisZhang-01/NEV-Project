        "summary": "I LEASED THE 2017 MERCEDES BENZ GLE 350 IN DECEMBER 2016. WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF HAVING THE CAR, IT STARTED MAKING THIS SQUEALING NOISE WHEN DRIVING. THE NOISE COME AND GOES.     WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR FOR MAINTENANCE IN NOVEMBER 2017, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT PRESENT WHILE SERVICING THE CAR THEREFORE THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.     FAST FORWARD ANOTHER 8 MONTHS AND I GOT A WARNING LIGHT IN MY CAR SAYING THAT I NEEDED TO CHANGE MY BRAKE PADS. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS CAR ONLY HAD 15,000 MILES AT THIS POINT. WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN FOR SERVICE, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE THE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS DUE TO EXCESSIVE WEAR DOWN. WHEN I ASKED THEM IF THIS WAS THE USUAL, THE SERVICE REP INFORMED THAT THEY USUALLY DONT CHANGE BREAKS UNTIL ABOUT 30,000 OR SO BUT THESE BREAKS HAVE BEEN WEARING DOWN UNEVENLY THEREFORE THEY NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. WHEN I ASKED HIM IF THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SQUEALING NOISE WAS, HE SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NOISE WAS UNTIL THEY CHANGED THE BREAKS AND ROTORS. HE ASSUMED THAT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THERE BUT IF THIS WAS SO, THEN THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THIS CAR WAS DEFECTIVE SINCE RIGHT AFTER A GOT IT. THE REP. PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT MY DRIVING MAY HAVE CAUSED THE UNEVEN WEAR AND TEAR OF MY BREAKS. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE 2 LITTLE KIDS THEREFORE MY DRIVING IS NOT WRECKLESSLY OR CONDUSIVE OF WEARING DOWN BREAKS WITHIN A YEAR.     I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND SOME FORUMS ONLINE OF MB LEASERS COMPLAINING OF THESE SAME TWO ISSUES; BREAKS AND WEIRD NOISES COMING FROM NEW CARS. SOME MENTIONED THE TYPE OF BREAKS USED ON THESE CARS ARE DEFECTIVE AND THAT IT IS A MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THEM.     PLEASE HELP ME RESEARCH THIS ISSUE AND SEE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THE CARMAKER NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR.     THANK YOU.",
