THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE NOW, THANKFULLY THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED IT WHILE IN THE GARAGE AND THUS THERE WAS NO RISK WHILE DRIVING. HOWEVER THE SECOND TIME, WHICH OCCURRED LAST NIGHT,  WAS WHILE I WAS ON A WINDY MOUNTAIN ROAD. I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW TO WRITE NHTSA THIS LETTER. RIGHT BEFORE THE CAR COMPLETELY LOST OIL PRESSURE, DUE TO THE FILTER FALLING OFF, I NOTICED THAT THE HANDLING WAS OFF, ALMOST AS IF THE CAR HAD A LOW/FLAT TIRE. THANKFULLY I WAS GOING WELL UNDER THE RATED SPEED LIMIT AFTER I NOTICED THIS OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AND LIKELY WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES ONLINE WHERE OTHER OWNERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE FILTERS FALLING OFF DUE TO VIBRATION ISSUES.
