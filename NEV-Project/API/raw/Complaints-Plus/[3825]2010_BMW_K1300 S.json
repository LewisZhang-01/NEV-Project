INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE REVEALED SIGNIFICANT PLAY (APPROXIMATELY 5 MM MEASURED AT THE WHEEL RIM) IN THE REAR WHEEL, INDICATIVE OF SOME TYPE OF BEARING FAILURE IN THE FINAL DRIVE ASSEMBLY. BMW DEALER MECHANIC VERIFIED THAT THE PLAY WAS EXCESSIVE. MECHANIC PROCEEDED TO TEAR DOWN THE FINAL DRIVE ASSEMBLY, AND NOTED BEARING SEIZURE AND WEAR OF THE AXLE AGAINST THE BEARING INNER RACE. ENTIRE FINAL DRIVE ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED.   I BELIEVE THERE IS NO WAY THIS TYPE OF FAILURE SHOULD OCCUR IN A PROPERLY DESIGNED ASSEMBLY, WITH A LARGE BALL BEARING IN AN OIL BATH, AT THE LOW VEHICLE MILES. ALL MANUFACTURER REQUIRED MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED AT THE PROPER INTERVALS. THIS FAILURE COULD EASILY HAVE RESULTED IN A REAR WHEEL LOCKUP, WHICH COULD THEN RESULT IN A HIGH SPEED CRASH.  *TR",
