There were no symptoms of the problem before the failure.  - - - - I used the automotive charger to charge a battery after a light had been on overnight, discharging the battery. I removed the battery from the vehicle because the terminals might have been corroded. When I first put the charger on the battery it indicated full and did not start to recharge it, so I used jumper cables to charge the discharged battery from a good battery in my car and left the charger at 10 amps on the good battery at the same time so that battery would not become discharged. I left it to sit, figuring it would take several hours at that setting, and after about 5 minutes I saw smoke. Both 12v wires were hot and insulation burned or melted off. There is damage to the car where the wires rested on the painted plastic bumper and a plastic bit near the battery, and of course the charger is useless. I wrote to the manufacturer on March 28 to make them aware, and ask how to avoid it in the future, and ask if it can be repaired. I have not heard back. - - - - The user manual for this product is at http://manuals.harborfreight.com/manuals/60000-60999/60653.pdf The current year model of this product is at https://www.harborfreight.com/10250a-12v-manual-charger-with-engine-start-60581.html - - - - The charger is sold by Harbor Freight Tools under the Cen-Tech brand.",

I COULD NOT CONTROL THE CAR, AND MY CAR RUN THROUGH THE TRAFFIC LIGHT, AND EVERYONE IN THE CAR WAS VERY VERY SCARED.

ACCORDING TO THEM A BOX SPRING PUTS TO MUCH STRESS ON THE RACK AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOADED ON THE VEHICLE. THE OWNERS MANUAL DOES NOT MAKE ANY MENTION OF THIS AND THERE ARE NO SAFETY LABELS ON THE RACK ITSELF. THIS LOAD ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL WAS ACCEPTABLE. IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT THERE WERE NO VEHICLES BEHIND ME AT THE TIME. THE BOX SPRING COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IF IT HAD HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. WHEN I FIRST CALLED THE DEALER AFTER THE PROBLEM I ASKED ONLY WHETHER THE ROOF RACK SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE HAVING A FULL SIZE BOX SPRING ON IT. THE PERSON I ASKED TOLD ME IT WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD. I THEM LET THEM HIM KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. NOW THEY ARE SAYING IT WASN'T DESIGNED FOR THIS. BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE AND STRESS CREATED BY THIS ITEM. IT VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN A CANOE, KAYAK, BICYCLE OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS AND ALSO AT SPEEDS MUCH GREATER THAN THE 45 MPH THAT I WAS TRAVELING. *JB",

THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN ACCELERATING WITH THE AIR ON OR OFF. MY DASHBOARD AIR SWITCH IS ALWAYS SET TO RE-CIRCULATE INTERIOR AIR (NOT TO BRING FRESH AIR FROM THE OUTSIDE IN). THE SMELL GETS SO BAD THAT I MUST OPEN THE WINDOWS TO AIR OUT THE STINK.  IT HAPPENS NO MATTER WHAT OCTANE OF GAS I USE. IT MAY HAPPEN OR NOT HAPPEN AT ANY GIVEN TIME. I FREQUENT GAS STATIONS NEAR ME THAT ARE NO OLDER THAN TWO YEAR OLD.    WHEN I BROUGHT IN THE VAN TO A FACTORY TOYOTA SERVICE DEALER AND AFTER THEY CHECKED IT OUT, THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NORMAL WITH ALL TOYOTAS ESPECIALLY SIENNAS & SEQUOIAS. THEY HANDED ME A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) ENTITLED \" SULFUR ODOR FROM EXHAUST\" ALL MODELS, DOCUMENT NUMBER EG003-03. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND TSB THIS ON YOUR SITE OR ANY OTHER INTERNET SITE.      THIS MAY BE NORMAL TO SMELL AT THE END OF THE EXHAUST TAILPIPE, BUT SHOULD THE SMELL OF SULFUR BE GETTING INTO THE PASSENGER CABIN AREA WITH THE DOORS & WINDOWS CLOSED AND THE AIR ON RE-CIRCULATE? SHOULD IT BE SO STRONG THAT IT FORCES THE OCCUPANTS TO OPEN THE WINDOWS TO GET FRESH AIR IN THE CAR? WHY IS SULFUR ODOR THAT IS A COMPONENT OF GAS EXHAUST ENTERING THE CAR? HOW SAFE IS THIS FOR US, KIDS, AND INFANTS? SHOULD NOT MY VENTS AND WINDOWS BEING CLOSED, PREVENT THIS SMELL FROM ENTERING THE PASSENGER AREA?
