SO, I THEN HAD TO TRY A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THIS LED TO SEVERAL CALLS WHERE NO ONE REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I FINALLY GOT MY ORIGINAL SERVICE MANAGER TO RESEARCH THE SITUATION, AND HE SAID THE PARTS WERE STILL ON BACK ORDER.

AFTER A VISIT TO THE STONE MOUNTAIN, GA DEALERSHIP, THEY WANTED $4000 FOR PARTS AND LABOR ON AN EMISSION COMPONENT FAILURE (AIR PUMP INJECTION SYSTEM).

MY INTERNET RESEARCH REVEALED TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THE DEFECTIVE SECONDARY AIR INJECTION SYSTEM IN THEIR VEHICLES AND AS A RESULT ISSUED A WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT, IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF AIR INDUCTION PUMP ASSEMBLIES AND/OR AIR INJECTION SWITCHING VALVES ISSUES ON THEIR 2007-2010 TUNDRA AND 2008-2010 SEQUOIA MODELS, UP TO 150,000 MILES.    I CALLED TOYOTA TO QUESTION WHY THE DECISION WAS MADE TO NOT INCLUDE ALL MODEL YEARS WITH THE DEFECTIVE SECONDARY AIR INJECTION SYSTEM AND WAS INFORMED IT WAS THEIR ENGINEERS' DECISION.  NO ONE AT TOYOTA COULD FURTHER EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.  MY RESEARCH REVEALS THERE ARE MANY MODELS FOR 2005 - 2008 AFFECTED BY THIS DEFECT.    THE EXPLANATION FOR THE EXORBITANT EXPENSE WAS BECAUSE OF A DESIGN CHANGE AND THAT TOYOTA NO LONGER MANUFACTURES THE DEFECTIVE PART, OWNERS OF VEHICLES FOR MODELS 2005 - 2008 WOULD NEED TO REPLACE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  SO, TOYOTA APPARENTLY ACKNOWLEDGES A DEFECT IN THEIR DESIGN AND ITS IMPACT ON VEHICLE OWNERS.    I CANNOT AFFORD $5,000.00 FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY EIGHT (8) YEARS OLD.

THEN DURING A PAST WINTER STORM, BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY AGAIN, THE SAME THING OCCURRED. VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS BRAKING SYSTEM IS DEFECTED IN ANY WET/SNOWY/ICE WEATHER. I HAVE HAD TO DIVERT TO DRIVING MY 1998 HONDA ACCORD IN SNOW INSTEAD OF THE SEQUOIA. I AM VERY CONCERNED DRIVING THIS SEQUOIA WITH MY KIDS IN CAR AND BRAKING AT ANYTIME. I FEEL AN UPDATED SOFTWARE/LOGIC IN ECU OR AN UPDATED SKID CONTROL ECU IS VALID ENOUGH TO SAY THEY HAVE A KNOWN ISSUE THAT IS 'SAFETY' RELATED, AND TOYOTA SHOULD BUCK UP COVERING THIS AS WARRANTY. I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA MOTOR SALES, USA, INC. AND MY CASE IS FILED AT THEIR HEADQUARTER OFFICE UNDER MY NAME AND FILE #[XXX]. THEY STATED THEIR IS NO CUSTOMER COMPLIANCE ISSUED RECALL/BULLETIN OR WARRANTY AVAILABLE TO COVER MY CONCERN DUE TO ITS AGE AND MILEAGE.

I WAS HESITANT, BUT DID LEAVE TO GO OUT OF TOWN....ONLY TO FIND MYSELF AT YET ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WITH THE SAME BRAKE LIGHTS COMING ON.....AND THEN GOING OFF WHEN THEY WENT IN TO THE SERVICE STALL.

THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO LURCH A BIT BUT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER THIS WAS FROM THE PRESSURE CHANGES WHEN THE SUNROOF EXPLODED OR WHETHER THE DRIVER MAY HAVE TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE EXPLOSION.      WE EXITED THE HIGHWAY TO INSPECT THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THAT THE SUNROOF WAS BROKEN IN A SYMMETRICAL FASHION WITH THE CENTRAL PORTION OF IT BLOWN OUT.  THERE WAS IN RETROSPECT ONLY A SMALL  AMOUNT OF GLASS IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SLIDING ROOF PANEL AND THE BROKEN SUNROOF WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE GLASS WAS CARRIED AWAY IN THE AIR.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYTHING HAD FALLEN ON THE VEHICLE.  WE WERE NOT GOING UNDER AN OVERPASS AND NOT CLOSE TO ANY VEHICLES AHEAD OF US.  ON REVIEWING THE INTERNET INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM IT DOES SEEM THAT IT IS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND PROBABLY THEIR ARE MANY CASES THAT GO UNREPORTED.

I TOOK MY SEQUOIA INTO THE CLOSEST DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A SKID CONTROL ECU #89541-0C070 ($2206), MASTER CYLINDER PRESSURE SENSOR #89637-0C020 ($477.86) AND A KNOCK SENSOR BANK 2 #89615-06010 #17171-50030 ($741).  MY RESEARCH HAS SHOWED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY VEHICLE OWNER WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS CONFIRMED WITH ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE; HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE SENSORS ARE MALFUNCTIONING, MY ABS AND TRAC IS NOT WORKING.  I HAVE CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE.  THEY WERE ONLY WILLING TO HELP ME OUT WITH APPROX 20% OF THE COST.  I MADE MY FIRST CALL YESTERDAY.  I CALLED AGAIN TO DAY AND WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD HEAR BACK FROM A MANAGER BY 6PM PST TOMORROW.  AN INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE STARTED ON THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

WE PURCHASED TOYOTA'S SERVICE PLAN & TOOK IT IN AS SUGGESTED EVERY 5,000 MILES. MY WIFE TOLD A SERVICE MAN & WAS TOLD IT WAS EXPECTED. I TOOK IT IN & THEY ROTATED THE TIRES AGAIN. GOING AGAINST TOYOTA'S RECOMMENDATION(EVERY OTHER OIL CHANGE). I DIDN'T SEE HOW ROTATING THEM SOONER WOULD STOP THE PROBLEM. I HAVE NOTICED THE TRACTION ON THEM FAILING EVEN ON DRY ROAD AND THIS IS THE ONLY FORM OF TRANSPORTATION FOR MY WIFE AND 2 YEAR OLD SON. LOOKING ONLINE I HAVE FOUND TOYOTA HAD COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM SINCE 2003. THERE'S EVEN SEVERAL ONES FOR THE SAME EXACT CAR AS OURS. OTHERS HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS & I AM WANTING TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE AND WE WANT THEM REPLACED THE OUTSIDE EDGE ON ALL 4 OF OURS HAVE BEEN BALD OVER 10,000 MILES. YET TOYOTA SAYS ITS OK. ARE THEY TRYING TO PUSH US OFF UNTIL THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED? OH, DUNLOP'S WEB SITE SAID TO GO TO THE DEALER,TOYOTA'S HANDBOOK SAID TO GO TO THE TIRE CO.? I DON'T CARE WHO SAID WHAT I BOUGHT THE SEQUOIA NEW FROM TOYOTA WITH THE TIRES THEY PUT ON IT & THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER 3 YEARS NOW. SOMEONE NEEDS TO STEP UP AND TAKE CARE OF THIS BEFORE THERE'S AN ACCIDENT & SOMEONE REALLY GETS HURT. I'M GOING TO TAKE IT IN FOR THE 30,000 ON 1/3/07 & ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AGAIN. HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED EVERY REVIEW STATES THAT THE NEW TIRES(SAME ONES) DO THE SAME THING. ONE PERSON HAS ALREADY HAD THEM REPLACED TWICE. WE SHOULD GET SAFE TIRES THAT LAST (WITH NORMAL CARE & WEAR)AS LONG OR EVEN CLOSE TO THE TIME EXPECTED WE PAID FOR IT!. IF YOU DO SOME ON LINE SEARCHES YOU WON'T HAVE TO LOOK LONG TO SEE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THESE TIRES ARE VERY UNSAFE AND MISLEADING. PLEASE HELP!BOUGHT THIS SUV TO KEEP MY FAMILY SAFE. THANK YOU. CONCERNED HUSBAND AND FATHER. *JB",

I OBVIOUSLY LOVE THE CAR BUT THERE IS AN UNFORTUNATE FLAW IN THE 2005 MODEL THAT DIFFERS FROM MY 2001 MODEL.  WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED COLD THE IDLE SPEED IS VERY HIGH - ABOUT 1500+ RPM.  THE IDLE DOESN'T SLOW DOWN APPRECIABLY UNTIL THE CAR HAS WARMED UP - ABOUT 5 MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE HIGH IDLE COMES WHEN TRYING TO DRIVE THE CAR ON AN ICY SURFACE.  I CAME OUT OF MY GARAGE ON AN ICY MORNING, PUT THE CAR INTO FORWARD, KEPT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND SLOWLY TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD.  EVEN AT A SNAIL'S PACE THE CAR SKIDDED UNCONTROLLABLY INTO A RAISED FLOWER BED BY MY HOUSE SCRAPING THE UNDER PANELS.  MY 2001 SEQUOIA NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.    THE HIGH IDLE SPEED MAKES THE CAR UNCONTROLLABLE ON ICE.  THERE IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH TORQUE AND POWER EVEN WITH THE BRAKE ON.  TOYOTA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SET BACK THE IDLE SPEED SO THAT THE CAR CAN BE CONTROLLED ON A SLIPPERY SURFACE WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARMING UP.  *JB",
