        "summary": "MY TOYOTA SCION FR-S 2014 SUDDENLY STOPPED AND LOST ITS POWER WHILE I WAS DRIVING ALONG A CITY STREET IN FAIRFIELD CA . THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED BY THE DEALER SINCE PURCHASE . IT ONLY HAD 33,000 MILES AND I WAS VERY SURPRISE WHAT WENT WRONG . MY SON ROLLED THE VEHICLE TO A SIDE STREET . WE CALLED OUR INSURANCE FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THE CAR WAS TOWED TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN FAIRFIELD CA.  THEY WENT ON TO DIAGNOSE AND  FOUND THE CAR TO BE OF PEARL CONDITION , WITH PERFECT OIL LEVEL AND QUALITY . THEY SAID IT WAS MOTOR MALFUNCTION . THE VALVE SPRINGS WERE OUT OF PLACE AND CREATED A STRANGE NOISE . THEY RECOMMENDED MOTOR REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD COST ME $11K FOR A USED ENGINE WITH 51K MILES . I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS VERY COMMON INCIDENT WITH TOYOTA FRS 2012 TO 2014 MODELS . THERE WAS A RECALL BUT IT WAS HALTED BECAUSE AFTER THE RECALL , MOST RECALLED  TOYOTA FRS STILL GET STALLED DUE TO THE SEALANTS USED .    WE HAVE SEVERAL (ALL TOYOTA ) CARS AND THIS CAR IN PARTICULAR IS JUST USED 40 MILES A MONTH . OUR RESTAURANT IS JUST A MILE AWAY FROM WHERE WE LIVE .  THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO WAY WE HAD NOT TAKEN CARE OF THIS CAR .  I CHECKED THE RECALLS FOR THIS MODEL AND MAKE , AND THERE IS NONE !   IT HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE DRIVING AT A SPEED OF 15 ON A CITY SIDE STREET , JUST HEADING STRAIGHT  AHEAD .",

THEN HE INFORMED ME THAT IT \"POOPED A ROD BEARING\" AND THAT I NEED A NEW MOTOR. HE MENTIONED A USED MOTOR GOES FOR $5000. I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT I NEEDED A NEW MOTOR AT 60,181 MILES. THEREFORE I HAD IT TOWED TO TOYOTA DELEARSHIP IN TUSTIN CALIFORNIA. AFTER RUNNING A DIAGNOSTIC AND DRAINING OIL FROM VEHICLE..THE MECHANIC SAID THERE WAS METAL PIECES IN THE OIL AND THAT THE MOTOR WAS DEFINITELY OIL STARVED. HE QUOTED A NEW ENGINE INSTALLATION WOULD BE $12,000. I CURRENTLY OWE $16,000 ON MY 2014 SCION FRS. I COULDN'T AFFORD IT SO I CONTACTED TOYOTA TO SEE IF IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT BEING THAT THIS DOESN'T  NORMALLY HAPPEN AT 60,000 MILES UNDER NORMAL DRVING CONDITIONS AND MAINTENANCE. TOYOTA DIDN'T HONOR MY WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS JUST OVER 181 MILES.",
