THE NOISE WAS SO JARRING MY HUSBAND JERKED THE STEERING WHEEL BUT QUICKLY GAINED CONTROL. WE WERE LUCKY THERE WEREN'T ANY CARS IN THE LEFT LANE BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AS WE QUICKLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION, WE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF GLASS CRACKING ABOVE US. THE SUN VISOR ABOVE US WAS CLOSED AS WELL AS THE SUNROOF. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE SUN VISOR, BUT WE MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SUNROOF WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LOUD BANG AND THE SOUND OF GLASS CRACKING SO WE KEPT THE VISOR CLOSED. IF THE SUNROOF COVER WAS OPEN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED IN BROKEN GLASS. WE EXITED THE HIGHWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  WE DROVE INTO THE JACKSONVILLE CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM WESTSIDE DEALERSHIP IN JACKSONVILLE FL, THAT WAS JUST OFF THE HIGHWAY AND THAT IS WHEN WE SAW THE SUNROOF HAD A LARGE HOLE IN IT AND THE GLASS WAS CONTINUING TO SHATTER AND DISINTEGRATE. IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE WAY THE GLASS WAS BROKEN ON THE SUNROOF THAT IT WAS AS IF THE GLASS WAS BLOWN OUTWARD FROM THE VEHICLE AND NOT CAUSED BY SOMETHING HITTING IT FROM OUTSIDE FROM ABOVE. ALSO THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE INTERIOR VISOR OF THE VEHICLE. WE HAD NOT GONE UNDER A OVERPASS AND THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT OF US AND NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE.  *HAVING DIFFICULTY UPLOADING IMAGES SO IF THEY AREN'T VISIBLE PLEASE CONTACT US.",
