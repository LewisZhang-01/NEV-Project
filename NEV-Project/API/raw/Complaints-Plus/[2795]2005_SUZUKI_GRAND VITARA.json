WHEN SHE RETURNED THE DOORS HAD AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED HER OUT, SHE HAD TO CALL A FRIEND TO BRING AN EXTRA KEY.  LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE OUR DAUGHTER WITH HER OR SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED INSIDE.  WE JUST FIGURED IT WAS AN AUTOMATIC ANTI-THEFT PROGRAM, BUT DIDN'T REALIZE OTHERS WERE HAVING PROBLEMS.  FROM NOW ON, WE JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE KEYS ON US, OR ROLL THE WINDOW IF THE VEHICLE IS STILL RUNNING WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF IT EVEN JUST FOR A SECOND.  *NM",
