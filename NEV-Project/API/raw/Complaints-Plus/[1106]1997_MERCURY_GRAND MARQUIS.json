SHE SAID SHE WAS DRIVING AT THE SPEED LIMIT OF 75 MPH AND WANTED TO PASS A SEMI-TRUCK ON HER RIGHT SO SHE SPEED UP TO PASS THE SEMI-TRUCK.  SHE NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN TO VIBRATE VIOLENTLY AND SHE HELD ON THE STEERING WHEEL AS HARD AS SHE CAN.  THEN SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AND IT BEGAN TO SWERVE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SEMI-TRUCK.  THE CAR STRUCK THE SIDE OF THE SEMI-TRUCK AND THE WINDOW GLASS ON THE FRONT AND THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE SHATTERED AND ALSO THE REAR WINDSHIELD SHATTERED BECAUSE THE ROOF OF THE CAR WAS BENT.  AFTER THE IMPACT, MY WIFE'S CAR THEN SWERVED TO THE LEFT AND WENT INTO A DITCH FILLED WITH WEEDS AND BUSHES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD.  LUCKILY THE CAR DID NOT FLIP AND EVERYONE IN THE CAR WAS OK BECAUSE THEY ALL WERE WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS.  THEY WERE SHAKEN UP A BIT BUT THE ORDEAL WAS TRAUMATIZING.  THEY WERE ALSO LUCKY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CAR IN FRONT OR BEHIND THEM AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE POLICE, FIRE TRUCK, AND AMBULANCE CAME AND EXAMINED EVERYTHING.  THEY NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A BUBBLE ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE FRONT TIRE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  FOR INSURANCE SAKE, THE POLICE SAID MY WIFE WAS AT FAULT BECAUSE SHE WAS SPEEDING WHILE TRYING TO PASS THE SEMI-TRUCK AND LOST CONTROL.  I BELIEVE SHE LOST CONTROL BECAUSE THE BRIDGESTONE TURANZA TIRE WAS COMING APART AND CAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL TO SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY.

FOLLOWING THE MECHANIC'S INSPECTION TEST DRIVE, HE REPORTED NONE OF THE SYMPTOMS (LOOSE STEERING, FRONT END NOISE) WHICH FORD CLAIMS WILL WARN OF A POTENTIAL IMMINENT FAILURE.

THERE WAS A RECALL AND CLASS ACTION SUIT AS MY 1997 COUGAR HAD 3 INTAKES REPLACED, ONE THE MANUFACTURER REIMBURSED UNDER RECALL. THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE OTHER TWO BUT THEY SENT ME THE SAME FAULTY PART ON THE SECOND GO ROUND. ON MY CAR AND THIS GRAND MARQUIS, MILEAGE WAS RIGHT AT 80,000 ON FIRST OCCURRENCE. MY PARENTS NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER ON THIS CAR BUT DID RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE CLASS ACTION SUIT. THE KEPT THE NOTICE OF THE SUIT IN THEIR FILE BUT DID NOT RESPOND AS THEY NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER AND THOUGHT THEIR VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED. THE MANUFACTURER STATES THEY \"CANNOT HELP\". THE RECALL WAS FOR SEVEN YEARS, UNLIMITED MILEAGE FROM FEB 2008. FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD MAKE GOOD ON THEIR FAULTY PARTS REGARDLESS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE WHEN IT HAPPENS, THE RESULTS COULD BE DEVASTATING, NOT TO MENTION THE BILL FOR ALL THE REPAIRS.

I OBJECT TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR THE ADDITIONAL DAMAGE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR WHEN THERE IS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THIS PART.   AFTER HAVING THE INTAKE MANIFOLD REPLACED WE EXPERIENCED ABNORMAL PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDED ABNORMALLY HIGH COOLANT TEMPERATURES DURING A ROAD TRIP, WHICH CAUSED US TO HAVE TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED FROM OUT OF THE AREA TO THE LOCAL MERCURY DEALER. THEY DISCOVERED NO PROBLEM WITH THE REPLACEMENT OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, BUT THE HEADS AND BLOCK HAD WARPED AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE REQUIRING A COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT.  IF THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN UNDER WARRANTY THEN THE TOTAL COST OF ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.  FOR THIS REASON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF JUST RETROACTIVELY PROVIDING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE MANIFOLD ALONE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  IF THE VEHICLE WARRANTY HAD BEEN IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE THEN ALL REPAIR COSTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.

MY UNCLE CAME BACK FROM WWII BOUGHT A NEW FORD OR MERCURY EVERY   2-3 YEARS FOR 50 YEARS, WHAT GRATITUDE.  I SEE WHY FORD AND GM IS GOING DOWN THE TUBES.  IT EXCLUDED CARS THAT WERE MORE THAN 7 YEARS OLD WHEN THEY EXPERIENCED MANIFOLD FAILURE.

I WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I LEARNED THAT THE MANIFOLD WAS MADE OF PLASTIC; IT ACTUALLY BLEW APART, RELEASING ALL  THE ENGINE COOLANT AT ONCE.  ADDITIONALLY, I LEARNED THAT NOT ONLY DID FORD ENGINEER AN INFERIOR MAJOR ENGINE COMPONENT, BUT THEY MADE MY FAMILY THE GUINEA PIG TO FIELD TEST THIS JUNK!  TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT.  MY COST INCLUDED: TOWING $125, MANIFOLD REPLACEMENT FOR $800, AND AN UNPLANNED HOTEL STAY INCLUDING MEALS FOR APPROXIMATELY $225 WITH A TOTAL COST OF $1150 WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LOSS OF A DAYS PAY.

WHEN I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, IT WENT TO THE FLOOR RESULTING IN A PUDDLE OF BRAKE FLUID UNDER THE CAR JUST BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT. FORTUNATELY THIS HAPPENED WHEN THE CAR WAS IN OUR DRIVEWAY AND NOT WHILE DRIVING TO WORK ON THE HIGHWAY. WE PURCHASED THIS CAR NEW IN NOVEMBER 1996 AND HAD ONLY 47,441 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.  AN INSPECTION OF THE REAR BRAKE LINES SHOWED THEY WERE BOTH EXTREMELY CORRODED ALONG THEIR ENTIRE LENGTH. THE MERCURY DEALER HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE BRAKE AND FUEL LINE ASSEMBLY ($1223) ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR. THE FINAL COST TO REPAIR THE LEAKING BRAKE LINE WAS $1901. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THIS RELATIVELY SMALL MERCURY DEALERSHIP ESTIMATED THEY DO THIS REPAIR ABOUT ONCE A MONTH ON MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS AND LINCOLN TOWN CARS.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM RESULTING FROM MERCURY EITHER SPECIFYING OR USING AN INADEQUATE MATERIAL FOR THIS CRITICAL SAFETY PART. WHEN I INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET I FOUND THAT NHTSA IS CONDUCTING AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF THIS BASIC PROBLEM (ACTION# EA03-012) AND CONTACTED MERCURY CUSTOMER RELATIONS PRIOR TO MAKING THE REPAIR.

I SUSPECT THAT THE 710 BRAKE LINE FAILURES LISTED IN NHTSA ACTION# EA03-012 FOR 1995-1997 GRAND MARQUIS, TOWN CAR AND CROWN VICTORIA VEHICLES IS JUST THE SURFACE OF THE PROBLEM SINCE MOST REPAIRS LIKE MINE ARE MADE OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOT REPORTED. *JB",

ANTIFREEZE SMELL WAS STRONG, WATER WAS SHOOTING INTO MY ALTERNATOR AND THE ENGINE WAS EXCESSIVELY HOT.

I THOUGHT I HAD RUPTURED A HOSE, UPON CLOSER INSPECTION; IT APPEARED TO ME THAT A HOSE HAD BLOWN CLOSE TO THE ENGINE BLOCK IN A PLACE THAT I COULD NOT SEE WELL.  A MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THE NEXT DAY THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS PLASTIC AND THAT IT HAD CRACKED.  BUT LUCKILY FOR ME HE WOULD HELP ME OUT, HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A SPARE MANIFOLD THAT HE HAD TAKEN OFF OF ANOTHER CAR LIKE MINE.  APPARENTLY, SOMEONE HAD BLOWN A HEAD GASKET IN THEIR \u001297 GRAND MARQUIS AND THE OWNERS WERE CONVINCED THAT IT WAS THE INTAKE MANIFOLD.  SO THE MECHANIC REPLACED THEIR MANIFOLD AND KEPT THEIR OLD ONE THAT WAS STILL GOOD.  THE MECHANIC WAS WILLING TO SELL ME THE MANIFOLD AND REPLACE THE BROKEN ONE ON MY CAR FOR ABOUT HALF THE PRICE IT WAS GOING TO COST ME TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP REPLACE IT.  THE DEALER WOULD HAVE BILLED ME NEARLY $600.00, SO I TOLD HIM TO PERFORM THE REPAIRS.  HE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE PLASTIC INTAKES AND HAD REDESIGNED THEM.  THE ONE HE PLACED ON MY CAR WAS SUPPOSEDLY OF THE NEW DESIGN.  LATER IN A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF JUDGMENT I TOLD HIM TO DISPOSE OF THE ORIGINAL, WHICH I BELIEVE WAS CRACKED IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE ONE IN THE PICTURES FOUND AT THIS WEBSITE  HTTP://PUBLIC.FOTKI.COM/TRSI/FORD_INTAKE_RECALL/  LAST NIGHT AS I WAS RUNNING SOME ERRANDS AROUND TOWN, MY CAR STARTED TO OVERHEAT.

CAR IS STILL IN THE GARAGE, SO I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS LEFT OR RIGHT, I PICK CAR UP TOMORROW, SO WITH RENTAL AND EVERYTHING I WILL SPEND APROXIMATELY $ 825.00 FOR THIS PROBLEM. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO AS THIS IS A SMALL TOWN GARAGE AND IF HE HAS DONE 6 NOW THINK OF A LARGER TOWN & GARAGE.

(SEE FORD DOCUMENT #97M91)  IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS A KNOWN AND ACKNOWLEDGED DEFECT WITH THE ENGINE IN QUESTION.  THIS IS A COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL, IF NOT POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING DEFECT.  THE SUPER-HEATED STEAM PRODUCED BY THE RUPTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ENGINE (RIGHT BEHIND THE FAN, NO LESS) BILLOWED OUT IN A PLUME OF STEAM THAT MADE ROAD-VISION NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE, NOT TO MENTION CAUSING A DEFINITELY DISTRACTING PANIC SITUATION!  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD, INCLUDING MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP (MOYER FORD, FOLEY ALABAMA), THEIR CUSTUOMER SERVICE \"HOTLINE\"  AND JONATHAN GRIMM AT FORD WHQ.  ALL HAVE REPEATED THE MANTRA, \"WE'RE SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IN THIS SITUATION.\"  ON THE INTERNET, I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, AND A LOCAL MECHANIC HAS STATED THAT HE HAS HAD TO REPLACE A NUMBER OF THE PLASTIC MANIFOLDS AS WELL.  I FEEL THIS IS A POTENTIALL SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT FORD IS WILLING TO IGNORE!  I WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER FOR THE POTENTIAL SAFETY OF OTHERS, AS WELL AS TO RECLAIM THE COSTS OF REPAIRING AN ADMITTED DEFECT IN FORD'S DESIGN AND MANUFACTURIN",
