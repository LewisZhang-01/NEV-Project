I'M AM BESIDE THE VEHICLE I'M ATTEMPTING TO PASS AND HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE DRIVING LANE. LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO DO SO BEFORE ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE  SINCE 2008 WITH THE THROTTLE BY WIRE SYSTEM. IT IS A MANUFACTURERS DESIGN DEFECT AND WHY HARLEY HAS NOT RECALLED IT IS BEYOND ME. IS NHTSA AND HARLEY WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO GET KILLED BEFORE INITIATING A RECALL?.....AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY UNDETERMINED ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THIS ISSUE? IT IS SUCH A COMMON OCCURRENCE THAT HARLEY ISSUED A DEALER BULLETIN (TT148A) TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME BY HARLEY SERVICE THAT THE PROBLEM IS AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE THROTTLE AND THE THROTTLE BODY DUE TO TWO DIFFERENT METALS CAUSING CORROSION. HARLEY ISN'T WILLING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITHOUT COST TO THE CUSTOMER. IT'S TIME FOR THE NHTSA TO STEP IN; SOONER RATHER THAN LATER!",
