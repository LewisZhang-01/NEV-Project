This exact piece was replaced in Aug 2019 under a recall (NHTSA campaign id: 19V086. GM recall id: N182182760). I believe the recall does not address the issue or I was given a faulty piece. The dealer replaced the part but at my expense. GM could not give me a reason for why I should be held responsible for a faulty piece even though they stated that the part that needed to be replace is a sealed part and the fault was an internal fault/short. I had no control over damaging the part and the dangers of sudden loss of power steering put me, my passengers, other drivers, and pedestrians at risk. Power was lost in the middle of a rain storm and I needed to drive over an hour with no power steering just to get back home. The difficulty to turn with no power steering was so difficult that I couldn't even parallel park/pull over in a safe manner.

The contact stated that when he attempted to jump start the vehicle, the vehicle remained off, but the passenger\u2019s side rear taillight illuminated, and the windshield wipers engaged independently. The contact was able to restart the vehicle after three attempts. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a dealer who diagnosed that the battery had failed. The vehicle was then taken to Connell Chevrolet (2828 Harbor Blvd, Costa Mesa, CA 92626) who diagnosed that the battery needed to be replaced. The battery was replaced, and the dealer test drove the vehicle but informed the contact that they could not duplicate the failure. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was opened. The approximate failure mileage was 42,767.",
