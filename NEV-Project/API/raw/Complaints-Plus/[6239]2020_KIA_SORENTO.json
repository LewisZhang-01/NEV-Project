        "summary": "Here\u2019s the deal, what I would is for the dealership to accept a fair trade of equal monthly payments on a new Kia Sorento 2022. So here\u2019s the deal I have a 2020 Kia Sorento LX looking to do a even trade for a 2022 Kia Sorento, same monthly payments of 540. I\u2019ve filed a complaint with corporate about a issue I\u2019ve had with my current kia which it has had a issue running around 4k rpm in sport mode and won\u2019t drop down below normal ranges until in smart mode when I brought it in for its routine maintenance they said that the transmission was just catching up to the speed? Well on February 11th  my wife was driving my car and the car experienced a issue were the engine was loud and car was slow an couldn\u2019t get above 60mph. My cars drive SyncUP got this error code Transmission Range Sensor Circuit Malfunction (PRNDLInput) (P0705), took it into kia east the next day, they claimed everything was safe and they couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with it after having 3 techs look at it. On February 13th on Alabama highway going 70mph my blind spot collision warning came on, car made a clunking noise from the transmission, felt like we got hit, went from 70mph to 30mph. Completely unsafe, had to restart the car an seems to run normal for now but I do not feel safe in this car anymore. The same issue I got the second time was the same code that I got the first time, I have reached out on social media to see if others have had this issue since kia should have started a investigation to determine the root cause of this issue an have had another person step forward with the same experience. This is completely unacceptable and unsafe to have to second guess a vehicle that I was ensured would be completely safe after having it looked at. I\u2019ve already contacted corporate about the issue, they are looking into it now. I have yet to hear back from the kia general manager, they are offering to trade the car in but yet have more negative equity on the car, how about a fair trade.",

The 13 yr old in the 3rd row, his seatbelt was dislodged and sustain bruising and scrapes on his right side of his face. The 7 yr old complained about his stomach, but his seat belt did not dislodge.

TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO INSTALL A NEW TRANSMISSION IN IT.  FOUND OUT WHEN I PICK UP THE VEHICLE UP THAT THEY IN FACT INSTALLED A REBUILT TRANSMISSION, VEHICLE NOW HAS 1100 MILES ON IT.  PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED.  TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK AND THE DEALER I WAS INFORMED THAT A KAI REP WAS GOING TO COME OUT AND LOOK AT THE VEHICLE.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID HE LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND DROVE IT.  THE KIA REP THEN DROVE ANOTHER SORRENTO ON THE LOT AND REPORTED BACK THAT MY SORRENTO WAS 'OPERATING AS DESIGNED'. I ALSO DROVE TWO OTHER V6 8 SPEED SORRENTO'S THAT WERE ON THE LOT AND THEY WERE BOTH HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  IN MY 45 YEARS OF DRIVING I HAVE NEVER HAD A TRANSMISSION BEHAVE LIKE THIS UNLESS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH IT.  I HAVE ESCALATED THE ISSUE TO THE KIA CUSTOMER CARE CENTER (800) 333-4542.  THE CUSTOMER CARE CENTER ARE LIKE LEMMINGS AND ONLY READ BACK TO ME WHAT THE DEALERSHIP AND SO CALLED EXPERT ENTERED IN TO THE SYSTEM.  I WAS ADVISED BY THE CUSTOMER CARE REPRESENTATIVE THAT IF I WANTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM MYSELF I COULD DO SO AND IF KIA DID PUT OUT A SERVICE BULLETIN OR RECALL I COULD BE REIMBURSED FOR MY EXPENSES.",
