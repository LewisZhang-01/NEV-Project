I was in the passing lane when I felt the vehicle lose power (I initially thought it was a strong headwind as we were experiencing the tail-end of a hurricane here in the northeast).  This happened for  only a second and then everything seemed normal again.  It happened again and I realized none of the trees on the side of the road indicated we were having any wind at all. I immediately worked my way into the right hand lane and as I did, the engine revved to about 5,000 RPMs and the vehicle lost power. There were highway maintenance vehicles in the breakdown lane so I put the vehicle in neutral and coasted beyond them so I could get into the breakdown lane.   I narrowly avoided being hit by a tractor trailer when this vehicle's transmission disengaged without any warning.   I only have 93,000 miles and the vehicle was bought brand new by me  and driven only highway miles.  There were absolutely no warning signs or emergency warning lights on the dash to indicate any type of failure.   I was able to get this to the local Nissan dealership and they told me the transmission had failed and would need replacement at the cost of $4,600.00 and that Nissan would do nothing to offset any part of this repair.   This vehicle is a death trap that I would never put another dime into.  Someone will get killed if this is happening to other people.  I almost did.  After some research, it appears Nissan has avoided having a recall, despite multiple issues being reported on several sites, over what appears to be several years. If you value your loved ones, stay away from Nissan as the transmission failing on the highway without warning could be a deadly mistake.  It nearly was for me, and an accident reconstruction team would never think to tear apart the transmission, especially with no warning lights or codes indicated.",

Around June 1, 2020 I took my 2018 Nissan Rogue back to Nashville Downtown Nissan to repair the sudden braking problem again.  They wanted to charge me $2,000 because it was no longer under warranty.  I said that I did not have $2,000.  So they told me to pay $182 for checking it.  Now I drive my 2018 Nissan Rogue in fear of someone crashing into me.  Nissan should be ashamed for letting this problem persist without offering A recall.",

I\u2019m shocked there has not been a recall for this after reading online of other complaints and lawsuits. Huge safety issue. This isn\u2019t a bad water pump issue it\u2019s a peoples lives issue. I called Nissan and opened a case with them (case # 43890104) for the issue and to try to get my $165.00 back that I had to pay my local Nissan dealer. Although Nissan is going to reimburse me the $165.00 I paid, I strongly feel it needs a recall for this issue. People need to be aware that their lives are in danger.  Please help.

I TOOK IT BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THE ISSUE BEGAN AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND THAT IT WAS A COMMON ISSUE OF MY FRONT-DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR FAILING AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. FEELING DEFEATED AFTER TRYING TO REASON WITH MANAGEMENT THAT IT WAS NOT HAVING THIS ISSUE BEFORE THEY SERVICED MY VEHICLE, I DECIDED TO LEAVE IT ALONE. HOWEVER, RECENTLY MY NIECE AND I WERE OUT SHOPPING AND NOTICED THAT WE WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY A STRANGE ACTING MAN. WE TOOK OFF RUNNING TOWARD MY VEHICLE TRYING TO REACH SAFETY, BUT WHAT HAPPENS? THE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR FAILS AND I'M UNABLE TO ENTER MY OWN VEHICLE! OUR ONLY SAVING GRACE WAS THAT ANOTHER MAN IN THE PARKING LOT NOTICED THAT WE WERE TRYING TO FLEA FROM DANGER AND INTERVENED TO GET THE OTHER MAN AWAY FROM US. IT WAS TERRIFYING! I'M NOT SURE WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO MY NIECE AND I HAD HE NOT STEPPED IN AND I HATE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. FAST FORWARD A FEW DAYS AND IT BEGINS TO RAIN FOR DAYS STRAIGHT AND I'M LEFT FIDDLING WITH MY KEYS TO OPEN MY DOOR, WHILE ALSO HOLDING A PURSE, BABY BAG, AND BABY ON MY HIP AND TRYING TO BALANCE AN UMBRELLA TO KEEP US DRY. IMAGINE THE SIGHT OF THAT. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING! AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE MY KEY BATTERY WAS DYING AND DECIDED TO GET THE BATTERY REPLACED BEFORE RETURNING TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT THE BATTERY WAS NOT THE ISSUE. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR FAILURE AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A MANUFACTURING ERROR AND SAFETY HAZARD. I BOUGHT THE 2018 NISSAN ROGUE BECAUSE I LOVED MY 2017 ROGUE AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THE ISSUES THAT THIS NEWER MODEL HAS GIVEN ME. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! NISSAN SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!",

THERE IS ALSO SEPARATION (GAP) OCCURRING BETWEEN THE REAR BUMPER COVER AND QUARTER PANELS.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE AS I PURCHASED IT NEW.  THE MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT WHETHER THE PANELS WILL SEPARATE WHILE DRIVING AND CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT THAT COULD RESULT IN INJURIES TO OCCUPANTS OF MY VEHICLE OR OTHERS.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP OF PURCHASE AND THEY REPAIRED ONLY THE LEFT FRONT SIDE SO I AM NOT SATISFIED AS I CAN STILL SEE THE GAPS.  THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY GAPS BETWEEN THE PANELS AT ALL.  IT IS STRESSFUL HAVING TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WHILE WORRYING ABOUT IF SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.   I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN USA ABOUT THE ISSUE.  NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN THE GAP STARTED BUT NOTICED IT AROUND 08/01/2019.  THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ACCIDENT OR ANYTHING.",

THE REASON WHY WE ARE GETTING LESS GAS MILEAGE IN THE 2018 AWD IS BECAUSE THE 4X4-I SYSTEM IS RUNNING 50% TORQUE ON REAR WHEELS LONGER THEN NEEDED! IN THE '17.5 IT RUNS 50% TORQUE IN THE FIRST GEAR UPON TAKE OFF AND THEN ADJUST AS NEEDED (SWITCH YOUR DISPLAY TO THE 4X4-I AND WATCH HOW LONG THE TORQUE IS USED ON THE REAR WHEELS)!  ON A DRY SURFACE YOU DO NOT NEED THAT MUCH TORQUE THROUGHOUT THE OTHER GEARS! I POINTED THAT OUT TO THE TECHNICIAN AND HE GAVE ME A SLIGHT NOD! (THE ACCELERATOR SENSOR, YAW RATE SENSOR OR 4WD CONTROLLER MAY NOT BE WORKING CORRECTLY!) AND THE FINAL ISSUE IS THE ENGINE BRAKE IS NOT ENGAGING WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN TO BETWEEN 25 TO 40 MPH  THE TECH ODOMETER SHOULD RISE UP TO 2 TO 4 RPM  ACCORDING TO YOUR SPEED WHILE APPROACHING A STOPLIGHT OR STOPPING  AND IN THE 2018 IT DOESN'T DO THAT IT RISES UP TO ABOUT 1.5 RPMS!
