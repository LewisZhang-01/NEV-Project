        "summary": "ON OR ABOUT 09/07/17, MY SON WAS DRIVING MY 2010 DODGE AVENGER. THERE IS A MAJOR ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. WHEN STARTING TO DRIVE, THE GAUGES AND SPEEDOMETER AND WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CRAZY OR STOPPED WORKING. NOTHING WORKED LIKE IT SHOULD. THEN AT A STOP THE VEHICLE DIED AND WOULDN'T RESTART. GOT THE CAR JUMP STARTED AND WAS BROUGHT HOME. UPON INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM BY MY OTHER SON A MECHANIC, THERE SEEMED TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE BATTERY, ALTERNATOR, OR PCM. ONCE THE BATTERY WAS REPLACED EVERYTHING APPEARED FINE FOR ABOUT A 30 MINUTE DRIVE, THEN SAME ISSUE. VEHICLE THEN WAS TAKEN TO A DODGE DEALER WHO AFTER A WEEK COULDN'T DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR, NOT THE ISSUE. FINAL RESULT IS THE PCM IS FAULTY. OK, JUST ONE PROBLEM. WHEN TRYING TO GET ONE FROM THE DEALER ON WEST COAST, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PCM'S ARE ON BACK ORDER. IN FACT OVER 365 ARE ON B/O. CONTACTED 3 OTHER CHRYSLER SUPPLIERS/WAREHOUSES AROUND THE NATION, AND WAS ADVISED THAT THERE WERE OVER 700 NATION WIDE ON B/O AND NONE ARE TO BE HAD. CONTACTED AUTO PART STORES, (ORIELLY, AUTO ZONE, NAPA, ETC) AND WAS MET WITH THE SAME RESULTS. THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE A NATION WIDE PROBLEM AND SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE JUST STOPPING/RUNNING AND NO READILY AVAILABLE FIX FOR THE PROBLEM. I CONTACTED DODGE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MADE MY COMPLAINT TO THEM. THE DODGE REP AGREED THAT THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A MAJOR WARRANTY ISSUE, DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF BACK ORDERS AND AVAILABILITY. HE GAVE ME A CAMPAIGN # 32502195 AS HE OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE. I DID FIND ONE AUTO COMPUTER REBUILDER THAT MAY BE ABLE TO REPAIR MY PCM, COULD TAKE UP TO 10 WEEKS (+) TO GET IT BACK. THIS ISSUE RESEMBLES THE RECALL ON THE 2008/09 AVENGER PCM ISSUE. ANY ASSISTANCE YOU COULD GIVE ME WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.",

IN ADDITION THE MANUFACTURER INCLUDED ALL OF THE SPEEDS I.E 40, 50 ,60 ETC, ON THE DIAL CREATING A VERY CROWDED DIAL THAT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO READ WHILE DRIVING.  MOST MANUFACTURERS ONLY INDICATE EVERY SECOND SPEED, I.E  20, 40, 60 MPH FOR CLARITY.  THE CAR WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND KEEP AT POSTED SPEED DUE TO THIS DEFECT.  A QUICK GLANCE AT THE SQUARED LETTERS ALL CROWDED TOGETHER MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT AT WHAT SPEED THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN.  THE 50 AND 60 MPH INDICATIONS WERE BASICALLY IDENTICAL WHEN READ WITH A QUICK GLANCE WHICH IS TYPICAL IN NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.    MANUFACTURERS SHOULD KEEP SPEED INDICATORS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. DODGE DID A VERY POOR JOB WITH THESE SPEEDOMETERS WHICH TEND TO CONFUSE DRIVERS.      I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT BETTER STANDARDS FOR SPEEDOMETERS BE ENACTED TO PREVENT DRIVERS FROM MAKING MISTAKES WHEN READING THE SPEED AT WHICH THE CAR IS GOING.    I HAVE TAKE A PICTURE OF THIS SPEEDOMETER WHICH I WOULD BE GLAD TO PROVIDE TO YOU.    THANKS.  *TR",
