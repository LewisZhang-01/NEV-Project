RECALL REPAIRS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED UNTIL LATE 2018. I DO NOT WANT TO WAIT 4 MONTHS TO GET A REPAIR SINCE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  I TALKED TO MY LOCAL SERVICE PERSON AT AUDI DANVERS, MA WHO CONFIRMED THE RECALL REPAIR IS NOT YET AVAILABLE.  I ALSO EMAILED AUDI USA BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE.  WHAT CAN I DO TO GET THIS RECTIFIED?",
