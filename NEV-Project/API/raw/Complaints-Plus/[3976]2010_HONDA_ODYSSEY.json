When doing a search on the web, I saw the recall notice for Honda Odyssey 2011-12. https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2019/MC-10161239-0001.pdf  My Honda Odyssey is a 2010 model but with same color and similar problems with exterior paint. This would result in corrosion and ultimately the safety of the vehicle. I am attaching the pictures of my vehicle. I did contact Honda and they advised me to get the vehicle inspected at their service center. I am scheduled to visit them for diagnosis soon, but wanted to share what I found as there recall with 2011-12 is something that clearly extends to other years model as well.",

SHE GOT PRETTY SCARED AND GAVE ME A CALL. THEN, WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER THAT WE HAD PURCHASED. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SPARK PLUGS HAD OIL LEAKED THROUGH THE ENGINE. THEY REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS AND THE ISSUE OF SIGNIFICANT SHAKING WAS RESOLVED. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN CHECKING THE OIL LEVEL AND EACH WEEK I AM ADDING A QUARTER OF OIL. THEN, I HAVE GONE THROUGH SOME SEARCH AND FOUND THAT 2008-2013 ODYSSEY MODELS ARE POWERED BY A SIX-CYLINDER ENGINE WITH A VARIABLE CYLINDER MANAGEMENT (VCM) SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS OIL TO LEAK INTO THE ENGINE'S COMBUSTION CHAMBER, LEADING TO PREMATURE SPARK PLUG DEGRADATION, REDUCED FUEL ECONOMY, AND EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION.   AS A RESULT, MANY ODYSSEY OWNERS REPORT HAVING TO REPLACE THEIR SPARK PLUGS FREQUENTLY AND REFILL THE MOTOR WITH OIL BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. THIS IS WHAT I AM EXACTLY HAVING. I HAVE CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER CARE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT YOUR VAN IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE AS IT IS 8 YEARS 7 MONTHS OLD AND IF IT WAS LESS THAN 8 YEARS, IT WAS GOING TO BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. MY CONCERN IS EXCESSIVE OIL LEAKAGE ON A LONG TRIP CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ENGINE HEATING AND/OR SIGNIFICANT SHAKING OF WHOLE VEHICLE MAY REPEAT WHEN I AM ON AN INTERSTATE AND MY WHOLE FAMILY CAN FACE AN SERIOUS ACCIDENT ISSUE.

UPON COMPLETION, THE SERVICE REPORT INDICATED THAT A PCM SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS ALSO APPLIED FOR LOCK-UP CLUTCH FUNCTION PER RECALL 09-053 ODYSSEY LC JUDDER. WHILE WE HAD EXPERIENCED TRANSMISSION JUDDER AND VIBRATION WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS ACCELERATING BETWEEN 25 TO 35 MPH, WE WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY NOTIFICATION OR RECALL AT ALL. AROUND JULY 2016, THE TRANSMISSION JUDDER AND HESITATION, COMBINED WITH SOME SUDDEN ACCELERATION CAME BACK AND WE SCHEDULED TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO THE SAME DEALER FOR INSPECTION IN EARLY AUGUST 2016. THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND A MINIMUM HOURLY LABOR CHARGE OF $115 WOULD APPLY FOR DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM. AT THE END, THE SERVICE REPORT INDICATED THAT FLUID LEVEL WAS GOOD, TRANSMISSION JUDDER WAS CONFIRMED TO OCCUR BETWEEN 20 - 40 MPH ON ROAD TEST, AND THE TORQUE CONVERTOR SHOULD BE REPLACED AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF $1,900 TO FIX THE PROBLEM. WE CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT IT AND RECEIVED NO ASSISTANCE. THE TORQUE CONVERTOR ON THIS VEHICLE IS APPARENTLY A DEFECT AND HONDA OFFERED ONLY A TEMPORARY QUICK FIX WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. OUR ODYSSEY HAS ONLY 46,500 MILES ON IT, BUT THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAS PASSED. PLEASE HELP AND INVESTIGATE.",

THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME A SPEC FOR THE PEDAL HEIGHT.  INTERESTING.  I GUESS THE PEDAL CAN NEVER BE TOO LOW IF THERE'S NO SPEC, ONLY SUBJECTIVE TO WHAT HONDA WANTS TO ADMIT IS BAD OR NOT.  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I HAVE A 1989 LINCOLN MARK VII WITH THE ORGINAL FORD SERVICE MANUAL.  THERE IS A SPECIFIC RANGE FOR THE PEDAL HEIGHT WHEN MEASURED FROM THE FLOOR BOARD.  SURPRISING HOW FORD HAS HAD IT SINCE 1989 AND HONDA IS NOT REQUIRED.  AGAIN - WE CAN ALL THINK THE PEDAL IS TOO LOW BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY HONDA'S OPINION SINCE THERE'S NOTHING TO MEASURE IT AGAINST.    I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE SINCE IT WAS BRAND NEW SO I KNOW HOW THE BRAKES USED TO, AND SHOULD FEEL.    GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THE WEB WITH SIMILAR STORIES FROM THE DEALERS AND HONDA I HOPE NHTSA WILL FINALLY FORCE THIS ISSUE INTO A RECALL BY REASSESSING THE VEHICLES STOPPING DISTANCE AGAINST WHAT WAS ADVERTISED.

AS WE WERE APPROACHING THE HIGHWAY ON-RAMP, THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED (BRAKE) FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHILE I HAD MY FOOT ON THE GAS! I MADE A U-TURN TO GET AWAY FROM THE ON-RAMP AND GO HOME. THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVING RIGHT. THE CAR SLOWED/STOPPED 2 MORE TIMES. I WAS ON MY STREET, WHEN THE \"BRAKES WENT OUT\". I COASTED INTO MY DRIVEWAY.  SMOKE BEGAN BILLOWING OUT OF FRONT WHEEL WELLS. WHEN I WAS TURNING OFF THE IGNITION, THE VSA LIGHT CAME ON. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE CAR WAS ON FIRE, SO I RUSHED MY KIDS OUT OF THE CAR AND CALLED 911. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL SMOKING, HOT, AND SMELLING.      I HAD CAR TOWED. THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND WAS GOING TO GET HONDA INVOLVED. THEY COULD NOT SEE ANY PROBLEMS AND COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE EVENT. MY SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THAT THE CAR WAS \"DRIVABLE\", BUT DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE LETTING ME TAKE IT. I SAID THAT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TAKING IT BECAUSE I CAN?T TRUST ITS SAFETY.    JANUARY 5- I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT A VERY RECENT RECALL ON THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH A YAW SENSOR TELLING THE VSA SYSTEM TO ENGAGE WHILE THE CAR IS ACCELERATING WITHOUT THE BRAKE LIGHTS TURNING ON. NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE! THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT MY CAR IS NOT NAMED IN THIS RECALL. ONLY 2007-2008 HONDA ODYSSEY OWNERS WERE NOTIFIED. I HAVE A 2010. ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS, HONDA DOES NOT HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT WILL EXPLAIN TO OWNERS WHAT TO DO IN CASE THIS SUDDEN STOPPING OCCURS. I AM DUMBFOUNDED! THERE IS NOT A CHANCE THAT MY CHILDREN AND I WILL GET INTO THAT CAR WITH \"INSTRUCTIONS\" IN THE EVENT THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.  IT SEEMS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT CONTAINED TO 2007-2008 MODELS. IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HONDA NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS INITIAL RECALL. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE WARNED ABOUT THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY PROBLEM.   *TR",

THE CHECK RODS DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESISTANCE TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN. WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED AND THE FRONT DOOR IS IN THE FULLY OPENED POSITION, THE DOOR IS PRONE TO SWING SHUT. THIS OCCURS IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS: ON A LEVEL SURFACE, IF THE DOOR IS PUSHED OPEN, THE DOOR WILL SOMETIMES SWING BACK ON THE OCCUPANT; THE FULLY OPENED DOOR WILL ALSO SWING SHUT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS ON EVEN A SLIGHT INCLINE OR IS BLOWN BY A GUST OF WIND. THE CHECK RODS DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESISTANCE TO KEEP THE DOOR IN THE OPEN POSITION WHEN FULLY EXTENDED. THESE ARE VERY HEAVY DOORS AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY.  MY WIFE AND I HAVE BOTH EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS INSTANCES IN WHICH THE DOOR HAS STARTED SWINGING SHUT IN EACH OF THESE SITUATIONS. I DISCUSSED THIS CONCERN WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AT MY LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP AND I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO AMERICAN HONDA (CASE #  [XXX]). I COMPARED THE FRONT DOOR CHECK ROD MECHANISM IN THE 2012 HONDA ODYSSEY ON THE DEALER?S LOT. THE CHECK ROD ON THE 2012 ODYSSEY FUNCTIONED PROPERLY, CREATING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESISTANCE WHEN THE DOOR WAS FULLY EXTENDED. THE SERVICE MANAGER ORDERED A SET OF 2012 ODYSSEY CHECK RODS, WITH THE HOPE THEY COULD BE INSTALLED ON MY 2010 ODYSSEY.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 2012 RODS DID NOT MATCH AND COULD NOT BE INSTALLED ON MY VEHICLE.  AMERICAN HONDA HAS DECLINED TO TAKE ANY REMEDIAL ACTION.  I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE DEFECT IN THE CHECK ROD USED IN THE 2010 ODYSSEY MODEL LED TO A REDESIGN OF THE CHECK ROD MECHANISM FOR SUBSEQUENT VEHICLE YEARS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOUR OFFICE CHECK INTO THIS MATTER AND ADDRESS THE DEFECT IN THE 2010 ODYSSEY CHECK ROD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.
