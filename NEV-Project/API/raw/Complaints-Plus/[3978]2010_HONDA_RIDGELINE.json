The contact stated that the failure happened every time it rained. The contact said there was a strong mildew odor inside the vehicle. Additionally, the headliner separated inside the vehicle. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed with a crack on the roof of the vehicle on the driver\u2019s side. The contact was notified by the dealer that the vehicle needed to be spot welded to repair the crack. The manufacturer was contacted by the dealer and made aware of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The dealer told the contact that the manufacturer did not spot weld the section of the roof since it could impact the integrity of the sub-frame. The failure mileage was approximately 74,570.",

When applying the brake, the vehicle suddenly accelerated unintentionally and hit the car in the opposing parking space.  I stood on the brake harder when I sensed the vehicle lurching forward.  After I struck the opposing car, I confirmed that my foot was on the brake and not touching the accelerator.  Also, oddly the vehicle immediately stopped running and I noticed the car was in Reverse.  I took pictures and video immediately after the incident both inside the car and outside before I touched anything.  I then put the car in Park, started the car, and backed it up.  I inspected both cars for damage and did not find any damage.  I left a note for the other car.  The owner later called and confirmed she did not find any damage.  One interesting thing that I noticed is that the parking space had a sewer drain in the front left corner that had a large slope and snow/ice surrounding it.  The unintended acceleration occurred right when the front left tire hit that sloping ice patch.",
