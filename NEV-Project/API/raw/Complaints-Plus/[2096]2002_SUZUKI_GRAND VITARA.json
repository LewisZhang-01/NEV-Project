THE CRUISE CONTROL MADE THE CAR JUMP INTO A LOWER GEAR WHEN ASCENDING A HILL TO KEEP IT AT 55 MPH. THE RPM'S JUMPED FROM ABOUT 2,000 TO 5,000 WHEN THE CAR SHIFTED INTO 3RD GEAR - WHICH CAUSED THE TIRES TO LOSE TRACTION AND I WRECKED INTO 2 HIGHWAY SIGN POSTS AND SKIDDED SIDEWAYS ABOUT 50 YARDS INTO THE CENTER MEDIAN. IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT I DIDN'T ROLL OVER SEVERAL TIMES. IT COST ME $5,000 IN COLLISION DAMAGE TO FIX THE CAR. THE CRUISE CONTROL DOES THIS ALL THE TIME STILL WHEN EVEN ON MODERATE HILLS TO KEEP UP WITH THE SET MPH. IT IS A DESIGN FLAW IN MY OPINION.
