ON THE THIRD DAY I HAD IT, WHILE DRIVING IN A 45 MPH ZONE, THE GAS PEDAL SUDDENLY PULLED AWAY FROM MY FOOT AND WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.  I WAS NOT USING CRUISE CONTROL SO I TRIED PULLING THE PEDAL UP BY PLACING MY FOOT UNDER IT AND PULLING UP. THAT DIDN'T WORK SO I HIT THE GAS PEDAL A FEW TIMES, BELIEVING IT WAS STUCK SOMEHOW.  WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK I HIT THE BRAKES TO PULL THE CAR OVER.  THE CAR WAS QUICKLY GAINING SPEED AS I DID ALL OF THESE THINGS AND HITTING THE BRAKES DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL.  THEN I STOOD ON THE BRAKES WITH BOTH FEET WHILE THE CAR WAS UP TO 80 MPH.  STANDING ON THE BRAKES WITH BOTH FEET ONLY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO 60 MPH.  I THEN MANAGED TO GET THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL GEAR AND PULL IT OVER ON THE SHOULDER BY ALSO USING THE BRAKES, BUT IT WAS REVVING HIGH AND BLACK SMOKE WAS NOW COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND RAN DOWN THE ROAD AWAY FROM THE CAR, WHEN THE CAR STARTED SPARKING UNDERNEATH, THEN IT BROKE INTO FLAMES.  THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND 2 TIRES EXPLODED BEFORE THE FIRE COMPANY ARRIVED.  *JB",
