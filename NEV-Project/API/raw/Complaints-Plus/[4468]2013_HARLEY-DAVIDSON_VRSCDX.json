        "summary": "THE NIGHT ROD SPECIAL FUEL GUAGE DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY. AFTER FILLING UP, IT SHOWED LESS THAN 1/2 TANK IN CITY DRIVING. AFTER DRIVING A SHORT DISTANCE AND RESTARTING, IT SHOWED ABOUT 3/4 FULL. AS THE DRIVE CONTINUED ON A HIGHWAY, IT INCREASED TO POSSIBLY THE CORRECT FUEL LEVEL. AFTER STOPPING WITH APPROXIMATELY 1/2 OF A TANK, ONCE RESTARTED, IT DROPPED RAPIDLY TO EMPTY, FUEL LIGHT CAME ON, AND REMAINING DISTANCE STATED ZERO. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO A GAS STATION TO FILL UP. ONLY 2.5 GALLONS OF THE 5 GAL TANK WERE USED. I HAVE READ ON MULTIPLE SITES AND FORUMS THAT HARLEY-DAVIDSONS, IN PARTICULAR THE VRODS, FUEL GUAGE ARE NOTORIOUS FOR WORKING IMPROPERLY. THIS IS A SAFETY MATTER AND MUST BE FIXED BY HD.",
