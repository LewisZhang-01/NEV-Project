I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS AND WAS TOLD THEY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE 604E AUTOMATIC OVERDRIVE TRANSMISSION BUT THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, IT IS MY PROBLEM.  IT HAS COST ME A SMALL FORTUNE TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE RUNNING, I HOPE MY 2002 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY IS BETTER IN QUALITY, IF NOT I WILL GO TO THE NEWS MEDIA ABOUT IT.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE 89 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER LE OUT OF TOWN FOR FEAR OF TRANSMISSION FAILURE, IT SEEMS THAT IF I SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART IT WHEN THIS OCCURS SOMETIMES IT WILL WORK PROPERLY AGAIN FOR A SHORT TIME AND AT OTHER TIMES IT WILL NOT RUN IN ANY GEAR EXCEPT LOW AND REVERSE.  I THINK IT IS TIME FOR A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST CHRYSLER TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AND ALSO TO REIMBURSE ALL THE OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITH THIS TRANSMISSION FOR THE MONIES THEY HAVE SPENT AND ALSO MONEY FOR THE TROUBLE IT HAS CAUSED.  *LA",

FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED, CHRYSLER DEALERSHIPS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, RESULTING IN CHRYSLER CORPORATION PAYING FOR THIS DEFECT.  IN THE PAST YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS CAR, NO-ONE HAS EVER TOLD ME OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION 3 TIMES, THE MOST RECENT ONLY LASTED 9,000 MILES.  THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAVE BOUGHT, AND TAKEN MY VEHICLE FOR REPAIRS HAS NEGLECTED TO TELL ME OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS REPAIRING THIS VEHICLE, AND I'M TIRED OF IT.  FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN, IT SEEMS TO ME I'M NOT BEING TOLD EVERYTHING, OR THE DEALER IS TRYING TO MAKE A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT AT MY EXPENSE.   AGAIN, I WOULD PLEASE LIKE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, HOPEFULLY GETTING MY MONEY BACK FROM THE PAST TRANSMISSION I HAD REPLACED.
