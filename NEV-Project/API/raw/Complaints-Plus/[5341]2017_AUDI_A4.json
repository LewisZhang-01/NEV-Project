        "summary": "I have been an Audi A4 owner for more than 10 years. During that time, I have had 2 incidents where I could have easily been killed as well as injured or killed passengers in oncoming vehicles. The latest was this morning on March 23, 2022. The other was nearly 10 years ago. My personal investigation has led me to a conclusion that I have not yet seen anywhere else.  In both cases, I am trying to get into a heavy flow of traffic. I know that I will have to \"gun it\" to get up to speed. For that reason, I have one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake. When traffic opens to where I think it is safe to proceed, I press the accelerator while my foot is still on the brake. In the situation this morning, I intended to execute a sharp right turn into the closest lane of a road with 2-lanes going in that direction. I pressed the accelerator hard while turning the steering wheel. Instead of turning right, the car shot across both lanes of traffic, wiped out a traffic sign and entered the lanes of oncoming traffic. I had zero control. It was only dumb luck that I avoided traffic in both directions (both of which were travelling at roughly 60 mph).  Even though I knew about this risk from my earlier incident, I didn't think about it at the time.   I realize that my actions send conflicting signals to the car (go/don't go), but the last thing the car should do is propel itself forward with no control on the part of the driver.  I don't know if this is limited to Audi or the A4, but I wanted to make my experience public to possibly avoid a serious or fatal accident by someone else. It is very avoidable with proper knowledge and attention.  I'd be interested in knowing if you have been notified of any other incidents of this type.",

It is obvious that the leak has been occurring for awhile as there is dried white residue all around this area.   The engine cover under the engine compartment was all wet with coolant.   The coolant reservoir was also low.    The car's information system did not indicate an issue, but I am sure it would have eventually (at probably a very inconvenient time and location ! ).

We purchased a used 2017 A4 Audi Sedan in October 2019. In early November 2020 the passenger side airbag warning light came on. After adjusting the front passenger seat, the light went off. Thereafter, the light would intermittently go on and off. We took the car to the dealer from whom we bought it - Royal Automotive Group in San Francisco. Their technician tested the car and confirmed a fault code #DTC B1225F1. They found \"tsb #2051242/5 for issue and fault\" and installed \"cable tie per tsb.\" We continued to drive the car without incident until September 2021when the problem happened again. The passenger side airbag warning light began going on and off intermittently both when the front passenger seat was occupied and when it was not. Since we had moved from San Francisco to Novato, we took the car to Audi Marin. They verified the concern and found fault code P122F51. They confirmed the tsb recommended repair had already been done and told us it was first repaired on August 2, 2019 (before we bought the car) and again in November 2020 when we reported the problem to Royal Automotive Group in San Francisco. Audi Marin's recommended repair is to replace the passenger side seat POD which would cost approximately $2,000. We have been advised that the defective passenger side air bag and/or seat sensor pad constitutes a safety hazard because the airbag system may not work. We have since learned that several Audi models have been recalled for defects in the passenger occupant detection system (PODS). In March of 2021, it was announced Audi is recalling virtually all A3, RS3 and S3 cars built from 2015 to 2020 to address the risk that the PODS may malfunction and turn off the airbag when someone is in the front passenger seat.",

I can clearly see the coolant reservoir tank leaking and upon googling this issue, it looks like a lot of 2017 A4s have the same issue, yet there has been no recall to fix this issue.",

A SHARP PIECE OF METAL TRIM LABELED \"BANG & OLUFSON\" (SEE PHOTO) HAD SEMI-DETACHED FROM THE DOOR PANEL AND LACERATED HER FOOT, PIERCING THROUGH HER FOOT AND COMING OUT BETWEEN HER TOES.  THIS METAL TRIM PIECE LOOKED LIKE A SHARP KNIFE BLADE, AND HAD COME OUT OF ITS GLUED SPOT ON THE DOOR, STICKING OUT AT A 25-30 DEGREE ANGLE. I PUT PRESSURE ON THE WOUND AND REMOVED THE PIECE FROM THE CAR TO PREVENT FURTHER INJURY, CUTTING MYSELF IN THE PROCESS. IT WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD.   I IMMEDIATELY DROVE HER TO THE ER AT MERCY HOSPITAL. DR. MILLER, A PLASTIC SURGEON, SPENT 2  HOURS CLEANING THE WOUND, PULLING THE FLAYED SKIN BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION, AND STITCHING TENDONS AND BLOOD VESSELS THAT WERE AFFECTED IN THE INJURY. HE PLACED CONTINUOUS ABSORBABLE SUTURES THE LENGTH OF THE WOUND. (SEE PHOTO)  SHE WAS DISCHARGED WITH ORDERS NOT TO WALK OR PUT ANY WEIGHT ON THE FOOT, EXCEPT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, FOR AT LEAST 3 WEEKS. THE DOCTOR TOLD HER SHE MAY LOSE THE SKIN ON THE FOOT AND MAY HAVE TO RECEIVE SKIN GRAFTS TO REPAIR THE WOUND.   MY DAUGHTER WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN AND IT IS STILL UNKNOWN WHETHER SHE WILL HAVE PERMANENT SCARRING OR PAIN, OR IF SHE WILL REGAIN FULL FUNCTIONING OF THE FOOT. SHE HAS UNDERGONE A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND REMAINED ON BED REST FOR 30 DAYS SINCE THE INCIDENT.  THE SHARP METAL BLADE WAS ONLY GLUED ON THE DOOR SURFACE, WITH NO SCREWS TO ATTACH IT TO THE DOOR.
