JUST CALLED LIBERTY MAZDA TODAY AND GOT THE SAME STORY THAT MAZDA (CA) WAS ORDERING THE PART AND THEY SAW AN INVOICE THERE BUT HAD NO IDEA WHEN IT WOULD BE IN.  I FEEL THAT LIBERTY MAZDA IS GIVING US THE RUN AROUND.  WE ALREADY BROUGHT THE CAR IN ONCE FOR THE RECALL AND NOTHING HAPPENED.  NOW WE KEEP GETTING TOLD THAT A PART THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ORDERED ON AUG. 17TH MAY NOT BE IN UNTIL AFTER THE 27TH?  NOT SURE HOW PARTS ARE SHIPPED BUT I CALLED ANOTHER LOCAL DEALER YESTERDAY (AUG 23) WHO SAID IF HE ORDERED THE PART THAT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE IT BY SATURDAY. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET RESOLVED SINCE JULY 19TH!",

        "summary": "MAZDA CX-7 RECALL 9716H.  RCVD RECALL NOTICE IN 10/2016 BUT NO FURTHER NOTICES & TOLD IN NOTICE THAT PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THE DANGEROUS RECALL.  HAD NO IDEA HOW DISASTROUS THIS PROBLEM COULD BE.  DRIVING MY CX-7 ON OLD WILLETS PATH, SMITHTOWN, NY ON 2/3/17 @ APPROX. 6:30PM WITH MY 4 CHILDREN IN THE CAR, TRAVELING LESS THAN 35 MPH WHEN THE RIGHT WHEEL CAME OFF THE AXLE OF THE CAR.  THE WHEEL WAS THE RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER SIDE OF CAR.  THE CAR THEN BEGAN TO TURN INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AS A RESULT OF LOSING CONTROL OF THE CAR. CARS HAD TO MOVE OUT OF MY WAY AS IT WAS ALMOST OUT OF CONTROL. I FEARED FOR THE LIFE OF MYSELF AND MY 4 KIDS IN THE CAR. THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO LUCKILY GAIN CONTROL OF THE CAR DUE TO MY 30+ YRS  EXPERIENCE AS A DRIVER AND FORCE THE CAR ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD, SLIDING INTO DIRT. THE CAR SKIDDED APPROX 75 FEET ON PAVEMENT. (PHOTOS ATTACHED) THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS DIAGNOSED BY MY MECHANIC AS THE BALL JOINT AND LOWER CONTROL ARM OF THE CAR COMPLETELY SNAPPING/ BREAKING CAUSED BY EROSION/CORROSION, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECALL IS FOR. CAR WAS TOWED AS WAS NOT DRIVABLE. THE TIRE CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AXLE WHEEL, AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CAR AND ENGINE AS DESCRIBED BY SMITH HAVEN MAZDA, WHERE CAR IS CURRENTLY BEING REPAIRED. HAD I BEEN TRAVELING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DEADLY MATTER AND MYSELF AND 4 CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  I AM SO UPSET THAT MAZDA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COMPLETELY STOP USING THESE CARS DUE TO THE DANGEROUS RISK OF DEATH/CRASH. I NO LONGER WANT TO BE AN OWNER OF THIS MAZDA AND WANT TO DITCH THIS CAR FOR FEAR OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY; UNACCEPTABLE SAFETY NOTIFICATION BY MAZDA. HAD MYSELF OR CHILDREN BEEN KILLED OR HURT, I WOULD BE SUING MAZDA. WILL MAZDA CONSIDER OFFERING ME ANY COMPENSATION ON TRADING/SELLING THIS CAR?",

WHEN I TRIED TO TAKE OFF WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, MY CAR HESITATED AND WHEN I PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDDLE A LITTLE MORE, IT STILL HESITATED THEN FINALLY TOOK OFF. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD AN EXTREMELY LOUD POPPING NOISE, AND THEN THICK, HEAVY WHITE SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE TAILPIPE. THE WHITE SMOKE THEN STARTED FLOWING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD, AND IT STARTED TO COME INTO THE CAR THROUGH THE AIR VENTS. WHEN I TRIED TO PULL OVER AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK, IT WOULDN'T SHIFT INTO GEAR, SO I PUSHED THE PARKING BREAK, AND IT FINALLY STOPPED. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WHEN I WENT TO GRAB MY PURSE, I SAW FIRE COMING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AIR VENTS ( THE ONES THAT BLOW AIR ON YOUR FEET) SO I GRABBED MY PURSE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD, AND RAN AWAY FROM THE CAR. THEN, I SAW PART OF THE ENGINE FALL OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, ON FIRE, AND BURN INTO THE STREET. ABOUT 5 SECONDS LATER, THE WHOLE ENTIRE CAR BURST INTO FLAMES. ALL OF THE DOORS WERE CLOSED, BUT THE INTENSITY OF THE FIRE BLEW BOTH OF THE PASSENGER SIDE DOORS OPEN, AND BLEW OUT ALL OF THE WINDOWS (INCLUDING THE SUNROOF, WHICH WAS CLOSED AT THE TIME). WHEN THE FIREFIGHTERS FINALLY PUT THE FIRE OUT, THE CAR WAS STILL SMOLDERING AND EVERYTHING INSIDE WAS MELTED. THE STEERING WHEEL, THE SEATS, THE DOOR HANDLES, THE MIRRORS, EVERYTHING. THE FIRE WAS SO STRONG THAT IT BLEW THE HOOD BACK ONTO THE WINDSHIELD. ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE CAR, IS JUST THE METAL FRAME, AND THE ENGINE. THE CAR HAS A 4 CYLINDER ENGINE WITH A TURBO FEATURE ON IT. I BELIEVE THAT  IS WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE AND MADE THE LOUD POPPING SOUND INITIALLY.  *TR",

TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE WARRANTY FOR THE PART WAS 60MONTHS/60,000 MILES. WHILE I WAS WAY UNDER ON THE MILES, I WAS 5 MONTHS OVER ON THE TIME. SINCE THIS WAS MY 3RD TRIP INTO THE DEALERSHIP OVER THE PAST 5 MONTHS DEALING WITH PROBLEMS/MAINTENANCE WITH MY CX-7, I ASKED WHY THIS PARTICULAR PART FAILED. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ETHANOL. AFTER SOME QUICK RESEARCH, IT IS CLEAR THAT 2007-2008 MAZDA CX-7 HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE EGR VALVE. IT WILL COST ME $650 TO FIX. MAZDA SHOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RECALL THIS PART SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE START. WAS TOLD THAT A NEW REPLACEMENT PART FOR THE EGR VALVE WOULD BE PUT INTO THE VEHICLE WHICH WILL NOT BREAK DUE TO PRESENCE OF ETHANOL IN GAS.  *TR",

I HAVE NO PROBLEMS PAYING FOR A PART, BUT THE VALVE COVER, BLOWER FAN, OR AC ITEMS SHOULDN'T BE BREAKING DOWN AT 19K ORIGINAL MILES.

MANY OTHER MAZDA OWNERS AND MECHANICS HAVE STATED THE TURBO CHARGING IN THE NEW MAZDA CX-7 HAS STARTED TO \"COOK\" THE OIL TOO FAST AND THIS CAUSES THE SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE, HOWEVER MAZDA WILL NOT OWN UP TO THIS DEFECT AND HONOR THE WARRANTY AND THIS VEHICLE.
