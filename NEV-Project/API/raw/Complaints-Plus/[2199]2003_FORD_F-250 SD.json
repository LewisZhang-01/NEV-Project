LONG TERM CONTACT RESULTED IN A .25 INCH WIDE X .5 INCH LONG FLAT AREA WORN INTO TUBE WALL WITH A PIN HOLE SIZE PENETRATION THRU THE TUBE WALL.  FLUID PRESSURE INSIDE THE TUBE IN COMBINATION WITH THE PIN HOLE SIZE PENETRATION RESULTED IN A SPRAYING LEAK FROM THE TUBE WHICH COATED THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE TRUCK AND THE TRAILER THAT WAS IN TOW AT THE TIME OF FAILURE.  THE BRAKING SURFACES ON ALL FOUR WHEELS OF THE TRUCK WERE COATED WITH TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THE LOW VOLUMETRIC FLOWRATE OF THE LEAK ALLOWED FOR CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE FOR SEVERAL HOURS (AT NIGHT ON FAIRLY LEVEL TERRAIN) WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF THE ONGOING LEAKAGE.  THIS ALLOWED FOR THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE VEHICLE INCLUDING THE BRAKING SURFACES TO BE COATED WITH FLUID.  THE LEAKAGE WAS IDENTIFIED WHEN THE TRANSMISSION TEMPERATURE GAUGE INDICATED HOT WHILE TRANSITIONING TETON PASS FROM JACKSON WYOMING.  INSPECTION OF THE TUBING INSTALLATION REVEALED THAT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE LEAKAGE WAS THE AFORE MENTIONED LONG TERM CONTACT WITH THE ENGINE SUPPORT FRAME CROSSMEMBER.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE IS EITHER DESIGN TOLERANCE FOR THE TUBING INSTALLATION OR INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF THE TUBING AT ORIGINAL ASSEMBLY.  THE CLAMPING PROVISION DESIGNED INTO THE TUBING INSTALLATION (ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE BLOCK ADJACENT TO THE OIL PAN) IN COMBINATION WITH THE INSUFFICIENT LENGTH OF THE TUBING SECTION CROSSING OVER THE ENGINE SUPPORT FRAME CROSSMEMBER RESULTED IN PRELOADED CONTACT BETWEEN THE TUBE AND THE FORWARD EDGE OF THE CROSSMEMBER.

HERE ARE THE ACTUAL FACTS:  IN JAN 06, THE FIRST TIRE, FRONT PASSENGER, FAILED WITH TREAD SEPARATED FROM TIRE WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.  DURING DEALER VEHICLE/TIRE DAMAGE INSPECTION, IT REVEALED THE OTHER FRONT TIRE SHOWED SIGNS OF TREAD SEPARATION.  UNDER WARRANTY, THE DEALER REPAIRED ALL BODY DAMAGE (OVER $3000.00) AND REPLACED THE TWO FAILED FRONT TIRES.  MY VEHICLE HAD 9600 MILES ON IT.  THE DEALER DID THE RIGHT THING.  ON 10-26-06 AT 1:33 PM THE 3RD \"GENERAL TIRE AMERITRAK\" TIRE TREAD ON MY 2003 F250 SUPERCAB SEPARATED, CAUSING OVER $3000.00 IN BODY DAMAGE & AT 16,194 MILES ON THE VEHICLE/TIRES.  ON 11-20-06, CONTINENTAL TIRE, NORTH CAROLINA, RECEIVED MY CLAIM (#6300003).  ON 11-27-06, CONTINENTAL TIRE RECEIVED THE FAILED TIRE.  ON 11-28-06, I E-MAILED AN INQUIRY TO CONTINENTAL.

MY VEHICLE REMAINS DAMAGED, AND IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT CONTINENTAL IS PERMITTED TO SELL DEFECTIVE \"GENERAL\" TIRES AND NOT EXPEDITIOUSLY SETTLE CLAIMS STEMMING FROM THOSE DEFECTIVE TIRE FAILURES. IT'S PAST TIME FOR CONTINENTAL TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND RESTORE MY VEHICLE BACK TO PRE-DAMAGE CONDITION.  SINCE TIRE TREAD SEPARATION HAS BEEN WELL-ESTABLISHED, HISTORICALLY, CONTINENTAL NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE AFTER-AFFECTS OF THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS .  THESE TIRES ARE DANGEROUS!!!  I WAS DRIVING ON BOTH OCCASIONS.  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  CONTINENTAL IS DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON SETTLING THE DAMAGES.  THESE TIRES SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET!

SECONDS LATER THERE WAS A LOUD THUD, AND ALL INDICATIONS OF A RIGHT REAR BLOWOUT.  I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL ONTO THE SHOULDER AND STOP.     INVESTIGATION REVEALED A RIGHT REAR TIRE FAILURE.

LATER INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE RIGHT REAR SHOCK MOUNT WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND THE SHOCK JAMMED CLOSED.

AFTER THIS TIRE ROTATION, I NOTICED A TENDENCY FOR THE STEERING WHEEL TO OSCILLATE WHEN I STEPPED ON THE BRAKES.  I ASSUMED IT WAS RELATED TO TIRES AND PLANNED TO REPLACE THEM ON MY RETURN.  I PICKED UP A 5TH WHEEL IN FLORIDA AND STARTED BACK ON NOVEMBER 2.  THE OSCILLATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS MUCH WORSE, SEEMINGLY AGGRAVATED BY THE CHANGE IN CG WITH THE TRAILER ATTACHED.  HARD BRAKING AT HIGH SPEEDS WORSENED THIS CONDITION BUT I WAS MOSTLY ABLE TO AVOID THIS SITUATION FOR THE TRIP HOME.  THE TRUCK ACTED COMPLETELY NORMAL WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED.    I REPLACED BOTH FRONT TIRES WITH NEW ONES. I INFORMED MY MECHANIC OF MY SYMPTOMS AND ASKED HIM TO REALIGN THE FRONT END IF HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING ELSE AMISS.   HE FOUND THE TIE ROD END THREADS WORN SO MUCH THAT THE ADJUSTING SLEEVE WOBBLED INSIDE IT EVEN THOUGH THE BOLTS WERE TIGHT.

I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE INABILITY TO NAVIGATE SAFELY THROUGH LANE CHANGES WITH THIS TRUCKS NARROW FIELD OF VIEW AND THE SMALL WIDE ANGLE MIRROR IS DISTRACTING AND USELESS.  THE BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE BED BOX IS NOT UNLIKE MY 1996 F250 SUPPER CAB TRUCK AND CAMPER, A TRUCK WITH VIRTUALLY THE SAME VISUAL IMPARITY AS THIS WORK TRUCK WITH THE STAHL SENTINEL COVERALL.    I HAVE NO SUCH CONCERNS WITH MY OWN TRUCK IT HAS A SINGLE WIDE ANGLE MIRROR (CONVEX) THAT I HAVE HAD ON TWO FORD TRUCKS SENSE 1980.  THE REASON THIS 2003 TRUCK CONCERNS ME IS THAT THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE STAHL SENTINEL COVERALL IS COMPOUNDED 80% MORE BY FORDS 2003 EXTENDABLE MIRROR WITH SUCH A NARROW FIELD OF VIEW ON THE UPPER MIRROR AND A HARD TO FOCUS DISTRACTING LOWER MIRROR.      I FIND THIS MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VERY DISAPPOINTING, DISTRACTING, A LIMITED VIEW AND EVEN CONFUSING ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING LANE CHANGES.    WHEN THE MIRROR IS ADJUSTED OUT TO SEE THE ADJACENT LANE YOU FIND THAT IT IS VERY DISORIENTING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THE RIGHT EDGE OF YOUR TRUCK SO IT IS HARD TO TRUST WHAT THE MIRROR IS SHOWING YOU! HELL YOU COULD BE SEEING TWO LANES OVER!    AGAIN I THINK THE SOLUTION IS:  FORD SHOULD OFFER AN OPTION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE TOP MIRROR WITH A WIDE ANGLE MIRROR (CONVEX).    I WOULD THINK THAT FORD WOULD WANT TO INVESTIGATE THIS SAFETY ISSUE FURTHER.  AFTER ALL 20 YEARS AGO THE CONVEX PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR WAS INTRODUCED FOR THAT REASON AND THE COMPLAINTS WEREN\u0019T ABOUT COVERAGE BUT ABOUT JUDGING DISTANCES.  SO WHEN INNOCENT FAMILIES GET SIDE SWIPED GOING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED YOU GOING TO BLAME THE DRIVER EVEN THOUGH FORD HAS INTRODUCED A FAULTY MIRROR DESIGN JUST TO MAKE THE RANCHERS HAPPY PULLING AND BACKING UP THERE HAY WAGONS!!

THIS WAS THE FIRST DIESEL VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED SO IN THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT IT WAS NORMAL, BUT IT KEPT GETTING WORSE. I PURCHASED THE TRUCK IN APRIL 2003. I HAVE HAD HARD SHIFTING SINCE I BOUGHT IT. WHEN I BACK THE TRUCK UP AND THEN SHIFT INTO DRIVE IT WILL SLAM INTO GEAR AS A VEHICLE WITH NO TRANSMISSION FLUID REACTS. THERE WAS A DANGEROUS HESITATION WHEN CROSSING TRAFFIC AND SOMETIMES THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE A 3-5 SECOND STALL. IT HAS BLOWN WHITE SMOKE MORE RECENTLY AND WOULD NOT KICK DOWN INTO PASSING GEAR ON THE FREEWAY. I HAVE HAD THE TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES AND THE LAST TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NO FIX AT THAT TIME. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER AND SHE TELLS ME THAT THE FIX WILL RAISE THE NOISE LEVEL UP 5 DECIBELS. THIS WILL MAKE THE TRUCK LOUDER THAN IT WAS WHEN IT WAS SOLD TO ME. I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK BECAUSE OF THE POWER AND HOW QUIET IT WAS. NOW IT WILL GET LOUDER? I REQUESTED THAT FORD BUY THE VEHICLE BACK AND THEY WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM FIRST! EVEN THOUGH IT WILL BE LOUDER. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE. I HAVE MY RECEIPTS BUT DIDN'T FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE REPAIRS HAVE COST ALL TOGETHER, BUT FORD HAS NOT CHARGED ME ANYTHING...

FOUR DAYS LATER WE WERE ABLE TO PICK UP THE \"REPAIRED\" TRUCK. FIVE DAYS LATER THE LIGHT IS BACK ON AGAIN AND NOW IT IS ALSO RUNNING ROUGH, SLOW ACCELERATION, STALLING, SLOW RESPONSE FROM A STOP, ETC.

THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT FROM THE SLOW ACCELERATION AND STALLING. THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET UNTIL THEY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.
