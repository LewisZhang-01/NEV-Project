ISSUE ACTUALLY IS THE WAY TRAILER AXLE HANGERS WERE WELDED TO FRAME AFTER TALKING TO AXLE SUPPLIER AND DISCOVERED AFTER THREE PRIVATE COMPANY INSPECTIONS. TRAILER WAS TAKEN BACK TO FACTORY ON DECEMBER 27TH 2018, HOWEVER MANUFACTURE DOESN'T CARE TO REPAIR STATES THEY DON'T SEE ISSUES I'M SPEAKING ABOUT WHEN POLICE EVEN SAW SOME OF WHAT MY CONCERNS WERE. POLICE REPORT AS WELL AS STATE INSPECTION AND SALES INVOICE IS IN WRITING AND CAN ALSO BE OBTAINED IF NEEDED. OTHER ORIGINAL FENDER IS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRESS CRACKING AND WELDS ON TRAILER ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW EXTREME STRESS RELATED TO IMPROPER AXLE INSTALL. I CONTACT CEO OF LOOK TRAILERS ABOUT MY CONCERNS, WAITING FOR A RESPONSE.",
