I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND STARTED IT UP AGAIN.  APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES LATER, AS I EXITED THE RAMP IN DELTONA, THE CAR DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ASKED WHY THE CAR HAD NEVER DONE THIS UNTIL THE RECALL FOR THE KEY ISSUE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND I WAS TOLD TO COME BACK AND THEY WOULD DO A DIAGNOSTIC.  I DROVE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC &  BASED ON THE SYMPTOMS DETERMINED IT WAS THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THEY ALSO PURGED THE SOLENOID, COSTING $366.

I WAS IN THE PASSING LANE WITH EASY ACCESS TO THE EMERGENCY LANE, AND ONCE AGAIN THE CAR STARTED UP AND I CONTINUED ON MY WAY AND BACK HOME.  I DROVE IN THE RIGHT LANE THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP DOWN AND BACK SO I COULD BAIL OUT IF NEEDED.   ON THE DAY OF THE ORIGINAL REPAIR, AFTER THE CAR SHUT DOWN TWICE ON THE WAY HOME, I CHECKED THE GOVERNMENT RECALL PAGE TO SEE IF THERE WERE OTHER RECALL ISSUES AND I LEARNED THAT THE FOB IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE ATTACHED TO THE KEY.

I WOULD LIKE GM TO AT LEAST PAY THIS AMOUNT.  THERE IS A GM 14350 RECALL ON THIS CAR.  IN TALKING TO GM THEY WOULD ONLY CONSIDER PAYING FOR THIS, IF THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY ROTATION OF THE IGNITION KEY  I AM A MAN 71 YEARS OLD AND HAVE OWNED MANY CARS, MOST PURCHASED NEW.  I KEEP MOST CARS 10 YEARS AND OVER 100,000 MILES.  I HAVE NEVER REPLACED AND IGNITION SWITCH UNTIL NOW.  THIS PROBLEM TOOK ABOUT 3 MONTHS TO DIAGNOSE. THE INITIAL PROBLEM DEVELOPED WHEN THE CRUISE CONTROL TURNED OFF WHILE IN USE.  IT WAS VERY INTERMITTENT AND NOT PREDICTABLE.  THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LITE CAME ON.  THE CODES INDICATE A PROBLEM WITH THE OIL PRESSURE SENDING UNIT AND THE CRUISE CONTROL.  THE NEXT TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME, THERE WERE NO CODES.  THE NEXT SET OF PROBLEMS WAS THE POWER WINDOW, VENTILATION (AC AND FAN), AND RADIO WOULD NOT WORK.  THE MAIN INDICATOR OF THIS PROBLEM WAS THE FUEL AND TEMPERATURE GAUGES WOULD NOT WORK.  I WOULD GET VARIOUS WARNING LIGHTS AFTER STARTING THE ENGINE INCLUDING ABS, BATTERY AND OTHERS.  THE PROBLEMS GOT WORSE AS THE TEMPERATURE GOT HOTTER.    HALF WAY BETWEEN MILWAUKEE AND APPLETON, 100 MILES INTO A 200MILE TRIP, WE STOPPED AT A REST STOP.   UPON RETURNING TO THE CAR, I COULDN?T GET THE FAN OR WINDOWS TO WORK OR ELIMINATE THE BATTERY WARNING LIGHT.  FORTUNATELY, THE BACK WINDOWS WERE OPEN AND INCH WHEN WE LEFT THE REST STOP.  ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER LEAVING THE REST STOP, EVERYTHING CAME ON.   THE CAR BECAME UNUSABLE BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS.  TAKING IT TO AND INDEPENDENT SHOP THE OWNER WAS VERY PATIENT AS DAY AFTER DAY, NOTHING WOULD FAIL.  FINALLY ON A HOT SUNNY DAY WITH THE CAR IN THE SUN, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO FAIL.   REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH FIXED ALL THESE PROBLEMS.  *TR",

LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE CAR TO THE SAFE LOCATION QUICKLY OUT OF TRAFFIC, BEFORE THE STEERING POWER WAS LOST. THERE WERE MANY CLOSE CALLS! AFTER POWERING OFF, HAD TO PRAY IT WOULD START AGAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WOULD NOT. TOOK TO FIRESTONE, THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE IT. SO I TOOK TO THE CHEVY DEALER. IT WAS ORIGINALLY DIAGNOSED AS THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH I PAID TO HAVE REPLACED. A WEEK LATER I STILL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I WENT ONLINE TO SEVERAL BLOGS/WEBSITES AND REALIZED THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE MALIBU. SOME PEOPLE ONLINE RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH, BASED ON THE SYMPTOMS. I TOOK THE CAR TO DEALER AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK MY IGNITION SWITCH, AS IT APPEARED ONLINE TO BE LONG STANDING ISSUE WHICH WAS NEVER RECALLED. THE DEALER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS THE IGNITION SWITCH, A KNOWN ISSUE FOR CHEVY AND AT THAT TIME I HAD MY CAR REPAIRED. QUITE EXPENSIVE AND DANGEROUS FOR DRIVING. HOWEVER, I NOTICED THE 2003 MALIBU IS NOT LISTED ON THE CURRENT RECALLS. MANY OWNERS WOULD AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE.  *TR",

MY MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO ELIMINATE TO CHECK ENGINE/SERVICE ENGINE DISPLAYS WITH REQUIRED MAINTENANCE. HOWEVER, THE DASH DISPLAY AND POWER LOSS CONTINUED?

I BASICALLY GAVE UP COMPLAINING TO THE DEALER AND WENT BACK TO THE 10 MINUTE RESET PROCEDURE. A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.    MY SON ASKED WHY THE CAR WAS NEVER FIXED.

MY MECHANIC PERFORMED THE TEST ON THE ACCELERATOR AND BRAKE ASSEMBLY AND IT FAILED.  THE ACCELERATOR WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE ENGINE IDLE POSITION WHEN MY FOOT WAS OFF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL- IT WOULD GO 35 MILES PER HOUR WITHOUT MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR- VERY DANGEROUS. MY MECHANIC REPLACE THE ACCELERATOR AND BRAKE ASSEMBLY, AND GAVE ME THE PART. THEY SUGGESTED I PURSUE THROUGH GM. I DID SO, CASE #71-827370783. I RECEIVED A CALL TODAY FROM GM STATING THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIR SINCE IT WASN'T PART OF THE RECALL, REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE ITEM, NOT A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM, AND FURTHER, VERY DANGEROUS.  I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A NEW RECALL FOR THE REST OF THE 2003 CHEVY MALIBUS THAT WERE NOT ON THE ORIGINAL LIST- THEY OBVIOUSLY MISSED SOME VEHICLES THAT WERE AFFECTED.

FINALLY, MY WIFE WAS RECENTLY STRANDED BECAUSE THE FUEL PUMP FAILED...REPAIR COST $1,000.  ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS OCCURRED WITHIN THE PAST 6 MONTHS.

WILL IT TAKE SOMEONE BEING INJURED FROM A SECOND- HAND INCIDENT AS A RESULT OF 'EQUIPMENT FAILURE' TO MAKE GM NOTICE? THERE WAS NO PRIOR WARNING WITH THIS 'SHUTDOWN' OF THE CAR.  AS A MOTHER, I CANNOT LET MY CHILDREN TAKE THIS CAR ON THE HIGHWAY.  IN GOOD FAITH I PURCHASED THIS CAR, EXPECTING A RELIABLE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.

I  KNOW THAT OTHER CAR OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE.   I ALSO BELIEVE THAT GM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THIS ISSUE SINCE IT IS A \"KNOWN\" ISSUE.

THE MECHANIC RESET THE THING BUT AFTER CRANKING THE CAR 4 TIMES, THE PROBLEM RECURRED. MECHANIC SAID COMPUTER WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF ABOUT $500. AT JUST OVER 41,000 MILES, THE WARRANTY IS NO GOOD ON MY CAR ANYMORE. HOWEVER, I TOLD THE SERVICE MEN AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR MONTHS AGO THAT THE DOORS WERE LOCKING BY THEMSELVES AFTER I'D EXITED THE CAR AND WALKED ABOUT 12 FEET AWAY. TOLD THEM THAT IT HAD HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES AND ASKED IF THEY'D HAD ANY OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. HE JUST LOOKED AT ME, LAUGHED AND SAID THAT HE'D NOT HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. IF A SHORT IN THE BODY COMPUTER IS CAUSING THE ANTI THEFT TO ACTIVATE SO THE CAR WON'T START, THEN IT SEEMS LIKELY TO ME THAT THE SAME SHORT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSING MY DOORS TO LOCK. INSTEAD OF CHECKING THAT PROBLEM OUT AT THE DEALER WHEN I FIRST TOLD THEM ABOUT IT,AND MY WARRANTY WAS STILL GOOD, THE SERVICE MAN JUST TOLD ME THAT I WAS PROBABLY HITTING THE BUTTON ON MY REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY. I DON'T EVEN HAVE KEYLESS ENTRY ON MY CAR AND I TOLD HIM THAT. STILL ALL I GOT THEN WAS A LAUGH AND A SHOULDER SHRUG. IF THE PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR LOCKS HAD OF BEEN CHECKED OUT, THEN THE PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING NOW MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DETECTED WHILE MY WARRANTY WAS STILL GOOD.

THERE IS AN EPIDEMIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CARS DRIVING WITH ONLY ONE HEADLIGHT BECAUSE OF POOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING/MANUFACTURING OF THAT SYSTEM IN AMERICAN MADE CARS.  I DO NOT SEE THAT PROBLEM WITH FOREIGN MADE CARS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IN 2003 AMERICAN CAR MANUFACTURERS CANNOT BUILD A CAR WHERE HEADLIGHTS WILL NOT FAIL -- AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FAILURES CAUSED BY ACCIDENTS OR IMPACTS.  IN OHIO IT WAS REALLY BAD, AND AS I MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT ISOLATED AT ALL, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF HEADLIGHT FAILURES IN AMERICAN CARS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE OR YEAR.  THIS IS A WIDE-SPREAD PROBLEM THAT CAN BE TRACED TO AMERICAN CAR MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING PROBLEMS.  HEADLIGHTS ARE A MAJOR SAFETY ITEM IN A CAR, AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE FAILING AT SUCH AN ALARMING RATE.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NO-ONE HAS TAKEN ACTION TO DATE REGARDING THIS OBVIOUS ISSUE.   *NLM",
