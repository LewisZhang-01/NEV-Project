        "summary": "On Feb 26, 2022;  my wife and I were driving down a Hwy in SW Georgia at approximately 60 mph and our 2020 Nissan Murano Sunroof literally exploded.  The roof was fully closed at the time and the sun shade was also closed.  It was like a shot gun blast.  Was a good thing I was driving, had my wife been driving I suspect she would have reacted in a manner that would have wrecked us.  We were both shook up.  Hearing wind blowing into car, I slightly opened the sun shade and could tell the center portion of the sun roof had blown out and shivers of glass came down onto us, I closed the shade and pulled over at next available opportunity.   At the time the sun roof exploded, there were no other vehicles within approx 1/4 mile in front of us, we had not just passed any vehicle, there were no overpasses, and nothing we recall to have hit the roof.   At the time, We were traveling out of our home town,  a significant way from home;  as soon as I stopped, I took Photos of the roof from the exterior above the shattered sunroof with the center section blown out.  I was able to purchase a heavy duct tape and tapped the shattered sunroof from the top, with several layers of tap to secure the remaining shattered glass/sun roof.  We were able to travel on home.   I immediately contacted the dealership (Greenway Nissan Brunswick Ga) were we had purchased the 2020 Nissan Murano vehicle and explained what happened.  I was told they had never heard of that happening.  We had purchased the Platnum Extended warranty with our New Murano.  I scheduled an appointment and took my vehicle to the Greenway dealership on Mar 8, 2022; and the sun roof was replaced under warranted, and my vehicle was returned to me on Mar 10, 2022 with a new Sun Roof (ref: Greenway Invoice 48890). The sun shade had a scratch approximately 18\u201d, but was not replaced because the adjuster could not determine it was caused by the roof explosion, which I don\u2019t see how it could not have been.",

I went to the Dealership on 4/13/2021 to get the oil changed and tires rotated on my 2015 Nissan Murano Platinum. My existing vehicle was in perfect mechanical condition, and while I was awaiting the completion of my oil change, a Sales Person came up and began to chat with me, and told me I needed to buy a new car, and said my car would be junk in no time, and I needed to get rid of it before it was literally worth nothing. This Man did not relent all day long. I finally caved and bought the 2020 Murano against my better judgement, and I had no idea it had a recall issued on it, but they did! About 2 months later, I get a call from the Dealership inviting me in for a free oil change and Tire rotation on the new purchase. I declined, because I was ultimately not satisfied with the Salespersons behavior post-purchase. He continued to text me and ask me out to dinner, dancing, etc. until I finally blocked his phone number. So, I had no intention on getting anything further from THAT Nissan Dealership. The Person on the phone mentioned that they really needed to get the car in there because they really should not have sold it to me with an open recall, and they needed to get that fixed. I still declined, and did some research, only to find that it's a pretty major SAFETY recall, that could affect the steering loss. I also discovered that Federal Law 49 U.S. Code \u00a7 30116 \u2013 Defects and noncompliance found before sale to purchaser, prohibits the sale of a new vehicle with an open safety recall!!!  I contacted Nissan, and they opened case# 45574832, about the sales experience, but stated the Dealership is independent of them, and I would need to remedy the situation directly with them. I attempted to do so numerous times, to no avail. They have continually publicly denying my requests, blocking my reviews about the Dealership and I am now at this point.",

ON MY WAY DOWN, WHEN THE SUN WAS OVERHEAD, THE REAR \"LIP\" OF THE HOOD ACTED JUST LIKE A MIRROR AND REFLECTED THE SUN RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS EYES.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOOD, IT SLANTS UP LIKE A NORMAL HOOD, THEN THE LAST 3 INCHES ARE TILTED DOWN TOWARD THE COWL/WINDSHIELD WIPER AREA.  I AM ATTACHING A PICTURE, HOWEVER IT DOES NOT ACCURATELY SHOW HOW BRIGHT THIS REFLECTION IS.  IT IS EXACTLY LIKE SOMEBODY TAKING A MIRROR AND SHINING IT IN YOUR EYES.  I PARTICIPATE IN THE NISSAN EMPLOYEE LEASE PROGRAM AND TOOK IT BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATOR AND THEY SAID THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT; THAT IT WAS A DESIGN ISSUE.  THIS SITUATION ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE SUN IS HIGH IN THE SKY BUT IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN IT REFLECTS IN YOUR EYES.  BELOW ASKS FOR A SPECIFIC DATE BUT IT HAPPENS ANY TIME THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT.",
