        "summary": "THIS IS ON A 2003 SAAB 9-3 2.0T LINEAR MODEL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES THIS TIME BUT THE POTENTIAL IS VERY MUCH THERE.     MY WIFE WAS PULLING OUT FROM A STOP LIGHT AND HEAR A LOUD POP FOLLOWED BY A LOUD GRINDING NOISE. SHE PULLED OFF IMMEDIATELY. WHEN I ARRIVED ON SCENE, I FOUND THAT THE DRIVERS FRONT WHEEL WAS PUSHED UP INTO THE WHEEL WELL. WHEN I REMOVED THE TIRE I FOUND THAT THE SPRING HAD BROKEN IN TWO (THE BOTTOM  LAST RING BROKE OFF) AND HAD DROPPED DOWN TO WHERE THE JAGGED END (STILL ATTACHED/WRAPPED AROUND THE SHOCK) WAS POKING INTO THE TIRE. IT HAD LEFT A RELATIVELY DEEP GOUGE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE TIRE.    I AM SURE I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF THE SPRING WERE TO BREAK ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70MPH AND PUNCTURE THE TIRE. I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT IF MY WIFE WOULD HAVE KEPT DRIVING ANY DISTANCE THAT THE SPRING WOULD HAVE DUG ITS WAY THROUGH THE SIDE WALL AND PUNCTURED IT. REMEMBER, WE CANT ALWAYS JUST PULL OFF THE INTERSTATE OR STOP AT THE DROP OF A HAT. IF YOU HAVE EVER DRIVEN THROUGH ATLANTA YOU WILL KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE ;)    ANYWAY, WENT DIGGING ON THE INTERNET TRYING TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SPRINGS AND FOUND OUT THAT SAAB HAD ISSUED A SPECIAL WARRANTY FOR SPRING FAILURES ON SOME OF THE 9-3'S (INCLUDING MINE). APPARENTLY,SAAB IS AWARE THAT ROAD DEBRIS CAN GET JAMMED IN THE SPRING MOUNT AND EAT AT THE COATING AWAY ON THE BOTTOM COIL AND ALLOW CORROSION TO WORK ITS MAGIC RESULTING IN THE SPRINGS BREAKING/FAILING.    SO, I CALL SAAB. THEY TELL ME THAT I AM NOT COVERED BECAUSE I DO NOT LIVE IN WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE SNOW BELT. WHICH IS THE UPPER/MORE NORTHERN STATES. THEY TELL ME THAT THE FAILURE HAS BEEN REPORTED MORE IN THESE STATES AND IT IS DUE TO ROAD SALTING. FURTHERMORE, I AM TOLD THAT THEY ARE ONLY REPLACING THE SPRINGS AFTER THEY HAVE FAILED.     AS THESE CARS START TO GET SOME AGE ON THEM, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO START SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THESE FAILURES. WILL IT TAKE SOMEONE DYING FOR THEM TO ISSUE A RECALL CAMPAIGN? *TR",

ON RETURNING FROM A 2 WEEK VACATION I STARTED THE CAR IN THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT AND HEARD A CLICKING / RUBBING NOISE FROM THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL.  I STOPPED AND INSPECTED THE WHEEL AND NOTED RUST ON THE BRAKE ROTOR AND ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE AND WOULD WEAR OFF WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  DROVE ~1/4 MILE AND STOPPED AT A LIGHT BEFORE TURNING ON TO THE INTERSTATE WHEN I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE WHEEL.  CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE FRONT LEFT SUSPENSION COIL SPRING HAD FAILED AND THE FRACTURED SPRING WAS RUBBING ON THE TIRE.   THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE SAAB DEALER WHERE THE FRONT SPRINGS WERE REPLACED AND THE DAMAGED TIRE REPLACED.  I HAVE THE FAILED SPRING HARDWARE.    DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR FAILURES OF THE FRONT SPRING ON SAAB 9-3S, SAAB REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE AND CHARGED ME FOR THE REPAIR.

ORIGINALLY, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE NOISE WAS DUE TO A WHEEL OR BRAKE ISSUE, SO WE DROVE THE CAR FOR QUITE SOME TIME THINKING IT WAS JUST A MINOR ANNOYANCE, NOT A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK (SOME DRIVERS HAVE HAD THE SPRING SHOOT OUT AND SHRED THEIR TIRES WHILE DRIVING!).  WE GOT THE TIRES / WHEELS BALANCED, ROTATED AND ALSO REPLACED THE BRAKES, NONE OF WHICH HELPED THE PROBLEM.      THEN ANOTHER MECHANIC CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM DURING AN OIL CHANGE WHEN THEY FOUND THE BROKEN OFF PIECE OF SPRING WHICH WAS CAUSING THE RATTLE.  THE BROKEN OFF PIECE HAS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF RUST THE LAST 1' OR SO WHERE THE BREAK OCCURRED.  THERE IS A RUBBER SHEATH THAT PARTIALLY COVERS THAT SECTION OF THE SPRING, BUT IT IS OBVIOUSLY FLAWED IN KEEPING WATER FROM CORRODING THE SPRING AS THERE IS A LOT OF RUST ALL THROUGHOUT.

THE DEALERSHIP CALLED THIS \"LIMP HOME MODE\" THEY SAID IT WAS SIMILAR TO A WINDOWS \"SAFE MODE\". AS YOU COULD IMAGINE I WAS ANGRY BUT UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES UNEXPLAINABLE THINGS HAPPEN.
