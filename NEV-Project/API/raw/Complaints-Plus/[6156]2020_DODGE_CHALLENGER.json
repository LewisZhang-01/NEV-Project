The air bag did not deploy, even though I could smell it, as if it did deploy. Also, my car app notified me that the airbag had been deployed and needed to be taken to a service provider to be serviced. The problem is that no airbags actually deployed. So if I had been in a situation that required the airbags to save my life, I would not have had them. I feel like this could really be a problem if it happened in another situation & I wanted to let someone know so they can look into it.",
