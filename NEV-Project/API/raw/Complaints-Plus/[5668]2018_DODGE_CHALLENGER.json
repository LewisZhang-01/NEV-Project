This morning while waiting for the car to warm up so the heat would function on the climate control system, I used the display to set the defrost to on. After removing the initial frost from my windshield and I was able to see clearly, I left the house and headed to work.   While on my way to work I begun to hear confirmation beeps from my display, as if I was touching the onscreen controls. The touchscreen display began to change settings on its own. Changing my climate controls from High heat to low Cold resulting in my windshield immediately frosting up and reducing my visibility to nothing, during morning traffic. I nearly impacted another vehicle that was turning while distracted by the display and the lack of visibility it caused. I rolled down the windows and found a safe place to pull over to wipe the frost from my windshield. The entire time the display was switching thru pages and begun to call contacts from my phone change songs, and even the performance level settings.    I had taken the vehicle to the dealership far prior to my warranty expiring when I initially noticed the bubble at the top of my screen, only to be told that since it was a cosmetic defect and the operation was normal that the warranty would not cover the replacement. and a replacement was $2,200.  Now my vehicle warranty is expired and it has changed from a cosmetic defect to a defect that has affected the safe operation and nearly caused me to rear end another vehicle at 55 MPH.   From the research I have gathered during my lunch break the display in these units operates too hot and the glue bonding the touch panel to the display itself has melted and caused the separation. It seems to be a common issue that affects any vehicle with a 8.4 uConnect display, judging by complaints on the forums.  This is not only a distraction but a Major safety hazard.",
