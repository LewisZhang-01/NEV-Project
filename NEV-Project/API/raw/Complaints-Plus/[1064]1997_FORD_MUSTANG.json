HOWEVER, ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER, THE CAR BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN AS IF THE CONTROL WAS DISENGAGED.  AFTER I REALIZED THIS, I PUMPED THE BRAKES TO DISENGAGE THE C/C.  IT TOOK SEVERAL ATTEMPTS OF PUMPING THE BRAKES TO RELEASE CONTROL.  ONCE DONE, I WAS TOO PARANOID TO TRY USING THE C/C UNTIL RECENTLY.  I DECIDED TO TRY IT WITH NO TRAFFIC AROUND IN A 35 MPH ZONE ON A STRAIGHT AWAY.  THE CRUISE CONTROL SIMPLY WOULD NOT ENGAGE.  I TOOK IT TO AN ASE CERTIFIED SHOP IN ELLSWORTH, MAINE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED.  THE SHOP SAID IT WAS A RELAY THAT WAS BURNED OUT.  THE RELAY WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF 48 DOLLARS FOR PARTS AND LABOR.  AFTER REPLACING THE RELAY, THE C/C STILL DOES NOT WORK.    I AM MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SUDDEN SLOW DOWN AND NON-RELEASE OF SPEED CONTROL TO THE DRIVER THAN WITH GETTING MY C/C TO WORK AGAIN, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS.  ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAPPENED ON A MAINE HIGHWAY IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.  THANK YOU.*AK",

ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I HAVE A VERY INCONVENIENT AND COSTLY PROBLEM THAT I FEEL FORD SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR.  *LA",

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH .

THE PROBLEM IS SO COMMON THAT AFTERMARKET SUPPLIERS CARRY A PLUG AND PIGTAIL FOR THESE VEHICLES.  HERE WE HAVE A 1997 MUSTANG GT, WHILE DRIVING WITH THE FOG LIGHTS ON THE WIRING AT THE HEADLAMP SWITCH OVERHEATED , MELTING THE PLUG TO THE HEADLAMP SWITCH. ALSO I NOTICED BURN RESIDUE ON THE  SWITCH ITSELF.   BEING AWARE OF THE PRIOR PROBLEMS WITH THE OLDER CARS I KNEW TO SUT THE FOG LIGHTS OFF. THIS IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE GAUGE CLUSTER LIGHTS BACK ON. I TURNED THE HEADLAMP SWITCH OFF AND THE SMOKE BEGAN TO CLEAR.  THIS IS A VERY POPULAR CAR WITH A PROBLEM THAT I AM FINDING IS FAR MORE COMMON ON THE SN95 MODEL MUSTANG THAN THOUGHT. I WAS SUPRISED THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER NHTSA COMPLAINT REGARDING THE VEH. I CALLED AND CHECKED. MY FRIENDS 1995 DID THE SAME THING WITH LESS THAN 36 THOUSAND MILES ON IT AND FORD REPAIRED IT AT NO COST. I HAVE EMAILED WEB SITES ASKING ANY OTHER OWNERS TO FILE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH NHTSA AND FORD SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN BE NOTIFIED. IF NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN AT LEAST TO HAVE PEOPLE NOTIFIED NOT TO USE THE FOG LIGHTS UNTIL THIER CAR CAN BE INSPECTED. IT IS A COUPLE OF SCREWS AND THE REMOVAL OF THE HEADLAMP KNOB TO INSPECT THE SWITCH AND THE WIRING.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL MY FRIEND BOBBY SILVA AT 480-961-7433. HE IS ALSO AN OWNER AND WORKS FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HE WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD ME WHAT TO DO WHEN MY CAR STARTED SMOKING AND HE KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM.

ORIGINALLY, THE DEALERSHIP FOUND THE DEFECT AND REPRESENTED TO ME THAT THE BODY SHOP WOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THE DEFECT. AT THAT TIME, I WAS TOLD THE REAR TIRES WERE POINTING TO THE RIGHT. NOW I AM BEING TOLD BY EVERYONE OTHER THAN THE DEALERSHIP THAT THEY ARE \"TOED TO THE LEFT - NO ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE\". AT THE TIME THE DEALERSHIP PUT THE CAR IN THE BODY SHOP FOR \"RE-WELDING\"  IT HAD ONLY 20628 MILES ON IT, AND THE TIRES WERE COMPLETELY RUINED. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO MAKE ANY ALLOWANCES FOR NEW TIRES. AT THAT TIME, THE CAR WOULD FISHTAIL AND SWERVE ON RIGHT TURNS, EVEN FROM  A DEAD STOP. I INFORMED THE DEALERSHIP THAT NOW THE CAR DOES THE SAME THING ON LEFT TURNS. I HAVE HAD THEM LOOK AT THE VEHICLE THREE TIMES IN THE LAST MONTH, AND THEIR CONSISTENT POSITION IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. THE MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSE WAS THAT I NEEDED TO GO THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP. I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW AND PAID FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH HAD NOT EXPIRED AT THE TIME I BROUGHT THIS BACK TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALERSHIP AND THE MANUFACTURER. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. I DO NOT FEEL THAT MATTERS, HOWEVER, AS THE DEFECT HERE IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION WHICH I HAVE, IS NON-REPAIRABLE. I HAVE PROVIDED THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE COMPUTER PRINTOUTS WHICH I HAVE FROM OTHER TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM, BUT, AS I SAID, THEIR CONSISTENT POSITION IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR.
