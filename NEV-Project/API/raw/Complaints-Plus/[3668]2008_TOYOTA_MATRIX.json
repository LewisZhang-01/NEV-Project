PUTTING IT IN NEUTRAL WAS NOT AN OPTION WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN TRAFFIC AT A LIGHT. I COULD EITHER REAR END THE CAR AHEAD OF ME OR GET REAR ENDED BY THE CAR BEHIND ME. I HAD TO STOP THE CAR BY PUTTING IT IN PARK.  THE CAR \"BUCKED.\" IT STOPPED THE CAR AND FOR THAT I WAS GRATEFUL BECAUSE IT JUST KEPT MOVING. I WAS ON A CELL PHONE CALL WHEN IT HAPPENED ANOTHER TIME GOING INTO A GARAGE.  THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP AGAIN.  MY FRIEND COULD HEAR THE ACCELERATION OF THE CAR THROUGH THE CELL PHONE.  I COULDN'T STOP THE CAR WITH MY BRAKE.  AGAIN I HAD TO PUT IT INTO PARK AND IT BUCKED AGAIN.  I REPORTED IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP ON 12/9/09.  I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER AFTER THAT DATE AND HE TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK AND I DID ON 2/19/10. THE PEDAL WAS REPLACED ON 3/4/10 AND ON WEEK OF 3/8/10 I EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE OF THE CAR NOT STOPPING AND THE ACCELERATOR STICKING 3 TIMES IN ONE WEEK.  THAT'S AFTER THE PEDAL WAS REPLACED.  THE DEALERSHIP CHECKED MY CAR OUT ON EACH OCCASION. I HAVE DOCUMENTATION FOR ALL THESE VISITS AND OPENED IT LOOKS LIKE 2 ACCOUNTS WITH TOYOTA OF AMERICA #[XXX] AND #[XXX].  THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG EVEN AFTER DRIVING THE CAR FOR 4 MILES.  THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND DRIVING 4 MILES IS LUDICROUS IN ORDER TO SEE IF THEY CAN EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE TOLD ME THEY HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC WORKUPS ON THE CAR.  THEY WILL NOT CHECK THE COMPUTER OR ELECTRONICS AS THEY SAY IT IS NOT THE PROBLEM.  HELP.  I AM IN TRAFFIC EVERYDAY.  I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE FAILURE WILL POP UP ON ME.  I NOW HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS CAR AND I CAN'T SELL IT TO SOMEONE PRIVATELY AS I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING HAPPENING TO THAT PERSON.  PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU. *TR",
