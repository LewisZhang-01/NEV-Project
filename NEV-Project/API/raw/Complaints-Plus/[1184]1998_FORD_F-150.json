Rear trailer wiring plug when it's connected causes multiple lights to stay on even though vehicle not running and everything off.  Also melted all wires on 2 trailers causing shorted out lights, replaced clutch 2 times since purchase on 3rd clutch and mechanics not sure why even after showing them I am properly using the clutch system, not pulling heavy loads, or driving it like a race truck.  ABS system light won't shut off even though no codes or problems with abs system, multiple vacuum leaks and can't get rid of running lean and bad O2 sensors even after replacing them all.",

THEY WERE SOLD AS NEW TIRES AND THE WARRANTY ONLY HAD 3 YEARS ON IT. MANDAN WALMART SAID THEY DO NOT FIX FLATS WITH ROT AND THAT DID NOT SELL THE TIRES, THE THIRD PARTY DID.

THE FRAME X-MEMBER WAS NOT ADDRESSED AND THE NEW GAS TANK BEGAN TO LEAK WITHIN A YEAR AND A HALF OF REPLACEMENT.   THE ENGINE WAS JUST RECENTLY TUNED UP BY A FORD DEALER BECAUSE IT WAS INTERMITTENTLY VIBRATING.  WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF THIS TUNE UP, THE ENGINE LOST FULL POWER WITH FINDING OF GROSSLY CONTAMINATED FUEL.  THE 2 YEAR OLD TANK WAS PULLED AND THE TOP OF THE TANK WAS REVEALED TO BE METALLIC SWISS CHEESE EQUIVALENT,  THIS TIME WITH NUMEROUS VERY LARGE HOLES THAT RAIN WAS EASILY PENETRATING INTO THE TANK VIA THE CAB-BED SPACE OPENING.  THE X-MEMBER FRAME SUPPORT WAS CORRODED IN HALF.  THE DEALER COULD NOT FIX IT AND I PAID FOR A SECOND NEW TANK AND FUEL PUMP($350 WITH SHIPPING TO HI), POR 15 COATED THE TOP OF THE NEW TANK MYSELF, AND PAID A LOCAL BODY SHOP$1042.00 TO PULL THE X-MEMBER AND REPLACE IT WITH A USED PART AS FORD NO LONGER STOCKS (LIKELY RUSTED TO BITS IN THEIR WAREHOUSE).  THE NEW TANK AND USED X-MEMBER ARE NOW INSTALLED AND AWAITING AN ENGINE MECHANIC TO ADDRESS WHY THE ENGINE WON'T START UP DESPITE NEW TANK/FRESH FUEL/PUMP/FILTER.

THE FUEL TANK AND STRAPS HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE TANK RUPTURED WHEN IT WAS DRAGGING THE ROAD UNDERNEATH MY TRUCK BEFORE I COULD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE EMERGENCY REPAIRS WERE MADE BY MYSELF AND DURING THIS PROCESS I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE FUEL TANK VAPOR PRESSURE SENSOR HAD BROKE AS WELL DURING THE INCIDENT. THE SENSOR WAS PRICED AT THE LOCAL FORD DEALER FOR $102.00 BUT THIS PART HAS NOT BEEN REPLACED AND I AM CURRENTLY OPERATING MY VEHICLE WITHOUT THIS SAFETY DEVICE. I HAVE RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL SAFETY RECALL NOTICE 11S21 FROM THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE AND THE RECALL HAS BEEN PERFORMED TO MY VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH THE PARTS WERE BRAND NEW. I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT FROM A LOCAL FORD DEALER (DONLEY FORD OF SHELBY, OH) FOR THE FUEL TANK AND THE STRAPS. THE DEALER WOULD NOT REPLACE THE SENSOR BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GET AUTHORIZATION FROM FORD TO DO SO. I HAVE CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER CARE AND SPOKE WITH A SUPERVISOR NAMED [XXX]. HE INFORMED ME THAT FORD IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE SENSOR SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE IF IT HAD BEEN REPLACED PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. I PURCHASED THE TRUCK WHEN IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR OLD AND THIS PART HAS NEVER BEEN REPLACED. A COMPLAINT # 8802723 WAS FILED WITH EASTERN MICHIGAN BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ASKING FOR FORD TO REPLACE THE SENSOR, BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP ME AND HAVE CLOSED THE COMPLAINT. FORD'S REASON FOR NOT REPLACING THE PART WAS BECAUSE I DID THE REPAIRS MYSELF. I FEEL FORD IS LIABLE FOR THE PART AND SHOULD SUPPLY ME WITH A REPLACEMENT PART. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN CONVINCING FORD THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PART SINCE IS WAS BROKE AS THE RESULT OF A KNOWN RECALL ISSUE.

AFTER FUELING (3/4 TANK), WHILE APPROACHING A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE LAST STRAP BROKE AND THE TANK FELL TO THE PAVEMENT.

IT IS A MASTERCRAFT (AKA) COOPER TIRE KNOWN AS THE CT-C, WHICH IS A VERY HEARTY AND (SO I THOUGHT) WELL-MADE ITEM. I HAD BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY FOR ROUGHLY 15MINUTES OR SO THEN THIS HAPPENED AT A SPEED OF 65MPH AND I WAS LUCKY TO NOT LOSE TOTAL CONTROL ENTIRELY AND CRASH. I DID MY BEST TO HOLD CONTROL OF THE TRUCK AND BRING IT TO A SAFE STOP OF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY JUST WHERE AND EXIT WAS. UPON VISUAL INSPECTION IT SEEMS TO ME THE WAY THE TIRE CONVENIENTLY SEPARATED ITSELF, WITH THE SIDEWALLS STILL ON THE WHEEL OF THE TRUCK AND THE ENTIRE TREAD, BANDS AND BELTS ALL CAME OF AND ROCKETED ACROSS THE HIGHWAY WAS NOT DONE BY ROAD DEBRIS. I SAW THIS IN THE QUICK GLIMPSE OF IT LEAVING MY TRUCK, WHICH I CAUGHT IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR. I'M REALLY SHAKEN UP ABOUT THIS AND VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT MY OWN WELL BEING AND THAT OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME AND THOSE WHO RIDE WITH ME. WHAT SHOULD I DO? THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE ROAD DAMAGE TO ME, IF I HAD HIT SOMETHING (WHICH UPON SCOURING THE ROAD SURFACE NOTHING WAS FOUND), IT WOULD SEEM THAT MY FRONT TIRE WOULD HAVE HIT SOMETHING 1ST. MY WISH IS TO HAVE ALL 4 TIRES REPLACED (A DIFFERENT BRAND) AT THE COST OF THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE. MOST IMPORTANTLY I DO NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO BE POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF THIS FAILURE, AS I GOT VERY LUCKY! I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER SERIES OF FIRESTONE DEATHS WITH COOPER TIRES.

THE STRAPS HOLDING UP THE GAS TANK ON MY F-150 RUSTED THROUGH, DROPPING THE TANK [FORTUNATELY AT LOW SPEED WHERE I COULD STOP FAST - EVEN SO, ANOTHER FOOT OR SO AND I WOULD HAVE BURST THE TANK AGAINST A SEWER GRATING]. THE TANK WAS RUST-FREE, AS WERE THE VERTICAL PARTS OF THE STRAPS. I THINK THAT THE PLASTIC PAD BETWEEN THE STRAPS AND THE TANK HELD WATER AGAINST THE STRAP, RUSTING IT. THE PAD WRAPS AROUND THE STRAP, AND I BELIEVE SCOOPED WATER THROWN BY THE TIRES.   I SUGGEST EITHER A PAD REDESIGN TO ELIMINATE THIS, OR THAT THE STRAPS BE OF STAINLESS.    THE STRAPS APPEARED TO BE INTACT, BUT THE METAL WAS PRETTY MUCH CONVERTED TO RUST WITHOUT CHANGING SHAPE. IT IS NOT LIKE THE STRAPS WERE VISIBLY RUSTED AWAY. I SUSPECT THAT THE PAD HELD THE RUST IN PLACE.   I HAD CHANGED THE OIL NOT TOO LONG BEFORE AND NOTICED NOTHING WRONG. I DO NOT SPECIFICALLY RECALL LOOKING AT THE STRAPS, BUT I DO TRY TO LOOK AROUND WHEN I AM UNDER THE TRUCK JUST TO SEE IF ANYTHING IS FUNKY.    HAD I BEEN GOING AT ANY DECENT SPEED, NOT IN A PARKING LOT, I SUSPECT I WOULD HAVE BURNED TO DEATH....    THE REPAIR WAS SIMPLE; REPLACE THE STRAPS AND TWO PLASTIC VENT HOSE CONNECTIONS THAT FAILED. JACKING UP THE TANK [FULL] AND TYING IT UP SO THE TRUCK COULD BE PULLED UP ON A TILTBED WAS A HASSLE, MAINLY SINCE I DID NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS ON HAND.    A SIMPLE INSPECTION WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS INCIDENT, THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A VISUAL INSPECTION; POKING THE STRAP WITH A PICK TO VERIFY IT WASN'T ALL RUST JUST LOOKING LIKE SURFACE RUSTED METAL..    BUT YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT TAKE THAT NUMBER, SAYING IT IS INVALID.  IT IS A 1998 F-150 4WD, EXTENDED CAB, STICK SHIFT, WITH AC. *TR",

I TOOK THE TRUCK TO JIFFY LUBE FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND DROVE IT HOME, A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1 MILE.  JIFFY LUBE DID NOT NOTE ANY PROBLEMS WHEN THEY SERVICED THE TRUCK.   THE TRUCK WOULD NOT START THE NEXT TIME I WENT TO USE IT.  JUMPING IT DID NO GOOD, THE BATTERY WAS NOT LOW.  I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO CAR MAX   IT WAS TOWED ON A FLAT BED TRAILER, SO THE WHEELS NEVER TOUCHED THE GROUND.  I CALLED CAR MAX THE NEXT DAY AND THEY SAID THEY HAD IT SCHEDULED TO LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING DAY.  THEY CALLED ME THAT FOLLOWING DAY AND ASKED IF THE TRUCK WAS SMOKING WHEN I LAST DROVE IT.  I TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT AND THAT IT DROVE FINE.  THEN THEY TOLD ME THE ENGINE WAS BLOWN AND CONTINUED TO ACT AS THOUGH I HAD CAUSED IT.  ON MY NEXT DAY OFF, I RODE MY BICYCLE TO CAR MAX AND CHECKED THE TRUCK'S ODOMETER AGAINST THE MILEAGE JIFFY LUBE WROTE ON MY RECEIPT.  THERE WERE 28 MILES PUT ON MY TRUCK SINCE THE OIL CHANGE.  CAR MAX WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN THOUGH THEY BLEW THE MOTOR IN MY TRUCK, BUT DENY IT.  MY SON HAD DONE MOST OF THE OIL CHANGES ON THE TRUCK, SO I HAVE NO PROOF OIL CHANGES WERE DONE, SO CAR MAX DENIED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I CALLED FORD AND I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO SUCH ISSUE ON THE TRUCK, EVEN THOUGH FORD CHANGED THE HEAD STARTING WITH LATER 1998 MODELS, DUE TO A FAULTY DESIGN.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT WAS VERY FRUSTRATED WITH MY ASKING HOW THEY CAN DENY AN ISSUE, WHEN THEY PUT OUT INFORMATION TO THEIR DEALERS ON STEPS TO TAKE WHEN SERVICING THE F150.  SHE ASKED WHAT I WANTED THEM TO DO.  I TOLD HER I WAS NOT ASKING FORD TO REPLACE THE MOTOR BECAUSE I AM PAYING FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  BUT I WOULD LIKE THEM TO CONTACT CAR MAX AND TELL THEM THAT THE MOTOR BLOWING UP WAS NOT MY FAULT, SO CAR MAX WOULD COVER IT, AS THEY SHOULD ANYWAY.  SHE TOLD ME NO, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH THE 1997 AND 1998 FORD F150'S.  PLEASE HELP.   *TR",

SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION BY THE SHOP TO WHICH MY TRUCK WAS TOWED REVEALED THAT THE SECTOR SHAFT WAS BROKEN WHERE THE PITMAN ARM IS ATTACHED.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PART SHOULD NEVER FAIL IN A VEHICLE, REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE.  I WAS FURTHER TOLD THAT IF THE PART WAS POUNDED ALL DAY WITH A SLEDGE HAMMER THAT IT SHOULD NOT FAIL.  THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF ONE FAILURE EVER OF THIS PART IN A HIGH SPEED ACCIDENT.  FURTHERMORE, THIS PART IS LOCATED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WHICH DID NOT SUFFER ANY IMPACT FROM THE ACCIDENT. I CONTACTED FORD WITH THIS INFORMATION AND THEY ARE TOTALLY INDIFFERENT TO IT.

AFTER CHECKING SEVERAL WEB SITES I REALIZED MY TROUBLE IS NOT UNIQUE.  LOOKED AROUND THE INTERNET BUT NEVER FOUND A RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD RELATING TO THIS ISSUE.  FURTHER RESEARCH SEEMS TO IMPLY A MAJOR DEFECT THAT FORD KNEW ABOUT FROM CLOSE TO THE BEGINNING OF MANUFACTURING WHICH THEY NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING ABOUT.   ACCORDING TO A COUPLE OF WEB FORUM SITES, FORD PUT OUT TWO TECHNICAL BULLETINS TO THEIR SERVICE PEOPLE BUT NOT TO THE END USERS/BUYERS (TSB #99-20-7)   (FOLLOW UP TSB #99B209) THAT PRETTY MUCH ADMITTED THERE WAS A FAULT WITH A GASKET AND COULD RESULT IN ENGINE FAILURE, AS MINE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE.

THE TRUCK STARTED MAKING A LOUD- KNOCKING SOUND ONE MORNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER I STARTED THE TRUCK FOR WORK.       THE MECHANIC EXPLAINED TO ME THAT FORD HAD A BAD INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, WHICH ALLOWED COOLANT(ANTI-FREEZE) TO LEAK INTO THE OIL AND SPARK-PLUGS CAUSING THIS LOUD-KNOCKING NOISE WHICH IS A SPUN ROD BEARING. I KEEP REGULAR CHECK-UPS ON ALL ASPECTS(OIL LEVEL,COOLANT,ETC.) IF IT WERE A PROBLEM THAT  I CAUSED, I WOULD ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS NOT MY LACK OF MAINTENANCE , BUT A KNOWN ISSUE AMONG THE 4.2 V6 FORD MOTOR. FORD MOTOR CO. HAS MADE MY LIFE PURE HELL. I DO NOT HAVE $4,$5 THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE THEIR MISTAKE.

ONCE THE ENGINE STARTED, IT STRUGGLED A LITTLE AND THEN SMOOTHED OUT ONCE I BEGAN TO DRIVE.  THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO RUN FINE, ONCE STARTED, BUT CONTINUED WITH THE SLIGHT HESITATION WHEN STARTING THE ENGINE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, I ATTEMPTED TO START MY TRUCK AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD NOT TURN OVER RIGHT AWAY. I LET THE TRUCK REST A MOMENT THEN AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO START THE ENGINE.  THE TRUCK STARTED UP, THEN I HEARD THE SLIGHT HESITATION AND ALL OF SUDDEN I HEARD A LOUD BANG FOLLOWED BY A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE.    I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO MY MECHANIC WHEREUPON I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS A ROD KNOCK, WHICH SHOT DOWN THROUGH THE OIL PAN. HE FOUND COOLANT ON THE PLUGS AND WATER INTRUSION THROUGH THE INTAKE MANIFOLD INTO THE BLOCK.  HE INFORMED ME THAT MY ENGINE HAD HYDRO-LOCKED.  THROUGH RESEARCH I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THIS IS AN APPARENTLY WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.  I FOUND THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY ISSUED A RECALL ON THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET IN 1999.  I NEVER RECEIVED SUCH NOTIFICATION, ALTHOUGH I HAVE, IN FACT RECEIVED INFORMATION FOR OTHER RECALLS.  I WAS NEVER SENT ANYTHING IN THE MAIL AND HAD NO IDEA OF THIS PROBLEM.

I CURRENTLY HAVE 117,000 MILES ON MY TRUCK AND HAD TO PAY OVER $4,000.00 TO REPLACE THE LONG BLOCK.  I HAD TO PAY TO REPAIR A PROBLEM THAT FORD OBVIOUSLY KNEW EXISTED.  SINCE FORD WAS AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF DAMAGING THE ENGINE AND DID LITTLE, IF NOTHING, TO INFORM ITS CUSTOMERS OF THIS POTENTIAL DANGER, I FEEL THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD BE HELD, AT LEAST IN PART, LIABLE FOR THE DAMAGE INCURRED TO MY TRUCK AND TO MANY OF THOSE, LIKE MYSELF, WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.

I PULLED OFF TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY AND HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE NEAREST SHOP WHICH HAPPENS TO BE A FORD DEALER; DIABLO FORD IN PITTSBURGH, CA.  ON 09/12/05, THE FIRST DAY THE SERVICE DEPT WAS ABLE TO GET TO IT, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALER TELLING ME THAT BOTH HEAD GASKETS WERE BLOWN. THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE PULLED AND DISASSEMBLED TO CHECK ENGINE BEARINGS, CONNECTING RODS, VALVES AND PISTONS TO SEE IF THERE IS MORE DAMAGE THAN JUST BLOWN HEAD GASKETS. SO FAR THE QUOTE WITH INTERNAL ENGINE PARTS NOT DAMAGED IS $3200. THAT QUOTE COULD RISE VERY EASILY IF INTERNAL DAMAGE IS FOUND. SINCE THIS HAPPENED, I WAS ON THE FIGHTBACK.COM WEBSITE AND HAVE FOUND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH 1997 TO 1999 F150 FORD TRUCKS WITH 4.2 LITER ENGINES. APPARENTLY, FORD HAS CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THE HEAD GASKETS IN MID 1999, DUE TO CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FOR THESE PARTICULAR ENGINES.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS FORD REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM, AND HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE SHELLING OUT $3000+ TO REPAIR THEIR TRUCKS. IN SOME CASES, ENTIRE ENGINES WERE REPLACED FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS MORE. I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD RECALL AND COVER THE COSTS ON THE ENGINES. IF I'M NOT MISTAKING, THE 3.8 LITER V6 SHARES THE SAME BLOCK AND HEADS AS THE 4.2. THE 3.8 IS FOUND IN A LOT OF FORD WINDSTARS AND TAURUS'.

THE MASTER CYLINDER HAS BEEN BURNT AND THIS MAY POSE A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH LEAKS IN THE FUTURE.

OLD PART: F75Z*1A131*BC  NEW PART 2L3Z*1A131*AA  THIS INDICATES THEIR RECOGNITION THAT THERE WAS A DESIGN DEFECT IN THE ORIGINAL PART.  AS THESE VEHICLES AGE THERE WILL BE INCREASED CHANCE OF FUTURE FAILURE FROM CABLE STRAIN INCURRED DURING ROUTINE USE.  *JB",

THANK YOU, [XXX].  [XXX]  [XXX]  [XXX]  [XXX]        ENCLOSED ARE PICTURES OF THE TORSION BAR FROM MY 1998 FORD F-150 PICKUP. VIN# [XXX]. IT HAS 56,000 MILES. THE PORTION THAT IS PICTURED IS THE FRONT.    THE BAR BROKE WHILE SITTING IDLE IN MY GARAGE. I HAD BEEN OUT OF TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND SO THE PICKUP HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN FOR TWO DAYS. I FOUND THE CENTER PIECE ON THE GARAGE FLOOR. FROM RUST SPOTS IN THE BROKEN AREA, IT APPEARS THAT IT HAD BEEN CRACKED FOR SOME TIME.    I HAVE OWNED THE PICKUP FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. ALMOST ALL OF MY DRIVING HAS BEEN HIGHWAY DRIVING. DURING THAT TIME IT HAS VERY LITTLE OFF ROAD DRIVING. I AM NOT A HUNTER OR LAND OWNER. IT HAS BEEN USED FOR HAULING CARGO, BUT NOT EXTENDED USE.    IT WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AND I HAVE ALSO ENCLOSED THE REPAIR RECORDS FROM THAT. THE DAMAGE WAS TO THE RIGHT SIDE. THERE WAS NO SUSPENSION DAMAGED NOTED.    I HAVE LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS ON IT, AND HAVE FOUND NONE. THE MECHANIC WHO REPLACED IT FOR ME SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A TORSION BAR BREAK LIKE THIS. THIS IS A REPAIR THAT I DON\u0019T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR. I HAVE ENCLOSED MY STATEMENT.    I AM JUST THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT DRIVING THE VEHICLE WHEN IT BROKE. IT CONCERNS ME THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER SUSPENSION PROBLEMS.    WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT CAN BE DONE? IS THIS A FLAW IN THE PICKUP THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED?    I AM ALSO WRITING TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION TO ASK FOR THEIR HELP IN WHAT PROCESS I SHOULD FOLLOW.    I CAN BE REACHED DURING WORKING HOURS AT[XXX], AT MY ADDRESS AT [XXX] OR BY E-MAIL AT [XXX].    I WILL BE WAITING YOUR REPLY.

I FOUND THAT GASOLINE WAS RUNNING ALONG THE DRIVER SIDE FRAME AND LEAKING RATHER HEAVILY ONTO THE PAYMENT. I IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO A NEARBY AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE CENTER FOR EXAMINATION. I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADVISED THAT THE FUEL LINE HAD A CRACK AND WAS THE CAUSE FOR THE LEAKING FUEL. ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE TECHNICAN THE CRACK APPEARED TO BE UNKNOWN INCLUDING ANY DAMAGE. I HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY INSURANCE WITH GEICO FOR THE $277.87 REPLACEMENT LINE. SINCE I HAD A $250.00 DEDUCTIBLE, THE COST WAS MOSTLY BORNE BY ME. THE OWNER OF THE SERVICE CENTER, SAID HE NEVER HAD A CRACKED FUEL LINE IN ALL HIS YEARS OF AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE. I ALSO IN MY 50 YEARS OF OWNING VEHICLES HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A INCIDENT. MY BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THE EXTRAORDINARY DANGER THIS TYPE OF LEAK COULD CAUSE A MOTORIST, WITH GASOLINE LEAKING ON TO THE PAYMENT. OBVIOUSLY A DISCARDED CIGARET OR OTHER IGNITION COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS FIRE AND PERHAPS INJURY OR DEATH.I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED?

AN ARTICLE I WAS READING SUGGESTED CALLING A FORD DEALER FOR REPAIR, THE FORD DEALER STATED THAT FORD ONLY REPAIRS THE VEHICLE FOR THE FIRST 36,000 MILES. THE ARTICLE I READ STATED THAT FORD UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM TO BE CAUSED BY OPENING AND CLOSING THE DOOR AND WINDOW, WHICH CAUSES THE SHEET METAL, IN THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK, TO FLEX, WHICH OVER TIME FAILS AND CRACKS. THE PROBLEM WILL ONLY GET WORSE WITH TIME AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED REGARDLESS OF THE MILEAGE. MY CONCERN IS THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK AT A CORNER RADIUS AND COULD PROPAGATE TOWARD THE REAR OF THE DOOR. THE CRACK THAT HAS DEVELOPED, CAUSES TWO PROBLEMS, IT CREATES AN OPENING FOR WATER AND SALT TO CORRODE THE UNPROTECTED SHEET METAL ON THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR AND THE CRACK CREATES A PROBLEM, WERE THE VEHICLE TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT AND HIT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR. SINCE THE CRACK HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED, IT WOULD TAKE LITTLE IMPACT FOR THE CRACK TO PROPAGATE ALLOWING THE DOOR PANEL TO BE SEVERED, REMOVING ITS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. THE ARTICLE I READ STATED THAT FORD HAS FOUND THAT WELDING THE DOOR DOES NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THE CORRECTION CAN ONLY BE MADE BY REPLACING THE DOOR. AS THESE CRACKS HAVE DEVELOPED AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ON FORD F150 TRUCKS AFTER 36,000 MILES, HOW ARE THEY BEING REPAIRED? MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT IF THEY ARE BEING REPAIRED IN ANY MANNER, THEY ARE MOST LIKELY BEING WELDED TOGETHER AND REPAINTED, WHICH FORD HAS FOUND TO BE A INSUFFICIENT REPAIR. THE ONLY \"REPAIR\" IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE DOOR, WHICH WOULD BE COSTLY FOR THE CONSUMER. THIS PROBLEM WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY GET WORSE AS TIME GOES ON. FORD IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DEFECTS, AS THIS CLEARLY IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT. I ASKED THE NHTSA TO LOOK AT THIS MATTER MORE CLOSELY TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CRACK THAT DEVELOPS OVER TIME ON THE FORD F150 TRUCK DOORS.   *NLM",

I HAD PURCHASED AN F-150 SUPER CAB IN APRIL 2001 AND HADN\u0012T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DEFECT.  MY FRIENDS STATED THAT THE DOOR ON THE NEW F-150\u0012S WEREN\u0012T DESIGNED PROPERLY FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE DOOR AND WOULD START TO DEVELOP CRACKS.  THEY SAID THAT IF I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FORD WOULD PAY TO REPAIR THE CRACKS.  I CHECKED MY TRUCK AND I NOTICED A CRACK AT THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF MY DRIVER\u0012S DOOR NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDOW.   I WENT TO CROWNE FORD IN WARRENSBURG, MO 660-747-7111, ON 6 AUG 01 AND SPOKE WITH MR. CHRIS MARTEN HE INFORMED THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT FORD DIRECTLY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN APRIL 2001 THE WARRANTY ON MY TRUCK EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2001.  AFTER ARRIVING AT HOME I CALLED FORD ON 6 AUG 01 AT 11:45AM AT 800-392-3673 AND SPOKE WITH MARK, EMPLOYEE # 2547.  MARK INFORMED ME THAT FORD WOULD NOT REPAIR THE DEFECT SINCE THE 3/36-WARRANTY PERIOD HAD EXPIRED.  (NOTE) WHAT I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED IS THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT SINCE 1997.  THE DEFECT WAS CORRECTED IN THE 2000-YEAR MODELS BUT MANY CUSTOMERS WHO DISCOVERED CRACKS AND BROUGHT THEIR TRUCKS IN FOR REPAIR PRIOR TO 2000 HAD NEW DOORS INSTALLED WITH THE SAME DEFECT IN THEM.  FORD HAS EVEN SENT OUT A TECHNICAL BULLETIN TO THEIR DEALERS, ARTICLE # 01-2-6 BUT FAILED TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DEFECT.  FORD WOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS ONLY IF THE CUSTOMER BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER\u0012S ATTENTION WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD. THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH FORD NOT INFORMING THE PUBLIC ABOUT KNOWN DEFECTS WITH THEIR VEHICLES UNTIL AFTER SOMEONE GETS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED.  I HOPE THAT THE NHTSB CAN HELP RESOLVE THIS DEFECT FOR ALL FORD F-150 OWNERS AND MYSELF.  *AK",

        "summary": "AROUND 1 AUGUST 2001 I WAS TALKING WITH SOME FRIENDS AT WORK, DURING THE CONVERSATION DEFECTS IN THE DOOR DESIGN OF THE NEW FORD F-150 PICKUP TRUCK CAME UP.  I HAD PURCHASED AN F-150 SUPER CAB IN APRIL 2001 AND HADN\u0012T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DEFECT.  MY FRIENDS STATED THAT THE DOOR ON THE NEW F-150\u0012S WEREN\u0012T DESIGNED PROPERLY FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE DOOR AND WOULD START TO DEVELOP CRACKS.  THEY SAID THAT IF I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FORD WOULD PAY TO REPAIR THE CRACKS.  I CHECKED MY TRUCK AND I NOTICED A CRACK AT THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF MY DRIVER\u0012S DOOR NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDOW.   I WENT TO CROWNE FORD IN WARRENSBURG, MO 660-747-7111, ON 6 AUG 01 AND SPOKE WITH MR. CHRIS MARTEN HE INFORMED THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT FORD DIRECTLY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN APRIL 2001 THE WARRANTY ON MY TRUCK EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2001.  AFTER ARRIVING AT HOME I CALLED FORD ON 6 AUG 01 AT 11:45AM AT 800-392-3673 AND SPOKE WITH MARK, EMPLOYEE # 2547.  MARK INFORMED ME THAT FORD WOULD NOT REPAIR THE DEFECT SINCE THE 3/36-WARRANTY PERIOD HAD EXPIRED.  (NOTE) WHAT I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED IS THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT SINCE 1997.  THE DEFECT WAS CORRECTED IN THE 2000-YEAR MODELS BUT MANY CUSTOMERS WHO DISCOVERED CRACKS AND BROUGHT THEIR TRUCKS IN FOR REPAIR PRIOR TO 2000 HAD NEW DOORS INSTALLED WITH THE SAME DEFECT IN THEM.  FORD HAS EVEN SENT OUT A TECHNICAL BULLETIN TO THEIR DEALERS, ARTICLE # 01-2-6 BUT FAILED TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DEFECT.  FORD WOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS ONLY IF THE CUSTOMER BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER\u0012S ATTENTION WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD. THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH FORD NOT INFORMING THE PUBLIC ABOUT KNOWN DEFECTS WITH THEIR VEHICLES UNTIL AFTER SOMEONE GETS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED.  I HOPE THAT THE NHTSB CAN HELP RESOLVE THIS DEFECT FOR ALL FORD F-150 OWNERS AND MYSELF.  *AK",

I'VE ALSO NOTICED THE WELDS HOLDING THE ROOF TO THE SIDE PANELS ARE CRACKING DOWN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CAB ROOF.  THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT EITHER.

HAVING SAID THAT, I DROVE TO PORT ORANGE (DAYTONA BEACH), FLORIDA TO SEE MY FATHER WHO RECENTLY HAD SURGERY AND ON THE WAY HOME (ONLY 8 MILES INTO THE RETURN TRIP) I SUDDENLY GOT A VIBRATION IN THE RIDE. I WAS DOING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 70MPH ON THE INTERSTATE I-95.  I PULLED OVER AND CHECKED MY TIRES AND DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND SO ASSUMED THE PROBLEM WAS THE ROAD.  I THEN DROVE A SHORT DISTANCE AND CHANGED LANES BUT THE VIBRATION DIDN'T GO AWAY SO I KEPT TO A LOWER SPEED (AROUND 50) AND TOOK THE NEXT EXIT WHERE I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT AND DID A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF MY TIRES.  WHAT I FOUND WAS A RAISED AREA ON THE TREAD OF THE FRONT LEFT (DRIVER'S SIDE) TIRE. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES LONG AND 2 1/2 TO 3 INCHES WIDE.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETECT VISUALLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT RAISED VERY HIGH BUT WAS EASY TO DETECT BY RUNNING MY HANDS AROUND THE TREAD OF THE ENTIRE WHEEL.  I CHECKED ALL OTHER TIRES AND DIDN'T NOTICE A PROBLEM SO I LOCATED (WITH THE TELEPHONIC ASSISTANCE FROM MY PARENTS) A FIRESTONE DEALER BACK IN PORT ORANGE WHERE I HAD JUST COME FROM AND DROVE THERE. AT FIRST THE GUY IN CHARGE TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE A 2 HOUR WAIT SINCE HE HAD LOTS OF PAYING CUSTOMERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT AFTER EXPLAINING (RATHER FORCEFULLY) THAT THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY PROBLEM DUE TO A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND THAT I HAD AN 8 HOUR DRIVE AHEAD OF ME THAT HIS PRODUCT HAD ALREADY DELAYED BY AT LEAST 1 1/2 HOURS HE FINALLY TOLD ME HE WOULD GET ME IN THE BAY IN AN HOUR.  AT FIRST, HE WAS ONLY GOING TO REPLACE THE ONE TIRE. I INSISTED THEY INSPECT ALL THE TIRES AND IT WAS A GOOD THING I DID... THEY FOUND THE TREAD ON THE RIGHT FRONT WAS ALSO SEPARATING AND THAT IT WAS ALSO DANGEROUS AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED WHICH THEY DID.

I HAD PREVIOUSLY OWNED A VEHICLE THAT HAD ANTI-LOCK BRAKES AND THE BRAKE PETAL WOULD PUSH AGAINST MY FOOT AND MAKE A VIBRATING NOISE WHEN ACTIVATED.  THIS DOES NOT OCCUR ON THIS VEHICLE.  ALSO, WHEN THE VEHICLE IS COLD, ALL FOUR BRAKES WILL LOCK UP WHEN ANY PETAL PRESSURE IS APPLIED--ESPECIALLY AT LOW SPEEDS SUCH AS PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY OR OUT OF A PARKING LOT.  THIS WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FORD DEALER NEAREST MY RESIDENCE (NOT THE DEALER I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE TRUCK) ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS.  THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT IN WAS AT MY 30,000 MILE CHECK-UP ABOUT 10 MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE (AUGUST 27, 1998).  THEY CHECKED BRAKES AND NOTED ON THE SERVICE INVOICE \"COULD NOT VERIFY.\"  THE SECOND TIME I TOOK IT IN WAS ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER (MARCH 8, 1999) AFTER THE WINTER SEASON WAS OVER AND HAD THEM CHECK THE SYSTEM AND NO SERVICE WAS NOTED OR PERFORMED.  I TOOK AT FACE VALUE THAT WHEN THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG.  HOWEVER, ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CHECK YEAR ROUND BUT RATHER ONLY WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS SLIPPERY.  THEY SAID THEY CHECKED THEM BY PUTTING HEAVY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES AND THEN PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL AND RULED OUT FAILURE OF THE ABS.
