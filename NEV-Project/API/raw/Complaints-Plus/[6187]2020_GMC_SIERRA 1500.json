As I was slowing in anticipation of the light, now at about 5mph, my truck suddenly dropped and stopped.  This would have been catastrophic at freeway speeds!  I immediately thought maybe someone had tried to steal the wheel overnight as I knew now it was not simply a flat, but knew I had wheels locks and thought that unlikely....this was while I was exiting my now parked truck.  I knew the problem was on the front passenger side, and was shocked as I rounded the vehicle from the front only to find the entire front wheel assembly folded flat under my truck.  The entire brake assembly was still intact, but the front drive shaft was pulled out, as well as the upper and lower ball joints.  The brake hose became severed in this incident.",

This has happened on several occasions and after a time both indicator stop.    Issue 2: When traveling on a freeway, twice now, the cruise control suddenly disengaged or decreased mileage, as if it had detected a vehicle in front of us.  There was no vehicle within a quarter mile of us front or back, nor any vehicles on the side.  No debris in the road either.  Usually when the adaptive cruise is set and detects something in front the icons on the dash turn orange and starts to flash.  That didn't happen, rather the cruise icon changed to blue in color and the truck slowed.  This I would consider a safety risk.    Both instances (December 2020 and April 2021) have been reported to a dealership and noted in a file. When the customer care person attempted to get malfunction codes, nothing appeared to be wrong with the vehicle.",

As it started to rain and was getting muddy, and the grounds are in a grass field (No large rocks, hills or debris to climb as it's cleared land), she shifted the vehicle into 4wd high incase the field was slick. She started to drive and received several warning lights, \"Service ESC, Service traction control, brake light warning and check engine light\". The vehicle also had a noticeable wobble to the wheel and felt off balance, jerky, and had speed limited. My wife turned the vehicle off and back on and some of the lights went off, and the vehicle did not lurch or wobble anymore. The vehicle had a tire changed at the dealer the day prior, so I am unsure if that tire change is related or not. Now the vehicle shows an alert \"check engine, service emissions system\".
