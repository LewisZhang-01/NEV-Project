THIS WAS REPAIRED BY THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WENT BANKRUPT.      SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE A GASKET IN THE ENGINE THAT KEEPS ENGINE COOLANT AND ENGINE OIL FROM MIXING TOGETHER BECAUSE THE GASKET THAT WAS MANUFACTURED WITH THE CAR WAS NOT THE RIGHT THICKNESS.  (SINCE THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT BY MECHANICS WHY WASN'T THIS RECALLED OR A SERVICE BULLETIN INITIATED?)  I CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE DRIVER DOOR CONTROL PANEL THAT CONTROLS THE WINDOWS AND THE SIDE MIRRORS AND WINDOW LOCKS.  THE WINDOWS IN MY CAR CAN ONLY BE CONTROLLED BY THE DRIVER BECAUSE THE WINDOW LOCK IS STUCK IN THE \"ON\" POSITION.      I HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE WINDOWS FALLING DOWN INTO THE DOOR AND HAVE HAD ONE WINDOW REPLACED IN DECEMBER 2007 BUT NOW IN SEPTEMBER 2008 THE PASSENGER WINDOW IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AND NOW WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THIS WINDOW AS WELL.      RIGHT NOW THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT THIS CAR IS THE TURN SIGNALS.  THEY FUNCTION AS THEY SHOULD BUT THE CLICKING NOISE FOR THE TURN SIGNAL WILL NOT TURN OFF WHEN I HAVE MADE A TURN (IT ACTUALLY MAKES A CLICKING NOISE ABOUT 3 TIMES AS FAST AS THE REGULAR TURN CLICK).  I HAVE HAD THIS LOOKED AT BY A MECHANIC AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE HAZARD LIGHT RECALL WHICH MY CAR FALLS UNDER SO IT WAS NOT FIXED.  IT IS A VERY DISTRACTING PROBLEM AND THE ONLY TIME I CAN GET RELIEF FROM THE CLICKING NOISE IS WHEN I ACTUALLY GET READY TO MAKE A TURN BY TURNING ON THE ACTUAL TURN SIGNAL.      THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT NUMEROUS OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING.  I AM HOPING THAT SOME THING IS DONE ABOUT THE WINDOWS AND THE ENGINE GASKET.  I DON'T THINK CONSUMERS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR POOR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN.  GM SHOULD MAKE THINGS RIGHT.  *TR",
