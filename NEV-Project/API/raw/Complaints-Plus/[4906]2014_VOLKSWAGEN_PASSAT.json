My safety, along with my family's safety, and oncoming traffic were put at risk due to such poor visibility. I don't have this problem with my other Volkswagen (2017 Jetta).  The other problem I encountered is with my steering wheel. I was turning and I heard what sounded like a crinkle type noise. It was rather brief so I didn't pay attention and then it made the sound again when I turned wheel in the opposite direction and again on my next turn.  The following day I heard the same type of noise while turning in either direction and then the noise sounded like a spring breaking. I then noticed a light on my dash come on. The light was orange in color displaying a similar no seat belt wearing flash display. Once I was home I looked into what dash light meant and it had to do with an airbag malfunction. I went on to notice that none of my steering wheel functions worked nor did my horn. I researched possible recall involving steering wheel clock spring in a 2014 Passat and found it was indeed a recall. I purchased this car for my soon to be licensed son and he needs these recalls fixed as soon as possible in order to use car for his driving test in April. The nearest VW dealer is in Green Bay, WI which is a few hours away from my home. I was informed by a close friend that works for VW that recalls could be fixed by Halbinsel Mazda in Escanaba MI. My other VW is currently in storage and I am unable to get to it until spring time when the snow melts. This leaves me with the Passat with poor visibility and if I were to get in an accident the airbag wouldn't deploy because of clock spring recall nor can I warn anybody by honking my horn. Both recalls are putting myself, my loved ones and traffic at major safety risks. My vehicle is available for inspection, so matter can be resolved as soon as possible.",

I complained to the dealership but they said that failure of the system was a \"characteristic\" and not a \"defect\".  In my opinion, having an operational backup camera is a safety feature.

I now see on the internet that VW has issued a recall of over 32,000 vehicles (model year 2021) for the exact same problem  -- losing the rearview camera and infotainment displays.  By the way, lose of the system in my car also means that I cannot use my mobile phone  \"hands-free\" thru the car, which is also a safety feature.  So, if VW is issuing a recall for 2021 vehicles for this same issue as my car, why must I pay over $2,500 for it to be repaired on my 2014 Passat?",

I called AAA and had a tow truck come so that I could have the car towed to the dealership. The driver was able to wiggle the key and start the car. I dropped off the car at the dealership on Saturday Oct 30th. I was told by the dealership that the key cylinder and steering wheel lock housing plus keys need to be replaced. I contacted VW of America and was told that they will not replace the part because the car is out of warranty. This is obviously a defect as there have been many recalls with this part in different model VW's. The dealership is trying to charge me $934.03 for this repair which I believe is a defect. Service advisor at Volkswagen stated that it is not safe to drive the car as it could leave me stranded.

I was able to pull off the main lanes before the car died and would not re-engage after three attempts to restart.   On the third attempt, the car stopped attempting to crank and the dash lights all began to blink until the only extra light that was left was the coil (glow plug indicator).  We were left stranded in the street for a while until we could safely exit to push it out of the road and to a safe place.  I later had the car towed to my mechanic where the issues were accessed and diagnosed.  The causation of the failure is a combination of the first fuel pump failing and disintegrating then dispersing medal shards throughout the fuel system and ruining it entirety.  I have never had any indicators or issues with this vehicle.  There were no prior warnings or problems with the car.  I was very blind sided and stranded in the road then felt forced to put myself in harms way to get it pushed out of danger and prevent an accident with another vehicle.",

WHEN I RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTIFICATION FOR THE AIRBAGS I BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY LOCAL VW DEALER TO HAVE THE AIRBAGS REPLACED.  WE TOOK THE CAR FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE AIRBAGS OF AN AMERICAN SPECIFICATION CAR.  I HAD A GERMAN ATTORNEY CALL THE DEALERSHIP TO TRY AND FIND A WAY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED AND WAS ULTIMATELY TOLD IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  THE WORK AROUND WAS TO HAVE A MEMORANDUM PREPARED WHEN THE TIME COMES TO SHIP THE VEHICLE SAYING THE DEFECTIVE AUTO WILL BE REPAIRED UPON RETURN TO THE U.S..  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS MY JOB IS HERE AND I HAVE NO SET DATE TO RETURN TO THE U.S..  MY FAMILY IS FORCED TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH AIRBAGS THAT CAN KILL US.  I CAN'T TRADE OR SELL THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT HAS A KNOWN DEFECT THAT I CAN'T GET REPAIRED IN GERMANY.  I NEED VW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  AT THIS POINT I WOULD PREFER THEY TAKE THE CAR BACK.  THE VW WEBSITE HAS ONE LITTLE PARAGRAPH DEALING WITH MILITARY MEMBERS AND THE SOLUTION THEY PROVIDE DOES NOT HELP US BECAUSE AGAIN, WE DO NOT HAVE A RETURN DATE.  THE 1-800# IS ALWAYS BUSY AND VW GERMANY BELIEVES IT IS QUITE INCAPABLE OF HAVING AN AIRBAG SHIPPED FROM THE U.S. TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE.  I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ANY LONGER AND WOULD APPRECIATE ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THE CAR RETURNED TO VW.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.",

MY CAR IS 3 YEARS OLD AND HAS 75K MILES SO I WAS BLOWN AWAY!  I CALLED NUMEROUS MECHANICS AND ALL TOLD ME THEY'VE SEEN SIMILAR PROBLEMS ON VW AND AUDI VEHICLES.  I WENT ONLINE TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND A NUMBER OF FORUMS WITH VW CUSTOMERS WITH IDENTICAL PROBLEMS.  ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HPFP FAILING AND THEN RESULTING IN METAL IN THE FUEL SYSTEM, CAUSING AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT OF THE FUEL SYSTEM.  I ALSO READ THAT VW HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTY OF THE HPFP ON EARLIER MODELS DUE TO SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT VW HAS STILL NOT FIXED THIS PROBLEM ON ITS NEWER MODELS AND NEEDS TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY OR ISSUE A RECALL.  THEY ARE SELLING FAULTY CARS THAT ARE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AND REQUIRE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FIXES.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.

RADIO SCREEN GOES BLANK EVEN IF RADIO IS ON AND USER IS UNABLE TO CONTROL IT FOR UP TO A FEW MINUTES.  ON 2 OCCASIONS, EVEN AFTER TURNING THE ENTIRE CAR ON AND OFF MULTIPLE TIMES THE RADIO WAS ON BUT ALL CONTROLS WERE INOPERABLE AND UNABLE TO TURN OFF.

SAFETY ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH VW DEALER AND THEY STATED VW KNOWS ABOUT ALL THE OWNER INQUIRIES INTO THIS ISSUE BUT IT HAS YET TO MAKE A RECALL.  MY CONCERN IS THAT BACKUP CAMERA DOES NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD AND THEREFORE THE SAFETY FEATURE THAT THE VEHICLE CAME WITH DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. THIS CAUSES THE DRIVER TO GO IN REVERSE WITH ONLY THE HELP OF MIRRORS.  IF SAFETY EQUIPMENT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN IT SHOULD BE REPLACED. SECOND, WHEN THE SYSTEM CONTROLS MALFUNCTION THE VOLUME AND ON/OFF BUTTONS CANNOT BE USED AND THEREFORE DRIVER IS LEFT FOCUSING ON HOW TO FIX THIS ISSUE NOT ON KEEPING THEIR EYES ON THE ROAD.  AS PER MY DISCUSSION BOTH WITH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT CORPORATE OFFICE, THEY ADMITTED TO THE RECURRING ISSUE FOR MANY VW OWNERS BUT SAID IT HAD NOT BECOME A BIG ENOUGH ISSUE OR SAFETY CONCERN SO THERE WAS NOT RECALL.  MY QUESTION IS IF SYSTEM (BACKUP CAMERA/RADIO/NAVIGATION) IS ALREADY A DOCUMENTED ISSUE FOR MANY OWNERS AND DOES NOT ALLOW A SAFETY FEATURE TO WORK PROPERLY (BACKUP CAMERA) OR CAN CAUSE A DISTRACTION FOR A VEHICLE OPERATOR THEN WHY IS NOT A RECALL.

TODAY, APRIL 11, 2014, WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY FROM NEW ORLEANS TO BATON ROUGE MY CAR ACCELERATED TO 80 MILES AND STAYED AT THAT RATE (WITHOUT ME HAVING MY FOOT ON THE GAS), APPROXIMATELY 7 OR 8 TIMES. MY SPEED DID NOT GO DOWN UNLESS I PRESSED ON THE BREAKS, SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS WHEN SOMEONE ENGAGES CRUISE CONTROL (BUT I HAD NOT ENGAGED CRUISE CONTROL).    ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES, I COULD NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE MOVEMENTS NECESSARY TO RECREATE THE EFFECT. HOWEVER, I DO KNOW THAT IT OCCURRED AT LEAST SOME OF THE TIMES (AND POSSIBLY EVERY TIME) WHEN I WAS ACCELERATING TO PASS A CAR *AND* MOVED TO THE RIGHT HAND LANE. TOWARDS THE END OF MY DRIVE I MADE SURE TO ONLY BE TOUCHING THE STEERING WHEEL AT THE BOTTOM, THEREFORE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT I ACCIDENTALLY ENGAGED THE CRUISE CONTROL VIA ANY OF THE SIDE LEVERS, AND ON MY MODEL THE ONLY BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ITSELF WERE FOR RADIO VOLUME AND STATION.     I DID NOT GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, BUT I COULD IMAGINE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD THIS ISSUE ARISEN DURING DENSER TRAFFIC CONDITIONS.   *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
