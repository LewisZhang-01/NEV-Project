        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS BRAND NEW TOW TRUCK IN JULY 2015, EQUIPPED WITH AN ENGINE BRAKE.  AFTER USING IT ON MOUNTAINS WITH HIGH % DOWNGRADES, REALIZED THE ENGINE BRAKE WAS NOT WORKING.  I HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING FOR MONTHS, AND THE TOW TRUCK COMPANY HAS BEEN TRYING TO SELL ME THE SISTER TRUCK WITH THAT ENGINE BRAKE NOT WORKING ALSO.  NOW, I AM TOLD THAT FORD FORGOT TO HOOK UP THE ENGINE BRAKE, AND THE SISTER TRUCK HAS BEEN SOLD TO AN UNKNOWING TOW TRUCK COMPANY.  WITHOUT AN ENGINE BRAKE HOOKED UP THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION, THE TRUCK WILL LOSE ITS BRAKES BY GETTING HOT, CATCHING FIRE, AND HAVING A TOTAL FAIL GOING DOWN A STEEP MOUNTAIN, ENDANGERING NOT ONLY THE DRIVER, BUT INNOCENT PASSENGERS THAT OWN THE VEHICLE WE ARE TOWING.  THESE TRUCKS CARRY 5 PASSENGERS AND A DRIVER, AND IS A FLATBED TOW TRUCK THAT IS EQUIPPED TO CARRY 12,000 POUNDS ON THE FLATBED.  SOMEBODY IS GOING TO DIE!  WE THOUGHT WE HAD THE ONLY ONE LIKE THIS, BUT JUST FOUND OUT THERE IS THE SISTER TRUCK THAT WAS SOLD LAST WEEK.  WOW.  WE HAVE HAD OUT NEW TRUCK IN THE ENGINE FACILITY AND THE TRANSMISSION ALLISON FACILITY UPON THE ADVICE OF THE FORD DEALER.  NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT.  WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE BRAKE IS NOT HOOKED UP TO THE TRANSMISSION, THAT FORD FORGOT TO DO THAT PART.  WE ARE AFRAID TO USE THAT TRUCK ON THE STEEP DOWNGRADES COMING IN AND OUT OF DEATH   VALLEY, CA.  THAT IS WHAT I BOUGHT THE TRUCK FOR!",
