A RECENT SERVICE NOTED THE BRAKE CALIPERS WERE FREE TO MOVE, BUT SUITABLE LUBRICANT WAS APPLIED AS A PRECAUTION.    TWO WEEKS AGO, APPROACHING A SHARP DOUBLE BEND AT 40 TO 50 MPH, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR WITH NO RETARDING ACTION.  I COULD NOT TAKE THE CURVE AT THAT SPEED, AND QUICKLY PUT THE AUTO GEARBOX INTO LOW, AND STEERED OFF THE ROAD ONTO THE GRASS, THEN A FARM ENTRANCE. I WAS LUCKY - ELSEWHERE THAT ROAD HAS A DRAINAGE DITCH ALONGSIDE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS.    AFTER STOPPING I REALIZED THERE WAS A VERY STRONG BURNING SMELL FROM BOTH REAR BRAKES. I CRAWLED ALONG FOR HALF A MILE AND PARKED UP.  NEXT MORNING THE PEDAL FEEL HAD RETURNED; IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT OVERHEATING HAD BOILED THE FLUID CAUSING PRESSURE LOSS.    I PHONED THE SPECIALIST RV GARAGE WHICH SERVICES IT.  THEY TOLD ME IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAD 4 VEHICLES WITH THE SAME FAULT, AND REPLACED BRAKE CALIPERS IN WHICH THE PISTONS WERE SEIZING OR HANGING.    ALL WERE ON THE WORKHORSE CHASSIS, AROUND 2002 -3 WITH SIMILAR USAGE AND MILEAGE.  I AM CONVINCED THIS IS A SERIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT AFFECTING RVS IN THE UK.    I NOTE  ON YOUR WEBSITE WORKHORSE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS FAULT, STATING THAT IT AFFECTS THE W22 CHASSIS ETC.  THE SERVICE MECHANIC HERE ASSURES ME THE VERY SAME BRAKES ARE ALSO FITTED TO THE P22 CHASSIS (WHICH MINE IS).    IN THE UK THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL CAMPAIGN OR PUBLICITY ABOUT THE FAULT.
