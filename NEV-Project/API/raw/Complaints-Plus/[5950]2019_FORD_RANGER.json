These incidents are extremely dangerous as the flashing and chiming from the alert system is very distracting and causes someone to react to this as opposed to focusing on driving the vehicle.

Also it seems to not get the power to the road as if the transmission slips. It is intermittent. The start stop feature which I usually turn off, sometimes does not work correctly. I have only had this vehicle for about 5 months. When the start stop feature is off the vehicle still acts as if its on. I have read blogs of many people having similar transmission issues. A local Ford dealer told me it drove fine, nature of the beast and it shifts that way to save fuel. Also on off the gas there is a hard clunk which seem to harsh.

The tire became almost vertical and at a right angle to the direction of the vehicle. An estimated 4 miles was drive before the driver became aware of the problem when an observant motorcyclist motioned the vehicle over. The tire was very hot where it contacted the pavement but had not yet ignited.  The tire was roped to the frame to keep it off the pavement to safely drive to a service center. The photo of the tire under the truck shows its approximate position during the incident. The actual position was almost vertical. The photo of the tire chain clamp bracket shows it's position without the tire. The crank mechanism was damaged to the point that the chain could not raise or lower the bracket.  A tire fire would have resulted if the vehicle was driven much further.  The manufacturer will be contacted.",

FROM THEN UNTIL NOW THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 6 INSTANCES WHERE THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER HAS BEEN PLACED IN PARK, BUT THE TRUCK HAS FREELY ROLLED AWAY. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY, WHILE PARKED ON A BUSY STREET, IN A CROWDED PARKING GARAGE IN DENVER, AND A COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES. I'VE BEEN LUCKY EACH TIME IT ROLLED AWAY IN AN AREA CROWDED WITH PEDESTRIANS OR TRAFFIC HEAVY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND JUMP BACK IN AND PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, WITHOUT SOMEONE GETTING RUN OVER. IN THE PARKING GARAGE A FRIEND OF MINE WOULD HAVE BEEN PINNED BETWEEN THE TRUCK AND A CONCRETE WALL IF SHE HAD BEEN JUST ONE SECOND SLOWER WALKING AROUND THE TRUCK. WE HAD JUST PARKED AND WERE GOING TO WALK TO THE ELEVATOR AND WERE TOO BUSY TALKING TO NOTICE THE TRUCK WAS ROLLING TOWARD US. RIGHT AFTER SHE WAS OUT OF THE PATH WE HEARD SOMETHING BEHIND US AND TURNED TO SEE IT HAD HIT THE WALL, ABOUT 3 INCHES AWAY FROM THE BACK OF HER LEGS.   I'VE TAKEN THE TRUCK INTO 2 DEALERSHIPS TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS WITNESSES THAT HAVE SEEN ME PLACE THE TRUCK IN PARK, ONLY TO HAVE IT MOVE ON ITS OWN, BUT LUTHER FAMILY FORD IN FARGO, ND AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER CARE HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY DO NOT ACCEPT WITNESS ACCOUNTS FOR ANY ISSUE ON THEIR VEHICLES. THEY HAVE SAID THAT IF A WARNING LIGHT DOESN'T ILLUMINATE OR AN ERROR CODE ISN'T RECORDED IN THE DIAGNOSTICS THEN A PROBLEM DOES NOT EXIST. BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE VEHICLE IS UNSAFE AND MAY END UP KILLING SOMEONE THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENS. I'M A DISABLED VETERAN AND HAVE SOME MOBILITY ISSUES, THE NEXT TIME I MAY NOT BE FAST ENOUGH TO GET TO THE TRUCK TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, OR I MAY NOT BE FAST ENOUGH TO MOVE IF I'M IN THE PATH OF THE TRUCK , AND THEN I'LL BE THE ONE CRUSHED UNDERNEATH THE RUNAWAY POS.",

THE PRE COLLISION WARNING ALSO FREQUENTLY ALERTS WITH VISUAL AND AUDIBLE WARNINGS. ALL OF THESE WILL HAPPEN AT ANY RANDOM TIME, AND OF ALL THE COUPLE DOZEN TIMES THESE WARNINGS HAVE HAPPENED THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE TIME THAT THERE WAS ANY TRAFFIC NEARBY, NOR WAS THERE ANYTHING BLOCKING ANY CAMERA OR SENSOR. THE VEHICLE IS BARELY MORE THAN A MONTH OLD AND HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP A FEW TIMES TO FIX BODY ALIGNMENT ISSUES AND PROGRAMMING ISSUES WITH THE ECU, PCM AND TCU. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT THE PRE COLLISION SYSTEM ONLY WORKS IF YOU ALSO HAVE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL, WHICH MY TRUCK DOES NOT. THEY SAID THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX THE SYSTEM TO GET IT TO STOP GIVING FALSE WARNINGS UNLESS THEY ADD THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL MODULE AND OTHER COMPONENTS. HOWEVER, THE DEALERSHIP IS REFUSING TO ADD THE ADDITIONAL PARTS AND ALSO REFUSING TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH ONE THAT DOES. THEY TOLD ME FORD IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, AND ADMITS THAT A FALSE WARNING MAY ACTIVATE THE BRAKING SYSTEM ON ITS OWN, WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, BUT THEY STATED THAT FORD WILL NOT PAY CORRECT THE ISSUE.   THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND FORD NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THEIR FAULTY, AND DANGEROUS, COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM. THEY NEED TO INSTALL ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IN VEHICLES WITHOUT IF THAT'S ALL IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THE ISSUE AND MAKE VEHICLES SAFE TO DRIVE.",

THE TEST ONLY INDICATES THAT FUEL DILUTION IS ABOVE 5%, WHICH ITSELF LEADS TO SEVERE OIL DEGRADATION. WHEN I CHANGED THE OIL, I DRAINED 7.5 QUARTS OUT OF AN ENGINE WITH A 6.2 QUART CAPACITY. THIS WOULD INDICATE A 21% FUEL DILUTION, NOT INCLUDING FUEL THAT HAS EVAPORATED FROM THE CRANKCASE AND RETURNED TO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER VIA THE PCV SYSTEM. IF I ABIDED BY THE MANUAL'S RECOMMENDED OIL CHANGE INTERVAL, I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THE ENGINE WOULD EVENTUALLY CATCH FIRE, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL TESTS COMPARING FUEL DILUTION TO AN OIL'S FLASHPOINT.     AFTER CHANGING THE OIL, IT SMELLED FINE FOR THE FIRST 20 MILES OR SO. AFTER THAT, THE OIL BEGAN TO FEEL OF GASOLINE AGAIN.     AFTER GOING THROUGH FORD'S SERVICE MANUALS, I HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT THE PROBLEM MUST LIE IN THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP. IT RUNS OFF THE CAMSHAFT, WHERE LEAKING FUEL COULD THEN MAKE IT INTO THE ENGINE AND MIX WITH OIL. THERE WOULD BE NO WARNING OR INDICATION, BESIDES RISING OIL LEVELS ACCOMPANIED BY THE SMELL OF GASOLINE IN THE OIL.    IT DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY THAT MY DEALER IS NOT TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A FUEL LEAK OF ANY KIND ALWAYS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO A FIRE OR EXPLOSION IN THE HOT ENGINE BAY. I PAID OVER $40K FOR THIS TRUCK, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE OIL EVERY 500 MILES TO KEEP IT FROM SELF DESTRUCTING.     THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN THE RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE. I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE, AND FORD HAS REPEATEDLY CHOSEN NOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

CONTINUED TO GET WORSE TO A POINT WHERE I BECAME AFRAID TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE TWICE ON HEAVY BRAKING PULSATION WAS SEVER AND I WAS AFRAID WAS NOT GOING TO STOP. SITUATION WAS WORSE MORE TRUCK WAS DRIVEN. NOTIFIED SERVICE ADVISOR OF ISSUE AND THAT I HAD BEEN REALLY CAREFUL BUT THEN I NOTIFIED HIM AGAIN AND ADVISED I WAS FEARFUL OF DRIVING VEHICLE ESPECIALLY ON WET ROAD. TOOK PICTURE OF LEFT REAR ROTOR THRU WHEEL HOLES AND FOUND BLACK SPOTS IN ROTOR. TOOK TRUCK IN ON MARCH 19TH, SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED AND SAID THE MECHANIC WAS GOING TO HAVE ALL FOUR ROTORS TURNED. I TOLD HIM THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE, THE ROTORS AND BRAKES NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE SITUATION WAS ESCALATED TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY, TODAY MARCH 26TH THE SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED AND LEFT MESSAGE THEY WERE REPLACING REAR ROTORS. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM BACK BECAUSE I FEEL THEY NEED TO ALSO REPLACE BRAKE PADS, FOR A PROPER MATING PROCESS. HE NEVER MENTIONED FRONT ROTORS AGIN AS IN PREVIOUS DICUSSION. I ORIVINALLY ADVISED THEM THEY SHOULD REPLACE ALL ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS. THEM TELLONG ME THEY WERE GOING TO TURN ALL ROTORS MAKES ME THINK THAT ALL THE ROTORS ARE WARPED. ALSO REAR SEAT UPPER PORTION WHEN RELEASED TO DOWNWARD POSITION, IS VERY HARD TO RELOCK IN UPPER POSITION, WHICH IF NOT LOCKED TO CAUSE SEATBELTED PASSENGERS ND SEAT ITSELF TO FLY FORWARD IN A FRONTAL CRASH.",
