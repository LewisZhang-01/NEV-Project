DAMAGE ON MY RAV 4 WAS CAR HOOD FOLDING BACK AND UP AND MY FRONT UPPER AND LOWER SECTION OF MY BUMPER AND PLASTIC GRILL AREA.  I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION PROBLEM TO T HE TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY THE NEXT DAY AND THEY SENT A 3RD PARTY ENGINEERING ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE MY CAR.

WE TOWED THE RAV TO OUR CLOSEST AUTHORIZED TOYOTA REPAIR FACILITY, THEN EXPLICITLY ASKED IF THEY WOULD CHECK BOTH THE ECM AND TRANSMISSION. THE SERVICE REP GAVE A $4200 TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT ESTIMATE, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF THE ECM MODULE, EVEN THOUGH I SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT THIS.    1) TOYOTA SHOULD EXTEND THEIR RECALL ON THE ECM MODULES INDEFINITELY AND PAY FOR BOTH ECM AND TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT, SINCE THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN DEFECT AND A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE. IF THE CIRCUITRY IN THE ECM WERE TO MALFUNCTION AT HIGH SPEEDS IT MIGHT CAUSE FATALITIES OR SERIOUS INJURIES.    2) THE SPECIFIC TOYOTA DEALER SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE ECM IN THEIR ESTIMATES AND MADE GREATER EFFORTS TO WORK WITH TOYOTA TO REMEDY THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION AND ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES IN GENERAL, FOR THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS DEALERSHIPS SERVICE DEPARTMENT INTENTIONALLY DIVERTED ATTENTION FROM THE ECM DEFECT AND ITS LIABILITY TO AVOID THE EXPENSE AND COMPLICITY INVOLVED IN WHAT WOULD SEEM TO BE A LEGITIMATE ON-GOING SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",

YOUR CAR SUDDENLY STOPPING ON THE HIGHWAY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DANGERS ONE CAN FACE WHILE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE.JUST TO BE CLEAR , THE FIRST TIME THE CAR STOPPED ON ME WAS IN 2006. I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND THEY ACTED AS IF I WAS OUT OF MY MIND. I PAID , THE $1400 TO THE DEALER FOR A NEW ECM. 2 WEEKS LATER THE CAR STOPPED AGAIN. THE SAID IT WAS MY FAULT. 6 WEEKS AFTER THAT , ( STILL IN 2006) TOYOTA SENT A SERVICE LETTER DESCRIBING THE EXACT PROBLEM I'D PAID FOR BUT I GOT NO REFUND. A MONTH LATER , YUP YOU GUESSED IT.I PAID AGAIN AND EVERYTHING WAS OK AT BEST UNTIL JANUARY 2009 WHEN IT STOPPED YET AGAIN. I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP SPENDING MONEY LIKE THIS FOR A PROBLEM THAT IS ENTIRELY TOYOTAS FAULT AND OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE.  PLEASE PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  *TR",

I THEN TOOK THE READINGS TO TOYOTA WHO TOLD ME THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT AUTOZONE'S DIAGNOSTIC AND I HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE FROM THEM WHICH COST $100.

I AM MORE UPSET WITH THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR IN MAY OF 2006 AND THEY KNEW THEN THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

WHEN THE CAR WAS COLD, I WOULD STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR AND THE CAR WOULD CRAWL ALONG; THEN IT WOULD BEGIN TO SLIP, AS IF I HAD HIT A PATCH OF ICE--THE ENGINE WOULD REV BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO FORWARD.  AND I HEARD A LOUD AND OMINOUS CLANKING NOISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CAR AS I CRAWLED ALONG.  AS THE ENGINE WARMED UP, THE PROBLEM SUBSIDED SO I HEADED HOME.  AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY THE CAR STALLED MOMENTARILY.  THANKFULLY, NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED, THOUGH I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN REAR-ENDED.      AFTER MANY HOURS SPENT WITH MY MECHANIC, OUR SELLING TOYOTA DEALER, AND A LOCAL TRANSMISSION SHOP, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE ECU MODULE IN THE RAV WAS GOING BAD AND THAT IS WHAT WRECKED OUR TRANSMISSION.  WE NEEDED A REBUILT TRANSMISSION AND A NEW ECU MODULE.  GRAND TOTAL FOR THE WORK:  A WHOPPING $4500!    I GOOGLED THE PROBLEM AND READ THAT HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM; THAT IN 2006 TOYOTA ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN TO ITS DEALERS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH ECUS IN RAVS MODEL YEAR 2001-2003.  BUT THE OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES WERE NEVER NOTIFIED, LEADING TO A BURN-OUT OF RAV TRANSMISSIONS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST TOYOTA TO GET THEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PARTS.    I CALLED TOYOTA; THEY POLITELY BUT FIRMLY REFUSED TO PAY FOR ANY OF THE WORK, SIMPLY CLAIMING THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THEN I SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP--SAME ANSWER.      THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF MONEY AND INCONVENIENCE; THESE VEHICLES ARE DANGEROUS AND I BELIEVE IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INTO AN ACCIDENT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS THAT TOYOTA INSTALLED IN ITS VEHICLES.

HAD MECHANIC WITH OVER 15 YRS EXPERIENCE AT TOYOTA DEALERSHIP CHECK IT (AFTER HOURS). HE WAS UNAWARE OF CONNECTION TO FAULTY ECM SO WE THOUGHT TRANY WAS BAD & HE FLUSHED TRANNY.

I LIVE ON A SEMI-RURAL OHIO STATE ROUTE WITH 55MPH POSTED LIMIT & 65MPH AVERAGE SPEED. I HAD NUMEROUS NEAR MISSES WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY OR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE NORMALLY THEN SLIPPED, HESITATED, OR REFUSED TO SHIFT.

TRAFFIC BEHIND YOU CAN EASILY RUN INTO YOU AND IF YOU ARE ENTERING A FREEWAY, YOU CAN BE SERIOUSLY INJURED BY TRANSMISSION FAILING OR STALLING AS A RESULT.  TOYOTA ISSUED A TSB IN 2006 TO DEALERS YET DID NOT NOTIFY OWNERS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND AN IMMEDIATE RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM.

MY MECHANIC INDICATED HE HAS SEEN OVER 100 VEHICLES ON THIS AT HIS BUSINESS ALONE.  THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM.  SINCE MY VEHICLE IS OVER 8 YRS OLD AND 115K MILEAGE, THERE IS NO EXTENDED WARRANTY.  WHY DID TOYOTA NOTIFY ITS DEALERS IN MARCH 2006 OF THE PROBLEM AND NOT NOTIFY THE CUSTOMERS.  WHY HAVE YOU NOT ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BY ASKING TOYOTA TO ISSUE A RECALL TO CORRECT THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.  IF THE COMPUTER FAILS COMPLETELY,  THE CAR WILL MORE THAN LIKELY STOP IN TRAFFIC.  MY MECHANIC INDICATES THAT A NEW COMPUTER MUST BE PUT IN AND THE TRANSMISSION MUST BE RE BUILT.    THIS STARTED ON FRIDAY, SEPT 18TH, ABOUT 4PM AS I WAS DRIVING HOME ON THE FREEWAY.

I WAS TOLD IT IS THE RIGHT MODULE AND NOT THE RECALLED ONE. SO, I PURCHASED THIS CAR FROM THE PRIVATE PARTY. AFTER 9 MONTHS OF USING THIS CAR, I GET THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED. THE CAR JERKS WHEN ACCELERATING. SOMETIMES IT REFUSES TO ACCELERATE. TOYOTA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR BUT WHEN I PURCHASED IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. I THINK IT IS A FAULTY PART IN THE CAR. IF REPLACING ECU DOES NOT FIXES THE PROBLEM THEN WE HAVE TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION WHICH WILL COST ME ADDITIONAL $4000. TO REPLACE NEW ECU OR ECM, IT COSTS $1100+. PLEASE ASK TOYOTA TO RECALL THE RAV4S. THIS IS A BIG BLOW TO US IN THIS ECONOMY. *TR",

IN SEPT 2006 I CALLED TOYOTA TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE $2800 REPAIR DUE TO WHAT THEY HAD CALLED \"OIL GEL\". THE REFERENCE NUMBER FOR THIS CALL IS [XXX]. AT THE TIME I WAS UNAWARE OF THE LAW SUIT IN PROCESS FOR SOME TOYOTA ENGINES DUE TO THIS EXACT THING! JAN 19TH 2007, WHILE DRIVING, MY CAR'S ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AND 30 SECONDS LATER THERE WAS A PLUME OF BLUE SMOKE ( THE BARTOW FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AS I WAS ON I-75 IN GEORGIA AND SOMEONE THOUGHT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE). THERE WAS NO FIRE, JUST SMOKE. I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE SERVICE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY TOLD ME I HAD THROWN A ROD. THEY CLAIM THE TWO ARE UNRELATED OCCURRENCES. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ON WEB SITES, THEY SEEM VERY RELATED TO ME. THE REPAIR IN SEPT WAS COSTLY, TO HAVE THE ROD THROWN 4 MONTHS LATER MAKES ME THINK THE 1AZFE ENGINE MAY HAVE SOME DEFECT AS WELL. THE CAR COULD NOT BE REPAIRED WITHOUT A TOTALLY NEW ENGINE. WE CHOSE NOT TO REPAIR IT. I BELIEVE TOYOTA SHOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS IN SEPT 06 AND THE TOW IN JAN 07, AS I AM CONVINCED THIS IS A DEFECT. I CAN PROVIDE ALL THE OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE RECORDS AS THIS HAS BEEN A WORK VEHICLE FOR ME. I WONDER IF OTHER TOYOTA ENGINES SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND REPORTED.

IN MAY OF 2001 I HAD MY 15,000 MILE SERVICE DONE AT COX TOYOTA AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE. IN JULY OF 2001, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THAT DAY,7/16/01, I WENT TO COX TOYOTA TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS JUST THE O2 SENSORS AND I DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT. BEING THAT I HAVE A DEGREE IN ENGLISH AND NOT AUTO MECHANICS, AND I WAS DEALING WITH THE DEALERSHIP, I TOOK THEIR WORD AND LEFT IT ALONE. THEY WERE ABLE TO TURN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OFF, EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T FIX ANYTHING. LATER IN 2001, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND I WENT TO TOYOTA OF DURHAM TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. I WENT TO THEM TWICE ABOUT IT AND THEY TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND IT WAS JUST THE LIGHT ITSELF. SO THE LIGHT JUST STAYED ON, AND SINCE I WAS TOLD TO BASICALLY IGNORE THE LIGHT BY TWO TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS, THAT'S WHAT I DID. NOW I AM HAVING A PROBLEM PASSING THE NC VEHICLE INSPECTION, BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. FRED ANDERSON TOYOTA IN RALEIGH, NC TOLD ME IN MAY OF 2004 THAT IT'LL COST 1,945.00 TO FIX MY CAR IN ORDER TO PASS INSPECTION, AND THE O2 SENSORS ARE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. MY CAR ISN'T PERFORMING AS IT SHOULD AND IT MAY HAVE PERMANENT ENGINE DAMAGE. I AM WORKING WITH A MECHANIC IN ELON, NC TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED. HE HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN WHAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE SENSORS, SO IT CAN PASS INSPECTION. IF COX TOYOTA HAD FIXED MY CAR WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THEM IN JULY 2001, I WOULDN'T BE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS NOW.  *AK",
