I was told it had passed a \"160 point inspection\" and was \"in great condition\".  However, when delivered to me the dealership knew it was not road worthy and in fact illegal to drive on public roads due to missing a third brake light, bad rear brakes were bad, the transmission had failed, the battery had failed, the shocks/struts had failed, and a live shotgun shell was rolling around under the drivers seat.  Both Toyota Motor Corporation and the dealership refused to address or correct these vehicle defects which could have resulted in a disastrous crash with injury/death to myself and children.

I ATTACHED THE CAR SEAT PER THE DIRECTIONS ON THE MANUAL (REAR FACING) TO THE REAR CAPTAIN SEAT OF MY 2008 TOYOTA SEQUOIA. I USED THE VERSA TETHER LOCATED ON THE REAR OF THE CAR SEAT TO MAKE THE CAR SEAT MORE SECURE AND SECURED THE REMAINING PORTION WITH THE TETHER. THE REMAINING TETHER PORTION EVENTUALLY BECAME LOOSE AND UNKNOWINGLY BECAME LODGED IN THE RIGHT REAR DOOR WITH THE END STICKING OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR. WHILE DRIVING ON A CITY STREET I HEARD A SOUND FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AT WHICH TIME THE TETHER GOT CAUGHT UNDERNEATH THE RIGHT REAR TIRE AND PULLED THE CAR SEAT (WITH MY SON IN IT) TOWARDS THE DOOR AND ALMOST PHYSICALLY HURT MY SON AND ALMOST DAMAGED THE CAPTAIN SEAT OF MY VEHICLE. FORTUNATELY MY SON WAS ONLY SCARED BY THE SITUATION AND NO PHYSICAL HARM WAS DONE TO HIM. THE CAPTAIN SEAT OF THE VEHICLE WAS SAVED BY THE SEAT PROTECTOR THAT HAS AN EXTREME INDENTION ON IT FROM THE FORCE THAT WAS APPLIED BY THE WHEEL CATCHING THE TETHER. THERE ARE ALSO MARKS IN THE PAINT AND SCRATCHES ON THE LOWER END OF THE RIGHT REAR DOOR WHERE THE TETHER WAS LODGED. THE VERSA TETHER ON THE REAR OF THE SEAT IS DANGEROUSLY LONG AND I WOULD SUGGEST SOME SORT OF FEATURE TO REDUCE THE LENGTH WITH SOMETHING BESIDES THE ELASTIC STRAP OR PROVIDE SEPARATE SIZES.  (RELATED VEHICLE INFORMATION: MODEL YEAR=2008, MAKE=TOYOTA, MODEL=SEQUOIA).  *TR",

ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK HE WAS DRIVING DOWNHILL ON ROUTE 74 (A VERY TREACHEROUS MOUNTAIN ROAD) AND THE RPM'S ON THE TOYOTA INCREASED AND WHEN HE SAW THEM GET OVER 3000 RPM'S HE TRIED TO BREAK.  THE BREAKS DID NOT WORK AND THE RPM'S KEPT RISING.   HE HIT THE BREAKS AGAIN AND THEY STILL DIDN'T WORK.  HE LAID ON THEM THE 3RD TIME AND THEY FINALLY KICKED IN.  WHEN HE GOT HOME HE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY ADVISED ME TO BRING THE CAR IN FIRST THING THE FOLLOWING DAY.  WE RAN INTO SEVERAL BAD EXPERIENCES WITH HOW THE DEALER HAS HANDLED US DURING THE WEEK. THEY STILL HAVE THE VEHICLE AND TODAY IS 3/25/10. WE ASKED THEM FOR A FULL PEDAL REPLACEMENT AS WE RESEARCHED IT ON LINE AND SAW THAT WE WERE NOT ALONE IN EXPERIENCING A PROBLEM EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR INITIAL \"RECALL FIX\".

THIS PLACES DRIVER AND PASSENGERS AT RISK.  NOT ALL PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS RISK AND THE OWNERS MANUAL EXPLAINS THIS POORLY.  MOST PEOPLE WILL CHANGE THE TIRE AND DRIVE ON  THE SPARE NORMALLY.  ALL VEHICLES SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH THE SAME BRAND AND SIZE OF TIRE.  IF THE SPARE NOT HAVING A TPMS INSTALLED IS THE ISSUE THEN SHOULD INSTALL A SENSOR IN THE SPARE OF OFFER TO INSTALL ONE FOR THE OWNER.  MY LEXUS HAD 5 TIRES ALL INCLUDING THE SPARE WAS THE SAME BRAND, SIZE AND HAD TPMS SENSORS INSTALLED IN ALL TIRES.  SOME HOW TOYOTA IS SAVING MONEY INSTALLING TWO DIFFERENT BRANDS AND SIZES OF TIRES ON THEIR VEHICLES. *TR",
