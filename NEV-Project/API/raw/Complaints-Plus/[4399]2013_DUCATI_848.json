AFTER APPROXIMATELY 4,500 MILES, I AM EXPERIENCING THE FUEL TANK DEFORMING AND EXPANDING. FURTHER RESEARCH REVEALS THAT THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT, AND THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN 2010 BETWEEN JONAS SUGARMAN (AND CLASS) AND DUCATI NORTH AMERICA (CALIFORNIA).    THIS SITUATION INTRODUCES A SAFETY ISSUE ON MANY LEVELS, INCLUDING FUEL LEAKAGE AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE HAZARD, STEERING LIMITATION WHERE THE TANK WILL COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE HANDLEBAR, AND SUDDEN SHIFTING OF THE WEIGHT OF A FULL FUEL TANK.    THIS IS A WELL-DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WHEREIN THE MANUFACTURER AS WELL AS THE DEALER KNOWINGLY SOLD DEFECTIVE VEHICLES.",
