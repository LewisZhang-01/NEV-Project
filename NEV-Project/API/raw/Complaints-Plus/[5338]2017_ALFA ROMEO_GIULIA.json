At that time the old, broken assembly will be available for inspection. This causes the light to not be directed to the roadway, causing dark spots and probably hits oncoming drivers in the eyes, blinding them. The dealer is clueless but the internet says that in Europe a circlip installation fix has been devised. The vehicle has not been investigated by the dealer.  I am waiting to receive the new assembly before allowing them to work on it. There were no warnings of any kind.  This car has automatic headlights so I never noticed it until I came home one night and lit up the trees as I came down the street and lit up my roof as I pulled in the driveway. From research I have discovered the mechanism is a ball and socket arrangement and the ball has a tendency to pop out of the socket due to vibration.

IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE. I'M AFRAID THAT I'M BREATHING IN ENGINE SMELLS THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. ALFA DOES NOT HAVE A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM AS OF YET. THEY HAVE ALREADY ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A FIX, BUT IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SEAL THE SMELL COMPLETELY, IT ONLY MINIMIZED THE SMELL AT BEST. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO 2 DEALERSHIPS NOW, AND BOTH HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ALL I'M TOLD IS ALFA ROMEO DOESN'T HAVE A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM YET. THE ISSUE HAS OCCURRED SINCE DAY 1 OF BUYING THE CAR. THE VEHICLE WAS SOLD TO ME WITH DOZENS OF ACTIVE RECALLS THAT HAD TO BE FIXED AFTER THE DAY OF PURCHASE. I'M NOT SURE IF THATS LEGAL, BUT IT'S JUST MORE THE NONSENSE I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH WHEN DEALING WITH THIS CAR MANUFACTURER. THE LOCAL DEALERSHIPS IN NYC AREA DO NOT EVEN KEEP A LOANER, NONE OF THEM!
