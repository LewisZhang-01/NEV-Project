The safety concern is that it occurred while in traffic and even occurred on an Interstate highway, while at momentary stop.   When reported to BMW, the failure was isolated to the mechatronics, the components   including electronic valve body, seals, etc. that control BMW automatic transmission functions.  This is not a failure of an eco-mode or other fuel efficiency option.   The item required costly repair, but confidence that a single part or system was isolated and repair is complete has not been confirmed.",

While his wife was driving 70 MPH, the passenger\u2019s side rear tire delaminated two tread belts and began whipping inside of the wheel well. Due to the failure, a friction fire ignited inside the wheel well which caused two rows of the tread to separate from the tire. The contact's wife pulled off to the shoulder and pressed the emergency button for immediate assistance. The authorities were dispatched to the scene. There was no injury reported. The vehicle was towed to the dealer and the contact made the service representative aware of the failure. The contact was provided an estimate of $5,000 in damages. The tire manufacturer was notified of the failure and the tire was sent to the Pirelli manufacturer for evaluation. The contact then received an email from the manufacturer stating they would not offer any assistance with the repair or replacement of the tire. The vehicle was repaired. The tire and vehicle failure mileages were approximately 26,000. The VIN was not available.",
