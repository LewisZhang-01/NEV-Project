The accelerator pedal was depressed but failed to respond. The contact stated that the vehicle lost motive power and remained at the bottom of the hill facing an incline, while there was oncoming traffic. The check engine warning light and other unknown warning lights illuminated. The contact engaged the Sport mode first gear and the vehicle moved slowly. The contact continued to depress the accelerator pedal but the vehicle failed to respond. The contact switched to the slow lane and drove to the top of the incline and made a left turn off the end of the bridge downhill. The vehicle rolled down, allowing him to veer to the side of the road. The contact parked the vehicle. Upon inspecting the vehicle, the contact noticed that the engine was running at 2,000 RPM, even though the vehicle had no motive power. The contact turned off and restarted the vehicle. The contact shifted to drive and low gear, and he was able to drive the vehicle to an independent mechanic. The independent mechanic diagnosed that the throttle position sensor had failed. The vehicle was repaired. The dealer and the manufacturer were not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 177,000.",

BOTH THE FOG LAMPS AND ALSO THE HIGH BEAMS WORK WELL, BUT THE LOW BEAM LIGHT (WHICH IS PRODUCED FROM A DIFFERENT BULB THAN THE HIGH BEAM) IS VERY INADEQUATE.  I HAVE REPLACED THE BULBS WITH HIGHER INTENSITY BULBS.  THIS OFFERED LITTLE IF ANY INCREASE IN LIGHTING.  I HAVE ALSO HAD THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM CHECKED TO ASSURE THE PROPER VOLTAGE IS BEING SUPPLIED.  GOOGLEING THIS PROBLEM HAS TOLD ME I'M NOT ALONE.  OTHER SUBARU OWNERS COMPLAIN OF THE SAME ISSUE.  HERE'S WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED AND DETERMINED TO BE THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS AN INNER REFLECTIVE CAVITY IN WHICH THE HEADLIGHT BULB IS HOUSED.  THE REFLECTION PROCESS WITHIN THIS HOUSING MAGNIFIES THE LIGHT PRODUCED BY THE BULB.  THIS PROCESS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A REFLECTIVE PRISM INSIDE A LIGHTHOUSE.  IN THE CASE OF OUR SUBARU, THE REFLECTIVE MATERIAL INSIDE OF THE HEADLIGHT BULB HOUSING HAS EITHER WORN AWAY OR BECOME CLOUDED TO THE DEGREE THAT THE LIGHT PRODUCED BY THE BULBS NO LONGER REFLECTS ADEQUATELY TO PRODUCE A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THESE HEADLIGHTS NEED TO EITHER BE REPLACED OR PERHAPS SOMEHOW REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE, OPENED UP AND THEN REPAIRED.  IN EITHER CASE THIS WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH MOST CONSUMERS WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO INCUR THE COST, THEREBY CONTINUING TO TAKE THEIR CHANCES DRIVING AT NIGHT WITH UNSATISFACTORY HEADLIGHTS.  MY QUESTIONS:  IS THIS CONSIDERED A SAFETY ISSUE?  IF SO, IS IT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM?  DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY CORRECTIONS?  I'D BE GRATEFUL FOR ANY HELP OR SUGGESTIONS YOU CAN OFFER TO ASSIST ME WITH THIS ISSUE. I FEEL THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, NOT JUST FOR MYSELF, BUT OTHER SUBARU OWNERS.

AT THE POINT OF THE ISSUE I WAS IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, THUS HAD USED MY BRAKES AT AN AVERAGE OF 12-18 TIMES SINCE I HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THAT MORNING. TRAFFIC WAS MAYBE MOVING AT 20-25 MILES AN HOUR, STOP AND GO. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO APPLY MY BRAKES AT A NORMAL PRESSURE AND THEY STARTED TO PULSE IN THE 'ANTI-LOCK' FASHION. THE PULSES WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LONG, BETWEEN BRAKING (PULSING), NOTHING LIKE I HAD EVER EXPERIENCE BEFORE WITH THIS CAR OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE. HOWEVER I KEPT MY FOOT APPLIED TO THE BRAKE AND DID NOT TRY TO PULSE IT MYSELF. BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR STOPPED IT HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I HAD ABOUT 1 AND + CAR LENGTHS BETWEEN US, AGAIN ONLY ROLLING AND ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT GET THE CAR STOPPED.   THE COLLISION WAS NOT HARD ENOUGH TO DEPLOY THE AIRBAG ON EITHER CARS. THE 2012 FORD ESCAPE IN FRONT HAD NEARLY NO DAMAGE TO THE REAR BUMPER, HOWEVER DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE FORD'S BUMPER TO MY GRILL, MY REPAIRS WERE $5,534.67. MY FEAR IS IT HAPPENING AGAIN. DUE TO THE MAKE OF THE CAR MY INSURANCE COMPANY CAN'T ACCESS THE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT. THUS THEY WILL NOT BE PART OF MY COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE FILED WITH SUBARU OF AMERICA, FILED 3/24/14. I DONE RESEARCH ON THE SUBRAU'S ABS SYSTEM. I FOUND THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISCONECTING THEIR ABS DUE TO THIS ISSUE. INCLUDING FINDING YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON HOW TO DO IT.  THE ISSUE IS OBVIOUS IF THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFER WITH THAN THE SUBARU FACTORY ABS SYSTEM. SUBARU'S CLAIM DEPARTMENT HAS NO INTEREST IN INVESTIGATING IT WITHOUT MY INSURANCE BEING PART OF THE CLAIM, EVEN THOUGHT I AM A CUSTOMER OF THEIR PRODUCT THAT IS DEFECTIVE. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A CUSTOMERS CLAIMS DEPARTMENT. WHO WILL HANDLE MY CLAIM IF THE NEXT INCIDENT I AM SEVERELY INJURED OR WORSE YET?  *TR",

STRANGE \"WANDERING\" BEST DESCRIBES IT.IT FEELS LIKE I'M DRIVING IN DEEP RUTS OF HEAVY ROAD SNOW THAT WANTS TO PULL THE CAR INTO THE RUTS BUT THE ROAD IS BARELY COVERED. ON TWO LANE ROADS IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR COULD EASILY CROSS THE CENTER LINE BECAUSE OF THIS ODD STEERING FEEDBACK I FEEL ON SLICK SNOW COVERED ROAD CONDITIONS. I DON'T FEEL IT IN RAIN CONDITIONS. IT HAS \"NEVER\" FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE.  THE REAR STRUTS WERE REPLACE LAST SUMMER WITH OEM STRUTS. THE CAR HAS NEVER HAD AN ALIGNMENT BUT HAS ALWAYS TRACKED DOWN THE ROAD VERY STRAIGHT. TIRE WEAR IS EVEN AND TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED MULTIPLE TIMES. TIRES ARE BRIDGESTONE TURANZA SERENITY WITH 66K AND BEEN THROUGH 3 WINTERS BEFORE WITH NO HANDLING ISSUE.  ONCE I NOTICED ON THIS SITE THAT MANY OUTBACK OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOM, I KNEW I NEEDED TO GET THIS POSTED IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.

A CAR SHOULD NEVER DISPLAY THE KIND OF HANDLING ISSUES THAT MAKES IT FEEL UNSAFE TO DRIVE IN LIGHT WINTER CONDITIONS.   P.S.

THIS OCCURS WITH NO CROSS-WIND, NO ACCELERATION, NO CORNERING OR BRAKING, ON FLAT STRAIGHT ICY ROADS WHILE DRIVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED. THE SIDEWAYS SLIP IS SEVERE ENOUGH THAT YOU FEEL YOU MAY LOSE CONTROL AND LEAVE THE ROAD.  THE ONLY FIX IS TO SLOW DOWN TO 40 MPH OR LESS, WHILE OTHER CARS ARE PASSING AT 60 MPH OR MORE.     AFTER SEVERAL OCCURRENCES, ALWAYS ON ICY OR SLUSHY ROADS, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SUBARU DEALER, WHO PERFORMED AN ALIGNMENT. THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE CAR HAD POSITIVE TOE-IN OF 0.23 DEGREES (FRONT LEFT), 0.24 DEGREES (FRONT RIGHT), 0.22 DEGREES (REAR LEFT) AND 0.44 DEGREES (REAR RIGHT).    TOO MUCH TOE-IN, I'M TOLD, CAN CAUSE EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR AND CAN ALSO CAUSE POOR HANDLING ON ICY ROADS.  PLEASE CONSIDER THAT COMPLAINTS FOR BOTH THESE ISSUES MAY HAVE A COMMON CAUSE.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT TOE-IN INCREASES OVER TIME WITH SUBARU OUTBACKS, AND THAT TOE-IN ALSO INCREASES WHEN THERE IS MORE WEIGHT IN THE BACK END OF THE CAR.    THE SUBARU OUTBACK DYNAMICALLY SHIFTS POWER TO NON-SLIPPING WHEELS WHEN ONE OR MORE WHEELS LOSES TRACTION, AND APPORTIONS POWER 60/40 FAVORING THE REAR WHEELS.  COULD THESE FACTORS, ALONG WITH EXCESSIVE TOE-IN, CREATE THE KIND OF DANGEROUS FLOATING ON ICY ROADS THAT MANY OUTBACK OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED?    PLEASE, PLEASE INVESTIGATE. *TR",

IT'S LIKE SOMETHING SHUTS OFF THE PROJECTED LIGHT AHEAD AND  THE ROAD BECOMES SEVERELY DARKENED.   HOWEVER, WHEN I TURN ON MY HIGHBEAMS THE ENTIRE ROAD FRONT AND SIDES ARE ADEQUATELY LIT.  I FEEL THIS COULD BE A PENITENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE DRIVING IN FOG,   HEAVY RAIN, OR SNOW.   HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN A SAFE CONDITION IF YOUR FORWARD LIGHT IS ESSENTIALLY CUT OFF  BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATION OF THE PROJECTOR DESIGN OF THE HEADLIGHT?  I HAVE EXPRESSED MY CONCERN TO SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ACCORDING TO PERSON I SPOKE TO.  I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD WITH MY CONCERNS.   APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE SUBARU MECHANIC I SPOKE TO TODAY, OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 2006 TRIBECA WHICH HAS THE SAME HEADLIGHT SET UP.  SINCERELY,  AP GULLA.  *NM",
