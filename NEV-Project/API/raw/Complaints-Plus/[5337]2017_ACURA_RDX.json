THE SHIFTS SEEM MUCH HARSHER ESPECIALLY WHEN DOWNSHIFTING.  WHEN THE CAR SLOWS DOWN, THERE IS A SUDDEN JERK AND A NOTICEABLE DROP IN SPEED.

THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AS THE SUDDEN JERK & SLOW-DOWNS ARE UNEXPECTED FOR DRIVERS BEHIND ME, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE NO VISUAL INDICATORS/WARNINGS (E.G. BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T COME WHEN THIS HAPPENS).  PLUS NOT TO MENTION A WASTE OF MY GAS AS I HAVE TO PRESS THE GAS TO GET IT BACK UP THE CRUISING SPEED NEEDED.
