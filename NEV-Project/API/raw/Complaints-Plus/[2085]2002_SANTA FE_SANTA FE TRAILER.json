MY CONCERN IS THAT THE ROCK CAME COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, HIT THE DASHBOARD, & LANDED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR.  FORTUNATELY MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEATED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SAW IT COMING & IN A SPLIT SECOND WAS ABLE TO COVER HER FACE & LEAN TOWARDS THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  IF THAT ROCK HAD HIT HER IT WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUSLY INJURED HER OR WORSE.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE ROCK CAME COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD & WONDER IF THEIR IS A DEFECT IN THE SANTA FE.  THE GLASS TECHNICIAN THAT  REPAIRED THE WINDSHIELD SAID THAT ROCK SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH & HE ALSO SAID THAT THE HE FIXES A GREAT NUMBER OF SANTA FE WINDSHIELD.  I REALLY THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO.  I HAVE EMAILED HYUNDAI & THEY BASICALLY SAID THEY WOULD ENTER IT INTO THAT DATABASE.  THAT WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
