THREE WEEKS LATER, SEPTEMBER 18TH, THEY SAID IT WAS DONE, AND WE COULD GET IT BACK.  WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SHOP TO PICK IT UP, WE DISCOVERED THAT THEY LIED TO US AND  THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION HAS AT LEAST 67,000 AND THE NAME ON THE RECEIPT SAID JERRY'S AUTO CLINIC IN CALDWELL, IDAHO.  BOTH THE SHOP AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WERE RUDE TO US, LIED TO US, AND GAVE US DEATH THREATS.

I CHECKED THE OTHER SIDE AND IT WAS FINE. I EASED IT DOWN THE RAMP AND ONTO THE LOT I WORK AT (I WORK FOR MODOT, RIGHT NEXT TO THE RAMP)I CALLED TO ASK THE DEALER ABOUT IT AND I ALSO CALLED FORD. NEITHER SEEMED VERY INTERESTED. I HAVE TALKED TO SIX DIFFERENT MECHANICS AND NONE OF THEMHAVE EVER SEEN THIS PART FAIL UNLESS THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN WRECKED OR DRIVEN VERY ROUGHLY! MY TRUCK LOOKS LIKE NEW AND IT HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED LIKE THAT. I WASH IT REGULARLY, SO RUST IS NOT A PROBLEM. ONLY THE ONE PART FAILED, NOT BOTH OR SEVERAL OTHER PARTS OF THE SUSPENSION! I EXPLAINED TO THE DEALER THAT I HAD TOLD THEM IT PULLED TO THE RIGHT WHEN I HAD HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE BEFORE BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE ALL ALONG AND WHEN IT DISINTEGRATED, I WAS LUCKY THAT NOONE WAS HURT OR KILLED WHEN THE TRUCK JERKED TO THE RIGHT! THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR A PART LIKE THIS FAILING UNDER ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE THE PART AND PICTURES OF IT. I INTEND TO HAVE IT TESTED IN A LAB AT ONE OF THE LOCAL COLLEGES. THANK YOU.",

THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE MATERIAL THE LENS WAS MADE OFF, AND THE INABILTY TO KEEP THE INSIDE OF THE LENS CLEAN.  THE COST TO REPLACE THESE LENS COVERS ARE $75 EACH.  IF THIS WAS A TRADITION SEALED BEAM LIGHT, THE COST TO REPLACE WOULD BE $10.  THE DETERIATION IS ALSO VERY SUTTLE.  YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT THE LUMENS THE LIGHT ARE PROVIDING IS BEING REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE SUTTLE CHANGE IN THE LENS COVER OVERTIME.  THE LENS COVER CHANGES SO THAT IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THE HALOGEN BULB PROVIDES TO LIGHTING THE ROAD.  I NOTICED THIS CHANGE WHEN I WENT FROM DIRVING THE 92 CROWN VICTORIA TO MY NEW DODGE DACODA ON SOME BACK ROADS ON VERY DARK NIGHTS.  I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OF THE LENS COVERS NEED TO ADDRESS TO ASSURE THAT THEY WILL NOT DETERIORATE OVER TIME AND CAUSE THIS VISIBITY PROBLEM,  FORD SHOULD BE MADE RESPONSIBLE TO INSURE THE PLASTIC FOR THESE LENS ARE AS GOOD AS THE GLASS WAS FOR THE SEALED BEAM LIGHTS.  I KNOW THE DOT ALLOWED THE CAR MANUFACTURER THE ABILITY  NOT TO USE THE SEALED BEAM TO PROVIDE THE BENEFIT OF THE HALOGEN BULBS BRIGHTNESS, LESS ENERGY USED PER LUMIN, AND TO ALLOW A MORE GAS EFFENTS DESIGNS.  THEY SHOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A PRODUCT THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THE GLASS ON THE SEAL BEAMS.  PLEASE CALL ME AT MY WORK PHONE TO PROVIDE ME SOME FEEDBACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
