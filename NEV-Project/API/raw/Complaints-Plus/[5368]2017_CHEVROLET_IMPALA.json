THE SPARK PLUG TUBES ARE PERMANENTLY SEALED INTO THE HEAD AND ARE NOT REPLACEABLE. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IMMEDIATELY. WE JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE AND I AM BEING TOLD THAT THIS REPAIR IS GOING TO COST $3,000-$4,000 TO FIX, WHICH I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR.

        "summary": "GOOD MORNING,    I'M UNSURE OF HOW OFTEN THIS IS HAPPENING, BUT I BELIEVE IT COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE RECENT TAKATA AIR BAG ISSUES.  I HAD (BUT HAVE SINCE SOLD) A 2017 CHEVROLET IMPALA THAT MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING ON JULY 4, 2018 WHEN A WARNING LIGHT AND SOUND ON THE DASHBOARD INDICATED THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE AIR BAG SYSTEM.  WE ALSO RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM ONSTAR THAT DAY INDICATING WE SHOULD TAKE THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER BY THE NEXT DAY.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO WATSON CHEVROLET IN TUCSON THAT AFTERNOON.  THE VEHICLE WAS DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A FAULTY AIRBAG SENSOR WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1100.00 WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY SINCE OUR VEHICLE HAD OVER 36,000 MILES ON IT.  I WORK AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD BY OUR SERVICE MANAGER THAT THIS SORT OF ISSUE IS COVERED BY FORD MOTOR CORP. UNDER THEIR POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  I DON'T KNOW THE REASON FOR THIS, BUT I WOULD GUESS IT'S BECAUSE FORD FEELS IT WOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE IF REPAIRS WEREN'T MADE BY A CUSTOMER DUE TO COST.  WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS, BUT I WONDER HOW MANY VEHICLES ARE ON THE ROAD THAT HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE BUT HAVE GONE UNREPAIRED DUE TO COST.  I ALSO WONDER IF THERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH ISSUES WITH THE SENSORS TO WARRANT A RECALL.    THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.",
