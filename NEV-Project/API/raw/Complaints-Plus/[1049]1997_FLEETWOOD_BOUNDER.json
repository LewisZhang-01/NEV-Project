I PURCHASED MY 1997 FLEETWOOD BOUNDER NEW IN 1997 AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET FLEETWOOD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW IN MY MOTORHOME IS SORELY INADEQUATE. THEY MERELY PLACED A DECAL THAT READS \"FIRE EXIT\" ON A STANDARD WINDOW AND EXPECT THAT TO SUFFICE. A NORMAL FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW HAS TWO RED HANDLES THAT SECURE THE WINDOW FRAME DURING NORMAL OPERATION AND CAN ALSO BE TURNED TO UNLATCH THE WINDOW FRAME FOR EGRESS IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE.  I CONTACTED FLEETWOOD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THEY HAD ME GO TO A LOCAL AUTHORIZED FLEETWOOD REPAIR FACILITY WHERE A SERVICE MANAGER TOOK PICTURES OF MY WINDOW AND SENT THEM TO FLEETWOOD. FLEETWOOD RESPONDED TO THEM , AND THEY TO ME, THAT I HAVE THE CORRECT CONFIGURATION. LAST WEEK I WENT TO A RV SHOW WHERE THERE WERE NEW AND USED BOUNDERS ON SALE. THE NEW BOUNDER HAD THE CORRECT FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW (RED RELEASE HANDLES). IN ANOTHER BOUNDER (USED) THAT WAS A YEAR OR SO NEWER THAN MINE THERE WAS NO REAL FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW. IT WAS UN-EQUIPPED, JUST LIKE MINE. IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE, AN OLDER COUPLE SUCH AS MY WIFE AND I, WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY EXITING THE VEHICLE. I FEAR THAT WE WOULD SURELY SUSTAIN SEVERE BURNS AT THE VERY LEAST. SINCE THERE WERE OTHER MOTORHOMES IN MY MOTORHOME'S ERA WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, MANY PEOPLE COULD BE AT RISK.

WITH 12,200 MILES ON THE ODOMETER I WAS DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WHEN I CAME TO TO THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE HIGHWAY AND THE BRIDGE, THERE WAS A LEVEL CHANGE BETWEEN THE BRIDGE AND THE HIGHWAY.  I FELT A SMALL JAR AND IMMEDIATELY THE FRONT END WENT INTO A VIOLENT BACK AND FORTH VIBRATION WITH LOTS OF AMPLITUDE.  I THOUGHT THE MOTORHOME WAS GOING TO LEAVE THE FRAME.  THE BACK AND FORTH MOTION DID NOT STOP UNTIL I CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  ABOUT 10-20 MILES FURTHER,  THE SAME CONDITIONS RESULTED IN THE SAME VIOLENT REACTION.  THE MOTORHOME NOW HAS 15,200 MILE ON IT AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE PROBLEM,  HOWEVER I AM AWARE THE PROBLEM EXISTS AND AM VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN I APPROACH A BRIDGE.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF A CHUCKHOLE IS ENCOUNTERED.  I LIVE IN FEAR THAT I WILL LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND WILL CAUSE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.  IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO HOLD ONTO THE STEERING WHEEL.  IF MY WIFE WAS DRIVING IT'S DOUBTFUL SHE COULD HAVE HANDLED IT.  I TALKED WITH A FORD REPRESENTATIVE IN ARIZONA, PHONE 1-800-444-3311 EXT 261 AND HE TOLD ME TO HAVE THE WHOLE FRONT END INSPECTED AND TO HAVE THE STEERING STABILIZER REPLACED.  THIS PROBLEM OCCURED AT 12,200 MILES.  WHAT COULD WEAR AT 12,200 MILES TO CAUSE SUCH A MAJOR PROBLEM?  DOES THIS MEAN I SHOULD HAVE THE STEERING STABILIZER REPLACED EVERY 10,000 MILES?  OTHER MOTORHOME OWNERS WITH FORD CHASSIS HAVE HAD THE EXACT EXPERIENCE.  TO LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES IS SCARRY AS IT'S USUALLY SO IDENTICAL TO WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.  I FEEL WHAT THE FORD REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME IS A SMOKESCREEN.  THERE IS AN AFTER-MARKET PRODUCT CALLED A DAVIS TRUTRAC BAR THAT KEEPS THE AXLE FROM SWINGING BACK AND FORTH,THUS ELIMINATING THE PROBLEM.  IT COSTS $332.10.
