I TRIED TO KEEP THEWHEELSSTRAIGHT AND SLOW DOWN GRADUALLY BUT THE REAR END SLOWLY KICKED OUT TO THE LEFT SIDE. BY THE TIME I KNEW IT I WAS DIRECTLY FACING THE RIGHT-SIDE GUARDRAIL AND MOMENTS LATER THE VEHICLE TAPPED THE GUARDRAIL JUST ENOUGH TO BUST THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND PEEL BACK THEHOODA FEW NOTCHES.&#8232;&#8232;THE VEHICLE CAME TO A REST AFTER DOING A NEAR-180 DEGREE TURN AND ENDED UP FACING ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THEENGINEWAS STILL RUNNING PERFECTLY FINE WITH NO DASH WARNINGLIGHTSSO I TRIED TO MOVE IT IN 1STGEAR, 2NDGEAR, AND REVERSE, BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT BUDGE! I THEN DIALED 911 AND EVACUATED MY GIRLFRIEND AND I FROM THE CAR. &#8232;&#8232;STATE TROOPERS ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER AND WE TRIED PUSHING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL BUT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE AN INCH. WHEN THE WRECKER ARRIVED AND TRIED TO PULL THE CAR ONTO THE FLATBED, WE FOUND THAT BOTH REAR WHEELS WERE LOCKED AND IMMOBILE. AT NO POINT DID THE DASHBOARD EVER SHOW ANY SIGN OF ANY SYSTEM FAILURE. THANKFULLY IMPACT WAS NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO DEPLOY AIRBAGS.&#8232;&#8232;THE STATE TROOPER'S REPORT SAYS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT DUE TO DRIVER'S ERROR AND I AM CONVINCED THAT A FAILURE ONBOARD THE VEHICLE OCCURRED THAT CAUSED THE REAR WHEELS TO LOCK. THE CAR HAS RECEIVED EVERY REQUIREDSERVICEAT THEAUDIDEALERSHIP IN EL PASO TX AND IT WAS GARAGED MUCH OF ITS LIFE. ALTHOUGH 5 YEARS OLD, THE CAR ONLY HAS 13,000 MILES.    &#8232;I HAVE ALREADY FILED AN INSURANCE CLAIM AND CONTACTEDAUDIOF AMERICA TO RAISE SOME ATTENTION SO AS TO LOOK FURTHER INTO WHAT HAPPENED. I AM CURRENTLY AWAITING A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS FROM THE AUDI DEALERSHIP IN RICHMOND VA AND THEN WILL FOLLOW UP WITH AUDI CORPORATE.",
