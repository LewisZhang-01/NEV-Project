WHEN I TOOK MY F150 TO THE FORD SERVICE MECHANICS IN OCTOBER, I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS THE FILLER NECK FOR THE TANK THAT WAS CORRODED AND THAT THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.  THEY COULD REPLACE THE STRAPS, BUT ONE OF THE STRAPS WAS BY THE SKID PLATE AND IT WOULD DO NO GOOD TO REPLACE THAT ONE, AS THE SKID PLATE WAS HOLDING THE TANK, AND THE OTHER STRAP WAS NOT IN BAD CONDITION.  I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FILLER TANK ON MY OWN WITHOUT COVERAGE FROM FORD. AND....BY THE WAY....THE FILLER NECK IS NO LONGER MANUFACTURED, SO THE FORD SERVICE GROUP WOULD HAVE TO ORDER ANOTHER COMPONENT AND DO SOME FABRICATION TO REPLACE MY FILLER NECK. I ASKED THE SERVICE TECH WHY MY GAS TANK WASN'T CORRODED, NOR WERE THE STRAPS VERY CORRODED, BUY MY FILLER NECK, WHICH WAS UP UNDER THE TRUCK BOX BODY WAS THE PART THAT WAS CORRODED AND LEAKING.

I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE BOTH STRAPS MYSELF SO I THOUGHT I WAS GOOD. I DID NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE BOLTS BECAUSE THE BOLT MEETS THE FRAME OF THE TRUCK BEFORE YOU CAN OVER TIGHTEN THE BOLT.    HOWEVER, A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER I NOTICED MY TANK WAS LEAKING IN THE AREA WHERE THE BOTTOM OF THE FUEL TANK IS SHAPED TO ACCEPT THE STRAP. I REMOVED THE STRAP IT APPEARED THAT THE RUSTING PROCESS HAD WEAKEN THE BOTTOM OF THE FUEL TANK IN THE AREA OF THE STRAP.    I HAD TO ORDER A NEW FUEL TANK FROM AN ONLINE SUPPLIER TO SAVE MONEY(PARTS TRAIN) AND WENT BACK TO THE FORD DEALER AND THEY AGREED FOR A FEE TO INSTALL  THE NEW AFTERMARKET FUEL TANK.    I DID HAVE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO REPLACE A FUEL TAKEN SENSOR ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THAT WAS RUSTED AND WOULD NOT BE REUSABLE WITH THE NEW FUEL TANK.

I FOUND THAT IF I QUICKLY SHUT OFF THE IGNITION THE (ELECTRONIC) ABS WOULD BE DEACTIVATED AND THE TRUCK WOULD STOP NORMALLY.    3. CHANGING FRONT BEARINGS AND ASSOCIATED SPEED SENSORS SOLVED THE PROBLEM. DEALER PART AND INSTALLATION WAS AROUND $1200, BUT GENERIC PARTS WERE AVAILABLE THAT SHAVED SEVERAL HUNDRED OFF THIS TOTAL REPAIR COST. *TR",

THE TRUCK WAS PULLED OVER AND INSPECTED THERE WAS NO APPARENT ISSUE WITH THE ACCELERATOR PETAL.  IT MOVED EASILY AND NORMALLY. THE TRUCK WAS STARTED AND TEST DROVE, AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE CRUISE CONTROL WORKED NORMALLY.  WE CONTINUED DRIVING WITHOUT ANY FURTHER INCIDENT.

THE FIRST PLACE I LOOKED WAS THE BRAKE SAFETY SWITCH LOCATED ON THE TOP OF THE BRAKE PEDAL ITSEL. EVERY THING CHECKED OUT FINE. THAT IS WERE I HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM BEFORE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS  ANOTHER BROKEN WIRE BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. SO I DECIDED TO CHECK BRAKE FLUID LEVEL,AND NOTICED THAT THE ELECTRICAL PLUG LOCATED AT THE FRONT OF THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER HAD CAUGHT FIRE AND MELTED THE ENTIRE PLASTIC PLUG AND  WIRES. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT I FEEL  VERY LUCKY IT WENT OUT BY ITSELF!I LIVE IN THE COLORADO MOUNTAINS AND COULD NOT IMAGINE THE DAMAGE IT COULD OF CAUSED IF IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL, AS IT WAS PARKED BY TREES ,SHED, JET SKIS,ETC. AT THIS TIME I AM GOING TO TRY TO REPLACE THE PLUG AND OR WIRING HARNESS AND THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENT ON FRONT OF MASTER CYLINDER THAT I BELIEVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SMALL FIRE. I WILL CALL FORD DEALER SHIP IN MORNING TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY INFO ON PROBLEM. I HAVE ALL OLD PARTS AND HAVE DOCUMENTED THE ISSUE WITH PICTURES. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH BOX IS LOCATED ABOUT 3 INCHES FROM THE ELECTRICAL BRAKE SWITCH THAT CAUGHT FIRE.

THERE WERE NO PRIOR SYMPTOMS OR ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS LEADING UP TO THIS SO I CHECKED THE INTERNET TO LOOK INTO IT. I CAME TO FIND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO AND THAT FORD KNEW ALL ABOUT IT! MY TRUCK HAS ONLY 116,000 ORIGINAL MILES IN 10 YEARS! NOT ABUSED.  APPARENTLY, FORD ISSUED A RECALL ON A FAULTY GASKET THAT ALLOWED COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE PLUGS/OIL BUT IT WAS NOT A RECALL I WAS OFFERED OR TOLD OF WHEN WE ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS ON THE VEHICLE OVER THE YEARS! TODAY I FOUND 2 MORE RECALLS 4 IT ON THEIR SITE (NOT THE GASKET 1) THAT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME OF ON 4/7/08 WHEN ASKED 4 A VIN WHEN CALLING ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I ASKED 4 THE PRICE OF A REBUILT ENGINE AS THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T FIX A ROD & QUOTED $5,500. WHEN I ASKED IF IT WAS FOR EVERYTHING, HE REPLIED \"NO - PARTS CAN REALLY ADD UP, HONEY\"!  I TOOK GREAT CARE OF THIS TRUCK! I OPTED TO TOW IT TO ANOTHER ACCREDITED SHOP SINCE THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME A TOTAL PRICE. NOT INCLUDING 2 TOWS & PAYING $150 TO DIAGNOSE I WAS QUOTED A MIN OF $7,300 TO FIX W/REBUILD +/- 12%.   WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY 4 SOMETHING THAT IS FORDS FAULT? THEY MADE A FAULTY ENGINE & LEFT THOUSANDS OF US TO PAY 4 IT! I CAN EITHER BUY A NEW CAR OR WALK NOW!

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY, PUTTING THE FIRE OUT.  THEIR ASSESSMENT WAS IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL SHORT WHICH HAD CAUSED THE FIRE.  THE FIRE CAUSED THE HOOD HYDRAULIC LIFT TO EXPLODE LIKE A ROCKET, HITTING THE WINDSHIELD, CRACKING IT AND THEN SHOOTING OFF INTO THE YARD.  THE FRAMES INSIDE THE ENGINE HOUSING BY THE DRIVERS TIRE BURNT THE HOUSING COMPLETELY AWAY.  THE WIRING HAS BEEN COMPLETELY BURNED AND MELTED AWAY INSIDE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  ALL THE PLASTIC FLUID CONTAINERS MELTED, THE ENTIRE ENGINE HOUSING, ENGINE AND ALL ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS UNDER THE HOOD WERE BURNED UP OR DAMAGED IN SOME WAY BY THIS FIRE.

IN LATE MARCH OR EARLY APRIL OF THIS YEAR THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE, A 4.2 L 6 CYLINDER MOTOR SELF DESTRUCTS.  ON THE MORNING IN QUESTION, I WENT OUT AND ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE.  THE MOTOR TURNED OVER VERY SLUGGISHLY AS IF THE BATTERY WAS LOW.  WHEN THE MOTOR STARTED, IT MADE A TERRIBLE RACKET AND BLEW A CHUNK OF THE ENGINE BLOCK OUT APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF MY THUMB.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED, I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET ONLY TO FIND THAT 1997 4.2 L FORD MOTORS HAVE A DEFECTIVE GASKET WHICH ALLOWS WATER TO FLOW INTO THE CYLINDERS.  THE GASKET HAD FAILED AND ALLOWED WATER TO LEAK INTO THE CYLINDER(S) OVERNIGHT CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO HYDROLOCK AND \"BLOW UP\". FORD HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS, AND EVEN SENT OUT NUMEROUS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS REGARDING THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE EVEN FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THEY MAY SENT OUT A FEW RECALL NOTICES, BUT NOT TO EVERY OWNER.  HUNDREDS OF '97 F-150 OWNERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM, AND THEY, LIKE ME, CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE APPROXIMATELY $5,000 TO REPAIR THEIR MISTAKE.  I CURRENTLY OWE ABOUT $5,000 ON THIS VEHICLE, WHICH AT THIS TIME IS ONLY AN EXPENSIVE LAWN ORNAMENT.   FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NOT FIRE OR INJURIES WHEN THIS OCCURRED, BUT THEY COULD HAVE.  I'M CERTAIN THAT FORD NEVER REPLACED THE GASKET ON THIS VEHICLE, AS THE ONLY RECALL \"STICKER\" IS ONE FOR THE ENGINE COMPUTER.  AS FOR BEING TOO OLD TO BE RECALLED, SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR A WIRING PROBLEM ON IT.  CERTAINLY FORD SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL, OR AT LEAST PAY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED. THE INCIDENT DATE IS ONLY APPROXIMATE, AS I CANNOT RECALL THE EXACT DAY THAT IT HAPPENED.  *TR",

BOTH THESE RECALLS INVOLVED SOME FACET OF THE TRANSMISSION LINKAGE BETWEEN THE STEERING COLUMN AND THE TRASMISSION HOUSING, JUST AS MINE DID.

THE TOP BOLT CAME LOOSE AND FELL OUT, WHILE THE SECOND BOLT WAS VERY LOOSE, IN FACT, THE WHOLE ARM WAS READY TO FALL OUT.  THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF MY PROBLEM.

MONDAY COMES, AND I GO TO START IT TO GO TO WORK, AND - HYDRO LOCK AGAIN. SO, I TAKE MY WIFE'S CAR TO WORK, AND CALLED THEM FROM THERE, AND TOLD THEM WHAT IT WAS DOING. THEY WERE THERE WITHIN A HALF HOUR TO GET IT. THIS TIME I GET A CALL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER, AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE PUT HIS BEST TECHNICIAN ON IT, AND WOULD CALL. WHEN HE CALLED, HE TOLD ME THAT THE HEAD GASKETS WERE LEAKING, AND LETTING COOLANT INTO THE CYLINDERS. I SAID TO GO AHEAD & FIX IT. THEN THEY CALLED ME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THAT THEY FOUND THAT THE LOWER INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS CRACKED, AND LETTING COOLANT POUR INTO THE CYLINDERS. I ASKED ABOUT GETTING A USED INTAKE MANIFOLD, AND HE SAID THEY WOULD LOOK FOR ONE, AND THEY DID FIND ONE.  PLUS, THEY PUT IN A NEW THERMOSTAT. *JB",

THE INDICATIONS OF FAILURE ARE LOSS OF ENGINE COOLANT WITH NO VISIBLE EXTERNAL LEAK, AND COOLANT IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER.  2: FAILURE AND IT'S CONSEQUENCES  THIS DEFECT ALLOWS COOLANT LEAKAGE INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER, CAUSING A HYDRAULIC LOCKING CONDITION WHICH WILL BREAK/BEND ONE OR MORE CONNECTING RODS.

ON MAY 16 I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND HEARD A RAUCOUS NOISE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  ON MAY 17TH I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO AUTO SPECIALTIES, AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP.  THEY IDENTIFIED THE NOISE AS A BENT CONNECTING ROD.  THEY DISCOVERED STEAM COMING FROM THE TAILPIPE AND BELIEVE COOLANT SEEPED INTO THE CYLINDER THROUGH A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  I ASKED HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED.  THEY SAID PROBABLY OVERHEATING.  YET, IN THE ENTIRE TIME I OWNED IT, THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAS NEVER REGISTERED HIGH, NO STEAM AROSE FROM THE ENGINE AREA.  I HAVE ALWAYS CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3K MILES.  I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED CORRECT FLUID LEVELS.  I HAVE NEVER TOWED ANYTHING WITH THIS TRUCK AND NEVER CARRIED ANYTHING MORE THAN A HALF-TON LOAD.  I ALWAYS LET IT WARM UP AND DRIVE IT GENTLY WHILE IT IS WARMING UP.  IN ADDITION, THE TRUCK SPEED CONTROL DEVICE WAS REPLACED BY THE LOCAL FORD DEALER ON SEPT. 14, 2005.  IN THEIR INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE THEY UNCOVERED NO PROBLEMS WITH COOLING OR OVERHEATING.  THIS IS THE FIRST FORD I HAVE OWNED, THE FIRST AMERICAN CAR.  I HAVE OWNED 1 MITSUBISHI AND 2 TOYOTA PICKUPS WHICH I BOUGHT SECOND HAND.  I OWNED THEM UNTIL THEY HAD OVER 125K MILES AND THEY NEEDED NO REPAIRS OTHER THAN NORMAL MAINTENANCE.  I HAVE DRIVEN A PRE-OWNED INTEGRA TO OVER 140K MILES WITHOUT PROBLEMS AND A HONDA CIVIC WHICH I DROVE FROM 60K-120K WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PROBLEM. A TRUCK WITH 90K MILES SHOULD NOT NEED A NEW ENGINE.  BY JUST ABOUT ANY MAKER STANDARDS THE ENGINE SHOULD LAST OVER 200K MILES.    I HAVE CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH  CHARLES WHO SAID FORD WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEM, SINCE THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT PART OF A RECALL.  SHOULDN'T FORD BE CONCERNED ABOUT A LEMON, EVEN IF IT IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM?  I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD REPLACE THE ENGINE, SINCE ITS FAILURE IS PREMATURE. *JB",

I TOOK MY SON TO WORK ON THURSDAY AND IT WAS STILL MISSING. WHEN ON THE FREEWAY, I GOT IT UP TO 65/70 MPH WHEN IT JUST STARTED SLOWLY DOWN. I COULD NO LONGER GIVE IT ANY GAS. I WAS ABLE TO PULL ONTO A LARGE SHOULDER WHERE I HAD IT TOWED INTO A TRANSMISSION SHOP I TRUSTED. ON INSPECTION, THE TRANSMISSION WAS FLOODED WITH WATER AND COOLANT AS WELL AS THE ENGINE DUE TO A FAULTY RADIATOR. I HAD REPLACED THE RADIATOR APRIL 11, 2005. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST RADIATOR REPLACED. THIS WAS THE 4TH RADIATOR. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT INSTALLED THE RADIATOR AND WAS TOLD THAT MY ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED. I'M WAITING FOR A CALL BACK WITH AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY. I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN ENGINE BREAKDOWN WHICH WOULD COST ME, TO FIND OUT WHY IT FAILED. WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THE WHOLE COOLING SYSTEM IN GENERAL SINCE 1999. RANGING FROM CHANGED HEAD GASKETS, HEATER CORES, RADIATORS, ETC. IT HAS BECOME APPARENT FROM READING ON THE FIGHT BACK SITE: [HTTP://FORUMS.TREEMEDIA.COM/FB/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?P=836&PAGE=2&PP=15] THAT THIS A COMMON UNRESOLVED ISSUE WITH THE FORD COMPANY. APPARENTLY THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT THAT HAS YET TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I COUNTED OUT 226 COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA SITE UNDER ENGINE AND ENGINE: COOLING THROUGH  E/E:C:EXSYS:MANIFOLD/HEADER/MUFFLER/TAILPIPE. I'VE ALWAYS TRUSTED THE FORD COMPANY AS MY FATHER-IN-LAW RETIRED FROM THERE. WE ALWAYS HAD GREAT SERVICE UNTIL HIS PARTICULAR DEALERSHIP CLOSED. I AM NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT ANY ONE DEALER AS I'VE BEEN TO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO SERVICE MY CAR WHEN THEY CLOSED. THIS SEEMS TO BE A MANUFACTURE RESPONSIBILITY  *NM",

MY OTHER VEHICLE WAS PARKED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK, MEANING THAT THE GAS TANK WAS ABOUT 1-2 FEET AWAY FROM THE TRUCK. THE FIRST THING I DID WAS CALLED 911 WHILE RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO PUT CLOTHES ON. MY HUSBAND WAS OUTSIDE WITH A WATER HOSE TRYING TO PUT A HUGE FIRE OUT. WHICH KNOWING IN MY MIND THAT ANY MOMENT WE COULD ALL BLOW UP. BY THIS TIME I HURRIED AND GOT MY 5 MONTH OLD BABY, AND MY OTHER 2 CHILDREN AND RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE.  WHILE MY HUSBAND IS STILL TRYING TO HOLD A HUGE FIRE DOWN WITH A HOSE PIPE, I AM WATCHING THE TOP OF MY CARPORT BURN THE FIRE DEPT. ARRIVES AND TAKES CONTROL OF EVERYTHING. (GREAT JOB MCFD YOU ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED) AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT. I THANKED  THE LORD FOR MY FAMILY LIVES. THE NEXT DAY I REALIZED THE DAMAGES WE HAD. FIRST,WE HAVE NO TRUCK, OUR CARPORT IS DAMAGED, AND OUR OTHER VEHICLE HAS SOME BURNED DAMAGES.  APRX 2 WEEKS LATER FORD HAS GOT IN TOUCH WITH US AND HAS DENIED OUR CLAIM. THEY TOLD US THAT THE TRUCK WAS SO BURNED THAT THE FIRE WAS UNDETERMINED.  THANK YOU FORD FOR OUR TIME IN NEED WHEN IT IS NOT OUR FAULT.....PEOPLE GET ON THE COMPUTER AND CHECK FOR RECALLS ON YOUR VEHICLES AND GET IT TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE FORD IN NOT FESSING UP. SINCE THE FIRE WE HAVE LEARNED THAT OUR 1997 FORD EXPEDITION ALSO HAD THE SAME  RECALL(SPEED CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH) KNOWING THAT THE EXPEDITION HAD THAT SAME RECALL I COULD NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH IT PARKED IN MY DRIVE WAY. TRUST AND BELIEVE IT IS NOW SOLD. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER FORD IN MY DRIVE WAY.  *NM",

IN MY CASE FORD'S REFUSAL TO PROVIDE A WARNING OF THIS PROBLEM TURNED A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE REPAIR (REPLACEMENT OF THE GASKET) INTO OVER $1300 IN PARTS AND LABOR.  *JB",

OUR CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT WORK, WE WERE NOT REAL CONCERNED AT THE TIME. WE RECEIVED A POSTCARD THE WEEK BEFORE THE FIRE, STILL STATING A VOLUNTARY RECALL AND NOW PARTS WERE NOT TO BE IN UNTIL FEBRUARY 2006. NO WHERE ON THESE RECALLS ARE THE DANGER OF A FIRE DISCUSSED. I THINK THIS RECALL SHOULD BE MANDATORY!!   WE CAME HOME AROUND 7:00 PM AND THE FIRE STARTED AROUND 3:00 AM  OUR BLAZER ONLY HAD LIABILITY AND PROBABLY WILL NOT BE COVERED. THE INSURANCE IS PROCESSING TWO CLAIMS ( 2 - $1000.00 DEDUCTIBLES) AND WE ALSO HAVE AN MEDICAL CLAIM FOR OUR DAUGHTER GOING IN FOR TOXIC SMOKE INHALATION.  WE HAD 6 PAYMENTS TO GO, NOW WE WILL BE LUCKY TO PURCHASE ONE DECENT VEHICLE AND DEFINITELY NEED TWO, WE BOTH WORK!  FORD NEEDS TO STEP UP AND TAKE CARE OF THE CONSUMERS! I HAVE MY DOUBTS THAT WE WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER FORD. MY GRANDFATHER HAULED NEW CARS FOR FORD FOR YEARS, BUT I HAVE NO LOYALTY WHEN I FIND WEBSITES GALORE ABOUT THIS RECALL AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING.

THERE WERE NO PREVIOUS PROBLEMS WITH EITHER THE CRUISE CONTROL OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.    AT ABOUT 8:15 ON THE EVENING OF AUG. 25TH I RETURNED HOME AND PARKED IN MY DRIVE WAY ABOUT SIX FEET FROM THE GARAGE DOOR.  I WENT TO BED AT 10:30 P.M.  MY NEIGHBOR RETURNED TO HIS HOME AT 12:05 A.M. HE NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER MY HOOD AND WITNESSED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT IGNITE INTO A BALL OF FLAMES.  HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND USED MY GARDEN HOSE TO WET DOWN MY GARAGE DOOR THEREBY PREVENTING MY HOUSE FROM CATCHING FIRE.  I WAS FINALLY AWAKEN AROUND 12:30A.M. BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE TRUCK WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, THE INSULATION HAD MELTED FROM THE INSIDE OF MY GARAGE DOOR, THE GARAGE DOOR WINDOWS HAD CRACKED FROM THE HEAT, THE TRIM MELTED, AND THE GUTTERS ABOVE THE GARAGE WARPED.  IF NOT FOR THE QUICK THINKING OF OUR NEIGHBOR WE COULD HAVE LOST OUR LIVES.  OUR BEDROOMS ARE LOCATED TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE IS AT THE FRONT, BY THE TIME WE REALIZED THERE WAS A FIRE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE. *JB",

A DAY OR SO LATER, I SAW A REPORT ON CNN NEWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM FOR THIS SWITCH AND FORD WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT  WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD ,IF FORD WOULD HAVE NOTIFIED ME OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HAD DRIVEN MY MOM TO VISIT SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME, OTHERWISE MY TRUCK WOULD HAVE BEEN ON MY CARPORT.  IS THERE MORE HIDDEN PROBLEMS THAT FORD IS HIDING THAT COULD,  OR WOULD, HAVE DESTROYED MY HOUSE BY FIRE IF I HAD NOT BEEN IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME?  IS IT  SAFE TO PARK IN MY GARAGE NOW? I ASKED CHEROKEE FORD IN WOOKSTOCK,  GEORGIA IF THEY KNEW OF A RECALL ON THIS SINCE IT WAS ON THE NEWS, AND THEY SAID SOME VEHICLES WERE,  BUT NOT MINE,  AND TO KEEP WATCHING THE NEWS AND IF, (BIG WORD)FORD DID HAVE A RECALL, COME BACK AND THEY COULD REIMBURSE FOR THE PART ONLY, SINCE MY REPAIRS WERE COMPLETE.*JB",

I HAVE ALSO SEEN FORD TSB'S THAT PROVE THEY HAVE KNOWN FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS, THAT THE FRONT COVER GASKETS HAVE A HIGH INCIDENCE OF FAILURE, CAUSING COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE CRANKCASE.  ALSO,  THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKETS CAN FAIL, WHICH CAUSES COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE #1 CYLINDER.  WHEN AN ENGINE IS STARTED WITH WATER IN THE CYLINDER, THE PISTON ROD IS LIKELY TO BED OR BREAK.  THE MANIFOLD GASKET FAILURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY PROBLEM, AS WELL AS THAT OF MANY OTHER FORD OWNERS.  THE REMEDY FOR THE PROBLEM IS AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT, COSTING ABOUT $4,000.

HOWEVER FORD WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW PLUG REPAIR.  UPON GOING ONLINE I FOUND OUT THAT ALOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVEING THE SAME PROBLEM AND FORD IS DONING LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT IT. I FOUND THAT PRIOR TO THE PLUG BLOWING MOST PEOPLE WERE HEARING A KNOCKING NOISE ON A COLD START. I HAD HEARD THAT THE WEEK PRIOR TO MY PLUG BLOWING. AFTER THE REPAIR THE NOISE WAS GONE FOR ABOUT 4 DAYS. WE HAD A COLD FRONT COME THRU AND WHEN I STARTED MY TRUCK THAT MORNING  THE NOISE WAS BACK AND MUCH WORSE. I TRADED MY TRUCK AS A RESULT.

I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER, AND I REMEMBER RECEIVING A RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD IN AUGUST 1998 DETAILING THIS PROBLEM.  I TOOK MY TRUCK TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER, EARNHARDT FORD, ON OCTOBER 10, 1998, AND THE DEALER INSTALLED CLIPS ON THE FRONT PORTION OF BOTH SPRINGS.    I RETRIEVED THE EJECTED PIECE OF THE BROKEN SPRING FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND I NOTICED THAT THE BREAK WAS RUSTY.  THE TRUCK HAS BEEN IN ARIZONA OR NEVADA SINCE NEW, SO TO ME THIS INDICATES THAT THE SPRING PROBABLY HAD BEEN BROKEN FOR SOME TIME.  ALSO JUST PRIOR TO THE SPRING EJECTING, I HAD BEEN INVOLVED A VERY MINOR REAR END COLLISION (THE CAR THAT HIT ME ONLY BROKE MY HITCH COVER).  I THEORIZE THAT SOMEHOW THE FORCE OF THE CAR HITTING THE BACK OF MY TRUCK MUST HAVE REPOSITIONED THE BROKEN SPRING IN SUCH A WAY THAT PLACED STRESS ON THE FRONT RETAINING CLIP  SHEARING IT AND ALLOWING THE SPRING TO BE EJECTED.    I USE MY TRUCK FOR COMMUTING WHICH IS HARDLY SEVERE DUTY USE.  LEAF SPRINGS SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER ONLY 87K MILES, AND IF THEY DO BREAK, THEY SHOULDN\u0019T EJECT. FORTUNATELY, I WAS IN THE RIGHT-HAND LANE AND THE SPRING EJECTED INTO A VACANT DIRT LOT SO NO ONE WAS HURT AND NO PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED.        I HAD BOTH REAR LEAF SPRINGS REPLACED AT GAUDIN FORD, IN LAS VEGAS ON APRIL 25, 2003.   I ASKED THE DEALER IF FORD WOULD COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR.  THEIR ANSWER WAS NO.  I BELIEVE THAT FORD SHOULD STEP UP AND COVER THE COST OF MY REPAIR.  THIS WAS NOT AN INEXPENSIVE FIX.   WHAT HAPPEN TO ME IS EXACTLY WHAT FORD WARNED AGAINST THEIR AUGUST 1998 RECALL LETTER.  REAR LEAF SPRINGS SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER ONLY 87K MILES OF NORMAL USE, AND FACT THAT THE MIDDLE SPRING WAS EJECTED SHOWS THERE IS STILL A SAFETY ISSUE.          I STILL HAVE THE PART OF BROKEN SPRING THAT I RETRIEVED FROM THE LOT.",

FIRST, ON FRONTAL IMPACT, THE BELT ALLOWS THE DRIVER OR PASSENGER TO BE THRUST FORWARD AND EITHER COME INTO UNDUE CONTACT WITH THE DASH OR STEERING WHEEL. SECONDLY, THE FALSELY TENSIONED BELT ALLOWS THE DRIVER OR PASSENGER TO BE PROPELLED TOO CLOSE TO A DEPLOYING FRONT AIRBAG, CAUSING UNDUE FRONTAL CONTACT WITH AIRBAG WHICH CAN RESULT IN INCREASED INJURY OR DEATH.

I HAD MY TRUCK TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD I HAD SUFFERED INTERNAL ENGINE DAMAGE AT START UP AND WOULD NEED A NEW ENGINE. THE COST WOULD BE ALMOST $4000.00. I GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM ANOTHER MECHANIC WHO WORKED AT ANOTHER FORD DEALERSHIP IN MY AREA AND WAS TOLD THAT THESE PARTICULAR ENGINES (THE 4.2L IN THE 1997 MODEL YEAR) HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE GASKETS ALLOWING WATER TO LEAK INTO THE CYLINDER (WATER CANNOT BE COMPRESSED SO IT KICKED BACK AND BENT THE ROD) CAUSING INTERNAL ENGINE DAMAGE. I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THAT THERE WAS A RECALL THAT ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM AND THAT FORD HAS SINCE CORRECTED IT IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL YEARS. IT IS APPARENT THAT FORD KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM, BUT CHOOSES NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. I DID CALL FORD'S CUSTOMER SERVICE HOTLINE AND WAS TOLD THAT THE RECALL DID NOT INCLUDE MY VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MANUFACTURED AT THE PLANT THAT THE RECALL COVERED. I ASKED WHY THE RECALL WAS NOT BROADENED TO INCLUDE ALL 4.2L ENGINES SINCE THIS IS EVIDENTLY A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM. I ALSO WANTED TO KNOW IF I HAD ANY RECOURSE AT ALL AND WAS TOLD THAT I COULD HAVE THE ENGINE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE AND IF FORD DECIDED TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THE RECALL I MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR A REFUND IN THE FUTURE. IF THE RECALL WOULD HAVE INCLUDED MY VEHICLE I WOULD NOT BE LODGING THIS COMPLAINT NOW. IF YOU KNOW THERE IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO CORRECT IT AND KEEP YOUR CUSTOMER BASE. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY RECOURSE THAT I MAY HAVE IN TRYING TO GET THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED? ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.     *JB",

UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION I NOTICED THE MIDDLE LEAF ON THE LEFT REAR LEAF SPRING APPEARS TO HAVE SHIFTED AS IT IS NO LONGER EVEN WITH THE OTHER TWO LEAFS.   I ALSO TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE BROKEN MIDDLE LEAF FROM THE RIGHT SIDE AND IT APPEARS THAT A MAJOR FRACTURE EXISTED FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THIS FINALLY DECIDED TO FAIL.   MY FIRST ACTION WAS TO CALL FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS TO INFORM THEM AND TO FILE A COMPLAINT OF WHAT HAPPENED AND TO SEE IF THIS TYPE PROBLEM HAD BEEN REPORTED AND IF SO WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE.  I ADVISED THEM OF THE RECALL ISSUED BY NHTSA (98V16000).  HOWEVER I WAS TOLD THAT RECALL WAS ISSUED BY A THIRD PARTY NOT FORD AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLAINTS RECEIVED OR RECALLS ISSUED FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM BY FORD.  NEXT I WAS ADVISED BY FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO BONNELL MOTORS AND TALK THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  ALTHOUGH THEY WOULDN'T MAKE ANY ASSURANCES FORD WOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIR AS THEY WORK ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS  BETWEEN FORD AND DEALERS TO DETERMINE IF THE SITUATION WARRANTS IT.  UPON MEETING WITH A SERVICE WRITER AT BONNELL MOTORS I WAS ADVISED THEY NEVER SAW THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM BEFORE, IN FACT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD TO ORDER LEAF SPRINGS BEFORE.  THE SERVICE WRITER ADVISED ME THAT FORD'S STATEMENT ON SPRINGS WAS IF THE VEHICLE IS OVERLOADED OR UNDER LOADED CAN RESULT IN LEAF SPRINGS BREAKING. THE SERVICE WRITER LOOKED UP HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO REPLACE BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LEAF SPRINGS.  THAT COST WOULD BE $615.00, AND IF HAD 2,000 FEWER MILES FORD WOULD HAVE PAID ALL BUT A $250.00 DEDUCTIBLE.    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT, THEY LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES. IN JANUARY IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO ME ABOUT A 12  TIMES, ALL WITH THE SAME EFFECTS. IN FEB 03, I TOOK  IT BACK IN AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THE PROBLEM WAS BACK AGAIN NOW HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY, NOW MARCH AND THE PROBLEM HAS HAPPEN TO ME JUST ABOUT EVERY WEEK AT LEAST 4 TO 5  TIMES A WEEK. ON THE MORNING OF MAR 28 03, I WAS TAKING MY CHILD TO DAY CARE WHILE COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT. I COULD NOT STOP THE TRUCK, I LET OFF THE BRAKES ABOUT 2  MORE TIMES, THEN I FINALLY JUST APPLIED THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD AND GOT IT TO STOP A FEW INCHES FROM THE CAR THAT WAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID BRING IT IN. I DROPPED IT OFF THE SAME DAY. WHEN I CALLED THEM THE FOLLOWING WEEK ON APRIL 1 2003. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT, BUT THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND MASTER CYLINDER AND A CHECK VALVE. THEY TOLD ME THAT WITH ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I HAD GIVEN THEM AND FROM WHAT OTHER MECHANICS SAID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE THREE COMPONENTS THEY REPLACED. THAT NIGHT MY TRUCK WAS READY. I WAS VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM BUT I WAS WRONG ON APR 06 03. WHILE OUT AND ABOUT AND COMING HOME I APPLIED THE BRAKES THE TRUCK THEN SEEM TO SLOW DOWN, THEN THE BRAKES GOT HARD AGAIN AND STARTED PULSATING AT THE BOTTOM. *JB",

THE LEAF SPRING IS BROKEN, AND MAY CONTACT THE FUEL TANK AND CAUSE A LEAK AS DESCRIBED.  FORD DID NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. WAS THIS RECALL APPLIED CORRECTLY? WAS THE FRACTURE THERE TO BEGIN WITH, AND JUST OVERLOOKED? I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SAFE TO EVEN DRIVE THIS UNTIL THIS IS REPAIRED.  2.

MANY OTHER FORD OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME PROBLEM (LEAKING GASKET WHICH IN TURN PERMITS THE COOLANT TO LEAK ANTIFREEZE INTO THE ENGINE, THEREBY DAMAGING THE ENGINE). THE 1997 FORD F-150 WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE NEW MODEL DESIGN AND APPARENTLY FORD IS NOT STEPPING UP TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS. MY RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT THIS  PROBLEM OCCURS WITH THE 1997 F-150 WHEN THE TRUCK HAS REACHED 60,000-70,000 MILES AND AFTER THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  THE FORD DEALERS AS WELL AS CORPORATE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PROBLEM AND ARE REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS RECALL WAS NOT BROAD ENOUGH TO COVER THE MANY TRUCKS THAT HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM. HAD MY VEHICLE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN MY TRUCK IMMEDIATELY TO MY DEALER TO HAVE THE WORK PERFORMED, THEREBY AVOIDING ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK'S ENGINE.

STILL SPUTTERING--REPLACED FUEL FILTER AND AIR FILTER OVER THE COURSE OF 2 MONTHS--PROBLEM WAS NOT MAJOR AND DID NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME-JUST WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT. THEN IN MARCH IT JUST STALLED WHILE MY GIRLFRIEND WAS DRIVING IT AND DAUGHTER WAS IN THE BACKSEAT AT 60MPH! TOOK TO LOCAL MECHANIC AND THEY COULD NOT RECEIVE A DIAGNOSTIC CODE-FINALLY AFTER TWO WEEKS OF DRIVING IT TO SEE IF THEY COULD MAKE IT SPUTTER OR STALL IT HAPPENED AND THEY RECEIVE A CODE FOR A EGR VALVE WHICH WAS FUEL RELATED--DID NOT FIX, COST 105$--TOOK BACK TO THEM AND THEY KEPT AN ADDITIONAL 2 WEEKS AND SAID THEY GAVE UP--COULD NOT DIAGNOSE. TOOK TO LOCAL FORD DEALER(TRI-COUNTY FORD 05/02) AND THEY HAD 3 DAYS BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN. REPLACED PFE SENSOR (192$-P0401) WHICH I AM TOLD IS THE ONE WHICH CONTROLS THE VALVE THAT WAS REPLACED. DID NOT FIX-RETURNED TO FORD DEALER(05/02) AND THEY HAD A FEW MORE DAYS AND RECEIVED ANOTHER CODE(P0605) AND WAS TOLD MY PCM NEEDED REPLACING. WHEN I TOLD THE TECH IT WAS JUST DONE A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO HE SAID IT WAS PROBABLY A JUNKED PART. E-Z WAY WILL NOT FIX. THEY SAID THAT THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED AND IT WAS UP TO FORD. FORD WILL NOT REPLACE PART, HAVE ALREADY BEEN THAT ROUTE.  SAID IF IT HAD BEEN REPAIRED AT A CERTIFIED FORD DEALER THE WHOLE TIME MAYBE THEY COULD HELP AND ALL PARTS HAVE 12MTH WARRANTY. E-Z WAY OFFERED 200$ TOWARD THE PART BUT ONLY IF WE TAKE IT TO THE PLACE THAT ORIGINALLY REPLACED THE PART(WHICH HAPPENS TO BE OPERATED BY THE OWNER OF E-Z WAYS BROTHER).

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH . I  HOPE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THESE PARTS REPLACED  BY THE COMPANIES SO THAT NO ONE WITH A MODIFIED HANDICAPPED STEERING COLUMN EXTENSION DOES NOT GET KILLED OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE , I WAS LUCKY TO FIND IT EARLY  BUT MAYBE SOME ONE ELSE WON'T BE.

THE NEXT DAY I CHECKED THE CRUISE CABLE AND IT WAS NOT PULLED IN WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. I WAS LUCKY THERE WERE NO CARS ON THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT OF ME WHEN IT HAPPENED.

AS WE PULLED IN THE SHOP WITH IT SQUEAKING AT EACH TURN OF THE STEERING WHEEL A MECHANIC WALKED OVER AND SAID THAT MUST BE A 1997. I SAID YES AND HE SAID THE PITMAN ARM IS SUPPOSED TO BE LUBED FOR LIFE SO THERE IS NO GREASE FITTING, AND THEY ARE KNOWN TO FAIL ON THE 1997'S. WE GET OUR TRUCK OIL CHANGED AND LUBED EVERY 3000 MILES OR CLOSE TO IT. HE SAID IF WE HADN'T NOTICE THE NOISE IT WOULD HAVE SEIZED UP AND BROKE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE PITMAN ARM CONNECTS THE STEERING BOX SHAFT TO THE STEERING LINKAGE AND A FAILURE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SUDDEN LOSS OF STEERING. WE GOT IT FIXED IMMEDIATELY BY REPLACING THE PITMAN ARM AT A COST OF CLOSE TO $300. HOW LONG WILL THE NEW ARM LAST  WITHOUT GREASE? I REPORTED IT TO FORD, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD TRACK THE VEHICLES AND NOTIFY ME IF THERE IS A RECALL. THEN I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THERE ARE AT LEAST A COUPLE SERVICE BULLETINS DATING BACK TO 97 AND 98 THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM IN EARLY PRODUCTION. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD NOTIFY US OF THE PROBLEM WHILE THE WARRANTY WOULD COVER  THE REPAIR AND AT LEAST TO ASSURE OUR STEERING WOULD NOT FAIL.

THEY CHECKED THE ABS SYSTEM FOUND NO ERRORS, THEY CHECKED THE BRAKES NO PROBLEMS. THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING, I HAD TO SPEEK WITH THE SERVICE TECH DIRECTLY GIVING MORE OF A DETAIL OF WHAT HAPPENS. THEY CAME BACK AND FOUND THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER WAS LEAKING CAUSING THE INTERMITTENT (EXTREMELY RANDOM) FAILURE. THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE REPAIR (NO PROBLEM). I CALLED FORD MOTOR DIRECT AND ASKED TO BE REFUNDED MY REPAIR COST BECAUSE I DID'NT THINK A MASTER BRAKE CYCLINDER SHOULD BE FAILING @ 38K. THEY WERE VERY PROFESSIONAL AND HAD NO OBJECTIONS, THEY AGREED TOTALLY (THEY PAID ME FOR THE REPAIR). A WEEK LATER, THIS MORNING I ALMOST CRASHED INTO A SEMI. THE END OF MY ROAD HAS A STOP SIGN CONECTING TO A MAJOR HIGHWAY. WHEN I PROCEEDED TO USE MY BRAKES TO STOP THE VEHICLE DID NOT STOP! THE BRAKE PROBLEM WAS BACK. THIS INCIDENT WAS THE WORST OF THE BRAKE FAILURES, I LITERALLY ALMOST GOT CRUSHED BY THE SEMIDID. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURES SERVICE REP. THEY TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THE FIX WITH MASTER CYCLINER, OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT THE FIX. I ASKED WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT COULD BE  THEY HAD NO CLUE!

HE WAS TO GET BACK TO ME BUT HAS NOT TO DATE.  MY INITIAL COMPLAINT WAS INTERMITTANT SHUTTER IN THE FRONT END WHEN BRAKING HARD FROM HIGH SPEED.  THE PROBLEM DIDN'T SEEM TO BE BRAKE RELATED BUT MIGHT BE TIRE RELATED GIVEN THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL OF THE TIME AND THAT THE CRACKING TIRES ARE ON THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK. THEY WERE PURCHASED FROM A LOCAL FIRESTONE DEALER AS REPLACEMENTS FOR THE OEM WILDERNESS HT TIRES SOLD ON THE TRUCK WHEN I PURCHASED IT NEW AND HAVE ABOUT 32,000 MILES ON THEM.  FIRESTONE WILL NOT TELL ME THAT THEY ARE SAFE BUT WILL NOT REPLACE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ON \"NOT ON THE LIST\".  ONE MANAGER DID TELL ME THAT FIRESTONE WOULD PROBABLY END UP REPLACING ADDITIONAL TIRE SIZES IN THE FUTURE.

THIS IS DUE TO THE VIBRATION OF THE UPPER DOOR IN THE SLIPSTREAM CREATED WHEN THE TRUCKS ARE BEING DRIVEN.

I HAVE BEEN RELEASING THE BRAKE, THE LIGHT IS OFF, THE PEDAL IS UP, BUT THE BRAKE APPARENTLY IS STILL ON.  THE TIRES & RIMS ARE ICING UP, THE BRAKE SHOES ON THAT SIDE ARE CRUMBLING. THIS CAUSES POOR BRAKING CONDITIONS. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, I HAD BEEN TOLD TO WATCH FOR THIS PROBLEM, & HAD WANTED IT FIXED. ( I WOULD RATHER NOT FIND OUT HOW BAD THIS IS BY SOMETHING OR SOMEONE. ) IN FACT, THAT IS THE REASON THAT I WAS GIVEN WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT FORD WOULD FIX IT, UNTIL THEY SAW THE MILAGE ON THE VEHICLE, THEN THEY TOLD ME, NOPE WE WON\u0012T FIX IT, YOU\u0012LL HAVE TO PAY US $700 (CDN) AS A \"GOOD WILL GESTURE\" FROM FORD. (THIS SEEMS A LITTLE STEEP!) & ALSO THEY THOUGHT I SHOULD BRING THE TRUCK IN SO THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THERE\u0012S NO DAMAGE TO THE WHEELS OR BRAKES.  IF THE BRAKES CAN FREEZE ON,... WHAT STOPS THEM FROM FREEZING WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON?? I'M TOLD THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE THAT STOPS THIS FROM BEING AN ISSUE, BUT THE SYSTEM IS ONLY AS GOOD AS IT IS WEAKEST PART, & WHEN USING \"BRUTE FORCE\" TO BREAK THEM FREE, I WOULD THINK SOMETHING SOMEWHERE HAS GOT TO GIVE. IF THERE WERE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT WERE THE REASON THAT FORD WAS MAKING THE MODIFICATIONS WHILST THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER IT\u0012S ORIGINAL WARRANTY, I SHOULD THINK  THESE SAFETY CONCERNS DO NOT GO AWAY ONCE THE TRUCK IS NOT ON WARRANTY.  I WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A RECALL SITUATION, NOT JUST A BULLETIN.  THEY HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT IS A PROBLEM, & WERE EVEN FIXING IT IF IT WAS UNDER THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROBLEM GOES MUCH FURTHER, & FORD SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE REPAIRS, SINCE IT IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE.

I WRAPPED LOOSE CLAMP IN TAPE TO STOP RATTLE.  NOW IN 11/99 WHILE WASHING CAR I NOTICED LOWER LEAF IS KICKED OUT CONSIDERABLY FARTHER, NOW MEASURING A FULL 1\".  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD CAC, AND THE DEALER WILL PROBABLY INSTALL A KIT PER SB99-6477.  HOWEVER, I VIEW THIS AS A VERY BIG PROBLEM/SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE FORD TSB KIT ONLY REPLACES THE EXISTING CLAMP FOR THE TWO UPPOER LEAFS.  THE LOWER LEAF IS \"ADJUSTED\" BACK INTO PLACE.  INTERNET RESEARCH SHOWS NUMEROUS PEOPLE WITH SAME COMPAINT.  THIS IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION.  IN MY CURRENT SITUATION THE LOWER LEAF, AT A 1\" AFT KICKOUT, IS CONTACTING THE FWD INSIDE AND AFT OUTSIDE U-BOLT.  THERE CAN BE NO OTHER OUTCOME TO THIS THAN FOR THE SPRING TO EXERT ENOUGH FORCE OVER TIME TO WEAKEN BOTH U-BOLTS TO THE POINT OF FAILURE.  IN MY CASE I'LL BE WATCHING LIKE A HAWK.  HOWEVER WERE IT NOT FOR THE INITIAL RATTLE I DOUBT THAT I WOULD HAVE EVER SEEN THE PROBLEM UNTIL AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN MY AXLE FELL OFF.  I'VE BEEN HAPPY WITH THE TRUCK AND FORD IN GENERAL UNTIL NOW, BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO WAKE UP AND ADDRESS THIS.  LOOKING AT CHEVROLET TRUCKS THEY HAVE WHAT SEEMS TO BE A BETTER DESIGN PHILOSOPHY;  THE CHEVROLET TRUCK HAS \"SQUARE\" U-BOLTS, THREADS DOWN , WHICH STRADDLE THE LEAF SPRING ASSEMBLIES WITH CLOSE TOLERANCE TO KEEP THE STACK TOGETHER ON TOP OF AXLE.  FORD'S DESIGN HAS THE U-BOLTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPRING STACK, THREADS UP, AND RELIES ON THE COMPRESSION FORCE TO KEEP THE STACK TOGETHER INSTEAD OF THE U-BOLT ITSELF.  I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE;  OVER TIME AS THESE TRUCKS ACQUIRE MORE MILEAGE THERE MAY BE SOME U-BOLT FAILURES.  *AK",

WE INFORMED THE DEALERSHIP OF THE TRUCKS PROBLEMS AND THE NEXT DAY THEY CALLED TO TELL US THAT THE DOOR CHIME HAD BEEN FIXED BUT THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE FLUSHED ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURERS SUGGESTION. WE STATED THAT IF THIS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER BILLY WAS ON THE HIGHWAY TOWARDS HOME WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IN THE TRUCK FAILED HE HAD TO PUSH THE TRUCK OFF THE HIGHWAY AND WALK TO GET HELP.

THE FLUID SMELLED BURNT BUT WAS STILL RED IN COLOR ALSO THEY FOUND METAL FRAGMENTS IN THE FLUID AND THE TRANSMISSION FILTER WAS NOT CHANGED OUT AT THE TIME THE \"DELUX FLUSH\" WAS PERFORMED BY THE PREVIOUS DEALERSHIP. HENCE: IF THE FLUSH WAS NECESSARY THEN WHY WOULD`NT THE FILTER CHANGE OUT BE? ACCORDING TO DON DAVIS FORD, FORD RECOMMENDS THE FLUSH BUT NOT THE FILTER TO BE CHANGED AND THEY WERE GOING BY THE MANUFACTURERS SUGGESTIONS.

THERE HAS BEEN NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO CONSUMERS BY FORD MOTOR CO. OF THIS PROBLEM OR SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT CORRECTIVE ACTION TO TAKE IF FAILURE OCCURS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AT 65 MPH.  *AK",
