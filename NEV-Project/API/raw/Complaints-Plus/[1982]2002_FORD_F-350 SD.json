ON THE SECOND OCCASION I HAD ALREADY GONE TO SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE IN THE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM BUT THE SAME FUEL FLOW INTERUPTION OCCURED AGAIN REQUIRING THE TRUCK TO BE TOWED.      I HAD CHANGED THE FUEL FILTER ON THE ROAD WITH NO IMPROVEMENTS.  SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND PAID TO HAVE THE TANK TO MY 2002 FORD F350 7.3 LITER TURBO DIESEL DRAINED AND DROPPED.  THE LIFT PUMP WAS PULLED AND LARGE QUANTITY OF A STRINGY SILVER MATALIC CHIPS WERE CLOGING THE CORSE SCREEN. THE PUMP WAS OPENED AND THE TWO INTERIOR TORPEDO SHAPED SCREENS WERE COMPLEATLY COATED IN SILVER CHIP RESIDUE.  THE TANK WAS EMPTIED, FLUSHED, CLEANED AND WIPED DOWN.  ALL FILTERS SOAKED AND SPRAYED WITH COMPRESSED AIR.  EVERYTHING REASEMBLED, REINSTALL TANK, PUMP FUEL.  THIS COMPLETE CLEANING OF THE MATALIC DEBRIS DELAMINATING OFF THE INSIDE OF THE TANK MADE THE TRUCK USABLE FOR ABOUT 800 MILES AND THEN THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM OCCURED.  TOWED A SECOND TIME.  DRAIN DROP TANK, FIND RENU PROVIDER.  TAKE A DAY OFF WORK DRIVE TO SWAP OLD TANK FOR REPLACEMENT WITH THE RENU COATING BAKED IN.  CLEAN LIFT PUMP REINSTALL TANK, TRANSFER FUEL, REPLACE FILTER, HOPE NEW TANK LASTS AND INJECTORS HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTED.  WHAT A HASTLE.  LOST WORK LOST TIME AND $3,500 IN EXPENSES SO FAR.

I FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH A HELI COIL EVERYTHING WAS FINE FOR A FEW MONTHS THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN WITH THE SAME PLUG I AGAIN FIXED IT MAKING SURE TO TIGHTEN THE PLUG DOWN GOOD, THREE MONTHS LATER THE SAME THING SO I AGAIN FIXED IT EACH TIME HAVING TO PURCHASE A NEW COIL. NOW YEAR AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT 2 YEARS SINCE THE PLUGS WERE INSTALLED, CYLINDER 2 JUST BLEW OUT A PLUG AND DESTROYED ITS COIL, SO I BEGAN TO THINK THERES SOMETHING GOING ON HERE, SOMETHINGS WRONG!, & LOOKED ON LINE FOR THE ANSWER. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS, AND NO ONE IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT! THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME IN A YEAR THIS HAS HAPPENED! & I'M FED UP! I HAVE THE SPARK PLUG & COIL FROM THIS LAST.

MY HUSBAND WAS ALONE AT THE TIME, AND HE WAS ABOUT 8 MILES FROM ANY HOUSE OR STORE, SO HE WALKED FOR HELP AT 8:30 PM.  HE WAS ABLE TO GET A TOW TRUCK TO PICK HIM UP, BRING HIM HOME AT 1 AM, AND DELIVER THE TRUCK TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALER.  THE COST OF THE TOW WAS OVER $300.00.  THE NEXT DAY HE WAS UNABLE TO GET TO WORK DUE TO NO VEHICLE.  WE CONTACTED THE DEALER AND IT TOOK THEM THE ENTIRE DAY TO CONTACT US BACK.  THEY HAD NO DIAGNOSIS, BUT SUSPECTED IT HAD TO DO WITH A LOCKOUT DEVICE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE VALVE COVERS BE REMOVED AND AROUND $700.00 IN SERVICE COSTS.  THEY DID CHARGE US A DIAGNOSTIC FEE WHICH WAS AROUND $80.00 - $90.00. I HAD LOOKED ON THE INTERNET AND KEPT FINDING REFERENCES TO A CAMSHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR WITH THE SAME SYMPTOM OF SUDDEN STALLING.  I ASKED THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IF THAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM AND HE SAID IT WAS VERY UNLIKELY; IN FACT I THINK HE CLAIMED HE WAS UNAWARE OF A CPS ISSUE AT ALL.  THE TRUCK WAS RUNNING SO WE PICKED IT UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP, AND IT STALLED AGAIN ON OUR WAY HOME.  SO WE HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO ANOTHER DEALER, A DISTANCE OF 80 MILES AND A COST OF ANOTHER $150.00.

I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE DOING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 65 MPH TOWING A LIGHT SINGLE WHEEL TRAILER WHEN THE TREAD SEPARATED DAMAGING THE FENDER, INNER FENDER LINER AND THE ELECTRICAL WIRING ABOVE THE INNER FENDER.

RECEIVED A CALL IN 2 HOURS AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT FORD CAN DO IS RESURFACE WARPED ROTORS UNLESS THE ROTORS DO NOT MEET FORD??S SPECIFICATION.  I AM SURE THAT THE ONLY SPECIFICATION IS ON THICKNESS, AND I AM SURE THAT SINCE THE PADS STILL HAVE 10MM THE ROTORS ARE GOING TO BE THICK ENOUGH TO BE TURNED OR RESURFACED.  WHEN THE SURFACE OF THE ROTOR IS RESURFACED A LAYER OF THE METAL IS SHAVED OFF LEAVING LESS METAL ON THE ROTOR, PUT A DIFFERENT WAY THINNER ROTOR WALLS.  THE THINNER THE ROTOR WALL, THE FASTER THE ROTOR WILL HEAT UP, AND HEAT CAUSES THE DEFECTIVE ROTORS TO WARP.  IF DEFECTIVE ROTORS ARE TURNED THEY WILL WARP AGAIN, AND THEY WILL WARP IN LESS SEVERE CONDITIONS THAN THE FIRST TIME WHEN THEY WERE THICKER.  THE OPERATOR ON THE PHONE WAS NOT TECHNICAL AND THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DEAF EARS.  I ALSO TOLD THE OPERATOR THAT THIS DEFECT IS A SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE FACT THAT IF I AM GOING DOWN A HILL AND HAVE TO PUT ON MY BRAKES AND HIT A SLICK AREA IN THE ROAD, THERE IS A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE THAN IF THE BRAKES WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THIS FACT COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT TURNED ROTORS WOULD WARP AT A GREATER RATE AND MORE QUICKLY, LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT FORD IS ENCOURAGING THE DEALERS TO PLACE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS, DEFECTIVE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.    MY F350 HAS 21500 MILES, AND IS UNDER WARRANTY.
