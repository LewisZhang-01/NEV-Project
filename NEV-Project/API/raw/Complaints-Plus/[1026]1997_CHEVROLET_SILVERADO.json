VEHICLE ENGINE STARTED TO DIE WHILE DRIVING, OCCASIONALLY AT FIRST. IT WOULD RESTART IMMEDIATELY SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES IT HAD TO SIT FOR A WHILE. THIS PROBLEM STARTED IN YEARS PREVIOUS TO 2010 INTERMITTENTLY BUT BECAME MORE FREQUENT IN 2010- 2011. DIDN'T MATTER WHAT SPEED I WAS TRAVELING, IT WOULD QUIT ON THE INTERSTATE GOING 75 MPH OR IN DRIVEWAY GOING 5 MPH. SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING AND IMMEDIATELY LIKE SOMEONE TURNED THE KEY OFF. ALL POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES FAILED BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO PULL THE VEHICLE OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND STOP IT WHEN IT HAPPENED, ONLY BECAUSE I KNEW HOW TO STEER WITH OUT POWER STEERING AND HAD THE STRENGTH TO DO IT. WITH OTHERS THIS COULD EASILY CAUSE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS.  MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE OVER THE YEARS WITH A MECHANIC TO FIND THE PROBLEM WITH NO LUCK. FINALLY SOMEONE SUGGESTED REPLACING THE PMD MODULE WHICH I DID IN 2011 AND IT SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR 3 MORE YEARS. IT IS NOW HAPPENING AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THE PMD MODULE NEEDS TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT BECAUSE IT  GETS TOO HOT AND CAUSES THIS FAILURE. I BELIEVE THIS CONSTITUTES A POOR DESIGN AND A DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED. SINCE THIS HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE I HAVE TALKED WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE JUST IN MY AREA WHO OWN THE SAME TYPE OF ENGINE AND HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND OTHERS IN OTHER AREAS.   *TR",

THE RADIATOR WAS REPLACED THREE TIMES UNTIL THE OWNER OF THE REPAIR SHOP STATED THAT HE WOULD NO LONGER REPLACE THE RADIATOR AND EXPLAINED THAT THE 1997 SILVERADO PICKUP WAS KNOWN FOR A CONDITION CALLED.  ELECTROLYSIS.       IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I REMOVE THE BATTERY CABLE AFTER EACH TIME I DROVE THE VEHICLE.  I STARTED TO REMOVING THE POSITIVE BATTERY CABLE AND WITHIN 3 WEEKS THE SAME PROBLEM.  I THEN CONTACTED RUDOLPH CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN EL PASO, TEXAS.       THEY REFUSED TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM AND REFERRED ME TO EMMITT RADIATOR SHOP, ALSO IN EL PASO, TEXAS.  THEY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE $80.00 PER HOUR WITH A MINIMUM OF 10 TO 12 HOURS WITH NO GUARANTEE.  THEY DID SUGGEST THAT I REMOVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE BATTERY CABLES.  THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEM WITH THE EXPLODING BATTERY COMES TO LIGHT.  WHEN I WOULD TRY TO REMOVE THE BATTERY CABLES AFTER EACH TRIP, EVEN TO THE MOVIES OR OUT TO DINNER, THE BATTERY WOULD BE SO HOT THAT IT WOULD BURN MY HANDS.  I ALSO KEPT REPLACING THE BATTERIES AND FINALLY ASK A SALESWOMAN AT AUTO ZONE SUPPLY HOUSE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE BATTERIES AND HE POINTED TO THE BATTERY AND SAID, \"LOOK AT THE SIDES OF THE BATTERY, HOW IT IS EXTENDING OUTWARD IT COULD EXPLODE\". AGAIN I WAS TOLD ME THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN, BUT I WILL DO MY BEST. IT WILL SEEM TO SURGE IN TURNING POWER WHILE TURNING IN EITHER DIRECTION, CAUSING YOU TO HAVE TO STEER IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHILE IN A CURVE TO ADJUST COURSE. IT CAN BE VERY NERVE-RACKING FOR ME AND FOR SOMEONE THAT IS UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM I CAN SEE WHERE IT COULD EASILY LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT. MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY UNAWARE AND HAS INSISTED THAT I HAVE IT FIXED BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS. IT BECOMES EVEN MORE DANGEROUS AT HIGHER SPEEDS. I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON SOME TYPE OF CONTROL MODULE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POWER STEERING ON THESE TRUCKS..? WHICH HAS LED ME TO INQUIRE NOW ABOUT A RECALL / REPAIR FOR THE PROBLEM.

THIS ELECTRICAL STEERING CONTROL SYSTEM IS CAUSING A VERY SERIOUS INTERMITTANT STEERING PROBLEM ONLY DURING A RIGHT HAND TURN. THIS HAS TWICE ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AS THE NATURAL REACTION TO THIS FAILURE (WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF AS A LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL) IS TO JERK THE STEERING WHEEL FURTHER TO THE RIGHT TO REGAIN STEERING CONTROL. IN BOTH NEAR ACCIDENT SITUATIONS THERE WAS A CAR ON MY RIGHT SIDE WHICH I CAME CLOSE TO HITTING. THE PROBLEM IS WORSE THE FASTER YOU GO AND AT LOW SPEED NOT MUCH OF A CONCERN BUT AT HIGHWAY SPEED IT IS SERIOUS. THIS MALFUNCTION OCCURS AT ALL SPEEDS. DEALER, WHICH HAS BEEN COURTEOUS AND HELPFULL, TELLS ME THEY HAVE HAD TWO TRUCKS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN FOR THE SAME TROUBLE (SWP SENSOR) AND A CO-WORKER ALSO HAS THE SAME TROUBLE, SO THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE AFFECTING OTHER GM VEHICLES INCLUDING SUBURBAN, TAHOE, YUKON AND SIERRA.  I HAVE NOT HAD IT REPAIRED AT THIS TIME BUT PLAN TO REPLACE THE SWP SENSOR MYSELF QUITE SOON AS THE DEALER SAYS MY WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 36,000 MILES. ESTIMATED DEALER REPAIR COST IS 160.00. I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND IS THE FIRST TIME IN SOME 30 YEARS OF DRIVING I HAVE ENCOUNTERED A MALFUNCTION OF THIS TYPE, WHEN IT HAPPENS AT FREEWAY SPEED IT GETS YOUR ATTENTION VERY FAST! AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE ROLL OVER AS WELL SHOULD THE DRIVER JERK ON THE WHEEL TO HARD TO CORRECT IT. I FEEL CHEVROLET IS AWARE OF THIS TROUBLE AND SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS REGARDLESS OF WARRANTY COVERAGE AS LAW SUITES AS A RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT/S WILL COST THEM MUCH MUCH MORE.*AK",

IN SEPT OF 2000 THE SAME PROBLEMS STARTED AGAIN AND WAS TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP.  THEY SAID THEY COULD DIAGNOSE IT UNLESS IT WAS DOING THE STALLING OUT, SO WE PROCEEDED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS IT WAS OUR ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.  ON DEC. 26 WE HAD TRUCK TOWED TO DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE SAME PART REPLACED AS WAS DONE IN 1997 ONLY 5 MONTHS AFTER WE PURCHASED THIS NEW TRUCK.  THIS PART AS TOLD TO US BY CHEVROLET AND THE DEALERSHIP THEY HAD A SPECIAL POLICY # 00064 - OUR REF # C02653123 THRU CHEVR. WAS TOLD THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM IN REPLACING THE PART AGAIN.  NOW THEY ARE RENIGIN ON IT.  SAID WE WERE OVER OUR MILES - 120,000 OR 11 YRS.  THE PART WAS GOING BAD AT 118,187 IN SEPT., BUT WE KEPT BEING TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS NOT SHOWING UP AND WAS PROBABLY BAD GAS.  WE TOOK IT 3 TIMES AND THEY NEVER DOCUMENTED IT ONLY FIXED OTHER PROBLEMS.  NOW THAT THE WARRANTY IS OUT, THE TRUCK HAS COMPLETELY STOPPED RUNNING AND THEY REFUSE TO HONOR REPLACING THE PART THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN SEPT.  SO HERE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE OF THE DEALERSHIP MECHANICS REFUSING TO BELIEVE IT WAS THAT UNTIL THEY REPLACED A WATER SENSOR TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE COMPUTER ON IT TO VERIFY IT AND WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN IT TO 2 OTHER MECHANICS THAT TOLD US THAT WAS THE PROBLEM AND TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE IT WAS A BAD PART THAT THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE WITH SINCE 1994.  NO ONE IMFORMED US OF THIS...  NOW WE ARE FACED WITH A BILL OF OVER $1700.00 TO REPLACE THIS SAME PART THAT WE KNEW WAS BAD AND WE WERE UNDER THE MILES OF OUR WARRANTY FOR THIS, BUT SINCE THE DEALERSHIP MECHANICS SAID THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM, WE KEPT DRIVING IT SINCE IT WAS OUR ONLY MEANS OF GETTING TO WORK.
