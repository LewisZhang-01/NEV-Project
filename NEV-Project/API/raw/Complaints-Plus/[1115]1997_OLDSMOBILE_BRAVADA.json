WELL, I DID THAT AND WAS TOLD AFTER A TOTAL RUN AROUND AS WELL AS THE SERVICE GARAGE GOING THRU THE RUN AROUND AS WELL CALLING ON IT, THAT IT DOES NOT AFFECT MY 97' OLD'S BRAVADA.  SO HERE I AM WITH A TRUCK THAT IS UNDER THE STATED TIME OF REPAIR BY GM WITH FRONT END WORK THAT WILL COST ME OVER $800.00 TO FIX AND GM DOES NOT CARE.  SO WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A CAMPAIGN ON THE VEHICLE IF GM HAD NOT INTENTION OF DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT?  THE SERVICE GUY AT THE GARAGE EVEN ASKED THE REP. FROM GM, \"SO AM I SUPPOSED TO LET THE GUY DRIVE OFF WITH THE BAD BALLJOINTS SO HIS WHEELS FALL OFF AND POSSIBLY CREATING AN ACCIDENT?\"  SHE DID NOT RESPOND AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL DO. SO IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE A TRUCK THAT I CAN NOT DRIVE MUCH FOR FEAR OF THE WHEELS FALLING OFF, UNLESS I PAY FOR THE WORK TO DO SO.  SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE COMPAINT WHEN GM INTENDED ON DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT?
