I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER, BABY MY CAR, AND GET ALL MAINTENANCE DONE LIKE CLOCKWORK OR SOONER.

I'VE REPEATEDLY CONTACTED VIA EMAIL AND VOICEMAIL THE LAW FIRM OF MAZIE SLATER KATZ & FREEMAN IN ROSELAND, NEW JERSEY WHO IS HANDLING A CLASS ACTION ON THIS VERY ISSUE, THE HONDA A/C DESIGN DEFECTS.  BOTH ATTORNEYS MATTHEW MENDELSON AND KAREN KELSON ARE FAR, FAR TOO BUSY WITH THEIR BUSY DAYS TO RETURN VOICEMAILS AND EMAILS, SO I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE FEES OF THE CLASS ACTION, RATHER THAN PROVIDING ANY TANGIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS, MUCH LIKE HONDA ITSELF RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM:  IGNORE IT.  MAYBE IT WILL GO AWAY.  I'M DISGUSTED WITH BOTH FIRMS AT THIS POINT.    OTHERWISE MY CAR IS IN FINE SHAPE, I'M VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND IT'S VERY LIKELY THE BEST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED.  HOWEVER, THIS GLARING PROBLEM, WHEN IT RIPENS AS IT HAS FOR COUNTLESS OTHER HONDA DRIVERS, COULD DESTROY MY ENGINE, AND FRANKLY I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO FIX IT.  LIVING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SUCH AN EVENT WOULD SHUT DOWN MY LIFE ACROSS THE BOARD.    I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT IF HONDA ACTUALLY DID WHAT ADULTS DO, TAKE CHARGE, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DESIGN DEFECTS WITH REGARD TO THIS COMPONENT, ISSUE AN APOLOGY, AND WE CAN ALL GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

I WAS THEN TOLD TO CONTACT HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WHERE EVENTUALLY I WAS TOLD BY HONDA THAT THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE. THE REASON WAS THAT I DID NOT GET VALVE ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME OF MY 60000 MI SERVICE. THESE ARE HYDRAULIC VALVES AND ACCORDING TO MY OWN MECHANIC AND VERIFIED BY ANOTHER MECHANIC, THIS IS NOT STANDARD PRACTICE. THIS 'VALVE ADJUSTMENT' RECOMMENDATION IS ALSO NOT PART OF THE MITCHELL OEM RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO THAT WERE FOLLOWED BY MY MECHANIC (TSB 03-038 IS ALSO NOT INCLUDED).   THE OUTCOME WAS TO TAKE MY VEHICLE FROM HONDA WHERE THEY DID NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT DESPITE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN AND WIDESPREAD DEFECT AND BRING IT TO MY OWN MECHANIC.
