I CALLED MY HUSBAND TO HELP CALM ME DOWN, AS MY HEART WAS RACING AND I WAS SHAKING. I PUT MY HAZARDS ON AN PULLED OVER A LITTLE MORE FOR SAFETY. JUST THEN I NOTICED A MAN WALKING TOWARD ME FROM FURTHER UP THE HIGHWAY. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND COULD HEAR THE CONVERSATION THAT THE MAN WAS HAVING WHILE ON HIS PHONE. WHEN HE HUNG UP THE PHONE, HE STATED THE HE CALLED 911. THE MAN EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS PASSING ME AND WITNESSED WHAT LOOKED LIKE ICE COMING UP OUT OF MY SUNROOF AND IT HIT HIS CAR. THE MAN WAS VISIBLY UPSET, BUT COULD SEE THAT I WAS NOT AT FAULT, AND ACTED APPROPRIATELY. THE MAN SAID THAT THE GLASS HAD CHIPPED THE CAR THAT HE WAS DRIVING. HE APPEARED AS SURPRISED  AS I WAS ABOUT THE SITUATION. THE MAN HELPED ME TO PICK UP THE LOOSE GLASS AND THE GLASS ON MY SEATS. HE THEN SUGGESTED MOVING UP THE ROAD A FEW HUNDRED FEET WHERE HE WAS PULLED OFF, AS THE HIGHWAY PATROL WERE IN ROUTE. THE HP MADE SURE THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND ASKED THAT WE EXCHANGE INSURANCE. WE BOTH TOOK PICTURES, I GAVE MY INFORMATION TO ONE OF THE CHP OFFICERS AND DROVE HOME. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY. WHEN EXPLAINING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AGENT HE STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING, WHICH PROMPTED ME TO RESEARCH \"EXPLODING WINDSHIELDS\" AND LED ME TO SEVERAL ARTICLES ON THE MATTER. I AM NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT ONLY FIXING MY CAR, BUT ALSO THE PAINT JOB ON THE CAR OF GENTLEMAN WHO WAS PASSING ME ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN IT OCCURRED.",
