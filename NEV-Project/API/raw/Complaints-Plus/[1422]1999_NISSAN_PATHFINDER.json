I HAD A FEW DAYS TO CONSIDER THE OFFER BUT WAS UNDER IMMENSE PRESSURE AND THREATS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR STORAGE CHARGES FOR MY CAR ON THEIR LOT AND ALSO THE LOANER CAR IF I DID NOT ACCEPT THEIR OFFER. THE DEALERSHIP EVEN THREATENED RESORTING TO \"OTHER MEASURES\" WHICH I INTERPRETED AS \"CALL THE POLICE\" IF I DID NOT EITHER ACCEPT THE OFFER OR RETURN THE LOANER CAR. WE ARE A SINGLE INCOME FAMILY, PARTIALLY DISABLE SPOUSE WHO CAN'T WORK WITH 2 KIDS IN COLLEGE SO I CAN'T AFFORD A CAR PAYMENT OR TO TAKE A LOSS ON THE VEHICLE. I TOLD NISSAN THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD THEIR OFFER BECAUSE I HAD DECIDED ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT I NEED TO GET ANOTHER 100K MILES OUT OF THIS CAR AND THEN PROCEEDED TO INVEST ABOUT $4,000 INTO MAJOR MAINTENANCE THAT WOULD EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE CAR. I WAS WILLING TO PROVE ALL OF IT WITH RECEIPTS. I WAS TOLD BY NISSANN THAT THEY WOULD NEVER PAY ME FOR THIS MAINTENANCE, NO MATTER WHAT. I ASKED FOR A COPY OF THE INSPECTION REPORT SO I COULD ASSESS THE RISK AND THAT WAS DENIED.  I COULD NOT FINANCIALLY AFFORD THE OFFER AND COULD NOT LONGER TOLERATE THE STRESS OF WORRYING ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I RETURNED THE LOANER AND PICKED UP MY CAR AND HAVE PUT IT BACK INTO FULL SERVICE. WHEN LEAVING THE LOT I HEAR A NOISE IN THE FRONT AND FELT SOMETHING IN THE STEERING THAT I HAVE NEVER NOTICED BEFORE. I HAVE SINCE HEARD IT A FEW MORE TIMES. I ASKED NISSAN IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE INSPECTION BUT THEY ARE NOT ANSWERING ME. WHY WOULD CORROSION MAKE A NOISE ?

WE BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED DUE TO EXCESSIVE CORROSION ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE STRUT TOWER AND LED TO OUR LOOSING OUR STEERING.  THIS OCCURRED IN JULY 2009, AT THAT TIME, WE KNEW NOTHING OF A RECALL INVOLVING THIS PROBLEM, I CALLED NISSAN AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND THERE WERE NO RECALLS.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE COULD NOT BE REPAIRED, WE HAD TO JUNK IT.  THE CAR WAS ONLY 10 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND ALWAYS MAINTAINED.  I FEEL WE SHOULD GET SOME REIMBURSEMENT AS THE CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH SOMETHING, HOWEVER, IF THE STEERING COLUMN IS NO LONGER ATTACHED AND CORROSION IS SO BAD, WE COULD NOT SELL THIS VEHICLE TO ANYONE.

I GOT OUT OF MY VEHICLE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND DISCOVERED THAT MY LEFT FRONT WHEEL WELL HAD RUSTED THROUGH AND HAD ROTATED UP AND INTO MY STEERING COLUMN BREAKING THE SPRING IN THE COLUMN AND KNOCKING OUT MY STEERING.  SO FAR NISSAN AND MY DEALER HAVE DONE NOTHING.  THEY HAVE REJECTED MY CLAIM THAT THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN ME A FORMAL ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO REPAIR.  THEY DID OFFER ME $500 OF TRADE IN VALUE TOWARDS A NEW VEHICLE PURCHASE.  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2009 I REQUESTED THAT THE VEHICLE BE REPAIRED AT MY COST.  I VISITED THE DEALER ON DECEMBER 1, 2009 TO CHECK ON PROGRESS, AND AS OF THIS AFTERNOON DECEMBER 4, 2009 THEY HAVE NOT PREPARED AN ESTIMATE.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL BRACKET WOULD PREVENT THE WHEEL WELL FROM HITTING THE STEERING COLUMN.

THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE WHEELWELL FRAME ASSEMBLY HAS RUSTED AND SEPARATED TO THE POINT THAT IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  IT IS AT THE REPAIR SHOP NOW, I AM WAITING FOR THE ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR COST, I'VE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT A MINIMUM OF $1500.  I HOPE OTHERS RESPOND AND COMPLAIN SO THAT MAYBE NISSAN WILL OWN UP TO MANUFACTURING A VEHICLE WITH DEFECTIVE METAL AND AT LEAST ISSUE A RECALL.  THESE VEHICLES ARE DANGEROUS AS THE ENTIRE WHEEL ASSEMBLY CAN COLLAPSE AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  I TOOK EXCELLENT CARE OF MY SUV, THE ENGINE AND THE REST  IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, BUT I WAS TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE RUST UNTIL I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP FOR STRUT REPLACEMENT AND THEY INFORMED ME OF THE CONDITION.  LUCKILY  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE HOME BUT THAT DRIVE HOME CAUSED MORE DAMAGE AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW THAT THE FRAME HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE REPAIR SHOP. I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD HAVE PUSHED THE ENTIRE TIRE ASSEMBLY STRAIGHT UPWARD AND THROUGH THE HOOD. PLEASE BE WARNED, AND MAKE SURE TO HAVE YOUR PATHFINDERS THOROUGHLY INSPECTED FOR THIS PROBLEM. *TR",
