        "summary": "On October 15, 2021, I was driving my 2016 Ford Transit Connect at approximately 55MPH on a state road. I was closing in on a slow-moving truck, and pressed the brake pedal just to slow down about 5MPH. At this point, the brake electronic control module failed, locking up the left front caliper, nearly pulling me into oncoming traffic. I was able to get stopped and pulled over to the side of the road, where I found the affected brake (left front) was smoking hot. I shut the vehicle off and waited for it to cool, and upon restarted, the brake ECM allowed the caliper to open enough to drive it home, and then directly to the repair shop. The repair shop determined the brake ECM was randomly locking up one of the four calipers about 1 in 10 times.   There were no warning indicators prior to the issue. The shop has all the details (Runyon Corp, PO Box 384/445, West Main St. Morristown IN, 46161, (765) 763-1271. They would have the old brake ECM. This issue occurred with 64,342 miles on the vehicle.   I have contacted Ford, and was told other, similar vehicles of the same year and model had a recall on the brake ECMs, but my VIN was not included in the recall.  This is a dangerous situation, and had I not had both hands on the wheel, it would have caused a head-on collision.",

THE ISSUE IS WATER ENTERING THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THRU THE TOW MODUEL AND SHORTING OUT THE SYSTEM. MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP BECAUSE THE IGNITION HAS COME APART AND IT IS GOING TO COST ME MORE THAT 800.00 TO FIX. MY PROBLEMS STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGE THE RADIO WENT OUT ALONG WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SCREEN, I CHECKED THE FUSES SEEMED FINE PUT THEM BACK ALL OK. A DAY LATER VEHICLE BEGAN TO MAKE A LOT OF NOISE COMING FROM THE DASH BOARD THIS TIME THE BATTERY WENT DEAD, I CHARGED THE BATTERY, CHECKED THE FUSES,  THE BATTERY STILL KEPT GOING DEAD. EVERY TIME I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF THE BATTERY WENT DEAD AFTER 3 OR 4 TIMES OF THIS THE IGNITION STOPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.  I THEN HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY PUT IN A NEW BATTERY AND RAN A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO FIND OUT THE IGNITION HAD COME APART AND HAD TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $800. I AM CONCERNED THAT WATER IS GETTING INTO MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND I AM GOING TO HAVE MORE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE IF THIS TOW MODULES ISN'T FIXED. THE FORD RECALL STATES: WATER INTRUSION INTO THE MODULE MAY RESULT IN RAPID FLASHING OF TURN SIGNALS, LOSS OF INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DISPLAY, LOSS OF HEAT AND AIR CONDITIONING CONTROLS, AND LOSS OF MULTIMEDIA INCLUDING RADIO, SCREENS AND SYNC. WIRING CORROSION FROM PROLONGED WATER INTRUSION COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN ELECTRICAL SHORT TO THE GROUND, WHICH COULD CAUSE SEAT BELT PRETENSIONER DEPLOYMENT, A BURNING SMELL AND/OR INCREASED RISK OF FIRE, INCLUDING WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED AND THE IGNITION IS OFF.
