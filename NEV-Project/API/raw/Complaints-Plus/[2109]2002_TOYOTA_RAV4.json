The brake pedal was depressed, and the vehicle spun 360 degrees and stopped on the opposite side of the road. No warning light illuminated. The contact called the independent mechanic who advised her to turn off the vehicle. The contact turned off and restarted the vehicle and drove the vehicle approximately 3-feet before the rear wheels locked up. The vehicle was towed to the independent mechanic and diagnosed with rear differential failure. The contact was informed that the rear differential needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired because the contact took the vehicle back to the used car dealer. The contact stated that the used car dealer stated that the mechanic did not diagnose the correct failure. The dealer's independent mechanic diagnosed the failure as a transmission transfer case failure. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 123,000.",

DEAR SIR:    I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IN JUNE 2015 WAS DRIVING MY 2002 TOYOTA RAV4 SUV AND I HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE THAT HAD RUN A STOP SIGN AND THE DRIVER VEERED INTO MY LANE AND HIT ME.  I WAS STUCK IN MY VEHICLE BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF THE COLLISION HAD PUSHED THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE BACK AND THE FRONT DOORS WOULD NOT OPEN AND PEOPLE STANDING AROUND SAID THAT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE.

THE VEHICLE THAT HIT ME WAS DRIVEN BY A LADY WHO WAS TALKING ON HER CELL PHONE AND DID NOT SEE THE RED STOP LIGHT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE AND SHE RAMMED INTO ME GOING  45 MPH. THE VEHICLE THAT HIT MY VEHICLE, ALL OF THEIR AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AND THE LADY DRIVING HAD NO INJURIES.  I AM STILL RECEIVING CARE FOR MY INJURIES.  MY VEHICLE WAS TOTALED.

HAVE GONE THROUGH 3 ECM'S, THE TRANSMISSION IS STILL SLIPPING BETWEEN 2ND & 3RD GEARS. [XXX] & THE TRANNY GUY TELLS ME IT IS THE COMPUTER. COMPUTER COMPANY SAYS IT IS THE TRANNY. SO MY CAR JUST SITS AT MY MECHANICS SHOP. IT CAN RUN BUT IF I RUN IT I RISK RUINING THE TRANSMISSION & IT NOT BEING COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.

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

THE DEALERSHIP QUOTED $989 TO REPLACE THE ECM (COMPUTER), BUT COULDN'T ASSURE THE TRANSMISSION WOULDN'T LATER NEED TO BE REPLACED.    TOYOTA CORPORATE WAS NOT HELPFUL.  I HAD RECORDS FROM THE PREVIOUS CAR OWNER THAT TOYOTA ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO REPLACE THE ECM FOR 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES AS A RESULT OF A CLASS ACTION SUIT, \"IF THEY FELT IT WAS WARRANTED.\"  I ALSO HAD DOCUMENTATION THAT THE ECM WAS \"REPROGRAMMED\" AT 72K MILES. MY CONTENTION WAS THE ECM SHOULD'VE BEEN REPLACED, NOT REPROGRAMMED, BUT WAS TOLD THAT THE REPROGRAMMING WAS DONE TO CORRECT A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.  I ASKED IF I COULD SPEAK TO SOMEONE ELSE AT CORPORATE AND WAS TOLD EVERYONE WOULD GIVE ME THE SAME RESPONSE SINCE IT IS THEIR COMPANY POSITION.   THE INTERNET IS FULL OF OWNERS WHO REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION FIRST, ONLY TO FIND THE ECM CAUSED THE NEWER TRANSMISSION TO FAIL ALSO, OR OWNERS WHO REPLACED THE ECM ONLY TO FIND THAT THE TRANSMISSION ALSO NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THEY HAVE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OWNERS BY CREATING A RECALL TO ALLOW OWNERS TO GET THIS FIXED PRIOR TO SCARY AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SHIFTING PROBLEMS.

IT THEN JERKED INTO GEAR AND I WENT ON.  IT SEEMED TO HAVE A PROBLEM SHIFTING INTO 3RD GEAR.  IT SEEMED TO HAPPEN WHEN PULLING AWAY FROM A STOP LIGHT AS WELL.  I TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP, WHO PUT HIS COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC ON IT.  HE SAID THE COMPUTER WAS NOT SHOWING AS BAD, SO HE REBUILT THE TRANSMISSION.  I GOT THE CAR BACK AND IT STARTED DOING THE EXACT SAME THING!  I TOOK IT BACK, HE REBUILT IT AGAIN, STILL WITH NO BAD COMPUTER CODES SHOWING.  STILL NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD REPLACED THE BURNED 3RD GEAR.  I PAID $2200 FOR THIS.  NOW IT NEEDS A $950 COMPUTER!  IT IS A 2002 AND I READ ONLINE THAT THESE VEHICLES HAD A TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND OWNERS WERE REIMBURSED FOR THIS.  MINE DID NOT ACT UP UNTIL THIS POINT.

I HAD SLOWED TO A STOP IN THE FAR LEFT LANE,OF 5 LANES, DUE TO SLOW TRAFFIC. WHEN TRAFFIC BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN, I ACCELERATED AND THE TRANSMISSION SEEMED TO BE \"SLIPPING\"; I REVVED THE ENGINE,BUT THERE WAS NO POWER GOING TO THE WHEELS. THERE WERE MANY CARS BEHIND ME BLOWING THEIR HORNS. THEN THE CAR BEGAN TO \"CLANK\" AND \"CHUG\" AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THE TRANSMISSION WAS GRINDING. I TURNED ON MY EMERGENCY FLASHER LIGHTS AND PULLED VERY SLOWLY OVER TO THE SHOULDER ACROSS 5 LANES OF TRAFFIC! I HAD SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS, BUT I MADE IT TO THE SHOULDER! THE CAR WOULD ONLY GO VERY SLOWLY, BUT THE LOUD NOISES STOPPED, SO I PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY AT THE NEAREST EXIT (WHICH WAS VERY CLOSE) . I WOULD HAVE STAYED ON THE SHOULDER IF THE CAR WAS STILL \"CLANKING\" FROM THE TRANSMISSION AREA, BUT THE NOISE HAD SUBSIDED. I FELT THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS MECHANICAL (TRANSMISSION) PROBLEM WITH MY CAR. I CALLED MY DAUGHTER AND ASKED HER TO DRIVE TO MY LOCATION. I WAS GOING TO CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK WHEN SHE ARRIVED. SHE ARRIVED IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND PUT IT INTO \"DRIVE\" AND ACCELERATED GENTLY. THE CAR SOUNDER PERFECTLY NORMAL, AND ACCELERATED AT A NORMAL SPEED WITH PLENTY OF POWER. WE DECIDED TO TRY TO SLOWLY DRIVE THE CAR HOME IF IT CONTINUED TO DRIVE NORMALLY. WE GOT HOME FINE, BUT JUST AS I WAS PULLING INTO MY PARKING LOT, THE CAR MADE LOUD NOISES AGAIN AND LURCHED A FEW TIMES AS I PULLED IN THE DRIVEWAY. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST TOYOTA DEALER THE NEXT DAY. THAT'S WHEN I BEGAN TO DISCOVER ALL THE PROBLEMS RAV 4'S HAD HAD WITH CLASS ACTION'S&ECM FAILURES.  *JS",

SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING THE CAR RACED FORWARD AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES TO AVOID A REAR-END COLLISION. AFTER IT WAS SAFE TO MOVE, I STEPPED ON THE GAS AGAIN AND THE CAR SLUGGISHLY MOVED AT ABOUT 5MPH AGAIN. THE WHOLE RIDE HOME (LESS THAN 5 MINUTES) THE CAR WAS EITHER SLOW OR FAST WITHOUT MUCH PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR.     UPON ARRIVING AT HOME AND TRYING TO PARALLEL PARK THE CAR, I NOTICED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLUGGISH AND MADE LOUD NOISE WHEN SHIFTED INTO REVERSE. THIS WASN'T NORMAL AND IT TROUBLED ME. I LOOKED UP ONLINE THE SYMPTOMS AND SAW THE TSB AND THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST TOYOTA. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION ON THIS. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HEARING ABOUT THIS.  OK 10 YEARS/150,000 MILES FROM 1ST DRIVE. HERE'S MY PROBLEM - I BOUGHT THE CAR IN 11/2001 - I AM OVER THE YEARS AND UNDER THE MILEAGE, SO I DON'T QUALIFY?    THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS SETTLED IN JAN/FEB 2012. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED THEIR CAR BEFORE JAN/FEN 2002 - ARE THE OUT OF LUCK?

TOYOTA NEEDS TO SATISFY THEIR CUSTOMERS BY ISSUING A RECALL AND ADMITTING THAT BOTH THE ECM AND TRANSMISSION NEED TO BE REPLACED ON ANY 2001-2003 RAV4 THAT EXPERIENCES ROUGH SHIFTING, OR SHIFTING IN & OUT OF GEAR, OR CODES THAT REFLECT A PROBLEM WITH THE ECM OR TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR DRIVERS AND TOYOTA IS NEGLIGENT IN PREVENTING INJURIES AND DEATHS DUE TO A KNOWN DEFECT.  *TR",

AT THAT TIME, I TOOK IT TO A SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED BOTH OF MY TOYOTAS. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ECM HAD TO BE REPLACED AND WOULD COST AROUND 1,300 DOLLARS. MIND YOU, I HAD TO PAY 75 DOLLARS FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC CHECK.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I TOOK MY RAV4 TO A LOCAL TRANSMISSION SHOP, HAD IT DIAGNOSED FOR A SECOND OPINION AND HE CONFIRMED THAT THE ECM UNIT WAS BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, WHICH COST ME YET, ANOTHER 75 DOLLARS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS.  HE ALSO INSTRUCTED ME NOT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE IT COULD POSSIBLY HARM THE TRANSMISSION.

TOYOTA HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL, NOR HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. I AM DISGUSTED THAT IN 2006 TOYOTA REALIZED THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE ECM, WHICH COULD RUIN THE TRANSMISSION.

ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER THE SAME PROBLEM. I GOT GAS AND THE SITUATION STOPPED.  SPORADICALLY, IN THE 2 WEEK TIME FRAME MY VEHICLE SEEMED TO LOSE POWER. I DID TAKE MY CAR INTO MY MECHANIC AND HE HAD THE CAR AND DID TEST DRIVES WITH NO PROBLEMS.  AGAIN, IN APRIL THE PROBLEM AROSE AGAIN AND THE CAR WHEN TO MY MECHANIC AND AGAIN THEY COULD FIND NO PROBLEM.    ON APRIL 22, 2010 UPON LEAVING WORK I STARTED MY VEHICLE AND THERE WAS A HORRIBLE JERKING, SHAKING AND AT TIMES SEEMED TO HAVE NO POWER I FINALLY WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME (1 MILE AWAY) WITH THE TIRES BARELY ROLLING DOWN THE ROAD.  IMMEDIATELY, THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND AS WE WERE DOING A TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEGAN THE JERKING, SHAKING AND LOST POWER, THE CAR WAS NOT OPERABLE ANY LONGER.    THE DIAGNOSIS:  TRANSMISSION BURNT AND NEW ECM (MY THIRD IN THIS VEHICLE).  THE VEHICLES ENGINE CHECK LIGHT NEVER CAME ON OR ANY OTHER SENSORS IN THE VEHICLE.  WHEN THE ECM WAS TESTED IT DID NOT DISPLAY ANY CODES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND WAS ADVISED I NEEDED TO BRING IT IN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT.  I EXPLAINED TO THEM IT DOES NOT RUN AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND WOULD THESE (I WOULD HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED WITH AN EXPENSE OF ANYWHERE FROM $250 TO $300.00, A HOURS DRIVE AWAY)  EXPENSES BE COVERED.  RESPONSE \"WARRANTY EXPIRED 60 DAYS AGO.\"      AFTER MANY DAYS OF AN AGONIZING DECISION, I ADVISED MY MECHANIC TO GO AHEAD AND FIX THE CAR AT THE TUNE OF $3500.00, REPLACING THE ECM AND TRANSMISSION.  THE VEHICLE IS STILL BEING REPAIRED AND I WILL HAVE IT BACK NEXT WEEK. *TR",

I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE ENGINE BUT TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION. I TOOK THE CAR TO TOYOTA THAT FRIDAY MORNING WHICH THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE COMPUTER AND MAYBE THE TRANSMISSION BUT FEW DAYS LATER I WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS STILL GOOD. (DON'T KNOW HOW TRUE THAT IS AND HOW THOROUGH   THEY'VE CONDUCTED THEIR INSPECTION).    WITH THIS INCIDENT AT 77,000 MILES, TOYOTA SHOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY COVERAGE OF THEIR COMPUTER AND TRANSMISSIONS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY HAD A TSB RELEASED MARCH 2006 WHICH I JUST FOUND OUT RESEARCHING FOR MY CAR'S POSSIBLE DEFECT. NOW I'M WORRIED THAT SINCE MY TRANSMISSION WAS ALREADY SUBJECTED TO THIS HARSH PROBLEM, IT'LL NO LONGER LAST... AND WITH JUST 6K MILES WARRANTY FOR THE NEW COMPUTER, I'M NOT FINANCIALLY READY TO BUY ANOTHER TRANSMISSION OR YET, ANOTHER CAR.

AS I WAS LEAVING WORK AT 5PM ONE FRIDAY, MY CAR WOULD HARD-SHIFT INTO FIRST AND STRUGGLE EVEN MORE TO GET TO SECOND, ETC.  I DROVE IT STRAIGHT TO TOYOTA CARLSBAD.  THEY CONTACTED ME THE FOLLOWING DAY AFTER CHANGING THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THEY SAID I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND COMPUTER.  COME TO FIND OUT THERE HAD BEEN A SERVICE BULLETIN IN 2006 THAT ONLY TOYOTA KNEW ABOUT THAT RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THIS WHEN I HAD THE TRANSMISSION SERVICED BY TOYOTA IN 2007.  THE TOTAL COST TO ME WOULD BE $4800 WITHOUT TAX, WHICH I COULD NOT AFFORD.  SINCE I NEEDED MY CAR FOR WORK AND I TAKE CARE OF MY ELDERLY MOTHER, I SCROUNGED TOGETHER THE NEARLY $2000 FOR THE COMPUTER REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS THE THERMOSTAT REPLACEMENT (THE IDIOT LIGHT CODE SAID IT HAD A LOOSE WIRE, AND NOT TOTAL REPLACEMENT!).  I WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION WOULD DEFINITELY NEED TO BE REPLACED IN A VERY SHORT TIME, AND THEY SUGGESTED I PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR VERY SOON.  THE SERVICE BULLETIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH ME, THE CLIENT.  THEY KNEW ABOUT AND KEPT THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM FROM ME AND NOW THE PROBLEM IS A COSTLY ONE TO REPAIR.  I WOULD LIKE TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FOR FREE AND REIMBURSE ME FOR MY COSTS TO REPLACE THE COMPUTER.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS RAV4 PROBLEM, I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A BIG AND CONTINUING PROBLEM FOR 2002 RAV4 OWNERS AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  I BELIEVE THAT THE COMPUTER (OR ECM) WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I AM HOPING THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  I PURCHASED THIS EXPENSIVE (FOR ME) TOYOTA BECAUSE IT WAS SAID TO LAST LONGER THAN OTHER VEHICLES.  I TRULY THINK THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT AND INCLUDED IN THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF TOYOTA. *TR",

THE COMPUTER THAT CONTROLS THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (PART # 89661-42820) CAN MALFUNCTION WITHOUT WARNING AND IN THE PROCESS DESTROY THE TRANSMISSION.  HE HAD RECEIVED TSB# TC002-06 FROM TOYOTA DETAILING THE ISSUE, AND HAS REBUILT SEVERAL TRANSMISSION FOR THE SAME REASON.  WE WERE STRONGLY ADVISED TO REPLACE THE ECM, A $1300 PART, OR OUR NEW TRANSMISSION WOULD LAST FOR ABOUT 30-50 MILES BEFORE COMING APART AGAIN.    AFTER REBUILDING THE 2ND AND 3RD CLUTCHES AND REPLACING THE ECM, OUR BILL CAME TO ABOUT $3500.  I REPORTED ALL OF THIS TO TOYOTA AND AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS TIME AND MUCH NEGOTIATION, THEY OFFERED ME A $1500 CUSTOMER RETENTION INCENTIVE, GOOD IF I BUY A NEW OR CERTIFIED USED TOYOTA IN THE NEXT 2 YEARS.

I REALIZED THEN IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THAT SOLD ME THE VEHICLE,AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, BUT THEY TOLD ME TO LIVE WITH IT BECAUSE IT WAS INTERMITTENT!

THE DEFECTIVELY DESIGNED ECM IS SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGES TO THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS CAUSES THE TRANSMISSION TO MALFUNCTION.  THIS PRESENTS TWO PROBLEMS:  OVER TIME IT DESTROYS THE TRANSMISSION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  ON TWO OCCASIONS I PULLED OUT IN TRAFFIC AND THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY (WITHOUT WARNING) REFUSED TO SHIFT FROM FIRST TO SECOND.  THIS HESITATION ALMOST CAUSED OTHER VEHICLES TO HIT ME.  IT FINALLY \"JERKED\" INTO GEAR AND I WAS ABLE TO AVOID THE COLLISIONS.  HAD IT NOT DONE SO, I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED.  IT IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE THAT TOYOTA HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM SINCE AT LEAST AS EARLY AS 2006 WHEN IT ISSUED A TSB TO IT DEALERS PERTAINING TO THIS EXACT PROBLEM.  I AM GOING TO BE HONEST.  I ALSO THINK IT IS A TRAVESTY THAT TOYOTA HAS NOT BEEN FORCED TO MAKE A RECALL.  TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE IS FLAT OUT WRONG.  JUST BECAUSE IT DOES NOT OCCUR ON THE \"OPEN HIGHWAY\" IS, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, LUDICROUS.  I CAN BE JUST AS SERIOUSLY INJURED IF MY CAR IS HIT BY SOMEONE GOING 40 MPH BECAUSE I CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR WAY.  NO PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED.

THEY RECOMMENDED ME TO CONTINUOUSLY DRIVE THE CAR, HOPING THAT THE CAR WILL ADJUST ITSELF TO THE NEW SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING THAT THEY USED.  I CONTINUED DRIVE FOR A WEEK WHILE CAREFULLY LISTEN TO MY CAR: THE \"HARD SHIFTING\" PROBLEM STILL EXIST.  THEN LAST NIGHT, THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN.  I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT MY CAR TO KOONS DEALER AT TYSONS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  AFTER CHECKING IT AGAIN, KOONS TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE \"ENGINE CONTROL MODULE\" (E.C.M.) AND RECOMMENDED ME THAT FIRST TO REPLACE THE E.C.M., AND IF THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE HARD SHIFTING PROBLEM, SECOND IS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION NEXT.  I THINK THIS PROBLEM DEFINITELY NOT CAUSE BY ME, RATHER BY KOONS AND TOYOTA MANUFACTURER.  NOW I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. *TR    DANIEL BUI",

MY ISSUE IS THAT THERE WAS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN SENT OUT TO ALL OF TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IT IS AS FOLLOWS:  TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN IS: TC002-06, REVISED MARCH 3, 2006:  \"SOME 2001 ? 2003 MODEL YEAR RAV4 VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE   MAY EXHIBIT A HARSH SHIFT CONDITION AND/OR M.I.L. ?ON? WITH DTC P0750, P0753, P0755,   P0758, AND/OR P1760 STORED. IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE ENGINE CONTROL   MODULE (ECM) (SAE TERM: POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE/PCM) MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO   REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS CONDITION OCCURRING. USE THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE\"    IT GOES ON TO SAY REPLACE THE ECM/ECU AND POSSIBLY THE TRANSMISSION.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT TOYOTA DID NOT NOTIFY ANY CONSUMER ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND NOW THAT MANY OF US ARE JUST NOW HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THIS AND AFTER RESEARCHING IT LEARNING THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE AND IT IS HAPPENING WITH MANY OF THE SAME MODEL CAR- MAINLY THE 2002.   I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA CORP. AS WELL AS THE DEALERSHIP WHERE MY CAR WAS PURCHASED.  I WAS TOLD THE COST TO REPAIR MY CAR WOULD BE A COSTLY $9,000.00.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TOYOTA INTENTIONALLY KEPT FROM CONSUMERS TO AVOID COSTLY REPAIRS TO THEMSELVES.  HAD I BEEN NOTIFIED I WOULD HAVE HAD THE ECU/ECM REPLACE IN 2006 WHILE MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.    THERE ARE 121 COMPLAINTS TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION.  THIS JUST STARTED WITH MY CAR 3 WEEKS AGO  I WAS ALMOST HIT BY ANOTHER CAR BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT SWITCH INTO GEAR ONCE I REACHED ABOUT 20 MPH AND AGAIN AT ABOUT 40 MPH...THE ENGINE REVVED TO ABOUT 6000 RPM'S AND JUST SAT THERE IF IT WERE IN NEUTRAL.  I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF DRIVING THIS CAR.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO OWN UP TO THIS PROBLEM AND ISSUE A RECALL.  I AM VERY UPSET AND FEEL I WAS NOT DEALT A FAIR HAND WITH THIS CAR - TOYOTA WOULD ONLY REPAIR THIS PROBLEM BASED ON A CUSTOMERS SPECIFIC COMPLAINT UNDER 80K MILES. *TR",

EVERYTIME I WOULD COME TO A STOPLIGHT, I WOULD BE DEATHLY AFRAID THAT MY CAR WOULDN'T START UP AGAIN AND THAT I WOULD BE HIT FROM BEHIND.  WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, IT WOULD SLOW DOWN ALL OF A SUDDEN AND THEN JERK VIOLENTLY FORWARD.  THIS HAPPENED EVERYTIME I DROVE.  ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 28TH I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND HE SAID THAT IT WAS A TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND RECOMMENDED A SHOP.  MY CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE TRANSMISSION SHOP GETTING REBUILT AT A COST OF $3,000+  I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT MY CAR AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION BUT WOULD SEND IT TO BE REMANUFACTURED AT A COST OF NO LESS THAN $5,000.  FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE WEB INDICATES THAT THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH 2002 RAV4 OWNERS AND THAT TOYOTA HAS KNOWN OF THIS FOR A WHILE BUT DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  APPARENTLY THE ISSUES IS WITH A FAULTY ECM THAT CAUSES THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES.  UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE TIME THE TRANSMISSION GOES OUT, MOST OF THE CARS ARE OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD AND THE COST IS LEFT UP TO THE CONSUMER.  MY FEAR IS THAT EVEN WITH THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED, IF THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE ECM, IT IS GOING TO RE-OCCUR AND I AM GOING TO INCUR ANOTHER STAGGERING REPAIR BILL.  I CALLED TOYOTA'S CORPORATE NUMBER AND SPOKE TO A CUSTOMER CARE REP WHO ADVISED ME THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS AT THE TIME ON THIS MODEL YEAR AND THAT I COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIS MANAGER AS THEY DO NOT TALK TO CONSUMERS.  I WANT TOYOTA TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ISSUE.  HAD THEY NOTIFIED THEIR BUYERS TO REPLACE THEIR ECM'S AHEAD OF TIME, THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE COSTLY REPAIRS DOWN THE LINE. *TR",

WHEN I BEGAN EXPERIENCING THESE PROBLEMS WITH MY 2002 TOYOTA RAV4 ON APRIL 17, 2009, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND NO MATTER HOW HARD I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR, MY CAR WOULD NOT GO.

I WAS TERRIFIED THAT I WAS GOING TO GET HIT EVERY TIME I HAD TO CROSS OVER A STREET WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION...SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT ONE OF THESE DAYS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN THIS BEGINS TO HAPPEN - THE CAR JUST WON'T GO AT TAKEOFF.  MANY OF US WHO OWN THE 2002 RAV4 HAVE WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON MISDIAGNOSIS OF THIS PROBLEM...I HAD THE TRANSMISSION FLUID FLUSHED, I HAD A TOP ENGINE CLEANING TO REMOVE BUILDUP IN THE THROTTLE, I WAS EVEN TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT MY CAR MAT WAS GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE ACCELERATOR AND THAT WAS ADDING TO THE PROBLEM.  ONLY AFTER NONE OF THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM DID THEY COME BACK AND FINALLY SAY THAT THE ECM NEEDED TO BE REPLACED OR THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE RUINED.  THIS REPAIR IS GOING TO COST ME $1300.00 BECAUSE THE WARRANTY RAN OUT AT 80,000 MILES AND MY VEHICLE IS AT 84,000 MILES.

WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD A BAD CATALYTIC CONVERTER, AND THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED BEFORE ANY FURTHER DIAGNOSIS COULD OCCUR. THE CC WAS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD, ALREADY HAVING BEEN REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. THEY HAD ALREADY REPROGRAMMED THE ECM. PER A TOYOTA SERVICE CAMPAIGN.  AFTER THE CC REPLACEMENT, CAR IS STILL NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY, AND IS GETTING WORSE. DEALERSHIP ADVISED US THAT WE NEED AN ECM REPLACEMENT, AT A COST OF $1300.  AFTER THE FACT, WE FOUND TOYOTA TSB TC002-06, WHICH DESCRIBES THE EXACT ISSUES OUR RAV4 IS HAVING. TOYOTA ADMITS IN THE TSB THAT THE ECM OF THE '01 THROUGH '03 RAV4'S CAN CAUSE THE HARSH SHIFTING THAT WE ARE SEEING, AND THAT TOYOTA MADE CHANGES TO THE \"MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS CONDITION OCCURRING\". THE RECOMMENDATION IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ECM. IT CANNOT BE REPROGRAMMED TO ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM.  THE RESULT OF THIS ECM FAILURE IS THAT THE CAR IS NO LONGER DRIVABLE, AS THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT SHIFT PROPERLY AT ALL, AND IT CONSTANTLY LOOSES TENSION ON ITS CLUTCH PACK, RESULTING IN LOSS OF POWER TO THE ROAD.   THE CONDITION GETS WORSE OVER A SHORT TIME. IN ONLY TWO WEEKS, THE CAR WILL NOT STAY IN ANY SINGLE GEAR WHEN DRIVING.   A SEARCH OF THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET FOUND MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. OFTEN, THE ECM FAILURE CAUSES PHYSICAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR FAULTY DIAGNOSIS, NOR WILL THEY MAKE TOYOTA HONOR THE WARRANTY, WHICH IS 80,000 MILES OR 8 YEARS. WE ARE UNDER THE YEARS, BUT OVER BY 8,000 MILES.

WHILE DRIVE THE VEHICLE HOME (AFTER THE REPAIRS), THE CAR WAS JUMPING/JERKING WORSE THAN WHEN WE BROUGHT IT IN.    WE IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT BACK WHERE IT WAS RE-EVALUATED AND WE WERE NOW TOLD THAT  ECM WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1589.00.    MY WIFE AND I DID SOME RESEARCH AND ARE FINDING THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN SEVERAL OF THE SAME TYPE OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND TOYOTA ITSELF HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THIS PRODUCT TO 96 MONTHS OR 80,000 MILES. WE FALL OUT OF THAT RANGE, BUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT (WHICH IS WHY TOYOTA PUT OUT THE NOTICE AND EXTENDED THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY) AND WE WOULD LIKE FIXED AS \"IN WARRANTY\".    THERE IS NO REASON FOR A CAR THAT HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED TO HAVE A FAILURE OF THIS KIND BEFORE 100,000 MILES.

MY COMMENT TO THEM WAS CONCERNING THE REAR DOOR, WHICH I HAD NOT USED THAT MUCH AND OVER THE LAST 6 MONTH MAYBE 3 TIME AT THE MOST PER WEEK, CERTAINLY NOT ALOT.  WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME WAS THAT THE DOOR HANDLE MECHANISM IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND SO IS THE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE. MY CONCERN AS A CONSUMER THAT TOYOTA DID NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE TO USE A PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE AND MECHANISM AND GIVEN THAT THINGS BREAK SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF 300.00 TO REPLACE.  I CONTEND THAT METAL PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF THE HANDLES.
