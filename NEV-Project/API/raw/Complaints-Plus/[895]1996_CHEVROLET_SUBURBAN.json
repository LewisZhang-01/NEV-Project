THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE FRONT BRAKE LINE HAD RUSTED OUT BECAUSE IT WAS MOUNTED AT THE FACTORY TO THE FRONT AXLE ON THIS 4-WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK CAUSING IT TO VIBRATE AND COLLECT DEBRIS ON IT LEADING TO A PREMATURE FAILURE DUE TO RUST.  IN DECEMBER 2012, AGAIN WHEN I WENT TO STOP FROM ABOUT 55 MPH ON THE FREEWAY, THE BRAKE PEDAL AGAIN WENT ALMOST COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR, BUT AGAIN I WAS ABLE TO STOP BEFORE HITTING ANOTHER VEHICLE BY USING THE PARKING BRAKE AND RUNNING UP ON THE SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THIS TIME THE REAR BRAKE LINE HAD RUSTED OUT AT THE \"T - INTERSECTION\" WHERE THE BRAKE LINE RUNS FROM THE FRONT MASTER CYLINDER TO THE REAR AXLE AND SPLITS INTO 2 LINES AT THE T INTERSECTION. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THESE TRUCKS AS IT WAS A BAD DESIGN, BECAUSE THE T LAYS IN A RECESSED HOLDER ATTACHED TO THE REAR AXLE, ALLOWING DIRT, SALT AND WETNESS TO ACCUMULATE IN THIS AREA AND CAUSE PREMATURE RUST AND FAILURE OF THE BRAKE LINES.  THIRD, LAST WEEK, WHILE DRIVING, I NOTICED A RAW GAS SMELL AND STOPPED THE VEHICLE. AGAIN I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AS GAS WAS POURING OUT OF THE FUEL LINE BY THE GAS FILTER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR WHEEL. THIS WAS TOWED TO A DIFFERENT MECHANIC'S REPAIR SHOP WHO AGAIN SHOWED ME THAT THE METAL FUEL LINE HAD RUSTED OUT DUE TO ITS BEING MOUNTED TO THE FRAME RAIL, CAUSING SALT, DIRT AND DEBRIS TO ACCUMULATE THERE ALSO. HE WARNED ME THAT THESE TRUCKS FREQUENTLY CATCH FIRE WHEN THESE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL INJECTION LINES RUST OUT.  HE SAID HE HAD SEEN 5 OF THESE TRUCKS BURNED IN JUST THE LAST 2 YEARS AT HIS SMALL SHOP.PLEASE HELP. THESE TRUCKS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUSLY DESIGNED TO FAIL.  *TR",

EARLIER THAT MORNING I HAD BEEN READING SOME OF THE NEWS THAT HAD BEEN POSTED ON THE INTERNET AND HAD COME ACROSS ANOTHER IN THE NEVER ENDING STORIES OF THE WOES OF FIRESTONE (TIRES). THE (BAD) NEWS HAD SPILLED OVER FROM THE FORD APPLICATIONS TO REFERENCE FIRESTONE'S STEELTEX R4S AND AT MODEL TIRES... THAT COME AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON, OF ALL THINGS, THE CHEVROLET SUBURBAN! I WALKED OUT TO THE GARAGE AND LOOKED AT THE TIRES THAT WERE INSTALLED ON THE \"NEW\" '96 AND FOUND THAT THE VEHICLE HAD LIKE NOW R4S TYPES INSTALLED ON ALL FOUR CORNERS! \"NAH, IT CAN'T BE\"  I SAID TO MYSELF. I HAD READ FURTHER, ON THE INTERNET, THE RESPONSE OF FIRESTONE TO THE NEW ALLEGATIONS WAS FIRESTONE BELIEVED THAT THE SAFETY BOARD/GURUS WERE ONLY BEGINNING THEIR INVESTIGATION AND THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANY REAL PROBLEMS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE R4S AND AT MODEL TIRES. WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE IN FIRESTONE (REINFORCED BY THEIR PUBLISHED STATEMENT) WE STARTED OUR TRIP TO YUMA. SEVENTEEN (17) MILES INTO THE TRIP, TRAVELLING AT 75 MPH (WHICH IS LEGAL SPEED LIMIT IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS), THINGS GOT REAL EXCITING. THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR STARTED TO \"THUMP\"  THE TIRE CAME APART, AND CONTROL BECAME \"DICEY\". WE WERE IN THE LEFTMOST LANE OF THE INTERSTATE WITH AUTOMOBILES TO OUR RIGHT SIDE AND BEHIND US. I GOT THE SUBURBAN TO SLOW ENOUGH, WITHOUT USING BRAKES, TO ENTER THE MEDIAN SAFELY AND REVIEW \"THE DAMAGE\". A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (STATE TROOPER) PULLED IN ALONG SIDE TO SEE IF WE WERE OK AND OFFER SOME ASSISTANCE. HE SEEMED TO THINK THAT WE WERE LUCKY NOT TO HAVE REALLY TAKEN A TUMBLE OR ROLLED THE VEHICLE. AN AVERAGE DRIVER WOULD HAVE LOST IT. WE RETURNED TO TUCSON AND IMMEDIATELY REPLACED ALL FIVE (5) FIRESTONE TIRES.*AK (DOT NUMBER: V611B1A378  TIRESIZE: LT24575R16)",

THE CRACKED FRONT TRANSAXLE CASING WAS ONLY DIAGNOSED AFTER THEY HAD REPLACED THE SEAL ON THE FRONT AXLE TWICE SINCE IT WAS ALWAYS LEAKING FLUID.  THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAD THE SEAL REPLACED 2 OR 3 TIMES BUT IT STILL LEAKS.  THE FUEL PUMPED FAILED ON OUR CAR LEAVING US STRANDED.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TRUCK NEEDS TO KEEP A 1/4 TANK OF GAS AT ALL TIMES IN THE TANK SO THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN.
