IMMEDIATELY WE ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN AND PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. FORTUNATELY TRAFFIC WAS NOT TOO CONGESTED AROUND US AND WE WERE DRIVING ON A RELATIVELY FLAT ROAD AT THE TIME. THE VEHICLE HAD LOST VIRTUALLY ALL BRAKING POWER AND THE WE BASICALLY HAD TO COAST TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE VEHICLE IS A 2016 FORD F-450 SUPER DUTY CREW CAB TOWING A 25' GOOSENECK TRAILER WITH ONLY 71,000 MILES ON THE TRUCK. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AN ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE HAD WE BEEN HAULING A HEAVIER LOAD AND DRIVING DOWN A DOWNHILL GRADE! THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARNING WHATSOEVER! FORD NEEDS TO FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE IT RESULTS IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY! *DT*JB",
