THE REPAIR SHOP GUESSED MY PROBLEM BEFORE EXAMINING THE CAR, STATING HE SAW IT ALL THE TIME.   HE SHOWED ME A PACKAGE OF SMALL PARTS FROM NISSAN CORP.WHICH HE SAID THEY SENT OUT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.  HE EXPLAINED NISSAN CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION  STYLE FOR APPROX. A 3 YEAR PERIOD (96-98?), USING A SOLENOID (I BELIEVE) THAT HE SAID \"FAILED IN ALL CARS MADE WHEN THE CARS REACHED 80,000 MILES.\"  HE SAID THE CARS MADE BEFORE AND AFTER THE 3 YEARS DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.    MY CAR WAS 3 1/2 YEARS OLD AND HAD 67,525 MILES. THE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTYDIDN'T COVER THE CARSINCE IT WAS MORE THAN 3 YRS OLD AND HAD MORE THAN 60K MILES.  PARTS REPLACED WERE TORQUE CONVERTER, BANNER KIT (NISSAN'S KIT), BAND, DRUM GEAR, SUN GEAR FRONT, PLANETARY GEAR SET FRONT AND REAR, AND 10 QRTS OF TRANS. OIL.  PARTS COST $909, LABOR  $360. DUE TO THE REPAIR SHOP'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY INSPECTION, THEIR POSSESSION OF 'NISSAN FIXER KIT', AND PROBABLE LRG % OF CARS WITH SAME PROBLEM, I THINK NISSAN BUILT A FAULTY CAR COMPONENT, KNEW ABOUT IT,AND EVEN DESIGNED THE TRANNY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE CAR ORIGINALLY. I EXPERIENCED NO ACCIDENT OR INJURY, BUT IF THE PARTS CAME LOOSE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD CAUSE VERY QUICK 'SEIZING' STOPS WITH NO WARNING (BRAKE LIGHTS), AND POSSIBLE PROJECTILE LIKE BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTS.

ON JUNE 8, 1999 THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN EVEN AFTER PUMPING THEM AND PUTTING THE BRAKE PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND, AND THE VEHICLE RAN INTO A FENCE IN ORDER TO STOP.  A POLICE REPORT WAS TAKEN AT THE SITE, AND BOTH POLICE OFFICERS AGREED THAT THERE WERE NO SKID MARKS AND IN FACT THIS COULD BE A MASTER CYLINDER PROBLEM. THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO A BODY SHOP AND REPAIRED (APPROX. COST $4000.00).   WEST VALLEY NISSAN IN GLENDALE AND PINNACLE NISSAN IN SCOTTSDALE BOTH EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND STATED THAT THEY DID NOT NOTE ANY FAILURES IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM OR MASTER CYLINDER.  IT WAS STATED THAT MR. MOORE, A NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE,  INSPECTED THE VEHICLE WITH THE SAME REPORT. THERE HAS BEEN NO EXPLANATION ON WHY THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK!  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST INCIDENT BUT THE SECOND!  BOTH THE POLICE AND A SERVICE ADVISOR AT PINNACLE NISSAN EXPLAINED THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER CAN IN FACT WORK INTERMITTENTLY.  MY BIGGEST FEAR IS PUTTING THIS VEHICLE BACK ON THE ROAD AND DRIVING AT A SPEED THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP SAFELY AND COULD EITHER CAUSE EXCESSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE, INJURY OR DEATH.   WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT I PURCHASED THE EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY ON THIS VEHICLE.  WHY DON'T THEY JUST CHANGE OUT THE MASTER CYLINDER INSTEAD OF THE POSSIBILITY AND LIABILITY OF ANOTHER ACCIDENT.
