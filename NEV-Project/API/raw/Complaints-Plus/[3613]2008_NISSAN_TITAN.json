Hitting me right next to my eye at a very high rate of speed. Causing trauma to my eye and surrounding tissue. Missing my eye by less than an inch. If I would have been looking straight ahead instead of slightly to the right where the collision was, I would have lost my eye. How did this manufacturer allowed a piece of metal be installed in front of the air bag is mind boggling. Air bags deploy at speeds of 200mph, launching anything in front of them at that speed. I was very lucky, I hope this agency can warn everyone who owns a Nissan vehicle with this design of a metal clip holding the emblem at the center of the steering wheel. I have photos of the emblem, clip, steering wheel, air bag, and my injury showing exactly how/where the clip hit me by the cuts it left on my face in the shape of the clip. I tried to upload photos but received an error from the website. If you could contact me I would like to send you the photos. They prove without a doubt the facts started above.

NOT ONLY DOES THIS MAKE THE DRIVER TRY TO PUMP THE BRAKES BUT THE TRAVEL IS SO LONG AS TO EXTEND YOUR LEG COMPLETELY AND STILL NEED TO COMPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL MORE. DIDN'T REALIZE THIS PROBLEM EXISTED UNTIL THE OTHER DAY WHEN I NEEDED TO PANIC STOP. ALMOST LOST CONTROL TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE PEDAL TRAVEL. ALSO WHEN BACKING MY BOAT INTO THE LAKE - CONSTANT PRESSURE MAKES THE PEDAL TRAVEL DOWN. THE BRAKES HOLD BUT I HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS \"MUSHY\" PEDAL. I HAVE RECENTLY REPLACED THE BRAKES, CALIPERS AND MASTER CYLINDER TO NO AVAIL. I GUESS I COULD REPLACE ALL THE BRAKE COMPONENTS BUT ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH IT WON'T HELP. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE NEWER VEHICLES OF NISSAN (NOT JUST TITAN) HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. HOW THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS I DON'T KNOW. ITS A PROBLEM YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT UNLESS YOU'VE DRIVEN THESE VEHICLES AWHILE..I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND BEING \"DEAD ENDED\" BY NISSAN. I'M 63, HAVE WORKED ON CARS MY WHOLE LIFE, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AS NO DOUBT MANY HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED BY THIS PROBLEM. I CANT SELL THE VEHICLE TO ANYONE ELSE KNOWING THERE'S NO SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. PS - FORD, CHRYSLER AND CHEVY DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE ONLY SOLUTION IT SEEMS IS TO MODIFY/REPLACE THE WHOLE BRAKE SYSTEM -- EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT - WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. PLEASE HELP.",

I NOW NOTICE THE EXACT SIMILAR PATTERN DEFECT IN MULTIPLE TITANS. THE CLEAR COAT IS WORN AWAY ALMOST DOWN TO THE METAL. I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN BUT THEY SAY UNLESS THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS THEY DO NOT HAVE TO ADDRESS IT. I REALIZE THIS IS NOT LIFE THREATENING, BUT I WANTED TO LODGE A FORMAL COMPLAINT BECAUSE IT IS A DEFECT THAT WILL AFFECT ME WHEN I GO TO TRADE IT IN AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I NOTICE WITH MOST OTHER TITAN OWNERS OF TRUCKS THIS AGE.  *TR",

HONESTLY THE TRUCK DOES VERY LITTLE BUT SHOW OFF THE DOGS WHEN THEY GET TO GO TO THE MARKET AND BACK. WE CALL AND TALKED WITH THE NISSAN REP. WHOSE NAME IS [XXX] WHO IS OUR DISTRICT MANAGER, HE SIMPLY TOLD US THAT THE WARRANTY WAS NO LONGER IN EFFECT AND WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES. I MENTIONED THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE SITUATION, HIS RESPONSE WAS I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT INTO THE DEALER FOR ALL OF ITS MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHEN I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD ALL THE MAINTENANCE AND SERVICES RECOMMENDED DONE THROUGH OUR SMALL BUSINESS LOCAL MECHANIC WHO BY THE WAY HAS MORE CERTIFICATES AND EXPERIENCE THAN HIS NISSAN TEAM HE ARGUED THE FACT. I SHARED HOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS CERTIFIED MECHANIC WHO PAYS FOR ALL OF HIS EXPENSES ON HIS OWN TO RUN HIS BUSINESS UNLIKE THE NISSAN TEAM WHO WORK UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE NISSAN DEALER, [XXX] AGAIN ARGUED THE FACT. WE HAVE THREE NISSAN VEHICLES ALL OF WHICH WE ARE NOW SELLING AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER NISSAN EVER. ITS A SHAME THAT NISSAN DOES NOT STAND BY THERE PRODUCTS. I ALSO READ WHERE THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE FRONTIER BECAUSE OF A RADIATOR LEAK THAT MIX WITH THE TRANSMISSION, INSTEAD OF A RECALL ON THE PROBLEM. PLEASE PEOPLE LETS BAND TOGETHER AND BOYCOTT ALL NISSAN PRODUCTS. 22,000 MILES SERIOUSLY.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)  *TR",

IT WAS REPLACED AND CONSIDERED A MYSTERIOUS BUT BENIGN INCIDENT.      RETURNING FROM AN 1200 MILE ROAD TRIP LAST WEEK, I TOOK MY TITAN IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE TO THE SAME AUTOMOTIVE SHOP.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT 4 OF THE 6 LUG NUTS WERE MISSING.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THEY WERE ALL BROKEN OFF ABOUT A 1/4\" FROM THE AXLE WHEEL MOUNT - ON THE SAME RIGHT REAR WHEEL.  THE MISSING STUDS WERE IN THE 10, 12, 2 AND 6 O'CLOCK POSITIONS - THE ONLY 2 REMAINING STUDS THAT PREVENTED A CATASTROPIC ACCIDENT INVOLVING MY SON AND ME WERE IN THE 4 AND 8 O'CLOCK POSITIONS!  IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE THAT WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN A DEADLY CRASH!!  ONE OF THE TWO REMAINING STUDS HOLDING THE WHEEL ON THE AXLE WAS ONE REPLACED PREVIOUSLY LAST FALL.   I HAD AIRED UP THE TIRES THE NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT ON THIS TRIP AND DID NOT NOTICE ANY MISSING LUG NUTS.    CLEARLY THIS WAS NOT A THEFT ATTEMPT FOR TWO REASONS:  A) WHY WOULD SOMEONE WHO COULD SIMPLY UNSCREW THE LUGS NUTS INSTEAD, WITH GREAT EFFORT, TWIST THEM OFF THE WRONG DIRECTION...AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE? AND B) TWICE IN SIX MONTHS ON THE SAME WHEEL?      INTERNET RESEARCH REVEALS SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS OF BROKEN LUG STUDS, EVERYONE SEEMING TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO AN ODD, ONE-OFF INCIDENT.  IT IS MY OPTION THAT THE STUDS ARE DEFECTIVE AND A RESULT OF STRESS FATIGUE.  ONE POST ON A NISSAN FORUM SITED SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY FOUND A CRACK IN ONE OF THE STUDS THAT HAD NOT YET BROKEN OFF.
