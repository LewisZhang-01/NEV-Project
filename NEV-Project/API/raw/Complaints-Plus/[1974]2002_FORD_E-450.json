AS A RESULT THIS COST US $7200.00 AND THE LOSS OF USE OF OUR VEHICLE AND HOME FOR 10 DAYS.

BUT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS OVER 6 YEARS OLD THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE.      WE FEEL THAT EVEN IF WE WERE COMPENSATED FOR THE PARTS WOULD BE A FAIR RESPONSE, BECAUSE THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LIABILITY LAWSUIT.
