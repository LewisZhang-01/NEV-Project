        "summary": "MY WIFE HAS A 2005 BMW X3 WITH AN AIRBAG WARNING INDICATOR LIGHT ILLUMINATED ON THE DASH. THE PROBLEM/SYMPTOM IS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE RED LIGHT IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AIRBAG IS DEPLOYED ALONG WITH A YELLOW LIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD THAT SAYS \"PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF\". SO IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY. THERE IS A SENSOR UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT THAT IS BASICALLY THERE SO THAT IF A PERSON THAT DOES NOT WEIGH A CERTAIN AMOUNT, LIKE A CHILD FOR EXAMPLE, IS SITTING THERE THE BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR SMALLER INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, SINCE THE SENSOR BECOMES DEFECTIVE, THE SYSTEM DEFAULTS TO AIRBAG OFF MODE AND THEREFORE YOU NEVER HAVE AN AIRBAG REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THEY COULD DO NOTHING FOR US BECAUSE THE VIN NUMBER DID NOT MATCH THE RECALL, BUT BMWUSA IS THE ONE THAT INDICATED THAT THERE IS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG LIGHT AND THAT IT WOULD BE COVERED REGARDLESS OF THE VIN MATCHING THE RECALL.  RIVERSIDE BMW HAS REFUSED TO HELP US WITH THIS MATTER BUT STATED THAT IF BMW OF NORTH AMERICA AUTHORIZED THE FIX, THEY WOULD REPAIR THE SEAT SENSOR MAT.  CAN YOU PLEASE HELP US RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH BMW.  THANK YOU,  MARK SULLIVAN",

(ONLY ONCE DID IT DO SO FOLLOWING A LIGHT RAIN; ON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY.) LUCKILY, NO ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES ENSUED.  I FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM THE YEAR I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE USED IN 2010; THE PREVIOUS OWNER LIKEWISE HAD NOTICED THE ISSUE AND INFORMED ME OF IT AT THE TIME I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. TODAY, SEPT. 15, 2014, MY LOCAL BMW DEALER PROPOSED REPLACING THE STEERING ANGLE SENSOR (SZL) IN OUR VEHICLE, SAYING A READOUT OF THE FAULT CODES DETECTED FAULTS IN THE SENSOR. I HAVE ELECTED TO REPLACE THE SENSOR AT A COST OF $1098.  BASED ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ISSUE, WHICH SOME CURSORY INVESTIGATING ON MY PART APPEARS TO BE A PROBLEM SHARED BY MULTIPLE OWNERS OF SIMILAR MODEL/YEAR VEHICLES, I URGE THE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE.

THEY CLEANED IT UP BUT DID NOT HAVE A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM. I CALLED MOTORWERKS BMW IN MINNEAPOLIS AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD I WILL GET A CALL BACK. I DIDN'T HEAR BACK AND CALLED AGAIN AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS.  I WAS ASKED TO BRING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE EARLIEST APPOINTMENT WAS JANUARY 24TH, 2011.

THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE WAS -22F. SHE MUST HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR ABOUT 2 MILES WHEN SHE SAW A HUGE WHITE SMOKE COMING OUT OF TAIL PIPE AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY STOPPED. WE GOT IT TOWED TO THE SAME SERVICE STATION AS BEFORE AND CALLED MY INSURANCE AGENT THE NEXT MORNING. THE AGENT DID SOME INVESTIGATION AND ADVISED US TO GET IT TOWED TO ANOTHER SERVICE STATION IN MOORHEAD MN THAT WORKS MOSTLY ON IMPORTS. THIS SERVICE STATION KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AS THEY HAD FIXED FIVE TO SIX OTHERS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. THEY GOT THE PARTS FROM THE MOTORWERKS BMW DEALERSHIP, FIXED THE PROBLEM AND I GOT THE VEHICLE BACK ON 1/27/2011. THEY ALSO MENTIONED THAT SOMEBODY HAD TRIED FIXING THE PROBLEM EARLIER BUT DID NOT QUITE FINISH IT. WE ARE THE ORIGINAL OWNERS OF IT AND HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN IT TO MOTORWERKS BMW IN MINNEAPOLIS FOR ALL WORK. THE TOTAL WITHOUT THE TWO TOWING WAS $1028.

CONSEQUENCE IN THIS SITUATION THE FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY EVEN IF A SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE ACCIDENT WOULD OCCUR AND OCCUPANT PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.    REMEDY DEALERS WILL REWORK THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SENSOR MAT SO THAT EXTERNAL FORCE APPLICATION TO THE SEAT DOES NOT CAUSE A CRACK TO THE MAT.

MY SYMPTOMS GOT WORSE ,MY THROAT WAS SWOLLEN, COMPLETELY LOST MY VOICE AS A DIRECT RESULT OF WHAT I BREATHED IN.  BMW LOOKED AT THE CAR & ADVISED OF  \"DEFECT IN THE EVAPORATOR HOUSING\" AND WHAT I AM  BREATHING IN IS \"MOLD DUE TO CONDENSATION.  ADVISED OF A KIT TO FIX IT. I REFUSED TO PAY. I CALLED BMW & THEIR CANNED RESPONSE WAS THIS WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY BUT \"ENVIRONMENTAL.\" I REFUSED TO GIVE UP, THE SERVICE MANAGER ADMITTED (OR SLIPPED) THAT BMW HAD AN INTERNAL MEMO CIRCULATING WITH EXACTLY WHAT TO TELL CUSTOMERS AND NOT TO COVER IT..  THE LOCAL SERVICE MANAGER AGREED TO EAT THE CHG. MY DR. DETERMINED  I HAD A DIRECT &FAST ALLERGIC REACTION. IT TOOK 4 WEEKS TO RECOVER.  FRIDAY WE HAD A RAIN STORM IN NJ.  I  DROVE AN HOUR ,COULD BARELY SEE AND  TURNED ON THE DEFROSTER. THE SMELL CAME OUT OF THE VENTS .I COULDN'T SEE,BUT I WAS SCARED OF GETTING SICK.  THIS BECAME A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION ON ROUTE 287 N IN NJ.  I  USED THE DEFROSTER FOR  LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.  ON THE WAY HOME I WAS TOO SCARED TO USE IT, STILL RAINING YESTERDAY (SUNDAY 5-18) IT WAS RAINING. I TURNED THE CAR ON PUT THE DEFROSTER ON & SAME THING HAPPENED. I HAVE THE  SYMPTOMS AGAIN BUT IT HAS NOT GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF MY THROAT CLOSING BECAUSE I KNEW TO SHUT IT OFF. THIS MEANS I CAN'T USE MY DEFROSTER, HEATER OR AIR-CONDITIONER OR I WILL GET VERY SICK.  I WILL CALL THE LOCAL DEALER TODAY WHO WILL TELL ME I CAN PAY TO HAVE THEM RUN LYSOL THROUGH THE VENTS.  I REACHED OUT TO BMW HEADQUARTERS THE FIRST TIME. THEY  IGNORED MY ISSUE EVEN WHEN I TOLD THEM I ENDED UP SICK, AT THE DR. & THAT I KNEW ABOUT THEIR INTERNAL MEMO.  MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE TO GET THIS MATTER ADDRESSED  ASAP.  IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME WHILE I AM DRIVING, DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFROST MY WINDOWS IN A STORM  THERE IS A CHANCE MY THROAT WILL CLOSE UP AND I  AN ACCIDENT.  *TR",
