This makes a few times now where I have parked my car and left, then when I returned my trunk was open.  The first couple of times I dismissed it because the trunk was only open slightly.  In one of the early instances I was standing there when the trunk opened by itself and thought it was because I hadn't closed it all the way.  But yesterday the trunk was open halfway with the taillight flashing bringing further attention to it.  There were no error messages or warnings (other than the taillight flashing).  Yesterday when this happened, my car was charging at a public charging station.  I suspect the taillight was flashing because the car was plugged in and charging.  The other times this happened, it was not charging.  This morning I googled Ford Fusion trunk opening by itself and saw multiple online forums with other Ford Fusion owners, who going back years, have been experiencing their trunks opening for no apparent reason.  Some of them said it happens while driving.  If my trunk were to open while I was driving the distraction would put myself and other drivers at risk.  There would also be a danger if items started to fly out of my trunk.  One of the forums suggested notifying the NHTSA about this issue.  I also messaged Ford about this issue asking about a fix.",
