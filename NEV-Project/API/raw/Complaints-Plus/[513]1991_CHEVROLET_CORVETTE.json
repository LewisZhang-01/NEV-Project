I then mounted those tire/wheel combinations onto the vehicle.  I then drove the vehicle to the same garage for a yearly state inspection, and on my way there the steering wheel shimmied half of the time.  When I got there I checked the lug nuts for any looseness with a torque wrench.  All lug nuts were accurate.  After the inspection I drove the car back to my garage (under 25 miles round trip) and removed all 4 tire/wheel combos, loaded them into my truck and brought them back to the garage to drop them off to have them balance checked in between the mechanics other jobs ahead of me.  The mechanic checked them and  informed me that all 4 were balanced accurately, as a matter of fact, he did them in front of me so I could see.  He recommended that I take them to a shop that has a \"Road Force Balancer\".  I found such a shop and after they tested all 4 tires, in front of me, they indicated that the 2 front could not be balanced, that they were \"out-of-round\" beyond balancing.  One rear combo was passable and the other was just barely out of reach, but could possibly be used.  It may even out after so many miles.  I asked him if the rims could be the problem and he indicated to me that the machine he uses also measures the wheel itself, and he showed me how it does it.  All 4 rims measured true. Thank you",
