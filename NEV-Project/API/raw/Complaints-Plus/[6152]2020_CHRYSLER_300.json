It is suppose to tilt a few degrees so that you can see noting is under your rear tires  such as a small child or o  pet cat, dog,etc. However this vehicle s mirrors tild down so far the only view you have is the  ground area directly under the drivers /passenger front door. You could see a child or pet  or even to safely back the vehicle up. I have taken this to the dealership they tell me there is no fix for this condition Is this something associated with just this car??? Or, have other vehicles had this problem??",
