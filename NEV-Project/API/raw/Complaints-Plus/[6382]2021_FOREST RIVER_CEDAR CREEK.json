        "summary": "While towing our 5th wheel cross country on a trip in July 2020 our front hydraulic jack legs starting coming down several times while driving and contacted the road surface which could have possibly resulted in loss of control. Some how the hydraulic system was applying pressure by itself while towing .I first tried disconnecting electrical power to the hydraulic system and keeping the jack legs up with a 400 lb rated ratchet strap and the legs would  still come down on its own with enough pressure to break the 400 lb rated strap. I was finally able to keep the leg secured up with 2 x 600 lb rated ratchet straps. While in Indiana we took our new 5th wheel to a Lippert componets service center and they replaced both front jacks and drained and replaced all the fluid under warranty. The service tech said this issue happened sometimes. Searching the internet it appears this a fairly common problem. This is a safety issue and Lippert should be responsible for coming up with a permanent solution.",
