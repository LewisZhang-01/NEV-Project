LAST NIGHT I WAS HAMMERED BY THE PRESENCE OF A NAUSEATINGLY INTENSE FUEL SMELL, BOTH INSIDE AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR HOURS OR IF I'VE BEEN DRIVING IT, THE SMELL IS EQUALLY INTENSE AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT, I AM FRIGHTENED FOR MY SAFETY. I HAVE NO RECOURSE WITH THE CAR LOT, \"AS IS\" SEEMS TO COVER SELLING ME A DEATH TRAP. NOW I FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THE EXACT MAKE AND MODEL OF MY VEHICLE BUT SOMEHOW VOLVO HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH NOT COVERING THE KNOWN ISSUE IN ALL BUT A FEW STATES. IS IT GOING TO REQUIRE A FIREY DEATH OF A FAMILY BEFORE THIS IS ADDRESSED?? THERE ARE POSTS ALL OVER THE INTERNET OF OTHER PEOPLE FACING THE SAME PROSPECT. I CANNOT AFFORD A NEW VEHICLE, NOW THAT I HAVE BOUGHT THIS ONE. I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE THE POSSIBLE MEANS OF MY DESTRUCTION.     THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED!!! WHY HAVE THEY NOT BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE? WHY ARE ONLY CERTAIN STATES INCLUDED IN THE RECALL??  *TR",
