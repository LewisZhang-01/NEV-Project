I was right next to a gas station and as I was pulling into the gas station, the engine died and would not restart. I had the car towed and then I proceeded to troubleshoot the problem. I did a fuel pressure test and found that there was no fuel pressure. I tested the fuel pump relay and found it to be operational. I accessed the primary fuel pump to check power and found the fuel pump wiring to be missing an inch of insulation on both wires and the insulation is brittle for another inch or two. There were two splices on the fuel pump wiring where recall #16V746000 was performed and a new connector was spliced in. Those two splices were melted together. Recall #16V746000 was a problem with the fuel pump connector melting due to loose wiring. I have concern that there is still an issue with the fuel system wiring overheating or the repair process is not adequate to solve the issue.",

FLOW BMW DIAGNOSED A LEAK IN THE RADIATOR. AFTER CONTACTING THE WARRANTY COMPANY (ASSURE) THE WARRANTY COMPANY INFORMED THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST OF A NEW RADIATOR ($1,300.00) BECAUSE IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THE LIMITED WARRANTY UNDER 'POWER TRAIN COVERAGE'.      THE RADIATOR IS ONE OF THE ENGINE'S UNSUNG HEROES. IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ESSENTIAL HEAT EXCHANGE FUNCTIONS IN YOUR CAR'S COOLING SYSTEM.     THE NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE AVERAGE CAR ENGINE IS AROUND 190-210 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND THERE IS STILL NO ANSWER.  NOW I GET SECOND RECALL LETTER ABOUT THE FUEL PUMP IN MY FUEL TANK.  I DO TRAVEL EVERY WEEK FROM CAPE COD MASS TO NEW YORK AND THERE IS STRONG SMELL OF GASOLINE IN MY CAR ON LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL, BUT ACCORDING TO BMW CAPE COD I WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PART TO BE AVAILABLE AND JUST NEED TO GET USED TO THE SMELL.  I TRY TO CALL AND ASK TO ORDER THE PARTS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED FROM THE RECALL LETTERS  AND FROM THE PARTS DEPARTMENT REPLIED THAT THEY CAN GET THE PARTS IN A DAY  OR TWO AS LONG AS I AM BUYING IT AS A REGULAR CUSTOMER, BUT AS SOON AS I TRY TO GET THE PARTS REPLACED AS A RECALL I GET A ANSWER THAT THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT.  WHEN I CONTACT BMW OF CAPE COD MASS THE ONLY THING I GET IS THAT I HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER LETTER - I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED FOR MY NAME, CAR VIN OR ANY OTHER INFO,  AND LOOKS LIKE THERE IS NOT INTEND THIS RECALL TO BE FIXED.    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY AND WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE FIXED UP.    THANK YOU.",

BMW STATES THAT SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ANALYZE THE FAILED COMPONENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO REASONABLE WEAR AND TEAR AND NOT DUE TO A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT.

        "summary": "MY WIFE HAD A HARROWING EXPERIENCE WITH THE 09 BMW-X5 LOCKING ITSELF WITH THE KEY IN THE CAR. REMOTE KEY WAS INSIDE THE CAR IN HER PURSE ON THE PASSENGER SEAT- UNTOUCHED BY ANYONE. CAR WAS PARKED WITH ENGINE OFF. CAR LOCKED ITSELF AFTER OUR TWO KIDS WERE SECURED IN THE BACKSEATS AND THEIR DOORS SHUT WITH MY WIFE OUTSIDE! IT WAS OVER 90 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO CALL FOR HELP.  MY 5 YEAR OLD'S ATTEMPTS TO OPEN THE DOOR RESULTED IN ALARM GOING OFF AND EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN. FINALLY, BY LUCK, SHE WAS ABLE TO GUIDE THE 5 YEAR OLD TO GET TO THE FRONT SEAT AND LOCATE THE KEY FROM THE PURSE AND UNLOCK THE CAR. IF IT WAS ONLY THE 2 YEAR OLD INSIDE, SHE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO BREAK THE WINDOW! THIS IS A REALLY SCARY SITUATION FOR A LUXURY CAR AND A BRAND NEW ONE. IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO US.  SURELY WE DO NOT WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS AGAIN AND WISH IT ON NO ONE ELSE! WE SUSPECT THAT IT HAD TO BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ELECTRONICS. IT HAS NOT OCCURRED AGAIN IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. THE REMOTE KEY IN THESE CARS ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOCK ITSELF WITH THE KEY INSIDE THE CAR AND THE DRIVER OUT! *TR",

WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO A NEAR OR ROLLING STOP AT APPROXIMATELY 2 MPH AND THEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY WHILE TURNING, THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO ROLL WITHOUT POWER FOR UP TO 3 SECONDS. SCENARIO: PULL UP TO AN INTERSECTION FOR A RIGHT OR LEFT TURN, SLOW TO A NEAR STOP, THEN ACCELERATE. THE VEHICLE JUST ROLLS FORWARD WHEN CROSSING TRAFFIC OR ATTEMPTING TO PULL AWAY QUICKLY. MEANWHILE, TRAFFIC IS APPROACHING YOU AT SPEED AND AN ACCIDENT COULD EASILY OCCUR. VOLKSWAGEN DIESEL VEHICLES HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THEIR DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) SYSTEM RECENT. THE KEY FACTOR MAY BE OPERATING UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHILE ATTEMPTING A TURN, WHICH INVOKES DSC. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SEVERAL TIMES SINCE PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE IN AUGUST 2009. *TR",
