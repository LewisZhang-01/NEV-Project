In every instance, I had to restart the car 2-5 times and hope that the system would correct itself. Usually it did not, and I would just have to wait for hours or even days before the entertainment system would spontaneously begin functioning again.   When it happened in September, I brought the car in and demanded that something be done. After a day, a service advisor called me and said the previous repair from a year ago was done incorrectly, which led to recurring problems with the wiring harness.

        "summary": "My 2020 Honda Pilot has stalled 4 times in the past two weeks after the auto engine idle occurs at a red light. The engine will shut off automatically, but when I lift my foot from the brake, the car engine does not turn back on, and the car shifts into park, and acts as if stalled. In order to get the car to restart, I have to power down completely, open the driver side door(!!!) and \u201creset\u201d the whole system before I can apply the brake and press the ignition button. Even then a couple of times it doesn\u2019t start for me doing that, and I have to cycle through the entire process a second time. This happened to me with my 3 children in the car twice on very busy (50mph) roads, and is incredibly dangerous.   The second major issue I have noticed, but less frequently (about 3-4 times in the past 6 months), is that the auto braking system will randomly alert and apply the brakes while I\u2019m driving down a straight road with no traffic in front of me! Needless to say, terrifying. This thankfully only lasts a few seconds before I regain control of the car, but also incredibly dangerous.   I am scheduling service with Honda to evaluate ASAP, but I have read *many* accounts of the exact same problem online and every single person says Honda has never been able to find any cause. Some say replacing the battery helps, others say the stalling issue remains after battery replacement.   If we can\u2019t solve this problem, or have the auto engine idle completely and permanently disabled, I will be selling this car very soon. 16,104 miles driven as of today.",

There appears to be hundreds (or thousands) of 2020 and other year Honda Pilots where the Infotainment system is failing.  It begins with \"pops\" & \"crackles\" and just keeps getting worse.  Also, intermittently, you will get error messages or a blank screen which could be dangerous.  The problem comes and goes which makes it even more frustrating.  I have personally taken my 2020 Pilot Elite (MSRP near $50,000) into my local Honda dealer 4 times already.  Ten days after the most recent \"repair\" it has started all over again.  In the past they have admitted they really don't know how to fix it and just keep replacing harnessing and wiring.  They want me to bring it in AGAIN for a 5th time.  Why should I bring it in when they clearly have no fix? The Pilot was purchased from Shottenkirk Honda (Cartersville, GA) in May 2020 and currently has around 30,000 miles on it. . My father lives in another state and he asked his local Honda dealer if they knew of the issue.  They quickly admitted they did and again, admitted they don't know how to remedy it.  If you do any simple research you will see it over and over.  You can start with this simple Google search: honda pilot infotainment problems. As I said, I haven't found anyone who states it's been fixed permanently.  I do appreciate the efforts and kindness of my local dealership (Shottenkirk) but at what point will Honda step up and do something of substance to fix the issue or replace the vehicles? This, in my opinion, is not a \"Shottenkirk\" problem, it is a \"Honda\" problem.  I have tweeted Honda North America and Honda Customer Service and  simply got a reply that says they've created a file and will look into it.",

THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS FLASHING AND WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN EXIT RAMP CLOSE AND WE COASTED OFF ON THE EXIT RAMP LIMITED TO 5 MPH.  ALL ELECTRONICS WERE ON (RADIO AND DVD), BUT THE CAR FORCED US TO A STOP.  WE CALLED THE HONDA SERVICE LINE BECAUSE THIS CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY INFORMED US NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR AT THIS TIME WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON.  WE SAT IN THE CAR WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON AND PULLED OVER FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES.  THEY RECOMMENDED TURNING THE CAR OFF FOR 10 MINUTES, LIKE MANUAL SAID, AND THEN RESTART THE CAR TO SEE IF WE CAN DRIVE TO SAFETY.  WE DID THIS AND THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS OFF AND WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE TO A SAFE LOCATION.  100+ MILES AWAY FROM OUR HOME, WE TOOK IT TO A HONDA DEALER.  THEY DID AN INSPECTION OF THE CAR AND ATTEMPTED TO READ THE SYSTEM TO FIND OUT WHY THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THEY WROTE UP A DETAILED REPORT AND SAID THAT THE ENGINE LIGHT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON LONG ENOUGH TO GET A READ/REPORT, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE LOOKED OK.  THEY DID WRITE IN THEIR REPORT THAT THERE IS A KNOWN BULLETIN FOR A FUEL INJECTION PROBLEM.  THEY SAID THEY RECOMMENDED IT, BUT THAT THE ENGINE LIGHT WOULD NEED TO BE ON LONGER TO JUSTIFY RECALL.      AND LASTLY, I WANT YOU TO BE AWARE THAT THIS CAR, SINCE PURCHASING NEW, HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP OR NOT CORRECTLY WORKING FOR 4+ MONTH OF THE YEAR WE HAVE OWNED IT.  THE DVD PLAYER, INFORMATION ELECTRONIC SCREEN SYSTEM BROKE AND NEEDED REPLACED.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD LOUD CRACKING AND POPPING NOISE AND IT REQUIRED A CABLE WITH PROPER SHIELDING TO BE REPLACED.",

THE POPPING NOISE HAPPENS WHETHER OR NOT MUSIC IS ON.  I ALSO STARTED HEARING THIS WEIRD NOISE THAT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS A COMPRESSOR IN MY VEHICLE.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON SEVERAL HONDA PILOT THREADS AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE AC COMPRESSOR AND THE SPEAKERS. APPARENTLY THE WIRING HARNESS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. I'VE LOOKED OVER THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND SEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SPEAKERS POPPING ISSUE.  I HAVE NOT TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER YET, I DONT COMPLETELY TRUST DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTERS AND THEY PREY ON CUSTOMERS AND OVER CHARGE AND MAKE YOU THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE.  I LIKE TO DO MY RESEARCH PRIOR TO TAKING MY CARS TO ANY REPAIR SHOPS. I ALSO VIDEO AND VOICE RECORDED ALL THE WEIRD SOUNDS THAT THE PILOT IS MAKING. HONDA NEEDS TO FIX THIS, IF THIS IN FACT IS A WIRING ISSUE, THIS CAN POSSIBLY CAUSE A SHORT OUT THUS A SAFETY ISSUE. I WILL BE PRINTING OUT SEVERAL OF THESE COMPLAINTS AND SHOWING THEM TO THE DEALER BEFORE THEY TRY TO SWINDLE ME OUT OF AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF MONEY.

ON MY WAY BACK, I STARTED HEARING CRACKLING NOISE COMING FROM THE SPEAKERS, ALL WHILE LISTENING TO RADIO AND 'GOOGLE MAPS' DIRECTIONS. THE CRACKLING NOSE BECAME MORE SEVERE/PERSISTENT, THEN THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM SHUT OFF; FIRST DISPLAYING \"NETWORK CONNECTION LOST\", THEN OFF COMPLETELY. AT SOME POINT, AFTER THE CENTER INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM DISPLAY WENT OFF, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ALSO SHUT OFF (ONLY DISPLAYED ENGINE TEMPERATURE AND GAS FILL LEVEL). YES, WITH MY KIDS STILL IN THE CAR... WHY WOULD HONDA KEEP ON SELLING VEHICLES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE DEFECTIVE IN THIS WAY? VERY LIKELY PART OF THE REASON IS TO HELP JUST CONTINUE TO HELP THEMSELVES AND THEIR POCKET BOOKS, ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF MY KIDS' SAFETY. NICE GOING HONDA CORPORATES!! PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR KIDS THEN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING!     IN THE PAST WEEKS SINCE THE VEHICLE PURCHASE, SEEMS I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME AT THE DEALER (3 TIMES, 4TH TIME SCHEDULED... AND THRESHOLD FOR 'LEMON' LAW) THAN WITH MY KIDS. THE SERVICE MANAGER (ANDREW NEUFELD) AND PERSONEL AT GARCIA HONDA  ARE VERY ATTENTIVE BUT HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO FIX THIS ISSUE.      SO I'M STUCK WITH A VEHICLE I DON'T DARE TO DRIVE WITH MY KIDS IN DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS. I TEND TO BE LESS OPTIMISTIC THAN MOST BUT A FAIR CONCERN OF MINE IS THE FOLLOWING: HONDA DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSES THE ISSUE, NOR CAN THEY FIX IT. DO THEY KNOW WHAT ALL IS REALLY AFFECTED? ARE OTHER SYSTEMS (OR SYSTEM OUTPUTS) IMPAIRED? WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM LANE DEPARTURE AND FRONT COLLISION WARNING WHEN THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DECIDE TO SHUT OFF?

IF THE ROAD IS COMPLETELY STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH, I DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS WHOLE ORDEAL IS SCARY BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE DISTRACTION FOR ME AND I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGAIN TODAY THAT HONDA IS AWARE AND WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. HE STATED A RECALL IS COMING OUT FOR IT AS WELL AS THE ODYSSEY AND PASSPORT BUT THEY ARE MAKING THE PARTS FOR IT BEFORE THEY RECALL IT. HE SAID THEY CAN PUT A BAND-AID ON IT IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL THE PART CAN BE MADE. SINCE THIS IS THE 2ND TIME IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS, I'M WORRIED THEY ARE COVERING UP THE ISSUE AND WAITING FOR MY WARRANTY TO BE UP.

THE CAR WILL THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A COLLISION WHEN THERE'S NOTHING IN FRONT OF IT. NOW TODAY, MY HUSBAND DID THE REMOTE START AND WHEN HE GOT OUT TO THE VEHICLE, ALL THE WINDOWS WERE HALF DOWN AND THE SUNROOF HALF OPEN! WE HAVE THE WARRANTY, I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH OUR DEALER FOR SERVICE BUT HERE'S THE THING...AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE I HAVE DISCOVERED THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT APPARENTLY HAS NO SOLUTION?! THIS IS VERY DISCOURAGING AND DISAPPOINTING. OUR BRAND NEW PILOT THAT WE LOVED IS NOW A SOURCE OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. HONDA, WHY CONTINUE ROLLING OUT VEHICLES KNOWING THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH YOUR INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM??? MY LOVE OF HONDA IS RAPIDLY SOURING.",
