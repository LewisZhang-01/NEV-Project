I PULLED OUT AND DROVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FEET AND PARKED. I CALL A MECHANIC AND I DROVE IT AGAIN FOR A MILE TO THE SHOP. HE OPENS UP THE HOOD AND POUR IN SOME COOLANT AND ALL THE COOLANT WERE ON THE FLOOR. HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT COOLANT LEAKS AND OIL IS PROBABLY MIXED  AND CAUSES THE ENGINE FAILURE. HE TOLD ME I HAD TO CHANGE THE ENGINE, BECAUSE FIXING IT WILL COST ME OVER TEN GRAND. I DROVE IT HOME, THEN THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I TOOK TO A DIFFERENT SHOP, THEY DID THE DIAGNOSIS AND RELATE THE SAME STORY THAT CHECK CODES SHOWED THREE CODES: P0016, CRANK POSITION SENSOR CORRELATION BANK ONE SENSOR A. 1285 CYLINDER HEAD OVER TEMPERATURE, 1299 CYLINDER HEAD TEMP PROTECTION.  THE CODES INDICATE AN OVERHEAT SCENARIO THAT RESULTED IN ENGINE SHUT DOWN. THEY CHECK OIL AND FOUND MILKY SUBSTANCE INSTEAD OF OIL. PRESSURE CHECK FOR COOLANT LEAK PUSHED MILKY OIL OUT OF DIPSTICK TUBE. HEAD GASKET HAS FAILED DUE TO OVERHEATING AND THE COOLANT HAS CONTAMINATED THE ENGINE OIL. THEIR RECOMMENDATION IS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE, ASSEMBLY AND FLUSH COOLING SYSTEM. THEIR TOTAL ESTIMATE IS $10,900.  I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR THIS SERVICE REPAIR. I CANNOT EVEN SPEND THAT MUCH OF MONEY ON ANOTHER CAR. WE BOUGHT THIS CAR THINKING THAT IT WILL TAKE US FOR SOME TIME BEFORE WE'LL NEED ANOTHER CAR.

UPON PAYING HEFTILY WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR, THE CLICKING OF THE DOOR LOCKS HAD STOPPED BUT THE UNLOCK BUTTON STILL WOULDN'T WORK AND THE ALARM WAS ONCE AGAIN GOING OFF! NOW THE CAR IS STILL AT THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND HAD ITS BCM/BCU REPLACED FOR A SUPPOSED 'FIX', I'M SUPPOSE TO PICK IT UP TOMORROW. SO I GUESS WE'LL SEE. THE APPARENT PROBLEM FROM ALL OF THIS? MY CX9 HAS A SUNROOF, WHICH MAZDA KNOWS THESE VEHICLES DON'T DRAIN PROPERLY WHICH CAUSES WATER TO GO TO THE BCM SHORTING IT OUT! THIS IS INEXCUSABLE AND COULD VERY WELL COST SOMEONE'S CHILD THEIR LIFE BECAUSE OF THE DOORS CONSTANT LOCKING AND UNABLE TO UNLOCK SOMETIMES MANUALLY.

(CURRENT CASE WITH CX-9 AND FORD EDGE -2008)  2)  TANK IS SECURED USING TRADITIONAL TANK STRAPS  THE FORD EDGE TANK (THE SAME AS CX-9) WAS RECALLED IN CASE 1 BECAUSE THE BOLTED FLANGE IS PART OF THE TANK. AFTER REPEATED FLEXING OF FRAME AND TANK WITH THE ADDITION OF CORROSION IN NORTHERN STATES, THE FIXED FLANGE RUPTURES THE THANK CAUSING SUDDEN FUEL LOSS ON A TANK THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE CORRODED.  THIS IS OF COURSE A LARGE LIABILITY AS BRITTLE FATIGUE FRACTURE IS BY NATURE SUDDEN.  THERE IS NO WARNING FOR THE CUSTOMER. THEY PULL INTO THEIR GARAGE AT HOME OR WORK AND ARE A SUDDEN HAZARD.  IN CASE 2, A TRADITION METHOD OF SECURING A TANK, THE LOAD IS DISTRIBUTED ON A STRAP. SHOULD THE STRAP FRACTURE THERE IS NO SUDDEN FUEL LOSS. THE STRAP CAN BE REPLACED. THE TANK STAYS SEALED.  THIS DESIGN FLAW HAS RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ENOUGH ISSUE THAT FORD HAS RECALLED OVER 200,000 VEHICLES IDENTICAL TO THE CX-9 TO ADDRESS THIS EXACT ISSUE.  FORD AND MAZDA SHARE NOT ONLY THE SAME DESIGN, BUT THE SAME TANK MANUFACTURER AND CHASSIS.    THE MAZDA ISSUE IS MORE SERIOUS AS COATED TANKS DO NOT SHOW ANY WARNING SIGNS OF CORROSION. WHERE SALT AND BRINE ARE USED IN NORTHERN US DURING THE WINTER THESE TYPES OF COATINGS DO NOT REDUCE CORROSION. THEREFORE, THE NATURE OF THE TANK RUPTURE IS SUDDEN FATIGUE FAILURE WITH NO WARNING AND POSES A CERTAIN RISK OF FIRE IN AN ENCLOSURE SUCH AS A HOME GARAGE.    FAILURE WAS - SUDDEN, UNABLE TO BE DETECTED AND LIFE THREATENING",

THE CAR WAS IMMOBILIZED, AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAY OF OTHER TRAFFIC IN THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, CAUSING CHAOS IN THE PARKING LOT AND CAUSING THEM TO TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN AN ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE PARKING LOT WHILE THEY STRUGGLED TO TOW THE CAR OUT OF THE WAY.  THE CAR WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TOWED TO A MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND THE TIRE ARMS AND BALL JOINTS WERE REPAIRED PURSUANT TO A RECALL (8515G).  THE FRONT TIRES WERE ALSO UNEVENLY WORN AND REPLACED, VERY LIKELY FROM THE BALL JOINT / STEERING ARM ISSUE, AND COST $481.55.  MAZDA WOULD NOT REIMBURSE FOR THE TIRES BECAUSE I COULD NOT LOCATE RECEIPTS TO PROVE I HAD ROTATED THE TIRES AT THE APPROPRIATE INTERVALS, SPECIFICALLY STATING \"OUR DEALER WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM IF THE WEARING OF THE TIRES WERE DUE TO THE RECALL ITEM AS THERE WAS NO SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION INDICATING THE PROPER MAINTENANCE ON THE TIRES\".  I DO NOT BELIEVE MOST PEOPLE KEEP RECORDS OF EVERY OIL CHANGE / TIRE ROTATION THEY HAVE DONE, BUT THE WEAR WAS VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED FOR BALL JOINT ISSUES.  FURTHERMORE THE CAR HAD BEEN INSPECTED BY THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, AND NO UNEVEN WEAR WAS FOUND AT THAT TIME, GIVING FURTHER INDICATION THAT THE UNEVEN WEAR WAS LINKED TO THE BALL JOINT / TIRE ROD ISSUE.  FORTUNATELY THIS DID NOT OCCUR ONE DAY EARLIER WHILE TOWING A BOAT ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY DISABLED SON, THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN A MULTI FATALITY ACCIDENT.
