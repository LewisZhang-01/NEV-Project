I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED SO MUCH IF I WAS ACTUALLY PRESSING THE BRAKES, HOWEVER I DIDN'T TOUCH A THING.  I WOULD ALSO TAKE ALL THE BLAME IF THE WARNING LIGHT HAD COME ON AT ALL, BUT NO WARNING EITHER.  WE SPENT HOURS JUST TRYING TO GET THE THING INTO LONG-TERM PARKING.  CHEVY IS TELLING ME TO BRING THE CAR IN AND BE CHARGED $80.00/HOUR BUT MY MOTHER AND I JUST ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ANSWER.  I WANT TO BE TOLD FROM A, HOPEFULLY, NUETRAL PARTY AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO.  THE CAR HAS REMAINED PARKED SINCE THE INCIDENT.  MY MOTHER INFORMS ME THAT EVEN IF THE CAR WAS REPAIRED SHE WOULD STILL BE TO AFFRAID TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE.  AS I WOULD NOT WANT HER TO DRIVE THIS DEATH TRAP EITHER.

I HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS IT WAS BROUGHT USED FROM A DEALERSHIP IN WOODBRIDGE, VA.  THE DEALERSHIP NAME IS EASTERN OF WOODBRIDGE.  THIS CAR HAD A SOME MECHANICAL DEFECTS WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THAT I WAS NOT AWARE UNTIL AFTER I SIGNED THE PAPER.  BUT EVEN BEFORE I SIGNED THE PAPER I DID NOTICE SOME THINGS LIKE THE TIRES WERE BALD AND THE CAR HAD BEEN IN ACCIDENT.  I INFORMED THEM OF SOME OF THE DEFECTS AND THEY REFUSED TO FIX THEM.  I HAVE A PAPER STATING THAT THE CAR HAD PASSED INSPECTION BUT I HAD TO REPLACE THE BRAKES 2 WEEKS AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR.  LIKE I SAID THE CAR HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE ALIGNMENT ON THE VEHICLE WAS EXTREMELY BAD AND IF I DROVE CAR OVER 45 MILES THE CAR SHOOK UNCONTROLLABLY.  I STILL HAVE A CAR NOTE ON THE VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH THE HAS BEEN PRONOUNCED TOTAL.  GETTING BACK TO WHAT I WRITING FOR, THE CAR WAS PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD BECAUSE THE BRAKES JUST LOCKED AND WOULD NOT MOVE.  SO I PUT MY HAZARD LIGHTS AND WAS WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK, WHEN A VEHICLE CAME BY AND WENT ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD TRYING TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE AND SLAM RIGHT INTO MY CAR.  THE PERSON THAT WAS DRIVING MY CAR WAS SERIOUSLY AND PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL AND IS NOW SEEKING MEDICAL CARE.  WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THERE ANYWAY POSSIBLE THAT I CAN FIND OUT IN THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE BRAKES FOR THAT VEHICLE.  IF I COULD PLEASE! PLEASE! GET SOME INFORMATION ON WHAT DO ABOUT THIS SITUATION.  MY INSURANCE IS GOING TO PAY THE WHOLE CAR NOTE OFF.  THE ACCIDENT WAS NOT MY FAULT THE BRAKES SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.
