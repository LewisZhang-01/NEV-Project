THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED BY DODGE UNDER WARRANTY.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED IN JANUARY OF 2015.

A COUPLE DAYS AFTER PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE I NOTICED WHAT CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS ENGINE \"SURGE\" WHEN CRUISING AT 35-45 MPH IN CITY TRAFFIC. IN ADDITION I ALSO FOUND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE \"SURGE\" IS TO ACCELERATE HARDER. THIS REQUIREMENT OF HARDER ACCELERATION IN HEAVY CITY TRAFFIC CAN UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD, AS OCCURRED WITH ME ON AUGUST 27, 2007. ON THIS DAY I WAS CRUISING ALONG AT ABOUT 40 MPH IN MY DAKOTA,  DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, WHEN MY ENGINE BEGIN TO ?SURGE?  I STEPPED ON THE  GAS PEDAL A LITTLE HARDER TO GET RID OF THE ?SURGE? WHEN AT THAT VERY MOMENT TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF ME CAME TO  ABRUPT HALT. THIS ABRUPT HALT IN TRAFFIC ALMOST CAUSED ME TO REAR-END THE CAR AHEAD OF ME. HAD I BEEN ?TAILGATING? THE CAR AHEAD OF ME IN THE MOMENTS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING, BEFORE APPLYING HEAVIER THROTTLE, IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT I WOULD HAVE REAR-ENDED THE CAR AHEAD OF ME. *JB    ON AUGUST 30, 2007 I TOOK MY NEW DAKOTA BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM CORRECT THE ?SURGING? PROBLEM. AT THE END OF  THIS REPAIR APPOINTMENT  THE GEWEKE?S SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT  THEY CONSULTED WITH THE CHRYSLER ENGINEERING GROUP AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS ?NO? FIX FOR THE ?SURGING? PROBLEM, WHICH I HAD EXPERIENCED WITH MY NEW VEHICLE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT THE ENGINEERING GROUP AT CHRYSLER FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT I WORK-AROUND THE ?SURGING? BY ACCELERATING ?QUICKER? WHEN I AM IN THE 35-45 MPH SPEED RANGE.  I FIND THEIR SUGGESTION NOT ONLY DANGEROUS, BUT IMPRACTICAL AS WELL, BECAUSE MOST OF MY DRIVING IS IN THIS SPEED RANGE, DURING HEAVY CITY TRAFFIC.     WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHRYSLER DO IS TO IMMEDIATELY COME UP WITH A ?FIX? FOR THE DAKOTA. OR IF THEY CAN NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, REPLACE MY DAKOTA WITH AN EXACT REPLICA WITH THE SAME OPTIONS, MINUS THE ?SURGE? ISSUE.  *JB",
