HOWEVER, AFTER THAT, THE PEDAL LOSES PRESSURE AND NEEDS TO BE PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO GET THE CAR TO STOP. THIS ISSUE CAN BE FIXED BY ACTIVATING THE ABS SYSTEM AGAIN AND COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP. HOWEVER, WHEN BRAKING OVER A BUMP AGAIN THE ISSUE CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.     IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ISSUE HAS RECENTLY STARTED TO BECOME WIDELY REPORTED FOR MAZDA3, MAZDA6, AND FORD FUSIONS. I AM SEEING THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OPENED IN DECEMBER 2016 FOR THE FORD FUSION AND THE MERCURY MILAN. I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THAT THIS DEFECT IS ALSO EVIDENT IN MAZDA'S AS WELL.     THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION AS TO WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM AND IT SEEMS MOST PEOPLE GO AND REPLACE THEIR MASTER CYLINDER, CALIPERS, BRAKE PADS, ECT. IN ORDER TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WENT TO FILL TIRES WITH AIR BECAUSE THEY APPEARED TO HAVE LOW AIR PRESSURE.  EACH TIME, AS SOON AS I APPLIED SLIGHT PRESSURE FROM THE AIR HOSE TO THE VALVE STEM, THE VALVE STEM DISINTEGRATED AND WAS PUSHED INSIDE THE TIRE.  IT TOOK VERY LITTLE PRESSURE TO PUSH THE STEM INSIDE THE TIRE.  THE TIRE THEN IMMEDIATELY DEFLATED BECAUSE AIR ESCAPED THROUGH THE OPEN HOLE.  THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS STATIONARY (BECAUSE I WAS FILLING THE TIRE WITH AIR).  BUT, JUDGING FROM THE FACT THAT ONLY A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF PRESSURE WAS NEEDED TO PUSH THE VALVE STEM INTO THE TIRE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED VERY EASILY WHILE IN MOTION AT ANY SPEED.  I FEEL THAT IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT I WAS NOT WARNED ABOUT AT ANY POINT AND, AFTER TELLING THE COMPANY ABOUT IT, I FEEL THAT MY CONCERNS WERE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY.   *JS",

IT IS INFURIATING THAT I HAVE TO INSTALL A \"SAFETY FEATURE\" THAT WILL RANDOMLY CAUSE ME TO LOSE CONTROL OVER MY CAR IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

YOU SEE, THE PUMP (AN ITEGRAL PART OF THE STEERING AND VEHICLE SAFETY CONTROL SYSTEM) IS MOUNTED OUTSIDE THE CAR'S FRAME, JUST FORWARD OF THE PASSENGER FRONT TIRE.  IT IS BASICALLY JUST BEHIND THE PASSENGER HEADLIGHT/FOGLIGHT/BUMPER/QUARTER PANEL ASSEMBLY.

WHAT BROUGHT THIS TO MY ATTENTION WAS WHEN A DEER RECENTLY RAN INTO THIS VERY LOCATION AND RENDERED THE VEHICLE UNCONTROLLABLE AND THEREFORE UNDRIVABLE.  MY DAUGHTER (WHO SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION) WAS DRIVING THE CAR AT THE TIME AND WAS VERY SHOCKED AND SURPRISED  THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS TECHNICALLY DRIVABLE (MINUS QUARTER PANEL, LEADLIGHT/FOGLIGHT AND PART OF THE BUMPER COVER) SHE COULD NOT PHYSICALLY STEER THE CAR.

THE CONDITION SEEMED TO CLEAR ITSELF SO I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND WENT A FEW HUNDRED FEET.  THE SLUGGISH STEERING AND FLASHING WARNING LIGHTS BEGAN AGAIN.  I STOPPED THE CAR, LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING AND CHECKED THE TIRES, POWER STEERING BELT, AND POWER STEERING FLUID LEVEL. ALL WERE OK.    AT THIS POINT I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND REMOVED THE KEY. THE SPEEDOMETER AND TACHOMETER NEEDLES OSCILLATED WILDLY FROM END TO END FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE ALSO ON.   AFTER WAITING FOR THE INSTRUMENTATION TO SETTLE TO THE NORMAL OFF STATE, I INSERTED THE KEY AND ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE. THERE WAS NO ELECTRICAL POWER WHATEVER, LIKE THE BATTERY HAD BEEN REMOVED.    I REMOVED THE KEY WAITED 15 SECONDS AND ATTEMPTED TO START THE ENGINE AGAIN.  THAT TIME THE CAR STARTED AS EXPECTED. I DROVE THE CAR SLOWLY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO RECURRENCE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES SINCE THEN WITH NO RECURRENCE OF THE STEERING ISSUE OR FLASHING WARNING LIGHTS.",

I CONTINUED DRIFTING TO THE RIGHT UNCONTROLLABLY, STRUCK A ROAD SIGN, AND ULTIMATELY ENDED UP IN A DITCH. THIS ALL OCCURRED 12 DAYS AFTER I TOOK THE CAR TO THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE RECALLED POWER STEERING PUMP. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN ONLY 12 DAYS AFTER THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND PUMP LINE WERE REPLACED. I WONDER IF THE PUMP HAD INDEED BEEN REPLACED OR IF A NEW PUMP WAS INSTALLED CORRECTLY. OR MAYBE THE NEW PUMP IS JUST AS DEFECTIVE AS THE OLD PUMP!!!  IT WILL COST $8,000-$10,000 TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE AND I AM NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE $1,000 INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE. THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE SIDE IMPACT AND HEAD AIRBAGS WERE DEPLOYED AND THAT I WAS NOT INJURED BADLY.  I FEEL THAT MAZDA SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HOW THEY HAVE HANDLED THIS RECALL. I HAVE READ MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE AND OTHERS AND THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM.    *TR",

TODAY WAS THE MOST RECENT, THE SECOND TIME WAS ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO, AND THE FIRST TIME WAS ANOTHER 3-4 MONTHS BEFORE THE SECOND TIME. THE LAST TWO TIMES I WAS PARKED, STARTED THE ENGINE, TRIED TO DRIVE AND REALIZED THE POWER STEERING WAS OUT. WITH GREAT PHYSICAL EFFORT I WAS ABLE TO REPARK THE CAR, STOP THE ENGINE, AND AFTER ABOUT 10-20 MINUTES THE POWER STEERING BEGAN WORKING WHEN THE ENGINE WAS STARTED AGAIN. THE FIRST TIME THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT WHILE I WAS DRIVING. LUCKILY I WASN'T DRIVING IN A LOT OF TRAFFIC AND WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A NEARBY BUSINESS. IT TOOK GREAT PHYSICAL EFFORT TO TURN THE CAR AND I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STEER THE CAR AND FIND A SAFE SPOT TO PARK IF I HAD BEEN IN LOTS OF TRAFFIC OR DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS AND RESULT IN CRASHES. I WAS LUCKY THAT ALL THREE TIMES I WAS EITHER DRIVING SLOW OR PARKED. *TR",

I HAVE A 2008 MAZDA3 PURCHASED NEW IN EARLY APRIL 2008. BASICALLY, THE POWER STEERING HAS GONE OUT TWICE ON ME - THE VEHICLE IS STILL FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND THE WARNING LIGHT DOES GO ON, BUT IT JUST REQUIRES A LOT OF MUSCLE TO TURN ON THE CAR. BOTH TIMES, IT WAS ON A WARM DAY (I LIVE IN CHICAGO) AND TOWARD THE END OF A RELATIVELY LONG COMMUTE (1 HOUR 15 MINUTES+) OF MOSTLY STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, SO I WONDERED IF IT MAY BE HEAT-RELATED BUT THAT COULD ALSO BE COINCIDENCE. THE FIRST TIME, I DROVE IT THE REMAINING MILE OR SO AND WAS ABLE TO PARK IT. AFTER RESTARTING THE CAR, POWER STEERING STILL DIDN'T WORK. WHEN I CAME LATER (EITHER A FEW HOURS OR THE NEXT DAY), IT WAS FINE. SECOND TIME WAS SIMILAR, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE BETTER MENTAL NOTES OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED IT - THIS TIME, IT WENT OUT SHORTLY AFTER I CUT THE WHEEL ALL THE WAY TO ONE SIDE WHEN THE CAR WAS PRACTICALLY STATIONARY. AGAIN, HARD TO TELL IF THAT WAS WHAT TRIGGERED THE PROBLEM OR IF IT WAS SHEER COINCIDENCE ... THIS TIME, THOUGH, I PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE CAR OFF FOR JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND WHEN I RESTARTED IT, IT WAS FINE. NOT SURE WHAT ELSE YOU MIGHT NEED TO KNOW... I AM UP-TO-DATE ON MY SERVICING AND THE FIRST INSTANCE OCCURRED ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AFTER SERVICE AT MAZDA (A WEEK IN WHICH I HADN'T REALLY DRIVEN THE CAR SINCE WE WERE ON VACATION WITH OUR OTHER CAR). I HAVE NOT YET CONTACTED MAZDA ABOUT THE PROBLEM, I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT NEXT TIME I BROUGHT IT IN. *TR",

I HAD THE ALIGNMENT CHECKED AT THE DESTINATION AND IT WAS WITHIN MFG. SPEC.

NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES AT THE TIME, THINKING MAYBE IT WAS A OVERZEALOUS SALES EFFORT, AND TO ME THE TIRES STILL LOOKED USABLE I DIDN'T REPLACE THEM.

MAZDA GIVES NO EXPLANATION, ONE SAID SHOULD ROTATE @ 5K MILES, ANOTHER SAYS THEY PUT CRAPPY TIRES ON THE VEHICLE.

THE RESULTS CAME BACK POSITIVE WITH A .075PPM (ALMOST EXACT FEMA TRAILER LITIGATION AVERAGE). THIS TESTING WAS DONE ON A 60 - 65 DEGREE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE DAY. THE FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS SEEM TO GET WORSE THE WARMER IT GETS. I TOOK CAR TO DEALER, DEALER INSPECTED, WROTE IT UP AS AN AIR LEAK - COULD NOT DUPLICATE. I FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH MAZDA. I SOUGHT HELP FROM THE BBB. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER TOOK THE CAR AND DID NOTHING. THE DEALER WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME ANY PAPERWORK PROVING I HAD THE CAR THERE. THE DEALER TOLD ME I NEED TO CONTACT MY AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY FOR REPAIR. I DID AND THEY STATED THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BAD PRODUCT.
