WE TOOK THEM TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THEY ALL STARTED LEAKING REAR END OIL.  THEY PUT THE PART ON THEM, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED.  THE LEAK HAD STOPPED ON ALL OF THEM, BUT THE GRINDING NOISE STILL REMAINED.  WE HAD TO LET ONE OF THEM GO BACK BECAUSE IT WAS SO BAD.  THE OTHERS ARE STILL DOING HORRIBLE.
