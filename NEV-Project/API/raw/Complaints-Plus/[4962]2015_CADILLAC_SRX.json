Please look into this matter and do what is right by the consumer. Thank you  [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

It is very hard to navigate driving especially when other drivers can barely see my car. I have driven over curbs, crossed lane lines, and have been unable to see turning lanes. Other cars have have had issues seeing my car due to the low lights and this has led to some other very close calls. The situation is very unsafe and risky. The malfunctioning of the lights have pretty much rendered my car useless after dark or in rainy weather.   I have spoken to numerous individuals at both the local dealership and GM to no avail. I have been told so many different stories and given differing plans of actions. The dealership people told me to wait on a letter from GM/Cadillac. After weeks, ai contacted GM/Cadillac who also told me to wait on a letter. After another few weeks and still without a letter, I contacted GM/Cadillac again and that's when the real \"runaround\" began. Two years later, my headlights are even worse and I don't really drive my car that much out of fear. I continue to contact GM/Cadillac at least once or twice a month to no avail.

TOOK BACK TO AUTO SHOP AND AFTER AN INTENSE INSPECTION, DISCOVERED THE ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. LOOKING ON THE INTERNET, WE DISCOVERED THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MANY OTHER CADILLAC SRXS. I WROTE A LETTER TO GM DESCRIBING MY SAFETY CONCERNS WITH THE VEHICLE. I WAS CONTACTED BY A CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON, WHO IN TURN, PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH A LOCAL CADILLAC DEALER. THE DEALER THEN PUT ME THROUGH TO THEIR SERVICE REP, WHO TOLD ME THEY COULD DO NOTHING FOR ME, THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED. ALL REPAIR WORK WOULD BE OUT OF POCKET. THE SERVICE REP TOLD ME THAT GM HAD SENT OUT LETTERS TO CADILLAC OWNERS REGARDING THE HEADLIGHT REPAIRS, AND THAT THE TIME HAD EXPIRED. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T OWN THE CAR AT THAT TIME, SO I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY LETTER, AND THE PREVIOUS OWNER EVIDENTLY DIDN'T HAVE IT REPAIRED. THE COST TO REPLACE THE BOTH HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES IS $1,950.00. SINCE THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM OF DRIVING AT NIGHT WITH LOW VISIBILITY, I AM REQUESTING THAT NHTSA HELP GO TO BATTLE WITH GM AND DEMAND A RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ON ALL CADILLAC SRX VEHICLES BEFORE THERE ARE ACCIDENTS, OR WORSE YET, A DEATH, CAUSED FROM THE LACK OF VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT.

I WAS TOLD TO WAIT FOR A LETTER AND THEN COME BACK. AFTER WAITING A FEW WEEKS, I CALLED THE CADILLAC/GM NUMBER AGAIN AND WAS TOLD TO WAIT FOR THE LETTER AS THEY WERE STILL PROCESSING. FAST FORWARD, I HAVE CALLED IN TOO MANY TIMES TO RECALL BEING TOLD VARIOUS THINGS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY CAR WAS NOT IN THE REIMBURSEMENT PLAN, . WAS TOLD I MISSED THE TIME FOR MY REIMBURSEMENT. I WAS TOLD TO WAIT BECAUSE I WOULD BE I'M THE NEXT ROUND OF LETTERS. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO NEXT ROUND OF LETTERS. I WAS TOLD THAT OF I DIDN'T RECEIVE A LETTER, THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. I WAS TOLD THAT EVEN IF I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET A LETTER BUT NEVER GOT ONE, IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE TIMEFRAME IS OVER. AGAIN...MORE CALLS. THEN AN ADVISOR LEFT A VOICEMAIL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO OFFER ASSISTANCE. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THAT GM HAD OFFERED TO PAY CLOSE TO $800, BUT WHEN THEY PUT IN A CALL THE SERVICE WAS DENIED. AFTER SUBSEQUENT CALLS, I WAS GIVEN THE RUN-AROUND YET AGAIN. TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS TOLD TO TAKE MY CAR TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC ON THE HEADLIGHTS/HEADLAMPS.

I ALSO FEAR RUNNING OFF THE ROAD BECAUSE I CAN BARELY SEE THE LINES. I HAVE CONTACTED MY DEALER, AND AM WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE AND MANY PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE SRX MODELS 2010-2016. THEY REPORT ISSUES ON FORUMS AND SOME HAVE EVEN EXPERIENCED ROLLOVERS AND ENDING UP IN DITCHES DUE TO LIMITED VISIBILITY AT NIGHT. MANY OLDER PEOPLE DRIVE CADILLACS AND THEY HAVE EVEN HAD THEIR DEALERSHIP QUESTION THEIR EYESIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN A CLASS ACTION SUIT ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT APPARENTLY IT HAS BEEN DROPPED IN ALL STATES BUT FL AND CA. I WORK FOR A MAJOR TRUCK MANUFACTURER AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO INVOLVE ON SUCH SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES AS THIS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AS MANY FORUMS HAVE REPORTS OF PEOPLE SAYING GM IS UP FOR A SUIT IF THEY END UP HAVING A FATAL CRASH FROM THE DIM LIGHTING. I HAVE ALSO READ THAT GM REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. EVEN WHEN THE HEADLAMPS ARE REPLACED BY THE DEALER, THE ISSUE IS REPORTED TO RETURN. I DOUBT THE HEADLAMP QUALITY ISSUE HAS EVER BEEN ADDRESSED WITH ANY KIND OF MODIFICATION TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BY GM.  READ THIS FORUM FOR MORE REPORTS OF THIS ISSUE HTTP://GMAUTHORITY.COM/BLOG/FORUM/CADILLAC-FORUM/. I TRUST YOUR AGENCY WILL SERIOUSLY EXAMINE THIS ISSUE.",

THE DEALER QUOTED ME ~$300 TO REPLACE WITH NON-GM BULBS BUT CAN'T GUARANTY THAT THE PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED AND WON'T GIVE ME ANY SORT OF WARRANTY ON THE REPAIR--EVEN THOUGH MY SRX IS STILL UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY. IN FACT, EVERY ONLINE REVIEW STATES THAT REPLACING THE BULBS WILL NOT CORRECT THIS ISSUE. OBVIOUSLY, THE DEFECT GOES BEYOND THE BULB ITSELF. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE SRX. A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH RETURNS THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS COMPLAINING OF THIS SAFETY PROBLEM WHICH GM FAILS OR REFUSES TO REMEDY. NHTSA, PLEASE INTERVENE HERE AND MAKE GM PERMANENTLY FIX THIS DEFECT, WHETHER THAT MEANS REPLACING THE ENTIRE HEADLAMP ASSEMBLY, OR NEW SEALS, OR NEW BULBS WITH SOME SORT OF WARRANTY. MY SAFETY, AND THAT OF MY CHILDREN AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD, IS AT GREAT RISK UNTIL THIS DEFECT IS CORRECTED.

I'VE HAD THIS CAR 3 WEEKS AND AM LIVID THAT NOBODY AT THE LOCAL CADILLAC DEALER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE HEADLIGHT PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR! I HAD GONE THROUGH CONSUMER REPORTS, BLUE BOOK VALUES ET ....I THOUGHT THAT I HAD ADEQUATELY DONE MY RESEARCH! THEN... I GOOGLED 2015 CADILLAC SRX HEADLIGHTS ! THE INFORMATION WAS ALL THERE...HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS. CLASS ACTION SUITS AND A RECALL ON THEM IN CALIFORNIA! SOMEONE WILL BE KILLED DUE TO THESE LIGHTS.",

I REPLACED THE HALOGEN LIGHTS WITH NEW HALOGENS AND NO DIFFERENCE. I THEN UPGRADED HALOGENS TO LED BULBS WITH A MINIMAL FIX. PLEASE TAKE THESE ISSUES SERIOUSLY. PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN ONLINE THAT THEY CANNOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE AT NIGHT. THE ONLY SAFE MEASURE IS TO DRIVE WITH HIGH BEAMS, WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS PROBLEM IS SYSTEMIC WITH THE LUXURY EDITION CADILLAC SRX. I THINK IT'S THE LENS OR ELECTRICAL. I THINK THIS IS THE REASON THAT THE 2016 SRX HAS HID HEADLIGHTS. NUMEROUS WEBSITES INDICATE COMPLAINTS FROM DRIVERS WHO SAY THAT THE CADILLAC DEALERSHIPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE BUT ALSO SAY THAT GM HAS NOT ISSUED A FIX. DEALERSHIPS WANT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS UP TO OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIX IT, BUT THEY ALSO STATE THAT THE FIX MIGHT NOT WORK. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS. IT IS TRULY A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. PLEASE HOLD GM ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THIS PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN DRIVING.

I WAS PUT IN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION, AS I COULD NOT USE MY BRIGHT LIGHTS BECAUSE THAT WOULD \"BLIND\" THE CARS COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  THIS WAS A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION AS ONE WRONG MANEUVER COULD SEND YOU OFF THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN OR HEAD-ON INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE OR PEDESTIAN.  UPON MY RETURN TO FLORIDA, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM AS FOG AND HAZE COVERING THE LENS DUE TO \"WEATHER\" AND REPLACED BOTH HEADLAMPS.  ON MAY 13, 2018, I NOTICED THE SAME HEAD LAMP DIMNESS WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE ROAD OR PEDESTRIANS OR ANYTHING.  I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE HEADLAMP AND REPLACED IT.  THIS HAS BEEN LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE THE INITIAL REPLACEMENT.  CLEARLY THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THE DESIGN AND/OR INTEGRITY OF THESE HEADLAMPS AND A NEWER VERSION MUST BE MANUFACTURED.  I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND IF MOISTURE IS CAUSING THIS, THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM.  THIS IS VERY COSTLY TO FIX, NOT TO MENTION, LIFE THREATENING AS YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE THE ROAD OR PEDESTRIANS OR  ANYTHING ELSE WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT WITH BARELY ANY LIGHT ILLUMINATING THE PATH IN FRONT OF YOUR VEHICLE.",
