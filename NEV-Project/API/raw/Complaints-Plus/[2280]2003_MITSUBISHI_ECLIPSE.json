MITSUBISHI HAS DESIGNED THE WAVE SPRING AS A FRAGILE TWO COIL PIECE WHICH HAS BEEN KNOWN TO REPEATEDLY BREAK CAUSING CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN THE TRANSMISSION. THIS IN TURN POSES A THREAT ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS. WHEN THIS WAVE SPRING BREAKS, ACTUAL PIECES OF THE WAVE SPRING MAKE IT THROUGH MITSUBISHI'S ALSO FAULTY TRANSMISSION FILTER AND LODGE THEMSELVES IN THE PUMP GEAR, CAUSING THE GEAR TO ACTUALLY BREAK. AFTER THE PUMP GEAR HAS BEEN BROKEN INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION, ALL FORWARD AND REVERSE GEARS IMMEDIATELY STOP FUNCTION AND IN MOST INSTANCES THE VEHICLE SHUTS OFF. THIS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL HARM OR EVEN DEATH OF THE DRIVER AND/OR PASSENGER AS THE VEHICLE LOSES ALL MOVING POWER WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WITH OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. MITSUBISHI HAS RECENTLY CREATED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE WAVE SPRING WITHOUT ISSUING A RECALL, WHICH NOW IS A ONE PIECE INSTEAD OF THE COIL SETUP AND HAS A LESS CHANCE OF BREAKING. TO MANY MITSUBISHI/DODGE OWNERS THIS UPDATE WAS DISCOVERED AFTER THEY HAVE HAD THEIR VEHICLE IN A TRANSMISSION SHOP WITH A HEFTY BILL TO PAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS MITSUBISHI'S FAULT FOR ENGINEERING A FAULTY PART IN THEIR TRANSMISSION. ALL ONE PERSON WOULD NEED TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS SEARCH THE INTERNET WITH THE TRANSMISSION CODE (F4A51) AND THIS ISSUE IS WELL DOCUMENTED, EVEN RESEARCHED BY TRANSMISSION DIGEST (A SPECIALTY MAGAZINE). NOT ONLY IS THIS A LARGE INCONVENIENCE TO MOST, IT IS ALSO A HAZARD TO ONES LIFE. MITSUBISHI SHOULD RECALL ALL VEHICLES WHICH CONTAIN THE F4A51 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TO PERFORM THE WAVE SPRING AND FILTER UPDATE OR REIMBURSE THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD IT DONE AT THEIR COST.

WHEN I PURCHASED THIS CAR IT HAD A MINOR CRACK IN THE DASH BOARD.  IT WAS ABOUT 1 INCH LONG.  WEEKS LATER, IT GREW.  ALSO OTHER CRACKS STARTED TO APPEAR.  WHILE IN THE GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT, I PARKED NEXT TO ANOTHER SPYDER AND NOTICED IT'S DASH WAS CRACKED IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATIONS.  AFTERWARDS, I NOTICED THAT EVERY MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE 2003 AND NEWER HAVE CRACKED DASH BOARDS IN THE SAME LOCATION.  I RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND WEBSITES AND MESSAGE BOARDS WHERE OWNERS OF MITSUBISHI ECLIPSES COMPLAIN ABOUT CRACKING DASHBOARDS.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE LOCAL MITSUBISHI SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THE SERVICE MANGER TOLD ME TO CONTACT MITSUBISHI USA.  HE SAID THIS PROBLEM IS ENDEMIC OF MITSUBISHI ECLIPSES AND SPYDERS DUE TO A DEFECT IN THE MATERIAL THE DASH IS MADE OF AND THE WAY THE DASH BOARD IS MOUNTED TO THE FRAME OF THE CAR.  THERE IS NO AFTER-MARKET SOLUTION.  A NEW DASHBOARD (INSTALLATION AND PARTS) AT A DISCOUNT IS OVER $1,000.  MITSUBISHI USA WILL NOT HELP ME.  THEY SAY THIS IS BECAUSE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I AM NOT SEEKING WARRANTY WORK.  OTHER VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS MAKE \"DASH CAPS\" - MOLDED ABS PLASTIC COVERS TO FIX THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  NO SUCH PRODUCT IS MADE FOR THIS VEHICLE.  FURTHER, MITSUBISHI USA WANTS ME TO PAY $1000.00 FOR THE SAME DEFECTIVE PART THAT WILL CRACK THE SAME WAY.  MITSUBISHI SAYS THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THIS IS NOT A \"DEFECT\".  THE ALSO STATE THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS ISSUE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY CAR, BUT THE DASH BOARD IS FALLING APART.  THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AND UNSAFE.  BECAUSE MY CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE, IF WATER GETS INTO THE DASH BOARD, MY ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS COULD SHORT OUT (INCLUDING MY AIRBAGS, HORN, LIGHTS, ETC.)  PLEASE HELP!   *JB",

THERE IS A LATCH BY THE FRONT SEAT TO OPEN THE TRUNK.  EVER SINCE I  HAD THE CAR, THE TRUNK NEVER OPENS ON THE FIRST TRY.  USUALLY I HAVE TO PULL THE LATCH TWICE.  REASON BEING IS  THE TRUNK IS SO HEAVY WITH THE SPOILER ON IT, IT DOESN'T WANT TO POP UP.  THERE IS NO HANDLE OR ANY WAY TO OPEN THE TRUNK WHAT SO EVER.  SO A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AS MY FRIEND WAS LIFTING UP ON THE TRUNK WITH THE SPOILER, THE SPOILER LITERALLY CAME OFF!!!  THERE IS NO REASON WHY ON A BRAND NEW CAR THE SPOILER SHOULD JUST COME OFF.  SO I TOOK MY CAR TO THE MITSUBISHI DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THEY SAID THAT I USED EXCESSIVE FORCE.  IN ORDER TO PULL A SPOILER OFF YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE WOULD LITERALLY HAVE TO STAND ON THE BUMPER AND YANK FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES.  BUT MY FRIEND SIMPLY LIFTED UP ON IT AND IT CAME OFF (CONSIDERING THERE IS NO WHERE ELSE TO LIFT UP ON THE TRUNK).  AFTER MY UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT THE MITSUBISHI DEALERSHIP I PHONED MITSUBISHI TO FILE A COMPLIANT.  AFTER SPEAKING TO TWO PEOPLE, THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER AND PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE I SHOULD NOT USE THE SPOILER AS A HANDLE.  MY FRIEND BARELY EVEN USED ANY FORCE!  SINCE THE SPOILER HAD TO BE COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF TO DRIVE IT, NOW THE TRUNK JUST POPS UP WHEN THE LATCH IS PULLED IN THE FRONT BY THE SEAT.  THAT JUST SHOWS THAT THE REASON WHY IT DOESN'T POP UP WITH THE SPOILER IS BECAUSE IT'S TOO HEAVY!  MY COMPLIANT IS NOW I HAVE TO PAY $430.00 FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND ISN'T BECAUSE THEY SAID EXCESSIVE FORCE WAS USED.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  MITSUBISHI IS NOT ABOUT MAKING IT RIGHT.  IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THERE IS NO REASON OR EXCUSE FOR A SPOILER COMING OFF THAT EASY ON A BRAND NEW CAR.  THAT'S BASICALLY TELLING ME THAT A) IT A PIECE OF JUNK OR B) IT WAS NOT ASSEMBLED RIGHT.  I HOPE IT'S B AND NOT A.*JB",
