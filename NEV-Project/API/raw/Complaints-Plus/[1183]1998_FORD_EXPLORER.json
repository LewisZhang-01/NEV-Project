MY ARGUMENT IS THAT FORDS RECALL REMEDY DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS A DEFECTIVE RECLINING BRACKET THAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM NOT THE UPPER BOLT THEY REPLACED. I HAVE WORKED AS AN AIRCRAFT MECHANIC AND KNOW A STRESS CRACK WHEN I SEE IT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A FACTORY DEFECT AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY. I HAD ROUGHLY A  INCH LEFT BEFORE THE BACK OF THE SEAT WOULD SNAP AND RECLINE TOTALLY. DEPENDING ON THE SPEED AND TERRAIN YOU ARE DRIVING ON THIS COULD BE TRAGIC.

I HAD TO PUSH WITH ALL MY FORCE AND PULL UP ON THE INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE AT THE SAME TIME. FINALLY IT CAME OPEN BUT THE DOOR HANDLE BROKE. NOW IT WAS TO THE POINT OF DISGUST. DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX IT SO WE WAITED UNTIL WE DID. IN 2008, I TOOK MY EXPLORER TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP. I WAS QUOTED $197 FOR EVERYTHING, INSTALLATION, PARTS, AND LABOR. BUT WHEN I CAME TO PAY THE BILL I WAS INFORMED IT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT $100 IF NOT MORE WHEN COMPLETED. SO MY AUNTS BOYFRIEND, WHO DOES AUTO BODY WORK, FIXED IT. IT WAS WORKING FINE, WE STILL HAD TO JIGGLE TO LOCK FROM THE OUTSIDE TO GET THE LOCKS TO UNLOCK. AND THEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO, I WAS GETTING OUT AND THE DOOR HANDLE BROKE AGAIN. THIS TIME THE HANDLE IS STUCK. I NOW HAVE TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW AND OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE OR CRAWL ACROSS THE PASSENGER SIDE. WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST AND IT IS EMBARRASSING. SO NOW I'VE E-MAILED FORD ABOUT MY COMPLAINT AND THAT IS WHERE I WAS INFORMED YOU DONE THE RECALLS. I REALLY LEARNED THAT THERE IS ALOT OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME COMPLAINT, WWW.CARCOMPLAINT.COM. I REALLY HOPE YOU CAN HELP RESOLVE THIS MATTER. WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT? I GUESS JUST BE OUT $200 MORE WHEN I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP....HOPE YOU CAN HELP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. *TR",

THE FIRE ACCORDING TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LOOKS LIKE IT STARTED AROUND THE BRAKES MASTER CYLINDER UNDER THE HOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER AND ACCORDING TO THE BURN MARKS ON THE HOOD LOOKS LIKE IT WAS THERE WHERE IT BURNED THE HOTTEST, THE WHOLE ENGINE COMPARTMENT BURNED AND LUCKILY THE FIRE DPTM IS REAL CLOSE SO IT DIDN'T BURN COMPLETELY.  UPON INVESTIGATION ON THE INTERNET I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT A SAFETY RECALL FOR THESE VEHICLES INVOLVING THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH THAT IS LOCATED BY THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER AND THAT CAN RESULT ON FIRE, SO I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS RECALL THAT I HAD NO IDEA OF.

WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I ACCELERATED AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE VEHICLE TO THE LEFT TO FOLLOW THE ROAD.  TO MY SHOCK AND HORROR THE STEERING WHEEL SPUN FREELY WITHOUT CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF MY VEHICLE.  I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO STEERING WITH  BARELY ANY RESISTANCE ON THE STEERING WHEEL ITSELF.  MY VEHICLE WENT STRAIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD; I STOPPED THE VEHICLE UP ON A SIDEWALK JUST BEFORE A BUILDING.  THANK GOD THERE WAS NO ONE WALKING THERE AT THAT EARLY HOUR.  AFTER I MANAGED TO COMPOSE MYSELF I TRIED TURNING THE WHEEL AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO SPIN FREELY EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT, WITH NOTHING STOPPING IT. IF I TURNED THE WHEEL HARD AND LET GO THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD SPIN COMPLETELY AROUND 5 OR 6 TIMES BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  I CALLED THE UNION CITY POLICE AND TOLD THEM WHAT OCCURRED AND THAT THE CAR WAS UP ON A SIDEWALK WITH NO WAY TO STEER IT.  THEY TOLD ME TO CALL AAA AND SENT A CAR BY.  AAA CAME WITH A FLAT BED AND AFTER A LONG TIME MANAGED TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE CURB AND ON THE TRUCK.  THE DRIVER HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO STEER THE VEHICLE.  I ACCOMPANIED MY VEHICLE AS IT WAS TOWED TO MY LOCAL REPAIR STATION 30 MILES AWAY.  THE STATION FOUND THAT INSIDE THE DRIVERS COMPARTMENT THE STEERING COLUMN IS TWO SEPARATE SHAFTS THAT ARE HELD TOGETHER BY A SINGLE BOLT ( NO NUT ).  THE BOLT HAD BACKED OUT OF THE CONNECTION AND THE SHAFTS HAD BECOME SEPARATED.  THE MECHANIC FOUND THE BOLT UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT ONCE THE SHAFTS BECAME SEPARATED THERE WAS NO WAY TO STEER THE VEHICLE.  HE EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERN THAT THE BOLT DID NOT HAVE A NUT OR SOME KIND OF PIN TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING OUT.  THE MECHANIC PUT SOME 'THREAD LOCKER' ON THE BOLT AND PUT IT BACK IN THE STEERING SHAFT, WHICH FIXED THE PROBLEM.   *JB",

THIS WOULD ALSO RESULT IN A VERY COLD INTERIOR. AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET I FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE 1996-1998 FORD EXPLORER AND A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE CLIMATE CONTROL'S AIR BLENDING DOOR BREAKING, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REGULATE HEAT AND COLD. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED UNTIL I COULD DETERMINE IF THIS WAS IN FACT THE ISSUE I WAS HAVING. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PARK THE VEHICLE UNTIL I WAS SURE I HAD NO NEED TO OPERATE THE CLIMATE CONTROL. I WAS INSTRUCTED HOW TO CHECK FOR A BROKEN BLEND DOOR AND INDEED FOUND MINE TO BE BROKEN. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER IN CARSON CITY NEVADA AND WAS TOLD THAT DESPITE THE FREQUENCY OF THIS PROBLEM IT WAS NOT A RECALL ISSUE AND WITHOUT A WARRANTY THE COST FOR REPAIR WAS $1100. I WAS ALSO INFORMED THE BROKEN PARTS WERE BEING REPLACED WITH PARTS CONSTRUCTED OF IMPROVED  MATERIAL (NYLON) BECAUSE OF THEIR TENDENCY TO BREAK USING THE PREVIOUS MATERIAL (ABS PLASTIC).

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SHOWED US THE AREA IN WHICH THE FIRE STARTED WHICH WAS UNDER THE HOOD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE, HOWEVER, DEEMED IT INDETERMINABLE.  I WAS IN SHOCK THAT THIS OCCURRED AS I ONLY HAD ONE PAYMENT LEFT TO PAYOFF THE LOAN.  I RESEARCHED AND FOUND OUT THAT THE SAME VEHICLES THAT WERE BEING RECALLED BY FORD FOR A  FAULTY CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH WAS ALSO USED ON MY 1998, HOWEVER, HAD NOT BEEN RECALLED.  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE THE SAME YEAR AS MINE WERE CATCHING ON FIRE FOR NO APPARENT REASON WITHOUT WARNING.   THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS, HOWEVER, NOT ON MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE.  FORD SENT ME A FORM LETTER THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO MY HUSBAND WITH OUR ADDRESS, HOWEVER, THE LETTER STATES DEAR MS. X.   (A TRUE INDICATION OF THEIR CONCERN FOR MY ISSUE)  I AM ANGERED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY VEHICLES THAT HAVE BURST INTO FLAMES WITHOUT WARNING, BURNED DOWN CARS AND HOMES AND LIVES LOST AND FORD BELIEVES THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY.  COULD THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A CONSUMER ALERT FOR ALL VEHICLES AND AT LEAST AFFORDED THE CONSUMER THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION TO PAY $20 TO REPLACE THIS PART?  I WILL BE PAYING TO HAVE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION DONE TO PROVE TO FORD THAT THEY ARE IN FACT RESPONSIBLE AND WILL TAKE THIS AS FAR AS I HAVE TO.

ON THE MORNING OF 09 FEB, 2006 THE ACCELERATOR WAS BRIEFLY DEPRESSED TO THE FLOOR WHILE NAVIGATING IN FREEWAY TRAFFIC.  THE ACCELERATOR REMAINED IN THIS POSITION AFTER HAVING REMOVED THE DRIVER'S FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR.  FULL PRESSURE WAS BEING APPLIED TO THE BRAKES WITH NO APPARENT SLOWING OF THE VEHICLE.

UPON INVESTIGATION, IT APPEARS THAT THE BODY OF THE HOSE CLAMP THAT SECURES THE AIR INTAKE HOSE TO THE THROTTLE BODY WAS INTERFERING WITH THE THROTTLE MECHANISM SUCH THAT WHEN THE ACCELERATOR WAS FULLY DEPRESSED, A PLASTIC TAB ON THE THROTTLE MECHANISM WOULD  RUB AGAINST THE BODY OF THE HOSE CLAMP WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO HOLD THE THROTTLE IN THE FULLY OPEN POSITION.

AFTER ARRIVING HOME I PARKED THE FORD 1998 EXPLORER SPORT IN MY DRIVEWAY, APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET FROM THE GARAGE DOOR, AND APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET FROM THE ENTRANCE TO MY HOUSE.  THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, SHUT OFF AND SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY WITH NO PROBLEMS. DURING THE NEXT HOUR, I BEGIN TO HANG CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS ON MY FRONT DOOR, AND I WAS IN & OUT OF THE HOUSE. THE 1998 FORD EXPLORER SPORT WAS STILL FINE IN THE DRIVEWAY. APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR AFTER I FINISHED MY DECORATING, I BEGAN TO SMELL SOMETHING LIKE RUBBER BURNING. I CHECKED MY STOVE, AND ELECTRICAL OUTLETS, AND EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE FINE. I FIGURE THE BURNING SMELL WAS COMING FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. THEY HAD WORKERS THERE DRILLING AND MAKING REPAIRS. SO I THEN CONTINUE TO DO MY CHORES. APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES LATER I WENT TO LOOK OUT MY FRONT DOOR, AND I SAW DARK SMOKE POURING OUT THE HOOD OF THE 1998 FORD EXPLORER SPORT. I PANICKED, CLOSED THE DOOR, GRABBED THE PHONE, RAN OUT TO THE BACKYARD, AND CALL 911. I WAS TO AFRAID TO GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR, AND ALSO AFRAID TO STAY IN THE HOUSE, THINKING THE HOUSE AND GARAGE WOULD ALSO CATCH FIRE.

I CALLED FORD TO SEE ABOUT SOME SORT OF GOODWILL WARRANTY AND OF COURSE ANYTHING WITH GOODWILL IN THE EQUATION IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING FORD WILL NOT DO.  I CURRENTLY HAVE 2 YEARS LEFT ON THE LOAN FOR A PIECE OF CRAP CAR THAT ISN'T EVEN WORTH HALF OF WHAT I STILL OWE ON IT.  I AM REALLY THINKING OF TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND PARKING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ENTRY WAY AND TAKING THE KEYS WITH ME AND TELLING THEM TO STICK IT UP THEIR REARS.  FORD MAKES THE WHOLE CAR INDUSTRY LOOK REALLY BAD AND IN NO WAY WOULD I EVER BUY ANOTHER FORD.    PLEASE HELP US CONSUMERS OUT AND MAKE THE GAME FAIR BETWEEN THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND CONSUMERS...WE ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE THEY KEEP GETTING RICHER AND RICHER.   *LA",

ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2000, I WENT TO A FIRESTONE DEALER IN WYCOFF, NJ, THEY PUT MY NAME ON A LIST AND SAID THEY WOULD CALL ME WHEN REPLACEMENT TIRES COME IN.

I MAINTAINED DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AND ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MODERATE BRAKING.  THE BRAKE PEDAL REMAINED FIRM, BUT I GOT NO BRAKE EFFECTIVNESS  (NOT REDUCED BRAKEING -- ZERO BRAKES!)  SO I STEPPED HARDER ON THE BRAKES AND STILL THERE WAS NO DECELERATION -- NO BRAKES AT ALL, IN FACT, BECAUSE WE WERE GOING DOWN HILL, I CANNOT EVEN BE CERTIAN THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCHED OFF.  ASSUMING THAT THE LACK OF BRAKES HAD TO BE RELATED TO THE ABS MALFUNCTIONING, I TOOK ALL PRESSURE OFF  THE BRAKE PEDAL AND SWITCHED OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH, THEN I REAPPLIED GENTLE PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES AND THE BRAKES WORKED NORMALLY.  TO RECAP:  AFTER THE TIRE BLEW, I HAD NO BRAKES WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING, AFTER SWITCHING OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH THE BRAKES WORKED NORMALLY.  I ESTIMATE THAT 3 TO 5 SECONDS ELAPSED FROM WHEN THE BLOW OUT OCCURED TO WHEN I SWITCHED OFF THE IGNITION.

I HAVE WATCHED THE TIRE HEARINGS ON T.V. AND HAVE RECEIVED THE \"ALLS O.K. WITH YOUR TIRES\" LETTER FROM FORD. BUT, ITS MY LIFE THAT RIDES ON MY TIRES.  IF YOU WOULD CARE TO INSPECT MY TIRES I WILL BE GLAD TO SURRENDER THEM TO YOUR AGENCY IN ORDER THAT YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF A DEFECTIVE FIRESTONE P255/70R16 WILDERNESS TIRE. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME.( DOT NUMBER: W2 TIRE SIZE: P255/70R16 )",

FORD'S CONTRACT WITH FIRESTONE REQUIRED FIVE TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE, TREAD DESIGN, LOAD CAPACITY, ETC TO BE INSTALLED ON MY 1998 FORD EXPLORER 4 WHEEL DRIVE. THAT WAS DONE TO ASSURE THAT WHEN SPARE TIRES WERE USED EITHER IN A FIVE TIRE ROTATION OR AS AN EMERGENCY TIRE, THEY WOULD ALL BE OF THE SAME TREAD DESIGN, ETC SO THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD PERFORM SAFELY. FOUR OF MY FIRESTONE TIRES WERE SUBJECT TO THE RECALL,BUT NOT THE SPARE. I REPLACED THE FOUR ON THE GROUND WITH BIG \"O\" BRAND TIRES MEETING FORD'S SPECS, AND THE SPARE AS WELL IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FORD;S SPECIFICATIONS. FIRESTONE HAS REIMBURSED ME $400.00 FOR THE FOUR RECALLED TIRES, BUT REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE SPARE WHICH I CANNOT SAFELY USE ON MY VEHICLE.  SINCE I EXERCISED MY OPTION OFFERED BY FIRESTONE TO USE ANOTHER MANUFACTURERS TIRES, WHICH DO NOT MATCH FIRESTONE'S TREAD DESIGN, YOU NEED TO ORDER FIRESTONE TO REPLACE THE SPARE TIRE AT THE SAME REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL OFFERED FOR THE RECALLED TIRES. DOING SO WILL BRING ME AND OTHERS INTO CONFORMITY WITH FORD'S SAFETY HANDLING CONCERNS FOR THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE TO HAVE TIRES OF THE SAME TREAD DESIGN ON THE ROAD DURING FIVE TIRE ROTATION OR DURING EMERGENCY NEEDS.

MY 1998 FORD EXPLORER ([XXX]) CAME EQUIPPED WITH THE WILDERNESSAT TIRES.  DURING THE FALL OF 1998, I EXPERIENCED 4 TIRE REPAIRS AND IN THE EARLY PART OF 1999, 2 MORE TIRE REPAIRS AND TWO FAILURES (NOTE: FOUR TRIPS TO ARIZONA, FROM COLORADO, HAD OCCURRED).  THE TWO FAILURES OCCURRED LATER DURING TRAVEL IN 1999, ONE ON I-40 OUTSIDE ALBUQUERQUE, NM (ENROUTE TO AZ AT APPROX 62 MPH, A SEPARATION AT THE SIDEWALL/TREAD AREA) AND THE OTHER IN PHOENIX, AZ FOUND AS A LEAKING TIRE BUT IDENTIFIED, UPON BREAKDOWN, AS A NON-REPAIRABLE SIDEWALL/THREAD SEPARATION AT THE THREAD LINE).  EACH FAILURE WAS REPLACED WITH FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES.  HOWEVER, I LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRESTONE TIRES AND ON MAY 6 1999 I REPLACED THE FOUR INSTALLED TIRES WITH MICHELIN LTX (MS) TIRES, RETAINING THE SPARE AS AN ORIGINAL FIRESTONE. *AK( DOT NUMBER: UNKNOWN TIRE SIZE: 235/75R/15 )    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

FIRESTONE REFUSED TO REPLACE THEM BECAUSE THE DOT CODE WAS VNHL INDICATING THAT THEY WERE MADE IN QUEBEC.  OUR FORD DEALER, JIM ROSS, TOLD US TO GO ANYWHERE AND BUY ANY TIRES, AND THAT FORD OF FIRESTONE WOULD REIMBURSE US.  HE SAID THEY WERE SCAREY LOOKING.  HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY WIFE, LUANNE, DRIVING ON THEM.  LUANNE BOUGHT 4 NEW MICHELINS AND HAD THEM PUT ON FOR $507.32.  SINCE THE DAMAGED FIRESTONES WERE NOT MADE IN DECATUR, IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL NOT GET OUR MONEY BACK.  WE ARE UPSET ABOUT LOSING THIS MUCH MONEY, BUT MY FAMILY'S SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN $500.  I HOPE YOUR OFFICE CAN LOOK INTO THIS PROBABLE PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES THAT SO FAR HAVE ESCAPED THE RECALL, BEFORE MORE LIVES ARE LOST AND PROPERTY DAMAGED.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

I ALSO BROUGHT MY VEHICHLE INTO FORD AND THEY SAID THEY CAN DO NOTHING AS THEYDID NOT MAKE THE TIRE.  THE MECHANIC DID AGREE HOWEVER, THE TIRE IS DEFECTIVE. I ALSO BROUGHT MY VEHICLE INTO A GOODYEAR STORE, AND THEY TOO ADVISED ME THAT THE 3 TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE AND THE TREADS ARE SEPERATING FROM SIDEWALL. I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO REPLACE 4 TIRES, MUCH LESS 5 AND I KNOW FOR A FACT MY FIRESTONE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE, EVEN IF THEY WHERE NOT MADE IN THE ILLINOIS PLANT. I AM NOT GETTING HELP FROM EITHER FORD OR FIRESTONE, BOTH REFUSE TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.  I WOULD HOPE SOMEONE WILL BE ABLE TO CONACT ME AND TELL ME HOW TO PROCEED. I HAVE A FAMILY OF 5 AND DO NOT WANT TO RISK THEIR LIVES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ....STACEY O'CONNELL( DOT NUMBER:   )",

FORTUNATELY, I WAS ON A LEVEL AND STRAIGHT STRETCH OF ROAD WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURED.  HAD THE INCIDENT OCCURED 5 MILES EARLIER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND MAY NOT HAVE SURVIVED TO FILE THIS REPORT.  I TURNED THE TIRE IN TO FIRESTONE THAT DAY AND WAS PROVIDED A REPLACEMENT.  I PURCHASED A MATCHED 2ND FOR THE OTHER SIDE.  WITH THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY AND RECALL, I CHOSE TO REPLACE MY TIRES WITH THOSE OF A DIFFERENT AND STILL REPUTABLE MANUFACTURER.  I NOW HAVE 5 PIRELLI SCORPIONS OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT.  I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED FIRESTONE'S DISTRICT OFFICE IN THIS AREA.  I WAS TOLD TO BRING MY ORIGINAL WILDERNESS TIRES TO MY LOCAL DEALER AND SUBMIT THE REIMBURSEMENT FORMS.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO GAURANTEE THAT I WILL BE REIMBURSED, I INFORMED THE LOCAL OFFICE THAT THE DISTRICT OFFICE ASKED THAT THEY MAY WISH TO STUDY THESE TIRES.  WHEN I TOLD THE LOCAL STORE STAFF OF THE REGIONAL OFFICE'S DIRECTIVE TO ME, THE MECHANIC INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKELY DESTROY THE TIRES SINCE THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE CURRENT RECALL.  I ASKED THE STORE MANAGER STEVE TO CHECK WITH THE DISTRICT OFFICE FIRST.

I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES OF BOTH COMPANIES (FIRESTONE AND FORD) BUT WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO UNTIL THE TIRE WAS RECALLED.  AT THIS TIME ONLY THE WILDERNESS AT WITH A DOT OF VDHL HAS BEEN RECALLED, NOT THE VNHL WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE (EVEN THOUGH THE ATX TIRES FROM THE SAME CANADIAN PLANT HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  THE TIRES ARE MAKING A LOUD ROARING AND BUMPING SOUND AND I HAVE A WRITTEN REPORT FROM THE FORD SERVICE DEALER WHERE THEY INSPECTED THE TIRES AND SAW THE SEPERATION LINES ON ALL TIRES (BUT I AM TOLD THEY CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL IT IS RECALLED, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE A VERY IMIDIATE DANGER TO DRIVE.)  I ASKED DOUG SMITH THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THEY WERE REPORTING THE DAMAGE TO THE DOT CODE VNHL TIRES AS THEY WERE INSPECTED AND VISUALLY OBSERVED AND HE STATED THEY WERE NOT.  HE STATED THEY ONLY REPORTED WHETHER THE TIRES INSPECTED WERE ONES ON THE RECALL OR NOT.  PLEASE HELP, THESE TIRES ARE DANGEROUS BUT NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.( DOT NUMBER: VNHL TIRE SIZE: P235/75R15 )",

I WAS TRAVELING EAST ON HIGHWAY 190 IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE AT 60 MPH, WHEN A CAR PULLED IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK I WAS FOLLOWING.  THE TRUCK BRAKED CAUSING ME TO BRAKE.  UPON  BRAKING, BOTH TIRES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE VEHICLE EXPLODED CAUSING ME TO GO INTO A TAIL SPIN. I DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD WITHOUT HITTING ANYONE ELSE.  FORTUNATELY, I DID NOT HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE OR HURT ANYONE ELSE.  MY VEHICLE ENDED UP ROLLING OVER FOUR TIMES AND ENDED UP FACING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON THE MEDIAN.  ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY TOTALED, I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE SUFFERED LIFE THREATENING INJURIES.  THE POLICE, PARAMEDICS, AND FIREMEN ARRIVING ON THE SCENE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS ALIVE.  THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE CUT TO GET ME OUT.   THERE WERE WITNESSES TO THIS ACCIDENT WHO PROVIDED STATEMENTS TO THE POLICE.  THERE WAS NO CITATION ISSUED.  MY RIGHT HAND WAS BADLY CUT, I HAD SEVERED AN ARTERY AND MUSCLE, AND RECEIVED 12 STITCHES.  MY LEFT EAR WAS CUT AND HAD TO BE STITCHED.   THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY, TO INCLUDE MY HEAD, WAS BADLY BRUISED.   THIS ACCIDENT HAS HAD A SERIOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT ON ME.  IT TOOK TWO WEEKS FOR ME TO BEGIN DRIVING AGAIN.  USAA, MY INSURANCE COMPANY, INFORMED US, AS A RESULT OF THEIR INVESTIGATION, THAT THEY HAD FLAGGED MY VEHICLE BECAUSE THE TIRES WERE THE FIRESTONE TIRES BEING RECALLED AND WERE FOUND AT FAULT FOR CAUSING MY ACCIDENT.

AS I APPROACHED POWAY THE FRONT END STARTED TO MAKE A THUMPING NOISE.  I WAS LESS THAN 1 MILE FROM MY SISTER'S HOUSE, SO I LOWERED MY SPEED AGAIN AND FINISHED MY TRIP.  WE LOOKED AT THE TIRES AND NOTICED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE HAD A BULGE IN IT.  IT WAS ABOUT  5\" IN SIZE ALONG THE TIRE TREAD.  ON 7/17 I TOOK MY EXPLORER TO THE FORD DEALER OF POWAY (PERRY FORD) FOR AN INSPECTION.  ROBERT SAW THE BUBBLE AND SAID THAT ALL FOUR TIRES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  HE SUGGESTED A NEW SET OF FIRESTONES.  HAVING HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEM ON OUR 1993 RANGER, AND SEEING THE BUBBLE ON A TIRE THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED I REFUSED.  HE WAS VERY PERSISTANT SAYING FIRESTONE MAKES A GREAT TIRE, BUT I REFUSSED.   HAVING ALL FOUR TIRES REPLACED,  MOUNTED, BALANCED, AND AN ALIGNMENT, IT COST $550.21 TO GET MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN HOME TO ANAHEIM.  WHEN WE BOUGHT THE EXPLORER IN 1998, WE ASKED FOR THE TIRES AT THAT TIME, BEFORE PICK-UP, TO BE REPLACED AS WE HAD HAD PROBLEMS WITH FIRESTONES ON THE RANGER.  THE DEALER WOULD NOT REPLACE THEM, BUT GAVE US THE NAME OF A PLACE TO GO TO GET NEW TIRES AND POSSIBLY AT A DISCOUNT AS THE FIRESTONE TIRES WERE NEW AND COULD BE BOUGHT BACK.  IF THIS CONDITION HAS BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR AWHILE, WHY WOULD THE FORD DEALER OF POWAY SUGGEST(ALMOST INSIST) THAT THE SAME TIRE BE PUT BACK ON??  ISN'T THAT A LITTLE NEGLECTFUL OF ROBERT AND THE DEALER KNOWING I WAS GOING TO GET BACK ON THE FREEWAY WITH MY CHILDREN AND DRIVE OVER 80 MILES?  I AM VERY ANGRY AND UPSET ABOUT HEARING ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION GOING ON AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING WAS SAID TO ME, AND IT COST ME $550.00 FOR A PROBLEM THAT THEY CREATED.

AFTER ROUTINE SERVICE AND (SECOND) TIRE ROTATION/BALANCE AT 12,000 MILES, I NOTICED MY VEHICLE \"PULLING\" TO THE RIGHT WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY.  I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE SERVICING DEALER (KEARNY MESA FORD, SAN DIEGO CA), AND ASKED THEM TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, THEY WERE UNABLE TO ROTATE THE TIRES AND STILL HAVE THEM BALANCED WITHIN SPECIFICATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE TIRES WERE RETURNED TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS ON THE VEHICLE.  THE EXPLANATION GIVEN TO ME WAS THAT THERE WAS \"LIKELY A LOOSE BELT WITHIN ONE OF THE TIRES PREVENTING IT FROM BALANCING CORRECTLY, BUT SINCE THE VEHICLE DIDN'T SEEM TO \"PULL\" WHEN THIS TIRE WAS MOUNTED ON THE REAR, I SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT THERE AND NOT ROTATE MY TIRES IN THE FUTURE.\"  WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT WARRANTY AND/OR REPLACEMENT, I WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE TIRES HAD 12,000 MILES ACCRUED, THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.  AS A RESULT OF NOT ROTATING MY TIRES (...SOMETHING I NORMALLY DO AS SCHEDULED), MY TIRES HAVE WORN IRREGULARLY AND I BELIEVE HAVE WORN OUT PREMATURELY (...IN THIS CASE, APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES; HOWEVER I GENERALLY GET MUCH GREATER TIRE LIFE DUE TO THE \"HIGHWAY\" DRIVING I DO AND PROPER TIRE MAINTENANCE).

THE FIRESTONE DEALER IN S. A. ADVISED THAT YOU COULD NOT TELL BY LOOKING AT THE TIRE ON THE VEHICLE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  I PAID AN ADJUSTED PRICE FOR THAT TIRE AND JUST PURCHASED ANOTHER NEW WILDERNESS TIRE ON 7/28/2000 BOTH OF WHICH WERE MOUNTED ON THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE TWO TIRES ON THE REAR WERE ORIGINALS.   I HEARD A LOUD BANG TO MY LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY FELT THE VEHICLE LURCH INTO THE LEFT LANE.  I BELIEVE THAT ONLY MY POLICE TRAINING IN DRIVING VEHICLES AT HIGH SPEEDS ENABLED ME TO KEEP CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO STEER IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND DUE TO THE TIRE ONLY SEPARATING AND NOT LOSING AIR PRESSURE WAS I ABLE TO LIMP INTO GAINESVILLE, TX TO GLEN POLK FORD.  I WAS TOLD BY THEM THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A VEHICLE WITH SO MUCH DAMAGE FROM A TIRE SEPARATION.  I HAD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER ADJUSTED WILDERNESS TIRE AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY.

THE DRIVER OF THAT VEHICLE WAS LUCKY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOWING A TRAILER WITH A PORSCHE ON IT WHEN THE TIRE SEPARATED AND AN ACCIDENT DID NOT OCCUR.  *AK( DOT NUMBER: V0H11PY527 TIRE SIZE: P235/75R15 )",

I APPLIED THE BRAKES, BUT THE VEHICLE ONLY SLOWED DOWN TO 50-55 MPH.  AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH THE BRAKES APPLIED FOR A FEW MINUTES (SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO), I DECIDED TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF AND THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE TO SHUT OFF.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO GLIDE THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER ROAD ON THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE, OURSELVES OR ANYONE ELSE.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT FROM TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM.  TO MY AMAZEMENT, THE SERVICE DEPT. INDICATED THAT THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND THAT I COULD TAKE IT HOME.  I TOLD THEM I CAN'T ACCEPT HIS RESPONSE AS AN ANSWER FOR ALMOST LOSING MY LIFE, AND THAT I WANT THEM TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF WHY THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN AND UNEXPLAINED ACCELERATION.  SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN-AROUND AND NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THIS MATTER RESOLVED QUICKLY BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE IS PUT IN DANGER WITH THIS VEHICLE, OR OTHER ONES IN THIS CLASS THAT MAY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.
