I HAD TO STAND ON THE PEDAL, SO TO SPEAK, TO GET THE 2005 YUKON TO STOP BEFORE HITTING THE TRAFFIC STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED HOME AND UPON INSPECTION THE BREAK LINE HAD FAILED RIGHT BELOW THE RADIATOR WHERE IT CONNECTS TO A PLASTIC RETAINER CLIP. I WAS AMAZED AT THE FACT WITH ONLY 118,000 MILES I HAD TOTAL RUST THROUGH ON BRAKE LINES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS ON A VEHICLE AND WOULD EXPECT THE LINES TO LAST LONGER. I LIVE IN SOUTHERN INDIANA ABOUT 40 MILES FOR CINCINNATI, OH. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!!  SINCE I REPAIRED THIS FAILURE, THE TRANS LINE AND ANOTHER BRAKE LINE HAVE FAILED DUE TO RUST.!!  I HAVE OWNED GM PRODUCTS MY WHOLE LIFE AND HAD A 1998 YUKON WITH 235,000 MI. ON THE TRUCK AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH RUST THROUGH ON THE LINES. I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING GM WOULD DO TO HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM. I WORRY EVERY TIME I USE THE TRUCK THAT ANOTHER LINE WOULD BREAK AND CAUSE A MASSIVE ACCIDENT.  *TR",

I HAVE ALSO NOT COME ACROSS ANY SORT OF MANUAL FIX, I.E. TURNING OFF THE IGNITION, TAKING THE VEHICLE OUT OF GEAR, BACKING UP, ETC.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MORE THAN 5 TIMES, AND HAS ONLY CEASED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I HAVE REMOVED THE RELAY WHICH CONTROLS THE 4WD SYSTEM.   I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH SHEER BLIND LUCK OR DIVINE INTERVENTION THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN INJURED WHILE OPERATING THIS VEHICLE. LET ME RESTATE: THIS ISSUE OCCURS ENTIRELY AT RANDOM, AND NOT ONLY WHEN JUST STARTING OFF DRIVING. IT OCCURS AT SPEED! WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE VEHICLE LITERALLY CAN GO FROM TRAVELING AT 35 MPH TO LESS THAN 5 MPH. KEEP IN MIND THAT SINCE THE BRAKE IS NOT DEPRESSED, FOLLOWING DRIVERS HAVE NO WARNING OF THIS RAPID DECLINE IN SPEED.

I'VE ALSO HAD THE MISS PLEASURE OF HAVING TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION ($3500) THIS YEAR AS WELL.  SLIPPING AND EVENTUALLY IT WAS GOING TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT SO HAD TO OPEN THE WALLET FOR THAT.    ANOTHER ISSUE (ELECTRICAL) - I SHUT THE CAR OFF WITH THE BLOWER MOTOR ON (HEATER IN THE WINTER) AND THE BLOWER MOTOR STAYED ON EVEN AFTER THE CAR WAS SHUT OFF, NO KEYS.  IT CONTINUED TO RUN AND WOULD HAVE DRAINED THE BATTERY HAD I NOT DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY.  PULLING THE FUSE HAD NO EFFECT.  ($600)    I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE BOTH THE FRONT AIRBAG SENSORS IN THE FRONT BUMPER.  ONE WENT AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE OTHER WENT.  NO IMPACTS, THEY JUST DIED. ($1200 FOR BOTH).    I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR AIR SHOCKS ($2500)    I BOUGHT THIS CAR USED (SUPPOSEDLY GM CERTIFIED)) FROM A CHEVY DEALER NOT MORE THAN 3 YEARS AGO WITH 75K MILES.   I NOW HAVE 99K MILES.

THERE WAS A SMALL HOLE IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD JUST ABOVE WHERE THE FIRE OCCURRED.  THE HEADLINER WAS COMPLETELY CHARRED ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VEHICLE WERE COVERED IN HEAVY SOOT INCLUDING A BRAND NEW TODDLER CAR SEAT, STROLLER, SOFTBALL GEAR BAG, DVD NOTEBOOK FILLED WITH DVD'S AND VARIOUS TOOLS.  AFTER THE FIRE WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE MARYLAND STATE FIRE MARSHALL'S OFFICE THE FIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE ELECTRICAL.  IT NEVER PENETRATED THROUGH THE FIREWALL INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED ITSELF DUE TO LACK OF OXYGEN AND NEVER AFFECTED THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE OTHER THAN THE HOLE LEFT BEHIND IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE WINDSHIELD.  IT WAS RAINING THAT NIGHT, SO IT IS BELIEVED THE RAIN IS WHAT KEPT ENOUGH OXYGEN FROM ENTERING THROUGH THE HOLE.    WE CONTACTED GM AND OUR INSURANCE IMMEDIATELY.  WE DIDN'T HEAR BACK FROM GM UNTIL 3 DAYS AFTER THE OCCURRENCE.  THEY TOOK A REPORT.  WE WERE TOLD THAT \"THE REPORT WOULD BE SENT TO TEXAS AND WE SHOULD HEAR SOMETHING BACK WITHIN 5-10 BUSINESS DAYS.\"  TODAY IS DAY 11 AND THE ONLY THING I HAVE HEARD IS THAT A LETTER HAS BEEN SENT BY MAIL TO US TO SUBMIT TO OUR INSURANCE COMPANY.  THAT LETTER HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED.  HAD THIS VEHICLE BEEN PARKED IN OUR GARAGE THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CATASTROPHIC AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DRY ALLOWING MORE OXYGEN TO ENTER THE VEHICLE.

SO I CHECKED THE OTHER FRONT TIRE AND IT HAD THE SAME TYPE OF WEAR ON IT (INSIDE TREAD).   THE BACK TIRES ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR IN THE SAME MANNER. I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FROM WHICH I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE AND TOLD THEM THAT I FELT THAT THE SECOND SET OF TIRES THAT THE DEALERSHIP PUT ON MY SUV WERE DEFECTIVE ALSO.   THE FIRST SET OF TIRES WERE CHANGED OUT, APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO, BECAUSE OF BEING DEFECTIVE BRIDGESTONE TIRES (THEY WERE STILL UNDER WARRANTY,BUT THE CHANGE WAS NOT NOTED IN MY SERVICE HISTORY REPORT OR ON MY CARFAX REPORT).    ALL OTHER MINOR SERVICE WORK WAS NOTED IN HISTORY/CARFAX REPORTS, SO WHY WASN'T THE CHANGE IN TIRES NOTED ALSO. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD BE IT WAS NORMAL WEAR, OR A PROBLEM WITH THE SHOCKS, BUT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD OVER 36,000 MILES (OUT OF WARRANTY) HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING, TO TAKE THEM TO THE FIRESTONE COMPANY (MANUFACTURER), SO I DID.  THE MAN AT THE FIRESTONE COMPANY SAID THAT IT WAS A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM,  THAT I DIDN'T ROTATE THE TIRES (BUT I DID/ SERVICE HISTORY REPORT).    SO I TOOK MY SUV TO A REPUTABLE TIRE COMPANY. THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT IT WAS THE  TIRES, THEY WERE CUPPING ON THE INSIDE.   MY TIRES ARE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS LE (RAISED WHITE LETTER) TIRES. MY FRONT END WAS CHECKED BY COMPUTER  THEY WERE OFF BY -.2 ON RIGHT & -.1 ON LEFT.   NOT OFF ENOUGH FOR THE TIRES TO WEAR AS THEY DID.  THE SHOCKS ARE NOT BOUNCY.  I CANNOT GET ANY ANSWERS ON THE CAUSE OF MY TIRES WEARING IN THIS MANNER.  I FEEL THAT THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE, BUT NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  IF I AM WRONG I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING SO. *TR",

TRUCK WAS IN THE SHOP ON 1/12/07 FOR REGULAR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, WHICH INCLUDED INSPECTION OF THE RADIATOR, COOLANT SYSTEM AND HOSES. ON 3/6/07, CALLED TO CHECK ON MY TRUCK TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS SLIGHT DAMAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION; HOWEVER, THE ADVISOR STATED \" I WOULD NOT GET THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED RIGHT NOW, JUST BEGIN A SERVICE FOR A NEW VEHICLE\" JUST THE WORDS YOU WANT TO HEAR AFTER WASTING YOUR MONEY ON A LUXURY SUV. I CONTACTED GMC CUSTOMER CARE AND THEY INDICATED THERE ARE NO RECALLS ON THE ISSUE. AFTER DOING AN IN DEPTH ONLINE SEARCH I AM NOW AWARE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. GMC AS WELL AS THE DEALER ACT AS IF IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL SO OWNERS HAVE NOT PRESSED THE ISSUE. MANY OWNERS STATE THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE RUN AROUND SO THEY GET THE CAR REPAIRED AND DON'T PURSUE THE ISSUE. THIS MATTER NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND POSSIBLE RECALLS.

THEY HAVE REPLACED THE FIRST TRANSFER CASE MODULE AND WHEN THE PROBLEM PERSISTED THEY REPLACED THE SECOND TRANSFER CASE MODULE.  I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE STABILITY SYS  BUT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T JUST CHECK IT WITHOUT A RECALL. THE LIGHTS CONTINUED TO COME ON AND MORE PROBLEMS STARTED OCCURRING.  THE 4L AND THE SERVICE 4WD LIGHT AND STABILITY SYS DISABLED LIGHTS WOULD ROTATE FLASHING AND I COULD NOT GET THE 2WD LIGHT TO STAY ON AND ALTHOUGH IT SAID IT WAS IN 4L IT WAS STILL IN 2WD AND IT TRIED TO LOCK UP A FEW TIMES.  THEN THE NEUTRAL RED LIGHT WAS ON AND BOTH WARNING LIGHTS WERE FLASHING BUT WAS STILL DRIVING IN 2WD.  NEXT NONE OF THE 2WD, 4WD OR NEUTRAL LIGHTS WERE ON BUT BOTH WARNINGS WERE FLASHING AND THE (T/C) ICON ON THE DASH WAS DISPLAYED AND I COULDN'T GET THAT TO GO OFF BUT AGAIN WAS STILL DRIVING IN 2WD.  FINALLY, IT WAS LITERALLY LOCKED INTO 4L, WAS MAKING AWFUL GRINDING NOISES, BOTH WARNINGS WERE FLASHING AND (T/C) ICON WERE ALL ON AND I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF 4L NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED.  I WAS STRANDED (IT WAS DARK AND LATE).  I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  NOW THEY HAVE REPLACED THE ENCODER MOTOR BUT I AM STILL VERY CONCERNED THERE IS STILL MORE DAMAGE AND I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT.  IF I HAD BEEN GOING DOWN THE FREEWAY OR AT A HIGHER SPEED, I AM CONFIDENT THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN IN AN AWFUL ACCIDENT AND BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR WORSE YET DEAD!I COMMUTE TO WORK, HAVE CLIENTS WITH ME AND ALWAYS HAVE CHILDREN WITH ME GOING TO SPORTING EVENTS, FIELD TRIP, ETC.  THERE HAS BEEN ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE I PURCHASED IT IN JUNE 2005 AND EACH TIME IT GETS MORE SERIOUS!

ONE CHILLY WINTER MORNING ON MY WAY TO WORK, I HEARD AN EXPLOSIVE SOUND AND REALIZED THAT MY LEFT REAR TIRE HAD BLOWN OUT.  I WAS DRIVING AT HIGH FREEWAY SPEED (75 MPH, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 70) WITH OTHER DRIVERS DRIVING AT THE SAME SPEED WITH NOT ENOUGH CLEARANCE IN FRONT AND BEHIND MY VEHICLE.  I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR.  I STRUGGLED TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHILE I ALSO FEARED OF A REAR-END COLLISION IF I DON'T ACT FAST.  REALIZING I AM IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, I GRIPPED THE STEERING WHEEL FIRMLY, IMMEDIATELY HIT THE BRAKES, AND MADE A SUDDEN SHARP TURN ON THE SHOULDER.  THIS SUDDEN LATERAL SHIFT AND ABRUPT MANEUVER CREATED A FORCE THAT TILTED THE VEHICLE SIDEWAYS (THE TWO RIGHT TIRES - FRONT & REAR - WERE UP ON THE AIR) FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS.  THE SHARP TURN ON THE SHOULDER LED ME TO THE FREEWAY MEDIAN (AN OPEN GRASSLAND WITH UNEVEN PAVEMENT AND SOFT SOIL).  THANKS TO THE SAFETY FEATURE OF MY VEHICLE, THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ESC), AFTER A BRIEF MOMENT I FELT MY TWO RIGHT TIRES WERE BACK ON LEVEL WITH THE GROUND AND THE VEHICLE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ITS POWER ALLOWING ME TO SAFELY STOP THE VEHICLE WITHOUT ROLLING OVER.  AS FOR THE BLOWN OUT TIRE, IT HAS BEEN SPLIT IN HALF.  I TALKED TO GMC ABOUT THIS INCIDENT AND WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED OF A TIRE MANUFACTURER DEFECT/FAILURE.  GMC STATED THEY DON'T MAKE TIRES.  I SHOULD TAKE MY CASE TO GOODYEAR TIRES.  THERE IS MUCH ECONOMIC PHYSICAL DAMAGE THAT RESULTED FROM THIS TIRE BLOW-OUT.  THE LEFT INNER FENDER WELL COVER WAS DAMAGED AND CREATED A HOLE THROUGH THE SHEET METAL.  ALSO A REAR BODY MOLDING WAS MISSING AND DAMAGED TO LEFT RUNNING BOARD END CAP.  THE RIM ON DAMAGED TIRE NEEDS TO BE SPIN-TESTED FOR BALANCE AND OUT OF ROUND ROAD DAMAGE.  THE APPROXIMATE DAMAGES TO THE VEHICLE ARE $4,000 - $5,000.  AND OF COURSE, EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.*JB",

        "summary": "FROM: JAMES WARD  COMMENTS:  I PURCHASED A 2005 GMC YUKON XL DENALI IN DECEMBER OF 2004. AFTER JUST  TWO DAYS OF OWNERSHIP I NOTICED THAT THE CARGO COVER WOULD NOT LOCK  PROPERLY IN THE COVERED POSITION. I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED  THEM TO REPLACE THE CARGO COVER. THEY TRIED SIX COVERS BUT THEY ALL HAD  THE SAME PROBLEM OF FIT. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO INVESTIGATED SEVERAL OTHER  NEW GMC VEHICLES ON THE LOT AND FOUND THE SAME PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP  ORDERED ONE FOR ME BUT IT ALSO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I AND THE  DEALERSHIP HAVE TALKED WITH GMC WHO SAY THAT THAT CANNOT DO ANYTHING  ABOUT IT.  WHY AM I CONTACTING THE NHTSA? ? ? IT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU BELIEVE THAT  THE CARGO COVER IS EXTENDED AND LOCKED IN POSITION IT CAN AND DOES FLIRT  BACK ON DRIVING OR EVEN BEFORE DRIVING. THE REAR SEAT IN THE VEHICLE IS  A GOOD LOCATION TO PLACE CHILDREN AND INFANTS. IF THE CARGO COVER IS  EXTENDED AND IT IS TOUCHED BY A CHILD IN THE REAR SEAT THEN THERE IS A  STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE COVER WILL FLIRT OPEN AND COULD INJURE THE  CHILD. ADDITIONALLY IF YOU EXTEND THE CARGO COVER AND DRIVE, THEN AS THE  CARGO COVERBECOMES UNFASTENED DUE TO THE ILL FITTING NATURE OF THE COVER  IT WILL FLIRT OPEN MAKING A DISTRACTING NOISE. IF THE DRIVER IS STARTLED  BY THIS OR TURNS TO INVESTIGATE THE NOISE I BELIEVE THAT THIS PRESENTS A  SITUATION THAT COULD ENDANGER THE DRIVER AND OR OTHER PEOPLE AND  PROPERTY.  I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH THE GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY AGREE  THAT THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM AND SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT YOU.THE  DEALERSHIP, FULLY COGNISCENT OF THIS ISSUE, CONTINUES TO SELL THE  VEHICLE WITH THE PROBLEM CARGO COVERS AND REFUSES TO TELL POTENTIAL  CUSTOMERS OF THE PROBLEM.  I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND HELP SAVE AT LEAST A  TRAPPED FINGER AND PERHAPS EVEN A LIFE!",

WHEN I SKIDDED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT, I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE LUGS WAS BROKEN OFF. THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF MY WHEEL COMING OFF. I WAS ONLY DRIVING  BETWEEN 10-15MPH. I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE VEHICLE AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. WHEN THE TIRE CAME OFF THE VEHICLE, 2 CARS IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC HAD TO SWIRVE TO MISS IT. WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP (CUTTER DODGE/GMC IN WAIPAHU, HI) THE FINANCE MANAGER TOLD ME TO CALL THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE ON 05 MARCH 2005 AS A DEMO.  I HAVEN'T HAD THE VEHICLE FOR EVEN 3 WEEKS. WHEN I TALKED WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY ON THE PHONE, THEY TOLD ME TO CHECK WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF IT WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE IT WAS A NEW VEHICLE. WHEN I TOWED THE VEHICLE TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD TAKE LIKE AN HOUR TO DO AN ASSESSMENT ON EVERYTHING TO SEE HOW THE PROBLEM OCCURRED.  IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 55MPH, I COULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE!!!  THE SERVICE MANAGER AFTER 2 HOURS SAID THAT I WOULD BE GRANTED A RENTAL CAR FOR THE DAY, AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION. TODAY, 24 MARCH 2005 WHEN I WENT TO THE SERVICE STATION, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF ALL THE DAMAGES THAT WERE CAUSED TO THE ROTOR/BODY/AXEL OR SHAFT.  THEY EXTENDED MY RENTAL UNTIL MONDAY.  AT THIS MOMENT, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE. I PAID OVER $53,000 FOR THIS VEHICLE. I WANT ANOTHER VEHICLE. THEY CAN HAVE THIS VEHICLE BACK AND GET ME ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT!!!!  I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET ANOTHER VEHICLE. EITHER I WILL GO TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, GMC, OR THE LOCAL NEWS.  JUST LIKE I SAID, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IN THIS VEHICLE!!!!!!!*AK",

WHILE DRIVING HOME ON HIGHWAY 101 NORTHBOUND OVER CUESTA GRADE ON THE DECENT OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE GRADE THE HOOD POPPED OPEN, FORTUNATELY THE ADDITIONAL LATCH CAUGHT THE HOOD THUS PREVENTING THE HOOD FROM FLYING BACK AND SMASHING THE WINDSHIELD. THANKFULLY THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC AT THAT MOMENT AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND SECURE THE HOOD.         I DETERMINED THAT THE HOOD RELEASE LEVER LOCATED NEAR THE FLOOR BOARD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DRIVERS AREA HAS VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE AND IS FAR TO EASY TO RELEASE. I HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE RADIO, TAPPING MY LEFT FOOT AROUND AND WITHOUT KNOWING IT I HAD CAUGHT THE HOOD RELEASE WITH MY FOOT AND POPPED THE HOOD OPEN. I FEEL THAT AN AFTER MARKET REPAIR COULD BE MADE BY CREATING A ATTACHABLE FLAP STYLE DOOR THAT WOULD COVER THE RELEASE LATCH UNTIL IT WAS ACTUALLY NEEDED.        I ALLERTED THE RENTAL AGENCY OF THE DEFECT AND ADVISED THEM NOT TO RENT THAT VEHICLE OUT UNTIL A CORRECTION TO THAT DEFECT HAD BEEN COMPLETED. I ASKED THAT THEY PASS THIS INFORMATION ON TO THE COMPANY AND THAT THEY LET GMC KNOW AS WELL.    THANK YOU,  HILY GREENE.  *AK",
