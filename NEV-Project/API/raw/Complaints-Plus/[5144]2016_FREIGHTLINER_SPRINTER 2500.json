        "summary": "The contact owns a 2016 Freightliner Sprinter 2500. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds, the rear wheels would brake independently; as the failure persisted, the ABS warning light would illuminate on the instrument panel. The contact called the dealer; however, they could not grant a soon enough appointment. The contact stated that as he was coming to a stop with his foot on the brake pedal, the vehicle independently accelerated as the contact slammed on the brake pedal. He was then forced to swerve out of the way of the vehicle in front of him as the vehicle continued to accelerate. The ABS fault warning light was then illuminated on the instrument panel as the vehicle returned to normal operation. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 35,000.",
