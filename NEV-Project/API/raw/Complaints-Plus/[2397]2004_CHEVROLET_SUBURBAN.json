        "summary": "I STARTED THE HOMEWARD SEGMENT OF AN 800 MILE TRIP ON JULY 4TH WEEKEND. SPEEDOMETER APPEARS TO BE WORKING CORRECTLY BECAUSE I MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST POLICE RADAR CHECKPOINT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. I EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND ENTERED A 4 LANE HIGHWAY. AFTER DRIVING AN ESTIMATED 50 MILES FOR THE DAY I WAS STOPPED BY THE STATE POLICE. HE SAID THAT HIS RADAR HAD ME GOING 74 IN A 55 SPEED ZONE WHEN ME SPEEDOMETER INDICATED 55 MPH. WHEN THE OFFICER INFORMED ME OF MY SPEED, I LOOKED AT MY SPEEDOMETER AND SAW THE NEEDLE WAS BELOW 0 MPH. THE SCARY PART OF THIS IS THAT I DID NOT REALIZE THAT I WAS GOING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT, PROBABLY BECAUSE I WAS ACCLIMATED TO THE HIGHER INTERSTATE SPEED, MY SPEED ODOMETER INDICATED I WAS TRAVELING THE SPEED LIMIT, AND UP UNTIL THIS TIME I HAD NO INDICATION THAT MY SPEEDOMETER WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I CONTINUED WITH THE TRIP AND USED MY GPS TO KEEP ME AT A SAFE SPEED THE REST OF THE TRIP.        I COMPARED THE SPEEDOMETER MPH WITH THE GPS MPH MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE TRIP. THE SPEED ODOMETER WENT DOWN TO 0 MPH WHEN I WAS DRIVING 65 MPH AFTER DRIVING AN ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL 40 MILES. AFTER DRIVING AN ADDITIONAL 30 MILES THE SPEED ODOMETER WAS INDICATING THE CORRECT SPEED. THE SPEEDOMETER MALFUNCTIONED ABOUT 70% OF THE TRIP. IT WOULD ALTERNATE BETWEEN NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND WORKING CORRECTLY THROUGHOUT THE TRIP.   I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE CHEVY DEALER THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY BACK HOME. THE DEALER SAID THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER MUST BE REPLACED. I AUTHORIZED THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND THE DEFECTIVE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER IS GOING BACK TO BE REFURBISHED.       THIS FAILURE COMPROMISED NOT ONLY MY SAFETY BUT ALSO MY FAMILY'S SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHER DRIVERS. RESEARCHING THE INTERNET, I AM FINDING THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WIDESPREAD.   *TR",

THIS OCCURS WHEN THE FUEL TANK IS AT 1/4 FULL OR LESS. THE TRAILERING FUEL ADVANCE DELIVERS FUEL TO THE ENGINE AND IF NOT NEEDED THEN IT IS RETURNED TO THE TANK AND RECIRCULATION. THE FUEL IS WARM WHEN RETURNED TO THE TANK. THE LONGER THE ENGINE RUNS THE HOTTER THE FUEL BECOMES AND WHEN THE FUEL IN THE TANK BECOMES HOT ENOUGH THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE FUEL TANK THEN SEIZES AND THE ENGINE STALLS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD, PARTICULARLY WHEN TRAILERING IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LOSS OF BRAKES AND STEERING OCCURS.    THE ONLY SOLUTION WHEN THIS OCCURS IS TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IF POSSIBLE, RAISE THE HOOD AND LET THE VEHICLE COOL FOR 15-20 MINUTES AND THEN START AGAIN. OR, FIND THE NEAREST GAS STATION AND FILL THE TANK WITH COOL GASOLINE SO THE FUEL PUMP NO LONGER SEIZES. IN THE CASE OF BREAKING DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THIS IS ANOTHER MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD SINCE THIS PROBLEM OCCURS BOTH GOING UP OR DOWN HILLS AND THERE IS A LOSS OF STEERING AND BRAKES.

ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SEAT IS CALLED \"EASY EXIT\" WHICH HAS THE SEAT TRAVEL ALL THE WAY BACK TO HELP MAKE IT EASIER TO EXIT/ENTER THE VEHICLE WHEN THE IGNITION KEY IS REMOVED.  THE SEAT SEEMS TO HAVE A PROGRAMMING ISSUE (ACCORDING TO MY DEALER) IN WHICH THE SEAT ACTS INCONSISTENT AND CREATES A SIGNIFICANT DRIVING HAZARD.  FOR EXAMPLE:  THE SEAT ONCE OR TWICE PER WEEK WILL MOVE ALL THE WAY FORWARD AND UP ON IT'S TRACK, NOT RESPONDING TO INPUTS ON THE SIDE OF THE SEAT, DOING IT BY ITSELF.  IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD IF IT DID IT AT JUST KEY EXIT/ENTRY, BUT IT DOES IT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION.  THIS REGULARLY OCCURS AND I FEEL THAT IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  I COMPLAINED TO MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER, WHO SAID THERE IS A \"TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN\" ABOUT IT BUT CHEVROLET DOES NOT HAVE A FIX, OTHER THAN TO SWAP OUT THE SEAT MEMORY COMPUTER, WHICH HAS BEEN DONE.  THE SEAT STILL ACTS BY ITSELF.  SINCE I AM 6'2\", MOVING ME ALL THE WAY FORWARD AND UP IS NOT ONLY UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT MAKES IT HAZARDOUS TO DRIVE SINCE I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SEAT TO REACH IT'S POSITION BEFORE I CAN START TO MOVE IT BACK.  THIS HAPPENS WEEKLY.  I FEEL THAT IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO HAVE A MOVING SEAT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, GIVEN THAT IT COMPROMISES THE DRIVING POSITION AND QUITE POSSIBLY COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT CHEVROLET IS INTERESTED IN FIXING THE \"PROGRAMMING ISSUE\" THE MODULE HAS SINCE I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR WELL OVER A YEAR.  WHEN THE SEAT DOES THIS MOVEMENT, IT ALWAYS GOES TO THE SAME SPOT, ALL THE WAY FORWARD, ALL THE WAP UP.  THIS PRESSES MY LEGS AND LOWER ABDOMEN AGAINST THE WHEEL, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO TURN.  IT ALSO PRESSES MY LEGS BACKWARD (AT THE KNEE) WHICH MAKES BREAKING NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.  CLEARLY A FIX SHOULD BE MADE.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY HAVE \"A LOT\" OF THESE COMPLAINTS. *JB",

WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT A PIN BENDS AND THAT THE ONLY FIX IS TO PERIODICALLY BEND THE PIN BACK.  THIS WE FIND TO BE UNACCEPTABLE AS ONE IS NEVER SURE WHEN THE PIN IS BENT \"ENOUGH\" TO ALLOW THE SEAT TO COME UNLATCHED AND THUS ROLL FORWARD WHEN THE CAR BRAKES.  THE SEAT ROLLED FORWARD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHILE OCCUPIED BY BOTH CHILDREN AND MY WIFES GRANDMOTHER.  AS ONE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE SEAT TO STAY LATCHED WE NO LONGER FEEL THE SEAT IS SAFE TO USE (UNCONTOLLED ROLL FORWARD DURING AN ACCIDENT COULD BE VERY HAZARDOUS) AND NO LONGER ALLOW ANYONE TO SIT IN THAT LOCATION.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE KEN DIXON CHEVROLT (DEALER THAT HAS SERVICED THE VEHICLE) THAT \"LATCH DESIGN IS THE PROBLEM,LATCH BENDS IF CONTACT IS MADE WITH IT\" (QUOTE FROM SREVICE HISTORY IN DEALERS COMPUTER).
