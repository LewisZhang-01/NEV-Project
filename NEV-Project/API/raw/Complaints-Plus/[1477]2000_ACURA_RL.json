AS I PROCEEDED TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE, THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR LOCKED UP. THERE WERE NO BRAKES AVAILABLE AND NO POWER STEERING. TO AVOID BACKING INTO ANOTHER CAR I SOMEHOW GOT THE CAR INTO \"PARK\" AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. THIS PROBLEM WAS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ACURA DEALERSHIP. NOTES ON THE INVOICE READ \"BRAKE LIGHT ON DASH CAME ON WHEN BACKING UP, CAR SEEMED TO \"LOCK UP\" 80 CHECK MASTER CYLINDER CAP CONNECIONS. FLUID LEVEL IN SPEC. TEST DROVE, LIGHT NOT COMING ON, NOT 'LOCKING UP'. PARTS 0.00, LABOR 0.00. I WAS SENT HOME  AND THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2000. IN MY ESTIMATION THIS PRESENTS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION. A TELEPHONE CALL WAS MADE TO ME WHEN I INFORMED THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO PUT ME ON A CONFERENCE CALL WITH AN ENGINEER IN CALIFORNIA WHO WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK WITH ME DIRECTLY; APPARENTLY THEY ARE ONLY DIRECTED TO SPEAK WITH THE DEALERSHIP. THEY ASKED ME ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES; I RELAYED THEM. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP ON SEPTEMBER 27. ON SEPTEMBER 28, I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL STATING THEY COULD FIND NO PROBLEM WITH THE CAR. DO WE WAIT UNTIL THE CAR IS IN \"DRIVE\" AND THE BRAKES FAIL BEFORE ANYTHING IS DONE? I AM UNAWARE OF THE IDIOSYNCRACIES OF THE LEMON LAWS; HOWEVER, I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE IN ACURA'S POSITION SHOULD STILL ANOTHER INSTANCE OCCUR. SINCE THE DEALERSHIP CAN FIND NO PROBLEM I SHALL BE BEHIND ITS WHEEL IN HOPES A MORE SERIOUS INCIDENT DOES NOT OCCUR. THANK YOU. *AK",
