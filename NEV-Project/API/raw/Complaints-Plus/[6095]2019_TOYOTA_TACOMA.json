They were new tires on the 2019 Tacoma when I purchased it new from the Toyota Dealership in August 2019.  4 tires on the Tacoma and 1 Spare tire.  I noticed over he life of these 4 Toyo tires they wore rapidly and chunked and lost chunks of rubber in the tread areas.  I always rotated and balanced my Toyo tires as required.  I had yearly  front end alignments done . 2020 and 2021.  I do an air check every 30 days.  There are no mechanical problems with my 2019 Toyota Tacoma.  When these Toyo Open Range A31 Tires were new they started out at 11/32 tread in August 2019.  As previously noted all 4 tires wore rapidly and chunked, rubber loss in thread.  By October 2021at 19,500  all 4 Tires were at 5/32 closer to 4/32 and had Chunking Rubber loss in threads on all 4 tires.  These tires lasted 2 years and 19,500 miles and must now be replaced.  Toyota does not warranty the Toyo Tires and told me to deal with Toyo Tires directly.  Toyo Tire has been challenging to deal with and are only offering 25% off towards a purchase of 4 new Toyo Tires. This in Unacceptable. Its reasonable for a consumer to expect more than 19,500 miles or 2 years from tires.  The Big Picture and Major Concern is Safetey !!  These Toyo Open Range A31 Tires Wore Out and Chunked with Rubber Loss in Thread by the time they were 2 years old and by the time they reached 19,500 miles.   For safety reason I must replace these tires.  I respectfully request that NTSB investigate this serious safety  matter.",

It was been months since this recall was issued and City World Toyota has not rectified the issue. This vehicle has been unsafe to drive since the recall has been issued and I have been pleading with them to resolve it.

WHEN COMING TO AN UNEXPECTED OR URGENT STOP, THE BRAKE PEDAL FEELS LIKE IT CANNOT BE DEPRESSED ANY FURTHER AND INCREASED PRESSURE TO THE PEDAL DOES NOT INCREASE STOPPING POWER. I AM AN ATHLETIC MALE WEIGHING 205  POUNDS (POINT OF REFERENCE FOR YOU ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE I AM ABLE TO APPLY). HAVING OWNED DOZENS OF CARS OVER 35 YEARS, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CLOSEST I CAN DESCRIBE THE ISSUE TO ANY OF MY EXPERIENCES WOULD BE THIS: IT FEELS VERY SIMILAR TO USING A BRAKE ON A VEHICLE THAT HAS POWER BRAKES WHEN THE ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING AND THERE IS A LOSS OF VACUUM TO THE SYSTEM. AT FIRST, THERE IS INITIAL VACUUM ASSIST, BUT AFTER A MOMENT, INCREDIBLE PRESSURE IS NEEDED TO STOP THE VEHICLE. I VIEW THIS AS AN URGENT AND IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO MUCH SO, THAT I WANT TO GET RID OF THE VEHICLE FOR THE SAFETY OF MYSELF AND OTHERS. SINCE THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEALER CAN HELP. I WILL BRING IT TO THEM FOR A CHECK-UP AS A PRECAUTION THOUGH.  I HAVE TRIED TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE IN ABANDONED PARKING LOTS, BUT HAVE YET BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO.

THIS HAS RESULTED IN UNINTENDED VEHICLE MOVEMENT WHEN IT STARTED SURGING AFTER THE TRUCK WAS PUT INTO DRIVE.  THIS HAS HAPPENED WHEN PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY ON COLD MORNINGS OR LEAVING AN APPOINTMENT OR WORK AFTER THE TRUCK HAD SAT & COOLED.  THE RPM SURGE WASN'T AN ISSUE WHILE IT WAS SIMPLY IDLING.  HOWEVER, IT HAS OCCASIONALLY STARTED SURGING AFTER I PLACED THE VEHICLE INTO DRIVE.  I PLACED THE VEHICLE INTO DRIVE, LET OFF THE GAS BUT HAD NOT YET (OR JUST STARTING TO) PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDAL.  THE SURGING WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO LURCH FORWARD SIGNIFICANTLY WHICH IS POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS. IN ONE INSTANCE I HAD DRIVEN MAYBE 100 YARDS AND PULLED UP TO A STOP.  AS I WAS JUST LETTING OFF THE BRAKE TO ENTER TRAFFIC AND NOT YET PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDAL IT STARTED SURGING AND JERKED FORWARD.  I HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES TO PREVENT HITTING OTHER VEHICLES.  THIS LASTED FOR A MINUTE OR SO AND FORCED ME TO STAY ON THE BRAKE AND BLOCK TRAFFIC UNTIL THE SURGING STOPPED. THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK TO MYSELF AND OTHERS DUE TO THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION/VEHICLE MOVEMENT WHEN THE RPM'S SURGED WHILE THE POWERTRAIN WAS ENGAGED.    TOYOTA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE SURGING AND HAS STATED THERE IS NO REPAIR AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER, TOYOTA HAS ALSO TRIED TO TELL ME THAT IT IS OPERATING AS 'NORMAL'.

WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA. AND THE BEST PART I'M PAYING 35,000 $ OVER A 6 YEAR PERIOD FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK. TOYOTA IT SEEMS MAKES NOTHING BUT CLUNKERS",
