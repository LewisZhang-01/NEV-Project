THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ FROM OTHERS PIECES CONTINUE TO FALL OUT AND EXPOSES MECHANICAL PARTS UNDNERNEATH THE DASH. WE HAVE THE EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY BUT HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO TAKE IT TO OUR LOCAL GMC AND I HEAR IT ISN'T COVERED. THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND GMC NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
