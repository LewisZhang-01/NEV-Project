        "summary": "I'm writing to you to relay a serious safety issue that started with the 2021 Explorer ST manufacturing processes. When Ford designed the new Explorer ST, the rear subframe was engineered to allow the rear differential to be attached with four bolts (Attachment-A). This was needed to properly secure the differential in light of the ST motor putting out more horsepower than their other models. My 2020 Explorer ST had the correct subframe with two bolts (Attachment-B.)  At some point during the manufacturing of the 2021 ST models, Ford started using base-model Explorer rear subframes that contained a single bolt (Attachment-C) on the rear portion of the subframe. This was likely done due to the global shortage of parts and materials that most automotive manufacturers encountered. The results were predictable, and many users in Explorer discussion groups have reported the single-bolt shearing off, dropping the differential and damaging the rear suspension components and exhaust (Attachment-D & E.)  This is a glaring safety issue, especially with a performance car, as a failure at speed could result in loss of control of the vehicle. To date, Ford has not responded to my inquiries requesting more information and a resolution. They did recently release a Special Service Message acknowledging that this is an issue (Attachment-F.)  The thread below on explorerst.org outlines the problem in detail. There are dozens of people there and in the Explorer ST groups on Facebook that have encountered this problem, with varying levels of successful resolution and attention from Ford. I'm happy to provide additional links to conversations about this, if needed.  https://www.explorerst.org/threads/rear-end-damage.2602/  I represent a growing group of ST owners who would like Ford to issue a recall, and repair their vehicles before a failure occurs.",

I applied the brakes continually, as the car jumped a curb traveled through a meadow went through a fence and crashed into a tree.  I had the car towed to the dealer so they could analyze what went wrong and they said they couldn't find anything wrong, but they couldn't say as to why the Explorer spontaneously accelerated without brakes.  The carwash had a video surveillance system and the video clearly shows the car accelerating, jumping the curb and eventually going into the forest to hit a tree.  It is a blessing that I was in a remote area with no people around as the only control I had for the vehicle was steering and had there been people around someone would have been injured or killed.  I contacted the Texas DMV Lemon Law department and they couldn't help because I hadn't tried to get the malfunction repaired more than three times.  They did recommend I contact the NHTSA as safety of this vehicle and possibly others of the type represent a major safety hazard.  Is there anything the NHTSA can do to look into this case and first see that this malfunction is fixed on future products and second see that I can be treated fairly by the Dealer and Ford Motor Company?

Knowing that this is a safety concern, I pulled into a parking lot and shut off the vehicle.  I let the vehicle sit for about 30 seconds and restarted the car.  When restarted, the light did not come back on.  Took the vehicle in to have a recall performed and told the service advisor that the light had come on.  They confirmed that there was a \"stored code\" but \"not something that made sense\".  The dealership has had the vehicle for 9 days with no resolution.  They say that a wiring pigtail harness needs replaced but also that there is a fault in the driver's seat airbag.  The replacement airbag is not available due to a backorder (told 3-4 weeks).  I feel that this is a large safety concern as I was told I could pick up the vehicle until the parts become available knowing that there is a fault in the airbag.  The failure occurred with 3410 miles on the odometer.",

The blow-out was caused by body cladding, which came off the right rear door of our 2021 Ford Explorer - apparently attributable to 19+ MPH desert cross winds at highway speeds of 75 MPH. The trim lodged in the right rear wheel well; slicing the tire and cutting a gash from the aluminum rim. We had to get to California for a scheduled closing on our new home and were therefore unable to stay in Amarillo or Albuquerque for the three days required to receive a matching rim and tire, so I had a nearby tire store install a wheel of a different size with an offsetting tire size to approximate the circumference of the stock wheels and tires. Ford has thus far neglected to acknowledge the obvious defect that would allow a body part to blow off the car and has offered no assistance in repairing the car or reimbursing me for the wheel and tire I had to purchase to meet personal legal obligations. I've seen evidence in online forums indicating other incidents of body trim blowing off Ford Explorers at highway speeds. Ford must take responsibility for this defect and reimburse other owners and me for costs incurred to resolve implications of their defective body parts.",
