AFTER \"PUMPING\" UP THE REAR BRAKE I DID GET SOME BRAKE BACK, BUT IT WENT AWAY WITHIN MINUTES. EVERY TIME I RIDE MY BIKE NOW, I HAVE TO CONTINUALLY \"PUMP\" THE BRAKE TO GET THE BRAKE TO PROPERLY FUNCTION. I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEALER ABOUT THIS, AND THEY STATED \"THAT IS JUST THE WAY IT IS... DUCATI KNOWS ABOUT IT, BUT THEY ARE NOT DOING ANY WARRANTY REPAIR, AS IT IS JUST A POOR DESIGN\". ALL THE DUCATI MOTORCYCLE FORUMS ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, BUT DUCATI WILL STILL NOT ISSUE A FIX FOR IT. I GUESS A BUNCH OF FOLKS HAVE TO GET KILLED FIRST.  *TR",
