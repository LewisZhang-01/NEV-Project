Findings from the service team was, faulty Control Module and it was replaced. However, this replacement did not fix the problem.    Further Investigation led to puncture in the Condenser as the cause. I was told the Condenser had to be replaced. I spoke to my service advisor and Supervisor of the service advisor. My question to them was \u201cHow can the condenser get punctured, which is under the hood of the car. My car never met with any accident\u201d?  Per Dealer Supervisor, While driving rocks from the road, can make its way through the front grill and make a hole on the Condenser and this is a known issue.     My concern is, if this is a known problem, why is Audi still sticking to this Design where it can let rocks pass through the front grill to make a dent on the Condenser.  This is causing a huge inconvenience/hardship to customers like me. I had to spend $1,542.62 for the condenser replacement(though I had a Platinum extended warranty) and had to leave my car at the workshop for 11 days. Now that the Condenser is replaced and working fine, the issue does not resolve here, rocks can potentially come through the front grill and can make a dent on the condenser again. This is still an OPEN issue. If that happens again, I will have to go through the same cycle of hardship/hazard/inconvenience.   From inspection standpoint, the punctured condenser should be available with my Dealer. I have not made a claim through insurance, so no inspection is made on this condenser. I am not certain when the rocks would have puncture the condenser and there is no indication when the condenser was punctured. Since I noticed my Air conditioner not working on June 27th,  I believe this incident of condenser puncture could have happened a week before.",

IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER THE REMOTE/KEY IS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE CAR.  WHEN THE CAR IS IDLE, YOU CANNOT UNLOCK THE CAR USING THE REMOTE AND THE TODDLER WILL BE LOCKED INSIDE THE CAR. THIS CASE IS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE CASE OF NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10626358, WHICH WAS REPORTED FOR 2014 AUDI Q7 IN 2014.  I SEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE REPORTING SIMILAR PROBLEM.  BUT THIS CASE POTENTIALLY CAN BE DEADLY FOR THE TODDLER IF THE CAR IS PARKED IN A NON-OPEN SPACE. THE 2014 CASE REPORT MENTIONED THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN THERE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEAR BEFORE 2014.  SO, IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 10 YEAR SINCE THE PROBLEM WAS REPORTED. FORTUNATELY, THE MOTHER WAS INSIDE THE CAR TOGETHER WITH THE TODDLE AND SHE UNLOCKED THE CAR FROM INSIDE.  OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE A TRAGIC DAY FOR US WITH ALMOST 0 DEGREE AND THE SNOW STORM.  AUDI NEED TO DISABLE THE 'LOCK ALL DOOR FROM REAR' FUNCTION.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND AUDI SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO FIX THE PROBLEM.     IN SUMMARY, THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS THAT THE TODDLER CAN LOCK HIMSELF INSIDE THE CAR: 1. THE CAR IS NOT RUNNING.  THE TODDLER CAN LOCK HIMSELF IN THE CAR IF THE PARENTS ACCIDENTLY LEFT THE REMOTE IN THE CAR.  FOR THIS CASE, THE PARENTS CAN UNLOCK THE CAR WITH THE OTHER SET OF REMOTE. 2. THE CAR IS RUNNING. THE TODDLER CAN LOCK HIMSELF IN THE CAR NO MATTER WHERE THE REMOTE IS. BUT IN THIS CASE, THE DOOR CANNOT BE UNLOCKED WITH THE REMOTE. SO, IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE CAR (FOR EXAMPLE, JUST FINISHED BUCKLING UP THE TODDLER), YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO BEFORE THE CAR IS OUT OF GAS.
