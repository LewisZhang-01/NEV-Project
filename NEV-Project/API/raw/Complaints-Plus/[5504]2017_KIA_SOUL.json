Any time a car engine is at risk of dying or seizing, it's a risk.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? The dealer seems to know what the issue is and is jumping through Kia's hoops to try and get something done about it.

Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  The problem first appeared over the Fourth of July weekend of 2021. I was alerted to the fact that there was an issue because the oil light would flicker for just a split second on sharp curves. The car had somewhere in the neighborhood of 60K miles at that point.   From what I'm finding out, many of the 2017 Kia Souls have the same issue with their engines that the Kias that are under recall have. Burning copious amounts of oil, stalling, running rough to the point that it feels like it's going to die at stops.

Both an independent service center and Kia dealer have confirmed connecting rod failure, and the need for a total engine replacement.  The vehicle is still available for inspection at this time.   Fortunately, the issue began when the engine was turned on so the car was not moving at the time of failure, but had it begun on the highway or had a portion of the rod perforated the engine, it could have led to immediate loss of power while in motion and/or leaking oil. There were no warning lamps or messages prior to failure, and the engine had been maintained according to manufacturer guidelines. Periodically prior to this occurrence, the engine did demonstrate temporary reductions in power when accelerating, like it was hesitating to rev up beyond idle speed.  However, the local Kia dealer was unable to diagnose the problem at that time (53,293 miles), and simply said to come back if it got worse, giving me the phone number for Kia Roadside Service.  Although the loss of power was always temporary and infrequent, it could be a bit surprising when making a right turn into moving traffic, or a left turn across traffic because the car did not move into the traffic as fast as usual, which could have led to a collision with oncoming traffic.  Fortunately it never lasted more than a second or two at a time.  These symptoms returned the day prior to engine failure in greater frequency and duration.   This type of failure is highly unusual for a vehicle of this age (4 years old) and mileage (67,000 miles), and Kia has denied warranty coverage, even though engine issues began before expiration of the warranty.",

They said that the oil looked dark and thin. We had checked the oil the day before and it looked yellow to gold in color. We were not shown any evidence that the oil was dark, only the word of the service department. We had the car serviced and then picked it up from the dealership.   10 minutes or so after picking the car up from the dealership, on Colorado Highway 58 heading west, just outside Golden, CO, there was a loud knocking noise and the check engine and oil pressure lights starting blinking. Seconds later, the car lost power, and then stalled. My husband was able to steer it to side of the highway, where we waited more than three hours for roadside assistance from Kia before having to leave the car to get somewhere safe. The outside temperatures were 90 degrees of more and our child, who was with us, is very sensitive to high temperatures.  We are waiting to hear from the dealership (Kia towing somehow managed to cancel the tow order and left the car on the side of the road all night) and do not yet know the exact nature of the engine failure but the car is undriveable. The fact that the engine stalled and died on the highway, traveling at a speed of 55 mph, is incredibly dangerous and put my husband at extreme risk for an accident or the infamous Kia engine fire.

This is a safety hazard, and if something like this doesn't get fixed, it opens lawsuits for Kia. I suggest that this be corrected under warranty or I will seek legal counsel.",

I was told I have to replace or rebuild the engine. Like many I still have a loan payment and the cost of the repair is more than the cost of the note.

        "summary": "My KIA Soul did not have any warning lights on or strange sounds/issues when I began driving on the highway on 6/5/21 with my 12 year old special needs son. A short time after we entered the highway I began to notice a strange knocking sound and it felt like the car was struggling to maintain speed. Within a few seconds I started to smell a \"hot\" smell and immediately pulled over to the side of a two lane highway with a very small shoulder. When I pulled over the knocking became very loud and then all of the warning lights on the dash flashed on and then the car died. We were stranded on the side of the road in the middle of no where while trucks and cars flew by at high rates of speed. It was also incredibly hot and the car was not functioning to be able to roll down windows. I was able to use roadside assistance through my insurance company and it was towed to a local repair shop. I was told that the engine was blown and my engine had \"thrown\" internal parts. They said the engine was completely dead and needed replaced. They also stated that they have seen this issue a lot with Kia Soul's especially 2015-2017 models. In fact the owner said as soon as he heard what the car was he knew it was going to be engine failure. I am very lucky that I was able to pull over to the small shoulder before the car died or I would have been stuck in the middle of the road right after a hill and my car would have been impossible to see stopped by drivers coming over the hill before it would have been hit. This has also caused my special needs son to become extremely panicked in the car and afraid to drive with me. After a quick Google search I was able to find complaint after complaint after complaint about this issue with the 2017 Kia Soul at around 70-80,000 miles which is exactly where I am at. I know owe a great deal of money on a car that is totaled out unless I spend over $6,000 to replace the engine. Money that I do NOT have after losing my job due to Covid.",

I went to partk and noticed that my check engine light popped on but thought nothing of it as my gas cap lock was broken and so I turned off the vehicle. I want to note there was no sounds, and no over heating. That evening I went to leave and the car would not turn over and thought maybe the battery was bad, but was reminded that it was replaced one week prior. So I had it towed in the next day to a mechanic and upon initial inspection he found that the engine had siezed and locked up as well as it would not turn over. I'm pretty good about personally completing oil changes, but was sharing vehicle with my ex partner and was told that the oil came up 2 quarts short upon checking, but was told that should not be enough to make the engine seize. So the mechanic replaced the starter and upon turning over the vehicle the engine began to produce a bad knock and I was told that the engine was needing to be replaced and was going to lock up again if driven. The vehicle is at 70,000 miles so is no longer covered under the factory warranty and the extended warranty may not cover it so I'm at a lose at the moment. I find it really hard to believe that after all the research I've done on this engine problem and seeing all the people with the same situation occurring that a recall has not been issued on this year.",

CONCERNED I TESTED WHILE DRIVING FORWARD LIKE 20 MPH & DOOR OPENS WHEN GRABBING ON HANDLE. MY CONCERN IS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION ONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MANUALLY UNLOCK ANY DOOR BEFORE IT OPENS. I ADDRESSED WITH MY KIA DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THIS IS NORMAL THAT OPENING HANDLE OVERIDES THE LOCK. THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DO WHEN CAR IS PARKED, NOT WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS ENGAGED. I HAVE 2004 SATURN AND MINE DOESNT DO THAT. I UNDERSTAND DOOR/LOCK FEATURES CAN VARY FROM MANUFACTURER TO MANUFACTURER. I CAN SEE A BENEFIT TO THE HANDLE OVERIDE FEATURE THAT PEOPLE COULD BE IN PANIC IN CASE OF FIRE OR OTHER DANGER THAT ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS THE HANDLE AND STAY TRAPPED BECAUSE THEY FORGET ABOUT THE LOCK. THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE IF THIS IS A FEATURE THEY WANT ENABLED OR NOT. KIA HAS TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. I FEEL THIS IS A BIG SAFETY CONCERN SINCE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BARELY GRAB HANDLE AND DOOR RELEASES; DONT NEED TO PULL HANDLE ALL THE WAY.  IF NOTHING ELSE IT SHOULD RELEASE AFTER 5-10 SECONDS OF CONTINUOUS PRESSURE WHILE HANDLE IS IN MAXED OUT OPENING POSITION TO OPEN DOOR WHILE TRANSMISSION IS IN ANY GEAR OTHER THAN PARK.
