IN MARCH OF 2003 A LOCAL GARAGE DIAGNOSED THE ABS RELAY WAS NOT PROVIDING POWER TO THE ABS PUMP. THE RELAY WAS REPLACED - COST $100. DAYS LATER THE SYSTEM FAILED AGAIN. THE PUMP WOULD ONLY OPERATE IF CONNECTED TO DIRECT BATTERY VOLTAGE TO START IT RUNNING.     IN LATE APRIL THE ABS PUMP WAS REPLACED BY ANOTHER LOCAL GARAGE \u0013 COST OVER $500. THE SYSTEM OPERATED ANOTHER 3 WEEKS, AND THEN FAILED AGAIN, COMPLETELY FAILING DURING IN MID-JUNE. THE VAN WAS TOWED TO THE SAME GARAGE. THE TECHNICIAN IDENTIFIED THAT THE ABS RELAY COIL HAD FAILED. THE VAN IS UN-DRIVABLE BECAUSE THE ABS PUMP ALSO SUPPLIES POWER BRAKE PRESSURE.    THE VAN WAS TOWED TO CHRIS LEITH DODGE IN WAKE FOREST, NC ON JULY 3, 2003 AND INSPECTED. ON JULY 11, 2003 THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LET ME KNOW THAT THEY NEEDED THE DISTRICT MANAGER TO MAKE DETERMINATION OF RECALL WARRANTY REPAIR OF THE SYSTEM. JULY 15, 2003, THE SERVICE MANAGER AND DISTRICT MANAGER DETERMINED THAT THE PART THE TECHNICIAN IDENTIFIED AS MALFUNCTIONING (HYDRAULIC ASSEMBLY R-4683398) WAS NOT A PART OF RECALL 96V-099 # 685. THE ABS PUMP IS PART OF THE RECALL AND WAS TO BE WARRANTED FOR LIFE. THE RECALL ALSO STATES THAT REPAIRS DONE EARLIER TO THIS PART WERE TO BE REIMBURSED AS A PART OF THIS RECALL.     I AWAIT INFORMATION ON HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO OBTAIN AND INSTALL REPAIR PARTS. THE REPAIR ESTIMATE IS $999.84. THE VAN WAS PURCHASED USED FOR $1800. REPAIRS ARE NEARING THAT VALUE. ACCORDING TO COMPLAINTS AND THE ENGINEERING EVALUATION THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM.

IRONICALLY THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED IN ACCORDANCE TO RECALL NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 97V079000 IN FEB 98.  HOWEVER, THE BOLT WAS NOT REPLACED, ONLY THE WASHERS AS DECRIBED BY THE RECALL NOTICE.  THIS REMEDY WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO PREVENT THE BOLT FROM SHEARING.  BYERS DUBLIN DODGE IN DUBLIN, OHIO WHO ORIGINALLY SERVICED THE VEHICLE FOR RECALL REPLACED BOTH CYLINDERS AT NO COST TO US UNDER RECALL.  HOWEVER, I DID NOTIFY CHRYSLER DIRECTLY AND SPOKE TO CHRIS NEHOFF IN CUSTOMER SERVICE ON MAY 26.  AT THAT TIME CHRYSLER INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL REGARDING THIS PROBLEM, THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT I WAS INJURED BUT THAT THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO TALK TO A SUPERVISOR.  AT THAT TIME THE VIN NUMBER I PROVIDED WAS THE ONE FROM THE OWNER'S MANUAL WHICH WAS INCORRECT.  THIS WAS EITHER AN INVALID VIN OR BELONGED TO ANOTHER VEHICLE BUT THE CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT REALIZE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER FINDING THE RECALL NOTICE MYSELF ON YOUR WEBSITE, I CONTACTED BYERS DUBLIN DODGE ABOUT THE RECALL.  THEY IN TURN CALLED THEIR DISTRICT MANAGER WHO APPARANTLY APPROVED THE REPAIR AT NO COST TO US AND KEPT THE BROKEN HYDRAULIC CYLINDER.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VIN WAS INCORRECT, AN ERROR CHRYSLER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT, I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHY I WASN'T TOLD ABOUT THE RECALL WHEN I CONTACTED CHRSYLER, AND THE FACT THAT OUR VAN HAD EVEN BEEN SERVICED FOR SUCH A RECALL.  MOREOVER, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SUCH A HEAVY OBJECT CAN COME CRASHING DOWN WITHOUT NOTICE AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURE ANYONE-ESPECIALLY A SMALL CHILD.  *AK",

WE COULD NOT GET THE DOOR CLOSED NOR WOULD IT COMPLETELY COME OFF THE TRACK.  I CALLED THE KOONS BODY SHOP.  SOME MECHANICS CAME, TOOK THE DOOR OFF AND THEN SOMEHOW REATTACHED IT.  IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN STANDING WHERE THE SLIDING DOOR LANDED A SERIOUS INJURY WOULD HAVE RESULTED.  THE MANUFACTURER ASSUMED NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM.  I AM SURE IT IS SOME KIND OF DEFECT IN THE DOOR.  I HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF.  I APPEALED ALL THE WAY TO THE ARBITRATION BOARD BUT THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL SINCE I WAS PAST THE 12-MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD.   I THINK THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED WITH SOME FREQUENCY WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE THE BODY SHOP REPAIRMAN WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM.  I AM ALSO HAVING SOME PROBLEMS CURRENTLY (2/27/99) WITH THE RIGHT PASSENGER DOOR WHICH IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND AN INDEPENDENT REPAIRMAN HAS CONFIRMED THAT HE SEES THIS QUITE OFTEN.
