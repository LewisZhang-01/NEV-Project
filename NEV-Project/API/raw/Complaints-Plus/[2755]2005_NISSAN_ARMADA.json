THE TRUCK DIED OUT COMPLETELY!  FUEL GAUGE SHOWED I HAD ABOUT 1/4 TANK OF GAS SO I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY ENGINE.  I HAD JUST BOUGHT THE CAR 4 DAYS PRIOR (NO WARRANTY) SO I WAS REALLY UNSURE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON!  STATE PATROL HELPED GET ME OVER TO TOWING ZONE AND I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED HOME.

I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER SVCS AND WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SPECIFIC RECALL BUT TO TAKE IT IN TO DEALER TO VERIFY/ CONFIRM ISSUE.  I DID SO THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND THE MECHANIC AT OLYMPIA NISSAN GLADLY CONFIRMED ISSUE WITH FUEL SENDING UNIT AND WAS QUOTED $465.00 PLUS TAX TO REPLACE, WHICH NISSAN WOULD NOT COVER.  SURPRISINGLY, I RECEIVED A CALL EARLIER TODAY FROM MELODY WITH NISSAN CONSUMER SVCS TO INFORM ME THAT SHE WAS ESCALATING MY ISSUE REGARDING FUEL SYSTEM.  I COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT ON THE FREEWAY WITH THE TRUCK LOSING POWER LIKE THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN GAS GAUGE CLEARLY SHOWS TRUCK STILL HAS GAS!

AFTER DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HOW MANY NISSAN OWNERS WERE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND HOW THE DEALERSHIP CAN NOT REALLY FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE OUR 1ST INCIDENT BACK IN 2009 AND IT IS EXTREMELY SCARY. I HAVE READ OTHER PEOPLES COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET OF THE SAME ISSUE AND NISSANS SUPPOSED FIXES THAT END UP NOT WORKING AND COSTING PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. I SIMPLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE WITHOUT FEAR OF MY BRAKES GOING OUT AND PUTTING MYSELF, CHILDREN AND OTHERS IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. NISSAN NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION AND FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP BECAUSE IF HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL OFF ON TO THE SHOULDER OR OFF INTO A GAS STATION WHEN THIS HAPPENS WITH NO WARNING IT COULD RESULT IN INJURY OR POSSIBLY DEATH. I AM ABOUT READY TO GO TO THE NEWS WITH THIS STORY BECAUSE NISSAN IS NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM NOR IS THERE A RECALL FOR THE ISSUE.

LOUD NOISE IS SCARY WHILE BRAKES NOT FIRING IN THE USUAL PEDDLE POSITION AND FEEL LIKE MUSH.

I STOOD ON THE BRAKE PEDDLE WITH MY EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY TO TRY TO GET THE NISSAN ARMADA TO STOP.  I COULD NOT SHIFT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL BECAUSE THE SHIFTING LOCK SEEMED TO ENGAGED.  I ENDED UP TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND WAS ABLE TO STOP. I CALLED NISSAN AMERICA TO REPORT THIS ISSUE.  ALSO STOPPED BY THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND SERVICE MANAGE INFORMED ME THAT THE BRAKING ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY THE DELTA SENSOR IN THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND WAS A KNOW ISSUE BUT THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD ABOUT THE SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATION WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES AT LOW SPEED AND THAT HE ONLY HAD HEARD ABOUT THE SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATION WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  HE SAID THIS WAS CAUSED ALSO BY THE DELTA SENSOR IN THE BRAKE BOOSTER.  I THINK I UNDERSTOOD HIM IN SAYING THAT WHEN THIS SENSOR FAILS IT ALLOWS THE BOOSTER TO INJECT AIR INTO THE INTAKE THAT CAUSES THE CAR TO ACCELERATE.

DID MORE RESEARCH AND FOUND THIS WEB SITE HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F0FFEA4 WERE THERE WERE OVER 100 POST OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THERE ARMADA. LUCKY I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH THIS ISSUE, BUT I FEEL AS IF MY DAY IS COMING. MY VEHICLE IS PAID OFF, AND I DON'T FEEL AS IF THIS IS A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE OF THE VEHICLE, AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE NISSAN IS REFUSING TO REPAIR AN SAFETY ISSUE WITH ONE IF IT VEHICLES. PLEASE HELP, RESOLVING THIS ISSUE COULD PREVENT ME OR SOMEONE ELSE FROM HAVING AN ACCIDENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT COULD HELP SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LOOK AT THE WEB SITE I PROVIDED. I FEEL AS IF THE THERE MAY NOT BE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REPORT ISSUES.  *TR",

AFTER SOME TIME WE WHERE FINALLY ABLE TO GET TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP IN COVINGTON. AS SOON AS THE SERVICE MANAGER LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE HE NEW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE TAIL PIPE HAD DISCONNECTED FROM THE MUFFLER AND THAT THE HOT EXHAUST BURNED UP THE WIRE HARNESS THAT CONTROLLED ALL THE POWER TO THE TRANSMISSION. THIS THEY HAD SEEN AND FIXED 4 TO 5 TIMES AT THIS DEALERSHIP. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE PIPING FROM THE MUFFLER SOME HOW ERODED AWAY AND DISCONNECTED ALLOWING THE EXHAUST TO BURN UP THE WIRE HARNESS, AS WELL AS THE HOSE THAT SUPPLIES THE COMPRESSED AIR TO THE AIR SHOCKS. THIS TO ME IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. FORTUNATELY WE WERE IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE AND NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE NEAR TO CAUSE A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT. WE WERE ABLE TO GET OVER SAFELY ALTHOUGH WE HAD LOST ALL TRANSMISSION POWER GOING UP THIS MOUNTAIN. NOT SURE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS REPORTED THIS SAFETY ISSUE.

THE NEXT MORNING, I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, SAW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS. I CALLED NISSAN DIRECTLY & OPENED A CASE. MADE AN APPT AT THE DEALERSHIP, THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. AFTER INSPECTION THEY TOLD ME IT WAS MY BRAKE BOOSTER & IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND REPROGRAMMED & IT COST $975. I CALLED NISSAN TO LET THEM KNOW THE COST & ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE SINCE IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PART. I WAS INFORMED TO NOT PICK UP MY VEHICLE UNTIL I HEARD FROM THEM. I HAD RENTED A CAR FROM THE DEALERSHIP. NISSAN TOOK 5 DAYS TO RESPOND & CALLED AT 5:30PM TO SAY SORRY WE DECIDED NOT TO HELP. SO NOT ONLY DID I PAY FOR THE PART, REPROGRAMMING & SERVICE, I ALSO HAD TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL AS WELL! THEY DENIED ME FOR TWO REASONS, MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY & I DID NOT HAVE IT SERVICED AT A DEALERSHIP. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! BECAUSE OF THAT I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN EVER AGAIN! AND I LOVE MY CAR... THEY NEED TO OWN THE PROBLEM! PEOPLE ARE AT RISK BECAUSE OF FAULTY PROGRAMMING AND PARTS. THEY WILL PROBABLY WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO DIE BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY TAKE ANY ACTION!   *JS",

NISSAN CLAIMED IT HAS BEEN EVERYTHING FROM THE SEATBELT TENSIONERS, SENSOR MODULES UNDER THE SEATS TO BAD ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS.  ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BUT MY DASH LIGHTS SHOW I STILL HAVE INOPERATIVE AIRBAGS.  THE SRS SYSTEM ON MY ARMADA IS CURRENTLY IN FAILURE AGAIN AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY NISSAN AGAIN TO ATTEMPT TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  I ALSO HAVE A SECOND ISSUE WITH THE ABS BRAKES ACTIVATING RANDOMLY DURING NORMAL SLOW SPEED STOPS IN WHICH THE BRAKES SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND WITH LITTLE STOPPING FORCE.  IT SEEMS THE ABS SYSTEM IS ACTIVATING UNDER LIGHT OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS.  THIS HAS BEEN A RE-OCCURRING PROBLEM EACH SUMMER.  NISSAN CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO I HAVE BEEN SENT HOME WITHOUT REMEDY.  I AM COMPLAINING BECAUSE I HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE EXCEPT TO WARN OTHERS BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED THROUGH THE FAILURE OF THE BRAKES OR THE AIRBAGS.  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY MANNER.  *TR",

FORTUNATELY, IT DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, BUT THE BRAKES WHEN APPLIED DID NOT CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO STOP AND THERE WAS A GRINDING NOISE WHEN I APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE PEDAL.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A CODE C1179 WHICH REQUIRED THEM TO REPLACE THE BRAKE BOOSTER SENSOR.  THE REPAIR WAS OVER $800 WHICH INCLUDED THE COST OF TOWING THE VEHICLE.    I HAVE LEARNED THAT NISSAN ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THE ISSUE ON MAY 12, 2006.  MY HUSBAND COMPLAINED TO NISSAN, BUT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR.      MY VEHICLE HAD APPROXIMATELY 79,000 MILES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  I AM CONCERNED WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT WAS A FAILURE OF A SAFETY SYSTEM OF THE VEHICLE WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  IN MY SITUATION, I HAD JUST REPLACED MY FRONT BRAKE PADS TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  MY VEHICLE WAS WELL-MAINTAINED AND REGULARLY INSPECTED BY THE DEALER.   *TR",

I MADE A VIDEO OF ONE OF MY INSTANCES @ HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=BMTPOFDBJR8    I FIRST EXPERIENCED THE BRAKING PROBLEM BACK IN 3/06 WITH ~12,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUE, BUT IT HAD HAPPENED TO ME 3-4 TIMES PRIOR TO GETTING IT TO THE DEALER.  DURING THE VISIT, THEY PERFORMED THE JUDDER BRAKE BULLETIN SERVICE.  THE DESCRIPTION OF THE JUDDER BRAKE BULLETIN DID NOT SEEM TO FIT MY PROBLEM, BUT THE CAR NO LONGER HAD THE ISSUE.  THEN THE ISSUE RECURRED AT ~46,000 MILES IN 10/08.  AGAIN THE BRAKES DID NOT HAVE FULL POWER FOR 3-5 TIMES PRIOR TO GETTING IT TO THE DEALER.  I WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEM TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC, BUT WHEN HE SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE, THE PROBLEM RESOLVED.  I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER.  THE COMPUTER DID NOT HAVE ANY REPAIR CODES STORED, BUT THEY PERFORMED TSB 06-040, A COMPUTER SOFTWARE UPDATE.  THE CAR WAS FINE UNTIL 6/25/10 WHEN THE PROBLEM RECURRED.  IT OCCURRED THREE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  I STARTED TRACKING THE OCCURRENCES:  6/27 X 1, 6/28 X1.  I MADE A APPOINTMENT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 6/29.   I KEPT THE CAR AND IT REPRODUCED THE PROBLEM 7/1 AND 7/4@ 70,697MILES.  I MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THE CAR AND GET A LOANER SO THAT THEY COULD HOPEFULLY REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.  DURING THIS JULY 10 VISIT THEY HAD THE CAR OVER 3 WEEKS AND COMPLETED 2 SOFTWARE UPDATES @ NC.  ON 9/2/10  @ 72,449 MILES, THE BRAKING PROB HAS RECURRED. *TR",

AT 53000 I WAS DESCENDING THE MOUNTAIN AND IN MY OPINION NOT RIDING THE BRAKES, ALTHOUGH I DELAYED INTO SHIFTING IN TO LOW. THE GRADE ON THE DESCENT WAS VERY STEEP AND ALL I REMEMBER IS THE BRAKE LIGHT  AND A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE AND A GRADUAL THEN DRAMATIC DECREASE IN MY BRAKABILITY. I WAS SHAKEN AND PULLED OVER. IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES I PROCEEDED A LITTLE MORE AND FOUND THE BRAKE TO ALMOST DISAPPEAR. I LUCKILY FOUND A DRIVEWAY ON AN INCLINE AND PULLED UP AND PUT IT IN PARK.   I SAT AND WONDERED WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I WAS IN SUCH A DANGEROUS MOUNTAIN CURVE THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET HELP IN.  WHEN I CALMED DOWN, I CALLED MY BROTHERS TO HELP ME AND LET THEM KNOW MY LOCATION.  WHEN I SAW A CHANCE I PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE AND BACKED UP, PUTTING THE ARMADA IN DRIVE TO REACH A PULL OFF POINT GOING UPHILL.  I SHUT THE NISSAN OFF AND GOT OUT AND WAITED.  AFTER A HALF AN HOUR MY BROTHERS SHOWED UP AND DROVE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT  ANY PROBLEM.   THEY TOLD ME I JUST RODE MY BRAKES AND NEEDED TO LET THEM COOL OFF, BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE RIGHT UNTIL I RECEIVED THIS LIST OF COMPLAINTS AND HEAR THE SAME SYMPTOMS I EXPERIENCED.....I WILL WATCH FOR THIS AGAIN AND SINCE WE HAVE A 6000 LBS FAMILY TRAILER WE HAVEN'T USE YET -I AM EAGER TO GET THE SOLUTION.  NISSAN NEEDS TO TROUBLESHOOT THIS PROBLEM AND RESOLVE THE COMPUTER GLITCH BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  I AM A EXPERIENCED SCHOOL BUS DRIVER AND AN OFF ROAD LOVER AND I WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.......I WOULD NOT LIKE AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER TO HAVE THE SAME SITUATION.  I HAD NO PARTS REPLACED BECAUSE MY FAMILY CONVINCED ME I WAS AT FAULT AND RODE THE BRAKES HEATING THEM UP, AND I JUST HAD NEW BRAKES  BEFORE WE LEFT ON VACATION. *TR",

ONCE SHE FINALLY CAME TO A STOP AND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON, EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE REPS, AND THEY SAID THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND NISSAN HAVEN'T DONE A RECALL (THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS).  THIS IS VERY ALARMING BECAUSE I OWN AN ?05 ARMADA THAT MY WIFE DRIVES WITH OUR TWO CHILDREN.  I WENT ONLINE, AND FOUND CASES OF THIS HAPPENING ALL OVER WITH TOO MANY CLOSE CALLS.  HTTP://X.NISSANHELP.COM/FORUMS/ARMADA/1852-BRAKE-PROBLEMS.HTML  ... IS JUST ONE FORUM LINK I WILL ATTACH WHERE YOU CAN READ ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET NISSAN TO DO SOMETHING QUICKLY, OR PEOPLE WILL GET HURT OR EVEN KILLED! THANKS, MIKE QUIRIN  *TR",

TURNED OFF VEHICLE.  CALLED FOR MY HUSBAND TO HELP.  WHEN HE ARRIVED, I STARTED THE CAR AND THE PROBLEM WAS GONE.  I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL DEALER IN MANCHESTER, TN (ROBERTS NISSAN 931-728-2212).  AT THAT TIME, THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE VIBRATION OR TO FIND THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY WENT AHEAD AND CHANGED OUT SOME BRAKE PADS AND DID SOME REPAIR ON THE ROTORS.  I HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEMS UNTIL THIS MONTH.  THIS TIME MY HUSBAND WAS WITH ME WHEN THE SAME VIBRATION OCCURRED.  HE THOUGHT THAT IT FELT LIKE THE ABS WAS TRYING TO KICK IN FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.  I HAD NEVER HAD AN ABS VEHICLE, SO I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH THAT TYPE OF BRAKING REACTION.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND TOLD THEM THAT THE EXACT SAME THING HAD HAPPENED AGAIN AND THAT I WAS BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO THEM. THIS TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD SEEN THAT SAME TYPE OF THING ON A TITAN TRUCK RECENTLY.  SURE ENOUGH, AFTER CHECKING THEY DISCOVERED AN ABS TRANSDUCER NEEDED REPLACING.  IT WAS BACK ORDERED, AND THEY GAVE ME ANOTHER CAR TO DRIVE BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT IT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE PROBLEM OCCURRING WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED ON THE INTERSTATE.   ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTICED AND REPORTED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, NISSAN WOULD NOT FULLY COVER THE REPAIR.  IT APPARENTLY WAS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE DEALER WAS TRYING TO HELP, BUT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH NISSAN AND FILED A COMPLAINT (FILE #5775171).  I FELT THAT MY REPAIR BILL SHOULD'VE BEEN COVERED ENTIRELY.  I ALSO WONDER IF PERHAPS A RECALL SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON THE SAFETY ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT THE PART WAS BACK ORDERED WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THERE MAY BE MANY OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY REPAIR BILL WAS $782.67.",

TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED IT FROM AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH STEERING WHEEL SHAKING, WHICH THE SERVICE ADVISOR EXPLAINED, IS DUE TO ROTOR BECOMING HEATED AND WARPED. HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE A TEMPORARY FIX  FOR THE PROBLEM - CHANGING BRAKE PADS, ROTORS, AND INSTALLING A BOLT SOMEHWERE, AND THAT NISSAN WAS WORKING ON A PERMANENT FIX. I WISH I NEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE BEFORE I DISHED OUT THE BIG BUCKS. HOPEFULLY, THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT POSE A DEADLY HAZARD IN THE NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE.*AK",
