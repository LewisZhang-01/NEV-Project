        "summary": "The auto in question was, and is, under the new car warranty - While driving forward, one of the automobile's display screens displayed an error message stating \"Transmission error - Reverse gear not available\"; this in itself is not a major issue as the car was in a forward gear.  The major safety issue is that the car would not shift gears once this error message cam up.  The error has occurred multiple times and, thankfully, did not happen at a critical time - i.e. merging onto a highway.  The first time this happened was on August 6, 2020.  Porsche was notified of the issue and I was told there was no fix at the time.  It happened multiple other times and every time the dealer told me that there wasn't a fix.  Porsche did apply a \"temporary\" fix in the November/December, 2020 timeframe, but this was not permanent and the error happened at least once more after the fix.  I continued to check in with the dealer and was always told there was no resolution.  In June, 2021 I reached out to Porsche directly, they responded one month later and said they would investigate.  In July I was told that there might be a fix by the dealer, but was never called back. I have requested that Porsche buy-back the vehicle given this history, but they indicated that there was a fix and that they would not provide any further resolution.  The dealer has applied a software \"fix\", but I have no faith that this will be permanent, given their history and that it took longer than a year to possibly resolve.  This is not unique to my vehicle, per online message boards",
