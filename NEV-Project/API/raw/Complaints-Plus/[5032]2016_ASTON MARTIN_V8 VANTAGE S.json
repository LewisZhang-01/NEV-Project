I THEN CALLED THE DEALER I LEASED THE CAR FROM AND WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF OPTIONS, NONE OF WHICH WORKED.   I WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEAVE MY $160,000 CAR OVERNIGHT IN A VERY BAD NEIGHBORHOOD AND ASTON MARTIN WOULD PICK IT UP THE NEXT DAY.  I WAS TOLD OVER A WEEK LATER THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED.  LESS THAN 30 DAYS   LATER THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED EXCEPT THIS TIME I WAS SIDE-SWIPED/REAR-ENDED BY A CAR GOING 70 MPH AND MY CAR AT A NEAR STOP.  MY CAR WAS TOTALED COMPLETELY WITH ALL THE RIGHT SIDE AIR BAGS GOING OFF.  MY INSURANCE WOULD NOT COVER IT SAYING IT WAS A DEFECT WITH ASTON MARTIN.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SINCE I CAN'T AFFORD THE REPAIRS.  THE PERSON THAT HIT ME ONLY HAD $5,000 INSURANCE COVERAGE.  PLEASE HELP.",
