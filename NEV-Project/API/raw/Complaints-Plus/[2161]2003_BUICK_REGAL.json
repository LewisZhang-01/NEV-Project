THEN, ONE MORNING ON MY WAY TO WORK, THE CAR COMPLETELY LOST ALL POWER WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  LATER THAT DAY IT HAPPENED AGAIN.    THE FIRST TIME IT LOST POWER, I HAD JUST PUT THE TURN SIGNAL ON AND SLOWED DOWN TO GO AROUND A CAR IN ORDER TO GET INTO MY TURNING LANE.  IF I HAD NOT ALREADY BEGUN TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL, I WOULD HAVE HIT THE BUMPER OF THE CAR IN THE LANE TO MY RIGHT.  I WAS ABLE TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK.  FORTUNATELY--- ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS MORNING RUSH HOUR---I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERSECTION.      I PROCEEDED ON TO WORK WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT EXCEPT THAT MOST OF THE DASH LIGHTS HAD COME ON AND REMAINED ON.   WHEN I PULLED TO END OF THE DRIVEWAY AS I LEFT WORK, THE CAR AGAIN STOPPED.

WHILE WE WERE DRIVING DOWN INTERSTATE 55 I ACCELERATED TO GO AROUND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  WHEN I STEPPED ON THE GAS TO ACCELERATE, THE DASH LIGHTS ALL WENT RED, AND THE VEHICLE STALLED. IT LOST ALL POWER. THIS WAS VERY SCARY AND COULD HAVE COST MANY LIVES. I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE SHOULDER BY COASTING THERE. AFTER SITTING THERE IN DISBELIEF OF WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. THE VEHICLE WAS STILL RUNNING SO I PUT IT INTO DRIVE AND TRIED TO ACCELERATE AGAIN TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC, BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTARTED IT. AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP, SO I PULLED INTO TRAFFIC AND PROCEEDED HOME.  HOWEVER THE VEHICLE WAS RUNNING AT LESS POWER. EVEN THROUGH THE SPEEDOMETER READ 65 I WAS NOT GOING 65 I WAS GOING MORE LIKE 55 ON THE INTERSTATE. MY HUSBAND NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE ALSO. WHEN WE REACHED OUR HOME, WE UNLOADED THE SUITCASES AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR AND I HAVE MY REPAIR WORK DONE. (WE BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW FROM THE DEALERSHIP) AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR DAYS THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE, BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP.  WE ONLY HAVE A LITTLE OVER 57,000 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE AND IT IS STILL UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WE TOOK OUT ON IT WHEN WE BOUGHT IT. PLEASE HELP US WITH THIS PROBLEM.

AS I WAS DRIVING HOME ON FEBRUARY 4, 2005 FROM RUNNING ERRANDS, MY SEAT HEATER IN THE DRIVER SEAT BECAME SO HOT THAT I HAD TO PULL OVER AND PUT MY WINTER COAT DOWN TO SIT ON IN ORDER TO FINISH THE DRIVE HOME.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY HOME, I PULLED INTO THE GARAGE AND TURNED THE CAR OFF.  A SHORT TIME LATER, I SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING.  I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE THAT WAS ON FIRE.  I LOOKED OUT INTO THE GARAGE AND THE INSIDE OF MY BUICK WAS ON FIRE.  I CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT WAS LOCATED ABOUT ONE BLOCK FROM MY HOME.  THEY CAME IMMEDIATELY AND PUT OUT THE FIRE AS WELL AS DISCONNECTED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SO THAT MY HOME WOULD NOT CATCH ON FIRE.   I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTACTED GM ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  I WAS TOLD THAT A WRECKER WOULD COME WITHIN TWO HOURS AND PICK UP THE CAR AND TAKE IT TO THE NEAREST DEALER.  THE WRECKER DID PICK UP THE VEHICLE ON FEB. 4TH AND TRANSPORTED IT TO ERIC DICKERSON BUICK IN INDIANAPOLIS.  A DIAGNOSTICS WAS RUN ON MONDAY FEBRUARY 7TH.  IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT THERE WAS A SHORT IN THE WIRING FOR THE SEAT HEATER.  AS A RESULT, THE ENTIRE CAR WAS TOTALED.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH BUICK AND ASKED THAT THE CAR BE REPLACED.  AFTER MANY WEEKS OF BEING PUT OFF BY GM, WE WERE OFFERED A SETTLEMENT BY GM TO NOT SUE THEM.  I WAS ALLOWED TO PURCHASE A NEW 2005 BUICK LACROSSE, HOWEVER, I HAD TO GIVE THEM MY CAR AND $3,528.62 OF MY SAVINGS.  GM DID PAY FOR MY CAR RENTAL FOR THE TIME I NEEDED ONE.  I BELIEVE GM SHOULD HAVE REPLACED MY CAR WITH A NEW ONE AT NO COST TO ME.  THEY LEFT ME NO CHOICE.  I HAD TO HAVE A CAR.  PLUS, THEY ARE NOT RECALLING THIS VEHICLE.  I THINK ALL OF THEM SHOULD BE CHECKED.  THIS WAS VERY UPSETTING TO ME AS I AM NEARLY 80 YEARS OLD.    BUT, THIS INCIDENT SCARED ME AND LEFT ME WITH A DEPLETED SAVINGS ACCOUNT.  BUT, IT WAS CHEAPER THAN GOING OUT AND BUYING A NEW OR USED CAR SIMILAR TO MY 2003.*AK",

THE THROTTLE SPRING LET GO.  I FOUND MYSELF CLUTCHING THE STEERING WHEEL WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR.  I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH AND THE BRAKES WOULDN'T WORK.

AS I RUSHED DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE PARK BRAKE ON, I ALSO PRESSED ON THE REGULAR BRAKES AND THAT FINALLY WORKED ENOUGH THAT I COULD SLOW DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH.  I DROVE ONTO THE SHOULDER AND TURNED THE IGNITION OFF.  SMOKE ROSE ALL AROUND THE CAR.   I STAYED CALM AND TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO BE IN THE RIGHT LANE IF I ROLLED THE CAR.
