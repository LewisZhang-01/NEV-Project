IT HAS COME DOWN ON MY HEAD MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.  THE LAST TIME WAS TODAY IN A WIND.  IT CUT MY HEAD.  I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEALER ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY IT IS DESIGNED AND TO GET A STICK TO HOLD IT UP.   THE FIRST DAY I OPENED THE TRUNK WHEN I BOUGHT IT, IT CAME DOWN ON MY HEAD.   I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A CHILD GOT HIT BY THE TRUNK LID.  *JB",
