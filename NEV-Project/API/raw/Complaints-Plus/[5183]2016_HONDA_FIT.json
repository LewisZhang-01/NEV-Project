        "summary": "The breather tube for the CVT transmission becomes clogged, causing the rubber fill plug to pop out and spill CVT fluid and allow water, dirt, rocks, and other debris to enter directly into the transmission.  This has caused a slipping of the transmission at low speed when accelerating from a stop. Several times, when pulling out on a main road, it will stutter and not apply power to accelerate properly. I am genuinely concerned that it's going to cause me to get hit by an oncoming vehicle. There is no warning as to when the plug will pop out again and it's in a difficult to locate area underneath the engine air intake, which must be removed to access the plug. It's not easily visible to see when it has popped out.  There were no warning lights or signs of the plug being popped out of place until the transmission began having issues with acceleration.  This is currently a known issue to the NHTSA reported here at this link (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2019/MC-10165374-0001.pdf) however, I am elevating the concern that putting the plug back in place is not an adequate solution, and noting that the known issue is causing transmission issues.  I would like to emphasize that this is a wide spread issue amongst these Honda CVT transmissions as shown in the NHTSA link above.  I am trying to stick to the facts that I know, and based on my research into the failure rate of these CVT transmissions, I am recommending that a closer look be taken into this issue, as I am finding many testimonies of people having the same issues I am encountering. Thank you.",

This generally happened on cold mornings and the display would revert to normal within 10 minutes to one hour.  We took it to dealer where vehicle purchased in Phoenix, who was unable to recreate the problem and therefore they did nothing.  The problem has persisted since then but recently has worsened to the point where the display is blank almost all of the time and not working in hot weather as well. The only time I can see the gauges is when first starting car in morning, and then it often doesn't work to get to different functions one accesses by pushing a knob/button next to that display -- and stops working completely a short time later.  I feel this is a dangerous problem because we can't tell how much gas we have in the car, can't determine mileage via odometer there and lack other key vehicle information that the manufacturer decided to put in a digital panel that is blank or goes blank most of the time. On my listing below of when this incident occurred, that is to indicate when the problem started happening, more or less. The incident has been ongoing since then. The problem started when vehicle had around 20-25K miles and we are now at 58K -- though it's hard for me to tell mileage because I can so rarely see the odometer.  I believe odometers and probably fuel gauges are legally required to work in vehicles and mine has been faulty for years and during the warranty period. A recall is needed. Honda is charging more than $1,000 to replace these faulty displays on Honda Fits that are no longer under warranty, like mine, I am told.",

SEVERAL MORE TIMES IT WOULDN'T START THE FIRST TIME BUT THE 2ND AND 3RD TIME TRYING IT TURNED OVER AND STARTED. MY NEIGHBOR TOLD ME IT COULD BE ELECTRICAL.    THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 10-15 TIMES AND AFTER TRYING 3-4 TIMES IT STARTS RIGHT UP.  I FINALLY TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC WHEN TESTED HE SAID IT WAS THE STARTER AND SAID I NEEDED A NEW ONE.   IT WILL COST $500.00 FOR THE NEW PART PLUS LABOR. WELL OVER $700.00 DOLLARS.   THANK GOODNESS I PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. I WILL HAVE TO PAY $44.00 BECAUSE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ONLY ALLOWS \"AT COST\" FOR PARTS.

THE PART # IS74641-T5R-A00. THE WOLFCHASE HONDA DEALER CHARGED US $418.37 TO REPLACE THIS PART .I WENT ONLINE TO CAR COMPLAINTS.COM AND THEIR WERE SEVERAL NHTSA MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS/ COMPLAINTS ON THE 2015 AND 2016 HONDA FIT CONCERNING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH OTHER HONDA FIT OWNERS. ONE OWNER SAID THAT 4 PLASTIC SCREWS WERE ALL THAT HELD THIS COVER ON THE CAR. THE PLASTIC SCREWS MUST NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE THE EFFECTS OF BUMPY ROUGH ROADS OR PRESSURE FROM RAIN WATER CRASHING AGAINST THE COVER. THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD THESE COVERS REPLACED BUT THEY KEPT FALLING OFF.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT AND THAT THE HONDA CO. NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND STOP CHARGING OWNERS 4 TO 5 HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THIS REPAIR. THE PROBLEM MAKES US SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR IN THE RAIN OR BUMPY ROUGH ROADS. WHEN THESE PLASTIC SCREWS  BREAK AND FALL OUT THEY DISLODGE THE COVER FROM THE CAR CAUSING IT TO DRAG THE STREET WITH VERY LOUD NOISES AND RUINING THE PLASTIC ENGINE COVER. I BELIEVE METAL OR STEEL SCREWS COULD HOLD THIS COVER ON  MORE SECURELY. SURELY HONDA CAN DESIGN SOMETHING BETTER FOR THIS PROBLEM.
