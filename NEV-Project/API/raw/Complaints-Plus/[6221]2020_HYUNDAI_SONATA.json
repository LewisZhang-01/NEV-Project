This unwanted deceleration happened on July 28, August 18 and Sept 13.  Each time after pulling to a safe area we turned the engine off, waited a few minutes and turned it back on. Then resumed normal driving speed. Brought it to the dealer after each time. This shut down started after the car was only 4 months old  with 2,983 miles on it.First time they said they couldn't find anything wrong and reset the computer, said if it happens again they will look into it more. The second time they replaced a Body Assy-Throttle and Gasket. The 3rd time they replaced the front wiring assembly control. I have all the repair paper work. We were driving playing Russian roulette wondering when it will happen again. With cars speeding around us we were lucky no one was close on our tail.  This is an extremely dangerous situation.  Each time it was beautiful sunny weather, two times heading to the beach, 3rd time heading to NH after 2 hrs of driving and one hour stopped, resumed driving for 20 min when it happened. No common denominator. I hope that this is not happening to others. I have reported this issue to Hyundai Motors America and they have offered me $500 and 60 days to release them from any liability or claim.

THE TRANSMISSION IN THIS VEHICLE HAS ELECTRONIC SHIFT WITH PUSHBUTTONS.  PREVIOUS TO THE FIRMWARE UPDATE, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD RESPOND INSTANTLY TO DRIVER INPUT FROM THESE BUTTONS.  FOLLOWING THE FIRMWARE UPDATE, THE TRANSMISSION TAKES TWO SECONDS TO RESPOND.  THIS DELAYED ACTION PROHIBITS DRIVER EMERGENCY SHIFTING, CREATING SEVERE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT.  IN MY VEHICLE, I RECENTLY WAS ALMOST INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WHEN THE DELAYED RESPONSE FROM THE TRANSMISSION CAUSED MY VEHICLE TO REVERSE INTO THE OPPOSING LANE OF TRAFFIC AS ACCELERATION WAS ATTEMPTED THINKING THE VEHICLE HAD SHIFTED INTO DRIVE.  UPON ENTERING THE ACTIVE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAFFIC, EMERGENCY ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE WAS PROHIBITED BY THE DELAYED RESPONSE OF THE VEHICLE SHIFTING INTO 'DRIVE' IN ORDER TO MOVE THE VEHICLE FROM THE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAFFIC. PREVIOUS TO THIS INSTANCE, THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS IN VEHICLE SHIFTING WHICH HAVE NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT WHEN THE DRIVER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE VEHICLE IN 'PARK', BUT THE DELAY CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO MOVE FORWARD AS THE DRIVER REMOVES THEIR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE, AND THE CAR MOVES FORWARD TOWARD STATIONARY OBJECTS AND PEOPLE.  THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO HYUNDAI AND THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED YET.  FURTHERMORE, OTHER OBVIOUS FIRMWARE ISSUES IN THE VEHICLE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, ONE IN A DIFFERENT SAFETY SYSTEM.",

THE PROBLEM MAY BE TWO-FOLD: (1) IT SEEMS LIKE THE WIPERS NEEDED ONE MORE SPEED SETTINGS, A FASTER ONE. (2) THE FACTORY BLADES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE. THIS IS A 2 MONTH OLD CAR. IT ALSO SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM ANYTIME I HAD TO TURN THE WIPERS ON THEIR HIGHEST SETTING EVEN LATER ON URBAN FREEWAYS - I NEEDED A HIGHER ONE. I PLAN TO REPLACE THE BLADES AND HOPE THAT HELPS.
