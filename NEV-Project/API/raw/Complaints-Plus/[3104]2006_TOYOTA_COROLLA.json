This is not a driver error.   The car mileage reading is ~40,000.   I found that there are recalls on the Toyota cars (with problems such as cars went of control and accelerated uncontrollably), but not this particular car/VIN #.   (The car\u2019s airbag was on the recall list, but when we stopped at the local Toyota dealership\u2019s service department, the assistant manager always tell us that they are busy, come back next time. It happened more than 3 times.)  After contacting Toyota Corporate, Toyota sent out a third party to do an inspection on the car. The 3rd party inspector downloaded a whole bunch data.   Based on the 3rd party\u2019s findings, Toyota Corporate states that no evidence that the incident was the result of the defect in [this] vehicle.   My mother maintains the car accordingly to the instructions of the local Toyota dealership\u2019s service department.   One strange thing was that the 3rd party inspector told Toyota Corporation that there were a lot fire ants presented in the car at the time of his inspection.   This seems impossible. My family members and the tow truck driver did not find any fire ants before and after the 3rd party\u2019s inspection. The vehicle\u2019s parked at the local Toyota dealership\u2019s parking lot at the time of inspection.   There must be a problem with car when it went out of control.  Please advise, thanks!",

I TOLD THE SERVICE REP THAT I HAD JUST RECENTLY HAD BROUGHT IT IN ON THE RECALL ISSUED REGARDING THE AIRBAG DEFECT. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ME $131 JUST TO DIAGNOSIS IT. I ARGUED THAT IT SHOULD NOT COST ME ANYTHING SINCE THERE WAS INITIAL ISSUES WITH THE AIRBAG. I CALLED THE RECALL PEOPLE AND THEY AGREED WITH ME. I TOOK MY CAR IN AND WAS TOLD BY THE TECH THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO THE SPIRAL COIL CABLE IN THE AIRBAG. HE SAID IT WAS A NONRELATED ISSUE, WHICH I ARGUED HOW COULD IT NOT BE IF ITS RELATED TO THE AIRBAG. HE TOLD ME THAT MY AIRBAG MAY OR MAY NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE OF THE SPIRAL COIL. I FAIL TO SEE HOW THE 2 ARE NOT INTERCONNECTED. IF ONE PART OF THE AIRBAG MANUFACTURING WAS DEFECTED THEN IT ONLY REASONS THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE AIRBAG COULD ALSO BE DEFECTIVE. SINCE THEY BOTH ARE RELATED TO DEPLOYMENT. IF THE MANUFACTURE COULD PRODUCE ONE DEFECTIVE PART OR USE DEFECTIVE MATERIAL WHY COULD IT NOT BE REASONED THAT OTHER PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE TOO. THE MANUFACTURE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC AND INDIVIDUAL SAFETY NOT PROFIT.! UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION I FOUND OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. THEY MADE AND EXPENSIVE PRODUCT AT THE COST OF THE CONSUMER (LIVES, MONEY, TIME, AND SAFETY).ALL AIRBAG ISSUES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL UNTIL THE PROPER ISSUES IS IDENTIFIED. MAYBE THE SENSOR AND THE SPIRAL COIL ARE CONNECTED IN PROPER DEPLOYMENT. THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED ASAP AND ANOTHER RECALL ISSUED BEFORE MORE INJURIES AND DEATHS OCCUR. CONSUMER SAFETY SHOULD BE NUMBER 1 PRIORITY IN FIXING AND RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. I SCARED TO DRIVE MY CAR BUT I HAVE TO.!!! NOT KNOWING IF THE AIRBAG WILL OR WILL NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT OR IF I HIT A POT HOLE IS JUST TO RISKY. TOYOTA SHOULD FIX ALL AIRBAG COMPLAINTS AND ISSUES WITHOUT COST!!!",

THAT MORNING, A GENTLEMAN CALLED ME TO ASK IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO RESCHEDULE MY APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS SHORT-STAFFED.  EVEN THOUGH, I HAD TAKEN THE DAY OFF WORK TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT, I SAID I UNDERSTOOD AND, SINCE I DID NOT KNOW MY WORK SCHEDULE AT THE TIME, WOULD CALL BACK TO RESCHEDULE.

HOWEVER, ON SATURDAY, MARCH 26TH, ROHRICH LEFT A VOICE MAIL MESSAGE  ON MY CELL PHONE TO SAY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS 'SHORT STAFFED' AND TO CALL BACK TO RESCHEDULE.  I CALLED ON MARCH 28TH AND MADE THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY, TUESDAY, MARCH 29TH AT 1:00 P.M.  I DROPPED THE CAR OFF AT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND MY HUSBAND PICKED ME UP SO THAT WE COULD GO OUT FOR LUNCH.  NOT 10 MINUTES LATER, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED ME ON MY CELL PHONE TO TELL ME THEY 'DIDN'T HAVE THE PART' AND I COULD EITHER LEAVE THE CAR UNTIL TOMORROW, WHICH WOULD BE TODAY, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30TH OR PICK UP THE CAR AND RESCHEDULE AND, IF/WHEN I CALL TO RESCHEDULE, ASK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS THE PART.

ALSO, THEIR REPRESENTATIVE WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE AT THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER TOYOTA PROVIDED TOLD ME THAT IF WE DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE, WE COULD GO TO A TOYOTA DEALER AND REQUEST A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE UNTIL TOYOTA IS ABLE TO REMEDY OUR VEHICLE. WHEN I WENT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WITH THAT INFORMATION, THEY TOLD ME IT WASN'T TRUE, AND THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE ANOTHER VEHICLE. MY CONCERN IS THAT TOYOTA IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO GIVE ME ANY KIND OF A TIME FRAME OF WHEN THE REPLACEMENT AIRBAG WILL BE AVAILABLE IN OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY. MEANWHILE, HAVE DECIDED TO NOT USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, BASED ON TOYOTA'S RECOMMENDATION, AND THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR US. IN ADDITION, THE RESALE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE HAS DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE AIRBAG PROBLEM.

I NEED TO KNOW WHEN PARTS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO FIX MY CAR, AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT IT WILL BE SOON. AS IN, NOT ANOTHER TWO MONTHS!

THAT THURSDAY MORNING IT WAS RAINING AND I WAS DRIVING AROUND 50 MILES/HOUR WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE SPEED NEEDLE WENT COMPLETELY TO THE END OF THE SPEEDOMETER AND CAME BACK. IT DID THIS TWICE BEFORE SUDDENLY ACCELERATING AND SENDING THE CAR OFF THE ROAD. MY CAR HIT A TREE FROM THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE BEFORE STOPPING. THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED AND I INCURRED SEVERAL BODILY INJURIES AROUND THE NECK, CHEST, RIGHT SHOULDER, RIGHT HIP AND BACK.   I WAS TAKEN TO THE ER RIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND BACK AGAIN YESTERDAY MONDAY OCTOBER 4, 2010 BECAUSE I COULD NOT MOVE. MY CAR IS STILL IN A TOWING LOT BUT MY INSURANCE WILL MOVE IT TO A COLLISION CENTER IN THE COMING DAYS. I BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE THIS CRASH BUT I AM NOT SURE WHO TO CONNECT WITH DIRECTLY AND HOPE YOU CAN ADVISE.  MY DIRECT LINE IS [XXX].   THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.   [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE A LETTER FROM TOYOTA, I HAVE EMAILED THEM ON OCTOBER 19, 2010 REQUESTING THE RECALL LETTER.

I WAS TOLD THE ENGINE NEEDED NEW PARTS AND BECAUSE OF WARRANTY THERE WILL BE NO COST TO ME. MY CONCERN IS: 1. ACCORDING TO THE RECALL ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY THE MEDIA STATED THAT THIS DEFECT COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS MATTER BECAUSE THE VEHICLE COULD STOP WHILE DRIVING. I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I WAS IN A PARKING LOT. 2. WHY DID TOYOTA TAKE SO LONG TO ANNOUNCE THIS ENGINE PROBLEM.?IF MY ENGINE PROBLEM WAS SIMILAR TO THIS RECALL, WHY DID THEY TAKE 2 YEARS AND 5 MONTHS TO ANNOUNCE THE RECALL? I KNOW TOYOTA HAS BEEN PENALIZED FOR THEIR SLOW DECISION TO RECALL THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEM MAKING RECALL DECISION TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. TOYOTA HAS BECOME TOO BIG TOO FAST AS STATED IN THE MEDIA. I HOPE THEY WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER CONSUMER SAFETY RATHER THAN THEIR PROFIT BY BECOMING THE LARGEST AUTO MANUFACTURE IN THE WORLD.",

THE ENGINE DID NOT STALL, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.      I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAD A BAD BATCH OF ECMS IN 2005-2006 , BUT DID NOT TO RECALL THEM.  INSTEAD, THEY WAITED TO SEE WHICH UNITS ACTUALLY FAILED BEFORE REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE ECMS.      WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THE SERVICE WRITER THAT IT APPEARED TO BE A DEFECTIVE ECM.  HE TOLD ME I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THE ECM AND THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SPARK PLUG MISFIRING.  AFTER THEY CHECKED THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THAT A PLUG HAD FOULED OUT.  I WAS CHARGED OVER $500 TO REPLACE ALL OF THE PLUGS AND THE IGNITION COIL, NOT JUST THE ONE FOULED PLUG .  I WAS ALSO CHARGED $120 TO CLEAN WHAT I WAS TOLD WOULD BE THE FOULED FUEL INJECTOR, BUT IT WAS LISTED AS 'INTAKE CLEANING SERVICE.'

WHILE A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP ULTIMATELY REPLACED THE ECM AT NO COST, I INCURRED RENTAL CAR EXPENSES FOR THE TIME I WAS WITHOUT MY COROLLA, AND PAID PARTS AND LABOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $521.76 TO MY INDEPENDENT MECHANIC TO INITIALLY REPLACE A TRANSMISSION SOLENOID WHICH HAD GONE BAD DUE TO THE FAILING ECM. I WILL NOT EVEN DESCRIBE THE AMOUNT OF MY TIME THAT TOYOTA WASTED BY FAILING TO NOTIFY ME, AS THE OWNER OF A CAR MODEL KNOWN BY TOYOTA TO FREQUENTLY HAVE PREMATURE ECM FAILURE, OF THIS ISSUE SO THAT I COULD RESOLVE IT AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY.  IN EARLY JULY I EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT AND JERKING SHIFTING OF THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN MY TOYOTA. I BROUGHT IT TO MY INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, WHO DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A BAD TRANSMISSION SOLENOID (CODE P2716), AND SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE SOLENOID HAD GONE BAD DUE TO THE ECM FAILING.  AT THAT POINT, CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF MY TRANSMISSION, I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ECM IS COVERED UP TO 8 YEARS/80,000 MILES, AND THAT IF THE SOLENOID HAD GONE BAD AS A RESULT OF THE FAILING ECM, THE SOLENOID REPLACEMENT, TOO, WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE ECM AT NO CHARGE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES I INCURRED, AS WELL AS THE CONSIDERABLE INCONVENIENCE I ENDURED, WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF TOYOTA HAD SHARED PROACTIVELY WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THE FACT THAT FAILING ECMS ARE UNUSUALLY COMMON IN COROLLAS.  IF TOYOTA HAD REPORTED THIS INFORMATION TO ME, I WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS DEMONSTRATED BY MY CAR, AND WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT TO A DEALERSHIP IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO BE FIXED. INSTEAD, I SPENT TIME AND MONEY USING A TRUSTED INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, AND LEARNED OF THE LARGER ECM PROBLEM THROUGH HIM AND THROUGH INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. *TR",

I DID NOT HAVE THEM DO THE WORK BUT IT WILL HAVE TO BE FIXED BECAUSE IF THE BELT BREAKS THEN THE CAR IS DEAD, MUCH LIKE THE ECM PROBLEM (WHICH WAS A LARGE PAIN IN THE...).  THERE WILL BE AN INCIDENT IF I DON'T GET IT FIXED. AND AGAIN I CANNOT HEAR A SQUEAK UNLESS A REALLY LISTEN OR AGAIN I PULL UP TO  A BUILDING. *TR",

THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD WHICH NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . IT COULD BE CORRECTED THROUGH RECALLS BUT SHOULD BE CHANGED AT THE FACTORY DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS. I HAVE TALKED THIS OVER WITH MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND THEY ALL AGREE THAT I AM RIGHT IN MY ASSESSMENT. MOST OF THE DRIVER THAT I REPORT THIS TO DO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEIR TAIL LIGHTS ARE NOT ON WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED. THE TAIL LIGHTS ONLY COME ON WHEN THEY ARE MANUALLY TURNED ON WITH THE DASH SWITCH ON THE STALK. I AM NOT SURE OF WHEN THIS DESIGN FLAW WAS CREATED OR WITH WHAT YEAR VEHICLE BUT I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT IS OCCURRING ON 90% OF THE NEWER VEHICLE ON THE ROAD.

I WAS THANKFULLY ABLE TO GET OFF TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD WITHOUT BEING IN AN ACCIDENT. AFTER I GOT TO THE SHOULDER OFF THE ROAD THE CAR SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS ABOUT TO QUIT RUNNING AND JUST DIE OUT.

HOWEVER, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER WENT OUT EVEN AFTER RESTARTING THE CARE. THIS IS A BIG SAFETLY RISK AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED BY TOYOTA. SOMEONE COULD HAVE HIT ME IN THE BACK END AND IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY HAZARD AND NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED! I WAS VERY UPSET WHEN THIS HAPPENED NOT SURE WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO.

WHEN I HAD THE CAR TOWED INTO THE DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE PERSONNEL VERIFIED THAT ONE OF THE CAR'S COMPUTERS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I SPOKE WITH TWO OF THE SERVICE PERSONNEL AT THE TIME AND BOTH GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THAT YEAR'S COROLLA LE.  I BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT QUESTIONS REGARDING TOYOTA'S PROBLEMS AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS COULD HAVE AN ELECTRONIC ORIGIN. *TR",

IT KEEPS GETTING BANGED UP FROM THESE PROBLEMS AND MY INSURANCE RATES ARE GOING SKY-HIGH. BUT MORE SERIOUSLY, I DRIVE 36,000+ MILES PER YEAR, WHICH MEANS THAT MY EXPOSURE TO RISK IS GREATER THAN MOST DRIVERS. WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

AROUND 5:30PM ON 12/10/2008 I WAS DRIVING HOME AROUND 2-3 MILES PER HOUR DUE TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION. THE SKY WAS DARK AND IT WAS LIGHTLY RAINING. THE TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND 60-65 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, SO ICE WAS NOT PRESENT ON THE ROAD. THE LARGE SEMI TRUCK DIRECTLY AHEAD OF ME SLOWED DOWN TO A STOP, SO I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE. MY BRAKES DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE AN EFFECT, SO I PUSHED ON THE BRAKES HARDER. THE BRAKES STILL HAD NO EFFECT. I IMMEDIATELY SHIFTED THE CAR INTO THE 'PARK' GEAR AND APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. NEITHER THE SHIFTING THE GEARS NOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE CAR'S MOTION, MY CAR KEPT MOVING FORWARD. I EVENTUALLY STOPPED WHEN I SMASHED INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK, WHICH CAUSED ABOUT $5K OF FRONT END DAMAGE FOR MY CAR AND NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK. THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN I NOTICED THE CAR WAS NOT STOPPING TO WHEN MY CAR HIT THE TRUCK WAS AROUND 2-3 SECONDS. AFTER THINKING ABOUT THESE EVENTS AFTERWARD, I DIDN'T REMEMBER HEARING THE TRANSMISSION GRIND DUE TO THE FACT THE CAR WAS IN THE 'PARK', BUT CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD.   AFTER THE COLLISION, THE TRUCK AHEAD OF ME LEFT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. MY CAR STAYED STATIONARY NOW THAT ITS MOMENTUM WAS LOST. I SHIFTED THE CAR BACK INTO 'DRIVE' AND SLOWLY DROVE HOME (AROUND 20-25 MPH). THE BRAKES WORKED LIKE NORMAL AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANY NOISE WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES.  I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON 01/10/2009. THE MECHANIC INSPECTED THE CAR AND FOUND THE BRAKES WERE IN 'NORMAL WORKING CONDITION'. THE MECHANIC HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE BRAKE FAILURE WAS EITHER THE BRAKE FLUID OVERHEATED OR DRIVER ERROR. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT EITHER HYPOTHESIS. NO REPAIR WAS RECOMMENDED AND NO PARTS WERE REPLACED. I AM CONFIDENT I DEPRESSED THE BRAKES AND NOT THE ACCELERATOR, SO I SUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER PROBLEM WITH MY BRAKES.

THIS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED WHEN I HAD THE CLUTCH DEPRESSED AND WAS BRAKING.  I HAVE THOUGHT THAT MY RIGHT FOOT, WHICH I INTENDED TO BE ON THE CENTER OF THE BRAKE PEDAL, WAS ACTUALLY ON THE  SIDE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL SUCH THAT IT SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTACTED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  THIS EXPLANATION IS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT EVEN WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY DEPRESSED, IT IS STILL HIGHER THAN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  THE ONLY WAY I COULD BE DEPRESSING BOTH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME IS FOR MY FOOT TO BE TWISTED AND OFF CENTER AT THE SAME TIME.  MAYBE THIS IS POSSIBLE, I DON'T KNOW.  WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT THE ENGINE RACES(MAYBE 4000 TO 5000 RPM) BUT SINCE THE CLUTCH IS ALREADY DEPRESSED AND MY FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE, THE CAR DOES NOT SPEED UP.  USUALLY THE ENGINE ONLY RACES FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GETS SETTLED DOWN--MAYBE I REPOSITION MY FOOT A LITTLE--I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS UNEXPECTED AND HAPPENS SO QUICKLY I AM LEFT CONFUSED AND SCARED.   THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS A FEW DAYS AGO SO WITH ALL THE PUBLICITY ABOUT TOYOTA ACCELERATOR PEDALS, I THOUGHT I WOULD REPORT THIS PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH MY CAR IS NOT COVERED IN THE RECALL.  *TR",

I BEGAN TO GET CLOSER TO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I DO NOT BELIEVE I INITIALLY TRIED TO PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL.

THEN, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, WHILE ON THE GRAPEVINE PORTION OF HWY 5 AFTER THE SUMMIT, IT DID THE SAME THING WITH LESSER TRAFFIC.  I PUT IT INTO NEUTRAL THIS TIME, HIT THE BRAKE, SLOWED A LITTLE, PUT IT BACK INTO GEAR AND SINCE THEN IT HAS NOT OCCURRED.  SEE NEXT PARAGRAPH.        OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS, THEIR HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL OCCASIONS WITH A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHERE: 1) MY FOOT HAS SLIPPED OFF THE BRAKE ONTO THE ACCELERATOR CAUSING THE ENGINE TO REV WHEN IN NEUTRAL IN THE DRIVEWAY OR A STOPLIGHT (I THINK BECAUSE THE PEDALS ARE SMALL AND VERY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER), AND; 2) OCCASIONS WHEN THE ACCELERATOR HAS GOT STUCK UNDER THE FLOORMAT WHEN THE FLOORMAT HAD SLID FORWARD CAUSING THE CAR TO ACCELERATE.

I HAD TO TOW THE CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS INSPECTED AND FOUND THAT THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE (ECM) HAD FAILED (ERROR CODE P0607) AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT. SINCE THE CAR IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW, I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE \"BRAIN\" OF THE CAR IS OUT OF ORDER AND HAS TO BE REPLACED. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD CAUSE HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS WHERE THE CAR'S ENGINE STALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY WHILE DRIVING AT 65 MPH. MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND DESCRIBE SUCH CASES WHERE EITHER THE CAR'S ENGINE DIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, OR THE CAR LEAVES PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND WON'T START AT ALL (HTTP://WWW.TOYOTANATION.COM/FORUM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=201631).  TOYOTA HAS ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM: TSB EG042-07 (HTTP://WWW.TUNDRASOLUTIONS.COM/FORUMS/ATTACHMENTS/COROLLA-MATRIX/27763D1201041193-2006-OBDII-CODE-P0607-06-CORROLLA-TSB.PDF). INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET SUGGESTS THAT FAULTY SOLENOIDS ON THE ECM BOARD ARE CAUSING THE COMPUTER TO GO CRAZY.  GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA SHOULD BE LEAVING ALL COROLLA AND MATRIX DRIVERS GET STUCK ON THE ROAD BEFORE REPLACING THE FAULTY PARTS. I BELIEVE THAT FOR ANY SUCH ROAD HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS WHERE THE MANUFACTURER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FAULTY PARTS WERE INSTALLED SHOULD RECALL ALL AFFECTED MODELS AND REPLACE THEM ACCORDINGLY.  SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH THING HAS HAPPENED TO ME, I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE BUT JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE SO THAT YOU DECIDE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. MY CONCERN IS THAT CAR MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE PROACTIVE IN SUCH MATTERS AND NOT BE PASSIVE AND WAIT FOR SOMETHING KNOWN TO HAPPEN.

IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE FAILURE MODE HAS A HIGH OCCURRENCE.  AS OF 4/6/2009 THERE WAS A TWO WEEK NATIONAL BACK ORDER OF PCM FOR THIS VEHICLE.

THE COST IS 1,300 OR MORE TO REPLACE EVERYTHING. IT DOESN'T LOOK CONTAMINATED TO ME.  I GOT SAMPLES, TOP, BOTTOM OF RESERVOIR, FRONT RIGHT BLEEDER, LEFT REAR BLEEDER. OTHER THAN THE TOP SAMPLE FROM RESERVOIR WHICH WAS TAKEN USING A DIRTY BATTERY TESTER, ALL OTHER SAMPLES LOOK GOOD. TOOK SAMPLE FROM ANOTHER CAR IN SERVICE AREA WITH BATTER TESTER WHICH HAD BLACK SPECKS COMING OUT PROBABLY BECAUSE BRAKE FLUID ATE AT RUBBER.  AFTER TAKING 3 OR 4 TUBE FULL AND THROWING THEM AWAY THE BLACK SPECKS WENT AWAY AND GOT THE SAMPLE.  THIS SAMPLE WAS TAKEN BY THE OPERATION MANAGER.  SAMPLES OF FRONT/RIGHT, REAR/LEFT, BOTTOM OF M/C WHERE DONE BY TECH AS I HELD BOTTLE.  ALL DONE IN FRONT OF THE MANAGER.  SAID IT WAS THE M/C THAT WAS CAUSING THE BRAKE TO HOLD PRESSURE.  I ASK HOW CAN IT BE ONLY ON ONE SIDE?  IF THE PRESSURE IS AT M/C WHY AREN'T BOTH WHEELS DRAGGING OR LOCKING UP?  I TOOK SAMPLE TO TECH AT ANOTHER DEALER (NOT A TOYOTA DEALER) HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BRAKE FLUID AND TOOK TEST FOR CONTAMINATION WITH FAST STRIP TESTING.  ALL WERE GOOD.  HE ALSO SAID THAT M/C NOT PROBLEM.  THIS IS A NON ABS SYSTEM AND WORKS PRETTY SIMPLE. CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 3 TIMES TO TALK TO TOYOTA REP, DEALER AND TOYOTA REFUSED ACCESS TO REP.

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK AND HE TOLD ME TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  I DID THAT AND IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  WE NEEDED ALL KEYS TO SEE IF IT WAS THE KEYS AND IT WASN'T.  HE THOUGHT IT WAS BAD GAS AND IT WASN'T.  THEN HE SAID IT WAS THE COMPUTER.  THE COMPUTER WAS REPLACED AND I STILL HAVE TROUBLE CRANKING IT NOW.  I WOULD TURN THE KEY AND IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, IT WOULD CRANK.  BEFORE THIS INCIDENCE, IN JULY 2006, NOT EVEN A MONTH AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE, MY BRAKES STARTED SQUEALING AND THEY STILL DO NOW.

THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD WAS DISTORTED. TOYOTA ADMITTED THAT IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED IT A SECOND TIME. THE SECOND REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD HAD DISTORTION.
