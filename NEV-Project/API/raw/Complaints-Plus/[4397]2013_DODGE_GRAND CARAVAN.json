They were aware I never received one, they said due to not having my address, though I have received other communication from Dodge.

SO WHY ISN'T DODGE CHRYSLER ACKNOWLEDGING IT?    THE 'ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT' (AHR) HEADRESTS FOUND IN CERTAIN CHRYSLER VEHICLES AND MANUFACTURED BY GRAMMER AG SUFFER FROM A DEFECT.    THE 65-PAGE LAWSUIT OUT OF FLORIDA ALLEGES THAT ALTHOUGH FCA US AND GRAMMER AG'S ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT IS MEANT TO SPRING FORWARD IN THE EVENT OF A REAR-END COLLISION TO CATCH A VEHICLE OCCUPANT'S HEAD TO PREVENT WHIPLASH, THE FEATURE CAN 'DEPLOY WITHOUT WARNING OR EXTERNAL FORCE FROM A COLLISION, AND FORCEFULLY STRIKE THE BACK' OF A DRIVER OR PASSENGER'S HEAD. DESCRIBING THE APPARENT DEFECT AS COMMON AND UNIFORM, THE CASE CLAIMS THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT TO THE BACK OF A VEHICLE OCCUPANT'S HEAD AND NECK CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY AND CREATES AN ADDITIONAL ACCIDENT RISK SHOULD THE DEFECT MANIFEST SUDDENLY WHILE A VEHICLE IS IN OPERATION.    ACCORDING TO THE LAWSUIT, THE CAUSE OF THE DEFECT IS THE FAILURE OF A 'CHEAP PLASTIC COMPONENT' INSIDE THE DEFENDANTS' AHR. SPECIFICALLY, THE FEATURE CONTAINS A PLASTIC BRACKET THAT ACTS AS THE TRIGGERING MECHANISM AND HOLDS THE FEATURE'S SPRING-LOADED RELEASE IN PLACE UNTIL A SENSOR SIGNALS THAT THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN HIT IN ITS REAR, THE CASE EXPLAINS. AS A 'COST-SAVING MEASURE,' THE PLAINTIFFS SAY, CHRYSLER AND GRAMMER AG DESIGNED THE AHR BRACKET WITH 'AN INFERIOR AND INEXPENSIVE FORM OF PLASTIC' THAT CAN CRACK AND BREAK DOWN PREMATURELY DUE TO THE 75 POUNDS OF CONSTANT PRESSURE APPLIED BY THE AHR'S SPRINGS ONTO THE BRACKET.",

I DROVE TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S HOME IN URBANDALE, IOWA (I DROVE APPROX 11 MILES TO HER HOME AFTER THE LIGHT CAME ON) WHERE WE WERE STAYING OVER THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.  THEN I DROVE TO AN O'REILLEY AUTO PARTS STORE.  THEY CHECKED MY BATTERY, IT WAS OK, EXCEPT THAT IT WAS AT ABOUT 88%.  THEY THEN CHECKED THE ALTERNATOR AND IT WAS NOT CHARGING THE BATTERY.  THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT I COULD DRIVE HOME TO HARLAN, IOWA, A 100 MILE TRIP IF THE BATTERY WERE CHARGED UP FULLY.  I WENT BACK TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S HOME AND CALLED STEW HANSEN DODGE, WHERE I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE ON 29 AUGUST 2013, AS A NEW VEHICLE WITH 18 MILES ON THE ODOMETER .

THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THEY WERE OPEN UNTIL 3:30 PM BUT THEY ONLY DID OIL CHANGES ON WEEKENDS.  I EXPLAINED MY SITUATION OF LIVING 100 MILES OUT OF DES MOINES, IOWA AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING HOME WITH NO ALTERNATOR.  SHE SAID SHE WAS SORRY BUT THEY COULDN'T HELP ME UNTIL NEXT WEEK TUESDAY.  I WENT BACK TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE, CHARGED THE BATTERY UP AND DROVE HOME BACK TO HARLAN, IOWA 100 MILES WEST ON MONDAY, 29 MAY 2017.  MY MILEAGE NOW AT THIS TIME IS 45540.  I DISCOVERED THAT THIS SAME ENGINE WITH THE SAME ALTERNATOR IN \"SOME DODGE CHARGERS\" HAS THE VERY SAME PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN RECALLED, BUT NO NOTIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN SENT TO OWNERS.

THE TOP OF MY SHOE GETS FIRMLY STUCK TRYING TO MOVE BETWEEN THE TWO PEDALS.  IF NOT COMPLETELY STUCK, MY FOOT MOTION IS IMPEDED AND SLOWED DOWN IN MANY OTHER WAYS.  ONLY, WITH A LOT OF THOUGHT AND ADJUSTMENT OF MY FOOT AND HEEL POSITION AM I ABLE TO OPERATE THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR AT ALL.  THIS LOW FOOT CLEARANCE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERS MY RESPONSE TIME WHEN I NEED TO HIT THE BRAKE IN AN EMERGENCY.  IT REQUIRES A LOT OF EXTRA THOUGHT UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS AS WELL, TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE ROAD.      THIS HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE (OR EVEN A THOUGHT) IN MANY YEARS OF DRIVING SEVERAL OTHER MAKES AND MODELS OF VEHICLES.  I OWN A 1999 GRAND CARAVAN THAT HAS PLENTY OF FOOT ROOM IN IT.  NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO SPECIALLY POSITRON THEIR FOOT TO OPERATE THE BRAKE OR ACCELERATOR.  FOR SAFE DRIVING, REACTION TIME IS EVERYTHING.  DODGE HAS DESIGNED THIS VEHICLE WITH CRAMPED FOOT-ROOM THAT CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES TO ACTIVATE THE BRAKE AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT THAT A FREELY AVAILABLE BRAKE PEDAL MAY HAVE AVOIDED.     I HAD THE IDENTICAL PROBLEMS TESTING A NEWER DODGE CHARGER AND A CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY.  I AM MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS CRAMPED AND UNSAFE DESIGN IS A STANDARD THAT COVERS MANY CHRYSLER MAKES AND MODELS.

PICS 1-3 SHOW THE BRAKE POSITION AND HOW THE VEHICLE DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO PIVOT BACK ANY FARTHER FROM TO BRAKE.  THE GAS POSITION SHOWS A NATURAL PIVOT POSITION WHEN GOING FROM THE GAS TO THE BRAKE.

BECAUSE I CARRY A VEHICLE SCANNER WITH ME, I PULLED OVER AT A REST STOP AND CHECKED THE VOLTAGE SENSE PID.  IT SHOWED 12.5V.  THOUGHT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND CONTINUED DRIVING.  APROXIMATELY 400 MILES LATER, VEHICLE EXHIBITED SUDDEN LOSS OF MOMENTUM WHILE IN CRUISE CONTROL AT 72MPH, AS I PRESSED ON THE ACCELARATOR, VEHICLE DOWNSHIFTED AND RPMS ROSE TO 4500, HOWEVER VEHICLE SLOWED EVEN MORE AND I HAD TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION TO GET TO RIGHT SHOULDER.  VEHICLE WENT FROM APPROX 72MPH IN CRUISE CONTROL TO 40MPH IN A MATTER OF FEW SECONDS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO ACCELARATE TO SAFELY GET VEHICLE FROM LEFT LANE ON I-495 S TO RIGHT SHOULDER.  I AGAIN PLUGGED IN MY SCANNER AND HAD CODE P0622 SHOW UP.  AT THIS TIME, CONTROL MODULE VOLTAGE SENSE WAS READING 11V.  AFTER ERASING THE CODE AND MULTIPLE IGNITION KEY CYCLING ATTEMPTS, THE VEHICLE STARTED UP, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE, BATTERY LIGHT WENT OUT AND VOLTAGE WAS AGAIN AT 12.5 V, AND CLIMBING.  WE MADE IT TO OUR DESTINATION (TAUNTON, MA) AND EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND.  ON SEPTEMBER 28, WHILE WE WERE TRAVELLING BACK TO CANADA, WITHIN 40 MILES OF LEAVING TAUNTON, THE BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE VEHICLE LOST POWER AGAIN, AND HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO GET VEHICLE PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY (I-495 N).

ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE....PUMPED THE BRAKE HARD WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK BUT NO LUCK. HELD THE BRAKE PEDAL IN TO THE FLOOR AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO TO COUNTER THE ENGINE AUDIBLY REVING TO GAIN MORE SPEED (HOPING TO SLOW THE ACCELERATE PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND MAYBE HOLD IT AT ITS CURRENT RATE DESPITE THE ENGINE STILL TRYING TO GO FASTER).  I RODE OUT THE UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION ISSUE UNTIL COMING TO A LONG TURN LANE WHERE I VEERED OFF TO GET AWAY FROM OTHER CARS. WTH A BUSY INTERSECTION APPROACHING QUICKLY AHEAD OF ME AND THE BRAKING NOT RESOLVING THE ISSUE, I THREW THE VEHICLE INTO PARK AND AFTER A BRIEF TIME IT FINALLY SLOWED TO A STOP. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKED...I EVEN CHECKED TO SEE IF GAS PEDAL WAS PHYSICALLY STUCK SOMEHOW ON THE FLOOR MAT (IT WAS NOT),  AND LIFTED UP FROM UNDERNEATH IT WITH MY FOOT TO VERIFY THIS, DURING THIS ATTEMPT TO REGAIN SPEED CONTROL..I BELIEVE IT WAS THIS IN ADDITION TO PUTTING VEHICLE IN \"PARK\" THAT ACTUALLY STOPPED THE ENGINE ACCELERATION/REV SO THE VEHICLE COULD PHYSICALLY STOP...    II IS VALID TO NOTE THAT I PREVIOUSLY TOOK THIS VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP (AROUND 36000 MILES) FOR EVALUATION WITH PRIOR CONCERNS OVER THE ENGINE/TRANSMISSION NOT SEEMING TO FUNCTION RIGHT/SMOOTHLY....THE DEALERSHIP REPORTED THAT \"THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.\" & IT WAS RETURNED TO ME WITH NO ADJUSTMENT/REPAIR.

I REMOVED THE ALTERNATOR AND FOUND ONE OF THE SLIP RINGS ALONG WITH ONE BRUSHES COMPLETELY WORN DOWN TO NOTHING. IT'S CLEARLY A DEFECTIVE ALTERNATOR THAT RESULTED IN A VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING SITUATION DUE TO LOSS OF POWER AT 60MPH ON THE HIGHWAY. CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CARE AND THE DEALERSHIP HAD NO SYMPATHY AND EVEN AFTER BRINGING THE ALTERNATOR INTO THE DEALERSHIP THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THEY WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP SO THEY COULD \"DIAGNOSE\" IT AND STILL COULDN'T GUARANTEE A WARRANTIED REPLACEMENT. THE DEALERSHIP WANTED ME TO RE-INSTALL THE FAILED ALTERNATOR AND THEN GET THE CAR TO THEM SOME 30 MILES AWAY IN SOME CHANCE OF THEM COVERING THE COST TO REPLACE IT......SO I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW ALTERNATOR FROM ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AT THE TUNE OF $400 AND INSTALLED IT MYSELF.
