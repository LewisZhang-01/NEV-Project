AGAIN AFTER A FEW MONTHS WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK WHEN THE PROBLEM RESURFACED DUE TO LOW BRAKE FLUID.R. AFTER I DROVE THE CAR OUT OF DEALERS PREMISE, THE ENGINE STARTED GETTING HEATED UP.

HOWEVER, AFTER SEVERAL HOURS THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THE ENGINE WAS STILL GETTING HEATED UP AND DEMANDED AN OPEN AUTHORIZATION SO THAT THEY COULD OPEN UP THE ENGINE. WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW MUCH IT COULD COST ME, THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD COST UP TO $5000. THE DEALER HELD MY CAR FOR OVER 14 DAYS WITHOUT GIVING ME A TEMPORARY CAR OR VERIFYING WHETHER THE ENGINE WAS REALLY GETTING HEATED UP AFTER HE CHANGED THE THERMOCOUPLE. THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE CAR IN THAT CONDITION. AFTER 14 DAYS, DESPITE WRITING TO BMW AMERICA AND THE DEALERS HEAD OFFICE, THE DEALER KEPT ON CLAIMING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO AUTHORIZE THEM FOR FURTHER WORK THAT MIGHT COST ME AT LEAST $1500.
