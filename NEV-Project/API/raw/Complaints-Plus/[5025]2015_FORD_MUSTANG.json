        "summary": "I was driving on Interstate-95 in Washington, DC going about 55 mph in heavy traffic.  Without warning my car lost acceleration and the car almost immediately slowed to approximately 35 mph, despite my foot still being on the accelerator--pushing on the accelerator did nothing.  Then after several seconds, the car sped up again, but when I reached around 40 mph, the car lost acceleration again for several seconds.  It kept doing this over the course of my entire trip, which was about 5 miles.  I had to pull in the shoulder lane driving with my hazards flashing.  After I parked my car and turned it off, I noticed my brake lights were still on.  I googled the issue, and the source of the problem is a faulty transluscent plastic/rubber brake switch stop pad (that is connected to the brake pedal and when the brake is released the brake switch stop pad pushes in the brakeswitch turning off the brake lights), which broke during my trip.  I found the broken pieces on my floorboard (i took a photo of them and kept them). Because the car senses that the brakes are still being applied it cuts power to the accelerator.  This was highly dangerous on the interstate and it broke with no warning.  Fortunately, it didn't cause an accident.  While reviewing the fix (Ford doesn't sell the replacement part; instead they want you to replace the entire brake pedal for about $500) on a Mustang Owner Forum, numerous people echoed the same problem with many having it occur while driving.  The fix involves buying a $5-10 part from Dorman which is made for another vehicle.",

After a few seconds, the car would pick up speed again only to repeat the event over and over again. I understand that when the brake light switch stop pad is missing and the plunger on the switch is fully out, the car thinks that you are applying the brakes. I was lucky, I was on a two lane road with no traffic, but I was headed to an inter-state with heavy traffic. Ford (nor does anyone else) does not sell just the rubber plug which fits on the brake pedal, but it will sell the complete brake pedal assembly.  Not sure the reason that the brake pedal would require the hole that requires the rubber plug, but think that Ford should be responsible for the replacement or a better solution for the repair (Provide a replacement plug, not just the complete Brake pedal assembly.

In researching it appears that the wiring to the camera and other associated trunk area lighting can be cut or worn through, creating a defective and potentially dangerous situation.  The videos and comment sites are abundant with this issue.   During my research, I noticed that there is a huge, nearly identical recall in place for 2020 vehicles.  I suspect this is the same issue.  The issue is not just happening in Mustangs.  Other vehicles where the wiring is sheathed in a certain way or subject to movement can show the same issue.",

IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE WHITE PLASTIC BUTTON ON THE BRAKE LEVER THAT DEPRESSES THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. THIS SEEMS TO DRY AND CRACK AND FALL OFF THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY ,SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS.  SO INSTEAD OF LETTING THE CAR SET ALL DAY AND DRAIN THE BATTERY I HAD MY WIFE DRIVE THE CAR HOME. ON THE WAY HOME SHE EXPERIENCED A RUNNING ISSUE THE CAR SEEM TO SHUTTER WOULD NOT GO ABOVE 30 TO 40 MILES AN HOUR. FORTUNATELY IT WAS ALL SIDE ROADS ON THE WAY HOME. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED GOING DOWN THE INTERSTATE IT COULD'VE BEEN A BIG PROBLEM. FROM WHAT I'VE READ APPARENTLY THE CAR GOES INTO LIMP MODE?  SENSING THAT THE BRAKES HAVE BEEN APPLIED? FROM THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK INTO THE LITTLE PLASTIC BUTTON WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT TWO DOLLARS TO PRODUCE IS NOT AVAILABLE SEPARATE. THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS CAN BE REPLACED IS A BRAKE PEDAL ASSEMBLY WHICH I READ IS APPROXIMATELY $300 PLUS LABOR. SOME PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING A RUBBER CLUTCH PEDAL BUMPER FROM TOYOTA AND PUTTING IN PLACE OF THE PLASTIC ONE FORD HAD.   MY MAJOR ISSUE IS THAT IF SHE WAS ON THE INTERSTATE IN THE CAR SLOW DOWN TO 30 MILES AN HOUR WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

WITH FURTHER INVESTIGATION THRU A RELATIVE WHO WORKS FOR FORD DEALERSHIP IN MI. HE SAID FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEM FOR A FEW YEARS. HE SAID IT WAS EITHER INFERIOR MATERIAL, OR THE PREP WORK THAT CAUSED THE BUBBLING.HE ALSO SAID UP TO 2015 IT WAS 3YRS./36,000 MILES. AFTER 2015 THEY FIGURED OUT THE PROBLEM AND CHANGED THE POLICY TO 5YRS./UNLIMITED MILES. I TALKED TO A PERSON THAT HAD A 2016 MUSTANG GT, AND ASKED IF HAD PAINT ISSUES AND SAID YES ON THE HOOD. HE SHOWED ME, AND IT WAS IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT AS MINE!!! MINE WAS ESTIMATED AT $2577.73, SUPPOSEDLY FORD SAID THEY WOULD PAY $768.00, AND THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE HOOD!! SO, YES, THEY KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM!! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO CAUSE THIS. IF I DID I WOULD TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT, BUT FORD SCREWED UP AND SHOULD FIX ALL OF IT AT THEIR EXPENSE.

NOW, ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE, I WAS DRIVING AROUND WITH NO PROBLEMS ON MY TIRES SO THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE I MUST HAVE PICKED UP SOMETHING ON MY WAY HOME LIKE A NAIL OR A SCREW. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST TIRE SHOP AND WHEN THEY INSPECTED THE TIRE THEY INDICATED THERE WAS A BULGE IN THE INNER EXTERIOR OF THE TIRE.  WHEN I ASKED THEM WHAT THAT MEANT THEY INFORMED ME THAT A BULGE USUALLY CREATED WHEN DRIVING THROUGH A POTHOLE.  I WAS INDICATED THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT POTHOLE TO CREATE SUCH A CONDITION ON A FAIRLY NEW TIRE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT I NEVER RAN OVER A POTHOLE. THE WHEELS DO NOT HAVE ANY BENDS OR SCRATCHES INDICATING IT WENT THROUGH A POTHOLE THE SIZE OF WHICH NEEDED TO BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE DAMAGE. THIS IS A NEW VEHICLE WITH ONLY 4,800 MILES AND FACTORY TIRES.  BECAUSE THE BULGE IS AT THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE, THE ONLY COURSE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION IS THE REPLACE THE TIRE.",

I  WAS CONTACTED BY A MARK JOHNSON YESTERDAY FROM FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE; , HE COULD NOT GIVE ME A DEFINITIVE ANSWER RE WHEN THE PARTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE  ALTHOUGH  CUSTOMER SERVICE HAD ADVISED THEY WERE AVAILABLE. HE ALSO TRIED TO DEFEND THE ONE DEALERSHIP'S POSITION THAT IT NEEDED TO SEE THE CAR FIRST TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FUEL OR VAPOR LEAK--EXCUSE ME BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE RECALL IS SO THAT THE CAR WON'T DEVELOP A FUEL OR VAPOR LEAK!!! HE SAID THAT  AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE SAFETY RECALL NOTICES ARE SENT OUT, AN EMAIL GOES TO ALL THE DEALERSHIPS ADVISING THEM OF RECALL AND THE PARTS NEEDED: REALLY?  THEN WHY  DID  NEITHER OF THE DEALERSHIPS I CONTACTED KNOW ABOUT THE RECALL?  THE RUN-AROUND I AM GETTING IS INEXCUSABLE: I LIVE IN A STATE WITH ELEVATED TEMPERATURES AND WHERE FRIENDS CAN LIVE LONG DISTANCES FROM EACH OTHER: I WANT THIS DEFECT FIXED--NOW.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. .",

I RENTED A 2015 MUSTANG WHILE ON VACATION IN JANUARY.  I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN MY KNEE HIT THE KEYS ( RENTAL CARS ALWAYS HAVE THE EXTRA KEYS AND INFO TAG MAKING IT BULKY ANYWAY ).  THE KEYS TURNED THE IGNITION TO ACCESSORY AND THE VEHICLE SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC AT 70 MPH.  AFTER THE NEWS REPORTS OF THE OTHER IGNITION RECALL THAT I HAVE SEEN ON ABC AND MY FIRST RESPONSE TRAINING, I STAYED CALM AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT INCIDENT.  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE FORD KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND SOMETHING IS DONE BEFORE ANYONE GETS HURT. I NOTIFIED THE RENTAL COMPANY OF THE ISSUE.

I FIGURED THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WITH THE TUNE I'M RUNNING SO I CALLED UP BAMA AND HAD THEM SEND ME A FRESH TUNE AFTER EXPLAINING WHAT HAD HAPPENED. ALSO, NOT SURE IF THIS HELPS OR IS RELEVANT INFORMATION BUT I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT 40 MIN BEFORE THAT AND DID A PULL ON THE HIGHWAY 2 MIN BEFORE THE CAR DIED.
