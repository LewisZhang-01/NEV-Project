The walls and camper slideout are supported by the cantilevered floor which begins to sag over time. The tire fenders are mounted to the walls which makes them lower down and begin to hit the tires. This begins to damage the tire and or rip the fendar off the trailer falling into traffic. The following years of trailers have six outright braces on each side welded and bolted to the frame to prevent this, showing that Forest River is aware of the design problem.",
