        "summary": "NEW 2014 CORNPRO 36' TRAILER WITH ELEC / HYD DOVE.  PURCHASED 9/11/13 AND PLACED IN SERVICE 10/02/13. HAULED APPROX. 7500 MI WITH LOAD AND 2500 MI EMPTY. WAS CRUISING AT 65 MPH HAVING CROSSED ONE OF MANY BRIDGES ON I-57 TOWARDS CHAMPAIGN, IL. WITHOUT NOTICE I HEARD A LOUD NOISE TO SEE SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. IMMEDIATELY I SLOWED AND PULLED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY THINKING MAYBE A HYD HOSE HAD BLOWN. BUT TO MY SURPRISE THE ENTIRE HYD DOVE TAIL HAD BROKEN OFF DROPPING THE 10' DOVE TO THE PAVEMENT WITH 2750\" OF PIPE STRAPPED PROPERLY ON THE BED. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS IF ONE OR THE OTHER HYD CYLINDERS WOULD HAVE BROKEN WHEN LOAD HIT THE PAVEMENT UPON LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE YOU COULD TELL THAT THE SIX INCH CHANNEL LOOKED AS IF IT WAS SPOT WELDED.  ONLY 7 INCH OF A 98 INCH SPAN WERE IN FACT WELDED. ALL INFO HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO CORNPRO. I HAVE GRAVE CONCERN FOR THE WELD PROCESS ON CORNPRO VS COMPETITIVE HYD DOVE GOOSENECK TRAILERS. CORNPRO NOW HAS MY TRAILER TO EVALUATE AND INFORM ME OF THEIR WARRANTY PROCEDURE.  *TR",
