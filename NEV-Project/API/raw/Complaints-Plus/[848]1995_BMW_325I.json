BECAUSE ALL FOUR TIRES FROM THAT SET DELAMINATED IN THE SAME PLACE AND IN THE SAME WAY AND AT THE SAME TIME I AM HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  THE COMPANY ALREADY HAS A TRACK RECORD OF FAILURE AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH PERSONNEL INDICATES COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY ISSUES, EVEN AFTER THE PREVIOUS PROBLEMS.  I AM CONCERNED THAT OTHERS WHO MAY NOT BE AS VIGILANT ABOUT TIRES COULD FALL VICTIM TO AUTO ACCIDENTS.  CAN SOMETHING BE DONE.  I WILL RETAIN THE TIRES FOR INSPECTION PENDING YOUR INTEREST IN THE ISSUE.  THANK YOU. (DOT NUMBER: DLF076  TIRESIZE: P215/60R15)",
