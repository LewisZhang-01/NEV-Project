IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS VEHICLE, AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SPRINGS WERE MANUFACTURED IMPROPERLY AND DO NOT RESIST CORROSION. FORD HAS RECOGNIZED THE PROBELM THROUGH SEVERAL TSBS AND EVEN HAD A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 03M02 WITH AT LEAST 2 SUPPLEMENTS CONCERNING THE ISSUE AND REPLACEMENT OF THE FAULTY PARTS. I SPOKE WITH A LOCAL FORD DEALER (HONDRU) AND THEY TOLD ME THE PROGRAM EXPIRED AND THE CAR IS NO LONGER COVERED. I THEN SPOKE WITH A FORD REPRESENTATIVE THROUGH DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY CONFIRMED THIS WAS THE CASE. THEY CONFIRMED THE CONVERSATION WITH NUMBER CAS4271469-Z6W0F2. THE REPRESENTATIVE'S NAME WAS KENDRA. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK TO ME AN MY FAMILY. THE COIL SPRING IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE SUSPENSION, AND WHEN IT BRAKES THE DRIVER'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THE CAR IS EXTREMELY COMPROMISED. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, THE BROKEN SPRING DESTROYS THE TIRE IMMEDIATELY, FURTHER REDUCING THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE CAR. SINCE IT WAS DOCUMENTED THAT THERE WAS A FAULT IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, AND FORD AND NHTSA KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, THESE PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED UNDER A RECALL DUE TO THE SAFETY CONCERNS.  *TT",

AFTER CALLING SEVERAL DEALERS, NONE OF THEM WOULD TELL ME ANYTHING, & THAT \"THEY DIDN'T RECALL ANY PROBLEMS BEFORE FROM ANYONE ELSE\". HOW IS IT THAT I CAN FIND THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET BUT THE DEALERS \"NEVER HEARD OF IT\"? WHY IS THERE NO CHANGE IN THE INDICATED ISSUE OF THE WIRING HARNESS TO THE REAR TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY? WOULDN'T THIS BE A HAZARD? I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WEREN'T WORKING UNTIL I GOT PULLED OVER BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO, THIS ISSUE HAPPENS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS BEING DRIVEN!!!

SUNDAY IT STOPPED KILLING. WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN MONDAY, I ASKED FOR THE SERVICE MANAGER, THE SERVICE EMPLOYEE  WENT TO FIND HIM & IT TOOK ABOUT 10 MINUTES, THAT WAS CURIOS AS THE PLACE WAS DESERTED.  WHEN THE SERVICE MANAGER ARRIVED, HE REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ONLY SAYING WE WERE BUSY. I HAD CONTACTED FORD AS WELL AS THE FRANCHISE HOLDER AUTO NATIONS PREVIOUSLY BUT NOTHING WAS DONE. LAST WEEK I SENT A LETTER TO  THE CHIEF ENGINEER AT FORD BUT I SUSPECT NOTHING WILL BE DONE AT THAT LEVEL AGAIN.    IN MY RESEARCH I FOUND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TODAY THAT WAS POSTED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL \" THE VEHICLE IS STALLING AT UNPREDICTABLE TIMES DUE TO FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM/FUEL PUMP. I AM A ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC. I TALKED TO FORD, THEN I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER. THEY TOLD ME, AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST IT'S A FUEL PUMP ISSUE...\"  THERE IS MORE TO THIS POSTING BUT THE BOTTOM LINE FORD KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM ALL ALONG AND CHOSE TO IGNORE IT.  THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN & IT COULD BE A KILLER.  *TR",

THAT BEGAN IMMEDIATELY, WITH THE INITIAL PURCHASE OF GAS - IN VISALIA; AND, IT WAS LATER CONFIRMED WAS CAUSED BY THE IMPROPER USE OF A TORCH ON A SUSPENSION CROSS MEMBER.    THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO ROB HOLBROOK'S AUTO CREW IN CLEARFIELD, UTAH, CHECKED FOR UNDERCARRIAGE DAMAGE AND EVIDENCE THAT CHARLON FORD'S REPAIRS CAUSED THE PROBLEMS. HE IS A LICENSED SAFETY INSPECTOR FOR THE STATE OF UTAH.     WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO THAT MAIN CROSS MEMBER, WHERE THE ATTACHMENT FOR THE REAR MOTOR MOUNT IS AFFIXED TO THAT PORTION OF THE SUB FRAME, WAS CONFIRMED.  THE SUB FRAME WAS QUITE DISTORTED, BOWED IN AND OUT, AND EXHIBITED EVIDENCE THAT THE MOUNT HAD BEEN REMOVED BY USE OF A TORCH SO THE REAR DOG BONE MOTOR MOUNT COULD BE REPLACED.     DEFORMATION OF THAT CROSS MEMBER AND RESULTANT CHANGES TO THE SUSPENSION WERE THE REASONS FOR LOW MPG AND TIRE WEAR BECAUSE OF IMPROPER CAMBER.    BILL WILCOX, STATED TO CALIFORNIA BAR THAT TOE-IN WAS ONLY ADJUSTED WHILE THE CAMBER WAS OVERLOOKED OR COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED. BUT, THE USE OF A TORCH TO THIS UNIT IS NOT CALLED FOR - UNLESS IT IS TO REPLACE THAT UNIT.        LEAVING THE SUSPENSION CROSS MEMBER IN THAT CONDITION, LEADS TO A STRESS POINT THAT COULD LEAD TO CRACKING AND TEARING, AND COULD PREMATURELY CAUSE RUSTING WHICH WEAKEN THOSE ATTACHMENTS TO THE SUSPENSION.   IF REPAIRS ARE MADE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IT AND SURROUNDING STRUCTURES BE RETURNED TO PROPER DIMENSIONS.  BUT PROBLEMS ARISE WHEN IMPROPER HEAT AFFECTS STRENGTH AND CREATES PERMANENT SOFTNESS AND INCREASING BRITTLENESS.

THE 3RD REGULATOR BROKE (FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE) ON 6/23/2010 ONLY THIS TIME, THE REGULATOR DIDN'T JUST FAIL AND STOP WORKING, THE WHOLE THING BURST INTO PIECES WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO ROLL THE WINDOW UP AND SHATTERED THE WINDOW WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  GLASS CAME RAINING DOWN INSIDE THE VEHICLE, LEAVING A MINOR CUT TO MY LEG (BECAUSE IT WAS VERY MINOR, I'M NOT CONSIDERING IT AN \"INJURY\" AND CHECKED THE \"NO\" FIELD BELOW).  FORTUNATELY, I WAS DRIVING IN A PARKING LOT WHEN IT HAPPENED SO LOW SPEEDS DIDN'T ALLOW THE GLASS TO BLOW AROUND BUT IF I HAD BEEN ON THE FREEWAY DOING HIGH SPEEDS, I COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY EXPERIENCED SEVERE CUTS FROM THE SHATTERING GLASS FLYING INTO MY VEHICLE.  THE FIRST TWO WINDOW REGULATORS THAT BROKE (BOTH REAR) HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED AS OF YET, I COULDN'T AFFORD THE PARTS (QUOTED AS $120 EACH AT THE TIME) SO VICE GRIPS ARE INSIDE THE DOOR HOLDING THE WINDOWS UP, BOTH FAULTY REGULATORS ARE STILL AVAILABLE.  THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE HAD NEW GLASS PLACED IN IT ON 6/24/2010 AND COST $146.00.  THEY DID NOT HAVE A REGULATOR AT THE REPAIR SHOP SO THAT WINDOW IS NOW ALSO BEING HELD UP BY OTHER MEANS AND THE FAULTY REGULATOR IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR THAT WINDOW AS WELL.

I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS ONLINE COMPLAINTS ABOUT REGULATORS BREAKING ON THIS MODEL VEHICLE SO IT APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM, BUT WHEN GLASS STARTS SHATTERING WHILE DRIVING, THAT SIGNIFICANTLY RAISES THE RISK/SAFETY FACTOR AND CAUSE FOR CONCERN. *TR",

I AM FURIOUS THAT FORD WOULD PROVIDE A 10YR EXTENDED WARRANTY ON IT'S VEHICLES - REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE, BUT WOULD EXCLUDE MODELS THAT HAVE VIN NUMBERS JUST OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF \"KNOWN OCCURRENCE OF PROBLEM\".  THE VEHICLE HAD STALLED ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY (US95 IN LAS VEGAS CLARK COUNTY), AND FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT.  THE VEHICLE HAD OVER $1300 OF SERVICE COMPLETED DURING THIS INCIDENT, BUT THE ISSUE HAS NOW RE-OCCURRED.  SYMPTOMS BEGAN IN LATE SEPTEMBER, AND HAVE GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING LONG DISTANCES, AS THE VEHICLE HAS BEGUN STALLING AROUND CORNERS AND DURING IDLING.  I CURRENTLY CAN NOT AFFORD PAYMENTS ON A NEW VEHICLE, AND WANT FORD TO HONOR ITS PLEDGE FOR SAFETY BY ADMITTING MORE VEHICLES UNDER ITS EXTENDED SERVICE WARRANTY.

I PUT THE CAR UP ON JACK STANDS AND INSPECTED THE SUSPENSION.  I FOUND THE DRIVERS SIDE SPRING WAS NOT SEATED ON THE STRUT BASE.  AT THIS TIME I DROVE THE CAR TO SEARS AUTO REPAIR IN NOVI, MICHIGAN.  WHILE DRIVING THE CAR TO SEARS THE SPRING MOVED A COUPLE TIMES, MADE SOME NOISE, AND AFFECTED THE STEERING OF THE VEHICLE.  SEARS INSPECTED THE SPRINGS AND FOUND THE DRIVERS SIDE SPRING WAS CORRODED AND FRACTURED IN A COUPLE PLACES AT THE TOP.  I ENDED UP REPLACING BOTH SPRINGS AND IT COST $436.86.    ON MONDAY (4/7/2008) I DECIDED TO GO ON THE INTERNET TO FIND OUT IF OTHER PEOPLE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE FORD FOCUS SPRINGS.  I FOUND OUT IT WAS NOT AN UNCOMMON ISSUE.  IN FACT FORD ISSUED A TSB (03M02S2) AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE SPRINGS TO 150,000 MILES OR 10 YEARS (ONLY IF SERVICED AT A DEALERSHIP).  UNFORTUNATELY I FOUND THIS OUT AFTER I REPAIRED THE CAR ON SUNDAY.  I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY FORD OF TSB ON THE SPRINGS. ALSO, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR USED (ABOUT 1.5 YEARS AGO) FROM A FORD DEALERSHIP WHICH SHOULD HAVE INSPECTED THE VEHICLE FOR THINGS LIKE THIS (SPRING CORROSION).     ON MONDAY (4/7/2008) I DECIDED TO CALL THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE (800-392-3673) TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO REIMBURSE MY EXPENSES AND DISCUSS THE SAFETY CONCERN.  I WAS TOLD BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT FORD DID NOT VIEW THIS AS A SAFETY CONCERN.  I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER DESIGNING SAFETY CRITICAL SUSPENSION COMPONENTS (NOT COIL SPRINGS) AND TO ME THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER.  IF THE COIL SPRING WERE TO FRACTURE FURTHER AND CUT MY TIRE WHEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY I CAN IMAGINE THAT WOULD NOT BE A VERY SAFE SITUATION.

REPEATED ALIGNMENTS WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. STILL EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM. STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH IT MISSING DURING ACCELERATION. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY REPLACED SENSORS THAT HAD RECALL,WAS RECALL CODE P0401. ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON. THEY SAID THAT WE WERE USING GAS THAT WAS DIRTY AND WAITING TOO LATE TO PUT GAS INTO THE CAR AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS STALLING. WE PAID $272.98 FOR THEM TO REPLACE THIS WHOLE SECTION THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE FUEL BEING FILTERED. CAR LOSES POWER AND STUTTERS GOING AROUND CURVES WITH EVEN OVER A HALF A TANK OF GAS. STALLING TO THE POINT WE MUST PULL OVER INTO THE EMERGENCY LANE AFRAID OF ACCIDENT! I OWN CAR I BOUGHT BRAND NEW AND IT JERKS AND SPUTTERS LIKE SOME PIECE OF CRAP FROM JD BYRIDER! EVERYTIME WE START THE CAR YOU SMELL OIL BURNING FOR15 MINUTES AFTERWARDS. HAD IT CHECKED NO LEAKS OR ANYTHING COULD BE FOUND. APRIL OF 2005 NOTICED WHEN THE CAR IDLED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT THE THERMOSTAT WOULD SHOW SHOOT UP SHOWING IT WAS RUNNING HOT! TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY FOUND ANTI-FREEZE LEAKING. WAS TOLD THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING AND THERMOSTAT HAD TO BE REPLACED. RETESTED IT AND WAS TOLD PROBLEM SOLVED. OUR BILL WAS $375.00.  THIS WAS FIRST BRAND NEW CAR AND WAS TAKEN WELL CARE OF, IT ONLY HAS AROUND 78,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A SILENT RECALL ON THESE FOR THE ENGINE PROBLEMS AND THEY WERE BEING FIXED FOR NO COST TO THE OWNER. WE WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF A RECALL AND PAID FOR ALL OF THIS OUT OF POCKET .CAR IS PAID OFF NOW AND CANNOT ENJOY HAVING A PAID OFF CAR WITH LOW MILEAGE BECAUSE WE ARE SCARED TO DRIVE IT AND BOUGHT A NEW CAR THAT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH OUR KIDS! TIME GOES ON AND IT IS GETTING WORSE. SOMETIMES NOT WANTING TO START AT ALL! ENGINE STILL STALLS DESPITE ALL THESE REPAIRS. *TR",

THE LADY WHO HELPED ME TOLD ME I NEED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE FUEL PUMP AND WAS CHARGED $590.43 FOR EVERYTHING INCLUDING FEES. AUGUST 1ST, 2007 A FRIEND HAD TOLD ME THAT A DEALERSHIP IN HIS AREA WAS REPLACING ALL FUEL PUMPS FOR FORD FOCUS 2001 THAT FAILED WITHIN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 7 YEARS UNDER 100,000 MILES AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT TELLING ANYONE UNTIL THE PART FAILED AND THEY BROUGHT IT IN FOR SERVICE. I LOOKED UP THE CLAIM ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT IT WAS TRUE. I GOT INFORMATION FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND COMPANY THAT MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE NUMBER , WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.  I STILL HAVE NO ANSWER AS TO WHY MY VEHICLE WAS NOT SELECTED WHEN MY CAR CLEARLY SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF THE DEFECTED FUEL PUMP.  THE ANSWER I RECEIVE WAS THAT IT COULD BE A VARIABLE OF REASONS INCLUDING WHERE IT WAS MADE AND WHERE THE PART WAS MADE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MY CAR HAS A 3YR WARRANTY AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD ASSIST ME WITH.  THE MORE I TRIED TO GET ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND THE CARS INVOLVED, WHO I CAN SPEAK TO OR WHAT CAN I DO TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE THE MORE THE REPRESENTATIVES GOT AGGRAVATED AND RUDE.

AFTER A FEW MONTHS, THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR WINDOW ALSO WOULD NOT SCROLL UP AND DOWN. I IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, THE PLASTIC REGULATOR. SO WHAT I DO IS TO PULL THE WINDOW UP AND HOLD IT TO THE FRAME USING A PIECE OF PAPER. TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WOULD COST ME $300 A PIECE. THAT IS $600 TOTAL TO PUT IN ANOTHER PLASTIC THAT WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, TODAY MY FRONT PASSENGERS SIDE WINDOW ALSO WENT DOWN. SAME PROBLEM. WHITE PLASTIC REGULATOR. THAT PUTS MY TOTAL COST OF FIXING THIS TO $1200. I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BUY A FORD AGAIN IF THIS PROBLEM CANNOT BE FIXED. THEY NEED TO RECALL THE FORD FOCUS EXHIBITING THIS PROBLEMS AND FIX IT. IT IS SIMPLE, STOP USING THE PLASTIC AS THE REGULATOR. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT YOU CAN'T PURCHASE THE REGULATOR ON ITS OWN. YOU HAVE TO BUY IT PLUS THE MOTOR WHICH I DO NOT NEED.

WE HAD A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A TANK OF GAS. THE ENGINE WAS NOT OVERHEATING. WE PROCEEDED TO DRIVE AT 35 MPH TO THE CLOSEST FORD DEALERSHIP WHICH WAS JACK KEY, IN DEEMING, NEW MEXICO. THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC, AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP AND FILTER. THEY WERE ABLE TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE, BUT WE HAD TO STAY IN TOWN OVERNIGHT. AFTER THE INCIDENT, I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT BAZAAR THAT A CAR LESS THAN TEN YEARS OF AGE WOULD LOOSE IT'S FUEL PUMP AND IT HAD JUST OVER 78,000 MILES ON THE CAR. I BEGAN TO DO SOME OF MY OWN RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED IN AUGUST OF 2001. IN JUNE OF 2001, THEY STARTED TO CHANGE THE FUEL PUMPS. SO ANY CAR MADE BEFORE JUNE WAS RECALLED, BUT HOWEVER, MINE WAS NOT SINCE THE CAR CAME OFF THE LINE IN AUGUST.

WHEN I TURN THE AC ON THE STALLING SEEMS WORSE. I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR 4 MONTHS AND HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED. BUT, NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIGURE IT OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CLOSE CALLS WITH ACCIDENTS.  *NM",

I HAVE REPLACED FUEL FILTER, SPARK PLUGS ETC ASSUMING THESE WERE THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM.  ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO, I WAS DRIVING ON I-90 IN NEW YORK STATE WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY STALLED WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT 65 MPH.  I WAS FORCED TO PULL OFF THE ROAD FROM THE PASSING LANE WITH A TRACTOR TRAILER BEHIND ME.  FORTUNATELY, THAT DRIVER WAS ABLE TO AVOID ME.  I WAS ABLE TO LIMP OFF THE ROAD AT AN EXIT ABOUT 1/4 MILE DOWN THE ROAD.  I FILLED THE CAR WITH GAS AND THE SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY.  THE CAR WAS BELOW 1/4 TANK OF GAS AT THE TIME.  I HAVE HAD ONE MORE EPISODE OF THIS PROBLEM A FEW MONTHS AGO ON ANOTHER TRIP (ALSO BELOW 1/4 TANK OF GAS).    I FILLED THE CAR WITH GAS AND CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS AT THAT TIME.  HOWEVER, THAT SITUATION DID NOT INVOLVE A NEAR MISS OF AN ACCIDENT.  IN MY RESEARCH OF THE PROBLEM, I DISCOVERED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FORD FOCUS VEHICLES.  MY CAR WAS MADE IN THE \"INTERIM PERIOD\" MENTIONED ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE.  I CONTACTED FORD'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE, BUT WAS TOLD MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN ALTHOUGH MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO BE IDENTICAL.  I TYPICALLY KEEP MY TANK FILLED EXCEPT ON LONGER TRIPS WHICH PROBABLY HID THE SYMPTOMS UP TO THIS TIME.  AT THIS POINT, IT APPEARS THAT THE FUEL PUMP WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.  *JB",

THE POTENTIAL FAILURE IS THE BACK SEAT BOTTOM (THE PART YOUR REAR END SITS ON) DOES NOT CATCH ON THE THREE LIP EDGES ATTACHED TO THE CAR BODY. THE METAL BASE OF THE BACK SEAT BOTTOM HAS THREE HOLES, ONE ON EACH SIDE AND ONE IN THE MIDDLE.  THEY CORRESPOND TO THE LIP EDGES FOR WHICH THEY DO NOT CATCH ON.  I SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THE ISSUE AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO GET IT FIXED THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE BACK SEAT ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED CONTAINING ALL THE CHILD SAFETY FEATURES AVAILABLE. WINDOW LOCKS, DOOR LOCKS, INTERIOR TRUNK RELEASE AND THE SAFETY SEAT LATCH SYSTEM.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT THE BACK SEAT DOES NOT CATCH ON THE LIP EDGES UNLESS IN AN ACCIDENT, THEN THEY SHOULD SLIDE FORWARD AND CATCH, AND THAT IS ONLY IF SOMEONE IS BUCKLED DOWN TO THE SEAT. WELL, NOW I HAVE AN INFANT DAUGHTER TO TRAVEL AROUND WITH IN MY BACK SEAT. THE GENERAL MANAGER GOT THE SAME ANSWER FROM A FORD CONTACT AS I DID FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER, SHOULD MY CAR BE HIT FROM BEHIND AND THE BACK SEAT IS EMPTY AND THE QUESTION IS DOES IT CATCH ON THE LIP EDGES OR NOT. I FEAR THAT IT WILL FLY FORWARD SLAMMING THE BACK OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS AND CRUSH OR PUSH ME INTO THE STEERING WHEEL OR THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE MAIN CONCERN I HAVE IS FOR THE SAFETY OF MY CHILD. I BELIEVE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD CATCH ON THE LIP EDGES AT ALL TIMES AND NOT JUST IN AN ACCIDENT. FORD TOLD THE GM THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A REPORT OF IT BEING A PROBLEM NOR DID IT EVER OCCUR IN A CRASH TEST. I TOLD THE GM TO GIVE IT TO ME IN WRITING SHOULD AN ACCIDENT EVER HAPPEN.

PROBLEM 2 - I HAD TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP (WHICH WAS EXPENSIVE).  I THINK THIS ISSUE HAPPENED DUE TO THIS STATEMENT I READ \"NHTSA INVESTIGATORS SAID THE ALLEGED ENGINE STALL PROBLEM MAY BE CAUSED BY DEBRIS ACCUMULATING IN THE GAS TANK, BLOCKING FUEL FROM BEING DELIVERED TO THE ENGINE.\"  EVENTUALLY, THIS \"DEBRIS\" PROBLEM CAUSES STRAIN ON THE FUEL PUMP.

THAT ISSUE MAYBE FROM THE MECHANIC WHO FIXED IT, BUT IF FORD WOULD HAVE PUT A RECALL FOR THAT ISSUE, I WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.    PROBLEM 3 -  I TOOK MY FOCUS INTO FORD TO GET A \"BUZZING\" SOUND CHECKED OUT.  THEY FIXED THE BEARING PROBLEM BECAUSE MY CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  NOW, 2 YEARS LATER, THE SOUND IS BACK.  I READ A STATEMENT \"...A REAR-WHEEL BEARING FAILURE THAT COULD LEAD TO A WHEEL FALLING OFF...\"  I AM AFRAID THAT THIS NOISE I HEAR TODAY IS DUE TO THAT SAME PROBLEM 2 YEARS AGO.

FIRST TWO \"REPAIRS\" (8/03 AND 12/03) WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, AND SUPPOSEDLY REPLACED THE IGNITION CYLINDER. I NEVER SAW THE OLD PART.   HOWEVER, WHEN VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN FOR SUBSEQUENT REPAIR TO THE SAME PROBLEM (2/04), I WAS TOLD THAT A PERMANENT REPAIR WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENT OF THE STEERING COLUMN AND WOULD COST ME $500+, BUT THAT THE IGNITION CYLINDER COULD BE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.  I GOT NO RESPONSE TO MY INQUIRY ABOUT WHY NO PERMANENT FIX HAD BEEN MADE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  I DIRECTED THEM TO PERFORM THE REPAIR I COULD AFFORD - THE CYLINDER.  I NEVER SAW THE OLD PART THAT TIME EITHER.  THE CAR WAS RE-KEYED AS WELL.  THE IGNITION LOCKED AGAIN ON 5/20/04, AND AFTER I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED ME THAT THEY HAD REPLACED THE TUMBLERS AND RE-KEYED THE VEHICLE AT NO CHARGE.  THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT ANY SUBSEQUENT REPAIRS WOULD BE AT MY EXPENSE, AS THEY WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY WARRANTY.  THE IGNITION LOCKED AGAIN ON 5/25/04.  *LA    THE INITIAL REPAIR TO THIS PROBLEM WAS MADE UNDER WARRANTY.  IT WAS NOT A PERMANENT REPAIR, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SERVICE BULLETINS AND A SIGNIFICANT RECORD OF COMPLAINTS ISSUED ON THIS SAME PROBLEM FROM EARLY 2001.  AT NO POINT HAVE I RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER, FROM THE DEALER OR FROM FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS, TO WHY THE PERMANENT REPAIR WAS NOT PERFORMED IN AUGUST 2003.  I FEEL THAT THE DEALER MADE NO ATTEMPT TO EFFECT A REPAIR ON THIS PROBLEM WHILE IT WAS WARRANTED, BUT STALLED WITH TEMPORARY FIXES UNTIL THE MILEAGE/AGE OF THE VEHICLE WOULD REQUIRE ME TO PAY, BOTH FOR PARTS AND LABOR.  AS IT NOW STANDS, I WILL BE TAKING MY VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALER FOR THE REPAIR AND A SECOND OPINION, AND HOPE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK.  I REFUSE TO PAY EVEN TEN CENTS FOR A REPAIR BY A SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY FAILED TO MAKE THE SAME REPAIR FOUR TIMES!",

NOW FOR THIS 170$ TICKET, 5 HOURS DRIVE FROM MY HOME IN MISSISSIPPI, WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO DEAL WITH THE LA POLICE? I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD TICKET GOODYEAR INSTEAD OF INNOCENT VICTIMS LIKE US, BUT 5 HOURS DRIVING TO COURT IS REALLY ANNOYING ESPECIALLY WE ARE STILL DRIVING A RENT CAR DURING THIS MOMENT. IS THERE ANYWHERE WE CAN DISCUSS THIS POLICE MANNER EXCEPT 5 HOURS DRIVING TO LA COURT?   FRUSTRATED CAR OWNER  LINGYUN JIN SUN.  *JB",

THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHARGE ME 75 BUCKS TO CHECK IT OUT (BECAUSE ACCORDING TO FORD, IT HAS TO BE DONE BY THEM REGARDLESS OF MY QUALIFICATIONS) THEN IF IT'S NOT HAVING THE PERFORMANCE PROBLEM AT THE TIME THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO VERIFY IT'S THE FUEL PUMP. SINCE IT'S INTERMITTENT I CHOSE TO PULL THE TANK AND INVESTIGATE MY SELF. I AGREE &#34;KINDA&#34; THAT IT'S A FUEL PUMP ISSUE. THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE I PULLED THE TANK TONIGHT, DISASSEMBLED THE PUMP/SENDING UNIT ASSEMBLY AND FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT IN THE BASE AND AROUND THE SIDES OF THE BODY THE PUMP SITS IN. ADDITIONALLY THE SCREEN/SOCK ON THE INLET SIDE OF THE PUMP MOTOR WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY CLOGGED WITH THE STUFF,. THE TANK ITSELF HAD A LIGHT FILM OF THE BROWN STUFF WHICH EASILY IS WIPED WITH A CLEAN RAG.  LOOKING AT THE GUNK, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE VERY BAD GAS, BUT WHY JUST THE FOCUS. I PUT THE SAME STUFF IN BOTH MY OTHER TWO VEHICLES AND NO PROBLEMS. I CAN'T ANALYZE THE STUFF TO DETERMINE WHAT IT IS FOR SURE BUT CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT CAUSED ENOUGH CAVITATION FOR THE PUMP TO HEAT UP BURN OUT. I DID NOT SEE EVIDENCE OF ANY GASKETS OR ANYTHING ELSE INTERNAL ATTACHED TO THE TANK GOING BAD, BUT SINCE I USE THE SAME FUEL ELSE WERE W/O PROBLEMS IT ALMOST HAS TO BE A SITUATION LIKE A SEALS/SEALANT DETERIORATING AND PRODUCING THE NASTY STUFF.  I PLAN ON SAVING $250 AND CLEAN IT ALL AND SEE IF THINGS IMPROVE. THE PUMP IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM FORD  (INTERESTING).    FORD NEEDS TO DO SOMTHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE THEY ALLOW SOMONE TO GET KILLED OUT THERE ON THE HIWAY.  I JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE USED A MONTH AGO FOR MY 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

AT THE END OF DECEMBER 2002, THE CAR WAS MAKING A STRANGE NOISE AND THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON, SO I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  A DAY OR SO BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD REGARDING THE PINCH BOLT.

IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM, LOOK AT THE TIP OF YOUR KEY -- IS IT BEING WORN DOWN AT THE TIP? THIS IS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM -- FORD BASICALLY USED INFERIOR METAL WHEN DESIGNING THEIR KEYS FOR THE 2000-2001 FORD FOCUSES. THEY HAVE SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THIS PROBLEM IN LATER MODELS. AFTER HAVING MY IGNITION CYLINDER REPLACED OR REBUILT THREE TIMES, FINALLY AFTER THE FOURTH TIME, THEY GAVE ME A NEW SET OF KEYS. BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AND IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE MY CURRENT \"NEW\" KEY GETS WORN DOWN ENOUGH TO LOCK UP THE IGNITION SWITCH WHEN I INSERT IT.  I AM IN THE MIDST OF PURSUING THE LEMON LAW ON MY CAR. I'VE ASKED FORD TO \"REPURCHASE\" MY CAR AND THEY HAVE COUNTERED MY OFFER TO \"REPLACE\" MY CAR WITH ANOTHER FOCUS -- FULLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE \"IGNITION CYLINDER MALFUNCTION... WAS A KNOWN CONCERN IN 2001 MODELS, AND WAS UNFORTUNATELY UNABLE TO BE REPAIRED ON YOUR VEHICLE.\"   THIS PROBLEM HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING RECALL-WORTHY (IN MY OPINION) BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW TO GET THAT PROCESS ROLLING! ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT ALL FOUR SEPARATE TOW TRUCK OPERATORS(WITHOUT BEING ASKED BY MYSELF) TOLD ME THAT THEY TOW 12-15 FORD FOCUSES A MONTH WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM! THAT'S RIDICULOUS!  I WAS TOLD BY A KIND FORD SERVICE GUY THAT IF I EVER DO GET IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHERE MY IGNITION SWITCH LOCKS UP AND MY KEY WILL NOT TURN AND START MY CAR, THAT IF I LIGHTLY TAP THE END OF THE KEY INTO THE IGNITION SWITCH WITH SOMETHING HARD -- IT MAY WORK TO ALLOW IT TO TURN. SO IF YOU ARE IN A PICKLE, GIVE THIS A TRY.  IF YOUR CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BE SURE TO KEEP A GOOD RECORD OF EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS TO YOU.

THE CAR WOULD SPIT AND SPUTTER FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT WOULD CLEAR UP AND BE FINE.   THIS USUALLY OCCURRED WHEN ACCELERATING ON AN INTERSTATE ON RAMP AND WAS (AND STILL IS) POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.    THE SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF THE CAR STALLING GRADUALLY BECAME WORSE OVER A FEW MONTHS TIME.  NOW THE CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 46,000 MILES ON IT.  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2003 WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE TRAVELING AT 65 MPH WITH 1/2 TANK OF GAS THE CAR STARTED GOING THROUGH FUEL STARVATION.  IT LAST A FEW SECONDS AND THEN CLEARED UP.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.  BEFORE THE LAST INCIDENT, I THOUGHT THAT IF I MADE SURE THE GAS TANK WAS NOT LOW THE CAR WOULD BE OKAY.    I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THIS INCIDENT AFTER THE LAST INCIDENT.  I SEARCHED THE NHTSA SITE AND FOCALJET.  I SAW THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING THIS PROBLEM AND LEARNED WHAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS.  I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS THE LINING OF THE GAS TANK COMING LOOSE AND KEEPING THE FUEL DELIVERY MODULE FROM TAKING UP AS MUCH GAS AS THE CAR NEEDS TO KEEP RUNNING.    I CONTACTED THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP ON NOVEMBER 11, 2003.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME HE HAD HEARD OF THE PROBLEM, BUT HAD NEVER HAD A CUSTOMER THAT HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT.

PUSHING IN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL DOES NOT MAKE THE RPMS GO UP.  THE CAR RUNS VERY ROUGH FOR SEVERAL SECONDS (SPITTING AND SPUTTERING IS HOW I DESCRIBE IT) AND THEN CLEARS OUT.  *LA",

WE HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR 18 MONTHS AND TOOK THE CAR TO THE LAIRD NOLLER DEALERSHIP IN LAWRENCE FOR THE 30,000 CHECK UP WITH 33,000 MILES ON THE CAR.  AFTER SPENDING $300 FOR THE CHECK UP, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH TWO MECHANICS AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE ROTORS SHOULD NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED ON A CAR THAT IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY ON THE HIGHWAY SINCE THERE IS NOT A LOT OF STOP AND GO DRIVING.  THERE A DOZENS OF LISTINGS ON THE INTERT AND THE NHTSA WEBSITE OF THE SAME COMPLAINT ON THEIR FORD FOCUS VEHICLES.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT FORD PUTS THIN ROTORS ON THE FOCUS TO BEGIN WITH SO THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED VERY EARLY.  I WAS ALSO LEARNED FROM AN EMPLOYEE AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE PERSON THAT PERFORMED THE SERVICE ON OUR FOCUS HAS HAD TROUBLE MEETING HIS QUOTA OF UPSELLING REPAIRS ON CARS THAT COME IN FOR THEIR CHECK UP.  AFTER PICKING UP THE CAR, THE ENTIRE DASHBOARD WAS SHAKING AND THE FRONT TIRES WERE MAKING NOISES.  WHEN WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN IT WAS FINE , AFTER WE PICKED IT UP IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE.  WE CALLED BACK UP TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WERE TOLD TO DRIVE IT FOR A FEW DAYS AND IT SHOULD BE FINE.  AFTER WAITING THE TWO DAYS, THE BRAKE PADS BEGAN TO GRIND INTO THE ROTORS AND THE CAR DID NOT DRIVE WELL AT ALL.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH FORD AND WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR ME AND THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS.  FORD KNOWS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ROTARS THEY ARE USING ON THE FOCUS, BUT IS NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I AM WORRIED THAT ARE NOT OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR THAT MAY MAKE IT UNSAFE.  I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND AM WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING THEM AROUND IN THE CAR.  I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I HAVE SEEN, FORD SHOULD BE TOLD TO INITIATE A RECALL ON THE ROTARS.",

DURING 12/01,  BIG \"O\" TIRE COMPANY DID AN ALIGNMENT CHECK AND TIRE ROTATION, BUT DIDN'T NOTICE THE TIRE PROBLEM. I LEFT ON A SHORT TRIP AFTERWARDS. THE REAR TIRES THAT HAD BEEN MOVED FORWARD, CHATTERED LOUDLY, ESPECIALLY, THE LEFT SIDE BUT DIDN'T BEFORE ROTATION.  THE INSPECTION SHOWED THE LEFT FRONT TIRE THAT HAD BEEN ROTATED FROM THE REAR HAD SERIOUS TREAD WEAR DAMAGE, CUPPING, AND FLAT SPOTS, SOME HIGH AND LOW. THE LEFT FRONT THAT HAD BEEN ROTATED TO THE REAR WAS ALSO DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR. THE TIRE CO. FELT THEY HAD MISSED SOMETHING DURING ALIGNMENT AND ROTATION, SO THEY PAID FOR ONE OF MY FIRESTONE TIRES AND I PAID FOR THE OTHER TO BE REPLACED WITH NEW FULDA TIRES. FIRESTONE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN MUCH CREDIT DO TO ODD WEARING PATTERNS. ALSO, THE RIGHT TIRES HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BUT NOT NEARLY AS BAD. I CONTACTED THE FORD DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY SAID CONTACT THE TIRE MANUFACTURER, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. YET, NOTHING IS WRONG WITH MY FOCUS BUT ON 12/11/01 THEY REPLACED MY REAR WHEEL AXLE BEARINGS DUE TO A RECALL . FORD CHECKED THE ALIGNMENT AND SAID THE TIRES (FIRESTONE) MUST BE DEFECTIVE AND I BELIEVED THAT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE REPLACED THE REAR TIRES WERE TOO. THE NEW TIRES MADE THE VEHICLE MORE STABLE AND EASIER TO CONTROL. THE FIRESTONE TIRES REPLACED WERE BADLY WORN AND I THOUGHT THEY CAUSED THE CAR TO SHIMMY FROM SIDE TO SIDE DURING  RAIN OR SNOW AS IT WAS HARD TO CONTROL AND MAKING ME AFRAID TO DRIVE. IN 3/02, THE LAST TWO FIRESTONES WERE REPLACED WITH THE FULDA TIRES. I THOUGHT THE TIRE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. AS OF AUGUST 2002, THE NEW REAR FULDAS' ARE DOING THE SAME THING.

THE CAR STARTED TO STALL AND I HIT THE CURB (RIGHT TIRE/WHEEL HIT THE CURB), BOTH AIRBAGS WENT OFF (WHY????) AND BURNED MY ARM (REALLY BAD) AND BROKE THE WINDSHIELD.    I DID NOT REPORT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I FOUND OUT THAT GEICO (INSURANCE COMPANY) HAD LOST (OR NOT RECEIVED) MY ONLINE APPLICATION SO I HAD NO COVERAGE AND THEREFORE I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL THE REPAIRS MYSELF.   NEW WINDSHIELD, AIRBAG, WHEEL... COST $3000+ I'M STILL PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS.     THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED WHEN I STOPPED ON RED LIGHT (I JUST THOGHT I WAS RUNNING OUT OF GAS...), THEN;  YESTERDAY 06/28/02 I WAS DRIVING HOME ON HWY 192 AT APPROX. 45MPH AND THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER (NO WARNING) , I GOT SCARED AND HIT THE BRAKES AND PULLED OVER ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT IN THE INTERSECTION.  IT'S BEEN RAINING HERE IN FL ALMOST EVERYDAY, I AM GLAD THE ROAD WAS NOT WET WHEN IT HAPPENED... IT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH WORSE.     MY CAR IS A 2001 FORD FOCUS ZX3 WITH ONLY 7500 MILES, SO IT'S NOT AN OLD CAR.    AFTER SOME QUICK RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A WHILE NOW... AND MANY OF MY FOCALJET.COM (ONLINE FORD FOCUS CLUB) FRIENDS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.   SO, I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE READING THIS;  WHEN WILL YOU (AND/OR FORD) DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?    I'VE JUST FOUND OUT THAT I AM PAYING ($3000+, AND I ONLY MAKE MIN. WAGE) FOR AND SMALL ACCIDENT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED...    SORRY, I AM REALLY UPSET, I ALMOST CAUSED A HIGH-SPEED/MULTIPLE-CAR ACCIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF HWY 192  AND I AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN HURT.    PLEASE HELP ! ! !*AK",

PERIODICALLY I WOULD BE DRIVING ALONG AND THE CAR WOULD ACT AS THOUGH THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AT PHIL LONG THAT I SPOKE WITH AT THIS TIME WENT WITH ME FOR A TEST DRIVE IN THIS CAR AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  HE SAID NOTHING COULD BE DONE UNLESS THEY COULD EXPERIENCE WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE CAR.  I TOLD HIM THE CAR WAS SLIPPING, SKIPPING, AND TWICE WHILE DRIVING ALONG THE CAR LOST POWER.  HE TOLD ME WHAT I HAD SAID DID NOT MAKE SENSE AND UNLESS THEY COULD EXPERIENCE THIS MALFUNCTION THEY COULD ONLY GUESS IT WAS ONE OF THE COMPUTERS IN THE CAR ADJUSTING FOR A ROAD CONDITION.  THIS SERVICE REP DISMISSED ME AS BEING A STUPID WOMAN.  TODAY, DECEMBER 31, 2001, I WENT TO MY CAR AT 7:00AM THIS MORING TO GO TO WORK AND WHEN I TOUCHED THE GAS PEDAL IT WENT RIGHT TO THE FLOOR AND WOULD NOT COME BACK UP.  I MANAGED DRIVING AT 2MPH TO PHIL LONG FORD WHERE I SAT FOR 2 1/2 HOURS BEFORE THEY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR IS A BROKEN CABLE.  I AM SO FURIOUS WITH PHIL LONG FORD I FILED A COMPLAINT VIA E-MAIL WITH FORD MOTOR CO.  AS I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THIS SITUATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY I REALIZED HOW FORTUNATE I WAS THAT THE CABLE BROKE WHILE I WAS SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT WHERE I LIVE.  SUPPOSE THIS HAD (AND IT PROBABLY HAS TO OTHERS) OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ALONG.  SUPPOSE THIS HAD HAPPENED ONE OF THE TWO TIMES THIS CAR LOST POWER AS I WAS DRIVING ALONG A VERY BUSY ROAD?  I WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I THINK FORD SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY LOSING AT LEAST ONE VACATION DAY FOR WORK POSSIBLY TWO OR MORE DAYS BECAUSE PHIL LONG CAN NOT GIVE ME ANY GUARANTEE WHEN THIS CAR WILL BE FIXED BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAY.

MY CAR WAS ONLY 3 FEET FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT HIT ME AND THE BACKING CAR BACKED UP SLOWLY AND ONLY CAUSING A SMALL SCRACH ON THE BUMPER. AFTER THE 2 CARS BUMPED, MY CAR BEGAN TO ROLL AND CONTINUED TO ROLL DOWN A SLOW GRADE AND PICKED UP SPEED. THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR ATEMPTED TO STOP MY CAR BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO GET IN SENCE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED. HE ALSO ATEMPTED TO GET THE FRONT TIRES TO TURN AND COULD NOT. MY CAR THEN STRUCK A STAND OF TREES DISTORYING THE REAR END. MY CAR ROLLED OVER 120 FEET FROM THE SPOT IT WAS PARKED IN. WHEN I GOT INTO MY CAR, I CHECKED THE SHIFTER TO SEE IF IT HAD BEEN MOVED OUT OF \"PARK\"  IT WAS STILL IN \"PARK\" AND I SHOOK IT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS. I THEN STARTED THE CAR WITH OUT ANY PROBLEM AND MOVED IT  BACK TO WERE IT WAS PARKED. THE CAR DROVE AND ACTED FINE, I EVEN HAD 2 OTHER PEOPLE ROCK THE CAR TO SEE IF WE COULD GET IT TO JUMP OUT OF GEAR AND IT WOULD NOT. I THEN CALLED A FORD DEAL WHERE I WAS TOLD \"THATS NOT A PROBLEM, IF YOUR CAR GETS HIT IT CAN JUMP OUT OF PARK\". BEING A POLICE OFFICER MY SELF FOR OVER 18 YEARS AND IN THAT TIME WITH ALL THE ACCDENTS I HAVE SEE I HAVE YET TO SEE ONE WHERE A CAR WITH A AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WAS HIT AND CAUSE IT TO COME OUT OF \"PARK\" EVEN WHEN IT WAS HIT AT OVER 50 MILES AN HOUR. MY CAR WAS HIT AT LESS THAN 1 MILE AN HOUR AND IT JUMPS OUT OF GEAR? BUT I REALLY CAN'T SAY IT JUMPED OUT OF GEAR SENCE IT WAS STILL IN PARK THE HOLE TIME IT WAS ROLLING DOWN HILL AND WAS FOUND IN \"PARK\" AFTER IT CAME TO A STOP. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM AND I THANK GOD MY CAR WAS NOT PARKED WHERE IT COULD OF ROLLED OUT INTO A MAJOR INTERSECTION AND CAUSE THE DEATH OF ONE OF MINE OR SOMEONE ELSES FAMILY MEMBER. *AK",
