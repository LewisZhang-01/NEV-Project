This is a 2002 Dodge Ram with the 9.25\" rear axle and they appear to still have issues to this day with that axle model.  The recall Dodge had in 2009/10 does not even begin to cover the number of Dodge Ram/Dakota vehicles with this issue.  The axle in this vehicle was replaced in 2009 for another issue with an axle retainer clip falling off and causing the internal assembly to grind on the boss for the axle.  So as the original owner, and with only 137,140 miles on the vehicle in 19 years, it has had multiple problems fixed under warranty, including total axle replacement and now it will have rebuilt again.    There should be a real safety concern for all Dodge pickups with the 9.25\" rear axle and a recall for every one of them, not just 2009/10.  This has been happening for 20 years.  When will NHTSA step up and hold Dodge to task for this issue. Regards, [XXX] Minden, NV  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

THE ONLY REASON THEY PURCHASED THE TRUCKS WERE THAT DODGE PROVIDED THE LOW BID AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A GOVERNMENT RECALL ON THE STEERING AND THEIR PRACTICE IS TO ACCEPT THE LOW BID. THE POWER STEERING. TIE RODS AND SUSPENSION ARE MAJOR COMPONENTS TO GOING DOWN THE ROAD SAFELY. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE SOMEONE DYING TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.

CHEVY TRUCKS, FORD TRUCKS AND TOYOTA TRUCKS DO NOT HAVE THE REPUTATION FOR HAVE ISSUES WITH THE FRONT END AND STEERING COMPONENTS. THUS THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A DEFECT ISOLATED TO THE DODGE RAM TRUCKS. SINCE YOU CANNOT REQUIRE AND INDIVIDUAL TO REPLACE THE RACK AND PINION THEMSELVES EVERY 50,000 MILES THE ONLY OPTION WOULD BE TO REQUIRE DODGE TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.     THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTIONS. *TR",

BEFORE HE SOLD IT TO ME HE MENTIONED THAT THE AIR BLOWER FOR THE AIR CONDITIONING AND HEATER DOESN'T WORK.  HE SAID IT WAS A RECALL THAT HE NEVER TOOK IN TO  GET SERVICED.  SO I LOOKED THE TRUCK UP ON THE WEBSITE WWW.RECALLS.GOV. AND SURE ENOUGH THERE IT WAS.  A RECALL ON THE STEERING COLUMN ELECTRICAL CONNECT.  NOW I REMEMBER RIDING WITH MY FATHER IN LAW AND HE WOULD BE CONSTANTLY MOVING THE STEERING WHEEL UP AND DOWN USING THE TILT WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING WOULD CUT OFF AND THAT MADE IT TURN BACK ON.  THE PROBLEM IS IS WHEN I GET ON THE DODGE SITE AND SEARCH FOR RECALLS USING THE VIN NUMBER THIS RECALL DOESN'T SHOW UP.  I CALLED A DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT DIDN'T SHOW UP EITHER.  I FIND IT A LITTLE ODD THAT MY TRUCK DOESN'T SHOW THIS RECALL IS NEEDED WHEN IT IS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THIS STEERING COLUMN ELECTRICAL CONNECT IS THE VERY ISSUE I'M HAVING.  AND I RECALL THAT MY FATHER IN LAW HAS HAD THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME MAYBE NOT LONG AFTER HE BOUGHT THE TRUCK NEW.  I THINK MY TRUCK SHOULD BE HONORED THIS RECALL SERVICE BEINGS IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.     *JS",

I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY FROM THE \"FACTORY\" COATING INSIDE THE OIL PAN HAD DELAMINATED AND WAS SUCKED INTO THE PICKUP TUBE. THE COATING THEN PLUGGED THE SCREEN AND PICKUP TUBE. I CALLED DODGE CARES AND THEY TRIED TO BLAME ME THEN THE OIL.

THIS BOX IS NOT AIR TIGHT AND ALLOWS WATER TO GET INSIDE AND CORRODE THE INSIDES. DODGE DEALER ADVISED THEY REPLACE THE FUSE AND RELAY CENTER AND FCM (FRONT CONTROL MODULE) TOGETHER. THE FCM IS CONNECTED TO THE IPM (INTEGRATED POWER MODULE). COME TO FIND OUT THE IPM IS NOT SEALED FROM THE ELEMENTS. THE CIRCUIT BOARD IS EXPOSED FROM THE BOTTOM WHICH ALLOWS WATER TO SPLASH INTO THE MODULE THEREBY SHORTING THE FCM. I BELIEVED DODGE KNOWS THIS IS A POOR DESIGN AND IS UNSAFE BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS HAVE BEEN REDESIGNED WHICH IS SEALED FROM THE ELEMENTS. THIS IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF OBVIOUS REASONS. I BELIEVE THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BECAUSE THE WIRING SYSTEM PROBLEMS RESULT IN LOSS OF LIGHTING. FOR IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THIS WAY.

I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER HOW THIS CAN NOT BE A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW THAT NEARLY KILLED ME, MY DAUGHTER AND THE POOR GUY IN THE ONCOMING LANE. ONLY CORRECTION AVAILABLE IS NEW ENGINE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE DUE TO EXCESSIVE COSTS, THEREFORE TRUCK NOW SITS. I AM A WELL ROUNDED DRIVER WITH LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN MOST VEHICLES, LARGE TRUCKS AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND CAN HANDLE SITUATIONS BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE. IT TAKES A LOT TO PUT FEAR IN MY HEART AND THIS REALLY SCARED ME. *TR",

THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS VIA INTERNET ETC OF THIS PROBLEM AND THAT DODGE WILL NOT BUDGE TO FIX THE PROBLEM THAT THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF OCCURING.THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR ESTIMATES ARE ANYWHERE FROM $250 TO OVER A $1000 DOLLARS JUST TO REPLACE THE DEFECT.AND ALSO THAT DODGE HAS A BACK ORDER OF THESE BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THEM. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GO OUT WITHOUT NOTICE OR A BULB OUT LIGHT BEING SIGNALLED THEEBY CAUSING ANOTHER VEHICLE TO REAREND OR SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE WITHOUT THESE LIGHTS AT NIGHT.

I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED CHRYSLER, WHO ALSO DECLINED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH THEY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME NATURE CONCERNING 1999 AND UP DODGE RAM'S.  IN JUST 6 MONTHS, THE HAIRLINE CRACK HAS NOT ONLY GOTTEN LARGER, BUT NOW THE DASH HAS 4 MORE CRACKS IN VARIOUS OTHER LOCATIONS.  ONE LOCATION THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME IS THE ONE ABOVE THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG.  I HAVE SINCE TAKEN MY TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM OF MY CONCERN AND THAT I FEEL THIS IS NOW A SAFETY ISSUE.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE CRACKS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND BECOME MORE FREQUENT UNTIL THE DASH CRACKS IN HALF.   *JB",

ON 20 APR 2006, MY 2002 DODGE RAM 1500 PICK-UP WITH 50,529 MILES STARTED STALLING AFTER THE ENGINE WARMED UP.  THERE WAS A DISTINCT \"PINGING\" SOUND COMING FROM THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BEFORE THE ENGINE WOULD STALL.  MY 17 YEAR OLD SON WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND WAS RETURNING FROM SOCCER PRACTICE WHEN THIS FIRST STARTED.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK--THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT BASED ON MY DESCRIPTION FELT THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER MIGHT BE BAD, SO THEY REPLACED IT.  THIS SEEMED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM UNTIL A MONTH AND 1,100 MILES LATER THE VERY SAME SYMPTOMS AROSE (ENGINE STALLING WHEN WARMED UP, AND A \"PINGING\" SOUND COMING FROM THE VICINITY OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  THIS TIME THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS BEING SCORED PISTONS, REQUIRING ME TO REPLACE MY ENGINE BLOCK...AT 51,679 MILES!  A QUALITY ENGINE WOULD NOT FAIL AT THIS LOW MILEAGE.  I CALLED DODGE, THEY AGREED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED'AND WERE VERY APOLOGETIC THAT MY WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, BUT THEY REFUSED TO SHARE THE BURDEN OF THE NEARLY $7,000 COST WITH ME, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS ONLY 51,679 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.

I WAS TOLD, IF THE ALIGNMENT DID NOT HELP TO BRING IT BACK AND THEY WOULD ORDER/INSTAL A NEW RACK. I DID SO AND WAS PUT OFF. TODAY, 5-30-03 I RETURNED TO THE DEALER TO ASK ABOUT THE FIX FOR MY STEERING PROBLEM. I AGAIN WAS PUT OFF AND I ASKED TO CALL CHRYSLER. I DID, THE NICE AND EFFICIENT LADY NEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE STEERING PROBLEM. I ASKED IF THERE WERE ALOT OF COMPLAINTS LIKE MINE AND WITHOUT SAYING \"YES\", SHE INDICATED THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS. WHILE ON HOLD WITH HER, SHE CALLED MY DEALER.

PROMISES UPON PROMISES HAVE BEEN MADE TO RE-FLASH THE COMPUTER SYSTEM BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD THEY (DODGE) THINK THE TRUCKS COMPUTER SYSTEM IS TELLING THE TRUCK TO SHUT DOWN.  ONE TIME WHILE RIDING DOWN THE ROAD THE TRUCK LOST COMPLETE POWER TO ALL INTERIOR SYSTEMS (I.E. AIR CONDITION, STEREO, WINDOWS) AND WE HAD TO PULL OVER.  THE TRUCK HAS STALLED BOTH IN REVERSE AND IN DRIVE, THE TRANSMISSION HAS LOCKED UP ON THE DEALERSHIP (IN REVERSE).  FROM FEB. 28, 02 TO JUNE 28, 02 THE TRUCK WAS IN THE SHOP OVER 25 DAYS.  ON JULY 8, 2002, THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR COMPLETELY BROKE AND WOULD SPIN AROUND IN CIRCLES.  WHEN WE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WE WERE TOLD IT WAS ON A NATIONAL BACKORDER.  WHILE WAITING FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR, THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR BROKE IN THE SAME FASHION.  ALL IN ALL WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL 9/9/02 TO HAVE THE MIRRORS FIXED.  WHILE WAITING WE HAD TO TAPE THE MIRRORS IN PLACE SO WE COULD SEE WHILE DRIVING.  THIS WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AT TIMES AND MADE IT DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL.

THE DESIGN OF THE MIRROR AS WELL AS THE COMPONENTS INSIDE ARE FAULTY. THERE IS A SHAFT INSIDE THE MIRROR CASE THAT HOLDS THE MIRROR STATIONARY BY THE TENSION HELD BY A COIL SPRING ON THE HOUSING. THE NORMAL PURPOSE OF THIS MECHANISM IS TO ALLOW THE MIRROR TO FOLD IN OR OUT WHEN THE MIRROR STRIKES A FIXED OBJECT, SAVING THE MIRROR FROM BEING BROKEN. IN THIS FAULTY ASSEMBLY, THE RETAINER CLIP WHICH HOLDS THE COIL SPRING AND MIRROR HOUSING IN PLACE FAILS, ALLOWING THE MIRROR TO SWING TOWARD THE FENDER WHEN SLOWING OR TOWARD THE DOOR WINDOW WHEN SPEEDING UP. NOT ONLY DOES THIS RENDER THE MIRROR USELESS, IT ALSO INCREASES THE CHANCES OF HAVING AN ACCIDENT FORM NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING BEHIND THE VEHICLE WHEN BACKING OR ANYTHING TO THE SIDE WHEN SWITCHING LANES. THE MIRROR COULD POSSIBLE COME OFF THE SHAFT COMPLETELY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND BY BECOMING A PROJECTILE ON THE HIGHWAY. THE MIRROR COULD ALSO HIT THE DOOR GLASS CAUSING IT TO SHATTER. REPLACEMENT MIRRORS ARE ON BACK ORDER ACCORDING TO THE DEALER AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MIRRORS THAT HAVE FAILED. BOTH THE MECHANICS AT THE DELEARSHIPS AND CHRYSLER KNOW ABOUT THE DEFECT. THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE MIRRORS REPLACED IS AFTER THEY ACTUALLY FAIL. AFTER THE PASSANGER SIDE MIRROR FAILED, I HAD IT REPLACED AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR UNLESS IT ACTUALLY FAILED. A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER, IT FAILED AS WELL, LEAVING ME IN VERY HEAVY TRAFFIC WITHOUT A DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR.I BELIEVE CHRYSLER SHOULD RECALL ALL VEHICLES WITH THE DEFECTIVE MIRRORS AND REPLACE THE PAIR TO GET THIS DANGER OFF THE STREET",

ABOUT TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAST CAR WASH, THE MIRRORS WERE FOLDED OUT LIKE NORMAL.  I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 10-15 MILES AN HOUR IN NO WIND AND THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR BEGAN TO \"FLOP\" BACK AND FORTH.  I LOOKED AT IT AND COULD LIFT UP ON IT APPROXIMATELY ONE INCH.

I TOLD HER YES AND SHE STATED THAT I WOULD BE THE FIFTH 2002 RAM SHE HAS SEEN WITH THAT PROBLEM IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS.  I TOOK MY TRUCK IN FOR THE APPOINT MENT THE NEXT WEEK. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD LOST THE NEW MIRROR AND DID NOT HAVE ANY MORE.  THEY EXPALINED THAT ANOTHER WOULD BE IN ON 7/5/2002.  I CALLED ON 7/6/2002 AND MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT FOR 7/15/2002 TO GET THE MIRROR FIXED.  ON 7/12/2002, I FOLDED THE MIRRORS FOR YET ANOTHER CAR WASH. I RETURNED THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR BACK TO ITS POSITION.  THE NEXT MORNING I PULLED OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR STARTED \"FLOPPING\" AROUND EXACTLY THE WAY THE PASSENGER SIDE HAS BEEN.  I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE BOTH OF MY MIRRORS HAVE BROKEN AND AFTER WHAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME ABOUT OTHER VEHICLES, THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.

WHILE JACKING THE REAR WHEEL ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USER MANUAL, THE JACK SLIPS EASILY BECAUSE A) IT HAS A SMALL FOOTPRINT THAT REMAINS IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUND, AND B) THE EXTENTIONS USED TO TURN THE CRANKING MECHANISM ON THE JACK ARE WOBBLY, WHICH CAN CAUSE THE JACK TO MOVE WHILE RAISING AND LOWERING.
