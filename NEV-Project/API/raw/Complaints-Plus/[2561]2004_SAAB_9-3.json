I HAVE TALKED TO MY CERTIFIED SERVICE CENTER AND THEY SUGGESTED I REACH OUT TO YOU BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ISSUE ME A WRITTEN APPROVAL TO AUTHORIZE THEM TO DISCONNECT THE AIR BAG TO REMOVE THE RISKS.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT IN THE PAST THEY HAVE RECEIVED REQUESTS TO DISCONNECT PASSENGER AIRBAGS WHEN SOMEONE NEEDED TO USE A CAR SEAT AND THEY DID NOT WANT THE AIRBAG TO EXPLODE ON IMPACT.  THIS IS A SIMILAR SITUATION, WHERE I DO NOT WANT THE AIRBAG TO EXPLODE ON IMPACT DUE TO A DEFECTIVE PART.      SINCE YOU ARE UNABLE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY, AND I NEED TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR, I CANNOT BE DRIVING A CAR THAT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATH IF I WERE TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT.  THEREFORE, THE ONLY OPTION IS TO DISCONNECT THE HAZARD SO THE CAR CAN STILL BE SAFELY DRIVEN.  THE SEATBELT IS IN PLACE, ALONG WITH SIDE AIRBAGS FOR SAFETY.

I HAD IT TOWED TO THE LOCAL SAAB DEALERSHIP IN ORLANDO, FL WHERE I WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO PURCHASE A SPEED SENSOR.  THIS WAS DONE AND THE COST WAS APPROXIMATELY $515.00.  THE DAY AFTER THE REPAIR, I NOTICED THE CAR CONTINUED TO HAVE ROUGH AND INAPPROPRIATE SHIFTING.  I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL SAAB DEALERSHIP IN DUBLIN, OH WHERE A DIAGNOSTIC WAS PERFORMED.  THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS CHANGED AND THE TRANSMISSION REPROGRAMMED.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS, 'MILKY AND DARK IN APPEARANCE.'  THEY SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE THE CAR, DRIVE IT FOR 2 WEEKS AND BRING IT BACK TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  AFTER DRIVING THE CAR FOR 2 WEEKS I RETURNED IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO FIND OUT THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST FOR THIS IS $7000.00.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THE COUPLINGS HAD GONE BAD AND CAUSED COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THESE SAME COUPLINGS WERE RECALLED BY SAAB IN 2003-2004.  HOWEVER, BY VIN NUMBER, MY VEHICLE DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE DATES OF THE RECALL.  THE RADIATOR AND COUPLINGS WERE MANUFACTURED DURING THAT RECALL PERIOD AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DEFECTIVE PARTS.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP TO CONTACT GM/SAAB TO TRY AND OBTAIN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  I HAVE BEEN IN THAT PROCESS FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH NOW.  ORIGINALLY, THEY OFFERED TO PAY 25% TOWARDS PARTS AND LABOR FOR THE NEW TRANSMISSION (ADMITTING GUILT) WHICH WOULD DECREASE THE COST FOR ME TO $5000.00.

I HAD TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ACCIDENT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF MY SEERING WHEEL LOCKING UP.  THIS HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING DOWN A HILL. BEFORE THE PHYSICAL LOCK-UP OF THE STEERING WHEEL I DEPRESS MY CLUTCH GETTING READY TO ENGAGE A GEAR COMING OUT OF NEUTRAL, THE ENGINE MAGICALLY DIES (THE RPM?S DROP FROM IDLE SPEED TO ZERO, THEY KEY IS IN THE ?ON? POSITION AND THE CAR IS MOVING), WITHOUT ANY NOTICE THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS UP AS IF THE KEY WAS REMOVED, ALL WHILE I?M ATTEMPTING TO NAVIGATE WINDING DOWNHILL TURNS.  I COULDN?T TURN THE STEERING WHEEL SO I REACTED QUICKLY BY GETTING ON THE BRAKES AND SLOWING THE VEHICLE WHILE TURNING THE KEY OFF THEN ON AGAIN TO RELEASE THE LOCKED STEERING WHEEL SO THAT I COULD STEER THE VEHICLE.  *AK",
