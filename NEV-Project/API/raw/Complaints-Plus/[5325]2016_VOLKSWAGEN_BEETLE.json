I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM TONY VOLKSWAGEN ON OAHU ISLAND IN HAWAII. I LIVE ON THE ISLAND OF KAUAI IN HAWAII, WHERE THERE IS NO VOLKSWAGEN DEALER AND NO CERTIFIED VOLKSWAGEN REPAIR TECHNICIAN. FOR A PREVIOUS RECALL, THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE CAR SHIPPED BACK TO OAHU TO TAKE CARE OF THE RECALL ISSUE. I CONTACTEDTONY VOLKSWAGEN SERVICE MANAGER DAMEN DUPREE IN NOVEMBER 2019 REGARDING THIS CURRENT RECALL AND AT THE TIME HE SAID THAT BECAUSE THIS RECALL INVOLVED SUCH A SMALL REPLACEMENT PART, IT WOULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR THEM TO SEND A TECHNICIAN OVER TO KAUAI INSTEAD OF PAYING TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SHIPPED TO OAHU. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS TURNED THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN SINCE MARCH, BUT I BEGAN THIS PROCESS WAY BEFORE THAT WAS AN ISSUE. THERE IS CURRENTLY A 14 DAY QUARANTINE FRO TRAVELERS FROM OAHU TO THE OTHER HAWAIIAN ISLANDS, SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IT NO LONGER MAKES SENSE TO SEND SOMEONE OVER FROM OAHU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS RECALL ISSUE. IT SEEMS AS IF THEY SIMPLY ARE TRYING TO AVOID THE COST OF SHIPPING MY VEHICLE OVER TO OAHU TO CHECK OUT THE RECALL ISSUE. I HAVE CALLED MR. DUPREE AT LEAST 10 TIMES TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED, AND HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A RETURN CALL FROM HIM SINCE OUR FIRST CONVERSATION BACK IN NOVEMBER, 10 MONTHS AGO. SO FAR, I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS THAT THE RECALL IS CONCERNED ABOUT, BUT I WANT TO KNOW MY CAR IS SAFE AND COULD NOT RESULT IN A CRASH THAT COULD INJURE PEOPLE AND DAMAGE PROPERTY, AS STATED IN THE LETTER I RECEIVED. I NEED TO KNOW MY CAR IS COMPLIANT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN GIVE ME REGARDING GETTING THIS RECALL ISSUE RESOLVED.",
