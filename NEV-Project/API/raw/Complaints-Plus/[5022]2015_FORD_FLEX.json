The only warning light was a wrench on the display.  All electrical power remained on but there was no engine power and no acceleration.    We were fortunate there was a shoulder where I was able to pull over.  I coasted the car down the exit and onto a street away from traffic.  I waited about 10 minutes, turned the car off and turned it back on and it started.  The wrench light on the display was off.    I called the local Ford Dealership and the Service Advisor said there were no recalls and that I would need to pay for a diagnostic check.  The issue has not reoccurred.",
