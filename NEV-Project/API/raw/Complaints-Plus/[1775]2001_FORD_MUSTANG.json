I HAVE BEEN TO MANY MESSAGE BOARDS ON MUSTANG WEBSITES AND HAVE FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A LOCAL DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT.

MY OPINION IS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS CAR THAT FORD NEEDS TO ADDRESS BUT WILL NOT DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS THEIR #1 VEHICLE AND RECALL COSTS WOULD BE TO MUCH.   *JB",

THEN TOOK IT AND SHOWED IT TO THE FORD DEALER SWANSON FORD IN LOS GATOS, CALIFORNIA.  THE DEALER WAS RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE BREAK PAD WAS SPLIT APART, HE HAS INSISTENT ON IT WAS PAD WEAR.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE FORD DEALER TECHNICIAN, IT IS VISUAL AND VERY NOTICEABLE THAT THE BREAK PAD HAS SPLIT APART FROM ITS METAL BASE, IT WAS NOT A WEAR OUT DOWN TO THE METAL BASE.  THIS IS UNSAFE AND MAY CAUSE UNNECESSARY ACCIDENTS.  THE SAME PROBLEM MAY HAPPEN TO OTHER DRIVERS TOO.  THIS IS WHY I AM INSISTING ON A FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE TO GET BACK TO ME IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

THE CAR HAS BEEN REPAIRED IN THE PAST YEAR OVER 9 TIMES FOR THE VIBRATION! SO THERE WAS A PRECEDENT ALREADY SET BEFORE THE FORD REP. GOT INVOLVED. MY CONCERN IS THAT I STILL HAVE A VEHICLE THAT HAS ANABNORMAL VIBRATION WHILE TRAVELING BETWEEN 65-75MPH ON HIGHWAY, IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED BY ME, THE DEALERSHIP,AND FORD. THE VIBRATION KEEPS COMING BACK AND I HAVEBEEN TOLD BY REPUTABLE SOURCES THAT IT COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF ABNORMAL WEAR THAT CAN HAPPEN TO MY TIRES FROM THIS ABNORMAL VIBRATION I TOLD THIS TO FORD, MANY MONTHS AGO, SO THEY SWITCHED MY TIRES, INCLUDING THE BRAND(FROM GOODYEAR TO MICHELLINS)WHEN THE FORD REP. WAS ASKED THE QUESTION BY ME HOW IS IT THAT TH DEALER'S SHOP FOREMAN FELT THE ABNORMAL VIBRATION AND HE DIDN'T, HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT IT ALL ENDED WITH HIM NO MATTER WHO FOUND WHAT!!!THIS PROBABLY SEEMS VERY CONVOLUDED BUT I AM JUST EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO MY SAFETY ,AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF MY FELLOW CONSUMERS.

I WAITED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING TO DRIVE THE CAR, AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID THE CATALYTIC SENSOR WAS ACTING UP AND THEY WOULD TURN THE LIGHT OFF AND THAT SHOULD FIX IT. HOWEVER, IF THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, I WAS TO BRING THE CAR BACK. I HAD TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK A TOTAL OF THREE TIMES, DUE TO THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT. I WAS TOLD AFTER THE SECOND REPLACEMENT OF A SENSOR IN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTOR, THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN GIVEN BAD GAS BEFORE I HAD PURCHASED IT, CAUSING THEM, THE SERVICE REPAIRMEN, TO HAVE TO COMPLETELY TAKE APART THE FUEL SYSTEM AND CLEAN IT FROM ENGINE TO EXHAUST. THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED UNTIL AFTER THEY COMPLETELY REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTOR. INFORMATION WAS WITHHELD CONCERNING REPAIR TO THE VEHICLE BEFORE I PURCHASED IT. THE REPLACEMENT WAS FINALLY COMPLETED BY APRIL 15TH, 2001. MY NEXT PROBLEM OCCURED ON JULY 13TH, 2001. I WAS RETURNING FROM A TRIP TO COLORADO WITH MY FATHER, WHEN AS WE WERE TRAVELING, I HEARD A LOUD POP AND THEN FELT WATER HIT MY FOOT. I HAD BEEN RIDING ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AT THE TIME. WHEN I NOTICED THE WATER, I LOOKED TOWARD THE FLOORBOARD AND ALSO FOUND THAT THE DASHBOARD HAD SHIFTED TO THE LEFT AND FALLEN FROM THE WINDOW. WE ARRIVED AT HOME LATER THAT DAY AND I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT IN AND DO A COMPLETE ONCE OVER TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE LEAKING. I TOOK IT IN ON JULY 17TH. I WAS TOLD THEY HAD FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DASH OR COULD NOT FIND A LEAK. I HAVE TAKEN IT BACK A TOTAL OF 6 TIMES THUS FAR FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND THREE FOR THE FRONT END. *AK",
