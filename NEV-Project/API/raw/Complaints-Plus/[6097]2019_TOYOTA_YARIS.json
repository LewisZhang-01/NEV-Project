When the vehicle would start, the transmission would hesitate upon the depression of the accelerator pedal with several unknown warning lights illuminated. Upon investigation underneath the hood, the contact discovered sticks and chewed wiring which he linked to squirrels. Since the initial discovery, the contact had seen squirrels entering and leaving the engine compartment on two separate occasions. The dealer had been notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The manufacturer was also notified of the failure and provided a case number. The contact ordered the parts to replace the wiring harness and air filter cover however, the vehicle was not yet repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 14,700.",
