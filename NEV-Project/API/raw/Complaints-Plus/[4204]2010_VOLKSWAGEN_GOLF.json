I HAD READ ABOUT HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP (HPFP) PROBLEMS WITH THESE CARS AND TOLD THEM TO CHECK IT OUT.  THEY CALLED THE NEXT DAY AND SAID THE PUMP WAS FINE BUT THAT THEY WERE STILL INVESTIGATING.  TWO MORE DAYS LATER THEY SAID THE HPFP WAS BAD DUE TO CONTAMINATED FUEL AND IT NEEDED $8,000 IN REPAIRS.  THEY SAID THEY TRIED TO BURN A SAMPLE OF THE FUEL AND IT BURNED, AND THEY SAID THAT DIESEL WON'T BURN, SO THEREFORE THEY SAID THERE WAS GAS IN THE TANK.  THEY TOLD ME TO CALL MY INSURANCE SINCE IT WASN'T COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  I CALLED THE CHEVRON STATION WHERE I BOUGHT THE FUEL, AND TO MY AMAZEMENT THEY TALKED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTOR WHO AGREED TO PAY THE CHARGES.  I FEEL VERY LUCKY.

THIS VEHICLE HAS VERY LONG CLUTCH TRAVEL BUT AN EXTREMELY SHORT ENGAGEMENT.  CAR NOTORIOUSLY STALLS VERY EASILY BECAUSE OF THIS.

SECONDLY, DUE TO THE STALLING OF THE ENGINE, THE NEXT INFERIOR DESIGN ISSUE IS THAT VW IGNITIONS REQUIRE YOU TO COMPLETELY MANUALLY CYCLE OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH (AS WHEN THE CAR IS STALLED) THEN RECYCLE THE IGNITION SWITCH TO RESTART THE MOTOR.  THEREFORE, WHEN YOU STALL THE CAR, AS EASILY AS IT HAPPENS, SUCH AS MOVING OUT INTO AN INTERSECTION FROM A STOP SIGN, YOU MUST RAPIDLY TURN IGNITION SWITCH COUNTER CLOCKWISE, FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY CLOCKWISE TO RESTART THE ENGINE.

WHEN IT REGAINS POWER THERE IS A HUGE PLUME OF WHITE SMOKE OUT THE TAIL PIPE THAT QUICKLY DISSIPATES, LEADING ME TO BELIEVE FUEL OR WATER.

CAR NOW HAS 15K MILES AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ABOUT 6-10 TIMES OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS.  DEALERSHIP MECHANICS CLAIM THEY CAN NOT REPLICATE OR FIND ANY ERROR CODES PLUS CLAIMING THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS TYPE OF COMPLAINT, ALSO THEY CLAIM/SUGGEST THIS COULD BE A POOR FUEL ISSUE, SUGGESTING GOING TO ANOTHER GAS STATION.  SALESPERSON WHO SOLD ME CAR INFORMED ME, OFF THE RECORD, THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT AND THEIR IS SAFETY CAMPAIGN CURRENTLY GOING ON WITH THE 2009 JETTA TDI, BUT CLEARLY THIS IS THE SAME ENGINE AS THE '09.  THIS TYPE OF COMPLAINT IS ALSO ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND FOUND IN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THE 2009 JETTA TDI ON THIS SAME WEBSITE, THEREFORE IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE A COVER-UP WHEN THE MECHANICS TELL ME THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS LIKE THIS???  AS A VETERAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, THIS IS A VERY MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.  *TR",
