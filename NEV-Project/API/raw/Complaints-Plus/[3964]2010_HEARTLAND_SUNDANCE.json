        "summary": "DURING THE ANNUAL SERVICE OF MY 2010 HEARTLAND TRAVEL TRAILER THE SERVICE FACILITY DISCOVERED THAT THREE OF THE FOUR WHEELS ON MY CAMPER HAD SEVERE CRACKS.  THE SERVICE FACILITY CONTACTED HEARTLAND AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT HEARTLAND DID NOT HAVE A RECALL FOR THE WHEELS.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THREE OF THE FOUR WHEELS THAT CAME WITH MY TRAILER (WHICH I BOUGHT NEW) HAD SEVERE CRACKS, IT IS A VERY GOOD INDICATION THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THEM.  I BELIEVE THAT IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE WHEELS FAILED WHILE I WAS TOWING MY TRAILER THE RESULTING WRECK WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER.  I THINK THAT THESE WHEELS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE  THEY CAUSE A HIGHWAY CATASTROPHE.  I HAVE ALL FOUR WHEELS AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION.    *JS",
