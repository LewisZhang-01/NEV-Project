IN THE END, AS YOU WILL SEE IN THIS DESCRIPTION, THIS WAS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE IN REGARDS TO A VEHICLE.  AFTER AROUND 7,000-9,000 MILES ( I WOULD HAVE TO PULL THE PAPERWORK AS I AM AT WORK NOW) THE CAR OVER-HEATED ON THE FREEWAY AND DURING THE OVERHEATING THE CAR SHUT DOWN FORCING ME TO LOSE POWER STEERING AND THE CAR BEGAN TO DRIFT LEFT IN TO THE OTHER LANE.  I PUMPED THE CLUTCH SEVERAL TIMES AND SUCCESSFULLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR RUNNING JUST FAR ENOUGH TO PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND CALL A TOW TRUCK.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE SINCE TRAFFIC WAS MOVING AROUND 65-70 MPH.  THE CAR WAS SENT TO FRITTS FORD IN RIVERSIDE, CA AND I FOUND OUT THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE RADIATOR CAP CRACKED AS WELL AS THE RADIATOR BUT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER (I KNOW MY SPELLING IS WRONG HERE) NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR SOME REASON.  I BELIEVE THEY SAID IT HAD A HOLE IN IT WHICH I CAN'T BELIEVE AFTER ONLY 7K-9K MILES.  I ALSO BELIEVE THEY REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT.    IT WAS TOO LONG AFTER I RECEIVED THE CAR BACK (ABOUT 3K-5K MILES) THAT THE OVERHEATING HAPPENED AGAIN, THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN, ETC AND I WAS FORCED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND AGAIN LUCKILY WAS NOT HIT BY ANOTHER CAR.  THE CAR WAS BACK AT THE DEALER AND THE RADIATOR AND THERMOSTAT WERE REPLACED I BELIEVE.  SINCE THEN I HAVE MOVED TO TEXAS AND THE SAME THING HAS OCCURRED THREE TIMES IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS.  EACH TIME (WELL THE FIRST TWO SINCE THE LAST ONE JUST HAPPENED LAST NIGHT) I WAS TOLD THE THERMOSTAT WAS BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I GUARANTEE NOW THAT THE CAR IS AT BOB TOMES FORD IN MCKINNEY TEXAS FOR THE 3RD TIME WITH ONLY 22,000 TOTAL MILES THAT THE THERMOSTAT WAS BAD AGAIN AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    *NM",

STALLING CAN OCCUR WHEN THESE SEQUENCES IN ORDER ARE FOLLOWED WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE IN MOTION.  IF DRIVING INTO AN INTERSECTION, THIS CAN POSE RISK DUE TO LOST VEHICLE POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKE SYSTEMS IF THE ENGINE HAS STALLED.  THE POWER BRAKES ON MY 2003 FORD MUSTANG SVT COBRA ARE BOOSTED BY THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM'S PUMP WHICH IS DRIVEN BY THE ROTATING ENGINE, THE BRAKES ON MY 2003 FORD MUSTANG SVT COBRA ARE NOT POWER ASSISTED BY THE ENGINE'S INTAKE VACUUM WHICH IS VERY COMMON WITH DOMESTIC VEHICLES.  WITH A VACUUM POWER ASSIST DESIGN, POWER ASSIST CAN STILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE HAS JUST STALLED.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THE ENGINE DRIVEN POWER STEERING PUMP STOPS TURNING WHEN THE ENGINE STOPS TURNING (IE HAS STALLED) ON MY 2003 FORD MUSTANG SVT COBRA, POWER ASSIST TO THE DRIVER TO PUSH ONTO THE BRAKE PEDAL IS LOST AND THEREFORE THE FORCE NEEDED TO PUSH DOWN ONTO THE BRAKE PEDAL IN ORDER TO SLOW THE CAR IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE.  THIS CAN BE A PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERT ENOUGH FORCE ONTO THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP THE CAR IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES NEEDED IN AN INTERSECTION, SHOULD THE ENGINE STALL.  ALSO, OF COURSE, THE POWER STEERING ASSIST TO THE DRIVER IN ORDER TO EASILY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOST.  FORD SHOULD FIGURE OUT WHY THE ENGINE STALLS WHILE THE CAR'S IN MOTION DURING THESE CONDITIONS AND PUT FORWARD AN EFFORT TO FIX IT.  THANK YOU.  JOE.*AK",
