THE INFORMATION CENTER WILL DISPLAY THE MESSAGES: \"STABILITY CONTROL DISABLED\", \"ENGINE POWER REDUCED\". AND THE VEHICLE WILL NOT GO OVER 20 MPH ON A LEVEL SURFACE AND BEARLY 3 MPH UP A MODERATELY STEEP HILL. EACH TIME I HAVE HAD IT INTO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR THEY HAVE BEEEN STUMPED BY WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS.
