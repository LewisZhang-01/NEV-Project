I HAVE OWNED THE SAME BRAND IN OTHER RVS PREVIOUSLY THROUGH THE YEARS BECAUSE I BELIEVED IN THE MANUFACTURED BRAND. THE SUSPENSION IS WELL KNOWN AS A \"FLEETWOOD ROCKER\" INSTEAD OF A FLEETWOOD BOUNDER BY ALL THE MOTORHOME DEALERS THAT CARRY OTHER FRAMES AND CHASSIS. THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW THE PROBLEMS WITH IT BEING DEALERS AND NOT ENGINEERS. I REPLACED THE SHOCKS TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM ONLY TO FIND OUT THE SHOCKS WERE NOT BAD, THEY ARE UNDERSIZED FOR THE COACH BEING TOO TOP HEAVY , AND THE CANTILEVERED COACH WEIGHT THAT IS REAR TO THE AXLES. THE SAME PROBLEM LIES WITH THE SUSPENSION ON SWAY AND STEERING PROBLEMS. THERE ARE NO TRACKING OR STEERING CONTROLS ON THE FRAME TO COUNTERBALANCE THE ADDED WEIGHT OF A COACH ON A FORD WORKHORSE CHASSIS. A STABILIZER ON THE FRONT DOES NOT HELP DUE AGAIN TO BEING TOP HEAVY AND ALL THE WEIGHT REAR OF THE BACK AXLE. THIS COACH SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO BE BUILT ON THAT PARTICULAR FRAME OR CHASSIS WITH THAT MUCH REAR AXLE TAG WEIGHT, WITHOUT ADDED CONTROLS FRONT AND BACK TO STABILIZE THE SUSPENSION AND STEERING OR AT LEAST LENGTHENED WHEEL BASE.  BRAKES ARE SAME ISSUE, UNDER SIZED AND CAUSED SEVERE HEATING PROBLEMS TO THE POINT THAT A DESIGN CHANGE HAS SINCE BEEN MADE. THANKS TO SOMEBODY, I JUST WISH THE SUSPENSION AND STEERING WOULD GET THE SAME ATTENTION BY THEM ACCEPTING OWNERSHIP OF THEIR MISTAKE OR BEFORE A FATALITY OCCURS.        *JS",
