WE WENT TO OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALER - HONDA WORLD IN WESTMINSTER, CA.  THE PARTS HAD TO BE ORDERED.  AS OF TODAY, SATURDAY APRIL 11 WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE DEALER ABOUT RECEIVING THESE PARTS AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE REPAIRS.  I WENT ONLINE TO HONDA AND FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS RECALL AND THE PART MALFUNCTION HAS CAUSED SOME DEATHS.  HONDA'S INFORMATION ONLINE ALSO STATED WE COULD GET A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE IF THE PARTS NEEDED TO BE ORDERED.  WE WERE NEVER OFFERED THIS.  WE NEED THIS VEHICLE AND CANNOT GO WITHOUT A CAR.  *TR",

THE RESOLUTION HONDA RECOMMENDS DOES NOT REMEDIATE THIS FAILURE. HONDA RECOMMENDS BURNISHING THE STARTER CLUTCH AND CHANGING THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. INDEPENDENT MECHANICS RECOMMEND REPLACING THE STARTER CLUTCH AND BEARINGS WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COSTLY. IT WOULD SEEM THAT HONDA EQUIPPED THESE VEHICLES WITH A SUBSTANDARD TRANSMISSION UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE.

THE STARTER CLUTCH NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, A MORE EXTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE REPAIR, BUT THE ONLY REPAIR THAT FIXES THE PROBLEM FOR GOOD.  HONDA HAS A KNOWN DEFECT, AND THEY HAVE USED A BAND-AID APPROACH TO THE REPAIR; FORCING CUSTOMERS TO BURNISH THE TRANSMISSION BEFORE THEY WILL REPLACE THE STARTER CLUTCH.  CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD BY BURNISHING AND THEN HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE PROBLEM TO RE-OCCUR.
