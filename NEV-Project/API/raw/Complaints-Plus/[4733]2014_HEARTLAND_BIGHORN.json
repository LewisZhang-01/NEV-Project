TIRE PRESSURE (80 PSI) AND LUG TORQUE (120 FT/LB) CHECKED BEFORE DEPARTURE. EXITED I-26 IN LEXINGTON SC AND HAD DRIVEN 2-3 MILES, SPEEDS 35 AND UNDER, ON SURFACE STREET WHEN LEFT REAR TIRE BLEW, SEPARATING 2/3 OF THE TREAD CIRCUMFERENCE CREATING A 3 1/2 FOOT LONG 8 INCH WIDE STEEL BELTED FLAIL THAT DESTROYED THE LOWER VALANCE AND WHEEL WELL ON LEFT MAIN SLIDE, THROWING DEBRIS ON ADJACENT TRAFFIC. THANKFULLY, DUE TO LOW SPEED AT TIME (20-25), THERE WERE NO INJURIES, DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES OR LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL. TRAILER PURCHASED NEW JAN 2014 AND HAD LESS THAN 1500 MILES TOTAL USE. INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED LOTS OF SIMILAR STORIES AND A FULL COMPLAINT LOG (50) SINCE 6/2014 ON NHTSA SITE. NO FAITH IN THESE TIRES; REPLACED TWO (ALL THE LOCAL GOODYEAR TIRE DEALER HAD ON A SUNDAY) BUT WILL REPLACE THEM ALL WHEN AVAILABLE. HEARTLAND AND TBC, THE TIRE MAKER (?) WILL HEAR AS WELL. SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD!  *TR",
