I expressed concerns over electrical damage, damage to the air bags, and possible mold growth in the vehicle and was told that Toyota doesn't consider water leaking into an airbag/control panel to be an issue.

Asked if possibly the sensors need to be recalibrated after rotations, dealership said no the vehicle is suppose to relearn the new location.   One morning my front tire said it was low, added air and rechecked it with a handheld PSI reader. Also visually checked it for nails or defects. Tire appeared fine so I got in to drive home. It was the rear tire that blew on the interstate driving home not the front left which was the one that was telling me was low. I did look at the rear while getting in the vehicle. It didn\u2019t appear low visually but it was dark at the time and was reading just fine through the Toyota\u2019s PSI monitoring system. Also didn\u2019t drive any different. Typically you can tell if your tire is low or flat by how it drives. You usually can hear a thumping too. Thought maybe the cold weather was just telling me it\u2019s low, cold weather causes tire air to contract dropping PSI but it will stabilize later. Thought maybe it was that or possibly the sensor was bad in it. All I knew was I checked it and made sure the PSI was at the factories recommended amount. Turns out all 4 tires were reading on the wrong location. Which I didn\u2019t know at the time. Caused my vehicle to hit the side of the bridge from fish tailing. Which resulted in damage to the rear arm that needed to be replaced and significant suspension damage. Totaling 3K+ in repairs.   Toyota opened an investigation but has been dragging their feet on the issue. And don\u2019t want to take responsibility nor tell me why my tires are reading in the wrong locations. They stated that I should have checked all the tires PSI by hand because back in the day they didn\u2019t have monitoring systems that told you the exact tire that was low. But if you are going to integrate a monitoring system, it should work properly. If it doesn\u2019t then it shouldn\u2019t be used with the public at all. How is the customer suppose to know that your system is unreliable.",

Luckily I did not get into an accident but this was completely startling and I could have easily gotten into an accident or had glass injure myself or passengers (luckily no one else was in the car). I brought the car into a local Toyota dealership in Colorado and they mentioned that someone who had about the same mileage on their car (17,000-18,000) miles came into that same dealership a few weeks ago with the exact same issue. They told me that Toyota would not consider this a defect or under warranty if it happened after 1,000 miles. I also sent a follow-up email to a service manager at the same dealership and he said that they have seen this before and a field technical specialist has looked into it and determined that it could not be a defect if it happened after 1,000 miles.

I do drive my car daily and car not sat in garage more than 2 days!  On evening of July 24th I wan\u2019t able to turn on the vehicle. It was totally dead. Had to request road assistance for jump then took  the car to Toyota Sunnyvale for check. They mentioned the issue was the battery and then having hard time with them to replace it with a new one. They Assured and Confirmed with me couple of times on the phone and at the Service Center this issue will never ever happen again. I was told it was a software issue that was consuming the battery and company fixed the software and they updated on my car and it won\u2019t  happen again for sure.  Morning of November 16th while was heading to work same story repeated again. Faced with a totally dead vehicle, called again for road assistance for a jump and car is now sitting at Toyota Sunnyvale Service Center for analysis.  I cannot trust to Toyota Service Centers any more and now I cannot relay on my vehicle. I look forward for a reasonable response from Toyota Motor Corporation.  Why customer has to face with dead battery, ask roadside assistance and visit the dealership to identify the problem? What if I was out of town or in situations that cannot get roadside assistance? Why if this software issue it was not  software recall and customers was not informed? Why this issue happened twice? What guarantees this will never happen again?",

        "summary": "My name is [XXX]. My wife, myself, our 2 month old baby and our dog were driving back from a family vacation when our moon roof spontaneously exploded outward. It was an extremely loud noise and then sounded like it was raining glass. Our baby started screaming and crying from the noise. We were able to immediately and safely pull off the freeway to examine the vehicle. Upon inspection we noticed the remaining glass on the edges of the moon roof looked as if it were being pulled upwards. We are very lucky the screen was shut and nobody got hurt. The incident occurred on a sunny & clear, early afternoon while we were on the freeway going 55mph, there were no cars in front of us or beside us for more than a half mile, we were not near or passing under a bridge or an overpass. There were no warning lights or other symptoms before the incident happened, as well as no warning lights after the fact. There was absolutely no reason this should have happened or anything that we did to cause it or to stop it from happening. I took photos of the damage immediately after and it shows the remaining glass lifting outward. I did some online searching and found that this has happened to multiple other drivers with this exact make & model of vehicle, as well as multiple other years.  I brought our car into Toyota within an hour of the incident occurring. One of their employees working said that she has heard of this happening before. I see this as a recurring incident with this model of car and it is extremely dangerous. We bought this vehicle with only 5k miles on it, less than 3 months ago from a Toyota dealership. We bought this car because we have a new baby and wanted a safe family vehicle. We are now terrified that this will happen again. We never would have imagined that anything like this would happened in the first place. From my recent research I am shocked that this vehicle issue has not been recalled.

I am shocked that Toyota does not care. I think you should check into this.

The problem is that this is an intermittent issue and hard to get to dealer during time of concern, and while they could troubleshoot the issue before the issue fixes itself.   The concern ALWAYS happens upon starting vehicle.  Never happens when you are already going and issue is not present.  Steering wheel will pull right, or left, upon start up, and then at some point it fixes itself and problem is no longer an issue.  Could happen at any time upon start up, cold or hot weather, fresh start, or going back out after having been on road already, just no rhyme or reason for it.    The safety issue is that when turning, when it is pulling, is that it pulls you towards the curb/shoulder, or towards oncoming traffic.  Additionally, it will also not return the wheel after a turn, so if it was pulling left, and you are turning left for example, you have to manually get that wheel back or it'll just keep going left.    I've experimented with turning off lane keep assist, lane centering (cruise control), put it in different modes like trail, sport, etc. and even stopped on the shoulder, and tried to re-start the vehicle.  Nothing can stop it consistently.  And it fixes itself within a 10 minute period.  I have checked the AWD monitor screen to see if a wheel is pulling harder than the others based on the display of power going to wheels, no luck.   It has been doing this since day one.  Not every trip.  Not even every week.  Sometimes it could happen 5x in a week, and sometimes it could be 2 weeks before it happens again and then again in another couple of weeks.  Not the road either.  Must be paying attention when starting out because it could happen on any trip, during a trip if stopping and re-starting vehicle while on a trip, etc. because it can/will pull you.  I have a video, albeit hard to really see much but shows car pulling.  Also note this is NOT a torque steer because it could happen on acceleration OR not.",

In some cases, it will almost appear to others you are drunk as it is working to keep you centered in your lane, but at times it will just pull you to the left side of your lane, so close to others that traffic will beep and I'll want to poop my pants, because it harder to pull back to center when this is doing the steering for you in cruise control mode.  Have turned off lane center assist and the speed control works fine, including slowing you down as traffic slows.  But with lane center assist on, and using cruise control, this is when erratic behavior exists.  Dealer could not duplicate the issue - would require taking this on a fast moving highway, like the PA turnpike, and hope it happens while out on that trip.  Does not always do it, and have to been able to figure out why it does it (I.E. double yellow line vs. white intermittent line).    When it happens, it puts you too close to traffic next to you and could cause other vehicles to either impact with you or make them swerve out of the way thinking you are coming into their lane.  Very serious when it happens, moving at high rate of speed, and lane centering when using speed control is very strong and harder to override vs. the small bump it gives you when not using speed control and too close to the shoulder for example.  That lane correction works well, albeit a bit weak to correct.    Has happened since new, August 2020.  And continues to happen sporadically.",

THEY CONTACTED THEIR TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NOT SEEN AN EXPLODING SUNROOF BEFORE AND THAT IT HAD TO BE A ROCK HITTING THE SUNROOF.

I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TOW OR PULL SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO HOOK OR HOLE TO ATTACH THE CABLE TO.  3.  EXPECTATION:  THIS IS THE FIRST CAR THAT THIS FEATURE IS ABSENT.  ALL OF THEM HAD THE CONVENIENT HOLE ATTACHED TO THE FRAME THAT THE CABLE CAN BE HOOKED INTO.  I EXPECT TOYOTA TO CORRECT THIS DEFICIENCY.  I BELIEVE IT IS A DEFECT THAT IS EASILY CORRECTED.  I CONTACTED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE TWICE AND ASK THE PERSON TO TAKE A PICTURE (IN CASE I MISSED IT) UNDERNEATH THE RAV4 2020 HYBRID AS TO WHERE THE CABLE HOOK SHOULD GO INTO.   I WAS GIVEN A NUMBER - TOYOTA MOTOR SALES, USA, INC. CASE FILE #2010151369.  THEY SAID THAT THEY CAN NOT TAKE A PICTURE, THEY REFERRED ME TO THE MANUAL.  THE MANUAL DOES NOT SHOW CLEARLY WHERE TO PLACE IT.   I TALKED WITH MANAGER OF BEAVER TOYOTA AND HE SAID THAT HE COULD SHOW ME WHERE TO PUT THE CABLE WHEN I GO THERE.  I ALREADY INSPECTED THE UNDERNEATH AND THERE IS NO CONVENIENT/SAFE/STURDY PLACE TO ATTACH IT.  4.  RECOMMENDATION:  TOYOTA SHOULD ADD THE HOOK OR HOLE ATTACHMENT FOR THE TOWING CABLE.  IT SHOULD BE WHERE THE HITCH WOULD BE ATTACHED TO.  DID TOYOTA MISS ATTACHING THIS FEATURE AT THE FACTORY ?   5. THIS IS BEYOND WHAT THE DEALERSHIP COULD CORRECT.  IT IS MORE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  6. I AM SENDING THIS COMPLAINT TO THE NHTSA BECAUSE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT SIMILAR 2020 RAV 4 HYBRID LIMITED ARE AFFECTED WITH THIS PROBLEM.

I NOTICED THAT OUR FIRST REFUELING I COULD NOT FILL THE  TANK MORE THAN 9.5 TO 10 GALS OF FUEL WHEN SYSTEM SAYS LOW FUEL.  THIS HAPPENS CONSISTENTLY SINCE THE FIRST FILL UP IN DEC 2019 TO NOW MAY 2020.  THE BEST MILEAGE TO EMPTY HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY 415 - 430 MILES TO EMPTY.

THE BEST I CAN OBTAIN IN TOWN IS 31.5 MPG.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN SEVERAL TIMES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO FIX IN PLACE FOR THE FUEL ISSUE, BUT THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAVE KNOWN OF THIS ISSUE SINCE 2019 MODELS.    THEY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR THE DAY AND RETURNED IT TO ME WITH A FUEL ECONOMY READING OF 61 MPG.  I WAS ASTONISHED AND ASKED HOW DID THEY DO THIS.  THERE WAS NOT REPLY.  JUST DRIVING THE VEHICLE HOME FROM THE DEALER THE FUEL ECONOMY STARTED TO FALL DRASTICALLY  AND WITHIN 2 DAYS THE ECONOMY WAS BACK TO 31.5 MPG.  *TR",

IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM AND I'M GETTING BLOWN OFF LIKE IT DON'T MATTER. I'M A TRAVEL NURSE AND DRIVING FROM STATE TO STATE AND DRIVING ON HIGHWAYS WITH THE SIDE MIRROR SHAKING WILL BE A DEFINITE SAFETY CONCERN. I BOUGHT A 2020 BRAND NEW CAR TO GET MORE SAFETY FEATURES WHILE I'M TRAVELING BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS NOT THE CASE. REALLY AFRAID THIS MIGHT CAUSE ACCIDENT.
