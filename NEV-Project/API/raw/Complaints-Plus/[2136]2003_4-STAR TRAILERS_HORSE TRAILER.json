        "summary": "VEHICLE IN QUESTION IS A HANNIGAN MOTORCYCLE TRAILER, SIERRA MODEL, MADE BY HANNIGAN MOTORSPORTS, 4044 HWY 641 SOUTH, MURRAY, KY  42071, (270) 753-4256.  I HAD TO LIST ANOTHER MANUFACTURER BECAUSE HANNIGAN IS NOT LISTED AND YOU CANNOT CONTINUE WITHOUT A MANUFACTURER.    TRAILER HAS UNUSUAL UNDERSIDE AERODYNAMICS THAT CAUSE ROAD DUST AND FINE SAND TO BE SUCKED FROM THE ROADWAY AND ON TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRAILER JUST BEHIND THE WHEELS.  DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT STARTED, AS THE AREA IS NOT READILY VISIBLE, BUT JUDJING FROM AFTER THE BODY WAS PENETRATED, THE EROSION IS VERY FAST AFTER THE GEL COAT PROTECTING THE FIBERGLASS IS WORN AWAY.  OPENING THE TRAILER ON 21 JULY, 2005, HAVING JUST ENTERED ALASKA, THE INTERIOR WAS VERY DUSTY.  AFTER UNLOADING I NOTICED TWO 6\" HOLES IN THE UNDERCARRIAGE.  NO REPAIR FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN TOK ALASKA, SO REPACKED TRAILER AND DROVE TO FAIRBANKS THE NEXT DAY.  NO REPAIR FACILITY THERE EITHER AND ON ENTERING A PARKING LOT APPARENTLY GEAR INSIDE THE TRAILER WAS HANGIN DOWN AND CAUGHT THE CURB.  TRAILER WENT AIRBORNE THEN LANDED LIKE AN ANCHOR.  I WAS FLUNG FORWARD AND HIT THE WINDSCREEN.  ON EXAMINATION THE HALD DAY'S DIVE HAD ERODED ANOTHER SQUARE FOOT OF THE BOTTOM, INCLUDING ALL FORWARD LEADING EDGES.  HAD THAT OCCURED AT ANY SPEED, EXPECIALLY ON A CURVE, LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE MOTORCYCLE WOULD HAVE BEEN INEVITABLE.  REPAIRED AS BEST I COULD WITH HEAVY RUBBER MAT AND DUCT TAPE AND WENT TO ANCHORAGE, WHERE THERE WAS A REPAIR FACILITY.  PART I HAD TAPED AND RUBERIZED SURVIVED, BUT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EROSION TO THE FORWARD EDGES BEHIND THE AXLE.  ENTIRE READ UNDERSIDE OF TRAILER REBUILT IN WASILA, AK, AND PROTECTIVE PLATE ADDED.",
