ONLY LUCKY TRAFFIC DIDN'T SLOW OR COME TO COMPLETE STOP BECAUSE IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD TO STEER TO ROADSIDE AND HAD HALF MILE TO STOP. TOWED TO CLOSEST SERVICE CENTER THAT DISCOVERED CHASSIS BATTERY DISCONNECT FAILED. RESEARCHED PROBLEM AND DISCOVERED MANY OTHERS HAD SAME PROBLEM. I LIVE IN COLORADO AND IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON MOUNTAIN PASS THE OUTCOME WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE SAME!!!  I SEARCHED RECALLS FOR MY VIN AND COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS NOT ON RECALL LIST.  DURING MY RESEARCH, MANY POSTS ON RV FORUMS STATED THEY FILED A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA. WHAT HAS BECOME OF ALL THESE COMPLAINTS?!?  WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS OF THIS ISSUE/INVESTIGATION?",
