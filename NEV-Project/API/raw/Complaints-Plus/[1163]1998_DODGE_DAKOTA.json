THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND ALTERNATOR HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE AND TWO O2 SENSORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. THE AIR CONDITIONER HAS BEEN REPAIRED FOUR TIMES.

THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP, AND THE TRUCK SKIDDED TO A STOP IN THE LEFT TURN LANE. MY HUSBAND HAD NO CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. WHEN WE TOOK THE TRUCK TO OUR MECHANIC, HE FOUND THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL WAS NEAR THE BREAKING POINT AS WELL AND REPLACED THAT AXLE AS WELL.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS CAN DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD, IN GOOD FAITH, MAKE THEM REIMBURSE OR RECALL ALL OF THESE VEHICLES HAVING THE PROBLEMS NOT JUST THE LAST 4 YEARS.

THAT MAKES 3/4 OF THE BALL JOINTS ON THE FRONT OF THIS TRUCK THAT WILL HAVE BEEN REPLACED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.   I WAS ELATED TO SEE WHERE THE NHTSA HAS REQUESTED CHRYSLER TO RECALL THE DAKOTA AND DURANGO AS A RESULT OF THESE BALL JOINT FAILURES.   I WAS EQUALLY DISMAYED TO SEE THAT IT ONLY COVERED 2000-2003!!!!  WHY?!!!  AS YOU READ ABOVE, MY TRUCK HAS FAILED EQUALLY IF NOT WORSE THAN THE MODELS THE NHTSA RECOMMENDED BE RECALLED.  NUMNEROUS WEB SITES ARE FILLED WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE SAME ISSUES ON VEHICLES THAT ARE OLDER THAN 2000.  I SUSPECT IT HAS TO DO WITH MONEY = ANYTHING MORE THAN 4 MODEL YEARS AND CHRYSLER WILL START SCREAMING.  IF THE FAILING BALL JOINTS ARE DANGEROUS ON THE 2000-2003 MODELS, THEN THE SAME FAILING BALL JOINTS ARE DANGEROUS ON THE OLDER MODELS TOO.  PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY MY SAFETY IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THOSE WITH TRUCKS TWO YEARS NEWER THAN MINE.  THANK YOU.*AK",

THE ARM WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY (34853 MILES).  I RECENTLY PURCHASED 4 NEW TIRES FOR THE TRUCK AND ASKED THE DEALER TO DO A FRONT END ALIGNMENT  (59423), HE TRIED AND SAID HE COULD NOT BECAUSE THE BALL JOINTS WERE DEFECTIVE.  I HAD NO INDICATION AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BALL JOINTS UNTIL I TRIED TO GET AN ALIGNMENT TO PROTECT THE NEW TIRES, I GOT A SECOND OPINION WITH THE SAME RESPONSE.  I WENT TO THE DODGE DEALER AND CONFIRMS THAT ALL 4 BALL JOINTS IN THE FRONT END WERE BAD, LOWER AND UPPER.  DEALER SAID IT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY, BUT I HAVE LESS THAN 60,000 MILES ON THE TRUCK AND IT IS MY THIRD BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER FRONT.  THIS TIME THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A PROBLEM AND IT COST ME OVER $1100 TO FIX AS IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY WAS LUCKY SINCE THE THERE WAS NO ACCIDENTS, THE PROBLEM WAS CAUGHT IN TIME.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE BALL JOINTS USED ON THE DODGE DAKOTA ARE DEFECTIVE AND DO NOT LAST, IN MY CASE THE REPLACED BALL JOINT IN SEPTEMBER 2000 LASTED LESS THAN 24,000 MILES UNDERSTAND THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT IN PROGRESS, CAN YOU PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS,  CHRYSLER/DAIMLER NEEDS TO STAND UP AND FIX THE PROBLEM BEFORE THERE IS A TRAGEDY.*AK",

AFTER ONE WEEK BEING IN THE SHOP THEY TOLD US THE ENGINE WAS BLOWN DUE TO NON-MAINTENANCE (OIL CHANGES).  WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WE HAD THE OIL CHANGED.  IT WAS NOT EVERY 3000 MILES BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT.  THEY TOLD US THAT THE OIL HAD NEVER BEEN CHANGED IN THIS TRUCK.  THIS IS TOTALLY UNTRUE.  WE GAVE THEM RECEIPTS WHERE IT WAS CHANGED AND THEY SAID THE INSPECTOR FROM CHRYSLER HAD TO CHECK IT OUT.  WE HAD TO PAY RUSSELL DODGE OVER $200.00 TO BREAK IT DOWN JUST FOR AN INSPECTION.  THE INSPECTOR FOR CHRYSLER CAME AFTER 3 DAYS AND SAID IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.

THE ORIGINAL CAB ISOLATORS HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE TRUCK MAKING A LOUD CLUNKING NOISE WHENEVER I TURNED A CORNER OR ENTERED/EXITED A DRIVEWAY.

THAT DIDN'T HELP SO THE TRUCK WENT BACK A THIRD TIME AND ANOTHER SET OF CAB ISOLATORS WERE INSTALLED AND THE CLUNKING SOUND DID NOT OCCUR AGAIN.

THE EXTREME OF THESE DOWNSHIFTS IS INDICATED BY THE FACT THAT AT 65 MPH THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE FORCED DOWN TO 2ND GEAR, THEREBY \"RED-LINING\" THE ENGINE ON THE TACH.
