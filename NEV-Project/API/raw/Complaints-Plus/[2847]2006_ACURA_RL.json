AT THE DEALER, I WAS TOLD THAT HOOMAN WAS NOT TAKING THE RECALLED VEHICLES, COULD NOT PROVIDE A DATE BY WHICH THE FIX WOULD BE MADE, BUT WOULD PROVIDE ME A RENTAL CAR WHICH I HAD TO GET THAT DAY BY NOON. I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE RECALLED ACURA BACK TO MY HOUSE.  THE COMPLAINT IS REGARDING  THE FALSE VEHICLE/RETENTION/STORAGE AGREEMENT WHICH I AM ATTACHING TO THIS COMPLAINT. IN SUM,  THE AGMT SAYS THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF HONDA TO RETAIN THE SUBJECT VEHICLE UNTIL PARTS ARE IN TO EFFECT THE REPAIR.  BUT THE PEOPLE AT THE DEALER TELL YOU THAT HOOMAN DEALERSHIP DOES NOT (AND NO DEALER)  RETAINS THE RECALLED VEHICLE. YET THE AGMT THAT THE DEALER WANTS THE CUSTOMER TO SIGN SAYS THAT CUSTOMER \"WISHES TO RETAIN THE VEHICLE\"  WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT MY WISH.  BOTTOM LINE, THEY WON'T TAKE THE RECALLED CAR THAT YOU DRIVE IN. THE CUSTOMER HAS  TO: 1) BRING TWO PEOPLE--ONE TO DRIVE THE RENTAL AND ONE TO DRIVE THE REJECTED AND UNSAFE CAR BACK, 2) HAVE A SPACE TO PARK AN ADDITIONAL CAR--WHICH I DON'T, AND 3)  THE DEALER CAN'T PROVIDE ANY DATE BY WHICH YOU CAN GET THE CAR FIXED--SO YOU CAN'T EVEN PAY TO STORE THE RECALLED CAR YOURSELF .

I HAD TO CALL THE DEALER TO FIND OUT THAT THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS WITH THE WHEELS IN ANY POSITION AND THE DRIVER HAS TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE LOCK BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL TURN. LUCKILY, I WAS PARKED IN A PARKING LOT AND NOT IN SOME HAZARDOUS LOCATION THAT REQUIRED THAT I IMMEDIATELY MOVE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS IN OTHER AUTOMOBILES BUT ONLY WHEN THE WHEELS WERE TURNED ALL THE WAS TO THE STOP. I HAVE A FRIEND THAT OWNS A LATE MODEL TOYOTA CAMRY WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE CAR BECAUSE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE. NOW THAT I KNOW HOW TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, I AM NOT WORRIED FOR MYSELF BUT IF SOMEONE ELSE WERE TO DRIVE THE CAR, THEY COULD BE IN TROUBLE.  *NM",
