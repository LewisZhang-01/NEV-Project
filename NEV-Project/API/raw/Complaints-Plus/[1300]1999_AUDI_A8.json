WITHOUT WARNING OR PRIOR INDICATION OF A PROBLEM, THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY CEASED TO OPERATE CORRECTLY WHILE TRAVELING ON A BUSY, FOUR-LANE URBAN HIGHWAY.

I NARROWLY AVOIDED A COLLISION WITH OTHER CARS.     I MANAGED TO DRIVE THE CAR BACK ABOUT 20 MILES TO MY RESIDENCE IN THE LIMP-HOME MODE--ONE FORWARD GEAR, THE ENGINE REVVING BETWEEN 3000 TO 5000 RPM'S WITH THE FORWARD SPEED NO MORE THAN 35 MPH. I PARKED THE CAR AND LEFT IT FOR A WEEK WHILE TRAVELING. WHEN I RETURNED IT WOULD NOT MOVE IN ANY GEAR. I HAD IT TOWED ON A FLAT-BED TRUCK TO AN AUDI DEALER. THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS AN INOPERABLE, UNREPAIRABLE TRANSMISSION BROUGHT ABOUT WHEN \"A BOLT SEPARATED FROM THE TRANSMISSION HOUSING CAUSING A HOSE TO LEAK TRANSMISSION FLUID WHICH RESULTED IN BURNT PARTS AND GEARS.

AFTER REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO AUDI CORPORATE, I WAS INFORMED THAT AUDI COULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EVENT BECAUSE THERE WERE \"NO OPEN CAMPAIGNS OR SERVICE ACTIONS\" RELATIVE TO THIS MODEL.
