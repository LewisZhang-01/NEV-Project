Fortunately on both occasions we were driving at low speeds on city streets and could pull over or drive slowly to a destination. There were no warnings that the steering was about to freeze, but both times the automatic lane departure light came on. In the second instance I was driving on a narrow street and I was not outside of my narrow lane or I would have hit the curb or oncoming cars. The car was checked once by a highly regarded mechanic who could find nothing wrong with the steering or electronic system. This was one day after the first incident and the steering worked normally on the short ride to the mechanic.  The car has now been at the dealer's service center.

In year 2, I noticed a repeated noise coming from the tires and assumed it was the brakes and had them serviced. During my research, I found many articles and complaints from Honda Accord drivers with the similar model and tire set-up as me complaining about this persistent noise from the tires and it was determined that the steel belt inside the tire has loosened or something and is free within the tire, causing this noise.  I stumbled upon a NHTSA recall notice on Continental tires for this exact reason, however the year of my car is not included within this recall. This is my request, to have the 2017 model year, where Honda mixed between Michelin tires and Continental tires - and for owners like me to be reimbursed with a new set of tires, free of cost.  Per the NHTSA recall, this overheating during the manufacturing process causes the steel belt to become free and could cause a blow out.

This feature seems to wear down the brakes with the sudden and unwarranted stopping; even producing the smell of brakes and tires burning.  All of these issues are extremely dangerous and can cause serious injury and even death nearly causing cars to hit me in the back. The lane departure and auto correction has caused the car to over correct and veer into other lanes or even off road. This is extremely concerning as it the auto correction can lasts for seconds and I was unable to stop it or regain steering control of the vehicle. These incidents have happened on several occassions and were reported to the dealership.",

I WAS INFORMED ABOUT 6 HOURS LATER MY NECKLACE CHAIN HANGING ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WAS SHORTING OUT THE CAR CAUSING MY ACCELERATION PROBLEM AND CHARGED $340.00.    I HAD MENTIONED BEFORE AND AFTER THIS DIAGNOSIS THAT A SAFETY RECALL ON THE FUEL PUMP WAS ISSUED TO THIS CAR AND WAS TOLD THE CHAIN ON MIRROR WAS THE PROBLEM. I WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN A PIECE OF MY CHAIN BACK WITH A SLIGHT EVENLY BURN MARK ON IT.       I STILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR MONEY TO GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DEALERSHIP ON GETTING THIS RESOLVED.     MY VIN # DOES NOT SHOW A RECALL NEEDED PRESENTLY, BUT I CURRENTLY COMMUTE 120 MILES A DAY IN THIS VEHICLE AND PRAY MY PROBLEM WILL NOT WORSEN OR IT STOP ALL TOGETHER DURING THIS TIME.

IN MY CASE THE NOISE RETURNED A WEEK AFTER DEALERSHIP (HONDA WORLD, WESTMINSTER, CA) ADDED TIRE BEAD SEALANT TO FRONT LEFT DRIVER SIDE TIRE. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE IN TORRANCE, CA ON 9/27/19  WHO REPORTED TIRES WERE NOT COVERED IN 36K WARRANTY. THIS COULD ALSO BE A WHEEL/RIM PROBLEM OR OTHER SUSPENSION PROBLEM. THE RIM AND TIRES APPARENTLY ARE TO HEAVY FOR CAR. CAR WAS PURCHASED NEW WITH THESE TIRES AND RIMS FROM FACTORY. IT IS RARE THAT A TIRE WILL PRODUCE A METAL ON METAL GRINDING NOISE. IT IS MY EXPECTATION THAT THE NTSB TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUS AS IT PRESENTS A SERIOUS ISSUE IF TIRE BLOWS UP OR TIRE BEAD DEFORMS. THE DEALER DECLINED TO FIX PROBLEMS AND BLAMED ISSUE ON TIRES. THEY SUGGESTED I PURCHASE ANOTHER TIRE. ONE TIRE COSTS APPROXIMATELY $250.00 DOLLARS. I'M IN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING  CONTINENTAL TIRE IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO ADDRESS ISSUE ALSO.

THIS NEARLY NEW VEHICLE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE 2007. IT IS MOSTLY GOOD BUT I DISCOVERED WHAT I CONSIDER A SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN THE BRAKE IS APPLIED, TO REDUCE SPEED OR COME TO A FULL STOP, THERE IS NEARLY A HALF SECOND DELAY AFTER LIFTING YOUR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL BEFORE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL BECOMES FUNCTIONAL. IF YOU HAPPENED TO DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR PRIOR TO THE END OF THE DELAY, THE VEHICLE LURCHES FORWARD AND YOU COULD IMPACT THE VEHICLE AHEAD OF YOU, OR IF YOU ARE MOVING FORWARD AND BRAKE AGAIN TO OFFSET THE FORWARD LURCH, THE VEHICLE BEHIND YOU COULD ASSUME YOU WERE MOVING FORWARD AND REAR END YOU BECAUSE YOU BRAKED UNEXPECTEDLY.   THIS SITUATION COULD ALSO BE A PROBLEM WHEN STOPPED ON A HILL EITHER UP OR DOWN. THE DELAY CREATES A MOMENT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF CONTROL AND UNSAFE.

THE TIRES ARE RUBBING PART OF THE SUSPENSION CREATING FRICTION THAT COULD RESULT IN FAILURE OF SIDE WALL THUS HAVING A BLOW OUT. THIS ISSUE IS PUTTING MY FAMILY AND MANY OTHER LIVES AT RISK. I HAVE MADE HONDA AWARE OF THIS ISSUE NUMEROUS TIMES AT THE HONDA WORLD DEALERSHIP LOCATED ON HURSTBOURNE LANE IN LOUISVILLE KY.  AFTER NUMEROUS VISITS TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, ADDITIONAL AIR WAS PUMPED IN THE TIRE AND THE TIRES WERE ROTATED. WHICH SOLVES NOTHING... WHICH IS A BANDAID.  IF YOU SEARCH YOUTUBE OR THE WEB, YOU WILL FIND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY CONSUMER WHOM HAS MADE HONDA AWARE OF THIS ISSUE OR IS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE.   THESE OTHER CONSUMERS WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH THIS SAME POTENTIAL DISASTER COULD PUT HONDA ON THE HOOK FOR SEVERE PROBLEMS. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT HONDA WORLD DIRECTED ME TO CALL HONDA CORPORATE AND WHILE SPEAKING WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, I ASKED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR. THE REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED THAT A MANAGER NOR A \"HIGHER UP\" WAS AVAILABLE FOR ME TO SPEAK WITH.   A FEW DAYS LATER, I RECEIVED A VOICEMAIL FROM CASE MANAGER, [XXX] AT HONDA WHO INFORMED ME THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THE TIRE BRAND AND RIM COMBINATION. AT THIS TIME, MY REQUEST FOR FOUR DIFFERENT BRAND TIRES THAT WILL NOT IMPACT MY SUSPENSION ON MY VEHICLE WAS DENIED. SHE INFORMED ME THAT IF I WANT TO PURCHASE FOUR NEW TIRES, I CAN DO SO. CLEARLY PUTTING THE DEFECT BACK IN THE CONSUMERS LAP TO FIX.

THE MOST CRITICAL INCIDENT OCCURRED ON 12/11/18 WHILE I WAS COMING TO A STOP IN A PARKING SPOT IN FRONT OF MY CONDOMINIUM.  WHILE TURNING RIGHT INTO THE PARKING SPOT AND APPLYING THE BRAKE, THE HONDA VIOLENTLY ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN. I APPLIED THE BRAKES HARDER, BUT HAD TO QUICKLY PUSH THE GEAR SHIFTER INTO PARK IN ORDER TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  THE HONDA HAD JUMPED THE CONCRETE CURB, DROVE OVER THE SIDEWALK AND CONTINUED ACROSS THE GRASS UNTIL IT STOPPED ABOUT 3 FEET IN FRONT OF THE CONDO BUILDING. IF I DIDN'T FORCE THE TRANSMISSION INTO PARK, THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE COLLIDED WITH THE BUILDING.  I WAS ABLE TO CALM DOWN,  RESTART THE CAR AND PUT THE HONDA IN REVERSE TO BACK UP OVER THE SAME CURB INTO THE PARKING SPACE. I CONTACTED DAVIS HONDA AND THEY SENT A TOW TRUCK TO TRANSPORT IT FOR SERVICE.  AS OF THIS DATE, DAVIS HONDA WILL BE TOWING THE HONDA ACCORD BACK TO MY ADDRESS IN MT. LAUREL, NJ.

LESS THAN 11,000 MILES, WE NOTICED THE FRONT PASSENGER BRAKES WERE GETTING REALLY LOW AND WEARING UNEVENLY COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE, I.E. SCREECHING; WHICH WAS ODD AND CONCERNING SINCE IT HAD 11,000 MILES AND ONLY ONE SIDE WAS WORN DOWN. DECEMBER 2017, THE PASSENGER FRONT BRAKES BECAME SO LOW, WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES THERE WAS A METAL ON METAL, GRINDING NOISE. WE VISUALLY INSPECTED THE BRAKES AND COULD SEE THE BRAKE PADS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WERE ALMOST NON-EXISTENT, AS WELL AS THE WEAR ON THE ROTORS. WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE ON 12-12-17 AND THEY CLAIMED THE BRAKE PADS WERE WEARING EVENLY/NORMAL; THE OTHER SERVICE STATION AT THIS LOCATION AGREED THAT ITS NOT NORMAL FOR THE CAR THE HAVE LESS THAN 12000 MILES FOR THE FIRST BRAKE PADS TO BE CHANGED LET ALONE WORN UNEVENLY. THE CONCERN WASN'T THE BRAKE PADS BEING CHANGED, IT IS THE MECHANICAL FUNCTION OF THE PISTON AND CALIPER WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM, OR ANOTHER UNDERLYING ISSUE; HAVING LESS THAN 12,000 MILES ISN'T RIGHT. THEY DIDN'T CARE, THOUGHT WE WANTED BRAKES CHANGED FOR FREE. WE FILED A CLAIM WITH HONDA REGARDING THE SAFETY AND WEAR OF THE BRAKES. THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE BRAKE PADS,TURNED THE ROTATORS. THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE AND THE PISTON GETTING \"HUNG\" MAY BE THE UNDERLINING REASON FOR WHY THE CAR LAGS WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE. IF IT IS DEPRESSED, ITS POSSIBLE THE BRAKES ARE WEARING DOWN WHILE ACCELERATING. SAFETY IS OUR FIRST CONCERN, AND WE FEEL THERE IS A DEEPER PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT.

ONE MONTH MY TPMS LIGHT CAME ON AND I STOPPED TO PUT AIR IN THE TIRE. THE LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OFF. I LATER WENT TO THE TIRE COMPANY FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE TIRE AND THEY SHOWED ME HOW TO RESET IT. AFTER ONLY 3 OR 4 MILES, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED. THE SERVICE MANAGER CORROBORATED WHAT THE TIRE COMPANY HAD TOLD ME AND THAT WAS THAT THE NEW SYSTEM ON HONDA CARS MEASURED, \"ROTATIONS\" AND NOT \"ACTUAL TIRE PRESSURE.\" SO, THE OFF-BRAND I WAS FORCED TO BUY WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE HONDA SENSOR SYSTEM AND THAT IT WAS A \"FLAW.\" THE TPMS MONITOR PROBLEM LIGHT CONTINUES TO COME ON EACH TIME I START THE CAR. I ASKED HIM HOW I COULD KNOW IF MY TIRES WERE REALLY LOW AND HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY CHECK THEM AND THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX IT!  I TOOK MY CAR IN AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE TIRE SYSTEM. THE SERVICE PERSON SPOKE WITH ME ABOUT THE TIRE LIGHT AND SAID THAT I HAD PURCHASED A NON-HONDA RECOMMENDED TIRE AND IT WAS MY FAULT.  I CALLED HONDA CORP AND AT FIRST THEY SAID THEY WOULD CALL HOEHN HONDA TO WORK WITH ME FOR A FIX. BUT I RECEIVED NO CALL. LATER I SPOKE WITH A HONDA CORP LADY WHO SAID THAT HONDA DID NOT SELL THE CAR AND THAT THE DEALER WAS RESPONSIBLE! TWO VERSIONS OF THE SOLUTION. I CALLED ANOTHER DEALER WHO SAID IT WAS MY FAULT AND THAT THE CAR INFO RECOMMENDS THE DEALER BRAND AND THAT THEY BE BOUGHT IN PAIRS OF TWO !  REALLY? SO, I DON'T HAVE A BROKEN TIRE MONITORING SYSTEM THAT I PAID FOR AND THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE I WILL NOT KNOW IF MY TIRES ARE FLAT. AND THE TBMS LIGHT IS ALWAYS ON! HELP",

OFTEN WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STATIONARY POSITION, OR EVEN A SLOW-TURN OR MERGE POSITION, THERE CAN BE A 1 TO 3 SECOND DELAY BETWEEN PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR AND ACTUALLY GETTING THE CAR TO MOVE. THIS CAN PRESENT A HIGHLY SERIOUS SITUATION. IN EFFECT, THE CAR CAN STALL FOR A 1 TO 3 SECOND PERIOD WHILE ONCOMING TRAFFIC CLOSES IN ON YOU. SOMETIMES YOU CAN PRESS THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WITH NO RESPONSE, ONLY TO HAVE THE CAR \"LURCH\" A SECOND OR TWO LATER. THE PROBLEM HAPPENS MOST FREQUENTLY IN CITY DRIVING AFTER THE CAR HAS WARMED UP. MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER SAYS THERE IS NO KNOWN FIX FOR THIS WIDELY REPORTED PROBLEM.
