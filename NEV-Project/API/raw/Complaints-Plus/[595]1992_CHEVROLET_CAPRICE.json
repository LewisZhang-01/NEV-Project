AFTER DRIVING FROM NEW YORK TO OKLAHOMA IN JANUARY OF 2001, I EXPERIENCED TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE AS A RESULT OF THE LEAKING OF THE ABS MODULATOR ON THIS CAR.  A USED ABS MODULATOR WAS PURCHASED AND WAS USED TO REPLACE THE FAILED PART.  ON 4-24-2001, I CAME ACROSS A SAFETY ALERT FOR THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE IN THE INTERNET THAT INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL FOR THE PART THAT HAD FAILED IN MY VEHICLE.  THE RECALL # IS GM CAMPAIGN #97058 AND THE NHTSA # IS 97V217.  THE SAFETY ALERT STATES THAT \"DEALERS WILL INSPECT THESE VEHICLES AND REPLACE THE ABS MODULATOR.\"  TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THIS WORK WAS NEVER DONE NOR DID I EVER RECEIVE NOTICE OF A RECALL.  I SPOKE WITH A CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE PERSON AT 1-800-222-1020 REGARDING THIS MATTER TODAY AND WAS INITIALLY TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THIS PERSON AGREED THAT NOT ONLY WAS MY VEHICLE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL BUT THAT THE RECALL WORK HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON 5-27-99 WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD 91K MILES.  I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WORK WAS NEVER DONE AND THE PART WAS NEVER REPLACED ON THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE THE ORIGINAL PART AND THE USED PART THAT I PURCHASED TO REPLACE IT SEEMS TO BE OK FOR NOW.  THE CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE PERSON WAS UNABLE TO TELL ME WHICH DEALERSHIP PERFORMED THE WORK.  SHE GAVE ME A FILE # WHICH WAS C03934587.  I BELIEVE THAT CHEVROLET SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF A NEW ABS MODULATOR AND THE LABOR TO INSTALL IT.  THIS SEEMS TO BE THE INTENT OF THE RECALL NOTICE AS I READ IT.  MY NEAREST CHEVROLET DEALER IS DAVIDSON CHEVROLET ON OUTER WASHINGTON ST, IN WATERTOWN, NY 13601. THEIR # IS 315-782-8300.
