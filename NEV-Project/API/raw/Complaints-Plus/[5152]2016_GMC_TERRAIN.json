THE INITIAL PEDAL ASSEMBLY BROKE AT 26,722 MILES, WHEN THE CAR WAS ONLY 18 MONTHS OLD. THE PART WAS REPLACED, UNDER WARRANTY, AT A CERTIFIED GM DEALER. THE ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN ANOTHER 18 MONTHS LATER. UNFORTUNATELY GM ONLY CERTIFIES THE PART FOR 12 MONTHS AND 12,000 MILES, SO I HAD TO PAY FOR THE SECOND PEDAL ASSEMBLY OUT OF POCKET. THE SECOND REPAIR WAS ALSO DONE AT A CERTIFIED GMC DEALERSHIP.    THIS RECURRING HISTORY OF ISSUES IS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT GM IS USING A FAULTY PART IN THIS VEHICLE,WHICH CREATES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE FOR DRIVERS. WHEN THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY BREAKS DOWN, IT AUTOMATICALLY PUTS THE CAR INTO LOW ENGINE POWER MODE. IF YOU ARE DRIVING ON A FREEWAY, YOUR SPEED WILL SUDDENLY DROP FROM 70 MPH TO 25 MPH IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. FURTHER,  THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO ABILITY TO ACCELERATE WHEN THE CAR IS IN LOW POWER MODE.    THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT EVENTUALLY THE CAR WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS/USES. THE ENGINE LIGHT WILL GO OFF AND GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ISSUE NO LONGER EXISTS, OR WAS A FALSE ALARM. THEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING. I HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE HAPPEN TO ME ON 7 DIFFERENT OCCASSIONS, IN A VARIETY OF DRIVING CONDITIONS (HIGHWAY, CITY, FREEWAY, ETC).    I'VE SPENT THE PAST 5 WEEKS WORKING WITH GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE TRYING TO GET A RESOLUTION. THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY DO NOT THINK THIS IS A FAULTY PART, AND HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY ASSISTANCE. THEY ARE IGNORING THE FACTS AND HISTORY OF MY CASES, INCLUDING MULTIPLE GMC CERTIFIED DIAGNOSES CONFIRMING THAT THE SAME PART CONTINUES TO BREAK.     I WOULD ENCOURAGE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND HOLD GM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS. IT CREATES SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISKS FOR DRIVERS, AND IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON DRIVERS.",
