I CONTACTED THE DEALER WITH THE RECALL INFORMATION AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PART HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED BY THE RECALL BUT DID NOT HAVE A REPLACEMENT DATE.  THEY NOTED THAT BECAUSE THE PART HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED AND IT HAD BEEN OVER 1 YEAR THEY ARE NO LONGER UNDER ANY FURTHER OBLIGATION.  MY PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART HAS THE SAME DEFECT PROBLEMS AND CREATES THE SAME HAZARDS AS THE ORIGINAL PART THAT WAS COVERED IN THE RECALL.  I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GET IT FIXED BUT WANTED TO FILE A COMPLAINT THAT REPLACEMENT IS JUST AS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS AS THE ORIGINAL PART THAT WAS RECALLED.

ALSO THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK PROPERLY THEY STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW OR DON'T WORK AT ALL. ALSO THE FRONT SUSPENSION HAS BEEN REPLACED NUMEROUS TIMES AND I MEAN EVERYTHING STEERING BOX TIE ROD ENDS YOU NAME IT BEEN REPLACED BUT THE TRUCK STILL WANDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD AND KEEPS GETTING WORSE TOOK IT TO MECHANIC AND THEY ARE NOT FINDING ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.
