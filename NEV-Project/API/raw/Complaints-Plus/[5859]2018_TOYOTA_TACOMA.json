I changed the spark plugs and checked the coils which were good. Next day was I was driving and truck had the same problems and eventually died and would not restart. I took it to the toyota dealer and they checked numerous things and had found #1 cylinder intake value was leaking. They suggested to replace the entire motor at a cost of $12,000. I declined and took it to another mechanic to see if the head just needed replacing. In that time I found others were having the same problem and it was a malfunctioning part in the intake manifold. https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/2016-tacoma-in-limp-mode-fixed.659782/ This is the forum were I found the problem and it fixed it. A piece of it was holding my intake valve open and that was the cause of it not starting and the leaking valve. I went and showed the Toyota dealer and they were not aware of that problem. I would like it to get posted so others don't get con into putting a new motor if it has the same problem.

SO, I HAVE TO GO INTO THE DASH MENU AND SHUT IF OFF EVERY TIME I START THE CAR, OR I'M FORCED TO FIDDLE WITH IT ON THE FLY IN TRAFFIC.  IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A VEHICLE AND NOT ALLOW THE DRIVER THE OPTION TO PERMANENTLY DISABLE IT.  I COMPLAINED TO TOYOTA (CASE#1807122684) AND TOLD THEM THAT THIS REPRESENTS A SERIOUS DEFECT/DESIGN FLAW AND THAT EVENTUALLY IT WAS GOING TO CAUSE ME OR SOMEONE ELSE TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT, AND THEY DIDN'T CARE.  THEY MAINTAIN THAT SOMEHOW CONSTANTLY DISTRACTING THE DRIVER IS A SAFETY FEATURE AND THAT THE TRUCK IS SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.      AS MORE OF THESE FEATURES BECOME STANDARD THE NTSB HAS TO REGULATE THEM AND FORCE MANUFACTURERS TO CONSIDER THAT NOT ALL DRIVERS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO BEEPS AND ALARMS AND THESE DEVICES ARE THE OPPOSITE OF HELPFUL IN THOSE CASES.  THEY ARE DANGEROUS.  MAYBE THIS \"FEATURE\" HELPS SOME DRIVERS, BUT TO ME IT IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY FOR THE DRIVER TO PERMANENTLY DISABLE THESE TYPES OF FEATURES AND MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE",

SEEING ALL THIS I DECIDED TO HEAD TO THE DEALERSHIP BIG HORN IN GLENWOOD SPRINGS, CO AT ABOUT 1:00PM FROM MY HOUSE IN BASALT, CO.

A BRAND NEW $38,000 TRUCK THAT I HAVEN?T EVEN MAKE THE FIRST PAYMENT IS STUCK IN THE ROAD. MY TRUST AND LOVE FOR THE BRAND AND ITS SERVICES HAS BEEN LOST. HOW CAN I TRUST TO DRIVE MY FAMILY SAFE THINKING IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD THAT THIS CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN AGAIN?
