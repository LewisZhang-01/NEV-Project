THE VEHICLE HAS SHUT DOWN ON ME IN CITY TRAFFIC QUITE A FEW TIMES AND ONCE ON AN EXIT RAMP OF THE HIGHWAY. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION TO EXPERIENCE. THE DEALER MENTIONED POSSIBLE SPARK PLUG ISSUES. WHEN THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" ICON FINALLY CAME ON, I HAD IT READ BY THE DEALER AND AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE CODE IS A P2104. THE DEALER NEVER GOT BACK TO ME ON A REMEDY FOR THIS. THE MECHANIC SAYS THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL MUST BE REPLACED AND COULD BE THE CAUSE OF BOTH ISSUES. BOTH HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO THE DEALER BEFORE THEIR WARRANTY EXPIRED. I'M FINDING THE REPAIR COULD COST ABOUT $700. AN ISSUE OF THE ENGINE SHUTTING OFF, REGARDLESS OF SPEED, WHILE DRIVING IS VERY DANGEROUS. THE TRUCK MUST BE PLACED IN PARK, TURNED OFF, THE RE-STARTED BEFORE CONTINUING  MY DRIVE.

I DEBATED WHETHER TO CALL AAA OR 911.  AS THE SMOKE INCREASED I CALLED 911.  I THEN WENT TO THE CAR TO GET MY PURSE.

I HAVE RESEARCHED ONLINE AND HAVE OBSERVED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY PEOPLE. THERE ARE FORUMS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM FOUND ON COUNTLESS WEBSITES. FURTHERMORE, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WHEN THIS OCCURRED I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT.     THIS EXPEDITION HAS HAD MANY ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING: TURN SIGNAL FAILURE, FUEL PUMP MODULE FAILURE, LIGHTS AND SIGNALS RANDOMLY NOT WORKING, WIPERS RANDOMLY NOT WORKING, ETC. I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY REPAIRING THESE ISSUES. I AM FED UP WITH THEM AND I AM CONTACTING YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL ISSUES IN THIS CAR ARE FINALLY BECOMING UNSAFE.

I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN AT SPEEDS OF 55+ MPH AS WELL AS SPEEDS OF APPROX LESS THAN 10 MPH, SUCH AS WHILE IN A PARKING LOT.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED IN THE SUMMER OF 2009, AND HAS HAPPENED EVERY MONTH SINCE, SOMETIMES SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE MONTH.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO HAVE IT TESTED AND WERE TOLD IT WAS A TPS SENSOR.  THAT HAS BEEN REPLACED ($75.00) BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL HAPPENING.  I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND IT IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 EXPEDITIONS.  I PERSONALLY KNOW OF 2 OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE ENTIRE THROTTLE BODY REPLACED, ONE OF WHICH HAS HAD IT REPLACED TWICE NOW.  THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN SINCE YOU DO LOOSE ALL POWER AND HAVE TO TRY TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHILE TRYING TO AVOID BEING HIT BY OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.  MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE RESULT WILL BE A ACCIDENT WHILE TRYING TO GET THE VEHICLE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE REPAIR COST FOR JUST THE PARTS IS $600.00, BUT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LABOR.  FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THIS PART BEFORE SOMEONE DOES DIE OR IS SERIOUSLY INJURED, AS IT IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.  FORD AND THEIR DEALERS ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, YET THE ONLY RESOLUTION IS TO HAVE THE CONSUMER PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE NOW BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT HAVE THE OLD TPS SENSOR, BUT THE VEHICLE IS STILL DOING THIS AND DO STILL HAVE THE THROTTLE BODY THAT IS BAD ON THE VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION.

APPARENTLY THEY FROZE OPEN AND ALLOWED TOO MUCH FUEL INTO THE SYSTEM.  SINCE FORD IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM THEY HAVE EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO VEHICLE OWNERS FOR THE DEFECTIVE FUEL INJECTORS TO 120,000 MILES.  LATE LAST YEAR THEY SENT OUT A LETTER TO IMPACTED VEHICLE OWNERS. HOWEVER, THEY ONLY REPLACE THE FUEL INJECTORS AS THEY GO BAD.

THE ENGINE COULD STOP AT ANY MOMENT LEAVING US IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN TRAFFIC OR IN A REMOTE AREA, AND WITH THE FLOODING OF FUEL INTO THE SYSTEM THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF FIRE.

ON 11-23-05 I BROUGHT IT OVER TO HAVE SOME DEFECTS REPAIRED.    DEFECTS THAT WERE TO BE FIXED.  TRANSMISSION.    WHEN STOPPED ON A HILL IF YOU REMOVE YOUR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE THE VEHICLE WILL ROLL OUT OF CONTROL.   THIS HAPPENS IF YOU ARE STOPPED WITH THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE GOING DOWN A HILL OF IN DRIVE GOING UP A HILL.   THE TRANSMISSION WILL SHIFT AT ODD TIMES AS YOU ARE DRIVING.  REAR PASSENGER DOME LIGHT FLICKERS WHEN YOU TURN IN ON WITH THE SWITCH IN THE BACK.  RIGHT TURN SIGNAL FLASHES VERY FAST.  TIRES ARE VERY BAD OUT OF BALANCE.  DRIVER DOOR DOES NOT LATCH UNLESS IT IS SHUT HARD.  I TOLD JESSE THAT THEY HAD TO BE DONE BY 5:00 PM.  AFTER KEEPING THE VEHICLE ALL DAY NOTHING WAS FIXED.  DURING MY VISIT IN YOUR OFFICE ON 12-9-05 YOU ASSURED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE REPLACED.   YOU ALSO STATED THAT FORD WAS AWARE OF THE BAD TIRES AND WOULD REPLACE THEM NOW THAT I HAD COMPLAINED.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE THE FOLLOWING NEW DEFECTS HAVE BEEN FOUND.  TURN SIGNALS WILL SOMETIMES NOT WORK AT ALL.  WHEN MAKING A SHARP TURN THE REAR END WILL SLIP.  YOU CAN FILL IT NOT HOLDING THE ROAD.  OUTSIDE FUMES ARE SUCKED INTO THE VEHICLE.   ANY SMELL OR EXHAUST FROM THIS OR OTHER VEHICLES IS PULLED INSIDE.    THE LEATHER ON THE FRONT SEATS HAS TURNED BLACK.  THE TRANSMISSION, REAR END PROBLEM AND TIRES ARE ALL MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEMS. THESE MUST BE FIXED.  I FEEL THAT HAVING MY WIFE DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH THESE PROBLEMS IS PUTTING HER IN DANGER.  THE TURN SIGNALS AND LIGHT PROBLEM ARE POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARDS.  THE UNCONTROLLED AIR INTAKE IS A PROBLEM THAT COULD CAUSE PEOPLE INSIDE THE VEHICLE TO BE GASSED BY A PASSING VEHICLE.  MY WIFE HAS VERY BAD ALLERGIES WHEN THESE SMELLS ARE PULLED INTO THE VEHICLE SHE HAS TROUBLE BREATHING.  I HAVE NEVER OWNED ANYTHING MADE FROM LEATHER THAT HAS CHANGED COLORS.   *NM",
