A NEW AFTERMARKET BATTERY (INTERSTATE) WAS PUT IN THE VEHICLE.  2 WEEKS AFTER THE NEW BATTERY WAS INSTALLED, MY CAR WOULD NOT START AGAIN.  THE CAR HAS NO AFTERMARKET PARTS, ACCESSORIES, OR REMOTE START.      I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER AND THEY CANNOT SEEM TO FIND THE PROBLEM.  SEWELL LEXUS CONTACTED LEXUS ABOUT THIS, AND LEXUS ADVISED THEM THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH MY MODEL YEAR VEHICLE AND THEY BELIEVE IT IS AN UNKNOWN COMPUTER PART RANDOMLY TURNING ON AND DRAINING THE BATTERY.  THEY SAID THIS MAINLY HAPPENS WITH VEHICLES SITTING FOR A FEW DAYS.  THEY SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE A CURRENT FIX FOR THE CAR.  THE DEALER RECOMMENDED INSTALLING A BATTERY TENDER IN MY CAR.
