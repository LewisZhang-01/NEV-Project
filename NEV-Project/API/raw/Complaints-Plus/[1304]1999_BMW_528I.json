THE DEALERSHIP HAS BASICALLY BLAMED THE SITUATION ON US AND NOT THE FAILURE OF THIS BMW ENGINE THAT WAS MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO THEIR MAINTENANCE STANDARDS. THERE IS REAL PROBLEM WITH BMW ENGINES AND BASED UPON MY RESEARCH IT RELATES TO BOLTS ON THE OIL PUMP LOOSENING FROM THE CAR'S VIBRATION THEREBY NOT ALLOWING OIL TO BE PUMP INTO THE ENGINE.
