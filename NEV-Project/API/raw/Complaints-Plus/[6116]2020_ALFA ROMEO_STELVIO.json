THESE CONTINENTAL TIRES RATING 'H' TOP SPEED IS 130 MPH. ALFA ROMEO'S SPOKESPERSON STATED THAT THE TIRE ON THE CAR CAME FROM ITALY WITH THESE TIRES, SO ALFA ROMEO WANTS ME TO CALL THE DEALERS AND WAIT AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY. I AM AFRAID SOMEONE COULD GET HURT OR KILLED FROM A TIRE BLOWOUT.   THE TIRES ARE CONTINENTAL  CROSS SECTION LX SPORT RATING 'H,' AND THE TOP SPEED OF THIS MAKER'S TIRE IS 130 MPH; HOWEVER, THIS MOTORCAR CAN AND HAS REACHED 144 MPH.",
