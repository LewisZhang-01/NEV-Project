There is approximately a 1 inch gap between the 2 pieces as well as multiple cracks. Also the rear sensors on the bumper I had replaced one and the part cost me $20 or less. I am disabled and was able to have a friend get under the rear of the truck and change 1 sensor. There still was a code and I had nobody around that could help me and I was due for inspection and thought I may get failed if they see a code. With that I brought my vehicle to Schumacher Chevrolet in Livingston NJ.  So they told me I had another bad sensor and I had no way to clear the code so I had them do the repair. They told me the same part I brought for under $20 cost me there almost $300 for the sensor.. Do they have to use their parts or should they had given me the opportunity to get an aftermarket one whether they got it or I got it and then have them finish the job.  Needless to say I walked out with a bill around $500. I\u2019m permanently disabled and receive  a little money from  S.Security every months. That cost my 1/3 of my entire check for the month.  I always thought they give you an option or aftermarket parts. I\u2019ve had other vehicles in my life before I was disabled and always was asked.  I\u2019m really disappointed in the condition of the dash  and the crazy amount for a part.  Note I do have a 2008 F-Series Super Duty truck with a little over 108,000 miles and my Suburban only has 89,000 miles yet my Ford dash doesn\u2019t have one crack in the dash.  I also had a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe and sold that in 2010 and got the new truck I mentioned but I have well over 120,000 miles on it and that didn\u2019t have any dash cracks.  That should be held accountable obviously it\u2019s an issue with the company or how they are making the dash.  My 75th Anniv Suburban should not have dash issues with as much as the vehicle costs.

ONE OF THESE CRACK IS IN THE AREA OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WHICH IS MOUNTED ON TOP OF THE DASH.  AS THE DASH EXPANDS IN THE HEAT, TYPICALLY IN THE HOT MONTHS OF THE SUMMER, THE PLASTIC PORTION OF THE DASH WILL COVER THE AIRBAG PORTION OF THE DASH.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IF I DO NOT NOTICE THIS AND THE VEHICLE IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH, THE AIRBAG WILL NOT OPERATE PROPERLY.  I AM AFRAID VEHICLE OCCUPANTS MIGHT BE INJURED BY THE DASH IF THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED UNDER THE PLASTIC PORTION OF THE DASH OR THAT THEY WILL BE INJURED IF THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY PROPERLY.      THERE ARE ALSO TWO CRACKS IN THE DASH IN THE AREA OVER THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER WHICH ALLOWS A PORTION OF THE DASH TO BE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE MAIN DASHBOARD.  THIS PORTION OF THE DASH THAT CAN BE REMOVED CAUSES A PROBLEM ON LONG TRIPS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WILL VIBRATE OUT OF PLACE.  MY CONCERN WITH THIS PIECE IS ITS LOCATION IN RELATION TO THE STEERING WHEEL.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THIS PIECE MOVES OUT OF PLACE, IT COULD MOVE INTO THE OPEN AREA AT THE TOP OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND INTERFERE WITH MY ABILITY TO CONTROL THE STEERING OF THE VEHICLE.

IN REGARDS TO BOTH OF THESE ISSUES, THE CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED THAT GM IS AWARE OF BOTH PROBLEMS, BUT THAT THEY ARE STILL INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS.  HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE DASH PROBLEMS?  THIS HAS BEEN A WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT AFFECTS MANY VEHICLES, YET GM CLAIMS NOT TO KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT OR TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INFERIOR DASHES THAT WERE PLACED IN QUITE FEW YEAR MODELS OF THEIR VEHICLES.

THEY DIAGNOSED A BATTERY THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED (NO INDICATION OF CHECK ENGINE CODE ON RECEIPT JUST BATTERY TESTED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED) DROVE FOR A WEEK WITH NO PROBLEM THEN LEFT FOR MY HOME IN PENNSYLVANIA. IN VIRGINIA AFTER REFUELING AND ABOUT READY TO GET ON THE INTERSTATE THE SAME THING HAPPENED! THIS WAS A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. WITH NO POWER, BREAKS OR STEERING I MANAGED TO GET SAFELY OFF THE ROAD. AGAIN I WAS ABLE TO START THE VEHICLE AFTER A MINUTE AND BEING A SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH NO DEALER SERVICE AVAILABLE I DECIDED TO RISK THE REST OF THE DRIVE HOME. THANKFULLY I MADE IT AND ON MONDAY I CALLED CHEVROLET DIRECTLY TO ASK THEM WHY THE FLORIDA DEALER MIS-DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM, ASKED WHY THIS HAPPENED AND IF THERE WAS ANY RECALLS OR SERVICE BULLETINS. THEY DIRECTED ME TO SUTLIFF CHEVROLET IN HARRISBURG, PA. I DID GET A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AFTER THE SECOND FAILURE BUT THE LIGHT WAS OFF BY MONDAY. THEY READ A P0601 CODE AND REPLACED AND REPROGRAMED ECM. (ENGINE CONTROL MODULE I BELIEVE). THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DEALER IN FLORIDA IS FILED WITH CHEVROLET BUT I AM FILING THE INCIDENT WITH NHTSA BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPUTER FAILURE WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
