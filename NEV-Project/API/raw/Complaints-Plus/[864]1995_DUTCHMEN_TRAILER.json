DURING A CAMPING TRIP THIS WEEK, WHILE TRYING TO RAISE THE ROOF ON THE POPUP CAMPER, THE SIDE BOLTS ON TWO SIDES OF THE CAMPER (4 BOLTS TOTALED) PULLED THROUGH THE ROTTED WOOD UNDER THE ROOF AND ALLOWED THE CAMPER TOP TO DROP.  FORTUNATELY, WE SCRAMBLED AWAY FROM THE CAMPER JUST IN TIME.  THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED DEATH OR SEVERE INJURY.  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION, THE WOOD ON THE SIDES AND FRONT AND BACK OF THE CAMPER ROOF IS BASICALLY DANGEROUS, SO THE CAMPER PROBABLY WILL SIT IN OUR GARAGE WHERE IT WAS STORED...UNUSABLE AND A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  DUTCHMEN SHOULD BE AWARE OF HOW UNFAIR THIS IS TO A CONSUMER AND IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE DIES OR IS VERY SERIOUSLY HURT! *TR",

WHEN I MENTIONED THAT WE NEVER RECEIVED A NOTICE ABOUT RECALL, YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP STATED THAT \"BECAUSE WE DIDN'T RESPOND, WE WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL\". I ASKED WHICH ADDRESS THEY SHOWED ON FILE (WHICH WAS THE CORRECT ADDRESS), SHE MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.      BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE, I JUST WENT OUT AND RE-CHALKED THE ROOF (AND RE-CHALK, AND RE-CHALKED, YEAR AFTER YEAR). THE PLASTIC COVERING OF THE ROOF HAS CRACKED IN SO MANY PLACES THAT NO MATTER HAVE MUCH I CHALK WATER HAS STILL CONTINUED TO LEAK. THE CAMPER IS USE ONCE A YEAR FOR 4 DAYS DURING A STATE HORSE SHOW. THE REST OF THE TIME, THE CAMPER IS COVERED.     WELL, THIS PAST WEEKEND, WHILE AT THE SHOW, THE ROOF COLLAPSED (THANK GOD WE HAD THE EXTRA SUPPORT ARMS IN PLACE) TRAPPING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN THE CAMPER.

AS FOR THE STATEMENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT CONTACTED US IN A TIMELY MANOR, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SINCE WE DID NOT EVER ISSUE A RECALL.
