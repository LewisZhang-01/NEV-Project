IF THIS OCCURS, THE EVAPORATOR HOUSING MAY FILL UP WITH CONDENSATION AND OVERFLOW INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT, AND INTO THE BLOWER MOT...IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, I PAID MY LOCAL MITSUBISHI DEALER $310.50 TO REPLACE MY BLOWER MOTOR BECAUSE DEBRIS HAD CLOGGED THE MOTOR CAUSING IT TO SHORT OUT AND RESULTING IN LEAVING MY PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD UNDER AN INCH OF WATER.  MY CAR NOW, IS OUT OF WARRANTY. HOWEVER, IF I HAD KNOWN THERE WAS A PROBLEM, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A FILTER TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM. MY QUESTION IS: AT WHAT POINT DOES NHTSA MAKE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS INTO RECALLS? IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD WHEN MY DEALER INFORMS ME THAT TSB'S ARE ONLY FIXED IF A CUSTOMER COMPLAINS ABOUT THE CAR.  IT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG FOR MITSUBISHI TO KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING POTENTIALLY WRONG WITH YOUR CAR AND NOT INFORM YOU OF IT.

AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE THE VEHICLE HAD 2,074 MILES ON IT. WHEN I ASKED, THE SALESMAN TOLD US THAT THE VEHICLE WAS BRAND NEW AND THE MILES WERE FROM USING THE CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP AS A DEMONSTRATION CAR.   SINCE THEN THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALER THREE SEPARATE TIMES FOR SERVICE. IT WAS DRIVEN IN ON ONE OCCASION AND TOWED IN TWICE. THE DATES OF SERVICE ARE AS FOLLOWS 02/25/03, 06/09/03 AND 06/17/03. THE PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME, THE CAR STALLS OUT, THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND IT WILL NOT START AGAIN. THIS VEHICLE HAS STALLED SEVERAL TIMES IN TRAFFIC, CAUSING MY FIANCE TO FEAR DRIVING IT. ALSO, BETWEEN OIL CHANGES (EVERY 3,000 MILES) THE CAR LOOSES BETWEEN ONE AND ONE HALF QUARTS OF OIL. WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO CHECK THIS PROBLEM I WAS TOLD, ALL THREE TIMES, THAT THIS IS NORMAL OIL LOSS. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE STILL NOT CHECKED FOR OIL LEAKS.  ON 6/18/2003, AFTER BEING TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, I DECIDED TO CHECK INTO THE VEHICLE'S HISTORY. I USED CARFAX.COM AND FOUND SOME VERY DISTURBING NEWS. MY VEHICLE HAS HAD AT LEAST THREE PREVIOUS OWNERS AND IS NOT THE BRAND NEW CAR I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE. IT STARTED OUT IN PLEASANTVILLE NJ, AND THEN IT WAS REGISTERED IN ARIZONA, WHERE IT WAS SOLD AT AUCTION WITH 1,902 MILES ON IT AND FINALLY ENDED UP AT PERUZZI MITSUBISHI, WHERE WE PURCHASED IT.  I FEEL THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS SOLD TO US UNDER FALSE PRETENSES, AND THAT PERUZZI MITSUBISHI IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EITHER REPLACING THE VEHICLE WITH A BRAND NEW ONE OR GIVING US OUR MONEY BACK.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN RESOLVING THIS MATTER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  SINCERELY,  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
