UNTIL THIS REPAIR IS PERFORMED, A FIRE COULD OCCUR AT ANY TIME.  A FIRE CAN OCCUR EVEN IF THE KEY IS NOT IN THE IGNITION, AND CAN OCCUR EVEN IF THE SPEED CONTROL SYSTEM IS NEVER USED.\"  AFTER RECEIVING THE LETTER, I FILED A REPORT WITH FORD TO POSSIBLY GET SOME FORM OF COMPENSATION FOR MY CAR SINCE I MY CAR WAS INSURED FOR LIABILITY ONLY.

HOWEVER, THE MORE IMPORTANT REASON IS THE KNOWN POTENTIAL DANGER OF THIS DEFECT ON THE LIVES OF OTHERS WITHOUT HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. TODAY COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FATAL INJURY AND THE FORD COMPANY IS JUST LOOKING AT THE DOLLAR SIZE INSTEAD OF DOING THE RESPONSIBLE THING. IT'S A REAL SHAME AND I HOPE ODI CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I WAS LUCKILY TODAY, BUT OTHERS MAY NOT BE IN THE FUTURE. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL - THAT WOULD HAVE BE THE RESPONSIBLE THING FOR FORD TO DO. SOMEONE HAS TO FORCE THEM TO TAKE A MORE COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO THESE TYPES OF MATTERS - IT DOESN'T MAKE GOOD BUSINESS SENSE OR GOOD PUBLIC RELATIONS NOT TO. I AM COUNTING ON YOU TO HELP DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND HELP SAVE FUTURE LIVES AND INJURIES.

ON 11/27/99, I TOOK THE CAR INTO A LOCAL SHOP (EXPRESS OIL CHANGE) FOR BRAKE INSPECTION. THE CAR NEEDED FRONT BRAKE PADS AND WHEN THE FRONT WHEEL BRAKE ROTORS WERE TURNED, ALL THAT WAS LEFT ON THEM WAS .965 IN USEABLE METAL. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE ROTORS WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED ON MY NEXT BRAKE PAD REPLACEMENT. I WALKED ACROSS THE STREET TO VULCAN LINCOLN-MERCURY DEALERSHIP AND ASKED MR. MARSHALL AVERY  (SERVICE ADVISOR) WHY THE PROBLEM WITH BRAKE ROTORS ON MY AUTOMOBILE, AND HE STATED THAT FORD WAS NOT USING THE SAME METAL THICKNESS ONCE USED IN MANUFACTURE OF BRAKE ROTORS WOULD BE HIS GUESS. WHY DOES AN AUTOMOBILE WHICH IS MINIMALLY DRIVEN TO AND FROM WORK NOT HAVE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS LARGE ENOUGH IN THICKNESS TO ALLOW MORE THAN ONE TURNING? IT WOULD SEEM THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS REDUCED THE THICKNESS OF ITS BRAKE ROTORS TO A DANGEROUSLY THIN LEVEL. THIS IS A RIP-OFF OF THE AUTOMOTIVE CONSUMER IN THAT ONLY 31,000 MILES CAN BE EXPECTED WITH A PAIR OF FRONT BRAKE ROTORS AND ON THE NEXT BRAKE REPLACEMENT THE ROTORS MUST BE DISCARDED AND NEW ONES PURCHASED. IN ADDITION, IT IS A DANGEROUS CONDITION WHEREAS A SET OF ROTORS WHICH IS TURNED ONCE NOW IS BELOW THE MINIMUM DOT REQUIREMENT (.974) FOR THICKNESS. I HAVE SENT A NOTE VIA E-MAIL TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO THEIR CONSUMER ASSISTANCE CENTER, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS SITUATION HAS COME ABOUT. I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FRONT BRAKE ROTORS HAVE BEEN AN ALARMING ISSUE IN MY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR MY CAR. THIS SITUATION CONCERNS ME DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY WIFE ALONE USES THIS CAR, AND I AM NO LONGER SURE OF THE SAFETY OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM. IT IS MY PERSONAL THINKING THAT THE USE OF A SPECIFIC FRONT BRAKE PAD WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE ROTOR THICKNESS HAS CAUSED UNDUE AND EARLY ROTOR WEAR ON THIS SIZE AUTOMOBILE.
