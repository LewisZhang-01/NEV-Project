AS IS EVIDENT, I HAVE DRIVEN ONLY 53,000 MILES IN THE PAST 9 YEARS, WHICH IS MUCH BELOW THE AVERAGE OF 12,000 MILES DRIVEN PER YEAR. THIS CAR WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY FOR DOING GROCERIES AND DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP MY KIDS FROM SCHOOL. THIS IS OUR FAMILY CAR; WE DRIVE IT WITH UTMOST CARE AND GET IT SERVICED REGULARLY PER THE REQUIREMENTS.    I HAVE CALLED AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD. 1-800-999-1009 AND SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER MR. DARRELL HARVILLE. HE MENTIONED THAT IS A KNOWN DEFECT AND HONDA HAD ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS YEAR AND MODEL OF HONDA. HONDA ALSO ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE PERIOD OF 7 YEARS AND 9 MONTH OR 109,000 WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.    I CHECKED ON HONDA'S WEBSITE AND FOUND THAT MY VIN# IS IN THE RECALL LIST. I VALIDATED MY VIN# [XXX] ON HTTP://WWW.HONDATRANSMISSIONSETTLEMENT.COM/PHP/LOGIN.PHP WEBSITE AND GOT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE:  \"THIS VEHICLE IS COVERED UNDER THE SETTLEMENT. TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT, PLEASE READ THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION.\" HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY LETTERS OR EMAILS REGARDING THIS DEFECT AND RECALL.  SINCE MY CAR IS 9 YEARS OLD I AM LATE AND WOULD HAVE TO FIX TRANSMISSION AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I HAVE INQUIRED WITH A FEW HONDA DEALERS AND WAS TOLD THAT, IT WOULD COST ME MORE THAN $4000 TO FIX THIS DEFECT (TO FIX TRANSMISSION WITH FACTORY REBUILT ONE). THE $4000 COST TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION IS ALMOST HALF THE CURRENT PRICE OF MY CAR BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES.    I AM REQUESTING HONDA MOTOR CO. TO BEAR THE COST OF THIS DEFECT, AS THIS IS CLEARLY A FACTORY BUILD/ DESIGN ISSUE WHICH CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. HONDA MOTOR CO. NEEDS TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS ISSUE, AS I PAID FULL PRICE FOR A BRAND NEW CAR WITH TRANSMISSION DEFECTS.

DEEPER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT HONDA HAS MADE NO SIGNIFICANT DESIGN CHANGES TO THE TRANSMISSIONS THEY USED WHEN REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE ORIGINAL UNIT. THIS MEANS THAT THE SAME DESIGN INHERENT TO THE UNIT WAS PLACED BACK IN THE VEHICLE. DOING THIS MEANS THAT HONDA EFFECTIVELY PUT DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE BACK IN MY CAR.    IN NEARLY EVERY CASE I HAVE INVESTIGATED, THE 3RD CLUTCH PACK IS THE FAILURE MODE FOR THE TRANSMISSION. INVESTIGATION TURNED OUT SEVERAL REASONS THIS IS SUCH A COMMON FAILURE. THE THIRD CLUTCH PACK GETS STARVED FOR OIL AND HEAT BUILDUP IS NOT REMOVED FROM THE UNIT DUE TO POOR OIL FLOW. THE PATHS FOR OIL FLOW GET CLOGGED WITH DEBRIS AS THE TRANNY FAILS.    THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF 2000-2002 HONDA ODYSSEYS LIKE MINE WITH MULTIPLE FAILURES OF THE TRANSMISSION.

I HAD TO PUT MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND FIND MY WAY OUT TO THE SIDE LINE.  I WILL TELL YOU IT IS VERY SCARY TO START LOOSING POWER AND HAVING OTHERS CARS FULL SPEED BEHIND YOU. LUCKY ME I DIDN'T CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND NOBODY WAS HURT.   WHEN I STARTED LOOKING AT PRICES AND INFORMATION,  IN THE INTERNET I FOUND OUT THAT HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY EVEN LOST A LEGAL BATTLE IN 2006 FOR THE SAME REASONS. THEY KNOW THAT THIS 2001 HONDA ODYSSEY FALLS INTO THE BAD BATCH.    AT THAT TIME THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 109,000 AND 93 MONTHS.  MY VAN HAS 102,000 MILES BUT IS OUT OF THE 93 MONTHS.   MY QUESTION TO HONDA AND TO NHTSA, IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, ALSO YOU SHOULD AGREE THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD CAUSE SOME ACCIDENTS,  WHY WAIT UNTIL  SOMEBODY HAS AN ACCIDENT AND DIES.  WHY WAS THERE NEVER  A RECALL? TODAY I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY  OFFERED ME A DEAL, FROM 4K TO $3,000 (OH!  WHAT A DEAL- I COULD BUY ANOTHER 2001 VAN FOR JUST A LITTLE MORE). I CALLED AN INDEPENDENT AUTO REPAIR AND THEY WILL CHARGE ME $2,200 TO REPAIR THE TRANSMISSION, SO WHERE IS THE REAL DEAL FROM HONDA?.  ANOTHER QUESTION, CAN WE SUE HONDA AGAIN FOR NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM WHICH THEY ALREADY RECOGNIZED THEY HAD A PROBLEM BACK IN 2006 BUT DIDN'T DO A RECALL.  EVEN IF I FIX MY TRANSMISSION I HAVE BEEN READING THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR TRANSMISSION 3 TIMES IN 100,000 MILES.  FROM WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THE MONEY?

THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT RESULTED IN HONDA EXTENDING THE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY TO 100,000 MILES.

I CALLED THE DEALER, HE TOOK A LOOK AND DETERMINED IT WAS A TRANSMISSION OIL LEAK. HE ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST ME UP TO $4000 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND ADVISED ME TO KEEP THE FLUID TOPPED OFF AND THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE. ON 01-21-2010, MY VAN DID NOT START EVEN THOUGH THE BATTERY WAS WORKING. I HAD IT JUMP STARTED. TO PREVENT FURTHER SUCH ISSUES, I TOOK THE VAN TO AAMCO TO GET THE TRANSMISSION OIL LEAK EXAMINED. THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS FROM THE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION BOX AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE$600 TO OPEN THE TRANSMISSION AND FIX THE ISSUE. WHEN THEY OPENED THE TRANSMISSION THEY DISCOVERED THE TRANSMISSION BLOCK AND TRANSMISSION HAD SOME ISSUES AND DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPLACEMENT/ OR NEEDED TO BE REBUILT. THEY PROVIDED AN ESTIMATE OF $2300. I LOOKED UP THE HONDA WEBSITE AND DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH HONDA ODYSSEY VANS OF MY MODEL YEAR AND HONDA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION FOR THESE VANS TO 7 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS. I HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY MAILING TO THIS EFFECT FROM HONDA AND THIS WAS NEW INFORMATION TO ME. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING AS THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED - THEY WANT ME TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A HONDA DEALER TO GET THE TRANSMISSION EXAMINED - THEY WILL CONSIDER MY CLAIM AT THAT TIME. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE I WILL GET ANY REIMBURSEMENT FROM THEM. THE COST OF THE EXAMINATION AT THE DEALER WOULD BE OUT OF MY POCKET IN ADDITION TO THE $600 I HAVE ALREADY PAID TO AAMCO. QUESTION IS: HONDA KNOWS THERE IS A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION IN THIS MODEL YEAR, WHY ARE THEY NOT REPLACING IT?

I TOOK IT TO MY USUAL GARAGE (THE LIGHT WENT OFF ON THE WAY  THERE!) AND THEY SAID THE ONLY CODE THAT COME UP WAS P0172 FOR RICH FUEL, THEY PUT FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER IN THE GAS AND IT DROVE FINE--WHICH IT DOES WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT OFF. IN MAY, THE CAR 'S CEL WAS STILL SPORADICALLY COMING ON AND STALLING,AND I CALLED THE 800# FOR HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH A RIANO.  WHEN I TOLD HIM OF MY CAR'S SYMPTOMS AND ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY KNOWN PROBLEMS GOING ON OR RECALLS ABOUT THIS HE SAID \"NO\", AND TO JUST TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR A CHECK.  AS THE LIGHT WAS OFF AT THAT POINT AND WHAT I'D GONE THROUGH AT THE OTHER GARAGE I DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE LIGHT WAS ON.  ON JULY 20TH, I WAS SURFING THE INTERNET FOR SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THE DOT SITE WHICH MENTIONED THE EGR VALVE PROBLEM AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 8 YRS AND 80,000 MILES FOR REPLACEMENT BY HONDA.  MY  MILEAGE HAD JUST PASSED 80,000 THAT WEEKEND.  I CALLED THE 800# FOR HONDA AND SPOKE WITH A BRIAN WHO STATED THAT MY CAR HAD BEEN MADE JUNE 26, 2001 AND IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME TO BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY EXTENSION. I TOOK IT TO BILL PAGE HONDA IN FALLS CHURCH, VA, (CEL STILL OFF AT THIS TIME) , THEY SAID IT WAS THE EGR VALVE PLUS A THIRD PRESSURE SWITCH. IF I'D BEEN TOLD OF THE EGR PROBLEM IN MAY WHEN I ASKED RIANO I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN THEN AND BEEN WELL UNDER THE TIME AND MILEAGE FOR THE REPLACEMENT.  I FEEL THEY OWE ME THE $835.70 FOR REPAIRS AS THEY \"LIED BY OMISSION\".  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP IN THIS MATTER. *TR",

AFTER PARKED VEHICLE I FOUND ICE/SNOW BETWEEN THE WHEEL AND FENDER SKIRT.  I THOUGHT NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE ACCUMULATED ICE/SNOW, SO I REMOVE IT FROM VEHICLE.  WHEN I LEFT AFTER WORK, THE NOISE WAS STILL PRESENT.  I TURNED INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT AND DISCOVERED THE RIGHT SIDE FRONT SPRING WAS BROKEN AT THE LAST COIL AT BOTTOM OF THE SPRING.  BROKEN SPRING ONLY HAD ABOUT 1 TO 2 INCHES IN THE LOWER SPRING SEAT TO SUPPORT VEHICLE'S WEIGHT.  THE BROKEN PORTION WAS HANGED ON THE BROKEN SPRING.  THE NOISE WAS FROM THE BROKEN PORTION TOUCHING ROLLING WHEEL.  THE BROKEN SECTION WAS VERY SHARP WHICH POSED GREAT DANGER OF PIERCING, OR PUNCTURING THE TIRE.  WHEN I ASKED THE HONDA DEALER TO REPLACE THE SPRING, I WAS TOLD THE SHOCK ABSORBER WAS DAMAGED BY THE BROKEN SPRING.  CONSEQUENTLY THE STRUT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  FORTUNATELY I DROVE ON A LOCAL STREET AT A LOW SPEED THAT DAY.  HAD THE SPRING BROKEN WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, AT POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF 70 MPH, I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL, WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR HIGHWAY ACCIDENT, WITH POTENTIAL FOR FATALITIES.  A METALLURGIST TOOK A LOOK AT THE SPRING AND TOLD ME THE CAUSE WAS DUE TO CORROSION ACCELERATED PREMATURE FATIGUE FAILURE.  THE METALLURGIST ALSO INFORMED ME THAT HONDA HAS CHANGED SPRING DESIGN AFTER 2001 MODEL.  I CALLED HONDA NORTH AMERICA AND INFORMED THEM OF THE INCIDENT AND DEFECTIVE SPRING.  I BELIEVE THIS DEFECT THAT COULD GREATLY IMPAIR THE DRIVER'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE, IF IN FACT A TIRE IS PUNCTURED, OR STEERING IS IMPAIRED, DUE TO A BROKEN SPRING.   HONDA REFUSED TO ANALYZE THE FAILURE AND TOLD ME TO SCRAP, OR TO THROW AWAY, THE BROKEN SPRING.  I KEEP THE BROKEN SPRING IN MY POSSESSION.  IF NHTSA WOULD LIKE EXAMINE AND ANALYZE THE BROKEN SPRING, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF AN INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED, I WILL SEND IT TO YOU UPON YOUR REQUEST. *TR",

WHEN ATTEMPTING TO RE-ACCELERATE, THE ENGINE RPM'S INCREASED RAPIDLY BUT THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE.

LUCKILY THIS HAPPENS ON OUR DRIVEWAY INSTEAD OF HIGHWAY AT 65-75 MILES/HOUR!!! THANKS GOD IT HAPPENS AT HOME.    THE FACT: 2001 HONDA ODYSSEY WITH 75K MILES  - BOUGHT NEW IN 2001 IN CHICAGO IL. WE ARE THE ONLY OWNERS FROM DAY 1.  - MOVED TO OMAHA NE 2005  - NEVER IN AN ACCIDENT  - NEVER RAN OVER HUGE POT HOLE.  - NO TRAILER HITCH OR PULLING.  - 90% OF THE TIME DRIVING 4 KIDS TO SCHOOL AND SHOPPING.  - A FEW LONG-DISTANCE TRIPS OVER 800 MILES (HIGHWAY).  - ADMITTEDLY THE VAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE ''SNOW BELT'' OF ILLINOIS AND NEBRASKA AND THEREFORE SALT ON THE ROAD, BUT I WASHED THE ODYSSEY''S CHASSIS AND COIL SPRING EVERY SPRING TO CLEAN OUT THE SALT.    HERE IS MY OPINION: I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS AND VANS IN MY LIFE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT COIL SPRING WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL BUT THIS IS USUALLY SEEN IN CARS/VANS/PICK-UP TRUCKS OVER 15 YEARS OLD AND 180-200K MILES OR SO.  FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO A 2001 HONDA ODYSSEY VAN AT 6 YEARS AND 75K MILES IS PREMATURE AND MUST BE MANUFACTURING DEFECT OF SOME SORT.

ON DECEMBER 9, 2005 WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH THE DRIVER-SIDE SPRING OF MY ODYSSEY SUDDENLY FAILED AND BROKE INTO TWO PIECES. THIS CAUSED MY VAN''S STEERING TO IMMEDIATELY PULL HARD TO THE LEFT AND INTO THE OTHER LANE IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND NO OTHER DAMAGE OCCURRED TO MY VAN OR TO OTHERS. WE REPLACED THAT SPRING AT OUR EXPENSE AND VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE REMAINING SPRING SHOWED NOTHING UNUSUAL.

THEN THE CAR SUDDENLY SHIFTED SENDING US FORWARD UNEXPECTEDLY.  I DID NOT WANT TO CHANCE ANYTHING HAPPENING AND TOOK IT RIGHT INTO A TRANSMISSION PLACE.  THEY TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REBUILT OR REPLACED.  I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A NEW CAR AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE \"RELIABLE\" .  ALSO, I HAD ANOTHER CAR WHERE THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND THE EFFECTS WERE NOT SO SUDDEN AND FREIGHTENING!  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I BEGAN TO RESEARCH MY PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION.  I WAS EVEN MORE UPSET WHEN I CONTACTED HONDA AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL, ONLY A \"GOODWILL\" WARRANTY.  THEN THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WARRANTY BECAUSE MY CAR WAS INITALLY PURCHACED IN CANADA AND THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY.  SHE PROCEDED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WILL ONLY FIX THE CAR IF THE NHTSA TELLS THEM THEY HAVE TO ISSUE A RECALL.  I THOUGHT A HONDA WAS A HONDA.  I AM EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED IN READING OTHER ACCOUNTS WHERE REPLACED AND REBUILT TRANSMISSIONS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  *AK",

WHEN QUESTIONED THEY DENIED THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH ODYSSEY TRANSMISSIONS, ALTHOUGH THEY DID SAY THAT THEIR ODYSSEY SHUTTLEVAN (SAME YR/MODEL) HAD THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED THE PRIOR WEEK.  WHILE CONDUCTING A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET, WE FOUND DOZENS OF INSTANCES OF ODYSSEY TRANSMISSION FAILURES, ALL WITH REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION AS THE REMEDY.  WHILE IN OUR CASE THIS WAS DONE UNDER WARRANTY AT NO CHARGE, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT CAN EASILY LEAD TO A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  *AK",
