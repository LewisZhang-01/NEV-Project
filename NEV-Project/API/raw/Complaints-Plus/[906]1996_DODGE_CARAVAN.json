IF THESE PARTS ARE REPLACED AND THERE IS STILL SAME PROBLEM, WE NEED TO SUSPECT FUEL PUMP.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO HEAR FUEL PUMPING SOUND FOR ABOUT ONE SECOND EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING IF TURN THE KEY TO IGNITION POSITION.

WE HAVE HAD THE FUEL PUMP REPLACED TWICE; WE ARE NOW HAVING PROBLEMS WITH GASOLINE SMELL COMING FROM UNDER HOOD.  THE TIMING BELT JUST BROKE THIS WEEK. WE HAVE NUMEROUS OIL LEAKS; WE ARE AVERAGING 3-4 QUARTS OF OIL PER WEEK; WE HAD ONE MECHANIC PUT DYE IN THE OIL AND HE HAD US DRIVE IT FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN CHECKED IT AND STATED THERE WAS 4-5    OIL LEAKS AND WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF TO BUY A NEW CAR; AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS BY SEVERAL MECHANICS DUE TO THE MULTPLE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HAD.  WE HAVE ALSO HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH AIR CONDITIONER; AND THE SERPENTINE BELT BROKE SEVERAL TIMES UNDER WARRANTY AND JUST HAD TO REPLACE IT AGAIN THIS WEEK ALONG WITH THE TIMING BELT AND CAM SEALS.  WE HAD ABOUT 2 PAGES OF OF WARRANTY WORK DONE AND RIGHT AFTER WARRANTY RAN OUT IT WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE.  WE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE CLOCK SPRING AND 6 MONTHS LATER THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE CLOCK SPRING AND NOW I CANNOT FIND MY RECEIPT.  WE ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS VEHICLE AND IT HAS  MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE CAN COUNT AND WE VERY DISSAPPOINTED THAT WE PAID OVER $18000 FOR A VEHICLE AND HAD TO PUT APPROX MORE THAN $4000 IN UNNECCESARY REPAIRS THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL MECHANICS THAT THE TRANSMISSIONS IN THESE CARAVANS ARE JUNK AND THERE AER ALWAYS PROBLEMS WITH THEM AND THIS DOESNT SEEM VERY FAIR TO US AS CONSUMERS BECAUSE WE PUT OUT TRUST INTO DODGE/CHRYSLER CORP AND WE ENDED UP WITH A LEMON. LAST YEAR I SENT AN EMAIL TO CHRYLER AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEMS AND THEY BASICLY JUST BLEW US OFF, OF COURSE BECAUSE IT WASNT THERE PROBLEM NOW SINCE THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED, I WILL SAY THIS I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN.",

ALSO, MY AIRBAG LIGHT TURNED ON AND MY HORN STOPPED WORKING BECAUSE OF IT. SUDDENLY, ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO, THE CAR STARTED SMOKING. I TOOK IT TO GET IT SERVICED AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE SOURCE OF THE SMOKING. THE SERVICE MEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS BURNING OIL. I WAS TOLD BY OTHER MECHANICS, AFTER THE FIRE THAT I DESCRIBE BELOW, THAT IF THE VEHICLE BURNS OIL, THE SMOKE WOULD BE TEMPORARY, AND IT WOULD GO AWAY AFTER IT BURNS OFF. WELL... IT DIDN'T, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED:  ON APRIL 20TH, I PARKED MY CAR ON THE OUTDOOR PARKING LOT OF THE WHOLE FOODS MARKET, IN GLENDALE, CA. I HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE PA, THAT THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY IN THE SOUTH PARKING LOT, AND THAT EVERYONE THERE SHOULD MOVE THEIR CAR. I WAS PARKED IN THE SOUTH LOT. ON THE WAY OUT, A LADY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A CAR ON FIRE, AND THE FIRE DEPT WAS ON ITS WAY. I CONTINUED ON MY WAY OUTSIDE, AND WHEN I GOT TO THE PARKING LOT, I SAW THAT IT WAS MY VEHICLE. THE FIRE DID NOT BURN THROUGH THE FIREWALL, BUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE HOOD WAS DESTROYED.   THE FIRE DEPT FROM GLENDALE, SENT AN ARSON INVESTIGATOR, SINCE THE CAR WAS PARKED AND THERE HAD BEEN SOME CAR FIRES IN THE AREA. TURNS OUT, THE ARSON INVESTIGATOR TELLS ME, THAT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING ELECTRICAL. THE VAN DID NOT OVERHEAT. EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE, UNTIL THE THING CAUGHT FIRE ON SUNDAY. *JB",

EVENTUALLY, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF LATER, THE TRANSMISSIN FINALLY BROKE AND THEY HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE.  AFTER THAT THE CAR CONTINUED TO JERK VIOLENTLY WEHENEVER WE WERE GOING UP HILL AND AT 45 MPH.   WE KEPT BRING IN IT IN FOR THEM TO FIX IT, KNOWING THAT THIS MIGHT CREATE OTHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR, BUT THEY CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO FIX IT BECAUSE THE JERKING MOTION WAS NOT QUITE AS PRONOUNCED WHEN THEIR MECHANIC DROVE IT.  ACCORDING TO THEM, CHRISLER WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO SEE THE TRANSMISSION UNLESS IT JUSTIFIED IT BY BEING COMPLETELY OUT OF COMMISSION.  WE HAD THEM TRY TO SERVICE IT ONE MORE TIME, BUT INSTEAD, THEY TRIED TO FIX OTHER THINGS IN IT AND EVEN TRIED TO CHARGE ME FOR THEM.  I DID NOT PAY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FIX THE TRANSMISSION AND THE OTHER THINGS ADJUSTED HAD NO RELATION TO THE PROBLEM.  ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THIS SERVICE, I WOKE UP TO GO TO MY CONGREGATION WITH MY CHILDREN, WHEN MY CHILD INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR WAS BURNING.  I WENT TO LOOK CLOSELY AND AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SMALL CANDLE LIGHT.  I TOLD MY CHILDREN TO GO INSIDE THE HOUSE AS GAS FUMES COULD BE LEAKING AND THE CAR COULD EXPLODE.  I WENT UP TO CALL THE FIRE DEPT,WHICH TOOK ME ABOUT A MINUTE, AND BY THE TIME I GOT BACK, THE CAR WAS ALREADY ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  THIS OCCURRED, WITHOUT ANYONE TURNING ANYTHING ON, BE THAT IGNITION OR ELECTRICAL COMPONENT.  THIS IS EVIDENCE OF ONE OF TWO THINGS, THE MECHANIC AT FITZGERALD EITHER DELIVERATELY OR NEGLECTFULLY CREATED THE HAZARD WHEN HE LOOKED AND DID THE WRONG REPAIRS, OR THIS WAS A FACTORY DEFECT THAT FINALLY WAS ASCELERATED BY THE CONSTANT VIOLENT JERKING MOTION CREATED BY THE TRANSMISSION ONGOING MALFUNCTION,WHICH WENT ON FOR MORE THAN 3 YEARS.

I ASKED WHY I WAS HAVING THIS PROBLEM. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AN AIRBAG ONLY IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.  I BELIEVE IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT IT IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CARAVAN. BUT THEY SAID I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT. I TOLD THEM NOT TO TOUCH IT THAT I WANTED TO CONTACT CHRYSLER WHICH I DID, AND WAS TOLD TO SHOP AROUND TO OTHER DEALERS FOR CHEAPER PRICE.  I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND I BELIEVE NO AIRBAGS IN MY MINIVAN.

WE GOT THERE AND 50MILES INTO THE RETURN TRIP I WAS ON THE PA TURNPIKE WHEN I HEARD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SIREN.  WE LOOKED AROUND AND SAW NO FLASHING LIGHTS.  WE STARTED UP AN INCLINE AND THE CAR STARTED TO SLOW DOWN.  AS IT DID, THE SOUND OF THE SIREN ALSO STARTED TO DEMINISH AND I REALIZED THAT THE SIREN WE HEARD WAS COMING FROM MY CAR.  WE WERE 100 MILES AWAY FROM HOME AND HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED BACK TO PHILADELPHIA.  IT WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE MECHANIC WHO I PAID FOR THE REPAIRS, AND AFTER HE HAD TIME TO CHECK THE PROBLEM OUT, I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD COST ME $1,200.00.

I DO NOT SEE THE JUSTICE IN HAVING TO PAY FOR A BRAND NEW CAR, ONLY TO HAVE SUCH A MAJOR COMPONENT GIVE AFTER ONLY 3 YEARS ON THE ROAD.  FOR THAT, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN MY CHANCES WITH A USED CAR.  MY MECHANIC INFORMS ME THAT HE HAS SEEN NUMEROUS DODGE VEHICLES COME INTO HIS SHOP WITH TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  HE TOLD ME THAT THERE IS A BAND IN THE TRANSMISSION THAT SNAPPED, AND HE HAS SEEN THIS SORT OF PROBLEM ON OTHER OCCASIONS WITH DODGE PRODUCTS.  THIS IS MY SECOND TIME CONTACTING YOU REGARDING THIS PROBLEM, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE.  THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER FROM THIS SORT OF THING.

WHEN COMING TO A STOP OR APPLYING MY BRAKES, A CRUNCHING SOUND OCCURS ,AND I CAN FEEL IT IN THE PEDAL.  IT IS A FAIRLY LOUD SOUND AND THE VIBRATION IS DISTRACTING BECAUSE YOU LOSE YOUR BRAKE PEDAL FOR A PERIOD OF 1-2 SECONDS.  I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER DODGE CARAVAN OWNERS AND PLAN TO TAKE A DETAILED SURVEY ON THIS MATTER, BUT, NONE TO THIS POINT HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM OR ANTILOCK BRAKE COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH IS UNDETECTABLE.  THIS DOES NOT OCCUR ALL THE TIME, AND NOT UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS.  THIS, ALSO, LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THERE IS A MAJOR SAFTEY DEFECT HERE.  I HAVE HAD THIS TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAY THEY CANT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, GET IN AN ACCIDENT?  I HAVE ASKED THAT THEY RECALL MY VAN, REFUND FULL PURCHASE PRICE OR REPLACE MY VEHICLE WITH ONE SIMILAR TO MINE.
