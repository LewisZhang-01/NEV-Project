WHILE TOWING FROM KENTUCKY BACK TO NY, I NOTICED MY REAR AXLE NOT TRACKING PROPERLY IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR.  I PULLED INTO AN INTERSTATE REST STOP AND FOUND THAT THE REAR SPRING BOLT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR AXLE HAD BROKEN.  IT WAS REPAIRED TEMPORARILY TO GET ME HOME AND I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER.  THEY REPLACED IT WITH THE PROPER PARTS.  IT IS A CORRECT TRACK SUSPENSION MANUFACTURED BY LIPPERT.  THIS FALL BEFORE PUTTING THE CAMPER AWAY FOR THE WINTER, I CHECKED ALL OF THE BOLTS AND THE ONE THAT WAS JUST REPLACED IN JULY WAS ONLY FINGER TIGHT.  THERE IS AN OBVIOUS ISSUE WITH THIS SUSPENSION AND FORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS.  I AM CONCERNED WITH WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THOSE NOT WATCHING THEIR LOADS LIKE I DO.  I CONTACTED LIPPERT TWICE AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE AND HAVE PICTURES OF THE ISSUE.  SPEAKING WITH THE MECHANIC WHO ASSISTED ME AT ROAD SIDE SAID THAT HE HAS ABOUT 4 OF THOSE ISSUES EACH WEEK AND HAD ANOTHER CALL FOR THE SAME ISSUE WHILE REPAIRING MINE.  CAN YOU PLEASE HELP US AND EVERYONE ELSE WITH THIS SUSPENSION TO GET LIPPERT TO CORRECT THIS?  ROADSIDE REPAIRS WERE NECESSARY AND EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  ATTACHED ARE PHOTOS OF THE DAMAGE AND WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE.  THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT THE NUT FROM LOOSENING.  IT IS NOT A LOCKING NUT, NOR DOES IT HAVE ANY TYPE OF RETAINER.

A LOT OF DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE TO THE RV AND WE REQUESTED THAT UNICORN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  1) THEY REQUESTED THE TIRES BE RETURNED TO THEM FOR INSPECTION - WE DID. 2) REQUESTED 2 ESTIMATES.  ONE FOR $19,716.83 & $21,096.88 - WE SUBMITTED. ONE FROM PURCHASING DEALER & ONE FROM ANOTHER LOCAL DEALER. 3) PHOTOS-100+ SENT OF DAMAGES INSIDE AND OUT & TIRES. 4) DETAILED EXPLANATION. SENT 5)TIRE RECEIPTS FROM REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE TIRES. SENT.  AFTER THEY REC'D THE TIRES THEY DETERMINED FAULT BEING TREAD SEPARATION.  DIRECTLY AFTER THAT THEY SENT AN EMAIL STATING THEIR POLICY HAD CHANGED AND WE WOULD HAVE TO FILE WITH OUR INSURANCE AND HAVE THEM SUBROGATE.   THE COPY OF THE \"POLICY\" IS A THREE SENTENCE JOKE.  THEY OFFERED A SETTLEMENT OF $5,000 AND WANTED A RELEASE AGREEMENT SIGNED.  WE DID NOT.  WE FEEL THAT THEY HAVE ADMITTED FAULT HOWEVER ARE NOT TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE MALFUNCTIONING TIRES CAUSED.  LUCKILY MY HUSBAND GOT THE RV UNDER CONTROL AND NO INJURIES HAPPENED.
