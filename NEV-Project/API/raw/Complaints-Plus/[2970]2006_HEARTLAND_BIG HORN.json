UPDATED 04/25/11  *BF  THE UNIT JUST TURNED 5 YEARS OLD.  I AM THE SECOND OWNER.  BOUGHT USED IN 2008, PULLED LESS THAN 10,000 MILES.  UPON ARRIVING HOME LAST TRIP, (400 MILES ROUND TRIP),  I FOUND MY LEAF SPRING SHACKLE LINKS, WHICH HOLD THE LEAF SPRING AND IN TURN HOLD THE AXLE IN PLACE HAD RIPPED LOOSE ON BOTH SIDES OF MY SUSPENSION.  IN ESSENCE, THE ONLY THING HOLDING THE AXLE IN PLACE WAS THE REAR LEAF SPRING BOLTS.   THE FRONT PART OF THE LEAF SPRING WHICH WAS NOW LOOSE JUST SO HAPPENED TO REST AGAINST THE TRAILER FRAME PREVENTING A CATASTROPHIC  FAILURE, (WRECK!)  I CALLED THE RV MANUFACTURER, (HEARTLAND RV), AND THE SUSPENSION MANUFACTURER, (AL-KO KOBER), AND DISCUSSED THIS WITH BOTH. THEY PUT ME OFF BY STATING THEY ONLY GIVE A 1 YEAR WARRANTY ON THE UNIT.  I HAVE DRIVEN AUTOMOBILES WITH LEAF SPRINGS FOR 200,000 MILES ACROSS EVERY KIND OF ROAD WITH NO REAR LEAF SPRING SUSPENSION INCIDENT.  AM I TO EXPECT AXLE, LEAF SPRING FRACTURES EVERY 4-5 YEARS?  THE LEAF SPRING BUSHINGS ARE DAMAGED OR ENTIRELY GONE.  THE BOLTS ARE WORN BAD AS WELL.  I WOULD THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO LAST MUCH LONGER THAN 5 YEARS AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN THE ESTIMATED 20,000 MILES. COMMON SENSE STATES THAT THE  AXLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED AT LEAST  7, 000 LB RATING.  YOU CAN SEE THE DANGER OF PULLING THIS DOWN THE ROAD AND HAVING AN AXLE FALL OUT.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO EVER HAPPEN!    I CAN SEND PICTURES!  JUST BECAUSE THERE WERE NO INJURIES, DOESN'T MEAN THIS SHOULD NOT BE ADDRESSED!!
