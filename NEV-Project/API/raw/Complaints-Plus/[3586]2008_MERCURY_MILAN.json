        "summary": "RE: NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V904000  Manufacturer Ford Motor Company  Components SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC  Vehicle regarding complaint: 2008 Mercury Milan Vehicle Vin: [XXX]   Good day,   In September of 2021 I took the above mentioned vehicle in for the above stated recall regarding the Hydraulic control unit. The vehicle was taken to Westlie Motor Company 500 S Broadway Minot, ND 58701 (701) 852-1354.    The vehicle was tested and did in fact fail the test and I was informed the replacement part would be ordered promptly. After two months of no calls from the dealership I stopped in and was told they had no idea about the part. I was assured it would be looked in to. The first week of December I was called and requested the vehicle be brought in for the recall service. I took the vehicle in December 6th and after two hours was notified service was finished. Upon driving home I immediately noticed the problem had not been fixed. I returned to the dealership upon inspecting the vehicle having noticed the NO obvious repairs had been done. Demanding explanation I was told that it was a miscommunication and recall work had not been done. Only a brake flush and cap replacement. I was then again told that they were not sure where the part was or when it would arrive. I then escalated a complaint to Ford motor company ( 1-866-631-3788) Case # [XXX]. I was assure Ford would call the company and inform me intermediately as to the situation and a solution. I received no call back and I again phoned in January with the same result. I was told they would look into it and call me back. I again called today Feb 1st and spoke with Ford and was told the same thing with no solution given. I have been dealing with this recall for nearly 6 months. As per your website states, a company or manufacturer must fix or offer a solution in a reasonable time period. I feel 6 months is long enough to find a part. Please help. I want my car safe for my family.    INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

WE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND CALLED OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER.  UPON INSPECTION, THEY AGREED IT SOUNDED LIKE THE RECALL PROBLEM.  BUT, IT WAS STILL AN ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE RECALL AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX IT, IT MAY BE UNTIL LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  SO, HERE WE ARE, OVER A MONTH LATER, CAR STILL SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY, NOT ABLE TO BE DRIVEN.  I AM BEYOND FRUSTRATED, NO ONE CAN SUPPOSEDLY DO ANYTHING.

I HAD SUFFICIENT BRAKING, PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, TO ROLL TO A STOP. POPPING THE HOOD, I FOUND THE CAP ON THE BRAKES FLUID RESERVOIR WAS AJAR. I REFITTED IT AND FOUND THAT THE BRAKES WORKED NORMALLY. (IN RETROSPECT, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A \"FAILURE\" OCCURRED IN THE RESERVOIR CAP, BUT WAS INSTEAD A CONSEQUENCE OF OTHER MALFUNCTIONS IN THE SYSTEM. SOME TIME LATER, I HAD ANOTHER FAILURE, WHICH NEARLY RESULTED IN A CRASH. I LIMPED TO GARNET FORD, AND HAD REPAIRS DONE, TOTALING ABOUT $1200. THE CAUTIONARY I RECEIVED FROM THE SERVICE REP WAS FOREBODING: REPLACEMENT OF THE MASTER CYLINDER MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY THEN CLAIMED THAT THE REPAIR WAS SUFFICIENT. (IN RETROSPECT, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE LEAST TAKING THIS ACTION THEN AND THERE: AN AUTOMOBILE WITH ONLY 35,000 MILES ON IT  OUGHT NOT HAVE DANGEROUS AND DEFECTIVE BRAKES). LAST MONTH I HAD TO HAVE BRAKES REPAIRED, AS A RESULT OF PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM MY WIFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE, AND EXPERIENCING MUCH THE SAME THING AS HAD OCCURRED TO ME THE FIRST INCIDENT. FRONT ROTORS AND PADS WERE SERVICED, BUT THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. NOW MY ABS WARNING LIGHT IS INTERMITTENTLY ON, AND I AM GETTING A ROUGHNESS TO BRAKING AS IF THE FRONT BRAKES ARE WORN DOWN: THEY ARE NOT. I AM RETURNING TO THE MECHANIC WITH THIS PROBLEM.

THIS HAS OCCURRED FOUR TIMES NOW, TWICE WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR, AND THE LAST TIME NEARLY HAD ME GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 55-60 MPH, THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME HAD TO BRAKE SUDDENLY DUE TO A MERGE IN FRONT OF THEM. I HIT THE BRAKES AS NORMAL, ABOUT 50% PEDAL DEPRESSION, AND THE CAR STARTED BRAKING NORMALLY UNTIL IT PASSED OVER A SMALL PATCH OF LOOSE GRAVEL ON THE FREEWAY, AT WHICH POINT THE PEDAL SANK TO THE GROUND AND THE VEHICLE NO LONGER PROCEEDED TO SLOW DOWN. I HAD TO VEER TO THE LEFT, NEARLY COLLIDING WITH THE CENTER MEDIAN AND ENDED UP PASSING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE OF THE BRAKING DISTANCE INCREASING. I HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE LOOKED INTO AND EVEN A TECH AT THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP SAYS THAT IT IS A FAULTY ABS HCU (HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT), AND THAT THE VALVES STICKING IN THE HCU CAUSE THE PRESSURE TO GO INTO A SEMI-INFINITE LOOP INSTEAD OF EXITING OUT BACK TO THE CALIPERS. THIS CAUSES AROUND 80% OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO BE WASTED, AND BRAKING REQUIRES DEPRESSING THE PEDAL NEARLY TO THE FLOOR. THE TECH ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE NEW HCUS AVAILABLE THAT DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND THERE IS A POTENTIAL RECALL PENDING. THE TECH INSTRUCTED ME TO REMOVE THE ABS FUSE AS WELL AS THE ABS PUMP FUSE, WHICH STOPS THE PROBLEM FROM HAPPENING. I HAVE CONFIRMED AFTER 10,000 MILES THAT WITH THE ABS FUSES OUT, THE PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR.

I ASKED SPECIFICALLY, \"SO YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT THERE IS NO WAY YOU ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE PART AT THIS TIME TO MAKE THE REPAIR NEEDED TO MAKE THIS VEHICLE SAFE?\" THE SERVICE PERSON REPLIED THAT WAS CORRECT, THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.  I AGAIN RESTATED, \"SO I AM JUST SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE DRIVING AROUND WITH AIRBAGS FULL OF SHRAPNEL?\" HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS SORRY.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS RESPONSE AND COMPLETE LACK OF REMEDIAL OPTIONS IS DANGEROUS AND UNACCEPTABLE.  IT IS PREPOSTEROUS THAT LIVES CONTINUE TO BE AT STAKE DUE TO A LACK OF PARTS, THAT THIS FACT IS WELL DOCUMENTED (SEE WWW.SAFERCAR.GOV) AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO FORCE THE COMPANY'S HAND, WHILE IN THE MEANTIME THEY ARE CONVENIENTLY ABLE TO MAKE USE OF THE NATION'S BANKRUPTCY COURTS TO FURTHER MITIGATE THEIR LOSSES. IN WHAT WAY IS THE CONSUMER BEING PROTECTED HERE? WHAT IS THE POINT OF A RECALL IF THE CONSUMER IS UNABLE TO RID HIMSELF OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT? OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS FLAW IN THIS SYSTEM, AS THE PROTECTION I AM RECEIVING IS VIRTUALLY NIL. AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN A RECALL PRIOR TO THIS, I HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THE POSSIBLY MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT THIS WAS A VALID AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM. I AM HOPING TO SEE THE PROOF.",

IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS FOR BRAKES TO RETURN TO NORMAL.  THE SECOND TIME, I SLAMMED ON MY BRAKES WHEN TRAFFIC CAME TO AN IMMEDIATE HALT.  I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP, BUT AGAIN WHEN THE ANTILOCK BRAKES WERE ACTIVATED, I LOST PEDAL AND HAD TO GO INTO THE MEDIAN TO AVOID REAR-ENDING THE CAR IN FROM OF ME.  AGAIN, SEVERAL HOURS LATER THE BRAKES RETURNED TO NORMAL.  I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SIMILAR SCENARIO TO SHOW MY HUSBAND JUST BY SLAMMING ON MY BRAKES AT THE END OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SAND LAID ON THE ASPHALT.  HE BLED THE BRAKES AND THE PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE RESOLVED, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT.  THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED, MY 19 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING IT.  SHE LOST PEDAL AFTER ANTILOCK BRAKES WERE ACTIVATED AND, BEING A NEW DRIVER, CLIPPED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF HER.  FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT AND WE WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE THE ACCIDENT WITHOUT INVOLVING AUTHORITIES.  AFTER THIS I HAVE NOT ALLOWED HER TO DRIVE THE CAR AND IT SITS IN THE GARAGE AS WE DEBATE FIXING THE COSMETIC DAMAGE DUE TO THE BRAKE PROBLEMS.

I HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW TIRE WHILE IN OHIO AND ALSO PURCHASED A WARRANTY (LIFETIME) ON ALL THE OTHER MICHELIN TIRES.

I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN ONE RECALL AND THREE SERVICE BULLETINS ISSUED FOR THIS VEHICLE.   ONE OF THEM INVOLVES THE TIRES.   MY VEHICLE NOW HAS 32,000 MILES ON IT AND I AM TOLD I WILL BE NEEDING NEW TIRES SHORTLY.   HOW COULD THIS BE?   I'VE NEVER HAD A VEHICLE THAT I ONLY GOT 32,000 MILES OUT OF THE ORIGINAL SET OF TIRES.   I'M NOW SUSPECTING THAT ITS POSSIBLE THE TIRES ARE LEAKING AIR DUE TO THE VALVE STEM ON THE TIRE ITSELF.   I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY I'VE NEVER RECEIVED ANY BULLETINS OR NOTIFICATIONS ON RECALLS.   THE PROBLEM LIES EITHER WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THE VEHICLE PUTTING POOR QUALITY TIRES ON THE VEHICLE OR WITH THE TIRE MANUFACTURER.   I'M ON DISABILITY AND CANNOT AFFORD NEW TIRES.   THE CAR HAS ONLY 32,000 MILES ON IT & IS DRIVEN GENTLY.   I CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE BUYING MICHELIN TIRES EVER.  ONE OTHER THING, 2 OF THE WHEELS HAD CORROSION GROUND OFF THEM IN HOPES THAT THE TIRE WOULD FIT BETTER, HOWEVER, THIS HAS NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  WHERE DOES THE PROBLEM LIE?   I WAS TOLD BY DISCOUNT TIRE THAT IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF ECONOMICS THAT MANUFACTURERS MADE THE DECISION THAT IT'S \"QUANTITY OVER QUALITY\" WHEN PUTTING TIRES ON NEW CARS.   IN OTHER WORDS POOR QUALITY TIRES ARE PUT ON NEW CARS??   APPARENTLY, THIS IS THE CASE WHEN ONE NEEDS TO BUY NEW TIRES AT ONLY 32,000 MILES.",

I DISCOVERED A BUBBLE IN THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE AND HAD TO THROW THE TIRE AWAY WITH ONLY 8700 MILES ON IT. I CONTACTED MICHELIN AND INQUIRED ABOUT THESE \"50\" SERIES SIDEWALL CONFIGURATION TIRES HAVING THIS PROBLEM AS TOLD TO ME BY MY TIRE DEALER. THEY AGREED WITH THEIR DEALER THAT THESE TIRES CAN'T TAKE POTHOLES AND WOULD BUBBLE ON THE SIDEWALL AND COULD BLOWOUT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS!! THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO CONTROL WHERE THE CAR MANUFACTURERS SELL THEIR CARS WITH THESE TYPE OF TIRES INSTALLED ON THEM. THIS PROBLEM EXISTS ON ALL \"50\" SIDEWALL CONFIGURATION TIRES SOLD BY ALL TIRE MANUFACTURERS. I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY, THE POTHOLE CAPITOL OF THE USA! THESE TIRES ARE DANGEROUS, IF A BUBBLE APPEARS ON THE INNER SIDEWALL WHERE IT CAN'T BE SEEN AND REPLACED, IT COULD BLOWOUT AT HIGH SPEED. I HAVE RECEIVED A COURTESY REIMBURSEMENT OF 50% FROM MICHELIN. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT I CANNOT CHANGE THESE TIRES AND HAVE A \"55\" SIDEWALL CONFIGURATION TIRE INSTALLED BECAUSE THE FACTORY ABS AND TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS WILL MALFUNCTION!!! I HAVE SENT A LETTER TO FORD/MERCURY ENGINEERING DIVISION  TO REQUEST THEIR HELP IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF THESE SENSORS MALFUNCTIONING UPON REPLACING THESE \"50\" SIDEWALL TIRES WITH \"55\"S AS OF THIS WRITING, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY. I HAVE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS TIRE/REPAIR FACILITY FOR 40 YEARS AND THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM EXISTING WITH ALL MANUFACTURERS \"50\" SIDEWALL CONFIGURATION, AND I TRUST THEM. I BELIEVE THESE TIRES SHOULD BE OFFERED AS AN OPTION ONLY IN THE NORTHEAST WITH A WARNING ABOUT THE POTHOLE DAMAGE. THEY WERE STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON MY MILAN...A 149 MILE PER HOUR TIRE ON A 4 CYLINDER SEDAN!!!! I WANT THE CAR MANUFACTURERS TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY AT THEIR EXPENSE TO CORRECT THE SENSOR MALFUNCTIONS IF THIS \"50\" TIRE IS REPLACED WITH ONE OF A HIGHER SIDEWALL. *TR",
