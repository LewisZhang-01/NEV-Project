        "summary": "My wife's older car needed a new engine, so we decided on buying a new car since her work requires a good deal of driving.  One week after the purchase, we discovered there was no spare tire!  This IS a major safety issue, and although the car has many good safety features, this lack is really frightening. I read that AAA begged car makers NOT to get rid of this, but the brand we bought has had this at least since 2017. This affects all those who can LEAST afford it, since the more expensive larger cars mainly have spare tires.   Why hasn't this been a bigger issue?  Other popular competitive makes still have the spare, and if we had known this problem we likely would have gone to another make, although our choices are limited.  I can't believe that this has been going on with this car model since at least 2017 and that more people haven't complained.",

        "summary": "KIA FORTE 2022 Complaints A/C isn't working KIA FORTE 2022 AC condenser  we just bought a *New Black 2022 KIA FORTE FE/L on 09 Nov 2021 already having problems the AC stopped working so we took it to the KIA Dealership in Katy when it happens the parts dept. the supervisor says it has no Freon in it and it was safe to drive home and it was a Structural Design Flaw that caused the problem.  So we took it to where we bought it to get it checkout they claim it was due to a HOLE IN THE CONDENSER, NOT WARRANTY RECOMMEND TO REPLACE CONDENSER Estimated PARTS, AND LABOR IS $1,351.13+ TAX.  Kia dealership won't fix it unless we pay $1300 ++++ saying it's not covered under the warranty it's a brand new car parts manager in another Kia Dealership says it was caused by a Structural Design Flaw but the KIA Dealership where we bought the car says we have to pay to get it fixed.  They claim a little rock or something from the road caused the damage however there is no way for a little rock to reach the AC condenser from the bottom.  As you can see in the pictures the bottom is covered by a shield to prevent anything from getting in.  If anything got in it's due to a Structural Design Flaw due to the opening in the bumper design where there is an opening just below where they claim the damage is.  I took picture of the car before taking it to the shop and the picture they sent us looks like a different vehicle. There was no residue or anything to show it was a leak.  Then they had the nerve to charge me $132.69 to get my car back the receipt says labor $50.00 Parts $90.00 what parts did they replace? It\u2019s still broken. Then they even charged me tax on this  Is this how they treat customers who have bought several cars from them I hope someone gets their act together and do what\u2019s right and fix our car and refund me the $132.69 and fix the problem so it won\u2019t happen again.",
