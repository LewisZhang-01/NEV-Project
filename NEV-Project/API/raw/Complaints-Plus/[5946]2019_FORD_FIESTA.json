I visited an auto parts store for a scanner and that was the code:  Transmission friction PO7A3x2.  Here I send you some news, ford, ford defects on your focus and fiesta vehicles.  http://www.fordtransmissionproblems.com/fords-transmission-problem  Ford's PowerShift dual-clutch transmission was used in 2010. Affected vehicles are the Ford Fiesta (model years 2011-2016) and Ford Focus (model years 2012-2016) equipped with a PowerShift transmission.  The PowerShift transmission is basically a manual transmission electronically controlled by a computer while using a 'dry clutch' rather than a 'wet clutch', which means that no oil is supplied to the shift mechanism and can result in increased wear to as problems persist. When the computer module used to operate the transmission cannot handle rapid acceleration or gear changes, the vehicle sputters and creates an audible noise. The vehicle may also experience downshifting issues, which means the vehicle will stay in a higher gear despite deceleration and jerk will result.  However, this is not just a matter of convenience or comfort. When accelerating quickly through an intersection, the delay can be dangerous as it prevents the vehicle from reaching the same speed as it would with an automatic transmission. When it comes to decelerating, the inability of the car to downshift properly can cause the vehicle to roll forward, even when the brakes are applied, posing a safety hazard in many circumstances. This is all a safety hazard",
