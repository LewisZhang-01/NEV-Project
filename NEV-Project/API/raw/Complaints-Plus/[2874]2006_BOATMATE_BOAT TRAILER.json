I WAS TOLD BY THE MANUFACTURER (UFP, UNIQUE FUNCTIONAL PRODUCTS, HTTP://WWW.UFPNET.COM/) THAT THIS VINTAGE AXLE IS KNOWN BY THEM TO HAVE FAILURES OF THE GLUE JOINT BETWEEN THE TORSION SHAFT AND THE INTERNAL RUBBER BLOCK. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THE FAILURE MIGHT OCCUR. MY TRAILER WAS NOT SUBJECTED TO ANY UNUSUAL OPERATING CONDITIONS, EXTREME USAGE, OR TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS.     THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SUDDEN STOPPING OF WHEEL/TIRE ROTATION COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.    I BELIEVE THAT THIS POSES A HAZARD TO ANY CONSUMERS STILL USING THIS TYPE OF AXLE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE RECALLED.    THE FAILED AXLE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER. I CAN RETAIN THE AXLE FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME IN CASE THE NHTSA WISHES TO EXAMINE IT.  *TR",
