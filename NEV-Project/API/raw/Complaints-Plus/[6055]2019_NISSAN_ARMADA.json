SUV is available for inspection I have possession as of 1/22/22 picked up from Nissan dealership.  I pulled in the her driveway  then I backed up so I would be half on the driveway and half on grass in the event her or her husband needed to leave Backed up the car and soon as I put the car in drive the car accelerated on its own. I pushed my foot on the brake pedal as hard as I could would not stop till it hit my daughters car which then shoved her new car through her garage door. A warning message came up on the screen stating SONAR Malfunction as this was all going on. There was a police report filed that same day. Car was taken to Nissan Dealership  We were told to leave the car and contact Nissan Consumer hotline. I called they said they would assign someone to the case and they would call me. The first contact from the Nissan Consumer hotline case manager was1/3/2022. This person was very hard to reach. Called me and Stated inspection would be done in a couple  weeks she would contact me when she had a date. She calls me the same day they were doing the inspection. Then called me back on 1/21/2022 to inform me the inspection results were in. Stated they could find anything wrong and were unable to duplicate. When I went to pick up my Nissan SUV we were handed a paper from the inspection did not have any details regarding the test. What did they do to come to the conclusion there is nothing wrong? They code is gone that came up when car was accelerating (sonar malfunction) . They told us the car is safe to drive. I have had so much anxiety about driving period since this incident. Since Nissan stated it\u2019s safe to drive my husband said he would we have no choice  The day Nissan called back to inform us of that we\u2019re be a scheduled inspection. I called back forgot to ask a few questions . Is the car safe we can drive this was before inspection results no return call.",
