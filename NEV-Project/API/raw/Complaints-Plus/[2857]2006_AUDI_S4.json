THE SPECIFIC SCENARIO:  I WILL START MY CAR.  BOTH OF THE HEADLIGHTS INITIALLY SEEM TO BE OPERATING PROPERLY.  WITHIN A MINUTE, ONE OR BOTH OF THE HEADLIGHTS WILL BEGIN TO FLICKER, AND ONE OR BOTH OF THEM WILL FAIL, CAUSING A \"HEADLIGHT DIPPED\" WARNING ON MY DASHBOARD. THE ISSUE OFTEN OCCURS DURING BRAKING, ACCELERATION OR WHEN THE CAR GOES OVER A BUMP.  THE ISSUE MAY OCCUR WITH EITHER THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT OR BOTH LIGHTS, RESULTING IN A SEVERELY UNSAFE CONDITION.  RESTARTING THE CAR WILL CURE THE PROBLEM BUT IT OFTEN REOCCURS UNTIL THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES.  THIS ISSUE OCCURS ALMOST EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON, USUALLY EVERY DAY, OR AT LEAST SEVERAL TIMES PER WEEK.  MOISTURE (RAIN/CAR WASH) DOES NOT SEEM TO MAKE THE ISSUE WORSE.  AUDI OF AMERICA IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND HAS ISSUED SEVERAL TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ABOUT THE ISSUE, BUT WILL NOT PAY FOR REPAIRS UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS UNDER WARRANTY.  AUDI HAS NOT IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC REPAIR TECHNIQUE THAT WILL DEFINITELY FIX THE ISSUE.  THE REPAIR ATTEMPTS INCLUDE REPLACING THE LIGHT BULBS, REPLACING THE HID BALLASTS AND/OR CONTROL MODULES, AND INSTALLING SHIMS AROUND THE LIGHT HOUSINGS TO QUELL THE VIBRATION THAT MAY BE A CAUSE OF THE ISSUE.  IT IS A TRIAL-AND-ERROR REPAIR PROCESS AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  *TR",
