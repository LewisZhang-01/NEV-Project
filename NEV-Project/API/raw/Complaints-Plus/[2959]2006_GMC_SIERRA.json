ON OUR WAY HOME  WE WERE NO LONGER HAULING THE CAMPER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR REPAIR. I THANK GOD FOR THIS BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE  WERE HAULING THE CAMPER ON THE INTERSTATE AND THE BRAKE LINE WOULD HAVE BROKEN THEN. WHEN WE WERE ALMOST HOME I FELT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE BRAKES. I HAD TO PRESS THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR TO GET MY VEHICLE TO STOP. I WAS CLOSE TO A ADVANCED AUTO SO I DROVE VERY SLOWLY AND STAYED FAR FROM VEHICLES SO THAT I COULD MAKE IT THERE FOR THEM LOOK TO SEE IF I WAS LOW ON FLUID. BUT WHEN I TURNED INTO THEIR PARKING LOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER I PUT ON THE BRAKES TO PARK IT THE BRAKE LINE BROKE. I HAD TO HAVE MY VEHICLE TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD TO HAVE REPAIRS DONE. NOT ONLY THE BRAKE LINES WERE CHANGED BUT THE CALIPERS ALSO. THE BILL WAS JUST UNDER 5 THOUSAND DOLLARS. I CALLED GMC ALL THEY DID WAS CALL THE DEALERSHIP TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS DONE. WHICH WAS NO HELP TO ME. I COULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THAT MYSELF. I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT INJUSTICE TO GMC OWNERS THAT THEY KNOW OF A SITUATION AND WOULD LET US USE THESE VEHICLES TO HAUL OUR CHILDREN ON CAMPING TRIPS PUTTING THEIR SAFETY IN DANGER. I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER GMC VEHICLE. ALSO MY EXTENDED WARRANTY ENDED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE. ALTHOUGH I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT HAVE COVERED IT . I ALSO BRING MY VEHICLE FOR OIL CHANGES AS REQUIRED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH THEY DO CHECK OTHER THINGS AS A ROUTINE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THESE AUTO REPAIRMEN DIDN'T CATCH THIS .  THERE IS NO REASON THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THIS VEHICLE. .. WHEN YOUR BRAKES GO OUT YOU LOOKING AT A MAJOR DANGER TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS.  *TR",

IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I HAD TO PRESS WITH FULL FORCE TO STOP.  DROVE SLOWLY TO NEAREST GMC DEALER, NOT FAR AWAY.  ALMOST ALL OF THE BRAKE PEDAL TRAVEL PROVIDED NO RESPONSE; THE REMAINDER OF TRAVEL WAS SOFT AND PROVIDED MINIMAL BRAKING PERFORMANCE.  DIAGNOSIS BY THE DEALER WAS EXCESSIVE CORROSION ON ALL SOLID BRAKE LINES AND FITTINGS.  BURST/LEAKAGE ON A LINE NEAR THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR WHEEL WAS CAUSING THE SOFT, NEARLY UNRESPONSIVE BRAKE PEDAL.  RECOMMENDATION BY DEALER WAS TO REPLACE ALL SOLID BRAKE LINES AND FITTINGS, FROM MASTER CYLINDER TO ABS UNIT TO EACH WHEEL END.  I WAS TOLD THAT ONLY FIXING THE AREA THAT HAD BURST WOULD BE TOO \"RISKY\" DUE TO CONDITION OF THE REST OF THE SOLID BRAKE LINES AND THAT FAILURE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE LINES WAS \"PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN.\"  THE FLEXIBLE/RUBBER BRAKE LINES AND FITTINGS AT CALIPERS/DRUMS WERE \"OK\" AND NOT REPLACED.

MY OPINION; POOR QUALITY METALS IN ORIGINAL FACTORY ROTORS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT BRAKE FAILURE ON THIS VEHICLE WHICH CAUSED BRAKING SAFETY ISSUES AND AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE; POOR BRAKING OCCURS AND THE HIGH COST OF REPAIR WILL MEAN SOME OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE WILL PUT OFF REPAIRS AND CONTINUE OPERATING THIS VEHICLE WITH DAMAGED BRAKE SYSTEMS.
