THEN THEN CONTACTED GM AND WERE TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS WITH IN SPECKS.    I WAS GIVEN THE NUMBER FOR GM AND I MADE A CALL TO THEM.  AFTER AN HOUR ON THE PHONE AND TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS WITHIN SPECKS AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME.

THEY HAVE MADE APPOINTMENTS FOR MY VEHICLE BUT THE AIR BAG IS  STILL NOT WORKING. I AM 5 9 AND 120 LBS AND MY HUSBAND AND I CAN NOT USE MY VEHICLE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A WORKING AIR BAG. IN THIS SMALL OF A CAR I WOULD DIE IN A HIGHWAY ACCIDENT WITH OUT AN AIR BAG. MY HUSBAND GETS UPSET THAT WE CAN NOT USE A NEW CAR WITH FUEL ECONOMY FOR TRIPS TOGETHER BECAUSE I'M NOT PROTECTED. THIS CAR IS NEW!! THE CHEVY AVEO IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED. YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL NOT BE SAFE, AND YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH A NEW AND UNUSABLE CAR. THE PASSENGER AIR BAG DOES NOT EVEN ACTIVATE WHILE DRIVING IN TOWN. THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. IT HAS TAKEN ME 3 MONTHS TO FIND A PLACE THAT WOULD TAKE MY COMPLAINTS. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY ONE TO DEAL WITH THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. WHAT GOOD IS A CAR WITH OUT A FONT AIR BAG. PLEASE SOMEONE TAKE THIS SAFETY HAZARD SERIOUS.
