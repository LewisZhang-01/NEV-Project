My back rear brake light also gets stuck and stays on after i put my car in park and turn off my car. In order for me to release it,  I have to press down firmly on the brake pedal and or restart the car, drive around put it back in park and then press down firmly on the brake pedal for it to turn off.  The back rear light staying on and the front passenger brakes overheating happen intermittently  multiple times throughout the day or week with no particular pattern.  When my front passenger brake overheats, it begins to smoke and shake/vibrate violently which causes me to have to pull the car over and wait about 15min for it to cool down before getting back on the road. No ABS lights, no Engine lights come on, only a message pops up on my dashboard that says \"Breaks Overheating\" and then it goes away on its own after 15minutes.  I see that your website has a preliminary announcement but there should be a recall on this issue. on 9/9 I went to Radley Cadillac on 3421 Jeff Davis Hwy Fredericksburg VA 22401 for a diagnostic & they stated that my Brake Pedal Arm, EBC and BPMV need to be replaced b/c it keeps engaging & locking my front passenger brake. I also went to another repair shop for a 2nd opinion on 9/10 & paid another diag fee they stated the same thing, 4637 Mine Rd, Fredericksburg, VA 22408 that the brake pedal arm will need to be replaced first as to they believe this is the underlying issue and the code C0161 was present. I was quoted over $2800 - $3500 to get this job done.  Neither establishments mentioned this service announcement  https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2018/MC-10141352-9999.pdf , i found this on my own by researching and googling this problem.  I am asking that you deem this is a safety issue as to this involves braking and the safety of my vehicle.  thank you.",

AFTER HE WAS DONE, THE LIGHTS STILL DIDN'T COME ON. WELL, THE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE WORKED BUT NOT THE MAIN CENTER LIGHTS. ANYWAY, I GOGGLED THIS TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE. OMG! SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUE.  A FEW PEOPLE WENT TO THE CADILLAC DEALER HAD THE LIGHTS FIXED AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS, THE LIGHTS WERE OUT AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE TRIED FIXING THE ISSUE THEMSELVES AND AFTER WORKING FOR A FEW WEEKS, LIGHTS WERE OUT AGAIN. YESTERDAY, I SAW TWO OF THE SAME CADILLACS SRX AND NOTICED THE SAME THING. THE FRONT LIGHTS WERE OUT AND VERY DIM SUCH AS OURS. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!! PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE IN DANGER. WE NOTICED IT WHEN MY HUSBAND HAD TO RUSH ME TO THE ER LATE LAST YEAR OR EARLIER THIS YEAR. IT WAS AROUND 11 PM AND THE STREET WE HAD TO DRIVE DOWN WAS COMPLETELY DARK. IT WAS A TWO WAY STREET AND WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE HEAD BEAMS WHEN NO CARS WAS COMING ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE WAS SO FRIGHTENED WHEN WE HAD TO TURN THEM OFF BECAUSE HOW DARK IT WAS. THERE WERE NO STREET LIGHTS UNTIL WE GOT CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL. WE HAD DATE NIGHT AND STAYED AT A HOTEL AND THE AREA WAS AROUND AN INDIAN RESERVATION WHICH IS VERY DARK.   JUST THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION OUR EXPERIENCE AND HOW THIS ISSUE IS PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN HARMS WAY.

I WAS DRIVING 70MPD ON 94-E, IT HAD THUNDER STORMED THE ENTIRE WEEKEND, AND WAS RAINING TERRIBLY WHEN THIS ALL TOOK PLACE. THE VEHICLE DECREASED IN SPEED DOWN TO 17-20 AND WOULDN'T GO ANY FASTER.  I EXIT THE FREEWAY, PULLED INTO GAS STATION TO READ MY MANUAL. STABILITY TRACK WAS MY MESSAGE. I CRANKED FINE, AND DROVE OK BUT NOT MORE THAN 20MPH. THE MORNING AFTER, APPARENTLY THE BREAK SYSTEM HAD DRIED, THE VEHICLE DROVE PERFECT AT THE SPEED IT SHOULD. I STILL TOOK IT TO SHOP BECAUSE MY CONCERN WAS THAT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  WHEN IT RAIN, THE VEHICLE WOULD LEAK INTO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE UNDER THE GLOVE BOX AND IT WAS A NICE PUDDLE.  I THOUGHT I LEFT THE WINDOW CRACKED. THE SHOP MECHANIC FOUND WATER SPOTS IN THE MOON ROOF AREA AND THE BREAK AREA AND UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR CARPET ON THE SIDE WHERE THE WATER HAD LEAKED. THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD PURCHASED THE WEATHER TECH MATTS, AND THAT MADE ME WONDER WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR; WHY WOULD A PERSON PURCHASE SUCH EXPENSIVE MATTS WHEN IT'S A LEASE AND WILL BE GETTING RETURNED.  THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT IF THE LEAK WASN'T FIXED THIS WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN, EVENTUALLY EFFECT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE INCORRECT READINGS OF EACH FUNCTIONAL ABILITY. MY VEHICLE WAS IN THE SHOP FOR 1 MONTH. THE MOON ROOF WAS THE ONLY LEAK AND THE PART TOOK A WEEK TO COME IN. THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK STATED BY THE MECHANIC BECAUSE IF THE MOON ROOF ISN'T INSTALLED PROPERLY IT COULD BLOW OFF WHEN IN HIGH SPEED OR WILL LEAK AIR. I'VE READ MANY DOING THIS PROCESS AND MANY I'VE READ JUST DEALT WITH THE TUBING TO STOP THE LEAK, NOT ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEM WITH THE SUNROOF SEALS.

THIS IS NOT A MOTOR OR TRANSMISSION OR A SET OF TIRES THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER AND THEREFORE THE DEALER. THE REAR LIFT GATE IS DANGEROUS WHEN OPERABLE DUE TO OPENING AND CLOSING IMPROPERLY ERRATICALLY AND UNEXPECTANTLY POSSIBLY GETTING AN ADULT CHILD OR ANIMALS LIMBS OR EXTREMITIES CAUGHT IN THE LIFT GATE. ALSO WHEN THE LIFT GATE BECOMES COPLETELY INOPERABLE ONE MIGHT HAVE A LIMB OR EXTREMITY CAUGHT AND NOT HAVE ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE LIFT GATE MANUALLY FOR WHEN IT STOPS WORKING THERE IS NO WAY TO RELEASE IT. CADILLAC IS OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF THIS UNIT AND ARE RISKING CONSUMERS SAFETY BUT JUST REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. 780000 GM LIFT GATES RECALLED WHY NOT CADILLAC",

AFTER  3 DAYS, AND $1700, THE DEALERSHIP SEEMED TO HAVE FIXED THE ISSUES, WITH NEW STRUTS, BUSHINGS AND STEERING COIL.  HOWEVER, WITHIN 3 MONTHS, ALL THE ORIGINAL DEFECTS REEMERGED.  IN FACT, THE VIBRATIONS WORSENED, WITH A FEELING THAT THE ENTIRE SUSPENSION WAS LOOSE FROM THE CHASSIS, AND VIBRATIONAL THUMPS AT HIGHWAY DRIVING SOUND LIKE AN 18 WHEELER WHEN IT DRIVES OVER TRAIN TRACKS, WITH BOOMS, AS IF THE AXLE DISENGAGES FROM THE ENTIRE MONO-FRAME.

ABOUT 4 WEEKS AND ROUGHLY 1000 MILES LATER, ON FRIDAY FEBRUARY 20, 2015, I USED THE VEHICLE TO GO TO THE DOCTORS AND NOTICED NO PROBLEMS ON THE WAY. MY 7YR OLD SON WAS WITH ME.

I STOPPED AT A 7-11 ON HOSPITAL ROAD AND NYS RT 27 IN EAST PATCHOGUE WHERE I ATTEMPTED TO INSPECT WHAT I COULD ON THE VEHICLE, MOSTLY THE CONDITION OF THE TIRES. I THEN LEFT 7-11 AND PROCEEDED TO ENTER THE ON RAMP FOR NYS RT27 EAST. AS I ACCELERATED IN THE ON RAMP, THE VEHICLE STARTED SWAYING MORE. AFTER THAT I HEARD A METALLIC SOUND AND THE REAR OF THE CAR STARTED TO JACKKNIFE. I WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND A POLICE OFFICER ENTERING THE HIGHWAY BEHIND ME STOPPED TO OFFER AID. AFTER A QUICK LOOK, HE STATED THAT THE CAR HAD A BROKEN AXLE. HE LEFT SINCE I HAD ALREADY CONTACTED MY HUSBAND AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY. MY HUSBAND ARRIVED SHORTY THEREAFTER AND INFORMED ME THAT HE CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK. WHILE WAITING FOR ROADSIDE SERVICE TO ARRIVE HE ALSO INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND ALSO TOOK PHOTOS. HE SAID THE RIGHT REAR TOE LINK, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN INSPECTED AND REPLACED AS NECESSARY AS PER THE RECALL NOTICE AT KING O'ROURKE 4 WEEKS EARLIER HAD SEPARATED. HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE LINKS WERE NOT REPLACED AND FAILED DUE TO DAMAGED THREADING. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE MECHANIC THAT TOWED THE CAR TO MY HOME.

THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED AND THE CAR STOPPED, THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A CADILLAC DEALER.( WEEKS BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RECALL ON THE AIR BAGS, SEAT, SUSPENSION AND SEAT BELT.) SO, WHEN I TOLD THE ADJUSTOR ABOUT THE RECALL HE JUST BRUSHED IT OFF AND SAID,\" IT'S NOT THE RECALL.\". I DON'T THINK THE ADJUSTOR WORKED FOR AN OUTSIDE COMPANY. I NEED TO GET MY CAR INDEPENDENTLY CHECKED SO I CAN FIND OUT IF IT WAS THE RECALL ITEMS. HOW COULD MY AIR BAGS DEPLOY FROM GOING OVER THE CURVE? THE CAR HAS NO DAMAGE... NONE! I THINK THE DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO FIX THE RECALLED ITEMS OR THEY FIXED THEM WRONG. BECAUSE MY DRIVER SEAT WAS MAKING SOME CRAZY SOUNDS THE WEEKS BEFORE THE AIRS BAGS CAME OUT. PLUS, I TOLD THE DEALER AND HE SAID ALL THE WORK WAS DONE TO THE CAR. I THINK THEIR LYING....  IS THERE A GOVERNMENT PLACE I CAN HAVE THE CAR CHECKED OR CAN YOU SEND SOMEONE?    CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

I HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN (GM MAJOR GUARD), BUT THE SEALED BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PLAN.  DEALER QUOTED COST OF $1,800 PER LIGHT, TOTAL OF $3,600 TO REPAIR.  THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW, BASED ON NUMEROUS CADILLAC COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS NOTES FOUND ON NHTSA.  IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, THE VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVABLE IN LOW VISIBILITY CONDITIONS OR AT NIGHT BECAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE FAILED DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW.  DEALER WILL NOT REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY, AND WITHOUT REPAIR THE VEHICLE WILL NOT EVEN PASS A STATE SAFETY INSPECTION.  THIS IS A RECALL WORTHY FAULT WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF LIFE IF FAULT OCCURS IN LOW VISIBILITY OR NIGHT DRIVING, AND RENDERS THE VEHICLE UNSAFE AS IT WILL NOT PASS STATE SAFETY INSPECTION.

I PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 2010 CADILLAC SRX IN DECEMBER 2010 FROM CREST CARS (CADILLAC AUTHORIZED DEALER) AND THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING GOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKE.    THE BRAKE MAKES LOTS OF UNACCEPTABLE GRINDING AND RATTLE NOISE IMMEDIATELY WHENEVER I START TO RELEASE THE BRAKE OR APPLY IT PARTIALLY. HERE'S HOW TO DUPLICATE THE NOISE:   - IF THE CAR STOPS, RELEASE THE BRAKE GRADUALLY. THE GRINDING NOISE APPEARS VERY LOUD, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CAR IS IN A SLOPE SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.      - IF THE CAR IS MOVING, APPLY THE BRAKE TO STOP IT. ABOUT LESS THAN ONE SECOND BEFORE THE CAR GOES TO A COMPLETE STOP, THE GRINDING NOISE RE-APPEARS.     I CONTACTED CREST CAR (THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR) AND HAVE THEM TAKE A LOOK TO FIX IT. AFTER ABOUT 2 DAYS, THEY RETURNED THE CAR TO ME, SAYING THAT THEY \"CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE NOISE\".     HERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION I RECEIVED FROM DEALER:  - THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREED WITH ME THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKE IS VALID.   - THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREED THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE NOISE WITH THE BRAKE  - THE TECHNICIAN STATED IN THE PAPERWORK THAT THE NOISE FROM THE BRAKE ALSO COMES FROM OTHER 2010 SRX CROSSOVER.    SERVICE ADVISOR REFUSED TO HONOR WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIX THE NOISE. THE CAR IS ONLY 3-4 MONTHS OLD AND UNDER FULL WARRANTY. WHENEVER I APPLY THE BRAKE, I TRY TO PRESS HARDER THAN I SHOULD HAVE. TO OVERCOME THE NOISE, WHENEVER I TRY TO RELEASE THE BREAK, I TRY TO RELEASE COMPLETELY INSTEAD OF GRADUALLY RELEASING IT. SINCE THE BRAKE AFFECTS MY HABIT OF CONTROLLING THE CAR, IT IS CONSIDERED A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE CAR.    [XXX] *TR",
