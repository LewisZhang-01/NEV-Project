AFTER PULLING OVER TO THE SHOULDER, THE TRUCK RESTARTED AND RAN BRIEFLY BEFORE SHUTTING DOWN AGAIN. IT HAD TO BE TOWED AT THAT POINT. THE TRUCK WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER THE SECOND ATTEMPT AT FIXING THE TRUCK, WHICH LED TO ANOTHER HIGH SPEED STALL WITH LOSS OF CONTROL, THEY FINALLY REPLACED THE CAM POSITION SENSOR (CPS). I HAD TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM WHEN I HAD IT TOWED THE FIRST TIME. IT SEEMS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG FORD 7.3L DIESEL OWNERS THAT THIS PART FAILS WITHOUT WARNING AT AS EARLY AS 500 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. MOST OWNERS CARRY A SPARE IN THEIR TRUCKS TO AVOID BEING STRANDED. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS HAS BECOME A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE WITH THESE TRUCKS AS MORE AND MORE FAMILIES USE THEM AS GROCERY-GETTERS AND/OR THE FAMILY WAGON. A LESS EXPERIENCED DRIVER OR A DRIVER IN A MORE HAZARDOUS SETTING WOULD NOT HAVE FARED AS WELL AS I DID. I URGE YOU TO RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM AND BRING IT TO LIGHT SO THAT FORD CAN NO LONGER SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG UNTIL PEOPLE GET HURT. AS THESE TRUCKS GET MORE MILES ON THEM THE ODDS INCREASE DRAMATICALLY THAT THE CPS WILL FAIL LEAVING THE VEHICLE IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE STATE IN MANY INSTANCES. *JB",

        "summary": "THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH BRAKING ON THE DIESEL TRUCKS.  WHEN APPLING THE BRAKES IN A PANIC SITUATION AND ONE OR BOTH OF THE REAR WHEELS LOOSE TRACTION, THE RABS KICKS IN AND THE PEDAL GOES TO THE FLOOR.  THIS IS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY SUDDEN INCREASE IN STEERING EFFORT AT THE SAME TIME IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO STEER AROUND AN ACCIDENT SITUATION.  THESE DIESEL TRUCKS USE A HYDRO BOOST SYSTEM RUN OFF OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP FOR THE BRAKES.  THERE IS ALSO A SUDDEN DECREASE, MANY TIMES SEVERE, IN BRAKING POWER.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE ONLY WAY TO REGAIN THE BRAKES IS TO RELEASE THEM AND REAPPLY THEM, TAKING GREAT CARE NOT TO SKID ONE OR BOTH OF THE REAR TIRES.  TALKING TO OTHER OWNERS, IT APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW AND REPLACING PARTS WILL NOT REPAIR THE SITUATION.  THE MASTER CYLINDER AND CALIPERS ARE ALL WORKING PROPERLY AND THIS TRUCK HAS DONE IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS NEW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE I HAVE HAD TO APPLY THE BRAKES IN A PANIC STOP AND HAD ONE OR BOTH OF THE REAR WHEELS START TO SKID.  THE BRAKE PEDAL THEN GOES TO THE FLOOR, BRAKING IS SEVERELY DIMINISHED AND THE ABILITY TO STOP IS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.  ONLY BY RELEASING AND RE-APPLYING THE BRAKES CAN BRAKING BE RESTORED AND IT IS ONLY THROUGH THIS EFFORT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS OF DRIVING POLICE VEHICLES THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID SEVERAL ACCIDENTS.
