I REALIZE THAT OVER TIME PARTS ON A VEHICLE WILL BREAK AND AT 118,000 MILES I SHOULD EXPECT TO INCUR MAINTENANCE EXPENSES. HOWEVER, BASED ON MY RESEARCH GM USED A SUBSTANDARD BOLT AND THIS ISSUE IMPACTS MILLIONS OF GM V8 MOTORS. FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, I HAD THE REPAIR DONE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK HAVING EXHAUST FUMES ENTERING THE CAB OF MY VEHICLE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS TYPE OF EXHAUST LEAK COULD HAVE EPA IMPLICATIONS AS WELL.         IN ORDER TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE, THE DEALERSHIP HAD TO PULL THE HEAD BECAUSE ONE OF THE TWO BOLTS THAT SHEARED OFF WAS FLUSH WITH THE HEAD AND HAD TO BE DRILLED OUT. TOTAL COST WAS $1,381.07. THE SAD FACT IS THAT AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE BACK, IT IS RUNNING ROUGH AND CHANCE ARE I WILL HAVE TO RETURN IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ADDITIONAL REPAIRS. I CONTEND THAT WHEN MAJOR REPAIRS LIKE THIS ARE DONE, THE VEHICLE IS SELDOM THE SAME. IT TOOK 5 DAYS TO GET IT BACK DO TO THE WEEKEND.     IF THE NHTSA WON'T TAKE ANY ACTIONS OVER CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXHAUST LEAK, I HOPE SOME LAW FIRM MIGHT CONSIDER STARTING A CLASS ACTION SUIT.

THE AT LEAST LET THE OWNERS BUY THE PARTS  AND GM INSTALL  THEM. AND  FOR GM TO STATE THAT  THIS A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME  ANYBODY  THOUGHT  TO CHECK FOR  RUSTED  OUT BRAKE  LINES WHEN. THEY WERE  CHANGING THE  OIL  OR DOING  A TUNE  UP .OR CHANGING BRAKE  PADS  OR TIRES. THOSE ARE NORMAL  WEAR  AND TEAR  OWNER  MAINTENANCE  ISSUES. MY 2004 FORD  F350 HAS 220 THOUSAND  MILES. RUNS  GREAT  TO BUT THE BRAKE LINES  AREN'T ROTTING  OUT OF THE  VEHICLE. WHAT  GM IS CLAIMING IS A EXTREMELY  WEAK  ARGUMENT. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.",

HE SAID THAT UPON INSPECTION OF THE REST OF MY BRAKE LINES, THEY WERE ALL VERY RUSTED AND IN DANGER OF ALSO BUSTING OPEN.

I CALLED GM & ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 9 TSB #'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE, THERE IS STILL NO RECALL OR HELP ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. I THINK IT IS TIME TO SELL THE TAHOE THAT I BOUGHT BRAND NEW BTW AND MOVE ON TO A NEW FORD TRUCK AS THEY SEEM TO HAVE REALLY GOOD TRUCKS NOW. IT IS SAD BECAUSE I HAVE LOVED MY TAHOE Z71 AND NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET RID OF IT. THE STEERING HAS NEVER BEEN RIGHT ON THIS TAHOE SINCE DAY 1 AND GM KNOWS IT BUT BURIES THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND ABOUT IT RATHER THAN DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIX THE ISSUE. MINE STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW BUT THE POPPING NOISES WHEN TURNING HAS ALWAYS IRRITATED ME & NOW THAT IT GAVE OUT, I AM DONE WITH IT. I AM THANKFUL THAT MINE OCCURRED WHEN IT DID AND NOT WHEN I WAS TRAVELING DOWN THE ROAD WITH 6 YARDS OF MULCH IN A DUMP TRAILER AND MAKING A TURN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED ME AND SOMEONE ELSE COMING THE OTHER WAY.

MY CHEVROLET TAHOE HAS BOTH THESE ISSUES.  THEY STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE LETTER.  WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE FROM GENERAL MOTORS IS WHY MY SAFETY IS NOT AN CONCERN TO THEM BECAUSE I HAVE DRIVEN MORE THAN 70,000 MILES IN MY TAHOE?  I TRAVEL THROUGH A LOT OF RURAL AREAS TO WORK AND I FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT RUN OUT OF GAS.  I FEEL IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  THE SPEEDOMETER REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING 60 OR 70 MILES PER HOUR WHEN I AM SITTING AT A RED LIGHT.  WHEN I AM GOING DOWN THE ROAD IT REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING OVER 120 MILES PER HOUR.  THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL FOR SPEEDING TICKETS.  I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT GENERAL MOTORS CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY MILES THEY HAVE DRIVEN.   THESE GAUGES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE REPLACED AND THEY ARE A SAFETY HAZARD.  NOT BEING ABLE TO MONITOR YOUR RATE OF SPEED OR BE AWARE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH GAS TO GET HOME ARE SAFETY ISSUES TO ME FOR MY HEALTH AS WELL AS MY PEACE OF MIND AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY GENERAL MOTORS DOESN'T FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECTING THIS DEFAULT THEY ARE AWARE FOR ALL THEIR TAHOE OWNERS.
