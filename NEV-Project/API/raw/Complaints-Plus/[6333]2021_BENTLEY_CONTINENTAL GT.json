They move totally backward, trapping the person sitting in the back.  My friend had to remove her shoes and actually pull her legs out using her hands and arms.  Had there been an accident or a fire, this person would be killed before she could escape.  I know it has been recalled and I took it to the dealer for the service.  Dimmit automotive Service Department had the car for 24 hours and the seat is not fixed.  This is a dangerous recall.  How can I get Dimmit Automotive in Pinellas Park, Florida, to actually do this repair?  Please, I have grandchildren who love to ride in the back.  Help before someone is in danger.",
