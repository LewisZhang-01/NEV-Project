I WAS TRAVELING BETWEEN 55-60 MPH AND ACCELERATING TO ACHIEVE PACE WITH THE OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY.  MY CAR WAS STRUCK IN THE REAR, AND PROPELLED FORWARD STRIKING A MINIVAN IN FRONT TO ME.  I WAS PUSHED OFF THE ROAD AND INTO THE SEA GRAPE STAND, AND THEN STRUCK ONE OF THE POSTS ON A HIGHWAY INFORMATION SIGN.  MY CAR WAS TOTALED. (SEE THE PHOTO)    NEITHER AIRBAG IN THE CAR DEPLOYED.    I HAD RECEIVED NOTICES FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY THAT MY CAR HAD TAKADA AIRBAGS IN IT, AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE REPLACED.  I WAS NOTIFIED APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR AGO THAT REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIR BAG WERE AVAILABLE.  SO, I WENT TO THE AUTO NATION FORD DEALER AND GARAGE LOCATED ON LINTON BLVD, AND INTERSTATE 95 IN DELRAY BEACH, FLORIDA TO HAVE THE BAG REPLACED.  I DROPPED THE CAR OFF IN THE MORNING AND PICKED IT UP LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE BAG HAD BEEN REPLACED.  I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR EVER SINCE WITH THE BELIEF THAT I HAD A NON-TAKADA FUNCTIONING DRIVER'S SIDE AIR BAG.    NEITHER THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIR BAG NOR THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG DEPLOYED DURING THE ACCIDENT.  HOWEVER, EACH OF THE OTHER THREE VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT HAD FULL DEPLOYMENT OF THEIR AIR BAGS.IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE AIR BAG REPLACEMENT IN MY CAR BY THE AUTO NATION FORD DEALERSHIP WAS DEFICIENT AND DID NOT MEET CRASH STANDARDS FOR DEPLOYMENT.

THE CAR SUSTAINED APPROXIMATELY $6900 WORTH OF DAMAGE. WE HAD THE CAR REPAIRED AT MCREE FORD'S COLLISION CENTER. BEFORE THE DEALERSHIP GAVE US THE CAR BACK, THEY TOLD US THAT THEY COULD NOT GET THE ERROR LIGHT FOR THE AIRBAGS TO GO OFF AND THAT IT WOULD BE A SHORT DELAY IN GIVING US THE CAR BACK. IT TOOK THEM APPROXIMATELY 3 DAYS TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG AND THEY ASSURED US THAT IT WAS FIXED. NOW, ON MAY 2011, SHE WAS AGAIN INVOLVED IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT IN WHICH SHE WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 -50 MPH WHEN MY WIFE \"T-BONED\" A TRUCK WHO RAN THE STOP SIGN AND GOT INTO HER LANE. SHE HAD NO CHANCE TO STOP THE VEHICLE SO SHE ENDED UP HITTING THE TRUCK. BECAUSE THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK, THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK WAS TICKETED.  THE FRONT OF THE MUSTANG SUSTAINED APPROXIMATELY $9900 WORTH OF DAMAGE. MY WIFE SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES (MINOR WHIPLASH AND A BRUISE ON HER LEG). THE REASON FOR MY LETTER IS THAT MY WIFE'S INJURIES COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER DURING BOTH ACCIDENTS DID NOT DEPLOY. NOW, WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS DEFECTIVE FROM MANUFACTURING OR IF MCREE FORD DID NOT REPAIR THE AIRBAGS CORRECTLY FROM THE ACCIDENT THAT OCCURRED IN OCTOBER 2010.  IT IS OUR BELIEVE THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS DEFECTIVE FROM MANUFACTURING GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT DEPLOY IN EITHER ACCIDENT AND ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL AND ALL THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE FROM MCREE FORD, THE VEHICLE WAS EQUIPPED WITH BOTH FRONTAL AND SIDE AIRBAGS.

I TOOK IT IN TO THE FORD DEALER THE NEXT DAY AND THEY REPAIRED THE TIRE VALVE STEM FREE OF CHARGE BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS DEFECTIVE. TODAY (09/30/08) I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND MY BACK PASSENGER TIRE WENT FLAT. I TOOK IT IN TO THE FORD DEALER AFTER I CHECKED THE VALVE STEM AND SAW THAT IT WAS CRACKED ALL AROUND THE BASE. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE PREVIOUS EVENT AND TOLD THEM I WAS SURE IT WAS THE VALVE STEM. THEY CALLED ME BACK AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD KNOW BECAUSE I HAD RUN THE TIRE WHILE IT WAS FLAT AND IT WOULD NOT BE WARRANTED. THEY WOULD NOT EVEN CHECK THE VALVE FOR ME. THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 3 DAYS TO GET THE TIRE IN STOCK AND I TOLD THEM I HAVE TO COMMUTE TO WORK AND I COULD NOT DRIVE ON A DOUGHNUT FOR 3 DAYS. THEY SENT ME TO A TIRE DEALER IN TOWN THAT WOULD HAVE THAT SIZE (BUT NOT THE SAME BRAND) TIRE IN STOCK. I WENT THERE AND THEY FIXED IT BUT IT COST ME $172 AND THEY SHOWED ME MY OTHER 2 DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE VALVE STEMS WERE CRACKED AND THE BACK DRIVER'S SIDE VALVE STEM WAS ABOUT TO COME OFF. NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FORD DEALER AND HOPE THEY REPLACE THEM WITHOUT A FIGHT.   2. THIS HAS OCCURRED 2 TIMES NOW WITH ANOTHER 2 GUARANTEED IF I DO NOT TAKE ACTION NOW.   3. THE FIRST TIRE FORD REPLACED ONLY THE VALVE STEM (AND THEY PUT ONE THAT WAS WAY TOO LONG ON MY TIRE SO NOW IT IS FIXED BUT IT STICKS OUT WHICH I AM SURE IS ANOTHER HAZARD). THE SECOND ONE, THE VALVE STEM COULD NOT BE REPAIRED BECAUSE THE TIRE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE ON. I HAD TO GO TO A TIRE DEALER AND HAVE THEM PUT ON A BRAND-NEW DIFFERENT BRAND OF TIRE. *TR",
