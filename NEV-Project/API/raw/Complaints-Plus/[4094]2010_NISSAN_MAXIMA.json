        "summary": "ON SUNDAY, 5 FEBRUARY 2017, I LEFT MY HOUSE TO VISIT MY BROTHER AT 10AM AND WHEN I CAME BACK OUTSIDE (20MINS LATER) TO MY CAR, IT WOULD NOT START. AN ORANGE LIGHT THAT READ \"KEY\" POPPED UP ON THE DASHBOARD. TRIED TO START THE CAR AND THE KEY LIGHT CAME ON, BRAKES WERE HARD TO PRESS, AND THE IGNITION WOULD NOT START ONLY LOCK WOULD SHOW UP ON THE PUSH TO START BUTTON. AFTER TWO HOURS, I HAD TO GET THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHILE WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE, I DID SOME SEARCHING ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM WITH THE NISSAN MAXIMA AND NOT COVERED BY ANY EXTENDED WARRANTIES; THOUGH I READ THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED OFTEN ENOUGH WITH THE 2009 MAXIMA THAT NISSAN ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO COVER THIS REPAIR. THE PIECE IN QUESTION THAT WAS THE PROBLEM... QUOTED BY NISSAN IS THE \"STEERING LOCK.\" THIS PIECE HAS BEEN RECALLED BY NISSAN IN THE EARLIER MODELS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT FOR MY VEHICLE (WHICH IS THE YEAR AFTER THE ONE THAT IS RECALLED) APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T FIX THIS ISSUE. MONDAY, 6 FEBRUARY 2017, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO CONFIRM MY CAR ISSUE (LOCK STEERING) AND THE COST WAS GOING TO BE $1104 TO REPAIR, WITH MY MILITARY DISCOUNT THE COST WAS $985.46. STILL THIS IS MONEY I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER MALFUNCTION AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WEAR AND TEAR OF VEHICLE. WHICH, BTW, THE VEHICLE IS IN GREAT SHAPE AND HAS HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE CHECKS AND ALL WORK COMPLETED BY A NISSAN TECHNICIAN WHICH MAKES THIS EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING. THIS COMPLAINT IS TO NOT ONLY BRING ATTENTION TO THE ONGOING ISSUE WITH THE 2010 NISSAN MAXIMA, BUT TO ALSO GET REIMBURSED FOR MY OUT OF POCKET REPAIR. I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL NISSAN CUSTOMER SINCE 2000 (THIS IS MY THIRD MAXIMA; FAVORITE TYPE OF CAR), BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY NISSAN, YOU'RE LOSING YET ANOTHER CUSTOMER'THIS IS RIDICULOUS.",

I'VE RECENTLY CALLED THEM AGAIN THIS PAST FRIDAY AND THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID SOMEONE WILL CONTACT ME IN A FEW HOURS. TODAY IS WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 14, 2016 AND STILL NO PHONE CALL. I WAS ADVISED A FEW WEEKS AGO TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND GET A QUOTE BY NISSAN HQ AND CALL THEM BACK WITH THE INFORMATION.  I'VE DONE THAT AND NOW THEY WON'T RETURN MY CALLS. [XXX] CONTACT NUMBER IS [XXX] AND MD CASE # [XXX]. NISSAN KEEPS CLOSING MY CASE NUMBER AND WON'T ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I JUST DON'T WANT MY FAMILY PUT AT RISK IF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DOESN'T DEPLOY BECAUSE OF A FAULTY SENSOR IN THE SEAT. I WANT NISSAN TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENS. THE CONTACT PERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR NISSAN IS [XXX] AND THAT NUMBER IS [XXX]. HE CAN VERIFY HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST BY THE QUOTE HE GAVE US. IT'S APPROXIMATELY $1,100 TO FIX.   THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER NHTSA.

I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE HYUNDAI-AUTHORIZED DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND THEY SAY NOTHING IS WRONG.

THE FACT THAT I HAD MY KEY AND WAS UNABLE TO START MY VEHICLE WHILE FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF MY OWNER'S MANUAL WAS DISCONCERTING AND CONCERNING.

A.    TO ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

NISSAN HAS DETERMINED THAT ON A SMALL NUMBER OF VEHICLES, DUE TO A MANUFACTURING IRREGULARITY THAT HAS SINCE BEEN CORRECTED, THE ESCL MAY MALFUNCTION AFTER THE STEERING COLUMN IS LOCKED AND COULD PREVENT THE ENGINE FROM STARTING.WHAT WILL BE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION? A.    NISSAN WILL EXTEND ITS NEW VEHICLE LIMITED WARRANTY COVERAGE FOR THE AFFECTED PART NUMBERS FROM ITS ORIGINAL DURATION OF 36 MONTHS/ 36,000 MILES TO 72 MONTHS/UNLIMITED MILES ) I INVESTIGATED ON LINE AND THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS BY OWNERS WITH 2010 MODELS THAT HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM NISSAN ADMITS TO A MANUFACTURE PROBLEM HOW CAN THEY NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING IT FREE OF CHARGE FOR ALL 2010 WITH THE SAME  PROBLEM.  *TR",

AFTER BEING AT THE DEALER FOR AN HOUR I WAS INFORMED THAT THE KEY WAS FINE, AND THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE STEERING LOCK ASSEMBLY.  THE CONSULTANT TOLD ME THE REPAIR WOULD COST $925.82.  I WAS SHOCKED THAT A $5 ISSUE HAD JUMPED TO ALMOST $1000. I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN RESEARCHING THE ISSUE, AND WAS ABLE TO FIND A STATEMENT BY NISSAN NORTH AMERICA (WBI/13-009) THAT ADMITTED THE PART IN QUESTION HAD BEEN DEFECTIVE.  NISSAN EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR THE 2009 MODELS TO 6 YEARS/ UNLIMITED MILES, BUT WHY WOULD THEY NOT DO THE SAME FOR ALL MODELS WITH THE SAME ISSUE?  THE CONSULTANT ADVISED ME TO CALL 1-800-NISSAN1 TO REQUEST COMPENSATION FOR THE REPAIRS.  I WAS TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF THE 3 YEAR/ 36,000 MILE WARRANTY AND DID NOT QUALIFY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE SAME PART THAT MALFUNCTIONED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IF THEY DECIDED TO DO ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE I WOULD BE CONTACTED LATER.  I FIND THIS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE.  I DO NOT THINK CONSUMERS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO FAIL REPEATEDLY.  I HAVE COME ACROSS NUMEROUS FORUMS, WEBSITES, AND VIDEOS THAT DISCUSS THIS SAME ISSUE.  I FEEL THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACTIONS TO HELP LOYAL CUSTOMERS RESOLVE THIS RECURRING MALFUNCTION THAT HAS LEFT MANY STRANDED ONSIDE OF THE ROAD.

THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WHEN THEY RAN THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST. THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND TO BRING IT BACK IF THE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN. WELL ON FRIDAY, I TOOK IT BACK BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. NISSAN TECHNICIANS CHECK THE CAR AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE. WELL, ON SUNDAY, MARCH 16, 2014, I WAS ON MY CAR HOME.

CALLED THREE NISSAN DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA TO GET ADVICE ON WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE, THEY ALL SUGGESTED THAT I MAY NEED A NEW BATTERY IN THE FOB.

OCCASIONALLY WE HAVE NOTICED THAT THE PASSENGER AIR BAG LIGHT REMAINED ON FOR DIFFERING LENGTHS OF TIME AND DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. AT SOME POINT WE READ THE OWNERS MANUAL ABOUT THIS WARNING SIGNAL. IT SAID THE LIGHT SHOULD COME ON WHEN YOU START THE CAR AND GO OFF ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER. THIS WASN??T ALWAYS THE CASE.   THIS WARNING LIGHT TELLS ME THAT THE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT AND A PASSENGER IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WILL HAVE NO PROTECTION. I VIEW THIS AS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.     AIR BAG LIGHT ON READS, \"AIR BAG\"??  AT THIS POINT, AUGUST 2013, THE CAR HAS ONLY 19,000 MILES ON IT. THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE PROBLEM HAS RECURRED, BUT MORE FREQUENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2013 WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE WE PURCHASED IT. THEY TESTED IT WITH THEIR COMPUTER AND DETECTED NO PROBLEM. THEY SAID THE COMPUTER DIDN'T RECORD ANY INSTANCES OF THAT EVENT OCCURRING.  RECENTLY WE STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH ON LINE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND DISCOVERED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM. SOME RESPONSES THAT WERE GIVEN BY NISSAN INCLUDED PASSENGER NOT HEAVY ENOUGH. ONE WOMAN WEIGHED ABOUT 110 POUNDS AND ANOTHER WOMAN WEIGHED ABOUT 145 POUNDS. THEIR RESPONSE WASN'T LOGICAL. ANOTHER RESPONSE WAS THAT THE LEATHER WASN'T SOFT ENOUGH. THE SEATS IN OUR CAR ARE FABRIC, AND VERY SOFT. NISSANS RESPONSE WAS STUPID!!   APPARENTLY NISSAN HAS NO IDEA ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE VERY UNEASY ABOUT USING THIS CAR WITH THIS VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  AN EASY FIX THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS TO DISCONNECT THE WARNING LIGHT AND ARM THE AIRBAG FULL TIME, EVEN IF NO ONE IS IN THE SEAT.  LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.

ON A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF ROAD HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL STRAIGHT THE CAR WILL DART TO THE LEFT AND THEN TO THE RIGHT WITHOUT MOVING THE STEERING WHEEL.  ON THE TEST DRIVE I RODE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND COULD FEEL THE CAR MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT, THE SERVICE MGR SAID HE COULD FEEL IT ALSO BUT SAID THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE CROWN IN THE ROAD.  THIS PROBLEM BECOMES A SAFETY PROBLEM WHEN ON NARROW FOUR LANE ROADS, YOU MUST CONSTANTLY FIGHT THE STEERING WHEEL TO KEEP THE CAR ON THE ROAD OR KEEP FROM RUNNING INTO THE CAR ON YOUR LEFT.  I HAVE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO THIS BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRONIC STEERING IS DIFFERENT FROM MY PREVIOUS CARS.  I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO ADJUSTMENT THAT COULD BE MADE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.  I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND HAVE DRIVEN A FEW CARS IN MY TIME AND CAN TELL YOU THIS CAR SHOULD NOT DRIVE THE WAY IT DOES, IT IS JUST AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  IT FEELS AS IF THE CAR IS TRYING TO DRIVE ITSELF WITHOUT TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL,  THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER VEHICLES WITH THE ELECTRONIC STEERING - IE: TOYOTA AND CHEVROLET AND JUST WONDERING IF THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME ELECTRONIC STEERING COMPONENTS..
