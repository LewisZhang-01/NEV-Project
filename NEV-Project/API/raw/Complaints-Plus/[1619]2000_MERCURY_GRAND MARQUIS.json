EVEN IF I REPLACE THIS PART, I BELIEVE THIS EFFECTIVELY MAKES MY (AND ANY SUCH) CAR A RISK TO DRIVE, AS MOST REBUILT AUTO PARTS ARE CREATED BY SIMPLY REPLACING ANY FAILED COMPONENTS OUT OF THE MANY COMPONENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE PART, AND LEAVING OTHERS STILL OLD AND WORN. WHEN WOULD THE OTHER PARTS FAIL, AND IF THE CAR IS OPERATING IS A HIGH RISK UNKNOWN. ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THIS CREATES A SPECTACULAR HAZARD TO MOTORISTS, I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO CONSUMERS.
