All this is happening when there is nothing blocking car. If cruise control on & need to respond to car that just pulled in front of me on highway, because the brake pedal is already suppressed by the car I can not respond properly. The only thing I have found to override the car is to push the gas pedal, which is also very dangerous!! Please help!! This is so dangerous. If something is actually happening on the road it is difficult to think about how to respond because the car is freaking out. The ability to think clearly & respond to unsafe situations is so important in those first few seconds. Honda mechanic said this is \u2018just a side effect\u2019 of a self driving car feature (cruise control) until Honda improves technology.

It had been doing that off and on for a while and the dealers assured me my battery was fine on multiple service visits.

It would not start and they had to tow the car.  I've had my vehicle for 2.5 years and 38,500 miles.  I am very disappointed that a vehicle this new would leave me stranded in the middle of the road.    I have been taking it to 2 different dealers for service.  First Jay Wolfe Honda where I purchased the vehicle and more recently Olathe Honda.  I have had both of them check the battery in 2021.  Both indicated that the battery was fine.  I went back to Olathe Honda today as I had discussed the factory battery with them.  I have a service report from September of 2021 that indicates they checked the battery and to see the attached test results.  I asked them to see the test results and they indicated that they don't typically attach them because they are printed on thermo paper.  The service report indicated the battery was fine.

I washed the windshield and wiped off the sensor panel but it didn't stop.  The Honda dealer in Moline, IL told me that there was nothing they could do.  They said that happens in snow and rain and that I should wash the vehicle.  The vehicle is malfunctioning and dangerous.  It randomly applies the brakes and tries to steer itself at highway speed if there is any obstruction to the sensors.  I had to fight the steering wheel to keep it on the road when driving down the middle of the lane.  Having the car applying the brakes randomly at highway speed is also incredibly dangerous. I can't control how close semi trucks follow and several almost rear ended me.  They also got very upset because they thought I was doing it on purpose.  I can't wash the vehicle every time it snows or pull over every time it rains hard.  The dealers suggestions are not practical.

This vehicle has 32,096 and is still under the factory bumper to bumper warranty.  We have been experiencing an issue with the systems Auto-Start Stop feature.  The vehicle's engine stops at a red light, and when we release the brake, on numerous occasions the vehicle fails to restart the engine and stalls in the middle of the road.  This has happened more than 15 times since we have owned the vehicle and puts us in an unsafe situation.  We took our vehicle in for service at Checkered Flag on 08/12/2021 and explained the problem we were having to the service technicians.  During that visit, they were not able to duplicate our engine stalling issue (see service record attached).  Since 08/2021, this issue has continued to occur 6-8 times since August.  The engine attempts to restart itself after letting off the brake or after a set period of time, however after attempting to crank the engine, the car beeps and has to be restarted manually.  When attempting to restart the car manually, the car will not start the next 2-3 attempts, and will eventually restart after multiple presses of the engine start button.  This is extremely unsafe as we are not able to move the vehicle, sometimes for a few minutes.  According to the service records, the technicians performed a battery check, and the battery was fine.

My warranty is up to 80,000 miles.  The date listed below is when my husband mentioned it.  When accelerating, at low RPMs, usually between 1 and 2 rpm, the car hesitates accelerating.  it lasts about 1 to 5 seconds.

Sometimes the hesitation is kinda jerking you a few times, but other times, its a longer hesitation and your car kinda makes a sound like it all of a sudden just decided it was going to kick into gear and start going again.  This is a safety issue because if I'm pulling into traffic, changing lanes, crossing a road and my car hesitates or I can speed up fast enough when I should be able to, it could cause an accident.

The contact took the vehicle to a local dealer where they informed the contact of a recall on the vehicle NHTSA campaign number: 20V439000 (back over prevention, electrical system) and performed the recall repair for the failure but that did not fix the failure. The contact took the vehicle to multiple dealers to have it inspected but could not diagnose the cause of the failure. The connectors and wiring are so sub-par that even the small amount of pressure on them caused by routine on-road driving is enough to cause them to disconnect the entire Infotainment system. In short, the vehicle cannot currently be repaired by any Honda dealer. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximate 12,500 when the problem initially began. The vehicle currently has 27,000 miles. The infotainment system failure violates 2 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, FMVSS numbers 101 \"Control and Displays\" and 111 \"Rearview Mirrors\". Based on the information the contact has seen and learned from various Honda dealers, The Honda Motor Company is aware of this design flaw, as it has affected thousands of their vehicles. The Honda Pilot and the Honda Odyssey are the primary vehicles affected, but multiple other vehicles have also been affected. This can be easily supported by a simple search of the Internet. This failure is extremely dangerous. It has the very real potential to cause injury and death and needs to be corrected as soon as possible.",

I'd also complained since purchase about frequent false collision mitigation system errors some of which engaged the brakes.  On Monday May 3, 2021 I was on a highway off-ramp going about 30 MPH when my steering wheel suddenly locked up, the collision mitigation system sounded, the brakes engaged, and the car began to swerve into the oncoming lane over the double yellow lines. I was momentarily unable to drive back into my own lane because the steering wheel was locked. A few seconds later, the car went back to normal and I was able to put my blinker on and pull over into the breakdown lane. I was very frightened so I took a few minutes to calm down. Luckily, there were no oncoming vehicles and no one behind me when it happened.   On May 5, 2021 I was driving my vehicle on I-95 at approximately the speed limit of 65 MPH when the steering wheel again locked up, the brakes briefly auto-engaged, and the a/c unit shut off. I was in heavy traffic and was immediately concerned I would be rear-ended and/or drift into another lane causing an accident. Luckily, the steering wheel unlocked within a few seconds and the brakes stopped engaging. I was able to regain control before there was an accident.   Shortly thereafter, I had the car serviced at the dealership. The mechanics said the sensor was slightly off but that didn't explain the steering wheel locking up and other symptoms. At my insistence, they dug further and consulted Honda mechanics. That research pointed them to the battery. They fixed a loose battery terminal and said that could explain the issues I was having. I learned by my own research that 2019 Honda Odysseys had a recall for a similar issue. The dealership indicated they were doing me a favor to \"help you out\" and this was a one-time thing. I would have to pay for any future work or escalate to Honda.",

BUT EVEN THE AAA MECHANIC WHO CAME TO THE SCENE,WITH ALL HIS TOOLS, COULD NOT GET IT TO TURN. I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER WAY AND ULTIMATELY THEY SAID \"NO.\" THEY LATER TOLD ME, AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, THAT HONDA HAS A SPECIAL TOOL, REQUIRING THREE EXTENSIONS, USED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS DURING TRANSPORT TO THE DEALER. THIS SEEM QUITE UNSAFE. OBVIOUSLY, CARS CAN BE DISABLED IN MANY WAYS. WITHOUT A REASONABLY ACCESSIBLE MEANS OF PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, IT CANNOT BE MOVED IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION (FOR EXAMPLE, OUT OF A LANE OF TRAFFIC). IT DEFINITELY CAN'T BE DONE BY AN OWNER (UNLESS, I SUPPOSE IT'S SOMEONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO GOOGLE DURING THE EMERGENCY, FINDS THE VIDEO, AND HAS THE SPECIAL TOOL).

I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT MOST CARS HAVE A SHIFT LOCK OVERRIDE LEVER EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT, OFTEN ON OR NEAR THE SHIFT CONSOLE. IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THE DEALERSHIP,THEY SAY THAT 2020 PILOTS AND 2019 AND 2020 PASSPORTS ALSO HAVE THIS DESIGN. I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY OTHER VEHICLES ARE AFFECTED.

I WAS RECENTLY EXITING AN OFF RAMP FROM AN INTERSTATE AND WHEN I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC THE VEHICLE HESITATED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING. I THEN CONTINUED A FEW MILES WHICH I HAD REMAINING TO MY HOUSE AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ACCELERATE VERY POORLY AND THE ENGINE WOULD SHAKE UNDER ACCELERATION. THE MANUAL STATES THAT A FLASHING LIGHT IS AN ENGINE MISFIRE. I STARTED THE VEHICLE ON MONDAY MORNING TO TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER AND IT DROVE NORMALLY DOWN TO THE DEALER. AFTER CHECKING THE ENGINE COMPUTER THEY COULD FIND NO FAULT CODES FOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHING THE DAY BEFORE. THEY GAVE ME BACK THE VEHICLE AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AT THIS TIME. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT APPEARS THAT A FEW OTHER COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED FOR THIS SAME ISSUE. HAVING A VEHICLE THAT LOSES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF POWER CAN BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT HONDA LOOK INTO THIS MATTER CAREFULLY. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO A BRAND NEW VEHICLE WITH 2,200 MILES OR ANY VEHICLE FOR THAT MATTER.",
