When this happens the call counter on the screen is still going like I am on the call when I  am not. I have to disconnect my phone in order to use it. Then I have to pull over and go in the trunk and pull the radio fuss out so that it will clear everything out and then I can reconnect my phone and use the hands free again. When it freezes up , I can change anything, none of the buttons on the screen will works and the screen gets really hot to touch. Secondly when I go to crank my car sometimes whether it is a cold crank or not it may a hitting nose and it sound like it is coming from the back left side. That can happen several times a day or sometimes it doesn't happen at all. This is a new car for me so I don't know why I am having these problems and I work hard to finally be able to afford what I like for it to give me problems from the start. I have reached out to the dealership where I got it from but haven't hear anything back and the has been happening for a while. Please help.

I'm calling from Chrysler case management regarding the case that was escalated up for the 2019 Chrysler 300. I understand that you're working with Chapman Dodge in Scottsdale regarding an ongoing concern with the radio. I have reached out to them and requested the information. We need to determine what involvement we need to get started and what the next steps are. Essentially. I'm available Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. To 6:30 p.m. Eastern, and my number here is 844-378-0597. My extension is 406-0076. Thank you.  Hello, this is Michael from Ram Uconnect customer care. Just give me a quick call in regards to your new Dodge Challenger. Actually, this was a Chrysler 300 was not seeing the VIN number. But basically need the the part is on order confirm with the dealership that they made a mistake and they they put 2 orders under your name. One of them was for a different customer, but they were able to track it Down based off the serial ID number. That one was already installed. This one is currently showing an ETA of eight to twenty two. Twenty Twenty-One. But yeah, we got involved. We got it expedited. We're going to try to see about getting it sooner. It's currently being shipped from the supplier. So it hasn't actually started ship off. Basically what they're doing right now is they're trying to get it released. And that's where we're at. So, yeah, it's currently shipping from the supplier by that when I mean is there trying to release it so often. Do you have any questions? Feel free to give me a call? My telephone number's going to be 100-860-6632 extension 30478. Hope you have a great evening. Bye.  CHAOS@CHRYSLER",
