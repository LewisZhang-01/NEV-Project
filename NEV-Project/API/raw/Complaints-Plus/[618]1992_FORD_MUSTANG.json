IF THIS WAS A TRADITION SEALED BEAM LIGHT, THE COST TO REPLACE WOULD BE $10.  THE DETERIATION IS ALSO VERY SUTTLE.  YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT THE LUMENS THE LIGHT ARE PROVIDING IS BEING REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE SUTTLE CHANGE IN THE LENS COVER OVERTIME.  THE LENS COVER CHANGES SO THAT IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THE HALOGEN BULB PROVIDES TO LIGHTING THE ROAD.  I NOTICED THIS CHANGE WHEN I WENT FROM DIRVING THE 92 CROWN VICTORIA TO MY NEW DODGE DACODA ON SOME BACK ROADS ON VERY DARK NIGHTS.  I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OF THE LENS COVERS NEED TO ADDRESS TO ASSURE THAT THEY WILL NOT DETERIORATE OVER TIME AND CAUSE THIS VISIBITY PROBLEM,  FORD SHOULD BE MADE RESPONSIBLE TO INSURE THE PLASTIC FOR THESE LENS ARE AS GOOD AS THE GLASS WAS FOR THE SEALED BEAM LIGHTS.  I KNOW THE DOT ALLOWED THE CAR MANUFACTURER THE ABILITY  NOT TO USE THE SEALED BEAM TO PROVIDE THE BENEFIT OF THE HALOGEN BULBS BRIGHTNESS, LESS ENERGY USED PER LUMIN, AND TO ALLOW A MORE GAS EFFENTS DESIGNS.
