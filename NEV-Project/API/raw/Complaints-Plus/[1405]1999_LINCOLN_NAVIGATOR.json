IT WAS AS IF IT WAS OUT OF GAS. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO A LINCOLN DEALERSHIP, AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A WINDSHIELD LEAK AND IT LEAKED ON THE GEM MODULE AND FUSE BOX HARNESS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.     I TALKED TO A AUTO GLASS EXPERT WHO TOLD ME THAT EVENTHOUGH THE DEALER WAS STATING THAT THE LEAK IS FROM THE WINDSHIELD, IT IS NOT.

FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A COSTLY ($1,800.00) REPAIR, IT IS MY PRAYER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL STEP IN AND MAKE THIS AUTO MAKER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ISSUE A RECALL AND HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED, IT MAY NOT BE LEAKAGE FROM THE WINDSHIELD, AND SUBSEQUENTLY FIXED.

AS SHE TURNED, SHE HEARD A POPPING SOUND, THEN SHE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THE CAR.  WHEN I ARRIVED, I NOTICED THAT THE SWAY BAR PIN AND THE TIE ROD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WERE DISCONNECTED FROM THE WHEEL.  I INSPECTED THE AREA AROUND THE CAR AND FOUND NO POT HOLES OR CURBS CLOSE TO THE VICINITY OF VEHICLE.   IT WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL LINCOLN DEALER AND THE REPLACED THE PARTS UNDER WARRANTY WITHOUT MUCH EXPLANATION OTHER THAN MY WIFE MUST HAVE HIT A CURB.  THEY ONLY REPLACED THE DAMAGE COMPONENTS AND REPORTED THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS INSPECTED BUT LOOKED FINE.    THE SECOND INCIDENT JUST OCCURED A WEEK PRIOR TO THIS COMPLAINT. MY WIFE WAS TRAVELING TO HER JOB AND WAS MOVING AT A SPEED OF APPROX. 20 MILES AN HOUR. SHE WAS IN THE LEFT LANE WHEN THE CAR BEGAN TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND BOUNCE.   SHE WAS PULLED INTO THE LEFT LANE OF ONCOMING CARS, SO SHE DID NOT STOP THE CAR, BUT RATHER LET THE CAR TAKE HER INTO A SIDE STREET.  A POLICE OFFICER WITNESSED THE INCIDENT AND WHEN I ARRIVED WE FOUND THE SWAY BAR PIN AND TIE ROD TO BE DISCONNECTED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  WE HAD A TOW TRUCK PICK UP THE TRUCK AND HAD THE ENTIRE FRONT SUSPENSION AND WHEELS CHECKED FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGE.
