THERE ARE HOLES IN THE FRAME CAUSED BY THE FRAME CRACKING. THE CRACKS APPEAR TO HAVE BEGAN SOME TIME AGO AS THERE IS RUST DEVELOPING IN THE CRACKS. THE CRACKS ARE LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL SECTION OF THE MAIN I-BEAMS OF FRAME WHERE THE CROSS BRACES ARE WELDED TO THE MAIN PART OF THE FRAME. THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE FRAME IN SEVERELY COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF THE POOR ENGINEERING AND FABRICATION. PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I CAN PROVIDE PHOTOGRAPHS.",
