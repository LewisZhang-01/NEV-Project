TO DATE, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE MY WATERPUMP, INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, TIRES, BRAKES AND ROTORS CONSISTENTLY (THREE OR MORE TIMES AYEAR) . THE  MOST RECENT PROBLEM IS MY GAS GAUGE WILL INDICATE THAT I HAVE 1/4 TANK AND TO MY SURPRISE THE CAR WILL NOT START UNLESS MORE FUEL IS ADDED. THE ENGINE ALSO SOUNDS ROUGH, I HAVE BOTH SERVICE ENGINE LIGHTS ON, ALONG WITH MY LOW TIRE PRESSURE, ANTI LOCK BRAKE LIGHT ON AND I HAVE NEW TIRES, REPLACED A GAS CAP, AND THE LIGHTS WENT OFF, BUT THEN COME BACK ON. I AM ALSO POSITIVE THAT MY CAR WILL NOT PASS INSPECTION. THE COSMETIC DEFECTS ARE THAT OF THE DASH BOARD STARTING TO PEEL AND COME LOOSE. I HAVE READ UP ON THAT GM RESPONDED TO A PROBLEM WITH ALL 2000 OLDSMOBILE ALEROS ABOUT THE GAS PROBLEM AND I CONTACTED THE DEALER DORSCHEL AND SPOKE WITH SERVICE MANAGER LOU, GM AGREED TO ADD A DIFFERENT FILTER SO THAT THE GAS WAS DRAINING BACK INTO THE TANK, IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE THAT DEALERS COULD BE FINED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS DAILY IF NOT COMPLIED WITH, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AN ACTUAL RECALL, THE DEALER DENIED MY REQUEST TO FIX. AFTER READING THE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE VEHICLES, I AM SHOCKED THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RECALLED, THE SHOULD BE AS THEY ARE NOT SAFE CARS IN MY OPINION. I AM CHALLENGING YOU TO TAKE A RIDE IN MY CAR WITH YOUR FAMILY AND SEE IF YOU FEEL SAFE, BECAUSE NOT ONLY AM I OUT 13,000 THAT I PAID FOR THE CAR, BUT ALSO IF I HAVE TO ESTIMATE PROBABLY ANOTHER 6,000 IN REPAIRS. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. I EXPECT A WRITTEN RESPONSE FROM YOUR OFFICE WITHIN 30 DAYS OF WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO TO INVESTIGATE THESE PROBLEMS. NOT ONLY READ MY LETTER, BUT YOU SHOULD GOOGLE IN 2000 OLDSMOBILE ALEROS AND SEE THE DISGUST OF PERFORMANCE PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING OF.  *TR",

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE - IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN THE CAR IS WORTH AT THIS POINT DUE TO THE DEFECT IN WORKMANSHIP.  I THEN CONTACTED DAVID AT SYMDOM CHEVROLET, BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET ANY MORE SATISFACTION FROM GM.  I THEN CONTACTED BRIAN AT BURTNESS CHEVROLET.  HE SPOKE TO HIS REP, BUT I STILL HAVE HAD NO RESPONSE FROM HIS REP.  I DON'T FEEL THIS IS AN EXPENSE I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY.  IT'S AN OBVIOUS DEFECT ON THAT PARTICULAR COLOR AND TYPE OF VINYL/LEATHER.  THE OTHER COLORS OF THE VINYL/LEATHER ARE FINE.  THERE'S HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET - NO ONE THAT KNOWS WOULD EVER BY AN ALERO!  THE LEAST THEY COULD DO IS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.  IF THIS ISN'T RESOLVED, I DON'T THINK OUR FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO BUY GM CARS - WE HAVE 4 IN THE FAMILY RIGHT NOW, AND HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT GM.  NO WONDER GM IS HAVING SO MANY PROBLEMS - THERE'S NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  *NM",

THE DEALER COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT SUGGESTED I MAY NEED NEW BRAKES. I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS RESPONSE SINCE THE CAR WAS LESS THAN ONE YEAR OLD AND I DON'T DRIVE ANY MORE THAN THE AVERAGE DRIVER.   I THEN STARTED TAKING IT TO A CLOSER DEALER (THIS ONE WAS A GM DEALER AND NOT SPECIFICALLY OLDSMOBILE). AFTER SEVERAL VISITS THEY TOLD ME MY BRAKE PADS WERE WORN DOWN AND NEEDED REPLACED. BY THIS POINT IT WAS 2002 AND MY CAR HAD ABOUT 20,000 MILES ON IT. I STILL WASN'T SURE I AGREED WITH IT, BUT I LET THEM REPLACE MY BRAKES. STILL HEARD THE NOISE. I CAN'T EVEN COUNT HOW MANY TIMES MY CAR HAS BEEN TO THE TWO DEALERSHIPS FOR THE SAME GRINDING NOISE.   THE LAST TIME I HAD IT IN WAS IN MAY OF 2003. THEY FINALLY TOLD ME ABOUT A BULLETIN REGARDING TIRE SIZE AND TOLD ME THIS WAS CAUSING THE NOISE. THIS BULLETIN CAME OUT A YEAR PRIOR TO THIS SERVICE VISIT AND THEY HAD LOOKED AT MY CAR NUMEROUS TIMES.  NOW I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE ROTORS AND FROM WHAT I'VE READ A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE TOO. WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES, IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS JERKING TO A STOP.

THE GEAR SHIFTER POPPED INTO NEUTRAL...(ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN LESS THEN ABOUT 10 SECONDS)... WHICH DROPPED THE CAR FROM 70 MPH TO 50-55 MPH, WHICH IN TURN MADE THE SUV THAT JUMPED INTO MY LANE BEHIND ME TO ACCELERATE WAS AWARE ENOUGH TO HIT HIS BRAKES AND THEN VERE OFF TO THE OTHER LANE...THANK GOD THAT THE ONLY THING I GOT FROM THE OTHER DRIVER WAS AN UPSET FACIAL EXPRESSION INSTEAD OF HIS FRONT BUMPER ON TOP OF MY KIDS IN THE BACKSEAT....WELL AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO AN DEALERSHIP IN VA BEACH, VA. FOR SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS, ALL I WAS OFFERED WAS WRITTEN EXCUSES---BUT NOTHING WAS FIXED...SO I DECIDED TO CALL THE OLDSMOBILE COMPANY, AFTER THEY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THEY JUST REPEATED THE EXCUSES OF WHAT WAS THE WRITTEN EXCUSES THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME THE FIRST TIME....SO I TOLD THE MAN I UNDERSTAND THAT HE JUST WORKS THERE AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE ( I GUESS) TRIED TO HELP ME. BUT WHAT IF THIS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TURN FOR THE WORST. ALL HE SAID WAS \"WELL IT'S NOW DOCUMENTED, IN CASE OF A FUTURE FATALITY\" ----IF YOU ASK ME, THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE.
