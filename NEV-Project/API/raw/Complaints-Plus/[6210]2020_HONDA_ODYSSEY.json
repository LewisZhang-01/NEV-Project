Issue with doors, van beeps twice when walking away from vehicle, like one is not shut properly even after you open and shut all doors again. Also rear sliding doors don\u2019t shut sometimes and act like there is something in the way of it closing and reopening. Available anytime on Friday for inspection. Safety issue only with backup camera. Prefer the convenience of having one to see behind me better. Mirrors ok but camera better.  Problem was fixed twice at Honda dealership in Jonesboro Ar. They said it was a recall. The solution to the recall only fixed it temporarily though. The same above issues continue to reoccur even after repair.  Scheduled and went into Honda for the third time for the same issue and the dealership sent me away. This time they said they wouldn\u2019t be able to fix again until someone (an engineer) from corporate could come out and look at my car. This hasn\u2019t occurred and it\u2019s been over two months. They said they have a new service manager and they are looking into it. I\u2019ve called a number of times and I am just told their new and their trying to figure out who to contact.  Issues started out with popping and crackling noise in speakers. Then the touchscreen monitor would say no audio connection. The rear tv would go on and off too.  Then the touchscreen just died and nothing works now. It doesn\u2019t even turn on. Just black screen. So I have a non-working touchscreen, navigation, radio, back up camera, heat/air adjustments, all components on the touchscreen are non-working. USB ports are non-working. Rear tv is non-working.",

THEN, THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM STARTED RANDOMLY POWERING DOWN, USUALLY FIRST DISPLAYING A MESSAGE \"NETWORK COMMUNICATION LOST\". SOMETIMES IT WILL COME BACK ON, SOMETIMES IT CANNOT BE RESTARTED FOR DAYS AT A TIME. (WHEN IT DOES COME BACK ON, THERE USUALLY IS A POPPING SOUND COMING FROM THE SPEAKERS). THIS HAPPENS AT RANDOM, IRREGARDLESS IF THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION OR NOT. BESIDES FOR NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE DRIVING, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, BECAUSE WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE BACKUP CAMERA DOES NOT WORK EITHER. SO, YOU HAVE A LARGE VEHICLE (I.E. A MINIVAN) WITH MINIMAL REAR VISIBILITY, WHICH IS USUALLY USED AROUND CHILDREN, AND YOU HAVE NO WAY OF SEEING WHAT'S BEHIND YOU. I BROUGHT THIS TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS. I SPOKE TO AMERICAN HONDA AND THEY ALSO SAID THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.

THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT DISTRACTS THE DRIVER AND ALSO PREVENTS USAGE OF THE BACKUP CAMERA.
