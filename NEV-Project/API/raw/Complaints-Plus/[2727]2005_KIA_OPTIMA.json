I'VE HAD TO DO THAT WHEN I HAD NO ONE TO CALL FOR HELP. IT'S SO DANGEROUS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR WHEN YOU'RE READY. ITS ALSO HORRIBLE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR VEHICLE NOT BEING THERE WHEN YOU COME OUTSIDE BECAUSE YOU LEFT YOUR DOORS UNLOCKED FOR A CAR THIEF. IF I OPEN MY PASSENGER SIDE DOOR AND PRESS LOCK AND CLOSE IT.

FINDING OUT THIS WAS GOING TO RUN ME ABOUT 300-400 DOLLARS I WAITED TO SEE IF IT WAS SOMETHING I COULD FIX... MY FRIEND AND I REMOVED BOTH PANELS AFTER HAVING TO SLIM JIM AND PUSH AND PULL THE DOOR OPEN. WE LOOKED AT BOTH DOOR INSIDES AND SAW NO DIFFERENCE AND NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO BE BROKEN, BENT OR UNATTACHED.  OF COARSE AS I DROVE A WAY MY LOCKS LOCKED AGAIN.. SO I WAS BACK TO CLIMBING OUT MY PASSENGER SIDE. AS OF YESTERDAY MY PASSENGER SIDE IS NOW DOING THE SAME THING.. THEY SAY IM UP TO 500 NOW AND NOTHING IS COVERED BY WARRANTY.  IM THINKING, REALLY!!?? THIS IS THE SECOND KIA I HAVE PURCHASED AND HAVE ALWAYS LOVED MY KIA'S BUT THIS SUCKS!  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE STUCK IN THERE CAR ON FIRE OR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER DYING BEFORE KIA RECALLS THIS.  I'VE READ SEVERAL POSTS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH KIDS OR PEOPLE THAT ARE \"TOO BIG\" TO GO CLIMB OVER THEIR CAR SEATS TO SAFETY!  AT THIS POINT THE ONLY WAY IN AND OUT OF MY CAR IS NOW THE BACK DOORS BUT FOR HOW LONG, WHO KNOWS!  WHAT'S NEXT, SQUEEZE THROUGH THE GLOVE BOX?  OKAY, OKAY SO THAT'S NOT REALISTIC BUT JEEZ!

WE CALLED KIA AND THEY TOLD UP THAT OUR WARRANTY WAS UP, BUT WE COULD HAVE IT TOWED, BUT THEY SAID THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COME OUT AND EMPTY THE TANK BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE A FIRE AND THEY WOULD NOT TOW IT.

THE IMPACT OCCURED ON THE RIGHT-SIDE FRONT BUMPER, RESULTING IN THE FRONT BEING SHOVED, ACCORDIAN STYLE, TOWARDS THE DRIVERS WINDOW.  THIS IMPACT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO THROW ROBERTA INTO THE WINDSHIELD CAUSING A MINOR BUMP TO APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF HER HEAD, BECAUSE THE AIRBAG IN THE VEHICLE DID NOT DEPLOY.  ROBERTA WAS WEARING HER SEATBELT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  SHE SUFFERS FROM CONTUSIONS AND SPRAINS ON BOTH OF HER KNEES, HER GLUTOS MAXIMUS AND RIGHT ARM.
