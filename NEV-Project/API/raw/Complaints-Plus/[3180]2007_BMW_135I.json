THIS NEW REPLACED JUST FAILED AND BMW SAID THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY  EXTENDED FROM THE YEAR THE VEHICLE WAS MADE AND NOT THE ACTUAL REPLACE NEW FUEL PUMP.  A COMPLETE DECEPTIVE MARKETING BY BMW'.  I WAS TOLD THE NEW FUEL PUMP WOULD HAVE A 10 YEAR WARRANTY.  BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  THE NEW REPLACED FUEL PUMP STOPPED IN TRAFFIC CAUSING SERIOUS ISSUES.  LUCKILY NO ACCIDENT.",
