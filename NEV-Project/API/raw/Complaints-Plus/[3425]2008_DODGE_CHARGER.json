INSTEAD, THE KEY ENDS UP BETWEEN THE \"ON\" AND \"START\" POSITION. IN THAT CASE, THE WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER AND WINDSHIELD WIPERS WON'T WORK.

I HAVE BEEN STRANDED SEVERAL TIMES DUE TO THIS ISSUE SOMETIMES FOR 20 MINUTES AT A TIME.   THIS PAST WEDNESDAY AS I DROVE HOME FROM WORK ON A VERY HIGH SPEED EXPRESSWAY, MY VEHICLE SHUT OFF COMPLETELY.  IT RESTARTED ON IT'S OWN ONCE AND THEN ALL SYSTEMS SHUT DOWN, LEAVING ME COASTING IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO ROLL TO A STOP SAFELY.  I CALLED MY ROADSIDE SERVICE AND WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP.  THE NEXT DAY I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT IT WAS NOT THE \"RECALL\" ISSUE THAT CAUSED THIS BUT A SHORT IN A WIRE THAT CAUSED THE ALTERNATOR TO FAIL COMPLETELY .  I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD BE CHARGED FOR THE REPAIR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY MY WARRANTY WOULD COVER THE REPAIR EXCEPT MY 200.00 DEDUCTIBLE.  BEING THAT THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION I AUTHORIZED IT.  THE REPAIR WAS DONE AND MY VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME ON FRIDAY JUL 17, 2015.

DODGE FINALLY REPLACED THE PART ( I CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME BUT IT WAS ON BACK ORDER). I STARTED HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM LESS THAN 6 MONTHS LATER AND THE PART WAS REPLACED AGAIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, APPROXIMATELY LATE JANUARY, I RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE FOR THE IGNITION SWITCH AND CALLED DODGE. THEY SAID THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER AND THEY WEREN'T SURE WHEN THEY WOULD RECEIVE THE PART. SINCE THEN, I HAVE LOST THE LIGHTING ON MY DASH FOR THE HEADLIGHTS AND AIR-CONDITIONING/HEATING DIALS. THIS OCCURRED WHEN I STARTED MY CAR AND IT SUDDENLY TURNED OFF. I CALLED IN REGARDS TO FINALLY HAVING THE LIGHTING FIXED TODAY AND THAT PART WAS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, IS THE IGNITION SWITCH, I HAVE TROUBLE STARTING THE CAR, SOME DAYS WORSE THAN OTHERS. I ALSO HAVE TO CHECK THE KEY BY TAPPING IT  WHEN IT'S STARTED TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE \"RUN\" POSITION. A HANDFUL OF TIMES I'VE TAPPED IT AND THE KEY HAS TURNED BACK TO THE LEFT, KILLING THE CAR. THANKFULLY I'VE BEEN PARKED EVERY TIME. I'VE CALLED DODGE ABOUT THIS RECALL AND THEY STILL HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE PART AND HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD A DEFINITE DATE AS TO WHEN THEY WILL RECEIVE THE PART. THIS ISSUE IS NOT ONLY FRUSTRATING IT'S DANGEROUS FOR ME AND ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD. I'M TIRED OF CALLING DODGE ONLY TO HEAR EVERY PART I NEED IS ON BACKORDER. I TRULY DON'T BELIEVE THE CAR I'M DRIVING IS SAFE ANYMORE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE RECALL LETTER STATES. I THINK DODGE IS AN AWFUL COMPANY WHO HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LEAVES THE LOCAL DEALERSHIPS WITH THEIR HANDS TIED. I TRULY BELIEVE THEY ARE ONLY DAYS AWAY FROM A LAWSUIT.   *TR",

THE KEY FAILS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE IGNITION KEY SWITCH. THE KEY SWITCH CANNOT BE TURNED TO THE \"OFF\" POSITION TO BE REMOVED AND STAYS STUCK IN THE \"ACCESSORY\" POSITION. THIS IS A REAL SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE KEY MUST BE LEFT IN THE IGNITION SWITCH OPENING THE POSSIBILITY TO VEHICLE THEFT OR ANY CHILD OR OTHER PASSERBY MAKING ENTRY INTO THE VEHICLE AND STARTING & DRIVING AWAY. LEAVING THE KEY \"ON\" IN THE ACCESSORY POSITION SUBSEQUENTLY DRAINS THE BATTERY, AFTER ONLY A MATTER OF HOURS THE BATTERY IS DEAD AND LEAVES THE OWNER REPEATEDLY STRANDED. LEAVING THE ACCESSORY CIRCUITS ENERGIZED FOR LONG PERIODS ALSO INCREASES THE CHANCES OF A VEHICLE FIRE.    I TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL DODGE DEALER IN LUMBERTON NJ, THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A DEFECTIVE WIN MODULE. I PAID FOR THE REMOVAL & INSTALLATION OF A NEW WIN MODULE AND THE CAR EXHIBITS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM AS BEFORE. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT VERIFIED THAT IT'S STILL OCCURRING AND HAD TO ARGUE WITH THEM FOR A REFUND ONLY TO BE GIVEN DEALER CREDIT.    THE DEALER THEN SHOWED ME A DODGE ENGINEER'S SERVICE BULLETIN DESCRIBING THIS ISSUE PERFECTLY. OFTEN THESE SYMPTOMS ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF A WIN MODULE BUT IF THE WIN IS NOT AT FAULT,  DODGE STATES THAT THE \"ESM\" MODULE (ELECTRONIC SHIFT MODULE) IS AT FAULT AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THE ESM IS LOCATED ON THE STEERING COLUMN IN A 2008 DODGE CHARGER 5.7L RWD POLICE PACKAGE CAR AND IS CONNECTED TO THE COLUMN SHIFT GEAR SELECTOR.    THE DODGE DEALER STATES THE ESM MODULE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR REPLACEMENT AND THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN MUST BE REPLACED DUE TO THE PART NOT AVAILABLE FOR SALE SEPARATELY. EVERY OTHER MODULE FOR THE CHARGER IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE EXCEPT THE ESM AND DODGE SERVICE WANTS $2400 TO NEEDLESSLY REPLACE THE ENTIRE COLUMN. *JB",

I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DODGE DEALERSHIP, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE CLOSED DUE TO THE HOLIDAYS. LUCKY I WAS ABLE TO BRING MY 2008 DODGE CHARGER TO TIRE KINGDOM. THE MANAGER OF TIRE KINGDOM IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AND STATED THAT MY COOLING FAN BROKE OFF CAUSING THE BROKEN PIECES OF THE FAN TO FLY INTO MY RADIATOR WHICH CAUSED MY RADIATOR DAMAGE AND LEFT A HOLE IN MY RADIATOR. ADDITIONALLY I HAD TO PAY $571.36 TO REPAIR MY 2008 DODGE CHARGER AND THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS ON TOP OF THAT.
