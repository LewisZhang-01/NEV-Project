HOWEVER, ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, I CAME OUT TO UNLOCK MY CAR AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO STICK MY KEY IN THE DOOR LOCK. THE KEY WOULD NO LONGER TURN. AT FIRST, THIS ISSUE WAS ONLY WITH THE DRIVERS SIDE LOCK; HOWEVER, IT NOW INCLUDES BOTH THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE PASSENGER SIDE LOCKS. FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED ON THE ISSUE, IT SEEMS THAT THE CYLINDER COMPONENT OF BOTH THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE PASSENGER SIDE EXTERIOR DOOR LOCKS IS TO BLAME. IN MY RESEARCH, I CAME ACROSS SEVERAL FORUMS (MOST OF THEM BEING HONDA FORUMS) IN WHICH OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE SAME 2007 BASE MODELS OF HONDA FITS INCLUDING THE 08' FITS. I DID TAKE IT TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM CHECK OUT THE ISSUE. THEY DID CONFIRM THAT IT WAS THE CYLINDER THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, THEY STATED THAT THE CAUSE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ATTEMPTING TO JAM SOMETHING INTO MY CAR DOOR LOCK IN ORDER TO BREAK IN. ALTHOUGH THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A POSSIBLE CAUSE, I FEEL THAT IF SEVERAL OTHERS WITH THE SAME MODEL AND YEAR OF HONDA ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE THEN IT ISN'T SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO MY HONDA OR THAT SOMEONE WAS MERELY TRYING TO BREAK IN. IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE. THE ONLY WAY I AM ABLE TO ENTER MY CAR AT THE MOMENT IS THROUGH THE TRUNK. IF MY KEY STOPS WORKING FOR THAT LOCK THEN I HAVE NO WAY TO GET INTO MY CAR. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FOR SAFETY AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS ONE'S OWN VEHICLE.",

BECAUSE THE PROBLEM CONTINUES, AND ENDANGERS MY SAFETY, I WENT ONLINE TO SEEK HELP, AND UNCOVERED MANY OTHER HONDA FIT OWNERS PLAGUED BY THIS SAME ISSUE, WHO HAD LOGGED THEIR COMPLAINTS AT WWW.FITFREAK.NET, SO I KNOW THIS IS NOT A FLUKE; IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE HONDA FIT.

NOT SURE IF IT IS RELATED TO THE ENGINE SURGE I AM WORRIED ABOUT NOW (MARCH 2015)  ACCOMPANIED BY MY PADDLE SHIFTERS NOT WORKING WHILE IN D MODE. I EXPERIENCED THIS WHEN ACCELERATING AT 20MPH AND AGAIN AT 35MPH MY ENGINE HAD HIGH RPMS THE ENGINE SOUNDED LIKE IT SURGED AND MADE A THUD AS THOUGH THE ENGINE WOULD FALL OUT OF MY CAR. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS TO CONTINUE DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC AS EACH TIME I ACCELERATED IT HAPPENED AGAIN AT 20 MPH. AT MY DESTINATION FOR TWO HOURS I THEN DROVE HOME WITH SOME HILLS AND WINDING ROADS AND PUT MY CAR IN S MODE TO SEE IF PADDLE SHIFTERS WOULD WORK OR RESET IN SOME MANNER, WHICH IT DID START WORKING. THE SURGING CEASED TO HAPPEN IN S MODE SO I DECIDED TO SHIFT INTO D MODE TO SEE IF PADDLE SHIFTERS WOULD WORK PROPERLY AND THEY DID AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE HOME FORTY MINUTES. THE ORANGE ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON AND PADDLE SHIFTERS SEEM TO BE WORKING IN BOTH S AND D MODE NOW WONDERING WHAT TO GET CHECKED OUT. SINCE I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY ON THE MAJOR SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THE CAR SHOULD WORK WELL FOR THE NEXT 150,000 IT'S NOW NEAR 148,000 MILES I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER I CAN COUNT ON THE PADDLE SHIFTERS OR IF THEY WILL FAIL ME AGAIN. THE ENGINE WARNING LIGHT USUALLY TURNS OFF ONCE I GET AN OIL CHANGE AND RESET IT HAS REMAINED ON. I DON'T KNOW IF A DIAGNOSTIC WILL REVEAL ANYTHING OR IF I SHOULD JUST GET THE PADDLE SHIFTERS CHECKED.

IN ORDER FOR THE PRESSURE PLATE DIAPHRAGM SPRINGS TO HAVE BENT, ONE OF TWO THINGS MUST HAVE OCCURRED:   1. THE DIAPHRAGM SPRINGS WERE DAMAGED DURING ASSEMBLY. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THEN THE DAMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPARENT WHEN THE CAR WAS NEW, NOT SOME 76,000 MILES LATER. IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ON THE CLUTCH (M41L 11 23/50) SHOULD PROVE THAT THIS CLUTCH WAS THE ORIGINAL AND HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED.     2. THE DIAPHRAGM SPRINGS OF THE CLUTCH LOST THEIR SPRING TENSION. THIS TO ME SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION. THIS COULD BE DUE TO DEFECTS IN THE STEEL ITSELF OR IMPROPER HEAT-TREATING. I BELIEVE THAT A SERIES OF BRINELL HARDNESS TESTS AT VARIOUS DEPTHS WOULD PROVE THAT THE CLUTCH DIAPHRAGM SPRINGS ARE TOO SOFT AND THAT THIS CONDITION THAT ULTIMATELY CAUSED THE CLUTCH TO FAIL.  *TR",

WHEN THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IS BELOW APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES F, THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING MODULE RELAY MAKES A STRANGE CLICKING BUZZING SOUND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINE STARTS.  THE POWER STEERING WARNING INDICATOR LIGHT STAYS ILLUMINATED ON THE DASH AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS VERY STIFF AND DIFFICULT TO MOVE.  THE CONDITION CAN BE REMEDIED BY TURNING THE KEY TO THE OFF POSITION, WAITING A FEW SECONDS AND TRYING AGAIN, ALTHOUGH THIS CYCLE MAY HAVE TO BE REPEATED A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE THE POWER STEERING COMES BACK ON.  DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING ACTIVE IS DANGEROUS AS IT'S OBVIOUS THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE HIGHLY ASSISTED.  YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE STRANDED BY THIS ISSUE.  APPARENTLY IT'S A COMMON ONE, SO MUCH SO THAT HONDA HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR IT WHICH CALLS FOR REPLACING THE EPS MODULE AT A COST OF $700+.  LUCKILY I HAVEN'T HAD IT FAIL WHILE DRIVING BUT I'M AFRAID IT COULD AS IT HAS FOR OTHERS.  IT'S OBVIOUS WITH THE FREQUENCY OF THIS ISSUE THAT THERE WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN THE EPS MODULE WHICH SHOULD WARRANT A RECALL.  *TR",

CALLED HONDA CUST SERVICE (800-999-1009), BUT WAS TOLD THAT SINCE IT'S OUT OF THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD, AND NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I JUST TOOK MY CAR TO THE HONDA DEALER TO HAVE THE EPS MODULE REPLACED ($700 + LABOR), SINCE I DO NOT WANT TO RISK DRIVING KNOWING THAT THE STEERING CAN GO OUT AT ANY MOMENT.

WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED ON ANY KIND IF INCLINE AND IT RAINS, WATER ENTERS THE CAR VIA THE DEFECTIVE DOOR SEALS AND SOAKS INTO THE REAR CARPETS CAUSING EXTENSIVE MOLD DAMAGE TO THE CARPETS AND SEALS. WATER ALSO FILLS THE REAR SPARE TIRE WELL. THIS OCCURS EVERY TIME THE CAR IS PARKED IN THE RAIN. I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THIS WITH MY 2007 HONDA FIT, AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER HONDA FIT OWNERS REPORTING THE SAME ISSUE EITHER IN PERSON OR ONLINE. IN THE US HONDA DO NOT ADMIT IT IS AN ISSUE, DESPITE VARIOUS HONDA DEALERS IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM. IN EUROPE AND JAPAN HONDA HAVE ATTEMPTED REMEDY WITH THE HONDA JAZZ - VIRTUALLY THE SAME CAR.  THIS LEAK HAS CAUSED ME BREATHING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS. IT HAS REDUCED THE VALUE OF MY VEHICLE AND IS A DANGER TO MY PREGNANT WIFE AND MY UNBORN CHILD.  DESPITE MY AND OTHERS EFFORTS TO BRING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF HONDA USA, THEY HAVE IGNORED ALL ATTEMPTS AND WILL NOT OFFER ME ANY ASSISTANCE. I HAVE WASTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY TRYING TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE THROUGH HONDA.  A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ISSUED FOR THIS ISSUE. IT WOULD BE THE FOURTH ISSUED FOR THIS CAR, AND TWO OF THE PREVIOUS RECALLS ARE LINKED TO WATER LEAKS OR WATER DAMAGE.

ALL THE POSTERS THAT I HAVE SEEN ON FITFREAK.NET HAVE SHOWN THAT HONDA DOES NOT SEE THIS ISSUE AS BEING A DEFECT AND IS ACTUALLY CHARGING PEOPLE TO FIX WHAT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE.

THERE WAS A LATE MODEL TOYOTA TUNDRA PICKUP TRUCK INFRONT OF MY CAR AND IT CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP.  I COULDN'T STOP QUICK ENOUGH- I WAS TRAVELING AT LOW SPEED MUST BE UNDER 15MPH.  MY CAR HIT THE BUMPER OF THE PICK UP TRUCK INFRONT OF ME AND THE HOOD, LIGHTS AND ENTIRE \"TOP\" FRONT END SUSTAINED ABOUT \"$7000\" WORTH OF DAMAGE.  BUT NONE OF THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AT ALL.  LOTS OF LIGHTS ON THE GAUGE CLUSTER CAME ON AND WENT OFF BUT THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  THE TUNDRA ONLY SUSTAINED A SCRATCH ON THE REAR BUMPER.    AFTER A TEAR DOWN BY THE BODY SHOP IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SENSORS WERE INSTALLED AT THE SIDES AT THE FRONT END OF THE FRAME RAIL.  THIS IS A VERY LOW POSITION ON THIS CAR SINCE ITS ALREADY LOW TO THE GROUND.  I BELIEVE THE AIRBAG SENSORS ARE TOO LOW ON THESE CARS BY POOR AND IRRESPONSIBLE DESIGN BY HONDA.  HAD THESE SENSORS BEEN PLACED AT A HIGHER ELEVATION THEN THE AIRBAGS WOULD HAVE GONE OFF AND THE INJURIES WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MINOR.      THIS DESIGN DECISION SEEMS LIKE IT WAS DEVELOPED TO SATISFY THE FRONTAL CRASH TESTS CONDUCTED BY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY.  DURING THOSE TESTS THE CARS ARE EVALUATED FOR CRASHES TO A SOLID OBJECT ANCHORED TO THE GROUND.  THE AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN A CRASH SCENARIO WITH ANY VEHICLE THAT WOULD NOT BE  A COMPACT CAR.  I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LOSS OF LIFE BUT THE SAME ACCIDENT AT A HIGHER SPEED WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN NO AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT AND CERTAIN LOSS OF LIFE.     THE CAR IS CURRENTLY BEING REPAIRED AT A BODY SHOP IN LORTON VA.    I EXTEND YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND STUDY THE CAR IF YOU CARE TO DO SO...    THANKS SO MUCH  SHAZAD BUKSH  *TR",
