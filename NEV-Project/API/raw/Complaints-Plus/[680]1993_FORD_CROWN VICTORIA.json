LOOKING UNDER THE CAR REVEALED THAT THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT HAD SEPARATED AND PULLED FREE FROM THE CONTROL ARM.  THE LOWER CONTROL ARM HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE AND GOUGED A HUGE HOLE IN IT.  HAD THIS HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC WITH LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE EXPOSED BALL JOINT END WAS DRY (NO LUBRICANT) AND I COULD SEE GALLING ON THE UPPER TOP HALF OF THE \"BALL\".  THESE ARE  SEALED BALL JOINTS THAT HAVE NO GREASE FITTING AND THUS NO PROVISION FOR LUBRICATION.   THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED. IT IS SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY AT THIS TIME AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION BY ANYONE.  I LOOKED UP RECALLS ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND NHTSA RECALL HISTORY LISTING \"1992-99: BEARING WITHIN LOWER BALL JOINT CAN WEAKEN SLOWLY DURING USE AND EVENTUALLY CRACK; COULD RESULT IN SEPARATION, ALLOWING CONTROL ARM TO DROP TO THE GROUND\" AND ELSEWHERE RECALL NO. 1998251 REFERS TO CROWN VICTORIA \" BEARING LOADS CAN LEAD TO THINNING AND EVENTUAL CRACKING OF THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT\" .
