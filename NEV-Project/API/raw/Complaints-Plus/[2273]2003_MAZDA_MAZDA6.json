THAT ISSUE IS PROBLEMATIC BUT RELATIVELY MINOR; HOWEVER, THERE IS A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS ISSUE THE FAULTY THROTTLE BODY CREATES. WHEN DRIVING AT ANY SPEED, THE FAULTY THROTTLE BODY CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO CUT OUT WITHOUT WARNING. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING WITH OUR KIDS IN THE CAR THE FIRST TIME WE HAD THE ENGINE CUT OUT WHILE DRIVING (SOON AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR). LUCKILY, SHE WAS DRIVING IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA AT 25 MPH.    THE ENGINE HAS CUT OUT ON ME WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY. I WAS FORCED TO COAST THROUGH FREEWAY TRAFFIC TO THE SHOULDER IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR AND RESTART THE ENGINE.

AS THE SERVICE ADVISOR QUOTED ME PRICES, I TOLD HER I CAN BUY A PCM ONLINE FOR 145. SHE SAID, YES, YOU CAN DO THAT, BUT WE WON'T WARRANTY THE JOB BECAUSE IT'S NOT OUR PART. I TOLD THEM ARE YOU SURE THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM? THEY SAID YES. I TOLD THEM OKAY FINE! CONSTANTLY CALLING THE DEALERSHIP FOR 2 WEEKS ASKING WHEN I WAS GOING TO GET MY CAR BACK, THEY GAVE ME A LOANER. I HAD THAT FOR A WEEK, SO THEY HAD MY CAR A TOTAL OF 3 WEEKS. FINALLY I CALLED AGAIN, I ASKED THEM WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY CAR. THEY TOLD ME, I NEED A NEW ENGINE. I WAS LIKE WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED TO 2K WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM? THEY SAID NO, THERE'S TOO MUCH SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE, YOU NEED A NEW ONE. UPSET, I'M ALREADY IN FOR 2K AND NOW THEY WANT ME TO SPEND ANOTHER 5K FOR A NEW ENGINE. MIND YOU, I WAS ALREADY HESITANT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE OF THE PCM. ANY WAY, SERVICE ADVISOR TELLS ME, I CAN BUY A NEW/USED ENGINE ONLINE FOR 500 AND HAVE THEM CHANGE IT. I TOLD THEM THAT WAS THE WHOLE REASON, I DIDN'T BUY THE PCM ONLINE!I WAS TOLD YOU WOULDN'T WARRANTY IT, NOW YOU WANT ME TO BUY ONE ONLINE?

EVERY DEALER I CONTACTED ABOUT IT SAID THEY'D CHARGE AN HOUR LABOR TO DO THIS, AND MY PRIVATE MECHANIC COULDN'T DO IT AS IT'S SOME MAGICAL THING ONLY THE DEALERS CAN DO.

ON AUG 12TH, 2009 I MENTIONED THIS EVENT TO A MITSUBISHI DEALER'S MECHANIC (FRIEND OF MY FATHER) WHO WAS REPLACING MY POWER STEERING LINE, HE TOOK A LOOK AT MY CAR BUT SAID IT SEEMED FINE.

HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING EMAIL IS FROM MAZDA OPERATIONS STATING IT IS INDEED RUST.  SO WHICH IS IT?  \"OCTOBER 22, 2003 OWNER NULLUNIT2000\" RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING E-MAIL FROM MAZDA AND POSTED IT IN THE RUST PROBLEM TOPIC AT MAZDA6CLUB.COM.    THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING MAZDA NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO YOU.    MAZDA NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS HAS BECOME AWARE OF A SURFACE RUST SITUATION ON THE DOORS OF CERTAIN MAZDA6 SEDANS BUILT AT THE COMPANY'S AUTO ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION FACILITY IN FLAT ROCK, MICHIGAN.  WHEN THE DOOR-SASH WEATHER-STRIPPING IS INSTALLED ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE, A SOAPY WATER SOLUTION IS USED TO EASE INSTALLATION OF THE STRIPPING INTO A CHANNEL ON THE DOOR. DURING THE AFFECTED TIME PERIOD, THAT SOAPY SOLUTION WAS FOUND TO HAVE INCLUDED A SUBSTANCE THAT HAS CAUSED SURFACE RUST TO APPEAR ON THE CHANNEL UNDERNEATH THE DOOR WEATHER-STRIPPING ON A NUMBER OF VEHICLES. THE SOLUTION HAS SINCE BEEN REPLACED, AND VEHICLES BUILT AFTER JULY 22, 2003 ARE NOT AFFECTED.    MAZDA IS WORKING ON A SERVICE PROCEDURE TO CORRECT THE SITUATION AND WILL BE NOTIFYING OWNERS OF AFFECTED VEHICLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS AN AFTERMARKET HANDSFREE KIT I HAD ADDED TO THE CAR.  BUT I PURCHASED THE CAR IN JANUARY AND HAD THE KIT ADDED IN LATE FEBRUARY, AND HAD NO PROBLEMS UP UNTIL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO (LATE MAY).  THE DEALER UNHOOKED THE HANDSFREE KIT, BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THE AFTERMARKET PRODUCT WAS THE PROBLEM.  AFTER HAVING THE KIT UNHOOKED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW, I STILL EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM.  THE KIT IS NOT EVEN HOOKED INTO THE CARS WIRING ANYWHERE, IT IS WIRED ONTO THE BATTER DIRECTLY.  THE PHONE IS NOT EVEN IN THE KIT WHILE THE CAR IS STARTING, AND THE KIT PULLS NO POWER UNLESS THE PHONE IS IN IT.",
