MY VEHICLE WILL THEN ACCELERATE AND WORK FOR A PERIOD BEFORE REPEATING THE SYMPTOMS. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ISSUE IS A PROGRAM ERROR OR A PART DEFECT. BASED ON THE ERROR CODES WHEN I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE (AUG 2016) A CERTIFIED LICENSED TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE ORIGINAL ECM MODULE WITH ONE THAT WAS PURCHASED AT A CERTIFIED TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND PROGRAMMED IT. I HAD TO TAKE MY VEHICLE BACK IN FOR SERVICE THIS MONTH (AUG 2017) SINCE THIS SAME ISSUE REOCCURRED. FORTUNATELY, IT WAS STILL COVERED UNDER THE PARTS/SERVICE WARRANTY AND A SECOND ECM MODULE FROM THE SAME DEALERSHIP WAS INSTALLED AND PROGRAMMED. HOWEVER, AFTER GETTING A TANK OF GAS TODAY, THIS HAPPENED AGAIN AS I PULLED AWAY FROM THE PUMP! AND YES, MY CAP WAS PROPERLY SECURED. I SENT AN EMAIL TO TOYOTA TO ASK HOW THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE FOR ME SINCE THIS MAY BE THE FOURTH ONE INSTALLED IN MY CAR IF I COUNT THE ORIGINAL ONE.I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT MY VEHICLE WILL FAIL WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY BETWEEN TWO SEMI TRUCKS CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO MYSELF AND/OR OTHERS.
