Afterwards, I was assured all the electronics and brake components had been checked, and I would be safe to drive everyday for work. -This week, after all these \"repaired\" recalls, my car suddenly while I was driving on one of the busiest/most dangerous highways in our area: it took me several minutes to even manage to pull onto the shoulder. During that time, I was almost hit 5 times, and had to call CHP to come take me. I could have easily been killed. and the CHP operator clearly told me not to drive this car again. -The next day, I got to Subaru dealership which sold me this car, asking for a loaner, and free repair. Although Subaru provided the loaner, they also gave me a 1133.98$ to fix the electronic issue, which they assured me \"is not my fault, but not on the recall list, so even though it malfunctioned, I have to pay, even though their negligence almost cost me my life.

FIRST: THE ENGINE STALLS AROUND 16 TO 11 MPH. THE ACCELERATION SLOWS DOWN RAPIDLY AFTER 16-15MPH THEN IT RAMPS UP AT 13MPH AND THEN SLOWS DOWN AROUND 11 MPH SPEEDS. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PERSISTENT SINCE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE VEHICLE. NHTSA NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM SINCE IT CAN BE A POTENTIAL SAFETY RISK AND CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS.     SECOND: THE BATTERY ON THIS VEHICLE WAS DEAD SUDDENLY OVER NIGHT WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE CLUES. NO MAP OR DOME LIGHTS WERE KEPT ON. THE VEHICLE WAS SWITCHED OFF PROPERLY AND NEXT MORNING THE BATTERY WAS DEAD. SOMEWHERE IN THE VEHICLE (THE SUSPECT IS INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM) THE BATTERY IS DRAINING. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE AND HAD TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES.     THESE ISSUES ARE HUGE SAFETY HAZARDS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY.",

I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH THROUGH A CURVE ON A FOUR-LANE ROAD.  THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT OF ME OR BEHIND ME, AND NOTHING FOR ME TO HIT OR SIDESWIPE.  THE SIDE DOOR MIRROR SIMPLY \"EXPLODED\". HAD THERE BEEN A PASSENGER SITTING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SEAT WITH THE WINDOW ROLLED-DOWN, I AM CERTAIN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, OR SERIOUSLY INJURED, FROM THE FLYING GLASS AND PLASTIC CASING FROM THE PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR MIRROR AND ITS CASING.  A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET TODAY SHOWED ME THAT THIS IS MORE OF A REOCCURRING PROBLEM THAN PERHAPS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. VERY DANGEROUS, AND SCARY.

THE WIRES ARE BARE AND IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A LOW GRADE FIRE CAUSED FROM WIRES BEING EXPOSED. I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND THAT IT WOULD COST OVER $600 DOLLARS TO REPAIR.  I WAS ALSO ASKED AT THE TIME IF I HAD ANY SMALL RODENT RELATED PETS, I DO NOT. I CALLED SUBARU IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE I WASN'T BUYING THE RODENT STORY.THE DEALERSHIP HAS SINCE CALLED ME BACK TO TELL ME NOW THEY THINK A ROBOTIC ARM MIGHT HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DAMAGED THE WIRES IN PRODUCTION BUT THEY ARE NOT SURE. THE CAR IS NOT REPAIRED AS OF YET, AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR IS \"SAFE\" TO DRIVE. THEY ALSO BROKE A PART ABOVE THE PASSENGER VISOR WHEN CHECKING ALL THIS OUT BECAUSE THE SPACE WAS SO TIGHT , YET A RODENT GOT IN AND OUT AND ONLY DESTROYED THOSE WIRES? THEY REASSURED ME THAT THEY ORDERED THE PART THEY BROKE AND WILL FIX THAT WHEN IT COMES IN. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE \"WIRE PROBLEM\" AND ME NOT APPROVING THE $600 \"RODENT\" REPAIR, MY DOME LIGHTS OVER MY REARVIEW MIRRORS WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE, HOWEVER THEY WERE WORKING BEFORE THEY CHECKED EVERYTHING OUT. I AM WAITING FOR SUBARU TO CALL ME BACK.",

        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A NEW IMPREZA ON 2/4/17, WITHIN DAYS OF BRINGING THE CAR HOME WE NOTICED THAT ALL THE RADIO PRESETS HAD BEEN WIPED OUT, AND THE XM RADIO HAD REVERTED BACK TO A TRIAL PERIOD. THAT SAME DAY WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL SAYING THAT OUR CAR WAS SENDING A PROBLEM CODE FOR THE STARLINK SYSTEM.  UPON CALLING THE DEALERSHIP WE SPOKE WITH A SERVICE ADVISER WHO OWNS THE SAME CAR AND SHE TOLD US THAT SHE HAS ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR SOFTWARE. INCLUDING BACKUP CAMERA, SCREEN FREEZING, LOSING RADIO PRESETS, CLOCK TIME CHANGING.  AND SHE INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A KNOW ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE MODEL AND SHE HAD BEEN DEALING WITH IT FOR 2 MONTHS.  SHE TOLD US THAT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD SUBARU HAD NOT IDEA HOW TO FIX IT AND MAYBE IN MAY THEY MIGHT HAVE IT FIXED.  UPON BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE SALES MANAGER, HE HOLD US THAT SUBARU HAD NOT PUT A STOP SELL ORDER ON THE CALL SO THEY KEPT SELLING THEM.  WE WERE NEVER TOLD ABOUT THIS DEFECT PRIOR TO BUYING THE CAR.  RECENT CALLS WITH SUBARU HAVE CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM, BUT NOBODY WILL CALL US BACK.  WE HAVE PUT 3 MILES ON THE CAR SINCE WE PICKED IT UP. WE WANT TO RETURN THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. WE HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY SUBARU.  THIS WAS A KNOW DEFECT!  SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAVE THE ISSUE.  MY STARLINK SYSTEM WHICH WARNS IF IN AN ACCIDENT, IS SENDING OUT A PROBLEM CODE AND IT MAKES A LOUD NOISE WHEN I TRY TO CONNECT.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE ISSUE.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR.  WE NEED YOUR HELP IN INVESTIGATION THIS. OTHER UNSUSPECTING BUYERS ARE GETTING DUPED EVERY DAY.",
