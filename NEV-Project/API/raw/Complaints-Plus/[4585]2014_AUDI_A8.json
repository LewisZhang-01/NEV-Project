Switching to neutral leads to a very 'leaden'/heavy driving feeling (Kind of like with no Power steering, but a little better).  Able to get it restarted again with some effort. Car will stall out at any point in time when RPM is 1200 or less (you have about .25s to get it back out of that range or it stalls again). Power is sluggish. To avoid stalls, shifts must be rapid and neutral-shift+gas needs to be applied to prevent RPM from being below 1200.  Made it home safely, but had it towed to dealership. Dealership notified me that it was a turbo failure, both impellers have become lodged in the side of turbo casing and are stalled out.  Nothing preceded this; no engine lights or anything. Effect was sudden and drastic. Temperatures were fine. Attempt to drive to repair shop led to total loss of coolant. It is believed this is a seperate issue.",

Exactly like what happened to us. Mechanic says turbo chargers failed. One is sheered off and one is rubbed/failing. Audi quoted us $14,000 to repair. Car is at 80,700 miles which seems to be 700 miles out of warrantee. All service work has been done by Audi and recorded. Audi is unwilling to help with this issue. This has to be the most scary incident driving I have ever had. It was shocking that there was no warning.  And I lost both steering and braking assist while crossing a travel lane and making a turn. It appears that Audi is aware that they have  filter/check valve issues for the turbo charger oil supply. They have since upgraded these parts but have failed to replace the faulty parts when cars like ours go in for service. They have also failed to warn people of this potential hazard. We have called Audi Corporate and they say there is nothing they can do to help.",

HEARD A GURGLING LIKE SOUND. THE EPC LIGHT CAME ON. PULLED VEHICLE OVER TO A SAFE LOCATION AND VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESTART. DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED TURBO'S BLOWN AND ENGINE CONTAINS METAL CAUSING TOTAL ENGINE FAILURE. OUR CONCERN IS IF THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE SEIZED UP WHEN PASSING ANOTHER VEHICLE THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT AN ACCIDENT COULD OCCUR. THERE ARE A FEW TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS CONCERNING THIS TURBO ISSUE, ONE IN FEBRUARY 2017 AND A PRODUCTION SOLUTION TO THE OIL SUPPLY LINES CAME IN MAY 2018.  WHAT ABOUT ALL THE VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE STILL ON THE ROADS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND OWNERS HAVE NO IDEA THIS ISSUE EXISTS? IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE 4.0L ENGINES. TURBO'S. \"AUDIZINE\" WEBSITE DID A FORUM POLL TITLED 4.0TT  BLOWN TURBO POLL. THERE IS ALSO A ISSUE WITH COOLANT LEAKAGE ON THE TURBO'S THAT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE PER TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN MAY 2017.  I AM HOPING FOR A RECALL BEFORE AN INJURY OCCURS.",
