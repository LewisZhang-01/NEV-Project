HYUNDAI MOTOR CORP HAS RECALLED MORE THAN HALF A MILLION VEHICLES FROM MODEL YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2008 DUE TO AN ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE BRAKE LIGHTS TO LIGHT AT INAPPROPRIATE TIMES, OR FAIL TO LIGHT WHEN NEEDED.    IN A DEFECT NOTICE FILED WITH THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, THE AUTOMAKER EXPLAINS, \"THE STOP LAMP SWITCH IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLES MAY MALFUNCTION.  A MALFUNCTIONING STOP LAMP SWITCH MAY CAUSE THE BRAKE LIGHTS NOT TO ILLUMINATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED, OR MAY CAUSE THE BRAKE LIGHTS TO REMAIN ILLUMINATED WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS RELEASED.\" IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT A MALFUNCTIONING STOP LAMP SWITCH COULD \"AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE BRAKE-TRANSMISSION INTERLOCK FEATURE,\" MAKING THE VEHICLE UNABLE TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK.  \"IT MAY ALSO CAUSE THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ESC) MALFUNCTION LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE, AND IT MAY NOT DEACTIVATE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED.\"    HYUNDAI DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE STOP LAMP SWITCH IN ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES, FREE OF CHARGE.  HYUNDAI WILL BEGIN CONTACTING OWNERS THROUGH THE MAIL THIS WEEK.  THOSE WHO WISH TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPAIR ARRANGEMENTS MAY CONTACT HYUNDAI AT 1(800) 633-5151.
