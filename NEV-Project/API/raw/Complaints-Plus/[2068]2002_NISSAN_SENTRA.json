I CAN ERASE THE CODE AND DRIVE IT THEN IT WILL GO INTO FAILSAFE MODE AFTER DRIVING FOR A FEW MINUTES! THE DEALERSHIP TRIED TO TELL ME THE ECU WAS FRIED AND TO BRING IT IN AND EXPECT A MINIMUM CHARGE OF A HOUR FOR THEM TO JUST GET MY CAR IN THERE BUILDING! THAT IS NOT RIGHT! I HAVE 2 RECALLS AND THAT IS ALL I WANT DONE! IF THE ECU WAS TRULY FRIED THEN THE CAR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO START AT ALL! THE CAR ALSO SAT FOR MANY YEARS BUT WAS WELL PROPERLY STORED AND TAKEN CARE OF WHEN IT SAT!",

ON THE SEPT. 26TH, NISSAN USA SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR HALF OF THE EMC'S COST.  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED SHORTLY LATER, SAYING THE TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIR WOULD BE $667.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE EMC FAILED BECAUSE OF THE EMC BOX'S FOAM CURING (A COMMON PROBLEM COVERED BY WARRANTY) OR IT WAS JUST A BUGGY UNIT (A COMMON PROBLEM NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY).

MOTOR CONTINUED TO STOP ON ROAD, LEAVING CAR TO COAST SLOWLY OR BE BRAKED WITHOUT POWER BRAKES FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL VEHICLE WAS SERVICED.   WHEN CAR STOPPED WHILE IDLED AT INTERSECTIONS, IT HAD TO BE PUSHED FROM BEHIND OUT OF THE INTERSECTION WHILE IN NEUTRAL GEAR.    TO SERVICE THE VEHICLE, THE DEALER SERVICE CENTER REPLACED THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR.  THIS WAS THE SAME SENSOR THAT WAS REPLACED UNDER RECALL CAMPAIGN 03V455000 DURING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  SINCE THE REPAIR, THE CAR NO LONGER STALLS AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF NISSAN NORTH AMERICA THAT THE RECALLED PART REPLACEMENT IS NOT UNDER RECALL AND THE BILL FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED.  AS SUCH, THE REPLACED CRANKSHAFT SENSOR APPEARS TO HAVE THE SAME GROUNDS FOR RECALL AS THE ORIGINAL PART THAT WAS RECALLED.    THE DEFECTIVE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR WAS DISCARDED BY THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER SERVICE CENTER AFTER THE REPAIR WAS MADE. *TR",

THE ABOVE RECALL STATES THAT THE PRE-CATALYST COULD OVERHEAT AND DISINTEGRATE, BLOWING PARTICULATE INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER, SCORING THE CYLINDER WALLS, AND CAUSE EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION AND POSSIBLE ENGINE DAMAGE, REQUIRING ENGINE REPLACEMENT. THERE WAS APPROX. 65,000 MILES ON THE CAR AT THIS POINT.    LAST FEBRUARY, I WAS DRIVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY WHEN I SUDDENLY LOST POWER. I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND FOUND THE ENGINE WOULD BARELY RUN AND WOULD NOT REV OVER 2000 RPM. I HAD THIS CAR TOWED 20 MILES TO MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP. UPON INSPECTING THE VEHICLE THEY TOLD ME THAT THE PRE-CATALYST THAT I HAD ALREADY HAD REPLACED ON THE RECALL, HAD DISINTEGRATED, PLUGGING MY EXHAUST, BLOWING CHUNKS OF DEBRIS INTO MY ENGINE, THEREFORE DESTROYING THE ENGINE. I WAS TOLD I'D NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE AT A COST OF $4300.00. THIS CAR ONLY HAD ANOTHER 50,000 MILES ON IT AFTER THE INITIAL RECALL WORK WAS DONE.

THE DIPSTICK BROKE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF STANDARD MAINTENANCE OF THE OIL IN THE CAR AND THE BROKEN DIPSTICK FELL IN, RESULTING IN A  $250-$300 REPAIR (TO RETRIEVE THE DIPSTICK FROM THE ENGINE AND REPLACE THE DIPSTICK). THE DIPSTICK IS CLEARLY DEFECTIVE, AS A BRIEF INTERNET SEARCH REVEALS HUNDREDS OF NISSAN SENTRA OWNER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS EXACT PROBLEM, INCLUDING NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITER (OVER SEVERAL MODEL YEARS). THIS DIPSTICK, WITH ITS FLIMSY PLASTIC PART, IS CLEARLY NOT SUITABLE FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AND CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A DANGEROUS ENGINE FAILURE.       NISSAN IS TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM BY SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE, IN MY CASE, THE DIPSTICK BROKE WHEN IT WAS BEING HANDLED BY AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE STATION, RATHER THAN BY NISSAN SERVICE. THIS RESPONSE IS ABSURD SINCE THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED EPISODE AND SINCE DIPSTICKS ARE MEANT TO BE USED IN GAS STATIONS AND IN CAR OWNERS' OWN GARAGES AND DRIVEWAYS. NOBODY TAKES THEIR CAR BACK TO THE CAR MANUFACTURER TO CHECK THE OIL. THAT IS LIKE SAYING THAT IF THE GAS TANK IS DEFECTIVE, NISSAN WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR BECAUSE GAS WAS PUT IN THE CAR AT A GAS STATION INSTEAD OF AT A NISSAN DEALER. APPARENTLY,  EVEN JIFFY  LUBE HAS HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH NISSAN ON THIS FRONT AS WELL.      IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO PROCEED WITH THE REPAIR IMMEDIATELY AND AT OUR OWN EXPENSE, SINCE THE BROKEN DIPSTICK IN THE ENGINE WAS OBSTRUCTING THE ENTRY OF A NEW DIPSTICK AND ALSO DISTORTING THE MEASUREMENT OF THE OIL.  THUS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF THE CAR NEEDED OIL, AND RUNNING THE CAR WITH INSUFFICIENT OIL WOULD HAVE FURTHER DAMAGED THE ENGINE.  THIS COULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ENGINE FAILURE AND AN ACCIDENT.     WE HAD THE DIPSTICK REPAIR DONE AT A LOCAL NISSAN DEALER AND ARE SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIR (BUT, AS STATED ABOVE, NISSAN HAS REFUSED TO REIMBURSE US).

ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THE ECM REPLACEMENT WOULD BE COVERED IF THERE WAS BURNING OR MELTING OF THE FOAM AROUND ECM.

IF THE ECM'S FAIL DUE TO SULFUR OUT GASSING DURING CURING, HE CANNOT HE SAY FAILURE OF THE ECM WAS NOT DUE TO THE RECALL DUE TO LACK OF BURNING OR MELTING OF THE FOAM. AFTER MUCH DELAY, NISSAN NA FINALLY TOLD ME ABOUT 16 DAYS LATER THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO COVER COST OF ECM REPLACEMENT BECAUSE DEALER SAID THE ECM FAILURE WAS DUE TO AGE AND MILEAGE. THIS IS NOT LOGICAL. I REPLACED ECM. WHEN I TOOK APART MY ECM BOX, I NOTICED THEY ONLY TOOK THE FOAM FROM ABOVE THE ECM AND NOT FOAM BELOW ECM AND VIDEO TAPED. RECALL CALLS FOR TAKING OUT BOTH FOAMS FROM ECM BOX. IT'S OBVIOUS THEY NEVER TOOK OUT ECM TO INSPECT TO SAY \"THERE IS NO BURNING OR MELTING\". THEY FAILED TO PROPERLY PERFORM THE RECALL. I CONTACTED NISSAN NA ABOUT THIS FAILURE, BUT THEY SAID MY CASE WAS CLOSED. JUST TODAY, MY CAR STALLED OUT AGAIN AFTER NEW ECM, AND IT HAD AN ERROR CODE FOR A CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR MALFUNCTION. THEY CLAIM TO HAVE PERFORMED THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR RECALL.  BUT CRANKSHAFT SENSOR IN MY CAR LOOKS AS OLD AS CAR. I BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T PERFORM THAT RECALL AS WELL.

I USED ONLY MOBIL 1 FULL SYN EVERY 5,000 MILES.  THE ENGINE FAILED 3,000 OVER THE STANDARD 60K POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  I FOUGHT WITH NISSAN FOR 1 MONTH WHILE THEY KEPT MY CAR UNTIL I PROVIDED OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS.  ONCE I PROVIDED THEM THEY CHANGED THE COMPLETE ENGINE WHICH TOTALED $8,500 AND MORE THAN THE CAR WAS WORTH ANYMORE.  FURTHER FOR ABOUT 70,000 THE CAR HAD EXTENDED CRANK PROBLEMS AND WERE SEVERE IN HOT OR EXTREME COLD WEATHER.  THE CAR WOULD TAKE 20 SECONDS OR LONGER TO CRANK OVER WHILE PUMPING THE GAS.  AFTER MY 3RD COMPLAINT AT MY 3RD NISSAN DEALER THEY FINALLY FIXED THE PROBLEM AND PUT IN A NEW FUEL PUMP AND SENSOR.  THE CAR HAS 98,000 AND 36,000 MILES AFTER THE NEW ENGINE.

MY EXTENDED WARRANTY (75,000 MILES) HAD JUST RUN OUT AND MY DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT NISSAN CORPORATE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD INTERVENE AND HELP, SINCE ALL OF THE PARTS INVOLVED AND THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM EXACTLY MATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE '03 AND '04S. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THAT MY CAR WAS AN '02. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, NISSAN CORPORATE BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT SINCE THERE WAS NO RECALL ISSUED FOR MY MODEL YEAR AND SINCE MY WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WERE OBLIGATED TO DO FOR ME. THEY ALSO SAID, \"DON'T WORRY. WE ARE CONSTANTLY ASSESSING THE STATUS OF RECALLS AND IF A RECALL IS ISSUED FOR THE 2002 MODEL YEAR, WE WILL REIMBURSE YOU.\" I ENDED UP PAYING OVER $600 (AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE, HAD MY DEALERSHIP NOT TAKEN PITY ON ME AND GIVEN ME A DISCOUNT) TO GET SOMETHING FIXED ON MY CAR THAT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR THE 2 MODEL YEARS FOLLOWING 2002, BUT THAT (FOR SOME REASON) DIDN'T INCLUDE MY CAR. AS I STATED ABOVE, MY DEALERSHIP VERIFIED THAT ALL OF THE PARTS THAT WERE AFFECTED WERE THE SAME AS THOSE INVOLVED IN THE RECALL, AND THAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM WAS THE SAME AS THE RECALL.   *JB",

MARCH 16 2006 MY NISSAN HAD 115754 KMS ON IT WHEN I TOOK IT INTO NISSAN VICTORIA FOR THE RECALLS.  THEY REPLACED THE CRANKSHAFT/CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS (3 IN TOTAL) RECALL R86.  REMOVED ECM CASE HOLDER FOAM R87.  JUNE 20, 2006 I WAS HEADING TO THE HIGHWAY WHEN MY ENGINE STARTED RACING AND JERKING, I DROVE IT HOME.

I RENTED A CAR IN THE MEANTIME TO GET TO WORK.    THE MECHANIC GOT A USED COMPUTER FROM THE AUTO WRECKER AND THE CAR STARTED RIGHT UP.

MAYBE THEY ARE TRYING TO AVOID ANOTHER RECALL LIKE FOR THE SENSORS...TOO LATE...  I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE ECM. I DON'T TRUST THE USED ECM I HAVE IN THE CAR BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT I FEEL THAT NISSAN SHOULD EITHER REBUILD OR GIVE ME A NEW COMPUTER.

IN OCTOBER 2005 MY CAR STALLED UNEXPECTEDLY AND AFTER STARTING IT UP DROVE SO BAD I CANNOT DRIVE CAR ANYMORE. BROUGHT CAR TO DEALER AND WOULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BUT DID TAKE CARE OF ALL RECALLS (I NEVER RECEIVED RECALL INFO-FOUND IT ONLINE MYSELF). MY CAR STILL WAS RUNNING TERRIBLE SO I BROUGHT IT TO MY MECHANIC. A CODE CAME UP FOR THROTTLE SENSOR NOT TO MENTION 5 OTHER CODES. HE REPLACED THROTTLE SENSOR AND NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW CAR RUNS.

NICK, A REGIONAL SPECIALIST SAID NISSAN WILL NOT LOOK AT CAR FREE OF CHARGE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE SPENT OVER $1500 ON THESE PROBLEMS. MY OWN MECHANIC HAS DONE MORE FOR ME THAN A COMPANY WHO SAYS THEY ARE THEIR TOUGHEST CRITIC.  I DECIDED TO LOOK UP INFO ONLINE AND FOUND 5 DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS VERY SIMILAR TO MINE WHERE THE ECM WAS INVOLVED ON THIS WEBSITE. THE COMPANY WHO MANUFACTURED ECM'S TO NISSAN  STATES ON THEIR WEB PAGE THAT ECM'S INSTALLED IN CARS THEY PROVIDED ECM'S TO FROM 1989-2003 HAD A HIGHER RATE OF MALFUNCTION. THIS WEBSITE ALSO EXPLAINED WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOUR ECM FAILS-  1.  WARNING LIGHT REMAINS ON;   2.  NONSENSE FAULT CODES SHOW UP WHEN READER IS CONNECTED;   3.  VEHICLE BREAKDOWN W/O  WARNING;   4.  ERRATIC IDLE, STALL AT TRAFFIC/POOR RUNNING & STARTING PROBLEMS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW BUT HOW INTERESTING THESE ALL ARE HAPPENING TO MY CAR. I BELIEVE 2002 NISSAN SENTRA'S PROBABLY HAVE AN EVEN HIGHER RATE OF FAILURE BECAUSE OF THE RECALL TO THE ECM CASE HOLDER. I BELIEVE THIS MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE ECM.

I ALWAYS ROTATE MY TIRES EVERY 2 OIL CHANGES (~7000 MILES) AND CHECK/INFLATE TIRE PSI EVERY FEW MONTHS. IN JAN 05 I WENT TO ALLIED TIRES FOR AN ALIGNMENT. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR, THEY SHOWED ME LARGE SPLITS/CRACKS ALL AROUND THE INNER SIDEWALL OF ALL 4 TIRES. (AT THIS POINT MY CAR HAD ~28000 MILES) THEY SAID IF I DIDN'T GET THE TIRES REPLACED ASAP, I WOULD HAVE A BLOWOUT. NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I HAD ALL 4 TIRES REPLACED AT SEARS SOON AFTER. (IT WAS EST. 10000 MILES OF TREAD LEFT ON THE \"FAULTY\" TIRES) THE MECHANIC SAID HE ALSO NOTICED THE SPLITTING ON THE \"FAULTY\" TIRES AND HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT EITHER. ON MAY 31, 05, I TOOK THE \"FAULTY\" TIRES (WHICH I STILL HAVE) TO NISSAN. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE SPLITTING, AND SAID TO DEAL W/ FIRESTONE. AT FIRESTONE, THE MECHANIC SAID IT LOOKED LIKE I GOT A BAD BATCH OF TIRES WITH THE CAR, BUT THAT HIS COMMENT WAS \"OFF THE RECORD\" SINCE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BAD MOUTH FIRESTONE. WHEN THE MANAGER CAME OUT, HE BLATANTLY BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SAYING THAT SINCE THE TIRES WEREN'T ON THE CAR, THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH (IE: SINCE THE TIRES WERE OFF, HE THOUGHT I COULD HAVE PURPOSELY DAMAGED THE TIRES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM, EVEN THOUGH I HAD 3 OTHER COMPANIES AS EYE WITNESSES). HE THEN SAID IF I HAD THE TIRES STILL ON THE CAR, HE WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE ME A PRO-RATED REIMBURSEMENT. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE TIRES NEEDED TO BE ON THE CAR FOR THE MANAGER TO NOTICE THE FAULT IN THEM... IN THE END, I WAS OFFERED NO COMPENSATION FOR THESE FAULTY TIRES, BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN MY EYES IS THAT OF SAFETY. I DON'T BELIEVE THESE TIRES ARE SAFE, ESP. CONSIDERING MY EXPERIENCE W/ THEM. FOR TIRES TO \"SPLIT\" AS MINE DID MAKES EVERYDAY DRIVING FOR ME AND OTHERS AROUND ME VERY DANGEROUS. I CAN SEND PICTURES VIA EMAIL IF DESIRED.

IN JUNE, WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, THE DEALER HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT THE CAR WOULD HAVE TROUBLE STARTING WHEN IT RAINS OUT - AND THAT MUST BE THE PROBLEM.

SO, THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP.  BUT TWICE SINCE THE CAR HAS NOT WANTED TO START.    THE CAR HAS, SINCE THE DAY I LEASED IT, RANDOMLY STALLED RIGHT AFTER STARTING.  WHY?  NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW.
