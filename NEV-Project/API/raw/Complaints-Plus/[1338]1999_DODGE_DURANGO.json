THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AT HIGHWAY SPEED WHERE I WAS BARELY ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE HAD THE PCM/ECU REPLACED OVER 5 TIMES, WHICH IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. EXPERTS HAVE PIN POINTED THE ISSUES TO CERTAIN CHIPS COMING UNSOLDERED IN THE PCM/ECU DUE TO HEAT. KEENAN LAWS HAS YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUES ARE, AS WELL AS  MANY OTHER HAVE DONE. DODGE CONTRACT'S OUT THE SOLDERING OF THESE CHIPS, BUT THEY DON'T DO A GOOD JOB AS SOME DON'T WORK AT ALL. FOR EXAMPLE, WE PUT THREE IN BEFORE WE GOT ONE THAT WORKED. THIS IS INEXCUSABLE AND PUTS PEOPLE LIVES AT VERY HIGH RISK. I PAID AROUND $800 TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP IN SANTA ROSA CALIFORNIA FOR A PCM/ECU THAT LASTED ONLY MONTHS. IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRENGTH TO CONTROL THE DURANGO WITH NO POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. DODGE HASN'T BEEN A HELP OR THE PCM/ECU REBUILDERS. CURRENTLY I'M WAITING ON ANOTHER REBUILT PCM/ECU, WHICH THE REBUILDER CAN'T EVEN GIVE A TIME WHEN I COULD GET ONE.

OVER A YEAR PERIOD OF EXPERIMENTING, I HAVE LESSENED BUT NOT CURED THE PROBLEM. ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE RELATED TO INCREASING THE AIRFLOW TO THE CPU/PCM AREA, WHICH CHRONICALLY OVERHEATS DUE TO ITS LOCATION. IF DODGE WOULD RECALL THE 1999 MODEL, I CAN IMAGINE EITHER OF TWO SOLUTIONS AT MINIMAL COST. (PHOTOS OF MY SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.) IF THE AIR GUARD TO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE RADIATOR HAS THE TOP HALF REMOVED, THEN IT IS SIMPLE TO INSTALL AN INTAKE TUBE OR SHAFT TO DIRECT AIR THRU THE GRILLE TO THE PCM. A PLASTIC, EASY INSTALLED UNIT WOULD BE THE LOWEST COST SOLUTION. FAILING THIS, THE RELOCATION OF THE PCM WITH A MOUNTING BRACKET KIT AND A HARNESS EXTENSION WOULD ALLOW PLACEMENT OF THE UNIT IN A COOLER LOCATION (LIKE RIGHT BEHIND THE NEW GRILLE OPENING).

DIPSTICK SHOWED NOTHING. 2 DAYS LATER WHEN I CHECKED THE OIL THE LEVEL WAS GOOD. OIL MUST HAVE GOTTEN TRAPPED IN THE TOP END AND CAUSED THE BOTTOM END TO BE UNLUBRICATED AND FAIL. WHAT A POORLY DESIGNED ENGINE. VEHICLE SITS IN MY BACKYARD WITH ANOTHER BLOWN MOTOR. THANKS CHRYSLER. *TR",

DODGE DEALER ALSO SAID THAT BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT,  UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS WERE BAD AND ALSO  THAT THE HUBS AND WHEEL BEARINGS. WERE BAD, AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR MY SAFETY.  I CALLED DIAMLER CHRYSLER CORP. AND ASKED IF THEY WOULD COVER THIS MFG PROBLEM. I WAS GIVEN CLAM #13756706.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE MY VIN # NOT COVERED BY THE UPPER & LOWER BALL JOINT RECALL.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD NOT BE COVERED, BECAUSE WHEN I LOOKED UP MY 99  DURANGO ON YOUR SITE ON COMPLAINTS, I SAW OVER 500 SIMILAR CASES FOR 99  DURANGO,  WITH BALL JOINT AND STEERING PROBLEMS. DODGE SAID 99 NOT PART OF  RECALL. I THINK THE U.S GOV. NEEDS TO TELL DODGE TO INCLUDE  IN RECALL ALL THE DODGE DURANGO  WITH THIS PROBLEM, PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR THE SAFETY OF THE AMER. PEOPLE AND NOT ALOW CHRYSLER CORP GET AWAY WITH THIS SAFETY PROBLEM. I FEEL THE AMER PEOPLE SHOULD NOT NEED TO GET THE COURTS INVOLVED WHEN WE HAVE AN AGENCY THAT SHOULD PROTECT THE AMER. PEOPLE FROM DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.  I HOPE THIS  BALL JOINT PROBLEM ETC. DOES NOT BECAME ANOTHER \"FORD - FIRESTONE\" SITUATION.

I HAD ALL 4 BALL JOINTS REPLACED AT THE SHOP'S ADVICE, MAINLY BECAUSE HE STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS ENGINEERED WITH UNDERSIZED BALL JOINTS THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO ENDURE THE NORMAL STRESSES OF THAT SIZE AND WEIGHT VEHICLE. I WAS TOLD THAT THE RIGHT FRONT UPPER BALL JOINT WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF FAILURE. AT THE TIME THE VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 70,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE WORKED ON CARS SINCE A TEEN AND HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A FAILURE EVEN ON VEHICLES WITH WELL OVER 100,000 MILES.IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THIS THAT I STARTED HEARING OF PROBLEMS WITH THE DURANGO AND DAKOTA BALL JOINTS.

HE OFFERED TO REPLACE THE UPPER AND LOWER CONTROL ARMS (THE COME WITH THE BALL JOINTS INSTALLED) AT A COST OF OVER $2300.  SINCE THE DEALER SAID THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE (RIGHT UPPER BALL JOINT WAS CLOSE TO FAILING), THE EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY PAID FOR THE WORK.  MY COST WAS, FORTUNATELY FOR ME, ONLY $25.

THERE IS NO REASON WHY THESE BALL JOINTS SHOULD FAIL SO SOON.   ALL YEARS OF THE 1ST GENERATION DURANGO (1998-2003) SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT RECALL.  THE CONTROL ARMS AND BALL JOINTS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME FOR ALL YEARS, SO ALL SUFFER FROM THE SAME POOR DESIGN.  HIS VISIT (THE ONE IN WHICH THE CONTROL ARMS WERE FINALLY REPLACED) WAS THE 3RD TIME I HAD COMPLAINED (TWO TIMES AT A DEALERSHIP THAT HAS JUST GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEN THIS TIME AT THIS OTHER DEALERSHIP) ABOUT THE BALL JOINTS.  I FIRST ASKED FOR THEM TO BE CHECKED OUT WHEN THE 60 MINUTES STORY CAME OUT ABOUT THE BALL JOINTS (OCT. 2003).  THEN I ASKED AGAIN EARLIER THIS YEAR.  THIS DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE FINE BOTH TIMES.  JUST AFTER THIS SECOND VISITI TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FIRESTONE FOR AN ALIGNMENT, THEY SAID THAT THE COULDN'T ALIGN THE FRONT END PROPERLY BECAUSE THE BALL JOINTS WERE WORN.  WHEN I CONFRONTED THE DEALERSHIP A COUPLE DAYS LATER, THEY SAID THE FIRESTONE PERSON DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THAT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, AND ON NO OCCASION WAS I DRIVING IN AN \"AGGRESSIVE\" MANNER OR \"HARD' BRAKING. NOR WAS MY PREVIOUS COMPLAINT TO NHTSA A \"PARROTING\" OF SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM FROM THE IMPREZA WEBSITE, AS SUBARU HAS ACCUSED. THE ABS IS OVERLY SENSITIVE TO BUMPY SURFACES AND IS A SAFETY RISK, PERIOD.    MY EMAIL TO SUBARU OF AMERICA:    I HAVE JUST REVIEWED SOA'S LETTER DATED 9/10/04 TO NHTSA RE YOUR INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED ABS PROBLEMS IN WRX'S. I AM DISMAYED BY SOA'S INABILITY TO DOCUMENT, AND REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE, THE ABS PROBLEM. I AM INSULTED THAT SUBARU BLAMES THE PROBLEM ON \"AGGRESSIVE DRIVING PATTERNS.\" THE PROBLEM REGULARLY OCCURS AT ONE POINT IN MY DAILY URBAN COMMUTE WHEN I BRAKE FOR A TRAFFIC LIGHT OVER A BUMPY SURFACE. I AM USING ONLY 15% OF THE BRAKING CAPABILITY AT 20 MPH WHEN THE ABS FAULT OCCURS-- HARDLY \"AGGRESSIVE\" OR \"HARD\" BRAKING, AND HARDLY A SITUATION THAT ONLY AGGRESSIVE PERFORMANCE DRIVERS WOULD ENCOUNTER. WHEN IT OCCURS, THERE IS A SUDDEN, DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN DECELERATION. DECELERATION IS NO LONGER PROPORTIONAL TO PEDAL PRESSURE, AND INCREASED PRESSURE IS INEFFECTIVE WHILE THE ABS IS \"CONFUSED\" BY THE BUMPY SURFACE. SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE HAD SCARY MOMENTS WHEN THE DROP IN DECELERATION HAS RESULTED IN NEARLY REAR-ENDING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. I AM VERY PUZZLED WHY AN EVENT, THAT FOR ME IS SO PREDICTABLE AND REPEATABLE, HAS ESCAPED YOUR ANALYSIS.      I FURTHER TAKE OFFENSE TO THE CLAIM IN YOUR LETTER THAT MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTSA WERE DISHONEST REPETITIONS OF PROBLEMS A FEW HAD DESCRIBED ON AN OWNERS  WEBSITE. NICE TRY, BUT I CAN ATTEST TO THE VALIDITY OF THE PROBLEM IN MY CAR, HAVING EXPERIENCED IT DOZENS OF TIMES. DISCUSSION ON THE WEBSITE HAS INFORMED OWNERS OF THE PROBLEM AND MAY HAVE PREVENTED SOME ACCIDENTS, SOMETHING I CANNOT SAY FOR SUBARU!    CHARLES F. VISSER.  *AK",

I WAS UNABLE TO PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING. I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN WHEN I WENT FROM BRIGHT TO DIM ONCE BEFORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLUKE, THIS LAST TIME WAS SCARY. I HAD BOTH CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 30, 2004. THIS IS DEFINATELY A HAZARD AND COULD CERTAINLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. MY HUSBAND WORKS 35 MILES FROM HOME AND WHILE GETTING ONTO ANOTHER MAJOR HIGHWAY HE HAD THE FRONT BEARING FREEZE AND THE CV JOINT BREAK.

I HAD DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE JUST 1 WEEK PRIOR TO THIS HAPPENING AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING THAT THIS MIGHT OCCUR. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD SOME NOISE. THE WHOLE UNDERSIDE OF THE DURANGO WAS COVERED IN GREASE FROM THE BEARING. THIS TO ME MEANS THAT IT HAD BEEN MAINTAINED AND THIS WAS A FAULTY PIECE OF METAL.

IT HAD GUNK IN IT AND TOLD ME THAT THE MANIFOLD GASKET AND/OR PLENUM GASKET HAD FAILED AND THE OIL LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MIXED WITH ANTIFREEZE.  I THEN HAD CHECKED TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS OF THIS KIND.  I WAS SUPPRESSED TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS 30 TO 40 SIMILAR COMPLAINTS LIKE MINE ON YOUR WEBSITE ALONE WHERE THE ENGINE HAD FAILED WITH THE OIL GUNKING UP.

THIS VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SERVICED AT THE LOCAL DODGE DEALERSHIP IN LITTLE ROCK AT THE SERVICE INTERVALS THAT CHRYSLER RECOMMENDS IN THEIR SERVICE MANUAL.  I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY DURANGO AT 51,492 MILES WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMING ON.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE.   THE SERVICE DEPT. TOLD ME THAT THE VEHICLE'S COMPUTER SAID I HAD A BLOWN HEAD GASKET ALONG WITH #7 INJECTOR BEING BAD.  SO A NEW PLATINUM GASKET, #7 INJECTOR AND INJECTOR SERVICE WAS DONE AT A COST TO ME OF $814.72.  AT 52,085 MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.   AGAIN INTO THE DODGE SERVICE DEPT. ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT NOW THE ENGINE COMPUTER IS BAD (PCM213) AND WILL BE REPLACED UNDER DODGE'S 80,000 MILE WARRANTY.   MY THINKING AT THIS POINT WAS THAT IF THE COMPUTER WAS GIVING OUT FALSE INFORMATION AT 51,492 MILES THEN PERHAPS MY $814.72 BILL FOR A NEW PLATINUM GASKET WASN'T JUSTIFIED.   OF COURSE, THE SERVICE DEPT. ASSURED ME THAT THESE REPAIRS WERE INDEED NECESSARY AT THE TIME.  AT 53,628 MILES I GREW CONCERNED ABOUT UPPER/LOWER BALL JOINTS BEING BAD ON MY DURANGO AFTER WATCHING A CBS NEWS REPORT.  AS I WAS PLANNING A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP FOR THE HOLIDAYS, I HAD THE SERVICE DEPT. EVALUATE THE BALLS JOINTS BEFORE I LEFT, AND SURE ENOUGH, MY DURANGO NEEDED UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS AND A RIGHT TIE ROD.   BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SO DANGEROUS I WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO TAKE ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION ON MY TRIP.   NEW PARTS WERE ORDERED AND THE DODGE SERVICE DEPT. REPLACED THE UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON BOTH SIDES AND A RIGHT TIE ROD ARM AT A COST TO ME OF $952.10 PLUS A $57.82 DIAGNOSTIC TEST TO TELL US THESE PARTS WERE BAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.  I FEEL THAT MY VEHICLE IS UNRELIABLE AND NOT ONE THAT I CAN DEPEND ON IN THE FUTURE.   THESE ARE SAFETY DEFECTS THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD HAVE FIXED AT NO COST TO ME.   I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPAIR THIS VEHICLE ANYMORE.      *LA",

I WAS EXTREMELY SHOCKED TO HEAR THIS.  AT LESS THAN 38000 MILES, THIS SUV SHOULD NOT BE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH SUCH A MAJOR SUSPENSION COMPONENT.   I ASKED THE TECHNICIAN TO SHOW ME WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND HE PROCEEDED TO SHOW ME THE AMOUNT OF PLAY IN MY FRONT SUSPENSION DUE TO THIS FAULTY COMPONENT.  WHEN I INQUIRED AS TO WHY THERE WAS NO GREASE FITTING ON MUCH OF THE FRONT END, HE REPLIED \"THATS THE WAY DODGE DESIGNS EM\" AND LEFT IT AT THAT.  I OPTED TO PERFORM THE WORK MYSELF SO AS TO SAVE THE OUTRAGEOUS LABOR CHARGES HERE IN CALIFORNIA, AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT A HIGHER QUALITY PART WAS INSTALLED THAT INCLUDED GREASE FITTINGS.  SHORTLY AFTER I COMPLETED THE REPAIRS, I BEGAN SEARCHING THE INTERNET FOR SIMILAR EXPERIENCES FROM OTHER DURANGO OWNERS.  ALSO TO MY SURPRISE, I FOUND A SUSTANTIAL NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FRONT SUSPENSION ON THIS SUV, AND ALSO FOR MODELS OF OTHER YEARS.  ANY AUTO MANUFACTURER WHO INSTALLS NON GREASABLE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS ON AN SUV DESIGNED TO GO OFFROAD IS SIMPLY ENGAGING IN COST CUTTING MEASURES AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS LIVES.  I BELIEVE THAT MY WIFE,FAMILY AND I WERE LUCKY THAT THIS ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED EARLY AND THERE WERE NO ACCIDENTS OR FATALITIES.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS.  ADDITIONALLY, I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY A TECHNICIAN WOULD EVEN INSPECT THE FRONT END ON A VEHICLE THAT WAS BROUGHT IN FOR A SIMPLE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM.  UNLESS THE TECHNICIAN EXPECTED THE DAMAGE AND NOTING THE MILAGE ON THE TRUCK, SIMPLY INSPECTED THE COMPONENTS ON HIS OWN, I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD OCCUR OTHERWISE.*AK",

SO, I TOOK IT INTO ANDERSON DODGE FOR A SECOND OPINION AND THEY SAID THEY WERE FINE (GOOD) ACTUALLY.  SO, I CHECKED DEFECTS OFF THE NHSTA WEBSITE AND SAW SEVERAL INSTANCES OF BALL JOINTS FAILING AT EVERY 30,000 MILES.  SO, I CALLED A DODGE PARTS DEPARTMENT AND ASKED WHAT THE PART #S WERE FOR BALL JOINTS AND CONTROL ARMS FOR A '99 DURANGO AND FOR A '99 DAKOTA (4X4) AND GUESS WHAT THEY ARE THE SAME NUMBERS?????  LET ME GUESS, DESIGN THE 4X4 DAKOTA AND JUST ADD ALL THAT WEIGHT AND MOMENT ARMS OF THE BACK OF THE SUV TOP AND LIFT GATE AND NOT EXPECT THE EQUATIONS TO CHANGE FOR WEAR AND TEAR OF THE FRONT SUSPENSION??????  AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE SUSPENSION WAS MODIFIED IN THE 2000 MODEL YEAR.  WHAT A SURPRISE???  I WONDER IF NHSTA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MY FINDINGS??????  NOW I AM GOING TO A THIRD DODGE DEALER FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION TO SEE IF I REALLY DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALL JOINTS AND CONTROL ARMS.  IF THESE BALL JOINTS I HAVE NOW ARE OK, I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN TAP THEM AND PUT IN A GREASE FITTING IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THEM.  IF HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT OK, I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA AND SHOW THEM MY FINDINGS.  I BELIEVE A DESIGN FLAW SHOULD BE A RECALL.   *NLM",

THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL MAKING A RATTLING NOISE BETWEEN 20-30 MPH. THEY FIRST TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG IT WAS TIRE NOISE. THEN I BROUGHT IT BACK A WEEK LATER AND THEY REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. WHEN IT WAS STILL DOING IT A WEEK LATER, I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALER AND THE STEERING COLUMN WAS FOUND TO BE BENT AND REPLACED. NOT LONG AFTER THAT I HAD TROUBLE WITH THE ENGINE, WHEN I WOULD STOP, THE ENGINE WOULD IDLE DOWN AND ALMOST STALL. I STOPPED AT A GAS STATION AND FOUND I HAD NO OIL. I PUT IN TWO QUARTS AND CALLED THE DEALER. THEY FOUND THE PLENUM GASKET HAD A LEAK.  I HAD THAT REPLACED FOR OVER $450. SHORTLY AFTER THAT I WAS TRAVELING HOME ON THE HIGHWAY AND IT HESITATED AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTICS TEST AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I NOTICE THAT THE RPM'S HAD STARTED REVVING UP AND DOWN WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING RIGHT AFTER THIS HAPPEN. I CALLED AND QUESTIONED ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO CHANGE THE OIL. IT STILL DID IT AFTER AN OIL CHANGE.  WHILE ON OUR WAY HOME TO NY, WE HAD STOPPED AND IT STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. WHEN WE GOT HOME I TOOK IT IN AND HAD ANOTHER  TEST DONE ON IT. THEY REPLACED THE OUTPUT SPEED SENSOR AND SAID THAT WAS GOING TO FIX IT.  IT STILL DID THE RPM THING AFTER THAT, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANOTHER DIAGNOSTICS TEST. I HAVE SINCE, GOTTEN A TUNE UP AND OIL CHANGE, AND IT STILL DOES IT.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON AND GOING OFF. I AM SORRY THAT THIS IS SO LONG, BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND NO ONE WILL HELP. MY QUESTIONS ARE, HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE, ARE THERE ANY RELATED RECALLS, AND IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP GET THIS RESOLVED?

SOME REPORTS STATE THEY EVEN THREW THEIR RODS WHEN IT HAPPENED.  OTHERS HAVE HAD BEARING WEAR.  WE WERE ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN OUR OIL PRESSURE SUDDENLY DROPPED TO ZERO WHEN THIS HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME.  WE HAD TO STOP AND CONTINUE PUTTING OIL IN THE ENGINE ABOUT EVERY 100 MILES SO WE COULD MAKE IT HOME FROM VACTATION.  IT'S LIKE THE OIL WAS DISAPPEARING, BUT THERE WAS NO VISIBLE LEAK.  NO LEAK IN OUR DRIVEWAY WHEN WE GOT HOME EITHER.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE OIL PUMP AFTER WE GOT HOME IN OCTOBER. THREE WEEKS LATER THE OIL PRESSURE WOULD START AT ZERO WHEN I INITIALLY TURNED ON THE CAR IN THE MORNING, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD DING, AND THEN THE OIL PRESSURE WOULD GO UP TO NORMAL.

THE OIL PUMP AND OIL PICK UP TUBE WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTEE, BUT NOT THE LONG BLOCK.  IT IS DISTRESSING THAT THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT WARRANT THE REPAIR EVEN WITH MAINTENANCE RECORDS.  I HAVE FOUND AN ARTICLE IN A SYNDICATED NEWSPAPER COLUMN WHICH INDICATES THAT CHRYSLER IS AT FAULT FOR HAVING A MAINTEANCE SCHEDULE OF 7.5K MILES IN THE OWNERS MANUAL, THE ARTICLE ALSO MENTIONS A POSSIBLE VENTILATION DESIGN FLAW WHICH CAUSES CONDENSATION AND SLUDGE TO BUILD UP.

I STEPPED ON THE PARKING BRAKE, PLACED THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.  THIS FINALLY STOPPED THE CAR.  TOWED THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC COULDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  2 WEEKS AGO THIS HAPPENED AGAIN,  IT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE DEALERS AND THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING. THEY INSTALLED A CO-PILOT TO PICK UP THE ERROR CODES THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS.  BASICALLY A BLACK BOX.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.  I WAS LUCKY I DIDN'T GET INTO 2 ACCIDENTS, THOUGH I CAME REALLY CLOSE.  MY CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I WANT THEM TO REALLY DIAGNOSE EVERY PART OF THIS CAR.  THEY STILL CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG THEY WANTED ME TO PICK IT UP, KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  THIS IS NOT DRIVER ERROR.  I REGULARLY MAINTAIN MY CAR. THIS IS A DEFECT, AND PLACES EVERYONE IN HARMS WAY.  CAR RACING UNCONTROLLABLY AND UNABLE TO STOP THE ACCELERATION WITH THE BRAKES THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM.  *AK",

THEY SAID THE FUEL TANK IS ON BACKORDER NATIONWIDE, AND THAT THERE ARE 20 OTHER DURANGO OWNERS WAITING ON THIS PART.  I FEEL THIS NECESSITATES A RECALL OF THIS MODEL BECAUSE A)  THE LIKLIHOOD OF COMBUSTION IS VERY POSSIBLE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE FUEL TANK ACTUALLY SHRINKS UP MUCH LIKE A  PAPER BAG  WHEN ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT; B)  THIS HAS HAPPENED ON NUMEROUS VEHICLES ALREADY, ENOUGH TO REQUIRE DODGE TO BE IN A BACKORDER SITUATION.  I ALSO AM WITHOUT A VEHICLE COMPARABLE TO MY DURANGO THAT SEATS 8.  THE DEALER ONLY PROVIDES A $30 A DAY RATE WITH ENTERPRISE, WHICH SUPPLIED ME WITH A FORD PICK-UP THAT SEATS 3.

I FILED AN INVESTIGATION WITH CHRYSLER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD BE OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE VEHICLE WITHIN THREE DAYS.  UNTIL THAT TIME, THE BODY SHOP WAS NOT TO TOUCH THE VEHICLE.  AFTER ONE WEEK, THE BODY SHOP INFORMED ME THAT THE INVESTIGATOR NEVER SHOWED.  WHEN I PHONED CHRYSLER THEY INFORMED ME THAT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON MY REPORT HAD NOT BEEN FORWARDED TO THE INVESTIGATOR.  THEY AGAIN GAVE ME A THREE DAY TIME FRAME.  IT WAS THREE WEEKS BEFORE CHRYSLER'S INVESTIGATOR GAVE US THE OKAY TO START REPAIRS ON THE VEHICLE.  IN THE MEANTIME, I WAS INCURRING RENTAL CAR EXPENSES WHICH CHRYSLER TOLD ME I COULD BE REIMBURSED FOR IF THEY WERE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE.  I WAS NEVER ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY REPORT INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE AS I WAS TOLD IT HAD BEEN MAILED TO ME. TEN DAYS LATER,I RECIEVED A ONE-PAGE FORM LETTER STATING THAT THERE WAS NO MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND NO COMPENSATION WOULD BE MADE.  I WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER ANY OF THE EXTRA RENTAL CAR CHARGES THAT I PAID DUE TO THEIR DELAY.  I CALLED CHRYSLER TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE REPORT AND WAS TOLD TO CALL THE INVESTIGATOR DIRECTLY.  THE INVESTIGATOR TOLD ME THAT THE REPORT WAS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND COULD NOT BE RELEASED.  HE THEN WENT ON TO SAY THAT I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY THAT THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE THE INJURY I RECIEVED FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL WAS PROBABLY LESS THAT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED FROM THE AIRBAG.

THEY PUT A DYE IN THE ANTIFREEZE TO BE ABLE TO DETECT A LEAK USING A BLACKLIGHT AT A LATER DATE. I HAVE GOTTEN ON INTERNET NEWSGROUP WEB SITES AND HAVE FOUND OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR PROBLEMS, SOME WORSE THAN OTHERS.

HE INDICATED HE WAS THINKING ABOUT BUYING A DURANGO BUT NOT ANYMORE.  EVIDENTLY A 3-4 INCH BOLT HAD COME LOOSE FROM THE STEERING COLUMN SOMEWHERE UNDER THE DASHBOARD AND THIS IS THE ONLY THING LINKING THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE FRONT WHEELS.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, THIS REPRESENTS A FATAL DESIGN FLAW IN THE DURANGO, AND THERE SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE RECALL.  MY SON AND I ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ALIVE.  HAVING WORKED FOR FORD FOR 10 YEARS, I'M SURE CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT, BUT HAS ESTIMATED THEY WILL PAY OUT LESS IN WRONGFUL DEATH SUITS THAN THE COST OF A RECALL.
