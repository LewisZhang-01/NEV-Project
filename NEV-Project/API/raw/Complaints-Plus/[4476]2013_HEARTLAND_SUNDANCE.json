DROVE TO QUALIFIED TIRE STORE AND EXPECTED TO HAVE THAT TIRE REPLACED, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST TIRE REPLACED, THE REMAINING 3 TIRES WERE ALL SEPARATING AND VERY CLOSE TO BLOWING OUT.  HAVE GONE ON OUR OWNERS FORUM AND READ ABOUT SO MANY OTHER RV OWNERS HAVING DANGEROUS ISSUES WITH THIS BRAND.  HAVE CONTACTED THE RV MANUFACTURER AND THEY SEEM TO THINK GETTING 7000 MILES ON A TIRE IS GOOD.  REALLY???  WE WANTED THEM TO AT LEAST GIVE US A FEW DOLLARS BACK ON THESE TIRES SINCE WE WANTED TO BE SAFE AND UPGRADED TO A TIRE THAT CAN HANDLE THE WEIGHT OF OUR RV.  BY THE WAY, WE HAD OUR TRAILER AND TRUCK PROFESSIONALLY WEIGHED AT A RALLY HOSTED BY OUR RV MANUFACTURER AND WERE TOLD WE WERE UNDERWEIGHT!!!  WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU INVESTIGATE THESE TIRES AND PERHAPS READ THE OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER OWNERS.  IT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION PUTTING INADEQUATE TIRES ON AN RV.   *TR",
