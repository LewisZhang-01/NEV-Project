I am still having this issue 5 years later and have purchased sometimes 2 batteries a year depending! The windshield also cracked within the first year I bought the car. I had it fixed and it cracked again this time not under warranty and the crack is in front of my eyesight sensor which makes my eyesight turn off which is very dangerous. I have seen MANY complaints on the windshield issue online with 2021 foresters. This is unacceptable. I am very unsatisfied with the company for not fixing this issue or making it right. I would not buy another Subaru or recommend anyone to buy one until they fix these problems.",

I don't know how but I was able to wrestle car back into r/h lane and off hwy.  It was towed to a repair shop where the alignment was severely off. They also found evidence that the r front brake had locked. They replaced calipers and realigned wheels.  Within 20 miles after repairs the steering again became very stiff. I had the car towed to my mechanic who found \"numerous\" codes indicating failure of steering control module and rack and pinion assy.  Since that time it has been realigned three times but I still feel the steering is erratic with vibration of both the steering cheel and chassis.  After 2 attempts, a Subaru service shop seems to have eliminated the steering wheel vibration by dismounting the damaged front tires and switching the damaged outer treads onto the inside. This has now made the car feel like it wobbles under 20mph and over 55mph. They have pronounced the car safe to drive, despite my concern for the way the car feels while driving.",

In early Oct 2021, my car sat idle for 10 days in the airport parking garage at JFK Int'l airport in NYC while I was away.  When I returned home, the battery was dead, again stranding my approximately 50 miles from my home.  I had to get a jump from a tow company who found that the red terminal on the battery was completely corroded.  He advised that I would need to get a new battery when I returned home.  I brought the car to Subaru the next day & was told by a tech in the service department that the battery was fine & was at 100% capacity but that the issue was a defective cable connected to the battery which they replaced. I had occasion to bring my Forester to Subaru for service yesterday (11/8/2021) and had the battery checked.  This time a more thorough check was done & although the battery again tested at 100%, when it was checked for its capacity from a \"cold start\", it tested as weak.

The collision is what stopped the car. My Subaru Forester is very damaged (bumper, lights, and frame rail) and the car in front also had extensive damage. My safety and the safety of the neigbhorhood cars, pedestrians and homes was at risk given my car was unstoppable despite braking.  I couldn't understand what happened so I did an internet search for acceleration while braking and many articles came up reguarding several Subaru models (including mine) of  \"sudden unintended acceleration\" issues. What was described was exactly what I experienced. There are several class action lawsuits in the works as Subaru has not taken any responsibility.  No dashboard warning lights came on before or after the crash. I took the car to the Subaru dealer I purshased it from. At first they said there would be a 250. dollar diagnostic fee. When I picked it up they said there was an ECM (Engine Control Module) update and they performed it on my car. The update was designed \"to address problems\" like those I described. The clerk would not elaborate, was very vague and would say nothing beyond that except he didn't know if the update would fix the problem-that we would just have to wait and see. I explained that if it happened again it could have catastrophic consequences, he had nothing to say. He waived the service fee. I got the impression Subaru didn't want to say much because they would be responsible. By waiving the fee they hoped I would just go away.  I am left with: a severely damaged car, as is my neighbor's, an accident that looks to be my fault-when in fact it is Subaru's fault, a large deductable to pay, a point on my lisence and increased insurance rates, and a car I have no faith in.

The safety issue is one of personal safety -- that we can't depend on the car, so we hesitate to use it. We don't want to be stranded somewhere unexpectedly because the battery suddenly dies, especially after dark. Our Subaru dealership ran diagnostic tests today (August 23, 2021) and claimed there is no problem, that the draw on the battery is within acceptable parameters. They will continue to test it tomorrow, but from conversations with the tech manager today, I feel certain they will claim there is no problem. The solution the technician suggested is that we drive the car more frequently. But our use of the car has been consistent since we first leased it. There must be a reason that the battery was fine for 48 months and now suddenly loses power unexpectedly and repeatedly. We understand from internet research we did today that this kind of battery problem is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit here in New Jersey against Subaru for several of their models from the years 2015-present. We think Subaru ought to be more forthright about the issue and do what's right for their customers. Please help us.",

The problem with the battery began within the first year of purchase and has continued two times afterwards replacing the battery now 3 times Below I put the last time this happened.  I've been stranded numerous times and I shouldn't have to keep jump starting my car.  I've brought this concern to the Dealer (Sunset Subaru, Sarasota) and it is not taken seriously.  In my opinion, this has been and continues to be a technical problem going back to the purchase of the vehicle in question.",

At other times it takes more rotations of the steering wheel to make the turn than it does to come out of the turn, 3) Constant adjustments to steering have to be made in order to stay in a lane regardless of whether the lane is straight or curved. It's like trying to maneuver a boat on water or like driving on a frictionless surface. It feels like the car switches to a different control system, either void of any driver control, or delayed response to driver input, and 4) The steering wheel has to be turned to almost a 90 degree angle before it engages the wheels while the car is running and stationary.  With the exception of item 4, the steering problems occur when there are other cars in the vicinity of our car. On secluded roads our car drives fine, so far. The steering issues occur during city and highway driving. The steering problems occur even when the following car assistive technologies are all set to off: automatic braking, hill assist, lane change assist, X-mode, Eyesight, and cruise control.  On May 4, 2021, we took the car to the Subaru Superstore of Chandler in Arizona. We showed the dealership a video of item 4 and they observed it. They described it as \"egregious\". The dealership stated that they could not find a reason for item 4 and they could not duplicate the other problems. They stated that they documented the problem.  Having an unresponsive/delayed response steering system could prove disastrous when seconds count to avert a disaster.

MY CHOICES WERE TO RETURN HOME OR LEAVE MY CAR IN THE PARKING LOT WITH THE KEY IN IT WHILE DRAINING THE BATTERY  WHILE THIS MAY SEEM MORE AN INCONVENIENCE THAN A SAFETY ISSUE, ON SOME OCCASIONS THIS RESULTED IN MY BATTERY BECOMING SO WEAK THAT MY CAR WOULDN'T CRANK LEAVING ME STRANDED UNTIL I COULD FIND SOMEONE TO HELP ME JUMP OFF MY CAR.

I HAD TO CALL FOR ROADSIDE SERVICE. THEY CAME AND GAVE ME A JUMP. THE VEHICLE STARTED WITH NO PROBLEM. I DID AS THE SERVICE PERSON TOLD ME TO LET THE VEHICLE RUN FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES SO THE CELLS CAN BUILD UP IN THE BATTERY, SO I DID AS I WAS TOLD. AS I WOULD TURN THE CORNERS ON THE STREETS-THE STEERING BECAME VERY DIFFICULT, (IN BOTH DIRECTIONS). ESPECIALLY AFTER TURNING AT A STOP SIGN, SO AS I WERE DRIVING I NOTICE THE DASH BOARD WOULD KEEP BLINKING. I TOOK A PHOTO OF THE GAGES ON THE DASHBOARD. THE EYESIGHT LIGHT STAYED, BUT THE OTHERS KEPT BLINKING OFF AND ON. I DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME AND TRIED TO PARALLEL PARK IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE BUT THE WHEELS WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO DO SO. SO I PARKED THE CAR ACROSS THE STREET WHERE THEIR WERE A LOT MORE SPACE AND I PARKED THERE. I SET THERE FOR ANOTHER 30 MINUTE BEFORE TURNING OFF THE ENGINE. ONCE I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF  AND TRIED TO START THE ENGINE AGAIN IT FELL TO TURN OVER. NO SOUND OR ANYTHING JUST LIKE EARLIER. IN 2018 THEY REPLACE MY BATTERY, BECAUSE I WAS HAVING TO CALL FOR ROADSIDE SERVICE UP TO 3-4 TIMES A WEEK BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD DIE OUT ON ME. ALL THIS TOOK PLACE IN A PERIOD OF 3-4 MONTHS. NOW THIS BATTERY IS APPROXIMATELY 10-12 MONTHS OLD. WHEN I TOOK IT IN FOR THE NEW BATTERY, I WAS TOLD THE BATTERY WAS TO SMALL FOR THE CAR. SO NOW I AM STUCK AT HOME WITHOUT A VEHICLE UNTIL THE SUBARU SHOP OPENS ON MONDAY AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN FIX THE PROBLEM. I'VE NEVER HAD A 2 YEAR OLD VEHICLE THAT'S GIVEN ME THIS MANY PROBLEMS.",

OCT. 3, 2018 WE TOOK CAR TO TUCSON SUBARU BECAUSE CAR WAS BRAKING WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED, AND THERE WAS A DIAGNOSTIC CODE IN THE POWER-TRAIN SYSTEM. DEALER KEPT CAR AND RETURNED IT TO US OCT. 4, 2018 STATING THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THE BRAKE PROBLEM INCREASED AFTER RECEIVNG OUR CAR BACK. THE FOLLOWING ANOMALOUS VEHICLE BEHAVIOR BEGAN TO OCCUR, INTERMITTENTLY AND NOW DAILY. 1)CAR ACCELERATES ON ITS OWN AND WHEN BRAKE IS LIGHTLY PRESSED. 2) WHEN TURNING, CAR STOPS MOMENTARILY AND AT OTHER TIMES ACCELERATES INTO THE TURN FROM THE REAR WHEELS CAUSING THE CAR TO ALMOST FISHTAIL. 3)CAR SELF ACCELERATES FROM THE REAR LIKE IT'S BEING PUSHED. 4)CAR BRAKES WHEN NO BRAKES ARE APPLIED, AND WHEN GAS PEDAL IS LIGHTLY PRESSED. 5)SPEED DOES NOT REGISTER CORRECTLY ON SPEEDOMETER WHEN CAR SELF ACCELERATES AND SELF BRAKES. 6)WHEELS LOSE TRACTION AT RANDOM TIMES MAKING IT LIKE DRIVING A BOAT ON WATER. IT FEELS LIKE ALL MANUAL CONTROLS DISENGAGE. 7)DURING ANOMALIES, SOMETHING IN CAR CAUSES DIFFICULTY IN CONCENTRATION TO NEAR PASSING OUT. EXITING CAR DECREASES SYMPTOMS. 8)SOMETHING AT FRONT FLOOR IN CAR CAUSES FEET TO HEAT UP, VIBRATE, GO NUMB, SWELL, AND FORM SMALL BLOOD CLOTS BENEATH THE SKIN SURFACE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO HOLD ON THE BRAKE OR GAS. 9)THE ANOMALIES OCCUR WHEN A CAR TAILS US OR STAYS A SPECIFIC DISTANCE BEHIND OUR CAR. ALL ANOMALIES HAVE OCCURRED WHEN THERE ARE OTHER CARS IN THE VICINITY OF OUR CAR, DURING CITY AND HIGHWAY DRIVING (CRUISE CONTROL IS OFF). NOV. 17, 2018 AND APR. 23, 2019, WE TOOK THE CAR TO TUCSON SUBARU. DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THESE ANOMALIES.",

I FIND MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE ONLINE BUT NO RECALLS. WHY NOT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL NEED TO BE KILLED BEFORE THIS SAFETY ISSUE IS QUICKLY RESOLVED? THIS VEHICLE HAS 25,437 MILE ON IT.",

THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IS NEVER WET WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS. MOST RECENTLY, TODAY, JUNE 10TH 2018 THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG DISABLED LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING IN DRY CONDITIONS AND NO BEVERAGE OR MOISTURE OF ANY KIND WAS IN THE CAR. THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE. AFTER I PARK THE CAR, TURN IT OFF, HAVE THE PASSENGER EXIT THE VEHICLE AND GET BACK IN THE SYSTEM IS FINE AGAIN. I FIND IT INCREDULOUS THAT I HAVE A 16 MONTH OLD CAR THAT THIS HAPPENS REPEATEDLY IN. I HAVE MADE THE DEALER AWARE TWICE AND THEY SIMPLY LIST MY SUBARU MAINTENANCE RECORDS AS ROUTINE AND NEVER SHOW THE DETAILED REASON MY CAR WAS TAKEN IN. I AM AFRAID THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE SYSTEM WILL STAY DISABLED AND I WILL HAVE TO HAVE MY WIFE RIDE IN THE BACK SEAT. THE PROBLEM IS THERE ARE ONLY 2 OF US IN OUR FAMILY AND I SOMETIMES HAVE THE REAR SEATS FOLDED DOWN AND THE CARGO AREA IS FULL. THERE WOULD BE NO SAFE PLACE LEFT FOR HER TO BE SEATED IN THE VEHICLE. IF THE NHTSA REQUIRES AIRBAGS IT SHOULD REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURER TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM IS NOT DEFECTIVE. I HAVE THE SUBARU STARLINK SYSTEM AND RECEIVED AN EMAIL TODAY THAT THEY WERE NOTIFIED OF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM ISSUE. THE VEHICLE IS ALWAYS IN MOTION WHEN THIS OCCURS AND IS EITHER ON A CITY STREET OR HIGHWAY. IT HAS OCCURRED NO LESS THAN 8 TIMES AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN MADE AWARE TWICE PRIOR TO TODAY.",
