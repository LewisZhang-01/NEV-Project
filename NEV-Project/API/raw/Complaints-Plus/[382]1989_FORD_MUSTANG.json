DRIVING, BREAKING OR EXCELLING. ITS ALL THE TIME . MY BEST GUESS IS THAT THE SEAT BELT MECHANISM IS OLD AND WORE OUT.    SPEEDOMETER STOPPED WORKING ABOUT 8 MONTHS AGO. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS 131,000 ORIGINAL MILES ON THE MOTOR.  NO IDEA WHY THE SPEEDOMETER JUST STOPPED WORKING  AS I WAS DRIVING IN TOWN GOING ABOUT 35 MILES PER HOUR.    OVERDRIVE STOPPED WORKING. NO WARNING, NO OCCASIONAL SLIPS. JUST STOPPED WORKING  WHILE SWITCHING INTO OVERDRIVE IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE AT ALL. HAVE TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER 50 MILES PER HOUR AS CAR WON'T SHIFT INTO NEXT GEAR.   MY GUESS IS CHANGE TRANSMISSION.  LOOKING FOR ONE NOW TO EITHER REBUILD IT OR GET A NEW ONE.     SWITCHES, DRIVER SIDE SWITCH WOULD NOT CATCH THE WINDOW TO ROLL UP OR DOWN,, THEN THE SWITCH PLATE WOULD STICK AND STARTED SMOKING. I REPLACED THE SWITCH    TWICE NOW WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.     INTERIOR LIGHTING FOR SPEEDOMETER GAGES ARE NO LIGHTS. UNABLE TO SEE GAGES.     ***I DO REALIZE THE CAR IS 31 YEARS OLD NOW. AND MAY JUST BE OLD AGE GETTING TO MY FOXBODY. *** THANK YOU",

WE FINISHED THE TRIP WE WERE ON WITH JUST THE HEADLAMPS AND THEY DID NOT FLICKER.  WE DID NOT BRING THE CAR BACK TO TOWN UNTIL AUGUST AND I TOOK IT TO IMMEL MOTORS FORD DEALER IN FREDERICKSBURG, TX.  THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  AFTER WE GOT IT OUT IT CONTINUED TO FLICKER IF WE USED THE FOG LAMPS SO WE QUIT USING THEM.  I RECENTLY FOUND THAT THERE IS A TSB 891711 AUG 89 THAT IDENTIFIES THAT PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE IT AFFECTS MORE THAN JUST THE 1989 MUSTANGS.  I ALSO BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT IT HAS CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLY EVEN DEATHS.  I WAS TOLD BY FORD THAT THERE WAS NOT A RECALL AND THAT I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING TO REPAIR IT, BUT IMMEL MOTORS DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO TO REPAIR THE ISSUE.  I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED A LONG TIME AGO.  I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF VEHICLES OUT THERE BEING AFFECTED.  *TR",
