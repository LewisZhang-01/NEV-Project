In April 2021 my engine light came on. I got a diagnostic and the error code read: P2016 Intake Manifold Runner Position Sensor/Switch Circuit Low Bank 1. I didn\u2019t get it fixed. Shortly after, I began hearing a faint crackling noise and noticed when I would drive on turn pikes my a red brake symbol would briefly pop up on my dash board and then go away. In May 2021 my horn stopped working and front right turn signal light stopped working. I tried to get a new one installed it wouldn\u2019t work. I was told it could be an electrical issue. In July 2021 my right low beam head light stopped working. I tried to get a new bulb installed and it still wouldn\u2019t work. At this time I was told the same thing, that it seems like there may be an electrical issue. This month, November 2021,  a few days ago on Monday November 1st, I began noticing an acceleration issue in the morning. I would press the accelerator and it wouldn\u2019t pick up until a few seconds later, it was like a delay. Later that day while I was driving on the free way a red flash symbol with lines between it began flashing on my car and my car wouldn\u2019t drive over 20 mph. I pulled over. Shortly after I turned my car back on and it began driving semi normal and I was able to get home. I tried out my car the next day and in the morning the same thing happened again. The red flash symbol with 2 lines on the side of it began flashing on my dashboard and my car wouldn\u2019t go over 20 mph. I\u2019m not sure what the issue is but when I looked up what the red flashing symbol, I noticed a few others who had a similar experience with their 2008 Chrysler Sebring which made me want to look up whether there was a recall and I found out there was but when I searched whether my car was eligible through my VIN number it said there was none unrepaired.",

I WOULD BE AT A LIGHT, STOP SIGN, OR PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC AND IT WOULD JUST STALL. SO I HAD THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED AT NOT EVEN 70,000 MILES WHICH SOLVED THE STALLING ISSUE. THEN ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I NOTICED WHEN I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE DRIVING TO TAMPA FROM ORLANDO AND I PUT THE CRUISE CONTROL ON AND MY CAR STARTED SLOWING DOWN ON I4 AND ALMOST GOT ME HIT BY A SEMI TRUCK BUT HE WAS THANKFULLY ABLE TO SWERVE INTO THE LANE BESIDE ME. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND TOLD THEM THE ISSUE AND THEY SAID WELL THERE IS A RECALL ON THE TPMS BUT YOUR VIN NUMBER DOESN'T MATCH AND TURNED ME AWAY. THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY PASSENGER SIDE DOOR NOT LOCKING AND THE WINDOW GOING UP BEFORE THE DOOR WAS SHUT, AND WOULD HAVE TO MESS WITH IT TO GET THE DOOR TO ACTUALLY SHUT. THEN ABOUT 8 MONTHS AGO MY RPMS WHERE JUMPING ERECTLY AND MY DAD WHO IS A MECHANIC CLEANED ALL THE CARBON OUT IN MY MOTOR AND I WAS STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. THEN TODAY MY CAR SHIFT WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF PARK AND MY DADS FRIEND NOTICED THE CABLE IN THE MOTOR WAS POPPED OUT AND POPPED IT BACK IN. SO I DRIVE TO CLASS AND WHEN I GET ON CAMPUS AND GO TO PARK MY CAR MY VAR GETS STUCK IN REVERSE AND I HAD TO SIT IN THERE FOR OVER AN HOUR WITH MY FOOT ON THE BREAK BEFORE SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO HELP ME. THIS CAR NEEDS A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION AND CHRYSLER REFUSES TO HELP ME WHEN I HAVE LESS THAN 95,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND MY ISSUES MATCH THERE RECALL PERFECTLY. THESE ISSUES COULD LEAD ME OR SOMEONE ELSE TO GET KILLED OR SERIOUSLY HURT, BUT I GUESS THEY WONT DUE ANYTHING UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE GET KILLED OR INJURED TO REALIZE THERES A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.",

I CUT THE CAR OFF AND STARTED IT BACK UP AND IT DIDN'T DO IT ANYMORE. UNTIL THE OTHER DAY WHEN EXITING OFF THE INTERSTATE THE CAR LOST SPEED AND THE SAME LIGHT CAME ON. THE RESTARTING TRICK DIDN'T WORK. THE CAR RUNS SHAKY AND IS IDLED UP HIGH WHEN STARTED. THE CAR STILL WON'T ACCELERATE OVER 20MPH. HAD IT DIAGNOSED AND DISCOVERED THE THROTTLE BODY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE INTAKE MANIFOLD RUNNER VALVE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT OWN THIS CAR 2007/2008 HAVE THIS PROBLEM. WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY BE DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE!",

PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE FOR ALL CHRYSLER/DODGE OWNERS, 2007-PRESENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL FAILURES CAUSED BY A SOFTWARE GLITCH IN THE TIPM.

I COULD NOT STEER MY CAR, MY STEERING WHEEL WAS VERY LOOSE AND THERE WAS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE VEHICLE ITSELF.

EVERYTHING IN THE CAR GOES OFF AS IF SOMEONE HAS TURNED THE IGNITION KEY TO OFF POSITION. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS THERE ARE NO WARNING TO THE POSSIBILITY THE CAR IS ABOUT TO STALL. TUESDAY 1/29/13 I TOOK MY CAR TO A LOCAL REPAIR CHAIN AS IT CONTINUED TO STALL AND THEY REPORTED NOT FINDING ANYTHING ELECTRICAL WRONG WITH THE CAR NOR MECHANICAL. HOWEVER, THEY SUGGESTED THAT WHEN CARS STALL SOMETIMES IT MAY BE THE SPARK PLUGS MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED. SO BASED ON THEIR SUGGESTION I HAD THE SPARK PLUGS REPLACED/TUNE UP. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS I DROVE HOME CAR STALLED. ON WEDNESDAY 1/20/13, I TOOK THE CAR TO ANOTHER TRUSTED MECHANIC AND THEY REPORTED THE PROBLEM BEING ELECTRICAL AND MANUFACTURED DUE TO HOW THE CAR TOTALLY SHUTS DOWN AND NOT REGISTERING WITH THE DASH BOARD A PROBLEM. ON 1/31/13 I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP ONLY FOR THEM TO CONFIRM, SO FAR, WHAT THE OTHER TWO MECHANICS ALREADY TOLD ME, ITS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THAT IS NOT SHOWING UP ON DASH. FOR THREE DAYS THE CAR STALLED APRX. 11 TIMES AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND/OR IN MOTION. I HAVE READ THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2007-2008 CHRYSLER SEBRING'S HOWEVER WHEN I CALLED CHRYSLER I WAS TOLD THAT DID NOT INCLUDE MY CAR DUE TO IT BEING MANUFACTURED A MONTH LATER THAN THE RECALL CARS. HOWEVER, THE RECALL NOTICE DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY CAR. I HAVE ALSO COMMUNICATED WITH 2 OTHER PEOPLE TO WHOM HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SAME STALLING ISSUES WITH THE SAME YEAR AND MODEL CAR. I JUST HOPE IT DOES NOT TAKE SOMEONE LOSING THEIR LIFE BEFORE CHANGES ARE MADE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

SOMETIMES LIGHTLY AND OFTEN TIMES VERY HEAVY WITH WAKE WATER COMING OFF OF OTHER CARS AND TRUCKS ON A VERY BUSY CA HIGHWAY.  MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING DURING HEAVY DOWNPOUR TWICE.  HAD TO CRAWL OFF THE FREEWAY WHILE UNABLE TO SEE BECAUSE OF NO WIPERS.  HAD TO WAIT AT LEAST 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY WOULD WORK AGAIN AFTER THE FIRST FAILURE.  WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL USING THE DELAYED INTERMITTENT SEQUENCE UNTIL RAIN GOT TOO HEAVY.  WHEN SWITCHED TO FASTER WIPING AFTER TEN MINUTES WIPERS STOPPED AGAIN.  LUCKILY AGAIN I WAS ABLE TO CRAWL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND I WAITED FOR THE RAIN TO STOP.  I HAVE NOT HAD THIS HAPPEN BEFORE AND I HAVE DRIVEN LONG AND SHORT DISTANCES IN THE RAIN.   ANOTHER ISSUE IS I HAVE HAD ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND 1/2, THE CAR SHUT OFF/STALL WHILE WAITING AT RED LIGHTS, AND ONCE WHILE THE CAR WAS MOVING IT STARTED TO STALL.  AT NO TIME DID THE ENGINE MALFUNCTION LIGHT,OR ELECTRICAL LIGHT COME ON OR STAY ON.  I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER TECHNICIANS/MECHANICS THAT UNLESS THE LIGHT STAYS ON THEY CAN'T DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. OTHERWISE THE FAILURE HAD TO BE DUPLICATED, I.E, HAVE TO OCCUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE TECHNICIANS.  WELL YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.  I UNDERSTAND THAT MY CAR WAS NOT PART THE 08V152000 RECALL, BUT THIS SITUATION IS DANGEROUS.  PLEASE HELP.",

AFTER MY CAR CAME TO A STOP I ATTEMPTED TO RE-START AND IT FAILED.  I THEN PLACED THE CAR IN PARK, TOOK THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION, PUT IT BACK IN AND THE CAR CRANKED UP.  I DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP MONDAY (7/21/08) MORNING AND GOT IT BACK LATER THE SAME DAY WITH ZERO HELP.  THEY SAID NOTHING CAME UP WHEN THEY HOOKED IT UP TO THE COMPUTERS.  SO IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO LET THEM KNOW. THAT CHRYSLER HAD NO RECALLS OR REPORTED ISSUES FOR THIS PROBLEM. I WENT ON-LINE YESTERDAY AND LEARNED A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED VISITING OTHER WEBSITES'INCLUDING YOURS (RECALL NUMBER: 08V152000) AND IT'S NOT POSTED ON CHRYSLER'S WEBSITE.  I CALLED CHRYSLER TO NOTIFY THEM THAT I HAVE 2008 SEBRING AND NEED TO BE INCLUDED ON THIS RECALL AND THAT I HADN'T RECEIVED A NOTICE.  THEY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL AND I'M OUT OF LUCK.  I THEN CALLED THE TALLAHASSEE, FL DEALERSHIP BACK AND TOLD THEM ALL THE INFORMATION I FOUND ONLINE AND THAT I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND I DON'T WANT TO END UP AS A STATISTIC ON THE SIDE OF THE RODE.  THE DEALERSHIP THEN SAID FOR ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK SO THEY CAN LOOK AT IT AGAIN.  I'M CURRENTLY DRIVING A RENTAL.  *TR",
