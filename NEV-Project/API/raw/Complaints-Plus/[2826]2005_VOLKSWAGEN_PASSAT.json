        "summary": "Approximately back in June 2021, I noticed the smell of diesel fuel coming from the rear of the vehicle, noticed hours and days after the vehicle was parked. The smell is partially present from the interior in the trunk area, but mostly evident when standing near the vicinity of the fuel tank when outside of the vehicle. After driving the vehicle, I occasionally notice small puddles of diesel fuel (as evidenced by the oily texture and smell) coming from below the fuel tank. On occasion, I can also spot actual drops of diesel fuel on the lower car frame from underneath the vicinity of the fuel pump. These puddles usually evaporate or dissipate within an hour or two after appearing. Given that these puddles only appear after driving, and not after extended periods of the vehicle sitting in my driveway, I suspect that there is a leak in the fuel pump. A more recent VCDS scan of the ECU on 29 October 2021 results in a Gateway and Dashboard fault code in the fuel pump, which may or may not be related to the fuel pump leak. The fault code is 00476, relating to the fuel pump control module, indicating \"no communication\"; the code is marked as \"static\". This fault code may not be related to the underlying fuel leak, but since it relates to the fuel pump, I thought it would be worth mentioning.   Last but not least, a recall notice was issued on the diesel fuel pump assembly that impacted the make and model of my vehicle, issued in December 2004, just a couple months before the manufacture date of my vehicle (February 2005). As a result of this cut-off date, my vehicle's VIN number was not included in the official recall notice (NHTSA #     04V586000); see: https://www.vindecoderz.com/EN/Volkswagen/PASSAT/2005/fuel%20system,%20diesel/recall/04V586000. Due to the commonality of my vehicle's components with the 2004 Volkswagen Passat TDI and close temporal proximity to the recall notice, I highly suspect that my vehicle's fuel pump is impacted by this latent recall.",

I VERBALIZED IN MANY CONVERSATIONS THE SAFETY CONCERN THIS POSED NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY BUT FOR OTHERS WHO HAD THE POTENTIAL TO FACE THE SAME SITUATION.

WE PURCHASED IT USED AND AT AROUND 185,000-190,000 (LOW MILES BY DIESEL ENGINE STANDARDS), THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE BEING DRIVEN. I LOST POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. DIAGNOSTICS REVEALED THAT THE CHAIN DRIVEN OIL PUMP ASSEMBLY HAD MALFUNCTIONED. THE CHAIN BROKE AND GOT ALL UP IN THE ENGINE AND OIL WAS NO LONGER BEING PUMPED INTO THE ENGINE SO THE ENGINE WAS DESTROYED REQUIRING A COMPLETE ENGINE REPAIR. ABOUT 16,000 MILES LATER, I WAS DRIVING AND THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED. DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL VEHICLE. VOLKSWAGEN HAS ISSUED AN INTERNAL TECHNICAL BULLETIN TELLING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE FIX IS CHANGING OUT THE CHAIN DRIVEN ASSEMBLY WITH A GEAR DRIVEN ONE. THEY ALSO NEVER MADE ANOTHER MODEL WITH A CHAIN DRIVEN ASSEMBLY AFTER THAT MODEL YEAR. SO THEY BASICALLY ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A FAULTY SYSTEM YET WON'T ISSUE A RECALL. CHANGING OUT THE ASSEMBLY IS $1500 FOR THE PART ALONE AND IF YOU'RE CHANGING OUT THAT PART, THE CHANCES ARE GOOD IT'S BECAUSE IT FAILED AND YOU NOW HAVE A DESTROYED ENGINE AS WELL WHICH IS A SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLAR JOB EVEN FOR A USED ENGINE. THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL WHEN IT'S GOING TO FAIL AND IT'S NOT PART OF ANY MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE. VOLKSWAGEN HAS TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT A COMMON ENOUGH PROBLEM TO ISSUE A RECALL AND YET IT'S A COMMON ENOUGH PROBLEM TO HAVE TO ISSUE A TECHNICAL BULLETIN ABOUT IT. I FIND IT ABOMINABLE THAT THEY KNOW THIS HAS AND IS HAPPENING WITH THIS VEHICLE AND THEY ARE NOT LETTING PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT. EVEN IF THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR IT TO BE FIXED, THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY ARE DRIVING A TICKING TIME BOMB. SOMEONE COULD GET KILLED IF THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN ON THEM WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEEDS ON A HIGHWAY. NO POWER STEERING. NO BRAKES. IT'S COMPLETELY UNETHICAL.  *TR",

THE ROAD WAS GOING TO SPLIT GOING 84 EAST AND 383 SE.  84 WAS STILL 8 LANES WHEN MY CAR COMPLETELY DIED - NO GAS WAS GETTING TO THE ENGINE.  I HAD SEMI TRACTOR TRAILER VERY CLOSE BEHIND ME, THE TIME WAS 5:30 - RUSH HOUR, EVERYONE WAS SPEEDING, AND I WAS SHUT DOWN IN LANE 4.  AT THIS POINT, THANKFULLY AND MIRACULOUSLY, THE 2 HIGHWAYS SPLIT AND IT WAS ALL I COULD DO BUT FALL INTO THE NEWLY CREATED BREAKDOWN LANE; OTHERWISE I DON'T SEE HOW I COULD HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE ROAD.  THERE WAS NO, NONE, NO WARNING THAT THE CAR WAS GOING TO DIE, NO LIGHTS, NO SHAKING, NO ALARM.    I CALLED THE STATE POLICE TO GET ME OFF THE HIGHWAY.  AS IT WAS FRIDAY EVENING, AAA COULD ONLY TOW ME TO A PEP BOYS AND AS IT WAS 7 PM BY THIS TIME, I HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A RESIDENCE 6 IN MANCHESTER CN.  PEP BOYS LOOKED AT THE CAR THE NEXT DAY AND DETERMINED THAT NO FUEL WAS GETTING TO THE ENGINE; I WOULD NEED A NEW FUEL PUMP. ALSO, FOR NO OTHER REASON THAT IT WAS INTERESTING, APPARENTLY A 2004 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE PUMP HAD BEEN PUT ON MY (NEW) 2005 FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE CAR.  I AM TOLD THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL.

THE MECHANIC TELLS US THAT IT MIGHT BE \"SLUDGE\" OR THE OIL PUMP IS SHOT.  EITHER OF WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON ANY VEHICLE ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAS ONLY 89000 MILES.  THIS PROBLEM IS TYPICAL WITH THIS MOTOR AND WAS RECALLED UP TO THE MODEL YEARS 2004. THE 1.8 L TURBO MOTOR IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE MOTOR FOR THIS AND JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR YEAR DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  ONE ONLY HAS TO SEARCH ON LINE TO SEE THAT THEIR IS AND HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM.  VW OF AMERICA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECALL AND THEIR CULPABILITY UP TO 2004, IN AN EMAIL TO ME, BUT BECAUSE OF OUR NEWER VIN HAS DENIED COVERAGE.  *TR",

MY OWN PASSAT HAD THE OIL PUMP AND BALANCE SHAFT REPLACED 2/16/09 WITH LESS THAN 65,000 MILES. THANKFULLY, A GOOD MECHANIC DETECTED THE PROBLEM BEFORE I HAD A CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE. A $3,500 REPAIR IS NEVER WELCOME, BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN REPLACING THE ENGINE LIKE THE VW DEALER RECOMMENDED. I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM AND INQUIRED AT SEVERAL VW DEALERSHIPS AND CHOSE THE MOST EXPERIENCED MAN TO DO THE JOB.    RECENTLY, VOLKSWAGEN IN EUROPE RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND DESIGNED A REPAIR WHICH CHANGES THE CHAIN DRIVEN OIL PUMP TO A GEAR DRIVEN OIL PUMP. THIS APPEARS TO BE A PERMANENT FIX TO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN DEFECT. THE REPAIR IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. PARTS WILL COST IN EXCESS OF $1,400 AND LABOR WILL BE IN EXCESS OF $1,200 AT MOST SHOPS.    I BELIEVE IT IS NOW OBVIOUS THAT ALL THE BHW ENGINES WILL FAIL UNLESS THE GEAR DRIVEN OIL PUMP MODIFICATION IS UNDERTAKEN. IT IS UNFAIR TO EXPECT OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. THE PROBLEM ORIGINATED WITH A FLAWED DESIGN. THIS IS NOT A SMALL PROBLEM, AS THIS DESIGN FLAW WILL LEAD TO TOTAL ENGINE FAILURE. MY WIFE NORMALLY DRIVES THE CAR AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE PUT THROUGH THIS. IF THE FAILURE OF THE CHAIN CAUSES ENGINE TO STOP RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC, MERGING ONTO A HIGHWAY, OR PASSING ON THE HIGHWAY, THIS CONDITION COULD EASILY CAUSE DANGER TO ALL CITIZENS NEARBY, POSSIBLY LEADING TO DEATH.      I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT STEPS VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA IS TAKING TO INFORM 2004 AND 2005 PASSAT TDI OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM. GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP WOULD RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM OF THIS SEVERITY AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO THE OWNERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THESE ENGINE FAILURES COULD LEAVE MOTORISTS STRANDED UNDER DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEIR SAFETY IS AT RISK. *TR",
