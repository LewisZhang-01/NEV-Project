VEHICLE HAS A ONE STAGE IGNITER. THE HARNESS WAS DIFFERENT CAUSING HORN TO BE INOP.\"  THE CAR WAS RETURNED WITH THE ORIGINAL AIRBAG (OR ONE THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT) AND THE HORN NOW WORKS.    EVERYTHING I HAVE RESEARCHED ONLINE STATES THAT THESE 2 SYSTEMS (SINGLE STAGE & DUAL STAGE AIRBAGS) ARE NOT COMPATABLIE WITH WIRING AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND WILL NOT FUNCTION.  HAD I NOT CHECKED THE HORN THE CAR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RETURNED FOR  MONTHS UNTIL THE NEXT INSPECTION AND MY WIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING WITHOUT A FUCTIONAL AIRBAG.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THIS THAT THE CAR WAS SAFE THAT THEY RETURNED TO ME ON JUNE 12. IF THAT WAS TRUE, WHY DID THEY PUT THE ORIGINAL BAG BACK ON THE CAR.

AT THIS POINT THE TRACTION SYSTEM MAY NOT HAVE FAILED YET. HOWEVER, I SPUN OUT LEFTWARD, AND THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE. I CROSSED ON-COMING TRAFFIC, AND GAINED CONTROL BEFORE LEAVING THE ASPHALT AND POTENTIALLY HITTING A TELEPHONE POLE. HOWEVER, ONCE I HAD THE CAR UNDER CONTROL AFTER LOSING TRACTION AND SLIDING ACROSS TRAFFIC, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CONTROL SYSTEM THREW ME INTO A SECOND SPIN THAT I HAD NO CONTROL OVER, AND I ENDED UP GOING BACKWARDS AGAINST TRAFFIC. THE SYSTEM WANTED TO GO BACKWARDS. I WORKED SO HARD THAT MY HANDS WERE BLEEDING AFTERWARDS. I KNOW THE SYSTEM HAD FAILED BECAUSE THE TRACTION INDICATOR LIGHT WAS ON, AND WHEN I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND ON AGAIN, THE TRACTION SYSTEM WOULD NOT TURN BACK ON (INDICATOR LIGHT REMAINED ON) FOR . SO THE CAUSE APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FAILURE, NOT A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM, AND THUS REPLACING MY SYSTEM MAY NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I WOULD HAVE DIED IF THERE WAS ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND THEN THE CAUSE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOWN. SO THIS INCIDENT IS REAL, BUT MAY ONLY OCCUR UNDER STRESS.

IT SEEMS TO BE \"WORKING OK\" NOW THOUGH (NO INDICATOR LIGHTS - SYSTEM TURNS BACK ON). IN SUMMARY, THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM FAILS UNDER STRESS AND THEN TRIES TO STEER THE CAR BACKWARDS.

UPON INSPECTION, THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR DIFFERENTIAL MOUNT HAS MULTIPLE STRESS FRACTURES AND SEPERATIONS AT THE POINT WHERE THE MOUNT IS WELDED TO THE UNI-BODY.

IN FACT, BMW GERMANY HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND COVERS THE COST OF REPAIRS, THEY EVEN HAVE A METHOD OF REPAIR.     THIS SITUATION IS VERY DANGEROUS AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.
