        "summary": "The rear camera/head unit freezes with an image of what was behind the vehicle when placed in reverse.  This recently caused an issue where a group of people walked behind my Jeep while pulling out. Both myself and the group were fortunate enough that I caught one of the people walking behind my Jeep and stopped before backing into them with the backup camera still showing a clear path.  This issue has been documented with Jeep and was serviced November of 2021.  They replaced the unit but after a few months the new head unit started crashing and I am still having this intermittent issue where the screen shows a static image for the rear view upon placing the Jeep in reverse.  No warning lamps or messages are shown.  Eventually the watchdog timer times out after about a minute and the system reboots.    The head unit will also crash randomly at other times while driving but this is the only instance it puts safety at risk.  I would estimate it occurs 2-5% of the time I back out.  Before I took the Jeep in for service I documented, in detail, each time the unit crashed and gave it to the service tech, I will send it to you as well when I locate the file.  I also attached links to video showing a 2 examples at various different times this occurred, including an instance today.  https://photos.app.goo.gl/pvrpoP44CjFHHfvN6 https://photos.app.goo.gl/ALu3dAw6Sarz3jzJ6",

        "summary": "Driving on I-35 North (Texas) in the morning requires driving directly into the sun rise. I utilize my sun visor daily in order to maintain a safe view of the road, where people are frequently driving over 80 miles per hour. One morning on the way to work, I put my sun visor down so that I could see past the sun glare on my windshield. The sun visor then fell from its open position as I went over a bump in the road. At this point, the visor was hanging several inches lower than it normally does, almost completely obscuring my view of the road. The visor was not able to fall completely, because it was attached to the top of the car via electrical wiring. If it had fallen completely, I would have been in a much safer position. I needed to pull over ASAP but was unable to do so due to the construction on the highway and therefore had to hold the visor up with one hand while driving with the other until I could find a safe place to stop. The visor is still in the same state as it was when it initially failed. I have had to tape it up and am therefore unable to use it at all. There is no replacement part for the failed piece of plastic within the visor's housing. It requires replacement of the entire assembly, and that will contain the same part that failed in the first place. This seems to be a fairly common problem and has been discussed at length online, including at this website: https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/sun-visor-fix.44865/",

The dealership refused to submit the claim to Chrysler corp nor would they put down their statement about the \"soy based wiring\" when I raised legal issues, they refused to work on my vehicle even if I paid as they stated\" they dont want the publicity\".

I turned it off again and after about 15 minutes, my steering wheel was unlocked. I took my car to the dealership and had them take a look at it. A few days later, they \"fixed\" it and told me it was a battery issue and that it was resolved. Two days later, the exact same thing happened AGAIN while I was on a 1 way street. It was INCREDIBLY dangerous, because it happened right before I had to go up an S curve. It was in the middle of a storm and there were a lot of cars going the other way and a lot of cars behind me. I turned on my hazard lights and had to go up the curve very slowly and there was somewhere I could turn right. Since my steering wheel was locked, I wasn't able to turn onto the street and ended up in a patch of grass. My car is currently at the dealership again.

I AM LOVING EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAR EXCEPT THE STEERING. THE STEERING ON THIS VEHICLE IS TERRIBLE AND DANGEROUS!!! THE STEERING IS LOOSE AND ON IT'S OWN, IT WILL DRIFT OR FLOAT TO EITHER SIDE, RIGHT OR LEFT, ON A SMOOTH DRY SURFACE AT VIRTUALLY ANY SPEED. IT IS EVEN WORSE AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  IT CANNOT STEER STRAIGHT LIKE ANY NORMAL VEHICLE.   THIS IS A SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT JEEP SHOULD BE INSTITUTING A RECALL AND REPAIR ORDER FOR! I'VE INSTRUCTED MY FAMILY MEMBERS TO CONTACT OUR ATTORNEY IF ANYONE IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT RECEIVES INJURY, SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. MY FAMILY MEMBERS WILL INFORM OUR ATTORNEY THAT THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM EXISTED SINCE THE DAY IT WAS PURCHASED AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER (JEEP) KNEW ABOUT THIS FROM NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND YET SO FAR HAS FAILED TO INSTITUTE A RECALL FOR REPAIR.  CHECK ONLINE AND YOU WILL FIND MANY OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR NEW WRANGLER'S STEERING PROBLEM. ONLINE AFTERMARKET COMPANIES ARE ATTEMPTING TO SELL PRODUCTS THAT \"MAY\" RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WHY SHOULD ANY NEW OWNER HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON AN AFTER MARKET PRODUCT FOR A BRAND NEW CAR? IF JEEP DOES NOT INITIATE A RECALL, I WILL WRITE COMPLAINTS AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS EVERYWHERE I CAN AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I PURCHASE ONE.  I WILL RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE NOT TO PURCHASE A JEEP PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THIS GROSS NEGLIGENCE.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I WAS BLOWN AWAY, I HAD JUST PAID OVER $50,000 FOR A BRAND NEW JEEP THAT HAD 3 MILES ON IT AND IT HAD A PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD TO CALL SOME 800 NUMBER AND MAYBE THEY COULD HELP ME.  I COMPLAINED AGAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEM TO MY SALESMAN AND HE SCHEDULED A SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  I TOOK THE JEEP IN AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DONE AN ALIGNMENT AND THAT THE TIRES WERE A LITTLE OVER INFLATED SO THEY BROUGHT THEM TO FACTORY PRESSURE.  AGAIN, THIS IS A BRAND NEW JEEP THAT THEY HAD JUST RAN THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL PDI WHEN THEY COME OFF THE TRUCK.  SO IF THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS WRONG, THEN IT WAS WRONG BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHECK IT.  I RECEIVED THE JEEP BACK AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  I'M HONESTLY AT MY WHITS END WITH IT.  I FOUND ONLINE THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AND THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD GET SOME HELP FROM YOU GUYS.",

CAN FEEL IT RESISTING ME WANTING TO GO BACK OFF CENTER TO THE RIGHT. THERE IS PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WANTS TO STAY OFF CENTER ALL THE TIME.  3.) STEERING WHEEL WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN IMMEDIATELY COMES BACK TOWARDS CENTER TO THE RIGHT AND FEELS LIKE IT RESISTS WHEN WANTING TO TURN LEFT; HOWEVER, WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN, THERE IS NO RESISTANCE AND IT DOES NOT COMEBACK TO CENTER WILLINGLY AS IT SHOULD.
