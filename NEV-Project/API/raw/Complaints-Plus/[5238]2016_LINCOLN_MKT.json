To my dismay there is nothing that can be done since this is not a mechanical defect.  So at this point I am going to definitely cancel the extended CarMax care that I did sign up for him to help offset my cost for my deductible to deal with this damage. I would regret not turning around and returning the car on May 4 just because I heard the sound and had no idea what the consequences of that would turn into. I will also convey this in the survey request that I have received from Carmax. Taking this up any further would only cause me more frustration and money, But at this juncture I will definitely speak with a lawyer to see what my options are that way sinceI am now stuck with this vehicle. Granted had I known it had started breaking the glass on the third I would\u2019ve returned it at any Carmax between Colorado and Delaware.",

IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOUD GUNSHOT NEAR YOU AND ITS VERY SCARY I ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I SWERVED TO NEXT LANE DUE TO BEING SCARED OF THE LOUD NOISE. FIRST TIME I WAS ON MY WAY TO RENO AND I HAD TO KEEP GOING BUT IT WAS HELL AND ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. PART OF THE GLASS FLEW OFF WITHIN MINUTES OF ME DRIVING SO RAIN GOT INTO MY CAR. I HAD TO TAPE A TARP DOWN WITH GORILLA TAPE TO GET TO A SAFE DESTINATION. THERE WAS GLASS INSIDE THE CAR AND MY LITTLE BROTHER GOT CUT ON HIS ARM, THIS GLASS IS THICK AND HEAVY! THE SECOND TIME WAS 8 MONTHS AFTER I HAD IT REPAIRED. RAINING AGAIN BUT THIS TIME I WAS AT A  STOP LIGHT WHEN I HEARD THE GUNSHOT NOISE AND I IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS SCARED BUT SO VERY UPSET THAT IT HAPPENED AGAIN JUST MONTHS APART. IT'S VERY UPSETTING THAT LINCOLN HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THIS AS A DEFECT ON THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS BLOGS AS ON HERE THE SAME COMPLAINT FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE US THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO. IT'S SO UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND UPSETTING BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE THE VEHICLE OTHER THAN THAT HUGE DEFECT. ON TOP OF THAT THIS REPAIR IS COSTLY, GLASS ALONE IS $1400-1600 WITHOUT LABOR IN MY AREA. I HOPE THAT LINCOLN WILL SOON TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND I PLAN TO KEEP FIGHTING THIS FIGHT AS I HAVE A FEELING THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I FEEL SO UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE NOW.
