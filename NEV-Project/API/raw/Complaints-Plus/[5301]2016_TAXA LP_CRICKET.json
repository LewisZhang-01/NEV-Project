THE A-FRAME AND TOWING VEHICLE WERE CLOSE TO SEPARATING FROM THE MAIN SECTION OF THE TRAILER, IN SUCH A WAY THAT  THE TRAILER WOULD RUN AWAY UNCONTROLLABLY.  TRAILER FRAME WAS UNMODIFIED AND TRAILER USAGE WAS WITHIN INTENDED USE.  CRACK LIKELY FORMED DURING NORMAL ROAD GOING USE AND GREW OVER TIME.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS MODEL YEAR, 2016, WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW FRAME DESIGN.",
