AS I PULLED AWAY FROM THE STOP SIGN AND ACCELERATING I HEARD A LOUD POP AND WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXHAUST LEAK. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD. I FOUND THAT THE COIL ON THE #3 SPARK PLUG WAS OUT AND THE EXHAUST SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE HOLE WHERE THE SPARK PLUG SHOULD HAVE BEEN. ONLY LIVING 2 MILES FROM WORK, I DROVE THE TRUCK HOME AND PARKED IT TIL MORNING. IN THE MORNING I WENT OUT AND TRIED TO PUT THE PLUG BACK IN AND REALIZED THERE WERE NO THREADS TO THREAD THE PLUG INTO. THIS IS VERY DISCONCERTING REALIZING THAT THERE WILL BE SOME MAJOR WORK NEEDING TO BE DONE ON THE TRUCK BEFORE I CAN DRIVE IT AGAIN. NOT TO MENTION COST. UPON SOME INTERNET RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THESE FORD TRUCKS AND THAT FORD IS REFUSING TO DO A RECALL ON THIS MATTER. I JUST PURCHASED THIS TRUCK ON 03/12/2012 AND CANNOT DRIVE IT ANY MORE.  I WILL NOT DRIVE IT ANY MORE DUE TO THE SAFETY ASPECT OF THE FUEL VAPORS COMING OUT OF THE HOLE AND POSSIBLY CATCHING FIRE FROM THE SPARK PLUG WIRE STILL ARCING. LEAST OF ALL THAT IT WILL CAUSE MORE DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE BEFORE IT CAN BE REPAIRED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN THIS MATTER AND I AM HOPING THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WILL MAKE FORD DO A RECALL ON THESE TRUCKS AND GET THE PROBLEM FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL.  *TR",
