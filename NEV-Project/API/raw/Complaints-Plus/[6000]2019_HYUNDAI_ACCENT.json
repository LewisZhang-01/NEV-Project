        "summary": "My 2019 Hyundai Accent engine failed at 65,004 miles. I've taken my car to a local Hyundai dealership from December 2020 up until it failing in December 2021, I've had an appointment at least once a month for my check engine light being on. They scheduled me my first appointment December 2020 and later told me they fixed the issue only for it to come back on a couple days later. I call them again letting them know and the schedule me again, same thing happens and the light comes back on a week later. This was an ongoing issue, the dealership kept telling me they fixed it and to make sure the gas cap was tightened but they could never stop my check engine light from coming back on. They told me back in September of 2021 that I had a large evap leak. When it came to finding this leak they were never successful. Fast forward to December 2021 my car started making these weird noises and I immediately brought it up to the same local Hyundai that I've been taking it to since day one. They tell me there is nothing they can do for me since they are booked up until Feb. 2022 and so were all the other dealerships near me. I understood and left then a week or two after this my car completely stops in the middle of the expressway. I had to get my car towed to Hyundai for them to tell e my engine seized, coincidental right? After an entire year of Hyundai not being able to find the issue and fix it my engine magically seizes, a 2019 Hyundai at that meaning the car is still fairly new. The entire time I was taking it there I was under warranty up until 5,004 miles ago. The powertrain warranty for a used car ends at 60,000 miles and now Hyundai expects me to pay for something I had no fault in. I have emailed, complained and spoke to almost everyone I can about this issue. I just want justice to be rightfully served and for Hyundai to cover all expenses towards my new engine replacement.",
