        "summary": "PROBLEM: THE DRIVER SIDE VISOR FELL DOWN FROM THE UP POSITION WHEN TRYING TO PUT IT UP. FOR A WHILE, I WAS ABLE TO GET IT *ALMOST* ALL THE WAY UP, TO PRESERVE VISIBILITY. HOWEVER, I WAS UNABLE TO USE THE VISOR IN ANY OTHER POSITION. UPON TAKING APART THE MOUNT WHICH SECURES THE VISOR TO THE ROOF, I SAW THAT A PLASTIC RING HAD BROKEN OFF THE VISOR ARM. DROVE WITH THE VISOR LOW. TWO-THREE MONTHS LATER, THE PASSENGER SIDE VISOR FELL IN A SIMILAR FASHION. THE PASSENGER VISOR FELL FURTHER THAN THE DRIVER'S ONE, HANGING ONLY FROM THE INTERNAL WIRE. OPENED THE MOUNT AND OBSERVED THE SAME BREAK AT THE PLASTIC RING AT THE END OF THE VISOR SHEATH. ATTEMPTED GLUE REPAIR EACH TIME, WHICH DID NOT FULLY WORK.     ATTEMPTED FIX: IN BOTH CASES, SUPER GLUE DID NOT HOLD & THE RING IS STILL SEPARATED. HOWEVER, RESIDUE FROM THE GLUE ON THE VISOR ARM CAUSES ENOUGH FRICTION TO KEEP THE PLASTIC SHAFTS IN THE CEILING MOUNTS MOST OF THE TIME. THE PASSENGER VISOR FALLS DOWN MOST FREQUENTLY (EVEN THO THIS CAR HAS A SINGLE DRIVER, AND THE PASSENGER SIDE VISOR IS RARELY USED -- USUALLY TO HOLD A SUNSHADE IN THE WINDSHIELD). IT DANGLES FROM THE INTERNAL WIRE, AND IT MUST BE SHOVED BACK IN THE CEILING WITH A GREAT BIT OF FORCE AND TWISTING.    SUMMARY: THE PROBLEM WITH THE VISOR ARM SHEATH IS A DESIGN FLAW. THE SHEATH NARROWS JUST BEFORE IT WIDENS OUT AGAIN TO FORM A RING. THE RING IS THE PART THAT PREVENTS THE VISOR FROM FALLING OUT OF THE CEILING MOUNT. HOWEVER, THE NARROWING OF THE PLASTIC WEAKENS THE ARM AT THE POINT WHERE IT IS BEARING STRESS, WHICH CAUSES IT TO BREAK. THERE'S NO REASON THAT A VISOR SHOULD BREAK WHEN IT'S ONLY USED 5-10% OF THE TIME. IT'S ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY REPAIR EXCEPT BY REPLACING THE ENTIRE VISOR, WHICH IS AROUND $150 EACH AT THE DEALER. HYUNDAI HAS ALREADY ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BY RECALLING THEM ON THE SONATA. ELANTRA OWNERS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS.  *TR",

THIS WILL BE VERIFIED WITH ANOTHER PHONE CALL TO HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE.. MY BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH HAS FAILED AGAIN AND I AM WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS.  I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING AS CRITICAL AND SAFETY ORIENTED AS A SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE BRAKE LIGHT FUNCTION OF YOUR VEHICLE COULD FAIL TWICE WITHIN A 6 YEAR PERIOD. UNLESS BOTH PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE. IN FACT IN MY PAST OWNERSHIP OF MANY VEHICLES AND ALSO OF THE VEHICLES OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS SWITCH FAILING ONCE LET ALONE TWICE!  HYUNDAI IS TELLING ME THAT SINCE THE RECALL WAS ALREADY PERFORMED ON THIS CAR IN 2010 (BEFORE I PURCHASED THE CAR) THAT THEY ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THIS REPAIR OR RECALL. THE CAMPAIGN ID# FOR THE LATEST RECALL IS 13V113000. IT WAS ISSUED BY HYUNDAI-KIA AMERICA TECHNICAL CENTER INC. HOW AM I TO BE SURE THAT WHEN THE CAR WAS REPAIRED (IF IT WAS REPAIRED PROPERLY OR AT ALL) IN 2010 IT WAS NOT REPAIRED WITH THE PART FROM THE CURRENT RECALL? THE VEHICLE HAS YET TO BE REPAIRED AND I WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE ONCE AGAIN.

THE CRASH SMASHED THE DRIVER DOOR, A PORTION OF THE BACK SEAT DOOR AS WELL AS DISLODGING PART OF THE FRONT BUMPER.  MY FRONT TIRE WAS ALSO FLAT AND BENT OUT OF SHAPE.  I WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE DRIVER-SIDE DOOR SO I HAD TO CRAWL OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE.  WHEN I WAS HIT, I FELT AS IF I WAS ABOUT TO PASS OUT.  MY VISION WAS BLACK AND FUZZY AND I FELT LIGHT-HEADED.  I ENDED UP HAVING A LARGE BUMP ON MY HEAD, BRUISES ON MY SHOULDER AS WELL AS A BRUISE ON MY KNEE.  I AM VERY UPSET THAT THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY BECAUSE HAD THE DRIVER BEEN GOING A LITTLE BIT FASTER OR HAD I BEEN IN A MORE SERIOUS ACCIDENT  I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED IF NOT KILLED.  ONE OF THE REASONS I PURCHASED THE CAR WAS BECAUSE OF ITS SO CALLED 5 STAR SAFETY RATING.  HAD I KNOWN HYUNDAI HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEIR AIRBAGS I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I ALSO NOTICED ANOTHER COMPLAINT ON THIS CAR FOR THE SAME REASON.  I FEEL THAT HYUNDAI SHOULD MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE DISFUNCTIONAL AIRBAGS IF NOT RECALL THE VEHICLE ALTOGETHER.
