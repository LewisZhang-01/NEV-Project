AFTER DRIVING TWO WEEKS AND 555 MILES, THE FRONT LEFT TIRE SUDDENLY BLEW OUT IN MY DRIVEWAY. IT APPEARED TO FAIL AT THE BEAD. MY TIRE DEALER TURNED THE TIRE OVER TO A COOPER REP WHO EXAMINED THE TIRE AND SAID THE SHOP INSTALLED IT IMPROPERLY, LEADING TO THE FAILURE. THE SHOP DISAGREED WITH THE FINDING, BUT THEY REPLACED THE TIRE FREE OF CHARGE.     TWO WEEKS AND 154 MILES LATER, I NOTICED THE THREE OTHER COOPERS WERE FAILING. THE REARS HAD SOFTBALL-SIZED BULGES ON THE TIRE WALL EXTENDING FROM THE BEAD TOWARD THE TREAD. THE RIGHT FRONT HAD A BASEBALL-SIZED BULGE IN THE SAME LOCATION. ALL THE BULGES WERE ON THE INBOARD, WHITEWALL SIDE OF THE TIRE.     MY SHOP'S OWNER PERSONALLY PULLED THE TIRES, EXAMINED THEM, AND FOUND BARE BEAD WIRE ADJACENT TO THE BULGE. THE BARE WIRE WAS 1-2 INCHES LONG. HE SAYS THE LOCATION OF THE BARE WIRE/BULGE FALLS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE TIRE DURING MOUNTING--A SPOT NOT CONTACTED BY THE MOUNTING BAR DURING INSTALLATION. FURTHERMORE, HE SAID HE FOUND NO SCUFFING INSIDE THE TIRE INDICATING CONTACT WITH THE MOUNTING BAR AND NO LOOSE RUBBER INSIDE THE TIRE, FURTHER INDICATIVE OF DAMAGE DURING MOUNTING. HE TRUSTS HIS INSTALLER, A 10-YEAR EMPLOYEE WHO INSTALLS 100 TIRES A WEEK. HE'S CONVINCED THE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVELY MANUFACTURED.     MY DEALER HAS FOLLOWED UP WITH COOPER. THE COMPANY INSISTS THE TIRES WERE DAMAGED DURING INSTALLATION, BUT IT WENT AHEAD AND CREDITED THE SHOP THE COST OF THE TIRES.  MY DEALER HAD A SIMILAR FAILURE ON A COOPER LIFELINER SLE TIRE A MONTH EARLIER, AND COOPER DENIED ANY PROBLEMS ON THEIR PART IN THAT INCIDENT AS WELL.

NISSAN REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN THOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THEIR 1993 ENGINES.  FOR 1995 & 1996 MODELS, THEY'VE EXTENDED THEIR WARRANTY TO 100,000 MILES.  THEN, IN 1997, THEY INTRODUCED A NEW DESIGN WHICH CHANGED THE BOLT SIZE FROM 8MM TO 10MM BOLTS (RECTIFYING THE KNOWN PROBLEM).  EVEN WITH SUCH AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, NISSAN REFUSES TO WARRANTEE THE REPAIRS!  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT A RECALL BE ISSUED REQUIRING NISSAN TO UPGRADE THE ENGINE/EXHAUST SYSTEMS IN THE PRE-1997 NISSAN PATHFINDERS (IN THAT, THIS BROKEN MANIFOLD STUDS PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO REOCCUR EVERY 50,000 MILES OR SO).
