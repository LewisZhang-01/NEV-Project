THE SECONDARY ISSUE IS NUMEROUS WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENTS, WHICH MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES DO NOT COVER THEREBY CAUSING RECURRING, AND TREMENDOUS, FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ON AN OWNER.  REAR TAILGATE HATCH: BREAKS AND HANGS BY WIRING HARNESS ALONE, MAKING THE TAILGATE/REAR HATCH VIRTUALLY INACCESSIBLE AND UNUSABLE. THIS THEN BECOMES A NUISANCE FACTOR AS WELL AS A SAFETY HAZARD WHEN AN OWNER WOULD NEED TO ACCESS AND REMOVE THE SPARE TIRE. SINCE LICENSE PLATE ILLUMINATION IS REQUIRED BY LAW, A BROKEN HATCH HANDLE CLEARLY PUTS AN OWNER IN VIOLATION OF THIS LAW, THEREBY CAUSING LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AND EXCESS COST FACTORS WHEN HE OR SHE RECEIVES A TICKET FOR A NON-OPERATIONS TAG LIGHT.  *TR",

MANY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THEM 3-4 TIMES.    I THINK TOYOTA HAS DROPPED THE BALL AND I FEEL REALLY ANGRY. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE OF THE REPUTATION AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH TOYOTA PRODUCTS.
