FOLLOWING THE INITIAL BLUE CLOUD (DEFINITELY NOT BLACK OR WHITE SMOKE), ANY EXHAUST GASES BECAME INVISIBLE (BUT I AM UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER MY TRUCK WAS SMOKING FROM THE EXHAUST WHEN I WAS DRIVING).  I ALSO NOTICED THAT WHEN I STARTED IT UP WHILE IN THE DRIVEWAY (WITH THE INTENTION OF PULLING THE TRUCK INTO MY GARAGE), EVEN IF THERE WAS NO SMOKE VISIBLE THE GARAGE WOULD FILL WITH FUMES ? IT WAS SO BAD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH, EXIT THE TRUCK, AND SPRINT INTO MY HOUSE TO AVOID INHALING THOSE FUMES.    IT QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT TO ME (AS AN AMATEUR MECHANIC) THAT SOMEHOW OIL WAS FINDING ITS WAY INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND WAS BEING BURNED, RESULTING IN THE SMOKE & FUMES.  I THEREFORE TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE HONDA DEALER IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM ISOLATE AND REPAIR THE PROBLEM.    LATER IN THE DAY [XXX] PHONED TO SAY THAT THEIR SERVICE TECHNICIANS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THEREFORE HAD DONE NO SERVICE TO THE TRUCK, AND THAT I SHOULD COME PICK IT UP.  WHEN I ASKED WHAT DIAGNOSTIC SERVICE HAD BEEN PERFORMED, [XXX] TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD STARTED THE TRUCK SEVERAL TIMES AND LET IT RUN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, ALL THE WHILE VISUALIZING THE EXHAUST PIPE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SMOKE: THERE WAS NONE.
