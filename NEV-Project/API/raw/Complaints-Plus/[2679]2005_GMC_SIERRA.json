GM EXHAUST BOLTS ARE TO SMALL BRITTLE FOR SECURING EXHAUST MANIFOLDS. BOLTS SNAP OFF CAUSING EXHAUST LEAKS.     TRUCKS NOT PASSING EMISSIONS AND DANGEROUS EXHAUST FUMES ENTERING THE DRIVERS COMPARTMENT OF THE VEHICLES WHILE DRIVING. I AND MY FAMILY GET A CARBON MONOXIDE HEADACHE WHEN I DRIVE IT AND HAVE HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FEELING LIKE I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT, OPEN WINDOWS AND SIT UNTIL I FELT BETTER.  I HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS GETTING MY TRUCK TO PASS EMISSIONS DUE TO THE LEAKS AND THE LEAKS ARE CAUSING THE VEHICLES TO BE NONE EPA COMPLIANT BECAUSE OF O2 SENSOR ERRORS RESULTING IN FAILED EMISSION TEST.    ALSO BRAKE AND FUEL LINES ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR NORTHERN STATES CAUSING BRAKE FAILURE WITH OUT WARNING,  FUEL LINES ARE ALL RUSTED AND SWELLED IN DANGER OF BURSTING CAUSING FIRE WITHOUT WARNING. FORD AND OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE WORKED ON USE STAINLESS FUEL LINES AND LOOK LIKE NEW FOR LIFE OF VEHICLE. I HAVE ALSO SEEN OTHER MANUFACTURERS USE POWDER COATED BRAKE LINES ON THE ENTIRE VEHICLE AND 20 YEAR OLD VEHILCES SHOW NO RUST PROBLEMS.    MY 2005 GMC FROM THE REAR END BRAKE HOSE TO THE WHEEL CYLINDERS THEY USED POWDER COATED BRAKE LINES. THOSE LINES LOOK LIKE NEW YET. GM KNEW THE POWDER COATED LINES WERE BETTER WHY DID THEY USE FAULTY GALVANIZED STEEL ON THE REST OF THE TRUCK?  AS IT IS NOW MY TRUCK CAN'T BE OPERATED ON THE ROAD WITHOUT $3000 IN REPAIRS DUE TO GM USING POOR QUALITY PARTS. THE TRUCK HAS HAD THESE PROBLEMS FOR OVER 5 YEARS NOW AND ONLY HAS 138,000 MILES. TRUCKS LIKE THIS IN SOUTHERN STATES HAVE OVER 250,000 MILES, LINES STILL GOOD.  RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE.

THIS TIME IT COST ME $500 FOR THE SHIFT MOTOR TO BE REPLACED.   SECOND PROBLEM, SPEEDOMETER READING INCORRECTLY OR NOT AT ALL. BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS SPORADICALLY (APPARENTLY THE LITTLE DRIVE \"MOTOR\" ON THE BACK OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, $300 REPLACEMENT OR, FOUND A COMPANY TO REBUILD WITH NEW \"MOTORS\" FOR UNDER $200). PASSLOCK ISSUES STARTED IN JAN 2014, HAS LEFT ME STRANDED A COUPLE TIMES NOW. CAN'T GET A GOOD ANSWER FROM DEALER AS TO HOW TO REPAIR OTHER THAN \"BRING IT IN AND WE'LL HOOK IT TO OUR DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM\" (I.E. PAY US LOTS OF MONEY). ALSO HAVING ISSUE WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON CONSTANTLY. INTERMITTENT ENGINE MISS ON MULTIPLE CYLINDERS. ROUGH IDLE, CRAPPY MILEAGE, BUT NOT DOWN ON POWER. MISS SEAMS TO GO AWAY OFF IDLE AND NOT NOTICEABLE UNDER LOAD. NEW PLUGS, WIRES, ETC, ETC, ETC.... HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS ONE OUT YET. SAME ANSWER FROM DEALER (PAY US MORE MONEY PLEASE). LASTLY, AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON IN DEC OF 2012. NEVER CRASHED OR BUMPED BUT HAD TO REPLACE LEFT FRONT AIR BAG SENSOR. LOVE THE TRUCK, CURRENTLY HAS 154000 MILES BUT I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED WITH ALL THE LITTLE ELECTRICAL \"GLITCHES\" AND THE DEALER WON'T HELP A BIT WITHOUT THE NORMAL ANSWER, \"BRING IT IN AND WE'LL HOOK IT TO OUR DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM\".

THE JUDGE ASKED THE GMC COMPANY REP WHAT COULD BEEN DONE.  HE SAID  THE SAME THING THAT I HAVE READ BEFORE... THAT IS TO PUT 500 LBS IN THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  THAT DID NOT HELP.

MY TRUCK IS A 2005 GMC SIERRA SLE Z71 CREW CAB (K1500) WITH ONLY 76K+ MILES AND HAS THE 4L60/65E TRANSMISSION.    THIS 4L60E TRANSMISSION IS ALSO USED IN GM TRUCKS COLORADO & CANYON AND WORKS GOOD FOR THESE SMALLER TRUCKS BUT IN THE LARGER SILVERADO & SIERRA CREW CABS THE TRANSMISSION WEARS OUR THE 3-4 CLUTCH PREMATURELY DUE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE TRUCK.    THIS IS A BAD DESIGN AND GM HAS FIXED IT IN THE 2007+ CREW CAB TRUCKS BY USING A 6-SPEED TRANSMISSION INSTEAD OF THE PREVIOUS 4-SPEED.    I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY TRANSMISSION SLIPPED IN 4TH GEAR.  I SHIFTED TO 3RD GEAR AND TRANSMISSION CONTINUED TO SLIP.  THIS WAS DURING RUSH HOUR AND I WAS GOING 65 MPH.  I HAD TO WAIT FOR TRAFFIC TO CLEAR ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SO I COULD GET TO THE SHOULDER WHILE I HAD SEVERAL CARS BEHIND ME WAITING.  MY TRUCK COULD NO LONGER HOLD SPEEDS ABOVE 50 MPH WITHOUT SLIPPING THE TRANSMISSION.  I COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE MY TRUCK COULD NOT ACCELERATE.  THIS IS A POTENTIAL HAZARD.    I HAD THE TRUCK TAKEN TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD I NEED A REBUILD AND THE MOST IT WOULD COST ME IS $3K TO FIX.  I SAID NO THANKS AND PAID THE $45 DIAGNOSES FEE.  I TOLD THEM WHY IF I DO NOT TOW WITH MY TRUCK AND DRIVE PASSIVE TO GET THE BEST MILEAGE AND SOME HOW MY TRANSMISSION NEEDS A REBUILD AT ONLY 76K MILES?  THIS SHOULD NOT BE.  I HAVE A 10 YEAR OLD CAR WITH 193K MILES AND IT HAS NEVER HAD A TRANSMISSION REBUILD.    I HAVE CALLED GM AND THEY SAY THERE IS NO RECALL AND THERE IS NO TRANSMISSION PROBLEM BUT I DISAGREE.  I ASKED THE DEALER TO PROVIDE ME WITH HOW MANY TRANSMISSION REBUILDS THEY HAVE DONE AND THEY SAY THEY DO NOT TRACK THIS INFORMATION.  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GIVE GM ANY FEEDBACK ON HOW MANY REPAIRS THEY DO TO CARS OUT OF WARRANTY. *TR",

THE TRUCK HAS BINDING IN THE FRONT AXLES, BRAKES, OR DIFFERENTIAL.  THIS CAUSES THE TRUCK TO UNDERSTEER HEAVILY AS THE TRUCK WORKS TO TURN THE FRONT WHEELS OVER THE ROAD SURFACE.  THIS ALSO MAKES THE TRUCK DIFFICULT TO STEER, U TURNS ARE ESPECIALLY A PROBLEM, THE TRUCK HAS SLUGGISH ACCELERATION AND STAYS LONGER IN THE LOWER GEARS.  THE REAR TIRES ARE PRONE TO LOSE TRACTION DUE TO THE INCREASED ROLLING RESISTANCE FROM THE FRONT WHEELS, BRAKING PERFORMANCE IS COMPROMISED, THE TRUCK WILL SWAY BACK AND FORTH AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AS THE ROLLING RESISTANCE OF THE FRONT WHEELS VARIES FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  THE TRUCK TENDS TO PULL TO THE LEFT, AND THE SUSPENSION IS ALWAYS PRELOADED FROM THE ADDITIONAL STRESS.  THE ENGINE LABORS TO MAINTAIN SPEED ON LEVEL GROUND WITH THE VEHICLE UNLOADED.  ON OCCASION THE FRONT WHEELS WILL HOP OFF THE PAVEMENT AS IT IS EASIER FOR THEM TO COMPRESS THE SUSPENSION/TORSION BARS THAN BE TURNED OVER THE ROAD.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH THE TRUCK SINCE THE FRONT WHEELS TEND TO FOLLOW THE CONTOURS OF THE ROAD.  THE FRONT WHEEL ASSEMBLIES MAKE A LOW FREQUENCY SOUND WHEN DRIVING.  THE TRANSMISSION, ENGINE, AND DRIVETRAIN COMPONENTS ARE ALWAYS LOADED AND DRIVING ON SNOW OR ICE WOULD BE TREACHEROUS SINCE THE FRONT WHEELS WOULD STOP TURNING ON THE LOW FRICTION SURFACE.  DRIVING IN THE RAIN IS BAD ENOUGH AND THE REAR WHEELS TEND TO BREAK LOOSE.

THIS HAPPENED ON A STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WHERE THERE WAS NO SHOULDER TO PULL OFF ON RESULTING IN AN EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CONDITION. I HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE ON-LINE RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH THE 2004.5 AND 2005 MODEL YEAR CHEVROLET AND GMC HD SERIES TRUCKS EQUIPPED WITH THE DIESEL MOTOR. NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THEIR TRUCKS TO LOCAL CHEVROLET AND GMC DEALERSHIPS BUT GM HAS BEEN UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO HELP THUS FAR. THESE TRUCKS ARE CREATING DANGEROUS SITUATIONS THAT I FEAR WILL RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. *JB",

DEALER REP SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING 80 MPH. THEREFORE SINCE OUR MECHANICS CAN'T SPEED IN YOUR VEHICLE ( COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE) YOU DON'T HAVE A VIBRATION.
