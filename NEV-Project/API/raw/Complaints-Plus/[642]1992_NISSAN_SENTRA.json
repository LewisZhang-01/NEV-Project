NOTHING WAS TOUCHING THE WIRING, NO WIRES WERE EXPOSED, THE WIRING BUNDLE WAS NOT RUBBING UP AGAINST ANYTHING, AND THE WIRING WAS IN ITS ORIGINAL WRAPPED, BUNDLED LOOM.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER CAUSE FOR THIS FIRE EXCEPT THE IGNITION RESISTOR CAPACITOR WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE FACTORY, AND THAT IT FAILED, GOT HOT, AND BURST INTO FLAMES.  HE TOLD ME TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT TO NHTSA AS A DEFECT IN THIS CAR'S WIRING SYSTEM.  (I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW, HAVE NEVER HAD ANY WORK DONE ON ANY WIRING, NOR THE IGNITION SYSTEM, EXCEPT TUNE-UPS.

ONE MINUTE LATER, SMOKE STARTED COMING FROM UNDER THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HOOD.  WITHIN 3 MINUTES, SHE VERY QUICKLY DROVE BACK TO HER OFFICE, RAISED THE CAR'S HOOD, AND FOUND THE IGNITION WIRING ON FIRE.  SHE DUMPED WATER ON THE FIRE AND PUT IT OUT.  SHE THEN CALLED THE FIRE DEPT. TO COME AND MAKE SURE THE FIRE WAS OUT.  THE FIRE DEPT. AND POLICE BOTH SHOWED UP.  THEY INSTRUCTED HER TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO OUR AUTO REPAIR SHOP, AND NOT TO TURN ON THE IGNITION SWITCH.  WE DID AS THEY INSTRUCTED.  I CAME TO HER OFFICE AND WAITED FOR THE TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE.  OUR MECHANIC SAID THAT THERE WAS NO OUTSIDE CAUSE FOR THE WIRING TO CATCH FIRE.  NOTHING WAS TOUCHING THE WIRING, NO WIRES WERE EXPOSED, THE WIRING BUNDLE WAS NOT RUBBING UP AGAINST ANYTHING, AND THE WIRING WAS IN ITS ORIGINAL WRAPPED, BUNDLED LOOM.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER CAUSE FOR THIS FIRE EXCEPT THE IGNITION RESISTOR CAPACITOR WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE FACTORY, AND THAT IT FAILED, GOT HOT, AND BURST INTO FLAMES.  HE TOLD ME TO REPORT THIS CAR FIRE TO NHTSA AS A DEFECT IN THIS CAR'S WIRING SYSTEM.  (I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW, HAVE NEVER HAD ANY WORK DONE ON ANY WIRING, NOR THE IGNITION SYSTEM, EXCEPT TUNE-UPS.  THE LAST TUNE-UP WAS DONE ON 12/15/1999, AND THE ONLY THING DONE WAS NEW SPARK PLUGS, NEW DISTRIBUTOR CAP & ROTOR, AND NEW PCV VALVE INSTALLED.  THE WIRING HAS NEVER BEEN TOUCHED, AND HAD NO LOGICAL REASON TO BURST INTO FLAMES, EXCEPT FOR A  FACTORY DEFECT IN THE WIRING IGNITION RESISTOR CAPACITOR, AS MY MECHANIC HAS STATED, IN A LETTER TO NISSAN MOTOR CORP., P.O. BOX 191, GARDENA, CA., 90248.)  NISSAN HAS AGREED TO PAY HALF OF MY REPAIR COSTS, SINCE MY CAR'S 3-YR WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.   THEY SHOULD PAY THE WHOLE COST, BECAUSE THIS PART SHOULD'VE NEVER FAILED.  I FILED A FIRE REPORT WITH THEM, FILE NO. CA3175439.  *AK",

IT ALWAYS HAPPENS IN COLD WEATHER: FIVE (5) TIMES THE CAR HAS JUST STOPPED WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC AND COULD NOT BE STARTED BY SHUTTING OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTING: VARIOUS TIMES THE CAR DIED WHILE AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS OR STOPPED IN TRAFFIC, AND I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND CONTINUE DRIVING;  FIVE (5) TIMES I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO START THE CAR, (JUMPING THE BATTERY USED TO START THE CAR), AND VARIOUS TIMES THE CAR TAKES MULTIPLE TRYS BEFORE THE ENGINE TURNS OVER AND STARTS. I REPLACED THE BATTERY ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A MECHANIC AND UNTIL LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THAT SERIOUS AND SOMEWHAT RESOLVED.  INTERMITTENLY THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WOULD GO OFF AND THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER COME BACK BUT AFTER LAST NIGHT I REALIZE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CAR JUST STOPING IN TRAFFIC WERE VERY SERIOUS.  MY CAR WAS RUNNING AND I WAS DRIVING AND THREE TIMES IT JUST STOPPED.  MY LIGHTS WERE STILL ON AND AFTER JUMPING THE BATTERY THE CAR STARTED BUT WHILE DRIVING HOME, IT APPEARED THAT AS I SLOWED OR HIT THE BRAKES, THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT BUT THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING AND UPON ACCELERATION, THE DASH WOULD RELIGHT BUT THEN THE CAR JUST STOPPED UPON BRAKING AT A LIGHT AND COULD NOT BE STARTED.  IT IS NOW NOT STARTING AT ALL AND I'M WORRIED THAT THERE ARE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM..  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST NISSAN SENTRA THAT I HAVE HAD THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH, A 1982 NISSAN SENTRA THAT I HAD, PLAGUED ME WITH THIS SORT OF STARTING PROBLEMS AND AFTER REPLACING BATTERIES/ALTERNATORS/STARTERS AND A HOST OF OTHER COMPONENETS, AFTER BEING TOWED MULTIPLE TIMES TO BAY ROYAL NISSAN I PURCHASED THE 1992 SENTRA",
