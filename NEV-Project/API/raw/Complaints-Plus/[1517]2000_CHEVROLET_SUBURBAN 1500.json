AS FAR AS I CAN SEE, THERE IS NO SECONDARY SAFETY FEATURE THAT CHEVY HAS PROVIDED TO SECURE THIS SPARE TIRE IN CASE THIS CABLE BREAKS.

ONCE I PULLED IN TO THE BAY OF THE STORE, UPON THE 2ND OR 3RD TIME I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE PEDAL WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR, NO BRAKES! LUCKILY THERE WAS LITTLE MOTION ON THE SUBURBAN, MOVING IT TO PARK STOPPED THE MOTION. NOT AT ANY TIME DID ANY ABS OR BRAKE LIGHTS COME ON THE DASH TO ALERT ME OF ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, NOR ANY INDICATIONS OF SPONGY BRAKES. JUST SUDDEN AND COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. THE MECHANICS AT BIG O TIRES ALERTED ME OF A LEAK COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE MIDDLE AREA OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE SUBURBAN FROM THE FRAME. THEY LIFTED UP THE SUBURBAN AND PROCEEDED TO INSPECT. THEY INFORMED ME THAT ALL THE BRAKE LINES WHERE RUSTED AND ROTTED OUT AND THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE BRAKE LINES HAD BURST OR BROKEN, CAUSING THE BRAKE FAILURE.    I STARTED TO RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT BOTH GMC & NHTSA ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND NO RECALLS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO DATE. IN FACT FROM THE INFORMATION THAT I CAN GATHER ONLINE IS THAT THE NHTSA HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH COMPLAINTS IN REGARDS TO THIS PROBLEM AND  GMC REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL, CLAIMING THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO ME AT VERY LOW SPEED IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT. WHAT IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHILE DRIVING AND APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION? I CAN THINK OF A MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHERE THIS COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT TO MUCH WORSE CIRCUMSTANCES. BRAKES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SAFETY MECHANISM ON ANY VEHICLE.

BEING IN THE FAST LANE AND TRAVELING AT 55 MPH WITH A CONCRETE DIVIDER WALL AND NO SHOULDER TO MY LEFT I IMMEDIATELY DOWNSHIFTED WHILE HOLDING THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR AND CUT THE WHEEL HARD TO HEAD ACROSS LANES OF TRAFFIC.  THE REAR END FISHTAILED OUT TOWARDS THE DRIVERS SIDE BARELY MISSING THE LINE OF TRAFFIC IN THE FAST LANE.

I BARELY GOT AROUND THEM AND FISHTAILED THE BACKEND THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN THE SUBURBAN AS IT GRAZED THE GUARDRAIL. AT THIS POINT THE BRAKES WERE STILL OUT, PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, AND I TRAVELED THROUGH A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION (RT 24 AND RT 95) STILL ROLLING AT APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH.
