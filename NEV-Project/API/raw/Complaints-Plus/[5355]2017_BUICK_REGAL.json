Hello good evening from Miami my name is [XXX] I enjoy my 2017 Buick Regal GS love my car but I've been back and forth with the service department at both the main Buick dealer about outside smells coming inside the car at all times especially when there's any car in front of my vehicle all smells comes into the car A/C system even when it shut off and the air recirculation button always no. My main concern I Am getting all type of smells from the outside especially for fumes from other vehicle, diesel, toxic, nature. the smells of fumes hit my face so bad that gets me lightheaded while I'm driving the vehicle also my passengers complains several times about the smells. I got the car back today from Lorenzo Buick dealer in Miami the service advisor a notify me that there's nothing they can do that Engineering has the car vents always open 20% form factory specifications. The service advisor told me to find somewhere else to get the car computer reprogrammed to keep it always shut. My complaint is that I would like to have the car\u00a0air recirculation button always shut close 100% not 20% for safety reasons for my health and allergy outside smells there should be a recall to get this matter fixed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",
