I TRIED WITH THEM A FEW YEARS AGO BUT AGAIN NO RESPONSE.     WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THE COMMON COURTESY OF A CALLBACK OR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS MAKING AN APPOINTMENT?

MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY FELT PAIN IN HER ENTIRE BODY AND COULDN'T MOVE.  POLICE AND PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED AND SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.  UPON MEDICAL EXAMINATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE HAD A THORACIC BURST FRACTURE AT T12 AND A T11 COMPRESSION FRACTURE, FRACTURE TO R LAMINA AND PARS OF T12 AS WELL. SHE HAD A RIB FRACTURE AND PULMONARY CONTUSION.  THESE WERE LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.  SHE NEEDED TO HAVE IMMEDIATE SPINAL FUSION SURGERY FOR THE T10-L2 AREA OF HER SPINE.  WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY AND PROVIDED DOCUMENTS THROUGH FAXES AND EMAIL AND EACH TIME THEY SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE OUR DOCUMENTS. THEY CONSISTENTLY SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE OUR DOCUMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE FAX CONFIRMATION AND EMAIL SHOWING THAT DOCUMENTS WERE SENT SUCCESSFULLY TO AMERICAN HONDA.

FROM SPEAKING TO PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE BEEN REBUILDING HONDA TRANSMISSIONS FOR YEARS, IT IS A PROBLEM WITH MATERIALS FLAKING OFF THE TORQUE CONVERTER AND THE CLUTCH CLOGGING THINGS UP.  I DRIVE AT 2001 HONDA CIVIC AND THE P0740 ERROR CODE HAS COME UP, BUT THE CAR IS STILL RUNNING FINE, BUT UNTIL I GET THE TRANSMISSION SUPPOSEDLY REPAIRED I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PASS AIRCARE EVEN THOUGH MY EMISSIONS ARE PERFECTLY ABOVE AVERAGE.  INCIDENTS VARY FROM TOTAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGH, STALLS, TO ACCIDENTS.  IF YOU JUST GOOGLE SEARCH 2001-2003 HONDA CIVIC TRANSMISSION YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF.  I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WEAR AND TEAR OVER-TIME DOES HAPPEN, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE AND FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD BEAR SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUILDING A FAULTY TRANSMISSION. *TR",

MY VIN APPARENTLY WAS A FEW NUMBERS OFF. I WOULD THINK THAT IF I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, HONDA WOULD FIX MY SWITCH EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T WITHIN THE RECALLED VIN RANGE. MY SECOND COMPLAINT IS THAT AFTER HAVING REPLACED THE RECALLED PART, THE SRS INDICATOR LIGHT IS STILL ON. THIS DEALERSHIP ALLOWED ME TO DRIVE AWAY IN MY UNSAFE CAR, WHICH WILL NOT PASS INSPECTION DUE TO THE SAFETY ISSUE. THE FINAL ISSUE IS THAT I WAS PROMISED THE CAR AT 1 O'CLOCK, AND I DIDN'T GET A CALL THAT IT WAS FINISHED UNTIL ALMOST 2 O'CLOCK, AND AT THAT TIME I HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO FIND SOMEONE AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO PICK UP MY CHILD FROM SCHOOL.

WE TOOK IT IN TO A LOCAL TRANSMISSION COMPANY WHO SERVICED (CHANGED FLUID) AND TESTED IT TELLING US THAT THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO \"SLIP.\" SO NOW, MY LOVELY BRIDE TELLS ME YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS GETTING REALLY BAD AND SHE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING BACK FROM WORK. I DROVE IT TO WORK MYSELF AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP. THEY WERE SO NOT INTERESTED IN OUR DILEMMA BUT SAID THAT WE COULD BRING IT IN AND THEY WOULD CHECK IT OUT. NOT GETTING THE WARM FUZZIES FROM THEM, WE MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH OUR LOCAL XXXXX SERVICE CENTER. EVERYONE AT XXXXX WAS POLITE, UNDERSTANDING AND AWARE OF THE \"INFAMOUS CRAPPY HONDA TRANSMISSION\" ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY, ON THE DRIVE THERE, THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY FAILED ON THE FREEWAY AND WE MANAGED TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD AND CALLED AAMCO.

THE FAILURE EFFECTS THE 3RD AND 4TH GEARS.  WHEN ACCELERATING, THE ENGINE WILL REV AND THERE IS NO INCREASE IN SPEED WHATSOEVER.  MY CAR IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT.  IT WAS THE ONLY OPTION BESIDES COMPLETELY REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAD THE ELD UNIT REPLACED BECAUSE ONE MECHANIC THOUGHT IT MAY HELP, HOWEVER IT DID NOTHING.  MY \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT HAD ONLY BEEN ON FOR ONE WEEK PRIOR TO GETTING A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DONE ON MY CAR TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOONER, HAD I NOT BEEN AWAY FROM HOME.  MY SAFETY CONCERN COMES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC.  WITHOUT 3RD OR 4TH GEAR, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE CAR UP TO SAFE SPEED TO MERGE IN WITH CARS GOING 60-70 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY.

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CURRENT WITH THE MAINTENANCE AND THE TRANSMISSION JUST GAVE WAY ALL OF A SUDDEN.  I WAS THEN ADVISED THAT 2001 CIVIC HAVE A LOT OF TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BUT A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED.

HE SAID THAT I AM IN NEED OF A NEW TRANSMISSION.  AFTER READING SOME INFORMATION ONLINE, IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A RATHER COMMON ISSUE FOR 2001 HONDA CIVICS.  I CONTACTED HONDA OF AMERICA IN CA THIS MORNING TO SEE IF THERE HAVE EVER BEEN ANY SAFETY RECALLS FOR MY CAR.  I WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY RECALLS AND THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR SINCE MY CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  I NOW HAVE TO PAY $3,000 TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION ON MY VEHICLE.

IT WAS VERY BAD BECAUSE THE SLIPS HAPPENED A LOT WHILE I WAS TURNING OUT OF A DRIVE WAY AND IT WOULD STOP ME IN THE MIDDLE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE! DURING THAT TIME, I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 400 OTHER 01 HONDA OWNERS THAT HAVE THE SAME TRANSMISSION FAILURE AND THAT THE TYPICAL COST FOR REPAIR WOULD BE A COUPLE OF THOUSANDS.  I WAS HOPING THAT MY PROBLEM IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE I TOOK GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, WITH REGULAR OIL CHANGE EVERY 3000 MILES, CHANGED WATER PUMP AND TIMING BELT NOT TOO LONG AGO TOO.  I WANTED TO SEEK OTHER OPTIONS SO I WENT AND GOT MY TRANSMISSION FLUID, SPARK PLUGS AND EVEN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER CHANGED BUT NOW I KNOW ITS PROBABLY THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE ALL ALONG.

AS SUCH, THEY RECOMMENDED AN ENTIRELY NEW TRANSMISSION.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR INFORMED ME THAT THIS REPLACEMENT WOULD COST ROUGHLY $3,000, AND I HAD TO WAIT SEVERAL WEEKS FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION TO ARRIVE.  IN THAT TIME, I GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM AN INDEPENDENT, HIGHLY REPUTABLE HONDA MECHANIC.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, AND THAT THE TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH WAS RUINED AND HAD BURNED UP THE FLUID.  HE FURTHER INFORMED ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN HONDA TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EARLY 2000'S, ESPECIALLY FROM 2001 CIVICS.    MY TRANSMISSION WAS EVENTUALLY REPLACED, AT A COST OF $1467.48.  AFTER DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH, I'VE DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM HONDA CIVIC OWNERS FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.  INDEED, TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS HAVE BEEN OUT FOR YEARS REGARDING THIS ISSUE.

I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE (INCLUDING A HONDA DEALERSHIP AND A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP) LOOK AT THE CAR TO FIND THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE, AND I ASKED EACH TECHNICIAN TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE TRANSMISSION, BUT EVERY REPORT TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR.  THE MOST RECENT CHECK ON MY CAR WAS PERFORMED A WEEK AGO (4/28/09).  THEN, A WEEK LATER, MY TRANSMISSION FAILED.  WHILE THERE WERE NO ACCIDENTS, THERE EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN, AS I HAD JUST BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY, AND SUDDENLY MY CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO THIRD GEAR. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT A HIGHER SPEED OR IN A HIGHER GEAR, AND I DON'T WANT TO.  I DROVE IT STRAIGHT TO A DEALERSHIP AND DISCOVERED THAT MY TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE ENTIRELY REPLACED.  I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN HAVING A HONDA CIVIC WITH A TRANSMISSION THAT FAILED MUCH TOO EARLY (AND AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF CONSCIENTIOUS UPKEEP) BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF COMPLAINTS TO BE FOUND ON VARIOUS WEBSITES.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM -- I COULD EASILY HAVE CRASHED OR BEEN REAR-ENDED BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. *TR",

HE FIXED THE PART AND EXPLAINED TO US THAT THE ORIGINAL SAFETY RECALL PROBLEM HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED DURING OUR SUPPOSED RECALL SERVICING WITH HONDA. HE SAID IN THE RECALL SERVICING, A HEADLIGHT SWITCH WIRE THAT WAS TOO SMALL OF A GAUGE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REPLACED BY A MUCH HEAVIER GAUGE WIRE. OUR CAR STILL HAD THE ORIGINAL SMALL GAUGE FACTORY WIRE INSTALLED WHICH NOT ONLY WAS MELTED THROUGH BUT HAD ALSO CAUSED THE LIGHT SWITCH TO MELT. HE REPLACED ALL PARTS FOR A CHARGE OF $117.95 WHICH WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN WHAT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WOULD HAVE CHARGED US. HE GAVE US OUR MELTED PARTS AS EVIDENCE TO PRESENT TO THE HONDA CORPORATION. HE INFORMED US THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WITH CARS WHO HAVE NEVER HAD THE SAFETY RECALL SERVICING AT ALL. WE HAVE REPORTED ALL THIS BACK TO THE HONDA CORPORATION BUT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE GIVEN US A CASE NUMBER, THEY HAVE FAILED TO HELP US AT ALL.

ALSO, THE RIGHT WINDOW MOTOR IS BURNED OUT (SINCE 2007), IT ALMOST STALLS WHEN IN REVERSE (SINCE 2005), HAVE NOTICED A LAG IN ACCELERATION IN LOWER GEARS (60K), ALSO ABRUPT DOWNSHIFTING (SOMETIMES) & IT MAKES AN ODD HUMMING SEEMING TO COME FROM REAR OF VEHICLE WHEN ACCELERATING (THIS LAST WEEK).

I UNDERSTAND IT IS VERY  HIGH IN MILES, BUT I ALSO BELIEVED THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF \"HONDAS ARE MADE TO LAST\".  A WEEK PRIOR TO WHEN THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY FAILED, I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND IT STARTED SLOWING DOWN AND IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN NEUTRAL.  I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE AND TURNED OFF MY VEHICLE AND RESTARTED THE CAR AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  A COUPLE DAYS LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND IT FELT LIKE MY CAR WAS JERKING TRYING TO SWITCH GEARS.  I FOUND IT VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHEN MY TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAD TURN INTO A SMALL RESIDENTIAL STREET FROM A BUSY STREET.  HAD I NOT TURN AND STAYED ON THE BUSY, TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED, I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT ALONG WITH OTHER CARS BEHIND ME.    AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH I ALSO FOUND THAT THIS WAS VERY COMMON FOR EARLY 2000 HONDAS AND ESPECIALLY  FOR 2001 HONDAS.  IN RESEARCHING I ALSO FOUND THE NHSTA CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION AND CONCLUDED IT WAS NOT DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO RESORT TO A RECALL.     I UNDERSTAND THAT INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE VIGOROUSLY AND THOROUGHLY, HOWEVER I FEEL DIFFERENT BEING THAT I WAS IN THE SITUATION.  IN MY OPINION, IF IT THIS COMMON AND MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY IT, SOMETHING SHOULD AT LEAST BE DONE.  I AM A STUDENT AND JUST PAYING FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION IS SO COSTLY AND I FIND IT VERY HAZARDOUS AND PROBLEMATIC WHEN MY CAR STOPS ABRUPTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.    I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF THERE WAS A SECOND LOOK AT THIS SITUATION.      THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.   *TR",

THEREFORE, I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AS I HAD SEEN ADVISED ON THE BOARD AND THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL THE CASES WERE HANDLED INDIVIDUALLY AND THAT  IT HAD TO BE CHECKED AT THE HONDA DEALER. THEY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER, AND SO I TOOK MY CAR TO THE GOODSON HONDA DEALERSHIP IN HOUSTON. THE SERVICE MANGER RAN DIAGNOSTICS FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS, AND SAID, \"EVERYTHING IS OK. THE NOISE THAT YOU HEAR COMING FROM THE CAR IS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.' SO I TOOK HIS WORD FOR IT.    THEN THREE DAYS LATER WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, MY TRANSMISSION FAILED. IT ALMOST KILLED ME AND MY MOTHER. THE SITUATION COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN FATAL.      I TOWED MY CAR TO MY HOUSE AND CALLED HONDA AMERICA AGAIN AND REPORTED MY TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I TOWED MY CAR TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP UNDER THE RECOMMENDATION OF HONDA AMERICA AND HAD THEM CHECK THE CAR.  THEY SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS OUT.

THERE WAS SLIPPAGE 3 YEARS AGO AND I WAS THANKFUL THAT WE WERE MOVING TO FL SINCE THERE ARE FEW MAJOR HILLS THERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP SAVE MY TRANSMISSION. WE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO STAY IN FLORIDA DUE TO MY HEALTH FAILING AND I NEEDED TO BE NEARER TO FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF MY HEALTH ISSUES. UPON MOVING BACK TO PA ABOUT 3,000 MILE LATER MY TRANSMISSION FAILED COMPLETELY. I AM PRESENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF SPEAKING WITH HONDA OF AMERICA SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR BASED ON REPUTATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WITH GENERAL MAINTENANCE THAT YOU CAN GET 200-400,000 MILE IT MAINTAINED.   THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT GOOD WILL, I AM TALKING ABOUT SPENDING  OVER 15,000 FOR A NEW CAR THAT GOT ME 6 YEARS AND WHAM. NOTHING. I HAVE ALWAYS SPENT 1,000 ON A USED CAR AND ALWAYS GOTTEN MORE THAN A YEAR OUT OF THAT  IT WOULD HAVE PAID ME TO BUY 6 USED CARS AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF I WOULD STILL HAVE MONEY IN MY POCKET AT THIS POINT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT POSSIBLY SPENDING A BUNCH TO GET THIS ONE FIXED!  I AM DISABLED AND NOT IN THE POSITION TO SPEND ANYTHING ON THIS CAR.. I HAVE PUT ENOUGH INTO IT OVER THE YEARS TO GUARANTEE THAT I SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT A MAJOR REPAIR AT THIS POINT!  I HAVE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF 01 HONDA CIVIC OWNERS AND NO ONE IS HAPPY WITH THIS CAR I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SAME TRANSMISSION IS IN THE CIVIC THAT IS IN THE ACCORD THEY ADMIT THE RECALL ON THE ACCORD BUT NOT THE CIVIC I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND FIND THAT 98-03 ACCORDS ARE ROTTEN ON TRANSMISSION FAILURE AND 01 -02 CIVICS ARE RIGHT THERE WITH THEM.

WE ACCEPTED THAT AS TRUTH SINCE IT WAS IN THE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH THE CAR.  OF COURSE, NOW THE PERSON I TALKED TO AT HONDA SAYS \"WELL IT SHOULD BE CHANGED EVERY 30,000 MILES\".  WE TOOK WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE MANUAL ON PAGE 196 AS WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.

AFTER MUCH RESEARCH IT SEEMS OR TWO WAS NOT A FLUKE.  THE INTERNET IS IS LOADED WITH COMPLAINTS FROM OWNERS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND DEALERS FLEECING THE PUBLIC WITH REPAIRS. BASICALLY IF YOUR DRIVING AROUND WITH THE LIGHT ON YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOUR AIR BAGS WILL DEPLOY. IF YOU TRY TO GET IT FIXED, IT'S A HUGE BILL. HOW CAN HONDA AND THE GOVERNMENT BLATANTLEY DISREGARD THIS SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT AND PASS THE RESPONSIBILITY ONTO THE CONSUMER? THIS IS CRAZY. I RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT GOOGLE FOR\" HONDA SRS LIGHT\" AND REVIEW THE CHATTER. THEN LOOK AT ALL THE WORK AROUND FOLKS ARE USING MEANWHILE DISREGARDING SAFETY OF PASSENGERS. HONDA NEEDS TO FIX THIS OBVIOUS PROBLEM REGARDING THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE DRIVING THEIR PRODUCTS.     *NM",

ANOTHER FACT IS WHEN THE WHEEL (AND TIRE) HIT ON A HOLE THE PLASTIC BEARING DOESN'T \"RESIST\" THE IMPACT (AS A METAL BALL BEARING CAN DO). THIS RESULT IN FAST WEAR AND DEFORMATION TO THE PART. THIS PLASTIC BEARING, (THAT YOU CAN EASILY BEND WITH YOUR HANDS AND ISN'T WELL ENGINEERED) CAN'T SUPPORT A 2500 POUNDS CAR HITTING A HOLE AT 60 MPH  (120 MPH SPEED LIMIT; AS SAFETY FACTOR).    WHEN THE BEARING FAILS THE WHEELS CAN'T BE TURNED WELL AND SOME TIMES THE SPRING SEATS HIT (OR SCUFF) THE STRUT TOWER RESULTING IN A NON WELL STEERING AT ALL. EVEN THIS CAUSES DAMAGE TO OTHER STEERING AND SUSPENSION PARTS.    THIS RESULT IN SOME PROBLEMS THAT ARE COMMON SUBJECTS IN MANY 2001 CIVICS AS YOU CAN SEE IN CAR FORUMS: THE STEERING WHEEL DOESN'T RETURN TO ITS CENTER POSITION AFTER TURNING IN ANY DIRECTION, WHEEL MISALIGNMENT, VIBRATIONS IN THE STEERING WHEEL, PARTS AND TIRES UNUSUAL WEAR, SOUNDS AND CLICKS ON THE STEERING AND SUSPENSION COMPONENTS, AND OTHERS.    IS KNOWN MISALIGNED VEHICLES, WORN STEERING AND SUSPENSION COMPONENTS, VIBRATIONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL, AFFECTS THE VEHICLE DRIVABILITY AND CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND INJURIES. THE VIBRATIONS AND THE EXCESS OF FORCE THAT HAVE TO BE APPLIED TO THE STEERING WHEEL, AS ON OTHER MECHANICAL PARTS, CAN CAUSE HEALTH DISEASES.    AS MENTIONED, HONDA CORRECT THIS DEFECT ON THE LATER MODELS FROM 2002 REPLACING THE PLASTIC BEARING WITH A METAL BALL BEARING AND DOING SOME CHANGES TO THE UPPER SPRING SEATS AND OTHER COMPONENTS.  *JB",

BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUED FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.  I THOUGHT MY PROBLEMS WERE OVER UNTIL SEPTEMBER 11, 2003 WHEN MY CAR STARTED RACING FOR NO REASON.  THEN I TRIED TO TURN INTO MCDONALDS AND MY CAR WOULDN'T MOVE.  SO MY FRIEND AND A STRANGE PUSHED MY CAR INTO THE PARKING LOT. THEN I CALLED AAA TO TOW MY CAR TO MY APARTMENT BUILDING.  THE NEXT MORNING I TOWED MY CAR TO WEST BROAD HONDA.  LATER THAT MORNING A REPRESENTATIVE FOR WEST BROAD HONDA STATED MY TRANSMISSION NEED TO BE REPLACED.  (MY CAR ONLY HAD 65,000 MILES).  *NM",

WE PURCHASED A HONDA BECAUSE WE DESIRED A CAR THAT WAS DEPENDABLE AND ONE THAT WOULD BE USED FOR MY FIANCS COMMUTE AND FOR DRIVING LONG DISTANCES. IN AUGUST OF 2002, THE CAR OVERHEATED ON A JOURNEY FROM ONEONTA, NY, TO PHOENIXVILLE, PA.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE HONDA OF ITHACA DEALERSHIP.  AT THIS POINT, THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BEING UNDER A YEAR AFTER TIME OF PURCHASE WITH 18,717 MILES.  HONDA OF ITHACA, NEW YORK DETERMINED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE THERMOSTAT.  DESPITE THE OBVIOUS INCONVENIENCE THAT THIS BREAKDOWN CAUSED, WE WERE HAPPY THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED WHILE THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY. IN DECEMBER 2003 ON A TRIP FROM PHOENIXVILLE, PA TO HOLMDEL, NJ THE CAR AGAIN OVERHEATED.  A LOCAL MECHANIC DETERMINED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE THERMOSTAT.  NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, THE THERMOSTAT WAS REPLACED AT A COST TO US OF $106.43.  ON FEBRUARY-4-2004 THE PROBLEM MANIFESTED ITSELF ONCE AGAIN.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO ROBERTS AUTO MALL.  THE MECHANIC GUESSED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS AIR IN THE SYSTEM.  WE WERE CHARGED $63.49 FOR DIAGNOSTICS. ON MARCH 10TH, THE CAR AGAIN OVERHEATED.  WE ARE NOW USING ONE VEHICLE WHILE OUR HONDA CIVIC SITS OUTSIDE UNUSED.  I AM UNSURE HOW TO PROCEED SINCE EVERY MECHANIC HAS SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM. OUR COMPLAINT CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS SUCH:  THIS PROBLEM IS INTRINSIC TO THE CAR.  IT APPEARED WHILE THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND HAS NEVER BEEN PROPERLY CORRECTED.  IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF ABUSE OR DAMAGE TO THE CAR BUT IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  WE HAVE INCURRED MONETARY LOSS DUE TO  REPEATED TOWING AND REPAIRS MADE AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE WARRANTY.  OTHER THAN THESE EXPENSES, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMA OF BEING STRANDED ON HIGHWAYS AT NIGHT, AND BEING AT A LOSS OF OUR VEHICLE WHEN ONE IS NEEDED TO COMMUTE TO WORK.*AK  UPDATED 07/27/2012  *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

HAS BEEN TO VANDERGRIFF HONDA 3 SEPARATE TIMES.  THE FIRST TIME THEY REPLACED THE WINDSHIELD.  THE SECOND TIME THEY SAID THEY COULD NEVER HEAR THE NOISE SO COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. THE THIRD TIME THEY HAD THE CAR FOR 3 DAYS AND STILL DID NOTHING EXCEPT SAID THEY THOUGHT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE BACK BRAKES.  SO THEY FIXED THEM.  THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES.  TWO WEEKS AGO TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER PURCHASED FROM.  HE RODE IN THE CAR WITH ME FOR AT LEAST 50 MILES.  NEVER HEARD THE NOISE.  I LEFT THE CAR.  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 15 DAYS AND DID NOTHING.  ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE REPORT AND THE SERVICE ADVISOR THEY REPRODUCED THE NOISE, BUT COULD NOT FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.  THE COPY OF THE SERVICE REPORT THAT I RECEIVED WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, SHOWS 9 HOURS TIME SPENT ON VEHICLE - DRIVING, TAPING, ETC.  NOT A LOT OF TIME SPENT ON IT IN 15 DAYS.  I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA CASEWORKER AGAIN TODAY.  WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR YESTERDAY, AS SOON AS I GOT ON THE HIGHWAY THE NOISE STARTED.  AFTER 10 MINUTES OF CONTINUAL WHISTLING I CALLED BACK THE SERVICE ADVISOR I HAD JUST LEFT AND HE HEARD THE NOISE.  MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER WERE ALSO IN THE CAR WITH ME.  THE NOISE CONTINUED ALL THE WAY HOME.  THE DEALER IS 1 HOUR FROM MY HOME.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON THAT I DID NOT TAKE IT TO THEM BEFORE.  BUT WHEN VANDERGRIFF COULDN'T FIX IT, I WROTE A LETTER TO AMERICAN HONDA (9/10/02).  FINALLY GOT A RESPONSE BACK FROM THEM THE END OF OCTOBER.  AFTER WHICH WE AGREED THAT I WOULD TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER I PURCHASED FROM.  I HAVE ASKED AM. HONDA WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THE RESPONSE IS NOTHING.

THE CAR HAS 23,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS GONE THROUGH 3 SETS OF BRAKES.  THE CAR COMPLETELY DIED ON TWO OCCASIONS, BOTH NEEDING BATTERY TO BE BOOSTED.  THEN ALL OF THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WERE FLASHING CRAZY. ON ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS, IT DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HONDA, AFTER THEY ASSURED ME THAT MY CAR WAS FINE.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH HONDA.  THEY FAIL TO FIND ANY OF THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT ARE CONTINUING.  THE CAR MAKES ALL KIND OF RATTLING AND CLICKING NOISES WHEN DRIVING, HONDA FINDS NOTHING.  THE WINDOWS/WINDSHIELD FOG UP, DEFROSTER DOES NOT WORK WELL, HONDA FINDS NOTHING.  ALL FOUR TIRES ARE LEAKING, HONDA AT FIRST FIND NOTHING WRONG, NOW SAY I HAVE TO REPLACE TIRES.  THE DRIVER'S SEAT IS LOOSE AND ROCKING, HONDA REPLACED SEAT TRACK TWICE, PROBLEM CONTINUES, TOOK CAR IN AGAIN FOR SEAT, HONDA FINDS NOTHING WRONG.  SEAT ROCKING GETS WORSE, MAKING LOAD NOISE WHEN DRIVING, AFRAID FOR SAFETY.  NOW THE CAR IS GETTING WORSE, CAR BRAKES WITHOUT PUTTING FOOT ON BRAKE, CAR IS SLUGGISH, DRIVING FUNNY.  I THINK THIS IS THE TRANSMISSION THAT IS GOING TO GO BAD.   IT STALLS TO START VERY OFTEN, THEN COMPLETELY FAILED TWICE, NEEDING BOOST.  IM VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AT THIS POINT.  I EVEN REACHED OUT TO HONDA CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA, THEY DID NOT HELP AT ALL, IN FACT THEY WERE RUDE AND EVEN THREATENED ME, WHILE I HAD THE RENTAL, TO REPORT THE RENTAL STOLEN BECAUSE I ASKED IF I COULD HOLD THE RENTAL UNTIL HONDA FIXED MY CAR (ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CAR HAD DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HONDA, AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MY CAR WAS DENTED, TWICE, WHILE BEING \"FIXED\" BY HONDA THAT DAY AS WELL)  I AM COMPLETELY DISGUSTED WITH THE CAR AND THE SERVICE IVE GOTTEN.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS I DIDN'T LIST HERE, TOO MANY TO LIST.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP IN THIS MATTER, THANK YOU.   *NLM",
