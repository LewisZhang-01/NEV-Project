        "summary": "DT:  CONSUMER STATES THAT THE HOLDING TANK IS VENTED INTO BATHROOM VANITY INSIDE COACH MOTOR HOME. THIS IS CAUSING DANGEROUS ODORS FROM HOLDING TANK. CONSUMER SAYS THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN VENTED OUTSIDE OF THE COACH. THE ODORS ARE STRONGER WHEN DRIVING THAN WHEN PARKING. THIS IS A SICKENING SMELL AND CAUSES FAMILY MEMBERS TO BECOME ILL. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HEALTH HAZARD. ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO THE ODOR WAS SO BAD THAT FLEETWOOD TOLD CONSUMER  TO PUT ICE CUBES AND BAKING SODA INTO THE TOILET. CONSUMER SAYS THAT WAS A TEMPORARY FIX. THE MANUFACTURER HAS BEEN CONTACTED, AND FLEETWOOD DEALERSHIP  TOLD THE CONSUMER THAT A SUPERVISOR WOULD CALL HIM BACK. THIS WAS ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO AND STILL NO CONTACT FROM FLEETWOOD. THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT THIS  HAPPENED. IT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE SINCE DECEMBER OF 2004. THE COACH IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY , AND THE DEALERSHIP STILL HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM. CONSUMER IS UNABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT.  THE SERVICE IS VERY POOR. THE CONSUMER  TRIED THREE DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT.  THE DEALERS  REFERRED THE CONSUMER TO OTHER DEALERS.*AK",
