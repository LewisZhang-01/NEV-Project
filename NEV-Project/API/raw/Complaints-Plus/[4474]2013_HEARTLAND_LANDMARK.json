WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THAT THE BENT SHOCK ABSORBER RESULTING FROM LACK OF RETENTION TO THE VEHICLE FRAME WAS ON THE REAR AXLE AND THE FORWARD MOTION DID NOT CAUSE IT TO DESTROY THE TIRE. THE FRONT AXLE SHOCK ABSORBER WAS ALSO MISSING ITS RETENTION NUT BUT DID NOT BEND . IF THIS HAD HAPPENED THE MOTION WOULD HAVE CAUSED EXPLOSIVE TIRE FAILURE. THIS IS THE LAST IN A SERIES OF QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES FOR THIS VEHICLE. INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE RETENTION NUTS TO THE FRAME WERE NOT INSTALLED AND THE MOTION OF THE VEHICLES CAUSED IMPACTS OF THE FREE UPPER END OF THE SHOCK ABSORBER WITH THE VEHICLE FRAME. THE BENT END WAS RUBBING ON THE TIRE WALL.  PHOTOGRAPHS ARE AVAILABLE.  *TR",
