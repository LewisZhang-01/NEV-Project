Again, this was rare, but concerning. This became somewhat more common in the months that followed and is now a common annoyance on every drive.   Because of personal circumstances, as well as the Coronavirus Pandemic, we have not driven this vehicle much over the past couple of years, and we have not taken the car in for service. It has not yet been inspected by any other entity other than myself.  The alarms happen whether the passenger seat is occupied or not. I have read on the GM-Volt online forum that this is likely caused by a defective passenger detection pad in the passenger seat, but I have personally checked the seat wiring harness and connector, and they appear to be nominal.  Obviously, having an inoperative passenger airbag system is a significant safety concern.   We ordered the car, and it was delivered new in December, 2013. There has never been a spill, leak, or any damage to any of the seats or airbag system of this vehicle.  We intend to report the problem to our dealer, \"Bob Steele Chevrolet\" in Cocoa, FL within the next week.  Our car is readily available for inspection at any time.",

I was told \u201coh this happens a lot with the earlier Volts\u201d and was quoted $1100+ to fix the issue. I took it to another shop and was quoted a similar amount, around $1000+ with parts and labor. The safety of myself and any passenger of mine is at risk indefinitely because of this issue. I cannot have any passengers sit in the front passenger seat because the airbag will toggle on/off even when there is an adult sitting in the sit and not moving around. The problem was not reproduced, but was confirmed by a mechanic at Chevrolet in Tallahassee. The only thing that mechanics tell me is that \u201cthis is a common issue\u201d and upon looking into this issue online, there are many people having the same issue. I\u2019ve done nothing that would have damaged this airbag sensor so I do not understand why it is malfunctioning, and why I\u2019m supposed to pay over $1000 for an issue that should not exist in the first place?  If the passenger airbag is having issues, what if my drivers seat airbag has an issue that I\u2019m unaware of? I can honestly say that I am not 100% confident that my airbag will deploy if I get into an accident. When driving my car I am constantly afraid for myself and for my passengers. I cannot afford to pay $1000 for an issue that doesn\u2019t make sense. My mechanic could not explain why this happens, just that it is common with my vehicle",

As suggested, I made an appointment to perform this service with a local Chevrolet where I live and took my Volt there. However, they told me that this service is covered only as part of GM\u2019s \u201cCustomer Satisfaction Program\u201d and since this vehicle has a salvage title, they would have to charge me (>$150) for this service. For your information, when I bought this Volt, it only needed some relatively minor body work and there are no mechanical of safety issues associated with it.       Furthermore, my OnStar Diagnostic Report warns me that this vehicle should seek service under GM Recall #N172130462 due to \"Loss of Propulsion Due to Low Cell Voltage.\"  So it seems to me that that this isn\u2019t just a matter of customer satisfaction, but rather a serious safety issue if I should suddenly lose propulsion while driving down the road.       However, after writing a letter to GM and having several conversations with their Customer Care Department over the last year, they refused to perform this service at no charge to me as promised in their June 2019 letter. GM should do the right thing here and fix this problem.",

IN JERSEY CITY, NJ SO WE LEFT DIRECTLY FROM THE DEALERSHIP IN THE BRAND NEW VOLT, 7 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 P.M. THE CAR ALARMED WITH TWO MESSAGES: 1. ENGINE NOT AVAILABLE AND 2. PROPULSION POWER REDUCED. THE ALARMS/ENGINE FAILURE CAME AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIME---WHILE ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE AND NO AVAILABLE SHOULDER.  WITH SEMI-TRUCKS BEARING DOWN ON US, WE LUCKILY MADE IT TO A CONSTRUCTION PULL OFF AREA AND CALLED ON STAR.  ON STAR INFORMED US THE TURNPIKE IS A RESTRICTED ZONE SO THEY COULD NOT SEND ANYONE, THEY WERE HELPFUL AND GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE TURNPIKE AUTHORITY WHICH SENT A TOW TRUCK.  WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH ON STAR MY PARTNER CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE GOT THE CAR.  THEY WERE HELPFUL AND CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WOULD BE TOWED?MALOUF CHEVROLET. AFTER WAITING OVER 30 MIN FOR A TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE, ALL THE WHILE FEARING I WAS GOING TO BE MOWED DOWN BY A SEMI-TRUCK ON THE SHOULDER, THE BRAND NEW VOLT, MY PARTNER AND I WERE OFF THE TURNPIKE. UPON ARRIVAL TO MALOUF WE WERE GREETED BY A MEMBER OF THEIR SERVICE TEAM, HE ASKED ME HOW MANY MILES WERE ON THE CAR.  I SAID?66?, HE ASKED ?6600?, I RESPONDED ?NO! 66, THE CAR ONLY RAN FOR A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AFTER DELIVERY!?  WE NOW HAVE A LOANER FROM MALOUF AND HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT CAUSED THIS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE BRAND NEW CHEVROLET VOLT.   *TR",
