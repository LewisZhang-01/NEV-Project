ST 225/75 R15 TIRES LOAD RANGE D WITH 65 PSI ARE ONLY RATED FOR 2540# EACH PUTTING MAXIMUM WEIGHT ON THE 2 TIRES PER AXLE AT ONLY 5080#. WE HAVE HAD TO CHANGE TO A LOAD RANGE E TIRE WHICH ARE RATED AT 2830# AT 85 PSI. THE DATA TAG IS INCORRECTLY LABELED AND THEREFOR BY FOLLOWING THE TAG FOR REPLACEMENT TIRES WE HAVE BEEN USING TIRES THAT WERE OVER LOADED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO BLOW OUTS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. A TOTAL OF 5 BLOW OUTS AND 2 ADDITIONAL TIRES THAT WERE DEFECTIVE DURING THE TIME WE OWNED THE TRAILER PRIOR TO CHANGING TO LOAD RANGE E TIRES.",
