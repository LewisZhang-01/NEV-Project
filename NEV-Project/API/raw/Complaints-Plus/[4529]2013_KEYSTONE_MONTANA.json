TIRE PRESSURES WERE VERIFIED PRIOR TO OUR TRIP.  ONE TIRE BLEW (SHREDDED) ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WHILE ON RT 95 IN MARYLAND ON JUNE 17, 2015. CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO CAMPER.   I ADDED A TPMS TO MONITOR THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE OF THE TIRES (IN REAL-TIME) SHORTLY AFTER THAT INCIDENT.   ON A SUBSEQUENT TRIP, A SECOND GY MARATHON BLEW OUT ON RT. 95 IN NJ ON JULY 29, 2015, ABOUT 175 MILES INTO OUR TRIP.   IT WAS ALSO ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAMPER.  STARTING COLD INFLATION WAS 78 PSI (PER GY INFLATION TABLES FOR WEIGHT ON AXLES).  MONITOR  SHOWED  APPROX. 89 PSI AND 98 DEGREES (F) AT TIME OF BLOWOUT.  WE WERE ON A SMOOTH, STRAIGHT SECTION OF ROAD AT THE TIME AND DID NOT HIT ANY DEBRIS OR HAZARD.  IT JUST BLEW OUT THE SIDEWALL.  STEEL BELT WAS BADLY DISTORTED.   IN BOTH INSTANCES I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLES.   CHANGING A FLAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE TRAILER IS VERY DANGEROUS.
