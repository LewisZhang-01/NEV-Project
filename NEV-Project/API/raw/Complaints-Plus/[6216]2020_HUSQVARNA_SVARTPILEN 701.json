In the 1500 miles I have owned this motorcycle, I have had 8-10 false neutral cirumstances while in operation, cornering.  This has mostly taken place when upshifting from 4th to 5th or 5th to 6th gears.  Very dangerous.  I have advised KTM and given them a spreadsheet of 19 other people (owners) willing to speak wit them as the parent organization for Husky.  I have received no information that this is being seriously evaluated as a dangerous engineering issue to be remedied.",

        "summary": "KTM, as the parent company of Husqvarna, has continued to put models on the road with problematic clutch slaves from Magura as the OEM clutch slave.  This part is known to be a significant engineering problem and result in loss of clutch functionality on these motorcycles while in operation.  That is what happened to me Friday, July 16th in Redmond, Oregon in traffic.   Fortunately, I was able to get the vehicle, very luckily, out of traffic after the power train completely failed with a failed clutch slave at that time.  There is apparently a revised OEM clutch slave that is in place but they have issued no voluntary recall for prior models affected by this and it cuts across a number of their platforms using a Magura vs. Brembo clutch slave on the 690/701 engine used in the Svartpilen and Vitpilen models as well as several others.  I find it very troubling that KTM/Husqvarna would continue to allow bikes to be built and delivered that fail in their operation on the road and where that failure is likely.  Mine happened with a mere 1500 miles on the new motorcycle.",
