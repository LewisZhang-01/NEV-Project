INITIAL DISCONNECT HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING AND SKYSLIDER WAS CLOSED. IT STARTED TO OPEN UP IN THE FRONT RIGHT CORNER FROM WIND PRESSURE AND WITHOUT PUSHING THE BUTTON TO OPEN IT. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE PINS THAT KEEP THE SLIDER IN PLACE DISCONNECTED AND WILL NOT CONNECT BACK TOGETHER. CURRENTLY FRONT PASSENGER SIDE, REAR DRIVER SIDE, AND REAR PASSENGER SIDE ALL HAVE DISCONNECTED PINS AND THE SLIDER WILL NOT STAY ON THE ROOF WITHOUT INTERVENTION. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY SAID THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS FOR THIS ISSUE. THIS IS VERY MUCH A SAFETY ISSUE AS IF I WERE TO REMOVE THE TAPE HOLDING THE ROOF DOWN, IT WOULD FLY OFF WHILE DRIVING, PUTTING MYSELF AND OTHERS IN DANGER. MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION (AND POOR MANUFACTURING IN MY OPINION) IS THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT HAS CAUSED THIS ISSUE. I HAD USED THE SLIDER LESS THAN 10 TIMES BEFORE THIS HAPPENED. I CONTACTED INSURANCE TO OPEN A CLAIM AND THEY SAID IT WOULD FALL UNDER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION AND THAT WAS NOT COVERED IN MY COVERAGE.",

VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN OFF ROAD AND WAS TAKEN EXCELLENT CARE OFF INCLUDING PROMPT REMOVAL OF ANY ROAD SALT. LAST 3 1/2 YEARS HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN VERY RARELY WHEN IT HAS SNOWED MORE THEN AN INCH UNTIL ROADS WERE COMPLETELY CLEAR. AS OF 3/14/2019 WHEN IT WAS TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP TO BE CHECKED OUT THERE WERE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE AND THERE WAS NO IDEA WHEN THERE WOULD BE PER THE DEALERSHIP WHEN THEY CALLED TO CHECK ON PARTS. ESTIMATED COST FOR REPAIRS PER DEALERSHIP WILL BE ALMOST $1000.00. PER DEALERSHIP THE RUSTED SKID PLATE AND STRAPS LIVES GAS TANK VULNERABLE IN A CRASH OR TO OBJECT INTRUSION. ALSO IF STRAPS RUST ENOUGH COULD CASE GAS TANK TO DROP. PERSONALLY I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL PROBLEM SINCE IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE EASILY FOUND AND COULD CAUSE DEATH OR INJURY. IT HAD NOT BEEN FOUND DURING ROUTE MAINTAINED AND I ONLY FOUND IT BY ACCIDENT WHEN IT WAS UP ON A RACK AND MECHANIC WAS SHOWING ME SOMETHING ELSE. MORE THAN LIKELY THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF SAME MODEL AND YEAR VEHICLES ON ROAD WITH THIS SAME ISSUES THAT OWNERS ARE UNAWARE OF. JEEP DID A RECALL ON 2005 LIBERTY BEFORE DUE TO VULNERABILITY OF GAS TANK CONCERNING THE HITCH. AND SHOULD DO THE SAME WITH THIS AS IT LEAVES THE GAS TANK VULNERABLE AND SHOULD NEVER BE  OCCURRING. IT IS STRICTLY A CASE OF USING INFERIOR MATERIAL ON A VULNERABLE PART.",

REPLACED THE BATTERY ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE BATTERY WAS STILL GOOD. NEW BATTERY DOESN'T LAST OVERNIGHT. FOUND THAT THERE COULD BE 3 ISSUES CAUSING IT. RADIO, FUEL PUMP OR TIPM.  CD PLAYER BEGAN TO CONSTANTLY EJECT A CD WHEN NO CD WAS PRESENT, SO I PULLED THE RADIO FUSE TO STOP THE DRAIN ON THE BATTERY. NO GOOD! NEXT DAY, DEAD BATTERY. LISTENED TO ANY SOUND THAT THE FUEL PUMP WAS RUNNING WHILE ENGINE WAS OFF. DID NOT APPEAR TO BE RUNNING. CHECKED WITH THE JEEP FORUM, WOW WAS I SHOCKED! LIBERTYS HAVE NOTHING BUT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE TIPM. CHRYSLER/JEEP/FIAT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ISSUE BUT HAVE NOT DONE A RECALL, CAUSING ALL IT'S CUSTOMERS HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS T REPAIR A KNOWN ISSUE. CLASS ACTION SUIT ONLY PUSHED THEM TO REPAIR TIPM'S FROM 2010 AND UP VEHICLES LEAVING EVERYONE ELSE HIGH AND DRY. I NOW NEED TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY CABLE EVERY NIGHT SO THE CARE STARTS IN THE MORNING. DEALER WILL DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, AT COST AND THEN FIX THE PROBLEM, AT COST, PLUS LABOR.

SHE BACKED THE JEEP OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY AND CONTINUED DOWN THE ROAD GOING ABOUT 15 MPH.  THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE BLOWS (4 TIRES ON THE VEHICLE BOUGHT APPROX. 14 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT - GOODYEAR P225/75R16 WRANGLER ST 104S) AND THE SIDE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.  VEHICLE DID NOT HIT ANYTHING NOR WAS IT HIT BY ANYTHING.  WIFE DID SUSTAIN A SLIGHT RED BRUISE ON HER LEFT CHEEK.  GOOD THING IT DID NOT HAPPEN WITH ALL OF US IN THE VEHICLE OR GOING 65 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY.  I CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE.  CHRYSLER GROUP LLC CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT AND INSPECTED THE JEEP.  THE INSPECTION FOUND NO INDICATION OF A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT. HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A FRONT TIRE BLOWS AND SIDE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AT 15 MPH.  JEEP IS SUPPOSED TO BE A RUGGED OFF-ROAD VEHICLE.   *TR",

I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP TO JUST PUSH THE ACCELERATOR DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND THIS MAY HELP.  THIS PROCESS IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET PAST THE HILL THE CAR IS THEN MOVING AT A HIGH SPEED WHICH IS ALSO DANGEROUS.  SINCE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEALERSHIP STATES CANNOT BE CORRECTED.  CONSUMERS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THIS MALFUNCTION OF THIS VEHICLE.  ROAD TRIPS ARE NOT SAFE IF YOU DRIVE UPHILL.  NOTHING WILL BE DONE UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS.  UNFORTUNATELY CHRYSLER WILL CONTINUE TO SWEEP THIS UNDER THE RUG UNTIL THEN.  I ALSO CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR CHRYSLER WHICH WAS A WASTE OF TIME DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS HUNG UP ON AND REFUSED A MANAGER AS WELL AS ANY ONE OF AUTHORITY.  I WOULD LIKE A RESOLUTION TO THIS TYPE OF DEFECT WHICH IS NOT A NORMAL OPERATION OF ANY VEHICLE.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MANY CUSTOMERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS AND OBVIOUSLY NOTHING IS GOING TO BE DONE.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE CAR IS SAFE AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CHRYSLER VERIFIED THAT KNOWING THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A PROBLEM WITH HILLS.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BY A MECHANIC THAT THE BODY IS TOO HEAVY FOR A 4 CYLINDER ENGINE.  UNFORTUNATELY CHRYSLER DOES NOT MAKE THE CONSUMERS AWARE OF THIS BEFORE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, WHICH IS A CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL.  I AM SURE THAT EVENTUALLY EVERY CUSTOMER THAT HAS PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IS AWARE OF IT AFTER THE FACT. *TR",
