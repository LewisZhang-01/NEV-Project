P1 NEEDED TO TAKE EXIT 6B TOWARD CA-99 SOUTH IN 1.9 MILES SO I USED MY RIGHT TURN SIGNAL TO INDICATE I WAS SWITCHING FROM LANE 3 TO LANE 2. AS P1 PROCEEDED TO MERGE INTO THE NUMBER 2 LANE TRAFFIC WAS SLOWING DOWN AND I WAS ENTERING THE LANE AT 25 MILES PER HOUR.  STILL TRAVELING WEST BOUND IN THE NUMBER 2 LANE JUST NORTH OF THE 59TH STREET OVERPASS, P2 WHO IS NOW DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF P1 SLAMS HIS BREAKS AND BEGINS TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. P1 WAS DRIVING ABOUT 25 FEET BEHIND P2 AT 25 MPH AND ALSO APPLIED THE FULL FORCE TO THE BREAKS. WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES I FELT A SPONGY FEELING ON MY BRAKE PEDAL, AND IT DIDN'T BEHAVE THE SAME AND I HAD TO REAPPLY MUCH MORE FORCE AT WHICH TIME IT WAS TOO LATE. I COLLIDED WITH THE OTHER VEHICLE AT ABOUT 10 MPH \"",

FIND OUT THIS WAS DUE TO A DEFECTIVE MASTER CYLINDER. THE ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON WITHIN 3-4 YEARS OF HAVING THE VEHICLE, AND WAS FOUND TO BE RELATED TO THE THERMOSTAT, THE ENGINE WOULD ALWAYS RUN TOWARDS THE COOL END, NEVER GOING ABOVE 1/3 OF THE WAY TO THE HALFWAY MARK. THAT WAS FIXED AFTER YEARS OF FAILED ATTEMPT.  AND ALL THE WHILE, I NEVER HAD A FUNCTIONING AIR CONDITION UNIT AND WOULD HAVE TO REPAIR YEARLY, AND THEN FOUND TO BE RELATED THE CAR ALWAYS RUNNING TOO COOL.  OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE GASKET TWICE, BECAUSE OIL WOULD APPEAR IN PLACES IT SHOULD NOT (I ALWAYS MAINTAIN MY CAR BY DOING THE OIL CHANGES, ETC ON TIME).  THIS PAST SUNDAY, I WAS DRIVING AND GOING AROUND 70 MPH WHEN MY CAR STARTED TO DECELERATE TO 65, THEN 60, THEN WOULD NOT GO PAST 40 SO I PULLED OFF THE INTERSTATE AND DROVE BACK HOME.  OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS I SMELLED BURNT OIL, AND THE SAME ISSUE WITH OIL BEING WHERE IT SHOULD BE HAPPENED AGAIN.  MECHANIC IS TELLING ME IT IS DONE, AND AFTER RESEARCHING, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE TO JUST MY CAR.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED MANY HORRIFYING STORES ON THE SAME ISSUE, WITH SOME PEOPLE'S FUSIONS COMBUSTING AND STALLING THEM ON THE HIGHWAY.  I DID NOTIFY THE FORD COMPANY TODAY OF ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO MY CAR, JUST SO THEY HAVE IT DOCUMENTED ON THEIR END AS WELL. I AM APPALLED THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE RECALLS OTHER THAN THE ONE RELATED TO THE AIRBAGS, WHICH THEY CAN NOT FIX YET, POSING MY PASSENGER AT RISK.",

IN WINTER OF 2014 AFTER GOING OVER A PATCH OF ICE AND THE ABS ENGAGING THE BRAKE PEDAL BECAME SPONGY AND WENT TO THE FLOOR. BRAKES STILL APPLIED BUT FELT LIKE MANUAL MODE. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF DIFFICULT BRAKING THE ISSUE RESOLVED ITSELF AND NORMAL BRAKING RESUMED. HOWEVER, EVERY TIME I BRAKED IN A GRAVEL AREA OR SUCH WITH LIMITED TRACTION AND THE ABS WOULD ENGAGE, IT WOULD CREATE A BRAKE ISSUE FOR SEVERAL DAYS.   IN OCTOBER 2015, THE ISSUE BECAME PERMANENT, HOWEVER I FOUND I COULD CORRECT IT TEMPORARILY BY PULLING THE FUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABS CONTROL MODULE WITH ENGINE OFF, STARTING THE CAR WITH IT OUT AND REINSERTING THE FUSE SEEMED TO RESET THE MODULE AND IT WORKED PROPERLY AGAIN FOR A DAY OR 2 AT BEST BEFORE REVERTING BACK TO THE SOFT PEDAL ISSUE.   I ALSO NOTED, PULSING THE PEDAL AND THEN SLAMMING ON THE PEDAL, AS YOU WOULD DURING EMERGENCY BRAKING, WOULD CREATE A NORMAL PEDAL FEEL AT TIMES, BUT THAT IS NOT NEEDED DURING TYPICAL DRIVING AND WOULD IMMEDIATELY REVERT BACK TO POOR PEDAL FEEL. I'VE RECENTLY CALLED MY LOCAL FORD PARTS DEPARTMENT, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PART FOR A 2007 FORD FUSION, PART # 7E5Z 2C215A, IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PART FOR THE 2008 FUSION WOULD FIT OR WORK WITH A 2007 ECU.

FORD SHOULD CONSIDER MY VEHICLE AS \"HIGH RISK\" AND SEND ME THE PAPERWORK I NEED TO HAVE IT REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY.  AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY SHOULD  SEND ME A VOUCHER SO I CAN  TAKE IT TO ANY FORD DEALERSHIP TO GET IT CHECKED - FREE OF CHARGE.

I AGREED TO THIS REPAIR. THEN ON APRIL 2, THE PEDAL ONCE AGAIN WENT TO THE FLOOR WHEN I BRAKED. I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND WAS ABLE TO STOP FOR A RED LIGHT WITHOUT HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS TIME THE DEALER REPLACED THE ABS VALVE MODULE, FLUSHED AND REPLACED THE BRAKE FLUID. LUCKILY DURING BOTH INCIDENTS I WAS DRIVING ON CITY STREETS AT LOW SPEEDS. THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED AFTER I HIT A POT HOLE WITH MY RIGHT FRONT TIRE. AS SOON AS I BRAKED THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. THE SECOND TIME I HIT A ROUGH PATCH WHERE THE STREET HAD BEEN DUG UP AND TEMPORARILY PATCHED. I SUSPECT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN THE ABS SYSTEM AND THE BRAKES. EVEN WITH THE LATEST REPAIR I HAVE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR'S BRAKES. I WOULD HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD A CAR BEEN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME OR HAD I BEEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEED.

THE HANDLE STUCK OUT AND DOES NOT RETURN BACK TO THE NORMAL POSITION AFTER PULLING ON IT. I ROLLED DOWN MY WINDOW TO OPEN MY DOOR USING THE EXTERIOR HANDLE AND HAD TO RESET THE LOCK INSIDE THE DOOR JAM. WHEN EXITING MY VEHICLE, I NOW HAVE TO PULL THE HANDLE OUT HALFWAY AND THEN PULL THE LOCK ABOVE AND THE HANDLE AT THE SAME TIME TO DISENGAGE THE LOCK AND OPEN THE DOOR. BESIDES THIS, THE REST OF THE FUNCTIONALITY SEEMS TO WORK AS EXPECTED. NOT SURE WHY THE INSIDE OF THE HANDLE IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC AND NOT METAL AS I'VE READ DOZENS OF FORUMS ON THE SAME ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY FORD.",

THE THIRD TIME INVOLVED THE SPEED CONTROL BURNING RUBBER ON A WET ROAD AFTER I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO MAINTAIN SPEED GOING DOWN HILL WITH THE SPEED CONTROL SET FOR 35. THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM AS USUAL. THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING  FOR ANY OF MY COMPLAINTS EVEN WHEN THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY. THE DEALER WOULD NOT EVER REPLACE A BROKEN PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE IN THE INSIDE UNTIL IT BROKE OFF COMPLETELY. AFTER THEY REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER PLASTIC HANDLE THE SPRING CUT THROUGH THE PLASTIC AGAIN, BUT I REALIZED THAT THE PIECE OF PLASTIC THE BROKE OFF WAS STILL IN THE RECESSED AREA FOR THE HANDLE AND WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO BREAK OFF COMPLETELY AGAIN IF I HAD NOT REMOVED IT. THE CHROME ALSO PEALED OFF AND CUT MY FINGERS AGAIN SO I SCRAPED IT OFF THE TOP OF THE HANDLE. THEY STILL HAVEN'T CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THAT.

THEY DETERMINED THAT A BOLT CAME LOOSE RELEASING MY TIMING BELT DESTROYING MY ENGINE. I PURCHASED AND EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH SAVED ME $7500 IN REPLACEMENT COST.

THE DESIRED SPEED WAS 45, WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM SPEED IN YELLOWSTONE. THE THROTTLE HAS A DELAY OF ABOUT ONE SECOND, SO IT IS CONTINUALLY 1 SECOND BEHIND THE COMMANDS OF THE DRIVER. THE RESULT IS THAT THE VEHICLE ALWAYS OVERSHOOTS THE SPEED BECAUSE THE DRIVER FIRST EXPECTS A RESPONSE FROM THE VEHICLE, BUT GETS NONE AND CONTINUES TO PUSH THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL FARTHER DOWN. WHEN THE VEHICLE REACHES THE DESIRED SPEED, THE DRIVER LETS UP ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND 1 SECOND AGO. THE DRIVER THEN CONTINUES TO LET UP ON THE PEDAL BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO THE COMMAND TO REDUCE RPM. THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS UP WHEN THE DRIVER LETS OFF THE ACCELERATOR. THE VEHICLE THEN UNDERSHOOTS THE DESIRED SPEED AND THE DRIVER PUSHES THE ACCELERATOR DOWN AGAIN. THE VEHICLE AGAIN DELAYS ITS RESPONSE AND THE TRANSMISSION ADDS AN ADDITIONAL DELAY OF ABOUT 2 SECONDS. THE NEXT OVERSHOOT IS WORSE. THIS OSCILLATION CONTINUES UNTIL THE DRIVER GETS FRUSTRATED AND SETS THE SPEED CONTROL. THE SPEED CONTROL STILL FAILS TO MAINTAIN SPEED WHEN THE GRADE CHANGES RAPIDLY, BUT THE SLOW DOWN IS MUCH LESS AND IT RECOVERS IN A COUPLE SECONDS AND MAINTAINS SPEED THE REST OF THE WAY UP THE HILL.   THE DRIVER THEN HAS TO RIDE THE BRAKES ON THE WAY DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SPEED, WHICH RELEASES THE SPEED CONTROL. THE DRIVER THEN HAS TO SET THE SPEED CONTROL WHEN THE VEHICLE REACHES THE LEVEL AGAIN. IF THE DRIVER LETS THE VEHICLE CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE DOWN THE HILL, THE TRANSMISSION WILL EVENTUALLY DOWNSHIFT AT ABOUT 48 MILES PER HOUR, BUT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY ACCELERATE. CONTINUALLY TRYING TO CORRECT FOR THE LACK OF CONTROL OF SPEED RESULTS IN AN EXCESSIVE DISTRACTION AND CONTINUALLY TAKES THE EYES OF THE DRIVER OFF THE ROAD. *TR",
