HE REPORTED THERE IS A LOOSE WIRES CONNECTION OR FRAYED WIRES AT THE HINGE OF THE TRUNK ON THE DRIVER SIDE. AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION ON THE WIRE HARNESS AT THE HINGE CONNECTION OF THE TRUNK, DISCOVERED AT LEAST ONE WIRE THAT WAS ABOUT THE BREAK OFF FROM OPENING AND CLOSING THE TRUNK OF THE CAR FOR MANY YEARS. AFTER FIXING THESE WIRES, ALL THE SYMPTOMS WERE RESOLVED. AMAZING!!! COULDN'T HAVE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM SO FAST WITHOUT THE READING THE ARTICLE FROM MIKE GERBER. THANKS!!!!!  REASON FROM WRITING THIS COMPLIANT: TOYOTA MANUFACTURE SHOULD RECALL ALL THESE VEHICLES WITH THIS COMPLIANT WITHOUT ANY CHARGES TO THEIR OWNERS.....

ON JAN 22, WE WERE DRIVING ON I 15 FREEWAY SOUTH FROM LA BACK TO LAS VEGAS.  ABOUT AFTER 30 MINUTES ON THE ROAD I HEARD SOMETHING SOUNDING LIKE A CRACK UNDER THE VEHICLE (LAST ONLY ABOUT ONE SECOND).  I THOUGHT THE VEHICLE MIGHT HIT A ROCK UNDERNEATH AND SLOWED DOWN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.   THEN IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES THE VEHICLE LOST THE POWER.  I TURNED ON THE EMERGENCY FLASH LIGHT AND PULLED THE VEHICLE TO THE ROADSIDE.  I COULD SEE THAT THE ENGINE OIL WAS LEAKING OUT BADLY.    AFTER LOTS OF HASSLES THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO CROWN TOYOTA DEALER SHOP IN ONTARIO.  THE NEXT DAY MORNING THEIR SERVICE MANAGER CALLED TO TELL ME THAT NOTHING INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE HIT A ROCK SINCE THERE WAS NO DAMAGE OUTSIDE OF THE ENGINE.  TO THE BEST OF HIS JUDGMENT THE ENGINE WAS DAMAGED FROM INSIDE.  HE SAID SOMETHING FROM INSIDE OF ENGINE COULD FALL DOWN AND KNOCKED THE ENGINE THAT CAUSED THE LEAKING.      SOON AFTER THAT MY INSURANCE COMPANY DENIED MY CLAIM STATING THAT THEY TALKED TO THE CROWN TOYOTA DEALER SHOP AND CONCLUDED THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE ENGINE, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE INSURANCE POLICY.     LAST MONTH I HAD THE ENGINE REPLACED IN AN AUTO SHOP AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  FROM PICTURES ATTACHED ONE CAN SEE A BIG HOLE KNOCKED OUT ON ENGINE(SEE ATTACHED PICTURE).      IT IS A REAL SURPRISE TO ME SINCE THE VEHICLE HAS RUN ONLY 79,500 MILES AND WE GAVE IT MAINTENANCE ON REGULAR BASES AS REQUIRED.  BY THIS LETTER WE REQUEST AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT ENGINE DEFECT CAUSED THE FAILURE AND AN EXPLANATION FROM TOYOTA COMPANY.

I GOT INTO THIS ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS DRIVING MY 2001 CAMRY AT LESS THAN 30 MILES PER HOUR IN A LOCAL STREET/BRIDGE, TRYING TO TURN TO THE LEFT, THERE WERE NO CARS AROUND, ONLY 2 OR 3 CARS FAR AWAY BEHIND ME.  WHILE I WAS TURNING, SUDDENLY THE 2001 CAMRY WAS 'OUT OF CONTROL'. I JUST COULD NOT SLOW DOWN OR STOP THE CAR, NO MATTER WHAT I DID. IT KEPT MOVING AHEAD. I TURNED THE CAR TO THE LEFT AND THEN RIGHT. IT HIT THE LEFT AND RIGHT CURB OF THE STREET/BRIDGE. MY CAR WAS DAMAGED VERY BADLY. FORTUNATELY I WAS OK. I REPORTED THE ACCIDENT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS MOTOR VEHICLE DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, BUT I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE ONLY THING I COULD DO AT THAT TIME WAS TO REPLACE 4 TIRES AND TO REPLACE THE BRAKE SYSTEMS, BESIDES FIXING THE BODY AND THE DAMAGED ENGINE. I SPENT MORE THAN $6000 TO FIX THE CAR AND SIX POINTS WAS ADDED INTO MY CAR INSURANCE.  THE SECOND ONE IN 2009 WAS SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN 2006. IT WAS VERY SCARY. THERE WERE A LOT OF CARS AROUND AND IT COULD BE A HUGE ONE.  MY SON WAS DRIVEN THE SAME CAR, 2001 CAMRY TO THE CHURCH IN CHELMSFORD, MA ON A FRIDAY EVENING. I WAS SITTING BESIDES HIM. HE WAS DRIVING ON THE LOCAL STREET IN LESS THAN 30 MILES PER HOUR AND WANTED TURN TO THE RIGHT AT AN INTERSECTION. SUDDENLY HE COULD NOT SLOW DOWN OR STOP THE CAR. HE ALMOST HIT THE CAR ON THE SIDE STREET WAITING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT. AFTER THAT HE STILL COULD NOT CONTROL THE CAR, THE CAR WAS MOVING AND MOVING AHEAD, AND FINALLY THE CAR WAS INACTIVELY STOPPED BY A SET OF BUSH AND A CURB IN A SMALL PARKING LOT. AGAIN I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THAT TIME. BUT WHY WAS MY 2001 CAMRY OUT OF CONTROL? I AM WONDERING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE INCIDENCE HAPPENS IN A HIGH WAY? MY SON OR I MIGHT BE KILLED! THAT IS REALLY SCARY! *TR",

AFTER PARKING IN THE LIBRARY PARKING LOT, WALKING INTO LIBRARY, A FEW MINUTES LATER, THE LIBRARIAN ANNOUNCED AND ASKED THE OWNER OF CAMRY WITH THE SPECIFIC PLATE NUMBER TO GO TO FRONT LOBBY. HOWEVER, THE LIBRARIAN DID NOT STATE THE REASON. MY WIFE THOUGHT SHE PARKED WELL WITHOUT ANY VIOLATION, SO SHE DID NOT PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT. AFTER LIBRARIAN'S SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT, MY WIFE FELT THAT THE PLATE NUMBER SOUNDED FAMILIAR, SO SHE WENT TO FRONT LOBBY TO CHECK OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHEN MY WIFE GOT OUT TO THE PARKING LOT, SHE SAW POLICE CAR AND FIRE TRUCK, AND HER CAR WAS BURNED OUT. ALL OF THE PARTS INSIDE THE ENGINE COVER WERE ALL MELTED. THE FIRE ALSO DAMAGED THE RIGHT FRONT PANEL OF THE CAR PARKED NEXT TO MY CAMRY. I ASKED MY MECHANIC TO TOW MY CAR TO HIS REPAIR SHOP AND CHECKED MY CAR.

THIS SEEMS A LITTLE DECEPTIVE, ESPECIALLY AS YOU SEARCH THE INTERNET TO DISCOVER THERE ARE SEVERAL CUSTOMERS WHO FOUND THIS FLAW LONG AFTER THEIR WARRANTY EXPIRED.    WE BUY VEHICLES WITH THE INTENT TO KEEP THEM; WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE QUALITY MANUFACTURERS WITH A QUALITY PRODUCT.

WHEN YOU COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND TURN OFF THE ENGINE AND WAIT A FEW MINUTES AND RESTART AND DRIVE THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. THIS HAS HAPPENED THE FOUR TIMES WE HAVE ENGAGED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. OBVIOUSLY WE NO LONGER ENGAGE THE EMERGENCY HAND BRAKE. THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER SAYS HE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS RECEIVED NO NOTICES FROM THE TOYOTA CO. I THINK FOR SOME STRANGE REASON WHEN THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IS ENGAGED AND THEN DISENGAGED THE BRAKE CALIPERS DO NOT FULLY RELEASE AND RUB THE ROTORS. THE MYSTERY IS HOW THE ROTORS WOULD OPEN FULLY JUST BY STOPPING THE AUTO AND TURNING OFF THE IGNITION WITH NO FURTHER TOUCHING OF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE LEVER. ARE THE CALIPERS EFFECTED BY THE ENGINE BEING SHUT DOWN? WHY DOES EVERYTHING RETURN TO NORMAL AFTER STOPPING AND TURNING OFF THE ENGINE? *JB",

I WAS ASKED INTO THE SERVICE AREA TO LOOK AT THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY WORN. THE FRONT TIRES WERE VERY WORN ON BOTH THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE EDGES, THE  CORDING WAS VISIBLE.  THE REAR TIRES WERE WORN EVENLY. STARTED THE COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH IRA TOYOTA. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT BILL DUBE TALKED WITH THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN REPLACING THE TIRES. I REPLACED THE FRONT TIRES  IMMEDIATELY. HAD ALIGNMENT CHECKED. CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH CHRISTINA WOODS WHO INITIATED MY CLAIM/COMPLAINT  I CALLED AGAIN AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND SPOKE TO ANOTHER PERSON, WAS TOLD TO SEND IN ALL MY WORK ORDERS/PAID RECEIPTS AND THEY WOULD REIMBURSE US FOR FOUR NEW TIRES AND THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT.  I HAD THE REAR TIRES REPLACED.  DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE SAID  HE COULD REIMBURSE US FOR TWO TIRES.  WHEN HE WAS INFORMED THAT TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WOULD PAY FOR ALL FOUR HE APPARENTLY BECAME LIVID, CALLED TOYOTA TO COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY HAD USURPED HIS AUTHORITY. NEITHER PARTY WILL NOW REIMBURSE US FOR ANY TIRES.    MY CONCERN AT THIS TIME IS THE SAFETY ISSUE.  DURING MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH TOYOTA AND THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH CAMRYS.  THE TIRES ARE MANUFACTURED WITH VERY SOFT SIDEWALLS (REASON FOR THE SQUEALING) TO IMPROVE RIDE.  THE SIDEWALLS COLLAPSE ON CORNERS CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR, ESPECIALLY ON THE EDGES.

MY INSURANCE COMPANY (AS WELL AS MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND) COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY THE SEAT WOULD BREAK SO EASILY SO WE ASKED FOR TOYOTA TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID THAT BOTH STEEL RODS ON THE SEAT HAD BROKEN BUT COULD NOT TELL US WHY THEY BROKE, THEY HAVE SINCE REPLACED THE SEAT AND NOW THE NEW SEAT HAS A DEFECT ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF DEFECT WOULD CAUSE 2 STEEL RODS TO SNAP WITH SUCH LITTLE DAMAGE DONE TO THE CAR AND WHY AM I HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW SEAT? AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT I WAS 28 WEEKS PREGNANT AND I THANK GOD THAT THE BABY WAS OKAY, HOWEVER I AM NOW SUFFERING NECK ,SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND I AM TERRIFIED TO PUT MY CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT OF MY CAR, I FEEL THAT IT IS UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS FOR ANY OF THEM TO SIT DIRECTLY BEHIND ME BUT WITH 3 CHILDREN I HAVE NO CHOICE!.

        "summary": "ON JANUARY 4, 2002, I WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT WHILE DRIVING MY 2001 CAMRY. A CAR IN FRONT OF ME (DODGE STRATUS) WAS STOPPED WAITING TO TURN LEFT. I WAS BEHIND THE CAR IN A STOPPED POSITION. ANOTHER CAR (1999 CADILLAC DEVILLE) TRAVELING AT ABOUT 40 MPH HIT ME FROM BEHIND FORCING MY CAR INTO THE REAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME RECEIVED DAMAGE TO TRUNK AND BUMPER WITH ENOUGH FORCE/DAMAGE TO CAUSE THE TRUNK TO NOT SHUT WITHOUT REPAIR.  MY QUESTION, CONCERN IS THIS: MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY (NEITHER DRIVER OR PASSENGER) AND ACCORDING TO MY OWNER'S MANUAL THEY SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED. ALSO, THE DRIVERS SEAT WAS FORCED INTO APPROXIMATELY A 45 DEGREE RECLINING POSITION DURING THE IMPACT AND IS CURRENTLY LOCKED INTO THAT POSITION. MY CAR HAD A POWER DRIVER'S SEAT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE COLLAPSED. I AM NOT SURE AT WHAT POINT THE SEAT COLLAPSED BUT THE IMPACT MUST HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO THROW ME FORWARD AND THEN BACK HARD ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE SEAT TO FAIL. AS A RESULT I HAVE SUFFERED SOME BACK AND NECK INJURY AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT.  THE MANUFACTURER INDICATED THAT THE SEATS WERE DESIGNED TO DO THIS BUT I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING IN THE MANUAL, ON THEIR SITE OR ON THE WWW TO THIS EFFECT.  THE IMPACT WAS ENOUGH THAT A BIG MAC IN MY RIGHT HAND WAS THROWN AGAINST THE ODOMETER, DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR AND INTO THE BACK SEAT ON THE WINDOWS.  A 32 OUNCE COKE WAS SPLATTERED THROUGHOUT THE CAR INTO THE DASH ELECTRONICS (CD PLAYER, TAPE DECK, ETC.) AND A CLOSED ARM REST.  THE IMPACT SEEMS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO WARRANT AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT AND THE FACT THAT THE SEAT BACK DID NOT PROVIDE BACK SUPPORT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME.  AT A MINIMUM, IF THE SEATS ARE DESIGNED TO GO BACK LIKE THEY DID IN THIS SITUATION, THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE AWARE.*AK",
