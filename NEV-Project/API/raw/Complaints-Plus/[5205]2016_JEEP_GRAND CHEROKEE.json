I IMMEDIATELY PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK WHERE IT STOOD, MY HUSBAND EXITED THE VEHICLE AND I WENT TO THE BACK TO LEASH AND REMOVE MY TWO DOGS FROM THE BACK SEAT.   ONCE MY DOGS WERE SAFELY OUT OF THE VEHICLE, I HANDED THE LEASH TO MY HUSBAND, WENT BACK TO THE VEHICLE AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE, REMOVED OUR CELL PHONES AND MY PURSE AND STOOD BACK FROM THE VEHICLE.  WHEN NO FLAMES WERE OBSERVED, WE OPENED THE HOOD AND OBSERVED BLACK SMOKE AND SMELLED THE SAME SCENT SIMILAR TO BURNING CLUTCH PLATES.  THE SMOKE APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE BACK OF THE ENGINE NEAR THE FIRE WALL.  I WAITED APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AND WHEN NO FURTHER SMOKE OR ANY OTHER SIGNS OF A FIRE WERE OBSERVED I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE TO MOVE IT FROM THE TRAVEL LANE, THE VEHICLE STARTED AND APPEARED TO RUN AS NORMAL AND NO CODES WERE SHOWING ON THE DASH.  I IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE VEHICLE BACK OFF AFTER MOVING IT APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET TO A SAFE PARKING PLACE AND CALLED FOR TOWING.  THE TRUCK WAS TRANSPORTED TO CRISWELL CHRYSLER IN THURMONT, MD SOME TIME THAT EVENING.  I SPOKE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON, LUKE, AT CRISWELL AND DESCRIBED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  AROUND 4:45PM ON 9/21/20 I WAS TOLD THE TECHNICIAN HAD FOUND MULTIPLE BURN HOLES IN MY \"INTAKE MANIFOLD\".  HAVING OWNED A RAM1500 ECODIESEL AND HAVING HAD THE EGR COOLER RECALLED ON THAT VEHICLE, IT CAME TO ME THAT THIS JEEP COULD BE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT IF WE HAD BEEN DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, WHATEVER CAUSED THE INTAKE MANIFOLD TO BURN, COULD HAVE CAUSED A CATASTROPHIC FIRE EVENT, PUTTING THE LIVES OF MYSELF AND MY FAMILY IN DANGER.

I EXITED THE JEEP WITHOUT AN INCIDENT (NOTICING ANY FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE VEHICLE) AND WALKED TO THE PORCH TO DELIVER A LETTER TO THE HOMEOWNER. I WAS ON THE PORCH WHEN THE JEEP MOVED FORWARD INTO THIS HOMEOWNER'S GARAGE,CRASHING INTO THE TRASH CANS IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE FIRST AND PUSHING THEM INTO THE GARAGE DOOR.

TWO DAYS LATER A CLAIM WAS FILED WITH FCA. THREE DAYS FROM THE INCIDENT, A EAA REPRESENTATIVE CONTACTED ME TO OBTAIN INFORMATION. FOUR DAYS LATER I WAS ASKED TO PICK UP MY JEEP FROM THE DEALER AFTER THEIR INSPECTION.

EACH TIME, THE ENGINE LOUDLY ROARED AND REVVED, AND, UPON GLANCING AT THE DASHBOARD, I SAW VERY HIGH RPM, NEAR THE REDLINE.  EACH TIME, I WAS IN TRAFFIC WITH VEHICLES BEHIND ME, BUT FORTUNATELY (WITH USE OF MY EMERGENCY FLASHERS) I AVOIDED A COLLISION.  IN THE 2ND EPISODE, I WAS ON THE ON RAMP TO AN EXPRESSWAY IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE.    IN TWO OF THE EPISODES, I PULLED OFF THE ROAD TO DROP THE RPM TO IDLE, JIGGLED THE SHIFTER, AND WHEN I MOVED FORWARD AGAIN, THE TRANSMISSION SEEMED TO FUNCTION NORMALLY.  IN THE ABOVE EXPRESSWAY EPISODE, I LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND DID THE SAME WITH THE SHIFTER (ON THE FLY) AND SOMEHOW THE RPM DROPPED AND THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO RESPOND AGAIN.    AFTER THE 1ST EPISODE OCCURRED, I HAVE BEEN EXTRA CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THE SHIFTER IS SEATED IN DRIVE WHEN I BEGIN TO MOVE FORWARD, PLUS I DON'T TOUCH IT WHILE DRIVING, SO I DON'T BELIEVE THE SHIFTER POSITION IS THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE SPECULATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION TOGGLES BETWEEN DRIVE AND NEUTRAL, BUT I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE TRANSMISSION GETS STUCK IN 1ST GEAR, WITH INABILITY TO PROGRESS TO HIGHER GEARS.  IN AT LEAST THE LAST INCIDENT, THE VEHICLE HAD JUST RESTARTED DUE TO ACTIVATION OF THE ELECTRONIC STOP-START SYSTEM (ESS), SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IS INVOLVED.
