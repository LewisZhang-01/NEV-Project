IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, THROUGH NORMAL USE OF THE DOOR, THE TOP HINGE COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE BODY OF THE CAR.  THIS RESULTED IN THE DOOR BEING SUPPORTED SOLELY BY THE LOWER HINGE, MAKING IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO USE.  I CONTACTED 2 DIFFERENT CHEVROLET DEALERS AS WELL AS CHEVROLET'S 800 NUMBER FOR SPECIAL CONCERNS.  ALL ATTEMPTS TO REPORT THE PROBLEM ENDED WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  I FINALLY HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT BODY SHOP.  *AK",
