THIS HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE LAST JULY AFTER THE WARRANTY RAN OUT AT AROUND 28,000 MILES.  2.COME FEBRUARY 2ND THIS YEAR MY RADIO STARTED CONTINUOUSLY POWERS OFF AND ON AND PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE. NOW AT THIS POINT THIS IS CAUSING INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS WITH MY A/C, BLINKERS, SEAT BELT ALARM AND LIGHTS.  3.NOW THE RADIO CONSTANTLY POWERING OFF AND ON EVEN WHEN I AM FINISHED DRIVING AND THE CAR IS PARKED AND LOCKED UP WITH THE FACTORY ALARM ACTIVATED THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF. (TODAY IS MAY 30, 2018).  4.NOW I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH THE BATTERY MAINTAINING ENOUGH CRANKING AMPS TO START MY CAR AFTER SITTING FOR TWO DAYS.   5.LASTLY THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE LINKED TO THIS ONGOING ISSUE FOR MULTIPLE OWNERS. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE FOR MONTHS NOW BUT AS IT KEEPS PROGRESSING IT IS BECOMING A SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES.  6.FINAL NOTE IF YOU HAVE AN EPILEPTIC DRIVER AND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT ON A DARK HIGHWAY LET'S HOPE THAT THE BRIGHT FLASHING DISPLAY FROM THE RADIO CONSTANTLY TURNING OFF AND ON DOES NOT CAUSE THEM TO HAVE A SEIZURE. I KNOW THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DRIVE WHEN MY DISPLAY IS CONSTANTLY GOING OFF AND I AM UNABLE TO MAKE IT STOP SO MY EYES ARE HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST TO INTERIOR LIGHTS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE AT A DISCO.",

I HAVE COMPLAINED MULTIPLE TIMES TO THE GENERAL MOTORS SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHEN I TAKE IT IN FOR SERVICE AND IT HAS BEEN CHECKED REPEATEDLY. IT IS ALWAYS \"OPERATING AS DESIGNED!\" I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SERVICE PERSONNEL INCLUDING THE SHOP SUPERVISOR AND THEY ALL KNOW IT IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES! IT SEEMS TO BE A JOKE THAT THE SYSTEM OPERATES SO POORLY EXCEPT THAT I BELIEVE IT IS INEVITABLE THAT IT WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. EITHER TO MYSELF OR TO SOMEONE ELSE. THE MESSAGE BOARDS ARE FULL OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS FEATURE AND IT IS UNIVERSALLY DESPISED BY EVERYONE ON EVERY VEHICLE IT IS INSTALLED ON! I HAVE ASKED FOR IT TO BE REPAIRED OR REMOVED BY THE DEALER YET THEY TELL ME THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. THE MESSAGE  BOARDS HAVE FOUND A WORK AROUND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM BY INSTALLING A YAW SENSOR WITHOUT THE LATERAL ACCELEROMETER THAT THE VEHICLE USES! I AM WILLING FOR THE DEALER TO DO THIS AT THEIR EXPENSE NOT MINE, BUT THEY REFUSE. IT IS A GM PART INSTALLED ON A GENERAL MOTORS VEHICLE AND DOES NOT DISABLE THE STABILITY SYSTEM. ONLY THE HILL ASSIST PORTION. THIS HAS ALSO CAUSED EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE CLUTCH AND BRAKES AS I HAVE LEARNED TO OVER REV THE ENGINE TO DRAG IT OUT OF THIS LOCK POSITION TO SMOOTHLY MERGE INTO TRAFFIC. I AM COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AS I AM AN ASE MASTER AND L-1 CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN WITH OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING INCLUDING GENERAL MOTORS DEALERSHIPS!  *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION, FROM THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR, HAS NEVER SHIFTED SMOOTHLY WITHOUT GRINDING OR CAUSING MISSED SHIFTS. THIS CAN BE, AND IS A SAFETY HAZARD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT IS A POORLY DESIGNED TRANSMISSION THAT GM IS PUTTING IN THESE CARS AND ENOUGH ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT THEY SHOULD BE FIXING THE PROBLEMS OR REPLACING THE TRANSMISSIONS IN THESE CARS. I WANT THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AND ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *TR",
