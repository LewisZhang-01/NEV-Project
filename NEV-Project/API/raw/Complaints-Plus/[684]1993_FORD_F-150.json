Fueled up rear tank next morning and when I arrived at work and got out with truck still running there was gasoline pouring out from the front gas tank spiller neck at an alarming rate. When I selected the front tank it stopped flowing.  Next day while in traffic at light When I engaged  the gas pedal and fished tailed due to a puddle off gasoline dumping from truck onto rd. In front of rear tires. Started having poor acceleration and seemed as if truck wasn\u2019t getting enough fuel or lacked power. Still has open recall so I brought it to Ford dealership explain the issue and also that cross fuel flow in those year trucks has a recall for same issue. Trucks been there 2 weeks and I\u2019m being told it\u2019s to be $2700 to replace both fuels pumps and shuttle valves. I showed them video of gas pouring from the truck and showed them fords recall and remedy for issue. They said they will not fix this problem in truck and I must cover cost. This after knowing of recall and seeing a video of fuel spillage will not cover cost. This is unsafe I feel as any source of ignition may cause a fire from immediate gas spillages. Ford said they would over do repair if 12 years from start of warranty date of truck or Under 150k . Truck is under that mileage . But refuse to make repair under prior recall  even though this is extremely dangerous situation to be driving truck. Trucks still in shop and I\u2019m awaiting for a response from Ford corporate as I contacted them to explain issue in hopes they would honor repair as I feel it necessary for the safety of myself, family, and those others whom may be hurt in the event an accident occurs.",

YESTERDAY (7/22/2010) I HAD TRAVELED TO MY SISTERS HOME, ABOUT 2 MILES FROM MY HOME.  ON RETURNING I PARKED MY TRUCK AS USUAL AND WENT INTO MY HOUSE. ABOUT I HOUR LATER AS COMING OUT OF MY HOUSE AND HEADING FOR THE GARAGE, THAT WAS WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE FRONT BUMPER WAS TILTED DOWN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. I WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK AND WAS ABLE TO LIFT THE FRONT BUMPER UP OFF THE FRAME. IT WAS JUST HANGING ON.  I'VE CALLED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS MY PROBLEM.  I DID CHECK THE NHTSA WEB SITE AND FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON MY TRUCK BACK IN 1994 (#94V018000). THIS AFTERNOON I DID CALL THE FORD CUSTOMER CENTER ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THEIR REPLY WAS YES THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE TRUCK BUT NOT FOR MINE BECAUSE IT WAS MADE AT ANOTHER PLACE.  I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND, IT THAT RECALL HAD LIMITATIONS WHY ARE THEY NOT SHOWN ON THE RECALL SUMMARY?   THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED TO MY TRUCK AS THE RECALL SHOWN?    THANK YOU,  *TR",

REPAIRS WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BY US AND WILL BE REIMBURST UNON ANY FUTURE RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.   GOSH, I'VE READ SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON THE 1993 FORD 150'S ALL DEALING WITH THIS SIMMILAR TYPE OF SITUATION, BURNING AND SMOKE FROM THE STERING COLUMN. ALL THAT IS STATED IS THAT THE SITUATION IS ELECTRICAL. WELL, IT CERTAINLY IS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND THE MANUFACTURER IS THE SORCE OF THE PROBLEM. USING WIRES TO SMALL FOR THE FUSES THAT THEY INSTALLED IN THEIR VEHICLES. SO LET'S AT LEAST WARN ALL 1993 WEHICLE OWNERS TO THE FACT.   WE WILL BE LOOKING TO REPLACE OUR 1993 FORD AS SOON AS WE CAN AFFORD TO DO SO. I DO NOT WANT TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BY SOME ELECTRICAL FIRE OR BRAKE FAILLURE OR WHAT EVER. I HAVE ALSO SEEN THAT THERE WAS A FATALITY IN ONE THE ELECTRICAL COMPLAINS ON THESE 1993 FORD F-150 VEHICLES......THIS IS TO SCARRY....I DO NOT WANT TO OWN ANOTHER FORD PRODUCT!*AK",

I SAW IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR A PIECE OF RUBBER LANDING IN THE ROAD AND CARS SWERVING BEHIND ME TO MISS IT.  I DIDN'T LOSE CONTROL OF THE TRUCK,  BUT DID IMMEDIATELY PULL OVER.  I OBSERVED THE LEFT REAR TIRE AND THE TREAD WAS MISSING, EXPOSING THE STEEL BELTS AND OTHER FIBERS.  IT WAS STILL INFLATED.  THERE WAS ALSO DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK'S QUARTER PANEL AND TRIM AROUND THE TIRE OPENING.  I CHANGE TO THE SPARE AND CONTINUED ON.

MY MOST RECENT CONVERSATION WITH FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE (SUPERVISOR \u0016 HEATHER \u0016 APPARENTLY SOMEWHERE IN CANADA AND WITH NO CALL BACK NUMBER) WAS THAT FORD WAS NOT REQUIRED TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE THEIR RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE RECALL WAS CLOSED IN 1998 ON THIS VEHICLE, AND EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM EXISTS THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION FOR THIS REPAIR.

THIS ITEM WAS A RECALL ITEM, AND WHEN MY TRUCK WAS IN FOR SERVICE FOR OTHER WORK AT COX FORD IN HAMPSTEAD MD THEY INDICATED THAT THEY PERFORMED THE RECALL REPAIR ON THE FUEL SYSTEM FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM, THOUGH I WAS HAVING NO TROUBLE WITH THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY AT THAT TIME. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF LATER I NOTICED THAT AFTER I EXHAUSTED THE FRONT TANK AND SWITCHED TO THE REAR TANK, ONCE THE REAR TANK WAS EXHAUSTED I NOTICED THAT THE FRONT TANK WOULD THEN HAVE AS MUCH AS 1/3 TANK OF FUEL IN IT.  I DECIDED TO LIVE WITH THE PROBLEM FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT APPROACHED THE DEALER ABOUT THIS DURING APRIL 1999 AND THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT SINCE THE RECALL REPAIR HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DONE AND THE REPAIR WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, ANY SUBSEQUENT REPAIRS WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT VERY HAPPY WITH FORD'S HANDLING OF THIS PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM COMPOROMISES MY VEHICLE'S SAFETY AND RESALE VALUE, AND I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PUMP MY REAR TANK BEFORE THE FRONT IS EMPTY.  *AK",
