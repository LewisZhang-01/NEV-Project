THE ISSUE IS WELL KNOWN BY JEEP OWNERS FROM MAINLY 2010-2012 JEEPS, BUT CHRYSLER HAS REFUSED TO ADMIT AND FIX THE ISSUE.  THE CAUSE OF THE ISSUE TYPICALLY HAS BEEN LINKED TO EITHER A) CASTING SAND USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOTOR, OR B) CHEMICALS IN THE COOLANT DEVELOPING A SAND-LIKE SLUDGE. MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN TWO FAILED HEATER CORES WITHIN 9 MONTHS OF EACH OTHER.  THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED ON 25DEC2013 AND WAS REPAIRED 30DEC2013 AT 68,345 MILES.  ON A TRIP AWAY FROM HOME IT FAILED AGAIN ON 11SEP2014 AT 85,157 MILES.  ON THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE, WHEN THE HEATER CORE CLOGGED AND BLEW, THE SYSTEM BLEW HOT STEAM INTO THE CABIN AND COOLANT (AROUND A TEMPERATURE OF 200*F) POURED ONTO THE PASSENGERS SIDE FLOORBOARD.  LUCKILY I DID NOT HAVE THE HEAT VENTS TURNED TO ME OR HAD A PASSENGER AT THE TIME BECAUSE I OR MY PASSENGER WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN INJURED.

THEY TOLD ME MANY CHRYSLER VANS AS WELL AS SOME 2009 AND 2010 HAVE A DEFECT IN THE BRAKES THAT CAUSE THEM TO FAIL WAY SOONER THEN THEY SHOULD. I PAID ALMOST $400 FOR THE BACK BRAKES TO BE DONE AND CALLED CHRYSLER CORP AND MADE A CASE. THEY AGREED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED AT THAT LOW MILEAGE AND OTHERS HAVE DONE ALSO. I AM GOING TO GET A TOTAL REFUND FOR WHAT I SPEND AFTER MANY CALLS TO GET IT PAID BY THEM AS I FEEL IT IS A UNSAFE CONDITION THAT MANY OTHER PRODUCTS THEY MAKE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS AND WHY I SHOULD PAID FOR A DEFECT IN THEIR BRAKE SYSTEMS. I ASKED IN THE NEXT 12000 MILES IF THEY WEAR OUT AGAIN WILL THEY REPAIR THE PROBLEM AGAIN AND SHE SAID NO. IT IS NOT FAIR OR SAFE TO HAVE A JEEP THAT WILL KEEP HAVING THE REAR BRAKES WEAR OUT WAY BEFORE TIME AND A UNSAFE CONDITION TOO. I CALLED A FEW BARKS ROTOR MFG. COMPANIES AND THEY TOLD ME ALSO THEY HAVE A MAJOR DEFECT IN THEIR BRAKE SYSTEMS AS THE WEIGHT OF THEM AS CERTAIN JEEPS AND VANS IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR THE BRAKE SYSTEM THEY HAVE ON THE REARS AND FRONTS. I ALSO SEE CLASS ACTION LAW SUITS AGAINST THEM ON THIS BRAKES WEAR OUT PROBLEMS ON 2009 AND 2010 VANS  THAT ARE IN A  DODGE JOURNEY BULLETIN WB-D-11-07 AND IT IS THE SAME AS MY DEFECT BUT THEY SAID IT DOES NOT COVER THE JEEP LIBERTY BUT WILL REFUND MY MONEY ONCE FOR THE COST I PAID.
