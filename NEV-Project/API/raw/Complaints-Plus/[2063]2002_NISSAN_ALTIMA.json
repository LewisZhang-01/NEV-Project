IN TALKING TO A NISSAN MECHANIC AND DOING ONLINE RESEARCH, THIS IS APPARENTLY NOT AN UNHEARD OF PROBLEM FOR NISSAN CARS.  THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST FOR SOME NISSAN 4 CYLINDER CARS BUT THERE WAS NEVER A RECALL FOR 6 CYLINDER NISSAN ALTIMA CARS (MY CAR IS A 3.5L 6 CYLINDER MODEL)    THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE.  I PARKED IT AT MY GYM AND WHEN I CAME OUT, STARTED IT UP. I WAS REWARDED WITH AN AWFUL NOISE AND ENGINE VIBRATION ALL OF A SUDDEN.  I ONLY LIVED 1.5 MILES AWAY, SO I SLOWLY LIMPED THE CAR HOME.    AFTER SOME MECHANICAL SLEUTHING AND BRINGING A MECHANIC TO MY HOME, WE DETERMINED THAT A SCREW HAD COME LOOSE AND GOTTEN SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE.    I CALLED NISSAN USA TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM AND SEE IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE.  BUT ALL THEY OFFERED WAS THAT THEY \"WOULD TAKE A LOOK \" AT THE PROBLEM IF I PAYED TO TOW THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP.  THEY WOULD NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE THAT THEY WOULD THEN HELP ME IF THE PROBLEM TURNED OUT TO BE AS I HAVE DESCRIBED.  IF THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THEN I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TOWING THE CAR BACK TO MY HOUSE.    HERE IS ONE URL THAT LISTS 10 COMPLAINTS FOR THIS PROBLEM WITH NISSAN PATHFINDER AUTOS, WHICH USE THE SAME 6 CYLINDER ENGINE AS MY CAR.  HTTPS://REPAIRPAL.COM/LOOSE-SCREWS-INSIDE-INTAKE-MANIFOLD-CAN-CAUSE-INTERNAL-DAMAGE-IF-THEY-FALL-OUT-448    WHAT MAKES THIS SO AWFUL IS THAT I HAD A RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE OLDER CAR (2002 WITH ONLY 95K MILES) AND THIS PROBLEM MAKES THE WHOLE CAR A JUNKER NOW DUE TO NO FAULT OF MY OWN WITH NO RECOURSE FOR ME!",

I WAS VERY EXPLICIT IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OIL CONSUMPTION AS WELL AS METALLIC RESIDUE ON COMPONENTS - (I HAD REPLACED THE CAM / CRANK POSITION SENSORS WHEN THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH - THEY BOTH HAD A GREY PASTE RESIDUE ON THEM).  NISSAN ACKNOWLEDGED THE ENGINE WAS INDEED DAMAGED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR NEARLY 2 MONTHS, I RECEIVED A CALL ADVISING THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS ANYMORE AND WOULD NEED TO USE AFTERMARKET PARTS.

MULTIPLE TIMES, NISSAN CALLED TO SAY THEY HAD THE PARTS AND THE REPAIR WOULD BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF THE NEXT WEEK.  THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

JUST 5 OR 6 DAYS LATER, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON ENGINE STARTED MAKING A LOUD KNOCKING SOUND WHEN YOU CRANK IT UP AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR A WHILE. I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL AND IT NEEDED A QUART OF OIL, SO I ADDED A QUART. THE NOISE CAME BACK AFTER 2 DAYS. THIS IMMEDIATELY BECAME A MANDATORY ISSUE TO CHECK THE OIL LEVEL AND ADD MORE OIL EVERY 2 TO 3 DAYS. IT IS NOW AUGUST 7TH AND I HAVE TO CHECK AND REFILL THE OIL EVERY DAY! I STARTED MY RESEARCH FOR COMPLAINTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND FOUND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THE SAME ISSUE ALONG WITH RECALLS FOR REPLACING THE ECM, CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND/OR ENGINE. THE ECM RECALL APPLIED TO THIS CAR, SO I HAD THAT DONE ON JULY 30TH ALONG WITH AN OIL CHANGE. ON TOP OF THAT, I JUST SPENT $1006.62 TO GET THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED YESTERDAY ALONG WITH A QUART OF OIL. GOT THE KNOCKING SOUND AGAIN THIS MORNING. I TOOK IT TO THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING AND THEY SAID IT NEEDS A NEW ENGINE. MY WIFE AND I ARE SO UPSET NOW.

IF IT HAD HAPPENED THEN I MAY HAVE BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER CAR.  SINCE THIS PART IS STILL DEFECTIVE OR NOT REDESIGNED IT IS PUTTING OTHER NISSAN OWNER'S AT RISK OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THERE SHOULD BE A SECOND RECALL TO REPLACE THIS PART AGAIN.  THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE \"SENSOR\" THAT CAUSES YOUR CAR TO NOT START, THIS IS LIFE THREATENING!  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE ANY DISTANCE FOR FEAR OF THIS HAPPENING FURTHER FROM HOME AND EITHER CAUSING ME TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT OR HAVING A HUGE TOWING BILL.  NISSAN WAS VERY UNCOOPERATIVE IN NUMBER ONE, NOT WILLING TO REIMBURSE ME BECAUSE I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND NOT A DEALER, I'M PSYCHIC LIKE THAT, AND TWO, NOT ISSUING ANOTHER RECALL WHEN THE NISSAN SERVICE REP TOLD ME THAT THESE HAVE BEEN REPAIRED MORE THAN ONCE AFTER THE RECALL.  I HOPE THE NHTSA DEPARTMENT CAN SEE THE URGENCY OF THIS COMPLAINT TO ISSUE A SECOND RECALL.  THANK YOU.",

IT WILL TAKE 10 DAYS AND COST $3,232.38.  I THEN TOOK THE CAR TO SANTA FE BODY INC. WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT BODY SHOP.  THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE SOME OTHER ALTIMA'S AND CHARGE $500 PER SIDE FOR $1000.  THEY CUT OUT THE RUSTED AREA AND REPLACE IT WITH SHEET METAL.  THIS WILL TAKE 1-2 DAYS.  THE NHTSA NEEDS TO FORCE NISSAN INTO A RECALL AS IT IS A DESIGN FLAW AND SAFETY ISSUE.

LITERALLY, I DID YELL OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND FEAR AS I HAVE SMALL DOGS AND WHEN I TRAVEL, I HAVE ONE THAT DOES GET ON THE FLOOR AND SNIFF AROUND.  HE COULD HAVE EASILY FALLEN THROUGH IF THE CARPET WAS NOT SECURE!  I WAS IN SHOCK AND ACTUALLY STILL AM AND DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO WITH MY CAR.  I AM SAD BECAUSE IT WAS A GOOD CAR.  I WANTED TO DRIVE IT UNTIL 200,000 MILES BECAUSE THE ENGINE STILL HAS THE ABILITY TO GET UP AND GO!  SINCE MONDAY I'VE FREQUENTED MANY WEBSITES AND HAVE SEEN THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH MANY 2002 NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS AND FIND IT VERY SAD THAT THE MOTOR AND BODY OF A CAR OUTSTAND THE ACTUAL FRAMEWORK.  THIS MAKES ME FEEL REALLY SAFE ON THE ROAD TODAY.  WHAT ARE WE PUTTING ON OUR ROADS IN THE WINTER, ACID?  I KEEP MY CAR CLEAN TOO.  I'M NOT A PERSON WITH A LOT OF MONEY SO I AM IN LIMBO RIGHT NOW.

WHEN I CHECKED FOR THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL, THERE WAS BARELY ANY OIL LEFT. I IMMEDIATELY PUT 5 QTS OF MOBILE FULL SYNTHETIC OIL AND TOOK IT TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN DENVILLE, NJ. THERE I GOT A SHOCKER THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTOR OF MY CAR GOT SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE AND FURTHERMORE SOME OF THAT MATERIAL WAS BRACING AGAINST THE CYLINDER WALLS. IT WAS THE REASON WHY MY CAR WAS RUNNING ROUGH SOMETIMES AND BURNING OIL. I WAS FURTHER TOLD THAT THE ONLY FIX TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO REPLACE BOTH THE ENGINE AS WELL AS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTOR. JOB COST WAS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND $6000 TO $6500. THE DEALERSHIP FURTHERMORE WARNED ME ABOUT THE FIRE HAZARD OR ENGINE SEIZURE DUE TO OVERHEATING. WITH SOME INVESTIGATION I FOUND A NHSTA RECALL ON MY GENERATION OF  ALTIMAS-NHTSA CAMPAIGN# 03V084000.   IN ORDER TO SEEK FURTHER HELP IN THIS REGARDS, I OPENED UP A CASE WITH NISSAN MOTORS USA- CASE # 12257145.

I ASKED HER ABOUT THE NHSTA CAMPAIGN FOR MY CAR, FOR WHICH SHE ASKED ME TO HOLD ON TO THE CAR FOR A FEW MORE DAYS, BEFORE THEY COULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE. ON, 10/14/2013 I GOT A CALL FROM THE SAME REPRESENTATIVE AND THIS TIME I WAS GIVEN A DIFFERENT ANSWER STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTOR HAS A WARRANTY OF 80,000 MILES BUT IT IS FOR ONLY 8 YRS. I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE WARRANTY, BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I DROVE VERY LESS, BUT STILL MY CAR IS 10+YRS OLD. SHE FURTHER TOLD ME THAT NISSAN WILL NOT BARE ANY EXPENSE ON MY CAR.  *TR",

NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN MANSFIELD, OHIO CONFIRMED THIS DIAGNOSIS ON 9-20-2011.    ALERTED NISSAN NORTH AMERICA ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE OF A VEHICLE RECALL EXECUTED BY THE NHTSA IN 2003.

ALSO BEGAN HAVING HEATING ISSUES (WHICH PERSIST)IN THE WAY THAT IT WILL ONLY GIVE OFF HEAT IF CAR IS MOVING AT 2RPMS OR HIGHER. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON PROBABLY WITHIN FIRST 6 MONTHS AND HAS ONLY NOT BEEN ON SINCE THEN WHEN A MECHANIC \"RESETS\" IT--AND THAT LASTS SHORT PERIOD(LIKE WEEK). THIS CAR DIED WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE FOR NO APPARENT REASON WINTER OF 2009. IT WAS FOUND TO NEED NEW ENGINE. REPLACEMENT WITH USED ENGINE APPROX $4,000.00. THIS ENGINE PROMPTLY DIED IN LESS THAN A MONTH AND YET AGAIN NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. A 2005 MOTOR WAS THEN PUT IN MY CAR, BUT GUESS WHAT?? SAME PROBLEM WITH OIL MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHING AND NO LEAKING ON GROUND AND NO LEAK TO BE FOUND. SPRING OF 2010 ALL RECALL WORK DONE, INCLUDING SENSOR 03V084000 WHICH COULD CAUSE A FIRE.

ALSO THROUGH WEB-BROWSING THAT  THIS CAN CAUSE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO BE ON ALL THE TIME, IS RELATED TO THE RECALLED SENSOR, AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR ENGINE REPLACEMENT.

IF SUBSTRATE PARTICLES ENTER THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER, THEY COULD SCORE THE CYLINDER WALLS, RESULTING IN INCREASED OIL CONSUMPTION. IF THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL IS NOT CHECKED ON A PERIODIC BASIS AND DROPS BELOW THE LOW LEVEL, AND THE DRIVER CONTINUES TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE IGNORING NOTICEABLE ENGINE NOISE, ENGINE DAMAGE MAY OCCUR WHICH COULD RESULT IN A FIRE. NISSAN IS STILL DEVELOPING A REMEDY FOR THE PRE-CATALYST PROBLEM. CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO CONTACT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S AUTO SAFETY HOTLINE AT 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236).   *TR",

HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS THE ENGINES WERE DAMAGED CAUSING EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION.  THE PROBLEM IS ALL CONNECTED BUT THEY DIDN'T REPLACED THE ENGINES WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN UPGRADED.  HERE'S A LINK TO THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS EVEN AFTER THE RECALLED PARTS WERE REPLACED (KEEPING IN MIND THAT NOT EVERYONE MAKES A REPORT). HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/NISSAN/ALTIMA/2002/ENGINE/EXCESSIVE_OIL_CONSUMPTION.SHTML    NISSAN KNEW THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS CONNECTED BUT THEY ONLY ADDRESSED A PART OF IT.  AS YOU REVIEW THE COMPLAINTS, YOU WILL SEE THAT THEIR RECALL DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  SOME HAD THIS EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM AS EARLY AS 20-40K MILES.  I THINK NISSAN SHOULD REPLACE THE ENGINES, ALONG WITH A NEW CONVERTER AND MANIFOLD.  IF THE WHOLE THING IS NOT REPLACED THE PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO REPEAT ITSELF AS ONE PART WILL CAUSE THE OTHER TO FAIL.  A NEW ENGINE FOR THIS CAR IS ROUGHLY $2900 + TAXES, MANIFOLD $500 INSTALLED, NOT SURE OF THE COST FOR THE CONVERTER.  I AM NOT BASHING THE COMPANY, I HAVE OWNED A NISSAN FOR 16YRS WITH NO PROBLEMS OTHER THAN NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  REPLACING THE ENGINE IS SOMETHING THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT ONLY CHOOSE TO ADDRESS A PART OF THE PROBLEM.

AGAIN THIS PROBLEM IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS ISSUE.

BECAUSE VARIOUS MECHANICS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, WE HAVE GIVEN UP ON DRIVING THE VEHICLE.  WE HAVE NOW BEEN THROUGH THREE ALTERNATORS, A BATTERY, AND SOME WIRING.

THEY ALSO ASSURED MY WIFE THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THE VEHICLE. I TOLD THEM NOT TO FIX IT.  WHEN I WENT TO INSPECT IT MYSELF, IT WAS PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT THE BOLT WAS NOT WELDED TO THE ALTERNATOR, IT WAS JUST NOT FULLY TIGHTENED DOWN.

IT STATES THAT DUE TO THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS, THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF WHILE IN OPERATION RESULTING TO A ACCIDENT/CRASH.  SO I BROUGHT INTO NISAAN TO HAVE THIS THESE FIXED ALONG WITH OTHER RECALLS.  THEY SAID THAT ONLY THE CAMSHAFT WAS FIXED AND NOT THE CRANKSHAFT.  IT WASN'T A RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE ACCORDING THE VIN#.  I THOUGHT IT RIDICULOUS AND A COINCIDENCE THAT THE SENSOR THAT CAUSED MY CAR TO SHUT OFF WASN'T A RECALL FOR MY CAR.  SO I ENDED UP BUYIN THE SENSOR FOR AROUND 80 DOLLARS.  BUT AFTER A FEW WEEKS AFTER FIXING, IT MY CARS STALLS OUT AGAIN WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY WITH BOTH OF MY LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE CAR ALMOST ENDING UP WHAT WOULD OF BEEN A REAL BAD CRASH.  FORTUNATELY I WAS IN THE INSIDE LANE WITH LIGHT TRAFFIC AND ABLE TO QUICKLY PULL INTO THE BREAKDOWN LANE.  MY CAR WOULD STILL BE RUNNING BUT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE WHEN IN DRIVE.  AFTER WAITING FOR A 15 MINS IT WOULD START TO ACCELERATE AGAIN AND WHEN I START TO SLOW DOWN IT WOULD STALL AGAIN.  THIS WOULD GO ON AND ON UNTIL I FINALLY GOT TO A REPAIR SHOP FOR HELP.  MY CAR WAS PUT THROUGH A DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND IT CAME UP TWICE FOR CRANKSHAFT SENSOR FAILURE.  I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER 80 DOLLARS ON A SENSOR THAT WILL FAIL AGAIN.

AT THE TIME, I FELT THAT HER FOOT MAY HAVE SLIPPED OFF THE CLUTCH INSTEAD, UNTIL IT LOST PRESSURE AGAIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WHILE DRIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS.  I STARTED RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE MODEL EXHIBITING VERY SIMILAR BEHAVIOR.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN TRAFFIC IT'S DANGEROUS, BECAUSE IT CAN LURCH BY ITSELF OR YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SHIFT INTO GEAR TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING VEHICLES, LIKE IF YOU'RE CROSSING TRAFFIC. IT ALSO INHIBITS THE ABILITY TO DOWNSHIFT WHEN GOING DOWNHILL.  NISSAN DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE HAVE BADGERED THE DEALERSHIPS INTO REPLACING THE CLUTCH MASTER CYLINDER AND/OR SLAVE CYLINDER UNDER WARRANTY, AND NISSAN HAS NOT HAD A RECALL FOR THE PROBLEM.

THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER IS ALLOWING AIR, AND/OR MOISTURE, TO ENTER THE SYSTEM, BUT MOREOVER, THE DOT 3 FLUID THAT IS USED SEEMS TO BE THE MAJOR FACTOR IN THE FAILURE, WHERE AS DOT 4 OR 5.1 SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD.  I HAVE NOT DONE ANY REPAIR TO THE CAR SINCE SHE HAS IT AT SCHOOL, BUT I WILL HAVE IT FIXED AS SOON AS I GET IT BACK HOME.",

MY SPARKS PLUG KEPT GOING BAD AFTER SIX MONTHS. I  WOULD STARTED IT UP AND WOULD GET A RATTLING NOISE, THEN I WOULD HEAR WATER COMING FROM MY FRONT DASH. MY CAR WAS BEING MAINTAINED VERY WELL. UNTIL IT STARTED TO PUT OIL EVERY WEEK, I HAD IT LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS TOLD NEEDED MY OIL FLUSHED, THEN MY I HAD TO REPLACE SPARK PLUGS. I DID EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO DO BUT THE ISSUE WAS STILL HAPPENING. MY ENGINE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON, 2 CYLINDER MISFIRE, 02 SENSOR, CAT CONVERTER. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC AND REPLACED THE CENSOR ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF CAME BACK ON 1 WEEK LATER HAD IT REPLACED AGAIN. I WOULD COME TO A STOP AND WOULD JERK PUT IN NEUTRAL AND STOPS, GET HOME CHECK MY OIL BONE DRY. I HAD AN MECHANIC LOOK AT SO MANY TIMES THAT I WAS THROWING MONEY AWAY ENDURING THIS FOR ONE WHOLE YEAR AND NO MECHANIC CAN FIND THE SOLUTION. I WAS TOLD TO KEEP OIL IN MY CAR. THIS WAS JUST UNACCEPTABLE. ON AUGUST 27TH 2010 I WENT TO LEAVE FROM WORK AND SAW A CLOUD OF SMOKE TOOK IT THE MECHANIC ONLY TO BE TOLD I NEED A NEW ENGINE I WAS APPALLED. BECAUSE MY ENGINE SHOULD NOT HAVE WENT THIS SOON. WELL I REVIEWED COMPLAINTS ON THE 2002 NISSAN ALTIMA AND WHAT I COME TO FOUND OUT MANY CONSUMER ALL OVER THE U.S.A. HAD THE SAME ISSUES I EXPERIENCED. THIS VERY UPSETTING. I FEEL NISSAN SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THERE PRODUCTS. I HAVE WENT TO MANY WEBSITE AND FOUND MANY CONSUMERS HAVE MADE  ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THERE ENGINE REPLACE AND TO NO SATISFACTION NISSAN HAS TURNED THE OTHER EAR.

THE CORROSION APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO TWO FACTORY HOLES IN THE FLOOR, ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.    THE CORROSION ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF OUR CAR IS LESS SEVERE: A LARGE AREA OF RUST BUT A RELATIVELY SMALL HOLE (TENNIS BALL SIZE) THROUGH THE SHEET METAL.  THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAR HAS A LARGE HOLE (SOCCER BALL SIZE) IN THE FLOOR.    THIS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CORROSION ON THE CAR (THE \"REAR SUBFRAME\" ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED IN 2006 DUE TO CORROSION UNDER A NISSAN WARRANTY PROGRAM).  THE FUEL FILLER NECK IS ALSO RUSTY AND DOES NOT SEAL PROPERLY, WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ENGINE ALERT WHEN THE FUEL VAPOR SEAL LEAK REACHES THE POINT WHERE THE ALERT IS TRIGGERED.  THERE IS LITTLE OR NO CORROSION IN THE WHEEL WELLS OR FENDERS.  BASED ON TWO BIDS FROM AUTO BODY SHOPS IN THIS AREA, THE COST TO REPAIR THE RUST DAMAGE WILL BE BETWEEN $2500 AND $3200.  I HAVE TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY ALTIMAS IN THIS AREA.  ALL BUT FIVE HAVE CORROSION IN THIS SPECIFIC AREA TO VARYING DEGREES.  IT IS CLEARLY NOT LIMITED TO ONLY THE CAR WE OWN.

THE HEAD GASKET BLEW ON MY 2002 2.5 S QR25 4 CYLINDER ENGINE.  I HAD THE HEAD GASKET REPLACED AND IT BLEW AGAIN.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION THE HEAD HAD BEEN CRACKED AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF MARKS IN CYLINDER 1.  ONE OF THE POWER VALVE SCREWS LOCATED IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD OF THE ENGINE CAME LOOSE AND SHOT THROUGH THE ENGINE, RUINING ENGINE COMPRESSION (IN TURN DESTROYING THE ENGINE) AND IT ALSO DESTROYED THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD, O2 SENSOR AND POWER VALVE INTAKE AND POWER VALVE PLATES.  THE ESTIMATE TO REPAIR THIS IS OVER 6000.  APPARENTLY ONE OF  POWER VALVE SCREWS HAD GOTTEN LOOSE AND WAS BANGING AROUND THE ENGINE.  APPARENTLY THIS CAN RUIN THESE ENGINES.  I EXPERIENCE POWER LOSS BECAUSE OF THIS.  MY CAR HAS STALLED SEVERAL TIMES NEARLY CAUSING A SEVERE ACCIDENT EACH TIME.  THE VEHICLE STARTS RIGHT UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT STOPS.

THEY THEN SAID THEY COULD NOT RESTART MY COMPUTER OR DO THE RECALL BECAUSE IT HAD A CODE THAT NEEDED TO GET FIXED. I SAID FINE, AND PAID FOR THEM TO FIX IT AND THE RECALL. LATER THAT DAY MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND THEY HAD ME COME BACK IN A WEEK LATER AND ADVISED ME A NEW CODE CAME ON. I ASKED WHY THEY DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT IT WHEN I WAS THERE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE IT THEN. I DID MORE RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THE CODES THEY FOUND WERE PART OF THE RECALL, AND THAT WAS THE REASON MY ENGINE BLEW UP. BUT THEY WOULD NOT FIX OR PAY FOR IT. I HAVE BEEN BACK AND FORTH ON THIS AND FINALLY I FOUND A NUMBER TO CALL REGARDING NISSAN RECALLS. THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH ADVISED ME THAT IT WAS NISSAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE FIXED THE ISSUE AT NO COST SINCE IT WAS A RECALL AND IT WAS ALL CONNECTED.

UNDERSTAND THAT THE CATALYTIC WARRANTY WAS 80,000 MILES, BUT SHOULD A CATALYTIC BREAKDOWN ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO RUIN THE ENGINE?  IF NISSAN KNEW IT DID NOT TOTALLY RESOLVE THE ISSUE, THEY SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED OWNERS TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC AT XX MILES, OR AT XX YEARS.

I WENT THROUGH THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION WEBSITE WHICH CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND IT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED BY NISSAN. NISSAN HAS ALSO TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAME AND HENCE RELEASED THE RECALL CAMPAIGN BULLETIN. HOWEVER, NISSAN ARE DECLINING MY CASE BASED ON THREE REASONS ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AT 1ST THEY SAID  I AM NOT A LOYAL CUSTOMER , HOWEVER WHEN I INSISTED THEN THEY SAID MY VIN NO. DOES NOT FALL IN THE CATEGORY AND THEN ON THE 3RD CALL AFTER TOO MUCH OF PERSEVERANCE THEY SAID THEY DECLINE BECAUSE I AM THE SECOND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE AND I DO NOT HAVE MAINTENANCE RECORD FROM THE FIRST OWNER. AS A PROOF OF MAINTENANCE I HAVE ALREADY FAXED THEM THE CAR FAX REPORT WHICH SHOWS THE CAR WAS PROPERLY MAINTAINED. HOWEVER, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE MAKE AND MODEL WILL NOT CHANGE WITH THE OWNERSHIP MY CONCERN IS THAT EVEN IF I CHANGE THE CATALYST CONVERTER AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE  THEN THERE ARE CHANCES THAT IF MY ENGINE CATCHES ANY PARTICLES DUE TO PRECATALYST DAMAGE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT MY ENGINE WILL CATCH FIRE AND I MIGHT BE BLOWN OUT WHILE DRIVING.

AROUND 9.00 PM, ON I-80, APPRX 40 MIL FROM CLEVELAND, SUDDENLY SMOKE STARTED COMING FROM THE CAR HOOD, CAUSING POOR VISIBILITY. TEMP AND OIL LEVEL INDICATORS DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGN OF PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE. AFTER NARROWLY ESCAPING CRASH WITH OTHER VEHICLES BY GRACE OF GOD, WE COULD STOP THE CAR WITH SMOKE STILL COMING OUT. BY THE TIME I MOVED EVERYBODY AWAY FROM THE CAR, THE SMOKE STOPPED. THIS SUDDEN FAILURE OF THE ENGINE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DISASTROUS, ENDANGERING PRECIOUS LIVES.  ON CRANKING THE ENGINE, LOUD NOISE FROM THE ENGINE MADE US BELIEVE THAT CAR WAS IN BAD SHAPE, SO CAR WAS TOWED TO NISSAN OF  NORTH OLMSTED, OH (DEALER). AFTER INSPECTION ON MON, 6/15/09 I WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE CASTING  HAD A BIG HOLE APPRX 2\" BIG. WE WERE ASKED TO EITHER SCRAP THE CAR OR REPLACE THE ENGINE WITH ESTIMATED COST OF $4500. WE WERE NOT TOLD ANY GOOD REASON FOR THIS ENGINE FAILURE. BEING STRANDED WITH MY  FAMILY FOR 3 DAYS AND DESPAIRED, I DECIDED TO REPLACE ENGINE HOPING TO GET COMPENSATION FROM NISSAN. INITIAL POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM NISSAN CUSTOMER AFFAIRS BECAME VERY DISSATISFYING AND FRUSTRATING AFTER I PAID THE DEALER. IT WAS A SHOCK TO US THAT AFTER CALLING SO MANY TIMES NISSAN DID NOT TOOK ANY RESPONSIBILITY STATING ON 6/24 THAT \"THE VEHICLE IS OUTSIDE OF MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY\"   LATER I FOUND MANY PUBLICATIONS STATING THAT 2002, NISSAN ALTIMA-2.5L ENGINES HAVE FACED SIMILAR ENGINE FAILURES BUT NISSAN HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO AVOID SUCH INCIDENTS. IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS IS NOT EXPECTED FROM SUCH A REPUTED ORG. THERE HAD BEEN MULTIPLE RECALLS ON MY CAR INCLUDING \"ENGINE SENSOR KIT\" AND \" ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM\". I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST YOU TO LOOK IN TO THIS MATTER SO AS TO CONTAIN FURTHER DAMAGE TO PRECIOUS LIVES OF PEOPLE AT LARGE.

THE QR25DE IS IN THE 2002-PRESENT NISSAN ALTMAN 2.5, 2.5S, 2.5SL 175HP, HYBRID 158HP. THE QR25DE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN ITS SHORT LIFETIME. A VARIETY OF MECHANICAL FLAWS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS, RECALLS, REPAIRS, AND OUTRIGHT ENGINE REPLACEMENTS. VEHICLES WITH THE QR25DE MAY INGEST MATERIAL FROM A DAMAGED PRE-CATALYST RESULTING IN INCREASED OIL CONSUMPTION. THE PRE-CATALYST WAS REPLACED AT 79,000 MILES AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER REALIZE THE ENGINE WAS CONSUMING MORE OIL BUT NOTHING THAT SIGNIFICANT. I STARTED TO NOTICE MORE OIL BEING CONSUMED AT 117,000 CALLED NISSAN AND STARTED A FILE THEY SUGGESTED I TAKE THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER AND CHECK OUT THE PROBLEM. THE CAR BROKE DOWN AND I HAD IT TOWED TO NISSAN AND THEY LOOKED AT THE CAR AND TOLD ME THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WAS GONE AT 118,151 MILES AND IT WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF $825.65. AT THE SAME TIME THEY CHECKED FOR OIL LEAKS AND SAID THERE WERE NO LEAKS AND TOP OFF THE OIL AND TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN 1062 MILES BROUGHT IT BACK TO NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD IT WAS DOWN 3 QUARTS. THEY FILLED THE OIL BACK UP AND AFTER 261 MILES THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON BROUGHT IT BACK TO NISSAN AND FOUND IT TO BE DOWN 4 QUARTS AND WAS TOLD THE ENGINE WAS GONE.  UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMERS HAVE LET THE OIL RUN COMPLETELY DRY WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENGINE FIRE OR COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF ENGINE WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS REVIEWED THE CASE AND DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR A POOR DESIGN AND NISSAN IS LETTING MANY CONSUMERS IN MY SITUATION PAY FOR A NEW ENGINE. I LITTLE RESEARCH ON THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE WILL YIELD MANY MORE UNSATISFIED CONSUMERS. THE CAR HAD OIL CHANGES AT 3000 MILES INTERVALS.*TR",

THEY DID IT AND SAID COOLANT LEVEL IS LOW AND ENGINE CAP IS LEAKING PRESSURE SO NEED TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR CAP.

ON THE WAY HOME ONE DAY, AS I WAS GETTING ON THE INTERSTATE MY CAR SHUT OFF AT LOW SPEED. I REVIEWED MY PROBLEM ONLINE AND FOUND A RECALL FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP THINKING THAT THIS WOULD BE A FREE FIX, NOOOTTT! IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT MY VIN WAS NOT ON THE RECALL. I PAID ABOUT $300 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.   THIS YEAR I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. AROUND MAY I HAD MY ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON. MY BELT WOULD ALSO START TO RATTLE WHENEVER THE CAR WOULD BE STOPPED IN DRIVE WITH THE A/C ON. THIS WOULD NOT OCCUR WHEN THE CAR WAS IN PARK OR NEUTRAL, ONLY IN DRIVE. THE RATTLING WOULD GO AWAY ONCE THE CAR WAS MOVING, BUT AS SOON AS YOU STOP, THERE IT WAS AGAIN. IF YOU TURN THE A/C OFF WHEN YOU ARE STOPPED, THE RATTLING WOULD GO AWAY. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN. THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS HAVING TO REPLACE A BLOWN HEAD GASKET AND THE FRONT RIGHT ENGINE MOUNT. BOTH WERE REPLACED AT A COST TO ME FOR $1,300.00. THE NEXT DAY, MY ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT WAS THE CAT CONVERTER WITH O2 SENSOR THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THIS WAS FIXED FOR $1,000.00. OF COURSE MY BELT RATTLING PROBLEM WAS NOT REPAIRED YET. TOOK THE CAR BACK AGAIN AND AFTER SPENDING 2 HOURS AT NISSAN TALKING TO THE MECHANIC, HE SAID THAT TENSIONER PULLEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. AFTER $200.00, THE RATTLING PROBLEM IS STILL THERE.   I AM OUT OF IDEAS OF WHAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE WITH MY CAR TO STOP THE RATTLING NOISE, AND I THINK THE MECHANIC AT NISSAN FEELS THE SAME WAY.  BY THE WAY, MY SISTER HAS A 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA AND HER CAR IS THE DOING THE EXACT SAME RATTLING NOISE. THIS MUST BE A PROBLEM WITH NISSAN AND NOT WITH INDIVIDUAL CARS.

I HAVE SPENT OVER 26 MONTHS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO FIX MY CAR. I FIRST NOTICED AN OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM AT ABOUT 75,000 MILES. I KEEP UP WITH THE REQUIRED SERVICES ON MY VEHICLE AND I MAKE OIL CHANGES AT THE RECOMMENDED INTERVALS AT A MINIMUM, SO I TRIED ADDITIONAL OIL CHANGES AND OIL REFILLS. THESE EFFORTS DID NOT SEEM TO WORK; SO I REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, THE TWO CRANK POSITION SENSORS, THE PCV VALVE, FOUR COIL PACKS, TWO OXYGEN SENSORS, AND THE SPARK PLUGS. MANY OF THESE ITEMS WERE ON RECALL AND NISSAN SHOULD HAVE PAID FOR THEM, BUT I PAID FOR THEM.   I FOUND COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS WERE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES.  IN FACT, THERE ARE NOW REPORTS OF THE 2002/2003 ALTIMA'S ENGINES CATCHING ON FIRE BECAUSE OF THIS OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM. THIS RISK OF ENGINE FIRE PRESENTS A RISK FOR INJURY OR DEATH TO VEHICLE OCCUPANTS, ESPECIALLY SINCE PART OF THE PROBLEM INCLUDES NO WARNING THAT THE ENGINE IS RUNNING DRY.   NISSAN NORTH AMERICA HAS IT WITHIN THEIR POWER TO TURN THIS APPARENT FAILURE INTO A PUBLIC RELATIONS AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY SUCCESS STORY.  I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ASKED, WHICH INCLUDED MULTIPLE OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS.  WHEN THESE TESTS WERE BEING PERFORMED, I WAS TOLD THAT IF THEY CRACKED THE ENGINE AND DID AN ENGINE INSPECTION TO PROVE THE ENGINE WAS WELL MAINTAINED, I WOULD RECEIVE A NEW ENGINE.  THE LOCAL HUNTSVILLE DEALERSHIP CRACKED THE ENGINE AND STATED IT WAS THE CLEANEST THEY EVER SAW.  WHEN NISSAN NORTH AMERICA WAS INFORMED OF THIS THEY DECLINED MY REQUEST FOR A NEW ENGINE OR ANY ASSISTANCE.  AFTER PRESSING THE NISSAN AGENT AS TO WHY, HE SAID IT WAS A BUSINESS DECISION AND NISSAN NORTH AMERICA COULD NOT AFFORD TO REPLACE EVERYONE'S ENGINE.  *TR",

THERE IS A RECALL IN CANADA FOR THE PROBLEM, BUT NOT IN US.  IN SPEAKING WITH A REPRESENTATIVE FROM NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS, I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THE REASON FOR THE RECALL BEING RECOGNIZED IN CANADA BUT NOT IN THE U.S. IS DUE TO THE FACTORY IN WHICH VEHICLES WERE PRODUCED.  SEEMS TO ME THIS REASON IS RIDICULOUS IF THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING IN THE U.S. TOO!  SEE INFO BELOW:  TRANSPORT CANADA RECALL NUMBER 2003060. UNITS AFFECTED: 30589.   2002-2003: ON CERTAIN VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH THE 2.5 LITER ENGINE, THE EXHAUST PIPE HANGER PIN MAY CATCH DEBRIS FROM THE ROAD WHICH COULD BE IGNITED BY CONTACT WITH THE MAIN CATALYST. CORRECTION: DEALER WILL REMOVE THE PROTRUDING PORTION OF THE EXHAUST PIPE HANGER PIN. ALSO, CERTAIN OPERATING CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE THE PRE-CATALYST TO OVERHEAT AND DAMAGE THE CATALYST SUBSTRATE. IF SUBSTRATE PARTICLES ENTER THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER, THEY MAY SCORE THE CYLINDER WALLS, RESULTING IN INCREASED OIL CONSUMPTION. CORRECTION: DEALER WILL REPROGRAM THE ENGINE CONTROL UNIT TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PRE-CATALYST OVERHEATING. IF THE CONVERSION EFFICIENCY OF THE PRE-CATALYST HAS DETERIORATED, THEN THE CATALYST WILL BE REPLACED. THE ORIGINAL PRE-CATALYST WILL THEN BE INSPECTED FOR EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE TO THE CATALYST SUBSTRATE. IF DAMAGE IS PRESENT, THE VEHICLE ENGINE WILL BE REPLACED.   WHILE I HAVE BEEN OBSESSIVE ABOUT ENSURING MY VEHICLE IS SERVICED ROUTINELY, I HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED ENGINE FAILURE WHICH WILL RESULT IN HAVING TO REPLACE MY ENGINE.  I DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCES TO JUST DROP $2000 ON A NEW ENGINE!   MY CASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE HANDS OF A REGIONAL SPECIALIST (FILE # 6149122), BUT I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE OUTCOME OF THE REVIEW TO DATE.

OVERHEATING RESUMED AFTER REPAIRS IN ADDITION TO OVERHEATING, VEHICLE BEGAN PRODUCING WHITE SMOKE AS WELL AS MISFIRING UPON START-UP. COMPUTERIZED DIAGNOSTIC WAS THEN COMPLETED. DIAGNOSIS WAS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  REPAIR COST WAS QUOTED AT $2100 PLUS TAXES.  I DID RESEARCH ONLINE AND INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE BLOWN HEAD GASKET WASN'T ISOLATED TO ME ALONE AND THAT THERE ARE MANY 2002 NISSAN ALTIMAS THAT BLOW THE HEAD GASKET AROUND 70,000 TO 90,000 MILES. MANY CUSTOMERS APPEAR TO HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT NISSAN BUT COMPANY WILL NOT OWN UP TO APPARENT DEFECT WITH THE MODEL.  IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BLOW A VEHICLE'S HEAD GASKET AND IT IS UNFAIR FOR A MODEL TO HAVE SUCH A MAJOR DEFECT AND THE CONSUMERS HAVE TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY AND COST OF REPAIRING THE PROBLEM - A MAJOR ENGINE OVERHAUL.

THIRD GENERATION ALTIMA'S QR25DE 4-CYLINDER AND VQ35DE 6-CYLINDER ENGINES HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN AFFECTED BY A RECALL RELATED TO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE POWER VALVES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE BUTTERFLY VALVE. THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN P5202 - DOES NOT MENTION ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES FOR PRODUCTION YEARS W SAME DESIGN. THIS HAS LEFT SOME OWNERS AFFECTED BY THE PROBLEM WITH NO RECOURSE/REMEDY FOR WHAT IN SOME CASES HAS AMOUNTED TO CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE. THE POWER VALVE IS A SERIES OF FOUR PLATES IN THE QR25DE 4-CYLINDER AND 6 PLATES IN THE VQ35DE 6-CYLINDER ENGINES, ONE PER CYLINDER. THE PLATES OPEN AND CLOSE SIMULTANEOUSLY TO ALLOW MORE AIR INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER FOR INCREASED POWER. EACH PLATE IS HELD IN PLACE BY TWO SCREWS. THE SCREWS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO COME LOOSE AS WELL AS THE PLATES AND ARE THEN INGESTED INTO THE ENGINE VIA THE INTAKE PORTS. PROBLEM IS INITIALLY EXHIBITED BY SES(SERVICE ENGINE SOON) LIGHT COMING ON AND/OR BLINKING.  UPON OBD METER READING, CODE WILL BE P0304, OR SIMILAR WHICH IS RANDOM CYLINDER MISFIRE OR CYLINDER 4 MISFIRE.  ELECTRODE ON SPARK PLUG HAS BEEN BENT CLOSED AS A RESULT OF THE POWER VALVE RETAINING  SCREW VIBRATING LOOSE AND BEING INGESTED INTO THE ENGINE.  THE SCREW THEN BOUNCES AROUND IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER, HITTING THE SPARK PLUG AND BENDING THE ELECTRODE SHUT, PREVENTING SPARK IN THAT CYLINDER. ADDITIONALLY, THE SCREW(S) AND PART OF THE BROKEN PLATES, IN SOME CASES HAVE MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ENGINE AND INTO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, THUS CAUSING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TO PREMATURELY DISINTEGRATE AS WELL AS BECOME INGESTED INTO THE ENGINE. FOR SOME REASON, NISSAN NORTH AMERICA HAS DECIDED TO NOT REMEDY ALL VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THIS ADMITTED FLAW OBVIOUSLY, THIS COULD CAUSE ENGINE FAILURE AT THE WRONG PLACE AND THE WRONG TIME, RESULTING IN SERIOUS BODILY HARM AND/OR FATALITY.  *TR",

HE SAID WELL GIVE ME SOME TIME TO GO OVER THE INFO. THEY SAID ITS IN GREAT CONDITION, WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THE BATTERY\" AFTER IT ALWAYS ACTED AS IF IT WAS READY TO STALL.  I THEN CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS. I PLACED A COMPLAINT. I THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM NISSAN IN NEWBURGH THE NEXT DAY THAT THEY WOULD FIX THE CAR.

WELL HE TOLD THEM THAT IT HAS BEEN TWO DAYS SINCE THEY FIXED IT AND THE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT IS ON AND NOW THE CAR IS NOT GOING UP HILLS. THEY NEVER CALLED US BACK.

I HAD THIS RECALL DONE ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PROBLEMS.    NOW, I AND OTHER ALTIMA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING OIL CONSUMPTION.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHICH HAS NOW MESSED UP MY ENGINE AND BOTH NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    WHEN I QUESTIONED THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THE PREVIOUS RECALL, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LOOK FOR DAMAGE WHEN THE RECALL WAS DONE.  OBVIOUSLY NOT, SINCE NOW A NUMBER OF ALTIMAS ARE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM AFTER THE RECALL WAS DONE.    I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A FORMER ENGINEER THAT SAID THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DESIGN ISSUES WITH THE 2002 MODEL.    I HAVE ALSO FOUND ON THE INTERNET THAT THE CATALYLIC CONVERTER MAY BE LOCATED TOO CLOSE TO THE ENGINE WHICH IS CAUSING THE PROBLEMS.  SO IF IF THE ENGINE AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER WERE REPLACED, THE PROBLEM CAN START AGAIN.  SOME OWNERS WHO HAVE PAID FOR REPLACEMENT HAVE EVENTUALLY STARTING EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.

WELL AFTER SPENDING SIX GRAND ON FIXING MY CAR, MY MACHINE HAS INFORMED ME THIS IS ALL DUE TO  PLUGGED PCV VALVE BECAUSE THE TWO INLACE HOLES FOR THIS VALVE ARE SO SMALL THEY GET CLOGGED SO EASILY AND THE DISCHARGE FOR THE PCV VALVE BECOMES IN INTAKE AND TO TO THE SIZE OF THE DISCHARGES THE OILED IS GETTING PULLING INTO THE ENGINE AND WELL AS OTHER FLUIDS WHICH IS WHAT IS CAUSING THE FAILURE OF THE ENGINE AND DESTROYING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  I AM GIVING YOU THE DATE MY CAR FINALLY DIED. IT TOOK ME OVER A MONTH AND A 1/2 TO GET THIS FIXED AND IT IS STILL FAR FROM BEING FIXED.

I THEN PULLED INTO A BAKERY ON 3100 SOUTH AND HIGHLAND DRIVE WHEN I GOT OUT OF MY CAR I WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE SMELL OF GAS. THERE WAS A TRAIL OF GAS BEHIND MY CAR AND A LARGE PUDDLE UNDER MY CAR. AT THIS POINT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO, I WAS AFRAID TO START MY CAR SO I ASKED A GENTLEMAN AT BIG O TO COME AND LOOK AT MY CAR TO SEE IF I COULD START IT. THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT START IT NOT KNOWING WHERE THE GAS LEAK WAS AT.   I THEN CALLED THE DEALER SHIP AND THEY DID NOT SUGGEST DRIVING THE VEHICLE BUT HAVING IT TOWED DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE TOW COMPANY  PICKED ME AND MY CAR UP AT ABOUT 8:50. THE GENTLEMAN  TURNED ON MY CAR AND BACKED IT OUT OF THE PARKING SPOT TO PUT IT UP ON THE TOW TRUCK. THE MOMENT MY CAR WAS TURNED ON IT BEGAN TO LEAK GAS. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD TURNED ON A WATER FAUCET AND IT CREATED ANOTHER LARGE PUDDLE OF GAS IN THE PARKING LOT.   ONCE AT THE DEALER SHIP. I EXPLAINED TO SHANE AND NICK WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY CAR WHEN NICK SAID, \" I KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT. IT HAPPENED TO ANOTHER CAR THIS WEEK. BUT THAT ONE CAUGHT FIRE\" HE TOOK MY CAR BACK INTO THE SHOP AND ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER COME BACK OUT OF THE SHOP AND SHOWED MY GRANDFATHER AND MYSELF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE GAS LINE HAD \"FALLEN OFF AND THE GAS WAS SOAKING INTO MY BACK SEAT.\" IT HAD CREATED A TAR LIKE SUBSTANCE ON THE TANK AND ON THE FOAM OF MY SEAT AND THE SEAT WAS SOAKED FROM THE GAS.   I LEFT MY CAR WITH THE DEALERSHIP ALL DAY FOR THEM TO ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THE SEAT AND GET RID OF THE GAS SMELL.   AROUND 6PM THAT SAME NIGHT I WENT TO PICK UP MY CAR WITH MY ROOMMATE . WE WERE ABOUT 10 FEET FROM MY CAR WHEN WE BOTH COULD STILL SMELL THE GAS.   NEEDLESS TO SAY WITH THE WEATHER TURNING FROM SUMMER TO FALL AND GETTING COLDER THE GAS SMELL IS GETTING WORSE AND  THE DEALERSHIP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH HAZARD AND WILL NOT REPLACE MY BACK SEAT. *JB",

NISSAN USA IS ABSOLUTELY HIDING FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE VEHICLE!  THEY STARTED BY HIDING THE PRE -CATALYST INTERNAL DISINTEGRATION NOTIFICATION WITHIN A RECALL FOR A POTENTIAL EXHAUST PIPE HANGER PIN PROBLEM.

THERE IS NO SMOKE, SMELL, OR DRIPS.  THE OIL IS JUST GONE!  THE DEALER SAYS I NEED A NEW ENGINE AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  THEY DIRECTED ME TO NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS- THEY HAVE BEEN VERY SLOW TO RESPOND. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL REPLACE MY ENGINE SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY ENGINE SEIZING WHILE I AM DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY OR TURNING ACROSS IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC!

WHAT NISSAN WILL DO  IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS FROM OCCURRING, YOUR NISSAN DEALER WILL SHORTEN THE EXHAUST PIPE HANGER PIN. THE DEALER WILL ALSO REPROGRAM THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE DAMAGE TO THE PRE-CATALYST. IN ADDITION, THE DEALER WILL INSTALL HEAT SHIELDS ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM ON VEHICLES THAT DO NOT ALREADY HAVE THEM. THIS FREE SERVICE SHOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE HOURS TO COMPLETE, BUT YOUR NISSAN DEALER MAY REQUIRE YOUR VEHICLE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BASED UPON THE DEALER''S WORK SCHEDULE. THE PRE-CATALYST WILL BE TESTED TO ENSURE IT IS WORKING PROPERLY AND REPLACED IF NECESSARY. IF DAMAGE IS FOUND INSIDE THE PRE-CATALYST, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.

TOOK CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC.  REPLACED SPARK PLUGS AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAS COME ON AGAIN.  I BOUGHT 2 NISSANS IN 2002- 1 ALTIMA; 1-QUEST.  HAD OWNED A 1998 ALTIMA PREVIOUSLY.  THOUGHT NISSAN WAS A GOOD BRAND.  THOUGHT NISSAN WAS A GOOD COMPANY.  THOUGHT WRONG!  WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN PRODUCT AS LONG AS I LIVE.  HAVE TOLD EVERY PERSON I KNOW.  WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE UNTIL I GO TO MY GRAVE.  *NM",

HAD TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY STATED THAT THEY COULD START THE CAR JUST FINE AND THAT I HAD FLOODED THE VEHICLE. AGAIN RECOMMENDED TUNE-UP AND REPLACING SPARK PLUGS. (I HAD JUST REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS MYSELF) NEXT THING I KNOW...MY CAR WON'T RUN AND SITS IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. HAD TOWED TO INDEPENDENT AUTO REPAIR SHOP AND ADVISED ME THAT MY ENGINE WAS BLOWN AND NEEDED REPLACED DUE TO CAT CONVERTER. I MADE THE DEALERSHIP TOW THE CAR TO THEM AND THEY INFORMED ME OF THE SAME AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $5000 FOR A NEW ENGINE. THE SERVICE MGR. TOLD ME THAT NISSAN KNOWS THAT THIS WILL OCCUR,AND THAT WHEN THEY CONTACTED THE NISSAN REP THEY DECLINED TO REPLACE THE ENGINE DUE TO THE MILEAGE. I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND GOT A TOTAL RUN AROUND AND TOLD ME THAT MY MILEAGE WAS TOO HIGH AND THEY HAVE HAD NO OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE. BULL!!!

MY CAR RECEIVES REGULAR MAINTENANCE EVERY 3 MONTHS AND/OR 3,000 MILES (DOCUMENTATION CAN BE PROVIDED), IT NEVER SITS LONGER THAN 2 OR 3 DAY, AND IT'S DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY FOR MY WORK COMMUTE. TWICE MY CAR SUDDENLY WOULDN'T START WITHOUT WARNING. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS FIXED, WHICH WAS AROUND APRIL, THERE WERE SEVERAL RECALLS FOR MY CAR. ONE WAS FOR THE FUEL PUMP SCREEN AND THE ENGINE SENSOR THAT WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO NOT START OR SUDDENLY STOP RUNNING. THIS SECOND TIME (10-24-05), MY LOCAL MECHANIC SHOWED ME A 6-PAGE SERVICE TECHNICAL BULLETIN THAT WAS ISSUED BY ALLDATA FOR MY NON-STARTING PROBLEM. THE DOCUMENT SUGGESTED REPLACING THE STARTER, ADDING A NISSAN BRAND FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER AND/OR REPROGRAMMING THE COMPUTER TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS SECOND REPAIR WILL COST ME ABOUT $500 TO FIX WHEN I PICK UP MY CAR TOMORROW. I THOUGHT THE RECALL REPAIRS WOULD RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, BUT THOSE REPAIRS PROVED TO ONLY PROVIDE A TEMPORARY FIX, BUT NOT RESOLVE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM. SINCE THERE'S A SERVICE TECHNICAL BULLETIN ABOUT MY NON-STARTING ISSUE, 2 RECALLS RELATED TO THIS SAME PROBLEM,  AND I'VE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPEN TWICE, I THINK MY CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED. I'M FORTUNATE THAT I WASN'T DRIVING THE CAR WHEN IT STOPPED RUNNING OR THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPEN TWICE IN 6 MONTHS. IF MY CAR FAILS TO START TWICE IN 6 MONTHS AND THE RECALL REPAIRS DON'T REMEDY THE PROBLEM, THEN THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I'D HATE TO FIND OUT IN A FEW MONTHS THAT THE $500 START REPLACEMENT WASN'T THE CULPRIT, BECAUSE I'D BE BACK AT SQUARE ONE. PLEASE TELL ME HOW I CAN GET THIS ISSUE ESCALATED TO A RECALL STATUS OR WHAT I CAN DO TO PREVENT A 3RD FAILURE. THANK YOU, JENNY R. BAKER. *JB",

I TOOK IT TO NISSAN THE NEXT MORNING AND THEY SAID THAT BOTH OF THE SCREWS BACKED OUT OF ONE OF THE BUTTERFLY VALVE PLATES IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE PLATE ITSELF AND THE SCREWS HAD FALLEN INTO THE ENGINE, THUS CAUSING SEVERE MISFIRING AND BANGING INTO THE SPARK PLUGS AND DESTROYING THEM AND ALSO SCORING ALL THE WALLS OF THE ENGINE.  NISSAN SAID I WOULD NEED TO BUY A NEW ENGINE BUT I REFUSED AND TOWED IT ANOTHER NISSAN DEALER AFTER TALKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER THERE AND HE SAID HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP MORE.  IT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE EVER SINCE BECAUSE I REFUSE TO PAY.  THE SERVICE TECH SAID THAT ALL 8 OF THE SCREWS HOLDING THE BUTTERFLY PLATES IN WERE ALL LOOSE.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO APPLY THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF LOCTITE TO THE SCREWS SO THEY DON'T ENCOUNTER THE SAME PROBLEM.

PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER BECAUSE IF I HAD BEEN CROSSING AN INTERSECTION AND THE ALTIMA HAD STALLED ONCOMING TRAFFIC COULD HAVE KILLED ME.  THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A SMALL PROBLEM AND NISSAN NEEDS TO ADDRESS IT.  I HAVE TAKEN SOME OTHER STEPS ALREADY ON MY END TO GET NISSAN TO ACCEPT FAULT, BUT PLEASE FOR MY SAKE AND OTHER OWNERS SAKE THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

HE SAID, \"SEE THERE IS NONTHING WRONG.\"  AFTER EXPLAINING THAT HE NEEDED TO LET THE CAR SET FOR A WHILE AND THEN TRY TO START IT, HE SAID THAT IT IS STILL GOING TO START.AFTER SITTING FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS, I ASKED THE SERVICE MAN TO STEP OUTSIDE AND LETS GIV THE CAR A START... TO NO SUPRISE, WHEN I TURNED THE KEY THE CAR PUTTERED, SPITTED, JERKED, AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT STARTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THE NEXT MORNING THAT THERE WAS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE CATALYST THAT WAS JUST REPLACED DUE TO A RECALL.",

THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE BACKSIDE HOUSING HAD MELTED AND I NEEDED A NEW HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE LIGHT/BULB REFLECTS OFF OF THE BACK OF THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY AND SHINES OUT.  APPARENTLY, THE HEAT FROM THE LIGHT/BULB HAD GOTTEN SO HOT IT MELTED THE BACKSIDE HOUSING (WHERE IT IS GROUNDED).  THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL IF THIS WILL HAPPEN TO MY OTHER HEADLIGHT, WHETHER IT WILL HAPPEN TO MY NEW HEADLIGHT, OR IF IT WILL HAPPEN TO BOTH LIGHTS.  IN MY MIND, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  ALSO, I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO THIS HAS HAPPENED TO (ACCORDING TO TWO DEALERS).  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE BULB COULD GET SO HOT AS TO MELT SOMETHING ELSE IN THE CAR.  I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW CARS ARE ASSEMBLED AND ABOUT CAR ENGINES, BUT WHAT IF THE HEAT FROM THE BULB COULD MELT FURTHER INTO THE CAR, OR EVEN START A FIRE?  THE CHANCE OF MORE DAMAGE TO A CAR OCCURRING FROM A HOT LIGHT BULB SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  IT SEEMS THERE IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE LIGHT OR OF THE MATERIALS USED.  I THINK THE 2002 AND 2003 ALTIMAS HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY AND NISSAN CHANGED THE HEADLIGHTS IN LATER MODELS.  I NO LONGER LEAVE MY AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT SWITCH ON FOR FEAR OF THE BULB GETTING TOO HOT.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND, IF THERE IS A FLAW, GET NISSAN TO TAKE CARE OF IT.",

THIS SEEMS OUT OF LINE TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HAD TIRES WEAR TO THE POINT THAT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACE TO PUT MY CAR IN ALIGNMENT.  I BELIEVE THESE TIRES SHOULD WEAR (THEY GET NORMAL HIGHWAY AND NEIGHBORHOOD USE) FOR AT LEAST 45K-50K BEFORE NEEDING TO BE REPLACED.      WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?*AK",

THE DEALER CLAIMS THE MASS AIR FLOW (MAF) SENSOR WAS AT FAULT.  ALTHOUGH THE MAF SENSOR WAS REPLACED, I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE COMPONENT THAT DISABLED THE VEHICLE ON THIS DATE.  THE ENGINE SHUTDOWN WITHOUT FIRST GOING INTO \"LIMP\" MODE.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL FOR THE CRANK POSITION SENSOR (CPS).  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THERE WAS AN OPEN RECALL ON THE CPS.  I DID NOT HAVE IT REPLACED PRIOR TO MY DRIVE BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  THE CPS WAS REPLACED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MAF.  WHAT PROMPTS THIS COMPLAINT IS THE MAF SENSOR.  THE VEHICLE IS NOW ON THE THIRD MAF.  THE FIRST ONE WAS REPLACED ON 8/2003.  THE SECOND MAF WAS REPLACED ON 1/14/2004, WHICH LASTED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS.  THE FAILURE MODE FOR THE FIRST MAF SENSOR ALLOWED WARNING: THE ENGINE DID NOT SHUT OFF, BUT INSTEAD LIMITED THE ENGINE SPEED TO 2500RPM.

I TRIED STARTING THE CAR SUNDAY AND AGAIN TODAY AND NOTHING HAPPENED.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK CAME THE TOW  GUY SAID THE CAR SOUNDED FLOODED.
