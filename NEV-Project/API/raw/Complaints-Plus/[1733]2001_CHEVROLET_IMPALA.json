I HAVE BEEN TO SEVERAL REPAIR SHOPS WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAR SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE. THE CAR IS RUNNING PERFECT EXCEPT FOR THIS ISSUE. I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE IS DUE TO THE IGNITION RECALL. I HAVE READ THE REPORTS CONCERNING THIS RECALL AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO MODIFY THE KEY BUT I WOULD LOOK INTO OTHER OPTIONS SINCE THIS HAS NOT FIXED THIS ISSUE. THEIR IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE CAR ACCORDING TO 4 REPAIR SHOPS AND 4 DIAGNOSTIC SCANS THAT HAVE BEEN RAN ON THE VEHICLE. WHILE DRIVING, THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF, IT WILL RESTART WITHOUT ANY ISSUES BUT THIS IS BECOMING DANGEROUS FOR MY CHILDREN AND I TO BE DRIVING IN. THEIR IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING ON WHEN THIS WILL OCCUR SO I HAVE NO WAY TO PREPARE FOR THIS ISSUE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION SO YOU MAY LOOK INTO THIS RECALL ONCE AGAIN.

MCGHEE, THE OWNER OF MCGHEES AUTO SHOP, HE DID A THOROUGH JOB OF COMBING ALL THE INTRICATE WIRES TO DETERMINE FINALLY AN INTERMITTENT DRAW OCCURRING FROM THE AMPLIFIER IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR.

A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD TO SPEND $140 ON A NEW BATTERY AFTER THE MECHANICS TOLD US THAT WAS THE STARTING PROBLEM. TWO DAYS LATER IT ONCE AGAIN WOULDN'T RESTART AFTER STOPPING AT THE STORE FOR A FEW MINUTES. THE MECHANIC CAME AND CHECKED THE CAR AND TIGHTENED THE BATTERY TERMINAL CONNECTIONS THINKING THAT WAS THE ISSUE. A FEW DAYS AFTER THE CAR WOULDN'T RESTART ONCE AGAIN AFTER A SHORT VISIT TO THE STORE. THAT TIME A TOW TRUCK DRIVER TRIED TO JUMP IT BUT IT WOULDN'T START, SO IT WAS TOWED TO THE MECHANIC. ONCE AT THE MECHANICS THE MECHANIC TRIED TO START IT AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. HE KEPT IT FOR TWO DAYS AND TRIED STARTING IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND EVERY TIME IT STARTED. SINCE BRINGING IT BACK HOME WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS ONCE AGAIN WITH IT NOT STARTING EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE AND THE BATTERY TERMINALS ARE TIGHT.

THESE PROBLEMS CONSISTED OF HEADLIGHTS FLICKERING ON AND OFF RANDOMLY, INTERMITTENT TURN SIGNAL FAILURE, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER ELECTRICAL RELATED ISSUES. DOING MINIMAL RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET SHOWS THAT MANY CONSUMERS HAVE OR ARE SUFFERING FROM THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE CLAIMS ARE (TEMPORARILY?) SOLVED BY REPLACING THE BODY CONTROL MODULE IN THESE VEHICLES. AFTER REPLACING MY BODY CONTROL MODULE AT THE DEALER ($600), THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF THE REPAIR. I PRESUME IT IS ALSO RELATED TO A FAULTY BODY CONTROL MODULE SINCE THAT IS WHAT MANY VOICES ON THE INTERNET SAY TO CHECK. I CALLED MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AND ASKED ABOUT ANOTHER REPLACEMENT, AND THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST 170$ JUST TO LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAID IT WAS INSTEAD RELATED TO AN AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE (MORE ELECTRICAL). THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN MY FAMILY SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW, AND HAS EXPERIENCED A VARIETY OF ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, MOST OF WHICH WENT AWAY AFTER REPLACING THE BODY CONTROL MODULE. AFTER REPLACING THE BCM, SOME HAVE COME BACK ALREADY. PLEASE PUT A STOP TO THIS! IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT NIGHT AND HAVE MY HEADLIGHTS SUDDENLY STOP WORKING OR TURN SIGNALS THAT ARE UNRELIABLE AT BEST OR AN AIRBAG THAT FAILS TO LAUNCH DURING AN ACCIDENT. THE SYMPTOMS SEEM TO GET WORSE THE OLDER THE BODY CONTROL MODULE, AND I CAN SEE IT HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN NOW THAT MY AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AFTER REPLACING MY BODY CONTROL MODULE.",

I ACTUALLY HAD TO FIGHT WITH THE STEERING WHEEL TO PROCEED WITH MY TURN. THIS PROBLEM OCCURS EVERY TIME I MAKE A SHARP TURN LEFT OR RIGHT , WHETHER I'M TURNING SLOWLY OR NOT , AND I BELIEVE SOME ONE IS GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY HURT BY THIS PROBLEM IF ITS NOT CORRECTED. IT WASN'T UNTIL 2MONTHS AGO I FOUND OUT THAT IF YOU TURN THE TRACTION OFF THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENS BUT NOT AS BAD AND THAT IT HAD SOME THING TO DO WITH PART#10340313 AND PART#10340314 WHICH IS THE ABS HARNESS WHICH CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED THROUGH THE DEALER OR ON GMPARTSDIRECT.COM.

MY CAR IS NOT COVERED UNDER THIS CAMPAIGN BUT THE PROBLEM DESCRIBE IN THE CAMPAIGN IS EXACTLY WHAT HAS FAILED IN MY SITUATION.  -  THE SHOP REPLACED THE RIGHT FRONT HUB BEARING AND WIRING HARNESS USING HUB KIT 6.307 AND SENSOR KIT 4.720  -PROBLEM WAS FIXED  - I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY CARS ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE CAPAIGN LIKE TRUCKS AND SUV'S THAT HAVE THE SAME SPEED SENSOR.*JB",

I DROVE THE CAR ONE DAY  AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE, THEN THE NEXT WEEK WHEN I DROVE THE CAR, EVERYTIME THAT I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE, THERE WAS THIS TERRRIBLE SCRAPING, NOISE, EVEN AFTER THE CAR HAD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  IT WAS SO LOUD THAT EVERYONE ON THE STREET AND IN CARS NEXT TO ME WAS TURINING TO LOOK AT MY CAR TO SEE WHERE THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM.  I FEARED STEPING ON THE BRAKE AND WAS NOT SURE THAT I COULD GET THE  CAR AND MYSELF HOME SAFELY.  ON 8/30.05, LIZ CRENSHAW, THE CONSUMER REPORTER FOR  CHANNEL 4, NBC NEWS REPORTED AND IT WAS ALSO IN THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSPAPER ON 8/31/05 THAT GM HAD RECALLED PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUV, 1999-2002,  BECAUSE OF CORROSION OF THE BRAKES.  IT STATED THAT THE NHTSA HAD OPENED THE INVESTIGATION IN APRIL OF MORE THAN 1.2 GM PICKUPS AND SUV'S IN 20 STATES BECAUSE OF QUESTIONS OVER THE ANTILOCK BRAKES.  THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR. I E-MAILED CHEVROLET AND A DUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER CALLED ME AND DENIED  EVEN KNOWING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A STUDY AND RECALL.  SHE (HEATHER VOLTZ) SAID  THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL WITH REGARD TO SENSORS BUT NOT CORROSION OF THE ABS.  SHE WASNTED ME TO SEND HER ALL THE INFORMATION AND I SUGGESTED SHE COULD GO TO YOUR WEBSITE AND READ IT THE SAME AS I DID.  SHE IS NOW WAITING FOR ME TO SEND HER THE COPY OF THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FROM THE WASHINGTON POST, WHICH SHE COULD ALSO  LOOK UP ON THEIR WEBSITE.  I AM GOING TO SEND THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE.  I DO NOT LIKE  BEING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BECAUSE I HAVE A CAR AND NOT AN SUV OR PICKUP.  THE CORROSION HAPPENED TO THE CAR THE SAME AS TO THE SUV'S AND PICKUPS.  WHY SHOULD OWNERS OF SUV'S AND PICKUPS GET THE BENEFIT OF THE RECALL WHEN I HAVE TO PAY FOR MINE WITHIN THE SAME YEARS AS THOSE RECALLED?  MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME DEAL WITH CHEVROLET.  THANK YOU.",

IT CAUSED STATIC IN THE RADIO.A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THIS WAS STILL A PROBLEM BUT NOW THE BATTERY/SECURITY/SERVICE VEHICLE SOON LIGHTS CAME ON IN THAT ORDER REPEATEDLY. I TOOK MY CAR TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC. HE SAID THAT THE RD PROBLEM WAS KNOWN BUT HE COULD NOT FIND THE REASON WHY THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE COMING ON. HE CHECKED ALL CONNECTIVITY, FUSES, GROUND CONTIUITY,ETC TO NO AVAIL. HE RESET THE COMPUTER CODE + FELT THIS MIGHT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE NO SOONER LEFT HIS PARKING LOT + THE WARNING LIGHTS CAME BACK ON. HE CHECKED IT AGAIN, AND SURE ENOUGH, NOTHING APPEARED TO BE WRONG. HE SAID THE PROBLEM MAY ACTUALLY BE IN THE 'BODY CONTROL MODULE' ITSELF BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE CHECKED OUT. HOWEVER, HE DID INFORM ME THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO CHECK THE BCM + THAT EVEN THE DEALERS HAD NO WAY OF CHECKING IT. SO NOW I'M SPENDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX A PART ON THE CAR THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE PROBLEM.

I FEEL THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY TO GET THIS FIXED. ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, IF I WANT ONSTAR BACK IN MY CAR ITS ANOTHER $400.00. THIS UPSET ME BECAUSE IKNOW THE PRICE OF THIS FEATURE WAS ALREADY BUILT INTO THE PRICE OF THE CAR SO IF I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT I HAVE TO PAY FOR REINSTALLATION.THIS IS WRONG. I BELIEVE THE REAR DEFOG PROBLEM IS A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM AND IF IT ALSO EFFECTS ONSTAR I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AND GIVE ME A REAL ANSWER ON THIS PROBLEM...THE PROBLEM THAT THIS VEHICLE HAD IS KIND OF UNHEARD OF IN THE EARLY STAGE OF MILEAGE AND AGE.. THE DEALERSHIP WAS EVEN CONFUSED ON THE PROBLEM, ALL COMPUTERS THAT THE CAR WAS PLACED ON BY DIFFERENT SHOPS SHOULD NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR, UNTIL IT WAS PUT ON A FLAT BED AND TAKEN TO THE DEALER.... I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME IN THIS MATTER....     *NLM",
