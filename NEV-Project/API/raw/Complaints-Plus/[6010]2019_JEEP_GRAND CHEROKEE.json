        "summary": "I have a 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk currently around 33,500 miles. I bought this vehicle new and have been having issues with it since I got it.  I hear electrical crackling and popping throughout the cabin, mostly in the dashboard. I thought at first it was the adaptive cruise or forward braking system engaging, but the sound seems to be completely random.  A common symptom is the speakers, microphones, and speaker-based safety alerts are completely cut out. If I'm on a call, the person on the other end will not be able to hear me until the speakers come back. Some of the systems that do not work as intended include:  -- Radio/SiriusXM/Apple Carplay/Android Auto (No sound) -- Uconnect Voice Command (No Sound/Mic) -- Parking sensors (no proximity alerts) -- USB Ports (slow charge and do not recognize phones) -- Forward Collison Alerts (No Sound) -- Navigation Alerts (No Sound) -- Blind Spot Alerts (No Sound)  I've tried the system with the following phones (with OEM and high-quality aftermarket wires) on AT&T, Verizon, Mint:  -- iPhone XS -- iPhone 12 -- iPhone 13 Pro Max -- Samsung Galaxy Note 8 -- Samsung Galaxy Note 20 -- Samsung Galaxy Note 22 -- Samsung Z Flip  My Jeep has the Panasonic Uconnect system. I've attached pictures of the type & IMEI etc.   This issue causes a direct safety concern when an alert doesn't activate or a when the loud electronic distortion comes through the speakers that will cannot be turned off\u2014causing me to have to pull over and turn the car off for the sake of my hearing.",

I backed out of the driveway and then my son said there is smoke coming out of the center counsel.  I pulled over and looked in the counsel and saw a fire.  Ran to the house and got a fire extinguisher to put it out.  Fire was out out for a short time, but then burst into an all out fire.  The car burnt to the ground.  Nothing remained.  So far the insurance company and Chrysler cannot pinpoint what caused the fire.  It is a total loss and the damage was too extensive to determine the cause.  My son and I are very lucky we got out of the vehicle in time and everyone was safe.  The vehicle was a lease and had only been serviced for oil changes by our Chrysler dealer.  No alarms or visual indicators forewarned us that anything like this was going to happen.  The vehicle is a total loss and we don't know why it caught on fire.  Chrysler denies any form of responsibility.  Just looking for answers and hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",

I was able to reduce the speed, turn on the emergency lights, tested the brake and then take the exit into the feeder and stopped and turned off the car. I called the River-Oaks Chrysler-Jeep service unsuccessfully.  I waited 15-20 minutes and then turned on the car to see that the engine sign was on, this was not the first time that I've got this sign and even received emails with a warning for which the car was taken accordingly for service and I was told by the advisors that if the engine sign was on, the car was drivable but if it was blinking it was not drivable.  One time, after having one of these situations with the engine warning light on, the next available day I brought the car for service and because the light was already off, I was told that the system might have reset and that no action was needed at that time.  I decided to proceed my trip given that the steering wheel felt that is was back to normal, tested the brakes and  drove to my destination, using the feeders and at very low speed. The next morning I called the Jeep service and talked to the advisor (Mr. Fernandez) over the phone, explained what happened and he reassured me that I could safely drive the car back to the dealer given the fact that the engine light was on but not blinking.  Car was dropped for service on June 22, after being parked for those days. The ABS module was reported to have an internal failure and it was replaced. This has been a repetitive event but this last time was critical in terms that I lost confidence in this vehicle. The administration at this dealer is fully aware of these events.",

There was no warning, no error lights or codes or anything.  I tested the brakes and they still worked.  I was able to coast to a stop on the breakdown lane.  I waited about 20 seconds and restarted the car and everything worked again.  This is my son's car that I was driving and it's really concerning because I thought I bought a safe car for him.  I'm an experienced driver, but either way it's extremely dangerous.  I looked information up about this issue and I guess it's been happening quite a bit according to the internet.  Someone mentioned that the 4 PCM torx head t15 mounting screws that hold the PCM faceplate to the protective metal case where the circuit board is housed are too long. (Not the 3 bolts that hold the PCM to the mounting bracket) When there was a vibration or shift, the screws touched the circuit board shorting everything out and causing the engine to stall. The owner put washers with the 4 little t15 screws and were able to fix the problem.  I think there needs to be a recall.  I'm afraid to drive the car myself or have my son drive it.  I'm taking it to the dealer, but I don't think they'll be able to recreate the situation.",
