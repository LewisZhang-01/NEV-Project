There are TSBs related to this for the 8 speed transmission, but dealer stated no known TSBs exist for the 6 speed. The truck is currently in the shop getting the torque convertor replaced and should be available for pick-up in the upcoming week.  Rumble strip sensation occurred under light throttle acceleration and presented more frequently on an incline. There were occurrences on flat ground, but this was not as common. The vibration occurred most often at highway speeds of around 70 MPH, but also occurred several times in the ranges of 20-30 and 40-50 MPH. Tachometer reading during these occurrences was around 1,500 - 2,000 RPM. Issue was intermittent and would come and go. Most of the time the sensation was mild, but periodically the vibration would be severe enough the driver felt like he had been rear-ended.   A separate symptom would occur while going up hills and the tachometer would bounce up and down approximately 300 RPMs with a noticeable surging sensation. When presenting, the vehicle would surge forward every few seconds until the hill had been crested. This only occurred at highway speeds with cruise set and would not present when the rumble strip vibration was present.",

I ended up calling gm roadside assistance and they sent a tow truck to pick us and the truck up. The truck wouldn't engage into drive nor reverse. Once towed to the dealership, Gene Messer Chevrolet, in Lubbock, Texas, a service tech mentioned that a ton of the lifters bending push rods are going out on the late 2019, 2020 model silverado due to cheaper lifters added to the vehicles due to Covid shortage supplies. In essence, they wanted to get these models out with no regard to safety of the consumer. I'm not pleased with the craftsmanship GM has lined out on these trucks, this could've ended way worst. They jeopardized my families safety for profits. Right now the truck is still awaiting diagnostics still won't drive nor reverse per dealer service tech. It's just a terrible situation, the truck is new only has 25,500 miles on it, this needs to be recalled.",

Finally I was able to get it to move forward a bit better and was heading directly for the dealership but since the power just was not getting to the wheels (transmission?) I pulled over and shut off the truck for a few minutes. Upon starting the truck again, it seemed to move forward better after that but had the 'check engine light' illuminated.

        "summary": "The infotainment screen brightness is set too high, such that turning the brightness setting down enough for the infotainment screen to not be too bright turns the backlighting on the instrument cluster down to where it's almost unreadable. In this specific case I was trying to use Apple Maps through Carplay for navigation in an unfamiliar rural area, where lighting on the roads is almost inexistent besides in towns. During the day it's not too much of an issue, but any time between dusk and dawn one must make a choice between visibility out the windshield and being able to quickly read anything on the instrument cluster. It is my opinion that this issue is enough of a safety hazard to force GM to make changes, but unfortunately isn't the most egregious \"feature\" of this screen. That title belongs to what happens when you put the vehicle in reverse at night. It seems whoever designed it thought the view of the backup camera on the infotainment screen is the only thing you should be able to see, since it changes the brightness back to its daytime setting. This makes seeing out of the vehicle in any direction where the screen is even slightly in your view almost impossible. It also means you must wait a second or two for your eyes to adjust if you want to, for example, look at the backup camera on the screen then look out the rear window. In my case, even looking out the rear window into a garage with a light on was difficult after looking at the backup camera view. Add to all of this any kind of vision issues like needing prescription glasses or contacts, and your eyes are constantly trying to adjust between being able to see what your next turn might be and being able to read any signage that may be present. Simply put, it seems GM took the idea of making the vehicle a rolling smart device to be the primary use, even above having the ability to see where you're going safely.",

Once I was able to return home, I pulled the breakaway pin on the trailer and all brakes worked perfectly fine. I then pulled all the hubs on the trailer axles and found one brake magnet had wore down to the coil. Obviously this is an issue and needs to be replaced, but the fact that my truck cut break output to all the brakes completely is very dangerous and unacceptable.   This is a serious safety issue since there is nothing that can be done while on the road to fix this. If I had been traveling in the mountains as I will be next week, this could easily have caused a much more serious situation.   This situation has been discussed among other owners of the same vehicle who experienced the same situation. There is a message that comes up on the DIC, but at that point it\u2019s too late since the trailer brakes are already turned off by the vehicle.   It seems to me that unless there is a serious short or the truck senses and extremely high amperage overload that it should continue work and send brake power to a trailer even if there is one single component that fails. That is the way that brake controllers have worked since they were invented, and now this new \u201cIntegrated Trailer Brake Controller\u201d is much less safe.",

Started my 2020 1500 Silverado in the parking lot and went about 75 feet to the launch and retrieved the boat.  While I was retrieving the boat, I left the Silverado motor running.  After boat pickup, drove about 75 feet in the lot to rig the boat for travel and shut off the Silverado engine.  After rigging was completed, started the truck and there was no power steering.  The following two messages were present on the DIC: \u201cservice power steering drive with care\u201d and \u201cservice ESC\u201d.  I can\u2019t believe that this truck with less than 2800 miles was exhibiting such a major problem.  Restarting the tuck multiple times did not clear the error messages.  Since I live about three miles from the lake, I decided to take a chance and drove home and left the truck in the street.  Called the dealer and made a service appointment. After about an hour, I went out and started the truck in an attempt to park it in the driveway.  The messages had disappeared and power steering was functional.  Also, I did some searching on the internet and found many other owners of 2020 1500 Silverado that had the exact same loss of power steering and messages that I had experienced.  The dealer informed me that although there were many communication error codes present, they were not able to find the cause of the problem.  They requested that I leave the truck with them and they will try to reproduce the power steering failure.  The dealer didn\u2019t seem to care, even after I mentioned that there were many others with identical problems and surely someone in Chevrolet engineering knows of the problem and how to fix it.  Their response was that they were not aware of any known documented problems like mine.  I think I\u2019m getting the run around.  They still have the truck after twelve days and no solution.

Immediately codes were thrown on the dash stating that the power steering was out and that the ESC system needed serviced. The traction control system/ESC light was also illuminated on the dash. I was unable to turn the steering wheel whatsoever. I turned the vehicle off and restarted approximately three times all of which still were displaying the codes listed above.  I let the truck sit for approximately 20 minutes and the codes had cleared themselves and the vehicle was functioning as it should. I immediately drove to the dealership and had it serviced. Dealership stated there was a programming issue related to the EBCM, which if I'm not mistaken was a recall already issued for the 2019 models.   I have seen many instances online of this same issue occurring and sometimes impacting the ability to brake (if vehicle was in motion at time of onset). My onset occurred at approximately 14,000 miles while in park. Since the servicing (approximately 1 week) issue has not been replicated, but I am not sure if the problem has been fixed or if the computer is just functioning properly and will glitch again at some point in the future.",

GM AND NHTSA ARE BEING NEGLIGENT ON THIS AND I WILL GLADLY TESTIFY IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WILL BE SOME.
