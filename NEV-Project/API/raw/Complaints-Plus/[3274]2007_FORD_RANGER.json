THE RUST IS SO EXTREME THAT THE SPARE TIRE CARRIAGE UNDERNEATH COMPLETELY RUSTED OUT AND THE TIRE DROPPED TO THE GROUND. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENGINE (THE E-VAP?) HAD TO BE STRAPPED UP FOR FEAR IT WILL DROP TO THE GROUND AS WELL. 2 AUTO MECHANICS AND 2 DEALERS TOLD ME IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND WON'T PASS INSPECTION.

USUALLY, WHEN UNCLE SAM CALLS, THINGS GET DONE.  MY 2009 MERCURY MILAN HAS 15000 MILES ON IT, HAS NOT BEEN OUT OF THE GARAGE SINCE SEPT. 2017 BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.  I'VE BEEN TOLD BY FORD EMPLOYEES THAT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THE AIRBAG EXPLODING, BUT, THAT DOES LITTLE TO ASSUAGE MY FEAR.
