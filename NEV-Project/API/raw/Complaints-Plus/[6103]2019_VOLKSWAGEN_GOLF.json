VW has replaced the part under warranty 2 times since I purchased the vehicle. In my case the second time it happened the car popped out of gear and struck 2 cars across the street from my driveway. Dealer states its a common issue. But Volkswagen has done nothing to correct the issue other than replacing the hand brake repeatedly on the cars. It's a major safety issue in my opinion. And I feel they need to come up with a permanent solution rather than replacing with a new faulty part. I have since sold the car back to the dealer as I don't trust that the hand brake on the car won't fail again.",

SEEMED LIKE IT HAPPENED WHEN THE TACH WAS AT IDLE-RANGE. RESTARTED WITH BUTTON.    - 6-8-19 @ 10:56PM (225 MILES)  - NO CEL  - PULLING UP TO DRIVEWAY. CAR DIED AT LESS THAN 2MPH GOING UP A VERY SLIGHT HILL WHEN CLUTCH WAS DEPRESSED TO GO INTO FIRST FROM NEUTRAL. WAS GOING *VERY SLOW* WHEN THIS HAPPENED. RESTARTED WITH BUTTON.    - 6-9-19 @ 3:30PM (276 MILES)  - NO CEL  - BROTHER WAS DRIVING WITH ME IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. PULLING UP TO STOP SIGN IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND HE WAS IN NEUTRAL WITH CLUTCH OUT SLOWING TO A STOP AND THE CAR SOFTLY DIED AGAIN. RESTARTED WITH BUTTON.    - 6-9-19 @ 11:44PM (418 MILES)  - NO CEL  - DRIVING UP A STREET IN A NEIGHBORHOOD GOING 20-25MPH IN 2ND GEAR AND THE DISPLAY BETWEEN MY TACH AND SPEEDO SAID I WAS IN 3RD AND SHOULD SHIFT INTO 4TH. WHEN I CRESTED THE HILL AND HIT THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN FOR A PART OF THE STREET THAT WAS DAMAGED, THE GEAR DISPLAYED SWITCHED TO 2ND (WHICH IS WHAT I WAS IN AND HADN'T CHANGED).

THE STALLING SEEMS TO HAPPEN MORE AS I COME TO A STOP. IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS ALSO. I REALIZED THERE IS IN FACT AN ISSUE SO I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN 1 WEEK SO THEY CAN HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I WILL NOT BE DRIVING THE CAR UNTIL THE DEALERSHIP CLEARS IT AS SAFE TO OPERATE.   THE CAR IS A 2019 VW GTI 6 SPEED MANUAL SHIFT.  THE STALLS STARTED WHEN THE CAR HAD ABOUT 400 MILES, TODAY IT STALLED FOR ABOUT THE 8TH OR 9TH TIME AND HAS ABOUT 1125 MILES.
