        "summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NEW DESIGN OF SCHOOL BUS ESCAPE WINDOWS.  IN THE PAST, THESE WINDOWS WERE HINGED ALONG THE TOP AND SWUNG OUT FROM THE BOTTOM.  THE NEW DESIGN IS HINGED ON THE FRONT AND THEY SWING OUT FROM THE BACK.  I FEEL THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SMALL CHILDREN WHO MAY ACCIDENTALLY RELEASE THE LATCH, OPEN THE WINDOW AND FALL OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUS TO THE GROUND BELOW.      I PICTURE A SCENARIO WHERE A SMALL CHILD MAY STAND UP ON THE SEAT ( YES I KNOW THEY SHOULD NOT STAND UP ON THE SEAT BUT YOU CANNOT PREDICT THE ACTIONS OF A 3 OR 4 YEAR OLD CHILD) TO TRY TO PUT THE WINDOW DOWN.  HIS SLEEVE CATCHES THE RELEASE ON THE WAY UP AS IT DOES RELEASE FROM THE BOTTOM UP.  THE WINDOW FLIES OPEN.  HE IS ALREADY IN AN OFF BALANCE POSITION SO OUT THE WINDOW HE GOES.  NOW LETS IMAGINE THE BUS IS GOING AROUND A CORNER.  YES AN ALARM WILL SOUND ALERTING THE BUS DRIVER BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO STOP AND SECURE THE BUS, GET OUT OF HIS SEAT AND GRAB THAT CHILD BEFORE HE GOES OUT THE WINDOW?  I DON'T THINK SO.    I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A TETHER BE ATTACHED TO THESE WINDOWS TO RESTRICT THE OPENING TO ABOUT 6\".  SAID TETHER WOULD BE DESIGNED TO BREAK @ A PREDETERMINED FORCE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.    I AM JUST TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE HERE BUT IF IT TAKES A TRAGIC ACCIDENT TO OPEN UP SOME EYES THEN SO BE IT.  I JUST HOPE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN ON ONE OF OUR BUSES.  *TR",
