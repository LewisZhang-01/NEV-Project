WHILE SLOWLY PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE TO PARK MY CAR, I  BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO A COMPLETE STOP, ABOUT TO SHIFT INTO PARK, WHILE MY FOOT WAS STILL DEPRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO THROTTLE UP OVERPOWERING THE BRAKES CAUSING THE BACK WHEELS TO SPIN AND THE CAR TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HARDER I PUSHED DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE MORE IT THROTTLED UP UNTIL IT SHOT ME UP AND OVER THE CEMENT WHEEL STOP IN FRONT OF THE PARKING STALL AND ONTO THE GRASS MEDIAN AT WHICH TIME I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF AND SLAMMED THE SHIFTER UP INTO PARK. I WAS DUMBFOUNDED! I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEHOW WHEN MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, IT WAS ALSO CATCHING THE SIDE OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL THUS MAKING IT SEEM LIKE THE HARDER I PUSHED DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE MORE THE ENGINE WOULD THROTTLE UP AS WELL. I EVENTUALLY SHOOK IT OFF AND WENT ABOUT MY DAY. THREE DAYS LATER, WHILE PULLING INTO MY BROTHERS GARAGE AND AGAIN, COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP, IT THROTTLED UP AGAIN THE SAME WAY AND MY BROTHER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CAR. HE THOUGHT I WAS PLAYING UNTIL HE SAW THE PANIC ON MY FACE. HE NO SOONER JUMPED OUT OF THE WAY WHEN THE CAR SHOT FORWARD ALMOST HITTING HIM! THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN NEVER KNOWING WHEN OR WHERE.

LOOKED ONLINE FOR OTHERS HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND HUNDREDS OF POSTS, EVEN LAW SUITES AGAINST FORD. I NOTICED PEOPLE DESCRIBING THE ACCELERATOR STICKING OR GOING TO THE FLOOR.

MY FRIEND AND I HAD TRAVELED ABOUT 60 MILES N FROM SACRAMENTO TO AN AREA BETWEEN ALTA AND DUTCH FLATS AND I HAD TURNED OFF THE AC AND PUT THE WINDOWS DOWN.   I HEARD A STRANGE CRACKLING SOUND AND  I  PULLED OVER ABOUT A HALF A MILE AFTERWARDS AND SHUT OFF THE ENGINE,  WE SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING AND LIFTED UP THE HOOD.   AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE 2ND ALTERNATOR IT HAD LASTED ABOUT 1600 MILES.  THE SPARKS THAT WERE SHOOTING OUT OF THE ALTERNATOR LOOKED LIKE A 4TH OF JULY SPARKLER, AND WE'RE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. AND I'M  ON THE 3RD ALTERNATOR WITH LESS THAN 59000 MILES. TWO MONTHS LATER MAYBE 600 MORE MILES AND WATER FROM THE SPLIT IN THE WIPER COWLING RUNS  INTO THE CAR WHICH WENT UNNOTICED FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  I HAD STANDING WATER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD AND SOME IN THE REAR AS WELL.   MY REPAIR ESTIMATE OF ALMOST $600.00, PLUS A RENTAL CAR AND NOT INCLUDING PULLING THE CARPET AND HEATING THE FLOORBOARD AS RUST PREVENTION. MY FEELING IS IT'S NOT OVER YET AS I HAVE READ A LOT OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE. I HAVE NOTICED THE ENGINE HAS STARTED TO CRANK LIKE IT MIGHT NOT START.  FORD  POSTS RECORD PROFITS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO LOYAL CONSUMERS WHO JUST WANTED TO OWN THEIR PRETTY MUSTANG, AND PAID WELL FOR IT.  WE ARE REAL, WE HAVE LIVES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS IN REAL AND MEANINGFUL WAYS.......HELP US! LISTEN TO  US,  FOR EVERY PERSON THAT FOUND THEIR WAY TO THIS WEB SITE AND POSTED THEIR COMPLAINT THEIR ARE HUNDREDS OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS WHO AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF THIS PROCESS.  WE HAVEN'T GONE OUT AND CAUSED THIS DAMAGE TO OUR CARS, WE ARE NOT AT FAULT AND WE  DESERVE REMEDIATION.  PLEASE HELP.  *TR",

WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD PULL FORWARD AS IF SOMEONE WERE TOWING IT FROM THE FRONT. THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER THE CRUISE CONTROL HAD BEEN USED MINUTES OR HOURS PRIOR TO THE VEHICLE BEING SHUT OFF. ONCE THE CAR WAS TURNED ON AGAIN, EVEN AN HOUR LATER, WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO MAINTAIN ITS SPEED (USUALLY 10 MPH OR 15 MPH) UNTIL THE BRAKE WAS PRESSED EVEN THOUGH THE CRUISE CONTROL WASN'T ACTIVATED. THIS WAS SUPPOSEDLY \"FIXED\" BY FORD THROUGH A $600 \"REPAIR\" OF THE \"COMPUTER\" THAT CONTROLS THE THROTTLE (I HAVE DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT THIS REPAIR). I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS SITE. SO NOW I AM REPORTING THE FOLLOWING TERRIFYING INCIDENT. THIS 2006 FORD MUSTANG, ABOUT 2 YEARS PRIOR, HAD ITS CRUISE CONTROL ON WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED FROM 40 OR 50 MPH TO 60 TO 70 MPH. THE BRAKE SLOWED THE CAR BUT THE REVVING WAS OUT OF CONTROL. LUCKILY I WAS ON AN OPEN HIGHWAY AROUND 10PM BUT HAD TO DRIVE INTO A GAS STATION (LUCKILY NOTHING HAPPENED) AND SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AS THE ENGINE REVVED HITTING THE UPPER RPMS. I HAD TO SHUT OFF THE CAR WITH THE IGNITION (LEAVING IT IN THE PARK GEAR AND PRESSING THE BRAKE, MIND YOU!) AND WHEN TURNED ON THE CAR AGAIN (NOW IN PARK), THE CAR AGAIN, DANGEROUSLY REVVED. I THOUGHT THE ENGINE WAS GOING TO BLOW OUT. I SHUT OFF THE CAR AGAIN, PARKED STILL AT THE ENTRANCE OF THIS GAS STATION. I WAITED SOME MINUTES AND TURNED THE CAR ON AGAIN, SWEATING PROFUSELY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, AND THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL. I WAS CONVINCED THIS HAD TO DO WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL. I HAD AAA TOW THE CAR HOME AND THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT TO FORD WHO CLAIMED THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. THEY CHECKED THE COMPUTER AGAIN AND GAVE IT AN \"UPDATE\". I NEVER USED THE CRUISE CONTROL AGAIN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE RPMS OR ACCELERATION.   *TR",

IT BOUNCED OFF THE 1ST VEHICLE AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT I HAD PLACED BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKES, TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS STANDING ON THEM WITH MY HEAD HITTING THE ROOF OF THE CAR. THE CAR PROCEEDED ON (STILL IN FULL THROTTLE AND BRAKES APPLIED) AND SMASHED IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER VEHICLES FURTHER UP AND AFTER THAT COLLISION THATS WHEN THE CAR FINALLY HAD CAME TO A STOP. I NEVER HEARD OR SEEN ANY VEHICLE TAKE OFF ON ITS OWN LIKE THAT. TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT I HAD ASKED AROUND ON FACEBOOK ON SEVERAL MUSTANG ENTHUSIAST/CLUB PAGES AND NO ONE HAS HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING. A WEEK LATER MY INSURANCE COMPANY TOTALED OUT MY VEHICLE AND LEFT ME WITH NO CAR AND NOW I'M LEFT TO PAY $3000 DOLLARS DIFFERENCE ON MY LOAN AND $500 TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I ALSO ASKED ON FORD'S FACEBOOK PAGE AND I WAS GIVEN A NUMBER FROM A CUSTOMER RELATIONS REPRESENTATIVE. I HAD CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER HEARD OF THIS AND \"WHAT WILL I LIKE TO DO WITH THIS?\". A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME ABOUT CAR COMPLAINTS.COM AND I CAME ACROSS MORE THAN 20 COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. I ALSO WAS TOLD RECENTLY TO CHECK THIS WEBSITE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. I LOVED THAT CAR AND THAT WHOLE SITUATION LEFT ME DEPRESSED AND FRUSTRATED.  *TR",

THIS COMES AFTER AN EXTENSIVE WATER LEAK THAT CAUSED SERIOUS MOLD DAMAGE INSIDE THE CAR ALONG WITH ELECTRICAL ISSUES,ONE OF WHICH A NEW BATTERY WAS NEEDED. THIS WAS FIRST \"REPAIRED\" IN 5/2013 BUT WAS NOT REPAIRED BECAUSE IN 12/2013 THERE WAS A MASSIVE INTERIOR FLOOD WHICH LEAD TO A MASSIVE INTERIOR MOLD PROBLEM AND THE CAR ALSO WOULD NOT START AND WAS TOWED TO TWO SEPARATE DEALERSHIPS. NO ONE WANTS TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY AND THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA OUT THERE SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS EARLY AS 2007.

WELL, IN RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE THREADS HERE, ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HAS NOW POSTED THIS:     \"... IN FORD'S FACTORY SERVICE MANUAL UNDER THE SECTION ON REPLACING THE ELECTRICAL BOX ...(SJB) ... INSIDE THE PASSENGER SIDE KICK PANEL, FORD REFERS TO THE FOAM SHEET OVER THE SJB AS A \"WATERSHIELD\" AND CAUTIONS NOT TO REMOVE IT WHEN INSTALLING THE NEW BOX ...\"    IF THIS IS TRUE, AND IT SHOULD BE VERIFIED BY SOMEONE WITH ACCESS TO THE MANUALS [WHICH I DO NOT HAVE], HERE ARE THE FACTS:    FORD DESIGNS AND BUILDS A VEHICLE WITH AN ELECTRICAL BOX (SJB) LOCATED INSIDE THE PASSENGER CABIN OF THE VEHICLE. IN FACT, THE SJB IS NESTLED BETWEEN THE OUTER FENDER AND THE INTERIOR KICK PANEL.

THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DRIVEN OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS WITH NO IMPROVEMENT.

THIS DEFECT COULD RESULT IN A CRASH CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. FORD SHOULD RECALL AFFECTED VEHICLES AND HAVE THE DEFAULT IDLE SETTING SET FOR A HIGHER VALUE SO THE AIR CONDITIONER WHEN ENGAGED DOES NOT RESULT IN THE ENGINE STALLING. THE IDLE OF ENGINE IS ERRATIC WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER ON SINCE IT IS ENGAGING AND DISENGAGING DUE TO THE LOW IDLE SPEED < 500RPM. BY NOT USING THE AIR CONDITIONER THE IDLE SPEED WILL RETURN TO ITS NORMAL SPEED OF AROUND 600 TO 700RPM BUT STILL FLUCTUATES SLIGHTLY. NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE AIR CONDITIONER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH EAST. THE CONTROL FEED BACK OF THE IDLE SYSTEM IS INCORRECTLY OPERATING WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER LOAD ON IT. *TR",

WHILE STARTING TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY SHE NOTICED ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO END THE PASSING MANEUVER WHEN THE ENGINE ACCELERATOR \"STUCK\" WIDE OPEN.  THE PEDAL ITSELF HAD COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND NO MATTER WHAT SHE TRIED TO DO TO GET IT \"UNSTUCK\" THE ACCELERATOR REMAINED AT FULL THROTTLE.  FULL BRAKES WERE UNABLE TO SLOW THE CARS SPEED.  THE THROTTLE FINALLY RELEASED AFTER ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS OF FULL ACCELERATION AND SHE WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR BEFORE HITTING ANY OTHER VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY.  I HAVE CALL A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, NEVADA FORD AT (417)667-3385 OR (800)999-3368 AND ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT ANY SAFETY RECALLS OR INFORMATION ON THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE FROM FORD.  I JUST DID A QUICK SEARCH ON LINE AND FOUND SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT STICKING ACCELERATORS ON FORD MUSTANGS.  SHE BOUGHT THIS CAR USED FROM MILER-QUINN IN HARRISIONVILLE MISSOURI ABOUT FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF THIS YEAR AND HAS NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT UNTIL THIS.  NOW I BELIEVE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THE ORIGINAL OWNER DUE TO THE LOW PRICE MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE THE CAR FOR, $10,500.

FORD HAS RELEASED TSB 08-26-7 DETAILING THE PROBLEM FOR MODEL YEARS 2005 - 2009.  CONSIDERING SO MANY YEAR MODELS INVOLVED, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DESIGN FLAW IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE.
