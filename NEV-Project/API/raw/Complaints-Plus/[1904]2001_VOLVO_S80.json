I FINALLY - 9 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR - HAVE HAD TO GET IT FIXED - OVER $1200.00.

LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN NEUTRAL QUICK ENOUGH AND RESTART IT BEFORE I GOT HIT.  THE CAR ALSO SURGES DANGEROUSLY AT STOPS.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE 110%, THE CAR WOULD LURCH FORWARD AND HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF IT.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CAR I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER VOLVO.

CAR ALMOST STALLS WHEN IDLING IN BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC, REQUIRING YOU TO PRESS ON THE GAS TO KEEP IT FROM STALLING, BUT THIS MAKES THE CAR LURCH FORWARD EVEN MORE.  SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.        THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO A FAULTY ETM (ELECTRONIC THROTTLE MODULE) THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE NHTSA DEFECT INVESTIGATION SHOWN BELOW.  THE ETM IN MY CAR WAS REPLACED  TWO YEARS AGO AT 46K MILES BUT THE SAME SYMPTOMS ARE RECURRING.     NHTSA ACTION NUMBER : PE05041 NHTSA RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER : N/A   MAKE : VOLVO MODEL: S80   MANUFACTURER : VOLVO CARS OF N.A. LLC.  YEAR : 2001   COMPONENT : VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL   DATE INVESTIGATION OPENED : JULY 26, 2005   DATE INVESTIGATION CLOSED : OPEN    SUMMARY:    THE OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATION (ODI) HAS RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-ONE (131) CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ALLEGING A VARIETY OF CONCERNS RESULTING FROM FAILURE OF THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL MODULE (ETM) IN THE SUBJECT VEHICLES, INCLUDING A SUDDEN LOSS OF SPEED AND STEERING ASSIST WHEN DRIVING IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC AND SUDDEN AND COMPLETE STALL WITHOUT WARNING. IN SOME INSTANCES, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLES WOULD RESTART, AND IN SOME CASES THE VEHICLES WERE TOWED. SOME CONSUMERS ALLEGE THAT AFTER HAVING THE ETM REPLACED THE NEW COMPONENT FAILED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. A PRELIMINARY EVALUATION HAS BEEN OPENED TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE, FREQUENCY, AND POTENTIAL SAFETY-RELATED CONSEQUENCES OF THE ALLEGED DEFECT.   *JB",

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT VOLVO KNEW ABOUT THIS WHOLE ETM ISSUE IN 1998 BEFORE THE FIRST CARS WERE SOLD.  A REDESIGN TO ELIMINATE THE FAILURE PRONE POTENTIOMETER THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR WOULD HAVE FIXED THIS ISSUE.

THE FOLLOWING MSG APPEARED ON THE DASH, \"ENGINE PERFORMANCE REDUCED\".

THIS TIME, I MADE A CALL TO THE VOLVO DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME TO LEAVE THE CAR OFF FOR A MINUTE AND THE COMPUTER WOULD RESET. NOT A GOOD SOLUTION.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE HAD TO NAVIGATE THE CAR FROM THE INSIDE LANE TO THE EMERGENCY LANE WHILE TRAVELING NO FASTER THAN 20 MPH.

ALL THIS SAID, THE CAR FAILED APPROXIMATELY 8-10 TIMES BEFORE I COULD GET THE CAR TO THE SHOP AND REPAIRED ($933.00).  THE PROBLEM PART WAS DETERMINED TO BE AN ELECTRONIC THROTTLE MODULE.

A FORD ECONOLINE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TURNED LEFT WITHOUT SEEING ME AND HIT ME IN THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT WHEEL AND ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK. I BROUGHT MY BRAND NEW 2001 VOLVO S60 BACK TO MY DEALER BILL GRAY VOLVO FOR REPAIR. I GOT MY CAR BACK JUST LAST WEDNESDAY (4/18). THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS FIXED EXCEPT THE MOLDING ON THE WINDOW. WHILE I WAS DRIVING BACK HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED THE CAR WAS QUITE A BIT OFF-CENTERED WHEN I WAS ACCELERATING WHICH DIDN'T HAPPENED BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AND THE REPAIR. SO I CALLED BACK THE NEXT MORNING INQUIRING, NOT ONLY DIDN'T THEY WORRIED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, BUT ALSO ADVISED ME AND MAKE SURE THAT I'M AWARE THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CARS. DESPITE THE TECHNICIAN'S ADVISE, I WAS STILL VERY WORRIED, SO DUE TO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT DIDN'T HAPPENED BEFORE THE REPAIR , I SCHEDULED TO BRING IT BACK FOR A CHECK ON TUESDAY (4/24). HOWEVER, ON SUNDAY(4/22), AS SOON AS I DROVE OUT FROM MY APARTMENT, I HEARD A CRACK SOUND AND THOUGHT THAT WAS A FLAT TIRE. I STEPPED OUT AND CHECKED THE TIRES, NOTHING WAS WRONG. WHEN I BACKED UP THE CAR, MY FRIENDS SAW PARTS ARE FALLING OUT FROM THE CAR AND THE WHEEL WAS OFF THE AXLE HITTING THE FENDER. THIS ALL HAPPENED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY CAR WHICH WAS DAMAGED IN THE ACCIDENT, AND THE DEALER IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT FIXED. THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THIS WAS CAUSED BY  BALL JOINT DETACHMENT. HE SAID THIS MIGHT BE AN AFTERMATH OF MY FIRST ACCIDENT. AFTER INVESTIGATION, MY INSURANCE COMPANY TOLD ME THIS DEFECT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FIRST ACCIDENT BUT MAY HAD BEEN HAPPENING BEFORE IT OR SOMEONE HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME TO CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN. BOTH THE SERVICE AND THE CLAIM REPRESENTATIVES SAID THIS COULD NOT BE IN ANY OF MY ABILITY TO CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN.*AK",
