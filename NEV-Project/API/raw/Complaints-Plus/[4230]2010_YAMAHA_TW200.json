THE END RESULT IS THAT AS THE OPERATOR IS GIVING THE VEHICLE MORE THROTTLE TO ACCELERATE, THE ENGINE FINALLY FULLY ENGAGES DUE TO THE FAULTY CLUTCH (FINALLY FULLY RELEASING) AND CAUSES THE FRONT WHEEL TO AT TIMES LEAVE THE PAVEMENT. THIS CAUSED THE OPERATOR TO NEARLY DUMP THE VEHICLE ON A BUSY STREET WHEN PROCEEDING FROM A RED LIGHT WHILE DRIVING IT HOME AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT BY THE DEALERSHIP TO REPAIR THE ISSUE. THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW ON 12/03/2011, AND PICKED UP ON 12/07/2011. PROBLEM WORSENED AS THE BIKE WAS RIDDEN. AT 20 MILES, IT WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR.
