        "summary": "The clutch slave cylinder on the KTM 690 / Husqvarna 701 (same engine) is a known weak point.   Mine failed after 130 miles on the odometer.   When the cylinder seal fails the clutch lever will not allow the driver of the vehicle to disengage the clutch.   The driver has two options - avoid stopping because it is unlikely the driver will be able to restart the vehicle or kill the engine at the risk of not being able to get to a safe place to get out of traffic.  I took the motorcycle to the dealer (Fay Myers Denver CO) yesterday and was told they have seen the same problem with four other motorcycles just at that dealership.   There are many Youtube videos warning owners that the clutch slave cylinder needs to be replaced immediately.   I should have followed that advice but I'm wondering why there isn't a recall when this is a known and pervasive problem.   One of the Youtube videos mentions that this problem happened to someone who bought the motorcycle and was riding home for the first time from the dealership.  There are no warning lamps messages or other symptoms to let the driver know there is a problem.  I called customer support Husqvarana at 1 855 282 6227 on Tuesday 7/20 and again today 7/24 and have not received a return phone call.  I will likely get the motorcycle back from repairs sometime next week.",
