I had an outside repair shop check the code with a scan tool along with a Ram dealership. The warning light & alarm goes on and off non stop when driving or even sitting still (very annoying) which also means my antilock brakes are not working. In Michigan, that is a very helpful safety feature when driving on snow and ice. I have contacted the factory Ram customer service number 4 times now and all I'm told is it is out of warranty. I could see that if the truck had, say 100,000 miles on it, but it only has 22,000 miles on it and the antilock brakes need to be worked on already? I'm not asking for new brake pads here. This is a safety issue and Ram Trucks should be forced into a recall about it. I am not the only one. Google it and you will find many, and I mean many trucks having the same issue and many comment, why isn't there a recall on such a safety item as antilock brakes. When talking to the service rep, he said they don't have the parts in stock and they do not have an ETA when any will be available. Makes me wonder if so many others are buying them, they cannot get enough to keep up with demand. We all want safer roads. So I ask, why do we have auto manufacturers install antilock brake systems on new vehicles and then not stand behind them? I realize my truck is out of warranty, but 22,000 miles on my truck and I need serious brake work already?  Unexcusable Ram!",

        "summary": "The Hydraulic Control Unit and the Anti-lock brake module on my 2017 Ram 2500 Diesel truck is going out. It has 84,000 miles on this truck.   This is very costly to repair and Ram knows it is a problem! It is also very dangerous for the brakes to be an issue on any vehicle, but especially on one that has a heavy front end as diesel trucks do. The braking system must be reliable to stop the truck itself. This truck was built and designed to pull trailers and as a work truck. It is very dangerous to consider that these 2 components are not working when pulling a loaded trailer which depends on the braking system as well to stop the vehicle.   I am also enclosing several websites to show you that Ram knows there is a problem but hasn't issued a recall on the problem. One of these sites is a Ram forum that shows many people are dealing with this issue.  https://www.ramforumz.com/threads/abs-hcu-replacement.276340/   https://www.dieseltruckresource.com/forums/3rd-generation-ram-non-drivetrain-all-years-101/abs-cab-hcu-replacement-218820/  Thank you for your time!

I TOOK IT BACK TO BROWNS AND THEY WELDED THE DRAG LINK AND SAID THERE ARE NO PARTS AVAILABLE AND I WOULD GET A CALL WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE. I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL AND I CALLED AND THEY CLAIM THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PART. I NEED MY TRUCK TO DRIVE CORRECTLY. THE DRAG LINK SHOULD NOT BE WELDED. REPLACEMENT IS NEEDED. IT STILL PULLS. I TOW TRAILERS. AFTER THE DRAG LINK WAS WELDED THE \"MECHANIC\" WROTE ON THE SERVICE FORM HE TEST DROVE IT TO CHECK FOR \"TOW\". THAT IS A LIE. THE TRUCK NEVER LEFT THE BAY UNTIL IT WAS DONE. I WAS THERE. THE ODO IN AND OUT IS THE SAME TOO.  I WAS GETTING HELP FROM FCA BUT NOW THEY WONT HELP EITHER. THEY SAID SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE HANDLING IT AND CONTACTING ME AND NOBODY EVER HAS.

THE ORIGINAL WELDING AND THE HEAT AND OTHER REACTIONS TO THE JAM NUTS HAVE WEAKENED AND STRESSED THE METAL IN BOTH THE JAM NUTS AND THE ADJUSTING SLEEVE THE NUTS WERE WELDED TO. 2. THE CUTTING AND REMOVING THE WELD, WITH THE HEAT AND THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE INVOLVED IN REMOVING THE WELD, HAS FURTHER WEAKENED AND STRESSED THE METAL. 3. THE DRAGLINK IS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM TO IT'S ORIGINAL ENGINEERED DESIGN WITH THIS WELDED FIX. 4.
