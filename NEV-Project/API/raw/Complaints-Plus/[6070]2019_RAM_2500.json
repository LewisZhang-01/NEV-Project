I was wearing a hoodie at the time and the airbag deployment caused my hoodie to catch on fire.  There was not an open flame for me to know it was burning.  Instead, it smoldered and burnt my hoodie material.  I could feel the underside of my arm stinging and the holes in my sleeve, but believed that it was a result of the airbag hitting my arm and causing essentially a bad carpet burn.  However, this caused second degree burns to the bottom side of my arm near my arm pit.    I discovered after the incident that airbag deployment is assisted by gunpowder. I am not sure if this is what caused my hoodie to catch fire.  I also discovered that 2021-2022 Rams recently had a recall on Side Airbags due to improperly compressed air.

I have video showing flames coming out of the passenger side engine compartment. I had previously taken my vehicle in for repair for recall W03 to have the transmission valve body replaced so the transmission wouldn't cause an engine fire. FCA had an expert inspect the vehicle and he found that \"fire progression appears to be from engine compartment thru entire vehicle terminating at rear truck bed,\" that \"possible source of ignition is hot surface of turbocharger/exhaust components. - Most likely method of ignition is transmission fluid expelled from dipstick tube,\" \"origin appears to be in the engine compartment,\" and \"possible cause appears to be transmission fluid expelled from dipstick tube onto turbocharger/exhaust components. The determination of possible cause is based on: 1. Owner/driver's description of events. 2. Transmission of dipstick is extended ~ 27.0 inch from the fill tube.\" Despite this, FCA refused to pay me for my destroyed vehicle (or the trailer that it destroyed) because: \"After the inspection of your vehicle, the information at hand would not permit us to associate the fire with a manufacturing or assembly error. We are sure you will understand fires of this nature can and do occur for a number of reasons not associated with the manufacturing process. Therefore, we must respectfully decline any assistance associated with this matter.

IT ALSO HAS SHOWN A NOTIFICATION ON THE DASH THAT THE TAILGATE IS OPEN, BUT WHEN CHECKED IT IS CLOSED.   I HAVE A VIDEO OF THIS, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN UPLOAD IT.  WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IN LATE 2019 AND THE FIRST EVENT WAS IN MARCH 2020, AND IT CAUSED SCRATCHES ON THE PLASTIC TOP PART OF THE TAILGATE, AS IT HIT THE TONGUE JACK OF OUR CAMPER. THE FIRST TIME, WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE HADN'T CLOSED IT HARD ENOUGH, SO WE HAVE ALWAYS MADE A POINT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS SHUT TIGHT.  THE SECOND TIME WAS ON MARCH 14, 2020. THE THIRD TIME WAS JUNE 20, 2020 AND IT CAUSED DAMAGE TO OUR TAILGATE.  WE WERE IN A PARKING LOT MAKING A TURN AND THE TAILGATE OPENED, HITTING THE PROPANE TANK OF OUR TOW BEHIND CAMPER.  IT DENTED THE TAILGATE AND DAMAGED THE PROPANE TANK.  I HAPPENED AGAIN ON JULY 18, 2020.  IT OPENS ON ITS OWN, AND IT IS INTERMITTENT.  I KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED ONCE WHEN WE WERE TURNING AND DRIVING UNDER 10 MPH, BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN/WHY THE BODY DAMAGE HAPPENED.  THIS CREATES AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE CONDITION AS WELL BECAUSE SOMETHING COULD FALL FROM OUR TRUCK BED IF THE TAILGATE OPENS WHILE WE ARE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY, POSSIBLY KILLING SOMEONE OR CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  WE HAVE REPORTED IT TO CHRYSLER TWICE (MOST RECENT CASE NUMBER 76765917).  WE HAVE TAKEN IT IN TWICE TO THE DEALER AFTER IT HAPPENED (MOST RECENTLY ON 7/22/2020). AND THEY CANNOT REPLICATE IT SO NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.  CHRYSLER ADVISED ME TO CONTACT CORPORATE VIA LETTER.",

THERE ARE A COUPE OF SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE COULD EASILY BE RESOLVED WITH A LITTLE PROGRAMMING.      WITH THE FACTORY AIR SUSPENSION, IT AUTO-LEVELS.  THIS MEANS YOU CAN NO LONGER USE HOW MUCH THE TRUCK SUSPENSION SQUATS TO GAUGE THE LOAD THAT THE TRUCK IS CARRYING.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO GAUGE THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THE TRUCK IS CARRYING, ESPECIALLY WHEN LOADING A TRAILER (SUCH AS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ON THE TRAILER), SO THAT THE COMBINATION CAN BE SAFELY DRIVEN AND HANDLE WELL.  THE ONLY INDICATION OF THE WEIGHT IS WHEN THE TRUCK REPORTS \"AIR SUSPENSION DISABLE DUE TO PAYLOAD\".  THIS ISSUE COULD BE EASILY SOLVED WITH A LITTLE PROGRAMMING TO SHOW THE DRIVER THE PRESSURE IN THE REAR AIR BAGS ON THE UCONNECT/STEERING WHEEL DISPLAY.    THE OTHER ISSUES COMES FROM WHEN THE \"AIR SUSPENSION DISABLE DUE TO PAYLOAD\" MESSAGE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.  ONCE ACTIVATED, THE ONLY WAY TO RESTORE THE AIR SUSPENSION FUNCTION IS TO DRIVE AT OR ABOVE 14MPH.  THIS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RESET BY THE DRIVER, AND WITH THE VEHICLE STATIONARY.  IF YOU TRY TO UNHOOK A TRAILER THAT HAS SET THIS MESSAGE, EVEN AFTER THE LOAD HAS BEEN REMOVED, YOU HAVE TO JACK THE TRAILER EXCESSIVELY HIGH AS THE AIR SUSPENSION DOES NOT AUTO-LEVEL AND WILL KEEP RAISING UNTIL THE AIR BAG TRAVEL MAXES OUT.  ONCE DRIVING THE VEHICLE TO RESET THE SUSPENSION AND TRYING TO RE-HOOK THE TRAILER, YOU RUN OUT OF JACK BEFORE THE TRAILER SITS ON THE TRUCK BALL AT IT'S NORMAL AUTO-LEVEL RIDE HEIGHT.  THIS CAUSES A NUMBER OF SAFETY ISSUES WHEN TRYING TO RE-HITCH.      PLEASE LOOK INTO THESE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE AUTO-LEVEL SUSPENSION OF THE RAM, AS I BELIEVE BOTH ARE EASILY SOLVABLE WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A SOFTWARE UPDATE.
