I CALLED AAA AND THE SORENTO WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST MECHANIC SHOP. WITHOUT INVESTING TOO MUCH TIME IN IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT A HUGE BILL, THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT IT HAS ELECTRICAL POWER - HAS GOOD POWER TO THE STARTER, BUT THE ENGINE DOES NOT ROTATE. THEY COULD NOT EVEN PHYSICALLY ROTATE THE ENGINE. HE TOLD ME THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT WAS, IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR IT BECAUSE, AT THIS POINT, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT.

NOW MY BRAKES DON'T WORK BUT I STILL HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR. I WENT TO 2 OTHER SHOPS AND NO ONE WILL WORK ON MY CAR DUE TO IT FALLING APART FROM RUST. I PURCHASE MY CAR AT ABC MOTOR CREDIT AUGUST OF 2013 AND RE-LOCATED TO FLORIDA BEFORE WINTER HIT. I CALLED THEM AND THEY REFERRED ME THEIR WARRANTY COMPANY, LISA WARRANTY GROUP. OF COURSE, RUST DAMAGE AND FRAME WORK IS NOT COVERED. ABC MOTOR CREDIT SOLD ME A CAR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALED, NOT RE-SOLD TO A CONSUMER FOR $12,000!! I HAVE TRIED 5 DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS TO HELP GET INTO A NEWER, SAFER VEHICLE, BUT NO ONE WILL FINANCE ME DUE TO THE NEGATIVE EQUITY ON THIS LOAN. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? I SHOULD NOT BE STUCK PAYING $367 A MONTH FOR THE NEXT 2 YEARS AFTER ALREADY INVESTING OVER $4,000 INTO A USELESS VEHICLE. I HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT ABC MOTOR CREDIT SOLD ME THIS CAR FULLY KNOWING THE EXTENT OF THE RUST DAMAGE BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THEIR LOT. I HOPE THERE IS SOME LAW PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM THIS SORT OF BUSINESS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT I CAN DO!   *TR",

I AM NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY BECAUSE I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER WHICH IS RIDICUALOUS IN ITSELF BECAUSE THE WARRANTY SHOULD COVER MILEAGE AS IT STATES NOT OWNERS. HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE FLUID LEAKING OUT OF THE WATER RESERVOIR/OR POSSIBLY A FAILED WATER PUMP THAT KIA KNOWS WILL FAIL. IF KIA WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND DID NOT ISSUE A RECALL, KNOWING THAT THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS ENGINE PROBLEMS OR DEATH, WHY ARE THEY NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MOTOR?

IF YOU SPEND ANY MONEY ON A VEHICLE, CHANGE THE OIL EVERY 3 TO 5 THOUSAND MILES FOLLOW ALL SAFETY RECALLS, YOU SHOULD EXPECT MORE THAN 75,000 MILES OUT OF IT. KIA SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!

I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION OF SUCH. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. I AM THANKFUL THAT I WAS IN A RURAL AREA WHEN THIS FAILURE OCCURRED. BASED UPON SOME RESEARCH FINDINGS, I HOPE THAT I DO NOT EXPERIENCE BALKING WHILE ATTEMPTING TO HAVE THIS ISSUE REMEDIED, AS OTHERS HAVE. I HAVE REVIEWED SOME DISCUSSION REGARDING A SERVICE BULLETIN #018 (NHTSA ITEM NUMBER : 10009688 DATE OF BULLETIN : JUL 01, 2004 CRANKSHAFT PULLEY BOLT) ISSUED BY KIA CONCERNING THIS FAILURE. I WILL BE ARRANGING FOR THE UNIT TO BE DELIVERED TO MY NEAREST KIA DEALER (45 MILES AWAY IN QUINCY, IL).",

TO DATE, I HAVE REPLACED VARIOUS BRAKE LIGHT BULBS, HEADLIGHT BULBS, DOME LIGHT BULB AND MY RADIO UNEXPLAINABLE TURNS ON/OFF. WHILE I HAVE DEALT WITH THESE ISSUES AS THEY ARISE, MY CAR HAS NOW TURNED OF WHILE DRIVING ON THE ROAD TWICE. ON BOTH OCCASIONS, ALL OF THE CAR LIGHTS, DISPLAYS, ETC, TURN OFF COMPLETELY AND THE CAR SIMPLY COASTS WHILE OFF.     ONE OF THE OCCURRENCES I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE GOING 65 MPH, AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN. BOTH TIMES I PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WHEN I TURNED THE KEY, IT STARTED AGAIN.     MY OBVIOUS CONCERN IS THAT OF SAFETY AS IT RELATES TO THE VARIOUS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS (WHICH ARE NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY) WHICH THIS CAR HAS HAD. WHILE I CANNOT SPEAK FOR OTHER KIA OWNERS, THERE ARE A HOST OF FORUMS WHICH RELATE TO SIMILAR ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEALERSHIPS THEMSELVES ARE AWARE OF THE ELECTRICAL ISSUES, AS NOTED TO ME PERSONALLY BY ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS.

MY FIRST VISIT FOR MY KIA WAS ON FEB. 16TH TO INVESTIGATE WHY I HAD PROBLEMS STARTING MY KIA. I HAD TO KEEP CRANKING IT UNTIL IT WOULD TURN ON THIS WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR WOULD SIT FOR AWHILE SO BASICALLY IT WAS COLD EACH TIME I TRIED TURNING IT ON. WELL GEWEKE ORDER THE FUEL PUMP FOR THE KIA. THEY WERE INFORMED BY KIA TECH THAT WHAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED WAS THE FUEL PUMP. WELL AFTER I GOT MY CAR BACK IT WORKED FINE FOR A FEWS WEEKS. THEN AGAIN IN JUNE OR JULY I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK IN BECAUSE I WAS GETTING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE KIA. GEWEKE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP ONCE AGAIN. WELL IT WORK GOOD FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS UNTIL THIS WEEKEND. I CALLED GEWEKE ON TUESDAY 9/7 SO I HAD TO LEAVE WORK EARLY AGAIN. THIS TIME GEWEKE PROVIDED ME WITH  A RENTAL AND THEY ARE KEEPING MY CAR IN THEIR SHOP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER AT GEWEKE AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT KIA AND HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM. HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT HIS TECHNICIANS WON'T BE WORKING THIS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND THAT TOMORROW I WILL HAVE TO RETURN THE RENTAL ANDM PICK UP MY KIA EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE FIXED. IF ITS NOT FIXED I WILL HAVE TO DROP OFF THE KIA AT THE SHOP AND GET ANOTHER RENTAL ON THEM. I AM REALLY UNHAPPY WITH MY KIA AND I'M NOT 100 % SATISIFIED. I PURCHASED THIS BRAND NEW VEHICLE FOR ONE REASON AND IT WAS BECUASE I WAS TRIED OF HAVING TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE. I'M THINKING OF FILING A CLAIM ON THE VEHICLE. I GOT STUCK WITH A LEMON. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN FIX TGHE CAR BUT I WILL STILL NOT BE SATISFIED. CAN ANYONE GIVE ME ANY ADVICE ON WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET OUT OF THIS F***ED UP KIA?*AK",

I HAVE COMPLAINED MANY TIMES ABOUT A ROAD VIBRATION AT 68-72 MPH. DEALER HAS SEEN MY CAR 5 TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE 1ST TIME THE DEALER SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT SAID THEY HAD ONLY DRIVEN IT TO 63 MPH. THE 2ND TIME I TOOK IT IN,  PROBLEM HAD BEEN NOTED IN A NUMBER OF SORENTO'S NATIONWIDE & THEY WERE GOING TO NEED TO CHANGE THE DRIVE SHAFT. 3RD TIME FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM & UPON PICKING UP THE CAR FOUND OUT THAT THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE DRIVE SHAFT, BUT GREASED IT W/SPECIAL HEAVY DUTY GREASE &TURNED IT 180 DEGREES. I ASKED WHY HADN'T CHANGED DRIVE SHAFT, & THEY SAID THE MANUFACTURER'S TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN RECOMMENDED THIS PROCEDURE 1ST. THE VIBRATION HAS SLOWLY RETURNED. I CALLED THE DEALER & THEY SAID THEY WOULD PUT ME ON LIST TO DRIVE CAR W/REGIONAL SERVICE MGR. THEY CALLED & SAID HE WAS IN TOWN, SO I WENT TO DRIVE CAR WITH LOCAL SERVICE MGR & REGIONAL SERVICE MGR.THEY FELT THERE WAS NOTHING HIGHLY NOTICEABLE ABOUT VIBRATION & SAID IT COULD BE THE ROADS. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL BACK IF IT GOT WORSE. IN AUGUST '04, WERE DRIVING & MY CAR BEGAN TO SMOKE. A HUGE TRAIL OF SMOKE COMING OUT FROM UNDER CAR. WE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD & CALLED 24HR TOWING FROM THE DEALER. CAR TOWED TO OSBORN KIA IN COLO. & FOUND THAT THE ENTIRE RACK & PINON STEERING MECHANISM & GEAR BOX HAD BLOWN UP THROWING STEERING FLUID ON THE ENGINE. SO MUCH SMOKE I THOUGHT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE! WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF OUR STEERING WOULD HAVE GONE OUT IN A TIGHT TURN! THE DEALER'S SERVICE MGR SAID IN ALL OF HIS YEAR'S THE DEALERSHIP HAD NEVER REPLACED THIS PART. THE ENTIRE STEERING SYSTEM REPLACED, THE CAR IS NOW VIBRATING ONCE AGAIN AT 68-71MPH. I AM GOING TO CONTACT THE DEALER BUT AM CONCERNED THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS.   *JB",
