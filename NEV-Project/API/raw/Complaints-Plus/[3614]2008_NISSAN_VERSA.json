A quick visual inspection of all the vehicles typically parked near that area did not show any sitting uneven or any obvious evidence of any with problems.  A few weeks later, after driving approx 1000 miles on my nissan, I noticed that the front suspension seemed shorter and quicker to bottom-out. This was obvious when rolling over speed humps. Another, more in-depth inspection of the front springs revealed an unseated spring on the left front.  The spring appears to have slipped off or through the bottom cup and is not centered on the strut.  After looking the vehicle up on NHTSA site this appears to be related to Manufacturer Recall NumberPM565.  The NJ vehicle is currently in NC.  I plan to take it to a Nissan dealer to have the recall work performed.",

FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, OUR NISSAN VERSA WOULD BRIEFLY LOSE POWER WHEN WE STEPPED ON THE GAS PEDAL, BUT IT ONLY HAPPENED OCCASIONALLY AND TEMPORARILY. THEN ON JULY 15, IT GOT MUCH WORSE. WE COULD BARELY DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE IT WOULD CONSTANTLY LOSE POWER. THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN WE STARTED THE CAR AND CONTINUED AS WE WERE TRYING TO DRIVE THE CAR A COUPLE OF BLOCKS ON THE CITY STREETS. I AM THANKFUL THAT WE WERE NOT ON A HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE CAUSED A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. WE LEARNED LATER THAT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION AND THE CAR WAS TRYING TO START IN A HIGH GEAR INSTEAD OF A LOW GEAR.    OUR 2008 NISSAN VERSA IS 6 WEEKS PAST THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE BELOW THE MILEAGE REQUIREMENT OF THE WARRANTY AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS LIKELY BEEN GIVING US PROBLEMS FOR YEARS, NISSAN WILL NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY.    I BELIEVE NISSAN SHOULD BE ORDERING A RECALL ON THE CVT TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OLDER MODELS. THEY KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS FLAWED AND UNSAFE, THAT'S WHY THEY CREATED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. BUT IF YOU'RE JUST OUT OF THAT WARRANTY PERIOD, THEY WON'T HELP YOU OUT AS A CONSUMER. IF THEY PUBLICIZED THE CVT PROBLEM AND ORDERED A RECALL, THEY WOULD PREVENT HAVING UNSAFE CARS ON THE ROAD.",

SO I WAS GIVEN AT RENTAL CAR SINCE THEY WERE OUT OF LOANER CARS AT FRED ANDERSON NISSAN OF RALEIGH, NC.  WHICH IS GOOD.  TWO WEEKS AGO I GOT A CALL FROM THE PARTS DEPT. OF FRED ANDERSON STATING THAT MY DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG PART IS IN AND I SHOULD COME FOR A REPAIR, SO I ASKED IF THEY HAD AN  OFFICIAL LETTER FROM NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, BECAUSE I HAD NOT RECEIVED THE SECOND LETTER NOTIFYING ME OF THE PART BEING AVAILABLE.  I ASKED HIM WHAT BRAND AND HE (ALEX) SAID TAKATA AND IT WAS A LIMITED SUPPLY.  NOW THAT COMPANY AND ALL ITS HOLDINGS HAVE GONE BANKRUPT.  I SAID I WOULD CALL HIM BACK.  THEN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THEIR INTERNET SALES PERSON CHAD SUSAN STATING THAT I SHOULD BRING MY CAR IN AND TRADE IT IN FOR A NEW CAR, SINCE THE RECALL PART WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL SPRING 2018, THEY WOULD TAKE MY CAR NOW IF I WANTED TO TRADE IT IN FOR A NEW CAR.  HMMMM SAME DEALERSHIP.  THEN I GOT A CALL FROM LAUREN FROM SERVICE STATING THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG RECALL PART IS IN.  SO I CALLED NISSAN NORTH AMERICA CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON 11/10/17  ANS SPOKE TO BRIDGETTE AND  SHE SAID THE RECALL PART IS NOT IN AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY LIMITED SUPPLY OF AIRBAGS FOR THE DRIVER SIDE RECALL.  SHE SAID SHE WOULD OPEN A CLAIM AND A CLAIM REP,. WOULD CALL FROM A 615 NUMBER. SO I GOT A CALL FROM JACCO FROM NISSAN NORTH AMERICA CLAIMS WHO STATED THAT HE SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND SERVICE DIRECTOR AND THEY HAD A LIMITED SUPPLY OF THE AIRBAGS. SO I ASKED JACCO TO SEND ME A LETTER OR AN EMAIL STATING THAT THEY INDEED HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AIRBAGS FOR THE RECALL PART AND HE SAID HE COULD NOT DO THAT. THIS IS ALARMING!!!!!!

I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, IT'S A BIG SAFETY ISSUE, THEY CAN'T JUST REFUSE IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT 21. WHAT DOES AGE HAVE TO DO WITH OUR SAFETY? THE FOLLOWING MORNING, ME AND MY BOYFRIEND DROVE TO THE ROUTE 33 NISSAN IN HAMILTON, NJ. A LADY NAMED MCKAYLA DID THE PAPERWORK FOR US, EVERYTHING WAS SET AND THEN SHE SAID \"OH WAIT YOU'RE NOT 21 YET, I CAN'T LOAN YOU A CAR.\" SHE SAID TO CALL THE SERVICE ASSIST LINE TO FURTHER ASSIST US. SO WE CALLED THE LINE, AND TURNS OUT THE GUY THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TALK TO DOESN'T WORK ON THE WEEKENDS. SO IF THE AIRBAGS WOULD'VE WENT OFF DURING THE WEEKEND AND WE DIED, THEN WHAT? I CALLED MCKAYLA ON MONDAY AND SHE TOLD US IF WE COULD FIND A COMPANY THAT WOULD RENT US THE CAR, NISSAN WOULD PAY FOR IT. SO I CALLED HERTZ IN NEW YORK SINCE THEIR LEGAL AGE TO RENT A CAR IS 18, AND THEY AGREED TO RENT US A CAR BUT NISSAN REFUSED TO PAY FOR IT SINCE IT WAS OUT OF STATE. IF NISSAN SCREWED UP WITH THESE RECALLS, THEY NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND PAY THE NECESSARY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. WE WENT BACK TO THE ROUTE 33 NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND WENT TO THE SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE TO SPEAK TO HIM. HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT 21. LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE 21 TO OWN A NISSAN. LAST TIME I CHECKED, THERE WAS NOWHERE IN THE PAPERWORK WHEN BUYING A NISSAN THAT STATES: \"IN THE CASE OF A RECALL, IF YOU'RE NOT 21 AND OVER YOU WILL BE LEASED A LOANER CAR TILL WE FIX YOUR CAR\" SO THEN WHY IS THIS SUCH AN ISSUE?

IT ALSO STATED \"NISSAN ANTICIPATES PARTS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR VERSA BY THE END OF APRIL 2017\".    SINCE THEN,  I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY NEW UPDATES OR NOTICE FROM NISSAN.  IN AUGUST 2017, I PHONED NISSAN'S CONSUMER AFFAIRS DIVISION AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG ALSO HAD A RECALL FOR SIMILAR FATAL RISK.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK INTO A FORM OF COMPENSATION SINCE THE CAR COULD NOT BE DRIVEN.    AFTER SETTING ME UP WITH A LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP (CAMPBELL NISSAN OF EDMONDS), I WOULD FIND OUT THE DEALERSHIP EXPECTED ME TO DRIVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AS A PREREQUISITE TO GET SETUP WITH ENTERPRISE RENTAL CAR.  THIS SEEMED TO BE FLAWED PLAN, CONSIDERING THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG POSED A FATAL RISK.    ALONG WITH THAT, BECAUSE THE RENTAL CAR WOULD REQUIRE ME TO ADD INSURANCE NEW COVERAGES, NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ANY ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COST I HAD TO ASSUME FOR THEIR RENTAL LOANER VEHICLE.  THE TAKATA AIRBAGS PARTS STILL DO NOT HAVE AN EXPECTED DATE.    WITH THE LACK OF NOTICE (PHONE CALL, EMAIL, LETTER) OUTSIDE OF THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH TO MY WIFE AND I DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND OWNERSHIP ON NISSAN'S PART.

ON OCTOBER 27, 2016 I CALLED AGAIN, AS IN THE MEANTIME I WAS NOT ABLE TO HAVE ANY PASSENGERS RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT, AND I HAVE BEEN VERY DILIGENT IN COMPLYING WITH THIS SUGGESTION.

I WENT TO THIS SITE & NOTICED IRONICALLY THAT THE FRONT COIL SPRING ISSUES ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT.

WHILE DRIVING WITH A MORE EXPERIENCED MECHANIC HE WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOUND TO BE ISOLATED TO THE RIGHT STRUT AND THE LEFT INNER TIE ROD.

I AM WRITING THE COMPLAINT BECAUSE I THINK THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE ALL ALONG. THE CAR NEEDS AN ABNORMAL AMOUNT OF REALIGNMENTS AND BRAKE REPLACEMENTS.

THEREFORE I HAD TO SPEND 97$ AND HAVE THEM REPLACE THIS BECAUSE IT WAS BEYOND SAVING. TWO DAYS LATER I ENDED UP BACK AT THE TIRE PLACE FOR THEM TO TELL ME THAT I NEED TO REPLACE MORE SENSORS.

LUCKILY NO BODY WAS HURT AND I MANAGED TO NOT HIT ANY VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS WAITING FOR A TWO TRUCK AND PHILADELPHIA POLICE, THE VEHICLE AND MYSELF MADE OUR WAY TO A BODY SHOP IN LANSDALE, PA.  AFTER EXAMINATION FROM THE MECHANICS AT THIS BODY SHOP (J.L. FREED) I WAS TOLD THAT THE STRUT ASSEMBLY IN MY FRONT RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE WAS IN 3 PIECES.  THIS WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT SOMETHING MECHANICALLY WENT WRONG AS I WAS MAKING THAT SLIGHT RIGHT ON THE EVENING OF JULY 23, 2008.    NOW, I WAS GIVEN MY ESTIMATE FOR THE DAMAGES AND THE PARTS THAT NEED TO ORDERED AND REPLACED.  I FEEL THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO BE MADE AWARE OF THIS EVENT AS I WAS JUST AT A NISSAN DEALER (MONTGOMERYVILLE NISSAN) 3 WEEKS PRIOR (JULY 05, 2008) TO HAVE MY CAR INSPECTED.  I HAVE YET TO FIND OUT IF MONTGOMERYVILLE NISSAN SAW ANY TYPE OF POTENTIAL FAILURE IN THIS SPECIFIC STRUT ASSEMBLY THAT MALFUNCTIONED AND SPLIT APART CAUSING MY ACCIDENT.  NISSAN NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF THIS INCIDENT AS THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FATALITY OF MYSELF OR ANOTHER IF I WAS SAY ON THE HIGHWAY THIS STRUT ASSEMBLY DECIDED TO FALL APART.  *TR",
