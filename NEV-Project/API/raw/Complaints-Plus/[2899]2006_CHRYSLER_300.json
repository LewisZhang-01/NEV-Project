THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN A RECALL ON BOTH AND THERE ISN'T.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS WHEN I STALLED ONTO THE FREEWAY I WAS ALMOST HIT BY AN 18 WHEELER TRUCK ON LAST WEEK.

THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME WE FUEL UP.I BOUGHT THE CAR SECOND-HAND FROM A DEALER WHO LIKED TO CHARGE ME FOR MISC REPAIRS THEY NEVER ACTUALLY FIXED (ACCORDING TO MY OWN MECHANIC).  MY MECHANIC HAS NO ANSWERS.  OTHER THAN THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM, I LIKE MY VEHICLE,  DO YOU KNOW IF CHRYSLER HAS THE ANSWER AND IF THIS CAN BE RESOLVED? I AM GUESSING AT WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED. SOMETIME IN 2012 SHORTLY AFTER THE PURCHASE",

RECENTLY, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AT 70-75 MPH ON I-95 - ENGINE COMPLETELY CONKED OUT AND STARTED STEAMING. TOWED IT TO THE MECHANIC. ORIGINALLY THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS JUST A CRACK/LEAK IN THE RADIATOR, WHICH WOULD COST $750. THEY WENT AHEAD AND FIXED THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, 2 HOURS LATER WE GET A CALL SAYING THERE WAS A SEVERE CRACK IN THE ENGINE THAT HAS CAUSED A MAJOR LEAK INTERNALLY. NOW AT THE MERCY OF THE MECHANIC, AS WE OWE THEM $750 FOR THEIR MISDIAGNOSIS.    NEW DIAGNOSIS - NEED A COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT THAT WOULD COST APPROX $8000-$8500. ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION KBB VALUE IS BETWEEN $9,000-$10,000.     AFTER DOING MY RESEARCH IT SEEMS A NEW 300 ENGINE WOULD BE BETWEEN $4,000-$5,500 AND LABOR IS APPROX $1,800-$2,500. SO I GUESS IT ISN'T A BAD DEAL FOR MECHANICS WHO CAN POSSIBLY FIX IT THEMSELVES. HOWEVER, AS USUAL THE LOYAL CUSTOMERS ALWAYS SEEM TO GET SCREWED BY CHRYSLER.     WORST PART ABOUT IT IS 4 MONTHS AGO WE PURCHASED A NEW 300. MAYBE THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY REVAMPED THE ENTIRE ENGINE OF THE NEWER CHRYSLER 300 MODEL RANGE???",

I GUIDED THE CAR TO THE SAFEST PLACE I COULD (STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK. HUNDREDS OF CARS DROVE BY HONKING AND SWEARING AT ME LEAVING ME STUCK IN MY VEHICLE AS IT WAS TO UNSAFE TO GET OUT.

AFTER A WEEK AND A HALF AND CLOSE TO 500 LATER I WAS CALLED WITH THE NEWS THAT A CYLINDAR COLLAPSED CAUSING MY ENGINE TO FAIL. IT WOULD BE A 7,000-9,000 REPAIR AT THE LEAST.

GRATEFUL I WAS NOT ON A HIGHWAY ALONE OR WHILE DRIVING.  I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT HAD THIS OCCURRED IN TRAFFIC.  IT HAS COST ME $560 (THREE TOWS TO REPAIR SHOP #1, CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP #2 AND FINALLY HOME AND A CHARGE FROM EACH REPAIR SHOP TO LOOK AT AND ASSESS THE DAMAGES (NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF THE RENTAL CARS).  END RESULT, \"PISTON #4 DAMAGED, MISSING LARGE PIECE OF PISTON TOP, NEED TO REPLACE ENGINE, ESTIMATED COST $8093.\" THE SERVICE TECH SAID HE'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. BASED ON NUMEROUS REPORTS OF COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE FOUND ONLINE WHILE RESEARCHING THE COST OF REPLACEMENT ENGINES AT HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CHRYSLER/300C/2006/ENGINE/COMPLETE_ENGINE_FAILURE.SHTML, I NOW DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT ALL.

SEE WORST MODEL YEAR GRAPHIC AT HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CHRYSLER/300C/, BASED ON NUMBER OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS.  IT SEEMS THE 2006 CHRYSLER 300C ENGINE ITSELF IS SIMPLY THE PROBLEM AND CHANCES ARE A NEW ENGINE TOO WOULD LIKELY FAIL. THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP SAID, 'WE'D JUST JUNK YOUR CAR' (A FULLY-LOADED 2006 I PAID $44K FOR BRAND NEW). NOW, WITH 94000 MILES ON IT, IT IS JUNK?  THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED.  SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG AT CHRYSLER.  IN 2013, SOMETHING CAUSED COMPLETE BATTERY DRAIN.  DRIVER DOOR BEGAN FALLING APART. AFTER FILLING UP, MY CAR STALLED IN TRAFFIC WHILE DRIVING AND IDLE.

SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER WHERE THE MECHANIC  SAID THE PROBLEM WAS A PART LOCATED WITHIN THE GEAR SHIFT THAT MALFUNCTIONED CAUSING THE GEAR SHIFT NOT TO MOVE. THE PART JUST SIMPLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, BUT IT WOULD COST ME NEARLY $700.00. THE SAME DAY I HAD THE CAR REPAIRED I CONTACTED CHRYSLER (THE COMPANY) AND WAS TOLD  THEY COULD NOT HELP ME WITH THIS PROBLEM. SO I WAITED TO SEE WHAT I SHOULD DO. ON JULY 17, 2014- I CONTACTED CHRYSLER TO TRY AND SPEAK WITH THEM ONE LAST TIME ABOUT THE SITUATION BEFORE GOING TO COURT. AT ONE POINT THE REPRESENTATIVE EVEN BECAME TEMPERAMENTAL WITH ME STATING THAT BECAUSE MY CAR DID NOT HAVE THE PROPER VIN # IT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE RECALL, REGARDLESS IF IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OR NOT.

LONG STORY BUT YES I HAD TO STICK A SCREW DRIVE INTO THE GEAR BOX TO RELEASE THE CAR INTO DRIVE AND OUT REPAIR COST $175 I WAS INFORMED MY VIN WASN'T A PART OF THE RECALL! NEXT ISSUE THE COOLING FANS IN FRONT OF THE CAR. I WAS GETTING SOME FOOD AT DRIVE THRU. AS SOON AS I DRIVE IN LINE I HEARD A LOUD BANG ONE OF THE FANS MOUNTS BECAME LOOSE AND THE FAN BLADES HIT TO SIDE WALL AND BROKE. $500 LATER TO REPLACE AND YES AGAIN THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THAT BUT NOT MY VIN!!!! FINAL STRAW MY SON AND I WHERE DRIVING HOME FROM A GAME IT WAS RAINING. BOTH OF US NOTICE THE SMELL OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE VENT IT WAS FAINT BUT CONSISTENT. WE LUCKILY DIDN'T HAVE FAR TRAVEL HOME. WHEN I PULLED IN AND TURNED THE CAR OFF I OPENED THE HOOD A LIL BIT SMOKE AND BECAUSE THE RAIN WAS HITTING THE ENGINE IT MADE A LIL BIT MORE OF SMOKE. SO I CLOSED IT AND WENT INSIDE. THE NEXT DAY I NOTICED BOTH THE PASSENGER HEAD LIGHT AND FOG LIGHTS WEREN'T WORKING. I CHECKED THE FUSES, GOOD. WENT UP TO GET REPLACEMENT BULBS. THE EMPLOYEE AT THE STORE HAD A [XXX] OF A TIME TRYING TO REMOVING THE LIGHT FROM THE HARNESS. WE NOTICED THAT THE PLASTIC WAS MELTED AND DIS COLORED. WHEN I GOT HOME I GOT A LOOK AT THE FOG LIGHT HARNESS IT WAS FACTORY FOGS AND THE HARNESS WAS MELTED BLACK PLASTIC. SO I HAD TO ORDER REPLACEMENT FOG LIGHTS AND HEAD LIGHTS $475.

THIS PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED IN 2011 AFTER FUELING THE VEHICLE AND  PULLING INTO TRAFFIC. THE ENGINE DID RESTART AND CLEARED ITSELF OUT RIGHT AWAY. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER AND AT THAT TIME I'M GUESSING IT WAS A NEW ISSUE BECAUSE \" WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT\". AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT OTHERS WERE ALSO HAVING THIS PROBLEM AFTER FILL UP. IN FEB 2014 I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THESE AND OTHER LX PLATFORM CHRYSLERS ON THESE TANKS. BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP I GO WITH THIS INFORMATION AND THE LOCAL DEALER PUT ME ON A WAITING LIST. IN SEPT. 2014 WE WERE TOLD WE WERE NEXT ON THE LIST FOR A NEW TANK. IT IS NOW LATE OCTOBER AND STILL NO TANK. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THERE WERE 2000 OF THESE TANKS ON BACKORDER AND THE WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AS THEY ARE BUILT. TODAY I CALLED THE CHRYSLER SUPPORT LINE. THE LADY WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC. SHE CALLED MY DEALER AND SOMEHOW I WENT FROM NEXT ON THE LIST TO #3 ON THE LIST. I NOW FEEL THAT THE BEAN COUNTERS THINK A LOT OF THE CARS WILL SOMEHOW GO AWAY AND THEN SO WILL THE PROBLEM. A FEW STALLED VEHICLES INVOLVED IN LETHAL CRASHES CAUSED BY THIS STALLING ISSUE LINKED TO THE FUEL SHUT OFF FLOAT STICKING MAY BE WHAT IT TAKES. WE KNOW THAT BY ONLY FUELING THE TANK TO 3/4 FULL WE DO NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM. IF WE SHOULD TRADE THIS VEHICLE THE NEXT OWNER NEEDS TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THE TANK BUT THERE IS NO PARTS SUPPORT.  *TR",

THE NHTSA OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATION SOON OPENED INVESTIGATION PE13016 INTO THE FUEL TANK PROBLEM. THE ODI INFORMATION REQUEST TO CHRYSLER CITED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING MINE. INVESTIGATION PE13016 WAS CLOSED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY NHTSA BECAUSE THE \"CONDITION IS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BY CHRYSLER'S EXTENDED WARRANTY\" ON 2006 CHRYSLER 300 FUEL TANKS.  THE CLOSING SUMMARY REFERS TO CHRYSLER SENDING LETTERS TO OWNERS ABOUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  SINCE I DID NOT RECEIVE AN OWNER LETTER, I TODAY CALLED THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER, 1-800-247-9753.    THE ASSISTANCE CENTER REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT WITHIN THE EXTENDED WARRANTY  BECAUSE MY VEHICLE (BUILT WITHIN THE EXTENDED WARRANTY TIME FRAME) CONTAINED A GAS TANK WITH THE SALES CODE \"NSKS\" AND THAT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ONLY COVERS CARS BUILT WITH THE GAS TANK SALES CODE \"NSK.\"   NOTHING IN THE MATERIALS POSTED ONLINE WITH PE13016 INDICATE THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT GAS TANKS, ONLY ONE OF WHICH HAD PROBLEMS. PLEASE, RECONSIDER WHETHER THE CHRYSLER RESPONSE IS ADEQUATE. MY VEHICLE, WITH THE \"NSKS\" GAS TANK, CLEARLY SUFFERED THE REFILL STALLING PROBLEM ADDRESSED IN PE 13016.",

I FOUND THAT I CAN AVOID THE STALLING IF I DON'T FILL THE TANK FULL. A SAD SOLUTION TO A FAULTY FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM. I'M THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE CAR AND HAVE RELIGIOUSLY CARED FOR IT. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY DOCUMENTATION FROM CHRYSLER REGARDING OFFERING TO CORRECT THE FLOAT (WHICH NOW THEY HAVE CONCLUDED IS THE PROBLEM). TO SET A DEADLINE ON JANUARY 2014 WITHOUT NOTIFICATION OF THE OWNERS IS POOR BUSINESS. IF THAT IS THEIR POSITION THAN I WILL DO MY BEST TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM BUYING THEIR VEHICLES. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A RECALL BY NOTIFYING ALL THE OWNERS. I DO GET MAILERS FROM SEVERAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIPS AND THEY HAVE ALL MY RECORDS!!  SHAME ON YOU, CHRYSLER!!!  *TR",

I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC WHERE HE PUT IT ON THE SCANNER AND A CODE CAME UP STATING THAT THE #6 CYLINDER WAS FAULTY. WHEN RUNNING THE CAR HAS NO POWER AND YOU CAN HEAR A DISTINCT CLICKING OF THE MDS SOLENOID. AS IT CLICK ON AND OFF THE CARS IDLE WAS NORMAL THEN VERY ROUGH. SERVICE RECORDS ARE IMMACULATE, OIL CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES WITH MOBIL 5-20 FULL SYNTHETIC. SERVICE SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY FOLLOWED. THE SOLENOID WAS CHANGED OUT AND IT RAN FINE FOR ABOUT 500 MILES AND THEN IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN, VERY RANDOM AND MOSTLY WHEN YOU GO INTO PASSING GEAR ON THE FREEWAY THAT'S WHEN YOU TOTALLY LOSE POWER AND IT SHUTTERS VIOLENTLY. WE CANT FIND ANYTHING FOR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO FIX IT EXCEPT THAT IT MAY BE A BAD COMPUTER OR A CLOGGED OIL PORT IN THE CYLINDER HEAD. BOTH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ARE VERY COSTLY AND I WOULD HATE TO SPEND ALL THAT MONEY AND IT NOT FIX THE ISSUE.

        "summary": "BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2011 WHEN THE CAR HAD 115260 MILES ON IT, I HAD BEEN HAVING ISSUES FOR SOME TIME WITH THE CAR NOT SHIFTING INTO HIGHER GEARS WHEN TRYING TO PASS SOMEONE ON THE ROAD. THE CAR SEEMED TO WANT TO STALL BUT THEN WOULD PICK UP AND DRIVE FINE BUT IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE CAR WOULD STICK IN A LOWER GEAR AND NOT GET OVER 58 MILES PER HOUR EVEN IF I HAD IT FLOORED.      THEY REPLACED THE VALVE BODY INPUT SPEED SENSOR FOR THIS AT A TUNE OF $1041.99.    NEXT ISSUE WITH THIS CAR WAS A TIE ROD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR. I KEPT HEARING A KNOCK NOISE THAT I JUST COULDN'T PUT MY FINGER ON BUT I TOLD THE GUYS AT THE GARAGE THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE FRONT TIRE AREA ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE TIE ROD WAS GETTING READY TO BREAK.    THE CURRENT ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL FOR ME IS THE FUEL.     I JUST HAD A VAPOR CANISTER INSTALLED THAT DID NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE BUT IT DID GET RID OF A FEW OF THE PROBLEMS.    WHEN I FIRST STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR SHUTTING DOWN AFTER A FILL UP, I THOUGHT THE GAS HAD WATER IN IT BUT IT'S NOT THE GAS. NO MATTER WHAT STATION I FILL UP AT, I HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS.     THE CAR WILL DRIVE FINE FOR ABOUT 3 CAR LENGTHS, THEN IT WILL HESITATE, CHOKE, JUMP, TRY TO DIE, JERK FORWARD AND THEN FINALLY STALL AND SHUT ITSELF OFF. THEN IT WILL TAKE 3 OR MORE TRIES TO GET THE CAR TO RESTART AND IT MAY DO THE SAME THINGS OVER AGAIN FOR ANOTHER BLOCK OR TWO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IN THE FIRST 3 BLOCKS OF DRIVING THIS CAR AFTER A FILL UP, I CAN EXPECT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND I KNOW FOR SURE IT WILL DIE ON ME IF I FILL IT UP.     IF I ONLY PUT IN 3/4 OF A TANK OF GAS OR LESS, I AM SAFE BUT IF I LET THE PUMP KICK OFF ON ITS OWN, I'M IN TROUBLE.    THE ONLY THING THE VAPOR CANISTER DID WAS STOP IT FROM JUMPING AND JERKING, ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS ARE STILL THERE.     THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IN TRAFFIC.  *TR",

IN THE END THE THIRD MECHANIC QUOTED ME $1800 FOR A NEW GAS TANK + LINES + LABOR, OR I COULD NOT FILL MY TANK TO THE TOP WHEN I GET GAS.  THANKS CHRYSLER!     PLUS, THE SHIFTER FOR THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ON THE 300C WILL LOCK UP, NOT LETTING THE DRIVER SHIFT FROM PARK TO DRIVE.  THANKS AGAIN CHRYSLER FOR STRANDING MY PREGNANT WIFE!     (I STILL HAVE THE SHIFTER IN MY GARAGE HOPING THAT WILL BE A RECALL).  *TR",

SEEMS THE VALVE WAS STUCK OPEN AND ALLOWING GAS TO OVERFLOW INTO THE CANISTER. SINCE THE VALVE IS PART OF THE TANK AND CANNOT BE REPLACED A COMPLETE TANK IS NEEDED AT A COST OF $1200 TO $1500. THE NEXT WEEK I CALLED THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT WHITTEN BROTHERS, [XXX] , AND TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD AND ORDER THE TANK. SHE SAID IT WOULD TAKE 3-5 DAYS TO BE RECEIVED AND WOULD CALL ME WHEN IT WAS IN.

I HAD THIS HAPPEN A FEW MORE TIMES AND HAD ATTRIBUTED IT TO \"BAD GAS\" UNTIL I FOUND OUT ABOUT A FAULTY FUEL TANK/VAPOR PART IN CAR. I TOOK THE CAR TO CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND PAID $130.00 TO DIAGNOSE PROBLEM. RODE WITH SERVICE TECHNICIAN TO REFUEL CAR AND SHOW HIM THE PROBLEM. HE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE, VERIFIED MY COMPLAINT, THEN GAVE ME THE ESTIMATE OF COST TO REPLACE FUEL TANK. CHRYSLER CORP. HAS OFFERED A 25% DISCOUNT TO HELP WITH REPLACEMENT OF ENTIRE FUEL TANK. THE WHOLE FUEL TANK NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE FAULTY PART IS BUILT INTO IT. THE COST QUOTE FROM THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, PARTS AND LABOR IS $1,350.00. THE PRICE OF THE FUEL TANK ONLY, NO LABOR IS $905.00. THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY CHRYSLER 100%, THE FUEL TANK DID NOT WEAR OUT OR FAIL, THE PART THEY BUILT INTO IT FAILED. IT MAY APPEAR BY THE YEAR MODEL, (2006) THAT THIS AN OLDER MODEL BEGINNING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE, CAR HAS BEEN KEPT UP WITH REGULAR SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE AND IS IN OTHERWISE MINT CONDITION.I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AND NOW I AM AWARE THAT I CANNOT FILL MY FUEL TANK TO CAPACITY WITHOUT HAVING THIS ISSUE RE OCCUR.

THE TOTAL OF THIS ATTEMPT TO REPAIR WAS $379.45. THE CAR IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO STALL AGAIN SO I RETURNED IT.  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS WITH THEIR COMPUTER HOOKED UP TO IT THEN ADVISED THAT THE PCM NEEDED REPLACED  THIS REPAIR COST A TOTAL OF $1,018.61. THE CAR WAS ON EMPTY SO HE OFFERED TO STOP FOR GAS.  HE FILLED THE TANK UP THEN PULLED OUT TO 5 LANES OF TRAFFIC AND STALLED.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESTART FOR SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY WRECKER AFTER THE VEHICLE.  THEY HAD THE CAR FOR ONE NIGHT AND CALLED US TO PICK UP AND RUN THE GAS OUT TO 1/4TANK.  WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD NOT STALL AGAIN BECAUSE THEY HAD DISCONNECTED THE EMISSIONS SYSTEM.  WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON A VERY BUSY 7 LANE HWY WITH MY DAUGHTER AND 3 MONTH OLD GRANDDAUGHTER THE CAR CAME TO A DEAD STOP IN 40MPH TRAFFIC. I WAS TERRIFIED BUT WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO THE CENTER LANE. THEY HAVE NOW CALLED AND ADVISED ANOTHER SENSOR MUST BE REPLACED. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET INJURED OR KILLED IN THIS CAR.  *TR",

CAME OUT STARTED CAR WAS PULLING OUT OF LOT INTO TRAFFIC AND CAR SHUTS DOWN AGAIN. THIS TIME NOT TO THE LIKING OF OTHER DRIVERS OR MYSELF. RESTARTED AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS DROVE HOME AND DID NOT HAPPEN AGAIN TILL I WENT ON A TRIP A FEW MONTHS LATER. HALF WAY THROUGH THE TRIP I HAD TO REFUEL AND BINGO IT HAPPENED AGAIN AFTER PULLING OUT OF GAS STATION LOT AND TURNING LEFT INTO TRAFFIC. THIS IS NOT GOOD. I WAS ABLE TO RESTART AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES AND CONTINUED MY TRIP ON INTERSTATE WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN OK UNTIL JUST TWO DAYS AGO THE 28TH OF DECEMBER 2013. IT HAPPENED AGAIN, AFTER FILLING UP AND TURNING LEFT AT SLOW SPEED CAR SHUT DOWN WHILE PULLING INTO A LOT. IT FINALLY RESTARTED AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. AFTER READING ON LINE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. WHEN IT HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME I TOOK TO DEALER, THAT I WILL NEVER TAKE IT TO AGAIN. SHORT STORY IS THEY WANTED TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION AT THE TUNE OF $4500.00. I LEFT THERE AND DROVE TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP WHO DIAGNOSED AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH TRANSMISSION. PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GETTING WORST AND AFRAID TO FILL UP AND PULL OUT INTO TRAFFIC. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL TANK AND RELATED COMPONENTS. PLEASE CHRYSLER FIX THIS PROBLEM, I LOVE MY 300C.  *TR",

THE CAR WILL THEN COME BACK TO LIFE AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE NORMALLY BUT CAN \"DIE\" AGAIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER OR NOT AT ALL FOR DAYS OR MONTHS.  IT FEELS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC ISSUE BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY HAS THERE IS NO COMMON CHARACTERISTIC BETWEEN EACH INCIDENT AND THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THAT CAUSES IT. THE ISSUE IS INTERMITTENT DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN BUT HAPPENS OFTEN ENOUGH THAT IT IS A CONCERN. SOME DAYS IT WILL HAPPEN REPEATEDLY THEN NOT HAPPEN FOR MONTHS. LATELY IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY    I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE. THE FIRST TIME THEY FOUND NO CODES AND COULD NOT DETERMINE THERE WAS AN ISSUE AS THE ISSUE IS INTERMITTENT. THE SECOND TIME I HAD A ENGINE LIGHT AND THEY FOUND A CODE FOR TCM SENSOR BUT STATED THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM. THEY SAID I HAD TOO MUCH TRANSMISSION FLUID THAT CAUSED A SENSOR TO MALFUNCTION, THEY REMOVED THE EXCESS FLUID BUT THE ISSUE HAS STILL PERSISTED. THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT DID NOT TRIGGER ANY CODES.   *TR",

THE MORE FREQUENT PROBLEM, IS THE CAR COMPLETELY CUTTING OFF WHILE EITHER AT IDLE, OR TRAVELING AT A LOWER SPEED. BOTH SITUATIONS HAPPEN ALMOST ALWAYS DIRECTLY AFTER I PUT GAS IN MY CAR. THIS HAPPENS SO MUCH THAT IT IS BECOMING UNBEARABLE. SOMETIME IT STARTS BACK UP, AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE OR TWO. IT'S RIDICULOUS. I DON'T MIND PAYING TO HAVE MY CAR SERVICED.

IT HAD LESS THAN 33,000 MILES AND WAS IN GREAT CONDITION. WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS CAR FOR ABOUT THE FIRST YEAR, BUT THEN THE TROUBLE STARTED AND IT IS NOW AN ONGOING NIGHTMARE. IT STARTED STALLING AND DYING CONSTANTLY, USUALLY WHEN WE WERE GOING SLOW OR STOP AND GO, BUT A FEW TIMES WHEN DRIVING 35-45 MPH. WE HAD PURCHASED A 2 YEAR/20,000 ADDED WARRANTY WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR (EXPIRES IN NOV 2013 WHICH HAS ME WORRIED) SO ALL OF THE SERVICING AND REPAIRS HAVE BEEN DONE AT OUR LOCAL DEALER. SO FAR, THEY HAVE DONE THROTTLE BODY CLEAN, CLEANED A/F BOX AND REPLACED FILTER, COOLANT FLUSH, STEERING SYSTEM FLUSH, FUEL KIT, CHANGED OUT FUEL TANK, VAPOR CANISTER, LEAK DETECTION PUMP FILTER, NEW FACTORY BATTERY, COMPLETE TUNE UP, OIL CHANGES, AND MORE. NOT ALL OF THIS WAS COVERED BY THE WARRANTY, SO WE HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF OUR OWN MONEY ON REPAIRS AND RENTAL CAR ALL THE TIMES IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP SINCE IT IS OUR ONLY CAR. ON OCTOBER 16, WE HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER BECAUSE IT WAS DYING AGAIN AND WOULDN'T STAY CRANKED ONCE PUT IN GEAR AND START MOVING. AS OF THIS MORNING, STILL NO WORD FROM THEM ON WHAT THEY THINK IT IS THIS TIME, AND YET ANOTHER RENTAL BILL WHILE WE WAIT. IN THE TWO YEARS WE HAVE HAD THIS CAR, WE HAVE ONLY PUT ABOUT 10,000 MILES ON IT, IT HAS LESS THAN 43,000 MILES. THIS CAR HAS WAY TOO FEW MILES AND HAS BEEN TOO WELL TAKEN CARE OF FOR IT TO BE HAVING THIS MANY PROBLEMS. ALL THE THINGS THEY HAVE DONE AND ITS STILL DOING THE SAME THING!  THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE WHEN IT DIES, YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TO NONE OF THE STEERING AND BRAKES.  LUCKILY, WE HAVE NOT HAD IT DIE IN MAJOR TRAFFIC YET, BUT I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT NOW FOR FEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A WRECK BECAUSE OF IT.  *TR",

IT IS A FACTORY DESIGN ERROR THAT ONLY BE CORRECTED BY THE FUEL TANK REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS THE PURGE VALVE.

ON THIS SITE OTHER CHRYSLER OWNERS STRESS THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM JUST HAPPENS OUT OF THE BLUE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. IT COSTS $490 TO GET IT FIXED PLUS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WILL COST YOU TO GET YOUR VEHICLE CHRYSLER 300 TOWED. THE OTHER CHRYSLER OWNERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEY'VE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH 2005, 2006, AND 2007 CHRYSLER 300 TOURING MODELS.

ALL I GOT WAS THE RUN AROUND AND I STRESSED THE ISSUE AS FAR AS THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM BEING RECALLED AND IT HADN'T BEEN.

WHILE STILL ROLLING FORWARD I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE ENGINE.  I ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN RESTARTING THE CAR WHILE IT WAS ROLLING FORWARD.  HOWEVER, THE STALLING WOULD REPEAT ITSELF TWO TO THREE MORE TIMES BEFORE THE CAR STOPPED DOING THIS.  I REPORTED THIS TO MY DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HAD NO SOLUTIONS.  AFTER MONTHS OF REPEATED EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM I STARTED TO FILL MY TANK ONLY TO ABOUT 3/4TH FULL AND THE STALLING WAS SOLVED.  HOWEVER, AFTER HITTING SOME ROUGH ROAD AFTER A 3/4TH FILLING (THE GASOLINE GOT SLOSHED ABOUT, I AM SURE),THE ENGINE STALLED ON ME.  ON JUNE 12, 2012 I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP, OVERLAND PARK JEEP, CHRYSLER, DODGE, IN OVERLAND PARK, KS TO START REPLACING GASOLINE TANK PARTS. THEY INSTALLED A 4891427AB DETECTOR-NATURAL VACUUM DETECTI....., A SOLENOID-PROPORTIONAL PURGE AND A CANISTER-VAPOR. (THEIR INVOICE #429537).  THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE STALLING PROBLEM.  ON MARCH 26, 2013 I FINALLY GAVE UP ON THE PROBLEM AND ASKED OPJCD TO REPLACE THE SADDLE-BAG GASOLINE TANKS.  THEIR INVOICE 452851 COVERED THE INSTALLATION OF A 68051891 AA TANK-FUEL, O-RING-FUEL PUMP AND LEVEL UNIT.  WITH THREE COMPLETE GASOLINE TANK FILL UP'S I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH STALLING.  I AM WRITING TO YOU AFTER READING, IN THIS MORNINGS NEWSPAPER, ABOUT SIMILAR PROBLEMS BEING LOOKED INTO BY YOUR AGENCY AND I WANTED TO REPORT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND WHAT I DID ABOUT IT.  OPJCD SERVICE MAN TOLD ME THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR MY EXPENSES IF A RECALL WAS MADE ON MY CAR.  I PAID A TOTAL OF $1,453.90 TO GET MY 2006 CHRYSLER 300C, I HOPE, FIXED.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

I THOUGHT THAT THIS HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM SO I TRIED TO FILL THE TANK UP ALL THE WAY AGAIN AND IT IMMEDIATELY CUT OFF AFTER STARTING IT UP. I WAS ABLE TO REV THE ENGINE AND USE UP SOME OF THE GAS AND MANAGED TO GET THE CAR HOME WITH THE RPMS CONSTANTLY DIPPING ALMOST TO ZERO. THE CAR CUT OUT AT A STOP LIGHT AND I THEN HAD TO GET IT STARTED AGAIN AFTER SITTING IN THE INTERSECTION STALLED.    I'VE HAD MY CAR INSPECTED BY TWO CHRYSLER DEALERS, A FEW INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOPS, AND ALSO A NISSAN DEALER WHERE I KNOW THE HEAD MECHANIC. THE ONLY ANSWERS I'VE GOTTEN WERE THAT IT IS A FAULTY O2 SENSOR AND NEEDS A NEW GAS TANK.   *TR",

ACCORDING TO YOUTUBE.COM [HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=8UAMY_M7TTK], THIS SEEMS TO OCCUR ON 2006 AND 2007 MODELS.  I AM NOT CERTAIN, BUT 2008 AND NEWER MODELS HAVE A PART THAT IS GREEN AND DOES NOT SEEM AS LIKELY TO BREAK.  FURTHERMORE, MILEAGE OR AGE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A FACTOR.  MINE BROKE BEFORE 75,000 MILES AND SLIGHTLY AFTER 6 YEARS. DORMAN MAKES AN METAL ALUMINUM REPLACEMENT PART RANGING FROM $22 TO $40 DEPENDING ON THE RETAILER.  ONLINE IS LESS EXPENSIVE.  THE FACT THAT THERE IS A METAL, DURABLE REPLACEMENT PART IS EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS AN INCREASING PROBLEM.  MOREOVER, IT IS BELIEVED THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS FAILED TO RECALL ITS VEHICLES.  FURTHERMORE, AFTER CALLING CHRYSLER 800 CUSTOMER SERVICE # (REFERENCE #22152872), I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY SPECIFIC CAR, THAT CHRYSLER WOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER COVERING THE COST UNLESS I FIRST WENT TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AT WHICH A CERTIFIED CHRYSLER MECHANIC WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM THAT THE PINK PLASTIC SHIFT INTERLOCK LATCH WAS THE ISSUE.  DIAGNOSTIC ALONE COSTS $150, BUT MAY BE APPLIED TO REPAIRS. I THEN CALLED THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP IN TUSTIN, CA AND A SERVICING MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUE, BUT HAD YET TO SEE CHRYSLER COVER THE ESTIMATED $500 COST EVEN THOUGH THE REPLACEMENT PART IS $22 TO $40.

MEANWHILE THE CAR WOULD START AND APPEARED TO RUN OK SO WE LEFT THE SHOP AND WITHIN A MILE THE CAR STARTED TO SPUTTER AND WE PULLED OVER ON THE ROAD BUT THEN MANAGED TO GET THE CAR BACK HOME.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A WEEK AND DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  ON NOVEMBER 3, 2011 MY WIFE HAD A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT AND AS SHE PULLED INTO THE DOCTOR PARKING LOT THE CHRYSLER JUST DIED.  SHE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THE CAR STARTED AND SHE WAS ABLE TO PARK IT.  AFTER HER APPOINTMENT SHE WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR AND DRIVE IT HOME AND IT ALMOST STOPPED AGAIN BEFORE SHE GOT HOME.  WE CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER AND THEY ASKED ME TO BRING THE  CAR IN FOR INSPECTION AND I REFUSED, AS I DID NOT WANT THE CAR TO STOP ON ME ON THE FREEWAY. FINALLY THEY AGREED TO HAVE THE CAR PICKED UP AND DELIVERED TO THEIR SHOP AT THEIR EXPENSE.  THE CHRYSLER WAS PURCHASED NEW IN DECEMBER OF 2005 AS A 2006 MODEL AND NOW HAS APPROXIMATELY 63,000 MILES.  WE PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND IT HAS HAD ALL THE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE BY THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER FROM DAY ONE.  BASED ON ALL THE OTHER POSTS ON THE NHTSA SITE ABOUT THE STALLING PROBLEM I HAVE A LOW CONFIDENCE OF GETTING THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED TO OUR SATISFACTION.  *TR",

MY DEALERSHIP CLOSED AND I WAS INFORMED BY CHRYSLER THAT WARRANTY PERIOD ENDED. IT WAS A HUGE BLOW FINANCIALLY BUT I MANAGED TO HAVE A REBUILT ENGINE INSTALLED AT A COST OF $5,000. I HAD OIL CHANGED EVERY 4000 TO 6000 MILES BUT DESPITE THAT MY ENGINE HAS FAILED AGAIN AT 83,000 MILES. THE MECHANIC SAID MY OIL, COOLANT LEVELS WERE FINE BUT THE 300 IS NOTORIOUS FOR THIS. I?M BEYOND BELIEF TO NEED A 3RD ENGINE FOR A CAR I STILL OWE MONEY ON. LOOKING ONLINE TO SEE IF OTHERS HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS, I FOUND HUNDREDS OF OWNERS ON BLOGS, FACE BOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE 2006 2.7L 300. I CAN NOT BELIEVE A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN DONE. MANY PEOPLE THINK THE BBB IN A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION BUT THEY COLLECT FEES, RARELY LOWERING RATING OF COMPANIES WHO PAY THEM. DESPITE THE FACT FORD SELLS MORE CARS , CHRYSLER HAS CLOSE TO 10 TIMES THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS NOT RESOLVED TO OWNERS SATISFACTION. 10 X! I ASK THE NHTSA TO LOOK INTO HOW THE BBB CAN JUSTIFY THE SAME RATING WITH SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN UNRESOLVED COMPLAINTS. THE 2006 CHRYSLER 300 HAS A ENGINE THAT EASILY FAILS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS, WITH FAR MORE MILES AND NEVER REPLACED A SEIZED ENGINE. NOW I HAVE 2006 300, PURCHASED BRAND NEW, THAT FAILED AT 43,000 AND NOW AGAIN AT 83,000! I KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR MY VEHICLE, ROUTINE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, BUT CHRYSLER SEEMS TO PUT ALL THE BLAME ON OWNERS. PLEASE DO WHAT YOUR ORGANIZATION WAS INTENDED AND HELP TO MAKE SURE OTHERS DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME.

I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP AND THE MECHANIC CONFIRMED THAT A PISTON AND VALVE BLEW CAUSING THE ENGINE TO FAIL AND THE ENTIRE ENGINE WILL NEED TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED AT A COST OF $8,500.00. THE MECHANIC ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF WEAR AND TEAR THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS AND EVEN MENTIONED THAT HE NOTICED THAT THE CAR HAD FULL SYNTHETIC OIL THAT WAS CLEAN AND WASN'T DUE FOR A CHANGE FOR ANOTHER 2,500 MILES PER CHRYSLER'S RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE. I HAVE ALL THE RECEIPTS FROM MY PAST OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL.   I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER REGARDING THIS DEFECT AND IT APPEARS THEY ARE NOT VERY SHOCKED AT ALL AS IF IT WAS SOMETHING THEY FORESEEN HAPPENING. I AM ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CONTACT SOMEONE WITH SOME AUTHORITY AT THE COMPANY TO EXPLAIN THIS ISSUE AND DISCUSS A RESOLUTION. I HAVE WRITTEN THEIR CEO AND THEIR CHIEF OF CUSTOMER CARE AND QUALITY A LETTER AND AN E-MAIL ABOUT THIS OVER A WEEK AGO AND NEITHER HAS RESPONDED. WHAT KIND OF CHIEF OF CUSTOMER CARE AND QUALITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN TALKING TO A REAL CHRYSLER CUSTOMER REGARDING AN ISSUE OF QUALITY?   PLEASE HELP ME IN CREATING AWARENESS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS I DO BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HAD THIS ENGINE FAILURE OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND NOT IN THE PARKING LOT OF A HARDWARE STORE. IMAGINE THE DANGER IN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MILES PER HOUR AND SPONTANEOUSLY BLOWING A PISTON AND THE ENGINE BECOMING COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL AND POSSIBLY BLOWING UP ENTIRELY WHILE MOVING AT THOSE SPEEDS WITH OTHER CARS AROUND YOU.

UPON TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR, I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYLSER REPLACED THE LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WITH A SMALL LIGHT ON THE CONTROL STALK THAT OPERATES THE CRUISE CONTROL.

I ASK WHETHER THE NHTSA APPROVED CHRYLER'S REPOSITIONING AND REDESIGN  OF THE CRUISE CONTROL LIGHT.  IF THE CHANGE DID NOT RECEIVE THE PROPER APPROVAL, I AM ASKING THAT A RECALL ORDER BB ISSUED, FORCING CHRYSLER TO INSTALL THE CRUISE CONTROL LIGHT WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE POSITIONED.

EXPERIENCE FROM DRIVING IN ALASKA ON ICE, I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CALMNESS AND NOT SLAM ON BRAKES AND KEEP THE CAR UNDER CONTROL. THE CAR RESTED IN THE TURNING LANE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  I KNOW THE  OTHER DRIVERS WAS AS SCARED AS I WAS NOT KNOWING IF I WAS GOING TO SLAM INTO THEM BECAUSE I WAS SO OUT OF CONTROL. I CONTACTED MIKE AN ENGINEER AT CHRYSLER'S HEADQUARTERS AND LEFT HIM A MESSAGE AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND TO THIS DATE HE HAS NOT RESPONDED. I HAVE A HISTORY WITH THEM BECAUSE MY CAR ALSO SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING. CHRYSLER FLEW A TEAM OF ENGINEERS IN FOR A WEEK TO CHECK OUT THE CAR, BUT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD UNTIL THE CAR STOPS RUNNING OR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS IT'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO, BUT THEY WILL COVER THE COST OF REPAIRS ONCE THE PROBLEM IS FOUND. I HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE THE LOSS OF LIFE BEFORE THEY WILL ISSUE A RECALL ON THESE CARS. MAYBE IF WE ALL SENT LETTERS TO THE CEO SOMETHING WILL BE DONE BEFORE WE HAVE ANOTHER TOYOTA CRISIS.

I WENT TO A DIFFERENT CONTINENTAL DEALER FROM THE SITE, WHO PULLED OFF TIRES, NOTICED 1 TIRE HAD 2 SEVERE SPOTS OF SEPARATION & 3 WERE EGG SHAPED.  I WAS INFORMED BY DEALERS THAT CONTISEAL TIRES ALL HAVE POOR LIFE & THE PUNCTURE SEALANT CAUSES THEM TO NEVER STAY IN BALANCE, THUS CAUSING ABNORMAL WEAR & SEPARATION. CONTINENTAL OFFERED 50PERCENT GOODWILL RATE SAYING I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THOUGH TIRES RATED 60K THEY SAID IT DOES NOT APPLY TO NEW CARS. ALSO TOLD THEY DISCONTINUED THIS BRAND OF TIRE AND \"HAD NEW IMPROVED REPLACEMENT SERIES\" BECAUSE THEY FOUND HEMI ENGINE CARS ARE TOO HEAVY FOR CONTISEAL SOFT TIRES. I AM ANGRY IT COST ME $400 TO REPLACE TIRES THAT HAD 30 PERCENT USAGE, AS WELL AS BOTH DEALERS SAID ONE TIRE WAS READY TO SEPARATE AT ANY MINUTE & DIDN'T EVEN WANT ME TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME BECAUSE OF THE DANGER.  I DO FREEWAY DRIVING AND HAVE AN INFANT IN THE BACK SEAT!!  I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS POORLY DESIGNED TIRE & RECALL ISSUED. WHY SHOULD CONSUMERS HAVE TO SHELL OUT MONEY FOR TIRES THAT SHOULD HAVE YEARS OF LIFE LEFT??  I EVEN ASKED CONTINENTAL CUST. SERV. WHY THE 50% RATING, AND HE SAID BECAUSE 1 TIRE HAD THE SEPARATION & THE REST ONLY HAD STARTED THE PROCESS WHICH ONLY MADE MY \"DRIVE ROUGH\".. I ASKED \"IF\" IT HAD SEPARATED ON FREEWAY WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE DONE, AND HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.  I AM APPALLED AT THE DANGER OF THESE TIRES. I HAVE READ COMPLAINTS & THERE IS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY & I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ACTION TAKEN ON THIS COMPANY & MODEL OF TIRE. IT IS SIMPLY TOO DANGEROUS & ADMITTEDLY SO BY THE COMPANY'S REPS BY STATING THE TIRES IS TOO SOFT FOR HEMI ENGINES & THIS A COMMON PROBLEM. *TR",
