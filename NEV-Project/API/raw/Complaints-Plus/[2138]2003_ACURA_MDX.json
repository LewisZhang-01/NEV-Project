I'M CONFUSED.  THIS PARTICULAR YEAR/MODEL SRS UNIT IS BEING RECALLED/REPLACED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE THREATENING DEPLOYMENT PROBLEMS.  IN ADDITION THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MODEL'S AIRBAG SYSTEM CLEARLY INDICATING THAT THERE WERE/ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE 2003 ACURA MDX.    FORTUNATELY, MY SRS UNIT IN QUESTION WAS REPLACED (FOR NOTED DEFECTS) PRIOR TO A DISASTROUS DEPLOYMENT.

I ALSO DISCOVERED A SIMILAR HOLE IN MY JACKET. I TURNED OFF THE SEAT HEATER.  3. ON MARCH 23 I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE LOCAL DEALER WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED AND TO ACURA CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE DEALER TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO BECAUSE I WAS OFF WARRANTY, BUT HE WOULD REPLACE THE HEATER AND REPAIR LEATHER FOR $1050. I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD INVESTIGATED THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE: DID THE FUSE FAIL? WAS THE HEATING ELEMENT FAULTY? THE DEALER WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE CAUSE.  4. I WROTE A DETAILED LETTER TO THE DEALER AND ACURA CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED AND MY CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHER UNAWARE ACURA DRIVERS. THE PHONE RESPONSE I RECEIVED FROM ACURA CORPORATE WOULD NOT RESPOND TO ME REGARDING THE SAFETY ISSUE.

THEIR CONTINUED DENIAL OF PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION CONFLICTS NOT ONLY WITH MY COMPLAINTS, AND THOSE OF MANY OTHER OWNERS, BUT  THE CONCLUSIONS OF TWO INDEPENDENT MECHANICS I HAD EVALUATE THE TRANSMISSION ON MY MDX. ONE OF THESE MECHANICS IS A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AND THE OTHER HAS OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN AUTO REPAIR.
