BUT I RECENTLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY FRONT ROTORS I HAD A MITSUBISHI DEALER INSPECT MY ENTIRE SUV FOR ANY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE WRONG..JUST THE OTHER DAY I WENT TO STOP AT A RED SIGNAL AND MY SUV DID BRAKE BUT ONLY FOR A SECOND IT STARTED TO SLIDE FORWARD AS I LOST BRAKING POWER IN MY FRONT BRAKES I HEARD A BIG POP AND A CLANK AS I APPLIED MY BRAKES AND HALFWAY SLID THROUGH THE LIGHT AFTER THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I DROVE A WAYS DOWN THE ROAD AND WAS HEARING THE CLANK SOUND AND IT FELT AS IF THE FRONT TIRES WERE TRYING TO CATCH ON SOMETHING I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CALIBERS OR THE BRAKE PADS. I PULLED INTO THE CLOSEST GAS STATION TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED . THE PADS WERE FINE THE TIRES WERE FINE AND EVERYTHING LOOKED OK NO BRAKES FLUID LEAKING  THE CALIBERS WERE FINE... I SLOWLY DROVE/COASTED MY SUV TO A FRIEND'S HOME GOING ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MILES AN HOUR. I TOOK OFF THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT TIRE TO SEE IF INDEED IT WAS THE BRAKE PADS OR CALIBERS AS I WAS TAKING OFF THE TIRE I NOTICED THAT THE ROTOR HAD SPLIT IN HALF.

SHE HAD BRONCHITIS FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS THIS SPRING THAT COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED THAT THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANTIBIOTICS, STEROIDS, AND A  NEBULIZER MACHINE COULDN'T MAKE HER BETTER. NOW I KNOW WHAT CAUSED HER PROLONGED ILLNESS, DRIVING HER CAR EVERY DAY WITH MILDEW UNDER THE FLOOR MATS AND IN THE AIR. MY WHOLE FAMILY HAS EITHER ALLERGIES, ASTHMA OR BOTH. AFTER WE RETURNED FROM VACATION I GOOGLED FOR A ANSWER TO FIND WHERE THE CONDENSATION TUBE WAS LOCATED TO CLEAR IT AND POSSIBLY STOP IT FROM LEAKING INSIDE.MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THE INTERNET SEARCH RESULTED WITH A BEVY OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VERY SAME PROBLEM ! I READ FORUMS, ARTICLES, AND COMPLAINTS WITH THE END RESULT THAT MITSUBISHI WAS CHARGING $1000.00 TO FIX. SINCE THEN THEY ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN ON HOW TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITH OUT TAKING THE WHOLE A/C UNIT OUT. THERE IS A TSB REPORT # 09-55-002 ON THE PROBLEM WITH THE FINDINGS THAT INSULATION USED IN THE HOUSING FALLS APART AND CLOGS THE DRAIN INSIDE THE HOUSING.THE DESIGN OF THE A/C CONDENSER INSIDE THE VEHICLE IS ASKING FOR LEAKS AND PROBLEMS. I CAN'T EXPOSE MY FAMILY TO MOLD AND MILDEW EVERY TIME THE A/C IS USED. THE WATER IN THE CARPET SMELLS VERY BAD AND WILL RUST THE FLOORBOARDS AND THE FRAME OF THE TRUCK! THIS MAKES THE PROBLEM TWO FOLD. THE RUST IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THE MOLD IS A SEVERE HEALTH ISSUE FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WITH RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS.

TRIED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE MANAGERS BUT THEY ARE TELLING THAT MY WARRANTY IS NOT COVERED THIS PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH THAT I MADE ON THE INTERNET, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MITSUBISHI OWNERS THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH MITSIBUSHI ENDEAVOR. ALSO, IT LOOKS LIKE  IT IS A STANDING POLICY AT MITSUBISHI MOTORS TO INTENTIONALLY THIN THE CLEAR-COAT ON THEIR AUTOMOBILES IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE MONEY UP FRONT. I HOPE YOU CAN HELP US TO SOLVE THIS. THANK YOU.  *TR",
