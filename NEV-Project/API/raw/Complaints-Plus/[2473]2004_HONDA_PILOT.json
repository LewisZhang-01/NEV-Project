I wasn't sure what was happening and quickly put it in neutral. My daughter who drives the car to school was sitting in the passenger seat and was completely shocked. I have been driving for 30+ years and at that moment felt things were totally out of my control. Extremely off to see a car keep going when you are trying to stop. I could 100% have hit someone if there was a car in front of me as I went two car lengths before realizing what was happening. I turned the car off. Started again and it was fine. This happened on Saturday, March 26th, 2022. I have not taken the car to the dealer. There were no lights or anything indicating any warning.",

I ON THE RECEIPT PROVIDED IT SHOWS THAT THEY HAD PERFORMED THE AIR BAG INFLATOR SERVICE. IN EARLY FEBRUARY OF 2016 I RECEIVED ANOTHER MAILING INFORMING ME TO HAVE THIS AIRBAG SERVICE PERFORMED. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP. THE ORIGINAL SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THAT THE REPAIR ON THE AIR BAG RECALL HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED AT THE EARLIER SERVICE APPOINTMENT. HE DID NOT KNOW WHY, AND ADMITTED IT WAS A MISTAKE.   I EVENTUALLY TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER. HE OFFERED TO REPAIR THE CAR IF IT WAS BROUGHT BACK.    MY CONCERNS IN THIS CASE , IT MIGHT BE A COMMON ONE WITH THIS DEANSHIP. THEY NEVER CONTACTED ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE. I CONTACTED THEM IN FEB 16 TO FOLLOW UP ON ANOTHER  RECALL NOTICE. TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SUPPOSED AIRBAG REPAIR.THEY HAVE MY CELL NUMBER AND MAILING ADDRESS AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY PROOF THEY EVER TRIED TO CONTACT ME.  I HAVE A PHONE LOG  AND SHOW NO INCOMING CALLS FROM THEM   IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE WHEN HONDA WOULD NOT REIMBURSE THEM FOR THIS WARRANTY REPAIR BECAUSE THEY USED THE INCORRECT PART TO MAKE THE REPAIR!  THE DEALERS ACTIONS HAVE PLACED THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY RISK.  THEIR ONLY OFFER TO FIX THIS AIR BAG SERVICE MISTAKE IS TO BRING THE CAR BACK FOR SERVICE.  IF THIS WAS NOT A RECALL ITEM THAT WAS INVOLVED, I DOUBT I WOULD HAVE HEARD BACK FROM THEM. I WOULD BE DRIVING AN POTENTIALLY UNSAFE CAR, THINKING THE ISSUE HAD BEEN ADDRESSED.  THIS DEALERSHIP MISREPRESENTS THE TRUTH, IS SLOPPY IN RECORD KEEPING, AND USES INCORRECT PARTS FOR A RECALL SERVICE.",

I WAS SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT THE MIDDLE REAR PLUG WAS ONLY FINGER TIGHT AND AS A RESULT COMBUSTION GASES WERE ESCAPING BETWEEN THE PLUG AND THE HEAD.

WHEN ASKED HOW HONDA COULD KNOW THAT AS THEY DON'T KNOW THE VEHICLE CONTENT BY VIN (PER [XXX] AT THE SAME NUMBER THE DAY BEFORE), SHE COULD NOT ANSWER.    I ASKED HER IF HONDA COULD ASSIGN A CASE MANAGER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MY VEHICLE CONTAINED A TAKATA DRIVER'S AIRBAG AND SHE STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT A DEALER ON MY OWN.    WHEN ASKED IF SHE WOULD CONFIRM THIS WITH HER SUPERVISOR, SHE DID SO AND REPLIED THAT WHAT SHE HAD SAID WAS OFFICIAL HONDA POLICY. WHEN ASKED HER SUPERVISOR'S NAME SHE DECLINED STARTING THAT SHE COULD NOT REVEAL THIS INFORMATION.    WHEN INFORMED THAT A CONTEMPORANEOUS RECORD OF THIS CALL HAD BEEN TRANSCRIBED AND WOULD BE PROVIDED TO COUNSEL IN THE EVENT OF AN INCIDENT INVOLVING MY VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS SHE WAS NONCOMMITTAL.    I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS SORT OF REACTION IN THE COURSE OF A VOLUNTARY MANUFACTURER'S RECALL WILL BE NOTED BY NHTSA IN ITS REVIEW OF THIS MATTER.

BUT THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES, AS UNFORTUNATELY, MY OTHER VEHICLE IS A 2004 HONDA PILOT. RIGHT AFTER I PURCHASED IT NEW IN 2004, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER SINCE THE MODEL WAS SUBJECT TO A NEARLY IDENTICAL POWER TRAIN RECALL AS THE MDX AND ODYSSEY.  MY DEALER SAID MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, & THAT MY NEW PILOT SHOULD BE FINE. YET @ 60K, THE \"D\" LIGHT ON THE SHIFTER DISPLAY STARTED TO BLINK FROM TIME TO TIME.  EACH TIME THE DEALER SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE; SHUTTERING ON DOWNSHIFTING OVER THE YEARS WAS PASSED OFF BY THE DEALER AS NORMAL FOR THE VEHICLE. THEN LAST WEEK, THE POWER TRAIN FAILED ON THIS VEHICLE AS WELL.  THIS TIME MY SON WAS DRIVING, & THE CAR SHUTTERED SO BADLY THAT IT NEARLY WENT OUT OF CONTROL.

I DID THE OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE AT DEALERSHIP REGULARLY AND DROVE THE CAR GENTLY. I DON'T THINK THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO MY DRIVING STYLE.

IT IS A VEHICLE MY WIFE AND I LOVE BUT ONE THAT HAS HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF IRRITATING SMALL PROBLEMS. THE LATEST PROBLEM INVOLVES THE MOUNTING STRUCTURE FOR THE REAR LICENSE PLATE. THE METAL HOLDING THE TWO WELDED ON MOUNTING NUTS IS SO THIN THAT AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF VIBRATING THE METAL BACKING SIMPLY BREAKS AWAY. IN SEEKING A REPAIR TO THE PROBLEM MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER HAD NO CLUE AS TO HOW TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AND HIS ONLY REMEDY WAS TO SEND ME TO A LOCAL RETAIL BODY SHOP FOR A $234.00 REPAIR. MY LOCAL DEALER INDICATES HE WAS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN REPAIR SUPPORT FROM THE FACTORY BECAUSE THESE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO 'THE USE OF HEAVY LICENSE PLATE HOLDERS'.  IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEFENSE LET ME STATE THE FOLLOWING:    1.RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET QUICKLY REVEALS THAT THE HONDA PILOTS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS. DOZENS OF HONDA OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  2.HONDA REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVES HAVE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY IN SOME CASES AND NOT IN OTHERS.  3.THE 'HEAVY LICENSE PLATE FRAME' BEING BLAMED IS AN ITEM SUPPLIED BY THE DEALER AT TIME OF PURCHASE AND DOES NOT REPRESENT AN EXTRA HEAVY BURDEN.  4.THE LICENSE PLATE HAS VIBRATED UPON CLOSING THE REAR HATCH FROM DAY ONE OF PURCHASE. IT IS THE NATURE OF THE DESIGN USING ONLY TWO MOUNTING POINTS.  5.THE FACT THAT THE LICENSE PLATE AND FRAME CAN SUDDENLY FALL FROM THE VEHICLE AND BOUNCE INTO THE FOLLOWING TRAFFIC REPRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD WHICH HONDA SHOULD HAVE WARNED OWNERS OF WHEN THEY FIRST DISCOVERED THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

THIS IS ALARMING AND I AM CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MANY OTHER FAMILIES (INCLUDING MY FRIENDS) WHO DRIVE THE PILOT.  THE REASON WE PURCHASED THE PILOT WAS TO TRANSPORT OUR FOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR FRIENDS.      NHTSA RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 04V176000      COMPONENT: POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION      DETAILS: ON SOME MINI VANS, SPORT UTILITY AND PASSENGER VEHICLES, CERTAIN OPERATING CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN HEAT BUILD-UP BETWEEN THE COUNTERSHAFT AND SECONDARY SHAFT SECOND GEARS IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO GEAR TOOTH CHIPPING OR GEAR BREAKAGE.      CONSEQUENCE: GEAR FAILURE COULD RESULT IN TRANSMISSION LOCKUP, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH.      CORRECTIVE ACTION: ON VEHICLES WITH 15,000 MILES OR LESS, THE DEALER WILL UPDATE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A SIMPLE REVISION TO THE OIL COOLER RETURN LINE TO INCREASE LUBRICATION TO THE SECOND GEAR. ON VEHICLES WITH MORE THAN 15,000 MILES, THE DEALER WILL INSPECT THE TRANSMISSION TO IDENTIFY GEARS THAT HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED DISCOLORATION DUE TO OVERHEATING. IF DISCOLORATION EXISTS, THE TRANSMISSION WILL BE REPLACED IF DISCOLORATION IS NOT PRESENT, THE DEALER WILL PERFORM THE REVISION TO THE OIL COOLER RETURN LINE. THE RECALL BEGAN ON APRIL 21, 2004, FOR PILOT, ODYSSEY, AND MDX OWNERS. OWNERS OF THE ACCORD VEHICLES WILL START RECEIVING LETTERS ON JUNE 28, 2004, AND ON JUNE 29, 2004, FOR OWNERS OF THE TL AND CL VEHICLES.

A LITTLE BACKGROUND:  THE CAR IS A HONDA CERTIFIED CAR- 2004 PILOT I BOUGHT 2 YEARS AGO.  AS A CONDITION OF THE SALE, THE DEALER (SAM SWOPE IN LOUISVILLE, KY) SAID THEY WOULD FIX A SHIMMY IN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND A GRINDING OF THE BRAKES.  THEY SAID IT WAS A MINOR PROBLEM.      THE BRAKES WERE REPAIRED 2 WEEKS BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK 4 DAYS LATER AND THE ROTORS WERE RESURFACED.  EVERYTHING WAS FINE FOR A COUPLE OF  WEEKS, AND THEN THE PROBLEM STARTED COMING BACK- SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.      3 MONTHS LATER THEY RESURFACED THE ROTORS.  THE SAME PROBLEM PROGRESSED AGAIN, AND 3 MONTHS LATER, THEY REPLACED THE REAR BRAKE PADS AND RESURFACED THE ROTORS AGAIN.      I PUT UP WITH A SHIMMY IN THE WHEEL AS THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN .  FINALLY, AFTER ABOUT 8 MONTHS, MY WIFE COULDN'T TAKE THE SHIMMY ANY MORE AND MADE ME TAKE IT IN AGAIN.  I WAS RELUCTANT BECAUSE EACH TIME I TOOK IT IN NOTHING HAPPENED, AND I'D ALREADY SPENT OVER $700 TO NO AVAIL.      ONCE AGAIN THE ROTORS WERE RESURFACED, THE FRONT PADS WERE REPLACED AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE DRUM WAS TURNED.  TWO MONTHS LATER I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, AND WAS TOLD THE ROTORS NEED TO BE RESURFACED AGAIN.     I CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE ON 4/21/09, TALKED TO TINA AND SHE SAID I WOULD LIKELY BE DENIED ANY HELP BY WALTER MENIGVAR THE EXEC. REVIEW MANAGER BECAUSE HONDA CORPORATE CONSIDERS THE BRAKES TO BE A REPAIR ITEM.    I BELIEVE THERE IS AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AND POSSIBLY IT'S DESIGN, AS I HAVE DRIVEN NUMEROUS CARS OVER 29 YEARS- MANY OF THOSE MILES IN THE MOUNTAINS OF WVA, AND HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM OF THIS SORT.
