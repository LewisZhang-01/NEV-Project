CURT CONTROLLER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRAKE LIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, REVERSE LIGHTS, BASICALLY ANY EXTERNAL SAFETY LIGHTING ON THE RV THAT INDICATES YOU'RE STOPPING OR TURNING.  FOREST RIVER PLACED THE CURT CONTROLLER ON THE REAR BUMPER, DIRECTLY BEHIND THE WHEELS WHERE ROAD SPRAY WILL GET DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE ELECTRICAL.  THE MANUFACTURER OF THE CURT CONTROLLER SPECIFICALLY STATES ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN A DRY INTERNAL AREA OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS ALL THE LIGHTS JUST COME ON AT ONCE AND DON'T TURN OFF UNLESS YOU PULL OUT THE FUSE.  THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CURT CONTROLLER TO DRY OUT BEFORE IT WORKS NORMALLY AGAIN.  WE'VE ASKED FOREST RIVER TO FIX THE DESIGN AND TO DATE THEY HAVE DECLINED.",
