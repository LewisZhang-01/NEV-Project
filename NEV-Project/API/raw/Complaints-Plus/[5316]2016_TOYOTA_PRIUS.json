I've also conducted extensive research on this issue and it is a common problem encountered by other Gen4 Prius owners. Toyota even issued a TSB for this issue in December of 2018 (T-SB-0157-18), NHTSA No. 10153229. My car had its powertrain warranty lapse earlier this year, but I know for a fact that this has been covered out of warranty because I've corresponded with other Prius owners who had Toyota cover the repair of this defect/glitch.   I am trying to avoid a catastrophic breakdown of my CV joint if I'm driving on the highway and I'd appreciate it if NHTSA would be able to compel Toyota to help with the repair of this issue. I've had no luck dealing with either the dealership, or the corporate office at Toyota. They do not seem to be taking any ownership of this issue nor taking demonstrating any accountability.",

The crack was not present when I last drove the car last night. Based on some online research for windshield replacement cost, I've learned that Toyota was faced with a class action lawsuit regarding 2016-17 Toyota Prius containing defective windshields; in which these windshields are known to unexpectedly crack while parked or under ordinary driving conditions. Furthermore, my Toyota Prius is equipped with safety features (such as pre-collision system, lane departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams and full-speed dynamic radar cruise control) that require a front camera to function properly. The cracked windshield now interferes with the camera's visibility, line of sight and perceived orientation, thus causing me to feel unsafe while driving the vehicle.   I am filing this compliant because I am now faced with not only an unsafe vehicle to operate, but also the cost to fix a windshield that is known to be defective from Toyota.",

        "summary": "OUR 2016 PRIUS 2 SEDAN WINDSHIELD WAS STRUCK BY A SMALL ROCK CAST LATERALLY ACROSS THE FREEWAY FROM SEVERAL LANES TO MY RIGHT, AS ONE WOULD SKIP A STONE ACROSS WATER, TRAVELING ABOUT 55MPH. UNFORESEEABLE, UNAVOIDABLE ACT OF CHANCE, KICKED UP BY ANOTHER CAR'S TIRE. INITIAL DAMAGE (SEE PHOTO SERIES) WAS TWO UNSIGHTLY BUT REPAIRABLE CRATERS IN THE OUTER LAYER OF GLASS. WITHIN MINUTES / BEFORE AN EPOXY REPAIR WAS POSSIBLE, TWO CRACKS GREW AT AN ALARMING RATE. A SMALLER CRACK WENT VERTICALLY, AND A FAST AND LARGE CRACK RAN HORIZONTALLY. WITHIN A DAY IT SPANNED THE ENTIRE DRIVER'S SIDE. THE CRACK REFLECTS AND REFRACTS LIGHT INTO THE DRIVER'S EYES, AND IS THICK ENOUGH TO OBSTRUCT VISION EVEN IN DIM LIGHT. OUR PRIMARY TRAVEL IS EAST IN THE MORNING AND WEST AT NIGHT, SO THE OBSTRUCTION OF VISION IS AN ACTIVE DANGER AS WE ARE TYPICALLY ORIENTED ON THE SUN.  I WAS ADVISED BY THREE DIFFERENT GLASS SERVICES THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE NO AFTERMARKET WINDSHIELD AVAILABLE, BUT THAT THERE WAS AN UNKNOWN WAIT TIME TO RECEIVE ONE FROM THE ONLY AVAILABLE SOURCE, TOYOTA. THERE IS NO INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY AND I WAS QUOTED REPLACEMENT COSTS OF $800-$900, NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.     I HAVE REVIEWED THE FORUMS, NHTSA SITE, AND A PROMINENT COMPLAINT SITE, AND EXCESSIVE CRACKING APPEARS TO BE A FREQUENT FLAW, BOTH FROM DEBRIS IMPACTS AND WHEN OWNERS REPORT \"SPONTANEOUS\" CRACKING.  OUR GLASS SHOPS STATED THEY SAW THIS PROBLEM MORE FREQUENTLY ON TOYOTAS THAN ON ANY OTHER CAR. GIVEN THE COST AND FREQUENCY THIS PROBLEM IS REPORTED, I AM HESITANT TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD UNTIL I GET A REASONABLE RESPONSE FROM THE DEALER, AS IT OTHERWISE SEEMS LIKELY TO RECUR. THIS IS NOT A ONE-OFF PROBLEM. DEALER WON'T RETURN CALLS. GLASS SERVICE STILL HAS NO ETA ON REPLACEMENTS.     WE WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PROBLEM IS SO COMMON. THANK YOU.",

I COULD NOT AVOID IT SINCE IT WAS A \"LAST SECOND\" SITUATION. MY CURRENT SPEED WAS 50 MPH IN A 70 MPH ZONE BECAUSE TRAFFIC IN THE LEFT LANE WAS MOVING SLOWER THAT IT SHOULD HENCE WHY I MOVED FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT LANE. WHAT I AM TRYING TO REPORT IS THAT I BELIEVE AS WELL AS MANY OTHER 2016/2017 TOYOTA PRIUS OWNERS WHO HAVE CRACKED WINDSHIELDS, IS THAT TOYOTA IS USING WINDSHIELD GLASS THAT IS NOT UP TO CURRENT SAFETY STANDARDS. JUDGING BY THE CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD, WHICH IS NOW WELL OVER A FOOT LONG, YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH THINNER THE GLASS IS COMPARED TO OTHER CURRENT MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLES. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS DUE TO GAINING WEIGHT SAVINGS WHICH IN TURN WOULD GIVE A FEW EXTRA MPG OR NOT FOR A HYBRID VEHICLE, BUT I BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE WINDSHIELDS FOR A VEHICLE LIKE THIS ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY. UPWARDS OF $690 FROM DIFFERENT VENDORS OR $1500 FROM A TOYOTA DEALER. I HAVE OWNED 5 CARS IN THE PAST, THE TOYOTA PRIUS IS NUMBER 6, AND ALL OF THE PAST 5 VEHICLES HAVE BEEN HIT EVEN HARDER WITH BIGGER ROCKS THAN THE PRIUS WAS ON THE WINDSHIELD WITH NO CRACKS OR CHIPS. I DO HOPE THIS IS LOOKED INTO BEFORE I START PAYING HIGH AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR NEW WINDSHIELDS.",

THIS BEGAN HAPPENING INTERMITTENTLY IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER TIME. I TOOK OFF OF WORK TO HAVE THE ISSUE DIAGNOSED AND REPAIRED BY THE DEALERSHIP IN NOVEMBER AND TO HAVE THE PARKING CABLE RECALL ISSUE TAKEN CARE OF. I WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALER THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS IN TO ADDRESS THE RECALL ISSUE AND THE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE ISSUE WITH THE RADIO/NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT WAS UNABLE TO CORRECT THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE UPDATE THAT \"MIGHT\" FIX IT IS NOT AVAILABLE YET.
