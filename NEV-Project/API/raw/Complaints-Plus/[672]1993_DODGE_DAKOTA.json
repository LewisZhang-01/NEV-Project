I  TRIED SHIFTING THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION DOWN TO ANOTHER GEAR BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.  I WENT FROM PARK TO LOW AND IT ACTED LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING CONNECTED TO THE SHIFTER.   I THEN TRIED DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR AND GOT NO RESPONSE.   I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND STOPPED.  I THEN TRIED OPENING MY DRIVERS DOOR WHEN FLAMES SHOT UP BETWEEN THE DRIVERS DOOR AND THE CAB.  I TURNED OFF THE TRUCK AS SMOKE STARTED TO FILL THE CAB AND I BAILED OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR.   MY PASSENGER AND I MOVED WELL BEHIND THE PICKUP AND WATCHED AS FLAMES SHOT OUT FROM UNDER THE PICKUP AND SMOKE BILLOWED OUT OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I CALLED 911 ON MY CELL PHONE.   IN THE MEAN TIME A WITNESS HAD PULLED UP BEHIND US AND INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS TRYING TO FLAG US DOWN BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN FIRE UNDER THE TRUCK FOR AT LEAST 3 CITY BLOCKS.  I DON'T  KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE IT WAS NEW.  IT HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT.  IT IN FOR SERVICE IN DEC. OF 2000 FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND INSPECTION, NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED.  THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN OFF ROAD, FOR IT IS A TWO WHEEL DRIVE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO MAJOR MECHANICAL WORK DONE, JUST SOME MINOR ITEMS SUCH AS A WATER PUMP FALL OF 2000, BRAKE WORK SUMMER OF 200, FUEL PUMP JANUARY OF 1999.   NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON OR DID ANY GAUGES REFLECT ANY PROBLEMS.   IT DISTRESSES ME GREATLY THAT I MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THIS FIRE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC CAUSING MYSELF AND MY PASSENGER GREAT HARM OR EVEN DEATH.  I REVIEWED NHTSA'S COMPLAINT SECTION AND DID FIND A FEW OTHER FIRE RELATED PROBLEMS.  I HOPE ONE MORE WILL GET SOME ACTION TAKEN TO SEE WHAT CAUSE THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.  THANK YOU.  *AK",
