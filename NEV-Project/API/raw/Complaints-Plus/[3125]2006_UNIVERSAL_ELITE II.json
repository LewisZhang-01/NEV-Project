ON TRIP FROM SAN DIEGO, CA TO ST ANTHONY, ID AND RETURN I HAD TO REPLACE 3 OF THEM DUE TO BELT BREAKAGE AND TREAD SEPARATION.  ONLY THE FIRST ONE LEAKED AIR AND MY DORAN TPMS ALERTED ME TO THE LOSS OF PRESSURE.  AFTER STOPPING AND INSPECTING TIRE FOUND TREAD SEPARATION ON IT AND BROKEN BELT ON ANOTHER (TREAD WAS ROUNDED VS FLAT).  I REPLACED THE 2 TIRES WITH GOODYEAR MARATHON RADIAL TIRES AND CONTINUED ON TRIP.  LATER DURING A FUEL STOP I INSPECTED THE TIRES AND FOUND ANOTHER 1 HAD BROKEN THE BELT AND THROWN SOME TREAD, BUT HAD NOT STARTED TO LEAK.  I REPLACED THE REMAINING 2 TIRES GOODYEAR MARATHON RADIAL TIRES AND COMPLETED ROUND TRIP WITH NO FURTHER TROUBLE. *TR",
