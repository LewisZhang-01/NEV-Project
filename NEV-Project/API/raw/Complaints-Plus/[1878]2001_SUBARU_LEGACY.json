After the contact test drove the vehicle and experienced the failure himself, he took the vehicle to an independent mechanic and discovered that the rear control arm had rotted out due to severe corrosion. Upon investigation, the contact discovered that the vehicle had been placed under NHTSA Campaign Number: 03V153000 (Suspension). The manufacturer was then notified of the failure and confirmed the prior recall on the vehicle; however, they could not offer any further assistance. The contact also took the vehicle to the dealer where they informed him that the entire subframe had rotted out due to corrosion. The vehicle was not repaired and remained in their possession.

THE CAR WAS FINE FOR NEXT 5 DAYS (WEATHER WAS 10 TO 30 DEGREES).  ON DAY 6, WEATHER DROPPED TO ABOUT 8 DEGREES AND GAS SMELL RETURNED.  CAR WAS LEFT IN GARAGE AFTER DRIVING AND GARAGE FILLED WITH VERY STRONG GAS SMELL.  THERE IS AN OBVIOUS CORRELATION BETWEEN EXTREME COLD (10 DEGREES OR LESS) AND THIS PROBLEM.  WILL RETURN CAR TO DEALER FOR SECOND ATTEMPT AT REPAIR BUT SINCE WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO BE OVER 10 DEGREES FOR NEXT 2 WEEKS AM NOT SURE WILL BE ABLE TO REPLICATE PROBLEM. SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE PROBLEM IS A GAS LEAK AT COLD TEMPERATURES, WHICH MAY WELL BE A SAFETY HAZARD AND FIRE/EXPLOSION DANGER.   *CB",
