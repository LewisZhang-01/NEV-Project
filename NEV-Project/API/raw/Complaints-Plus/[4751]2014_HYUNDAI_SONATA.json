This is a major safety issue for me as other drivers believe I'm flashing my lights intentionally, not to mention, driving at night and having your headlights turn off randomly isn't very safe. We feel very unsafe driving this vehicle after dark because of this issue. This problem started at approx. 70,000 miles. Took the vehicle to the dealer and was told the issue is a defective multi function switch and that others are having the same issue. However,  but the dealer said this issue is only covered by the warranty up to 50K miles and I would have to pay to have this resolved. I contacted Hyundai Consumer Affair's and opened a complaint with them. I was assigned case number 18855023, but was told there isn't anything Hyundai could do and I would need to deal with my dealer to get this repaired out of warranty. From my research I've found that many other Sonata owners are experiencing this same issue and that some of the Hyundai Genesis line of vehicles also are experiencing these issues, but in response to these Genesis owners, Hyundai has extended the warranty of the multifunction switch assembly to 15 years with unlimited miles from the date of original retail delivery or date of first use (whichever occurs first). Why is Hyundai not addressing this same issue that exists on their other model lines???  Hyundai needs to extend the warranty and repair this defective switch for ALL other Hyundai models. This is a very unsafe and potentially life threatening hazardous issue that needs to be address for all Hyundai customers and not just the Genesis owners.",

I started panicking stepping on the gas pedal to speed up because of the traffic but I was unable to. But i managed to pull over to the shoulder then I turned off the car, waited a few minutes, then started the car back up. I proceeded off the exit managing only 35mph max speed. I had someone check my car And they found out I was low by 2 qts of oil. But prior to this I had just had my oil changed 1 month before. The car has 116100 mi on the odometer. The next day I contacted my local Hyundai dealership and was told I will need to have the car towed to them at that location. I was also told the time frame for someone to look at my car and repair would be 90 days turn around time. They advised me to contact other surrounding Hyundai dealerships. I contacted the another dealership and was told that I needed an appointment and I was scheduled to bring my car in a week later. My car has been at the dealership since 10/5/21. On oct 8th I was told they needed to perform a complete engine diagnostic, and a bearing clearance test to determine if the bearings have failed which results in internal engine failure. Which turned out to be a P1326 code. They also informed me that the engine would need to be replaced but would need it authorized by corporate. This is the message I received from Hyundai personnel: \"We will submit a request to Hyundai on how to proceed. They will need to submit the requested maintenance records. Next time hearing from Hyundai personnel was on November 11th I was informed that records show that the status of my car is still \"pending\".

The contact stated that while his son was driving 30 MPH, the check engine warning light illuminated the instrument panel with an abnormal clicking sound coming from the engine. The contact towed the vehicle to an independent mechanic who informed him that the vehicle was no longer safe to be driven. The contact then called a dealer and had the vehicle towed to the dealer for a diagnostic test. The contact was informed that the engine had failed and that the dealer needed approval from the manufacturer to replace the engine. The contact was called back and informed that they would not be able to service the vehicle because the vehicle had a salvage title. The contact then called the manufacturer directly and was given the same information. The vehicle had yet to be repaired and remained in the possession of the dealer. The failure mileage was approximately 79,000. From contact: Hyundai National has been extremely uncooperative. It was explained to them that the vehicle was about to prove fatal to his son, but none of the executives (to which the contact reached via email) replied via email. The case manager was rude and said she is the ultimate authority to make any decision and she has made a decision that Hyundai will not cover the repair of the vehicle. It should be noted that the salvage title of the vehicle had nothing to do with the engine. It was hit at the rear right due to which the vehicle was salvaged. Similar problems have happened with many many Hyundai vehicles. Do not know why it is not a national recall.",

After driving for a few years, about a month and half ago, while driving the engine just stalled on me. After having back and forth with Hyundai National Team and Hyundai Corporate, they denied my warranty claim that because its a salvaged title. The engine is original and was not tempered with as confirmed my Local Hyundai Dealer. Hyundai has currently recalled about 1.6 Million vehicles due  to premature bearing wear and potential engine failure issue. The vehicle currently has 65,000 miles on it, and the engine breakdown is an internal failure. Having a salvage title should not be a reason to deny the claim especially when its not a cosmetic problem but an engine failure itself. Spending $6,000 - $8,000 on a new engine is completely unaffordable for me. I will appreciate any help you can provide after I have been suffering without car for almost 2 months in these difficult COVID times.",

I was told that the engine is covered by a lifetime warranty and they didn't charge me anything. They performed recall #162 for the engine problem & installed a special software to monitor the knocking problem. They didn't open the engine to check the crank or the bearing wear. They asked me to keep an eye on the engine and if any thing happens, I could return back immediately to them. Only after 6 days, smoke started to go out of the exhaust and I couldn't drive the vehicle over 40 MPH. I drove the vehicle to them and left it for a week. After a week; when I called them, they told me that the engine needs to be changed with a new one but they couldn't contact Hyundai USA to send them a new engine because the car was driven more than 120K miles as per Hyundai rule (10 years/120K miles). I told the service center manager that it's a lifetime warranty according to the Hyundai Motor America and Kia Motors America Resolve Engine Litigation [https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2883] He said that Hyundai should approve it to replace the engine and I should contact them for approval. So I contacted NHTSA to get me that approval instead of wasting my time explaining the litigation. I couldn't drive the vehicle since then because of the heavy smoke. I towed it from the Service Center to my home and submitted the complaint. I consulted 2 mechanics who advised me not to drive the vehicle to avoid engine explosion or an accident. It's not safe to drive the vehicle for me and for others in the street. The litigation is very clear that engine warranty is lifetime and the problem that happened to it is what that warranty covers. Smoke and low speed driving mode are some of many symptoms of that issue. I am waiving my right of compensation for towing or rentals and I don't want any compensation other than engine swap ASAP. I want them to tow it back. Thanks",

Moreover, it's a known problem in many models of my vehicle. This light is a part of the safety inspection in my state VA which means it's important to have it working all the time. If the vehicle driver behind me doesn't notice that I'm in a stopping process or pressing on the brake paddle, both of us will be at risk especially on the high way. Yes the problem was confirmed by Hyundai and many service centers confirmed it. There was also a recall regarding this problem but didn't solve it permanently. It happened again and service centers don't fix those affected vehicles again. Since there was a recall before, this component was inspected and confirmed by the manufacturer. They should keep fixing it till they find a permanent solution or change the part with a better one like LED for example to reduce heat. There was no warning lamp, message, or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure. It's discovered when someone behind the affected vehicle warns me or the traffic police stops me. This is the most important brake light because at night it's the only light that warns other vehicles drivers behind me that's I'm reducing the speed or in a stop status since other right and left stop lights are shared with normal tailgate lights and might not warn others. This 3rd brake light is high enough to be seen by all vehicles behind my vehicle.",

THE CAR WON'T START WITH THE SAME ERROR MESSAGE. I RAN INTO THE DEALER ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION. THE WORSE THING IS THE DEALER NEVER RAN THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR CODE OR ANYTHING AND ASSUMED IT'S FIXED. I DEMANDED A REFUND. I MADE A FEW CALLS TO CHECK THE STATUS OF SERVICE SINCE THEN.

BOTTOM LINE IS I HAD BRAKES PUT ON IN MAY 2020 ON MY 2014 HYUNDAI, THEY DIDN'T FEEL RIT., TOOK CAR BACK, TEST RIDE, SEEMED OK.  THESE BRAKES WERE MANUFACTURED BY WAGNER BRAKES.; .FOR A FEW WEEKS WHEN I PRESSED ON BRAKES THERE WAS A SQUEAL, WHILE CAR WAS MOVING, AND LATELY SOUNDED LIKE STEEL ON STEEL. WHILE CARE WAS MOVING TOOK CAR BACK TO JTIRES PLUS, BRAKES WERE DEFECTIVE, THEY REPLACED THEM WITH DURALAST GOLD BRAKES.  I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS AGAINST WAGNER BRAKES, AND I'D LIKE A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THESE BRAKES. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE RECALL ON MY 2014 SONATA POWER TRAIN/GEAR SHIFT; CAMPAIGN # 123. THIS WAS COMPLETED IN 2017; HOWEVER, SOME MONTHS AGO ONCE THE GEAR SHIFT WAS IN PART  WITH MOTOR OFF, AND I TURNED ON THE MOTOR THE SHIFT WOULD NOT MOVE FROM THE PARK POSITION.  I HAD TO WORK WITH IT A WHILE; SOMETIMES AFTER A WHILE I WOULD PUT THE KEY. NEXT TO THE SHIFT COMPARTMENT AND I COULD SHIFT THE GEAR. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SHIFT GEAR AND HOW TO HAVE A SECOND RECALL ON CAMPAIGN 123. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES WHEN I PUT ON THE E BRAKE, IT SEEMS LIKE THE CAR WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  THE OTHER DAY AFTER BEING PARKED, I TURNED ON THE ENGINE, PUT THE GEAR IN REVERSE, BUT IT CONTINUED TO GO FORWARD.  I HAD TO TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART IT AND THEN PUT IT IN REVERSE BEFORE IT REVERSED. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU'VE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS LIKE THIS AND I AM REQUESTING THAT MY CAR BE TESTED FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS FREE OF CHARGE DUE TO ALL OF THE RECALLS HYUNDAI HAS HAD IN THE PAST.  IN ALL OF THE SITUATIONS ABOVE THE CAR WAS ON CITY STREETS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE REVERSING, I WAS PARKED IN A FAST FOOD PARKING LOT. *JS",

THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON OR ANY CODES STORED WHEN CHECKED.  I'VE CONTACTED HYUNDAI SERVICE CENTER MULTIPLE TIMES.

SINCE THEN THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 MORE TIMES. CAR IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP.   I STARTED RESEARCHING ON MY OWN, AND I READ THAT THE KNOCK SENSOR WAS AN UPDATE HYUNDAI ADDED AFTER THE RECALL OF THE ENGINES IN THESE CARS. THIS KNOCK SENSOR IS ACTUALLY PROTECTING MY CAR (AND ME) BY PUTTING IT IN 'LIMP MODE' BECAUSE IT SENSES SOMETHING DANGEROUS IN THE ENGINE. I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO INFORM THEM I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE THIS HAS HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES AND CLEARLY IS'T FIXED, AND I'M SURE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE RECALLS THEY HAVE AND ENGINE FIRES. THEY'VE DONE NOTHING.    LAST TIME I WENT TO GET THE CAR THE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE HAVING ISSUES, BUT HYUNDAI DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE TO DO WORK-AROUND FIXES INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL REPAIRS NEEDED. THE MANGER SAID HE PREDICTS THAT \"THERE WILL BE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BECAUSE OF HYUNDAI NOT DOING ANYTHING TO ACTUALLY FIX THIS ENGINE ISSUE\".  I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TURN TO, BUT I' AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR.  I DON'T WANT TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE ENGINE CATCH FIRE.  I'M CURRENTLY PREGNANT AND IT HAS BEEN VERY STRESSFUL DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE.  I FEAR THE DEALERSHIP WILL DISABLE THE KNOCK SENSOR SO THAT IT STOPS PUTTING THE ENGINE ON LIMP MODE AND THEN I WILL HAVE A FIRE. I ALSO FEAR THAT THE KNOCK SENSOR MAY NOT WORK CORRECTLY NEXT TIME AND THE ENGINE MAY CATCH FIRE. I NEED THE ENGINE FIXED.

TRIED TO RESTART BUT NOTHING.  HAD TO MOVE CAR SO TRIED TO START AGAIN - STARTER DID NOT CRANK AT ALL, BUT SUDDENLY ENGINE WAS RUNNING AS IF IT HAD NEVER STOPPED AND ALL POWER WAS RESTORED.  DROVE IMMEDIATELY TO DEALER THINKING IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH ENGINE RECALL.  WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY WITH NO INCIDENT.  AFTER 3 DAYS OF BEING AT DEALER WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMETHING IN THE BRAKE FLUID \"MODULE\" HAD BROKEN LOSE AND BRAKE FLUID LEAKED INTO WIRE HARNESS CAUSING EXTREME CORROSION.  THEY BELIEVE THE ENGINE NEVER ACTUALLY STOPPED RUNNING, BUT RATHER THE ELECTRICAL SIGNAL WAS MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED DUE TO THE CORROSION. IT WAS GOING TO BE A $5000 FIX.  WE DID NOT HAVE CAR REPAIRED. DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WOULD SEND IT TO AUCTION. THIS CAR MUST TO BE PULLED OFF THE ROAD AS IT IS A HAZARD TO ANYONE WHO PURCHASES IT, EVEN \"AS IS\".  REPORTED TO CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT HYUNDAI ON 11/6/19. SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE 11/14/19  AND WAS TOLD CAR WOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.  I AM REPORTING HERE TO INSURE THAT IT IS INDEED TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.  WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED.  WIFE DRIVES ABOUT 35 MILES PER DAY AND IT COULD HAVE EASILY HAPPENED WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING TO WORK.",

I WAS PROVIDED WITH A RENTAL CAR, WHICH I CAN USE UNTIL MY CAR IS FIXED, BUT HYUNDAI WILL NEED TO SEND THEM A NEW ENGINE SO THEY DONT KNOW YET WHEN THE CAR WILL BE FIXED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE HOSES, GASKETS; ANYTHING THAT WASN'T EITHER A BLACK SURFACE OR METAL BECAUSE THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THOSE. THE ESTIMATE FOR ME TO PAY WOULD BE AROUND $300.   ALSO, DURING THE INSPECTION FOR THE ENGINE, I WAS TOLD THE AXELS WERE LEAKING AND THOSE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED INCLUDING ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE $50 DEDUCTIBLE AND THE WARRANTY WOULD COVER THE REST.   WHEN THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE IT WAS STILL MOVING WAS VERY UNSAFE, ESPECIALLY DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.",

FOR THE REST OF THE 25 MILES TO GET TO WORK ON A BUSY HIGHWAY I STOPPED USING MY TURN SIGNAL FOR FEAR THAT MY HEADLIGHTS WOULD NOT COME BACK ON. I TOOK BY CAR TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ISSUE FIXED. I WAS CALLED WHILE MY CAR WAS STILL AT THE DEALER THAT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE AND THAT THEY REPLACED SOME PART THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE OIL. OF COURSE WITH THE ENGINE ONLY BEING 2 YEARS OLD I HAD TO PAY. I PAID $458 AND WHEN I LEFT THE DEALER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS OFF. I LET MY NEPHEW BORROW MY CAR FOR A WEEK AND WHEN I PICKED IT UP THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS BACK ON AND WAS STILL HAVING THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE WHEN SIGNALING. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUES LOOKED AT AGAIN. A WEEK GOES BY AND I HEAR NOTHING BUT I DO GET AN AUTOMATED VOICEMAIL FROM THE DEALER REGARDING A GREAT INCENTIVE TO TRADE IN MY CAR FOR A NEWER MODEL. NO THANKS!! I'M DONE WITH HYUNDAI. I CALL THE DEALER TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF MY CAR TWICE AND GET NO ANSWER. I DRIVE TO THE DEALER TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE. ONCE AGAIN I AM TOLD THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE AND DIAGNOSTIC SHOWS NO ISSUES BUT IT COULD BE THE TURN SIGNAL SWITCH. THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON BECAUSE THE CAM SHIFT SENSOR WENT BAD. NOW I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS WAS NOT FOUND THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT THE CAR IN. SO NOW I'M TOLD THE SHOP FOREMAN WAS OUT ALL WEEK AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR HIM TO LOOK AT MY CAR TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGURE OUT THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE.
