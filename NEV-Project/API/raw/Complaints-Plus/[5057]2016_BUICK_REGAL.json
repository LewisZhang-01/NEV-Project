It was in and out of the dealer with them trying to figure out the exact problem.  They could not, so they contacted GM for approval for an engine replacement.  We were concerned about going this route but were assured it would be taken care of for the life of the car.  After the replacement in July 2016, the car seemed to be better but other weird issues arose.  The engine always made a squealing noise that we were told was fine.  We have done all required maintenance, recalls, and regular service.  For the past 2 months, the car has had strange shifting issues.  It was taken in to be looked at and nothing was found.  The transmission received its' routine maintenance on schedule.  It still was a problem and we were told to drive it until a code appeared.  The car got progressively worse and had great difficulty shifting, which had us involved in a few close calls.  Took it to a different dealer that also didn't find a problem. They said since there was no code, but seemed transmission related, they would drain it and replace the fluid.  This also didn't work.  We continued to drive the car and almost ended up stranded in the middle of the night while driving the freeway.  The car became almost uncontrollable.  We made it home.  But, the following day while driving it to work, the car was jerking, stalled, and then lost the capability of reverse and neutral.  We had to have it towed and a new transmission put in.  We were told by the dealer that there was an explosion in the transmission, and we were lucky we were somewhere safe when the car died.  It's very frustrating paying for a vehicle that didn't seem right from the beginning.  We have put well over $6,500 in trying to repair a car that seems like it was never right in the first place.  We have been fortunate that neither of us, or any of our children, have been hurt considering the major issues with our car.",

The problem was scary enough that I brought the car to a neighborhood dealership to see if there was any safety recall for that issue. There was none. The replaced a sensor or something to fix the problem. It has not happened again until two weeks ago. Exactly the same thing happened, skid briefly on a perfect road surface in a perfect weather condition, skid light and the engine light came on, but disappeared after a minute. I brought back the car to the dealership and asked them find the original record for fixing the problem. But, they insisted it was not the same issue, this time it was my old tires that caused the problem. I got all my tires and brakes replaced, but still experienced the same problem. Given severity of the safety hazard, now I am afraid to drive the car. I could easily been in an accident if there were more cars around during either of the skidding incidents.
