WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT THE IDLE GETS ROUGH AND IF THIS WAS THE 1960'S I WOULD SAY IT HAD A BAD SPARK PLUG OR CARBURETOR ISSUES; HOWEVER, THIS IS 2018 SO NOT SURE BUT IT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN RELATE THE IDLE ISSUE WITH.. I SPOKE WITH THE SALESPERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT SOLD ME THE CAR BUT HE SAID HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT INNER WORKINGS OF CARS SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR 4/25/2018 SINCE I CANNOT GET THERE AT THE TIMES THEY WANT ME TO; AND UNTIL THEN I CAN ONLY MONITOR IT.. THIS ISSUE STARTED AFTER I HAD THE CAR APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK; NOTHING LIKE FLORIDA CAR DEALERS SELECTING A CAR FOR ME OFF THEIR LOT THAT HAS ISSUES..",

WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS THAT THE GAS PEDAL STICKS A LITTLE & DOESN'T RESPOND RIGHT AWAY TO FOOT PRESSURE, BUT I'M A SMALL PERSON SO FOOT PRESSURE IS NOT AS HEAVY AS BIG PERSON..
