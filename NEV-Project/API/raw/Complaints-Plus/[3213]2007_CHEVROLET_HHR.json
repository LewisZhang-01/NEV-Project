I replaced the fuse and the vehicle was fine for about 4 weeks, but once again driving 30-35 mph, the light came on the dashboard.  I have saved both replaced fuses, I\u2019m wondering after reading other reports whether the fuses are even blown?

Upon looking at the car a very noticeable puddle of gas was on the ground. I had the car moved to my home and it is currently unable to use due to the gas leak. This is ridiculous. Everything I have read points to Chevy cheaping out and not using non-corroding metal lines or nylon and the proximity of the heat shield which traps the moisture and corrodes the fuel lines. This REALLY needs to be recalled at Chevy's expense as it is a manufacturer's error. I have no idea if a prior situation had been addressed by the previous owner (commercial computer repair shop).",

I CONTACTED \"GM\" VIA THEIR 'SOCIAL MEDIA CUSTOMER CARE CENTER', THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED THE ISSUE, AND WAS DIRECTED TO A LOCAL BUICK/GMC DEALERSHIP FOR AN EVALUATION, WITHIN HOURS I HEARD A NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.

THE EXAMINER TOLD ME HE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY OTHER RUST ISSUES ON OR UNDER THIS VEHICLE. KEEP IN MIND THAT I AM NOT AN 'AUTOMOTIVE' ENGINEER; BUT- TO MY 'UNTRAINED EYE' PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PART IS DEEPLY HIDDEN WITHIN THE REAR BUMPER COVER; AND THE DESIGN OF THE REAR BUMPER COVER IS SUCH THAT IT FOSTERS THE COLLECTION OF DEBRIS FROM THE ROAD ON IT'S HORIZONTAL SURFACES. THIS DEBRIS THEN IS IN SITU WITH THE METAL PARTS OF THE ACTUAL 'REAR BUMPER'. GIVEN TIME THE DEBRIS RETAINS MOISTURE WHICH 'APPARENTLY' THEN COVERS THE METAL PARTS. ...AND ONE GETS THE RESULTS SHOWN IN THE PHOTOS.

THE CHIME SOUND WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ERROR MESSAGE AND I BECAME VERY AFRAID AND THE CAR WAS VERY HARD TO STEER.

I BARELY MISSED RUNNING UP AND OVER THE BOULEVARD BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE STREET (CUBA BLVD) IN THE RIVER OAKS SUBDIVISION IN MONROE, LA.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY DEALER (RYAN CHEVROLET IN MONROE, LA ) ON 03/28/2013 TO BE EXAMINED. THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE 2006 MODELS FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT NOT ON THE 2007 MODELS. THEY PROVIDED AN ESTIMATE OF 1400.00 TO REPLACE THE ELECTRIC STEERING MOTOR AND THE STEERING COLUMN TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THEY CHARGED ME 133.10 FOR THIS INSPECTION. I DID NOT HAVE THE FIX MADE AS I CANNOT AFFORD IT DUE TO MY LOW INCOME. THE POWER STEERING CONTINUES TO FAIL SEVERAL TIMES PER WEEK AS OF THIS WRITING. I AM WRITING BECAUSE I JUST NOTICED IN THE NEWS THAT NHTSA HAS ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM ON THE 2009 AND 2010 MODELS BUT NOT ON THE 2007 MODEL THAT I OWN .SEEMS STRANGE THAT 2006. 2009 AND 2010 MODELS ARE RECALLED BUT NOT THE 2007 ( 2008). WHEN I  TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT FIX THE 2007 BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN RECALLED. I COULD GET THE NAME OF THAT PERSON IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANKS FOR READING AND PRAY FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHERS TOO.  NOTE: I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW IN JANUARY 2007 FROM BUNKER CHEVROLET IN MARION, IN WHERE I LIVED PREVIOUSLY.  *TR",

IT HAS HAPPENED THREE MORE TIMES SINCE THEN, AND I CONTINUE TO DRIVE UNTIL I GET TO A RED TRAFFIC SIGNAL, TURN THE CAR OFF, AND RESTART IT. LUCKILY, (SO FAR), IT HAS RESET ITSELF AND THE POWER STEERING WORKS AGAIN. I AM CONCERNED AS TO WHY THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL ON THIS, AS THERE ARE TONS OF ISSUES ON THIS MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR. I HAVE A 1 1/2 YR. OLD SON AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS HOW FORTUNATE I HAVE BEEN THAT EACH TIME THIS HAS OCCURRED, HE HASN'T BEEN IN THE VEHICLE WITH ME. COME ON, CHEVROLET, PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE! WE ALSO OWN A CHEVY TRAILBLAZER AND LOVE OUR CHEVY PRODUCTS, BUT I AM CONCERNED NOW AS TO WHETHER I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN IT'S TIME.",

TODAY, I WENT TO TOWN WITH MY HUSBAND AND THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN. NOW I COULD NOT EXIT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THIS IS CRAZY. SAME THING ON THE PASSENGER DOOR. WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE AND I HAD TO CRAWL OVER TO GET OUT. THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE. ALSO, IF WE WERE TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENT OR EMERGENCY WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT. WHAT IF A CHILD WERE IN THAT SEAT. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE ANYONE WITH THIS ISSUE  BUT AFTER LOOKING ON THE INTERNET IT IS A VERY BIG ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED TO FIX IT BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY HURT BY NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO GET OUT IN ANY SITUATION. THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN FROM INSIDE HANDLE OR OUTSIDE HANDLE SO YOU ARE STUCK INSIDE OR LOCKED OUTSIDE. *TR",
