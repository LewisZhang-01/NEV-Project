I believe this was a effort to address the issue while avoiding financial loss for Chevrolet.  This is dangerous and I'm not going to put another pump on the vehicle, it won't fix the problem because it's a design issue.  GM can either fix the truck or give me a truck that will stop.  This truck has been a nightmare, I could go on about loss of power steering and complete loss of electrical power (apparently these are known recall issues for the same truck design, but my specific truck doesn't fall under that recall), but for now I'd simply like the company to be held accountable for the brake issue.

Only happens at these lower speeds such as while trying to park or stop at a traffic light. We have had the brake pads, rotors, calipers, etc checked..everything looks good so this is not the problem. There were no warning lamps or messages associated with this problem..it has happened the last 2 times we have driven the vehicle..we are not driving it anymore at the moment until we figure out was is going on. Afraid we will hit something or someone else if we cannot get the vehicle stopped in time. Looking online seems there were several recalls for this problem for this vehicle but I never received a notice for it..possibly a bad vacuum pump or ABS defect? Needs to be reset or something..Please advise.  Thank you.",

A manufacturing issue of placing the negative battery cable in the wrong spot, causes the dash, power steering, stability tracking and air conditioning to shut off completely. When braking, the dash shuts off and the steering wheel locks, which has sent me into oncoming traffic.  My brother had the exact same year make and model of truck and had the same exact issue. When his needed to be fixed, he was told the same thing from the dealership. \u201cThe negative battery cable should have never been in placed in that position, but relocating it will fix the problem. Only, after replacing the battery it burned out as well.   Here is the text I received from the dealership today. \u201cHey Brian, this is Matt @ Ken Garff Chevrolet, we have tracked the problem down on the truck to the negative battery cable. It has high resistance causing the electrical issues. Estimate for repairs $492 before tax. Reply STOP to OptOut.\u201d It\u2019s a very good thing they diagnosed the issue, since I told them what it was when I walked in their shop. I told them verbatim what they sent back to me.   There are literally thousands of complaints online with the same issue. How does a manufacturing fault, that is most definitely a safety issue, become the consumers expense. This problem is much worse, and more dangerous than the recalls that are currently on the vehicle.   How many accidents and how much consumer money needs to be spent, before a recall is placed on such a common manufacturing issue.

I truly believe that the issues have caused, or are caused by this prevailing issue of a wobbling drive shaft. Every time I have had it in for repairs the issue still persists and I can't always get the time to go back and have it looked at it again. It is a safety issue above all else and I truly believe GM knows about it but does nothing.

OK  NO HEAT DAMAGE FOUND.\" AGAIN, MY PROBLEM OCCURRED *AFTER* MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP ALLEGEDLY ADDRESSED THIS KNOWN PROBLEM AND ALREADY-ISSUED RECALL. I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT THE REPAIRS/INSPECTION THEY CLAIMED THEY DID ACTUALLY HAPPENED. IF THEY DID, CLEARLY THEY DID NOT REMEDY THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. I AM NOW TRYING TO GET INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO REPLACE THE REAR WINDOW. AT MINIMUM, THEY'VE SAID IT COULD TAKE TWO DAYS TO GET THE REPLACEMENT WINDOW.",

I ASKED THE DEALER IF THEY NTESTED IT UNDER A HARD ACCELERATION; THEY DID NOT.  THEY REPLACED THE #6 PISTON AND THE VALVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE #6 PISTON.  ALL WORK PERFORMED WAS DONE ON #6, EVEN THE INITIAL COLLAPSED LIFTER.  I PICKED IT UP AGAIN AND AGAIN A HARD ACCELERATION PRODUCED MISFIRES!  I HAD IT TOWED IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD TESTED IT WITH HARD ACCELERATION.  THE RESPONSE WAS @ 3300 RPM.  I TOLD THE SERVICE WRITER THAT, IF YOU DO NOT TEST IT UNDER HARD ACCELERATION YOU WILL NOT EVEN HAVE IT MISFIRE!  HE REDID THE TEST AND VOILA, HE CAN SEE IT NOW!  TECHNICAL RESOURCES TOLD THEM TO REPLACE VLOM, OR \"VALVE LIFTER OIL MANIFOLD\".  I GOT IT BACK AND IT DOES WORK, MORE OR LESS.  A HARD ACCELERATION WILL PRODUCE UNEVEN ACCELERATION BUT WITHOUT THE PREVIOUS ISSUES.  I AM WORKING FOR NOW.  I CONDUCTED SOME FURTHER RESEARCH WHICH I AM PROBE TO DO AND FOUND AN ACDELCO YOUTUBE VIDEO: HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=MKLY7XMMSOS&FEATURE=YOUTU.BE&FBCLID=IWAR2ZVZPVJ6Z6E3SELJZGVXZERU8PTLLKGPKQTFXMRSNS7OQENCOLHRRGI_I.  THIS VIDEO STATES THAT IF YOU HAVE AN AFM LEVENT THAT INVOLVES A COLLAPSED LIFTER YOU MUST REPLACE A PLETHORA OF PARTS.  THAT WAS NOT DONE.

WE WERE TRAVELING IN THE TRAVEL LANE WHEN A PICKUP PULLED ALONGSIDE HONKING HIS HORN, THE DRIVER WAS POINTING AT THE CAMPER. I PULLED OVER AND DISCOVERED THE CABLE HOLDING UP MY SPARE TIRE BROKE, THE SPARE DROPPED TO THE PAVEMENT BOUNCING UNDER THE CAMPER. I DID A QUICK REPAIR GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN A MOTEL.  THE NEXT MORNING I SPENT 2 HOURS REPAIRING THE CAMPER ENOUGH TO GET IT TO OUR RESIDENCE IN MAINE. DAMAGE REPAIR BILL TO THE RV WAS $9100.00. I BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO QUIRK CHEVROLET BANGOR ME WHERE I PURCHASED IT NEW AND THEIR MECHANICS INSPECTED THE TIRE HOIST.  THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY THE CABLE FRAYED AND BROKE. THE SPARE WAS INSPECTED BEFORE OUR TRIP SOUTH IN FEB.AND WAS SECURELY IN PLACE WITH NO MOVEMENT. THE CABLE WAS IN NEW CONDITION WITH NO RUST. I DEALT WITH GM CUSTOMER SERVICE GAVE THEM ACCIDENT REPORTS AND ALL INFO NEEDED. MAY 5TH GM SENDS OUT ESIS FIELD INSPECTOR RON YEAGER. MR. YEAGER STATES HE HAS NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE ON SUCH A NEW VEHICLE. APPROXIMATELY A MONTH LATER I'M IN CONTACT WITH GM THEY DENY THE CLAIM FOR REPAIRS BUT HAVE NO EXPLANATION AS TO THE CAUSE.  THIS SPARE TIRE SYSTEM ON GM TRUCKS HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN FOR ITS FAILURES.  USUALLY THE CABLES RUST IN PLACE AND YOU CAN'T GET THE TIRE DOWN WHEN NEEDED. I'VE ALWAYS OWNED GM TRUCKS AND USUALLY PLACE THE SPARE IN THE TRUCK BED DUE TO THIS POOR SYSTEM.

APRIL 2019, I RECEIVE A LETTER FROM GM, DESCRIBING THIS ISSUE AND SAYING IF I HAVE LESS THAN 72,000 MILES OR BOUGHT IT NEW WITHIN THE LAST 6 YEARS,WHICHEVER COME FIRST, THEY WILL FIX IT.  BRAKES ARE A VERY SERIOUS COMPONENT. THIS PROBLEM DATES BACK TO THE 2014,S. I FEEL GM SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR MY REPAIR COST, SINCE THE PROBLEM CAME FROM THEIR PLANT. I HAVE MORE MILES ON MY TRUCK THAN THEY SAY THEY WILL COVER. BRAKES AND THE COMPONENTS ARE THINGS THEY SHOULD COVER. I HAVE INVOICES AND PROOF THAT I PAID THESE EXPENSES. EVERY PERSON PAYS HARD EARNED MONEY FOR A NEW VEHICLE. MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BACK THEIR VEHICLES. I WAS DRIVING ON A SIDE STREET WHEN THIS PUMP WENT OUT.

I PULLED OUT OF RAMP AND PROBLEM REPEATED WHEN BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE WAS APPLIED AND REMOVED AND THEN REAPPLIED.

CHEVROLET IS AWARE OF ISSUE AS TECH HEARD MY DESCRIPTION AND HE STATED THERE WAS A BULLETIN FROM GM ON IT BUT IT WAS NOT RECALLED.  AFTER RECEIVING ESTIMATE LATER THAT DAY FROM CHEVROLET I DECIDED TO TAKE TRUCK TO ANOTHER REPAIR FACILITY THAT ESTIMATED REPAIR $500 CHEAPER THAN CHEVROLET DEALER. REPAIRS WERE MADE FOLLOWING THE GM BULLETIN AND USING GM PARTS FROM THE CHEVY DEALER FOR $1139 AS OPPOSED TO DYER CHEVROLET WANTING $1662 FOR A ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH INDICATES THAT MANY OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE AS WELL. IT IS MY HOPE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP AS I AM SURE THIS WILL OCCUR AGAIN AS GM HAS NOT CHANGED ANYTHING THEY HAVE MERELY CHARGED THE CUSTOMER TO PUT A BANDAID ON A PROBLEM THEY ENGINEERED.  THE MECHANIC THAT ULTIMATELY REPAIRED TRUCK STATED GM KNOWS THEY HAVE PROBLEM AS THEY ONLY USED THAT BOOSTER PUMP ON 2015. THERE IS NO WAY A 50000 MILE TRUCK SHOULD HAVE THIS ISSUE. PLEASE SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS FROM CHEVROLET DEALER THAT DESCRIBE ISSUE OF MECHANICAL FAILURE OF VACUUM PUMP. HOW IS IT NOT A RECALL ISSUE IF VACUUM PUMP MAY PUMP MOTOR OIL INTO BRAKE BOOSTER? THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AND IS NOT A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE. THIS IS A ENGINEERING FAILURE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING ANY WAY I CAN TO GET THIS RECALLED. CONTACT ME AS NEEDED.

THERE IS NO WARNING IN THE VEHICLE SENSING SYSTEM TO ADVISE THE OPERATOR TO HAVE THE BRAKES SERVICED FOR THIS ISSUE.  CHEVROLET ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB #PIT5361A & #PIT5361B) IN 2016.  OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  MINE BRAKES FAILED AFTER JUST PULLING IN MY DRIVEWAY FROM A 600 MILE TRIP.

IN JUNE 2016, THE DEALERSHIP STATED THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE TIRES WERE MOUNTED ON THE RIMS INCORRECTLY AND REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES AND BALANCED THEM; THE VIBRATION CONTINUED. AFTER TRYING TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP OVER THE SAME ISSUE, THEY WILL NO LONGER CALL ME BACK.  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT AT LEAST 8 TIMES WITHIN THE PAST MONTH TO NO AVAIL.  SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE INDICATED THE PROBLEM IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE DRIVE SHAFT B/C THE ENTIRE TRUCK VIBRATES WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  THEREFORE, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY TOLD ME I NEED TO ROTATE AND BALANCE THE TIRES.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE HISTORY OF THE TRUCK WITH THEM AND REQUESTED THE SERVICE DEPT. CHECK THE DRIVE SHAFT, THEY STATED THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT IS NOT THE DRIVE SHAFT (WHICH WAS NOT INSPECTED TO MY KNOWLEDGE) AND TOLD ME THE TIRES NEED TO BE FORCED BALANCED AND THEY COULD NOT HELP ME.  THIS DEALERSHIP REFERRED ME TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP FOR ASSISTANCE.  I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS ISSUE FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW AND CANNOT GET HELP.  FURTHER, NEITHER OF THE DEALERSHIPS HAVE MADE ME AWARE OF THE BULLETIN AND HAVE NOT TRIED ANYTHING PAST THE REPLACING & BALANCING THE TIRES.  THE VIBRATION IS SO BAD OTHER THINGS IN MY TRUCK ARE STARTING TO COME LOOSE AND VIBRATE.",

THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW IN MARCH OF 2016 AND HAD 5089 MILES  WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED.  HOW CAN GM DENY THIS CLAIM.  SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE LIFT KIT CAUSED THE DEPLOYMENT IF THAT IS THEIR REASON FOR DENIAL?   NO WHERE IN THE WARRANTY INFORMATION DOES IT STATE INSTALLING A LIFT KIT CAN CAUSE THE SIDE AIR BAGS TO DEPLOY.  NO WHERE ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FROM THE LIFT KIT MANUFACTURER DOES IT STATE YOUR WARRANTY COULD BE VOID IF YOU INSTALL THE KIT. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. ANY HELP YOU CAN PROVIDE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",

THIS DIDNOT FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE SEVERE VIBRATION GOING DOWN THE ROAD. I THEN TOOK THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER DEALER FOR THE VIBRATION, THEY TEST DROVE IT AND CONFIRMED THE VIBRATION, DID A ROAD FORCE BALANCE ON ALL 4 WHEELS, THEN REPLACED ALL TIRE'S, THIS ALSO HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM,THE TRUCK IS STILL VIBRATING, THE ENTIRE SEAT  JUST SHAKES, I AM PRESENTLY WAITING ON ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME HIMSELF AFTER REPLACING ALL 4 TIRE'S THAT IT FELT LIKE A BALANCE ISSUE INSIDE THE MOTOR WHICH THERE IS NO FIX, NOW THAT IS CRAZY...I FELL THAT THIS TRUCK SHOULD BE REPLACED OR MY MONEY BACK ENTIRELY.THE TRUCK ONLY HAS A LITTLE OVER 2000 MILES CAUSE IT MAKES ME SICK TO DRIVE IT....",
