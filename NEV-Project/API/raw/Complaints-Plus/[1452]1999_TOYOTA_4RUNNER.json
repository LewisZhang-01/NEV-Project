IT COULD HAVE TORN THE AXLE OUT FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE WITH NO PREVIOUS WARNING. I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON 4 LANE INTERSTATE AT 70 JUST DAYS BEFORE WITH NO HANDLING ISSUES AT ALL. I PERSONALLY HAVE CHANGED THE OIL AND GREASED THE DRIVE TRAIN ALL BUT ONCE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND NOT NOTICED THIS SMALL AREA OF SEVERE RUST THROUGH. I HAVE ALSO SPENT OVER $3000 ON EXHAUST, TIRES, AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR OVER THE PAST YEAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTHY OF 5-10 MORE YEARS AND 100,000 MORE MILES. MY 2001 CAMRY IS DRIVEN BY MY SON NOW AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 390,000 MILES ON IT. I JUST SOLD MY 1994 JEEP CHEROKEE WITH OVER 300,000 MILES ON IT AND THIS 4RUNNER BODY IS IN MUCH BETTER CONDITION THAN THOSE AND THAT WAS WHY I EXPECTED THIS WOULD TOO. THIS IS DEFINITELY A WEAK SPOT HARD TO DETECT BECAUSE MYSELF AND 3 OTHER MECHANIC PLACES HAD NOT SEEN IT WHEN SERVICING IT BUT YET IT IS ALSO A VERY CRITICAL FUNCTION THAT CAN CAUSE COMPLETE LOSS OF CONTROL WHEN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AXLE IS TORN LOOSE AND OUT FROM THE VEHICLE. HEAD-ON COLLISIONS, ROLLOVERS, ETC ARE VERY LIKELY. THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS WARNING MUST BE MADE KNOWN TO OTHER DRIVERS OF THESE 4RUNNERS AND A RECALL TO REPLACE THE FRAME AS NEEDED JUST LIKE TOYOTA HAS DONE FOR OTHER TRUCKS OF THEIRS, I.E. TUNDRA, SEQUOIA, TACOMA WITH FULL FRAME LIKE THIS.

I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE 4RUNNER AND COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. THE REASON I LOST CONTROL OF THE 4RUNNER IS BECAUSE OF A SERIOUS RUSTING ISSUE IN THE FRAME (THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED ON THE NHTSA, AND ALSO MANY OTHER WEBSITES). THE REASON THIS RUSTING ISSUE IS SO DANGEROUS IS WHERE THE RUSTING HAS OCCURRED. THE FRAME IS RUSTING RIGHT AT THE SECTION THAT THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BRACKET IS WELDED TO THE FRAME. THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BRACKET IS ATTACHED TO THE LINK/BAR THAT HOLDS THE REAR AXLE IN PLACE. THE RUST ON MY 4RUNNER FRAME CAUSED THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BRACKET ON THE DRIVERS SIDE TO COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE FRAME, CAUSING A LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE (SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS). I CHECK THE CONTROL ARM BRACKET ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, AND IT ALSO SHOWS THE SAME SEVERE RUSTING AT THE FRAME WHERE THE CONTROL ARM BRACKET IS ATTACHED.  THERE ARE STILL MANY 3RD GENERATION 4RUNNERS ON THE ROAD, AND I FEEL THIS RUSTING SITUATION IS PUTTING MANY LIVES IN DANGER. THERE IS NO WARNING, YOU JUST LOSE CONTROL.

I DID NOT HAVE A FLOOR MAT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE, I DID NOT HAVE MY FOOT ON THE GAS, AND WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING TO RACE THE ENGINE.      I COULD NOT MAKE THE ENGINE STOP RACING. I TRIED TO PUT MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL AND THEN RELEASED IT. IT WAS STILL RACING, AND THE GAS PEDAL WAS NOT DEPRESSED OR CAUGHT ON ANYTHING.  FORTUNATELY, THE CAR WAS STILL IN NEUTRAL WITH THE PARKING BRAKE ON. IT WAS VERY SCARY, AS I COULD NOT MAKE THE ENGINE STOP RACING.  I HAD TO TURN THE ENGINE OFF TO STOP IT.      I TOOK IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER, THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AFTER INSPECTING WITH A \"SCAN TOOL\" AND THE WIRING LOOKED GOOD. THEY SAID THAT IT WAS BECAUSE A PACK RAT HAD BEEN IN THE ENGINE AT THE TIME. (THAT'S A PRETTY LAME EXCUSE.)     THEY SAID THEY COULD \"CLEAN THE THROTTLE\" AND \"FLUSH THE FUEL LINE\" WHICH I HAD THEM DO (COST $300.) BECAUSE I WAS SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THEY DID SOMETHING. *TR",

SO I STOPED THE CAR AND  BENDED OVER THE RIGHT SIDE TO GET THEM OUT WITH MY RIGHT HAND, SINCE THEY WERE UNDER THE SEAT, I WAS NOT ABLE TO EVEN REACH THEM.  THEN I USED MY LEFT HAND, TRIED REACH THEM FROM UNDER THE SEAT. GUES WHAT HAPPENED?    SINCE MY RIGHT HAND STILL ON THE RIGHT SITE OF THE SEAT, IT ACCIDENTLY PUSHED THE SEAT MOVE FORWARD BUTTON, THE SEAT WAS MOVING FORWARD WHILE MY LEFT HAND STILL UNDER THE SEAT. BECAUSE THERE IS A MATEL OBJECT WAS UNDER, IT HURT MY LEFT HAND   BADLY, LUCKILY I REALIZED I WAS PUSHING THE BOTTON, I RELEASED IT ON TIME, SO THERE'S  NO SERIOUS INJURE.    HAD I NOT RELEASE MY RIGHT HAND ON TIME, I WOULD HAVE GOT A REAL SERIOUS INJURY.    SO PLEASE START SOME OF YOUR INVESTIGATION.
