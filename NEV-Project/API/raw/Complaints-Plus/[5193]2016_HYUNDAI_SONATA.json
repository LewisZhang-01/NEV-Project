They sent a brochure to their customers to get the software updated for knocking sensors and then placed a lifetime warranty for the issues caused by it including any repair costs. They said the software will detect the knocking noise and will turn on Warning lights (Engine Light) as well as place the vehicle into reduced power, engine protection mode. Their brochure said they have defective engines in 2011-2019 Sonatas, 2013-2018 Santa FE Sports, 2019 Senta Fes, and 2014,2015, 2018 and 2019 Tucsons.I own a 2016 Hyundai Sonata. I did software update and then I started having engine knocking at around 76,000 miles. Sometimes, car automatically loses power on highways/freeways and sometimes it starts to accelerate on its own at very high RPM\u2019s. I contacted Hyundai dealership in Spring, TX (North Freeway Hyundai), which told me that Hyundai doesn\u2019t cover it anymore until unless its complete engine failure. This is not what their Warranty document (Brochure) said. They are denying to take care of the issue which was caused by manufacturing defect and their software update. Their brochure said they will take care of it including any engine repair costs. Their dealership told me that this is just the \u201cBeginning of the engine falling apart\u201d, they can start with putting a new cover on the faulty engine part rather than replacing it, which will cost me $640.50+tax to take the engine light disappear for few days. If they have to fix it permanently, it is going to cost me \u201cThousands of Dollars\u201d into parts and labor charges. Private mechanic said Hyundai Engines are \"Can of Worms\" and wont even touch it. As per Hyundai case managers instructions, I ended up spending $435.50 out of pocket without any work done on my vehicle. As per their Brochure, they are making defected engines from 2011.

Clearly the issue was not fixed and they sent me to drive in a car that was faulty and not fixed, endangering my life and possibly others around me. It has only been inspected by hyundai, but clearly inspection by them is inadequate. No engine light warnings ever appeared. Oil light would occasionally flash on and off but I didn\u2019t think anything of it because, 1) no loud sounds/vibrations were happening, 2) my next oil change service wasn\u2019t until almost over 1,000 miles, as I regularly keep up with maintenance on my vehicle.

This vehicle was able to return to its residence, and it was towed to a Hyundai Dealership. Photos and videos were taken of this vehicle prior to being towed, and its battery voltage was tested. The Hyundai Dealership initially reported a dead battery, and that diagnostics were completed. Further conversations took place to question if a jump box or battery charger had been used, and the manager offered to test this vehicle personally. The manager stated that two jump boxes started this vehicle, and then stated he drove this vehicle with two jump boxes connected. The manager insisted that this vehicle's issues were only caused by a failed (dead) battery. A new battery was purchased and then the Hyundai Dealership installed it. The mileage reported by the Hyundai Dealership on its invoice was 1 mile, yet the Hyundai Service Department stated that multiple test drives took place after battery was installed by them. The manager stated this car was fixed and safe enough that he would put a family member in it. This vehicle was picked up from the Hyundai Dealership, was driven on the highway, and an audible and visual warning along with multiple dash lights popped up. This vehicle stopped accelerating at highway speed, and it was necessary to call immediately call 911. Law Enforcement responded, and assisted. This vehicle could not clear the shoulder of the highway, and one of the Law Enforcement vehicles was required behind this vehicle. This vehicle was towed again. The Hyundai Dealership had this vehicle for 14 days. The trouble code from this vehicle is P1326.",

I've been doing oil changes per manufacturer recommendations since purchase.   At roughly 40k to 60k on the odo, I noticed the car was burning a lot of engine oil. I brought my car to my local Hyundai service center, Tustin Hyundai, who told me 1 qt every 1k mi is normal. I thought it was a lot, but Tustin Hyundai told me there was nothing wrong with the car.   Sometime after, I received mail about the Theta 2 engine recall to get the knock sensor install/update, and read about the risk of engine explosion/fire. I promptly got it done. Around this time, I read on Hyundai owner forums that excessive oil consumption is a precursor symptom to catastrophic engine failure.   Sometime later, I noticed my car was burning a lot of oil, even more than before. I estimated at least 2 qts every 1k mi.   I brought my car to Tustin Hyundai at roughly 75k mi on the odo. They started an oil consumption test, comprised of 3 oil level readings, each one every 1k mi. My car failed the first two. After the 2nd, my car stayed at Tustin Hyundai overnight to get a combustion chamber clean done. Tustin Hyundai told me doing so will solve the problem.   Few months later, I noticed my engine was back to even more excessive oil consumption. I estimated at least 3~4 qts per 1k mi.  I brought my car to Tustin Hyundai again, with roughly 80k mi on the odo. They said Hyundai corporate is rejecting all further service because my car isn't CPO, and that I ran out of powertrain warranty at 5 yr/60k mi.  I called Huntington Beach Hyundai, who confirmed my car is CPO, and still has the 10/100 powertrain warranty.

Had I known about the recall, I would\u2019ve addressed it and prevented the engine failure. It is currently sitting at a Hyundai dealership as they are working with me to try to get Hyundai to cover the costs of the engine failure. So far, they refuse.  My safety was put at risk due to the car stalling out on me at any given moment. I cannot and have not been able to safely drive this vehicle therefore, it has been sitting mostly unused as I continue to make payments on it over the last 6 months.  This problem is a reoccurring issue with my vehicle and others and there is a class action lawsuit against Hyundai for it, in which I missed the deadline because I just recently became aware of this.  The vehicle has been inspected by a dealer and was noted as \u201ccatastrophic engine damage\u201d needing a $7,000 new engine.  The engine light first turned on about 6 months ago for me, but I was in the process of moving across the country that same week, so I put repairs on hold until I was settled in to my new area. Now that I have the time, and after the car had been sitting for 6 months, I took the car in to a dealer where they told me the bad news.  It is worth also mentioning that this is the 2nd time I\u2019ve had damage done to my vehicle due to lack of recall notice. However, the 1st time my car was damaged, the dealer was able to fix the issue free of charge. This time around, they are needing to charge me $7,000 but are pushing that I get Hyundai to cover the costs due to the reoccurring issues with these recalled engines and their failures. I regularly maintained my vehicle and kept most of that documentation, so I know I did my part in taking care of my car. This is simply due to lack of recall notice that could\u2019ve prevented a large bill for myself and my car being out of commission and unsafe to operate without probable cause of an engine fire.

It was towed to a dealer and the engine was found to be seized. Luckily Hyundai had just sent out a recall letter to me cautioning about a faulty engine. (There are now lawsuits against Hyundai for this same reason).Hyundai replaced the engine. Meanwhile I found their campaign reimbursement page (case #17706103) and submitted all my out of pocket cost since the first check engine light occurrence (6/10/20) through to the car rental cost which was when the car engine was replaced (6/21/2021). Sum total $2,644.55. Before Hyundai replaced the engine, they knew about the engine failure associated with my car. But they had no remedy so dealers were left with no other choice but to replace a part and reset the warning light hoping to satisfy me until Hyundai came up with a solution.

The oil is always black, it never is honey gold for long .  Because Hyundai is not giving me a new engine to resolve this issue despite all these tests and there being a lawsuit on this make /model. I now have to pay for an oil change every month rather than the average of 2 times a year.   I do feel treated unfairly and not heard by Hyundai. It does not feel right to not have this fixed.

The dealership took more than 7 days to inspect the vehicle and diagnosed it as connecting rod failure requiring a new engine. I contacted Hyundai customer service to arrange for \"alternate transportation\". Hyundai assigned me a case manager on 5/18/2021, but despite multiple phone calls and messages, I was not able to actually speak to my case manager until 5/25/2021. Hyundai refused to authorize alternate transportation prior to this, and when I spoke to my case manager she would only authorize reimbursements up to $30.00 per day for a Hyundai rental vehicle and $20.00 per day for a non-Hyundai vehicle. I have been unable to secure alternate transportation from Hyundai, as there are no rental vehicles available at the prices Hyundai is willing to reimburse me for. It has now been more than 60 days, and my dealer has notified me that there will be further delays, even though they have received all of the necessary parts to repair my vehicle. I have kept extensive notes of the more than 25 phone calls I have made to both Hyundai and the First Hyundai dealership regarding this issue.

THEY SAW THIS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR WITH 2.0 ENGINE, THEY WANT NO RESPONSIBILITY AND SAID TAKE YOUR CAR TO THE DEALER & OPEN CASE  THE ENGINE HAS A SERIOUS FLAW, IT BURNS THE OIL WITH THE GASOLINE.  THEY SAID A RECALL? DOCUMENTS ATTACHED.  I WENT TOTEXAN HYUNDAI, PUT MY CAR THROUGH A SERIES OF TESTS EVERY 1000 MILES.  I WAS TOLD THE ENGINE CAN BE REPLACED YOU IN THE 10 YRS, HOWEVER YOU OVER THE 100K MILES,WILL  NOT B COVERED, A HYUNDAI MOTORS WOULD COVER 50% . WAS TOLD ENGINES LAST 250-300K MILES.

AFTER SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND A PROPOSAL FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INCLUDING MANY HYUNDAI AND KIA CARS. THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDED ALL HYUNDAI SONATA VEHICLES YEARS 2011-2018 AND SOME 2019 VEHICLES. MY CAR IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE CARS AFFECTED. I AM SEEKING HELP FROM THE NHTSA SO THAT HYUNDAI CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CARELESS MISTAKES THAT HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN MANY ACCIDENTS AND CAR FIRES. A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WILL BE LOOKING AT MY CAR ON JANUARY, 6TH 2020. I'M ANTICIPATING THEM TRYING TO BRUSH THIS UNDER THE RUG AND BLAMING THE ISSUES ON ME DESPITE HAVING THE CAR FOR ONLY 90 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE ALONG WITH THE ABUNDANT KNOWLEDGE OF HYUNDAI AND KIA KNOWINGLY USING FAULTY ENGINES. I NEED YOUR HELP TO ENSURE THEY FIX THEIR MISTAKES AT NO COST TO ME AND OTHER OWNERS.
