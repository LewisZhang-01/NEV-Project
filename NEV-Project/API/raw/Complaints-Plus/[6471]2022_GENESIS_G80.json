        "summary": "I purchased a 2022 Genesis G80 RWD 2.5T Prestige. After driving the car for less than 500 miles I got a message on my dash board that said \" Check Lane Change Assist Function\" it had a picture of the road and a left and right arrow on, along with a triangle and the information icon inside it. After 20 seconds the 15.5 Navigation screen goes completely blank. The screen controls more than the Navigation. It had done this routinely everyday. We are very nervous about driving the car not knowing what else electronically could go wrong. I took it back to the dealer and they said they have no idea what is wrong. They told me that I was not the only person whom has came in to the dealership with the same issue. The dealer has no idea how to make any repairs  I have pictures of the dash when both events happen if you would like them.",
