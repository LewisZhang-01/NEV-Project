I SPENT AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME UNTIL I LOCATED THE FAILED PART FROM MY TRUCK. I WAS VERY DISMAYED WHEN I DISCOVERED THIS TINY CABLE WAS ALL THAT RETAINED THE SPARE TIRE UNDER THE TRUCK. UPON INSPECTING EQUAL MODEL TRUCKS AT CAR LOTS I FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO SAFETY DEVICES TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE EVENT OF CABLE FAILURE. THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF CORROSION, FRAY OR ANY RUBBING OF THE CABLE. IT SIMPLY BROKE CLEAN.

ALSO, I AM  VERY UPSET AT THE LIABILITY THAT THIS COULD HAVE PUT ME IN. I HAVE NOT HAD THE TRUCK REPAIRED NOR WILL I HAVE THE TRUCK REPAIRED WITH THE ONGOING FEAR IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

UPON MOVING THE STEERING COLUMN UP AND DOWN WITH THE TILT FEATURE I WAS ABLE TO GET THE FAN GOING AGAIN AND THE SMOKE STOPPED.  THIS HAS HAPPEN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITHOUT SMOKE HOWEVER.  THIS HAPPENS ON A RANDOM CYCLE WITH NO APPARENT PATTERN OF FREQUENCY.  IT ONLY SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN TILTING THE WHEEL FROM TIME TO TIME .  AFTER HAVING READ ABOUT OTHERS VEHICLES WITH THE SAME PROBLEM I HAVE DECIDED TO REPORT THIS TO A LOCAL DEALER.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT 7/6/00 TO REPLACE THE VAPOR CANISTER WHICH HAS BEEN RECALLED.  I WILL REQUEST A REPLACEMENT  OF THE IGNITION SWITCH FOR FREE BASED ON THE REPORTS IN YOUR WEB SITE WITH PREVIOUS OWNERS COMPLAINTS.  NEW ISSUE  THE VEHICLE HAS STARTED FAILING TO IDLE WHILE COMING TO A STOP AND THE ENGINE COMES TO A STOP OR DIES.  THIS HAS NEARLY CAUSED TWO ACCIDENTS BECAUSE THE POWERING STEERING AND POWER BRAKES FAIL DUE TO THE ENGINE DYING IN THE MIDDLE OF HEAVY TRAFFIC.  I MANAGED TO AVOID ACCIDENTS THANK GOODNESS.  THE TRUCK THEN REFUSES TO START DISPITE THE ENGINE TURNING OVER WHEN ATTEPTING TO RESTART.   I HAVE BEEN LUCKY TO MOVE THE TRUCK OUT OF TRAFFIC BOTH TIMES WITHOUT INCIDENT SO FAR.  THE TRUCK WAS TOWED 6/28/00/TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP WHO HAS DONE REGULAR MAINTINANCE ON IT FOR SOMETIME.  THIS TOW WAS THE RESULT OF THE SECOND FAILING OF THE ENGINE.  THE SHOP HAS YET TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE AS OF THIS WRITING.

I PLACED THE SHIFTER IN DRIVE AND STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT RESPOND.  IT CRAWLED FORWARD DOWN THE STREET.  I PUMPED THE ACCELERATOR AND GOT NO RESPONSE.  I STOPPED THE TRUCK, PLACED THE SHIFTER IN PARK, GOT OUT, AND THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR WITH MY HAND.  IT DID NOT HAVE ANY RESISTANCE.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND LOOKED AT THE INJECTOR PUMP WITH MY FLASHLIGHT AND NOTICED A LINK HANGING DOWN FROM THE PUMP AND IT .  THERE ALSO APPEARED THAT THERE WAS SLACK IN HE ACCELERATOR CABLE.  I LET THE TRUCK IDLE BACK TO MY GRANDSON'S DRIVEWAY AND PULLED THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD.  HE DROVE ME HOME IN HIS CAR AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED TO MY DEALER THE NEXT DAY, A DISTANCE OF OVER 50 MILES.   THE SERVICE PEOPLE EXAMINED THE PROBLEM AND REPORTED THAT THE ACCELERATOR CABLE HAD SHREDDED AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED WITH A KIT THAT CHRYSLER PROVIDES.   IT WAS NOT UNDER THE WARRANTY THEY SAID.   THIS REPAIR COST ME $344.92.

I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND SHE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD HAD THE CONDITION OCCUR PREVIOUSLY AND THAT CHRYSLER HAD A KIT TO REPAIR IT.   IT WAS NEVER A RECALL SO FAR AS ANYONE KNEW.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT CHRYSLER HAS MODIFIED THE INSTALLATION ON LATER MODELS TO PREVENT REOCCURANCE.
