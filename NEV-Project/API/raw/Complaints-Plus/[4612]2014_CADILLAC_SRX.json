When looking out the front window on a dark road, there is only a very dim, barely perceptible, lightening of the road directly in front of the car when the headlights are turned on.  When approaching another car, the headlights resemble running lights or parking lights and could easily be overlooked in snow or heavy rain.  Similar complaints are everywhere online, some indicating that internal Cadillac service memos cite defective seals that allow moisture to enter and corrode the whole light housing and that the only fix is replacing both the light assemblies for $2000...WITH THE SAME DEFECTIVE PART!  $2000 represents close to 13% of the Kelly Blue Book Value of the car. For a few months, coinciding with the initial Covid outbreak, Cadillac offered some people (not us) the option of having the light assemblies replaced and applying for a reimbursement within a very narrow time window.  I never heard about this at the time and have no idea how these people were selected for notification and contacted.   I would like to see Cadillac accept responsibility and recall the part which is obviously a huge safety issue!",

        "summary": "PROBLEM: LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ON 2014 CADILLAC SRX: With age, the low beam headlights become too dim to drive at night even though there is nothing wrong with the actual headlight bulb.  The problem is related to the materials and design of the Cadillac SRX headlight assemblies. The reflector of the low beam headlight is made of plastic with a chrome coating.  The heat of the OEM bulb deteriorates the chrome coating on the reflector until it appears as the dull white color of the plastic base material.  Without the chrome coating the low beam headlights are very dim.  Replacing the headlight bulb will not remedy the situation.  The only fix is to replace the entire headlight assembly and this is usually done at a dealership because the whole front grill/bumper must be removed).  During 2019 and 2020 Cadillac had a reimbursement program for people that complained or owners that received letters about the program which was handled by a 3rd party.  There had been complaints to Cadillac about these low output headlights but they kept this problem out of the public realm by quietly settling with those customers.  The estimate I received today from Everett Chevrolet-Cadillac in Hickory NC was $1900 to replace both headlight assemblies with factory original parts.  I spoke to Cadillac customer care today and they said they may possibly assist in the replacement but I would have to submit a written estimate to them for review.  If Cadillac is not responsible for this problem then why have they paid for replacements in the past and why will they consider paying for them now on a case by case basis?  These aging Cadillac SRX models are not safe to be on the roads with these dim low beam headlights.  Owners either have to be very careful or use their high beam headlights in night time traffic.",
