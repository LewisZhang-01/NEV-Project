I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT, HOWEVER I WAS ALMOST REARENDED BY FOLLOWING TRAFFIC THE MOMENT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN DECREASE OF SPEED WITHOUT WARNING.  THE TRANSMISSION GAVE NO WARNING BEFORE IT BROKE.  I STILL HAD 1ST AND 2ND GEARS AS WELL AS REVERSE.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A MECHANIC AND HE ESTIMATES REPAIR COSTS TO BE AROUND $3000.  I HAVE CHECKED SEVERAL FORUMS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A \"COMMON\" PROBLEM HAPPENING TO AVALANCHES THAT ARE 2-6 YEARS OLD AND HAVING AS FEW AS 14,000 MILES ON THEM.  MY TRUCK IS OUT OF WARRANTY, BUT THIS IS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE 2002 ACCORDING TO OTHER AVALANCHE OWNERS.  THE FORUMS I FOUND THE INFORMATION ON ARE; CHEVYAVALANCHEFANCLUB.COM, AVOWNERS.COM, AND CHEVYAVALANCHE.COM.  THIS IS MORE THAN AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, HAVING HAPPENED TO MANY PEOPLE WHO OWN AVALANCHE'S AS EVIDENCED ON THE FORUMS.

GM SHOULD RECALL ALL AFFECTED TRUCKS WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRANSMISSION AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION BEFORE SOMEONE IS FATALLY INJURED DUE TO A FAILURE ON A CONGESTED HIGHWAY.  AN INVESTIGATIVE LOOK AT GM'S REPAIR RECORDS TO SEE HOW MANY TRUCKS HAVE BEEN IN FOR REPAIRS, THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME OR SIMILAR FAILURES, WOULD PROBABLY WARRANT A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE SAFETY OF THIS PRODUCT, AND WHETHER GM SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO INSTITUTE A RECALL. *TR",
