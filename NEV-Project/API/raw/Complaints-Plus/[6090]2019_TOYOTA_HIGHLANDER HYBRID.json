TO DATE I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT BUT HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF CLOSE CALLS IN URBAN DRIVING SITUATION WHEN I'M MISSING VEHICLE TURN BY TURN VOICE COMMANDS.   I SEE THIS AS A VEHICLE DEFECT THAT WILL BE CAUSING SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES AS THE NUMBER OF THESE VEHICLES INCREASE ON THE ROAD*.    I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP AND CONTACTED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SUPPORT A NUMBER OF TIMES.

PLEASE HELP US 2019 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER HYBRID LIMITED PLATINUM OWNERS RESOLVE THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THKS.",
