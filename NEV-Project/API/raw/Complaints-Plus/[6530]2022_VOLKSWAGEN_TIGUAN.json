I looked around at my windows, didn\u2019t see anything, I looked up and noticed my sunroof was completely shattered with a crack in the middle where it appeared to be buckling upward. I took pictures from my drivers seat before proceeding; I had glass shards in my hair and all over my arms and back, causing small cuts on me. I was technically fine but the glass could\u2019ve gone in my eyes or larger pieces could have caused major wounds.  I called the dealership and was told to drive straight there, So I did. The glass in the middle where it was buckling started to fly off as I was driving. When I got there, they told me they had to obtain authorization before they could touch it. Initially they told me I could wait until the authorization was received. 3 hours later, they said it was going to take longer than expected but I would hear something in 24 hours. They refused to provide me with a loaner or pay for a rental car for me. I called to check the status numerous times and was told \u201cit\u2019s still pending.\u201d I received a call FIVE days later telling me that it was denied and I would have to use my personal auto insurance. I attempted to call Volkswagen of America and they were extremely rude and basically told me whatever the dealer said goes. I filed a claim with my insurance, she knew exactly what happened just by the description of my sunroof immediately after it happened. This is a HUGE safety issue that needs to be addressed.",
