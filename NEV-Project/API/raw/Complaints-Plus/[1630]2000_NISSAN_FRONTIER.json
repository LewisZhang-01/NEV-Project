After several failures, the vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who physically held the bulb in place inside the assembly. After letting go of the bulb, the failure recurred. The local dealer and manufacturer were contacted and informed of the failure. The manufacturer notified the contact of NHTSA Campaign Number: 99V347002 (Exterior Lighting) however, the VIN was not included. The contact was then referred to NHTSA for assistance.

SINCE THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION BOTS WERE USED NISSIAN HAS INCRESED THE REPLACEMENT BOLT IN DIAMETER AND FROM A #5 HARDNESS TO A # 8 HARDNESS BOLT.  THE PROBLEM IS THEY ONLY REPLACE THE FAILED BOLT THAT FAILS IF IT IS IN WARRANTY. IN  BOTH 2000 TRUCKS WE OWN THE LEFT FRON BOLTS HAVE FAILED WITH AFFECT SWAY CONTROL OF THE TRUCKS  NISSAN CLAIMS THEE IS NOT A PROBLEM, BUT THE LOU FUSZ NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN ST. LOUIS ADMITTED THAT THE STOCK THE BOLTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A HIGH FAILURE RATE WITH TE TRUCKS THAT ARE COMING INTO THEIR DEALERSHIP.  PERHPS IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT HOW MANY TRUCKS ARE OUT THERE WITH BROKEN SUSPENSION SYSTEMS.  THE FIRST FAILED TRUCK WAS DICOVERED BY AN ALERT SERVICE INSPECTION TECH WERE WE SERVICE OUR VEHICLES.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN NISSAN IS WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE.*AK",
