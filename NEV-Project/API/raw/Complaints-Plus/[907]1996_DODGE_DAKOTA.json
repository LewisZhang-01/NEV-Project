THE PARKING   BRAKE WAS BROKEN. THE LOCAL DEALER REPLACED IT. MY 100-POUND WIFE JUST   BROKE IT AGAIN. SO, WHAT IS UP WITH THIS?  COMMENTS:  ---------  THE FIRST TIME I HAD IT REPLACED THE DEALER TOSSED OUT THE BROKEN BRAKE ACTUATOR RATHER THAN RETURNING IT TO ME. AN INSPECTOR FROM CHRYSLER MOTORS STOPPED BY MY HOUSE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. IN THAT INCIDENT I WAS ALMOST RUN OVER BY THE TRUCK WHEN THE BRAKE FAILED. HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO WITHOUT THE BRAKE ACTUATOR TO INSPECT. A PARKING BRAKE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD EVER FAIL IN THE LIFE OF A VEHICLE. WHY IS THIS ONE BREAKING SO OFTEN?
