Hyundai has replaced the transmission 3 times and they still could not fix it. After the third replacement they said it's normal and that other Sonatas make that noise. That cannot be true. They did not replace the transmission 3 times if that noise is normal.  If it IS true and other Sonatas make that noise, there may be a defect that will turn dangerous in other Sonatas. The second time the transmission was replaced, the service manager told me they found metal fragments in the transmission fluid. I don't know what problem this defect will cause later on. If you would like to inspect my car to determine if this is dangerous, I can make it available. Thanks!
