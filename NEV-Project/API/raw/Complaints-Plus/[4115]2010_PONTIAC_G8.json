        "summary": "THIS PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED 4 DIFFERENT TIMES NOW.  THE FIRST TIME WAS IN DECEMBER 2013, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON  THE DASHBOARD AND THE POWER STEERING ASSIST WENT OUT.  SHE COULD BARELY TURN THE WHEEL MANUALLY.  SHE HAD TO DRIVE THE CAR 2 MILES TO A SAFE LOCATION WHERE SHE COULD PULL OFF THE ROAD.  THE REMAINING 3 OCCURRENCES HAPPENED TO MYSELF WITH MY WIFE IN THE CAR.  SAME THING HAPPENED EACH TIME, GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT TURNS ON AND THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT.  THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED WHICH WAS JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, 4/6/14, WE WERE MERGING ON TO THE FREEWAY AT ABOUT 60 MPH AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT.  LUCKILY THE CARS AROUND ME WERE PAYING ATTENTION AND WERE ABLE TO VEER OUT OF THE WAY AS I COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL HARD ENOUGH TO STRAIGHTEN THE CAR OUT. I ENDED UP ACROSS 2 LANES OF TRAFFIC BEFORE I COULD THE GET THE CAR STRAIGHTENED OUT. NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED BUT IT COULD HAVE ENDED BADLY.  TURNS OUT THAT GM HAS RECALLED THE 2005-2009 PONTIAC G6 MODELS RECENTLY FOR THE SAME POWER STEERING ISSUE, BUT SINCE MINE IS A 2010 MODEL IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  *TR",
