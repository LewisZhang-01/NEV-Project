ON 11/10 - 11/11/17, DRIVING FROM FT MYERS, FL TO KNOXVILLE, TN, ON I-75, AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF 55-80 MPH, WHILE CHANGING LANES, VEHICLE WOULD START TO STEER SMOOTHLY EITHER TO LEFT OR RIGHT, AND THEN SUDDENLY THE VEHICLE WOULD SURGE (DART) MORE TO LEFT OR RIGHT.  TO ME IT ACTED LIKE IF TURNING LEFT, THE LEFT WHEEL SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED SOME DRAG, LIKE IN MUD OR SAND AND SAME FOR RIGHT TURNING, THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL ACTED AS IF IT HIT SOMETHING TO CAUSE DRAG OR RESISTANCE WHICH WOULD MAKE THE VEHICLE ACT LIKE IT WAS OVER-STEERING.  HAPPENED OFTEN.  MAKES DRIVER FEEL SOME DEGREE OF LOSS OF CONTROL",
