MECHANIC REPLACED THROTTLE BODY POSITION SENSOR(?).  SOON AFTER, VEHICLE STARTED TO JUST DIE WHILE DRIVING.  NO NOISE, RATTLES, NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS, JUST WOULD SHUT OFF LIKE THE KEY WAS TURNED OFF.  DIDN'T MATTER THE TERRAIN OR SPEED, JUST WHILE DRIVING.  INITIALLY IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY RESTART.  IT SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THE HOTTER WEATHER.  AND IT  SHUTS DOWN AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 20 MINS WHEN THE ENGINE HAS REALLY WARMED UP.  I FINALLY NOTICED A NO BUS MESSAGE ON THE ODOMETER-WHICH FROM RESEARCHING MEANS THE COMPUTER ISN'T COMMUNICATING.  MECHANIC UNABLE TO PULL A CODE, SAID IT'S CLEARING ITSELF OUT RIGHT AFTER IT THROWS IT.  TODAY WENT IN, AND WE GOT LUCKY AND HOOKED MACHINE WHILE CAR WAS RUNNING AND IT DIED.  AND THE SCANNER WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE NOR COMMUNICATE WITH THE PCM.  NUMEROUS ISSUES WITH DODGE/CHRYSLER VEHICLES FOR THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A SINGLE FIX FOR IT.  SOME A NEW PCM WORKED, SOME OTHER SENSORS, ONE SAID JUST LOOSENING THE SCREWS ON THE PCM WORKED FOR HIM, SOME NOTHING WORKED.

A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE CAME OUT OF MY HEATER VENTS, IT SMELT OF BURNT PLASTIC AND SULFUR. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT HAPPENED ALL MY DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND STARTED DINGING AT ME, AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE METER WENT FROM OVER 18 TO UNDER 14. I WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A LOCAL BUSINESS, AND PARKED THE VEHICLE, I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND POPPED THE HOOD. UNDER THE HOOD IT SMELT EVEN STRONGER OF BURNT PLASTIC. I CHECKED THE OIL, THINKING THAT MAYBE I HAD AN OIL LEAK AND LOST ALL THE OIL I HAD JUST PUT INTO A WEEK BEFORE, BUT THE OIL WAS FINE. THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS FINE. ALL FLUIDS WERE FINE. THE VEHICLE HAS NOT STARTED SINCE AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I NEED TO GET ALL NEW ELECTRICAL WIRES, COSTING ME ABOUT $5,000, I HAVE NOT YET PAID TO HAVE THE WORK DONE BECAUSE I HAVE READ ABOUT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE TO COVER. MY TRUCK HAD TO BE TOWED HOME AND HAS NOT STARTED SINCE. I PAID A LITTLE OVER $5,000 FOR THE DURANGO, AND I'M NOT YET DONE PAYING IT OFF, AND UNTIL THIS IS LOOKED INTO FURTHER I AM NOT GOING TO PUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO IT AS IT WILL COST ME TO JUST GO GET A NEW ONE OF THE SAME YEAR.",

WHEN I FINALLY GOT HOME I SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THERE A MANY MANY SITES THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!!!!  A RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.   *JS",

SINCE THIS OCCURRED WITHOUT WARNING, I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I TURNED ON THE CAUTION BLINKERS. THERE WERE MANY CARS BLOWING THEIR HORNS, WAITING BEHIND ME ON THIS ONE LANE ROAD. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES THE ENGINE STARTED AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A ONE TIME ONLY OCCURRENCE. I HAD NO PRIOR PROBLEMS WITH THE TRUCK. A FEW DAYS LATER, I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC AND THE TRUCK SUDDENLY SHUT OFF AGAIN. OMG, I WAS NERVOUS, SCARED AND REALLY BELIEVED THAT I WAS GOING TO DIE BECAUSE SOMEONE WOULD RAM THEIR VEHICLE INTO MINE. WHAT DRIVER WOULD SUSPECT THAT MY TRUCK SUDDENLY DIED WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT? I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW I WAS GOING TO GET THIS VEHICLE SAFELY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITHOUT ENDANGERING MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OTHER DRIVERS. LUCKILY I DID IT. MY HUSBAND TINKERED WITH THE COMPUTER AND NOTICED THAT WHEN HE REPOSITION THE COMPUTER THE ENGINE WOULD START AGAIN. BUT I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT UNTIL WE PURCHASE ANOTHER COMPUTER. THE CAR REPAIRMAN SAID, EVEN IF WE PURCHASED ANOTHER COMPUTER HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHUT COMPLETELY DOWN. THE COMPUTER IS OVERHEATING DUE TO THE LOCATION THAT THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE CHOSEN. I WILL GET SOMEONE TO DESIGN SOME SORT OF HEAT SHIELD OR SOMETHING TO PREVENT THE COMPUTER FROM OVERHEATING. TO REPLACE MY CURRENT COMPUTER WILL COST $1100. I THINK THE CAR COMPANY SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS FLAW AND RECALL THE VEHICLE.

THE SUV LURCHED AND AFTER MANAGING TO GET TO THE EMERGENCY LANE THROUGH MODERATE TRAFFIC, WE DISCOVERED THE LEFT REAR STEEL BELTED RADIAL HAD SEPARATED COMPLETELY FROM ITSELF INTO SHREDS AND COMPLETELY FROM THE RIM.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AT DODGE STATED IN AN E-MAIL TO ME THAT IT IS NOT REQUIRED AND THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR IT, NOR DO IT AS PART OF THE RECALL. I AM HOPING THAT YOU COULD TELL ME WHICH PARTY IS CORRECT HERE AND ADDITIONALLY WOULD ASK FOR YOUR ADVISE ON HOW I CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND ANY HELP YOU COULD PROVIDE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *AK",

THE BALL JOINTS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE SUSPENSION, STEERING, AND SAFETY OF ANY VEHICLE, PASSENGERS, AND OTHERS.  IF THE BALL JOINTS SHALL FAIL, AS MANY HAVE INDICATED HAVE DONE ON DODGE DURANGO'S, THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS INJURY, DAMAGE, AND POTENTIAL DEATH FOR THOSE INVOLVED.  I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE TIRES TO DUE UNEVEN WARE, WHICH I HAVE BEEN TOLD COULD BE DUE TO THE BALL JOINTS.  WITH THE HISTORY OF THE BALL JOINT PROBLEMS WITH DODGE DURANGO\u0019S, THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON DODGE DOESN'T RECALL THEM.  DODGE'S LIABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT RECALLING THEM WILL BE FAR MORE DRAMATIC AND FINANCIALLY NEGATIVE AFTER MORE BALL JOINTS FAIL CAUSING MORE ACCIDENTS, INJURIES, AND DEATHS RESULTING IN LAWSUITS.   FOR ONE WOULD HATE TO SEE ANYONE HURT OR KILLED DUE TO DODGE'S NEGLIGENCE.  ESTIMATE TO FIX IS AROUND $1600 FOR THE BALL JOINTS IN THE FRONT END.  THE CV JOINTS WILL ALSO NEED REPAIRING.

DURANGO'S RECORD FOR INFERIOR UNDERCARRIAGE SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE AUTO INDUSTRY TO DEMAND COMPENSATION TO ALL OWNERS OF THE DURANGO.

DO THEY REALLY EXPECT PEOPLE WITH THESE PROBLEMS TO BUY A NEW MOTOR FOR 6,000, AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF IT!!!! OUR DURANGO IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. CHRYSLER IS TRYING TO IGNORE US, TO TRADE FOR A NEW VEHICLE, WE WILL LOSE AROUND 4 THOUSAND DOLLARS AND OUR PAYMENTS WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE THEN WE CAN REALLY AFFORD. WE STILL OWE $14,000 ON THAT PIECE OF CRAP. THEY NEED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND TOYOTA DID WHEN THEY HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH SOME OF THEIR MODELS, OR DO SOMETHING!!!!

IT BECAME EVIDENT TO US ON A RECENT CAR TRIP THAT THE REAR BENCH SEAT DOES NOT LOCK INTO POSITION.  MY HUSBAND AND I CAN EASILY PUSH ON THE SEATBACK FROM THE REAR AND IT WILL FOLD TO THE FLOOR.  WE IMMEDIATELY ENVISIONED THE SAFETY HAZARDS THIS COULD IMPOSE ON ANYONE RIDING IN THE REAR BENCH SEAT, ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN.  A REAR END COLLISION COULD SEND ANYONE FLYING FORWARD, EVEN IF THEY HAD THEIR SEATBELTS IN PLACE.     I TURNED TO MY OWNERS MANUAL FOR ANSWERS AND IT GIVES A WARNING TO \"MAKE SURE THE CUSHION IS PROPERLY ENGAGED UNDER THE SEATBACK TO PROPERLY LOCK THE SEATBACK IN THE RIDING POSITION\".  IN OUR EXPERIENCE THIS POSITIONING DID NOT LOCK THE SEAT.  I CONTACTED TWO DEALERSHIPS EXPRESSING MY CONCERN AND GOT NO REAL ANSWERS.  CHAMPION DODGE IN BARRINGTON SAID IT WAS UNSAFE FOR CHILDREN TO BE PLACED IN THE BENCH SEAT.  VIKING DODGE OF CRYSTAL LAKE SIMPLY SAID THAT IF IT WAS IN THE OWNERS MANUAL IT MUST BE TRUE.  I THEN CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER FOR DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORPORATION AND THEY SAID IT WAS UNSAFE FOR CHILDREN TO RIDE IN THE BENCH SEAT AND THAT THERE IS NO LOCKING MECHANISM.     GIVEN THIS INFORMATION I FEEL THAT ANYONE WHO RIDES IN THAT BENCH SEAT IS AT RISK FOR SERIOUS INJURY.  IT IS A SMALLER SEAT AND I COULD SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTING TO PLACE CHILDREN BACK THERE.  A LOT OF PARENTS COULD BE USING THAT SEAT FOR EXTRA CHILDREN THEY ARE TRANSPORTING IN CAR POOLS.  I FEEL THIS SAFETY CONCERN NEEDS TO PUBLICIZED TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY.

WE HAD SLOOPY STEERING ISSUES. WHEN GOING OVER A BUMP WHILE TRAVELING ON THE FREEWAY THE STEERING WOULD WOBBLE AS IF TO ALMOST LOSE CONTROL.  WHEN TRAVELING ON ALL OVER PASSES WITH THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED, IT WILL LOSE TRACTION FOR A SHORT PERIOD CAUSING THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN BY ITSELF WHICH RESULTS IN ALMOST LOSE CONTROL.  WHEN YOU ARE TURNING FREEWAY \"CORNERS\" AT HIGHER SPEEDS IT FEELS TOP HEAVY AS IF YOU COULD ROLL OVER DUE TO INSTABILITY OF SUSPENSION & STEERING.  IT MAKES CLICKING NOISES FROM THE REAR END.  WE HAVE BOUGHT 2 COMPLETE SETS OF TIRES NEW TIRES AND 3 FRONT END ALIGNMENTS SINCE WE HAVE HAD THIS DURANGO.  SEARS SAID THE ALIGNMENT WAS COMPLETED AS BEST AS POSSIBLE, IT WAS ALMOST OUT OF SCOPE AS IT WAS, THE CASTER AND CAMBER BEARLY MEETS THE SPECIFICATIONS.  WHILE TOWING OUR WE FLIPPED AND ROLLED OUR 19FT TRAVEL TRAILER OVER, JUST ABOUT A HALF MILE FROM OUR HOME.  MY HUSBAND AND 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WERE NOT PHYSICALLY INJURED IN THE ROLL OVER CRASH, BUT HAVE BEEN TRAMATIZED TO THIS DAY.  THE TRAILER JACKNIFED AND DISCONNECTED ITSELF OFF THE BALL AND ANTI-SWAY ARMS; RESULTING IN NO DAMAGE TO THE DRANGO.  HOWEVER, THE TRAILER AND PERSONAL ITEMS INSIDE WERE A COMPLETE LOSS, NOT TO MENTION THE CRANE AND THE FLATBED TOWING.  MY HUSBAND TOOK THIS DURANGO INTO A PRIVATE MECHANIC SHOP FOR AN ESTIMATE OF THE STEERING/SUSPENSION ISSUES AND WAS ADVISED TO HAVE THE RACK & PINION KNUCKLES REPLACED.  WE TOOK THE DURANGO INTO MOSS BROTHERS DODGE IN SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA AND HAD THEM CHECK THE FRONT SUSPENSION AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE RACK & PINION KNUCKLES ALL DUE TO STEERING ISSUES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THE COST WAS ABOUT $800 FOR REPLACMENT OF HUBS, BREAK MASTER CYLINDER AND FRONT END ALIGNMENT.  MOST OF OUR COMPLAINTS STILL EXIST WHILE DRIVING THIS 2000 DURANGO TODAY.*AK",

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND 1 YEAR OLD SON IN THE CAR.  WE WERE 1/4 MILE FROM TAKING A RAMP TO THE RIGHT AND ENTERING A 65 MPH EXPRESSWAY.

WHILE APPLYING ADDITIONAL BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE, THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN, BUT NOT AT A RATE SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT A COLLISION. THE 2000 DODGE DURANGO 4X4 IS EQUIPPED WITH ABS, WHICH DID NOT ACTUATE AT ANY TIME WHILE ATTEMPTING TO SLOW. PRIOR TO THE COLLISION, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS PRESSING AS FIRMLY AS POSSIBLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL DODGE DEALER WHERE THE BRAKES AND ABS WERE CHECKED. THE INITIAL RESPONSE WAS THAT VEHICLES WITH ABS DO NOT STOP THE SAME AS VEHICLES WITHOUT ABS; IF PRESSURE IS GRADUALLY APPLIED, THE ANTI-LOCK FEATURE WILL NOT ACTIVATE. THE BRAKES MUST BE RELEASED AND THEN APPLIED RAPIDLY TO ACTIVATE THE ABS. THE DEALER STATED THAT THE ABS IS OPERATING PROPERLY BUT THE FRONT ROTORS WERE OUT OF ROUND. THE ROTORS WERE CAUSING THE BRAKES TO GRAB, CAUSING THE ABS TO ACTIVATE. THE FRONT BRAKE PADS WERE REPLACED WITH OEM PADS, AND THE FRONT ROTORS WERE RESURFACED.  FOLLOWING REPAIRS, MY WIFE AND I TESTED THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INITIAL CONDITION OF FAILURE COULD BE DUPLICATED. DURING THIS TEST, THE ABS WAS ACTIVATED SEVERAL TIMES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT THE ABS HAD NEVER BEEN ACTIVATED IN THE 14 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP PRIOR TO THIS TEST. I HAD MY WIFE DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER, UNDER SIMILAR 'SIMULATED' CONDITIONS, SHE WOULD ACTIVATE THE ABS, UNDER SUFFICIENT BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE. SHE WAS ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE ABS EACH TIME THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE WAS APPLIED.

MY DRIVING EXPERIENCE WITH MY 2000 DODGE DURANGO IS SO UNSATISFYING.    PRIOR TO ME PURCHASING MY DODGE, I WAS THE OWNER OF NOT ONE, BUT TWO TOYOTA CAMRY'S.  I MADE THE CHOICE NOT TO GO BACK TO THE TOYOTA DEALER TO PURCHASE AN SUV.  INSTEAD, AS A TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION TO MY COUNTRY.  I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST TO PURCHASE AN AMERICAN MADE VEHICLE; YOU KNOW, KEEP THE MONEY AT HOME.  EVERY DAY I QUESTIONED THAT THEORY.   USUALLY I'M NOT THIS HARSH OF A PERSON, BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO MY CHILDREN'S SAFETY; WELL, I GET PRETTY PISSED.    WE LIMIT OUR LONG DISTANCE TRAVELING TIME.  I TOTALLY DO NOT DRIVE WHEN ITS RAINING, UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  ON HIGHWAYS I DRIVE AT LEAST 5-10 MILES UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT; FOR FEAR OF LOSING CONTROL.

IT WOULD DO IT SPURATICALLY, YET BASICALLY DAILY. THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD IT SERVICED SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BEFORE THEY COULD FIX IT. SINCE THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN ALL OF THE TIME THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT DUPLICATE IT. ON ONE OCCASSION THE SUV STALLED AND WE IMMEDIATELY DROVE IT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEY DID TELL US THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED ABOUT THE COMPUTER NEEDING REPROGRAMMED BECAUSE OF HIGH RPM'S WHILE IDLING. SO THEY REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER. THAT LASTED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE WERE CALLING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AGAIN. THIS TIME THEY SAID THEY COULD REPROGRAM THE COMPUTER AGAIN BUT WOULD HAVE TO CHARGE US $60.00 DO IT. FEELING THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS WE DID NOT HAVE IT DONE. IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THAT MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE DURANGO AND IT QUIT WORKING THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON AND THE ENGINE LIGHT. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND WE WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS BAD AND THEY HAD TRIED TO REBUILD IT BUT THAT DID NOT WORK SO THEY WERE PUTTING A BRAND NEW TRANSMISSION IN THE 2000 DURANGO WITH 41,000 MILES. LUCKILY WE HAD PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRENTEE AND ONLY HAD TO PAY $50.00 TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. WE HAD CONTACTED DAMLIER CHRYSLER AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE SITUATION AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR COMPANY THEY ACTED AS IF THEY DID NOT CARE. WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE, DRIVERS SIDE SHOULDER SEATBELT BOLT JUST FELL OUT, WE HAD THE REAR A/C MOTOR REPLACED, THE A/C UNIT ITSELF DOES NOT GET COLD WHICH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT STILL HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT, THE VEHICLE SHIFTS INTO GEAR HARD SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FLOOR IT TO GET THE VEHICLE TO GO INTO REVERSE, AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.

AFTER HAVING MY CAR TOWED AND CHECKED BY A MECHANIC I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS NO PIN HOLDING THE WHEELBEARING IN PLACE.  THIS CAUSED MY WHEELBEARING TO COME OFF MY CAR, THE TIRE TO BURST, THE RIM TO CRACK IN 1/2 AND THE BRAKE LINE TO BE CUT.  THE MECHANIC THAT IS FIXING MY VEHICLE SAYS THAT THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT, WHICH NEARLY KILLED ME.  I CALLED DODGE TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM, TO PREVENT THIS SAME TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM DODGE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO SINCE MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IF I WANTED TO BE SURE MY CARE WAS \"SAFE\" I COULD PAY A DODGE MECHANIC TO DO A SAFETY CHECK ON MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY SUGGEST THAT I CONTACT YOUR AGENCY TO REPORT THE PROBLEM.  I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE LIVES ARE LOST.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.",

WE CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE THE NEAREST DODGE DEALER SHIP WHICH WAS APPROXIMENTLY 35 MILES AWAY IN MORGANTOWN, WV.

THE NEXT AFTERNOON WE RECEIVED A CALL NOTIFYING US THAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF OUR ENGINE WAS GONE AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE $6,000 IN ORDER TO FIX OUR PROBLEM.  WE DID DECIDED TO TRY TO GET A SECOND OPINION AND CONTACT DEMLER CHRYSLER PRIOR TO TRYING TO PAY FOR AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT.  WHEN ASKED HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN, THE DEALER NOTIFIED US THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW AND THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE ACCEPT IN MUCH OLDER CARS WITH HUNDREDS OF MILES. WE PAID THE BILL FOR APPROXIMATELY $200 FOR THEM TO TELL US THAT OUR ENGINE WAS GONE, RENTED A CAR AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AAA TO TOW OUR CAR BACK TO MARYLAND WHICH AGAIN WAS OVER 350 MILES AWAY.  THE VEHICLE ARRIVED AT OUR HOME APPROXIMATELY A WEEK LATER AND WE DISCOVERED THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT PUT OUR ENGINE BACK TOGETHER BUT PLACED ALL THE REMOVED PARTS IN THE TRUCK OF THE CAR.

        "summary": "TRAVELING WEST ON I-80,  APPROX. 10 MILES FROM SHARON PA. THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLEW UP AND SHREDDED. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF AIR PRESSURE LOSS (IE; PULLING) PRIOR TO THE BLOWOUT AND UNWRAVELING OF THE TIRE. I HAD ALL I COULD DO TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND GET TO THE RIGHT SIDE BERM. THERE WERE FIVE OF US IN THE VEHICLE.  MY ISSUE IS WITH THE TIRE MANUFACTURER, NOT CHRYSLER CORP. I WAS ADVISED BY THE DODGE DEALER I DID NOT PURCHASE THE EXTENDED TIRE WARRANTY. AS AN OWNER OF A LARGE INDEPENDENT AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE REPAIR AND COLLISION SHOP, WE EXAMINED THE TIRE CLOSELY. WE NOTED A AN OBJECT APRX. 1/4\" DIAMETER TAPERING TO A RELATIVE POINT THAT PUNCTURED THE TREAD OF THE TIRE. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A DRIED SMALL ANIMAL BONE. A HUNTER/FRIEND ADVISED ME IT APPEARS TO BE A SMALL BONE FROM A BIRD. WE HAVE SEEN MANY PUNCTURES, BLOWOUTS AT CITY AND HI-WAY SPEEDS, BUT NEVER A TIRE \"UNWRAVELED\" LIKE THIS. IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE ALL THE PICTURES INVOLVING THE FIRESTONE/FORD FIASCO. I AM ONLY LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. I NOW HAVE RESERVATIONS IN GENERAL ABOUT THE TIRES. I WAS FORTUNATE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND AVOID SWAYING INTO A SEMI NEXT TO ME. ANY ADVIDE WILL BE APPRECIATED. OUR GY VENDOR HAS OFFERED TO GIVE IT TO GY FOR THEIR ANALYSIS.  THANK YOU. RICHARD A.
