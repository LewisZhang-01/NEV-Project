I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM HAD TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN BEFORE IT COULD BE DETECTED. WE HAVE HAD THE CAR A YEAR AND A HALF AND NOW THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURED. MY SON WHO WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME WAS PLACED IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION AS THE CAR VIBRATED AND DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  AN ORANGE LIQUID LEAKED OUT OF THE TAIL PIPE AND WHITE SMOKE ALSO POORED OUT OF THE PIPE. HE MANAGED TO PUSH THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC I HAVE KNOW FOR QUITE SOMETIME, HE INFORMED ME IT WAS DEFINATE HEAD GASKET PROBLEMS. I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR CO, THEY WERE EXTREMELY RUDE AND TOLD ME THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE HANDLED WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS PAST THE WARRANTY OF 7 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES. THE CAR HAS 85,000 MILES AND I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. MY COMPLAINT IS WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE. I WAS NOT TOLD WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THAT THERE WAS ANY SORT OF PROBLEM THAT MIGHT OCCUR BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE DEFECTIVE PART. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD LOOK INTO THIS MATTER ASAP. WHEN I WAS ON-LINE I FOUND NUMEROUS MUSTANG OWNERS THAT ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME.

THIS WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED TO ALL VEHICLES LESS THAN 7 YEARS OLD AND TO ALL THAT HAVE LESS THAN 100,000 MILES.

THIS UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED ON I-75 IN OHIO, 200 MILES AWAY FROM HOME.  I WAS FORCED TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED, AND WAS STRANDED FOR THE NIGHT.  I FOUND A MECHANIC IN OHIO TO WORK ON IT.  THE ENGINE AND RADIATOR WERE DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR, AND WERE REPLACED.  THE COST OF THIS WAS NEARLY $4,500, NOT COUNTING FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT I SPENT ON A RENTAL VEHICLE WHILE IT WAS REPAIRED.

WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO CHECK INTO WHY THE FORD MUSTANG WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL ALONG WITH THE WINDSTAR, TAURUS??  I HAVE HAD AN OVERHEATING PROBLEM, CAR LEAKING WATER, HEATER NOT WORKING PROPERLY, AND HAD A MECHANIC LOOK AT IT AND TOLD ME IT WAS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  AND TOLD ME ABOUT THE RECALL WITH THE OTHER TWO FORD MODELS, CHECK TO SEE IF MUSTANG INCLUDED. I CALLED AND IT WASN'T ,,, WHY NOT??? THIS REALLY CONFUSES ME AS TO WHY MUSTANGS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, IF SAME MOTOR, SAME PROBLEM, WHY NOT RECALLED? PLEASE FOLLOW UP WITH ME BY MAIL OR PHONE AND EXPLAIN TO ME WHY? *AK",

THEY TESTED THE RADIATOR AND RAN THE CAR, AND IT DID NOT OVERHEAT AGAIN. THE PRESSURE IN THE RADIATOR WAS GOOD. THEY REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT, THINKING THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN STICKING. TWO WEEKS LATER, I DROVE MY CAR FOR A 5 MINUTE DRIVE AND WHEN I REACHED THE DESTINATION, IT WAS OVERHEATING. I TOOK IT IN TO THE SHOP AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY SAID THE HEAD GASKETS THAT WERE GOING BAD AND WERE CAUSING THE PROBLEM. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 3.8 V6? THE SHOP TOLD ME THEY HAD DONE SIMILAR WORK ON THIS ENGINE, AND THEY THINK IT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE, ORIGINATING WITH WHEN IT IS MANUFACTURED. MY CAR HAS 46,000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE OWNED IT FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. I RESEARCHED THE CAR PRIOR TO BUYING IT. I AM UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS SITUATION WITH MY CAR AND WONDER IF I MAY WANT TO SELL IT, BECAUSE OF THE ENGINE PROBLEM. I JUST SPENT $900 FOR THE NEW THERMOSTAT AND HEAD GASKETS, NOT TO MENTION THE NEARLY TWO WEEKS I HAVE SPENT WITHOUT A CAR. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE RECALLED. THANKS.",
