I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HADN'T EVEN STARTED WORK ON THE VEHICLE AND THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AFTERNOON BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE SOMEONE AVAILABLE TO DO THE WORK.  SINCE HAD BEEN ASSURED BOTH WHEN MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND AGAIN WHEN SHOWING UP FOR THE APPOINTMENT THAT THE INSPECTION WOULDN'T TAKE LONG, WE ASKED HER TO CONTACT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER.  MY WIFE OVERHEARD THE SERVICE MANAGER TELL OUR REP THAT SHE SHOULD TELL CUSTOMERS THAT THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE DROPPED FOR AN ENTIRE DAY (ANY WARRANTY WORK, THAT IS).   IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO US THAT THE COLE DEALERSHIP COULD REALLY CARE LESS ABOUT THE CUSTOMER IN REGARDS TO RECALLS AND/OR WARRANTY WORK (LOWEST PRIORITY) AND WE LOST 1/2 DAY OF TIME AND GAS TO TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.  WE ASKED TO HAVE THE CAR BROUGHT TO US SINCE WE WERE LEAVING.   OUR REP ASKED IF WE'D LIKE TO SETUP ANOTHER DATE FOR THE INSPECTION AND WE SAID NO!  WE WASTED ENOUGH TIME AND MONEY AND WE WON'T BE TAKING OUR JEEP IN FOR THE RECALL INSPECTION TO ANY CHRYSLER DEALER.    *TR",

ON HIGHWAY 90, MILTON, FL  DRIVING A 1997 JEEP CHEROKEE, 4 CARS IN TOTAL WERE INVOLVED     I WAS STOPPED FAR BACK IN A LINE OF CARS WAITING FOR A RED LIGHT TO TURN GREEN. THE LINE BEGAN TO MOVE UP SLOWLY, I LET MY FOOT UP FROM THE BRAKE AND WITHIN SECONDS THE JEEP ACCELERATED FORWARD, I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES THE CAR SLOWED TEMPORARILY BUT CONTINUED TO SURGE FORWARD IN A JERKING HOPPING MOTION.  MY VEHICLE IMPACTED THE CAR AHEAD OF ME.  I LOOKED DOWN TO MAKE SURE I WAS APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES; MY PASSENGER WAS ALREADY CHECKING AS WELL.  SEEING THAT I WAS (MY FOOT NEVER TOUCHED THE GAS PEDAL DURING ANY OF THIS) AND THAT THE CAR WAS STILL PUSHING FORWARD I WAS FORCED TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  THE OFFICER DID NOT CITE ME THOUGH OF COURSE MY VEHICLE WAS STILL RESPONSIBLE.  THE OFFICER IN HER REPORT STATED THAT SHE BELIEVED THE IMPACT, TO THE CAR MY JEEP STRUCK, WAS AT 45 MP/H BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE REAR END.  THIS OF COURSE WAS NOT POSSIBLE SINCE I WAS AT A STOPPED POSITION STARTING TO COAST FORWARD; THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE WAS DUE TO THE JEEP HITTING THE CAR MULTIPLE TIMES AS IT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE WHILE I WAS BRAKING.  AFTER THE INCIDENT THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER, NO OVERT CAUSE WAS FOUND.  THROUGH PERSONAL RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND SIMILAR INCIDENTS LINKED TO THE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM (EVEN WHEN NOT TURNED ON), BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING IT DISCONNECTED.

WHEN I CHECKED, I FOUND THAT THE CAST ALUMINUM BRACKET HOLDING THE POWER STEERING PUMP HAD BROKEN IN 3 PLACES, ALLOWING THE SERPENTINE BELT TO FALL OFF.  EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURES SHOWED THAT ONE WAS MUCH OLDER THAN THE OTHERS, SUGGESTING THAT THE BRACKET HAD BROKEN IN ONE PLACE MUCH EARLIER AND THAT THE FIRST BREAK HAD INCREASED THE STRAIN ON OTHER PARTS OF THE BRACKET, RESULTING IN THE EVENTUAL TOTAL FAILURE.  WHEN I REPLACED THE BRACKET, I NOTED THAT MANUFACTURER HAD INCREASED THE THICKNESS OF THE REINFORCING RIBS IN THE CASTING AND ADDED A NEW RIB IN THE AREA WHERE THE OLDER FRACTURE HAD OCCURRED. THE DEALER PARTS CLERK ALSO ANTICIPATED WHICH ENGINE OPTION I HAD IN THE VEHICLE WHEN I TOLD HIM THE MODEL AND THE PART I NEEDED, AND INDICATED THAT THE DEALERSHIP HAD AROUND 30 PIECES OF THE REPLACEMENT PART IN STOCK.    SINCE THE MANUFACTURER CLEARLY KNOWS THAT THIS PART IS DEFECTIVE AND SINCE THE FAILURE OF THE PART HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT, THIS REALLY SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A RECALL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MAJOR CRASHES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THIS FAILURE WITHOUT BEING ATTRIBUTED TO IT SINCE A FRONTAL IMPACT TO THE VEHICLE WOULD ALSO BE LIKELY TO BREAK THIS BRACKET, OBSCURING THE FACT THAT THE BRACKET BROKE PRIOR TO IMPACT.    OTHER MODEL YEARS WITH THIS ENGINE AND OTHER ENGINE OPTIONS IN THIS MODEL YEAR HAVE THE POWER STEERING PUMP BOLTED DIRECTLY TO THE ENGINE BLOCK (NO BRACKET REQUIRED).

THEY HAVE CLEANED THE THROTTLE PLATE TWICE, REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP, REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, REPLACED A PRIMARY COIL TWICE, REPLACED THE O2 DOWNSTREAM SENSOR, REPLACED WIRING IN THE STEERING COLUMN AND THEN THIS WEEK REPLACED THE O2 UPSTREAM SENSOR.  AND I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE HESITATION AND CUTTING OFF.  THE ONLY RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS THAT WITH THIS MANY MILES I'M GOING TO BE NICKELED AND DIMED WITH REPAIRS.  THE CAR HAS NEVER GIVEN ME ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS PRIOR TO DECEMBER.  I AM NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND AM NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON THIS CAR.

THE WARRANTY WAS TO COVER ALL REPAIR THAT IS COVER FOR 72 MONTHS OR 100K MILES.  I CONTACTED THE WARRANTY COMPANY, WARENTECH, WHO'S HEADQUARTERS ARE IN TEXAS AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SEND SOMEONE OUT TO LOOK AT THE CAR.  SOMEONE DID COME OUT LOOK AT THE CAR AND TOOK PICTURES. AFTER A FEW DAYS I CONTACTED WARENTECH AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION AND WOULD GET BACK TO ME.  AFTER SEVERAL MORE DAYS I CONTACTED WARENTECH AGAIN. I WAS ADVISED THAT THEY NEEDED ME FAX THEM MY MAINTENANCE RECORDS VERIFYING THAT I HAD MAINTAINED THE VEHICLE. I FAXED WARENTECH COPIES OF ALL RECENT MAINTENANCE RECORDS.

I AM NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE IF MY CAR CAN BE SAFELY REPAIRED AND AVOID A RECURRENCE OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU CAN INVESTIGATE MY COMPLAINT AND REVIEW THE CAUSE OF THE ENGINE FIRE IN MY VEHICLE TO DETERMINE IF IT SHOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.  CAN IT BE REPAIRED SO THAT THE ENGINE FIRE DOES NOT RECUR DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE DESIGN.",

CHRYSLER HAS SINCE CHANGED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR TANK TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, I HAD TO WAIT IN EXCESS OF 2 WEEKS FOR A TANK BECAUSE OF A (QUOTE FORM THE DEALER) \"NATIONAL BACKORDER\" ON FUEL TANKS.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM (IT'S WHAT'S CAUSING THE BACKORDER, AS BEST AS I CAN DETERMINE).  THE WARRANTY COMPANY I HAVE EXTENDED COVERAGE THROUGH (WYNNS), TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH IT THAT THEY HAVE INSTITUTED A PROCEDURE TO DENY ANY CLAIM ARISING TO CHRYSLER TANKS SINCE IT IS A PROBLEM STEMMING FROM THE CHRYSLER DESIGN.  MY REAL PROBLEM ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT WHILE THIS ISSUE IS SO FAR REACHING TO CAUSE A NATIONAL BACKORDER ON CHRYSLER TANKS, GETTING CHRYSLER AS A CORPORATION TO ADMIT THE PROBLEM IS IMPOSSIBLE (OF COURSE) ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL JEEP DEALER IS AWARE OF IT.  IF IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, I AS A CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED SOME NOTICE ABOUT POTENTIALLY CORROSIVE TANKS, OR PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS ITEM.  THE FUEL TANK FAILURE CAUSES A COMPLETE STOPPAGE OF THE VEHICLE, AS I LEARNED TRAVELLING 65 MPH ON RTE. 81S IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH MY 7 MONTH PREGNANT WIFE AND 1.5 YEAR OLD SON IN THE CAR.  I THANKFULLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, BUT IT WAS INOPERABLE THEREAFTER.  I HAVE SINCE HAD THE TANK, FUEL PUMP, FUEL FILTER, AND O2 SENSOR REPLACED AT A COST OF $1023.  WHILE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHRYSLER HALP ME OUT WITH A PORTION OF THIS SINCE IT IS THE TANK DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION THAT CAUSED THE FAILURE, I ULTIMATELY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALERT THEIR CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF THE VEHICLE SHUTTING DOWN.  *AK",

IN FRONT AND BEHIND ME WERE SEMI TRUCKS AND, IN THE PASSING LANE, WAS A CAR.  SUDDENLY I HEARD AN \"EXPLOSION\" AND MY VEHICLE SLAMMED TO THE PAVEMENT AND VEERED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT, TOWARD THE SHOULDER.  AFTER NEARLY LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO A STOP ON THE BERM OF THE ROAD.  THE PASSENGER FRONT TIRE HAD LITERALLY DISINTEGRATED AND THE VEHICLE WAS RESTING ON THE RIM.  AFTER RETURNING HOME I INSPECTED THE TIRE AND FELT IT WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MODEL TIRE.  AFTER SOME NEGOTIATING THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE TIRE WHICH BLEW OUT AS WELL AS THE REMAINING THREE TIRES.  I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT, SINCE THE INCIDENT, I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH THE STEERING.  THEY REFUSED TO DO MORE THAN REPLACE THE TIRES.  AFTER THEY REPLACED THE TIRES I TOOK THE JEEP TO A REPAIR SHOP AND FOUND IT HAD A BROKEN FRONT-END SUSPENSION PART, WHICH I HAD REPLACED.  I FEEL THIS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  ADDITIONALLY, I TOOK PHOTOS OF THE TIRE WHICH DISINTEGRATED AND HAVE THEM AVAILABLE ON JPG FORMAT, IF YOU WISH TO HAVE THEM.  I FEEL THAT FIRESTONE, INC. LIED TO ME ABOUT HAVING NO COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS MODEL TIRE.  IF I HAD NOT PUSHED THE ISSUE I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDING ON THREE OTHER OF THE SAME MODEL TIRES.

WE ARE NOT SURE IF IT IS A TOTAL OR NOT YET.  THE FRONT IS GONE.  THE CONSOL BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS IS BENT AND NOT ABLE TO CLOSE.  THEREFORE I ASSUME THAT THE INSIDE OF THE FRAME IS BENT.  OUR BUMPER WAS IN THE STREET AND IT WAS STYROFOAM.  THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY!!!  MY DAUGHTER, WHO WAS WEARING A SEAT BELT, WAS THROWN FORWARD AND DISLOCATED HER KNEE CAP.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS CAR FOLDED LIKE THIS.  THE GENTLEMAN IN THE OTHER CAR WAS FINE.  BY THE LOOKS OF THIS CAR WE ARE LUCKY THAT MY DAUGHTER IS ALIVE! THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY BROUGHT BACK TO THE DEALER BECAUSE OF MOLD AND MILDEW.  THE SEALS IN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE REAR WINDOWS AND UNDER THE CAR HAVE BEEN SEALED OVER AND OVER.  THE RUG HAS BEEN REPLACED AND SHAMPOOED OVER AND OVER.  THIS CAR IS A LEMON!!   THIS CAR IS A LEASE CAR.  I HAVE LISTED US AS THE OWNERS BUT ACTUALLY IT IS THE LEASE COMPANY.   PLEASE ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT TO DO.",
