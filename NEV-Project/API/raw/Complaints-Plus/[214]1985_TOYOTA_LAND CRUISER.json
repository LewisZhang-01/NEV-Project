IT ISN'T THE FRICTION OF THE BELT THAT CAUSES THE LACK OF BELT RECOIL BUT IT IS THE RETURN MECHANISM/SPRING STRENGTH THAT IS THE CAUSE.  MY LANDCRUISER DOESN'T RETURN THE REAR BELT EVEN IF NOTHING IS TOUCHING IT.  I SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT THE RECALL AGAIN.  TOYOTA'S FIX IS CHEAP BUT NOT EFFECTIVE.  THEY SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE RETURN MECHANISM COMPLETELY.  MY VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED WITH THE RECALL GUIDE BUT IT DOES NO GOOD.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE RETURN MECHANISM OUTSIDE OF FRICTION PARAMETERS.   I CAN'T HAVE MY CHILDREN RIDE ON THAT SIDE OF THE CAR B/C THE SEATBELT DOESN'T OPERATE. *TR",
