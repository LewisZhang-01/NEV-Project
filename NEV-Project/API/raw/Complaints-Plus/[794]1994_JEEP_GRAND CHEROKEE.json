THEN VERY AUDIBLE  NOISES STARTED  COMING  FROM  THE  FRONT-END UNDERCARRIAGE EVERYTIME  YOU BACK-UP,..OR  HIT  A  POTHOLE,...ESPECIALLY  AT  LOW SPEED.

MAN INFORMED ME TO TAKE IT SLOW ON WAY HOME BUT GET IT LOOKED AT VERY SOON.ON MY WAY BACK,  THE RADIATOR FAN STARTED MARKING A NOISE LIKE IT WAS HITTING SOMETHING.

ALSO SAW THAT THE FAN BLADES HAS SHEARED OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE SHROUD. CUT WAS FRESH. NOW THE FAN WAS STILL HITTING THE SHROUD BUT ONLY WHEN I ACCELERATED FOR TAKE OFF. NEXT DAY, JEEP RUNNING LOUD & ROUGH.UPON RETURNING HOME, MECHANIC CRAWLED UNDER AND IMMEDIATELY COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE RIGHT MOTOR MOUNT.  HE THEN LOOKED AT THE ENGINE AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT SITTING LEVEL.  CONCLUSIONS WERE FORMED THAT DUE TO THE ENGINE DROPPING FROM 3 BOLTS SHEARING OFF THE RIGHT MOUNT (ONLY ONE BOLT REMAINED!), EVERYTHING HAD STARTED TO MALFUNCTION.  THE EXHAUST LEAK WAS DUE TO THE SHIFTING OF THE ENGINE.  ALSO, BRAKES WERE STARTING TO FAIL.  FAN HITTING DUE TO THE ENGINE SHIFT.
