I NOTICED A PROBLEM ON 7/25/2017 AFTER DRIVING MY VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN NEEDING TO USE THE WINDSHIELD WASHER TO CLEAN INSECTS OFF TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY. WHEN I USED THE CONTROL TO ACTIVATE THE WINDSHIELD WASHER NOTHING HAPPENED. AFTER ARRIVING HOME I ATTEMPTED TO FILL THE WASHER FLUID BUT IT WAS ALREADY HALF FULL. I LOOKED UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK AND NOTICED LEAKING WASHER FLUID. I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WAS A LEAK SOMEWHERE SO I INVESTIGATED IT. TO GET TO THE WASHER BOTTLE THE BATTERY MUST BE REMOVED AND WHEN REMOVED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BATTERY WAS LEAKING ACID EVERYWHERE. SOME ACID DID GET ON MY CLOTHING AND ATE THROUGH IT BUT THANKFULLY NONE MADE CONTACT WITH MY SKIN. THE BATTERY SITS ABOVE THE WASHER BOTTLE, PUMP, LINES, AND BATTERY TRAY - ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS WERE DESTROYED BY LEAKING ACID.

INSPECTING THE BRAKE LINES THAT FAILED, SHOWED THAT THESE LINES WERE SEVERELY RUSTED. AS A MATTER OF FACT, INSPECTING THE LINES THAT ARE VISIBLE, THEY ALL SHOW SIGNS OF RUSTING. I AM FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR THIS TYPE OF MALFUNCTION, SO I DO NOT HAVE ANY DEALER PAPERWORK TO DOCUMENT THE REPAIRS. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER OWNERS OF GENERAL MOTOR TRUCKS OUT THERE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE AND LIKE MYSELF DECIDED TO JUST REPAIR IT THEMSELVES, AVOIDING THE COMPLAINT PROCESS. OR,  I QUESTION IF, LIKE MYSELF, THEY EVEN HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT. PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THE LAST EXPRESSION OF FRUSTRATION. FINALLY, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DIE FOR THIS TO BECOME SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR A RECALL ORDER? THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS VERY SERIOUS MATTER!!!",

FORTUNATELY THE STREET HAS A WIDE BERM AND I WAS ABLE TO STEER AROUND TRAFFIC AND ROLL TO A STOP AFTER ABOUT 75 YARDS, CROSSING 2 BUSINESS DRIVEWAYS AND TAKING OUT 1 REFLECTOR.  THE CAUSE WAS A BRAKE LINE RUPTURE DUE TO RUST. AN ON-LINE SEARCH FOR PARTS REVEALED THIS TO BE A RATHER COMMON PROBLEM THAT YOUR OFFICE IS WELL AWARE OF. I UNDERSTAND SUCH RUST HAPPENING IN THE NORTHERN STATES BUT MY TRUCK IS A FLORIDA VEHICLE THAT HAS MADE ONLY ONE WINTER TRIP NORTH AND I DON'T RECALL ANY SNOW EVEN THEN. THOUGH THE OWNER'S MANUAL DOES INSTRUCT THE OWNER TO INSPECT (OR HAVE INSPECTED) THE BRAKE SYSTEM, NO MENTION IS MADE OF RUST OR THAT THE LEFT FRONT INNER FENDER MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED TO SEE THE CRITICAL AREA (FOR RUST).    WORSE IN MY OPINION, IS THE DUAL SYSTEM WHICH DID LITTLE TO SLOW MY TRUCK WHEN THE LINE FAILED. WHILE IT DOES STOP THE TRUCK IN NORMAL SLOW DRIVING, THE PEDAL HAS TO BE HELD ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND IN NO WAY DOES IT SEEM LIKE A SAFE \"BACKUP\".    I UNDERSTAND THAT RECALLS OR EVEN NOTICES TO OWNERS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN NO INJURIES DUE TO THE RUST PROBLEM. BUT HAD THE STREET I WAS DRIVING ON NOT HAD A BERM TO ESCAPE TO OR HAD THERE BEEN A PEDESTRIAN ON THAT BERM, OR ANOTHER VEHICLE IN ONE OF THE BUSINESS ENTRANCES, MY INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY TRAGIC.

I CONTINUED APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE WITH NO NEED FOR SLOWING DOWN AND ARRIVED AT MY NEXT TURN. I WENT TO DEPRESS MY BREAKS AND AGAIN THEY WERE VERY SOFT. JUST AS I WAS ALMOST SLOW ENOUGH TO TURN MY FOOT WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR. AT THIS TIME THE SERVICE BREAK SYSTEM LIGHT CAME ON ALL OF THE ALERT TONES BEGAN. LUCKILY I WAS GOING SLOW ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO COAST INTO A PARKING LOT AND COME TO A STOP USING WHAT MINIMAL BRAKING POWER I HAD LEFT. UPON INSPECTION I FOUND THAT MY RESERVOIR WAS VERY LOW. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG BECAUSE I JUST HAD ALL OF MY FLUIDS TOPPED OFF WITHIN THE LAST 15 DAYS WHEN I TOOK IT  BECAUSE I HAD 3 BROKEN HEADER BOLTS. AFTER WORK, I CHECKED THE RESERVOIR AND IT WAS TOTALLY EMPTY I INSPECTED THE VISIBLE PORTION OF THE LINES TO FIND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD CORRODED TO THE POINT OF BREAKING (LEAKING ALL THE BRAKE FLUID) AND THE REST WERE EXTREMELY CORRODED ALSO.   OVERALL, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS WILL BE THE 4TH TIME THIS YEAR IT HAS BEEN IN THE REPAIR SHOP FOR A COSTLY REPAIR. SINCE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK I HAVE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF IT INCLUDING CLEANING ALL OF THE SALT OFF IN THE WINTERS AFTER EVERY STORM AND AVOIDING DRIVING NEAR THE BEACH.

I ALSO OWN ANOTHER 2003 GM VEHICLE WITH FAR MORE MILES, AND IT ALSO HAS VERY LITTLE BRAKE LINE CORROSION.  I HAVE OWNED BOTH THESE VEHICLES FROM NEW, AND THE SILVERADO HAS LESS MILES, AND LESS WINTER SALT EXPOSURE THAN THE OTHER VEHICLE.

I HAVE LOOKED AT GM'S RESPONSE FOR THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND TEND TO WONDER HOW MANY PERSONS AT GM WOULD PURCHASE A VEHICLE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR LOVED ONES KNOWING OF THIS HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. THE COMPLAINTS ARE NOT JUST IN SALT RELATED PLACES.   EVEN IF THEY WERE DOES GM NOT BUILD THEIR VEHICLES FOR ALL STATES AND ROAD CONDITIONS??? I CAN SAY I AM ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES THAT THIS JUST HAPPENED IN OUR DRIVEWAY.

DOES NOT GO AWAY.   I WILL NOT DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN UNTIL I HAVE REPLACED ALL THE BRAKE LINES WITH STAINLESS STEEL ONES AND IT IS GOING TO BE COSTLY.   I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS NOR SHOULD HAVE ALL THE OTHER PERSONS WHO HAVE HAD TO. THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOME FATALITY HAPPENS IF NOT ALREADY.   THESE VEHICLES NEED TO BE SAFE IN ALL DRIVING CONDITIONS AND AREAS PERIOD.

SECOND INCIDENT:     ON 18 NOVEMBER 2013, I WAS CARRYING AROUND 800 POUNDS OF STONE FOR MY LIVING ROOM WALL WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AT AROUND 45 MPH, AS I WAS STOPPING FOR A RED LIGHT.  I RAN THE LIGHT AND TURNED RIGHT AND GOT THE TRUCK STOPPED.  LOOKED UNDERNEATH AND SAW FLUID DRIPPING OFF FRAME BY THE FUEL TANK.  NURSED THE TRUCK HOME THE LAST MILE WITH A FRIEND DRIVING HIS TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME.  THE REAR BRAKE LINE FROM THE ABS PUMP TO THE REAR END RUSTED THROUGH BEHIND THE FUEL TANK. NO WAY OF SEEING THIS FAILURE COMING.  MILEAGE ON TRUCK AROUND 91,500.  *TR",

WHILE DESCENDING AN APPROXIMATE 6% GRADE INTO A RIGHT HAND TURN AT BOTTOM SHE DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL TO SLOW FOR THE GRADE AND TURN AND IT WENT TO THE FLOOR, THE SERVICE BRAKE MESSAGE CAME UP IN THE DIC AND THE DOOR CHIME SOUNDED.  SHE PULLED OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS SHE WAS SHAKEN FROM RIDING OUT THAT HILL AND TURN WITH MINIMAL BRAKES AND CALLED ME.  I WENT OUT AND DROVE THE TRUCK BACK TO OUR HOME AND PUT IN  THE GARAGE TO INSPECT THE PROBLEM. ONCE UNDER THE TRUCK I FOUND BRAKE FLUID DRIPPING FROM THE SIDE OF THE FUEL TANK AND FRAME AREA UNDER THE CAB AND BED OF THE TRUCK. THE SERVICE BRAKE LINE FROM THE ABS BLOCK  TO THE REAR FRAME POINT WHERE THE BRAKE HOSE TO THE REAR AXLE MOUNTS WAS CORRODED THROUGH AND LEAKING.  FURTHER INSPECTION SHOWED ALL BRAKE HARD LINE PLUMBING TO BE IN POOR CONDITION AND ALSO THE FUEL LINES SHOWING HIGH CORROSION.    A CALL TO A LOCAL GM PARTS COUNTER REVEALED THAT GM DOES NOT MAKE A REPLACEMENT SET FOR THESE LINES AND THAT A TECHNICIAN WOULD NEED TO FIELD BEND AND MAKE UP EACH LINE. LATER RESEARCH PROVED THIS TO BE WRONG AS GM OFFERS A DEEPLY DISCOUNTED UNADVERTISED LINE SET FROM AC DELCO.    IN RESEARCHING FINDING PARTS TO REPAIR, I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH CHEVROLET/GMC TRUCKS FROM ABOUT 1999 UP ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS TRUCK OWNER FORUMS ONLINE.  DRIVING THE VEHICLE HOME AT SLOW SPEED, BRAKING WAS VERY MINIMAL WITH THE REAR BRAKE CIRCUIT OUT,AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF POOR BRAKE OPERATION, SO THEREFORE IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES WITH THE POTENTIAL OF INJURY OR EVEN DEATH WHEN ALL THE FACTORS COMBINE POORLY, AND AT THE LEAST, GM SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY OWNERS OF THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLE, IF NOT RECALL AND REPAIR THOSE EFFECTED VEHICLES.  *TR",

THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE IN TRAFFIC OR WHEN EXITING MY DRIVEWAY WHICH IS 100 FEET ELEVATION FROM THE ROAD.  EITHER WAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED I RESEARCHED SIMILAR INCIDENCES  WITH THE SILVERADO.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN DEFAULT THAT SHOULD HAVE A SAFETY RECALL.  I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES, SOME YEARS OLDER THAN THIS 2003 AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A BRAKE LINE RUPTURED.  *JB",

THE MANAGER INFORMED ME I HAD RAN AGAINST SOME CURBING-NOW HOW DOES ONE RUN UP AGAINST CURBING WITH ALL FOUR TIRES AT ONE TIME AND NOT EVEN SCAR UP THE TIRE OR THE LETTERING?  IN MY ESTIMATION THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN.  HE INFORMED ME IT WAS A COSMETIC DEFECT AND WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  THE SITUATION BECAME INCREASINGLY WORSE THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF TIME WITH NUMEROUS FLATS, UNEVEN WEAR AND EXTREME VIBRATION.  THIS IS A COMPANY VEHICLE AND DUE TO LIABILITY REASONS AND LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE RETAILER, THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN ONLY 10,000 MILES PER YEAR ON THESE TIRES.  MY EMPLOYEE CALLED AND INFORMED ME OF A FLAT ON THE VEHICLE AND THE OTHER 3 TIRES WERE AT THE POINT WHERE THE STEEL BELTS WERE SHOWING THROUGH.  AT THIS POINT I CONTACTED THE MANAGER AT THE RETAILER ONLY TO BE TOLD I WOULD BE GIVEN CREDIT OF $49.00 PER TIRE EVEN THOUGH I HAD TROUBLE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE THESE TIRES SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE RECALL LIST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUT NOW I WILL BE FORCED TO PAY FULL PRICE AT ANOTHER DISTRIBUTOR FOR ANOTHER SET OF TIRES.  THE TIRES ON OUR VEHICLES ARE OUR LIVELIHOOD SINCE THIS IS A SALESMEN VEHICLE AND MANY MORE DOLLARS IN SALES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE HAD I NOT BEEN AFRAID FROM A LIABILITY STANDPOINT.  RIGHT NOW I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS SINCE NEW TIRES HAVE NOT BEEN BUDGETED FOR THIS VEHICLE AND WE HAVE NO EXTRA ONES AT THIS TIME.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I WAS PARKED FACING A DOWNWARD ANGLE WHEN I EXPERIENCED THIS TERRIBLE BRAKE FAILURE.  AND HAD I NOT EMPLOYED THE PARKING BRAKE IN ADVANCE THERE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN A COLLISION RESULTING IN PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.   AFTER MY ATTEMPTS TO RECOVER MY TRUCK BRAKES PROVED FUTILE, I DISCOVERED A LARGE PUDDLE OF BRAKE FLUID ON THE GROUND DIRECTLY UNDER MY DRIVER'S SIDE COMPARTMENT.

WHEN TRYING TO MOVE THE VEHICLE AT LOW SPEED (IDLE) TO A SAFE LOCATION, I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO BRAKES. CHEVY'S CLAIM THAT THE \"OTHER HALF\" OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM WOULD FUNCTION WITH INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCES IS NOT TRUE IN MY CASE.  THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRABLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP IN CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS (ALLEN SAMUELS CHEVROLET, 361-884-5234).  UPON DIAGNOSIS, VICTOR LANDA (SERVICE ADVISOR) INFORMED ME THAT THE BRAKE LINE FAILED DUE TO RUST/CORROSION.  FURTHERMORE, HE STATED THAT THIS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM DUE TO THE SALTY ENVIRONMENT (GULF COAST OF TEXAS) AND THAT HE HAS A MECHANIC THAT IS GETTING REALLY GOOD AT MAKING REPLACEMENT LINES. UPON INSPECTION, [XXX] INDICATED THAT ALL THE BRAKE LINES ON MY VEHICLE SHOWED EXCESSIVE CORROSION AND SUGGESTED REPLACING THEM ALL FOR SAFETY ALONG WITH THE \"CONTROL VALVE\".  ALL THE LINES WERE CONSTRUCTED BY THE MECHANIC AT A COST OF REPAIR EXCEEDING $1800.00.  THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY BEEN ON THE BEACH LESS THAN 8 TIMES TOTAL IN ITS LIFE AND HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY WASHED AFTER EACH VISIT.  IT APPEARS, BASED ON INTERNET RESEARCH AND DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF AT ALLEN SAMUELS CHEVROLET, THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  SO COMMON THAT THE NHTSA HAS OPENED AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS ON THE PREMATURE BRAKE LINE FAILURE.  I HOPE THAT THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED BY ISSUING A RECALL SO THAT UNDUE REPAIR COSTS ARE NOT PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER FOR \"FAULTY\" BRAKE EQUIPMENT.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, I HOPE THIS IS RESOLVED PRIOR TO ANY CONSUMERS LOSING THEIR LIFE.       INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",

STOPPED & PULLED OFF ROAD TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND BRAKE FLUID WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVERS SIDE FRAME RAIL. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS OBVIOUS BURST BRAKE LINE BUT WITHOUT REMOVING INNER FENDER OR WIRING HARNESS I CAN NOT ACTUALLY SEE THE RUPTURE AND IT MAY BE CONCEALED BY THE CLIPS ATTACHING THE LINE TO THE FRAME. ODDLY THE LINES HAVE SOME RUST BUT NOTHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT IS SO SEVERE TO HAVE ALLOWED A RUPTURE. THE ATTACHING HARDWARE MAY BE ALLOWING SOME MOVEMENT IN THE LINES ALLOWING ADDITIONAL RUST TO TAKE HOLD.      I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK NEW IN 2003 IN OCTOBER I THINK AND ONE THING ABOUT IT THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE TWO PREVIOUS NEW CHEVY TRUCKS I BOUGHT WAS THE REAR BRAKES NEVER SEEMED TO APPLY AS HARD AS THEY SHOULD AND NOTHING EVEN CLOSE AS THE 2000 TAHOE OR THE 1994 SILVERADO.  SINCE THE BRAKE LINES SEEM TO BURST IN FRONT OF THE ABS SYSTEM IT COULD BE THAT THE ABS SYSTEM IS PARTIALLY BLOCKING THE FLOW CREATING A HIGHER THAN NORMAL LINE PRESSURE BETWEEN THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE ABS SYSTEM.  *TR",

UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A ROTTED BRAKELINE IN A SPOT NOT VISIBLE TO INSPECTION. THE BRAKE LINE WAS THE ONE THAT RUNS FROM THE ABS DITRIBUTION/CONTROL UNIT TO THE REAR OF THE TRUCK; AN ALMOST 12 FOOT LINE. IT ROTTED OUT WHERE THE LINE RUNS ALONG THE LEFT FRAME RAIL, ABOVE THE FUEL TANK. UPON DOING RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH MY TYPE OF VEHICLE AND UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA.  I AM NOT SURE WHY GM DID NOT USE STAINLESS STEEL FOR THE BRAKE LINES ON THESE TRUCKS OR HAS NOT ISSUES A WARNING TO OWNERS OR OFFERED TO REP[LACE THE LINES AT THEIR EXPENSE.  THIS IS A TRULY UNSAFE SITUATION! STAINLESS STEEL COULD HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE FOR A MINIMAL EXPENSE AND PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER.

MY OTHER VEHICLE IS A 1993 TOYOTA COROLLA WHICH HAS BEEN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK SINCE NEW. THE UNDER CARRIAGE LOOKS NEW COMPARED TO THE CHEVY. I FEEL G.M.

I WAS INFORMED  (DURING AN INJECTOR SWAP IN MY TRUCK) THAT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INJECTORS THAT WERE TESTED BY GM AND THEIR PARTNERS (ISUZU AND BOSCH) PROVIDED GOOD DATA FOR THE ONGOING SERVICE CAMPAIGN, BUT WILL NOT BE RELEASED THROUGH GM PARTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2010, I HAVE SUFFERED TWO BRAKE LINE FAILURES DUE TO CORROSION, WHEREIN A STEEL RIGID BRAKE LINE RUSTED COMPLETELY THROUGH, RESULTING IN BRAKE LOSS.  I LIVE IN OHIO, AND SALT IS USED ON ROADS, HOWEVER, IN MY 30 YEARS OF DRIVING, I HAVE NEVER HAD ANOTHER VEHICLE, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR MILES, WHICH SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE STEEL BRAKE LINES.  IN BOTH CASES OF FAILURE, I WAS LUCKY IN THAT I WAS NOT IN A HEAVY PRESSURE SITUATION, AND LUCKILY AVOIDED ACCIDENTS.   I HAVE NOW LARGELY REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKE LINE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE TRUCK, AT CONSIDERABLE PERSONAL TIME AND EXPENSE, HOWEVER, PROBLEMS STILL INCLUDE THE FACT THAT CORROSION CONTINUOUSLY AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSORS AS THEY INPUT TO THE ABS SYSTEM.  THEY CONSTANTLY FAIL TO SENSE WHEEL SPEED AT LOWER SPEEDS WHICH RESULTS IN ERRONEOUS ACTIVATION OF THE ABS ACTION.  THE SENSORS WERE REPLACED ONCE AT 30,000 MILES, AND THEY LASTED ABOUT 15,000 MILES BEFORE GOING BAD AGAIN.  THIS COMPARES TO A 2004 TOYOTA SIENNA MINIVAN WHICH WAS SOLD A FEW MONTHS AGO AT 215,000 MILES WITH ZERO PROBLEMS, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO STEEL BRAKE LINE INTEGRITY AS WELL AS ABS SENSOR INTEGRITY.  I CONSIDER THE BRAKE SYSTEM ON THE 2003 SILVERADO TRUCK TO BE OF VERY QUESTIONABLE INTEGRITY. *TR",

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS, AS WELL AS ALL THE PEOPLE ON A NUMBER OF GM CHAT FORUMS, EVERYONE IS WONDERING WHY GM (GOVERNMENT MOTORS)HAVE NOT SENT OUT A RECALL EITHER !!!!!!!!  I DID NOT BUY A TRUCK FOR THOUSANDS SO I COULD TURN AROUND AND SPEND HUNDREDS TO GET IT FIXED, WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY A DESIGN PROBLEM !!!!!!!! THEY DO A RECALL FOR THE GM TAILGATES BUT NOT FOR SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS A FUEL GAUGE ?!?!?!?!?! DO SOME RESEARCH AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT !!!

I DROVE THE TRUCK FOR A WEEK AND WAS PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE BRAKES WERE WORKING. THEN THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON FOLLOWED BY THE REGULAR BRAKE LIGHT. EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL, FLUID LEVEL, NO LEAKS, BRAKES SEEMED TO WORK OK BUT WASN'T GOING TO CHANCE IT.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE SPEEDOMETER STARTED READING INACCURATELY THE OIL AND BATTERY CHARGE GAUGE ARE NOT ACCURATE EITHER. I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE. I RECEIVED A LETTER STATING, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL MAY BE DEFECTIVE. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE MILEAGE. IT IS OVER THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED TO REPLACE THE CLUSTER. I HAVE OVER 200,000 MILES ON MY TRUCK. THE TRUCK RUNS GREAT AND I WOULD NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT TAKING LONG TRIPS(OVER 2,000 MILES) AS I DO BECAUSE OF MY WORK. I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MILEAGE LIMIT AT ALL. THERE IS CLEARLY A MAJOR  PROBLEM WITH THE CLUSTER. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL PERIOD, NOT JUST A LETTER STATING THERE IS JUST A PROBLEM. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AGAIN. THANKS D.H *TR",

THE LETTER WENT ON TO STATE THAT THE VEHICLE WARRANTY ON THIS ISSUE WAS BEING EXTENDED TO 70,000 MILES OR 7 YEARS, WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.  WELL, AT THE TIME I RECEIVED THE NOTICE, MY TRUCK HAD APPROXIMATELY 110,000 MILES ON IT, SO I WAS BASICALLY \"OUT OF LUCK\" AS FAR AS GM WAS CONCERNED.  AT THAT TIME, MY VEHICLE WAS NOT EXHIBITING ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS DESCRIBED IN THE LETTER.  HOWEVER, SHORTLY AFTER CHRISTMAS, 2008, MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DID BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION.  BEGINNING WITH THE TACHOMETER NOT READING AT ALL, THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED TO SPORADIC TACHOMETER READINGS, AND THEN THE SPEEDOMETER BEGAN TO BE AFFECTED.  RIGHT NOW, THE SPEEDOMETER CAN INTERMITTENTLY READ ANYTHING FROM \"ZERO\" (WHEN I AM ACTUALLY DOING MORE THAN 50 MPH) TO 110 (WHEN I AM ACTUALLY DOING ABOUT 60 MPH).  WHEN THE SYMPTOMS BEGAN TO OCCUR, I CALLED MY LOCAL GM DEALER TO SEE ABOUT REPAIRS, AND I WAS TOLD MY VEHICLE WAS \"OUTSIDE OF THE REPAIR WINDOW\" FOR THE COURTESY REPAIR, AND WHEN I ASKED HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO REPAIR IT ON MY OWN, I WAS TOLD \"ABOUT $500\".  SINCE THE PROBLEM IS (SO FAR) VERY INTERMITTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, AND SINCE I DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A SPARE $500 TO SPEND ON A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM WHICH GM HAS APPARENTLY KNOWN ABOUT FOR SOME TIME AND REFUSES TO ADDRESS BEYOND  A VERY LIMITED SCOPE, I ELECTED TO \"WAIT AND SEE\".  BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE NO ACCURATE SPEEDOMETER READING, AND MUST ATTEMPT TO GAUGE MY SPEED BY THAT OF THE OTHER VEHICLES SURROUNDING ME AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  THIS IS HARDLY AN ACCEPTABLE SITUATION.  I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES OVER MY LIFETIME (I AM 60 YEARS OLD), AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY WITH INSTRUMENT CLUSTER FAILURES.  SHAME, SHAME, GM. *TR",

I SWERVED INTO A PARKING LOT OPENING, BUT THE REAR DRIVER SIDE SCRAPED A SMALL ROADSIDE TREE.  THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ALSO ACTIVATE WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES WHILE DRIVING OVER ROUGH ROADS.

SOME DAYS THEY WOULD WORK, SOME DAYS THEY WOULDN'T.  SHORTLY AFTER THIS, I RECEIVED A \"COURTESY\" LETTER FROM GM DESCRIBING THE PROBLEMS HAPPENING TO MY VEHICLE AND ADVISING OWNERS OF A SPECIAL COVERAGE THAT WOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.  MY VEHICLE, HAVING OVER THE NUMBER OF MILES ALLOWED, DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS COVERAGE.  SINCE THAT TIME, ALL THE GAUGES ON MY INSTRUMENT PANEL HAVE GONE OUT.  I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH GM'S CLAIM THAT THIS IS \"NOT A SAFETY ISSUE\".  NOT HAVING A SPEEDOMETER, OR ANY OTHER GAUGES ON THE VEHICLE IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE!  I HAVE A FIVE YEAR OLD VEHICLE, AND I UNEQUIVOCALLY BELIEVE THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE ELEVATED FROM ONE OF A \"COURTESY EXTENSION\" TO A RECALL.  THIS DEFECT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MILEAGE ON MY TRUCK, AND I SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR THE NUMBER OF MILES ON IT!  I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT I WAS ADVISED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS OVER THE ALLOWABLE MILEAGE FOR THIS SPECIAL COVERAGE AND I COULD NOT BE ASSISTED.

MY CHEVROLET TAHOE HAS BOTH THESE ISSUES.  THEY STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE LETTER.

THINKING IT WAS MOST LIKELY A BAD HEAD GASKET (WHICH I FOUND OUT WERE BEING ERODED AWAY FROM THE \"COOLANT \"ITSELF), WE REPLACED THE HEAD GASKET.     LESS THAN ONE WEEK LATER, I AGAIN HAD TO ADD MORE COOLANT.  AGAIN WE REMOVED THE HEADS AND INVESTIGATED THE PROBLEM.  WHEN WE SEARCHED ONLINE MECHANICAL DATA BASES, WE DISCOVERED THAT MY TRUCK HAD BEEN FITTED WITH DEFECTIVE HEADS, PRODUCED FROM A PLANT IN MEXICO. WE EVEN DISCOVERED A GENERAL MOTORS MEMO REGARDING THE PROBLEM. THIS PLANT PRODUCED OVER 1.5 MILLION HEADS FOR VARIOUS VEHICLES.  IT SEEMS THAT INFERIOR METAL PRODUCTS WERE THE REASON THE HEADS THEMSELVES WERE ALLOWING COOLANT TO BE SUCKED INTO THE CRANKCASE, COMPROMISING THE OIL, AND DAMAGING OR SEIZING UP THE ENGINE.       I HAVE TALKED WITH SEVERAL SERVICE SHOPS,(GREASE MONKEY, JIFFY LUBE), AND HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS AN EVER GROWING PROBLEM, THE ONLY REMEDY OF WHICH IS TO TOTALLY REPLACE THE HEADS. THE EXPENSE TO THE CONSUMER,WHO DIDN'T INTEND TO PURCHASE A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE, RANGES FROM $1,800 TO $9,000 IN REPAIRS, AND MAY WELL EFFECT SOME SIX TO 800,000 VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.  I SPOKE TO ONE WOMAN WHO WAS DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY WHEN HER ENGINE SEIZED UP.  IT WAS A MIRACLE SHE DID NOT LOSE CONTROL WHILE DRIVING.     I HAVE CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS REGARDING SOME FORM OF COMPENSATION FOR MY EXPENSES, AND AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, THEY JUST BLEW ME OFF AND TOLD ME NO RECALL WAS BEING CONSIDERED.

IT WOULD THEN NOT START. WE FIRST HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL SHOP THAT INFORMED US THAT THE UPPER INTAKE MANIFOLD HAD CRACKED. IT LEAKED ANTIFREEZE INTO THE CYLINDERS, THE SPARK PLUGS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE ENGINE AND THE COST FOR REPAIR WOULD BE 1400.00. WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A 2ND SHOP FOR A 2ND OPINION. THEY TOLD US THAT THE ANTIFREEZE THAT LEAKED HAD TOTALLY LOCKED UP THE ENGINE AND WE NEEDED A WHOLE NEW ONE. THAT WAS GOING TO COST US AT LEAST 2,000 FOR A USED ONE. WE THAN DECIDED THAT A 4 YEAR OLD CAR WITH 60K MILES ON IT SHOULD NOT BE IN NEED OF A NEW ENGINE SO WE AGAIN HAD IT TOWED TO A CHEVROLET DEALER REPAIR SHOP. THEY TOLD US THE SAME THING. THE CAR WAS OFFICIALLY IN NEED OF A WHOLE NEW ENGINE. WE CONTACTED CHEVROLET'S CUSTOMER CARE DEPT AND THEY ARE SO FAR UNWILLING TO HELP. WE'VE ONLY HAD THE CAR 8-9 MONTHS AND ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN. PER THE DEALER, THE USED ENGINE WILL COST US 3000.00 AND A NEW ONE WILL COST IS 5050.00. *JB",

NHTSA ALSO HAS SEVERAL DOZEN, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF   REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL PETITIONS IN PROGRESS TO   DEMAND RECALLS AND / OR MEDIA INVESTIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE IS OUT   OF WARRANTY, THIS APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT WORTHY OF A RECALL.

ONCE THIS PROBLEM STARTS, IT IS VERY CONSISTENT ON ITS REGULARITY. A SIMPLE SOLUTION IS TO REPEATEDLY TURN THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTART IT. THE SPEEDOMETER WILL DROP 5 MPH WITH EACH CYCLE UNTIL IT REACHES 0 MPH. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM WILL LIKELY REOCCUR ON THE TRIP THAT I AM ABOUT TO MAKE. MY COWORKER IS HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM IN A VERY SIMILAR VEHICLE. UPON CONTACTING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THIS PROBLEM HAD BEEN SEEN ON OTHER OCCASIONS AND THE SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AT AN APPROXIMATE COST OF $600.00.  *JB",

WHILE DRIVING THROUGH ILLINOIS LAST YEAR, I EXPERIENCED THE FAILURE OF THE SPEEDOMETER. I HAD BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR 12+ HOURS AND WAS THE ONLY CAR ON THE INTERSTATE LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I BEGAN HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT SPEED AND WAS UNCOMFORTABLE IN GENERAL WITH THE QUALITY OF MY DRIVING. FEELING THAT I MUST BE TOO TIRED TO CONTINUE, I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AT THE NEXT INTERCHANGE. WHEN I STOPPED I NOTED THAT THE SPEEDOMETER CONTINUED TO READ 60 MPH. THIS VEHICLE HAD APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME.    THE OTHER PROBLEM IS MORE RECENT. THE VEHICLES FLASHERS COME ON WHEN THE LEFT TURN SIGNAL IS APPLIED. THIS IS VERY CONFUSING TO OTHER DRIVERS AROUND ME. THE MANAGER OF THE COMPANY FLEET REPORTS THAT THERE ARE TWO COMPANY PICKUPS OF THE SAME VINTAGE THAT HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED UNRELIABLE SPEEDOMETERS EARLY IN THERE LIVES.    THE CHEVROLET DEALER STATES THAT HE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE.    PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THESE TRUCKS OR AN ANOMALY.  THANK YOU,.   *NM",

ONE WEEK LATER, I AGAIN COMPLAINED THAT NOW WHEN I'M STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD GO EVEN LOWER. THE BRAKING SYSTEM WAS CHECKED OUT, THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS CHECKED, & I WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS OK, THERE WERE NO LEAKS. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS TRUCK.  I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE. IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF OWNING THE VEHICLE, THE WIPER BLADE WAS DEFECTIVE, THUS SCRATCHING THE WINDSHIELD. I HAD TO COMPLAIN TO GET THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED & THE WIPER REPAIRED. ALSO WITHING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING, THE 4X4 SWITCH HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE TRUCK WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF 4 WHEEL DRIVE LOW. ANOTHER COMPLAINT THAT THE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP WAS THE WIND NOISE DUE TO A FAULTY DOOR GASKET ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THIS WAS NOT REPLACED, ONLY TEMPORARILY FIXED, WHICH ONLY CORRECTED THE PROBLEM FOR A SHORT WHILE. RECENTLY, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, THE O2 OXYGEN SENSOR HAD TO BE REPLACED.

APPARENTLY IT HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP TOLD HIM IT WAS 4-7 WEEKS TO GET NEW PARTS OR THEY COULD SEND OUT HIS EXISTING PARTS TO BE REWORKED.  THE DELAER HAS SAID THAT A BULLITIN HAS BEEN ISSUED BUT NO RECALL HAS BEEN ORDERED.  I WOULD THINK THAT VEHICLES A YEAR OR TWO OLD SHOULD HAVE A WORKING SPEEDOMETER.  THE WAY I HAVE FOUND TO FIX IT IS TO STOP AND REMOVE THE BATTERY CABLES AND LET THE COMPUTER RESET.  SOMETIMES THE SPEEDOMETER GOES TO 120 MPH AND JUST STAYS THERE, EVEN WHEN THE TRUCK IS NOT RUNNING.  I AM WONDERING IF THIS EFFECTS MY ANTI-LOCK BRAKES OR MY MILEAGE READINGS.*AK",

I HAVE NOW HAD THREE(3) DIFFERANT SETS OF TIRES PUT ONTO THIS VEHICLE. SO THEN I E-MAILED CHEVROLET WITH NO RESPONSE. ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER I E-MAILED THEM AGAIN. THIS TIME I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM CHEVROLET. THEY HAD ME SET UP A RIDE ALONG WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER. JUST LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE TEST DRIVE, THE SERVICE MANAGER COMMENTED ON THE VIBRATION IN HIS REAR THROUGH THE SEAT. 20 MINUTES LATER HIS COMMENT WAS \"THIS WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY!\". AT THAT POINT THEY CHANGED THE REAR SHOCKS.  NO HELP. SO I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE WHAT WAS THEIR NEXT COARSE OF ACTION AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME HE WAS MEETING WITH HIS REP. AND A ENGINEER AND WANTED THE TRUCK BACK AGAIN THREE WEEKS LATER. SO AFTER I DROPPED IT OFF, LATER I GOT A CALL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THERE ARE TWO SETTING ON THE FRONT END THAT THEY WANTED TO TRY. I GOT MY VEHICLE BACK WITHOUT ANY EXPLAINATION FROM ANYONE ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE NOW. I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT BUT WAS TOLD THAT LEAVING IT THERE WOULD NOT HELP BECAUSE IF THIS DID NOT WORK THAT PRETTY MUCH TOO BAD. NO ONE HAD A SOLUTION FOR ME I WAS THEN TOLD THAT IT WAS DRIVIN' BE THE ENGINEER AND COMPARED TO SEVERAL OTHERS. THEY THEN SAID IT'S PROBABLY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, I WAS NOT GIVIN A CHANCE TO DRIVE ANY OTHER AT ANY TIME NOR DID I SEE ANY 2003 Z-71'S ON THEIR LOT. SO WHAT DID THEY COMPARE IT TO AND WHY WASN'T I GIVIN AN OPORTUNITY TO DRIVE ANOTHER?? I ALSO WORK ON A USED CAR LOT MYSELF AND HAVE DRIVEN 2 OTHER 2003 Z-71'S WHICH WE HAD AND ONE WAS LIFTED. NEITHER HAD THE BOUNCE MINE HAS.

DETAILS CONCERNING A VEHICLE INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 29, 2004, APPROXIMATELY  7:45 PM, WHILE DRIVING OUR 2003 CHEVY SILVERADO 2500HD [XXX] MY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING ON S.R. 224 EAST OF FINDLAY AT 40MPH WHEN WITHOUT WARNING,  THE ENTIRE FRONT END LOCKED UP ON THE VEHICLE (LATER DUPLICATED BY THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT LARICHE CHEVROLET IN FINDLAY, OHIO) THROWING MY WIFE AND I VIOLENTLY AGAINST OUR RESTRAINTS. THIS RESULTED IN A TOTAL LOSS OF CONTROL AND INABILITY TO MOVE THE VEHICLE FROM ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  WE WERE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROAD THAT IS FREQUENTED BY SEMI TRAILERS AND VEHICLES TRAVELING IN THE 55-60MPH RANGE, AND WERE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO MOVE.   THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT GO FORWARD OR BACKWARD.  AFTER PUSHING THE 2WD/4WD BUTTONS FRANTICALLY ON THE DASH AND SHIFTING FROM PARK TO REVERSE TO DRIVE, THE VEHICLE FINALLY MOVED IN REVERSE (2WD).   I THEN SHIFTED TO DRIVE AND WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A NEARBY DRIVEWAY.  AFTER TESTING THE VEHICLE UP AND DOWN THE DRIVEWAY, WE PROCEEDED TO GET OFF THE MAIN ROAD AND WENT DIRECTLY HOME (APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILES).  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO LARICHE CHEVROLET THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  (COMPLETE BACKGROUND OF SERVICE WORK IN MEMO PAGE)  AS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH OF US, LEAVING MY WIFE UNWILLING TO TRAVEL IN THIS VEHICLE. FORTUNATELY,  OUR PROBLEM WAS DUPLICATED BY A TECHNICIAN AT LARICHE CHEVROLET WHO IN THE MANAGER'S WORDS  \u001cYOUR TRUCK ABOUT PUT MY SERVICE TECH THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\".   BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID TO RIDE IN THIS VEHICLE, WE ARE ASKING TO HAVE CHEVROLET EXCHANGE THIS VEHICLE WITH ANOTHER EQUIVALENT MODEL.

I GOT MORE/BETTER RESPONSE FROM THEM. IF THE TIRES ARE 25% OR LESS IN WEAR, THEN THEY WILL REPLACE THEM. KEEP IN MIND, I HAD THEM \"TRUED\" WHICH MEANS I HAD THEM \"SHAVED\" TO A MORE ROUND SHAPE.
