Nobody has inspected other than a mechanic because I did not know that was even an option. No, there was absolutely no warning to indicate the issue, only the check engine light would work and that issue has been temporarily resolved. Due to research, I, along with many others, have come to the conclusion that it is a fault in manufacturing where one of the resisters in the cluster was not soldered correctly causing a failure in connection. I believe there should have been a recall on the equipment, especially seeing as how common this issue is and that the product isn't even made/sold anymore.

THE CAR WOULD COMPLETELY DIE WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. THAT LEAD TO THE POWER STEERING GOING OUT.   EVERY CODE ON THE DASH BOARD WOULD COME ON. THEN THE BATTERY WOULD JUST COMPLETELY DIE AND NEED TO BE JUMPED. IT WOULD RUN OK FOR A FEW DAYS THEN BE DEAD THE NEXT. MORE AND MORE THE BATTERY WOULD COMPLETELY BE DEAD EVERY FEW DAYS. HAD TWO NEW BATTERIES INSTALLED AND IT WOULD TEST FINE USUALLY. SEEMED THAT SOMETHING WAS DRAINING IT SOMEHOW.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER MANY TIME AND COULD NEVER GET A DEFINITIVE ANSWER.   FINALLY IN NOVEMBER 2019 I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND IT COMPLETELY DIED AND WOULD NOT TAKE A CHARGE (JUMP). STRANDED ON THE HIGH I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO COYLE CHEVROLET  ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY DIDN'T HAVE A HYBRID MECHANIC TO LOOK AT IT. THEN HAD IT TOWED TO BACHMAN CHEVROLET ONLY FOR THEM TO TELL ME AFTER HAVING IT FOR TWO WEEKS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE. EITHER THEY NEEDED TO DISASSEMBLE IT TO FIND THE PROBLEM OR I WOULD NEED  TO GET A NEW ENGINE FOR $7,000.  I HAD A CLAIM WITH GM BUT THEY ALSO JUST GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND.   THE CAR ITSELF IS ONLY WORTH $3,500-$4,500. I STILL WAS PAYING ON THE LOAN FOR IT ALSO.  NOT ONLY HAVE I NOT HAD A CAR SINCE NOVEMBER I HAVE A CAR THAT WON'T START AND CAN NOT TRADE IN ON ANOTHER CAR.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES NO RECALLS ARE ON THE CAR FOR THEM.  VERY FRUSTRATING SITUATION I DEALT WITH FOR A FEW YEARS WITH THE CAR AND NO SOLUTION FOR A FIX.  I LOVED THAT CAR AND CHEVY BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM. NEED TO INVEST IN ANOTHER MODEL I GUESS.",

WHEN I MADE IT TO THE SECOND RED LIGHT THE CAR SHUT COMPLETELY OFF THEN CAME RIGHT BACK ON.

THE CAR REFUSED TO START AGAIN AND KEY GOT STUCK .  I HAD TO GET IT TOWED HOME.  I'M BEGGING CHEVY, PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE.  I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF REVIEWS REGARDING THESE MAKE AND MODELS AND IT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING IS BEING DONE.   I HAD A 2006 CHEVY MALIBU WHICH I LOVED SO MUCH THAT I DECIDED TO TRUST CHEVY WITH MY NEXT CAR.  AS I CLOSED MY EYES THAT NIGHT I COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPEN IF I WAS ON THAT BRIDGE HEADING HOME WITH CARS TRAVELING 60-70MPH?  WHAT IF I WAS INFRONT OF A RIVER, ON A TRAIN TRACK, IN FRONT OF A BIG BODY VEHICLE SUCH AS A BUS OR 18-WHEELER OR SOMEONE WALKING IN THE DIRECTION THE CAR WAS GOING?

THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE HAD MY CAR TURN OFF WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND IN THE CITY. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE. IT'S WIDESPREAD AMONG 2013 CHEVROLET MALIBU'S.

THE BRAKE PEDAL ARM AND BOTH SIDE RETAINERS WERE REPLACED UNDER EXTEMDED WARRANTY WITH RELIEF FROM SYMPTOMS FOR ONE YEAR. FOLLOWING SUMMER AND THE SYMPTOMS ARE PERSISTING. I BRING THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY FIND THE BRAKE PEDAL POSITION SENSOR ARM LOOSE CAUSING ERRATIC PEDAL POSITION. THEY REPLACED THE BPP SENSOR AND RETAINER AND THE PROBLEMS SUBSIDE. NOW I AM ON THE THIRD SUMMER OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE AND IN THE SAME EXACT MONTH EVERY YEAR I BEGIN TO HAVE ISSUES WITH THE BRAKES NOT OPERATING PROPERLY. THIS SAME ISSUE IS BEING REPORTED BY OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE AND I AM IMPLORING THE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER BEFORE A PARTY IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.",

THIS MALFUNCTION OCCURS RANDOMLY BOTH ON HIGHWAYS, STREET DRIVING (STOP-START), WHILE MAKING LEFT OR RIGHT TURNS AND REVERSING OUT OF PARKING SPACES.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE (SCHUMACHER CHEVROLET IN CLIFTON, NJ) 3 TIMES AND THEY CLAIM THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM ON TEST DRIVING. ON THE 1ST VISIT THEY SAID IT WAS THE RADIO AND REPLACED A PART. ON THE 2ND VISIT THEY SAID IT WAS THE BATTERY, WHICH WAS REPLACED YET THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. MY MALIBU IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP AND THEY CALLED AND OF COURSE, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICAL FAILURE, THE \"SERVICE FRONT CAMERA\" LIGHT WILL DISPLAY AND AFTER THE LAST EVENT, I SELECTED THE VOLTAGE READING ON THE ELECTRONIC DASHBOARD PANEL AND WATCHED THE VOLTAGE METER FLUCTUATE FROM 13.6 TO 14.1 AS I WAS DRIVING, AND IT REMAINED AT 14.9 WHILE STATIONARY.      THIS PROBLEM IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND I PRAY THAT NO DRIVER GETS HURT BEFORE CHEVROLET TAKES ACTION TO FIGURE THIS PROBLEM OUT.  I HAD NO IDEA THAT SO MANY OTHER 2013 VEHICLES WERE SIMILARLY AFFECTED.  I AM GOING TO REPORT THIS ISSUE TO GENERAL MOTORS AND I HOPE OTHERS CONTINUES TO DO THE SAME.",

FAST FORWARD TO SUNDAY 2/2.  I ATTEMPTED TO ENTER MY VEHICLE WHEN COMING OUT OF THE STORE AND AND UPON OPENING THE DOOR, THE CHROME PIECE FROM THE TOP OF MY PASSENGER REAR WINDOW POPPED RIGHT OFF.      NOW, SEEING THAT THE NEXT DAY WAS MONDAY, I TRIED NOT TO GET TOO UPSET BY THIS, BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, WHEN A PERSON IS IN THE PROCESS OF PAYING OVER $20K FOR A VEHICLE THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING FOUR MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE.  MONDAY MORNING, I WENT TO GET INTO THE VEHICLE, AND THE PLASTIC PART BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOOR STARTED TO CRUMBLE AT THE TOP, SO MORE FRUSTRATION SET IN.  I EMAILED MY SALESPERSON AND WAS ADVISED TO BRING THE CAR IN.

AFTER CONFIRMING THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN AN ACCIDENT (BY THE WAY I TOOK OFFENSE TO THIS) IT WAS ADVISED TO ME THAT THE DRIVER'S DOOR LOOKS AS THOUGHT IT WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY, AND NOW IT IS MORE AJAR WHICH IS WHY THE ISSUES ARE HAPPENING.

THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE TIRE ISSUE.  THEY STATED THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER TIRES AND WE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH GOODYEAR OURSELVES.  UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I HAD DISCOVERED THAT MANY COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN MADE ON THESE PARTICULAR TIRES SUCH AS BULGES IN THE SIDEWALLS AND BLOWOUTS WITH VERY LOW MILEAGE.  IT'S OBVIOUS THERE IS A DEFECT OF SOME KIND AND THESE TIRES NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  MY DAUGHTER SAID SHE NEVER RAN OVER ANYTHING, IT JUST POPPED ON ITS OWN.

I HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED THIS TO  CHEVY.COM/WARRANTY, AND FELT THAT YOU TOO SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS OCCURRENCE.    \"HAD A FLAT TIRE, 6/18/13 ON MY 2 MONTH OLD MALIBU. CALLED ON-STAR, NO HELP AFTER 1&1/2 HOURS. CALLED ON-STAR AGAIN, NO HELP AFTER TOTAL OF ALMOST 3 HOURS. MICHIGAN DOT ROAD SERVICE CAME ON SCENE AND TRIED REPAIR WITH EMERGENCY REPAIR KIT. NO GOOD, TIRE DID NOT INFLATE. FINALLY CALLED AAA WHO RESPONDED IN 10 MINUTES. WANTED TOW TO DEALER, BUT DEALER (RINKE) WAS CLOSED AFTER 6:00PM. WAS TOWED HOME AT COST OF $84.00. NEXT DAY, 6/19/13, TOOK TIRE OFF VEHICLE AND BROUGHT TO (RINKE) SERVICE DEPT. FOR REPAIR AT COST OF $25.00. ASKED ABOUT REPAIR/REPLACEMENT OF CANISTER IN EMERGENCY REPAIR KIT. NO ONE AT DEALER SERVICE HAD EVER REPLACED THE CANISTER OR WERE FAMILIAR ON HOW TO REPAIR IT. WENT TO PARTS DEPT. TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT CANISTER - NONE AVAILABLE, WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED AT PRICE OF OVER $26.00. ASKED ABOUT PURCHASE OF DOUGHNUT EMERGENCY TIRE AND TOOL KIT - AGAIN, NONE AVAILABLE, WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED AT A PRICE OF OVER $400.00. WITH COMPLETE ABSENCE OF DEALER ASSISTANCE, I TOOK TIRE HOME AND INSTALLED ON VEHICLE. MY RESOLUTION TO AVOID A RECURRENCE OF THIS EVENT WAS TO GO TO OUR LOCAL BELL TIRE STORE AND PURCHASE A NEW WHEEL AND TIRE SO THAT MY HUSBAND (84 YEARS OLD) AND I (75 YEARS OLD) WOULD HAVE THE SECURITY OF A REPLACEMENT TIRE IF WE ENCOUNTERED A FLAT AGAIN. IN OUR OPINION, THE ELIMINATION OF THE EMERGENCY SPARE TIRE WAS A BAD MOVE, AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF REPLACEMENT COMPONENTS IS A SAD AND DISCONCERTING CONDITION.\"  *TR",
