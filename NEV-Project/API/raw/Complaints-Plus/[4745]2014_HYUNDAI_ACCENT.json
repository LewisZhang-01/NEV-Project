ON AUGUST 17 I TOOK MY CAR TO THE NOBLESVILLE HYUNDAI DEALER. ON THE 18TH I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A NEGATIVE COMPONENT NOT GROUNDED AND WAS FIXED. ABOUT 1.5 WEEKS LATER THE PROBLEM RETURNED PLUS NOW THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT WAS COMING ON. ON THE 31ST OF AUGUST I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER EXPLAINING THAT THE PROBLEM HAD RETURNED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2 THEY STILL HAVE NOT DETERMINED WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. PICKED UP MY CAR ON SEPTEMBER 3RD AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T GET THE CAR TO ACT UP THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO SO I TOOK MY CAR. I'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE IF AND WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS AGAIN THEN TAKE IT STRAIGHT BACK TO DEALER.",

WE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE TWO OF THE ORIGINAL TIRES  THE DRIVER LEFT FRONT TIRE DEVELOPED A GIANT BULGE IN THE SIDEWALL (THE TIRE AND RIM HAVE NO INDICATION OF SCRAP ON THE SIDE ), WE ALSO NOTICED THE RIGHT REAR TIRE IS DEVELOPING A BULGE IN THE SIDEWALL.   I JUST HAD THE  LEFT FRONT DRIVERS TIRE REPLACED AT THE ORIGINAL DEALER HADDAD OF THE BERKSHIRE  HADDAD HYUNDAI, 689 EAST STREET  IN PITTSFIELD , MA 01201 . UPON REVIEW WITH SERVICE ASSOCIATE THEY DETERMINED THE TIRES ARE NOT FAULTY AND ARE NOT COVERED AS WARRANTY. I FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE, THREE PROBLEMS WITH TIRES ON A CAR LESS THAN OLD LEAVES ME WONDERING ABOUT THE KUMHO TIRES AND THE TIRES COMPATIBILITY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ON THIS HYUNDAI ACCENT.  DEALERS COMMENTS\" I REVIEWED YOUR EMAIL WITH [XXX] , OUR SERVICE DIRECTOR AND WE ALSO SPOKE TO [XXX]  AT HYUNDAI. THIS BULGING CONDITION ON THE TIRES IS CONSIDERED A ROAD HAZARD WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. IT IS CAUSED BY POT HOLES AND WHEN THEY ARE HIT,  IT BREAKS THE SIDE WALL STEAL BELT.   THIS CAUSES THE BULGE WHICH EVENTUALLY WILL POP. THE TIRES ARE ALSO A LOWER PROFILE TIRE. \"    IT APPEARS TO ME THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THESE TWO TIRES THAT BULGED OUT, KEEP IN MIND THE RIMS AND TIRES IN QUESTION HAVE NO SCRAPS OR DENTS.. IN MY OPINION THE KUMHO TIRES / DESCRIPTION [XXX] LOW PROFILE POSE A SERIOUS HAZARD TO ANY VEHICLE THAT IS EQUIPPED WITH THEM DUE TO THE ABILITY TO DAMAGE UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS. IF AN UNSUSPECTING OPERATOR HITS A CURB OR HOLE THESE TIRES  CAN BLOWOUT.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
