I have mentioned this a several service appointments and inspections, but the dealership was never able to pinpoint the problem.

I proceeded to the stop sign.  As I was making the turn into traffic, the computer seemed to have re-booted several times in the period of a few seconds.  However, this time, my steering locked in place while making the turn, putting the front of my vehicle just over the double yellow line into oncoming traffic.  The doors locked and unlocked several times, several chimes went off, the display flashed a few times, and then, after a couple of seconds, I was able to steer and pull back into my lane.  I promptly called Chevy support to report the issue, as I believed this to be an important safety issue that Chevy would be extremely concerned with.  I was disappointed to find that the operator was not interested in taking my information, she suggested that I contact the dealership for service, which I already was in the process of doing.  I explained that I was calling to report a safety issue to Chevy, not to merely complain, and offered my VIN number.  She reluctantly checked the last 8 digits of my VIN number for known recalls and again suggested I call for service.   Dealership said that my power steering module needed calibration updates.  But, they are not sure that this will solve my issue.

It got worse on a climb, but engine runs smoothly. It seems fine on a downhill, but on a flat road & on a climb the problem continues & was getting worse. We checked the spark plug connections to make sure they are tight & secured. After a brief refuel stop in Elko, NV, we proceeded to travel again and at approximately 4:30 am 5 miles from Elko, NV, the engine went to high revolution, oil pressure to the max, check engine light came on, and the speed suddenly reduced to 30mph, transmission will not shift/or could not go any faster. Things became scary as semi truck was barreling behind us at high rate of speed and we almost got rear-ended on an icy road. We exited immediately to the next exit (Exit 314) and parked at a Sinclair gas station and called for a tow. The truck  was towed to Riverton Elko Chevy dealer. Further investigation revealed metal shavings  at the bottom of the pan which means the truck requires new transmission. Initially we were told that the repair cost would be $2.8K to change the shift control solenoid, then $4K for solenoid & valve body, then $8.5 for new transmission. The truck only had  67K miles, just 5K above the warranty expiration. It was serviced early last year (45K) from the local dealership. Prior to that, I took the truck to the same dealership for brake problem/recall and after that, for another problem with speed hesitation, loud thud under the truck when moving, and sputtering. We currently have the truck at a local mechanic in Elko, NV for an upgraded transmission replacement. We chose to not use the Chevy Dealer as their quoted repairs did not seem ethical at the time. The Chevy Dealer was helpful after giving poor service and they did tow the truck to the local mechanic without charge to us. As per the mechanic this is a very common problem on this model.",

And just about a year ago while driving an pulling trailer, I lost communication to transmission, electronic brake, park assist, trailer brakes, ect. An was forced to stop! After taking it in to dealership to fix it, they did which lasted not even a month and done it again numerous times leaving me stranded. Now just last night 11/23/2021 while pulling my trailer, as I came to a stop sign I hit my brakes and all trailer brakes locked up bringing me to a stop (trailer brake on dash has been set on 0 since they haven't worked since purchased ) I had to unhook trailer wiring to make it home. As I took off I lost communication to transmission again and trailer brake system warning chime kept going off repeatedly, lost dash gauges, causing transmission to get hot. As it was stuck in a certain gear. Your defective wiring/ electrical system has fault and potentially caused a SERIOUS accident, and is going to cost me an enormous amount of money to fix. Also the torque converter has been acting up for a year, forcing me to purchase a tuner just to stretch the life of transmission. This vehicle is NOT safe to drive on highway! This vehicle is life threatening. Putting my life, my familys life and innocent peoples life's in danger! Problem needs resolved or reimbursement/ new truck. A $37,000 truck should not be life-threatening. This truck has spent more time in a garage than on the highway. Solutions have to be done.

        "summary": "I purchased a certified pre-owned 2017 Chevy Silverado on February 1st of this year, and over the last 4 months have put only 5,000 miles on it.  On June 20th, on my way back from a 10-hour trip, where I was towing a trailer with a car on it, my trailer brakes suddenly stopped functioning (about 4 hours from home).  Not only did the trailer brakes stop functioning, but a warning message popped up on the dashboard \"service trailer brake system\".  But this warning message didn't pop up just one time, it kept coming again and again and again and again and again, relentlessly chiming and distracting me from driving, it covered my speedometer readout, it prevented me from receiving or making voice commands, prevented me from hearing phone calls, and prevented me from listening to music. The service warning chime also prevented the turn signal chime from functioning.  So for a full 4 hours, I was constantly reminded with a service trailer brake system chime, was unable to hear my turn signal chime, was unable to listen to music or make a phone call, and was unable to see the digital readout of my speed.  The vehicle had been rendered completely undrivable, and I absolutely will not hesitate to say that the vehicle was not safe to drive in that condition.  Especially if you consider that I was towing 5,000 lbs with no working trailer brakes.  GM's defective wire harness endangered my life. Consumer stated wire harness has not been replaced and manufacture refused to honor CPO warranty.",

The truck was going 10 mph, and when the driver went to stop, the brake petal pressed to the floor, resulting in a rear end collision with the car in front of it. The driver of the first car appeared uninjured, but filed a claim later that he had ongoing lower back issues. The brake light only went on after the incident. The truck was driven to a local Chevrolet dealer and the brakes were serviced a few days later. The vacuum pump was the reason why the truck did not stop.  It is notated on paperwork and confirmed when speaking to the Service Manager on Friday, November 1st at 4:30 pm. The service manager also reported there was now a recall to fix the problem, so it would be fixed and a new vacuum pump would be put in (Vacuum Pump Replacement Special Coverage N182198000). A claim was filed with GMC to pay for the damage and take over the insurance claim made by the owner of the truck, as well as the car in front of it. GMC came out to the Chevrolet dealer during that time, and GMC reported to the owner that they would not help with fixing the vehicle or the insurance claims. The owner requested the final report three times and there was no response. The truck had been reported to multiple service providers that there were issues with the stopping of the brakes in 2019. It was requested by the owner that the brakes were inspected so that they could be replaced if needed. There was also an incident in July 2019 where front and rear brakes were interchanged on the paperwork and the owner of the truck was told that it was just a paperwork mix up because they \"fixed the brakes that were bad.\"",

HOWEVER, SINCE LATE MAY, THE PROBLEM HAS DEFINITELY WORSENED AND OCCURS NEARLY EVERY TIME BRAKING AT LOW SPEEDS BOTH MOVING FORWARD AND REVERSE. I HAVE NOW SEEN THE WARNING TO SERVICE THE BRAKE ASSIST MESSAGE APPEAR ON MY DASH. ON MAY 28TH, 2020, WHILE BACKING OUR BOAT INTO STORAGE, THIS ISSUE OCCURRED AND NEARLY SENT THE BOAT INTO THE STORAGE ENTRY SIDE WALL AS THERE IS A SLIGHT HILL JUST IN FRONT OF OUR STORAGE. I HAD TO APPLY AS MUCH PRESSURE AS I POSSIBLY COULD TO THE BRAKES TO STOP THE TRUCK AND BOAT BEFORE HITTING THE ENTRY SIDE WALL.  THE ISSUE OCCURRED REPEATEDLY AS I HAD TO MANEUVER THE BOAT BACK AND FORTH MUCH DIFFERENTLY TO ACCOUNT  FOR THE BRAKING ISSUE.

SECOND, WHEN VEHICLE DOES SHIFT INTO A GEAR, THE VEHICLE CAN LURCH FORWARD UNEXPECTEDLY AS IF YOU WERE HIT FROM BEHIND. THERE IS SOMETIMES AN AUDIBLE \"CLANK\" WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURS. THIS ISSUE CAN PREVENT A DRIVER FROM SUCCESSFULLY ENTERING TRAFFIC DUE TO LOSS OF INSTANT POWER TO THE WHEELS.  2) DURING LOW-SPEED ACCELERATION, THE VEHICLE CAN HESITATE BETWEEN THE FIRST THREE GEARS, PROVIDING NO POWER TO THE WHEELS. IT HAS A SIMILAR FEEL TO A TRANSMISSION THAT WAS SLIPPING. THIS CAN CAUSE A DRIVER TO OVER-CORRECT THE DEFICIENCY IN POWER TO THE WHEELS BY APPLYING EXCESSIVE THROTTLE AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  3) WHEN PROCEEDING SLOWLY IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, THE VEHICLE CAN SHIFT UP OR DOWN SUDDENLY, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LURCH FORWARD UNEXPECTEDLY. THERE IS SOMETIMES AN AUDIBLE \"CLANK\" WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURS. THIS CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO STRIKE THE REAR OF ANOTHER VEHICLE, IN TIGHT TRAFFIC, IF THE DRIVER ISN'T PREPARED TO APPLY THE BRAKE WHEN THE EVENT OCCURS.  4) WHEN DRIVING NORMALLY, THE TRANSMISSION MAY HESITATE TO DOWNSHIFT WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS APPLIED AS WOULD BE NECESSARY WHEN TRYING TO PASS A VEHICLE. THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GEAR DEPENDENT. THE LOSS OF INSTANT POWER CAN PREVENT THE DRIVER FROM SUCCESSFULLY OVERTAKING ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE EVENT THEY NEED TO CONDUCT A PASSING MANEUVER.",

THEY CLAIM THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHERE IT'S COMING FROM, BUT SHOULD NOT BE A SAFETY HAZARD. MY QUESTION IS, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS, HOW CAN THEY SAY IT'S NOT A SAFETY HAZARD. I AM SO AFRAID THAT MY TRUCK IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN AND IT'S NOT EVEN TWO YEARS OLD. I HAVE READ THE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE WITH PEOPLE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, SINCE THE 2014 MODEL. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.",

IT TURNS OUT, THIS IS ALL A FARCE.  THE TWO REQUESTS THEY SUBMITTED STATED, \"CUSTOMER HAS BEEN ADVISED TO FILE A CLAIM WITH THEIR INSURANCE AS DAMAGE IS CAUSED DUE TO SAND DAMAGE.  CUSTOMER INSISTS DEALERSHIP SUBMIT A CLAIM TO GM FOR WARRANTY RE-PAINT\".  WHILST I'M PARAPHRASING HERE, I WAS LIVID TO LEARN THIS WAS 'THEIR BEHIND MY BACK KIND OF THING'.
