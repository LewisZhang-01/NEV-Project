WENT TO THE GARAGE AND THE ODOR WAS SO STRONG IN THE GARAGE, IT OVERWHELMED ME.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO KIA AND THEY EXAMINED IT AND SAID IT WAS NORMAL.  NOTIFIED THE 1-800 KIA NUMBER.  I HAD THE LOCAL KIA CHANGE THE FUEL FILTER, IT WAS NOT DUE FOR THAT YET BUT THEY SAID IT MIGHT HELP.  IT HAS TO BE TOXIC TO BE INHALING THAT KIND OF FUME.  HOW CAN ANYONE CONSIDER THIS NORMAL?
