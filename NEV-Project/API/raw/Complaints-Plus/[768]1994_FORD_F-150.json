IT STAYED IN THIS STUCK POSITION WHILE MEANWHILE, TO KEEP THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL, I STOOD ON THE BRAKE TO AVOID ACCELERATING TO TOP SPEED. BY CONSTANT APPLICATION OF THE BRAKE I WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE SPEED AT AROUND 85 MPH, BUT NOT WITHOUT EXTREME EFFORT. MEANWHILE I TRIED PUSHING ALL OF THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCHES, WITH NO EFFECT. I ALSO TRIED PUMPING THE BRAKE IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE CRUISE CONTROL RELEASE SWITCH TO ACTIVATE, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP. I ALSO TRIED SHIFTING TO NEUTRAL BUT THE ENGINE WAS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO REDLINE SO I PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE. I CONTINUED THIS WAY FOR SEVERAL MILES. TRAFFIC WAS LUCKILY LIGHT ENOUGH THAT I WAS ABLE TO AVOID OTHER VEHICLES. I WAS AT THE POINT OF HAVING TO PULL OVER AND SWITCH THE IGNITION OFF WHEN THERE WAS A LOUD \"POPPING\" SOUND FROM UNDER THE DASH (STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER). WHEN THE \"POP\" OCCURRED THE THROTTLE RELEASED AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL IT NORMALLY. BY THEN MY BRAKES WERE SMOKING AND ALMOST ON-FIRE.  THIS OCCURRED TWICE.

THE SECOND TIME WAS MUCH WORSE AND LASTED FOR AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX MILES. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO THE DEALER (LA POINT FORD, SALT LAKE CITY) AFTER IT OCCURRED ON THE 27TH. THE MECHANIC COULD FIND NO PROBLEM WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL TESTS THAT HE RAN. THEY SUGGESTED DISCONNECTING THE CRUISE CONTROL TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WOULD STILL OCCUR, JUST IN CASE IT WAS THE ENGINE COMPUTER RATHER THAN THE CRUISE CONTROL.  HOPEFULLY I WILL SURVIVE THE TEST.

I HAD THE TRUCK PARKED AT HOME FOR APPROX. 2 1/2 HOURS WHEN I HEARD THE ALARM BEEP ONCE SO I PROCEEDED TO THE TRUCK AND NOTICED A HEAVY AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE WHEEL WELL ON THE FRONT LEFT SIDE, AND ALSO THE GRILL AREA. AT THIS POINT I CALLED 911, AND WENT BACK TO THE TRUCK TO TRY TO PULL THE HOOD RELEASE, BUT THERE WERE FLAMES COMING OUT OF THE GRILL AREA. THE FIRE SOON SPREAD THROUGH THE FIRE WALL INTO THE INTERIOR COMPARTMENT, I PROBABLY THREW 20 BUCKETS OF WATER ON THE FIRE PRIOR TO FIRE DEPT. GETTING HERE AND WAS UN-SUCCESSFUL IN PUTTING IT OUT. FORTUNENATLY I DID NOT HAVE THE TRUCK PARKED INSIDE THE ATTACHED GARAGE AT THE TIME. OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS SINCE 1948 AND I AM FAMILIAR WITH STRANGE NOISES, SMELLS, ETC.. THERE WAS NO FUEL LEAKS ON THIS TRUCK, IT WAS SERVICED REGULARLY, AND FOR A 1994 MODEL IT WAS IN EXCELLANT CONDITION, I HAVE MANY RECENT PHOTOS CONFIRMING THE VEHICLE CONDITION. I WANT TO KNOW OF ANY RECALLS THAT THIS TRUCK MAY HAVE HAD OR NOT HAD AND WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING THE EXACT CAUSE OF SUCH A DEVASTATING FIRE. I HAD THIS TRUCK PARKED IN AN ENCLOSED GARAGE FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO, THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL OF FUEL IN THAT GARAGE, THE FIRST SMOKE I SMELLED WAS OF INSULATION BURING OFF OF THE ELECTRICAL WIRING.

THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE BAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY UNLESS ACCIDENT WAS AT 28 MPH AND LIKE HITTING A STONE WALL WITHOUT BREAKING.  MY SON REAR ENDED A NEON HITTING DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE TRUCK BUMPER CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TRUNK OF THE NEON.  THE TRUCK DAMAGE IS THAT THE BUMPER MUST BE REPLACED AS IT BENT AND CRACKED ALONG WITH BENDING THE 1/4\" BRACKESTS THAT ATTACH IT TO THE FRAME.  THE GRILL ALSO NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP COMMENTED THAT IF THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS NOT ON ITS OPERATING CORRECTLY ALONG WITH 28 MPH COMMENT.  WHO'S TO SAY THE BULB IS NOT OUT OR THEY CONNECTED THE WIRES WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE OR IT'S JUST NOT OPERABLE.  BEING A LIFE SAVING DEVISE I'M A BIT SHAKEN BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A GOOD FEELING THAT IT WOULD DEPLOY.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO CLARIFY IF WHAT THE DEALERSHIP SAID IS CORRECT THAT IT WOULD NOT DEPLOY UNLESS ACCIDENT WAS AT OR ABOVE 28 MPH?  THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT GIVE ME THE IMPRESSION THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT EITHER UNLESS OF COURSE I WAS BILLED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER.*AK",

OASIS DID NOT LIST ACTIVE RECALL AGAINST MY VEHICLE.  NO GREEN PAINT ON BUMPER TO INDICATE FACTORY CORRECTION.  VALLEY FORD SERVICE MANAGER (VERY NICE LADY) INFORMED ME THAT VEHICLE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RECALL.  SHE ASKED ME \"WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?\".  I TOLD HER \"NEVER MIND I'LL FIX IT MYSELF\".  CHECKED ON PARTS AVAILABILITY WITH PARTS DEPARTMENT.  PARTS AVAILABLE COST $1.03.  PARTS MAN AND I BOTH COMMENT ON LOW COST.  FORD USUALLY CHARGES AT LEAST $3/BOLT.  MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT OASIS DID NOT LIST THIS VEHICLE IN RECALL EVEN THOUGH THE FAILURE IS EXACTLY AS DETAILED IN THE RECALL. *AK",

ALL THE TREAD COMPLETETLY PEELED OFF THE RIGHT REAR TIRE AND I FISHTAILED DOWN THE INTERSTATE. LUCKLIY NOBODY ELSE WAS ON THE ROAD.

WENT BACK TO FIRESTONE AND COMPLAINED WHY THEY DIDNT TELL ME AND REQUSTED THEY FIX IT.THEY FIRST TOLD ME NOTHING COULD BE DONE WITHOUT THE  DAMAGED TIRE WHICH THEY  SUPPOSSEDLY THREW AWAY.  I CHOOSE NOT TO FIX THE DAMAGE IMMEDIATELY. ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF LATER A LARGE BUBBLE APPEARED ON THE FRONT LEFT TIRE (ONE OF THE THREE PURCHASED WITH THE SECOND SET) WHERE THE TREAD WAS STARTING TO SEPARATE. I TOOK THIS TIRE TO FIRESTONE(SAME PLACE) AND ALSO PAID TO HAVE IT ADJUSTED. AFTER THREATING TO SUE FOR PREVIOUS DAMAGE THEY REFERRED ME TO THE MANUFACTURE IN OHIO (I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN ILLINOIS). I TOOK THAT TIRE HOME. AFTER SEVERAL DISSCUSSIONS WITH THE MANUFACTURE I RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FORM GOT 3 ESTIMATES ON THE PREVIOUS DAMAGE AND SHIPPED THE SECOND TIRE TO THEM.  IN MAY OF 99 THEY PAID AN ADJUSTED CLAIM OF ABOUT $1200.00.  WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF THAT PAYMENT THE THIRD TIRE OF (3) LOST A LARGE PIECE OF  ITS TREAD. LUCKILY IT BROKE OFF AND HIT UNDERNEATH THE CAR AND DIDN'T DO ANY DAMAGE. I PAID TO HAVE THIS TIRE ADJUSTED ALSO. I ALSO STILL HAVE THIS TIRE.
