I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO HAVE MY BROTHER DRIVE CAR TO LOCAL MECHANIC VERY CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY AND IT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A BROKEN LEFT LOWER CONTROL ARM.

ON JANUARY 2ND, 2013 ARUND 4:15 PM I PARKED MY CAR ON THE STREET, IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, FACING UPHILL, LIKE I USUALLY DO. HALF AN HOUR LATER A FRIEND ARRIVED, PARKED HER CAR DOWN THE STREET, FACING DOWNHILL, 100 FEET AWAY FROM MY CAR, SAME SIDE OF THE STREET. AT THAT TIME SHE REMEMBERS SHE SAW MY CAR IN THE SAME SPOT I INITIALLY PARKED IT. AN HOUR LATER, AS MY FRIEND WAS GETTING READY TO LEAVE, MY HUSBAND LOOKED OVER THE WINDOW AND SAW MY CAR AROUND 50 FEET DOWN THE ROAD FROM MY USUAL PARKING SPOT. HE INITIALLY THOUGH THAT THE PARKING SPACE WAS OCCUPIED WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, SO HE HANDED ME THE CAR KEYS SO I CAN BRING THE CAR IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. WHEN I WALKED WITH MY FRIEND TOWARDS HER CAR, WE SAW THAT MY CAR HAS SLID DOWN THE ROAD AROUND 50 FEET, PROBABLY PUSHING MY FRIEND'S CAR AROUND 10 FEET AWAY FROM HER INITIAL PARKING LOCATION. THE FRONT BUMPER OF MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE SCRATCHES, SO IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT MY CAR HAS BEEN PUSHED BY ANOTHER CAR. AS A RESULT OF THE COLLISION THE HYUNDAI ELANTRA HAS A COMPLETELY DAMAGED REAR BUMPER, WITH CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE TRUNK ALSO. MY FRIENDS CAR (A LEXUS RX, 2012) HAS THE REAR BUMPER DAMAGED.    WE BELIEVE THIS INCIDENT WAS DUE TO FAULTY TRANSMISSION ON THE HYUNDAI ELANTRA. IN PAST, WE HAD SEVERAL INCIDENTS .  AT THIS POINT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY CAR. I DRIVE MY DAUGHTER IN THAT CAR, AND IF THE CAR DECIDES TO SLIDE DOWN THE ROAD ON ITS OWN, THIS PUTS MY BABY'S LIFE IN DANGER.

THIS SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED THREE DAYS AND 26 MILES DRIVEN AFTER THE INITIAL REPAIR BY THE DEALERSHIP.  IN THIS CASE, I WAS IDLING IN THE LEFT HAND TURNING LANE OF A 6 LANE DIVIDED HIGHWAY, WAITING IN A LINE OF CARS FOR A LEFT-TURN GREEN ARROW.  THE STEERING WHEEL TWITCHED, TRIED TO ROTATE REALLY, IN MY HANDS, THEN FELT LOCKED.  I LOOKED AT THE DASHBOARD AND THE RED EPS LIGHT WAS ON. I HAD RESEARCHED HYUNDAI EPS LIGHT PROBLEMS ON THE INTERNET SINCE MY FIRST INCIDENT, AND SOME POSTERS RECOMMENDED TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING THE CAR TO ACTIVATE THE STEERING AGAIN.  I TRIED THIS AND THE EPS LIGHT DID GO OUT WHEN THE CAR RESTARTED, AND THE FEELING OF STEERING WHEEL CONTROL RETURNED.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE OFF THE HIGHWAY BUT GOT NO MORE THAN 1/4 MILE TOTAL BEFORE THE STEERING LOCKED AGAIN AND THE EPS LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN.  I DRIFTED TO THE CURB AND RESTARTED THE CAR AGAIN.  THE STEERING CAME BACK ON AGAIN, AND I PROCEEDED ABOUT ANOTHER 1/4 MILE AT SLOW SPEED BEFORE THE STEERING LOCKED AGAIN AND THE EPS LIGHT REAPPEARED.  I RESTARTED THE CAR AGAIN AND THIS TIME WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE LAST BLOCK TO MY HOME AND PULLED TO THE CURB.  WHILE IDLING THERE, THE EPS LIGHT CAME ON AND THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED AGAIN.  I CALLED THE DEALER FOR ASSISTANCE, AND THEY RETURNED MY CALL AND TOLD ME TO CALL HYUNDAI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FOR A TOW.  THE DEALERSHIP KEPT THE CAR SEVERAL DAYS AS THEY NEEDED TO ORDER A PART.  THE WORK ORDER STATES '13090 SOP PART, REPLACE STEERING COLUMN, PART # 56310-2H300, SHAFT C1290 TORQUE SENSOR ABD'. IN ONE MONTH OF DRIVING SINCE THIS REPAIR, I HAVE HAD NO RED EPS LIGHTS, NO STEERING FAILURE.  HOWEVER, THE STEERING WHEEL DOES CONTINUE TO TWITCH ON ITS OWN, SOMETIMES WHILE IDLING, SOMETIMES WHILE MOVING. I FEEL THE DEALERSHIP HAS TREATED ME FAIRLY, BUT I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DEFECT. *TR",

WHILE MOVING AT THE SPEED LIMIT, THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP.  MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS THAT THE CAR HAD SOMEHOW STALLED.  I RAPIDLY PUMPED THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN AND WARN OTHER CARS.

IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PURPOSE OF AN ABS IS TO PREVENT LOSS OF TRACTION AND STEERING CONTROL DURING AN EMERGENCY BRAKING SITUATION.  DURING A RECENT ROUND OF WINTER SNOW, I FOUND THAT THE SYSTEM DID NOT SHORTEN MY STOPPING DISTANCE AND DID NOT PREVENT THE FRONT WHEELS FROM LOSING THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR ON SNOW.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO EXIT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 465 AT A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH, I WAS UNABLE TO DECELERATE SUFFICIENTLY IN THE LENGTH OF THE DECELERATION LANE TO MAKE THE CURVE OF THE CLOVERLEAF AND LOST THE ABILITY TO STEER THE VEHICLE WHILE THE ABS WAS ACTIVATED.  I DID SOME EXPERIMENTING AND FOUND THAT I COULD STOP IN A SHORTER DISTANCE WITH MORE CONTROL, IF I SHIFTED THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL WHEN TRYING TO STOP.  I ALSO FOUND THAT I COULD SLOW THE VEHICLE BETTER AND NOT LOSE STEERING CONTROL IF I DOWNSHIFTED INTO A LOWER GEAR, THAN I COULD USING THE BRAKES.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER NEAR MY HOME AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ABS.  THEY DROVE THE CAR AND TOLD ME THAT NO REPAIRS WERE NEEDED AND THAT THE ABS PERFORMED SIMILARLY TO OTHER HYUNDAI VEHICLES.   WHEN I ADVISED THEM THAT THE ABS DID NOT ALLOW ME TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, THE SERVICE TECH AGREED, BUT STATED THE VEHICLE WAS PREFORMING AS DESIGNED.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHEN HE RETURNED FROM VACATION TODAY AND HE AGREED THAT THE ABS DID NOT WORK LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT THAT REPLACING PARTS WOULD NOT RESOLVE MY CONCERNS WITH THE ABS.

I CALLED THEIR CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPT. AND WAS TOLD THAT THE SERVICE DEPT. HAD FAILED TO PERFORM ONE OF SEVERAL TESTS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  THEY WERE TO CALL ME WITHIN 1-3 DAYS.  IT IS DAY 2 NOW AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.  I DO NOT TRUST HYUNDAI AND WANT TO GET RID OF THE CAR.  I HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED A \"CONSUMER REP\" WHO WILL NOW BE THE ONLY PERSON I WILL BE ALLOWED TO TALK TO REGARDING THE CAR.  IF THE ENGINE SHUT-DOWN HAD OCCURRED ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC THROUGH WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO GO, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I AM NOT WILLING TO DRIVE A CAR THAT IS DANGEROUS.  CAN I BELIEVE HYUNDAI WHEN/IF THEY TELL ME MY CAR HAS BEEN FIXED?????  I DOUBT IT! *TR",

ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO, I WENT TO STOP AT A RED LIGHT, AND INSTEAD OF STOPPING, MY CAR MADE A GRINDING SOUND FOR 4-6 SECONDS (LIKE MY ABS BRAKES WERE TURNING ON, BUT LONGER) AND DIDN?T STOP UNTIL IT HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME (ROADS WERE DRY & MY CAR WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 10 MPH). DUE TO THE LOW SPEED, MY CAR ONLY BUMPED THE CAR IN FRONT AND ONLY BUMPERS WERE DAMAGED. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM CHECK MY BRAKES. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULDN?T FIND ANYTHING.     TWO WEEKS LATER, I?M DRIVING AND GO TO STOP AT A RED LIGHT (DIFFERENT LIGHT, ROADS WERE DRY, GOING MAYBE 10-15 MPH) AND MY CAR AGAIN MAKES THE SAME GRINDING SOUND FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS BEFORE I TRIED TO PUMP THE BRAKES. AFTER I PRESSED AND RELEASED THE BRAKES, THE GRINDING SOUND STOPPED AND THE CAR STOPPED. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED. THEY LOOKED IT OVER, SAW NO COMPUTER READ OUT, AND TOLD ME THEY DIDN?T THINK THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND UNLESS THEY COULD DUPLICATE IT, THEY COULDN?T FIX IT. I WAS TOLD TO COME BACK IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN (AT WHICH POINT THEY COULD TAKE MY CAR FOR 2-3 WEEKS TO TEST IT AND SEE IF THEY COULD FIND THE PROBLEM. (I ASKED, THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE A LOANER!)   THE PROBLEM HAS SINCE HAPPENED TWICE MORE (ONCE IN THE RAIN, ONCE ON DRY ROADS, & ALWAYS WHEN I TRY TO STOP WHILE TRAVELING 15MPH OR LESS). I DID RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT APPARENTLY IT IS LIKELY DUE TO A DEFECTIVE ABS MODULE (QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH THE YEARS AND MAKES DIFFER) AND ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE THAT HYUNDAI REFUSES TO ADMIT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE MODULE, BUT THEY WILL REPLACE IT FOR ABOUT $1500+LABOR. I LIVE BY NUMEROUS SCHOOLS, SO I CAN?T RISK HAVING A CAR THAT WON?T STOP (TOO MANY SMALL CHILDREN THAT LIKE TO RUN IN FRONT OF CARS), & HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY TO FIX IT OR GET A NEW CAR, BUT THEY SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED BECAUSE THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK. *TR",

DROPPED IT OFF TO DEALERSHIP WHERE PURCHASED 8/10/08.  NEXT DAY, INFORMED OF BROKEN FUEL PUMP.  BEING REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE - READY TODAY,  8/14/08.  AFTER READING SO MANY SIMILAR STORIES ON-LINE, I FELT I HAD TO INFORM YOU OF MY INCIDENT.  I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL - ESPECIALLY AS THERE ARE SO MANY 2008 ELANTRAS ON THE ROAD.  HAD WE NEEDED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY ESCAPE OF OUR STALLED CAR, IN NY TRAFFIC, WE WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN KILLED TRYING TO EXIT, AND PROBABLY BEEN RUN OVER BY A TRACTOR TRAILER HAD WE STAYED IN THE CAR.  WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUR CRATED PUPPY OUT OF THE BACK SEAT, AS A PARENT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RESCUE A BABY IN AN INFANT SEAT.  THIS IS A SERIES OF TRAGEDIES WAITING TO HAPPEN!!!!  I WILL STILL NOT FEEL CONFIDENT DRIVING MY 3 1/2 MONTH OLD CAR, AS MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE TROUBLE EVEN WITH REPLACED PARTS.  I IMPLORE YOU TO PROBE DEEPER IN TO THIS MATTER AND HAVE HYUNDAI CORRECT THIS PROBLEM...BEFORE MANY PEOPLE BECOME A FATALITY STATISTIC!  *TR",

ABOUT AN HOUR INTO MY TRIP, THE CAR STARTED SHUDDERING AND SHAKING ON INTERSTATE 84. I PULLED OFF AT THE NEAREST EXIT, AND THE CAR DIED COMPLETELY.

ON JUNE 6TH THE VEHICLE BROKE DOWN IN TRAFFIC. IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. THEY REPAIRED A PVC HOSE THAT HAD COLLAPSED. AFTER PICKING UP THE VEHICLE THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE  SAME EVENT OCCURRED, STRANDING US IN THE MIDDLE OF A DIVIDED, HEAVILY TRAVELED, ROAD. THE VEHICLE WAS AGAIN TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS. THIS TIME THE FUEL PUMP WAS REPLACED. AFTER WAITING FIVE DAYS FOR THE PART TO BE DELIVERED, I PICKED UP THE CAR ONCE AGAIN. MY WIFE HAD EARLIER NOTICED A VERY STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE AFTER WE BROUGHT IT HOME. ON JUNE 19TH I WAS OUT RUNNING ERRANDS WITH MY CHILDREN. THE VEHICLE, AGAIN SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I AGAIN HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED  TO THE DEALER.  THE SERVICE MANAGER THEN INFORMED ME HE HAD JUST FOUND OUT  HYUNDAI WAS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL SYSTEMS ON THEIR 2008 ELANTRA MODELS. I THEN CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE TO FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE VEHICLE. I ALSO ASK THE REPRESENTATIVE TO CHECK ON ANY RECALLS OR CAMPAIGNS AGAINST MY VEHICLE. AFTER CHECKING HIS SYSTEM HE INFORMED ME THAT THERE WERE NO CAMPAIGNS OR RECALLS REGISTERED AGAINST THE CAR. SO FAR THIS DANGEROUS EVENT HAS OCCURRED THREE TIMES IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY WHEN WE USE THIS VEHICLE. SO FAR THE COLLAPSED  PVC HOSE AND FUEL PUMP HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITHOUT CORRECTING THE PROBLEM. I JUST RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NO GASOLINE IN IT. I EXPLAINED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT WHEN THE VEHICLE SHUTDOWN, THE VEHICLE WAS REGISTERING 3/4 TANK. NOW THEY ARE CHECKING OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THEY ARE UNABLE DETERMINE THE DEFECT WITH THE VEHICLE. I AM ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IF I HAVE TO USE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN IT WILL SHUTDOWN AGAIN AND I OR A FAMILY MEMBER  MAY BE INJURED.  *TR",
