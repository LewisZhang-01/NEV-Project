Yesterday, I was entering an entrance ramp onto the freeway and my car loss power, and the only time I was happy to have the police behind me because they blocked traffic so I would not get hit while trying to restart my car. The first time this occurred was April 2019 when my car lost power while I was driving on a high rise bridge during a storm causing the car to hydroplane back and forth against the railing. I was able to restart it and turn the hazard lights on so I would not get hit. But this accident injured me causing me to undergo months of medical treatment. Even after telling the insurance company about the power loss during the accident and even after the car was repaired from the accident then returned to me, it still was losing power. They took my car back and told me after inspecting it again, it was the battery and they replaced it. This was never taken serious when I was injured and could have died that day and many other days since. They did not check to see if it could have been a recall issue. Now I am experiencing this problem multiple times a week, and unless this is done by the manufacturer, it will not be corrected, putting us all in danger or leaving me without transportation because I have no faith I will be safe to continue to drive this car that I still have a year and a half of payments left.

In addition, the transmission is very jerky & the engine does not run smoothly once it restarts. That also happens occasionally upon the first start of the day.

When the engine stalls, power steering and braking are also lost. My car has stalled several times in the middle of intersections, on a busy highway coming to a red light or slowing down because of a hazard in front of me, and at stop signs.  I also check my oil regularly, and do routine oil changes. When I check the oil, and when I have my oil changed, the oil level is almost ALWAYS low, and has even been completely empty a couple times. I've confirmed that there is no leaking under the car. Sometimes I smell burnt oil coming from my car. I fill the oil up, and less than a month, and the oil is almost gone. More worrisome to me, is the fact that even though the oil was completely empty, my oil light never came on. So it was by luck that I checked the oil and noticed that it was empty because I wouldn't have otherwise known.

AFTER TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALER A FEW WEEKS LATER, THEY SAID THE SAME THING, THAT IT WAS A \"LEFT FOOT SHIFT\" (WHATEVER THAT IS) AND STILL LEARNING HOW I DRIVE BUT THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID A TCM AND PCM UPDATE. THIS DID NOT HELP. IT HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED ODD SHIFTING PROBLEMS WHEN IN SPORT MODE USING THE PADDLE SHIFTERS. WHEN YOU ARE IN 3RD AND GO TO UPSHIFT INTO 4TH, IT DOWN SHIFTS INTO 2ND! SEVERAL TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED ON CURVERY ROADS WHERE A DOWNSHIFT AT THAT SPEED COULD THROW YOU OFF. FAST FORWARD A YEAR LATER ALL THE WHILE IT IS STILL SHIFTING HARD AND HAVING ISSUES WITH THE PADDLE SHIFT MODE, I AM NOW GETTING A \"SERVICE PARKING BRAKE\" AND \"SERVICE TRANSMISSION\" CODE IN THE DASH IN ADDITION TO THE ENGINE LIGHT POPPING UP AND THE CAR NOT GOING INTO GEAR VIA THE ELECTRONIC SHIFT KNOB. THIS ISSUE HAS LEFT ME STRANDED FROM TIMES RANGING FROM 30 MINUTES TO 1 HOUR. WHILE A CASE IS STILL ONGOING WITH CHRYSLER, I HAVE SOME OTHER INFORMATION TO BE NOTED. THIS CAR WAS A PART OF THE RECALL R08 (TRANSAXLE PARK ROD), R24 (POWER DISTRIBUTION CENTER ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR), AND S55 (TRANSAXLE RANGE SENSOR WIRE HARNESS), WHICH WERE ALL REPAIRED. I AM NOW A YEAR OUT OF POWERTRAIN WARRANTY WITH THIS 2015 CHRYSLER 200S THAT HAS 96,500 MILES ON IT. HOWEVER, I HAVE PAPERWORK (WHICH CAN BE PROVIDED) THAT I TRIED TO HAVE THIS CAR FIXED BEFORE THE POWERTRAIN WAS UP BUT INSTEAD I WAS SENT ON MY WAY. AFTER TAKING IT TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS, IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT IT HAS A \"CLUTCH PACK FAILURE\" WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN ENTIRELY NEW TRANSMISSION.

I SCHEDULED TO TAKE IT IN THE FOLLOWING MORNING. THE MECHANIC LOOKED AT IT AND ASKED ME IF I HAD CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION. NO SAME TRANSMISSION AS WAS IN IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT. THEY TRIED TELLING ME THAT THE SOFTWARE DID NOT MATCH THE TRANSMISSION AND NEEDED A SOFTWARE UPDATE, WHICH THEY DID AND ALLEGEDLY RETESTED IT. EVERYTHING FINE NOW THEY SAID. YESTERDAY, JUNE 9, 2020, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND THE CAR STARTED DINGING AT ME. THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON AND DASH NOTIFICATION TO SERVICE TRANSMISSION. THE CAR STARTING LOSING POWER AND DID NOT WANT TO MOVE WITH THE TRANSMISSION WANTING TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL. CAME TO STOP LIGHT AND CAR DID NOT WANT TO MOVE. I HAD CARS BEHIND ME THAT ALMOST HIT ME BECAUSE MY CAR SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL. IT STARTED MOVING THEN SHIFTED FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL.

I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET BLOCKING AN ONCOMING CAR. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT REGISTER NEUTRAL AND IT ROLLED BACK SO THE CAR COULD GET PAST ME. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON IT FINALLY REGISTERED REVERSE AND I GOT IT IN THE DRIVEWAY. CALL DEALERSHIP TO TELL THEM. THEY SAY NO RECALL, NOTHING WRONG. SERIOUSLY???

I HAVEN'T TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE BECAUSE I WAS TRIED OF THE RUN AROUND AND THEM SAYING IT'S NOTHING WRONG. MY CAR DOES THIS FREQUENTLY MAINLY ON THE HIGHWAY WHERE IT'S UNSAFE TO BE DOING SO. I'VE EVEN HAD PROBLEMS WHERE THE CAR DOESN'T START UP TILL THE NEXT DAY. I HAD PROBLEMS WHERE THE WHEN IT'S TIME FOR AN OIL CHANGE THAT IT EVENTUALLY SHUTDOWNS DOWN. TODAY MAY 22, 2020 IS THE LATEST WHERE ONCE AGAIN THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE.  *TR",

I NOW HAVE THE CAR TODAY & SO FAR ALL IS GOOD. HOWEVER I AM UPSET NO ONE TOLD ME THIS CAR HAD 8 RECALLS. BEFORE SELLING IT TO ME & I'M A NEW DRIVER! THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE & I FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT RECALLED & REPLACE THIS WITH A NEW VEHICLE COMPLETELY.

I LOVED MY CHRYSLER AND I'M VERY SAD THAT I NOW HAVE TO LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT CAR SINCE I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CHRYSLER 200, THINGS LIKE THIS MAKES THE VEHICLE SEEM VERY UNRELIABLE AND UNSAFE.",

THE TROUBLE-CODE WAS: B0020-13. HE CALLED TO GET THE REQUIRED PARTS, AND WAS QUOTED $1,074.00 PLUS 7% TAX AND LABOR OF $100.00. HE LOOKED ON COMPUTER AND FOUND THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE SEAT-SENSOR-HARNESS SHOULD BE CALIBRATED TOGETHER. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PRICE DOUBLES TO $2.500.00 FOR BOTH SEAT-SENSOR-HARNASSES! IT IS A \"SAFETY ISSUE\" THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN A CAR THAT IS ONLY 5 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS OLD (THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE IS APRIL 2015). WE LOOKED-UP THE PROBLEM ONLINE AND FOUND   RECALL # 16V114000 WHICH STATES THAT IF ONE SEAT HARNESS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, THEN, BOTH MUST BE REPLACED AND CALIBRATED AS A SINGLE UNIT, THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST!  I CALLED CHRYSLER AT 1-800-853-1403 WITH MY VIN NUMBER AND SHE SAID THAT MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED (ACTUALLY, THE RECALL ONLY APPLIES TO ONLY 78 VEHICLES). BUT AFTER TELLING HER THAT IT WAS A \"SAFETY ISSUE\" THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR, SHE GAVE ME A \"GOODWILL ASSISTANCE CASE NUMBER\". I WAS TOLD THAT THEY \"MIGHT\" HELP; AND TO CALL MY CHRYSLER DEALER AND GIVE THAT NUMBER TO THEM. I DID SO AND THEY SAID THEY WILL CALL ME 'SOON'.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.. THEY DON'T LIKE TO TELL YOU MUCH; BUT I'M HOPING TO HAVE IT FIXED QUICKLY, IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH THAT MIGHT DISABLE, OR KILL, ME!   THANK YOU!",

SINCE ABOUT A MONTH AFTER I HAD FINANCED THE CAR I NOTICED THAT THE AIR BAG LIGHT WAS ON AND THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT WOULD POP ON AND OFF. THE CAR STARTED TO STAY AT A CERTAIN SPEED LIMIT AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE NO MATTER HOW HARD OR LONG I PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDAL. I WOULD THEN HAVE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN MY CAR OFF AND THEN TURN IT BACK ON. THIS WAS ONGOING FOR MONTHS.. IT WAS MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION TO WORK AND I DIDN?T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET A NEW CAR AFTER JUST FINANCING ONE AND BEING YOUNG IN THE MILITARY. I HAD TOOK IT TO MY DEALERSHIP WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT WOULD COME UP BECAUSE THE SENSOR FOR MY OIL WASN'T READING AND IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AND MY AIR BAG LIGHT CAME UP BECAUSE SOMEONE IN THE BACKSEAT MUST'VE STEPPED ON IT AND IT WOULD STILL WORK BUT THE LIGHT WOULD BE THERE. A LOT OF [XXX] BUT AT THE TIME I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH SO I WENT OFF OF WHAT THEY SAID. LATER ON THE LIGHT WOULD GO ON AND OFF. FOR THE FIRST 6 MONTH I BELIEVE I HAD REPLACED MY LIGHTS 8 TIMES THINKING THAT IT WAS NORMAL TO CHANGE IT THAT OFTEN. AGAIN I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS. BUT AFTER GETTING IT CHECKED THE DEALERSHIP HAD TOLD ME I HAVE WIRING ISSUES AND I MY HEAD LIGHTS AND HIGHBEAMS DON?T WORK ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. AND AFTER LETTING A FRIEND USE MY CAR FOR A DAY I BELIEVE THEY'VE GONE OUT COMPLETELY.

HE STARTED THE CAR AND THE TRANSMISSION MESSAGE WAS GONE BUT THE MIL LIGHT WAS STILL ON. HE PLACED THE CAR IN DRIVE AND MOVED IT  FORWARD AND THEN IN REVERSE TO BACK IT UP.  THE LIGHT WAS STILL ON BUT HE TOLD ME THAT BASED ON THAT THE TRANSMISSION DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY ISSUES.  THE NEXT MORNING ON 04/21/2018 , I TRIED TO AUTO START MY CAR, GOT IN THE CAR AND ON THE DASH READ DISABLED SO THE CAR DIDN'T AUTO START.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THAT OTHER THAN WHEN THE CAR IS LOW ON FUEL YOU CAN'T AUTO START THE CAR AND MY CAR HAD A FULL TANK OF GAS WHEN I TRIED STARTING IT THIS MORNING.  SO WHEN I STARTED THE CAR MANUALLY IT NO LONGER SHOWED THE MIL LIGHT AND WHILE DRIVING ON THE STREET AND FREEWAY BACK HOME IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVING AND SHIFTING FINE.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY CAR ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WHILE DRIVING HAS A DELAYED TIME WHEN SHIFTING TO PICK UP SPEED AND THIS IS AFTER THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR A WHILE AND I'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR SOME DISTANCE. THEN ONCE IT SHIFTS IT GIVES A JERK THEN IT PICKS UP SPEED.",

ENTERPRISE HAS YET TO HELP ME OR GET BACK TO ME ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES. IT WAS A RENTAL CAR BEFORE I BOUGHT IT FROM THEM, OBVIOUSLY THEY SOLD ME A LEMON! AS I WAS GETTING AN OIL CHANGE ON 11/01/17 I HAD THEM RUN CODES AND IT AND IT READ I NEEDED A NEW THERMOSTAT TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENGINE OVERHEATING AND THE ETC LIGHT...NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS HAS BEEN A CAR FROM HELL. I HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS TO ENTERPRISE ABOUT THIS CAR REPEATEDLY ESPECIALLY WITH IT ALL HAPPENING SO SOON AFTER GETTING THE CAR. I'M STUCK WITH IT NOW SO I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEBODY TO KNOW WHAT THERE DOING AND ACTUALLY FIX THIS CAR!!!",

THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED FROM 67 MPH TO 70 MPH THEN TO 74 MPH WITHIN A FEW SECONDS.  I CANCELLED CRUISE CONTROL BUT THE CAR STAYED AT THE ACCELERATED SPEED AND I HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE CAR AT THAT TIME. I TAPPED THE BRAKE WITH NO RESPONSE; THEN I TAPPED THE ACCELERATOR AND FINALLY REGAINED CONTROL AND WAS THEN ABLE TO BRAKE AND SLOW THE CAR DOWN. WHEN THE CAR WAS ACCELERATED TO 74 MPH, I HAD NO CONTROL AND I COULD HEAR THAT IT WAS WINDING AND TRYING TO SHIFT TO THE NEXT GEAR BUT IT SEEMED STUCK AT 4000 RPMS. THIS WAS A VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE.  I WILL NOT ALLOW MY DAUGHTER TO DRIVE THE CAR ANYMORE. I ALSO AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT MYSELF.  IT'S A FAIRLY NEW CAR AND I HAVE ALREADY GONE TO THE DEALERSHIP 2 TIMES PRIOR TO THIS EVENT BECAUSE THE CAR ALSO SUDDENLY ACCELERATES WHEN I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR ATTEMPTING TO BRAKE.  ON A DAILY BASIS, I CAN FEEL THE CAR SPEED UP WHEN I TAKE MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO THE BRAKE. THIS SUDDEN SURGE COULD EASILY CAUSE A FENDER BENDER.  EACH TIME I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THIS ISSUE, THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. WHEN I CALLED CHRYSLER ABOUT THIS EVENT ON 1 MAY, I WAS OFFERED ASSISTANCE IN GETTING IT DIAGNOSED AGAIN, BUT I HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT AND SEE NO NEED SINCE ON BOTH OCCASIONS THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I HOPE THEY BUY THIS CAR BACK AS I DON'T FEEL IT'S SAFE TO TRADE IN PLUS I AM \"UPSIDE DOWN\" SO I WOULD STILL BE PAYING FOR IT EVEN IF I TRADED IT.

IN VERY SLOW TRAFFIC (5-7 MILES/HOUR) WHEN I TRIED TO COME HOME AFTER WORK MEETING FROM KIRKLAND SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT MY BRAKES DON'T WANNA STOP THE CAR WITH LIGHT TAPPING AS IT WAS OK PREVIOUSLY, THEN TAPPED ON BRAKE HARDER AND THEN PANIC AND REALIZED THE BRAKE. I END UP WITH HANG ON THE TAIL (THE LITTLE THING ATTACHED TO THE REAR END OF THE CAR) OF BIG TRACK. I TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BRAKES PROBLEM TO MY INSURANCE, BUT COLLISION REPAIR COMPANY DID NOT CONFIRM MY CONCERNS AND I PAID $1000 DEDUCTIBLE AS THE DRIVER IN FAULT (IN THE FUTURE IT WILL AFFECT MY MONTHLY PAY FOR INSURANCE). I TRIED TO FIND THE SOLUTION BUT ONLY MY FAMILY CAN SUPPORT ME WITHOUT LAUGHING AT MY PROBLEM WITH THE CAR SAFETY. ONE OF MY FRIENDS TOLD ME, THAT I NEED TO INVOLVE SOME OF AN INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL AND STOP TRYING TALK TO THE WALL. CHRYSLER ALREADY TOOK AN ADVANTAGE OF MY NOT FAIR PURCHASE AND THEN MY TRADE-IN WITH THEM (MY DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO REPLACE MY PREVIOUS CHRYSLER 200 FOR SAFETY REASON AGAIN!!! AND SOLD TO ME MY CURRENT CHRYSLER FOR $43,000 AND IT'S NOT SAFE STILL!!!). IN ADDITIONAL, I SCARED WITH THE NOISE PRODUCING BY THE CAR WHILE I'M DRIVING:  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF NOISE FROM THE ENGINE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN OF THE HILL AND WINDOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE WINDOWS SHAKING NOISE. FRANKLY SAYING, I HAVE VERY UPSETTING EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND START LOOKING FOR THE SECOND OPINION WITH TREATING ME AS THE FAIR AND PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT IS IN THE OPTIONS TO KEEP MY LIFE SAFE SINCE I HAVE A STRONG FEELING, THAT  I'M NOT SAFE TO DRIVE MY CHRYSLER. THANK YOU!   *TR",

THIS RECALL IDENTIFIED A LOSS OF MOTIVE POWER THAT COULD OCCUR DUE TO A FAULTY TRANSAXLE WIRE HARNESS, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN A CRASH. SOLUTION WAS TO REPLACE THE WIRE HARNESS WHEN PARTS BECAME AVAILABLE. AFTER A TWO MONTH WAIT, FCA CHANGED THE SUGGESTED REPAIR FROM REPLACING THE WIRE HARNESS TO RE-PROGRAMMING THE PCM AND TCM. THIS RE-PROGRAMMING, PREVENTS THE TRANSMISSION FROM SHIFTING TO NEUTRAL, CAUSING  A LOSS OF MOTIVE POWER, BUT WILL NOW PLACE THE VEHICLE IN \"LIMP MODE\". DEALER SERVICE MANAGERS COULD NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THAT PROCESS. WE KNOW IT WILL CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION TO DOWNSHIFT, EITHER TO THIRD OR MAYBE SECOND GEAR, NOT SURE WHICH, AND A REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM SPEED TO 30 MPH OR LESS, AGAIN NOT SURE WHAT IT WILL BE. THE ROOT CAUSE, THE TRANSAXLE WIRE HARNESS WILL NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCES THIS PROBLEM. SO, I AM LEFT WITH THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WHICH COULD FAIL AT ANY TIME. WHETHER THE VEHICLE LOSES ALL MOTIVE POWER, OR ABRUPTLY DOWNSHIFTS TO A LOWER GEAR WITH A LOSS OF ACCELERATION WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS COULD STILL PRODUCE A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION IF A PERSON REACTS INCORRECTLY. ARE THESE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, WHICH ARE NOT THOSE IDENTIFIED IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL, APPROVED BY THE NHTSA, OR CAN THE MANUFACTURER CHANGE THEM AT WILL? I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS. FIVE OF THOSE THE VEHICLE REMAINED PARKED IN THE GARAGE DUE TO TWO RECALLS. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN.",

AN HOUR INTO DRIVING AFTER I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP THE CAR STALLED AGAIN THIS TIME IT WAS DARK OUT AND I WAS ON A HIGHWAY (LUCKILY RIGHT LANE) THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN BACK ON THIS TIME IT WAS COMPLETELY LOCKED. I EXITED THE VEHICLE AND SAT ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK. (POLICE WERE CALLED TOO). THIS PROBLEM WAS BLAMED ON THE R24 RECALL, A MONTH LATER I GOT THE CAR BACK WITH THE PART THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED AND EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE. THE CAR STALLED AGAIN ON 4/20/2016, SAME MESSAGE ON DASHBOARD THIS TIME IT WAS WHILE MOVING AND MAKING A TURN AND I ALMOST GOT HIT HEAD ON BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. THEY TOOK THE CAR IN AGAIN, SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG THIS TIME, HAPPENED AGAIN IN JUNE,2016 THEY SAID AGAIN NOTHING WAS WRONG. IT HAPPENED AGAIN, THE END OF SEPT,2016 AND I GOT A RECALL NOTICE FOR THE S55 RECALL WHICH CAN CAUSE STALLING. THEY KEPT THE CAR IN DEALERSHIP SAID THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR PART FROM CHRYSLER. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS FIXED AND ON 11/6/2016 I PICKED UP THE CAR AND IT STALLED ABOUT 100FT AWAY FROM THE DEALERSHIP.

I REQUESTED ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO OTHER DEPARTMENT. I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR AND WAS FLATLY DENIED BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHO HAD A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. I HAVEN'T EVER DEALT WITH A CSR THAT HOSTILE. I'M SURPRISED SHE WORKS WITH CUSTOMERS. I'VE ONLY HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS AND IT'S BEEN A NIGHTMARE. DEFINITELY BUYERS REMORSE HERE. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR AT ALL. CHRYSLER HAS HAD MORE THAN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO EITHER REPAIR OR REFUND THIS VEHICLE. I BELIEVE  THEY SHOULD REPURCHASE IT FROM ME SO I CAN INVEST IN SOMETHING ELSE.  AND AS A SIDE NOTE: I HAVE MANAGED TO TRACK DOWN ALL OF HE WORK ORDERS COMPLETED ON THIS CAR EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST SAFETY RECALL, AND ACCORDING TO CHRYSLER'S RECORDS, IT WAS REPAIRED BY A RENTAL COMPANY WHO IS NOW DEFUND.

I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO GAS STATION AND TRIED TO PLACE INTO PARK, DASH THEN TOLD ME NOT ABLE TO PLACE INTO PARK, THUS I FORCED IT TO TURN OFF.  I RETURNED TO THE CAR 20 MINUTES LATER AND IT STARTED BACK UP WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STILL ON AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THEN CLEARED ITSELF AND TOOK TO DEALER 2 DAYS LATER, THEY STATED NOTHING WAS WRONG W/ IT BUT MAYBE THE WIRING RECALL WOULD FIX IT BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND A STORED CODE THAT SAID IT WAS A COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  I BEGAN TO HAVE HARD SHIFTING ISSUES IN MARCH.  I FINALLY HAD TO CONTACT CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CARE AS THE DEALER WOULD NOT TIMELY FIX THE RECALL.  IT WAS THEN FIXED IN MARCH.  THEY DID A LEARN AND PLAY ON THE TRANSMISSION AND IT HAS FIXED THE HARD SHIFTING.  SINCE MARCH, 3 DIFFERENCE OCCASIONS WITH TWO OF THEM IN THE TWO WEEKS AND MULTIPLE TIMES ON EACH OCCASION THE TRANSMISSION SERVICE LIGHT HAS ILLUMINATED, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON, AND THE CAR GO INTO LIMP MODE.  THE LIMP MODE IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT PUTS ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET SOMETIMES AND CANNOT GO ANYWHERE.  I HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF EXIT RAMPS OF HIGHWAYS, I HAVE BEEN LEFT AT LIGHTS, ETC.  EACH TIME WE GO TO THE DEALER AND THEY CANNOT RECREATE THIS (BUT THEY STATE THEY CAN ONLY DRIVE IT A FEW MILES) SO IT NEVER GETS FIXED.  THIS TIME, I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER, CHRYSLER KNOWS OF THE ISSUE AND IT IS A LOW VOLTAGE ISSUE TELLING THE TRANSMISSION TO SHUT DOWN BUT THEY SAID THEY ARE TRYING TO GET IT APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVT AS A RECALL.  I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS OF THIS CAR, I HAVE PAID $32,000 FOR A NEW CAR AND IT LEAVES ME VERY VULNERABLE AND NOT SAFE AT ALL!",

THE RECALL IS FOR THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING THEM FOR A YEAR. AT ONE POINT THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT FIX ANYTHING BECAUSE THEIR TRANSMISSION GUY WAS OUT ON SICK LEAVE. MY CAR HAS BEEN DANGEROUS SINCE I BOUGHT IT. IT HESITATES WHEN STEPPING ON THE ACCELERATOR ON THE HIGHWAY. WHEN THE CAR STARTS OUT, IT LUNGES FORWARD AND FEELS LIKE A BUCKING HORSE. I WAS EMBARRASSED TO PUT PEOPLE IN MY CAR. I WORKED WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT TRANSPORTED CHILDREN AND FELT TERRIFIED TO PLACE A CHILD IN MY CAR. MACK HAIK HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. THEIR SOLUTION FOR MY PROBLEM WAS TO PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR WITH A $200.00 DOLLAR MORE PAYMENT. I'VE BEEN SO FRUSTRATED THAT I CONSIDERED A LEMON LAW ATTORNEY.

MY CONCERN IS THAT THE CAR WAS NEARLY UNDRIVEABLE AS IT WAS; WHAT IF THE PCM HAD SUFFERED A CASCADING DAMAGE OF SOME SORT?  ESPECIALLY, WHAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WHILE I WAS TRAVELING 70MPH ON THE FREEWAY?  I JUST THINK THAT A COMPONENT OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AS THE PCM SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER ONLY 11000 MILES.  I NOW HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE REPLACEMENT:  WILL IT BE BRAND NEW OR REBUILT?  IF REBUILT, HOW RELIABLE WILL THAT END UP BEING? I ALSO FEEL THAT A SPARK PLUG COIL SHOULD BE MORE ROBUST THAN TO FAIL AT ONLY 11000 MILES.      I BELIEVE THIS FAILURE COULD REPRESENT A SEVERE DANGER TO MYSELF AND POSSIBLY TO OTHERS IF IT HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN.",

BOTH ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE AND SHAPE.  THE KNOB HAS ONE SAFETY FEATURE THAT REQUIRES THE BRAKE PEDAL TO BE DEPRESSED BEFORE THE POSITION FROM PARK TO R N D L IS SELECTED.

ONCE THE CAR COMES TO A STOP IT WILL BE IN REVERSE ,STEP ON THE GAS AND YOU ARE GOING BACKWARDS WITH LITTLE TIME TO REACT.  WE HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN, TEENS AND TOTS.

WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED HE HAD A HARD TIME WITH IT BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WOULD NOT RELEASE, AND THE WHEELS WOULD NOT ROLL. I COULDN'T MOVE THIS CAR IF I WANTED TO. I COULDN'T OPEN THE TRUNK, LOCK THE DOORS, USE FLASHERS, NOTHING... ANYTHING ELECTRICAL WAS OUT OF COMMISSION. MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP HAD THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS, SAID THEY \"PERFORMED MANY SOFTWARE UPGRADES\" AND \"TEST DROVE IT EXTENSIVELY\" AND THAT IT WAS FIXED. 20 MINUTES AFTER I PICKED IT UP, I WAS DRIVING IN THE CENTER LANE OF A 3-LANE HIGHWAY, WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD AND 1 YEAR OLD IN THE CAR, AND THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN AND THE CAR'S POWER AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHUT DOWN ALSO. LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO COAST INTO A PARKING LOT. I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN. THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP SAID IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, I CAN REPLACE THE CAR OR THEY WILL BUY IT BACK. I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS CAR AGAIN. I WAS LUCKY THE FIRST TIME, BARELY LUCKY THE SECOND TIME, WHO KNOWS WHAT SITUATION I MIGHT BE IN IF I AGREE TO LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN? I CANNOT PUT MY CHILDREN IN THIS CAR AGAIN. THIS VEHICLE IS A SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY RISK, AND ALSO POSES ADDITIONAL RISKS TO OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD AROUND IT. SINCE EVERYTHING SHUTS OFF WHEN THIS HAPPENS, IF I WERE TO GET INTO A CRASH AS A RESULT OF IT, THE AIRBAGS LIKELY WOULD NOT DEPLOY, ADDING TO THE RISK OF INJURY. I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN A CHRYSLER 200, I NO LONGER WANT THIS VEHICLE.",

MY WIFE AND I BOTH WORK, AND NEED BOTH CARS, BUT I WILL SACRIFICE MISSING WORK TO ENSURE SHE MAKES IT TO HER JOB SAFELY.  AGAIN, I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE.

FINALLY I NOTICE THAT AS I BRAKE OR LOWER MY SPEED THE GEARS DO NOT ADJUSTING ACCORDINGLY. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS IS MOSTLY A PROBLEM WHEN I BRAKE TO A SPEED LOWER THAN ABOUT 25MPH. IN THESE INSTANCES, UNLESS I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT DROP BELOW 3RD GEAR.    I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM AND RECEIVED A ENTIRELY NEW TRANSMISSION. NOW, ABOUT 6,000 MILES LATER I AM EXPERIENCING THE SAME SHIFTING ISSUES.  *TR",

THIS HAPPENED CONSISTENTLY UNTIL I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR AT 9,300 MILES. THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP IT FROM DANGEROUSLY ROLLING WAS TO ALWAYS HAVE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON. WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, TWO SERVICE WRITERS VERIFIED THE PROBLEM BY ROLLING THE CAR WHEN IT WAS IN NEUTRAL, BUT THE MECHANIC SAID THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T  REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAID THE CAR WAS FINE. AS I DROVE IT AWAY, WHILE STILL ON THE DEALER LOT, I PARKED (PLACING THE CAR IN PARK, OF COURSE) AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO ASK THE SERVICE WRITER ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION. AS I WALKED AWAY, THE CAR ROLLED FORWARD ABOUT 25 FEET AND CRASHED INTO A NEW CHRYSLER CAN ON THE DEALER LOT ' CAUSING DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND THE NEW DEALER CAR. MY EXPERIENCE FITS EXACTLY WITH THE FOLLOWING CHRYSLER RECALL FROM APRIL OF THIS YEAR:     APRIL 2014 -- CHRYSLER GROUP LLC (CHRYSLER) IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2014 RAM 1500 4X4 VEHICLES MANUFACTURED JANUARY 24, 2014, THROUGH FEBRUARY 5, 2014. IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLES, THE TRANSMISSION CASE MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY MACHINED WHICH CAN RESULT IN THE PARK PAWL NOT PROPERLY ENGAGING WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS IN THE 'PARK' POSITION. IF THE PARK PAWL DOES NOT PROPERLY ENGAGE, THE VEHICLE MAY ROLLAWAY, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH AND OCCUPANT OR PEDESTRIAN INJURIES. CHRYSLER WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL INSPECT AND REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION, AS NECESSARY, FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN MAY 2014.

ON JULY 8, 2014 THE CAR STALLED AND TOTALLY SHUT DOWN. THE CAR WAS LOCKED AND WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. I ATTEMPTED TO PLACE THE CAR IN PARK HOWEVER THE CONTROL KNOB (CENTER CONSOLE ON THESE CARS) TO DO SO WAS LOCKED AND WOULD NOT MOVE.  THE ENGINE WAS SHUT DOWN HOWEVER ALL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE STILL ACTIVE WITHIN THE CAR. SEVERAL SERVICE MESSAGES CYCLED THROUGH THE DISPLAY ON THE VEHICLE; THEREFORE I CONTACTED CHRYSLER ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ARRIVED AND MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST CHRYSLER DEALER (NOT THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM). ONCE AT THE DEALER I WAS INFORMED THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BUSY. THEREFORE MY CAR REMAINED ON THE LOT, ALL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE STILL RUNNING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NIGHT (APPROXIMATELY 12-15 HOURS) BEFORE IT WAS LOOKED AT. IN THAT TIME THE BATTERY HAD DIED, ONCE IT WAS JUMPED IT STARTED AND IT WAS ABLE TO BE PULLED INTO A SERVICE BAY. AFTER 2 DAYS IN THE SERVICE DEPT I WAS INFORMED THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE ISSUE THAT CAUSED THE CAR TO TOTALLY SHUT DOWN AND LOCK UP WHILE DRIVING. THEY \"ROAD TESTED\" THE CAR 102 MILES AS INSTRUCTED BY CHRYSLER HOWEVER NO CODES WERE ACTIVE IN REGARDS TO THE INCIDENT ON JULY 8, 2014. THEY HAVE NOW RETURNED MY CAR TO ME WITHOUT THIS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BEING ADDRESSED. THE FINAL VERDICT FROM THE DEALER WAS, WE CANNOT RECREATE THE STALLING AND SHUTDOWN THEREFORE WE WILL BE RETURNING THE CAR TO YOU. THE CAR WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW AND I HAVE HAD IT 3 WEEKS.  *TR",
