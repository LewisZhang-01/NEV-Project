IT WAS REPLACED ON 2/906, 7/10/07, AND 12/3/07 IN IL, AND AGAIN IN CA IN 7/08.    IN 12/07 MY IN-LAWS PURCHASED A NEW CAR AND GAVE THE '04 CTS TO MY HUSBAND AND I (CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS).  SINCE RECEIVING THIS CAR, IT INTERMITTENTLY DISPLAYED A 'SERVICE BRAKE ASSIST' WARNING.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL BEARING/SPEED SENSOR/HUB WAS REPLACED AGAIN AT A LOCAL CA DEALERSHIP ON 7/30/08.    THE 'SERVICE BRAKE ASSIST' WARNING HAS CONTINUED TO BE DISPLAYED RARELY BUT INTERMITTENTLY DURING THIS TIME.  EARLIER THIS SPRING, I WAS TURNING INTO A PARKING LOT AT A SLOW SPEED WHEN THE BRAKES DID NOT ENGAGE.  WE TOOK THE CAR DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY RECOMMENDED THAT WE REPLACE THE TIRES (WHICH WE DID) AND THEN RECOMMENDED THAT WE REPLACE THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING/SPEED SENSOR/HUB AGAIN FOR THE 5TH TIME.  WE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT (OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM) SO TOOK IT HOME TO INVESTIGATE.     WE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THE CAR WAS BRAKING AND TOOK IT BACK IN LAST WEEK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  WE WERE TOLD AGAIN THAT WE SHOULD REPLACE THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING/SPEED SENSOR/HUB ASSEMBLY.  WE REFUSED ASKING THEM TO PLEASE FURTHER INVESTIGATE WHY THE SAME PART WAS FAILING.  WE CALLED GM DIRECTLY AND THEY BECAME INVOLVED.    THE DEALERSHIP CALLED YESTERDAY TO TELL US THAT IN FACT THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL PART DOES NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED, AND THAT ACTUALLY THE COMPUTER THAT NEEDS REPLACING.    LIKELY THIS HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG (IE, THAT PART WAS REPLACED 4 TIMES WHEN IT HAS REALLY BEEN A COMPUTER ISSUE).  THE CAR SHOWED THESE PROBLEMS WITHIN THE FIRST 20K MILES.

AT THIS POINT SHE DECIDED TO RETURN HOME WITH VEHICLE. WHEN SHE RETURNED SHE HAD ME INSPECT THE CAR, AS THERE WAS STEAM EMITTING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  UPON OPENING THE HOOD THE SOURCE OF THE STEAM WAS REVEALED AS THE VENT OUTLETS ON THE BATTERY.  THE BATTERY WAS HOT AND WAS VENTING SULFURIC ACID STEAM.    THE BATTERY IS LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE FIREWALL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE AIR INTAKE GRILLS FOR CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM.  THE SULFURIC STEAM WAS BEING SUCKED INTO THE AIR INTAKE OF THE HVAC SYSTEM AND THEN BEING EMITTED INTO THE CABIN VIA THE VENT SYSTEM.  MY WIFE HAD INHALED THIS CAUSTIC GAS FOR THE PERIOD SHE DROVE THE CAR CAUSING HER TO HAVE SEVERE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS REQUIRING AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT.  SHE WAS TREATED FOR SEVERE RESPIRATORY IRRITATION DUE TO EXPOSURE TO THE CAUSTIC GAS.  THE SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESS FROM THIS EXPOSURE LASTED 8-10 DAYS AND INCLUDED A NUMBER OF FOLLOW UP VISITS TO THE DOCTOR.     AT THIS TIME THERE HAS BEEN NO DEFINITE CAUSE OR REASON TO WHY THE BATTERY FAILED.
