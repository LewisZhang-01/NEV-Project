I have had my 6 and 9 year old granddaughters in the car with me. If I had been on the interstate in heavy traffic taking them to their doctor appointments, we would have been killed. The third time this thing went out I had to pull into the shoulder of the road to avoid being hit. I believe Honda knows about this problem and they should be made to replace the part for free. This is a major safety hazard and the part runs almost $2000 without the labor. I believe they want to drag their feet and not recall this part because it's so expensive. I don't want to die in my car and I can't afford to buy another one.  Thanks.",

OUR HONDA IS DRIVEN BY MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER AND IS IT FREQUENTLY NECESSARY TO HAVE OTHER PASSENGERS IN THE CAR.   I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS FOR SAFETY.    AS OF AUGUST WE STILL HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING BACK REGARDING THE PARTS.  I SENT A REQUEST TO AMERICAN HONDA TO INQUIRE ABOUT AN ALTERNATE VEHICLE.   ON 8/23/16 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM AH.   THERE ANSWER WAS THAT ONLY THE PASSENGER SIDE WAS AFFECTED AND THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO AVOID ANY PASSENGER ON THAT SIDE.  AND THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A PASSENGER THERE WOULD BE NO PROVISION FOR ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION.   I STILL EXPRESSED MY CONCERN FOR SAFETY AND THE INCONVENIENCE OF HAVING TO DRIVE A SEPARATE CAR SHOULD WE NEED TO TRANSPORT ADDITIONAL PASSENGERS.  AT THAT TIME THE REP CALLED DICK BROOKS WHO TOLD HER THE PART(S) HAD NEVER BEEN ORDERED BUT THAT THEY WOULD ORDER AND WOULD POSSIBLY BE IN BY THURSDAY (8/25).  TODAY IS 8/30/16 AND THE PART IS STILL ON BACK-ORDER PER MY CALL TO THE PARTS MANAGER.   MY CONCERN REMAINS THE SAME.

I LIVE ON A ISLAND SURROUNDED BY WATER AND IN HIGH HUMID CONDITIONS. IN THE SUMMER HIGH HUMID CONDITIONS EXIST IN ABOUT 4 MONTHS A YEAR HERE ON LONG ISLAND. BUT BECAUSE HONDA DOES NOT LIST MY LOCATION AS PART OF THE RECALL CAMPAIGN I AM NOT ENTITLED TO THE TAKATA AIR BAG REPLACEMENT.  WHEN I CONTACT HONDA THEY CANNOT CONFIRM IF MY VEHICLE EVEN CONTAINS ONE OF THESE AFFECTED AIR BAGS BUT JUST THAT I AM NOT PART OF THE RECALL CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF MY LOCATION. I THINK THIS UNFAIR THAT NHTSA IS EVEN ALLOWING HONDA TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IS PUTTING MY FAMILY AT RISK IN ONE OF THESE VEHICLES.  PLEASE PRESSURE HONDA TO MAKE THEM REPAIR ALL THE AFFECTED VEHICLES AND TO NOT PUT COST ABOVE PEOPLES SAFETY. THEY MADE THE ERROR WITH TAKATA AND WHY SHOULD WE PAY THE PRICE ON SAFETY.

THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SLIP IN ALL GEARS, SO I COULD NOT PUT THE VEHICLE DIRECTLY INTO 1ST, 2ND, 3RD,OR 4TH GEAR TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY. LUCKILY, I WAS CLOSE TO HOME WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED BUT IT TOOK A FEW ENGINE COOL DOWNS TO GET THE VEHICLE DRIVEN OFF THE HIGHWAY TO A SAFE LOCATION TO BE TOWED TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP. HONDA SAID THE TRANSMISSION WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED WITH A FACTORY-REBUILD. I OWN TWO OTHER HONDA'S (ONE IS A 1990 ACCORD WITH ABOUT 250,000 MILES ON IT) AND HAVE NEVER HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IN EITHER CAR. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I CAN HAVE A 23 YEAR OLD HONDA WITH 250,000 MILES ON IT THAT HAS SEEN ABSOLUTELY NO TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BUT HAVE A MUCH NEWER 6 YEAR OLD 118,000 MILE HONDA CR-V WITH A 100% FAILED TRANSMISSION NEEDING COMPETE REPLACEMENT. I HAVE SEARCHED ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND I SEE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT 100% COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH 2004-2006 HONDA CR-V'S. THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE NEWER CR-V TRANSMISSIONS THAT HONDA HAS NOT REPORTED (AS OF YET). THE HONDA DEALERSHIP I TOOK MY CAR TO, SAID THAT I WAS THE 1ST CR-V TRANSMISSION THEY EVER REPLACED FROM THE 2004-2006 CR-V SERIES. HONDA ORIGINALLY QUOTED MY $4000 TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A FACTORY-REBUILT BUT THEY CONTACTED THE REGIONAL HONDA REP AND WAS ABLE TO LOWER THE PRICE DOWN TO $3000. THAT PRICE IS ABSURD, AS I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT A TRANSMISSION WILL ONLY LAST 118,000 MILES. IT WILL BE VERY TOUGH FOR MY FAMILY TO EVEN THINK ABOUT PURCHASING ANY HONDA'S IN THE FUTURE. I HAVE TALKED TO EVERYONE ABOUT HOW GREAT HONDA CARS ARE, WITH A 23 YEAR OLD HONDA STILL GOING. NO MORE WILL I RECOMMEND A HONDA!  *TR",

ON REMOVING THE SPARE TIRE COVER, IT WAS NOTICED THAT ONLY TWO OF THE THREE TIRE LUGS THAT SUPPORT THE TIRE WERE IN PLACE.  THE VEHICLE CAME WITH THREE TIRE LUGS FOR THE SPARE, AS THIS WAS NOTICED WHEN A DIFFERENT SPARE TIRE COVER WAS INSTALLED WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF VEHICLE OWNERSHIP.  THE DAMAGED TIRE WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW TIRE AND THE SERVICEMAN WENT TO PLACE THIS NEW TIRE ON THE EXTERIOR SPARE TIRE CARRIER.  HE SHEARED OFF ONE MORE OF THE LUGS AND STATED THAT HE HAD NOT APPLIED EXCESSIVE FORCE TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN.  HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND LUG NOW MISSING AND THAT THE SPARE TIRE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE EXTERIOR SPARE TIRE CARRIER WITH ONLY A SINGLE LUG TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF THE SPARE TIRE.  THE SPARE TIRE WAS PLACED IN THE INTERIOR REAR STORAGE AREA.  I WAS GIVEN THE SHEARED OFF LUG, WHICH I STILL HAVE IN MY POSSESSION, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE IF STRUCTURAL FAILURE WAS THE RESULT BY EXAMINATION OF A METALLURGIST.  CONTACTING THE DEALER WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED (HONDA OF BOWIE, MD), THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM, AT NO COST TO ME, AS A LATENT DEFECT, AS THEY STATED IT WAS BEYOND THE NORMAL WARRANTY PERIOD.  THEY QUESTIONED WHETHER THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN SERVICED ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE MANUAL.  I RESPONDED THAT THE SPARE TIRE CARRIER LUGS ARE NOT A SERVICEABLE ITEM (EXCEPT TO TIGHTEN THE LUGS TO RETAIN THE TIRE) AND THAT THE LUGS SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.  I WAS REFERRED TO THE NEXT HONDA LEVEL OF APPEAL, WHERE I AM STILL AWAITING A RESOLUTION.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM IN THAT THE SPARE TIRE CAN POSSIBLY FALL OFF THE VEHICLE IF THE SPARE TIRE LUGS FAIL, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS DOCUMENTED FOR OTHER CR-V OWNERS TO HELP WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS. *TR",

IN ADDITION, THE PTTR IS INCREASED BY EVEN MODERATE ACCELERATION.   THIS CONDITION WAS APPARENT THE DAY WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, HOWEVER, WE WERE ASSURED THAT AN ALIGNMENT WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM. SO FAR, THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN FOR REPAIR 3 TIMES. THIS INCLUDED, AN ALIGNMENT, A 5 DAY PERIOD WHERE A HONDA TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE WAS CALLED IN TO OVERSEE THE REPAIRS, AND LASTLY A 4 DAY DEALER VISIT WITH REPAIR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HONDA TECHNICAL.  THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THAT HONDA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CORRECT THE PTTR PROBLEM.  WE FEEL THAT THE PTTR PROBLEM IS SEVERE AND IT CREATES AN UNSAFE DRIVING SITUATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE FILED A CLAIM WITH THE BBB THAT REQUESTS HONDA TO EITHER REPLACE OR REPURCHASE THE VEHICLE. HONDA HAS DENIED THE REQUEST. AN ARBITRATION HEARING IS PENDING.  *NM",
