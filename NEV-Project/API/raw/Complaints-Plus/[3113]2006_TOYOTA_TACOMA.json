WHY ARE THEY DRAGGING THEIR FEET NOT SENDING AN ACTUAL RECALL THAT THEY WILL PAY THEIR DEALERS AFTER THEY PERFORM THE WORK?  WHY IS THIS RECALL NOT NOTED ABOVE.  ARE THEY TRYING TO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?  IN RED, THE LETTER STATES \"THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL:\"  BUT THE TOYOTA DEALER \"TEAM TOYOTA\" KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT,SAID THEY COULD CHECK AND FIX, BUT WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THEN MAYBE BE REIMBURSED BY TOYOTA BUT THEY COULDN'T SAY I WOULD BE.  CAN YOU HELP WITH THIS??

RECENTLY, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE HOW BADLY RUSTED A SECTION OF THE ROOF OF MY CAB WAS.  I CHECKED ONLINE TO SEE IF OTHERS WERE HAVING A SIMILAR ISSUE AND FOUND PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF THIS SEEMED TO OWN PICK-UPS THAT WERE ALSO PAINTED BLACK, AND WERE ALSO 2006 MODELS. THE RUST PATTERNS SEEMED SIMILAR IN EVERY PICTURE I VIEWED, A PORTION OF THE ROOF ABOVE THE DRIVERS SIDE, RUSTED THE LENGTH FROM NEAR THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AREA TO NEAR THE BACK OF THE CAB. IN MY OPINION, AND BASED ON THE PICTURES OF SIMILAR INSTANCES I'VE VIEWED ONLINE, THERE SEEMS TO POSSIBLY BE SOME COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF A DEFICIENCY IN THE PAINTING METHOD OR MATERIAL USED ON THIS COLOR/YEAR TRUCK. IS THERE A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN IN THE WORKS?  I BELIEVE TOYOTA NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE AS SOMETHING DOES NOT SEEM QUITE RIGHT AND THAT THEY SHOULD ADDRESS THESE ANOMALIES IN AN EFFORT TO REACH A FAIR RESOLUTION?  BTW, THE REAR BUMPER'S EXCEPTIONALLY RUSTED OUT TOO, AND THE PLASTIC HEADLIGHT COVERINGS ON THIS MODEL HAVE CLOUDED UP WORSE THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ANY OTHER VEHICLE MAKE, AS MOST OTHER HEADLIGHTS THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH ARE MADE OF GLASS.

AFTER NOTIFICATION, JULY 2015, I BROUGHT MY CAR TO TOYOTA OF WALLINGFORD (DEALER) AS INSTRUCTED IN THE RECALL NOTICE FOR A FRAME INSPECTION.  THE DEALER INSPECTED THE TRUCK FRAME AND SAID IT WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A NEW FRAME AS THE FRAME PASSED THEIR INSPECTION. I DISPUTED THIS BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO PUSH MY FINGER THROUGH PARTS OF THE FRAME. THEY INSISTED THAT THE INTEGRITY WAS SOUND. THEIR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO SPRAY THE CAR WITH A CORROSION RESISTANT COVERING (CRC). AFTER SOME DEBATE I TOOK THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND AUTHORIZED THE WORK.  THE CRC WAS A THICK BLACK GEL THAT COVERED THE FRAME, SO RUST, ROT AND DETERIORATION WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN. IN RETROSPECT, I BELIEVE THEY INTENTIONALLY COVERED THE RUST SO ISSUES COULD NOT BE DETECTED AND RE-INSPECTION DID NOT OCCUR.   RECENTLY I HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRES ON THE TRUCK. WHEN THE TIRE DEALER PUT THE TRUCK ON THE LIFT HE NOTICED THE FRAME WAS BOWING AND LARGE PIECES OF THE FRAME WERE MISSING. THE CRC WAS STILL COVERING THE RUST BUT LARGE HOLES IN THE FRAME WERE DETECTED.  THE TIRE SPECIALIST WOULD NOT WORK ON THE TRUCK DUE TO THE UNSTABLE FRAME, SO I QUICKLY CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER TO RE-INSPECT THE FRAME.

THEY WOULD NOT COVER ANY REPAIRS ALTHOUGH I FOLLOWED EVERY STEP AND ENDURED EVERY INCONVENIENCE FOR A ROT ISSUE THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  UNSATISFIED WITH THE DEALER'S RESPONSE, I CONTACTED TOYOTA DIRECTLY AND THEY REAFFIRMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE FRAME.   TOYOTA DID NOT RESOLVE ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THEIR FAULTY FRAMES.

IT HAS NOW BEEN 37 DAYS AND TOYOTA IS REFUSING TO GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION.  I HAVE DONE ALL THE RECALLS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED ON THE 2006 TACOMA.  ON ONE RECALL THEY INSTALLED AN OVERRIDE THAT WOULD HAVE DECREASED ACCELERATION IN THE EVENT THAT BOTH THE BRAKE AND GAS WERE BEING DEPRESSED AT THE SAME TIME.  THIS DID NOT WORK IN MY ACCIDENT.  I HAVE NOTICED ON THIS SITE THAT THERE ARE 144 OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF TRUCK OF THE SAME THING OCCURRING, YET THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THE TRUCK IS UNSAFE?  I AM CONVINCED THAT THE TRUCK IS A DANGER AND TOYOTA IS NOT RESPONDING AND HAVE MISSED THE DEADLINE OF GETTING ME THE REPORT WITHIN 30 DAYS.",

OVERT THE NEXT TWO MILES TO OUR HOUSE ON A 35MPH ROAD, SHE STOPPED THE TRUCK FINE (ONCE AT A STOP SIGN, AND ONCE AT OUR MAILBOX).

THE TRUCK HAS A PUSH-BAR ON THE FRONT AND THAT WAS PUSHED INTO THE FRONT BUMPER AND GRILL, THE TACOMA'S FRONT BUMPER IS CONCAVED IN THE MIDDLE AND THE ENDS ARE BROKEN FROM WHERE THE JOIN THE FRONT FENDERS, THE LOWER GRILL AREA ALSO BROKE.

HE RECOMMENDED SAND BLASTING AND RE-APPLYING RUST PROTECTANT SOON BEFORE RUST CAUSES A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.     08/11/16, OWNER OF A BODY SHOP EVALUATED AND SAID IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE RUST.

I HAVE ENCLOSED THE PAPERWORK DESCRIBING THE REPAIR, WHICH I BELIEVE WAS TIED TO A RECALL, AND ANOTHER REPAIR.     OCTOBER 19, 2012, THE RIGHT REAR LEAF SPRING CRACKED AND NEEDED REPAIR, MILEAGE WAS 92303. AT THE TIME WE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE RECALL FOR THE LEAF SPRINGS, AND THE REPAIR FOR THE RIGHT HAD COST US 1408.11.   THE REPAIR SHOP ALSO NOTICED AT THE TIME THAT THE LEFT REAR LEAF SPRING WAS ALSO FAULTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED, THAT WAS REPAIRED A FEW DAYS LATER 10/23/2012 THE COST 1407.61.  AT THE TIME WE HAD DRIVEN AROUND NOT KNOWING WHAT THE VIBRATION WAS ONLY THAT THE VEHICLE WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE. THE FAULTY LEAF SPRINGS WE WERE TOLD AT A LATER DATE BY THE TOYOTA DEALER MAY HAVE PLAYED A FACTOR IN THE ABOVE REPAIR.  THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CAUSED BY THE FAULTY LEAF SPRING.      ON OCTOBER 27, 2006 THE HEAD GASKET NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED, THE MILEAGE AT THIS TIME WAS 90102.

        "summary": "AFTER RELOCATING TO DALY CITY, CA. 94015 ( PACIFIC COAST AREA ) ABOUT A 1.5 YEAR AGO. I NOTICED THE FRAME OF MY 2006 TOYOTA TACOMA STARTED TO EXHIBIT SOME CORROSION THROUGHOUT. UPON SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, TOYOTA HAS INITIATED A LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN \"E0D\" IN THE FOLLOWING STATES: CT DE IL IN KY MA MD ME MI MN NH NJ NY OH PA RI VA VT WI WV & D.C. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. FOR 05-08 TACOMA VEHICLES OPERATED IN SPECIFIC COLD CLIMATE AREAS WITH HIGH ROAD SALT USE, MAY EXHIBIT MORE THAN NORMAL CORROSION TO THE FRAME. AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WILL INSPECT THE FRAME. IF SIGNIFICANT RUST PERFORATION IS NOT FOUND*, CORROSION-RESISTANT COMPOUNDS (CRC) WILL BE APPLIED TO KEY AREAS OF THE FRAME. IF AN AUTHORIZED DEALER CONFIRMS THE FRAME HAS SIGNIFICANT RUST PERFORATION*, AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY WILL BE PROVIDED.    THE PROBLEM IS QUESTION HERE SHOULDN'T ONLY BE ADDRESSED TO VEHICLES LOCATED IN THE STATES ABOVE, BUT A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL 2005-2008 MODELS AFFECTED NATIONWIDE. PACIFIC COAST AREAS MAY NOT EXPERIENCE HIGH ROAD SALT USAGE, BUT THERE ARE OTHER CLIMATE ELEMENTS LIKE SALT MOISTURE FROM THE PACIFIC OCEAN THAT CAN ALSO ACCELERATE CORROSION IN METAL FRAMES IF IT'S NOT WELL DESIGNED OR COATED. THIS ISSUE AFFECTS THE CORE OF THE VEHICLE FRAME AND ITS INTEGRITY DURING NORMAL OPERATION AND IN AN EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.     IF TOYOTA BELIEVES THEIR 05-08 TACOMA MODELS ARE HAVING CORROSION ISSUES IN THE ABOVE STATES, WHY IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR THOSE LIVING CLOSE TO COASTAL AREAS WITH HIGH SALT MOISTURE LIKE DALY CITY, SAN FRANCISCO, PACIFIC, HALF NOON BAY AND CITIES IN PROXIMITY TO THE COAST.

IF THEY FAIL DRIVING IT COULD CAUSE ALOT MORE THAN A FIRE.

I HAVE NEVER BEEN CALLED FOR THE REPAIRS AND IT MONTHS LATER.

NOW I ASK WHY WOULD THEY LEAVE ME IN A OPEN REPAIR ORDER AND TELL ME IT WAS DUE TO THE REAR LEAF SPRING RECALL IF I JUST CAME IN FOR NOISE. THE SERVICE DEPT TOLD ME TODAY ON THE PHONE WITH CORP THAT THEY JUST LUBE THE SPRINGS IF THEY MAKE NOISE. MY HUSBAND SAID THAT IS FOR SQUEAKING NOT FOR BANGING AND CLUNKING AND HE AGREED. I AM STILL AGGRAVATED THAT THE REPAIRS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AND I STILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER AND LET THEM INSPECT IT AGAIN EVEN THOUGH IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

THEN A FEW MOMENTS LATER IT WOULD FEEL BETTER BUT THE RETURN MOTION IN THE POWER STEERING WOULD STILL BE SLUGGISH. THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE SAID TO CHECK THE FLUID LEVEL AND ADD FLUID IF NECESSARY. I TOPPED OFF THE POWER STEERING FLUID. THAT HELPED A LITTLE, BUT THE SLUGGISHNESS IN THE POWER STEERING CONTINUED TO BE ERRATIC.  MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR 1/7/2015 WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  UPON ARRIVING AT THE DEALERSHIP, ONE OF  THE SERVICE WRITERS EXPLAINED THAT THE UNIVERSAL JOINT IN THE POWER STEERING COLUMN HAD GOTTEN DIRTY OVER THE YEARS AND WAS NOW SLOWLY BREAKING DOWN.  HE SAID IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX AND TO JUST CONTINUE DRIVING UNTIL IT GRADUALLY IS CONSISTENTLY VERY SLUGGISH.  GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY A 65 MPH AND HAVING THE POWER STEERING FREEZE UP ON YOU AS YOU ARE MAKING A TURN IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR ME, MY FAMILY AND OTHER MOTORIST.

I ALSO WANT TO ADD, THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN AW FLOOR MAT FOR TACOMA VEHICLES, THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INTERFERENCE WITH THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, AND THAT THE ONLY REASON I CHANGED THE MATS WAS DUE TO THE MAT RIBS STARTING TO BREAK ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  IN ADDITION, THE CAMPAIGN CALLED FOR THE FLOOR CARPET TO BE VACUUM CLEANED AND SHAMPOOED, AND NONE OF THIS WAS DONE.  THE DEALER SIMPLY SWAPPED-OUT THE FLOOR MATS AND CHARGED-OUT $185 TO \"RECALL WORK\", I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY DID ANY PEDAL ADJUSTMENT.  HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM: THE NEW, THIN, FLIMSY FLOOR MAT USES THE OLD FLOOR MAT RETAINER HOOKS THAT WERE  INTENDED FOR THE THICK ALL WEATHER FLOOR MATS.  THESE FLOOR MAT HOOKS HURT MY FEET WHEN DRIVING BAREFOOT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY CAN, THEY WILL, AND THEY HAVE CAUGHT AND HOOKED-UP THE HEEL OF MY SHOES ON OCCASION.  I AM A VERY SAFE DRIVER, DO NOT TAILGATE VEHICLES, AND I TELL YOU NOW, THESE HOOKS HAVE CAUSED ME TO GET INTO EMBARRASSING SITUATIONS AND VERY NEAR ACCIDENTS DUE TO MY SHOE GETTING CAUGHT IN THE HOOKS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO BRAKE PROPERLY AND ON TIME.  IF I MODIFY THE HOOKS OR CUT THEM, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE NEW MAT WILL SLIDE-UP UNDER THE PEDALS, PREVENTING USE OF THE BRAKES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.

I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ISN'T AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS KIND OF RUST IS NOT NORMAL BY ANY STANDARD. I HAVE SEEN MANY MAKES AND MODELS OF PICK UP TRUCKS FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN THIS ONE WITH LITTLE OR NO RUST TO THEIR FRAMES. I'M SURE THAT THERE IS A TEST TO DETERMINE WHAT QUALITY STEEL THEY USED ON TACOMA FRAME. IS IT CHINA RECYCLED STEEL? (NOTHING ELSE WOULD RUST SO QUICK AND SO BAD.) IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT AUTOMAKER OF THIS SIZE WOULD PUT 2 TONS OF WEIGHT ON FRAMES SO DEFECTIVE, TO SAVE FEW DOLLARS. FRAME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE VEHICLE ,EVERYTHING RIDES ON IT INCLUDING PERSONS LIFE. FOR TOYOTA TO SAY THAT YOU NEED HOLES IN THE FRAME BEFORE THEY MAY OR MAY NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS GREEDY. THEY SHOULD HAVE USED THE RIGHT KIND OF MATERIAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. FOR OVER $30,000 FOR THEIR PICK UP TRUCK MOST PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT THE FRAME TO BE MADE OUT OF STEEL NOT MUD; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. AFTER ALL $30,000 IS NO POCKET CHANGE FOR MOST PEOPLE. I AM SURE THEY WOULD NOT BE SAYING THAT IF IT WAS THEIR FAMILY MEMBER DRIVING THEIR TACOMA ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH. I COULD GO ON ABOUT THIS, BUT WHAT'S THE POINT? THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROTECT IT'S CITIZENS FROM CHEATERS LIKE TOYOTA, NOT LET THEM GET AWAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BILLIONS. AVERAGE CITIZEN DOES NOT STAND A CHANCE AGAINST CORPORATION OF THAT SIZE. \"TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS AT TOYOTA I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A PEACEFUL DEATH WHEN THE TIME COMES, AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ALL THE PROFITS WITH YOU.

AUTO ELECTRIC REPAIR SHOP REQUIRED $2800 IN PARTS AND $2000 FOR LABOR TO REPAIR MELTED WIRING LOOMS AND FUSE BOX; THEY SUGGESTED THAT FAILURE COULD HAVE RESULTED BECAUSE TOYOTA USES A 30 AMP FUSE ON A #12 WIRE CIRCUIT THAT WILL MELT AND BURN BEFORE THE FUSE BLOWS.

ONCE STOPPED THE FIRST THING I CHECKED WAS THE FLOOR MAT AS I HAD A PROBLEM WITH PREVIOUS VEHICLE CAUSING THE ACCELERATOR TO STICK BUT THE FLOOR MAT WAS NO WHERE NEAR THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE BUT IT JUST REVVED WIDE OPEN SO I TURNED IT BACK OFF AND CALLED ARLINGTON TOYOTA.  I WAS ADVISED TO CALL A WRECKER AS THEY SAID THEY HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE BEFORE.  THEY HAD IT FOR THREE DAYS BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS AS IT RUN PERFECTLY WHEN OFF LOADED OFF THE WRECKER.  I WAS ADVISED TO INSTALL MAT RETAINING PINS.  THEN I RECEIVED A RECALL FOR THE FLOOR MATS AND WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR RECALL I WAS ADVISED TO REMOVED THE DRIVERS SIDE FLOORMAT.  I WAS TOLD NOTHING MORE THAT TOYOTA AS TO WHAT WAS BEING ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE.  IS THAT A VIABLE RECALL?  I KNOW FOR A FACT IT WAS NOT THE FLOOR MAT THAT CAUSED THE ISSUE BUT WAS ADVISED BY TOYOTA THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF UNEXPLAINED ACCELERATION WITH TACOMA'S. MY VEHICLE IS A 2006 TACOMA PRERUNNER ACCESS CAB, V6, AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WITH TOWING PACKAGE. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT TOYOTA WOULD RAPIDLY GET FIX IN PLACE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AND FOR  THIS REASON I AM SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT. *TR",

JUST AS I WAS JUST PAST THE SLOW VEHICLE I NOTICED I WANTED TO TAKE THE UPCOMING OFF RAMP, SO I ACCELERATED BRIEFLY TO GAIN SPEED TO MOVE BACK INTO THE SLOWER LANE., FORTUNATELY TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE STARTED RACING, I HAD LET OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND NOTHING HAPPENED, INSTEAD I APPLIED BOTH FEET FIRST GENTLY QUICKLY FIRMLY TO THE BRAKE EVEN WITH THE BRAKE FIRMLY APPLIED WITH BOTH FEET MY SPEED WAS WELL IN EXCESS OF 80MPH AND THE ENGINE WAS RACING. SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IN FRONT OF ME WAS MY OFFRAMP AND TRAFFIC,  LOTS OF IT. I ASKED MY HUSBAND SITTING NEXT TO ME IF HE COULD REACH DOWN AND PRY THE ACCELERATOR FROM THE FLOOR, HE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY, AT THIS POINT I NEW I HAD TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY OR REAR END SOMEONE ON THE HIGHWAY FIRST, THEN AGAIN THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OFF THE RAMP WHICH WAS A FAIRLY SHORT RIGHT SWEEPING RAMP. I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD MAKE IT AND WAS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT HITTING SOMEONE ELSE SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THE RAMP, AT THE SAME TIME CAREFULLY HOLDING THE WHEEL I DUCKED UNDER IT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND JERKED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL OUT TO THE TOP,IMMEDIATELY RETURNED ABOVE TO THE TURNING RAMP BOTH FEET STILL PRESSED HARD ON THE BRAKE AND JUST AS I GOT TO THE END OF THE RAMP, THE VEHICLE STOPPED RIGHT IN FRONT OF MCDONALD'S..

SUBSEQUENT TO THIS DISCOVERY I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAD INSTITUTED A CUSTOMER SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR OWNERS OF 1995-2004 TACOMAS ADDRESSING THIS EXACT ISSUE. ON JANUARY 15, 2010 I TOOK MY TRUCK TO GATEWAY TOYOTA IN TOM'S RIVER NJ, THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT MY THEN NEW TRUCK IN 2006 AND HAD THEIR SERVICE MANAGER  INSPECT MY TRUCK. I WAS PRESENT DURING THIS INSPECTION AND I POINTED OUT THE LARGE ARREARS OF RUST AND FLAKING METAL ON MY FRAME, CROSSMEMBERS AND TRAILER HITCH TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THAT UNLESS MY FRAME HAD ACTUAL HOLES IN IT CAUSED BY RUST NOTHING COULD OR WOULD BE DONE TO CORRECT THE OBVIOUS CORROSION OF THESE VITAL COMPONENTS. THIS RUST PROBLEM IS AN ISSUE THAT TOYOTA HAS BEEN AVOIDING DEALING WITH FOR MANY YEARS AND I FEEL THAT IGNORING THIS ISSUE IS AFFECTING THE SAFETY AND VALUE OF MY TRUCK. IT IS BEYOND LOGIC FOR TOYOTA TO ASSIST OWNERS OF OLDER VEHICLES AND IGNORE OWNERS OF NEWER AND MUCH MORE VALUABLE VEHICLES WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.

I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL HARD ENOUGH TO BOOST SPEED.  AS I ENTERED TRAFFIC, THE TRUCK JUST KEPT SPEEDING UP.   AFTER APPLYING A LIGHT BRAKE, I PUMPED THE GAS PEDAL SEVERAL TIMES AND IT THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY ENGAGED AND GEARED BACK DOWN.      2ND INSTANCE - WHILE LEAVING THE FREEWAY @ 65 MPH I SLOWED TO 45 MPH AND SWITCHED LANES TO THE RIGHT.  THEN I APPLIED GAS TO SPEED UP TO MERGE AND THE TRUCK DID NOT SLOW DOWN.   AGAIN THE LINK BETWEEN THE THROTTLE AND THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT SEEM TO REACTION AS IN A NORMAL SITUATION.  I HAD TO MERGE BACK BECAUSE THE WOULD NOT SLOW DOWN FAST ENOUGH.   AFTER 4-5 SECONDS THE TRUCK SLOWED DOWN.     3RD INSTANCE - AGAIN ENTERING THE FREEWAY.  I APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE GAS PEDAL TO SPEED UP ENOUGH TO ENTER THE TRAFFIC.  THIS TIME THE THROTTLE OPENED FULL BORE.  I PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL, LIGHTLY APPLIED THE BRAKE, AND PUMPED THE GAS PEDAL.   AFTER 5 SECONDS THE TRUCK FINALLY REVVED BACK DOWN.   I REACHED A SPEED OF OVER 90 MPH IN THIS INSTANCE.     4TH INSTANCE - DRIVING UPHILL THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY INCREASED THROTTLE WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TO THE PEDAL, THE TRUCK SURGED FORWARD, AGAIN FULL BORE.  I USED THE SAME TECHNIQUE AND IT EVENTUALLY SLOWED.      THIS PROBLEM IS DEFINITELY NOT A FLOOR MAT PROBLEM.  I NOW DRIVE MY TRUCK VERY GINGERLY SO AS NOT TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE.

BOTH TIMES, HE TOOK HIS FOOT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR AND HE COULD SEE IT MOVING DOWN TOWARDS THE FLOOR ALL BY ITSELF. IT STILL HAS AN IDLING PROBLEM. HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG; BY THE DEALER AT THE TIME.  NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE HIGH IDLING AND ACCELERATING PROBLEM. THIS MODEL IS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST.  MY SON IS DEAF AND HE CAN BE REACHED BY EMAIL.  *CN *TR",

I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH MY 2006 TACOMA. ON 10/29/09 WHILE TOWING A TRAILER I EXPERIENCED THE FIRST OCCURRENCE. I HAD TWO PASSENGERS WITH ME THAT CAN ATTEST TO THE TRUTH OF MY SITUATION. I DEPRESSED THE THROTTLE AND THE MOTOR SUDDENLY WENT TO A WIDE-OPEN POSITION. FORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW THE TRUCK WITH BRAKES ALONE BUT THEY COULD NOT STOP THE ACCELERATION OF THE TRUCK. MY ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION. I DID SO AND BROUGHT THE TRUCK AND TRAILER TO A SAFE STOP ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE POWER BRAKES BEING ACTIVE ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT I WAS ALSO TOWING A TRAILER.    I CHECKED THE THROTTLE AND GAS PEDAL CONNECTIONS AND FOUND NO OBVIOUS PROBLEMS. I THEN ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE TRUCK TO SEE IF POSSIBLY THE COMPUTER CLEARED ITSELF. WHEN I TURNED ON THE IGNITION, THE MOTOR STARTED AND INSTANTLY WENT INTO A FULL-OPEN THROTTLE MODE. I SHUT IT OFF BEFORE IT REACHED A VERY HIGH LEVEL. WE THEN CHECKED ALL THE SAME THINGS WE ALREADY CHECKED AND I DECIDED TO TRY STARTING THE TRUCK AGAIN. THIS TIME, IT STARTED AND RAN LIKE NOTHING EVER WAS WRONG. WE DROVE THE TRUCK HOME WITH NO OTHER PROBLEMS. I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I HAD PURCHASED IT. THEY INSPECTED BOTH THE THROTTLE BODY, ENGINE CODES, AND TEST DROVE IT AND TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG. I WAS SENT ON MY WAY WITH NO CHARGE TO ME. THEY GAVE ME NO PAPERWORK AS I NORMALLY GET BUT I DID CONFIRM THAT THIS COMPLAINT WAS PUT INTO THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM.    THIS SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED TO ME ONCE MORE ON 11/02/09 WHICH ALSO HAPPENED TO BE MY BIRTHDAY. I FEEL EXTREMELY FORTUNATE TO NOT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENT TO DATE BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AT THE PRESENT TIME.    REF.

NOTHING SLOWED IT DOWN, I WAS SLAMMING THROUGH THE (AUTOMATIC) GEARS DESPERATELY TRYING TO STOP THE TRUCK. I HAD TO GO OVER WALK WAYS AND CURBS TO AVOID PEDESTRIANS AND CEMENT BARRIERS.

FOUR MEN ATTEMPTED TO INSTALL THE SEAT AT THE DEALERSHIP AN THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AND HE MADE SOME PHONE CALLS ON OUR BEHALF.

A COMPLETELY NON-SPECIFIC, BLANKET STATEMENT THAT IF TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THE CUSHION FAILED DURING A CRASH, COULD HAVE DEVASTATING RESULTS.  NEXT, I SPOKE TO SOMEONE IN SALES WHO MADE A PHONE CALL TO \"DAN\" WHO IS APPARENTLY WORKS FOR TOYOTA?S SAFETY DEPARTMENT.  SIX DAYS LATER, WE WERE TOLD THAT TOYOTA HAD ONLY HEARD OF ONE OTHER CASE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE AND IT WAS RESOLVED. WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS ?NO RESOLUTION? AND TO TRY OTHER SEATS.   THE DEALERSHIP DID MAKE A TRIP TO THE LOCAL TARGET STORE TO LOOK AT SEATS AND MAKE SUGGESTIONS BUT NONE OF THEM WORKED.  WE MADE SEVERAL MORE ATTEMPTS WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WE COULD NOT FIND A SEAT THAT WOULD TIGHTEN SAFELY, EITHER WITH LATCH OR THE SEATBELT.  STEVEN TOYOTA ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE INSTALL THE SEAT IN THE FRONT BUT IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND EFFECTIVE JULY 1, A LAW IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA.  THE FOLLOWING SEATS WERE ATTEMPTED: BABY TREND FLEX LOC INFANT SEAT, COSCO SCENERA CONVERTIBLE SEAT, COSCO ALPHA OMEGA ELITE CONVERTIBLE/BOOSTER SEAT.  ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE NOTICED IS THAT IF A SEAT COULD BE INSTALLED, THE SEAT MUST LEAN AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FOR INFANTS TO RIDE.

SHE HAD TO BRAKE AS MUCH SHE COULD TO CONTROL THE CAR. SHE WAS ABLE TO PULL TO PULL OFF BUT STILL COULDN'T CONTROL THE ENGINE. THE ENGINE  DIDN'T EVEN SHUT DOWN WHEN TURNING THE KEY.  CHANGING THE SELECTOR LEVER  TO NEUTRAL WAS IMPOSSIBLE AS THE ENGINE TOOK FULL RPM.

YESTERDAY - SATURDAY 3/10 -   I WAS DRIVING THE TRUCK THE   FIRST TIME AFTER THE PREVIOUS INCIDENT. THERE WAS A SLOW DOWN IN THE TRAFFIC WHEN SUDDENLY THE ENGINE DID THE SAME AS ABOVE.  I WAS ON A MIDDLE LANE AND COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD. HAVING HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND SLOWING THE SPEED CAREFULLY I WAS ABLE STOP ON THE HIGHWAY W/O ANYBODY DRIVING ON US.

I STARTED THE CAR AND  PUSHING THE BRAKE PEDAL HARD I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE TRUCK AND DRIVE TO NEXT RED LIGHTS. AFTER SOME BRAKING AND RESTARTING THE CAR WAS AGAIN SUDDENLY BACK IN CONTROL.

THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I REAR ENDED A VEHICLE CAUSING $1500 DAMAGE TO THE TACOMA AND $1200 TO THE OTHER VEHICLE. I ALSO HAD A WITNESS THAT SAW MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AFTER IMPACT. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE ACCIDENT REPORTED TO TOYOTA CANADA AND THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION. A THIRD PARTY INVESTIGATOR/ENGINEERING WAS SENT TO CHECK THE VEHICLE AND FOUND NO ERROR CODES. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. TWO MONTHS LATER THE TRUCK LURCHED AGAIN AT AN INTERSECTION. THIS TIME I SHOVED THE TRUCK INTO NEUTRAL. I OBSERVED THE RPMS CLIMB TO 3000 RPM THEN DROP OFF. THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP (NORTHSIDE TOYOTA) CHECKED THE VEHICLE OVER AND SAID THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM. NOTE: THE VEHICLE HAD ROUGHLY 10,000 KILOMETERS AT THAT TIME. I ALSO FOUND MYSELF RIDING THE BRAKES MORE THEN I HAVE EVER ON ANY VEHICLE I'VE OWNED.  WE HAVE SINCE TRADED THE VEHICLE IN FOR A 2007 TACOMA THINKING THIS PROBLEM IS ONE OF A KIND ISSUE. I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP WHY I WAS TRADING IT IN. WE NO LONGER TRUSTED THE 2006. THEY HAD NO QUALMS DOING THE TRADE, OBVIOUSLY THINKING THERE WAS NO ISSUE. I TOOK A MAJOR HIT FOR DEPRECIATION ON A TRUCK THAT HAD ONE OIL CHANGE. THAT 2006 IS STILL SITTING ON THEIR LOT. TO SAY THE LEAST I AM NOT PLEASED, BUT DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO PURSUE THIS. ALSO THE STRESS GOT TO US. *JB",

STEPPED ON THE GAS WHEN THE CAR I WAS TRYING TO GET BY ACCELERATED.  TRUCK ACCELERATED RAPIDLY TO 75-90 MPH, STEPPED ON THE BRAKE TO RELEASE CRUISE CONTROL BUT TRUCK CONTINUED ACCELERATION.  IN FRONT OF TRUCK WAS SEMI, I HIT THE BRAKES TO CONTROL SPEED, BRAKES DID NOT WORK AS AUTOMATIC BRAKES BUT LIKE OLD BRAKES, PUT BOTH FEET ON BRAKES BUT TRUCK DID NOT SLOW DOWN AND CONTINUED AT 55 TO 65 MPH.  WENT INTO THE EMERGENCY LANE, PUT ON FLASHERS.  BRAKES WERE SMELLING AT THIS POINT.  PUT TRUCK INTO NEUTRAL AND TRUCK CONTINUED MOVING FORWARD AT EXCESSIVE SPEED.  PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE AND CONTINUED TO EXIT RAMP WHICH WAS VERY LONG.  FINALLY GOT OFF HIGHWAY AND TURNED THE KEY OFF.  TRUCK SMELLED BADLY FROM THE BRAKES.  WAITED ABOUT 10 MINUTES, CALLED SON  WHO CALLED TOYOTA.  I CAREFULLY PUT THE TRUCK IN DRIVE AND CRUISED INTO A GAS STATION, TURNED TRUCK OFF, EXITED VEHICLE.  SON CALLED BACK AND SAID TOYOTA SAID \"DO NOT DRIVE THE TRUCK\".  THEY SENT A TOW TRUCK TO PICK IT UP.  SON AND PARTNER GOT TO VEHICLE AND THE HUB CAPS WERE BURNING HOT FROM BRAKES BEING APPLIED.  TOYOTA DROVE VEHICLE FOR 111 MILES AND CHECKED EVERYTHING OUT AND FOUND NOTHING.  I CALLED TOYOTA AND HAVE STARTED ARBITRATION FOR THEM TO BUY BACK MY BRAND NEW TRUCK. *JB",
