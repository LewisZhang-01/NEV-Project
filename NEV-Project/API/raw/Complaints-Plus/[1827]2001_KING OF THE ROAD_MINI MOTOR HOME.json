        "summary": "ON MY 2006 KEYSTONE LAREDO FIFTH WHEEL RV, MODEL 29RL, THERE IS A 27INCH TELEVISION MOUNTED IN THE RIGHT REAR CABINET OF THIS REAR LIVING ROOM MODEL. IN JUNE, DURING NORMAL OPERATION, I WAS TRAVELING HOME ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THE TV HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE CABINET AND DESTROYED THE TV AND THE WIRING ATTACHED. SINCE IT IS LAWFUL TO TRAVEL IN THE RV WHILE UNDERWAY IN THIS STATE IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED BY THE FALLING  TV. ON INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE FACTORY INSTALLED TV HAD BEEN MOUNTED ON PLYWOOD USING DRYWALL SCREWS THAT WERE DRIVEN UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PLYWOOD AND INTO THE PLASTIC HOUSING OF THE TV. THE POINT AT WHICH THE SCREWS ENTERED THE TV HOUSING CRACKED THE HOUSING IN SUCH A WAY THAT A PERMANENT ATTACHMENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THUS THE TV WAS STTING UNSECURED AND LITERALLY AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I CONTACTED THE FACTORY (MR. CRAIG CROUCH) AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY IT WAS OF NO ITTEREST TO THEM.  I SUBMIT THAT SINCE THE WIRING OF THE TV WAS WRENCHED OUT OF THE CHASIS, POSING A FIRE HAZARD, AND THE FALLING AND ROLLING OF THE TV ITSELF COULD HAVE SEVERELY INJURED SOMEONE, A CHILD FOR INSTANCE, THAT A SAFETY RECALL IS IN ORDER FOR THE 60,000 UNITS SO CONFIGURED (MR. CROUCH'S FIGURES). PLEASE ADVISE ME OF YOUR ACTION.  J. CONTI  *TR",
