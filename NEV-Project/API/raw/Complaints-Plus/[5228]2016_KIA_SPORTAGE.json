Did so Kia said it was a turned or spun rod bearing. But denied to fix it because the knock sensor was not installed if I don't get a letter or a recall on it how was I suppose to know. As I done some research I see it's a very big problem with kia 2.4 l engines if it was a safety issue why was I not aware until this happened to my car.

I then heard a loud knocking noise and my vehicle would not go over 15 MPH. There was not a single light on my dashboard that came on to alert me of the situation. I had the car towed to the auto shop I use until I could contact KIA. Bob King Kia (where I bought this one new as well as two other cars previously) said I had to have it towed there and have a diagnostic ($130) completed before they could help me. on 1/4/22 I had it towed there. This was a SCAM as they told me my engine failure was due to a recall that was not completed that I was never notified about and they would nor KIA would cover anything. Brian(Service Manager) there offered to reach out to his KIA sales manager to see if he could get an exception. To my knowledge this never took place according to two other individuals and I was lied to. When he reached out on 1/24/22 to let me know it was a NO he also told me my car was broken into on 1/18/22 and I was not notified of this prior. So now I have a 2016 Kia Sportage that I still owe money on that wont run and a broken window I had to put a claim on my insurance for that even as of 2/10/22 has yet to be fixed. It is sad though that they offered to give me $500 for my car that I owe about $5000.00 on or I could trade it in on another KIA and they would pay my car off. It is all a sales gimmick and people are taken advantage of.",

I try to keep all my conversations via chat or email for this very reason i also have emails I\u2019ve communicated with corporate about the situation to which I had no response and most of the repairs that I got were at certified  kia service stations.

One day out of the blue it started making a knocking sound coming from engine, I contacted the Dealership they couldn't figure it out stating it was a known issue from the Back Rear seats locking latch not holding steady. I explained that it sounds like it's coming from front side of the vehicle in the engine. They advised me that I am okay so I took their word for it. Followed up on a routine Oil Service Change and again I advised the dealership to look into the knocking sound due to concerns that it doesn't seem right. My engine service lamps have never turned on but the sound has been a concern but once more the mechanic and service writer at the dealership assured me that their is nothing wrong explaining to me, it's just the A/C Ventilation Shutters underneath the front end of the vehicle it suddenly disabled itself and it's flapping when the vehicle is in motion making the knocking sound. I was in shock with what was said but they are the experts. Late 2020 just months later I arrive at the Dealership for my Oil Change was told by Service Writer that I have to perform their 30k Milestone Oil Service: Repl Engine Oil / Filter Inspection which cost $400 - $415.

UPON LOOKING OVER THE VEHICLE I COULD NOT SEE ANY ISSUES BUT DID NOTICE A CRACKLING SOUND. WHEN I LOOKED ON THE TOP OF THE CAR THE REAR SECTION OF THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF WAS SHATTERED IN EACH CORNER AND WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER I NOTICED IN THE CENTER IT WAS CRACKED AS WELL BUT WAS STILL BEING HELD TOGETHER. I DECIDED THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE THE CAR STRAIGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP (70 MILES AWAY). BY TIME I GOT THERE THE BACK PORTION OF THE SUNROOF LOOKED EVEN WORSE AND WAS STARTING TO CAVE IN. THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE AND THAT I NEEDED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH MY INSURANCE AS THEY WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY NOT COVER THIS UNDER MY WARRANTY OR EVEN MY EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I HAD PURCHASED. KEEP IN MIND I BOUGHT THIS ONLY 36 DAYS AGO, BRAND NEW OFF THE LOT. THE SERVICE MANAGER CLAIMED HE SAW A CHUNK OF METAL IN THAT PORTION OF THE SUNROOF AND CLAIMED THAT OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAD HIT IT. HOWEVER, AS I POINTED OUT TO HIM, THAT WAS NOT METAL AT ALL BUT SIMPLY A CHUNK OF GLASS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE FROM THE GLASS SLOWLY FALLING INWARD. THE CURRENT MILEAGE ON MY CAR IS 6,500 MILES. I HAVE ATTACHED 4 IMAGES. 3 ARE OF WHEN IT INITIALLY HAPPENED AND THE LAST ONE IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHEN I GOT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.",
