THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, I WAS VISITING ORLANDO FLORIDA. I TOOK THE SUV TO A DEALER, AND THEY SAID THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE ECM AND REPROGRAMMED IT. I LEFT BACK THE NEXT DAY FOR ATLANTA. NEARLY 80 MILES AWAY IN OCALA FLORIDA, IT STARTED DOING THIS AGAIN. I CALLED A TOW TRUCK, AND HAD IT TAKEN TO AN OCALA DEALERSHIP. THEY IN TURN TOLD ME IT WAS A BAD ECM, AND AFTER SPENDING AN ENTIRE DAY IN OCALA, I WAS BACK ON MY WAY TO ATLANTA. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, I HAD THIS OCCUR AGAIN. ONCE AGAIN I HAD IT TAKEN TO A DEALERSHIP IN ATLANTA. THEY RAN A COMPUTER DIAGNOSIS ON IT, AND SAID THEY HAD NO IDEA WHY IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS AN ECM PROBLEM, AS THE CODE COMING UP WAS DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH THE SENSOR IN THE FLOOR BOARD THAT READS THE DISTANCEOF THE GAS PEDAL FROM THE FLOOR BOARD. AS IT IS A DRIVE BY SENSOR VS DRIVE BY WIRE. THEY REPAIRED THIS, AND ALTHOUGH I FELT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, EVEN THOUGH I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AT THE TIME, THE FIRST  TWO INCIDENTS THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY DIAGNOSED WRONG WERE DONE SO WHILE UNDER WARRANTY. THEY ENDED UP CUTTING THE COSTS IN HALF. I HAD NO CHOICE, AS I NEEDED MY VEHICLE BACK. NOW IT HAS OCCURRED THE FORTH TIME. I HAVE RESORTED TO THE INTERNET TO SEE IF OTHER ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. WHAT I'M FINDING THROUGH THIS RESEARCH, IT SOUNDS AS IF MANY HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE, AND IT SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE THROTTLE BODY. WHILE RESEARCHING, I WAS ALERTED TO THIS SITE, THUS THE REASON I'M POSTING HERE.

THEY ADVISED THE CRACK WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING SO HARSH, ALSO THE SHIFTING PROBLEM WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE SENSOR MALFUNCTION AND THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE THROTTLE TO THE TRANSMISSION. THEY REPLACED THE MOUNT & SENSORS. CHARGED ME $700. LEFT THE DEALERSHIP, 15 MINS LATER THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON! I TOOK IT STRAIGHT BACK AND DAYS LATER THEY CALLED...COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, THE CODE AGAIN WAS FOR THE SENSORS, THEY INSTALLED AGAIN &  CHECKED THE SOLENOIDS BUT THEY WERE FINE. THEY ADVISED A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS NEEDED & WOULD BE $2400. WITH NO WARRANTY, I COULDN'T AFFORD THE REPAIR, SO I HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT UNTIL I CAME UP $$. IT STILL SHIFTS HORRIBLE AND OFTEN 'REVS' WHILE ACCELERATING BUT WON'T SHIFT FROM 2ND-3RD. THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON, I HAVE TO PULL OVER, TURN IT OFF 20 MINS BEFORE IT WILL DRIVE. A DAY OR TWO LATER THE ENGINE LIGHT WILL GO OFF, BUT WILL RANDOMLY APPEAR AGAIN WHEN THE 'NO GO' HAPPENS AGAIN.  AFTER 'GOOGLING' THE SYMPTOMS, THERE'S SEVERAL FORUMS STATING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES! I'M AFRAID THIS WILL HAPPEN WHILE MERGING ON THE HWY OR AT AN INTERSECTION. THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE CAR I'VE OWNED & I'M IN SHOCK A VEHICLE THAT COST ME 50K WOULD END UP THE WORST CAR I'VE OWNED. THE TRANSMISSION IS THE ONLY SAFETY ISSUE I HAVE, BUT SINCE I'VE HAD THE CAR, I'VE REPLACED 3 DOOR HANDLES, IT SHAKES AROUND 60MPH, THE BACK PASSENGER DOOR WON'T OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE & THE LOCKS INTERMITTENTLY WORK, BOTH CAPS ON THE AUX OUTLETS CAME OFF AFTER 6 MOS ALONG W/ THE PAINT ON THE A/C CONTROLS.

ONE OF THE EDGE PLANES HAS A RELIEF CUT  WHICH ACTS AS A TRAP AS VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THE DOOR ELIMINATES THE OPTION OF PULLING BACK A FINGER OR SMALL HAND.  IF YOU WERE TO SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, OPEN DOOR AND EXIT AS ONE NORMALLY WOULD, SIMPLY DROPPING YOUR ARM STRAIGHT DOWN PUTS YOUR HAND(FINGERS) AT RISK.  THE ONLY REASON HIS THUMB WAS NOT SEVERED IS BECAUSE THE CHILDREN EXITING THE CAR STOPPED OPENING THE DOOR AND CLOSED IT SO HE COULD TAKE HIS THUMB OUT.  HAD THE DOOR OPENED ALL THE WAY HIS THUMB WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST.  AS IT REMAINS WE SPENT SEVERAL HOURS IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM, HE HAD TO HAVE 4 STITCHES AND AN XRAY.  BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE JOINT NO BONES WHERE BROKEN.   A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT THAT VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. *TR",

IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARING AND ONSTAR CALLS TO SEE IF I WAS OKAY. MANY REPORTS FROM ONSTAR ALSO CONFIRM THIS. AFTER MANY TRIPS TO SUN PONTIAC THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAD REFUSED TO ISSUE ME A REPAIR ORDER BECAUSE YUKONS WERE HAVING EXPLOSIVE CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY MINE. I CALLED GM AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER HAD ANY SUCH PROBLEM AND REFERRED ME TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WHERE THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN. I WAS ORDERED NOT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND HAVE IT TOWED FROM MY HOME BECAUSE OF THE SAME EXPLOSIVE CONDITION. SINCE JUNE 2009 I HAVE HAD OVER 300 PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH GM. I PERSONALLY WITNESSED THE ENTIRE REAR END UNDERCARRIAGE OF MY VEHICLE IN PIECES. I HAVE READ AND BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THAT EVEN AFTER THEY REPLACED HARNESSES, GAS TANKS, TUBES, GAS LINES ETC. IT COULD NOT BE FIXED. THE LAST WORDS OUT OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT SUN WAS THAT \" I WOULDN'T DRIVE THAT CAR IF I WERE YOU BECAUSE IT MIGHT BLOW UP\". I KNEW THAT GM WOULD NEVER ADMIT TO ANY OF THIS SO I TAPED MOST OF MY CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF THEIR HEAD OFFICIALS AND STORED NUMEROUS COPIES WITH TWO SEPARATE ATTORNEY'S, MY FAMILY AND ONE COUSIN WHO WORKS FOR THE MEDIA IN CASE ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN. IT WAS ADMITTED TO ME A GM THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME AND IT WOULDN'T BE THE LAST.

ONE OF THESE CONTROLS IS SUPPOSE TO ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE THE DISC THAT IS PLAYING TO ANOTHER ONE OF THE SIX THAT YOU HAVE LOADED INTO THE CHANGER. ON SOME OF THESE TRUCKS THE WRONG WIRING HARNESS WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE TRUCK WAS BUILT ALONG WITH THE WRONG SOFTWARE BEING LOADED INTO THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THIS PREVENTS THIS CONTROL FROM FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY. INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE DISC THAT IS PLAYING, IT SIMPLE GOES TO THE NEXT SONG ON THAT SAME CD. THERE IS ALREADY A CONTROL ON THE STEERING COLUMN TO DO THIS. WHEN I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP HE  SAID AT FIRST THAT THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL MODULE WAS BAD AND THEN THAT THE RADIO WAS DEFECTIVE. BOTH ITEMS WERE REPLACED AND THE PROBLEM REMAINS. HE THEN CHECKED SOME OF THE OTHER YUKON DENALIS THAT HE HAD IN STOCK AND TOLD ME THAT ON SOME OF THESE CARS THE CONTROLS WORKED PROPERLY AND ON SOME THEY DID NOT. HE THEN TOLD ME ABOUT THE WIRING HARNESS AND SOFTWARE PROBLEM. GM'S POSITION IS THAT THESE CARS ARE BUILT PROPERLY AND THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. PAGE 336 OF THE OWNERS MANUAL CLEARLY SAYS THAT THIS BUTTON SHOULD CHANGE THE DISC THAT IS PLAYING. I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW WHEN YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DISC YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD AND LOOK DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE DASHBOARD AND LOCATE A SMALL 1/4\" BY 1/2\"  BUTTON AND PUSH IT. THIS CAN CAUSE YOU TO DRIFT OUT OF YOUR LANE OF TRAVEL, ESPECIALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THIS, AFTER ALL, IS A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR RADIOS-YOU CAN KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD.

MOST OF THE TIME DURING DAYTIME/SUNNY CONDITIONS YOU CAN NOT JUST GLANCE AT THE INSTRUMENTS TO READ THEM.  YOU HAVE TO DIVERT YOUR ATTENTION FOR 2 OR MORE SECONDS TO READ EVEN THE SPEEDOMETER (WHICH IS THE EASIEST TO READ).  ALL INSTRUMENTS HAVE BLACK FACES WITH WHITE MARKINGS WHICH ARE LEGIBLE DAY AND NIGHT.  THE DAYTIME VISUAL RECOGNITION PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY TWO CONDITIONS. 1)  RED POINTERS THAT DO NOT CONTRAST SUFFICIENTLY WITH THE BLACK FACE, AND 2) DASH COWLING SHADING/GLARE PROBLEMS.  THE TOP LEFT (OIL PRESSURE) AND TOP RIGHT (VOLTMETER) GAUGES ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO READ.  THE BOTTOM RIGHT (COOLANT TEMP) IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ.  THE BOTTOM LEFT (FUEL) IS DIFFICULT TO VERY DIFFICULT TO READ.  THE TWO LARGE CENTER GAUGES (TACHOMETER AND SPEEDOMETER) ARE DIFFICULT TO READ.    THE TIME / ATTENTION REQUIRED TO READ THESE GAUGES PRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE YOU ARE FORCED TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR FAR TO LONG (OR TO KEEP REPEATING LOOKS TO CHECK YOUR SPEED / FUEL STATUS.  I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2007 GMC YUKON AND MADE A ROAD TRIP OF 3000 MILES. TWO DRIVERS HAD SIMILAR VISUAL RECOGNITION PROBLEMS DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS. I GAVE UP EVEN TRYING TO READ THE OTHER GAUGES.    IF YOU WEAR SUNGLASSES YOU HAVE TO LIFT THEM TO TRY TO READ THE GAUGES.  THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO (HAVE TO DO) TO LESSEN THE VISUAL RECOGNITION PROBLEM.  1) TURN ON THE LIGHTS (PROVIDES MINIMAL DASH ILLUMINATION), 2) CLOSE THE SUNROOF SHADE (REDUCES GLARE), AND 3) PLACE YOU HAND ABOVE YOUR EYES AS A SHIELD (REDUCES GLARE).    I HAVE TALKED TO THE GM DEALER TO SEE IF THEY COULD INCREASE ILLUMINATION ON THE DASH LIGHTING.  (THAT WOULD STILL MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS DURING THE DAY.)
