History I-- Prior to July 2021, never heard this noise. Beginning in mid-July 2021 with a mileage of approximately 3400 miles, the radio would blare full volume upon starting the vehicle. This occurred sporadically at first, but the event would happen more often as time went by.   The protocol used for shutting down the vehicle is as follows: a.Place gear shifter in Park. b.Engage electronic brakes. c.Completely turn off Climate system. dCompletely turn off Entertainment Console (Audio, et cetera). c.Turn off exterior lights. f.Turn off engine. g.Remove FOB with person. h.Exit vehicle and shut door(s). i.Engage locking and alarm systems twice with FOB.  The Settings for the Vehicle Sounds is zero volume and no button feedback.  Therefore, the radio should NOT activate except when engaged manually, and certainly not when the vehicle is starting and certainly not at full volume.  The vehicle was taken to Parks Chevrolet on Wednesday, 29 September 2021, where the Service Department retained the vehicle for two days trying to diagnosis this issue. We picked up the vehicle Thursday afternoon, 30 September 2021.   Friday morning, 1 October 2021, the vehicle was used, and upon starting, the radio blared at full volume for several seconds. The vehicle was not used Saturday. Sunday, 3 October 2021, the vehicle was used for a short trip to Eastern Henrico County's Osborne Landing. Although the radio did not blare when first starting the vehicle, it did blare for several seconds at the boat landing having sat for an hour.   The vehicle was used only three times during the week of 4 October through 10 October 2  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

While using Carplay for hands-free operation of a cellular device and or navigation the system will reboot continuously. Just prior to the system failures to begin the turn signals will begin to operate sporadically.  They will either stay on solid, off, or blink at an uneven interval. These system reboots create a safety issue as this forces the driver to take their eyes off of the road and physically disconnect and reconnect the cellular device.   By having to take my eyes off of the road to deal with the system rebooting this takes attention away and creates a safety issue for myself and all others on the road. One incident I had to slam on the brakes after looking back up and seeing that traffic had come to a sudden stop.  The unit has been replaced by the dealership one time thus far and the BCM computer has been replaced once as well. This has not resolved the issues. This is also not limited to my specific vehicle. There are hundreds of other owners reporting the same issues.  The problem was reproduced by one technician at the dealership but has not been reproduced by them since.

While turning from the stop sign on to the highway, the vehicle vehicle hesitated mid-shift and I lost acceleration. After a few seconds, a loud clunk was then heard, the truck jerked - throwing me forward, and acceleration was restored. This delay resulted in a near-miss collision as there was an approaching vehicle headed southbound and I was stuck in their lane since my vehicle was not accelerating.  Issue reported to Heartland Chevrolet (501 Rte 291, Liberty, MO 64068) to document and  investigate the issue. Vehicle taken to dealer next day. After 3 days of service, the dealer service team could not reproduce the issue and escalated to regional GM engineer (Service Manager called him directly.). Engineer stated that hesitation is normal.  Still an on-going issue; work around has been to let the vehicle idle longer before driving on a cold start. Sometimes you can \"feel\" the hesitation and know when to let off the gas pedal few a few seconds until the shift in to 2nd to avoid the vehicle throwing you forward, being able to have better \"control\" of the hesitation issue.",

IT'S NOT JUST THE DRIVERS OF THE TRUCK WHO ARE IN DANGER, OTHER DRIVERS, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS  ARE ALSO IN DANGER. A FATALITY IS IMMINENT BUT I ASK THE NHTSA HOW MANY FATALITIES BEFORE THIS DANGEROUS VEHICLE IS TAKEN OFF THE ROAD? EVERY SAFETY DEVICE ON THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN RECALLED: AIRBAGS, SEATBELT, AND BRAKE SYSTEMS. THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO BRAKE ARE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT IS REPORTED HERE.  PLEASE DON'T EXPECT GM TO FIX THIS ISSUE WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CAUSE BEHIND THE PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH! FIRST IT WAS ONSTAR, NOW IT IS THE COMPANY THEY HIRED TO CREATE THEIR COMPUTERIZED BRAKES. COMPUTERS HAVING SO MUCH CONTROL OVER VEHICLES, I'M LEARNING, IS NOT SAFE.

SECOND TIME, DEALER POINTED TO A TSP THAT INDICATED THE SYSTEM WAS BUSY WHEN FIRST STARTING THE VEHICLE AND TO ALLOW FOR EXTRA TIME TO PLACE VEHICLE IN REVERSE.  ISSUE IS NOT RELATED TO PLACING THE CAR IN GEAR, IT ONLY SHOWS THE ISSUE.  ISSUE APPEARS TO BE A SOFTWARE ISSUE IN WHICH THE SYSTEM DOESN'T GET BOOTED UP IN A TIMELY MANNER.  AFTER SOME TIME, HAS BEEN RANDOM FROM 2-3 MINUTES TO OVER 30 MINUTES, THE SYSTEM WILL EVENTUALLY COME ONLINE AND WORK PROPERLY.  THE ISSUE I HAVE IS MANY OF MY TRIPS ARE JUST A FEW MINUTES UP THE ROAD TO MY FIREHOUSE I VOLUNTEER AT.  THE TRUCK DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETELY BOOT UP THE CAMERA SYSTEM AND I'M LEFT WITH A BLUE SCREEN WITH NO WAY TO RESET IT OR USE THE CAMERAS.  I'VE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER AND CHEVROLET AND CHEVROLET INITIALLY CALLED BACK WANTING ME TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE WOULD INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE AND CALL ME BACK TO SCHEDULE A FIX.  NO WORD IN OVER 1 MONTH NOW.  I SEE ON SEVERAL FORUMS OTHER USERS STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND SO FAR THERE SEEMS TO BE NO FIX.  I'M NOT SURE GM KNOWS WHAT THE ISSUE IS AT THIS POINT.  THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY TO ALERT THEM AND GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE WORKING ON THE ISSUE.  HOPING THIS VENUE WILL BE ABLE TO WAKE SOMEONE UP AT GM.  ISSUE IS CONSISTENTLY RANDOM.

THE FIRST TIME BACKING UP IN MY DRIVEWAY I NOTICED THE BACKUP CAMERA FLICKERED EVERYTIME I TOUCHED THE BRAKE PEDAL. I REPEATED BACKING UP SEVERAL TIMES AND AT ONE POINT THE BACKUP CAMERA FLICKERED AND WENT OFF (SCREEN WENT BLANK/BLACK WITH A MESSAGE \"SERVICE REAR VISION SYSTEM\". WHEN THE BACKUP CAMERA CAME BACK ON THE GUIDELINES FOR BACKING UP HAD DISAPPEARED. I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE GUIDELINES BACK ON THE SCREEN UNTIL I CHANGED THE SHIFTER TO DRIVE OR PARK THEN BACK INTO REVERSE. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE BACKUP CAMERA SCREEN REPEATEDLY FLICKERS AND INTERMITTENTLY WILL GO BLANK WITH A LOSS OF GUIDELINES. I CONTACTED CHEVROLET AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON 4/1/19. THEIR REPORT WAS THAT THE SYSTEM DID IN FACT FLICKER AND THE SCREEN SHUT OFF MOMENTARILY HOWEVER STATED IT IS \"NORMAL\" FOR THESE VEHICLE. THEY GAVE ME A 2019 SILVERADO LOANER WITH THE SAME ACCESSORY PACKAGE AND THAT CAMERA DID THE SAME THING. THE DEALER NOTED THAT THEY TESTED MULTIPLE SIMILAR MODEL VEHICLES AND THEY ALL PERFORMED THE SAME WAY. THE DEALER MENTIONED IT OCCURRING ON THE MODEL WITH THE SMALLER DISPLAY SCREEN AND THAT THIS ISSUE WAS NOT OCCURRING WITH THE LARGER DISPLAY SCREEN. MY CONCERN IS HAVING CHILDREN IF BACKING UP AND THE SCREEN MOMENTARILY BLANKS OUT I LOSE REAR BACKUP CAMERA VISION CAUSING A POTENTIALLY FATAL CATASTROPHE. THE DEALER SAID THEY ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AT THIS TIME. THE VEHICLE STARTED DOING THIS WITH LESS THAN 20MILES ON IT AND NOW WITH APPROXIMATELY 300 MILES ON IT THE ISSUE CONTINUES. I AM CONCERNED THAT A FATAL ACCIDENT COULD OCCUR. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS ISSUE BE RESOLVED AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FOR GM TO FIX THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!",
