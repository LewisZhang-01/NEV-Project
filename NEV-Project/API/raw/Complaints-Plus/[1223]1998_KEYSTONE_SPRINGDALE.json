        "summary": "HAD 3,000 MILES ON OUR CAMPER BEFORE OUR TRIP TO COLORADO.  CAMPER WAS INSPECTED PRIOR TO OUR TRIP AND TIRES SHOWED FAIRLY NORMAL WEAR.  IT WAS INSPECTED AT WIDE WORLD RV IN WILKES BARRE PA. PHONE 570-825-4553.  AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM OUR TRIP TO COLORADO I HAD NOTICE THE RIGHT REAR TIRE ON THE CAMPER TO BE WORN THREW THE STEEL CORDS ON ONLY THE INSIDE 20% OF THE TIRE.  THE FRONT ONE IS STILL LIKE NEW.  HOWEVER THE 2 TIRES ON THE RIGHT SIDE ARE WORN APPROX. 40% ON THE INSIDE 20% OF THE TIRE.  UPON LIFTING THE TRAILER THERE IS MUCH MORE THAN NORMAL PLAY IN THE WHEELS.  I'M ASUMING THE BEARINGS WERN'T ASSEMBLED PROPERLY, BUT CAN'T GAURENTEE THIS.  WE CONTACTED THE COMPANY WHO MAKES THE CAMPER.  INTIALLY THEY RESPOND AND ASSIGNED SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF ME.  HOWEVER, I ASSUME SINCE RECIEVING MY LETTER VIA MAIL THEY HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND TO THIS PROBLEM.  I DID SEND THEM A BRIEF DISCRIPTION OF MY PROBLEM VIA EMAIL.  I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENDED IF BOTH TIRES ON ONE SIDE WERE TO BLOW, COULD I HAVE CONTROL MY VECHILCE?  COULD WE HAVE LOST OUR LIVES?  I'M ACTUALLY AFRAID TO USE MY CAMPER RIGHT KNOW, NOT KNOWING THE PROBLEM AND HAVING MORE TROUBLE WITH GETTING THIS CORRECTED IF I DARE MOVE THIS CAMPER AGAIN.  NOT SURE WHO MAKES THESE AXLES AND ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES MAY USE THIS STYLE AXLE.  THIS COULD BECOME A SEVER DANGER TO SOMEONE ELSES FAMILY.",
