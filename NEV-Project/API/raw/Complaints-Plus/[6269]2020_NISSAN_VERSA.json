IN THE PAST... Nissan determined the wrong combination of metals was used in the side airbag sensor connector harness, causing oxidation on the pins of the airbag control unit harness connection. The oxidation on the connector pins can cause a short loss of communication from the satellite sensor to the airbag control unit.The Nissan Versa curtain and seat-mounted side airbag system will enter a backup mode when signal loss occurs and this backup mode allows the curtain and seat-mountain side airbags to deploy as intended in a crash. However, the backup mode that kicks in from signal loss changes the requirements that must be met for the airbags to deploy, so simply slamming the doors can activate the airbags. Typically the force needed to activate the airbags can only come from someone slamming a door from the outside, but real hazards exist if occupant is inside the car when airbags deploy.",

It will happen randomly, in any sort of weather, and the sensor warnings will stay on for different amounts of time during each incident. Having the sensors randomly go off while driving is incredibly distracting, not to mention completely unsafe and useless. Along with the sensor issues, the AEB will spontaneously stop my vehicle and not allow me to brake it hot the gas. This is notable mainly when reversing. Just this morning I was completely unable to back out of my driveway because the AEB system kept automatically braking and preventing me from being out (though there was absolutely nothing moving or in the way.)",

You can be driving down the road whether it be sunshine or raining and no cars are around you and all of a sudden these sensor lights come on and my car slows down as if trying to avoid a collision.  I have purchased 4 vehicles over the past several years from this same dealership and this one has given me trouble.  I had to beg for them to give me a rental car so they could check my car out Monday and then they called me Tuesday late afternoon to come get my car because they couldn't fix it and it's under engineering review to figure out how to resolve this issue.  This is the 2nd time they have given me this excuse.  I called Nissan Corporate 800 number and complained and this man from Consumer Affairs who was very rude kept telling me there was nothing they could do and they weren't going to buy back my car and that I would just have to take it back to the Dealership and they would have to figure it out on how to fix the issue and that a letter would be going out to them and that I would need to contact them on if they received the letter or not. I have photos and videos of the sensor light issues and have given them to Fred Haas Nissan to review and again nothing has been done.  I am back in this car still having the issue and Nissan doesn't want to keep the car and give me a rental until they can come up with a solution to fix the issue.
