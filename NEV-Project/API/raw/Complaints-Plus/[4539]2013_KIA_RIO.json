The vehicle shuts off and stalls while idling at stop lights, stop signs or slow traffic with no warning. All other powered components like radio, lights etc remain on and functioning. The car is hard to start after the vehicle shuts off and has stalled and takes multiple tries to turn over. When accelerating the vehicle will randomly not respond at all to the gas pedal, will not increase speed, RPM will not move and the car will not respond. When the car does accelerate, it will sputter and rpm will increase dramatically. This is very dangerous to those driving and those on the road. If the vehicle does not respond to acceleration the risk to the driver and occupants is serious. There could be an accident from oncoming traffic both rear and from behind. There is great life threatening risk. Local mechanic stated the car throws no codes when diagnosed, and there is no check engine light on. Kia knows their vehicles have this issue and has recalled many other models in the same years. There are multiple identical NHTSA.GOV complaints noting identical vehicle problems. The problem is not able to be found with diagnostic. The KIA RIO should be recalled and repaired immediately. The car was sold with serious safety issues. There was a class action even that did not proceed that alleges the gamma engines cause sudden stalling, excessive oil consumption, engine failures and fires in the vehicles.",

THIS SUPPOSED ENGINE OVERHEAT WARNING LIGHT NEVER COMES ON DURING THE LIGHT BULB CHECK PHASE, SO THAT THE OPERATION OF ITS LIGHT BULB CANNOT BE VERIFIED. NOTE THAT THE OTHER WARNING LIGHTS, OIL PRESSURE, BRAKES, ETC COME ON DURING THIS PHASE AND THEIR WARNING SYSTEMS CAN BE VERIFIED. IF THE OVERHEAT LIGHT BULB FILAMENT BURNS OUT (THIS FREQUENTLY HAPPENS WITH ANY BULB), THEN THE DRIVER IS NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO VERIFY THE BULBS OPERATION, AND THIS ENGINE OVERHEAT WARNING SYSTEM BECOMES USELESS AS THERE CANNOT BE ANY WARNING INDICATION EVER GIVEN TO THE DRIVER IF THE ENGINE DOES OVERHEAT.  A LIKELY RESULT OF THIS DEFECTIVE ENGINE OVERHEAT WARNING SYSTEM MAY BE A VEHICLE CRASH AT HIGH SPEED, WHEREBY THE DRIVER IS NEVER GIVEN AN OVERHEATED ENGINE WARNING IF ITS WARNING SYSTEMS LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT, THE ENGINE SHATTERS FROM EXCESSIVE HEAT, THE HOOD AND ENGINE FLUIDS FLY INTO THE WINDSHIELD BLOCKING THE DRIVERS VIEW, THE DRIVER LOSES CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, AND THE KIA VEHICLE CRASHES OFF THE ROAD OR INTO OTHER VEHICLES.
