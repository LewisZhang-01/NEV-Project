INITIALLY IT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER DRIVING ON HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT 1-1.5 HOURS. NOW IT BEGINS WITHIN THE 10 MILES IT TAKES TO DRIVE TO PICK UP RENTAL CAR.  THREE TIMES THUS FAR I HAVE BEEN NEARLY REAR ENDED, ONCE BY A TRACTOR TRAILER WHOSE WHEELS I CAN STILL HEAR SCREECHING BECAUSE THE CAR WOULDN'T ACCELERATE COMING OFF AN EXIT.  THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO STOP THE CAR IN ITS 'TRACKS' TO TRY TO GET THE TRANSMISSION TO CATCH. I TOLD NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR THAT CAR ISN'T SAFE TO DRIVE AS WELL AS NISSAN.  NEITHER WILL EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE EXISTS INCLUDING REFUSING TO VIEW VIDEOS I TOOK TO DEMONSTRATE THE ISSUE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO 3 DIFFERENT NISSAN DEALERSHIPS.  ONE IN NY SAID THE ISSUE WAS BEING CAUSED BY AN ACCESS, A QUART PLUS OVERFULL, OF TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THE SAID IT WOULD SELF ADJUST AFTER 2000-3000 MILES.  FIRST 300 MILES FROM NY TO DC CAR DROVE NORMALLY.  ON RETURN TRIP, SAME ISSUE, WITHIN 1-1.5 HRS TRANSMISSION STARTED TO HESITATE, CAR WOULDN'T ACCELERATE.  CAR ALSO HAS ELECTRICAL ISSUES WHICH CAUSE CONSOLE TO RANDOMLY RESET ITSELF.  AND A NAUSEATING SMELL THAT PERVADES THE CAR WHICH INITIALLY WAS NOTICED WHEN I TURNED THE HEAT/DEFROST ON BUT NOW SITTING HERE WRITING THIS, I CAN SMELL THE ORDER IN MY HAIR; I THINK IT'S SOME SORT OF EXHAUST SMELL.  NISSAN RESPONSE TO THE SMELL WHICH I INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS MAYBE ANTIFREEZE WAS THAT \"YOU WILL SMELL SOME ANTIFREEZE.  YOU'RE JUST SENSITIVE SMELLS\".      I HAVE NO DOCUMENTS TO UPLOAD OTHER THAN SERVICE RECORDS WHICH SHOWS NO REPAIRS PERFORMED.      I LITERALLY JUST TEXTED A FRIEND TO BORROW MONEY TO BUY A USED A CAR BECAUSE THE MORE I DRIVE THE CAR THE WORSE IT GETS AND I FEAR AN ACCIDENT WILL ENSUE CAUSING HARM TO MYSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE.",
