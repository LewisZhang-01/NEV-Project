TO KEEP WARRANTY INTACT ON THE CAR, HYUNDAI INSISTED THAT THE WIRING HARNESS ON THE CAR BE REPLACED, WHICH I DID FOR APPROXIMATELY $5000. SINCE THEN, I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC ITEMS GO BAD IN THE CAR. I REPLACED SOME OF THESE AT MY OWN EXPENSE. BUT THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE WITH SOME EXPENSIVE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS GOING BAD OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS.     IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THESE COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT GO BAD OVER THE LIFE OF THE CAR, AND CERTAINLY NOT AT A FREQUENCY THAT THEY HAVE FAILED IN MY CAR. I ATTRIBUTE THESE FAILURES TO BAD/DEFECTIVE JOB DONE DURING WIRING HARNESS REPLACEMENT. BUT HYUNDAI HAS REFUSED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY SINCE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.    BELOW IS A LIST OF THE BAD COMPONENTS, APPROXIMATE DATE OF THE COMPONENT GOING BAD, WHETHER IT IS REPLACED/FIXED AND APPROXIMATE EXPENSE TO FIX THEM    1. TELESCOPIC STEERING WHEEL--2015--REPAIRED AS PART OF WARRANTY  2. POWER SWITCH ASSEMBLY DRIVER'S SEAT--JAN 2016--$236.19--PAID OUT-OF-POCKET TO GET IT REPLACED  3.

ISSUE:  UNEXPECTEDLY, THE BRAKES BECAME \"SQUISHY\" (I.E. BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSED A LONG DISTANCE BEFORE ENGAGING BRAKES).  ADVISED BY HYUNDAI DEALER THAT IT IS A FAULTY HECU UNIT AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR $3,800.    NOTE:  THE BRAKE FLUID WAS REPLACED IN APRIL 2013 AND THE HECU UNIT WAS SUPPOSEDLY INSPECTED IN JANUARY 2014.  I BELIEVE THESE WERE DONE IN RESPONSE TO PRIOR RECALLS.    THAT SAID, UPON SOME FURTHER READING ON THE INTERNET, I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WHEN THIS PROBLEM WAS PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FOR RECALL, THE RECALL SHOULD HAVE RESULTED IN MY HECU UNIT BEING REPLACED, NOT JUST INSPECTED.    I INTEND TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND, HOPEFULLY, HYUNDAI WILL STAND BEHIND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HECU UNIT WITHOUT CHARGING ME.",

WHEN NEEDING TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY FROM A STOP, THIS CAR HAS A SECONDS GAP FROM HITTING THE GAS TO THE CAR MOVING. I'VE ALMOST BEEN HIT TWICE BECAUSE OF IT.  2) THE HEADLIGHTS SWITCH OFF INTERMITTENTLY WHEN USING THE TURN SIGNALS TO CHANGE LANES OR TURN. THEY FLASH ONCOMING DRIVERS AS I CLICK DOWN TO TURN THEM ON BEFORE THE TURN, OR WHEN THE TURN SIGNAL CLICKS BACK AFTER THE TURN. THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON. THE LIGHTS HAVE SHUT OFF COMPLETELY FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS WHILE I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY, IMPAIRING MY ABILITY TO SEE AT NIGHT. I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY PULL OVER ON THE FREEWAY IN AN UNSAFE LOCATION TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF, THEN TURN THEM BACK ON TO CLEAR THE PROBLEM. 3) MY VEHICLE HAD THE BRAKE SWITCH REPLACED FROM THE 2013 RECALL. HOWEVER, PRESSING THE BRAKE STILL DOES NOT SHUT OFF THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY.  I HAVE TO MANUALLY TURN IT OFF FROM THE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I LOVE THIS CAR, BUT I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CHILDREN IN IT IF THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT ADDRESSED. THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE AND IT IS GOING TO KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURE PEOPLE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AND ISSUE THE APPROPRIATE RECALLS.   *TR",

I TRIED TO BRAKE THE MOST I COULD BUT DID NOT MAKE IT SO SLAMMED INTO VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. IT WAS A VERY HARD IMPACT AND NONE OF THE AIRBAGS IN THE VEHICLE WENT OFF, SO DUE TO THE WHIPLASH MY MOUTH HIT THE STEERING WHEEL AND BROKE MY BOTTOM LIP. I HAD MY SEAT BELT ON SO NO OTHER INJURIES OCCURRED BESIDES MY ANKLE SPRAIN FROM THE JAM OF THE ACCELERATOR WITH THE CENTER CONSOLE. AS SOON AS THE CRASH OCCURRED THE CAR STARTED GOING INTO SMOKE SO I WAS SCARED AND DECIDED TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE BEFORE IT MIGHT BLOW UP. I FORCED MYSELF OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND PUT THE CAR IN THE GEAR OF PARK AND NO LONGER THAN TWO SECONDS LATER THAT I WAS OUT OF THE CAR, THE CAR STARTED TO HEAD IN REVERSE ON ITS OWN QUICKLY! I DID NOT EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO CLOSE THE DOOR SINCE I HAD JUST JUMPED OUT AND WENT ONTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND CROSSED THE MEDIAN AND WENT ACROSS TRAFFIC ONTO THE INCOMING TRAFFIC SIDE AND DID NOT STOP UNTIL IT HIT A WOODEN FENCE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAD HAPPEN THAT IT WAS ON PARK AND WENT REVERSE ON ITS OWN, IT WAS NOT SAFE AT ALL! THE VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED ALL OVER AND BROKE THE PROPERTY FENCE OF THE PUBLIC PARK. PARTS ARE BEING REPLACED AND THE CAR IS IN THE BODY SHOP TO BE FIXED.  *TR",

ON NUMEROUS OTHER OCCASIONS THE ABS HAS BEEN ENGAGED  WHEN MAKING A TURN INTO A SLIGHTLY RAISED DRIVEWAY, BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BRAKES ACTUALLY LOCK; I AM ABLE TO DRIVE THROUGH THE BRAKING ACTION.  THE HYUNDAI FIELD SERVICE REP DROVE MY CAR AND WAS UNABLE TO GET THE BRAKES TO LOCK, HOWEVER, ON AT LEAST FOUR OCCASIONS HE GOT THE ABS TO ENGAGE WHILE ENTERING A DRIVEWAY, ACCOMPANIED BY LOUD GRINDING NOISES.  HE STATED THAT THIS WAS \"NORMAL OPERATION DUE TO DRIVEWAY SLOPE ANGLE COMBINED WITH WHEEL BASE AND SUSPENSION CHARACTERISTICS.\"  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE COULD GET EVERY GENESIS COUPE ON THE LOT TO DO THE SAME THING. THEREFORE, THEY FELT NO REPAIRS WERE WARRANTED EVEN THOUGH I HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE BRAKES HAD ACTUALLY LOCKED UP, PLACING ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  A RECENT AUTOBLOG.COM ARTICLE NOTED THE SEVERE DEFICIENCIES IN THE HYUNDAI GENESIS COUPE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL THAT MIRROR MY OWN EXPERIENCE. *TR",
