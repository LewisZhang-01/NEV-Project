The shadow-line makes it look like I'm driving into the bat-cave.  I have observed on some online Kia Sorento user forums of the same complaint.  My Kia dealer claims that this is a factory design and there is no remedy.  I have uploaded 3 photos taken from inside the car parked in front of my white garage door.

I JOINED THE KIA FORUM TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE REPORTED THIS HAPPENING AND FOUND THAT SEVERAL OWNERS HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT. THEY ALL SAY THAT THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THE VEHICLE IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. WE NOW OWN A CAR THAT WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SPORADICALLY AND YOU CANNOT PREDICT WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I CALLED JIM SHORKEY KIA AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN HOW ELECTRIC THROTTLE CONTROLS (FLY-BY-WIRE) OPERATE. THAT IS GARBAGE BECAUSE OUR 2011 EQUINOX AND MY 2014 CADILLAC CTS SPORTWAGON ARE BOTH FLY BY WIRE AND NEITHER OF THEM HAS EVER EXHIBITED THIS PHENOMENON. WHEN JIM SHORKEY CHECKED FOR CODES AND DROVE THE CAR FOR 11 MILES THEY TOLD ME THAT THE NEW 8-SPEED TRANSMISSION MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM BUT THERE NO PROGRAMMING UPDATES FOR IT YET. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CARS HAVING WORKED AS A MECHANIC FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND AM POSITIVE THAT THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I BELIEVE IT TO BE IN THE REDUNDANT APP SENSOR TO THE THROTTLE MOTOR AND COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM. I AM AFRAID THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN ACCIDENTS WITH SEVERE INJURIES AND DAMAGE. I FEEL THAT KIA SHOULD RECALL THESE CARS AND FIND A PROPER FIX.",
