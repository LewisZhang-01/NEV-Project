While driving one morning I experienced loss in power and an flashing check engine light and glow plug light on the dash. The car went into \u201climp\u201d mode and I could not accelerate past 40 MPG on a busy road.  I pulled over slowly and let the car sit. After turning the car on off and back on, the CEL went away . I attempted to pull out into traffic and with my foot to the floor, the car has no acceleration leaving me going extremely slow into traffic. The cars acceleration has been terrible and really not safe to drive. I have several CEL codes including P0402.   After having the car inspected we found that the intake filter had  Completely deteriorated at the bottom. Almost as if water had been sitting in the bottom of the air filter box. After removing the old filter and replacing it with a new one, we also cleaned the mass airflow sensor, unplugged it and plugged it back in. This did help the vehicle drive much better. Unfortunately, this only lasted for a very short time. Within several miles later I\u2019m driving a vehicle acceleration issues persisted again. Some fluid was found to be inside of the oil as well.  The car vehicle Is now scheduled to go back to have a full examination in service. Based on some recent finds it also seems that there have been many others who have experienced the same issue.
