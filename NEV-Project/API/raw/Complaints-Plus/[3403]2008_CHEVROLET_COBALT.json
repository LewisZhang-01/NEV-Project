The slanted hill next to a small ditch-about5 ft approximately off road. This all happened very quickly. There was no crash until after I was hit by airbag.  Severely crashed passenger side windshield shattered/no airbag went off. Police and by standers assuming zi lost control and could see where I was headed. I never mentioned to police how I felt airbag went off. I knew their theory didn't match what I felt happened but after going back to scene my scenario from my memory is the only one I can verify.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.   ABOUT A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS LATER ( I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK) AFTER THEY FIXED THE KEY SLOT MY CAR JUST WENT DEAD AND THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WAS THE WIRING FROM THE KEY SLOT FROM THE IGNITION TO WHEREVER IT LEADS AND THAT THEY HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WHEN I TRIED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER ABOUT IT I NEVER GOT THROUGH TO HIM ON HIS PHONE,  HE NEVER ANSWERED HIS CELL PHONE AND WASN'T AT THE OFFICE AND I JUST GAVE UP ON IT.   SO MY QUESTION IS DID OTHERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS I DID WHERE THEY HAD TO PAY FOR WIRING THAT I THINK WAS PART OF THE SAME THING THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY HAD RECALLED TO FIX.  IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT; THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE IGNITION KEYS, THAT COULD ACCIDENTALLY JUST TURN YOUR CAR OFF AND YOU WOULD HAVE  TROUBLE STEERING THE CAR'S STEERING WHEEL AS THE CAR WAS OFF.

MONTHS DOWN THE LINE THE POWER STEERING ISSUE CAME BACK BUT ONLY WORSE. IT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS DRIVING. A DINGING NOISE WENT OFF, \"POWER STEERING\" FLASHED ACROSS THE DASHBOARD, AND ALL THE GAUGES WENT WIGGLING. IT STARTLED ME. AGAIN, I PULLED OVER AND CUT THE ENGINE FOR A SPELL AND WAITED.

MY CAR ALSO HAS THE SAME ISSUE ABOUT THE SPEAKERS THEY GO IN AND OUT AND WORK WHEN THEY WANT TO.

THE FOLLOWING DAY, I INQUIRED OF CHEVROLET AS TO WHETHER THIS PROBLEM WAS INVOLVED IN ANY ONGOING RECALL AND WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS NOT.  IN NOVEMBER, I WAS NOTIFIED BY MAIL THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS NOW INCLUDED IN A SAFETY RECALL (12190) [NHTSA# 12V459]  FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED IN MY CORRESPONDENCE, I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO A CHEVROLET DEALER (POWER CHEVROLET / MESA, AZ) AT WHICH TIME THE MODULE WAS INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND APPROVED.

WHEN I CONTACTED CHEVY AS TO WHY I DID NOT RECEIVE FULL REIMBURSEMENT, I WAS TOLD THAT MY INDEPENDENT REPAIR FACILITY HAD \"OVER CHARGED\" ME FOR THE FUEL PUMP MODULE AND, HAD I TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER INITIALLY, IT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE TO NOT REPLACE THE FUEL FILTER!!

THE KEY DID NOT TURN TO TURN THE CAR OFF NOR COULD I REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.  I DROVE MY CAR TO GM DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE IGNITION CYLINDER NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE THE CAR IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND I HAD NO OTHER PROBLEM.  I HAVE OWNED TWO OTHER CARS, ONE FOR 10 YRS AND ONE FOR 11 YRS NEVER AT ANY TIME DID I HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH GETTING THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION OR PROBLEMS TURNING MY CAR OFF.  I BELIEVE THAT THE IGNITION CYLINDER WAS DEFECTIVE  AND SO I SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR A DEFECTIVE PART TO BE REPLACED. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER MY COMPLAINT.  *TR",

I DROVE STRAIGHT TO HIS SHOP WHERE HE PLUGGED IN HIS DIAGNOSTIC CHECK COMPUTER. HE TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE TRANSMISSION MODULE AND IS A WELL KNOW PROBLEM WITH THE CHEVY COBALT. I HAVE SINCE GOOGLED IT AND FOUND MANY COBALT OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.   I SPOKE TO CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE MY CAR HAS 125,000 MILES IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOT COVERED. I DON'T CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THAT AS THE POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD.

EITHER THE CALIPER IS CAUSING THE PAD TO CONSTANTLY RUB THE ROTOR OR SOME OTHER ISSUE IS PRESENT. I FIRST NOTICED THAT THE ROTORS WERE SCORED AT ABOUT 3,000 MILES, WAS TOLD IT WAS NORMAL. AT 20,000 MILES THE REAR PADS WERE DOWN TO THE METAL ON THE INSIDE PAD. ALSO, ITS NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR PADS, EVERY ROTOR ON THE CAR IS SCORED BEYOND NORMAL WEAR. THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE 2008+ SS COBALTS, NOT WITH THE WAY THEY ARE BEING DRIVEN. GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER, THEY TOO SAID THAT IT WAS UNEVEN WEAR THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. BUT, INSTEAD OF LOOKING INTO THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, THEY SIMPLY REPLACED THE REAR PADS. THIS WAS A TEMPORARY \"PATCH\" NOT A FIX. IN 5,000 MILES, THEY'LL START TO WEAR AGAIN UNEVENLY. I THINK GENERAL MOTORS NEEDS TO EVALUATE THE ROTORS AND PADS ON THESE CARS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, IS THERE AN EXCUSE FOR THE BRAKES AND ROTORS TO BE WORN OUT ON THESE CARS AT 20,000 MILES UNDER DAILY DRIVING CONDITIONS. IF THE PROBLEM ONLY EFFECTED A COUPLE OF CARS, IT COULD BE BLAMED ON THE DRIVING PATTERNS OF THE OPERATOR.

I HAD MADE AT LEAST TWO INQUIRIES TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A TSB (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN) BEING RELEASED ON THE PROBLEM. AT THE TIME THERE HAD NOT BEEN, BUT I HAD NEITHER EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM UP UNTIL THEN.  2. THE FAILURE OCCURS WITH THE PARKING BRAKE MECHANISM. THE PARKING BRAKE FUNCTIONS BY ENGAGING THE INSIDE BRAKE PAD ON THE REAR BRAKES. THERE IS A RETURN SPRING THAT IS SUPPOSE TO DISENGAGE THE BRAKE PAD WHEN THE PARKING BRAKE IS RELEASED. THIS SPRING IS FAILING TO DISENGAGE THE INSIDE PAD CAUSING THE PAD TO WEAR ABNORMALLY. THE RESULT IS THAT THE INSIDE PAD WILL WEAR THIN VERY QUICKLY AND EVENTUALLY BEGIN TO DAMAGE THE BRAKE ROTOR.   3. I HAVE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE AND I WAS DEFERRED TO GM CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THERE TO BE A DEFECT AND WILL NOT PERFORM THE REPLACEMENT WORK UNDER THEIR WARRANTY. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, I WILL BE REPLACING ALL OF THE REAR BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS AND INSTALLING A HIGHER TENSION SPRING ON THE PARKING BRAKE RETURN. *TR",

UPON ARRIVAL, I NOTICED THAT I HAD LOST ABOUT 50% OF MY BRAKING POWER AND THAT THE GRINDING NOISE WAS MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT, 30 MILES EARLIER.  OF COURSE, I REPLACED THE BRAKE PADS, KNOWING THAT THE NOISE THEY WERE MAKING WAS CAUSED BY THE PADS WEARING OUT AND THE METAL GRINDING AGAINST THE ROTOR.  TO MY SURPRISE, ONLY THE INSIDE BRAKE PADS WERE WORN TO THE METAL, AND THE OUTER BRAKE PADS HAD JUST OVER 1/4 OF AN INCH OF PAD LEFT.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY LOCAL GM DEALER AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE IS A TSB (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN) POSTED IN THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT SAYS THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE DRIVER AND THAT GM DEALERS ARE NOT TO COVER THE REAR BRAKE PROBLEM. I KNOW THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL OCCUR IN ANOTHER 20,000 MILES BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CALIPERS OR ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM. THE INSIDE PADS SHOULD NOT WEAR OUT FASTER THAN THE FRONT. THEY SHOULD ALSO WEAR EVENLY. ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THE LOSS OF BRAKING POWER IN ONLY 30 MILES FROM THE EARLIEST SIGN OF A BRAKE PROBLEM.  I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE REAR BRAKES, SPECIFICALLY THE INSIDE BRAKE PADS, ARE DOING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE BRAKING.
