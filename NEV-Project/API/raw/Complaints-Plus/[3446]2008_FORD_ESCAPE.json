Several more miles passed and I arrived at my destination, but as I was backing up to park, the wrench indicator came back on and I had complete loss of steering. Later that afternoon, I started my car again and the wrench indicator was still on and I had still had complete loss of steering. I had to have my car towed to my mechanic. After diagnostics, they confirmed there was an issue with the steering torque sensor, but that they would have to refer me to a Ford Dealership for further diagnostics. My car was then towed to the Ford Dealership. I was told the torque sensor was faulty and I had two options. I could replace the steering torque sensor or replace the entire steering column. But as steering columns are on back order with no ETA of when they will be back in stock, the sensor was my only option to have an operable vehicle. The dealership replaced the sensor and recalibrated the system on Feb 15, 2022. I picked up my car on Feb 18, 2022 and drove it home with no issues. A couple hours later I drove to a FedEx and the wrench indicator started coming on and off, accompanied by my wheel jerking slightly, and loss of steering.

Without me being aware of that I went to turn and my car would not turn, I almost wrecked (because I could not turn the wheel) into the person at the stop light while my kids were in the car. Thankfully I hit my breaks and did not but it was a very scary moment for myself and my kids. I had my car towed to my mechanic who then told me the torque sensor went out. He looked online and it said there was a recall on the exact problem I am having for the exact model I have. I called Ford and one person told me that the software was cleared. I talked to another guy from a different ford who then told me that my car doesn\u2019t and has never had a recall done and it doesn\u2019t qualify. So I am frustrated trying to get this recall done that I\u2019m getting misinformation on from multiple different people at ford. I can not drive my car because the steering is a safety hazard one and two I am not strong enough to turn the wheel if I wanted to. I need to get my children to and from school and myself to and from work and can\u2019t because of this problem. I don\u2019t understand how one person can tell me I had a recall done and the other tell me I did not and can\u2019t. I\u2019m having a hard time believing that I don\u2019t have a recall on this problem when I have the exact problem and my car is a 2008 escape and the recall they have is for a ford escape models 2008-2011 for the torque sensor and software. I am a single mother who doesn\u2019t have the extra money to have this problem fixed especially when there is a recall on my exact problem but no one at ford is being kind enough to help and they are all giving me different information. At this point I don\u2019t know what to do because they are leaving me confused and with no options. I just want this safety hazard fixed as soon as possible.",

And when that started happening, the A/C stopped working and I heard a loud pitched whine coming from the vehicle.  On the days there is no brake warning lights, the brakes still are not great and sometimes will start to stop the vehicle, then there is a kind of hiccup that happens where the pedal just goes to the floor WHILE you are stopping, and not just as you begin braking. There are SO many complaints on the web about people experiencing the EXACT same problems, I don't see why this has not been deemed a Recall yet.  VERY DANGEROUS!!!!",

Upon having the warning light scanned, it appears that the HCU (hydraulic control unit) needs replaced for a tune of $5000 plus.  Upon more research there are many complaints on-line about this problem, unfortunately those of us that drive 13 year old cars typically cant afford such a repair bill for an obviously bad design flaw and must continue driving these dangerous vehicles because we have no choice.

WE DID AND WERE TOLD IT NEEDED A STEERING COLUMN. THE SERVICE REP TOLD US THIS WAS COMMON IN THE ESCAPES AND TO KEEP OUR RECEIPT  BECAUSE FORD MAY HAVE A RECALL. I AM THE SECOND OWNER OF THIS CAR AND RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT THIS ESCAPE WAS RECALLED AND SERVICED IN JUNE OF 2014. THE FORD MOTOR CO TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE DONE SINCE IT WAS SERVICED FOR  THIS ISSUE. I TOLD THE REP THAT I WANTED FORD TO KNOW THAT THE RECALL HAVING BEEN DONE LESS THAN 3 YEARS PRIOR TO MY REPAIR DID NOT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM AND COST ME $1400. THEN THE REP TOLD ME SHE WOULD REPORT MY NEGATIVE COMMENT AND 'IS THERE ANYTHING FORD CAN HELP YOU WITH TODAY?'",

I COULD OBVIOUSLY SEE HER STRUGGLING. I TRIED TO TURN IT AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO TURN. WE HAD TO GET A TOW TRUCK TO PICK IT UP AND BRING IT TO MY HOUSE. I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY, EXPLAINING TO THEM THE PROBLEM. THE LADY TOLD ME THAT EVEN THOUGH MY VEHICLE WAS EXHIBITING THE SAME PROBLEMS UNDER THE RECALL FOR 2008-2011 FORD ESCAPE, THAT MY VIN NUMBER DIDN'T HAVE ANY RECALLS UNDER IT. I ASKED HER TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE OVER HER AND SHE REFUSED SO I THEN HUNG UP ON HER. I CALLED BACK AND SPOKE TO ANOTHER PERSON, THIS PERSON THEN AFTER KEEPING ME ON HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, TOLD ME THAT MY VEHICLE HAD THIS PROBLEM FIXED ALREADY!!! I TOLD HER THAT'S NOT TRUE AND THEN HUNG UP ON HER. I DECIDED TO CALL BACK JUST TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING TO LIE TO ME. THIS THIRD PERSON THAT I SPOKE TO SAID PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING AS THE FIRST PERSON I SPOKE TO. WHY DID THIS LADY, LIE? ALL I KNOW IS MY VEHICLE IS A 2008 FORD ESCAPE AND THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT OTHER FORD ESCAPE OWNERS VEHICLES ARE EXHIBITING, MINE IS AS WELL. WHY ITS NOT UNDER THE RECALL LIST, I DON'T KNOW. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR WRECK OR WORSE. I SHOULD HAVE TO GET INJURED OR KILLED FOR FORD TO REALIZE THAT THE FAULT IS ON THEM TO FIX WHAT THEY SO CALLED TAKE PRIDE IN (THEIR VEHICLES)",

THE LOCAL FIRESTONE SERVICE SHOP FOUND CODE 2278 WHICH WAS FOR STEERING TORQUE SENSOR AND TOLD HER THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVE-ABLE FOR SAFETY REASONS.  IT WAS TOWED TO WINNER FORD IN CHERRY HILL, NJ.    I WAS ALERTED TO THE RECALL AND RESEARCHED IT, DISCOVERING RECALL # 14S05, ISSUED IN 2014, WHICH APPEARED TO AFFECT OUR VEHICLE.    DEALER AND FORD SAY THEY WILL NOT HONOR THIS RECALL BECAUSE THE CAR WAS BROUGHT IN WHEN NOTICE FIRST RECEIVED IN 2014 AND RE-PROGRAMMING WAS DONE TO FIX PROBLEM.  FORD'S RESPONSE WAS THAT ONCE THE RECALL WORK HAS BEEN DONE, THEY ARE NO LONGER OBLIGATED.  FORD REP ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE AGE/MILEAGE OF THE CAR DID NOT WARRANT FURTHER ACTION.    MY POSITION IS THAT THEY PUT A BAND-AID ON A PROBLEM AND NOW THE REAL PROBLEM IS SURFACING - THE TORQUE SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE RECALL NOTICE WHEN CODE 2278 IS FOUND. AGE OF CAR DOES NOT MATTER - IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE FORD CREATED.

ALSO, WHEN MY VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF, WITH THE KEY TAKEN OUT, THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE MODULE OR CENSOR IS EMITTING A HIGH-PITCHED HUM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHEN NOTHING IS TURNED ON.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE FURTHER AS IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH SIMILAR YEAR MODEL HYBRIDS.",

I WAS GETTING READY TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC. PUT FOOT ON ACCELERATOR WENT TO ABOUT 16MPH AND REFUSED TO HO FASTER. RPMS REVVED UP TO 4000+ THE YELLOW WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON. ONCE GOT TO 20MPH HARD SHIFT INTO GEAR .AND DID THIS AGAIN AT 40MPH EXCEPT WONT SHIFT INTO HIGHER GEAR.  WAS TOLD IT IS IN LIMP MODE. SO I DID INTERNET RESEARCH ON THIS. SAID OVER 368 COMPLAINTS JUST ON THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM, SPECIFICALLY ON THE 2008 FORD ESCAPE.  I TRIED RESETTING THE PCM. DID NOT FIX PROBLEM. REPLACED THE THROTTLE CONTROL SENSOR. DID NOT FIX PROBLEM. NOW THAT LEAVES THE 2ND & 4TH GEAR BAND ASSEMBLY. I CALLED AND GOT 3 ESTIMATES, THEY RANGED FROM$1900-$3000. PART COST $89 AND A NEW TRANSMISSION COST $1700. REPLACING THIS PART CAN BE DONE WITHOUT HAVING TO REMOVE TRANSMISSION AND SAID TO ABOUT 2HOURS. MY COMPLAINT IN IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WHY AREN'T YOU REPLACING PART OR FIXING THIS? THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND STILL NOTHING! THIS IS THE FIRST FORD I PURCHASED AND WILL BE THE LAST! WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I LOVE MY TRUCK. JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX IT. SO I WILL PARK IT AND PRAY FORD OWNS UP TO THEIR FAULTY PARTS AND ASSEMBLY AND FIXES THIS. AND I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE I KNOW AND EVERYONE I MEET KNOWS ABOUT HOW FORD KNOWINGLY PUT IN DEFECTIVE PARTS ON MANY VEHICLE SO THEY COULD MAKE MONEY FIXING THEM. THINK ABOUT IT.

WHEN THIS HAPPENED I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 15MPH IN TOWN. I PARKED IT RIGHT AWAY. THE NEXT DAY I WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE WHEEL AT ALL. THE VEHICLE STARTS BUT IS COMPLETELY UNABLE TO BE DRIVEN. AFTER RESEARCHING MORE ON THIS ISSUE, I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2008 FORD ESCAPES FOR THIS SAME ISSUE. WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED, THEY HAD ME GIVE THEM MY VIN NUMBER. THEY THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR RECALL REPAIRS AND THE RECALL ONLY APPLIES TO VEHICLES WITH A SPECIFIC VIN NUMBER. I WANTED TO REACH OUT AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO TO GET THIS RESOLVED CONSIDERING THIS IS A MECHANICAL ISSUE OUT OF MY CONTROL AND MAY BE A MANUFACTURING ERROR.

FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE STATES THAT THE RECALL IS OVER 12 MONTHS OLD AND THE SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED AND THEY NO LONGER CONSIDER IT AN ISSUE. MEANWHILE, I'M CURRENTLY STRANDED AND WILL BE OUT OF ALMOST $600 OR MORE THAT I DON'T HAVE!

I HAVE BEEN POURING OVER FORD FORUMS AND SEE MANY, MANY FORD ESCAPES ARE DOING EXACT SAME THING, LOSING POWER STEERING WHILE DRIVING AND FORD IS REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE PROBLEM.  HOW MAY I GET A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT STARTED FOR THIS ISSUE VS FORD?  *TR",

INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE TORQUE SENSOR, FORD SERVICE DECIDED TO JUST REPROGRAM IT BECAUSE IT HAD NOT FAILED OR PRODUCED A SERVICE CODE. JUST RECENTLY THE TORQUE SENSOR FAILED AND MY STEERING LOST POWER WHILE DRIVING THROUGH A PARKING LOT. I DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TURN THE WHEEL AND HAD TO JUST STOP AND LEAVE THE CAR IN THE LOT UNTIL SOMEONE COULD COME HELP ME. I BROUGHT MY CAR BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT PERFORMED THE ORIGINAL RECALL REPAIR AND AM BEING TOLD THAT THE RECALL HAS BEEN PERFORMED AND NOW I MUST PAY THEM TO REPLACE THE TORQUE SENSOR. AFTER SPENDING TIME RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ONLINE I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM. IT IS APPARENT THAT FORD IS ONLY REPLACING THE SENSORS IF THEY HAVE ALREADY FAILED WHEN YOU BRING YOUR CAR IN FOR THE RECALL. IF IT HAS NOT FAILED THEN FORD ONLY DOES A REPROGRAMMING THAT DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM FAILING BUT ALLOWS FORD TO CLOSE OUT THE RECALL ON YOUR VEHICLE AND SAVE MONEY ON A REPLACEMENT PART. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS LEGAL FOR THEM TO DO. I TALKED TO SEVERAL OF FORD'S SERVICE MANAGERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY ALL GIVE THE STANDARD REHEARSED ANSWER.  *TR",

FEBRUARY 2016 - NO ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON BUT WHEN I TURN THE KEY OVER FOR THE LAST 6WKS SOMETIMES MY ESCAPE STARTS UP SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT WITH A NOTICE \"POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT\" - AS WEEKS WENT BY, THE STEERING WHEEL IS SHAKING MORE RANDOMLY WHILE DRIVING AND STOPPING.    THE ONLY WAY TO START MY FORD ESCAPE IS BY REMOTE START TO BYPASS THE STARTER.    RECENTLY,I TOOK MY CAR INTO MY LOCAL MECHANIC, AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THE TORQUE SENSOR IS CRACKED. I WAS TOLD BY FORD EMPLOYEES, 2 OTHER LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIPS & THE MECHANIC TO TAKE THE ESCAPE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO OPENED UP THE ORIGINAL RECALL BACK IN AUGUST 2014.    THAT ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP DID MAKE A CLAIM, FORD WARRANTY DENIED THE CLAIM- THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T \"CHOOSE\" TO TELL FORD WARRANTY THEY NEVER LOOKED AT THE RECALL PARTS IN AUGUST 2014 THEY JUST DID THE UPGRADE, THEIR LIABILITY \"THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER TOLD THEM TO DO, NO WARNING LIGHT NO REPLACEMENT PARTS\".    I PAID $70+ FOR WHAT THE MECHANIC JUST DID FOR FREE. THAT DEALERSHIP DID NOT CHECK FOR ANY PARTS THAT NEEDED REPLACED BACK ON 2014.     NOT ONLY DID THE DEALERSHIP CHARGE ME $70, I TOOK THE ESCAPE BACK TO THE LOCAL MECHANIC AND PAID $500 FOR A NEW TORQUE SENSOR; SAME EXACT PART FALLING UNDER THE RECALL \"POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT\".     DENIED CLAIM ON 2/19/2016, REASON- IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE MY RECALL UPDATE WAS DONE THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED THE PART BACK IN 2014. I DRIVE 2 CARS, SERIOUSLY?",

IDENTIFYING A RECALL PROCEDURE BY ONLY CHECKING IF THE CODES WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF RECALL IS NOT A GUARANTEED WAY TO REPLACE ALL FAULTY SENSORS.

HE ALSO SAID BECAUSE THEY CLOSED THE RECALL THAT I WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE MODULE REPLACED BECAUSE IF THEY DID IT THEY WOULDNT BE REIMBURSED FOR THE REPAIR. THEY ALSO SAID WELL SINCE THEY DID THE REPROGRAM I PUT OVER 200 MILES ON THE TRUCK SO THE POWER STEERING TORQUE COULD HAVE GONE OUT BECAUSE OF THAT.",

I CALLED A MECHANIC AND THEY SAID THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS THE STARTER. I DID NOT THINK SO, BUT TOOK IT TO MECHANIC AND THEY DID THE WORK AND REPLACED THE STARTER COSTING ME MONEY THAT I DO NOT HAVE AS I AM ON A FIXED INCOME. GOT THE CAR BACK LAST WEEK AND YESTERDAY WAS SITTING IN A CAR DEALER LOT AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS TIME IT WOULD NOT START AND HAD TO CALL FOR A RIDE AFTER SITTING IN THE HOT 90 PLUS DEGREE HEAT. MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP AGAIN TODAY AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHY IT WILL NOT START. TO ME AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING FAULTY IN THE STEERING COLUMN. EITHER WAY, I AM TERRIFIED THAT IT WILL START A FIRE, OR WORSE LEAVE ME STRANDED WHERE NO ONE CAN COME AND GET ME. I AM AN ELDERLY WOMAN AND CAN NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES WITH MY CAR. IF THIS COULD BE LOOKED INTO AND TAKEN CARE OF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE THE INVOICES FROM THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE CAR.

ABOUT MAY 30, 2015, I EXPERIENCED A POWER STEERING FAILURE AS I WAS ABOUT TO TURN LEFT, FROM A STOP AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT.  I ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN THE OUTER TURN LANE AND WAS ALMOST HIT BY THE CAR BEHIND ME. I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE. SHE GAVE ME A CASE # CAS7268220T6F2P6 TO GIVE TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPT AS A MATTER OF PRIORITY. AFTER A FEW DAYS, THEY SAID ON INSPECTION IT ONLY NEEDED TO BE REPROGRAMMED TO FIX THE ISSUE.  ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER, THE POWER STEERING FAILURE HAPPENED AGAIN.  I TOOK IT TO THE SAME FORD DEALER ON 06/22/2015 AND ON 06/25/2015 WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT FORD DID NOT APPROVE THEM TO ADDRESS MY POWER STEERING FAILURE BECAUSE MY CAR HAD EXCEEDED 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES FROM THE FIRST DATE ADDRESSED.  I CALLED FORD TO DISPUTE THEIR DECISION, STATING THAT I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF THE RECALL WAS TO FIX AN OVERWHELMING FAILURE OF A PART OR SYSTEM. I SAID THAT WHAT IF THE REPROGRAMMING DID NOT WORK, WERE THEY NOT OBLIGATED TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART IF NECESSARY.  WILL FORD NOW HIDE BEHIND A 12 MONTH/12,000 MILE RULE.  THE FORD REP SAID HER HANDS WERE TIED BY COMPANY POLICY. I AM PASSING THIS ON TO THE NHTSA FOR FAIR RESOLUTION. THIS 2008 FORD ESCAPE HAD ANOTHER RECALL # 14S19 RELATING TO ELECTRONIC COOLING PUMP FAILURE. FORD SENT NOTICES OUT IN MAY 2015. MY COOLING PUMP FAILURE OCCURRED IN MAY 2013. I SPENT $747.31 TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID, WITH THE PART REPLACED, I ONLY NEEDED REPROGRAMMING.  FORD AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE $747.31.

FORTUNATELY, IT'S A CAR MY SON DRIVES WHEN HE IS HOME FOR COLLEGE BREAK SO WE WEREN'T USING IT THAT OFTEN AND I HELD OFF TAKING IT BACK TO FORD DEALER.  I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE ESCAPE BACK TO THE DEALER THIS MONTH TO REPORT THE STEERING PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THE ESCAPE NOW NEEDS TO REPLACE THE TORQUE SENSOR FOR THE POWER STEERING. (IN OCTOBER, THE DEALER REPROGRAMMED THE PSM AND MADE NO OTHER REPAIRS TO STEERING PARTS.) ALL OF THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT THE RECALL THAT I HAVE READ THIS SPRING MENTION THAT THE TORQUE SENSOR WAS ONE OF THREE THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE RECALL. THE TORQUE SENSOR IN MY ESCAPE WAS NOT CHANGED, AND NOW THE FORD DEALER IS QUOTING A PRICE OF $500 TO $600 TO DO THE REPAIR.

WHAT THE REPROGRAMMING OF THE POWER STEERING CONTROL MODULE ACTUALLY DID WAS TO PROGRAM THE STEERING COLUMN SENSOR TO ILLUMINATE THE WRENCH ICON ON THE DASHBOARD TO LET THE DRIVER KNOW THAT THE POWER STEERING ASSIST WAS ABOUT TO BE DISABLED ON THE VEHICLE.

ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND 123,000 MILES THE VEHICLE WAS RECALLED FOR POWER STEERING ASSIST FAIL, WHICH I KNEW WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR FROM THE BEGINNING.  AT THAT TIME, THEY SAID AGAIN, THEY PERFORMED THE RECALL AND NOTHING NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  NOW AT 128,000 MILES THE POWER ASSIST FAIL LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON AND I ONLY HAVE MANUAL STEERING.  I TOOK IT TO THE GARAGE FOR WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE COVERED REPAIRS AND THEY STATED THAT FORD WILL NOT COVER THE STEERING COLUMN REPLACE, WHICH IS NEEDED, BECAUSE THE RECALL SENSOR WAS REPLACED THE LAST TIME I WAS IN.  TO ME THAT IS NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM AT ALL, IT IS SIMPLY NOW ABLE TO TELL ME THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, WHICH I KNEW ABOUT OVER 28,000 MILES AGO.  THE GARAGE SAYS IT IS TOTALLY UP TO FORD TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL PAY FOR THE RECALL AND THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS NOT HOW A RECALL SHOULD BE REPAIRED.  THEY ARE NOT COVERING WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, JUST THE SENSOR THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG.

A FORD REBUILD TRANSMISSION WOULD COST ME OVER $4200,A JUNK YARD TRANSMISSION $3800,CALLED AAMCO THEY SAID $2200 I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE IN 2011 WITH A LITTLE OVER 34,000 MILES,IT CURRENTLY HAS 58,300 MILES ON IT,NOW IN 3 YRS I HAVE DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE  LESS THEN 25,000 MILES.MEANING AROUND 8,000 MILES IF THAT A YEAR.SO WHY IN THE WORLD DO I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSIONS? I LEARNED THERE WAS A SERIOUS AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE FORD ESCAPES 2005-2013 MODELS ALL WITH THIS SAME ISSUE, INSTEAD OF FORD DOING A RECALL AND FIXING THE PROBLEM,THEY SETTLE ON A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM,BUT INSTEAD OF THEM INCLUDING ALL THE VEHICLES WITH THIS ISSUE,THEY ONLY DO IT FOR THE 2009-2013 MODELS. I TALKED TO SOMEONE FROM THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY SAID MY CAR WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM CAUSE ITS A 08 ,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ON THE YEAR ITS THE SAME ISSUE AS ALL THE OTHER ESCAPES .NOW IS THAT FAIR IF THERE'S OTHER YEAR MODELS OUT THERE NOW EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE.THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES AND FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IN FIXING THE PROBLEM.NOW I HAVE A VEHICLE THAT I CANT DRIVE AND HAVE TO WAIT TO GET UP THE MONEY TO FIX. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A FORD VEHICLE AGAIN IF THIS IS HOW THEY TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS.   *JS",

DOME LIGHT ASSEMBLY - SWITCH BURNT:  IN EARLY 2014 THE MANUAL SLIDE SWITCH ON THE DOME LIGHT SHORTED OUT AND MELTED ? BURNING THE INSIDE OF THE ASSEMBLY.  THUS, THE SWITCH WOULD NO LONGER OPERATE PROPERLY.  IT WAS DISCONNECTED BY THE OWNER.  A FORD REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLY WAS PURCHASED IN SEPTEMBER, 2014, WHICH REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE ASSEMBLY.  THE ASSEMBLY HAD AN ENGINEERING CHANGE WHICH ELIMINATED THE MANUAL SLIDE SWITCH.  OWNER HAS PICTURES AND HAS RETAINED THE DEFECTIVE ASSEMBLY.    NOTE:  THE MELTING OF THE SLIDE SWITCH AND BURNING OF THE PLASTIC HOUSING COULD HAVE IGNITED THE HEADLINER.  VERY DANGEROUS.      2.  AIR BAG FUSE:  WHEN REPLACING THE DOME LIGHT ASSEMBLY, IT WAS NOTICED THAT A FUSE HAD BLOW DUE TO THE SWITCH MELTING.  THE FUSE PANEL WAS ACCESSED AND IT WAS VERIFIED THAT FUSE #25 (DEMAND LAMPS) WAS OPEN.  A SPARE FUSE, PER THE OWNER?S MANUAL, WAS MOVED FROM POSITION #32 (SPARE) TO POSITION #25.  THE NEW DOME LIGHT NOW WORKED PROPERLY.  HOWEVER, THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE SRS (SAFETY RESTRAINT SYSTEM) LIGHT WAS ON WHICH INDICATED A POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH THE SRS.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE DEALER ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014.  IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT FUSE POSITION #32 IS REALLY NOT A SPARE AS INDICATED IN THE OWNER?S MANUAL ? IT IS INSTEAD THE FUSE THAT CONTROLS THE RESTRAINTS CONTROL MODULE CIRCUIT WHICH WHEN IT WAS REMOVED CAUSED THE SRS LIGHT TO APPEAR.  (OF COURSE THE DEALER CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE!)  SUBJECT VEHICLE OWNER?S MANUAL CAN BE FOUND ONLINE.)    NOTE: THE OWNER?S MANUAL MUST BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE APPROPRIATE FUSE LOCATIONS.  IF SOMEONE HAD TO USE THE SPARE FUSE INCORRECTLY MARKED, WHILE DRIVING REMOTELY, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT, THE AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY!  VERY DANGEROUS.  *TR",

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND WHILE WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE IT HAPPEN WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, THIS DEFECTIVE PART HAS OR WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOMEONE SERIOUS INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE.  NHTSA NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS AND FORD NEEDS TO ADMIT THEIR ERROR AND DEFECT.  *TR",

NEAR THE END OF MY TRIP THE CRACKED RING APPEARS TO HAVE SHAKEN FREE, SLIPPING ON THE ROTATING DRIVESHAFT SURFACE. THIS MAY HAVE MADE THE SENSOR THINK THE WHEEL WAS NOT TURNING AND APPLIED THE ABS TO THAT WHEEL EACH TIME THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED. THE DANGER THEN BECAME INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCE ON DRY GROUND AND UNKNOWN PERFORMANCE ON SLIPPERY SURFACES. IN CHECKING AROUND, THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND THE OTHER RING WILL CRACK EVENTUALLY DUE TO SIMILAR RUSTING.

I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME TO FEED THE DOGS, AND MY HUSBAND WAS OUT OF TOWN, SO RATHER THAN CALL A TOW TRUCK I RESTARTED THE CAR AND KEPT GOING IN THE RIGHT-HAND LANE FOR ANOTHER 3 OR 4 MILES UNTIL THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN.  IT TOOK ANOTHER 2 HOURS (WITH AN 15-20 ADDITIONAL STALLING EPISODES) UNTIL BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME TO ANNAPOLIS. THROUGH THE INTERNET (AND MY HUSBAND CRAWLING UNDER THE CAR) WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS A WELL-DOCUMENTED FAULTY OEM HYBRID DRIVE TRAIN MECS COOLANT WATER PUMP.  SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE THAT IS EVERY BIT AS SERIOUS AS THE GM IGNITION SWITCH PROBLEM, AND A FATAL ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE, AND UNCONSCIONABLE THAT NHTSA HAS NOT FORCED FORD TO DO SO.  *TR",

IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS WHEN DRIVING SINCE YOU MAY BE TRYING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP BUT ARE UNABLE TO DUE TO THE GAS PEDAL STICKING.

ON 1/16/2014 (THURSDAY) THAT MORNING BEFORE I WENT TO WORK, THE STEERING WHEEL WAS STIFF.  SO I HAD TO CUT THE CAR OFF AND CUT IT BACK ON AND IT LOOSENED UP.  I KNEW AT THAT POINT THAT IS WASN'T THE SWAY BAR LINKS.  SO THAT FRIDAY (1/17/2014) I TOOK IT IN TO A CAR SHOP CLOSE TO MY HOUSE (WASN'T A FORD DEALERSHIP) AND I WAS TOLD THAT MY ELECTRONIC STEERING COLUMN WAS BAD AND THAT THE SENSOR WAS DYING.  I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING UNTIL I LOOKED ONLINE AND SAW THAT I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND IN CANADA WHO HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  TO BE EXACT THE SAME PROBLEM!!  FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS ISSUE.  I'M SURE FORD HAS TONS OF PEOPLE THAT REVIEW ALL ONLINE COMMENTS, SO THEY HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  THIS IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE JUST TODAY(1/21/2014) MY FIANCE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND SHE CAME TO A RED LIGHT.  WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO, THE STEERING WHEEL GOT STIFF AND MADE IT HARD TO TURN.  THE SENSOR WENT OUT AND IT WAS MANUAL TURNING.  SHE GOT TO WORK AND WHEN HER SHIFT WAS OVER, SHE STARTED THE CAR AND THE STEERING WAS LOOSE AGAIN.   WE CAN NOT DRIVE LIKE THIS AND KNOW ONE ELSE WITH AN FORD ESCAPE SHOULD HAVE TO DRIVE LIKE THIS EITHER.  I ALSO FOUND OUT THROUGH VARIOUS WEBSITES THAT 2008 WAS THE FIRST YEAR THEY WENT TO THIS ELECTRONIC STEERING COLUMN.  THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE THE PROPER TESTING ON THIS VEHICLE, I ONLY HAVE 63000 MILES ON THIS CAR AND THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE SO SOON!

DOES MY SON HAVE TO DIE BEFORE THE AGENCY TAKES ACTION?  PLEASE TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY TO ENSURE THE REASONABLE SAFETY OF FORD ESCAPE DRIVERS.  I WILL BE HAPPY TO DIRECT YOU TO THE OTHER FORUMS OR ASSIST IN ANY MANNER THE AGENCY REQUESTS.  TAKE CARE.  *TR",

CALLED ON FORD DEALER ON 12/16/13 REGARDING INCIDENT OF PEDAL STICKING, AND RECEIVED HEAD WRENCHING RESPONSE.

WE KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW-SHUT DOWN ENGINE AND RESTART; HOWEVER, IF THIS HAPPENS WHILE ON HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC WHILE ATTEMPTING TO EITHER PASS OR GET BACK IN YOU LANE --IT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING TO NOT ONLY US BUT THE OTHERS ON HIGHWAY.  PLEASE, THERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH COMPLAINTS FOR A REMEDY -OR AT LEAST AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY FORD -NOT AS OUR E-MAIL TO FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND A REPLY BY A REPRESENTATIVE, [XXX], WHO STATED THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY FEEL NECESSARY AND AS TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS PROBLEM, BY TELLING US TO TAKE TO FORD DEALERSHIP FOR AN ANALYSIS TEST BY THEIR PROFESSIONAL MECHANICS AND TECHNICIANS.   WE AS DO SO MANY FORD OWNERS KNOW THE PROBLEM-CAUSE-AND WHY MUST WE PAY A LARGE ANALYSIS PROBLEM FOR SAME.   THANK YOU NHTSA-WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME ONE THAT IS CONCERNED.

IN ORDER TO MOVE THE CAR OUT OF THE WAY TO SOMEWHERE SAFE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I HAD TO SHIFT DOWN INTO FIRST GEAR AND ALMOST FLOOR THE GAS IN ORDER TO FIGHT AGAINST THE HEAVILY APPLIED BRAKE SYSTEM. ONCE OUT OF THE WAY, I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD THE CAR REPAIRED AT A LOCAL GARAGE. THE GARAGE FIXED THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING A BROKEN \"TONE RING\" ON THE CAR - A TOOTHED RING AROUND THE AXLE THAT THE ABS SYSTEM USES TO MEASURE WHETHER THE WHEELS ARE SLIPPING. A CRACK IN THE RING HAD WIDENED THE GAP BETWEEN TWO OF THE TEETH, MAKING THE ABS COMPUTER GO HAYWIRE THINKING THAT THE WHEELS WERE SLIPPING. SINCE THEN IN 15000 ADDITIONAL MILES, I'VE HAD ALL THREE OTHER TONE RINGS BRAKE, CAUSING SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO DIFFERENT DEGREES. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MULTIPLE MECHANICS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON ON THE FORD ESCAPE, AND THAT THE TONE RING - DESPITE BEING HIGHLY EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE CAR - IS MADE OUT OF VERY CORRODIBLE MATERIAL AND THEY SEE THEM BREAK ALL THE TIME.

I STOPPED AS SOON AS I COULD GET OFF THE FREEWAY AND CALLED [XXX] BACK. HE SAID TO BRING THE CAR BACK IN THE MORNING AND HE WOULD LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK IN THE MORNING 7:15AM. THE LIGHTS WERE OFF AGAIN. I PICKED THE CAR UP AT 5:15 PM AND [XXX] RE-ITERATED HIS PREVIOUS SUGGESTIONS. I DROVE THE CAR HOME, AND THE LIGHTS CAME BACK ON AS I WAS EXITING THE FREE-WAY. AGAIN, THE BRAKES TOOK MORE PRESSURE TO STOP. I CALLED DON AND ASKED IF THERE WAS A PAYMENT PLAN AVAILABLE. HE SAID NO. I ASKED IF I REPLACE THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE PROBLEMS PERSISTS, WHAT WOULD OUR NEXT STEP BE? HE SAID ESSENTIALLY THAT WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN, BUT THAT TYPICALLY ONE PROBLEM MAY CO-EXIST WITH ANOTHER PROBLEM, SO UNTIL THEY ADDRESS THE FIRST PROBLEM, THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE 2ND PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT AN E-MAIL TO THE FORD COMPANY THIS AFTERNOON. I ASKED IF FORD HAS TAKEN ANY ACTION AGAINST THE NUMEROUS AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS WITH SIMILAR SITUATIONS AS ARE POSTED ON THE INTERNET REGARDING THIS ISSUE.

THIS CONDITION MAY RESULT IN REDUCED POWER AS THE SYSTEM ACTIVATES FAIL SAFE OPERATION.\" FORD KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS CLEARLY HAPPENING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

ON A VEHICLE STEERING SYSTEM, ITS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE (YOU CANNOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL) AND A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.

THE WHEEL WOULD JERK TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND MAKE A \"CLUCKING\" NOISE.  ONCE THE CAR WAS MOVING THE JERKING SEEMED TO STOP.  BUT THEN WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE STARTED THE CAR THERE MIGHT BE NO POWER STEERING OR POWER FORWARD.  THE CAR WOULD HAVE TO BE FORCIBLY STEERED TO THE SIDE AND THE ENGINE TURNED OFF.  STARTING THE ENGINE AGAIN, THE CAR HAD POWER STEERING AND ENGINE POWER.  THIS BEGAN TO HAPPEN  NEARLY EVERY TIME THE CAR WAS STARTED, AND THE JERKING OF THE WHEEL EVERY TIME THE CAR WAS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL OR STOP.  WHILE THE PROBLEM HAS YET TO CAUSE A DANGEROUS SITUATION THE POTENTIAL IS CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR WHILE DRIVING.  HAVING REVIEWED THE WEB SITES FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE 2008 ESCAPE THERE ARE LITERALLY DOZENS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.  ONE SITE LISTS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS EXACTLY LIKE MINE AND IN SOME THERE HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTS AND POTENTIAL INJURY.  FORD IS STONEWALLING EVERYONE ON THIS EVEN WHEN THE MILEAGE IS LESS THAN 50, 000 MILES.  OFTEN THEY SAY THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE PROBLEM AND REFUSE TO OFFER ASSISTANCE IN MEETING CHARGES THAT RANGE UPWARD TO $1700.  GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT I NOW HAVE I CONSIDER THIS TO BE VERY DANGEROUS AND AM HESITANT TO DRIVE THE CAR.  THE LACK OF CONCERN BY FORD SEEMS TO ME TO BE A SERIOUS MATTER AND ONE THAT SHOULD CONCERN NHTSA. *TR",

WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS REPORTED IN EARLY PERIOD, I (THE CUSTOMER) WAS ADVISED TO DISREGARD, BECAUSE THE MECHANIC FORGOT TO RESET AFTER THE OIL SERVICE,      WHEN FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NOTIFIED TODAY (11/7/12), IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SERVICE ISSUE, WHICH I DO NOT AGREE. SINCE THE PROBLEM EXISTED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NEW IN EARLY STAGES AFTER THE PURCHASE, MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WITH BATTERY DOOR WHICH MALFUNCTIONS, AND DOES NOT ALLOW VENTILATION ON & OFF.     THE BATTERY WAS DOWN, ALL CONTROLS DISAPPEARED AND THE CAR WAS LOCKED IN POSITION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO (APPROXIMATE JUNE 2010). THAT TIME A MAJOR SERVICE WAS PERFORMED, WHICH REQUIRED A MONTH LONG PERIOD TO FIX IT. (SAFECAR REFERENCE 365127). UNFORTUNATELY, I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM YOUR OFFICE ON THIS PAST ISSUE AND COMPLAINT.

WE GOT A FLAT ON THE HIGHWAY IN IRVINE CA. WE PULLED OVER AND CHANGED THE TIRE BUT WHEN WE STARTED THE ENGINE IT WOULD NOT START. THE LIGHTS CAME ON BUT WITH A WARNING LIGHT TO \"STOP SAFELY NOW\". I THOUGHT THIS WAS FROM THE TIRE AND PRESSED THE RESET BUTTON BUT THE WARNING WOULD NOT CLEAR. WE JUMPED THE CAR ONCE AND WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, WE JUMPED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN NOTHING, WE TOWED THE VEHICLE TO A MECHANIC AND THE TOW TRUCK TRIED TO JUMP IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME THE LIGHTS WOULD NOT COME ON. WE JUMPED WHILE HOLDING THE BUTTON FOR THE HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY WHICH WE  FOUND OUT ABOUT IN THE MANUAL BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT START. WE PAID THE TOW AND CALLED FOR A RIDE HOME. I MISSED WORK AND MY MOTHER TOOK ME BACK TO LA TO WAIT FOR THE CAR. THE MECHANIC REPLACED THE BATTERY. I WAITED 8 HOURS FOR THE MECHANIC TO SAY THAT THE CAR NEEDED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF A SAFETY MODE AND THAT THIS CAN'T BE DONE MANUALLY IN THE EVENT IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THE NEXT WEEK, AFTER PULLING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY TO GO HOME SUNDAY NIGHT THE RED TRIANGLE LIGHT CAME ON AND WARNED ME TO \"STOP SAFELY NOW\" AND THEN I COULD NOT ACCELERATE PAST 20MPH AND THEN 10MPH AS I SLOWED TO PULL OVER. I KILLED THE ENGINE, WAITED TEN MIN. AND RESTARTED BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AND THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. I WAITED UNTIL MIDNIGHT TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER, GOT A RIDE, AND I AM NOW ON THE BUS UNTIL SOMETHING CAN BE DONE. AFTER RESEARCHING OTHER COMPLAINTS I AM SAD TO FIND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON, IT IS UNRESOLVED, IT IS DANGEROUS FOR A SAFETY MECHANISM TO CAUSE THE DRIVER TO SUDDENLY LOSE POWER, AND IT IS INCONVENIENT TO BE STRANDED AND UNABLE TO TROUBLESHOOT THE CAR IF THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE AND IT IS A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION. *TR",

IT STARTED WITH THE STEERING WHEEL OCCASIONALLY CLUNKING AND SHAKING BOTH WHEN DRIVING AND WHEN THE CAR WAS IDLE (AS LONG AS IT WAS STARTED). AS SOON AS THE WHEEL WAS TURNED TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT THE POWER STEERING WOULD ENGAGE AND IT WOULD BE FINE. THE PROBLEM QUICKLY GOT WORSE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CLUNKING/SHAKING WAS HAPPENING AT ALL TIMES UNTIL THE POWER STEERING JUST FLAT OUT FAILED WHILE DRIVING. LUCKILY I WAS IN A POSITION TO REACT AND MANUALLY STEER WITHOUT INCIDENT BUT I WAS DEFINITELY WORRIED AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.     THE PLACE I BOUGHT IT WON'T HONOR MY WARRANTY AS THIS ISN'T COVERED UNDER THE POWER TRAIN(UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT STILL VERY FRUSTRATING) AND WITH THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING THERE IS NO FIX WITHOUT SWAPPING OUT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN. $1250 PARTS+LABOR+TAX. I CALLED FORD DIRECTLY AND THEY JUST TOSSED ME AROUND SAYING THAT THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT AND SEE IF THEY CAN FIX IT AS MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THEY SAID I COULD EXPECT A CALL BACK IN A FEW DAYS, 1 WEEK TOPS. 3 WEEKS LATER AND NO PHONE CALL. AFTER FINDING THIS WEBSITE I REALIZED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. ALSO, THE PART IS ON BACK ORDER EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS MUCH BIGGER THAN INDICATED ON THIS FORUM. I AM FRUSTRATED IN TRYING TO HOLD FORD ACCOUNTABLE. THE LADY AT FORD EXPLAINED THAT RECALLS ARE JUSTIFIED BY CRASH DATA AND THERE IS NO WAY TO GET ONE STARTED PRIOR.

AFTER DOING TONS OF RESEARCH ON LINE, IF FIND OUT ABOUT A TRANS COOLER DEFECT. I SEE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO 100'S IF NOT 1000'S OF PEOPLE THAT OWNED 2008 ESCAPES. I WAS TOLD FORD DID DO SOME REPAIRS ON THESE CARS THAT WHERE BUILT EARLY 2008, AND THAT A CSP (CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM) WAS SENT OUT MARCH 2010, AND EXPIRED IN AUGUST 2010. MY ESCAPE WAS BUILT IN SEPT. 2007, WHICH SHOULD HAVE COVERED IT. FORD SENT A CSP #09B10 TO OWNERS FOR A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE OF THE KNOW DEFECT TO THE COOLER. SINCE I DIDN'T NOT OWN THE VEHICLE UNTIL NOVEMBER 2010, I HAD NO IDEA OF THE PROBLEM, AND SINCE THE ORIGINAL OWNER NEVER TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIR, I HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE. I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER CARE, AND BOTH THEM, AND THE FORD DEALER ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECT, BUT WOULD NOT COVER IT. SINCE THERE IS NO RECALL, AND THE CSP IS OVER, I HAD TO PAY $644.41 OUT OF MY POCKET. THIS IS RIDICULES I AM PAYING FOR A DEFECT THAT FORD KNOWS ABOUT. THEY BOTH TOLD ME TO HOLD ON TO MY RECEIPT IN CASE THERE IS A RECALL I CAN GET REIMBURSED. I THINK THIS IS THE LAST FORD I WILL OWN.

THE MOST RECENT FAILURE HAS BEEN THE STEERING SHAFT AND A JOINT WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO BE UNABLE TO STEER. IT HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT AND I JUST SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES SO I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. THE CAR WAS CLUNKING AND MY MECHANIC SAID MOST LIKELY IT'S A BALL JOINT OR TIE ROD AND TO GET IT IN SOON, BUT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH UP AS THIS VEHICLE WAS JUST IN DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION COOLER WHICH WAS ALMOST A $1000 REPAIR. THE CAR AGAIN IS UNDRIVEABLE, AND FROM WHAT I RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM IS ANOTHER $1500 TO REPAIR. FORD IS MAKING MONEY HAND OVER FIST WITH THESE VEHICLES AND WILL NOT REPAIR ANYTHING. SECOND MAJOR ISSUE WHERE I WAS TOLD OUT OF WARRANTY NOT OUR PROBLEM!  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET KILLED, IF I WASN'T 1 YEAR FROM PAYING THIS JUNK BOX OFF I WOULD DUMP IT. THE FIRST ISSUE ALMOST CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE PART THAT FAILED DUMPED ALL MY TRANSMISSION FLUID OUT AND I WENT TO MERGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY AND MY VEHICLE ALMOST STOOD STILL AND WOULD NOT MOVE. THIS STEERING PROBLEM WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE AS 95% OF MY 55 MILE COMMUTE IS HIGHWAY AND I AM THANKING GOD IT HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT AND NOT ON THE HIGHWAY. SOMEONE NEEDS TO HELP US NOT ONLY TO GET FORD TO FIX AND PAY FOR THEIR FAULTY PRODUCT BUT TO RECALL THESE ITEMS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED!!!! DON'T BUY A FORD ESCAPE THEY ARE DANGEROUS AND A HUGE MONEY PIT! *TR",

A RED EXCLAMATION POINT WITHIN A TRIANGLE APPEARS ON THE CONTROL PANEL AND A SINCERELY BIZARRE MESSAGE DISPLAYS ITSELF:  \"PLEASE PULL OVER SAFELY\".  THIS IS QUITE THE CHALLENGE WITH 18 WHEELERS BEHIND ME, TO THE SIDE OF ME, AND OTHER CARS ALL AROUND.  WITH QUICK REFLEXES, I AM ABLE TO GET OVER TWO LANES AND SLOWLY (I THINK ONLY THE ELECTRIC ENGINE IS WORKING, NO GAS) DRIVE OFF THE NEXT EXIT.  SITTING IN THE CAR, I AM IN SHOCK.  WHAT JUST HAPPENED?  WILL IT HAPPEN AGAIN?  BECAUSE WE ARE ON OUR WAY HOME FROM OREGON TO THE EAST BAY AREA IN CA, WE ATTEMPT TO GET BACK ON THE FREEWAY AND MAKE OUR WAY SOUTH.  WITHIN 40 MINUTES THE SAME FAILURE HAPPENS AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME THERE ISN'T AN EXIT RAMP.  WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF AN BUSY TWO-LANE SOUTHERN TRAVELING FREEWAY.  ONCE SAFELY TO THE SIDE, THE CAR RESTARTS AND APPEARS TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  NOW I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT, BUT WANT TO GET HOME.  I DECIDE TO GO A LITTLE UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT (A HAZARD) AND STAY IN THE LEFT LANE.  AFTER THE CAR FAILS AND TELLS ME TO \"PULL OVER SAFELY NOW\" FOR THE 5TH TIME, I DECIDE I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.  WE CALL FORD'S ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE NUMBER AND WAIT TWO HOURS (YES! TWO HOURS!) FOR A TOW TRUCK, ONLY TO BE CALLED BACK BY AN AUTOMATED DISPATCH THAT GIVES US THE NAME OF A DIFFERENT TOWING SERVICE THAT ESTIMATES ITS ARRIVAL TIME IN 2 HOURS (THE FIRST COMPANY APPARENTLY HAD TO GO TO A POLICE EMERGENCY TOW, BUT I BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T AGREE ON A DECENT WAGE FOR THE SERVICE).  NOT WANTING TO WAIT 2 MORE HOURS, I ATTEMPT TO DRIVE AGAIN.  WITHIN 10 MINUTES, THE CAR FAILS AND WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GLIDE TO AN OFF RAMP AND INTO A GAS STATION PARKING LOT.  THANK GOODNESS WE DIDN'T GET ANY FURTHER; THE NEXT STRETCH OF FREEWAY HAD NO SHOULDER AT ALL AND THE NEXT PART WAS A LONG BRIDGE.  CAR IS NOW AT DEALER WAITING FOR MON APPT.  *TR",

I DID NOT NOTICE ANY EFFECT ON DRIVEABILITY AS A RESULT OF THE TRACTION LIGHT BEING ILLUMINATED. UPON INVESTIGATION ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THESE LIGHTS BEING LIT WAS A FAILURE OF A \"ABS TONE RING\"; SURE ENOUGH WHEN I JACKED UP THE CAR AND LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THESE TOOTHED RINGS JUST INSIDE THE WHEEL BEARING/STEERING KNUCKLE HOUSING, I FOUND THAT THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE RING WAS BROKEN WITH ABOUT A 1/16 TO 3/32\" GAP. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE IS REPORTED TO BE CORROSION OF THE STEEL HUB THAT THE RING IS PRESSED ONTO. THE CORROSION CAUSES THE RING TO BE STRESSED BY THE EXPANSION OF THE AREA UNDER THE RING AS THE IRON TURNS TO RUST, PROBABLY ENHANCED BY THE COPIOUS AMOUNT OF ROAD SALT USED IN PA IN THE WINTER FOR ICE AND SNOW MELTING. REPORTED COSTS TO REPAIR THIS POORLY DESIGNED ENGINEERING FIASCO ARE IN THE $500-700 RANGE AT A DEALERS SHOP AND IRONICALLY THE RING ITSELF IS AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT $7-15.  *TR",

I HAD A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE & TIRE BALANCING ON FRI, 04/01/11 AT MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP & BY THE FOLLOWING THURS, HAD NOTICED A SOMEWHAT LARGE LEAKING-SPOT ON MY GARAGE FLOOR & A FRIENDS ASPHALT DRIVEWAY.  MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO AUTOMATICALLY RELATE THIS DARK OIL-LIKE RESIDUE, TO THE RECENT OIL CHANGE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS LEAK/SPOT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM JUST BEHIND THE FRONT BUMPER ON THE PASSENGER-SIDE, WHICH DIDN'T JIVE WITH THE TYPICAL LOCATION OF A MORE CENTERED OIL-LEAK. NONETHELESS, MY FORD ADVISOR ASSUMED THE SAME THING I WAS; THAT THE PLUG OR FILTER WAS PROBABLY LOOSE & TO BRING IT IN FOR IMMEDIATE CORRECTION.  HERE'S WHERE THE SHOCK & UTTER DISBELIEF BEGAN. I WAS TOLD MY ISSUE WAS NOT RELATED TO THE RECENT OIL CHANGE, BUT IN FACT A TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAK FROM A TRANSMISSION COOLER. I WAS ALSO TOLD THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE 36K WARRANTY, SINCE I WAS NOW AT 37,099; NOR WAS IT UNDER THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY.  I WAS THEN TAKEN BACK TO MY CAR WHERE THE TECH EXPLAINED THAT THIS \"COOLER\" LOOKS LIKE A REALLY THIN RADIATOR, BUT IS ACTUALLY A SEPARATE COOLING UNIT THAT SITS JUST IN FRONT OF THE RADIATOR. I WAS THEN TOLD THE LEAK IS A RESULT OF THE CONSTANT VIBRATION OF THIS UNIT HITTING THE RADIATOR, WHICH EVENTUALLY CRACKS THE LEFT (PASSENGER-SIDE) BOLT AREA. HE ALSO SAID THIS IS A COMMON REPAIR & THAT IT ONLY HAPPENS AROUND THE LEFT BOLT, NOT THE RIGHT. I THEN ASKED HOW IT WASN'T GOING TO REOCCUR IF IT'S A KNOWN DEFECT. HE REPLIED THAT FORD KNOWS ABOUT IT & HAS NOW INCLUDED A SMALL RUBBER BUSHING THAT COMES WITH THE NEW REPLACEMENT UNIT THAT SOMEHOW ABSORBS AND/OR PREVENTS THE VIBRATION. I WAS INITIALLY TOLD THIS WAS A $650 + REPAIR, BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, THE ADVISOR WAS ABLE TO GET FORD TO APPROVE MY COST AT $200. IT WASN'T $0, BUT BETTER THAN OTHERS; SO, \"HOW IS THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT, NOT A RECALL?\".  *TR",

AFTER DESCRIBING MY PROBLEM, HE QUICKLY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND MENTIONED THAT HE HAS HAD QUIET A FEW PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM. HE SAID THAT IT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE'S COOLANT PUMP. I DID SOME RESEARCH SAW SEVERAL POSTINGS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. IT REALLY CONCERNS ME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CASES OF THIS OCCURRING AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM MY DEALER OR FORD THAT THIS IS GOING ON, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE TOYOTA SCANDAL. *TR",

I NEVER DID ANYTHING WITH MY TIRES AND IT RAN BEAUTIFUL.

IN MY CASE, THE COOLER DEVELOPED A LEAK SHORTLY AFTER 37,800 MILES OF USE.  THE LEAK CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION OIL TO DROP BELOW AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.  I NOTICED THE SLIP WHEN ENTERING ONTO A HIGHWAY (US RT 22).  THE SLIP CAUSED A MAJOR DELAY IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE VEHICLE AND ALMOST RESULTED IN MAJOR ACCIDENT.  I HAD MY 2 YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME.     THE TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER IS CURRENTLY BEING REPLACED.  ALTHOUGH THE PART APPEARS TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE TRANSMISSION IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S 5YR/50,000 MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.

AND I DO HAVE A RATHER LONG CONCRETE DRIVEWAY FROM THE ROAD.  I ASKED FOR COPIES OF THE PAPERWORK THE  DEALERSHIP HAD FOR FORD BUT THEY REFUSED TO GIVE IT TO ME SAYING IT WAS PRIVATE. IRONICALLY THE DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $660.00 TO REPLACE THE WINDOW WHEN I HAVE A 3 YR 30,000 BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY IF THEY GET IT FROM FORD IT WOULD TAKE 2 WKS BUT THEY COULD IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE QUICKER FOR AN ADDITIONAL $25 AND GET IT IN 1 DAY. SO IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE THEY KNEW IT WAS A FAULTY GLASS.  THEY DID NOTHING TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER THEY TOLD ME TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY. WE HAVE DONE A INTERNET SEARCH AND IRONICALLY THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR SUNROOFS SHATTER BUT TO NO AVAIL FORD HAS DONE NOTHING TO FIX THE MATTER. I WAS JUST LUCKY I WASN'T DRIVING AT THE TIME. LIKE THE OTHER CONSUMERS ON THE FORUM PAGES. *TR",

I ASKED ABOUT IT BEING COVERED UNDER THE 5YR. 60,000 MI. POWER TRAIN WARRANTY BECAUSE IT IS CALLED A TRANSMISSION COOLER, AGAIN I WAS TOLD NO. NOW I AM SURE NOT A ROCKET SCIENTIST BUT TO ME A TRANSMISSION COOLER SOUNDS AS IF IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TRANSMISSION OPERATION! MY ARGUMENTS WITH THE SERVICE ADVISOR PROVED FRUITLESS.

THE END RESULT IS THE REPAIR COST MY DAUGHTER $667.04. WHEN I ASKED TO SEE THE OLD PART THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANIC HELD ONTO IT BECAUSE EACH MECHANIC KEEPS OLD PARTS TO SELL AS SCRAP. I WENT BACK AND GOT THE OLD TRANS.

SHE GOT IN THE VEHICLE ON WED, JUNE 6 AND WHEN SHE WENT TO START IT, IT WAS LOCKED UP.  NOTHING WORKED TO GET THE STEERING, ETC. TO WORK.  SHE SAID IT WAS LOCKED IN ADVANTRAC MODE.  THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED IN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA, WHERE SHE WORKS.  THEY HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE EVER SINCE, AND IT TOOK THEM 2 1/2 DAYS TO GET A DIAGNOSIS TO DO WITH THE POWER STEERING COLUMN.  THEY SAY PARTS WILL NOT BE AVAILAABLE UNTIL JULY 5, 2007, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.  HER CAR PAYMENT IS DUE BEFORE THEN, AND SHE HAS ONLY DRIVEN 240+ MILES.  I BELIEVE THERE WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE, OR IT WAS NOT INSPECTED PROPERLY BEFORE BEING SOLD.  THEY SAY THE PARTS ARE ON BACKORDER, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MORE PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE THAN THEY WILL ADMIT.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FORD CANCEL OUR PURCHASE, AND TAKE THIS DEFECTIVE VEHICLE BACK.  I DO NOT WANT TO WORRY ABOUT MY DAUGHTER DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND IT LOCKING UP, CAUSING  A ROLLOVER,ETC.  I THINK THIS VEHICLE WAS DEFECTIVE AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO KEEP IT .  WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET HELP, I WILL PROBABLY CALL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA TOMORROW.  I AM VERY UPSET OVER THIS HAPPENING, AND FEEL THAT WE GOT CONNED INTO BUYING A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE, SO WE SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR OUR TROUBLE, AND RELEASED FROM THIS PURCHASE.
