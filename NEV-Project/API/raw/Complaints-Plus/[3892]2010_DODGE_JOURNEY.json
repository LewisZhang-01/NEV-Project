SHORTLY AFTER BUYING IT I NOTICED THE HORN AND ALARM SYSTEM WOULD RANDOMLY GO OFF ON ITS OWN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, STATIONARY AT A STOP OR WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED AND TURNED OFF. I, UNFORTUNATELY, HAD TO ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM BY TAKING OUT THE FUSES FOR MY HORM AND ALARM SYSTEM. THIS HAS CAUSED SOME SAFETY ISSUES.     I HAVE ALSO HAD ANOTHER ELECTRICAL ISSUE THAT HAS COST ME OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. MY CAR BATTERY WOULD DRAIN OVERNIGHT. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD BATTERY BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AFTER I GOT MY CAR. I REPLACED THE BATTERY AND THAT HELPED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS. THEN THE BATTERY STARTED DRAINING AGAIN AND HAD TO BE JUMP STARTED EVERY DAY. I HAD IT HOOKED UP TO A DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE WHERE IT WAS FOUND THAT MY ALTERNATOR NEEDED CHANGED. WENT AHEAD AND DID THAT AND STILL HAD TO JUMP MY CAR EVERY DAY. I DID THIS FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS STRAIGHT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG. FINALLY DID A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH AND FOUND IT COULD BE THE FUSE BOX MODULE. BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE AND PUT IT IN. ALSO HAD TO BUY A NEW BATTERY DUE TO HAVING TO JUMP START IT OVER AND OVER FOR 2 MONTHS. COSTING AROUND $900 FOR THE BOTH. THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT THEN THE BATTERY STARTED DRAINING AGAIN. THIS TIME I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC. THEY RAN TESTS AND HAD MY CAR FOR 4 DAYS. THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT FOR SURE WHAT WAS WRONG BUT THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS IN MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER. WOULD COST $600 FOR THE PART AND $200 FOR INSTALLATION. I DECIDED TO JUST PULL MY MAIN ELECTRICAL FUSE EVERYDAY INSTEAD AND CONTINUE ON WITH MY CRAP CAR. COME TO FIND OUT 5 MONTHS LATER MY FRIEND DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AND IT WAS THE RADIO DRAINING THE BATTERY. SURE ENOUGH WE UNHOOKED MY RADIO COMPLETELY AND I HAVEN'T HAD AN ISSUE SINCE!!",

SO I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED ($130) AND THE STARTER REPLACED. IF I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND TRY TO START IT AGAIN 10 MINS LATER IT WONT START BUT IF YOU WAIT ABOUT AN HOUR, IT WILL START. THIS STILL HAPPENS AFTER HAVING THE STARTER REPLACED SO I HAVE TO KEEP THE CAR RUNNING OR RISK BEING STRANDED FOR AN HOUR OR SO. SECOND PROBLEM, ABOUT A MONTH AFTER BUYING THE VEHICLE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND WAS USING THE CRUISE CONTROL, WAS GOING DOWN A HILL AND THE RPMS WENT ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE RED AND HIGH AS IT COULD THEN WENT DOWN TO ZERO AND THE ENGINE COMPLETLY STALLED WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY. SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T USED THE CRUISE CONTROL. THIRDLY, THE PASSANGER SIDE HAS ZERO HEAT. THE DEFROSTER, THE HEAT VENTS ON THE DASH AND THE HEAT VENTS AT THE FEET ALL BLOW OUT COLD AIR. FOURTH PROBLEM, THE HORN WOULD HONK RANDOMLY, WHILE DRIVING OR PARKED. 5TH PROBLEM THE KEY FOB DOES WHAT IT WANTS WHEN IT WANTS. CAME OUT OF THE MALL AND MY ALARM WAS GOING OFF (JUST THE LIGHTS I HAD TO REMOVE THE HORN FUSES BECAUSE OF THE HONKING ISSUE) AND COULD NOT TURN THE ALARM OFF OR UNLOCK THE DOORS WITH THE FOB, HAD TO USE THE ACTUAL KEY FROM INSIDE THE FOB TO GET IN THE CAR AND THEN START IT, SHUT IF OFF THEN I WAS ABLE TO SHUT OFF THE ALARM. 6TH PROBLEM THE CAR WILL RANDOMLY UNLOCK WHEN I'M NOT EVEN HOLDING THE KEY FOB AND THE FRONT WINDOWS WILL ROLL DOWN HALF WAY. THIS CAR HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT ISSUES SINCE I BOUGHT IT DODGE NEEDS TO HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE THERE ARE SO MANY SAFETY ISSUES! BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE I WANTED A SAFE VEHICLE FOR MY FAMILY AND THIS CAR HAD BEEN ANYTHING BUT!",

CALLED DODGE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, BUT THEIR RESPONSE IS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THIS PROBLEM AND THAT APPARENTLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE VEHICLE MY WIFE USES TO GO TO WORK AND TAKE THE KIDS AROUND. I'VE READ THAT SOME PEOPLE, THEIR VEHICLES, JUST STOPPED WORKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET WHILE THEY WERE DRIVING. SUPER UNSAFE AND DODGE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MALFUNCTION.",

THEY ALSO STATED THE REASON MY HORN DIDN'T WORK WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE TOOK OUT THE FUSE. WHEN THEY PUT THE FUSE BACK IN, MY HORN WOULD RANDOMLY GO OFF NO MATTER IF IT WAS PARKED OR IF I WAS DRIVING IT.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK HOME AND SURE ENOUGH, LESS THAN A WEEK LATER, SAME ISSUE.

I WAS IN 5PM TRAFFIC WITH 2 KIDS, ALMOST CAUSED A WRECK TRYING TO GET OVER TO A PARKING LOT. MY STEERING WHEEL WOULD HARDLY MOVE! HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED AGAIN TO THE DODGE DEALERSHIP.

ONCE THEY FINISHED WORKING ON IT THEY HORN BLOWS SPORADICALLY. AGAIN IN AUGUST 2016 I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO BETTENHAUSEN BECAUSE THE CAR BROKE DOWN. UPON BETTENHAUSEN REVIEWING MY CAR THEY STATED IT WAS THE HEATER HOSE, A GASKET AND THE ANTI FREEZE BOTTLE HAD A HOLE IN IT. IT COST ME $582.00 FOR THAT REPAIR. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ALSO INFORMED ME THAT I NEEDED FRONT AND REAR MOTOR MOUNTS BROKEN, FRONT AND REAR STRUTS BLOWN OUT, FRONT AND REAR BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS WARPED AND WORN, RIGHT REAR WHEELING BEARING EXCESSIVE NOISE. THESE ARE MAJOR REPAIRS AND WILL COST MAJOR MONEY. WHY DIDN'T BETTENHAUSEN INSPECT MY CAR THOROUGHLY IN JUNE WHEN IT WAS TOWED IN? I THINK THESE THINGS WERE WRONG WITH THE CAR IN JUNE BUT IT WAS INSPECTED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. SO I DROVE AROUND FOR MONTHS WITH ALL THIS WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE.

THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER THE CAR JUST STATED RANDOMLY HONKING IT HORN ON ITS OWN! NOW THIS IS ALL HAPPENING WHILE CAR WAS PARKED IN DRIVEWAY. I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE MAYBE IT WAS PART OF THE SECURITY ON THE CAR AND THEN IT STOPPED ABOUT 5 MINS LATER. WHILE STILL PARKED. LATER ON IN THE DAY I TOOK THE CAR OUT TO DO SOME THINGS WHEN IT STARTED RANDOMLY HONKING IT OWN HORN. THIS WAS ALL HAPPENING WHILE I WAS ON A MAJOR ROAD. THIS THEN CREATED A VERY DANGEROUS MOMENT BECAUSE I GOT DISTRACTED BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE HELL MY CAR JUST STARTED RANDOMLY HONKING IT HORN AND IT WOULDN'T STOP FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. MULTIPLE PEOPLE STOPPED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS HONKING AT THEM WHICH CAUSED THINGS TO GET VERY CRAZY. SO NOW I KNOW SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT, SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THE CAR BACK HOME FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY AND WELL BEING.SO NOW THE CAR IS BACK HOME AND THE RANDOM HONKING HAS STOPPED. WE ALL WENT TO BED, AND AT 12:00 PM THURSDAY NIGHT. IT HAPPENED AGAIN WHILE PARKED IN DRIVEWAY,IT WOULD BEEP AND BEEP AND THEN STOP AND BEEP AGAIN AND THEN IT WOULDN'T STOP BEEPING AND THEN IT WOULDN'T STOP. NOW I THEN GOT REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE THIS JUST ISN'T SAFE AND IS ANNOYING FOR THE POOR NEIGHBORS TRYING TO SLEEP. SO LUCKILY ABOUT 10 MINS LATER THE HONKING HAD STOPPED. I WENT BACK TO SLEEP HOPING IT WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. NOW ITS FRIDAY THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY HONKING FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS WHILE ITS BEEN PARKED IN DRIVEWAY ALL NIGHT. NOW THROUGH THE WHOLE FRIDAY NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN UNTIL ABOUT 7:00 PM, IT HAPPENED AGAIN THE CAR STARTED BEEPING ITS HORN AND THIS TIME FOR ABOUT 10 MINS RANDOMLY DURING THAT TIME WHILE IT WAS PARKED. KNOWING THAT THIS WASN'T GOING TO STOP I TOOK OUT HORN FUSES FOR NOW,BUT NOW I HAVE NO HORN!",

I WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THE KEY AND SIT FOR SOMETIMES UP TO 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CAR WOULD TURN OVER. AT THIS TIME THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND AT THE SAME TIME WE STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH THE PASSENGER WINDOW NOT ROLLING DOWN OR UP WITH THE BUTTON ON THE PASSENGER DOOR. DRIVER SIDE COULD ROLL THE WINDOW UP. WE TOOK IT IN AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP COULDN'T MIMIC THE PROBLEMS WE WERE HAVING THE TOLD US THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND SAID BRING IT BACK WHEN WE HAVE THE ISSUE AGAIN. SERIOUSLY HOW CAN I BRING YOU THE CAR WHEN IT WONT START. ON TO THE NEXT PROBLEM LAST OCTOBER DRIVING HOME ON THE FREEWAY GOING 60 MILES AND HOUR AT NIGHT MIGHT I ADD AND MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM STARTS TO FAIL LIGHTS TURN OFF RADIO TURNS OFF AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNS BACK ON THANKFULLY I WAS ALMOST HOME SO MY HUSBAND LOOKED AT IT AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE THANKFULLY BUT NOW WE ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH OUR RADIO TWO DAYS AGO IT STOPPED WORKING AGAIN. FIRST TIME MY HUSBAND GOGGLE THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY FOR AN HOUR AND THEN RECONNECT. THIS TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THIS TIME AROUND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. SO KNOW I HAVE TO TAKE MY CAR IN TO HAVE THIS DIAGNOSED AGAIN. I WONT EVEN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE CLICKING THAT COMES FROM BEHIND THE GLOVE BOX WHEN I TURN THE AC OR HEAT ON SOUNDS LIKE MY CAR IS GOING TO BLOW UP.

IN NOV 2014, WHILE ENTERING THE INTERSTATE EXIT MY CAR SHUT OFF GOING 35MPH AROUND A DEEP CURVE. I LOST ALL CONTROL OF STEERING AND ACCELERATION, BRAKES LOCKED UP.

COMING HOME OFF INTERSTATE W/ KIDS IN CAR, CAR SHUT OFF WHILE GOING 40 MPH IN MID CURVE! NOW BEGINNING FEB 2015, MY BATTERY GOES DEAD REPEATEDLY. I'VE HAD TO HAVE IT JUMPED OFF ALMOST EVERY MORNING FOR LAST MONTH. I TOOK IT TO AUTO STORE AND BATTERY TESTED GOOD. MARCH 2015, BATTERY GOING DEAD AGAIN.

HE COULDN'T GO BEYOND THIS POINT TO FIX BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT'S SOMETHING IN COMPUTER SYSTEM? I TOOK TO DEALER AND AFTER I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING TO THEM & BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR WEEK, THEY INSISTED IT BATTERY WAS BAD. SO WE HAVE REPLACED BATTERY, YET THEY DID NOT ADDRESS RANDOM ALARM/HORN. SO I TOOK BACK SAME DAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE B/C IT WILL CONTINUE. THEY NOW ARE SUGGESTING TO REPLACE HORN SWITCH OF WHICH AFTER LOOKING AT OTHER CONSUMERS I DON'T THINK WILL FIX THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE CARS COMPUTER TRIGGERING THE ALARM BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY REFUSE TO CHECK THAT.  I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET AS MUCH MONEY FROM RESETTING COMPUTER OR NOT.  I KNOW I DON'T HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY ON TRAIL & ERROR.

THEN THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID CHRYSLER SUPPLIES DEFECTIVE PARTS. WOW. IS THIS OK TO DO...WE PAY THOUSANDS FOR A VEHICLE AND CHRYSLER SUPPLIES DEFECTIVE PARTS??? WE TAKE IT BACK AND THEY FIX YET AGAIN. HOURS LATER, YOU GUESSED IT WE ARE BACK AGAIN AND THEY TELL US THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSED. WE TAKE IT BACK THIS MONDAY AFTER THEY LET US DRIVE OFF IN AN UNSAFE VEHICLE AND THEY TELL US IT'S THE BREAKS AND SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE $700. THEN THEY TAKE IT APART AND SAY ITS NOT THAT PUT IT BACK TOGETHER TEST DRIVE IT AND TELL US IT'S THE MASTER SOLENOID AND IT WILL BE $1000. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF DODGE. I CALLED THE HELPLINE ONLY FOR THEM TO TELL ME A SUPERVISOR WILL CALL IN 1 BUSINESS DAY. 4 BUSINESS DAYS LATER I CALL THEM BACK AND GET A\"SUPERVISOR\" WHO WILL \"LOOK INTO \" MY ISSUES. I AM DONE. FILING A LAW SUIT, CALLING LOCAL TV STATIONS,  ENOUGH DODGE!!! DO THE RIGHT THING, READ THESE POSTS AND FIX THESE ISSUES. WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON YOUR CRAPPY PRODUCT ONLY TO BE GOUGED OVER AND OVER. YOUR RECALLS NEVER END. YOUR SERVICE IS HORRIFIC. MAYBE YET ANOTHER CLASS ACTION WILL SOLVE THIS.

THE FIRST TIME OF SUCH INCIDENT HAPPENED WITHIN 1 YEAR OF OWNERSHIP WHILE WE WERE AT TURNING SIGNAL, THE VEHICLE LOST TURNING SIGNAL CAUSED CONFUSION TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, AND SINCE THEN EVERY FEW MONTHS OR SO THIS INCIDENT HAPPENS, THE DEALER DID MULTIPLE REPAIR TO IT, BUT NEVER REALLY SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

THEY PAID FOR RENTALS FOR OVER A YEAR MAKING ME PICK UP MY CAR AND RETURN THE RENTAL UNTIL IT DOES IT AGAIN, AS THEY COULD ONLY AUTHORIZE RENTALS ONE MONTH AT A TIME. THIS CONTINUED FOR OVER A YEAR THEN ONCE MY CAR MADE 100,000 MILES THE DEALER STATED IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, IT WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO IT COULD NOT BE FIXED. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY ARE WORKING WITH FOWLER DODGE(DEALER) WHO STATES THEY ARE OUT OF OPTIONS. THIS VEHICLE IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURE DEFECT AND CAN NOT BE FIXED. THE DEALER WAS AWARE IN THE VERY BEGINNING AND FAILED TO RECALL THIS DEFECTIVE VEHICLE. I'M NOW AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM CHRYSLER CASE MANAGER WHO STATES IS GOING TO GET CORPORATE INVOLVED, PLEASE HELP! PS. I'M STILL IN RENTALS AT THEIR EXPENSE.   *TR",

ON 5 MARCH 2014, MY WIFE NOTICED THAT THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHT WAS ACTIVATED. I ATTRIBUTED THE SIGNAL TO THE LOW AIR TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS BELOW 0 DEGREE F.  ON   6 MARCH 2014 AFTER I DROVE THE CAR IN  20+ DEGREES F. THE WARNING LIGHT REMAINED ACTIVATED.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL TIRE SHOP TO HAVE THE TIRE PRESSURE CHECKED BY THE PROFESSIONAL. THE OWNER/TECHNICIAN CHECKED THE AIR PRESSURE IN ALL TIRES.  WHILE CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE, ONE RETAINING NUT (LOCATED ON THE OUTSIDE TIRE RIM) WHICH HOLDS THE TIRE SENSOR MONITOR (LOCATED INSIDE THE TIRE) SPLIT, AND ONE HALF OF THE NUT FELL ONTO THE FLOOR.

THE TECHNICIAN/OWNER EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, AND WHAT THE RESULTS COULD BE IF THE SENSOR MONITOR WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLACE.

THIS, ON ITS OWN, MAY NOT BE OVERLY MONUMENTAL, BUT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS INVOLVED THAT I BELIEVE NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO PUBLIC ATTENTION.    FIRST, THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW OFF THE LOT 2 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 11 INCIDENT.

CHRYSLER NEEDS TO RECALL THIS VEHICLE AGAIN!!!  CHRYSLER LEGAL, TOLD ME IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN!    SECOND, CHRYSLER LEGAL DEPARTMENT IS BEING EXTREMELY CURT, AND UNHELPFUL IN RESOLVING THINGS FOR US.  THEY ARE 'ALLOWING' US TO KEEP OUR CURRENT LOAN IN PLACE (FOR THE CAR THAT EXPLODED) AND 'GIVING' US THE CURRENT MSRP ON THAT CAR (A 2010) TO FIND ANOTHER NEW CHRYSLER VEHICLE.  THEN, THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT REIMBURSE A PERCENTAGE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT WERE IN THE CAR....LIKE MY 2 BRITAX CAR SEATS!

IN ADDITION, THE BRAKES DON'T SEEM TO BE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WITH 3 SEPARATE RECALL/WARRANTY NOTICES FOUND WHICH APPEAR TO COVER BRAKES, DASHBOARD LIGHTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE STARTER ISSUE.  THE DEALER STATED THEY WERE AWARE OF ONLY 1 RECALL.  THEY INDICATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NEAR CLOSING TIME, THEY COULD NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES UNTIL MONDAY. MY DAUGHTER AND HER 2 INFANTS USE THIS CAR. WHEN I PURCHASED IT, THE DEALER MENTIONED IT HAD BEEN 'RETURNED' AND HAD VERY LOW MILEAGE.  WHEN ASKED WHY IT WAS RETURNED, THEY STATED THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER BOUGHT MANY VEHICLES FROM THEM, AND JUST NEEDED SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF AN ACCIDENT RESULTING FROM THE VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHILE IN MOTION NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT NO ONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

AFTER NAMES AND SO FORTH WERE EXCHANGED [ BOTH VEHICLES WERE RENTALS] THE DODGE WAS RESTARTED AND RAN FINE INTO THE RETURN AREA. WHILE THEY WERE CHECKING IT IN AND THE VEHICLE RETURN AGENT WAS SHOWN THE DAMAGE HE WENT OVER TO CHECK THE GAS LEVEL. UNDERSTAND, AGAIN AT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO ONE INSIDE THE RENTAL VEHICLE AT ALL. EVERYONE WAS OUTSIDE STANDING AROUND. AS THE CAR RENTAL AGENT STARTED TO LOOK INSIDE THE ENGINE STARTED RACING AGAIN, IN FACT HE ACTUALLY JUMPED BACK AND I REACHED IN AND SHUT IT DOWN. THIS WAS REPORTED TO THE INSURANCE PEOPLE AND AFTER SEVERAL CALLS THE FINALLY SAID THAT THE RENTAL COMPANY HAD INSPECTED THE CAR BY TAKING IT TO A DEALER WHO LOOKED AT THE ENGINE AND TEST DROVE IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED SO THE VEHICLE WAS ALRIGHT. THE AGENT WHO CHECKED IT IN WAS NEVER CONTACTED AND NONE OF THE PEOPLE IN EITHER VEHICLE WERE ASKED ABOUT THE ENGINE RACING. I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING 6 OR 7 THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE A CAR APART BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS A BOX THAT CAN TELL WHAT WAS GOING ON JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE INSPECTION WAS DONE BY A DEALERSHIP AT A COST OF $105.00 SO IT WAS NOT EXTREMELY WELL INSPECTED. *TR",
