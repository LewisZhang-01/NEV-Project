        "summary": "Brake pads have excessive squealing. Squealing implies incorrect pressure to rotor to stop the vehicle, which highly concerns me as an operator.   According to the dealer where I reported the issue, there is a technical bulletin that approves replacement of the brake pads for free if reported in first 7500 miles. My truck exceeded that mileage when I noticed the squealing. If this was a recall for the defective brakes, the dealer would cover the costs to repair, but not for a technical bulletin according to the service department, and confirmed by GMC.   I now have to pay $1500 to replace brakes on a new truck with 15000 miles on it, or risk my safety. I believe this should be a recall and appreciate any assistance in this matter.",
