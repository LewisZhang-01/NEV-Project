        "summary": "The automated braking system deployed at maximum braking without warning 3 times in 60 miles of highway driving (this was the first time I had driven this car on a highway). The road in front was completely clear of both cars and debris for several miles, it was sunny without glare, and the road was dry. The one common factor was that all 3 times occurred while passing a semi truck, as I pulled level with the cab. I was thrown forward against the seatbelt while the car slammed on its brakes while beeping and flashing the orange 'BRAKE' warning, dropping from highway speeds by about 25 mph before I was able to intervene. Thankfully there was also no traffic behind me, so I was able to recover control of the vehicle, but otherwise this would have absolutely caused a collision.  Prior to this incident, there were no warning signs or indications of a problem. I had purchased the vehicle as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle less than a week before, at which point it had been thoroughly inspected by the dealership and certified as free from issues.  I have reported the issue to the dealership, but from cursory searching online it appears this is a known, unremediated issue - a quote from Wilde East Towne Honda (not my dealer): \"You may find that CMBS is giving you notifications and even feedback when no threat is detected. That is normal on occasions...CMBS picks up 'optical illusions' occasionally\"",

        "summary": "I purchased a new Honda Fit in 2018. In November 2019, at 31,000 miles several indicator lights came on. The check engine, TPMS, Vehicle Stability assist, Electric Power System. The car was running smoothly but I was told by a Honda dealer there was excessive carbon build up. The cost to clean it out would be $500. They claimed that because this was caused by an outside element and a part had not failed that the warranty would not cover this. I fought it and they did a one-time courtesy repair at no charge.  June 2021, 51,000 miles and the same thing happened all over again. Car running smoothly, no hesitation, no misfires. Different Honda dealer told me it was excessive carbon build up on manifold and this time it would be $604 plus tax. I asked if there was a maintenance service that would prevent this from happening and I was told no. That the fuel system service offered does not reach the areas of the engine where the carbon builds up. This is a problem with Direct Injection engines.  Clearly there is a flaw in the direct injection engine design that Honda has known about for years and does not want to take responsibility for. This is unacceptable and Honda is committing consumer fraud by knowingly selling a flawed product that jeopardizes the safety of their customers.  I do not feel safe driving this car with these failures in the engine, not knowing when this problem is going to happen again and facing an expensive repair bill every time it does happen. Not to mention the inconvenience of being without a car for several days while it is being repaired.   I have documentation to back all of this up.",

BY EARLY FEBRUARY I HAD DEVELOPED AN INJURY THAT I WILL DETAIL BELOW BUT WHICH WAS ENTIRELY A RESULT OF DRIVING THE CAR I HAD JUST BOUGHT. I HAVE NOW NOT DRIVEN THE FIT AT ALL SINCE APRIL 18 AND DESPITE SEVERAL MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS (DOCUMENTS ATTACHED), I REMAIN IN DAILY PAIN. MY GP HAS DIRECTED ME TO SEE AN ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALIST WHO I WILL BE SEEING THIS AFTERNOON.     THE DRIVER-SIDE SEAT BELT TONGUE IN THE 2018 HONDA FIT IS PARTICULARLY LARGE & HEAVY; I WAS TOLD BY HONDA SERVICE THAT THE SIZE IS A RESULT OF DRIVER-SIDE SAFETY SENSORS. THE DRIVER-SIDE SEAT BELT BUCKLE IS LOCATED HIGH ON THE SIDE OF THE SEAT & WHEN BUCKLED (WHETHER STANDING STILL OR IN MOTION), THE WEIGHT & SIZE OF THE TONGUE PULLS THE ENTIRE MECHANISM AT A PARTICULARLY SHARP ANGLE TOWARD THE DRIVER. IN MY CASE, THE SEAT BELT TONGUE-&-BUCKLE HITS MY RIGHT HIP AT SUCH AN ANGLE THAT IT AGGRAVATES A NERVE AND RESULTS IN BOTH IMMEDIATE & LASTING PAIN.     I BEGAN TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BY ASKING HONDA SERVICE TO ADJUST THE SEAT BELT BUT THREE GOOD-FAITH EFFORTS ON THEIR PART DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM; THE DEALERSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT I WENT TO SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO UPSELL ME TO A MORE EXPENSIVE CAR; TWO SEPARATE EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE VIA AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE RESULTED IN BEING TOLD THAT AS THE PART WAS NOT DEFECTIVE, THEY WOULD NOT BE HELPING ME (SCREENSHOT OF PRIVATE EXCHANGE ON TWITTER, ATTACHED.)     FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, ALL I'VE ASKED FOR IS EITHER A DIFFERENT SEAT BELT WITH A DIFFERENT TONGUE-&-BUCKLE MECHANISM, OR A TRADE-IN FOR AN EARLIER MODEL WITH A DIFFERENT SEAT BELT, AND AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND THE FRANCHISE LEVEL, NO ONE WAS WILLING TO WORK WITH ME IN EITHER DIRECTION.",
