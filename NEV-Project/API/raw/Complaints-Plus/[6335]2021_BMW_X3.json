I immediately looked for a place to park or exit.  I thought maybe someone was shooting at our vehicle in the freeway.  I tried changing lane as quickly as possible to exit into Baseline Rd and parked at a parking lot.   I was so scared looking at the mirror to see if anyone was following us.  We walked around the SUV checking the windows, windshield but no broken glass or holes on any of them.  I thought of the moonroof/sunroof so I hopped on the BMW to check the moonroof/sunroof.   The sunroof  shattered into million pieces.  I didn't see a warning on the dashboard.  We didn't go under any bridge between Elliott and Baseline.  There were no big trucks around us either. It shattered without warning.  This happened between 11:00am - 11:30am, light traffic.  My BMW X3 2021 is brand new, only 20 days old and approximately 400 or so miles.  I believe it's a safety issue with the glass or moonroof/sunroof structural defect.  Definitely a highway safety hazard when it shattered out of the blue at 65 miles an hour. Luckily we didn't have the sunroof open. It's  extremely hot this time of the year in Phoenix.   I decided to drive it immediately to The BMW dealership.  The service department checked it out and the Service Advisor told me to call my insurance.  I contacted the BMW Warranty Department and the Manager told me it is not covered under warranty.  She was making the assumption that a rock hit the sunroof.  I contacted BMW Customer Service and reported it.   The BMW Customer Service Executive called me back today and pretty much said the same thing as the Warranty Manager.   BMW and NHTSA should investigate the occurrences of Sunroof shattering without any apparent reason for the safety of drivers and passengers plus all the other drivers on the road who may get impacted by such an occurrence.",

BMW REPLACED IT WITH A INTERIOR BRIGHTNESS SENSOR IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ABOVE THE GAS GAUGE. THE DANGER INCURS BECAUSE THE SCREEN KEEPS CHANGING BRIGHTNESS IN THE DAYTIME BASED UPON LIGHT ENTERING THE AUTO AND HITTING THE LIGHT SENSOR.  THIS HAPPENS COMING OUT OF A GARAGE, TREE LINED STREET, CLOUDY DAY ETC.  THE DANGER IS THAT YOU CANNOT OBSERVE THINGS CLEARLY USING THE BACK-UP CAMERA, AND USING NAVIGATION DURING THE DAYTIME YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT DIRECTIONS, ROADS, HIGHWAYS ETC BECAUSE THE SCREEN TURNS A DULL WHITE OR ALMOST GRAY AT TIMES.  THIS FORCES YOU TO STAR AT THE SCREEN OR GET CLOSER OR ASK YOUR PASSENGER TO READ THE SCREEN.  THE BRIGHT WHITE LETTERS AND NUMBERS GOES DULL AND UNREADABLE.  DEALERS AND SERVICE MANAGERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE BUT NO SOLUTION.  FORUMS IN EUROPE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM THAT BMW IS AWARE OF WITH NO INTENT ON CORRECTING.  IT WAS ALSO A PROBLEM ON MY 2019 BMW 530 BUT I HAD THE CAR CODED TO PUT THE DAYTIME ADJUSTMENT BACK ON THE MENU FOR DRIVER ADJUSTMENT.  COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ALSO FOR 2020 BMW X5 AND NO ONE HAS A RESOLUTION.  I GLUED A SMALL LED TO MY DASH THAT WILL FOOL THE SENSOR AND BRIGHTEN MY SCREEN BUT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO LEAVE THIS LIGHT ON AT ALL TIMES.  BMW NORTH AMERICA ACKNOWLEDGES MY ISSUE ALSO WITH NO SOLUTION.  DEALERS HAVE VERIFIED THIS WITH OTHER NEW CARS ON THEIR LOTS BUT ALSO WITH NO SOLUTION.
