        "summary": "I took my 2019 Nissan Frontier with 56,000 miles to the Freedom Nissan in south Burlington VT on 1/25/2022 due to the airbag light flashing red.  Scanned the vehicle and found DTC B00A0 - they preformed diagnosis on code. Found Occupant Sensor Failure. Will need to replace passenger seat bottom due to OCS sensor but within seat.   My complaint is that Nissan is not covering this serious safety issue under warranty because the truck's three year basic warranty expired November 13, 2021 and exceeded 36,000 miles.   I strongly disagree due the serious safety issue and with the long history of Nissan's Occupant Sensor Failures they have had over many years. I have called Nissan's customer service and was told they would not cover the cost to install a new bottom seat.  My case number with Nissan Customer Service is 45640533",

WE TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIRS. THE DEALER RE-BALANCED THE TIRES AND IT GOT A BIT BETTER BUT NOT GONE. WE LOOKED AT THE TIRES AND SAW THAT THEY CALL FOR UP TO 80PSI. WE INCREASED THE TIRE PRESSURE AND THE TRUCK BEGAN TO DRIVE BETTER BUT THE TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. WE RETURNED IT TO THE DEALER. THEY LOWERED THE PRESSURE TO 35PSI PER THE GUIDE ON THE DRIVER DOOR FRAME. THE TRUCK DROVE SLOPPY ON OUR TRIP HOME (APPX. 55 MILES). WE THEN CONTACTED THE TIRE MANUFACTURE (MICKEY THOMSON) THEY TOOK OUR INFORMATION AND SAID \"DO NOT RUN AT 35PSI. THIS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE.\" THEY SAID RUN AT 50PSI MINIMUM FOR THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE. THE TRUCK NOW DRIVES GOOD BUT THE TIRE WARNING LIGHT WILL NOT GO OUT. WE HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER MANY TIMES BUT HAVE YET TO GET A SOLUTION. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS TRUCK WAS NOT PROPERLY LABELED OR SET UP FOR THE TIRES IT WAS SOLD WITH AND THE TIRE WARNING SYSTEM IS NOW OF NO VALUE TO US SINCE IT STAYS ON ALL THE TIME. ALSO NONE OF THE DECALS FOR TIRE PRESSURE AND SIZE (FACTORY OR ROCKY RIDGE) DESCRIBE THE CORRECT SIZE OR TRUE SAFE OPERATION TIRE PRESSURE.",
