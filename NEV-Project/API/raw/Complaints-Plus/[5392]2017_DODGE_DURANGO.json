The Uconnect system allows the operator to select whether the function will provide an audible warning or brake automatically if an object behind the vehicle is detected by any of 4 sensors installed in the rear bumper. The function can also be enabled or disabled via a physical button below the Uconnect system.  I purchased the vehicle new and have owned the vehicle for 3 years. I have towed boats many times. Until recently, I was able to successfully use the touchscreen or physical button to disable the function when backing up with a trailer connected. Now I cannot disable the function or braking via either method. It appears to turn off for about 1 second before turning back on. I've tested in various conditions such as park/neutral, with/without a trailer, etc. to no avail.   I thought I would try resetting software in the rear parking assist controller, so I disconnected both batteries and removed the proper fuse, but that didn't fix the issue. That got me worried because the failsafe should be that if the control system goes bad, the function should be disabled. I believe this to be true, because sometimes you need to back up to avoid collisions with irresponsible drivers, etc. If you are towing a trailer, you wouldn't be able to back up if the system failed. I understand about failsafe design from working on safety-critical aircraft computers.  I reviewed the users manual and information online, and found that if connected to a trailer or exceeding 7 mph in reverse, the function should disengage. However, the function has NEVER, in 3 years, disengaged when towing a trailer, and I am unable to exceed 7 mph when towing due to the automatic braking. I tested this again by plugging a trailer into both factory-installed electrical receptacles provided with the tow package. I could not disable it. Other vehicle owners have the same issue.",

I COULD NOT MOVE OR PUSH THE VEHICLE AS ENGAGE THE NEUTRAL POSITION WAS NOT HAPPENING. AFTER CALLING THE TOW TRUCK AND SITTING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR (SCARED I'D GET HIM BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC) I LOOKED IN THE MANUAL AND ONLINE  TO SEE HOW TO MANUALLY ENGAGE THE NEUTRAL POSITION. AFTER A FEW FAILED ATTEMPTS I WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE IT AND MOVE IT SAFELY FROM THE STREET. TOW TRUCK ARRIVED AN HOUR LATER AND NOW NO BUTTONS WORKED. HE HAD TO USE THE MANUAL KEY TO UNLOCK DOORS AND THE DASH WAS LIGHTING UP WITH SEVERAL WARNINGS. GOING TOO FAST TO SEE OR DESCRIBE. APPT IS SCHEDULED FOR 5/28 PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED BECAUSE TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THIS EVENT GAS GAUGE INDICATED ALMOST EMPTY. WENT TO FILL UP AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO FILL 7.7 GALLONS BEFORE GAS PUMP INDICATED THE CAR WAS FULL.

THE TRUCK STARTED TO STEADILY DECREASE IN SPEED, THERE WERE NO OBJECTS IN THE PATH OF THE VEHICLE AND THE CAR IN FRONT WAS AT LEAST 6 CAR LENGTHS AHEAD. WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE, I THEN ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE, MY BRAKES WERE NOT ACTIVE AS WELL. I PLACED MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY TO MOVE MY VEHICLE FROM THE ROAD. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME MY STEERING HAD TIGHTENED AND I COULD NOT MOVE MY VEHICLE. I ENDED UP COASTING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD UNTIL MY VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP. NOTHING WAS WORKING ON MY TRUCK. I COULD NOT OPEN MY DOOR OR LET MY WINDOWS DOWN. IT WAS LIKE I WAS TRAPPED INSIDE. FINALLY, I WAS ABLE TO GET MY WINDOWS DOWN AFTER 3 OR MORE MINUTES. WHEN THE TOWING SERVICE PICKED MY VEHICLE UP, THE BACK WINDOWS WOULD NOT ROLL UP AND MY LIFT GATE OPENED BY ITSELF. WE GOT THE LIFT GATE BACK DOWN MANUALLY. HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. IF YOU PLACED YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE, PUSHED THE START BUTTON IT JUST MADE A CLICKING NOISE. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WILL BE LOOKED AT TOMORROW, 9/26/17. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE, FATAL ACCIDENT. SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE INTO THIS MATTER.
