        "summary": "My front cap has been leaking for about a year, and I have had it \"repaired\" three times already under warranty.  It is still leaking, and, in fact, it may be getting worse.  This cap contains, among other things, a nearly queen-sized bed for sleeping.  I have read on Thor forums that countless other owners are having similar problems, which stems from the front cap not being secured/installed correctly.  This includes missing seals and/or missing screws.  My fear is that this cap will continue to sag/loosen and eventually fall/break off while I am driving, or while someone is sleeping in this area.  This potentially could result in fatalities / loss of human life.",
