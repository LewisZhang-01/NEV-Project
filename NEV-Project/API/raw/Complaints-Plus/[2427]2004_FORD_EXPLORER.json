Brought to non-Ford mechanic for inspection(NYS ANNUAL) and passes but mechanic looked for a power steering pressure sending sensor or switch that is to give signal to EMC to increase idle to compensate for more power steer demands. Part is $35 at Partgeek but mechanics dont know where the harness the sending switch is located, if one exists or is it in power steering pump. Call Ford NADA! Call two local Ford dealers. One says dont work on cars 15 years old, other says go to liabary to get diagrams, Ford says obsolete parts in 10 years.Bummer! Husband ordered 8/10/20 New 2021 Bronco. Pushed into 2022 due to supply chain. Found out Bronco built at MAP same as Ranger, will not get stronger 10r80  transmission,but Explorer 10r60, 25% weaker ; and gets Explorer 2.3L  EgoBoost non- Ranger improved 4\u00d74 engine ,  although they say same transmission and improved engine as Ranger in ads. Ford Buit Tought?  MY2022! PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ISDUE. NO BRAKING NOR STEERING WHEN SENSON IN POWER STEERING STALLS 4.6L ENGINE.

        "summary": "MY 2004 FORD EXPLORER HAS RECENTLY AND QUICKLY BEGAN SHIFTING VERY BADLY. I ALWAYS COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL BEFORE SHIFTING INTO REVERSE OR DRIVE BECAUSE WHEN SHIFTING INTO REVERSE FROM P OR D, IT ALWAYS TAKES A WHILE, THEN CLUNKS AGGRESSIVELY INTO PLACE. WHILE DRIVING SOMETIMES DOWNSHIFTING WILL ALSO CLUNK INTO PLACE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BY COUNTLESS OTHER DRIVERS AND HAS CAUSED MANY POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. FROM ACCELERATING SLOWLY THEN BANGING GEARS AND TAKING OFF, TO STUTTERING WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE, OR EVEN SWITCHING INTO REVERSE WHILE PARKING, AND HAVING THE CAR TRY TO JUMP BACK A FEW INCHES IS ONLY A FEW ISSUES THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED MYSELF AND COUNTLESS OTHERS. PEOPLE ARE REPLACING TRANSMISSIONS LEFT AND RIGHT TO NO AVAIL, ONLY A FEW 10 THOUSAND MILES AFTER INSTALLING NEW TRANSMISSIONS, THEIR CAR STARTS TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUES AS BEFORE. AT LOW SPEEDS AND IN PARKING LOTS THIS BECOMES A GAME OF LUCK AS YOU ACCELERATE MORE THAN NECESSARY TO TRY TO GET GOING, THEN STOPPING AND WAITING A FEW SECONDS WHILE YOU SHIFT TO NEUTRAL BEFORE SHIFTING TO REVERSE AS FEAR OF IT BANGING INTO GEAR AS YOU TRY TO MANEUVER YOUR CAR AROUND PEOPLE AND OTHER PARKED CARS BECOMES A MORE DANGEROUS TASK THAN IT SHOULD BE. IN SUM, WHILE STATIONARY, SLOW SPEED, OR JUST CRUISING, THE TRANSMISSION WHILE SHIFTING GEARS, OR SHIFTING INTO REVERSE/DRIVE, SOMETIMES WANTS TO BANG INTO GEAR OR LOSE POWER, OR DELAY SHIFTING ONLY TO BANG INTO GEAR MOMENTS LATER. SOME ISSUES WHEN TAKING CARS INTO REPAIR IS FINDING METAL TRANSMISSION SHAVINGS WHERE THEY SHOULDNT BE! FINALLY, THE EXCESSIVE BANGING CAN ALSO DAMAGE THE ENGINE OVER TIME IN ADDITION TO THE TRANSMISSION.

THERE MAY  BE THOUSANDS OF EXPLORERS WITH THIS DEFECT, I SEE THEM EVERY DAY. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FORD COMPANY FOR NOT TAKING CARE OF THIS DEFECT. I HAVE PURCHASED MY LAST FORD.  *TR",

THIS RESULTED IN THE REAR GLASS WINDOW SHIFTING, APPARENTLY CAUSING THE CRACKS IN THE TAIL GATE. I CONTACTED SUNSHINE FORD'S SERVICE DEPT. IN NEWBURGH, NY AND WAS TOLD FORD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING/REPLACING THIS DEFECT. THEY CHOSE THEIR WORDS CAREFULLY. THEY EMPHASIZED THAT \"MY MODEL YEAR\" WAS NOT RECALLED FOR THIS DEFECT. I ASKED IF \"ANY\" EXPLORERS HAD A RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT. THEY WOULD NOT SAY; BUT INSTEAD REPEATED,\"MY MODEL YEAR\" WAS NOT RECALLED FOR THIS DEFECT.     NHTSA HAS ALREADY RECEIVED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OF INJURIES FROM OWNERS WHOSE LIFT GATE GLASS BROKE OFF ITS MOUNTING HINGE WHILE OPEN, AND CAUSED HEAD INJURIES. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A REAR LIFT GLASS PANEL DETACHES FROM AN EXPLORER IN MOTION ON A HIGHWAY. THAT COULD EASILY LEAD TO A MULTI  VEHICLE ACCIDENT ALONG WITH MULTIPLE FATALITIES.      I CHECKED AND FORD HAD A SIMILAR PART RECALL FOR 2002 & 2003 EXPLORERS. FORD CHANGED THE PART THEN AND HAS NOT MET THE # OF COMPLAINTS TO BE FORCED TO RECALL 2004 AND UP EXPLORERS. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK MANY EXPLORER OWNERS CHECK WITH THE DEALER AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS/IS A RECALL AND GIVE UP UPON HEARING NO. WE NEED TO GET ANYONE WE KNOW WITH THIS PROBLEM TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA.       IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOME INNOCENT PERSON DIES AS A RESULT OF THIS \"KNOWN\" DEFECT!

I PUT THE FORD EXPLORER IN REVERSE AND WAS GOING BACKWARDS TO PARK IN THE STALL.  WHEN I MOVED THE SHIFT GEAR HANDLE TO PUT THE TRUCK INTO DRIVE INTO THE PARKING STALL, THE GEAR SHIFT WAS JUST BROKE OFF.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!

I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO BANNING, CALIFORNIA AND HAVE MY MECHANIC FIX IT.  STILL TO THIS DAY, FORD CANNOT PROVIDE A PART TO FIX THE STEERING COLUMN SHIFT LEVEL.  FORD SAYS ITS ON BACKORDER, NO ONE HAS THE PART.  THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN I WILL HAVE THE PART TO FIX MY TRUCK.

ONLY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COULD BE DIAGNOSED BECAUSE  THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AT RANDOM WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER THE 1000 MILE WARRANTY SO THE EGR VALVE WAS REPLACED AND A SPEED SENSOR BELIEVED TO BE THE PROBLEM WITH THE ABS LIGHT.

THIS HAPPENED IN JULY, JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER BUYING THE CAR.    EARLIER THIS MONTH (NOVEMBER 2012) THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN BUT IT DIDN'T STAY ON SO I COULDN'T GET IT DIAGNOSED.  NO NEED TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED BECAUSE THE BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON TOO.  I TOOK IT TO AUTOZONE ONCE AGAIN AND THE BATTERY TESTED BAD.  IT WOULDN'T START AT THE STORE.

WE HAD TO STAND THERE IN 80+ DEGREE HEAT HOLDING THE ENTIRE WINDOW (WHICH IS QUITE HEAVY), WHILE MY 2 YEAR OLD BAKED IN THE CAR, UNTIL MY DAD & BROTHER COULD GET TO THE STORE WE WERE AT TO RESCUE US. WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT TO SHUT (THOUGH WE WERE TERRIFIED THE GLASS WAS GOING TO SHATTER AT ANY MOMENT DUE TO THE TENSION ON IT) & WE DUCT TAPED IT TO KEEP IT IN PLACE. WE HAD THE HINGE REPAIRED BY OUR LOCAL BODY SHOP, & HAD THEM REPLACE BOTH HINGES TO BE PROACTIVE. IT COST ABOUT $200. AFTER THIS HAPPENED I DID SOME INTERNET SEARCHES & WAS UPSET TO FIND SO MANY OTHER 2004 FORD EXPLORER OWNERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM & I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT FORD HAS RECALLED THE SAME HINGES ON 2002 & 2003 MODELS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE 2004 EXPLORER HAS NOT HAD THE SAME RECALL WHEN THEY'RE THE SAME HINGES?  THIS SEEMS LIKE SUCH A BLATANT DISREGARD BY FORD.  PEOPLE COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED BY THIS WINDOW EITHER FALLING ON THEIR HEAD, OR FALLING OFF WHILE DRIVING.  THE 2003 FORD EXPLORER RECALL WAS EXPLAINED AS THIS:  ON CERTAIN SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES, THE LIFTGATE GLASS STRUT MAY BECOME DISENGAGED OR THE HINGE MAY FRACTURE ALLOWING THE GLASS TO FALL AND POSSIBLY BREAK.  THE EXACT SAME THING COULD BE SAID OF 2004 FORD EXPLORERS. I AM WRITING THIS IN THE HOPES THAT A RECALL CAN BE MADE ON THIS EQUIPMENT. IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT. THANK GOODNESS MY 11 YR OLD WASN'T THE ONE UNDER THIS WINDOW WHEN IT BROKE!!  I DID EMAIL FORD REGARDING THIS ISSUE & THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY HELPFUL. THEY BASICALLY SAID, SORRY & THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THE 04 AT THIS TIME & THAT THEY WORK WITH NHTSA TO STAY ON TOP OF AREAS OF CONCERN.  *TR",

THERE WAS ALSO A RECALL ON THE HATCH WINDOW IN 2003 FOR THE FORD EXPLORER TRUCK. IN 2007, I HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS THE 2003 RECALL ON MY 2004 VEHICLE BUT WAS TOLD I HAD TO PAY TO GET IT FIXED MYSELF BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A RECALL REPORTED FOR 2004. ALTHOUGH IT WAS A YEAR LATER. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ISSUE WASN'T RESOLVED BECAUSE I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THERE IS ALSO A BREAK LIGHT SWITCH PROBLEM. THIS ISSUE HAS YOUR BREAK LIGHTS RANDOMLY COMING ON ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF. WHICH DRAINS THE BATTERY AND CAUSES YOU TO HAVE TO GET THE BRAKE SWITCH FIXED AND A NEW BATTERY.

SERVICE DEALER GAVE THREE OPTIONS, ONE WAS FOR AROUND $3000 THEY WOULD REPLACE TIMING CHAINS, GUIDES, AND TENSIONER, BUT WITH NO GUARANTEE AS THE TIMING CHAIN PROBLEM COULD HAVE CAUSED OTHER DAMAGE. THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS WERE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.    THIS 2004 FORD EXPLORER WE HAD BOUGHT BRAND NEW, AND ONLY HAD SOMEWHERE AROUND 65K MILES. IF YOU WERE TO GOGGLE SOME KEY WORDS LIKE ( FORD 2004 V6 TIMING CHAIN GUIDE TENSIONER) YOU WILL FIND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM CAUSED BY A BAD DESIGN WITH THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER WHICH LOOSES PRESSURE AND ALLOW THE TIMING CHAIN S TO JUMP TEETH.    MY WIFE CALLED FORD HEADQUARTERS TODAY, AND THEY TREATED IT LIKE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EVER HEARD OF THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ASSURED HER THAT THEY NO LONGER MAKE THAT STYLE OF ENGINE.    FORD KNOWS VERY WELL ABOUT THIS BAD TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER DESIGN, AND BASICALLY WHEN THAT HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY WE COULD HAVE EASILY GOT INTO A BAD ACCIDENT.    THIS STYLE OF ENGINE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED AT FORD'S EXPENSE, I AM DISAPPOINTED AS WE TREATED THIS EXPLORER WITH TLC, AND NOW WE ARE TOLD THE ENGINE IS JUNK.  *TR",

BECAUSE IT WON'T GO  WHEN IT DOES CATCH UP THERE IS A HARD BUMP IN THE CAR AND LOUD SOUND..VERY AGGRAVATING AND SCARY.  HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD ITS A (SP) SOLENOID PROBLEM AND HAD BEEN FIXED, BUT IT HASN'T  HAVE BEEN DISGUSTED AND BEEN DRIVING IT THIS WAY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE $2000 FOR REPAIRS. *TR",

DURING THOSE CALLS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, I REQUESTED A FORD FACTORY REP CONTACT ME BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE REFUSED AND ADVISED ME AGAIN TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE.  LAST WEEK, MY TRANSMISSION FINALLY FAILED AT 87K MILES. IT STILL SHIFTED HARD, AND HAD DELAYED SHIFTS, BUT IT SUDDENLY HAD NO REVERSE, AND EXTREME SLIPPAGE IN FIRST GEAR. THE CHECK TRANSMISSION LIGHT STARTED FLASHING FOR THE FIRST TIME SO IT STORED A CODE. I TOOK MY EXPLORER BACK TO THE DEALER WHO ADVISED THE CODE MEANT AN INTERNAL FAILURE OF A BAND OR OTHER PART AND THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF ABOUT $4500.  THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER WAS VERY GOOD ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROBLEM, SO I AM STILL NOT AT ALL UPSET WITH THE LOCAL DEALER.  I PAID ALMOST $200 FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC OF A FAILED BAND BUT DECIDED TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED AT A LOCAL TRANSMISSION SHOP. THERE, THE MANAGER TOOK THE TRANSMISSION APART TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND DID NOT FIND A BROKEN BAND OR OTHER PART. HE ADVISED IT WAS PROBABLY DUE TO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE IT WAS NEW, AND ADVISED THAT I INSTALL A REBUILT TRANSMISSION INSTEAD OF REBUILDING THIS ONE DUE TO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE ALUMINUM CASE.

TODAY(9 MAR 09) I TOOK IT IN FOR THIS PROBLEM & WAS TOLD THAT MY SHIFT SOLENOID ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. WHAT!?!?!-NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T JUST HAVE $1,100 TO SHELL OUT FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM(WELL @ LEAST I DON'T). I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD MY VEHICLE @ THE DEALERS REPAIR SHOP AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM. TODAY (9 MAR 09) I WAS TOLD THAT THIS SHIFT SOLENOID ASSEMBLY COULD ALSO BE THE CULPRIT OF THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT MY VEHICLE HAS-WHICH IS:WHEN BRAKING MY VEHICLE ENGINE WILL SHUTTER, BUCK & DIE. LOSING ALL ENGINE& ELECTRICAL POWER. IF I PLACE THE VEHICLE BACK IN PARK & RESTART PROBLEM WILL NORMALLY BE GONE. BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS. MY VEHICLE NOW HAS  77,810 MILES. SINCE THE LATEST OCCURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING IT TO FIND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN THIS FAMILY OF VEHICLES ONLY BE DISTURBED THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THE SITUATION. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS FAMILY OF MOTOR VEHICLES IS SUBPAR. THIS CO & IT'S OEM TRANSMISSION IS ANYTHING BUT RELIABLE. WHAT HAPPENED TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AGAINST UNREASONABLE RISKS & ACCIDENTS. CONTINUED OPERATION OF THIS FAMILY OF VEHICLES WITHOUT A RECALL WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM POSSIBLY EVEN INJURY TO A AN INNOCENT PERSON. PLEASE INITIATE AN RECALL FOR THIS PRODUCT OR LEAST START AN INVESTIGATION INTO THESE PROBLEMS IF IT HASN'T BEEN STARTED AS OF YET. *TR",

THERE IS AN 18-WHEELER ON MY REAR AND I CAN'T PICK UP SPEED!  LUCKILY, I WAS APPROACHING AN EXIT AND MANAGED TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF OF THE INTERSTATE AND ONTO A LESS TRAVELED ROAD.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT I HAVE ENDURED THIS SCENARIO.  ONCE AGAIN THE SOLENOID IS GONE, WITH REPAIRS ESTIMATED AT $1255.00. I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM REPAIRED LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER PURCHASE.  I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM REPAIRED AT 32,567 MILES, AND I NOW HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN AT 76,725 MILES.  I HAVE HAD THE CLUTCH PACK REPLACED AT 24,940 MILES AS WELL AS THE RING GEAR, PINION, AND ALL BEARINGS REPLACED AT 24,940 MILES.  AT 35,558 MILES THE LOWER BALL JOINT HAD TO BE REPLACED. AT 64,335 I HAD TO HAVE THE PATS TRANSPONDER(SECURITY SYSTEM) REPLACED.  IN SHORT I HAVE HAD THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED THREE TIMES THE FRONT END REBUILT , THE BACK END REDONE. I HONESTLY CAN SAY I DO NOT FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE TO USE THIS TO TRANSPORT MY CHILDREN.  THESE PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE THE NORM FOR THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE, AS I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY FORD IS NOT MADE TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES.

WE HAD TO SELL THINGS, BORROW MONEY WITH INTEREST AND WITH MY HUSBAND SO VERY ILL THAT HIS MEDICINE FOR 7 PILLS EVERY THREE MONTHS IS OVER $700 A 3 MONTH. SOMEONE HAD TO MAKE A MISTAKE. I HAVE DRIVEN FORDS SINCE I STARTED DRIVE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AGO. MATTER OF FACT THE FIRST CAR I DROVE WAS THE FORD PUSH BUTTON. PLEASE FIND OUT IF THERE IS SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP US WITH THIS EXTREMELY HIGH REPAIR BILL. THIS CAR IS OUR ONLY TRANSPORTATION AND  IS VERY WRONG FOR US TO HAVE TO PAY THIS MUCH FOR REPAIR FOR SUCH A NEW CAR. THANK YOU , NORMA GROTBERG  *TR",

THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CRUISE CONTROL STOP WORKING. TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT AT. THEY TRIED TO RESET THE COMPUTER. ADVISED ME I WOULD NEED A NEW ACS MODULE FOR THE ABS. I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO TRY AND GET THE MODULE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. THE BEST FORD WOULD DO IS TO SPLIT THE COST OF THE MODULE WITH ME, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR LABOR TO INSTALL. WHEN ASKED HOW MUCH THE MODULE COST. WAS TOLD 1160.00. THIS WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY WOULD TRY TO FIND A USED MODULE. I CALLED BACK AFTER SEVERAL DAYS AND WAS INFORMED THEY COULD NOT FIND ONE. THE NEXT DAY I GOT ON THE PHONE AND WITHIN 20 MINS HAD FOUND A MODULE AT A LOCAL SALVAGE YARD. ASKED THE DEALERSHIP IF THEY WOULD PURCHASE THE USED MODULE WITH THE MONEY FORD WAS GOING TO PROVIDE WITH THE NEW MODULE TO FIX IT. THEY SAID NO. FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS AWARE THAT MANY OF THE 2004 EXPLORERS HAVE ABS AND POWERTRAIN ISSUES, YET THEY FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE.  NOW I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE IN MY BRAKING. SOMETIMES NOW WHEN I HAVE TO USE THE BRAKES, I CAN FEEL SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. I AM WORRIED THAT WHEN I WILL NEED THE ABS TO WORK I WILL NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL HAS STOPPED WORKING AS WELL WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MILEAGE. THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO TELL ME IF THE CRUISE CONTROL IS RELATED TO THE ABS MODULE. THEY NEVER CHECK THE CRUISE CONTROL PROBLEM AND WAS NOT AWARE OF IT TILL I HAD CALLED THEM BACK ON THE USED ABS MODULE. FORD NEEDS TO STEP UP AND TAKE CARE OF THESE MAJOR ISSUES WITH THESE EXPLORERS....POOR PARTS INSTALLED AT TIME OF MANUFACTURING.  FORD SHOULD BE LIABLE.  *TR",

I TOOK THE EXPLORER BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPAIRED THE SAME PART AGAIN. THE PROBLEM CONTINUED AND PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE SO I WAS FORCED TO TAKE IT BACK AGAIN IN DECEMBER OF 2006 TO THE DEALER.

WELL IT SEEMS TO ME IF IT WAS REPAIRED CORRECTLY THE FIRST OR SECOND TIME THEN IT WOULDN'T BE HAPPENING JUST ABOUT EVERY YEAR. I WOULD DRIVE MY TRUCK LOCALLY AND IT NORMALLY WOULD NOT WANT TO MOVE. ONE DAY ON MY LUNCH HOUR, I TRIED TO CROSS A MAJOR 4 LANE HIGHWAY AND THIS 2004 FORD EXPLORER, LEFT ME STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LUNCH RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, TO BE T-BONED BY ON COMING TRAFFIC. TALK ABOUT, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS; I WAS SO UPSET THAT I HAD TO GO HOME FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.  IT IS JUST AS SCARY TO THINK MY TRUCK WOULD BREAK DOWN DUE TO MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS WITH MY KIDS IN THE TRUCK. THIS HAPPENED SO OFTEN AND MOST TIMES AT NIGHT.

UPON RECEIVING MY CAR BACK ON 8/16/05 THE AC WAS FIXED AND MY RECEIPT STATED THE AC WAS FIXED BUT IT ALSO MENTIONED SOMETHING REGARDING A RECALL IN MY TRANSMISSION. THE RECEIPT SAID THERE WAS AN OIL ADDITIVE PLACED IN MY TRANSMISSION. 1 YEAR AND 1 MONTH LATER MY TRANSMISSION HAS BEGUN SLIPPING AND HESITATING. WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR BACK TO WORLD FORD OF KENDALL IN MIAMI, FL TO SPEAK TO THEM REGARDING MY TRANSMISSION I WAS TOLD THAT THEIR SERVICE WORK IS GUARANTEED UP TO 12 MONTHS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR ME. UPON DOING MY OWN RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THE OIL ADDITIVE THAT WAS PLACED IN MY FORD WAS TO PREVENT THE SLIPPING AND HESITATION OF MY TRANSMISSION. I CALLED THE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS OF FORD AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR ME. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT FORD KNEW ABOUT MY TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS OR A RECALL SERVICE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DONE. THEY NOW WANT TO CHARGE ME TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION ON A CAR THAT WAS BROKEN WHEN IT LEFT THE MANUFACTURING PLANT. MY CAR HAS 45,000 MILES AND NO WHERE IN MY PAPERWORK OR MY CAR MANUAL DOES IT STATE I WOULD HAVE TO PUT AND OIL ADDITIVE IN MY CAR BY 45,000 MILES. WHEN I SPOKE TO FORD CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS THEY TOLD ME IF THE OIL ADDITIVE DOES NOT WORK ANOTHER PROCEDURE WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE BUT IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE ESPECIALLY FROM A LARGE CORPORATION SUCH AS FORD. MY FAMILY DRIVES THIS CAR AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN UNSAFE CAR RESULTING FROM A RECALL IN MY TRANSMISSION. I ADDITION TO THE TRANSMISSION RECALL, THE AC IN MY CAR HAS ALSO BROKEN TWICE AND NOBODY WANTS TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THERE ARE SO MY PROBLEMS WITH A 2 YEAR OLD CAR.

FORD SENT A LETTER, JANUARY 2005, STATING THAT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID USED AT THE ASSEMBLY PLANT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE, THAT OVER TIME, IT COULD CAUSE DELAYED/HARSH ENGAGEMENTS.  WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR THE FLUID REPLACEMENT (42K MILES APPROX), I MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM TO THE SERVICE EMPLOYEE.  HE SAID THAT THIS WOULD PROBABLY FIX THE PROBLEM, AND THAT I SHOULD DRIVE IT FOR AWHILE TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM CORRECTS ITSELF.    AT 49K MILES, I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTER DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE FIRST PHONE CALL I RECEIVED, THE SERVICE CENTER EMPLOYEE SAID THAT HE DROVE THE CAR ON TWO OCCASIONS AND THE PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR.  THEN, I EXPLAINED THE SYMPTOMS DIRECTLY TO THE MECHANIC.  THE NEXT DAY, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT THE VALVE BODY ON THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1050.  THEN, TWO DAYS LATER, AFTER REMOVING THE CASING TO REPLACE THE VALVE BODY, THEY SAID THAT THEY FOUND DEPOSITS OF METAL IN THE VALVE BODY.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE FURTHER DISASSEMBLY TO DETERMINE PARTS AND SERVICE REQUIRED.  THE PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL $400 PLUS PARTS.  I AM AMAZED THAT A NEW VEHICLE WOULD HAVE A SERIOUS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM LIKE THIS, AND FORD IS ACCEPTING NO RESPONSIBILITY.

AT FIRST IT WAS JUST INTO REVERSE, THEN IT WAS FROM REVERSE INTO FORWARD DRIVE GEARS, THEN IT WOULD SLAM EVERY TIME IT CHANGED GEARS.  WHEN I TOOK IT IN, FORD REPLACED THE VALVE BODY FOR THE TRANSMISSION, THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL, AND A SOLENOID.  SEEMED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 10K MILES.  THEN THE REVERSE SLAMMING STARTED AGAIN AND SOME SLIGHT SLAMMING WHEN GOING FROM REVERSE TO THE FORWARD GEAR.  SO I TOOK IT BACK AND ALSO ASKED THEM TO DO SOME ROUTINE MAINTANENCE INSPECTIONS, DURING WHICH TIME THEY INFORMED ME MY REAR LEFT WHEEL BEARING WAS BAD AND THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DRIVEABLE.  AT THIS TIME THEY ALSO TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  NOW, 10K MILES LATER, IT'S BACK IN THE SHOP WITH SLAMMING GEARS AND WHINING NOISES COMING FROM WHEEL AREA.  THE SLAMMING TRANSMISSION IS BASICALLY SHAKING MY VEHICLE APART BIT BY BIT.  MY FEAR OF COURSE IS THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.  I'M HOPING I CAN GET RESOLUTION BEFORE A PART ACTUALLY FALLS OFF WHILE I'M GOING 70 DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  I'VE BEEN READING NEWS RELEASES AND OWNER FORUMS AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A RATHER COMMON ISSUE, THOUGH LUCKILY NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT AS OF YET.",

IN ADDITION, WHEN I HOLD THE TOP OF THE BACK SEAT I CAN TILT IT FORWARD AND BACKWARD AND IT HAS ABOUT 6\" OF PLAY. I BROUGHT THE PROBLEM TO THE ATTENTION OF FORD MOTOR CO. AND THEY SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL AND THEY WILL NOT REPAIR IT UNLESS I PAY FOR IT. THE FORD CO. SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY A BROKEN TRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAT.

THE VEHICLE ALSO DOES THIS WHEN PUTTING INTO DRIVE, AND WHEN DRIVING WILL NOT GO INTO GEAR UNLESS YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF OF THE GAS PEDAL AND THEN RE-APPLY THE GAS.  WE LEASED THIS CAR BRAND NEW LATE JULY 2004 AND HAVE JUST REACHED THE 4 MONTH MARK YESTERDAY.  THE DEALERSHIP DENIED ANY SERVICE PROBLEMS OR RECALLS FOR THIS BUT ON YOUR WEBSITE I FOUND AT LEAST 2 SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  THE DEALERSHIPS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RENTAL CAR WHICH I FIND ABSURD!  THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR AND OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS.  WE HAVE ONE VEHICLE AND HAVE TO CAR POOL THROUGHOUT THE DAY FOR THE BOTH OF US TO BE ABLE TO WORK OUR JOBS.  THE DEALERSHIPS INDICATED THAT THE CAR WOULD HAVE TO SIT FOR AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN LOOK AT IT!

I WAS TAKEN TO AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, C-SPINE/BACKBOARD, NECK AND BACK SPASMS, LOTS OF PAIN, TINGLING BILATERAL ARMS AND LEGS, ETC.  NOW UNABLE TO WORK, UNKNOWN TIME DUE TO NECK AND BACK INJURY.  I AM AN ER NURSE.  IF MY SEAT BELT HAD HELD ME, I WOULD PROBABLY BE AT WORK RIGHT NOW AND NOT WRITING THIS COMPLAINT. YOUR QUESTION OF NUMBER OF FAILURES: THE BELT CATCHES ABOUT 1 IN 30 OR MORE ATTEMPT TO GET IT TO HOLD/CATCH.  I AM AWAITING A SCHEDULED MRI OF MY SPINE, AND WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST.
