This is a known safety problem and there have been many lawsuits regarding this issue. I have contacted Ford Corporate and they are only recommending to replace the long block instead of replacing the entire engine. There is potential to have damage to the cylinder heads, piston rods and other crucial parts in the engine which make me feel very unsafe about its future reliability when \"only replacing the long block\" which really seems like putting a band aid on the problem. They are not willing to spend the time or money to ensure that the vehicle is safe and the problem is properly diagnosed and resolved. This is alarming as it seems they are trying to cut corners in order to save money. Many people have had this problem and I heard from my private mechanic that they do so many 2.0l ecoboost a week at the dealership because of this exact same problem. I think the NTHSA should look into an engine recall.   I also have had an open recall on the front brake lines needing to be replaced due to possible failure for over 1 year and Ford has dragged their feet.
