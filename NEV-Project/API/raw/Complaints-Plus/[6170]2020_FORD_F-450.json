The tire \"blew out\" while pulling a horse trailer with 7 horses on board.   I personally checked tire pressure before departure.  Our driver  was able to get to safety without harm.  Had the blow out occurred on a front tire, the results could have been catastrophic.   Road side assistance told us he has had 3 other tires, same truck, same tire, same age, blow out in the last 7 days.  I know from your site and consumer reports, Continental has a huge recall campaign for blow outs.  ALSO there is \"0\" inventory of this tire for us to replace our bad tire, due to high failure rates. I have called Continental about this.  They deny any problem nor responsibility. 0 contrition  Contact there is manager \"Rod\" at 618-242-7398.",

        "summary": "Unknown.  So, on May 30th, 2021 my passenger side main battery blew up for no reason. I took it to Autozone and we checked the system and everything seem fine and had the correct voltage. On July 3, 2021 my truck started smoking. I pulled over, put the truck in park and shut off the truck. I looked around trying to locate the cause of the smoke but couldn\u2019t. I opened all the doors to air out the truck. Everything seemed to be fine at the time so I got back in and started driving. I got about 200 yards and then smoke started to come heavily out of the vents on the left and right side of the stereo. I pulled over again in a safe area away from cars and building, put the the truck in park and shut off the truck. I looked in the vents where the smoke was coming from and noticed flames. I grabbed my keys, ran to my trailer, grabbed a 7 gallon jug of water, ran back, called 911 and proceeded to try and put the fire out. While talking to 911 they asked where I was and address. I didn\u2019t know but they kept insisting. I stopped located a number on a building and told them. Turned around after 30 seconds or so and the entire dash was engulfed in flames. I grabbed my computer, Xbox, and dogs. One dog got scared and ran into the trailer it took me about a min to get her out. I looked back at the truck and the whole truck at that time was engulfed in flames",

Found a steady drip of fuel only while running from fuel filter under hood above valve cover, replaced filter and leak stopped. Closer look found heavy stains from fuel leak on top of engine. Has been that way since new. Leak now fixed. This could be a fire hazard.  Glad I found it.",
