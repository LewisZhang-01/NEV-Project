THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS IN SEPTEMBER OF 2017 RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE AS WELL AS THE REAR END. I WAS LIVING ON BLOCK ISLAND AND THE CAR LET LOOSE OUT OF THE PARKING SPOT AND ROLLED BACKWARDS INTO A TREE DOING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE AND COMPLETELY TAKING THE MIRROR OFF. AFTER HITTING THE TREE THE CAR THE REDIRECTED TOWARDS ANOTHER GROUP OF SMALL TRESS CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE DRIVERS SIDE WHERE IT THEN STOPPED IN A STONE WALL DAMAGING THE REAR BUMPER. AFTER A BATTLE WITH BOTH MAZDA AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY I WAS LEFT REPAIRING THE CAR MYSELF.     ON OCTOBER 10TH OF THIS YEAR I WENT OUTSIDE TO START MY CAR TO FIND IT HAD YET AGAIN RELEASED ITSELF AND WAS IN A DITCH AT THE END OF MY DRIVEWAY. CAUSING DAMAGE TO BOTH SIDES OF THE VEHICLE, THE REAR LIGHTS AND BUMPER COVER. THIS TIME THE CAR WENT DOWN INTO A DITCH SO THERE IS ALSO DAMAGE TO THE UNDERCARRIAGE AS WELL. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MAZDA AND THEY CLAIM THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  LUCKILY IN BOTH INCIDENTS THE CAR WAS IN RURAL AREA SO IT DIDN'T INJURE ANYONE AND IT ONLY TOOK OUT VEGETATION AND A STONE WALL.    I PAY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT MONTHLY TO LEASE THIS CAR AND I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT, I FEAR WHAT WILL BE BEHIND IT NEXT TIME THE E-BRAKE LETS LOOSE. I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BRING A WHEEL CHOCK WITH ME WHENEVER I GO INTO THE CITY SINCE THE INCIDENT IN 2017.  DUE TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY DELAYING ANY PROGRESS ON FIXING THE CAR I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RENT A CAR PAYING OUT OF POCKET THE EXPENSE SO THAT I AM SAFE ON THE ROADS.

I WAS DRIVING 75 MPH, THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT FOR THAT STRETCH OF TEXAS HIGHWAY. THE SURFACE OF THE ROAD IS BRAND NEW AND DRIVING CONDITIONS WERE IDEAL.     AT APPROXIMATELY 6:10 PM, ABOUT 10 MILES FROM HOME, THERE WAS A LOUD THUD AND MY CAR DROPPED AND LURCHED TOWARD THE CENTER LINE. I THOUGHT I HAD HIT SOMETHING HUGE, AND EXPECTED TO FIND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND A SHREDDED TIRE. I MANAGED TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER CONTROL AND AVOID BEING HIT, AND WITH A SOUND OF GRATING METAL, MOVED OVER TO THE SHOULDER.     TO MY SURPRISE, THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY DAMAGE TO THE CAR. NO OTHER VEHICLES HAD TO SWERVE AROUND ANYTHING IN THE ROAD. THERE WAS NO DEBRIS IN THE ROAD. I CALLED A WRECKER SERVICE TO CHANGE THE TIRE. HE DISCOVERED THAT THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE WHEEL WAS SPLIT IN HALF, AND SAID THE WHEEL NEEDED TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.    MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE FOLKS SOUNDED SYMPATHETIC BUT TOOK OVER A WEEK AND SEVERAL CALLS TO TOW THE CAR TO A MAZDA DEALER. THEY INSPECTED THE CAR AND DETERMINED THAT I HAD HIT SOMETHING, THUS THEY WOULD NOT COVER ANY OF THE COST. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ROCK, WOOD, OR ANIMAL IN THE TREAD - I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT THE RIM SIMPLY BROKE WHILE I WAS DRIVING. NO METALLURGIST LOOKED AT THE SPLIT RIM, AND THE OTHER THREE RIMS WERE ONLY VISUALLY INSPECTED.    I PAID $601 FOR A NEW WHEEL AND TIRE BUT AM CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY METAL WHEEL RIMS BREAKING. I HAVE PHOTOS AND THE BROKEN WHEEL RIM AND TIRE.",

AS SHE APPROACHED THE EXIT RAMP ON A HIGHWAY NEAR OUR HOUSE SHE FELT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS ANOTHER CAR HITTING HER IN THE REAR. SINCE NO VEHICLES STOPPED SHE DROVE THE CAR TO A CORNER NEAR OUR HOUSE WHILE HEARING A LOUD GRINDING SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.    WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT THE DRIVER SIDE REAR BRAKE UNIT WAS MISSING 1 OF THE 2 BOLTS THAT HELD IT IN PLACE AND THE SECOND BOLT HAD DISLODGED TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO HOLD THE BRAKE UNIT IN PLACE. LUCKILY THE UNIT DID NOT COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BODY WHEN IT WAS DISLODGED AT 55 MILES PER HOUR AND MY DAUGHTER DID NOT LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THIS WAS A BRAND-NEW CAR THAT WAS DELIVERED TO OUR DEALER FROM ANOTHER DEALER AND PREPARED FOR US BY OUR DEALER, HUNTINGTON MAZDA.    WE ASKED THEM TO ENGAGE MAZDA TO FIND OUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT APPEARS THAT NO INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE AND THE VEHICLE WAS FIXED AND RETURNED TO US AFTER ABOUT 3 OR 4 WEEKS DUE TO PARTS AVAILABILITY. I HAVE A GREAT CONCERN THAT THIS ISSUE MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO OUR VEHICLE AND THAT SOMEONE COULD BE IN DANGER. THE QA MARKINGS APPEAR WHERE THE BOLTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN, SO THIS DEFECT OCCURRED EITHER AT THE DEALER OR A RESULT OF NORMAL OPERATION DISLODGING THE BOLTS.    THE ATTACHED IMAGES SHOW THE BRAKES FROM THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. I ALSO CREATED A SECOND COPY OF EACH OF THE PICTURE WITH THE AREA IF INTEREST HIGHLIGHTED.",
