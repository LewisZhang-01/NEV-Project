The car was inspected by my insurance company AARP Hartford and denied payment. They considered this a mechanical issue. The suv was towed to Honda North in Butler PA where we bought the vehicle new for inspection. They also said it was a rust issue one of which the service manager has never seen in 30 some years working at Honda. He referred it to the area manager who said the same. They too would not repair or offer compensation monies. I found there is a recall in Canada for the same problem. The vehicle has always been garage kept in a heated area. There is no rust on the rest of the body. I was lucky that we were only going about 10MPH when this incident happened in Franklin PA. Two days prior we were driving on 79 South heading to Pittsburgh PA and going 65/70 MPH. Thank God it did not happen then. We do not have any repair estimates from the Honda North people, they simply said it was not something they would repair. I am still waiting for documentation from our Hartford Insurance claim.",

IT APPEARS THAT HONDA CONTINUED TO USE THE DEFECTIVE ACTUATOR SINCE 2008, YET CUSTOMERS ARE BEING TOLD THAT A \"FIX\" IS IN THE WORKS, 7 YEARS LATER. AMERICAN HONDA HAS ADVISED HONDA SERVICE DEPARTMENTS TO NOT REPLACE THE ACTUATOR AS IT IS LIKELY THAT THE REPLACEMENT ACTUATOR WILL PRESENT THE SAME GRINDING NOISE.

SUDDENLY THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION OF THE CAR WITH NO ABILITY TO BRAKE THE VEHICLE, WHICH DID NOT STOP UNTIL IT HIT A BRICK WALL THAT WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CAR, PERHAPS JUST 8-10 FEET AWAY.  WHEN THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO BRAKE DID NOT WORK, I HIT THE BRAKE A SECOND TIME.  STILL NOTHING.      AFTER I HIT THE WALL, A CONTRACTION WORKER WHO SAW THE ENTIRE THING CAME OVER TO CHECK ON ME. (I DID HAVE A SEATBELT ON, AND THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.) I FELT LIKE I WAS OKAY, BUT WAS SHOOK UP AND CONFUSED. I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE STATED THAT HE COULD SMELL THE BRAKES, WHICH WERE SO HOT FROM TRYING TO STOP THE CAR.       SUBSTANTIAL FRONT END DAMAGE WAS INCURRED, AND THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A BODY SHOP.  ASSESSMENT THERE SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE ITSELF AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF BRAKE FLUID IN THE RESERVOIR. I BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER INCIDENT, LIKE OTHERS HAVE REPORTED, WHERE THE CAR ACCELERATES AS THE BRAKES ARE TAPPED.  I CONSIDER THIS CAR TO BE DANGEROUS AT THIS POINT, AND I AM WAITING FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO DETERMINE IF THEY WILL TOTAL IT.

I CALLED BACK, AND WAS TOLD THAT TO GET A LOANER I MUST DRIVE THE UNSAFE CAR TO THEM TO HAVE THE MILEAGE VERIFIED, THEN, SIGN A WAIVER RELEASING HONDA FROM LIABILITY IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN I DROVE THAT UNSAFE CAR HOME. IF THE VEHICLE IS SO UNSAFE TO DRIVE THAT I MUST SIGN A WAIVER TO TAKE IT HOME, THEN WHY DO THEY REQUIRE ME TO DRIVE IT THERE SO THAT THEY CAN SEE HOW MANY MILES ARE ON IT?

MEANWHILE ANOTHER LETTER ARRIVES LAST WEEK SAYING THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG IS ALSO RECALLED IN ADDITION TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE. WHY A COMPANY SUCH AS HONDA WOULD HAVE HID THIS KNOWLEDGE FROM THE VERY FIRST RECALL IS APPALLING, MY DAUGHTER IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RENTAL CAR THEY ARE OFFERING BECAUSE SHE IS NOT YET 21. AGAIN, SHE LEAVES IN 8 DAYS FOR HER FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE.  INITIALLY, I USED THE HONDA WEBSITE TO ENTER THE CARS INFORMATION AND VERY THE RECALL. I PROVIDED A PLACE TO CLICK AND CHOOSE A DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE PARTS. ONLY PROBLEM IS THE EVEN THOUGH IT LET YOU CHOOSE A DEALERSHIP, IT DID NOT SHARE WITH THE DEALERSHIP THE CARS INFO SO THAT THE PARTS COULD BE ORDERED. I SUPPOSE THIS SHOULD NOT MATTER SINCE THE COMPANY CAN NOT REPAIR THE AIRBAGS AND LEAVES MY DAUGHTERS LIFE IN DANGER. ET, THEIR HONDA WEBSITE WAS NOT AS EFFICIENT AS THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO SEEM.",

AN ADULT IS NOT ABLE TO SIT IN-BETWEEN THE CAR SEATS IN THE BACK.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE PARTS WERE STILL NOT AVAILABLE AND THAT THE WAIT LIST FOR BOTH AIRBAGS IS MONTHS LONG.  I REQUESTED A RENTAL CAR AND THE NEXT DAY, MIRACULOUSLY THERE IS A PART FOR THE FRONT AIR BAG.  THEY TOLD US WE COULD NO LONGER RECEIVE A RENTAL FOR JUST THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.  I GUESS THE PASSENGER'S LIFE IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE DRIVER?  WHEN I PUT MY VIN IN THE RECALL WEBSITE, EVEN TODAY IT SAYS \"REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE.\"  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE PART THAT THEY PUT IS IN REALLY INTENDED FOR A 2010 HONDA CRV AND NOT FOR ANOTHER CAR JUST SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL.  WHY WERE WE NOT TOLD YESTERDAY WHEN WE CALLED TO CONFIRM INFORMATION ABOUT THE RENTAL THAT THE PART WAS IN?  OUR APPOINTMENT WAS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, SO IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE (AFTER BEING TOLD ABOUT THE LONG WAIT LIST AND THE PARTS WERE NOT IN JUST THE OTHER DAY) THAT THE PART WE NEEDED CAME IN RIGHT BEFORE WE PICKED UP THE RENTAL?

THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL EXCEPT MY RIGHT FOOT WHICH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED; HOWEVER, THE CAR KEPT ACCELERATING  WITH NOTHING ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. I USED THE FULL FORCE OF MY  BODY TO APPLY BRAKE PRESSURE, BUT THIS WOULD NOT STOP THE CAR; IT MERELY SLOWED IT DOWN SOMEWHAT BUT THE CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING. I HAD TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THIS CONSTANT FULL BODY FORCE EXERTION ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS THE CAR KEPT ACCELERATING.  AFTER ABOUT 45 SECONDS I IMMEDIATELY THREW THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL WHEREUPON THE RPMS  SURGED WAY PAST 7000 (ONCE AGAIN THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND NOTHING WAS TOUCHING IT) & PAST THE CORRESPONDING RED LINE ON THE TACHOMETER. AFTER APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER 15 SECONDS I THREW IT BACK INTO DRIVE WITH THE FULL FORCE OF MY BODY STILL ON THE BREAK PEDAL AND NO PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND I MANAGED TO MANEUVER AND  TURN HARD THE VEHICLE INTO A VACANT DRIVEWAY WHEREUPON I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE. THEREAFTER, THE ENGINE AREA SMOKED FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. I WAITED APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AND CAREFULLY STARTED THE CAR AGAIN, BACKED OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY AND DROVE SLOWLY DOWN THE NEARBY ROAD TO SEE IF IT WAS GOING TO OCCUR AGAIN. IT DID NOT. I DROVE A THE CAR HOME A FEW MILES AWAY, DID NOT USE IT AGAIN THAT DAY AND THE VERY NEXT DAY (JUNE 10, 2016) I WENT TO THE HONDA DEALER.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY FAULT CODES OR ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG. THEY CLAIMED THE ACCELERATOR WAS OKAY, THERE WERE NO CODES IN THE SYSTEM AND THE BRAKE OVER RIDE WAS WORKING (WHICH IT WAS NOT AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED  BECAUSE I HAD TO PUT THE FULL FORCE OF MY BODY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL  TO MERELY EVEN SLOW IT DOWN SOMEWHAT BUT THE CAR WAS STILL MOVING UNCONTROLLABLY) AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.",

THIS WAS BEFORE MY FIRST OIL CHANGE. I CONTINUED TO ADD OIL AS THE SOUND RE-OCCURRED, 2-4 QUARTS BETWEEN OIL CHANGES.  I REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED THE CONSUMPTION BUT NO MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND. JULY OF 2011 HONDA ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM WITH (TSB#11-033). IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE DEALER DID AN OIL CONSUMPTION SOFTWARE UPDATE. AT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO RECALL.  THE CONTINUAL COST FOR SYNTHETIC OIL REMAINED AND THE OIL LIGHT NEVER CAME ON. AN OIL CONSUMPTION RECALL ISSUED IN 2015. THE CAR FAILED THE OIL TEST HONDA DID  REQUIRED SERVICE AS PER RECALL PROTOCOL.  THE TECH INDICATED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BUT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.   HONDA AGREED TO PAY 50% OF THE CC REPAIR.  I DECLINED SINCE I HAVE NO MONEY FOR THIS DUE TO UNEMPLOYMENT, NOR SHOULD I PUT ONE CENT INTO A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DEFECTIVE FROM THE START.  MY CAR WAS ALSO RECALLED FOR TAKATA AIRBAGS. HONDA PROVIDED A RENTAL CAR FOR 2.5 MONTHS. I PICKED UP THE CAR AND NOW THE ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, BRAKES MALFUNCTIONING AND COMPROMISED CC.

DESPITE BEING AWARE OF THE ISSUE, HONDA IS PRESENTLY REFUSING TO SERVICE THE VEHICLES OR TO PROVIDE RENTAL OR LOANER VEHICLES; INSTEAD, THEY ARE SIMPLY ADVISING INDIVIDUALS NOT TO SIT IN THE FRONT-PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THEY CAN FIX IT (MONTHS FROM NOW).     THIS IS COMPLETELY AND HORRIBLY UNACCEPTABLE; THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN NUMEROUS FATALITIES AND HONDA IS EXERCISING WILLFUL NEGLIGENCE IN SENDING THESE VEHICLES BACK OUT ON THE ROAD. THESE ARE FAMILY VEHICLES, AND ARE MARKETED AS SUCH; WITHOUT USE OF A FRONT-PASSENGER SEAT THE CARS BECOME SLIGHTLY CLASSIER REGULAR CAB PICKUP TRUCKS. MOREOVER, THE OWNER'S MANUAL CITES IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WHICH COULD UNDERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PRESSURE MONITORS WHICH ARE TO MONITOR THE PRESENCE OF A PASSENGER IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, MEANING THAT ALL PASSENGERS AND THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE ARE STILL IN DANGER OF FLYING METAL SHRAPNEL DECAPITATING THEM IN AN ACCIDENT.  HONDA'S POSITION (AS STATED BOTH AT AUTONATION 385 IN MEMPHIS, TN AND VIA THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINT CENTER AT (888)-234-2138) IS THAT THEY CAN DO NOTHING, AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD SIT NEAR THAT AIRBAG.

IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO GET THIS PROBLEM SOLVED BECAUSE ONE CAN'T HELP DRIVING IN RAIN AT TIMES.",

IT WAS ALMOST OUT OF OIL, EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINING SERVICE SINCE BUYING THE VEHICLE NEW IN APRIL, 2010.  THE HONDA DEALER SERVICED THE CAR.  I WENT BACK SHORTLY AFTER SERVICE BECAUSE WE CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS LOW AGAIN.  THEY STARTED 'OIL CONSUMPTION' TESTS.  IT WAS DOWN A BIT EVERY 1,000 MILES BUT THEY KEPT SAYING IT WAS IN THE 'NORMAL' RANGE AND THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO NEED TO ADD OIL BETWEEN OIL CHANGES (I HAVE OWNED CARS FOR 30+ YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST CAR THAT EVER NEED ADDITIONAL OIL BETWEEN CHANGES).  I KEPT TAKING IT IN FOR CONSUMPTION ISSUES.  THEY WOULD CHECK THE OIL, TOP IT OFF, AND TELL ME IT WAS 'NORMAL'.  THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THE SERVICE MANAGER PRESENTED IT TO THE REGIONAL HONDA SERVICE, BUT THEY SAID IT WAS 'NORMAL' TOO.  I STARTED TOPPING OFF THE OIL MYSELF AS THE DEALERSHIP IS A BIT OF A DRIVE AND I WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THE COMPLAINTS.  AT 86,000 MILES, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  I TOOK IT TO AN ACURA DEALERSHIP.  THEY SERVICED THE CAR AND RESET IT.  LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN 3 WEEKS LATER.  IT NEEDS A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER @$1,100.  BOUGHT HONDA CARE EXTENDED WARRANTY AT DEALER WITH CAR, BUT IT DOESN'T COVER THE PART.  HONDA IS TELLING ME THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE HONDA CARE WARRANTY IS NOT A HONDA WARRANTY, BUT 3RD PARTY AND THEY DON'T CONTROL IT.  I'M OUT $2,300 FOR THE USELESS WARRANTY AND APPEALING TO HONDA TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE OIL CONSUMPTION (WHICH THE HONDA DEALER SAID IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH CR-VS) AND THE NEED FOR A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER AT 86,000 MILES.   *TR",

THE SECOND EVENT OCCURRED WHILE PULLING INTO A FRONT END PARKING SPACE AT AN OFFICE BUILDING.  SPEED WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REGISTER ON THE ODOMETER. TAPPING THE BRAKE CAUSED THE CAR TO ACCELERATE AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, HEADING TOWARD A BRICK WALL ABOUT 8 FEET AWAY.  I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE, BUT THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE.  I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE CAR AND AVOID THE WALL, BUT TOOK OUT ALL THE FRONT PLANTINGS, A LIGHT POLE AND A SMALL TREE, DOING ALMOST $3,000 DAMAGE TO MY CAR PLUS MORE FOR THE BUILDING.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HONDA SERVICE. THEIR RESPONSE: WE COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. BRING IT BACK WHEN THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. FOR A WHILE I HAVE ACCEPTED THIS DIAGNOSIS, BUT ANOTHER OCCURRENCE COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO PROPERTY, TO ME OR TO OTHERS.  I HAVE READ OF OTHER INCIDENTS WITH THIS VEHICLE.
