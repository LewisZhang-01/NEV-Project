I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PHONE [XXX] BUT HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM AS OF YET (3 HOURS)   I HAVE GONE INTO FURTHER DEPT WITH RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE STEP...I HAVE FOUND TWO FORUMS WITH MULTIPLE PAGES OF THIS EXACT PROBLEM....INJURIES HAVE OCCURRED, EVEN TO AN EMPLOYER.   SOME HAVE CONTACTED THE WARRANTY, AFTER EXPIRATION AND HAD IT REPLACED ANYHOW DUE TO THE MANY COMPLAINTS. THE STEPS WERE REPLACED WITH A KWIKEE BRAND, WHICH HAS REPORTED TO BE BETTER BUILT. MANY, AS MYSELF, ARE SURPRISED AS TO WHY THIS STEP PROBLEM HAS NOT BECOME A \"RECALL\"  I AM SEEKING FOR THE STEP TO BE REPLACED FOR FREE, THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEMATIC ORDEAL, NO FOLLOW UP CALLS FROM CORDELIA AND NO ANSWER FROM LIPPERT WHEN I CALL AS EMAIL INSTRUCTED.

THE DEFECT IS SEVERE BLISTERING (OR BUBBLING) WHICH OCCURS OVER THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HYDRAULIC LINE.  AS THE SYSTEM OPERATES AT HIGH PRESSURE, THESE BLISTERS WILL EVENTUALLY RUPTURE CAUSING A COMPLETE LOSE OF HYDRAULIC FLUID AND PRESSURE WITHIN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  THIS LACK OF PRESSURE WILL CAUSE ALL OF THE STABILIZER JACKS TO FALL/DEPLOY AND FOR THE POTENTIAL ROOM SLIDE EXTENSIONS TO EXTEND/DEPLOY. THIS IS AN DANGEROUS/EXTREME/SERIOUS HAZARD IF THIS HAPPENS AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  FOREST RIVER ADMITS TO THE DEFECT AND HAS RECENTLY CHANGED HOSE MANUFACTURES.
