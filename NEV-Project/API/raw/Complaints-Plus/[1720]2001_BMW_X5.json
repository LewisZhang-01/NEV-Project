I COULD SMELL OIL AND NOTICED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS SMOKING OUT THE EXHAUST PIPE.   I WENT TO THE NEAREST SERVICE STATION AND TURNED OFF MY VEHICLE TO CHECK THE OIL.  WHEN I PULLED OUT THE DIP STICK, OIL SHOT OUT OF THE HOLE AND SPRAYED ALL OVER THE INTERIOR OF MY HOOD, ON MY FACE AND ALL OVER MY CLOTHING.  THE OIL CRANKCASE HAD BECOME PRESSURIZED AND WAS FORCING THE OIL OUT THE ENGINE, THROUGH THE RINGS AND VALVE COVERS.  AFTER WIPING OFF MY FACE, HANDS AND CLOTHING THE BEST I COULD, I ADDED THREE QUARTS OF OIL TO RETURN THE LEVEL TO ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS.  REPAIRS NEEDED TO GET NEW GASKETS AND OIL SEPARATOR, PCV VALVE, DIP STICK GUIDE TUBE AND HOSES.  THESE REPAIRS COST $1690.  LATER I UNDERSTOOD THAT BMW WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAD ISSUED A SERVICE INFORMATION BULLETIN # SI B 11 08 03 TO ITS SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I ALSO HEARD THAT MORE THAN 100 SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRED IN MINNEAPOLIS DURING THE FIRST COLD SPELL OF THIS SEASON.  BMW SHOULD HAVE INFORMED OWNERS OF BMW OF THE NEED TO REPLACE PCV VALVES IF REQUIRED TO BOTH PREVENT POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO CARS AND DRIVERS WHO LIKE MYSELF RESPONDED TO THE SITUATION AND ENDED UP BEING SPRAYED BY WARM ENGINE OIL.  A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD EXISTED WITH OIL BEING FORCED FROM MY CRANKCASE INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  *TR",

(4) WITHIN THE PAST THREE YEARS, I HAVE HAD THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW REGULATOR REPLACED THREE TIMES.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM W/BMWS.  (5) I NOW MUST ROLL DOWN MY WINDOW AND OPEN MY DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE THE DOOR HANDLE JAMS AND WON'T ALLOW ME TO OPEN DOOR FROM THE INSIDE. THIS HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES ALREADY, ($1,000 TO FIX). (6) BOTH FRONT HEADLIGHTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE ALREADY - AND OF COURSE THE DEALER RECOMMENDS REPLACING THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY AT $200 A POP. (7) THE BOTH FRONT DOOR LOCK ACTUATORS ARE DEFECTIVE AND NEED TO BE REPLACED ($400 EACH).  IT WILL NOT LOCK/UNLOCK THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR SO WE MUST DO SO MANUALLY.  (8) THE REAR HATCH WOULD NOT OPEN PROPERLY.  THE LATCH ASSEMBLY HAD TO BE REPLACED TWICE (THANKFULLY UNDER WARRANTY) BEFORE OUR PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED. (9) THE LEFT REAR TAIL LAMP ASSEMBLY IS NOW BEING REPLACED FOR THE THIRD TIME ($259) BECAUSE THE BULB CONTINUES TO GO OUT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.

THAT POSE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD, AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE IN DEALING WITH THE MATTER.  I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA.    I AM AN ACTIVE DUTY ARMY OFFICER STATIONED IN GARMISCH, GERMANY.  THE CAR WAS WITH US IN CALIFORNIA AND KANSAS FROM 2001 TO 2004.  THE CAR DID NOT HAVE THE DOOR FREEZING PROBLEMS WHILE UNDER WARRANTY; WE KEPT IT IN A GARAGE AND THE BOWDEN CABLES DID NOT GET WET DURING COLD WEATHER.  WE HAVE NO GARAGE HERE, AND ANY TIME THE WEATHER GETS A FEW DEGREES BELOW FREEZING, THE FRONT DOORS CEASE TO OPERATE.  ONE MUST RUN THE CAR BETWEEN 15 MINUTES TO 1.5 HOURS BEFORE THE DOORS OPERATE NORMALLY.  WHEN THE CAR COOLS DOWN, THE DOORS FREEZE AGAIN.     THE PROBLEM WITH THE DOORS HERE IN GERMANY IS SEVERE AND POSES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK; DOES BMW REALLY WANT TO RISK LITIGATION FOR SOMEONE TRAPPED IN THE CAR IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT?  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE CAR WAS NOT RECALLED FOR SUCH A SERIOUS AND ACKNOWLEDGED SAFETY DESIGN DEFECT.       OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP IN GARMISCH IS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE BELOW SI IN HIS DATABASE.  HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I AM ALSO DISTURBED THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY UPWARDS OF $1000 TO FIX THE PROBLEM---THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED WHEN THE CAR WENT UNDER SERVICES IN LATE WINTER OF 2004 (AND ALSO HAD OTHER SI WORK DONE, SUCH AS A FAULTY RADIATOR FAN THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE CAR TO BURN----HECK OF A COMBINATION IF THE FREEZING DOORS HAD BEEN ACTING UP AT THE SAME TIME!).*AK",
