I HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS WHEN IT WAS SHIFTING VERY HARD AND NEARLY SNAPPING MY NECK.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE VW DEALERSHIP OVER 30 TIMES WITHIN A YEARS TIME AND THEY CONTINUED TO TELL ME NOTHING WAS WRONG. THEY KEPT THE CAR AND DROVE IT AND IT OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN WHILE THEY DROVE IT.  THEY ACTUALLY TOLD ME I WAS DRIVING THE CAR INCORRECTLY (WHAT THAT MEANS I DON'T KNOW).   I WAS UNAWARE OF THE LEMON LAW AT THE TIME.  THE CAR CONTINUED TO SHIFT EXTREMELY HARD.  FINALLY AFTER IT WENT BACK FOR THE 30TH TIME I DEMANDED THAT THEY KEEP THE CAR AND DRIVE IT UNTIL IT HAPPENED.  FINALLY AFTER 2 WEEKS (THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME A LOANER) THE MECHANIC CALLED ME STATING THAT IT NEARLY SNAPPED HIS NECK AND THAT THEY WOULD PUT IN A NEW TRANSMISSION (REBUILT MIND YOU).  AFTER GETTING IT BACK ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER THE CAR WOULD NOT GO IN REVERSE AND WAS MAKING THE WORST NOISE EVER BUT I CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION ONCE AGAIN (ANOTHER REBUILT TRANSMISSION).  THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD WAS THE LOCKS ON THE CAR. SOME OF THE DOORS LOCK WITH THE KEY FOB  WHILE THE BACK DOORS DON'T WORK WITH THE FOB OR THE SWITCH ON THE DOOR PANEL.

SO FAR,  IF ENGINE IS SHUT OFF AND THEN RESTARTED,  THE TRANSMISSION WILL AGAIN FUNCTION NORMALLY.  I BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED 4 OR 5 TIMES NOW. ON ONE OCCASION,  THE CAR WAS IN AN INTERSECTION WHEN IT BECAME IMMOVABLE WHICH PRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD.I CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF INFO ON MANY VW INTERNET SITES ABOUT THIS ISSUE, IN FACT IF YOU SIMPLY GOOGLE 'VW DSG FLASHING PRNDS'  OR 'VW DSG TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS' ANYONE CAN FIND IT.  IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  I SEE THAT HHTSA HAS BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION BASED ON THIS  FOR 2007 THRU 2009 MODEL YEARS, OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM ON 2005/2006 VW WITH DSG TRANSMISSION AS WELL.  VW  HAS INITIATED A NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS RELATED TO CERTAIN DSG EQUIPPED MODELS BUT APPARENTLY MINE (AND MANY OTHERS) ARE NOT COVERED THEY SAY BY THIS PROGRAM- NEVERTHELESS A SAFETY ISSUE EXISTS WITH 2005 AND 2006 DSG EQUIPPED VW'S.  I CALLED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE (NATIONAL) TODAY 11/3/11 AND REP SAID \"I AM NOT AWARE OF THIS ISSUE' FOR THIS YEAR- SO THEY ARE EITHER LYING OR INCREDIBLY UNDERINFORMED.  I HAD THE CAR TO VW DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS,  AND THEY STATED THAT A DIAGNOSTIC TEST SHOWED A MALFUNCTION IN A PART THAT CONTROLS TRANSMISSION OPERATION AND WAS CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL BY ITSELF.  THEIR RECOMMENDATION,  \"SPEND $2000 TO REPLACE THE PART,  OR JUST GET A NEW TRANSMISSION = $4000.  SINCE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY RELATED DESIGN FLAW THAT ALLOWS THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT ITSELF INTO NEUTRAL- I FEEL THE NHTSA SHOULD EXPAND THE INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE ALL YEARS OF VW DSG TRANSMISSION EQUIPPED VEHICLES SOLD IN THE USA.  *TR",

ONE, WHEN THE CAR IS FIRST STARTED UP, A CLANGING NOISE OCCURS AND LASTS FOR APPROX 30 SECONDS, THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE A VENT CLOSES AND THE SOUND GOES AWAY.  TWO, THE RIGHT FRONT HEADLIGHT WILL NOT TURN OFF SOMETIMES WHEN I PULL ALONG SIDE A CURB.  I HAVE TO RESTART THE CAR, BACK THE CAR UP, THEN PULL THE CAR FORWARD TO GET IT TO TURN OFF.  THE THIRD ITEM OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY NOT ALWAYS AND INVOLVES SHIFTING OF GEARS.  WHEN THE CAR IS GOING APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 30 MILES PER HOUR, IT SEEMS TO BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD GEAR A LITTLE ROUGH BUT NOT JERKY AND SOMETIMES WHEN COASTING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION THE CAR SEEMS TO HESITATE WHEN I AM READY TO PUSH ON THE GAS.  BUT THEN, AFTER A COUPLE SECONDS, ENGAGES INTO GEAR WITH A LUNGE.  I RECENTLY TOOK THE CAR TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP FOR ANALYSIS AND THE MAN SAID HE COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY CODES.  I TOLD HIM I HAD RECEIVED THE LETTER ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION'S VALVE BODY WARRANTY EXTENSION.  HE DROVE THE CAR AND SAID THE CAR DEFINITELY LUNGES AND TOLD ME TO GET IT TO A VW DEALERSHIP FOR A CHECK UP AS HE WAS NOT AN AUTHORIZED VW TECH.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP WHICH IS 2 HOURS AWAY FROM MY HOME.  THEY DROVE THE CAR 3 SEPARATE TIMES TRYING TO PRODUCE THE SCENARIO I DESCRIBED BUT COULD NOT.  THE TECH TOLD ME IT SOUNDED LIKE I WAS DESCRIBING THE VALVE BODY ISSUE AND HE WOULD TELL THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT HE HAD FELT THE PROB AND THAT MY CAR NEEDED A NEW VALVE BODY.  WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR, THE CAR WOULD NOT DRIVE ABOVE 20 MPH WITHOUT THE ENGINE ROARING AND THE SHIFTING HARD INTO GEAR EVERYTIME.  ME AND MY DAUGHTER HAD PULLED OUT INTO A VERY BUSY 40 MPH TRAFFIC.  IT WAS SCARY. AT ONE POINT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO ANY GEAR! I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG.  NEXT DAY, THEY TOLD ME MY CAR NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION AT MY COST OF $5000. WHAT HAPPEN?  *TR",

THEY TOLD US IT SOUNDED LIKE THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL WAS THE PROBLEM. THAT THERE WAS 2 DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS THAT MAKE THE FLYWHEELS AND THEY NO LONGER USE ONE OF THE MANUFACTURERS DUE TO DEFECTS AND PROBLEMS WITH THE FLYWHEELS THEY MADE. THEY SAID IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT THE FLYWHEELS WERE BAD AND WOULD NEED REPLACED WAY BEFORE THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO. EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM WAS KNOWN BY VOLKSWAGEN THEY REFUSED TO FIX REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART. THEY SAID WE COULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE IT AND BUT WOULD CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND END UP TEARING UP ALOT OF OTHER STUFF IF IT DID. WE LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM, THOUGH NO RECALL. WE ALSO READ WHERE IF THE FLYWHEEL LOCKED UP/CAME APART WHILE DRIVING IT COULD LOCKUP THE ENTIRE CAR. WE DID COME ACROSS WHERE THE FLYWHEEL HAD BEEN RECALLED IN EUROPE. THE CAR WAS DROVE TILL NOVEMBER 2010 WHEN IT HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD DOWNSHIFT ON HILLS AND WHEN YOU WOULD TRY TO GET UP SPEED TO MERGE ONTO THE INTERSTATE IT WOULD NOT SHIFT TO THE NEXT GEAR( BUT THE RPMS WERE NORMAL) AND WAS FORCED TO MERGE ONTO THE INTERSTATE AT A VERY SLOW AND UNSAFE SPEED. THE ENGINE ALSO HAD A VERY LOUD CHATTER NOISE. WE DECIDED TO HAVE IT FIXED AND REPLACED THE FLYWHEEL ASSY & MOUNT BOLTS AND HAD TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID FLUSHED AND REFILLED AND A NEW FILTER PUT IN. TOTALING $1423.00. THE NEW FLYWHEEL WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL ONE. IT NOW RUNS GREAT. SHIFTS PERFECTLY AND SMOOTHLY. *TR",

THE FINAL BILL CAME TO 2164.71 DOLLARS. THE PRESSURE PLATE AND FLYWHEEL SHOWED NO SIGNS OF ABUSE OR BURNING. THE CLUTCH HAD PLENTY OF PAD LEFT BUT WAS BROKEN DUE TO THE FORCE OF ENGAGING AT 60 MILE PER HOUR IN SECOND GEAR. THE MECHANICS REASON FOR FAILURE WAS \"PRESSURE PLATE BLEW OUT\" AND MY BOSS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER SAID IT LOOK LIKE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE NOT A WEAR ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW WHY VW GET TO WASH THEIR HANDS OF THIS UNDER A CAME OF THEY DON'T COVER CLUTCH PARTS UNDER WARRANTY AND WHY I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. IF THIS COULD HAPPEN ON A HIGHWAY IT COULD ALSO HAVE HAPPEN AT A STOP LIGHT.  *TR",

THE VW DEALER STATED THAT THERE WERE NO FAULTY VW PARTS; FAILURE WAS DUE TO A WORN CLUTCH, WHICH I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH VW OF AMERICA. I WAS SUSPICIOUS OF THIS DIAGNOSIS, SINCE THE CLUTCH FAILED SO SUDDENLY & IN ALL OF MY YEARS OF DRIVING MANUAL TRANSMISSION CARS (16 YEARS), I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO REPLACE A WORN OR DAMAGED CLUTCH.    THE DEALER REPLACED THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, WHICH COST ME $2,070. THE DEALER STATED THAT THIS REPAIR IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, & THAT HE WOULD SHOW ME THE WORN CLUTCH WHEN THE REPAIR WAS FINISHED.    WHEN I PICKED UP THE REPAIRED CAR, I ASKED TO SEE THE CLUTCH & FLYWHEEL (FOR SIGNS OF WEAR & HEAT MARKS). THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION; THEY WERE ALREADY DISPOSED OF & IN THE GARBAGE DUMPSTER.    AFTER READING SO MANY COMPLAINTS MADE BY EXPERIENCED MANUAL TRANSMISSION DRIVERS ABOUT VW CLUTCHES WEARING PREMATURELY, I BELIEVE THAT THIS CASE MAY BE DUE TO A DEFECTIVE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    I'VE READ ON VW TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS THAT FAULTY PRESSURE PLATES AND/OR FLYWHEELS IN THESE NEWER JETTAS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE DAMAGE & EXCESSIVE PREMATURE WEAR TO THE CLUTCH.  IN MY CASE, I WASN'T ABLE TO INSPECT THE OLD CLUTCH ASSEMBLY FOR OTHER SIGNS OF MECHANICAL FAILURE (SINCE THE DEALER DISPOSED OF THE OLD PARTS BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THEM).     SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT VW CLUTCHES, I HOPE THEY ISSUE A RECALL & REIMBURSE THE MANY CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE NEEDED TO REPLACE THEIR CLUTCHES SO SOON. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT HAVING TO SPEND $2,070 TO REPAIR A FAULTY CLUTCH IN A CAR THAT IS ONLY 2 YRS OLD. FOR MY NEXT CAR PURCHASE, I AM CONSIDERING BUYING FROM A DIFFERENT CAR COMPANY. *JB",

ON JULY 2, 2006 WHILE ON VACATION THE CLUTCH COMPLETELY FAILED AFTER DRIVING SEVERAL MILES IN BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC IT STARTED SMOKING AND THEN THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THE CLUTCH LOCKED UP. THE VEHICLE THEN HAD ABOUT 14-15,000 MILES ON IT.  A MAINE DEALER  DETERMINED THAT THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER HAD FAILED AND THE ENTIRE CLUTCH FAILED.  TOOK MORE THAN TWO WEEKS TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE.  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED BY OUR VIRGINIA DEALER IT WAS REPORTED TO US THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS CRACKED DUE TO IMPROPER RE-INSTALLATION. VEHICLE THEN HAD 17632 MILES ON IT. IT TOOK ANOTHER TWO WEEKS TO FORCE THE MAINE DEALER TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION AND REPLACE IT.

HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW THE CAR WAS DAMAGED, I SAID NO. THE SALESMAN HAD SAID IT HAD NEVER BEEN WRECKED AND IF IT HAD BEEN WRECKED THEY WOULD SELL THE CAR AT WHOLESALE.   THE SERVICE TECH AT NORTH POINT SHOWED ME THE FUEL PUMP/FUEL GAUGE-SENDING UNIT HAD BEEN BROKEN. HE SAID THE ONLY TIME THEY HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IS IF A CAR HAD BEEN IN A WRECK. THEY PUT THE CAR ON THE LIFT AND FOUND THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN REPAIRED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. WE FOUND BAD WELDS, AND NO PAINT/RUST PROTECTANT.   HILEY PAID FOR THE FUEL PUMP TO BE REPLACED.   IF YOU LOOK AT THE VW WEB SITE FOR CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED YOU'D SEE THAT IT SHOWS UNDER THE UNDERBODY TAB \"NO SIGN OF DAMAGE\".  I CALLED HILEY VW TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS. TO WHICH THEY SAID, \"THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO.\" (HILEY, GENERAL MANAGER).  I HAVE HAD HILEY FIX A SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND CHECK FOUR WHEEL ALIGNMENT ON THE CAR. AFTER I ARGUED WITH GENERAL MANAGER ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR. I'M TIRED OF ARGUING!  WHICH I HAD TO DRIVE TO ARLINGTON.  THE AIR BAG LIGHT IN ON NOW. I TOOK THE CAR INTO MOFFITT VW. THEY SAY IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT BELT.  THERE'S A FLAW IN THE WINDSHIELD. THERE ARE NO  DOORSILL PROTECTORS ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR. THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT WILL NOT LOCK INTO PLACE.  THERE MAY BE MORE WRONG WITH THE CAR, I HAVE STOPPED LOOKING.  I HAVE SUBMITTED A CONSUMER COMPLAINT FORM WITH THE TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THE ARKANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.  I HAVE ALSO SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT FORM WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN \"CERTIFIED\"? IS IT JUST A WAY TO DUMP A NOT \"UP TO SNUFF\" CAR ON AN UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMER?",

AT HOME WE DUPLICATES WHAT HAPPENED AND DETERMINED WE NEEDED TO TURN THE KEY COMPLETELY TO THE OFF POSITION, THEN WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESTART THE ENGINE. WE DRIVE MOSTLY MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS AND CANNOT THINK OF ANY TIME WE HAVE HAD TO TURN THE KEY COMPLETELY TO THE OFF POSITION TO GET OUR VEHICLES STARTED. WE CALLED AND TALKED WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS A NEW FEATURE VW INSTITUTED THIS YEAR TO KEEP DRIVERS FROM TRYING TO RESTART AN ENGINE THAT MAY ALREADY BE RUNNING AND POSSIBLY RUINING THE STARTER. RUINING THE STARTER WAS THE LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS.   WE ARE CONCERNED THE DOCUMENTATION THAT OUTLINES THAT THE DRIVER MUST RETURN THE KEY TO THE 0FF POSITION EVERY TIME TO RESTARTED THE ENGINE IS BURIED ON PG 92 OF BOOKLET 3.1 IN SECTION IGNITION LOCK POSITION OF THE KEY. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT SOMETHING A DRIVER WOULD NORMALLY LOOK FOR OR EXPECT FROM THE VEHICLE THEY ARE DRIVING. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS FEATURE BE CHANGED SO THAT IF A DRIVER STALLS THEIR VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY IN A COMPROMISING SITUATION, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE WITH THE KEY BEING ANYWHERE IN THE ON POSITION. IN ADDITION, UNTIL THIS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS INFORMATION BE INCLUDED IN THE JETTA QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE. THIS IS A MORE REASONABLE PLACE THE DRIVER MAY LOOK INSTEAD OF BEING BURIED DEEP INSIDE THE DRIVERS MANUAL. I ALSO RECOMMEND THIS BE INFORMATION THE DEALERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE THE DRIVER KNOWS BEFORE LEAVING THEIR LOT. THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING OF A POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUE.  *NM",

DECEMBER OF 2004 WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED PROBLEMS WITH THE CLUTCH DISENGAGING FROM THE FLYWHEEL WHILE SHIFTING UP OR DOWN AND WHILE PASSING CARS. I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THE CAR (SINCE 2001) HAS A DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL ASSEMBLY INSTALLED BY VW THAT IS AT ROOT OF PROBLEM. THE TWO LAYERED FLYWHEEL IS BECOMING OVER HEATED AND WARPING THE CLUTCH DISC ABNORMALLY IN CERTAIN SPOTS. SOME MECHANICS AND ENGINEERS HAVE SPECUALATED IMPROPER DESIGN, AND OTHERS SAID TRANSMISSION BOLTS AROUND FLYWHEEL WERE PROBABLY OVERTIGHTENED AT MANUFACTURER. EITHER WAY, OUR CLUTCH IS DISENGAGING BY ITSELF FROM THE FLYWHEEL AFTER WE DRIVE CAR FOR 60 OR 70 MILES AT ONE TIME (AND CAR IS HEATED UP). THE CLUTCH DISENGAGES AFTER SHIFING UP OR DOWN AND SOMETIMES WHILE PASSING, CAUSING PROBLEMS NEGOTIATING SPEEDS. THIS MEANS LACK OF CONTROL FROM THE DRIVER WHICH EQUALS SAFETY HAZARD FOR MOST. OUR CAR STARTED THIS AT 11,500 MILES, BUT DEALER IS REFUSING WARRANTY WORK BECAUSE HIS SERVICE ADVISOR FAILED TO NOTE THE PROBLEM WE REQUESTED TO HAVE CHECKED ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. DEALER IS ALSO DENYING IT IS A CLUTCH/FLYWHEEL PROBLEM SINCE HE CAN NOT DUPLICATE IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES, BUT HAS REFUSED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER.
