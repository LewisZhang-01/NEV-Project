But they refused to do anything about it. They stated there is no recall and it\u2019s my responsibility to fix it. The fix is not cheap as the CVT requires a brand new transmission that must be programmed specifically to your vehicle. They were not taking responsibility for the issue that they know is a problem. It is very frustrating to own a vehicle with a company who refuses to fix something they know is wrong. They are not the only ones who mentioned there is an issue. The dealer themselves have seen this numerous times and advised Nissan won\u2019t do anything to make it right with any consumers. This poses a safety hazard in my eyes. Had this gone out at 60 mph it would not shift and could have been a significant safety risk. I am now out over $5,000 to fix the transmission. This is an unacceptable practice and they should be held responsible for continuing the this do nothing and not be forced to make a change in their production and design.",
