I WENT FOR MAINTENANCE AND WHEN RAISING THE VEHICLE THE TECHNICIAN GOT EXCITED AND STOPPED   HE CALLED ME OVER TO SHOW ME MY DRIVER SIDE FRAME RAIL WAS SO DETERIORATED HE WAS UNSURE HE COULD SAFELY  RAISE THE VEHICLE. I WAS SHOCKED. BECAUSE I HAD THE TRUCK FROM THE DEALER BRAND NEW AND KNEW THE CARE IN WHICH THE TRUCK RECEIVED. THE TRUCK IS UNSAFE AND THOUGHT I COULD JUST BUY A REPAIR. THE REPAIR COST AS MUCH AS BUYING A DIFFERENT TRUCK WHICH I DID. SAME ONE. AND GUESS WHAT THE SAME PROBLEM. RUST OVER THE WHEEL, BUMPER AND YES THE FRAME RAIL. I COULD POKE MY FINGER THOUGHT IT AND IT WOULD FALL APART. I CALLED DODGE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN FOR THE AMOUNT OF TRUCKS LIKE THIS ON THE ROAD. THEY TOLD ME MY TRUCK WAS OLD AND THAT'S WHY. FOR A COMPANY TO ADVERTISE THEIR TRUCKS BEING THE TOUGHEST ON THE PLANT I DON'T THINK SO. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS MY SON HAS A 1986 FORD TRUCK WHICH EVERYTHING FELL OFF EXCEPT THE FRAME, ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE A TRUCK WHICH ALL WORKS AND I CAN'T DRIVE. I'M SURE A LITTLE INVESTIGATION YOU WILL FIND 100000S OF THESE BROKEN FRAME TRUCKS THAT MOST DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HAPPENING. IT'S UNSAFE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A VEHICLE TO PROVIDE PROTECTION IN CASE OF THE UNTHINKABLE. BUT DODGE HANDED OUT A BUNCH OF TRUCKS THAT HAVE TICKING TIME BOMBS IN THEM. I IMAGINE THE VEHICLE RESPONDING MUCH DIFFERENTLY IF IN A COLLISION WITH A RUSTED UN SUPPORTED FRAME. JUST LIKE A HOUSE IN FLORIDA WITHOUT BUILDING FOR A HURRICANE TO PASS. I FEEL DODGE COVERED UP THE PROBLEM  AND SACRIFICED THE VERY PEOPLE THAT KEPT THEM IN BUSINESS. I WILL CONTINUE TO BRING LIGHT TO THIS AND I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. A VEHICLE THAT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND VALUELESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.",

I WAS ON A SLIGHT INCLINE SO I WAS ABLE TO COAST IN A PARKING SPACE AND APPLY THE PARKING BRAKE. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK I SEEN THE FLUID POURING OUT.

WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED THE DRIVER WAS LOADING THE TRUCK ONTO THE FLAT BED AND THAT'S WHEN MYSELF AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER SEEN A SILVER DOLLAR SIZE HOLE ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE PUMPKIN JUST BELOW THE DRIVE SHAFT. I CONTACTED MY MECHANIC AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS INCIDENT AND LET HIM KNOW I WOULD BE SENDING THE TRUCK TO HIM FOR FURTHER INSPECTION. MY MECHANIC CONTACTED ME ON SEPT 15, 2015 AND INFORMED ME THAT THE PINION SHAFT SNAPPED OFF THE GEAR AND THE HOLE I SEEN WAS THE SHAFT TRYING TO COME THROUGH THE HOUSING.

I WAS ONLY DRIVING ABOUT 7MPH THROUGH THE PARKING LOT., HAD I BEEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THIS COULD HAVE ENDED FATAL FOR ME OR ANYONE TRAVELING NEXT TOO ME.

I WAS ABLE TO GAIN MY BALANCE AND STEP DOWN FROM THE RUNNING BOARDS WITHOUT DOING ANY INJURY.  I AM OF AVERAGE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT APPROPRIATE.  WHEN I EXAMINED THE HANDLE I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE ONLY MOUNTING INVOLVED WAS PLASTIC WITH A BOLT THROUGH IT SCREWED TO THE DOOR FRAME.  THIS IN NO WAY SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS AN APPROPRIATE ASSIST HANDLE TO AID ONE IN THE ENTRY OF THE VEHICLE.",

OTHER ISSUE IS THAT SAME VEHICLE'S DASHBOARD SPLINTERED AND FELL APART, FORCING ME TO REPLACE THE DASHBOARD.  I SENT CHRYSLER A REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DASHBOARD (DID NOT CHARGE FOR LABOR, JUST DASHBOARD), IN THE AMOUNT OF $295.68 -- AND THEY REFUSE TO REIMBURSE ME FOR A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT!!!  IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET THAT THESE DASHBOARDS FALL APART -- YET THEY REFUSE TO ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY, SAYING THERE IS NO RECALL ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM.  A DASHBOARD THAT SPLINTERS AND CRACKS, FOR NO APPARENT REASON, IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE???  I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER THAT THE DASHBOARD FALLS APART BECAUSE OF \"ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\" (I.E.

THE ALUMINUM DRIVESHAFT WAS SPLIT IN 2 AND THERE WAS OIL ALL OVER THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK AND ON THE GROUND. THE TRUCK WOULD NOT ROLL AT ALL AND A FLAT BED NEEDED TO BE USED TO BRING THE TRUCK BACK TO POTAMKIN PLANET DODGE.

THE REBUILT REPLACEMENT AXEL COST ME $4334.01.  THE REASON I'M NOW SENDING THIS IN IS BECAUSE I JUST SAW THE RECALL NOTICE THAT WENT OUT FOR THE 2004 AND UP TRUCKS AND WHEN I READ THE DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HAD SUBMITTED ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS I REALIZED HOW SIMILAR EVERYONE'S STORY WAS AND THAT MY SITUATION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN JUST DUMB LUCK DUE TO A SIMPLE MECHANICAL FAILURE. THE MECHANICS THAT WORKED ON MY TRUCK WERE NOT SURPRISED AT ALL AND MADE IT SEEM LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON FAILURE ON THESE TRUCKS AND I DIDN'T EVEN THINK AT THE TIME THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY DEFECT.

AFTER WE REPLACED THE COMPUTER THE REAR END OF THE TRUCK LOCKED UP AT 65 MILES AN HOUR THANK GOD THE SEAT BELT ARE THE ONLY THING IN THIS VEHICLE THAT ARE WORKING AND THANK GOD WE WERE NOT GOING ANY FASTER AND SOME ONE OTHER THAN ME WAS DRIVING BECAUSE THINGS COULD HAVE ENDED VERY BADLY. IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIX THE REAR END WE COULD ONLY FIND TWO REAR ENDS IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA THAT SOLD FOR 1600.00 DOLLARS WITH OVER 90,000 MILES ON THEM THE REST WERE COMPLETELY MANGLED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. THE MORE PART SERVICE PEOPLE I HAVE TALKED TO ALL SAID THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE. AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO HAVE BOTH REAR TIRES LOCK UP AT 65 AND YOUR BACK END BOUNCE AND THROW YOU TWO LANES OVER. I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED A CHRYSLER MANUFACTURE THAT SAID IN 2006 THEY STOPPED SELLING THAT REAR END AS A WHOLE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE HAD WITH IT! I THINK THIS PART NEEDS TO BE RECALLED NOT ONLY FOR THE AMOUNT WE HAVE HAD TO SPEND JUST TO KEEP THIS TRUCK RUNNING BUT FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS. WHEN YOU BY A VEHICLE YOU KNOW ABOUT REGULAR MAINTENANCE BUT THESE PARTS THAT ARE FAILING ARE COSTING MORE THAN OUR TRUCK IS WORTH.

STARTING IN DEC. 2010 THE DEFROSTER INSTEAD OF STICKING ONCE IN A WHILE AND REQUIRING A SWITCH FROM DEFROST TO VENT BACK TO DEFROST TO GET IT TO WORK, STARTED NOT WORKING.      DODGE WILL NOT REPAIR THE DEFROST ISSUE WHICH IS A SAFETY ISSUE UNLESS I REPLACE THE DASH.    I BELIEVE THAT THE CRACKED DASH WHICH BY ITSELF IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT IS MORE A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND POOR ENGINEERING EFFORT BECOMES A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN IT MUST BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF ISSUES THAT OCCUR WITH THE DEFROST SYSTEM.    MANY TIMES I HAVE DRIVEN THIS TRUCK IN BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS WHERE I NEED THE DEFROSTER JUST TO SEE OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE FOGGING OCCURS WHILE I AM DRIVING (TYPICALLY ON A HIGHWAY/INTERSTATE).  NOW I'M FORCED TO REPLACE SOMETHING \"COSMETIC\" OR \"NOT A SAFETY ISSUE\" DUE TO SOMETHING THAT IS?    THE ISSUES WITH THE DEFROST BREAKING ARE COMMON.  I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE NHTSA TO REQUIRE DODGE TO REPLACE OR REPAIR BROKER DEFROSTERS AS THESE SYSTEMS EVEN IN VEHICLES DATING BACK INTO THE 1950'S RARELY IF EVER REQUIRE ANY REPAIR AND FOR GOOD REASON...SAFETY.  IF DODGE THEN BELIEVES THE DASH NEEDS REPLACING THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED AS PART OF THE SAFETY REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS TO \"REPLACE/REPAIR AND  ALL PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS REQUIRED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE\".

THE IMPACT OF THIS CRASH DESTROYED THE TRUCK. THANKFULLY, MY WIFE WAS WEARING HER SAFETY BELT, AND SUFFERED ONLY MINOR INJURIES. THE GUIDE/SUPPORT WIRE HAD EMBEDDED ITSELF INTO THE FRONT BUMPER AND HOOD AND HAD TO BE CUT OUT. AMAZINGLY, NEITHER THE DRIVER NOR PASSENGER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED IN THIS INCIDENT.  AS THE POWER POLE HAD BROKEN IN TWO, THERE WERE LIVE ELECTRICAL WIRES AT THE SCENE. EMERGENCY CREWS TOOK NEARLY 7 HOURS TO CLEAR THE SCENE AND RESTORE POWER AND CABLE TO A LOCALIZED AREA.     SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELING IN A SSE DIRECTION ON HESPERIA AVENUE IN VICTORVILLE, CA AT APPROX. 45 MPH. THE WEATHER WAS IDEAL FOR ROAD TRAVEL: CLEAR, DRY, WINDLESS, WITH TEMPERATURE AROUND 95 F. THE VEHICLE WAS WELL-MAINTAINED AND HAD APPROX. 42,200 MILES ON IT.     I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH INTO THIS MATTER AND FOUND PRIOR INSTANCES OF SIMILAR AIRBAG NON-DEPLOYMENTS IN CHRYSLER VEHICLES. IN MY OPINION, IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE TOO FEW, AND'OR POORLY LOCATED, AND'OR DEFECTIVE AIRBAG SENSORS ON THIS AND OTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCTS.    THIS IS NOT A TOTAL CONDEMNATION OF CHRYSLER OR THE DODGE RAM. WE ENJOYED THIS TRUCK VERY MUCH FOR OVER 7 YEARS.

SOME USERS HAVE REPORTED NEEDING TO COMPLETE THIS REPAIR MORE THAN ONCE OVER THE VEHICLE LIFETIME, WHICH FURTHER CONFIRMS THERE IS AN INHERENT RELIABILITY PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.  OTHER USERS REPORT SIMILAR ISSUES WITH WINDSHIELD WIPERS REPORTEDLY DUE TO THE SAME UNIT FAILURE.  BECAUSE DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCKS HAVE AT LEAST TEN DIFFERENT MODEL CATEGORIES AND MULTIPLE MODEL YEARS FOR REPORTING IN THE NHTSA ONLINE REPORTING STRUCTURE, THE COMPLAINTS ARE SPREAD OUT AND THE CONCENTRATION OF PROBLEMS ENDEMIC TO THIS VEHICLE MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT TO ODI INVESTIGATORS.  COMPLAINTS MAY BE REPORTED UNDER \"1500\", \"2500\", \"3500\", \"RAM\", \"RAM 1500\", \"RAM 2500\",  \"RAM 3500\", \"RAM QUAD CAB\", \"RAM PICKUP\", \"DODGE TRUCK\", ... , ALL DUE TO THE SAME MODULE FAILURE.  COMPLAINTS ARE ALSO SPREAD OUT AMONG MANY DIFFERENT COMPLAINT CATEGORIES, FURTHER DILUTING THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS ONE FUNDAMENTAL ROOT CAUSE OF A DOZEN OR MORE DIFFERENT FAILURE MODES.  *TR",

I NOW KNOW THIS IS THE REASON WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME UNEVEN TIRE WEAR IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS ONCE IT FAILS THE FRONT END WILL FALL APART. I WOULD LIKE TO DOCUMENT THIS IN THE PROPER PLACE SO THAT RESTITUTION CAN POSSIBLY BE MADE TO US CONSUMERS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL BALL JOINTS AS \"SEALED\" THERE IS NO WAY TO MAINTAIN THEM AND ONCE THE BOOTS BUST THE BALL JOINTS FAIL - DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES INCUR.  *JB",

WHILE DRIVING ON A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT DRY ROAD, WITH COMPLETELY CLEAR VISIBILITY AT APPROX 3 PM AFTERNOON WITH VERY LIGHT TRAFFIC WE UNEXPECTEDLY FELT A HARD BUMP, AS IF WE HAD HIT A POT HOLE. IT WAS SO HARD I WAS THROWN FORWARD IN MY SEAT. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY YELLED THAT THE STEERING HAD LOCKED. HE WAS ALSO TRYING DESPERATELY TO HIT THE BRAKES, BUT THEY TOO WERE NOT WORKING. THE DRIVER STRUGGLED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO TRY AND GAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, BUT WASN'T ABLE TOO. WE DROVE DIRECTLY INTO THE LANE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. WE THEN LEFT THE LANE AND PROCEEDED INTO A PARKING AREA OF A CONVENIENCE STORE, WHERE WE STRUCK A PARKED VEHICLE. AFTER STRIKING THE PARKED VEHICLE WE WERE REDIRECTED BACK INTO THE LANE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. IT WAS AT THAT TIME WE WERE STRUCK HEAD ON BY A SEMI TRUCK. THE SEMI DROVE COMPLETELY OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE DODGE TRUCK CRUSHING ME INSIDE AND ROLLING THE SEMI. THE POLICE REPORT STATES THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER WHEEL WAS FOUND SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE WRECK. IN THE AREA WE NOTED THE INITIAL BUMP. THE VEHICLE WAS INVESTIGATED AND IT WAS FOUND THE FRONT PASSENGER BALL JOINT HAD BEEN BROKEN COMPLETELY IN HALF; HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATED STATED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS TOO SEVERE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE BALL JOINT FAILED BEFORE, OR WAS BROKEN DURING THE COLLISION.    THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 SECONDS BETWEEN THE FAILURE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND THE COLLISION. SOMETHING FAILED ON THAT VEHICLE RENDERING IT UNCONTROLLABLE. I DO HAVE THE VEHICLE IN MY POSSESSION, AND IT IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION. DODGE HAS SHOWN NO INTEREST WHAT SO EVER IN INVESTIGATING THIS POSSIBLE MECHANICAL FAILURE.   I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE INJURIES I INCURRED FROM THIS ACCIDENT. *JB",

DAIMLER SAYS UNTIL THEY HAVE A DEALER THAT COMES FORWARD WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION THEY WONT ACT ON IT. SO IN THE MEAN TIME KEEP DRIVING THE TRUCK UNTIL THIS HAPPENS. *JB",

DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM SINCE THIS HAPPENED, WOULDNT GIVE US A RENTAL CAR SAYING IT WAS OUR FAULT IT BROKE ACCUSING US OF TAKING IT 4 WHEELING AND ABUSING OUR TRUCK. OUR TRUCK IS OUR ONLY TRANSPORTATION, AND WE BOUGHT IT NEW FOR THE FACT OF RELIABILITY AND FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT WITH 3 CHILDREN. AFTER A LONG WEEK OF WAITING AND WAITING TO HEAR SOMETHING THEY SENT OUT A INVESTIGATOR TO TAKE PICTURES OF DAMAGE WHICH WAS FINALLY DONE ON THE 11TH OF JUNE, A WEEK AFTER THIS HAPPEN. STILL NO RENTAL CAR, DAIMLER SAID THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR ONE. WAS TOLD DAIMLER GOT THE PICTURES THAT WERE TAKEN ON THE 14TH, AND STILL WAS NOT REVIEWED. MY HUSBAND IS A TRUCK DRIVER AND TOOK A VACATION WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN TOO OFTEN, AND SINCE SCHOOL WAS COMING TO A END, WE WANTED TO TAKE THE KIDS AWAY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. NEEDLESS TO SAY, OUR VACATION WAS A VERY DISAPPOINTING ON. DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS ACCUSED US FOR MAKING THE AXLE BREAK, I THINK IT WAS THEIR WAY OF NOT WANTING TO TAKE OUT OF THEIR POCKET A VAHICLE FOR US TO USE. THIS IS THE 2ND WEEK NOW STILL WITH NO WORD ON IF OUR TRUCK WILL BE GETTING FIXED, IT IS NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD TO US WITH 12,000 MILES ON IT, ALWAYS BEEN SERVICED WHERE WE BOUGHT THE TRUCK AND DAIMLER EVEN DIDN'T TAKE THEIR WORD WITH THE DAMAMGE. MY HUSBAND SAID HE DAIMLER MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A CRIMINAL AND WE WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER DODGE OR CHRYSLER AND WILL ALSO TELL OTHERS THAT, AND WITH HIM BEING A TRUCK DRIVER HE CAN TELL ALOT OF PEOPLE NOT TO BUY THEIR VEHICLES. IT IS TOTALLY IS A SHAME THAT THIS COMPANY ACTS THE WAY THEY DO TO PEOPLE. I THINK DODGE IS REALLY GOING DOWN HILL.

THE NOISE SOUNDED LIKE A CONNECTING ROD KNOCK.  I CONTACTED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY ARRANGED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE DEALER, THE MECHANIC COULD NOT GET IT STARTED.  WHEN HE FINALLY GOT IT STARTED, THE ENGINE LOCKED UP.  THE ENGINE WAS TORN DOWN AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VALVE SPRING ON THE INTAKE VALVE FOR THE #6 CYLINDER HAD BROKEN IN TWO, THE VALVE HAD DROPPED INTO THE CYLINDER, FLIPPED OVER, PUNCTURED A HOLE IN THE #6 PISTON AND SNAPPED IN HALF.  THE DEALER, FENTON AUTO GROUP IN PAMPA, TEXAS HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF ARRANGING FOR A LOANER CAR, AND GETTING THE MECHANIC TO WORK ON IT IMMEDIATELY.  DODGE IS REPAIRING UNDER WARRANTY A BRAND NEW SHORT BLOCK, BRAND NEW PASSENGER SIDE HEAD, VALVE SPRING AND VALVE.  THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE PARTS IMMEDIATELY (THE NEXT DAY) AND PLAN TO HAVE IT REPAIRED QUICKLY.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT IF I WERE BUILDING OR REBUILDING AND ENGINE THAT HAD A BROKEN VALVE SPRING PROBLEM THAT I WOULD REPLACE EVERY VALVE SPRING ON THE ENTIRE ENGINE.  AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE AND A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS COULD SAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND LATER.
