WHEN THE HIGHBEAMS ONLY WERE ON I COULDN'T SEE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND WITH LOWBEAMS ONLY, I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING DISTANT. I DID FIND OUT THAT I COULD HOLD THE HIGHBEAM FLASHER IN THE UP POSSITION AND KEEP BOTH BEAMS ON WHICH ISN'T TOO SAFE DRIVING WITH ONE HAND. THIS CAN ONLY BE CALLED A VERY STUPID PIECE OF ENGINEERING.  IT IS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT QUITE A FEW OF THE NEWER VEHICLES ARE BUILT THIS WAY.  IT IS A VERY REAL SAFETY HAZZARD WHEN DRIVING DARK ROADS AS I FOUND OUT.  I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLIGHTS AND WENT TO THE DEALER WHERE I FOUND OUT THAT THE CROWN VICTORIA IS ACTUALLY BUILT THAT WAY.
