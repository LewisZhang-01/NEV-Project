MAZDA NEVER REPLACED THE ENGINE WITH AN ENGINE THAT DID NOT HAVE COMPRESSION ISSUES.  THE DEALERS USED THE SAME ENGINE AND MAZDA WAITED FOR CONSUMERS TO EXCEED THE 100K MILEAGE AND THEN REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE.

I COULD FEEL MY LEFT FOOT WAS IN EXTREME PAIN. MY CAR WOULD NOT START. I FEARED THAT THE ENGINE HAD BLOWN UP. MY CAR IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED AND SERVICED REGULARLY WITH NO MODIFICATIONS. WHAT I DISCOVERED WAS THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD DETONATED, THE GEARBOX BELL HOUSING WAS TORN APART (GOT PICTURES TO PROVE IT) AND I FOUND PARTS OF THE CLUTCH IN MANY TINY PIECES ALL OVER THE ROADS.   THE CLUTCH WAS REPLACED BY MAZDA 30,000KMS AGO AND AT A MAZDA DEALERSHIP USING OEM CLUTCH KIT. THE FORCE OF THE GEARBOX EXPLOSION WAS SO GREAT THAT THE CLUTCH PEDAL IMPACTED MY LEFT FOOT AND SHATTERED THE BONES OF THE LEFT FOOT IN PIECES (YES I WAS WEARING THICK SOLED SNEAKERS) AND CAUSED SEVERE TRAUMA TO MY FOOT IN GENERAL.   AT THE HOSPITAL, THE SURGEONS WORDS WERE \" IT LOOKS REALLY BAD\". I WAS OPERATED ON AND TITANIUM PLATES AND 4 SCREWS WERE INSERTED TO TRY TO HOLD MY SHATTERED BONES IN PLACE.   8 MONTHS AND A LOT OF HOSPITAL VISITS LATER, I AM STILL RECOVERING FROM THE DAY. I HAD FURTHER SURGERY FEW WEEKS AGO TO PERFORM A BONE GRAFT BECAUSE ONE BREAK WASN'T HEALING.  I HAVE APPROACHED MAZDA REGIONAL HEAD OFFICE.

THE ENGINE WILL LOOSE COMPRESSION AND POWER IN TRAFFIC AND CAUSE A SAFETY ISSUE. I KEEP MY VEHICLES WELL PAST THE 100K MARK BECAUSE I TAKE CARE OF THEM AND KEEP THEM ON THE ROAD.  HOWEVER, THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE WITH THIS CAR, DUE TO A COMBINATION OF MAZDA'S BAD FAITH METHOD OF REPLACING FAULTY ENGINES, AND THE POTENTIALLY FATAL AIRBAG ISSUE. APPARENTLY THE CAR ALSO HAS ISSUES WITH THE EXHAUST OVERHEATING AND CAUSING A FIRE HAZARD, WHICH I HAVE NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED OF.  ALTHOUGH A BEAUTIFUL CAR THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE, THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE IN MORE THAN ONE WAY AND HAS A CURRENT VALUE OF $0. IM EVEN AFRAID TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE NOTICES I HAVE RECEIVED, THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WHEN OR WHAT MIGHT CAUSE THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY.  I REALLY CANNOT PUT A SPECIFIC DATE ON WHEN THE ISSUES OCCURRED, OTHER THAN THE SERVICE RECORDS FOR ENGINE REPLACEMENTS UP UNTIL THE 100K MARK.  AT 102K MAZDA REFUSED TO REPLACE ANOTHER ENGINE THAT HAD GONE OUT.",

THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT KEEPS GETTING WORSE    THE STEERING INDICATOR LIGHT IS ON AND THE ISSUE IS CONSTANT. WHETHER AT A STAND STILL, DRIVING, OR TURNING. THE WHEEL LITERALLY LOCKS UP AND REQUIRES YOU TO USE FORCE TO BRAKE IT FREE, WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY COUNTER ACT THE EXTREME BREAKING FORCE (ROTATIONAL) THAT YOU APPLIED SO YOU DON'T SIDE SWIPE ANOTHER CAR. (THIS IS NOT JUST FROM THE ELECTRICAL ASSIST NOT WORKING BUT THE RACK ITSELF) WHEN YOU DO COUNTER THE FORCE, NOW YOUR GOING THE OTHER WAY DEPENDING ON THE ORIGINAL FORCE. THIS CAN AND MAKES IT SEEM TO YOU AND OTHERS THAT YOU SNAPPING THE CAR, EXTREMELY QUICKLY IN YOUR LANE FOR NO REASON. BUT ALSO DUE TO THE FORCE AND SPEED MAKES THE CAR WANT TO BREAK TRACTION AND SPIN OUT.    ANOTHER INSTANCE IS WHERE YOU HAVE LITTLE (STILL MANUAL) FORCE ON THE WHEEL AND THEN THE TEETH OF THE GEAR SEEM TO JUMP OR BOUNCE FROM 1 TO THE OTHER WHICH LEADS TO A QUICK SWAYING OF THE CAR NOT QUITE SNAPPING.    AND FINALLY NOW AND RECENTLY THE ELECTRICAL ASSIST SEEMS TO BE KICKING IN AND ADDING MORE TURN TO THE WHEEL. SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE FIXED THE SWAYING FORCES THE ELECTRICAL ASSIST ADDS MORE FORCE AND IT THROWS YOU OFF ON HOW MUCH OR LESS FORCE YOU HAVE TO USE SO THAT YOU DON'T TAKE OUT ANOTHER VEHICLE    THESE KINDS OF THINGS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING AND NEED TO BE FIXED, SO THAT NO ONE GETS HURT.

I FINALLY FIGURED OUT THAT BP PREMIUM SEEMED TO KEEP IT FROM \"COUGHING\". I THOUGHT THAT I HAD FIXED THE ISSUES AND IT DROVE FINE FOR A GOOD WHILE. I CHANGED THE OIL RELIGIOUSLY AT ABOUT 3000 MILES OR LESS. IT WOULD DISPLAY THE OIL LIGHT AFTER ONLY ABOUT 1500-2000MILES. I HAD A DEALERSHIP LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAID THE OIL LEVEL WAS FINE AND THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAD THE LIGHT ON. THE OIL LIGHT NOW COMES ON AT JUST 300MILES INTO THE LAST OIL CHANGE. IN FEB OF THIS YEAR IS WHEN THE CAR STARTED DETERIORATING AT A RAPID PACE, AND I WAS COMPLETELY DUMBFOUNDED TILL I BEGAN DOING SOME RESEARCH AND SAW THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUES I HAVE HAD. FOR ONE- THE AC NEVER WORKS CORRECTLY. I HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE KNOB FOR A BIT TO MAKE IT COOL, AND STILL EVEN THEN IT DOES NOT WORK. I AM NOT ABLE TO DRIVE IT TO AND FROM THE STORE NOW BECAUSE I AM WORRIED IT WILL NOT START BACK UP. I ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE ENGINE IS WARMED UP AND SOMETIMES JUST LEAVE IT RUNNING INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CHANCE OF TURNING IT OFF. THE ENGINE LIGHT ALSO COMES ON AND RANDOM TIMES, AND I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE GAS CAP WAS NOT ON TIGHT ENOUGH. THAT IS A LIE, I ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO TIGHTEN IT, AND WHY WOULD THE ENGINE LIGHT COME ON AFTER THE OIL LIGHT EVERYTIME IF IT WAS HUMAN ERROR. THE CAR WHINES WHEN AT A STOPLIGHT OR SITTING FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME. IT SOUNDS AS IF IT IS COMING FROM THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE IF YOU ARE SITTING IN IT. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT NOISE IS EITHER. THIS FAULTY CAR SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE IT, I AM SCARED TO PUT MY FAMILY IN IT, AND I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE WAY MAZDA DECIDED TO TREAT ME WHEN I CALLED THEM TO INQUIRE ABOUT CERTAIN RECALLS.   *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR BEFORE IT RAN OFF THE ROAD - NO FAILURE WARNING LIGHT ON THE DASH. SINCE THEN THE FAILURE LIGHT HAS APPEARED IN INCREASING FREQUENCY TO THE POINT IT IS MOSTLY ON. WHEN THE WARNING LIGHT IS ON, THE STEERING IS ESSENTIALLY MANUAL, BUT WORKABLE. THE WORST CASE IS WHEN IT IS OFF, AND SUDDENLY GOES INTO A FAILURE MODE WITHOUT *ANY* INDICATION (I.E. THE WARNING LIGHT STAYS OFF). IT HAS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES, EVEN WHEN AT A FULL STOP AND THE WHEEL TURNS BY ITSELF TO THE RIGHT. PRETTY DISCONCERTING.

MY RX-8, WHICH WAS JUST AT THE DEALER 2 WEEKS AGO, HAD AN ENGINE MALFUNCTION WHILE I WAS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN MASSACHUSETTS. THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE WENT FROM APPROX 50MPH TO 10MPH IN A MATTER OF A FEW SECONDS. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE BREAKDOWN LANE WITHOUT INJURING MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE; HOWEVER, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. EVERY SINGLE PART IN MY RX-8 HAS BEEN REPLACED EXCEPT FOR THE ENGINE MOUNTS AND ENGINE. I HAVE DISHED OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ALREADY AND THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 44,000 MILES ON IT. NOT ONLY IS THIS A SAFETY HAZARD TO THOSE OF US DRIVING THE VEHICLE, BUT IT IS ALSO A SAFETY HAZARD TO THOSE AROUND US. HAD THE CAR BEHIND ME NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION MY VEHICLE COULD HAVE CAUSED A DEADLY CAR CRASH IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSH HOUR ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY. I HAVE CONTACTED NUMEROUS DEALERSHIPS, THE BBB, AND AM NOW LOOKING INTO A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. MAZDA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE MY CAR WAS PURCHASED IN 2003, BBB WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE, HOWEVER I HAVE 57 PAGES OF DETAILED REPAIRS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THIS VEHICLE SINCE I OWNED IT, WHICH I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO SEND TO YOU.

AFTER PARKING THE CAR AND LETTING IT COOL FOR SEVERAL HOURS, THE CLUTCH PEDAL RETURNED TO NORMAL.          THE SYMPTOMS WERE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN MAZDA TSB # 05-004/06 'MANUAL TRANSMISSION - CLUTCH HARD TO DISENGAGE'.        THIS TSB DESCRIBES A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WHERE ETHANOL USED IN THE CLUTCH RELEASE CYLINDER BOOT CAN VAPORIZE AND INCREASE PRESSURE WITHIN THE BOOT, WHICH THEN CAUSES THE PISTON TO BE PUSHED BACK INTO THE RELEASE CYLINDER BODY. AS A RESULT, A GAP APPEARS BETWEEN THE PISTON AND THE PUSH ROD, RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE FREE PLAY AND THE CLUTCH HARD TO DISENGAGE.  THE TSB SAYS THAT THE ETHANOL CAN VAPORIZE 'AT HOT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES OR APPROX. 85 F.'  THIS IS SURPRISING, BECAUSE, 85 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IS A VERY NORMAL TEMPERATURE.         ADDITIONALLY, THE TSB SAYS THAT A MASS PRODUCTION CHANGE WAS MADE SINCE WE BOUGHT OUR CAR AND THAT ETHANOL IS NO LONGER USED DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THE CLUTCH RELEASE CYLINDER ASSEMBLY.  THE TSB RECOMMENDS REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PART.        THIS SITUATION IS OBVIOUSLY VERY DANGEROUS.  WHEN THE CLUTCH BECOMES HARD TO DISENGAGE, THE CAR CAN'T BE DRIVEN SAFELY.  WE LIVE IN A CROWDED, URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND MUST BE ABLE TO CHANGE GEARS OR PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL VERY QUICKLY.        3.

THE PIPE THAT TRANSPORTS OIL FROM THE ENGINE TO THE COOLER AND BACK IS EXPOSED AND SUBJECT TO CORROSION FROM ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, IN PARTICULAR THE ALUMINUM REINFORCING MATERIAL IN THE PIPE IS VULNERABLE TO ROAD SALT.     THIS PROBLEM IS KNOWN TO MAZDA. IN CANADA THEY HAVE ISSUED FIELD ACTION NUMBER 142-36, WHICH IS A RECALL IN WHICH THEY REPLACE THESE PIPES WITH A REDESIGNED PART THAT IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS DEFECT. THEY HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO EXTEND THIS RECALL TO THE US BECAUSE (QUOTING FROM THE RECALL DOCUMENT):    \"THE MAZDA RX-8 IS SOLD IN THE U.S., HOWEVER THROUGH REVIEW OF FIELD REPORTS AND WARRANTY CLAIMS WHERE ROAD SALT IS USED, THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THIS CONDITION IN THE U.S. MAZDA HAS CONCLUDED THAT NO FIELD ACTION IS REQUIRED IN THE U.S. MARKET AT THIS TIME.\"    THE REASON I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT IN MY CASE, THE PIPE PERFORATED WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION, SPRAYING A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENGINE OIL AT HIGH PRESSURE INTO THE INTERNAL ENGINE COMPARTMENT, AND ONTO THE ROAD BEHIND ME. HAD I NOT KILLED THE IGNITION ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, I BELIEVE THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE VOIDED ALL OF ITS OIL ONTO THE ROAD. I BELIEVE THIS EXPOSED THOSE DRIVING BEHIND ME TO HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS, AND COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT (ALTHOUGH NONE OCCURRED IN THIS CASE). AGAIN QUOTING FROM THE CANADIAN RECALL DOCUMENT:    \"THE SMALL AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL OIL SEEPAGE WILL BE EVIDENCED TO THE CUSTOMER WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED AND IS NOT BELIEVED TO PRESENT ANY RISK TO SAFETY.\"    CLEARLY I DO NOT AGREE WITH THEIR ASSESSMENT HERE! *TR",

I HAVE BEEN LUCKY AND HAVE GOTTEN SAFELY OUT OF TRAFFIC, BUT THE WHEEL IS VERY HARD TO TURN, ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS. I'M OFFICIALLY FILING A COMPLAINT B/C IT SEEMS TO BE A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, AND I WANT THIS ISSUE RESOLVED. I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE MAZDA BUY BACK THE CAR FROM ME, SINCE, AT THIS POINT, I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN MY CAR, ESPECIALLY TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES. BUT IF MAZDA CAN REPAIR THE PROBLEM FOR GOOD, I'LL BE SATISFIED. THANK YOU. *TR",

WHAT DOES MAZDA DO TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM, THEY SENT OUT A DVD, THAT TELLS YOU HOW TO START THE CAR WHEN IT STOPS. WHILE, I WAS IN DALLAS, I MET PEOPLE ON LINE THAT ALSO HAVE THESE MAZDA RX8'S. THEY TOO ARE DISGUSTED. THIS CAR IS VERY UNSAFE, AND WILL STOP ON YOU AT THE DROP OF A HAT. MAZDA HAS BEEN SECRETLY REPLACING ENGINES, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WARRANTY IS NOW AT 100,000 MILES. NOW THE CATCH: YOU TAKE THE CAR IN AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY ENDS UP COSTING YOU MONEY. I HAVE 70,000 MILES ON MY 2004 RX8, AND IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. I HAVE ALSO TALKED TO PEOPLE, THAT ARE UPSIDE DOWN, AND THEN OTHER DEALERS ARE AWARE OF THIS CRAP OF A CAR. I HAVE CONTACTED YOUR AGENCY ONCE BEFORE, AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE, MY NEXT COURSE OF ACTION IS A COMPLAINT WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. ALL I NEED IS A EMAIL ADDRESS FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR AGENCY, AND I WILL HAVE MANY STORIES. TODAY, MY CAR STOPPED JUST AS I CROSSED LAKE TRAVIS, AND AGAIN AS I ATTEMPTED TO CLIME A HILL. WE RX8 OWNERS NEED HELP. YOU PEOPLE ONLY REACT ONLY AFTER SOMEONE HAS DIED. IT IS OBVIOUS THERE IS A PROBLEM. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS, AND MAZDA IS DOING NOTHING.

CAR FLOODED, DE-FLOODED CAR AS PER BULLETIN #01-048/06XXB479R1//.3 ? PROCEDURE ?A? ONLY.    AFTER BELIEVING THIS PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED, I ASSUMED EVERYTHING WAS OK.  TO NO AVAIL, ON APRIL  4, 2008, DUE TO AN EMERGENCY, ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE A SHORT DISTANCE.  AFTER PARKING VEHICLE AT HOME FOR 2 DAYS DURING A SHORT ILLNESS, I WENT TO START VEHICLE TO GO TO WORK VEHICLE WOULDN?T START.  ?DE-JAVU?!  I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND TRIED TO START VEHICLE AGAIN.  AFTER THAT, I HAD TO CALL OUT OF WORK ADVISING THEM OF CAR TROUBLE.  I THEN WAITED 4 HOURS TO TRY STARTING AGAIN, STILL NO START.  I CALLED THE CASTLE FORD/MAZDA IN BELTSVILLE WHO ADVISED ME TO TOW VEHICLE IN.  ONCE UNIT ARRIVED, AFTER ONE WEEK OF WAITING FOR RESULTS OF DIAGNOSIS, VEHICLE WAS FLOODED AGAIN.  THE DEALER GAVE ME AN INITIAL REPAIR ESTIMATE OF $850.00.  I WAS ABLE TO HAVE THEM LOWER THAT AMOUNT TO $650.00.  MY TRUST IN MAZDA?S PRODUCTS HAS TRULY BEEN TARNISHED.  *TR",

I HAD ADVISED THEM THAT I HAD READ ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH THE CLUTCH BRACKET, AND THE CLUTCH PEDAL ALIGNMENT.  I QUESTIONED WHETHER I HAD TOO MUCH FREE PLAY, AND NOT ENOUGH CLUTCH STROKE. THEY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR THE DAY AND ADVISED ME BY PHONE THAT THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  MY CLUTCH PEDAL ALIGNMENT WAS OFF AND THEY MADE ADJUSTMENTS.

THERE IS ALSO AN ANNOYING FEATURE ON THE DEFROSTER.  YOU CANNOT DEFROST THE WINDOW WITH INSIDE AIR AS SOON AS YOU TURN ON THE DEFROSTER IT FLIPS THE OUTSIDE AIR VENT OPEN.  SO WHEN IT IS VERY COLD YOU HAVE TO CHOSE BETWEEN SEEING OUT THE WIND SHIELD AND FREEZING OR HEAT THE CABIN AND THE WIND SHIELD FOGS UP.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN THREE TIMES AND HAVE SINCE GAVE UP.  THE TECH'S OBVIOUSLY CANNOT OR WILL NOT FIX IT.  THE TECH ACTUALLY HAD A THERMOMETER IN THE VENT OF THE CAR AND OF COURSE THE CAR IS INSIDE THE GARAGE IN THE SHADE.  SO HE POPS IN THE THERMOMETER AND COMES BACK AND CHECKS IT A - OK.  I GAVE THEM A DETAILED DESCRIPTION, DO YOU THINK THEY TOOK THE CAR OUT AND DROVE IT WHEN IT IS ABOVE 85 DEGREES OUTSIDE?

EACH TIME I NARROWLY AVOIDED BEING REAR-ENDED BY TRAFFIC BEHIND ME.  THIS VISIT LASTED 10 DAYS.      ON 6/12/06, MY CAR BEGAN IDLING VERY ROUGHLY AND DIED 4 TIMES.  AGAIN I NARROWLY AVOIDED BEING HIT BY TRAFFIC.   ON 6/13/06, I TOOK MY CAR FOR SERVICE, WHERE IT REMAINS, AS OF 6/16/06.    ON THIS SITE FOR 2004 RX-8'S ALONE, THERE ARE 9 OTHER COMPLAINTS LIKE MINE.     WHEN I DRIVE MY CAR, I CONSTANTLY FEAR THE NEXT INSTANCE WHEN THE CAR WILL DIE.  FORTUNATELY, I HAVE ESCAPED SERIOUS INJURY AND SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THIS POINT.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN THAT SHOULD THIS PROBLEM CONTINUE, AS IT SURELY WILL, THAT I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO BE SO FORTUNATE.  DESPITE ALL MY COMPLAINTS MAZDA CONTINUES TO DO NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM.  THEY NEED TO BUY BACK MY VEHICLE, AS IT IS QUITE OBVIOUSLY IRREPARABLE.  *NM",

JOHN CALLED ME FRIDAY STATING THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE CLUTCH, BEARINGS, FLYWHEEL, & THAT MY TRANSMISSION WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, SO COST WOULD BE PASSED TO ME. $1300.00.

I CONTACTED MAZDA USA- I WENT THROUGH THE MOTIONS, THINKING THAT THEY WOULD COVER IT AS THE PROBLEM WAS OBVIOUS & RELATED TO A RECENT RECALL INVOLVING THERMAL DAMAGE.  I GOT THE CALL FROM JOHN. HE STATED THE FACTORY REP CLAIMED IT AS \"NORMAL WEAR\" & MAZDA WOULD NOT COVER IT. I TOLD JOHN THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT UP 6 MONTHS AGO. HE STATED MAZDA HAD MADE ITS DECISION.

MANY PEOPLE ONLINE I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM AND THE SERVICE PERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP STATED, ''WE SEE CARS IN HERE FOR THIS ALL THE TIME''. THE TOTAL REPAIR COST IS OVER 800$.

MAZDA SUDDENLY DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE OIL PUMP - SPECIFICALLY \"CODE P209 POST CATALYST FUEL PUMP TRIM TOO LEAN.\"  THIS CODE HAS COME UP ON THE DIAGNOSTIC PREVIOUSLY, WITHOUT REPAIR.  THE CAR IS NOW JUST OVER 50,000 MILES AND THEREFORE, MAZDA REFUSES TO HONOR THE WARRANTY - DESPITE THE ON-GOING NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE MAZDA HAS ACTED FRAUDULENTLY IN THIS MANNER.  THEY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM SINCE NEAR THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE DATE, FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, AND WHEN OUT OF WARRANTY, SUDDENLY ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND REFUSE TO PAY.  IN ADDITION, I WAS INFORMED BY MAZDA THAT THE FUEL PUMP WHICH IS NEEDED TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM IS ON BACKORDER WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND UNAVAILABLE.  I HAVE TO WONDER IF THE DEMAND IS EXCEEDING THE SUPPLY OF THIS PARTICULAR FUEL PUMP BECAUSE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF RX8 OWNERS ARE ALSO BEING AFFECTED BY THE SAME PROBLEM.  *NM",

IT IS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CHILD TO LATCH THEMSELVES IN.  NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ATTACHING INFANT OR CHILD SEATS WITH SEAT BELTS INSTALLED IN THE SEAT ITSELF - IT'S A PROBLEM FOR OLDER CHILDREN (30-80 LBS) THAT SIT IN A BOOSTER AND USE THE 3 POINT SEAT BELT INSTALLED IN THE CAR.  I HAVE CONTACTED MAZDA AND RECOMMENDED THAT THEY CREATE A SEAT BELT EXTENDER SO THAT THE BELT LATCH CAN BE RAISED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO REACH AROUND THE SIDE OF THE CAR SEAT, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE, BUT THERE WAS NO REMEDY IN THE FORSEEN FUTURE.  I HAVE ALSO SHOPPED AROUND FOR BOOSTER SEATS, AND HAVE YET TO FIND A MODEL THAT WORKS IN THIS CAR.*AK",
