IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST - HAD NO BRAKES WHATSOEVER. AS WENT UP OVER CURB, I DEPRESSED EMERGENCY BRAKE.  WITH ONLY THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, SLOWLY ALLOWED TRUCK TO ROLL BACK DOWN OVER CURB.

I AM AFRAID THAT MANY OF THOSE VEHICLE OWNERS HAVE NOT YET NOTICED THAT THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TRUCK FRAME FAILURE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RUST PROBLEM EXHIBITED BY THESE VEHICLES. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THESE STRUCTURAL COMPONENT AND BRAKE LINE FAILURES WILL RESULT IN MANY VEHICLE CRASHES AND THE UNSUSPECTING VEHICLE OWNERS HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS WILL INEVITABLY HAPPEN UNLESS THE NHTSA STEPS IN AND FORCES AN INVESTIGATION AND RECALL OF 1999 THROUGH 2006 CHEVY SILVERADO VEHICLES.  *TR",

I HAD NO BRAKE PRESSURE AND WAS UNABLE TO STOP AT THE STOP SIGN. LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL, PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND PUT ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ONCE THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP. AFTER INSPECTING THE TRUCK, I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE BRAKE LINES HAD RUPTURED DUE TO SEVERE CORROSION AND ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES ARE CORRODED AND WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE ENTIRE UNDERCARRIAGE INCLUDING THE FRAME, SUSPENSION, BRAKES, AND FUEL LINE HAVE EXTENSIVE CORROSION. THE EXTENT OF THE CORROSION IS VERY SURPRISING BECAUSE I LIVE IN CENTRAL VA AND WE DON'T EXPERIENCE SNOW OR SALT BEING APPLIED TO THE ROAD VERY OFTEN. ALSO I HAVE ONLY USED THE TRUCK TO DRIVE TO WORK WHICH CONSISTED OF MOSTLY INTERSTATE DRIVING. THIS APPEARS TO BE MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATE BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED DUE TO BRAKE FAILURE. *TR",

WHILE DRIVING THE TRUCK, SHE SAID THAT WHEN SHE APPLIED THE BRAKES, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALMOST TO THE FLOOR BEFORE THE TRUCK SLOWED, AND A WARNING LIGHT LIT ON THE DASH BOARD.  I WENT TO WHERE THE TRUCK WAS PARKED. I CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR. IT WAS LOW, SO I ADDED BRAKE FLUID. I THAN TRIED THE BRAKES, BY PUMPING THE PEDAL A COUPLE OF TIMES. I GOT OUT AND LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK, AND FOUND A PUDDLE OF BRAKE FLUID. LOOKING CAREFULLY, I COULD SEE THAT IT WASN'T LEAKING FROM ANY FITTING, SO IT HAD TO BE A BROKEN BRAKE LINE. THERE WAS A MONRO SHOP NEAR BY, SO I BROUGHT THE TRUCK THERE. AFTER LOOKING THE BRAKE LINES OVER, THEY FOUND THAT ONE RUPTURED DUE TO CORROSION, AND THE REMAINING LINES WERE BADLY CORRODED. I HAD ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES REPLACED AT A COST OF JUST OVER $1,000.  I HAVE OWNED VEHICLES IN CONNECTICUT SINCE 1975.

APRIL 2006 I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM GM, IT STATED THE FOLLOWING:  1. YOUR 1999 MODEL YEAR CHEVROLET SILVERADO, IS INVOLVED IN A SAFETY RECALL 06019. 2.  SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR CHEVROLET DEALER. 3.  THIS SERVICE WILL BE PERFORMED FOR YOU AT NO CHARGE.  I DO NOT RECALL THE SPECIFIC DATES BUT I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY LOCAL DEALER WILSON CHEVROLET, STILLWATER OK, I CALLED AND MADE THE APPOINTMENT ON MONDAY AND SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT FOR THAT WEDNESDAY.  THAT WEDNESDAY I ARRIVED AT 8:00 AM ON TIME AT WILSON CHEVROLET. I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE GENTLEMEN AT THE DESK AND HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT I HAD HAVE TO LEAVE MY VEHICLE. THEY DID NOT OFFER TO GIVE ME A RIDE TO WORK OR ANYTHING, SIMPLY STATING I COULD RESCHEDULE. RESCHEDULE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION DUE TO I HAD ALREADY TAKEN A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM WORK AND THE DEALERSHIP WAS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF TOWN; IT WAS A 30 MINUTE DRIVE ROUND TRIP FROM MY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.  CONSIDERING MY OPTIONS I REMEMBERED THAT IN THE MAILING GM HAD PROVIDED A REIMBURSEMENT FORM. I OPT TO PURCHASE THE CABLES FROM THE DEALER AND REPLACE THEM MYSELF AND FILE A REIMBURSEMENT WITH GM.  I ISSUED A REIMBURSEMENT TO GM USING THEIR FORM, I ASKED FOR A REIMBURSEMENT OF $44.44, THE COST OF THE CABLES INCLUDING TAX. ON OCTOBER 16, 2006, A FEW MONTHS LATER AFTER SUBMITTING THE REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST I RECEIVED A DENIAL LETTER DENYING REIMBURSEMENT, NO REASON WAS GIVEN.  I ASK NTHSA TO LOOK INTO THESE CLAIMS AS I AM NOT AWARE OF MY RIGHTS TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT ON A RECALL THAT GM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  *JB",

IS NOW ESTIMATED TO COST ANOTHER $1500.00.  WE WILL BE ASKING FOR THE OLD FUEL LINE AS PROOF OF THE RUST THAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. *JB",

TO MY SURPRISE, HE SAID THAT FIXING THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR WOULD NOT FIX THE ABS PROBLEM I WAS HAVING. HE SAID THIS WITHOUT ANY DETAILS AS TO WHY I PULLED THE FUSE. HE SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE ABS MOTOR. HE SAID THAT THE CIRCUIT PACKS WITHIN THE MOTOR ARE SHORTED AND THE MOTOR WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. IT SEEMED LIKE HE HAS SEEN THIS PROBLEM MANY TIMES BEFORE. EVEN SEEMED ANNOYED WHEN I ASKED FURTHER ABOUT IT. I GOT THE FEELING THAT HE HAS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. EVERYONE I KNOW WITH THIS SAME VEHICLE IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. THE MECHANIC I USE TO GO TO TOLD ME THAT HE SEES THIS PROBLEM ALL THE TIME ON CHEVY'S AND GMS FROM AROUND 1999. HE OWNS A 2000 GM SIERRA AND IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. GM PUT OUT A RECALL FOR THE ABS, BUT ARE NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY. CHEVY DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WOULD COST ABOUT $800.00 TO REPLACE THE MOTOR. I FEEL LIKE GM TOOK THE CHEAP WAY OUT BY FIXING THE WHEEL SPEED CENSOR. IS EVERYONE ELSE WITH THIS PROBLEM BEING FOOLED THINKING THAT THEIR ABS PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE FIXED WITH THIS RECALL THAT IS CURRENTLY OUT?

THE ROADS WERE NOT WET OR SLIPPERY AND I ALMOST WENT INTO TRAFFIC SEVERAL TIMES (I HAVE ALSO ALMOST HIT A PARKED CAR PULLING IN A PARKING SPACE,  AND ALMOST WENT OVER A STEEP EMBANKMENT SINCE THEN).

THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CRUISE ANY LONGER.  I FINALLY DECIDED I HAD TO GET IT FIXED BECAUSE WE WANTED THE CRUISE FEATURE SO I GOT IT FIXED IN DECEMBER OF 2004.  BY THAT TIME, THE CHEVROLET DEALERS ARE FINDING OUT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THEY JUST NEED TO CLEAN OUT THE SENSOR WHICH NOW COSTS ABOUT $75 (THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE TRUCK FROM WOULDN'T EVEN ADMIT THERE WAS A PROBLEM).  THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GIVE ME PROBLEMS AGAIN AND I AM STILL A LITTLE AFRAID TO DRIVE MY TRUCK.

ON DECEMBER 24, 2002, OUR TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AT 103000 MILES. AS A RESULT, WE HAD TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION INSTALLED AT A COST OF $2,646.72 PLUS THE COST OF RENTING A VEHICLE. WE DRIVE ABOUT 25,000 MILES PER YEAR. WE DO NOT DO ANY TOWING, WE DO NOT USE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE EXCEPT IN THE WINTER, AND WE TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR VEHICLE. SINCE THIS INCIDENT, THIS TRANSMISSION WE HAD REPLACED HAS FAILED AGAIN, FORTUNATELY ABOUT 2000 PRIOR TO ITS 50000 MILE WARRANTY. I AM STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS HAPPENING. WE DO NOT ABUSE OUR VEHICLE AND WE DRIVE LIKE ANY REGULAR PERSON DOES. OH YES, POOR ENGINEERING. FURTHERMORE, ABOUT A YEAR AGO, WE HAD TO REPLACE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET ON OUR ENGINE WHICH COST US $700. NOT ONLY THAT, WHEN WE TOOK THE TAHOE TO HAVE THE 2ND TRANSMISSION FIXED, I ASKED IF OUR CRACKED DOOR HANDLE WAS THE RESULT OF A BREAK-IN. THE TECHNICIAN CHUCKLED AND SAID THAT  WAS COMMON. HE EVEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO BLAME IT ON THE CONSUMER FOR NOT USING THE DOOR HANDLE PROPERLY ACTUALLY SHOWING US HOW YOU HAD TO LIFT AND. SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS POOR ENGINEERING.  I EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO CONTACT SEVERAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS WHO UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT A TRANSMISSION ON THESE VEHICLES SHOULD LAST AT LEAST 200,000 IF NOT THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. I?M NOT SURE WHAT ANYONE ELSE EXPECTS FROM THEIR VEHICLES, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT A MAJOR COMPONENT, LIKE PART OF THE ENGINE, TO BLOW AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. I DID MAKE MY VOICE HEARD BY WRITING A LETTER FOR THE 1ST TRANSMISSION THEY PUT IN, BUT ALL THEY COULD OFFER ME WAS $1000 LOYALTY VOUCHER TOWARDS THE PURCHASE OF A NEW GMC PRODUCT. IF THEY CAN'T MAKE GOOD ON MY FIRST GMC VEHICLE, THEN WHY WOULD I BUY ANOTHER?  IN CLOSING, I NEED TO MAKE MY VOICE HEARD SO PEOPLE DON'T BUY GM PRODUCTS.*AK",

BOTH MY CHILDREN WERE IN THE REAR SEAT, A 7MONTH OLD FACING THE WINDOW AND A 3 YEAR OLD FACING FORWARD. I STOPPED IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE SURE NO GLASS WAS ON THEM.

I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE INSTALLER AT THE CELLULAR CO. IF THE ANTENNA WOULD AFFECT MY DEFROSTER AND HE SAID NO.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE ANTENNA YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DEFROSTER HAD BURNED THE TWO SIDED TAPE ON THE ANTENNA.  IT MUST HAVE GOT HOT ENOUGH TO BUST THE GLASS.  IT HAD THE SAME BURNT SMELL AS WAS IN THE VEHICLE.  A CALL TO GM CUSTOMER SERVICE ON 10/1/01 WAS MADE.  GLASS COULD HAVE EASILY LANDED IN ONE OF MY CHILD'S EYES.

I CONSIDER THIS ABNORMALITY TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT IN THE STEERING SYSTEM OF THE VEHICLE. TO DATE, THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO PARKWAY CHEVROLET IN DEER PARK, WA ON FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS IN ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE THIS PROBEM. THUS FAR THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED. THE FINAL ROAD TEST THE DEALER SERVICE SHOP FOREMAN DEMONSTRATED THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROBLEM. THIS FACT IS DOCUMENTED ON THE LAST SERVICE REPAIR ORDER. THE SHOP FOREMAN AND THE SERVICE MANAGER, KELLY CONNELLY, INFORMED ME THAT THE GM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PEOPLE CONSIDERS THIS ABNORMALITY AS \"NORMAL\" AS THEY HAVE PERFORMED THEIR PRESCRIBED TESTS, THE RESULTS SHOWING \"NORMAL\" CONDITIONS AND AFTER ALL, \"THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO ONLY OCCUR WHEN NOT ROLLING\"!  THEREFORE, THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT AUTHORIZE ANY FURTHER WARRANTY WORK. I CONTEND THAT GM NEEDS TO DEVELOP FURTHER TESTS TO ISOLATE THE SOURCE OF THIS PROBLEM WHICH ONLY BEGAN OCCURING AFTER APPROXIMATELY 30,000 MILES OF DRIVING. I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF DRIVING A VEHICLE WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED A PROBLEM IN THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED POWER STEERING SYSTEM. AT THIS POINT, CHEVROLET SEEMS TO KNOW THAT A PROBLEM EXISTS BUT ARE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER WARRANTY WORK ON MY VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THAT THE NHTSA SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THIS SAFETY DEFECT. CHEVROLET IS APPARENTLY UNWILLING TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION OR REPAIR TO THE PROBLEM. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.
