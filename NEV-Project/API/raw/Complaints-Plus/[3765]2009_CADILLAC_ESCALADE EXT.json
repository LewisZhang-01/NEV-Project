It is very dangerous and has caused my family to jerk and sometimes be hit in the process. It has died on the highway and creates an extreme possibility for accident to others, if this continues to occur. I typically would not reach out in this manner and I would just replace the vehicle, but through further research, others have also had this problem, reported it on the Cadillac forum and we have not been added to the previous electrical recall or gotten resolutions.
