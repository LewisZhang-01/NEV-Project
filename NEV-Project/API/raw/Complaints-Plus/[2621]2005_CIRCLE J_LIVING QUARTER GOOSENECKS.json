THE DIVIDERS THAT SEPARATE THE STALLS FOR THE HORSES AND THE  LATCHES ARE MADE OF A PLASTIC MATERIAL.  WHEN PRESSURE IS APPLIED THESE DIVIDERS CAN BE FORCED OPEN AND THIS ALLOWS THE HORSES WITH A SWINGING STALL GATE DIVIDER TO BE  LOOSE. THE HARDWARE HOWEVER IS METAL BUT THIS WAS PULLED RIGHT OFF THE STALL HOUSING WALL. THERE WAS ONLY ONE HORSE IN THE TRAILER WHEN THIS OCCURRED, AND THE HORSE SUFFERED A MODERATE INJURY.  HAS NOT BEEN TO THE DEALER, BUT PLANNED TO.  NO CORRECTIONS AT THIS TIME.  THIS TRAILER IS USED FOR BOTH SHOW AND PLEASURE PURPOSES.  THIS IS A 2005 YEAR MODEL HORSE TRAILER.  *AK",
