Additionally, this leak causes the AC system to stop cooling, thus making the inside of the vehicle a very dangerous place, particularly during summer months, as it is impossible to cool. There are thousands of reports of this issue on all Chevy/GM models between 2015-2020 including tahoe, silverado, suburban, and yukons. The manufacturer has put out a \"special coverage 17336\" adjustment but it only covers the vehicles up to 60,000 miles and because it's not part of a recall it's not automatically sent out to the owners of the vehicles. Further, a large number of vehicles are well beyond the 60,000 mile limit in the special coverage before the owner ever learns of the issue.  According to SAE J1739, \"Manufacturers must conduct Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) as provided in SAE J1739 (adopted 2009). Manufacturers must keep the FMEA on file for at least three years from the date of creation.\" I would challenge that chevrolet did not do this FMEA testing or did not do it per standard as it would have shown this issue. Instead they moved forward with production affecting hundreds of thousands of their most popular vehicles from 2015-2020 and resulting in the consumer having to pay an average of $1100 in repair costs due to a known defect from the manufacturer.",

THIS IS ALSO THE SAME PROBLEM AS OUR PREVIOUS CHEVY TAHOE SO WE KNEW THE PROBLEM WAS LIKELY RELATED TO POOR QUALITY BATTERY CABLES THAT ARE DEGRADING PREMATURELY. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING ON A 3-4 YEAR OLD VEHICLE. AFTER SEARCHING A GM WEB FORUM AND FINDING OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE, THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO GM TSB 18-NA-161 ON THIS EXACT ISSUE I AM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED THAT GM HAS NOT DONE A RECALL ON THIS YET, AS IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY FAILURE LIKELY TO CAUSE A CRASH AND POTENTIALLY A FATALITY. I CHECKED THE TIGHTNESS ON THE CONNECTIONS BY HAND, WHICH WERE BOTH VERY TIGHT, THEN I RESEATED AND TORQUED THE BATTERY TERMINAL CONNECTION. I MEASURED THE RESISTANCE ACROSS THE POWER JUMPER, LUG TO LUG. THIS IS GM PART NUMBER 84494554, AND I MEASURED 0.3 OHMS ACROSS THIS LITTLE SECTION OF WIRE AT MULTIPLE POINTS ON THE LUGS. TRIMMING BACK THE INSULATION AND CONTINUING THE MEASURE, THE HIGHEST RESISTANCE APPEARS TO BE COMING FROM THE WIRE TO THE LUG CONNECTION AT THE FUSE BUS, AND NOT THE CRIMP CONNECTION AT THE BATTERY TERMINAL, AND NOT THE BOLTED CONNECTION TO THE BUS. THERE WERE SOME STRANDS BROKEN AT THIS CONNECTION. I MADE AND ADDED A TEMPORARY JUMPER OF THE SAME WIRE GAGE, AND THE RESISTANCE ACROSS THE SAME MEASURED POINTS DROPPED TO 0.0 OHMS. ABSOLUTELY A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE IF THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DIES WITHOUT WARNING. I CAN SEE THIS SAME ISSUE HAPPENING ONCE, I FORGAVE GM ONCE YEARS AGO, BUT WITH THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENING TO TWO DIFFERENT VEHICLES 8 MODEL YEARS APART, THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BUY GM PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE.",

THE CAR HAS HAD NUMEROUS KEY FOB ISSUES AND HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER WHO CANNOT FIND ISSUE.  THE CAR HAS ALSO HAD 142 HARD BRAKING EVENTS SINCE APRIL 2019 TO NOVEMBER 2019 ACCORDING TO ON STAR REPORTS.  THE TIRE SERVICE MONITOR KEEPS FLASHING THAT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH TIRES.  THE REAR WIPER WOULD NOT SHUT ITSELF OFF EVEN THOUGH BUTTON WAS IN OFF POSITION.  ALL OF THESE ISSUES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE REPAIRED AT THE CHEVY DEALER.  THIS CAR IS GOING BACK IN FOR SERVICE 11/18/19 FOR THESE ISSUES AGAIN.  NOT SURE WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE UNTIL AFTER THIS APPOINTMENT.  MY GUESS IS THAT IT IS SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY PROBLEM(S) BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE DEALER SAYS THEY CANNOT FIND ANY ISSUE(S) OR PROBLEM(S) UNTIL IT COMPLETELY SHUTS DOWN.  THESE EVENTS ARE ONGOING AND HAVE BEEN OCCURRING INTERMITTENTLY SINCE NOVEMBER 2018.  ALL I CAN PROVIDE IS PHOTOS OF THE DASHBOARD SHOWING WHAT IT RELATES TO ME UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION OF ENGINE SHUTTING OFF ONLY A PHOTO OF WHAT DASHBOARD SHOWED WHEN IT HAPPENED.",

THERE WERE 3 OR 4 CARS IN FRONT OF ME TO TURN LEFT.  LIGHT TURNED GREEN, EVERYONE PROCEEDED. THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME PASSED THE CROSS WALK AT THE INTERSECTION, SHE SLAMMED ON HER BRAKES AND DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED.  I SAW HER MAKING A SUDDEN STOP, I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE.  SINCE WE WEREN'T GOING VERY FAST, MY EXPECTATION WAS FOR MY CAR TO STOP.  I FOUND THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL SEEMED TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO PUSH.  INSTEAD THE HARDER I PRESSED ON THE BRAKE THE MORE I REALIZED I WAS ABOUT TO HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  AT THAT POINT I FELT LIKE I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES.  THINGS WERE HAPPENING SO FAST.  AFTER MY VEHICLE BUMPED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, I ASKED THE GIRL TO PULL OFF THE ROAD SO WE WOULDN'T BLOCK TRAFFIC.  I CALLED THE POLICE TO COME OUT TO TAKE A REPORT.  SHE STATED THAT HER VEHICLE ALREADY HAD A HOLE IN THE BUMPER SO MY VEHICLE DIDN'T DO MUCH DAMAGE TO HER CAR.  WE BOTH HAD OUR VEHICLES REPAIRED.  SOMETIME IN EARLY TO MID MAY I RECEIVED A GENERIC LETTER FROM GM (DATED APRIL 2019) DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A CONDITION WITH THE 2017 SUBURBAN MAY HAVE A CONDITION WHERE CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCED INCREASED BRAKE PEDAL EFFORT.  I CONTACT GM AFTER STUDYING UP ON THIS ISSUE AND FILED A COMPLAINT. I RECD A CASE #.  SOMETIME LATER HE CONTACTED  ME SAYING MY CASE HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER AREA.  NEVER HEARD FROM ANYONE  CALLED THEM ON JUNE 18.  WAITED FOR ANOTHER CALL. FINALLY HEARD CASE WAS BEING MOVED TO ANOTHER AREA AND WAS TOLD IT COULD TAKE 30 DAYS OR MORE.  I SUPPLIED ALL THEY ASKED FOR.  THEY SENT SOMEONE OUT TO RETRIEVE DATA. WAITED AND WAITED. AFTER MUCH EFFORT RECEIVED AN EMAIL SAYING THAT THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED 5 MONTHS AGO & THE CONDITION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT THAT TIME AND DECLINED TO ASSIST",
