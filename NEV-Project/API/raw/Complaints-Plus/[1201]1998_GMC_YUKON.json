NAPA WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM; STATING THAT GM CARS HAD A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE SOLDER CONNECTIONS BREAKING ON THE ELECTRONIC BOARD THAT CONTROLS THE WIPERS.

THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS RECURRING PROBLEM ON GM CARS.  SINCE I WAS WAITING, THEY REPAIRED THE VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY.  THE CIRCUIT BOARD WAS THE PROBLEM.  I DROPPED MY DAUGHTER'S VEHICLE AT HER SCHOOL AND RETURNED HOME.  I FEEL THAT THIS WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM IS A SAFETY ITEM IN THAT OCCURRENCE WHILE DRIVING IN HEAVY RAIN LIKELY WOULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.
