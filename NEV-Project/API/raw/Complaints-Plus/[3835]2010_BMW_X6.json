CENTER BMW DESCRIBED THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL EIGHT (8) FUEL INJECTORS AND SPARK PLUGS FOLLOWING AN ENGINE MALFUNCTION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. ALL WORK WAS DONE UNDER WARRANTY. ON THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 3, 2012, AFTER LEAVING AN AFTERNOON MOVIE WITH MY CHILDREN (THEY ARE 9 AND 12 YEARS OLD), I CAN BEST DESCRIBE THE EVENT AS A LOUD BANG WHILE GOING APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES PER HOUR IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE ENGINE MALFUNCTION LIGHT AND ACTUAL FLAMES COMING OUT FROM THE FRONT AND UNDER THE CAR ? THERE WAS NO DELAY WITH THE FLAMES, IT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY. MY FAMILY AND I IMMEDIATELY ATTEMPTED TO GET OUT OF THE CAR, HOWEVER, THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN AND I HAD TO DRAG MY DAUGHTER OUT OF THE CAR OVER MYSELF AND FORCE MY DOOR OPEN WHILE BURNING MYSELF ON MY RIGHT HAND FROM THE FLAMES. THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND EXPLODED OVER THE NEXT 3-4 MINUTES. CENTER AND BMW N.A. HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE (EFFECTIVELY NOTHING) TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC CAUSE OF THE FIRE AND EXPLOSION NOR TO ALLAY ANY FEARS THAT MAY APPLY TO MYSELF OR THE SAFETY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC - INDEED, THEY WON'T EVEN AGREE TO AN INSPECTION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. MY REPEATED QUESTIONS TO BMW N.A. AND CENTER BMW HAVE BEEN - IS THIS LIMITED TO JUST MY CAR OR IS THIS SYSTEMIC ACROSS MANY LATE-MODEL HIGH PERFORMANCE BMW?S CONSISTENT WITH THE MANY RECENT RECALLS CONCERNING WATER AND OIL PUMP FAILURES.
