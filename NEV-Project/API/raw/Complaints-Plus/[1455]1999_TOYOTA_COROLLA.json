REFILLED RESERVOIR, AND AS SOON AS PEDAL WAS PRESSED, BRAKE FLUID SPRAYED OUT.  TOWED TO LOCAL GARAGE, WHERE MECHANIC SHOWED THAT THE REAR BRAKE LINE TO REAR BRAKES WAS SEVERELY RUSTED AND JUST RUPTURED UNDER PEDAL PRESSURE.  HE SPLICED ON A 1-2 FOOT SECTION WHERE THE RUST WAS WORST.  ON 6/03/2010, THE SAME HAPPENED ON THE OPPOSITE REAR BRAKE LINE IN OUR DRIVEWAY.  CAR WAS TOWED TO TOYOTA OF NEW BERN, NC. BY AAA, WITH A DETAILED NOTE TO REPLACE THAT RUPTURED LINE.  AFTER A $207.00 INFLATED BILL, THAT LINE WAS ALSO SPLICED, AND THE REPAIR INVOICE NOTED THAT ALL THE BRAKE LINES NEEDED REPLACEMENT FROM SEVERE RUST.    ASKED THE DEALERSHIP OWNER TO RECONSIDER THE 2 HOUR CHARGE OF $90.00 PER HOUR, BUT HE WAS OBSTINATE STATING HE HAD A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY HE HAD TO PAY FOR, AND WOULD NOT COMPROMISE WITH THE INITIAL $90.

THE REPAIR WORK ENABLED THE DOOR HANDLE TO FUNCTION MORE OR LESS NORMALLY, BUT THE MECHANICAL FEEL AND FUNCTION OF THE DOOR HANDLE WAS NOT THE SAME AS BEFORE, OR EVEN SIMILAR TO THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR HANDLE. I CAME IN ON OCTOBER 7TH TO HAVE THE HANDLE ADJUSTED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. THE MECHANISM WOULD EITHER STICK IN THE LOCKED POSITION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE OPENING THE WINDOW TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE (WHICH SOMETIMES DID NOT WORK EITHER); OR THE DOOR MECHANISM WOULD STICK IN THE OPEN POSITION, AND NOT ALLOW THE DOOR TO CLOSE PROPERLY. I CAME IN TWO MORE TIMES ON NOVEMBER 24TH, TO TRY TO ADJUST THE DOOR HANDLE. AFTER THE LAST TIME, I GOT TIRED OF GOING IN TO JUST BE TOLD ?IT IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM, AND WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT CAUSED IT, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING NOW?. THIS PROBLEM, I BELIEVE, IS A LATENT DEFECT IN THE DOOR LOCK CASTING OF THE HANDLE ASSEMBLY. NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS STATED ABOVE EXISTED PRIOR TO MY COMING TO TOYOTA OF ROSWELL FOR RECTIFICATION OF A LATENT DEFECT IN THE DOOR HANDLE ASSEMBLY. I NOW LIVE IN NEW YORK, AND THE DOOR CAUSES PROBLEMS DURING THE COLD WEATHER ? IT HAS SEIZED IN THE LOCKED AND UNLOCKED POSITION, WHICH WOULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN AN EMERGENCY. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR INTO THE TOYOTA OF HUNTINGTON, AND THEY SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE INTERNAL LOCK MECHANISM AND NOT THE HANDLE. BUT, THE HANDLE APPEARS TO HAVE A CRACK IN IT, AND I SUSPECT WILL BREAK SOON. *AK",

WHEN I TOOK THE CAR FOR ITS 40,000 MILE OIL CHANGE AND MAINTENANCE YESTERDAY (MAY 21, 2003) THE SERVICE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE STEERING RACK END, ALSO KNOWN AS THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS.  THIS IS PART OF THE SUSPENSION.  I TOOK IT TO TOYOTA OF CLEVELAND IN CLEVELAND, TN.  THE MAN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN WHICH STATED THAT THIS HAD BEEN A PROBLEM IN COROLLA'S.  HE SAID IT WAS NOT TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED A \"RECALL\" AND THAT APPARENTLY THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT CONSIDER IT ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM TO ISSUE A RECALL.  ALTHOUGH HE TOLD ME THAT IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN A LOT OF COROLLAS.  HE CLAIMED THAT IT WAS MERELY COSMETIC, THAT IT WOULD JUST MAKE NOISE, AND THAT IT DID NOT REALLY NEED TO BE FIXED.  HE SAID THEY WOULD FIX IT FOR FREE ONLY IF THE MANUFACTURER ISSUED A RECALL.  ALTHOUGH HE DID TELL ME THAT IF I WANTED TO FIX IT, IT WOULD COST ABOUT $600 TO HAVE IT FIXED.  I ASKED HIM IF THEY WERE GOING BAD AND HE SAID, \"OH, NO.  IF THEY WERE GOING BAD YOU WOULD KNOW IT.  THEY WOULD START RATTLING REALLY LOUD AND SHAKING.\"  SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT EVENTUALLY THEY WILL GO BAD AND THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY $600 OUT OF POCKET TO REPLACE THE STEERING RACK END ON A CAR THAT IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD AND SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE BRANDS?  IF THIS IS SUCH A PROBLEM, I THINK TOYOTA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL OF THIS PART AND FIX IT FOR FREE.*JB",

ON OUR WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP, WE NOTICED EXCESSIVE SMOKE FROM THE TAIL PIPE AND \"JERKY\" ACCELERATION.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD US THAT THE ENGINE WAS IN POOR CONDITION DUE TO SLUDGE DAMAGE AND EVEN ADMITTED THAT TOYOTA CO. HAS BEEN HAVING SLUDGE PROBLEMS IN TOYOTA ENGINES.  HOWEVER, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD US THAT TOYOTA MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY DOES NOT HONOR ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO SLUDGE DAMAGE.  THEIR ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR WAS $2500-$5800.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED THAT WE NOT DRIVE THE COROLLA ANYMORE THAN NECESSARY BEFORE WE HAVE THE ENGINE REPAIRED BECAUSE THEY SAID THE ENGINE MAY FAIL DUE TO THE SLUDGE.  WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ENGINE REPAIRED, BUT WE DID SEND AN OIL SAMPLE IN FOR OIL ANALYSIS.  ALTHOUGH THE OIL WE SENT IN ONLY HAD 314 MILES ON IT, THE LEVELS OF FUEL AND IRON IN THE OIL WERE CONSIDERED HIGH.  ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS AN OIL SAMPLE FROM A GASOLINE ENGINE SHOULD CONTAIN LESS THAN 2% FUEL, OUR SAMPLE WITH ONLY 314 MILES ON IT ALREADY HAD FUEL PERCENTAGE OF 2.8.  THE UNIVERSAL AVERAGE FOR IRON IS 9 PARTS PER MILLION, OUR OIL HAD 34 PARTS PER MILLION OF IRON.   IT SEEMS TO US THAT OUR COROLLA IS HAVING THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM AS THE MODELS THAT TOYOTA COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INCLUDE IN ITS PROGRAM IN WHICH CERTAIN ENGINE MODELS WITH SLUDGE DAMAGE CAN BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED BY TOYOTA AT NO COST.  AFTER VISITING SOME CAR REVIEW AND CAR SURVEY SITES AND PERFORMING SOME SEARCHES ON THE WEB, WE FOUND THAT WE WERE NOT THE ONLY COROLLA OWNERS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ENGINE SLUDGE.
