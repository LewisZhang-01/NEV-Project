My car has a plastic manifold. When a fuel injector or fuel regulator fails, raw gasoline can collect in the plastic bottom. If more than a few drops collects, turning over the engine can cause, and did in my car, a massive explosion. Fortunately the blue & white cloud of smoke that filled my two-car garage did not ignite. Had it ignited my son and I might not have survived and our home may have burned. Not that your organization takes all complaints seriously, particularly when thousands of cars might be involved, but these cheap plastic manifolds present a real danger I believe could have already caused deaths and property damage. If you are a political entity I suspect you will ignore this. But at least a warning should be give to the public. We are replacing the fractured manifold but the replacement part is still plastic, too thin to survive what cars in the past would have survived easily.",
