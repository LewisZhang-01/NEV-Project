THE FLOOR 8' IN FRONT OF THE REAR DROP DOWN DOOR HAS SUNK 6 INCHES OR MORE AND IS SO SOFT THAT IF PRESSURE IS APPLIED WOULD MAKE A HOLE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE GROUND. IN TERMS OF ATTEMPTING TO HAVE IT FIXED, THE SELLER HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND WILL NOT RETURN ANY CALLS, AS FOR ROADMASTER, THEY HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.  THIS TOY HAULER WAS PURCHASED IN MAY 2009 AND THEY FLOOR STARTED SINKING WITHIN ONE MONTH.  FOR A TEMPORARY FIX A 7'X8'X 1/4\" PIECE OF DIAMOND PLATE HAS BEEN PLACED OVER THE SOFTEST AREA.    ALSO, THE WATER TANK IS RESTING ON THE REAR AXEL OF THE TRAILER.  GIVEN ENOUGH PRESSURE AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FORCE, IT WILL EVENTUALLY FALL COMPLETELY OUT OF THE TRAILER. *TR",

BY THE TIME TRAILER WAS IN REGULAR USE BY END OF APRIL, IT WOULD NO LONGER LOCK AT ALL, AND PROBLEM GOT WORSE TO THE POINT OF THE HEAD RAIL OF THE TRAILER BENDING OUTWARD, WITH IT NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCK SAFELY.  WELDS HAVE POPPED AND STRUCTURAL DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED.  BRI MAR WANTS TO ADD ADDITIONAL BRACING, BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE PROBLEM, AND IT HAD OCCURRED BEFORE ON OTHER SIMILAR TRAILERS, DEREK FROM BRI MAR KNEW THE PROBLEM BEFORE I COULD EVEN FINISH TELLING HIM.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE TRAILERS.    I AM SEEKING A FULL REFUND, OR A BRAND NEW IDENTICAL TRAILER BUILT TO THE NEWER SPECS WITHOUT THE DAMAGE - WHICH THERE STILL MAY BE MORE UNKNOWN, DUE TO THE IMPROPER ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNIT.  ACCORDING TO DEREK AT BRI MAR MANUFACTURING, THEY NO LONGER BUILD THESE WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL BRACING, HE SAID I GOT A LEFTOVER FROM 2008, AND IT WASN'T ADDED TO IT, I SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT BACK BEFORE IT WAS SOLD TO ME OR ANYONE -FOR THE UPGRADES.    I HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY THE LOCAL POLICE AND THE INSPECTION STICKER WAS REMOVED.  I WAS TOLD TO HAVE THE TRAILER EITHER REPAIRED OR REPLACED AND REINSPECTED BEFORE IT CAN BE USED AGAIN.  I AM IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING ANOTHER FROM A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER.  IF THIS WAS JUST A BROKEN PART I WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH A REPAIR, HOWEVER, IT IS A STRUCTURAL DEFECT- WHICH INCLUDES MISSING PARTS, THIS IS WHY  I AM SEEKING A COMPLETELY NEW TRAILER OR A REFUND.    TECHNICALLY ANYTHING CAN BE FIXED, EVEN IN AUTOMOBILES.  IF THERE WAS A FRAME COMPONENT MISSING ON A VEHICLE, THE VEHICLE WOULD BE REPLACED, AS UNKNOWN ADDITIONAL DAMAGE COULD HAVE OCCURRED, FROM ADDITIONAL STRESSES PUT ON THE REMAINING UNIT. *TR",
