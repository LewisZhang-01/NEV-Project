Called local KIA Dealer, who told me this is a common problem with 2013 KIA Sportage and it would need a new engine at my expense. It was not included in engine recall.

We called the Kia dealership and asked what to do and were informed that our car was NOT listed under the Kia Sportage engine recall for knocking engines. We were told to add additive to our fuel and it would fix the issue. It didn't and the knocking got worse. Soon, it was so bad and the car was moving sluggishly along the road. There were NO warning lights. We had the car towed to a Kia dealership and were informed the engine was BLOWN, but we still have NO warning lights (no check engine light, no low oil light, no overheating light). We had ZERO indication (other than the noise) that there was a catastrophic issue with the engine. This is a car that we use to travel highways with and it put my life and my daughter's life in danger. The Kia dealership is asking us to pay $7000 in order to fix the issue - when it's a KNOWN issue with Kia Sportages.

At this time, I thought my engine was going to blow up while driving.  I was very frightened by this experience.  Then car shut off while I was driving putting myself and those behind me at rick of an accident, however I was able to pull over.  I was alone.  I had no idea what was happening and I was 75 miles from home.   There was no WARNING indicator light to come on in my dashboard to inform me that there was an engine problem.    After I steered my vehicle on the side of the road,  I was able to start the car to get to the nearest gas station for help.  There was no one available to help me.  So I decided to drive my vehicle slowly home. That is when my engine blew-up and I could no longer drive the vehicle.   I contacted KIA for Road Side assistance and they informed me the the tow would cost me near $560.00.   Then I called my mechanic friend for a tow.  After he arrived and looked at the engine, he looked over and under the engine and told me that a rod blew through the engine block.  (Pictures available) My 2013 Kia Sportage was brought to KIA of Duluth the following day for repair.  Kia of Duluth inspected the vehicle and informed me that a Knock Sensor Detection recall was not preformed on my vehicle and that my 100,000 mile Warranty had expired as I had 105,812 upon arrival.  On October 27, 2021 I submitted a Claim to Kia Engine Settlement and have received no satisfaction.  Further I was informed that I would be eligible for Towing and Rental Cost by Kia Consumer Affairs and KIA Engine  and most resent been denied that as well.   My 2013 Kia Sportage was valued at 10, 900 dollars when this happened on September 14th, 2021.   I received no reimbursement.  I have paid $2192.00 in towing and rental cost.

Our car has now been with KIA for nearly 8 weeks waiting to be repaired and they are now telling us that many of the old parts (Eg, Pistons) will be used when they rebuild the engine, verse replacing the entire engine.

HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF THE FREEWAY WHEN IT LOST POWER, MAKING IT INCREDIBLY UNSAFE AND PUTTING HIM IN DANGER BECAUSE THE PEOPLE BEHIND HIM HAD TO SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES TO AVOID REAR-ENDING HIM. IT WAS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS TO TRY AND MOVE THE CAR OFF OF THE FREEWAY WITH OTHER CARS GOING BY AT 50+ MPH. FORTUNATELY, HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR OFF THE FREEWAY AND PULLED OVER WHEREUPON THE CAR DIED. HE TRIED STARTING IT AGAIN AND IT STILL HAD THE VERY LOUD KNOCKING NOISE AND WOULD NOT STAY ON. ALL OF THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE DASH LIT UP AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON AFTER HE HAD TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON. AFTER WAITING FOR 3 HOURS FOR A TOW, THE CAR WAS FINALLY TOWED TO THE CLOSEST DEALER HILLTOP KIA IN RICHMOND CA. MY HUSBAND HAD TO WAIT FOR CLOSE TO A WEEK TO GET THE DEALER TO LOOK AT THE CAR AND ONCE THEY DID, THEY CAME BACK WITH AN $11,000 ESTIMATE STATING THAT THE CAR NEEDED THE ENGINE REPLACED, IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BECAUSE THE 100,000 MILE WARRANTY ONLY APPLIED TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER, THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS CAR AND KIA WOULD NOT REPLACE THE ENGINE FREE OF COST. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE ENGINE IN THIS CAR HAS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT AND THAT KIA IS NOT REPLACING THESE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW IT'S A DEFECT OF THEIR OWN MAKING. THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL BECAUSE THE CAR ONLY HAD 62,000 MILES ON IT, AND WE KEPT UP WITH ALL OF THE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE STILL OWE $3500 ON A CAR THAT WE CAN'T EVEN DRIVE, THE LOWEST WE'VE BEEN QUOTED TO GET IT RUNNING AGAIN IS $5000 WHICH MEANS THAT THE COST OF FIXING IT IS EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN THE RESALE VALUE OF THE CAR.",

BECAUSE MY VEHICLE IS USED TO TRANSPORT CHILDREN, MY HUSBAND ASKED ME TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP ASAP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. I MADE THE APPOINTMENT FOR 12/1. WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY TO GET TO MY APPOINTMENT THE SOUND PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE - THEN ALL LIGHTS WENT ON IN THE DASH AND THE GAS STOPPED WORKING. IT WAS LIKE MY VEHICLE WAS IN NEUTRAL WHEN I PRESSED THE GAS. IT WOULD NOT START AGAIN AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS LOCKED.  I WAITED OVER AN HOUR FOR A TOW TRUCK; ON THE SHOULDER OF A BUSY HIGHWAY, DURING RUSH HOUR. IT WAS DROPPED AT THE DEALER AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WAITING ON A REPORT AS TO WHATS WRONG. WE BELIEVE IT FALLS IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT RECALLS.",

I FOUND OUT THERE IS A RECALL #17V-224 (METAL DEBRIS MAY HAVE BEEN GENERATED FROM FACTORY MACHINING OPERATIONS AS PART OF THE MANUFACTURING OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE CRANKSHAFT'S OIL PASSAGES DURING THE CLEANING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THE MACHINING PROCESSES OF THE CRANKPINS CAUSED AN UNEVEN SURFACE ROUGHNESS. AS A RESULT, THE METAL DEBRIS AND UNEVEN SURFACE ROUGHNESS CAN RESTRICT OIL FLOW TO THE BEARINGS, THEREBY INCREASING BEARING TEMPERATURES CAUSING PREMATURE BEARING WEAR. A WORN CONNECTING ROD BEARING WILL PRODUCE A CYCLIC KNOCKING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE AND MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE ENGINE WARNING LAMP AND/OR OIL PRESSURE LAMP IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. IF THE WARNINGS ARE IGNORED AND THE VEHICLE IS CONTINUED THE CRANK SHAFT GOING OUT AND IT COULD START A FIRE.) THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR. I KNOW THE VIN # AND THE RECALL NUMBER DOES NOT MATCH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT I READ THAT THERE IS A RECALL BUT NOT FOR MY VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS 2011 TO 2013 KIA SPORTAGE. MY ENGINE HASS TO BE REBUILT THE PARTS ALONE ARE $2800 THEN IT COST THE MECHANIC TO FIX MY CAR SO IT'S GOING TO COST A LITTLE OVER OR UNDER 5000$ I ONLY OWE 4000$. IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN THIS I WOULD'VE TRADED MY CAR IN FOR THE NEW KIA SPORTAGE. I REALLY HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN GET A HOLD OF ME ABOUT THIS I DON'T SEE WHY I HAVE TO SPEND 5000 WHEN THERE WAS A RECALL ON EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE.",

EVEN THOUGH THERE IS AN ENGINE RECALL FOR 2013 KIA SPORTAGE VEHICLES WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM, THEY CLAIMED THAT MY CAR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. I AM NOW WAITING TO SEE IF THE WARRANTY COVERS THE DAMAGE. THEY WANT TO INSPECT THE ENGINE FIRST. TAKING THE ENGINE DOWN ALONE COSTS $1,000 IF THE WARRANTY REFUSES TO COVER THE REPAIRS. MY QUESTION IS: WHY ISN'T KIA REPAIRING ALL VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM?? WHY ISN'T MY VIN PAR OF THE RECALL?? WE COULD HAVE  LOST OUR LIVES THAT DAY, INCLUDING MY 3 MONTH OLD BABY. KIA MUST BE FORCED TO COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THESE FAULTY ENGINES BEFORE LIVES ARE LOST. US, KIA CUSTOMERS, SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO COVER THE COST OURSELVES. MY VEHICLE IS ONLY 75,000 MILES.",

        "summary": "WE EXPERIENCE AN INTERMITTENT RAW GASOLINE SMELL IN THE INTERIOR CABIN OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED A FEW WEEKS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE AND HAS PERSISTED EVER SINCE DESPITE 3 REPAIR ATTEMPTS AT KIA DEALERSHIPS (22AUG2012, 07JAN2013, 30JAN2013).  BECAUSE IT IS INTERMITTENT (OCCURRING ONCE OR TWICE EVERY COUPLE WEEKS) AND WITHOUT AN OBVIOUS PATTERN, THE DEALERSHIPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE SMELL ON THE DAYS WE'VE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN.  ON THE 3RD REPAIR VISIT (30JAN2013), THE TECHNICIAN WAS \"UNABLE TO VERIFY SMELL, BUT INSPECTED AND FOUND FUEL AROUND INTAKE AT THE FUEL INJECTOR BASES.\"  THEY REPLACED O-RINGS TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE ISSUE.  FOR A WEEK OR SO WE THOUGHT THE ISSUE WAS FIXED, BUT SINCE THE 3RD VISIT HAVE ON AT LEAST FOUR OCCASIONS NOTICED A PROMINENT RAW GASOLINE SMELL IN THE CABIN.  THE CLOSEST TO A PATTERN THAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THAT ON DAYS WHEN THE SMELL OCCURS, IT IS STRONGEST AND MOST OBVIOUS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IDLING WITH THE HEATER/AC FAN ON.  WE ALSO THINK, BUT ARE NOT SURE, THAT THERE MAY BE A CORRELATION WITH DAYS INVOLVING PRECIPITATION (SNOW/RAIN).  *TR",
