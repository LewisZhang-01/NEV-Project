IT APPEARS THE EXHAUST SYSTEM HAD MELTED THE INSULATION ON THE FLOORBOARD AND THE FIRE STARTED THERE. THE INSPECTOR WHO PERFORMED THE INITIAL INSPECTION AND INFORMED ME THAT THE FORD MOTORHOMES THAT YEAR AND THE NEXT WERE PROWN TO EXHAUST FIRES BECAUSE THEY HAD NO SECONDARY HEAT SHIELDS AROUND THE CONVERTER/MUFFLER, AND THAT THE LATER YEAR MODELS WERE EQUIPPED WITH THEM. CAN THIS BE TRUE? AND IS THERE ANY RECOURSE AGAINST THE MANUFACTURER? THANK YOU.  *AK",
