        "summary": "In the early summer of 2021, I started to hear a snapping noise in the driver\u2019s door.  I thought it might be the hinge, but it appeared to be coming from the middle of the door.  It got continually worse. When I put the window down it would come back up and catch my arm and then go back down.  Eventually I was only opening the door a short distance so it would not snap.  It made it very difficult to get in and out.  So, for over 3 months I squeezed in and out of the car. I am concerned about the other 3 doors.  In early September I contacted the dealer and was to take it on September 7th.  But the door became worse suddenly and I could barely get out and at one point I was stuck in the car.  I called the dealer immediately and asked to bring it to them that day.  After some hesitation and my explaining if I was trapped in the car during an accident, they would be hearing from me.  She said to bring it over immediately. The service manager, after inspecting the door, came out and asked me if I had been in an accident!  I suggested he look at the car and check it thoroughly.  It was obvious I had not been in an accident.  He stated they had never seen anything like that before.  They were taking pictures and I stated I wanted my own pictures. When I went into the shop and viewed the door, I was upset to find that all the welds on the bracket that holds the door check had failed.  The bracket was down inside the door panel.  Because it was catching it was making the snapping sound.  When the window hit it, it would automatically go back up.  They told me it would be necessary to contact Ford for more information and it would be a week or so before I heard anything.  At 8:08am the following day, not one week, they called back and said they needed to order a new door, have it painted and replaced. That is the last I heard about the door.  I have been in touch with Ford Corporate and discovered this is not the first time this has happened.  I do have a case# with Ford.",

The service advisor told me they had the battery on a testing device for a \"really long time\" and the low voltage issue never resolved.  The service advisor also told me that I need to drive the car more and to watch for error lights in the cluster.

Most recently, I recently experienced it on a hill where regenerative brakes would normally decelerate vehicle.  It felt like the brakes gave out in the middle of the hill.  Thankfully had no one in front of me so I was able to pump brakes and barely got vehicle to stop safely.  Then waited a few minutes - the brakes resumed normal operation.  Spoke with the dealer and they advised no knowledge of any such issue, and suggested I drop the car off so they could try to replicate the issue.  Not eager to have my wife drive the car, as this could lead to a serious accident.  Can clearly see from blogs and FB page on this vehicle that others have experienced the same - really thought I was alone on this.",

They couldn't put the unit in neutral so they could move it to the lift (first problem).

When he showed them to me, I realized that these orange connectors are positioned at the bottom of the vehicle, just 9 inches from the ground!  I explained that I had not entered any deep puddle, but this water was due to normal driving on rainy days, which splashes in a normal way from the tires and the vehicles on the sides. I said, my car should be able to drive on rain, as the rain is something natural and normal. My car is in diagnostic in the Ford agency.  They don\u2019t want to pay warranty because they said rain is a natural phenomenon.  This means that with puddle of water as small as 3 inches, water can get into these connectors, get wet, damage the hybrid battery, the unit and possibly cause an accident. If one day You encountered a slight 9-inch flood, it would be a sure breakdown!    Ford should review why they put these connectors on the bottom of the unit, without protection against water, without a hermetic seal and with the risk of breaking down the system and the car completely.

I couldn\u2019t start it, and the engine and battery lights were red.  The start button was flashing green.  I sat there, with traffic passing by, unable to start the car or turn it off, as it appeared it was in accessory mode.  I called Astoria Ford and talked to Greg, but it was Sunday, so no service available.  I was fixing to have it towed and was prepared to wait an hour for the tow truck.  After 20 minutes, a message popped up that said the car was going into a \u201cSystem off to save battery mode\u2026\u201d.  I was finally able to shut it off.  A couple minutes later, I was able to restart the car, and drove immediately to the Astoria Ford dealership.  The potential danger to this vehicle getting rear-ended seems great, and is a known issue with Ford now.  Since I\u2019ve owned the vehicle (a few months now), the car, when driving slowly down a hill and coming to a stop, will lurch and shudder, which leads me to believe that there could be some electrical and/or power train problems.
