THIS WAS THE SAME DAY I WAS TAKING MY CAR TO A LOCAL VOLVO DEALER FOR ITS 150,000 MILES SERVICE AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I WAS PLANNING TO REPORT WAS THAT THE CAR STALLS OCCASIONALLY WHEN I AM DRIVING OR JUST LOOSES SPEED. I HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST TWO YEARS TO AT LEAST THREE VOLVO DEALERS IN THE NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY METROPOLITAN AREA AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD IN ALL OCCASIONS THAT THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPLICATED WHEN CONDUCTING THE SERVICE.  THE STALLING PROBLEM BEGAN IN 2003 AND HAS HAPPENED 12 TIMES TO DATE. IN ONE OCCASION I WAS DRIVING AT 50 MILES AN HOUR IN A HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPEN. MY WIFE AND MY CHILD WERE IN THE CAR THEN. WE WERE ALL UNHARMED.  WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE VOLVO DEALER ON AUGUST 1, I GOT A CALL FOR THE SERVICE PERSON  AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE THROTTLE OF THE CAR HAD AN INTERNAL FAULT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR ALMOST $1,000. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE REASON WHY MY CAR WAS STALLING OR LOOSING SPEED. HOWEVER, KNOWING THAT THE CAR MODEL IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR A SIMILAR PROBLEM, I DECIDED NOT TO FIX IT UNTIL THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION IS KNOWN.

JUST RECENTLY THE AIRBAG SAFETY LIGHT (SRS) WENT OFF AND I WAS TOLD BY THE AUTHORIZED VOLVO SERVICE DEALER (RUSNAK, PASADENA) THAT IT MEANT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN THE AIRBAG SYSTEM AND  VOLVO WOULD REPLACE THE AIRBAG.  ON THE DAY OF THE REPAIR THE DEALER CALLED AND TOLD ME THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SEAT COVERS - THE COVERS WERE NOT AUTHORIZED VOLVO SEAT COVERS (DRIVER AND PASSENGER) AND THEREFORE THE VOLVO AIRBAG FEATURE MIGHT NOT WORK.  SINCE WE BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW FROM A VOLVO DEALER, WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SITUATION COULD HAPPEN.   VOLVO INFORMED US THAT DEALERS WILL SOMETIMES CHANGE FACTORY PARTS, IF THEY WANT TO, AND THAT VOLVO CAN NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEIR DEALERS DO.  SINCE THIS DEALER CHANGED A FEATURE THAT HAS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES, AGAIN WE COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS SITUATION IS CORRECT.  HOW IS A CONSUMER PROTECTED IN SUCH A MATTER?  WE BOUGHT FROM AN AUTHORIZED DEALER AND HOW ARE WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW OR EVEN SUSPECT THAT CRITICAL SAFETY ELEMENTS MIGHT NOT BE FUNCTIONING?  VOLVO AMERICA AND THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE, MICHAEL LAFATA, SEEM TO FEEL THAT IT IS JUST A CASE OF LET THE BUYER BEWARE.  THE VOLVO AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPERVISOR, KATHLEEN NATALE, WAS MORE UNDERSTANDING AND TRIED TO HELP BUT SHE HAD TO DEFER TO MR. LAFATA'S DECISION THAT VOLVO WOULD NOT REPLACE THESE SEAT COVERS TO RETURN THE AIRBAG SAFETY FEATURE TO AN OPERATING CONDITION. RATHER, RUSNAK VOLVO PUT MY CAR BACK TOGETHER WITH THE NON-VOLVO SEAT COVERS AND SENT ME ON MY WAY WITH A STACK OF PAPERWORK THAT CLEARLY SAYS THAT MY CAR MAY NOT BE SAFE BECAUSE THE AIRBAG FEATURE MAY NOT WORK WITH THE CURRENT SEAT COVERS.   AS YOU CAN SEE BELOW, NO ONE HAS BEEN INJURED OR DIED YET, BUT CLEARLY THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT WE BELIEVE VOLVO AMERICA SHOULD QUICKLY ADDRESS. *JB",

WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL IN THE \"OFF\" POSITION I CONTINUED DRIVING THROUGH THE CONGESTED AREA.  AS I WAS LEAVING THE CONGESTED AREA, I DECIDED THIS WOULD BE AN IDEAL TIME TO PUSH THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH INTO THE \"ON\" POSITION, IN PREPARATION FOR DRIVING AT THE HIGHER ALLOWED 65MPH SPEED LIMIT.  WHILE TRAVELLING AT 30MPH I PUSHED THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH INTO THE \"ON\" POSITION. AS THE CAR WAS NEW TO ME, I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR DETENT SIGNIFYING THE \"ON\" POSITION. UNKNOWNINGLY I 'OVERPUSHED' THE SWITCH FROM THE \"OFF\" POSITION, PASS THE \"ON\" POSITION, INTO THE \"RESUME\" POSITION (THINKING THAT THIS OUGHT TO BE THE \"ON\" POSITION).  I REMOVED MY FINGER FROM THE SWITCH AND IMMEDIATELY THE CAR BEGAN ACCELERATING (I LATER CAME TO REALIZE IT WAS ACCELERATING TO 65MPH, THE SETTING PRIOR TO THE SWITCH BEING TURNED OFF).  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT WHEN I PUSHED THE SWITCH INTO THE \"OFF\" POSITON, ALL PRIOR CRUISE CONTROL SETTINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERADICATED (AS IT DOES IN MY GM TRUCK AND PREVIOUS CARS I DROVE).  A DRIVER, AS I DID, NOT KNOWING THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL MEMORY DOES NOT CLEAR WHEN THE SWITCH IS PUSHED INTO THE \"OFF\" POSITION, COULD EXPERIENCE AN UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION AND A RESULTING COLLISION WHEN THE SWITCH IS PUSHED BEYOND THE \"ON\" POSITION.  AN INDIVIDUAL, AS I, HAVING DRIVEN A GM VEHICLE WITH FACTORY INSTALLED CRUISE CONTROL CONTROL IS USED TO HAVING THE \"OFF\" POSITION SEPARATING THE \"RESUME\" AND \"ON\" POSITIONS SO THAT THE OPERATOR MUST SELECT A DISTINCT, EXCLUSIVE MOTION FOR \"OFF\"  \"ON\"  AND \"RESUME\". *AK",
