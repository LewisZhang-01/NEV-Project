LUCKILY, I WENT STRAIGHT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC AND WHEN HE STARTED IT UP THE STEERING WHEEL HAD COMPLETELY LOCKED UP AND THE ERROR 'POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT' WAS DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAD EVER HAPPENED AND AFTER RUNNING THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST THE CODE B2278 INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL NHSTA # 14V282000 IN 2014 CAUSING THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING. THE MECHANIC CONTACTED THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALERSHIP TO CONFIRM IF THE RECALL HAD BEEN DONE. THE RECALL WAS ON THE STEERING TORQUE SENSOR WHICH AFFECTS THE ABILITY TO PROPERLY DETECT THE DRIVER STEERING INPUT. THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED THAT THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED IN 2014 AND MAZDA WAS NOT GOING TO REPLACE THE SENSOR AGAIN. I DECIDED TO DRIVE TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH WAS ANOTHER 30 MINUTES AWAY, BUT NOW THE STEERING WHEEL WAS LOCKING UP AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN THE WHEEL. SO AFTER THEY INSPECTED THE TRIBUTE I WAS TOLD THAT IT NEEDED THE TORQUE SENSOR REPLACED AND IT WOULD COST ME $877 AND IF THAT DIDN'T FIX IT THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE PART. SO THE TORQUE SENSOR DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE STEERING WHEEL IS SHAKING EVEN MORE UNCONTROLLABLY. NOW I HAVE ANOTHER $1500 I HAVE TO PAY AND TOTALING $2400.

AT ABOUT 3-WEEK INTERVALS, MY BRAKE PEDAL WOULD GO FARTHER DOWN TOWARD THE FLOORBOARD THAN IT USUALLY TAKES FOR ME TO STOP.  THIS USUALLY HAPPENED AT LOW SPEEDS (5MPH TO 40MPH), USUALLY WHEN I AM APPROACHING A STOPLIGHT OR STOP SIGN.  AFTER ALL OF THESE INSTANCES, WHENEVER I PARKED MY CAR AND STARTED A NEW TRIP, THE BRAKES WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL.  HOWEVER, ON 11/10/15, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WHEN I TRIED TO STOP AT 15-20MPH.  THIS WAS ON A BUSY CITY STREET, AND I HAD TO DRIVE UP ON THE MEDIAN TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I TOOK IT TO SEARS AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES; HOWEVER, THEY BLED THE BRAKE LINE, CHANGED THE BRAKE FLUID. THEN, I TOOK IT TO THE MAZDA DEALER AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES, BUT THAT THE FLUID NEEDED TO BE CHANGED.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO CARMAX, THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE MASTER CYLINDER, AND THEY REPLACED IT ALONG WITH THE FRONT ABS TONE RINGS.  ON 11/25/15, TWO DAYS AFTER GETTING MY CAR BACK FROM THE CARMAX MECHANICS, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS AGAIN FEELING LIKE IT WAS GOING FARTHER DOWN THAN NECESSARY, AND THEN IT WENT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN.  THAT TIME, I WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, SO IT WAS AT A LOW SPEED.  THE CAR IS NOW BACK AT CARMAX, AND THEY HAVE CALLED TO SAY THAT THEY CANNOT FIND ANY PROBLEM.  THE SCARIEST THINGS ABOUT THIS (BESIDES THE OBVIOUS FEAR THAT MY CAR WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT) ARE: 1) THE RANDOM NATURE OF THESE BRAKE PROBLEMS; 2) THE FACT THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL GOES BACK TO NORMAL AFTER ONE OF THESE EVENTS; 3) MECHANICS WERE NOT SPOTTING A PROBLEM WITH MY BRAKES; AND 4) WHEN A PROBLEM WAS SPECIFIED AND SUPPOSEDLY FIXED, THE BRAKES STILL WENT OUT.",

THEY TOLD ME $550 MIN. TO REPLACE.  I THEN DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH AND WENT TO THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALER.  THEY SAID IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT MAZDA HAD A PROGRAM TO FIX THIS BUT THE DATE WAS UP AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT PAY TO FIX IT.  THE MAZDA DEALER SAID $1100 TO FIX IT.  I WENT NUTS AND TOLD THEM THIS WAS A RIP-OFF.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD CALL MAZDA TO SEE IF THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HELP WITH THE COST SINCE THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THERE WAS A PROGRAM TO FIX IT FOR CUSTOMERS.  THEY CALL BACK LAST THURSDAY TO TELL ME THAT MAZDA WAS NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING IN ANYWAY AND REJECTED THE REQUEST.  I TOLD THEM THIS WOULD MAKE THE DECISION FOR ME ON BUYING A FOURTH MAZDA.

IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT I HAD A SMALL HOLE IN THE CONDENSER CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LOSE TRANSMISSION OIL.  I DO A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING THUS THE HIGH MILEAGE SO THEY SURMISED THAT MAYBE A ROCK HIT IT.  I THOUGHT THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS BECAUSE THIS VEHICLE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE DURABLE SINCE IT IS A SUV.  MY DRIVING IS NOT IN ROUGH TERRAIN JUST SMOOTH HIGHWAYS.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT POINTED OUT  TO ME THAT THE STYLE HAS THESE EXPOSED OR OPEN AREAS IN THE FRONT LOWER PART OF THE SUV SO BECAUSE THEY SAW A TINY ROCK EMBEDDED IN THE GRILL OF THE RADIATOR THAT POSSIBLY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CONDENSER.

I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN BUT I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT A WARRANTY REPAIR WOULD NOT SOLVE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. I'M ALSO CONCERNED THE  PROBLEM WOULD DIE AT THE DEALERSHIP AND NOT BE BROUGHT TO THE PROPER PERSONNEL ATTENTION.  I'M GOING TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE BALL JOINT AND CONTROL ARM BEFORE I TAKE IT IN FOR THE REPAIR. I REALLY DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE NOW THAT I KNOW WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.
