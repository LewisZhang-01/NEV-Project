When looked up Mazda2 issues, found that there was a recall for Steering, Recall no. 16V203000, dated 2016-04-10,  states: If the steering knuckle separates from the strut assembly, it can cause a loss of steering control, increasing the risk of a crash. When the dealership looked up my VIN, it was not a serial number listed under the recall list. However, it had the same issues as the recall. These issues were listed as \"requires immediate attention.\" The Steering rack and pinion, and also the front struts with bearing mounts have all been replaced by the dealership and an alignment was performed. I had to pay for this safety issue out of pocket because my VIN was not listed under the recall list. I would like to report this VIN under the recall list and request a refund for the work performed.",
