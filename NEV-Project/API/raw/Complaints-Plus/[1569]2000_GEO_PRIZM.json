THEY FINALLY HEARD ONE OF THE NOISES AND REPLACED THE AC COMPRESSOR. THEN WE WERE TOLD THE SERPENTINE BELT WAS BAD AND WE NEEDED TO PAY AND HAVE IT REPLACED. WHEN WE ASKED THEM WHY IT WENT BAD  THEY HAD NO ANSWER. WE THEN LEFT TO GO ON VACATION IN NEW YORK. WE MADE IT NEW YORK  AND DURING OUR VACATION THE NOISES GOT WORSE. WE TOOK THE CAR TO FOX AUTO GROUP , INC. IN PAINTED POST,NY. 14870 AND THEY HAD FOUND THE EXHAUST PIPE SHIELD BAD, SERPENTINE BELT (THE 2ND ONE) BAD AGAIN, THE  BELT TENSIONER HAD GONE BAD. THEY SAID THEY DONT SEE HOW  WE MADE IT TO NEW YORK FROM FLORIDA WITH THESE PROBLEMS. WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO A BAD ACCIDENT OR EVEN KILLED AS A RESULT OF THESE PROBLEMS. WE ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SITUATION , FOR NO ONE BELIEVING US EXCEPT FOR FOX AUTO WHO DID A WONDERFUL JOB. HOW CAN DEALERSHIPS, CAR MAKERS TAKE LIFE SO LIGHTLY WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLES LIVES?? WE EVEN HAD TO HAVE MY FATHER IN LAW DRIVE 101 MILES TO GET THE TENSIONER SO WE COULD LEAVE TO HEAD HOME. OUR VACATION WAS RUINED AS A RESULT OF OUR CAR BEING IN THE SHOP FOR A WEEK.
