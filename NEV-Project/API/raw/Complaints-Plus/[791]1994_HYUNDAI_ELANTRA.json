THE DOOR HANDLES IN THE SUMMER GET HOT AND MELT AND FALL OFF, I'VE HAD TO REPLACED ALL DOOR HANDLES IN THE INTERIOR, SAID THIS WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. MY A/C KNOBS KEEP FALLING OFF AND BREAKING, AND THIS IS ALSO NOT UNDER WARRANTY, SO AT MY COST THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE. A RECENT PROBLEM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER WASHER HOSE LOCATED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WIND WELL WAS FROZEN, AND NOW IS BROKEN DUE TO THE INCLEMENT  WEATHER  FROZE UP.  LAST MONTH THE HOSE SNAPPED IN TWO PIECES. I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE PURCHASED FOR A OWNERS MANUAL AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE.  I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THESE CARS WHERE RECALLED IN 94 AND 95 .AND I WAS NOT TOLD AT TIME OF PURCHASE. I AM WANDERING IF THE CAR WAS CHECKED OUT FOR THESE RECALLED MATTERS.
