ON NOV. 29, 2018 THE INSTITUTE OF HIGHWAY SAFETY RELEASED A REPORT THAT SAID THAT 'MOST BASE MODEL CARS HAVE POOR-QUALITY HEADLIGHTS.  MY COMPLAINT IS THE CAR MANUFACTURERS CREATED THIS PROBLEM WHEN THEY DECIDED DECADES AGO THAT PLASTIC WAS A BETTER SHIELD OVER THE HEADLIGHTS THAN GLASS.    MY SUGGESTION IS TO MAKE THE CAR MANUFACTURERS GO BACK TO INSTALLING GLASS OVER THEIR HEADLIGHTS OR U.S. DRIVERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE CLOUDY HEADLIGHTS.  EVEN WHEN WE BUFF THEM OUT AND MAKE THEM SHINE AGAIN, IT ONLY LAST 6 OR 7 YEARS.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CHANGE THIS FLAW IN AUTO MANUFACTURING BY MAKING IT A LAW TO USE GLASS WHEN THEY BUILD THEIR HEADLIGHTS IN THE FUTURE.",

ALTHOUGH IN THE PAST SUBARU ACKNOWLEDGED THE FAILURES AND REPAIRED THEM UNDER THE WWP99 CAMPAIGN (1998-2002 MODEL YEARS).  WHILE THIS FAILURE CONTINUES TO BE WIDESPREAD (JUST GOOGLE SUBARU HEAD GASKET PROBLEMS AND YOU'LL GET PAGES OF COMPLAINTS OF HG FAILURES) SUBARU HAS STOPPED REPAIRING THEM OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING THERE IS A PROBLEM. THIS APPEARS TO BE SOLELY A COST SAVING STRATEGY.     WHEN THE GASKETS FAIL, OIL LEAKS OUTSIDE THE ENGINE WHICH CONTACTS THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. THE BURNING OIL PUTS SMOKE AND FUMES INSIDE THE CAR.  I WOULD THINK THIS IS ALSO A FIRE CONCERN.  INSIDE THE ENGINE, OIL AND COOLANT MIX AND CAN CAUSE CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE/FAILURE.     IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO GET THIS REPAIRED BY SUBARU?  THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING AWAY WITH A HUGE CONSUMER INJUSTICE JUST BY ACTING LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST.  CAN THEY BE REQUIRED EXTENT THE CHAMPAGNE (WWP99) WITH THE 03 AND LATER MODELS? SUBARU CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGES A HEAD GASKET PROBLEM IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND LATER MODEL YEARS HAVE THE SAME FAILURE.   *TR",

THE CAR WAS RUNNING..    . AS I WAS IN THE CAR I DIDN'T NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS ROLLING.  IT MADE NO GRINDING SOUND AS IT SHOULD HAVE IF IT WAS SLIPPING OUT OF GEAR.

I NEVER THOUGHT OF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AS I WAS PANICKED. IN MARCH OF 2007 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A VERY SERIOUS SPINAL CONDITION AND HAD TO GET A FIVE LEVEL NECK SURGERY TO KEEP FROM BECOMING PARALYZED.  I WAS TOLD THAT IF I GOT HIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK OR WAS IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT I COULD BE PARALYZED. THE CAR REACHED A SPEED OF ABOUT 10 MILES PER HOUR AND I SLAMMED INTO OUR 1997 RODEO ISUZU.  THANKFULLY THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY AND JOLT MY HEAD AND I BRACED MY HANDS ON THE DASH.  I SUFFERED ONLY MINOR WRIST SPRAINS AND MULTIPLE BRUISES AND SOME NECK SORENESS AND ABSOLUTE PHYSICAL SHOCK. I HAVE HAD NIGHTMARES ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. WE CALLED HIGHWAY PATROL AND OUR INSURANCE COMPANY. I DID NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO GET MEDICAL ATTENTION AS I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED.
