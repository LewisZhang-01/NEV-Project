AFTER INSPECTION, WE HAD HAD A BLOWOUT ON THE LEFT INSIDE REAR TIRE.  IT HAD BLOWN OUT ON THE TOP SIDE TEARING THE DUCT WORK TO THE FURNACE UP. WE ALSO NOTICED ON THE OTHER, THE REAR RIGHT OUTSIDE TIRE HAD A BUBBLE ON IT.  BOTH WERE ON THE SIDWALLS.  AFTER PURCHASING A USED TIRE TO GET US HOME THE OTHER TIRE BLOW OUT WHILE SITTING AT THE HOUSE THE NEXT DAY.  I HAVE MADE SEVERAL CALLS TO THE MANUFACTURE AND EVEN SENT THE TIRES TO THEM.  THEY SAID IT WAS A ZIPPER RIP AND WAS NOT COVERED.  THE TIRES ONLY HAD 16,000 MILES ON THEM AND WERE ONLY A YEAR AND A HALF OLD.  THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS MAINTAINED CORRECTLY AND WE HAD THE COACH WEIGHED AND IT WAS NOT OVER LOADED AND HAS NEVER BEEN OVERLOADED.  THIS SEEMS TO BE THE EXCUSE THEY US FOR EVERYONE INSTEAD OF EXCEPTING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.",
