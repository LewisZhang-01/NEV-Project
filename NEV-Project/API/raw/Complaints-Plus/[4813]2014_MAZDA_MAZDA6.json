I FIXED THE CAR FOR TIRES AND RIMS AND NOW AFTER A WHILE I RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER ABOUT MAZDA'S TIRE PRESSURE ALARM SOFTWARE ISSUES. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY UPDATED THE SOFTWARE AS PART OF RECALL. I REQUESTING REFUND FOR THE EXPENSES IN MY TWO INCIDENTS DUE TO SAFETY ISSUES. AFTER ALL, I DO NOT TRUST RIDING THE CAR WITH MY 2 YEARS OLD CHILD AT ALL.   *TR",

THE BALL JOINT SEPARATED FROM ITS HOUSING IN THE RIGHT, LOWER CONTROL ARM, CAUSING THE BOTTOM OF THE WHEEL TO COLLAPSE INWARD AND THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL AND IMPACT THE CAR IN THE LEFT LANE.  THE BALL AND STUD WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE UPRIGHT CLAMP, BUT THE BALL JOINT HOUSING WAS MISSING AND NOT RECOVERED.  THE TIE ROD, TIE ROD END AND THE STRUT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DAMAGED. IN PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS (2009-2013), THE LOWER CONTROL ARM APPEARS TO BE A SINGLE, SOLID, FORGED STEEL PIECE WITH AN INTEGRATED BALL JOINT, A DESIGN FOR WHICH A SIDE FORCE IS UNLIKELY TO SEPARATE THE BALL FROM THE CONTROL ARM WITHOUT SHEARING THE BALL STUD.  THE LOWER CONTROL ARM IN THE 2014 MODEL YEAR IS A NEW DESIGN MADE FROM A STAMPED STEEL PLATE WITH A SEPARATE BALL JOINT. THE HOUSING OF THE BALL JOINT IS PRESSED INTO A STAMPED HOLE WITH A LIP IN THE PLATE.  THE SIDES OF THE CONTROL ARM HAVE STRENGTHENING LIPS THAT EXTEND ONLY TO ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE BALL JOINT AND THEN STOP.  THE OUTER END OF THE CONTROL ARM IS A FLAT PLATE WITHOUT A STRENGTHENING LIP.  THE FLAT OUTER END WAS FOLDED BACK FLAT OVER THE TOP OF THE CONTROL ARM IN THIS ACCIDENT.",
