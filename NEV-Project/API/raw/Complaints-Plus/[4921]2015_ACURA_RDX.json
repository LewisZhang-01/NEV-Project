The findings were that the internal reflector has deteriorated and is not projecting light properly. It seems like the 2014 Acura RDX has a recall in place for this same issue but the 2015 does not.  Without adequate lighting, it is nearly impossible to drive at night. I can hardly see 20 feet in front of me--a huge safety issue. My inability to see what's around me while driving in the dark is a huge liability to other motorists around me. This has forced me to only drive in daylight.

I received a repair quote of $2,196.00.  There are no warning lights or anything alarming me that there's an issue with the light output.

I have cleaned the lens, and replaced the bulbs 3 times in the last 3 months, and now they are so bad that I don't dare drive the car at night.  I googled the problem and found a whole litany of Acura RDX owners who have experienced the same problem at the same time. see: https://www.carproblemzoo.com/acura/rdx/headlights-problems.php  I have contacted Acura who acknowledge that they have replaced some of the 2015 RDX headlight issues, but only if the car was built in 2014. The 2014 RDX did experience a recall for the same, exact reason. However, when I checked my VIN, they say that it doesn't qualify for the recall.  This is crazy. My car cannot be driven at night, and the estimated repair for a problem due to their shoddy design/workmanship is approx $1250 per headlight! Unacceptable.

The only way that I can drive my car at night is if I keep my headlights on bright the entire time which causes two safety hazards: 1. If I don't keep the headlights on high beam, I can barely see the road in front of me. 2. If I continue to shine my high beams on an oncoming car, with today's environment, I may suffer repercussions from the other driver. I did a little research and found out that quite a few owners of the 2015 RDX are experiencing the same problem once their mileage reaches 90K. I contacted the Acura Dealership and they told me that they know about the problem and the only way to fix it is to replace the entire headlight assembly at a cost to the customer of $2200. Not only don't I have this kind of money, it is not fair to me or any other customer.  I purchased this car brand new and Acura needs to stand behind there product.

I'VE WRITTEN ACURA AND THEY SAID THEY WON'T COVER THIS SINCE IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT'S DUE TO \"EXTERIOR INFLUENCES\".  MAYBE THIS TYPE OF FOGGING CAN OCCUR BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN OVER THIS SHORT OF A TIME FRAME.  I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THIS OCCURRED BUT FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM ABOUT 8 WEEKS AGO.    I HAVE TO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHTS SINCE IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AT NIGHT OR IN OTHER LIMITED VISIBILITY CONDITIONS. *JS",
