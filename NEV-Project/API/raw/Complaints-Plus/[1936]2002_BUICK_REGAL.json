I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT THE LOU BACHRODT DEALERSHIP CLAIMS IS FEDERALLY MANDATED RESTRICTIONS ON PARTS MANUFACTURE, WHICH ARE NOT AS DURABLE AS ON MY PREVIOUS 1994 REGAL, WHICH I HAD FOR EIGHT YEARS, WITH NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS.  THE BRAKES ARE NOT ASBESTOS ANYMORE AND ARE PRONE TO RUSTING OUT, AND NEED TO BE REPLACED ALL TOO EARLY. THE PLASTIC MATERIALS  OF THE OTHER PARTS IS NOT MADE FOR RELIABILITY NOR DURABILITY.    IN SEPTEMBER 2003 THERE WAS A RECALL #030334 FOR INSTALLING NEW NUTS AND TABLETS . I HAVE THE PART NUMBERS. MILEAGE 19135.    SEPTEMBER 2004 THERE WAS NOISE FROM REAR BRAKES, AND FOR WHICH THE ROTORS HAD RUSTED AND HAD TO BE REFACED; MILEAGE 29489.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY ON A NEW CAR WITH THIS LOW MILEAGE.    JUNE 2005 THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH STEERING. IT SEEMED AS THO THERE WERE LOOSE BOLTS IN THE FRONT WHEELS. THE DEALER LOU BACHRODT (THEY HAVE DONE ALL THESE  REPAIRS) SAID THE SHAFT OF THE STEERING COLUMN WAS DISINTEGRATING AND HAD NO GREASE. MILEAGE 37631. THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT, TO THE TUNE OF $789.79. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES FUEL INJECTOR SYSTEM CLEANING; TRANSMISSION FLUSH SERVICE AND TUNE UP AND REPLACEMENT OF THE PLENUM GASKET WHICH THEY STATED WAS LEAKING.    LOU BACHRODT SERVICE MANAGER STATES THEY HAVE NOT YET HAD A RECALL FOR THIS STEERING COLUMN SHAFT PROBLEM, BUT  I BELIEVE I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF MY CAR AND CAUSED A VERY BAD ACCIDENT TO OTHERS, AS WELL AS MYSELF FROM THIS BAD NEW DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

THERE IS AN INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE DISPLAY CIRCUIT WHICH INDICATES THE GEAR THE CAR IS IN. ON START-UP, THERE IS NO DISPLAY OF SHIFT POSITION OR RADIO DISPLAY. ABOUT 30-40 SECONDS LATER, THERE IS AN AUDIBLE \"TINK\" DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER  IN THE DASH. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A DEFECTIVE RELAY IN THE CIRCUIT, AND I AM NOT GOING TO GET \"CAUGHT\" ON THIS ONE AFTER THE WARRENTY PERIOD IS UP. THIS REPORT ESTABLISHES AN OFFICAL RECORD OF THE PROBLEM TO ENSURE FUTURE REPAIR. IT IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS TO HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT GEAR ONE IS IN , OTHER THAN GUESSING!    MR",
