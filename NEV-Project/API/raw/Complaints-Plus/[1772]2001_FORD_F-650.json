THE EXACT PROBLEM LIES IN THE CLUTCH CYLINDER, WHICH, WE HAVE REPLACED AN AMAZING FIVE TIMES.  AFTER TALKING WITH DEALERS OF THIS TRUCK AND RESEARCHING OTHERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THIS TRUCK FOR COMMERCIAL USE, WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.  NOT ONLY HAVE WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRUCK, BUT THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM IS HAPPENING WITH ANOTHER 2001 F650 THAT WE PURCHASED AT THE SAME TIME.  DUE TO THESE CONTINUAL PROBLEMS WITH THE CLUTCH, WE WERE FORCED TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT.  NOT ONLY WAS THIS COSTLY, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT US FROM CONTINUING TO REPLACE OUR CLUTCH CYLINDER AND EVENTUALLY REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION ONCE AGAIN.  WHEN THE CLUTCH FAILS ON THE HIGHWAY, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSTATE TO STEER THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD.  WE ARE CONSTANTLY DELIVERING TO BUSY METROPOLITAN AREAS,  AND WE PURCHASED THIS TRUCK WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY SAFE.  HOWEVER, THE CLUTCH CONTINUES TO FAIL, AND THE REPLACEMENT PARTS, TOO, ARE DEFECTIVE.  *JB",
