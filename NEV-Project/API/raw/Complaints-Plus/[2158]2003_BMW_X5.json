TOWED THE CAR TO MY LOCAL BMW MECHANIC (HE HAS HIS OWN SERVICE CENTER NOT A DEALER OWNED). DURING PHONE CONVERSATION, HE SUSPECTED ITS SOMETHING TO DO WITH TRANSFERCASE/FRONT DRIVE SHAFT AND UPON PHYSICAL INSPECTION HE CONFIRMED ITS THOSE TWO PARTS. THE SPLINE CONNECTION BETWEEN DRIVE SHAFT AND TRANSFER CASE WENT BAD.  THE MECHANIC KNEW OF THIS ISSUE HAPPENING IN SEVERAL X5S BUT NOT AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE (51K ONLY). ENDED UP REPLACING THE BAD PARTS THROUGH HIM AS I HAD NO HOPES DEALER WILL FIX THIS ISSUE AT THEIR EXPENSE BASED ON SEVERAL READINGS ONLINE AND FEEDBACK FROM OTHER CAR OWNERS. TOTAL REPAIR COST $4000 OEM PARTS PLUS LABOR.    READ IN SEVERAL BMW FORUMS (BIMMERFORUM, BIMMERFEST ETC,) THIS IS VERY COMMON PROBLEM. EXPERTS BELIEVE IT IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FRONT DRIVE SHAFT AND TRANSFER CASE (DRIVE SHAFT BEING AN INCH SHORT).THERE ARE CUSTOM FRONT DRIVE SHAFT AVAILABLE THAT ARE ABOUT 1INCH LONGER THAN THE OEM PART.     ANOTHER FACTOR THAT MAY BE DRIVING THIS ISSUE COULD BE RELATED TO AC CONDENSATE PIPE LOCATION RIGHT ABOVE WHERE THE DRIVE SHAFT AND TRANSFER CASE CONNECTS. I READ THIS IN ANOTHER COMPLAIN BUT UNABLE TO CONFIRM AS I'M NOT THE MECHANIC.    BASED ON THE SAME ISSUE REPORTED SO FAR (AND MANY THAT ARE NOT REPORTED JUST BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS INTERNET SAVVY TO REPORT), IT IS HIGH TIME BMW NEEDS TO BE PUSHED FOR REPAIRING THIS ISSUE IN FUTURE AND REFUND REPAIR COST FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY FIXED IT ON THEIR OWN.  *TR",

SAME FAILURE AT 90K MILES HAD STRANDED CAR ON A LOCAL STREET ABOUT 2.5 YEARS EARLIER. BMW REPLACED TRANSFER CASE AND FRONT DRIVE SHAFT UNDER CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED WARRANTY.

RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE FAILURE IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT SPLINE ENGAGEMENT AND POOR PLACEMENT OF A/C CONDENSATE DRAIN DIRECTLY ABOVE TRANSFER CASE / SHAFT CONNECTION CAUSING ACCELERATED RUSTING OF DRIVE SHAFT SPLINES WHICH EVENTUALLY WEAKEN AND STRIP OUT.

THIS TIME, WHEN THE IGNITION WAS TURNED ON, THE FLASHERS CAME ON AND THE INTERIOR LIGHTS WOULD NOT SHUT OFF WITHOUT ME OPENING THE DOOR AND CLOSING IT AGAIN - I HAD TO MANUALLY SHUT OFF THE FLASHERS.   MINUTES LATER AFTER DRIVING THE CAR, I SHUT OFF THE IGNITION, GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND USED THE KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM TO LOCK THE CAR AND ARM THE ALARM.  I WASN'T ABLE TO LOCK THE CAR DOORS BUT THE ALARM WAS ACTIVATED.  I HAD TO TURN THE ALARM OFF AND OPEN THE DOOR AND CLOSE IT AGAIN.  THEN I WAS ABLE TO LOCK IT.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A VISION PROBLEM.  FOR FIFTY YEARS OR SO, I GENERALLY HAD NO PROBLEM WITH ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS.  THEN CARS WITH THESE NEW HIGH-INTENSITY BEAMS STARTED APPEARING ON ROADS.  THESE LIGHTS ARE PAINFUL TO MY EYES.  THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE.  I WANT TO AVERT MY EYES BUT I KNOW I MUST KEEP MY EYES ON THE ROAD.  AT FIRST I HOPED THEY WOULD JUST GO AWAY OR BE OUTLAWED, BUT THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE AS MORE NEW VEHICLES WITH THESE LIGHTS ENTER THE ROAD.  COMBINE HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHTS WITH AN SUV AND IT IS A PAINFUL AND BLINDING EXPERIENCE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE VEHICLES COMING HEAD-ON OR FROM BEHIND, WITH THE LIGHTS REFLECTING IN MY REARVIEW MIRRORS.    I SEE NO SENSE IN MAKING IT EASIER FOR THOSE WITH THESE OFFENSIVE LIGHTS TO SEE BETTER WHEN IT BLINDS EVERYONE ELSE.  BUT SOON EVERYONE WILL BE BLINDED WHEN ALL CARS HAVE THEM -- UNLESS IT IS STOPPED NOW.      PLEASE DO WHAT YOU CAN TO GET THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS OFF THE ROAD AND LET PEOPLE GO BACK TO THE TYPE OF HEADLIGHTS THAT WORKED JUST FINE FOR 100 YEARS.    THANK YOU,  WES COGAN",
