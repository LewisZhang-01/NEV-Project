I have never noticed on any of them, what I believe is an unsafe driving condition, until now.   On my 2020 Kia Sportage...at night, when dark, and you turn off either Left or Right...for some reason, the light does not follow you...it stays focused straight ahead.  So, for some seconds, you cannot see, until your car straightens out again.  This, I believe is a safety issue.  If there was something, in that blind spot few seconds, you would hit  it;  a child, a biker,  a large hole, an animal or some unexpected thing...because it is impossible to see until the car totally straightens again.  Accidents happen in seconds.  I drive very slowly in turns, since I realized the bad decision someone at KIA made with the lighting package on this car.....but with that extra caution I take, I realize also, that someone coming behind me on the turn, could actually run into me, not expecting me to go slow as I turn off left or right....much slower than I would in daylight. I have called KIA Service and the 800 Customer Service number as well...they just refer you back and forth.  So, I am writing to Consumer Safety hoping you can help.

THIS IS BECAUSE MY ENGINE MAY EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHIC BEARING FAILURE POSSIBLY DESTROYING THE ENGINE. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THIS NOTICE SHOULD BE A RECALL NOTICE.  THEY ARE NOT IMPROVING ANYTHING.  THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT WILL CAUSE THE ENGINE FAILURE HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED AND WON'T BE BY THIS SO CALLED 'PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM'.  I ASKED KIA WHY THEY AREN'T FIXING THE PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINES AT THE FACTORY INSTEAD OF JUST ADDING AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM TO THE ECU?  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.  I DON'T WANT A BRAND NEW CAR THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAVE A TOTAL ENGINE FAILURE.  I DON'T WANT A CAR THAT WARNS YOU THAT YOUR CAR IS ABOUT TO HAVE AN ENGINE FAILURE.  THAT IS NOT A PROPER WAY AT ALL TO FIX A PROBLEM.  YOU FIX A PROBLEM AT THE ENGINE FACTORY...NOT IN THE FIELD.   I AM HAVING THIS PROGRAM UPDATE DONE TOMORROW AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I AM GETTING RID OF MY BRAND NEW 2020 KIA SPORTAGE AND BUYING A CAR, ANY CAR, THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN ENGINE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BLOW UP AT ANY TIME.  KIA HAVE PUT THE ONUS OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE BACKS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.  IT DOESN'T BELONG THERE.  IT BELONGS ON KIA, NOT ME.",
