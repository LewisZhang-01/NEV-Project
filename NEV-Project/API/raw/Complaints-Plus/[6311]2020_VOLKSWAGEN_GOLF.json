I DROVE THE CAR ON THE STREET AT THE SPEED ABOUT 25MPH, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DIED! I TRIED TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE, I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AND PEDAL, IT DIDN'T RESPOND AT ALL. IT SHOWED \"DRIVE MANNUALLY' AND THEN SEVERAL LIGHTS WERE ON, EPC, ENGINEER CHECKING LIGHT ETC, LIGHTS WERE OFF A FEW SECONDS LATER. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME AND NOT ON THE FREEWAY! AT THAT MOMENT, THE CAR WAS OUT OF CONTROL, I LET IT MOVE FORWARD THEN PULLED UP. A MINUTE LATER, I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE, IT WAS BACK TO THE NORMAL. I DROVE IT TO THE DEALER TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM. I TOLD WHAT HAPPENED AND ALSO I FELT IT LACK OF POWER, SOMETIME IT RESPOND SLOWLY. HOWEVER, AFTER SEVERAL HOURS, I WAS TOLD NOTHING WRONG WAS BEEN DETECT AND THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT, SINCE THE COMPUTER DIDN'T TELL THERE WERE ANY ISSUES. ALSO I WAS TOLD TAT A MECHANIC TEST DRIVE ABOUT TEN MILES NOT TO DUPLICATE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE IT HOME. HOWEVER, I STOPPED AT THE STOP SIDE, THE VEHICLE WAS KIND OF DEAD AGAIN! MY CAR STOPPED THERE AND COULD NOT MOVE FOR A FEW SECONDS, A GUY BEHIND ME PRESSED THE HONK. I WAS SO SACARY THAT I WAS AFRAID OF DRIVE HOME VIA THE FREEWAY!  I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN, I TOLD THEM I DON'T FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE IT AT ALL UNLESS YOU FIGURE IT OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT. I TOLD THE MECHANIC THAT I USED TO DRIVE GOLF 2011 FOR FIVE YEARS, MY EXPERIENCE TOLD ME THERE ARE SOMETHING NOT RIGHT WITH THIS CAR, IT LACKS OF POWER AND DOESN'T RESPOND PROPERLY FOR GAS PEDAL AND I CAN SENSE IT CLEARLY.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE MIGHT NOT DO ANYTHING IF THE COMPUTER DOESN'T TELL HIM WHAT ISSUES IT HAS. I LEFT THE CAR FOR THEM TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WHILE DRIVING.",
