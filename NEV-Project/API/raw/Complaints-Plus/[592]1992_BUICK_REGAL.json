HAD I NOT BEEN DRIVING SLOWLY INTO A PARKING LOT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I FEEL THAT BOTH WATER PUMPS WERE DEFECTIVE TO FAIL ON SUCH LOW MILEAGE, AND OTHER 1992 REGALS MIGHT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAVE WRITTEN RECORDS ON ALL OF THIS AS WELL AS ON ALL SERVICE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN PERFORMED IN A TIMELY MANNER. ALSO,  BOTH FRONT SEAT BELTS FAILED WITHIN A YEAR OF EACH OTHER AS I REPORTED AFTER LESS THAN 5 YEARS OF USE. HERE AGAIN, HAD THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING OR INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS WEARING NO SEATBELT AT ALL. I CITE TOBY WELLS AS THE DEALER BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE ALL THESE REPAIRS WERE DONE. THE CAR WAS ACTUALLY PURCHASED AT DICKINSON BUICK, 436 NORTH MCPHERSON CHURCH RD., FAYETTEVILLE, NC 28303 (910) 864-2411.
