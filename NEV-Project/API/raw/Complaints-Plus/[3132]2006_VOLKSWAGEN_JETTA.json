AS I BEGAN TO LOOK UP THESE SYMPTOMS TO VERIFY WHAT THE ISSUE WAS I RAN INTO SOME VERY CONCERNING STATEMENTS. MULTIPLE SOURCES SAY THE CARS ARE KNOWN FOR HAVING BAD TRANSMISSIONS/ VALVE  BODY ISSUES. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DRIVING 2006 VW JETTA 2.5 LITER AUTOMATIC CARS WERE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE HARD SHIFTING AND SLIPPING AND SOME WERE WORSE THAN THAT. MY CAR ONLY HAS 103,000 MILES ON IT AND MANY OF THESE OTHER VEHICLES WERE BETWEEN 75K AND 140K. HAVING TO HAVE ENTIRE TRANSMISSIONS REPLACED. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES WHEN I'M ON THE HIGHWAY AND NOT NEEDING TO SWITCH GEARS BUT STOP AND GO TRAFFIC IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE IN. IT DISCOURAGES ME THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE AND A RECALL HAS NEVER BEEN ISSUED FOR IT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY ANYMORE .

I PURCHASED ANOTHER TURBO OUT OF CALIFORNIA, DUE TO NOT TRUSTING VW ANY LONGER. THIS NEW TURBO WAS INSTALLED AND DID NOT COME WITH THE WASTEGATE MODULE FOR IT WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR IT TO WORK. I SOON DISCOVERED THE WASTEGATE WAS BAD AND NEITHER OF THE TURBOCHARGERS WERE BAD, HOWEVER I HAD TO PURCHASE TWICE THE ENTIRE TURBOS SYSTEM FOR THIS ONE $35 PART THAT IS SOLD ON OTHER JETTA MODELS WITH MANUAL WASTEGATE BUT NOT THIS ONE. VW REFUSES TO SELL THIS PART AND REQUIRES THE WHOLE SYSTEM TO BE PURCHASED. THIS IS CORRUPT AND DISHONEST AND PREYS ON THE CONSUMERS. NOW I AM IN THIS POSITION AGAIN. GREAT CAR OTHER THAN THIS ISSUE.

THE LOCAL VW DEALER TOLD ME TO CONTACT VW CORPORATE, AS I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO REPAIR A DEFECTIVE AIRBAG THAT WAS ALREADY RECALLED IN THE PAST.

WE WERE ABLE TO SWITCH THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON AND THE CONDITION WENT AWAY. I CALLED OUR LOCAL VW DEALER AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR A DIAGNOSTIC.

THIS INVESTIGATION (NHTSA ACTION# PE09035) RESULTED IN A RECALL CAMPAIGN (NHTSA# 09V333000) WHERE VW REPLACED DEFECTIVE MECHATRONICS UNITS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE AFFECTED UNITS TO 10YRS/100,000 MILES.

A NEW INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE OPENED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED FOR SOME OF THEIR VEHICLES.

I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED (AT MY EXPENSE) TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE IT WASN'T SAFE TO DRIVE THE 130 MILES.

I ASKED [XXX] HOW THE CONNECTORS WOULD BECOME FAULTY SINCE THERE IS NOTHING EVER STORED UNDER MY DRIVER SEAT AND NO ONE GOES UNDER THE DRIVER SEAT. [XXX] SAID THAT ??IT JUST HAPPENS.?? I TOLD HIM I WAS DISAPPOINTED VW HAD MADE SUCH A FAULTY CAR BECAUSE OF THE MANY PRIOR PROBLEMS I HAD THAT FORTUNATELY WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, E.G., ESP LIGHT CONTINUALLY ON; IGNITION COILS RECALLED/REPLACED; ASR LIGHT CONTINUALLY LIT; TRUNK LATCH REPLACED, AIR CONDITIONING VENTS BROKE, DRIVER SIDE DOOR WOULD NOT LOCK/UNLOCK; AND DRIVER SIDE BUTTON STOPPED WORKING. AFTER THE WARRANTY ENDED, THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON. I PAID TO REPLACE THE BUTTON FOR THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BECAUSE IT BROKE OFF.  [XXX] TOLD ME THE BUTTON WAS CHEAP AND THEY ALWAYS BREAK.  A RECALL FOR THE SIDE AIR BAG HARNESS ON SEATS WERE REPAIRED ON BOTH SIDES ON 3/30/11. IN OCTOBER, 2011 I TOLD [XXX] I DID NOT BELIEVE I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR OF THE AIR BAG LIGHT AS I BELIEVED IT WAS A DEFECT ON VW PART. I COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THE LIGHT TO COME ON BY DRIVING THE VEHICLE. I WAS INFORMED BY [XXX] THAT WITHOUT THIS REPAIR THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS CONSIDERED TO BE INOPERABLE AND UNSAFE. AFTER REVIEW OF THE NHTSA COMPLAINTS AND AN INTERNET SEARCH, THIS AIRBAG ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN A KNOWN ONE FOR SOME TIME. VW HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS A LARGE CONCERN. I BELIEVE A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED DUE TO THE OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS.

THE VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SERVICED BY A VW DEALERSHIP AT THE SPECIFIED INTERVALS (I CALL THEM THE $400 OIL CHANGES). I COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN INTAKE VALVE POPPING AND COULD FEEL A PULSATION IN THE TURBO INTAKE HOSE. I CHECKED ON SOME OF THE FORUMS AND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF THE EARLY CAMSHAFT FAILURE PROBLEM COMMON TO THE PD ENGINES. IT SEEMS THAT VW NARROWED UP THE INTAKE AND EXHAUST CAM LOBES BY ABOUT 30%  TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE INJECTOR LOBE, AND TRIED TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS INADEQUATE DESIGN BY MANDATING \"SPECIAL\" OIL (WHICH I CAN ONLY HOPE OUR DEALER USED EACH TIME THE OIL WAS CHANGED). IT TURNS OUT THOUGH, THAT A CRITICAL CAN WEAR ADDITIVE IN THIS OIL, ZDDP, IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES CAN CAUSE EARLY FAILURE OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER (AN ITEM WHICH HAS A LONGER WARRANTY PERIOD THAN THE ENGINE). IT SEEMS THAT THE ZDDP ONLY EXISTS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY IN VW \"SPECIAL\" OIL TO GET THROUGH THE ENGINE WARRANTY PERIOD, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING THE CONVERTER FROM WARRANTY FAILURE. I BOUGHT AN AFTER MARKET CAM KIT AND INSTALLED IT MYSELF, SAVING NEARLY $3000 IN THE PROCESS. SINCE THEN WE'VE PUT ANOTHER 60K MILES, USING MOBIL TD TRUCK 5W40 OIL... SO FAR SO GOOD. I THINK THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS DISGRACEFUL AT BEST AND VW SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PD CAMSHAFT FAILURES TO A PERIOD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN THE 80,000 KM WARRANTY. THE PRIMARY REASON WE PAID 32K FOR A COMPACT SEDAN WAS THE REPUTED LONGEVITY OF THE DIESEL ENGINE. THIS FAILURE, ALONG WITH THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL FIASCO HAS MADE OUR PURCHASE OF THIS SILVER COLORED LEMON ANYTHING BUT A GOOD INVESTMENT.

THE MOST CONCERNING ISSUE TO US IS THAT ALL CONTROLS AND POWER ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR DO NOT WORK.

THE BLINKER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE MIRROR DOES NOT WORK, THE SAFETY LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED, THERE IS NO CONTROL OF THE CHILD SAFETY LOCKS, AND THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE MIRRORS CANNOT BE ADJUSTED.  I KNOW THAT VOLKSWAGEN TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE SAFETY OF ITS VEHICLES, AND AS ONE CAN SEE, WITH THE LOSS OF POWER TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THESE FEATURES ARE USELESS. I SHUTTER TO WONDER IF THE AIRBAGS IN THE CAR ARE ALSO ON SAME WIRING AS THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THESE ARE ALL HUGE SAFETY CONCERNS TO US.  AND NOW, WITHIN THE PAST TWO WEEKS THE TRUNK SPORADICALLY WON'T CLOSE AND THE BATTERY IS LOOSING ITS CHARGE, WHICH WE KNOW MAY BE A NORMAL MAINTENANCE ISSUE, BUT IT IS JUST ONE MORE THING.  IT FEELS AS IF THERE IS A NEW ISSUE EVERY WEEK! .  WE NOW FEEL 'STUCK' WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD TO FIX.  SO WE AVOID DRIVING IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE OUR FAMILY WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AROUND IN.  IN ADDITION TO THE SAFETY CONCERNS, THE CAR CANNOT BE DRIVEN THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH RESTAURANT OR A TOLLBOOTH SINCE THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW WILL NOT COME DOWN.  I'M SURE THIS IS NOT THE REPUTATION VOLKSWAGEN WANTS FOR ITS VEHICLES.  WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FEEL HELPLESS.

IF YOU GOOGLE \"CAMSHAFT WEAR IN PUMP DUSE TDI ENGINES\" YOU WILL FIND A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM. IN MANY CASES SUCH A SEVERE PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR, BUT THIS PROBLEM COULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO SEIZE COMPLETELY. I INSISTED THAT THE DEALER RETURN THE FAILED PARTS TO ME, BUT THEY REFUSED BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED A WARRANTY REPAIR.

IN JUNE OF 2010 WE FIRST NOTICED THE STALLING ISSUE WHEN DRIVING HOME AND IT STALLED OUT WHILE PULLING INTO THE DRIVEWAY.  AFTER SITTING FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES WE WERE ABLE TO PULL IT INTO THE GARAGE.    THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON FRIDAY 7/30/2010, WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK (30 MILE COMMUTE) AT 45-55 MPH THE JETTA STARTED TO INTERMITTENTLY LOSE POWER BEFORE THE ENGINE COMPLETELY STALLED.  NOTE: I WAS STILL TRAVELING AT 55 MPH WHEN THE ENGINE STALLED.  IT WOULD RESTART AND BEGAN EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES. WE TOWED THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP.  THEY RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND DID NOT FIND ANY ERROR CODES FROM THE CAR'S COMPUTER.  THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY THINKING THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE.    WE PICKED UP THE CAR ON TUESDAY 8/3/2010 IN THE MORNING.  WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK THAT SAME DAY (30 MILE COMMUTE) THE ENGINE BEGAN EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE, INTERMITTENTLY LOSING POWER WHILE TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70-80 MPH.  AFTER EXITING THE INTERSTATE THE SYMPTOMS CONTINUED TO GET WORSE AND THE ENGINE COMPLETELY STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION ALMOST CAUSING A MULTI-CAR ACCIDENT.  AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO RESTART AND REPEATED ENGINE STALLS I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO GAS STATION WHERE IT WAS TOWED TO THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALER FOR A 2ND TIME.      ONLY GOOD NEWS OF THIS STORY, THE VW MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE ENGINE STALL ISSUE AFTER TEST DRIVING THE JETTA FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.      VW DEALER REPORTED THE RESULT TO VW MANUFACTURER TECH SUPPORT.  VW DEALER KEPT THE CAR FOR MORE THAN 1 WEEK TO RUN MORE TESTS PER VW TECH SUPPORT.  ULTIMATELY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL FILTER.

CAR WAS GARAGED OVER A 3 DAY WEEKEND AND NOT DRIVEN AT ALL. MONDAY MY WIFE GOES TO START IT AND IT WILL NOT START, AFTER TELLING ME I TRY FOR 3 MINUTES TO GET IT STARTED AND IT FINALLY STARTS. TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY FIND NO ISSUES, THEY BLAME COLD START AS THE CULPRIT. THIS IS A BS CALL AS THE CAR WAS AND IS ALWAYS GARAGED AT 50+ DEGREES F.    ROUGHLY 3 WEEKS LATER THE SAME SITUATION HAPPENS AND THE CAR GOES BACK TO THE DEALER. TO NO AVAIL THEY STILL COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE NOR FIND A SOLUTION.    THE NO START ISSUE/ HARD START ISSUE SEEMED TO PROGRESS FROM SITTING FOR 3 DAYS AND NOT STARTING TO RANDOMLY MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK NOT STARTING. THEY STILL CANNOT FIND A SOLUTION.    I FIRMLY BELIEVE THIS IS A FUEL ISSUE.    ON TO TODAY'S ISSUE:    FIRST NOTICED 3 WEEKS AGO WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PASS A CAR ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70MPH (AROUND 4K RPM), THE CAR DOWN SHIFTED AND STUTTERED RATHER THEN INCREASING SPEED. I THOUGHT IT WAS A 1 TIME ISSUE UNTIL I STARTED NOTICING IT MORE AND MORE. NOW IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY AND MORE PRONOUNCED STARTING AT EVEN 35MPH/3400 RPM IN 3RD GEAR.    FROM 10AM TUESDAY TO 5PM FRIDAY OUR JETTA WAS BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE OF A STUTTER/POWER LOSS ISSUE. THEY DID REPLACE THE FUEL FILTER TODAY AS WELL AS TEST THE FUEL (WHICH TESTED FINE), THE EGR VALVE WAS CLEANED WITH A CARB CLEANER. THE SERVICE MANAGER DROVE THE CAR OFTEN AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THE POWER LOSS / STUTTER, HOWEVER THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THEY CALLED THE VW TECH LINE MULTIPLE TIMES AND STILL NO FIX ONCE AGAIN.   CAR DIED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY.  TURNING ONTO THE HIGHWAY THE CAR STUTTERED AND THEN .5 MILES LATER IT DIED AT 45MPH IN TRAFFIC. PULLED OVER AND CRANKED FOR 3 MINUTES. *TR",

HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO REACH THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. PRND WAS LIT UP AND FLASHING AND THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM SYMBOL HAD ERRATIC FLASHING. TRIED PARK, NEUTRAL, REVERSE NOTHING HAPPENED. PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND SHUT OFF ENGINE. RESTARTED ENGINE AND IT ALLOWED US TO DRIVE OFF. WENT APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES DRIVING AT ABOUT 55 MPH, THOUGHT WE SEEN AN ANIMAL AND LET OFF THE ACCELERATOR. UPON TRYING TO ACCELERATE, INCIDENT DESCRIBED ABOVE HAPPENED AGAIN, THIS TIME A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED. BEFORE CALLING THE DEALER WE DID A SEARCH AND CAME ACROSS THIS SITE. OUR VEHICLE HAD A DSG TRANSMISSION SERVICE (FOR A COST OF $286.75) AT 43,703 MILES AND THE CAR NOW HAS 71,491 MILES. THIS VEHICLE ALSO HAS A PROBLEM AT TIMES, THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE DEALER ON JUNE 5, 2007 AND NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT, ON COLD START UP, PUTTING IT IN GEAR AND HAVING A VERY SEVERE JERKING, ALMOST TO THE POINT THAT IT MIGHT STALL THE ENGINE.\"  UPDATE 10-3-09:  FOR FEAR OF HAVING ANOTHER OCCURRENCE, THE CAR WAS TOWED (70+ MILES) TO DEALER IN LATE AUGUST, DIAGNOSIS WAS IT NEEDED A NEW MECHATRONICS UNIT.  DELIVERY TIME FOR PART WAS OVER A MONTH. TALKED TO MECHANIC AT VW, HE RECOMMENDED TO NOT DRIVE THE CAR FOR SAFETY REASONS.

THE SUMMARY IS EXTREMELY RAPID REAR PAD WEAR, WHILE THEN FRONT, WHICH HAVE THE WEAR SENSOR, REMAIN UNSCATHED. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THE DEALER ADMITS ITS PART OF A ?SAFE BRAKING? DESIGN THAT TRIES TO MAKE THE CAR SQUAT RATHER THAN DIVE.    THE PROBLEM IS, THIS IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL METHOD OF BRAKE APPLICATION (REAR BIASED WHEN PHYSICS HAS THE FRONTS NORMALLY DOING MORE WORK), COMBINED WITH A CONVENTIONAL BRAKE DESIGN THAT HAS SMALLER PARTS AND NO WEAR SENSORS IN THE REAR.     THE RESULT OF THIS ?SAFETY FEATURE? IS THAT I CAN EXPECT TO WEAR OUT REAR PADS FASTER THAN FRONT, IN AS LITTLE AS 9-10K MILES. THE PROBLEM IS A REASONABLY MINDED PERSON WOULD NOT COME TO THIS CONCLUSION, AND THE LACK OF A REAR PAD WEAR WARNING SYSTEM CREATES A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE. THE USER MANUAL DOES NOT WARN THAT REAR PADS MAY WEAR FASTER, AND IN FACT INDICATES THEY SHOULD BE INSPECTED EACH 10 K, OR WHEN THE FRONT WEAR SENSOR ILLUMINATES.  BOTH OF THESE CASES MAY BE TOO LATE, LEADING AT BEST TO EXPENSIVE REPAIRS WHEN THE ROTORS ARE DAMAGED, OR WORSE, TO UNPREDICTABLE BRAKING IN AN EMERGENCY. IF I HAVE MY CAR INSPECTED AT 10K, AND THE REARS ARE STILL SERVICEABLE, I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD MAKE IT TO 20K.

LAST WEEK WE SUDDENLY STARTED SEEING THE DASHBOARD WARNING \"AIR BAG FAULT\".  UPON TAKING IT TO THE LOCAL VWOA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THIS INVESTIGATED WE WERE INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A VWOA TECHNICAL BULLETIN (THAT EVIDENTLY HAD BEEN OUT FOR SOME TIME) WHICH INDICATED THAT SOME CONNECTOR(S) LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT THAT ARE RELATED TO THE AIR BAG SYSTEM WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS NOT A MAINTENANCE ITEM NOR ANYTHING THAT WE COULD HAVE CAUSED BUT VWOA IS INDICATING THAT DUE TO THE AUTO NOT BEING WITHIN THE WARRANTY (4 YEAR AND/OR 50,000 MILES AS WE'VE BEEN TOLD) THAT WE WILL NOW HAVE TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $400 TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED.  WE WERE FURTHER INFORMED BY THE VWOA SERVICE THAT WITHOUT THIS REPAIR THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS CONSIDERED TO BE IN AN \"UNSTABLE STATE\" AND COULD POTENTIALLY NOT ACTIVATE THE AIRBAG WHEN NEEDED OR POSSIBLY ACTIVATE AT AN INAPPROPRIATE TIME.  THE VW DEALER ALSO SAID THAT VWOA CONSIDERS THIS TO BE SO UNSAFE THAT THEY ISSUE A FREE RENTAL AND REQUIRE THE REPAIR TO BE MADE BEFORE RELEASING THE AUTO AGAIN....BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE UNDER WARRANTY.  VWOA DID MANAGE TO COME THROUGH WITH SOME \"GOOD WILL ASSISTANCE\" (THEIR WORDS) BY PROVIDING $200 TOWARDS THE REPAIR.    THIS AIRBAG ISSUE HAS BEEN A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE 2006 VW JETTA (MAYBE OTHER YEARS AS WELL I'M NOT SURE) FOR SOME TIME.  VWOA INDICATES THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT A MAJOR CONCERN AND IS THEREFORE NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  I HAVE READ SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA AND OTHER SITES THAT SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE THAN VWOA STATES.  I THINK A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED DUE TO THE OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS INVOLVED WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.  HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE BEFORE ANY INJURIES AND/OR FATALITIES OCCUR.  *TR",

THIS WEEK, THE CLUTCH STARTED SLIPPING AND IT WARRANTED A VISIT TO THE LOCAL VW DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT MANY 2006 VW JETTA TDI 5-SPD VEHICLES WERE MADE WITH A DEFECTIVE CLUTCH PLATE, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE MY TRANSMISSION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MY VEHICLE HAD THE DEFECTIVE PART.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT IF MY VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PART, THEY WOULD CHARGE ME NEARLY $500 IN LABOR FEES FOR REMOVING THE TRANSMISSION FOR INSPECTION.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY VEHICLE INSPECTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS THE DEFECTIVE PART, NOR SHOULD I HAVE TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE WHEN THIS CLUTCH HAS BEEN FAILING PREMATURELY.    UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS CLUTCH PLATE ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE.  I ALSO FOUND 88 PAGES ON ONE FORUM ALONE (HTTP://FORUMS.TDICLUB.COM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=137014)  ABOUT THIS PART AND THE CLUTCH/FLYWHEEL ASSEMBLY FAILING PREMATURELY.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO PAY FOR A NEW CLUTCH AT A COST OF OVER $2000.00.  SOME WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS CLUTCH PLATE AND THE CORRESPONDING ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN RECALLED BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN MANY COUNTRIES EXCEPT FOR THE UNITED STATES.  I FEAR HAVING MY CLUTCH FAIL WHEN I NEED THE ENGINE TO BE ENGAGED.  IF I WERE TO HAVE A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER, IT COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND ENDANGER MYSELF AND THE OCCUPANTS OF MY VEHICLE.    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO BRING THIS PROBLEM TO THE SURFACE, AND PROMPT AN INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA TO LOOK INTO THIS KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE?  THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS NEED TO BE RECALLED AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.  IT SEEMS THAT NHTSA IS IGNORING THIS MATTER AT THE CONSUMER'S EXPENSE, AND THE AUTOMAKERS BENEFIT.  *TR",

FIRST SIGN OF MAJOR PROBLEM WAS TOTAL CLUTCH FAILURE (PEDAL STUCK TO FLOOR, UNABLE TO SHIFT) AFTER ABOUT 30 MIN. IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC ON INTERSTATE IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION ZONE.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE:  THIS FAILURE CAUSES DRIVER TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND HAS POTENTIAL TO CAUSE HIGH SPEED CRASH IN HEAVY TRAFFIC MERGING CONDITIONS.  THIS IS ALSO A KNOWN ISSUE:  ONLINE READING QUICKLY REVEALS THAT THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL & CLUTCH ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR SOME TIME, AND THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS FOUND IN THE 2005.5 & 2006 JETTA TDI.  THREE EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE FOR THIS ARE:  #1. TO DATE, 46 MEMBERS OF THE ONLINE FORUM TDICLUB.COM HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS LOW MILEAGE CLUTCH AND/OR FLYWHEEL FAILURE.  #2. VW HAS HAD RECALLS IN BOTH FINLAND AND AUSTRALIA FOR SAME/SIMILAR ISSUES.  #3. THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION OF SINGLE MASS FLYWHEEL & CLUTCH ADVERTISED AT DIESELGEEK.COM STATES:  GETS RID OF THE FAILURE PRONE STOCK SACHS DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL.  I REPEAT, THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, IT SEEMS THAT VW KNOWS THAT ORIGINAL PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE OR NOT UP TO THE JOB AS THEY HAVE UPGRADED THE REPLACEMENT PARTS.  BUT VW REFUSES TO PAY FOR REPAIRS, CITING OWNER ERROR AND/OR WEAR-AND-TEAR.  MY REPAIR COST $1700 AND VW SHOULD REIMBURSE ME.  THE REPAIRED CLUTCH IS SMOOTHER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN, INDICATION THAT IT WAS DEFECTIVE FROM DAY ONE.  FAR MORE IMPORTANT:  VW SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR KILLED.  I AM FURIOUS AT VW!  THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WHEN I DROVE MY NEW CAR OFF THE LOT IN JUNE 06.  AT THE VERY LEAST, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE ISSUE AND TO BE MINDFUL OF CLUTCH OPERATION.

APPARENTLY FOR THE 2006 VW JETTA, THE REAR PADS WEAR OUT BEFORE THE FRONT PADS. I CONSIDER THIS A MAJOR DESIGN DEFECT ESPECIALLY SINCE THE REAR BRAKE SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE THE PRIMARY BRAKE LOAD CARRIER, AT LEAST BASED ON THE SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROTORS:     A) FRONT ROTORS ARE 25MM VENTILATED    B) REAR ROTORS ARE 12MM UNVENTILATED    THE REAR BRAKES WEARING OUT BEFORE THE FRONTS FOR THE VW JETTA IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO. SEARCH THE VW FORUMS AND YOU WILL FIND MANY CASES OF THIS.    3) VW WILL BE REPLACING BOTH REAR ROTORS AND PADS UNDER WARRANTY; NOT SURE ABOUT KEEPING THE OLD PARTS SINCE THE WORK WILL BE DONE UNDER VW WARRANTY.

IT IS NOW A WEEK AND A HALF LATER AND THE IGNITION KEY WOULDN'T TURN IN THE IGNITION. I CONTINUED TO SWITCH BETWEEN MY ALARM KEY AND MECHANIC KEY  UNTIL IT FINALLY TURNED AND STARTED. ONCE ON THE ROAD THE CAR DIED IN MID DRIVE. THE ENGINE COMPLETELY TURNED OFF WHILE DOING ABOUT 25MPG. THANK GOD THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND ME, THE CAR CAME TO A STOP AND RESTARTED IMMEDIATELY AND DRIVEN BACK TO WORK. LEAVING WORK THE CAR DIDN'T TURN OVER AT ALL. YOU COULD HEAR THE CRANKING OF THE ENGINE BUT WAS NOT TURNING OVER, THE SAME PROBLEM AS BEFORE. THE CAR IS NOW AT THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN, NO LOANER CAR WAS GIVEN TO ME AND THERE WAS SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ALREADY UNDERWAY. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE CARS ENGINES SOUND.
