Some weeks ago later I started to have issues with my vehicle as it was not driving properly. I then started contacting both my local Nissan and Corporate. Nissan confirmed my vehicle VIN was one of the vehicles with transmissions issues and that I needed a transmission replacement for a cost of $4,324.11. I then opened a case and Corporate as there have multiple complaints/class actions for the same reason and they came back and stated they could not assist because I was out of the warranty year/milage. Nissan delivered a faulty transmission which they were very aware of at some point after delivery and although my transmission held off  before it completely needed to be replaced I am looking for Nissan to assist financially for a new transmission which they quoted me $4,324.11 as they manufactured and delivered a faulty transmission which is a common issue with these vehicles.

After the recall, I again took the car in as the sensor still came on periodically incorrectly.  This was on 10/11/16.  At that time, they said the programming had not been completed and so they completed it.  This also did not fix the sensor.  I took it in again on May 10, 2017. The notes on the repair order say:  \"Customer states intermit when passenger is occupies in front passenger seat the passenger side air bag light comes on check and advise. No active codes. Performed zero point reset.\"  Nothing was found again.  Frustrated, I didn't know what to do.  Fast forward to today (August 23, 2021), I took it in to finally resolve the issue as I am interested in selling it soon.  I was shocked that they came back and said it would cost me $1010.68 to fix something that I have tried to get them to fix for 7 years.

I took it to the car dealer shortly after the incident occurred and they maintenance the secondary hood latch but never did anything to the primary hood latch which should have never had opened especially while I was driving. I put in a claim with Nissan regarding the primary hood latch disengaging on its own two times in 2 months. I specifically told them numerous times that I do not feel safe driving my car anymore in that I would like to be financially compensated because now I have to go out and purchase another vehicle. I explained to them that I did not plan on buying a new car especially because my Nissan only had 77,000 MIles on it and was paid in full. I had also told them that I'm on a fixed income and having to purchase a new vehicle along  with taking on car payments would cost me and my family a tremendous financial hardship. As of today Nissan has not  done anything to compensate me. They are saying that I must have accidentally disengaged the primary hood latch both times the hood popped open.",

On some affected vehicles, and under severe corrosion conditions, one of the rear lower suspension links may corrode and separate at the bushing joint area\". I live in Buffalo, NY area which is a high-salt state. Nissan will not cover this repair ($1146.57 includes NYS taxes) because the campaign does not include my VIN and was for 2013 models; my vehicle is 2014.  The auto repair shop told us that the lower control arm in my 2014 vehicle was a 2013 part, so it was subject to the same defect that prompted the 2013 recall.  Nissan refuses any assistance with this repair and says the VIN number is not included on the lower suspension link repair.

I WAS TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE HAS ABOUT $1,500 WORTH OF REPAIRS NEEDED BECAUSE OF SOME RUST/CORROSION ISSUES WITH THE REAR LOWER LINKS. AFTER DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT IT ONLY APPLIES TO 2013 ALTIMAS IN THE US, BUT BOTH 2013 AND 2014 ALTIMAS IN CANADA. SO I WANTED TO REACH OUT TO YOU AND SEE IF YOU COULD ADD A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THIS AND HOW IT MAKES ANY SENSE THAT THERE IS A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE 2014 ALTIMAS AND SO THEY OFFER A PROGRAM LIKE THIS, BUT THEN LEAVE OUT THE 2014 MODEL IN THE US, BUT INCLUDE IT IN CANADA? IT'S THE SAME MODEL VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S IN CANADA OR THE US AND I FEEL QUITE CONFIDENT THAT CANADA'S ROAD SALT USAGE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MINNESOTA'S. AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT MY VEHICLE HAS THIS ISSUE AND THAT THE 2013 MODELS WERE INCLUDED WITH THIS CAMPAIGN FOR SELECT US STATES. SO IF YOU COULD ADD THE 2014 ALTIMAS IN THE US TO THIS CAMPAIGN/RECALL, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. I HAVE A VIDEO SHOWING THE ISSUES FROM WALSER NISSAN IF WOULD BE HELPFUL.  PLEASE ADVISE.

I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS.  I HAD TO PUT A DATE ON THIS BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE LAST YEAR.

THEY HAVE ALSO REFUSED TO COVER THE EXPENSE OF OUR FAILURE, WHICH TOTALS NEARLY $1800 INCLUDING A RENTAL CAR.

I BOUGHT MY CAR NEW IN FEBRUARY OF 2014.    1) MY FIRST TRANSMISSION DIED NOV 2016 AFTER ONLY 50K MILES. I WAS AT A RED LIGHT AND MY CAR WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD, IT KEPT DYING AS SOON AS I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. THE CAR WAS STRANDED IN STREET UNTIL A TOW TRUCK CAME.  2) THE TRANSMISSION IT GOT REPLACED WITH DOES NOT DRIVE SMOOTHLY - IT JERKS, IT GOES TO HIGH RPM'S FOR NO REASON. WHEN I AM IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, IT SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF IT'S OWN: WHEN I AM BRAKING, I FEEL A PULL AS IF THE CAR DOES NOT WANT TO STOP. OR SOMETIMES THE ENGINE WILL FEEL LIKE IT'S REVVING HARDER THAN I NEED IT TO (UP TO 4-5K RPMS WHEN GOING UNDER 25MPH).  3) THIS TRANSMISSION HAS STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES AT A RED LIGHT. I WILL TRY TO ACCELERATE, AND IT WON'T MOVE. IT FINALLY BEGINS TO GO AFTER 3-5 SECONDS OF STALLING. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL IT DIES COMPLETELY, AS MY PREVIOUS TRANSMISSION DID FOR THIS CAR.  4) I WAS CRUISING ON A SIDE STREET ONCE, GOING AROUND 40-45MPH, AND SUDDENLY THE RPM'S SHOOT UP TO 4-5 FOR NO REASON (USUALLY CRUISE BETWEEN 1-2). I PUT MY FOOT COMPLETELY OFF THE GAS, AND IT WOULD NOT STOP. IT FINALLY DID AFTER ABOUT 3-5 SECONDS.    I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR- ANYTIME I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, I AM WONDERING IF MY CAR IS GOING TO DIE IN THE MIDDLE OF MY TURN, AND IF I AM GOING TO GET T-BONED. I'VE COMPLAINED TO MY DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES (TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS), AND THEY ALWAYS SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT. SEARCH ONLINE AND YOU WILL SEE THE MANY COMPLAINS ABOUT NISSAN'S CVT TRANSMISSION. WITH ONLY 65K MILES ON A CAR I BOUGHT NEW, WE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING TO DEAL WITH SUCH A FAULTY TRANSMISSION. AND NISSAN WON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THEIR TRANSMISSIONS ARE FAULTY.",

BECAUSE THEY CAN NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WHEN THE CAR IS THERE THE ONLY THING THEY SAY THEY CAN DO IS A ZERO POINT RESET ON OCS SYSTEM.  THAT HAS NOT STOPPED THIS ISSUE FROM REOCCURRING.  WE HAVE PHONED BERGSTROM OF OSHKOSH 5 DAYS THIS WEEK, THEY DO NOT RETURN OUR CALL.   THE LAST  DIAGNOSIS STATES ELECTRICAL, HOWEVER, TONY THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD US THE LAST TIME WE WERE THEIR THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO THROW MONEY AT THE CAR IT COULD BE A SENSOR, ELECTRICAL, THE AIR BAG SYSTEM OR THE SEAT.  BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM WHEN WE ARE THERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO FIX, SO CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING.  THE RECALL ON THE CAR WAS DONE 5/26/16.  HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR HAS REPEATEDLY SAID IT IS BECAUSE THE PASSENGER IS NOT SITTING ON THE SEAT CORRECTLY, HOWEVER THE LAST TIME IT OCCURRED THE PASSENGER WAS SITTING IN THE SAME POSITION WHEN THE AIR BAG WAS OFF AS SHE WAS WHEN THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF AND RESTARTED CORRECTING THE PROBLEM.  OUR WARRANTY WILL RUN OUT SOON.  WE PHONED NISSAN AND THEY WILL ONLY GO BY WHAT THERE AUTO TECH AT BERGSTROM TELLS THEM, SO NO HELP THERE EITHER.  I HAVE COPIES OF INVOICES FROM WHEN THE CAR WAS TAKEN IN FOR THIS PROBLEM.",

AS YOU ARE AWARE, A RECALL WAS ISSUED AND HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON MY VEHICLE.  MY ISSUE IS THAT THE PASSENGER SEAT WON'T ARM THE AIRBAG IF MY WIFE SITS IN THE SEAT.  I HAVE MULTIPLE VIDEOS OF THIS ISSUE.  MY MOST RECENT VISIT TO MY NISSAN DEALER RESULTED IN THEM STATING THEY COULDN'T FIX ANYTHING AS THEY COULDN'T PULL AN ERROR CODE.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, THE ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN WITH MY WIFE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND AGAIN I RECORDED IT.  I OPENED A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN CORPORATE.  AFTER A FRUSTRATING PHONE CALL THIS EVENING, AND A LOT OF AMBITIOUS DOUBLE TALK ON NISSAN'S PART, THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE ISSUE WAS THAT MY WIFE WAS TOO LITE.  MY WIFE WEIGHS BETWEEN 103 AND 108 POUNDS AS SHE FLUCTUATES A BIT.  SHE STANDS 5 FOOT 3 INCHES TALL.  THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE, DELISA SAID THAT NISSAN DOESN'T RECOMMEND ANYONE UNDER 4 FEET 9 INCHES OR LESS THAN 120 LBS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THIS WAS NEVER TOLD TO ME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT PURCHASING THE CAR, OR THROUGH ANY OF THE 6-8 SERVICE TICKETS I HAVE OPENED REGARDING THIS ISSUE WITH MULTIPLE DIFFERENT FIXES ATTEMPTED.  ( I CAN GET THE EXACT NUMBER AS SOON AS MY DEALER PROVIDES THE REQUESTED INFORMATION.)  I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THE CAR KNOWING MY WIFE COULDN'T RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  I ASKED FOR THIS IN WRITING FROM THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE BUT SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT PROVIDE THAT.  SHE SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR THEIR INTERNAL RECORDS.  I PRESSED HER ON THE FACT THAT THEY WERE SAYING MY WIFE COULDN'T SIT IN THE FRONT SEAT.  HER REPLY WAS THAT SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT, ONLY THAT NISSAN DOESN'T RECOMMEND SOMEONE LESS THAN 120 POUNDS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE CONTACTED BY THE NHTSA TO CLARIFY WHAT NISSAN IS SAYING AND IF IT IS ACCURATE?",

THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AND THAT WAS WHEN ALL OF MY TROUBLES BEGAN.     THE VEHICLE WOULD HESITATE AND JERK WHILE DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS. THERE WAS NOW A VIBRATION AT 1.5 RPM. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS ADVISED THAT A BELT WAS LOOSE.    THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME AND IT STILL WAS NOT DRIVING SMOOTHLY AND NOW THE ENTIRE GEAR CONSOLE WAS LOOSE. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE FROM EITHER DRIVE OR REVERSE UPON STARTING, EVEN WHEN THE GEAR SHIFT WAS MOVED. IT WOULD TAKE TWO TRIES EACH TIME TO GET THE CAR TO MOVE FROM PARK.     THE VEHICLE WENT BACK INTO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE GEAR CONSOLE WAS ADJUSTED. HOWEVER, THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE - VEHICLE NOT MOVING WHEN GEAR PLACED IN REVERSE OR DRIVE.    THIS WEEKEND (4/30/16) I DROVE THE VEHICLE IN VIRGINIA AND HAD TO NAVIGATE SEVERAL HIGH ELEVATIONS WHILE ON THE I-81 HIGHWAY. THE CAR WAS SLUGGISH AT BEST, DRAGGING AND THE GEARS WOULD NOT CHANGE. THE CAR WAS RACING LOUDLY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE SPEED, RPM WAS UP AT 3.5 AND THE CAR WAS AT 50 MLES; SPEED LIMIT WAS 70. ONCE I CLEARED THE HILL THE RPMS LEVELED OUT TO 1.5 AND THE CAR HELD THE 70 MPH SPEED.     NOTE THE VEHICLE WAS NOT PERFORMING THIS WAY BEFORE THE \"NEW TRANSMISSION\" WAS INSTALLED. I DID HAVE THE GRINDING AND RACING NOISE AT 2.0 RPM, BUT NO HESITATION, JERKING OR ANY DIFFICULTIES IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THAT LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE OTHER THAN THE TRANSMISSION.    I HAVE ALSO LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHOM I AM AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM ON MY COMPLAINT.    THE VEHICLE NOW HAS 18,694 MILES AND WAS PURCHASED IN AUGUST OF 2014.",

I WENT FROM PULLING OFF SLOWLY, TO WHEN I DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR IT WOULDN'T GO AT ALL UNTIL I KEPT PUTTING THE CAR IN PARK, THEN DRIVE, THEN PARK, THEN DRIVE MANY TIMES UNTIL IT DECIDED TO DRIVE.

THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING IS TO PULL OVER AND RESTART THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENCE.

THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT WAS ON 2/8/15, WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS.  I QUICKLY SCHEDULED A SERVICE APPT FOR 2/12/15 & REFUSED TO LET ANYONE IN THE FRONT SEAT.  WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 2/12/15, THE NISSAN SERVICE ADVISOR DISCUSSED WITH ME A TSB, WHICH SAID THAT \"OCCUPANTS WHO ARE PROPERLY SEATED AND CORRECTLY USING THE SEAT BELT, SHOULD NOT CAUSE THE PASSENGER AIR BAG TO BE AUTOMATICALLY TURNED OFF.\"  HE THEN HAD THE CARE INSPECTED BY A SERVICE TECH.  FOLLOWING THE INSPECTION, THE SERVICE ADVISOR CAME TO ME AND NOTED THAT THE SYSTEM WAS NOT SHOWING ANY TROUBLE CODES.  THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND TO LET THEM KNOW IF I HAD ANYMORE TROUBLE.

SEPARATE ISSUE: NAVIGATION / AUDIO SYSTEM HAS FROZEN SCREEN UPON START UP AND BECOMES UN RESPONSIVE. NO ABILITY TO CHANGE PREVIOUS VOLUME LEVEL OF RADIO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT AT HIGH VOLUME LEVEL DURING PREVIOUS DRIVE. INPUT IS NOT ACCEPTED ON HEAD UNIT OR STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS. NAVIGATION WILL NOT INITIATE. CAR MUST BE RESTARTED FOR SYSTEM TO REBOOT AND THIS MAY REMEDY THE PROBLEM FOR ONE DRIVE CYCLE OR MORE. HAS OCCURRED 5 OR MORE TIMES IN FIRST MONTH OF OWNERSHIP.    SHOULD A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN THE DRIVE TRAIN OCCUR, I FEEL THAT I AM AT RISK OF SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY. ADDITIONALLY I AM CONCERNED THAT RESALE VALUE OF VEHICLE WILL BE DIMINISHED DUE TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY INHERENT DESIGN FLAW IN POWER TRAIN AND IN-CAR ELECTRONICS.  *TR",
