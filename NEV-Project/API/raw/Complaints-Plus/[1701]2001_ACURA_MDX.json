The Acura dealership in Fort Worth, Texas indicated that the recalled part was replaced, however, this issue has re-occurred or was not properly fixed in the first instance. This is likely due to a replacement of the same defective transmission part. I have requested the Acura dealership to look at the transmission as it relates to the recall (recall number 04V17600). Although they are aware that this is the issue, they refuse to redress the problem. They state that I will need to pay for an entire new transmission. This is an issue with the Acura components and not a problem caused by the driver. Acura should be required to fix the issue. They are making the road unsafe for drivers at the driver's expense.",

ABOUT A WEEK AGO WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT DOWN THE INTERSTATE AT 65 MPH WITH MY CRUISE CONTROL SET MY RPM WENT UP TO 5000 SO I TAPPED ON BREAK WHICH MADE IT GO BACK DOWN TO NORMAL, SO I WENT TO ACCELERATE BACK UP TO SPEED AND NOTHING HAPPENED OTHER THEN IT ACTING AS THOUGH I WAS DRIVING IN NEUTRAL AND THEN IT WAS FINE AGAIN FOR A SPLIT SECOND SO I TURNED MY HAZARDS ON AND SLOWED DOWN MORE AND PULLED OFF INTO GAS STATION TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND NOTICED ATF ALL OVER THE PLACE THE GROUND WAS COVERED. I HAD TO GET TRAILER TO GET IT HOME, ONCE I DID I PULLED OUT MY CHILTON'S HANDBOOK FOR IT TO SEE IF COULD FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE WAS AND IT SHOWS THAT THE 2001 HAS A RECALL ON THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, BUT WHEN I GET ONLINE IT ONLY SHOWS THE RECALL IF I PUT IN 2001 ACURA MDX IT DOESN'T SHOW IT WITH MY VIN.

VEHICLE CAN ACCELERATE THROUGH THE GRINDING/RUMBLING BY FURTHER DEPRESSING ACCELERATOR AND SOMETIMES ACCELERATES THROUGH THE 20-30 MPH RANGE WITHOUT NOTICEABLE GRINDING/RUMBLING. IF, HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE IS ACCELERATING SLOWLY AND IT DOES BEGIN TO GRIND/RUMBLE, MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT SPEED/RPM LEVEL (WITHOUT DRASTIC CHANGE IN ROAD SURFACE OR GRADE THAT WOULD CAUSE COMPUTER TO CHANGE GEAR DUE TO INCREASED/DECREASED FRICTION) THE DRIVER CAN CREATE A CONTINUED DURATION OF THE GRINDING/RUMBLING UNTIL RELEASING OF FURTHER DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR TO CHANGE OUT OF THAT GEAR/RPM/SPEED/LOAD COMBINATION WHICH RESULTS IN THE GRINDING/RUMBLING DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ONCE THE VEHICLE ACCELERATES ABOVE AROUND 45 MPH, MORE CONSISTENTLY AT SPEEDS ABOVE 50 MPH, ON LEVEL TERRAIN AT CONSISTENT SPEED VIA ACCELERATOR OR CRUISE-CONTROLLED, THE VEHICLE WILL FREQUENTLY INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY 200-300 RPM AND BEGIN TO MAKE A WHIRRING SOUND WHICH LASTS A FEW SECONDS THEN THE RPM RETURN TO PREVIOUS SPEED AND THE WHIRRING SUBSIDES.

THE SEATS ARE DESIGNED TO WARM THE SEAT CUSHION AND THE LUMBAR CUSHION OF BOTH FRONT DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER SEATS. CURRENTLY, THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WORKS AS DESIGNED. THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT, HOWEVER, ONLY HEATS THE LUMBAR CUSHION WHEN THE HEATER IS ENGAGED AND THE SEAT CUSHION DOES NOT HEAT. WHILE CLEANING THE VEHICLE I NOTICED WHITE RUBBER UNDERNEATH THE DRIVER SEAT. THE RUBBER LOOKED LIKE WIRE INSULATION AND SOME OF THE PIECES LOOKED TO BE CHARRED. I SUSPECT THAT THE HEATING ELEMENT COULD HAVE BROKEN OR SHORTED SOMEHOW CAUSING THE WIRE INSULATION TO CRACK AND OVER TIME TO DISINTEGRATE.    MY CONCERN IS THAT A BREAK IN THE HEATING ELEMENT AND/OR CIRCUITRY COULD RESULT IN A SHORT OR SPARK OR EVEN A FIRE WHICH COULD CAUSE HARM TO THE DRIVER IF SITTING IN THAT SEAT WERE SUCH AN EVENT TO OCCUR AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE A HAZARDOUS SITUATION IF SUCH AN EVENT OCCURRED EN ROUTE WHERE A DRIVER'S REACTION TO SHOCK, SMOKE, BURNING SMELL, OR FIRE COULD ENDANGER THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS, AND OTHER VEHICLES/PASSENGERS ON THE ROAD. EVEN IF THE VEHICLE IS USED WITHOUT INTENTIONALLY ENGAGING THE SEAT HEATING SYSTEM, THE DESIGN AND LOCATION OF THE ROCKER SWITCHES ALLOW THEM TO EASILY BE ENGAGED INADVERTENTLY.",

THE MECHANIC ASKED ME TO DRIVE IT AT 28 MPH SO THAT IT WAS AROUND 1500 RPMS.  IT MADE THE NOISE NUMEROUS TIMES FOR HIM AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE SAID IT WAS THE TORQUE CONVERTER AND IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I'VE HAD MY 2001 MDX FOR 3 YRS AND IT'S NOT UNDER WARRANTY SO WE REPLACED THE TORQUE CONVERTER TO A TUNE OF $2,400.  I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY AFTER SEEING SO MANY TORQUE CONVERTERS AND TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS ON THIS WEBSITE AND OTHER COMPLAINT WEBSITES.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL AND IT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.  I WON'T BE BUYING AN ACURA OR HONDA EVER AGAIN.",

ON 1/23/2009, WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT THE HIGHWAY AT 60 MPH, THE CAR HAS ABRUPTLY STOPPED TO LOW 30 MPH AND ALMOST CAUSED A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT TO MY FAMILY. THE CAR DIDN'T HAVE ANY WARNING LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD CONSOLE PRIOR TO THE FAILURE. THE CAR HAS 148,000 MILES AND IT'S IN A GOOD MECHANICAL STANDING (WITH REGULAR INTERVAL MAINTENANCE).  SINCE THEN, I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS VEHICLE IS KNOWN TO PRODUCE SUCH SYMPTOM. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE VEHICLE TRANSMISSION HAS DESIGN ISSUE AT ITS BEGINNING, AND AT HIGH MILEAGE, IT MIGHT EXACERBATE MORE SEVERELY. SHOULD NHTSA REGULATE ACURA TO CONCERN MORE FOR THE SAFETY OF ITS CUSTOMERS? ACTION THAT ACURA CAN HELP COULD BE AS ISSUES NEW ERRATA BULLETINS OR COURTEOUS ACCIDENT PREVENTIVE MEASUREMENT TO MAKE ITS OLDER(HIGH MILEAGE) CAR SAFE.  I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT TO ACURA BUT DIDN'T THINK IT HAS ANY USE. FOR ONE THING THAT ACURA FACTORY WON'T MAKE ITS CUSTOMER SAFE IS TO COLLECT ACTUAL OLDER HIGH MILEAGE FAILURE TRANSMISSION AND INVESTIGATE FOR PREVENTIVE SAFETY MEASUREMENT. ACURA SHOWED NO INTEREST DESPITE MY EFFORT IN TALKING TO THEM. I HAVE DRIVEN CARS WITH FAILURE TRANSMISSION, BUT HAVE NOT EXPERIENCE ONE THAT LOCKS UP AT HIGH SPEED IN HIGHWAY. THIS TYPE OF FAILURE SYMPTOM IS TOTALLY NOT ACCEPTABLE. SURPRISINGLY, I WAS ABLE TO FIND REPORT OF MANY MDX TRANSMISSION LOCKUP CASES ON WEB. SHOULD THERE BE LAW TO PREVENT HIGH MILEAGE UNSAFE MDX GO RIDE ON HIGHWAY UNLESS SOME SAFETY INSPECTION HAS BEEN PERFORMED. AND, THIS IS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS.  I AM CURRENTLY HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED AT MY OWN EXPENSE. *TR",

THE FIRST RECALL WAS DONE AT 35,000 MILES FOR THE FRONT SPRINGS AND THEN AT 39,000 MILES FOR THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING ISSUE.  ON MARCH 17,2006 I WAS TRAVELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHEN I COMPLETELY LOST ALL POWER TO MY VEHICLE AND HAVE TO SWERVE OFF THE ROAD TO AVOID GETTING HIT.  I WAS QUITE SCARED.  AFTER PULLING OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I GOT OUT OF MY VEHICLE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG EXTERNALLY AND THERE WASN'T, BUT I NOTICED THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD COME ON.  I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT INTO MY DEALER AND HAD THEN CHECK THE CAR OVER.  THEY STATED THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT INDICATED A TOTAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS TYPE OF THING WAS COMMON IN THESE CARS AND THAT THE RECALL WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX THE ISSUE.  APPARENTLY IT HASN'T.  AT 77,000 MILES MY TRANSMISSION FAILED AND ACURA WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.  THEIR HEADQUARTERS HAVE STATED THAT THE TWO PROBLEMS, THE RECALL AND MY TRANSMISSION ISSUE ARE UNRELATED.  AFTER DOING A CONSIDER AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I'VE NOTICED THESE CARS ARE KNOWN FOR TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND THAT A TOTAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE CAN RESULT BECAUSE THE RECALL WAS NOT DONE PROPERLY OR BECAUSE THE RECALL DIDN'T CATCH THE PROBLEM IN EARLY ENOUGH.  MY PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR WAS DRIVEN 40,000 MILES BEFORE THE RECALL WAS DONE AND DURING THAT TIME SOME DAMAGE HAD TO HAVE BEEN DONE TO THE TRANSMISSION TO WARRANT THIS TRANSMISSION.  MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE??  ACURA WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CAR BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY DEFECT IN THERE VEHICLES.

THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.    THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS AT LOW SPEEDS UNDER LIGHT THROTTLE RESPONSE.  THIS HESITATION DOES NOT HAPPEN AT HALF OR FULL THROTTLE.         I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THIS FLAW MAY BE PART OF THE VEHICLE DESIGN THAT WAS FIXED ON THE 2004 MODEL YEAR.

WHYS:  I ALMOST DID NOT REPORT THIS BECAUSE I WAS STUPID AND FORGOT TO SET THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IN DALLAS, WHO OWNS A 2001 ACCURA MDX, HAD A SIMILAR THING HAPPEN TO HIM (WITHOUT INJURY) A FEW MONTHS EARLIER WHEN HIS EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS SET; HE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT TO ME UNTIL HE HEARD ABOUT MY ACCIDENT.  I WOULD LOVE TO BE THE LAST PERSON THAT AN MDX FALLS ON.    BOTH MY BROTHER-IN-LAW AND I HAD DECIDED TO CHANGE OUR OWN TIRES AS WE HAD FLATS IN OUR DRIVEWAYS (BOTH OF US HAVE CHANGED MANY FLATS IN THE PAST, ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I HAD DONE SO), WERE IN A SAFE, LEVEL, AND DRY PLACE, AND HAD NO NEED TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD MAKE THE SAME CHOICE IN THAT SITUATION, OR, MORE HAZARDOUSLY, ALONG A ROADSIDE (WHERE THE ROAD'S CROWN MAKES THE GROUND UNEVEN, AND WHERE PASSING TRAFFIC WILL SHAKE A CAR).    MY BROTHER-IN-LAW'S 2001 MDX SHIFTED (EVEN WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON) AND BENT THE JACK, BUT DID NOT FALL ALL THE WAY OFF OF IT.  HE CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  WHEN THE R.A. MAN ARRIVED TO HELP, HE LOOKED AT THE JACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS WAY TOO SMALL FOR A CAR AS HEAVY AS AN MDX.    MY JACK ALSO BENT.  ALTHOUGH MY EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS OFF, THE CAR DID NOT ROLL OR SHIFT WHEN MY NEIGHBOR CAME OVER WITH A LARGER JACK TO RE-RAISE MY CAR AND INSTALL THE PASSENGER TIRE FOR ME. (AT THAT POINT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS NOT SET).  I WAS  NEGLIGENT, BUT MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS NOT; THIS JACK MAY BE DANGEROUS WHEN SUPPORTING THIS CAR.  WILL YOU PLEASE FOLLOW UP ON THIS?  *AK",

AS IT TURNS OUT, DESPITE PREVIOUS WARNINGS, HE WAS PLAYING WITH THAT MIDDLE SHOULDER STRAP AND INADVERTANTLY IT LOOPED AROUND HIS NECK, RETRACTED AND BEGAN TO HANG AND STRANGLE HIM.  HE CALLED OUT TO ME WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN A CRYING, RASPY VOICE.  I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE CAR AND LOOKED BACK. I AM AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN, AND WHAT I SAW WAS MY SON BEING LIFTED OFF THE SEAT, BEING HELD DOWN BY HIS SEAT WHILE HIS HEAD WAS BEING PULLED AWAY. HIS FACE WAS RED AND HE COULD HARDLY BREATH AND HIS BREATHING WAS GETTING MORE LABORED. I JUMPED IN THE BACK SEAT AND TRIED TO PULL THE SHOULDER STRAP DOWN TO GIVE HIME SOME SLACK, BUT IT WAS LOCKED. HE MUST HAVE PULLED IN OUT ALL THE WAY PRIOR TO THE SEAT BELT RETRACTING, AND IT WAS LOCKED. I HAD TO RELEASE HIS BELT AND HOLD HIM UP WITH MY HAND. I COULD NOT PLACE MY FINGER BETWEEN THE BELT AND HIS NECK BECAUSE IT WAS TOO TIGHT, AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO UNWRAP THE BELT. I LOOKED DOWN AT THE LOCKING MECHANISM. THERE IS A WAY OF UNLOCKING THE MIDDLE SEAT BELT AND RETRACTING IT ALL THE WAY INTO THE ROOF FOR STORAGE, IN MY PANIC I COULD OT IDENTIFY IT. I CALLED OUTSIDE TO PEOPLE IN THEIR CARS PARKED AT A STOP LIGHT FOR A KNIFE. NO ONE HAD A KNIFE. I WENT BACK AND THOUGHT AGAIN AND REMEMBERED THAT A KEY WAS REQUIRED TO UNLACTCH THIS MECHANISM. I TOOK MY KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION, AND FOUND A SMALL RECTANGULAR HOLE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BUCKLE MECHANISM, PLACED MY KEY INTO IT AND RELEASED THE BELT. I WAS ABLE TO THEN UNWRAP THE BELT FROM THIS NECK AND SAVE  HIS LIFE. IF I HAND NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN AWARE OF THIS MECHANISM, HE WOULD HAVE HUNG/STRANGLED TO DEATH. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS.
