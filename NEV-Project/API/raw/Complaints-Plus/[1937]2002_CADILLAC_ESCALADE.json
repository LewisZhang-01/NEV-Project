A QUICK INSPECTION FOUND MISSING AND RUSTED EXHAUST MANIFOLD BOLTS ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF MY ENGINE, CAUSING AN EXHAUST LEAK. THIS LEAK CREATES NOT ONLY A DANGEROUS CO2 LEAK WITHIN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT (WHICH ALSO CAN BE DRAWN INTO THE CABIN'S HVAC SYSTEM), BUT IT ALSO RAISES ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, AS THE LEAKING EXHAUST IS NOT BEING PROPERLY TREATED VIA THE VEHICLE'S CATALYTIC CONVERTER. MY PASSENGER SIDE MANIFOLD ALSO HAS RUSTED BOLTS AND IS VERY CLOSE TO HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AS THE DRIVER SIDE.     MY TRUCK IS IMPECCABLY MAINTAINED, WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE SERVICE RECORDS. THIS ISSUE IS WELL DOCUMENTED ACROSS THE INTERNET, WITH OWNERS OF 1999-2006 ESCALADES, TAHOES, SUBURBANS, YUKON/XLS, SILVERADOS AND SIERRAS.      I STRONGLY URGE THE NHTSA TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE MASSIVE FAILURE OF MANIFOLDS AND MANIFOLD BOLTS ON 1999-2006 GM FULL SIZE SUV AND PICKUP TRUCKS.

I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND FOUND THAT THIS IS QUITE A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS CAR AS MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE REPORTED IT. SUBSEQUENTLY THEREAFTER THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RE-OCCURRING AND I BROUGHT IT TO MY LOCAL CADILLAC DEALER.  I TOLD THE SERVICE CENTER WHAT MY RESEARCH FOUND AND BECAUSE A COMPUTER SCAN DID NOT EVEN PICK UP THE ISSUE THEY DECIDED T IT MIGHT BE DUE TO THE ABS SENSORS BEING DIRTY ALSO THE SERVICE CENTER REPRESENTATIVE AND MECHANIC BOTH SAID TO ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THIS ISSUE A NUMBER OF TIMES.  THEY CLEANED OFF THIS ABS SENSOR AT WHICH TIME A TEST REVEALED THAT ONE OF THE SENSORS WAS READING IMPROPERLY.  SO THEY SAID TO REPAIR IT I NEED TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY ON THAT SIDE.  AFTER THEY CHANGED THAT SIDE AND AFTER ANOTHER TEST DRIVE THE ISSUE STILL RECURRED.  THIS TIME THEY SAID MAYBE WE NEED TO CHANGE THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING THE OTHER WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY TO SEE IF THE ISSUE IS CORRECTED.  THE COST FOR REPAIRS IS WELL OVER $1200.

INITIALLY I THOUGHT THAT IT MAY BE THE BRAKE SHOES OR ROTORS, HOWEVER, I HAVE HAD THE BRAKE SHOES AND ROTORS REPLACED ON THE FRONT AND BACK OF THE VEHICLE.  THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKING HAVE PERSISTED.  THE ABS IS TRIGGERED WHEN DRIVEN AT LOW SPEEDS USUALLY UNDER 15 MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE CONDITIONS DO NOT WARRANT IT.  CONSEQUENTLY, I HAVE ALMOST WRECKED DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE OPERATION OF THE BRAKES AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND CONCERNED WITH THE SAFETY OF MY WIFE AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN.       I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A DEALERSHIP THAT POTENTIALLY THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM INVOLVES THE FRONT, WHEEL SPEED SENSOR MOUNTING SURFACE ON THE BEARING.  SUPPOSEDLY RUST OR CORROSION COULD DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT THE PEAK-TO-PEAK OUTPUT VOLTAGE.  THE WHEEL BEARING HUB ASSEMBLY SENSOR PROBLEM CAUSES FALSE WHEEL SPEED READINGS WHICH SENDS ERRONEOUS WHEEL SPEED READINGS TO THE VEHICLE''S COMPUTER.  THE COMPUTER INTERPRETS THIS READING AS A NEED FOR THE COMPUTER TO CONTINUE ACTIVATING THE ABS TO PREVENT WHEEL LOCKUP.  HOWEVER, IF ABS IS STILL TRIGGERING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS, IT PREVENTS THE WHEELS FROM COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP BECAUSE IT CONTINUALLY RELEASES AND APPLIES THE BRAKES AT VERY LOW SPEEDS (UNDER 15 MILES AN HOUR).
