        "summary": "My jetta stalls without warning when the gas gauge is at a quarter of a tank or less. No engine check light or any other any other device comes on to warn me it is going to stall.   My speed does not matter. It happens at freeway speeds or around town. It does not occur if the gas gauge shows more than 1/4 of a tank of fuel.  I do not know if it is an electrical problem, a fuel propulsion problem or an engine problem.   From reading volkswagon forums, this is a very common problem with volkswagons of different years, including the new Tiguans.   I'm sure there have been many fatalities as a result of this defect. I am surprised volkswagon has not been forced to repair this dangerous, life threatening problem before now!   Maybe, a class action law suit involving products liability, merchantability, and fitness for a particular use would benefit not only owners, but the general public at large.   I believe it is your duty to protect the general public from manufactures who place dangerous, defective products in the stream of commerce. Your action is required, and demanded.  The first time ocurred right after I purchased the car in 2019. It has stalled many times since then, before I realized I needed to keep the fuel tank at least 1/2 full at all times.  Keeping it 1/2 full at all times greatly deminishes the range of travel before I have to refill.   It is inconvenient and expensive since fuel has to be purchased at places other the most economical place I usually purchase my gasoline.  Thank you",

THE MECHANIC'S DIAGNOSIS OF THE PROBLEM WAS A PARTIALLY MELTED FUSE PACK, THAT SITS ON TOP OF THE BATTERY, AND AN OVERLY RESISTIVE CABLE BETWEEN THE FUSE PACK AND THE ALTERNATOR.  THE SOLUTION WAS: THE CABLE END LINKED TO THE FUSE PACK WAS RE-TERMINATED, AND THE MELTED FUSE PACK WAS REPLACED.  BETWEEN THE TOW AND THE REPAIR, IT SET ME BACK ABOUT $300.00.

THE DRIVER SIDE HEATER COIL WAS RECALLED BACK IN 2007 AND HAD BEEN REPLACED THROUGH THE RECALL, HOWEVER, THE REPLACEMENT PART IS FAULTY AS WELL.  THIS TIME,  THE HEATER COIL HAS BURNED THE LEATHER SEAT AND BURNED A HOLE IN MY NORTH FACE DOWN COAT. LUCKILY THE COAT IS THICK SO I DID NOT GET BADLY BURNED.  I HAD CONTACTED VOLKSWAGEN DIRECTLY AFTER THIS ASSUMING THEY WOULD REPLACE THE HEATED  SEAT COIL  SINCE THE INITIAL REPLACEMENT FROM THE RECALL WAS BAD, THEY WERE NOT HELPFUL AND SAID THE CAR WAS PAST WARRANTY.  WHICH IT WAS BY ABOUT 3 MONTHS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE SITUATION OF A PRIOR RECALL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE PART WITH ANOTHER BAD PART, I EXPECTED MORE FROM THE COMPANY.  I THEN WENT TO MY DEALER WHO CHARGED ME $120 \"DIAGNOSTIC FEE\" TO TELL ME THE HEAT SEATER IS FAULTY.  THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT UP WITH VOLKSWAGEN.  A SECOND CALL AND EMAIL TO VOLKSWAGEN LEAD NO WHERE. THIS IS A DANGEROUS ISSUE AND REPLACEMENT OF ONE BAD PART WITH ANOTHER BAD PART IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.  I SEE THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS ACTIVE ON THIS SAME MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR CAR. I WOULD LIKE A CREDIT FOR MY DIAGNOSTIC FEE WHICH ANYONE COULD SEE WAS A FAULTY SEAT BASED ON THE BURN, AND I EXPECT VOLKSWAGEN TO PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT SEAT COVER AND PAD AND BOLSTER HEATERS AS THE SEAT IS NOT USABLE AS IS AND IF IT IS USED CREATES A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  *TT",

THE DEALERSHIP STATED IT WAS NOT UNDER THE MANUFACTURES WARRANTY AND WOULD COST AT LEAST $900 TO CLEAN OUT THE ENGINE. UPON DECIDING TO TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC FOR A 2ND OPINION, THE CAR SEIZED UP AND CEASED TO WORK WHILE DRIVING.  THE MECHANIC  INFORMED ME THAT THE ENTIRE ENGINE WAS BLOWN FROM THE SLUDGE BUILD UP WHEN OIL CHANGES HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT 3,000 MILE INTERVALS THOUGH THE MANUFACTURES OWNERS MANUAL STATED IT ONLY HAD TO BE CHANGED EVERY 5,000 MILES.  THE DEALERSHIP STATED THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT OTHER THAN FOR ME TO PURCHASE A NEW ENGINE OR A REBUILT ENGINE.  AFTER HAVING A USED ENGINE INSTALLED FROM A SALVAGE YARD, I DISCOVERED FROM THE CAR POURING SMOKE AND MAKING A HIGH PITCHED WHINING NOISE. APPARENTLY WHEN THE ORIGINAL ENGINE WENT IT ALSO DAMAGED THE TURBO AS A RESULT OF SLUDGE BUILD UP. I'VE FURTHER DISCOVERED AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM TO VW CARS WITH 1.8 LITER TURBO ENGINES FROM MODELS FOLLOWING 2000. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE TURBO IS CONSIDERED AN ACCESSORY TO THE ENGINE, THE TURBO WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE SALVAGE YARDS ENGINE WARRANTY I JUST HAD INSTALLED AND WOULD REQUIRE THE TURBO BEING REPLACED AS WELL.

UPON RE-INVESTIGATION OF THE CAR THE INSURANCE DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD NOW COVER THE DAMAGES THAT ARE ESTIMATED AT AROUND $5,000 BUT I HAVE A $500 DEDUCTIBLE AND MY PREMIUMS WILL NOW GO UP. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED RAILROAD TRACKS SHOULD NOT DEPLOY AIRBAGS AND I SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS RELATED. *TR",

I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH MY NEW VEHICLE IN LATE NOVEMBER 2005, WITH MILEAGE AT 47399.  I SUFFERED INTERMITTENT LOSS OF POWER WHEN ACCELERATING ONTO THE FREEWAY AND IN TRAVELING UP HILLS.  DURING THE LOSS OF POWER, I ALSO NOTICED THAT I COULD NOT HEAR THE WHINE OF THE TURBO AND ASSUMED THAT THE PROBLEM MUST BE RELATED TO MY TURBO.  THE CHICO DEALER TEST DROVE THE CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES WITH A SCAN TOOL BUT WAS UNABLE TO VERIFY MY COMPLAINT.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE PROBLEM WITH THE TURBO PERSISTED.  I BROUGHT MY CAR BACK TO THE CHICO DEALERSHIP ON JANUARY 7, 2006, WITH MILEAGE AT 50856.  ONCE AGAIN, THE CHICO DEALER WAS UNABLE TO VERIFY MY COMPLAINT BECAUSE THEIR SCAN TOOL DID NOT PULL A CODE.  THE CHICO DEALER STATED THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE MY COMPLAINT REGARDING THE LOSS OF POWER.  THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR WAS REPLACED BY THE CHICO DEALER ON JANUARY 7, 2006.    FEELING DEFEATED AND FRUSTRATED, I SUFFERED THROUGH THE TURBO PROBLEM FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  DURING THIS TIME, I WAS FORCED TO TAKE EXTRA SPECIAL PRECAUTION WHEN ENTERING THE FREEWAY IN CASE MY TURBO FAILED TO RESPOND UPON ACCELERATION.  IN ADDITION, WHEN I EXPERIENCED A LOSS POWER TRAVELING UP-HILL, I WAS FORCED TO UTILIZE MY HAZARD SIGNAL AND MOVE TO EITHER THE SLOW LANE OR THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD TO ALLOW OTHER VEHICLES TO PASS ME.  WHEN MY TURBO FAILED TO RESPOND PROPERLY, MY VEHICLE WOULD ONLY TRAVEL AT A MAXIMUM OF 45-55 MPH WHEN ACCELERATING ONTO THE FREEWAY AND 35-45 MPH WHEN TRAVELING UP-HILL.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, EVEN LARGE SEMI-TRUCKS PASSED ME TRAVELING UP-HILL.  THE PROBLEM WITH MY TURBO JEOPARDIZED MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY PASSENGERS' AS WELL AS THOSE TRAVELING AROUND US. THIS HAS GONE ON TOO LONG WITHOUT THE PROPER ATTENTION TO MY CONCERNS AND I FEEL UNSAFE WHILE TRAVELING IN MY VW.   *TR",

UPON THE THIRD FAILURE IN DECEMBER 2006 I ASKED IF MY VW DEALER COULD REPLACE ALL OF THE ORIGINAL IGNITION COILS, AS CLEARLY A PATTERN OF FAILURE WAS EVIDENT. THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO REPLACE COILS AS THEY FAILED AND THAT I COULD CONTACT VW TO VOICE MY CONCERN. I CONTACTED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REQUEST THAT THEY REPLACE THE REMAINING 3 COILS, TO AGAIN RECEIVE THE RESPONSE THAT THEY WILL REPLACE THE COILS AS THEY FAIL, BUT NOT PROACTIVELY. (AS LONG AS MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY.)    TODAY THE FOURTH IGNITION COIL FAILED AND I AM NOW OUTSIDE OF MY WARRANTY COVERAGE. (WARRANTY ENDED 2-28-07.) I CONTACTED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE TO FILE ANOTHER COMPLAINT AND WAS INSTRUCTED THAT I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS AS THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. UPON RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION, I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND FOUND NHTSA ACTION NUMBER DP05004, WHICH INDICATES THAT VW ISSUED CUSTOMER SERVICE CAMPAIGNS ON 1-31-03, 6-6-03, 12-03 AND 1-04 INSTRUCTING DEALERS TO REPLACE ALL IGNITION COIL PACKS IN MODEL YEAR 2000-2003 VOLKSWAGEN JETTAS.     UPON FINDING THIS INFORMATION, I CALLED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN TO SEE IF MY CAR WOULD BE COVERED AND WAS INFORMED THAT MY VIN WAS NOT COVERED BY THE CSC, AS CSC'S ARE VIN SPECIFIC, NOT MODEL/YEAR SPECIFIC.    I WOULD LIKE THE NHTSA TO RE-OPEN ACTION NUMBER DP05004.

WHEN THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH IS NOT WORKING IT CAUSES THE CRUISE CONTROL TO ALSO STOP WORKING.  WHAT I ALSO FOUND OUT IS THAT SINCE THIS SWITCH WAS BROKEN ALL MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING.

THE QUOTE TO REPAIR WAS APPROXIMATELY $6,000. THIS PROBLEM IS A LATENT DEFECT IN THE DESIGN. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UN-DRIVABLE UNTIL THE REPAIRS ARE MADE. THE SERVICE ADVISOR ALSO CONFIRMED THAT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE HARNESS ITSELF, ANY ELECTRICAL COMPONENT COULD BE AFFECTED SUCH AS THE AIRBAGS, ABS, SRS, ETC. ALSO, FROM MY OWN RESEARCH I FOUND SOME PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM HAVE ALSO HAD SMOKE OR FIRES INSIDE THE VEHICLE. VW ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (ID# C 97-01-01) FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE ON 1999.5 - 2001 MODEL YEAR JETTAS, BUT NEVER FOR THE 2003 AND NEVER A RECALL CAMPAIGN ON THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN. VW HAS REFUSED TO ASSIST IN THE COST OF REPAIR TO THE VEHICLE AS WELL. *NM",

I CONTACTED VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ALONG WITH MY VW DEALERSHIP (STRONG VW, SLC UT), AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I MUST BRING IT IN.  SEEING THAT I WAS BARELY GOING TO MAKE IT HOME I CONTACTED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WHICH WAS PROVIDED WITH MY JETTA AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY COULD TOW IT TO THE NEAREST VW DEALERSHIP (NOT WHERE I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED OR HAD MY CAR SERVICED) TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS ACTUALLY CLOSER FOR ME TO DROP OFF THE JETTA AT THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP RATHER THAN TAKE IT HOME, SO I DID THAT.  I FOUND OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING THAT THE IGNITION COILS WERE BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THAT WAS DONE UNDER WARRANTY AND APPARENTLY EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  THREE DAYS LATER, EACH AND EVERY TIME I STARTED MY JETTA A NOXIOUS SMELL WOULD FILL THE CABIN.  I REPORTED THIS TO MY ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP AND HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  AFTER 5 DAYS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS THEY INFORMED THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  IRONICALLY IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE.  MY MAJOR COMPLAINT IS THAT IN THE YEAR AND A HALF THAT I HAVE OWNED MY JETTA, I HAVE HAD IT IN FOR NON-TRADITIONAL OR NON-SCHEDULED SERVICE MORE THAN 3 TIMES.  MY MAJOR FEAR IS THAT WHEN THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL VW CUSTOMER FOR 20+ YEARS AND HAVEN'T HAD THIS MANY PROBLEMS WITH MY PREVIOUS 4 VW VEHICLES COMBINED.

AS POINTED OUT BY THE FIVE VW EMPLOYEES LISTED ABOVE, THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE IS STRONGLY PROTECTED AGAINST SUCH OCCURRENCES WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS OF HARD PLASTIC SHIELDS, ALL OF WHICH SHOW NO SIGN WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT OPINION OF FIVE VW EMPLOYEES, IT''S CLEAR, THAT THE FAILURE OF THE OIL FILTER CAP WAS DUE TO FAULTY SERVICE ON THE PART OF PACIFIC VW, AND WAS NOT DAMAGE DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES.  *NM",

I CLOSED THE HOOD AND WHILE STANDING AT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  I IMMEDIATELY RAN TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND DISCOVERED A SMALL FIRE IN THE FRONT SEAT.  I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF, TURNED THE DRIVER'S SIDE HEATED SEAT OFF, AND MANAGED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.    THIS HAS BEEN A VERY TRAUMATIC EVENT.  REFLECTING ON THE TYPICAL USAGE OF THE HEATED SEATS BY MYSELF, OR WORSE YET MY WIFE, THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC.

IT NOW HAS 56,700 MILES ON IT. (MOSTLY HIGHWAY) WHILE DRIVING ON 6/21/05, I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES AND THE BRAKES GOT MUSHY AND THEN GRABBED AND THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR IN A SUDDEN STOP. AS IT WAS STOPPING YOU HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE VEHICLE NOW HAD AIR BRAKES.  I DEPRESSED THE PEDAL AGAIN THE BRAKES LET UP. I WAS NEARLY REAR ENDED BY A TRUCK THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED. I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND CALLED THE GARAGE. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BRAKE BOOSTER. PRIOR TO THIS PROBLEM, WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AT 48,000 MILES, I HAD THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED. IT WAS IN BECAUSE SEVERAL TIMES I APPLIED THE BRAKES IN THE SNOW AND THE TIRES LOCKED UP. THIS VEHICLE HAS ANTI-LOCK BRAKES. AT THIS TIME THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES DID NOT WORK. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES. THE DEALERSHIP FOUND NO PROBLEMS. THEY CHECKED IT AND SAID ALL WAS OK. IT HAPPENED AGAIN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER I GOT IT OUT OF THE SHOP. MY CURRENT MECHANIC (ROBERTS AUTOMOTIVE) WHO SPECIALIZES IN VOLKSWAGENS MENTIONED THAT HE BELIEVES THAT TWO PROBLEMS ARE VERY LIKELY THE SAME PROBLEM. THE MECHANIC ([XXX] @ ROBERTS AUTOMOTIVE) ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE CALLED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP (AUTOHAUS OF LANCASTER, PA) FOR THE PART, AND HE WAS TOLD THEY REPLACED 8 OF THESE BRAKE BOOSTERS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. I ALSO TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT AUTOHAUS. DAVE TOLD ME THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL BRAKE BOOSTERS GO BAD ON THE TDI MODELS. THE VEHICLE IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF AUTOHAUS. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP HERE. THIS IS A DEFINITE SAFETY ISSUE. BY SHEER LUCK I WAS NOT HIT BY THAT TRUCK.

I TURNED MY DRIVER SIDE SEAT WARMER ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL, (5) AND IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES I FELT A SHARP PAIN ON THE BACKSIDE OF MY LEFT THIGH AND THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD STUNG ME AT FIRST.  I REPOSITIONED MYSELF IN THE SEAT, AND COULD SMELL SOMETHING BURNING.  I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW DARK BROWN SMOKE POURING FROM THE SEAT AND REALIZED THE SEAT WAS ACTUALLY BURNING ME.  I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE SEAT WARMER OFF, PULLED OVER, (AGAIN IN VERY BUSY TRAFFIC IN WATERTOWN, MA), AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO FIND A DARK BROWN, DIME-SIZED BURN MARK IN THE SEAT!!!  THE HEAT ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE SEAT AND BURNED A SMALL BROWN MARK INTO MY BLUE JEANS AND SUBSEQUENTLY, LEFT A SMALL WELT ON THE BACKSIDE OF MY THIGH.  I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR NOW BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE IF THERE ARE OTHER ELECTRICAL DEFECTS WITH THIS CAR THAT MAY PUT MY LIFE, AND MY PASSENGERS LIVES IN DANGER.

THE CAR IS AN AUTOMATIC AND WHEN LEAVING IT TO SIT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME I WOULD GET IN TO DRIVE THE CAR AND STARTING OUT WHEN SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR IT WOULD SLAM INTO GEAR. IT WAS ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE AND SCARY FELT AS IF THE CAR WAS GOING TO BOTTOM OUT. SO I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND BROUGHT IT IN FOR A CHECK, THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR SO I TOOK IT HOME AGAIN BUT THE PROBLEM  KEPT HAPPENING. SO AGAIN COME MARCH I BROUGHT IT BACK THIS TIME THEY HAD IT FOR A WHOLE WK AND AGAIN TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG, SO I BROUGHT IT HOME AGAIN AND AGAIN LATER ON NOT EVEN A WEEK LATER IT STARTED TO SHIFT LATE AGAIN SO I CALLED AGAIN THIS TIME THE SERVICE REP TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HE COULD DO FOR ME. I CALLED THE VW COMPANY AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE WAYI WAS DRIVING THE CAR \"I WAS AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVER\". I CALLED THE BBB AND OPENED UP A CLAIM AND NOW AGAIN THEY HAVE MY CAR AND I HAVE A RENTAL BUT AGAIN THEY ARE TELLING ME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. NEVER ONCE HAS ANYONE APOLIGIZED. NO AUTOMATIC SHOULD SLAM INTO GEAR WHEN DRIVING IT. THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO EVEN TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. ALL THEY KEEP DOING IT TURNING IT AROUND ON ME AS IF IT IS MY FAULT THE WAY I AM DRIVING THE CAR..  I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON MYVWLEMON.COM AND I HAVE FOUND A MILLION OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND INFORMED BARRYS OF THIS AND THEY TOLD ME UNLESS IT IS THE EXACT SAME CAR SAME ENGINE SAME STYLE THERE IS NO CASE.. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTLY THE WORST I HAVE EVER BEEN TREATED FROM A COMPANY.",

I TOOK THIS PROBLEM TO VW AND THE SAID THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE AN APPONTMENT BEFORE THEY WOULD HELP ME. SO I HAD TO DRIVE HOME WITH ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND MAKE MY APPT. THIS PROBLEM WAS FIXED HOWEVER OCCASIONALY THE BRAKE LIGHTS STILL STAY STUCK ON. THIS WAS ALSO NOTED TO VW. THE SECOND TIME I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR A RATTLE IN MY CLUTCH. I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED TO TAKE MY CAR ON A TEST DRIVE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP (?). SO I DID AND SHE STATED SHE DID NOT HERE ANYTHING AND I TOLD HERE THAT WHEN I TAKE THE CLUTCH OUT IT DOES RATTLES VERY LOUD BUT WHEN I PUSH THE CLUTCH IN THE RATTLE STOPS. CUSTOMER SERVICE REP STATED SINCE SHE DID NOT HERE THIS SHE COULD NOT LET THE ACTUAL TECH LOOK AT IT. I DEMANDED THE TECH TO LOOK AT IT. FINALLY THE TECH AND CUSTOMER SERVICE REP TOLD ME I HAD A RATTLE IN MY CLUTCH DUE TO MY BALD TIRES.???? SINCE I DID NEED NEW TIRES, I REPLACED ALL 4. MY CLUTCH STILL RATTLED. (SHOCKER) I THEN DECIDED TO TAKE MY VW TO ANOTHER VW SERVICE DEALER, AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THE RATTLE WAS A LOOSE HEAT PLATE. VW DEALER STATED THIS WAS FIXED. THE NEXT DAY THIS RATTLE WAS STILL THERE. I HAVE TAKEN THIS CAR IN FOR A TOTAL OF 3 TIMES FOR THIS RATTLE. I HAVE DECIDED ON GETTING A NEW NON-VW CAR. NOT ONLY HAS THE CAR DISSAPPOINTED ME BUT THE SERVCIE POEPLE HAVE TREATED ME AND MY HUSBAND LIKE IGNORANT CONSUMERS.

THEY TOLD THE DEALERSHIP NOT TO FIX IT AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FILE WITH OUR INSURANCE BECAUSE THERE WERE CRASH DATA CODES.  THEY DID NOT BOTHER READING THE CODES TO SEE HOW FAST I WAS DRIVING, BUT THEY DECIDED IT WAS MY FAULT SINCE THE ALIGNMENT WAS OFF, THEREFORE I MUST HAVE HIT A POTHOLE.  AFTER 3 WEEKS OF FIGHTING WITH VW AMERICA, WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, AFTER 2 WEEKS OF WAITING TO HEAR FROM THEM, THEY ALSO SAID THEY COULD NOT HELP, THEY STOPPED HELPING AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT ACCIDENT VICTIMS OVER A YEAR AGO.

AFTER SEVERAL CALLS TO DICK HANNAH VOLKSWAGEN (DHVW) DEALERSHIP AND VOLKSWAGEN USA, DHVW FIXED THE SEAT HEATER DEFECT AND PROVIDED A CONTACT TO VOLKSWAGEN USA.     DHVW PROVIDED MEDIOCORE CUSTOMER SERVICE, LACKED WILLINGNESS TO FULLY DISCUSS THE PROBLEM WITHOUT REPEATED PROMPTS, HAD NO IDEA WHETHER THIS DEFECT HAS BEEN FOUND IN OTHER VOLKSWAGEN VEHICLES AND WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION.      ULTIMATELY, I AM A VERY UNHAPPY DICK HANNAH VOLKSWAGEN CUSTOMER, WITH A CAR THAT MAKES AFRAID TO DRIVE WITH THE SEAT HEATER FEATURE, NO COMPENSATION FOR MY WINTER COAT AND PANTS, TIME FROM WORK AND STRESS.  *LA",

MILEAGE AT TIME OF NHTSA COMPLAINT - 1550.    PROBLEM:  DOOR \"RATTLE\" UNDER ANY DRIVING CONDITION.  THE \"RATTLING\" WAS FIRST THOUGHT TO BE THE PANELING.  TEFLON TAPE WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE METAL PART AND THE PLASTIC PANELING.  THIS PROCEDURE STOPPED THE PANELING FROM MAKING ANY NOISE.    BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  THE NOISE \"RATTLING\" IS COMING FROM THE UPPER FRAME OF THE DOOR.  MEANING THE DOOR IS NOT CLOSING OR MEETING THE ROOF/PILLAR SECTION OF THE ROOF.  WATER PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR.  THE OTHER DAY WE HAD RAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND WATER WAS COMING IN WHILE THE CAR WAS DRIVEN.    THE DEALERSHIP HAS TRIED SEVERAL APPROACHES INCLUDING THE ONE MENTIONED ABOVE.  ALSO, VW TECH SUPPORT HAS BEEN CONTATED AND SUGGESTED TO REPLACE THE DOOR STRIKERS.  DOOR STRIKERS (ALL 4) HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND NO IMPROVEMENT.  DEALERSHIP IS WAITING FOR \"VW ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT TO GET BACK FROM THE HOLIDAYS\" TO SEE WHAT STEPS TO BE TAKEN.     I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE DOOR ARE NOT CLOSING PROPERLY.  IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT WILL THE DOOR HOLD IN PLACE?  WHAT HAPPENS IF I INSTALL A ROOF RACK AND PLACE A LOAD IN THE ROOF?  IS THE ROOF GOING TO GIVE IN SINCE IT IS MISSING THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE DOORS?    MY MAIN CONCERN IS IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT ARE THE DOOR GOING TO HOLD IN PLACE OR ARE THEY GOING TO FLY OF SINCE THE VIBRATION \"OPENING AND CLOSING\" THE DOORS? TS",
