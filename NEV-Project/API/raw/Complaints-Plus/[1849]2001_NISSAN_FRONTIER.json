THERE WERE A FEW RECALLS,  BUT RECALL ID # 5971 WHICH IS A RECALL OF THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS THE ONE THAT SEEMED TO BE AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD(ENGINE CAN STOP RUNNING WITHOUT WARNING RESULTING IN A CRASH).  I CALLED THE NISSAN'S HEAD OFFICE TO SEE IF THE RECALL HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO OPEN RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT ALL RECALLS ON MY VIN # HAD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.  SO KNOWING THIS I BELIEVED THAT THE SENDING UNIT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM.    3. MY MECHANIC REMOVED AND REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND THE VEHICLE STILL WOULD NOT RUN.  I MENTIONED THE RECALL TO HIM AND HE THEN CAREFULLY CHECKED THE SENDING UNIT FOR CORROSION AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL SHORT ON THE ONE CONNECTORS ON TOP OF THE UNIT THAT HE FOUND DUE TO THE PLASTIC ON UNDER THE CONNECTOR BEING CRACKED.

THESE REPAIRS ARE PENDING AND HAVE BEEN SINCE JUNE 30, 2008. THE FUEL TANK  IS UNAVAILABLE AND HAS BEEN FOR 108 DAYS, AS OF TODAY OCT. 15. IT HAS BEEN INOPERABLE AND HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER SINCE JUNE 30.  ORIGINAL ISSUE BEGAN ON JUNE 13, 2008. THE VEHICLE STRUGGLED TO TURN OVER, EMITTED HEAVY DARK EXHAUST, THE SMELL OF GASOLINE WAS PRESENT, THE SERVICE-ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AND I EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF POWER WHILE GETTING IT TO THE FITZGERALD AUTO MALL DEALER IN CHAMBERSBURG PA. THE REQUIRED WORK WAS COMPLETED ON JUNE 18. THE REPAIR WORK INCLUDED REPLACING THE KNOCK SENSOR (CODE P0325) AND RELATED GASKETS, REPLACING THE VENT CONTROL VALVE AND CHARCOAL CANISTER (CODE P1441). THERE WAS NO MENTION OF ANY RECALL WORK REGARDING THE FUEL SYSTEM. I DROVE THE TRUCK FOR SIX DAYS.  ON JUNE 29  THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS APPEARED. I GOT THE TRUCK HOME (BARELY) AND CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER. ON JUNE 30, THE DIAGNOSIS CAME BACK. SAME PROBLEM, DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS.   THE CODES WERE PULLED AND  P1441 CAME UP AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME THE REQUIRED PART TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE IS A NEW FUEL STORAGE TANK-- A PART THAT WAS RECALLED.   MY REPAIRS IN JUNE WERE IN EXCESS OF $1200.  I ALSO NEEDED A LOANER VEHICLE AT $35 A DAY . I AM OUT $$1,636.42 AND HAVE MADE 7 BI-WEEKLY CAR PAYMENTS AT $144 FOR A TRUCK I CAN'T DRIVE. THE  REGIONAL SPECIALIST FOR NISSAN HAS PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIRS, BUT HAS NOT DELIVERED YET. NISSAN WON'T REIMBURSE UNTIL THE PART IS IN THE VEHICLE. MY CASE NUMBER WITH NISSAN IS 6262993.    THE PART IS \"DUE\" AT THE DEALER THE LAST WEEK OF OCTOBER, HOWEVER A RECALL REPAIR SHOULD NOT TAKE 4 MONTHS.

I GUESS GETTING NEW TIRES BEFORE THEY WEAR OUT IS OKAY BUT I DO WANT THEM TO LAST A LITTLE LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS AND THEN THERE IS THE RELIABILITY/ SAFETY FACTOR. I WAS LOOKING AT THE OTHER THREE TIRES ON MY TRUCK THAT HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED AND I NOTICED A BULGE IN THE SIDE WALL. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO STATE I AM NOT AN IDIOT I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORDS BEING WRAPPED TOO TIGHT AND A BULGE. SO FIRST I NOTICED THE LR THEN THE LF SO I CHECKED THE RR (THERE WAS NO PROBLEM) THAT WAS THE ONE REPLACED ABOUT 3 WEEK AGO THEN I WENT TO THE RF AND THE SAME THING WAS GOING ON. SO AS I CONTINUED TO INSPECT THE TIRES I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT WAS ODD. ALL OF THE BULGES WERE IN OR NEAR THE SAME PLACE ON THE TIRE. YOU SEE THEY HAVE A FLAG EMBLEM ON THEM AND I FOUND THAT OUT AS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MENTAL NOTE OF WHERE EVERY BULGE WAS. I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO STATE THIS IS A NEW TRUCK SO I KNOW EVERY INCH VERY WELL. SO THE LR RIGHT THROUGH THE FLAG. THE LF 1 INCH TO THE LEFT OF THE FLAG AND THE RF AROUND THE SAME. I THINK THIS IS WEIRD AND AM SURE THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE WHO WILL COME FORTH AND SAY THE SAME. SO TOMORROW I WILL GO DOWN AND HAVE THEM INSPECTED HOPEFULLY REPLACED AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. IT IS PROBABLY JUST ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS AND THEY WILL REPLACE AND SEEING HOW I HAVE THE TIRE INSURANCE I GUESS I CAN CONSIDER MY SELF LUCKY IT IS ONLY GOING TO COST ME $16.00 FOR LABOR AND DISPOSAL, BUT FOR THOSE WHO THOUGHT OH I DON'T NEED IT AS I DID MANY TIMES BEFORE I WORKED AT A TIRE STORE IT SUCKS !! THE TIRES WEREN'T CHEAP AT AROUND $600.00+. SO IF YOU ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM PLEASE LET ME AND OTHER PEOPLE KNOW BEFORE WE HAVE ANOTHER 235/75/15 FIRESTONE PROBLEM. JEFFHATHAWAY@SBCGLOBAL.NET  *JB",
