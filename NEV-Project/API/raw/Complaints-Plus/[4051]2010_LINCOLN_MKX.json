I have had the recall notice regarding the air bag for almost a year already.   Ford motor company deemed my vehicle safe to drive with this airbag issue.  As it turns out, the brake booster bladder has a tear in it.  I purchased the vehicle in 2020 and never was never sent a recall notice on the brake booster even though Ford Motor Company knew about it.  According to what I have read online, Ford Motor decided that the recall was only good for a specific amount of time.  How can that possibly be the case.

I HAVE HAD A KNEE REPLACEMENT WHICH LEFT ME WITH REDUCED RANGE OF MOTION IN MY LEG.  MY ISSUE IS THAT I CANNOT STRAIGHTEN MY LEG OUT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE WHILE DRIVING DUE TO THE LIMITED REARWARD MOTION OF THE SEAT.

MY PROPOSAL IS TO RAISE THE SEAT HEIGHT APPROXIMATELY 3\" AND ADD A PIECE OF FLAT METAL UNDER THE SEAT TRACK WHICH COULD BE REDRILLED TO ALLOW THE SEAT TO MOVE REARWARD APPROXIMATELY 3+\".  THESE MODIFICATIONS WOULD USE THE SAME HOLES IN THE SEAT TRACK AND THE ATTACHMENT LOCATIONS IN THE FLOOR THAT EXIST NOW.
