THE 3RD I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE. AS I GOT ON THE OFF RAMP THE CAR BEEPED LIKE IT WAS OUT OF GAS AND THEN ABOUT A SECOND LATER THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT AND OIL TEMPERATURE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR FELT LIKE SOME ONE HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES BRIEFLY. THIS CAUSED ME TO PULL SLIGHTLY TO THE SIDE WHEN THIS HAPPENED. LUCKILY THIS HAPPENED ON THE OFF RAMP AND NOT THE INTERSTATE TRAVELING IN TRAFFIC AT 70MPH WHERE I FEAR IT MAY HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT WITH ANOTHER DRIVER OR BY MYSELF AS IT CAUSE ME TO PULL TO THE SIDE, NO WAY OF TELLING WHAT WOULD OF HAPPENED. BUT I'M FEARFUL. CHRYSLER HAS TRIED TO FIX THIS 2 TIMES. THIS WILL BE THEIR 3RD ATTEMPT.  *TR",
