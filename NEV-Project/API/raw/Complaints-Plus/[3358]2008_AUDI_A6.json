THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS CAUSED BY DIRECT FUEL INJECTION OF THEIR ENGINE AND IS COMMON WITH EVERY FSI ENGINE AS I WAS TOLD.  NO FIX FOR THIS AND THEY WILL BE CHARGING ABOUT 1500 TO CLEAN AND FIX THE PROBLEM TEMPORARY WHEN THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.     SECOND ISSUE IS WITH MULTITRONIC CVT.  THIS IS ALSO THEIR DESIGN FLAW WHERE THE TRANSMISSION HAVE DIFFICULTIES ENGAGING CAUSING SEVERE SHUDDER AND JERKING DURING AN ACCELERATION FROM STOP.  I HAVE DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE THROTTLE AND IF I STEP ON THE GAS PEDAL HARDER, IT WILL CAUSE SUDDEN ACCELERATION AND IF I DON'T, THE CAR WILL JERK BACK AND FORTH AND WILL NOT GET DECENT ACCELERATION, WHICH IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.     AUDI STATES THAT THERE ARE NO COMPLAINTS FOR THIS AND THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING FINE.  I HAD THE LOANER (A4 CVT) ONE AND THE CAR  ALSO HAD THE SAME ISSUE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SEVERE.    TOYOTA IS BEING HONEST ABOUT THEIR FAULTS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE AUDI IS TRYING TO HIDE THIS ISSUE UNTIL THERE IS A DEATH OR AN INJURY INVOLVE, WHICH BY THAT TIME, TOO LATE. *TR",
