AS THE DOG CROSSED THE CENTER CONSOLE HE STEPPED ON THE ON/OFF BUTTON SHUTTING OFF THE CAR WHICH CAUSED A LOSS OF STEERING AND BRAKES.  MY WIFE WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS SHE WAS ON A LOCAL ROAD AND NOT GOING FAST BUT IF SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO TURN OR IF SHE HAD BEEN ON A ROAD WITH A HIGHER SPEED LIMIT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A CRASH.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AND THE ON/OFF SWITCH SHOULD NOT BE OPERABLE WHILE IN DRIVE - ONLY IN NEUTRAL OR PARK.  THIS MAY IMPACT OTHER AUDI CARS AS WELL.  *TR",
