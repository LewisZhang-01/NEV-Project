I HAVE HAD THIS BIKE SERVICED AT EVERY SERVICE INTERVAL AND GREASING THE SPLINES IS NOT IN THE SERVICE. NOR CAN THEY BE GREASED WHEN THE TIRE CHANGE IS PERFORMED WITHOUT HAVING TO REMOVE THE 4 BOLTS THAT HOLD THE DRIVE SHAFT IN THE COVER OF THE DIFFERENTIAL. MY SPLINES STRIPPED OUT WHILE TRAVELING AT 70 MPH ON A HIGHWAY CAUSING  ME TO BE STRANDED AND ALMOST BEING RAN OVER BY THE CARS THAT WERE BEHIND ME TRAVELING THE SAME DIRECTION DUE TO THE BIKE LOOSING SPEED AND SLOWING DOWN VERY QUICKLY. WHEN I TOOK THE BIKE IN TI BE INSPECTED THE SPLINES WERE BONE-DRY AND THE PART THAT HAD STRIPPED WAS ON THE PARTS DIAGRAM BUT DIDN'T HAVE A PART NUMBER SO I COULD NOT ORDER THE PART I HAD TO BUY THE ENTIRE REAR DIFFERENTIAL ASSEMBLY AT AROUND $1,200.00 TO $1,300.00 DOLLARS.. I'M SURE YAMAHA IS AWARE OF THIS DUE TO THE FACT THEY QUIT MAKING THIS MODEL FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND NOW THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAS BEEN ENGINEERED DIFFERENTLY, THE SPLINES ARE NOW KEPT OILED BY GEAR OIL IN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL..   IF I DIDN'T MANEUVER QUICKLY I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT..",
