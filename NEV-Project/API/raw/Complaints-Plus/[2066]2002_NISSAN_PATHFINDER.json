LEVEL 2 REQUIRES A BOLTED IN METAL BRACE BE INSTALLED TO REINFORCE THE STRUT TOWER. NISSAN CORPORATE TOLD ME THE LEVEL 1 REPAIR WAS ALREADY COMPLETED AND NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE EVEN THOUGH THE REPAIR DID NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM AND NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LEVEL 2 REPAIR.    I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NISSAN CAN WALK AWAY FROM THIS AFTER THEIR LEVEL 1 FIX FAILS TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. THE LEVEL 1 REPAIR IS A TICKING TIME BOMB AS THE SO CALLED \"FIX\" DOES NOTHING TO STOP THE TOWER FROM FAILING.

AFTER HAVING IT TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND SERVICE, THE TECHNICIAN NOTICED THAT AN INTERNAL POWER CONTROL VALVE WAS MISSING FROM THE INTAKE AFTER HE HAD REMOVED THE VALVE COVER DURING HIS TROUBLESHOOTING. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW (SOLE OWNER) AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY WORK/MAINTENANCE PERFORMED THAT REQUIRED THE VALVE COVER TO BE REMOVED.

I ALSO NOTED THAT NISSAN (WEST COAST, CALIFORNIA) RECENTLY RECALLED VARIOUS MODELS/MULTI-YEARS, INCLUDING THE 2002 PATHFINDER, ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM WITH LOOSENING FASTENERS WITHIN THE RESPECTIVE ENGINES; HOWEVER, NO RECALL WAS ENACTED FOR THE SAME MODELS ON THE EAST COAST USA.

WE HAD TO TOW OUR CAR HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT HAD NO BRAKES AND WAS UNSAFE. THE CAR IS NOW SITTING IN OUR DRIVEWAY UNUSABLE. WE DROVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND CANNOT DRIVE IT NOW (AFTER CAMPAIGN REPAIR).  OUR MECHANIC INSPECTED THE REPAIR AND FOUND THE ABS BOX NOT SECURED (BOLT MISSING).

IN ADDITION, THE RIGHT FRONT STRUT IS LEAKING WHICH IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CAMPAIGN ISSUE. THE LEFT FRONT SWAY BAR LINK IS BROKEN DUE TO THE STRESS OF THE RIGHT FRONT STRUT HOUSING ISSUE.

WE HAVE TRIED TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES WITH THE DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS REGIONAL SPECIALIST BUT WE WERE TOLD THAT ALL ASSOCIATED ISSUES ARE AT THE DEALERSHIP'S DISCRETION.

NOT TO GET FIXED, JUST TO HOOK UP.  I THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. SO I TOOK IT TO 2 DIFFERENT PLACES, A LOCAL MECHANIC AND AUTOZONE, BOTH EQUIPPED WITH COMPUTER HOOK UPS, CAPABLE OF \"READING\" NISSAN CODES.  AT FIRST, THE CODE INDICATED A PROBLEM WITH THE \"R\" VALVE TIMING SOLENOID, WHICH I PROCEEDED TO CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE LIGHT CONTINUED ON.  I TOOK IT BACK, AND NOW IT WAS THE \"L\" SIDE, WHICH I ALSO CHANGED. THESE TWO CHANGES COST ME $500.    BUT THE LIGHT CONTINUES ON.  NOW IS GIVING CODES FOR THE CAM/CRANK SENSOR, DIRT BUILD UP, THE IVT CONTROL SOLENOID OPEN OR SHORTED. AT THIS POINT IS WHEN I CONTACTED NISSAN.  I WAS ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER (11149465) AND EVENTUALLY TALKED TO A [XXX], 800/343-6913, EXT 458103. SHE INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD IF I DID NOT TAKE THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER. THEY STILL WOULD CHARGE OVER $100 JUST TO CONNECT TO THE COMPUTER. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE MONIES ALREADY SPENT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT OTHER OWNERS OF NISSAN VEHICLES HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST (PATHFINDER, 2002) AND PROBLEM.  THAT I HAD BEEN TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE CHECK UP SINCE I BOUGHT IT NEW, WHICH COULD BE EASILY VERIFIED.  THAT THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 60,000 MILES.HOWEVER, THAT WAS NISSAN FINAL POSITION. I CAN PROVIDE THE BILL PAID AND DIAGNOSIS. THIS PROBLEM IS, AND HAS BEEN, A HEADACHE FOR US OWNERS, NOT TO MENTION THE EXPENSE AND TIME COMMITMENT.

ALSO, THIS IS THE SECOND 2002 PATHFINDER WE HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN TO. THE OTHER ONE WAS MY DAUGHTER'S. I AM AN OPERATIONS RESEARCH SYSTEMS ENGINEER AND KNOW THAT THE PROBABILITY OF THIS OCCURRING TO TWO VEHICLES OF THE SAME YEAR WITHIN THE SAME FAMILY; BOTH PURCHASED FROM THE SAME LOCATION IS A PRIME INDICATOR OF A SYSTEMIC ENGINEERING PROBLEM.    THE FACTORS ARE THAT THE BOLTS WORK LOOSE AND DROP INTO THE CYLINDERS. IF THEY DO NOT GET CAUGHT IN THE CYLINDER, THEY ARE BLOWN OUT THE EXHAUST. IF THEY DO GET CAUGHT BY THE PISTON, THEY SCRATCH THE WALLS OF THE CYLINDERS ALLOWING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OIL TO BE FORCED INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE IT IGNITES AND IS EXHAUSTED. THE SUBSEQUENT REPAIR IS COSTING $5200.    IN BOTH OF THESE SITUATIONS, THE OIL RESERVOIR WAS EMPTIED WITHIN 2-3 DAYS. I KNOW THIS AS I CONSTANTLY CHECK VEHICLE FLUIDS (I WAS AN ARMY OFFICER AND HAD A MOTOR POOL). I CAUGHT A LOW OIL QUANTITY IN BOTH VEHICLES; REFILLED THE RESERVOIR; AND CHECKED IN A FEW DAYS TO FIND THEM NEAR EMPTY AGAIN. I ALSO KNOW THAT HAD THE OIL RUN OUT WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, AN ENGINE SEIZING COULD POTENTIALLY OCCUR, CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE AND POTENTIAL SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. WHEN THIS OCCURRED, ON BOTH VEHICLES, I TOOK THE VEHICLES TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION/REPAIR. THEY SEEMED TO BE UNAWARE OF THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM AND RECOMMENDED A SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC ACTION AT A COST OF $2000 THAT ONLY WOULD DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND NOT REPAIR IT.

RECENTLY WHEN IT WENT TO A SHOP FOR SOME UNDERCAR WORK, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WERE BOTH SPLIT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND REQUESTED REPLACEMENT UNDER THE 8 YEAR 80,000 MILE WARRANTY MANDATED ON EMISSIONS EQUIPMENT.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THOSE PARTS WERE INDEED LEAKING BADLY, AND THAT NISSAN HAD  SO MANY FAILURES THAT THEY HAD DEVELOPED A SPECIAL PATCH KIT FOR THEM.  I DECLINED THE PATCH DUE TO AN EXCESSIVE COST FOR A FEW LARGE CLAMPS AND SOME EXHAUST CEMENT.    SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT NUMEROUS OTHER PATHFINDERS OF SIMILAR VINTAGE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, THUS THERE IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE IN THE WELDING OF THE SEAMS OF THIS PART WHICH ACCORDING TO MIDAS IS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND ACCORDING TO NISSAN IS A RESONATOR.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS CARBON MONOXIDE IS BEING RELEASED DIRECTLY UNDER THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.    A COMPLAINT WAS FILED WITH NISSAN AND THEY CLAIM IT IS PART OF STANDARD WARRANTY AND THUS NOT COVERED, AND THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  I INFORMED THEM OF MY INTENT TO PROCEED WITH COMPLAINTS TO NHTSA AND A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IF NECESSARY TO FORCE A RECALL OF THIS DEFECT THAT IS CAUSING SAFETY ISSUES FOR ALL OWNERS OF NISSAN PATHFINDERS OF SIMILAR VINTAGE. *TR",
