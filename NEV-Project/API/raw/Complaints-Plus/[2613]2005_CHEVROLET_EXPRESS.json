My white van has missing paint from about 75% of the vehicle, with bubbling going on, in the remainder of paint that has yet to fall off!  Looking at ANY Chevy van that is on the roadways, one can easily see that the paint has also been falling off those vehicles, as well!  This is a well-known defect in the painting practices of most ALL Chevrolet Vans, and should be dealt with on a class-action basis, since all Chevrolet Van owners are forced to live with an inferior paint scheme on these vehicles! But new owners are not aware of these shortcomings, until they see the paint fall off their vans, for no apparent reason!  And it is clearly seen that NO PAINT PRIMER was used, when you look at the paint chip that fell off!  Shame on Chevrolet and shame on the NHTSA agency for allowing any auto manufacturer to put out such inferior products to unsuspecting consumers!",
