My husband started the car and we immediately heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d and saw a crack spread in several directions from the driver\u2019s side edge of the windshield across the driver\u2019s line of vision. Upon closer inspection, we were able to see 3 tiny chips in the glass, one of which was incorporated into the crack. As the driver of this vehicle at least 5/7 days a week, these chips in the driver\u2019s side windshield were small enough that I had not noticed  them before (see pictures).  This crack impairs my ability to operate this vehicle safely because it obstructs my line of vision. Had we been driving when it happened, the cracking may have caused an accident. I am also concerned that the windshield is not appropriately tempered to provide adequate protection and structural integrity in the event of a collision.  This is the third spontaneously cracked windshield I have experienced with this vehicle since I purchased it brand new in Nov 2017. The first cracked windshield occurred within months of my purchasing the vehicle. The dealership where I purchased it replaced the windshield with no cost to me at that time. I was given the impression that the original windshield was faulty and the replacement would not be, though no fault was admitted by Subaru. The second incident occurred about one year ago, a little over 3 years after we purchased the Outback. This being the third windshield to spontaneously crack, I would like to try replacing it with an after market windshield. However, I have been informed by both the Subaru dealership and the local windshield replacement business that has worked closely with my dealership the two previous times I needed replacement, that an after market windshield can not be calibrated for my vehicle\u2019s EyeSight system. If I use an after market windshield, I will have to forgo the added safety features provided by the EyeSight system.",

With brakes applied, and while putting vehicle into park, the vehicle suddenly accelerated forward making contact with a suspended shelf attached to the back wall of the garage.  The force of the vehicle was such that the shelf and back wall of the garage were completely separated from the home in one piece and pushed approximately 10 yards away from the home before the shelf broke away from the wall upon impact with the ground, perpendicular to the back of the house. The vehicle then traveled down two hills in the back yard, across a water saturated easement, over a concrete drainage culvert and came to rest at the base of an incline in an adjacent yard approximately 150 ft from the garage.   Air bags did not deploy and the owner suffered minor contusions causing pain and stiffness, but no significant injuries are noted as of this report. The vehicle was totaled and significant damage was caused to the residence. No collision warnings were displayed prior to collision and emergency braking did not apply upon acceleration.   This was the first incidence of sudden acceleration experienced by the owner so this issue has never been checked out by a service technician and will not be repaired. The vehicle had less than 8000 miles on the odometer. The vehicle is currently located in a repair lot and the owner\u2019s insurance company has been requested to hold the vehicle for inspection prior to disposal.  The cause of the sudden acceleration is unknown, but the owner is confident that the brakes were being applied at the time of occurrence, and that they remained cognizant throughout the incident as they were unable to stop the forward progression of the vehicle until it came to rest on the muddy incline.",

With routine wiping of the snow off of my windshield, the snow brush made minor contact with the windshield, and the bottom of the windshield cracked. The resulting crack is approximately 2-3 feet long at the bottom of the windshield. The crack partially impedes vision and may impair the functioning of the Eyesight safety system in the car. After online research, it appears that this is a problem present in the windshields of most Subaru 2017-2020 models. The contact was very minor as would be expected in any daily snow removal, and if this level of contact causes this level of damage to these windshields, that could cause many safety and visibility issues if a stray pebble were to strike the windshield of a moving vehicle.",

I'm still trying to understand all of these but some seem to have a mind of their own.    I discovered the car's battery dead on the morning of 11/14/21.  There was no warning that there might be a low battery problem and the car worked fine the previous day.  I researched on-line about why this would suddenly happen and came across the Class-Action Lawsuit filed in April 2020 regarding these problems with Subaru Outback and Ascend models.  I will also be contacting the legal team involved with the lawsuit, McKenzie Lake Lawyers, to verify if I need to take any steps prior to having my car fixed.  Because Subaru of America and its dealerships deny there is a fundamental problem with premature battery draining, there is no verifiable source on how to repair the car, outside of simply replacing the battery, or how to reset the associated memory features.  I have no idea of what electronic and safety features will or will not be operating properly once I replace the battery.  I'm also very hesitant to take the car on a long trip over the Thanksgiving Day week.",

Stopped by Wheeling Volkswagen/Subaru Dealership just before their daily closing. They inspected and found the above ruptured fuel line, leaking onto the pavement under the engine compartment. They determined it was unsafe to drive, but did not have a replacement part. They found there were less than 10 of these fuel injector fuel delivery lines available in the whole U.S. Had to leave the vehicle with them, and the repair was completed 4 day later. The faulty component was observed by the service department personel, and by myself. I have no photos to submit, but have the repair invoice covered under Subaru's drive train warranty. This component failure could have easily resulted in a vehicle fire or explosion, and I feel very fortunate that did not happen!

At the first intersection stop sign when the accelerator was pushed at first nothing happened\u2026that is the car did not accelerate, then abruptly the car lurched forward.  Alarmed we drove it around a large parking parking lot, stopping, then trying to start again..we found the hesitating, then lurching forward to continue, so we changed drivers with the same result.  As it was now late on a Saturday afternoon in this small town with no local garages open, we had the car \u201cRoll-Backed\u201d to the nearest Subaru Dealer in Fayetteville, NC and as there were no local car rentals available, we had a family member drive 108 miles (each way) to get us and take us to the beach.  The Fayetteville Subaru Dealer called on Monday morning and said \u201cthey could find nothing wrong\u201d, and to pick up the car (another 100+ miles each way). Needless to say, I was very nervous the whole way home from the beach ..but the trip was without incident.",

The Subaru dealership quickly realized this was not caused by road debris and kindly replaced the windshield. In April of the same year, just a month later, another crack appeared on the windshield again emanating from the frame this time only from the left side straight across the driver's view. Subaru graciously replaced the window again calling it a courtesy at no cost to us though they proclaimed it to be from road debris. My third incident happened in December of 2019 emanating from the middle of the  frame then gradually extending out towards the driver's side of the windshield. Subaru again claimed this was road debris but agreed to pay my deductible.  So now I have approached my 4th incident on May 16, 2021. Again the crack started from the car frame in the middle of the windshield, same as in December, and has extended once more across the windshield in front of the driver's side creating a visibility issue for the driver. This time Subaru will not even acknowledge causality and is denying any issue regarding the design of the car. They are advising I contact my insurance company to have it repaired. Yes Subaru has been generous in the past but does not recognize that there must be an issue with this 2018 Subaru Outback model that causes such damage to the windshield - cracks that emanate  from the frame and gradually extend along the horizontal plane of the windshield causing visibility issues for the driver. For Subaru to contend that all these incidents are caused by road debris would have me believe they think I live in or close to a rock quarry which I guarantee is not even remotely true. My daily commute is only 2 miles through a suburban neighborhood with an occasional road trip. This may be a great car but to have to deal with this every year is a long stretch for my patience and safety.",

Then in Nov 2020, it cracked again and a different Subaru dealership did cover the cost of the third windshield replacement, but only after filing a compliant with Subaru Corporate. Now in May 2021, the windshield has cracked again with little to no impact and needs to be replaced. Each time the windshield cracked, it significantly spread across the the windshield within hours, and poses a risk to driving.

TRANSMISSION TUNNEL INTRUDES IN DRIVING POSITION TO OPERATE GAS PEDDLE  2. GAS PEDAL IS TUCKED AWAY TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT (LINE OF SIGHT COVERED BY TRANSMISSION TUNNEL)  3. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE GAS AND BRAKE PEDAL ARE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER CAR THAT WE HAVE OWNED. OPERATING THE TWO PEDALS REQUIRE WIDE TURN OF RIGHT ANKLE).

VERY DISAPPOINTED A SMALL PELLET HITTING THE WINDSHIELD RESULTED IN A CRACK THAT WAS SO BIG THAT I HAD TO ENTIRELY REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. MY CAR IS ONLY 1 YEAR OLD, AND A SMALL STONE COST ME OVER $500, PLUS THE COST OF A PROTECTANT PROGRAM THAT FAILED AS WELL.   DEALER (WILLIAMS SUBARU) SAID IT WAS AN AUTO INSURANCE ISSUE, NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, OR UNDER THE ZURICHSHIELD (FIXES UP TO 6 INCH CRACK- MINE NEVER QUIT GROWING), THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'M CHECKING INTO GETTING A REFUND ON THE ZURICHSHIELD POLICY...",

I PRESSED THE X-MODE BUTTON HOPING IT WOULD INCREASE MY TRACTION ON THE WINDING ROADS.  AS THE CAR WAS COMING DOWN FAIRLY STEEP DECLINE, I NOTICED THAT I WAS GAINING SPEED AND X-MODE HAD TURNED ITSELF OFF.  I CAME AROUND A CURVE A LITTLE FAST AND FELT THAT IT TOOK MORE EFFORT THAN I'D EXPECTED TO SLOW THE CAR.  AT THAT POINT, THE ROAD LEVELED OUT AND THE RAIN HAD STOPPED, BUT MY SPEED WAS STILL ACCELERATING.  I HAD TO KEEP MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO MAINTAIN A SAFE SPEED.  I DECIDED TO PULL OVER, PUT THE CAR IN PARK, AND TURN OFF THE IGNITION IN HOPES THAT WOULD RESET THE ENGINE.  AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, I STARTED UP THE CAR AGAIN, PUT IT INTO DRIVE, AND WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL IT BEGAN TO ACCELERATE.  AFTER IT REACHED APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH (WHICH WAS THE SPEED LIMIT) ON ITS OWN I PULLED OVER AGAIN TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  MY FIANCE SUGGESTED PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, THINKING THAT COULD RESET WHATEVER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS IN DRIVE.  I SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND AGAIN, THE CAR ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN.  IT WENT FROM 0 MPH TO 40 MPH IN NEUTRAL.  IT GAINED SPEED IN A STEADY AND CONSISTENT PACE, ABOUT 1 MPH EVERY 1.5 SECONDS.  MY FIANCE CALLED SUBARU OF AMERICA, HOPING THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THEY RECOMMENDED WE GET IT CHECKED OUT AT A DEALERSHIP AND THAT THE CLOSEST SUBARU DEALERSHIP WAS MORE THAN 200 MILES AWAY.  WHILE HE WAS ON THE PHONE, THE CAR BEGAN DECELERATING WITHOUT HAVING TOUCHED THE GAS OR BRAKE PEDALS.   AFTER THAT, IT BEGAN DRIVING NORMALLY AND I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY FURTHER ISSUES UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO GET HOME AND BRING THE CAR IN FOR INSPECTION.",
