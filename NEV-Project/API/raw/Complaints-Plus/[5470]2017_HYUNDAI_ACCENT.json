CONFUSED AS TO WHY THERE WAS NO OIL WE KEPT INVESTIGATING BECAUSE AS STATED BEFORE THE CAR HAD AN OIL CHANGE THE MONTH PRIOR.  WE REPLACED THE OIL YET AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE TICKING KEPT GETTING LOUDER EVEN WITH OIL BEING CHECKED DAILY. THIS CAR ONLY HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT. I FINALLY TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC WHO TOLD BE IT WAS MY ROD BERINGS I WAS GIVEN A QUOTE TO FIX IT IN WHICH WE AGREED I COULD FIX IT BUT IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME FOR ME TO GET THE MONEY. ON SATURDAY DECEMBER 6TH I WENT TO PICK MY CAR UP FROM THE MECHANIC UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO GET THE MONEY TO FIX IT. WHILE DRIVING IT HOME I KEPT SMELLING A BURNING SCENT BUT WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS IT ON THE ROAD. I TURNED OFF ALL EXTRAS IN THE CAR (HEATER , RADIO EVERYTHING THAT WASN'T CRITICAL TO DRIVING AT THE MOMENT ). I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME TAKING IT AS A EASY SPEED AND NOT TRYING TO OVERDO IT.

AFTER THE 3RD TIME I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM, I TOOK IT AGAIN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE CAR IS UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY. THE PROBLEM IS THE BRAKE PEDAL GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR BOARD AS MY BRAKES LOCK UP CAUSING THE FRONT TIRES TO LOCK UP THUS CAUSING MY CAR TO CONTINUE FORWARD WITHOUT ANY ABS SYSTEM BEING USED BY THE CAR BRAKING SYSTEM TO KEEP THE FRONT TIRES FROM LOCKING UP. ON THE THIRD TIME I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES.) NOT AT HIGH SPEEDS. IN FACT HE SAID HE COULD MAKE THE WHEELS LOCK UP GOING LESS THAN 3 MPH.) HOWEVER HE STATED BECAUSE THE COMPUTER ANALYSIS REPORTED NO ISSUES, HE COULD NOT REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART. AND I QUOTE HE SAID \" BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE A NATIONAL RECALL OF ALL THE HYUNDAI ELANTRA, ACCENT, SONATA AND GENESIS YRS 2017 THRU 2019. \". I HOPE TO DEAR GOD SOMEONE TAKES SOME ACTION ON THIS ISSUE. I AM GOING TO CONTACT A LARGE LAW FIRM TO START A CLASS ACTION SUIT TO PROTECT ALL DRIVERS OF THESE CARS AND THE INNOCENT DRIVERS ON THE ROAD THAT COULD BE INJURED OR KILLED BY THIS NEGLIGENT  RESPONSE TO A LIFE AND DEATH BRAKING SYSTEM DEFECT.  I EVEN LOOKED UP ON A GOOGLE SEARCH AND FOUND THIS BRAKING PROBLEM ON ALL OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED CARS. PLEASE TAKE SOME ACTION ON THIS PROBLEM.!!!!!!!!",
