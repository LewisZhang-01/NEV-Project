THIS RESULTED IN A NEW RADIATOR, LINES AND NOW TRANSMISSION FAILURE - ABOUT $4500 OF REPAIRS FROM A STEEL WASHER RUSTING!  I'VE READ A LOT OF BLOGS AND THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT HONDA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL FOR.  HONDA SIMPLY STATES THIS ISSUE TO BE CAUSED BY \"ENVIRONMENT\" AND DENIES RESPONSIBILITY.  ALL HONDA WOULD NEED TO DO IS HAVE PUT IN A WASHER THAT WOULDN'T HAVE RUSTED!  SERIOUSLY A SMALL STEEL WASHER WORTH .15 CENTS IS GOING TO COST ME ABOUT $4500.00 IN REPAIRS!  WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I'VE READ ABOUT ON BLOGS I'M SURPRISED MORE HAVEN'T LOGGED THIS WITH THE NHTSA.  HONDA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND I'M CONSIDERING SMALL CLAIMS COURT AGAINST HONDA OF AMERICA.  THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE WITH OTHER HONDA'S, NOT JUST THE RIDGELINE.    AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE I WAS AT A STOP LIGHT TURNING LEFT ON A CITY STREET.  AFTER PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE GAS TO START MY TURN,  I HEARD THE TRANSMISSION MAKE A FUNNY WHINE NOISE.  I DROVE ABOUT A MILE AND PULLED OVER TO SEE FLUID POURING OUT OF THE RADIATOR FILLER RESERVOIR.  MY INITIAL REPAIR COST ME ABOUT $1000 - NEW RADIATOR, ALL NEW LINES AND SEVERAL FLUSHES OF TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR.  MY MECHANIC SAID HE HOPED THE TRANSMISSION DIDN'T GET ANY RADIATOR FLUID IN IT.  I DROVE IT ABOUT A WEEK AND THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO FAIL.  I TOOK THE RIDGELINE TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND THE OWNER THERE WAS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THIS HONDA ISSUE.  HE SAID MY TRANSMISSION IS BEGINNING TOAST AND A REBUILD IS AROUND $3500.00 - SO I HAVE THAT SCHEDULED TO BE DONE SOON.",

IN DECEMBER AT 93,460 MILES MY TRUCK LOST ITS PERFECT HARMONY ... IT BEGAN PUTTING OUT WHITE/BLUE SMOKE. I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE THE ACCELERATOR TOOK OFF AND I HAD TO SHIFT DOWN AND BRAKE REAL HARD TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SPEED.

I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOMENT THAT THE CYLINDER \"BLEW OUT\".  I TOOK IT IN AND WAS TOLD THAT MY #4 SPARK PLUG WAS \"GUMMED\" UP AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED MILEAGE I SHOULD DO A FULL VALVE REPLACEMENT. $785 LATER, THE SMOKE EXHAUST WAS THE SAME AND 3 WEEKS LATER THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I TOOK IT BACK AND THEY \"SCOPED\" THE CYLINDERS AND FOUND #4 HAD \"POUCK\" MARKS AND HAD LOST COMPRESSION. I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE. I CALLED 5 AUTO SHOPS IN MY GENERAL AREA AND FOUND THAT 2 OF THEM HAD SEEN THE SAME ISSUE WITH A 2006 RIDGELNE AND A 2007 PILOT. BOTH MECHANICS TOLD ME THAT THE OWNERS HAD TAKEN THEM TO HONDA DEALERSHIPS & HONDA HAD REPLACED THEIR ENGINES, THEY \"WERE UNDER 100,000 MILES\". I DID SO, $97 LATER I WAS TOLD THAT \"NO. HONDA HAD DEEMED MY SITUATION NOT WORTHY OF A WARRANTY.\" WHAT?! I CAN'T EVEN TRADE IT IN TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE WITHOUT THE $5K REDUCTION IN VALUE! I HAVE A HISTORY OF TIMELY AND METICULOUS CARE WITH MY LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP AND A MECHANIC SHOP, THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM HONDA! YOU MUST HAVE AN ISSUE IF IN MY LITTLE SUBURB 2 OTHERS HAVE HAD #4 CYLINDERS GO BAD JUST BEFORE 100,000 MILES.  *TR",

WHILE SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT, THE CENTER REAR GLASS PANEL EXPLODED SENDING PIECES OF GLASS INTO THE CAB AND INTO THE BED OF THE TRUCK. NOBODY TOUCHED THE TRUCK AND NOTHING HIT IT. MY WIFE PARKS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER OFFICE WINDOW AND HAS PLAIN VIEW OF THE TRUCK. SHE WAS OUTSIDE AN HOUR EARLIER AND IT WAS FINE. WHEN SHE WENT OUTSIDE AGAIN, THE WHOLE PANEL WAS SHATTERED AND THE TOP RIGHT CORNER HAD FALLEN OFF. FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SOMETHING HAD HIT IT. I SEARCHED THE BED AND CAB FOR ANYTHING AS SMALL AS A BB. FOUND NOTHING. I STUDIED THE GLASS AND LOOKED AT HOW IT HAD FRACTURED. LOOKING AT THE GLASS (FROM IN THE CAB) THE FRACTURES ALL TRACED TO A POINT JUST BELOW THE PLASTIC TRIM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WINDOW. I TOOK OUT THE BACK SEATS AND BACK PANELS. THERE'S A SLIDE MECHANISM THAT OPENS AND CLOSES THE WINDOW USING A RAIL, A SLIDER SET IN THE RAIL, AND A CABLE.  I LOOKED TO SEE WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THE GLASS HITS WHEN IT'S CLOSED. I NOTICED A PRESSURE SWITCH NEAR THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE WINDOW. THIS SWITCH HAS A LITTLE SQUARE PIN THAT STICKS OUT. WHEN THE WINDOW CLOSES, IT PUSHES THE PIN IN. THIS TURNS OFF THE INDICATOR THAT LETS YOU KNOW THAT BACK WINDOW IS OPEN. THE PIN IS THE FIRST THING THE WINDOW HITS. IT'S SMALL, HARD AND PLASTIC. I PUSHED AGAINST IT AND IT TAKES A SOME FORCE TO PUSH IT IN. AFTER THE WINDOW STARTS PUSHING IN THE PIN,IT COMES TO REST ON A STOPPER IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER AND A VERTICAL ONE THAT RUNS THE HEIGHT OF THE WINDOW ALONG THE RIGHT EDGE. THE PIN IS SPRING LOADED AND IS CONSTANTLY PUSHING AGAINST THE WINDOW. SINCE ALL THE FRACTURE LINES POINTED TO THIS PIN, THIS IS PROBABLY WHERE THE FRACTURE ORIGINATED FROM. ONCE THE WINDOW REACHED A FAILURE POINT, POSSIBLY DUE TO REPEATEDLY HITTING THE PIN, THE PRESSURE OF THE SPRING LOADED PIN AGAINST THE WINDOW SUPPLIED THE FORCE THAT CAUSED IT TO SHATTER. *TR",

BEFORE 13TH STREET, IN THE INNER LANE (4 LANE ROAD), TRAVELING APPX. 25-30 MPH, WAS CROWDED INTO THE CURB BY A CAR IN LEFT HAND LANE.  THERE WAS NOT A HARD IMPACT, AS THE TRUCK WAS ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE CURB.  I FELT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRUCK START TO \"CLIMB UP\" ON THE CURB.  IMMEDIATELY FLATTENED BOTH TIRES ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  MAINTAINED CONTROL, & PULLED OFF IN PARKING LOT.  BOTH TIRES HAD \"U-SHAPED FLAPS\" RIPPED IN THE SIDEWALL.  OMITTED EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE \"RIPS\" TO REDUCE CHARACTER COUNT, BUT IT'S AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.  IT WAS NIGHT, BUT I LOOKED AT THE CURB & ROAD FOR ANY SHARP OBJECTS THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE DAMAGE TO THE SIDEWALLS & FOUND NOTHING. NEXT DAY, I EXAMINED THE CURB & VICINITY CLOSELY. I TOOK PHOTOS OF THE TIRES, THE CURB, & VICINITY.  THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY CAUSED THE DAMAGE. I BELIEVE THE TIRES BLEW OUT DUE TO LOW SPEED CONTACT WITH THE CURB.  I BELIEVE THE TIRE SIDEWALLS ARE INSUFFICIENT IN DESIGN & CONSTRUCT FOR USE ON THIS TRUCK, & THAT THE TIRE SIDEWALLS COLLAPSED SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CURB, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT SUSTAIN A DIRECT IMPACT. (ALL 4 TIRES FULLY INFLATED: TRUCK WAS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD & THE TIRES HAD < 5000 MILES ON THEM). I BELIEVE THE COLLAPSE OF THE SIDEWALL CAUSED IT TO BE \"PINCHED\" BY THE RIM, & DUE TO SUBSTANDARD SIDEWALL CONSTRUCT, IT WAS FOLLOWED BUT A SUDDEN & CATASTROPHIC RIP (BLOW OUT) UP THE SIDEWALL.  I STILL HAVE THE TWO TIRES.  THESE TIRES WERE MANUFACTURED FOR OEM PLACEMENT ON  A 4 WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK, BUT FAILED TO WITHSTAND A MINOR BRUSH WITH A CURB ON A CITY STREET. I BELIEVE THESE TIRES ARE INFERIOR IN DESIGN, DEFECTIVE IN CONSTRUCT, & SUB-STANDARD FOR THE APPLICATION.  *TR",

I PRESSED THE BRAKES DUE TO A STOP SIGN AND THE ENTIRE REAR AXLE COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM THE TRAILER. THE TRAILER COULD NOT BE PULLED UNLESS IT HAD BOTH OF ITS TWO AXLES ATTACHED. I CALLED THE TRAILER DEALER. THE LOCAL SHERIFF ARRIVED , ALTHOUGH I DID NOT CALL HIM  AND ACCOMPANIED ME AT 5 MPH TO A NEARBY COMMERCIAL TRAILER STOP. I CALLED A TRAILER REPAIR STATION LOCATED A BLOCK  AWAY, WHO CAME TO THE SITE TO RETRIEVE THE DETACHED AXLE. THE TRAILER MANUFACTURER SAID THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE,  EVEN THOUGH THE  DEALER MADE AN INQUIRY BEFORE THE WARRANTY ENDED. THEY  REQUESTED THAT THE AXLE BE RETURNED TO THEM. THEY INSPECTED IT,  AND DETERMINED THAT THE BOLTS WERE LOOSE. I BELIEVE THEY WERE INCORRECT, AND OTHER TRAILERS WILL EXPERIENCE SIMILAR AXLE SEPARATION, PERHAPS CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. THE BOLTS WERE RUSTED AND DIFFICULT TO REMOVE. THE AXLE HAD A PLATE WELDED TO IT WITH HOLES AT THE TOP THAT ATTACH TO THE FRAME WITH BOLTS. NEITHER THE BOLTS NOR THE WELDS SHOWED ANY DAMAGE. RATHER, THERE WAS A GIANT TEAR LOCATED APPROXIMATELY MIDWAY BETWEEN THE WELD ON THE AXLE AND BOLTS THROUGH THE FRAME. IN OTHER WORDS, THE STEEL TORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLATE AWAY FROM EITHER CONNECTION. TESTS WILL DISCOVER  THAT THE STEEL WAS SIMPLY TOO THIN FOR THE BRAKING FORCES OF THE TRAILER. THE TRAILER HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED BECAUSE I AM SURE THE SAME TEAR WILL OCCUR IF THE SAME TOO-THIN STEEL PLATES  WERE USED. PLEASE INSPECT IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I WANT TO HAVE A WELDER DOUBLE THE PLATE BEFORE A NEW AXLE  WAS INSTALLED. IF MY SUPPOSITION WAS  CORRECT THEN THERE WILL BE A SERIOUS INJURY IN THE FUTURE WHEN MORE OF THESE TRAILERS HAVE MORE HOURS ON THEM.
