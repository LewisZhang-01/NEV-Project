I have tried to test this on the road and almost rear ended three cars: 1) speeding up when car in front is at a traffic light, 2) accelerating to 65 mph coming up on a slower car, 3) coming around a curve on a two lane highway with car coming in opposite direction.  No warnings at all.  My Honda Pilot shows the warnings in each of these cases.  So I went back to the dearler and explained that on the Ram forum, https://www.ramforum.com/threads/anyone-else-with-a-fcw-forward-collision-warning-problem.142051/page-3#post-2623613, other drivers have noticed same thing.  My RAM is a 2020.  I saw where someone with a 2019 has same problem.  Also showed the dealer the youtube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SE3irp18ts, so they knew what I was talking about.  They told me they don't have any way to test FC.  I told them I didn't understand how the FCS is not working when the ACC is working perfectly.  This was noted as well in the Ram forum.  This needs to be fix immediately if it was discovered on 2019 vehicles: 1) before someone is badly injured because the FCS doesn't work, and 2) I paid for this safety feature and should have it.",

I pressed the breaks when I heard the explosion and was fortunate no one was in front because there was ice on the road.  Shattered glass was propelled outward but no vehicles were behind me, i was doing 50 on a 55, weather conditions were not great: 20 degrees and snowing pretty bad.  I called the a dealership in Syracuse and they said they don't provide warranty to glass and to call the insurance.  The insurance referred me to a shop in Syracuse (Safelite).  The shop took me in and covered the area with a plastic wrap and told me that the glass won't get in unit l 5 days due to glass shortage.  They also said they had a Chevrolet Silverado and a Ford F150 with the same issue during this week. They mentioned that all of them had one thing in common; rear defrost/heated, motorized slider window.  The shop suggest to only use the defrost for a short period of time.  That if the rear defrost stays on a prolong time it could heat the glass to extreme temperatures causing this scenario.  I was never briefed on this procedure nor does my user manual i dictate such thing. Upon checking online I noticed that this has happened a lot, not only the rear window but the sunroof as well (no defrost option).  I worry about glass particles falling into body parts of the passengers or potential debris hitting other cars behind you .  I have an appointment for Wednesday to get the rear window replaced in a Safelite shop in zip code area 20678 and have to pay a deductible of $250.00 for something that I was not negligence.  I think these are manufacturing defects, nothing hit the glass and scared the heck out of me.  I'm lucky I didn't collide with anyone when I slammed the breaks.",

I  WENT INSIDE TO GET MY HUSBAND WHO CAME OUT AND PULLED IT BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND ENGAGED THE PARKING BRAKE.WE LEFT HOME THE NEXT DAY AND NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE STARTED TO \"CHUG\" AS WE SLOWED DOWN AND TOOK A LEFT TURN. WE CALLED OUR DEALERSHIP AND WERE URGED TO BRING IN THE TRUCK THAT DAY AS THEY STATED THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE. UPON ARRIVING HOME TO UNLOAD EVERYTHING BEFORE HEADING IN, WE PUT THE TRUCK IN PARK. MY HUSBAND AND I EXITED THE VEHICLE (OUR CHILDREN WERE IN THE BACK SEAT) WHEN AT 1:27 PM IT STARTED TO ROLL BACK DOWN OUR DRIVEWAY. AFRAID FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR KIDS, MY HUSBAND QUICKLY JUMPED BACK IN AND APPLIED THE BRAKE MANUALLY. EVEN THOUGH THE TRUCK WAS IN PARK, IF HE TOOK HIS FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE, IT WOULD CONTINUE TO ROLL. ONTUESDAY, JANUARY 19TH, A SERVICE MAN ASKED FOR MY HUSBAND  TO COME IN AND DISCUSS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VIDEO WE SENT IN (RING VIDEO)) AND DO A TEST DRIVE WITH A TECHNICIAN. DURING THE TEST DRIVE THE TECHNICIAN DROVE THE TRUCK AND EXPERIENCED NO ISSUES, AT THIS POINT HE ASKED MY HUSBAND TO SWITCH SEATS AND DRIVE INSTEAD. ON LEVEL GROUND, THE TRUCK WAS PUT IN PARK, THE TECH ASKED HIM TO ENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE AND THEN PUT IT INTO GEAR WITHOUT DISENGAGING THE PARKING BRAKE AND THE TRUCK STARTED TO ROLL FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY, HE HAD HIM DO THE SAME PROCESS IN REVERSE AND HAD THE SAME RESULTS WITH THE TRUCK ROLLING BACKWARDS. AT THIS POINT, THE TECHNICIAN SHARED THE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR OUR FAMILY AND WANTED TO RUN MORE TESTS SINCE THEY WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE SAME ISSUE AS THE VIDEO WE HAD SENT IN ON FLAT GROUND.",

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THAT NIGHT AND FILED A CLAIM WITH FCA. THEY PULLED THE DATA FROM THE TRUCK AND DID AN ANALYSIS.
