THE DEVICES I HAVE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIED THAT LOOSE POWER ARE: HEADLIGHTS, DRL, ABS, WINDSHIELD WIPERS, INTERIOR FAN, FOG LIGHTS.

THIS CAN EASILY HAPPEN (AND DOES HAPPEN) WHILE DRIVING.  SEARCHING YOUR DATABASE OF OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR MODELS WHICH PROBABLY USE THE SAME IGNITION SWITCH REVEALS 15 SWITCH FAILURES (865957, 897162, 876280, 899086, 608861, 609016, 758101, 888070, 8014837, 733016, 607392, 8021547, 869601, 750653, 743422) AND 5 POSSIBLE SWITCH FAILURES (733430, 9002207, 861456, 754763, 750545).  THIS FAILURE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS RECURRANT ENOUGH BY MEMBERS OF WWW.VR6.ORG FOR ONE MEMBER TO ISSUE A STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH.  I FEEL THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD AS HEADLIGHTS AND FOG LIGHTS TURN COMPLETELY OFF WHILE DRIVING (INCLUDING DRL'S) RENDERING THE DRIVER BLIND AT NIGHT.  IF FAILURE OCCURS DURRING DAYLIGHT, THE FAILURE IS NOT AS OBVIOUS BUT RENDERS THE ABS SYSTEM DISABLED AND COULD CAUSE THE DRIVER TO LOOSE CONTROL IF REQUIRED TO STOP QUICKLY WHILE THINKING THE CAR IS EQUIPTED WITH AN ABS SYSTEM.
