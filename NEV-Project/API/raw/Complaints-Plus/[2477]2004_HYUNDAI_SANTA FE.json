I believe the recall should extend till the repair is complete for the reasons as follows.  1. it can explode. 2. it is a polluter 3. Hyundai acknowledges it as faulty equipment.  4. Corporations must be resonsible or they are irresponsible.  5.  Cars are expensive they must maintain as least minimum safety requirements.",

THE NATIONAL OFFICE OF HYUNDAI SOUNDED JUST GREAT ON THE PHONE.  BUT WHEN MY MECHANIC SAID HE WOULD NOT TOUCH THE CAR FOR FEAR OF COMPLICATING THE WARRANTY, NO ONE INCLUDING HYUNDAI WOULD SEND ANYONE TO TOW THE CAR.  AT MY PERSONAL PERIL, I DROVE TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP.  AS I APPROACHED THE RECEPTION AREA, ALL REMAINING GAS GUSHED OUT OF MY CAR.

HER ANSWER WAS: THE DEALER WILL INSPECT AND DO EITHER A SPRING REPLACEMENT IF SEVER DAMAGE IS FOUND OR INSTALL A FRONT SPRING PROTECTION KIT AND SPRAY APPLICATION (OF SOMETHING) IF MODERATE DAMAGE IS FOUND.      I QUESTIONED THE PARAMETERS FOR LEADING TO A DECISION, THE FIRST PERSON I TALKED TO SAID IT WAS THE DEALERS RESPONSIBILITY.

ONE CANNOT JUST EYEBALL A SITUATION LIKE THIS, THERE ARE PARAMETERS FOR THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT.  I FOUND THE SUPERVISORS ANSWER, THAT SHE COULD NOT DIRECT ME TO A CORPORATE ENGINEERING OFFICE FOR SPECIFIC DESIGN PARAMETERS AND THAT THE DEALERS WOULD BE MAKING THE DECISIONS WAS QUESTIONABLE AT BEST IN TERMS OF THEIR ANSWER, WITH NO DEFINED EVALUATIVE CRITERIA AND THEIR RELIABILITY ON THE DEALERS TO MAKE A SAFETY CHOICE OVER A ECONOMIC ONE.

ON A SOMEWHAT COLD DAY IN MARCH 2014, MY 2004 SANTA FE SAT OUTSIDE ON A SURFACE LOT FOR APPROXIMATELY 14 HOURS. AS I PULLED MY CAR OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE, THE CAR LURCHED TO THE FRONT RIGHT AND CAME TO A HALT. I HAD PULLED FORWARD APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET, HAD TURNED THE WHEEL SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT, AND JUST BEGAN TO HIT THE GAS TO PULL OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE. IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT MY FRONT RIGHT TIRE HAD BLOWN VIOLENTLY. NO ACCIDENTS OCCURED WITH OTHER VEHICLES AND NO INJURIES OCCURED; HOWEVER, SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE BEEN STANDING NEAR THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE, SOMEONE MAY HAVE BEEN HURT. WHILE TRYING TO CHANGE THE TIRE, IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE SPRING HAD BROKEN AND MADE CONTACT WITH THE TIRE. THE VEHICLE NEEDED TO BE TOWED ON A FLATBED AND REPAIRS WERE MADE. I STILL OWN THE VEHICLE, AND I AM NOW AWARE THAT THIS PART HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE SPRING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS IT IS CURRENTLY AN ORIGINAL PART.   *TR",

THIS IS A HUGE DISTRACTION TO THE DRIVER AND COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THE CODES ARE P0121 AND P0733 WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH A THROTTLE/ACCELERATOR POSITION SENSOR AND A THIRD GEAR RATIO MISMATCH.    I BELIEVE THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THE ACCELERATOR POSITION SENSOR SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE SYSTEM MODULE WHICH ACTIVATES AN ETS MOTOR ON THE THROTTLE BODY WHICH OPENS/CLOSES THE THROTTLE BUTTERFLY DAMPER BASED ON A COMPUTED ERROR SIGNAL.    UPON RESEARCHING THIS ON HYUNDAI FORUMS IT WAS VERY APPARENT THAT THIS MALFUNCTION IS VERY COMMON AND VERY DANGEROUS.    I SEARCHED THE CURRENT RECALLS AND THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE TWO RECALLS I COULD FIND FOR THIS VEHICLE.    BUT IN 50% OF THE CASES I READ ABOUT IT APPEARED THAT EITHER THE ACCELERATOR SENSOR OR THROTTLE SENSOR IS A COMMON FAILURE.    I REALLY THINK THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.    THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER ITEMS THAT CAN CAUSE THESE SENSORS TO SEE THIS MISMATCH AND GIVE THE ENGINE/TRANSMISSION THE FAULT CODE WHICH CAUSES THE CAR TO EITHER GO INTO \"LIMP\" MODE OR SINGLE GEAR MODE. ALTHOUGH BOTH ARE AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS IT BASICALLY LIMITS THE CAR TO A MAXIMUM RPM AND CAUSES IT TO EITHER RUN IN ONE GEAR OR NOT SHIFT ABOVE A GEAR, FOR EXAMPLE 3RD GEAR INTO OVERDRIVE.    THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON FAULT THAT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHEN RUNNING AT OR NEAR HIGHWAY SPEEDS DUE TO THE UNEXPECTED NATURE OF THE EVENT AND THE SPEED CHANGE AND NOISE IT CAN CAUSE THUS SURPRISING THE DRIVER WHICH MAY CAUSE THEM TO STOP OR PULL OVER UNEXPECTEDLY.    OTHER MALFUNCTIONS THAT CAN CAUSE THIS ARE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR, FUEL INJECTOR O-RING FAULTY AND LEAKY INTAKE MANIFOLDS AMONG OTHERS.    THIS SERIOUS ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND REDESIGNED OR REPAIRED ON THESE VEHICLES.  *TR",

WENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE AND FOUND THE COIL SPRING HAD RUPTURED AND CUT THROUGH THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE. THANK GOD WE WERE NOT TRAVELING ON ANY ROAD OR INTERSTATE HWY., I WOULD NOT BE TELLING THIS.  HYUNDAI MOTORS OF AMERICA, CORPORATE OFFICE WAS NOTIFIED OF MY ISSUE, AND THE FACT THE LEFT SPRING COULD RUPTURE AT ANY TIME. THEY OFFERED IN GOOD FAITH TO PAY FOR RIGHT SPRING AND TIRE, BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE LEFT FRONT SPRING.  HYUNDAI MOTORS OF AMERICA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DEFECTED COIL SPRINGS AND RECALL ALL 2004 SANTA FE TO REPLACE FRONT COIL SPRINGS AND ANY OTHER MECHANICAL SYSTEMS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE RUPTURED COIL SPRINGS.  MANY OWNERS OF 2004 SANTA FE ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, HOPEFULLY HYUNDAI WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE THEIR ARE ANY FATALITIES, GOD BLESS US, AND I PRAY HE WILL KEEP US SAFE!!!!!  *TR",

I WAS STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN, WAITING TO TAKE A LEFT TURN.  AS SOON AS I ACCELERATED AND BEGAN TO TURN, MY VEHICLE SUFFERED A BLOWN-OUT FRONT-PASSENGER SIDE TIRE. AS THE TIRE BLEW OUT, I HEARD A LOUD \"CLUNK\"AND THEN A \"POP\".  SURPRISED, I PULLED THE CAR OVER AS SOON AS I COULD, OFF OF THE MAIN ROAD.  I HAD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COME OUT TO CHANGE THE TIRE, BECAUSE I FOUND THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE TOOLS REQUIRED IN MY CAR TO CHANGE A TIRE.  AFTER THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER PUT ON THE SPARE, I PAID HIM FOR HIS SERVICES AND WENT TO LEAVE.  AS I TURNED THE WHEEL TO LEAVE, MY VEHICLE SUFFERED ANOTHER BLOW-OUT, SAME SIDE.  MY CAR THEN HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST SHOP TO BE LOOKED AT.  TURNS OUT, MY FRONT-RIGHT COIL SPRING SNAPPED AND PIERCED MY TIRE(S).  I CURRENTLY HAVE 73,000 MILES ON MY CAR, WHICH IS A GOOD AMOUNT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, COIL SPRINGS DO NOT JUST SNAP FROM NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  THE VEHICLE IS 7 YEARS OLD, NOT TWENTY.  HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?  I FOUND OUT THAT WHEN THE COIL SPRING SNAPPED, IT ALSO SNAPPED THE STRUTS AND THE STRUT MOUNT, ON TOP OF MY TWO TIRES.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE DAMAGE WAS ABOUT $1200.00, AS BOTH SIDES NEEDED NEW PARTS TO ENSURE THE BEST HANDLING OF THE CAR.  ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS, WHAT IF I WAS ON THE EXPRESSWAY DOING 65?

INITIALLY THERE WAS NO PROBLEM FOUND, BUT I REQUESTED THEY CHECK THE BRAKES AND IT WAS A FAULTY MASTER CYLINDER.  THIS WAS REPLACED.  WITHIN 2 MONTHS, WE WERE PULLING FROM THE DRIVEWAY AND IT APPEARED MY HUSBAND HAD MISTAKENLY PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GAS, HOWEVER WE WERE SURE IT WAS THE BRAKES AND THE ENGINE REVVED UP AND CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD.  WE CALLED AND REPORTED AND THEY SAID WE COULD BRING IT IN FOR SERVICE., HOWEVER THEY RELY ON THE COMPUTER TO INDICATE THE PROBLEM.  NO PROBLEM EXISTED BASED ON THE COMPUTER.  AS RECENT AS SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 2006, MY SON AND I WAS DRIVING AND I WAS PULLING BEHIND A LINE OF CARS THAT WERE STOPPING AT A STOP LIGHT AND THE ENGINE REVVED AS I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES.  THE CAR DID NOT STOP UNTIL I QUICKLY PUT IT IN PARK.  WE TOOK THE CAR IN TODAY, MONDAY, APRIL 10 AND AGAIN, NO PROBLEM BEING FOUND.  I CALLED THE HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHO IS INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT.  MY CONCERN IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT SINCE WE NOW RELY SOLELY ON COMPUTER TO LOCATE PROBLEMS WE MAY NEVER GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED.  I HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE AN ACCIDENT TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED.  *NM",

I WAS MOTIVATED TO DO THIS BASED ON MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE, AS A FORMER OWNER, ALONG WITH THE COUPLED KNOWLEDGE OF HYUNDAI\u0019S IMPROVED WARRANTEES. IN THE PAST I HAD NO REASON TO BRING A HYUNDAI INTO THE SHOP FOR REPAIRS, OTHER THAN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. THE PROBLEM I\u0019M HAVING WITH MY CURRENT VEHICLE IS FOCUSED IN THE DRIVE TRAIN, SPECIFICALLY THE TRANSMISSION. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR APPROXIMATELY 5000 MILES. INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF BREAKING THE CAR IN, AFTER WHICH POINT THINGS WOULD START TO WORK SMOOTHLY. THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS: WHEN THE VEHICLE GETS WARMED UP THE SHIFTING, ON OCCASION BECOMES JERKY. ALSO WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TRANSITIONED FROM PARK TO DRIVE, THE INITIAL TAKEOFF STUTTERS, AS IF THE CAR IS INTERMITTENTLY LOSING POWER. AFTER THE VEHICLE IS UP AND RUNNING IN DRIVE, THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY. IT ONLY OCCURS FOR THE FIRST 20 YARDS OF INITIAL TAKEOFFS. THE PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE INTERMITTENT.     KNOWING THAT THE VEHICLE IS COVERED UNDER HYUNDAI\u0019S WARRANTEE, I TOOK IT IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. PRIOR TO THIS, I SPOKE WITH ONE OF THE SHOPS MANAGERS AND DESCRIBED MY PROBLEM. HE INDICATED TO ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLLER. I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AND HIS REPLY WAS YES. AFTER THE MECHANIC ROAD-TESTED MY VEHICLE THEY CAME TO ME AND SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I SAID, AFTER I LEAVE HERE IT\u0019S GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT THE SAME PROBLEMS, REQUIRING A RETURN VISIT. HE REPLIED, YES. I ASKED IF THEY COULD REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLLER BOARD. THEY REPLIED THAT THEY COULD NOT JUST \u001cTHROW PARTS AT MY CAR IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. *AK",

UPON DRIVING I FELT A HARD KNOCKING-VIBRATING SOUND WHEN I DRIVE ON LOCAL (DRY) STREETS AND THEN A FEELING THAT THE CAR JUMPS (LUNGE FORWARDS)AFTER I STOP.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I THOUGHT SOMEONE HIT ME FROM BEHIND.  THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN ONLY WHEN I DRIVE LOCALLY.  THE CAR HAS NEVER DONE THIS ON THE HIGHWAY, WHICH IS PART OF MY DAILY COMMUTE. I WASN'T SURE WHY AT FIRST, THE CAR DID THAT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THE TRACKING CONTROL SYSTEM(4-WHEEL DRIVE EVEN THOUGH THE ROAD CONDITIONS WERE DRY.  IN EVERY INCIDENT, THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS NOT GOING TO STOP, BUT IT DOES.  I AM AFRAID BECAUSE WHEN THE CAR JUMPS AND IF I GET TOO CLOSE TO SOMEONE IT CAN HIT A CAR IN FRONT OF ME, OR EVEN A PERSON CROSSING.  SO, I WAS HAPPY RECEIVE MY RECALL NOTICE STATING THE EXACT PROBLEM I WAS GOING THROUGH  I THEN CALLED AND TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND TOLD THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I HOPED THE PROGRAMMING WOULD WORK SINCE MY PROBLEM WAS SIMILAR TO THE RECALL SYMPTOMS.  THAT IS WHEN THIS NIGHTMARE BEGAN AND IT WAS ON APRIL 9, 2004.  SINCE THEN, THE DEALER HAS BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE BUT THEY SEEM AT A LOSS ALSO.  MY CAR WAS PROGRAMMED TWICE AND THEN THE ABS SENSOR REPLACED AND A CHIP ALSO(THIS WAS DONE LAST MONDAY).  I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR 5 TIMES AS OF TODAY.  MY CAR CONTINUES TO DO THE KNOCKING/GRINDING SOUND AND ON 2 OCCASIONS THE LAST BEING ON MAY 29;  THE ABS, TCS AND THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE LIGHTS ON THE INTERIOR CONTROL PANEL HAVE FLICKERED AND STAYED ON AS WELL.  (WHEN THIS HAPPENED MY CAR DID THE KNOCKING/VIBRATING NOISE AS WELL.)  IT HAS BECOME A DAILY OCCURANCE SO NOW I AM DOCUMENTING ALL OF MY INCIDENTS AND I AM GETTING AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR.  SO TODAY I GAVE MY CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WILL CONTACT THE MAIN OFFICE AT HYUNDAI.  ALL PARTS AND SERVICE WERE NOT CHARGED AND REPLACED WITH NEW HYUNDAI PARTS.*AK",
