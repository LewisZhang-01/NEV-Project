        "summary": "I brought in my car in to Roger Williams Chrysler in Weatherford TX, 1102 Washington Dr, Weatherford, TX 76086, for Safety Recall R06. The first appointment I dropped off the vehicle and received a rental, which was covered by FCA under the recall. A couple of days pass as they order parts and perform the maintenance. I return to my vehicle once they stated the Safety Recall was completed. The airbag light was still on, they couldn't tell me what DTC was associated with the light so I checked it myself. The DTC's were airbag DTC 54 and 55 (Side impact sensor internal fault). Safety Recall R06 instructs the dealership to replace impact sensors should they have any DTC's on them. R06 also states, at least twice, NOT to replace the front impact sensors, which they boasted and were proud about replacing. They stated \"the tech has done hundreds of these recalls and always replaces the front sensors\". I explained why I felt the recall maintenance was not completed to the tech when I picked up my vehicle. He maintained his narrative that the recall was satisfied and if I wanted them to look into it further it would be a minimum of $300.00. As weeks go by while I work with FCA customer care and the dealership service manager I am forced to drive a vehicle with faulty airbags. After several weeks and numerous phone calls and arguing I convinced the dealership to take another look at the vehicle. Upon their second look they initially maintained that the recall was satisfied and that the front sensors were replaced. I pleaded with the service manager once more to check the DTC's and review the NHTSA/FCA Safety Recall R06 instructions to replace the side impact sensors. They finally do, now the vehicles airbags are functioning and all is well. I just wonder, how many hundreds of WJ's are out there that had this maintenance done incorrectly and either don't know or didn't push hard enough to have it done correctly. How was this even able to get to this point?",

THE TOW OPERATOR WHO RESPONDED ATTEMPTED TO START THE ENGINE BUT FOUND THE SAME RESULT ' RUNAWAY ENGINE REVS.  THE JEEP WAS TOWED TO DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT EVENING.    THE NEXT MORNING, SERVICE ADVISOR INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED THAT THE THROTTLE PEDAL WAS STUCK DOWN TO THE FLOOR.  HE LOOSENED IT BY MANIPULATION. THE THROTTLE BUTTERFLY VALVE WAS FOUND TO BE STUCK IN THE OPEN POSITION BY A SHREDDED PIECE OF RUBBER THAT FLAKED OFF THE RESONATOR BODY INTAKE CONNECTOR.  SERVICE DEPARTMENT PERFORMED: 'RUBBER FROM INTAKE SEAL STUCK THROTTLE BODY.  REMOVED DEBRIS'.  THE TECHNICIAN SHOWED ME THE PIECE OF SHREDDED RUBBER AND GAVE IT TO ME.  I KEPT IT, AND THE ENTIRE DEFECTIVE RESONATOR BODY, IN MY POSSESSION.   THERE MAY BE OTHER REPORTS OF RUNAWAY ENGINE REVS BUT THIS INSTANCE SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE DESIGN OF THE RESONATOR INTAKE PATHWAY.   ALTHOUGH MY JEEP HAS 246,289 MILES ON IT, THE DEFECT WAS NOT A RESULT OF WEAR BUT SEEMS TO BE RESULT OF DEFECTIVE DESIGN. THE INTAKE AIR PATHWAY IS SUBJECT TO SHREDDING RUBBER PARTS WHICH CAN COME LOOSE, ENTER THE INTAKE AIR PATHWAY AND BLOCK THE THROTTLE BUTTERFLY.  THIS SEEMS TO BE AN UNNECESSARILY HAZARDOUS DESIGN.",

I TOLD HIM MY FACTORY INSTALLED TOW HITCH DID NOT CUT IT AND THAT I WANTED HIM TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE IN MY VEHICLE AND THE ONES IN THE RECALL. HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND PROVIDED ME WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER SO THAT I COULD FILE A COMPLAINT.     INSTEAD I SENT AN EMAIL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A RESPONSE WITHIN 24 HOURS. I AM STILL WAITING.

I SAW THE TODAY SHOW ON NBC ON MONDAY MORNING AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION AND CHRYSLER WOULD COVER THE COST TO FIX THE VEHICLES OR THEY WOULD HAVE TO OFFER OVER MARKET VALUE ON A TRADE IN FOR A DIFFERENT VEHICLE, OR BUY BACK CERTAIN VEHICLES.     CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH SOME ANSWERS.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SHOWED NO COMPRESSION IN THE FIRST CYLINDER.  I WAS UNABLE TO PAY TO HAVE MY ENGINE TORN APART (KEEP IN MIND I ONLY HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND STILL OWED OVER $1000 ON SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT DRIVEABLE), BUT FROM THE SYMPTOMS IT SEEMS THIS WAS CAUSED BY A DROPPED VALVE SEAT.  I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE IN THIS ENGINE (IN JEEPS AND OTHER CHRYSLER VEHICLES) AND AM SURPRISED THAT NO RECALL HAS BEEN MADE.

BECAUSE OF THIS, I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PASSENGER HEATED SEAT. I FOUND OUT FROM A DEALER THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, BUT MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT COVERED. I CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CARE TO DISCUSS THIS, AND THEY SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO HELP.

ON DECEMBER 16,2013, ONE YEAR LATER, I CALLED BOTH PAMBY'S CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP (WHERE WE TAKE OUR CAR FOR SERVICE) AND THE CORPORATE OFFICES FOR CHRYSLER TO REPORT THAT OUR AIRBAG LIGHT IS NOW ON PERMANENTLY. WE WERE AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THE AIR BAG  MIGHT  DEPLOY WHILE WE ARE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. BOTH PAMBY'S AND CHRYSLER HAVE STATED THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PART-ONE YEAR LATER!  I GAVE ALL OF MY CONTACT INFORMATION TO CHRYSLER WITH A PROMISE THAT MY CONCERNS WOULD BE ADDRESSED VIA EMAIL. NO ONE HAS CONTACTED ME.NOW I HAVE RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL  RECALL FOR THE TRAILER HITCH AS IT CAUSES FIRES!  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO REPAIR THIS? WE HAVE OWNED  JEEPS FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS BUT WITH THE NEW \"WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY\" ATTITUDE, WE WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.  *TR",

AT 80,000 MILES, I WAS LEAVING FOR SCHOOL WHEN I NOTICED MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW HAD FALLEN INTO THE DOOR.  WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE SWITCH TO RAISE THE WINDOW, IT DID NOT WORK.  I TOOK THIS CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE WINDOW REGULATOR, AND THEY FIXED IT TO THE TUNE OF $400.  THE DEALERSHIP KNEW WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FIXED SO MANY, AND THE NOVICE INTERNET SURFER WOULD BE ABLE TO SEARCH OUT THIS PROBLEM AND FIND A MYRIAD OF COMPLAINTS FROM GRAND CHEROKEE AND LIBERTY OWNERS ALIKE.  I UNDERSTAND A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN CALIFORNIA BY JEEP LIBERTY DRIVERS, AND JEEP HAS SINCE EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON LIBERTY WINDOWS.  JEEP REIMBURSED ME $300 OF THE $400 DOLLARS FOR THIS FIRST INCIDENT.  NOW, LAST SUNDAY, I WAS LEAVING MY HOME TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT AT THE HOSPITAL, AND I NOTICED THE PASSENGER WINDOW WAS ROLLED ALL THE WAY DOWN - SURE ENOUGH, THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE OTHER WINDOW.  I DROVE TO WORK IN A SNOW STORM WITH THE PASSENGER WINDOW ROLLED DOWN.  NOW JEEP WILL NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REGULATOR, WHICH AGAIN COST $400 TO REPLACE.  AGAIN, MY NEW JEEP DEALERSHIP, FLETCHER AUTO IN COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE SEEN IT OFTEN WITH VEHICLES FROM THIS TIME PERIOD.  I URGE YOU TO ACT TO CREATE A RECALL FOR THIS KNOWN DEFECTIVE PART THAT HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE AND EXPENSE.  I WAS NOT IN DANGER, BUT I HAD TO BE AT WORK TO COVER MY SHIFT, SO I DROVE IN THE STORM AND HAD TO LEAVE MY CAR IN AN OPEN AIR UNGUARDED PARKING GARAGE WITH THE WINDOW DOWN ALL NIGHT.   I BELIEVE JEEP SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS.  I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT PROVIDING MY VIN#, I AM ACTUALLY WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW FOR ANOTHER SHIFT.  *TR",

THIS SYSTEM BREAKDOWN CAN OCCUR SUDDENLY, AND CAN AFFECT BOTH THE A/C AND HEATING SYSTEMS. WHEN THIS OCCURRED TO MY 2002 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LTD. IT WAS IN THE DEAD OF WINTER (DEC 2009) AND THE WEATHER HAD BEEN EXTREMELY COLD. I WAS UNABLE TO PROPERLY DEFROST MY WINDOWS, CAUSING EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN SEEING OUT OF MY WINDSHIELD AND RIGHT SIDE MIRROR. BECAUSE OF THIS I WAS OFTEN HAVING TO ROLL DOWN MY WINDOWS--EVEN IF IT WAS SNOWING--IN ORDER TO DRIVE SAFELY TO SCHOOL AND WORK. IN MARCH I TOOK MY CAR TO A LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THIS ISSUE AND I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM IN MANY JEEPS, AND IS SEEN VERY FREQUENTLY. DUE TO THE PROBLEM BEING IN THE DASH OF THE VEHICLE, THE REPAIR QUOTE IS OVER $1,300.00, AND IS NOT COVERED BY MY PRE-OWNED VEHICLE PROTECTION PLAN  WITH WESTERN GENERAL. DAIMLER-CHRYSLER HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE BUT REFUSES TO RECALL A WARRANTY OR ASSIST JEEP OWNERS IN REPAIRING BROKEN PARTS.

PRIOR TO THE SHOP APPOINTMENT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, I ASKED THE SERVICE TECH TO CHECK WHY THE HEATER WAS NOT WORKING AND WHY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.

HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE HEATER PLUGS WERE MELTED AND IT NEEDED A WIRING HARNESS REPLACEMENT. THE DASH GETS VERY HOT WHICH HAS MELTED THE PLUGS BUT NO HEAT IS BLOWING INTO THE VEHICLE. THIS COULD CAUSE A FIRE INSIDE THE VEHICLE. ALSO THE LEAK DETECTION PUMP IS AN EMISSIONS PROBLEM AND PER FEDERALLAW HAS TO BE OPERATING IN ORDER TO PASS INSPECTION.

THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS HAD BEEN LOWERED TO HELP COOL THE INSIDE PRIOR TO DRIVING.  WHEN THE WINDOWS WERE RAISED, ONLY THE FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW RESPONDED.

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE RESPECTIVE SUB-ASSEMBLY BE INSTALLED IF A BLEND AIR DOOR(S), A RECIRCULATION DOOR, A DOOR LINK, OR A SUB-ASSEMBLY HOUSING REQUIRES REPLACEMENT. THESE NEW PARTS COST LESS THAN $200 ACCORDING TO THE BULLETIN, BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER EXPECTS THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PICK UP THE TAB ON A DESIGN FLAW. ESPECIALLY A DESIGN FLAW THAT IS SO LABOR INTENSIVE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PARTS ARE LESS THAN $200, THE FINAL BILL WILL BE MORE THAN $1,000. A JOB SO CONSUMING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WISE TO HAVE IT SERVICED BY ANYTHING BUT A JEEP SERVICE TECHNICIAN. NOT TO MENTION SOME REPAIR SHOPS WONT EVEN TAKE ON THE JOB DUE TO THE TIME AND POSSIBLE ACCOUNTABILITY OF SUCH A PROJECT. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE; NOT ONLY BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO DEFROST BUT OF THE EFFECTS EXTREME COLD CAN HAVE ON A BODY TOO.  THE NHTSB NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS WITH DAIMLER CHRYLSER.  *TR",

        "summary": "IN THE FALL OF 2006, THE HEAT IN MY 2002 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE STOPPED WORKING.  I DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH AND THIS PROBLEM WAS SO COMMON THAT I EASILY FOUND PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT WERE ABLE TO SELF-DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM USING THE JEEP'S INTERNAL COMPUTER TO OUTPUT THE SYSTEM FAULTS.  USING THE SAME METHOD TO ENTER THE AZC SELF-DIAGNOSTIC MODE, THE CLIMATE CONTROL DISPLAY OUTPUTTED THE SYSTEM FAULT CODES 52-54-56.  SINCE MOST OF THE CONSUMERS I'VE RUN INTO WITH THIS PROBLEM GET THAT EXACT CODE, OR HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM DIAGNOSED BY A JEEP DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I ALREADY KNOW THAT IT WILL COST ANYWHERE FROM $1000+ TO BE REPAIRED, THE MAJORITY OF IT BEING LABOR AS THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT PANEL ASSEMBLY HAS TO BE REMOVED.        TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, DAIMLER-CHRYSLER RELEASED TSB 2400104 - NEW HVAC SUB-ASSEMBLY REPLACES BLEND OR RECIRC DOOR COMPONENTS.  EACH NEW SUB-ASSEMBLY CONSISTS OF SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS. THE NEW SUB-ASSEMBLIES IMPROVE COMPONENT RELIABILITY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE RESPECTIVE SUB-ASSEMBLY BE INSTALLED IF A BLEND AIR DOOR(S), A RECIRCULATION DOOR, A DOOR LINK, OR A SUB-ASSEMBLY HOUSING REQUIRES REPLACEMENT.  THESE NEW PARTS COST LESS THAN $200 ACCORDING TO THE BULLETIN, BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER EXPECTS THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PICK UP THE TAB ON A DESIGN FLAW.  ESPECIALLY A DESIGN FLAW THAT IS SO LABOR INTENSIVE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PARTS ARE LESS THAN $200, THE FINAL BILL WILL BE MORE THAN $1,000.  A JOB SO CONSUMING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WISE TO HAVE IT SERVICED BY ANYTHING BUT A JEEP SERVICE TECHNICIAN.  NOT TO MENTION SOME REPAIR SHOPS WON'T EVEN TAKE ON THE JOB DUE TO THE TIME AND POSSIBLE ACCOUNTABILITY OF SUCH A PROJECT.  TO MAKE A VEHICLE WHERE THE HEAT DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY IS UNACCEPTABLE AND MOST LIKELY DANGEROUS.  NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS EXTREME COLD CAN HAVE ON A BODY, BUT ALSO DUE TO THE HEAT BEING USED FOR DEFROSTING.  IT COST $884.00 TO REPAIR. *TR",

I OWN A 2002 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEELLIMITED WITH DUAL HEAT ZONE. I RECENTLY LOST HEAT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. NOW YOU ASK HOW IS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE? WELL WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON DEFROST YOU HAVE HEAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND ICE COLD AIR BLOWING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. (REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE DEFROSTER ON THE A/C PUMP CIRCULATES WHICH CAUSES VERY COLD AIR TO BLOW) NOW ONLY PART OF YOUR WINDSHIELD IS CLEARING UP. I LIVE IN CENTRAL PA WHERE THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS CHANGING. ESPECIALLY IN THE FALL AND SPRING. THIS TEMPERATURE CHANGE CAN CAUSE THE WINDSHIELD TO FOG UP RATHER QUICKLY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S DAMP AND THERE ARE WARM BODIES IN THE CAR. THIS CAN OCCUR WHEN YOUR DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT ANY TIME. I WORK FOR NAPA AUTO PARTS AND TRAVEL IN 3 STATES. I'M A FORMER VEHICLE TECHNICIAN AND KNOW A LOT OF REPAIR SHOPS. I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT HOW MANY OF THESES REPAIR SHOP KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND SAID THAT THIS IS VERY COMMON. THEY ALSO STATED THAT IT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND VERY COSTLY TO REPAIR. MOST DEALERSHIP STOCK THE PARTS TO REPAIR THIS. THIS ALONE SHOULD THROW UP A RED FLAG! THE BLEND DOORS WERE DESIGNED VERY CHEAPLY AND WE THE CONSUMER HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. ANYONE CAN SEE THE HAZARD HERE THE QUESTION IS, WILL SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING BEFORE THERE IS A DEATH? ( THERE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOME, BUT NOBODY  WILL EVER KNOW IF THE  PERSON IS DEAD!). NOW YOU KNOW WHY THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS WEBSITE. YOU WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE IF THEY DID.  *TR",

AFTER TRYING VARIOUS SETTINGS, ALL THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IS TO BLOW COLD (AMBIENT) AIR (CURRENTLY 4F) OUT OF THE VARIOUS VENTS/DEFROSTER. THIS DOES VERY, VERY  LITTLE TO REMOVE FROST FROM THE WINDSHIELD.   ADDITIONALLY, THE HEATER CORE HAS BEGUN FAILING. THIS RELEASES ADDITIONAL MOISTURE INTO THE CABIN, CAUSING EVEN WORSE FOGGING (FROSTING THIS TIME OF YEAR). THIS COMBINATION OF FAILURES RENDERS THE DEFROSTER TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE, AND REQUIRES THE DANGEROUS ACT OF WIPING OR SCRAPING THE INSIDE OF THE WINDOW ABOUT EVERY 5 MINUTES UNDER NORMAL WINTER CONDITIONS.     I AM INFORMED THAT THIS CONDITION IS CAUSED BY THE BREAKAGE OF \"MIX DOORS\" IN THE HVAC SYSTEM, A KNOWN DEFECTIVE \"WEAK PART\" THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING REPLACED (AT CUSTOMER EXPENSE) ON VIRTUALLY ALL 1999-2004 GRAND CHEROKEES WITH AUTOMATIC CLIMATE CONTROLS.

WE WERE OUT TO DINNER AND THE WINDOW RIGHT NEXT TO THE INFANT CAR SEAT HAD FALLEN INTO THE DOOR AND A VERY COLD NIGHT IT WAS.  ON OUR WAY HOME, THE OTHER WINDOW HAD FALLEN INTO THE DOOR.  NOW THERE IS NO WAY TO PROTECT THE BABY IN THE BACK IN THE BABY SEAT STRAPPED IN WITH TWO OPEN WINDOWS BLOWING COLD AIR AT HIM.  WHAT IF HIS CAR SEAT WOULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN WHEN WE WERE IN THE RESTAURANT???  HOW WOULD HAVE WE GOT HIM HOME SAFELY.  WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN RAINING OR SNOWING ON HIM ALL THE WAY HOME??  WHAT IF I WAS RIDING ALONE AND HAD BEEN CAR JACKED??  WHAT IF WAS REALLY INCLEMENT WEATHER AFFECTING THE INSIDE OF MY VEHICLE ALL THAT NIGHT AND NOT KNOWING THAT THE WINDOWS HAD FALLEN INTO THE DOORS???  I REALLY DON'T FEEL SAFE TAKING THE BABY IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLE WITH ME ANY MORE.  WHY DID I PAY SO MUCH MONEY FOR THE \"VALUED JEEP\"  I PURCHASED WHEN SO MUCH IS GOING WRONG WITH IT.

THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COOLING FAN WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAD RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND LEARNED FROM YOUR WEBSITE THAT ON JUNE 6TH,, 2006 CHRYSLER GROUP ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS RECALLING OUR JEEPS COOLING FAN FOR POTENTIAL SEPARATION OF THE FAN BLADES (ATTACHMENT).  I TOLD OUR REPAIR ADVISOR OF THE ANNOUNCED RECALL AND DESPITE HAVING AN UNRELATED PROBLEM WITH THE FAN I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY TO REPLACE A PART THAT CHRYSLER WAS GOING TO REPLACE PER THE RECALL.  HE TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE CHRYSLER HAD NOT COMPLETED THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RECALL I WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRS BUT WOULD BE REIMBURSED WHEN THE RECALL MADE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM.    ON AUGUST 30, CHRYSLER COMPLETED THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RECALL; I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND WAS REACHED BY A CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE BY TELEPHONE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE REIMBURSED FOR REPAIRS BECAUSE THE RECALL NOTIFICATION OCCURRED AUGUST 30 AND I HAD REPLACED THE RECALLED FAN JUNE 22ND FOR AN UNRELATED PROBLEM.  I STATED THAT THE RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED JUNE 6TH; I REPLACED THE FAN AFTER THAT DATE; MY STATEMENT FELL ON DEAF EARS.    I BELIEVE CHRYSLER IS FAILING TO LIVE UP TO THE RECALL; CHRYSLER SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE COOLING FAN PLUS LABOR BECAUSE I HAD REPLACED IT AT MY EXPENSE MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE RECALL WAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED.  I SHOULD NOT BE CASTIGATED BECAUSE CHRYSLER TOOK GREATER THAN TWO MONTHS TO ADMINISTER THE RECALL.  PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH WHAT YOU FEEL IS THE PROPER REMEDY.  *JB",

        "summary": "I AM CONTACTING THE NHTSA DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW IN THE HVAC SYSTEM OF OF 1999 - 2004 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES.  THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS THE EXACT SAME ONE THAT COUNTLESS OTHERS HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION. WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM DUE TO THE WEAK BLEND AND RECIRCULATION DOORS IN THE HVAC SYSTEMS. THE DOORS ARE TURNED BY A MOTOR ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR AT THE END OF A HINGE SHAFT. THE MOTOR STOPS TURNING WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH PHYSICAL RESISTANCE FROM THE DOOR STOPPING AGAINST ITS HOUSING. THIS PUTS STRESS ON THE SHAFT/DOOR JUNCTION AND OVER TIME STRIPS THE SHAFT SO THAT IT SPINS ALMOST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE DOOR.     TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, DAIMLER-CHRYSLER RELEASED TSB 2400104 - NEW HVAC SUB-ASSEMBLY REPLACES BLEND OR RECIRC DOOR COMPONENTS. THESE NEW PARTS COST LESS THAN $200 ACCORDING TO THE BULLETIN, BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER EXPECTS THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PICK UP THE TAB ON A DESIGN FLAW.  ESPECIALLY A DESIGN FLAW THAT IS SO LABOR INTENSIVE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PARTS ARE LESS THAN $200, THE FINAL BILL WILL BE IN THE $1,000 AREA.    BECAUSE IT IS NO RECALL FOR THIS, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS FALLS TO THE CONSUMER, DESPITE THIS BEING A VERY OBVIOUS CASE OF BAD DESIGN.    THERE WERE NO EVENTS LEADING UP TO THIS FAILURE OTHER THAN DAIMLER CHRYSLER SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT TO THE PUBLIC.  A DEFECT THAT EFFECTS A VERY BASIC NECESSITY - HEAT.  THIS FAILURE RESULTS IN NOT ONLY AN UNACCEPTABLE COMFORT FACTOR, BUT ALSO EFFECTS VISIBILITY WHEN HOT AIR NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE FRONT WIND SHIELD TO ELIMINATE FOGGING.  AS OF THIS TIME, I AM WAITING FOR A RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE BEFORE I CONSIDER SPENDING OVER $1,000 ON A DESIGN FLAW. *JB",

AFTER CONTINUED USE PER THE DEALERS REFUSAL TO FIX THIS ISSUE AND CLAIMING THAT THIS IS A NORMAL BEHAVIOR OF THE GEAR BOX FOR THIS MODEL, I AM NOW EXPERIENCING POOR AND UNSAFE HANDLING OF MY JEEP. THE STEERING COLUMN WHEN SUBJECTED TO BUMPS OR HOLES IN THE ROADWAY WILL BEHAVE OR RESPOND IN AN ERRATIC FASHION TO THE POINT THAT THE VEHICLE FEELS LIKE YOU ARE ABOUT TO LOOSE CONTROL OF YOUR VEHICLE. IN WET OR SNOWY CONDITIONS THIS HAS RESULTED IN NEAR SIDE CRASHES WITH OTHER CARS ALONG SIDE MINE, BECAUSE THE SLIPPERY CONDITIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CONTROL YOU HAVE WITH YOUR VEHICLE AND HAVING A LOOSE OR NON-COOPERATIVE STEERING GEAR BOX MAKES THIS HAZARD EVEN WORSE. MY VEHICLE IS THE V6 MODEL, ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, ''CHRYSLER PUT AN OLDER VERSION OF A GEARBOX SYSTEM THAT IS NOT FOUND IN THE V8 MODELS''. THE LONGER I DRIVE THIS VEHICLE THE LOOSER THE STEERING COLUMN FEELS AND THE LOUDER THE TAPPING SOUND HAS BECOME. IN ADDITION THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE ASSEMBLY STEERING BARS TO LOOSEN AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE TOTAL LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE TWICE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER, THAT WHEN DRIVING AT 55 MPH THE STEERING COLUMN WILL JERK SEVERALLY, ACCORDING TO THE DEALER WAS A SIGN THAT THE JOINTS AT THE END OF THE ASSEMBLY BARS WAS LOOSE AND REQUIRED REPAIR WORK.

IN DECEMBER OF 2003, I PULLED INTO A CHRYSLER SERVICE CENTER TO HAVE MY TRUCK SERVICED IN NJ, BECAUSE IT WAS DRIVING IMPROPERLY, AND NOT GETTING UP TO ITS NORMAL SPEED PROPERLY.  I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS UNTIL A CHRYSLER JEEP DEALER IDENTIFIED THE TRUCK AS HAVING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  AT THE TIME THE TRUCK ONLY HAD 35,000 MILES ON IT. SINCE I WAS UNABLE GET ANY ASSISTANCE WITH MY VEHICLE FROM CHRYSLER, I WAS FORCED TO CALL AAA, A RELIABLE SERVICE AND PROVIDER TO TOW MY TRUCK.  WHEN THE AAA TOW MAN ARRIVED HE INFORMED ME THAT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY SHIFT GEAR/TRANSMISSION.   I IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED WITH GREAT SKEPTICISM, AS CHRYSLER'S SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ASSURED ME THAT I NO LONGER SHOULD EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY TRANSMISSION.  THE AAA REPRESENTATIVE WHOM WAS SENT TO TOW MY TRUCK MANAGED TO GET MY TRUCK STARTED AND I WAS ON MY WAY ONCE MORE.  THE NEXT DAY I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM OF THE RECENT PROBLEMS I WAS EXPERIENCING AND IMMEDIATELY THEY CHECKED THE TRUCK IN.  WHEN THE TRUCK WAS BEING CHECKED I NOTIFIED THE MECHANIC THAT THE TRUCK WOULD ONLY START IN NEUTRAL. I ALSO BROUGHT IT TO THEIR ATTENTION; A NEW PROBLEM THAT THE TRUCK WAS EXPERIENCING.  THE TRUCK ROLLED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHILE IN THE PARKING GEAR. AT THIS POINT, AS A VALUED CONSUMER, I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS TRUCK WITH NO PENALTIES, BE REIMBURSED FOR THE CAR RENTAL AND POSSIBLY CONTINUE A LEASE ON ANOTHER VEHICLE OTHER THAN A CHEROKEE.

WHEN THE DEALERSHIP SAID NEITHER THEY NOR CHRYSLER WOULD HELP WITH THE REPAIR COSTS, I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH CHRYSLER.  THE PERSON I SPOKE TO THERE WAS MICHAEL.

HE SAID THE COMPANY DID NOT CARE AND WOULD NOT HELP FIX THE PROBLEM TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SIMPLE FIX, SIMPLY PUT A WASHER ON TOP OF THE CRUSH NUT THEY USE AND THE BACKING PIECE BECOMES TOO LARGE TO PULL THROUGH THE HOLE AND THUS GIVES THE TOP A MORE SECURE FOOTING AND SUPPORT.  THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, DOES NOT WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THEY ONLY WANT TO PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS.

WHAT KIND OF A DEAL IS THAT? ONE PERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR DOWNWARD PRESSURE ONLY.  THAT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR PUTTING WEIGHT ON THE RAILS, BUT HOW DOES ONE STRAP DOWN THE CARGO TO KEEP IT UP THERE WITHOUT STRAPPING IT DOWN USING THE SIDE RAILS?  I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THAT THIS CAN POTENTIALLY KILL SOMEONE!  WHY NOT JUST REPAIR IT TO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE?

JEEP APPARENTLY ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN TO ITS AUTHORIZED REPAIR FACILITIES INDICATING THAT THE ROTORS, PADS, AND CALIPERS WERE GENERATING EXCESSIVE HEAT BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH GAS WAS BEING VENTED OFF DURING BRAKING.  THE TSB ADVISED TO REPLACED THE ROTORS, PADS, AND CALIPERS.  WHEN WE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL JEEP DEALER ABOUT SOME VIBRATION IN THE DRIVE TRAIN DURING BRAKING, WE WERE SIMPLY TOLD THAT THE BRAKE PADS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  FURTHER QUESTIONS LED US TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH WAS THE TOPIC OF THE TSB.  JEEP CLAIMED IT WAS NOT A \"PROBLEM\", AND THEY SAID AS IT WAS RELATED TO THE BRAKES, IT WAS NO LONGER A WARRANTY ITEM.  THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE SEEING THIS PROBLEM ON \"A LOT\" OF 2002'S.  I FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT TELLING CONSUMERS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, THEY ARE JUST REPLACING THE ITEMS, BILLING THE CONSUMER FOR THE COST OF THE ROTORS, AND CALLING IT GOOD.  IN MY OPINION, A PROPERLY MANUFACTURED SYSTEM SHOULD NOT LEAD TO BRAKE ROTOR WARPING UNDER NORMAL OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS JEEP HAS 26,000 MILES ON IT, AND THE PADS SHOW THE AMOUNT OF WEAR I WOULD EXPECT AT THIS STAGE.  WHEN I QUESTIONED JEEP CORPORATE ABOUT THE ISSUE, THEY ADVISED THAT SINCE NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED, THEY SEE NO NEED TO COVER THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE QUIETLY REPLACING THESE BRAKE CALIPERS,PADS, AND ROTORS WITHOUT TELLING THE CONSUMER, JUST SO THAT NO COMPLAINTS ARE FILED, AND THEN, NO RECALL.  BRAKES ARE A CRUCIAL SAFETY FACTOR IN A FAMILY VEHICLE, AND MY COMPLAINT IS THAT JEEP SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT BETTER.  THIS CLEARLY IS A MANUFACTURING/DESIGN FLAW, WHICH THEY EVEN RECOGNIZE (THUS, THE TSB).*AK",

ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT (5/22/02), I NOTICED A CAR 40-50 YARDS IN FRONT OF ME HALF WAY INTO A RIGHT TURN.  I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND WITHIN 10-15 YARDS OF THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME, I REALIZED THAT THE CAR WAS MOVING FORWARD EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE.  IN ORDER TO AVOID HITTING THE OTHER CAR FLUSH FROM THE REAR, I SWERVED THE JEEP TO THE LEFT AND STRUCH HIS LEFT REAR LIGHT A GLANCING BLOW.  AT THAT POINT I STOPPED THE CAR BY REAPPLYING MY FOOT TO THE BRAKE. I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH.  I TOOK THE CAR IN TO BUERGE  CHRYSLER JEEP, THE BRAKES SYSTEM WAS EXAMINED BY MY SERVICE MAN WHO AGREED WITH ME THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL IS VERY SOFT AND WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.  I ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE BRAKE FLUID WAS LOW.  HE SAID THAT CHRYSLER WOULD BRING IN AN INDEPENDANT INVESTIGATOR.  ON WED. 5/29/02, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE INVESTIGATOR WHO SAID THAT HIS REPORT WOULD BE SUBMITTED IN 10 DAYS.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR SAID THE CAR COULD BE RELEASED TO ME AND THAT, IN FACT, THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS THAT HE COULD FIND.  I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO REEXAMINE THE CAR AND DRIVE WITH ME, AND HE SAID THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THESE SITUATIONS WERE A DEFECT IS INTERMITTANT AND IS NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS.
