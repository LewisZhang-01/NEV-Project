I CHECKED THAT AND IT WAS BLOWN.  I NOTIFIED SUBARU A MONTH AGO AND HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  IT SEEMS THOUGH THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN THE MANUAL AS IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS SITUATION.  THE SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT WITH BOTH FAN FUSES BLOWN THE VEHICLE CAN STOP DUE TO AN OVERHEAT AT AN UNEXPECTED TIME AND CAUSE AND ENGINE FAILURE THAT CAN LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT.  THE NUMBER 25 IS ACTUALLY A SPARE FUSE AREA AND DOES NOT HAVE AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTION BUT THE NUMBER 22 IS A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION WITH A VEHICLE THAT HAS AN ACCESSORY POWER SOCKET IN SOME VEHICLE.
