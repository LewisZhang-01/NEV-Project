I CALLED FORD AND WAS TOLD IT DIDN'T INCLUDE MY VIN #  I DID SOME FURTHER RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THESE AXLES WERE MANUFACTURED WITH A DEFECT CAUSING THE METAL TO BECOME SOFT THEREBY CAUSING THE WHEEL BEARING TO WEAR AN INDENTATION INTO THE METAL RESULTING IN THE WHEEL BEARING HAVING TO MUCH PLAY ON THE AXLE (TO MUCH MOVEMENT). THE END RESULT IS THE BEARING DESTROYS ITSELF AND HOPEFULLY YOU REPLACE IT BEFORE IT BREAKS APART CAUSING THE WHEEL TO POSSIBLY FALL OFF AND DEFINITE DESTRUCTION OF THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL! IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT YOU REPLACE THE BEARING WITH WHATS CALLED A REPAIRING WHICH IS WIDER AND HEAVIER DUTY THAN THE OEM BEARING THEREBY IT COVERS A WIDER PORTION OF THE AXLE AND DOES NOT SIT IN THE SPACE WHERE THE OEM BEARING WORE DOWN THE METAL.AFTER REPLACING IT A SECOND TIME IT LASTED ABOUT 3 YEARS 2011) AND THEN THE SEAL BLEW OUT ON THIS WHEEL WHICH IS THE SAME PROCEDURE AS REPLACING THE BEARING.

FORTUNATELY THERE WAS THE 2ND ENTRANCE TO A REST STOP ON US 63 IMMEDIATELY TO MY LEFT AND I PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT.  US 63 IS A 2 LANE HIGHWAY WITH AN OCCASIONAL PASSING LANE ON SOME HILLS.  IT WAS ALSO FORTUNATE IT HAPPENED AT THAT POINT OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS POSITION WITH LITTLE ROOM TO GET SAFELY OFF THE HIGHWAY WITH THE NARROW SHOULDERS AND ROCK CUTS RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE IN THE PARKING LOT.  IT WAS THEN I FOUND SOMETHING EXPLODING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE ENGINE.  I COULD SMELL A LOT OF GAS AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF IMMEDIATELY.  I CALLED AAA AND WAS CARRIED BACK TO JONESBORO ON A FLATBED ABOUT 3 HOURS LATER.  I WENT TO CAVENAUGH FORD THE NEXT MORNING AND THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS A SPARK PLUG BLOWN OUT OF THE #3 CYLINDER.  THE REPAIR WITH A FULL SET OF NEW PLUGS INSTALLED IN ADDITION TO THE BAD CYLINDER COST $629 PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $190 FOR TOWING.  ONE ADDITIONAL PLUG ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE ENGINE WAS ALSO LOOSE AND A POTENTIAL BLOWOUT.  THESE PLUGS WERE FACTORY ORIGINAL AND HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE PLUGS WERE NOT PROPERLY TORQUED IN AT THE FACTORY WHICH RESULTS IN LOOSENING OF THE THREADS IN THE HEAD OVER TIME FROM THE PERCUSSION IN EACH CYLINDER.

I HAD PREVIOUSLY DISENGAGED THE OVERDRIVE AND MANUALLY SHIFTED INTO 2ND GEAR AT 20-25 MPH FOR BETTER CONTROL. THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY OVER STEERED TO THE RIGHT.  TRYING TO CORRECT, IT OVER STEERED TO THE LEFT, SLID SIDEWAYS IN THE DEEP SHOULDER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR ABOUT 25 FEET.  THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL HIT A LARGE OAK TREE, BOUNCED OFF AND THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN A STEEP 70 FOOT DRIVEWAY AND JUMPED A FROZEN PILE OF SNOW.  I DID HAVE THE CAR UNDER CONTROL GOING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.  IT WAS A VERY BUSY TEN SECONDS.   THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FROM GEICO IS $5100, CLAIM 023442150101027.  I CALL THE FORD 800 NUMBER AND DIDN'T GET ANY HELP THERE, WHICH IS NO SURPRISE.  I AM WELL AWARE OF MANUFACTURERS NOT ADDRESSING VEHICLE PROBLEMS UNTIL THEY HAVE TO BECAUSE OF MONETARY ISSUES OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.  I AM A FORMER GM DEALER AND HAVE DRIVEN LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES IN VARIOUS CONDITIONS OF DIRE REPAIR.  I ALSO ATTENDED BONDURANT HIGH SPEED DRIVING SCHOOL, HAVE AN EXPIRED SCCA RACING LICENSE AND HOLD AMA EXPERT COMPETITION MOTORCYCLE LICENSE. EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS 35 TO 40 YEARS AGO THE COMPETITION EXPERIENCE TOOK OVER.  ONE CAUSE COULD BE THE LOCKING DOG FOR THE STEERING HAS SHORTED THE CRUISE CONTROL RIBBON WIRES AND CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  THERE COULD ALSO BE ISSUES WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL CIRCUITRY AND/OR MODULES. SINCE THE ACCIDENT I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT CRUISE ENGAGEMENT PROBLEMS.  THERE ALSO MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH THE AUTO TRACTION CONTROL WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE CAR WENT SO VIOLENTLY OUT OF CONTROL.  THIS DEVICE IS RATHER USELESS AND IMPEDES DRIVABILITY RATHER THAN HELPS.  ON THE DRIVE BACK TO MY HOUSE I HAD TO DISENGAGE IT TO DRIVE UP SMALL HILLS, AND HAVE DONE SO BEFORE IN BAD WEATHER AS THIS TYPE OF TRACTION CONTROL IMPEDES ACCELERATION.  *JB",

WHEN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS HAD COLLECTED IN THE FLUID THEY ACTED LIKE A CHECK-VALVE, ALLOWING FLUID INTO THE CALIPERS TO ACTUATE THE BRAKES BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE FLUID TO RETURN AND THE BRAKES COULD NOT RELEASE.  THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF REPLACING BOTH FRONT BRAKE LINES AND BOTH CALIPER UNITS, COSTING OVER $600.    ONLY MOMENTS BEFORE THE BRAKES LOCKED MY CAR HAD BEEN AT SPEEDS OF 55 - 65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY.
