Computer system that controls turn signals, headlights, highbeams, windows, door locks etc. Yes it is available for inspection.   How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk?  I can't use my turn signals, highbeams, headlights, Windows. I can't signal my cars lane changes or see clearly at night. I can't roll the windows down or up which creates a unsafe hazard. My child is able to climb out of the window in the back seat while I'm driving. I have zero control over the windows. I can't determine if my child's door is open or closed when the car is in motion. My car doors no longer lock at all. My child can open up the door at any moment that the car is in motion.  I'm unable to see at night without my highbeams. I'm now forced to drive with reduced visibility.   Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center?  Both by a dealership and independent shop. There have been reconcurring warrantee coverages offered but no recalls despite the clear determinant to safety. Common usage of the vehicle at this point in time is a safety concern of all surrounding users and transportation vehicles.   Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others?  The manufacturer has inspected this module concern. I'm very sure that there have been accidents associated with this module malfunction.   Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  There are zero signs of this issue prior to it's failure.

This module distributes power to many components and since it has failed I have no headlights, no turn signals, no interior lights, no dashboard lights, and cannot roll my windows up or down. This is a known flaw with these cars and if you look on eBay there are bootleg repair services than can temporarily reset it however they often fail again. There are dozens of these sellers on Ebay and all list +1000 sales for their repair services so clearly this is widespread and affects many BMW owners. BMW denies there is an issue but has placed a 10 year warranty on the part, however all 3 series affected by this part are over 10 years old and not eligible for this warranty.       Digging around on BMW forums this seems extremely common and almost anything can cause the FRM to fail. Headlights burning out, weak batteries, replacing interior dome lights, and even BMW connecting to the OBDII port to read the ecu are common causes of the FRM failing. I don't understand how they can get away with putting a limited warranty on this and not a full recall when it's clearly a safety concern as I can't safely or legally drive my car with no working lights, and in the event of an emergency cannot roll down my windows to get out of the car.",

The loose connection at the battery terminal on this wire caused the car to suddenly turn off while driving on the road. Once turned off, there was zero electrical response from the car (e.g. engine turned off, no headlights, no hazard lights, no power steering, no capability to restart the car, airbags likely would not deploy if car crashed, etc.). The car could only be controlled by coasting on its remaining inertia, slowed down using residual braking power (which disappears after applying the breaks 2-5 times due to loss of hydraulic pressure), and forcefully steering the car (since there\u2019s no power steering). This is an INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS situation that could cause loss of life due to complete loss of control of car.  Both the battery and alternator were in good health. Only the battery terminal connection was loose, leading to a single point failure of the ENTIRE electrical system of the car and the car itself. There is NO redundancy in the electrical system; even if the alternator is running fine, the loose battery connection will kill the car.  Furthermore, once car is stopped and safely secured, it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to open the trunk to access the battery as there is no way to access the trunk manually via key. I had to apply a 12V source to the large red wire at the fuse box to power on the car, enabling me to open the trunk. This requires removing cupholders, glove box, various trim panels, etc. to access the fuse box. Absolutely terrible design.",

My driver side window and windshield were both broken from the explosion of the airbags but the body of my car wasn't damaged. I had noticed that sometimes the display in my car wouldnt show all the car controls but never imagined the car would malfunction like this.

ACCORDING TO CERTIFIED BMW MECHANIC, THIS BOLT WOULD ONLY BE MANIPULATED DURING FACTORY PRODUCTION.     I WAS ABLE TO CATCH THE PROBLEM BEFORE THE OIL DRAINED COMPLETED OUT OF MY VEHICLE OR BEFORE THE ENGINE CAUGHT FIRE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE BAY BECAUSE OF OIL SPRAYING. I AM CONCERNED THAT A MAJOR ENGINE COMPONENT ON MY VEHICLE FAILED. THIS FAILURE POSES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY AND QUALITY ISSUE. THIS IS A PART INTEGRITY/QUALITY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY BMW IMMEDIATELY.",

I LEARNED IT WAS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND CONTACTED BMW DEALER IN EARLY 2018 WHEN THE CAR HAD 88254 MILES AND THEY SAID IT WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND WOULD COST ABOUT $1300 TO FIX THE AIRBAG SENSOR MAT. I FOUND A REPAIR PLACE TO REPLACE THE OC3 PASSENGER SEAT MAT WITH BMW PART FOR ALMOST $900.  I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM UNTIL AUGUST 2018 I RECEIVED A NOTICE FOR THE EXACT SAME PART FOR OUR OTHER CAR, A 2004 X3 WHICH GAVE A WARRANTY EXTENSION AND OFFERED REIMBURSEMENT IF THE PART HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED. I CONTACTED BMW AND THEY REFUSED TO OFFER SAME EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR AIRBAG SENSOR MATTS IN MY 2011 328I. SINCE MY CAR EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS AS THOSE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY EXTENSION AND, I HAVE FOUND ONLINE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MANY BMWS, THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE IS A FLAW WITH THE SENSOR ITSELF NOT SPECIFIC TO THE X3 MODEL. IN FACT THE SENSOR HAS NOT YET  FAILED IN OUR 2004 X3 THAT HAS OVER 160,000 MILES.  THE 2011 328 SENSOR  HAD THE SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS WITH A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.  I'VE OWNED MANY VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME FEATURE AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS. AT THE VERY LEAST A NEW INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR ALL BMW MODELS. I DROVE FOR OVER A YEAR WITH THIS PROBLEM UNTIL I REALIZED IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THE AIRBAGS MIGHT NOT WORK IF THE SENSOR WAS BROKEN. IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX.

I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE RECALL LISTED THE REPAIR WAS TO TAKE 4 HOURS BUT THEY HAD MY CAR 3 DAYS. NO LOANER WAS GIVEN UNTIL THE END OF THE 2ND DAY. THEY ARE NOW REFUSING TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE VALVE COVER $1000 REPAIR. I NOTICED ONLINE THAT SEVERAL DEALERS REPLACED THE VALVE COVER AS A PART OF THIS SERVICE TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM, THOUGH BERT SMITH BMW ST. PETERSBURG, FL DID NOT. I ALSO HAVE 2 OTHER OPEN RECALLS ON MY CAR THAT HAVE BEEN LISTED AS A REMEDY NOT AVAILABLE SINCE DECEMBER 2017.",

A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T SEE IT FAIR THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR AN ENGINE PROBLEM THAT BMW HAS HAD KNOWINGLY SINCE THE BEGINNING (2007) AND NEVER RESOLVED ON LATER MODELS. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE COVERED BY A RECALL AS IT IS DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO BE DRIVING THE CAR WITH CHANCES OF THE ENGINE STUMBLING AT HIGH SPEEDS. THE ORIGINAL CAMSHAFT BEARING LEDGE IS SAID TO HAVE METAL RINGS THAT RUBS AGAINST METAL AND WEARS OFF QUICKLY, THE REPLACEMENT IS A RUBBER ONE THAT LASTS LONGER AND SHOULD NOT BRING ANYMORE ISSUES TO THE CAR. THE CAR ONLY HAS 62K MILES ON IT AND THE OIL HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHANGED EVERY 5K MILES, WHICH IS 10K MILES LESS THAN BMW RECOMMENDS.

IT ALMOST TOTALED THE OTHER CAR AND MY CAR WAS VERY BADLY DAMAGED. INITIAL ESTIMATE TO REPAIR IS AROUND $7,911 BY THE BMW AUTHORIZED BODY SHOP. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER NEXT DAY ASKING THEM TO CHECK IF  MY CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE CAR HAS TO BE INSPECTED BY THE BMW ENGINEER, AND THE DEALER CAN'T TOUCH THE CAR BECAUSE OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION ISSUE. I CALLED THE BMW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP DEPT. RIGHT AWAY, AND THEY SCHEDULED AN ENGINEER  TO COME AND LOOK AT MY CAR. ONE WEEK LATER, A BMW ENGINEER CAME TO THE BODY SHOP AND DOWNLOADED THE DATA, AND  TODAY I WAS NOTIFIED BY BMW THAT THE CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM A LOCAL BMW DEALER AS CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED VEHICLE LAST YEAR WITH ABOUT 23K MILES ON IT AND STILL HAS THE WARRANTY.I AM WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE MY FAMILY DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR. I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON BIMMERFEST AND ONE ON YOUR SITE FOR THE 2011 BMW 328I, REGARDING THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION. I ASKED THEM BMW TO REPLACE THE CAR, WHICH THEY WOULDN'T DO. I REQUESTED BMW TO SEND A LETTER STATING THAT THE CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE ALONG WITH A REPORT ABOUT THEIR FINDINGS, SINCE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPLACE MY CAR. NOT SURE IF THEY WILL SEND ME ONE.AS A GOOD CITIZEN WITH GOOD DRIVING RECORD, I AM REALLY SCARED ABOUT DRIVING THIS CAR WHICH IN MY OPINION IS NOT SAFE.  I AM HOPING THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER CAREFULLY, AND GET A BETTER RESOLUTION TO MY ISSUE.   THANK YOU.  *TR",

THE COLLISION WAS MY FAULT, AND I WAS HIT DIRECTLY IN THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR OF MY 2011 BMW 328I CONVERTIBLE.  THERE WAS NO SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT, NO CALL TO BMW SOS, NO ENGINE TURN OFF, AND NO FLASHER WORKING.  THE CAR WAS TOTALED AND I AM EXTREMELY BLESSED TO HAVE NO MORE SERIOUS INJURIES.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM BMW SPECIAL PRODUCT INVESTIGATION... WHO INITIATED THE CALL TO ME... SINCE LAST THURSDAY.   I HAVE CALLED THE MAN WHO IS WITH THAT DEPARTMENT IN NJ ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND HE HAS NOT RETURNED MY CALLS. (HE DID CALL ON LAST FRIDAY TO SAY THAT A MAN FROM ATLANTA HAD INSPECTED THE CAR ON THURSDAY.  NO CONTACT WITH HIM SINCE THAT DAY)   I HAVE BRUISED RIBS AND MUSCLES ON THE LEFT AND AM TO HAVE A CT SCAN FOR A POSSIBLE HEMATOMA BEHIND LEFT BREAST.  I ONLY WANT A REASON AS TO WHY THE SIDE AIRBAG, CALL TO BMW, ENGINE TURN OFF, AND FLASHERS DID NOT WORK. I PAID OVER $56,000 FOR THE CAR LESS THAN A MONTH EARLIER, AND THE CAR HAD LESS THAN 400 MILES ON IT.  *LN",
