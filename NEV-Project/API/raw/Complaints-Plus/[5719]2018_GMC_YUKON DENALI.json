JEEP COMMANDER WAS PROPELLED INTO 2015 NISSAN XTERRA, ALSO STOPPED IN TRAFFIC. NONE OF THE AIRBAGS IN MY 2018 GMC YUKON DENALI DEPLOYED EITHER IN THE REAR END IMPACT, NOR THE FRONT IMPACT OF MY VEHICLE HITTING THE JEEP COMMANDER. ACCIDENT WAS ON SUNDAY, 04-21-2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 01:30 PM MST. SKIES WERE PARTLY SUNNY AND ROAD HAD MINIMAL WET AREA FROM EARLIER SUN SHOWER. AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED IN BOTH COLLISIONS, YET DID NOT. I AM EXTREMELY AGITATED ABOUT MY AIRBAGS NOT DEPLOYING",
