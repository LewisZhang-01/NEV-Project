SIMILAR SUSPENSION RECALLS OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS FOR ELANTRA, SONATA, TIBURON, AZERA AND OTHER MODELS.]  IN MARCH 2010, RESPONDING TO RECALL, VEHICLE TAKEN TO AUTHORIZED HYUNDAI DEALER, WHERE DEALER ELECTED TO REPAIR, RATHER THAN REPLACE AFFECTED FRONT AND REAR SUSPENSION COMPONENTS. THE PRESCRIBED RECALL REPAIR CONSISTED OF DRILLING (DRAIN) HOLES IN ALL FRONT & REAR SUSPENSION COMPONENTS, REMOVING EXCESS RUST FROM INSIDE COMPONENTS, THEN SPRAYING WITH ANTI-CORROSIVE WAX. AUGUST 7, 2013, RIGHT REAR TRAILING ARM FAILED DUE TO CONTINUED EXCESSIVE CORROSION, CAUSING STEERING LOSS AND NEAR WHEEL COLLAPSE. HYUNDAI DEALER REVEALED CAUSE OF SUSPENSION FAILURE. HYUNDAI CORROSION SPECIALIST CONCLUDED THAT HYUNDAI WOULD REPLACE BOTH REAR TRAILING ARMS ONLY (NOT FRONT SUB-FRAME COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXCESSIVELY RUSTED/CORRODED), BUT THAT BECAUSE OF VEHICLE'S 10+ YEAR AGE, OWNER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL \"INCIDENTAL AND RELATED SUSPENSION PARTS AND LABOR\" EXPENSES INCURRED WHILE THE REAR TRAILING ARM REPLACEMENTS WERE BEING MADE.  I AM APPEALING THIS HYUNDAI DECISION TO NHTSA BECAUSE THE REPAIR THAT HYUNDAI ELECTED TO PERFORM (VS A FULL COMPONENTS REPLACEMENT) IN MARCH 2010, WHEN VEHICLE WAS ONLY 9 YEARS OLD, HAS PROVEN TO BE TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE, AND THAT OWNER HAS NOT CONTRIBUTED, IN ANY WAY, TO THIS SUSPENSION DEFECT.  GIVEN HYUNDAI'S  CORROSION VULNERABILITIES, THEIR INABILITY TO EFFECT A REPAIR IN 2010, AND THE OWNER'S NON-CONTRIBUTORY ROLE HERE, HYUNDAI SHOULD NOW REPLACE ALL FRONT & REAR SUSPENSION COMPONENTS, AS THEY SHOULD HAVE IN 2010, AT NO COST TO THE OWNER.  *TR",

LATER THAT NIGHT I DID SOME RESEARCH AND SAW THAT THEY HAD A RECALL FOR THE 2001 HYUNDAI SANTA FE BECAUSE OF THE TRAILING ARMS RUSTING OUT. I CALLED THE CORPORATION FOR HYUNDAI REFERENCE MY SITUATION AND ASKED ABOUT THE RECALL. THEY SAID THAT SINCE I DID NOT LIVE IN A SALT BELT STATE, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME. I THEN CALLED MY LOCAL HYUNDAI AND ASKED THEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD BRING IT IN AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO, BUT THEY WOULD NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES. OUR LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP HAS A HORRIBLE REPUTATION, AND I KNEW IF I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THEM, NOT ONLY WOULD THEY TELL ME THAT THE VEHICLE DID NOT FALL UNDER THE RECALL, THEY WOULD CHARGE ME AND ARM AND LEG TO FIX IT. I CHOSE TO STAY WITH MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO I TRUST. THAT MECHANIC TOLD ME THE ARM WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED OUT. . HE HAD PULLED UP THE RECALL AS WELL, AND AGREED WITH ME THAT HYUNDAI SHOULD FIX THIS FREE OF CHARGE, SINCE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DEFECT ON THEIR PART. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SALT BELT STATE RULE FOR THE RECALL MADE NO SENSE SINCE OTHER THINGS CAN CAUSE RUST. AFTER MY VEHICLE WAS FIXED I TOOK THE TRAILING ARM TO MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND SHOWED THEM. I TOLD THEM I EXPECTED THEM TO PAY AT LEAST FOR THE ARM WHICH COST ME 189.00 PLUS TAX, SINCE THIS WAS THEIR DEFECT. I HAD ALSO BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM THEM ON APRIL 30. THEY SAID NO AND SHOWED ME THE DOOR. MY SON COULD HAVE CRASHED AND DIED. HYUNDAI SHOULD BE ASHAMED.",

MY VEHICLE BEGAN TO SWERVE AS IF ON A SHEET OF ICE.  ROAD CONDITIONS WERE ACTUALLY OPTIMAL WITH NO WATER, ICE OR OTHER ADVERSE ROAD CONDITIONS.  I WAS ABLE TO WRESTLE MY VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY ONTO AN EXIT WHILE GENTLY APPLYING MY BRAKES TO GRADUALLY REDUCE SPEED.  THE VEHICLE WAS CANTED ON THE ROADWAY (REAR END SIGNIFICANTLY DISPLACED TO RIGHT) AS I DROVE IT TO A NEARBY REPAIR SHOP.  I WAS BASICALLY DRAGGING THE REAR END BEHIND ME.  A FRIEND CONFIRMED THIS APPEARANCE AND THAT THE PASSENGER-SIDE REAR TIRE WAS ALSO DEVIATED TOWARD THE RIGHT AND THAT BOTH TIRES WERE ANGLED INWARD AS HE FOLLOWED ME TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  AT THIS TIME, I WAS UNAWARE OF A SAFETY RECALL (NHTSA ACTION # EA08023, RECALL CAMPAIGN # 09V123000) THAT APPLIED TO MY VEHICLE.  THE REAR TRAILING ARMS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CORROSION AND FAILURE.  UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY OWNERS WHO HAD PURCHASED THAT VEHICLE IN A SALT-BELT STATE, OR WERE REGISTERED IN A SALT-BELT STATE AT THE TIME OF THE RECALL (APRIL 2009) WERE NOTIFIED OF THE DANGER.  MY VEHICLE HAD BEEN PURCHASED IN OREGON AND I HAVE RESIDED IN OKLAHOMA FOR THE 4 YEARS.  I DID SPEND 4 YEARS DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IN 2 SALT-BELT STATES, HOWEVER, EXPOSED TO THE CONDITIONS THAT ACCELERATED THE CORROSION OF THE FLAWED PARTS.  AFTER I DISCOVERED THIS RECALL ON MY OWN ON 7/8/2010, I GOT THE VEHICLE TOWED TO EDMOND HYUNDAI IN EDMOND, OK AND BEGAN TRYING TO GET THIS RECALL WORK DONE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AGREED THAT BOTH REAR TRAILING ARMS HAD FAILED AND HAD SIGNIFICANT CORROSION.  HYUNDAI AGREED TO REPLACE THE REAR TRAILING ARMS, BUT HAS REFUSED TO PAY FOR TOWING AND OTHER VEHICLE DAMAGES THAT RESULTED FROM THIS COMPONENT FAILURE.  THEY ALSO REFUSED TO PROVIDE A VEHICLE WHILE MINE IS IN THE SHOP OR PAY FOR A COMPARABLE RENTAL VEHICLE.  I HAVE ESCALATED THIS TO HYUNDAI'S NATIONAL OFFICE. *TR",

IT SEEMED TO RESPOND AND HANDLE SMOOTHLY BUT AS I EASED ON THE BRAKE TO SLOW FOR A RAILROAD CROSSING, THE TOE OF MY WORK BOOT BECAME WEDGED BETWEEN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE ACCELERATOR. THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LAUNCHED LIKE A ROCKET AND MY IMPULSE WAS TO PRESS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH MY FREE (LEFT) FOOT.

I SWITCHED THE IGNITION OFF LOSING ALL POWER STEERING AND BRAKING CAPABILITIES BUT WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP WITHOUT INCIDENT.

THE STEERING WHEEL JERKED TO THE RIGHT A QUARTER OF A TURN, AND THE VEHICLE ALMOST FLIPPED OVER. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED.    MY MECHANIC INFORMS ME THAT THIS COMPONENT SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. IN MY CASE, IT IS COMPLETELY CORRODED TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND CAUSED A STRUCTURAL FAILURE. I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS, AND HAVE NEVER SEEN A WEIGHT BEARING SUSPENSION COMPONENT FAIL UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.     HAD THIS FAILURE HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY, I AM SURE THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL WOULD HAVE COMPLETED DEPARTED THE VEHICLE RESULTING IN A COMPLETE LACK OF CONTROL AND PROBABLE DISASTER. WE CONSIDER OURSELVES VERY FORTUNATE THAT NO ONE WAS HURT.    HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR WAS EXPENSIVE. THE COST OF THE REPAIR WAS NEARLY $1,000. THE COST OF THE SUSPENSION COMPONENT ALONE WAS $567.79. I CONSIDER THIS FAILURE NOT A NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO INSPECT THE PART AND VEHICLE FOR COMPLETE ANALYSIS. I HAVE THE OLD PART AS WELL AS DIGITAL PHOTOS OF THE FAILED COMPONENT FOR YOUR REVIEW AS WELL AS REPAIR DOCUMENTATION.    I WOULD LIKE HYUNDAI TO COVER THE COST OF THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR.

I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI MANY TIMES SEEKING SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION TO MY COMPLAINT ON MY 2001 SANTA FE. THE SANTA FE WAS SOLD TO ME ADVERTISING 181 HORSEPOWER. THIS HOWEVER, IS NOT TRUE, AND I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM THEM.  I HAVE OFFERED HYUNDAI MANY SOLUTIONS THAT I CONSIDER SATISFACTORY TO MYSELF, AND AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.  I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY HYUNDAI IS HANDLING THE VALID COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WHO, IN GOOD FAITH, PURCHASED A VEHICLE THAT IS NOT WHAT IT WAS ADVERTISED TO BE. I AM VERY UPSET WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MATTER IS BEING IGNORED.   HYUNDAI DID HOWEVER, SET THEIR OWN DEADLINE OF SEPT 2003 FOR CLOSURE TO ALL AFFECTED BY THIS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. THIS LEADS ME TO WONDER IF THEY ARE PURPOSELY DRAGGING THEIR FEET TO FORCE OWNERS OF THESE AFFECTED VEHICLES IN TO RESOLUTION THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTABLE.   THE VEHICLE IS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR AND THE LACK OF CONCERN FROM HYUNDAI IS VERY UNSETTLING TO ME. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST 10 PERCENT LESS HP THAN ADVERTISED. THE AFFECT IT COULD HAVE ON THE SAFETY AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE IS SCARY. THE VEHICLE HAS A CERTAIN TOWING CAPACITY AND TORQUE. THIS ALSO HAS TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS.
