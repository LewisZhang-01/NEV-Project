THIS NEW MODULE HAS THE SAME EXACT CONSTRUCTION AS THE ORIGINAL PART.

THE END SECTIONS WILL BE DESTROYED IN EVEN A LOW SPEED IMPACT.  THE KILLER IS THE DAMAGE TO THE SIDE BED PANELS.    BECAUSE THE REAR OF PANEL IS A SINGLE WALL OF SHEET METAL, UN REINFORCED, IT BUCKLES LIKE FABRIC AT EVEN THE LIGHTEST TOUCH.  YOU COULD BEND IT IN BY HAND IF YOU PUSH HARD ENOUGH.    SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO PULL OUT THIS PANEL DUE TO ITS UN REINFORCED SHEET METAL DESIGN, THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE REPAIR IS TO REPLACE THE WHOLE PANEL.      THEY SELL THE TRUCK CHEAP!  THEY MAKE A FORTUNE ON REPLACEMENT PARTS BECAUSE OF THE CHEAP DESIGN QUALITY.      WORD TO THE WISE:  GET THE REAR BACKING SENSORS!  IT WILL SAVE YOU $3000.
