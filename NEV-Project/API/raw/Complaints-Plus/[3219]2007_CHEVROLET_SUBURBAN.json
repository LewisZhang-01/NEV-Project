FURTHER EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM IS THAT GM AND ITS DEALERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO FIX THE ISSUE AS A FULL ENGINE REPLACEMENT IS WHAT IS BEING OFFERED AS A SOLUTION.  I WAS QUOTED BY MY DEALER THAT THE COSTS FOR THIS IS (~)$8,000.00!  AS IS THE CASE WITH THE OTHERS THAT HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS: I WAS DRIVING ALONG AND THE OIL PRESSURE WENT TO ZERO.  AFTER TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY REPLACED A FEW COMPONENTS AND SENT ME ON MY WAY (AFTER GETTING A LARGE BILL OF COURSE).  WE USE THE CAR VERY INFREQUENTLY AND AS SUCH, WITHIN A 100 MILES OF USE, I WAS BACK AT THE DEALER WITH, AGAIN, VERY LOW OIL PRESSURE.  THERE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AT $8000 OR PERFORM AN OVERHAUL AT 2000+ WITH NO GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  FROM A COST STANDPOINT: THE SUBURBAN IS A $60,000+ VEHICLE, AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT FIXABLE/RESOLVABLE, OTHER THAN BY GM ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL $8000.  FROM A SAFETY ISSUE, THESE CARS ARE HEAVY, BIG, AND CAN CAUSE MUCH DAMAGE IF THE DRIVER IS DISTRACTED BY SUCH A LARGE ENGINE PROBLEM AND/OR THE ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN DUE TO THE ENGINE BLOCK FREEZING UP AND/OR SEIZING DUE TO THE LACK OF OIL PRESSURE.    NOW, AND ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF GMS REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY RECALL ASSOCIATED WITH ITS IGNITIONS, I THINK THERE IS SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR THE NHTSA TO TAKE A HARD LOOK INTO THIS, OPEN A FULL INVESTIGATION, AND HOPEFULLY RECTIFY THIS FOR THE HUNDRED (AND POSSIBLY THOUSANDS) OF CONSUMERS AFFECTED AND FORCE GM TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO ITS EXISTING/PAST SALES, AS WELL AS ADDRESS ITS FUTURE DESIGNS.   *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED A SENSOR THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE STEERING.  EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE NORMAL FOR ABOUT A MONTH, BUT THEN REAL PROBLEMS BEGAN TO HAPPEN.  THE FIRST ADVERSE OCCURRENCE HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING AT A STEADY SPEED, GOING STRAIGHT, AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH.  THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE ENGAGED HARSHLY TWO TIMES IN RAPID SUCCESSION, THEN THE SERVICE STABILITRAC AND SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHTS CAME ON.  I DID NOT TOUCH THE BRAKE AND WAS NOT ACCELERATING.  I TOOK IT TO A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND THEY HAD IT FOR THREE DAYS TRYING TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  THEY EVEN SENT IT HOME WITH A SHOP FOREMAN OVERNIGHT.  HOWEVER, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH EITHER OF THE SYSTEMS.  AS I WAS LEAVING THEIR LOT BOTH LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN, BUT WITHOUT THE HARSH BRAKING.  TWO DAYS LATER (TODAY) MY FAMILY AND I WERE BEGINNING TO ENTER AN ENTRANCE RAMP TO THE HIGHWAY (AGAIN AT ABOUT 25-30 MPH) AND THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE ENGAGED THREE TIMES IN RAPID SUCCESSION HARD ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TIRE SQUEAL EACH TIME.  A CAR WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME AND SKIDDED TO KEEP FROM RUNNING INTO THE REAR END OF THE SUBURBAN.  MY WIFE AND I AND FOUR CHILDREN WERE IN THE VEHICLE.  NOW I AM AFRAID TO EVEN DRIVE IT.  IF THIS HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THE VEHICLE WOULD PROBABLY OVERTURN.  I WILL BE CALLING THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE MORNING.  *TR",
