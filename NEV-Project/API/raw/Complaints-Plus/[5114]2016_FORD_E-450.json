IF THE HITCH IS USED IN THE STATED 8,000 POUND CAPACITY, THE HITCH WILL FAIL AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. FORD MOTOR COMPANY MAKES THE E450 CHASSIS THAT THE MOTOR HOME BODY IS MOUNTED ON. FORD STATES THAT THE TONGUE WEIGHT FOR A PROPERLY LOADED 8,000 POUND TRAILER SHOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF 800 TO 1,200 POUNDS (10% TO 15%). THOR MOTOR COACH HAS DE-RATED THE HITCH CAPACITY TO 500 POUNDS WHICH RESULTS IN A MAXIMUM SAFE HITCH  RATING OF 5,000 POUNDS. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF I AM TO HAVE A SAFE TOW WITH AN 8,000 POUND TRAILER, I WILL NEED A MINIMUM OF 800 POUNDS ON THE HITCH WHICH MAY LEAD TO A SUBSTANTIAL AND SERIOUS MECHANICAL FAILURE. THOR MOTOR COACH ADVERTISES THE HITCH AS 8,000 POUNDS WHICH MAY DIRECTLY LEAD TO UNSAFE TOWING. I AM CONCERNED THAT MANY MOTOR HOME OWNERS WILL RELY ON THE THOR MOTOR COACH STATEMENT FOR AN 8,000 POUND HITCH AND SERIOUSLY OVERLOAD THE SUPPLIED HITCH. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ABOUT 4,500 PEOPLE DIED IN TOWING RELATED ACCIDENTS BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012. I AM ATTACHING A PICTURE OF THE ACTUAL HITCH RATING PLATE. I RECOMMEND THAT THOR MOTOR COACH QUIT ADVERTISING THE HITCH AT 8,000 POUNDS DUE THE ACCIDENT PRONE TOWING CONDITION THIS CREATES.",
