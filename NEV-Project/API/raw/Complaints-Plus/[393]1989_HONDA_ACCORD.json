VIN NUMBER: [XXX] THE HYBRID HONDA HAS A DANGEROUS ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION DESIGN-FLAW VIBRATION.  AN ORIGINAL DESIGN CAUSES THE VIBRATION. WE REPLACED THE TIRES WITH NEW PERFECTLY BALANCED TIRES AND REPLACED THE BRAKE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS AND REPLACED THE SUGGESTED ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS. THE HONDA STILL HAS THE DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION VIBRATION.  AUTO-PARTS DEALERS DIFFER ON WHAT ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS TO USE. HONDA WILL NOT PROVIDE A FACTORY MANUAL ON HOW MANY OR WHERE ENGINE MOUNTS AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS THE HYBRID NEEDS. THE HYBRID DESIGN FLAW VIBRATION CAUSED ME TO SWERVE INTO THE OTHER LANE AND BARELY AVOID A HEAD-ON COLLISION. WHEN THE DRIVER APPLIES AN INITIAL LOAD AS SMALL AS ENGAGEMENT OF THE AIR CONDITIONING, THE STEERING WHEEL ACTUALLY JUMPS UP AND DOWN. THE DESIGN FLAW DANGEROUSLY VIBRATES THE WHOLE AUTOMOBILE.    WE REPLACED THE TIRES WITH PERFECTLY BALANCED TIRES, THE MOTOR MOUNTS AND THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTS, AND BRAKE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS.  BRAKING IS SMOOTH.  HONDA WILL NOT PROVIDE A FACTORY MANUAL TO DETERMINE WHERE OR HOW MANY PARTS TO USE.  CHILTON AND HAYES\u0019AUTO REPAIR MANUALS DO NOT HAVE THE HYBRID DETAIL.

I'VE TAKEN THE CAR TO SEVERAL REPAIR FACILITIES AND DESPITE MY SPENDING NEARLY $3,000 ON \"REPAIR-WORK\", THE PROBLEM CAUSED THE CAR'S DEMISE AT 116,000 MILES ON JUNE 11, 2003.  THE GEAR WOULD NOT ENGAGE DESPITE CLUTCH REPLACEMENTS  IN JAN OR FEB. 2003 AND  IN 1999. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED HOME.  I HAVE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, WITH REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY 3 TO 6 MONTHS HOPING TO KEEP IT TILL AN ODOMETER READING OF AT LEAST 160,000 MILES.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED WITHIN A YEAR OF OWNERSHIP AND I FELT THAT I HAD NO RECOURSE BUT TO TRY TO GET IT REPAIRED.  I DID NOT TAKE IT TO MY HONDA DEALER BECAUSE I FELT THAT THEIR CHARGES FOR OIL CHANGES WERE EXCESSIVE COMPARED TO REGULAR GAS STATIONS CHARGES AND TO MY MIND, DELIVERED INEFFECTUAL REPAIRS AND SUSPECT SUGGESTIONS FOR REPAIR AS WAS THE PRACTICE IN OTHER DEALERSHIPS IN THE EARLY 90'S.   MY HONDA EXPERIENCE WAS NOT A GOOD ONE AND HAS COST ME HALF THE PRICE OF THE CAR IN REPAIRS.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEEK ANY REDRESS FOR ME SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR SO LONG AGO BUT I THINK I'VE BEEN DEALT A BAD DEAL.  THINKING BACK ON IT ALL, I BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A LEMON.
