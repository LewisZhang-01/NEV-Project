I PULLED OVER AND SHUT THE CAR OFF, THEN AFTER A MINUTE RESTARTED. IT STARTED OK, I THEN USED AN ODB ADAPTER TO READ THE CODES, AND FOUND A SOFT (NOT PERMANENT) CODE P2112 (THROTTLE BODY STUCK CLOSED). I IMMEDIATELY CALL THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT. WHEN THEY GOT THE CAR, THE CODE WAS NO LONGER IN THE COMPUTER. THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC, DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING, CHARGED ME $200, AND SENT ME HOME.    SECOND OCCURRENCE WAS ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO, AGAIN DRIVING HOME FROM WORK, THEN WHILE COMING UP TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT THE SAME FAILURE HAPPENED AGAIN. AFTER RESTARTING, AND DRIVING HOME, I BEGAN RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM.    TODAY, WHILE RETURNING HOME IN THE RAIN DURING A 5 MILE DRIVE IT FAILED 5 TIMES, EACH TIME I HAD TO PULL OVER, SHUT IT DOWN THEN RESTART. NOW I HAVE A PERMANENT CODE STORED IN THE COMPUTER (P2112) AND AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP TO FIX IT.     I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THE THROTTLE BODY WILL BE REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP, BUT I AM OUT OF WARRANTY NOW, AND THEY WILL INDEED CHARGE ME.    I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND BELIEVE FORD SHOULD PROVIDE AN UPDATED PART THAT WILL RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. I SUSPECT THAT THIS WILL IN TIME CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, PERHAPS EVEN INJURY FOR SOMEONE. THIS IS DUE TO AUTO MANUFACTURERS REMOVING THE RATHER SIMPLE MECHANICAL LINKAGE FROM PEDAL TO THROTTLE AND TURNING THIS OVER TO A COMPUTER. TO BE SURE, IT IS THE COMPUTER THAT IS CREATING THE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES BY DISENGAGING ALL THROTTLE CONTROL WHEN THE THROTTLE BODY IS STICKING, FORCING THE DRIVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD (ASSUMING THERE IS A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER).",

I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER THE DAY AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR, SPRING 2016, AND THEY MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS.

THE CAR HAS BEEN BACK AT THE DEALER FOR OVER A WEEK, THEY HAVE TRIED REPLACING THE HEADLIGHTS BUT I FEAR IT IS A DESIGN FLAW.  I PICKED UP THE CAR THIS EVENING AND WHEN I STARTED DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD I HAD TO DOUBLE CHECK TO CONFIRM THE HEADLIGHTS WERE ON.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER, THE GENERAL MANAGER ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE HEADLIGHTS LOOKED LIKE A PROBLEM.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED NEW SO I WOULD EXPECTED IT NOT TO HAVE THESE ISSUES.
