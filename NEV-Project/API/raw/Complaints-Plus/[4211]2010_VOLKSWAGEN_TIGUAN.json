        "summary": "The fusebox that was included in the NHTSA recall #13V569000  for lighting defects was never resolved correctly on this car and many other VW Tiquans like this.  I am a 45 year ASE licensed professional automotive technician.  I am an ASE Master tech with current L1-L9 licensing.  I am also an ex GM mastertech as well.  Part time automotive instructor too.  I've seen the multiple cases filed with the NHTSA regarding this melting fuse box that causes multiple issues whether they be with lighting, causes the engine & whole electrical system to shut down, same with several computers.  I've scanned the system using VAG-COM and have two different sets of scan data to show clearly the issue.  The car will load a multitude of erroneous codes because the central electrical, ABS, engine computer & other modules lose power causing a VERY dangerous situation for the operator of the vehicle.  Not to mention a fire danger.  I have pictures of the before and after repair I did on this vehicle.  It still needs the fuse box replaced.  I replaced the melted #6 wire that attaches to the fuse box (VW part# 1K0 937 125D) which was included in the original NHTSA recall I mentioned at the beginning of this essay.  The vehicle & component is available for inspection at any time.  This vehicle stalled & left my wife & kids stranded several times making it incredibly unsafe to drive. The car has been ok now for 2 weeks after my temporary repair.  Prior NHTSA complaints from other owners with similar issues were 10551509, 10552308, 10553122, 10553811, & 10776567.",

I GOOGLED THE RECALL, AND THEN MADE AN APPOINTMENT REGARDING THIS ISSUE, TAKING MY CAR IN ON MAY 5, 2014 AT HALLMARK VOLKSWAGON, BAKERS BRIDGE RD IN FRANKLIN, TN.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, ACCORDING TO MY PAPERWORK, STATES THEY \"REPLACED TRANSFER PUMP IN TANK ON DRIVER SIDE THEN TEST DROVE.  FOUND FUEL PRESSURE STILL LOW.  REPLACED IN TANK FUEL PUMP (PASSENGER SIDE) THEN RECHECKED.  FUEL PRESSURES OK AND NO LONGER STALLS.\"  SINCE THAT SERVICE DATE, MY TIGUAN HAS BEEN BACK TO BE SERVICED SEVERAL TIMES, FOR CONTINUED STALLING ISSUES, AND TO DATE, HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.  THE STALLING NOW OCCURS AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND MORE FREQUENTLY.  THE \"SAFETY ISSUE\" REGARDING THE STALLING IS A SERIOUS ONE, IN THAT WHEN MY TIGUAN BEGINS STALLING OUT, MY FOOT IS ON THE GAS PEDAL AND NOT THE BRAKE, RESULTING IN THE DRIVER BEHIND ME NOT KNOWING THAT I AM EITHER SLOWING DOWN OR COMING TO A STOP.  I HAVE COME VERY CLOSE TO BEING REAR-ENDED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS DUE TO THIS ISSUE, AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME, BEFORE I DO GET REAR-ENDED, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT BEING ON A HIGHWAY BY A SEMI TRUCK IS VERY GOOD, AS I DRIVE TO CINCINNATI OFTEN TO SEE MY CARDIOLOGIST FOR HEART ISSUES.  I LEAVE AGAIN IN 2 DAYS FOR HEART SURGERY IN CINCINNATI...I HAVE 3 THINGS TO FEAR: 1) GETTING THERE SAFELY  2) SURVIVING HEART SURGERY  3) GETTING BACK SAFELY ...THE STRESS OF DRIVING A CAR THAT MAY, OR MAY NOT, STALL OUT, IS NOT GOOD FOR MY HEART!",

I SEARCHED ON THE WEB AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED  2009-2011 VW TIGUANS OWNERS THAT HAD THAT SAME PROBLEM, I GOT AN ESTIMATE TO FIX IT OF $2,045. I CALLED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WHERE VERY NICE AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP ME WITH THE REPAIR. NEXT DAY I GET A CALL FROM THEM AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE MY TIGUAN HAD MORE THAN 70,000 MILES AND WAY OUT OF WARRANTY.

OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THIS SAME EXPERIENCE AND ONLY HAD THEIR TIGUAN FOR 2 MONTHS WITH 1,800 MILES ON AND THE PROBLEM KEEPS RECURRING!

BOTH ISSUES STEM FROM DESIGN AND NOT WEAR AND TEAR.  BOTH REPAIRS WERE COSTLY - $561 AND $753. I HAVE RECEIVED A SAFETY RECALL 97Z9 FROM VW FOR A FUSE ISSUE AND WILL BE WAITING ON A RESPONSE.  I'VE ALSO SUBMITTED AN INQUIRY TO VW ASKING ABOUT PLANS TO REVIEW THE DRAIN HOSE ISSUE.  HAD I NOT INVESTIGATED THE STRONG DAMP SMELL IN THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE I WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND THE SATURATED FLOORBOARD AND I DO MEAN SOAKING WET.  BOTH DRAIN HOSES WERE FOUND TO HAVE SMALL LEAKS AND THE ROUTE OF THE HOSES DUMPS RIGHT INTO THE CABIN - AGAIN THIS IS NOT A WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE - IT'S A DESIGN/PRODUCT ISSUE.  AS A PRECAUTION THE DEALER RECOMMENDED THAT I HAVE ALL OF THE HOSES REPLACED TO PREVENT FUTURE WATER DAMAGE.  I'VE SEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER VW OWNERS ABOUT THE DRAIN HOSES BEING DEFECTIVE SO THIS APPEARS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE THAN JUST A FEW VEHICLES.  THANK YOU.   *TR",
