THE TIRE WAS LOW MILEAGE AND MAINTAINED PROPERLY. THERE WERE NO ROAD HAZARDS. THERE ARE 5 PASSENGERS WHO CAN ATTEST TO THESE FACTS. A LA STATE TROOPER WHO ARRIVED ON THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT (AND CHANGED THE TIRE HIMSELF- NICE MAN!) IDENTIFIED THE DAMAGE AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH FIRESTONE TIRE FAILURES. IN FACT, HE FIRST DEMANDED TO KNOW IF IT WAS A FIRESTONE TIRE. THE TIRE TREAD WAS PRESERVED IN ONE PIECE AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PUNCTURE OR CUT ANYWHERE ON IT. WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE INDEED THAT THIS DID NOT RESULT IN A SERIOUS CRASH AND/OR FATALITY.
