METAL IS VERY SLIPPERY WHEN WET AND OWNER SLIPPED ON STEP RESULTING IN SERIOUS BACK BRUISING (LUCKILY NOT BROKEN BACK).  THERE SHOULD BE SKID PROTECTION ON THIS METAL.  ALSO TOP AND MIDDLE STEP TREADS ARE 9 1/4\" AND BOTTOM STEP OF ONLY 7 1/4\" MEANS UNEQUAL TREADS WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.  ACCORDING TO HOUSE BUILDING CODES, THESE WOULD BE ILLEGAL TREAD WIDTHS.    NOTE THAT THE VEHICLE OF REGENCY LATER ON IN YOUR FORM IS NOT CORRECT....DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO INPUT THE SIGNATURE SERIES MODEL. *TR",
