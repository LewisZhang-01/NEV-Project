AAMCO STATED THE DAMAGE WAS INSIDE OF TRANSMISSION AND THEY WOULD NEED TO REMOVE AND TEAR DOWN TO SEE WHAT ISSUE IS, BUT MORE THAN LIKELY IT WAS A COMPLETE FAILURE. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR IN NOVEMBER AND LUCKILY BOUGHT AN AFTERMARKET WARRANTY THAT 'SHOULD' COVER EVERYTHING. ISSUE IS THE WARRANTY COMPANY WILL MORE THAN LIKELY JUST REPLACE IT WITH A USED TRANS THAT WILL FAIL IN A SHORT TIME AND I WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. THIS IS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW ON THE PART OF VOLVO AND THEY SHOULD OWN UP TO IT. THE ENGINE PRODUCES TOO MUCH POWER AND THE VEHICLE IS TOO HEAVY FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO TAKE IT.  THIS IS A T6 BTW, WITH THE 6 CYLINDER AND TWIN TURBO.  VOLVO SHOULD HAVE A RECALL ON THIS TRANSMISSION. I HAVE SCOURED THE WEB AND SEE THIS IS AN ONGOING FREQUENT ISSUE WITH THE XC90 AND VOLVO IS LOSING WHAT WERE ONCE LOYAL CUSTOMERS.

ALTHOUGH, MY SON WANTED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE, I STEERED HIM TOWARDS THE VOLVO. THINKING THAT SINCE A VEHICLE (ESPECIALLY A VOLVO) SHOULDN'T EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION PROBLEM WITH RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE, I CONTACTED VOLVO NORTH AMERICA AND TOLD THEM OF MY PLIGHT AND REQUESTED THAT THEY PAY FOR THE REPAIR OR AT LEAST PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE REPAIR AND THEY FLATLY DENIED MY REQUEST.

WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE SAME VOLVO DEALER WHO DID NORMAL MAINTENANCE AT FIRST, BUT THEN THINGS STARTED TO GO DOWNHILL FROM THERE.  WE HAD A \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT THAT WOULD NOT GO OFF AFTER NUMEROUS COMPUTER DOWNLOADS.  WE WERE TOLD THE COMPUTER HAD TO RESET ITSELF FOR THIS TO GO OFF.  IT IS STILL ON AS OF TODAY.  WE REPLACED BOTH TURBOS ON THIS MODEL IN JUNE OF '08 FOR OVER $6,000.00 AND ONLY 70,000 MILES.  THE CAR SAT AT THE DEALERS SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR OVER A MONTH AND THEY HAD TO BRING IN A VOLVO EXPERT FOR THIS REPAIR.  IN SEPT. OF THIS YEAR THEY ARE BOTH NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD ONLY GET 25,000 MILES FROM THIS REPAIR.  IF I HAD KNOWN THEN, I WOULD HAVE TRADED IT IMMEDIATELY.   ALSO IN '08 THE \"SERVICE TRANSMISSION URGENT\" LIGHT CAME ON.  THERE WAS CLUNKING AND GRINDING IN THE TRANSMISSION SO WE TOWED IT TO THE DEALER (AGAIN).  THE PROBLEM WAS A YAW SENSOR FAILURE WITH WAS REPLACED AT THE DEALER.  THIS IS WHERE I BELIEVE OUR NEW PROBLEM STARTED.  WE NOW HAVE THE LIGHT ON AGAIN.  IT SLIPS IN 1ST GEAR AND SOMETIMES GETS CAUGHT IN 3RD AND WON'T COME OUT.

IF YOU CAN'T HELP, PLEASE AT LEAST SEND ME AN EMAIL AND TELL ME SO.  THANKS.  2.  ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT STARTED IN JULY 2006 IS A KNOCKING NOISE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.  AFTER NUMEROUS TRIPS TO THE DEALER I WAS TOLD A NEW BOX  FOR THAT PARTICULAR ITEM AND IT WOULD COST $2800.00 TO REPAIR.  BUT THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  MY XC90 HAD A 4 YR OR 50,000 WARRANTY.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED IN JULY 2006 WITH 41800 MILES.  I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CAR IN 12/02 SO MY MATH SAYS THE WARRANTY EXPIRED 12/06 AND THAT MEANS IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY WHEN THIS WAS FIRST NOTICED.  I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE IN AT LEAST  EVERY 4 MONTHS FOR SERVICE AND EACH TIME COMPLAINED ABOUT IT.  ALSO I HAD IT IN AT LEAST 5 TIMES FROM JUNE THRU JULY 2007 WITH NO SATISFACTION.  NOW THEY DON'T EVEN ANSWER MY EMAILS OR RETURN MY PHONE CALLS.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE CONSUMER COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT OF VOLVO AND THEY HAVE NEVER ANSWERED ME.  I AM AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT TO DO.
