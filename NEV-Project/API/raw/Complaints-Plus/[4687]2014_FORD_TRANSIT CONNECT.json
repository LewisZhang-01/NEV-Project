New radio was > $600.00, required reconfiguration of dashboard.  \u00b7Lost many, not all functions, of SYNC System, & it goes to sleep after a few minutes. Backup camera doesn\u2019t work if SYNC system is asleep. Sometimes revived after pushing SYNC button on steering column. \u00b7Auto electrical mechanic said still a drain on electrical system, but not like before. Rebuilt alternator & refurbished the fuse box too. Said electrical drain was from information control module on dashboard. Said take vehicle to Ford, have them reprogram the module where display screen is located & the drain occurring while vehicle is parked, would stop. \u00b7Ford Technician said they had \u201cno updates\u201d on information control module. Took care of recall & transmission issues, returned the vehicle. oParasitic drain & dead battery continued. 3-2022: \u00b7Battery tests as good but dies in 2 days.

AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF THE MECHANISM IN THE SEATBACK THAT CONTROLS THE SEAT FOLDING FUNCTION, AND THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN FIX IT IS TO INSTALL A NEW SEAT. THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPT HAS QUOTED $2000 FOR IT AS AN OUT-OF-WARRANTY REPAIR. IN SEARCHING ONLINE, I SEE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE MODEL.

THEN TUESDAY, WE FOUND OUT IT STILL WASN'T FIXED, AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY FOUND OUT THERE WERE NO AVAILABLE PARTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM THE VEHICLE HAS, AND THAT THE EARLIEST DELIVERY THEY CAN GET IS JULY 28TH, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING IT'S A BRAND NEW VEHICLE. THEN WE CALLED THE FORD COMPANY AND TALKED TO THE REGION MANAGER [XXX] ABOUT OUR SITUATION, AND AFTER REQUESTING FOR A LONG TIME SHE FINALLY AGREED TO GIVE US A RENTAL CAR. ALSO, BEFORE ASKING ABOUT GIVING US A LOANER CAR, I ASKED IF SHE COULD JUST REPLACE OUR VEHICLE AND GIVE US ANOTHER FORD TRANSIT CONNECT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE VEHICLE IS STILL BRAND NEW AND WE ALSO HAVE A WARRANTY.
