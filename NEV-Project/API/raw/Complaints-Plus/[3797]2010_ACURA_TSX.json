WHEN I WAS APPROACHING THE STOP SIGN I ATTEMPTED TO BREAK ONLY TO FIND THE BREAK PEDAL SOLID AND STIFF AND WOULD NOT MOVE NO MATTER HOW HARD I PUSHED. I HAD NO BREAKS WHATSOEVER. WITHIN A SHORT TIME AFTER, THE BREAKS STARTED WORKING. CONDITIONS ON BOTH OCCURRENCES WERE TEMPERATURES BELOW 10 DEGREES WITH A NEGATIVE WIND CHILL AND I HAD NOT WARMED MY CAR UP PRIOR TO DRIVING IT.     THE SECOND TIME I WAS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO GETTING T-BONED BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. THE ONLY REASON I WAS NOT HIT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BREAK. THIS TIME I IMMEDIATELY PARKED THE CAR AND CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK. THE VEHICLE IS SITTING AT A HONDA REPAIR SHOP AS THERE ARE NO ACURA DEALERS CLOSE. I CONTACTED ACURA AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO SERVICE BULLETINS ON THIS AND THAT THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY HOWEVER A LOCAL ADVOCATE FOR MY REGION WOULD CALL ME BACK ON MONDAY. TODAY IS FRIDAY.     SOMEONE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS AS WHEN I SEARCH THE FORUMS TSXCLUB.COM (BREAKS FAIL WHEN COLD), THERE ARE MULTIPLE OWNERS EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE ALSO CASES ON THIS SITE AS WELL. ACURA NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE AND ISSUE A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHEN MY TEEN DRIVER WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL.   *TR",

I TOOK IT IN TO GET SERVICED TODAY (AUGUST 5, 2011) AT THE ACURA DEALERSHIP, AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\" OF THE REAR BRAKES AND ADVISED REAR BRAKE REPLACEMENT.

I DID GET THE REAR BRAKES REPLACED BECAUSE I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF OTHERS WHILE DRIVING A CAR WITH DEFECTIVE BRAKES. BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, THIS MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT AFFECTS MANY VEHICLES, AND HONDA REFUSES TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THEIR DEFECTIVE BRAKES.

THEY TELL ME THE BRAKE PADS WORE OUT AND THAT THE ROTORS ARE DAMAGED.  I END UP HAVING TO PAY $321.20 IN REPAIRS.  I STILL AM HEARING NOISE FROM THE REAR WHEEL AS IT IS NOT FULLY REPAIRED.  I'LL HAVE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK TO TAKE IT IN YET AGAIN.  I HAVE A 2006 HONDA ELEMENT IN THE GARAGE AND I NEVER REPLACED THE PADS YET.  THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS.  I AM VERY UNHAPPY. *TR",
