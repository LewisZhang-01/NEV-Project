WHEN THE DEALER WAS CALLED DURING THE FIRST MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP TO ASK IF THEY WERE AWARE OF ANY CONCERN WITH THE FUEL GAUGE NOT READING PROPERLY NATURALLY THEY SAID NO. BECAUSE OF THIS THE CAR WAS NEVER BOUGHT INTO A DEALER FOR REPAIR.   HERE ARE EXCERPTS FROM MY LETTER TO HONDA:    RE: VIN # [XXX]    MY FIANC IS THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE.  HER ACCORD NOW HAS ABOUT 150,000 MILES ON IT.      WHEN MY FIANCE STARTED A NEW JOB AND BEGAN DRIVING THE ACCORD MORE FREQUENTLY(OVER 500 MILES/ WEEK) I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE.  FOR THE MOST PART IT ONLY REQUIRED SOME MINOR MAINTENANCE.  THE ONE ISSUE THAT I DID DISCOVER HOWEVER WAS THAT THE FUEL GAUGE DOES NOT READ FULL WHEN THE TANK IS FULL.  I ASKED MY FIANC ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE THAT SINCE THE DAY SHE FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.      I DECIDED TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE ANY BULLETINS FROM HONDA TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN.  I LEARNED ABOUT BULLETIN NO. 95-013, WHICH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE FUEL GAUGE CONCERN.

THE BULLETIN EVEN MENTIONS THAT REPAIRS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR GOODWILL CONSIDERATION AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRATION.   MY FIANC WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE SERVICE ADVISOR BASICALLY BLEW HER OFF SAYING THAT WITH THE MILEAGE SHE HAD ON THE VEHICLE THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY ASSISTANCE.

MY AUTO TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THIS SEAL WAS LAYING INSIDE THE TIMING BELT COVER. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAS REPAIRED A NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. HE ALSO TOLD ME HONDA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND HAS DESIGNED A RETAINER TO INSTALL TO KEEP THE SEAL FROM FALLING OUT. THIS RETAINER WAS INSTALLED BY HIM, PLUS A BUNCH OF OTHER BELTS THAT HAD BEEN SOAKED BY OIL AND RENDERED UNUSABLE. I HAVE NOT CONTACTED THE DEALER OR THE MANUFACTURER, BUT MY TECHNICIAN HAS TOLD ME THAT HONDA IS NOT OFFERING ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN COVERING THIS REPAIR, WHICH JUST COST ME $390.00. THIS PROBLEM COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED A COMPLETE LOSS OF OIL (IT LOST THREE QUARTS OF OIL OVER A DISTANCE OF A MILE OR LESS; IT ONLY HOLDS FOUR QUARTS!), POTENTIALLY CAUSING ENGINE LOCKUP AND THE REPLACEMENT OF AN ENGINE, PLUS OUR INCONVENIENCE. THIS IS APPARENTLY A DESIGN FLAW, AS HONDA HAS IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY DESIGNING AND MANUFACTURING THIS RETAINER FOR THE OIL PUMP SEAL. I THINK HONDA OWES ME SOME MONEY, AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A VOLUNTARY RECALL FROM HONDA TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THAT IS MY OPINION. I KNOW THE VEHICLE HAS 90000 MILES, BUT THIS WASN'T A PART THAT WORE OUT - IT FELL OUT! THAT IS PRIMARILY WHAT MY OPINION IS BASED ON.
