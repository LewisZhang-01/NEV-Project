I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT OTHERS HAVE THIS SAME OR A SIMILAR ISSUE. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN BY AN OLDER COUPLE AKA MY GRANDPARENTS WHO BOUGHT IT NEW IN 98' AND THEY BOTH PASSED AWAY IN 2012. THIS MAY BE IN PART DUE TO THE \"DOUBLE WISHBONE\" SUSPENSION WHICH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. I AM EXTRA UPSET AS I SAID DUE THE FACT THAT THIS CAR HAS ONLY HAD AN AVERAGE OF JUST OVER 2,000 MILES ANNUALLY AND WAS TREATED VERY WELL. THE CAR LOOKS LIKE NEW BUT SCARES ME HALF TO DEATH WHEN I HEAR THIS UNMISTAKABLE LOUD SOUND OF BROKEN,BINDING,LOOSE OR DEFECTIVE PARTS. I AM ABLE TO REPAIR IT BUT WAS HOPING THERE WAS A RECALL DUE TO THE SAME STORY BEING POSTED OVER AND OVER. THIS CAR,EITHER MODEL THE GS OR LS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. IF YOU ARE A PROSPECTIVE BUYER,PLEASE DRIVE THE CAR SLOWLY THEN TURN IN REVERSE AND IF IT EXISTS THE PROBLEM WILL SOUND OFF IMMEDIATELY. IF BACKING OUT WITH A VERY SLIGHT CURB,THE CAR WILL SOUND MUCH WORSE.FORD IS NOT KNOWN FOR ITS FRONT ENDS OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT ITS CARS AND TRUCKS FRONT ENDS ARE EITHER NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO ALIGN AND/OR ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR. I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ANY OTHER CAR MAKER,FORD SHOULD PAY FOR THIS TRAVESTY OF A FRONT END.
