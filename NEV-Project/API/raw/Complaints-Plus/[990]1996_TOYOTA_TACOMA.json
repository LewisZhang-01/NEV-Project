IT WAS DETERMINED THAT  THE FRAMES IN A NUMBER OF THESE VEHICLES MAY NOT HAVE CORROSION-RESISTANT PROTECTION SUFFICIENT FOR AREA WITH HIGH ROAD SALT USE. THIS CONDITION IS UN-RELATED TO NORMAL SURFACE RUST COMMONLY FOUND ON METALLIC SURFACES AFTER YEARS OF USE. I LIVE IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND WITH MY VIN, MY TRUCK CERTAINLY FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY. THE NOTICE, WHICH WAS MY FIRST AND ONLY ONE RECEIVED, CAME TO MY HOUSE 90 DAYS PAST THE 15 YEAR IN SERVICE DATE THAT TOYOTA EXTENDED THE CAMPAIGN FOR.

THE RESULTS OF THE TEST WERE IN MY OPINION MARGINAL AT BEST. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE TOYOTA SEND A FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO FURTHER INSPECT MY TRUCK FRAME. THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED AS OF YET (JULY 27TH,2011) AND TOYOTA SEEMS TO BE PLAYING A BACK AND FORTH GAME TO GET THIS DONE.

        "summary": "BAD REAR LEAF SPRINGS, CAUSING EXTREME INSTABILITY.  VEHICLE: 1996 TOYOTA TACOMA 4X4 REGULAR CAB, REGULAR BED, 4CYLINDER.  THE MIDDLE REAR LEAF SPRING HAS A TENDANCY TO BREAK, EVEN UNDER LIGHT LOADS.*AK  ON MY TRUCK, THE DRIVER'S SIDE BROKE AT AROUND 100,000 MILES, THE PASSENGER SIDE  BROKE AT ABOUT 110,000 MILES.    THIS CREATED TWO PROBLEMS:  1) THE REAR OF THE TRUCK TENDS TO LEAVE THE GROUND ON EVEN SMALL BUMPS.  2) THERE IS LESS WEIGHT TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, CAUSING A SERIOUS DEGRADATION IN STEERING CONTROL.    MY SPRINGS BROKE WITH NO LOAD, I HEARD IT HAPPEN EACH TIME.  I CONTACTED A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP  EXPECTING THERE IS SOME SORT OF RECALL ON THESE SPRINGS, THEY SAID NO, BUT THERE WAS A 'TECHNICAL BULLETIN' FOR REPLACEMENT OF THESE SPRINGS.  TOYOTA WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT, EXCEPT IF UNDER WARRANTY.  (MY WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 100,000 MILES)  THEY WANTED $345 EACH SIDE, PLUS LABOR TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED.  THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD AFFORD IT.   I  DROVE AROUND WITH FOR A YEAR AND A HALF WITH A BROKEN LEAF SPRING ON EACH SIDE,   WONDERING WHEN I WOULD GET IN A CRASH. HOW MANY OTHER TACOMA'S OUT THERE HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM? MANY!  I DID SOME RESEARCH INTO FIXING THE PROBLEM MYSELF.  I CALLED A LOCAL TOYOTA REPAIR SHOP (NOT THE DEALERSHIP), THEY STATED THAT THIS   IS A MAJOR AND VERY VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH 1996 TACOMA'S, THAT I WAS THE FOURTH CALLER FOR THAT DAY ALONE ASKING ABOUT THE SPRINGS.  DOING MORE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I LEARNED ABOUT COUNTLESS CASES OF BOTH LEAF SPRINGS BREAKING, WITH AND WITHOUT A LOAD.    THIS NEEDS TO BE A SAFETY RECALL BECAUSE THE SPRINGS ARE PRONE TO FAILURE AND  THE VEHICLE IS EXTREMELY UNSTABLE WHEN THEY ARE BROKEN.    I HAVE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL PHOTO'S AVAILABLE, THE WEB SITE  IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED HTTP://TACOMASPRINGS.HOME.COMCAST.NET         EMAIL OR CALL, I CAN SEND OUT THE WHOLE CD, I HAVE MORE THAN 50 PHOTOS TOTAL, ALL TAKEN AT 3.1MEGPIXEL.

I AGAIN COMPLAINED OF NOISE AT BEGINNING OF DECEMBER 2001. I WAS TOLD THEY COULD HEAR IT THEN (AFTER WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED!) THEY TOLD ME I HADNT CHANGED MY OIL AND IT WOULD COST 4400 DOLLARS FOR A NEW SHORT BLOCK. I KNEW I WASNT AT FAULT. I REMOVED ENGINE SO I COULD DETERMINE CAUSE OF NOISE. THE PROBLEM IS A DEFECTIVE CRANKSHAFT. IT IS NOT MACHINED CORRECTLY. IT IS NOT DRILLED THRU TO ALLOW THE FLOW OF OIL THRU THE BEARING. I SHOWED THEM THE CRANK. THEY ADMITTED IT WAS A FACTORY DEFECT. THEY WILL NOT PUT IT IN WRITING. THEIR MAY BE THOUSANDS OF OTHER TRUCKS WHOSE OWNERS ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF FOR THE COST OF A NEW ENGINE. THEY WILL BE TOLD THEY DIDNT CHANGE THEIR OIL. TOYOTA WILL POCKET ALOT OF MONEY. THE OWNERS WILL BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THIS MAJOR SCAM. TOYOTA MUST ADMIT IN WRITING THEY WERE MADE AWARE OF THIS. THEY MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD. THE ENGINE COULD FAIL IN TRAFFIC CAUSING SEVERE ACCIDENTS.*AK",
