        "summary": "NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 07E033000  CUMMINGS ENGINE SERIAL NUMBER 46565687    ON 6/02/2015 THE WRIST PIN FAILED ON THIS ENGINE THAT FALL IN THE SERIAL NUMBER RANGE 46543077 TO 46603939.  THE WRIST PIN FAILED WHILE DRIVING ON LA 1 ABOUT TO TURN ONTO I49 CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE. THE ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED. CONTACTED TIFFIN ABOUT IT AND LOCAL CUMMINS DEALER AT TIME OF FAILURE.  TIFFIN WAS UNAWARE OF RECALL AND LOCAL CUMMINS DEALER WOULD NOT WORK ON THE MOTOR HOME.  HAD A LOCAL ENGINE COMPANY DO THE REPLACEMENT OF ENGINE AND THEY WERE NEVER MADE AWARE OF THE RECALL.    LAST NIGHT WHILE RESEARCHING THE INTERNET, I STUMBLED UPON THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER.  CALLED TIFFIN TO CONFIRM ENGINE SERIAL NUMBER WAS 46565687 AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER.  ALSO CONFIRMED WITH CONSOLIDATED  TRUCK & SERVICE AGAIN TO CONFIRM THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN WHICH WAS \"NO\".  THEN PROCEEDED TO CALL CUMMINGS 1-800-343-7357 AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO THE \"LOCAL\" DEALER.  SINCE THAT IS WHERE THE MOTOR HOME ORIGINALLY, THEY REFUSED TO WORK ON IT, WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED ELSEWHERE THEN WHO INSIDE CUMMINGS DID I TALK TOO?  AT THAT POINT HE TOLD ME HE COULDN'T HELP ME AND WOULD NOT TRANSFER ME HIS BOSS.      AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE A CONTACT AT CUMMINS WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM AND WILLING TO WORK ON COVERING THE COST OF REPLACING THE ENGINE THAT OBVIOUSLY FAILED DUE TO A KNOWN PROBLEM.
