Several have been safety concerns: - Transmission is slow to engage when first pushing accelerator, leading to unexpected lag pulling into traffic - Transmission did not shift into park as expected, causing car to keep moving as I was opening door and starting to step out - Transmission slips and does not respond when accelerating to merge into fast lane on highway to pass slower traffic. Car speed stalls and you have to let off the gas and wait for a few seconds before the transmission reengages. - Overall horrible/hard shifting all the time... to which we're told... the car learns your driving style.  We've reset it multiple times to try to get it to start learning again.  No luck. - After coasting on highway, very hard shift with loud noise when you go to hit the accelerator  All of these situations have happened numerous times over the past 2 years of owning this car. All of them infrequent, but also unexpected... leaving you to really worry if this is the time the transmission is going to let you down and cause you to wreck.  Dealer now says a new transmission is needed, but I waited until 78,000 miles to first report it, so it's out of warranty now. Hoping Acura will step up and address this serious safety issue with the 9 speed transmission.",

I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I JUST KEPT GOING TO EMERGENCY STOPPING LINE WHERE I ALMOST CRASH INTO THE CONCRETE DIVIDER. I MANAGE TO STOP VEHICLE SAFELY BY PURE LUCK. AFTER STOPPING I NOTICE THAT CAR IS NOT SHIFTING, AND SH-AWD SYSTEM, BLIND SPOT ASS, EMISSION SYSTEM AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FAULT LIGHTS CAME ON. I CALLED INSURANCE AGENT TO SEND ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE, BUT WHILE WAITING ON THE CALL I START THE CAR AGAIN (LIKE 15MIN AFTER THIS INCIDENT) AND ALL LIGHTS WERE STILL ON EXCEPT TRANSMISSION. I TRIED CAR AND IT WAS SHIFTING NORMALLY NOW, EXCEPT SH-AWD WAS NOT WORKING (I DIDNT HAVE POWER TO THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL). THIS COULD BE VERY TRAGIC EVENT IF BOTH ME AND THE DRIVER BEHIND ME DIDNT REACT PROPERLY. I HAD TWO MORE PASSENGERS IN THE CAR, FROM WHICH ONE WAS 15 MONTHS OLD CHILD. I WAS READING THAT THIS COULD BE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM UPDATE ISSUE, BUT MY DEALER DID UPDATE TRANSMISSION ALREADY.",

ON 10/18 MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON THE FREE WAY AND IT SLOWED TO A STALL.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. I HAVE PASTED A URL TO THE RECALL BELOW. THE DEALER REFUSED TO FIX MY FUEL INJECTORS OR REPLACE MY FUEL PUMP.  THE ARE OFFERING A FREE FUEL PUMP SOFTWARE UPGRADED BUT THEY WANT ME TO PAY TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL INJECTORS.

WHEN I REALIZED IT WAS RED, I BRAKED RAPIDLY OF COURSE BUT STILL GOING AT A PRETTY GOOD SPEED I HIT THE STOPPED CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  THE COLLISION WAS BETWEEN DRIVERS SIDE OF MY MDX AND RIGHT REAR OF A MEDIUM-SIZED WHITE JEEP.  MY 17 YR OLD SON WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND HIS AIR BAG DEPLOYED, HOWEVER MY DRIVER BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.   BOTH SEAT BELTS LOCKED UP.  THE IMPACT WAS VERY STRONG ON DRIVER SIDE GIVEN THAT IS WHERE WE HIT.   FORTUNATELY, MY SEAT BELT KEPT ME FROM HITTING THE WINDSHIELD.   MY ONLY INJURIES ARE NECK ACHE, HEAD ACHE, SEAT BELT BRUISES, AND RINGING EARS.        MY CONCERN IS FOR FUTURE USE OF MY CAR.   IF THE DRIVER AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY GIVEN THIS HARD OF A HIT, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL DEPLOY IN ANY COLLISION.   I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH ACURA REQUESTING THEM TO INSPECT THE AIRBAG AND BLACK BOX TO DETERMINE WHY IT DID NOT DEPLOY AND THEY SAID THAT AIRBAGS ARE DESIGNED TO ONLY DEPLOY WHEN NEEDED AND IN THIS CASE THE CARS COMPUTER DETERMINED IT WAS NOT NEEDED HENCE THERE IS NO REASON TO INSPECT IT FURTHER.   I BELIEVE THAT IF THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHERE THE IMPACT WAS LESS THEN THE AIR BAG SHOULD HAVE ALSO DEPLOYED ON THE DRIVER SIDE.     MY INSURANCE ADJUSTER ALSO SUPPOSEDLY REQUESTED ACURA TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE AND THEY ALSO DID NOT GET ANY FAVORABLE ACTION FROM ACURA.    HONDA/ACURA OF AMERICA RETURNED MY PHONE CALLS TWICE AND SIMPLY SAID THERE IS NO SUPPORTING INFORMATION INDICATING THAT THE AIRBAG OR CARS COMPUTER SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.

YOU SHOULD GO AFTER ACURA BEFORE SOMEONE HAS TO DIE AS A RESULT OF ACURA'S NEGLIGENCE.

SUDDENLY, THE TRANSMISSION WILL ENGAGE WITH A SHARP ENGAGEMENT (METAL SOUND) OF THE TRANSMISSION AFTER ABOUT 6-10 SECONDS. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER AS THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES.  THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT HELP ME SINCE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION AND THEY HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.   LAST WEEK SIMILAR SITUATION OCCURRED EXCEPT THE DASHBOARD ERROR LIGHTS SHOWED SH-AWD, EMISSIONS, TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND REAR SIDE WARNING INDICATOR FAULT.  I HAD TO PULL OF ONTO THE SIDE OF ROAD. ONCE IN PARK THE CAR WOULD ONLY GO INTO SPORT MODE IN FIRST GEAR.  CALLED ACURA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALER.  NEXT MORNING THEY SAID IT WAS OK.  ONCE THEY TESTED VIA DIAGNOSTICS THEY SAID THERE WERE ERRORS IN THE TRANSMISSION MODULATOR.  HOPE THIS FIXES THE PROBLEM.  CAR HAS 36K MILES ON THE ODOMETER.
