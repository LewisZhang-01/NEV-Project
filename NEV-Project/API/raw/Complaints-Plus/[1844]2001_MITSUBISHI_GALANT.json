I WAS TOLD THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE PAINT. I CALLED BACK A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WAS TOLD THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER SO THEY COULD DETERMINE IF IT WAS DEFECTIVE. AFTER TAKING PICTURES THE DEALER AND CORPORATE AGREED THE PAINT JOB WAS DEFECTIVE. THEY HAD MY CAR FOR 1.5 WEEKS WITHOUT PROVIDING ME WITH A CAR TO DRIVE. I GOT MY CAR BACK TODAY AND THE AREAS THEY PAINTED LOOK GREAT, BUT THEY DIDN'T PAINT THE WHOLE CAR SO COLORS DO NOT MATCH. WITHIN A YEAR THERE IS GOING TO BE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THE CORPORATE OFFICE SAID THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYMORE ABOUT IT. WHERE HAS CUSTOMER SERVICE WENT. I FOR ONE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MITSUBISHI MADE PRODUCT AT ALL. IF YOU GOOGLE BLACK MITSUBISHI GALANTS WITH BAD PAINT JOBS YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM. IT LOOKS LIKE THE PROBLEM STARTED WITH THE 1999 MODELS AND CONTINUES TO THE 2001 MODELS. I'M SURE THE 2002'S WILL BE NEXT.

THE DEALER DIAGNOSED IS AS SHIFT SURGE AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION HAD A LEAK, RESULTING IN LOW FLUID  THAT OVERHEATED THE TRANSMISSION AND CAUSED INTERNAL DAMAGE.  THE SURGE OCCURRED ON AND OFF FOR JUST A WEEK.  NOW THEY SAY WE HAVE TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AND QUOTE  OF $2,000 PLUS FOR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  THEY STATED THAT IF WE HAD TAKEN THE CAR TO THEM THE FIRST SIGN OF SHIFTING, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT.  A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR THIS CAR FOR TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAKS.  I HAD TAKEN THIS CAR TO THE SAME DEALER IN OCTOBER NO ONE MENTIONED ANY RECALLS.      IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW A TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITHIN FOUR YEARS.  HOW CAN I DETERMINE IF THE PREVIOUS OWNER ACTUALLY HAD THE WORK DONE THAT WAS NECESSARY PER THE RECALL?  IF IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE, WHAT LIABILITY DOES THE DEALER REGARDING THIS?  THE DEALER SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS.    I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED IN 2004 FOR SHIFT SURGE.  THIS IS EXACTLY THE RESULT OF THIS INTERNAL DAMAGE.  IF THE DEALERSHIP RECEIVED THIS IN 2004, WHAT IS THEIR OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THE CARS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY SERVED PER THE BULLETIN?  MAY I SEE THE SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE?

I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH IS GOSSETT MITSUBISHI HERE IN MEMPHIS, TN AT LEAST FOUR TIMES SINCE LAST NOVEMBER REGARDING TRANSMISSION ISSUES. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING IS THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY SLUGGISHLY AFTER I HAVE DRIVEN AROUND 100 MILES STRAIGHT AT ABOUT 70 TO 75 MPH. THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THE LAST PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH MY VEHICLE WAS DURING ANOTHER ROAD TRIP. THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION AGAIN SHIFTED SLUGGISHLY AND THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION RAN HOT AND SPEWED OUT TRANSMISSION FLUID WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO SMOKE BADLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I HAD TO PULL OVER ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHICH MADE FOR A LONG TRIP HOME. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG. THE SERVICE MANAGER NAMED [XXX] RECOMMENDED THAT I HAVE THEM INSTALL AN AFTER-MARKET CONDENSER TO HELP KEEP THE TRANSMISSION FLUID COOL. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO AGREE TO THIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE. THIS AFTER-MARKET CONDENSER THAT WAS INSTALLED AT THIS DEALERSHIP IS NOT A MITSUBISHI PRODUCT. WILSON STATED TO ME THAT THIS PRODUCT IS USED MAINLY ON VEHICLES THAT ARE USED FOR TOWING, BUT I HAVE NEVER USED MY VEHICLE FOR TOWING NOR DOES IT HAVE A TOWING PACKAGE.
