THE CAR HAD AN ALIGNMENT AT ABOUT 7,000 MILES AT THE DEALER, JAGUAR ORLANDO, ON 10/8/19.    ON 7/4/19, WHILE DRIVING ON HWY 408 IN ORLANDO A SEVERE VIBRATION STARTED AT ABOUT 60 MPH. UP UNTIL 7/4/19, NO PREVIOUS INCIDENTS OCCURRED INVOLVING MY TIRES, WHICH WERE WEARING NORMALLY PRIOR TO 7/4/19.     AFTER PULLING OFF THE HWY, THE REAR PASSENGER TIRE EXPLODED AT A STOP LIGHT. I CHANGED THE TIRE USING THE SPARE AND NOTICED THE OTHER THREE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE WERE SPLITTING ON THE INSIDE EXPOSING THE METAL INSIDE THE TIRE.     AFTER THE DEALER, JAGUAR ORLANDO, RECEIVED THE VEHICLE BY FLATBED THEY INDICATED ALL FOUR TIRES NEEDED REPLACEMENT.     AFTER CALLING JAGUAR LAND ROVER'S CUSTOM SERVICE CENTER, I WAS MADE AWARE THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE PIRELLI CINTURATO P7, BUT WERE STILL INVESTIGATING. REFERENCE NUMBER 8000 650617. ASK FOR THE RECORDED CALLS ON 7/12/19 TO VALIDATE THEIR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.     IN CONTRAST, PIRELLI'S CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER INDICATED THAT THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH THIS TIRE. CASE TRACKING NUMBER 54717.     IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE NHTSA IMMEDIATELY INQUIRE WITH ALL PARTIES, SUBPOENA INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE PIRELLI CINTURATO P7 INSTALLED AS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE JAGUAR XF, AND ANALYZE MY TIRES TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS A WIDESPREAD DEFECT THAT NEEDS AN IMMEDIATE NATIONAL RECALL.     MY REASON FOR INQUIRING WITH THE NHRSA IS TO ENSURE THE LIVES OF OTHER JAGUAR OWNERS AND BYSTANDERS DRIVING ON THESE TIRES ARE NOT AT RISK.    PLEASE LET ME KNOW THE OUTCOME. THANK YOU!",
