We took the vehicle to another dealership and they gave us a better price and said that two other vehicles were in the shop in front of our vehicle for the same issue and some were newer 2019 or later vehicles and that this was a common problem because of defective parts.  They said that the new parts were better and should work without the same problem.  We do not have our vehicle back yet, I expect it back in a couple days because they had to order the parts.  If this is a common problem, the dealerships know what is wrong and how to fix the problem, why is Chevrolet not letting owners know and take care of the problem before they fail and we end up with a large invoice.

The vehicle stays in a garage full time, only has 38700 miles on the engine and I have had nothing but problems since it was purchased.  During one trip two spark plugs were dead, had to be replaced.  One trip the battery was dead so I had to get a battery maintainer and keep on the engine battery.  Trip to Florida the front window leaked and after that one stationary side window leaked.  One trip the rear air conditioner did not work the first time it was used because it was not grounded.    I have already decided to never buy another Chevrolet product in the future even though i have not used anything else since getting out of college in 1973.  Enough is enough.",

I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE SIDE DOOR BLACK FASCIA FLEW OFF, THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED 3 STATING IT WAS STILL UNDER THE 34K WARRANTY. I HAD REQUESTED THEY REPLACE/SECURE THE 4TH AND WAS TOLD IT WAS FINE AND DIDN'T NEED REPLACING. I RETURNED FOR AN OIL CHANGE ABOUT 6 MONTHS LATER AND REPORTED THE ONE THAT WAS NOT REPLACED IS NOW LOOSE AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP I WAS OUT OF MY WARRANTY PERIOD AND WOULD BE CHARGED AN HOUR LABOR AS WELL AS PARTS, COSTING ROUGHLY $120.00. I THEN HAD MY AC GO OUT IN SUMMER OF 2019 AND HAD THAT REPLACED SUPPOSEDLY A RECALL. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR AN OIL CHANGE IN FALL 2019 I MENTIONED MY CAR WAS NOT STOPPING PROPERLY WHILE BRAKING AND THEY INFORMED ME THERE WAS A CURRENT RECALL THAT WOULD FIX THE ISSUE AND THAT WAS PERFORMED. I WAS STILL NOTICING THE BRAKING ISSUES. IN NOV.2019 I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE MISFIRING WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND NOT SHIFTING CORRECTLY. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND ON THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP IT WORSENED AND I HAD TO GET IT TOWED. I WAS INFORMED I WOULD NOT GET A LOANER CAR AS ALL OF THEIRS WERE OUT TO PEOPLE WITH PARTS REQUIRED WITHOUT AN ETA FROM GM. I WAS CALLED 4 DAYS LATER AS I HAD NOT HEARD BACK AND WAS TOLD MY CAR NEEDED A REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS A NEW VACUUM PUMP AS THIS HAD FAILED AND IS THE REASON FOR THE HARD BRAKING. THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AND I WAS TOLD TO PICK UP MY VEHICLE BECAUSE THE VACUUM PUMP IS ON BACK-ORDER WITHOUT AN ETA AND \"I STILL HAVE MY ABS THAT WILL ASSIST WITH STOPPING\".",

STATED THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THIS YEAR MODEL OF VEHICLE 2015 TAHOE LTZ. THE LEFT FRONT STRUT WAS ALSO LEAKING.  WAS ADVISED THIS SYSTEM IS CONTROLLED ELECTRONICALLY TO ADJUST THE RIDE AND HAVE ALL FOUR STRUT/SHOCKS WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO LEVEL OUT FOR A SMOOTH RIDE. WELL $1900.00 DOLLARS FOR THE REAR INSTALLED AND ABOUT $1000.0 FOR THE FRONT. SO $3000.00 DOLLARS LATER NO COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ON A VEHICLE WITH LESS THEN 60K MILES IS NOT GOOD. HELL MY FIRST SET OF FACTORY TIRES OUT LASTED THE MECHANICAL SHOCKS/STRUTS. IT APPEARS CHEVY HAS A ISSUE THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO FIX OR DO A RECALL NOTICE ON. THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE IN VEHICLE HANDLING IN CURVES AND HILLS?",

THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO SEVERAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS, CHEVROLET CUSTOMER CARE AND ELEVATED TO CHEVROLET ENGINEERING IN AT LEAST TWO CASES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE KEY FOB INSIDE THE CAR REMAINS ACTIVE AND ALLOWS ANYONE TO ENTER THE CAR, BECAUSE IT IS NOW UNLOCKED, START AND DRIVE IT AWAY. 4) THE UNFORTUNATE BUT POSSIBLE FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING THE CAR UNLOCKED AND DRIVABLE IS THAT IT COULD BE STOLEN AND INVOLVED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT.

ON 9 APRIL 2015 THE SERVICE MANAGER, ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER, MASTER TECHNICIAN, AND I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR A TEST DRIVE. WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT MODERATE HIGHWAY SPEEDS I DEMONSTRATED THE VARIOUS PHASES AND OPERATION OF VEHICLE DETECTION. THE FCA HAS PLENTY OF SENSITIVITY AND DETECTS VEHICLES IN EXCESS OF THE SPECIFIED DISTANCE IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL WHICH IS NOT AN ISSUE. AT A MODERATE CLOSING RATE BETWEEN VEHICLES THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ICON CHANGES FROM GREEN TO AMBER-ORANGE WHICH APPEARS NOMINAL. HOWEVER, THE RED ALARM HEADS-UP WINDSHIELD DISPLAY, RAPID HIGH-PITCHED BEEPS AND RED ICON ARE NEVER ACTIVATED UNTIL A CLOSING DISTANCE ABOUT ~3 FEET BEFORE A COLLISION. THERE IS VIRTUALLY ZERO REACTION TIME FOR A DRIVER TO BRAKE THE VEHICLE AT LESS THAN ONE CAR LENGTH BEFORE GOING TO RED. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO DISENGAGE THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL (ACC). CONSIDERING TIME, RATE, AND DISTANCE THIS IS INEFFECTIVE AS THE MASS AND KINETIC ENERGY ALSO NEEDS TO FULLY DISENGAGE BEFORE A POTENTIAL COLLISION. BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF CREATING A TRAFFIC INCIDENT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TESTED TO THE LEVEL OF A FULL COLLISION.

PRIOR TO THE RECALL, I KEPT THE SCREEN ON THE DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
