SO SHE PARKED THIS ONE AND BOUGHT A NEW ONE. IT WAS PARKED FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS BEFORE I STARTED DRIVING IT. SINCE IT WAS SITTING FOR A WHILE I DID CHANGE THE OIL AND MAKE SURE OTHER FLUIDS WERE TOPPED OFF. RIGHT AWAY, I NOTICE THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHIFTING HARD AND SLIPPING A LITTLE. SO I PULLED OVER AND CHECKED THE GRANNY FLUID WHICH WAS PERFECT! I JUST FIGURED MAYBE IT JUST NEEDED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE AND LUBE EVERYTHING UP AGAIN. I CHECKED THE FLUID DAILY WITH NO CHANGE TO THE LEVEL. A WEEK LATER IT'S STILL THE SAME. WITH NO IMPROVEMENT I DRAINED A LITTLE FLUID OUT AND ADDED LUCAS AS RECOMMENDED BY MY HONDA SERVICE TECH. STILL NO IMPROVEMENT. I RESEARCHED A LITTLE AND FOUND THAT THIS IS COMMON TO START HAVING ISSUES AROUND 150K MILES. THAT'S HARDLY ANY MILES FOR A HONDA! IN FURTHER RESEARCH I FIND THAT NEARLY EVERY HONDA FOR SALE IS BEING SOLD DUE TO THE START OF GRANNY PROBLEMS AND EVERY ONE THAT'S BEING PARTED OUT IS BEING PARTED OUT BECAUSE THE GRANNY WENT OUT. SO NO LUCK ON A USED GRANNY SWAP! I AM ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED THAT WITH THE EXCELLENT REPUTATION HONDA HAS THAT THIS HASN'T BEEN A PART OF A RECALL! I MEAN COME ON HONDA...I REALIZE THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PART TO HAVE RECALLED, BUT WHEN YOUR REPUTATION GOES DOWN THE TOILET OVER THE 6TH GEN ACCORD TRANSMISSION...WHAT WILL EFFECT THE COMPANIES WORTH MORE? THE COST OF THIS BECOMING A RECALL AND REPLACING THESE TRANSMISSIONS OR THE DECLINE IN FUTURE SALES DUE TO NOT REPAIRING THE VEHICLES THAT PEOPLE PAY HARD EARNED MONEY FOR?!",

I UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS BUT NOT ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO INVOLVE A RECALL.      I AM WRITING TO YOU IN REGARDS TO A SAFETY CONCERN WITH MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD. THE SUBFRAME OF MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD LX HAS ROTTED THROUGH. THIS IS LOCATED ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE NEAR THE STRUT ASSEMBLY, BENEATH THE AIR CONDITIONER DRAIN, AS NOTED BY OTHERS ON POSTING ON THE INTERNET. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE SUBFRAME WAS RUSTED DUE TO THE AIR CONDITIONER HOSE LEAKING. THE VEHICLE IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION OTHERWISE, ESPECIALLY WITH VERY LOW MILES (77,000) THERE IS NO OTHER ROT ON THE VEHICLE. MY MECHANIC SAYS IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. IT APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF A DESIGN FLAW RELATING TO THE LOCATION OF THE AIR CONDITIONER DRAIN. HONDA SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DESIGN FLAW AND BE ACCOUNTABLE TO REPAIR THIS UNSAFE SITUATION. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY HONDA CORP. THESE VEHICLES SHOULD BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY GIVEN THE MOUNTING EVIDENCE OF THIS FLAW BEFORE SOME POOR UNAWARE SOUL IS HURT.     I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT ANOTHER DESIGN FLAW WITH MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD. THE CAR'S CLEAR COAT IS PEELING AND HAS BEEN SINCE ABOUT 2013, WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THEIR ATTENTION I WAS INFORMED MANY OTHERS OF THE SAME CAR HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I EXPLAINED  I WENT TO A PROFESSIONAL PAINT PLACE AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS EITHER THE WAY IT WAS APPLIED OR THE BATCH LOT WAS A BAD CATCH AND YOU CAN TYPICALLY ISOLATE IT TO AN AREA OR MANUFACTURER. I HAVE NOT HAD MY CAR REPAINTED AS I BELIEVE THAT HONDA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DESIGN DEFECT AND THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THIS TO BE REPAINTED.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME REGARDING THESE ISSUES.

I WAS ALSO GETTING ENGINE WARNING SIGN ON MY DASH BOARD. AFTER AIRBAG REPAIR I RETURNED HOME AND  FOUND FOLLOWING COMMENT ON MY INVOICE :     \"REDESIGNED AIRBAG INFLATORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSTALLATION AT THIS TIME.\"     NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALER AND AMERICAN HONDA. DEALER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY VOICEMAIL AND AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WILL RESPOND WITHIN 24-48 HOURS. SO FAR NO ONE HAS REACHED OUT TO ME. MY QUESTION TO THEM WAS IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THE REDESIGNED AIRBAG INFLATORS THEN HOW HAVE YOU FIXED THE AIRBAG RECALL ISSUE.    REGARDING DASHBOARD ENGINE WARNING SIGN DEALER SAID I NEED TO INSTALL EGA PIPE KIT TO AVOID CLOGGING OF EGA PORT. HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AS PER THEIR SERVICE BULLETIN 99-085 AND WERE SUPPOSED TO INSTALL THE EGA PIPE KIT FREE OF COST. HONDA NEVER SENT ME ANY COMMUNICATION NOR ANY OF PAST HONDA DEALERS INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER ASKED ME $650 TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND EVEN CHARGED ME $107 FOR DIAGNOSIS OF THIS PROBLEM WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED EARLIER BY AUTOZONE TECHNICIAN IN JUST 1 MINUTE FOR FREE.    HONDA DEALER EVEN REFUSED TO DO STATE INSPECTION SAYING MY CAR WILL FAIL THE INSPECTION IF THIS KIT IS NOT INSTALLED. I ASKED BOTH AMERICAN HONDA AND DEALER TO INSTALL EGR KIT FOR FREE SINCE IT'S A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THEIR ENGINE BUT SO FAR BOTH OF THEM HAVE REFUSED TO INSTALL IT FOR FREE.    I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO TAKE THESE ISSUES WITH HONDA ESPECIALLY THE AIRBAG, EGR PORT ISSUE AND LACK OF  COMMUNICATION REGARDING PROBLEMS IN THEIR CARS. NO WONDER HONDA COMES AT TOP IN QUALITY SURVEYS SINCE THEY ARE NOT TRANSPARENT ENOUGH TO COMMUNICATE PROBLEMS WITH NHTSA OR CUSTOMERS. I AM WORRIED ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY'S SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THIS CAR.  THANKS.  *TR",

HOWEVER, THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG NEVER DEPLOYED. THIS CAUSED VIOLENT ROCKING OF HIS HEAD RESULTING INTO SEVER SIMULTANEOUS HEMORRHAGE OF BOTH EYES AND ULTIMATELY LEADING UP TO TOTAL LOSS OF HIS VISION.

I WAS NOT PLEASED THAT A HONDA COULD NEED A NEW TRANNY WITH THAT LOW MILEAGE (WE MOVED TO HOLLAND FOR FOUR YEARS AND THE CAR SAT DURING THE '01- PRESENT). BUT, I LOOKED AT MY SERVICE RECORDS AND NOTICED THAT HONDA HAD ALREADY INSTALLED A 2ND TRANSMISSION IN 2003. WHAT? THIS NOW MEANS THAT THIS NEW ONE WOULD BE THE THIRD TRANSMISSION IN A CAR WITH 69,900 HIGHWAY MILES.?!?!?! HONDA AMERICA, ALONG WITH MY DEALER, SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AS THE TIME WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED (7 YEARS, 8 MONTHS THEY SAID THEY EXTENDED IT TO BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS YEAR'S TRANSMISSION. I EXPLAINED, \"OKAY, FINE, THEN NATURALLY WE MUST TAKE BOTH TRANSMISSIONS THAT HAVE FAILED AND ADD THE YEARS=APPX. 11.6-12 YEARS. NOW, THE MILEAGE AND THE TIME SHOULD BE COVERED. THEY MUST NEED AN ABBASID BECAUSE MY MATH DID NOT COMPUTE WITH THEM. WHY AM I WRITING? I READ ONLINE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THESE FAULTY CARS ON THE ROAD AND LAST SATURDAY WHEN WE WERE STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT, IT TURNED GREEN, I PRESSED DOWN ON THE PEDAL, AND NOTHING; NO MOVEMENT. WE WERE THEN, VERY LIGHTLY BECAUSE THE LIGHT HAD JUST CHANGED, HIT IN THE BACK. MY 5 AND 9 YEAR OLD SONS WERE IN THEIR CAR SEATS AND WERE VERY FRIGHTENED AND UPSET. HONDA AMERICA IS AWARE OF THIS FAULTY DESIGN AND YET REFUSES TO OFFER A HONEST AND GOODWILL SAFETY/SERVICE RECALL. WHAT IF THE ACCIDENT HAD BEEN WORSE AND MY DEALER HAD KEPT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSSIBLE ACCIDENT TO THEMSELVES JUST TO MAKE $5000? I BELIEVE EACH OF MY CHILDREN WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN $2500 APIECE!  *TR",

HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE SOME ISSUES IN THE PAST WITH ACCORD TRANSMISSIONS.     ON THE SAME DAY, I CALLED HONDA AND SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE THAT WORKED IN THE RECALL DEPARTMENT. HE TOLD ME THAT HONDA DID INDEED HAVE TRANSMISSION FAILURE ISSUES WITH THE HONDA ACCORD OF THAT YEAR; BUT THAT MY HONDA WOULD NOT BE COVERED BECAUSE IT HAD 130,000 MILES VS. THE WARRANTY COVERAGE OF 109,000 MILES.

DIAGNOSIS: NEW TORQUE CLUTCH CONVERTER, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, A NEWLY REBUILT TRANSMISSION HAD TO FOLLOW. NOW, KEEP IN MIND THAT I SAID I HAD TO MISS WORK AND CLASS. THIS MEANS I AM A POOR COLLEGE STUDENT, IN WHICH CASE A $2050.00 AUTO REPAIR BILL IS A DEATH SENTENCE AND A COLLECTION NOTICE ALL NEATLY WRAPPED AS A PACKAGE DEAL. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IF YOUR TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPAIR AND REPLACING, ARE YOU IN A STABLE FINANCIAL CONDITION AT WHICH POINT YOU COULD SHELL OUT OVER TWO GRAND FOR YOUR AUTO REPAIR BILL? IF YOU CAN, CONGRATULATIONS, AND FEEL FREE TO DONATE TO MY CHARITY AT ANY TIME, IF NOT... WELCOME TO THE CLUB. HONDA HAS ADMITTED THAT THE TORQUE CLUTCH CONVERTERS IN MY HONDA AND THOSE SIMILAR TO MINE ARE DEFECTIVE BUT NO RECALL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE IS NO DIRECT SAFELY HAZARD. WITH THAT SAID, IF HONDA KNOWS THEY BUILT MY CAR WITH A DEFECTIVE PIECE OF MACHINERY, I WOULD LIKE THEM TO PAY FOR MY NEW PIECE OF MACHINERY WITH NO QUESTION, DEBATE, SARCASM, EXCUSE, ANGER, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF NEGATIVE REACTION POSSIBLE. *TR",

NOW, THE LATEST MAJOR PROBLEM IS INTERNAL TRANS FAILURE AND FLUID LEAK DIAGNOSED BY HONDA, A DIAGNOSIS THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR. THIS IS UNHEARD OF IN A CAR WITH 55K MILEAGE. HONDA SOLD THE CARS WITH DEFECTIVE TRAN SYSTEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BECAUSE OF WHICH THEY EXTENDED THEIR WARRANTY. NOW, I AM OUT OF THE WARRANTY BY JUST 3 MONTHS.  THEY HAVE ASKED ME TO PAY AROUND $700 TO REPAIR IT. HONDA SHOULD COVER 100% OF THE REPAIR COST. I AM PRETTY SURE THAT I WILL HAVE TO AGAIN REPLACE THE NEW TRAN SYSTEM AS SOON AS ITS WARRANTY PERIOD EXPIRES. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CAR IS DRIVING FUNNY AND USING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GAS.  WHEN I CALLED CUSTOMER CARE AND TOLD THEM THAT THE FUEL ECONOMY PROBLEM (DUE TO TRAN FAILURE) HAD STARTED ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO (WHEN I WAS WELL WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD), THEY SAID THAT I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT TO A DEALERSHIP BEFORE.

HE ALSO SAID THAT HONDA DOES NOT HAVE A RECALL OR EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS PROBLEM. READING THE INTERNET CHAT ROOMS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. IN FACT MANY OWNERS INDICATED THAT AFTER THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A COLLISION THEIR AIRBAGS NEVER DID DEPLOY EVEN AFTER THE SRS LIGHT WAS RESET BY THEIR DEALER. THE COST OF THE REPAIR, FOR ME, WILL BE FROM $1000 TO $1500. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED AT THIS TIME. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEAT BELTS HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY BUT NOT THE AIRBAGS. I FEEL THE AIRBAGS SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AS THE SEAT BELTS AND HAVE THE SAME WARRANTY. AT THE VERY LEAST HONDA SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM THEY HAVE WITH THIS MODEL AND GIVE THE OWNERS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO COVER THESE REPAIRS. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS THERE ARE MANY OWNERS THAT ARE DRIVING THESE DEFECTIVE HONDA ACCORDS AND IF INVOLVED IN A COLLISION THEIR HONDA'S AIRBAGS WILL NOT INFLATE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND HAVE HONDA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM AND GIVE SOME RELIEF TO ALL THE OWNERS OF THIS MODEL AUTOMOBILE. *TR",

ON JUNE 21, 2007 I TOOK THE  HONDA  TO DEALER  FOR A NOISE IN THE REAR OF THE CAR, IT TURNED OUT TO BE REAR STABILIZER JOINTS, BOTH OF THEM WERE REPLACED.  NOT EVEN A WEEK LATER, I AM DRIVING HOME FROM A SHORT TRIP AND HEAR THIS LOUD POP LIKE MY TIRE BLEW UP. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING,  THE NEXT THING I KNEW SOMETHING WAS SCRAPING THE ROAD, AND I COULD SEE SOME SMOKE IN  THE  REAR VIEW MIRROR, I SOMEHOW STOPPED THE CAR AND MY MOTHER AND I GET OUT.  FORTUNATELY, WE WEREN'T KILLED, A LOWER BALL JOINT SEPARATED AND PULLED THE AXLE OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION AND FLUID LEAKED ALL OVER.  I NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM A HONDA, ESPECIALLY WHEN I TOOK GOOD CARE OF  THE CAR.  MY NEXT QUESTION WAS  THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A LOWER BALL JOINT,WAS IT SOMETHING THAT COULD GO OR BREAK  APART.   ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN WITH NO WARNING SIGNS.  WHEN REPAIRING THE CAR I HAD THE DEALER CHECK THE OTHER BALL JOINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THEY NOTICED SOME PLAY OR MOVEMENT IN THEM.  SO THEY REPLACED THE UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE.  WHICH WAS ALSO ODD TO ME THAT 3 OUT OF 4 BALL JOINTS NEEDED REPLACEMENT  AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. I HAD THE CAR INSPECTED AT THE HONDA DEALER IN OCTOBER 2006, AND DURING AN INSPECTION I UNDERSTOOD THAT BALL JOINTS WERE TO BE LOOKED AT.  IF SO, HOW COME I WAS NOT INFORMED OF ANY RUST IN THE BALL JOINTS AT THAT TIME.  HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD IN 8 MONTHS TIME TO CAUSE SUCH A CATASTROPHE.  *AK",

IF MY VEHICLE MEETS THE CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN YOUR REPORT, WHY IS THE DEALERSHIP NOT HONORING THEIR WARRANTY EXTENSION?  TODAY, THE MAINTENANCE DEPT AT SF HONDA SUGGESTED THAT THE HORN WAS CONNECTED TO THE AIRBAG ELECTRONIC SENSORS AND THAT IF I WANTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THAT NO PART OF SERVICE WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    I UNDERSTAND THAT IN INVESTIGATION #PE05043, YOU HAVE NOT TESTED TO SEE IF THIS DEFECT IS A VALID SAFETY ISSUE.

THE RESULT IS AN UNEXPECTED BANG FEELING AND AN ABNORMALLY FAST ACCELERATION TIME WHICH FOR SURE WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT ONE DAY.  (FOR SOMETHING TO COMPARE BY, ITS LIKE PUTTING GAS UNTIL YOUR RPMS REACH OVER 5000 IN A STANDARD CAR AND THEN SUDDENLY POPPING THE CLUTCH)  THE TRANSMISSION ALSO DOES NOT SHIFT PROPERLY INTO GEAR, OFTEN TIMES SHIFTING EXTREMELY EARLY CAUSING ME TO HAVE A FEELING \"LIKE I PLOWED INTO SOMEONE AND THEN SUDDENLY WAS HIT BEHIND\".   I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO WINDWARD HONDA AND THE PEOPLE THERE INCLUDING THE SHOP FOREMAN CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THE HUGE BANG AND ABNORMAL SHIFTING IS NORMAL. WITHIN ONE DAY AFTER I TOOK THE CAR IN I ALMOST RAN INTO A PARKING STRUCTURE PILLAR WHEN THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT CATCH UNTIL THE ENGINES RPMS HIT PAST 3000.  THERE HAS BEEN ONE INJURY INVOLVING A SLIGHT CASE OF WHIPLASH AFTER THE ENGINE SOMEHOW REVVED UP PAST 5000 AND THEN CAUGHT.  (THE GAS WAS PRESSED DOWN AND EVEN AFTER THE GAS WAS RELEASED THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV UP AND WHEN IT HIT AROUND 5500 RPM THE TRANSMISSION CAUGHT MAKING IT FEEL LIKE I GOT BANGED BY ANOTHER CAR GOING 15+ MPH) NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE HONDA CLAIMS THAT IF THEY CANT DUPLICATE IT ON THEIR TEST DRIVE AROUND THE AREA, THEY WILL NOT REPLACE OR FIX THE PROBLEM (HONDA IS VERY POOR AT DUPLICATING THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE FAILURE HAPPENS)  THE FAILURE HAPPENS IN THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:  1.  WHEN YOU ARE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC REQUIRING YOU TO STOP AND GO CONSTANTLY  2.  ENTERING SHORT ON RAMPS REQUIRING THE CAR TO DOWNSHIFT  3.

THIS AFFECTS MILLIONS OF HONDAS AND IS A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW. *AK    THE OIL FILTER IS LOCATED DIRECTLY OVER A FLEXIBLE, WOVEN-METAL HOSE THAT IS PART OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. THE HOSE IS POROUS.    WHEN THE FILTER IS CHANGED, THE HOSE -- WHICH IS OFTEN EXTREMELY HOT WHEN ONE PULLS INTO A SERVICE STATION FOR AN OIL CHANGE -- MUST BE COVERED WITH A LEAK-PROOF MATERIAL SO THAT OIL DOESN'T DRIP ONTO THE FLEXIBLE HOSE. IF OIL GETS INTO THE WOVEN METAL OF THE HOSE, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT -- THE ONLY PRACTICAL OPTION IS TO LET IT BURN/BAKE OUT.     MANY NEW HONDA OWNERS EXPERIENCE A STRONG OIL ODOR AFTER GETTING THEIR OIL CHANGED FOR THE FIRST TIME -- THIS IS THE SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM. ANYONE EXPERIENCING SUCH AN ODOR IS AT RISK OF FIRE, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OIL DRIPPED ONTO THAT HOSE. MY MECHANIC CLEANED OFF THE EXCESS OIL WITH A RAG, BUT SOME ODOR OF BURNING OIL REMAINED FOR MORE THAN 1,000 MILES.    HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND ADVISES ITS SERVICE TECHS TO COVER THE HOSE WHEN THEY CHANGE THE FILTER. BUT THIS IS NOT KNOWN OUTSIDE OF THE HONDA COMMUNITY, SO PEOPLE WHO CHANGE THEIR OWN OIL, OIL-CHANGER CHAINS AND LOCAL GARAGES GENERALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. (CONSUMERS THEN THINK THAT THEY GOT POOR SERVICE FROM THE NON-HONDA GARAGE, WHICH ENCOURAGES THEM TO BRING THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP THE NEXT TIME AND PAY HIGH RATES FOR OIL CHANGES.)    HONDA OWNERS WHOSE CARS HAVE THIS DESIGN CAN AVOID THE PROBLEM BY HAVING THE PIPE COVERED DURING THE OIL CHANGE -- BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE AREA WHEN CHANGING YOUR OWN OIL.     HONDA COULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY INSTALLING AN ALUMINUM SHEATH OVER THE FLEXIBLE PIPE TO PROTECT IT AGAINST DRIPPING OIL. IF OIL FELL ON THE SHEATH, IT COULD STILL SMELL FOR A WHILE, BUT THE RISK OF FIRE WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED.      THANK YOU",

THE CAR HAD ONLY 12,000 MILES AND HAD  ALL THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED AS RECOMMENDED BY HONDA.  IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE OWNED A HONDA FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND HAVE DRIVEN A STICK SHIFT FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.  I AM VERY WELL AWARE OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE PEDALS.  ALSO, THE FLOOR MAT WAS ATTACHED TO ITS PIN NEAR THE FRONT OF THE SEAT SO IT DID NOT IMPEDE MY USE OF THE PEDALS.  I HAD THE IDLE GO ABSOLUTELY NUTS, ALMOST RED LINE, AFTER HAVING PARKED THE CAR FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN RESTARTING THE CAR.  THIS HAPPENED 3 TIMES OVER ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  THE FIRST TWO TIMES, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD.  LUCKILY, NO ONE OR ANY PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED.  I HAD BOTH CROWN HONDA OF CHAPEL HILL, NC AND FLOW HONDA OF WINSTON-SALEM, NC CHECK THE CAR OUT.  IN FACT, FLOW HAD THE CAR 3 WEEKS AFTER THE 3RD INCIDENT.  NEITHER DEALER SAID THEY FOUND A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.    I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR ALTHOUGH I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS CAR WILL BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WHO WILL NOT BE TOLD OF THE PROBLEM I HAVE EXPERIENCED.  I FEEL THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS AND SOMEONE MAY HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE.  I HOPE YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THE INTERNET TO FIND IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  HONDA SAYS THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS AN EASY OR HARD FIX.  I DO BELIEVE THIS CAR HAS A MAJOR PROBLEM.

IT STATED THAT IF THERE WAS A CELL PHONE, A LAP TOP COMPUTER, AN INVERTER (USED TO PUG ELECTRICAL ITEMS INTO THE CARS CIGARETTE LIGHTER) ANY ONE OF THESE MIGHT TRIP THE SRS WARNING LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.  THIS IS BECAUSE ANY OF THESE COMMONLY USED ELECTRONIC DEVICES MIGHT REACT WITH THE ACCORDS AIR BAG SENSORS AND CAUSE THE SRS LIGHT TO COME ON.  NOBODY KNEW FOR CERTAIN IF THE AIR BAGS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK IF THE SRS LIGHT WERE ON.  THUS COMMON EVERDAY TOOLS SUCH AS A CELL PHONE OR LAP TOP COMPUTER OR PROTABLE TV CAN SURELY DISRUPT THE ACCORDS AIR BAG SYSTEM AND POSSIBLY SHUT IT DOWN.  FURTHER, BECAUSE HONDA'S DEALERS WILL CHARGE A SERVICE FEE TO SHUT OFF THE SRS LIGHT, MANY AMERICAN CELL PHONE AND LAP TOP USERS WILL NOT TAKE THE TIME AND EXPENSE TO HAVE THE ANNOYING SRS LIGHT SHUT OFF.  THUS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MAY BE DRIVING 2001 AND 2002 ACCORDS WITHOUT AIR BAG PROTECTION.*AK",

TIRE FAILED 4 WEEKS AGO (5/24/02) WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES ON IT.  DEALER CLAIMS IT WAS DUE TO ROAD HAZARD.  THE TIRE FAILED IN A PARKING LOT AT LESS THAN 10 MPH.  THERE WERE NO ROAD HAZARDS IN SIGHT.  THE DEALER WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRE.  I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER MICHELIN TIRE TO MATCH THE OTHER TIRES.  THE REPLACEMENT TIRE THEY SOLD TO ME WAS MANUFACTURED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ORIGINAL TIRE--MAKING IT 40 MONTHS OLD AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  I THINK IT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL THAT MICHELIN CAN SELL TIRES THAT ARE 3 1/2 YEARS OLD AS NEW TIRES.   ARE THERE ANY REGULATIONS IN PLACE THAT PREVENT TIRE MANUFACTURERS FROM SELLING STOCK AS \"NEW\" WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED 2.5 - 3.5 YEARS EARLIER?

THEN AT AROUND 28K MILES, IT STARTED SHUDDERING AND SLIPPING ON DOWNSHIFTS BETWEEN 35-45MPH.  I THEN TOOK IT TO RIGHT HONDA IN SCOTTSDALE, AND THEY THEN FLUSHED THE LINEAR SOLENOID, AND WHEN I GOT IT BACK, IT WAS STILL WAS DOING IT.  THEY THEN REPLACED THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION, AND IT CAME BACK WITH A THUMPING NOISE WHEN IN PARK OR N.  THEY THEN REPLACED IT A SECOND TIME.  IT IS SHIFTING BETTER, BUT THE CAR HAS NOT AS MUCH PICKUP AND IS STILL MAKING THE METAL TO METAL NOISE, AFTER OVER $6,000 IN WARRANTY REPAIRS!  IT ALSO LURCHES THROUGH GEARS SOMETIMES, AND IS NOT AS SMOOTH AS IT WAS WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM, AND THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE QUITE A FEW TRANSMISSIONS.  I FIRST SPOKE WITH ANGIE WILLIAMS AT HONDA CORPORATE, AND SHE WOULD NOT HELP NOR LET ME SPEAK TO HER SUPERVISOR, RICK THOMAS.  I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO RICK THOMAS, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT BUY THE CAR BACK, NOR WAS I GOING TO GET ANY HELP FROM HIM.  I THEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO HIS SUPERVISOR, AND HE WOULD NOT LET ME SPEAK WITH RON GARNER.  THE RECEPTIONIST THEN LIED TO ME AND SAID THAT RICK GARNER DOESN\u0012T HAVE VOICEMAIL, I CAUGHT HER IN THE LIE.  UNDER MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY ACT, THEY HAVE HAD SUFFICIENT TIMES TO TRY AND REPAIR THIS VEHICLE!  I HAVE FOUND THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM, AS ALMOST EVERYONE WITH A V6 AUTOMATIC ACCORD SEEMS TO NOTICE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION!  THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM SUGGESTED I FILE A REPORT WITH THE BBB, SINCE THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS! I DID NOT PAY TO LEASE A $28,000 CAR, AND BE GIVEN A CHEAP RENTAL TO DRIVE AROUND IN FOR A MONTH.  HOW AM I GOING TO EVER SELL THIS CAR WITH A REPAIR RECORD LIKE THIS?
