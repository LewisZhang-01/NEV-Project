        "summary": "ON THE MORNING OF 11/20/17 I AWOKE TO THE SOUND OF ELECTRICAL ARCING. I TURNED THE MAIN BREAKER OFF, GOT A FLASH LIGHT AND A SCREW DRIVER AND TOOK  PANEL COVER OFF. THEN I TURNED THE MAIN BREAKER BACK ON AND SAW THAT THE 3RD BREAKER FROM THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WAS ARCING IN THE BOX WHICH I THEN TOOK MY PHONE AND SNAPPED A VIDEO OF THE ARCING. AFTER I PULLED OUT THE BREAKER I COULD SEE WHERE THE TOP OF IT WAS BROKEN.BUT THE FACT WAS I COULD NOW SEE THAT THE BREAKER THAT I REMOVED WAS INTENTIONALLY BROKEN AT THE FACTORY TO INSTALL IT ON THAT SIDE OF THE PANEL BOX WHERE THE TABS OF THE PANEL WERE MADE TO KEEP THAT BREAKER FROM BEING USED. NOT ONLY WAS PART OF THE SHELL TO THE BREAKER BROKEN BUT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CLIP IN THE BREAKER THAT KEEPS PRESSURE ON THE SOCKET OF THE BREAKER ONTO THE TAB OF THE PANEL. THE ALTERING OF THE BREAKER COMPROMISED THE CONNECTION TO THE PANEL WHICH I BELIEVE AFTER TIME GAVE IT THE CHANCE TO START ARCING. ANOTHER GUY ON THE FORUM FROM INDIANA THAT HAS A BERKSHIRE COACH, BUT IT'S A 2015 PULLED OUT HIS BREAKER FOR THE SAME CIRCUITS, IT WAS BROKEN OUT JUST LIKE MINE WAS ALTHOUGH HIS STILL HAD THE SPRING TO KEEP PRESSURE ON THE TABS OF THE PANEL.SO NOW I ASK MYSELF HERE'S 2 BERKSHIRE COACHES BUILT A YEAR APART WITH THE SAME EXACT BROKEN BREAKER?  THERE IS A RECALL17V-799 FOR 16 - 18 BERKSHIRES FOR THIS EXACT PRACTICE. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO GO MUCH FURTHER AS MY COACH IS A 2014 , AND THE OTHER GENTLEMEN'S IS A 2015. SEEMS LIKE IT WAS FOREST RIVERS COMMON PRACTICE TO USE INCORRECT BREAKERS IN BERKSHIRES. I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS RECALL EXPANDED TO 2012 AND MAYBE EVEN SOME OF THEIR OTHER MODELS LIKE CHARLSTONS AND LEGACYS  AS WELL BEFORE A FIRE TAKES SOMEONES LIFE. I DO HAVE A VIDEO OF THE BREAKER IN THE PANEL ARCING ON THAT MORNING BUT CANNOT SEEM TO LOAD IT ON HERE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO VIEW IT SEND ME AN EMAIL AND I WILL FORWARD IT TO YOU.",
