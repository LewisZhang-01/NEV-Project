I heard and felt a pop and then steering wheel was easily turned again. I barely missed the vehicle in front of me but I did hit the curb and a bicycle a pedestrian was holding next to him on sidewalk. He was able to jump out of the way and was fortunately unharmed. I stopped my vehicle and parked immediately. I called my husband and he came to get the vehicle and I drove his home. He had no problems driving vehicle home and power steering was working as normal but once he was close to pulling into the driveway, a warning message on dash read \"service power steering now\".... there were no warning of this problem what so ever and just suddenly happened. Very dangerous and I have read many many others have had same issue with exact make and model of 2010 mercury milan. Please add this issue with power steering to recall list so others don't get hurt. I hurt my neck & wrist when I hit that curb and bicycle. I also had to pay for bicycle I hit.. A code reader was put onto car the next day and gave codes C-1963 and C-1277 if that helps with the recall. Thank you for your time and concern in this matter and I apologize for any inconvenience.",

I had taken the vehicle to Earnhardt Ford in Chandler, AZ twice prior to this incident and worked with service advisor Gina prior to this incident because the power steering had also stopped working previously but would start working again a few moments after turning on the ignition so Earnhardt Ford was unable to reproduce the issue. After the power steering failed in April 2014, I drove the car to San tan Ford in the gilbert, az area. After a few days, I was quoted a repair price of $7,000 to replace the steering rack entirely. I was told there was no way to repair individual parts in the rack and the whole thing had to be replaced. I had purchased the vehicle as a certified pre-owned car from Sanderson Ford of Glendale, AZ in October of 2012 with roughly 50,000 miles on it. By the time of the incident in April of 2014, the car had roughly 98,000 miles on it and San Tan Ford refused to repair the car under warranty. When I contacted my salesman who sold me the car at Sanderson, he said I that I should buy a pickup truck instead since that might be more reliable, and that was all he had to say about the situation. I sold the Mercury Milan on April 28 of 2014 and traded it in for another vehicle at Van Chevrolet of Scottsdale, AZ since the repair costs closely matched the value of the Milan even if it didn\u2019t need repairs. In 2015, a recall was announced related to a power steering fault in mercury Milan\u2019s. I strongly believe my vehicle was affected by this recall.",

HE TOLD ME IT COULD BE THAT THE PART IS A USED ONE, SO I ORDERED A NEW ABS PUMP FROM PARTS MAVEN FORD.  AFTER INSTALLING THE NEW PART, THE MECHANIC HAD THE SAME ISSUES WITH IT AS WELL.  THE MECHANIC IS NOT ABLE TO CLEAR OR RESET ALL CODES FOR THE ELECTRIC STABILIZER, ABS, AND BRAKE LIGHTS AND ADEQUATELY CALIBRATE THE BRAKES.  IT LEFT THE BRAKE VERY SOFT ON THE PEDAL, AND IT REQUIRED PRESSING THE BRAKE HARD TO THE FLOOR TO BRING THE CAR TO A FULL STOP.

IT TAKES LONGER TO STOP, AND IT REQUIRES PRESSING HARD ON THE BRAKE AND LONGER DISTANCE TO COME TO A FULL STOP.

HE COULD HAVE INJURED HIMSELF OR DIED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM,  HE WAS ABLE TO, WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY, GET THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD. HE WAS VERY LUCKY!! THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THE VEHICLE HAD 2 LIGHTS THAT DISPLAYED: 1. SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW AND 2. SERVICE ADVANCETRAC. IT IS STILL DISPLAYING ON THE DASH AND THERE IS NO POWER STEERING, THEREFORE THE VEHICLE CAN NOT BE DRIVEN.. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR!! THIS CAR IS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD AND IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE 2011 MILAN HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THE 2010 HAS THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM (ELECTRIC POWER STEERING) AS THE 2011,  BUT IT WAS NOT RECALLED. HOW CAN THAT BE?? IS IT LESS OF A SAFETY ISSUE BASED ONLY ON THE YEAR?

IT WAS IN THE SHOP FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AS NO REASON FOR THE PROBLEM COULD BE   DETERMINED. EVENTUALLY THEY CONTACTED FORD FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM.

WHILE IT HAS ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS SINCE THE REPAIR, THE BRAKE PERFORMANCE IS MUCH IMPROVED. I CHECKED ONLINE AND SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH FORD FUSIONS AND MERCURY MILANS HAVING BRAKE FAILURE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT COULD RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.

THE PROBLEM EVENTUALLY CORRECTS ITSELF, BUT IT TAKES AT LEAST A FEW HOURS AND SOMETIMES UP TO A DAY OR MORE. THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ALL ANY DRIVING CONDITION (CITY STREET, HIGHWAY, DRIVEWAY, ETC...), AND AT ANY SPEED (AS LOW AS 5 MPH).    I RECENTLY READ THAT 2007-2009 MODELS WERE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR THE EXACT SAME REASON, AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 2010 MODEL WAS ADDED TO THE LIST BECAUSE I FEEL VERY UN-SAFE DRIVING MY CAR SOMETIMES, AND THE ABS SYSTEM IS SUCH A VITAL COMPONENT TO A SAFE DRIVE.     ALSO, AFTER READING THE NEXT PAGE, THE MOST RECENT INSTANCE HAPPENED JUST YESTERDAY (5/21/17), BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN JANUARY OF 2011. MY MECHANIC HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE IT, SO HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT, BUT FROM WHAT I'VE READ, THE HYDRAULIC BRAKE CONTROLLER IS THE FAULTY PART.

THIS IS ONLY AN ISSUE AT NIGHT- DURING THE DAY THE BRAKE LIGHTS FUNCTION NORMALLY. BASED ON INTERNET FORUMS AT EDMUNDS AND CONSUMER REPORTS, AMONG OTHERS, I HAVE FOUND AT LEAST 10 OTHER INSTANCES OF THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH 2010 MERCURY MILANS, MOST WITH LOW MILEAGE: E.G.

MY CAR HAS ONLY 15,000 MILES ON IT. THIS CLEARLY APPEARS TO BE A FACTORY WIRING DEFECT, AND ONE THAT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS WHEN THE CAR IS PURCHASED (WE ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT WHEN SOMEONE WE KNEW WAS FOLLOWING OUR CAR AT NIGHT, THREE MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE OF THE CAR). THE FIX, ACCORDING TO FORD, IS TO REPLACE BOTH TAIL LIGHTS, AT A COST OF $1000. FORD REFUSES TO HELP PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OR ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECT. GIVEN THE OBVIOUS SAFETY IMPLICATIONS OF CONTINUOUSLY ACTIVE BRAKE LIGHTS, THE DOCUMENTED RECORD OF THE DEFECT, AND THE NON-OBVIOUS NATURE OF THE PROBLEM (MANY PEOPLE MAY BE DRIVING AROUND WITH THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT REALIZING IT), NHTSA NEEDS TO PRESS FORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECT AND PERFORM A RECALL.  *TR",

I BOUGHT IT COUPLE MONTHS AGO, LESS THAN 30K MILES... I'M DRIVING AND ACCELERATING STOPPED WORKING, MY CAR SLOWED DOWN, I CLICKED THE HAZARDS ON REAL QUICK AND DRIFTED AS FAR OVER AS I COULD. POLICE HAD TO PUT FLARES OUT UNTIL TOW TRUCK CAME. TOW TRUCK GOT THERE AND AFTER WE MADE IT TO FORD-MERCURY, THE CAR STARTED AND \"ACTED\"  JUST FINE. THE TOW DRIVER SUGGESTED IT HAD BEEN BAD GAS AND MAY NEED INJECTION CLEANER. I DECIDED TO DRIVE IT HOME AFTER ADDING HI-TEST GAS AND INJ CLEANER, AND IT WAS ALL GOOD. UNTIL TODAY.(3 DAYS LATER). I STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND CAR IDLED DOWN TIL IT CUT OFF. THE MPG LED MONITOR STARTED DROPPING (JUST LIKE IT DID FIRST TIME) IT WENT FROM GETTING 15 MPG TO 5 MPG IN THE MATTER OF 2 MINUTES WHILE JUST IDLING. AS IF THE GAS WAS DUMPING THRU LINES. ALSO THE IDLE BECAME SO ERRATIC IT WOULD GO UP THEN DROP DOWN, I MADE IT WHERE I NEEDED BUT LEFT THE CAR, AND TOOK SPOUSES CAR. I TOOK A VIDEO OF THE DASH THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED IT SHOWS  ORANGE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON, THE MPG DROPPED FROM 13MPG TO 2.2MPG AND THE IDLE RPM WOULD GO UP AND DOWN, NO MATTER WHETHER YOU PUSHED GAS OR NOT. GAS PEDAL STILL FELT NORMAL UNDER FOOT, SO NOT THE PEDAL. CAR STILL RAN, JUST WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE, (HAD DOG AND NEEDED AC UNTIL TOW CAME) I HOPE THERE'S A FIX FOR THIS. FROM WHAT I'M SEEING, EVEN THE DEALER MECHANICS CAN'T DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE. WILL BE CHECKING HERE TO SEE IF ANY NEW HELP OR ADVICE IS AVAILABLE. *TR",

THEY CLEANED THE THROTTLE BODY (PARTS ARE BACK ORDERED TILL 9/24/13) & SENT ME ON MY WAY HOPING THAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. IT DID NOT, SO I STOPPED AT THE VERY NEXT TOWN AFTER IT HAPPENED AGAIN & LEFT MY MERCURY MILAN WITH A FORD DEALERSHIP.

I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN DRIVING WITH THE P0456 CODE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AND IT HAD NEVER AFFECTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE, SO I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD DO IT NOW.
