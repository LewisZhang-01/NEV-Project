        "summary": "AKA ZX600G2 I STARTED MY MOTORCYCLE AND LET IT WARM UP FOR 1-2 MINUTES (NORMAL STARTING PROCEDURE).  I WAS JUST ABOUT TO RIDE AWAY WHEN I SMELLED WOOD BURNING.  I LOOKED DOWN TO SEE SMOKE BILLOWING OUT FROM UNDER THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY MOTORCYCLE.  I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, YET THE SMOKE CONTINUED FOR 2 MINUTES.  I REMOVED THE RIGHT LOWER BODY PANEL TO REVEAL A 10 MM SMOLDERING PIECE OF WOOD (OR TREE BARK) ON THE LOWER EXHAUST HEADERS.  FORTUNATELY, THE MOTORCYCLE'S GASOLINE DID NOT IGNITE.  THIS MOTORCYCLE HAS AN IN-LINE FOUR CYLINDER ARRANGEMENT.  THE EXHAUST PIPES EXIT THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE AND CURVE DOWN (BEHIND THE FRONT TIRE) WHERE THEY CONVERGE UNDER THE ENGINE TO FORM A 4 INTO 1 EXHAUST.  THERE IS ENOUGH OF A GAP BETWEEN THE FRONT OF THE FOUR EXHUAST PIPES TO ALLOW ROAD DEBRIS (KICKED UP BY THE FRONT TIRE) TO BE DEPOSITED ON THE PARALLEL HORIZONTAL SECTIONS OF THE EXHAUST PIPES.  THE GAP BETWEEN THE HORIZONTAL SECTIONS IS TOO NARROW TO ALLOW ROAD DEBRIS TO FALL AWAY.  THUS A FIRE TRAP EXISTS.  THIS COULD BE REPEATED BY RIDING THE MOTORCYCLE AT NORMAL SPEEDS OVER DRY WOOD CHIPS.  THE SPACING BETWEEN THE LOWER, HORIZONTAL PORTIONS OF THE EXHAUST PIPES NEEDS TO BE GREATER.  SEVERAL OTHER MOTORCYCLE MODELS AND MAKES HAVE THIS DESIGN FLAW.  I HAVE DESIGNED AND IMPLIMENTED A MESS ALUMINUM GRILLE WHICH MOUNTS IN FRONT OF THE EXHAUST PIPES TO BLOCK ROAD DEBRIS FOM BEING DEPOSITED ON THE EXHAUST PIPES.  I SENT A LETTER TO KAWASAKI MOTORS CORP USA, PO BOX 25252, SANTA ANA, CA 92799-5252 WITHOUT REPLY.  SINCERELY, DR. MARK HOM, MD.",
