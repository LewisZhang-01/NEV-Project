VEHICLE WAS PARKED FOR 15 MINUTES WITH NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF TROUBLE OTHER THAN EXTREMELY HOT WHEELS.  VEHICLE WAS RESTARTED AND UPON BEING SET INTO MOTION THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS A COMPLETE LOSS OF BRAKING ABILITY.  VEHICLE NARROWLY MISSED PEDESTRIANS AND PERSONAL PROPERTY BEFORE BEING STOPPED WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO SERVICE CENTER AND PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AS STATED ABOVE.  SERVICE CENTER REPLACED 1 BRAKE CALIPER, 2 BRAKE LINES, 4 WHEEL BEARINGS, 2 ROTORS, 1 ABS SENSOR, AND FLUSHED AND FILLED WITH DOT 4 FLUID.  BRAKE LOCKUP HAS NOW OCCURRED 3 TIMES WITH THIS ONE BEING THE ONLY DANGEROUS INSTANCE.  SPEAKING WITH THE MANUFACTURER I WAS INFORMED THAT \"THIS VEHICLE WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL\" NUMEROUS TIMES.  I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY RECALL UNTIL BEING TOLD BY THE MANUFACTURER THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED BUT UPON RESEARCHING IT I DISCOVERED WHY.  THE CONDITIONS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.  VEHICLE IS BEING TOWED TO SERVICE CENTER AGAIN THIS WEEK TO RESOLVE LOCKED BRAKES BEFORE CAUSING ADDITIONAL DAMAGE. *TR",
