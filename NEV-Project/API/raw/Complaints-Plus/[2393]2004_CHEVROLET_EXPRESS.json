IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE IN SOME WAY.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON OUR VAN LIVED UP TO THEIR 40K WARRANTY AND WE REPLACED WITH THESE GRABBER HTS TIRES AT 39747 MILES.  OUR DRIVING HABITS ARE CONSERVATIVE AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE TIRES AHEAD OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD.  THE TREAD WAS SO BAD ON THESE GRABBER HTS TIRES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO DRIVE OUR VAN ON SNOWY ROADS DURING THIS PAST WINTER.  WE ALSO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HYDROPLANING ON THE EXPRESSWAY WHEN WE DROVE THE VAN THROUGH HEAVY RAINS THIS PAST WEEKEND WHEN WE DROPPED OFF OUR DAUGHTER AT COLLEGE.  WE BELIEVE THESE TIRES ARE HAZARDOUS AND THAT AN INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE INITIATED.  IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE WOULD ONLY GET 25K MILES OUT OF A 60K TIRES.  WE FEEL CHEATED AND REALLY DO NOT WANT ANOTHER SET OF GENERAL TIRES ON A PRO-RATA BASIS.    *TR",
