The car stopped and would not move on the entrance ramp to a busy highway. I called 911 because I was almost hit multiple times as I could not move the car. FDOT came to assist and saw that I could not depress the break, remove the emergency break, or get the car to move. After a few minutes we turned the car off and it started back up with no problem. The vehicle had to be towed to the dealer on 3/30/2022. Upon searching on the internet, I saw that this is not a new issue. I could have been killed yesterday while on the phone with 911 on the on ramp to the highway with vehicles approaching at a very high rate of speed and having to slam on their breaks and swerve off the road to avoid hitting me.",

It sounds exactly like the below: \u201cWhile driving, the vehicle shifts into Neutral, the transmission indicator comes and DTC P0657 (actuator supply voltage circuit/open) is stored. The driver will not be able to select any other gear until the vehicle is turned off and restarted. Update the PGM-FI [programmed fuel injection] software and the TCM software, clear any DTCs [diagnostic trouble codes], and do the PCM [powertrain control module] idle learn procedure.\u201d - TSB 15-034  Additionally, May 23, 2021 we had an experience where the same MDX decelerated as we merged into traffic at I-30 and I-820 in Ft. Worth. I let off the accelerator going 60-70 MPH and then stepped on the accelerator to complete my merge and there was no power. Speed dropped to around 20 almost instantly.

WOMEN SHOULD HAVE SAFE SEATBELTS, TOO.    WOMEN (50% OF POPULATION) SHOULD BE PROVIDED JUST AS SAFE SEATBELTS AS MEN (50% OF POPULATION) ' BUT WE ARE NOT.  WE ARE OF SHORTER STATURE, SO CURRENT SEATBELTS COME ACROSS OUR BODY AT A HIGHER ANGLE AND THEREFORE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE NECK RATHER THAN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SHOULDER.  THE SEATBELT ADJUSTMENT NEEDS TO COME DOWN ON THE SIDE POST ANOTHER 2 INCHES TO MAKE IT SAFE ENOUGH FOR WOMEN (AT ALL ADJUSTABLE ATTACH POINTS).    1.OUR SEAT IS FARTHER FORWARD, SO WE CAN REACH THE BRAKE PEDDLE.  THIS CAUSES A SHARPER ANGLE WHICH MAKES THE SEATBELT CUT INTO OUR LEFT SIDE OF THE NECK INSTEAD OF ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF OUR SHOULDER.  2.WE SIT LOWER BECAUSE OF OUR SHORTER HEIGHT, CAUSING A SHARPER ANGLE WHICH THEN MAKES THE SEATBELT CUT INTO OUR NECK.  WITH SHORTER LEGS, WE DON'T WANT OUR FEET TO DANGLE AND BECOME TIRED WHILE DRIVING.  OUR SHORTER STATURE MAKES THE SEATBELT UNSAFE (AND UNFAIR).    1.THE ANNOYING CUT INTO OUR NECK MAKES US WANT TO PLACE THE SHOULDER HARNESS UNDER OUT ARM = EXTREMELY UNSAFE.    2.THE NECK PAIN DISTRACTS US FROM SAFE DRIVING INSTEAD OF HAVING FULL ATTENTION ON THE ROAD.    3.IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, THE MISPLACEMENT OF THE SEATBELT AGAINST OUR NECK MAKES INJURIES TO THE NECK MORE LIKELY.      RECOMMEND YOU ADD MORE WOMEN DRIVERS TO YOUR AUTOMOBILE SAFETY STANDARDS COMMITTEE.  WOMEN WITH THEIR SHORTER HEIGHT SHOULD HAVE JUST AS MUCH PROTECTION AS MEN.",
