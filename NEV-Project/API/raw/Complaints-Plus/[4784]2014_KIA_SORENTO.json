Due to the continuous oil burning issue that Kia refuses to fix or address eventhough I have agreed to pay, the mechanic now says there's a knock sensor issue which makes it unsafe to drive. I have reached out to Kia for months now, with still no resolution in sight..

My senior citizen 2 time cancer survivor mom attempted to drive my car to return it to me in Vegas when an hour out of Tucson it stalled as oil light came on. Previously Royal Kia had promised to put extra oil in car so if this happened again, oil could be put in, no oil was in car. Everyone associated with Kia in this case has consistently been inconsistent not fulfilling promises made, plus me and my family just continued to be in convenience by Kia. Demanding a 1000 mileage a month oil consumption test during a pandemic when I work in North Vegas before service is ridulous, unrealistic, and unsafe.  Transparency and assistance would be appreciated,  but due to Kia's prior action and incompetence, I'm not hopeful. When calling, usually businesses leave a voice-mail, I have no such record from you.  Not a satisfied customer.  Pics of docs at https://photos.app.goo.gl/YauPabwvPoXzs7z87",

Then I saw smoke coming from the hood of my car. So I put my emergency flashers on and got out within seconds of getting out the smoke turned to flames so I called 911.  Entire front of my car was in flames and a couple small explosions happend I believe the first one was the air bags but the second sent my hood flying upwards. My entire inside of the car was chard by the time the fire rescue showed up. There was a line of traffic behind me that stretched close to a mile since it was during traffic night. I didn\u2019t have enough time to pull the car over safely without the risks of being inside the car while it had fully ignited. The fire men had to get people and cars away from my car. I don\u2019t know what failed or what happens but the fire started from under the hood. The car is pretty badly burnt so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to examine anything. It is a total loss. Upon googling I\u2019ve noticed a few more reports of Kia 2014 Sorentos catching fire. I don\u2019t know which component caused it so I can\u2019t say if it had been examined at all. It also happens extremely fast and I didn\u2019t have any warning as to a fire breaking out. If I had stayed in the car to drive it to a safe clearing I would have been caught in the blaze. The only light that came on was tier pressure, which had come on a few days prior. No other warning lights came on. Not even during when the smoke appeared. The only thing that warned me was a strange odor right before I saw the smoke.",

The instrument panel showed that the low beams were still on.  No warning of any type of malfunction was indicated or shown. I have not contacted KIA about the problem yet, but I am sure they are aware of the problem. I have read multiple blogs online and this appears to be a common problem, and has been for a long time, with multiple KIA models and generations.    My suspicions are the problem may be in either the multi-position switch, airbag clock spring, or cable harness, or any combination of the three.  It is my understanding the fuses and relays for the lights are side related ( all either on LH or RH).  I checked fuses and relays even though I find it hard to believe both sides would go bad at the same time, and all were good.  There is a long history of this electrical problem in these vehicles that needs to be found and fixed before someone needlessly loses their life.  Who knows, maybe someone has already been killed.  Lights go out, they go off the road and hit a tree.  The instruments would show the headlights are on, but they were not.  Now its hard to prove with the head lights totally destroyed.",

For example, when we called to make an appointment for one recall notice, we were told that no action was needed unless we heard a loud banging noise coming from the engine.  We stated that we heard weird noises but not a loud banging.  We were told that the dealership cannot do repairs unless we show evidence of the banging.  Also, there have been electrical problems with the car since we bought it \u2013 the buttons malfunction, the airbag light is always on, etc.  This was not regarded as evidence of need for repairs.  For another recall notice, we were told that the repairs could not be completed because they didn't have the parts.    We received the Safety Recall Number 21V331 on Friday July 17 and have tried repeatedly to contact Kia of Cerritos in order to make an appointment for repairs.   The dealership does not answer their phones in the service department. At 2:30 July 19, I got through to someone in the service department.  He said he would make an appointment to complete recall repairs but instead put us on hold and transferred us to a full voicemail box.  We are very worried about the safety of our Kia Sorrento.

I have studied, reviewed, read and worked to try and ensure we got the best possible light and there simply is a poor electrical wiring design for this specific vehicle.  I adjusted the Headlights UP as far as I could and it still made no difference at all in my viewing field.  How could the NHSTA allow KIA to get away with coming to market w/ these POOR Headlights?  We have to drive around at night now w/ the High Beams On at all times in order to see properly.  That is unacceptable!     The Driver should not have to purchase an LED Bright Light Kit and have to Re-Wire the vehicle because of being provided a lightning system that doesn't work and is an extreme danger.   KIA should have to recall every single one of these vehicles and provide \" sufficient \" lighting that meets SAFETY protocols for headlights and the field that is to be illuminated.  How is nobody aware of this and why hasn't it been addressed?  It's outrageous and I've never heard of any vehicle having to use High Beams to see driving down a straight road let alone in heavy traffic and or or on a winding road.  Is anyone listening and or are Safety Standards now a thing of the past.  Shame on KIA, they know of the problem and have done NOTHING to correct it.      KIA Brake Speed Sensors fail routinely and should also be a RECALLED Item.  We've had all of the  Brake Speed Sensors  fail on the vehicle and now we've had to pay out of our pocket to replace these faulty items.  It's ridiculous....they were covered under warranty until 60k but that is NOT sufficient!  There has been about three (3) separate recalls for this vehicle relating to brake issues.",

A few mths ago vehicle would start up fine on 1st drive of the day but after 1st stop of the day (as little as 5 mins!)vehicle would not even attempt to start up again! This happened multiple times & I found myself stranded in an essentially still new vehicle (note low miles for a 7 yr old vehicle)! All in all I replaced the above mentioned parts but problem continued so finally took it in to dealership for diagnosis, which they found no codes or problems! A service mgr mentioned that Nissan had similar problems (but they issued recalls unlike Kia!) where the frequencies would interact/interfere with those of neon stop lights??? Cars would simply shut down on the road/busy intersections--danger!!!

The vehicle was taken back to the dealer where it was diagnosed with the fuse box and power relay control was needing to be replaced. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but did not provide any assistance as a case was opened. The vehicle was not repaired due to the fact that the contact would be responsible for the repair cost. The approximate failure mileage was 126,000.",

AFTER GETTING 2 OIL CHANGES $140 IN ONE MONTH AND DRIVING FOR THE FIRST 1K MILES AFTER STARTING THE OIL TESTING, I WENT IN AT 8:30AM TO GET AN INSPECTION ON 3/15/21. I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP MY CAR, AND HAD TO WOUND UP GETTING A RENTAL CAR. ANOTHER $239 I DON'T HAVE. I THEN HAD TO PAY FOR LABOR AND FREON $286. AFTER ALL THE WAITING AND TROUBLE I WENT THROUGH, SUFFERING WITH NO AC IN FL, AND SPENDING A TOTAL OF $1,296; THEY TELL ME AFTER INSTALLING THE PART MY AC COMPRESSOR IS BAD AND IT WOULD COST $905. SO I STILL DON'T HAVE AC! AT THIS POINT, THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, I WOULD LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR RENTAL EXPENSES WHILE DOING THE OIL TESTING, FUTURE RENTAL/LOANER ACCOMMODATION BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WILL KEEP MY CAR AGAIN, AND ASSISTANCE WITH THE COMPRESSOR AND SENSORS. BEING I PAID FOR AN OVERPRICED HOSE, AND THE ENGINE IS FAILING. NOW SINCE LAST OIL TEST, GAS GAUGE DOES NOT MATCH ELECTRONIC RANGE READING. NOT SURE IF GAS IS FULL OR NOT. WHEN SEATBELT DINGS SPEED GAUGE JUMPS.",

I ALSO BROUGHT IT TO MEDVED KIA DEALERSHIP IN WHEAT RIDGE COLORADO FOR AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST, I BROUGHT IT IN EVERY 500 MILES TO CHECK THE OIL CONSUMPTION. AFTER 3000 MILES THE OIL WAS DOWN A TOTAL 2.5 QUARTS. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US THEY CONTACTED KIA HEADQUARTERS AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO UNTIL THERE IS A ENGINE FAILURE, BUT OUR CONCERN IS IF SOMEONE IS UNAWARE OF THE OIL CONSUMPTION (OR IF WE FORGET TO PUT OIL IN OUR CAR AT 500 MILES) ISSUE AND THEIR ENGINE SEIZE ON THE HIGHWAY THIS COULD PUT THEM AND OTHER VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAY IN A POTENTIAL DANGEROUS OR LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.        ADDITIONALLY, THE USER MANUAL STATES (PAGE 7 | 11) UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR OIL EVERY 7500 MILES, THE VEHICLE TAKE 5 QUARTS, SO IF WE WAITED FOR THE 7500 MILES THE ENGINE WOULD SEIZE OR EXPLODE.

ITS SCARY. I ALSO HAVE THE WORST GAS MILEAGE. I STARTED IFF AT 12 MILES. AFTER SERVICING, IT WENT DOWN TO 8MI PER GALLON. IF IT GETS TO 14MI AND I GET THE CAR SERVICED, IT IMMEDIATELY DROPS BACK DOWN. THERE ARE SERIOUS ELECTRICAL ISSUES WITH THESE SORENTOS. THIS IS A 2014 AND I JUST GOT A RECALL. THE RECALL  WORK WSS DONE AND I EXPERIENCED THE WHOKE ELECTRICAL CRAZINESS AGAIN WITH THE TRUNCK, LIGHTS, AND CLOCK. EVENTUALLY ALL THE LIGHTS EXCEPT ONE CAME ON. DEALERSHIP SWEARS IT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE. THEY AKSO HAVE NO ANSWER FOR THE CLOCK BEING 2 HOURS BEHIND EHEN THD CAR WAS RETURNED. THEY SSID THAT CHECKING THE HECU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHTS,  OR THE CLOCK. I SUSPECT NO RECALLS ON THE EKECTRICAL SYSTEM OR POOR MILEAGE WILL COME OUT UNTIL THE CAR IS 10 YEARX OLD. VEHICLE IS STATIONARY MOST OF THE TIME. I DO NOT DRIVE THAT MUCH",

SOME I HAVE PAID FOR, SOME COMPLIMENTARY BUT SUPER INCONVENIENT TO SAY THE LEAST.

THE FIRST ISSUE IS THE ELECTRICAL. IT FIRST STARTED BACK AROUND 40,000 MILES WHEN I TOOK MY KIA TO A KIA DEALERSHIP IN NAPERVILLE, IL AND THEY TOLD ME BOTH LOW BEAMS WERE OUT, SO THEY REPLACE THEM. EVER SINCE, I'VE BEEN REPLACING THESE BULBS EVERY 3-6 MONTHS BECAUSE THEY KEEP BLOWING OUT WHILE DRIVING AND IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO USE HIGH BEAMS, SO I'M DRIVING IN PITCH BLACK. NOW, JUST 3MONTHS AGO, BOTH OF MY BRAKE LIGHTS GO OUT, AT THE SAME TIME. THREE YEARS AGO MY BACK UP CAMERA STOPPED WORKING, AND HASN'T WORKED SINCE. AT 57K MILES MY ENGINE WAS RECALLED FOR ENGINE FAILURES, AD WITHIN THE LAST 6 MONTHS I'VE EXPERIENCED STALLING, STUTTERING, KNOCKING WHILE DRIVING ON HIGH WAYS, AT RED LIGHTS, IN TRAFFIC. FURTHERMORE, IN SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 MY ENGINE OIL WAS COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE ON THE DIP STICK WHEN I TOOK IT IN FOR A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE AT 99,664 MILES. ALSO, BACK AT 64,977 MILES DURING ROUTINE SERVICE, IT WAS LOW. WITH THESE CONCERNS, I TOOK MY KIA IN TODAY TO THE GERALD KIA NORTH AURORA, IL, THEY RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. THEY SAID THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY MY BULBS KEEP BURNING OUT. THE TECH MANAGER ALSO STATED THAT THE STALLING AND KNOCKING IN MY ENGINE IS BECAUSE MY ENGINE HAD NO OIL IN IT. HE CHECKED FOR LEAKS, AND DIDN'T FIND ANY LEAKS. MY LAST OIL CHANGE AT A JIFFY LUBE, THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING AT 99,664 MILES, IT WAS ALMOST DRY. AT TODAYS SERVICE, MILEAGE IS 102,554. THAT MEANS 5 QUARTS OF OIL BURNED UP IN 2,890 MILES OR MOST LIKELY WAY SOONER BECAUSE AFTER 1.5 MONTHS OF THE OIL CHANGE I STARTED EXPERIENCED STALLING, KNOCKING, STUTTERING IN THE ENGINE, SO THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AT ONLY 1000-1500 MILES.

PURCHASED IT SATURDAY AFTERNOON JUST PRIOR TO THE USED CAR DEALER CLOSING. AFTER PAPERWORK AND PLATES DONE, DROVE IT TOWARD HOME. ABOUT 4 MILES FROM DEALER (INTERSTATE HIGHWAY) SAW THE TEMPERATURE GUAGE CLIMBING INTO THE HOT AREA. NO OTHER ERRORS OR LIGHTS CAME ON. LET OFF ON GAS TO PULL OVER AND TEMP GUAGE CAME DOWN TO NORMAL. CONTINUED WITH CAUTION THINKING THIS WAS A FAULTY GUAGE OR SENDER UNIT.  LIMPED HOME SLOWLY. NOTICED GOING UP HILLS AND PULLING HARD TEMP WOULD CLIMB. LETTING OFF GAS TEMP WOULD DROP TO NORMAL. LONG STORY SHORT GOT THE CAR TO A VERY REPUTABLE AND EXPERIENCED GARAGE.  ENGINE COULDN'T BE REPAIRED ECONOMICALLY. DEALER DID OFFER MONEY BACK. AS MUCH AS I DIDN'T WANT TO, WOUND UP HAVING TO INSTALL ANOTHER USED LOW MILAGE V6 ENGINE.  DURING THE MONTH IN THE GARAGE I HAD DONE MUCH RESEARCH & DIGGING & TALKING OFTEN WITH THE VERY EXPERIENCED MECHANIC IN CHARGE OF THE JOB. COOLANT WAS LOW AND ALL BUT TWO OF THE HEAD BOLTS WERE MORE THAN FINGER TIGHT !! HOW THIS ENGINE WAS RUNNING WAS BEYOND ME, IT WAS! DURING ALL THIS RESEARCH I READ OF MANY HEAD GASKET PROBLEMS AND LEAKS HAD BEEN REPORTED. THE THING THAT WAS REALLY CONCERNING WAS THE NUMBER OF ENGINE FIRES THAT HAD NO REAL CAUSE REPORTED AFTERWARDS. MY CONCERN IS IF I HAD CONTINUED DRIVING THIS CAR HARD, COULD A LEAKY HEAD GASKET CAUSE A FIRE UNDER THE HOOD? I LEARNED FROM THE MECHANIC ALL THESE HEAD BOLTS STRIPPED THE THREADS FROM THE BLOCK. I ALSO LEARNED THERE IS ANOTHER 1.5 INCHES OF UNUSED THREADS INSIDE THE BLOCK!  MY SUSPICION IS KIA SKIMPED ON THE LENGTH OF ALL THESE HEAD BOLTS TO SAVE A BUCK PUTTING THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AT THE CUSTOMERS RISK.  IS MY SAFETY AT RISK?

IT TOOK 2 MONTHS TO GET MY CAR BACK, THEY DID PROVIDE A RENTAL. A MONTH LATER (JAN. 2019) I SMELLED GASOLINE VERY STRONG IN MY CAR.

I HAD TO CALL KIA CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO GET THIS CAR TOWED TO WARNER KIA. TURNS OUT THEY FORGOT TO REPLACE A BRACKET DURING THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT, NOT VERY SMART IN MY OPINION FOR SO CALLED CERTIFIED MECHANICS. I GOT IT BACK AGAIN FEB. 2019. NOW IT IS MARCH 2019, MY TRANSMISSION APPEARS TO BE SLIPPING, HESITATING TO PICK UP SPEED. I ALMOST GOT HIT BY A SEMI TRYING TO GET ONTO THE INTERSTATE BECAUSE CAR WOULD NOT GO FAST ENOUGH.

AFTER PLUGGING IT UP AND GETTING NO CODES I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER JUNE 2017 AND THEY INFORMED ME IT WAS NO BIG DEAL BUT IT WAS PART OF A RECALL FOR A SENSOR. HOWEVER, KIA HAD NOT PROVIDED THEM WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO FIX IT. IT'S NOW AUGUST 2018 AND I AM STILL WAITING.    ISSUE 2- AT APPROX 130K MILES MY STEERING CONTROLS FOR BLUETOOTH AND RADIO STOPPED WORKING. THE RADIO ITSELF WORKS, BUT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SEEK OR ADJUST VOLUME WITH STEERING CONTROLS THE VOICE COMMAND POPS UP.    ISSUE 3- AT APPROX 145K CRUISE CONTROL STOPPED WORKING. I CAN TURN IT ON AND SET SPEED, BUT IN LESS THAN A MILE IT DISENGAGES. I HAVE FOUND IF I TURN OFF THE ECO IT WORKS AS IT SHOULD.     ISSUE 4 I FOUND TODAY. AFTER GETTING A MESSAGE FROM A RANDOM STRANGER THROUGH MY ADVERTISED BUSINESS ON THE BACK WINDOW I WAS INFORMED THAT I HAVE NO BRAKE LIGHTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONE ON TOP (THIRD). I JUST REPLACED THEM IN JULY AFTER A RANDOM STRANGER TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE OUT. WHEN I GOT THE MESSAGE (AFTER MAKING MY 60 MILE COMMUTE TO WORK) I GRABBED A COWORKER TO COME OUT AND TROUBLESHOOT WITH ME. WE CHECKED FUSES AND THEY ARE FINE. THIRD LIGHT WORKS, TAIL LIGHTS WORK, TURN SIGNALS AND BACKUP LIGHTS WORK.

KMA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE DRIVE SHAFT OF AFFECTED VEHICLES MAY DEVELOP A CRACK IN THE AREA OF THE STUB AT THE WHEEL-END OF THE SHAFT. SHOULD THIS OCCUR, THE VEHICLE MAY LOSE POWER OR, IF THE DRIVER FAILS TO ENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE WHEN PARKED ON AN INCLINE, THE VEHICLE MAY ROLL. THE VEHICLES HAVING THIS CONDITION ARE THE 2014 MODEL YEAR SORENTO 2.4-LITER FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE (FWD) MODEL PRODUCED THROUGH MARCH 12, 2013.  I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE IN LATE MAY OF 2014 IT IS A 2.4 LITER FWD VEHICLE.  I ALSO WENT ONLINE TO CHECK FOR KNOWN RECALLS AND NOTHING CAME UP NOR WAS I EVER NOTIFIED.  I HAVE HAD NO ACCIDENTS OR OTHER ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.  KMA NEVER NOTIFIED ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE   RIGHT FRONT AXLE DRIVESHAFT WILL BE REPLACED. CONSEQUENTLY, I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF REPLACING MY FRONT WHEEL DRIVE BOOT AND AXLE AT A COST OF $695.00.  THIS COST SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY KIA",

IN MAY 2017 WHILE DRIVING HOME MY INSTRUMENT PANEL WENT OUT. UNABLE TO SEE SPEED, SAFETY WARNING LIGHTS, GAS ETC... I TOOK IT TO TWO DIFFERENT KIA SERVICE LOCATIONS TO TRACE PROBLEM. THEY FOUND A WIRE SHORTED TO GROUND ON THE TRAILER HITCH WIRING WHICH CAME WITH VEHICLE. THEY CUT THE WIRES TO TRAILER HARNESS AND THIS ISSUE ALSO DAMAGED MY REMOTE STARTER. THEY REPLACED THE BLOWN FUSE WITH A LARGER FUSE AND SAID IT WAS ALL SET. HOWEVER IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON 09/29/17. THIS TIME WHEN I PARKED MY CAR AND TRIED TO START AGAIN, IT WOULDN'T COME OUT OF PARK SO I HAD IT TOWED TO DEALER. IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY NOW BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO FIX THIS ISSUE WHICH IS OVER $3,000 TO FIX. THERE IS A FEW FEET OF BURNED AND MELTED WIRING THAT I HAVE PICTURES OF, UNSURE OF EXACT WIRING, BUT IT CONNECTED TO THE WIRING TRAILER HITCH HARNESS. IT WAS APPARENTLY CLOSE TO CATCHING ON FIRE.  SINCE I OWNED THE VEHICLE OTHER ODD ELECTRICAL ISSUES HAVE HAPPENED, INCLUDING BLOWN HEADLIGHTS AND BRAKE LIGHTS ON ABOUT 8 OCCASIONS. I ONLY FOUND ONE RECALL RELATING TO THE TRAILER HITCH WIRING HARNESS #16V862000 HOWEVER IT DOES NOT INCLUDE MY YEAR VEHICLE. IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION AND SAFETY CONCERN THAT KIA NEEDS TO RESEARCH FURTHER FOR POSSIBLE OTHER RECALLS.",

AS YOU WILL SEE FROM MY PREVIOUSLY FILED COMPLAINT, I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST ENGINE FAILURE ON APRIL 1, 2017.  BETWEEN APRIL 1ST AND MAY 31ST, I HAD EXPERIENCED THREE TOTAL FAILURES.     HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE APRIL 1ST FAILURE, I HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED AT MIDAS.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL RECALL AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME.  THE REPAIR SHOP REPLACED THE TIMING GEAR AND CLEANED THE ENGINE, BUT INFORMED ME THAT THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THE WORK.  THE COST FOR THESE SERVICES WAS $1,488.50.  I ALSO NEEDED TO REPLACE THE TIMING SOLENOIDS (I DID NOT HAVE THIS DONE AT MIDAS AT THE TIME BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY).  I PURCHASED THESE AT AUTO ZONE FOR $123.42.
