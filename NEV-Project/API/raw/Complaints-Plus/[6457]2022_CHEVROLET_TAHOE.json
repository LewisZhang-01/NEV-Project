Then, I started to lose power, like it was taking longer to shift. My safety and others were at risk because continuing to drive with lifter issues could\u2019ve caused engine failure, which could\u2019ve caused an accident. The problem was confirmed at a dealership. I don\u2019t know if anyone else inspected it. No lights appeared until after I had it towed to the dealership. They said the warning lights came on for them.",
