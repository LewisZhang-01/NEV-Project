THIS WAS AFTER HAVING THE ENTIRE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE CHECKED FOR ALIGNMENT, FAULTY OR DAMAGED PARTS, ANY ADJUSTMENTS OUT OF SPEC. THEY FOUND NO CAUSE. I DON'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER THE DATE AND HAVE ESTIMATED THE DATE BELOW. I EVENTUALLY SOLVED THE PROBLEM (AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH INDICATING THAT REPLACING THE CIRCUIT BOARD SOMETIMES WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX. THE SOLUTION WAS INSTALLING A \"KIT\" I FOUND ONLINE THAT COMPLETELY REMOVED THE NEW SPEED CONTROLLED POWER ASSISTANCE.  I PROBABLY HAD 4 OR 5 INSTANCES OF THIS OCCURRING, AND CONSIDER MYSELF EXTREMELY FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT OR INJURY.

ONE MAN SPENT $4000 TO HAVE THE ENTIRE FRONT END OF HIS VEHICLE REPLACED, ONLY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RECUR.

AT THIS TIME, IS IT NOT EVEN KNOWN WHEN THE PART WILL BECOME AVAILABLE. BEING AWARE OF THIS PROVES THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED. BECAUSE OF APPARENT POOR ENGINEERING, GM CAN NOT MANUFACTURER REPLACEMENTS FAST ENOUGH FOR ALL THE VEHICLES IN WHICH THEY ARE NEEDED.   INTAKE MANIFOLD LEAKS CAN LEAD TO ANY NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS, AND EXPENSIVE, PROBLEMS. WHILE THE PART ITSELF ISN'T COSTLY, THE LABOR TO REPAIR IT IS VERY INTENSIVE, AND HAS BEEN QUOTED AROUND $800 USD (GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED DEPENDING ON THE VEHICLE). THIS IS IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER COSTLY PROBLEM(S) THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET LEAK MAY HAVE PRODUCED.   WE ARE DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM GENERAL MOTORS. A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER SHOULD BE REASON ENOUGH FOR GM TO ASSEMBLE A RECALL. WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE WORLD'S LARGEST VEHICLE MANUFACTURER WHO HAS BEEN THE WORLD'S AUTOMOTIVE SALES LEADER SINCE 1931 WILL STAND UP AND CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PROBLEM THAT IS SO PREVALENT AMONG THEIR VEHICLES.

ONE WEEK LATER THE TRANSMISSION LOCKED UP AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME I COULDN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE WORK (SELF-EMPLOYED) AS I DID THE FIRST LOCK UP. SO, I GATHERED MY WITS ABOUT ME AND  OPENED THE TOWER/SHIFTER ROD TOP OF THE TRANNY. I FOUND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIFTER ROD OUT OF ITS DIVIT IN WHICH IT SHIFTS GEARS, AND ALSO SAW THAT THE REVERSE GEAR WAS THROWN INTO REVERSE. I THEN USED A SCREWDRIVER TO PRY THAT GEAR BACK INTO A NUETRAL POSITION.  I BUTTONED EVERYTHING BACK INTO PLACE AND RESUMED WORK. THIS BECAME A REGULAR PART OF MY JOBS; THAT IS, \"FIXING\" THE MANUFACTURER'S PROBLEMED PRODUCT. ABOUT 6 TO 8 MONTHS OF THIS MADDNESS WENT BY, WHEN ONE OF MY CLIENTS COMPLAINED THAT I SEEMED TO BE FIXING THE TRUCK MORE THAN WORKING IT TO FULFIL MY THE CONTRACT WITH HIM. AT THAT, I DECIDED ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH, AND VOWED THAT NEXT TIME THE LOCK UP OCCURED, I WOULD NOT FIX IT. I DIDN'T HAVE LONG TO WAIT BEFORE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE,AND THIS TIME I SENT THE TRUCK TO GMC'S OTHER REPAIR SHOP IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA, FB HART, HOPING FOR A REAL CURE. ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A CALL SAYING MY TRUCK WAS REPAIRED. IT DIDN'T LAST,BUT FEELING SIMPLY BEATEN BY THE BIG BOYS, I RESOLVED TO BEING A NOBODY AND KEPT FIXING IT MYSELF. HOWEVER, THIS TIME THE LOCK UP CAUSED REAR END DAMAGE, AMOUNTING TO $3501.44 AND RENTALS TOTALLING TO $9,000! I'M NEAR RUINED. GMC'S GAYLA CHASE SAYS THEY'RE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSMISSION.

THIS UN-PROTECTED OPENING ALLOWS DIRT TO ENTER THE TOP OF THE CANISTER AND EVENTUALLY CLOG THE OPENING. WHEN THIS OCCURS THE ENTIRE VACUM FORCE IS APPARENTLY DIRECTED TO THE FUEL TANK CAUSING FUEL TANK TO COLLAPSE. AN OLDER MODEL TRUCK (I BELIEVE IT WAS A 1997) WAS EXAMINED AND A SIMILAR CANISTER FRESH AIR VENT WAS STAMPED WITH THE WORDS \"AIR CLEANER\" THOUGH IT TOO WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE AIR CLEANER BUT WAS ONLY COVERED BY A LOOSE FITTING CAP. THIS PROBLEM IS PROBABLY NOT EVIDENT IN VEHICLES OPERATED ON HIGHWAY ONLY. A LOCAL SERVICE STATION, JOHN MELHISER'S AMOCO, PETERSBURG INDIANA, RELATED TO ME THAT HE KNEW OF 3 OTHER AREA PICKUPS (FARM USE) THAT EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM. SYMPTOMS OF EMMINENT FUEL TANK COLLAPSE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE ARE: 1-INCREASED VACUM IN FUEL TANK AS NOTICED WHEN REMOVING THE FUEL CAP; 2 FUEL GAGE BEGINS TO MALFUNCTION (CAUSED BY BOTTOM OF TANK BEING PUSHED UPWARD ON THE SENDING UNIT). I SUSPECT THAT THE EFFECT IS MORE PRONOUNCED AT LOWER FUEL LEVELS. I CONTACTED GM'S CUSTOMER SERVICE # JAN 26 THIS YEAR. I CONTACTED THEM AGAIN MARCH 16. THEY INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN NOTED BUT THAT NO FIRTHER ACTION WAS PLANNED. GM INDICATED THAT A \"PRODUCT ALLEGATION REPORT\" COULD BE FILED IF THE PROBLEM CAUSED SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE OR BODILY HARM. I SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST PRODUCE A MAINTENANCE INSERT FOR THE OWNERS MANUAL AND SERVICE BULLETINS SINCE DEALERS I CHECKED WITH WERE NOT AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR PLUGGING OF THE VENT AND COLLAPSE OF THE FUEL TANK.  A MORE SECURE FIX WOULD BE TO VENT THE SUCTION TO THE AIR CLEANER (AS WAS APPARENTLY INTENDED ON THE EARLIER MODEL) TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN MATTER DOES NOT CLOG THE VENT.",
