The car only suffered cosmetic damage thankfully, but the air bags did not deploy.  I have since then found out that the front air bag crash sensors are in a spot where they are practically useless unless you hit something pretty high up and destroy the headlights in the process.  In my opinion, this is a serious safety issue, and when I contacted Hyundai about it, all they told me was to go to the dealership for inspection.  I have pictures showing that the crash sensors are located at and not where they should be, and if you open the hood, the wiring for the sensors is right in your face.  I still have high anxiety knowing that if I get into another accident, they may not deploy due to their location.   At least the car is still drivable and no structural damage or alignment issues are there.  As you can see in the pictures the sensors are close to where the hood closes at the top support bar.",

Soon enough, all the lights went back off, but the mileage gauge (fuel efficiency) continued to jump wildly. The brakes seemed to respond differently- almost as if there was a delay between me pressing the brake and the brakes catching. When I needed to accelerate, the car seemed to be having trouble switching between the electric and gas motors. I was able to drive to a safe location and shut the car off. This was terrifying, as the car's computer system or electrical system clearly failed, even if temporarily. The car was taken to the dealership immediately. The car's mileage is under 4, 500 miles and was purchased in February 2021. There have been other small issues but never anything like this. The display screen has gone black before a few times, my cell phone won't connect (even manually and it's properly connected, working seamlessly other times).
