I BROUGHT IT TO MY GARAGE TO HAVE MY DSG INSPECTED.  THE MECHANICS FOUND OUT THAT THE CIRCLIP HOLDING THE CLUTCH PACK OF THE DSG FLEW OFF.  THE FIX WAS DONE BY REPLACING THE CIRCLIP OF THE CLUTCH PACK.  THE CAR THEN WENT FINE.  FASTFORWARD TO 2 NIGHTS AGO (JULY 10TH OR ABOUT ONLY 1,500KM LATER), MY DSG'S INSTRUMENT CLUSTER STARTED SHOWING MY THE \"FLASH OF DEATH\" WHEREIN THE \"PRND\" LIGHTS KEPT ON FLASHING ACCOMPANIED BY DIFFICULTY IN CHANGING GEARS!
