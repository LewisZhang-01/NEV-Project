AT ONE POINT, IT LOOKED LIKE A MOSQUITO SPRAYING TRUCK GOING DOWN THE ROAD.  BUT THAT ISSUE SEEMED TO ABATE, AND APPEARED TO BE UNDER CONTROL ON ITS OWN.  NOW THE CAR IS BURNING A QUART OF OIL EVERY 300 MILES.   THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND AFTER A YEARLONG ATTEMPT TO WATCH THE PROBLEM, TO SEE IF IT COULD BE CONTROLLED, I FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION, THAT IT COULD NOT, AND THAT THE TURBOCHARGED HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I THUS MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE MAZDA DEALER CLOSEST TO MY CURRENT RESIDENCE, PADUCAH MAZDA, IN PADUCAH, KY.  I TOOK THE CAR IN YESTERDAY, AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT OIL WAS LEAKING FROM MY TURBOCHARGER SEALS.    THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN AND PREVALENT, SUBJECT TO A NHTSA INQUIRY #10043874.  AND AS A RESULT MAZDA ISSUED A LETTER EXTENDING THE WARRANTY FOR THIS PROBLEM TO 84 MONTHS OR 70,000 MILES.  I DO NOT RECALL RECEIVING THIS LETTER, OR IF I DID, AT THAT TIME DID NOT BELIEVE I HAD A PROBLEM WORTHY OF A NEW TURBOCHARGER.    SO YESTERDAY, THE MAZDA CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM, AND GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $2500 TO REPLACE THE TURBOCHARGER.  SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN, DOCUMENTED, AND SUBJECT OF A MAZDA WARRANTY CONSIDERATION, I CALLED MAZDA CONSUMER SERVICE TO SEE IF MAZDA COULD OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE ON THIS SERVICE ISSUE.  I OFFERED TO WORK WITH THEM, TO PAY SOME PORTION OF THE REPAIR, MEET THEM IN THE MIDDLE IF POSSIBLE.  MY REQUEST WAS DENIED IN TOTAL; ?NO ASSISTANCE?.    NATURALLY, I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RESULT, GIVEN THAT I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL MAZDA OWNER.  I AM VERY SURPRISED WITH THIS ABRUPT AND NEGATIVE TREATMENT FROM MAZDA, GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THIS PROBLEM.

I'M A SAFE DRIVER AND KEEP MY CAR MAINTAINED WELL. THE \"WHITE SMOKE\" IS MOST VISIBLE AT IDLE. I DID NOT WISH TO GET AN EMISSIONS TICKET, SO I PARKED IT IN MY PARENTS GARAGE. HAVING TO BORROW A ANOTHER CAR IS A REAL PAIN. I HAVE READ UPON MANY SITE'S AND FORUMS TRYING TO SEE IF THIS IS A EASY FIX. IT HAS COME TO A CONCLUSION IT IS NOT. THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALERS HAVE PUSHED ME AWAY DUE TO THIS WHITE SMOKE. I FEEL DISRESPECTED AS A MAZDA OWNER TO BE TURNED DOWN ON ANY HELP ABOUT THIS FAILURE. I HAVE SPENT OVER A $1000 DOLLARS TO TRY LOCAL SHOPS AND STILL THIS FAILURE IS KILLING MY BUDGET. I DO HOPE TO RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FROM MAZDA CORP.

TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER:  CHANGED THE ENGINE COOLING THERMOSTAT, THE RADIATOR CAP, COOLANT RESERVOIR TANK AND RE-FLASHED THE POWERTRAIN. WAS TOLD THAT RESIDUAL SMELL WILL LINGER FOR A COUPLE WEEKS. THE OVERHEATING SMELL PERSISTS INSIDE THE CAR WHEN THE AIR VENT IS SET AT COLD OUTSIDE AIR. USUALLY SMELL STARTS IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER A MILE OF ORDINARY CITY DRIVE AT 25 MPH TO 35 MPH ON FLAT ROAD. IT GETS STRONGER AND SOMETIMES HOT AIR BLOWS IN WHEN THE DAY IS WARM (AROUND 68F TO ABOVE 70F). IF CAR IS PARKED FOR HOURS IN AN OPEN SPACE AFTER SEVERAL MILES DRIVE, HOT AIR AND SMELL BLOWS IMMEDIATELY AT START AND STAY ON. ON FREEWAY  THE SMELL IS LESS STRONG BUT BECOMES VERY BAD WHEN EXIT  TO A STOP SIGN. DURING THE COOLER DAYS OF 50F TO 65F, THE ONSET OF THE OVERHEATING SMELL IS DELAY. THERE IS NO SUCH SMELL IN THE VENT AIR WHEN SET FOR ''WARM'' AIR AT NIGHT OR AT ''AIR CONDITION'' TO CHECK IF SMELL IS FROM AIR DUCT. NOW THE CAR HAS 3000 MILES ON IT AND THE SMELL PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.  A FEW TIMES I HAVE HEADACHE AFTER DRIVING WITH THE SMELL.   FOR THIS PROBLEM I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR FOUR TIMES BETWEEN BOTH DEALERS AND CALLED THE MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER TWO TIMES. EACH TIME THEY DID A PRESSURE LEAK TEST AND TOLD ME THE CAR IS OK WITHIN MANUFACTURER''S SPECS.  THEY ALL CLAIMED THAT THERE IS NO SUCH SMELL IN THE DRIVING CONDITIONS AS I DESCRIBED. NOTHING IS DONE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM.  LAST MONTH FOUND OIL STAIN UNDER CAR AND SOME RADIATOR HOSES TURN WHITE WITH POWDER. LAST WEEK THE LOCAL DEALER CHANGED THE LEAKING STRUT AND THE SLIGHTLY LEAKING OVERFLOW TUBE TO THE COOLANT RESERVOIR TANK. IT ALSO SAID COLOR CHANGE OF RADIATOR HOSE INTO ENGINE IS NORMAL.    *JB",

BY LATE SEPTEMBER THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE WORSENING. BY MID-OCTOBER IT WAS STUTTERING CONSTANTLY WHEN DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC. THE PROBLEM WORSENED WITH COOL WEATHER WHEN THE ENGINE IS COLD. ON NIGHTS BELOW ABOUT 30 DEGREES, THE CAR STUTTERS AND BUCKS SEVERELY FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES UNTIL THE ENGINE IS WARMED UP. ACCELERATION IS SOMETIMES UNPREDICTABLE DURING THIS TIME.     SO FAR, MAZDA HAS REPLACED THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR AND UPDATED THE ECU TO THE LATEST AVAILABLE AS OF NOVEMBER. SPARK PLUGS WERE REPLACED PRIOR TO THIS PER MY REQUEST. NOTHING SEEMS TO MAKE AN IMPACT.     IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THIS PROBLEM (COLD START) SEEMS TO WORSEN ON ROUGH/UNEVEN ROADS.
