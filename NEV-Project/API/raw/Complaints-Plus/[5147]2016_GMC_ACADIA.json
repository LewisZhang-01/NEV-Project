I picked my vehicle up on Thursday evening. I got up at 6:00 on Friday March 18th and noticed my OnStar diagnostic report had come through at 12:00 am and stated there was a problem with my emissions/transmission. I immediately at 8:30 called GMC manufacturing and they told me to take the vehicle back and GMC manufacturing made me a 1:00 appointment for the same say while I was on the phone. I had to be at work at 12 noon so my husband took it there and came back and told me that my transmission was bad. The dealership offered to but my vehicle back fir $18,500 or pay for the repairs myself $3.909. I asked for assistance since this was the initial problem I took it in for and it has network weeks and I haven\u2019t heard anything. This month is my 2 year anniversary of owning it. I informed the dealership about the Special Warranty coverage and they stated that this was not covered but I explained to them that the coverage is limited to 150,000 miles and that my vehicle only has 120,000 miles on it so I am confused and seeking clarification and explanation from a higher source and no one has contacted in 2 weeks.",

Over 60% of the people killed in auto accidents were not wearing a seatbelt. Why? Because of the fear of being trapped. All first responders carry a seat belt cutter. There are a lot of seat belt cutters on the market today. That proves to me that a seat belt will trap you in a vehicle in its present design. In an accident the seat belt shoulder portion will tighten down. Under pressure, it will not release until you back off the pressure. Under certain circumstances you may not be able to back off the pressure which causes difficulty to release the belt. I have designed, manufactured, and installed a prototype of belt release in my vehicle. I call it my Designated Emergency Seatbelt Hinge. I have also filed for, and received a patent for my design. I believe all vehicles should have an D E S H installed. I don't understand why seat belts only have one release point.",

MY VEHICLE HAS TWO EVAPORATORS, ONE IN THE FRONT FOR THE FRONT AC, AND ONE IN THE REAR FOR THE REAR AC. THEY ARE CONNECTED BY AN ALUMINUM TUBE (GM PART #23199274). WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE GMC DEALER, THEY SHOWED ME THAT A CONNECTOR ON THE POWER STEERING FLUID (PSF) LINE, WHICH RUNS BESIDE THIS ALUMINUM TUBE (SEE PHOTO 1), HAD RUBBED UP AGAINST THE ALUMINUM AND WORN A HOLE IN IT, ALLOWING ALL THE REFRIGERANT TO LEAK OUT (PHOTO 2). THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE RUBBER PIECE THAT FITS OVER AND PROTECTS THE COOLANT LINE (YOU CAN SORT-OF SEE IT IN THE PICTURES), BUT THAT PIECE IS SMALL AND SLIDES DOWN, EXPOSING THE ALUMINUM TUBE. THE TECHNICIAN THEN TOLD/SHOWED ME HOW HE USUALLY BENDS OR MOVES THE PSF LINE SO THAT IT DOESN'T RUB AGAINST THE ALUMINUM COOLANT TUBE. THIS INDICATES THAT GM IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND HAS DONE NOTHING IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIX IT, EVEN THOUGH THIS INHERENT DESIGN FLAW ALLOWS THE ENTIRE COOLANT CHARGE TO LEAK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, SINCE REFRIGERANT IS NOT EXACTLY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, I FIND IT CONCERNING THAT GM IS APPARENTLY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HASN'T TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS (LIKE A VOLUNTARY RECALL) TO FIX IT.  I CALLED THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THE SITUATION, AND THEY SAID \"THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.\" I'M HOPING THIS COMPLAINT FORCES THEM TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND STOP LEAKING FULL REFRIGERANT CHARGES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.    NOTE THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE AN ISSUE IF THE SITUATION WERE REVERSED AND IT WAS THE AC COOLANT TUBE THAT CHAFED THROUGH THE PSF HOSE. IF THE PSF CONNECTOR WAS EVEN 1 CM OFF, THEN HYPOTHETICALLY THE COOLANT TUBE COULD RUB THROUGH THE PSF HOSE AND CAUSE A FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM.

I WORK IN REAL ESTATE SALES AND AFTER SHOWING HOME SITES TO A POTENTIAL BUYER I RETURNED TO MY MODEL PARKING LOT. I PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PARKING THE CAR WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY BEGAN REVVING. I WAS ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE PARKING BLOCK AND I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. I TRIED TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK BUT IT WOULD NOT MOVE. THE CAR KEPT REVVING AND JERKED FORWARD WITH SO MUCH FORCE THAT I WENT OVER THE PARKING BLOCK, THROUGH THE BUSHES AND THROUGH THE PVC FENCE. I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE THE ENTIRE TIME AND KEPT TRYING TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK. AFTER A FEW FEET BEYOND THE FENCE THE CAR FINALLY WENT INTO PARK AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR. I AM COMPLETELY GRATEFUL THAT NO PEDESTRIANS WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. AS I AM SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS TERRIFIED TO GET BACK INTO THE CAR. I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND HAD HIM BRING ME THE OTHER CAR SO I CAN FINISH OUT MY WORK DAY. THE ACADIA IS OUR FAMILY CAR AND THE CAR THAT TRANSPORTS OUR FOUR CHILDREN. MY HUSBAND TOOK THE CAR INTO  FERMAN DEALERSHIP, THE DEALERSHIP WHICH WE LEASED THE CAR FROM, AND THEY BLEW HIM OFF SAYING THAT I PROBABLY GOT CONFUSED BETWEEN THE BRAKE AND THE THROTTLE. I AM 41 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINCE I WAS 16 AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I DID NOT GET CONFUSED AND I FIND IT COMPLETELY INSULTING THAT THEY EVEN SAID THAT.   IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT WE HAVE ANY LEGAL RECOURSE FOR BEING ABLE TO TERMINATE OUR LEASE DUE TO THIS, WHICH IS WHAT WE WOULD WANT. I WANT THIS INCIDENT REPORTED IN WRITING SHOULD GOD FORBID IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND THERE IS MORE DAMAGE THAN JUST TWO FENCE PANELS.",
