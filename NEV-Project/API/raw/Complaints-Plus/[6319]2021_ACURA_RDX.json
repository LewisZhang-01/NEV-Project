I got 5 feet into the lane and the car slammed on its brakes, on its own!!! Thank god no one was behind me or i might have died!! I reported this to Acura within 1 week, and then reported it to DOT the next week. I own one of the first 2021 s made, so i didn\u2019t see a lot of feedback. Now after a year and a half i get on the  DOT website and see many complaints like mine. This has happens to me maybe once every 3 weeks. Why has the DOT done nothing about this??!!! Also the DOT says there are no recalls on my car but if you go to the Acura website it says my car is under recall for a driveshaft problem, of which i never received a notice. Why does the DOT exist??",

        "summary": "I own a 2021 Acura RDX that was purchased new in February 2021.  In the 11,500 miles I have driven it, there have been zero problems until yesterday.  However, yesterday, when driving on an Interstate highway at 70 mph, in the rain, while passing a semi truck, my Acura RDX suddenly went into limp mode and the check engine light began flashing.  After pulling over to the berm, and driving in the limp mode to the next exit, I turned the engine off.  When I turned the engine back on it functioned normally and the check engine light went out.  The engine has functioned normally for the approximately 100 miles I have driven since that time.  Since there is no problem now, I have not taken the vehicle to the dealer to be checked since I felt that they would find nothing.  When looking up this problem I found that mine is not an isolated case, and this same thing has happened to other Acura RDX owners.  For that reason I am reporting the problem.  I have also written to Acura to tell them of the problem.  This was a very scary situation to have the engine suddenly, and without warning, go into limp mode while on a busy Interstate highway.  Fortunately, in this case I was able to safely get to the berm of the road, but that might not always be possible.  I have no idea when this might happen again, which is also scary.  It is also very strange that by turning the engine off and then back on the problem disappeared.   If requested, I would be happy to have Acura look at my vehicle if it would help to find the root cause of this problem.  Thank you for your review of this problem.",

        "summary": "On May 9th we were driving on the freeway at around 3 pm on a sunlit clear day. It was a straight section of road. Dry pavement and traffic moving reasonably well. The car in front of us was at least 100 yards in front of us and about the same for the vehicle behind I believe. We were going around 50 mph. The car slammed on the brakes so hard the seat belt restraints engaged as we flew forward, enough so that my wife and I were both sore the next day. Items on the back seat flew onto the floor. If there had been a car behind us we would have been rear ended and potentially a multi car pile up. We took the car to the dealership the next day. They had the car for the day and returned it saying everything is calibrated as it should be. I have called Acura and they set up a case number and a case manager and said they would call me. They have not called nor returned my repeated phone calls. I have asked for a supervisor to call and that has not happened either. Acura\u2019s case number is 12213602 and Simon is the case manager. His phone is 800 999 1009 x87723. The supervisor\u2019s name is Terry. I don\u2019t have an extension number for her.  We have grandkids that ride in car seats in the back seat. Thank god this didn\u2019t happen with one or both in the back seat with a car behind us.  We have been driving cars with the braking feature on them for 10 years now (Ford and Infinity) and have never had anything like this happen. We\u2019ve had the adaptive cruise pick up on something in the past and ease off the accelerator but never anything like this. The cruise was not engaged when this occurred.  In googling this it sounds like we aren\u2019t the only ones having this issue.",
