I WAS IN SLOW MOVING TRAFFIC ON A HIGHWAY AND HAD TO BRAKE HARD FOR TRAFFIC WHICH HAD STOPPED. I COLLIDED WITH NOTHING.  THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED,  EXPLODED AND SHATTERED AS IT DEPLOYED, BURST INTO FLAMES AND A PIECE OF THE AIRBAG LANDED ON MY ARM BURNING ME AND LEAVING A SCAR.  THE DETONATOR O THE STEERING REMAINED IN FLAMES FOR SEVERAL MINUTES SMELLING OF GUNPOWDER.     RESEARCHING THIS CAR RENTAL COMPANY ONLINE LATER, THERE APPEARS TO BE A PATTERN - CARS RENTED FROM THIS COMPANY AT VERY LOW RATES WHICH ARE CLAIMED TO BE DAMAGED WHEN RETURNED AND THEN BILLING THE CAR RENTER'S INSURANCE COMPANY AND USING A REPAIR SHOP THAT SEEMS TO BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OWNER OF THE CAR RENTAL COMPANY.ALSO, THE CLAIMS COMPANY THE CAR RENTAL USES SEEMS VERY INVOLVED IN THIS POTENTIAL SIDE INDUSTRY AS WELL.  BECAUSE THEIR RENTAL RATES ARE SO LOW, THIS HAS MADE ME SUSPICIOUS.  THE CARS THEY RENT OUT ARE NOT NEW.  I HAVE THE VPN NUMBER THAT WAS SUPPLIED TO THE BODY SHOP FOR THE REPAIR BUT HAVE CONCERNS THE VPN MAY NOT BE CORRECT EITHER.  WHAT I DO HAVE IS A PIECE OF FABRIC FROM THE AIRBAG.  I WAS HOPING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE AIRBAG THAT BURNED ME AND BE SURE THAT IT IS NOT EITHER A TAKATA AIRBAG OR SOME GENERIC BRAND X AIRBAG THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THIS MODEL CAR.

THE SALES GUY SAID THEY CANNOT RESELL THE CAR AND WOULD SEND IT TO THE AUCTION FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. HE ALSO SAID THAT FORD HAS NO PLANS TO MAKE THE REPAIRS AND THAT ANY DEALER THAT SAYS THEY HAVE A REPAIR SCHEDULE IS LYING. I BESEECH THE NHTSA TO FORCE FORD TO MAKE THE REPAIRS ON OUR CAR NOW OR ELSE DEMAND THAT THEIR DEALERS GIVE US WHAT THE TRUE, FAIR MARKET VALUE WOULD BE IF THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN RECALLED.
