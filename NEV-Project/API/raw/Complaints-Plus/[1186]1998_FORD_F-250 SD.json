THEN IT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER SIDE WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT ABOUT 2 MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT HAD HAPPENED DOING THE SAME THING WITHOUT ANY WARNING IT WOULD HAPPEN.THESE PARTS ARE POORLY PUT ON BY THE MANUFACTUER.  IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING ON A HIGHWAY AT A GREATER SPEED THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A TERIBLE ACCIDENT CAUSING GREAT INJURY OR DEATH TO ME OR OTHERS. THERE IS BARELY ANYTHING HOLDING THESE ENDS ON STOPPING THEM FROM COMING OFF.  THE DEALERSHIP NOW SAYS IT SHOULD REPLACE ALL OF THE MANUFACTUERS PARTS JUST TO BE ABLE TO LINE THE TRUCK BACK OUT OF COURSE THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE. I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF THERES ANY THING I CAN DO TO PREVENT FURTHER PROBLEM AND SEE IF THIS IS A REACCURING PROBLEM WITH OTHER TRUCKS LIKE MINE FROM THE FORD COMPANY.  DT",
