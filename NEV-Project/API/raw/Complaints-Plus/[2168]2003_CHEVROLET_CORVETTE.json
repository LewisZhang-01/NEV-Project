I BELIEVE THAT THIS FAILURE CONSTITUTES A SAFETY PROBLEM. AFTER MANY MONTHS OF THIS (I WASN'T OVERLY CONCERNED SINCE I DON'T DRIVE ERRATICALLY AND RARELY ACTIVATE THE ACTIVE HANDLING SYSTEM), I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALER (WEST CHEVROLET, ALCOA, TN) AND WAS TOLD (1) THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE ON CORVETTES AND (2) IT IS DUE TO THE WIRING HARNESS IN THE STEERING COLUMN BEING TOO SHORT. (THIS CAR HAS A POWER TELESCOPING STEERING WHEEL AND MEMORY SEATS SO THAT EVERY TIME THE DRIVER GETS IN AND OUT OF THE CAR, THE STEERING COLUMN AUTOMATICALLY MOVES OUT AND IN, EVIDENTLY TUGGING ON THE WIRING HARNESS EACH TIME.) THE DEALERS TECHNICIAN FOREMAN SAID THAT ONE OF SIGNALS CARRIED BY THE HARNESS IS THE ANGLE OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A YAW-RATE SENSOR TO DETERMINE IF THE CAR IS \"SPINNING OUT\" AND WHAT CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED TO CORRECT THIS. HE ALSO SAID THAT DUE TO THE TOO-SHORT HARNESS, THE INTEGRITY OF THE HARNESS CONNECTOR DEGRADES OVER TIME CAUSING THE INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE ACTIVE HANDLING SYSTEM.  (3) THE DEALER SAID THAT THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED BY EXTENDING THE HARNESS WITH A GM PART WHICH IMPLIES THAT GM KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND HAVE DEVELOPED A PART TO FIX IT. (4) I ASKED THE DEALER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I DID NOT FIX IT. I WAS TOLD THAT EVENTUALLY THE CONNECTOR WOULD COMPLETELY FAIL RESULTING IN A LOSS OF THE POWER STEERING. THIS WOULD THEN BE ANOTHER SAFETY PROBLEM. SO I HAD TO HAVE IT FIXED BUT IT WASN'T CHEAP - $594.68.  *TR",

MY CHEVROLET TAHOE HAS BOTH THESE ISSUES.  THEY STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE LETTER.

I TRAVEL THROUGH A LOT OF RURAL AREAS TO WORK AND I FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT RUN OUT OF GAS.  I FEEL IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  THE SPEEDOMETER REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING 60 OR 70 MILES PER HOUR WHEN I AM SITTING AT A RED LIGHT.  WHEN I AM GOING DOWN THE ROAD IT REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING OVER 120 MILES PER HOUR.

WHEN I COMPLETED THE TASK AND STARTED THE AUTOMOBILE THE FUEL GAUGE AND THE HUD DID NOT AGREE.  THE FUEL GAUGE WAS ON EMPTY AND THE HUD AT ONE-HALF FULL.  I DROVE TO THE AIRPORT AND PICKED UP MY WIFE.  I RETURNED HOME AND PULLED INTO THE GARAGE FOR THE NIGHT AND THE FUEL GAUGE AND HUD DID NOT CHANGE. ONCE INSIDE MY HOME, I WROTE AN EMAIL TO MITCH CONGDON, WHO IS THE SERVICE DIRECTOR AT VAN CHEVROLET IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA, DESCRIBING MY DILEMA.  IN ADDITION, I LET MR. CONGDON KNOW THAT MY WIFE WOULD BE BRINGING MY CAR IN ON FRIDAY SO THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE INVESTIGATED.  I ALSO TOOK DIGITAL PICTURES OF THE FUEL GAUGE AND HUD AFTER PULLING THE CAR INTO THE GARAGE FOR THE NIGHT.  WHEN MY WIFE STARTED THE CAR IN THE MORNING THE FUEL GAUGE AND HUD READINGS MATCHED AT FULL.  VAN CHEVROLET REPLACED THE LEFT FUEL TANK SENDING UNIT.  PERHPAS IT WAS AN ERROR, BUT THE MILEAGE ON MY INVOICE #600182  WAS ~3,000 MILES MORE THAN THE ACTUAL READING.  THE RIGHT ONE HAD BEEN REPLACED IN AUGUST 2004 AFTER THE IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS OCCURRED.  IN ADDITION, I USED ONLY CHEVRON SUPREME GASOLINE AND ADDED A BOTTLE OF TECHRON TO THE TANK EVERY 3,000 MILES.  ON SATURDAY, JUNE 18, 2005 I TOOK PICTURES OF THE FUEL GAUGE AND HUD TO FURTHER RECORD THE READINGS.  THE PICTURES ARE TIME AND DATE STAMPED.  IT IS DISCONCERTING TO ME THAT I OWN A WORLD CLASS SPORTS CAR THAT I HAVE TO USE THE TRIP ODOMETER TO GAUGE THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IN MY GAS TANKS.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT GM HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME, AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT FIX INVOLVING NEW COMPUTER BOARS THAT ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.
