THE GAS PEDAL WOULD STICK EVERY NOW AND THEN, AND THE ONLY WAY TO RELEASE IT WAS TO PUSH DOWN ON IT WITH YOU FOOT AND IT WOULD RESUME.  UNFORTUNTLY, HE WAS DRIVING ON THE I-5 FREEWAY NEAR GRANTS PASS, OREGON WHEN IT STUCK AND HE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  HE HIT A SEMI TRUCK, THEN A 2ND SEMI TRUCK, AND WAS CITED FOR RECKLESS DRIVING, ALTHOUGH DRIVING THE LEGAL SPEED LIMIT ON DRY PAVEMENT.  MY SON IS 31.  THE STATE POLICE GAVE HIM A BLOOD TEST FOR ALLEGED DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BUT IT CAME UP NEGATIVE.  HE IS SUFFERING MUSCULAR INJURIES AS IS HIS GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE.  THE GAS PEDAL STICKING WOULD HAPPEN A COUPLE OF TIMES A MONTH, JUST OFF AND ON, AND I CURRENTLY ONLY WORK PART TIME SINCE LOOSING MY FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT THIS PAST JUNE (2010).  THE VEHICLE IS TOTALED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.  I AM NOW WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION AND HAVE TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE, AND/OR HAVE REPAIRED AN OLD CAR I HAVE SITTING AT HOME.  I WONDER IF OTHER MADZA TRIBUTES ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",

IT IS USED FOR LOCAL DRIVING ONLY AS I WOULD BE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ANY FURTHER THAN THAT.  I ALSO NEED FRONT STABILIZER LINKS.  I JUST REPLACED THE BATTERY BUT NOW WHEN I TRY TO START THE VEHICLE, EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP BUT IT DOESN'T START OR MAKE ANY SOUND WHEN I TURN THE KEY.  I HAVE TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT FINALLY STARTS.  I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE NEW AND I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS.  THE FRONT WHEEL DRIVE IS WORTHLESS, I SLIDE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND FISH TAIL BACKING UP IN MY DRIVEWAY.
