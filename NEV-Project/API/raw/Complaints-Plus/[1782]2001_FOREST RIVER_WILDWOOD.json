I AM AGAIN ON THE ROAD, BLEW ANOTHER TIRE, STOPPED IN ALBUQUERQUE NM AT WALMART AND REPLACED THE TIRE (THEY ALSO KEPT THE BAD TIRE).  LUCKILY I DID NOT HAVE ANY MORE BLOWOUTS FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP.  I WENT TO OK TIRE ON SEPT 28 WHICH IS WHERE I PURCHASED THE TIRES ORGINALLY AND THEY ASKED THAT I BRING THE REMAINING THREE TIRES UP FOR INSPECTION.  THEY ALSO WERE FALLING APART.  IT LOOKS AS IF THEY ARE DEFECTIVE AND OK TIRE AS MUCH AS SAID SO.  OK TIRE IS SENDING THE TIRES TO TCI (TIRE CENTERS INC) FOR EVALUATION.  I WILL PROBABLY GET NEW TIRES FOR THE THREE, BUT I FEEL I SHOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE TWO NEW TIRES I HAD TO PURCHASE.  THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED AN  ACCIDENT, DEATH AND/OR BOTH.  I AM NOT ASKING FOR A MILLION DOLLARS I AM ASKING FOR MY MONEY BACK.  IF THE TIRES HAD BEEN PROPERLY MANUFACTERED THERE WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE. THE TIRES WERE ONLY A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OLD..
