There is no chip or indentation. Crack is about the length of 2 dollar bills. I feel this is a manufacturing defect and should be paid for by Subaru. This is absolutely faulty craftsmanship and I am extremely disappointed with the durability considering I take excellent care of my vehicle and have had it for less than 1 year! Not to mention, I do not even want to think about the lack of protection this windshield would have provided me if I were ever been in an accident. As a mother, I prefer to drive a vehicle that is safe with my 2 year old daughter in the back seat. I read that there is an ongoing lawsuit with Subaru concerning 2017-2019 vehicles with windshield defects. I am not the only individual experiencing this. Not to mention, this is not an expense I was prepared for and shouldn\u2019t have to be, if Subaru would make a windshield that was not faulty and safe for its consumers!

This repair costs $1000 each time and from what I have read, Subaru is aware that this is not an isolated incident with these windshields.

I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH MY CAR, AND THAT MY CAR WOULD BE THE \"GUINEA PIG\" TO FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION.

CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AFTER LEAVING, AS THE BRAKES CONTINUED TO MAKE THE NOISE, AND HAD STARTED TO SMELL LIKE BURNING RUBBER. I EMAILED VIDEOS OF THE NOISE ON 9/25, AND 9/30. I CALLED AND I WAS TOLD TO BRING THE CAR IN ON 10/6/2020, THOUGH THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT IT THEN.

MILEAGE IN WAS 31,908, MILEAGE OUT WAS 32,044. INSPECTION BY THE TECH FOUND THAT THE ROTORS WERE HOT SPOTTED AND PADS WERE DISCOLORED. REPLACED FRONT PADS AND ROTORS. ON 10/27/2020  I EMAILED AGAIN WITH MORE VIDEOS OF THE BRAKES CONTINUING TO SQUEAL. I WAS ASKED IF I COULD BRING THE CAR IN, AND I DID AGAIN, SAME DAY. MILEAGE WAS 32,482. I WAS THEN TOLD AT PICKUP ON 11/4/2020 THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE NOISE WAS BEING CAUSED BY A \"SLAG GREASE BUILDUP ON THE CALIPER PINS.\" I WAS TOLD THAT SHOULD REMEDY THE PROBLEM.

SUBARU CORPORATE HAS OFFERED ME EITHER A WARRANTY EXTENSION ON THE CAR IF I CHOOSE TO KEEP IT OR A VOUCHER FOR $2,500 IF I WANTED TO TRADE IN THE CAR AT THE END OF MY LEASE.  IN DECEMBER OF 2019 I AGREED TO THIS BUT SINCE THEN I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR BACK INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND AFTER A MONTHS TIME OF WORKING ON THE CAR THEY STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR THE ISSUE.
