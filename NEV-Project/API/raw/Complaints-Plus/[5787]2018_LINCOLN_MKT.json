        "summary": "My wife and I purchased a Certified, Pre-Owned, 2018 Lincoln MKT for her in July.  Last month we finally looked at dash covers.  Many Ford vehicles, including ours, have Adaptive Cruise Control.  One feature included in this option is a Collision Warning System which flashes a row of red lights on the dash when it activates.  Several manufacturers required the dash cover purchaser to check off whether, or not, their vehicle had Adaptive Cruise Control.  My wife liked a fabric pattern offered by Coverking.  When I found no place to check off Adaptive Cruise Control on their order system, I stopped placing the order and sent them an inquiry as to whether their dash covers had the necessary cutout for this feature because it doesn\u2019t do any good to have such a great safety feature if the dash cover blocks the flashing lights.  They responded and referred me to the following on their website \u201cAll Coverking Dash Covers are designed from the original vehicle dashboard using sophisticated software.  Therefore, all cutouts, sensors,  cup holders, and airbag openings are studied and the Coverking Dash Cover is designed not to interfere. Making the Coverking Dash Cover a superior product over the competition.\u201d  With that assurance, I returned to the website and placed my order.  I was surprised to receive a dash cover with no cutout for the red lights.  See attached picture.  Please note that I MADE THE CUTOUT shown in the picture.  You can see the absence of the black edge trim around the cutout I made.   Blocking the driver from being able to see a very important safety feature when it activates, and which is intended to help the driver avoid a collision. is inexcusable. Question:  \u201cHow many avoidable accidents have drivers had due to the negligence of Coverking in not providing the necessary cutout over the Collision warning red lights?\u201d",
