I immediately downshifted(automatic trans), used the emergency break almost killed some pedestrians.. pulled over. I checked all fuses, breaks. etc.   I did not have any money, so as nightfall came upon us, with ABS glaring in our ears. I drove through the night back to Utah when the traffic was the lowest and used the emergency break all the way home, it was a horrific experience.     The repair on this was not cheep where I had the ABS/brakes fixed so the breaks would work at our local dealer where I live, This was about 8-10 years ago, I am still pretty upset someone cold have been killed, why would the breaks fail if the ABS fails.. this could have killed my family and/or someone else.   I would have to check with Menlove Bountiful Toyota for an exact date of repair.",

OR DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR THINGS I MIGHT DO TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE WHEEL OF MY FATHERS CAR BROKE OFF ON A FLAT STRAIGHT ROAD WITHOUT ANY OTHER CARS INVOLVED.
