        "summary": "THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED TO ME IN 2014 AND I DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL RECENTLY TALKING TO OTHER OWNERS OF THE AIRSTREAM INTERSTATE WHO HAVE HAD SIMILAR OR WORSE INCIDENTS. THAT KNOWLEDGE CAUSED ME TO FILE THIS BELATED REPORT SINCE CURRENT AIRSTREAM INTERSTATES HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE.    THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED ON THURSDAY 3/13/2014 WHILE DRIVING FROM GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK TO VISIT FRIENDS IN NEW MEXICO. I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AT A SCENIC LOOKOUT SPOT THAT HAD A LOT OF VERY ROUGH PAVEMENT. I ROLLED SLOWLY OVER ONE PARTICULARLY BAD SPOT BUT DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WAS ABNORMAL.    WHEN I REACHED THE DESTINATION CAMPGROUND THAT AFTERNOON I DISCOVERED THE TRUE DAMAGE TO THE LP FILL PANEL ON MY 2013 AIRSTREAM INTERSTATE. THE PROTECTIVE COVER FOR THE PANEL AND THE LP QUICK-CONNECT FITTING WERE MISSING. I ONLY DISCOVERED THE DAMAGE BECAUSE I WAS USING THE LP STOVE INSIDE MY VAN TO COOK DINNER AND SMELLED A STRONG PROPANE ODOR. I STEPPED OUTSIDE THE VAN AND DISCOVERED THE DAMAGED PANEL WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR AS LOW-PRESSURE PROPANE WAS LEAKING INTO THE AIR RIGHT BEHIND THE REAR TIRE. I SHUT OFF THE PROPANE AND REPAIRED THE DAMAGE LATER AFTER RETURNING HOME.    I'M THANKFUL IT DID NOT START A FIRE OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE TO MY VAN.    I'M UPLOADING A PHOTO THAT SHOWS THE LOCATION OF THIS PANEL BEHIND THE REAR WHEELS ON PASSENGER SIDE. ALSO INCLUDING PHOTOS OF AN UNDAMAGED LP FILL PANEL FROM THE SIDE AND FROM THE REAR. THE LAST UPLOADED PHOTO IS THE DAMAGED LP FILL PANEL ON MY 2013 AIRSTREAM INTERSTATE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT SHOWING THE MISSING COVER PANEL AND MISSING LP QUICK-CONNECT FITTING.",
