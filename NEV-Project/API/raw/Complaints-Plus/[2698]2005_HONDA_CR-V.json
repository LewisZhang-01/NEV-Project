I noticed this problem after heavy rains, first my windows stopped rolling up and down, then I began noticed a burring/melting plastic smell coming from the drivers door. I took the door apart and tracked the smell down to the power master switch. After inspecting the switch, it was indeed the switch that melted on the circuit board. It seems to have damaged the driver   wiring door harness as well, also like the current recall states. All just as described in the current safety recall which I have attached below.  **Safety Recall: 2002-06 CR-V Driver\u2019s Power Window Switch (Only VINs that start with SHS) ''under severe conditions, water or other liquid may enter the driver\u2019s window and reach the power window master switch on the door panel. Liquid in the switch can damage the switch\u2019s printed circuit board (PCB), causing the switch to fail. In rare cases, the damaged PCB creates a short circuit that overheats the switch connectors and melts them, leading to a possible fire.''  All affected vehicles, even those previously repaired under S/B 12-067, must have the driver's power window switch replaced under the current recall.",

WE USE THE HEADLIGHTS BOTH DURING THE DAY (FOR SAFETY) AND OF COURSE AT NIGHT. WE'VE TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF REPLACEMENT LAMPS, BUT NONE SEEM TO CHANGE THE PATTERN OF LAMP LIFE.  MOST RECENTLY, I'VE REPLACED THE LOW BEAM HEADLAMPS FOUR TIMES (2 EACH SIDE) WITHIN THE PAST 6 MONTHS.  LAST NIGHT WHEN TESTED AFTER REPLACEMENT, THE PASSENGER SIDE LAMP ONLY GLOWED (DUE TO A BAD GROUND CONNECTION?) AND MYSTERIOUSLY, THE BRIGHT BEAM LAMP ON THE SAME SIDE HAD ALSO QUIT WORKING. I HAVE DRIVEN APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION MILES IN OTHER VEHICLES OVER THE PAST 27 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH SUCH FREQUENCY.  BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY AND SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS DUE TO THE UNEXPECTED RECURRENCES, I HAVE NO CHOICE NOW BUT TO ASK THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM.  RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS ENOUGH PROBLEM WITH OTHER MODEL YEARS OF THE SAME VEHICLE THAT IT HAS GENERATED SAFETY RECALLS.

I FEEL THAT THIS PROBLEM IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AS AT HIGHER SPEEDS WHEN THE VEHICLE SHUDDERS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL. *TR",

MY PROBLEM/CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A KNOWN RECALL FOR A EXTREMELY SIMILAR ISSUE ON 2002 THRU 2004 CR-V MODELS.    THAT RECALLS SUMMARY STATES: \"DUE TO TENSION FROM THE COMBINATION SWITCH WIRING HARNESS, WEAR ON THE SURFACE OF THE ELECTRICAL TERMINAL CAN OCCUR, YIELDING COPPER OXIDE, WHICH INCREASES ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE. INCREASED ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE MAY CAUSE THE TERMINAL ENDS TO MELT WITHIN THE WIRING HARNESS CONNECTOR.\"    THE CONSEQUENCE LISTED ON THIS RECALL IS: \"IF THE TERMINAL ENDS MELT WITHIN THE WIRING HARNESS CONNECTOR, THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS MAY BECOME INOPERATIVE, REDUCING DRIVER VISIBILITY AND INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.\"    BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE, IT SEEMS THE RECALL LISTED ABOVE SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE 2005 CR-V MODELS AS WELL.  WE'VE LOOKED AT CURRENT RECALLS FOR OUR VEHICLE UNDER THE HONDA OWNERS SITE AND THERE ARE NONE LISTED FOR OUR VIN... ?  HONDA MAY WANT TO RE-VISIT THIS RECALLS COVERAGE BEFORE ANY OTHER 2005 CR-V OWNER'S HEADLIGHTS GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE DRIVING... THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN!  *TR",

HE ADVISED ME TO CALL HONDA BECAUSE THE CAR IS DEFECTIVE SINCE IT WAS NEW. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY SAID TO BRING TO A DIFFERENT DEALER THAN THE ONE THAT I WENT ON THE FIRST INCIDENT. I WENT TO A DEALER AND AGAIN COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, PAID $220 FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THEY SAID THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY PARTS OF THE DRIVETRAIN, I CHECKED ON THE WEBSITE AND FOUND ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEM POSTED ON THE CRV FORUM /BLOG.

BEFORE STOP SIGN, I RELEASED THE ACCELERATOR AND STARTED TO BRAKE, AS USUAL IT  STOPPED BEFORE THE STOP SIGN, BUT THAT DAY IT DID NOT. AT THE MOMENT I REALIZED I COULD NOT STOP THE CAR, I WAS THINKING TO CROSS ROAD, BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACT I GOT HIT BY THE CAR WHO TRAVELED ON THE ROAD PERPENDICULAR TO MY DIRECTION.  THIS ACCIDENT WAS CONSIDERED AS MY MISTAKE. SINCE I DID NOT HAVE COLLISION INSURANCE AND THE CAR WAS TOTALED WHICH IS THE BIG FINANCIAL LOSS (ACTUAL MARKET VALUE ESTIMATED IN $20K) IN MY LIFE. AT THE SAME TIME I SUFFERED THE BURNING ON ARM FROM THE AIRBAG POPUP AND FREQUENT NOISE ON EARS. UNTIL TODAY I STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH INSURANCE COMPANY ON MEDIAL COVERAGE.    I AM THE CAREFUL DRIVER AND NEVER HAVE HAD ANY ACCIDENT CAUSED BY MYSELF. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY HAPPEN ON THE DAY AT THE TIME.

ONCE THIS OCCURRED ON THE HIGHWAY (IN 2006) AND AGAIN THIS WEEK (2007) ON A BUSY ROAD.  WHEN THE CAR SHUTS OFF, THE GREEN KEY ICON IN THE DASH FLASHES.      LUCKILY BOTH TIMES I WAS ABLE TO COAST OUT OF TRAFFIC, SHIFT INTO PARK AND RESTART.  I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESTART IMMEDIATELY, BUT IT'S A REALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING 65 MPH AND YOUR CAR SHUTS ITSELF OFF. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED I HAD ABOUT 40,000 MILES ON THE CAR.  NOW I HAVE NEARLY 60,000.  OTHERWISE, THE CRV IS IN PERFECT CONDITION.    I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON HONDA CRV IGNITION SWITCHES IN 2002, AND THE DESCRIPTION SOUNDED IDENTICAL TO THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING.  I THINK THAT THEY HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM YET.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE A YEAR AGO, BUT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY SUSPECTED IT WAS CELL PHONE INTERFERENCE WITH THE IGNITION SWITCH.  IF SO, THAT'S A BIG FLAW BECAUSE...WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE IN THEIR PURSE IN THE CAR?",

I CALLED HONDA AND EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT MY SAFETY IN THIS CAR BECAUSE THE POSITION OF THE TURN SIGNAL SO HIGH ON THE CAR AND THE CLEAR LENS -- I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE DESIGN OF THE CR-V AND THEY GOT APPROVAL FOR THE DESIGN SO THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY.

I WAS SLOWING DOWN FOR THE UPCOMING INTERSECTION, WHEN SUDDENLY THE CAR STARTED SPEEDING OUT OF CONTROL AND THE BRAKES COULD NOT STOP MY CAR FROM  SLAMMING INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  AFTER THE CRASH, THE WOMAN I HIT PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THE CAR REVVED WILDLY.  THIS WAS LATER NOTED BY THE WOMAN I HIT, AS WELL.  IN DESPERATION I TURNED THE KEY OFF AND LET THE CAR ROLL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE FIREMEN DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY FOR SAFETY.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER CAME, HE RECONNECTED THE BATTERY CABLES AND THE CAR STARTED ITSELF UP AND BEGAN TO REV.  THE DRIVER SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.  I HAVE HIS NAME AND NUMBER.  THE AIRBAG NEVER DEPLOYED AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO ONLY RECEIVE WHIPLASH AND MY DOG SEEMS OK.  THE OTHER DRIVER HAS BACK PROBLEMS BUT WAS FORTUNATELY DRIVING A NISSAN XTERRA THAT DID NOT GET NEARLY THE DAMAGE MY CAR RECEIVED.  I AM JUST SO THANKFUL THAT MY CHILDREN WERE NOT IN THE CAR, AND THAT THERE WERE NO PEDESTRIANS OR CHILDREN IN FRONT OF ME.  *NM",

IT DOESN'T MATTER OF I ACCELERATE OR DRIVE AT A STEADY SPEED, THE PTTR IS THERE.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I DROVE AT 70 MPH ON I-10, WHICH IS A 4-LANE ROAD, 2 LANES ON EACH DIRECTION (NORTH OF TALLAHASSEE), I WAS ON THE LEFT LANE, THEN TOOK MY HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL. IT STARTED TO DRIFT TO THE RIGHT AFTER TWO SECONDS. AND THEN BETWEEN 2 TO 3 SECONDS LATER, MY V WAS ON THE RIGHT LANE. I HAD TO GRAB THE WHEEL AND PULLED IT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE ROAD OTHERWISE IT WOULD GO INTO A DITCH OR HIT A TREE.  DID THE SAME TEST AS ABOVE, EXCEPT I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL (LET THE V CRUISE ON ITS INERTIA) AT THE SAME TIME I TOOK MY HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL. THE PTTR REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, AFTER 7-8 SECONDS IT STARTED TO DRIFT TO THE RIGHT. THIS IS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL.  3 TRIPS TO HONDA DEALER IN TALLAHASSEE BUT THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. ON THE FOURTH TRIP, THEY SAID THERE IS NO PTTR. I INSISTED THE PROBLEM DID NOT GO AWAY, AND THEY SAID THEY TRIED EVERYTHING (SWAP FRONT TIRES, ALIGNMENT, TSB, SUB FRAME) WITHIN ALIGNMENT AND NOTHING THEY CAN DO ANY MORE. THEY ADMITTED THERE WAS PTTR THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT IT IN, BUT NOW THEY SAID IT IS NORMAL.  I CHECKED IN CR-V FORUMS OF EDMUNDS.COM (AND SOME OTHER SITE) AND I FOUND THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, AND OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. ONE VEHICLE EVEN HAD 2 FRONT SUSPENSION REPLACED FROM AN UNAFFECTED CR-V TO GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED. HONDA DID ISSUED A TSB FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT IT DID NOT FIX IT, OR JUST TEMPORALLY FIXED FOR A FEW MONTHS (ACCORDING TO SOME PEOPLE IN THE FORUMS).

I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER 3 TIMES FOR REALIGNMENT, TIRE ROTATION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WITH NO IMPROVEMENT AT ALL. THE ALIGNMENT READ-OUTS ARE FINE.  ON A FLAT SURFACE GOING 35-40 MPH, NOT HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL, THE VEHICLE CHANGES LANES WITHIN 4 SECONDS. HONDA SAYS 6 SECONDS IS ALLOWABLE. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND I FEEL I'M DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE.*AK",
