ADAPTIVE CRUISE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES ALMOST CAUSING A REAR-END ACCIDENT BY OVERCOMPENSATING.  THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE ON A 2000 MILE TRIP IN DIFFERENT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS.  IN CONTACTING MY DEALER, THEY CALLED GM AND WERE TOLD IT COULD NOT BE FIXED BECAUSE OF EXTENSIVE SUPPOSED CHANGES TO THE VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, OTHER  GM VEHICLES HAVE A SHUTOFF THAT WOULD ELIMINATE ADAPTIVE CRUISE AND LET YOU NORMALLY OPERATE CRUISE CONTROL.  I WAS THEN TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT I WOULD NEED TO CONTACT GM DIRECTLY.  THE CASE NUMBER IS 8-4468390871.  IN PURSUING THIS WITH SEVERAL  GM REPRESENTATIVES,  THEY CLAIM THERE IS NO FIX WITHOUT EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN SOFTWARE, WIRING, AND PROGRAMMING.  BUT ALSO REVEALED THEY RECOGNIZED IT IS A PROBLEM AND HAVE PROVIDED A SHUTOFF ON FUTURE GM YUKON DENALI VEHICLES.  IRONICALLY, THIS FIX IS ALREADY ON A BUICK ENVISION, ACADIA, AND POSSIBLY  A CHEVY EQUINOX.  GM'S RESPONSE IS TO SPEND MY MONEY ON A NEW VEHICLE TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM.  MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 2300 MILES ON IT.   I CONSIDER THIS ADAPTIVE CRUISE FEATURE AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN WITH DRIVERS NOT EXPECTING THE RADICAL BRAKING AS WELL AS OTHER DRIVERS NOT EXPECTING IT, THUS POSSIBLY CAUSING CHAIN REACTION CRASHES.",
