ALONG WITH DOG TRACKING DOWN THE ROAD, TIRES ARE BEING WORN UNEVENLY AND EXTREMELY FAST AND HAVING TO BE REPLACED 10X AS FAST AS THEY NORMALLY WOULD. THE MAJOR ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT BECAUSE THE AXLES ARE INSTALLED CROOKED IT IS PUTTING EXCESSIVE STRESS ON THE WHEEL BEARING. AT THIS TIME 3 OR THE 4 WHEEL BEARINGS HAVE FAILED, ALL WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD WITH EQUIPMENT ON. THE WORST WAS THE 2ND WHEEL BEARING FAILURE. I WAS DRIVING 60 MPH DOWN A STATE ROUTE, LOADING WITH A 14K LB BULLDOZER, WHEN THE BEARING FAILED, CAUSING THE HUB AND SURRENDERING PARTS TO GET EXTREMELY HOT. WITHOUT WARNING 2 TIRES BLEW OUT. THE TRAILER WENT SWAYING SIDE TO SIDE, ALMOST HITTING ONCOMING CARS. VERY FORTUNATE FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SLOWED DOWN AND PULLED OFF THE ROAD. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS. THE MANUFACTURER (GATORMADE TRAILERS OUT OF SOMERSET KY) HAS DONE AND REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. I'VE PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET TO REPLACE AND REPAIR THE TIRES, BEARINGS, AND AXLE. BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. GATORMADE REFUSES TO HELP",
