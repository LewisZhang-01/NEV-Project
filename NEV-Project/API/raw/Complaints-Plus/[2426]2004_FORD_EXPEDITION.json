After getting it home and not driving for a period of time it can be started and moved with no issue. Drive to town no problem parked it to take care of some business and when I went to leave I couldn't back out of the parking place. Got it home and let it sit again. Needed to move it out of the way all was good started it and moved it across the yard and backed it in no problem. Had K&O auto look at it and was told it needs a transmission. I see allot of complaints about this issue from others without Ford being held responsible to correct the problem.  Nice vehical said I can't afford to get it fixed, now driving a 500.00 used vehicle to get around, it is an eye sore but gets me around ok. Would rather enjoy the expidition if Ford would fix the issue that 1000's have had.",

EXPEDITION PURCHASED 3/04  PROBLEMS:  DOOR RATTLES,   BRAKE FAILURE        NO FORD PRODUCT TO DATE HAS REQUIRED AS MANY SERVICE CALLS AS THIS 2004 EXPEDITION.  THE DOOR RATTLES HAVE NEVER BEEN TOTALLY FIXED AFTER7 ATTEMPTS.        I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE ADVANCE TRAC SYSTEM THAT HAS CAUSED A BRAKE FAILURE ON TWO OCCASIONS. I DO NOT INTENT TO WAIT AROUND FOR A THIRD TIME.       LAST SUMMER, I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 50 M.P.H. WHEN APPROACHING A LIGHT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. THE BRAKES FAILED.  THE PEDAL PULSATED AS IF I WAS ON ICE, BUT THE PAVEMENT WAS PERFECTLY DRY.  I AVOIDED A MASSIVE REAR END COLLISION BY TAKING EVASIVE ACTION, AND DRIVING OVER A BERM.  THE BRAKES ACTED AS IF THEY HAD ABOUT 10 % OF THEIR STOPPING POWER.    WHEN I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT PAOLI FORD, THEY SUGGESTED I RESTART THE VEHICLE AND TURN OFF THE ADVANCED TRAC BUTTON.  THIS DID RESTORE THE BRAKES. I DROPPED THE TRUCK OFF  AND THEY REPLACED SOME YAW SENSOR PARTS UNDER WARRANTY, AND DECLARED IT SAFE TO DRIVE.         THIS SAME BRAKE FAILURE HAS NOW HAPPENED AGAIN!  THE MESSAGE CENTER INDICATED 2 ADVTRAC FAULTS, BUT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT THE FAULT CODES SCROLLED OFF THE SYSTEM BY THE TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO TEST IT.  THEY SUGGESTED THAT I DRIVE IT UNTIL THE BRAKES FAIL AGAIN.           I WILL NOT SUBJECT MY FAMILY TO THE DANGER OF THIS SITUATION AGAIN!  I DO NOT INTENT TO WAIT AROUND FOR THE NEXT TIME THE BRAKES FAIL.    FORD HAS DESIGNED THEIR TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM TO REMOVE BRAKING POWER WHEN THERE IS A POTENTIAL ROLLOVER. HOWEVER, WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE YAW SENSOR, IT CAN REMOVE THE BRAKING POWER WHILE TRAVELING STRAIGHT ON A DRY ROAD.  FORD HAS ELIMINATED ROLLOVER LAWSUITS, BUT CAUSED A BRAKE FAILURE IN THE PROCESS.   *JB",

YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME TRACTION AS THE TIRE SET AT A LOWER PRESS.  FORD SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE TMPS WORK AS INTENDED WITH THE CORRECT PRESS STATED ON THE DRIVER DOOR. *AK",
