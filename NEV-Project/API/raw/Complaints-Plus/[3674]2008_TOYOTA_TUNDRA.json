Bed has rusted through at one location, rust is visible at another and the other two locations the paint is bubbling up.  Contacted my local Toyota dealership (9/2020) and forwarded to the collision/repair shop manager.  He supposedly sent an email to a district/area manager with pictures.  I contacted him a couple weeks later and he said he hadn\u2019t heard back and would sent it to another individual.  I asked for the original email along with the new one.  Original email was never furnished.  Couple more weeks passed and I followed up yet again.  Was told my vehicle was too old and nothing could be done.  No official letter from Toyota, just a verbal statement.  This rust will eventually cause a lack of support in the bolt area and may be an extreme safety issue while driving the truck and/or those driving beside or behind the vehicle if/when the bed disconnects from the frame.   Incident date is the reported date to dealership.  I am positive it had been ongoing under the bed mat quite prior to that date.",

SINCE THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE PUMPS DURING REGULAR MAINTENANCE INSTEAD OF NOT DOING NOTHING AND HOPE IT DOES NOT OCCUR. EVEN IF I REPLACE THE PUMPS WHAT SAYS IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I LOST CONFIDENCE IN MY TRUCK AND AM AFRAID IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN.",

THE EPA SHOULD BE EXEMPTING MINOR DISCREPENCIES IN THEIR EMISSIONS LAWS WHILE WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS TO DEVELOP SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS.

I TRIED RESTARTING AND IT WOULD NOT. I CHECKED ALL THE INDICATERS AND EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL. FUEL GAUGE REGISTERED 1/4 FULL WHICH WOULD EQUATE TO APPROXIMATELY 5-7 GALLONS. AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL EFFORTS TO RESTART THE TRUCK I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK. WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HE SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE OUT OF GAS!!!...I SHOWED HIM THE FUEL GAGE INDICATOR SHOWING THE 1/4 LEVEL AND HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DAD ALSO HAD A TUNDRA AND HAD EXPERIENCED ISSUES WITH THE FUEL TANK FLOAT HANGING GIVING FALSE READINGS OF WHAT THE ACTUAL FUEL LEVEL WAS. HE SUGGESTED WE TAKE THE TRUCK TO THE NEAREST GAS STATION AND PUT A FEW GALLONS IN PRIOR TO TAKING THE TRUCK TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. ONCE WE ADDED SOME GASOLINE THE TRUCK STARTED RIGHT UP. I WAS SHOCKED AND UPSET FOR A NUMBER OF REASON. 1. I JUST PAID A TOW SERVICE $75 DOLLARS FOR TAKING ME DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT A HALF BLOCK TO A LOCAL CONVENIENT STORE TO PUT GAS IN MY TRUCK. 2.

I SPENT ALOT OF MONEY ON A TRUCK TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS, NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE TRUCK   STUCK IN LIMP MODE BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO REPAIR, TWO THOUSAND IN JUST PARTS, TOYOTA IS CHARGING PEOPLE 4 TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM WHEN IT SHOULD BE RECALLED AT NO COST TO   THE CONSUMER DUE TO THE POOR ENGINEERING AND FAULTY DESIGN ON THE SECONDARY AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM PUMPS AND SWITCHING VALVES......I AM VERY SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED IN TOYOTA FOR THEY HAVE ALWAYS BACKED UP THERE PRODUCT BUT THIS IS A POOR PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE NOT BACKING UP WHEN THEY MOST CERTAINLY SHOULD STAND BEHIND IT. ALSO THIS SYSTEM SHOULD BE REDESIGNED TO PUT ON CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BUT SHOULD NOT  PUT VEHICLE IN LIMP MODE IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY ETC.....  ALSO THE COST AND PROBLEMS OF THIS UNNEEDED SYSTEM IS OUTRAGEOUS, ALL THIS SYSTEM DOES IS FORCE AIR INTO  THE EXHAUST FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MINUTES OF ENGINE RUNNING AT STARTUP. I SWORE BY TOYOTA FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, NOT ANY MORE , WISH I GOT A CHEVY.  *TR",

NEXT I GOT ON THE GROUND AND NOTICED RIGHT AWAY THAT THE FRONT STRUT HAD SNAPPED IN HALF.     I CONSIDERED THIS TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM, SO I CONTACTED MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS... \"HOW MANY MILES ARE ON YOUR TUNDRA\"? I REPLIED 46,500. THE NEXT RESPONSE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING - WITH NO OTHER INQUIRY INTO THE SITUATION, THE TECHNICIAN SAID, \"WELL, YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE 3YR / 36,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THE STRUTS SO YOU CAN HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED TO OUR SHOP AND WE CAN REPLACE IT FOR YOU\". I'M THINKING WOW!!! THAT'S THE RESPONSE AFTER I JUST TELL A TOYOTA SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT A FACTORY PART JUST RANDOMLY FAILED AND COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. NEXT I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL HOTLINE FOR TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE. THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WOULD BE DOCUMENTED AND THANKED ME FOR CALLING IN WITH MY CONCERN. THIS IS MY 3RD TUNDRA AND I'VE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE LIKE THIS BEFORE.     ALL IN ALL, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT A MAJOR COMPONENT LIKE A STRUT FAILED UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS. EVEN MORE DISAPPOINTING IS THE REACTION I RECEIVED FROM BOTH MY LOCAL DEALER AND THE NATIONAL CUSTOMER HOTLINE.

WHEN THE WATER IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SWITCHING VALVES. THE VEHICLE WILL LOOSE SPEED RAPIDLY ON A MEDIUM GRADE WITH NO ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. THE CRUISE CONTROL CAUSES THE TRANMISSION TO DOWNSHIFT REPEATEDLY TRYING TO ACCELERATE. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AT HIGH SPEED. IN ADDITION THE VEHICLE STABLIZATION CONTROL IS DISABLED. THIS CONDITION ALSO SHORT CIRCUITS AND DISABLES 4W DRIVE AND CAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON. THE INABILITY TO MAINTAIN SPEED OR TO ACCELERATE CREATES A VERY HAZARDOUS CONDITION.  I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED TWICE AT A COST OF $1600.  THE DEALER HAS INFORMED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR BECAUSE OF A DESIGN FLAW. TOYOTA ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM IN A SERVICE BULLETIN TO THE DEALERSHIP (T-SB-039-08 REV 2 DATED 10/28/08). THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT THE DEALERSHIP CLAIM IT HAS NO AUTHORIZATION FROM TOYOTA TO IMPLEMENT IT. AS A RESULT I AM  FORCED TO DRIVE  A VEHICLE THAT BECOMES UNSAFE WHEN IT RAINS.  *TR",

I WAS UNDER MY TRUCK DOING A GENERAL INSPECTION AND NOTICED THAT MY LEFT REAR TRD BILSTIEN SHOCK WAS LEAKING. I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WITHOUT HESITATION THEY ORDERED THE PART WITHOUT EVEN SEEING THE TRUCK.

A FEW DAYS LATTER I NOTICED A KNOCK COMING FROM MY TRUCK AND WHEN I HAD ISOLATED THE KNOCK I IDENTIFIED IT AS THE LEFT STRAP ON MY TRD SWAY BAR KIT.

THE EXTENSIVE TRAVEL OF THE SHOCK CAUSED TOO MUCH STRESS ON THE STRAP OF THE SWAY BAR KIT AND IN-TURN THE STRAP FAILED AND SPLIT IN HALF EXPOSING THE RUBBER BUSHING (I HAVE PICTURES OF THIS).

THE VEHICLE BEGAN ACCELERATING HIGHER AND HIGHER ON ITS OWN SENDING ME AND MY DAUGHTER ON A 70 MPH RIDE. THE ONLY WAY I COULD STOP WAS TO PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE AND PUT VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL, EVENTUALLY THE PEDAL BECAME UNSTUCK AND I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO MY PLACE OF WORK LESS THAN A MILE AWAY AND PARKED IT. I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY TOWED THE VEHICLE IN. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED AFTER THE SAFETY RECALL. TOYOTA AT THIS TIME CUT THE GAS PEDAL IN TWO  AND ADDED CHEAPER FLOOR MATS. THEY SAID THIS WAS THE PROBLEM. TODAY I WAS TAKING MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND WAS GOING UP A HILL. I DEPRESSED THE GAS PEDAL AND HAD NO ACCELERATION. I GENTLY ROLLED BACK DOWN THE HILL AND GOT THE VEHICLE ON THE LEVEL AND THEN TOOK ANOTHER ROUTE. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE. ITS NOT THE FLOOR MATS OR THE SIZE OF THE PEDAL IT IS IN THE WIRING, COMPUTER, OR SOMETHING. BOTH INCIDENTS WERE FORTUNATE THAT NO VEHICLE WAS IN FRONT OF ME OR BEHIND ME. I CALLED TOYOTA TODAY ABOUT THIS SECOND INCIDENT AND ALL THEY COULD TELL ME WAS TO CALL THE 1 800 NUMBER. I EXPLAINED I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE, KNOWING THAT IM PUTTING MYSELF AND OTHERS ON THE HIGHWAY IN HARMS WAY. THIS IS MY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION SO UNFORTUNATELY I CANT JUST STOP DRIVING IT. *TR",

THE EVENT WAS EXPERIENCED WITHIN 10 MINUTES/3.5 MILES AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP FOLLOWING DEALER-SERVICE WORK THAT INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TOYOTA RECALL TO INSERT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL SHIM (SSC).  THIS IS THE ONLY SUCH EVENT EXPERIENCED TO DATE WITH THIS TRUCK.    THE EVENT  WITH THE VEHICLE PARKED AND THE ENGINE IDLING NORMALLY (APPROXIMATELY 800 RPM), I PLACED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE IN PREPARATION OF SHIFTING THE TRANSMISSION FROM PARK TO DRIVE.  MY FOOT WAS WELL CENTERED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND NOT IN CONTACT AT ALL WITH THE THROTTLE PEDAL.  THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN ENGINE SPEED AT THIS POINT.  I THEN SHIFTED THE TRANSMISSION FROM PARK TO DRIVE.  AS SOON AS THE DRIVE POSITION WAS ENGAGED, WITH MY FOOT UNCHANGED FROM ITS FIRM POSITION ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE ENGINE SPEED IMMEDIATELY WENT TO FULL THROTTLE.  AS I HEARD THE ENGINE SPEED UP, I APPLIED FULL PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE TO HOLD THE VEHICLE IN ITS STATIONARY POSITION.  THE REAR WHEELS BROKE LOOSE FROM THE PAVEMENT AND BEGAN SPINNING; HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE REMAINED STATIONARY, HELD BY THE BRAKING OF THE FRONT WHEELS.  FORTUNATELY, THE PAVEMENT WAS WET, WHICH FACILITATED THE REAR WHEELS LOSING TRACTION WITH THE PAVEMENT.  I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE IGNITION OFF WHILE THE DRIVE POSITION WAS STILL ENGAGED.  ONCE THE ENGINE WAS SHUT DOWN, I PLACED THE TRANSMISSION IN THE PARK POSITION.  AS I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO PLACE MY FOOT ON THE THROTTLE PEDAL BEFORE THE EVENT OCCURRED, IT WAS NOT MECHANICAL IN NATURE AND CAN ONLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN ELECTRICAL/CONTROL ISSUE. *TR",

I HAVE A FLAWLESS DRIVING RECORD AND CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A VERY CAREFUL DRIVER.  I AM CONFIDENT THIS WAS NOT A DRIVER ERROR.  I WAS IN A BUSY WALMART PARKING LOT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE STORE SO I WAS NATURALLY BEING CAUTIOUS. *TR",

MAYBE BECAUSE OF SAFETY PROBLEMS OR THAT IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO A SHORT CIRCUIT AND UNINTENDED ACCELERATION AS PROFESSOR GILBERT HAD DEMONSTRATED ON ABC WITH WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITH A SHORT CIRCUIT IN SOME TOYOTA VEHICLES.  SOMEONE FROM TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS THAT WAS VISITING MY DEALERSHIP PERSONALLY INVESTIGATED MY 2008 TUNDRA'S SPEED SENSOR WIRES WHICH ON ONE SIDE HAD COMPLETELY FAILED (SNAPPED COMPLETELY THROUGH) AND WAS FAILING ON THE OTHER SIDE (PARTIALLY BROKEN THROUGH) AT THE SAME SPOT.  TOYOTA CHOSE TO REPAIR BOTH BUT RATHER CLASSIFIED THE REPAIRS AS A 'COURTESY REPLACEMENT' VERSUS UNDER THE VEHICLES WARRANTY.  THIS I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF WAS DONE TO KEEP IT OFF THE BOOKS BACK AT HEADQUARTERS AND UNDER WRAPS.  THIS HAPPENED IN JAN OF 2010.  OTHER INDICATIONS THIS IS WIDER SPREAD BUT UNREALIZED AS TO BEING A DEFECT PROBLEM: 1) THE DEALERSHIP HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD A HARD TIME RETRIEVING REPLACEMENT PARTS, PROBABLY LOW ON STOCK DUE TO OTHER REPLACEMENTS.  2) THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP HAD REPAIRED ANOTHER TUNDRA AT THE SAME LOCATION FOR THE SAME PROBLEM RIGHT BEFORE MINE, WHICH I HEARD ABOUT THROUGH A CONTACT.  3) INTERNET SEARCH INDICATIONS.  NOTE:  AT FIRST GLANCE A TORN OR SPLIT WIRE MAY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRIS OR IN THE CASE OF A VEHICLE CRASH IF WIRE ALREADY WAS EXHIBITED PROBLEMS MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN IMPACT IF DISCOVERED AFTER AN IMPACT.  BECAUSE OF THESE TWO REASONS IF THIS PROBLEM IS A DEFECT IT MAY EXPLAIN WHY IT'S NOT REPORTED SO READILY.  THAT'S MY FEAR.  FROM MY FINDINGS I'M CONVINCED WHAT IS CREATING THIS DEFECT IS IN DESIGN. THE WIRE PASSES THROUGH A HARNESS WHICH IS CLAMPED DOWN TO THE FRAME AND THE A-ARM WHICH PIVOTS UP AND DOWN TUGGING ON THE WIRE WHICH IS ALSO NEAR THE HOT MANIFOLD AND AFTER TIME THE CONSTANT BENDING AND TUGGING BREAKS DOWN THE SPEED SENSOR WIRE. *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL, THE ENGINE OVER-REVVED, AND THE PEDAL FINALLY RETURNED TO THE NORMAL POSITION. WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALER I WAS TOLD THAT IT MUST HAVE STUCK ON THE FLOORMAT, BUT THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. THE FLOORMAT WAS NO WHERE NEAR THE PEDAL. I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS HAPPENING AND THE FACT THE  PEDAL FELT LIKE IT HAD PULLED ITSELF DOWN MORE THAN WHAT I WAS PUSHING ON IT. I ALSO COMPLAINED OF THE PEDAL BEING HARD TO PUSH AT TAKE OFF AND ALWAYS JOLTING FORWARD AT TAKE OFF DUE TO THE PRESSURE NEEDED TO PUSH THE ACCELERATOR. THE DEALER AGAIN STATED IT HAD TO BE THE FLOORMAT AND ONLY DOCUMENTED THE PROBLEM OF THE PEDAL BEING HARD TO PUSH. WHEN THEY RETURNED THE VEHICLE THEY SAID THE PEDAL WAS FINE AND THAT IT WAS NORMAL TO HAVE TO PUSH HARD ON IT DUE TO THE FACT IT DID NOT OPERATE WITH A CABLE ANYMORE. I CONTACTED TOYOTA SEVERAL TIMES VIA EMAIL SINCE THE LATEST RECALL AND FINALLY RECEIVED A CALL TODAY FROM THEM. THE WOMAN WHO CALLED SAID TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER TO BE REPAIRED. WHEN I ASKED HER IF THE INCIDENT WITH THE STUCK ACCELERATOR WOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY TOYOTA , SHE STATED THAT THERE ONLY ACTION WOULD BE THE RECALL FIX AND TO CONTACT THE DEALER.I FEEL TOYOTA OR AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY SHOULD CHECK THE VEHICLE BEFORE TOYOTA IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT, BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL THAT THERE SHIM WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM. I BELIEVE IT IS A PROBLEM OTHER THAN THE PEDAL JUST BEING STUCK. MY VEHICLE ONLY HAD APPROX. 8,000 MILES AT THE TIME. *TR",

THIS CRACK WENT ACROSS THE LOWER PORTION OF THE WINDSHIELD AND CURVED DOWN TOWARD THE DASH. I CALLED THE DEALER TO INQUIRE ABOUT REPAIR, AND WAS TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT BUILT WITH A HEATED WINDSHIELD SO I ELECTED TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF WINTER TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER I CAME OUT TO GO TO WORK, STARTED THE VEHICLE, AND TURNED ON THE HEATED MIRRORS. I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND WENT TO OPEN MY GATE AND FEED THE DOG, UPON RETURNING TO THE TRUCK I SMELLED A BURNING ELECTRICAL ODOR. AT THIS TIME I NOTICED A FLASHING AND A FLAME COMING FROM THE LOWER PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW SO I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF. I THEN CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY CAME AND TOWED THE VEHICLE IN TO THEIR SHOP. THEY CONTACTED TOYOTA CORPORATE AND WERE TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT BUILT WITH A HEATED WINDSHIELD WHICH IS WHAT THE BUILD SPECIFICATION SHEET STATES. AFTER INVESTIGATING FURTHER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MY TRUCK WAS INDEED BUILT WITH A HEATED WINDSHIELD, WHICH HAD SHORTED OUT FROM THE CRACK AND BURNED THE WINDSHIELD AND THE PASSENGER WIPER BLADE. I AM CONCERNED THAT TOYOTA HAS STATED THAT THIS IS NOT A DESIGN ISSUE AND IT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. HAD I NOT NOTICED THE FLAME COMING FROM MY VEHICLE AND SHUT IT OFF THE OUTCOME OF THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF THE VEHICLE OR A LIFE. IN THE END THE WINDSHIELD WAS REPLACED AND EVERYTHING WORKS. HOPEFULLY THE HEATED MIRRORS ARE NOT ON IF THERE IS EVER A CRASH THAT COMPROMISES THE WINDSHIELD. *TR",
