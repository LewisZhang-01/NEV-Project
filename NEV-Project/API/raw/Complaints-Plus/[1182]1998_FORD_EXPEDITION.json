AND I WAS TRULY AFRAID FOR MY LIFE AND THE OTHERS THAT WERE ON THE ROAD WITH ME.  I HAD TO DRIFT ACROSS A LANE OF TRAFFIC WITH NO POWER TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I PUT THE TRUCK IN PARK AND PUT MY HEAD DOWN, WHEW, AND THE MOTOR POWERED BACK UP AND ALL THE FAILURE LIGHTS WERE OFF.  ONLY AFTER INVESTIGATING ON THE INTERNET TODAY DO I FIND OUT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  AND THE FIX... REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD SEAL! AND POSSIBLE DAMAGED FUSE BOX AND GEM!  NOW WHY DIDN'T THE FORD DEALER HELP REMEDY THIS PROBLEM ONE OF THE MANY TIMES I WAS IN?  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  NEW WINDSHIELD $165 AND THEY COME TO THE HOUSE.

BESIDES THE SPEEDOMETER NOT WORKING OR THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN IT RAINED, THE TRANSMISSION STARTED NOT SHIFTING AT ITS NORMAL ''SHIFTING POINTS'' & THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT ON THE GEAR SHIFTER WOULD FLASH ON & OFF REPEATEDLY. WHEN IT WAS DRY OUT OR IF I USED THE FLOOR HEATER WHEN IT RAIN, IT WOULD RUN OK.

I AM CREATING THIS DEFECT REPORT BECAUSE I BELIEVE MY 1998 FORD EXPEDITION MAY ALSO SUFFER FROM A DEFECT WITH THE FRONT STABILIZER BAR LINK.  THE STABILIZER BAR CONNECTS THE LEFT AND RIGHT FRONT WHEEL CONTROL ARMS AND IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IN CONTROLLING THE PITCH OF THE VEHICLE IN TURNS.  WHEN DRIVING, IF I DRIVE OVER THE SLIGHTEST OF IMPERFECTIONS IN A PAVED ROAD, THE FRONT WHEELS START TO VIBRATE AND I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN TO REGAIN CONTROL AND TO MAKE THE WHEELS RIDE CORRECTLY.  ALSO WHEN EXITING OFF A RAMP FROM A HIGHWAY (MEANING A VERY GRADUALLY RIGHT EXIT, NOT A SHARP RIGHT TURN), THERE IS A LOUD THUMPING SOUND AND THE WHEELS AGAIN SEEM TO LOSE CONTROL AND START TO VIBRATE.  LIKEWISE, WHEN MAKING A SHARP LEFT OR RIGHT TURN, THERE IS A LOUD THUMPING SOUND AND THE WHEEL SEEM TO LOSE CONTROL AND START VIBRATING.  I HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKES TO SLOW THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO REGAIN CONTROL.  THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A MATTER OF GETTING MY 'ALIGNMENT FIXED.'  PLEASE NOTE:  I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS MORE INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA.  THIS BEHAVIOR STARTED ABOUT APRIL 2001.  THIS HAS GRADUALLY GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE.  IT NOW OCCURS EVERY TIME I DRIVE THIS FORD EXPEDITION.  THIS VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.  I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE TO BE UNSAFE, YET I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO AND FROM WORK.  I NOW HAVE TO DRIVE SLOWLY TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS WITH LOSING CONTROL OF THE WHEELS.  FYI - I CALLED YOUR OFFICE AT 1-888-DASH-2-DOT AND FILED A COMPLAINT.  BUT I WASN'T QUITE SURE THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE GOT ALL MY INFORMATION.  SO I AM OPENING THIS REPORT AS A FOLLOW-ON.  THE PREVIOUS DOT IMAGE NUMBER IS 715727, AND I SPOKE TO CAROL.  YOU MAY CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  THANK YOU.*AK (TIRESIZE: P265/70R17)",

THEN I TOLD MY WIFE WHAT THEY SAID AND SHE WAS VERY UPSET WITH THEM ( KORUM FORD ) SHE CALLED AND COMPLAINED  AND GOT VERY ANGRY WITH THEM OVER THE PHONE AND THEY HUNG UP ON HER, SO WE SENT A LETTER TO FORD MOTOR CO . I THEN TOOK THE TIRE TO GOODYEAR AND THEY AT LEAST TREATED ME WITH SOME RESPECT THEY SAID THE TIRE COULD BE SENT OUT FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY WHICH IF IT SHOWED NO DEFECT IN THE TIRE THEN I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE OR THEY COULD SIMPLY DISCOUNT A NEW TIRE BY 50% SINCE IT WAS A QUESTIONABLE CAUSE. THE GOODYEAR DEALER TOLD ME IN HIS OPINION THE TIRE FORD USES IS TOO LIGHT FOR SUCH A BIG TRUCK, THE EXPEDITION FALLS JUST UNDER THE MAXIMUM WEIGHT LIMIT FOR THE TIRE AND SINCE IT IS A TALL VEHICLE IT LEANS A LOT AROUND CORNERS PUTTING A LOT OF STRESS ON THE TIRE.THEN I REMEMBERED THAT WHEN THE TIRE BLEW I HAD JUST COME OUT OF SOME S CURVES IN THE ROAD. WHEN THE TIRE BLEW IT ALSO DAMAGED THE RIM WHICH IS A $350  DOLLAR RIM  AND THE COST OF A NEW TIRE IT WAS ABOUT $500 DOLLARS!! A BIT EXPENCIVE FOR A BLOW OUT . BUT AT LEAST NO ONE WAS HURT !

THE RESULT IS THAT WHEN TRAVELLING OR BEING PARKED ON A DOWN HILL SURFACE THE VEHICLE WILL EITHER NOT START OR RUN OUT OF GAS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A QUARTER TANK OF GASOLINE.  I CONTACTED A FORD DEALER IN GLENDALE WHEN I FIRST EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY ONLY RESPONDED THAT THIS IS THE VEHICLE'S DESIGN.  THE DEALER ALSO PROVIDED ME WITH A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ACKNOWLEDGING FORD'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAS TANK FLUCTUATION PROBLEM.  THE REASON I AM NOW, AND ONCE AGAIN, MAKING THIS AN ISSUE IS THAT I RECENTLY, DUE TO THE GAS TANK FLUCTUATION, RAN OUT OF GAS WHILE DRIVING DOWN HILL, DESPITE A QUARTER TANK READING ON THE GAS GAUGE WHILE TRAVELLING ON A LEVEL SURFACE.  I STRONGLY URGE NHTSA TO PERFORM A SAFETY ANALYSIS ON THIS GAS TANK DEFECT.  A VEHICLE WHICH BECOMES INOPERATIVE WHILE DRIVING DOWN HILL IS TRULY AN UNSAFE VEHICLE.",

TOOK 2 1/2 WEEKS TO GET PARTS IN. ASKED THE DEALER SINCE IT WAS OCCURING MOSTLY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OTHER VEHICLES, I WAS WONDERING IF THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE THE LEFT SIDE ON MINE. ALSO. I WAS TOLD ONLY IF IT BREAKS. DEALER FIXED THE VEHICLE ON FEB. 5, 1999. AFTER DRIVING  FOR 2 DAYS IT BROKE AGAIN. DEALER HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER TORSION BAR AND THAT WAS REPLACED ON FEB. 17,1999.

WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE HAD BEEN DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE TORSION BAR FAILED.  I'VE PLACED 3 CALLS TO FORD CONSUMER RELATIONS, AND RECEIVED NOTHING, NOT EVEN  I'M VERY SORRY, AND NO CORESPONDENCE FROM THEM.   AS TO THE PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL PUMP, EVERY TIME WE GOT DOWN TO 1/4 OF ATANK OF GAS OR LESS AND WOULD COME TO A STOP AND STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR TO PROCEED, THE VEHICLE WOULD STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER ON THREE OCCASIONS, ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG, AND THAT WE SHOULD DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH MORE THAN 1/4 OF A TANK OF GAS. I ASKED THEM TO TEST THE FUEL PUMP TWICE. THEN FINALLY, ON THE THIRD VISIT THE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP BECAUSE THEY FOUND THE FUEL SOCK ON THE PUMP WAS TOO SHORT AND PUMPING FUEL WHEN THE TANK WAS BELOW 1/4 OF A TANK. *AK",
