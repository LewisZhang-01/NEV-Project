I went to my local Honda dealers in Modesto and Stockton, CA. Spoke to their service personnel and they both had no idea what might cause this to happen. I then called Honda customer service and they hadn't heard of this problem. After it happened a few more times I called them again. I voiced my concerns of it happening and causing me to be involved in an accident. Laura, the rep I spoke to, gave me a case number (09698440) to reference should I call again.

I go to press on the accelerator as I normally would and it would not drive, so I pressed on it a little harder as I was turning left since there were cars approaching. My vehicle suddenly jolted, making myself and the kids shift/jump from the force. I then proceeded driving down the road and let go of the accelerator, and my SUV suddenly started to feel like it was slowing itself down instantaneously. It felt like it was trying to make the vehicle's speed go down to 0. I then pressed on the accelerator again to prevent it from happening, but it continued to do so whenever I let go. I had to stop at the school's parking lot and turn off the SUV completely. When I turned it on again and began to drive, it was functioning normally. Since then, it has happened about 3 or 4 times, 1 of which happened on the expressway, which was way scarier. I had to get out of the expressway as it was dangerous.   Just yesterday, I had a separate issue with the SUV that may seem related in retrospect. My SUV did not want to turn on. I experienced all of the dashboard lights flickering, and being unable to start it. It was not the battery because at some times, the radio would turn on, the lights, and the windows/locks would function normally. I was unable to get the vehicle to go to neutral, or anything then on. When the lights were not flickering, it presented me with the smart entry system light problem. Soon after, all the lights on my dashboard turned on and stated there were air bag problem, brake problem, abs problem, and etc... My vehicle is currently being looked at.",

The third row is normally kept folded down, with the middle row belt retracted into ceiling when not in use.  I am left wondering if the geometry of the belt placement is causing mechanical/friction damage, if there are sharp edges in the 2nd row middle belt storage (overhead), or if there was chemical damage to some belts in the factory.

Has been happening several times in the last year. I have taken it in to have the battery checked and it checks fine. The car is not throwing any codes.  This can be particularly dangerous when you are in a median trying to pull across a busy Highway as your car just completely dies on you. Also a problem when you are at a red light and it turns green and everyone starts rolling and your car completely dies, this increases your chance of being rear-ended.  If I manually turn the auto idle stop feature off when I initially turn the car on, this problem does not happen...... but this is every easy to forget as this is an automatic feature when your car is initially started..",

I WAS LEFT STRANDED AT 7PM, IN DARK, WITH 3 SCARED CHILDREN, UNABLE TO ALERT OTHER HOSTILE DRIVERS AROUND ME BY TURNING ON FLASHERS. AFTER NOT BEING ABOUT TO PUSH VEHICLE OUT  WAY OF HEAVY TRAFFIC, I WAS FORCED TO CALL MY INSURANCE COMPANY FOR ASSISTANCE WHICH PROVED TO BE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE DUE TO THE HORNS AND DEROGATORY LANGUAGE OF OTHER DRIVERS AND AS A RESULT MY CHILDREN HAVING AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN IN THE BACK SEAT.

SO BASICALLY THIS FUEL SAVING FEATURE TURNS OUT TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING STRANDED IN A PARKING LOT , I WAS STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY.

THE VENT TEMPERATURE VARIES CONSIDERABLY BASED ON THE ENGINE RPM.  WHILE ACCELERATING THE TEMPERATURE IS WARM / HOT BUT WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC OR STOPPED THE TEMPERATURE CAN DROP 80 DEGREES OR MORE IN 1-2 MINUTES.      BASED ON THIS DATA, I MADE TWO SEPARATE APPOINTMENTS TO HAVE THE PILOT SERVICED UNDER WARRANTY AT MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER.    THE WEATHER ON THE 2ND VISIT WAS COLD (-17 DEGREES F).  THEY 'VERIFIED THE COMPLAINT' AND FOUND THAT THE VENT TEMPERATURE FROM A FULLY WARMED UP ENGINE WAS 28 DEGREES (YES, BELOW FREEZING!).  THEY SAID THEY HAVE ANOTHER PILOT IN THEIR SHOP THAT DOES THE SAME THING THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MINE AND CONSIDERED MINE AS FUNCTIONING 'NORMAL'.       THEY DID NOT DO ANY DIAGNOSTIC WORK AND REFUSED TO DO ANY WORK, EVEN SIMPLE WORK SUCH AS TRYING TO FLUSH THE HEATER CORE OR REMOVE ANY AIR FROM THE SYSTEM.  THEY STATED THAT HONDA PUT IN AN UNDERSIZED HEATER CORE IN THE PILOT AND THEREFORE THEY WERE NOT GOING TO WASTE THEIR TIME TRYING TO FIX. SINCE I LIVE IN CHICAGO THERE ARE 5 MONTHS OF COLD WEATHER SO I DO NOT CONSIDER A LACK OF HEAT A MINOR INCONVENIENCE NOR AN ACCEPTABLE TO LIVE WITH.",
