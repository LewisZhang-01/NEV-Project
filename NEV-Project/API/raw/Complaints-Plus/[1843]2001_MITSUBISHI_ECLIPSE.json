THE FILLER NECK ASSEMBLY IS CONSTRUCTED OUT OF METAL AND INCLUDES A LARGE TUBE/PIPE FOR THE FUEL TO ENTER THE GAS TANK, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER SMALLER METAL PIPES. THE FILLER NECK ASSEMBLY EXTENDS FROM THE FILLER DOOR, WHICH IS SITUATED IN THE REAR PASSENGER QUARTER PANEL, DOWN AND ACROSS TO THE FUEL TANK WHICH IS SITUATED IN THE UNDERCARRIAGE. THERE IS A PARTICULAR POINT WHERE THE PIPES IN THE ASSEMBLY MAKE AN APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREE BEND, MOVING FROM A DOWNWARD ANGLE TO AN ANGLE THAT IS MORE PARALLEL WITH THE GROUND. AT THIS BEND OR ELBOW, THE MANUFACTURER PLACED A THICK METAL SHIELD, PRESUMABLY TO PROTECT A WEAK POINT. THE SHIELD BOLTS TO THE BODY OF THE CAR IN FOUR PLACES AND CUPS THE FUEL PIPES IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND THE BEND LEAVING AN APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF INCH GAP BETWEEN THE PIPES AND THE SHIELD. THIS SHIELD AND PIPE ASSEMBLY IS SITUATED DIRECTLY BEHIND AND SLIGHTLY INBOARD OF THE REAR PASSENGER TIRE, HOWEVER, IT REMAINS EXPOSED. BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE PIPES AND THE SHIELD, AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SHIELD IS ANGLED UPWARDS, AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO COVER OR OTHER PROTECTIVE DEVICE TO SEAL THIS GAP, THE SHIELD COLLECTS DIRT, DEBRIS, GREASE, AND MOISTURE. PRESUMABLY, THE REAR TIRE THROWS THIS FOREIGN MATERIAL AROUND WHICH THEN COLLECTS IN THE SHIELD, BUILDS UP, AND CONTACTS THE PIPES, CAUSING THEM TO RUST. EVENTUALLY THE PIPES RUST COMPLETELY THROUGH CAUSING FUEL TO LEAK ON THE GROUND WHENEVER THE VEHICLE IS REFUELED. THE HOLES IN THE PIPES ALSO ALLOW GASOLINE VAPORS TO ESCAPE AND IMPAIRS THE EVAP SYSTEM. DESPITE THE BUILDUP AND CONTINUAL CONTACT OF FOREIGN MATERIAL IN THE SHIELD, THE SHIELD ITSELF DID NOT RUST AT ALL CREATING A PERFECT COLLECTOR TO GATHER FOREIGN MATERIAL AND CAUSE THE RUST TO FORM.  *TR",

I ASKED AAMCO TO SAVE ALL BROKEN PARTS. THE WAVE SPRING BROKE, WENT THROUGH THE PUMP, AND BROKE THE GEARS JUST AS DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE \"MITSUBISHI F4A51 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HAZARD PROBLEM\".

THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO THE DEALER (COCONUT CREEK MITSUBISHI IN COCONUT CREEK, FLORIDA) TO ASK IF THIS WAS NORMAL. THEY OF COURSE SAID NO. I ASKED WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO GET IT REPLACED. THEIR FIRST RESPONSE WAS TO SELL ME A NEW ONE AT A COST OF $163.70 PLUS TAX, BUT THEY WOULD INSTALL IT FOR FREE BECAUSE THEY ADMITTED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. A WEEK LATER I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER MICHAEL SEE AT COCONUT CREEK MITSUBISHI AND FIND OUT WHAT THE FACTORY REP TOLD HIM. MICHAEL TOLD ME THAT JOHN HACKWORTH THE FACTORY REP SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING. THE FACTORY REP NEVER LOOKED AT THE CAR OR INSPECTED THE BOLTS TO SEE WHY THE MOLDING FLEW OFF. HE HEARD THE AGE OF THE CAR AND THE MILEAGE AND THAT WAS THE BASIS FOR HIS FINAL DECISION. THE STORY THAT MICHAEL SEE AND THE ASSISTANT MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP STANLY ANDERS KEEP TELLING ME IS THAT THE CAR IS SIX YEARS OLD AND HAS 95,000 MILES ON IT AND THINGS BREAK. FIRST MR. ANDERS SAID THAT IT WAS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. THE FACT THAT THE FACTORY REP NEVER CALLED TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE AND INSPECT THE BOLTS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED, IN MY OPINION IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE FACT THAT MITSUBISHI MOTORS OF NORTH AMERICA HAS NO INFLUENCE OVER THE DECISIONS OF A FACTORY REP IS ABSURD. IN ADDITION, THE DASHBOARD IS SLOWLY FALLING APART. THE DASHBOARD HAD APPROXIMATELY SEVEN CRACKS IN IT WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR. THE DEALER SAID THAT THIS IS NORMAL ON CONVERTIBLES AND THAT THEY WILL NOT REPLACE IT. YOUR CAR, YOUR PROBLEM WE DID MORE THEN ENOUGH FOR A USED CAR. TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT ELEVEN OR TWELVE CRACKS AND I SUPPOSE THAT ONE DAY IT WILL JUST FALL APART COMPLETELY, BUT ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THAT'S NORMAL. *TR",

I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH IS GOSSETT MITSUBISHI HERE IN MEMPHIS, TN AT LEAST FOUR TIMES SINCE LAST NOVEMBER REGARDING TRANSMISSION ISSUES. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING IS THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY SLUGGISHLY AFTER I HAVE DRIVEN AROUND 100 MILES STRAIGHT AT ABOUT 70 TO 75 MPH. THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THE LAST PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH MY VEHICLE WAS DURING ANOTHER ROAD TRIP. THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION AGAIN SHIFTED SLUGGISHLY AND THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION RAN HOT AND SPEWED OUT TRANSMISSION FLUID WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO SMOKE BADLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I HAD TO PULL OVER ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHICH MADE FOR A LONG TRIP HOME. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG. THE SERVICE MANAGER NAMED [XXX] RECOMMENDED THAT I HAVE THEM INSTALL AN AFTER-MARKET CONDENSER TO HELP KEEP THE TRANSMISSION FLUID COOL. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO AGREE TO THIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE. THIS AFTER-MARKET CONDENSER THAT WAS INSTALLED AT THIS DEALERSHIP IS NOT A MITSUBISHI PRODUCT. WILSON STATED TO ME THAT THIS PRODUCT IS USED MAINLY ON VEHICLES THAT ARE USED FOR TOWING, BUT I HAVE NEVER USED MY VEHICLE FOR TOWING NOR DOES IT HAVE A TOWING PACKAGE. THE DEALERSHIP CHARGED ME $268 DOLLARS FOR THIS PRODUCT INCLUDING LABOR. SO, NOW I HAVE A BRIGHT SILVER TRANSMISSION FLUID CONDENSER JUST BEHIND THE GRILL OF MY MONTERO SPORT. IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE.

SHE WAS ABLE TO LIMP INTO A SERVICE STATION WHERE SHE NOTICED THE TIRE WOULD NOT HOLD AIR SO SHE HAD TO CHANGE THE TIRE IN SNOW/ICE/FREEZING TEMPERATURES.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THERE WERE THREE LARGE DENTS IN THE RIM AT THE LIP.  THIS IS THE SECOND RIM I AM GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE AND THEY ARE NOT CHEAP (ABOUT $350 EACH).

I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 1997 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE GST I PURCHASED NEW WITHOUT ANY RIM ISSUES AND TRADED IN AFTER 45,000 MILES FOR THE NEW ECLIPSE. THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE MAKING A RIGHT TURN AT A STOP LIGHT DRIVING LESS THAN 10 MPH. I DROVE TOO CLOSE TO A CURB AND MY FRONT TIRE HIT A POTHOLE. THE TIRE INSTANTLY DEFLATED, AND THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE ACTUAL TIRE, HOWEVER THE RIM WAS BENT IN AT LEAST 2-3 INCHES AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER WOULD NOT REPLACE UNDER WARRANTY, SO MY COST FOR A NEW RIM WAS AROUND $300, AND THEN THE DEALER STATED THAT I HAD TO GO ELSEWHERE TO HAVE TIRE AND RIM INSTALLED BECAUSE THEIR TIRE MACHINE WAS BROKEN! TOTAL COST OF THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $320. THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURED ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, BUT I AM STILL NOT SURE HOW OR WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURED. THE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT REAR RIM IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS AS I AM STILL DRIVING ON THIS RIM TODAY. (THE RIGHT REAR RIM IS DENTED LESS THAN 1/4 INCH AND THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON THE TIRE OR THE STEERING.)

THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE CAR FOR 3 MONTHS SUPPOSEDLY FIXING IT AND WHEN I GOT IT HOME I HAD IT FOR A WEEK AND THE WHOLE CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS FALLING APART. I TOOK IT BACK TO THEM AND IT HAD A CRACKED MOTOR MOUNT AND THEY SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THAT.
