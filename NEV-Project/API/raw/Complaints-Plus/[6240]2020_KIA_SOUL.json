        "summary": "Driving car on I-10 west.  Near Pensacola, FL tachometer started fluctuating wildly. Car seemed to be losing power regardless of whether using accelerator or cruise control. Passed exit with a Kia dealer too late to exit, so drove to next exit 4 miles down. Light at end of exit was on hill. Stopped, but when light turned green, car would not move. NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AT ANY TIME. Took Kia Roadside Assistance about 2.5 hrs for tow. Towed to Team Gunther, Daphne, AL Kia dealer. Service rep thought was transmission prob as another customer had reported similar situation. Had to wait til Monday, 2/28/22 to get official word that transmission needed to be replaced. Covered by warranty but since wld take about 2 wks to get part and do work, had to find way to get back home to Jacksonville, FL. Kia Travel Interruption assistance covers max of 3 days and $100 a day, so have been reimbursed for some, but not all expenses since total expense over $300. Car ready for pick up on 3/12/22 and picked up 3/15 after getting back to the area from Jax FL. Could have been major safety probs if I had been unable to exit I-10 or if car had lost power on road with no shoulder....",

        "summary": "The supposed remedy for SC209 on my vehicle only included a test as per the Kia certified techs on 10/27/2021. In June 2021, while the vehicle still had warranty remaining, my Kia soul stalled out at a traffic light near Towson, Maryland. The check engine light illuminated, as well as oil pressure. I brought the vehicle to Kia of Westchester (PA) to remedy the issue. The determination at the time was a cam shaft pin had broken, and that was the cause. They replaced the pin, and I continued to have the check engine light come on. I took the vehicle back on 6/17/2021 with the same issue of check engine light and stalling. They reported no issue, and no light after they had cleared the code. I noticed by early autumn a strange knocking sound at low RPM and the check engine light re illuminated. This was the time frame that the \"test\" for the SC209 recall was \"performed\" and the Soul apparently passed (no explanation was given for the parameters at the time). The techs suggested the check engine was now due to a faulty catalytic converter (10/27/2021 mileage 107564). I was also told that the sound I was hearing at low RPM was \"engine pinging\" and I needed to use higher octane gas (not manufacturers recommendation). 1/15/2022 My wife was operating the vehicle coming back from work in Philadelphia when the Soul sputtered and died, shutting off the engine and causing check engine and oil lamp to illuminate. At this point, the engine struggled to reach any highway speed, the engine could would rev loudly and clouds of bluish grey smoke billowed from the exhaust. I replaced the spark plugs (2nd time, less then 12k mileage) and all coil packs with OEM parts. I noticed burnt oil on the old spark plugs. I brought the vehicle to Jiffy Lube in Glasgow, DE to perform a full synthetic oil change (recommended, and what I normally do). The vehicle continued to have the same issues, and blow out large blue gray clouds of exhaust.",

Then it would sporadically kick in enough that I put my 4 ways on, got off the interstate (81) and limped that car home because the car would not go more that 20 MPH once it came to a full stop, it couldn't even make it up the very small grade to get onto my driveway.

Dealer said transmission was replaced , this time it took 2 weeks, got the car back on 5/1/21.  I asked why does this keep happening and the dealership refused to provide any information, shrugged their shoulders.  The attendant at the service counter just kept saying I just work here and don't know anything about the cars!

IT SLOWED SO MUCH THAT I WAS BARELY MOVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I COULD NOT CHANGE LANES BECAUSE I WAS IN THE FAR LANE AND IF I ATTEMPTED TO GET OVER I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT BY THE CARS PASSING. THIS WAS DURING RUSH HOUR I'M A MAJOR CITY. LUCKILY THERE WAS AN EXIT TO THE LEFT I WAS ABLE TO STEER OFF TO GET OFF HIGHWAY. I ATTEMPTED TO GET OFF THE ROAD AND THE CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED ON THE EXIT RAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. I WAS STUCK AND COULDN'T MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.

WHEN I GOT HOME THE NOISE BECAME LOUDER AND I IMMEDIATELY CALLED KIA OF PALM SPRINGS CA TO TAKE IT IN. THEY TOLD ME AN APPOINTMENT WOULD TAKE WEEKS TO TAKE IN OR DROP OFF AND WOULD TAKE ABOUT 4 DAYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.  I DECIDED TO DROP IT OFF AS THE CAR WAS STILL MOVABLE, DROPPED IT OF WITH NO APPOINTMENT. THE DEALER CALLED ME ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND COULD NOT FIND A REASON FOR THE NOISE AND WOULD KEEP CHECKING.  ABOUT ANOTHER WEEK INTO THE ISSUE WE WERE TOLD THE ENGINE FAILED AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. TO DATE, AND WOULD TAKE 3 TO 4 WEEKS TO RECEIVE A NEW ENGINE AND ANOTHER 2 WEEKS FOR INSTALLATION. WE ARE NOW IN DECEMBER AND HAVE NO CAR AND HAVE HAD TO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON OUR CAR LOAN. I HAVE COMPLAINED DIRECTLY TO KIA MOTORS AND EVERY TIME I HAVE CALLED THEY SEEM TO NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY OUR COMPLAINT AND THEY KEEP PASSING THE BUCK TELLING ME THAT MY CASE WILL HAVE TO BE ESCALATED TO A HIGHER AND DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE NO ONE HAS AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISION UNLESS WE GO THRU THEIR PROCESS OF ESCALATION AND EACH TIME SAY THEY WILL CALL ME AND I HAVE TO CALL THEM.  I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS SITUATION AND REGRET HAVING BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE.",
