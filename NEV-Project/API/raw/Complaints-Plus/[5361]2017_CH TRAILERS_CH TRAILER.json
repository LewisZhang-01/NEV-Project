        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 19FT TRAVEL TRAILER, MODEL YEAR 2017, THAT WAS DELIVERED TO ME ON MARCH 5, 2017 AFTER 7 DAYS TOWING IT FROM GEORGIA TO UTAH.  THE PLANNED 3 DAY TRIP WAS EXTENDED BECAUSE OF SEVERE SWAYING AND BOUNCING ON THE HITCH, EVEN WITH A WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION HITCH.  THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THE 19 FT TRAILER WAS BUILT ON A FRAME DESIGNED FOR A 16 FT TRAILER.  PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED FILES (5) INCLUDING THE CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN THAT STATES THIS IS A 16 FT TRAILER BUT THE VIN STATES IT IS A 19FT TRAILER.  OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS ARE ATTACHED AS WELL.  A VIDEO DESCRIBING AND SHOWING THE ISSUE CAN BE SEEN HERE:  HTTPS://DRIVE.GOOGLE.COM/OPEN?ID=0B5ST-FOIQVZIWUXXA0JKOWQ0D2M  THIS EXPENSIVE TRAILER (FINANCED) CANNOT BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE IT WAS INTENDED AND CANNOT BE RESOLD BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY ISSUES CAUSED BY BUILDING A TRAILER ON AN IMPROPERLY SIZED FRAME.  THE WRONG FRAME SIZE RESULTS IN AN IMPROPER AXLE POSITION.  THE IMPROPER AXLE POSITION RESULTS IN THE MAJORITY OF THE WEIGHT BEING PLACED BEHIND THE AXLE.  THIS AXLE POSITION CAUSES SEVERE SWAYING BY PASSING18-WHEEL COMMERCIAL TRUCKS, SPEEDS OVER 50 MPH, AND WIND.  THE TRAILER CAN ONLY BE TOWED IN IDEAL HIGHWAY CONDITIONS...  NO COMMERCIAL TRUCKS, NO WIND, AND NO BUMPS ON THE SURFACE OF THE ROAD.  IN OTHER WORDS...  RARELY IF EVER.",

        "summary": "THE BUMPER PULL TRAILER FRAME IS STRUCTURALLY FLAWED CAUSING CONTROL ISSUES (E.G., BOUNCING AND SWAYING WHILE PULLING.)  THE AXLES SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED FURTHER BACK TO ACHIEVE A SAFE TONGUE WEIGHT OF MINIMUM 9% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT.  EMPTY WEIGHT OF TRAILER IS 3,560 LBS (COMMERCIAL WEIGH STATION).  THE DISTANCE FROM THE AXLE TO THE REAR OF THE CAMPER BODY IS 205 INCHES.  LENGTH FROM CENTER AXLE TO THE BACK OF THE TRAILER IS 107 INCHES.  THE RESULT IS A NEGATIVE 2% TONGUE WEIGHT.  ON CITY STREETS ANY BUMP IN THE ROAD RESULTS IN SEVERE 'PORPOISING' WHICH LIFTS THE REAR OF MY TOW VEHICLE (SILVERADO 2500 HD) AND BOUNCES VIOLENTLY.  ON THE HIGHWAY, SPEEDS ABOVE 55 MPH RESULTS IN A SEVERE SWAYING WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FLIP BOTH THE TRAILER AND THE TOW VEHICLE.  IN UTAH, THE INTERSTATE SPEED LIMIT IS 70.  ANY PASSING 18 WHEEL TRUCK COULD PUSH THE TRAILER OFF THE ROAD.  THERE ARE SWAY CONTROL AND WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION TOOLS (EXPENSIVE) THAT CAN COMPENSATE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.  HOWEVER, A NEGATIVE TONGUE WEIGHT IS A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED DESIGN AND A SAFETY ISSUE.  NOTE THE ATTACHED SIDE VIEW PHOTO.  EVEN WITH A WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION HITCH, THE BACK IS TOO LOW.  NOTICE THE AXLE PLACEMENT APPEARS TO BE AT ABOUT 50/50 INSTEAD OF THE SAFE 60/40 INDUSTRY STANDARD.  ALSO ATTACHED IS THE COMMERCIAL WEIGH SLIP FROM MC RECYCLING IN OREM UTAH.  FIRST VALUE IS MY SILVERADO 2500 HD TRUCK WITH THE TRAILER ATTACHED.  SECOND, IS THE WEIGHT OF MY TRUCK WITHOUT THE TRAILER.  THIRD IS THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER GLEANED FROM THE SCALE MEASUREMENTS.  THIS IS AN UNSAFE TRAVEL TRAILER THAT CANNOT SAFELY BE USED FOR TRAVEL PURPOSES.  JERRY LABRON RAGON, THE BUILDER, WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DESIGN FLAW.  I CANNOT SELL THE TRAILER KNOWING ITS SAFETY ISSUES.  THIS LEAVES ME WITH A $21,000 LEMON.  SHIPPER PICKED UP IN ROSSVILLE, GA ON MARCH 6TH, DELIVERED TO ME IN OREM UT MARCH 12TH.
