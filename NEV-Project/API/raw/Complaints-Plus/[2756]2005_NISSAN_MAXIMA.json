IN PREVIOUS DECADES CARS WERE MADE WITH A TRUNK KEY AND OR MECHANICAL CABLE FOR OPENING. MY 2005 MAXIMA AND MOST RECENT VEHICLES ARE MADE WITH ONLY AN ELECTRONIC BUTTON TO OPEN THE TRUNK. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS. RECENTLY MY CAR LOST POWER AT A PRECARIOUS LOCATION AND I HAD NO WAY OF ACCESSING THE TRUNK. MY FLARES, MY BOOSTER CABLES,ALL EMERGENCY TOOLS, SUPPLIES,  FIRST AID KIT, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, WATER ALL LOCKED AWAY IN THE TRUNK AND I HAD NO ACCESS TO IT. THIS IS NOT MERELY INCONVENIENT, BUT VERY DANGEROUS.  CAR MANUFACTURERS MAY SAY THAT THERE IS ACCESS THROUGH THE BACK SEAT. THIS, HOWEVER, IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE. IT IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND CALL FOR PHYSICAL MANEUVER WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT, TIME CONSUMING AND SUBJECT TO FAILURE. FIRST IT IS A TASK IN ITSELF TO FIGURE OUT AND TO GET THAT BACK SEAT DOWN. EVEN WHEN DOWN, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SPACE TO EVEN CRAWL INSIDE AND ACCESS THINGS YOU NEED. FEELING AROUND IN THE DARK WITH YOUR HAND IS NOT EFFICIENT. FURTHERMORE THE APPARATUS TO GET THE TRUNK DOOR OPEN FROM THAT POSITION IS NOT ONLY OBSCURED BUT PHYSICALLY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ENGAGE FROM THAT POSITION. I PROPOSE THAT IT BE MANDATED THAT VEHICLES COME WITH A MORE ACCESSIBLE BACKUP, SUCH AS A MECHANICAL CABLE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CAR OR KEY LOCK FROM THE OUTSIDE TO OPEN THE TRUNK IN CASE OF POWER FAILURE. THIS IS A REAL SAFETY ISSUE! ONE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO ACCESS NECESSARY AND EMERGENCY ITEMS FROM THE TRUNK IN CASE OF POWER FAILURE EMERGENCY! THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL MATTER TO YOU ONLY BECAUSE I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION AND THE POSSIBLE DEVASTATING EFFECT OF THIS IF IT CONTINUES UNCORRECTED.

THE TRANSMISSION HESITATES WHEN CHANGING GEARS EITHER AT IDLE OR WHILE DRIVING THE TRANSMISSION DOES IT THE MOST BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND AND SECOND TO THIRD AND WHEN DOWNSHIFTING IN THOSE SAME GEARS. MY MAIN CONCERN IS MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE OR ANY OTHER FAMILIES IN THE SAME VEHICLE WHEN WE ARE DRIVING IN THE VEHICE OUR HEADS AND NECKS GET WHIPPED BACK AND FORTH VERY ROUGHLY. IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION CHANGING GEARS ON ITS OWN WHILE IM DRIVING THE CAR. I ONLY ASK FOR YOU TO PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND MAKE IT A RECALL. NISSAN DID NOT WANT TO HELP ME OUT OR ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AND HEARD NUMEROUS STORIES ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. IT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. NISSAN PUT OUT A POOR PRODUCT AND WONT FIX IT. THEY NEED TO OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE, BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR DIES.  I ASK OF YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS. NOT ONLY FOR MY SAFETY OR MY INFANT'S SAFETY BUT FOR ANYONE WHO OWNS THIS VEHICLE.  PS. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN IT.  PPS. THE TEST DRIVE AND THE 1ST MONTH WERE FINE UNTIL NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS OCCURRED. PLEASE HELP, PLEASE HELP! GET THIS RECALL ACTIVE!    THANKS, FRANK",

DURING THIS TIME I WAS UNABLE TO CHANGE GEARS AT ALL, I HAD TO PULL OVER & SIT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES TO GET THE CAR MOVING AGAIN. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER & THEY \"BLED THE LINE\". THEY SAID THE FLUID IN THE CLUTCH WOULD GET HOT & TURN INTO \"VAPOR\" WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE CLUTCH PEDAL TO GET STUCK & ADVISED I USE DOT4 FLUID IN THE FUTURE. 5 MONTHS LATER (IN THE WINTER) THE CLUTCH PEDAL AGAIN STARTED GETTING STUCK TO THE FLOOR, I WAS ABLE TO \"POP\" IT BACK WITH MY FOOT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL I GOT TO MY DESTINATION. I TOOK IT TO THE NISSAN DEALER, PAID $150 TO \"DIAGNOSE\" ONLY FOR SOMEONE TO TELL ME THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM & THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE APART MY TRANSMISSION (ANOTHER $650) TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM FURTHER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAD A MECHANIC FRIEND LOOK AT IT WHO TOLD ME TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH MASTER & SLAVE CYLINDER, THEREFORE, I DID. SOLVED THE ISSUE, UNTIL NOW (5 MONTHS LATER). MY CLUTCH HAS BEEN GETTING STUCK TO THE FLOOR & LOOSING PRESSURE OCCASIONALLY THE PAST MONTH, FINALLY YESTERDAY, IT HAS BECOME UN-DRIVABLE. I CANNOT PULL IT BACK UP ENOUGH TO SHIFT IT INTO GEAR.

WE PURCHASED CAR FROM NISSAN DEALER); ALL MAINTENANCE IS PROPERLY PERFORMED.      IN MARCH 2012, WE TOOK CAR TO NISSAN DEALER.  PER DEALER, ENGINE CHAIN IS HITTING AND CAUSING KNOCKING OR RATTLING NOISE IN ENGINE.  IF YOU GOOGLE FOR THIS ISSUE, THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES (EXACTLY SIMILAR ISSUE - 2005 NISSAN MAXIMA - ENGINE KNOCKING OR RATTLING ISSUE)    OVERALL FEEDBACK FROM NISSAN DEALER:  WE / CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ISSUE.  NISSAN DID NOT COVERED IT.  WE PAID @ $1700 CASH (MARCH 27, 2013) TO FIX THAT ISSUE.  NOW AT THIS TIME, (I.E. JUNE 28, 2014) - THIS SIMILAR NOISE IS APPEARING AGAIN.    CUSTOMER REQUEST:  I AM AN ENGINEER; WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY & QUALITY, I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.  ANYONE CAN FILE A LAWSUIT ? JUST TO BE READY FOR TIME AND MONEY (I WISH FOR THAT OPEN CHECK BOOK).    MY REQUEST IS: ARE THERE ANY REGULATION THAT CAN REGULATE SAFETY & QUALITY OF THE CAR; OR MANUFACTURER TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SUCH ISSUE AND ETHICALLY FIX THIS FOR CUSTOMER?  WE (CUSTOMER) PAID APPROX. $36000 FOR SUCH CAR QUALITY?  WOW.....    I HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE OF ENGINE FIX MAID WITH NISSAN MCGRATH - ELGIN, IL DEALER... ALL EVIDENCE ARE THERE... WHEN I SAY EVIDENCE, IT IS LEGAL EVIDENCE.  I MEAN THIS.  NO TALK...ALL OFFICIAL EVIDENCE.       LET ME SEE WHAT NATIONAL CAR SAFETY - DOT CAN DO.....HOPE FOR THE BEST.  *TR",

I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THE CAR FOR MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS SO I AM TRAPPED MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT EVEN IF I CANT DRIVE IT .I HAVE READ ON MANY DIFFERENT FORUMS ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND HAVEN'T FOUND A WAY TO FIX IT , WITH AS MANY REVIEWS OF PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR MAXIMA THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE .  *TR",

A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH WILL YIELD THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE, AND NISSAN REFUSING TO HELP.  THIS IS WHY IN 2007 NISSAN WENT TO A CVT TRANSMISSION AND WARRANTIED IT UP TO 10YEARS/120K MILES (BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE 04-06 FAILURES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT HELPING THOSE PEOPLE OUT).    I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY REFUSED ANY ASSISTANCE IN HELPING ME FIX THE PROBLEM.  I NOW HAVE TO PAY $3,450 FOR A REPAIR DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH NISSANS WORKSMANSHIP.  *TR",

WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS STARTING TO BEGIN, IT ONLY AFFECTED FROM SHIFTING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE,BUT HAS MOVED TO THE CRAZY JERKING IT DOES NOW. AT ABOUT 71,000 MILES I HAD THE CAR TAKEN TO A DEALERSHIP AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING FROM USING A CODE READER, BUT FROM JUST SOME SIMPLE SHIFTING OUT OF GEARS (PARK TO DRIVE, PARK TO REV) THEY RECOMMENDED A TRANS OIL CHANGE (ABOUT $250) WHICH I DENIED, BECAUSE I LOOKED A THE OIL MYSELF AND IT WAS STILL CHERRY RED, SO THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO SPEND TO JUST \"TO SEE IF THAT FIXES THE PROBLEM\". SO AT ABOUT 79,000 MILES WHEN THE HARD JERKING STARTED GETTING BAD, I TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP ,WHICH THEN THEY DID RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM, AND TOLD ME IT WOULD BE ABOUT $4000 TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH STUNNED ME, ESPECIALLY CAUSE I HAD JUST FINISHED PAYING OFF THE CAR AND THE WARRANTY HAD ENDED. SO I OBVIOUSLY I DENIED SUCH A COSTLY REPAIR,BUT IN TALKING TO THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP , I TOLD HIM THAT THE JERKING PROBLEM ISN'T SO BAD AT ALL WHEN I USE THE MANUAL GEARSHIFTS AND I ASKED HIM WHY. WELL HE TOLD ME THAT PROBLEM COULD ALSO BE IN THE VALVE BODY WHICH COULD BE A CHEAPER FIX,BUT  THEY REPLACE WHOLE TRANSMISSION UNITS NOT PARTS, BECAUSE OF WARRANTY PURPOSES, BUT THAT HE'S SEEN QUITE A FEW SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH OTHER VEHICLES. SINCE I TOLD HIM IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO SPEND HE RECOMMENDED A TRANS REPAIR CENTER. SO WHEN I TOOK IT THERE, THEY CONFIRMED THAT JUST CHANGING OUT THE VALVE BODY WOULD BE A \"BANDAID FIX\" AND THAT A FULL REPLACEMENT WOULD BE NEEDED (ABOUT $3500 FROM THEM).

WHEN WE PUT IT INTO DRIVE IT DID THE SAME THING.  ON OUR WAY TO THE STORE THE CAR TOOK A FEW SECONDS TO SHIFT INTO EVERY GEAR AND WOULD SHIFT REALLY HARD WHEN IT DID SO.  FROM THAT POINT WE TOOK THE CAR FOR ITS CHECK UP WITH THE MECHANIC WERE HE DID AN OIL CHANGE, TUNE UP AND SERVICE THE TRANSMISSION UPON TELLING HIM WHAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS DOING HE SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS MESSING UP AND THAT NISSAN HAD A BAD REPUTATION WITH TRANSMISSIONS GOING BAD PREMATURELY AND THAT HE HAD REPAIRED MANY NISSAN OF THE SAME YEAR IF NOT NEWER BECAUSE OF TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  HE ADVISE US THAT AFTER SERVICING THE TRANSMISSION THE PROBLEM MAY OR MAY NOT GO AWAY (OUR TRANSMISSION WAS SERVICED EVERY 15,000-20,000 PRIOR TO PROBLEM).  WE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY GAVE OUT AT 142,864 MILES.  THE TRANSMISSION WAS REBUILT BY A REPUTABLE SHOP ON 7/09/2010 USING NISSAN FACTORY PARTS WAS GIVEN A WARRANTY OF ONE YEAR.  EVERYTHING WORKED FINE UNTIL DEC. 24, 2012 WHEN WE WENT TO PICK UP MY BROTHER FROM THE AIRPORT AND THE SAME THING STARTED TO HAPPEN AS WE STATED ABOVE.  WE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR BUT VERY MINIMAL AND NOT VERY FAR OR NOT AT ALL UNTIL FEBRUARY 19, 2013 AT 219,862 MILES AND 76,998 MILES LATER THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME AND SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE CAR WE WERE FORCED TO GET A LOAN AND REPAIR IT AGAIN. AND $6000.00 LATER WE ARE SCARED FOR A THIRD INCIDENT.  I HOPE THIS MATTER GETS RESOLVED AND NISSAN AGREES TO COMPENSATE THE COST.  *TR",

I TOOK IT TO REPAIR SHOP AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE ENGINE MOUNT-I HAD TO PAY OVER $800 TO GET IT FIXED. AFTER IT WAS FIXED, I STILL HAVE THE PROBLEMS. MY NIECE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS ALSO WITH HER ALTIMA AND WENT ONLINE AND FOUND SIMILIAR COMPLAINTS. SHE DROVE MY CAR ON 11/29/12 AND I TOLD HER TO BE CAREFUL, AND TO BE AWARE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE CAR-SHE HAD HER 3 WEEK OLD BABY WITH HER, SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF ANYTHING WAS GOING ON SHE COULD LET ME KNOW. SHE CALLED LATER ON AND SAID THE CAR SHE HAD BEFORE WAS DOING THE SAME THING AND IT TURNED OUT IT NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. SHE GOOGLED MY CAR AND FOUND 705 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME THING I WAS GOING THRU-I WAS AMAZED OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS, AND NOTHING SEEM TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMERS AFFAIRS AND THEY WANT ME TO TAKE THE CAR TO NISSAN TO HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE IT, WHICH WOULD COST ME $99 OF WHIC I DONT HAVE RIGHT NOW. I TOOK MY NIECE TO GET HER CAR ON SATURDAY 12/1 AND A FEW OF THE SALESMEN THERE SAID YEAH THEY KNOW OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AND ITS GOING TO COST ME TO FIX. I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE FROM NHTSA TO REVIEW ALL THESE COMPLAINTS AND HAVE NISSAN ACKNOWLEDGE WHATS GOING ON WITH THEIR VEHICLES BEFORE WE HAVE A FATAL ACCIDENT. *TR",

AS MY VEHICLE WARRANTY WAS APPROACHING EXPIRATION I HAD IT SERVICED TO MAKE SURE THINGS WERE IN ORDER. ANYWAY, JUST 2 WEEKS AGO (MID JANUARY 2012) I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR TRANSMISSION SERVICE.  WHEN I GOT MY CAR BACK THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING STARTED AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT IS HAPPENING MORE OFTEN.  I WILL BE GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TRANSMISSION WINDS LIKE IT WAS PUT IN NEUTRAL AND THE BUMPS INTO GEAR GIVING ME A WHIPLASH EFFECT (DID I MENTION I SUFFER WITH NECK PAIN).  I AM NOW REALLY AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR AS IT MAY SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL WHILE I AM PASSING SOMEONE OR CROSSING TRAFFIC AND THE RESULT COULD BE FATAL.  WITH ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS MADE, I SURE HOPE SOMEONE WILL COME TO OUR AID AND HAVE THIS PROBLEM RECALLED.  I CALLED THE NISSAN COMPLAINT DIVISION AND THEY SAID SINCE THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY WORK ON THE TRANSMISSION, THEY COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY.  IN OTHER WORDS, GIVE ME YOUR MONEY AND FORGET YOU.  IT IS SAD WHEN YOU BUY A VEHICLE AND PAY ALOT FOR IT THINKING YOU WILL HAVE DEPENDABLE TRANSPORTATION YOU GET SCREWED SO BADLY.

THE COMPONENT THAT FAILS ON THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES IS THE TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY. COUNTLESS BLOGS ON INTERNET ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE.  SINCE 2006, THE NISSAN MAXIMA HAVE CVT (NO SHIFT) TRANSMISSION.  THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION ALSO CAUSED DAMAGE TO TWO OUT OF THE THREE MOTOR MOUNTS, WHICH WILL COST ANOTHER $800-$1,000 WHEN REPAIRED.

SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SPORADICALLY JERK HARSHLY WHEN ADVANCING TO FIRST GEAR BETWEEN 20-25 MPH. THIS STARTED TO HAPPEN MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY AND AT TIMES THE VEHICLE WOULD HESITATE RIGHT BEFORE JERKING INTO FIRST GEAR AND THEN QUICKLY THRUST FORWARD WITH REVVED UP RPMS. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I FELT EXTREMELY UNSAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. THE SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS AN INCREASINGLY COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2004 & 2005 MODEL YEAR MAXIMAS. HE SAID THAT THE ONLY REMEDY WAS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $4,000!   I TOOK MY CAR TO A TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP FOR A SECOND OPINION AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING. THE MECHANIC CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH MAXIMAS MANUFACTURED IN THOSE MODEL YEARS. I ENDED UP TAKING MY CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD THEM REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS INTERNET SITES BY OWNERS OF 2004 & 2005 MAXIMAS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRANSMISSION.   IT'S CLEARLY APPARENT  THAT THERE IS A MAJOR DEFECT WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS THAT WERE INSTALLED IN 2004 & 2005 MAXIMAS. I HAVE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND HAVE KEPT UP WITH REGULAR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE INTERVALS. THERE IS NO WAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AT THAT MILEAGE IF IT WAS NOT DEFECTIVE.   I BESEECH YOU TO RECALL ALL 2004 & 2005 MAXIMAS AND FIX THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM BEFORE IT CAUSES SEVERE ACCIDENTS IF THERE HAVE NOT ALREADY BEEN.  *KB",

FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, THE TRANSMISSION IN THE NISSAN MAXIMA FROM 2004-2008 HAS SOME SORT OF DEFECT BUT NISSAN REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL AND FIX THE PROBLEM.

NISSAN TOLD ME TO TAKE IT INTO A DEALERSHIP AND HAVE A DIAGNOSIS DONE ON THE VEHICLE AND SEND THE PAPERWORK IN. I DID JUST THAT. THEN A WEEK LATER I RECEIVED A CALL SAYING THAT NISSAN WILL NOT COVER MY REPAIR BECAUSE IT WAS SO FAR OUT OF WARRANTY. HOW CONVENIENT, THE VEHICLE STARTS BREAKING RIGHT AFTER THE WARRANTY GOES OUT. THIS WILL COST ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX. I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM THIS SERIOUS, OR ANY PROBLEM THIS EARLY IN THE LIFE OF ANY OF MY CARS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND NISSAN SHOULD STAND BY THEIR TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND FIX THE PROBLEM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE SAME VEHICLE. WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS MY TRANSMISSION WILL LOCK INTO 5TH GEAR AND STAY THERE. IF I ACCELERATE OR DECELERATE IT WILL STILL BE IN 5TH GEAR.

I DO A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK AND HAVE ABOUT 93,000 MILES NOW ON THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE LONG DISTANCES EVERY DAY. THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION HAS BECOME MORE NOTICEABLE WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS. THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY HARD FROM 1ST TO 2ND AND SOMETIMES 3RD AND BACK DOWN AND FEELS LIKE A BUCKING BRONCO.  TODAY THE TRANS SLIPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ACCELERATING AT LEAST THREE TIMES ON MY DRIVE IN TO WORK AND THE RPM'S WENT FLYING.  IT'S NEVER SLIPPED COMPLETELY UNTIL TODAY.  THE TRANSMISSION IS FAILING AND IT SHOULD BE LASTING A LOT LONGER THAN 5 YEARS.  OVER THE PAST 2-3 MONTHS THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE.  NOW IT DOES THE BUCKING BRONCO THING EVERY DAY, SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.  I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE CAR IN ONCE (TO A LOCAL TRANSMISSION SHOP) AND THEY TRIED A TRANSMISSION FLUSH THAT COST NEARLY $400.  IT SEEMED TO HELP FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BUT THE PROBLEM IS BACK AND IS MUCH WORSE NOW.  I AM PLANNING TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN BUT I'M BEING TOLD THAT IT MAY COST ME $1,500 TO $2,000 TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF REPORTS ONLINE FOR THE SAME ISSUE.

NOV /12 /10  @ 5;00 PM DURING RUSH HOUR IN THE CENTER OF THE BUSIEST FREEWAY IN MY AREA LEAVING ME THANKFUL TO GOD AND THE RIVERSIDE CTY. FREEWAY SERVICE PATROL WITH WHICH I FILLED OUT A SURVEY #217446 THEIR # 951 369-3691. ACCIDENTS WERE BEHIND ME SOMEWHERE THE TWO DRIVER SAID  I WAS FORTUNATE TO NOT  SUFFER INJURY AND DAMAGE. THE MAXIMA COST OF REPAIR TO NISSAN'S PRODUCT IS OVER $ 6,000.00. THE MAXIMA HAS ONLY 77,435 MILES. THESE ARE ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL DEFAULTS AND THERE ARE SCORES OF OWNERS REPORTING SIMILAR TO IDENTICAL EXPERIENCES ABOUT THEIR MAXIMA CARS FROM 2004 THROUGH 2007. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT NHTSA HAVEN'T RECOGNIZED THIS AS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. WHY DON'T THE PEOPLE THAT BUY THESE PRODUCTS IN GOOD FAITH GET THE BACKING OF THE NHTSA. THERE ARE RECALLS ON WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT- THAT ANYBODY CAN REPLACE WITHIN TWENTY DOLLARS BUT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM, THIS IS MONEY FOR PAYING RENT FOR MONTHS, THIS IS THE COST OF SURGERY TO KEEP A WORKING PERSON AMBULATORY, THIS IS A CALL FOR HELP, A CALL TO KEEP SOME OF THE PROFITS OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS AT HOME .THIS IS WHEN THE FORCE OF THE NHTSA'S AUTHORITY SHOULD SEEMINGLY COME TO THE FOREFRONT DEMANDING THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AS SAFE AND TRUSTWORTHY AND CERTAINLY NOT A VEHICLE DOING SIXTY MILES AN HOUR DURING RUSH HOUR COMING TO A DEAD STOP WITH VEHICLES PEALING TO ALL SIDES IN ALL DIRECTIONS DESPERATELY AVOIDING COLLISIONS AND PERSONAL INJURY AS WELL AS INJURY TO OTHERS AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. HERE I WAS SITTING THERE EYES SHUT TIGHT WAITING FOR THE SLAM OF SOME VEHICLE INTO MINE THAT REFUSED TO BUDGE. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE MIDST OF COMMITTING SUICIDE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PREVENT IT.

IT'S AMAZING HOW NISSAN HAS NOT RECALLED THESE VEHICLES FOR THIS PROBLEM. ABS SYSTEM NOT WORKING IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I DON;'T SEE HOW THEY CAN IGNORE THIS. NOT JUST THAT, THIS SORT OF BECOMES A SCAM SINCE THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND STILL NOT RECALLING IT. *TR",

MINE IS A MAXIMA SE WITH 5 SPEED AUTO (WITH MANUAL SHIFT MODE).  ONCE THE CAR WARMS UP, THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY HARD AND ROUGH FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR.  IT ALSO DOWNSHIFTS HARD FROM 3RD TO 2ND GEAR. AT THIS POINT, IF I PUT THE CAR IN PARK OR REVERSE, AND THEN BACK INTO DRIVE, THERE'S ABOUT A 3-5 SECOND DELAY, THEN IT MAKES A BANGING NOISE AS IT KICKS INTO GEAR.  THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS GET WORSE: WHEN SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND AND 2ND TO 3RD GEARS IT SLIPS INTO NEUTRAL (CAUSING RPM'S TO FREELY SHOOT UP NEARLY TO THE REDLINE) AND THEN JERKS AND SLAMS BACK INTO GEAR VERY ROUGH & HARD. THIS REALLY AFFECTS THE CARS PERFORMANCE.  THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS GO FROM WORSE TO MORE WORSE: EVENTUALLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 3RD AND 4TH GEAR, I'LL HEAR AND FEEL THE TRANSMISSION MAKE A BANGING SOUND AND LOCK UP...NO UP OR DOWN SHIFTING. THIS CAUSES THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT TO LIGHT  UP. AT THIS POINT, THE CAR ACCELERATES VERY SLOWLY FROM A STOP SINCE IT'S LOCKED IN GEAR AND AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THE RPM'S ARE VERY HIGH. WHEN SWITCHING THE TRANSMISSION TO MANUAL MODE, THE GEAR INDICATOR ALWAYS STAYS AT \"5\". I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF FOR A FEW SECONDS AND RE-START THE CAR TO GET THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT AGAIN, BUT UNLESS IT'S HAD SEVERAL HOURS TO COOL OFF, THE SAME PROBLEMS START AGAIN IMMEDIATELY IN SEQUENCE. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT AND HOW NISSAN IS NOT BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BLOWS MY MIND AND IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A $30,000+ CAR THAT'S UNDER 5 YEARS OLD!!! *TR",

IT WENT FROM A SLIGHT JERK AND SLIP OF THE GEARS TO A JERK SO HARD THAT IT BROKE THE ENGINE MOUNTS. I BROUGHT IT IN AND GOT THE ENGINE MOUNTS FIXED AND ALSO HAD THEM DO A DIAGNOSTICS. I WENT TO 4 DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS AND 2 MECHANICS AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG. NISSAN KEPT TELLING ME TO GET A TRANSMISSION FLUSH WHICH I DID TWICE AND STILL DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO GOT THE TIMING BELT REPLACED AS WELL AS GOT THE VEHICLE CHECKED OUT BY A NISSAN TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST. NOT TO MENTION EVERY DIAGNOSTIC TEST IS $100. THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. THE INTENSE JERKING DURING ACCELERATION AND BREAKING IS NOT ONLY UNSAFE FOR US, BUT FOR OTHERS ON THE ROAD. THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT HAPPENED COMING OFF THE HIGHWAY LATE ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS SLOWING DOWN ON THE OFF RAMP AND THE JERK WAS SO SEVERE THAT IT HAD GIVEN MYSELF AND MY PASSENGER WHIP LASH AND CAUSED US TO SPIN OUT.  AFTER ALL THE MAINTENANCE, PARTS REPLACED AND I?M  STILL EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM MEANS THAT NISSAN IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB TO GET THIS RECTIFIED. IT?S COSTING ME TOO MUCH TIME AND MONEY. I HAVE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK EVERY TIME TO GET THESE THINGS DONE AND THE SAME PROBLEMS ARE RECURRING AND NOW I DON?T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I RECENTLY READ SOME REVIEWS AND I NOTICED THAT THIS IS A POPULAR PROBLEM WITHIN 2004-2005 NISSAN MAXIMA?S BUT YET THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALLS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO COMPENSATE THE CONSUMER.

SHE DROVE FIVE BLOCKS AND CAME TO A STOP INTERSECTION OF MAPLE STREET AND JEFFERSON STREET.  AFTER STOPPING SHE BEGAN TO PROCEED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED AGAIN.  AFTER LEAVING EFFINGHAM SHE DROVE HOME TO METROPOLIS WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 160 MILES.  I CAME HOME FROM WORK AND SHE EXPLAINED THE TWO INCIDENTS THAT HAD OCCURRED IN EFFINGHAM.  I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND IN A FEW SECONDS THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT APPEARED.

I REMOVED THE FUEL TANK CAP AND RESET IT AGAIN AS THE OWNER MANUAL STATED.  ACCORDING TO NISSAN THE LIGHT MAY GO OFF AFTER A SHORT TRIP. WE DROVE TO PADUCAH KY.
