THIS TIME WITH THE PASSENGER'S SIDE, BMW IS UNWILLING TO PAY FOR MY RENTAL BECAUSE BMW CORPORATE DID NOT OPEN A CAMPAIGN ON MY CAR.  I ALREADY CALLED BMW CORPORATE AND MENTIONED I FEARED FOR MY FAMILY'S SAFETY, BUT THEY DID NOT CARE. I WISH TO PARK MY X-6, BE GIVEN AN ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION UNTIL MY AIRBAG IS FIXED.  NO RECALL LETTER HAS BEEN SENT AS WELL.  THIS RECALL STARTED ON MAY 25TH AND NO LETTER HAS BEEN SEND.  I FIND BMW NEGLIGENT AND TO SAVE MONEY ON RENTAL, ISN'T SENDING LETTERS TO CLIENTS AFFECTED.  I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY AND IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC EVENT FIND BMW 100% LIABLE TO FULL EXTEND OF THE LAW.",
