I was getting home one afternoon and when I put the car in park, smoke just started billowing out from under the hood. So I went to take a look and there was fluid leaked everywhere. At first I thought it was oil as I had just had my oil changed so I took it back to the mechanic for further inspection and he informed me it was the coolant outtake housing. He even said to me that they get so many cars like mine, Chevy Cruz\u2019s, that come in with the same issue. I would also like to mention that when I bought the car it only had 62,000 miles and when this occurred it was at about 71,000. So I went online to do some research about the part and cost of labor and came across so many of the same complaints. There were even posts about this part on a discussion board on the GM website.",

I WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING MY CAR IN TO BE LOOKED AT UNTIL TUESDAY, JULY 16.     AGAIN, THE MECHANICS AT THIS DEALERSHIP FOUND A DIFFERENT PROBLEM WITH MY CAR. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE COOLANT TANK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH THE RADIATOR CAP. I HAD BOTH OF THESE ITEMS REPLACED AT NO COST. I ASKED THEM TO TEST THE ENGINE ONCE AGAIN TO BE SURE THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN RESOLVED.

IN JUNE 2017, MY ENGINE OVERHEATED DUE TO A MALFUNCTION IN MY COOLANT SYSTEM. AS A RESULT, I HAD MY COOLANT FLANGE REPLACED. A FEW DAYS LATER, MY CAR BEGAN TO SMOKE AND MY ENGINE WENT IDLE. THE COOLANT LEAKS FROM THE FLANGE AND THE RESERVOIR OFTEN. SOMETIMES, IT LEAKS AS I DRIVE, OTHER TIMES, IT'LL BE PARKED AND LEAK OUT WHEN IDLE. I NEVER USE MY AIR CONDITIONING OR HEAT ANYMORE DUE TO THE BURNING SMELL OF THE COOLANT. I HAD MY COOLANT FLANGE REPLACED A SECOND TIME. MY CAR WAS DOWN FOR 3 MONTHS AND I JUST GOT IT REPAIRED AGAIN. LAST WEEK, OCTOBER 10, 2017, MY CAR BEGAN TO SMOKE AGAIN, MY ENGINE WENT IDLE, AND WHEN I POPPED THE HOOD, THE COOLANT HAD LEAKED OUT COMPLETELY. ANY TIME IT HAS OVERHEATED AND THE ENGINE WHEN IDLE, I'VE BEEN ON THE FREEWAY, DRIVING AT LEAST 60 MPH OR ON THE STREET, DRIVING AT LEAST 30 MPH. MORE RECENTLY, WHEN IT OVERHEATED, THE CAR HAD BEEN IDLE FOR 2 HOURS AND THEN 5 MINS INTO ME DRIVING IT, IT HAPPENED. I WAS DRIVING DOWN A DARK HIGHWAY, GOING ABOUT 25 MPH. BEFORE THE ENGINE OVERHEATED, I HAD 65% OIL LIFE AND AFTERWARDS, I HAD 0% OIL LIFE. MY UNCLE HAD JUST ADDED COOLANT TO MY RESERVOIR THE DAY BEFORE, BUT IT LEAKED OUT COMPLETELY. LUCKILY, I WAS NOT ALONE THIS TIME. I'M ALWAYS CAUTIOUS THAT MY ENGINE WILL BLOW OUT WHEN I DRIVE IT. MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME TO BE SURE THAT I ALWAYS HAD COOLANT AND WATER IN MY TRUNK AT ALL TIMES, IN CASE IT LEAKS OUT. I TRAVEL 40 MINS TO WORK EVERY OTHER DAY AND IT'S QUITE FRIGHTENING, KNOWING THAT AT ANY TIME, MY ENGINE MAY OVERHEAT AGAIN, DUE TO THE COOLANT LEAK.

AS MENTIONED EARLIER, GM PERSONNEL TOLD ME THAT THREE REMEDIES MADE UP SPECIAL COVERAGE 14311'  1, NEGATIVE BATTERY CABLE NEEDS REPLACEMENT.   2. VOLTAGE REGULATOR NEEDS ADJUSTMENT  3.

THE CAR HAD BEEN IN MY GARAGE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH A DEAD BATTERY. THIS MORNING I JUMP-STARTED THE VEHICLE; SO, WE CAN ASSUME THE ALTERNATOR WAS WORKING PROPERLY BECAUSE THE CAR CONTINUES TO RUN AFTER DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY CABLES. I DROVE TO THE STORE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE AND REPLACE THE BATTERY I NOTICED THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS READING 15.1 VOLTS.      AFTER REPLACING THE BATTERY, I WAS RETURNING HOME AND NOTICED THE BATTERY VOLTAGE FLUCTUATED FROM 14.7 WHILE IDLING TO 14.8 WHILE DRIVING.     MY QUESTION TO YOU    THE ALTERNATOR APPEARS TO WORKING CORRECTLY BY PROVIDING ELECTRICAL POWER TO OPERATE THE CAR WHILE USING A DEAD BATTERY. IF THERE WERE A POWER FLUCTUATION, WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME THE VOLTAGE REGULATOR COULD BE THE PROBLEM. COULD ERRATIC VOLTAGE CAUSE THE INSTRUMENTS TO GO HAYWIRE AND COULD LEAD TO THE CAR'S ENGINE TURNING OFF?

NOTICED THAT THE COOLANT LEVEL IS ABOUT 3 INCHES LOW IN OVER FLOW TANK.           LOOKED ON THE INTERNET ABOUT CRUZE CARS AND FOUND MANY POSTS ABOUT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. GM TELLS THEM ALL    THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS BUT YOU TUBE VIDEOS SHOW GAUGES AND RADIOS CUTTING OUT WHEN DRIVING.

THEY EMIT ANTIFREEZE FUMES CONSTANTLY AND GM IS NOW CLAIMING THAT THIS IS NORMAL AND THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. SHORTLY AFTER I PURCHASED THE 2011 MODEL I BEGAN TO NOTICE THE SMELL OF HOT ANTIFREEZE EVERY TIME I WOULD DRIVE THE VEHICLE, I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FIX IT WITH NO LUCK. FINALLY AFTER ABOUT TWO YEARS OF DEALING WITH THIS I GOT TIRED OF IT AND TRADED IT OFF FOR A 2013 SAME MODEL. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STUPID AND WAS BUT MY REASONING WAS THAT I LOVED THE CAR AND THOUGHT THAT SURELY GM HAD CORRECTED THIS ISSUE BY NOW(I WAS VERY WRONG). SHORTLY AFTER MY PURCHASE OF THE 2013 I BEGAN TO SMELL THE ANTIFREEZE AGAIN AND AGAIN BEGAN THE PROCESS WITH GM TO GET IT FIXED BUT AS BEFORE, NO LUCK. FINALLY AFTER FIGHTING WITH IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS GM HAS CALLED ME BACK AND SAID THAT THE SMELL IS NORMAL OPERATION FOR THIS VEHICLE. ACCORDING TO THEM THE WATER PUMP IS DESIGNED TO LEAK A SMALL AMOUNT AND THE LEAKAGE IS CAUGHT IN A RETENTION CHAMBER BUILT INTO THE WATER PUMP THEM EVAPORATED OUT VIA THE HEAT OF THE ENGINE CAUSING THE CONSTANT SMELL. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT SNIFFING THESE HOT ANTIFREEZE FUMES ALL THE TIME CAN'T BE GOOD FOR YOU AND WILL IN THE LONG TERM CAUSE HEALTH ISSUES. WITH THIS ANSWER I ASK GM TO TAKE THE CAR BACK OR AT LEAST LET ME TRADE IT FOR ANOTHER MODEL BUT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO HELP ME ANY MORE.

MINOR STEERING CORRECTIONS BECOME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THE STEERING WHEEL WILL ONLY MOVE IN FINITE INCREMENTS SO DRIVING THE CAR BECOMES DIFFICULT, EVEN DANGEROUS SINCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO POSITION IT PROPERLY IN THE TRAFFIC LANE.  WEATHER OR TEMPERATURE DOES NOT SEEM TO AFFECT THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR STEERS PROPERLY ON SHORT TRIPS BUT ON A REGULAR, WEEKLY TRIP I MAKE, THE PROBLEM ALWAYS OCCURS AFTER ABOUT 90 MILES.  AFTER THE CAR IS STOPPED (AT THE 130 MILE MARK) FOR A COUPLE HOURS, THE PROBLEM DOES NOT REOCCUR AT START-UP.  DEALER HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM--BUT HASN'T DRIVEN THE CAR FOR MORE THAN A MILE OR SO.",
