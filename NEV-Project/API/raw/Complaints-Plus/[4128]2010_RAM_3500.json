Seconds later, before my husband could get the truck over to the shoulder of the road, there was a loud banging sound coming from underneath the truck that sounded like something was coming through the floorboard. He was finally able to get the truck pulled to the shoulder of the road but wasn't able to put the truck in the park position. He had to use the park brake to get the truck to completely stop. Once the tow truck safely lifted the truck, you could clearly see gears hanging amd what looked to be remains of the transfer case. The truck was towed to a body shop where several codes were discovered, which all pertained to the truck going into 4wd by itself without any warning and unknowing to the driver.  This glitch is what appears to have caused the transfer case to grenade, further causing damage to the drive shaft and smashing the fuel line.  We, as owners, had the transfer case serviced and fluids flushed just two weeks prior to this happening  After further investigation and conversations with the local Dodge dealer, it appears that this has happened in several situations yet no safety recalls have been issued. There is a national backorder for transfer cases for our particular year which is a red flag. We're now left with an over $8100.00 bill and everyone pointing the finger at each other. This could have ended tragically had there been more traffic on the road when the truck began stalling on the busy interstate.",

        "summary": "My family and I were traveling down the interstate about 60-65mph in 2 wheel drive when out of nowhere we started hearing a whining/roaring noise that quickly got louder. Seconds later, there was a loud rumbling noise that sounded like something was coming through the floorboard of the truck. Luckily, I was able to steer the truck to the shoulder of the road and get it to stop, but the truck would not go into park. I had to use the park brake to make sure that it wouldn't roll. After the tow truck arrived and safely jacked the truck up, we immediately noticed that it was the transfer case that had exploded. Gears were hanging out in plain site and it caused a bend in my front driveshaft. There were no warning signs and I had just had the transfer case and my transmission serviced and flushed 2 weeks prior. This put my family's and other lives in danger because had there been more traffic on the road at the time this happened, I wouldn't have had time or room to maneuver my truck safely to get it off the road. We could have been rear ended or had broken parts fly off the truck, that would have been out of my control. The truck was towed to the shop where I had the transfer case serviced, but as of now there's a national backorder on transfer cases for this truck. In speaking with the dealer and doing my own research, I've also learned that there has been a recall on the transfer cases of 2016 and newer Ram 3500 trucks. This needs to be looked into asap. Codes pulled from the truck at the auto shop where the truck currently is are c1404, c1405, c140d stating that the transfer case motor puts the system in 4wd by itself while driving without any warning.",

ALL FOUR TIRES WERE ROTATED IN MAY AFTER APPROX. 5,000 MILES. THE TIRE THAT WAS WORN OUT BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY TIE ROD WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION WHEN I QUESTIONED MY MECHANIC. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MY OTHER 3 TIRES HAVE VERY LITTLE WEAR ON THEM COMPARED TO THE TIRE THAT WAS ON THE SIDE WITH THE FAULTY TIE ROD.
