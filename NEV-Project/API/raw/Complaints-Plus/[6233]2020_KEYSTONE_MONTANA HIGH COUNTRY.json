        "summary": "We took our 2020 Montana High Country 5th wheel to the dealer for routine preventative maintenance.  When they were repacking the bearings, they found 3 of the 4 seals were blown and there was grease on the backing plates and pads.  This 5th wheel had less than 1700 miles on it.  The technician said there was no way this should have happened with less than 1700 miles.  Repacking is recommended every 12,000 miles according to Keystone.  We bought it in August 2019; this maintenance was done in Mar 2021.  I contacted Keystone and they denied reimbursement for the repair and parts.  They said it wasn't deemed a warranty issue and said may have been done by whoever overpacked them.  This was the first time we had them repacked.  No one had touched the wheels (except for us adding air to the tires) since we owned the 5th wheel.  This had to have been done at the factory whether it was at the Keystone factory or at the chassis factory (possibly Lippert?).  If we had been driving up and down mountains, we could have lost breaking or they could have caught on fire.  I believe this is a safety issue and hopefully there is no others out there like ours.  I thank God we took it in for the routine maintenance.  Photos were provided by repair technician at Walnut Ridge RV in New Castle IN.  I just found out I should report this, so this is why it wasn't reported in March.",
