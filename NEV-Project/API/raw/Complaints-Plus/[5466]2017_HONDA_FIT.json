        "summary": "VTC actuator is beginning to fail. If it catastrophically fails while driving, it could cause bent/seized valves, broken timing chain, broken piston rings, broken piston rods, etc.  If these things were to fail whilst a person is driving at speed, it could cause an accident in which people are killed. At the very least, a failed VTC actuator could cost the vehicle owner several hundreds of dollars to repair or replace.  Honda, Toyota, and other auto manufacturers are aware of this issue as demonstrated by Tech Service Bulletins (TSB) put out by the manufacturers. As an example Honda issued TSB # 16-0188. This TSB clearly identifies the issue, the root cause (VTC actuator failure), and the repair required to remedy the problem.  However, Honda has not yet made a recall in regard to the faulty VTC actuator. They have not even identified what mechanical, or pneumatic process,  causes the problem in the first place. The root cause of the VTC actuator failure might be due to poor oil pressure, bent or weak spring inside the VTC actuator, oil sediment causing the spring or locking mechanism to malfunction, etc. The Honda mechanics merely follow the TSB instructions and replace the VTC actuator and throw away the defective one. Nobody is responsible to dismantle the VTC actuator and determine the root cause of the failure. I've talked to Honda local and corporate levels about this lack of follow-through to locate the root cause, and I've sadly learned there is no process in place to allow for early reporting and ownership/responsibility by Honda Corporate for rectifying and/or keeping the customer from having to pay for an engineering or material defect that might cause catastrophic engine failure.  I talked to the Morristown TN Honda dealership and found that they have serviced several vehicles with failed VTC actuators and that the customer's have paid out of pocket for the repair with no recourse.  I have found that no one us responsible to go back through the supply ch",

I also had the rubber shield around the oil drain area and I had to cut most of it away so I could drive it.  The service writer said it was unnecessary so they would remove the rest. Well of course they lied and did not.  What is really incredible is after he did what he need to do my gas mileage increased 10%!

FINALLY MY 7TH BREAKDOWN WAS BROADCAST AS I WAS TRYING TO CROSS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE AT 1 AM ON VALENTINES DAY AND WITH HONDA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND MY INSURANCE CO ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, NO ONE CAME TO MY AID. I WAS BLOCKINTG TRAFFIC, AS I TRIED MYSELF TO CHANGE THE TIRE AFTER TWO HOURS OF FEAR THAT MY CAR OR I WOULD BE HIT BY A TRACTOR TRAILOR, AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF ME. THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM, ALL LIGHTS ON DASHBOARD ON BEGAN AFTER THE SECOND TIRE MALFUNCTION, AND CANNOT BE RESET. I NEED TO GO TO DEALER AND RENT A CAR FOR THEM TO FIGURE THIS ALL OUT. MEANWHILE, MY GAS MILEAGE HAS MAJOR ISSUES. I REFUEL EVER OTHER DAY. SAME COMMUTE FOR 6 YEARS. WHEN I DROVE MY MINI COOPER, I FILLED UP ONCE A WEEK. BUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK? SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY CAR AT 10,000 MILES. IT FEELS LIKE A CLUNKER. I AM GOING TO GET RID OF IT. LOOK INTO MY STATES LEMON LAW AND RID MYSELF OF THIS HUNK OF JUNK.  I AM ALSO WRITING TO HONDA. BUT THIS TIRE ISSUE HAS COST ME OVER $1500 DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS AND TIME/SAFETY  ISSUES. ONE BUYS A NEW CAR FOR FREEDOM FROM PROBLEMS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP, (ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY KNEW OF THIS \"TIRE\" ISSUE.",
