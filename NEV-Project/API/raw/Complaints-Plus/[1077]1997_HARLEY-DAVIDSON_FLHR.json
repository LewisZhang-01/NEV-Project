THE WHEEL WAS MANUFACTURED @ 1997 BY AMERICAN WIRE WHEELS, WHICH IS NOW DAYTON WHEELS. THE SIDE EDGE OF THE WHEEL BROKE LOOSE FROM THE RIM RESULTING IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF TIRE PRESSURE. HAD I NOT BEEN TRAVELING AT A VERY LOW SPEED, THE DEFECT WOULD HAVE MOST CERTAINLY CAUSED ME TO GO DOWN. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OTHER WHEELS OUT THERE DO NOT COME APART LIKE THIS. ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT, IF ANYTHING, I CAN DO TO GET THE COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANY LIABILITY. YOU MAY HAVE THEM OR YOUR OFFICE MAY CONTACT ME AS YOU FEEL THE NEED.  I WILL RETAIN THE WHEEL FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.  ALSO, I DO NOT RECALL THE \"EXACT\" DATE BUT HAD TO PUT A DATE IN THE FIELD BELOW.  *NM",
