        "summary": "At 49,086,  our 2016 Volkswagen  Golf developed a leak in the thermostat assembly housing. The Volkswagen dealership, Elk Grove Volkswagen in Elk Grove, CA, strongly recommended the replacement of the thermostat assembly housing which included replacement of the thermostat assembly housing, the thermostat itself, a gasket, the replacement of the coolant. Failure to do so would result in the engine overheating and potential damage to the engine.  Looking quickly online, I found several forums which discussed this specific problem:  https://www.vwvortex.com/threads/thermostat-housing-leaking-again-after-recall-done-in-2018.9458318/  https://www.golfmk7.com/forums/index.php?threads/failed-thermostat-housing-coolant-loss-info-gathering.368847/  A low coolant warning light was on, however there were no visable leaks underneath the car. The following is a ibetter description of the problem, taken from the golfmk7 website:  \u201cCoolant will slowly seep out of a weep hole on the underside of the thermostat housing. It doesn't seem to be enough to ever leave a puddle but slight residue may be seen under the thermostat housing and possibly on the oil pan. The loss of coolant often trips the low coolant warning if the level isn't maintained. Depending on the size of the leak, the coolant drop can either be gradual or catastrophic.  Loss of coolant has also been linked to the water pump failing. Furthermore, the accessory bracket gasket can leak hot oil down onto the thermostat housing (even after repair) which can cause failure.\u201c  The service was completed today, 02/16/2022.",

I had the water pump and thermostat housing replaced around 65,000 miles from an independent Volkswagen mechanic. He informed me that it appears the water pump had been replaced prior to my ownership of the vehicle. (41,000 miles). Again, I have to replace the thermostat housing and water pump, for a leak. The failure causes a leak in the pressurized cooling system. The leak is small while parked so there is no noticeable puddle but as the system warms up, the leak happens faster. Because of this issue, I have had multiple warning messages while driving, low coolant level, check engine light, and EPC (Electronic Power Control, which disables activate cruise control and front collision detection systems). On multiple occasions, I was stranded waiting on help because of the failure. As stated, this is a known issue from the manufacturer, as they have had at least 7 revisions to the part. The manufacturer is currently on revision \u201cM\u201d, I am only aware of revisions \u201cF, G, H, J, K, L\u201d and the current revision \u201cM\u201d.
