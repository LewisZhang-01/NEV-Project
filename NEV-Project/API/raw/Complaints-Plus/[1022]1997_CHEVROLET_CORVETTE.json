I PROCEEDED TO PULL OUT OF A PARKING SPACE ONLY TO HAVE THE CAR STALL AND ALMOST GET HIT BY A TRUCK. FORTUNATELY THE TRUCK WAS ABLE TO STOP BEFORE A COLLISION OCCURRED. THE TRUCK DRIVER WAS NOT VERY PATIENT AND PROCEEDED TO GIVE ME A FEW CHOICE WORDS WHILE I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE FAMOUS 10 SECOND DRILL 2 TIMES BEFORE I COULD GET THE CAR TO RUN.    WHAT I REALLY EXPECT IS A SERVICE BULLETIN THAT FIXES A PROBLEM NOT CAUSES ONE I NOW HAVE AN UNSAFE CAR. MY WIFE REFUSES TO DRIVE IT FOR FEAR IT WILL STALL WHEN MOVING FROM A PARKED POSITION INTO TRAFFIC. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. THE CAR HAS STALLED 3 TIMES IN THE LAST WEEK!

I THOUGHT I HAD SPILLED SOME WHEN I FUELED UP, SO I RINSED OFF THE AREA OF THE FILLER NECK AND PUT THE CAR BACK INSIDE. THE DAY I STILL SMELLED FUEL SO I LOOKED UNDER THE CAR AND SAW A LEAK AT THE BACK OF THE FUEL TANK. THE PREVIOUS OWNER TOLD ME THAT BOTH TANK AND UNITS HAD BEEN REPLACED UNDER A RECALL IN 10/97. HEAR IT IS 2 YEARS LATER LESS THAN 13000 MILES ON MY CAR AND THE LEFT TANK IS LEAKING AGAIN. I ASK THE DEALER IF THEY COULD REPLACE BOTH TANKS AGAIN WITH  THE NEW BETTER PARTS. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD ONLY REPAIR THE LEAKING SIDE. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE RIGHT TANK WILL ALSO LEAK AND POSSIBLY BE OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A FAILURE THAT WAS THE MANUFACTORS FAULT TO START WITH. IF THIS LEAK DOES OCCUR OUT SIDE OF THE WARRANTY EVEN AFTER THE RECALL WAS SUPPOSED  TO HAVE BEEN DONE I THINK IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT THE DEALER OR CHEVROLET TO PAY THE FULL COST FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN GET A GUARANTEE ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP! YOU CAN PROVIDE. I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED GM VEHICLES HOWEVER THIS INCIDENT WITH A A NEARLY NEW CAR IS LEAVING A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH.",
