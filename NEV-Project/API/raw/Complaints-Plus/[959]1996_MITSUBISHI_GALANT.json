ANOTHER THREE MONTHS PASSED AND I EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, IT STARTED TO BECOME A TREND, ALMOST EVERY 3,000 MILES I HAD TO REPLACE MY ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS.  THIS CAR IS A DEATH TRAP EVERTIME I DRIVE THIS CAR. I WONDER IF THIS IS THE DAY MY BRAKES WILL FAIL COMPLETLY.  THE SCARIEST MOMENT I HAD DRIVING THIS CAR AND I THOUGHT THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP WAS ON MARCH 3 1997.  I WAS COMING FROM THE DEALER AFTER GETTING MY BRAKES FIXED TRAVELING DOWN ROOSEVELT BLVD, AND WHEN I WAS APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT AND I DREW MY BRAKES I SMELLED SMOKE AND NOTICED IT COME FROM MY FRONT TIRES AND I ALSO RELIZED IT WAS TAKEN MY CAR AWHILE TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP I HAS TO PUSH THE BRAKES A THE WAY TO THE FLOOR FOR THE CAR TO STOP.  I WAS FRIGHTENED I THOUGHT THE CAR WAS GOING TO GO RIGHT THROUGH THE RED LIGHT.  I TRAVELED THE REST OF THE WAY HOME GOING ABOUT 35 MPH INSTEAD OF 50 MPH AND EVEN AT THE SLOWER SPEED, IT WAS STILL DIFFICULT TO STOP.  WHEN I FINALLY GOT HOME I CALLED THE DEALER TO COME TOW THE CAR BACK.  THIS IS THE UNSAFEST CAR I EVER DROVE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO MY WORST ENEMY.  EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY IS SCARED TO DRIVE AND TO GET IN THE CAR, I'M VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT HAVING A CHILD RIDING IN THIS CAR, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE A CHILD'S LIFE.  I'VE HAD FOUR CARS ALL FOR OVER 5YRS AND ONLY HAD TO REPLACE THE BRAKES ONCE NO CAR, ESPECIALLY A NEW CAR SHOULD HAVE THEIR BRAKES REPLACED ELEVEN TIMES TO PUT IS NICELY THAT'S JUST RIDICULOS.  I'VE COMPLAINED MANY TIME TO THE MANUFACTURE AND THEY HAVE IGNORED MY COMPLAINTS.
