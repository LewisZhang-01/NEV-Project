WE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE AVALON ON AUGUST 6, 2014.  THIS FIRST FRIGHTENING INCIDENT OCCURRED AUGUST 11, 2014.

I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL AND APPLIED A BIT MORE GAS, AND NOTHING HAPPENED, AND I THOUGHT THAT MY ENGINE HAD STALLED.  MY TACHOMETER SHOWED THE ENGINE WAS REVVED TO 1200 RPM, BUT THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN.  AFTER A DELAY I ESTIMATE WAS 3 OR 4 SECONDS, THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY ENGAGED, AND THE CAR TOOK OFF.
