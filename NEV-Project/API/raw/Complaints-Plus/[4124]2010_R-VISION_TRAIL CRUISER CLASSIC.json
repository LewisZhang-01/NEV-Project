ONE TIME THE CYLINDER EVEN POPPED OUT THE  DOOR LOCK. EVEN HAD THE DOOR JAM WHILE OUTSIDE AND HAD A HARD TIME TO GAIN ACCESS. THE MOST RECENT WAS ON JULY 02 2014 WHERE MY WIFE WAS STUCK INSIDE THE TRAILER UNABLE TO GET OUT AFTER A TIME OF FOOLING WITH THE  LOCK MECHANISM I WAS ABLE TO GET THE DOOR OPEN . WE HAVE 2 TWO DOORS ON THIS MODEL AND BOTH DOORS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. AS OF NOW WE DO NOT LOCK THE DOORS WITH THE FEAR OF NOT GETTING OUT. ALSO THIS TRAILER IS LOCATED ON A PERMANENT SITE.  *TR",
