AT THE TIME I DID NOT HAVE MY FOOT ON EITHER THE GAS PEDAL OR BRAKE.    I STOMPED ON THE BRAKE BUT NOTHING HAPPENED-IT JUST KEPT REVVING AND SURGING FORWARD.   I SHOVED THE STICK INTO PARK AND LUCKILY IT STOPPED.  MY CAR WAS NOW IN THE SPACE THE PICKUP TRUCK HAD BEEN PARKED IN, AND THE PICKUP TRUCK WAS SHOVED OUT INTO THE DRIVING LANE BETWEEN PARKING SECTIONS.  I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE PICKUP OR WALKING BY OR LOADING GROCERIES NEARBY AND NO ONE WAS HURT.  I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS SHAKING AND COULD BARELY DIAL 911 ON MY CELL PHONE.  THE PICKUP HAD MINOR DAMAGE TO ITS REAR BUMPER, AND MY CAR HAD CRUSHING DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END (HOOD AND BUMPER CRUMPLED, GRILLE CRACKED, 1 HEADLIGHT BROKEN) AND A LARGE PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE POURED OUT BRIEFLY (NO FIRE).   THE POLICE CASE# IS 12-4584 AND THE STATE FARM INSURANCE CLAIM# IS 53-195C-229.  THE CAR WAS TOWED BY AAA TO STAR TOYOTA COLLISION CENTER AT 2112 GULF FREEWAY IN LEAGUE CITY, TX.  I AM AWAITING THEIR EVALUATION ON THE DAMAGE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD IT MAY BE TOTALED DUE TO THE AGE OF THE CAR, ALTHOUGH IT ONLY HAS 55,000 MILES ON IT.  EVEN IF THE CAR CAN BE REPAIRED, I AM WORRIED THAT THE REVVING COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. THE INTERNET HAS NUMEROUS SITES LISTING THE SAME TYPE OF REVVING/SURGING PROBLEMS WITH HYUNDAI ELANTRAS BUT DOESN'T LIST A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  WHAT CAN I DO  IN REGARDS TO THIS SCARY EVENT?  IS THIS A MAJOR VEHICLE PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL ?  I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED AND  WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS TO WHAT THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

ANOTHER ISSUE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM: THERE IS ONE PHILLIPS SCREW WHICH SECURES THE BRAKE DRUM TO THE HUB.

HYUNDAI HAS FAILED TO REPAIR MY SON'S VEHICLE 'WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME\" (PAGE 14 NHTSA \"MOTOR VEHICLES SAFETY DEFECTS AND RECALLS- WHAT EVERY VEHICLE OWNER SHOULD KNOW\") AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY FOR THE FULL COST OF A RENTAL VEHICLE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY.

EVIDENTLY, THE CONDITION IS CAUSED BY ONE-OR-MORE FAULTY AIRBAG SENSORS.  THE RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE RECALL INFORMATION, IS THAT ONE OR MORE AIRBAGS MAY NOT DEPLOY WHEN ACTIVATED.  THE DEALER ENTERED MY VEHICLE'S VIN, TOLD ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL AND REFUSED TO REPLACE THE SENSORS WITHOUT CHARGE.  BECAUSE OF THE EXORBITANT COST OF REPLACEMENT, PLEASE ASK HYUNDAI TO INCLUDE MY VEHICLE IN THE RECALL AND/OR MAIL ME A LETTER OF CREDIT THAT I CAN GIVE TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THIS CONDITION REPAIRED.  ACCORDINGLY, I MUST CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE IN THIS CONDITION UNTIL I HEAR FROM YOU AND/OR HYUNDAI, HERE CONCERNED.

THEY ALWAYS SAY WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  WELL NOW THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON CONTINUOUSLY AND I SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.  THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THE COMPUTER IS SHOWING 12 DIFFERENT CODES FOR THE AIR BAGS AND THAT THEY NOTICED SOMETHING STICKY LIKE POP ON THE WIRES.  THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY.  MY FIRST ISSUE WITH THAT IS THEY SHOULD BE SEALED OFF COMPLETELY SO A LITTLE POP SHOULDN'T FRY THE AIR BAG.  THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT MY HYUNDAI WAS BECAUSE OF THE WARRANTY AND THE ASSURANCE THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING FOR 5 YEARS.  UNFORTUNATELY THAT ISN'T THE TRUTH.  AFTER 6 MONTHS OR SO I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO START MY CAR FOR ATLEAST 15 SECONDS BEFORE I COULD ACTUALLY PUT IT IN DRIVE AND GO.  BUT WHY WASN'T IT LIKE THAT IN THE BEGINNING?  AND AFTER THE FIRST YEAR I NOTICE RUST BEHIND THE PASSENGER DOORS IN NEAR THE WHEEL WELLS WHERE THE CAR IS WELDED TOGETHER.  THAT'S A REAL HIGH QUALITY CAR RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU HAVE A CAR THAT'S 10 YEARS OLDER AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A SPOT OF RUST,THAT SHOWS QUALITY.  WHAT DOES HYUNDAI SHOW?  NOT MUCH AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.  IT SHOWS POOR QUALITY AND A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T REALLY STAND BEHIND THEIR WARRANTY.  LETS NOT FORGET THE FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION IN THE CAR IS HORRIBLE.  IT SHIFTS INTO SECOND GEAR SO HARD AND SOUNDS LIKE A CANON EXPLODING.  THE LIGHT ABOVE THE LICENSE PLATE BURNT OUT 2 WEEKS AFTER THEY REPLACED IT THE FIRST TIME.  AND THE FACT THAT ALL THE WIRES INSIDE MY DOORS WERE CORRODED AFTER TWO YEARS AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  SO, NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG MODULE BEING DESTROYED AND THEY SAID I SPILLED POP OR SOMETHING IN THE CONSOLE AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED IT.  AFTER SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH WIRING IN THE CAR THEY DON'T SEE THAT THIS COULD BE LEGITIMATELY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN THE MODULE.  *NM  ABL.PCO",

THE PROBLEM CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON JAN. 6, 2004 AND THEY CLAIM LIQUID GOT ON TO THE AIR BAG SENSORS AND COMPUTER THROUGH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HOUSING, SO THEY FEEL THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE $1100.00 REPLACEMENT, EVEN THOUGH THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  I FEEL IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND POOR DESIGN TO NOT PROTECT THE SENSORS WITH A COVER IF THEY ARE GOING TO INSTALL THE AIR BAG SENSORS NEXT TO THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, WHICH ARE NEXT TO THE CUP HOLDERS.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A DRINK MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SPLASHED NEAR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, I DO NOT EVER RECALL THAT HAPPENING, AND NO ONE ELSE DRIVES MY CAR.  HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD THAT HYUNDAI CORP. DOES NOT FEEL THIS IS A PROBLEM (THE POSITIONING OF THE COMPUTER IN A VULNERABLE PLACE) BECAUSE \"IN KOREA, PEOPLE DON'T EAT OR DRINK IN THEIR CARS\".  THEN TELL ME WHY THERE ARE CUP HOLDERS IN THEIR CARS.  I THINK THEIR EXPORT MODELS SHOULD HAVE THE AIR BAG SENSORS AND COMPUTER PLACED SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR, AT THE VERY LEAST, IN A COVERED BOX.   *CB  ABL.PCO",

WHEN THIS HAPPENS, IT\u0012S NOT SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO STOP, BUT THE CAR AT TIMES WILL LABOR TO MAINTAIN SPEED.  THE CAR ALSO PRODUCES A LOW PITCH HUMMING SOUND AND A STIFF VIBRATION (SHIMMY) IN THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE BRAKE PEDAL PULSATES WHEN BARELY TOUCHED (AT THE TIME THIS PHENOMENON IS OCCURRING).  AFTER A NUMBER OF MILES THE SYMPTOMS DISAPPEAR. THE FREQUENCY OF THIS EVENT IS ABOUT ONCE EVERY 100 TO 200 MILES.  I BELIEVE THE HUMMING, STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION, AND PULSATING FEELING OF THE BRAKE PEDAL IS BECAUSE THE BRAKES ARE IN AN OVERHEATED STATE DUE TO THE CALIPERS DRAGGING.  HYUNDAI SERVICE IS UNABLE TO REPLICATE THIS PROBLEM, BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAILURE TO SUFFICIENTLY ROAD TEST THE VEHICLE; I.E., THEY MAY HAVE TO ROAD TEST THE VEHICLE FOR 2 HOURS IN VARYING CONDITIONS, HOT WEATHER, MOSTLY FREEWAY TO REPLICATE.  HYUNDAI, AFTER BEING GIVEN THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEMS ON TWO DIFFERENT SERVICE CALLS, HAS NEVER RESOLVED THE ISSUE (OF COURSE, MEANING THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM REMAINS A MYSTERY).
