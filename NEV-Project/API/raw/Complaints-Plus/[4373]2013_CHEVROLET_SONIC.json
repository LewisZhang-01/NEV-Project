Brought the car to the dealership and since the vehicle is out of warranty they want a nonrefundable deposit of $700 just to diagnose, parts and labor would be an additional bill on top of that.

OBVIOUSLY, THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS SHOULD BE ACTIVATED WHEN AN ADULT IS IN THAT SEAT THAT WEIGHS ~ 130 LB.

THEY LOOKED INTO THE CASE AND SPOKE TO CHEVROLET DEALER NORTHPOINT. CONCLUSION IS THE SAME; CAR IS WORKING AS DESIGNED. WE SPOKE TO HIGHER MANAGER OF SR. MANAGER [XXX]  AT CHEVROLET'S OWNER CENTER.
