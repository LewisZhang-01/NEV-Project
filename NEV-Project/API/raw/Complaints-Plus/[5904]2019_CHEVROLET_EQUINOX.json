I pull off the exit and check fluids and brakes and all looks normal as I know some about cars. I called to get it checked today and lady said to bring it in right away as they are aware of this common issue with these equinox. She say either canister or pump failure which I researched and have many people who have complained but GM has changed 2018  certain models but failed this model year also and didn't fix the design for this model year of 2019 D2. Need this investigation to continue and I will begin petition for class action suit against GM which they have been notorious for law suits. Please help!!!",

Upon trying to apply the brakes, I was met with resistance (Hard brake pedal) which prevented my vehicle from properly slowing down. This was caused by a failed/malfunctioning brake booster/vacuum pump. Since I was driving at a safe distance, I managed to barely avoid colliding with the rear of the car making the turn, however, that miss was extremely narrow. My vehicle barely slowed down when the brakes were applied which, had I been on the interstate or traveling at a higher rate of speed,  would have more than likely resulted in a collision. This DEFINITELY puts myself, my wife, and our 2 children's safety at risk. Once I successfully parked the vehicle, a \"Service Brake Assist\" warning messaged appeared for the 1st time.  I began researching/attempting to diagnose the issue. During this time I came across several articles detailing a recall issued by GM describing the exact same issue with the brake booster/pump, ironically however, it only covered vehicle produced through 2018.   I then contacted GM customer service to alert the manufacturer and see how they would rectify the situation. I was informed that my vehicle had no open recalls and was out of warranty & there was nothing they could do for me.(handwritten call log can be provided upon request) When I contacted the dealership, they informed me they were unable to see the vehicle until the 1st week in Dec. I was left to take it to my local mechanic who, upon his diagnosis, informed me that it was the vacuum pump that had failed. As previously stated, there were no warnings prior to the failure. The \"Service Brake Assist\" appeared AFTER I managed to safely get my vehicle to a parking spot.",

Anyway, on August 15, 2021 we drove to visit family and the strong odor of freon or something got so bad that my eyes were burning and began to cough. I took the vehicle to my local dealer and explained the problem. I left the vehicle and the service person called me to say that there was nothing wrong. They did a diagnostic of the vehicle and it came back fine. He mentioned that they is a \"Service Bulletin\" on 2019 Chevrolet Equinox that stated owners may complain of a strong chemical smell inside the vehicle. He stated that GM said that there is no fix for the problem. This is unacceptable since my wife has allergies and asthma. If this chemical smell is harmful, they should recall all the vehicles affected and correct the problem. It seemed to me that GM's attitude was \"tough, live with it\".  There needs to be further investigation into this by our government and should force GM to correct this problem.  I am waiting to hear more from the dealership regarding this problem today. I don't expect to hear anything different than what they told me yesterday, (August 17).",

As any driver knows, you estimate your ability to safely turn in front of oncoming traffic based on your car's accelerator working. If I had made that judgment, attempted to turn, and not been able to accelerate and instead been left in the middle of oncoming traffic, I could have been hit and seriously injured or worse. There were no warning lights or anything that appeared prior to the incident. After losing the ability to accelerate, I received an email from Chevrolet within 10 minutes stating \"An issue with the emissions system in your 2019 Chevrolet Equinox has been detected. Please service your vehicle within 7 days.  Please disregard this message if your vehicle is already in for service. Inaccurate notifications can be generated during service.\" My car ended up being towed to the dealer for service where they confirmed and reproduced the problem.

THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR ALL DRIVERS AS EVEN WHEN LIFTING MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE THE CAR DOES NOT MOVE AS IT SHOULD IN \"DRIVE.\" INSTEAD, PLACING MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL IS REQUIRED. THIS CAUSES UNEXPECTED DELAYS IN BEGINNING TO DRIVE THAT COULD HAVE SEVERE AND LONG LASTING CONSEQUENCES. I DO NOT AT ALL FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE. THIS HAPPENS BOTH DURING CITY AND HIGHWAY DRIVING, I.E. WHEN SITTING IN TRAFFIC. OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAVE A SWITCH TO DEACTIVATE \"AUTOSTOP.\" CHEVROLET DOES NOT.
