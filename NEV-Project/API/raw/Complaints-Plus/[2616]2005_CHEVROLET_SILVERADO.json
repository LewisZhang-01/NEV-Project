So, years ago, I heard a banging noise in the right rear side of my truck. My rear shock mount rotted out and driving home later there was even more noise. The left rear shock mount rotted out also. I removed the bed to assess damage, and I couldn\u2019t believe the amount of rust I was looking at. I bought an aftermarket kit and had the shock mounts welded back on. The company selling the kit said that they sell tons of those kits. I would say that\u2019s a safety issue. Especially when the whole from appears to be rotting away. That seems like a mayor issue to me. I probably won\u2019t be buying another Chevy truck seeing how my wife\u2019s Honda is as old as my truck and has no rust under it.",

I experienced a complete loss of braking power, with the trucks brake pedal going straight to the floor, after an instant of a firm, solid pedal. Pumped the pedal to try to regain brake operation to no avail.  No hydraulic pressure was present. No warning lights or other indications of brake system failure occurred.  Truck was driven home a very short distance using e-brake. Brake fluid was seen dripping from the rear axle area in large amounts. Truck was towed to my local garage which found a burst steel brake line at the junction with the rear hydraulic flex hose. Other brake lines were heavily rusted. Rest of the undercarriage was not similarly rust like the brake lines. The garage stated this was not the first Silverado they saw with this problem. All steel lines were replaced with stainless steel lines, and as a precaution we replaced all brake hoses as well. The bleeder screws on the front disk brake calipers, and on the rear wheel cylinders were also found heavily rusted and frozen, so those components were replaced as well. The shop stated this issue of severe corrosion of brake lines and bleeders is very common on this generation of Silverado\u2019s . They have repaired quite a few like mine after similar brake failures. If you research the issue on-line, there certainly is a problem with these trucks. In my 45 years as a mechanic and practicing mechanical engineer, I have never seen brake system components so severely corroded as the ones removed from my truck. I was lucky I wasn\u2019t towing anything, or was at highway speed when the failure occurred. The next owner may not be that lucky if it happens to them.",

INCIDENT HAPPENED IN GREENVILLE, OHIO ON GARDENWOOD DR. HEADING WEST. STOPPED AT A 4 WAY STOP WITH NO INDICATION OF ANY KIND OF MUSHY BRAKES ETC. TOOK OFF FROM STOP AND ACCELERATED TO 25MPH THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT. WENT APPROXIMATELY 400 FEET, WHEN A RABBIT DARTED IN FRONT OF TRUCK. HIT THE BRAKES WITH MODERATE FIRM PRESSURE, BUT NOT EXTREME AND BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. HAD ZERO BRAKING FORCE. DUMB FOUNDED, I IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO FIND THE PARKING BRAKE PEDAL WITH MY LEFT BOOT IN THE DARK. AFTER 40 YARDS OF COASTING AND APPLYING THE PARKING BREAK WAS ABLE TO STOP THE TRUCK. THANK GOD FOR THE RABBIT, CAUSE THE ROAD DEAD ENDS INTO STATE ROUTE 118.  THE BRAKE LINE FAILED UNDER DRIVERS SIDE DOOR NEAR FRAME AND RUNS TO THE MASTER CYLINDER ASSEMBLY. AFTER REMOVING LINES, THE LINES THAT LOOKED GOOD WERE BRITTLE IN SPOTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO VISUALLY INSPECT WITHOUT REMOVING. TWO OTHER LINES THAT DIDN'T FAIL COULD BE EASILY SNAPPED IN TWO WITH ALMOST ZERO FORCE. ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM OTHER THAN THE STEEL LINES HAD BEEN REPLACED IN THE PAST 2YRS. POWER WASHED UNDER THE TRUCK AT A MINIMUM OF EVERY 6 MONTHS. SPRAYED WD 40 ON BRAKE LINES EVERY 6 MONTHS PAST 4YRS, DUE TO MECHANIC INFORMING ME THAT THE LINES COULD GO BAD ALONG FRAME AND THAT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. THOUGHT I HAD DONE A GOOD JOB AT PREVENTING SUCH AN INCIDENT. HAVE EXTENSIVE MECHANICAL SKILLS FROM EXPERIENCE, HENCE I'M REPLACING ALL THE BRAKE LINES MYSELF.  WAS A MAC TOOL DISTRIBUTOR IN THE PAST AND RAISED ON A FARM. LUCKY I HAD REPLACED THE REAR DISKS AND PARKING BRAKE SHOES, BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS THAN ADEQUATE TO STOP A FULL SIZED TRUCK IMO.

WHEN I BOUGHT THE TRUCK, I TOLD THEM SPEEDS 4 AND 5 DON'T WORK. I KNOW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THAT THE RESISTORS CAN GO OUT. THEY WOULD NOT FIX. WELL NOW, ALL ARE OUT. I MANAGED TO GET A LITTLE HOT AIR ON WINDSHIELD BUT DECIDED IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND RETURNED TO GET TRUCK THE NEXT DAY. AFTER GOOGLING \"BLOWER MOTOR FAN RELAY SWITCH\" I WAS AMAZED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR DECADES. BEFORE I RETIRED, I WORKED FOR AT&T AS A TECHNICIAN. WE DEAL WITH CORRODED WIRES AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DAMAGED BY WATER ON A DAILY BASIS. AFTER REMOVING THE RESISTER MODULE, IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS IT WAS DAMAGED BY WATER. NOT ONLY THAT, IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE PROTECTED FROM WATER BY HAVING TWO SEALS, ONE FOAM, ONE RUBBER BUILT INTO IT. OF COURSE THESE WERE PROBABLY PLACED INTO THE MODULE BY A MACHINE BECAUSE YOU COULD THEY DIDN'T FIT PROPERLY INTO THE SLOTS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO FIT IT. NOT ONLY THAT, THE WIRES THAT WERE SUPPOSE TO BE SODERED (SP) TO THE RESISTORS MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BY A MACHINE AS WELL, YOU COULD SEE THE TWO COMPONENTS WERE PRESSED TOGETHER BY SOMETHING NOT DONE BY A WORKER, AND NO SODER (SP) WAS VISIBLE. ON TOP OF THAT, AFTER TESTING ONE OF THE RESISTORS, WHICH TESTED GOOD., THE WIRE THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE MAKING CONTACT WITH THE RESISTER WAS TESTING OPEN, MEANING BAD CONNECTION. WHOEVER MADE THIS MODULE FOR GM IS AT FAULT. THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD.  *TR",

I GEARED IT DOWN MANUALLY WITH MY GEARSHIFT AND TURNED OFF THE HIGHWAY INTO A SELF-CAR WASH. AFTER LOOKING UNDER VEHICLE, I NOTICED BRAKE FLUID ALL AROUND DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL. AFTER FURTHER DETAILED INSPECTION, THE BRAKE LINE THAT RUNS FROM THE MASTER CYL TO REAR OF VEHICLE TO A UNION MOUNTED ON FRAME THAT CONVERTS SOLID LINE TO FLEX HOSE TYPE HAD CORRODED AND CRACKED. TRUCK WAS JUST INSPECTED 6 MONTHS PRIOR AT DEALER. IN MY 45 YEARS OF DRIVING PROFESSIONALLY, I HAVE NEVER HAD A BRAKE LINE FAIL FOR NO REASON, AS IT WAS UNTOUCHED AND SECURED JUST AS IT WAS WHEN IT LEFT FACTORY. ITS OBVIOUS TO ME AND EVERYONE I TALK TO THAT THE BREAK LINE IS MADE OF A LOWER QUALITY STEEL OR NOT AS THICK AS ONES PRODUCED IN THE PAST BY GM. I HAVE HEARD THAT THRU THE GRAPEVINE THAT A CERTAIN SOMEONE WHO DECIDES FAULTS IN THESE CASES SUGGESTED THAT SALT PUT ON THE ROADS IN THE WINTER COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS IF THE TRUCKS UNDERSIDE WERE NOT WASHED OFF AFTER WINTER DRIVING TO REMOVE THE CORROSIVE SALT. WHILE I WOULD AGREE TO THAT TO SOME EXTENT, BECAUSE I AM ONE WHO DOES TAKE PRIDE IN MY $ 32,000 VEHICLE, I NOT ONLY POWER WASH THE UNDERSIDE SEVERAL TIMES A WINTER, BUT ALSO UNDERCOAT IT AS WELL. WHAT MAKES THIS SO DANGEROUS, IS THAT BRAKE FLUID THAT LEAKS CAUSES MAJOR DAMAGE TO EVERYTHING IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH. MY FUEL TANK, WIRING, INSULATION AROUND WIRE, PAINT THAT PEELS OFF EVERYTHING WHICH MEANS FRAME RUST NOW. THE WORST AND MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL IS THAT THE LEAKING BRAKE FLUID TURNS PAVEMENT MADE WITH ASPHALT INTO A OIL SLICK ON THE ROAD THAT IS NOT NOTICED BY THE EVERYDAY DRIVER. AND THERE IS NO STOPPING WHATSOEVER WHEN YOU START TO SLIDE. I WANT GM TO FIX AND INSTALL THE SAFE AND CORRECT ONES, STAINLESS STEEL. THANK YOU  *TR",

I WENT AHEAD AND CALLED THE CORPORATE OFFICE OF CHEVROLET YESTERDAY, AND AFTER 3 SEPARATE CALLS, I WAS PUT IN CONTACT WITH A HIGHER-UP AND HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO HELP ME, AS THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. HE ALSO SAID THIS IS THE FIRST COMPLAINT HE HAS HEARD, \"I MEAN, COME ON, THIS IS A 10 YEAR OLD TRUCK\". DOUBT IT.  ANYWAYS, THIS A DEFINITE SAFETY CONCERN, AS I DON'T THINK MY TRUCK WOULD FARE TOO WELL IN A COLLISION. I WILL NOT LET MY 6 Y/O DAUGHTER RIDE IN IT.

WHILE BLEEDING MY BRAKES IN JUNE OF 2011, ONE OF THE REAR BRAKE LINES BURST AND THE PEDAL WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR.  THANKFULLY, THIS HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND THE BURST WAS IN A SECTION OF THE LINE ACCESSIBLE FOR ME TO REPLACE. THEN, IN AUGUST OF 2013, MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO STOP SUDDENLY AFTER SOMEONE PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME.  I WAS TRAVELING 25 TO 30 MPH.  WITH SOME MANEUVERING, I WAS ABLE TO AVOID HITTING THE PERSON BUT DRIFTED WELL THROUGH THE INTERSECTION BEFORE COMING TO A SLOW STOP.  THANKFULLY NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE.  FORTUNATELY, I COULD LITERALLY SEE MY HOUSE (AND MY CHILDREN WHO WERE WAITING FOR ME TO RETURN FROM WORK), AND WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND HAVE MY TRUCK TOWED TO A SERVICE SHOP THE NEXT DAY.  THE SHOP REPLACED A SECTION OF THE REAR BRAKE LINES AND FELT THE REMAINDER OF THE LINES WERE STILL SAFE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE BREAK WAS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN THE FIRST BRAKE LINE FAILURE.  THE THIRD BRAKE LINE FAILURE OCCURRED ON DECEMBER 5TH, 2014 WHEN MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO COME TO A SUDDEN STOP WHEN ANOTHER DRIVER CAME INTO MY LANE WITHOUT WARNING.  AGAIN I WAS TRAVELING 25 TO 30 MPH AND NEARLY RAN HEAD ON INTO ANOTHER DRIVER AFTER MY TRUCK DRIFTED SLOWLY TO A STOP (PROBABLY TOOK 3 TIMES THE DISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE NORMALLY TAKEN TO STOP).  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, MY VEHICLE HAD ROUGHLY 67,100 MILES ON IT.  ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL BRAKE LINE SYSTEM WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  SEEING THE OTHER COMPLAINTS FILED FOR CHEVROLET SILVERADO?S AND GMC SIERRA'S, I SINCERELY HOPE THAT SOMETHING IS DONE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED BY THESE FAILING BRAKE LINES.  *TR",

WE HAD 2 OTHER FORD CARS IN THE PAST THAT HAD NEARLY 200,000 MILES WHEN WE GOT RID OF THEM,AND THEY STILL HAD THE SAME BRAKES LINES,WHICH LOOKED GOOD FOR BEING NEARLY 15 YEARS OLD EACH. I KNOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ISSUE, BUT GM APPARENTLY PUT POOR QUALITY LINES ON VARIOUS VEHICLES. WE RARELY DRIVE IT ON SALTY ROADS IN THE WINTER,AND WHEN WE DO,WE REGULARLY DO A UNDERCARRIAGE WASH,WHICH WASN'T AVAILABLE WHEN WE HAD THE 2 PREVIOUS FORD CARS. IT IS VERY OBVIOUS THE LINES PUT ON THESE VEHICLES ARE JUNK. THEY PUT ON A EXHAUST THAT IS SUPPOSED TO LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE,BUT PUT ON INFERIOR BRAKE LINES WHICH ARE A SAFETY ISSUE,GO FIGURE. AFTER SEEING HOW GM STONEWALLED AND BRUSHED OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH ISSUE,AND NOW THIS BRAKE LINE ISSUE,ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M GOING BACK TO A FORD. I ALWAYS DO PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE,BUT THESE BRAKE LINES CAUGHT ME WAY OFF GUARD. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF BRAKE LINES OVER THE YEARS BUT NONE THIS SOON.

AFTER DRIVING IT ON SALTED ROADS SO THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE RUSTED. THE PROBLEM IS IT APPEARS THESE ARE BARE STEEL LINES WITH NO APPARENT COATING ON THEM TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING. AS EVERYONE KNOWS ANY BARE STEEL WILL RUST EXTENSIVELY WHEN NOT COATED WITH A PAINT OR SOME FORM OF CORROSION PROTECTION. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE BRAKE LINES WERE NOT TREATED I WOULD HAVE SPRAYED UNDERCOAT OR SOMETHING ON THEM TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING. THE GM DEALER THAT HAS DONE ALL MY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS NEVER LEFT ME KNOW THEY WERE RUSTING WHILE IT WAS UNDER THE 100,000 EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD. I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS FOR ASSISTANCE AND THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR MY BRAKE LINES, THIS IS A SAFETY ITEM AND THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL TRUCKS NO MATTER HOW NEW OR NOMATTER HOW OLD THAT HAS THESE CHEAP STEEL LINES ON THEM. I TOOK A 700 MILE ROUND TRIP AND I DIDN'T KNOW MY BRAKE FLUID WAS LEAKING UNTIL I GOT HOME AND SAW THE FLUID RUNNING DOWN THE FRAME ONTO THE DRIVEWAY. WHEN I PUSHED ON THE BRAKES THE BRAKE FLUID GUSHED OUT REAL BAD. MY RESERVOIR WAS HALF EMPTY AND NO WARNING LIGHT CAME ON TO LET ME KNOW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I WAS TOWING A SNOWMOBILE TRAILER AND WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY I DIDNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I HAD TO BRAKE HARD. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND SHOULD   BE ADDRESSED AND RECALLED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  *TR",

I ATTRIBUTED IT TO EVAPORATION & ADDED COOLANT. OVER TIME THE TRUCK STARTED USING MORE & MORE ANTIFREEZE. A FRIEND OF MINE NOTICED A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM THE TAILPIPE. AT THE TIME I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ANYTHING OF IT. LAST WEEK WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AFTER FINISHING UP A \"B\" TRICK JOB (11PM), I NOTICED A KNOCKING SOUND COMING FROM THE ENGINE. IT SMOOTHED OUT AFTER A FEW MILES OF DRIVING IT. THE NEXT DAY IT HAPPENED AGAIN ( I WORK 26 MILES FROM HOME) AGAIN IT SMOOTHED OUT & I WAS JUST GRATEFUL I GOT HOME SAFELY THAT NIGHT. BY THIS TIME I KNEW THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES & DECIDED NOT TO DRIVE IT AGAIN. I BEGAN RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ON LINE & FOUND OTHERS THAT WERE EXPERIENCING IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS. TURNS OUT THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE CYLINDER HEADS IN THE ENGINE MANUFACTURED FOR GM BY CASTECH. ACCORDING TO OTHER PEOPLE & BY GMS OWN ADMISSION, A FAULTY, WEAK MATERIAL WAS USED TO BUILD THE CYLINDER HEADS. OVER TIME THE MATERIAL WEARS AWAY CAUSING POROUS CRACKS & THE ANTIFREEZE SEEPS INTO THE OIL SYSTEM POLLUTING IT, CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE. (BY THIS TIME MOST EXTENDED WARRANTIES ARE UP). THE ANTIFREEZE MIXES WITH THE OIL & IS EMITTED OUT OF THE TAILPIPE AS EXHAUST. THIS IS WHY NO TRACES OF ANTIFREEZE WERE FOUND & THE REASON FOR THE WHITE PUFF OF SMOKE. GM ISSUED A BULLETIN #06-06-01-019B IN JUNE 2007 INFORMING REPAIR TECHNICIANS ON WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE DAMAGE. THROUGH OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES, I AM FINDING THE ENGINES WERE RUINED IN 90% OF THE CASES & GM CLAIMS NO RESPONSIBILITY. IN MY CASE I AM DRIVING A FRIEND'S VEHICLE WAITING ON WORD FROM MY MECHANIC AS TO MY OPTIONS. THESE REPAIRS ARE COSTLY. UP TO $5000!! THIS IS NOT FROM NORMAL WEAR & TEAR THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT & I FEEL A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  *KB",

UPON DRIVING THEVEHICLE FOR THREE MONTHS, MY SPEEDOMETER STARTED STICKING INTERMITTENTLY, BUT WOULD RESET. SINCE, MY SPEEDOMETER STICKS ON A DAILY BASIS, SOMETIMES ALL DAY. THE ONLY REMEDY HAS BEEN TO TURN MY VEHICLE OFF AND BACK ON, WHERE AS MY SPEEDOMETER GOES DOWN AT FIVE MILE PER HOUR INCREMENTS UNTIL BACK AT ZERO. IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS, MY TACHOMETER HAS ALSO MALFUNCTIONED AND DOES NOT READ AT TIMES, THEREFORE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING NOR HOW HIGH MY ENGINE IS IDLING OR INCREASING/DECREASING IN SPEED. THERE IS NO APPARENT EVENT LEADING UP TO THE FAILURE AND MY CONCLUSION IS THAT THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER IS DEFECTIVE IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR I WAS TRAVELING IN OKLAHOMA DURING A SUDDEN SNOW STORM IN WHICH TRAFFIC WAS TRAVELING AT AN ESTIMATED 20-30 MILES PER HOUR. I ACCELERATED TO AN UNKNOWN SPEED, HOWEVER NOT EXCESSIVELY. I LOST CONTROL AND MY VEHICLE SLIDE ACROSS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC OPPOSITE THE LANE I WAS IN AND I SLIDE INTO A DITCH IN WHICH MY BOTTOM AIR DAM WAS TORN OFF. I WAS ABLE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE HOWEVER I ONLY ACCELERATED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS TRAVELING AT TEN MILES PER HOUR. WHEN MY VEHICLE CAME TO A REST IN THE DITCH, MY SPEEDOMETER WAS STILL AT TEN MILES PER HOUR. A STATE TROOPER DID ASSIST ME BY GETTING A TOW TRUCK, HOWEVER NO REPORT WAS FILED BY ME. I BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD KNOW HOW FAST I WAS GOING, THIS MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED. IT IS INCONCLUSIVE, HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THE MALFUNCTION IS A SAFETY CONCERN. I HAVE PRICED THE REPLACEMENT, WHICH IS THE ONLY REMEDY, AT OR ABOUT $450-700 AND THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED MALFUNCTION. I HAVE RESEARCHED AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY, MANY CASES OF THIS VERY DEFECT IN THE SAME MODEL TRUCK FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER AND BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE A RECALL, NOT A \"SPECIAL PROVISION\" DU TO THE MANUFACTURERS KNOWING SINCE 2003 ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DEFECT. *TR",

I CALLED THE CHEVROLET HOT LINE NUMBER AND THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THIS PART. I THEN WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD REPLACEMENT PARTS IN STOCK DUE TO THE FREQUENCY OF THE PART BEING PURCHASED. THIS PART WAS REPLACED AND 2 MONTHS AFTERWARDS THE AIR CONDITIONING AND HEAT WENT OUT AGAIN, BUT WAS NOT THE SAME PART. THIS TIME THE FAN MOTOR WAS DIAGNOSED AS THE PROBLEM. I HAVE NOT FIXED THIS PART DUE TO MYSELF NOT FEELING IT IS MY OBLIGATION TO SPEND SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS FIXING STUFF THAT IS COMMON THROUGHOUT TRUCK OF THE SAME YEAR AND MAKE. THIS PART THAT WAS REPLACED GOT VERY HOT AND SMOKED WHEN GOING OUT. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THIS PART CATCHING ON FIRE AND MY CHILD NOT ABLE TO RIDE IN MY VEHICLE DURING HOT SUMMER MONTHS DUE TO PARTS MESSING UP CONSTANTLY. BY THE WAY NO FUSE EVERY BURN UP IN THIS PROCESS UNTIL AFTER FAN MOTOR WENT OUT. THE SECOND ISSUE I HAVE IS THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ON MY TRUCK. THE ENGINE HOURS METER HAS RESET TWICE NOW WHICH WASN'T A BIG DEAL, BUT THE GEAR SELECTION ON THE DASH IS NOW STARTING TO NOT WORK PROPERLY.  I RECENTLY WENT TO LEAVE FROM WORK AND WENT PUTTING THE TRUCK IN DRIVE THE INDICATION ON THE DASH STAYED IN PARK. THE TRUCK WAS IN GEAR THOUGH BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED UNTIL AFTER GETTING ON THE ROAD. I PULLED OVER AND WENT BACK TO PARK WITH THE SHIFTER. AFTER DOING SO THE INDICATION WORKED. I AM AFRAID THAT THIS WILL START HAPPENING MORE FREQUENT ALONG WITH THE ENGINE HOURS CLEARING.

AT THAT TIME I CALLED IN THE DEALERSHIP TOM JUMPER WHERE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IT WOULD COST ABOUT $600 TO GET THIS FIXED. THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A LITIGATION AGAINST GM FOR THE SPEEDOMETER ISSUE AND HAD ME CALL GM DIRECTLY TO GET THIS ISSUE FIXED TO AVOID OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. THIS DEALERSHIP HAS CLOSED AND OUT OF BUSINESS. I DID CALL GM ACCORDING TO THEM THERE HAS BEEN LITIGATION GOING ON AND THEY DIRECTED TO ME TO THIS WEBSITE TO FIND OUT THE STATUS PERIODICALLY. THE WEBSITE NOW INFORMS THAT THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT NOTICE ISSUED AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PAID FOR THIS REPAIR WORK SHOULD CLAIM THEIR REIMBURSEMENTS. I REFUSE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND ASKED THEM TO GET MY VEHICLE FIXED AS ITS A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM ON SUPPLYING DEFECTIVE PARTS. THEY ARE ASKING ME TO GO TO CHEVY DEALER AND GET IT DIAGNOSED PAID BY ME AND THEN THEY WILL DETERMINE IF THEY I AM ELIGIBLE FOR THIS REPAIR WORK. I FOUND THIS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND FRAUDULENT AS PER KEEPING THEIR CLIENT AS A HOSTAGE TO THEIR DEMANDS.

THIS CAUSED THE STARTLED DRIVER TO WILDLY SWERVE BACK AND FORTH INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEHIND ME AND ALMOST CAUSE A HEAD-ON COLLISION. ON A MORE MINOR NOTE: THESE CAPS ARE A $70/ PIECE FACTORY ONLY ITEM WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY WHEN THEY FLY OFF, BUT ARE NOT! *JB",

SINCE OUR TRUCK HAS A STANDARD TRANSMISSION, THE DRIVER SIMPLY \"POPPED\" THE CLUTCH AND THE ENGINE STARTED.  ABOUT 10 MILES LATER, THE ENGINE STALLED SEVERAL MORE TIMES CAUSING THE ENGINE TO QUIT AGAIN FORCING US TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER.  WE CHECKED THE BATTERY CABLES, BUT THE ENGINE WOULD NOT TURN OVER. AFTER A FEW MINUTES THE ENGINE STARTED, BUT CONTINUED TO STALL.  WHILE IN NEUTRAL,THE RPM'S WERE JUMPING OVER 3000 THEN FALLING BELOW 500.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE BATTERY GAGE WAS READING NEARLY NOTHING.  NO WARNING  OR CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS EVER APPEARED .  SINCE WE WERE IN ANOTHER STATE 500 MILES FROM HOME, OUR ONLY CHOICE WAS TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE COULD FIND A GM MECHANIC.  THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO STALL AND MISFIRE FOR ANOTHER 60 MILES.  SINCE WE WERE A MERE 702 MILES OVER OUR FACTORY WARRANTY,  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US WE WOULD HAVE TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT, AND THE NEXT OPENING WOULD BE IN 8 DAYS.  INSTEAD,WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A LOCAL MECHANIC SHOP, AND IN A MATTER OF MINUTES THE MECHANIC FOUND THE CAUSE OF THE STALLING TO BE A WIRE THAT PLUGS INTO THE COIL PACK.  HE CALLED THE GM DEALERSHIP FOR A REPLACEMENT, AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND IT WOULD TAKE A WEEK OR MORE TO ARRIVE.  THE MECHANIC TOLD US THE FACTORY WIRE WAS NOT NECESSARY,  HE COULD SIMPLY SPLICE INTO THE WIRE TO FIX OUR PROBLEM.  SINCE STAYING AN ADDITIONAL WEEK WAS NOT AN OPTION, WE AGREED TO HAVE THE MECHANIC FIX THE WIRE BY SPLICING IT.    WE BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR STALLING 10,000 MILES LATER.  THERE ARE 2 WIRES THAT ENTER THE SAME CLIP THEN PLUGS INTO THE COIL.  THE CAUSE OF STALLING THE SECOND TIME WAS THE WIRE OPPOSITE OF THE ONE REPLACED BEFORE.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE A DEFECT IN THE COIL ITSELF, OR MERELY LOW-QUALITY WIRES INSTALLED BY GM.  *NM",

AFTER CHECKING THIS OUT ON THE INTERNET, IT SEEMS THAT GM HAS THIS PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THE TRUCKS/SUVS FROM THE MODEL RUN 1999 TO THE FINISH OF THE MODEL RUN 2006. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SHAFT THAT CONNECTS THE IN- CAB STEERING ASSEMBLY TO THE STEERING BOX IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. IT STARTS OFF WITH AN OCCASIONAL ANNOYING CLUNK AND PROGRESSING TO A FULL TIME NOISE THAT CAN BE HEARD AND FELT IN THE STEERING WHEEL. I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS IN THE COLLAPSIBLE PART OF THE SHAFT AS GM'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO LUBRICATE THE SPLINES IN THE SHAFT AND / OR REPLACE IT. WHETHER THE ORIGINAL SHAFT IS REPAIRED (LUBRICATED) OR A NEW ONE IS INSTALLED, WITHIN 2K TO 15K MILES THE DEFECT IS BACK.

IT WOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN I WAS ACCELERATING FROM A STOP.  BASICALLY, I WOULD GIVE THE TRUCK GAS AND THE ENGINE WOULD REV UP TO ABOUT 2,000 RPM'S, WITHOUT THE VEHICLE MOVING, AND THEN IT WOULD ALL OF THE SUDDEN MAKE A LOUD THUD SOUND AND THEN LURCH FORWARD, AS IF IT WAS NOT IN GEAR AND THEN ALL OR THE SUDDEN PUT INTO DRIVE.  THIS CAN'T BE GOOD FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE ENGINE.  I CALLED THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND ASKED THEM IF I BROUGHT MY TRUCK IN IF THEY COULD LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD, BUT IF THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM OR IF THERE WAS NOT ANY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM TO FIX IT.  THE SLIPPING OF MY TRANSMISSION HAS OCCURRED ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES.  THE PROBLEM IS IT WORKS FINE MOST OF THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN IT SLIPS.  SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN.  I COULD STOP AND ACCELERATE 100 TIMES AND IT WON'T SLIP.  THEN JUST OUT OF THE BLUE IT WILL DECIDE TO SLIP, AND MAKE THAT TERRIBLE BANGING THUD OF THE TRANSMISSION ENGAGEMENT.
