NOW I SEE A CORRELATION WITH THE 2000 QUEST I HAVE NOW. THE LOW PROFILE OF MY QUEST CAUSED MY TRANSMISSION PAN TO LEAK FLUID, BECAUSE OF A DIP IN THE ROAD.  CONSTANT PROBLEMS WHEN PARKING DUE TO THE FRONT END OF MY QUEST BEING TOO LOW AND SCRAPING THE CURB.  PROBLEM WITH HEATING SYSTEM IN THE REAR, ONLY BLOWS OUT COLD AIR REGARDLESS OF SETTING IT TO HEAT.  THERE IS A VERY STRONG GAS SMELL WHEN MY CAR IS RUNNING (THIS WAS ALSO EXPERIENCED IN MY 1993 QUEST)  ONLY COMPACT INCIDENT WAS WHEN MY TRANMISSION PAN CRACKED GOING DOWN THE STREET AND GOING DOWN A DIP IN THE ROAD (NOT A POT HOLE).

EXPERIENCE TO DATE IS THAT IT REQUIRES EXCESSIVE FORCE TO PRESS OR BECOMES IMMOVABLE WHEN TRYING TO DEPRESS THE PEDAL FROM ITS  UNDEPRESSED POSITION, SUCH AS WHEN THE ENGINE IS IDLING WHILE THE CAR IS NOT MOVING OR ROLLING AFTER ONE'S FOOT HAS ALLOWED THE PEDAL TO COME UP. I RECENTLY RECEIVED A NOTICE OF CLASS ACTION AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT, LOS ANGELES COUNTY (ROBERT MEYER V. NISSAN NORTH AMERICA) IN WHICH PLAINTIFF ALLEGED THAT EXCESSIVE CARBONOUS DEPOSITS FORM ON 1999 AND 2000 NISSAN QUESTS IN THE \"THROTTLE-BODY ASSSEMBLY\" AND THAT THESE DEPOSITS MAY CAUSE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO STICK.  IF A DEFECT IS JUDGED BY THE OCCURRENCE RELATIVE TO OTHER VEHICLES THIS SEEMS A STRONG CANDIDATE.  AND THE DESIGN DEFECT THAT ALLOWS THIS OCCURRENCE PERMITS AN INOPERABLE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WHICH CAN PRESENT A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THE CLASS ACTION NOTICE RECEIVED INDICATES THAT NISSAN WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUE SINCE AT LEAST OCTOBER 2000 WHEN IT ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ADVISING ON A CLEANING PROCEDURE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY OUTSIDE THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD NISSAN SHIFTS THE COSTS OF COMPENSATING FOR ITS POOR, DEFECTIVE DESIGN TO THE CONSUMER BY CONSIDERING IT AS MATTER OF ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IN THEIR MAINTENANCE OR OWNERS MANUALS RECEIVED DURING THE PURCHASE OF THEIR PRODUCT.  NOR, FOR THAT MATTER, DOES THIS PROBLEM PRESENT ITSELF IN OTHER VEHICLES IS WHICH SUCH \"MAINTENANCE\" IS NOT NEEDED.  *AK",
