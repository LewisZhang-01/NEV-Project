MY HUSBAND HAD TO CONTINUE TO SWITCH THE LIGHTS OFF AND ON WHILE DRIVING TO GET THE LIGHTS TO STAY ON. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST; HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT DURING ADVERSE DRIVING CONDITIONS. ABOUT A WEEK LATER, AS I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE BLACK HILLS AT NIGHT (WHERE WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF WILDLIFE), I EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. I RESEARCHED A RESOLUTION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MIGHT BE WRONG WITH THE HEADLIGHTS, THINKING IT MIGHT BE A LOOSE WIRE OR BAD BULBS. DURING MY RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN IN 2011 (TCS-11-030) RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM.  WE PURCHASED OUR VEHICLE IN NOVEMBER 2012, WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AROUND 47,000 MILES. HAD WE KNOWN ABOUT THIS SERVICE BULLETIN WHEN WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2012, WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE ISSUE ADDRESSED. HOWEVER, SINCE WE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RECALL AND HAVE NOT UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, DURING DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS, HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE LIGHTING, WE DID NOT ADDRESS IT. WHEN I CALLED TOYOTA TODAY, I WAS TOLD THAT, DUE TO OUR MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE (100,000 NOW), OUR VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED THAT WAS ISSUED (UNBEKNOWNST TO US) IN 2011. I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALER IN OUR AREA FOR DIAGNOSIS (AT OUR EXPENSE) AND POSSIBLY SOMETHING COULD BE DONE IF THE DIAGNOSIS REVEALED THAT OUR HEADLIGHT ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE RECALL IN 2011 (THE RECALL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES AVALONS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010).  AS I EXPLAINED TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP, WE MAY HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE DURING THE DAY BUT DIDN'T KNOW DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T RELY ON THE LIGHTS DURING DAYTIME.  *TR",

MY SON-IN-LAW LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAID, 'YOU HAVE A HEADLIGHT OUT'.  IT WAS THE RIGHT FRONT HEADLAMP.  I GOT IN THE CAR AND TURNED THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF AND TURNED IT BACK ON TO 'AUTO' AND BOTH HEADLIGHTS CAME ON ONCE AGAIN.  HOWEVER, I HAD TO TURN THEM OFF AND TURN THEM BACK ON TO GET THEM BOTH WORKING.    ON JANUARY 16, 2011, MY WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW AND MYSELF WERE LEAVING A RESTAURANT.  I AGAIN USED MY REMOTE START AND STARTED THE CAR.  I WALKED PAST THE FRONT OF THE CAR ON MY WAY TO THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND WOULD HAVE NOTICED A LIGHT OUT BUT I DID NOT.  APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE RESTAURANT, WE ENTERED A DARK AREA AND WE NOTICED WE COULD HARDLY SEE THE ROAD.  I SAID TO MY WIFE, I THINK I HAVE A HEADLIGHT OUT?  I AGAIN TURNED THE HEADLIGHTS OFF AND BACK ON TO THE AUTO POSITION AND THEY BOTH CAME ON ALLOWING US TO SEE THE ROAD AGAIN.  THIS TIME IT WAS THE LEFT FRONT HEADLAMP THAT WENT OUT.

WHEN THE DOOR OPENS, IT DROPS ABOUT A HALF AN INCH.  WHEN THE DOOR CLOSES, IT HITS AGAINST THE FRAME OF THE CAR AND THE FRAME PUSHES IT UP INTO THE POSITION WHERE THE DOOR WILL LATCH CLOSED.  IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE HINGES OF THE DOOR WERE NO LONGER WELDED TO THE CAR.  THE ONLY THING HOLDING THE DOOR ON THE CAR IS THE SCREWS.  I RECENTLY TOOK THE CAR IN TO BE REPAIRED ONLY TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP INFORM ME THAT THEY COULD NOT REPAIR IT AT THEIR LOCATION, AND THAT THE HINGES HAD COME UNWELDED FROM THE CAR AND HAD BEEN BENT BY ?AN OUTSIDE FORCE? AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY TIGHTENED THE SCREWS ON THE HINGES AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.  I HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT IN THIS CAR NOR HAVE I DONE ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE ENOUGH ?OUTSIDE FORCE? TO BREAK THE WELDING AND BEND THE HINGES, WHICH MEANS THAT TOYOTA SOLD ME A CAR THAT WAS DAMAGED, AND COULD BE UNSAFE.  EITHER THE HINGES ARE DEFECTED OR THE CAR WAS INVOLVED AN ACCIDENT EVEN THOUGH THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN.    EITHER THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T INSPECT IT TO SEE IF THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE CAR, OR THEY KNEW THAT THE HINGES HAD BEEN BENT, THEY TIGHTENED THE SCREWS AND SOLD THE CAR TO ME ANYWAY.  THEN AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF OPENING AND CLOSING THE DOOR, THE SCREWS BEGAN TO LOOSEN  SINCE THE HINGES WERE ALREADY BENT AND DETACHED FROM THE BODY OF THE CAR.    WHETHER THIS ISSUE WAS OVERLOOKED, OR PURPOSELY KEPT FROM ME, EITHER WAY, THEY SOLD ME A CAR THAT HAD DAMAGES THAT COULD PRESENT A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IF THE SCREWS, THE ONLY THING CURRENTLY HOLDING THE DOOR TO THE CAR, WERE TO GIVE WAY UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE DOOR, THE WHOLE DOOR COULD THEORETICALLY COME OFF AT ANY TIME. *TR",

WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT THE LASER CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM ADJUSTS ON THE CRUISE CONTROL LEVEL IN 5 MPH INCREMENTS UP OR DOWN.  HOWEVER, IF YOU TAP THE LEVER UP MORE THAN ONCE IT WILL INCREASE THE SPEED BY 5, 10, 15, 20 MPH.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU HOLD THE CRUISE LEVEL FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS, THE CRUISE SETTING CONTINUES TO INCREMENT AND IN JUST A FEW SECONDS YOU MAY HAVE UNKNOWINGLY INCREASED THE SETTING FOR THE CRUISE BY 20 OR 25 MPH.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS SINCE OLDER MODELS OF MOST CARS, INCLUDING TOYOTAS, JUST INCREMENT YOUR SPEED BY A FEW M.P.H. AS YOU HOLD THE CRUISE CONTROL LEVEL UP TO GET TO THE DESIRED CRUISING SPEED.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE OWNERS MANUAL IS INACCURATE AND DOES NOT DESCRIBE HOW THE RESETTING OF THE CRUISE SPEED ACTUALLY WORKS.  IN MY OPINION THE CRUISE CONTROL LEVEL SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO INCREASE YOUR SET CRUISING SPEED BY 20 OR 30 MPH BY LIFTING UP THE CRUISE LEVEL OR A FEW SECONDS.

WHEN SELECTING OPTIONS FOR MY CAR, I ASKED FOR FLOORMATS WHICH WERE CLEARLY SHOWN IN THE AVALON'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL.  WHEN THE AVALON CAME (OCT 2007) IT DID NOT HAVE THE REQUESTED FLOOR MATS.  I ASKED THE DEALER ABOUT THIS AND HE SIMPLY SAID THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I POINTED OUT THAT THEY WERE IN THE AVALON BOOKLET AND HE AGAIN SAID THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I THEN DID WHAT MOST PROBABLY DID, BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEIR NEW CAR, AND THAT WAS TO PURCHASE FLOORMATS AT AN AUTO SUPPLY.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE AUTOMAKER CLEARLY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH FLOORMATS AT LEAST 2 AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND DID NOT WARN ME OF THIS NOR ANYONE ELSE.  THIS RESULTED IN TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME.  I THINK THEY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WITHHOLDING THIS INFORMATION UNTIL AFTER THERE WERE DEATHS RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

AS HE WAS COMING OUT OF THE CAR WASH, HE SHIFT FROM NEUTRAL TO DRIVE AND THE ACCELERATOR FAILED , STICKING IN FULL THROTTLE,CAUSING HIM TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  TO AVOID  COLLISION WITH OTHER VEHICLES COMING OUT OF THE GAS STATION, WHICH IS PART OF THE BUSINESS, AND HITTING PEDESTRIANS AND THE GAS PUMPS, HE STEERED THE CAR HITTING A POLE, GOING OVER EMBANKMENT, THE SIDEWALK AND INTO ONGOING TRAFFIC IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  THE CAR CAME TO A STOP TWO BUSINESS DOWN FROM WHERE THE ACCIDENT ORIGINATED.    DAMAGES WAS DONE TO ALL 4 TIRESWITH BENT RIMS,  THE FRONT RIGHT AND LEFT BUMPER AND GRILLE, THE HOOD, THE LAMP GROUND WITH THE HEAD LIGHT KNOCKED OUT. THE DRIVER'S SIDE MIRROR WAS HANGING DOWN.  THE EXHAUST SYSTEM (MUFFLER, TAILPIPES) WERE DAMAGED.  THE REAR FENDER AND BUMPER WAS DAMAGED.  THE BATTERY, OIL PAN, REAR ENGINE CRADLE CUSHION PIPES WERE REPLACED.  AT THE TIME, WE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE DID, BUT WE NOW SINCE HAVE FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAS HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL STICKING IN FULL THROTTLE  AND HAVE ASKED FOR A RECALL.  THE TOTAL DAMAGE WAS TO A SUM OF $12,226.39.  THE INSURANCE AND REPAIR COMPANY HAVE FIXED THE CAR AT OUR EXPENSE AND THE OLD OR REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.   I HAVE ONLY PHOTOS OF THE CAR IN THE DAMAGED STATE.   I  DID GO TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM  AND THEY PLAN TO START  REPAIRS FEB. 15. 2010.

THESE, ALONG WITH OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM, OCCUR EVERY TIME IT IS ENGAGED.  WHEN FIRST PRESENTED TO THE DEALER IN PHONE CONVERSATION WAS TOLD IT WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION TO NEWS REPORTS AND GIVEN AN 800 NUMBER TO A RECORDED MESSAGE TELLING ME IF I HAVE A PROBLEM STOP MY CAR AND REPORT IT TO MY DEALER. I THEN WENT TO THE DEALER AND WAS THEN TREATED WITH DISBELIEF. THEIR INITIAL SOLUTION WAS DENIAL THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. AFTER DEMANDING A MECHANIC TEST DRIVE THE CAR, THE TECHNICIAN CONCEDED THE PROBLEM IS EXACTLY AS I DESCRIBED. I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THEIR IN SHOP DIAGNOSTIC TEST SHOWED THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE LASER CRUISE. AND WHEN I QUESTIONED THIS WAS INCREDIBLY ASKED IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE TECHNOLOGY WHEN THEIR OWN MECHANIC VERIFIED THAT IN REALITY THE SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING DURING THE ROAD TEST.THEN THEY DECIDED TO TAKE ANOTHER TACTIC. THERE IS A 1/2 INCH DING IN THE FRONT BUMPER OF MY CAR THAT IS THE RESULT OF MY CAR ROLLING 5 FEET WHILE IN NEUTRAL AND TAPPING A POLE. THEY DECIDED TO BLAME THE MALFUNCTION ON THIS MINUTE DING EVEN THOUGH I INFORMED THEM THAT THE MALFUNCTION DID NOT CORRELATE WITH THE TIME OF THE BLEMISH TO THE CAR. NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT, OVER $3000, TO FIX THIS DING, HOPING IT WILL DETER ME FROM PURSUING THE ISSUE OF THE INNATE FLAWS IN TOYOTA'S LASER MECHANISM. I KNOW THIS WILL NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT AM INSTRUCTING THEM TO REPAIR THE BUMPER AS A MEANS OF GUARANTEEING THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO MY  LASER CRUISE PROBLEM. I WILL PAY TO FIX MY DLCC, NOT CORRECT A BLEMISH IN MY BUMPER.

AT HOME  AT 8 AM, ON THE CLEAR, COOL DAY OF 11/1/2009 I HAD THE CAR PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY TO INSTALL THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER. WANTING TO MOVE THE CAR TO THE STREET I STARTED THE CAR USING THE REQUIRED PROCEEDURE FOR A PUSHBUTTON IGNITION (LIKE ON MY 2007 TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRID FOR 2 1/2 YEARS). THAT IS,  I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AND PUSHED THE IGNITION BUTTON SIMULTAENEOUSLY. THE CAR STARTED TO MOVE RAPIDLY DOWN MY SHORT SLOPING DRIVEWAY  (7 OR 8 FEET).  AS I PUSHED HARDER, THE BREAK PEDAL IN EFFECT WENT TO THE FLOOR- NO BREAKING AT ALL.  I HIT THE CURB VERY HARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF  THE NARROW STREET, THE REAR END OF THE CAR BOUNCING INTO THE AIR , AND ENDED UP, PERHAPS 10 FEET BEYOND, HITTING THE FRONT BEDROOM  WALL OF MY NEIGHBOR'S HOME WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE WALL. I APPARENTLY DID NOT SUSTAIN PHYSICAL DAMAGE. I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS AN ACCELERATOR COMPONENT PROBLEM ALSO BECAUSE I WAS MOVING SO FAST.    THE CAR IS BEING REPAIRED NOW PHYSICALLY, AS IS THE HOUSE, AND I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA LOCALLY IN TORRANCE AND I UNDERSTAND SOMEONE THERE WILL FOLLOW-UP ON THIS ACCIDENT WITHIN THE NEXT 4 DAYS.    I  TRIED TO DUPLICATE THE BRAKE FAILURE PROBLEM WITH MY CAMRY HYBRID  AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT. WHEN PRESSING ON THE START BUTTON AND THE BRAKE AT THE SAME TIME I ALWAYS HAVE A FIRM BRAKE ON THE CAMRY.  WHEN I DUPLICATED THE PROCEEDURE ON THE AVALON I FOUND THAT THE BRAKE  PEDAL WENT SOFT  RAPIDLY, THE MORE I PUSHED IT, TO THE FLOOR.    MY REPAIR SHOP WILL NOT DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL SOMETHING IS RESOLVED,  NOR WILL I.  I WILL BE GLAD TO FURNISH ANYTHING MORE YOU MAY WISH TO KNOW ABOUT THIS INCIDENT.   *TR",

WHEN STOPPING ON ANY INCLINE I DISCOVERED THAT UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL KEY USED FOR THE IGNITION THAT IT IS POSSIBILE TO STOP THE CAR WITHOUT PUTTING IT INTO PARK. THE KEY SYSTEM FORCES YOU TO PUT THE CAR INTO PARK IN ORDER TO GET THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION.. THE NEW ONE DOES NOT. I WAS DISTRACTED BY MY WIFE AND A NEW PUPPY WHICH WAS ABOUT TO VOMIT AND WANTED OUT OF THE CAR.  WHEN I STOPPED I FAILED TO PUT THE CAR INTO PARK AND WHILE WE OPENED THE DOORS THE CAR STARTED TO ROLL AND COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY.I REALIZE THIS COULD HAPPEN WITH THE OLD KEY SYSTEM . HOWEVER, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOT LESS LIKELY IN THE \"OLD\" KEY SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THE NEW KEY LESS SYSTEM IS THEREFORE A DESIGN DEFECT AND A SERIUOS ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.*CN",
