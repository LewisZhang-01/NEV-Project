THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BROCHURE AND LETTER I RECEIVED, HE  TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER AIRBAG AND SHOWED ME THAT THEY HAD ALREADY ADDRESSED A PREVIOUS RECALL WITH THE AIRBAG ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

THE DURABILITY OF THE EXCEL AND THE WARRANTY ON THE ELANTRA WERE THE REASON I CHOSE TO BUY IT.  AT 13,000 MILES IN APRIL, 2005, THE CLUTCH ON THE ELANTRA BEGAN SLIPPING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CLUTCH IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE 100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  IT IS COVERED ONLY UNDER A 12,000 MILE WARRANTY.  AFTER NEGOTIATION WITH THE MANAGEMENT, THE DEALERSHIP AGREED TO COVER 50% OF THE REPAIR.  THIS WAS ACCEPTABLE AT THAT TIME AND THE PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE CORRECTED.  IT IS NOW AUGUST, 2006, AND THIS VEHICLE HAS 33,066 MILES ON IT AND CLUTCH #2 IS WEARING OUT.  STARTING OUT IN LOW GEAR IS DIFFICULT, THE CLUTCH SLIPS IN THE LOWER GEARS (2 AND 3)  AND THE CLUTCH PEDAL IS EXTREMELY STIFF.  AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THE VEHICLE PERFORMS OK.  I AM AFRAID TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER SINCE THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY GOING TO PUT THE SAME PIECE OF JUNK CLUTCH IN AS A REPLACEMENT TO THIS ONE.  I HAVE TALKED TO AN INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION SHOP AND THEY CAN USE A NON-OEM PART TO REPLACE.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS SOLUTION IS THAT THE COST IS GOING TO BE +$1000 VERSUS THE $800+ THAT THE DEALER WILL CHARGE AND THE USE OF THE NON-OEM PART MAY VOID THE VEHICLE WARRANTY. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW OTHER FACTS:  THE 1994 EXCEL WENT TO 122,000 MILES BEFORE NEEDING ITS CLUTCH REPLACED.  THE REPLACEMENT CLUTCH WAS STILL IN THE CAR WHEN IT WAS TRADED IN AT 176,000 MILES.  MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING STANDARD SHIFT VEHICLES EXCLUSIVELY SINCE 1990, SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE AT HYUNDAI SUGGESTING THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A STANDARD SHIFT VEHICLE.

THE GLASS IS LABELED: KOREA AUTOGLASS LAMINATED A.  WE ASSUME THAT THE MARKS WERE THE RESULT OF STONES OR SIMILAR OBJECTS WHICH FLEW UP AND HIT THE WINDSHIELD WHILE ONE OF US WAS DRIVING.  WE DID NOT WITNESS THE EVENT.   WITHIN A FEW DAYS, WE NOTICED THAT A SURFACE CRACK HAD BEGUN TO \"RUN\" FROM ONE OF THE POCK MARKS DOWN THE WINDSHIELD - ABOUT 2 TO THREE INCHES IN LENGTH.   A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHEN WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR A RECALL FIX UNRELATED TO THE WINDSHIELD, WE WERE TOLD THE CRACK WAS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF THE ORIGINAL DINGS AND WAS THEREFORE NOT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.    I HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINCE THE LATE 1950S.  NEVER ON ANY CAR I HAVE OWNED HAVE I SEEN AN ENTIRE WINDSHIELD THREATENED BY WHAT BEGAN AS MINOR DAMAGE SUCH AS WAS SUSTAINED BY OUR ELANTRA.    TO DATE, THE CRACK HAS INCREASED DOWN THE WINDSHIELD TO ABOUT 8 INCHES, AND APPEARS HEADED FOR THE LOWER WINDSHIELD FRAME.
