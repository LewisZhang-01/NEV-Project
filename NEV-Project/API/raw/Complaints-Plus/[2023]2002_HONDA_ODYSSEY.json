When I was on the highway the car lost power and I was almost rear-ended by a car when I was stopped on the freeway on my way to the doctor. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? No, I am a recent buyer and do not have much information about previous problems with this vehicle. Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No, when it broke down, I just called the tow truck and they transported it to a mechanic and the mechanic put the machine in to find out what the fault was, and he told me and showed me that the fault was in the transmission and the cost would be $1800 to $2000 dollars or so to fix it. Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? Yes, before the breakdown the car turned on a light that I didn't recognize but I kept going because I was on the freeway and a few meters ahead the accelerator didn't respond, so I had to pull off the road to call the tow truck. Personal, I don't have any documents to prove this because logically I don't have $2000 dollars to fix the transmission. When I was with the mechanic and he checked the car he just showed me and said what it meant.   the light that came on the dashboard. Also, yesterday I received this paper and it said that if the car shows up with more faults to come in with the code that comes on the document. I found it strange to receive it because according to me when I bought the car, everything was in good condition and now the transmission is not working, apart from the air bag. For these reasons I would like to know how I can take the car to them, if it does not walk and to get it to them, I have to take the tow truck.",

Starting in 2019, three aftermarket fuel pump lock rings have failed on one 2002 Honda Odyssey. The lock rings were all made of plastic. The OEM Honda lock ring was also made of plastic and after 17 years did not fail, but was replaced when a new fuel pump was installed. A DELPHI model FG0956 fuel pump had two lock ring failures. The third lock ring failure was on a AIRTEX model E8642M fuel pump.  The torque spec per Honda for the fuel pump lock ring is a hefty 69 FT LBS or 93 NM. An SK click type torque wrench model 73100 was used on the installs, as was a fuel tank lock ring tool LISLE model 63000. All the lock rings were at first hand tightened to prevent cross threading before using the torque wrench. The SK torque wrench used has never been known to over torque bolts. The third lock ring for AIRTEX was torqued to about 60 FT LBS due to the prior failures.    No warning lights or messages appeared when the lock ring fails. All failed within one year of install. Failure detected by noticing the smell of gasoline, especially outside the vehicle and sometimes inside the vehicle.  Each of the failed lock rings split, and then gasoline starts leaking out of the top of the tank at the fuel pump and onto the ground. The fuel pump will start to rise above the tank due to it being spring loaded and the lock ring failing. The problem is most noticeable after filling the fuel tank, and when the vehicle is exposed to high outside air temperatures. If you look under the vehicle, a puddle of gasoline on the ground is sometimes visible just below the fuel pump. If the failure is not yet severe enough, you will not see a puddle but may still smell gasoline.   A local auto parts store recommended purchasing an OEM Honda lock ring due to the aftermarket failures and the hefty Honda torque spec of 69 FT LBS on a plastic ring.",

MANY OF THEM HAD A NEAR FATAL ACCIDENT DUE TO THE 2ND GEAR LOCKUP AT HIGH SPEEDS. THE JET KIT FAILED TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION ISSUE. IN ALMOST ALL CASES, HONDA USA REFUSES TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION FOR FREE. A HONDA DEALER WAS CHARGING $5600 FOR THE REPAIR, BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET A DISCOUNT OF $1800. THERE SHOULD BE A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST HONDA SINCE MORE THAN 1 MILLION CUSTOMERS WERE AFFECTED BY THIS TRANSMISSION SAFETY PROBLEM ON THE ODYSSEY AND HONDA PILOT.  HONDA SHOULD REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FOR FREE! I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT MY TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 73,241 SINCE I HAVE VERY LOW MILES.

THE RECALL SERVICE WORK WAS PERFORMED 4/21/2004 BY AN AUTHORIZED HONDA DEALER. HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE SHUTTERS WHEN CHANGING BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD GEAR AND WILL SOMETIMES HAVE A DELAYED SHIFT BETWEEN GEARS WHERE THE CAR SLOWS DOWN QUICKLY WHILE IN LIMBO. TWO SAFETY ISSUES ARE PRESENT. ONE, THE CAR SHUTTERS AND SEEMS AS THOUGH IT'S TRANSMISSION WILL CAUSE IT TO COME TO AN ABRUPT AND VIOLENT STOP SINCE IT'S MOVING AT AROUND 35 MILES AN HOUR. SECONDLY, IF CROSSING AN INTERSECTION AFTER STOPPING OR YIELDING TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, IF THE TRANSMISSION DISENGAGES OR GOES INTO LIMBO BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD, IT PRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING STRUCK BY ONCOMING VEHICLE. THE DEALER, BROWN'S HONDA OF GLEN BURNIE, MD, STATES THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IN IT'S ENTIRETY AS REPLACING COMPONENTS DOES NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM - IT IS AN INHERENT PROBLEM. I'VE VERIFIED THE DEALERS STATEMENT WITH OTHER PROFESSIONALS. WITH THIS SAID, I BELIEVE THAT HONDA'S REMEDY IS SHORT LIVED AND TO SERVE AS A BANDAID AND WOULD SINCERELY APPRECIATE AN INVESTIGATION BY THE NTSB. THANK YOU *TR",

HE PULLED OVER AT A \"PARKING\" RESTOP, NO FACILITIES, JUST AN \"AID\" PHONE (WHICH DIDN'T WORK).   THE ENTIRE VEHICLE FILLED UP WITH SMOKE AND WHEN WE OPENED THE HOOD, THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE WAS TREMENDOUS.  IT SMOKED FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES.  WE CALLED FOR SERVICE, BUT SINCE THAT'S A PRIVATE ROAD, WE COULDN'T GET A TOWING COMPANY TO COME OUT.

SINCE THAT AMOUNT IS TOO HIGH, WE HAD THE VEHICLE MOVED TO A RELATIVES HOME IN SCHNECTADY UNTIL WE CAN SOMEHOW GET IT BACK HOME. *TR",

ON 9/28/04 BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN AT 40,676 MILES WITH THE SAME HESITATION ISSUES.

I TOOK THAT AS GOSPEL AND DROVE WITH THE EVER WORSENING ISSUE UNTIL TODAY (9/5/09).  ON 9/2/09 I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR A TRANSMISSION FLUSH TO SEE IF THAT MIGHT HELP.  THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND THE TLC LIGHT WAS ON.  THE SERVICE PERSON AND MECHANICS DID NOT EVEN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE, EVEN THROUGH THEY WERE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AROUND THEIR LOT.  I MENTIONED THE LIGHTS TO THE SERVICE PERSON WHO TOLD ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AROUND FOR A FEW DAYS AND IF THE LIGHT STAYED ON TO COME BACK IN.  THEY WOULD TURN OFF THE LIGHT AND SEE IF IT SAID OFF.  IF IT CAME BACK ON I SHOULD BRING THE VAN BACK IN.  MY TRANSMISSION TOTALLY FAILED.  IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC MY VAN STARTED TO SLAM IN AND OUT OF GEAR.  I HAD TO SLAM ON BREAKS TO KEEP FROM SLIDING OUT OF CONTROL DUE TO THE SUDDEN LOWER GEAR KICKING IN AT 70 MPH.  LUCKILY I HAD JUST DROPPED OFF MY DAUGHTER AND IT WAS ONLY MY WIFE AND I IN THE VEHICLE.  I AM UPSET THAT I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOTALLY IGNORED THE LIGHTS THAT WERE ON, AND THAT THEY TOLD ME TO DRIVE AROUND WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WOULD GET WORSE.  I FOUND TWO BLOGS WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVING THESE SAME ISSUES - FAILING TRANSMISSIONS EVEN WHEN MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN MAINTAINED AND FAILING SERVICE AT HONDA DEALERSHIPS.

HONDA SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE '02-'03 ODYS, BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE \"RIGHT THING TO DO\". I UNDERSTAND THE TRANS PROBLEM WAS \"FIXED\" FOR THE NEW-BODY STYLE '04 ODYSSEY. SO BASICALLY THE '02-'03 ODY OWNERS ARE PRETTY MUCH ON THEIR OWN TO BATTLE WITH AM HONDA $$ TO GET A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION WHICH IS KNOWN TO HAVE \"HEAT BUILD-UP\" PROBLEMS AND FAIL. EVEN THE RECALL NOTICE STATES THERE IS A HEAT RELATED PROBLEM. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE TRANS FAILED AT 40K MI AND I PAID FOR IT!.

RECALL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED FOR MY VEHICLE BY REPLACEMENT OF THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION IN 2005. I HAD NOT NOTICED ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2006 THAT ALERTED ME TO ANY NEW PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION.    WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE AT 62 MPH.  SPOUSE AND FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WERE PASSENGERS. WITHOUT WARNING, A LOUD \"CLUNK\" WAS AUDIBLE FROM THE ENGINE AND THE VEHICLE LURCHED, AFTER WHICH THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY LOCKED, THE FRONT WHEELS QUIT TURNING, AND THE VEHICLE SKIDDED TO A STOP WITHIN AROUND 100 YARDS OR LESS FROM THE INITIAL POINT OF FAILURE. THE FRONT TIRES WERE SMOKING AND NEARLY BURNING WHEN THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST, HAVING BEEN WORN DOWN TO THE BELTS DESPITE THEM BEING ONLY ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT WHEN THE TRANSMISSION LOCKED, IT ALSO CAUSED THE ENGINE BLOCK TO CRACK, THE SHIFT CABLE SNAPPED, AND THE RIGHT AXLE WAS BROKEN INTO TWO PIECES. AMERICAN HONDA AGREED TO INSTALL A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION, A SALVAGE ENGINE, NEW RIGHT AND LEFT AXLE ASSEMBLIES, AND NEW FRONT TIRES. THE DEALER WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND THE TRANSMISSION BACK TO HONDA.    I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ONLY VERY LIMITED CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE FRONT WHEELS  LOCKED, AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THERE WAS NO CRASH, INJURIES, OR FATALITIES CONSIDERING THAT THIS OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IN A NARROW URBAN CONSTRUCTION ZONE WITH MODERATE TRAFFIC. AT LEAST TWO OTHER VEHICLES AVOIDED HITTING MINE FROM BEHIND ONLY BY QUICKLY BRAKING AND SWERVING INTO THE ADJACENT LANE.    THIS IS A WELL-KNOWN DEFECT FOR THIS TRANSMISSION THAT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED BY THE RECALL.

THE FOLLOWING MONDAY 4/7/08 TOOK VEHICLE TO PATTERSON'S AND SHOWED THEM THE DEPLOYED AIR BAG. JIMMY KENDRICK IN SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT. THEY CONNECTED THE COMPUTER TO THE SYSTEM AND IT INDICATED A SIDE IMPACT. JIMMY VISUALLY INSPECTED THE VEHICLE TO HAVE NOT HAD ANY \"SIDE IMPACT\" AND COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY IT HAD DEPLOYED. I ASKED IF HONDA WOULD CORRECT THE FAULTY AIR BAG SYSTEM AND WAS TOLD \"NO\".

WE ARE CURRENTLY AT A STANDSTILL.  WHO HAS $4,000 TO FIX SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE A PROBLEM? NOT ME.  *TR",

WE DID NOT USE AAA TO TOW THE VEHICLE SINCE WE WERE AT A SERVICE STATION AND THEY CALLED AROUND FOR US TO TRY AND GET A SOLUTION. A MINOR PROBLEM IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WHEN A DOOR SUDDENLY OPENS AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL OR AT THE VERY LEAST AN INVESTIGATION. PLEASE RESPOND SO WE KNOW SOMETHING IS BEING DONE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE AND BEFORE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING GETS SERIOUSLY INJURED. IF OUR DOG FELL OUT ONTO A BUSY INTERSTATE I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE CHAOS THAT WOULD ENSUE MUCH LESS THE HEARTACHE OF THE CHILDREN (THANK GOD FOR CHILDSEATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  *TR",

THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS WHERE I'VE HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE. THE SYMPTOMS WERE SIMILAR TO THE INFORMATION ON THE TRANSMISSION RECALL NOTICE I RECEIVED FROM HONDA A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO HONDA OF WESTPORT, WHERE THE SERVICE MANAGER (GEORGE) TOLD ME POINT BLANK THAT THE RECALL CAMPAIGN WAS OVER. AFTER SOME PERSUADING, THEY AGREED TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEM, AND SAID THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE IT. LAST WEEK, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. ON CALLING THE WESTPORT HONDA SERVICE DEALER, THE SERVICE MANAGER (GEORGE) TOLD ME THE SAME THING (I.E., THE RECALL CAMPAIGN IS OVER). FRUSTRATED, I TOOK MY CAR TO THE LOCAL MECHANIC WHO CHECKED THAT DIAGNOSTICS CAME BACK WITH CODE P703 (INCORRECT GEAR RATIO), INDICATING THAT IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. I CALLED BACK GEORGE AT HONDA OF WESTPORT WITH MY FINDINGS AND HE REPEATED THE SAME \"RECALL CAMPAIGN IS OVER\" AND I WOULD HAVE TO BEAR ALL EXPENSES TO REPAIR THIS VEHICLE. GIVEN THAT THE PROBLEM STARTED BACK IN MARCH, JUST PAST THE VEHICLE'S WARRANTY, I BELIEVE IT IS UNFAIR OF HONDA TO REBUFF ME AND REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ISSUE WHICH IS ALREADY WELL DOCUMENTED.  *TR",

IT HAS A VERY HARD SHIFT, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LURCH AND JOLT FROM GEAR TO GEAR.  THIS HAS MADE ACCELERATION DIFFICULT AND DECELERATION ALMOST AS BAD, BECAUSE THE VAN GOES FROM SLOWLY ACCELERATING TO AN UNEXPECTED JUMP IN SPEED WITH A NECK CRACKING LURCH.  WE HAVE TAKEN OUR VAN TO THE SHOP REPEATEDLY STARTING AT 6869 MILES, AGAIN AT 7867, COMPLAINED AT EVERY SERVICING, HAD THE TRANSMISSION RECALL WORK PERFORMED, CONTINUED COMPLAINING WITH NO RESULT.  WE GAVE UP FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS.  WHEN THE PROBLEM WORSENED WE SWITCHED MECHANICS IN 2004.  OUR NEW MECHANIC WORKED ON THE TRANSMISSION AND THROTTLE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE CODES IN THE VAN'S COMPUTER TO TRULY DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  ON 21 SEPTEMBER 2006, HE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A HONDA MECHANIC (WHO IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF HIS) TO LOOK AT THE VAN AGAIN.  THE HONDA MECHANIC SAID THAT HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW HONDA COULD TELL US NOTHING WAS WRONG FOR SO MANY YEARS - THE VAN COMPUTER WAS FULL OF CODES CONCERNING THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION IS A 2001 TRANSMISSION IN A 2002 VAN.  HE SAID THE TRANSMISSION IS PART OF A HONDA RECALLED GROUP OF TRANSMISSION FROM THE 1999-2001 MODEL YEARS.  THIS IS WHY THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY, WHY IT HAS SUCH A HARD SHIFT, WHY IT CANNOT ACCELERATE SMOOTHLY, WHY IT CANNOT DECELERATE SMOOTHLY, AND WHY IT DROPS OUT OF GEAR WHEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.   *NM",

THIS WAS NECESSARY TO PROPERLY ANCHOR OUR INFANT/TODDLER SAFETY SEAT. THREE DEALER EMPLOYEES TRIED TO PROPERLY TIGHTEN THE SAFETY SEAT, BUT DESPITE A METAL SAFETY-SEAT LOCKING CLIP ALSO BEING USED, THE SEAT BELT STILL LOOSENED UP WHEN THE INFANT/TODDLER SEAT WAS JIGGLED. THE DEALER EMPLOYEES GAVE UP CLAIMING THAT 1-INCH PLAY BETWEEN THE TODDLER SEAT AND THE VAN SEAT WAS LEGAL AND PROMISED THE BELT WOULD LOCK IN PLACE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT AND MY CHILD WOULD BE SAFE. ON THIS ASSURANCE, WE LEFT THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE VAN.  FOR OVER 3 YEARS I TIGHTENED THAT SEAT BELT ANCHORING THE SAFETY SEAT EVERY WEEK OR TWO. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP AT LEAST TWICE DURING THAT TIME WHEN THE VAN WAS IN FOR MAINTENANCE. THEY NEVER CHECKED IT OUT, ONLY TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY AS THE SEAT BELT WOULD WORK PROPERLY IF WE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT. THE TODDLER SEAT WAS RECENTLY REPLACED WITH A CHILD BOOSTER SEAT USING THE SEAT BELT STANDARD OVER THE SHOULDER.  ON JUNE 2, 2006, ON IMPACT WITH ANOTHER CAR, THAT SAME SHOULDER-BELT LOCKING DEVICE DID NOT ENGAGE.

SHE HIT THE FRONT SEAT FACE FIRST WITH HER BOOSTER SEAT NOW ON TOP OF HER AND WAS THEN THROWN BACK, INCURRING NUMEROUS INJURIES.

I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP OWNER AND FINALLY THE SERVICE DEPT. GOT INFORMATION ON A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM RECALL, AND PERFORMED THE SERVICE IN SEPT. 2005.   THE CANADIAN HONDA CAMPAIGN NUMBER IS K16; NHTSA BULLETIN NUMBER IS 04V176000.  THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT. TOLD ME REPLACEMENT OF A LUBRICANT PART FOR SECOND GEAR WAS NEEDED.  I NEVER SAW THE BULLETIN ITSELF UNTIL YESTERDAY WHEN I FOUND IT ONLINE.   NOW I KNOW THAT THE BULLETINS SUGGESTED REPLACING THE PART FOR VEHICLES WITH UNDER 24000 KM (15000 MILES) AND FOR VEHICLES WITH MORE KMS/MILES- OURS HAD OVER 60000 MILES -DOING AN INSPECTION TO SEE IF THERE WAS DISCOLORATION ON THE GEARS FROM OVERHEATING, AND IF SO, REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION.

THE TRANSMISSION WOULD COME OUT OF 2ND BUT NOT ENGAGE 3RD GEAR AND WOULD ACT AS IF IT WERE IN NEUTRAL.    ANOTHER MODE OF FAILURE WAS THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ABRUPTLY COME OUT OF 3RD GEAR DURING ACCELERATION.    FOR BOTH OF THESE FAILURES THE ENGINE WOULD NO LONGER BE UNDER LOAD, AND RPMS WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE.  THIS LOUD REVVING AND NO ACCELERATION STARTLES THE DRIVER.  BOTH OF THESE MODES OF FAILURE ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAPPEN DURING ACCELERATION.  WHEN IT HAPPENED, YOU WOULD TYPICALLY BE TRYING TO CROSS A HIGHWAY, OR MERGE ONTO THE INTERSTATE.  THE DRIVER WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN AN ACCIDENT SITUATION BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAFELY CROSS THE  HIGHWAY, OR MERGE WITH TRAFFIC.  ADDITIONALLY, A REAR END ACCIDENT WAS A POTENTIAL DANGER BECAUSE YOU WOULD SUDDENLY STOP ACCELERATING, CATCHING THE DRIVER BEHIND YOU OFF GUARD.  WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS IN NEUTRAL DURING THE FAILURE, YOU COULD NOT GET THE TRANSMISSION TO COME BACK INTO GEAR UNTIL THE VEHICLE HAD SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY.    ONCE THE VEHICLE FAILED TO SHIFT BUT THIS TIME SHOWED A FAULT LIGHT ON THE DASH. THE FAULT DECODED TO AN \"IMPROPER GEAR RATIO\" MESSAGE.

IN THESE FORUMS MANY DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF ENGINE FAILERE AND BRAKES IN SOME CASES. HONDA JUST PUT OUT A RECALL ON 1998-2000 FOR THE ENGINE IGNITION SWITCH SHORTING OUT CAUSING ENGINE FAILERE. I SUGGEST THEY INCREASE THAT RECALL TO 2002 POSSIBLY. ALSO I READ WHERE THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR IS GETTING WET AND SHORTING OUT CAUSING THE SAME THING IN SOME CARS. IN ONE CASE I READ THAT THE VACUMM HOSE TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER MAY BE BAD. PUMPING THE BRAKES CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. SO ANY CASE I THINK HONDA HAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH ENGINES STALLING WHILE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING.

WE BROUGHT THE MINIVAN TO THE DEALER IN FREMONT AND THE DEALER SAID THERE ARE TWO COMMON CAUSES (AFTER SPENDING $130 INVESTIGATION FEE): DEFECT IN THE SRS CONTROL MODULE THAT CONTROLS WHETHER THE AIRBAGS SHALL BE RELEASED IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT, OR LOW BATTERY OUTPUT. FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE DEALER WE HAVE THE BATTER REPLACED ($85). THE DEALER THEN RESET THE SRS INDICATOR. WITHIN A WEEK THE SRS INDICATION IS NOW ON AGAIN ALL THE TIME. WE BROUGHT THE MINIVAN BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY ASKED US TO HAVE THE SRS MODULE REPLACED FOR ADDITIONAL ~$500. HONDA PROVIDES LIFETIME WARRANTEE ON SAFETY BELT, BUT NOT THE SRS SYSTEM THAT CONTROLS THE AIRBAG. WE BOUGHT THIS MINIVAN BRAND NEW AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENT. WE HAVE 2 YOUNG CHILDREN SO SAFETY WAS OUR PRIMARY REASON TO BUY THE HONDAY ODYSSEY - WELL NOW IT SEEMS THE SRS/AIRBAG OF THIS MINIVAN IS REALLY TROUBLESOME. IT SEEMS THIS SRS MODULE PROBLEM IS COMMON FOR LATE HONDAY ACCORD AND ODYSSEY FROM THE USER GROUP DISCUSSION - WHILE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY FEATURE, HONDA REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE EXTENDED WARRANTEE AS THE CASE FOR SAFETY BELT.

THEY REPLIED WITH ON NEXT VISIT, THEY WILL GREASE THE BRAKE, THE SOUND WILL DISAPPEAR.  I DID BRING IT NEXT TIME FOR OIL CHANGE. SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THEY GREASED IT, BUT SOUND IS STILL THERE.    THIRD TIME, CALL HONDA CORPORATE, REP SAID THAT'S NORMAL.  ASK IF THERE'RE ANY KNOWN PROBLEM, REP SAID NO.  I ASK HIM TO CHECK, HE SAID HE'S SURE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CAR.  JUST HAVE THE DEALER REPLACE THE BRAKE & PAY FOR IT.    WENT ON INTERNET, FOUND MANY ODYSSEY OWNER HAVE SAME PROBLEM.    ALSO FOUND HONDA EVEN HAS A TSB OUT.    NUMBER OF FAILURES, TOO MANY TO MENTION, IT'S DAILY.    WHY DOESN'T DEALER NOR THE HONDA ADMIT THE PROBLEM!        HAVE NOT REPORT THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM TO NEITHER DEALER NOR HONDA.    THE SRS INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON ONE DAY, I TURN OFF ENGINE & TURN ENGINE BACK ON.  THE INDICATOR LIGHT WENT AWAY.    THIS REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER STRANGE THING HAPPENDED A FEW MONTHS BACK.  WHILE DRIVING ON FREEWAY.  ALL THE SUDDEN, A BUNCH OF INDICATOR LIGHTS CAME ON, CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH, THE LIGHTS WENT OFF A FEW SECONDS LATER.",

I ARRANGED TO HAVE MY VEHICLE \"REPAIRED\" AT MY DEALERSHIP OF PURCHASE IN 5/04 PER THE RECALL INSTRUCTIONS. THEY INSTALLED AN OIL JET KIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN HONDA WEBSITE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A PERMANENT FIX. ON THIS WEBSITE THEY ALSO CLAIMED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH THIS MEASURE. IN MID AUGUST I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING IN 2ND GEAR AND SEVERAL NEAR STALLS WHILE DRIVING. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY DEALER AT WHICH TIME THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED COMPLETEY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ENTIRELY. THIS WAS DONE AT NO COST TO ME AS IT WAS RELATED TO THE RECALL ACCORDING TO THE DEALER. MY VEHICLE WAS THEN RE-EQUIPPED WITH A REMANUFACTURED (NOT NEW) TRANSMISSION. I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE BY MAIL TO VOICE MY CONCERNS REGARDING MY TRANSMISSION. THEY SUBSEQUENTLY INSISTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS NOT RELATED TO THE RECENT RECALL HOWEVER I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE GIVEN THE FACT THE WHEN MY TRANSMISSION WAS INSPECTED AT THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME THAT THE 2ND GEAR HAD FAILED AND THAT THE RECALL IN QUESTION DID AFFECT THE 2ND GEAR. I REQUESTED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY TRANSMISSION WHICH THEY EVENTUALLY DID PROVIDE ME AFTER MUCH NEGOTIATIONS. IN ANY CASE, I FEEL THAT THE AMERICAN HONDA HAS NOT BEEN TRUTHFUL TO ITS CUSTOMERS REGARDING THEIR CLAIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO DOCUMENTED TRANSMISSION FAILURES RELATED TO THEIR RECALL.*AK",

FORTUNATELY (MIRACULOUSLY), SHE DID NOT SUSTAIN ANY INJURY (EXCEPT BEING A LITTLE SORE THE NEXT DAY).  THIS WOMAN IS NOT A LARGE WOMAN...SHE IS ONLY 4'10\" AND DOES NOT WEIGH ALL THAT MUCH.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL OR INSIDE THE VEHICLE THAT TELLS YOU NOT TO USE THIS HANDLE TO HELP YOURSELF INTO THE VAN.  IT APPEARS TO BE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE.  IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC ON THE OUTSIDE, AND EVIDENTLY (NOW THAT I CAN SEE WHERE IT BROKE) IT IS PLASTIC ALL THE WAY TO THE MOUNTING SCREWS.    I WANTED TO REPORT THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HAZARD, SO THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE EITHER IN THE DESIGN, OR IN THE WARNING SYSTEM.  THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A VERY SERIOUS INJURY (BROKEN HIP OR OTHER BONES, OR EVEN A HEAD INJURY).    MY HONDA DEALER SIMPLY ORDERED A NEW PART TO BE INSTALLED.  I CAN GUARANTEE THAT IF THERE WERE AN INJURY INVOLVED, THIS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LAWSUIT.    I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE TO LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SUBMIT THIS COMPLAINT.    CAROL TOPITZER  MILFORD, CT.  *AK",

MY BROTHER OWNS AN ODYSSEY AND THE DOOR HANDLE ALSO BROKE ON HIS STICKING SLIDING DOOR.  OUR VEHICLE WAS REPORTED TO LIA HONDA WHEN IT HAD 4,748 MILES ON IT.  THEY TOLD US TO LUBE THE DOORS CONTINUALLY.  IT DIDN'T HELP!  EVERY TIME WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE WORK WE REITERATED THE CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH THE STICKING DOOR.  THEY CONTINUED TO STATE IT IS A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH AND THEY WOULD NOT LIST IT AS A WARRANTY VISIT.  NOTHING THEY SUGGESTED WORKED, PARTICULARLY ON HOT SUMMER DAYS WHEN THE WEATHER STRIPPING BEHAVED LIKE GLUE.  THE AMERICAN HONDA PERSONNEL WE SPOKE TO ON AUGUST 18TH TOLD US THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THAT HONDA WOULD COVER IT EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS OFF WARRANTY BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO GET THE LIA HONDA DEALERSHIP TO RESOLVE THE STICKING PROBLEM AFTER NUMEROUS VISITS UNDER WARRANTY.   AS OF TODAY, AUGUST 20TH, KATHERINE MEYERS OF AMERICAN HONDA HAS TOTALLY CONTRADICTED WHAT THE OTHER HONDA REPRESENTATIVE TOLD US AND STATES THAT THE STICKING DOOR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BROKEN HANDLE AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  I TOLD HER THIS HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING SAFETY ISSUE AND SHE STATED THAT AMERICAN HONDA IS UNAWARE OF THAT.  I SEE FROM THE NHTSB WEB SITE THAT THE FOLLOWING PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS ARE PERTINENT TO THIS SITUATION:  768792, 8018462, 8021100, 10007658, 10015774, 10023137, & 10038220.*AK",

COINCIDENTALLY THE SECOND GEAR RECALL WAS RECEIVED ONE WEEK LATER.  WE BROUGHT OUR ODYSSEY IN FOR THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AND RECALL.  THEY PERFORMED THE RECALL WORK BUT SAID THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED.  THEY SAID THAT IF THERE WERE A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION, THE ENGINE LIGHT WOULD ILLUMINATE.  AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR 3,000 MORE MILES, THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING HAS OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES.  SOMETIMES IT IS NOT AS NOTICEABLE WITH THE ENGINE GETTING UP TO 3,500 TO 4,000 RPM, BUT A COUPLE TIMES IT HAS REACHED OVER 5,000 RPM WITH A HUGE JERK WHEN THE VEHICLE FINALLY SHIFTED.  WE FINALLY COULD NOT STAND THE \"DEFECT\" AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE.    THEIR FIRST RESPONSE WAS THE VEHICLE WE OUT OF WARRANTY.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION/NEGOTIATION THEY DECIDED TO FIX THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING THE EGR VALVE AND THE SHIFT SOLENOID.  THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO OPERATE APPROPRIATELY FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO HOME.  THE NEXT DAY, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING MY THREE DAUGHTERS TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND THE DASH BOARD LIGHTS CAME ON (D, TCS, AND MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHTS) WITH THE TRANSMISSION NOT ALLOWING THE VEHICLE TO COAST.  THE VEHICLE SLOWED DOWN VERY QUICKLY.  SHE TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED WITH THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT ON.  SHE DECIDED TO TURN AROUND AND DRIVE HOME (1 MILE).  THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT SEEM TO BE OPERATING APPROPRIATELY AS THE VEHICLE WAS NOT ACCELERATING AND IN ONE VIOLENT JERK THE VEHICLE MADE A LOUD SCREECHING SOUND.  MY FAMILY IS HOME SAFE, BUT WE DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING OUR $30,000 SUPPOSEDLY RELIABLE HONDA ODYSSEY.  WE HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND ARE WAITING FOR THEIR CAL.  ALTHOUGH, WE ARE HOPEFUL THEY WILL RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM UNDER WARRANTY, WE ARE MORE HOPEFULLY THAT A RECALL WILL BE MADE FOR ALL 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY TRANSMISSIONS AS OTHERS HAVE POSTED VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES.  *JB",

IN JULY I EXPERIENCED EPISODES WHERE AFTER APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE GAS PEDAL, THE RPMS WOULD GO UP BUT THERE WAS NO ACCELERATION. ITOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY WERE \"UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM\". OF COURSE THE PROBLEM CONTINUED PERIODICALLY WHEN WE DROVE THE CAR. YESTERDAY AFTER DRIVING THE CAR IT WAS PUT IN PARK .

AFTER LETTING THE CAR SET FOR 1 HOUR, TRYED AGAIN, WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF PARK AND COULD DRIVE IT BUT COULD NOT PUT IT BACK INTO PARK. I HAD TO LEAVE IT IN NEUTRAL WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON.

I WAS IN LONG BEACH AT THE INTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE AND MENTIONED IT TO A HONDA REPRESENTATIVE, WHO PASSED ME ALONG TO \"THE NATIONAL SERVICE MANAGER\", TO WHOM I ALSO TOLD MY STORY TOO. THEY WERE IN DENIAL, SAID THEY HAD NO OTHER COMPLAINTS, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. TO REMEDY THE SITUATION ON MY OWN, I PAID FOR AND INSTALLED AN EXHAUST FROM ANOTHER HONDA MODEL THAT EXITS THE BIKE LOWER. HAVE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM SINCE, BUT AM NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL. I HAVE LEARNED THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS ALSO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WHAT CAN WE DO?*AK",

WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WHEN IT HAPPENS --- THERE'S NO TIME TO TAKE A PICTURE.  I'VE CONSIDERED RUNNING A VIDEO CAMERA, BUT IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN.
