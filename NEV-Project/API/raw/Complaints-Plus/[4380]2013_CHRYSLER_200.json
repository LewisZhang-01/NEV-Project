As stated \"There are no warning lights, sounds, or visual cues to indicate any sort of problem.\" The engine just turns off and the gas pedal hits the floor not allowing acceleration. \"In addition to the engine stalling, the power steering and brake assist shuts down.\" \"It doesn\u2019t trigger any error codes for an OBD-II reader, meaning technicians won\u2019t be able to diagnose the problem Once the car is disabled, there are varying reports about being able to restart the engine. Some say the car will restart right away like nothing ever happened, while others say they've been left on the side of the road waiting for their ignition to respond.\" This has happened on a nearly weekly basis since purchasing, sometimes multiple times in the week. Absolutely NO warning signs, the engine just shuts off. It has randomly died at stop signs, red lights, in intersections and on the highway in high speed traffic. Once while my elder mother was driving to pick me up from the airport and other times while my significant other was in the car driving he's 5 yr old daughter home from school, the latest one this previous evening and he reported to me that 2 cars had to quickly veering around them at the last second. It was absolutely terrifying for him with his child in the car.  After multiple visits to mechanics for the issue 2 diagnostic tests with no codes and no code history, and a fuel pump replacement that did nothing and numerous roadside calls .One mechanic was kind enough to state the vehicle has recalls for stalling issues and gave screen shots from his end. I called the number on the recall notices for Chrysler directly and was rudely informed that there were not \"active\" recalls on the car and that the previous ones, N52 and N02 are void",

It was so fast that I couldn\u2019t catch every light that flashed. JD ByRyder replaced the alternator for me as my car was under warranty at that time. I\u2019ve also had electrical problems with power windows and charging components in my car. When my car did this yesterday my wheel locked and I wasn\u2019t able to steer or anything so it posed a safety risk of crashing. This is a repeated problem and it needs to be checked into as it could\u2019ve been very fatal should I had been on a highway going faster than 35mph. You can get the repair invoice from JD ByRyder in Owensboro under [XXX] 2013 Chrysler 200. Car is available for y\u2019all to check upon request if needed. Due to covid I don\u2019t have the money to have it repaired again. I also have grandchildren that are with me everytime I am in my car. This could\u2019ve been a serious fatal accident.

BUT SINCE IT'S AN EITHER-OR WARRANTY, I WAS NOW OUT OF A CAR THAT I HAD PAID ALMOST $30,000 FOR, UNLESS I WANTED TO GO IN HALF WITH CHRYSLER AND PAY THEM AN ADDITIONAL $2113.44 TO REPLACE OR FIX THE CURRENT TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION IS A CLOSED TRANSMISSION BUT DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY SERVICE UNTIL 96,000 MILES PER THE OWNER'S MANUAL.    HAD I HAD, MY THEN 9-MONTH-OLD GRANDSON WITH ME WHEN THE CAR WENT FROM 45 MPH TO NOTHING AND A VEHICLE HAD BEEN BEHIND ME, WE BOTH COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR EVEN KILLED.  THE CAR NEVER GAVE ANY WARNING THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE BEFORE THERE WAS AN ISSUE.  I FIND THIS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY AS A PARENT, NANA, AND QUITE FRANKLY A HUMAN.  HAD I KNOWN OF THIS WEBSITE WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT THEN!  HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO MAKE THIS KIND OF SITUATION NOT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE.",

DROVE IT OFF THE LOT FOR A TEST DRIVE. DROVE JUST FINE. GOT BACK TO THE DEALER. SIGNED A PAPER AND LEFT WITH IT FROM THE DEALER FOR THE NIGHT. WELL ON MY WAY HOME. I THOUGHT WOULD GO OUT OF MY WAY A LITTLE BIT FOR A LITTLE EXTRA DRIVE. (KEEP IN MIND I HAD A FULL TANK FROM THE DEALER) LOL! SOMETHING I REQUESTED. BECAUSE WHEN I TEST DROVE IT. IT WAS ON E. AND GAS LIGHT WAS ON. BUT BACK TO THE POINT. WHILE GOING OUT OF MY WAY. I STOPPED TO GET PIZZA. AND LEFT MY CAR RUNNING. ALL LIGHTS WERE ON. I'M SITTING INSIDE WAITING FOR MY PIZZA. SINCE I CALLED IT IN BEFORE HAND. GOT MY PIZZA. COME OUT TO MY CAR. AND I STOPPED IN MY TRACKS. AND THOUGHT. HMM. I COULD HAVE SWORE I LEFT MY CAR RUNNING. LIKE WTF. AND MY HEADLIGHTS AND EVERYTHING WAS STILL ON! AND THEN I THOUGHT. OH [XXX]... I GOT INTO MY CAR. EVERYTHING IS ON. AC (WHICH OF COURSE WASN'T COLD AIR SINCE ENGINE WASN'T RUNNING) AND ALL MY LIGHTS WERE ON. AND I KNEW AS SOON AS I GOT INTO MY CAR AND THE RPM'S ARE ON 0 AND EVERYTHING IS STILL ON. I SAT THERE FOR A MINUTE. IN SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT. TURNED MY KEY BACK. AND TURNED IT BACK AND IT FIRED RIGHT UP. SO I WAS UPSET BUT DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. CALLED MY DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. TOOK IT IN AND THEY GAVE ME A LOANER WHILE THEY \"FIXED\" IT. GOT IT BACK AND DIDN'T HAPPEN AFTER THAT. NOW IT JUST STARTED AGAIN TODAY. BOUT A MONTH WORTH'S OF TIME... I'M SICK OF THIS. MY CAR ONLY HAS 45K NOW. AND I GOT IT WITH 37K... TAKING MY CAR IN ONCE AGAIN. THIS IS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY...

I STOPPED THE CAR AND SHIFTED THROUGH PARK, NEUTRAL AND MANUAL IN AN ATTEMPT TO FREE UP THE TRANSMISSION BUT WHEN I STARTED DRIVING AGAIN IT STILL WOULD NOT TRANSITION OUT OF FIRST (1ST) GEAR EVEN WHEN PUT IN THE MANUAL SHIFT MODE. I DROVE IT DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE VEHICLE, AND AFTER A TEST DRIVE THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS NOT SHIFTING BUT STATED THEY COULD NOT FIND A CODE INDICATING ANY PROBLEM. THEY RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND IT BEGAN TO FUNCTION NORMALLY AGAIN.

I TOOK THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM EXISTED AT HIGH SPEEDS. I SET THE CRUISE CONTROL AND IT DIED TWO TIMES IN TEN MINUTES. THE CAR STARTED BACK UP WITH NO PROBLEMS. I CHECKED ON LINE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS ON MY 200. THERE IS AN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 13V043000 (FEB 06,2013) THAT IS CATEGORIZED AS FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE. THIS MAY BE THE ISSUE BUT THE CHRYSLER DEALER DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS A RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE. THIS RECALL IS FOR A GAS TANK THAT HAS A BROKEN CONTROL VALVE IN THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY. I THINK THAT MY PROBLEM WITH THE CAR COULD BE ONE THAT WAS DISCOVERED TWO YEARS AGO ON 2011 CHRYSLER 200 WITH 3.6L V6 ENGINES. MY CAR HAS SHUT OFF WHEN IDLING OR COMING TO A STOP WITHOUT A WARNING SIGN AND NO DASH INDICATOR LIGHT. I TURNED THE KEY TO OFF AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE. IT STARTED RIGHT AWAY AND I BELIEVE THAT IT LET ME START IT WHILE IT WAS STILL IN DRIVE. MY CAR HAS STALLED (4) TIMES IN THE LAST WEEK. THE NHTSA OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO STALLING PROBLEMS ON JUNE 22, 2012. IT COVERED AN ESTIMATED 87,288 VEHICLES. CHRYSLER ANNOUNCED THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) DEFECT IN THEIR 3.6L ENGINES. THE PCM WAS INITIATING A PURGE MONITOR CHECK WHILE THE ENGINE WAS AT IDLE OR SLOWING DOWN. THE PURGE RESULTED IN AN \"OVERLY RICH VAPOR CONDITION THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE TO STALL\". CHRYSLER DEVELOPED A SOFTWARE PATCH WHICH REPROGRAMS THE PCM. THE PATCH WAS RELEASED AS PART OF A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM\" IN SEPTEMBER 2012. THE NHTSA CLOSED THE INVESTIGATION AND DID NOT FORCE CHRYSLER TO ISSUE A RECALL BECAUSE CHRYSLER CLASSIFIED THE PROBLEM AS \"LOW RISK\".   *TR",
