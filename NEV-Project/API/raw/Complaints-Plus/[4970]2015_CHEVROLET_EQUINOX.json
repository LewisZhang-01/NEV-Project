I was confused because I had just had oil changed approximately 3-4 weeks prior to this incident.   I had the vehicle towed to a mechanic where it was inspected and concluded that the engine was damaged and the vehicle would need a new engine.  The mechanic indicated to me that there was a known issue with the Equinox 2.4L, 4 cylinder engines, where the engine burns excessive oil internally, leading to engine failure.  He had just had another equinox in his shop with the same issue.  The mechanic contacted Jasper motors, a company that rebuilds engines, they could get me a new engine, but not until mid-march because there were 40 of this engine on backorder.    I conducted an internet search to see how widespread the issue is.    Websites such as carbrain.com, chevroletproblems.com, motorreviewer.com, vehiclehistory.com, and wvdot.com, all say the same thing; the 2.4L engine \"burns excessive oil\".    I guess on one hand, you could say buyer beware, you have to know what you are purchasing, but on the other hand, the Chevrolet dealer that I purchased this vehicle from did no disclose to me that there was a know issue with these engines and I should continually check the oil levels.  Had that been disclosed, I would have likely purchased a different vehicle, or, at least had the necessary knowledge to prevent this from occurring.  If there is a know issue with this engine burning excessive oil, why hasn't it been recalled and fixed?",

I was driving on the interstate in the middle of a downpour.  Had to pull over several times on the way home because periodically it would move back up and get stuck.  When it wasn't stuck I had to lean to the right to see out of the right side of the windshield to get home.  For about 20 miles. My husband figured out the issue and purchased the malfunctioning part and repaired it.  In December 2021, my engine seized at a stoplight.  I coaxed the car out of the way and got it on the side of the road.  The only warning to this was an occasional \"ticking\" noise, that never seemed to happen when my husband listened to it.  We assumed it was the timing chain, but after having it towed to the dealer we were told it was an \"oil consumption\" issue. The \"oil life\" alert had been on for about a month, and I had planned on getting an oil change the weekend this happened.  However, little did I know that the vehicle had ZERO oil in it.  The low oil pressure light never came on.  As a matter of fact no warning lights ever came on.   The vehicle is now sitting at the dealership, unmoving because the fix is $8300.",

The windshield wipers came on for a few seconds and then stopped moving.  The wiper blades would not come back on after multiple attempts.  I could not see out my front window.  I was able to put on my hazards and pull quickly off onto the berm with my passenger guiding me.   I called the Chevrolet Dealer and they said they could replace the Windshield Wiper Transmission under a \"Special Policy\" at no cost to me.  Dealer explained Chevrolet knows there is a problem with the wiper transmission and the special policy extends warranty to replace for no charge to me.  Dealer said at this time Chevrolet is not recalling, just waiting until a car owners wipers fail and then they will replace. I had it replaced. The Dealer has replaced other Equinox wiper transmissions in my rural county, pop. 62,000. Chevrolet issued a recall for Windshield Wiper Transmission failure for the 2013 Chevrolet Equinox. Chevrolet and NHSTA are aware there is a problem with the Equinox for more than just the 2013 models, including the 2015 which I own.  To date no recall or advisory has been issued to me or other Equinox owners. I was fortunate to have a berm to pull over on, fortunate not to crash my car and injure myself, my child or any other vehicles.  Had I been further on my journey on the state route or county road to my home, with zero visibility, I would have had nowhere to pull over safely.",

I put my wipers from the regular steady setting up to high, and they instantly both went all the way to the left and turned off in the upright position. They would not respond again.   Middle lane, 65 mph, thunderstorm, and I can\u2019t see anything out my windshield and cars are flying beside me on both sides. I rolled my window down but couldn\u2019t see around my hood to the road and steer at the same time. I couldn\u2019t get to the right lane to pull over because of the traffic and even if I could it was dangerous to be on a narrow shoulder at that point in this rainstorm.    I put my flashers on, slowed to 40 and stayed in the middle lane as best I could based on the white lane markers as I still had zero visibility out my windshield. One I was past the last of the on ramps for that section I could pull over to the right lane at least and I got off at the next exit. Once I was on a city street to pull over, there was still so much traffic I had to wait until I could get out and put my wipers at least in the down position. They did not feel broken or slack at all. I waited a while for the rain to let up, but it would soon be dark, so I decided to slowly drive the rest of the way.  it took me a half hour to drive the length of Troy on side streets  slow enough so I had some measure of visibility in the still downpour.   I cannot believe the wipers stopped working at the high speed setting on a highway in the middle of a storm. I could have crashed my car easily. What if my children had been with me? A failure like this is unacceptable and incredibly dangerous.   It is a holiday weekend. I will call the dealership tomorrow in hopes they are open to speak to them about this.",

After getting the code we called our local mechanic and he told us the first thing we should do was check the oil level, as this is a common problem with 2015 Equinoxes. We had to add 2 quarts just to get the oil to even reach the dipstick. At no time did we ever receive an indicator about the oil being low, we just got the check engine light. Our mechanic said if we were lucky that an oil change might fix the issue. After leaving the shop, the Equinox kept stalling and the engine light came back on. We took it back in and he replaced both solenoids, which we thought had fixed the problem, but he informed us about this being a well-known issue.  We then had to take the Equinox to a GM dealership anyway to fix the windshield wiper transmission issue (which is a known issue that I only discovered after my wipers broke while I was driving on a busy highway in the rain) and we asked them to do a fuel consumption test. The diagnosis came back that the pistons and rings need to be replaced, which appears to be the same issue that the 2011-2013 Equinoxes/Terrains have. There are special coverages for the previous model years and there was also a class-action lawsuit, so I don't understand why I'm repeatedly being told by GM that it's not a common issue with 2015s.  As someone who works for a supplier to GM and who has friends and family members who work for GM, I'm not ignorant to how the automotive industry works. It's no secret that these engines get used across multiple model years, so it seems likely that this is the same 2.4L engine. Yet GM has repeatedly told me that even though I believe that this is a common issue, it actually is not.",

WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY TWO MECHANICS THAT OUR ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THEY SAID THAT MY ENGINE BURNS AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL WHICH IS WHAT CAUSED IT TO GO BAD. BOTH MECHANICS STATED THAT THEY HAD TO REPLACE THIS 2.4L ENGINE IN A MULTITUDE OF CHEVY EQUINOX'S AND GMC TERRAINS. ONE OF THE MECHANICS HAD BOTH A CHEVY EQUINOX AND A GMC TERRAIN AT ONE POINT AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH BOTH OF THEM. I RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND IT IS IN FACT VERY COMMON AND GM KNOWS ABOUT IT. I PERSONALLY HAD 20 PEOPLE REACH OUT TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY OR SOMEONE THEY KNEW HAD THE EXACT THING HAPPEN TO THEM. IF THIS IS SUCH A WIDE SPREAD ISSUE THEN GM NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR FAULTY ENGINES.  IT COSTS $6300 DO REPLACE AN ENGINE. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND JUST BECAUSE GM IS CHOOSING TO BRUSH THIS UNDER THE RUG.THIS IS A SAFETY RISK. MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT ONE POINT AND OUR CHEVY EQUINOX JUST SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE BECAUSE OF THIS ENGINE PROBLEM. HE COULD HAVE BEEN HIT AND KILLED. IS IT GOING TO TAKE THAT TO HAPPEN FOR GM TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOMETHING THEY KNOW VERY WELL IS A PROBLEM?",

MY HUSBAND PICKED ME UP FROM THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE I WAS NERVOUS AND SCARED. MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED UNTIL THE RAIN STOPPED 2.5 HOURS LATER BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DRIVABLE DUE TO THE HEAVY RAIN/STORM.

I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS SAFELY AS I COULD, WHILE TURNING THE WIPERS ON AND OFF WITH NO RESPONSE.  SINCE I WAS TRAVELING ALONE, I SAT AND COLLECTED MYSELF WHILE WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO SUBSIDE. WHEN I COULD I GOT OUT AND GAVE THE WIPERS A PUSH , HOPING THEY WERE \"STUCK\". THEY WENT DOWN AND STAYED .  WHILE THE RAIN HAD SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPED, I MADE MY WAY SLOWLY ABOUT 5 MILES  TO AN AUTO ZONE.  THERE THEY CHECKED MY FUSES AND RELAY SWITCHES WHICH CHECKED OUT FINE. I WAS 4 HOURS AWAY FROM HOME AND WITHIN A LARGE WEATHER FRONT. THE AUTO ZONE PEOPLE ADVISED ME TO \"RAINX\" MY WINDSHIELD , WHICH I DID.  I THEN DROVE 36 MILES TO THE NEAREST MOTEL IN WEST POINT MISS. I HAD TO STAY THE NIGHT AS THE WEATHER FRONT PASSED. AFTER WATCHING THE WEATHER RADAR, I LEFT WEST POINT MISS. AT 4:45 A.M. ON SATURDAY MORNING TO ATTEMPT TO MISS THE NEXT RAIN EVENT PREDICTED TO ARRIVE AROUND 9:30.  THANKFULLY I ARRIVED HOME AT 9;00 A.M. DURING SPRINKLING RAIIN. THE AUTO ZONE EMPLOYEES HAD TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2015 CHEVY EQUINOX AND UPON ARRIVING HOME , I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP. MY VIN # WAS NOT ONE THAT WAS IN THE RECALL. BUT UPON RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE, I FOUND MY PROBLEM IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND MANY 2015 EQUINOX OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION. AS ANY TIME THE WIPERS ARE NEEDED IN DRIVING, TO NOT BE ABLE TO RELY UPON THEM IS EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING AND DANGEROUS. I FEEL GM MOTORS IS TAKING THEIR CAR OWNERS SAFETY VERY LIGHTLY. SINCE I HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS VEHICLES SINCE 1972, AND THIS BEING THE FIRST GM PRODUCT I HAVE EVER OWNED. I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE TO TAKE GM'S LACK OF CONCERN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN PURCHASING MY NEXT VEHICLE.",

LESS THAN 3 MONTHS LATER, IN EARLY MARCH OF 2019, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY STARTED SMELLING OF GAS, RATTLING, STALLING.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE THE VEHICLE LESS A FEW MILES TO OUR LOCAL MECHANIC.  AFTER THE MECHANIC EXAMINED THE VEHICLE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ENGINE HAD FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH A FUEL PUMP AT A COST OF ABOUT $6300.  WE HAD PURCHASED A THIRD PARTY WARRANTY FROM PREFERRED WARRANTIES LLC THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP, SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE COVERED.  THE WARRANTY COMPANY REQUESTED A MORE THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE WHY THE ENGINE FAILED, AT A COST OF ABOUT $200, WHICH WOULD BE REIMBURSED TO US IF THE CLAIM WOULD BE APPROVED.  THEIR ADJUSTER VISITED OUR MECHANIC, AND DETERMINED THAT SINCE THE ENGINE HAD LITTLE OIL, ABOUT ONE PINT, THE DAMAGE WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEING 'RUN ON LOW OIL.'  WE WERE FLOORED, AS THE OIL HAD JUST BEEN CHANGED IN DECEMBER AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS NOT DUE FOR A CHANGE FOR ANOTHER 3K MILES.  WE HAD PUT ABOUT 1K MILES ON IT SINCE PURCHASE.    THERE WAS NEVER ANY INDICATION WHILE DRIVING THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM WITH OIL CONSUMPTION:  NO OIL LOW WARNING LIGHT, NO LEAKAGE UNDER THE VEHICLE, NO SMOKE, NO HESITATION IN DRIVING. WE DISCOVERED THAT CHEVY EQUINOXES WITH A 2.4L ENGINE BEGINNING IN 2010-2017 WERE EXPERIENCING EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION WITH MANY OF THE COMPLAINANTS STATING THERE WAS NO INDICATION THE VEHICLE WAS LOSING OIL.

THERE PROPOSAL WAS EITHER A $3500 FIX OR A NEW ENGINE FOR $7000. I CALLED GM MYSELF (COMPAINT REFERENCE #[XXX]) AND THEY STATED THAT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BUT THAT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE RECALL LIST TO HAVE IT FIXED. THEY INFORMED ME TO SAVE RECIEPTS UPON PAYMENT FOR ANY REPAIRS I HAD DONE INCASE LATER IN THE FUTURE THERE WAS A RECALL. I WAS ADVISED TO DISCUSS MY ISSUE WITH THE CUSTOMER EXPERIECE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR SOME RESOLUTION. UPON DISCUSSION WITH THEM THEY STATED THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AT THIS TIME AS THEY CAN ONLY FIX \"KNOWN\" ISSUE WITH PERMISSION FROM GM. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO ADVISED THAT IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO PAY $7000 TO HAVE ANOTHER ENGINE ADDED INTO MY VEHICLE AS THIS ENGINE WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. THEY ADVISED ME TO RENT A CAR UNTIL I COULD DECIDE WHAT TO DO. THE RENTAL CAR WAS $55/DAY EQUALING TO $1650 A MONTH WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. I HAD TO PICK UP MY CAR TODAY FROM THE DEALERSHIP AS I NEED TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM WORK AS I WORK 45MIN AWAY AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER OPTION AT THIS TIME. I WAS GIVEN A PAPER WITH DETAILS OF WORK NEEDED FROM DEALERSHIP THAT I WILL SAVE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. ON MY WAY HOME MY CAR STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES AGAIN. IT DOES INDEED TURN OVER AND RESTART ONCE DEAD, BUT THIS POSES A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD TO NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT OTHER DRIVERS ON THE STREET AS WELL. HOPE THERE IS SOME RESOLUTION TO THIS AS I HAVE READ MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ONLINE FROM OTHER DRIVERS WITH THE SAME CAR, SPECIFICALLY THE 2.4L ECOTECH ENGINE, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE.

I CHECKED IT AGAIN SAW IT WAS LOW, I LOOKED UNDERNEATH AND SAW OIL ON THE GROUND. I TOWED THE CAR TO MY REGULAR MECHANIC, HE SAID IT WAS A REAR MAIN SEAL. DURING THE REPAIR HE TOLD ME HE WAS RESEARCHING THE CAR AND LEARNED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR, AND WHILE HE IS REPLACING THE SEAL HE WANTED TO CLEAN THE  PCV SYSTEM  AS WELL. I ASKED HIM TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO REPAIR THE CAR. AFTER PAYING OVER $1000.00 MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT I MAY WANT TO CALL GM OR  NHTSA AND TRY TO GET REIMBURSED BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAME SYSTEM THAT WAS RECALLED, JUST A YEAR OFF. MY WIFE CALLED GM, THE PERSON SHE SPOKE WITH AGREED THAT THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE AND ASKED FOR ALL DOCUMENTATION, MY WIFE WAS SHOCKED WHEN THE 1ST REPRESENTATIVE TOLD HER THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THEN TOLD HER THAT A SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE WILL CALL HER BACK THE NEXT.  TODAY THAT SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE CALLED HER BACK. I WAS HOME WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AFTER SHE EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS DONE TO THE CAR THE FIST RESPONSE SHE GOT WAS \"SINCE WE DIDN'T TAKE THE CAR TO A GM DEALERSHIP THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO\" SHE THEN PUT ME ON THE PHONE AND I ASKED HIM THAT IF  THE GM DEALER FIXED IT  WOULD IT BE TAKEN CARE OF.?

THE MECHANIC STATED THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS ISSUE WITH THE CHEVY EQUINOX SEVERAL TIMES AND THAT CHANGING THE INTAKE/OUTTAKE VALVES GIVES A TEMPORARY RESOLVE; HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM TYPICALLY COMES DOWN TO THE ENGINE/MOTOR HAVING TO BE REPLACED, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY A $6000 REPAIR BILL, OR TAKE A COMPLETE LOSS ON THE CAR., BECAUSE METAL SHARDS AND OTHER THINGS GET TRAPPED IN THE ENGINE/MOTOR THAT CAN'T BE REMOVED. THEY DID REPLACE THE VALVES, WHICH COST ME $400+, TOLD ME TO KEEP DOING WHAT I DO, IN TERMS OF KEEPING MAINTENANCE UP, AND HOPE THAT SOMETHING IS DONE BEFORE THE ENGINE/MOTOR NEEDS REPLACING.
