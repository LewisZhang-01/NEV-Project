THE ARM REPLACEMENT WAS INTENDED TO RETURN THE TIRE CAMBER ANGLE TO ZERO (SEE ALIGNMENT CRITERIA IN LAST PAGE OF TSB) SO THE THE WHEEL WOULD BE PERPENDICULAR TO THE ROAD, AND NO LONGER CAUSE WEAR AT THE INSIDE EDGES.  AT A RECENT INSPECTION, THE TIRES WERE AGAIN FOUND TO BE WORN AT THE INSIDE EDGES: THERE WAS ABOUT 1/4 INCH OF TREAD ON THE OUTSIDE EDGE, BUT THE CORDS WERE SHOWING ON THE INSIDE EDGES.  I VALIDATED THAT THE DEALER HAD ACTUALLY INSTALLED NEW CONTROL ARMS (THEY ARE MARKED WITH A \"C\" AS DESCRIBED IN THE BULLETIN).  USING A LEVEL, I DETERMINED THAT THE TOP EDGE OF THE WHEEL WAS LEANING INWARD ABOUT 9/16\" INCH, SO IT IS APPARENT THAT THE REPLACEMENT ARMS DO NOT CORRECT THE CAMBER ANGLE PROBLEM.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE TIRE WEAR RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY THE REPLACEMENT ARMS.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE INSIDE EDGE WEAR IS NOT OBVIOUS WITHOUT CRAWLING UNDER THE CAR, THIS CONDITION COULD LEAD TO TIRE FAILURE.  I CORRECTED THE PROBLEM BY INSTALLING AFTERMARKET CONTROL ARMS THAT HAVE A LENGTH ADJUSTMENT, WHICH ALLOWS THE CORRECT CAMBER TO BE ACHIEVED DURING ALIGNMENT.

SINCE MY  CAR IN 2014 WAS SIX YEARS OLD, I THOUGHT THAT ALL WARRANTIES HAD EXPIRED LONG AGO AND SALVAGING THE CAR APPEARED TO BE A GOOD DEAL.  I GOT $10K AND HAD A MECHANICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY SOUND VEHICLE WITH LOW MILEAGE.  RESEARCH HAS SINCE SHOWN THAT HUNDREDS OF CIVIC OWNERS WERE NOT NOTIFIED AND HONDA ROUTINELY STRICTLY ENFORCES THE WARRANTY.  FOR FOUR YEARS HONDA WAS SELLING A DEFECTIVE CAR AND DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HIDE FROM THE PUBLIC.  MANY OWNERS RECOUNTED THE CAR JUST SHUTTING DOWN ON THEM.

HAD MY ENGINE SHUT DOWN SUDDENLY THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE SUBSEQUENT ACCIDENT.  THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.

I LEARNED THE NEXT DAY THAT THE CAR HAD SUFFERED A ENGINE COOLANT LEAK WHICH HAD THE MADE THE VEHICLE INOPERABLE.

THE CAR STARTED OVERHEATING.I TOOK IT TO THE HONDA DEALER ON NORTHERN BLVD, NY AND THEY SAID THE BLOCK ENGINE IS CRACKED AND I ASKED ABOUT THE 10 YEARS EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE NASTY SALES GUY I WAS TALKING TO WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE AND ASKED TO CHANGE DIFFERENT AGENT..AND I WAITED 15 MINUTES AND ANOTHER GUY CAME AND EXPLAINED THAT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY CAR EXPIRED 4 WEEKS AGO AND I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE AN ENGINE REPLACED BUT I STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LABOR 13 HOURS LABOR..AT TOTAL PRICE OF 1800$ ...  SINCE AND, HONESTLY, IF I HAD BEEN AWARE OF THIS ISSUE I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT OTHER VEHICLES...I'M SURE THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ABOUT THE ENGINE BLOCK CRACKING IN HONDA CIVIC 2008..THIS IS CRAZY ....I THOUGHT HONDA WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RELIABLE!",

FORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO PULL OVER THE CAR TO A SAFE PLACE IMMEDIATELY BESIDE THE HIGHWAY OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A FATAL SITUATION. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC  WHERE THEY PERFORMED THE DIAGNOSIS TO FIND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. THEY IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS CRACK IN THE ENGINE BLOCK WHICH HAS CAUSED THE COOLANT TO LEAK FROM THE ENGINE AND HENCE OVERHEATING OF THE ENGINE HAS HAPPENED AND MADE IT TO MALFUNCTION. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE WHOLE ENGINE HAS TO BE REPLACED (USED ONE) AND FEW OTHER PARTS AS WELL (LIKE SPARK PLUG ETC.) TO MAKE THE CAR RUNNING AGAIN WHICH WOULD COST ME AROUND $2500. IT WAS DEVASTATING TO HEAR THIS.    MY MECHANIC TOLD ME  THAT MOST OF THE 2006 TO 2009 CIVICS HAD THIS ENGINE CRACK ISSUE AND HONDA IS ALSO AWARE OF THIS. DESPITE THIS HONDA HAS NOT CALLED FOR THE RECALL OF SUCH THOSE ENGINES AND JUST DID A WARRANTY EXTENSION. TSB 10-048 WAS ISSUED FOR THIS.

PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS IN DEPTH BECAUSE THIS ISSUE HAS SATURATED THE WEB WITH COMPLAINTS AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

I WAS ON A HIGHWAY GOING ABOUT 70 MPH. (MY TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE ON MY DASH IS FAULTY SO I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT WHEN IT CAME ON SINCE I ROUTINELY CHECK MY TIRE PRESSURES.) ABOUT A MINUTE LATER I NOTICED THE ROAD NOISE SEEMED LOUDER THAN NORMAL. VERY QUICKLY I STARTED TO FEEL MY TIRE BECOMING FLAT AND MY CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN ON ITS OWN. AS A YOUNG WOMAN I FELT UNSAFE PULLING OVER ON A DARK ROAD IN THE RAIN, AND IN A LOCATION THAT I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH. I PULLED OFF THE NEXT EXIT AND DROVE VERY SLOWLY UNTIL I COULD PARK IN A WELL LIT GAS STATION. HOWEVER BY THIS TIME TIRE WAS TOTALLY SHREDDED. THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE TIME SPAN OF 3 MINUTES, THERE WAS LITTLE WARNING OR TIME TO REACT. WHEN I GOT MY SECOND FLAT I WAS DRIVING WHEN IT LOST AIR. THE THIRD FLAT OCCURRED WHEN IT WAS STATIONARY IN A PARKING LOT. I DROVE TO SCHOOL WITH NO PROBLEMS, AND ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER I FOUND THAT MY TIRE HAD LOST IT'S AIR. IN THE LASTTWO INSTANCES, MY TIRE BECAME FLAT WITH NO APPARENT CAUSE; NO NAILS, TEARS, OR GASHES. I HAVE THE ROAD HAZARD WARRANTY WHICH IS WHY I'VE STAYED WITH THIS BRAND, HOWEVER I AM CONSIDERING SWITCHING TO TIRES THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE RELIABLE. THE HEAT SHIELD IN THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL NOW MAKES A NOISE AND I BELIEVE IT WAS DAMAGED DUE TO THE TIRES UNRELIABILITY. EVEN WHEN THE TIRES WERE IN GOOD CONDITION, THE ROAD NOISE AT HIGHER SPEEDS WAS VERY LOUD AND I FOUND THEM TO HAVE POOR TRACTION IN RAIN AND WINTER CONDITIONS. IN THE RAIN, I HAVE TO DRIVE SLOWER THAN OTHER DRIVERS BECAUSE MY CAR WILL HYDROPLANE WHEN IT GOES OVER THE SMALLEST PUDDLE. IN THE WINTER, MY CAR WOULD FISH TAIL CONSTANTLY EVEN WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS BRAND OF TIRE AT ALL.",

THEY DID TAKE PICTURES TO HOLD FOR RECORD. I ESCALATED TO HONDA AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO GAVE ME FILE # 4452996 TO HAVE THE ISSUE REVIEWED. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. MANY PHONE CALLS DIRECTLY TO VOICEMAIL WITHOUT RESPONSE FOR DAYS. I WAS TOLD BY RON L. TO GO AHEAD AND SCHEDULE THE SERVICE WITH LOCAL DEALERSHIP. I SAID, \"DOES THIS MEAN THE PAINT JOB WILL BE COVERED, AND HE SAID EITHER PART OR ALL SHOULD BE COVERED. BEFORE I GET A CHANCE TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT, ANOTHER CS AGENT, TONY CALLED AND LEFT ME A MESSAGE STATING THAT I SHOULD CALL HIM RIGHT AWAY REGARDING MY FILE NUMBER. 2ND AGENT ALLED ME AND STATED THAT HIS FIELD REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE AT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND MAKE A DECISION.  I RECEIVE A CALL FROM TONY YESTERDAY TELLING ME THE CLAIM HAD BEEN DENIED. I ASKED HIM WHY AND HE TOLD ME HE HAD NO INFORMATION ON WHY IT WAS REJECTED AND TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER FOR MORE INFORMATION.

WHILE DRIVING WEST ON 44, THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG SUDDENLY DEPLOYED.  MY SON SAID HE HEARD A LOUD BANG AND HIS HEAD WAS PUSHED BACK INTO THE HEADREST.  WHEN THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED HE IMMEDIATELY SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AND ENDED OFF THE ROAD ON THE LEFT SIDE IN THE MEDIAN.  HE WAS SHOCKED AND OVER WHELMED THAT THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE HE DID NOT HIT ANYTHING.  A HELPFUL PERSON STOPPED AND HELPED REMOVE THE DEPLOYED AIRBAG.  SOON AFTERWARD, STATE POLICE ARRIVED AFTER ANOTHER MOTORIST CALLED AND CONFIRMED NO DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE CAR TO WARRANT DEPLOYMENT OF AN AIRBAG.  MY SON THEN CONTINUED ON TO JOPLIN.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, MY SON TOOK THE CAR TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP IN JOPLIN.  AFTER INSPECTION, THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THAT A SMALL HOLE IN THE FRONT FENDER CAUSE THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY...THEY FOUND GRASS AND DEBRIS FROM THE HIGHWAY MEDIAN AROUND THE DAMAGED AREA.  THEY WERE VERY UNCOOPERATIVE AND MORE WILLING TO BLAME THE CAUSE ON MY SON RATHER THAN A DEFECTIVE AIRBAG SYSTEM THAT IS KNOWN TO BE A PROBLEM IN SEVERAL OTHER MODELS.  INDEED, WHILE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAUSE AND LOOKING FOR OTHER REASONS.  MEANWHILE, WE ARE MORE CONCERNED AND LUCKY THAT MY SON DID NOT GET KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT!      WHAT ABOUT OTHER SONS, DAUGHTERS AND LOVED ONES DRIVING THESE TIME BOMBS...ARE THEY GOING TO BE THIS LUCKY?    THE CAR SUFFERED NO COLLISION AND YET THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED WHICH IS THE FACT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP IS IGNORING.   I AM MORE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF THE AIRBAG SYSTEMS.

SHE AGAIN SAID NO AND IF THE PAINT IS CRACKING THEN ITS SOMETHING I'M DOING WRONG IN TAKING CARE OF THE VEHICLE. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY CONFIRMED THE ISSUE AND STATED THAT HONDA IS NOT BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THE ISSUE AND MY CAR WAS THE 3RD ONE THIS WEEK BROUGHT IN WITH THE SAME FAILING PAINT.

THE CIVIC WAS TAKEN TO OTHER SERVICE PLACES AND THEY AGREED THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR LOCKS AND ELECTRICAL.  IN ADDITION, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE CV AXLES TWICE ON THIS CIVIC.  THE FIRST WAS DONE UNDER WARRANT AT APPROXIMATELY 38,000 MILES.  I HAVE SINCE HAD TO CONTACT AMERICAN HONDA A SECOND TIME, AND BECAUSE AGAIN THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY I WAS REQUIRED TO PAY $400.00 TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR.  THIS WAS NOT A FAIR COMPROMISE SINCE THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES.  THE THIRD PROBLEM CONCERNS THE WHEELS BEARINGS.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT LEFT WHEEL WAS REPLACED SHORTLY AFTER THE AXLES WERE REPLACED.  I NOW AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT LEFT WHEEL BEARING GOING BAD.  I SPOKE WITH A MASTER MECHANIC, AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY THE TECH AT SOUTHPOINT HONDA IN DURHAM HAVING OVER TORQUED THE BOLT TO SECURE THE WHEEL BEARING.

A FEW DAYS LATER WE SMELLED THE GAS AGAIN, SO I WENT TO HONDA AND PURCHASED A NEW GAS CAP ABOUT $25.00 AND CHANGED OUT THE OLD FOR THE NEW. THE NEXT MORNING WE SMELLED GAS AGAIN, SO I CALLED HONDA AND THEY SAID GET YOUR CAR IN HERE ASAP. WE TOOK THE CAR IN AND LEFT IT, A FEW HOURS LATER WE RECEIVED A CALL TELLING US THAT THE FILL PILE WELD WAS LEAKING AT THE TANK. THE SERVICE MAN ALSO SAID THE GAS TANKS WERE ON BACK ORDER, BUT HE WOULD TRY TO FIND ONE ELSEWHERE. HE HAD NO IDEA WHY THE WELD FAILED AND ALSO WHY THE TANKS WERE ON BACK ORDER. THE SERVICE MAN CALLED A FEW HOURS LATER AND FOUND A TANK IT WAS BEING SHIPPED EXPRESS AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE HERE THIS WEEK. THE ESTIMATED COST IS $971.00 FOR THIS REPAIR AND PARTS.  I DID SOME CHECKING ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT IN 2007 THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF GAS TANKS AND THE SAME PROBLEM WAS OCCURRING.

(STEERING GEARBOX MOUNTING BOLTS NOT TORQUED CORRECTLY).  I CALLED HONDA'S CUST. SER. #.    SHE INFORMED ME I COULD TAKE IT TO MY HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY WOULD   INSPECT IT FOR ME FOR 75.00  I ASKED HER SINCE THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN THEY HAD SENT OUT TO GARAGES, WHY I HAD TO PAY A FEE?  SHE SAID THAT WAS PROTOCOL.  I ASKED THAT IF IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS ON THE SERVICE BULLETIN IF I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.  SHE WOULD NOT SAY YES, ONLY SAYING, \"POSSIBLY.\"  I DECIDED NOT TO GO THAT ROUTE. MY FRIEND'S HUSBAND TOLD ME TO BRING MY CAR IN AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE MOUNTING BOLTS TO SEE IF THEY WERE TORQUED CORRECTLY (FOR FREE).  THIS WAS THE SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUE, AND SOUNDED LIKE THE PROBLEM I WAS HAVING.  HE INSPECTED IT AND SAID THEY WERE TORQUED CORRECTLY, BUT IT IS STILL MAKING THE NOISE A YEAR LATER.  IT IS USUALLY WHEN I TURN SHARPLY LEFT OR RIGHT.  MY CONCERN I EXPRESSED TO MY FRIEND'S HUSBAND WHO LOOKED AT MY CAR WAS THAT I DIDN'T WANT THE PROBLEM TO BE TEARING SOMETHING ELSE UP, AND I DIDN'T WANT SOMETHING TO FALL OUT AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE ROAD, OR FOR MY STEERING MECHANISM TO FAIL AS I WAS DRIVING.  HE ASSURED ME ALL OF THIS WAS OK, BUT I STILL WONDER??  SHOULDN'T HONDA REPAIR ISSUES FREE OF CHARGE, THAT THEY PUT ON SERVICE BULLETINS?  THIS IS A DEFECT IN HONDA'S MANUFACTURING, NOT THROUGH ANYTHING I HAVE DONE.  I FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD INSPECT MY VEHICLE FREE OF CHARGE AND IF THIS SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUE IS THE PROBLEM, THEN THEY SHOULD REPAIR IT FREE OF CHARGE AS WELL.

THIS LACK OF ACTION BY HONDA FOR THIS COMMON FAULT IN THEIR IMA SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE. WHEN THE CAR WAS NEW AND THE IMA SYSTEM WORKED, I RECEIVED THE MPG AS PROMISED AND THEN SOME.

WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALER TO FIX IT, UNFORTUNATELY THEY CAN'T BE FIXED FOR FREE BECAUSE THE VISOR WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED ONLY TILL 100K MILES AND I AM ALREADY AT 132K+ MILES. HONDA SHOULD REPLACE THE VISORS REGARDLESS OF THE MILEAGE BECAUSE IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND NOT THE USER'S FAULT. DOES THE EXTENDED WARRANTY OF JUST 100K MILES MEAN THAT HONDA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN FAULT AFTER THAT LIMIT?    I WOULD APPEAL HONDA TO FIX THE SUN VISORS FOR ME FOR FREE.

I NOTICED A FEW MONTHS BACK THAT THE HYBRID BATTERIES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ACTING RIGHT AND WHEN I MENTIONED IT DURING MY 30,000 SERVICE THEY SAID THAT IT WAS TESTING OK AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.  OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS IT HAS STEADILY GOTTEN WORSE - TO THE POINT WHERE THE HYBRID BATTERIES WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE.  WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY STATED THAT WHILE THEY COULD SEE THAT THE BATTERY WAS DEAD IT WASN'T GIVING THEM THE \"ERROR MESSAGE\" OR \"ERROR CODE\" THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SO THAT THEY COULD REPLACE THE BATTERY.   THEY HAD TO KEEP IT AND DRIVE IT AROUND TOWN THE ENTIRE DAY AND PERFORM TESTS ON IT TO MAKE THE CAR FINALLY GIVE THEM THE ERROR CODE NECESSARY TO INDICATE THAT THE HYBRID BATTERY WAS NOT WORKING SO IT COULD BE REPLACED.  WHILE THESE BATTERIES ARE UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY ARE REPLACING THEM - I DON'T FEEL THAT 4 YEAR LIFESPAN FOR THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT IS ADEQUATE - PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT I DON'T DRIVE THE CAR A LOT.  ADDITIONALLY THIS IS A QUITE COSTLY PART - $4,000 IF IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE ERROR MESSAGE WAS NOT DISPLAYING DESPITE THE MONTHS OF ISSUES WITH IT - AND THE FACT THAT THE EQUIPMENT ONLY HAS A SHELF LIFE OF 4 YEARS IN MY LOCATION DUE TO THE CLIMATE.  THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED DURING MY PURCHASE AND HAD IT BEEN I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED A HYBRID VEHICLE.  THIS WITH THE FUEL TANK DEFECT HAS ME SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING THIS CAR MAKER'S QUALITY AND DURABILITY OF THEIR VEHICLES. *TR",

I THEN REALIZED THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE DOOR WAS NOT LOCKING & TOOK IT IN TO NORM REEVE WHERE THEY STATED THE MOTOR WAS OUT &  THEY FIXED IT. I THEN ASKED IF MAYBE IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELECTRICAL & IF THEY COULD CHECK THE ELECTRICAL WIRING ON THE CAR, I WAS TOLD BY OCTAVIO, SERVICE MANAGER AT NORM REEVES, IT WAS NOT THE ELECTRICAL THAT IT WAS THE DOOR LOCKS. I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER, OCTAVIO AT THIS TIME I FELT LIKE THE CAR ALSO GIVES A PUSH OR SKIP WHILE DRIVING & ALSO SMELLED A BURNING SMELL. OCTAVIO STATED THE HONDA WAS CHECKED BY A TECH & SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT. I BEGAN TAKING THE HONDA CIVIC IN TO NORM REEVES EVERY MONTH COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CAR SKIPPING OR LOSING TRACTION. IT WAS FRIGHTENING DRIVING DOWN HILLS THINKING MY CAR WOULD NOT STOP OR LOSE CONTROL. THE BURNING SMELL WOULD BECOME GREATER WHEN DRIVING UP AN INCLINE OR THE HILLS OF ANY FREEWAY OR CITY. WHEN THE CAR WOULD BE PARKED AT AN INCLINE THE SHIFTER WOULD LOCK & BECOME HARD TO REMOVE FROM PARK. DURING EACH VISIT TO NORMA REEVES HONDA, WHICH OCCURRED MORE THAN 10 TIMES, I WAS NEVER TOLD OF ANY RECALLS OR EXAMINATIONS NEEDED IN REGARDS TO THE FUEL TANK PROBLEMS & ONLY FOUND OUT WHEN MY HONDA CIVIC WAS TAKEN TO ROCK HONDA OF FONTANA, CA.  *TR",

I HAVE GIVEN UP TAKING IT IN EVERY MONTH AND NOW JUST TAKE IT IN FOR ITS ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, I GIVE THEM A PRINTOUT OF MY CONCERNS AND THE TECH ATTACHES IT TO THE WORKORDER.    A)  LOW FUEL MILEAGE, AVERAGES 25 TO 28 MPG.  BEFORE IMA UPDATE, WAS AVERAGING 35 TO 45 MPG.  B)  SLOW ACCELERATION FROM STOPS, THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW IF THE VEHICLE IS GOING         TO MOVE OR NOT.  WE MUST LEAVE OURSELVES ALOT OF SPACE WHEN TRYING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF        THIS.  C)  IDLES ROUGH, OFF & ON, WHILE STOPPED OR PARKED, THIS IS USING UP GAS BECAUSE THE IMA BATTERY DOES NOT        COME ON AS MUCH AS IT USED TO.  D)  ASSIST IS NOT COMING ON AS MUCH AS IT USED TO, IF AT ALL.  E)  IMA BATTERY READING GOES FROM 1-2 BARS UPTO 8 OR SO IN MINUTES AND THEN BACK DOWN TO 1-2 BARS       WITHIN A MINUTE OR LESS.  USUALLY READS ABOUT 1-2 BARS MOST OF TIME.  IMA IS CHARGING ITSELF ON       FLAT GROUND, UP HILLS, DOWN HILLS AND WHEN BRAKING.

IN ADDITION, AS I TRIED TO INCREASE MY SPEED, THE CAR MADE A LOUD HUMMING SOUND AND THE RPMS ON THE DASH BEGAN TO INCREASE.

LATER, AFTER A DISCUSSION WITH THE HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE, I FOUND OUT A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED IN AUGUST 2010 FOR A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE BLOCKS OF 2006, 2008, AND SOME 2009 CIVICS.  THE HONDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO CIVIC OWNERS.  HOWEVER, MY EXPERIENCE TODAY SHOWED ME THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROBLEM.  I COULD HAVE A LIFE-THREATENING ACCIDENT TODAY, AND WHEN THE ISSUE IS SO GRAVE HONDA SHOULD CALL CAR OWNERS TO ALERT THEM TO THE RECALL.  A LETTER SENT OUT ONE TIME IS NOT ENOUGH.

THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT EXTREME UNEVEN TIRE WEAR ON THE INTERNET.  *TR",

THE SHUTTERING STOPPED AFTER THE CAR WAS IN HIGHER GEARS.  THIS VIBRATION ISSUE WORSENED AND WE COULD NOT SAFELY ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE WHEN SHIFTING FROM AN IDLE POSITION INTO 1ST GEAR - DUE TO EXTREME VIBRATIONS, WHICH BECAME MORE FREQUENT.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AROUND 35000 MILES ON NOVEMBER 17, 2010, TO DETERMINE/CORRECT THE SHUTTERING/VIBRATION ISSUES.  THE DEALERSHIP INDICATED THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE.  THE SHUTTERING/VIBRATION CONTINUED AND WE DECIDED TO REPLACE ALL OF OUR TIRES AT OUR COST AROUND 40,000 MILES TO SEE IF THIS WOULD CORRECT THE ISSUE.  THE VIBRATION/SHUTTERING CONTINUED AT VARIABLE TIMES.  AT 41,000 MILES, THE VIBRATION/SHUTTERING BECAME IMPACTFUL AND WE COULD NOT SAFELY ACCELERATE FROM AN IDLE POSITION WITHOUT THE CAR SHAKING/NOT ENGAGING EFFECTIVELY.  WE TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011 AND THE TECHNICIAN REPLICATED THE ISSUE WITH US IN THE CAR.  THEY INDICATED THEY LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE MOTOR MOUNTS AND \"LOOKED\" AT THE CLUTCH (NOT INSPECTED).  THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT AND IT WAS DUE TO THE WAY WE DROVE THE VEHICLE, EVEN THOUGH THEIR TECHNICIAN REPLICATED THE ISSUE.  THEY SAID HONDA DOES NOT HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS ISSUE VIA THE PHONE TECHNICAL LINE.  WE DID NOT TAKE THE CAR BACK DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS AND IT IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP.  WE DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE, AS IT WILL NOT ENGAGE/ACCELERATE PROPERLY WITHOUT SHUTTERING WHEN SHIFTING FROM IDLE INTO 1ST AND 2ND GEAR.  *TR",

MY WIFE, WHILE GOING ONTO THE FREEWAY WAS ALMOST HIT, WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE. MY WIFE IS NOW HATES DRIVING THE CAR SHE USED TO LOVE. WE LIVE IN A HILLY AREA.

THE BATTERY RARELY KICKS IN SO THAT DEFEATS THE HYBRID THEORY AND JUST ADDS MORE POLLUTION THAT HONDA PURPORTS THAT IT DOESN'T. TO PUT IT STRAIGHT, THIS IS NOT THE CAR I BOUGHT AND HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. I'VE BROUGHT MY CAR BACK TO HONDA TO TRY TO GET THE SOFTWARE ISSUE RESOLVED. THEY STATED THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, ENGINE OR BATTERY THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE. WHEN ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION FOR THE LOSS OF POWER AND MPG, THEY SAID THAT I SHOULD TRY A HIGHER OCTANE OF GAS OR A DIFFERENT BRAND. I HAVE ALWAYS USED THE HIGHEST OCTANE GAS FROM DIFFERENT GAS STATIONS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES BEFORE THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE. SO THAT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE REFUSED TO SAY THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THEIR \"SOFTWARE UPGRADE\". I HAVE PRETTY MUCH WASTED $26,000+ ON PURCHASING THIS CAR. ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS IS SHAME ON ANOTHER BIG COMPANY, TRYING TO SAVE $$ BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OWN LOYAL CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU HONDA! *TR",

WHITE PLAINS HONDA ADVISED MY SON THAT HE NEEDED FRONT BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS.  MY MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT BRAKES SHOULD LAST AT LEAST 30,000 MILES.  ON THE SAME DAY, MY MECHANIC REPLACED 1 SET OF FRONT DISC BRAKES AND 2 BRAKE ROTORS.    ON MARCH 26, 2010, MY SON'S CAR AGAIN NEEDED BRAKE REPAIR.  AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, THERE WERE 31,425 MILES ON THE CAR WHICH MEANT HE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL 14,202 MILES ON THE CAR SINCE HIS LAST REPAIR.

WHEN THERE WAS AN OPENING IN TRAFFIC I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR AND THE CAR MOVED OUT INTO THE TRAFFIC LANES, BUT WITH GREATLY REDUCED ACCELERATION.  MY HYBRID HAD LOST THE ELECTRIC MOTOR ASSIST NEEDED TO ACCELERATE NORMALLY.  I WAS ALMOST BROADSIDED BY A SPEEDING SUV BECAUSE I COULD NOT ACCELERATE OUT OF THE WAY QUICKLY.  2. THIS LOSS OF ELECTRIC MOTOR ASSIST OR INTEGRATED MOTOR ASSIST (IMA) STARTED OFF HAPPENING ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH.  NOW IT IS HAPPENING A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK.  THERE IS NO AUDIBLE OR VISUAL WARNING LIGHT THAT THIS LOSS HAS OCCURRED.  THE ONLY EVIDENCE IS THE LOSS OF ACCELERATION AND THE BATTERY CHARGE LEVEL WILL DROP FROM \"NORMAL\" (6 OR 7 BARS) TO ONE OR TWO \"BARS\" ON THE BATTERY CHARGE DISPLAY.  THIS UNEXPECTED LOSS OF NORMAL ACCELERATION CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS WHEN MERGING INTO BUSY TRAFFIC.  IT IS ONLY AFTER THE DRIVER COMMITS THAT THEY DISCOVER THEY CANNOT ACCELERATE \"NORMALLY\"  3.  I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP FIVE TIMES AND OPENED A CASE AT AMERICAN HONDA.  THEIR POSITION IS THAT SINCE THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE FAILURE, THEY CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.  AFTER DOING MY OWN RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS LOSS OF ACCELERATION IS DUE TO A PROGRAMMED FUNCTION IN THEIR IMA SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PERIODICALLY RESET THE STATE OF CHARGE FOR THE BATTERY PACK TO A MINIMAL VALUE TO ELIMINATE ACCUMULATED ERRORS.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE ELECTRIC MOTOR ASSIST IS DISABLED AND THE SYSTEM USES THE ELECTRIC MOTOR TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY PACK.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS \"RESET\" OCCURS AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME; WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND THE DRIVER NEEDS THE HIGH TORQUE/LOW RPM ELECTRIC MOTOR TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ACCELERATION.  IN MY OPINION, THIS UNANNOUNCED RESET FUNCTION AT A STOP IS A DESIGN FLAW AND MAKES THIS VEHICLE DANGEROUS TO OPERATE. *TR",

HONDA SAID THERE IS NO TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THEIR SUSPENSION AND THEY COULDN'T HELP ME. SO I HAVE A CAR WITH TIRES THAT ARE WORN OUT AT 15K MILES AND I HAVE NO RECOURSE BUT TO EAT IT AND HOPE THAT THE NEXT SET OF TIRES WEARS BETTER. THIS IS UNSAFE IN  MY OPINION.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WHERE PURCHASED AND WHO SAID THE TIRES IN QUESTION WERE WORN AND HAD FLAT PLACES PROBABLY DUE TO SKIDDING (THIS CAR HAS NEVER BEEN 'SKIDDED') AND THAT IF I HAD ISSUES WITH THE TIRES I SHOULD GO TO BRIDGESTONE (THE OEM FOR EL400). I WENT TO FIRESTONE (BRIDGESTONE DEALER) AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CAR CAUSING THE PROBLEMS. I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND GETTING NOWHERE CONVINCED THEM TO CHECK ALIGNMENT AND SUSPENSION. THEY DID AND FOUND THE REAR TIRE ALIGNMENT OFF. THEY ALIGNED THE REAR TIRES (THE FRONT TIRE ALIGNMENT HAD NO ISSUES) AND SENT ME ON MY WAY WITH NO OBLIGATION TO REPLACE THE WORN/DEFECTIVE TIRES. I REPLACED THE TIRES AT MY OWN EXPENSE TO AVOID POTENTIAL HAZARD OF KEEPING THE CAR ON THE ROAD AND FEARFUL FOR SAFETY OF MYSELF, MY FAMILY, AND OTHERS.  NEW CAR ' NEW TIRES IN 9 MONTHS ' THIS AIN'T RIGHT. I WAS SHOCKED AT THE FACT THAT THE OEM TIRES HAD NO MILEAGE WARRANTY AND WERE ONLY WARRANTED BY THE TIRE MANUFACTURER FOR DEFECTS. I WAS ALSO CONCERNED WHY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER AT THE TIME OF SALE. I HAVE GRAVE CONCERN THAT SOME FOLKS WHO CANNOT AFFORD NEW TIRES AFTER 9 MONTHS OR SOONER WILL CONTINUE TO USE AND DRIVE THEIR CAR IN THIS UNSAFE CONDITION.

ABOUT 3 WEEKS IN, I SUFFERED EXCRUCIATING NECK/SHOULDERS/BACK PAIN. I ADJUSTED THE SEAT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND MOVED THE HEADREST UP AND DOWN, TO NO AVAIL. FINALLY, I RIPPED THE HEADREST COMPLETELY OUT AND THEN I DROVE PAIN FREE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. NOW, THE PAIN IS BACK, EVEN THOUGH THE HEADREST IS STILL FACING BACKWARD. I HAVE CONTACTED MY DEALERSHIP BUT HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET ABOUT A SOLUTION. I'M STILL IN SEVERE NECK PAIN, AND I CURRENTLY HAVE NO WHIPLASH PROTECTION, SHOULD I CRASH, BECAUSE THE HEAD REST IS TILTED TOO FAR BACK. THE FORWARD-JUTTING HEADRESTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A WHIPLASH SAFETY FEATURE, BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF I REMOVE IT BECAUSE I CAN'T TOLERATE THE PAIN I'M IN EVERY DAY? THERE IS A TON OF INTERNET CHATTER OUT THERE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. *TR",
