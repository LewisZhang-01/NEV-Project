THE DEALER SENT THE MOTORCYCLE TO THE HEADQUARTERS IN ANOTHER CITY, STILL UNABLE TO KEEP THE BIKE FROM POURING OIL OUT AT HIGH SPEEDS. THIS IS GETTING OIL ON THE REAR TIRE, REAR WHEEL AND REAR BRAKE.  IT HAS SINCE BEEN DISCOVERED THAT THE DEALER THAT SOLD THE MOTORCYCLE WAS NOT AN AUTHORIZED LOCATION, NOR WAS THEIR MECHANIC. BUT THEIR MAIN STORE IS AUTHORIZED. I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ASK FOR LEGAL HELP.  BIG DOG HAS IGNORED MY PLEAS FOR HELP, AS HAS V TWIN CITY, THE DEALER. *JB",
