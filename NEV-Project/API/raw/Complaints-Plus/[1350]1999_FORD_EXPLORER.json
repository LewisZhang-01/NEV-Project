MY COMPLAINT IS, 4 MONTHS AGO I PAID $900 FOR THEM TO FIX WHAT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THEIR PRODUCT, THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM IS HAPPENING AGAIN AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF ME, OR WORM THEIR WAY OUT OF FIXING WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID THEM TO FIX. THE TECHNICIAN SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE AN INTERNAL LEAK, THE TORQUE CONVERTER, THEN SUGGESTED I MIGHT WANT TO REPLACE THE TRANNY.

IF IT IS LOCKED, AND IT NORMALLY IS BECAUSE IT LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY WHEN START TO DRIVE, NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET ME OUT.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE LOOKED IT UP ONLINE AND HAVE FOUND THAT QUITE A FEW PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  TO MAKE THINGS WORSE MY BACK DOOR HAS DONE THE SAME THING EXCEPT I CAN NOT GET IT TO OPEN AT ALL.  I HAVE TWO VERY YOUNG KIDS AND I WOULD HATE FOR THEM TO GET TRAPPED INSIDE.  I CAN'T OPEN IT FROM THE INSIDE BECAUSE THE CHILD SAFETY LOCK IS ON.  ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE I AM HAVING IS BEING SCARED THAT I WILL BE ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE WHEN UNLOCKING THE DRIVERS SIDE AND MAYBE  HAVING SOMEONE ELSE GET INTO THE CAR BEFORE I CAN GET IN AND LEAVE.

WHEN LOCKED, THE DOOR WOULD NOT UNLOCK.  THE POWER LOCK CYLINDER WAS ACTUATING, BUT NOT DISENGAGING THE LOCK.  THE DOOR COULD NOT BE UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY FROM THE OUTSIDE NOR THE FOB/KEY CHAIN.  ALSO, THE REAL CONCERN - THE DOOR COULD NOT BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE BY PULLING THE DOOR HANDLE (WHICH NORMALLY WOULD UNLOCK AND OPEN THE DOOR).  IN EACH OF THE THREE DOORS, A SMALL RETRACTING SPRING INSIDE THE DOOR LATCH WAS BROKEN.  HAD THE VEHICLE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT OR SOME OTHER SITUATION REQUIRING AN EMERGENCY EXIT FROM THE VEHICLE, THE OCCUPANT SITTING BY THE AFFECTED DOOR POSSIBLY COULD NOT EXIT THE VEHICLE WITHOUT MOVING TO ANOTHER DOOR OF THE VEHICLE.     3)  I REPAIRED THESE LATCHES MYSELF, USING SPRINGS PURCHASED FROM A LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, AS THE LATCHES ARE NOT AVAILABLE AFTERMARKET IN STORES SUCH AS AUTO ZONE OR NAPA (FORD DEALER MAY HAVE THEM BUT HAVE NOT CHECKED).

IT IS CURRENTLY IN FOR THE SAME REPAIR AGAIN.  I HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION IN THE PAST AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY HELP.  PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS IN WRITING AND LET ME KNOW MY OPTIONS. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.  I THEN CALLED THEN AND THEN EMAILED THEM THIS FOLLOW UP:I CALLED THE NUMBER YOU REQUESTED AND SPOKE WITH JASON AND AM DISSATISFIED WITH ANSWER HE GAVE ME.  HE DID SAY HE WOULD REPORT MY CASE TO THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT AS I BELIEVE THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR DRIVER'S SEATS ARE NOT PROPERLY DESIGNED AND ARE UNSAFE. MY EXPERIENCE WITH THEM IS THAT THE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM BENDS AND THEN THE FRAME FRACTURES AND THEN THE SEAT CAN POSSIBLE SNAP OFF. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF THIS OCCURS WHILE DRIVING. I AM A REGISTERED STRUCTURAL ENGINEER BY PROFESSION SO I UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THIS ISSUE. YOUR ENGINEERS SHOULD CHECK THEIR CALCULATIONS AND/OR CHECK THE METALLURGY OF THE SEAT COMPONENTS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR A PROPERLY DESIGNED SEAT TO BREAK LIKE MINE HAS.

I MANAGED TO HOLD DOWN THE BRAKE AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL STOP, ALL THE WHILE THE ENGINE WAS REVVING AT ABOUT 4,000 RPMS.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED THE CAR OVER AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.  I THOUGHT THAT THE FLOOR MAT MUST HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT ON THE GAS PEDAL AND I REMOVED THE FLOOR MAT COMPLETELY.  UPON MY RESTARTING THE ENGINE, IT IMMEDIATELY REVVED UP TO 4,000 RPMS AGAIN.  THANKFULLY THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE PARKED POSITION.  I QUICKLY TURNED OFF THE ENGINE BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS DANGEROUS TO TRY TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE.    I PHONED AAA AUTO CLUB AND HAD THEM SEND A WRECKER TO TOW THE VEHICLE.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, EDDIE YAKLIN IN KINGSVILLE, TEXAS.

HE CAME TO LOOK AT IT, HE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD & MENTIONED THAT FORD WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH CONNECTORS IN FRONT OF THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR & THAT SOME VEHICLES HAD EVEN CAUGHT ON FIRE! HE SAID IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD ALREADY MELTED. VERY CONCERNED, I MADE AN APPT FOR THE NEXT DAY.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MOORE MOTOR SALES IN CARO, & HAD THE RECALL DONE. ON MY WAY HOME, I TRIED OUT THE CRUISE CONTROL - TO MY SURPRISE, IT DID NOT WORK! WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD TO FIND THE PART THAT I THOUGHT WAS TO BE REPLACED WAS STILL THERE! SO, I CALLED MOORE MOTOR SALES AND SPOKE TO HEATH PETERS.  I QUESTIONED HIM WHY THIS MELTED PART WAS NOT REPLACED AND HE SAID THAT THE ONLY THING ON THE RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE WAS THE CABLE, NOT THE SWITCH. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I WAS CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MYSELF AT 8 MONTHS PREGNANT AS PASSENGERS. HE IMMEDIATELY SCHEDULED ME FOR ANOTHER APPT ON 08/15/05(MONDAY).  OVER THE WEEKEND I TOOK THE TIME TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE FURTHER. I DISCOVERED THIS \"SPEED CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH, \" HAD BEEN RECALLED IN SOME FORD VEHICLES, UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OTHERS & MY VEHICLE HAS THE SAME SWITCH AS THOSE UNDER THE RECALL. ON MONDAY, I WENT TO MY APPT AS SCHEDULED.  I INFORMED HEATH THAT I WANTED TO BE THERE WHEN THEY LOOKED AT MY SUV. I SHOWED HIM & THE SERVICE TECH THE CHARRED SWITCH.  THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THIS PART HAD MELTED.  I WAS INFORMED HOWEVER THAT SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT ON THE RECALL AS OF YET, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE COSTS TO FIX IT UP FRONT, WITH HOPES OF EVENTUALLY BEING REIMBURSED. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER FURTHER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE SAME PART JUST IN A DIFFERENT VEHICLE.  AND I HAVE PROOF THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY A DEFECTIVE PART NO MATTER WHAT VEHICLE THEY DECIDE TO PUT IT IN. I THANK GOD THAT NOTHING MORE HAPPEN IN MY CASE.  I'M SURE OTHERS WON'T BE SO LUCKY.   *NM",

ON BELOW DATE, MY WIFE EXITED THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND USED THE HANDLE TO MOVE THE SEAT FORWARD SO OUR DAUGHTER COULD EXIT THE REAR SEAT AREA.  THE HANDLE FELL APART IN TWO PIECES AND THE BACK PART OF THE SEAT FLEW FORWARD TO THE DASH.  THE BACK PART OF THE SEAT WILL NOT HOLD A POSITION AND FREELY MOVES BACK AND FORTH INTO THE REAR SEAT AND FORWARD TO THE DASH RENDERING THE SEAT UNSAFE AND USELESS.  ON 2/6/04, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SOUTH BAY FORD, 13900 HAWTHORNE BLVD, HAWTHORNE, CA 90250  PH 310 644-0211 FOR THE RECALL WORK.  I ALSO ADVISED THEM THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT HAD COME FREE BECAUSE OF A FAULTY RELEASE HANDLE.  I WAS CALLED LATER AND ADVISED IT WOULD COST OVER 400 DOLLARS TO REPAIR THE FAULTY RELEASE HANDLES ON BOTH THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS SEATS.  THE SERVICEMAN INFORMED ME THE DRIVERS SEAT RELEASE MECHANISM WAS ALSO ABOUT TO FAIL.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FORD DEFINITLY HAS A SAFETY ISSUE HERE INVOLVING THEIR SEATS IN THIS VEHICLE.  FORD HAS ALREADY ADDRESSED ONE SAFETY ISSURE INVOLVING THE RECLINING SEATS WITH THE RECALL INVOLVING THE FAULTY BOLT.

THE AUTOMOBILE STARTED TO SLOW DOWN AND WHEN MY HUSBAND ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE THE GAS PEDAL, THE AUTOMOBILE JUST STOPPED.  THE CAR WAS THEN PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAS TOWED TO EXPRESS AUTO SERVICE ON 18 FEBRUARY 2003 DUE TO THE SNOW CONDITIONS.   EXPRESS AUTO SERVICE CHECKED THE TRANSMISSION FOR PROPER OPERATION AND IT WAS DETERMINED AFTER A SECOND VISIT TO EXPRESS AUTO THAT THE 'TRANSFER CASE\" NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD NOT DRIVE THE AUTOMOBILE UNLESS THIS GETS REPAIRED BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MADE THE CAR DRIVE!  THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AFTER WE ENGAGED THE 4WD FROM LOW TO HIGH DUE TO DRIVING IN THE SNOW.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THIS AUTOMOBILE BEING FAIRLY NEW AND PURCHASE FROM PURVIS FORD IN FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA.  A NEW TRANSFER CASE WOULD HAVE COSTS APPROXIMATELY $2100.00. DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS WE RECEIVED A USED TRANSFER CASE FOR APPROXIMATELY $1439.00.

ACCORDING TO FORD, THIS WILL ALSO CAUSE THE HORN AND CRUISE CONTROL TO MALFUNCTION.  FORD WANTS $300 TO REPLACE THE CLOCK SPRING.  MY CONTENTION IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY DEVICE IN WHICH THERE ARE NO WEARABLE PARTS.  IT IS A MIS-ENGINEERED COMPONENT THAT SHOULD REQUIRE A RECALL TO FIX.  THIS COULD VERY WELL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEONE BY NOT DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  THERE ARE 30/40 COMPLAINTS JUST IN THIS WEB SITE ALONE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.

FAILING TO KEEP ONE FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND MAINTAINING AT LEAST 500RPM WILL CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. THE GEARING ARRANGEMENT OF MY EXPLORER CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL AT SPEEDS BELOW 30MPH WITHOUT USING BOTH BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR WHEN SLOWING DOWN OR COMING TO A STOP.

FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO STILL CONTROL THE STEERING AFTER LOSS OF THE POWER-STEERING AS A RESULT OF THE STALLED ENGINE. I ASKED MY DEALER IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN DEFECT OF THIS COMPONENT OR WAS FORD GETTING PARTS FROM A BAD SUPPLIER. ESPECIALLY, SINCE MY VEHICLE NOW HAS THE THIRD SUCH UNIT INSTALLED.

OF COURSE FORD BLAMED THE TIRES WHICH THEY REPLACED WITH MICHELIN'S. I STILL HAVE THE SAME SHAKING AND VIBRATION PROBLEMS I HAD WITH THE FIRESTONE TIRES. FORD SAID THAT THE EXPLORER'S RIDE THAT WAY AND TRIED TO TELL ME THAT WHAT I WAS FEELING WAS \"NORMAL\". TO ME, THIS IS A TOTAL LACK OF SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME OR ANY OTHER PERSON THAT PURCHASES THEIR PRODUCT. WHAT IF MY TIRES HAD BLOWN OUT ON THE HIGHWAY BEFORE THEY WERE REPLACED AFTER COMPLAINING TO THEM FOR MONTHS? THEY PUT MY LIFE IN JEOPARDY. ON TOP OF THAT, I HAD MY OIL CHANGED THE OTHER DAY AND FOUND THAT THEY NEVER REPLACED THE SPARE, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A RECALLED TIRE, SO I CAN ASSUME THAT THE OTHER 4 WERE RECALLED ALSO. IT WAS REPLACED BY THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGE. I HONESTLY DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE EVEN WITH DIFFERENT TIRES BECAUSE IT STILL SHAKES AND VIBRATES PRETTY BAD AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND I JUST HAD THE TIRES ROTATED, BALANCED AND ALIGNED. I HONESTLY FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MECHANICALLY WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. I ALSO FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE WON WITH THE LEMON LAW, AND THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR HAVING JEOPARDIZED MY LIFE FOR MONTHS BEFORE THEY CHANGED OUT THE TIRES AND ALSO BECAUSE IT STILL HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS. OF COURSE, ALL THE NEWS ABOUT THE RECALLED TIRES CAME AFTER I HAD COMPLETED THE LEMON LAW ACTION AGAINST FORD. I FEEL THAT FORD WAS GROSSLY NEGLIGENT WITH REGARDS TO MY PERSONAL SAFETY AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING DONE ON THAT LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED.

WHEN I HEARD THE TIRE BLOW I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND ALLOWED THE VEHICLE TO COAST TO ABOUT 30 MPH.  THEN I PROCEEDED TO USE THE BRAKES AND CHANGE LANES TO THE RIGHT SO I COULD GET ONTO THE SHOULDER AND PUT THE SPARE TIRE ON THE VEHICLE.  I AM SUPRISED I DIDN'T DAMAGE THE RIM BY DRIVING ON IT.  FORTUNATLEY NO ONE WAS INJURED AND NO ACCIDENT RESULTED FROM THIS INCIDENT.  THE NEXT MORNING I DROVE BY A FIRESTONE DEALER TO COMPLAIN BUT THEY WERE CLOSED SO I WENT TO BOB TURNER'S FORD COUNTRY AND HAD THEM REPLACE ALL THE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE.  WHEN I CALLED FIRESTONE ON TUESDAY THE 17TH, I WAS TOLD THAT I EITHER HAD A FLAT TIRE OR A LOW TIRE AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE BLOW OUT.  I KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I CHECK THE AIR PRESSURE IN MY TIRES EVERY SUNDAY BECAUSE I TRAVEL APPROXIMATELY 40 MILES A DAY ON THE FREEWAY.  AND THE TIRE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF A PUNCTURE WOUND.  THE TIRE BLEW OUT ON THE SIDEWALL AND THERE IS NO DAMGE TO ANY PART OF THE TREAD AREA OR SURFACE AREA THAT WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE ROAD.  IT IS JUST MY OPINION, BUT I BELIEVE THIS WAS A TOTAL TIRE FAILURE AND THAT FIRESTONE SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COST OF REPLACING THE TIRES.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE TIRES ARE NOT CURRENTLY ON THE RECALL LIST, BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTIGATION AND RECALLED BEFORE MORE PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED.  ALSO, IN AN EARLIER PART OF THIS FORM YOU ASKED FOR THE DOT CODE.  IT IS VERY HARD TO READ ON THE TIRE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT I ENTERED IS CORRECT.

ITS BEEN TO THE DEALER ON 4 OCCASIONS AND THEY CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, THEY ARE NOW CALLING IN THE FORD ENGINEERS TO TRY AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  WE HAVE ALSO HAD A SUSPENSION SQUEEK WHICH OCCURS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING NORMALLY AND ALSO ON  BUMPY ROADS.THE CAR HAS BEEN IN 4 TIMES AS WELL AND THE DEALERS HAVE JUST LUBED THE SUSPENSION, THE SQUEEK IS BACK AFTER A DAY OR SO, THE DEALERS ALSO CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, AND FIND SOME LOVELY EXCUSES AS TO WHY THERE IS A SQUEEK IE AFTER MARKET RUNNING BOARDS.  THE  FRONT BRAKES HAD A VIBRATION AND THE DEALER FOUND THE ROTORS OUT OF ROUND AND SKIMMED THEM. WHEN I QUERIED WHY THEY DID NOT REPLACE THE ROTORS, I WAS INFORMED IT WAS NORMAL FOR ROTORS TO GO OUT OF ROUND,THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED ON ANY OF MY OTHER CARS SO I FIND THIS A POOR EXCUSE. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL WITH THIS CAR AND I FEEL THE DEALERS HAVE HAD ENOUGH ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE CAR,AND  ITS TIME FOR FORD TO TAKE THIS CAR BACK AND GIVE ME A NEW ONE,OR REFUND ME MY MONEY SO THAT I CAN GO AND PURCHASE SOMETHING ELSE.I BOUGHT A NEW CAR SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BRAKE DOWNS ECT AND BECAUSE NEW CARS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SAFER.

THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SHOTTY THING TO HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT I PAID $23,000.00 FOR A TRUCK THAT WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD.  THE OTHER THING THAT DISTURBS ME IS THAT NO ONE AT THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THE FORD EXPLORER WAS TOP HEAVY AND THAT THEY TRIED TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS SHORTCOMING BY REDUCING THE AIR PRESSURE LEVEL TO 26 PSI.  A FIRESTONE REPRESENTITIVE INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRE BEING A CLASS \"B\" TIRE WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS PRESSURE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  ALL OF THIS SEEMS VERY DISTURBING TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE 4 OTHER RECALLS AND WARRANTY WORK THAT I AM HAVING DONE ON THE ROCKER ARM COMPONENT.  THIS IS MY FIRST FORD PRODUCT AND FIRESTONE PRODUCT.  I AM NOT IMPRESSED THUS FAR AND I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT I BE REIMBURSED FOR AT LEAST THE TIRE WORK I HAVE HAD DONE.  AFTERALL IT APPEARS THAT MY FAMILY AND I ARE TAKING ALL OF THE SAFETY RISKS WHILE USING YOUR PRODUCTS AND PAYING FORD/FIRESTONE BY WAY OF PAYING OUR LOAN.

THIS CAR WAS PURCHASED IN 1995 AND HAD 2 TIRES DELAMINATE ON TWO SEPERATE OCCASIONS.  ON BOTH OCCASIONS I WAS TRAVELLING ON I-15 AT ABOUT 70 TO 75 MPH, BOTH WERE ON HOT DAYS.  ONE WAS A RIGHT REAR TIRE, THE OTHER WAS A LEFT FRONT TIRE.  I HAVE HAD PREVIOUS TROUBLES WITH FIRESTONE TIRES SHREADING ON A 1989 BRONCO II.  THE BRONCO II INCIDENT WAS TAKEN TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER.  THE EXPLOYER INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE FORD DEALER.  I HAVE REPEATEDLY REQUESTED OF THE FORD DEALER THAT I GET TIRES OTHER THAN FIRESTONE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD, BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE REFUSED TO STAND BEHIND THERE WARRANTIES.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WOULD COST ME SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE.  WHEN I REPORTED THE DELAMINATIONS TO THE FORD DEALER, I WAS TOLD THAT THESE TIRES WERE DESIGNED FOR MAXIMUM MILEAGE WITH MINIMUM WEAR.  THIS, I WAS TOLD, REQUIRED USE OF HARDER RUBBER, WHICH WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO BOND TO THE REST OF THE TIRE.  THEY SAID THAT THE REASON THE TIRE DELAMINATED IS THAT IS WAS A SUPERIOR WEARING TIRE AND THAT I SHOULD BE PLEASED THAT I GOT 50000 MILES OUR OF THEM.  I, OF COURSE, STRONGLY DISAGREED, AND FEEL THAT A TIRE THAT DELAMINATES WITH NO OUTWARD SIGNS OF WEAR IS EXTRA DANGEROUS.  I NOW HAVE ANOTHER EXPLOYER, THE ONE IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT, THAT HAS FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES.  I ALSO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WORKS WITH ME THAT HAS AN EXPLORER THAT HAS HAD 2 TIRES DELAMINATE.  NOW THAT I FIND HOW WIDE SPREAD THIS PROBLEM IS AND HOW LONG THEY'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN TO REPLACE THESE TIRES.

THE VEHICLE WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE. DUE TO HEAVY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND LOSS OF CONTROL I HAD TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A HALT ON THE INSIDE HOV LANE. I DID NOT HIT ANY DEBRIS ON THE ROAD AND IT WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE THAT THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE HAD BLOWN OUT. THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WERE SO HAZARDOUS THAT IT TOOK AN ATLANTA, FULTON COUNTY POLICE OFFICER WITH SIREN, FLASHING LIGHTS AND HORN TO MOVE MY VEHICLE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY TO GET US CLEAR OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A GOODYEAR DEALERSHIP AND THE MANAGER CONFIRMED THAT THE TIRE HAD BLOWN OUT FROM THE INSIDE. I TOOK THE TIRE TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER AND THE MANAGER INSISTED THAT WE HAD HIT SOMETHING IN THE ROAD. I MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE HAD NOT HIT ANYTHING IN THE ROAD AND THAT I WOULD TAKE THE MATTER UP WITH THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND MY ATTORNEY. WITH THAT STATEMENT THE MANAGER AGREED TO REPLACE THE TIRE FREE OF CHARGE. I BECAME SUSPICIOUS WITH THAT QUICK TURN AROUND AND CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ISSUES WITH FIRESTONE TIRES. I AM INCENSED THAT FIRESTONE AND FORD KNOWINGLY JEOPARDIZED MY FAMILY BY REPLACING THIS DEFECTIVE TIRE WITH ANOTHER FIRESTONE WILDERNESS TIRE.

SINCE IT WAS A SATURDAY THAT THIS HAPPENED THE TRUCK SAT TILL MONDAY WHEN THE DEALER HAD IT TOWED BACK (I DID NOTICE TRANSMISSION FLUID ON THE GROUND).THE DEALER SAID THIS PROBLEM WAS DUE TO A CONNECTOR ON THE TRANSMISSION FLUID LINE NOT BEING SEALED OR TIGHTENED. I ASKED IF THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION WHICH THEY SAID IT WOULDN'T BE BUT THIS LEADS ME TO MY NEXT PROBLEM. THE TRUCK DOES NOT ACCELERATE THROUGH THE GEARS PROPERLY BUT FORD SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH AFTER LOOKING AT IT AGAIN. NEXT IT WAS IN FOR THE SPEED CONTROL CABLE WHICH THEY SENT A LETTER TO ME FOR BUT DID NOT HAVE THE CABLE IN STOCK AND WERE SUPPOSE TO DISABLE THE SPEED CONTROL UNTIL ONE CAME IN. THEY DID NOT DISABLE IT WHICH WAS VERY HAZARDOUS SAFETY WISE. NEXT THE TRUCK HAS BEEN IN BECAUSE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS WAS BLOWN AND IN FACT AFTER GETTING THAT ONE REPLACED THE OTHERS SOUND JUST AS BAD AS THE BLOWN ONE AND THE RADIO HAS NEVER BEEN TURNED PAST HALFWAY. MY LATEST PROBLEM IS THAT MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS WILL COME ON SPORACTICALLY AT ANY TIME AND STAY ON FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND I CANNOT TURN THEM OFF SEEING AS I DIDN'T TURN THEM ON.

ALSO, WITH THAT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THE VEHICLE BECOMES UNSTEADY AND IS HARD TO CONTROL. ONE LEAF SPRING SUPPORTING THE ENTIRE REAR END OF THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT WHICH IN PART WILL CAUSE THE SHOCKS TO WORK JUST THAT MUCH HARDER AND WEAR OUT MUCH FASTER.
