THIS ISSUE DID NOT DEPEND ON WHETHER I WAS DRIVING IN ROUGH TERRAIN AT NIGHT OR DURING THE DAY. NO MATTER WHERE I DRIVE THE TRUCK, IF THE LIGHTS ARE ON IT WILL BEGIN TO START BLINKING OFF AND THEN ON INTERMITTENTLY. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!

IN EACH INSTANCE THE TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE TIRE. THE TIRES WERE WELL MAINTAINED AND PROPERLY INFLATED.    AT 10:00AM, TRAVELING 65MPH ON INTERSTATE 35, NORTH OF DES MOINES, IOWA WE SUFFERED THE FIRST BLOWOUT. THERE WAS A LOUD WHUP, WHUP, WHUP NOISE AND THE VEHICLE BECAME DIFFICULT TO STEER. WE WERE ABLE TO SAFELY REDUCE SPEED AND PULL OVER. WE DISCOVERED THAT THE RIGHT REAR TIRE TREAD HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE SIDEWALL. WE HAD THE DAMAGED TIRE REPLACED IN AMES, IOWA AT A GOODYEAR DEALER.     AT OUR NEXT STOP, I CHECKED THE AIR PRESSURE IN ALL 4 TIRES. THE LEFT REAR TIRE WAS AT 32 PSI. I INFLATED THE LEFT REAR TIRE TO 40 PSI TO MATCH THE OTHER 3 TIRES.     WHILE TRAVELING 75 MPH ON INTERSTATE 80, EAST OF LARAMIE AT 11:00PM WE SUFFERED THE SECOND BLOWOUT. AGAIN THERE WAS A LOUD WHUP, WHUP, WHUP NOISE AND THE VEHICLE BECAME DIFFICULT TO STEER. I REDUCED SPEED AND ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE WHICH SENT THE TRUCK INTO A WILD FISHTAIL SKID. WE CRASHED INTO THE GUARDRAIL AND THE VEHICLE WAS RENDERED INOPERABLE. WE GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK AND SURVEYED THE DAMAGE. IT WAS THEN WE DISCOVERED THAT A PORTION OF THE LEFT REAR TIRE TREAD HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TIRE. THE INNER TUBE OF THE TIRE WAS EXPOSED BUT STILL INFLATED.    AFTER THE CRASH I WAS MADE AWARE OF A RECALL BY GOODYEAR OF THEIR WRANGLER TIRES. WHILE THE TIRES DESCRIBED ABOVE DO NOT FALL INTO THE DOT NUMBERS OF THE RECALL, I WOULD ASK THAT NHTSA INVESTIGATE FURTHER AND BROADEN THE RANGE OF RECALL AS THE BLOWOUT THAT CAUSED OUR CRASH APPEARS TO BE THE SAME AS THE BLOWOUT THAT CAUSED A CRASH IN TEXAS THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS ON AUGUST 01, 2011.   *TR",

CUSTOMER ID# [XXX] $892.82  ON JULY 14, 2011 I WAS MAKING A RIGHT TURN ONTO MAIN STREET IN TOMS RIVER WHEN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE EXPLODED, AND A FEW SECONDS LATER THE RIGHT TIRE ALSO EXPLODED. I DROVE ABOUT 100 FEET TO A PARKING LOT TO LOOK AT THE DAMAGE. ON THE INSIDE OF BOTH TIRES THERE WAS A LARGE GASH ABOUT 5 INCHES LONG ON ONE TIRE AND ON THE OTHER TIRE THERE WERE 2 DIFFERENT GASHES ABOUT 4 AND 5 INCHES LONG. I PUT A SPARE ON ONE WHEEL AND HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THE 2ND WHEEL OFF SO I HIT IT WITH THE LUG WRENCH. I TOOK THAT TIRE TO A NEARBY STS AND BOUGHT A CHEAP TIRE $171.00 AND PUT IT ON AND DROVE HOME. TWO DAYS LATER, SATURDAY JULY 16, 2011, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO GOODYEAR WHERE I PURCHASED THE TIRES LESS THEN A YEAR AGO. THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE THE BACK OF THE RIM WAS SCORED IT MUST NOT HAVE EXPLODED, IT MUST HAVE BEEN CUT IN A CARWASH. THEY CHARGED US $85.41 FOR 2 NEW TIRES. THEY TOLD US THIS DID NOT HAPPEN ON THE ROAD IT HAD TO HAVE HAPPENED AT A CAR WASH. THIS TRUCK HAS NEVER BEEN TO A CAR WASH SINCE I HAVE HAD IT SEVERAL YEARS. I HAD THEM REPLACE THE 2 BAD TIRES WITH GOODYEAR WRANGLER SR-A?S BUT I STILL HAVE 2 DUNLOP TIRES ON THE BACK OF MY TRUCK. I AM CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY, AND MY FAMILY?S SAFETY, DRIVING ON THESE TIRES. I HAVE A PICTURE OF ONE TIRE AND I HAVE PICTURES OF THE INSIDE OF THE RIMS. GOODYEAR KEPT BOTH TIRES.

I AM OUT $587 AND SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN.  I FEEL THAT THESE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE AND SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BECAUSE OF THIS.

IF THE WEATHER WAS WORSE OR I DID DRIVE MY VEHICLE OFF ROAD I DO BELIEVE MY BALL JOINT WOULD HAVE DETERIORATED AS A ACCELERATED RATE.

AND I HAVE RUN INTO A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRUCK THAT PEOPLE I KNOW SAY THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME MAKE OF VEHICLE. TO START WITH MY TRUCK ONLY HAS ABOUT 62,184 MILES ON IT, FOR A 2003 MODEL TRUCK, THAT IS CONSIDERED LOW MILEAGE. THE PROBLEMS I HAVE RUN INTO IS AS FOLLOWS: BOTH FRONT WHEEL HUB BEARING SETS HAVE PREMATURELY FAILED, IN PARTICULAR, THE RIGHT FRONT HUB TRIED TO LOCK UP ON ME AND ALMOST CAUSED ME TO LOOSE CONTROL OF THE TRUCK, I HAVE SINCE REPLACED THAT HUB BUT STILL NEED TO REPLACE THE LEFT FRONT BEFORE IT LOCKS UP:SECOND IS THAT THE STEERING AND SUSPENSION SYSTEM HAS NO PROVISIONS FOR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE, I.E. NO GREASE ZIRCS FOR THE BALL JOINTS, TIE RODS,UPPER AND LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS, WHEEL BEARINGS, ETC...CAUSING RAPID WEAR AND FAILURE:THIRD BIG ISSUE, I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED ALL FOUR BRAKE ROTORS DUE TO WARPAGE. THE BRAKE CALIPERS WERE BUILT WITH SOME TYPE OF COMPOSITE PLASTIC PISTONS THAT DISTORT DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT BUILD UP IN THE BRAKES. WHICH IN TURN CAUSES UNEVEN PAD CONTACT, THAT THEN CAUSES EXCESSIVE HEAT, ACCELERATED PAD WEAR, BRAKE FADE, ROTOR WARPAGE, AND AN AWFUL \"SQUEAL\" WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY BRAND NEW BRAKE PADS ARE ACTUALLY CRACKED NOW BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF THE CALIPERS AND THE HUBS GOING BAD: FOURTH ISSUE IS THAT THE TRANSMISSION CAUSES THE ENGINE TO OVER \"REV\" IN THE HIGHWAY PASSING GEAR ESPECIALLY WITH THE OVER DRIVE AND CRUISE CONTROL ON. WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND YOU GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE GAS TO GET AROUND SOMEBODY, THE ENGINE RPM'S SHOULDN'T GO UP TO SOMETIMES AROUND 7000, THAT IN TURN COULD CAUSE PREMATURE ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH DAIMLER-CHRYSLER ABOUT THESE CONCERNS BUT THEY JUST KEEP GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND AND NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. I STILL HAVE THE OLD PARTS ALSO.",

CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS ISSUE FOR ME AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR ADVISE IS? COPY OF PART OF THE CORRESPONDENCE TO DEALER FOLLOWS:    DODGE COUNTRY OF APPLETON  4400 WEST COLLEGE AVENUE     AS YOU CAN CONFIRM WE HAVE HAD OUR 2003 DODGE DAKOTA IN THREE OR MORE TIMES NOW TO TRY AND FIX THE CRUISE CONTROL. [XXX]     THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO MAIN SYMPTOMS:    1)  UNEXPECTED SHIFT INTO HIGH GEAR WHEN THE VEHICLE IS ON CRUISE CONTROL -   THESE EVENTS DO NOT SEEM TO COINCIDE WITH ANY SPECIFIC ROAD CONDITION.    2) NON - RESPONSIVE CRUISE CONTROL -  THE VEHICLE SPEED DRIFTS  DOWN 10 MPH OR MORE OFF OF SET POINT  ON A VERY GRADUAL INCLINE WITH NO RESPONSE AT ALL BY THE CRUISE CONTROL.   ONCE YOU REACH LEVEL ROAD THE SPEED WILL VERY SLOWLY CREEP UP OVER WHAT SEEMS LIKE SEVERAL MILES.   THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN CONSISTENTLY OR REPEAT UNDER ANY SPECIFIC ROAD CONDITION.    SOMETIMES  AT 60 - 70 MPH ON BOTH GENTLE AND STEEP INCLINES THE CRUISE WORKS FINE.  SPEED MAY ONLY DROP OF ONE OR TWO MPH AND THE ENGINE DOESN'T EVEN SHIFT INTO A HIGHER GEAR.  YET UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS, SOMETIMES AT THE SAME SPEEDS OF 60 - 70 MPH THE CRUISE WILL RESPOND BY KICKING INTO THE NEXT HIGHER GEAR AND OTHER TIMES THE CRUISE WILL NOT RESPOND AT ALL LET THE SPEED DROP DOWN 10MPH.        TOO  SLOW A SPEED IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS TOO FAST A SPEED.  ANOTHER PERSON I ASKED WITH AN IDENTICAL VEHICLE INDICATED SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

WHEN I NOTICED THE ERRONEOUS OUTPUT FROM THE COMPUTER I ASKED MY DEALER TO INVESTIGATE. THIS IS WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT I HAD A 20 GALLON TANK AND THAT MY MODEL WOULD NOT ACCEPT A 22 GALLON TANK. THEY ALSO MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD OTHERS ON THEIR LOT AT THE TIME WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH DODGE HAS PRINTED NEW WINDOW STICKERS FOR SINCE THEN. THE ONLY THING THEY COULD DO IS ADJUST THE COMPUTER TO BE CORRECT. MY COMPLAINT REVOLVES AROUND THE TRUCKS THAT WERE SOLD WITH THIS CONDITION, I BELIEVE A TSB SHOULD BE ISSUED TO CORRECT THE COMPUTERS TO 20 GALLON TANKS AND TO NOTIFY THE OWNERS OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM. SINCE BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO DODGES ATTENTION, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY EVASIVE IN THEIR RESPONSE WHEN I ASKED WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO FOR ALL THE OWNERS AFFECTED BY THIS. I BELIEVE IT POSES A POTENTIAL SAFETY PROBLEM IN THAT IF AN OWNER RELIES ON THE COMPUTER, THEY COULD RUN OUT OF GAS AT AN INOPPURTUNE TIME. LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FREEWAY.*AK",

FIRST TIME IN MAY, 1 MONTH AFTER PURCHASE, THE DEALER REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER WITH A \"FLASH UPDATE\" AND ADJUSTED THROTTLE LINKAGE. THAT WAS NO HELP.  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER I TOOK IT IN FOR THE SAME  PROBLEM, AND DEALER FOUND NOTHING WRONG.  THE THIRD TIME, JANUARY 2004, I TOOK A TECHNICIAN FOR A TEST DRIVE, AND HE AGREED THAT THE TRUCK WAS NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY.  THEY REPLACED THE \"VALVE BODY\" IN THE TRANSMISSION AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOW GOTTEN WORSE.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE TRUCK IS NOW HAVING PROBLEM SHIFTING OUT OF PARK.  THEY CLAIM THEY NEED TO REPLACE THE SAME PART THEY JUST INSTALLED, THEY SAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DEFECTIVE \"VALVE\".  FURTHERMORE, THE TECHNICIAN IS NOW SAYING THE ORIGINAL SHIFTING PROBLEM IS NORMAL BECAUSE DODGE REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION TO AVOID MULTIPLE UP & DOWN SHIFTING WHEN GOING UP A GRADE. THIS WAS DOWN TO PUT \"LESS STRESS\" ON THE TRANSMISSION.   DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DODGE IS SAVING THE TRANSMISSION BY MAKING IT WORK LESS AND DESTROYING  THE ENGINE BY LETTING IT REV AT 5000 RPM.....    P.S. THIS SHIFTING PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE THE DAY I DROVE THE TRUCK  OFF THE LOT.  *LA",
