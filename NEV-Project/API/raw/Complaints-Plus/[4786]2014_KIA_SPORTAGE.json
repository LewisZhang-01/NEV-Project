I really hadn\u2019t ran into any issues with it. Until the day after Christmas 12/26/2021.   There was no indication whatsoever that there was a mechanical failure to the engine about to happen. No warning lights. Nothing. As I was running about 80 mph on 71 Southbound I started to hear a \u201cflapping\u201d noise. Within 5 miles, and thank the Lord I was now on an exit ramp slowing down - the engine locked up!!  After doing some research I quickly found out this is a predominant issue with KIA engines. The manufacturing was faulty and it causes premature wear of the crankshaft bearing and metal shavings wrecking havoc on the engine.   Due to being a secondary owner it is not under warranty and because I did not receive any notification at all from the manufacturer that there was a product improvement order for the vehicle, KIA will not assist with any of the cost. I now have a vehicle that was running just fine the day before yesterday, that has 84,000 miles on it, maintained properly, that I still owe on that does not run and is going to cost me $6,500 to get fixed.   There was a class action lawsuit with a 1.3 billion dollar settlement because KIA knew they were manufacturing junk engines but apparently I missed out on that and I am not eligible due to the product improvement, that I knew nothing about, was not completed. My VIN has 0 unrepaired recalls on the KIA and the NHTSA government websites. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not a safety recall.   I keep reminding myself that things could\u2019ve been worse and I am leaning on my faith to help me remain as calm about the situation as possible.",

MY NEXT ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED WAS AT DANBURY KIA IN DANBURY CONN. TO MY AMAZEMENT THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE PROBLEM IN THE COMPUTER. A CALL TO THE OTHER DEALER CONFIRMED MY VISIT BUT NO RECORD OF THE TIRE SENSOR PROBLEM.

THE CAR HAS BARELY 2000 MILES ON IT AND HAS SPENT MOST OF THE TIME IN THE SHOP.  I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT  AS I AM AFRAID I WILL PULL INTO TRAFFIC AND GET HIT IF THE ENGINE STALLS OUT.

I AM SO ANGRY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME I HAVE SPENT WITH IT IN THE SHOP, BUT MORE SO DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO RUN INTO THE SAME ISSUE I HAVE BEEN HAVING...
