THEN I HIT THE OTHER CAR MY VEHICLE STOPPED AFTER THE HIT BUT AS SOON AS THE OTHER VEHICLE MOVED FORWARD TO PULL TO SIDE MY CAR HIT IT AGAIN AND MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE, I PULLED MY E BRAKE AND MY CAR STOPPED. I REPORTED THE ISSUE TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR A BRAND NEW CAR AFTER 6 MO THA OF PURCHASE TO DO THAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAD THE COLLISION BRAKING THING WERE THE CAR BRAKES FOR YOU IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO ANOTHER CAR. FIRST THE BODY WORK REPAIRS WERE DONE ON MY CAR THEN MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP WERE THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE MY CAR PART TO SEE WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND I WOULD BE CALLED WHEN THEY FOUND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG, I WAS CALLED AND TOLD MY CAR IS FIXED NOW AND IT IS READY FOR PICK UP. I CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE WHICH THEN DIRECTED ME TO THE REGIONAL MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THE REASON MY CAR DIDN'T STOP IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO FLOOR MATS AND ONE SLIPPED AND BLOCKED MY PEDAL, WHICH WAS CLEARLY NOT THE REASON. I WAS TIRED OF GETTING RIDICULOUS ANSWERS AND SURPRISING RIGHT AFTER ALL THIS HAPPENED MY ANTI COLLISION BRAKING SYSTEM STARTS WORKING BUT NOT DURING ANY COLLISIONS BUT JUST REGULAR DRIVING. I COMPLAINED ABOUT HAT AND MY BRAKES AGAIN JUST RECENTLY AND I WA STOLE THAT MY BRAKE PADS ARE WORN OUT AND ROTORS AS WELL AND MY TIRES. I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW 2017 AND IT ONLY HAS 28,000 MILES ON IT. I DON'T EVEN DRIVE IT CRAZY OR HARSH. I HAD TO GET MY BRAKE PADS REPLACED AND ROTORS.",

I TOOK MY PASSAT TO TWO DEALERS, BOTH SUPPOSEDLY CHECKED IT AND SAID IT TESTED 100%  A WEEK LATER, THE CAR DID NOT SLOW AT ALL WHEN I WAS CLOSE TO A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME GOING 65 MILES AND HOUR AND IT SLAMMED ON ITS BRAKES. IF I HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION, A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED.  I WROTE A LETTER REGARDING MY CONCERNS TO MR. HINRICH WOEBCKEN, CEO OF VW OF AMERICA. THE RESPONSE FROM VW WAS THAT MY SYSTEM WORKS FINE ACCORDING TO THEIR DEALERS, AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING FURTHER FOR ME!  AFTER THAT, I DID SOME RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THE RESULTS OF FRONT COLLISION  PREVENTION TESTING THAT WAS DONE BY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY. THEIR TESTS ON 2017 CARS INCLUDED THOSE OF OVER 20 MANUFACTURERS.  THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT PARTS TO THE TEST:  FORWARD COLLISION WARNING (ON THE PASSAT THIS IS A TWO CAR SYMBOL IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER)   LOW SPEED AUTO BRAKE (THIS IS FOR SPEED UNDER 12 MPH)  HIGH-SPEED AUTO BRAKE (THIS IS FOR SPEEDS OVER 25 MPH)    THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS SHOWS THAT ALL COMPARABLE MANUFACTURER'S SEDANS EITHER SCORED 2 OR 3 POINTS ON THE HIGH-SPEED AUTO BRAKE TEST. HOWEVER THE VW PASSAT SCORED \"0\" POINTS, AND WAS UNABLE BRAKE THE CAR OR REDUCE THE CAR SPEED AT ALL! THE 2017 VW TOUAREG ALSO FAILED THE HIGH- SPEED AUTO BRAKE PORTION OF THE TEST.     I FEEL THAT VW NEEDS TO INFORM OWNERS, AND STOP ADVERTISING THAT THEIR CARS HAVE A FUNCTIONING HIGH-SPEED AUTO BRAKING, AS THEY DO NOT!
