        "summary": "On Wednesday, January 12, 2022, while driving from Columbia, SC to Cincinnati, we were heading northwest through the mountains of North Carolina, on I-40, just east of the TN border.  Traffic was fairly steady and heavy, so we were traveling at approximately 45 MPH, in the right lane, winding through the mountains. Our friend, ** ***** was driving, my wife, ********* *****, was sitting in the right front passenger seat, working on her laptop, and I was sitting immediately behind her, also working on my laptop.  With a semi-trailer truck slowing ahead of us, *** signaled to make a lane change into the left lane (this is only a two lane highway).  As we were transitioning to the left lane, the vehicle suddenly \u2013 without any warning or driver inputs \u2013 slammed on its brakes, bringing the truck to a sudden and violent stop.  Given the violent halting of the truck, we all assumed we had been rear-ended by a truck.  The braking was so serious, luggage from the rear of the vehicle shot forward like a missile, striking my wife in the back of the head.  She suffered what we believe to be a concussion, and she did seek medical attention in the days following the incident. Sitting behind her, the sudden stopping action caused me to twist my left knee, resulting in what might be a cartilage tear.  I also saw my physician in the days following, and he acknowledged the swelling of the left knee.  He advised me to monitor the knee carefully, and if the pain persists, to get an MRI.  The pain has not gone away, and I plan to get an MRI in the next week or so. Our friend suffered a severely strained back in the incident, and has been treating his back with both ice and heat therapy.  This was the THIRD time this happened, each nearly resulting in a tragic accident.  The dealer said \"it's just a software glitch.\"  The \"Brake Assist\" program is clearly defective and unsafe.",

GMC does not think it is a safety issue but it is - the vehicle slows down and there is little power to drive.  Yesterday I was pulling a bass boat and only made it home with great difficulty.

THE TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS ON THE DASH ARE TOO SMALL AND LOCATED WITH MANY OTHER LIGHTS/INDICATORS, SO THEY CANNOT BE SEEN QUICKLY NOR 'EASILY' AND CAN'T BE HEARD UNDER NORMAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. THIS CREATES AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH DRIVER DISTRACTION TRYING TO SEE IF A TURN SIGNAL HAS BEEN ACTIVATED AND INCREASES THE RISK OF VEHICLES NEXT TO THE TRUCK NOT EXPECTING A LANE CHANGE IF THEY ARE AHEAD OF THE TAIL LIGHTS. NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE, I'VE ALMOST RUN INTO ADJACENT VEHICLES I COULDN'T 'SEE' BECAUSE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM DOES NOT DETECT VEHICLES WELL ENOUGH TO AVOID TURNING INTO THEM AND ALSO BECAUSE I WAS DISTRACTED TRYING TO SEE THE TURN INDICATOR ON THE DASHBOARD, OOK INTO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND WATCH MY DISTANCE TO CARS IN FRONT OF ME. THE TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS ON THE MIRRORS ON THE PRIOR MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DRIVER DISTRACTIONS AND INCREASED SAFETY TO THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS AND ADJACENT VEHICLES. GM MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR REMOVING SAFETY FEATURES!  THEY MUST BE FORCED TO REPLACE THE MIRRORS WITH ONES THAT HAVE TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS IN THEM LIKE ON PRIOR MODEL YEARS.  IF IT'S NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, WHY DID THEY HAVE THE INDICATORS IN THE MIRRORS BEFORE?? REMOVING THE MIRROR SIGNAL LIGHTS WAS OBVIOUSLY A SICK WAY FOR GM TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS WITH INTENDED DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF IT'S OWNERS, PASSENGERS AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD.   THESE PROBLEMS EXIST WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED (BLIND SPOT ISSUES), TURNING, CHANGING LANES AND MOVING ON EVERY TYPE OF ROADWAY, BUT ESPECIALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHERE HUNDREDS OF FEET ARE TRAVELED IN ONLY A FEW SECONDS, AND DISTRACTIONS BECOME EVEN MORE UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS TO EVERYONE.",

DUE TO GM'S DESIRE TO SAVE MONEY AND COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR DRIVER, PASSENGER AND OTHER VEHICLES SAFETY, THE DRIVER HAS TO REACH OUT TO THE SW RESULTING AT DANGEROUS ELBOW ANGLES. IN PERFORMANCE CARS, THE SW IS DESIGNED TO BE CLOSE TO THE DRIVER BECAUSE PHYSICS PRINCIPLES OF TORQUE REVEAL: THE GREATER THE ANGLE OF REACH, THE MORE TORQUE IT REQUIRES TO TURN THE SW. SO REACHING OUT WITH THE ELBOW AT ZERO TO 10 DEGREES REQUIRES A MUCH LONGER REACH, THUS GREATER FORCE/TORQUE AND LONGER REACTION TIME, THAN HAVING THE SW AT A 30-40 DEGREE 'ELBOW BEND'. THE POINT IS, FOR A DRIVER TO TURN THE SW ON THIS VEHICLE, IT TAKES TOO MUCH STRENGTH AND TOO LONG A REACTION TIME TO SAFELY OPERATE IT. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS MODEL LIKE I DID WITH PRIOR MODEL YEARS. WITH THIS 'LAND YACHT' HAVING AN EVEN LONGER WHEELBASE THAN BEFORE, THE DISTANCE TO THE SW IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL IN REGARDS TO REACTION TIME AND SAFE DRIVING! PLUS, SINCE THE SW IS SO CLOSE TO THE DASHBOARD, WHEN I RAISE MY LEG TO STEP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL (WHICH NOW I HAVE TO DO BECAUSE GM ALSO TOOK AWAY THE FOOT PEDAL ADJUSTER!), MY LEG HITS THE BOTTOM OF THE SW!
