I THEN SAW THE WORDS \"POWER STEERING\" APPEAR ON MY DISPLAY. AT THAT VERY MOMENT MY STEERING WHEEL FROZE UP TO WHERE I BASICALLY COULD NOT MOVE IT ANY MORE. I COULD NOT TURN LEFT OR RIGHT, WHICH FORCED ME TO KEEP STRAIGHT. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND HAD TO KEEP GOING UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A STOP, TURN MY CAR OFF AND BACK ON, THEN IT ALLOWED ME TO DRIVE HOME. FROM THAT POINT ON, MY STEERING WHEEL ITSELF HAS BEGAN TO TWIST AND TURN BACK AND FORTH WHILE VIBRATING, WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ME, AND IT DOES THIS ALL WHILE I'M DRIVING. I'M FORCED TO BASICALLY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL WITH A TIGHT GRIP TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT. SINCE THAT DAY, MY POWER STEERING HAS WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING ABOUT 4 OR 5 TIMES, AND MORE THAN THAT IF YOU COUNT WHEN I FIRST START IT UP IN THE MORNING. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN IN WHICH THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY SERVICED MY VEHICLE FOR THIS PROBLEM ON 11/26/16... WHICH WAS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO, SO I AM NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN, DUE TO A POSTCARD I RECEIVED ABOUT A FEW RECALLS, I WAS NOT HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE POWER STEERING WHAT SO EVER. I AM ABOUT 3 MONTHS SHORT OF A YEAR AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IF THIS PROBLEM WAS FIXED PROPERLY, HOW IT WOULD BECOME A PROBLEM FOR ME SO QUICK! I HAVE 2 CHILDREN I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR AND I RELY HEAVILY ON MY VEHICLE. FROM READING ONLINE, THIS IS A SERIOUS, COMMON, AND VERY WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM. AS STATED BEFORE, AT THE TIME THEY SAY THAT THEY SERVICED IT, IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME. SO IS IT COMMON FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK TO GO BAD WITHIN A YEAR? I REALLY NEED MY CAR AND CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY THE HIGH COST FOR THIS REPAIR, BUT MOST IMPORTANT I CAN NOT RISK DRIVING MY CHILDREN AROUND IN A VEHICLE THAT IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE. I NEED HELP",

I PARKED MY CAR IN A PARKING GARAGE WENT TO THE APPOINTMENT AND WHEN I CAME BACK TO MY CAR AND TURNED IT ON THE POWER STEERING MESSAGE CAME ACROSS THE RADIO SCREEN.  I TRIED TO GET MY CAR OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE AND I WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL IT AND ALMOST HIT 2 CARS BEFORE FINALLY BEING ABLE TO MANEUVER MY CAR BACK INTO ITS ORIGINAL SPOT WITH NO STEERING CONTROL.  I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY SAID ITS AS A SENSOR IN POWER STEERING BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE SAME SENSOR AS THE ONE RECALLED IN THE 05 06 08 AND 09 MODELS.  I FIND THIS EXTREMELY HARD TO BELIEVE CONSIDERING MY CAR HAS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM AS THOSE MODELS AND 07 WAS THE ONLY YEAR LEFT OUT.

I TOOK MY CAR TO THE WESLEY CHAPEL GM DEALER AND THEY COMPLETED THE RECALL WORK FOR FREE.

MY HANDS WERE TIED AS I NEED MY CAR SO I PAID THE FEE AT THE DEALERSHIP AND CALLED GM AND HAD THEM OPEN UP A TICKET TO LOOK INTO MY ISSUE, CHARGES, AND WHAT THE DEALERSHIP FIXED. GM RESPONDED TO ME THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP ME. NOW, THINKING ALL OF THIS WAS BEHIND ME, I RECEIVE ANOTHER RECALL LETTER WITH THE SAME RECALL NUMBER THIS MONTH (JAN 2015), NOW TELLING ME I STILL HAVE AN OPEN RECALL.

THE THIRD TIME WAS YESTERDAY, 6/2/14, MILEAGE 49852, THIS IS GETTING TO BE RIDICULOUS THAT I KEEP HAVING TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING UNIT ON THIS VEHICLE. COUNTING THE ORIGINAL, THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH POWER STEERING UNIT. WHEN THE PUMP FAILS, ALL DRIVEABILITY IS LOST, AND THE CAR BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER. LUCKILY, IN TWO OF THE  INCIDENTS, I WAS DRIVING A  SPEED OF AROUND 35MPH.     YESTERDAY'S FAILURE HAPPENED IN OUR DRIVEWAY. MY WIFE WAS GETTING READY TO GO TO DENVER, AND WAS TO BE DRIVING ON I-25. NOW I'M NOT SURE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE FAILURE HAPPENED ON THE INTERSTATE, BUT I NOW HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOT CONFIDENCE THAT THIS 2007 MALIBU IS SAFE TO DRIVE ON THE ROAD. GM SHOULD OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING UNITS, IN THESE CARS, FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. AVERAGING A LIFE OF 12K MILES FOR THE UNIT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.     I WOULD LOVE IF THE CEO OF GM, [XXX], WOULD TAKE THIS CAR OFF MY HANDS FOR ABOUT A MONTH, AND USE IT TO DRIVE HER FAMILY AROUND.

THE THIRD TIME, AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW POWER STEERING MOTOR THEY ESSENTIALLY SAID THEY MADE SOME \"ADJUSTMENTS.\"  NEVERTHELESS, THE PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP WHO BASICALLY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO (READ, \"WOULD DO\"), AND ALL HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO DO WAS TO GIVE ME A VOUCHER TOWARDS THE PURCHASE OF ANY VEHICLE ON THEIR LOT, NEW OR USED.

BOTH MY DEALER AND GM CUSTOMER CARE TOLD ME THERE WERE NO ACTIVE RECALLS, AND THAT I JUST NEED TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED MYSELF AND THEN I COULD REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT AT A FUTURE DATE IF ANY RECALL DID HAPPEN.  IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT A COMPANY AS LARGE AS GM WOULDN'T PROACTIVELY HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS WHEN A KNOWN PROBLEM EXISTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES.    ALSO MENTIONED IN THIS ARTICLE WERE PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE CRUISE CONTROL.  MY CRUISE CONTROL WILL RANDOMLY STOP WORKING, OR NOT EVEN ALLOW ME THE OPTION OF USING CRUISE.  THIS IS NOT AS BIG OF A SAFETY CONCERN AS THE BRAKE LIGHT ISSUE, BUT AGAIN, MENTION OF THIS PROBLEM OCCURING IS ONE MORE REASON I BELIEVE GM SHOULD BE MORE PROACTIVE IN HELPING THEIR CUSTOMERS DEAL WITH THE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND CONCERNS ALREADY BEING ADDRESS/INVESTIGATED BY THE NHTSA.  *TR",

THE CAR CAN BE FULL OF GAS AND IT WILL SHOW IT IS ON EMPTY. WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE CAR THE AIR BAG SIGNS WOULD COME ON AND WE TOOK IT BACK TO GM DEALER AND THEY COULD NEVER FIND ANY PROBLEM. ALSO THE SEAT BELT LIGHT COMES ON AND YOUR HAVE YOUR SEAT BELT ON. THIS CAR HAS ALSO HAS JUST BEEN AT THE DEALERS FOR REPAIR FOR THE ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING PROBLEMS, VERY SCARY. IT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS CAR DYING ON YOU IF YOU ARE ON THE HIGHWAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH  THIS CAR ARE STRANGE AND THINGS LIKE THE FUEL GAUGE, POWER STEERING YOU WOULD THINK  YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH. I THINK THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THE FUEL PUMP AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF IT HAD ANY THING TO DO WITH THE FUEL GAUGE NOT WORKING. THEY SURE DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO.   *TR",

THE JERKS ARE NOT CONTROLLABLE BY TWO HANDS. OFTEN WHILE DRIVING, THE CAR LOOKS AS IF IT IS JERKING BACK AND FORTH IN ITS LANE DUE TO THE ROUGH JERKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL. THIS IS THE MOST NERVE RACKING WHILE DRIVING IN WEATHER SUCH AS SNOW OR RAIN, WHERE THE ROAD IS SLICK OR SLIPPERY. HAVING THE CAR JERK AROUND ON ICE IS JUST AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.

THEN, SINCE JUNE 17, THE EMPTY SIGN HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE ALERT ENGINE SIGN. UNTIL THE END OF JULY, THE TWO ALERTS WOULD ROUTINELY DISAPPEAR AFTER I HAVE DRIVEN FOR ABOUT  100 MILES OR AFTER A DAY OR TWO DAYS. BUT FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS NOW, THE TWO ALERTS CAN STAY FOR A WEEK AND BEYOND 100 MILES. BUT THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR AND WOULD REAPPEAR ONCE I PUT NEW GASOLINE IN THE CAR OR FILL OUT THE TANK. ON AUGUST 18, 2011, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A MECHANIC AND THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT IS WAS THE FAILURE OF THE GAS TANK SENSOR. SAYING THAT THE GAS TANK WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT TO INSTALL A NEW SENSOR.

I GRASP THE STEERING WHEEL AS TIGHT AS I CAN TRYING TO PULL BACK INTO MY LANE WITH THE WHEEL FIGHTING ME BACK AND FORTH.  WHAT A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE.  I PULL OFF (SHAKING MY --- OFF) MAKE A PHONE CALL, SIT FOR 1/2 HOUR (STILL AFRAID TO DRIVE).  WHILE THE CAR IS IDLING THE WHEEL IS BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH IN PARK.  I PUT IT IN DRIVE WITH MY FOOT HELD TIGHTLY ON THE BRAKE AND IT IS STILL JUMPING.  PUT IT BACK IN PARK.  BUILD UP A LITTLE NERVE.  PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE AND START TO DRIVE.  EVERYTHING IS FINE.  GET TO WORK 5 MINUTES FROM THERE ONLY TO FIND THAT MY CAR HAS AN ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING?  SOME MORON MUST HAVE DREAMT THIS UP AND GM NEEDS TO CORRECT THIS HORRIBLE POWER ASSIST CRAP BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.  I AM NOT VERY HAPPY WITH MY CHEVY MALIBU AND I THINK A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT NEEDS TO BE FILED FOR ALL CHEVY MALIBU OWNERS TO MAKE GM MAKE CORRECTIONS ON THIS LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.  ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *TR",

THE DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER ('DIC') IS THE GREEN LED DISPLAY IN THE RADIO THAT NORMALLY DISPLAYS SUCH INFO AS TIME AND TEMPERATURE, ETC., BUT IT IS ALSO USED BY CHEVY TO DISPLAY WARNING MESSAGES.    THE TWO PROBLEMS ARE:  A). CRITICAL WARNINGS ' IN MY CASE A WARNING MESSAGE TO 'SERVICE AIRBAG' POPPED UP ONE EVENING ON THE DIC ' BUT  IT WAS ONLY DISPLAYED ONCE (IT DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING OR THEREAFTER). SINCE CHEVY CONSIDERED THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED, I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PROGRAMMED THIS WARNING (OR ANY SAFETY RELATED WARNING) TO STAY ON UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED.    B). THE DIC IS FAR TOO DIM TO SEE CLEARLY DURING MOST DAYLIGHT HOURS (EVEN ON MANY CLOUDY DAYS) AND IS FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES TOTALLY INVISIBLE IF THE DRIVER IS WEARING SUNGLASSES.
