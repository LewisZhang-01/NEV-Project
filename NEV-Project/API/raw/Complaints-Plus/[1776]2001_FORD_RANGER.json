I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IF THIS COMPONENT IS NOT FIXED IMMEDIATELY, THAT IT COULD CAUSE THE OIL PUMP TO THE ENGINE TO FAIL, RESULTING IN THE ENGINE LOSING POWER. THIS COULD CAUSE THE LOSS OF BRAKES, AND STEERING. I WAS TOLD BY SEVERAL OTHER RANGER OWNERS TO RECOMMEND THIS TO THE NHTSA. IT SHOULD BE RECALLED AND ALL 3.0L RANGER'S SHOULD HAVE THERE SYNCHRONIZER REPAIRED OR REPLACED. THIS COMPONENT FAILING COULD RESULT IN MAJOR ENGINE DAMAGE, INJURY AND DEATH. THANK YOU! *TR",

THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN \u001cLABORING OR BUCKING\u001d  WHEN IT WOULD COME TO A STOP.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO RED MCCOMBS FORD OF  SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. THEY PROMISED TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE THE NEXT DAY. I RECEIVED A CALL THE NEXT DAY THAT THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETE AND I COULD PICK UP MY VEHICLE.   I GAVE MY NAME TO GIRL AT SERVICE DESK FOR THE PAPERWORK. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A PROBLEM FINDING MY PAPERWORK. AFTER SPELLING MY NAME IN ENGLISH, SPELLING IN PHONETICS (ECHO, DELTA, ETC), AND FINALLY WRITING IN A PIECE OF PAPER SHE STILL COULD NOT FIND THE PAPERWORK.  THEN, SHE CALLED SERVICE ADVISOR WHO BROUGHT HIS PAPERWORK AND STILL COULD NOT FIND MY PAPERWORK. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AFTER FORTY MINUTES THE PAPERWORK WAS FOUND ON ANOTHER PILE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SERVICE GIRL\u0019S DESK. SHE THEN PRESENTED ME WITH A BILL OF $65.00 FOR THE REPAIR.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE.  SHE CALLED THE TOP SERVICE MANGER AND HE TOLD ME, THAT REPAIR DIDN\u0019T INVOLVE A PART CHANGE; I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A DIAGNOSIS FEE.  MY PATIENCE HAD JUST BEEN SURPASSED AND I DEMANDED TO SEE THE TOP GUN AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I WAS TAKEN INTO THE OFFICE OF CHARLES HYLTON, SERVICE DIRECTOR WHO PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN THE SAME STORY.  AT THIS POINT I WAS AT MY WITS END AND DECIDED I WOULD SPLIT THE BILL; HOWEVER, THIS WAS THE LAST TIME THEY WERE GOING TO SEE ME. HE THEN TRUMPED ME AND OFFERED TO PAY THE WHOLE BILL. I EXPLAINED THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT FIRST.  I FEEL THEY ATTEMPTED TO WEAR ME DOWN, SO I COULD JUST PAY THE $65.00 AND MOVE ON BY MY BUSINESS. I HAVE NO CO-PAY AND THEY KNEW IT!

TALKED TO OUR FORD DEALER IN TOWN AND THEY SAY ALOT OF THE ESCAPES THAT USE THE SAME TRANSMISSION AND COOLING SYSTEM HAVE LOST TRANSMISSION DUE TO THIS.  THE SAME TRANSMISSION IS ALSO USED IN THE MAZDA AND MY BOSS AT WORK JUST HAD HIS GO OUT AT 15,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  IT SEEMS FORD KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT IS NOT INCLINED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  MY VEHICLE DURING COLD DAYS ( BELOW 30 ) ACTS LIKE SOMEONE IS PUTTING THE CLUTCH IN AND OUT VERY RAPIDLY WHEN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT WHEN IT IS FIRST DRIVEN.  HAD IT AT THE DEALER LAST YEAR BEFORE MY FORD WARRENTY EXPIRED AND THEY FOUND NOTHING.  OF COUSE IF WAS ABOVE 40 THAT DAY.  ANY INFLUENCE THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO FORD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WOULD BE HELPFUL.

ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE I STARTED HAVING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, THE \"OVERDRIVE OFF\" LIGHT FLASHING AND FUNNY SHIFTS FROM FIRST INTO SECOND AS WELL AS A HESITANT ACCELERATION FOLLOWED BY A SMALL JERK.  I TOOK IT IN TO HAVE IT FIXED AND APPARENTLY IT WAS.  ABOUT 3 MONTHS LATER THE TRANSMISSION STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN IN THE SAME FASHION. I TOOK IT IN AND ONCE AGAIN THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED UNTIL A FEW MONTHS LATER IT STARTED DOING THE SAME THING. BY THIS TIME SINCE I THOUGHT THE TRUCK WAS FINALLY FIXED I DECIDED TO ADD A 4\" SUSPENSION LIFT AND 33\" TIRES.  WHEN I TOOK IT IN THEY TOLD ME I NEED EITHER A NEW TRANSMISSION OR TO HAVE THIS ONE REBUILT AND THAT THE WARRANTY WOULD COVER THE COST.  AFTER ABOUT A WEEK IN THE SHOP AND TORN APART THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME THE WARRANTY CO. DID NOT WANT TO PAY FOR THE REBUILT TRANSMISSION BECAUSE OF THE \"EXTENSIVE SUSPENSION MODS\" AND LARGER TIRES.  LET ME REMIND YOU, I HAD IT IN 2 TIMES BEFORE THE LIFT WAS PUT ON FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN FIXED. AFTER A BIT OF ARGUING I DECIDED THAT I WASN'T GOING TO WIN AND THAT I NEED A TRUCK.  SO I AM NOW PAYING $150 A MONTH FOR THE $3000+ FOR THE WORK AND REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  NOW, AFTER ABOUT 4 MONTHS AFTER THE WORK, I AM EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM YET AGAIN...CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ADVISE ME ON HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM ???  THANKS, AARON.    *NLM",

BY THE TIME I TRAVELED THE APPROXIMATE 10 MILES, I HAD TOTALLY LOST REVERSE GEAR AND HAD SUBSTANTIAL SLIPPAGE OCCURING IN FORWARD GEARS.  MECHANICS INSPECTED THE TRANSMISSION AND DISCOVERED SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION REQUIRING IT TO BE REPLACED.  FORD TECH CONSULTANTS REVEALED THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY FORD RANGERS, BUT NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  APPARENTLY, THE TORQUE ON THE TRANSMISSION WAS INCREASED WITHOUT REDESIGNING THE TRANSMISSION OR SEALS TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE HIGHER TORQUE.  THEREFORE, TRANSMISSION SEALS ARE FAILING UNDER USE, LEADING TO SEVERE DAMAGE OF THE TRANSMISSION.  FURTHERMORE, FORD HAS NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE --- EVEN THOUGH THE DAMAGE OCCURRED ON 4/11/01, A NEW REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION WON'T BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AT LEAST 4/20/01, AN UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION.  APPARENTLY MY TRUCK WON'T BE ABLE TO BE RETURNED TO ME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  FORD TECH CONSULTANTS REVEALED THAT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT A RECALL, BUT HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.  MY TRUCK ONLY HAS 9,200 MILES ON IT --- I HAVE HAD IT LESS THAN 4 MONTHS.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND REQUIRE FORD TO ASSUME ITS RESPONSIBILITIES BY REQUIRING A RECALL, BY REQUIRING TIMELY REPAIRS, AND BY ASSUMING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
