THE PROBLEM AREA OF THE SUBFRAME IS RIGHT UNDER THE DRAIN HOLE FOR THE A/C EVAPORATOR. THE SUBFRAME TO THE DRIVER SIDE IS CLEAN AND HAS NO RUST ISSUE. THE LOCATION OF THE RUST AREA SUGGESTS THAT IT MAY BE RELATED TO THE DRAIN HOLE OF THE A/C SYSTEM OR/AND SOMETHING SIMILAR (SUCH AS RAIN) THAT HAD LED TO WATER STAYING IN THE AREA. THE RUST IS GETTING WORSE OVER TIME.     I CHECKED IT TODAY (JULY 23, 2015) AFTER NOTICING YELLOWISH DRIPPING MARKS LEFT ON THE DRIVER WAY. MY WIFE DROVE THE CAR THE DAY BEFORE WHEN THERE WAS A HEAVY RAIN. THE CAR WAS PARKED ON THE DRIVE WAY (UP HILL ABOUT 15 DEGREES) OVER NIGHT. WHEN SHE PULLED THE CAR OUT OF THE DRIVE WAY THE NEXT DAY, WE SAW YELLOWISH WATER DRIPPING FROM UNDER THE CAR. SO, I LOOKED AT THE AREA. FOR SURE, IT'S GETTING WORSE THAN LAST YEAR. I PUNCHED AROUND AND GOT ABOUT A COUPLE OF SPOONFULS OF RUST OFF THE FRAME. I USED MY PRY BAR TO PRY AROUND THE AREA AND I CAN SEE THAT THE FRAME IS GETTING VERY WEAK.     NOW I CAN SEE THE RUST IS PROGRESSING OVER TIME. AS THE AREA IS GETTING MORE RUSTED, THE STRUCTURE IS LOSING ITS STRENGTH. THE LOWER CONTROL ARM AND/OR THE STABILIZING BAR WILL COME OFF THE FRAME, CAUSING DISASTER ON THE ROAD.     I SEARCHED THE INERNET ON THE ISSUE (\"HONDA ACCORD SUBFRAME RUST\"). THE ISSUE SEEMS VERY COMMON. THERE MUST BE A DESIGN FLAW (A/C DRAIN OR RAIN WATER) WITH THE CAR. IT SEEMS THAT THE ISSUE HAD NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN CARE OF BY HONDA. I AM URGING SOMEBODY LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE AND HAVE HONDA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.    THANKS.",

IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGHT THE VEHICLE IS LEAPING FORWARD. THERE ARE EVEN TIMES WHEN I TRY TO TAKE OFF AFTER STOPPING IN TRAFFIC, THE CAR BEHAVES AS THOUGH IT IS IN NEUTRAL WHEN TRYING TO SHIFT FROM FIRST GEAR TO SECOND GEAR. MY ENGINE LIGHT DID NOT COME ON UNTIL LATER INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A MALFUNCTION SOMEWHERE. I PULLED OUT MY CODE READER AND HOOKED IT TO THE OBD OUTLET ON MY CAR AND IT INDICATED, LOW TORQUE SHIFT SOLENOID CIRCUIT. I CHECKED THE INTERNET TO SEE IF ANY OTHER HONDA OWNERS HAD THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR HONDA ACCORDS, AND IT APPEARS THAT I AM NOT ALONE WITH HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT HONDA HAS HAD THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE CRAFTSMANSHIP OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS ON THE ACCORDS FROM YEAR MODELS 1998-2002. HOWEVER, SO FAR FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED ON THE WEB THEIR HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTS OR FIRES REPORTED YET. I AM URGING THE NHTSA OR SAFERCAR.GOV TO IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. ALTHOUGH MY CAR IS A 1998 MODEL, THEIR HAVE BEEN CUSTOMERS WHOM HAVE HAD THEIR VEHICLES HAVE TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH MILEAGE AS LOW AS 56000. THIS TYPE OF MILEAGE OF 56000-117000 MILES FOR A TRANSMISSION TO FAIL IS NOT NORMAL. ESPECIALLY IF THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN VERY WELL MAINTAINED, WITH MAINTENANCE RECORDS TO BACK IT UP TO DATE. ANYWAY, PLEASE INVESTIGATE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR EVEN KILLED. I DON'T WANT ANYONE OR HONDA TO SUFFER LIKE FIRESTONE TIRES DID A FEW YEARS AGO.

THIS OF COURSE LED TO A LOSS OF THROTTLE RESPONSE AND POWER STEERING, JEOPARDIZING THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.

THIS STALLING HAD THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS AS IF THE KEY HAD BEEN SWITCHED TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION (I.E. POWER WAS LOST TO THE DASH AND THE ENGINE SHUT OFF, BUT RADIO AND OTHER ACCESSORIES STAYED POWERED), INDICATING AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE.  THE ENGINE WOULD TURN OVER AND CATCH WHEN THE KEY WAS PUT IN THE \"START\" POSITION, BUT IT WOULD STALL WHEN THE KEY RETURNED TO THE \"ON\" POSITION.  RESEARCH INDICATED THAT THESE SYMPTOMS MATCHED RECALL 02V120000 EXACTLY. THIS RECALL CALLED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF A FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH. HONDA DEALER AND HONDA AMERICA BOTH SAID THE CAR HAD ALREADY BEEN SERVICED UNDER THIS RECALL AND THAT THEY WOULD ONLY HONOR THE RECALL IF IT WAS INSPECTED AT A DEALER AT OWNER EXPENSE.  WHEN THE OWNER REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH THE PROBLEM WAS RECTIFIED.  THE REPLACED PART SHOWED MELTED SOLDER (THAT HAD MELTED OFF OF THE CONTACT AND INTO THE OUTER CASING OF THE SWITCH) AND MELTED PLASTIC AT THE \"1G1\" TERMINAL OF THE IGNITION SWITCH, EXPLAINING THE SMOKE EVENT.  A MULTI-METER ALSO SHOWED INCONSISTENT CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE \"1G1\" TERMINAL AND THE WIRING HARNESS WHEN THE SWITCH WAS IN THE \"ON\" POSITION, MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR RECALL AND EXPLAINING THE STALLING.

THE SECOND STEM FAILED IN DECEMBER OF 2008, AGAIN WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IN A WATER BATH, THE STEM ONLY LEAKED WHEN IT WAS FLEXED TOWARD THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE WHEEL. THIS IS THE FLEXING THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE THAT IS APPLIED TO THE STEM AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IN THE CASE OF THE SECOND FAILURE, THE LEAKAGE WAS SO SLOW THAT THE TIRE DEFLATED AND WAS RUN AT HIGHWAY SPEED FOR AN HOUR OR MORE. THE TIRE EVENTUALLY BEGAN VIBRATING BADLY, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO SWERVE. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD ONTO THE SHOULDER. THE TIRES SIDEWALL EXHIBITED NUMEROUS BULGES AND WAS RUINED.

YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL & KEEP TURNING THE SWITCH UNTIL IT FINALLY CRANKS BACK UP. NEXT, THERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE EXTERIOR LIGHTING. THE FUSE BLOWS ABOUT  3 TIMES A WEEK & HAS TO BE REPLACED SO THAT THE HEADLIGHT & BRAKE LIGHTS WOULD WORK.

        "summary": "I OWN AND DRIVE A '98 HONDA ACCORD EX 4-CYLINDER WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN HAVING A ROUGH SHIFT IN THE 2ND GEAR FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR WHEN DRIVING THE CAR FROM STATIONARY TO MOVING. BUT THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE ON THE HIGHER GEARS. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE ON HIGHWAYS TILL FEW WEEKS AGO.         AROUND THE 15TH OF DEC 2007 I SUDDENLY STARTED TO HAVE VIBRATIONS IN THE CAR AND STRANGE HITTING NOISES CAME FROM THE ENGINE WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. THE CAR FELT DRAGGING ON THE HIGHWAY (I270S) WHICH PANICKED ME AND I HAVE TO GIVE MORE GAS TO PULL TO SAFETY. THE CAR STILL RUST, BUT I'M NOT USING IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW BECAUSE OF FEAR OF GETTING INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD CASES WITH SIMILAR TRANSMISSION ISSUES WHERE THE CAR DOWN SHIFTS TO 2ND GEAR SUDDENLY ON A HIGHWAY WITHOUT ANY WARNING, WHICH WILL LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT WITH THE CAR COMING BEHIND ME.         DEALER SAYS THAT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITH A COST OF AROUND $3200. I  REFERRED THE CASE TO AMERICAN HONDA, BUT THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THIS SAFETY ISSUE.          THE CURRENT MILEAGE ON MY CAR IS AROUND 105000 BUT THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN IT HAD AROUND 93000 MILES. THE 90000 MILE SERVICE WAS DONE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE TRANSMISSION OIL WAS CHANGED AT THAT TIME USING GENUINE HONDA MANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION OIL. I ALSO HAVE CHANGED ENGINE OIL REGULAR AND DONE ALL MAINTENANCE AS PER THE SCHEDULES PROVIDED IN THE '98 HONDA ACCORD  MANUAL. THE CAR HAD BEEN UNDER PROFESSIONAL CARE ALL THROUGH THE TIME I OWNED.       THIS TRANSMISSION RELATED ISSUE IS A REAL SAFETY ISSUE WHICH WAS ADDRESSED IN THE 2001, 2002 AND 2003 HONDA ACCORDS BY VOLUNTARY RECALLS BY HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION. HONDA HAD CHANGED THE TRANSMISSIONS ON THESE CARS TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. BUT THAT RECALL NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED TO THE 1998 MODEL CARS AS WELL BECAUSE THE ACCORD MODEL HAD BEEN COMPLETELY REDESIGNED IN 1998 WHEN, I BELIEVE, THIS PROBLEM HAD ORIGINALLY STARTED.  *TR",

IF I HAVE AN ACCIDENT WHILE DRIVING WITH MY KIDS IN THE CAR AND IT LOCKS UP,  I WILL BE MOVING ON UP TO THE NEXT STEP BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR FAULTY JUNK AND NOT RISK SOME BEING HURT OR EVEN KILLED.  *JB",

I STOPPED BY THE GAS STATION AND CHECKED THE AUTO TRANSMISSION FLUID, IT WAS FULL AND THERE WERE NO LIGHTS ON THE DASH. LATER, THE CAR WOULD ONLY GO TO 1ST AND 2ND GEAR.

I CONTACTED HONDA MOTORS, I DESCRIBE THE SITUATION TO DARCEL (4/19/04) WHO TOLD ME TO BRING IT TO THEIR LOCAL DEALE ($100). THEN, HONDA MOTORS TOOK ONE WEEK TO ASSIGN TO A PERSON WHO NEGLECTED TO CALL THE DEALER, I HAD TO CALL THE DEALER TO CALL DAVID. IN ADDITION, DAVID HUMBRAY, 800-999-1009, EXT 118128, NEGLECTED TO READ THE INTAKE INFORMATION THAT I GAVE TO DARCEL. TWO WEEKS LATER, STILL NO ACTION. DAVID FINALLY CALLED AND ASKED FOR ALL THE OIL CHANGE AND OTHER MAINTENANCE RECORDS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR USED AND PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGES MYSELF, INFORMATION I GAVE TO DARCEL DURING THE INTAKE, I DON'T HAVE ALL THE RECORDS. MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE IS A TRACK RECORD OF 98 HONDA ACCORD AUTO TRANSMISSION FAILURES WHICH SEEMS TO INDICATE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT - THIS SITE, THERE ARE 133 COMPLAINTS COMPARED TO ABOUT 8 FOR A 98 TOYOTA CAMRY. HONDA ACTUALLY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY OF 2000-2001 HONDA ACCORDS WITH AUTO TRANSMISSIONS TO 100K. I WAS JUST ASKING FOR THE SAME. BUT THE RUN AROUND THAT HONDA MOTORS GAVE ME WAS RIDICULOUS AND ADDED INSULT. I ENDED UP PAYNG $100 JUST TO FILE A COMPLAINT.     THE FINAL RESULT IS THAT I TOOK THE CAR BACK AND HAD IT REPAIRED.

I HAVE RECENTLY FOUND THIS WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW.CARTRACKERS.COM/FORUMS/LIVE/HONDA/33.HTML  AND IT HAS BECOME APPARENT TO ME THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE MODELS.  BECAUSE I CURRENTLY HAVE 87,000 MILES ON MY CAR HONDA HAS SAID THAT IT IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRENTY.  MY CAR DOES NOT DRIVE ROUGHLY AND I HAVE DRIVEN FOR MILES WITH THE LIGHT ON. IT GENERALLY STAYS ON FOR ABOUT 1,000 MILES OR SO, THEN RESETS ITSELF FOR A FEW MORE THOUSAND MILES. AFTER WORRYING ABOUT THE LIGHT REPEATED COMMING ON AFTER IT HAD RESET ITSELF I BROUGHT IT INTO MY MECHANIC AGAIN, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT WHEN AN EMISSIONS CHECK IS RAN ON THE CAR THAT NOTHING IS WRONG. SINCE I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, HAVING THIS LIGHT ON MEANS THAT MY CAR WILL FAIL A SMOG CHECK, EVEN THOUGH THE EMISSIONS ARE WELL UNDER THE LIMIT.   BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING OF AN ODBII CODE ISSUE AND OTHER EMISSIONS RELATED PROBLEMS, I FEEL COMPELLED TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  HONDA WAS FORCED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ON THEIR 95,96,AND 97 VEHICLES AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THESE PROBLEMS UNTIL THEY ARE FORCED TO.  THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED ME TO GIVE LESS IMPORTANCE TO THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, COST ME OVER $200 WITHOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM, AND HINDERS MY ABILITY TO SELL OR EVEN SMOG THE VEHICLE. RECENTLY, I WAS ADVISED TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, EVEN THOUGH THE TWO O2 SENSORS ARE NOT GIVING THE SAME OUTPUT, THUS SHOWING THAT THE CAT. IS IN FACT DOING ITS JOB.  THIS WOULD COST AT LEAST $400, $1100 AT HONDA.

I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION - NO LEAKS IN THE GARAGE, NO STRANGE SHIFTING PROBLEMS.  WE DECLINED THE SERVICE, BUT THE DEALER CALLED AND SAID OUR RE-MANUFACTURED TRANS WAS IN AND SINCE I HAD THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WOULD BE REPLACED AT NO CHARGE (INCL. RENTAL CAR).    I WAS SUSPICIOUS THAT THEY WOULD ORDER THE PART AND PUSH THE ISSUE SO STRONGLY, SO I DID SOME RESEARCH.  ON WWW.ACCORDFORUMS.COM I FOUND THAT OTHERS HAD BEEN HAVING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR.  THIS TRANSMISSION CAN SUDDENLY FAIL DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH A BEARING (IN FACT, THE SERVICE WRITE-UP STATES \"TRANS FLUID LEAK, TRANS MAY FAIL DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL BEARING GOING OUT CAUSING FLUID TO LEAK\").  I THOUGHT THIS WAS WARRANTY FRAUD BY THE DEALER, BUT APPARENTLY THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  THEY AREN'T CLEARLY EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM TO OWNERS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THE ISSUE SEEM SUSPECT.  IN FACT, WHEN WE PICKED UP OUR CAR, THE DEALER WAS EXPLAINING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM TO THE PERSON IN LINE BEFORE US (WHICH IS WHY WE GOT SUSPICIOUS).  IT SEEMS THAT HONDA HAS A PROBLEM THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL VEHICLE OWNERS ABOUT, BUT THEIR DEALERS ARE PUSHING TO FIX IT ANYWAY.  OF COURSE, THEY ORIGINALLY QUOTED US $1,600 TO $5,000 FOR THE REPAIRS.  AFTER WE TOLD THEM NO, WE WERE INFORMED IT WOULD BE COMPLETED AT NO COST TO US.  SOUNDS LIKE A STEALTH RECALL TO ME.  (THEY TOLD US IT WOULD BE FREE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE THROUGH HONDA CARE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I BELIEVE THAT EITHER.)

I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I THOUGHT HONDA'S WERE RELIABLE. THIS IS A 5 YR. OLD CAR AND ALREADY THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I'VE CALLED MY DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED EVERYTHING. THEY GAVE ME A NUMBER TO HONDA OF AMERICA TO MAKE A COMPLAINT. THEY MADE A CLAIM AND CALLED ME BACK WITH NO HELP TO ME. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS REALLY BAD ALSO, NOT MUCH HELP AND WERE RUDE. THEY STATED THAT THE WARRANTY IS OVER AND WILL NOT COVER ANYTHING. NOW MY CAR IS JUST SITTING AT THERE AND CAN;T BE DRIVEN SAFELY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS ON ALL THE GEARS AND WILL NOT DRIVE CORRECTLY. AT A STOP, THE CAR WOULD JERK BACK TO FIRST ROUGHLY AND THE WHEN I ACCELERATE, IT SLIPS ON FIRST GEAR AND THEN FINALLY CATCHES VIOLENTLY. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HONDA OVERALL. THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO BE RELIABLE CARS. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE MANY WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUES. THE PRICE FOR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION IS 3500. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BUY A NEW CAR IN 98 AND 5 YRS LATER HAVE TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. THERE IS SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON WITH THE 98-99 TRANSMISSION.

OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS I NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT HAD COME ON AND I WAS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH DELAYED AND HARD SHIFTING OF GEARS ESPECIALLY AT LOWER SPEEDS . THE ENGINE CHECK CAME UP WITH A DIAGNOSIS CODE OF P740. THE SERVICE ADVISOR ALSO DETECTED LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID AND HE RECOMMENDED THAT I FIX THE SEALS AND DRIVE IT AROUND FOR SOME TIME. EVEN AFTER THE SEALS WERE REPLACED I STILL FOUND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS LUNGING FORWARD WHENEVER IT CAME TO A STOP AND IT WOULD HAVE A TROUBLE CHANGING GEARS (ESPECIALLY THE SECOND GEAR). THOUGH THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVABLE CONDITION IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG SAFETY HAZARD AND A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A HONDA DEALER WHO RECOMMENDED THAT I REPLACE THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF ABOUT $4000. GIVEN THE LOW MILEAGE AND OTHERWISE GOOD CONDITION OF MY VEHICLE I CAN ONLY ATTRIBUTE THIS PROBLEM TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. WHEN I DID SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 98 ACCORD OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN FACING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TRANSMISSION.    I HAVE SENT A FAX TO HONDA OF AMERICA WITH A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROBLEM ABOUT A MONTH AGO BUT HAVE NOT HEARD ANY RESPONSE. I AM EXPECTING HONDA TO TAKE A GREATER RESPONSIBILITY IN UNDERSTANDING AND RECTIFYING CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS WITH SUCH SERIOUS SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED SO FAR.

THE GEAR SEEMS TO SLIP AND NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY WHEN ACCELLERATING AND DECELERATING, THIS OCCURRED MORE ESPECIALLY AT COLD START. I THEN BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY FAMILY MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD THAT THE MY TRANSMISSION NEED TO BE REBUILT, THAT I HAVE A BROKEN BEARING WHICH CAUSED THE FLUID TO LEAK AND MAKING ALL THE NOICES.

MY WIFE'S 1998 HONDA ACCORD (4 CYLINDER WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION) ROLLED AWAY FROM THE SPOT WHERE SHE HAD PARKED IT.  APPARENTLY SHE HAD LEFT THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE, BUT WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.  WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM HER ERRAND, THE CAR WAS NO LONGER IN THE PARKING SPOT WHERE SHE HAD LEFT IT.  THE CAR HAD ROLLED ABOUT 75 FEET AWAY, SOMEHOW MANAGING TO MISS SEVERAL OTHER CARS IN THE PARKING LOT.  THANKFULLY, SHE AND OUR BABY WEREN'T HALFWAY OUT THE CAR DOOR WHEN THE CAR ROLLED AWAY.  I VERIFIED THAT THE KEY CAN BE REMOVED WITH THE SHIFTER IN DRIVE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE HONDA DEALER HERE IN COLORADO SPRINGS, AND THEY INDICATED THAT THERE MAY BE A MECHANICAL PROBLEM IN THE IGNITION SWITCH, BUT THAT IT ISN'T COVERED BY A WARRANTY OR RECALL.  THEY ALSO SAID IT WOULD BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO FIX SINCE THE ELECTRICAL PART OF THE IGNITION SWITCH WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE MECHANICAL PART AND THE ELECTRICAL PART OF THE SWITCH HAS AN ANTI-THEFT FEATURE THAT READS A COMPUTER CHIP IN THE KEY AND THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO BE REPROGRAMMED (INCLUDING THE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THE DOORS...).  THE CAR HAD ABOUT 60,000 MILES ON IT WHEN WE FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM.  WE DON'T RECALL THE EXACT DATE OF WHEN IT HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS DURING THE SUMMER OF 2002 WHEN WE FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM.

FOR AMERICAN HONDA. THE MEETING TOOK PLACE ON 3/24/03 AND I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MY 2003 HYBRID AND MY 1998 ACCORD. THE PRIMARY CONCERN ABOUT THE ACCORD WAS THE RECALL OF ELECTRICAL PORTION OF THE IGNITION SWITCH. NORM REEVES HAD CLAIMED TO INSTALL A COMPLETE IGNITION SWITCH ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF AMERICAN HONDA. AFTER THE ALLEGED REPAIR, THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO STALL. I PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING: (1) I BUY THE NEW PART, (2) I WITNESS THE INSTALLATION, AND (3) I RECEIVE THE PART REMOVED. MR. CATHERINE PROMISED TO GET BACK TO ME \u001cIN A COUPLE OF DAYS.\u001d THIS NEVER HAPPENED. I BOUGHT A NEW PART FROM ANOTHER DEALER AND HAD IT INSTALLED BY AN INDEPENDENT HONDA MECHANIC ON 5/9/03. HIS OPINION WAS THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT THE PART REMOVED SHOWED WEAR UNLIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE SHORT INTERVAL. HE ALSO STATED THAT NORM REEVES COULD NOT HAVE REPLACED THE COMPLETE IGNITION, SINCE THAT TYPE OF REPAIR WOULD HAVE NECESSITATED THE RE-PROGRAMMING OF THE KEYS. FURTHER, HONDA\u0019S WRITTEN SERVICE BULLETIN 02-031 CLEARLY INSTRUCTS THE DEALER: \u001cCENTER-PUNCH A COMPLETION MARK ABOVE THE EIGHTH CHARACTER OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT VIN.\u001d NO SUCH MARK APPEARS ON MY VEHICLE. IN VIEW OF THE EVIDENCE, I NOW BELIEVE THAT HONDA HAS ENGAGED IN A FRAUDULENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECALL ORDER. TO FURTHER PROVE THIS ALLEGATION, I SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF NHTSA TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAND-WRITTEN NUMBERS ON THE ELECTRICAL SWITCH PART. I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF BOTH THE ORIGINAL PART (35130-S84-A01) AND THE REPLACEMENT PART (35130-S84-305). FURTHER, I NOTE THAT THE RAISED PLASTIC NUMBERS ON THE PARTS DIFFER BY ONE DIGIT. I BELIEVE THAT NHTSA SHOULD ASCERTAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BOTH THE RAISED PLASTIC NUMBERS AND THE HAND-WRITTEN NUMBERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NEW INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE INITIATED.  *JB",

MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WERE THE FIRST OWNERS OF THE VEHICLE, AND MY MOTHER HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS.  SHE HAD STOPPED, PUT THE CAR INTO PARK, GOT OUT TO OPEN A PARKING LOT GATE, GOT BACK IN, STEPPED ON THE BRAKE, AND TRIED TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO GEAR.  SHE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE CAR BACK INTO GEAR.  SHE FINALLY WAS ABLE TO SHIFT AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A HIGH REV AND ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY.  THIS RESULTED IN THE CAR SMASHING INTO A WALL LESS THAN 60 FEET AWAY.  LUCKILY THE AIR BAGS WORKED AND MY MOTHER & STEP-FATHER'S INJURIES WERE NOT TOO SERIOUS.  MY MOTHER'S FOOT WAS DEFINITELY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS THERE IS A LOCK OUT MECHANISM THAT PREVENTS THE CAR FROM BEING TAKEN OUT OF PARK IF THE BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT PUSHED.  THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED, BUT SHE WAS HAVING  DIFFICULTY GETTING THE HANDLE TO MOVE.  THE PROBLEM WITH IT NOT MOVING HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY, USUALLY ON A SLIGHT INCLINE, BUT THE HONDA DEALER LOOKED AT IT AND TOLD HER NOTHING WAS WRONG.  MY MOTHER IS A RETIRED SCHOOL BUS DRIVER WITH A PERFECT DRIVING RECORD, NO ACCIDENTS, AND ONLY USES ONE FOOT TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE.  NOW SHE IS AFRAID TO DRIVE AND IS WORRYING AND SECOND GUESSING HERSELF THAT SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG.  I HAVE FOUND OVER 30 SIMILAR COMPLAINTS REGARDING 1998 HONDA ACCORDS.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY OTHER HONDA'S ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  IT APPEARS THAT HONDA CONTINUES TO PLACE THE BLAME ON DRIVER ERROR, BUT WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE.  *JB",

SERVICE OCCURRED AT DEALER.    IN APRIL 2000, THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH THE EGR VALVE AS MANIFESTED BY THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT OCCURRED.  THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED BY REPLACEMENT OF THE PCV HOSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HONDA RECALL INSTRUCTIONS AND RESETTING THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT INDICATOR AT NO COST TO ME.  SERVICE OCCURRED AT DEALER.  IN OCTOBER 2000, THE THIRD OCCURRENCE OF THE EGR VALVE FAILURE OCCURRED.  THIS PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED BY CLEANING THE EGR PORT AND VALVE.  THIS WAS PERFORMED AT A COST OF $66 PLUS TAX.  SERVICE OCCURRED AT DEALER.    IN JANUARY 2001, A RELATED OCCURRENCE OF THE EGR PROBLEM OCCURRED WITH AN IDLE AIR CONTROLLER (IAC) MOTOR FAILING.  THE EGR PORT AND VALVE WERE NOT CHECKED, HOWEVER THE SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM WERE RESOLVED BY REPLACEMENT OF THE IAC MOTOR AND CLEARING OF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT INDICATOR.  THIS RESULTED IN A COST TO ME OF $226.69.  SERVICE OCCURRED AT DEALER.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, I WAS SENT A NOTICE BY AMERICAN HONDA CONCERNING THE EGR FAILURES AND EXTENDING THE WARRANTY TO 80,000 MILES.  SERVICE OCCURRED AT DEALER.  IN MAY 2002, THE FOURTH EGR PROBLEM OCCURRED WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT INDICATING A PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED TO BE THE EGR VALVE FAILURE AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER FAILURE.  THIS REPAIR HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE $800.00.  HONDA?S DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER HAS DENIED THE CLAIM, SINCE THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT 81,000 MILES, IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE OUT-OF-WARRANTY BY HONDA AND THEREFORE REPAIRS WOULD BE AT MY COST.

THE PEDAL WOULD STICK AND REQUIRE A HARD PUNCH WITH THE FOOT TO COME LOOSE.  THE DEALER CLEANED THE THROTTLE AND TOLD ME IT WAS CAUSED BY A HONDA FLOOR MAT. THIS RESOLVED THE PROBLEM AT THAT TIME.  I REMOVED THE FLOOR MAT.  ON JANUARY 16, 2002 I TOOK THE HONDA INTO THE SAME DEALERSHIP AND REPORTED MY GAS PEDAL WAS STICKING AGAIN EVEN THOUGH I USED NO FLOOR MAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  THE DEALERSHIP CLEANED THE THROTTLE AGAIN WITH A CHARGE TO ME OF  $35.18 WHICH SEEMED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  WHEN I ASKED WHY THIS ELEMENT HAD FAILED TWICE, AT FIRST I WAS TOLD IT WAS  BAD GAS, THEN THE DEALERSHIP ADMITTED 98-99 HONDA ACCORDS HAD RECURRING PROBLEMS WITH THE GAS PEDAL STICKING.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS WAS NOT DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE GAS PEDAL DID NOT NORMALLY STICK WIDE OPEN.  I GUESS DANGEROUS IS A MATTER OF OPINION.  A GAS PEDAL STUCK HALF WAY DOWN COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. WHEN I CALLED THE NATIONAL HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE, I WAS TOLD TO GET THE THROTTLE CLEANED AS PART OF MY NORMAL MAINTENANCE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF OTHER HONDA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THIS DILEMMA.  IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND HONDA SHOULD BE CORRECTING IT.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LATER MODEL HONDA ACCORDS.  I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PURCHASE A NEW PROBLEM.    ANY ASSISTANCE YOU COULD PROVIDE WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

THEN, THE CAR ACCELERATOR BEGAN SURGING BETWEEN 1000 TO 1500 RPM WHILE STILL IN THE \"PARK\" GEAR.  I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I KEPT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND KEPT IT THERE WHILE I SHIFTED THE CAR IN TO REVERSE TO BACK OUT OF A PARKING STALL.  THE CAR  WAS ACCELERATING IN REVERSE WITHOUT DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL.  THEN, WHEN I SHIFTED THE CAR INTO \"DRIVE\" , THE TRANSMISSION JUMPED IMMEDIATELY INTO 2ND GEAR AND BEGAN ACCELERATING AT 30 MPH WITHOUT DECOMPRESSION OF THE GAS PEDAL.  THIS CONTINUED ON MY ENTIRED DRIVE INTO WORK (15 MILES).  WHEN I GOT OFF WORK, I STARTED TO DRIVE HOME WHEN I NOTICES MY \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" WAS ILLUMINATED ON THE DASH BOARD.  I THEN DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THE PROBLEM.  THE PRELIMINARY CAUSE FROM THE DEALER SHIP WAS NOTED AS AN \"ELECTRICAL PROBLEM\".  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE SINCE THE ACCELERATION OF THE CAR WAS AFFECTED.  I AM WILLING TO OFFER MORE INFORMATION TO THE NTSA ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROBLEM.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP (HONDA WORLD, WESTMINSTER) AND TOLD THEM.  THEY SAID IT WAS THE MASTER CYLINDER AND AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS NO REPLACEMENT.  I WAITED ABOUT 2 MONTHS THEN FINALLY IN AUGUST '98 IT WAS REPLACED.  I LEFT FOR A TRIP TO SAN FRANCISCO AND BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY DESTINATION IT WAS ALREADY OCCURING AGAIN. WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY AND GOING UP STEEP HILLS IT BECAME DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE RELEASE IN THE CLUTCH BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SMOOTH-  IT FELT LIKE IT WAS RUBBING AGAINST SOMETHING ELSE, I HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AS SOON AS I CAME BACK.  AT THIS MOMENT THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A DEFECT AND THEY HAD NO SOLUTIONS AND THAT I COULD ONLY WAIT.  AFTER WAITING FOR AWHILE I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AND TOLD MY PROBLEM.  THEY SAID THEY WERE AWARED BUT THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME.  THEY PROMISED TO CALL ME TO KEEP ME INFORM OF THE SITUATION WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN.  IN ONE OF THE PHONE CALLS I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD A PART BUT IT WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND IT WOULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM PERMANENTLY.  AT THIS MOMENT OTHER THINGS HAVE COME OUT -  THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LOCK GIVES ME ELECTRICAL SHOCKS WHILE LOCKING AND UNLOCKING THE DOOR AND THESE ARE NOT MINOR SHOCKS.  ALSO SOMETIMES THE BRAKES SQUEAK WHILE PRESSING -  IT HAPPENED A LITTLE BIT WHEN I GOT IT BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS NEW.
