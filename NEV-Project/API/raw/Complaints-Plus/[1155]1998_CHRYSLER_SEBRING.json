THE DEALER SAID THEY FAIL \"A LOT\".  AFTER WARRANTY THE OTHER HORN FAILED.  I PAID TO REPLACE IT.  THE DEALER INDICATED THEY FAILED FREQUENTLY.  AT 9X,XXX MILES THE FUSE IN THE HORN/POWER OUTLET BLEW.  DEALER DIAGNOSED IT AS A FAILURE OF THE HORN CIRCUIT IN THE STEERING COLUMN REQUIRING REPLACEMENT OF THE AIR-BAG ASSEMBLY -- COST WITH INSTALLATION IN EXCESS OF $800.  VEHICLE HAS BEEN WITHOUT HORN AWAITING PARTS FOR MORE THAN A WEEK.      THE HORN IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND MUST BE SIMPLE AND CHEAP TO REPAIR WHEN BROKEN.  BY LINKING THE HORN CIRCUIT THROUGH THE AIRBAG, CHRYSLER HAS MADE IT NEITHER CHEAP NOR EASY.  MANY PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO OPERATE THEIR VEHICLE WITHOUT A HORN SINCE THEY WON'T HAVE THE $800+ TO MAKE WHAT SHOULD BE A FEW DOLLAR REPAIR.      SHAME ON CHRYSLER FOR MAKING THE HORN CIRCUIT THIS WAY.  SHAME ON YOU FOR TOLERATING HORN FAILURES THAT COST $800 TO REPAIR DURING THE PRIME AND USEFUL LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.",

I WAITED 3 DAYS TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T JUST ME. BUT WHAT APPEARED IN THE BEGINNING TO BE A SLIGHT GRINDING WHEN YOU GET UP TO A CERTAIN SPEED EVOLVED INTO A PROBLEM THAT WAS MUCH WORSE. A PROBLEM THAT YOU COULD HERE MORE CONSISTENTLY, EVERY TIME YOU APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES, OR JUST SOMETIMES DRIVING ALONG THE STREETS YOU COULD HEAR THE GRINDING IN THE WHEELS, LIKE SOMETHING HAD RUSTED OR GONE BAD, WHICH CAUSED THE CAR TO DRIVE HARD.
