IN SOME MODELS, THESE LED LAMPS ARE STROBED OR PULSED AT A RATE TO EFFECT A CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS BETWEEN TAILLIGHT AND BRAKE LIGHT INDICATIONS.    THE STROBING EFFECT IS VERY DISTRACTING WHEN FOLLOWING THE VEHICLE ON BUMPY ROADS OR WHEN VISUALLY SCANNING THE ROAD  WHILE DRIVING.  THE STROBING EFFECT MAY CAUSE ACCIDENTS BY DRIVERS FOLLOWING SUCH EQUIPPED VEHICLES AND FIXATING ON THE STROBING TAIL LIGHTS.      I RECOMMEND THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF FEDERAL SAFETY  REQUIREMENTS INCREASING THE STROBING RATE OF SUCH TAIL LIGHTS SUCH THAT THE VISUAL DISTRACTION CAUSED BY THE SLOW STROBE LIGHT EFFECT IS MINIMIZED.    IN PARTICULAR, I FIND SUCH LIGHTS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE BEHIND.  MY EYES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE STROBING EFFECT THAN OTHERS.  I SUSPECT I AM NOT ALONE IN THIS SENSITIVITY.  *NM",
