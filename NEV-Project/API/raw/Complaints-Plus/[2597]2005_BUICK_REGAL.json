I WAS DRIVING WITH MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS IN THE BACK.  WE WERE TERRIFIED!   WE ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO THAT CAR.  IT'S A DEATH TRAP.   I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.  THE CAR IS ONLY VALUED AT $3,000, BUT THE REPAIRS ARE ESTIMATED AT $1000.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS PROBABLY THE IGNITION SWITCH THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THERE IS A GM RECALL RIGHT NOW FOR THAT SAME PROBLEM, BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET INCLUDED THE BUICK REGALS.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE DEFECTS, BUT COULD NOT COVER THE COST OF REPAIRING IT, BECAUSE MY CAR WASN'T LISTED ON THAT RECALL YET.",

THE FRONT OF MY CAR WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED.  NONE OF MY AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  THE FIRST EMERGENCY MAN ON THE SCENE SAID SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE AIR BAGS THAT THEY HAD NOT GONE OFF WITH THE TYPE OF CRASH AND CUT THE POWER CABLES SO THEY COULD NOT GO OFF AFTER THE CRASH.  THE POLICE OFFICER TOLD ME THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG THAT THE BAGS DID NOT GO OFF WITH TYPE OF CRASH I HAD AND I SHOULD HAVE THE BAGS INVESTIGATED.  LUCKILY, I DID NOT BREAK ANY BONES BUT HAD MANY SERIOUS CONTUSIONS, CUTS, BRUISES, SCRAPES, WHIP LASH, CRACKED BREAST BONE, ETC.  MY CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER I PURCHASED IT FROM.  I WAS TOLD THAT: \"OH, THE CAR WASN'T HIT HARD ENOUGH,\" (REMEMBER THE FRONT IS SMASHED) \"IT DIDN'T HIT THE BUMPER LOW ENOUGH;\"  \"THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME THAT THEY DON'T GO OFF;\"  \"HMMM, THAT'S INTERESTING.\"  I TOLD THEM THAT I FELT THAT THEY WERE USING FALSE ADVERTISING WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR WITH ALL THE SAFETY INFORMATION OF THE AIR BAGS IF THIS \"HAPPENED ALL THE TIME.\"  NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.  THAT HAPPENED DECEMBER 6, 2007.  TODAY IS DECEMBER 29TH AND  I STILL DO NOT HAVE A REPORT FOR MY INSURANCE FROM THE DEALERSHIP ALTHOUGH WHEN THEY FIRST SAW THE CAR THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD BE TOTALED BECAUSE THE BLOCK WAS LEAKING FLUID.  MY CAR RENTAL WILL RUN OUT THURSDAY.  I CAN NOT PURCHASE A NEW CAR UNTIL I GET THINGS SETTLED WITH MY INSURANCE.  NEW CAR INCENTIVES, WHICH I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO USE TO HELP ME OUT, WILL RUN OUT JANUARY 2ND AND I WILL HAVE MISSED THAT DUE TO THE DEALERSHIP NOT GETTING A REPORT IN TO THE INSURANCE.  *TR",

I JUST BOUGHT BRAND NEW TIRES IN MAY 2007 AND APPROX ONE MONTH LATER I HEARD A BAD ROARING NOISE COMING FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE TIRES.  I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE BRAND NEW AND WOULD PROBABLY BE SOMEWHAT NOISY.  THEN THE LIGHTS STARTED COMING ON.  THE BRAKES GRIND ALSO SOME OF THE TIME AND IT SEEMS TO FEEL LIKE A CAR SLIPPING ON GRAVEL.  I TOOK THE SUV TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LEFT FRONT ABS JUMPER HARNESS IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS REPLACED AND ALSO THE HUB BEARINGS BOTH NEED REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF $1030.00.  MY WARRANTY RAN OUT JUST THIS YEAR AND THERE IS NOT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT NOT EVEN SURE IF THIS TYPE OF THING WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING GOING WRONG WITH A CAR.  I HAVEN'T HAD THIS VEHICLE VERY LONG, NOR HAVE A EVER ABUSED IT OR HAULED ANYTHING WITH IT.  I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF IT.  I READ ON A WEBSITE THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS A BUICK RENDEZVOUS REGRETS PURCHASING THIS LEMON OF A CAR AND HAVE ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT I AM HAVING.  GM WAS CALLED AND THEY WILL NOT HELP ME WITH THIS, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.
