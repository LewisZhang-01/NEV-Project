The work was done but when the car was returned the airbag warning light was on. I went back in to the service department and was told that the airbag module had failed and that the part was no longer available from Audi. An aftermarket part could be installed but I would have to pay for part and the repair. No cost estimate has been given.                I called Audi of America and they said that the Dealer told them that they didn't break it so they will not cover the cost of repair.                I have owned this car for 20 years and it is in exceptional condition. I took it to the Dealer in perfect condition for an airbag repair and got it back with an air bag warning light on and they say they didn't do it? Now I have a car without functioning airbags. Anything that you can do to help resolve this?",

BOTH HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH A FRONT SEAT THAT ROCKS BACK AND FORTH UNDER ACCELERATION AND BRAKING, THE EXTENT OF WHICH WORSENED DRAMATICALLY OVER TIME.    THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER FIXED ON MY A4 WITH THE AUDI DEALERS I CONSULTED TELLING ME THAT THE MOVEMENT WAS \"WITHIN\" SPECS. IS IT WITHIN SPEC TO ROCK ALMOST AN INCH? IT SEEMS LIKE A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN SINCE THE GREATEST STRESSES WOULD BE DURING SOME KIND OF EMERGENCY BRAKING MANUEVER.    EVENTUALLY MY S4 HAD THE SEAT-FRAME REPLACED AS THE MOVEMENT GOT TO WHERE IT APPARENTLY WAS \"OUT OF SPEC\". I ASKED FOR WHAT THE GUIDELINE WAS AND WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH A QUANTITATIVE ANSWER. I KNOW MANY OTHERS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE THAT HAVE NOT HAD ANY SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION, AND I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT THE ISSUE WILL NOT REAR IT'S HEAD WITH MY \"FIXED\" SEAT, PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO.    THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE WITH OTHER CARS I HAVE BEEN IN MADE MY HONDA, BMW, MERCEDES AND MORE SO THE \"ALL SEATS DO THIS\" ARGUMENT PRESENTED BY AUDI DOES NOT SEEM TO HOLD MUCH WATER. IF THE SEAT BRACKET AND FRAME ARE WEARING OUT OF THE MANUFACTURER'S TOLERANCES WITHIN MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP, IT SEEMS LIKE A FAULTY DESIGN WHICH CREATES A POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE SAFETY HAZARD FOR MANY PEOPLE ON THE ROAD.
