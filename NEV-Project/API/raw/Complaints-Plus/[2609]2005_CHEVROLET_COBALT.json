It never did run right anymore and then completely stopped a few days later. Also the key gets stuck in the car if the battery goes dead. I had to leave the key in with the window down because I was scared of getting locked out. When my husband was able to come and charge the battery some it released the key. It never had any issues like these until they suddenly started. These issues showed up in summer 2021. Codes mentioned general electrical failure, throttle control issues with pedal and tac module.

MY MECHANIC SAID THAT THEY WERE INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE IGNITION SWITCH SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE BAD SO SOON, THAT THE SERVICE WOULD BE DONE FREE OF CHARGE.

THAT WAS BEFORE THE RECALL WAS MADE NEWS.  ON SEPT, 11, 2015 I WAS LEAVING A STORE, AND TRIED TURNING ON THE CAR AND IT DIDN'T START. I'VE HAD BATTERY PROBLEMS BEFORE (WITH THIS VEHICLE TOO) AND JUST HAD THE BATTERY REPLACED 18 M AGO, BUT THERE WAS NO CHECK BATTERY WARNING LIGHT EARLIER OR ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE PERFORMANCE. AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE BATTERY BECAUSE THE RADIO, A/C, ETC HAD NO PROBLEM TURNING ON BUT THE ENGINE ITSELF WOULDN'T START.  AND USUALLY BATTERIES HAVE NO PROBLEM IN SUMMER WEATHER. AFTER A TOW GETTING TO THE AUTO SHOP, THEY HOOKED UP A CHARGER TO THE BATTERY, AND STARTED IT UP, AND SAID I NEEDED A NEW BATTERY!  I SAID NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, I GOT A NEW BATTERY JUST 18 MONTHS AGO. ITS PROBABLY THE IGNITION RECALL THAT IS THE OVERALL PROBLEM BECAUSE UNTIL THIS YEAR (WHEN THE DEALERSHIP FINALLY GOT ME IN) THE IGNITION WAS SLIPPING OUT OF THE OFF POSITION RANDOMLY OVER-NIGHT.  OR IT MIGHT BE THE FACT THAT THE MANUFACTURER PUT THE BATTERY IN THE TRUNK WHERE THERE'S NO AIR CIRCULATION! WHAT WAS CHEVY THINKING.  IN A RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT, I SHOULD BE ENTITLED COMPENSATION FOR THIS, I MEAN $400 FOR THE SAME PART IN A 18 MONTH SPAN BECAUSE THEY PUT A DANGEROUS PART IN THEIR CARS KNOWINGLY!  PS.

ALSO MY CAR CAN SWITCH GEARS WITHOUT HAVING TO PRESS THE BRAKE OR THE BUTTON IN THE GEARSHIFT. I CAN JUST SIMPLY PUSH THE GEARSHIFT BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT BEING IN THE CAR.

AS WE HAD JUST PURCHASED THE CAR IN JUNE FROM A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL, I CALLED GM TO SEE IF THE CAR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECALLED FOR A POWER STEERING PROBLEM.

THE CAR IDLED ERRATICALLY AND IT WOULD STALL EVERY TIME I STOPPED. NOW THE CAR STARTS AND DRIVES AWHILE BUT IF I SHUT IT OFF AND THEN START IT AGAIN THE ENGINE LIGHT STARTS BLINKING,IT BOGS DOWN AND HAVE NO POWER WHEN I ACCELERATE. I CAN SMELL GAS BUT THERE ARE NO LEAKS AND I ONLY SMELL THE GAS WHEN THE CAR STARTS TO DO THIS. I HAVE BEEN ON THE GM RECALL UPDATE WEBSITE AND HAVE READ ABOUT SIMILAR STORIES TO MINE SAYING THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE PARTS OR THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE RE-PROGRAMING.

I'M FED UP! IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN RANDOMLY AND FIX ITSELF RANDOMLY. SOMETIMES IT LASTS A COUPLE DAYS AND SOMETIMES LONGER THAN A COUPLE WEEKS.     THE PROBLEM: MY CAR WILL LOSE POWER STEERING, IT STARTS SHIFTING REALLY HARD AND THE GAUGES INSIDE GET ALL SCREWED. OCCASIONALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS IT JUST WON'T SHIFT AT ALL. IT WILL STAY IN FIRST GEAR. THE INSIDE GAUGES: THE SPEEDOMETER WILL BOUNCE ALL OVER THE PLACE, NEVER STAYING STILL. THE RADIO WILL ALSO GET LOUD AND QUIET BY ITSELF. THE POWER LOCKS WOULD FRANTICALLY GO UP AND DOWN THEMSELVES, UNTIL I TOOK OUT THE SPARK PLUG FOR THOSE.     IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE WHEN THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT, NOT LIKE CARS THAT WERE BUILT WITHOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE VERY HARD SHIFTING CANNOT BE GOOD FOR THE CAR AND IS DANGEROUS WHEN I AM DRIVING DURING WINTER MONTHS OR RAINY WEATHER. I LIVE IN MICHIGAN AND IT SNOWS A LOT.     EVEN THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP CAN'T TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG AND I HAVE PAID TO HAVE NUMEROUS PARTS REPLACED THAT HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM. I'VE READ OTHER BOARDS ONLINE WITH PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. I JUST CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP PAYING TO NOT GET THE PROBLEM FIXED. I HATE DRIVING SUCH AN UNRELIABLE CAR WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN, FOUR YEARS AND 10 MONTHS. IT HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN MY LITTLE ONE WAS A NEWBORN. FELT LIKE I WAS GIVING THE POOR BABY WHIPLASH WHEN THE CAR SWITCHED GEARS. IT'S AN AUTOMATIC SO THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.  *TR",

WENT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND STILL NO SATISFACTION I EVEN CALLED GM TO COMPLAIN SEVERAL TIMES AND I CRIED THAT I WAS GOING TO GET KILLED AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  NOW 13 + PEOPLE ARE DEAD. I HAVE MY CAR AT THE DEALER AND IT WAS A FIASCO. THEY GAVE ME BACK MY CAR WITH A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON AND SAID I SHOULD PAY FOR DIAGNOSTICS.  REALLY?? THEY HAD MY CAR I DID NOT GIVE IT TO THEM THAT WAY.  I CALLED GM AND THEY TOLD ME TO PAY FOR DIAGNOSTIC MY CAR IS TO OLD SO THEY WONT MAKE THEM DO ANYTHING. NICE REAL NICE - I GUESS I AM LUCKY TO STILL BE ALIVE TODAY - I WISH I COULD SUE THEM BUT I WORK HARD AND DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SPEND.  AGAIN THEY ARE LUCKY THEY HAVE NO PENALTY.  THEY DON'T CARE AND THEY WILL ONLY DO WHAT THEY ARE FORCED TO DO NOT WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.   THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BAILED OUT THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE AGAIN.    IN THIS WORLD ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE AND THE WEAK FAIL.   LET THEM FAIL.  *TR",

WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP ON FEB. 1, 2013 WHERE THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS DISCUSSED.

I MANAGED TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME AND PARK IT. THE STEERING WAS VERY HARD TO OPERATE, AS THE POWER STEERING WAS NOT FUNCTIONING. IF MY WIFE HAD BEEN DRIVING, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR. DURING THIS SAME INCIDENT THE ENGINE RAN EXTREMELY ROUGH AND ALMOST DIED SEVERAL TIMES. THIS CAR SIMPLY IS NOT SAFE. THE RECALL REPAIR WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL SUGGESTING THAT GENERAL MOTORS HAD ITS DEALERS PERFORM ON THE COBALT WAS NOT THE CORRECT ONE. (WAS IT THE MOST ECONOMICAL FOR G.M.?). SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE DRIVEN LESS THAN 500 MILES AND IT IS NOW FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER! WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR.   *TR",

THERE WERE VERY FEW MILES ON THE CAR WHEN THIS HAPPENED SINCE THEY PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW IN 2005. THEY TOOK THE CAR IN FOR REPAIR FOR SUCH PROBLEMS BUT WERE TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT NOTHING WRONG.  THEY SOLD THE CAR TO ME, THEIR DAUGHTER, BECAUSE THEY HAD GOTTEN TO OLD TO DRIVE AND THEY WERE TOO SCARED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM THEM IN APX. 2010 AND IT HAD APX 9000 MILES.  SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THE CAR I HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM NUMEROUS TIMES.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR INTO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE SEVERAL TIME IN CHAPEL HILL, NC.

WE RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM GM IN APRIL 2010 ON THE CAR A 2005 CHEVY  COBALT  FOR  POWER STEERING FAILURE.    THE RECALL INVOLVES REMOVING ENTIRE POWER STEERING MECHANISM BUILT BY A PARTIALLY OWNED TOYOTA FACTORY. I KNEW THE MINUTE I GOT THE NEWS THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS KILLED SO VIOLENTLY AND THAT IT DID NOT INVOLVE ANOTHER CAR THAT IT HAD TO BE MECHANICAL FAILURE.         IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE OUR DAUGHTER [XXX] BUT NOT TOO LATE TO SAVE OTHERS, I CONTACTED GM WHO SENT THREE REPRESENTATIVES  TO THE  COPARTS  SCRAP YARD IN DURYEA WHERE THE COBALT WAS STORED IN JULY TO INVESTIGATE THE CAR ACCIDENT.  A PHOTOGRAPHER, AN ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION AND A MECHANICAL ENGINEER THAT FLEW IN FROM DETROIT, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO REMOVE THE BLACK BOX, COMPUTER FROM THE CAR AND ANALYZE THE DATA. WE WENT TO THE SCRAP YARD AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE WRECKAGE THAT WAS ONCE A BEAUTIFUL RED SPORTS CAR.   ALL THE WINDOWS INCLUDING THE SUN ROOF WERE BLOWN OUT, THE COBALT HAD FLIPPED, ROLLED, EJECTING [XXX] ON TO THE HIGHWAY WHERE SHE WAS RUN OVER.  WE ARE NOT SURE IF [XXX] WAS KILLED ON IMPACT.   THE COBALT BURST INTO FLAMES MELTING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, SHIFT, UPHOLSTERY.          AT  THE  COPARTS SCRAP YARD IN DURYEA,  MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND [XXX] FATHER SAW THE CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THE COBALT   TOLD THE  STORY OF AN EXTREMELY  VIOLENT WRECK.  I WAS TOLD BY [XXX]THAT I WOULD KNOW THE RESULTS FROM THE BLACK BOX DATA THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN I TRIED TO CONTACT GM THROUGH [XXX], MISS PRICE  THAT THEY WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FAMILY. GM HAS MY PROPERTY AND THEY WILL NOT RELEASE THE DATA WITHOUT US PROVIDING PROOF THAT THE CAR WAS DEFECTIVE.

IN JANUARY 2014 I TOOK MY CAR IN TO HAVE THE ANNUAL SAFETY INSPECTION DONE.  THE INSPECTOR TOLD ME MY CAR NEEDED BRAKES ON BOTH AXLES AND FRONT ROTORS.  HE ALSO TOLD ME HE SMELLED A GASOLINE ODOR BUT COULD NOT FIND AN ACTIVE LEAK EVEN THOUGH HE TURNED THE KEY ON AND PRIMED THE FUEL SYSTEM SEVERAL TIMES.  BECAUSE IT WAS RAINING THAT DAY HE TOLD ME THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE WAS WET WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM FINDING ANY WET AREAS DUE TO A FUEL LEAK.  HE TOLD ME HE WOULD CHECK AGAIN WHEN I BROUGHT IT BACK FOR THE RE-INSPECTION.  A FEW DAYS LATER, AFTER THE BRAKE REPAIRS, THE INSPECTOR PUT MY CAR ON THE LIFT AND FOUND THE FABRIC HEAT SHIELD/SLEEVE WAS DAMP WITH GASOLINE.

ONCE I STOPPED I NOTICED THE POWER STEERING LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD HAD COME ON. I TURNED MY CAR OFF AND SIT THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE TURNED IT BACK ON AND DROVE IN TOWN WITH NO PROBLEMS THE REST OF THE NIGHT.   ON MONDAY 8/26/13 I DROVE THE CAR 30 MILES BACK TO WHERE I BOUGHT IT WITH NO PROBLEMS. THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT   HAS BEEN TRYING TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM NOW FOR 3 DAY WITH NO SUCCESS. *TT",

I WAS FORCED TO MAKE A SUDDEN EMERGENCY STOP FROM APPROX 45MPH TO 0. THE ABS SYSTEM WORKED PERFECTLY AS THE ROADS WERE WET AND I DID NOT LOSE CONTROL RESULTING FROM MY SUDDEN STOP, WITH THE ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL INSTRUMENT LITES ILLUMINATING. HOWEVER UPON QUICKLY TRYING TO RESUME TRAVEL (SINCE I WAS STRADDLING 2 LANES ON THE HIGHWAY) THE BRAKES WOULD NOT \"RELEASE\" AND FEARING A REAR END COLLISION FROM APPROACHING TRAFFIC, I SHIFTED INTO 1ST GEAR AND SIMPLY DROVE 15' TO THE SHOULDER, FIGHTING AGAINST THE \"GRIP\" OF THE BRAKES. ON THE SHOULDER, WITH THE ABS & TC LITES STILL ON, I WAS SAFELY ABLE TO REPEATEDLY SHIFT IN AND OUT OF PARK AND REPEATEDLY PUMPED THE BRAKE PEDAL UNTIL FINALLY AFTER APPROX 1MIN THEY RELEASED THEIR GRIP AND THE ABS & TC LITES TURNED OFF ALLOWING ME TO RESUME TRAVEL. I TRAVELED FOR APPROX 10 MIN AT 65MPH W/CRUISE CONTROL, WHEN SUDDENLY AN ALARM SOUNDED WITH THE ABS & TC LITES ILLUMINATING AGAIN. I TRAVELED APPROX 1MI BEFORE EXITING THE HIGHWAY TO INVESTIGATE THE ALARMS AND THEIR MEANING. I ENTERED THE OFF RAMP AT APPROX 60MPH AND ATTEMPTED TO SLOW THE VEHICLE BUT THE BRAKE PEDAL SIMPLY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR WITH NO PRESSURE! I QUICKLY REPEATED THE ACTION WITH THE SAME RESULT. FEARING A HYDRAULIC LOSS, I BEGAN PUMPING THE BRAKES WITH NO SUCCESS. SIMULTANEOUSLY I DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND HOWEVER DUE TO THE NEAR 60MPH SPEED THIS HAD NO EFFECT AS THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WILL NOT DOWNSHIFT UNTIL REACHING A SAFE RPM LEVEL FOR THAT GEAR. MY FINAL RESORT WAS USING THE PARKING BRAKE WHICH ONLY SLOWED THE CAR TO APPROX 25MPH UNTIL THEY ALSO BECAME INOPERATIVE WITH SMOKE BILLOWING FROM THE REAR WHEELS. I RAN THROUGH THE INTERSECTION, FINALLY STOPPING 1/2 WAY UP THE OPPOSING ON-RAMP, THANKFULLY DUE TO THE SLIGHT INCLINE.  *TR",

THE RECALL INVOLVES REMOVING ENTIRE POWER STEERING MECHANISM BUILT BY A PARTIALLY OWNED TOYOTA FACTORY. I KNEW THE MINUTE I GOT THE NEWS THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS KILLED SO VIOLENTLY AND THAT IT DID NOT INVOLVE ANOTHER CAR THAT IT HAD TO BE MECHANICAL FAILURE.    IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE OUR DAUGHTER [XXX] BUT NOT TOO LATE TO SAVE OTHERS, I CONTACTED GM WHO SENT THREE REPRESENTATIVES  TO THE  COPARTS  SCRAP YARD IN DURYEA WHERE THE COBALT WAS STORED IN JULY TO INVESTIGATE THE CAR ACCIDENT.  A PHOTOGRAPHER, AN ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTIONIST AND A MECHANICAL ENGINEER THAT FLEW IN FROM DETROIT, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO REMOVE THE BLACK BOX, COMPUTER FROM THE CAR AND ANALYZE THE DATA. WE WENT TO THE SCRAP YARD AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE WRECKAGE THAT WAS ONCE A BEAUTIFUL RED SPORTS CAR.   ALL THE WINDOWS INCLUDING THE SUN ROOF WERE BLOWN OUT, THE COBALT HAD FLIPPED, ROLLED, EJECTING[XXX] ON TO THE HIGHWAY WHERE SHE WAS RUN OVER.  WE ARE NOT SURE IF [XXX] WAS KILLED ON IMPACT.   THE COBALT BURST INTO FLAMES MELTING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, SHIFT, UPHOLSTERY.      AT  THE  COPARTS SCRAP YARD IN DURYEA,  MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND [XXX] FATHER SAW THE CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THE COBALT   TOLD THE  STORY OF AN EXTREMELY  VIOLENT WRECK.  I WAS TOLD BY [XXX] THAT I WOULD KNOW THE RESULTS FROM THE BLACK BOX DATA THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN I TRIED TO CONTACT GM THROUGH [XXX]THAT THEY WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FAMILY. GM HAS MY PROPERTY AND THEY WILL NOT RELEASE THE DATA WITHOUT US PROVIDING PROOF THAT THE CAR WAS DEFECTIVE.  THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE SINCE THEY TOOK THE MOST VALUABLE PIECE OF INFORMATION FROM THE CAR.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

BEFORE I COULD SLOW DOWN OR STRAIGHTEN THE CAR, MY VEHICLE HAD ROTATED ALMOST A FULL 90 DEGREES TO THE RIGHT.

A COUPLE SECONDS ELAPSED FROM WHEN THE POWER STEERING LIGHT CAME ON, TO WHEN MY CAR HIT THE GUARD RAIL. AFTER THE CAR BOUNCED OFF OF THE GUARD RAIL, IT CONTINUED TO SPIN FOR ANOTHER 270 DEGREES, AND CAME TO REST ON THE NARROW SHOULDER, PARALLEL TO THE ROAD.

THEY INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE RECALL WORK THAT THEY DID, AND MORE THEN LIKELY IT WAS AN IGNITION SWITCH THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AND THE COST FOR THAT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $500.00  I WOULD NOT PAY  FOR AN INSPECTION BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY AND THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS YOU CAN NOT TELL WHEN OR HOW IT WILL HAPPEN.

CHECK ENGINE LIGHT  TRANSMISSION GOING INTO \"LIMP MODE\"...\"SLAMMING\" INTO GEAR WHEN SHIFTING FROM PARK - OR IMPROPER SHIFTING WHILE DRIVING.

BUT I THINK IT WILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF MORE ACCIDENTS AND MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED DEATHS BEFORE IT IS TRULY DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY.

I HAD TO TOW THE VEHICLE TO A GM CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY INFORMED ME THAT I HAD TO PAY $773.81 TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN, BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  ON MARCH 3,  2010 AFTER HAVING ACCUMULATED 62,522 MILES DRIVEN ON MY VEHICLE.  I  WHILE DRIVING TO THE STORE, STARTED HAVING STEERING PROBLEMS. I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO TURN.  THEN I BECAME AWARE (WHILE WATCHING THE NEWS THAT NIGHT ) THAT A RECALL ON THE ELECTRIC STEERING MOTORS FOR 2005 CHEVY COBALTS WAS ISSUED. I CONTACTED GM CHEVROLET BUT WAS TOLD I HAD TO WAIT TO RECEIVE A RECALL LETTER ON MY VEHICLE. I INFORMED GM CHEVROLET OF MY PREVIOUS STEERING PROBLEM IN 2008, BUT WAS OFFERED LITTLE ASSISTANCE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT IF I WANTED THE VEHICLE INSPECTED I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY  REPAIRS PERFORMED.  I  WAS MADE TO WAIT A MONTH FOR A RECALL LETTER. IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK REQUIRING ME TO PAY FOR A DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR ON A VEHICLE WHICH HAS A RECALL  IS UNFAIR, CONSIDERING I HAD A PREVIOUS PROBLEM STEERING IN 2008, BEFORE A RECALL WAS ISSUED.  I RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER YESTERDAY, AND HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED TODAY, BUT I COULDN'T DRIVE THE VEHICLE FOR THE LAST MONTH, BECAUSE OF THE STEERING PROBLEM. NOW THEY ARE STATING THAT THEY WILL NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR THE ORIGINAL REPAIR THAT WAS DONE ON 10/30/2008, EVEN THOUGH ANOTHER GM DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH IN 2008 THEY REPLACED THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMNS WHICH WAS THE NORM, BUT NOW THE ARE CORRECTING THE STEERING PROBLEMS BY REPLACING THE ELECTRIC STEERING MOTOR. *TR",

I CONTACTED GM IN LATE FEBRUARY WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AND WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM IS NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE AWARE OF AND THAT MAYBE A PATCH ON ICE CAUSED THE LOSS OF CONTROL.

WHEN I FIRST TURN THE CAR ON I HAVE POWER STEERING, BUT AFTER A RANDOM MOMENT OF TIME IT CUTS OUT AND THE LIGHT ON THE DASH COMES ON.  IT WILL GO OUT IN MID TURN OR WHILE GOING STRAIGHT & BOTH FORWARD AND IN REVERSE.   MOST REPORTS I CAN FIND ABOUT THE PROBLEM SAY IT WILL COST ABOUT $2000 TO FIX AND THE PROBLEM RECURS.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET A PART TO FIX IT IS TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND SOME DEALERSHIPS ARE SAYING ITS THE STEERING COLUMN WHILE OTHERS SAY ITS A MOTOR.  I THINK ITS A SCAM FROM GM TO MAKE A PART THAT GOES OUT AND CHARGE AN ARM AND A LEG TO FIX.      THE FAILURE HAPPENS DAILY NOW.  ITS DIFFICULT TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL. IT IS UNSAFE TO TURN INTO BUSY TRAFFIC IN THE CITY AND DRIVING AROUND MOUNTAINS.  IT WAS THE CHEAPEST NEW CAR I COULD FIND AT THE TIME BECAUSE I'M POOR, SO FORKING OVER $2000.00 FOR A PART THAT WILL GO OUT AGAIN IN ANOTHER 40,000 MILES IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.       EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A LIGHT ON THE DASH TO INDICATE A POWER STEERING FAILURE,  IT DOES NOT SHOW UP ON DIAGNOSTICS.  IT IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE AND NOT MECHANICAL, SO ITS NOT UNDER WARRANTY.

SO IT APPEARS THIS CAR IS ALREADY ON IT'S SECOND MOTOR.  I HAVE NEVER TAKEN IT IN, AS THE PREVIOUS REPLACEMENT COST OVER $1000, AND COULDN'T AFFORD THAT.  THIS RECALL COULDN'T COME SOON ENOUGH, AS MY KIDS RECENTLY STARTED DRIVING IT TO SCHOOL. *TR",

THERE WAS A CLICKING NOISE THAT CAME FROM THE SHIFTER (WHERE YOU PUT IT IN PARK, REVERSE, DRIVE). THE CAR STARTED TO JERK FORWARD AT RANDOM & THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK. I PULLED OVER AS SOON AS I COULD & TURNED OFF THE CAR. AFTER LETTING IT SIT FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON & IT HAD RESET ITSELF. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND BROUGHT THE CAR TO THEM IMMEDIATELY. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 3 WEEKS & WERE UNABLE TO GET THE CAR TO ACT UP WHILE ON THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST. THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO. I HAD NUMEROUS EPISODES OVER THE NEXT 6 MONTHS INCLUDING MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN I WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 60-70 MILES ON THE FREEWAY. THEY COULD NEVER GET IT TO ACT UP DOING THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. THEY CONTACTED GMAC; THE DEALERSHIP AGREED TO FIX THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE ONE OF THE COMPUTERS THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND & JUST WRITE IT OFF SINCE BY THIS POINT THE MILEAGE WAS AT 31,000 BUT THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AT AROUND 10,000. WHEN I GOT THE CAR BACK IT WAS OCTOBER 2006. I DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE PROBLEMS UNTIL NOVEMBER 2009. I TURNED ON MY VEHICLE & IT DID THE WHOLE THING AGAIN. I TURNED MY VEHICLE OFF & CALLED A DEALERSHIP. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP & THEY KEPT IT FOR A MONTH AND A HALF. WHILE THEY HAD IT I WAS CALLING GMAC TO TRY & GET WHILE THEY HAD IT I WAS CALLING GMAC SINCE THE MILEAGE WAS AT 94,000. WHILE TALKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT FRANK PARRA DEALERSHIP & GMAC THE COMPUTER WAS NEVER REPLACED; ONLY RELOADED. TO THIS DAY THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN FIXED & IT STILL HAPPENS AT RANDOM. IT HAS ALSO STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE LOCKS. THEY LOCK AT RANDOM & TRAP ME IN THE CAR OR WILL NOT LET ME IN. THERE IS A DEFINITE ELECTRONIC ISSUE!!!! *TR",

I HAVE NOTICED A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE FAILURE:  -THERE IS AN 'OVERALL FREQUENCY' WITH WHICH POWER STEERING OUTAGES OCCUR, DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS I HAVE OBSERVED:  -TURNING OFF AND RESTARTING THE IGNITION (EVEN GOING 80MPH ON THE HIGHWAY) WILL IMMEDIATELY FIX THE ISSUE FOR A RANDOM PERIOD OF TIME, BASED IN PART ON THE CURRENT 'OVERALL FREQUENCY'.  -TIRE WEAR (RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL SURFACE CONTACT, PRESUMABLY) INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF THE FAILURE.  -WARMER TEMPERATURES SEEM TO MAKE OUTAGES MORE FREQUENT.  -'SPIRITED', HIGH-RPM TYPE DRIVING (MY CAR IS THE SUPERCHARGED MODEL) RESULTS IN MORE FREQUENT STEERING SYSTEM OUTAGES...USUALLY WITH THE SYSTEM FAILING JUST AFTER REACHING THE PEAK RPM OF A GIVEN GEAR, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CAR IS CURRENTLY TURNING.  -THE SYSTEM CAN GO DAYS AND WEEKS WITHOUT FAILING.    IT IS USUALLY POSSIBLE TO GUESS HOW SOON THE OUTAGE WILL RETURN BASED ON HOW HARD THE WHEEL IS TO TURN ONCE THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED. IF THE WHEEL IS VERY HARD TO TURN, BASED IN PART ON THE FACTORS ABOVE, THEN RESTARTING THE CAR WILL ONLY CORRECT THE ISSUE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME (SOMETIMES AS LITTLE AS 15-20 SECONDS).

IT WILL FAIL AT ANY SPEED AND IN A CURVE OR ON A STRAIGHT ROAD. I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR ABOUT FIVE WEEKS NOW. THE FIRST WEEK IT DID IT ONCE A DAY, THE SECOND WEEK IT ONLY FAILED ONCE. THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS IT WOULD FAIL ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY SECONDS TO ONE HOUR FROM STARTING THE VEHICLE. THE FIFTH WEEK I ONLY DROVE IT ONCE AND THE POWER STEERING STOPPED WORKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHARP CORNER ON A COUNTRY ROAD AND I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR PULLED OUT OF A DITCH.

AFTER THE SECOND DAY I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR. THEY SAID THAT IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE COBALT AND SAID THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN WOULD NEED REPLACED WITH A PRICE BETWEEN $1500.00 AND $2200.00. VERY PRICEY! THEN AFTER THE FIRST WEEK I SEARCHED \"CHEVY COBALT POWER STEERING\" ON THE INTERNET, AND WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT I SAW. OVER ONE HUNDRED HITS ON THE ISSUE WITH PAGE AFTER PAGE OF HORROR STORIES OF THE SAME PROBLEM WITH POWER STEERING FAILURE. SO THIS ISSUE IS HARDLY UNKNOWN.

PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS END UP LIKE THE TOYOTA RECALL AND LET PEOPLE DIE BEFORE IT GETS FIXED, BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

BEING IN THE SAME POSITION HAS 14.8% OF AMERICA, UNEMPLOYED, THERE IS NO WAY THAT I CAN CURRENTLY AFFORD THE COST OF THE REPAIR.

AS ONE WOULD EXPECT, WHEN IT WENT OUT WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH ON A STRAIGHT CITY STREET IT BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER.  MAKING IT A VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY HAZARD IF ONE HAS TO TURN QUICKLY TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER CAR, A PERSON, OR A CHILD.

AFTER ENCOUNTERING THE PROBLEM, I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY STATED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM VERY FREQUENTLY AND NOTED THAT IT INDEED WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE POWER STEERING MOTOR.  AFTER FINDING OUT HOW COMMON THIS ISSUE WAS, I RESEARCHED ONLINE TO SEE IF PERHAPS GM/CHEVROLET HAD ISSUED A SAFETY RECALL AND TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND OVER 700 COMPLAINTS (ON ONE SITE) FROM COBALT OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE DATING AS FAR BACK AS 2007 (SITE: HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/CHEVROLET-COBALT/T8FMSUQB7V2DTH5JH) , BUT NO SAFETY RECALL.  THIS ISSUE IS WELL KNOWN TO GM/CHEVROLET AND YET AND STILL NO RECALL.  THESE PARTICULAR MODELS (CHEVY COBALT LS AND OTHERS) ARE MARKETED AS GREAT CARS FOR TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS, MAKING THE POWER STEERING DEFECT ALL THE MORE DANGEROUS WHEN COMBINED WITH YOUNG DRIVERS.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS LISTED ONLINE AND THERE IS EVEN A PETITION IN PLACE TO REQUIRE GM/CHEVROLET TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.  ON BEHALF OF OWNERS OF THE EFFECTED MODELS, PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.  I MYSELF WILL BE KEEPING RECORDS OF THE COMPLAINTS POSTED ONLINE AND I ENCOURAGE OTHERS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE TO DO THE SAME. I WILL ALSO BE CONTACTING GM/CHEVROLET ABOUT THE ISSUE.  PLEASE DON'T OVERLOOK THIS.  ALL 2005 COBALT LS OWNERS ARE AT RISK.

MOST RECENTLY, IT CAME ON AND SO DID A \"POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER, MY STEERING LOCKED UP AND BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER. THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING AND IT BEING WINTER THERE WAS ICE EVERYWHERE. I FOUND MYSELF SLIDING ACROSS THE FREE WAY. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE BUT THANKFULLY MADE IT HOME. THANK GOD, NOT CHEVROLET. IT IS GOING TO COST OVER $2000 TO FIX IT OUT OF MY OWN POCKET AND I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO DO SO UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE THAT CHEVROLET WILL NOT BE RECALLING IT. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ONLINE, I AM ONE OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS EXACT PROBLEM. MANY HAVE ACTUALLY SEND PETITIONS OUT.

THIS MEANS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE SINCE CHEVROLET IS CONTINUING TO BUILD THEIR COBALTS AT SUCH A LOW STANDARD. I'M INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO A GM DEALER WHO THEN TOLD ME THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE COBALT AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME OVER 800 TO FIX AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY . I COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY THEM THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY AFTER JUST PURCHASING THE VEHICLE AND BEING A STUDENT IN SCHOOL . I THEN FOUND A MECHANIC THAT PUT THE PART IN FOR A CHEAPER PRICE BUT STILL ENDED UP COSTING ME 450.00.

I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH ON THE CHEVY COBALT AND DISCOVERED THAT POWER STEERING GOING OUT IS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG CHEVY COBALT OWNERS AND CHEVY IS FAILING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS A SAFETY MATTER BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING WILL GO OUT AT RANDOM AND CHEVY SAYS THAT IT WILL COST $800.00 JUST FOR THE PART NOT INCLUDING LABOR COST.

THIS TIME THERE IS AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT. I HAVE A 05' CHEVY COBALT THAT WHEN DRIVING RANDOMLY THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING GOES OUT. I CAN'T DRIVE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AND EVERY TIME I GET IN THE CAR IT CUTS OUT. THIS TIME I WAS BACKING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT AS I WAS COMING TO MY PARENTS MAILBOX. I WENT TO TURN AND I COULDN'T AND I HIT IT. I HAVE $500 IN DAMAGE THAT I DON'T WANT TO CLAIM TO INSURANCE BECAUSE THEN IT WILL JUST COST MORE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE MY INSURANCE WILL GO UP. I AM A FIREFIGHTER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. I SEE CAR ACCIDENTS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE OF VEHICLE PROBLEMS OR FAILURE. IS IT GOING TO TAKE ME GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, SOMEONE PULLING OUT IN FRONT OF ME, AND ME DYING?

THIS SITE HAS 335 INSTANCES OF THIS PROBLEM AS OF TODAY. GM HAS FAILED TO STEP UP AND FIX THIS. IN FACT, THEY INSIST THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN MUST BE REPLACED.

THE ENTIRE COLUMN REPLACEMENT RUNS FROM $800 TO $2000 WHEREAS THE COMPONENT ALONE HAS TO BE MUCH CHEAPER AND IS ACTUALLY SIMPLE TO REPLACE. I TRIED THE REMEDY LISTED BY WAYNE FROM ZION IL #318 ON THE FIRST WEBSITE LISTED HERE AND WHILE IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME, THERE WAS SO MUCH BLACK POWDER COMING OUT OF IT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

WHILE IT MAY BE SAFE TO DRIVE IN MANUAL STEERING, HAVING IT CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN (AS IS REPORTED IN THE POSTS) IS NOT SAFE!

STEERING BECAME ALL BUT INOPERABLE, CAR BECAME EXTREMELY HARD TO HANDLE AND CAR \"SHOOK\".  UPON STOPPING AND RESTARTING THE CAR, THINGS WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  HIS COMMENT WAS THAT IF SOME \"OLD FEEBLE PERSON\" WAS DRIVING, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.  LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS WEBSITES,  THIS IS A VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM TO CHEVROLET (GENERAL MOTORS) IN THAT THE NEW \"ELECTRIC POWER STEERING\"  IS PRONE TO FAILURE.  DOZENS (HUNDREDS) OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS AND CHEVROLET'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THAT IF THEY CAN'T FIND A \"CODE\" TO POINT TO A STEERING FAILURE, THEN THERE MUST NOT BE A PROBLEM.  CURRENTLY THE CAR HAS BEEN WITH BOEMLER CHEVROLET IN ARNOLD, MISSOURI  MONDAY 7/28 AND TODAY TUESDAY 7/29.  MONDAY AFTERNOON THEY CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT ANOTHER DAY SINCE THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO FAIL AND COULDN'T GET A \"CODE\" TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.   MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE WEBSITES, CUSTOMERS HAVE SAID THAT THE STEERING COLUMN HAD TO BE REPLACED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.   THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED OTHER CUSTOMERS TO HAVE ACCIDENTS ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ.  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO READ THEIR OWNER'S MANUAL TO GET THE PROPER PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN TO.  I REALIZE THAT COMPLAINING ON SOME WEBSITE IS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, AND THAT IT MUST BE DONE THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BY CHEVROLET (GM) BEFORE MORE PEOPLE GET HURT OR WORSE.

AS THE CAR WAS CONTINUING TO ACCELERATE I TRIED BRAKING BUT THE CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING WHILE IT WAS BRAKING AT THE SAME TIME.  I WAS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO A CAR AHEAD OF ME.  I WAS GETTING REAL CLOSE WHEN I PUT THE GEAR INTO NEUTRAL AND I TRIED BRAKING , BUT IT WAS HARD TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE CAR FINALLY SLOWED DOWN AND I MANAGED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  WHEN I WAS PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE CAR ENGINE WAS STILL RACING AND THE RPMS  WERE STILL AT 4.  I PUT THE GEAR IN PARK) AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.  I TRIED RESTARTING THE CAR, BUT INITIALLY IT WOULDN'T START.  I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THE CAR STARTED.  THIS MALFUNCTION ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM BEHIND AT 90 MPH!  I DROVE HOME AT 50-55 MPH, AFRAID TO GO FASTER THAN 55 MPH.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP/REPAIR SHOP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR, AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS ONLY THE FLOOR MAT THAT GOT CAUGHT ON THE GAS PEDAL.  AFTER, I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AFTER THE INCIDENT  I CHECKED THE FLOOR MAT, BUT IT WAS NO WHERE NEAR THE GAS PEDAL, AND WHY WOULD THE GAS PEDAL FALL INTO THE FLOOR IF THE FLOOR MAT WAS IN THE WAY?  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE  THE CAR , AND AM NOW RENTING A CAR TO COMMUTE TO AND FROM WORK.  I CALLED OTHER AUTO REPAIR SHOPS,  AND THEY INDICATED THAT I SHOULD NOT  BRING  THE CAR IN UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  THIS INCIDENT ALMOST CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT!  SO NOW I AM JUST SUPPOSE TO DRIVE IT UNTIL ANOTHER INCIDENT SIMILAR TO MY EXPERIENCE HAPPENED  AGAIN?!  *AK",

THEY TOOK OUT THE FILTER AND PUT IN AN OLD DIRTY FILTER THAT DID NOT COME FROM MY VEHICLE AS THE GUY FROM THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP IN MALDEN SAID HE FOUND IT IN THE TRASH, (HAS MADE MY DAUGHTER SICK).  #5 WHILE DRIVING THE CAR I WAS GETTING OFF OF THE HIGHWAY INTO A REST AREA AND THE CAR JUST DIED, THERE WAS NO POWER STEERING NO BRAKES ETC.  THE KEY WAS IN THE SWITCH AND IT WAS NOT OFF.  I STARTED THE CAR UP AGAIN. #6 THE ELECTRICAL DIDNT WORK, THEY FIXED THAT.   I HAVE CONTACTED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND THEY SAY THEY WILL CHECK INTO IT ETC AND CALL ME BACK, BUT THEY NEVER DO.  I WANT THEM TO FIX THE STEERING WHEEL, FIX THE CAR STALLING OUT FOR NO REASON (WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED) AND PUT IN A NEW FILTER NOT SOMEONE ELSES DIRTY FILTER.  I DON'T TRUST THE MALDEN DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP ON AT LEAST 7 OCCASIONS MOST OF WHICH THEY SAY NOTHING WRONG.  *NM",
