I didn't think anything of it and push to start it up again and it started as i continued to drive I approached another red light and as I stopped at it the car shut off and again and wouldn't start back up, as I pushed the start button I smelled smoke and I stop trying to start the car. Oil pressure gauge was reading 0 pressure and flashing red. A notification came across the dash board indicating engine failure and also was notified by my app on my cell phone that the engine failed.
