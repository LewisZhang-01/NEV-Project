        "summary": "I received a Safety Recall from Audi of America for my 2019 Audi Q5,   I am pleased that the recall is being done. However, the description of what could happen, in the Safety Recall letter,  should water enter the Gateway Module does not describe what happen to me when the Gateway Control Module got wet from liquid spilled in the backseat of my car.  The 2nd paragraph under \u201c What is the Issue \u201c states in part,  \u201c The vehicle remains steerable and the brake system is fully operable. The engine goes into emergency mode and remains in operation with reduced power. \u201c  I was driving my 2019 Audi Q5 on December 12, 2021 on a heavy traveled avenue with many traffic lights. As I went thru the second light before entering 1- 20 West the car just shut down and I mean totally stopped. No warning, nothing. The vehicle was not steerable,  The brake system did not work The engine did not start, did not go into an emergency mode and did not remain in operation with reduced power. The car was Totally Un-Operable  We called 911 for the Police and a Tow Truck. We sat in horrible traffic for more than 2 hours even with the Police. And the car could not be towed with a regular truck because the wheels were locked. Thus another tow truck had to be called so the car could be put on a flatbed truck to be taken to the Audi Dealer. I believe the Safety Notice from Audi needs to be corrected to give Notice that the Gateway Control Module when exposed to water can and has shut the entire system down and the car can become entirely inoperable as I described above. This is a very dangerous situation which may not only cause serious accidents but permanent injuries and death. I shiver now when I think of what else could have happened to us,  but for the Grace of God, because we were seconds from getting on I- 20 West when the car just stopped. I appreciate this opportunity to share this information with you. I hope it will make a positive difference for the safety of others.",

WHILE USING ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL (ACC) SET AT 75 MPH IN THE PASSING LANE ON SATURDAY AUGUST 31, 2019, THE AUDI'S TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION SYSTEM RESPONDED TO A 55 MPH SIGN SOMEWHERE OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  IT CHANGED THE ACC SETTING FROM 75 TO 55 MPH AND APPLIED THE BRAKES HARD.  I HAD TO TAP THE BRAKE PEDAL TO REGAIN CONTROL AND ACCELERATE TO AVOID A REAR-END COLLISION.  THE AUDI MANUAL STATES ON PAGE 95 THAT \"TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION DOES NOT ADAPT YOUR VEHICLE'S SPEED TO MATCH THE SPEED LIMIT!\"  HOWEVER, ON PAGE 101 THE MANUAL DESCRIBES A PREDICTIVE EFFICIENCY ASSIST SYSTEM WHICH WHEN SWITCHED ON WILL BEHAVE AS I HAVE DESCRIBED.  THIS SETTING IS FOUND WITHIN THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  IT WAS NOT POINTED OUT TO ME BY THE SELLING DEALER AND HAD BEEN APPARENTLY BEEN SWITCHED ON WHEN I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE NEW VEHICLE.  THIS FEATURE IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE SET TO OFF BY DEFAULT.  I WILL NEVER TURN IT ON!  THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS ON MY DRIVE THAT DAY WHEN OTHER VEHICLES WERE FOLLOWING ME DANGEROUSLY CLOSELY AND THIS SUDDEN DECELERATION WOULD HAVE CAUSED A REAR-END COLLISION AT HIGHWAY SPEED.",
