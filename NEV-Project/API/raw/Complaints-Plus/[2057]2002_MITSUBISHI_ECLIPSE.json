THE NIGHT I PICKED UP THE CAR, I HAD TO TRAVEL ON A FEW HIGHWAYS TO GET HOME. AS I WAS GETTING BACK ON THE HIGHWAY, I TRAVELED OVER A ROUGH SPOT IN THE ROAD, BUT I ONLY FELT THE LEFT SIDE GOING OVER IT. A LITTLE WHILE WENT BY AND AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL WAS PULLING TO ONE SIDE. I KNEW SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT BECAUSE I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBERED HOW STRAIGHT THE STEERING WAS WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR 25 MIN EARLIER. THE WHEEL STARTED VIBRATING AND I SLOWED UP, AND LOOKED FOR A SERVICE AREA ,   WHEN I PULLED OFF I LOOKED AT THE DRIVERS SIDE TIRE AND SAW IT WAS FLAT.... THEN I WENT TO CHECK THE OTHER FRONT AND IT WAS FLAT TOO!!!THESE WERE DEFINITELY BRAND NEW. I COULD UNDERSTAND THE LEFT TIRE GOING FLAT BECAUSE I WENT DOWN IN THE DIP, BUT NOT THE PASSENGER SIDE.. HOW COULD 2 BRAND NEW TIRES GO FLAT AT THE SAME TIME?? I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I CALLED 911, A POLICE MAN CAME OUT AND HE HAD A TOW TRUCK COME OUT AND FILL UP THE TIRES. I THEN FOLLOWED HIM TO THEIR GARAGE. THE TIRES HELD THE AIR, BUT I WAS NOT CONVINCED THEY WOULD HOLD. SO THE DEALER TOWED THE CAR BACK TO THEIR SHOP THE NEXT MORNING AND THOROUGHLY CHECKED IT OVER. THEY DROVE 50 MILES ON THE HIGHWAY. THE TIRES WERE FINE... THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE FLAT TIRES. AND STILL DON'T! SO AFTER READING THE OTHER MITSUBISHI REPORTS WITH SIMILAR INCIDENTS AND EVEN BLOWOUTS I'M CONVINCED THAT THIS CAR HAS DEFECTIVE RIMS AND THAT THEY MUST BEND CAUSING THEM TO DEFLATE THE TIRES. TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN,  I AM PURCHASING AFTER MARKET RIMS TO BE SURE I AM SAFE! THE RIMS ARE STOCK RIMS MADE BY MITSUBISHI! DOESN'T MITSUBISHI CARE ABOUT SAFETY???

I KNOW A LOT OF OWNERS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE V6 HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. AND SPENDING $1500 ON A CLUTCH THAT WILL WEAR OUT IN TWO YEARS IS NOT AN OPTION. MY HOPE IS THAT MITSUBISHI WOULD RECALL THIS DEFECTIVE CLUTCH AND REIMBURSE THOSE WHO HAD TO PAY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT THAT SHOULD NEVER EXIST ON A BRAND NEW CAR. PLEASE STOP THIS PROBLEM AS I KNOW ONLY MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY ON A STILL DEFECTIVE CLUTCH. MAKE THEM STOP PLEASE!  *JB",
