        "summary": "11/17/2020 Acura battery of our 2012 Acura MDX failed & was replaced under manufacturer warranty, via comp was provided.  6/29/2021 Acura battery failed again.  Dealership did not honor warranty claiming manufacturer Acura would not pay for replacement.  Dealership said I needed to contact Acura Client Relationship which I did.  ACR initially said dealership was at fault & the battery should be replaced under warranty.  I asked for a client number & was placed on 10 minute hold.  When agent returned she changed her story saying battery was not under warranty even though it had been replaced under warranty in November 2020.  Their reason was I \u2018did not pay for the battery.\u2019  This is not true as I did pay a prorate portion of the replacement in November & the original battery I purchased with the certified vehicle purchase.  The ACR agent declined to provide me a claim number.  I talked to the dealer service manager Andrew Jackson & the service tech writer Tevin Jackson.  I requested contact information for an Acura Zone or Regional Manager.  Andrew stated he would speak to general manager - Cecil Turner.  I followed up with Andrew, was told that Acura Client Relations have no record of my call (I have itemized billing & therefore proof of the call including duration) & he asked me to call back to get a claim number.  I did this & obtained a claim number which I provided to Mr. Jackson.  I followed up again & was told the Regional representative was going to try & obtain an Acura Loyalty Card.  Weeks later I checked on this again & was told they were still trying.  While the dealership is not at fault & my claim of Fraud is not directed at Acura of Little Rock or Mr. Tevin, Mr. Andrew or Mr. Cecil (even though as a 21 year customer of this dealership he has not bothered to contact me in any way) I am very dismayed that the manufacturer Acura \u2013 an American Honda com.  The repeated battery failures are a real & present safety danger.  Acura batteries are garbage.",

ALSO, JUST RECENTLY, MARCH 27TH I HAD TO ADD OIL TO MY VEHICLE AGAIN; 3/4 OF A QUART LOW ON OIL. THE VERY NEXT MORNING, I HAD ANOTHER ALERT COME ACROSS MY MESSAGE BOARD SAYING TO CHECK THE OIL LEVEL- OIL LEVEL LOW. SO I CHECKED IT AGAIN, IT SHOWED AT THE TOP OF THE HASH MARKS ON THE DIPSTICK AS IT SHOULD. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE UNLESS IT'S A MALFUNCTION OF SORTS OR A SENSOR ISSUE. I CHECK MY OIL WHEN I FILL UP MY GAS TANK. ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY SUV WAS BURNING/ USING OIL. I HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING OIL IN DUE TO A LOW OIL LEVEL LOOK ENTIRELY TOO OFTEN. I'VE HAD TO PUT OIL IN MY ENGINE AT LEAST TWICE A MONTH. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST ENOUGH TO TOP IT OFF, I'M TALKING ANYWHERE FROM 3/4 OF A QUART TO 3 QUARTS OR MORE AT TIMES. THERE ARE NO LEAKS, NO PUDDLES OR OIL SPLATTER ON THE BOTTOM OF MY TRUCK OR IN MY DRIVEWAY. MY TRUCK IS HAVING A SEVERE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM. I KNOW THERE WAS AN EXTENDED VEHICLE WARRANTY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX THIS THAT EXPIRED APRIL OF 2021-I DID NOT GET THIS VEHICLE UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF 2020. ALSO, I DID DO THE THOUSAND MILE TEST AND IT FAILED MISERABLY. NO ONE CAN TELL ME IF IT WAS FIXED OR NOT, BUT OBVIOUSLY, EITHER WAY, IT DID NOT GET FIXED OR THE FIX DID NOT WORK. IT IS A COSTLY FIX AND IT IS A MANUFACTURER FAIL, NOT MINE. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE IT CREATES ANY FUTURE PROBLEMS OR YEARS UP THE PISTONS IN MY ENGINE OR LOCKS UP.
