THESE STRAPS ARE THEN SCREWED INTO THE FLOORBOARDS BY SMALL SCREWS. IN JULY OF 2008 THIS SYSTEM FAILED AND THE TANK FELL TO THE GROUND. IT WAS REPAIRED BY A JAYCO DEALER. ON 4/ 20/09 THE SYSTEM AGAIN FAILED. LUCKILY,  NEITHER TIME WERE WE ON THE HIGHWAY OR THE RESULTS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN FATALITIES. I WOULD LIKE JAYCO TO REPAIR ALL TRAVEL TRAILERS WITH THIS SYSTEM SO WE CAN ALL REMAIN SAFE. *TR",
