They had disconnected the wire harness to the shift actuator to remedy the chance of having an accident.

IT'S NOW GOT 113K ON IT AND I HONESTLY THINK THE VEHICLE IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND NEEDS THE MANUFACTURING COMPANY TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES!

EXAMINATION SHOWED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS OKAY, THE REPAIR FACILITY FOUND THE TORQUE CONVERTER HAD BEEN STRIPPED OUT. THIS VEHICLE HAD BEEN DISPLAYING PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSFER CASE SHIFTING WITHOUT TOUCHING THE SELECTOR SWITCH. ALSO YOU COULD HEAR THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR ACTIVATING WHILE UNLOCKING THE DOORS ??? RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE ARE MANY SUCH INCIDENCES OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE. REPAIR COSTS ME $1403. BUT THE VEHICLE IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING. THERE ARE REPORTS OF PEOPLE CHANGING OUT PARTS WITH NO FIX. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE AND THE DEALER SHOULD RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED. REPAIR FACILITY SAID MY TORQUE CONVERTER HAD BEEN TOTALLY STRIPPED OUT AS A RESULT OF WHATEVER CAUSED THE PROBLEM.

I HAD QUESTIONED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP IN THE PASSED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE IN VEHICLES OF THE YEAR OF MY VEHICLE, BUT I WAS TOLD THIS ISSUE DID NOT PERTAIN TO MY VEHICLE SINCE THIS ISSUE WAS REMEDIED ON VEHICLES MADE AFTER 01 OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR.

ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT TODAY THIS DID NOT OCCUR, THEY PLACED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS ISSUE.  SO INSTEAD OF INFORMING DEALERSHIPS AND OWNERS OF THE ISSUE, THEY WOULD ONLY FIX IT IF THE OWNERS HAD THE ISSUE OF THE CHECK VALVE NOT WORKING PROPERLY.  WELL, I HAVE HAD THE ISSUE FOR ALMOST THE WHOLE TIME I'VE HAD MY VEHICLE(11/17/08), AND I'VE BROUGHT IT UP TO THE LOCAL SERVICE SHOP A FEW TIMES, AND I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THERE WAS NO LISTING OF MY VEHICLE REQUIRING THE REPAIR TO BE DONE.  THIS IS QUITE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE FOR YEARS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FILL MY GAS TANK UP COMPLETELY DUE TO FUEL COMING BACK UP THE TUBE AND SPRAYING ALL OVER MY CLOTHES.  ONCE I TALKED TO A REPRESENTATIVE WITH CHRYSLER ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE NHTSA NUMBER TODAY I WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE PART, THEY SAID THE IDENTIFIER WAS (X48).

IT THEN PROGRESSED TO AN ISSUE WITH THE REMOTE NOT WORKING TO UNLOCK ANYTHING.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO QUOTED US AT $350 + TO FIX THE REMOTE...UMMM NO.  SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN OPENING MY DOOR USING THE KEY.  LATE LAST YEAR I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT THE TIRES WOULD LOCK UP AND NOT MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARDS WHEN COMPLETING A SHARP TURN (IE: TURNING INTO THE DRIVEWAY)  THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE 4LO LIGHT FLASHING ON AND OFF ON THE DASHBOARD WHILE DRIVING.  THEN I STARTED HEARING THE TRUCK ACTUALLY ATTEMPT TO SWITCH ITSELF IN AND OUT OF AWD!  THIS CREATES A CRAZY CLICKING AND SHIFTING SOUND IN THE WHEEL WELL AREA ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  THIS OCCURS RANDOMLY WHILE I AN DRIVING AS WELL AS WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND OFF?  WE TOOK IT TO PEP BOYS WHOM COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT?  I AM CONCERNED THAT I WILL ATTEMPT TO MAKE A FAST SHARP TURN INTO TRAFFIC AND THE TIRES WILL LOCK UP LEAVING ME SCREWED.  I HAVE BEEN READING ONLINE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVING THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM AND WHENEVER ANYONE HAS THE DEALERSHIP REPLACE SOMETHING...IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.

THE 4WD LIGHT WILL COME ON AND THE VEHICLE SHIFTS INTO LOCK WITHOUT WARNING, MAKING DRIVING DIFFICULT AND BACKUPS JUMPY AND JERKY. IT WILL SHIFT BACK AND RUN PROPERLY, BUT DOES NOT STAY FUNCTIONING LONG. THERE IS A 'DRAG'' FEELING TO THE VEHICLE WHEN IT SLIPS INTO 4WD. THIS HAS MADE DRIVING THE DURANGO A CONCERN AND NEARLY TRIPLED THE AMOUNT OF GAS USED FOR SIMILAR MILEAGE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD BE A REAL SAFETY ISSUE. IT GOES INTO 4WD-LO AND THE TIRES LOCK UP. IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AT 70 MPH, THIS COULD CAUSE A SPIN OUT. WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT WAITING TO TURN LEFT THE CAR OCCASIONALLY 'SHIFTS' WITHOUT NOTICE AND THEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE TURN. WHEN EXPECTING THE CAR TO MOVE PROPERLY ON A BUSY ROAD, THIS ''SLUGGISH' RESPONSE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. PULLING OUT WITH PLENTY OF TIME TO TURN BEFORE THE LIGHT CHANGES ISN'T A GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THE TURN BEFORE THE LIGHT TURNS RED. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRUST MY VEHICLE, WHICH I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS ONLINE ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM OCCURRING FOR OTHER 2005 DURANGO OWNERS. CLEARLY, THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT UNIQUE TO MY VEHICLE. I HAVE ALSO SEEN REPORTS THAT PEOPLE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE ARE ALSO HAVING REMOTE DOOR LOCK ISSUES, WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IF THERE IS ALSO AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE.  *TR",

A CHRYSLER CASE MANAGER NAMED \"PAUL\" (1-800-763-8422 EXT. 66371) NOTIFIED ME VIA VOICE-MAIL TODAY THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY TO RESOLVE/INVESTIGATE THE MATTER.  THE CASE MANAGER IS CLEARLY AVOIDING SPEAKING TO ME BY CONTACTING ME AT MY HOME NUMBER DURING THE DAY, EVEN AFTER I LEFT HIM A MESSAGE WITH MY PRIMARY CONTACT NUMBER.  THE ISSUE:  THIS VEHICLE WAS SUBJECT TO AN INSTRUMENT CLUSTER/WIRING RECALL IN 2007.  I OBTAINED A COPY OF THE CLAIM FORM.  THE CLUSTER WAS NOT REPLACED, HOWEVER, THE WIRING WAS MODIFIED.  APPARENTLY, THIS RECALL WAS DONE DUE TO OVERHEATING ISSUES.  SO FAR, I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE.  BUT THE TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT SHOULD NOT BE ON - ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS).  CLEARLY, THE WRONG CLUSTER IS INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE AND/OR THE WIRING MODIFICATION WAS DONE INCORRECTLY AS PART OF THE RECALL.  I BELIEVE, THESE ISSUES CAME TO THE FOREFRONT WHEN THE BATTERY WAS LOW AND/OR REPLACED.  THE INTERNET/FORUMS ARE LITTERED WITH ISSUES REGARDING THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND ELECTRICAL ISSUES WITH THE DURANGOS MANUFACTURED DURING 2005-2007.  THE \"LABOR OPERATION NUMBER\" IS 08-G0-71-82 AS PART OF SAFETY RECALL G07.  I AM IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A QUOTE FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE AND FIX THE MATTER.  A ROUGH ESTIMATE IS THE COST WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1,000.  CHRYSLER IS AVOIDING TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ISSUE(S) DIRECTLY RELATED TO A MATTER SUBJECT TO A PREVIOUS RECALL.

I HAVE TO TURN THE KEY OFF AND THEN RESTART, AND I'M OKAY AGAIN. TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC IN THE LAST PART OF JULY/FIRST PART OF AUGUST LAST YEAR, AND HE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP. IT DIDN'T OCCUR AGAIN UNTIL DECEMBER, WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION- WE WERE SLOWLY GOING UP A HILL AND IT STALLED. HAD TO TURN THE KEY OFF AND THEN RE-START IT.

IT HAPPENS RANDOMLY AND WITHOUT WARNING.  NO MECHANIC CAN FIX IT YET!  THEY SAY CHANGE THE TRANSFER CASE OUT $2000, BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FIX IT... THIS IS A SEVERE HAZARD AND I WILL NOT LET ANYONE DRIVE MY TRUCK BUT ME.. I FOUND IF YOU SHUT DOWN THE CAR AND PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND PUSH THE TOWING NEUTRAL BUTTON IT SOMETIMES KICKS IT BACK IN TO THE RIGHT SETTING.  YOU WILL SEE IT SCROLL THROUGH 4WD LOW .. 4WD HIGH AND SERVICE 4WD ON THE DASH. THEN GO TO NORMAL.. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT!!!  THE FEDS NEED TO GO AFTER DODGE TO FIND THE ISSUE AND ISSUE A RECALL!!!!  I WILL SUE DODGE FOR EVERYTHING IF ANY ACCIDENT OCCURS FROM THIS.  I SHOULD SUE THEM NOW JUST FOR MY EXPENSE, LOSS OF WORK TIME AND ANXIETY!!!!  THEY NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND STOP \"LOOKING THE OTHER WAY\"!

ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINTS AND ODI'S SURVEY OF OWNERS OF VEHICLES THAT RECEIVED ENGINE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES UNDER TSB #18-013-05 SHOW THAT THESE STALLING INCIDENTS HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: - THEY OCCUR AT LOW SPEEDS, OFTEN DURING PARKING LOT OR DRIVEWAY MANEUVERS; - THEY OCCUR DURING DECELERATIONS, SUCH AS BRAKING FOR A STOP SIGN OR TRAFFIC SIGNAL; AND - THE OPERATOR IS ALMOST ALWAYS ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY RESTART THE VEHICLE.

AFTER RECEIVING THIS LETTER A FEW WEEKS AGO I INSPECTED THE QUARTER PANEL UNDERNEATH THE GAS TANK MORE CLOSELY NOTICING BUBBLING OF THE PAINT WITH CHIPPING STARTING.  PRESSING ON THE PAINT IT SOUNDED CORROSIVE LIKE RUST.  AS I BEGAN TO CHIP SOME OF THE PAINT AWAY I DISCOVERED RUST AND TWO HOLES THAT WERE COMPLETELY THROUGH.  LOOKING THROUGH THE HOLES I COULD SEE RUST BEHIND THE BODY.  AFTER REVIEWING SEVERAL CAR AND DODGE FORUMS I SEE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE SAME AREA OF THE DRIVE QUARTER PANEL.  I CAN ONLY ASSUME THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FUEL PROBLEM AND THE RUST THAT APPEARS TO HAVE COME INSIDE OUT TO THE BODY OF THE CAR.  THERE IS NO OTHER RUST ON THIS CAR AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.  I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE RECALL ON THE INLET VALVE IS STILL VALID HOWEVER RUST WOULD NOT BE.  IT CONCERNS ME THAT CHRYSLER DOESN'T FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THEIR DEFECTIVE ITEM.  HOW COULD I HAVE KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING SINCE I JUST RECEIVED NOTIFICATION I'M CONCERNED THE RUST DAMAGE IS MORE GREAT THAN I CAN ACTUALLY SEE.  OF COURSE I'M ADDITIONALLY CONCERNED WITH POSSIBLE FIRE ETC WHICH IS WHAT THE RECALL SPECIFICALLY INDICATES.  I WILL MAKE APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR OF THE FUEL INLET VALVE.I WOULD LIKE CHRYSLER TO ALSO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE THAT WAS CAUSED BY THEIR DEFECTIVE PART.

THERE IS A TSB # 14-001-09 TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM, BUT, MY VEHICLE IS NOT IN THE VIN RANGE FOR THE REPAIRS.  I FEEL IT IS MORE OF A SAFETY ISSUE AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THAN AN INCONVENIENCE.  THE DEALER STATES THAT THE FUEL TANK NEEDS REPLACED AT A COST OF OVER $800 FOR THE TANK AND 2.5 HOURS OF LABOR.  THE FUEL TANK DOES NOT TAKE THAT LONG TO REPLACE.  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO GET THESE VEHICLES REPAIRED?  OR SHOULD WE JUST CONTINUE TO SPILL RAW GASOLINE ON THE GROUND AFTER EVERY FILL UP?  IF I WERE THE ONLY PERSON HAVING THESE ISSUES I WOULD TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE NEEDED REPAIRS AND FIX IT MYSELF BUT, AS WE KNOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES WITH THE SAME ISSUE.  PLEASE CONTACT ME IF THERE IS ANY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  THANKS.  *TR",

HERE IS A VIDEO SHOWING THE ISSUE (VIDEO IS OF ANOTHER MY 2005 DODGE DURANGO WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE):    HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=B0-_9WG6DW4    BACKGROUND:   IN MARCH 2005 A RECALL WAS CONDUCTED TO REMEDY FUEL-SPIT BACK PROBLEMS CAUSED BY STUCK INLET CHECK VALVES IN THE FUEL TANK FILLER TUBES. AT THAT TIME, CHRYSLER STATED THAT THE SUPPLIER OF THE FUEL TANKS HAD IDENTIFIED AN EARLY OCTOBER 2004 MANUFACTURING CHANGE THAT SHOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, HIGHER RATES OF COMPLAINTS AND WARRANTY CLAIMS FOR THE MY 2005 DURANGO VEHICLES BUILT FROM 10/13/04 TO 11/30/04 COMPARED WITH THE REMAINING MY 2005 DURANGO VEHICLES BUILT AFTER NOVEMBER 2004 INDICATE THE SPIT BACK PROBLEM CONTINUED IN THE FIELD FOR VEHICLES BUILT FROM MID-OCTOBER THROUGH THE END OF NOVEMBER. CHRYSLER REPORTED PROCESS MODIFICATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED ON 11/24/04 TO ADDRESS SPIT BACK PROBLEMS AND BELIEVES THESE PROCESS CHANGES WOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN ALL VEHICLES BUILT AT THE ASSEMBLY PLANT AS OF 11/30/04. IN MARCH 2005 , CHRYSLER INITIATED A SAFETY RECALL OF APPROXIMATELY 24,000 MY 2005 DODGE DURANGO VEHICLES BUILT FROM 3/1/04 TO 10/12/04 (REFER TO RECALL 05V-034).   IN JANUARY 2009, THE RECALL WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 19,000 ADDITIONAL MY 2005 DODGE DURANGO VEHICLES BUILT FROM 10/13/04 THROUGH 11/30/04 (REFER TO RECALL 09V-003). ACCORDING TO MY DEALER, MY MY 2005 DODGE DURANGO WAS MANUFACTURED IN MARCH OF 2005 AND IS HAVING EXACT SAME ISSUE SPECIFIED IN THE RECALLS.  TO CORRECT SAFETY DEFECT IN MY VEHICLE, THE DEALER HAS QUOTED ME ~$1,000 TO FIX THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.  *TR",

THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I HAVE A MAJOR CONCERN WITH IS THAT THE VEHICLE STALLS DURING LOW SPEED TURNING. IF AT AN INTERSECTION AND ATTEMPTING A TURN, THE VEHICLE MAY STALL AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME MORE THAN TEN (10) TIMES IN THE EIGHT MONTHS THAT WE HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE. THIS TOO IS A MAJOR CONCERN AS IT CAN ALSO CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR WORSE TO NOT ONLY MYSELF, WIFE, YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OTHERS THAT MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT IF IT WHERE TO HAPPEN!    I HAVE REPORTED THE ISSUES TO DODGE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO ME IS TO HAVE THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED.

CONSEQUENCE: FUEL LEAKAGE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITION SOURCE CAN RESULT IN A FIRE. DODGE HAS TOLD ME THAT MY VIN NUMBER DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR A RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT IS A 2005 DODGE DURANGO WITH THE SAME SAFETY ISSUE. THEY SAY THAT THE QUALIFYING VEHICLES WERE BUILT BEFORE 10/12/2004 AND THAT MINE WAS BUILT AFTER THAT DATE. I MAINTAIN THAT THEY EITHER USED THE SAME BAD PART IN MY VEHICLE OR DID NOT PROPERLY FIX THE PROBLEM. I AM FACED WITH A $825 REPAIR BILL FOR A DESIGN/PART FLAW THAT THEY DID NOT CORRECT AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING AT THEIR EXPENSE. THIS FAULTY PART WAS REPLACED ON AUGUST 12, 2008 IN RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT 10219910 BUT HAS FAILED YET AGAIN. THE RECALL ON THE SERVICE DICUMENT WAS LISTED AS E01-410-567-1836 FROM BUSINESS CENTER/MARK WITTHOLZ. THE DEALER ONCE AGAIN HAS REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE $825 REPLACEMENT COST. PLEASE CONSIDER RULING ONCE AGAIN THAT THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION CAUSED BY AN OBVIOUSLY FLAWED PART SHOULD BE REPAIRED AT CHRYSLER'S EXPENSE. THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO TELL ME THE MAKE OF THE REPLACEMENT TANK INSTALLED ON AUGUST 12, 2008 SO I HAVE INDICATED FAILED ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUBMIT THIS COMPLAINT. *TR",

I HAVE REPORTED THIS AND CALLED CHRYSLER AND REPORTED IT AND I SUGGEST EVERYONE DO THE SAME! CALL 18009921997. IF WE CAN REPORT THIS ENOUGH, MAYBE IT WILL RAISE ATTENTION TO SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING. I AM FEARFUL TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK AND EVEN MORE FEARFUL FOR MY KIDS TO BE IN IT AND IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE OUR FAMILY CAR. IF I GET IN A WRECK I WILL GET A LAWYER AND I WILL SUE THEM. *TR",

I CHECKED FOR RECALLS REGARDING THIS AND FOUND THAT CHRYSLER HAS ONE FOR THIS, WHICH IS H45 OR 09V003000.  I NOTIFIED CHRYSLER AT THE NUMBER GIVEN (REF #18975878) AND WAS ADVISED THAT EVENTHOUGH MY VEHICLE WAS NOT IN THE RECALL CAMPAIGN, I COULD GO TO A CERTIFIED DEALER AND PAY THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND IF THEY FOUND THAT I HAD THE DEFECT DESCRIBED, THEY WOULD COVER THE REPAIR.  I WENT TO HOLDEN DODGE IN DOVER, DE AND THEY FOUND THE VEHICLE TO HAVE THE EXACT PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL WHERE MY INLET CHECK VALVE STICKS OPEN. WHEN THEY CONTACTED CHRYSLER, HOLDEN DODGE WAS ADVISED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WAS THE 3RD OWNER AND THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE REPAIR.  IT SHOULD NOT MATTER IF I WAS THE 50TH OWNER, IT IS THEIR DEFECT!! I WAS ADVISED THAT THIS RECALL WAS FOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED IN OCTOBER 2004 AND MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED IN JANUARY 2005.  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CORRECTED THIS MALFUNCTION IN 3 MONTHS SINCE I AM EXPERIENCING THIS DEFECT.  I WANT CHRYSLER TO HONOR THE TANK REPLACEMENT UNDER WARRANTY SINCE A CERTIFIED DEALER HAS CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS MY PROBLEM. I OAID THE $80.00 DIAGNOSTIC FEE AS ADVISED AND CHRYSLER DID NOT HOLD TO THEIR PROMISE WHEN I ORIGINALLY CALLED.   WAS GIVEN A QUOTE OF $669.00 TO REPLACE HE TANK, WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD.  SO RIGHT NOW, I DO NOT FILL THE TANK WITH GAS.  PLEASE HELP ME TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AND HAVE CHRYSLER HONOR THEIR DEFECT!!!! *TR",

I SCHEDULED THE APPOINT FOR THE RECALL AND FOR ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE. I INVESTIGATED THE RECALLS, AND FOUND 2: A POTENTIAL INSTRUMENT PANEL FAILURE, AND A PROBLEM WITH FUEL SPILLING OUT OF THE INLET DURING REFUELING.   I SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT, AND OFF THE DURANGO ON 2-26-08. THE NEXT DAY, MIKE (FROM OUR DEALER) CALLED AND SAID THAT THE RECALL HAD ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED. HE STATED THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER SOMETIMES MADE MISTAKES LIKE THIS WITH RECALLS. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE ONLY RECALL THE DURANGO WAS ELIGIBLE FOR WAS FOR THE ISSUE WITH THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND THE THE RECALL FOR THE ISSUE WITH THE INLET VALVE DID NOT APPLY TO VEHICLES MADE AFTER 10-12-2004 - OURS WAS MADE 10-15-05.  I EXPLAINED TO MIKE THAT THE DURANGO HAD THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE RECALL. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, MY WIFE WAS DOUSED WITH GAS AS SHE FILLED THE DURANGO - GAS ESCAPES FREQUENTLY WHEN FILLING UP. MIKE SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO, EXCEPT PERFORM THE REPAIR - THE EXACT SAME THING THE RECALL WAS FOR, BUT AT MY EXPENSE, AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT DAIMLER CHYRYSLER TO SEE IF THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME.  I CONTACTED DAIMLERCHRYSLER TWICE AFTER I FOUND DOCUMENTATION ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE, FROM DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO NHTSA, STATING THAT ALL DURANGOS FROM VIN 5F500001 TO 5F535219 WOULD BE RECALLED. THE VIN ON MY DURANGO IS 5F529730 - WELL WITHIN THE RECALL RANGE. THE LETTER I FOUND ON NHTSA'S WEBSITE (DATED 3-18-2005) FROM STEPHAN J SPETH (DIRECTOR, VEHICLE COMPLIANCE) TO MS. KATHLEEN C. DEMETER (ACTING ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, SAFETY ASSURANCE) AT NHTSA, INDICATING A \"DATE RANGE\" FOR AFFECTED VEHICLES. DAIMLER CHRYLSER ASSIGNED A REFERENCE NUMBER (17265274), BUT STATED THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PERFORM THE RECALL.

MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED, I HAD NO BRAKES, NO ELECTRICAL, NOTHING. THE ENTIRE CAR SHUT OFF. I HAD NO CONTROL OF ANYTHING. I WENT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANES. LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THOSE LANES. I MANAGED TO GET THE CAR TO STOP AFTER PULLING INTO A PARKING LOT. AFTER A FEW MINUTES THE CAR STARTED AGAIN. I WAS ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME SO I TRIED TO DRIVE BACK HOME. CAR STALLED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER. I PARKED IT. IT WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED THE IGNITION AND FLASHED THE COMPUTER. THE DAY THEY GAVE IT BACK TO ME IT HAPPENED AGAIN. RIGHT AWAY IT WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY HAVE HAD IT EVER SINCE. IT'S BEEN SEVEN DAYS AND NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL. I AM HESITANT TO TAKE THIS CAR BACK OR BE PUTTING MY CHILDREN IN IT AGAIN. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS. I WAS LUCKY THIS TIME AND DO NOT PLAN TO TRY MY LUCK AGAIN. PEOPLE COULD DIE FROM THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. APPARENTLY I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE.  *NM",

THIS IS A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATION IN THAT AT LEAST HALF A GALLON OF FUEL THAT SPIILLS OUT THAT COULD IGNITE AND SPREAD TO THE FUEL TANK AND CAUSE AN EXPLOSION. FORTUNEATELY IT IS WINTER NOW, BUT IN THE SUMMER THE CHANCES OF FIRE AND EXPLOSION ARE MORE LIKELY. THE CAR IS A NEW MODEL FOR DODGE AND I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIALTEY. I PLAN ON CONTACTING THE DODGE TO IDENTIFY THE PROPLEM WITH THEM. I'M SURE THEY WILL NOT SHARE WITH ME IF OTHER DURANGO OWNERS ARE HAVING A SIMILAR PROBLEM.*AK",
