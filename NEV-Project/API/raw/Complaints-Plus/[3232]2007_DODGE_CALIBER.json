The receptionist came into the waiting room to inform me that my vehicle was dangerous to drive.  The engine cradle had rotted out.  The manager had asked her to tell me:  \"If you hit a big bump, your engine could fall out.\"  She showed me a picture of the area in question.  I asked what I was supposed to be looking for and was shown where the cradle was supposed to be.  A post-it note was on the picture saying that the manager \"will do some pricing\".  The invoice states:  \"We question the structural integrity of it being able to hold up much longer.\"  When I did not hear anything for a few weeks, I called in and was told that it had not been done but the manager would get right on it.  I had asked the manager how this could have been missed during all the years I had been bringing it in for any kind of maintenance and was told:  \"It probably looks worse that what it should because I poked it with a screwdriver a few times to see how bad it was.\"  Invoice total:  $1884.20.  I have since spoken with a general manager for Magna Corporation who produced the cradle for the Caliber.  They were aware of the design flaw of the cradle that did not allow for drainage of water/road chemicals from the cradle.  A lawsuit was filed by Magna against Dodge which Magna won.  The particulars of the lawsuit were not made known to me other than Magna charges $42 for the cradle, but I was billed $859.  I have found numerous customer complaints online over the corrosion of the cradle in other Dodge model years as well.  The 2007 Caliber seems to have more overall customer complaints that all othe model years combined.",

Vehicle did not move after that for almost 2 months until the parts could be replaced. Stalantis received a claim from me in regards to the issues however they were not willing to proceed any further with any actions. These claims need to be looked into because there are quite a few instances that are posted online with videos and or user blogs that are describing similar incidents with Dodge calibers. Someone is going to get hurt from this rust issue. Not everyone is mechanically inclined and it will only take one incident and someone will get hurt or maybe even kill not to mention other people that are on the road who are innocently driving and other vehicles. Chrysler new this wasn't issue and has failed to take care of it completely. I have spent quite a bit of money to replace these parts as to make my car safe for my child and myself and my girlfriend. There needs to be a final recall just like there was and still is on airbags. You have a dangerous problem that needs to be taken care of. Please Force stalantis to recall and or compensate all owners who have these vehicles. I have included three pictures of just the front subframe. I have kept the subframe in the front and the rear and the trailing arms. If pictures are needed please let me know.",

CAR IN LEFT LANE HIT MY FRONT END WHICH LED TO A HEAD ON COLLISION. THE ROADWAYS WAS CLEAR AND WEATHER CONDITIONS DRY.

THE MECHANIC (H&J AUTO REPAIR MILTON, WI), WOULD NOT LET ME DRIVE THE CAR HOME.

IT IS ESSENTIALLY A \"CHECK VALVE\" WHICH PREVENTS FUEL FROM SPILLING BACK OUT OF THE TANK IN THE EVENT OF A ROLLOVER ACCIDENT.  IF THIS ROLLOVER VALVE IS STUCK \"PARTIALLY CLOSED\" DURING FILLING, THEN IT COULD ALSO BE STUCK \"PARTIALLY OPEN\" AND ALLOW FUEL TO DANGEROUSLY SPILL BACKWARD THROUGH THE FILLER NECK IN THE EVENT OF A ROLLOVER ACCIDENT.    I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO AN AUTHORIZED DODGE DEALER TO INVESTIGATE THE ABOVE.  THEY CHECKED INTO THEIR DATABASE AND FOUND THIS DEFECTIVE PART TO HAVE CAUSED A RECALL ON SOME OTHER 2007 DODGE VEHICLES (AVENGER, DAKOTA AND I BELIEVE RAM'S) BUT THE FREQUENCY WAS NOT JUSTIFIED FOR DODGE CALIBERS.

I TURNED ON THE HEADLIGHTS AND THEY BOTH ILLUMINATED.  A COUPLE HOURS LATER, I WENT TO LEAVE AGAIN BUT AFTER TURNING ON THE HEADLIGHTS NEITHER OF THEM ILLUMINATED.  AFTER SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THAT IT'S THE TIPM FAILING IN THE VEHICLE.  I'VE ALSO READ THAT CHRYSLER INSTALLED THE FUSE BOX UNDER THE HOOD WHERE IT'S EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND THIS IS POSSIBLY WHY SO MANY CALIBER OWNERS ARE SEEING THIS ISSUE.  I LOOKED THROUGH THE LAST 50 COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA AND 20 OF THEM ARE FOR THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  IF 40% OF THE COMPLAINTS ON A VEHICLE ARE FOR THE SAME ISSUE, SHOULDN'T CHRYSLER DO THE RIGHT THING AND OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT?

WE CHANGE THE OIL BEFORE IT IS DUE AND REGULARLY SCHEDULE CHECK UPS TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO MAJOR ISSUES. NOW WE ARE TAKING OUR CAR IN THIS WEEKEND TO GET THE TIE RODS DONE AND TO SEE IF ALSO CONTROL ARMS AND BALL JOINTS NEED TO BE REPLACED. FOR TIE RODS TO GO OUT WHILE DRIVING IS A SERIOUS ISSUE.

THE FIRST ISSUE INVOLVED THE STEERING AND WAS TOLD THAT BOTH FRONT STRUTS, CONTROL ARMS AND OUTER TIE ROD ENDS WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENT - AT 6K MILES! THIS REPAIR ALSO INVOLVED REPLACING THE REAR BRAKE SHOES. THE STEERING WAS MAKING A GRINDING NOISE WHEN PARKING OR PARALLEL PARKING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. I HAD THIS REPAIR PERFORMED USING PARTS I PURCHASED MYSELF AND A LOCAL MECHANIC I FOUND ON CRAIGSLIST WHO WAS WILLING TO DO THE LABOR FOR ABOUT $300 INCLUDING THE NECESSARY 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT. THE PARTS COST ABOUT $500 OR SO.    ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE I BROUGHT THE CAR HOME HAS BEEN THIS RATTLE AND CLUNK IN THE REAR SUSPENSION. IT SEEMS THAT NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT WHAT THE EXACT PROBLEM MAY BE. I REPLACED THE REAR SHOCKS MYSELF THINKING THAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM, BUT IT STILL MAKES THIS ANNOYING NOISE. THE CAR HAS NO REAR SWAY BAR. I WAS TOLD IT'S NOT A CONTROL ISSUE AND HAVE \"LIVED WITH IT\" AS ANNOYING AS IT IS ALL THESE YEARS. IT SEEMS IT HAS NOT AFFECTED THE VEHICLE CONTROL, BUT IT'S A NUISSANCE. I'M GETTING READY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM MYSELF AS IT MUST BE THE REAR CONTROL ARMS OR TOE LINKS. THIS ALWAYS OCCURS WHILE DRIVING OVER AN UNEVEN SURFACE LIKE A GRAVEL DRIVEWAY OR A VERY BUMPY ROAD.    IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THE FRONT TIE RODS APPEAR TO BE IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT YET AGAIN AS I INPSECTED THESE MYSELF AND NOTED THERES NO BOOT ON THEM AND GETTING SOME STEERING NOISES AGAIN, INCLUDING A CLUNK WHILE STEERING OR BRAKING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. MIGHT NEED ANOTHER SET OF CONTROL ARMS (NOT SURE YET)    REALLY FEEL AS IF DODGE SHOULD ADDRESS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS A DEFECT AND PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS - AS I'VE BEEN READING HERE AND ON PLENTY OF CALIBER FORUMS I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S HAD THESE EXACT PROBLEMS.  *TR",

MY 2 CHILDREN SIT IN THE BACK OF THIS CAR AND NOW KNOWING THAT IT COULD'VE STARTED FIRE WITH THEM IN IT, REALLY PISSES ME OFF AND THERE'S NOTHING THEY ARE GONNA DO ABOUT IT.  REALLY????  I WILL BE GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP AND SHOWING THEM WHAT HAPPENED TO FUEL PUMP CONNECTORS AND ASKING WHAT THEY ARE GONNA DO ABOUT IT.  IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TAKING THE FUEL PUMP OUT AND BURNING IT UP. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.  *TR",

UPON REMOVAL OF THE SUBFRAME A FIST SIZED HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE TOP OF THE SUBFRAME AND THERE WERE ALSO CRACKS RADIATING BACK THROUGH MORE OF THE FRAME. LOOKING AT THE REMOVED ITEM, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE DEGRADATION WAS SO SEVERE THAT HITTING A BAD ENOUGH BUMP OR HOLE COULD VERY POSSIBLY CAUSE LOSS OF INTEGRITY IN THE SUSPENSION, STEERING OR ENGINE MOUNTING.  ALL IN ALL, THIS SITUATION LOOKED EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS. AND CONSIDERING THAT A VISUAL INSPECTION FROM UNDERNEATH, AS DURING AN OIL CHANGE, ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN PERFORMED RECENTLY, DID NOT SHOW THE DAMAGE, I WOULD SAY THIS IS A VERY BAD SITUATION. IN RESEARCHING THIS CONDITION ONLINE, IT SOUNDS POSSIBLE THAT THE AIR CONDITION DRIPPING COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CASES TO BE SEEN.  I FEEL THAT WE ARE VERY LUCKY THERE WAS NO MAJOR INCIDENT DUE TO THIS CONDITION. THIS VEHICLE, WHILE A 2007 HAS AN IN SERVICE DATE OF FEBRUARY 2008. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND THIS SITUATION SERIOUS ENOUGH TO REVIEW, AND I HAVE TAKEN A SERIES OF PICTURES WHICH WILL HELP TO DOCUMENT THE PROBLEM.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN REVIEWING THIS FOR US.  *TR",

HE WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE ANY OEM PARTS FROM DODGE OR ANY AFTERMARKET REPLACEMENTS. WHEN HE CONTACTED AFTER MARKET SUPPLIERS, HE WAS TOLD IT IS TOO SOON FOR THIS PART TO NEED REPLACED AND SUPPLIERS WERE NOT YET MANUFACTURING AFTERMARKET REPLACEMENT PARTS. WAITED OVER 2 WEEKS FOR DODGE TO SUPPLY PARTS.  THANK GOD THE COIL SPRING DID NOT BREAK WHILE MOVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY! IT SURELY WOULD HAVE CAUSED A LOSS OF CONTROL AND A SERIOUS ACCIDENT! THE MANAGER SAYS HE HAS BEEN SEEING A HIGH INCIDENCE OF THIS TYPE OF PREMATURE FAILURE AND WOULD EXPECT DODGE TO ISSUE A RECALL SOON DUE TO THE OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS. EVIDENTLY, THERE IS AN ABNORMALLY HIGH DEMAND FOR THE REPLACEMENT SPRINGS WHICH IS PROBABLY THE REASON FOR THE LACK OF AVAILABLE PARTS.  THE SUPPLY IS BEING CONSTANTLY DEPLETED BY BREAKDOWNS. I WOULD GUESS MANY ACCIDENTS ARE BEING CAUSED BY THIS COIL SPRING FAILURE AND GO UNDOCUMENTED AS THE CAUSE BECAUSE THE COIL SPRING DAMAGE IS ASSUMED TO BE A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT AND NOT THE CAUSE!

I TOOK THE CAR TO HAVE THE TIRES REPLACED AT THE COST OF $600, BUT WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN OF THE CAR THAT THE TIRES WORE THE WAY THEY DID. I TOOK THE CAR, WITH NEW TIRES TO THE SHOP FOR AN ALIGNMENT AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE CAR WAS BUILT TO ONLY BE ALIGNED IN TWO DIRECTIONS AND SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ALIGNED IN THREE WAYS.THE CAR ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH STEERING WHEN THERE WAS A SEAM IN THE PAVEMENT ON THE ROADWAY; THE FRONT END WOULD ?FOLLOW?

THE TWO WAYS I HAVE SEEN TO FIX THIS IS TO BUY A NEW TIPM FOR $500-$800 DOLLARS, NOT INSTALLED, OR REWIRE IT TO THE PASSENGER LIGHT WHICH MAY CAUSE A FIRE. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! TO RELY ON A $500-$800 PART TO MAKE SURE A HEADLIGHT WORKS? DODGE NEEDS TO BE FORCED TO RECALL THE PART OR PROVIDE OWNERS AVAILABLE OPTIONS AT CHEAPER RATES! THIS IS VERY POOR AND I HOPE THAT NHTSA WILL ASSISTS THE 1,000'S OF OWNERS WHO ARE EXPERINCING THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU!",

HAS NO CLUE WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT & NO CLUE ON THE COST ( THIS HAS ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM ON 2007 DODGE CALIBERS) THIS HAS ALL HAPPENED WITHIN THE LAST 3 MONTHS AND MY CAR HAS ABOUT 86000 TO 87000 MI ON IT! I?M FED UP THIS CAR IS FALLING APART. AS I HAVE READ DODGE KNOWS OF THESE ISSUES & HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT I HAVE ALSO CALLED AND MADE MY COMPLAINT NO CALL BACK YET..ANY OPEN LAWSUITS ON THIS?  I WOULD EVEN BE HAPPY IF DODGE WOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THESE ISSUES AS OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE WELL DOCUMENTED KNOWN ISSUES. I HAVE SPENT WAY TO MUCH ON THIS CAR IN 3 MONTHS AND @ 7 MONTHS PREGNANT WITH A 6 YEAR OLD I NEED A SAFE RELIABLE CAR!  *TR",

WITHIN MY FIRST TWO WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP THE STARTER WAS STUCK ENGAGED AS I DROVE AND CAUGHT FIRE.  THIS I REPLACED KNOWING WITH AGE, STARTERS AND ALTERNATORS DIE.  A MONTH AFTER SERVICING THE STARTER, I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT A SPEED OF 67MPH IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN A LIGHTENING BOLT (ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL SENSOR LIGHT) FLASHED AND THE CAR JERKED AS IF IT WERE TO STALL.  I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THAT IT PROBABLY WAS THE THROTTLE BODY AND THAT I MIGHT AS WELL DRIVE THE CAR FOR A BIT BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS NOT STAYING LIT.  EVERY SINCE THEN THE LIGHT HAS FLASHED ON ATLEAST ONCE A MONTH WITH THE CAR VIOLENTLY JERKING AS TO STALL.  I STARTED THE CAR LAST WEEK AND THE IDLE WAS MISERABLE SO FIGURED THE THROTTLE BODY HAD GONE. TOOK THE CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO READ CODES ON THE PC. CODE WAS FOR THE THROTTLE BODY.  THE THROTTLE BODY WAS REPLACED BY A CERTIFIED DEALERSHIP MECHANIC.  WITHIN 30 MILES AND 30MINS AFTER LEAVING THE GARAGE THE CAR WAS  JERKING TO STALL AS BEFORE BUT THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON.  SEEM TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM CONSIDERING STALL ON INTERSTATE AT THOSE SPEEDS AND HIT BY A SEMI WOULD CAUSE INSTANT DEATH.  THE VALUE OF MY CAR IS NO LONGER HIGH BUT YOU CAN GUARANTEE THE LOAN AND PAYMENTS ARE. I AM A PRESCHOOL TEACHER AND MAKE A VERY SMALL INCOME.  TOOK CAR INSTANTLY BACK TO DEALERSHIP BUT I KNOW THEY WILL FIND NOTHING, CHARGE TO MUCH, AND SEND ME ON MY WAY WITH A DEATH SENTENCE.  SEEMS AS THOUGH DODGE/CHRYSLER HAS DECIDED THAT AS LONG AS NO DEATHS IT IS OK TO CARRY ON WITH THIS REFUSAL TO ADMIT THAT THEY MADE A BAD PRODUCT.  HOW ABOUT ROBBING! ALL I WANT IS MY CAR FIXED BUT OF COURSE THEY WILL NOT ADMIT ANYTHING.  SUPPOSE I WILL HAVE TO CALL THE NEWS, FAX THE CEO'S, AND DIE . *TR",

USUALLY I AM AT A STOP AND THEN WHEN I ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE , THE CAR DIES.  IT STARTS RIGHT BACK UP BUT,  BECAUSE I LOSE POWER, I'M FORCED TO PULL OVER IN TRAFFIC UNEXPECTEDLY.  THIS IS A DEFINITE SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME.  THE VEHICLE WILL BE AT THE DODGE DEALERSHIP TOMORROW SO THAT THEIR MECHANICS CAN LOOK IT OVER.  I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH CHRYSLER AT 800-853-1403 AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AS A PROBLEM/TREND. *TR",

THE TIRE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD SEEN NUMEROUS CASES OF THIS WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF CAR.  LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND BALL JOINTS ARE NOT NORMAL WEAR ITEMS, THEY ARE STEERING COMPONENTS THAT SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN A SET OF TIRES.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ON THE INTERNET BY GOOGLING  DODGE CALIBER + BALL JOINTS, I FOUND MANY OTHER CALIBER OWNERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE.  DODGE HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN ON THIS VERY UNSAFE ISSUE. TOYOTA WAS SUBJECTED TO GOVERNMENT HEARINGS, MADE MAJOR NEWS HEADLINES AND FINED HEAVILY DUE TO THROTTLE STICKING.  DRIVERS HAD THE ABILITY TO REACT  BY PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL OR SHUTTING OFF THE CAR BUT WITH THIS  STEERING ISSUE, YOU MAY NOT  HAVE THE ABILITY TO STEER THE AUTOMOBILE AT ALL.  MY RESEARCH SHOWS CHRYSLER HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO FIX THIS ISSUE, RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS YOU CAN ONLY GET REPLACEMENT PARTS ONLY FROM AN  AUTHORIZED CHRYSLER DEALER AND WHEN YOU PAY CHRYSLER TO FIX IT, THEY ARE USING THE SAME REPLACEMENT PARTS THAT FAILED WITHOUT WARNING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  THE CAR MUST BE JACKED UP AND TIRES REMOVED TO EVALUATE THE BALL JOINTS.   THE BALL JOINTS FAIL SO BADLY IT DESTROYS THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS THEY ARE MOUNTED IN.  THIS CANNOT BE CHECKED ANY OTHER WAY.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE FOR ME AND  MY FAMILY AND EVERYONE ON THE ROAD WITH THOUSANDS OF THESE CARS ON THE ROAD AS WELL.

ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO(CAR NOW HAS 46,000 MILES AND OUT OF WARRANTY) I GOT STOPPED BY A POLICE OFFICER. HE INFORMED ME THAT MY REAR BRAKE LIGHTS WEREN'T WORKING(THIRD BRAKE LIGHT WORKED OK). I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT IT FROM SO THEY COULD DIAGNOSE IT. I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED SOME KIND OF SOFTWARE UPGRADE AND WAS GOING TO COST ME BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NO LONGER IN WARRANTY. I LOST MY JOB SHORTLY AFTER BUYING THE CAR AND TOLD THE DEALERSHIP I COULDN\\'T AFFORD TO PAY. THEY DID SOME TYPE OF RESET(FREE OF CHARGE)AND SAID IT MIGHT NOT LAST. THE OTHER DAY I GOT STOPPED AGAIN, FINDING OUT MY BRAKE LIGHTS WEREN'T WORKING AGAIN. I'M STILL NOT WORKING SO THINGS ARE EVEN TIGHTER THAN BEFORE. I  CALLED DODGE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD HELP ME OUT. HE SAID HE TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM THEY WOULD HAVE TO DIAGNOSE IT. BECAUSE IT WAS AN   ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THEY MIGHT NEED THE CAR FOR A COUPLE DAYS AND THE CHARGES COULD BE QUITE HIGH. THE GUY AT DODGE SAID THE BEST HE COULD DO IS PAY HALF OF THE REPAIR. I TOLD HIM HALF WASN'T GOING TO HELP SO I GUESS MY ONLY OPTION WAS TO DRIVE IT LIKE IT WAS. MY INTENSION WAS TO KEEP THE CAR FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND BUY A NEW DODGE BUT IF THIS IS THE WAY THEY OPERATE I GUESS I'LL BUY ANOTHER BRAND. HE SAID HE WOULD KEEP ON RECORD IN CASE I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT SPLITTING THE CHARGES. I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD KEEP IT ON RECORD SO WHEN I GET REAR ENDED I CAN SAY I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'M STILL OUT OF WORK AND STILL DRIVING IT WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME, BUT WHAT CAN I DO? *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF THE ROAD. MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FROM WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR AND AFTER SPEAKING TO THEM DECIDED TO DRIVE MY CAR THERE. AS I PULLED FORWARD ANOTHER LIGHT POPPED ON. THIS TIME IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION OVER TEMPERATURE LIGHT. (I WAS BARELY GOING 10MPH AND IT WAS 70 DEGREES OUT). FROM THERE THE CAR WAS VERY SLUGGISH TAKING FOREVER TO GET UP TO SPEED AND I WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVERY TIME I HAD TO COME TO A STOP.    I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER WHO WOULD NOT GIVE ME OR COVER A RENTAL. I GOT MY CAR BACK 3 DAYS LATER AFTER THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE.

THEN THEY SENT ME A LETTER SIGNED BY A COMMITTEE TELLING ME THAT IT HAD BEEN CHECKED OUT AND THEY FOUND NO FAULT IN THE BRAKES.  UPON HEARING THIS I WENT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL WHEN I SHOWED HIM THE RECALL AS LISTED BY NHTSA HE SAID THAT SINCE I DOWN LOADED IT FROM THE INTERNET IT MAY NOT BE AUTHENTIC.

A HUMMING NOISE (SIMILAR TO THAT OF A \"RICE BURNER\" CAR) IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE THAT TOOK OVER THREE TRIPS TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT (FROM AUGUST 2006 TO JANUARY 2007) AND A TOTAL OF 20 DAYS BEING OUT OF SERVICE IS AT PRESENT REPAIRED.  2.  THERE IS A RATTLE UNDERNEATH THE CAR, EITHER COMING FROM THE MIDDLE OR THE REAR WHEN NOT APPLYING THE GAS AND SIMPLY \"CRUISING\" DOWN THE ROAD.  BUT WHEN I HIT THE GAS IT GOES AWAY.  3.  THERE IS A  NOISE IN THE FRONT TIRES WHEN I AM DRIVING BETWEEN 1 AND 3 RPMS.    4.  THE CAR PULLS TO THE RIGHT.    5.  THE HEADLIGHTS DIM INTERMITTENTLY FOR NO REASON, AS IF THERE IS A POWER DRAIN.  6.  THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL INTERMITTENTLY DOESN'T WORK.    7.  THE STATION CHANGER CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL INTERMITTENTLY DOESN'T WORK.  8.  WHEN DRIVING THE CAR WITHOUT THE AUTO STICK, THE DELAY IN PICK-UP IS VERY SLOW.  THIS IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM.    9.  THE CRUISE CONTROL HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN AND INCREASED IN SPEED ALL BY ITSELF ON A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF ROAD.    10.  THE AC FAN BEGAN MAKING EXCESSIVE NOISE ONE MONTH AFTER WE BOUGHT IT AND IT WAS SERVICED PROPERLY AND REMAINS IN WORKING ORDER.  11.   WHEN I AM SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND WE GO AROUND SHARP CORNERS OR STOP OR START QUICKLY, THE SEAT MAKES CLICKING NOISES UNDERNEATH AND MOVES SLIGHTLY EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE IN A LOCKED POSITION.  12.  THE MIDDLE ARMREST CONSOLE IS LOOSE AND CAUSES INJURY WHEN ENTERING THE CAR AND PLACING YOUR ELBOW/ARM ON IT FOR BALANCE.    13.  THE PIN STRIPING BEGAN TO WEAR OFF THE FIRST TIME I WASHED THE CAR WHICH WAS WITHIN WEEKS OF PURCHASE.    I FILED LEMON LAW AFTER PROBLEM #1 WAS IN SERVICE FOR THREE ATTEMPTS AND 15 DAYS OUT OF SERVICE.  I'M TOLD THAT SINCE IT IS FIXED, THEY WILL ADDRESS AND ATTEMPT TO FIX THE REMAINING ISSUES.  *JB",

I WENT TO TURN ON MY HEADLIGHTS AND AS I DID THE ENTIRE DASHBOARD PANEL WENT BLANK.  ALL METERS (ODOMETER, TACOMETER, AND SPEEDOMETER) DROPPED TO ZERO, BUT THEY QUICKLY CAME BACK ON.  WHEN THEY RETURNED TO NORMAL, THE TRANSMISSION HAD SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL, CAUSING ME TO NEARLY GET REAR-ENDED BY A CAR TRAVELING BEHIND ME. I WAS UNABLE TO SHIFT BACK INTO DRIVE. I CHANGED LANES AND GOT TO THE SHOULDER AND SHUT OFF THE CAR.  WHEN I SHUT IT OFF AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, I RESTARTED THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO PUT IT BACK INTO DRIVE.  BUT WHEN I HAD STARTED THE CAR, THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT HAD TURNED ON AND WOULD NOT EXTINGUISH.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR BACK TO MY APARTMENT AND LET IT BE PARKED.  WHEN I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE, I TRIED TO RESTART IT AND THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT HAD WENT OUT.  MY WIFE THEN DROVE THE CAR BACK TO THE CAR LOT  ON TUESDAY MORNING.  I HAD TALKED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, A ONE LAWSON@MILITARYCARS.COM, I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I FELT THE CAR IS AN UNSAFE CAR.  YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DESERVE THE CHANCE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  BUT WHO IS TO SAY THAT THE PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED CORRECTLY AND THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  WHAT IF MY WIFE AND MYSELF DON'T FIND OUT THAT IT WASN'T PERFECTLY FIXED UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. IF I'M DRIVING AND I HAVE AN ACCIDENT, DO YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE TO EXPLAIN TO MY FAMILY WHY YOU WOULD NOT TAKE MY CAR ON A RETURN BECAUSE IT'S UNSAFE? I HAVE ALWAYS PURCHASED DODGE VEHICLES.  I DON'T LIKE DRIVING ANYTHING BUT A DODGE.  I DON'T BLAME ANYONE AT MILIATARY CAR SALES OR EVEN DODGE.  BUT I DO NOT WANT THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE.  OUR LIVES HANG IN YOUR HANDS  MAKE US KEEP AN UNSAFE CAR OR LET US RETURN IT TODAY 13 OCT 2007 AT 1743.  *NM",

YESTERDAY AT 1430 MILES AS I WAS WAITING FOR THE LIGHT TO TURN GREEN, MY CAR WAS GOING TO STALL. MY RPM GAUGE WENT DOWN AND THEN WENT BACK UP.  I GOT THE SAME EXCUSE ONCE AGAIN THAT IT WAS THE TYPE OF FUEL AND THAT THERE EXISTED NO REPAIR FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID \"THE CAR IS WORKING THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED\" AND \"IT IS ALL THROUGH COMPUTERS NOW, DODGE FIXES THE PROBLEMS AND SENDS US THE SOFTWARE AND WE HOOK UP TO YOUR CAR. IN THE MEAN TIME, THERE IS NO REPAIR AVAILABLE AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY GET REPAIRED\". THE ONLY THING THEY DID WAS ADD A MOPAR FUEL ADDITIVE BUT I STILL HEAR THE NOISE.  I HAVE USED REGULAR, MID-GRADE, AND PREMIUM AND USED DIFFERENT STATIONS AND FUEL COMPANIES AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. THE RATTLING IS SO BAD THAT NOT EVEN WITH THE AC FULL BLAST CAN YOU TUNE IT OUT.   AS FAR AS THE POWER LOCK IS CONCERNED IT WAS REPAIRED, THEY SAID IT HAD A SHORT. THE BAD THING IS THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER POWER LOCKS BUT THE ONLY ONE ON THE DRIVER SIDE.  AS FAR AS SAFETY IS CONCERNED,YOU ARE UNABLE TO OPEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOORS OR THE REAR DOOR, AS THEY HAVE NO POWER LOCKS YOU HAVE TO DO THIS MANUALLY. I  HAD TO TEACH MY CHILD TO PULL ON THE LOCK IN ORDER TO OPEN THE DOOR IN THE MEAN TIME THIS GOT FIXED.  *JB",
