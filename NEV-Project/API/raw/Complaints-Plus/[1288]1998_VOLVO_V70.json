WHILE I WAS RIDING ON I695 AND WAS GOING ABOUT SIXTY MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE CAR JERKED AND CUT OFF, MEANING BLINKING IN AND OUT OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ALONG WITH THE ENGINE AS I WAS PULLING OVER ON THE SHOULDER, WHICH IS TERRIBLY UNSAFE. I ASSUMED AND THOUGHT VOLVO'S WERE GREAT ON MILES AND TRANSMISSION SO I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE HAVING THESE TYPE OF ISSUES. I AM A FIRST TIME VOLVO PURCHASER AND HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND IT'S TO EXPENSIVE FOR ALL THE HASSLES. ALL OF THE MINOR ISSUES WERE EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLE BEING A USED CAR. ALSO, I CANNOT EVEN CHECK THE TRANSMISSION FLUID LEVELS IN ORDER TO SEE IF ALL I NEED IS SOME TRANSMISSION FLUID, THE DIPSTICK THAT LEADS TO THE TRANSMISSION IS STUCK, AS IN I HAVE TRIED PULLING, TWISTING AND TURNING BUT TO NO AVAIL. AFTER PURCHASING A 300 DOLLAR KEY PAD FROM THE DEALER I EXPECT MORE FROM THE MANUAL AND AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO CHECK ALL FLUIDS ON THE VEHICLE. IF THESE MINOR ISSUES DIDN'T EVOLVE INTO MAJOR ISSUES WITH MY VOLVO VEHICLE I WOULD NOT HAVE AN ISSUE.

THESE CHILD SEATS WERE OF THE STATIONARY TYPE AND OF DIFFERENT MAKES. AS ONE OF THE REAR OUTBOARD SEAT BELTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED AT NO CHARGE FOR A SIMILAR CONCERN IN JUNE 2003, WE VISITED OUR REGIONAL VOLVO DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THE ISSUE. NEW BELT ASSEMBLIES WERE ORDERED AND ON MARCH 15TH OF THIS YEAR, BOTH OUTER REAR SEAT BELTS WERE REPLACED. THIS TIME, SINCE WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR, I RETRIEVED THE FAILED PARTS. EXAMINATION OF BOTH SEAT BELTS BUCKLES SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THE FAILURE OF THE BELTS' CHILD SEAT LOCKING TAB, WHICH IS PART OF THE BUCKLE, PREVENTED THE CHILD SEAT FROM STAYING SECURELY HELD IN POSITION. THESE ASSEMBLIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO ANALYZE AND DRAW AN EXPERT CONCLUSION.
