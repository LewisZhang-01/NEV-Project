AS A RESULT THE TIRE RECEIVED SOME DAMAGE WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE FLAT.  I HAD IT REPLACED AT THE SAME FIRESTONE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM BUT WAS PUZZLED BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE VERY CHEWED UP FOR THE SHORT DISTANCE I CONTINUED TO DRIVE ONCE I NOTICED THE FLAT.  THE TIRE WAS ONE OF FOUR I BOUGHT TOGETHER LESS THAN A YEAR AGO BUT THE ONE WHICH WENT FLAT WAS REPLACED BEFORE WORD OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SIMILAR TIRES WAS PUBLICIZED.  I AM STILL DRIVING ON THE OTHER 3 PLUS THE REPLACEMENT.  I AM VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE ONE OF THE TIRES (LEFT FRONT) HAS NEVER HELD AIR WELL, IN SPITE OF TAKING IT BACK FOR REMOUNTING, AND IT IS ONCE AGAIN LOSING AIR REGULARLY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT PROPERLY INFLATED.
