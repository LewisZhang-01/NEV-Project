SHE TOOK IT BACK TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP SHOP AND THEY REPLACED THE BEARING AND ALTHOUGH THE RIDE WAS QUIETER DUE TO THE NEW BEARING REPLACEMENT, THE ABS LIGHT AND OTHER LIGHTS DID NOT GO OFF.  THE MECHANIC TOLD HER THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE A WHEEL HUB WITH SENSOR AND BEARING IN THE HUB BUT THAT ALL OF HER PARTS WERE SEPARATE.  HE SAID THAT THE LIGHT MAY BE ON DUE THE SENSOR MAY HAVE DEBRIS FROM THE WHEEL BEARING GOING BAD OR POSSIBLY THE SENSOR IS GOING BAD ITSELF.  I PLANNED ON PULLING AND CLEANING THE SENSOR FOR HER IN THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. WELL BEFORE THE WEEKEND, SHE WENT SHOPPING AT THE GROCERY STORE AND WHEN SHE CAME OUT, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. THE BATTERY WAS DEAD.  WE CALL A TOW TRUCK DRIVER WHO CAME AND GAVE IT A QUICK JUMP AND SAID SHE MUST HAVE LEFT HER LIGHTS ON.
