THE WINDOW RATTLED AND GROANED WITH AN ELECTRICAL SOUND. I LOOKED AT THE WINDOW - IT HAD NOT ROLLED UP. I HAD TO GET TO WORK, SO I DROVE MY CAR WITH THE WINDOW IN THAT SHAPE. WHEN I GOT TO WORK I ASKED A CO-WORKER TO HELP ME TAPE IT UP. SO THEN, MY WINDOW WAS MANUALLY PUSHED UP BY TWO PEOPLE TRYING TO PUSH IT UP FROM THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE. THEN TAPE WAS APPLIED TO THE WINDOW TO HOLD IT UP, BUT IT STARTED TO SLIP DOWN. SO THE PERSON WHO WAS FIRST HELPING PUT A PIECE OF CARDBOARD ON THE INSIDE PART OF THE WINDOW, SAYING THAT WOULD PREVENT IT FROM FALLING DOWN. IT WORKED FOR AWHILE, BUT THEN THE CARDBOARD SLIPPED DOWN INTO THE WINDOW. SO THEN, I FOUND TWO BIGGER PIECES OF CARDBOARD TO HOLD IT IN THE CLOSED POSITION AND WE TAPED SOME MORE. IT IS NOW TAPED UP AND SO FAR IS HOLDING, BUT AS RAIN MAY COME, IT WILL PROBABLY FALL AGAIN. I CALLED JEEP AND ASKED HOW THIS COULD BE REPAIRED. THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST ABOUT $400.

I CONTACTED CHRYSLER, WHO INFORMED ME THAT MY JEEP WAS PART OF THE #R06 RECALL WHICH INVOLVED THE RANDOM DEPLOYMENT OF AIRBAGS, AND WHILE THEY CAN REPAIR MY AIRBAGS AND DASH, THEY CAN'T FIX THE MODULE THAT ACTUALLY CAUSED MY AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY.  THOSE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  IN OTHER WORDS, MY NEW AIRBAGS COULD DEPLOY AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING.

I SPOKE TO THE DEALER ON A VISIT IN THE FALL AFTER THE SECOND MAILED NOTIFICATION AND THE LOCAL DEALER TOLD ME THE PARTS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  I LEFT THEM MY NAME AND ASKED THEM TO CONTACT ME IF THE PARTS WERE AVAILABEL.  IN JANUARY OF 2015, I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALER AGAIN AND THEY CHUCKLED AND TOLD ME THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE BUT THEY COULD PUT ME ON THE GROWING LIST THEY KEPT AT THE DEALERSHIP.  SO I HAD NOT EVEN MADE IT ONTO THE LOCAL DEALER WAITING LIST YET!  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, I GOT A CALL A WEEK LATER FROM A CHRYSLER WARRANTY CUSTOMER CENTER.  I CALLED BACK AFTER THE SECOND CALL AND TOLD THEM THAT THE DEALER HAD LAUGHED AT ME JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE WHEN I HAD ASKED IF THE PARTS WERE AVAILABLE.  IN ADDITION TO THE DEFECTIVE GAS TANK LOCATION, MY JEEP ALSO HAS THE AIR BAGS THAT CAN INADVERTENTLY INFLATE (SUPPOSEDLY WITH A FEW SECONDS OF WARNING IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING AT THE DASHBOARD AND NOTICE A WARNING LIGHT).  I GOT THAT RECALL FIXED (A VERY LOW COST JUMPER) LAST FALL.  I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW MY JEEP MAY ALSO HAVE A DEFECTIVE TRW AIRBAG INFLATOR.  I SUSPECT THIS WAS THE ISSUE ALL ALONG BUT CHRYSLER TOOK THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE ROUTE (A JUMPER).  LASTLY, I HAVE SUBMITTED A FORMAL COMPLAINT ON THE NHTSA WEB SITE CONCERNING MY HEADLIGHTS GOING OFF BY THEMSELVES WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT.  THEY HAVE DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES AND NORMALLY COME BACK ON WITHIN 5 SECONDS.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT, THEY TOLD ME IT COULD BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS JUST TO TRY TO FIND OUT  WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT. RECENTLY I CHECKED IN THE INTERNET AND SAW THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER 2002  JEEP LIBERTY OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. SPEEDOMETER QUITS WORKING, MOTOR DIED WHEN YOU SLOWDOWN,  AND REPLACING THE SPEED SENSOR DOESN'T FIX ANYTHING. ITS DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU CAN CRASH WHEN MAKING A  TURN AND THE MOTOR DIES AND YOU LOSE YOUR STEERING. I KNOW I HAVE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS. I HOPE YOU WILL  CHECK IN TO THIS PROBLEM.

I WAS ADVISED THAT 1ST, THE NOISE SOUNDED LIKE THE ROCKER ARM OR BEADS AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST JEEP LIBERTY THEY HAVE SEEN WITH THIS PROBLEM AND 2ND IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR ME TO BE DRIVING THE JEEP WITH THIS PROBLEM AS THE ENGINE COULD POSSIBLY FAIL CAUSING A CRASH AND 3RD I WILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW MOTOR FOR THIS VEHICLE WHICH IS AROUND $2,000.00 AND UP FOR A REBUILT ENGINE OR $6,000.00 AND UP FOR A NEW ONE. I WAS STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND DIDN'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF $$ JUST LYING AROUND SO IT HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR OVER A YEAR.  FROM MY RESEARCH ONLINE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS CONSUMERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS SAME ENGINE PROBLEM YET CHRYSLER HAS NOT BEEN MADE TO RECALL THERE ENGINE FOR DEFECTIVE PARTS. ON BEHALF OF JEEP LIBERTY OWNERS THAT HAVE HAD TO FACE THIS HUGE PROBLEM, I AM REQUESTING THAT THIS ISSUE BE RESEARCHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!! JEEPS ARE NOT BOTTOM LINE VEHICLES AS MOST PEOPLE KNOW. I PERSONALLY PAID $30,000.00 FOR THIS VEHICLE AND AM FURIOUS AT THE LACK OF RESPONSE OR SENSE OF URGENCY BY CHRYSLER TO RESOLVE THIS AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES WITH THEIR VEHICLES. IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHARGE FOR VEHICLES LIKE THEY ARE 5 STAR VEHICLES, THEN YOU NEED TO SELL A 5 STAR PRODUCT OR GIVE 5 STAR RESPECTABLE SERVICE AND CORRECT YOUR DEFECTS.  *TR",

IT WAS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IN MY LIFE. I WAS GIVEN A 60 DAY VERBAL AGREEMENT THAT IF ANYTHING BROKE DOWN, THEY WOULD FIX. IT. MY LOAN WAS THROUGH UNITED FINANCE COMPANY, P.O. BOX 862, AUBURN, WA 98071. A VEHICLE INSPECTION WAS DONE ON THE CAR MY THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR, I LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE MY DAD WAS VERY SICK. I WAS GONE FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS.  WHEN I CAME BACK FROM CALIFORNIA, THE SECOND DAY I GOT BACK, I DROVE IT A FEW BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE, AND THE CAR STOPPED ON ME AT A STOP SIGN! IT STARTED SMOKING FROM THE BACK AND FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND IT WOULDN'T START. I HAD IT TOWED FOR THE NIGHT. I THEN CALLED SEATTLE AUTO MART, WHERE I GOT THE CAR FROM AND THEY HAD THEIR PEOPLE TO COME AND PICK IT UP. I TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT I JUST WANTED IT FIXED.  THEN THEY CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR WAS THAT THE ENGINE BLEW  AND  THAT I WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT THE POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OR THEY COULD GET USED PARTS AND I WOULD PAY NOTHING. I TOLD THEM TO GO AHEAD AND FIX THE CAR WITH THE USED PARTS (EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN NEW PARTS). I DIDN'T MAKE A PAYMENT UNTIL THE CAR WAS FIXED. THEN SO I DECIDED TO CUT MY LOSSES SINCE THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO HELP ME AND I GAVE THE CAR BACK. A MONTH LATER, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL FROM THE CHRYSLER GROUP LLC STATING THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A SMALL FUEL LEAK AND COULD RESULT IN A FIRE. ON SATURDAY APRIL 5, 2014 I RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE ! OVERALL SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE!

A SUPERVISOR RETURNED MY CALL AND INFORMED ME THAT THE AGE OF THE VEHICLE WAS THE REASON NO ASSISTANCE WOULD BE OFFERED.

I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM MY DAUGHTER AND HAVE VISITED COURTESY MOTOR SALES TWICE SINCE I PURCHASED (LATEST AUGUST 27, 2013) WITH THE SAME ANSWER \"WE DON'T HAVE THE PARTS AVAILABLE AND WE WILL CONTACT YOU WHEN THEY ARRIVE\"!  IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NOT BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM!  AT THE PRESENT TIME I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS NOW ON CONSTANTLY AND THE RECALL NOTES THAT .....\"A DAMAGED COMPUTER CHIP COULD CAUSE THE AIRBAG LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE, FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY AN INADVERTENT DEPLOYMENT OF THE FRONT AIRBAGS (LIBERTY AND GRAND CHEROKEE)......\". THE RECALL NOTICE CONTINUES BY STATING THAT  \"INAVERTENT DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAGS MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF INJURY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A VEHICLE CRASH\".   HOW MANY MORE INJURIES AND POSSIBILITIES OF CRASHING MUST IT TAKE TO GET ACTION ON THIS?           IN CONCLUSION, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR RECALLS ARE NOT BEING \"TENDED TO\"  IN AN EXPEDIENT MANNER.  I AM GETTING \"LIP SERVICE\" AND YOU ARE BEING IGNORED.  IF EITHER OF THESE RECALL PROBLEMS DO HAPPEN, BOTH YOUR ORGANIZATION (FOR NOT ENFORCING IN A TIMELY MANNER) AND CHRYSLER MOTOR CORPORATION (FOR DELAYING REMEDY) WILL BE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  *TR",

I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE ITS BEEN OVER NINE MONTHS SINCE I RECEIVED THE FIRST CHRYSLER'S LETTER, BUT SPECIALLY BECAUSE NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHEN MY CAR IS GOING TO BE REPAIRED! I TOOK MY CAR TO A PRIVATE MECHANIC, AND HE TOLD ME THAT IF I GET INVOLVED IN A CAR ACCIDENT, THE AIRBAG WON'T GO OFF.

I HAVE CALLED THEM MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. I ALSO TRIED TO CONTACT THE JEEP DEALER IN DOVER, DELAWARE AND SPOKE TO A VERY RUDE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS NO HELP TO ME.   *TR",

THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS OF A SLUDGE ISSUE ON THE 3.7L ENGINES. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE BUT AFTER SPEAKING WITH A MAN THAT WORKED FOR DODGE HE CONFIRMED THAT THEY DID A SILENT RECALL ON THESE ISSUES FOR THE 3.7L ENGINE.

I DON'T THINK THIS ISSUE IS VERY FUNNY AND IT COULD HAVE CAUSED ME TO CRASH IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING WHEN THE CYLINDER BLEW.

I CALLED CHRYSLER'S TOLL-FREE NUMBER TODAY AFTER THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT AGAIN, AND WAS INFORMED THAT MY JEEP IS UNDER RECALL FOR THE AIR BAG MODULE, AND MAYBE THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING THE LIGHTS TO GO OUT. THIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT ONE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHER. I TOLD THEM THAT I HAVE SEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE HEADLIGHTS, BUT THEY STATED THAT THEY'VE HAD NO COMPLAINTS. I HAVE ALSO REPLACED FRONT TIRES THREE TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR FOR WEAR ON THE OUTSIDE EDGE. I'VE HAD THE JEEP ALIGNED, TIRES ROTATED AS THEY SHOULD BE, AND THEY JUST KEEP BALDING ON THE OUTER EDGE.

I LEARNED CHRYSLER KNEW SINCE 2002 ABOUT THE DEFECTIVE WINDOWS.  THEY FINALLY RECALLED BACK SOME OF THE 2006 AND 2007 JEEPS.  I CALLED THEM AND THEY DO NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DANGER THIS COULD CAUSE.  I FEEL BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE USE OF THE WINDOW IS WHY WE HAVE NOT HAD THE PROBLEMS SEVERAL HAVE HAD. THEY THEN PROCEED TO CHARGE YOU $500. TO REPAIR THE WINDOW WITH THE SAME KIND OF PART THAT WILL BREAK AGAIN.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE.  I ASKED CHRYSLER ABOUT THIS PART, THEY CONFESS JUST RECENTLY THEY HAVE CHANGED THE PART TO WORK.  I SEE THE DANGER THIS COULD BE IF HAULING A YOUNG CHILD.  EVEN THOUGH A CHILD IS TO BE IN A CHILD SEAT, THEY SOMETIMES CAN GET OUT.  IF DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE WINDOW JUST DROPS, A CHILD COULD FALL OUT.  IN A WRECK THIS COULD ENDANGER ANYONE.  ALL THE WINDOWS IN THE JEEP HAVE A PROBLEM OF  BREAKING FOR NO REASON, BUT MOSTLY THE BACK WINDOWS.  CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THIS AND SHOULD HAVE RECALLED ALL THESE WINDOWS.  THEY ARE BLEEDING THE JEEP OWNERS BY HAVING TO CONTINUE TO REPAIR THE DEFECTIVE WINDOWS AND ARE ENDANGERING PEOPLE'S LIFE.  THEY SHOULD BE MADE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEFECTIVE PARTS THAT THEY KNEW THEY HAD AND CONTINUED TO USE.  *TR",

VERY EXPENSIVE FOR SIMPLE FIX, COST OVER $100 FOR ENTIRE NEW REGULATOR, AS PLASTIC CLIP IS NOT AVAILABLE SEPARATELY.  THANKFULLY I AM MECHANICALLY INCLINED AND I WAS ABLE TO INSTALL IT MYSELF, AS ESTIMATE FROM THEN DAIMLER-CHRYSLER WAS OVER $300 FOR REPAIR.  SINCE THAT TIME, THE OTHER WINDOW REGULATOR BROKE IN THE EXACT SAME FASHION, AND BEING THE REPLACEMENT PART HAD GONE UP EVEN FURTHER IN COST, I TAPED WINDOW SHUT.  BEFORE I COULD AFFORD TO FIX OTHER WINDOW, THE ONE I HAD PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED BROKE AGAIN IN AN IDENTICAL FASHION.  ALL THREE REAR WINDOW REGULATORS, BOTH FACTORY ORIGINALS, AND ONE FACTORY REPLACEMENT, BROKE WITHIN 3 YEARS.  BOTH WINDOWS WERE THEN TAPED UP, AS I WASN'T ABOUT TO BUY WELL OVER $200 WORTH OF TROUBLE PRONE REPLACEMENT PARTS ONLY TO HAVE SITUATION TAKE PLACE YET AGAIN.  THANKFULLY, AN AFTERMARKET SOURCE NOW SELLS METAL PARTS TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE, WEAR PRONE PARTS SUPPLIED BY CHRYSLER-JEEP.  IT COST $100 TO FURTHER REPAIR BOTH WINDOWS WITH AFTERMARKET METAL PARTS, AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED NO TROUBLE SINCE.

SOMETIMES ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS. OFTEN FEEL A \"VIBRATION.\"    WITHIN MONTHS OF BEING 1 YEAR OF REPLACING THE IAV, BEGAN TO GET EXTREMELY BAD GAS MILEAGE - ABOUT 187M TO A TANK. NOT SURE WHY. REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS, DID A LOF, INSPECTION, ETC.. ALMOST EXACTLY 1 YEAR FROM REPLACING THE IAV, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. WAS ON FOR 1-1.5 DAYS. I DECIDED NOT USE IT UNTIL I COULD GET IT TO THE MECHANIC. NEXT MORNING, WAS GOING TO THE STORE & THE LIGHT WAS OFF! BUT WHEN I PULLED INTO A PARKING SPACE, IT DIED.    THIS SORT OF THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE, DB CLUSTER BEING \"FAULTY.\" OTHER THINGS [VACUUM SEAL LEAK, ETC] NEVER PROMPTED THE LIGHTS ON. HAD TO REPLACE THE IAV AGAIN & IT RAN FINE.

GOT IT HOME, TURNED IT OFF, WAITED, TURNED IT ON, WAITED A FEW SECONDS AND THE LIGHT TURNED OFF THIS TIME. WENT STRAIGHT TO MY COMPUTER ONLY TO FIND THESE RECALLS AND INVESTIGATIONS - ONE BEING THE STEERING - LAST WEEK HAD A NERVE-WRACKING EXPERIENCE, MY CAR BEGAN TO SWERVE TURNING LEFT ONTO THE FREEWAY, IT WAS RAINING, SO, I SLOWLY MERGED. WASN'T UNTIL IT STRAIGHTENED OUT THAT IT BEGAN TO SWERVE, ALMOST LIKE LOSING CONTROL, DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A \"SLIP.\" BUT I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS.

THE ENGINE ROARED AS IF ACCELERATING AND RPMS FLUCTUATED FROM HIGH TO LOW WITHOUT INCREASING ACTUAL VEHICLE SPEED AND LOST CONTROL OF STEERING AND COASTED UNTIL CAR STOPPED. THE DASHBOARD LIT UP FOR BATTERY, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, AND OIL AND ALL OTHER POWER STAYED ON, INCLUDING RADIO AND HEADLIGHTS AND EMERGENCY LIGHTS. WHEN CAR CAME TO A STOP, I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED IT OFF AND RESTARTED IT. DASHBOARD INDICATORS TURNED OFF AND CAR STARTED NORMALLY TO ONLY REPEAT THE SAME ENGINE STALL LESS THAN A MILE AWAY AT A SLOWER SPEED. CAR THEN REQUIRED SEVERAL MORE ATTEMPTS TO START ENGINE. AT THIS TIME, THE CAR HAD A 1/2 TANK OF GAS. THE NEXT DAY I CHANGED ALL FLUIDS INCLUDING OIL, ANTIFREEZE, COOLANT AND ADDED A FUEL INJECTION CLEANER AND FILLED CAR TO A FULL TANK AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE BACK HOME WITHOUT ISSUE. NEXT TIME CAR WAS USED SAME ENGINE STALL HAPPENED AS CAR WAS IN REVERSE AND WITHOUT THE RPM FLUCTUATION OR DASHBOARD INDICATORS LIGHTING UP. NEW BATTERY INSTALLED AND HOOKED UP TO COMPUTER FOR DATA CODES WHICH REVEALED NO ERROR CODES. CAR CURRENTLY IN SHOP FOR 7 DAYS WITH OVER $500 IN COSTS THAT DID NOT SOLVE PROBLEM. CAR MAINTENANCE IN GREAT SHAPE AT 103700 MILES AND FULL CAR TUNEUP DONE JUST LAST YEAR BY JEEP DEALERSHIP. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE MECHANIC OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IT COULD BE OR NOT BE, AND INVEST MONEY IN REPAIRS THAT MAY NOT EVEN SOLVE THE PROBLEM. TOTAL ENGINES FAILURES/STALLS IN ONE WEEK AVERAGED 2 TIMES EACH TIME THE CAR WAS DRIVEN. GIVEN THE TRAFFIC AND TRAVELING SPEED OF THE CAR, I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE AVOIDED COLLISION BUT DO NOT FEEL SAFE OR TRUST TO USE MY CAR ESPECIALLY AFTER READING COMPLAINTS OF OTHERS EXPERIENCING SAME ENGINE FAILURE WITHOUT A SOLUTION PROVIDED THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  *TR",

I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT THE NEAREST CHRYSLER DEALER THAT WOULD HONOR THIS RECALL AND FIX MY CAR WAS IN ARLINGTON, TX WHICH IS NEARLY 20 MILES FROM MY HOME.

I WAS TOLD BY DRIVETIME THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING RECALL NOTICES ON THE CARS THAT THEY SELL AND THAT IT IS CHRYSLER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX MY JEEP.  I AGAIN CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE TO A SUPERVISOR.  I WAS INFORMED THAT CHRYSLER WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIRS AND IF I PAY FOR THE REPAIRS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.  *TR LOWER BALL JOINTS*SMCH",

I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE FOUND OUT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR CHRYSLER PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE INTREPID AND DURANGO. IT IS NOW STARTING TO SHOW UP ON VEHICLES LIKE MINES, WHICH IS A JEEP LIBERTY. MY VEHICLE'S CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON DECEMBER 21, 2007 AND IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS EVERY SINCE. I WAS INFORMED IT IS AWAITING A CAMSHAFT THAT IS ON A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER WITH NO ETA. IN MY OPINION, IT IS OBVIOUS OTHER VEHICLES ARE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE DEALER REFUSE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE ALL OF MY RECEIPTS FOR OIL CHANGES. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 61,000 MILES AND I WAS ABLE TO COME UP WITH RECEIPTS FROM 38,000 UP UNTIL THE CURRENT MILEAGE. THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS SUCH AS OVERHEATING AND CYLINDER HEAD REPLACEMENT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, 49,622, 51,621, 51,793, 55,182, 57,269 AND FINALLY 61,211, ALL DUE TO ENGINE SLUDGING. I WAS TOLD ALL THE PROBLEMS WERE DUE TO IMPROPER OIL CHANGES AND/OR CHEEP GASOLINE; HOWEVER, I HAVE CHANGED THE OIL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S SUGGESTED INTERVALS AND HAVE ALWAYS USED GASOLINE FROM DISTRIBUTORS SUCH AS AMOCO, EXXON AND VALERO. I SUSPECT THIS IN ANOTHER DEFECTIVE CHRYSLER PRODUCT THAT WILL COST THE MANUFACTURER MILLIONS IF THEY DID THE RIGHT THING. WHY IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF CAMSHAFTS FOR THIS VEHICLE? WHY IS THIS PART IN HIGH DEMAND? HOPEFULLY YOUR INVESTIGATION WILL REVEAL WHAT IS TRULY GOING ON.

WELL ANYWAY, THEY  WERE TO REPLACE IT, AND I CALLED THE SAME DAY I GOT THE NOTICE AND WAS PUT ON A WAITING LIST TO GET THIS FIXED DUE TO BACKORDER OF PARTS.  I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ,AND I BELIEVE THIS WAS MY 4TH TIME CONTACTING SOMEONE ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  I HAVE SUBMITTED 2 COMPLAINTS ALREADY TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OF NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY, AND NOW THIS IS WHAT I WAS E-MAILED BACK AND TOLD TO DO .  MY BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THE SAFETY OF MY CHILDREN AND MY FAMILY.  WE DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ON A DAILY BASIS,  AND  I NOT ONLY THINK IT WAS UNFAIR TO US TO BE ENDANGERING OUR LIVES,  BUT ALSO THE LIVES OF MANY OTHER DRIVERS IF MY VEHICLE WAS TO LOSE CONTROL.  I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE SUPPLIED WITH A RENTAL CAR VIA THEIR EXPENSE UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I THINK 4 MONTHS HAS BEEN VERY ADEQUATE TIME, AND  THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD IT RESOLVED BY NOW.  RECENTLY, WE TOOK A ROAD TRIP AND HAD TO RENT A CAR BECAUSE WE WERE TOO SCARED TO DRIVE THIS FAR THROUGH MOUNTAINS, ETC.  HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A BALL JOINT BLOWING OUT!

KONA IS 45 MILES FROM MY TOWN OF KAMUELA. MY WIFE DROVE THE CAR HOME AND EVERY TIME SHE STEPPED ON THE BRAKES, THE FRONT BRAKES MADE A LOUD CLUNK, LOUDER EACH TIME. SHE ALSO NOTICED A RATTLING SOUND. WHEN SHE CAME TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT IN TOWN. THE CAR ALMOST DIDN'T STOP. SHE HAD TO DOWN SHIFT AND EVEN HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKES TO KEEP FROM REAR ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF HER. I TEST DROVE THE CAR THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY WRONG. I STARTED TO DRIVE BACK TO KONA. I TO HAD TO DOWN SHIFT AND USE THE   EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP. IF I TOUCHED THE BRAKE, THE FRONT BRAKES WOULD MAKE A LOUD BANG AND THEN WOULD RATTLE, WITH NO STOPPING POWER. HALF WAY BACK I HAD TO STOP. I CRAWLED UNDER THE CAR AND FOUND TO MY AMAZEMENT THAT ONE BOLT ON EACH FRONT BRAKE CALIPER WAS MISSING AND THE OTHER BOLT WAS ONLY FINGER TIGHT. I CALLED THE KONA AUTO CENTER AND SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER  JEFF. I TOLD HIM I WAS ON MY WAY AND HOW DANGEROUS MY SITUATION WAS.  JEFF MET ME AS I ARRIVED. HE ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED. I TOLD HIM I JUST WANTED THE TWO BOLTS PUT BACK AND TORQUE ALL THE HARDWARE AND THE BRAKES CHECKED. I ALSO TOLD HIM TO TELL ALL HIS EMPLOYEES THAT ANY TIME THEY TOUCH/DISCONNECT ANY BRAKE SYSTEM THEY BETTER PAY ATTENTION. MY FAMILY LIVES DEPEND ON THEM. HE OFFER ME SOME FREE SERVICING, BUT I TOLD HIM THAT HIS KONA SHOP HAS ALREADY LOST MY BUSINESS. I TYPICALLY DO ALL MY OWN MAINTENANCE. I WOULD THINK I COULD TRUST THE DEALERSHIP, BUT NOW I KNOW BETTER... PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS AND EMAIL ME BACK. VIN:  2W176146, MILEAGE:  78000, SERVICING DEALER:  KONA AUTO CENTER.  *NM",

MY WIFE CALLED AND HAD THE PART ORDERED FROM A LOCAL DEALER.  IT WAS ORDERED ON 11-16-6 AT 430PM.  I WAS DRIVING TO WORK ON 12-1-06, IN MY 2002 JEEP LIBERTY, AND LOST CONTROL OF THE JEEP WHILE HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON HWY 43 (IN WISCONSIN).  AS I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, I ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE WHEEL DIRECTION, BUT HAD NO SUCCESS.  THE JEEP WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  THE JEEP WENT PERPENDICULAR WITH THE LANES AND ENDED UP FLIPPING OVER.  I WAS THE RESTRAINED DRIVER WHILE THE JEEP FLIPPED ONE COMPLETE ROLL AND CAME TO A STOP IN THE DITCH.  I WAS ALERT ENOUGH TO CALL 911, AND WAS PICKED UP BY PARAMEDICS AND TAKEN TO SAINT NICHOLAS HOSPITAL IN SHEBOYGAN, WI.  AFTER BEING DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM, I CALLED THE GARAGE AT WHICH MY JEEP WAS TOWED.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY JEEP \"HAS BEEN TOTALED\".    I WOULD LIKE THIS COMPLAINT TO GO ON FILE AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS PROBLEM WILL BE RECTIFIED.  I AM STILL AWAITING A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO INFORM ME THAT MY PART HAS COME IN, BUT I NO LONGER AM ABLE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE.  PLEASE ADVISE ME AS TO MY NEXT STEP.   I AM EXPECTING A CALL FROM MY STATE FARM AGENT ON MONDAY AND WILL UPDATE THEM TO THIS MATTER.  MY INJURIES WERE MINOR, BUT I AM NOW SHORT A VEHICLE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW JEEP WILL BE HANDLING THIS SITUATION AND HOW I SHOULD BE HANDLING THIS.  PLEASE CALL OR EMAIL ME WITH INFORMATION.  THANKS,  LARRY THOMAS.  *NM",

IT SEEMS ODD THAT CHRYSLER WOULD ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL FOR A PROBLEM THAT THEY SAY \"CAN RESULT IN A LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL AND COULD CAUSE A CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING\" AND TAKE OVER 2 MONTHS TO MAKE THE PARTS AVAILABLE. CAN ANYTHING BE DONE TO FORCE THEM TO SPEED UP THEIR PRODUCTION OF THE NECESSARY PARTS FOR THIS RECALL?  *NM",

THE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP IS TO CALL ME IN THE MORNING IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME, WHICH DOES NOT LOOK PROMISING AT ALL.  MY ISSUE IS I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A PART THAT WAS NOT DAMAGED JUST SO THE RECALLED PARTS OF BALL JOINTS CAN FIT ON MY VEHICLE THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO FIT.  *JB",

ONE SATURDAY MORNING I CALLED A LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP TO ASK IF I COULD BRING IT IN AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT.

WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, MY PARTNER TOLD ME THAT SHE CONTACTED HER BROTHER AND HE SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS THE BALL JOINT.  I TRIED TO MOVE IT AND THE BALL JOINT BROKE AND DAMAGED THE TIRE AND THE GREY MATERIAL OVER THE TIRE.

IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT A FASTER SPEED, ON A TURN, THE CAR WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE CLIFF, ROLLED, AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY.     THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE:  AFTER THE INCIDENT, I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER.  ON ARRIVAL, THEY LOOKED UP THE VIN, AND INFORMED ME THAT THE RECALL (#03V460000) HAD ALREADY BEEN 'PERFORMED' BACK IN 2004.  IF THEY \"FIXED\" IT IN 2004->WHY DID IT BREAK IN 2006???!!!!  AND WHY ARE THEY SO QUICK TO FIX AND PAY FOR IT????  SEEMS TO ME THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR\"FIX\" BACK IN 2003.  SCARY!!!  PEOPLE THAT HAD IT \"FIXED\" RIGHT AFTER THE RECALL CAME OUT, MAY STILL BE IN DANGER!!  THE PARTS USED IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL MUST HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE!!!!      HERE IS THE WHOLE STORY:  1. RUBBING/GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM FRONT OF CAR.  VERY RANDOM AND INCONSISTENT.  HAPPENED WHILE TURNING STEERING WHEEL AT A STOP, WHILE DRIVING, HEARD NOISE WHEN APPLYING BRAKES, ETC.  NOISE STARTED AROUND MARCH '05.  2.  NUMEROUS TRIPS TO MECHANIC, COULDN'T FIND PROBLEM.  REPLACED BRAKES, RESURFACED DRUMS, CLEANED OUT POWER STEERING, ETC.  3. JUNE '06, DID GOOGLE SEARCHES TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE '02 JEEP LIBERTY.  FOUND THERE WERE \"BALL JOINT\" PROBLEMS.  ALSO FOUND RECALL #03V460000 (SUSPENSION:FRONT:CONTROL ARM:LOWER BALL JOINT).  4. SCHEDULED APPT. WITH DEALERSHIP TO GET RECALL #03V460000 PERFORMED.  5. BALL JOINT BROKE BEFORE APPT.

        "summary": "1.  I HAD DRIVEN THE VEHICLE ALL DAY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT WITHOUT ANY NOTICEABLE IRREGULARITIES.  ON THE MORNING OF THE FAILURE, MONDAY, JUNE 12TH, 2006, I HAD JUST STARTED THE MORNING COMMUTE TO THE BABYSITTERS WITH MY 1-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND HAD BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT A MILE DRIVING BETWEEN 55 AND 65 MPH WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED.    2.  THE FAILURE WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT TO BE A FLAT TIRE (FRONT DRIVER SIDE), ALTHOUGH I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED A FLAT TIRE THAT SLOWED A VEHICLE  SO FAST AND JERKED THE CAR SO SUDDENLY.  I HONESTLY FEARED THAT THE VEHICLE MIGHT FLIP OR ROLL OVER, AND SEEING OTHER CARS NEARBY IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, THE SAFETY OF MYSELF, MY DAUGHTER, AND OTHER DRIVERS WAS MY INITIAL CONCERN.  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW BAD THIS MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT IN THE WINTER ON A SNOWY SURFACE OR EVEN JUST A RAIN SOAKED SURFACE.  ONCE I GOT THE VEHICLE SLOWED DOWN AND ONTO THE SHOULDER, I ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE THE DESTROYED TIRE.  IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER GETTING ALL OF THE LUG NUTS OFF OF THE WHEEL THAT I REALIZED THERE WAS A BIGGER PROBLEM.  THE WHEEL WOULD NOT BUDGE.    3.  I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST LOCAL TIRE STORE (TIRES PLUS).  THAT IS WHEN THEY DIAGNOSED THE BROKEN LEFT LOWER BALL JOINT WHICH HAD SEPARATED AND BECAME LODGED INTO THE WHEEL AND DESTROYED THE WHEEL.  I HAD TIRES PLUS REPLACE THE BALL JOINT, ORDER A NEW (CONDITIONED) WHEEL, AND REPLACE THE TIRE.  LATER THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE LOWER RIGHT BALL JOINT WAS LOOSE/HAD MOVEMENT AND ADVISED ME TO HAVE IT REPLACED ALONG WITH A SECOND NEW TIRE AS WELL.  I AM ASSUMING THIS STEERING/SUSPENSION ISSUE CAUSED EXCESSIVE WEAR TO THE TWO FRONT TIRES.  I AUTHORIZED THE REPAIRS AND AM NOW OUT A LITTLE OVER $1200.    INTERNET RESEARCH TODAY LED ME TO MANY INCIDENTS INVOLVING JEEP LIBERTY LOWER BALL JOINT FAILURES AND AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.  NO HELP/CONSOLATION/REIMBURSEMENT WAS OBTAINED ON THE PHONE WITH DAIMLER CHRYSLER.  THEY BASICALLY SAID \"SORRY, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO\".  *JB",

SUDDENLY I HEARD A LOUD, METALLIC \"THUMP\" FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE VEHICLE PULLING SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT WITH NO STEERING CONTROL.

I THEN ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE FORWARD AND AGAIN, AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET OF DRIVING, I HEARD A SCRAPPING SOUND. I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AND INSPECTED THE SPARE WHEEL. I THEN NOTICED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT LOWER BALL JOINT HAD FAILED AND WAS DIGGING INTO THE INSIDE OF THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL RIM. I THEN CALLED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST JEEP DEALER. SUBSEQUENTLY I WAS ADVISED THAT BOTH FRONT BALL JOINTS WERE REPLACED AND THAT THE IMPACT WAS OF SUCH FORCE WHEN THE BALL JOINT FAILED THAT THE FRONT AXLE SEALS HAD BEEN DAMAGED AND WERE REPLACED.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD THE LOWER BALL JOINTS REPLACED AND A HEAT SHIELD INSTALLED.    SECOND PROBLEM:   WITHOUT WARNING ON JULY 28, 2005, THE FRONT RIGHT LOWER BALL JOINT BROKE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE THE JEEP INTO OUR GARAGE, AND THE FRONT END COLLAPSED ONTO THE PAVEMENT AND THE DISCONNECTED WHEEL. THERE WAS NO NOISE OR ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.     THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THIS:  I STARTED UP THE ENGINE, BACKED THE JEEP UP A FEW FEET TO STRAIGHTEN MY APPROACH, AND ATTEMPTED TO PULL IT INTO THE GARAGE. HOWEVER, I NOTICED A STRONG RESISTANCE TO ROLL FORWARD SO I STOPPED, GOT OUT AND LOOKED AROUND TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T RUNNING OVER SOMETHING.  AFTER SEEING NOTHING IN THE WAY OR UNDER THE VEHICLE, I TRIED AGAIN TO PULL FORWARD, BUT IT WOULDN'T ROLL AND THE WHEEL SKID. SO I PUT IT INTO REVERSE AND TRIED TO BACK UP. THAT IS WHEN THE FRONT END DROPPED WITH A LOAD CRUNCH ONTO THE WHEEL THAT HAD CAME OFF. THE JEEP DEALER PAID FOR THE NEW BALL JOINT AND SEVERAL OTHER PARTS THAT WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE INCIDENT.

FURTHER, I HAVE HEARD THAT IF THE G-FORCE WAS NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO DEPLOY THE SIDE AIRBAGS, THE JEEP SHOULD NOT HAVE ROLLED (I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT IS TRUE).

I CONTACTED JEEP AND ASKED THEM TO LOOK INTO IT.  THEY DID DO SOME INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE MY JEEP WAS NOT PRESERVED FOR THEIR INSPECTION THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.

WE ALSO REPLACED THE TIRES TRYING TO ELIMINATE PROBLEM, WHICH CONTINUED UNTIL  THE 3/31/05 ACCIDENT.  MY DAUGHTER WAS TRAVELING  DOWN THE HIGHWAY ON 3/31/05  A SUNNY DRY DAY IN NEW BRITAIN CT WHEN SHE SUDDENLY LOST  CONTROL OF HER JEEP AND SIDE SWIPED THE JERSEY  BARRIER.

THE FAILURE CAUSED LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE JEEP LIBERTY AND IT SIDE-SWIPED THE JERKY BARRIER.  THERE WAS ABOUT $6,000 DAMAGE TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE JEEP, NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED.  THE POLICE OFFICER ATTRIBUTED THE ACCIDENT TO TIRE FAILURE, SINCE THE 2 DRIVER'S SIDE TIRES WERE FLAT.  WHEN EXAMINING THE JEEP AT THE BODY SHOP, I NOTICED THE LOWER CONTROL ARM WAS BROKEN.  I DIDN'T THINK THE CRASH WAS SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN.  ON CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE PART  IT  LOOKED TO ME LIKE THE BROKEN EDGE WAS ABOUT HALF  RUSTED.  TO ME THIS INDICATED A PREEXISTING CRACK IN THE CASTING.  I AM REPORTING THIS INCIDENT BECAUSE I CAN'T PROOF THE JEEP'S PART FAILED.

THE CAR WAS SPINNING, BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE ROAD - HIT 3 TREES, MAILBOXES AND A TELEPHONE POLE (HARD ENOUGH THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE LAST THING THAT I HIT, IT MOVED ENOUGH THAT IT TORE THE CABLES OUT OF SOMEONE'S HOUSE). ABOUT 50 FEET BEFORE THE 1ST TREE, WAS MY FRONT PASSENGER TIRE AND ABOUT 2 FEET OF THE AXLE (OR WHATEVER HOLDS THE RIM AND TIRE ON THE TRUCK). THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK FROM THE RIGHT FRONT QUARTER PANEL TO 1/3 ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK IS UP INSIDE THE DASHBOARD, THE BACK DRIVER'S TIRE IS BLOWN OUT, THE SPARE TIRE ON THE BACK IS SMASHED, THE 2 PASSENGER SIDE DOORS ARE SMASHED AND THE ENTIRE TRUCK IS OFF THE FRAME. I TOLD THE TOW DRIVER AND POLICE ABOUT THE RECALL THAT I'D JUST GOTTEN THAT STATED THAT THE \"A BALL JOINT THAT HAS SEPARATED FROM THE KNUCKLE COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF VEHICLE DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AND COULD RESULT IN A CRASH.\" I HAD AN APPOINTMENT TO GET IT FIXED 4/6/04...THE ACCIDENT WAS 4/4/04.  MY INJURIES: AIRBAGS DIDN'T GO OFF BUT I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT. I BROKE MY ARM (8 WEEKS IN CAST, 6 WEEKS IN A BRACE AND I'M STILL IN PHYSICAL THERAPY. STANDARD SEATBELT BRUISE THAT LASTED MORE THAN 3 WEEKS, AND THE ASSOCIATED PAIN. MY INSURANCE IS COVERING MY MEDICAL AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CAR (WITH FINANCING, IT PAID EXACTLY WHAT I OWED). SO, EVEN THOUGH JEEP KNEW ABOUT THE NEED FOR A RECALL IN OCTOBER 2003, I WASN'T NOTIFIED UNTIL MARCH 2004.   IT WAS A CLEAR DRY NIGHT. I WAS AWAKE AND COHERENT, NOT SPEEDING OR DRINKING, AND PAYING ATTENTION WHEN I SUDDENLY LOST CONTROL. IN FACT, IT'S [XXX] LUCKY THAT I WAS ONLY GOING 35-40. JEEP CLAIMS THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE. ALL I WANT IS FOR THEM TO ADMIT THAT THEY WERE AT FAULT. IF THEY'D SENT THE RECALL NOTICE IN A TIMELY MANNER, BACK IN 10-11/03, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED PRIOR TO ANOTHER WINTER OF SNOW AND SLEET AND CRAP GETTING INTO THAT JOINT TO CORRODE IT!    *LA    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I AM UNABLE TO KEEP TIRES ON THE JEEP BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO COME OUT OF ALIGNMENT. THE VEHICLE PULLS TO THE RIGHT. I HAVE TAKEN IT IN SEVERAL TIMES TO TWO DIFFERENT JEEP DEALERS AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE HAD 4 SETS OF GOODYEAR TIRES ON THE FRONT OF THE JEEP AND THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 28,000 MILES ON IT!  ALL OF WHICH CONTINUE TO BE DAMAGED BY THE JEEP.  EVEN AFTER THE RECALL OF THE BALL JOINT IN THE FRONT END WHICH WAS REPLACED I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM.  THE JEEP HAS BEEN ALIGNED MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT, YET I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE BECAUSE IT WANTS TO JUMP ALL OVER THE ROAD. CHRYSLER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM EVEN AFTER 6 TRIPS TO THE DEALER.  THE VEHICLE PULLS TO THE RIGHT, RUINS THE TIRES THEN IS KNOCKED OUT OF ALIGNMENT.  IT\u0019S A VICIOUS CIRCLE.  THEY BLAME IT ON THE TIRES EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PROVEN FOUR TIMES IT\u0019S THE JEEP THAT RUINS THE TIRES.  NOT ONLY HAVE I HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS DANGEROUS JEEP BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP IT ALIGNED I HAVE ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH WATER AND MOLD INSIDE THE CAR FOR THE PAST YEAR.  I HAVE HAD THE JEEP AT A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP SIX TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND EACH TIME I CONTINUE TO LEAVE THE DEALERSHIP IN A 2002 JEEP THAT IS ALL OVER THE ROAD, NEW TIRES THAT ARE CUPPED AND THAT REEKS FROM MOLD AND MILDEW.

THIS WAS ON A TUESDAY.  ON FRIDAY, OCT. 10, 2003, I WAS MAKING A RIGHT TURN INTO A GAS STATION AND MY CAR SKIDDED CAUSING ME TO LOSE BRIEF CONTROL OF MY CAR AGAIN.  I WAS ABLE TO STRAIGHTEN UP THE CAR AND AVOID ANOTHER 360 AND POSSIBLE COLLISION WITH GAS PUMPS.  LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS HURT AND THERE WAS NOT ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE IN EITHER SITUATION.  AT THIS POINT, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP ([XXX]) WHO TOLD ME IT WAS MY TIRES.  I WENT TO GOODYEAR AND THEY SAID MY TIRES WERE FINE AND I SHOULD GO TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN AND THEY WOULD CHECK IT OVER BUT THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR AND I REALLY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I RECEIVED GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  MY REASON FOR SUBMITTING THIS NOW IS BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN ARTICLES AND MY MOTHER HEARD IT ON THE NEWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT RECALL ON 2002 JEEP LIBERTIES THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TONIGHT AND ASKED THEM ABOUT A RECALL AND THEY DENIED THAT THERE IS ONE.  I AM ALSO UNABLE TO FIND IT ON YOUR SIGHT ALTHOUGH THE ARTICLE I READ STATED IT AS BEING RELEASED BY YOU.  I HAVE BEEN LUCKY THAT IT HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN BUT I DO NOT FEEL AS SAFE IN MY CAR AS I DID BEFORE THE INCIDENTS.

AS I LOOKED AT THE JACK AS I WAS TURNING THE HANDLE, I COULD SEE THAT THE POSITION WITHIN THE JACK STAND WAS NO MOVING HIGHER, I HAD REACHED THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT. THIS WAS A MOJOR PROBLEM. HOW TO RAISE THE VEHICLE HIGH ENOUGH TO GET THE NEW TIRE ON. THE ONLY CHOISE I HAD WAS TO FIND SOMETHING TO PUT UNDER THE JACK. I NEEDED AT LEAST 3 TO 4 INCHES TO RAISE THE JACK UP SO THE I COULD RAISE THE VEHICLE BY THE SAME AMOUNT. I WAS ABLE TO FIND A TREE BRANCH WHICH I PLACED UNDER THE JACK. THIS WAS HAPPENING ON A INTERSTATE HIGHWAY. AFTER PUTTING THE BRANCH UNDER THE JACK I WAS ABLE TO RAISE THE VEHICLE UP HIGH ENOUGH TO PUT ON THE SPARE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PISTON WITHIN THE JACK WILL ONLY TO UP HIGH ENOUGH TO TAKE A FLAT TIRE OFF, BUT NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PUT A SPARE TIRE ON. THE PISTON IS TO SHORT BY ABOUT 3 TO 4 INCHES. I FEEL THAT THERE IS A REAL SAFETY ISSUE HERE. PUTTING A TREE BRANCH UNDER THE JACK IS NOT HOW ONE CHANGES A TIRE. AS I WAS RAISING THE VEHICLE I THOUGHT IF THE WEIGHT IF THE LIBERTY CRUSHED THE BRANCH I WAS GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE PROBLEMS. HOW I WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE JACK IN THE RIGHT POSITION. OR EVEN WORSE WAS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I HAVE MYSELF UNDER THE VEHICLE IN SOMEWAY AND THE BRANCH CAME APART, THAT WAS GOING TO HURT. WHAT JEEP NEEDS TO DO IS RE-DESIGN THE JACK. THE STAND EITHER HAS TO BE TALLER OR THE PISTION HAS TO BE LONGER TO GET THE VEHICLE HIGH ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE SPARE. AS A SIDE NOTE PLEASE MAKE THE COMMET SECTION BIGGER.
