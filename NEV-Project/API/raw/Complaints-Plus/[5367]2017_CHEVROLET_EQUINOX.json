As soon as I pulled in, the car started to get smoky in the inside so I hurry up and jump out wasn't sure if the car was going to start a fire. When I go inside the shop it was a lady with the same car as mine but just gold and she was complaining that oil was pouring out. The owner of the shop asked me what's wrong because I was a little distraught and I told him my car just slowed down and start smoking inside of the car. He said what ok ill take it right in to see what's wrong. 10 mins later he comes out with a video on his phone showing oil leaking all around the the engine, Trans and front of the car all the way to the muffler. He said this is common with these Equinox with the 4 cylinder engine, the rear main seal did not hold and all the oil leaked out. I bust out crying, I didn't even make it to 3yrs yet and still owe 12,000 on the car. I keep up with oil changes and the car never said I was low on oil I checked, it showed 40%. The owner say calm down we can call the dealership to see if they have a recall. So we call they knew exactly what the problem was and ask how many miles I had and he say sorry your your 2,000 miles over your warranty, I'm sorry I can't do anything for you. The owner of the shop say sorry I see this all the time with these Equinox and its ridiculous we just found out the gold one have the exact same issue. I'm writing to you because I did some research and this is a common issue with this model. I seen a lot of the rear main seal fail when the temperature drop and the water build up where the cover of the engine is and freeze inside and the seal don't hold.",

The diagnostic showed there was a seat belt problem and when they were removed you could see they were defective. When I returned the car I gave the service department the seat belts and to date, I have heard nothing.

I WAS DRIVING THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF 70 MPH AND WAS NOT USING CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE CAR ABRUPTLY SHIFTED INTO LOW GEAR, FLASHED A 'REDUCED POWER MODE' WARNING, AND WENT INTO A 'LIMP' MODE WHERE IT WAS SLOWING DOWN TO EVENTUALLY STOP ITSELF, BUT I WAS AT 40 OR 35 WHEN I PULLED OVER. THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON, AND THANK GOD NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME, I WASN'T IN CONSTRUCTION AND I HAD A SPOT I COULD SAFELY PULL OFF ONTO THE SHOULDER. I HAVE A 2017 CHEVY EQUINOX WITH ONLY 40,000 MILES ON IT. I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND SAT FOR 5 MINUTES OR SO. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, THE REDUCED POWER WARNING WAS GONE, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME AND CALLED THE DEALER, CHEVY WIND GAP, TO SEE IF I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED THERE OR IF I COULD DRIVE IT IN MYSELF. THEY TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A SENSOR MALFUNCTION, THAT IT SHOULD RESET ITSELF, AND THAT I COULD DRIVE IT THERE FOR THEM TO LOOK AT WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER A FEW DAYS, AND CHEVY WIND GAP WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY CURRENT CODE HISTORY OF THE REDUCED POWER MODE SO NOW I'M JUST DRIVING IN FEAR EVERY TIME I GET INTO THE THING THAT IT'S GOING TO DO THIS AGAIN AT ANY TIME. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE PASSENGERS FOR FEAR OF PUTTING THEM IN DANGER. IF THIS HAPPENED IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WITH A TRACTOR TRAILER ON MY BUMPER, IT COULD MAKE FOR A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE CHEVY EQUINOX, THIS IS THE 3RD ONE WE'VE BOUGHT, PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS OUT THERE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO BECAUSE THAT NUMBER IS GROWING EACH DAY.
