IT BEGAN TO HAPPEN ABOUT TWICE A MONTH. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN FIX THE ISSUE, BY RE-MAKING THE KEY AND PROGRAMMING THE NOW THE KEY WON'T TURN AT ALL. IN SHOPPING AROUND DEALERSHIPS THEY BELIEVE THE PRICE WILL BE AROUND $300 IF THE CYLINDER IS NOT DAMAGED (BY THEIR OWN KEY?) FOR $500, PLUS THE COST TO TOW THE VEHICLE TO THEM SO THEY CAN PROGRAM THE KEY.   A LOCAL LOCKSMITH HAS TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE FORD FOCUS.

IT WASN'T UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT WE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS RECALLED. I HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUEL MODULAR SYSTEM, PUMP AND FILTER. SO FAR THIS HAS RESOLVED THE ISSUE. NEEDLESS TO SAY OVER THE PAST YEAR OF HAVING THIS PROBLEM, I HAVE SPENT CLOSE TO $2000 IN REPAIRS FOR JUST THIS ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO HAD 2 WHEELS FALL OFF OF THE CAR DUE TO THE LOWER ARM CONTROL SNAPPING ONLY TO FIND OUT WHEN I HAD THOSE REPLACED THAT THE OTHER 2 WOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS SO OF COURSE I HAD TO REPLACE THOSE AS WELL. NEXT IS MY BRAKES TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE SQUEALING NOISE THEY ARE MAKING EVERYTIME I STOP THE CAR. I HAVE PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO THIS CAR AND I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS THAT THESE ARE NOT SAFETY RECALLS. HAVING THE CAR SHUT OFF WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY ON QUITE A FEW OCCASSIONS AND WHEELS FALLING OFF OF THE CAR IS VERY DANGEROUS, I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE AND THEN I HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THESE REPAIRS OUT OF MY POCKET WHICH IS JUST INSULT TO INJURY.

SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T GREASE THEM ENOUGH, I'M NOT SURE OF THE PROBLEM BUT FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE THIS PART OR AT LEAST GIVE A GOOD EXPLANATION OF WHY IT IS HAPPENING TO SO MANY FORD FOCUSES. THERE ARE AT LEAST 50 COMPLAINTS ON THIS ON A SITE CALLED FOCAL JET, WHICH WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME. PLEASE TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM. OTHER THAN THAT THE CAR HAS BEEN GREAT FOR THE DAUGHTER. *TR",

AN INTERNET SEARCH FOR \"FOCUS JAMMED DOOR\" OR \"FOCUS JAMMED DOOR LOCK\" RETURNS NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM, OCCURRING ON ALL FORD FOCUS DOORS INCLUDING TRUNK/HATCH. DRIVERS ENTER THEIR VEHICLES THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE OR EVEN THROUGH THE TRUNK BECAUSE SOME DOOR LOCKS ARE JAMMED DUE TO FAILED POWER LOCK ACTUATORS, WITH ALL SAFETY-RELATED HAZARDS AND CONSEQUENCES. THE JAMMING CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME; THERE IS NO WAY TO PREDICT IT AND TO TAKE PREVENTIVE MEASURES.

CONSEQUENCE:    THE WHEEL BEARINGS COULD PREMATURELY WEAR AND CAUSE A NOTICEABLE NOISE. IF NOT REPAIRED, THIS CONDITION COULD PROGRESS TO THE POINT WHERE THE WHEEL BEGINS TO WOBBLE.   REMEDY:    DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE REAR WHEEL BEARINGS AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER. ADDITIONAL BEARING SEALS WILL ALSO BE INSTALLED TO ENSURE A SMOOTH RIDE. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE IN EFFECT UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2002, REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE. EVEN IF THE VEHICLE HAS ALREADY BEEN SERVICED UNDER RECALL CAMPAIGN 00S31, FORD HAS TAKEN ADDITIONAL STEPS TO KEEP THE WHEEL BEARINGS IN TOP SHAPE.

I SEARCHED ONLINE TO SEE ABOUT A RECALL DUE TO THIS CARS HISTORY AND TO MY AMAZEMENT I FOUND WEB FORUM AFTER WEB FORUM OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SEARCH THE WEB FOR \"FORD FOCUS IGNITION LOCK\" AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN. THIS IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE AND CAN BE POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS. BEING STUCK AND UNABLE TO PUT YOUR CAR IN NEUTRAL AND MOVE IT TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT AND OUT OF THE WAY, BEING STUCK IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS...POSSIBLY WITH A CHILD OR EVEN JUST BEING STUCK FOR HOURS AT A TIME. I READ ON INSTANCE WERE A WOMEN WASN'T ABLE TO GET TOWED FOR 6 HOURS AND READ ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MAN WHO HAD RENTED A FOCUS ONLY TO HAVE IT LOCK UP WHILE AT A REST AREA ON THE HIGHWAY. IT APPEARS THAT FORD IS SIMPLY IGNORING THIS FAULT AND IT'S COSTING PEOPLE $400-$500 EVERY OCCURRENCE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO PAY TO HAVE IT REPLACED 3 TIMES OR MORE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS ISSUE.  3. I HAVE GET THE CAR TOWED TO A DEALER TO PAY THE $400 TO HAVE IT FIXED AND HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN OR I CAN FIND A LOCKSMITH WHO CAN COME TO MY HOUSE, DRILL OUT THE IGNITION AND REPLACE IT WHICH IS CHEAPER THAN THE DEALERSHIP BUT NOT BY MUCH.  *TR",

THE HUBCAPS HAVE CRACKED AND BROKEN OFF IN PIECES DURING COLD WEATHER WHILE PARKED (IE., THE HUBCAPS WERE NOT STRUCK BY EXOGENOUS ROCKS OR ANYTHING ELSE).

MY CAR IS ALMOST PAID OFF AND I WILL NOT INVEST MORE THAN WHAT IT IS WORTH, WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT $2,500.TOO BAD I HAVE PAID ABOUT $18,000 FOR IT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW WHY I HAVE NOT RECEIVED RECALLS FOR THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:    1. 1ST MONTH AFTER PURCHASE, ELECTRICAL SYSTEM RUNNING AIRBAGS, MIRRORS, DOORS ETC. FAILED.    2. 37,000 MILES- TRANSMISSION FAILED    3. 42,000 MILES- POWER DOOR LOCKS FAILED AND SOON AFTER PASSENGER DOORS STUCK IN THE LOCK POSITION.    4. ALL WINDOW TRACKS HAVE FAILED.    5. WHEEL BEARINGS REPLACED.    6. TRUNK LATCH FAILED    7. IGNITION FAILED AND WAS REPLACED AND IS GOING AGAIN.    8. BROUGHT IN FOR 1 RECALL (FUEL FILTER) AND STILL DIDN'T CORRECT PROBLEM WITH VIBRATION AND LURCHING.    THIS IS A VEHICLE THAT EXCEEDS HIGHWAY SAFTEY RATINGS? SOMETHING WILL BE DONE ABOUT THIS IF I MUST HIRE AN ATTORNEY- I AM OUT A LOT OF MONEY AND NO VEHICLE.  *TR",

THE WHEELS WERE SLIGHTLY TURNED TO THE LEFT AND THE KEY WOULD NOT TURN FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS IN THE IGNITION SO I BEGAN WIGGLING THE STEERING WHEEL BACK AND FORTH, CONTINUING TO TRY THE KEY.  EVENTUALLY, I'D TURNED THE WHEEL SO FAR THAT IT STUCK IN THE LOCK POSITION, CRANKED TO ONE DIRECTION.  NOTHING WORKED.  A HALF HOUR PASSED.  I ASSUMED THAT THE DIRECTION OF WHEELS AND THE STEERING WHEEL BEING TURNED LIKE IT WAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE IGNITION NOT WORKING.  SO I JACKED UP THE FRONT END OF THE CAR TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN MY WHEELS OUT BY HAND BUT THEY TOO WERE LOCKED AND WERE NOT GOING TO BUDGE.  I CONTINUED TO TRY DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF APPLYING THE BRAKE, TRYING TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL, ADJUSTING THE TILT OF THE STEERING WHEEL COLUMN, AND TRYING TO TURN THE KEY.  I CALLED A TAXI CAB TO TAKE ME BACK TO WORK, 25 MINUTES LATE, MINUS 7 DOLLARS.  AT WORK, I BEGAN TO RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND WEBSITES, SUCH AS CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/AUTOMOTIVE/FORD_FOCUS, WHERE I BEGAN TO LEARN TIPS TO GET THE KEY TO TURN AND SUGGESTIONS FOR REPAIR.  I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A TOW TRUCK FEE BY USING ONE OF THE SUGGESTED QUICK FIXES, WHICH BASICALLY CONSISTS OF POUNDING THE KEY INTO THE IGNITION WITH A HAMMER, PREFERABLY A RUMMER MALLOT.  FROM THAT SAME SITE, I LEARNED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN PINPOINTED TO THE GERMAN-MADE HUF LOCK THAT FORD PUTS IN THE FORD FOCUS.  THE BEST SUGGESTION IS TO HAVE AN AUTOMOTIVE LOCKSMITH REPLACE IT WITH A NON-FORD OR NON-HUF PART.  GOING TO A FORD DEALER IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.  THE PART HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED SO IT COSTS THE CONSUMER.  FOR ME, AROUND $400.  *NM",

I HAD BEEN PULLING OUT INTO HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN CAR JUST DIED.. EVERYTHING WENT DEAD.  TONIGHT MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I STARTED SEARCHING THE NET LOOKING FOR REASONS WHY WHEN I CAME ACROSS THE STALLING ISSUES WITH THE FORD FOCUS 2000.   I HAVE ALSO ENCOUNTERED MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR OVER THE YEARS AND UNTIL RECENTLY HAVE STAYED UNDER 50,000 MILES.  I ALSO HAD THE LOCKING OF THE IGNITION WHICH WAS REPLACED BY THE DEALING BUT LAST TIME I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE REAR BEARINGS THEY TOLD ME MY CAR WAS NOT ONE OF THE 21 STATES IT HAD ISSUES WITH.  I SEE THEY HAVE NOW INCLUDED THAT TO GO INTO ALL 50 STATES.   AT THIS POINT I AM REALLY SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR ANYMORE AND WAS JUST GETTING READY TO DO AN OUT OF STATE DRIVE WHICH I AM PUTTING ON HOLD.  I'VE HAD OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE CAR STALLING OUT IN TRAFFIC.. IT JUST STOPS.. STEERING FREEZES BRAKES LOCK.. ITS  A MESS AND A DANGER TO MY CHILD'S LIFE AND MINE.  THE LATEST PROBLEM OF STALLING PLUS THE GAS PRESSURE SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE.. I PRESS ON THE GAS AND IT SEEMS TO SPUTTER AS IF THE CAR WASN'T GETTING ENOUGH GAS AND ALMOST DIES.. I THOUGHT MAYBE MY CLUTCH WAS GOING OUT BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN A CAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT THANK GOODNESS BUT HAVE COME VERY CLOSE.

THERE WERE MULTIPLE WIRES WHICH WERE DAMAGED AND NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED.  THIS WAS ALL BECAUSE OF THE DEFECT IN THE DECK LID WIRE HARNESS.

WE HAVE CALLED FORD AND ALSO SPOKE TO OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY ARE TELLING US THAT OUR CAR DOES NOT HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT.  IT IS VERY OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WHO WOULD SEE THE REAR DECK LID THAT THERE IS A VERY CLEAR DEFECT.  THE WIRES ARE FRAYED AND MELTED TOGETHER.  THE GENTLEMAN WHO REPAIRED OUR CAR SAID THIS IS DEFINITELY THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE WIRES ON THE DECK LID ARE STILL NEED OF REPAIR AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO THE BEND AREA TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

I LOOKED INTO GETTING IT FIXED AND FOUND SEVERAL WEBSITES WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP I CALLED FOR SERVICE SAID IT WOULD BE ROUGHLY AROUND $280 TO FIX BUT COULDN'T QUOTE UNTIL THE CAR HAD BEEN IN FOR INSPECTION.  I AM REALLY UPSET WITH FORD FOR NOT RECALLING THIS ITEM YEARS AGO.  IT IS SUCH A SMALL FIX FOR THEM BUT COSTS US ALOT.  THEN WHEN YOU GET THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR YOU RECALL, THEY TRY TO ELIMINATE THE LABOR COSTS, BUT ISN'T THAT PART OF THE RECALL.

NOTHING WAS THERE, SO I PAID OVER $300.00 OUT OF POCKET FOR THE REPAIR.  NOW, I SEE CARS LIKE MINE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE SPRINGS, AND THAT FORD IS COVERING THESE KIND OF REPAIRS FOR TEN YEARS OR 150,000 MILES. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHEN I PAID FOR THE REPAIR. I WANT REIMBURSEMENT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FORD MOTOR COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGE THIS SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM THROUGH A RECALL RATHER THAN A SERVICE BULLETIN.  I CALLED FORD JUST TODAY, AND THE SERVICE PERSON SAID TO TAKE ORIGINAL REPAIR BILLS TO MY DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER FOR REVIEW. THE DEALER IS SUPPOSED TO SEND THEM TO FORD WHERE A REIMBURSEMENT DECISION WILL BE MADE. THIS CONCERNS ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IN THE WORLD THIS OBVIOUS SAFETY MATTER HAS NOT BEEN MADE A RECALLED ITEM. I DIDN'T KNOW THE SPRINGS WERE BROKEN UNTIL THE MECHANIC TOLD ME.

ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CAR LOST POWER & DIED IN A BUSY INTERSECTION.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THE BATTERY.  SO I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE & TRIED STARTING IT AGAIN - IT CONTINUED TO NOT START BACK UP;  HOWEVER, WE STARTED SMELLING GAS & WE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR DUE TO TRAFFIC ALL AROUND US.  FINALLY A POLICE OFFICER CAME & ASKED US TO IMMEDIATELY GET OUT OF THE CAR - THERE WAS GAS POURING OUT ALL OVER THE ROAD.  IT APPEARED THAT THE FUEL PUMP WAS MALFUNCTIONING.    IN DECEMBER 2003 I HAD THE RECALL OF THE FUEL PUMP REPLACED AT THE DEALERSHIP.  HOWEVER, THE POLICE OFFICER INDICATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE THE FUEL PUMP BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU TURNED THE IGNITION - GAS STARTED POURING OUT.  I HAD MY CAR TOWED AT MY EXPENSE OF $84.00 TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I ALSO LOST A FULL TANK OF GAS WHICH COST ME $17.00.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP & THEY DIRECTED ME TO FORD CUSTMER RELATIONS.  I SPOKE WITH AN ANTHONY ON 08/30/04 @ 7:22AM (CST).  HE INDICATED THAT THE FUEL PUMP COULD BE REPLACED AGAIN THAT IT WAS A WARRANTY BY FORD.  HOWEVER, WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE OTHER EXPENSES OF TOWING, RENTAL CAR (CURRENTLY WITHOUT A CAR & CANNOT GO TO WORK) , REPLACEMENT OF GAS LOST - HE SAID FORD DOES NOT HAVE ANY WAY OF REIMBURSING THESE.      THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON INDICATED THAT WAS NOTHING THAT FORD COULD DO ABOUT THIS.    MY GREAT CONCERN IS THAT MY SON & I INHALED A LOT OF GAS FUMES - WE COULD HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP IN THE CAR (ACCORDING TO THE POLICE OFFICER) - AND FORD IS NOT BE HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER AT ALL.    I FEEL THAT THE 2000 FORD FOCUS IS NOT A SAFE CAR TO DRIVE.  PLUS I THERE IS ANOTHER RECALL FOR THE COIL ON THE CAR & YOU CAN'T GET THIS REPLACED BECAUSE THE COILS WILL NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL DECEMBER 2004.

MY DAUGHTER WHO IS EIGHT MONTH PREGNANT HAD TO CRAWL OVER TO THE PASSENGER SIDE TO BE ABLE TO EXIT THE VEHICLE (IN 96 DEGREES WEATHER).  QUITE A CHORE IN A SMALL CAR LIKE THIS.   THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO FIX THIS UNDER WARRANTY AND EXPECTS ME TO PAY $574.00 FOR THE REPAIR.

IN MY 30+ YEARS OF DRIVING I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING TO ANY OF THE  CARS I HAVE BEEN DRIVING.      FIRST OF ALL - IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND IT IS THE MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSIBILITY.  EVEN IF THE REMOTE ACCESS FAILS, ONE SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR MANUALLY.  THE KEY WILL TURN COUNTER-CLOCKWISE TO THE 10 O'CLOCK POSITION AND CLOCKWISE TO THE 1 O'CLOCK POSITION.   I CALLED THE  FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND WAS BRUSHED OFF (OUT OF WARRANTY).  ALSO,THE FORD REPRESENTATIVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FORD DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY HAZARD. I ASKED FOR THE NAME OF THE MANUFACTURER OF THE DOOR ACTIVATOR AND WAS DENIED THIS INFORMATION.  THEN I ASKED TO TALK TO THE NEXT PERSON IN THE SUPERVISORY CHAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT I COULD NOT TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.

THE CAR BURNED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND THE FRONT PASSENGER AREA COMPLETELY WITHIN 15 MINUTES.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT IT STARTED IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  SECURITY SAID FROM THEIR VIDEO THAT IT ALSO SHOWED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE ENGINE.  THE FLAMES SHOT UP OVER 10 FEET WITHIN MINUTES OF THE FIRE BEING NOTICED.  WHEN THE CAR WAS PURCHASED I REFUSED TO BUY IT WITHOUT A WARRANTY SO THE DEALERSHIP GAVE US A 12 MONTH OR 12,000 MILE WARRANTY (AND WE PURCHASED THE EXTENDED) BUT NOW THEY ARE SAYING THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF ANYTHING BUT THE EASYCARE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WE PURCHASED.  WE FIND THIS STRANGE SINCE WE HAVE HAD 2 \"WARRANTY\" REPAIRS AT NO CHARGE SINCE THE PURCHASE AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION BEFORE.  THE INSURANCE COMPNAY HAS ASKED THAT WE GO TALK TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS EVENING ONE MORE TIME TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT BEFORE THEY PAY IT AND WE LOOSE MONEY AS WELL AS HAVING OUR PREMIUMS GO UP.  ONE OF MY OTHER BIG CONCERNS IS THAT OUR OTHER VEHICLE IS ALSO A FORD AND IT HAS DEPRECIATED BY SOME 10,000 DOLLARS SINCE WE PURCHASED IT IN JUNE OF 03 NEW SO WE CANNOT TRADE IT IN ANYWHERE OR SELL IT WITHOUT BEING SO UPSIDE DOWN AS TO HURT OURSELVES.  I PERSONALLY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONFIDENCE IN FORD AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN.

(PARTS AND LABOR) I COULD NOT AFFORD IT AND TOOK IT OUT OF THEIR SHOP, I THEN BROUGHT IT IN AFTER THE RECALL AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE FUEL PUMP WAS NOT THE PROBLEM THAT IT WAS THE COIL AND THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP SINCE IT WAS NOT FAILING. I THEN FOUGHT IT OUT WITH THEM AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP WHEN IT CAME IN STOCK LATE JANUARY 2004. THEY DID REPLACE THE COILS AND THE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT WAS ON WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN AND THAT IS HOW THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS THE COILS.

I WAS PLEASED WITH THE CAR, NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITHIN THE 2 YEARS I HAD IT ONLY THE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.  FEB 28TH 2000 I MADE THE STUPIDEST DECISION IN MY LIFE TO TRADE IT FOR A BRAND NEW FOCUS 2000 -I WAS IMPRESSED OF THE REVIEWS OF BEING THE EUROPEAN CAR OF THE YEAR IN 1999.    WELL DURING THIS 3 YEARS I HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE AND I JUST RECEIVED ANOTHER SAFETY RECALL. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES I'VE TAKEN MY CAR BACK TO FORD FOR SAFETY RECALLS DURING THE LAST 3 YEARS.  IN 3 YEARS I HAD TO REPLACE BRAKES 3 TIMES (THAT'S ACTUALLY ONCE A YEAR) REPLACE ROTORS TWICE SOMETHING GOT MESSED UP LAST AUGUST WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THE STARTER I HAD TO HAVE THAT FIXED.  THERE'S ALWAYS NOISE WITH THE BRAKES, I ASKED SEVERAL TIMES AND ALL YOUR STAFF OR THE ONE ON 75 CAN TELL ME IS A &#34;KNOWN PROBLEM&#34; FIRST IT WAS &#34;METAL BRAKES&#34; NO PROBLEM THAT'S NORMAL AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS YOU CHANGED IT TO A &#34;KNOWN PROBLEM&#34;???

WRONG ! THE VEHICLE ALWAYS HAD HORRENDOUS BRAKE DUST BUT THE WORST WAS YET TO COME. IN DECEMBER 2002, MY HUSBAND AND I WERE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING AND BEGAN TO NOTICE A ROUGH IDLE. WELL, IT'S COLD IN BUFFALO, NY SO WE THOUGHT IT JUST NEEDED MORE TIME TO WARM UP. BY EARLY MARCH WE EXPERIENCED STALLING PROBLEMS AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. AFTER STALLING AT 45MPH WE HAD ENOUGH. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO BASIL FORD. WITH ONLY 32,000 MILES ON IT WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE CYLINDER HEAD WAS CRACKED AND THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY RAN OUT ON 1/29/03. FORD WANTED ABOUT $1,700.00 TO REPLACE IT. WELL, WE THOUGHT IF FORD WOULDN'T COVER THE REPAIR THAT THE API EXTENDED WARRANTY WOULD. ANOTHER ERROR IN JUDGMENT ! API SAID THERE WAS CARBON IN THE CYLINDER AND THEY WOULDN'T COVER. FINALLY, AFTER THREATS TO LEAVE THE CAR AT THE DEALER OR SEEK LEGAL ADVICE TO REMEDY, BASIL REPLACED THE CYLINDER HEAD FOR $400.00. WHO EVER HEARD OF A CRACKED HEAD AT 32,000 MILES ? WE HAD ONLY PUT ABOUT 10,000 MILES ON IT ! ALSO THE KEYLESS ENTRY ON THE DRIVER DOOR WOULD ONLY WORK ON OCCASION AND THE KEY NEVER DID WORK ON THE TRUNK (TOLD THE LOCK NEEDED REPLACEMENT) WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IF WE WANTED FIXED. SINCE THE INSPECTION WAS COMING UP IN JUNE 2003 AND THE BRAKES AND ROTORS WOULD PROBABLY NEED REPLACEMENT JUST LIKE ALL FOCUS'S DO, WE TRADED IN THE CAR TO AVOID THE MONEY TRAP. THAT CAR WAS THE WORST HUNK OF JUNK I'VE EVER HEARD OF! I PAID $10,500.00 FOR THE CAR IN JUNE 2001 WITH 23,000 MILES ON IT AND HAD A HARD TIME GETTING $5,000.00 AS A TRADE WITH 33,000 MILES IN MAY 2003 !

I WAS THROWN FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE TO THE PASSENGER'S SIDE OF THE CAR, THE CAR FILLED WITH SMOKE AND I WAS &#34;MOVED&#34; ACROSS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC TO LAND IN A SHALLOW DITCH JUST EAST OF THE SANTA RITA ROAD EXIT.

GARY RIGGS (SERVICE MANAGER AT STAN MORRI FORD) ASKED ME TO COME IN.  OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS, STAN MORRI FORD (IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORD CORPORATE) HAS INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE.

I WAS ABLE TO RESTART, AND LIMPED INTO THE NEAREST TOWN AND FOUND A FORD DEALER IN ASHTABULA OH. HE SAID IT WAS THE FUEL FILTER AND REPAIRED IT. IT DROVE FINE FOR THE REST OF JOURNEY INTO CLEVELAND. BUT I THEN HEADED TO NEW YORK CITY A FEW DAYS LATER, AND AGAIN AFTER 200 MILES, IT STARTED SPUTTERING ON HILLS. THEN OUTSIDE OF BINGHAMTON, NY IT STALLED AGAIN. I AGAIN RESTARTED, AND TERRIFIED OF A FATAL ACCIDENT, I CALLED FOR ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE FROM VERIZON WIRELESS. THEY GOT A TOW TRUCK TO GET ME TO A GARAGE, BUT THEY WERE CLOSED. THE NEXT MORNING, I WAITED FOR THEM TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND REPAIR THE CAR, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE STALLING PROBLEM. I DROVE THE REST OF THE WAY INTO NEW YORK CITY TERRIFIED, AND ALMOST STALLED OUT AT THE FOOT FO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. IT WAS AFTER 5:00 PM SO THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSED THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM. SO I AM PLANNING TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT. BUT THEY SAID THAT UNLESS THEY CAN SEE THE PROBLEM, THEY CAN'T FIX IT. I ALSO CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM. WHICH I LATER FOUND OUT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR, AND THERE IS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY AT NHTSA.

SEVERAL WEEKS LATER MY BATTERY LIGHT COMES ON, I TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY TELL ME IT'S MY FAULT AND NOW THE ALTERNATOR WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THE FRAYED POSITIVE CABLE WHICH IS BURNT COMPLETELY IS NOT THEIR FAULT. THEY TELL ME THAT THEY WILL NOT FIX THE BATTERY CABLES UNLESS I PAY 390.00 TO HAVE THE ALTERNATOR FIXED. THESE ISSUES WITH MY CAR ARE AS A DIRECT RESULT FROM THIS BATTERY CABLE ISSUE.  THERE ARE ALSO STILL MANY OTHER ISSUES WITH THIS CAR INCLUDING A LEAK WHICH THEY THINK MEANS THE CAR IS ACTUALLY CRACKED IN HALF. THE SERVICE ADVISOR VERBALLY ATTACKS ME AND GIVES ME THE FINGER AND TELLS ME TO TALK TO THE HAND. THE SERVICE MANAGER STEPS IN AND DOES NOTHING TO HELP ME. IN THE MEANTIME I ALL I WANTED WAS THE CABLES REPLACED AS IT IS STATED IN THE RECALL. SO I CAN DUMP THE PIECE OF CRAP.   *LA",

SO I ASKED THEM WHAT I CAN DO... THEY SAID I HAVE TO TOWED THE CAR THERE AND TO CHECK AND FIX IT IS AROUND 400 DOLLARS.  MY COMPLAIN IS BECAUSE I THINK IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR A WOMAN TO HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM.  THE SYSTEMS IN THEIR CARS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE ALONE AND YOU LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE IN A PARKING LOT SAID AT NIGHT AND YOU COMEBACK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IF IT IS COMPLETE LOCK?  YOU CAN BE RAPED IF YOU ARE ALONE LATE IN A DARK SPOT OR ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO YOU...  NOW IF FORD KNOWS THIS KIND THE CARS HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHY THEY DO NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ? THEY CAN RECALL THE CARS.     PLEASE HELP ME BECAUSE I THINK IS NOT FEAR I HAVE TO PAY 400 DOLLAR FOR A  CAR DEFECT  AND ALSO BECAUSE MY WARRANTY IS OVER.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELP.

EARLIER THIS AUTUMN AN AMBER DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AS I WAS DRIVING. AT FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO DECODE ITS MEANING FROM VEHICLE'S MANUAL, I LEARNED IT WAS THE 'AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE/COOLING' WARNING LIGHT ON ZTEC EQUIPPED MODELS (LIKE MINE). I TOOK IT TO LINCOLN MERCURY DEAL (WHERE I HAVE HAD MY FOCUS REPAIRED OFTEN): 'BARON LINCOLN MERCURY' IN FLUSHING, NEW YORK WHERE THEY PERFORMED A COMPUTERIZED CHECK OF SYMPTOMS. I WAS TOLD SERVICE WRITER THERE WERE 'CODES' WHICH INDICATED SOLENOID AND GEAR RATIO PROBLEMS IN 2ND AND 4TH. I WASN'T SURE WHAT ALL THAT MEANT BUT SEEMED LIKE GOOD IDEA TO TAKE ADVICE AND SCHEDULE ANOTHER MORE DETAILED INSPECTION FOR POSSIBLE REPAIRS; THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY WAS AROUND 10 DAYS FROM THAT DAY AND I TOOK IT. I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE LIGHT HAD NOT CONTINUED TO REMAIN 'ON' FOLLOWING THE 1ST TIME. I TOOK MY CAR TO BARON ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND ON MONDAY FOLLOWING IT, I SAW SAME LIGHT TO COME 'ON. THAT DAY I CALLED LOCAL AAMCO DEALER AND AGREED TO HAVE CAR LOOKED AT THERE THE NEXT MORNING WHERE THEIR COMPUTER FOUND SAME THING. I AGREED TO LET AAMCO OPEN UP TRANSMISSION FOR DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP AND THAT AFTERNOON WAS TOLD THAT NEEDED REPAIRS TOTALLING APPROXIMATELY $2700. I AGREED TO LET AAMCO PERFORM WORK AFTER HAVING FIRST CONTACTED THE SAME SERVICE WRITER AT BARON LINCOLN-MERCURY WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY VERY SELDOM DID TRANSMISSION WORK AND THAT IF THEY DID IT'D COST AROUND $2700. SINCE AAMCO'S SPECIALTY IS TRANSMISSIONS, IT MADE SENSE TO PROCEED.  I AM A TWO TIME FORD CUSTOMER ('96 AND '2000) AND WON'T PERMIT THE IDEA OF BUYING ANOTHER TO CROSS MY MIND.   *LA",

WHEN ENGINE GOES INTO SLOW-IDLING STATE, ENGINE IDLES VERY ERRATICALLY AND IS NOT SMOOTH. SOUNDS LIKE ONLY SOME OF CYLINDERS ARE FIRING. THIS HAS ONLY STARTED TO OCCUR TODAY AND SINCE READING COMMENTS ON THIS WEBSITE, I'M CONCERNED. HAVE TRIED ADDING FUEL-INJECTOR-CLEANER TO FUEL TANK, AWAITING RESULTS OF THAT.  THE TRUNK WOULD NOT CLOSE. THE PROBLEM HERE WAS FIXED BY REMOVING THE LOCKING ASSEMBLY FROM THE TRUNK-LID AND SIMPLY DOWSING THE MECHANISMS WITH WD40 AND THEN BENDING SOME SPRING-LOADED COMPONENTS..  THERE ARE 2 MOVING COMPONENTS IN THE LOCK. FIRST IS SHAPE OF A LOOP THAT YOU CAN EASILY MOVE WITH FINGER/SCREWDRIVER. THIS COMPONENT LOCKS ONTO STUB THAT YOU CAN SEE WHEN OPENING TRUNK.  THE OTHER COMPONENT IS HIDDEN WITHIN CASING AND MOVES IN FRONT OF OTHER COMPONENT TO HOLD IT IN A LOCKED POSITION. PROBLEM WAS WITH THIS COMPONENT. PROBLEM WAS COMPONENT HAD \"SOMEHOW\" GOTTEN BENT AND NOT FREE TO LEAVE CASING AND BLOCK OTHER COMPONENT. BENDING THIS TO A POSITION FREEING IT OF CASING FIXED PROBLEM.  ENGINE LACKED POWER WHEN UNDER LOAD WHEN ACCELERATING, VEHICLE WOULD SHUDDER AND DECELERATE INSTEAD OF ACCELERATE.

WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICER THAT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE WEATHER HAD RECENTLY GOTTEN HOT AND IT \"SHOCKED\" THE CAR. KEY WOULDN'T ENTER THE IGNITION. HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO SERVICER. CAR SHUTS OFF IF UNDER HALF A TANK. SERVICER TOLD ME \" KEEP THE GAS OVER HALF A TANK\". SOMETIMES I SMELL SOMETHING BURNING WHILE HEAT ON IN CAR. ON 2 OCCASSIONS SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE VENTS WHILE A/C ON ( DIDN'T TAKE TO SERVICER FOR THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY NEVER OCCURED AGAIN). TODAY 11/10/03 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR STARTED SHAKING AND STALLING EVENTUALLY CUTTING OFF. TOOK TO THE SERVICER AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM, WITHOUT EVEN MENTIONING THE MAKE AND MODEL OF MY CAR THE TECHNICIAN SAID, \" YOU MUST HAVE A FOCUS\". NO LONGER UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY AND CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR THESE DEFECTS THAT FORD IS VERY MUCH AWARE OF. ALSO, THE CAR NO LONGER HAS VALUE. TRIED TO TRADE IT IN BEFORE FACTORY WARRANTY RAN OUT LAST YEAR, AND WAS TOLD  CAR ONLY WORTH $4,000 WHILE I STILL OWED $10,000, WHICH MEANS I WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP WITH THE $6,000 DIFFERENCE TO BE FREE FROM THE CAR. THE CAR WAS ONLY 2 YRS OLD WHEN I TRIED TO TRADE IT IN! SO, I FEEL I GOT RIPPED OFF WITH A LEMON THAT I CAN'T EVEN GET RID OF.

SHE THEN HAD TO CALL A TOW COMPANY AND HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO SKYLINE FORD IN SALEM OREGON.  SHE WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAVE BEEN QUIET A FEW FOCUS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE TECH KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  WE WERE 100 MILES OVER THE FACTORY WARRANTY!!  WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE FAULTY PART.  THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST.  WE WENT TO GET ICE CREAM.  THE CAR STALLED AS WE WERE LEAVING THE ICE CREAM STORE.  THE CAR WOULD NOT START.  IT FINALLY STARTED AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  WE WERE ONLY ABOUT 10 MINUTES FROM HOME.

WE CALLED SKYLINE, WHO COULD NOT GET US IN UNTIL SATURDAY.  IT WAS 3 OR 4 DAYS.  NOW WE ARE TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO PAY $120 FOR A FAULTY PART!!  THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS CAR FOR FAULTY BATTERY CABLES.  WE ARE TOLD THAT IF FORD DECIDES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ACTUAL CABLE, THEN WE WILL BE REFUNDED THE $120.  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!!

SYMPTOMS INCLUDED THE CAR LURCHING IN HIGHER RPMS (NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN SPEED) AND EVENTUALLY THE CAR WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN 55 MPH AND STALLED ON THE EXPRESSWAY.  IT STARTED UP HALF AN HOUR LATER, AND I WAS ABLE TO LIMP HOME AT 50 MPH ON THE E-WAY.    THAT PROBLEM DISAPPEARED AFTER A WEEK, AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF COMING BACK UNTIL THE NEXT TIME I MADE A LONG CAR TRIP, WHEN IT DID THE SAME THING, BUT THANKFULLY DID NOT STALL.  THE CAR CONTINUED TO DO THIS, AND FORD DEALERS NEVER DID FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, ALTHOUGH ONE DEALER CHARGED ME $400 TO DRAIN AND CLEAN THE TANK BECAUSE OF DEBRIS IN THE TANK CAUSING THE CAR TO STALL ON RIGHT TURNS.  IF NOT FOR THE FOCALJET.COM WEBSITE, I WOULD BE STUCK WITH AN OUT-OF-WARRANTY DEFECTIVE CAR THAT FORD FLATLY REFUSED TO COVER DURING THE WARRANTY, BUT WAS HAPPY TO SPLIT THE COST 50-50 ONE DAY AFTER THE WARRANTY ENDED.  AFTER MAKING ANOTHER LONG TRIP AND HAVING THE CAR SPUTTERING AT 4000 RPMS, I DROPPED THE FUEL TANK, REMOVED 2 CLOGGED FILTERS FROM INSIDE THE GAS TANK FUEL-SENDING UNIT, AND THE CAR HAS WORKED PERFECTLY SINCE THEN.  I NOW HAVE MORE POWER, SMOOTHER POWER DELIVERY, NO STALLING OR STUMBLING ON THE E-WAY OR ON RIGHT-HAND TURNS, AND THE CAR NO LONGER HESITATES WITH THE A/C ON.  THESE CLOGGED FILTERS HAVE COST ME COUNTLESS HOURS, TRIPS TO THE DEALER, AND $400 WHEN THE FIX IS JUST TO LET THE EXTERNAL (AND USER-SERVICEABLE) FUEL FILTER DO ITS JOB.

THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TOLD ME THAT ONE CONSUMER WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM LEAVES HIS KEY IN THE IGNITION, THINKING THAT IF THE CAR GETS STOLEN THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  HE SAID THAT ANOTHER CONSUMER HAS A HAMMER IN HIS CAR WHICH HE USES TO TAP THE KEY BEFORE TURNING IT.

I WAS ABLE TO ROLL SAFELY A FEW FEET AWAY TO A SMALL SHOULDER AREA. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAITED A SECOND BEFORE STARTING IT AGAIN. IT STARTED RIGHT UP WITH NO PROBLEM.  ALSO A FEW WEEKS EARLIER THE CAR WOULDN'T START ONE MORNING. I HAD IT TOWED TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER, WHO SAID IT SIMPLY NEEDED TRANSMISSION FLUID, THEY ADDED IT AND IT STARTED UP.  BUT IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS IS WHEN IT BEGAN HESITATING ON CURVES AND FEELING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO CUT OFF.  BUT IT HAD HAPPENED ONCE PRIOR TO THAT, IT HESITATED AFTER THE CURVE AND WOULDN'T ACCELERATE EVEN THOUGH I WAS STEPPING ON THE GAS. WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO FORD, THEY DID A FULL INSPECTION AND TOLD ME I NEEDED A NEW FUEL DELIVERY MODULE, A NEW FUEL FILTER AND INJECTION CLEANING (THE LATTER 2 BEING REGULAR MAINTENANCE).  BUT THIS FUEL DELIVERY MODULE WAS MAJOR. AND MY EXTENDED WARRANTY (NOT THROUGH FORD, BUT WITH GM MAJOR GUARD) ALMOST DIDN'T COVER IT, BUT DECIDED TO COVER MOST OF IT.  THE FORD DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE FUEL DELIVERY MODULE GOING BAD WAS JUST BASIC WEAR AND TEAR OVER TIME.

I WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK OUT ANY BUGS YOU MAY HAVE.  OR, SHOULD I CALL THEM RECALLS.  I THINK A CAR THAT HAS 16 RECALLS, MOST OF THEM WHICH I WOULD CONSIDER SAFETY ISSUES, SHOULD BE RECALLED ENTIRELY.  I HAVE HAD OTHER ISSUES WITH THIS CAR AS WELL.  MY KEY WOULD NOT TURN, SEAT BELTS LOCKING FOR NO REASON, DOOR HANDLES NOT OPENING THE DOOR (THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AGAIN).  AND ONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED, BRAKES.  I AM NOW ON MY THIRD SET OF FRONT ROTORS SINCE I HAVE PURCHASED THE CAR.  THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED EVERY TIME.  THE DRIVER SIDE ROTOR AND PAD WILL WEAR COMPLETELY DOWN YET THE PASSENGER SIDE WILL BE JUST FINE.  I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER FOCUS OWNERS AND THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING.  I STILL HAVE MY LAST SET OF ROTORS JUST TO PROVE IT.  I GOT SMART THIS TIME AND BOUGHT REPLACEMENTS THAT WERE NOT MADE BY YOU.  STOP TECH CROSS DRILLED ROTORS AND EBC GREENSTUFF KEVLAR PADS.  I ALSO REPLACED THE DRIVER SIDE CALIPER WITH A NON-FORD REPLACEMENT.      I WANT OUT OF THIS CAR BECAUSE I FEEL IT IS UNSAFE.  I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO WARN OTHER FOCUS OWNERS THAT THIS CAR IS UNSAFE.  YOU ALSO HAD BETTER NOT SEND ME TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN.  WHAT DOES THE DEALERSHIP HAVE TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF AN UNSAFE CAR?  NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT THEY SELL IT.   I AM NOT PUTTING UP WITH FORD PUSHING ME AROUND OR GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND EITHER.  THIS CAR IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND SHOULD NOT BE ON THE ROAD.      I DID NOT DO THIS BEFORE BUT THIS TIME YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.  THIS LETTER WILL BE SENT TO AS MANY BAD PRODUCT WEBSITES AS I CAN FIND.  IT WILL ALSO BE SENT TO NHTSA, CONSUMER REPORTS AND THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  YOU DID NOT DO ANYTHING WITH MY PREVIOUS COMPLAINT AND NOW THERE ARE MORE ISSUES WITH THIS PRODUCT THAT NOT ONLY CONCERN SAFETY, BUT THE LIFE OF THE CAR.  SOMETHING WILL BE DONE.*JB",

SECOND PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED WHILE IDLING I NOTICED THE FAN WAS NOT TURNING ON TO COOL THE ENGINE DOWN- I BROUGHT CAR TO DEALER IN JANUARY OF 2002 WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FAN RELAY SWITCH WHICH WAS REPLACED TO MY SATISFACTION. NO FURTHER PROBLEMS HAVE SURFACED WITH COOLING SYSTEM. THIRDLY AND MOST TROUBLING IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. I HAD NOTICED THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING IN EARLY 2002 (JAN) AND HAD THE DEALER LOOK AT IT- THEY TOLD ME THE FLUID LEVEL WAS LOW AND ADDED A QUART AND TEST DROVE - IMMEDIATE AFTERWARDS CHANGED GEARS GREAT - AS TIME WENT ON I NOTICED IT AGAIN- I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER- BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT THE CAR STARTED WORSENING UNTIL COMPLETE TRANSMISIION FAILURE OCCURED. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALER WHER IT WAS WORKED ON FOR ABOUT 3-5 DAYS - A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INSTALLED (4/2002). 2000 MILES LATER AND 4 MONTHS SAME PROBLEM SURFACING AGAIN!! I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE MORNING HOPEFULLY THE PROBLEM WILL BE ADDRESSED. I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS A SAFETY CONCERN AND AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN- SO FAR I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO ESCAPE INJURY OR DEATH. THERE ARE OVER 60 INCIDENT REPORTS LISTED ON NHTSA 'S WEB SITE FOR TRANSMISSION FAILURES AND I BELIEVE SOMEONE NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER FURTHER.

ALIGNMENT WAS EVEN SET OUT OF SPEC. BY FRIENDSHIP FORD (BRISTOL TN) TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM OF SEVERE TIRE WEAR.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IF A VEHICLE HAS TO BE SET OUT OF SPEC. TO CORRECT A PROBLEM, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.  WE WERE TOLD HOWEVER, BY RUSTY WALLACE FORD (NEWPORT TN) THAT OUR DRIVING HABITS WERE JUST TOO ROUGH AND THEY PROCEDED TO TELL ME HOW TO DRIVE.  I DO NOT RACE THE CAR OR DRIVE LIKE A MANIAC AND SHOULDNT HAVE TO DRIVE 25MPH TO AVOID REPLACING TIRES EVERY 20000 MILES.  I HAVE SINCE HAD TO REPLACE THE LEFT REAR WHEEL BEARING THAT LOCKED UP ALSO RUINING THE SPINDLE, AND REAR BRAKE PADS DUE TO THE BRAKES ON THE LEFT REAR WHEEL LOCKING UP.  IT SEEMS SORT OF QUESTIONABLE TO ME THAT I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE OUT OF THAT ONE WHEEL, THE SAME ONE THAT WAS RECALLED DUE TO THE SLIGHT PROBLEM OF IT COMING OFF THE CAR.  MY MOTHER AND I OWN AN INVENTORY SERVICE AND DRIVE THE CAR AS MANY AS 3000 MILES A MONTH AND SOMETIMES MORE, SO OUR WARRANTY WAS USED UP QUICKLY AND ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS OTHER THAN THE TIRES HAVE COME AFTER THE WARRANTY ENDED.

I REALIZE THERE IS ALREADY AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THIS, I JUST WANTED TO ADD ANOTHER TESTIMONY. WHEN THE FUEL TANK IS LESS THAN HALF FULL, AND THE CAR TAKES RIGHT-TURNS, ESPECIALLY LONG, SWEEPING TURNS, SUCH AS HIGHWAY ENTRANCE/EXIT RAMPS, THE CAR WILL JERK AND LURCH VIOLENTLY, REFUSING TO ACCELERATE, AND WILL STALL IF PROVOKED ENOUGH.  IF I BACK OFF THE GAS, IT RECOVERS, BUT TWICE IT HAS COMPLETELY STALLED OUT, REFUSING TO TURN BACK ON FOR A FEW HOURS, ONE OF THESE TIMES WAS IN HEAVY HIGHWAY TRAFFIC, I COASTED AT ABOUT 25MPH SINCE IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE, THEN IT EVENTUALLY DIED.  THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT, MY DEALER FILLED THE TANK WITH GAS (WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE PROBLEM TO OCCUR, KIND OF STUPID OF THEM), AND THEN DROVE IT AROUND, BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO SHOW THEM HOW TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  I MUST NOW KEEP MY GAS TANK MORE THAN HALF FULL, BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS IN GETTING ON AND OFF THE HIGHWAY.  IT EVEN DOES IT AROUND TOWN NOW, AT TIMES.  THE DEALER SAYS IT IS A RESULT OF A FUEL FILTER GETTING CLOGGED AND THEY WOULD JUST CLEAN IT OUT, BUT OTHER FOCUS OWNERS I ASSOCIATE WITH  (WWW.FOCALJET.COM) HAVE REPORTED THAT THIS IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX.  OTHERWISE, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS CAR, AND I APPLAUD FORD FOR THE RECALLS, THEY MAY MAKE OUR CAR LOOK BAD BUT IT SHOWS FORD IS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILTY FOR DEFECTS, AND TRYING TO IMPROVE ON THEM.  *AK",

LATER THAT EVENING WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MOVE THE FOCUS FROM MY DRIVEWAY INTO MY GARAGE, IT STARTED UP OK, BUT THEN STALLED AFTER ABOUT 5 SECONDS.  IT STALLED ABOUT 5 SECONDS AFTER EACH TIME IT STARTED.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER, DICK EDWARDS FORD, IN MANHATTAN, KANSAS, FOR 6/5/02.  I DID NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE ON 6/4/02.  ON 6/5/02, I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND BEGAN DRIVING TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CHECKED/FIXED.  ABOUT 2 MILES FROM MY HOUSE, THE FOCUS SUDDENLY STALLED AGAIN.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED THE REMAINING 3 MILES TO THE DEALER.  6/6/02 :  THE FOCUS IS CURRENTLY SITTING IN THE SERVICE BAY AT DICK EDWARDS FORD IN MANHATTAN, KANSAS.  TOMORROW (6/7/02) THE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL FILTER ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPLACED AT THE COST OF $500.00 (ESTIMATE).  TONIGHT (6/6/02) I SAW A REPORT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS ABOUT FORD FOCUSES BEING INVESTIGATED FOR STALLING PROBLEMS.  PERHAPS IT IS MERE COINCIDENCE, PERHAPS NOT.  THE REPORT ALLEGED THAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE A RESULT OF DEBRIS ACCUMULATING IN THE FUEL TANK.  ALSO NOTEWORTHY IS THE FACT THAT MY FOCUS HAD ITS 100,000 MILE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED ON 4/19/02, INCLUDING A NEW FUEL FILTER AND TUNE-UP.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT DICK EDWARDS FORD HAS DONE ALL THE MAINTENANCE ON THIS VEHICLE AT 5000 MILE INTERVALS.  I AM FILING THIS REPORT BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO SEE THE EVENING NEWS TONIGHT.

WHEN CONSUMER STEPS ON THE GAS PEDAL, THE ENGINE SEEMS TO STOP RUNNING.  WHEN CONSUMER LETS OFF THE PEDAL, THE ENGINE RUNS AGAIN AND ONCE THE CAR HAS ROLLED IN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR A SHORT DISTANCE, (50-100 FT.), CONSUMER IS ABLE TO ACCELERATE.  THIS PROBLEM BEGINS TO SHOW UP WHEN THE FUEL GAUGE INDICATES THE FUEL TANK IS LESS THAN FULL.  AT THAT POINT, THE STALLING PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS AFTER MAKING A HARD TURN.  THE STALLING PROBLEM IS EASIER TO REPLICATE AS THE AMOUNT OF FUEL INDICATED BY THE FUEL GAUGE DROPS BELOW 3/8 OF A TANK.  THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT OCCURRED WHEN MAKING ANY LEFT HAND TURNS. REAR ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS UP UNTIL ABOUT 38,000 MILES, THESE PROBLEMS WERE INTERMITTENT, AND WERENOT EVIDENT MOST OF THE TIME.

I DID NOT THINK THIS WAS A PRIORITY REPAIR SO WAITED UNTIL MY SPRING BREAK THE NEXT WEEK.  ON 3-27-02 I HAD THE REAR RIGHT DOOR OPENED, I CLOSED IT AND DROVE OFF.  WITHIN HALF A BLOCK THE DOOR SWUNG OPENED AT A STOP LIGHT AND A PASSING MOTORIST TOLD ME ABOUT IT BEFORE I DROVE OFF.  I CLOSED THE DOOR AND PROCEEDED DOWN THE HILL, WITHIN 3 BLOCKS THE DOOR SWUNG OPENED AGAIN.  I CHECKED THE HANDLE AND FOUND IT POPPED OUT INTO AN OPEN POSITION.  I FORCED IT BACK INTO PLACE, THERE WAS A SIMILAR CRACKING NOISE TO THAT MADE WHEN THE ORIGINAL DAMAGE WAS CAUSED.  I DROVE IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR 3-29-02.  I DID NOT CARRY ANYONE IN THE BACK SEAT UNTIL THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED.  THE SERVICE ORDER DESCRIBED THE REPAIR AS, \"REMOVED RIGHT REAR DOOR PANEL-REPLACED INNER HANDLE-BROKEN & OUT OF POSITION IN RATCHET ASSEMBLY-RETEST-OK.  THE DEALERSHIP TREATED THIS AS A WARRANTY REPAIR.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS NOT A FLUKE ACCIDENT, AS THE LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGE WHEN THE CAR IS PUT INTO GEAR, AND UNLOCKING THE REAR DOOR AT NIGHT WOULD BE A COMMON OCCURRENCE.

THE DRIVER'S SEAT HAS WOREN THRU FROM THE INSIDE OUT ALL THE WAY THRU THE SEAT COVER AND HAS CAUSED HOLES IN DRIVER'S PANTS. THIS SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO THE PASSENGER FRONT SEAT SINCE THE TWO ARE MADE THE SAME. THE DRIVER'S SEAT LEFT BOLTER SUPPORT BAR HAS ALSO BROKEN AWAY FROM THE SEAT PAN NEAR THE FRONT OF THE SEAT PAN WHERE IT WAS ATTACHED. I HAVE HAD THE SEAT COVER ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND FOAM REPLACED AND NOW ABOUT 8 MONTHS AFTER THE HOLES APPEARED AGAIN AND THE DEALER LOCAL TO ME - MILLENNIUM WILL NOT FIX IT UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY PERIOD OF THE CAR. THEY SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN FIXED TO MANY TIMES BEFORE. AT THEIR REQUEST I TOOK IT TO AN AUTO UPHOLSTERER AND THE COST TO FIX IT WOULD BE ABOUT $500. THE PROBLEM THO IS INHERENT IN THE SEAT DESIGN AND NOT FIXABLE FOR THE LONG TERM. IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN. THE SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY AND ESPECIALLY IN A FAST STOP OR ACCIDENT DRIVE THAT REAR END OF THE BOLSTER SUPPORT BAR INTO MY BUTTOCKS. ALSO THE FRONT END OF THE SAME BOLSTER BAR HAS BROKEN AWAY FROM THE WELD. FORD MAKES NO CLAIM TO THE FACT THAT WEIGHT IS AN ISSUE. I WIEGH 280 LBS AND AM 6'5\" TALL. DUE TO MY SIZE AND SIZE OF MY BUTTOCKS I AM ALWAYS SITTING ON THE BOLSTER BARS AND NOT BETWEEN THEM. WHILE FORD WILL NOT ADMIT TO A WEIGHT AND SIZE LIMIT OF THE SEATS - I FEEL THAT IS AN ISSUE. LEAR CORP. WHO MAKES THE SEAT FOR FORD SAYS THAT THE SEAT IS DESIGNED FOR THE 90-95 PERCENTILE AND IS NOT DESIGNED TO ACCOMONDATE LARGER FOLKS.

THE TRUCK SERVICE TECHNICIAN CHANGED OUR TIRE AND PUT ON THE SPARE.  THE CLOSEST GOODYEAR TIRE RETAILER OPEN ON 4TH OF JULY, WAS WALMART 150 MILES AWAY.

ALSO, KNOW THE TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED AT A FORD DEALER EVERY 5000 MILES (AS PER MY WARRANTY)  THE TIRE TECHNICIAN AT WALMART INFORMED US THAT THE TIRES WERE DAMAGED BY A DEFAULT IN THE CAR.  HE SAID THAT FORD \u0013TWEEKS THE ALIGNMENT ON THEIR CARS TO IMPROVE HANDLING\u0014 AND THAT SOMETIMES THAT \u0013TWEEKING\u0014 CAUSES UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR.  ALSO, HE INFORMED US THEY ARE 65,000 MILE TIRES AND SHOULD NOT BE WORN THROUGH IN 20,000 MILES.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT WEAR ON THE INSIDE OF THE OTHER BACK TIRE AND TOLD US WE WOULD NOT MAKE IT HOME DRIVING ON THAT TIRE.  FACED WITH FEW CHOICES, WE PURCHASED 2 NEW TIRES SO WE COULD DRIVE HOME TO ST. LOUIS.  THE TOTAL COST FOR THIS WAS $177.10. UPON RETURN TO ST. LOUIS I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR INTO MCMAHON FORD AND AFTER 3 DAYS, DOUG SUCHER INFORMED ME THAT THE \u0013CAMBER WAS AT 9\u0014 WHICH WAS DANGEROUSLY NEAR AN UNSAFE READING.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THERE WAS NO REPAIR AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE ALSO NEEDS NEW BRAKES DUE TO THIS DEFECT.  FURTHERMORE, HE SAID HE CONTACTED THE ENGINEERS AT FORD AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT HAVE NO SOLUTION AT THIS TIME.  HE DID CONFIRM THAT THE WEAR ON THE TIRES WAS CAUSED BY THE IMPROPER CAMBER SETTING AND WE WOULD CONTINUE TO GO THRU TIRES AND BRAKES AT AN UNUSUAL RATE.

THEN I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL WAS WOBBLING AT THE BASE -- I.E., THE POINT WHERE THE STEERING COLUMN ENTERED THE DASHBOARD.  I DROVE TO TED BRITT FORD (WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR) AND LEFT THE CAR FOR SERVICING.  ON TUESDAY, JULY 3, 2001, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT TED BRITT (JIM KIEFER OF THE BROWN TEAM) CALLED ME TO INFORM ME THAT THE STEERING COLUMN HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED IMPROPERLY BY THE MANUFACTURER.  I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO EXPLAIN THAT THE BOLTS TO THE STEERING COLUMN HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TIGHTENED, AND HAD SIMPLY COME LOOSE OVER TIME.  HE STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS SAME PROBLEM BEFORE.   I NOTE THAT THE CAR HAS BETWEEN 19,000 AND 20,000 MILES ON IT, AND IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR SINCE WE BOUGHT THE CAR FOR THIS PROBLEM TO MANIFEST ITSELF. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT 2000 FORD FOCUS STATION WAGONS HAVE NOT YET PUT 19,000 + MILES ON THEM, SO THIS PROBLEM (IF GENERAL TO ALL OR MANY FOCUSES) MAY STILL BE LATENT IN MANY CASES.

THE SMELL IS SO STRONG INSIDE THE CAR THAT PASSENGERS NOW REFUSE TO RIDE IN THE VEHICLE.  THE SMELL IS ALSO VERY STRONG FROM OUT SIDE THE CAR.  THE THIRD PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE IS WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR.  THE LOCK AND LATCH ARE VERY TIGHT AND ARE SOME TIMES IMBOSSIBLE TO TURN OR OPEN WITHOUT EXESSIVE FORCE.  THE DOOR HINGES ARE ALSO STIFF.  THIS IS A LOT OF FRICTION IN THE HINGES MAKING LOTS OF NOISE AND NOT ALLOWING THE DOOR TO MOVE SMOTHLEY.  THE LAST PROBLEM I AM REPORTING IS WITH THE SUSPENSION.

AS FAR AS THE WINDSHIELD IS CONCERNED IT ISN'T SEALED PROPERLY AND ALLOWS WATER TO ENTER THE CAR. FORD IS GOING TO TAKE THE WINDSHIELD OUT AND RESEAL IT. AGAIN THIS IS INCONVENIENT AND REALLY DISAPPOINTING FOR A NEW CAR TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE CAR ALSO HAS TWO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T SAFETY RELATED. THE RADIO BROKE AND FORD REPLACED IT AND THE PASSENGER SEAT HAD A BROKEN PART THAT IT TOOK OVER 4 MONTHS TO GET A PART FOR.  *AK",

THEY STATED THAT THE MASS AIR FLOW (MAF) SENSOR WAS NOT DEFECTIVE, BUT WAS MADE INOPERABLE BY OIL DEPOSITION RESULTING FROM THE OILED AIR FILTER THAT I HAD INSTALLED (AND THAT ALL SERVICE WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY WARRANTY).
