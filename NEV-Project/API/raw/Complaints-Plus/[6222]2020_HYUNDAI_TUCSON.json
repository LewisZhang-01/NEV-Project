I had a conversation with the previous owner and she told me that she had returned the unit to the dealer for the same situation. So far the dealer has not received an answer as to what is wrong with the unit. Nor have they provided me with a vehicle.

Driving on the Cruise Control I \u201cSet\u201d it to 70 mph. Driving on the two lane highway with both lanes blocked by other vehicles, I pressed the \u201cbrake\u201d pedal. The car slowed down and I continued driving at a lower speed. When traffic in front of me cleared, I pressed the \u201cResume\u201d button on Cruise Control. With no obstacles in front of me, my car was supposed to accelerate to the previously set speed of 70 mph. Instead, it was slowing down. When pressing the gas pedal the car was not accelerating. It felt like the car \u201clost power.\u201d It felt like the automatic transmission shifted to a Neutral or may be the lowest gear. Pushing the gas pedal did not do anything and on both occasions I managed to steer the car to a road shoulder. It was a scary situation with heavy fast moving traffic on a narrow mountain highway. I stopped the car, then tried to go again. It would go very slow on, what felt like, the lowest gear without acceleration. I then stopped the car again and turned off the engine. Turning the ignition off resets the electronics and I was able to get back on the road. The car continued to drive normally on Cruise Control until the same happened again the next day. As I said, it happened on two different occasions. From there on I avoided pushing the \u201cResume\u201d button on Cruise Control and I am afraid of using it from now on to avoid potential accidents. I consider this to be a life threatening malfunction and I reported it to Hyundai\u2019s Customer Care. They opened the Case Number and suggested going to the nearest dealer. I took the car to the nearest dealer. They kept it for several days, drove 40 miles and, as I expected, were not able to replicate the problem. In my opinion, this problem needs to be analyzed by the engineers not a dealership's technician. Is speed a factor? Is temperature a factor? What is the factor?",

Both the driver's safety and the safety of others are at risk, since it's not possible to see clearly what is behind the vehicle.  The problem has been confirmed by the dealer and the dealer requested a replacement backup camera, but Hyundai declined authorization for the replacement.  Federal regulation that went into effect in May 2018 requires that all new vehicles must have a backup camera.  Surely the backup camera must be usable, as opposed to just existing to satisfy the legal requirement?  This camera is so blurry it is barely usable.

The contact mentioned that when she attempts to exit because the vehicle was on the edge of an embankment when she exits the vehicle she fell into a tree then climbed up to the roadway where she was found unconscious. During the incident, the driver sustained a fractured left shoulder and head trauma. The contact currently was being seen by a Neurologist for her head trauma. A police report was taken at the scene and the vehicle was towed away. It took over an hour for the vehicle to be retrieved from the embankment. The cause of the failure was not determined. Prior to the crash, the vehicle had been serviced on multiple occasions for exhibiting a loss of power and hesitation to accelerate. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who replaced the transmission and reprogrammed the computer software but the failures continued to occur. The manufacturer was notified of the failures.
