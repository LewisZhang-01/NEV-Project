(ATTACHED BILL OF SALE) DUE TO SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE.    DUE TO EXTENSIVE RUST AND CORROSION DAMAGE, THE FRAME IS LIKELY TO COLLAPSE IN THE EVENT OF A REAR END COLLISION ENDANGERING THE SAFETY OF ITS PASSENGERS, RATHER THAN CRUSH AND ABSORB THE IMPACT AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO DO.     IN ADDITION, IT IS PRONE TO SWERVE AND POSSIBLY TIP OVER OUT OF CONTROL ON UNEVEN PAVEMENT DUE TO A MISSING PASSENGER SIDE REAR SHOCK THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED PRIOR TO PURCHASE (PHOTOS ATTACHED). THE LEFT SIDE SHOCK IS WORN OUT AND ALSO READY TO FALL OFF AT ANY MOMENT AS WELL.    BECAUSE THE FENDER WELLS ARE RUSTED THROUGH EXHAUST FUMES CAN ENTER THE PASSENGER CABIN WHICH COULD HAVE SERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES TO ITS INHABITANTS. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AT SOME POINT THE DAMAGED AREAS WERE COVERED WITH PAINT OR UNDERCOAT IN AN ATTEMPT TO HIDE THESE DEFECTS.    THE DRIVE SHAFT, THE FRAME AND THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE ARE SEVERELY CORROSION DAMAGED. THE PARKING BRAKE IS INOPERATIVE DUE TO RUST AND COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO ROLL DOWN HILL WHILE PARKED. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT RUST HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE FENDER FLARES.    HAD I KEPT DRIVING THIS VEHICLE I COULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED AND ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF OTHERS ON THE ROAD.

THESE PLUGS GENERATE TOO MUCH RF NOISE AND THEIR FAULTY COIL-ON-PLUG DESIGNED IGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH SUPPRESSION FOR THE EXCESSIVE RF NOISE.

UPON INSPECTION THE REAR PASSENGER WHEEL WELL HAD DISINTEGRATED AND WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE, AND THE RATTLE WAS THE STRUT THAT HAD COME UNDONE HITTING THE CARGO COMPARTMENT. JUST HAD TIRES AND BRAKES REPLACED AND THEY INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AS WELL ONLY 2 MONTHS PRIOR WITH NO MENTION OF ANY OTHER PROBLEMS.  NOW IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  NO HELP FROM MAZDA, INSURANCE, OR THE SUPER WARRANTY THAT COVERS EVERYTHING BUMPER TO BUMPER(OR SUPPOSE TO).  COME TO FIND OUT WHILE DOING SOME RESEARCH, THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MAZDA. THE 01-04 TRIBUTE HAS A RECALL FOR THE SAME THING EXCEPT CALLING FOR THE FRONT DRIVER WHEEL WELL. WHEN YOU TAKE IT IN THEY REPLACE ALL FOUR.  IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THE 05 MODEL YEAR HAS JUST AS MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS AS WELL. BOTH OF US WORK AND HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AS WELL AS GETTING THE CHILDREN TO MULTIPLE PLACES.  WE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE THINKING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD AND SAFE WAY TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO.  TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME WITH THIS ISSUE.

I HOPE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE.  2 ESTIMATES TO REPAIR BOTH ARE $5-7000.  CAN'T PAY TO FIX, AND CAN'T TRADE IT IN AS IT IS WORTHLESS RIGHT NOW.

ON FEBRUARY 10, 2015 I TOOK MY CAR TO NUCAR MAZDA IN NEW CASTLE WHO HAS SERVICED MY VEHICLE SINCE 2005.

THE SHOCK ATTACHED T THE VEHICLE HAD RUSTED AWAY, AS WELL. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE REAR COULD COLLAPSE.  I CONTACTED MAZDA HEADQUARTERS AND THEY SAID THAT DUE TO THE WAY THAT DELAWARE SALTS THEIR ROADS IS WHY THIS RUST OCCURRED ONLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  A FAMILY MEMBER SUGGESTED THAT I GET AN ESTIMATE FROM A BODY SHOP.  NORTHEAST BODY SHOP WAS ABLE TO REPAIR ALL OF THE PARTS THAT HAD RUSTED OUT AT A COST OF $2,710.00.

THEY HAVE BEEN RECALLED SO WHY WOULD NEWER UNITS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM NOT HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  FOR A NEWER CAR TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WOULD MAKE THIS ISSUE BE EVEN WORSE THEN THE MANUFACTURER IS REPORTING.  EVERY DEALER AND EVERY JUNK YARD TELLS ME THE SAME THING, THIS IS NOT ISOLATED TO THE 2001 - 2004 MODEL YEARS.    I HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO FIX THE MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND HOPE THAT THEY ADMIT MORE VEHICLES NEED TO BE RECALLED. THEY SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM AND PAY FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR TO REPAIR THEIR PROBLEM WHICH THEY KNOWINGLY PASSED ONTO THE CONSUMER.    I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO INFORM AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO NEVER BUY A MAZDA OR FORD VEHICLE UNTIL THEY PROVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CONSUMER, RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND PAY FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.

PIECES OF RUSTED STEEL PEEL AWAY WITH 2 FINGERS. THERE IS NO UPPER STRUT SUPPORT AND THE TOP THREADING OF THE STRUT IS HITTING THE PLASTIC INTERIOR PIECE IN THE TRUNK AREA. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN; IF THE LOWER STRUT MOUNT IS LOOSE, THEN THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE AREA AND POTENTIAL THE UPPER BRACKET GETS INTO THE TIRE. MY FAMILY'S SAFETY IS MY #1 PRIORITY.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS NOT A RECALL. BOTH THE 2005 MAZDA TRIBUTE AND THE 2005 FORD ESCAPE HAVE A HIGH VOLUME OF THIS DEFECT. BASING MY EXPERIENCE AS A QUALITY ENGINEER IN A SHEET STEEL FABRICATION FACILITY, THIS TYPE OF DEFECT CAN BE RELATED TO EITHER POOR MATERIAL QUALITY OR CHOICE OF MATERIALS, POOR ENGINEERING PRACTICES, POOR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND/OR POOR PROTECTION OF THE WHEEL WELL AREA (MORE DURABLE COATINGS).  EITHER WAY, BASED ON MY ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE AND OPINION, THIS DEFECT REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER. I HAVE HAD OLDER VEHICLES THAT NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF DEFECT. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A SIMILAR TYPE OF VEHICLE BY THIS MANUFACTURER AGAIN DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE NO RECALL CONDITION OF THIS PROBLEM. APPARENTLY THE MANUFACTURER IS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO QUALITY AND SAFETY RELATED ISSUES ON THE TRIBUTE AND ESCAPE. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN OLDER VEHICLE, BUT SOME QUALITY ISSUES DO NOT SHOW UP UNTIL YEARS LATER AND THE MANUFACTURER IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE TYPES OF SAFETY CONCERNS THE PUBLIC IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING WITH THESE VEHICLES.  *TR",

I REQUESTED TSB FIX INFORMATION SO I COULD CONSIDER WHAT WAS NEEDED TO FIX SO I COULD DECIDE MY MOST ECONOMICAL ROUTE TO GET IT FIXED BUT THEY REFUSED. THEY SAID THAT INFORMATION WOULD ONLY BE GIVEN TO MAZDA MECHANICS DUE TO \"LIABILITY\" CONCERNS.
