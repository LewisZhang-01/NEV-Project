I ENDED UP PURCHASING A BRAND NEW SET OF TIRES AND DUE TO THE ISSUE ON THESE TIRES WITH LESS THAT 3000 MILES ON THEM, I PURCHASED A DIFFERENT BRAND ALTOGETHER.  I WENT TO THE DEALER IN APRIL FOR AN ISSUE AND FOUND THAT NISSAN HAS STARTED TO REPLACE THESE TIRES BASED UPON A RECALL.  I AM NOW OUT THE MONEY THAT I PAID AFTER I HAD COMPLAINED THAT THIS TIRE HAD ALREADY HAD A SAFETY ISSUE YET NOW THE MANUFACTURER OF THE TIRE IS REPLACING THEM.
