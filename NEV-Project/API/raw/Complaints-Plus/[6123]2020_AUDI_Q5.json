No warning, no way to Live the car to safety, all the warning lights began to flash, windows started to rolling up and down. Then the car just turned off. Unable to start it, turn it on, move it, nothing.   Needed a special tow truck to have it towed to dealer.   A serious safety issue. I am 8 m pregnant, had my brother and 4 year old nephew in car.   I am concerned for my safety but equally concerned for every Q5 has this gateway module in this location.  Every person driving a Q5 and other drivers can be affected by the design flaw of the location/ lack of protection of this  gateway module.    We were lucky we were not on the highway.

        "summary": "On July 14, 2020, my daughter and I drove my leased Audi Q5 to Cari\u2019s sister\u2019s home. As I pulled in the driveway, and before I turned off the vehicle and exited the car, smoke began to billow from the engine compartment and enter the interior. My daughter and I were suddenly engulfed by white smoke, and evacuated the vehicle immediately. With the use of a garden hose and fire extinguishers, my sister, brother-in-law, and I were able to subdue the fire until the fire department arrived and extinguished it fully. My Audi Q5 was totaled due to this fire that, suddenly and without warning, engulfed the engine compartment. After the incident, Audi inspected the vehicle.  Ultimately, Audi stated that the cause/origin of the engine compartment fire was due to the turbocharger electronic waste gate malfunction.             My daughter and I were stunned, shocked, and scared by the car\u2019s sudden and unexpected combustion. Naturally, the trauma and terror of having a car ignite for seemingly no reason are significant, and weigh on my daughter and me. First, the terror of having to fend off a car fire from surrounding people and property is arduous and horrible. Second, my daughter, to this day, still thinks that a car in which she is a passenger may erupt in flames at any given moment. She does not realize that this may have been a one-off accident, and fears simply riding in a vehicle as a result. No person should have to go through the harrowing experience of pulling their daughter out of a burning car and extinguishing the fire before it can damage even more property or take a life. Importantly, the smoke that engulfed the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment exacerbated my asthma. For months after the incident, my breathing was strained and I suffered more severe asthma symptoms. Audi/VW made a minimal offer and I have had to engage attorneys to seek compensation for the damages my daughter and I suffered as a result of this incident.",

AUDI'S 'AUTO STOP/START' FEATURE SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, THEN IMMEDIATELY ALL ELECTRONICS SHUT DOWN. THE CAR BASICALLY 'TURNED ITSELF OFF.'     VEHICLE THEN BEGAN DRIFTING/COASTING INTO INTERSECTION.
