THIS CREATES SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD WITH IMPAIRED STEERING ABILITY ALONG WITH ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE VEHICLE FROM TRAFFIC BEFORE IT OVERHEATS, STALLS, OR ENGINE CATCHES FIRE.

WHEN A LIQUID (RAIN/SNOW/LUBRICANT, ETC.) IS INTRODUCED TO THE PULLEY SYSTEM, THESE SMOOTH SURFACES ALLOW THE BELT TO EASILY SLIP OFF.

        "summary": "MY CAR WAS JUST IN A MINOR FRONT END ACCIDENT DURING A SNOWSTORM. WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINOR FRONT END REPAIRS NOW IS RESULTING IN A BIG ISSUE FOR MY FAMILY. MY VAN WAS IN GOOD CONDITION. I AM THE 2ND OWNER. THE MECHANIC, WHILE INSPECTING THE VEHICLE, FOUND A BROKEN DRIVERS SIDE SHOCK TOWER. THIS IS DAMAGE IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE SINCE IT IS CAUSED BY RUST AND IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES. HAD IT NOT BEEN COMMON, ALLSTATE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THIS LOOPHOLE AND THE COST TO REPAIR THE SHOCK TOWER WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. I AM FINDING, THROUGH RESEARCH, THAT THIS FLAW IN CHRYSLER VEHICLES IS VERY COMMON, YET HAS NEVER BEEN RECALLED BY CHRYSLER. ON THE WEB I SEE BLOG AFTER BLOG ABOUT THIS DEFECT YET CHRYSLER DOES NOT DEEM IT NECESSARY TO RECALL. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS REPAIR IS ROUGHLY $3000 EACH SIDE! THAT IS 3/4 WORTH THE VALUE OF MY CAR.  I THOUGHT THIS VAN WOULD BE WITH MY FAMILY FOR A DECADE, BUT I ONLY HAD THE VAN FOR 3 YEARS! DUE TO THIS FLAW IN THE VEHICLE, IT WILL BE SOLD FOR PARTS. I CANNOT AFFORD THE REPAIR COSTS. SINCE I AM A SINGLE MOM OF FOUR, JUST LAID OFF TWO WEEKS AGO, THIS \"FLAW\" OF CHRYSLER'S DODGE GC WILL COST ME MORE THAN JUST ITS REPLACEMENT VALUE. THIS IS WRONG. KNOW OF ANY CLASS ACTION SUITS AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR THE SHOCK TOWER FLAW? THEY HAVE ISSUED A TSB # 23-044-02 ON OCTOBER 14, 2002. SO THEY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS AND YET IT CONTINUES. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.   SINCERELY, LAURA HOSKE  *TR",

(THIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AS I WOULD EXPECT THAT BRAKE LINE FAILURES WOULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF SERVICE.)  I HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE LINES RUNNING TO THE MASTER CYLINDER SHOW SIMILAR DETERIORATION WHICH WILL SOON REQUIRE THEIR REPLACEMENT AS WELL.  THE LINES ARE CORRODING IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE STAINLESS STEEL BRAIDED HOSE SECTIONS WHICH APPEAR TO BE OF METAL DIFFERING FROM WHAT THE BRAKE LINE ITSELF IS MADE FROM.  GIVEN THAT THE FAILURE IS OCCURRING IN AN AREA WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE DISSIMILAR METALS (AN OBVIOUS FAILURE POINT IN AREAS USING SALT ON THE ROADS DURING WINTER - SEE ARTICLES COVERING \"GALVANIC CORROSION\") THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE MADE EFFORT TO KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING AND SHOULD OFFER SOME SORT OF REPAIR / RECALL ARRANGEMENT.

WASHINGTON ST., INDIANAPOLIS, IN 46222 (317-636-8061) MODIFIY MY 1999 DODGE MINI VAN  WITH ZERO EFFORT STEERING & A PAC UNIT (POWER ASSIST HAND CONTROL). ALONG WITH THIS THERE WERE REMOTE SWITCHES INSTALLED FOR THE LIGHTS.WASHER, WIPER, & HORN. SINCE DRIVING IT AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS 10-16-02 THE BRAKES HAVE CONSTANTLY GRABBED AND THE STEERING WILL CATCH AS YOU APPLY THE BRAKES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN COMING TO A STOP LIGHT AND TRYING TO SLOW DOWN TURNING THE CORNER, OR IN A PARKING LOT WHEN TRYING TO PARK. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN GOING DOWN HILL AND A CHILD WOULD RUN OUT IN FRONT OF ME THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WOULD LOCK UP, (YOU COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE SWERVING TO MISS THE CHILD WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES). THEY SAY THIS IS A NORMAL PHENOMENON. I SAY IT IS A DANGEROUS THING & SHOULD NOT BE ALOUD, AND AM ASKING FOR YOUR HELP IN STOPPING THIS PRODUCT FROM BEING PUT ON THE MARKET. I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT BUT, ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD. I HAVE HAD THE VAN SETTING RUNNING AT AN IDLE SPEED WITHOUT BEING IN GEAR LOCK UP THE STEERING AND THE BRAKES. I HAD A BIG MAN WITH ME (OVER SIX FEET TALL) HE GOT OUT AND LOOKED & THE WHEELS WERE STRAIGHT (NOT TURNED ALL THE WAY EITHER WAY). HE WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL EITHER.*JB",

WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE POWER STEERING, ALTERNATOR, WATER PUMP, AND ALL OTHER COMPONENTS POWERED BY THE BELT STOP FUNCTIONING.  THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN AT HIGH SPEEDS.  SERVICE BULLETIN 07-02-99, \"SERPENTINE BELT SLIPS OFF IDLER PULLEY\"  INSTALLS A BRACKET TO PREVENT THIS.  MY CONCERN IS THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THIS SERVICE BULLETIN UNTIL THE BELT COMES OFF.  THERE IS UNDUE RISK TO OWNERS OF THESE VANS.  THIS NEEDS TO BE A VEHICLE RECALL NOT A SERVICE BULLETIN.  I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER VIA THE INTERNET (REFERENCE NUMBER:  7904321) AND WRITTEN TO JAMES HOLDEN'S OFFICE, CHRYSLER PRESIDENT .  I WAS INFORMED TO CONTACT NHTSA AS THE INFORMATION WAS PROPRIETARY.  I HAVE FRIENDS WITH THE SAME VAN THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM IN RAIN STORMS. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE.  DO PEOPLE HAVE TO BE KILLED BEFORE CHRYSLER TAKES A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO SOLVING THIS ON ALL VEHICLES EFFECTED?  A VEHICLE RECALL IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT INJURIES. I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED IN CHRYSLER FOR ALLOWING ME AND MY FAMILY TO BE EXPOSED TO THIS DESIGN FLAW FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

AGAIN, I REPORTED TO DEALER SERVICE THE SAME PROBLEM ON 9/9/99; DEALER SERVICE SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM FOUND. AGAIN, I REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM TO DEALER SERVICE ON 1/18/2000; AGAIN, THEY SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM FOUND.  THE DAY I TOOK THE VAN TO DEALER TO POSSIBLY TRADE FOR A NEW CAR, THE SALESMAN DROVE THE VAN AND IMMEDIATELY SAID IT HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE TRANSMISSION WOULDN'T EVEN SHIFT GEARS.  THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED; HOWEVER, CHRYSLER SAID THEY WOULD COVER THE REPAIR SINCE I HAD HAD THE VAN IN SO MANY TIMES BEFORE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS WAS 5/20/00.  THEY KEPT THE VAN ALL WEEK, AND FINALLY SAID IT WAS REPAIRED.  I PICKED UP THE VAN ON 5/27/00, AND BEFORE I GOT 5 (FIVE) MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP, AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY AT 65 MPH, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AGAIN, AND IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES. THE SPEEDODEMETER WENT TO ZERO AND IT KICKED BACK DOWN INTO FIRST GEAR AND WOULDN'T SHIFT BACK.  WHEN THIS HAPPENED ALL FOUR OF MY CHILDREN AND MY HUSBAND WERE IN THE VAN, AND ONE OF MY CHILDREN'S HEAD WAS SLUNG FORWARD AND THEN BACK. SHE HAS BEEN COMPLAINING WITH A HEADACHE EVER SINCE.  I TOOK THE VAN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, (IN 1ST GEAR), AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD TRY AGAIN.  MY CHILD IS HURT, AND MY  VEHICLE IS A LEMON!  WHAT CAN I DO?*AK",

THE MOVEMENT OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM ALSO PUNCTURED A HOLE IN THE REAR OF THE MUFFLER THAT WOULD HAVE ALSO PRESENTED A CARBON MONOXIDE SITUATION. IF I HAD NOT HAD MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER LOOK AT MY VAN ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY, MY FAMILY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.
