RECENTLY WE WERE DRIVING DOWN AN INTERSTATE (WITH OUR TWO CHILDREN) AND THE \"CHECK POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE CAME ON THE DIGITAL DISPLAY, AND RIGHT AFTER THAT THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN/LOCKED UP. WE PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AT THE NEXT EXIT AND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT, AS IT SUGGESTED - AND IT FIXED IT TEMPORARILY. BUT IT DID THE SAME THING TWO MORE TIMES ON SECONDARY ROADS AS WE LIMPED THE CAR HOME. LUCKILY WE WERENT FAR AWAY.  HER MECHANIC REPLACED THE ENTIRE EPS (ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING) SYSTEM, WHICH WAS PRETTY EXPENSIVE - BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE SINCE WE WERE MOVING AT ABOUT 65MPH WHEN IT OCCURRED. IM LOOKING INTO IF THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL SINCE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS ON HERE STATING THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THEM.",

ALMOST THE SAME FEEL WHEN THE CAR IGNITION IS OFF.     - THERE WAS NO SNOW OR ICE ON THE ROAD, SO THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SKIDDING, JUST PLAIN BRAKE FAILURE.    - DRIVING WAS ON PAVED CITY STREETS    THIS CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED BY AN ACURA / HONDA DEALER ALWAYS PER MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.  *TR",
