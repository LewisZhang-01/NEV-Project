THANK GOD NO ONE WAS HURT.   WEAR AND TEAR IS DRASTICALLY INCREASED AS THE VEHICLE IS TRYING TO DRIVE ON ITS OWN AS I'M TRYING TO STOP AT TRAFFIC LIGHT, STOP SIGNS, OR SIMPLY PARKING. DRIVE-TRAIN IS BANGING, BRAKES ARE WORKING HARDER, AND FUEL IS BEING WASTED. NOW, ADD A PAYLOAD OR TRAILER AS I OFTEN DO AND PROBLEMS ARE MAGNIFIED. ESSENTIALLY THE VEHICLE IS AGING AND WEARING ITS SELF OUT BEFORE ITS TIME.  I HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY PIMA COUNTY COURT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE FIXED OR REPLACE. THE OFFICER THAT GAVE ME THE CITATION WITNESSED THE HIGH ENGINE IDLE AND AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO STOP ESPECIALLY WITH A LOADED TRAILER AS I HAD THAT DAY. OFFICER  ALSO TESTIFIED THIS IN COURT ON 11/4/2015.        THERE IS A CURRENT LAW SUIT IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIS DEFECT.

(THE BULB PRESUMABLY MEETS FEDERAL STANDARDS, BUT THE PROJECTOR SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR A BRIGHTER BULB).  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE SIDES OF THE ROAD, OR VERY FAR DOWN THE ROAD, ON ROADS WHERE THERE ARE NO STREETLIGHTS.  IT IS EVEN WORSE ON A RAINY, DARK ROAD.  GM INSTITUTED A TSB (#PIT5374, ATTACHED) IN FEBRUARY 2015 WHICH INVOLVES REPROGRAMMING THE BODY CONTROL MODULE (BCM) TO INCREASE THE VOLTAGE TO THE HEADLIGHT BULBS AND SUBSTITUTING VOSLA HIR 55 WATT BULBS FOR THE ORIGINAL STOCK 55 WATT BULBS.  THE RESULTS ARE A MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE NEW 2016 MODELS HAVE THE SAME HEADLIGHT DESIGN BUT HAVE BEEN UPGRADED TO A HID BULB THAT CANNOT JUST BE PLUGGED INTO THE 2014/15 HEADLIGHTS.  THE IMPROVED BULB AND WIRING IS EVIDENCE THE TSB DID NOT REALLY IMPROVE THE LIGHTING VERY MUCH.  (THE INTERNET IS FULL OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE; RECOMMEND YOU GOOGLE \"GMC SIERRA HEADLIGHTS\" AND SEE WHAT YOU GET!).   I LIVE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND WOULD BE GLAD TO COME DOWN TO THE NHTSA BUILDING ON A DARK, RAINY NIGHT AND GIVE YOU A RIDE -- THE PROBLEM ISN'T SO BAD IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STREETLIGHTS, BUT IT IS TERRIBLE OUT IN THE COUNTRY.  BOTTOM LINE, GM SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO ISSUE A RECALL THAT INVOLVES REPLACING THE WIRING HARNESS AND BULB WITH THEIR LATEST DESIGN.  THE HEADLIGHTS IN THE 2014/2014 SIERRA ARE HAZARDOUS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE TRUCK AND TO PEDESTRIANS ALONG THE ROAD.   THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY COMPLAINT, AND PLEASE TAKE ACTION FOR SAFETY'S SAKE.  (NOTE: THERE IS NO SPECIFIC TIME, MILEAGE, MPH, ETC., THAT THIS WAS NOTED.  IT IS CONTINUAL.  I HAD THE TSB PERFORMED IN THE SUMMER OF 2015 AND NOTED MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT AT THAT TIME.)",

IF VEHICLE IS NOR DRIVEN FASTER OR SLOWER TO GET OUT OF VIBRATION RANGE, THE TRUCK WILL VIBRATE ENDLESSLY. 2014 GMC SIERRA IS AN UNSAFE VEHICLE. NEEDING TO SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN TO PREVENT VIBRATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES RISK FOR MVA. NEEDING TO DRIVE IN 5TH GEAR RATHER THAN 6TH GEAR REDUCES GAS MILEAGE AS REPORTED TO NHSTA. LOCAL MECHANICS HAVE COMMENTED THAT THE ABOVE VIBRATION COMPLAINT IS COMMON TO 2014  6 CYLINDER  GMC/CHEVY FULL SIZE PICKUP TRUCKS AND THAT THE VIBRATION MAY BE SECONDARY TO CYLINDER DEACTIVATION AND CHASSIS RIGIDITY.  IT CERTAINLY WOUND BE A SHAME FOR A COLLISION TO OCCUR OR FOR A PEDESTRIAN TO GET RUN OVER BY A DRIVER OF A 2014 GMC/CHEVY FULL SIZE PICKUP WHO HAD TO SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE VIBRATION AT APX 1500 RPM",
