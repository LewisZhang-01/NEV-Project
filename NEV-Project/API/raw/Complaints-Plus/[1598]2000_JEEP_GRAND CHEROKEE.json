I BOUGHT A NEW MATCHING RIM AND PUT TIRE BACK ON JEEP.  THREE MONTHS LATER, SAME PROBLEM ON DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL, AIR LEAKING THROUGH RUSTED RIM. I REPLACED THAT RIM AND NOTICED RUST ON BOTH FRONT RIMS. KNOWING IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME I REPLACED THEM AS WELL. I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS IN MY LIFE, I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS, AND I NEVER HAD A RIM RUST THROUGH CAUSING AIR TO ESCAPE. I LOOKED AT THE RIMS AND DISCOVERED THE CAUSE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RIMS ARE DESIGNED, WHENEVER IT RAINS, OR THERE IS SLUSH ON THE ROAD OR WHEN THE JEEP IS WASHED THERE IS ALWAYS A SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER THAT GETS TRAPPED AND SETTLES ON THE BOTTOM OF RIM WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED. THERE IS NOWHERE FOR THE WATER TO DRAIN. NOW IF THAT WATER ALSO CONTAINS DISSOLVED ROAD SALT AND THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY FOR DAYS IT IS ONLY ACCELERATING THE DETERIORATION. EVEN AFTER DRIVING FOR A FEW MILES THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE HOLDS THE WATER IN PLACE AND AGAIN RETURNS TO REST ON THE BOTTOM OF RIM ONCE PARKED. I REALIZE IT IS AN OLDER VEHICLE WITH HIGH MILEAGE, BUT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW NO WHEELS SHOULD RUST OUT LIKE THIS, AND PERHAPS OWNERS OF SIMILAR JEEPS WILL CHECK OUT THEIR WHEELS AND REPLACE RIMS BEFORE THEY WIND UP STUCK SOMEPLACE WITH A FLAT TIRE.",

THIS IS A MANUAL ADJUST SEAT.  I AM ORIGINAL OWNER AND OF AVERAGE BUILD.  VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLISION, ABUSED IN ANY WAY, AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  I CONDUCTED MY OWN INFORMAL INVESTIGATION.  THE SEAT BASE FRAME WHERE IT ATTACHES TO THE SEAT TRACK IS A LIGHT WEIGHT SHEET METAL STAMPING.  THE HOLES IN THE STAMPING THAT ACCEPT THE SEAT TRACK ATTACHMENT STUDS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSIZE COMPARED WITH THE SIZE OF THE STUD.  THE SEAT TRACK STUD IS FASTENED TO THE SEAT BASE WITH A BARE NUT THAT IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE HOLE DIAMETER.  THIS RESULTS IN THE NUT BEARING DOWN ON A VERY SMALL SURFACE AREA OF THE SHEET METAL.  HIGH STRESS IS CREATED AT THESE POINTS, ESPECIALLY IF THE NUT IS NOT EXACTLY CENTERED ON THE OVERSIZE HOLE.  ALSO, THE FRONT ATTACH POINTS ARE SEVERAL INCHES TO THE REAR OF THE FRONT EDGE OF THE SEAT FRAME, FURTHER INCREASING FORCES ON THESE POINTS FOR ANY REARWARD FORCE ON THE UPPER SEAT BACK.  OVER TIME DURING NORMAL USE, THIS RESULTED IN STRESS CRACKING AND SUBSEQUENT FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE SHEET METAL.  DURING A HIGH IMPACT EVENT SUCH AS A REAR-END COLLISION, THIS COULD CAUSE SUDDEN FAILURE OF THE SEAT ATTACH POINTS, RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, INJURY TO THE FRONT SEAT OCCUPANT, AND INJURY TO ANYONE SEATED IN THE REAR SEAT BEHIND THE FRONT SEAT OCCUPANT.  A SIMPLE FLAT WASHER OR OTHER REINFORCEMENT OF THE HOLES IN THE SEAT BASE SHEET METAL COULD PREVENT THIS MODE OF FAILURE.  I RECOMMEND THAT ANY VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH SEATS OF THIS DESIGN HAVE THE SEATS INSPECTED FOR CRACKS IN THE SHEET METAL BASE, REPAIRED OR REPLACED IF NECESSARY, AND HAVE THE SEAT ATTACHMENT POINTS REINFORCED WITH HEAVY WASHERS.  *TR",

THEY SAID IF IT WERE THE SENSING UNIT IN THE GAS TANK, IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER A RECALL. THEY SAID IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP ITSELF, NOT THE SENSOR, AND THEREFORE, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY AROUND $1000.00 TO HAVE THE FUEL PUMP REPLACED. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PUMP, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PICKUP DEVICE WHENTHE TANK LEVEL DROPS BELOW 1/4, AND THIS HAPPENS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. I HAVE CHECKED SEVERAL WEB SITES AND FOUND QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME SITUATION. I CALLED CHRYSLER TODAY AT 1-800-992-1997 AND WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 1-800-853-1403.

IT IS JUST INEXCUSABLE AND I CANT BELIEVE THERE WAS NEVER A RECALL FOR THIS .  I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED FROM THIS DEFECT . I'M SURE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY AND MANY OTHERS SEVERELY INJURED BECAUSE OF THIS HORRIBLE FAILURE .   I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER VEHICLE THAT THIS HAPPENS TO .  I'VE OWNED MANY CARS AND HAVE MANY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WHO HAVE OWNED CARS AND NOT ONE  HAS EVER HAD A SEAT WHERE THE WELDS COMPLETELY SNAPPED OFF - JUST BROKE AT ALL THE WELDS - LIKE THE 2000 GRAND CHEROKEE .  YOU WANT PROOF ?  GO ONLINE AND GOOGLE SEARCH THIS TOPIC AND YOU WILL SEE HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS .  I WAS NOT ABLE TO RE-WELD THIS SEAT BECAUSE THE DAMAGE WAS SO SEVERE .  I HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE SEAT NEW .... BECAUSE NO JUNK YARDS OR ONLINE SERVICES ( E-BAY ) HAVE ANY USED ONES AVAILABLE  BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS SO WIDESPREAD .  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS- VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT AND I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE .  I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE .  I'M SURE IF YOU STRESS - TESTED THIS VEHICLE YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND THE DEFECT IN THE FIRST PLACE .   I'M ONLY 185 POUNDS SO MY WEIGHT COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED COMPLETE BREAKAGE .  I JUST GOT IN THE VEHICLE ONE DAY AND THE WHOLE SEAT JUST SNAPPED RIGHT OFF THE FRAME !  HOW WAS THIS NOT DISCOVERED BY JEEP DURING TESTING ?

MOST CARS HAVE LIGHT SOCKETS WITH THEIR WIRING ATTACHED. THE SOCKET TWISTS INTO THE LAMP ASSEMBLY. ON THE GRAND CHEROKEE, THE SOCKET DOES NOT HAVE THE WIRING ATTACHED. INSTEAD, THE WIRING GOES INTO THE LAMP ASSEMBLY AND THE SOCKET HAS THREE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS THAT, WHEN TWISTED INTO THE ASSEMBLY, WILL MAKE THE CONTACT. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST FREQUENT MALFUNCTION IS THAT THE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS (WHICH MAKE CONTACT WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE ELECTRICAL PATHS WHEN THEY ARE INSERTED INTO THE ASSEMBLY) ARE PRESSED TIGHT TO ENSURE GOOD CONTACT WITH THE ASSEMBLY...AND ON MANY TAILLIGHTS, THE PLASTIC RING CONTAINING THE RESPECTIVE PATHS OFTEN BEGINS TO SEPARATE FROM THE FATIGUE OF THE CONTACTS PRESSING SO HARD. OF THE THREE CONTACTS (REAR TAIL LIGHT, REAR BRAKE LIGHT AND GROUND), THE GROUND IS WHAT MOST COMMONLY LOSES ITS CONTACT DUE TO FATIGUE CRACKING.

THE PART IS REMOVED WHICH MEANS TO CUT WIRES TO DETACH THE PART. THIS MEANS THE NEW PART WILL HAVE TO BE REWIRED BACK IN. JEEP SHOULD HAVE TO REPLACE ALL OF THE UNIT WIRES, AND PLASTIC CONNECTORS, AND FIND A WAY TO CONTROL THE MELT DOWN! PART UNFIXED DUE TO LACK OF MONEY TO REPAIR....! NO A/C IS BETTER THAN A BURNT CAR. (RIGHT????) OLD PART IS AVAILABLE AND A VERY COMMON PART TO BUY; RECALL IT JEEP! SOMEONE ELSE BEING SPOILED WOULD HAVE KEPT TURNING ON THE A/C FOR A BABY AND CAUGHT FIRE TO THE CAR. LUCKY FOR JEEP COMPANY, AND MYSELF I STOPPED USING THE A/C UNTIL LOOKED AT. RECALL IT...DEATH OR TOTAL LOSS OF CAR? ALOT OF A/C PROBLEMS IN THESE CARS HELP!  *TR",

AFTER IT HAPPENED A SECOND TIME 2 WEEKS LATER I SEARCHED THE INTERNET FINDING A REPAIR MESSAGE BOARD WWW.CARSURVEY.ORG/VIEWMORECOMMENTS_REVIEW_33943_11.HTML THAT ASSISTED ME IN IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM AND FIXING IT PERMANENTLY.

ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE TAIL ASSEMBLY AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE AND ON A BENCH, REMOVE THE LIGHT SOCKET FOR THE TAIL/BRAKE LIGHT. YOU WILL SEE 3 SILVER CONTACT POINTS INSIDE THE BLACK PLASTIC RING. 2 ARE GROUPED TOGETHER AND THERE IS ONE THAT IS OPPOSITE OF THE 2. THE ONE BY ITSELF IS THE GROUND; THE OTHER TWO ARE THE CONTACTS FOR THE TAIL LIGHT AND BRAKE LIGHT. THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE GROUND CONNECTOR. 4 CLEAN ALL CONTACTS WITH A Q-TIP AND SOME SORT OF CONTACT CLEANER. 5. YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT THE GROUND CONTACT IS DEPRESSED INTO THE PLASTIC AND THE PLASTIC ITSELF IS SLIGHTLY WARPED DOWN. I WAS ABLE TO USE A SMALL PAIR OF NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS THAT HAVE A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO PRESS UP ON THE CONTACT FROM UNDERNEATH USING THE OPPOSITE LIP OF THE HOLE AS LEVERAGE (VERY CAREFULLY).ONCE IT HAD MOVED UP A BIT, I WAS ABLE TO WEDGE A MINI-FLATHEAD SCREWDRIVER IN BETWEEN THE METAL CONTACT AND THE PLASTIC TO FORCE THE CONTACT UP EVEN FURTHER.

AFTER CHECKING THE USUAL DEFECTS (FUSES, BULBS, RELAYS) AND NOT FINDING ANY PROBLEMS I WENT ONLINE AND WAS SHOCKED TO FIND MULTIPLE POSTINGS RELATED TO BRAKE LIGHT FAILURES ON JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES (MINE IS A 2000) I WAS ALSO SHOCKED THAT DESPITE REPEATED POSTINGS ON THIS PROBLEM ,DATING BACK SEVERAL YEARS, THAT THERE IS NO SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM. THERE IS AN OBVIOUS FLAW IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THESE VEHICLES THAT CAUSE BRAKE LIGHTS TO FAIL, LIGHTS THAT ALERT DRIVERS BEHIND YOU THAT YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SLOWING/STOPPING. THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE? ARE THEY WAITING FOR A TRAGEDY TO OCCUR BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING? THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE RESORTING TO HOMEMADE REMEDIES RATHER THAN PAY THE EXCESSIVE COST OF REPLACING A DEFICIENT ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE TROUBLING. I WON'T EVEN GET INTO MY LEFT TURN SIGNAL RANDOMLY WORKING, ALSO MENTIONED ON THE MESSAGE BOARDS. JEEP CAN CONSIDER ITSELF LUCKY THAT I WAS NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM BY ANOTHER MOTORIST, RATHER THAN AS A RESULT OF MY VEHICLE BEING REAR-ENDED BY A DRIVER UNAWARE THAT I WAS SLOWING. MY 1 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU COULD OFFER IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU.  *TR",

PLEASE CALL ME OR EMAIL ME WITH ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.  ONCE AGAIN, I WILL ALSO SEND PICTURES UPON REQUEST.  THANKS!  *TR",

I COMPLAINED OF IT SHIMMYING AND GRINDING SOUND IN THE BACK, BUT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND A THING WRONG.  IN FEBRUARY HAVING ABOUT $18,000 MILES ON IT THAT I NEEDED A NEW FUEL PUMP - $900.00 WORTH.  SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN DOWN HILL.  I HAVE COMPLAINED SINCE DAY ONE THAT MY VEHICLE SHIMMIES OUT OF CONTROL INTERMITTENTLY, AND NO ONE COULD FIND ANYTHING WRONG, JUST PUT NEW CONTROL ARMS AND BUSHINGS ON IT AND, STEERING PINION, TIGHT STEERING, AND A HOST OF OTHER SUCH REMEDIES, TO NO AVAIL.  THIS PAST WEEKEND, I WAS ALMOST IN A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT ON HIGHWAY 94, AS I DID GO OUT OF TOWN, AFTER THE ABOVE WAS FIXED, BUT APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T HELP AS MY VEHICLE SHOOK ALMOST OUT OF CONTROL AGAIN. I PUT ON MY BREAKS IMMEDIATELY AND HAD TO GO TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I STOPPED, SAT FOR A WHILE, AND THEN DROVE OFF, AND IT WAS OKAY FOR A WHILE, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, A DRIVER FROM BEHIND ALMOST HIT ME WHEN I HAD TO PUT MY BREAKS ON TO TRY TO CONTROL IT SOME.   I AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS VEHICLE AND FEEL IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED BACK WHEN I FIRST COMPLAINED YEARS AGO.  I WROTE DAIMLER CHRYSLER A LETTER REGARDING THE FUEL PUMP A FEW YEARS AGO, BUT THE COMPANY DIDN'T EVEN RESPOND.  IN THE MEANTIME, I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,  I WANT TO TRADE IT IN, BUT FEEL I WAS SOLD A REAL LEMON AND SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THE HASSLES, REPAIR COSTS, ETC.

SHE TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AFTER THE MOST RECENT FAILURE AND THEY STATED THAT SHE WOULD NEED ANOTHER FUEL PUMP.  SHE CALLED DAIMLER CHRYSLER WHO STATED THAT SHE NEEDED TO TAKE HER VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER.  CHRYSLER STATED THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE PARTS OF HER VEHICLE AT NO COST.  WHEN SHE TOOK HER VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER, THEY STATED THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CHRYSLER GAVE HER THE WRONG INFORMATION AND THAT HER VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT HER VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN SINCE DUE TO THE PREVIOUS CRASH AND FAILURES.  THE DEALER AND THE CONTACT HAVE ALL OF THE REPAIR DOCUMENTATION.

HE SAID IN THEIR SYSTEM IT STATES THAT THEY REPLACED THE AFTER  MARKET FAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOT BLOWING ENOUGH AIR. WELL THAT IS WRONG, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HANS WAS NOT WILLING TO BE HELPFUL AND TAKE CARE OF THE MATTER.

I HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED BY A DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THE STEERING GEAR BOX IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. SINCE I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, WE HAVE DISCONTINUED DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR NOW. AFTER SOME RESEARCH FOR THE POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM I FOUND THE FOLLOWING RECALL NOTICE:  2000 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO NHTSA RECALL ID NUMBER: 99V312000   RECALL DATE: NOV 04, 1999  COMPONENT: STEERING:GEAR BOX (OTHER THAN RACK AND PINION) POTENTIAL UNITS AFFECTED: 1259 PLEASE REVIEW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, MY OWN VEHICLE WAS ALSO BUILT IN AUGUST OF 1999 (PER STICKER ON VEHICLE). AFTER TALKING TO THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF MY VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, I WAS ONLY TOLD THAT THERE ARE NO OPEN ISSUES LISTED ON MY VEHICLE AND THEY COULD NOT EVEN TELL ME IF MY STEERING GEAR WAS REPLACED AT THE TIME OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER. AFTER CALLING CHRYSLER CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE, I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE IS NO OPEN RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME.  HERE IS MY REQUEST TO YOU:  PLEASE CONTACT DAIMLER CHRYSLER TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION AS TO WHY MY VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BUILT IN EXACTLY THE SAME TIME FRAME AS ALL THE RECALLED VEHICLES.   I WOULD EXPECT FOR DC TO INCLUDE MY VEHICLE IN THIS RECALL AND REMEDY THE DEFECT IN THEIR COMPONENT BEFORE ANYBODY GETS HURT.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP.

SINCE THIS PAST OCTOBER, I HAVE EXPERIENCED A MYRIAD OF PROBLEMS WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:    1. A BROKEN VENTILATION DEFLECTOR WHICH PREVENTS ANY AIR FROM COMING THROUGH THE VENTILATION.  I SPENT NEARLY $100.00 TO FIND OUT THAT IT IS A $37.00 PART WITH $500.00 IN LABOR JUST TO INSTALL IT.  I HAVE CHILDREN IN THE CAR, AND THE SUMMER HEAT OF 100+ DEGREES IS IN MY MIND, DANGEROUS.  2.  ALL OF THE PASSENGER DOORS CANNOT BE OPENED EITHER MANUALLY OR REMOTELY FROM THE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE.  I RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE TO REPLACE THE LOCK ACTUATORS AT A STAGGERING COST OF $500.00 PER LOCK!  THE DOORS CAN\u0019T BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE OR FROM THE INSIDE WITHOUT SYSTEMATICALLY UNLOCKING THE DOORS WITH THE REMOTE, THEN REACHING IN FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THEM FROM THE INSIDE.  IT DOESN\u0019T TAKE A GENIUS TO SEE THAT THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF I HAPPEN TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE PASSENGERS (CHILDREN) ARE UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE JEEP MECHANIC SAID THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH JEEPS FOR QUITE A WHILE.    3. THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR BROKE WHEN MY WIFE WAS ADJUSTING THE ANGLE OF THE MIRROR.  THERE IS NOW NO TENSION TO HOLD THE MIRROR IN PLACE.      ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS BEGAN 8 MONTHS AGO AND I AM MORE THAN A LITTLE ANGRY ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY WHEN NONE OF THESE ITEMS ARE COVERED PAST THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY.   ALL TOLLED, I AM LOOKING AT SPENDING SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF $3000.00 TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS.      RIGHT NOW I AM EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER, AND EXPECT SOME HEALTHY MEASURE OF COOPERATION FROM JEEP.*AK",

I TOLD THEM I HAD A 1995 GRAND CHEREKEE THAT HAD OVER 100 THOUSAND MILES AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH ROTARS SO WHY DIDN'T THE MANUFACTURER JUST USE THE 1995 PART BUT, AGAIN, I WAS ASSURED THE NEW ROTARS WERE DIFFERENT AND DEFECT FREE. NOW I HAVE 49,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND IT IS AGAIN AT THE DEALER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTERER SAY THEY WILL NOT MAKE ANY FURTHER REPAIRS.THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME I HAD THREE OPTIONS. ONE,THEY WOULD REPLACE THE ROTARS  FOR $240.00. TWO,DO NOTHING BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER ASSURES ME THAT THE PROBLEM DOES NOT EFFECT SAFETY OR MAINTENANCE FOR ANY OTHER PARTS ON THE VEHICLE.(WHICH BY THE WAY I FIND TO BE A LUDICROUS STATEMENT AND A CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN CONSUMERS LET ALONE OTHERS ON THE ROAD SINCE THE CAR BECOMES VERY HARD TO CONTROL WHEN THE FRONT END IS SHAKING VIOLENTLY) AND THIRD, I COULD BUY THE PART FROM A NON-DEALER AT AFTER MARKET PRICES AND GET ROTARS MADE OF A DIFFERENT AND PRESUMABLY STRONGER MATERIAL.

I DRIVE LONG DISTANCES AND PUT A LOT OF MILES ON A VEHICLE. I WENT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST $378. PLUS TAX TO HAVE REPAIRED. I ALSO TALKED TO A CHRYSLER REP ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT WAS TOLD THAT THEIR SEATS WERE MADE FOR AVERAGE SIZE PEOPLE ( I AM 275 LBS) AND THEY WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THE NEW UNIT WOULD NOT ALSO BREAK. I ASKED WHAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE AVERAGE SIZE AND GOT NO ANSWER BUT THAT HER HUSBAND WAS MY SIZE AND SHE CONSIDERED 275 TO BE AVERAGE BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT IS CONSIDERED AVERAGE BY HER COMPANY. WHEN THE FIRST UNIT BROKE I WAS ONLY 240. I TOLD HER THIS SEEM TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE UNIT BREAKING UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS AND I ASKED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I HAD A REAR END COLLISION, IS THE ENERGY FROM THE CRASH GOING TO SEND ME FLYING THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW BECAUSE THE SEAT RAIL ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP FROM BREAKING? HER ANSWER WAS THAT THEIR SEATS WERE MADE TO NATION SAFETY STANDARDS.  I FIND THIS PROBLEM UNNERVING THAT THE RAIL JUST BREAKS WITHOUT ANY UNDUE STRESS AND I AM BEING BLAMED FOR THE PROBLEM FOR MY SIZE.

THIS IS NOT A NEW SITUATION AND NHTSA NEEDS TO STEP IN, THESE ARE THE BRAKES OF OUR CAR.

I HEARD THAT CHRYSLER WILL REPLACE THE BRAKES BECAUSE THE FACTORY ROTORS ARE INADEQUATE FOR THE VEHICLE UNDER SOME TYPE OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION EFFORT BUT WILL ONLY OFFER THIS OF THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINS VIGOURSLY.   ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATUION THAT YOU COULD SUPPLY WOULD BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE TO ME WHILE I ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  FYI - I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BUT ROTORS ARE A \"NORMAL WEAR\" ITEM. I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT IF THE FACTORY ROTORS ORIGINALLY SUPPLIED ON THE VEHICLE WERE \"NORMAL\" AND THE FACTORY BRAKES WERE ADEQUATE FOR THE VEHICLE. IN MY OPINION, THE FACTORY SUPPLIED BRAKES SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER SOME TYPE OF DEFECTS IN MATERIALS OR WORKMANSHIP.  MY RESEARCH HAS UNCOVERED THAT THE ROTORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE.

BASED ON PREVIOUS RECALLS, TALKING TO DEALERS, BRAKE REPAIR SHOPS AND READING MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL SCHOOL VAN TRAVELING WITH STUDENTS HAVING A WRECK BECAUSE OF ROTOR FAILURE, IT IS MORE THAN OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS A KNOWN SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH INFERIOR/UNSAFE BRAKE ROTORS.

IT DOESN'T TAKE A REAL BRIGHT PERSON TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE STEERING AND BRAKING SYSTEM ON A CAR FAILS WHILE TRAVELING AT NORMAL SPEEDS AND IN MY CASE ON TREACHEROUS MOUNTAIN ROADS THAT SERIOUS ACCIDENTS MAY AND WILL RESULT.

APPLICATION OF BOTH FEET TO BRAKE PEDAL DIDN'T STOP THE ACCELERATION AND PROBLEM VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS IT APPEARED. ALL INDICATIONS NOMINAL AFTER THE EVENT, BUT AM NOW VERY CONCERNED OF PERSONAL LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INJURY. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THE ACCELERATOR WAS NOT TOUCHED. ONE OTHER DETAIL I MIGHT MENTION IS THAT  AS I WAS ENGAGING THE BRAKE PEDAL TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE, SOMETHING REGISTERED THAT THE PEDAL \"FELT FUNNY\". I'VE ATTEMPTED TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM... USING THE BRAKE WITH THE ENGINE OFF TO REMOVE ANY VACUUM ASSIST, THEN STARTING... NORMAL SHIFTS FROM PARK TO REVERSE... NOTHING. MY PROFESSION AND TRAINING ALLOWS ME TO BE SOMEWHAT OBJECTIVE IN THIS MATTER. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOMEHOW THE PEDAL \"FEELING\" FOR THE BRAKES AND THE INSTANT THROTTLE INCREASE ARE RELATED. SINCE THERE IS NO MECHANICAL CONNECTION, IT WOULD LEAD ME DOWN THE PATH OF AN ELECTRONICS MALFUNCTION.

I SPOKE TO THE HUFFINES SERVICE REP ON MAY 15, 2001 WHILE THE CAR WAS IN FOR A WARRANTY REPAIR , AT 15000 MILES, AFTER IT HAD LOST ALL POWER. (DISTRIBUTER PROBLEM). HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE ROTORS, THRU FAST COOLING, TENDED TO WARP WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT AND IT WAS TYPICAL OF MANY CARS (EVEN HIS FORD DID IT, HE SAID).  AGAIN, IN JUNE , 2001, I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM , ELDORADO, TO HAVE A WHINING NOISE ,. THE WHINING NOISE TOGETHER WITH THE WORSENING VIBRATION WHEN BRAKING CONCERNED ME AND TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER WHERE PURCHASED. THEY FOUND NOTHING AND ASSURED ME THAT THE VIBRATON WAS TYPIUCAL AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, .HE SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE WAY IN WHICH I MANAGE THE BRAKES WHEN STOPPING. SINCE , THE VIBRATION HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO STAY IN MY LANE STOPING AND IT IS VERY SCARY.  I NOW HAVE 26,000 MILES AND AFTER RESEARCHING AND GOING TO A N INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, I DISCOVER THAT IT IS APPARENTLY A MANUFACTUERS PROBLEM WITH THE EQUIPMENT AND IN ORDER TO FIX, I MUST BUY NEW ROTORS AND PADS, PROBASBLY FOR FRONT AND BACK. I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAVE A 1999'S HAVE HAD TO HAVE THEIRS REPLACED AT VERY LOW MILEAGE. ONE OF THEM IS ON THEIR THIRD SET, AS ARE MANY LISTED ON THE NT WEB SITE. BRAKES SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER AND WITH SUCH A DANGEROUS PROBLEM, YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED.  WHILE THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT ON THE PROBLEM I LEARNED FROM THE SALES CUSTOMER SEERVICE REP AT THE DEALER THERE IS NOT YET ANY RECALL AND ACCORDING TO THE REP IT IS A TYPICAL PROBLEM. SHE IN FACT HAD HER REPLACE AT 14,000 MILES THE FIRST TIME AND THREE TIMES SINCE.. THIS IS A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM AND IT WOULD SEEM FROM A LIABILITY PERSPECTIVE THE MANUFACTUER WOULD WANT TO FIX .*AK",

AFTER A SHORT TIME MY VEHICLE, ON ITS OWN, BACKED INTO ANOTHER JEEP PARKED IN THE INTERSECTION BEHIND ME. AT THE TIME I BELIEVED I LEFT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL. SOMETIME TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR I READ OF A PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL STATING THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO STAY IN PARK BUT THE ARTICLE FURTHER STATED IT WAS FOR MODEL YEARS UP TO 1999 ONLY. SUBSEQUENTLY I READ THAT LATER MODELS ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM (A FLAT SPOT BETWEEN PARK AND REVERSE CAUSING THE TRTANSMISSION TO HOLD THE VEHICLE IN PARK WITHOUT THE DETENT LOCKING IT IN PARK). WITH THIS INFORMATION I TRIED TO SIMULATE THE PROBLEM ON MY VEHICLE. TO MY SURPRISE I COULD EASILY SHIFT THE TRANSMISSION ONTO THE FLAT SPOT WITHOUT THE PARK DETENT LOCKING INTO PARK AND WITH JUST THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE SHIFTING LEVER CAUSE THE TREANSMISSION TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE. THIS COULD ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. I NOW QUESTION IF THE SECOND PART OF MY ACCIDENT (MY VEHICLE BACKING INTO THE CAR BEHIND MINE) WAS CAUSED BY THIS DESIGN FLAW IN THE TRANSMISSION. I REPORTED MY FINDINGS TO THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER BUT WAS TOLD \"...TO TALK WITH THE BODY SHOP THAT REPAIRED THE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE\" (I DID NOT TSLK WITH THE BODY SHOP AS THIS SOLUTION SOUNDED RIDICULOUS).*AK",

SEVEN MONTH LATER, ON 6/01/2001, SAME PROBLEM.  DEALER RESURFACED FRONT AND BACK ROTORS AND CHARGED US AN $80.00 (DEDUCTABLE) FEE, WITH THE BALANCE PAID BY DAIMLER CHRYSLER AS GOOODWILL.  SIX MONTHS LATER, 12/14/2001 (15,314 MILES) WE ASKED THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE ROTORS SINCE THE LAST FIX, ONLY 6 MONTHS AGO DID NOT LAST.  THEY TOLD US WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER $200 TO REPLACE THE FRONT ROTORS.  WE WERE TOLD BY \"PAT\" THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT THEY NOW HAD A \"PERMANENT\" FIX TO THIS WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM.  WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT IN AND ON 12/20/2001, WHILE DRIVING ON SNOW PACKED ROADS THE VEHICLE WAS UNUSUALLY DIFFICULT  TO STOP.

NOT BEING A PARTICULARLY COMPLAINT ORIENTED PERSON, I AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM ON THIS TRUCK TO THE FACT THAT I HAD NEVER OWNED A 4WD VEHICLE BEFORE.  FROM THE OUTSET THIS TRUCK SHUDDERED WHEN IN A TIGHT TURN, EITHER DIRECTION. DURING THE FIRST WINTER II OWNED IT, I LEFT IT IN MY DRIVEWAY IN PARK ONLY TO COME OUT LATER TO FIND IT AT THE END OF MY DRIVE. THIS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF TIMES, ONCE STOPPING ONLY BECAUSE IT STOPPED UP AGAINST MY WIFE'S CAR. I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY AT FIRST--NOW I WON'T LEAVE THIS VEHICLE ON A FLAT SURFACE WITHOUT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON.  RECENTLY, THE TRUCK DEVELOPED A HUGE, AND FRIGHTENING \"CLUNK\" BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD GEAR I BELIEVE. AGAIN, I DID NOT MAKE MUCH OF THIS UNTIL THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT CAME ON MORE OR LESS PERMANENTLY. THE TRUCK WILL NO LONGER SHIFT INTO APPROPRIATE GEAR, HAS POOR ACCELERATION AND WORSENING GAS MILAGE, AND RUNS AT ERRATIC AT BEST RPMS. I HAVE TAKEN IT TOO THE DEALER WHO ON THE FIRST VISIT TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK WHEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN. IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON THE WAY OUT THE LOT. I TOOK THE TRUCK BACK ABOUT A WEEK LATER  AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ABOUT $250 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. A WEEK LATER, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER, ANGRY THAT I HAD FOUND MY EXACT PROBLEM ON A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLITEN FROM CHRYSLER ITSELF. THE DEALER ALTHOGH VERY NICE BASICALLY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED AT A COST OF SOME (AT LEAST) $3,000.00. I AM TAKING THE CAR BACK NEXT WEEK TO HAVE THE DEALER TEAR DOWN THE TRANSMISSION, AFTER HAVING ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO THE DISTRICT MANAGER, WHO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARRED UPON MY ARRIVAL. HAVING READ NOW VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS TO MINE ON THIS INTERNET SIGHT, I AM NOW TORN BETWEEN LETTING THEM REPAIR IT TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE NO AVAIL , FILING A LAWSUIT, OR TRADING THE VEHICLE IN AND LOSING A TON OF MONEY.

DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED THAT SHAKING AND PULSATIONS WERE DUE TO DEFECTIVE ROTORS WHICH HAD WARPED FROM EXCESSIVE HEAT - NOT DUE TO EMERGENCY BRAKING, BUT JUST NORMAL USE.  DEALERSHIP REPLACED ROTORS AND PADS WITHOUT COST TO CUSTOMER.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE SAME PROBLEM AROSE SOON AFTER MY FIRST ANNIVERSAY WITH THE VEHICLE AT ABOUT 17,500 MILES.  TOOK TO SAME DEALERSHIP AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE SAME PROBLEM (ROTOR WARPING DUE TO OVERHEATING - NOT FROM ABUSIVE BRAKING, BUT FROM NORMAL BRAKING BY CUSTOMER).  THEY REPAIRED THE PROBLEM BY RESURFACING FRONT ROTORS AND REPLACING FRONT PADS WITHOUT COST TO THE CUSTOMER (EXCELLENT SERVICE DEPARTMENT).  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REP STATED THAT THE SAME PROBLEM WOULD COME UP AGAIN AFTER ABOUT 8-10,000 MILES BECAUSE THE ROTORS AND BRAKING SYSTEM ARE DEFECTIVE FROM THE MANUFACTURER.  HE STATED THAT JEEP AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO \"BUMP HEADS\" BEFORE THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENTLY CORRECTED.  PLEASE MAKE JEEP ACKNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED.  JEEP NEEDS TO STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCT IF IT WISHES TO MAINTAIN ITS RATHER GOOD REPUTATION.  IF NOT, JEEP WILL LOSE ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND WILL EVENTUALLY GO THE WAY OF THE DODO BIRD.  THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE EXPERIENCED IS THE MALFUNCTIONING OF THE MY REAR TRUNK DOOR LOCK.  IT GETS STUCK QUITE OFTEN, SUCH THAT I CANNOT DISENGAGE THE LOCK TO OPEN THE  TRUNK.

THE CAR THEN ACCELERATED UNEXPECTEDLY AND CATAPULTED THEM THROUGH OUR GARAGE DOOR AND INTO OUR OTHER PARKED CAR WHICH WAS INSIDE OUR ONE-CAR GARAGE.  MY WIFE HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT 1 1/2 MONTHS EARLIER ABOUT THE JEEP SURGING FORWARD AFTER IT BEING PLACED IN \"PARK\" AND THE FOOT BEING REMOVED FROM THE BRAKE.

THE ROTORS WERE RESURFACED AND THE PROBLEM WAS ELIMINATED. THE CERTIFIED JEEP MECHANIC WHO FIZED MY VEHICLE STATED THAT HE HAS NOTICED  AN UNUSUALL AMOUNT OF JEEP VEHICLES THAT NEED THEIR ROTORS RE-SURFACED WHEN HAVING LOW MILEAGE. I SEE THAT AS A DEFECT SINCE I HAVE OWNED MANY NEW CARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE SEEN WHERE ROTORS HAVE TO BE RE-SSURFACED SO SOON. MY JEEP IS OWNED BY MY WIFE AND IT IS OUR FAMILY VEHICLE WHICH IS DRIVEN WITHIN IN NORMAL LIMITS. EVEN MY POLICE CAR THAT I DRIVE AT WORK (WHICH IS  DRIVEN HARD) DOES NOT NEED IT'S ROTORS RE-SURFACED YET. I HAVE ALSO RE-SEARCHED AND FOUND THAT OTHER JEEP OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH ROTORS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. IN ALL MY DRIVING, I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A TENSE MOMENT WHEN I TRIED TO BRAKE TO NEGOTITATE THAT CURVE.
