MY WIFE WAS NOT ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE WHEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP ACCORDING TO HER.  SHE WAS NOT DISTRACTED AND FELT LIKE THE VAN SHE WAS DRIVING HAD AMPLE ROOM TO STOP.  THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING UP AN INCLINE ON A HIGHWAY, TRAFFIC CAME TO AN ABRUPT STOP.  THE VEHICLE MY WIFE HAD THE WRECK IN IS A RENTAL VEHICLE, HOWEVER; SHE HAD DRIVEN IT FOR THREE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE UNFAMILIARITY OF THE RENTAL COULD HAVE HAD A PART TO PLAY IN THE ACCIDENT, HOWEVER; THE STOP WAS ON AN INCLINE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE INCLINE WOULD HAVE HELPED WITH THE STOP AND SOMEWHAT COUNTERACTED SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF BEING UNFAMILIAR WITH THE CAR.  MY WIFE SUSTAINED BRUISES AND SWELLING IN THE ANKLES, KNEES AND WRISTS AS WELL AS SOME NECK INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.  I AM NOT AWARE OF THE INJURIES OF THE OTHER PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.  MY COMPLAINT IS NOT TO REDIRECT BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE VEHICLE.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THESE VANS HAVE A KNOWN ISSUE WITH BRAKING DISTANCE FALLING OUTSIDE ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS.  A FLAW IN THE BRAKING MAY NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT BUT, FROM A LOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, GIVEN THE FACTS MY WIFE'S REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND READING THE RECALL DETAILS FOR THIS YEAR AND MODEL VAN, IT IS A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY.  MY HOPE IS THAT THE WRECK WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A MANUFACTURING FLAW AND THAT THE DRIVERS OF THESE VANS ARE SAFE WITH NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.  THANK YOU",
