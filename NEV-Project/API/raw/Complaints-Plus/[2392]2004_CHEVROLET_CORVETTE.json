I had the vehicle looked at and it has a fuel leak where the quick connectors connect to the fuel tanks. Anyhow, there's a special coverage adjustment which extended the warranty to 10 yrs/100,000 miles.  I'm obviously outside of those parameters, but I feel that since the manufacturer admitted fault and stated that my particular VIN is affected, they should be held accountable for fixing a safety issue with my vehicle.  How they got away with issuing a special coverage adjustment for such an issue rather than a simple recall is beyond me.",

No reply after it was requested that I take the Corvette to my local dealership for diagnosis.  The ECL motor is not working property, causing the steering wheel to lock up and fuel supply to shut off.  Sent attachment with diagnosis; however, no reply.    GM indicated that this was previously fixed, but it obviously was not.  My assertion is that there should not be a expiration date on safety recalls, and the ECL motor is not working properly creating a very dangerous situation. This happens every time that I drive the car.  There have been several instances of me starting the car, pulling into traffic, and then the car shuts down.  It has been very scary as I pull the key and wait 10 seconds to restart the car.  Sometimes I have to do it twice.  It is my contention that GM should be responsible for fixing this problem that was previously identified by GM as an issue/concern.",

AFTER TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES FROM THE GAS STATION, I NOTICED A GAS LEAK UNDERNEATH COMING FROM THE LEFT DRIVER'S SIDE NEAR THE GAS TANK AREA.  AFTER DISCOVERING THE PROBLEM, I IMMEDIATELY DROVE THE CAR TO A CHEVROLET SERVICE DEALERSHIP. AFTER HAVING A CERTIFIED GM MECHANIC LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM, THEY DISCOVERED IS WAS A DEFECTIVE TANK CONNECTOR (CROSSOVER PIPE) THAT CRACKS UNDER STRESS.  WHAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED WAS THE O-RING SEALS AND CONNECTOR PIPE ($250).  THE LABOR CHARGE FOR REPLACING THESE PARTS ON A 2004 CORVETTE WAS $845. IT IS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN 2003 TO 2004, GM HAD THESE CROSSOVER PIPES CHANGED FROM A RUBBER TO A STEEL MATERIAL BECAUSE OF GAS AND HIGHWAY EMISSIONS.  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE STATEMENT TO EVERY OWNER OF 2004 CORVETTE, THAT THERE IS IN FACT A DEFECTIVE CROSSOVER PIPE THAT WILL LEAK GASOLINE AND WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE A FIRE HAZARD IF IT IS NOT REPLACED. *TR",

IT ONLY DRIPS WHEN IT HAS BEEN DRIVEN BUT IS NOW QUITE BAD.  I HAVE NOT DARED DRIVE IT FOR THE LAST WEEK.  IT HAS NOT BEEN WORKED ON BECAUSE I WAS ADVISED TO CALL GM TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP OUT ON THIS COSTLY REPAIR.  I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM AS YET.  THE GM REP DID ASK ME TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SELLER FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION EVEN THOUGH ANOTHER DIVISION OF THEIR COMPANY HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AND EVEN SHOWED ME THE LEAKING LOCATION.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS GAS NOW DRIPS ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT REAR TIRE.

THE FUEL GAUGE READ  OF A TANK. AFTER A SHORT TIME PERIOD THE FUEL QUITS LEAKING. I AM GUESSING THAT I HAVE A CRACK IN THE FILL TUBE. COULD SOMETHING ELSE BE GOING ON THAT I AM NOT AWARE OF BESIDES A FILL TUBE CRACK? WOW, OF ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG WITH A CAR, THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME.  THE SECOND TANK CONNECTOR JOINT ON MY CAR IS SPLIT ALSO. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF. THEY PRESSURED UP THE TANK WITH NITROGEN/SMOKE AND SMOKE WAS POURING OUT OF THE CONNECTION JOINT. BAD NEWS...........$2400 TO REPAIR WITH NEW PARTS AND 9 HRS. OF LABOR..........THE GREAT NEWS.. THANK GOD FOR MY GMPP, IT'S COVERED. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WHY GMPP WOULD NOT COVER TO HAVE THE PARTS OVERNIGHTED FOR $100?? THEY WILL PAY THE EXTRA THREE DAYS OF CAR RENTAL INSTEAD, FOR A TOTAL OF 5 DAYS. JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE GOOD BUSINESS SENSE, OH THAT'S RIGHT IT'S GM!!  FURTHER MORE THE CAR ONLY HAS 34K MILES ON IT, NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE. *TR",

CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE RECALL FIXED BOTH TIME AND WAS TOLD THAT THE TOOL TO INSTALL THE PART THAT FIXES THE PROBLEM IS ON BACK ORDER UNTIL JANUARY 2005.    TWICE WHILE DRIVNG THE CAR THE STEERING COLUMN LOCKED UP WHILE THE CAR WAS MOVING NARROWLY AVOIDING AN ACCIDENT.     I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS ABOUT THE SITUATION AND MY CONCERN OF THE CAR EVER BEING SAFE AND MY INABILITY TO TRUST DRIVING THE CAR AT ANY SPEED SINCE BEING SUBJECT TO THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE. THEY DISCUSSED BUYING THE CAR BACK WITH REGIONAL MANAGERS OF WHICH THEY DECLINED TO DO SO.    I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR SINCE APRIL OF 2004 TO PRESENT DAY BECAUSE OF THE 2 EPISODES OF THE LOCKING STEERING COLUMN.     I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR COULD NOT CONSCIENELY SELL OR TRADE IT WITHOUT WONDERING IF ANYTHING RESULTED IN HARM OR DEATH TO AN INNOCENT PERSON.    I FEEL GM SHOULD BUY THE CAR BACK AND RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.",
