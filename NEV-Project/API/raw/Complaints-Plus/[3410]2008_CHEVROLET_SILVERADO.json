THIS RECALL STATED THAT THE PROPELLANT IN THE INFLATOR CAN DEGRADE OVER TIME, ESPECIALLY AFTER LONG TERM EXPOSURE IN HOT AND HUMID REGIONS.    WHEN THIS PROPELLANT DEGRADES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL, THE INFLATOR CAN RUPTURE DURING DEPLOYMENT, CAUSING SERIOUS OR FATAL INJURIES.    AS OF NOVEMBER 2017, THERE IS STILL NO REMEDY AVAILABLE FOR THIS RECALL FOR A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH FOR ME OR MY FAMILY.  I HAVE CALLED ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF A REMEDY SEVERAL TIMES, WITH THE MOST RECENT CALL TAKING PLACE IN AUGUST 2017, WHEN I WAS ASSURED THAT THE SOLUTION WOULD BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF OCTOBER.  IT IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE.    I LIVE IN ALABAMA AND HAVE OWNED MY TRUCK FOR 7 YEARS, SO MY AIRBAG PROPELLANT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO THE EXACT CONDITIONS AND LENGTH OF EXPOSURE THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH AS STATED IN THE RECALL    FURTHERMORE, IT ANGERS ME THAT THE RECALL STATES THAT THIS PROPELLANT, WHEN EXPOSED TO HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, COULD RESULT IN DEATH BUT THEN GOES ON TO STATE THAT \"THE VEHICLE IS PRESENTLY SAFE TO DRIVE\".      I THINK THAT GM AND TAKATA HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO ESTABLISH A REMEDY FOR THE PROBLEM.  IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT NEITHER COMPANY CARES ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.

THE DASHBOARD WILL FLASH ON AND OFF FOR A FEW MORE SECONDS.  ABOUT EVERY THIRD TIME THIS HAPPENS, IF I PARK THE CAR AND TRY TO RESTART IT IT WON'T TURN OVER.  IN THESE INSTANCES, I CAN HEAR CURRENT CYCLING THROUGH MY POWER DOOR LOCK SWITCH ALONG WITH AN ELECTRIC CLICKING NOISE THAT WON'T STOP.  IF I LET THE TRUCK SIT FOR 15 MINUTES OR SO, I CAN GET THE TRUCK TO RESTART.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED A COUPLE OF TIMES BECAUSE I COULD NEVER GET IT TO TURN OVER.  THIS PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED WHEN THE TRUCK WAS 3-4 YEARS OLD AND STILL UNDER WARRANTY. THEY COULDN'T FIND THE ISSUE AND DIDN'T REPLACE ANY PARTS.  NOW ALL THE REPAIRS ARE COMING OUT OF MY POCKET.  I'VE REPLACED THE BATTERY A COUPLE TIMES THINKING I HAD A FAULTY BATTERY.  LATER I REPLACED THE BATTERY CABLE THINKING THIS WAS THE CAUSE AND MOST RECENTLY REPLACED THE FUSE BOX.  IN ALL INSTANCES, THE PROBLEM WOULD GO AWAY FOR ANYWHERE FROM 3-6 MONTHS AND THEN REAPPEAR.  AS I SAID IT IS VERY INTERMITTENT WITH NO CONSISTENCY TO IT WHATSOEVER.    MY TRUCK HAS NEVER DIED WHILE DRIVING WHEN THIS HAS OCCURRED, ALTHOUGH I'M SCARED TO DEATH IT WILL DO SO AND I'LL LOSE ALL POWER.

ITS NOW IDLING VERY ROUGH, RPM GAUGE DOES NOT STAY CONSISTENT AT IDLE AND AT ONE POINT DROPPED ALMOST TO 0, TRUCK ALMOST SHUT OFF AND THEN JUMPED BACK UP.

BULB WAS BURNED AT THE CONNECTORS.  FURTHER REVIEW IT WAS NOTICED THAT EACH TAIL LIGHT HAD WATER IN THE BOTTOM.   TRAVELING CAUSED THE WATER TO SHORT OUT AND DAMAGE THE BULB, LEAVING ME WITH NO REAR LIGHTING RANDOMLY.

ON APRIL 14, 2009 VEHICLE #2 WAS BEING DRIVEN DOWN A STEEP HILL AND THE BRAKES BARELY STOPPED THE TRUCK DUE TO THE ROTORS BEING WARPED AND OVERHEATING. BOTH VEHICLES WERE TAKEN INTO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY AND A COMPLAINT #71-716924191 WAS FILED WITH CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE NATIONAL LINE. VEHICLE #1 WAS BEING DRIVEN DOWN A HILL LAST THURSDAY AND THAT VEHICLE BARELY STOPPED DUE TO BAD ROTORS. WE EXPRESSED TO CHEVROLET THAT THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND THEY SAID THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OF THEIR WARRANTY AND TURNED DOWN THE ROTORS AS NECESSARY AS LONG AS THERE IS STILL SERVICEABLE LIFE LEFT IN THEM. THEY WILL NOT INSTALL ANY BETTER ROTORS NOR WOULD THEY OFFER ANY OTHER SOLUTION. THE DEALER SERVICE ADVISER TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ALL PICK UP TRUCK ROTORS ON VEHICLES THAT FREQUENTLY TRAVEL ON HILLS AND HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH CARS AS WELL. THESE TWO PICK-UP TRUCKS DO NOT NORMALLY TOW ANYTHING, ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON IN THE VEHICLE, AND USUALLY HAVE A FOUR WHEEL ATV ON THE BACK WHICH WEIGHS ABOUT 360 POUNDS WHICH IS LESS THAN TWO OF THREE PEOPLE OCCUPYING A CAB. THE VEHICLES ARE DRIVEN ON SOME FARM LANES AND GET SOME MUD ON THE WHEELS INFREQUENTLY BUT THEY SAID THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ROTORS OVERHEATING. PICKUP TRUCKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED FOR HEAVIER USE \"CHEVY TOUGH IS THEIR ADVERTISING SLOGAN\" AND THESE PICKUPS, DO NOT SEE MUCH HEAVY USE. WE FEEL THIS IS A CONSIDERABLE SAFETY HAZARD OF BRAKE FAILURE AND LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM WELL AFTER THE WARRANTY PERIOD EXPIRES. WE LIVE IN A HILLY AREA WITH MANY STEEP ROADS AND WERE NEVER ADVISED THAT THE TRUCKS COULD NOT WITHSTAND THESE CONDITIONS. *TR",

AFTER TRAVELING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I PROCEEDED APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER 50 YARDS IN AN EFFORT TO FIND A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM.  BEFORE I COULD PULL OVER THE SMOKE INCREASED AND THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BECAME FILLED WITH HEAVY SMOKE.  I STOPPED IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND USED ONSTAR TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE THEN EXITED THE VEHICLE AND OPENED THE HOOD TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM.  I SAW HEAVY SMOKE AND FLASHES OF FIRE COMING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE NEAR THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.   THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER TURNING THE ENGINE OFF AND THE SMOKE CLEARED AND/OR STOPPED AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.  AFTER THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT CLEARED THE VEHICLE TO BE MOVED, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND GOT TOWED BACK.  AFTER A BRIEF INVESTIGATION THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT \"A COMPONENT OF THE TRANSMISSION WAS EITHER IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY DURING ASSEMBLY OR IMMEDIATELY FAILED IN THE FIRST 30 MILES THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN DRIVEN.  THIS FAILURE RESULTED IN TRANSMISSION FLUID BEING SPRAYED DIRECTLY ONTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEREBY CAUSING THE FIRE.\"   *TR",
