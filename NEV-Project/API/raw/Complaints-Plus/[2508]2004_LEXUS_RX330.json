I arrived at my destination and parked the vehicle for about two hours. I did not turn the seat heater back on when you returned to the vehicle. I was removing snow from the vehicle with the driver\u2019s door open and some of the snow landed on the driver\u2019s seat. When I brushed the snow off the seat, I noticed a burn mark in the seat cushion. I called Lexus USA to report this 2 days later and showed my local dealer (Lexus of Portland) and they had never seen this before. Here is the response from Lexus today: \"In response to your concerns, a vehicle inspection was conducted by a Lexus Field Technical Specialist (FTS) on January 19, 2022 at Bud Clary Toyota of Yakima. A visual inspection confirmed there was a small 6mm x 7mm burn hole in the driver\u2019s seat leather cover on the bottom cushion. The hole was in the outer bolster portion of the bottom cushion. Resistance was checked through the seat warmer grid. The seat back was recorded at .7 ohms and the seat bottom had an open circuit. The seat cover was removed to examine the seat heater grid. Two wires were found near each other at the burn area. One wire was broken at the location. Our FTS disconnected the seat heater switch after the inspection was completed.\" They left me with now 2 non functioning seat heaters by disconnecting it during a cold winter.  They did not offer any sort of assistance or recommendations for next steps, I feel like they hung me out to dry.",

WOULD THE STICKINESS OF THE DASH CAUSE THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT TO FAIL SINCE IT CAN STICK TO THE DASH DUE TO IT'S NEWLY ACQUIRED ADHESIVE PROPERTIES?  VISIBILITY CONCERNS ARISE DUE TO THE REFLECTIONS OF THE DASH ON THE WINDSHIELD.  SINCE THE DASH CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT CLEAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING STICKS TO IT, BOTHERSOME REFLECTIONS ARE CAST ON THE WINDSHIELD DURING CERTAIN LIGHTING CONDITIONS.  THE LOCAL LEXUS DEALERSHIP AND LEXUS CORPORATE WAS NOTIFIED AND THEY INSPECTED THE VEHICLE.  THEY SAID THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND SINCE MY VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN SERVICED AT THE DEALERSHIP, THEY WOULD NOT PAY TO REPLACE THE DASH; THEY DID OFFER A 25% DISCOUNT FOR THE COST OF THE PARTS.

WE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL LEXUS DEALERSHIP TO ASK IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE, AND WAS ADVISED THEY COULD CHECK TO SEE IF THE PREVIOUS 1ST OWNER OF VEHICLE HAD EVER \"UPGRADED\" THE COMPUTER CHIP THAT CONTROLS THE SYSTEM. SO, WE TOOK IT IN AND THEY DETERMINED IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE SO WE PAID THE $100.00 FOR THE UPGRADE. WE HOPED IT HAD SOLVED THE ISSUE, BUT NOW IT IS EVEN WORSE. SEVERAL DAYS AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE BACK, I WAS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY GOING 70 MPH WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON AND ACCELERATED TO CHANGE LANES AND PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE. DURING MY ATTEMPT TO PASS WITH MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR, FOR 5 OR 10 SECONDS THE ENGINE/ TRANSMISSION FROZE AND IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE IN NEUTRAL GEAR, IT DID NOTHING, AND FINALLY WITH MY FOOT ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR IT KICKED BACK INTO GEAR AND I WAS ABLE TO PASS THE VEHICLE TO MY SIDE.

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THEY HAD  COMPLAINTS AND WERE AWARE OF THE ACCELERATION ISSUE, BUT HAD NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH IT \"FREEZING\" LIKE THAT.

I HAVE THE SAME TROUBLE AS ODI ID NUMBER 10314023 EXCEPT MINE BEGAN TO FAIL (CLICK) AT AROUND 39,300 MILES.     I STARTED HEARING A CLICKING SOUND BACK IN JUNE 2008 WHEN I STARTED THE CAR FOR ABOUT 60 SECONDS.  AFTER THE CLICKING STOPPED A LED ON THE DASH BOARD INDICATED THE HYDRAULIC HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT LIFT WAS OFF.  THE CODE THE LEXUS TECHNICIAN READ FROM THE CAR INDICATED AN AIR SUSPENSION CODE C1735 FOR SUSPENSION EXHAUST SOLENOID.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT MY WARRANTY EXPIRED SIX MONTHS EARLIER (MY MILEAGE WAS 39,514).  THE COST TO REPLACE THE SOLENOID WAS $1100 IN 2008.  I WAS SURE A RECALL WOULD BE ISSUED SO I DID NOT PAY TO HAVE IT REPLACED.  OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE RX330 WOULD RISE AND FALL LIKE IT HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN.   AT MY 60,000 MILE CHECKUP THE COST TO REPAIR THE AIR SUSPENSION WAS $3,000.  I DECLINED THE REPAIR AT THAT TIME DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS.   I OPENED A COMPLAINT WITH LEXUS ON JUNE 19, 2012 AFTER A COLLEAGUE OF MINE STARTED HEARING THE FAMILIAR CLICKING SOUND IN HIS 2004 LEXUS RX330.  I ALSO FOUND THE COMPLAINT LISTED ABOVE.  OUR VIN NUMBERS ARE IDENTICAL OUT TO 11 DIGITS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHECK DIGIT (9TH POSITION).  LEXUS MOST DEFINITELY HAS A DEFECT IN THEIR RX330 EXHAUST SOLENOID VALVE CIRCUIT.  I RECEIVED A CALL FROM LEXUS ON JUNE 26, 2012.  THE WOMAN TOLD ME THAT THE DISTRICT PARTS AND SERVICE MANAGER HAD REVIEWED MY LEXUS MAINTENANCE REPORTS FROM THE DEALER AND DENIED MY REQUEST FOR HELP.  I GAVE THE WOMAN THE ODI COMPLAINT NUMBER ABOVE AND ASKED HER TO PLEASE HAVE THE SERVICE MANAGER RESEARCH THE COMPLAINT AND VIN NUMBER BECAUSE THE TWO RX330 AIR SUSPENSION FAILURES MUST BE RELATED!!

WE TRIED TO EXTRACT HER THROUGH THE SEATBELT, BUT IT WAS WOUND TOO TIGHTLY AROUND HER TORSO.  WE TRIED TO RETRACT THE SEATBELT A BIT SO THE LOCKING SYSTEM WOULD RELEASE; HOWEVER,  THE SEATBELT KEPT TIGHTENING AND LOCKING WITH EACH MOVEMENT UNTIL SHE COULD BARELY BREATHE AND THE SEATBELT WAS DIGGING INTO HER MIDSECTION NEARLY 3 INCHES ALL AROUND. SHE WAS LITERALLY BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH. PANICKED, WE SEARCHED THE CAR FOR MY HUSBAND'S SWISS ARMY KNIFE, WHICH LUCKILY HE HAD IN HIS LUGGAGE.

I WAS NOT ON THE PHONE AND HAD NO ALCOHOL OR DRUGS IN MY SYSTEM AND THERE WAS NO PASSENGER IN THE CAR TO DISTRACT ME.  I AM A 58 YEAR OLD  HEALTHY WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR 42 YEARS.   I TOOK THE CAR INTO MY LEXUS DEALER AND THEY CHECKED THE COMPUTER AND CLAIMED THERE WERE NO DEFECTS.   THEY TOLD ME I HAD PROBABLY STEPPED ON THE GAS INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE OR THE FLOOR MAT HAD GOTTEN STUCK ON TOP OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.   I CHECKED THE PEDAL (AS DID A CO-WORKER) RIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND THE MAT WAS NOT ON OR NEAR THE PEDAL.   IN ADDITION,  I DO NOT BELIEVE I HIT THE GAS INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE AS THE PARKING SPOT HAD AN UPHILL GRADE AND I MOST LIKELY WAS NOT YET READY TO BRAKE WHEN THE ACCELERATION OCCURRED.  THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY.  MY BROTHER,  WHO IS AN AIRLINE PILOT,  SUGGESTED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE DRIVE-BY-WIRE ELECTRONICS MALFUNCTIONING BUT THE LEXUS DEALER ASSURED ME THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN THE CASE.   NOW,  HEARING ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER ACCELERATION PROBLEMS  I BELIEVE MY COMPLAINT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF LEXUS/TOYOTA UNEXPLAINED  UNINTENDED ACCELERATION PROBLEMS.  IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN IN FRONT OF ME OR IN THE CAR I HIT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY INJURED OR KILLED.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEEM THEM. *TR",

THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED ON A SUNDAY (1/9/10)  SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE ONE TOWING OPPORTUNITY THAT MY INSURANCE COMPANY GAVE ME TO TOW MY CAR TO A NON-LEXUS/TOYOTA BRAND DEALERSHIP.         THE ENGINE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY OIL SLUDGE. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY CAR SERVICED PROPERLY AND I REFUSED TO BE DENIED MY RIGHT TO BE HEARD.

HERE IS THE WEBSITE WITH THE DETAILS FOR THE SETTLEMENT: HTTP://WWW.OILGELSETTLEMENT.COM/       I CALLED LEXUS AND THEY BRUSHED ME OFF SAYING THAT I HAD TO GET THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP AND EVEN THEN THEY WEREN'T OFFERING ANY TYPE OF MAINTENANCE CREDIT AT ALL. I CAN'T AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO HAUL MY CAR ALL OVER TOWN TO MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS COMPANY. I WANT TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE REPAIRS WHICH BY ALL ESTIMATES WILL COST THEM LESS THAN WHAT IT WILL COST THEM AT A DEALERSHIP.

THEY ALL DO IT.\"  IN MID SEPTEMBER, THE VEHICLE WAS IN SERVICE FOR ANOTHER ISSUE, AND A NEW, EAGER SERVICE WRITER DROVE THE VEHICLE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, ABSOLUTELY AGREED THAT THE NOISE WAS CAUSING WEAR ON SOMETHING AND THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BUY THIS VEHICLE WHEN IT COMES OFF LEASE, IF IT DOES THAT!\"  AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE FOR 10 DAYS TO FIX THE OTHER PROBLEM, THE PREVIOUSLY EAGER SERVICE WRITER TOLD US HE HAD DRIVEN OTHER RX'S ON THEIR LOT, AND APPARENTLY THE PROBLEM IS A \"NORMAL\" ONE.  OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE BEEN DRIVING A VERY UNSAFE VEHICLE AND LEXUS/DEALER DON'T CARE.  UNTIL SOMEBODY DIES, POTENTIAL LEXUS CUSTOMERS BEWARE!! *NM",

WITHIN A 1/2 HOUR, WHILE TESTING THE SAFETY FEATURES OF VEHICLE, I HAD PLACED A LARGE STUFFED ANIMAL (IN PLACE OF A HUMAN BODY PART OF A ADULT OR CHILD). ALTHOUGH ALL THE WINDOWS AND  REMOTE REAR DOOR AUTOMATICALLY OPENED WHEN COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FOREIGN OBJECT ( STUFFED BEAR), THE SUNROOF JAMMED THE BEAR BETWEEN THE CLOSING GLASS AND FRAME I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE STUFFED ANIMAL STILL JAMMED IN THE SUNROOF BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN WERE UNABLE TO DISLODGE THE STUFFED ANIMAL'S HEAD FROM THE JAMMED SUNROOF (IMAGINE IF THIS WAS A CHILD'S BODY PART???) AND HAD TO DISMANTLE THE SUNROOF TO REMOVE THE STUFFED ANIMAL AND HAD ME RETURN ON THE 12TH DETERMINE THE CAUSE AND TO FIX THE SUNROOF.  SINCE THAT TIME, THIS SAME VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPAIRED BY THE SAME LEXUS DEALERSHIP A MINIMUM OF 6 TIMES FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE SUNROOF. ALL THE WHILE I WAS RETURNING WITH THE VEHICLE TO BE GET SUNROOF REPAIRED, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD REPORTED THIS OBVEROUS SAFETY DEFECT THAT A FOREIGN OBJECT (STUFFED BEAR OVER 2 1/2' IN LENGTH AND AS SOFT AS A CHILD'S HAND) WOULD GET JAMMED BETWEEN THE CLOSING GLASS AND THE FRAME OF THE SUNROOF WITHOUT A SAFETY FEATURE TO AUTOMATICALLY OPEN THE WINDOW IF A FOREIGN OBJECT GETS IN WAY OF CLOSING AS WITH THE REMOTE TRUCK CLOSING SYSTEM AND THE AUTOMATIC WINDOWS THIS VEHICLE IS FACTORY EQUIPPED WITH.  NYS HAS THE LEMON LAWS FOR NEW VEHICLES SOLD THAT ARE DEFECTIVE.  IT WAS DURING THIS PROCESS IN COLLECTING MY SERVICE RECORDS FROM BAYRIDGE LEXUS THAT I DISCOVERED THAT THEY NEVER LOOKED INTO THIS MATTER AS A SAFETY DEFECT, NOR WAS IT REPORTED (TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE) TO ANY OFFICIAL AGENCY THAT CAR MANUFACTURES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT POSSIBLE SAFELTY DEFECTS. *JB",

IT SEEMS LIKE MANY 2004 RX330'S HAVE BEEN HAVE ALOT OF BRAKE ISSUES BUT LEXUS' ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF THE PROBLEM CAN BE FIXED THEN THE CAR IS RUNNING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.  MY QUESTION TO THEM WAS CAN THEY  FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE LOSS OF A LIFE WHEN THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE PRODUCES THAT PROBLEM? I HAVE ALSO HAD TO HAVE BRAKE ROTOR PADS REPLACED AT 15,000 MILES WHICH ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE TECH WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY BUT NOT ACCORDING TO A LEXUS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ADMINISTRATOR.  I FIND IT APPALLING THAT LEXUS IS NOT STANDING BEHIND ITS PRODUCT TO HAVE THESE UNSAFE VEHICLES TAKEN OFF THE ROAD INSTEAD THEY ARE WILLING TO RISK CONSUMERS LIVES NATIONWIDE.... SO MUCH FOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.",

I NEXT ASK HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE IT WOULD BE FIXED, HE RESPONDED BETWEEN 1 AND 3 WEEKS. I ASKED WHY, HE SAID BECAUSE THE PARTS WERE BACK ORDERED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS. THE PART ON MY WORK ORDER IS FOR A BRAKE BOOSTER ASSEMBLY. WHEN THE CAR WAS PICKED UP I ASKED THE TRUCK DRIVER IF HE PICKED UP MANY LEXUS'S FOR BRAKE PROBLEMS THE ANSWER WAS YES. THE VEHICLE WAS FIXED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS BECAUSE I RAISED SO MUCH HECK. THE CAR WAS RETURNED BY A DIFFERENT TOWING SERVICE. I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION AND THIS DRIVER SAID HE HAD 4 IN THE PASSED COUPLE OF MONTHS.     OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, SO I ASKED LEXUS WHY I HAD NOT GOTTEN A LETTER OR RECALL ON IT LIKE I HAD FOR A FAULTY RADIATOR AND BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. ALL PEOPLE TALKED WITH PLAYED IT DOWN.

THE AIR/KNEE BAGS AND ACTIVE SEAT BELT RESTRAINT WERE DEPLOYED, SAVING MY WIFE'S LIFE. THE INVESTIGATION BY THE LEXUS FRONT OFFICE IN TORRANCE REVEALED THAT  VEHICLE WAS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO SPECS. I HAD NOTICED A REVVING NOISE ON DAY ONE OF PURCHASE AND MENTIONED IT TO THE SALESMAN WHO SAID HE WOULD LOOK INTO IT. WITH NO FURTHER INFORMATION THE DEALER SUGGESTED MENTIONING THE PROBLEM AT THE 1000 MILE CHECK-UP. NOTHING ABNORMAL WAS DETECTED, THOUGH MY COMPLAINT WAS RECORDED (APRIL '04). THE REVVING NOISE CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY BUT WITHOUT INCIDENT UNTIL JUNE 30, 2004, THE DATE OF THE CRASH. UPON HEARING OF A LEXUS SUV INCIDENT IN MY TOWN, I DECIDED TO CHECK THE NTSB DATABASE. I WAS ASTOUNDED BY THE CONCENSUS OF COMPLAINTS INVOLVING THE POWER-TRAIN. I HAVE BEEN A LEXUS OWNER SINCE 1995 (SC 300 COUPE) AND HAVE DRIVEN A NUMBER OF RX 300'S AND ONE OTHER RX 330 (AS LOANER VEHICLES).

YOU HAVE TO LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND LET THE RPM'S COME BACK DOWN AND TRY IT AGAIN. THIS HAS ALMOST GOT ME HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE AT LEAST 3 TIMES. ON THE FIRST SERVICE CALL THEY TRIED TO DO A TRANSMISSION \"RESET\" I HAVE DRIVEN THE VEHICLE 2500 MILES SINCE THEN AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORSE. THIS TIME IT WENT TO THE SHOP AND TWO TECHNICIANS, ONE MANAGER, AND ONE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ALL TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIMULATE THE PROBLEM ON TEST DRIVES BUT THAT IT IS \"NORMAL FOR THIS VEHICLE\", HOWEVER, THEY ARE STILL GOING TO REPORT IT TO THE MANUFACTURER. MY RESPONSE IS THAT THIS MAY BE \"NORMAL\" FOR THIS VEHICLE, BUT IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR \"A\" VEHICLE. THEY ALL AGREED BUT SAID THAT LEXUS DOES NOT HAVE A FIX. THIS IS CURRENTLY ELEVATED TO THE LEXUS COMPANY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME. UNTIL THEN I AM STUCK IN A DANGEROUS VEHICLE.   *LA",
