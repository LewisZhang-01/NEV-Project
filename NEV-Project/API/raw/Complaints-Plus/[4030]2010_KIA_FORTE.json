Has this establishment recieved any complaints and if so what is being done to relieve the consumer who has no where to turn and is stuck with a car they cant use and is being ignored by KIA COORPORATION and every one else. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, Thank You",

        "summary": "ON TWO OCCASIONS NOW THE KIA FORTE HAS STALLED WITH THE ORIGINAL FUEL SENDING UNIT LOCATED IN THE FUEL TANK. FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS IN SEPTEMBER 11 2016 (~55,000 MILES) WHERE CAR WAS PARKED FOR ~30 MINUTES WHILE SHOPPING AND WOULD NOT START-INVESTIGATION FOUND THE FUEL PUMP CONNECTOR WITHIN THE FUEL TANK GOT HOT ENOUGH TO MELT THE PLASTIC AND DISCONNECT THE POSITIVE TERMINAL (SEE IMAGES ATTACHED). THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND KIA DEALERSHIPS IN THE CHICAGOLAND AREA WOULD NOT DO ANY WARRANTY REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. AFTER REPAIRING THE CONNECTION AND RE-SOCKETING THE TERMINALS THE PUMP WAS ABLE TO WORK FOR ANOTHER YEAR UNTIL THE SECOND INCIDENT. ON AUGUST 29 2017 (~75,000 MILES) THE VERY SAME CONNECTOR AGAIN WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE FUEL SENDING UNIT FAILED WHILE IN MOTION ON A RESIDENTIAL ROAD CAUSING THE ENGINE TO STALL WHICH IN TURN CAUSED LOSS OF POWER STEERING. AGAIN, THE CONNECTOR FOR PROVIDING POWER TO THE FUEL PUMP OPENED CAUSING THE ENGINE TO BE STARVED OF FUEL. THE UNIT IS NO LONGER REPAIRABLE AS THE OPEN CIRCUIT IS OCCURRING WITHIN THE RIGHT-ANGLE PASS THROUGH THE METAL DIVIDER OF THE INTERNAL PORTION OF THE FUEL TANK. THE ENTIRE UNIT REQUIRED REPLACEMENT EVEN THOUGH ALL OTHER ELEMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY ARE WORKING. OTHER OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THIS EXACT ISSUE HOWEVER THE MANUFACTURER REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POSSIBILITY OF A RECALL. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY MECHANISM ISSUE AND COULD CAUSE ACCIDENTS DUE TO ABRUPT LOSS OF STEERING, ABILITY TO ACCELERATE, AND FIRE HAZARD.",

UPON INSPECTION, THE HOLE WHERE THE VALVE STEM SHOULD RESIDE WAS EMPTY.  THIS IS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE OF THIS TYPE.  PREVIOUSLY, ON FEBRUARY 28TH, 2013, WHILE DRIVING ON A SECONDARY ROAD AT 55 MPH, THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT TIRE FAILED IN THE SAME MANNER.  AT THAT TIME, A COMPLAINT WAS SUBMITTED WITH KIA (CONFIRMATION ID K2441671).  NO RESPONSE OR CONTACT WAS EVER GIVEN BY KIA.    ONCE THE TIRES WERE DISASSEMBLED, AND THE TPMS PARTS EXAMINED, HEAVY CORROSION AND METAL EROSION WAS PRESENT.  AT SOME POINT, THE SECURING NUT LETS GO, AND THE STEM EJECTS INTO THE TIRE, RAPIDLY RELEASING THE AIR.    IF THIS IS AN ISSUE OF INFERIOR METAL BEING USED WITH THE KIA VALVE STEMS, THEN I FEEL THAT A SAFETY RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  THUS FAR THE FAILURES HAVE ONLY CAUSED THE LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, DRIVING ON THE DREADED SPACE-SAVER TIRE, COST OF REPLACEMENT SENSORS AND TIRES, AND RISK OF CHANGING TIRES AT ROADSIDE, BUT SUDDEN LOSS OF CONTROL OF VEHICLES COULD EASILY LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE TO THE DRIVER AND OTHERS SHARING THE ROADWAY.  I AM NOT AWARE HOW COMMON THIS TYPE OF FAILURE MAY BE, BUT IT IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS DANGER THAT COULD BE ELIMINATED OR AT LEAST SIGNIFICANTLY MINIMIZED.  OVER SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES DRIVEN, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A NORMAL VALVE STEM EJECTION, NOR KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS.

THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM THAT CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME, BUT MOSTLY OCCURS DURING OR AFTER GOING UP A SIGNIFICANT HILL, BUT MAY HAPPEN ON LEVEL GROUND.  THERE'S 23,000 MILES ON MY KIA AND IT'S UNDER FULL WARRANTY.  I TOOK THIS TO THE DEALER, THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM OR DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM; THEY SUGGESTED FLUSHING THE TRANSMISSION FOR $150, SO I DID THAT.  IT DID NOT HELP.  IT STOPPED FOR ABOUT A WEEK, THEN IT STARTED SEIZING UP AGAIN, TODAY (3/10/2011) IT SEIZED TWICE ON MY WIFE.  WHAT IT DOES IS NOT ACTUALLY STOP THE CAR, BUT \"FREEZE\" YOU AT ONE SPEED, TYPICALLY EITHER 20MPH OR 45-50MPH IT TAKES UP TO 30 SECONDS TO SHIFT, AND IF YOU ARE PULLING OUT IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC AND IT SEIZES AND WON'T LET YOU GO BEYOND 10-20MPH IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.  THE DEALER SAYS THEY WON'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT LOANER UNTIL NEXT WEEK, SO WE'LL WAIT.  I'M IN NORTHERN UT.  IT'S HAPPENING IN DRY WARM (50-60 DEGREE) WEATHER.  WE HAVE NOT DRIVEN THE CAR SEVERELY, THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT HAPPEN.  THE KIA OWNER'S MANUAL SAYS TO INSPECT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AT 40,000 AND ONLY CHANGE THEN IF NEEDED, SO THE VERY EXPENSIVE FLUID SHOULD BE GOOD.
