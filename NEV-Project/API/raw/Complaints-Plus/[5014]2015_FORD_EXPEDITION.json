The driver pulled over and turned off the engine.  Upon opening the hood, smoke was observed coming from the front passenger floorboard area.  Melting hot plastic was observed dripping from under the dash.  Flames were observed coming from the floorboard carpet. The driver received second degree burns to his fingertips on his right hand while inspecting the vehicle. The fire was extinguished and the car was towed to Maxwell Ford in Austin, Texas for repair.  Ford Motor Company was notified of the incident. The cause of the fire is believed to be related to the air conditioner blower motor, but the cause is still unknown. The car has received routine maintenance and servicing from Ford.",

I turned off the engine and read up on the warning light to learn it indicated a powertrain failure. Called a mechanic who stated it could be the throttle body and/or throttle body actuator.  It was suggested the engine should be turned off (already done) and restarted.  I did as instructed and the engine began running smoothly again.  Wrench warning light was no longer on.  Without having control of the powertrain, this situation could have caused an accident as I had no ability to control the vehicle's power and could not navigate through the intersection in a safe manner.  I feel like my safety and others was put at risk.  I have taken the vehicle to an independent mechanic who is also an Auto Mechanic Instructor at the local high school.  I await his diagnostic result.  There were no earlier symptoms or wrench warning light previous to this incident.",

IF SOME WAS IN THE 3RD ROAD SEAT, AND SOMETHING HAPPENED THEY COULD NOT GET OUT.  AUGUST 1, 2015 I WENT TO THE VET WITH MY DOG IN HER KENNEL IN THE BACK. OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS 93 DEGREES.  I COULD NOT OPEN THE BACK HATCH TO GET MY DOG OUT.  I HAD TO LOWER ALL THE MIDDLE SEATS, OPEN HER KENNEL, AND \"CONVINCE \" HER TO COME OUT AND WALK AROUND .  I HAD TO LIFT HER UP AND PUT HER ON THE GROUND. BEING HANDICAPPED THIS WAS NOT FUN..   OF COURSE AFTER THE VETS VISIT, THE DARN THING WORKED  IT IS DANGERSOUS!!!",
