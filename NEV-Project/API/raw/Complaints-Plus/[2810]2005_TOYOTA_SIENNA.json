The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where he was informed that the Webasto sunroof was an aftermarket part. Upon investigation, the contact associated the failure with NHTSA Campaign Number: 11V042000 (Visibility) however, the VIN was not included. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact called manufacturer Webasto and left them a voicemail but had not yet spoken to a representative. The failure mileage was approximately 186,000.",

All tires showed similar failure mode.. this was on a very hot day. I took the vehicle to Big O tires and had the front two replaced at my expense so the vehicle was drivable. I returned to Discount Tire in Tucson (Speedway) to ask for a recall check after I learned of the 2021 recall on similar Continental tires for sidewall failure. Discount tire reimbursed one tire. I complained to agent Matthew Harby that the other two tires were dangerous because they showed the same sidewall defect on the hot day. He denied my request for replacement if the remaining two Continental tires because there was no open recall on these. I told I him I was worried about a catastrophic failure in normal operation. I then resumed driving. The weather cooled off and until October the two tires behaved normally again..  On 10/30 about 630pm I was dri ong on I10 and experienced catastrophic tire failure in the outside lane speed approx 65mph. I was fortunate to be able to pull over without losing control but the photo shows the extent of this serious failure. I am now at Discount Tire on Ina Road in Tucson requesting replacement of the failed tire and the final remaining CONTINENTAL tire.   The photos should show sufficient evidence of sidewall failure matching the failure mode of the recalled tires. THESE ARE DANGEROUS AND NEED NHTSA ACTION WITH A UNIVERSAL RECALL BEFORE A FATAL EVENT OCCURS",

I have replaced the Yaw sensors and had several alignments and this still happens.  After a lot of research, we have found that this is actually really common in Toyota Sienna.

HE HAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER TWO TIMES AND THEY REFUSE TO HONOR THEIR WORK OR PART. FIRST TIME ON 05/02/2017 WHICH WAS LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER IT WAS REPLACED, NOTED AS BODY/INTERIOR REPAIR ORDER. THEY REFUSED TO REPAIR IT. SECOND TIME WE BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN AT AN OIL CHANGE ON 7/3/2018 THEY ALSO REFUSED. THEY WERE PAID TO INSTALL IT UNDER WARRANTY IT SHOULD COME WITH SOME TYPE OF A WARRANTY WITH THIS INSTALLATION. SEATBELTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE WORN ACROSS OUR LEGS AND ACROSS OUR SHOULDER, NOT OUR NECK. I FEEL SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR MY SAFETY. YOU ATTENTION TO THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATE.

I FOLLOWED UP AGAIN ON DECEMBER 17, 2015, WHEN THEY AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND THAT IT WAS ON ORDER, AND THAT THEY WOULD NOTIFY ME WHEN IT ARRIVED. I FOLLOWED UP BY PHONE A FEW TIMES IN 2016, AND EARLY IN 2017. I GOT THE SAME REPLY EACH TIME I SPOKE WITH MR. KIRKLAND. I THEN FOLLOWED UP AGAIN IN PERSON ON JULY 26, 2017. I GOT THE SAME REPLY FROM MR. KIRKLAND. ON JUNE 11, 2018, I AGAIN SPOKE WITH MR. KIRKLAND REGARDING THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN COMPLETING THIS RECALL WORK. HE PROMISED TO LOOK INTO IT, AND PHONE ME WHEN HE HAD AN ANSWER. I FOLLOWED UP AGAIN WITH MR. KIRKLAND ON JUNE 14, 2018, WHEN MR. KIRKLAND STATED THAT TOYOTA WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO HONOR THIS WARRANTY WORK. I VOICED MY DISPLEASURE ABOUT TOYOTA, AND MR. KIRKLANDS LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM IN RESOLVING THIS WARRANTY SERVICE IN A TIMELY MANNER BACK IN 2015. I ASKED ONE FINAL QUESTION OF MR. KIRKLAND, HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST ME IF I PAID FOR THE DASHBOARD COVER REPLACEMENT? HE GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $2,000.  MORE THAN 50% OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE SIENNA.

SECOND ISSUE: ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS (USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, WHILE ACCELERATING ONTO A HIGHWAY ON-RAMP) THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE, A REPETITIVE BEEPING WILL SOUND, AND THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES AND BECOMES DIFFICULT TO CONTROL SINCE IT FREEZES UP.

I WAS IN A LEFT TURN MERGING LANE FROM ONE MAJOR HIGHWAY TO A BUSY INTERSTATE.  I WAS GOING ABOUT 50 MPH WHEN IT ACTIVATED.  THE ACTIVATION CAUSED MY CAR TO RAPIDLY DECELERATE FROM 50 MPH TO 20 MPH IN A MATTER OF 3 SECONDS AND CAUSED MY WIFE AND I TO LURCH FORWARD.  VSC ALSO CAUSED MY VEHICLE TO SWERVE SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT.  I HAD IMMEDIATELY LOST CONTROL!  THIS PUT ME AND MY FAMILY IN MORTAL DANGER ALONG WITH THE OCCUPANTS OF VEHICLES AROUND US.  THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR MY SUDDEN AND UNWARRANTED STOP!  I BELIEVE TOYOTA HAS SOLD A VEHICLE THAT HAS A HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE ERROR IN IT THAT CAN RESULT IN FATAL INJURIES TO THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS AND OCCUPANTS OF SURROUNDING VEHICLES.  THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD REQUIRE TOYOTA TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL THAT PERMANENTLY ELIMINATES THIS PROBLEM FOR TOYOTA OWNERS LIKE ME.  (AS BACKGROUND, I DID SOME INTERNET RESEARCH TO SEE IF OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.  I'VE ATTACHED MY FINDINGS OF 23 IDENTICAL INCIDENTS EXPERIENCED BY SIENNA OWNERS.  I STOPPED AT 23 - THERE WERE MORE.)  I BELIEVE THIS SITUATION IS FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN YOUR RECENT RECALL OF THE TOYOTA SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENTAL ROLL AWAY.  (NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 13V429000).  IN OUR CASE WE ARE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHEN WITHOUT WARNING THE CAR SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES AND VEERS TO THE RIGHT.  I BELIEVE THIS CALLS FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION.  PERSONALLY, I THINK THIS IS JUST AS SERIOUS AS A CAR GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY THAT SUDDENLY BURSTS INTO FLAMES.  I KNOW YOU WOULD ISSUE A RECALL TO THAT CAR COMPANY AND I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD ISSUE A SIMILAR RECALL TO TOYOTA.",

THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THE DOOR PAST THE CATCH POINT IT WILL NOT RETURN IF YOUR HAND IS IN THE WAY. WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED IT WOULD GO BACK IF YOUR HAND WAS IN THE DOOR.  NOW IF IT GOES BEYOND THAT CATCH POINT IT LUNGES AND WILL CATCH YOUR HAND AND WILL NOT RELEASE.  THE DOORS HAVE BAD HINGES AND CABLES WHICH TOYOTA REFUSES TO ADMIT ARE FAULTY.  THEY OFFER AND EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR YOU KNOWING THAT THE 120,000 MILE LIMIT PUTS MOST OUT OF COVERAGE.  THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GAME TO PUT OFF THE SAFETY OF THE CONSUMER. I HAVE A 17 YEAR OLD DOWNS CHILD.  SHE GETS OUT OF THE VAN EVERY DAY AND HAS TO PUSH THE DOOR SHUT.  SHE HAS TO USE TWO HANDS AND IT IS NOT SAFE.  IF SHE SLIPS HER HAND WILL BE IN THE WAY OF THE DOOR AND IT WILL NOT REOPEN.  I HAVE TRIED TO TALK TO TOYOTA AND THEY JUST SAY WE ARE OUT OF THEIR COVERAGE TIME LIMITS.  I REPORTED THE DOOR WAY BACK IN EARLY 2012. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SCOPE OF THEIR LIABILITY.  AT THAT TIME THEY SAID IT WOULD COST TWO TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR THE FAULTY EQUIPMENT.  I ASK THE OBVIOUS? WHEN DOES THIS STOP?  DO A SEARCH ON GOOGLE FOR SLIDING DOOR PROBLEMS FOR SIENNA VANS AND YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED AT THE BLOGS AND SIGHTS DEDICATED TO THIS ONE ISSUE.  THIS IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY TOYOTA.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS WHEN THE CABLE FOR THE DOOR BREAKS YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE VAN.  WHEN YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE VAN THERE IS A MAJOR MECHANICAL PROBLEM.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO REPLACE THE PARTS CAUSING THIS ISSUE AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.  THE PARTS ARE THE LOCK ACTUATOR,  THE SLIDING HINGE AND CABLES WHICH FAIL AND CAUSES DOOR TO HANG, THE CABLE WHICH WHEN BROKEN RENDERS THE DOOR USELESS. PLEASE HELP!!!  *TR",

THEN IN APRIL, IT BEGAN ACTING UP AGAIN, DOING THE SAME THINGS AS BEFORE, BUT THIS TIME, IT ALSO WOULD SOMETIMES NOT FULLY CLOSE (IT WOULD BE CLOSING ON ITS OWN, BUT BEFORE IT WAS FULLY CLOSED, IT WOULD GO BACK OPEN AGAIN).  WE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON IT BECAUSE WE HAD JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WERE FOCUSED ON THAT.  BUT THEN WHEN WE WERE OUT IN JUNE, WE HAD CLOSED THE DOOR, OR THOUGHT WE HAD, AND CAME OUT OF THE STORE WE WERE IN LATER TO FIND THE DOOR WIDE OPEN.  THAT IS A PROBLEM!  OUR VAN COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN OR THINGS OUT OF IT.  THANKFULLY, GOD WATCHED OVER OUR VEHICLE.  SO WE FINALLY EXPLORED INTO GETTING IT FIXED AND WERE TOLD ABOUT THIS EXTENDED WARRANTY/RECALL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  THE PROBLEM WAS BY THE TIME WE INQUIRED, WE WERE JUST OVER 120,000 MILES, BUT ARE STILL WITHIN THE 9 YEARS (BUT IT IS WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST), SO NOW WE ARE BEING TOLD IT CANNOT BE FIXED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY/RECALL AND WILL COST US $1,900 TO GET IT FIXED.  WE DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY AND ARE VERY UPSET!  WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED BY TOYOTA OF THIS EXTENDED RECALL, OR WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE VAN IN RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE DOOR BEGAN TO ACT UP.  WE ALSO WERE TOLD (FALSELY) BY THE TOYOTA DEALER THAT IT IS 7 YEARS OR 120,000 MILES AND THAT EITHER WAY, WE DON'T QUALIFY.

I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE NEW IN 2005 SO THE ENHANCED WARRANTY EXPIRED IN 2010.

THEY ALSO STATED THAT TOYOTA EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS PROBLEM, HOWEVER DID NOT NOTIFY INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF THIS POTENTIAL BREACH OF INTEGRITY OF THE WELDED PART AND POSSIBLY PUT LIVES OF ITS OWNERS AT RISK ?.  I READ ON THE BLOG THAT THERE ARE 600,000 FIXES THAT TOYOTA HAS MADE RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT MADE A RECALL OR EVEN BOTHERED TO NOTIFY CURRENT OWNERS OF SIENNA.  I REQUEST THAT NHTSA TO TAKE UP THE ISSUE WITH TOYOTA MOTOR CO AND PROVIDE A FAIR AND JUST SETTLEMENT OF THIS ISSUE RATHER THAN GIVING CONSUMERS A RUN AROUND.  I NEED THE HELP OF UNITED STATES GOV.'T. TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS AGAINST THESE IRRESPONSIBLE CORPORATE BEHAVIOR.  *TR",

MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WAS TOLD THAT IF THE AIRBAG SYMBOL IS ON, THE ENTIRE AIRBAG SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN AND DOES NOT WORK!  HOW CAN A SYSTEM SO VITAL TO SAFETY NOT BE COVERED IN FULL BY TOYOTA? THIS VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT.  OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW. I FEEL MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY IS COMPLETELY COMPROMISED. IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM, I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA COMPLAINT HOTLINE (1-800-331-4331) AND OPENED A CASE.   THE ISSUE REMAINS UNRESOLVED.     AFTER ESCALATING, TOYOTA OFFERED TO PAY HALF, BUT I STILL FEEL THAT THIS IS MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES PASSENGER SAFETY AND SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER ONLY FIVE YEARS.  TOYOTA IS SPENDING A GREAT DEAL ON ADVERTISING TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE THEIR COMPANY PLACES ON SAFETY.   I WOULD EXPECT, IF THEIR ADS WERE ACCURATE, THAT SAFETY RELATED ISSUES WOULD BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY BEFORE ANY POTENTIAL HARM. A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH WILL SHOW MANY OTHERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT THE PASSENGER AIR BAG MALFUNCTIONING.  THIS SHOULD REALLY BE ADDED TO TOYOTA'S LISTING OF RECALLS. *TR",

I HAVE, IN THE PAST, DRIVEN ONE TOYOTA TO ALMOST 200,000 MILES WITH LITTLE REPAIR, JUST REGULAR MAINTENANCE!    WHEN THE SIENNA WAS ABOUT 39 MONTHS OLD, WE BEGAN TO HAVE SOME STEERING ISSUES. OCCASIONALLY, IT WOULD BE \"STIFF\" TO STEER. IT WAS STILL DRIVABLE AND AFTER TAKING IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC, WE WERE CONVINCED WE NEEDED NEW TIRES, SO PURCHASED 4 NEW TIRES. THE STEERING ISSUE CONTINUED, HOWEVER, AND BECAME WORSE AND WORSE. WE WERE PERPLEXED BECAUSE THE SIENNA WAS A NEW CAR PURCHASE, GARAGED YEAR ROUND, AND WAS A TOYOTA. WHEN WE RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE ABOUT THE SPARE TIRE RECALL, WE TOOK THE SIENNA TO HALEY'S AUTOMALL IN FARMVILLE, VA FOR REPAIR AND ASKED THEM TO ALSO REPLACE THE TAILGATE STRUTS AND INVESTIGATE OUR STEERING ISSUE.    THE MECHANIC THERE REPLACED THE TAILGATE STRUTS, TOLD US IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, THEN REMOVED THE SPARE TIRE FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE SINCE TOYOTA ADMITTED \"THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF THE SPARE TIRE CARRIER CABLE IS INSUFFICIENT WHEN VEHICLES ARE OPERATED IN AREAS WHERE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ROAD SALT IS APPLIED. IN THE WORST CASE, THE CARRIER CABLE MAY FAIL AND THE SPARE TIRE COULD BECOME SEPARATED FROM THE VEHICLE, A ROAD HAZARD FOR FOLLOWING VEHICLES. \". HE PUT THE TIRE IN THE BACK OF THE MINI VAN, AND THEN TOLD US OUR U-JOINT WAS CORRODED IN OUR STEERING SHAFT FROM THE STEERING COLUMN TO THE STEERING RACK. THE COST FOR REPAIR WAS QUOTED AT $1169.00. SINCE THE RECALL ADMITTEDLY INVOLVED \"INSUFFICIENT CORROSION RESISTANCE\", WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT ALSO HAPPENED TO OUR U-JOINT, CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE STEERING COLUMN AND RACK, WE WERE CERTAIN TOYOTA WOULD ALSO COVER THIS REPAIR, AS CLEARLY A NEW VEHICLE SHOULD NOT HAVE CORROSION OF THIS MAGNITUDE AFTER ONLY 3 YEARS OF USE! *TR",

THE PROBLEM 1ST APPEARED IN MY CAR IN MARCH 2007. THE FOLSOM LAKE TOYOTA DEALER REPAIRED MY VEHICLE BY SENDING IT OUT TO A WELDING COMPANY TO BE REPAIRED. I WAS PROVIDED WITH A RENTAL CAR AT NO CHARGE BY TOYOTA. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFECT, AS STATED ON THE REPAIR SLIP IS AS FOLLOWS: \"...FOUND DOOR DEFORMED AND WELD BROKEN INSIDE DOOR , 23 REPLACED DRIVERS DOOR CHECK, SUBLET TO BODY SHOP FOR REPAIR OF DOOR.\"  I HAVE A COPY OF THIS ORIGINAL REPAIR FORM. THE 2ND TIME THIS DEFECT RE-APPEARED WAS ON JULY 8, 2010. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO TOYOTA CORPORATE, WAS ASSIGNED CASE # 1007081422 AND WAS ADVISED BY THE TOYOTA CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVE THAT THE TOYOTA OF RICHMOND, INDIANA DEALER WOULD BE CALLING ME WITHIN 3 DAYS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO BRING MY CAR IN AND RECEIVE A FREE RENTAL UNTIL MY CAR'S DEFORMITIES WERE FIXED. THE DEALER FAILED TO RESPOND WITHIN 3 DAYS, AND I CALLED CORPORATE AGAIN ON 7-14-10 AND SPOKE WITH CATHERINE. SHE SENT ANOTHER REQUEST TO TOYOTA OF RICHMOND AND SAID THAT I WOULD HEAR FROM THE DEALER WITHIN 24 HRS. AGAIN, TOYOTA OF RICHMOND FAILED TO CONTACT ME. I CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE MOMENTS AGO (7-16-10), AND JESSIE SAID THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEIR DEALERS FIXING TOYOTA DEFECTS AND THAT I SHOULD TRY TO CONTACT THEM MYSELF. TOYOTA HAS A LEGAL AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THEIR KNOWN DEFECTIVE PROBLEMS. AFTER ALL OF THESE FAILED ATTEMPTS TO GET RICHMOND TOYOTA TO CONTACT ME TO INITIATE  THE REPAIR PROCESS, TOYOTA SHOULD BE FINED AND/OR TOYOTA SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING IN THE US MARKETPLACE. THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR IS CLEARLY FALLING OFF AND WILL CAUSE INJURIES WHEN THIS HAPPENS. *TR",

THE SEAT IS LOOSE AND WHEN THE POSITION IS CHANGED, FORWARD OR BACK, THERE IS A GRINDING NOISE LIKE THE GEARS (IT IS ELECTRIC SEAT) ARE NOT MESHING.  MY CONCERN IS IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT THE SEAT WILL COME LOOSE (AS IT MOVERS AROUND NOW) AND I WILL TAKE THE FORCE OF THE SEAT AS WELL AS MY BODY IF IT COMES LOOSE.  THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEAT WILL CHANGE POSITION IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT AND I WILL NOT BE RESTRAINED BY THE SEATBELTS PROPERLY BECAUSE THE SEAT SHIFTED MY POSITION AND IN ADDITION I WILL NOT GET THE FULL EFFECT OF THE AIR BAGS AND AIR CURTAINS WHEN THEY DEPLOY.    WHEN I FOUND THE BOLT I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I HAD NEVER MENTIONED WARRANTY THE SERVICE WRITER BROUGHT IT UP.. I SPOKE WITH TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER THE DEALERSHIP SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND TOYOTA SAID THE SAME THING.  THEY SUGGESTED I BUY A $125 REPAIR MANUAL IF I WANTED TO FIX IT MYSELF.  I ASKED IF THEY WOULD SEND ME A COPY OF THE PAGE THAT PERTAINS TO THE SEAT AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD TRY.  (I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD BY ANOTHER PERSON IN TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THE PERSON WROTE THAT I HAD REFUSED TO BUY THE SERVICE MANUAL. APPARENTLY HE JUST SAID HE WOULD LOOK FOR THE PAGES AND E-MAIL THEM TO ME TO GET ME OFF THE LINE.  HIS NOTE CERTAINLY INDICATES HE HAD NO INTENTION OF HELPING ME GET COPIES OF THE PAGES FROM THE REPAIR MANUAL. )      IT IS OBVIOUS THERE IS EITHER A DESIGN ISSUE OR FLAW OR THE SHOULDER BOLT WAS NOT ASSEMBLED OR TORQUED PROPERLY.  BOLTS DO NOT SIMPLY FALL OUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.  IF THIS WERE NOT AN IMPORTANT BOLT TOYOTA WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE GONE TO THE EXPENSE OF INSTALLING A HARDENED SHOULDER BOLT AS OPPOSED TO A REGULAR BOLT THAT IS MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE. *TR",

I CAN DRIVE FOR A WHILE AND THE LIGHT IS OFF, THEN, OUT OF THE BLUE, IT WILL BEGIN FLASHING AGAIN.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER (FITZGERALD TOYOTA) AND SPENT APPROXIMATELY $100 FOR THE DEALER TO RESEARCH THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM, BUT, THEY COULD NOT BEGIN TO FULLY DIAGNOSE OR RESOLVE THE PROBLEM UNTIL I PAY $873 TO HAVE THE PASSENGER FRONT SEAT REMOVED.  THIS INCLUDES THE PURCHASE OF A NEW SEAT.  THE PASSENGER SEAT IS RARELY USED, SO THE SEAT ITSELF SHOULD NOT BE DEFECTIVE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM COMPONENT IS LOCATED UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT AND THE PROBLEM COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A LOOSE WIRE OR SOMETHING MORE SEVERE.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WAS TOLD THAT IF THE AIRBAG SYMBOL IS ON, THE ENTIRE AIRBAG SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN AND DOES NOT WORK!!!  HOW CAN A SYSTEM SO VITAL TO SAFETY BE PROGRAMMED TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF A LOOSE WIRE?  OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS A DESIGN FLAW.  MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY IS COMPLETELY COMPROMISED.  I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM TAKING MY CHANCES EVERY TIME I STEP INTO MY VEHICLE.  FURTHER, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THAT TOYOTA MIGHT HAVE PAID FOR THE REPAIR IF I HAD UNDER 60,000 MILES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT CAN SAVE LIVES IN A CRASH AND BECAUSE THIS LIGHT FLASHING/SYSTEM SHUT-DOWN IS POSSIBLY AN ELECTRICAL DESIGN FLAW ISSUE, AND DEFINITLEY A SAFETY ISSUE, THIS MATTER SHOULD BE COVERED  UNDER WARRANTY FOR AT LEAST 100,000 MILES.  IF INVESTIGATED, I AM SURE NTSA WILL FIND OTHERS WHO OWN MY SIENNA MODEL YEAR, AS WELL AS OTHER SIENNA YEARS AND OTHER TOYOTA PRODUCTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

THE CAR IS NOT EVEN 4 YEARS OLD AND THE BASIC SAFETY OF THE DOOR OPEN/CLOSE IS ALREADY COMPROMISED! I WAS ALSO TOLD TODAY BY ANOTHER DEALER THAT TOYOTA ISSUED A \"TECHNICAL BULLETIN\" ABOUT THE HINGES/MECHANISM ON 2004 VERSIONS (AND THE 2005 - AT LEAST THROUGH MY PRODUCTION DATE) SINCE THEY HAD  A NUMBER OF (QUESTIONS?) ABOUT THIS ISSUE - AND IT IDENTIFIED SPECIFICALLY HOW TO FIX IT. TO ME IF THIS IS OCCURRING ENOUGH TO HAVE A TECHNICAL BULLETIN, THEN TOYOTA KNOWS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.

FURTHERMORE, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TMPS WAS WORKING PERFECTLY. I FIND APPLICATION OF A TMPS BASED ON TIRE CIRCUMFERENCE WITH RUN-FLAT TIRES IS COMPLETELY USELESS.

I THEN MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT KINGS TOYOTA IN CINCINNATI, OH AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUE, WARRANTY, ETC AND BROUGHT THE CAR IN ABOUT 4 DAYS LATER FOR MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT.

LAST YEAR (FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP) THE HATCH CLOSED ON ME AND WOULD NOT RETRACT. AND, I WAS PUSHING BACK ON THIS THING BY ARCHING MY BACK. I'M NOT SURE HOW I GOT OUT FROM UNDER IT BUT I DID. IT PRETTY MUCH FREAKED ME OUT. IT WAS COLD, AND THERE WAS SNOW ON THE VAN. THERE WAS ALSO AN ICE DAM IN THE GAP AT THE TOP OF THE DOOR. I ORIGINALLY ATTRIBUTED MY INCIDENT TO THIS ICE DAM. (BTW - CHRYSLER'S DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PIECE OF PLASTIC ATTACHED TO THE DOOR THAT PREVENTS ICE FROM GETTING INTO THIS OPENING.)    I CONTINUED TO TEST MY HATCH ON OCCASION FROM THEN ON ALL THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND THE FALL. IT WORKED JUST FINE UNTIL DEC 8, 2006.     DEC 8, 2006, THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO 33 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. IT WAS A CLEAR DAY. THERE WAS NO SNOW.    THE HATCH WOULD NOT RETRACT WHEN I PULLED BACK ON IT. IT CLOSED - EVEN THOUGH I BEGAN APPLYING UPWARD PRESSURE WHILE IT WAS STILL 90% OPEN. IF I HAD BEEN BETWEEN THE CLOSING HATCH AND BUMPER, I COULD HAVE BEEN BADLY HURT. IF MY CHILDREN WERE THERE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.     I AM CONVINCED THAT WHATEVER IS BEING USED AS A SENSOR IN THE DOOR MECHANISM LOSES SENSITIVITY DURING FREEZING TEMPERATURES.     I'M SUGGESTING THAT THE REASON THE FAILURE TO RETRACT CAN'T BE REPLICATED AT THE SERVICE CENTERS IS BECAUSE THE CAR HAS WARMED UP ENOUGH BY THE TIME IT GETS THERE, OR WHEN IT IS WORKED ON IN A HEATED GARAGE, THE SENSOR THEN BEGINS TO WORK CORRECTLY BECAUSE IT IS NOW \"WARM\".     EACH TIME I'VE HAD THE PROBLEM, MY CAR WAS STONE COLD. IT SAT OUT OVERNIGHT DURING FREEZING OR NEAR FREEZING TEMPERATURES WHILE IN MY DRIVE WAY. THE ENGINE HAD NOT BEEN STARTED. I WAS USING MY REAR HATCH TO LOAD/UNLOAD THE VAN ONLY.   NOW THAT THE TEMPERATURE HAS MOVED UP INTO THE 40'S-50'S, THE HATCH APPEARS TO RETRACT CORRECTLY WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS AN OBSTACLE.  *JB",

IT OVERREACTS SUDDENLY AND AT TOO MUCH A RATE, IN AN ANTICIPATED LITTLE SKIDDING THAT HAD BEEN EASILY CORRECTED MANUALLY IN MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER CARS.  I HAVE A 2005 SIENNA LE AWD. IT COMES WITH VSC, ABS, TRAC. I WAS CORNERING A 30 MPH LEFT TURN WITH THE VAN GOING 35 MPH ON HIGHWAY 431 IN NEVADA. IT WAS DOWN HILL, SO I WAS USING LOW GEAR (3) TO APPLY ENGINE BRAKING.  IT WAS NOT SNOWING. THE ROAD WAS DRY WITHOUT SNOW. ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THERE WERE SOME GRAVELS/SALTS. THE VAN VEERED TO THE RIGHT A BIT AS I WAS MAKING A  WIDE TURN. IT WENT OFF THE LANE ABOUT 1 OR 2 FEET ONTO THE SHOULDER, BUT STILL ON PAVEMENT. ON THE SHOULDER, THE FRONT WHEELS SKIDDED BY A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT, WHICH IS ANTICIPATED AND NORMAL IN MY DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HANDLED WITH EASE. HOWEVER, THE VSC KICKED IN SUDDENLY, CAUSING THE VAN TO TURN TO THE LEFT TIGHTLY AND AT A VERY FAST RATE, INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE ON THE UNDIVIDED 2-LANE HIGHWAY. IT ALL HAPPENED IN A BLINK OF EYES. FORTUNATELY,  THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC IN THE OPPOSITE LANE, AND I WAS ALERT ENOUGH TO QUICKLY STEER THE VAN BACK TO MY LANE, AVOIDING HITTING THE MOUNTAIN ON THE LEFT.  THE VSC LIGHT DID COME ON IN FEW OTHER OCCASIONS, BUT THE VAN WAS NEVER OUT OF MY CONTROL IN THOSE CASES.  FROM MY PAST DRIVING EXPERIENCE OF 20 YEARS (MANY OF WHICH WERE WITH SNOW), I REALLY FEEL THIS IS AN OVERCORRECTION BY THE VSC BY A HUGE AMOUNT.  I AM STARTING TO FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT SUCH VSC REACTION CAN'T BE  REDUCED (E.G., TO A SLOWER AND LESSER RATE) OR COMPLETELY TURNED OFF.  IT'S WINTER TIME AGAIN AND I AM GOING TO SKI WITH MY FAMILY. IT REMINDS ME THAT I HAVE NOT FILED THIS COMPLAINT YET AND THAT I WILL HAVE TO BE DRIVING NERVOUSLY,  WHO KNOWS WHEN VSC IS TO KICK IN AGAIN, BY HOW MUCH AMOUNT, OR AT WHAT RATE.  *NM",

THIS SYSTEM WAS AND THERE IS SOMEWHERE AT TOYOTA A SPEC. THEY ARE NOT SHARING WITH CONSUMERS BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATION IT WOULD HAVE (THEY WILL HAVE TO RECALL/FIX THEM). I DO HOPE SOMEONE AT THE NHTSA WILL PURSUE THIS SINCE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR FAMILIES.  *NM",

THE DUNLOP TIRES ARE ALMOST WORN OUT, ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY PUT ON THEM MO MORE THAN 12-13,000 MILES. PART OF THE REASON I BELIEVE IS THAT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR(EVEN WHEN I TEST DROVE IT) I NOTICED  A ROUGH RIDE AND A PULL TO THE LEFT, BUT COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE DEALER TO ORDER ANOTHER CAR, SO I TOOK IT HOME (I BOUGHT IT FROM A DEALER OUT OF TOWN). ALSO I WAS BLAMING THE TIRE THREAD  GEOMETRY FOR THE ROUGH RIDE, AND THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED ME TO CHANGE THE TIRES FOR THE CHEAPER ONES BRIDGESTONE, BUT I HAD TO PAY LIKE $80 FOR THE OPERATION, SO I DECIDED NOT TO. THE ROUGH DRIVE CONTINUED UNTIL I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHO FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS MISALIGNED.  THE DID A FREE ALIGNMENT BUT THE CAR WOULD STILL PULL TO THE LEFT. THIS, I WAS TOLD, WAS NORMAL, SINCE THE TIRES HAD BEEN WORN UNEVENLY, SO NOW THEY HAD TO GET THE NORMAL WEAR AGAIN.  NOW THE CAR NO LONGER PULLS, BUT THIS COMES A THE COST OF HAVING EXCESSIVELY WORN TIRES. I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNIQUE CASE.  *NM",

AT THAT TIME THE MANAGER ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MY ADVISOR HAS MADE BLUNDERS DURING MY PREVIOUS VISITS.

THEY SAID THAT THE OVERHEAD COMPUTER WAS NOT SET CORRECTLY AND IT WAS RESET TO 22.7 MPG. AS I WAS LEAVING THE COMPUTER WAS DROPPING ON THE MPG, I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER ROB.  HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS WRONG AND THAT I NEEDED TO DRIVE IT FOR AT LEAST 5,000 MI. BEFORE I KNEW WHAT THE CAR WOULD GET.  BULL MY 04 ALWAYS GOT 19 TO 20 MPG.  TODAY I MANUALLY TRACKED IT AND ONCE AGAIN MY CAR IS ONLY GETTING 14.33 MPG.  TOYOTA CORP. CALLED ME ABOUT THE VAN. HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM THEM. THEY SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT.

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM: WHEN DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP, THE THROTTLE WILL OCCASIONALLY FAIL TO RESPOND TO THE INITIAL PRESSURE BEING APPLIED TO THE PEDAL. CONTINUING TO DEPRESS, OR APPLYING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TO, THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE THE THROTTLE ON THE ENGINE TO ENGAGE AND THIS RESULTS IN AN UNANTICIPATED SURGE IN ENGINE OUTPUT AND ACCELERATION.

WHEN AN ADULT NOTICED IT AND TRIED TO RETRACT THE BELT MANUALLY, IT WOULD SOMETIMES RETRACT BUT ON OTHER OCCASIONS PULL THE CLIP APART.

THE SERVICE MANAGER INDICATED HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT PROBLEM NOR HAD A SIMILAR COMPLAINT (SOMETHING I NOW FIND VERY HARD TO BELIEVE).  A PROMISE WAS MADE THE THE TOYOTA FIELD REP WOULD CALL IN A FEW DAYS.  RATHER, IN A FEW WEEKS, ONLY AFTER I COMPLAINED TO TOYOTA, I HEARD FROM AMY SCHWARTZ WHO INDICATED SHE RECORDED MY COMPLAINT BUT THAT TOYOTA WOULD NOT BE TAKING ANY FURTHER ACTION WITH REGARD TO THE COMPLAINT.  NOT ONCE DID SHE INDICATE THERE HAD BEEN A CASE OPENED ALREADY.    PLEASE PURSUE THIS AND GET TOYOTA'S ATTENTION BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY.  IT IS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT A SIMPLE FIX, AS I HAVE APPLIED TO MY OWN CLIP, WOULD SUFFICE FROM STRICTLY A SAFETY STANDPOINT, BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT TOYOTA S\\HOULD COME UP WITH A MORE ELAGANT AND PERMANENT SOLUTION.  I SIMPLY GLUED THE CLIP CLOSED AND PUT A 2-INCH WIDE AND 5 INCH LONG STRIP OF SMOOTH PACKAGING TAPE OVER THE FRON OF THE CLIP (COVERING THE DIVISION OR SPLIT POINT), THEREBY REMOVING ANY POINT WHERE THE BELT COULD CATCH.",

NEITHER THE SIDE CURTAIN AIR BAG NOR SIDE SEAT AIR BAG WENT OFF.  I CONTACTED TOYOTA YESTERDAY AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONTACT TO ME WITHIN 3 BUSINESS.  I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM WHETHER THEY SAY (A) IT SHOULD HAVE GONE OFF AND DIDN'T OR (B) THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE OFF WITH THIS TYPE OF CRASH.  VAN HAS NOT YET BEEN REPAIRED.  ONE ISSUE IS WHETHER I SHOULD WAIT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED.   DIGITAL PICTURES OF VAN ARE AVAILABLE.   *NM",
