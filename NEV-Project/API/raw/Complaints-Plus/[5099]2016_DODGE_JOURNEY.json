That was  $2000. that didn't fix all of the problems so it went to the Dealership.  They swore to my daughter & husband that it was the Camshaft sensor failing, wiring harness failing, it had a break in a wire and 1 sensor had a high resistance and another sensor had NO resistance. They quoted us $1750. and that it would fix the problem.  Now after 3 weeks they say that wasn't the problem and that it was going to cost another couple of thousands of dollars.  There was a important safety recall for 2016 Dodge Journeys on the crankshaft sensor &/or camshaft electrical connector terminal, which says it could cause a crash from the engine stalling while driving.  They say it was certain Dodge Journey, Jeep Compass & Jeep Patriot.  Vehicles manufactured May 9, 2016 to July 15, 2016 that was a Manufacturer Recall S89(Also, NHTSA safety recall  # 16V907000 crankshaft or camshaft sensor, causing engine to stall) I've seen other people with the same problem.  Not to mention the dealership is now saying there's a part they need and have no way of getting.  WOW so we owe them almost 2K and they really don't know what the problem is.  My daughter is a single mother of 2 and can't not have a car.  She still makes payments on the Journey the dealership has.  How can a business cover one vehicle for the same issue another is having??? That's total crap!! Either fix it under the recall for free or get her out of the vehicle without going upside down... Why should someone have to argue when you know that this problem exists??? It's hard enough these days & dealerships don't care they just want to blame you for the problem and continue to rack up for fixing something that should be covered, & that you cant get a part that the car needs? That one still stumps me, how can you not get a part for your own product?",

This led to an immediate lose of power with no ability to accelerate. This happened 7 times from Sterling Boulevard to Loudoun County Parkway exit on Rt 7. At one point, I was almost rear-end after loosing power.  This happened to me once before on 7/18/2021 at 11:30p, again I was driving home from work. I called the dealership on 7/22, because I was out of town from 719-7/21, in the morning to see if they could repair the issue. They could not get me in until July 28th. They assured me it was safe to drive. If it happened again, I was instructed to stop and reset the vehicle, which was done every time I lost power on 7/22, but they assured me the vehicle  was safe to drive to a job I had Salisbury, Maryland on Saturday (3 hrs away). I ended up canceling the job.     My concern is that upon researching the internet, there seemed to be too many of the same stories. This issue seems to be affecting Journeys and Chargers based on my research. If I was on an Interstate with a semi behind me, there is no way that driver could have braked in time.",

I was able to start it up and luckily no vehicle was behind me the first time it occurred.  In Raleigh it did this again at a red light but because the vehicle behind me was still at a stop and I was aware from the time before I quickly restarted and drove with little fanfare.  The Journey would drive fine, but when stopping at a sign or light or stopping in general the vehicle will stall.  It buckle and then stalls as well.  I was able to get home from Raleigh to Raeford NC because of driving on the highway.  However, upon arriving in local roads in Raeford and having to stop at the lights, the Journey stalled at every light.  I was able to start it up and drive a few times, and a few other times it would stall on first, or second try then work on next.  It once stalled and took multiple times (more than 3) restarting before I was able to get it driving.  At home I was able to get the vehicle safely into the driveway and upon starting it while in park it would idle normally and not shut off.  I then put it in reverse to back up and it immediately started to buckle and then stalled.  Put in in park and start the engine again and it would idle, went to drive and it stalled again.  Restarted it in park and went to neutral and it would idle, but try to go to drive or reverse and it would start to buckle as if to shut off.  Back in neutral or park and again it idles.  It will role in neutral if I release the brakes too.  Put it in drive or reverse and it stalls and shut off.  Now I am unable to even get it out of my driveway.
