I HAD THE 100,000 MILE SERVICE COMPLETED ON 8/10/18 AND NOTICED I HAD TO ADD ADDITIONAL OIL TO THE ENGINE SINCE THEN, APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 QUARTS. THE WEEKEND OF 11/11/18, I NOTICED THE OIL WAS LOW WHEN I CHECKED THE LEVEL, BUT THE OIL LIGHT NEVER CAME ON TO NOTIFY ME. THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT TOYOTA HAD AN EXCESSIVE OIL EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH EXPIRED LAST YEAR AND ASKED ME IF I WAS NOTIFIED BY TOYOTA. I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. I HAD BEEN NOTIFIED SEVERAL TIMES BY MAIL AND EVEN A PHONE CALL REGARDING THE TAKATA AIR BAG RECALL AND THE TRD BRAKE KIT RECALL BUT NEVER ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE OIL ISSUE UNTIL TOLD BY THE TECHNICIAN. THE TECHNICIAN SUGGESTED I CALL TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MAYBE THEY WOULD OFFER SOME CONSIDERATION SINCE I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY TOYOTA. I CALLED AND SPOKE WITH TWO REPRESENTATIVES, BOTH VERY NICE BUT WOULD NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE WITH THE EXCESSIVE OIL EXTENDED WARRANTY, SINCE I HAD NO ISSUES UNTIL NOW AND THE WARRANTY WAS OVER. I REVIEWED THE TOYOTA WEBSITE AT HTTPS://WWW.TOYOHEADQUARTERS.COM AND FOUND A LETTER THAT HAD ALLEGEDLY BEEN SENT OUT TO ALL OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITH EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUES. I NEVER RECEIVED THIS LETTER. I ALSO FOUND THE TOYOTA EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT DATING BACK TO 2011 AND THEY HAD ISSUED A TSB WHICH AGAIN I NEVER HEARD ABOUT UNTIL NOW. I HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN TAKING MY SCION TO TOYOTA FOR REGULAR SERVICES AND NEVER WAS IT REPORTED TO ME.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND 3/4 IN 1300 MILES IS (A LOT) MEANS I HAVE TO ADD 4QTS OF OIL IN BETWEEN OIL CHANGES IF INTERVALS ARE 5000 MILES. THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!! I AM BASICALLY DOING A OIL CHANGE MY SELF BY BURNING & ADDING BECAUSE 4QTS IS THE CAPACITY OF THIS CAR. TOYOTA SET THE STANDARD OF THIS TEST BEYOND REASONABLE ON PURPOSE. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WILL QUALIFY FOR ANY REPAIRS TO THE PISTON RINGS OR BLOCK WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT NEGLECTED THEIR ENGINES BY NOT ADDING OIL IN BETWEEN OIL CHANGES AND DAMAGING THE ENGINE MORE THAN THE GOOD GUY CONSTANTLY ADDING TO SAVE OUR CAR!!! TOYOTA IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY FOR REASONS LIKE THIS. I WILL STICK WITH HONDA IN THE FUTURE. HONDA DOES NOT PLAY THESE STUPID GAMES WITH PEOPLE. MY SCION HAS BEEN CONSUMING EXCESSIVE OIL SINCE IT WAS BRAND NEW AND TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT ISSUE SINCE THEY ISSUED A TSB ON IT AND FREE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST.

I HAD AN OIL CHANGE AND TOOK A ROAD TRIP SO THAT I PUT MORE THAN A 1000 MILES ON IT IN ABOUT 10 DAYS, AND WHEN I WAS ON A STEEP INCLINE THE CHECK OIL LIGHT CAME ON.  MY MECHANIC SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE OIL HAD NOT BEEN FILLED PROPERLY AFTER THE CHANGE AND TOPPED IT OFF.

AFTER ANOTHER 1,500 OR SO MILES IT NEEDED ANOTHER TWO QUARTS OF OIL, WHICH I ADDED.  I CONTACTED TOYOTA, AND WITHOUT RECITING THE INITIAL RUNAROUND, THEY SET UP AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AFTER CONFIRMING IT WAS NOT LEAKING OIL.  THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST IS NOT COMPLETED - IT MAY NOT BE A TRUE REFLECTION OF OIL USAGE AS IT SEEMS TO BE WORSE WHEN DRIVEN A LONG DISTANCE AT ONE TIME WHICH WILL PROBABLY NOT HAPPEN DURING THIS 1,000 MILE CYCLE.

HE WAS DRIVING ON THE 1ST LANE, AND TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE COMPACT CAR PASSING NEARBY, WHEN THE CAR STOPPED ALL OF A SUDDEN . HE TRIED TO REACH OUT  FOR A TOW TRUCK WITHOUT SUCCESS, BUT LATER ON HE REMEMBERED  HE WAS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER OF  A CLASSIC MEMBERSHIP CARD REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER. BUT HE DID NOT HAVE THE CARD ON HIM AT THAT TIME, BUT GAVE HIS NAME TO AAA TO PROVE HE IS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER. FINALLY, THE AAA TOW TRUCK ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AROUND 1:45 A.M. HE TOWED IT TO HOME, AND DAYS LATER HAD IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC SHOP, EAST BAY AUTO LOCATED ON NORTH TEXAS STREET. THE MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AND SAID THE ENGINE GOT BROKEN AND THE CAR NEEDED REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE.    2.

IF ANY OF THEM DID USE OIL, IT WAS A SMALL ENOUGH AMOUNT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL FROM THE DIPSTICK.  SO, WITH THEIR EXPLANATION I MOVED ON. AS TIME WENT ON, IT SEEMED MORE AND MORE OIL WAS BEING USED BY THE ENGINE. NOW AFTER THE WARRANTY WOULD NO LONGER COVER SUCH A THING, I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD BRING THE VEHICLE IN FOR AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST, WHICH I DID NOT DO SINCE ANY PROBLEM THEY DISCOVER WOULD COME OUT OF MY POCKET.  AS TIME PROGRESSES, THE VEHICLE IS AT THE POINT WHERE I HAVE TO CHECK THE OIL EVERY WEEK AND ADD OIL. I LEARNED THAT IF I WAIT FOR THE NEXT OIL CHANGE @ 3000 MILES, THERE IS NO OIL LEFT IN THE ENGINE. WHAT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS THAT THERE IS NO INDICATION ON THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER THAT ANYTHING IS WRONG. I WOULD SUSPECT THE OIL LIGHT WOULD COME ON AT SOME POINT, BUT NEVER HAVE I SEEN THIS LIGHT, OR ANY OTHER LIGHT COME ON INDICATING AN ISSUE.   TO SUM IT UP, THERE ARE NO LEAKS, THE ENGINE WILL CONSUME ALL OF THE OIL WITHIN 3000 MILES IF NOT MONITORED, AND THERE ARE NO WARNING LIGHTS INDICATING A PROBLEM.  *TR",

WELL, THE NEXT DAY IT STARTED TO OCCUR AGAIN AND THIS TIME,  THE VIBRATION WAS MUCH HEAVIER.  SO, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME PERSON THAT I'VE HAVE DEALT WITH ON THIS ISSUE.  I HAD EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT FIXED. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT \"I STILL FEEL THE VIBRATION ON MY VEHICLE YOU NEED TO TEST DRIVE IT YOURSELF SO YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN\". WELL THE GUY DID TEST DRIVE IT AND OF COURSE HE DID DESCRIBE IT THAT IT IS AN UNUSUAL NOISE THAT THE SCION XB  IS DOING. HE ALSO INDICATED TO ME THAT IT IS TOO SOON FOR THIS VEHICLE TO BE HAVING A TRANSMISSION ISSUE. SO THEY WILL HAVE THEIR TOYOTA TECHNICIANS GUYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND THE 3 WEEKS ARE ALMOST HERE AND MY CAR IT IS STILL SITTING IN THEIR SHOP TO BE FIXED. NOW, THE BIG QUESTION IS \" WILL THIS CAR BE SAFE FOR ME TO DRIVE WITH MY FAMILY ON THE HIGHWAY? YES, THEY ARE CHANGING THE TRANSMISSIONS BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THIS TRANSMISSION BREAKS DOWN ON ME 1 YEAR FROM NOW OR EVEN MONTHS FROM NOW.  I WILL REALLY BE WORRIED ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM WITH MY CHILDREN. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS OR ANY TIPS THAT I NEED TO DO?  I FEEL VERY UNSAFE NOW THAT THIS VEHICLE IT IS NOT GOING TO BE SAFE.  *TR  UPDATED 07/06/10. *LJ  UPDATED 07/09/10.*JB",

AFTER THE SHOCK EVERY SPEAKERS STARTED EMITTING STATIC AND I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TURNED THE WHOLE RADIO OFF.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN AND WAS SENT OUT THE DOOR WITH NO RESOLUTION B/C THE SERVICE CENTER COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  2 MONTHS WENT BY AND THE SHOCKING AND STATIC HAPPENED AGAIN.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN WHILE THE ISSUE WAS PRESENT AND THEY TRIED TO SENT ME HOME UNTIL I BEGGED AN ASSOCIATE TO PLEASE SIT IN THE CAR AND EXPERIENCE WHAT MY FAMILY AND I HAD.

        "summary": "LOW BEAM HEADLAMPS ON THE 2008 SCION XB DO NOT PROJECT OUT FAR ENOUGH FROM THE VEHICLE.  THERE IS A CLEARLY DEFINED LINE ABOUT 75 FEET FROM THE VEHICLE WHERE THE LIGHT ENDS AND THE DARK BEGINS DURING NIGHT DRIVING.  THE SOLUTION ACCORDING TO TOYOTA/SCION WAS TO PURCHASE FOG LAMPS AS AUXILIARY LIGHTING THEY DO HELP AS DO THE HIGH BEAMS.  HOWEVER THE SO CALLED \"HALOGEN HEADLIGHTS W/ PROJECTOR LOW BEAMS' DO NOT DO EXACTLY THAT PROJECT ENOUGH LIGHT.  I CAN NOT GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW DANGEROUS THE SITUATION IS WHEN YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LOW BEAMS.  THEY CLAIM THE LIGHTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO THE MAXIMUM.  AND ARE DESIGNED AS URBAN LIGHTS SO AS TO NOT BE INTRUSIVE TO OPPOSING DRIVERS OR PEDESTRIANS.  I HOWEVER LIVE IN A VERY RURAL AREA AND THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR RURAL DRIVING.  THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE CAUSED BY BOTH BEAMS POINTING DOWN AND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT TOYOTA/SCION NEEDS TO RESOLVE, OR BE FORCED TO RESOLVE.  I SUSPECT AS THE DAYS GET SHORTER MORE OWNERS LIKE ME WILL DISCOVER HOW POORLY THE LOW BEAMS PERFORM.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CRASHES, INJURIES OR DEATHS UNLESS YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T.  *TR",
