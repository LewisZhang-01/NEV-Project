SO I WENT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A RECALL BUT A CLASS ACTION SUIT. MEANING THEY WOULD REPAIR IT BUT I HAD TO COME UP WITH A VEHICLE FOR 2 WEEKS WHILE THEY REPAIRED IT. I CAN'T AFFORD THE RENTAL, SO THEY LET ME DRIVE OFF WITH MY VEHICLE IN VERY VERY POOR CONDITION.

SO HERE I'M COMPLAINING TO YOU, WERE I HOPE GOD SOMEHOW TOUCHES YOU ENOUGH TO MAKE A FEW 100,000 PEOPLE MUCH SAFER BY MAKING THIS A RECALL. FOR IT SURLY IS UNSAFE AS SAID BY MANY MECHANICS (EVEN THE DEALER SHIPS MECHANIC SAID IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE IT). BUT BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD A RENTAL WITH A NEW BABY, AND MANY BILLS... I'M STILL DRIVING THIS 2000 BMW 323I AND I WILL UNTIL I CAN EITHER AFFORD THE TWO WEEK RENTAL OR SOMEONE HELPS MY SITUATION. ALL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, AND WOULD BE REPLACED BY THE DEALER AT THEIR EXPENSE (IN OTHER WORDS. A BIG COVER-UP). BUT BECAUSE IT ISN'T A RECALL,  THEY LET ME DRIVE AWAY BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME A RENTAL IN REPLACE OF THE FAILED BMW.... I HAVE THE INSPECTION COPY FROM DEALER STATING BELOW;  CAMPAIGN  SUBFRAME RECALL IS DUE  DAMAGE FOUND UNDERNEATH REAR CARRIER, REQUIRES BODYSHOP ATTENTION.    IF THEY ARE CALLING IT A RECALL THEN WHY ISN'T IT ON THE RECALL LIST? AND IF IT WENT TO A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AND LOST...

THE ADVISOR TOLD ME BASED ON THE REVERSE FAILING IT WOULD LIKELY BE A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT NEEDED. WHEN ASKED HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST HE SAID ANOTHER CUSTOMER WITH MY EXACT SAME YEAR/MAKE/MODEL IN THE WEEK PRIOR PAID $8K FOR HIS.  WE THEN CAME HOME AND DID RESEARCH WHICH HAS REVEALED THOUSANDS OF OTHER OWNERS WITH THE SAME YEAR/MAKE/MODEL HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND APPARENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING BMW HAS KNOWN ABOUT BUT IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT AT ALL.  I EMAILED THE GM OF MY DEALERSHIP THE SAME SAT EVENING I DROPPED THE CAR OFF AND ATTACHED MANY ARTICLES AND WEBSITES HIGHLIGHTING THE ISSUE AND TELLING THEM I PLANNED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MY OWN COMPLAINTS WITH BMW NA AND ONLINE FORUMS AND LOCAL NEWS OUTLETS.  TODAY (MONDAY) I INITIALLY GOT A CALL FROM AN ADVISOR TELLING ME THE CAR DOES IN FACT NEED A NEW TRANNY AND THAT IT WOULD BE $6500.  LATER IN THE AFTERNOON THE HEAD OF THE SERVICE DEPT. CALLED SAYING THE GM HAD FORWARDED MY EMAIL AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER TO REDUCE THE COST TO $4K FOR ME. I TOLD HIM I HAD TO TALK TO MY FIANCE AND CALLED HIM BACK TELLING HIM THEY'D HAVE TO OFFER MORE THAN THAT TO GET ME TO NOT MOVE FORWARD SHARING MY ISSUES.  I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK YET (IT IS NOW MONDAY EVENING) BUT I IMAGINE SOMEONE WILL CALL ME TOMORROW.  REGARDLESS OF HOW MY LOCAL DEALER CHOOSES TO DEAL WITH ME I DO FEEL THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THAT 2 SERVICE ADVISORS AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND CLEARLY THE GM DOES TOO OR SHE NEVER WOULD'VE FORWARDED MY EMAILS ON.

MANY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS A GM TRANSMISSION AND THAT GM ISSUED A RECALL ON ITS VEHICLES OWN VEHICLES HOWEVER BMW HAD NOT AND WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM, BUT INTERESTINGLY THEY ARE NO LONGER USING THESE TRANSMISSIONS.

THE DOWNWARD SLANT OF THE WINDOW ALSO HINDERS AN OPTIMAL DRIVING VIEW.  THIS IS A NEW DESIGN FOR 2000, AND THE PREVIOUS BMW CONVERTIBLES DID NOT HAVE THIS SLANT ISSUE OR THE PLACEMENT OF BLUNT CORNERS NEAR THE HEADS OF THE PASSENGERS.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE ON THIS DEFECT.  BMW WILL BEGIN RELEASING THESE MODELS TO THE PUBLIC IN THE MAY TIMEFRAME.  DEMOS ARE NOW AVAILABLE AT THE DEALERSHIPS.  I LOVE BMW AUTOMOBILES, AND I ORDERED THIS PARTICULAR CONVERTIBLE.  I'M WRITING WITH THE HOPES THAT YOUR OFFICE WILL LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE ASAP AND HELP/ADVISE BMW TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IF A TRUE PROBLEM EXISTS BEFORE THEY RELEASE THESE VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES IN MASS.
