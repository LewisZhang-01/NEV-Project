(IDEALLY WHEN YOU FIRST TOUCH THE BRAKES, THE CAR SHOULD COME OUT OF CRUISE) ONCE THE CAR REACHED AT A SPEED OF 80 MILES AND I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING. WHEN THE CAR WAS SHUT DOWN ABNORMALLY, AND RESTARTED THE ISSUE CONTINUED AND EVEN WHEN IT WAS IN NEUTRAL, IT CONSTANTLY RAVED UP. I SEE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE RECENTLY FILED COMPLAINS FOR THIS AND EXPECT THE NHTSA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT URGENTLY AS IN MY OPINION IT IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. THE MECHANIC MENTIONED THAT  THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE WAS STUCK IN THE HOUSING. CURRENTLY THE CRUISE CONTROL HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED BY MY MECHANIC AND I HAVE BOUGHT A NEW CRUISE CONTROL CABLE FROM THE DEALER AND HOPE TO GET IT FIXED SOON, HOWEVER EXPECT THE COMPANY TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH OF THE ABOVE ISSUES.",

I RESTARTED THE ENGINE A COUPLE TIMES, BUT IT STALLED OUT AGAIN AFTER A FEW SECONDS.  IT WAS POTENTIALLY A DANGEROUS SITUATION, BUT LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ROLL THE CAR BACK DOWNHILL TO A SAFER LOCATION.  (LATER I LEARNED THAT AN IDENTICAL SCENARIO IS DESCRIBED IN FORD DEALER LETTER 03N01, IN WHICH FORD AGREES TO REPLACE FUEL DELIVERY MODULES FOR 2000 AND 2001 MODELS, BUT NOT 2002.)  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A FORD DEALER, BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO LOOK AT IT TILL THE NEXT MORNING, AT WHICH TIME THE CAR STARTED FINE.  FORD RAN MANY TESTS, INCLUDING ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL, TOOK IT OUT FOR 3 ' 4 TEST DRIVES AND COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  THEY CHARGED $150 FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC LABOR.  THIS CAR HAS DONE THIS EVERY YEAR NOW FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.  SIMILAR, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, STALLS OCCURRED ON MARCH 16, 2009, MARCH 10, 2010 AND MARCH 17, 2010.  EACH TIME, I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED.  LOCATIONS WERE DIFFERENT, SO IT WAS ALWAYS A DIFFERENT SHOP.  NONE OF THEM WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT RIGHT AWAY, AND BY THE TIME THEY LOOKED AT IT THE NEXT DAY, THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, EACH ONE CHARGED ABOUT $150 LABOR.  THOSE 3 INCIDENTS ALSO REQUIRED A NEW 15 AMP FUSE FOR THE FUEL PUMP, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE REPEATED UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO RESTART THE CAR AFTER IT STALLED.  THIS YEAR, I STOPPED TRYING TO RESTART AFTER 4 UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS.  THE FUSE DID NOT BLOW THIS YEAR.  IN BETWEEN THESE STALLOUTS, USUALLY EXACTLY ONE YEAR APART, THE ENGINE HAS STARTED AND RUN SMOOTHLY, WITH NO INDICATION OF PROBLEMS.  EACH TIME A STALL HAS HAPPENED, THE CAR HAS WORKED FINE THE NEXT DAY, WITHOUT ANY ADDITION OF FUEL.  THIS INDICATES THAT IT IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF FUEL IN THE TANK.  THE ONLY EXPLANATION THAT I CAN SEE FOR THESE UNPREDICTABLE FAILURES IS A DEFECT IN THE FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM.  *TR",

I MOVED THE CAR FORWARD TO A SLIGHTLY BETTER SPOT, BUT COULD NOT MANEUVER IT INTO A TRUE PARKING SPOT. I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK SINCE THE CAR WOULD SURELY BE TOWED AT THE START OF BUSINESS HOURS THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK OPERATOR ARRIVED HE TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE IN FORDS, AND SAID THAT I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, OTHERWISE HE WOULD LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO TOW IT (IT WAS A FLATBED TOW TRUCK). I HAD HIM TOW THE CAR TO A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP. THAT NIGHT I LOOKED UP INFORMATION ONLINE AND FOUND THAT MANY FORDS 2000-2003 HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM - SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAID THE KEY WOULD GET STUCK IN THE IGNITION. THE NEXT DAY THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THE KEY CYLINDER ISSUE, BUT THAT THEY WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM FOR $501.56. I SAW NO ALTERNATIVE AND HAD THEM PUT IN A NEW IGNITION CYLINDER AND ISSUE 2 NEW KEYS. THE DEALER KEPT THE OLD PARTS (OLD IGNITION CYLINDER AND KEYS).

THE NEW IGNITION WE BOUGHT WAS SUPPOSEDLY FREE OF THE DEFECT THAT WAS CAUSING THE IGNITION FAILURE.  WE HAVE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND THE AMOUNT OF FOCUS OWNERS AFFECTED BY THIS IS WIDESPREAD.  THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS LEFT STRANDED ON ONE OF THE COLDEST DAYS OF WINTER WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD SON.  FORD WILL NOT COVER THESE REPAIRS BECAUSE MY CAR IS OBVIOUSLY OUT OF THE STANDARD WARRANTY PERIOD, HOWEVER, I'M LEFT TO PAY FOR THE SAME COSTLY REPAIR TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  MEANWHILE, REMAINING CONSTANTLY WORRIED ALL THE TIME IF MY CAR WILL LEAVE ME STRANDED.  PLEASE HELP US FORD FOCUS OWNERS AND PUSH FORD TO RECALL THIS APPARENT AND IMMEDIATE SAFETY DEFECT!!! *TR",

INSPECTION REVEALED THAT BOTH MOUNTING STUDS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE ENGINE MOUNT FOR THE TRANSVERSELY MOUNTED ENGINE HAD BROKEN OFF ALLOWING THE ENGINE TO DROP DOWN ONTO THE PASSENGER SIDE DRIVE AXLE. THE CAR WAS FLATBED TOWED 5 MILES TO MY MECHANIC. HIS INSPECTION SHOWED THAT ONE OF THE STUDS HAD BEEN BROKEN FOR SOME TIME, WHILE THE SECOND SHOWED A FRESH BREAK. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CORROSION, OR THAT THE STUDS HAD EVER BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED. I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THIS FAILURE OCCURS, BUT THE TOW OPERATOR AND BOTH MECHANICS AT THE SHOP HAD NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT THE CAR BECOMES INOPERABLE WITHOUT CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE. THE RESULT AT HIGHWAY SPEED COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.

I'VE BEEN PUTTING AIR IN IT WHICH HAS COST ME A SURMOUNTABLE AMT OF MONEY RANGING FROM 25 CENTS TO WHATEVER THE MARKET CHARGED COST OF PUTTING AIR IN IT TO THE CURRENT DATE.  IT RUINED A GOOD TIRE AFTER 12,000 MILES OF USE; IT WAS ROTATED ALL THE NECESSARY TIMES; ONLY THE RIGHT PASSENGER FRONT SIDE TIRE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES IT WAS ROTATED; THE SAME SIDE IS FAULTY; AUGUST 2008, A SERVICE CENTER DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM. I TOLD THEM TO EXAMINE THAT PARTICULAR WHEEL AND SEE IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT PROBLEM EXISTS.  THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE WHEEL IS BENT IN 4 DIFFERENT PLACES. I'VE HAD TO BE TOWED FROM MY WORKPLACE; MY AUTO CLUB HAS HAD TO SEND A SERVICE SHOPOUT TO CHANGE THE TIRE OR PUMP IT UP. SOMETIMES THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN MY DRIVEWAY. AFTER WARRANTY IT BECOMES THE OWNER'S PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THE MFR AND DEALER WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. AN OWNER OF A 2004, NEW AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, ALSO HAS A CRACKED WHEEL. UNLESS THIS PROBLEM IS CORRECTED, IT WILL CONTINUE TO COST PURCHASERS MORE MONIES AND ACCIDENTS IF DRIVEN OVER 30-40 MILES PER HR.  THIS IS A MFR'S DEFECT.  A VEHICLE IN THIS CONDITION SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN ON LONG TRIPS AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, SUCH AS ON THE EXPRESSWAYS AND INTERSTATES.  IT IS DANGEROUS REGARDLESS OF SPEED.  ONCE AIR IS PUT BACK INTO THE TIRE, WITHIN A DAY'S TIME, DRIVEN OR NOT DRIVEN, IT STARTS GOING DOWN. BASICALLY, JUST BEING PARKED, IT WILL GO DOWN ANYWAY. WITH THE ETHICS OF THE DEALERSHIP IN THIS AREA, THEY PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING AS I'VE BEEN DOING., ADDING AIR TO THE TIRE AND RETURNING IT BACK TO ME.  THANK YOU.   *TR",

THE CAR HAD A TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAK AND SO I CONTINUED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS AT THE RIGHT LEVELS.   2. THE DAY WHEN THE ENGINE DIED IT HAD BEEN RUNNING NORMALLY. I HAD STOPPED AT THE STORE. WHEN I GOT BACK IN MY CAR AND TURNED IT ON THE ENGINE MADE A POPPING NOISE AND THEN THE ENGINE \"TURNED OVER\" AND STARTED MAKING A THWAPING NOISE, LIKE CARDBOARD IN CONTACT WITH A FAN BLADE. AFTER TOWING IT TO A MECHANIC (IT WOULDN'T START, IT KEPT MAKING THUD-ISH THWAPING NOISES), WHO HAD WORKED FOR FORD PREVIOUSLY, HE SAID THAT THE 4TH PISTON HAD BROKE AND WAS GRINDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE BLOCK (HE HAD TAKEN A LOOK AT THE TIMING BELT - OK- AND WAS TESTING THE GEARS THAT THE TIMING BELT ATTACHED TO. 3 TURNED WITH THE RIGHT TORQUE BUT THE FINAL ONE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE BLOCK DIDN'T TURN UNLESS TORQUE GREATER THAN WHAT WAS NORMALLY NEEDED WAS APPLIED. WHEN IT TURNED THERE WAS A THWAP SOUND INSIDE THE ENGINE). WHAT MADE ME WONDER IS HE SAID THAT THIS ALWAYS HAPPENED WITH THIS MODEL ON THE SINGLE OVERHEAD CAM ENGINES AT AROUND 90 TO 120 THOUSAND MILES. HE SAID THAT HE REPAIRED NUMEROUS SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH THIS TYPE OF ENGINE, EVEN GUARANTEEING THAT OPENING UP THE ENGINE WOULD SHOW THAT THE 4TH PISTON (FARTHEST ON THE RIGHT FACING THE FRONT) BROKE. I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD GOTTEN ON THE FREEWAY AND THE PISTON HAD BROKE.  3. THE COST TO REPLACE WITH A NEW OEM ENGINE WAS MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE CAR IF I WERE TO PERSONALLY SELL IT (BASED ON KELLY BLUE BOOK) AND SO WAS THE COST FOR A USED ENGINE ($1200 WAS THE LOWEST, COMPARED TO THE DUEL OVERHEAD CAM ENGINES FOR THE FOCUS WHICH I FOUND USED FOR $500. SEEMS THE DEMAND FOR THAT STYLE ENGINE IS HIGH). I HAVE NOT REPAIRED IT. I AM CONSIDERING SELLING IT TO A SCRAP YARD.  *TR",

IT SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED THE ALTERNATOR WHICH HAD TO BE REPLACED.  IT ALSO SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED THE THERMOSTAT AND THE SOLENOID SWITCH WHICH CAUSED OVERHEATING AND DYING PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR WHILE DRIVING.

AS SHE APPROACHED I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND EXITED THE VEHICLE SO SHE COULD DRIVE.  UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE LOVED OUR FOCUS BECAUSE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN RELIABLE.  WHEN SHE STARTED UP THE ENGINE, IT STARTED TO SHAKE.  THE SHAKING BECAME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND THEN THE ENGINE STARTED TO SPUTTER.  SHE TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND WAITED A MINUTE AND THEN RESTARTED.  THE SHAKING CONTINUED AT A LESSER  INTENSITY SO SHE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  ABOUT 25 FEET LATER, IN THE MIDDLE OF BUSY OFFICE BUILDING ACCESS  ROAD, THE ENGINE STALLED.  SHE TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE TO NO AVAIL.  IT SOUNDED LIKE THE ENGINE WAS NOT GETTING ANY FUEL.  WE HAD A 1/4 OF A TANK.  WE CHECK THE FUEL PUMP FUSE AND TRIED THE FUEL PUMP RESET SWITCH.  THINKING THAT THE FUEL TANK INDICATOR MIGHT BE DEFECTIVE AND THAT THE CAR MIGHT BE OUT OF FUEL, MY WIFE HAD A CO-WORKER DRIVER HER TO A LOCAL GAS STATION TO GET GAS.  ADDING GAS DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THE FUEL TANK INDICATOR SHOWED THE ADDED FUEL.   WHEN NONE OF THE QUICK FIXES  WORKED, WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO APPLE VALLEY FORD IN APPLE VALLEY MINNESOTA FOR SERVICING.  THEY IDENTIFIED THE FUEL PUMP AS THE CAUSE AND BECAUSE IT IS NOT COVERED BY THE 2000/2001 FOCUS \"EXTENDED WARRANTY\" FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, WE WILL HAVE TO PAY AROUND $600 TO REPAIR THE CAR.      I AM FURIOUS ABOUT THE COST BUT MORE SO ABOUT THE DANGEROUS AND UNTENABLE SITUATION THIS DEFECT PUTS MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY LOVED ONES.  HOW COULD THE 2002 NOT BE INCLUDED?   AFTER RESEARCH INTO THIS ISSUE, I AM ANGRY THAT OUR LIVES ARE NOT CONSIDER IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO FORD OR TO THE NHTSA.

THE KEY ROUTINELY BALKS AND JAMS.  IT FAILED TO TURN OVER 1 WEEK AFTER THE PURCHASE. THE FORD 800 ASSISTANCE # RECOMMENDED PULLING THE STEERING WHEEL BACK & FORTH WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO TURN THE KEY OVER.  THAT WORKED, THEY DID NOT OFFER TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I GOT THE SELLING DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE IGNITION CYLINDER TUMBLER AT 19,000 MI UNDER WARRANTY. BALKING/JAMMING CONTINUED, AT 38,000 THE KEY WOULD NOT TURN OVER AT ALL.  AFTER TOWING IT TO A PRIVATE AUTO REPAIR SHOP, THEY REPLACED THE TUMBLER AGAIN.  1 MONTH LATER IT NEARLY DIDN'T START AGAIN. FORD IN GREENSBURG, IN REPLACED THE TUMBLER AGAIN UNDER A \"GOOD WILL\" POLICY. 9/10/04 THE CAR STRANDED ME AGAIN DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM. AFTER TOWING TO AN INDIANAPOLIS, IN FORD DEALERSHIP, THEY REPLACED THE TUMBLER AGAIN.  THAT'S THE FIFTH TUMBLER IN THAT CAR IN 43,000.  I DON'T THINK THE 5TH ONE WILL FIX IT ANY MORE THAN THE FIRST 4 TUMBLERS DID.  *JB",

THERE WERE SERIOUS COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS WHICH WERE LATER RESOLVED, BUT I WOUND UP PAYING MEINEKE FOR PADS ($133.00 INCL LABOR) FOR A LIFETIME GUARANTEE INSTEAD OF FAIRWAY FORD'S PRICE - $145 FOR 12,000 MILE PADS (SAME BRAND INSTALLED BY THE FACTORY) OR $195 FOR FORD PRODUCT.
