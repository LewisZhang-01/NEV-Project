The contact also stated that unknown black soot had developed on the contact's clothes and the appliances inside the trailer. The RV was taken back to the dealer where they could not find the cause of the soot. The RV was then taken to the manufacturer for further testing and after several additional months of testing, the manufacturer sent an email that informed the contact that mold was discovered inside the RV. The manufacturer had been called several times about the matter but the contact had yet to receive an update. The vehicle had yet to be repaired and remained in the possession of the manufacturer. The failure mileage was 0. The VIN was not available.",
