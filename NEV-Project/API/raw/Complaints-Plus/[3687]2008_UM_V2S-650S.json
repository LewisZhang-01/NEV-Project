SOME OTHER MEMBERS INSPECTED THEIR BEARINGS AND FOUND THEY HAD NOT BEEN LUBRICATED BY EITHER THE FACTORY OR THE DEALER.    THE RESULT OF A STEERING BEARING FAILURE IS AN INABILITY TO STEER.    PHOTO OF THE BEARING HERE...  HTTP://SCOOTDAWG.PROBOARDS59.COM/INDEX.CGI?BOARD=TALK&ACTION=DISPLAY&THREAD=17252    SAFETY IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL WITH ON OUR FORUM. #1 CAUSE OF DEATH OF A 2 WHEELER WILL BE FAILING TO 'MAKE THE TURN'...CAN'T MAKE THE TURN IF THE STEERING FREEZES UP. FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTED INJURIES.    IT'S A PRETTY SMALL FORUM AND TWO HAVING BEARING FAILURES ON THE SAME DAY TO ME IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.    I'VE INSPECTED THE BEARINGS ON MY SCOOTER AND FOUND THEM TO BE PROPERLY LUBRICATED SO I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ANY STANDING TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.    I JUST THOUGHT SOMEONE SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE A SAFETY ALERT IF NECESSARY. THE VALVE STEM SAFETY ALERT IS POSTED ON THE FORUM.    YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHINESE SCOOTER MANUFACTURER IN YOUR MAKE DATABASE SO I JUST PICKED ON AT RANDOM. *TR",
