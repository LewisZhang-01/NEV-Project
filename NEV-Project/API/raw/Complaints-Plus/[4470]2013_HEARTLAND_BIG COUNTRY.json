A PASSING MOTORIST SIGNALED TO US THAT THE LEFT FRONT TIRE OF THE RV WAS FLAT.   WE LEFT THE HIGHWAY AND FOUND A TRUCK AND TRAILER REPAIR FACILITY AT THE EXIT. CAUSE OF THE FLAT WAS THAT THE PLIES OF THE TIRE HAD COME APART AND THE OTHER THREE TIRES WERE SO CLOSE TO FAILING (THE PLIES WERE COMING APART)  THAT WE HAD TO REPLACE ALL FOUR OF THEM.  THEY WERE FACTORY INSTALLED POWER KING TOWMAX  235 80R 16 E.   WE CONTACTED THE DEALER, THE MANUFACTURER, THE DISTRIBUTOR AND TBC TIRE COMPANY IN PALM BEACH GARDENS FLORIDA. ALL THE HEARTLAND CUSTOMER SERVICE REP SAID WAS \"UH HUH\" WHEN I EXPLAINED.  HE DIDN'T CARE.  NONE OF THEM WOULD ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECTIVE TIRES.   TBC SAID THEY ARE GOING TO SEND US A  SMALL CHECK \"AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL.\"    I AM NOT WRITING TODAY TO ASK FOR HELP IN COLLECTING MONEY.   I AM WRITING BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.    THESE TIRES HAD ONLY 6066 MILES ON THEM.    THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE TIRES.   THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS CATASTROPHE HAD ONE OR MORE OF THE REMAINING TIRES ALSO GONE FLAT.   TRAFFIC ON INTERSTATE 75 AT KNOXVILLE WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY AT THE TIME.   IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.       FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, I DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON HEARTLAND RV FORUMS AND HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINS SIMILAR TO OUR ABOUT THESE TIRES FAILING, SOME AS SOON AS 2,000 MILES.    THE REPRESENTATIVE AT TBC TIRES SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THESE ARE NOT THE CORRECT TIRES FOR AN RV THE SIZE OF A HEARTLAND BIG COUNTRY.  I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE WERE A HAIRS BREADTH FROM BEING SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED..   I HAVE ONE OF THE FAILED TIRES.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A WHOLE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY HERE.  *TR",
