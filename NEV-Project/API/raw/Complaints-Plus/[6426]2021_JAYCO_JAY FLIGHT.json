        "summary": "We have experienced an axle failure on our 2021 Jayco Travel Trailer. The trailer has never been over GVW. After a month of discussion with Lippert/Jayco they are unwilling to correct the following issue. Lippert's axle sticker (photo attached) states the Static Load Radius as measured is 11.9\" & not to exceed this rating by more than 10%. The Baja Edition option as built by Jayco comes with 16\" wheels & off road Goodyear tires. My Measurement of the SLR is 14.6\" which exceeds the warning on the Lippert axle sticker. This is what I believe contributed to my axle failure. Our safety was put at great risk with this failure.",
