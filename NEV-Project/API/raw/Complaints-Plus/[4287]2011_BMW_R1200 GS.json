MANY CUSTOMER CLAIMS THAT OUT OF WARRANTY THE GEAR FAULT CAUSING SERIOUS NOISE AND IN SOME CASE CRASH AND INJURIES. THE PROBLEM CONSIST IN A FAULT OF THE OF THE SHAFT IN THE GEARBOX THAT CAN CAUSE THE REAR WHEEL LOCKING. IN FACT, THIS MOTORCYCLE HAD A RIGID TRANSMISSION MADE WITH A SHAFT. WHEN THE SHAFT OF THE GEARBOX CRACK, SOME SMALL METAL PARTS CAN SIMPLY LOCK THE TRANSMISSION. BMW WELL KNOW THE PROBLEM DUE TO SEVERAL MAINTENANCE JOB. I'M WRITING FROM ITALY. I KNOW THAT PROBABLY YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING FOR ME, BUT IN ANY CASE, I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUE IN US. THIS IS THE REASON WHY I WANT TO REVEAL THIS BIG UNSOLVED PROBLEM WITH BMW.",
