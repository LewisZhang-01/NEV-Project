Then the engine stalled, I heard a loud bang, and then once I pulled over immediately, there was oil leaking out of the car.   I was 40+ miles from home, and the nearest Hyundai dealer, and had to get towed back to the dealership. They suspected a known issue with the engine rods and once they inspected it a few days later they confirmed there was a hole in the block. It is a known issue that Hyundai has given a warranty extension on and they replaced the engine and intake manifold, per the service invoice.   I believe a known potential engine failure such as this should be cause for a recall. I was going 75mph when this happened. I could have lost control of the vehicle and crashed. I also could have had my small child with me and been trying to deal with getting help on the side of a highway with a toddler who doesn\u2019t understand to stay away from the roadway. I am thankful all was well but engine stalls when the manufacturer knows there is a defect is putting peoples\u2019 lives at risk.",

        "summary": "I was driving on I-64 (eastbound), east of Richmond, VA heading home to Virginia Beach, VA.  I noticed a knocking sound, intermittent at first, but becoming more prevalent and much louder.  By the time I got home, the engine knocking was horrible.  I looked under the car, and saw some oil around the oil pan, but there was still sufficient oil in the engine (halfway between the MIN/MAX marks on the dipstick.  At no time, before during, or since was there any warning lamps lit on the dash, nor were there any codes that could be pulled indicating an issue.  We had the car towed to Hall Hyundai in Chesapeake, VA (that's where we bought it), and they said the engine was full of metal and needed to be replaced.  They did not say exactly what failed in the engine, but my suspicion is one of the pistons had a catastrophic failure.  That was on 11 DEC.  The engine has since been replaced with a remanufactured engine, but we still do not have our car back.  After the initial repair, we noticed a puddle of oil on our garage floor.  The car is back at the dealership and they've found 3 separate leaks so far.  In reading of similar engine failures with our year range of Hyundai Santa Fe, we were fortunate.  Our failure could have led to an immediate engine failure, engine fire, or worse that could have caused a serious accident since I was travelling on the highway.  My concern is that Hyundai to date has dismissed this as nothing more than a fluke, and since we're beyond the terms of the warranty, not their problem.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  This is a BIG problem since the component that failed in our 3.3L V6 is the same component that forced a recall of their 2.4L 4-cyclinder that is common in their Santa Fe Sport model.  I guarantee you that they use the same process, materials, etc. in the pistons for both, and this warrants a recall for our model/engine type just like the 2.4L recall.",

Engine code that caused the lights was P2159 (Vehicle Speed Sensor B range performance) I took the car to Jim Click dealership in Green Valley they had the car for 7 days said they finally figured out that it had wires that were shorted that fed back to modules and they would have to do an overlay of these wires, so they would run new wires in the area that was bad, we got the car back after repairs and it is all working now, the car only has 86 k miles and has never been in an accident all wiring in the vehicle look still brand new. I read online of this same year of car has problems due to engine fires and suggest to park car away from anything in case it does catch fire, the article also talks about it starts with the antilock brake control module that can cause an electrical short. I am wandering if this is going to happen again because they repaired shorted wiring but did nothing to replace any bad control modules that may be causing fires in these vehicles. These repairs cost me over 700 dollars in which I think should be under warranty, But the real scary thing is I don't want to be driving down the road and have this car go up in flames.

The engine in the car began making a strange knocking sound halfway through the trip, but the engine light did not illuminate. We thankfully made it home safely. I had my local mechanic take a look at the car and he said that the knocking sound is considered the death knell of any engine. I was shocked. How could a well-maintained 5 year old car's engine need to be replaced? I called Hyundai and they advised me to bring the car to a dealership for a service manager to diagnose and call them after three days to submit a claim. For our own safety I had the car towed to the local dealership, they serviced and diagnosed as a knocking sound coming from the bearings.  The engine failed during examination. I have been submitting, resubmitting, and escalating claims since.  The claims manager in corporate rejected my claim because the test they perform to diagnose the engine as defective requires that the engine be running. This is obviously a circular argument created to reject claims. I have since read court documents for the class actions suits describing the issues that Hyundai so far refuses to acknowledge and address (other than through updates and recalls that don't resolve the root of the problem) regarding their manufacturing and design defects that lead to premature engine wear and damage. The manufacturing process leaves metal debris (also known as swarf) in the engines and/or poorly machined engine components resulting in metal on metal contact in the rotating assembly of the engine leading to catastrophic engine failure. Hyundai is with full knowledge of the issues (all of these problems have been reported to the NHTSA for many years now) marketing, selling and distributing under false and fraudulent pretenses their cars to the general public. This is unjust, unsafe, unlawful and fraudulent.  This is not right and can no longer go on. Something must be done.",

They continued to tell me there was nothing wrong with it and made me seem like I was the crazy one. Fast-forwarding to December 2020, I started to now hear this metal clacking noise from the engine. Made a 3rd appointment at the dealer that was a week out - but never MADE IT. Because few days before it, I was going out to a friend's and clacking started to get even louder - as LOUD could hear in the cabin. THEN as about to get onto highway on-ramp WITH NO WARNING- no check engine light - no notice whatsoever - engine rpm spiked loudly and a very loud pop followed - and engine totally ceased. Lost total engine propulsion - vehicle rolled to a stop and then all lights and sounds started going off with check engine light NOW FLASHING. HAD TO have HYUNDAI towed to the dealer - in which \"there was an engine rod bearing failure - which caused the engine to cease. Dealer took days to even get it seen and wouldn't give a loaner till deemed a fault under \"warranty\" which clearly was with there 10 yr - 100,000 mile warranty - which makes sense because there poorly made/crafted engine designs that involve the GDI ENGINES_ which have been known to fail prematurely - CAUSE FIRES _ and has even killed people. They aren't fixing the engine design they simply are putting the same KIND IN>>> and putting a system that detects engine knocking. THAT DOESNT FIX THE PROBLEM - and they KNOW THAT.

THE NEXT MORNING I SCHEDULED SERVICE RIGHT AWAY. I STARTED MY CAR TO GO TO SCHWARTZ MAZDA IN SHREWSBURY NJ ON 7/27/19 FOR SERVICE THRU MY PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY. AT THAT TIME, NEITHER THE AIRBAG OR SEATBELT LIGHTS WERE ON, BUT NERVOUS FOR MINE AND MY FAMILY'S SAFETY, I BROUGHT THE CAR ANYWAY. I WAS INFORMED BY JARROD IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY RESET MY COMPUTER AND TO LET HIM KNOW IF THE LIGHT(S) CAME BACK ON. THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON BRIEFLY ON AUGUST 11TH WHILE DRIVING ON A RESIDENTIAL ROAD GOING 35 MPH ON A DRY AND SUNNY DAY.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE TO PARK AND THEN RESTARTED MY CAR TO RETURN HOME. THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON. MONDAY AUGUST 19TH WHILE TRAVELING ON A COUNTY ROAD AT 45 MPH IN RAINY WET DRIVING CONDITIONS AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON ACCOMPANIED BY THE FLASHING PASSENGER SEAT BELT LIGHT AGAIN. MADE AN APPT FOR SERVICE ON  TUESDAY, AUGUST 20TH WITH ONCE AGAIN, SCHWARTZ MAZDA IN SHREWSBURY NJ WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN MAY OF 2018. BOTH LIGHTS WERE ON UPON MY ARRIVAL IN SUNNY AND DRY DRIVING CONDITIONS. THEIR CODE READER PRODUCED THE CODE \"PASSENGER MAT SENSOR\" AND I WAS INFORMED THEY WOULD HAVE TO SEND IT TO CIRCLE HYUNDAI IN SHREWSBURY FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSIS. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM JARROD AT SCHWARTZ MAZDA AT 11 AM ON THURSDAY AUGUST 22 WITH NEWS THAT MY REPAIR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD COST ALMOST $600.   I AM FEARFUL FOR MY FAMILY'S SAFETY AND THE RESOURCES I HAVE REACHED OUT TO HAVE BEEN USELESS AND UNACCOMODATING.
