Being a 40 year Automotive Technician for GM, I am familiar with pulling codes and replacing parts.  I called the dealership to see if this was covered by warranty and was told no.  After pulling the codes, I personally replaced the Throttle Body Sensor and the Accelerator Pedal Assembly, but the vehicle continued to go into Reduced Engine Power mode.  I took the vehicle into the dealership and they diagnosed the cause as a corroded connector.  The connector was replaced and the vehicle was returned to me.  After a little over one month and less than 1,000 miles the vehicle is once again going into Reduced Engine Power mode.  I can have my vehicle available for inspection if necessary.",

THE COVER OF THE STEERING WHEEL, WHICH BEARS A PLASTIC GMC LOGO THAT IS HEAVIER THAN THE REST OF THE MATERIAL BLEW EXACTLY ON THE CORNER OF THE G.  DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE SPLIT THE LOGO HIT MY WRIST LIKE A HAMMER CAUSING NERVE DAMAGE AND PERMANENTLY STAMPING THE GMC LOGO ON MY WRIST.  I CURRENTLY POSSESS ALL DEPLOYED SRS COMPONENTS ALONG WITH THE ACM THAT WAS IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF DEPLOYMENT.  THE DAMAGE, ASIDE FROM THE SRS COMPONENTS, WAS ONLY TO THE BUMPER, GRILL, AND CONDENSER WITH MINOR DAMAGE TO THE CORE SUPPORT WHERE THE BUMPER MOUNTS (RADIATOR, FENDERS, AND HOOD WERE NOT IMPACTED).  I QUESTION THE SAFETY OF THE WAY THE STEERING WHEEL SPLIT AS THE EDGE OF THE G HAS A SHARP EDGE THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SLIT MY WRIST OPEN.  I ALSO QUESTION THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE BAG DUE TO NO SUDDEN DECELERATION AND THAT IF THE BAG HAD NOT BEEN DEPLOYED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO INJURY IN THIS LOSS. ALSO I HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD AN ISSUE WHERE I STARTED THE VEHICLE ON THE FIRST COLD DAY, ALL WARNING LIGHTS ON DASH CAME ON AND ADVISED ME TO SERVICE ALL SYSTEMS.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND RESTARTED AND THERE WAS NO WARNINGS PRESENT.  AFTER THE LOSS AND REPAIRS I EXPERIENCED THIS SAME ISSUE BUT IT WOULD NOT RESOLVE BY RESTARTING THE VEHICLE.  THEY PULLED CODES AT THE DEALERSHIP AND PERFORMED A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE.  IT WAS COLD DURING THE LOSS BUT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN RUNNING SEVERAL HOURS AS I WAS DRIVING CROSS COUNTRY AT THE TIME.",

I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRUCK VERY WEIRD ISSUES THAT DON'T MAKE MECHANICAL SENSE. ALSO THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER GAUGES AND INFOTAINMENT SCREEN DON'T LIGHT UP JUST BLACK SCREENS AFTER STARTING VEHICLE. HAPPENED 2 TIMES NOW. RADIO WAS OFF WHILE DRIVING THEN CAME ON FULL VOLUME WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING. SERVICE STABILITY /STEERING WARNING CAME ON ONCE.I CAN HEAR FRONT TRANSFER CASE ENGAGE AND DISENGAGE AT LOW SPEEDS RANDOMLY WHEN IN 2WD. RANDOMLY STUCK IN LOW GEAR WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP.
