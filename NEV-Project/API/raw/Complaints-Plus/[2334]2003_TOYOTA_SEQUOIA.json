        "summary": "Hello,  I am writing to you to have an investigation started on 2003 Toyota Sequoia, I own one and there has been concerns with the Frame of the vehicle rotting out, there was Warranty Enhancement Program sent out in United States to cover frames of 2001 to 2004 Toyota Sequoias which replaced severely rusted out frames at the dealership. I use this vehicle for my family and I do not want to endanger the lives of them and the people around the community where the frame may break due to rust and cause a severe accident. Please take a look at the details below and get back to me.  Subject: Limited Service Campaign (LSC) CSD Certain 2001 through 2004 Model Year Sequoia Vehicles Frame Inspection  I am located in Canada would like NHSTA to investigate and see if this program can be administered to vehicles in Canada since I have severe rotting of the frame and I have had to have it welded many times to not compromise the safety of the vehicle",

It has been replaced 3 times after purchase of my vehicle , by the following Toyota dealerships (Tejas Toyota in Humble Texas (2x); Maund  Toyota in Austin, Tx (1x). Each dealership service said it was/is manufacture defect with the latch hook  and it stops \u201cun latching when the vehicle the button is pressed to unlock  and the handle can not open the hatchback\u201d  This time I was traveling out of state with my pet in the kennel and when we stopped for restroom break the latch would not open to retrieve the pet to let out the kennel. We were traveling with a vehicle full of items, which the entire inside of the vehicle had to be emptied I ordered  to let all the seats down and try to maneuver to try to get my dog out of kennel I. Such a small confined space that was hard to open because it was in the side. It took over and hour to cut the cage at the top to retrieve my pet.  The sad part is there was no warning because we were traveling  a 13 hour trip, stopping every couple hours for breaks and stretches, and the couple hours before we open the hatchback just fine. This is more than a safety concern for the animal.  This is also the ares for retrieving the spare tire underneath the vehicle when the spare has to be released.   I have replaced the part 3 times and I am charged $600 cost for parts and labor, when Toyota is aware of the defect.  I just had the part replaced 19 months ago and Toyota only gives a 12 warranty on the part. This is ludicrous when the manufacture is aware of the ongoing problem. I have purchased 4 prior Toyota\u2019s  and never had had this type of problem.   My second safety issue is the case gage drops below the empty gage and stays there even though there is gas in the vehicle. The dealership said there was a recall years ago but I never received any notice. Please advise.",

KOLOSSO SAID IT HAD TO ORDER THE SPECIAL \"KIT\" TO APPLY MATERIAL TO MY FRAME AND SCHEDULED MY INSPECTION AND APPLICATION FOR EARLY AUGUST 2014, AFTER 7-31-14 (DUE DATE). THEY SAID THE KIT WOULDN'T ARRIVE UNTIL AUGUST AND THERE WAS NOTHING ANYONE COULD DO. EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE BECAUSE THE KIT WOULDN'T EVEN BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AUGUST 2014. I RECEIVED A FRANTIC CALL FROM KOLOSSO ON 7-13-14 WHILE I WAS WORKING LITERALLY 2 HOURS AWAY IN MILWAUKEE, WI THAT MY TRUCK HAD TO BE INSPECTED IN APPLETON THAT DAY IN ORDER FOR THE RECALL TO BE VALID. KOLOSSO SAID IT WAS THEIR FAULT FOR SCHEDULING ME IN AUGUST 2014 BUT TOYOTA SUDDENLY DEEMED 7-31-14 THE ABSOLUTE DEADLINE FOR THE RECALL. SO I HAD TO LEAVE WORK UNEXPECTEDLY TO DRIVE 2 HOURS AWAY FOR INSPECTION. AN EXTREME INCONVENIENCE! THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT COMPENSATE ME IN ANY WAY FOR MY UPSET. THEY PLACED ALL BLAME SQUARELY ON TOYOTA. I SAID, AS A CUSTOMER, I HAD DONE EVERYTHING THE DEALERSHIP SAID AND I HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG. THIS ARGUMENT WAS BETWEEN KOLOSSO AND TOYOTA BUT I WAS PENALIZED.  AS OF THIS DATE, 2 YEARS LATER, KOLOSSO HAS STILL NOT APPLIED THE SPECIAL COATING TO MY FRAME TO PREVENT CORROSION. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A CALL FROM THEM TO SCHEDULE THIS.I FEEL THIS IS ILLEGAL. I COMPLIED FULLY WITH THE RECALL BY THE DEADLINE.  I HAVE RECEIVED NO INDEMNIFICATION IN ANY CAPACITY. AND SINCE THAT TIME, I'VE GOTTEN RECALL NOTICES FOR OTHER THINGS BUT IF KOLOSSO WON'T HELP ME, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? THEY'RE A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. I AM A COMPLETELY DISGUSTED TOYOTA VICTIM WITH A BODY FRAME THAT IS LIKELY CORRODED.",

SPOKE WITH  HEAD OF MAINTENANCE REGARDING ISSUE & RESOLUTION. OUTCOME: FRAME REPLACED @ NO COST BUT, IF CERTAIN PARTS ARE BROKEN DURNING THE REMOVALS OR INSTALLATION THE COST IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THE FRAME WILL TAKE 1-2 MONTH TO ORDER. TOLD THAT THEY WILL NOT OFFER A RENTAL DURING THAT TIME & THE VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE \"I WOULDN'T LET YOU LEAVE IF IT WASN'T SAFE.\"      INITIATED A TOYOTA CLAIM NUMBER, SHOULD BE CONTACTED BY CASE MANAGER WITHIN 24 BUSINESS HOURS. NO CONTACT YET.    UPON RESEARCHING LIKE ISSUES WITH THE SAME MAKE/MODEL/YEAR. A LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE HANDED A VERY LARGE BILL AFTER THE FRAME INSTALLATION & ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE ISSUES STEMMING FROM THE FRAME REPLACEMENT. THE COSTS ARE NOT BEING COVERED BY TOYOTA.    I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY VEHICLE IN FEAR THAT I WILL CRASH/BE INJURED OR CAUSE SOMEONE ELSE TO CRASH/BE INJURED. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT TOYOTA IS NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR RECALL/SERVICE.    *JS",

THEN THEY CALLED ME TO TELL ME IT WOULD COST $6,400.00 TO REPLACE EVERYTHING UNDER THE VEHICLE, BECAUSE IT WAS SO RUSTED OUT THAT WHEN THEY TOOK THE PARTS OFF THEY WOULD CRUMBLE.  TWO DAYS LATER THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $6,900.00  TO REPLACE PARTS.  THEY CALLED LAST NIGHT AND SAID IT WOULD COST ME $7,845.00 AND THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THE PRICE WOULD NOT BE HIGHER.THEY SENT ME PICTURES OF MY FRAME AND THERE IS A LARGE HOLE IN THE FRAME. MY QUESTION IS SHOULDN'T I GET MY TRUCK BACK IN WORKING CONDITION WITHOUT ME PAYING FOR ANYTHING? I CONTACTED TOYOTA IN CA.  AND TALKED TO THE RUST SPECIALIST, AND HE SAID THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR MY PARTS. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE RETIRED AND LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME.  WE CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE PARTS.  THE TRUCK HAS BEEN PAID FOR ONCE, WHY SHOULD I TAKE OUT A LOAN FOR A TRUCK THAT HAS BEEN PAID FOR. THE DEALER ALSO ASKED US TO COME PICK UP MY TRUCK IF I WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE TO  PAY FOR THE PARTS. WHEN I PICKED UP MY TRUCK TODAY, THEY SAID IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO THE TRUCK WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT HOME, THEY WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT FIXED.

I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE AOG COMPUTER, AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS UPDATE WOULD MOST LIKELY FILX THE PROBLEM.  AFTER THE AOG WAS UPDATED12 MAR 2011, NOW BOTH THE BRAKE LIGHT AND THE VSC TRACK OFF LIGHTS COME ON, AND THE BRAKES SHUDDER TO A STOP.  UNFORTUNATELY THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN EACH AND EVERYTIME I'M DRIVING THE CAR, BUT RATHER SPORADICALLY.  I'VE TAKEN THE SUV BACK TO THE DEALER, AND THEY SEEM TO BE GUESSING AS TO THE PROBLEM, AND SOLUTION.  THEY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER, HOWEVER BLOGS THAT I HAVE READ ON THIS ISSUE INDICATE CHANGING THESE PARTICULAR PARTS WILL NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  MY PERSONAL MECHANIC HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER ARE NOT THE ISSUE, BUT RATHER RELATED TO THE WHOLE BREAKING COMPUTER SYSTEM.  HE STRONGLY SUGGESTED THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT TOYOTA SHOULD ADDRESS AND FIX.  THAT IN FACT THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM PERTAINING TO THE SKID CONTROL COMPUTER AND ECM.   I'VE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE AS A FAMILY VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT MY FAMILY, AND I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL SAFE USING THIS VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT ANY ONE IN.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS WHOLE BRAKING MECHANISM.  *TR",

A TRIP TO THE DEALER, (ALONG WITH  THE MANDATORY $105 DIAGNOSTIC CHARGE), RESULTED IN THE CLAIM THAT THE OXYGEN SENSOR AND YAW RATE SENSOR NEED TO BE REPLACED FOR ABOUT $1200.     IN MY OPINION, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR TWO UNRELATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE OXYGEN SENSOR AND YAW RATE SENSOR TO FAIL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A LONG, SLIMY RECORD OF INCORRECTLY DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS AND UNNECESSARY REPLACING EXPENSIVE PARTS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE REPAIR BILL. I BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY BE ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS.     A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE MANY THOUSANDS OF TOYOTA OWNERS WHO HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM. MOST HAVE ALSO GIVEN THE TOYOTA SERVICE CENTERS FAILING MARKS FOR HOW THE PROBLEM WAS EVALUATED AND REPAIRED.     IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT THE OXYGEN SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE AS A VEHICLE AGES. THE YAW RATE SENSOR IS A CRITICAL VEHICLE HANDLING COMPONENT THAT SHOULD BE ENGINEERED TO LAST FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. IF THIS COMPONENT HAS FAILED, (WHICH I DOUBT), IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER AT NO COST TO THE VEHICLE OWNER.      THE ALLEGED YAW RATE SENSOR FAILURE IS SUSPICIOUS FOR ANOTHER REASON. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE RELATING TO THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THE CAR HAD NOT SHOWN ANY PROBLEMS UP TO THE TIME OF THE RECALL REPAIR.

ON BOTH OCCASIONS I WAS ABLE TO APPLY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO FINALLY STOP THE VEHICLE.    I CHECKED THE FLOOR MAT, AS DID THE TOYOTA DEALER, AND FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH IT.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE TOYOTA DEALER ON DECEMBER 20, 2010.

I TURNED IT OFF AND TRIED AGAIN AND THE VSC LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN BUT IT DROVE OK UNTIL THE NEXT TIME I RESTARTED IT AGAIN GOT OUT IN TRAFFIC AND IT MADE THE SAME GRINDING NOISE, STALLED AND THE BRAKES PULLED IT TO THE RIGHT AGAIN....I HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE AND WAS NEARLY HIT BY THE CAR IN THE RIGHT LANE.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE SAID IT JUST NEEDED RECALIBRATING AND THE COST WOULD BE AROUND $100. I TOOK IT IN AND THE WHOLE SKID CONTROL COMPUTER HAD TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1400 PLUS LABOR $200.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW IN 2003 AND THIS IS THE 3RD VSC ISSUE I HAVE HAD. THE LAST ONE WAS $600 2 OR 3 YEARS AGO.  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED OR AT LEAST A FIX SENT TO DEALERSHIPS WHEN THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE IN WARRANTY. THE REST HAVE BEEN OUT OF MY POCKET. *TR",

I TRADED MY 2001 SR5 IN FOR THIS ONE BECAUSE THE VSC TRAC LIGHTS KEPT GOING ON IN IT TOO BUT THE ELECTRIC WINDOWS STOPPED WORKING AS WELL. WE BOUGHT THE 36 MONTHS, 36,000 MILE EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH THE SALESMAN TOLD US WOULD COVER \"EVERYTHING\" BUMPER TO BUMPER AND THAT IT WAS \"BETTER\" THAN THE PREVIOUS CERTIFIED PLATINUM EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WE HAD PURCHASED WITH OUR 2001 SR5. I BOUGHT THIS 2003 SR5 ON 12-15-07 AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH THE LIGHTS OR SKIDDING. I WAS TAKING MY GRANDSON TO THE DENTIST WHEN IT HAPPENED AND IT WAS SCARY. THANK GOD NO ONE GOT HURT. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE SKID CONTROL REPLACEMENT IS NOT COVERED AND THAT THE COST FOR REPAIRS WOULD BE $2,000.  WELL I DO NOT HAVE $2,000 TO PAY FOR THIS.  I REMEMBERED HAVING RECEIVED A QUESTIONNAIRE IN THE MAIL A MONTH OR SO AGO FROM THE NHTSA REQUESTING INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE VSC TRAC AND SLIP INDICATOR LIGHTS SO I DID FILL IT OUT AND SEND IT IN, HOWEVER I HAD ONLY HAD THE VSC LIGHTS GO ON AT THAT POINT AND ONLY RECENTLY THE SLIP INDICATOR LIGHT AND BUZZER STARED GOING OFF.  IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS A DEFECTIVE PART & HAZARDOUS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED. I HAVE LEFT MY CAR AT THE DEALER AND WILL HAVE IT TOWED HOME AS IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE LIKE THAT AS I DO NOT HAVE THE $2,000 TO FIX IT.  I SPOKE WITH GARY HEWITT AT NHTSA ON 11/04/09 AND HE SAID THAT MICHAEL PACKARD WOULD BE BACK IN THE OFFICE ON 11/16/09 IN OHIO AND SINCE HE IS CONDUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION, WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO SEE MY CAR BEFORE REPAIRS. *TR",

ON OCCASION THE ENGINE LIGHT WOULD ALSO COME ON. SOMETIMES I WOULD HAVE A FOOT ON THE GAS & IT FELT LIKE THE BRAKE WAS BEING APPLIED. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN SEVERAL TIMES, AND THEY SAID THEIR WASN'T AN ISSUE. I LEFT IT OVERNIGHT AND THE LIGHTS DIDN'T COME ON AT 2000 MILES. THIS CONTINUED SPORADICALLY FOR A YEAR USUALLY DURING COLDER WEATHER. IN JANUARY 2004 AT 16,870 MILES THE VCS/TRAC CAME ON WHEN NEAR TOYOTA AND FINALLY WAS VALIDATED & REPLACED DUE TO TSB BR002-03, PART#89630-0C011. THE ISSUE STILL CONTINUES STILL IN COLDER WEATHER. IN DECEMBER 2005, AT 48,000 THE VCS/TRAC & ENGINE LIGHT WERE ON, AND STAYED ON ALL DAY & TOYOTA REPLACE THE CAT CONVERTER. TWO WEEKS LATER I RETURN WITH ALL THREE LIGHTS ON & THEY REPLACE THE CAT CONVERTER AGAIN. NOW THE ISSUES ARE SPORADIC ALL YEAR LONG. IN AUGUST 2008 AT 89,000 MILES DURING SERVICE WORK THEY ARE ABLE TO PULL CODES WITH VSC/TRAC LIGHTS OFF. THEY REPLACE ECM TO CORRECT STEERING ANGLE & DECELERATION. THE LIGHTS STILL CAME ON LAST WEEK AGAIN AT START UP AND THE VEHICLE SLOWED DOWN PULLING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY. STILL LOOKING FOR A RESOLUTION...  *TR",

I HAD BEEN ADVISED TO GO IN FOR TOYOTA CAMPAIGN SSC 50J FOR  BALL JOINT SAFETY RECALL. THIS WAS DONE AT FREMONT TOYOTA ON MAY 30, 2008.    2. ON JUNE 12, 2008, THE VEHICLE SKID CONTROL AND TRACTION CONTROL STARTS DISENGAGING ON ITS OWN, WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON US 101 NORTH FREEWAY ON MY WAY HOME FROM A TRIP TO MONTERREY BAY AQUARIUM.    3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: THE VSC/ATRAC INDICATOR LIGHTS CHANGES STATE TO ON AND THE SYSTEM WILL INADVERTENTLY   ENGAGE AND DISENGAGE WITHOUT ANY WARNING. TO RESET,I HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY AND RESTART THE   VEHICLE. THE PROBLEM REPEATED A DOZEN TIMES,  UNTIL I REACHED HOME. SO I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO FREMONT TOYOTA ON JUNE 14, 2008 AND WAS TOLD THERE IS ERROR CODE C1231 AND C1203 AND THE REASON IS FAULTY ENGINE AND TRACTION CONTROL COMPUTERS.    4. I WAS NOT CONVINCED WITH THE ANSWER AND DECIDED TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON THE NHTSA SITE AND DISCUSSION FORUMS ON THE NET AND FOUND OUT THAT TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE, TOYOTA MODIFIED ITS SKID CONTROL LOGIC AND THE VSC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SKID CONTROL COMPUTER AND THE ENGINE CONTROL MODULE TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM (PLEASE REFER NHTSA# 00303 & BR00203, DIAGNOSTICS CODES C1231 & C1203).     5. I CALLED UP FREMONT TOYOTA IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHAT I FOUND OUT AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT I HAD TO  REPLACE THE EXISTING VSC & ECU COMPUTERS, WITH UPDATED/REDESIGNED MODULES AT MY EXPENSE (COSTS OF $2700)    I THINK THIS IS UNREASONABLE SINCE, I CONSIDER THIS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT SINCE THE FIX CALLS FOR A COMPUTER UPGRADE. I AM WRITING TO LET YOUR OFFICE KNOW THAT TOYOTA DEALER AND TOYOTA NORTH AMERICA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.  I CAN BE REACHED AT (510) 471-6937 IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR STATED THAT BASED THE DIAGNOSTIC REPAIR CODES AND A REPAIR BULLETIN, HE RECOMMENDED A THAT THE SKID CONTROL ECU BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1667.00    THIS REPAIR RECOMMENDATION WHAT DISAPPOINTING FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS:    1.THIS IS A REPAIR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE PREVIOUSLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE VSC LIGHT TO A TOYOTA SERVICE TECHNICIAN WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  THE SOLUTION BY THE TOYOTA OF LONG BEACH REPAIR FACILITY WAS TO SIMPLY 'RESET' THE ECU.   ATTACHED IS THE INVOICE.  2.SECONDLY, THE ECU IS NOT A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO ONGOING MAINTENANCE. IT IS A COMPUTER CHIP THAT IS DESIGNED TO CONTROL THE VSC, ETC. IF THE ECU CAN NOT BE REPROGRAMMED TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED, THEN THIS DESIGN FLAW THAT AGAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY OR AS RECALL.  3.THE DESIGN FLAW IS SERIOUS AND CRITICALLY AFFECTS THE SAFETY AND STABILITY OF THE VEHICLE.    4.FINALLY, THE ECU IS ESSENTIALLY A SMALL COMPUTER AND THE $1600 PRICE TAG TO REPLACE SUCH AND INEXPENSIVE PART IS ABSURD.

I AM ALSO FILING A REPORT ABOUT THE NEW REAR WINDOW MOTOR AND HATCH RELEASE HANDLE I HAD TO REPLACE IN JULY ON THIS VEHICLE WHICH ALSO  IS MENTIONED IN MANY REPORTS I'VE READ ON THE INTERNET. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY FAILURES ON THE LIGHT SITUATION I'VE HAD BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE DOZENS.  *TR",

WE ARE VERY UPSET BECAUSE WE CALL TOYOTA AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THEY REFER ME TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER THAT PROBABLY CAN OFFER ME A DISCOUNT OUTSIDE WARRANTY.  WE NEED NHTSA TO START INVESTIGATING THIS ISSUE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF USERS THAT ALREADY PAID FOR THIS REPAIR THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT.   DON'T LET THIS ISSUE GET OUT OF HAND,  PLEASE DON'T WAINT UNTIL THERE ARE PEOPLE HURT.   MY TRUCK IS WORTH AROUND 14,000 THE REPAIR IS 2500  THE REPAIR IS 18% WORTH OF THE WHOLE VEHICLE.    TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IF THEY SELL A CAR WITH DEFECTIVE PARTS THEY SHOULD REPLACE IT. *TR",

WENT ON TO A DEFECTIVE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR, PUNGENT AWFUL SMELL FROM THE AC, DEFECTIVE RADIO/ CD CHANGER. BRAKES ARE SPONGY AND DON'T RESPOND WELL. IF YOU PUMP IT ONCE IT WORKS WELL. THE VEHICLE REPEATEDLY VEERS TO THE RIGHT. THEY HAVE CHECKED IT AT LEAST 15 TIMES. THERE IS HAIR IN THE PAINT. I WENT THROUGH THE NCDS PROCESS AND ENDED UP WITH A JUDGMENT TO HAVE THEM REPAIR THE VEERING PROBLEM AND AIR CONDITIONING. TOYOTA NEVER COMPLIED AND NCDS CLOSED THE CASE WITHOUT MY CONSENT. I WORKED WITH TOYOTA AND THEY FINALLY WORKED ON THE TROUBLE. I GOT A NEW SET OF TIRES BUT THE VEERING RETURNED. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE TIRES WEAR MORE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE. AS YOU ROTATE THE TROUBLE GOES AWAY UNTIL THE TIRE WEARS AND THE PROBLEM BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCES. NOW THE TIRES ARE BALD AND NCDS IS GIVING ME TROUBLE TO REOPEN THE CASE OR STAND BEHIND THE ARBITRATORS JUDGMENT. NOW EVEN THE DOOR MOLDING ARE COMING OFF EVEN WITH NO DAMAGE. *JB",

NEXT CAME THE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE IT ALWAYS READ LOW. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS FIXED,  THE CAUSE WAS A FAULTY SENDER, NO CHARGE TO ME. ON A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE I ASKED FOR THE ALARM TO BE CHECK BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS SILENT. TO MY SURPRISE THE HORN HAD COME OFF LUCKY FOR ME IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY SO IT WAS REPLACED. ALL THIS TIME THE VSC/ TRAC OFF LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON. THE DEALER CAN'T COME UP WITH A PROBLEM AND THEY SAY JUST RESTART THE CAR AND THEY SHOULD COME OFF. NOW THERE IS A GRINDING SOUND COMING FROM MY DASH AND THE LIGHTS ARE COMING ON AGAIN SO OFF TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN. THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE THE SOUND AND THE LIGHTS WELL MAYBE ITS MY BRAKES AND I HAVE TO GET THOSE REPLACED. I DECIDED TO WAIT ON THAT.  OK NOW SINCE MY KIDS LIKE TO RIDE WITH THE BACK WINDOWS DOWN AND I CAN'T STAND THE PRESSURE AND SOUND IN THE CAR. (IT SOUND AS IF I'M IN A HELICOPTER) I DECIDE TO ROLL THE BACK WINDOW DOWN TO STABALIZE THE PRESSURE AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK AND NOW MY VSC / TRAC OFF AND ABS LIGHTS ARE ALL ON \"ALL THE TIME\" .  NOW I'M AT THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN (EVERYONE THERE KNOWS ME BY NAME NOW) . THE VSC/ TRAC OFF AND ABS LIGHT WELL THAT WAS A SENSOR THAT NEEDED REPLACING AND THE WINDOW WELL GUESS WHAT THAT WAS THE GRINDING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE . THE MOTOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. BE READY TO PAY ABOUT $800 IN PARTS AND LABOR. LUCKY FOR ME I HAD PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SO I WAS LEFT WITH JUST MY DEDUCTIBLE. I HAVE OWNED 3 TOYOTAS IN THE PAST AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT PEACE OF MIND \"ITS A TOYOTA\" BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE. TOYOTA IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. I STILL LOVE THE SPACE AND COMFORT OF THE SEQUOIA BUT WOULD RATHER DO WITHOUT ALL THE SERVICE TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP.",

AFTER MAKING SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE DEALERSHIP, I AM NOW WRITING TO YOU AS A LAST RESORT. MY VEHICLE EXPELS A VERY STRONG AMMONIA SMELL FROM THE VENT SYSTEM AFTER ACCELERATION. THE SMELL HAS BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE SNEEZE OR YOUR EYES WATERY. THE THIRD AND FINAL TIME I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A SOLUTION, THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME HE HAD CONTACTED TOYOTA MANUFACTURER MECHANICS. THEY STATED IT WAS A CONDENSATION SMELL FROM THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM THAT WAS VERY COMMON. THEY SUGGESTED USING THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM MORE OFTEN. I INFORMED HIM I WAS AWARE OF THAT SMELL BUT THAT WAS ALSO DIFFERENT FROM THE AMMONIA. THE REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THEY WOULD CONTACT ME WHEN THE MANUFACTURER HAD A SOLUTION. HE WANTED TO SET UP ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO SERVICE MY CAR, BUT I REFUSED. TOYOTA TOWN HAD THE CAR TWICE BEFORE TO CHECK THE PROBLEM AND DID NOT COME UP WITH A SOLUTION, BUT WAS ONLY ABLE TO INCONVENIENCE ME FROM GETTING TO WORK ETC.  I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE FOR 9 MONTHS AND CANNOT RELAX BECAUSE I HAVE AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED, BUT YET I AM PAYING FOR IT. THE AMMONIA SMELL IS NOT NORMAL AND IT IS NOT COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT STAND BY THEIR WORD AND TRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER.
