IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS AGO (I BOUGHT IT NEW), AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YEAR THAT WAS, BUT I DID CONTACT VW ON THIS, AND BELIEVE I ALSO SENT AN E-MAIL TO BOTH NHTSA & IIHS ON THIS.    THIS IS AN INEXCUSABLE DESIGN (GM IS HAVING A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH ITS IGNITION SWITCH & AIRBAGS BEING TURNED OFF).    THE SEATBELT LATCH WAS REPLACED, AND HAS BEEN WORKING FINE FOR YEARS NOW.  IT CURRENTLY HAS 167,000+ MILES ON IT.    IT DOES HAVE SOME POSITIVES. THE FRONT BRAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN REPLACED, AND DIDN'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE REAR BRAKES UNTIL 90,000.  THE CLUTCH HAS NEVER BEEN REPLACED, AND STILL WORKS GOOD (EVEN WITH A TON OF STOP-N-GO TRAFFIC).    THERE SHOULD BE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT ALL OF THE AIRBAGS ARE ALWAYS ON, NO MATTER WHAT, WHEN THE VEHICLE IS MOVING, WHETHER OR NOT THE IGNITION IS ON, THE SEATBELTS ARE LATCH, ETC.    ALSO, THERE SHOULD BE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT ALL REAR TURN SIGNAL LIGHTS MUST BE BRIGHT ORANGE, NOT RED.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT STANDS OUT AS A TURN SIGNAL, WHEREAS A BLINKING RED LIGHT COULD BE THE DRIVER TAPPING ON THE BRAKES. NOT EASY TO TELL WHEN YOU CAN ONLY SEE ONE CORNER OF A VEHICLE.  *TR",

(I WENT TO 3 SEPARATE DEALERSHIPS IN 3 DIFFERENT CITIES.)    IT TURNED OUT TO BE A DEFECTIVE SEATBELT LATCH SENSOR.

FIVE VW EXPERTS EMPLOYED WITH OR ASSOCIATED WITH ROGER JOBS VW (ANGELA MATTIX THE SERVICE ADVISER, PETER DRAKE THE SERVICE MANAGER, DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE JUAN GARCIA, AND TWO TECHNICIANS, BOB GORSUCH AND PAUL TIEGROB), UNANIMOUSLY AGREE AND ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY CERTAIN, THAT BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM, THE OIL FILTER CAP SPLITTING WAS DUE TO AN OVER TIGHTENING OF THE CAP BY THE SELLING DEALERSHIP (PACIFIC VW), AND, WAS NOT THE RESULT OF, AS CLAIMED BY PACIFIC VW AND SUPPORTED BY VW OF AMERICA, A STONE FLYING UP UNDERNEATH THE CAR, WHICH WOULD CLASSIFY IT AS DAMAGE DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES, THEREBY EXCLUDING IT FROM COVERAGE UNDER THE LIMITED NEW VEHICLE WARRANTY.  AS POINTED OUT BY THE FIVE VW EMPLOYEES LISTED ABOVE, THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE IS STRONGLY PROTECTED AGAINST SUCH OCCURRENCES WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS OF HARD PLASTIC SHIELDS, ALL OF WHICH SHOW NO SIGN WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT OPINION OF FIVE VW EMPLOYEES, IT''S CLEAR, THAT THE FAILURE OF THE OIL FILTER CAP WAS DUE TO FAULTY SERVICE ON THE PART OF PACIFIC VW, AND WAS NOT DAMAGE DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES.  *NM",
