        "summary": "MY MOTOR HOME CAME EQUIPPED WITH THE IOTA ITS-50R TRANSFER SWITCH. IN JULY 2010 IT CAUSED A FIRE IN THE COACH WHICH WAS EXTINGUISHED BY ME AND A NEW TRANSFER SWITCH OF THE SAME MANUFACTURER WAS INSTALLED ON 29 JULY 2010.  ON 25 NOV 2015 THE REPLACEMENT TRANSFER SWITCH FAILED (NO FIRE THIS TIME) AND WILL RESULT IN MY HAVING TO REPLACE IT AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH ANOTHER BRAND OF TRANSFER SWITCH.  I CALLED MONACO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMPLAINED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE INITIAL RECALL OF 2012.  THEY STATED THAT THEY WOULD ONLY HONOR THE RECALL OF IOTA TRANSFER SWITCHES INSTALLED BY MONACO WHILE THE COMPANY WAS OWNED BY NAVISTAR.  MY COACH WAS BUILT BY MONACO COACH CORP. IN LATE 2008.  THEY ALSO INDICATED TO ME THAT IOTA HAD DISAVOWED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE INCURRED BY THE \"DEFECTIVE\" TRANSFER SWITCHES.  I HAVE DISCONNECTED THE SHORE POWER FOR MY MOTOR HOME AS I DO NOT WANT TO RISK ANOTHER FIRE AND POSSIBLE TOTAL LOSS OF MY COACH AND ITS CONTENTS.  THE ONLY WAS I CAN HAVE 110 AC POWER IS TO RUN THE ONBOARD GENERATOR AND I AM RELUCTANT TO DO THAT AS THE POWER STILL GOES THROUGH THE TRANSFER SWITCH.  ANY ASSISTANCE THAT CAN BE RENDERED IN REPAIRING THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT WILL BE APPRECIATED.",
