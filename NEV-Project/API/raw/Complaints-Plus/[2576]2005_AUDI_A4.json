THIS CONDITION IS BOTH UNSAFE, AND ILLEGAL - AS MANY STATES WILL ISSUE A TRAFFIC VIOLATION FOR DRIVING WITH A NON-FUNCTIONING HEADLIGHT. IT HAS HAPPENED ABOUT 7-8 TIMES, THE HEADLIGHT FLICKERS, THEN GOES OUT, BUT WILL COME BACK ON WHEN THE CAR IS RESTARTED, THEN BE FINE FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS AT A TIME. THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM ON AT LEAST 3 VISITS, AND HAS CLAIMED THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE AND THEY CAN NOT REPRODUCE SAID ERROR. THEY HAVE SUGGESTED/GUESSED THAT IT IS THE XENON LIGHT BULB ITSELF, HOWEVER IT HAS CHECKED OUT FINE EACH TIME, AND AS MENTIONED, HAS FUNCTIONED FLAWLESSLY AFTER EACH OCCURRENCE WITH MERELY A RESTART OF THE VEHICLE. NO PARTS HAVE BEEN REPAIRED OR REPLACED, HOWEVER THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO PERFORM A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS ON AT LEAST ONE VISIT. GIVEN THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION ONLINE AND BY WORD OF MOUTH FROM OTHER FELLOW AUDI OWNERS, THIS PROBLEM IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST MY CASE.

CHANGING THE ENTIRE LOCKS FOR THE CAR AT $1,500 WAS THE RECOMMENDED SOLUTION.  NOW THE CARE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WHEN IT WAS WITHIN THE 50K WARRANTY PERIOD.  I CHECKED ON GOOGLE.  WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR \"LOCKED-OUT AUDI\"  YOU SEE NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF LOCK MALFUNCTION.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND SHOULD BE FIXED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MILEAGE ON THE CAR.

THAT TIRE GOT REPLACED IMMEDIATELY.  THE ASSISTANT MANAGER AT BIG O, JAMES, TOLD ME \"IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME\", AND \"PROBABLY FROM RUBBING AGAINST CURBS\".  HE THOUGHT THE ONE THAT JUST HAD SURFACE CRACKING AROUND AND NO DAMAGE TO THE CORDS WAS OKAY TO NOT REPLACE \"SHOULD BE FINE\".      ONE AND A HALF MONTHS AND ONE FREEWAY BLOWOUT LATER, IT'S OBVIOUS THE TIRES WERE ALL BAD FOR SOME REASON.  THE BACK TWO: ONE NOW SHOWING SAME SIDEWALL CRACKS AND THE OTHER ONE BLEW OUT.  FRONT ONE NOT REPLACED IS MORE PRONOUNCED.  THE BLOWOUT HAD THE TREAD FULLY SEPARATED FROM THE SIDEWALL.  JAMES, WHEN I CAME BACK TO FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT THESE CLEARLY DEFECTIVE TIRES, SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME TRYING TO REFUTE THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND EVEN TRIED TO ARGUE THAT THEY WERE THE WRONG TIRE FOR THE CAR (A STUPID ARGUMENT FOR MULTIPLE REASONS, INCLUDING THAT THEY SOLD THEM TO ME AND THAT THEIR WEBSITE STILL RECOMMENDS IT FOR MY CAR....HE CALLS TO THEIR \"TECH CENTER\" TO PROVE HIS POINT, ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS WRONG...WHAT A WASTE OF TIME).  NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE WAS NO MENTION OR CONCERN ABOUT MY FAMILY'S SAFETY; A BUSINESS THAT SHOULD MAKE CUSTOMER SAFETY THE #1 PRIORITY SHOULD AT LEAST SAY SOMETHING LIKE \"WAS EVERYONE OKAY\", OR \"I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU HAD SOMETHING SO BAD HAPPEN\".  INSTEAD IT WAS JUST JAMES TRYING TO FIND WAYS OF BRUSHING IT OFF, JUST LIKE HE DID A MONTH AND A HALF EARLIER, WHEN A FRIGHTENING FREEWAY BLOWOUT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED PERHAPS IF SOMEONE WHO BOTH KNEW TIRES AND CARED ABOUT A CUSTOMERS SAFETY HAD CHECKED THEM OUT INSTEAD OF THESE DANGEROUS CROOKS.

FORD (AUDI REP) AUTHORIZED MC KENNA TO CHANGE THE CAMBER ON THE VEHICLE TO IT CAN DRIVE STRAIGHT. THIS CAUSED MY TIRE TO WEAR OUT AT AN ALARMING RATE. THIS QUICK FIX WAS APPARENTLY TO KEEP ME FROM GOING BACK. I CHANGED THE TIRES AND HAD THE CAR RE ALIGNED TO MANUFACTURES SPECIFICATIONS.  THE CAR DANGEROUSLY DRIFTS TO THE RIGHT IF I DON'T COUNTER STEER TO THE LEFT.  MC KENNA AUDI STATED THEY CAN NO LONGER DO ANYTHING FOR THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. I PAID $250.00 FOR THE ALIGNMENT AND IT WAS MONEY LOST.  MC KENNA WILL NOT REFUND OR FIX THE WARRANTIED CAR ANYMORE.  THEY ADVISED ME TO CONTACT AUDI OF AMERICA FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE. AUDI HAS NOT RESPONDED.  *NM",
