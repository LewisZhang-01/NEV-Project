THIS SITUATION IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN A SITUATION WHERE THE EXTERIOR LAMPS ARE NOT WORKING.

THE SYMPTOMS ARE INTERMITTENT, BUT NOT LINKED TO STEERING WHEEL POSITION OR THE MOTION OF THE VEHICLE.  THERE MIGHT BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND THE ERROR - IT HAS NOT OCCURRED IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF DROUGHT AFTER IT BEGAN ON 8/31 UNTIL WE HAD EXPERIENCED A WEEK OF RAIN.    BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE SWITCH, THE DEFECT IS QUITE COSTLY TO REPAIR, REQUIRING THE STEERING COLUMN TO BE BREACHED.

FROM THE RESPONSES WE GOT FROM        OUR MECHANICS AND CHRYSLER, IT IS OBVIOUS TO US THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TRUCK THAT CAME IN WITH THE VERY SAME PROBLEM.  THE TIE ROD ENDS FAILING IS NOT THE SAME AS THE HEATER OR AIR CONDITIONER QUITTING.   IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, AND WE GOT NO SATISFACTION AND WERE TREATED AS THOUGH IT WAS SOME IRRITATION THAT THEY WERE BOTHERED WITH.  WE BELIEVE THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, AND THEIR (CUSTOMER SERVICE) KNOW ABOUT IT AND ONLY WANTED TO GET US OFF THEIR BACK BY GIVING US THE LOWEST POSSIBLE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  LIKE MOST GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, THEY WOULD NOT COMMIT ANY OF THEIR COMMENTS TO WRITING, BUT, I AM SURE, RECORDED EVERYTHING, WHERE IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. *TR",
