FOUR NEW YOKOHAMA GEOLANDER A/T-S 31X10.50 R15 LT 109S 6PR WERE INSTALLED LAST SUMMER BY OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER (FREEMAN TOYOTA SANTA ROSA, CA).  VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN ANOTHER SHOP SINCE THEN HAVING PRE-RESTORATION WORK DONE.  TIRES HAVE NO MORE THAN 300-400 NORMAL ROAD MILES ON THEM.   I PICKED IT UP DEC. 26, 2016 TO BRING HOME, A ROAD TRIP OF 50 MILES.  TEN MINUTES AFTER PARKING THE LEFT REAR TIRE EXPLODED.  FAILURE WAS CATASTROPHIC AT THE BEAD.  BEAD REMAINS IN PLACE ON RIM, TIRE IS BLOWN OFF OF BEAD AND SPLIT (SEE PHOTOS).  I IMMEDIATELY FELT RIM AND BRAKE DRUM FOR HEAT AND FOUND ONLY NORMAL WARMTH AFTER A TRIP.  I CHECKED PRESSURE OF THREE REMAINING TIRES AND READ 50 PSI, PROPER SPEC AT RATED MAX LOAD.  THERE IS AN INTERESTING SCUFF MARK THAT I CAN'T DECIPHER IN IMAGES 11898 AND 11899.  IT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY DOWN ON TO THE BEAD AREA WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HIDDEN FROM ANY ROAD HAZARDS BEFORE IT BLEW.  I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE CONTACTED ANYTHING WHEN IT BLEW.  *TR",
