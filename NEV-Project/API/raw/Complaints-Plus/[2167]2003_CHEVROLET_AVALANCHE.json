ADJUSTMENTS TO THE  DRIVER'S SEAT IS NOT THE ISSUE I'VE TRIED SEVERAL ITERATIONS WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS. IT'S THAT HUGE CHUNK OF METAL THAT I'M FORCED TO SIT ON THAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM.

I DROVE MANY MILES FOR WORK AND FOR TRANSPORTING HOCKEY KIDS TO PRACTICE, GAMES, TOURNAMENTS, ETC.

I CONTACTED MY GM DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT A 'SILENT RECALL' HAD BEEN ISSUED TO DEALERS STATING THAT IF A VEHICLE WITH LESS THAN 3 YEARS AND UNDER 70,000 MILES WAS BROUGHT IN, THE DEALER SHOULD FIX THE ITEM AS A WARRANTY REPAIR.  SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS 2 MOS OVER THE 3 YR AND OVER THE 70,000 MILES, I WAS DENIED A WARRANTY REPAIR AND QUOTED $700.00 TO FIX THE PART.  SINCE THAT DATE, MY SON'S CHEVROLET VEHICLE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!  AND, IN 2009 A FRIEND'S BRAND NEW DENALI WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.

I DROVE FOR MORE THAN 20 MILES THIS WAY, TO MY MECHANIC IN WEST CHESTER, ON SEVERAL ROADS WITH HEAVY TRAFFIC AND MANY STOP LIGHTS. I DID THIS BY SHIFTING GEARS AND BY TURNING THE ENGINE OFF AND ON. MY MECHANIC HAD TO FABRICATE SOME PARTS TO REPLACE THE BRAKE LINES, SINCE THESE PARTS ARE NO LONGER MADE BY GM. HE COMPLETELY REPLACED BOTH BRAKES. I PAID $394.  I HAVE LEARNED ONLINE THAT SOME 110 OWNERS OF CERTAIN GM TRUCKS AND SUVS, INCLUDING THE MODEL I OWN, HAVE REPORTED THEIR VEHICLES TO THE NHTSA FOR BRAKE DEFECTS, AND THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION THAT BEGAN IN SPRING 2010. I WANT TO ADD MY COMPLAINT TO THOSE OTHERS. I THINK GM DID A SHODDY JOB MANUFACTURING THE BRAKES FOR MY 2003 AVALANCHE. IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO GET COMPENSATION FOR THIS, I AM INTERESTED.

THERE IS A SPRING-CLIP THAT RETAINS THE EMERGENCY BRAKE SHOE.  THIS SPRING-CLIP (ON THE DRIVER-SIDE, REAR WHEEL) CAME APART, ALLOWING THE E-BRAKE SHOE TO COME LOOSE.  THIS HAD 2 RESULTS:  1) THE E-BRAKE SHOE FELL OUT OF POSITION, WEDGED ITSELF SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF THE DRUM, AND THEN THE BRAKE-SHOE & DRUM GROUND AGAINST EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED AND/OR DESTROYED, 2) THE ENTIRE EMERGENCY-BRAKE SYSTEM WAS RENDERED COMPLETELY USELESS.    3.  THE DAMAGE FROM THE FAILURE CAN BE REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE SHOE, BRAKE ROTOR AND SPRING-CLIP.  (I WILL PRO-ACTIVELY REPLACE THE SPRING-CLIP ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHICH HAS NOT YET FAILED).  THE OLD PARTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS SPRING-CLIP HAS BEEN REDESIGNED OR NOT.  *TR",

I CALLED THE CHEVROLET COMPANY AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE IT WAS OVER 100,000 MILES BUT ITS THERE PROBLEM THEY ARE THE ONES THAT GLUED THE HINGES TO THE GLASS AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY 900.00 DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE GLASS ESPECIALLY WHEN I DON'T HAVE IT. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM I KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE MAKE THE CHEVROLET COMPANY FIX THIS PROBLEM. IT HAS CAUSED THE BACK GLASS TO STICK UP OVER THE BACK ABOUT A INCH AND YOU CAN NOT EVEN OPEN IT BECAUSE THE HINGE ON THE GLASS HAS COME COMPLETELY UNGLUED IT  FALLS DOWN WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND IS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE ONCE YOU OPEN IT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PICK UP ON THE GLASS AND TRY TO CLOSE IT AT THE SAME TIME BELIEVE ME MY FINGERS HAS GOTTEN SMASHED MANY TIMES SO I STOPPED EVEN OPENING IT. BUT BEFORE THIS HAPPENED I REALLY USED IT ALOT TO PUT STUFF IN THE BACK WHEN THE 3RD ROW SEAT WAS BEING USED IF YOU OPENED THE WHOLE DOOR THEN YOUR STUFF FALLS OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM TO PUT YOUR STUFF BACK THERE.  *TR",

MY CHEVROLET TAHOE HAS BOTH THESE ISSUES.  THEY STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE LETTER.

I TRAVEL THROUGH A LOT OF RURAL AREAS TO WORK AND I FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT RUN OUT OF GAS.  I FEEL IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  THE SPEEDOMETER REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING 60 OR 70 MILES PER HOUR WHEN I AM SITTING AT A RED LIGHT.  WHEN I AM GOING DOWN THE ROAD IT REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING OVER 120 MILES PER HOUR.

THE WORST OF THESE PROBLEMS HAS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON THE NORTHEAST EXTENSION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE LEFT LANE THE ENGINE \"SHUT OFF\". I WAS DOING APPROX. 60-65 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED DURING THE AM RUSH HOUR. AFTER LOSING ENGINE POWER I SOMEHOW MADE IT SAFELY TO THE RIGHT HAND SHOULDER AND LET THE TRUCK \"COAST\" TO A STOP. THE POWER STEERING WAS NOT WORKING, NOR WERE THE POWER BRAKES. AFTER FINALLY STOPPING, THE TRUCK DID RESTART AND I SLOWLY CONTINUED ON MY WAY TO WORK. THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO A DEALERSHIP, AND FOR ALMOST (2) WEEKS THE TRUCK SAT THERE WHILE THEY TRIED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AFTER GETTING THE TRUCK BACK, THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED, AND IT WENT BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP. SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN OK, EXCEPT I HAVE LOST DASHBOARD LIGHTS, RADIO LIGHTS, AND ALSO THE CRUISE CONTROL INDICATOR LIGHT, THEY CLAIM OTHER PROBLEMS, HOWEVER THESE ISSUES WERE NEVER A PROBLEM BEFORE THEY WORKED ON THE TRUCK. NOW I HAVE AIR-BAG LIGHTS FLASH AT ME WHILE DRIVING, AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING, THIS WAS THE FIRST PROBLEM WITH THE TRUCK THAT I REPORTED ON 03/14/2007 TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK FROM. I HAVE ALREADY PAID OVER $1500.00 I REPAIR COSTS, ONLY TO HAVE THEM TELL ME IT WILL COST APPROX. ANOTHER $800.00-$1000.00 TO CORRECT THE AIR-BAG, AND TRANSMISSION ISSUES. THESE SHOULD BE COVERED BY MY WARRANTY, EXCEPT THE DEALERSHIP INSISTS I PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I HAVE PAID ENOUGH, AND I AM AT MY WIT'S END WITH THIS TRUCK, AND THE DEALERSHIP. I FEEL THAT I CAN NO LONGER \"SAFELY\" DRIVE MY FAMILY AROUND IN THIS TRUCK, AND I STILL HAVE MANY YEARS OF PAYMENTS LEFT. ( I HAVE NEVER BEEN LATE ON A PAYMENT) PLEASE HELP ME, I FEEL AS THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SOLD A \"MONEY PIT\".  *TR",
