He reset the codes and serviced the oil. I was due for a formal recheck about now, a 1000 miles later.

As evidenced in Attachment 1, this caused damage to the Antilock Braking System due to loss of vacuum on the system and possible fouling due to foreign object damage to the vehicle ABS. Later assessment by trained mechanics determined the root cause was due to insufficient structural capability of engine pistons to withstand brief periods of LSPI.   As evidenced by attachment 18-NA-171 and PIP5490, the vehicle manufacturer (General Motors) is aware of the insufficient design of the pistons, has re-designed them to withstand LSPI, however has not made an effort to notify me or  replace the existing part to prevent damage to the vehicle powertrain and ABS. While this particular instance of piston cracking due to LSPI has only had a financial impact on myself, loss of ABS functionality and potential engine seizure at highway speeds have the potential to produce dangerous, if not fatal, conditions to other drivers with similar hardware.",

FIRST EVENT -- HEAVY TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC AHEAD SLOWING FOR TRANSITION RAMP CURVE, SLIGHT UPHILL CURVE.  IF THROTTLE WAS APPLIED, IT WAS VERY LIGHT TO STOP DECELERATION AND MATCH SPEED OF TRAFFIC AHEAD.  SLOWING ON DOWNSHIFT WAS ENOUGH TO CAUSE VEHICLE BEHIND ME TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION (BRAKE AND QUICKLY CHANGE LANES).    SECOND OCCURRENCE, MINIMAL TRAFFIC, LEVEL, STRAIGHT 2-LANE FREEWAY, COASTING TO WAIT FOR TRUCK PASSING ANOTHER TRUCK.  WHEN LANE CLEARED, APPLIED SIGNIFICANT THROTTLE.

I WAS TOO DISTRACTED BY THE EVENTS TO LOOK AT TACHOMETER, BUT I SUSPECT ENGINE AUTOSTOP ENGAGED DURING THE COASTING AND DOWNSHIFT WAS RELATED TO RESTART OF ENGINE.
