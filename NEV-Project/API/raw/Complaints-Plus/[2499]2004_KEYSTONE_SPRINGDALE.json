HE HAD NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE, BUT AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE FAILURE, HE DISCOVERED THERE WAS A RECALL.  HE CALLED DOMETIC SINCE HE DID NOT RECEIVE A RECALL NOTICE.  DOMETIC CONFIRMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR AND THEY STATED THAT THEY WOULD ONLY INSTALL A HEAT SHIELD TO PREVENT A FIRE.  THE REFRIGERATOR WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE THERE WAS A FRACTURE IN THE BOILER TUBE AND HE NEEDED IT REPLACED IF HE WISH TO USE THE REFRIGERATOR.  DOMETIC STATED THAT THEY WOULD SELL THE CONTACT A REPLACEMENT UNIT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE.  THE TRAILER HAD NO FURTHER INFORMATION.  UPDATED 09/13/08.  *LJ  UPDATED 09/17/08. *JB",
