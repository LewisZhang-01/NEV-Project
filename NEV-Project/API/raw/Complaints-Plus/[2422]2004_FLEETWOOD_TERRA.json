        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A 2004 FLEETWOOD TERRA RV. IN JULY OF 2004. DURING THE TEST DRIVE WE DISCOVERED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DIFFICULT HANDLING AND DRIVING. IT HANDLED LIKE A 40'S OR 50'S TRUCK.  THE FRONT END SEEMED VERY LOOSE AND THE VEHICLE WOULD FLY ALL OVER THE ROAD.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BUT WE DID POST A COMPLAINT TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT SOLD US THE VEHICLE AND THEY ASSURED US THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE ADDRESSED.  WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND WHEN WE ASK IF THEY HAD WORKED ON THE FRONT END THEY ASSURED US THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOW IN GREAT RUNNING SHAPE. WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN DENVER, COLORADO BUT WE LIVED IN GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO.  GRAND JUNCTION IS A LITTLE LESS THAN 300 MILES FROM DENVER.  I MUST TELL YOU THAT WE HAD A REAL EXPERIENCE DRIVING THIS NEW RV OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN COLORADO. I HAD DRIVEN A COUPLE OF RV'S BEFORE AND I HAD NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS DRIVING THEM -- HOWEVER, AFTER DRIVING THIS NEW VEHICLE FOR NO MORE THAN 40 MILES AND FIGHTING TO KEEP IT ON THE HIGHWAY I SIMPLY GAVE UP. I WAS BEAT AND MY NERVES WERE SHOT. I TELL YOU I WILL NEVER DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN.  ANYWAY, WHEN WE GOT TO GRAND JUNCTION WE WENT TO THE LOCAL FLEETWOOD DEALERSHIP AND WE WERE REFUSED ANY WORK ON THE VEHICLE.  WE CALLED FLEETWOOD, WHO CALLED THEIR DEALER AND THE DEALER STILL WOULD NOT WORK ON THE VEHICLE.    WE LET THE VEHICLE SIT IN STORAGE FOR THREE MONTHS AND THEN WE DROVE IT TO ARIZONA. AGAIN, THE DEALERSHIP IN ARIZONA REFUSED TO DO ANY WORK ON THE VEHICLE.  AGAIN, FLEETWOOD CALLED THEM AND THIS TIME THEY DID DO SOME WORK.  WE ALSO, GOT A LOCAL CHEV. DEALER TO WORK ON THE FRONT END.  HOWEVER, WHATEVER WORK THEY SEEM TO DO THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AFTER THE WORK IS COMPLETED.  WE FEEL THAT THE VEHICLE IS A REAL ROAD HAZARD AND THAT THE WAY IT HANDLES PUTS US AND ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD WHEN WE ARE DRIVING IN HARMS WAY.  WE FEEL THAT THIS VEHICLE IS A REAL LEMON AND WILL NEVER HANDLE OF DRIVE WITHIN SAFETY STANDARDS AND SAFETY REGULATIONS.  *JB",
