AFTER SPEAKING TO QUITE A FEW MECHANICS, I WAS TOLD THAT THE DODGES THAT HAVE THE 3.3 LITER ENGINES IN THEM HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS.  THE MECHANICS STATED THAT HAVE HAD A LOT OF DODGES THAT THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN AND THE DODGE IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE OWED 2 OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE NOT DODGES AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE A TRANSMISSION AT ALL AND THEY ARE OLDER THAN MY VAN.  I HAD TO PURCHASE MY VAN, SO I COULD PUT MY HUSBAND'S WHEELCHAIR IN IT.  IT IS EASIER TO GET IT IN AND OUT OF THE VAN.  I AM ON A FIXED INCOME DUE TO MY HUSBAND BEING DISABLED AND WE HAVE SON IN SCHOOL.  SO MONEY IS VERY TIGHT.  I WAS LUCKY I QUALIFIED FOR THE LOAN TO GET A NEW TRANSMISSION, OR I WOULD BE UNABLE TO TRANSPORT MY HUSBAND BACK AND FORTH TO DOCTOR APPTS AND SHOPPING.  I HAVE SPOKE WITH OTHER DODGE OWNERS WHO HAVE ALL TOLD ME THEY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN THEIR DODGE 3.3 LITER VEHICLES.  BUT WHAT GETS ME IS THAT ALL THE TRANSMISSION EXPERTS THAT I SPOKE WITH SAID, THEY CHANGE AT LEAST 2 -3 TRANSMISSION A WEEK IN THESE DODGES.  AND THAT DODGE IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DODGE DOESN'T MIND FIXING THE SMALL PROBLEMS, BUT OVER LOOK THAT FACT THAT THEY HAVE A DEFECT THAT CAUSING A TRANSMISSION TO GO OUT AND IT COSTING THE BUYER AT A MINIMUM OF $2000 TO REPLACE.  THIS HAS TO BE STOPPED AND DODGE MADE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUR COST.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLASS ACTION SUIT BROUGHT AGAINST THEM FOR THIS.  ONE GUY I WORK WITH HAD HIS BRAND NEW DODGE TRUCK LEAVE HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AND HE HAD ONLY 57,800 MILES ON IT.  DODGE KNOWS THEY PUT OUT A DEFECT TRANSMISSION, BUT THEY ARE MAKING THE CONSUMER PAY FOR IT.  THIS IS WRONG AND THEY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  *JB",

A WEEK AGO FRIDAY I HAD A TIRE BLOWOUT THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE THAT I HAVE NEEDED TO CHANGE A FLAT TO MY SPARE TIRE AND ALSO USE THE SCISSOR JACK THAT THE FACTORY SUPPLIED WITH MY VEHICLE. I WAS USING YOUR FACTORY SUPPLIED JACK TO RAISE THE VEHICLE WHEN THE JACK APPARENTLY SLIPPED AND THE VEHICLE FELL TO THE GROUND. I PROCEEDED TO EXTRICATE THE JACK AND LOOKED IT OVER AND IT APPEARED TO BE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE WITH NO INDICATIONS OF ANY DAMAGE; I CONCLUDED THAT THE JACK SOMEHOW SLIPPED.  I AGAIN INSERTED THE JACK UNDER THE VEHICLE AND PROCEEDED TO AGAIN JACK UP THE VEHICLE WHEN THE JACK COLLAPSED AGAIN. UPON GATHERING UP MY THINGS I NOTED THAT THE JACK DID NOT SLIP, BUT FAILED AND THAT CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO FALL TO THE GROUND.  THE JACK FAILURE WAS IN THE UPPER INSIDE SUPPORT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND INSERT THE SCISSOR JACK UNDER THE VEHICLE WHEN THE SCISSOR JACK LIFTS THE JACK UP.  I SHOWED THE FAILED JACK TO A WELDER FRIEND OF MINE WHO KNOWS ABOUT METALS, AND HE STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS METAL FATIGUE AND THAT THAT PART OF THE JACK WAS NOT PROPERLY MANUFACTURED BECAUSE THE METAL WAS NOT CURED AND HARDENED  PROPERLY TO ACQUIRE ITS NEEDED STRENGTH.  FIRST I EXPECT A NEW REPLACEMENT JACK THAT WILL FIT INTO THE STORAGE COMPARTMENT MADE FOR IT SO THAT I WILL HAVE A FACTORY JACK WHENEVER I DECIDE TO GET A NEW VEHICLE AND THE PERSON WHO BUYS MY VEHICLE NEXT WILL HAVE A GOOD, SAFE, FACTORY JACK WHENEVER NEEDED.  SECOND I EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED THE $20.00 I GAVE THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER WHO HELPED ME OUT WHEN THE SCISSOR JACK FAILED AND BECAME BROKEN AND USELESS. THIRD, IT WOULD BE NICE BUT NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME, IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER SOME FAIR COMPENSATION FOR MY BEING LATE, TIRED, DIRTY, SMELLY AND ANGRY WHEN I WAS MEETING MY WIFE FOR DINNER.

I HAVE REPLACED 8 TIRES (IN 30000 MILES!), BOTH FRONT AXLES, ALL THREE MOTOR MOUNTS, AND HAD THE TRANSMISSION OVERHAULED, AS WELL AS HAVING THREE ALIGNMENT CHECKS.  THE VIBRATION IS STILL THERE.  THE SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  THE FRONT WIPERS WERE, FOR A TIME, COMING ON ANY TIME THEY FELT LIKE IT; THIS WAS REMEDIED BY REPLACING THE MULTI FUNCTION SWITCH ON 09/21/01.  SINCE THEN, THE REAR WIPER WILL OCCASIONALLY COME ON FOR ONE SWIPE WHEN I FIRST START THE VEHICLE - ANNOYING, BUT NOT AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD.  BUT TODAY, MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS QUIT WORKING AT ALL.  THEY WILL ONLY WORK IF I PUT THE WIPERS ON INTERVAL - IN WHICH CASE THEY DO NOTHING FOR A TIME, THEN MAKE TWO TO FOUR SWIPES, THEN WAIT A WHILE, MAKE ONE OR TWO SWIPES, WAIT A WHILE, ETC.  THEY WILL MAKE ONE HIGH SPEED SWIPE ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD IF I PRESS THE WASHER BUTTON IN.  I SPENT $80 TODAY SO THE DODGE DEALER COULD TELL ME THIS WAS CAUSED BY A BODY CONTROL MODULE FAILURE.  THIS REPAIR COSTS OVER $400...AND RESEARCHING A USED PART ONLINE, I LEARNED THAT BOTH THE WHEEL SHIMMY PROBLEM AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPER PROBLEMS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO MY CAR BUT ARE VERY COMMON ISSUES WITH THE DODGE CARAVAN/CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY/PLYMOUTH VOYAGER FAMILY.  LOSING YOUR WIPERS, HAVING THEM COME ON AT RANDOM WHEN THEY TAKE A NOTION TO, AND A NON-STOP SHIMMY IN THE FRONT ARE EACH, BY THEMSELVES, SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES WARRANTING A RECALL.  COLLECTIVELY, THEY SPELL OUT A LACK OF CONCERN THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO DRIVE THEIR PRODUCTS.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY ONLINE RESEARCH THAT CHRYSLER WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS LONG AGO AS 1998 BUT DELIBERATELY IGNORED ITS OWN INFORMATION.  IT IS APPARENT THAT THE ONLY WAY THESE SAFETY ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES THEM TO TASK.*AK",

A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON STEADILY AND THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VAN AT THAT TIME EITHER . THE *CODE* THEY FOUND SAID *OXYGEN SENSOR* BUT THEY RESET IT  .

WE HAD TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE EMERGENCY LANE AND WAIT UNTIL A TOW TRUCK COULD TOW US BACK TO LEXINGTON ...

I CONTACTED THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, HE SAID THAT HE HAS CERTAINLY SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE, BUT SINCE IT OCCURED OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY, I AM ON MY OWN.  THE MINIVAN HAS BEEN REPAIRED, BUT SINCE THE REPLACEMENT DIFFERENTIAL IS THE SAME AS BEFORE, A SERIOUS DEFECT STILL EXISTS IN MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE RETAINED THE WORN/BROKEN DIFFERENTIAL UNIT IN CASE DODGE ENGINEERS WANT TO INSPECT IT.",

HE SAID BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE AND THAT I WASN'T THE ORIGINAL OWNER DODGE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR US. HE ALSO SAID IT WOULD COST $2000.00 PER SIDE TO FIX AND THE VAN WASN'T WORTH IT. I SAID THIS IS A SERIOUS THING AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED BY CHRYSLER BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY USED INFERIOR MATERIALS ON THAT PART OF THE VAN. HE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT, AND THE WEATHER WHERE WE LIVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. I SAID SO I AM JUST OUT OF A VEHICLE TO DRIVE?, AND HE SAID YOU CAN DRIVE IT BUT IT'S NOT SAFE. NOW THE OTHER MAN TOLD MY WIFE THAT IF SHE HIT A HOLE OR WENT OVER RR TRACKS IT COULD COME COMPLETELY THROUGH AND SHE WOULD LOSE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE AUTO BODY MAN WE TOOK IT TO SAID THAT THE PART SHOULD HAVE BEEN GALVANIZED WHEN THEY MADE IT AND THIS WOULDN'T BE HAPPENING.

IN RESEARCHING ON VARIOUS WEB SITES, THIS SEEMS TO BE A RECURRING PROBLEM FOR OTHER OWNERS AS WELL.  THE DEALER HAS KEPT THE CAR TWICE SO THEY COULD 'DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM', THEY REPLACE ONE SENSOR OR ANOTHER.  LAST REPLACEMENT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED BUT STILL DON'T TRUST THE CAR AND WON'T DRIVE ON FREEWAY OR FAR FROM HOME. NOW HAVE TROUBLE STARTING THE CAR, THE DEALER SAID IT'S PROBABLY THE CRANK SENSOR. THEY SAY SINCE I ONLY HAVE 33,000 MILES ON THE CAR, IT SHOULDN'T BE THE STARTER.  ALSO, I HAVE HISTORY OF THE WIPERS TURNING ON AND OFF WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT. THEY ALSO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN RHYTHM WHEN WORKING.  THE WIPER SENSOR HAS BEEN REPLACED 3 TIMES.  THE COMPUTER NEVER SHOWS AN ERROR CODE SO OBVIOUSLY, IT ISN'T WORKING EITHER.  THE SPEEDOMETER WILL FLOAT AND SOMETIMES WILL SHOW 0 MILES AN HOUR WHEN I'M MOVING.  THEY REPLACED THE SPEEDOMETER SENSOR TWICE AND NOW IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.    I HAVE SEEN ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS LISTED ON VARIOUS WEB SITES.  THE DEALER ACTS LIKE I'M CRAZY AND THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE.    MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE SUDDEN LACK OF POWER, THE ENGINE JUST TURNS OFF, NO POWER STEERING  EITHER WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  I WONDER HOW MANY ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN A RESULT OF THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT... AS SOON AS I CAN AFFORD IT, I WILL BE REPLACING THIS VAN WITH A NON-DODGE VEHICLE.   *NLM",

MY HUSBAND WAS TRAVELING ON I-40 BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF WINSTON SALEM, NC, WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  HE HAD WITH HIM OUR 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MY STEP-DAUGHTER, THEY WERE STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR OVER 4 HOURS, AND AT NIGHT.  WE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD A \"PIN\" OF SOME SORT IN THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED AND THE VAN SEEMED TO BE FINE AFTER THAT; WE HAD NO OTHER INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM--THE VAN'S TRANSMISSION WENT OUT WITHOUT ANY INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  THIS HAPPENED ON A VERY BUSY PART OF THE INTERSTATE; IT JUST SHUT DOWN AND COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IF THEY HAD BEEN TRAVELING IN THE LEFT LANE OF TRAFFIC.  DUE TO BEING IN THE RIGHT LANE, THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT BEING HIT BY OTHER TRAFFIC.  WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE THE VAN TOWED OVER 60 MILES TO GET IT HOME.

I TOOK MY VAN TO A MECHANIC WHO CHECKED FUSES= OK; PROBLEM IS \"AIRBAG CLOCKSPRING.\"   HE CONTACTED 3 OTHER MECHANICS AND A DODGE DEALER, AND ALL SAID THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM WITH DODGE CARAVAN, AND  THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE AIRBAG CLOCKSPRING.  THE MECHANIC EXPLAINED  THE CLOCKSPRING NEEDS TO BE RESET, BUT HE AND OTHER MECHANICS WON'T ATTEMPT TO FIX, AS THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT DEPLOYING AIRBAG.  THE 2 DEALERS SAID  THE AIRBAG MAY  DEPLOY ON ITS OWN, OR NOT DEPLOY AT ALL -- AND THAT  REPAIR INVOLVES REPLACING THE AIRBAG CLOCKSPRING.  I'M UPSET AND WANT CHRYSLER TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR -- THIS IS NOT A MAINTENANCE ITEM/ISSUE -- THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE -- WHEN THE AIRBAG LIGHT COMES ON, INDICATING  FAILURE (CLOCKSPRING), THE HORN ALSO IS DISABLED.

IN MARCH WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM THE PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN HAVING ON TOP OF OTHER ISSUES. WE ONLY HAD THIS MINI VAN FOR A YEAR AND WE ALREADY HAD TO REPAIR THE AIR CONDITIONER 2X , FUEL PUMP BECAUSE IT WAS LEAKING, THE FIRST TIME THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROMBEM AND SAID IT WAS AN OVERFILL OF GAS, SECOND TIME THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM AND FIXED IT. ALSO OUT OF POCKET  FOR BRAKES, AND ROTOR.  WE WERE HOPING FOR SOME KIND OF EXCHANGE FOR THIS.  DURING THE YEAR WE HAD THIS MINI VAN THE DEALERSHIP CHANGE HANDS AGAIN. NOW THE CURRENT OWNER IS GETTING COMPLAINTS FROM CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM THERE LAST YEAR, PER OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE SALES MANAGER. THEY HAD TO RE-RUN OUR CREDIT AND TAKE ALL OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ALL OVER AGAIN.  NEXT MORNING I WAS TOLD THAT THE BANK /LENDER WANTS $2500.00  UPFRONT AS GOOD FAITH, BECAUSE WE STILL OWE ON THE VEHICLE. LIKE I SAID EARLIER THE CAR IS FINACE FOR 5 YEARS.   ALSO THE PART THAT IS NEEDED COST ANYWHERE BETWEEN $385 TO 209 APPROX. AND LABOR $300.00 OR SO. SO WE WOULD BE PAYING CLOSE TO $685 OR MORE.

HE SAID THERE IS ANOTHER ROLLOVER VALVE ON THIS VEHICLE THAT WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL, BUT THAT THIS IS A DIFFERENT ROLLOVER VALVE.  I CONTACTED TWO PERSONS AT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE (USING THE NUMBER THAT BOB LELAND GAVE ME). BOTH PERSON, RYAN AND JULE AT 800 992 1997 INDICATED THAT THE PART WAS NOT SUBJECT TO RECALL, WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR REPAIR--OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXPENSE OF REPAIR.  I WAS TOLD BY BOB LELAND THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD REASON FOR THE ROLLOVER VALVE TO CRACK, I.E. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAUMA TO VEHICLE OR ANY INDICATIONS OF AN ACCIDENT. I HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED BY RENTON CHRYSLER BEFORE I PURCHASED IT FROM THE ORIGNAL OWNER, AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN IN A WRECK.  I HAVE HAD NO WRECKS SINCE OWNING THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A GOODYEAR SERVICE CENTER IN TOWN (NEW CONCEPTS AUTO AT 509.747.2164).  THEY PULLED UP THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN, SHOWING NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL TANK, ROLLOVER VALVE, AND FUEL LINES. THEY WERE UNSURE WHETHER THE TSB REFERRED SPECIFICALLY TO THE TOP VALVE.  BECAUSE THEY HAD A LOWER ESTIMATE TO REPAIR ($720 INCLUDING TAX), I GAVE THEM THE GO AHEAD TO REPAIR TODAY.  I CANNOT DRIVE THE VAN WITH A FUEL LEAK, ESPECIALLY WITH MY INFANT AND TODDLER IUSING CAR SEATS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS HAZARD, AND I BELIEVE THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIR. I HAVE INSTRUCTED THE GOODYEAR SHOP TO INSPECT FOR ANY TRAUMA TO THE TANK AND CAR, AND I AM SURE THEY WILL FIND NONE. I WILL ALSO HAVE THEM KEEP THE TANK SO THAT IT CAN BE INSPECTED ASAP.

IT WENT OFF AFTER 5 MINUTES.  THE PATTERN OF THE AIRBAG COMING ON STARTED OCCURRING MORE REGULARLY AND STAYING ON LONGER.  WE TOOK THE MINIVAN INTO KOON'S DODGE (FALLS CHURCH, VA) ON SATURDAY, JULY 14, 2001.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A PROBLEM WITH THE CLOCK-SPRING IN THE STEERING COLUMN THAT HAD GONE BAD AND HAD MADE THE AIRBAG GO BAD.  THEY GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $800 TO FIX IT.  I ASKED THEM WHETHER DODGE WOULD PAY FOR IT SINCE HAVING AN AIRBAG GO BAD SHOULD NOT BE AN ORDINARY \"WEAR AND TEAR\" ITEM FOR ANY AUTOMOBILE.  THE ASSISTANT MANAGER (SCOTT) TOLD ME THAT HIS BOSS (RAY RASADO) WOULD HAVE TO TALK WITH DODGE ON MONDAY, 7/16/2001 TO SEE IF THEY WOULD PAY FOR IT.  I CALLED BACK ON MONDAY AND THEY SAID THAT DODGE REFUSED TO PAY FOR IT.  DODGE HAD SAID IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULT THAT THE CLOCKSPRING HAD GONE BAD AND MADE THE AIRBAG GO BAD.  I THEN CALLED DODGE MYSELF AND TALKED TO THEIR WARRANTY DEPARTMENT (JESSICA).  AFTER TALKING WITH HER DODGE MANAGER, SHE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR IT.  SHE SAID THAT THERE WERE NO ENGINEERING PROBLEMS WITH EITHER THE CLOCKSPRING OR THE AIRBAG.  SHE GAVE ME A CASE REFERENCE NUMBER OF 8889836.  I CALLED KOON'S, THE DODGE DEALERSHIP, BACK AND ASKED WHETHER THEY WERE POSITIVE THAT THE AIRBAG ITSELF WAS BAD IN ADDITION TO THE CLOCKSPRING.  THE REASON BEING THAT A REPAIR OF THE CLOCKSPRING WAS APPROXIMATELY $200 VERSUS $800 FOR BOTH THE CLOCKSPRING AND AIRBAG.  THEY AGAIN SAID THAT THE CLOCKSPRING HAD MADE THE AIRBAG GO BAD AND THAT THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY UNLESS IT WAS REPLACED ALONG WITH THE CLOCKSPRING.  I TOLD THEM BASED ON THEIR RECOMMENDATION TO REPLACE THE CLOCKSPRING AND AIRBAG.  THE FINAL COST WAS $816.37.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN ENGINEERING SAFETY DEFECT ON DODGE'S BEHALF.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2000, AND THEN AGAIN ON JAN 1, 2001, I EXPERINCED NO TRACTION ON THE TIRES, AND SLID PURPOSEFULLY ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS INTO SNOWBANKS, THE FIRST TIME TO AVOID HITTING A CAR IN FRONT OF ME WHILE TRAVELLING WITH MY FAMILY OF FIVE, AND THEN AGAIN TO AVOID SLIDING INTO A BLIND INTERESECTION.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO A GOODYEAR DEALER ON 1/1/01, AND BOUGHT GOODYEAR AQUATREAD 3'S.  THE CAR HANDLES ADMIRABLY WITH THESE TIRES.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE PIRELLI MANUFACTURER WHO STATED THAT THESE TIRES ARE RATED SUMMER TIRES.  I AM SHOCKED THAT ANY TIRE COMPANY WOULD PUT ANY DRIVER  NEEDLESSLY IN DANGER BY PUTTING SUMMER RATED TIRES IN AN ALLWEATHER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR ALL-WEATHER TIRES.  THE COMPANY OFFERED AN UNACCEPTABLE REMEDY.  I AM REPORTING THESE INCIDENTS TO YOU TO ATTEMPT TO DETER PIRELLI FROM THIS MISLEADING AND POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT PRACTICE.  I WAS TRAVELLING NO MORE THAN 10-15 MILES PER HOUR, ALLOWING PLENTY OF TIME AND DISTANCE TO STOP.  I ALSO RIDE MOTORCYCLES AND AM VERY AWARE OF ROAD SURFACE, STOPPING DISTANCES, AND ALTERNATIVE AVENUES OF ESCAPE.  IT WAS THIS EXPERIENCE THAT KEPT ME FROM CRITICALLY OR OTHERWISE INJURING MY FAMILY OR ANOTHER FAMILY WHILE RELYING TO MY DETRIMENT ON THE REPUTATION OF THE PIRELLI TIRE COMPANY IN PROVIDING PROPER TIRES IN MY AREA.  THE COMPANY IS APPARENTLY LOOKING TO DIVERT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR PRODUCT.  ARE THERE ANY OTHER REPORTS OF PIRELLI TIRE FAILURE THAT I MAY SEE?

SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE HAD FIVE FAILURES OF THE REAR (MOSTLY RIGHT) SHOCKS.  CURRENTLY WE ARE SCHEDULED TO HAVE A SIXTH REPLACEMENT OF REAR RIGHT SHOCK ON 06/22/00.  NOT ONLY DOES THIS RIGHT SHOCK PROBLEM SEEM HABITUAL, THE DEALER INSISTS THAT THIS IS NOT A \"LEMOM\" PROBLEM AND NOT A HABITUAL ONE.  SIX TIMES TO HAVE A SHOCK REPLACEMENT WITH ONLY 43,700 MILES ON A CAR?  WE FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO GO TO GET THE HELP WE NEED TO EITHER GET THE SHOCKS FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL OR FOR A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION INTO OUR CAR TO SEE IF THE FRAME OF THE CAR WAS BUILT CROOKED.  THAT IS OUR GUT FEEL AS WE HAVE HAD CONSISTENT PROBLEMS WITH THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VAN.  NOT ONLY THE RIGHT SHOCKS BUT ALSO THE RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER DOOR HAS NEEDED ALIGNMENT FOUR TIMES AND WE HAVE HAD TWO LEAKS ON THE RIGHT SIDE FRONT ROOF.  HELP US AS WE ARE FEELING VERY STUCK IN WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET THIS VEHICLE FIXED PROPERLY OR TAKE STEPS TO GET DODGE TO STAND UP TO THIER \"FIVE STAR\" PERFORMANCE AND HELP US GET THIS VAN FIXED!  WE HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT DODGE BECAUSE OF THIS HABITUAL PROBLEM WITH THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS VEHICLE.  WHEN WE PURCHASED THIS VAN ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO, WE EXPECTED QUALITY AND NOT TO HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO THE REPAIR SHOP EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR SHOCK REPAIRS, ETC.  OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS CAR WAS TO BE A CAR THAT WOULD PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO OUR FAMILY FOR AT LEASE TEN YEARS.  WE CAN NOT AFFORD TO CHANGE VEHICLES EVERY FIVE YEARS!  HELP US!!  THERE IS SOMETHING INHERIANTLY WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE TO REQUIRE SIX SHOCK REPLACEMENTS IN LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHY!!  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND ASSISTANCE. *AK",

AT A COST OF 300 DOLLARS, WE AGREED IN HOPES THAT THE LIGHT PROBLEM WOULD BE CURED EVEN THOUGH NOTHING SEEMED WRONG. AFTER PICKING UP THE VEHICLE THE NEXT MORNING, WE NOTICED THAT THE VAN WAS RUNNING TERRIBLY AND WOULD DIE WHEN STOPPED. FRUSTRATED THAT \"NO\" PROBLEM WITH OUR VAN PROGRESSED TO WORSE WE RETURNED TO THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK IT AGAIN. AFTER TESTING IT AGAIN, THEY SAID THE CAMSHAFT HAD TO BE REPLACED. SINCE WE HAD TO RETURN HOME FOR WORK, WE COULD NOT WAIT TO GET IT FIX. ON RETURNING HOME WE TOOK IT INTO OUR TRUSTED MECHANIC IMMEDIATELY.
