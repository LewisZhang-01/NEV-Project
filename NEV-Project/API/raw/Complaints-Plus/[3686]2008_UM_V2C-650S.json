        "summary": "I ASKED RYAN ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS. I LOOKED AT THE BBB REPORT. RYAN SAID THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT WITH THE 2008 ROADKING SCOOTER, SO I PURCHASED THE SCOOTER. I DID TALK TO THE PEOPLE TO TRY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, THE SAID THE PARTS WERE COMING AND THEY NEVER DID. THE PERSONS AT ALL NEW SPORTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED A LOT. THEY QUIT RESPONDING TO MY EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS AFTER THE BATTERY EXPLODED ON MY LEG. THEY WERE NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS. THE WARRANTY AT PURCHASED DATE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR TWO YEARS. THEY ONLY SENT A ONE YEAR WARRANTY. PROBLEMS ARE: THE BATTERY PRODUCES 17 VOLTS TO A 12 VOLT BATTERY, ALL THE LIGHTBULBS ARE BLOWN, THE KEY WAY IS ON THE REVERSE AND A DUPLICATE CAN  NOT BE MADE. I WAS TOLD BY THE TECH THAT THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS WERE A DUMMY SWITCH ON THIS MODEL. IT BROKE OFF DAY ONE. THERE ARE FLASHERS I CANT USE. EVERYTHING THE BBB REPORT SAID IS HAPPENING TO ME. I PURCHASED THIS SCOOTER ON GOOD TRUST, I WAS LIED TO  MAKE A SELL, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PRODUCT THAT WAS MISREPRESENTED. I ALSO SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THE PRODUCT SENT BACK. THEY HAVE NOT COMPLIED WITH THEIR OWN WARRANTY. I WOULD LIKE TO GET A FULL REFUND AND NOT HAVE TO PAY A SHIPPING CHARGE. I HAVE CONTACTED OTHER CONSUMER AGENCIES ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE ON THIS COMPANY. I WILL TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH CONSUMER AGENCY BEFORE I TAKE LEGAL ACTION. IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME PLEASE DO SO. THANK YOU.  THIS IS A DISPUTE WITH A COMPANY ALL NEW SPORTS LLC 104 W. 17TH ST. NEWTON KS 67114 WWW.ALLNEWSPORTS.COM. MY ACCOUNT NUMBER IS   _____________________________________________________________________.  I HAVE HAD SOME CONTACT WITH THESE PERSONS. THEY ARE UNWILLING TO HELP RESOLVE WITH THE DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE ISSUE. THEY WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. THANK YOU.    THIS VEHICLE IS A 2008 ROKETA SCOOTER.  *TR",
