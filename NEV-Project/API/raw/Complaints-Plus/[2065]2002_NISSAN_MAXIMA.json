        "summary": "When I first purchased this car I had immediate problems with the power steering fluid. The check engine light has remained on the entire time. But the car was hemorrhaging fluid, groaning, whining, and my steering was becoming extremely loose. I call the dealer that sold me the car, because I dropped 4 grand on what seemed like a nice vehicle with under 100k on it. Well, I bought the car right off the lot and they refused to repair it. Cool, I respect that. IF the inspection reports and other papers are clearly falsified. It couldn't have passed inspection under normal situations. But since the dealer owns their own shop, they could slap stickers on busted vehicles and send them off to be sold.  Eventually they do me \" A favor\" by replacing the power steering actuator/pump hoses & did work on towards a DTC code P0550. They give me that favor by charging me only for the parts, no labor. Totally cool, if work was done. It still has the same electrical tape  in areas that was \"fixed\". They clear my codes and off I go. Engine light cuts on again and I'm having the same issues. My power steering fluid looks like it's boiling or bubbling as well. Still getting the P0550 code as my main DTC.  Except now, I'm having major problems and my car has been sitting for a month. Not sure if the leaky fluid corroded components from before.  As of now I'm throwing DTCs for P0171, P0305, P0550 (twice), believe I have a vacuum leak, my exhaust system is damaged internally from the misfire codes and has also broken apart near the rear muffler, among other pending codes. Lastly, I was coming home from work and my car completely loses power and bogs waaaay down. Engine light is flashing and I have no control or power. I limp home, park the car, and haven't drove it since other than for test drives. After countless repairs for the same issues, among new repairs and issues I'm broke. Issues started on 3/24 through 12/21 Not had this car for a year and it's been a constant pain ever since.",

MY CAR STARTED TO CONSUME OIL AT AN ALARMING RATE IN APRIL 2007. IT WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER YET AGAIN AND I WAS TOLD IT HAD INTERNAL ENGINE DAMAGE AND THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM WITH THE EXTERNAL COMPONENTS. I WAS QUOTED $4,000-$4,200 FOR A REPLACEMENT ENGINE. I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN MY REPAIR WORK AND OIL CHANGES AT NISSAN DEALERS AND NOW WHEN MY EXTENDED WARRANTY IS GONE I AM TOLD I NEED TO BUY AN ENGINE. THIS IS UNFAIR AND COSTLY. I CANNOT USE THE CAR FOR WORK COMMUTES OR TO GET TO SCHOOL. NISSAN HAS BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT FAILURE AND THE MECHANICS BASICALLY ONLY CARE THAT YOU BUY/NOT BUY A MOTOR. I SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR THIS CAR WHEN IT IS CLEARLY A MECHANICAL DESIGN DEFECT THAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH TIME, MONEY AND PAIN. I LEFT IT AT MY SISTER'S APARTMENT FOR 3 MONTHS BECAUSE IT WOULD START AND CUT OFF, IF AT ALL. I DROVE THE CAR THE OTHER DAY AFTER TRYING TO GET IT STARTED FOR 2 DAYS. IT DROVE LIKE A DREAM. NOW I CAN'T GET IT STARTED TO EVEN GET TO AND FROM ANYWHERE. I HAVE NUMEROUS REASONS FOR THINKING NISSAN SHOULD BE LIABLE.

I WOULD HAVE TO INCUR THE COST OF REPLACEMENT.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE MASS/FLOW SENSOR ACCORDING TO THE BULLETIN AND I WONDER WHY THIS IS NOT A RECALL TYPE REPLACEMENT.

I CALLED THE SULLIVAN BROS. NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN KINGSTON MASS. AND THEY SAID THEY HAD MANY REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM FROM OTHERR NISSAN OWNERS WITH MAXIMAS NEAR OR AT THE SAME AGE AS MINE.

IN FACT ,I RAN THE CAR FOR 45 MINUTES MORE SINCER THE LINE WAS STILL FROZEN AFTER 20 MINUTES.  DRIVING TO WORK UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WAS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND EXTREMLY DANGEROUS.

BOTH CASES, THEY POPPED OUT THE GRILL THEN POPPED HEAD LIGHTS FROM SIDE. THE  RUMOR I HEARD WAS THAT SOME DEALER HAD 14 PAIRS OF MAXIMA'S HEAD LIGHTS STOLEN.  I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING INTERNET FORUM, LISTENING TO MECHANICS, AND SEARCHING PLACES TO GATHER INFORMATION REGARDING THIS MATTER AND FOUND OUT THAT THESE HEAD LIGHTS CAN BE STOLEN WITHIN FEW MINUTES.  IN FACT, ON SECOND TIME, 2 MAXIMA'S IN SAME PARKING LOT HAD HEAD LIGHTS STOLEN WITHIN MATTER OF MINUTES AS WITNESS RECALLED.    I HAVE SPOKEN TO A NISSAN DEALER AND THEY SAID, \"(THEY) PROVIDE ANTI-THEFT DEVICE FOR SUCH BUT WON'T BE AFFECTIVE SINCE IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HOOD LATCH.\"  AND, I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.    I HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE WITH HID.  TO TAKE HID HEAD LIGHTS OUT OF THIS VEHICLE, MECHANIC HAS TO REMOVE BUMPER, FEW STEEL BEAMS, AND LOTS OF SCREWS INCLUDING HIDDEN ONES.  IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN AN HOUR.  2002 & 2003 NISSAN MAXIMA'S HEAD LIGHTS ARE TOO EASY TO STEAL WHICH COSTS CONSUMERS TIME AND MONEY TO REPLACE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT TOOK MORE THAN 3 WEEKS TO REPAIR SINCE PARTS ARE OUT OF STOCK DUE TO INCREASING NUMBER OF STOLEN HEAD LIGHTS AND IT COST INSURANCE COMPANY OVER $2,500 PLUS RENTAL CAR WHICH TOTALS MORE THAN $3,500.
