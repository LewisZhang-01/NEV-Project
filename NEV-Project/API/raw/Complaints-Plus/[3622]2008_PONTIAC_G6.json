THERE IS AN ACTIVE RECALL FOR MY CAR'S YEAR, BUT SEARCHING WITH THE VIN NUMBER, IT DOESN'T SHOW THE RECALL APPLIES.

THE OTHER DAY WHILE DRIVING HOME, I EXPERIENCED VIBRATING IN MY BRAKES WHEN BRAKING. AT THAT TIME NO ABS LIGHT CAME ON OR TC CONTROL LIGHTS, HOWEVER WHEN HUBBY WAS GETTING READY TO TEST DRIVE IT, THE ABS LIGHT AND BOTH TC LIGHTS CAME ON AND HAVE STAYED ON. BRAKES ARE WORKING FINE AT THE MOMENT, I TOOK IT TO A SERVICE CENTER AND CHECKED FOR ADDITIONAL RECALLS (BECAUSE I READ ABOUT ONE ON THIS ISSUE SOMEWHERE THE OTHER DAY WHEN SEARCHING) BUT THEY ASSURED ME THERE ARE NO RECALLS FOR SUCH AN ISSUE WITH MY VIN. THE CAR CURRENTLY ONLY HAS 123,000 MILES ON IT. MY NEXT STEP I GUESS IS TO TAKE IT TO ADVANCE AUTO FOR A SCAN AND SEE IF ANYTHING SHOWS UP :( I DO A LOT OF TRAVELLING SO I NEED A DEPENDABLE/RELIABLE/SAFE VEHICLE.

CORP GM CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS SINCE GIVEN ME THE RUNAROUND.  I CALLED HER ON IT AND POINT BLANK ASKED IF GM WOULD BE ISSUING A RECALL AND REPAIRING THESE DRIVERS SEATS. I RECEIVED HER RESPONSE THIS MORNING, IN PART:    I KNOW THAT IT CAN BE TROUBLING TO WORRY ABOUT VEHICLE SAFETY. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR SAFETY IS OF THE UPMOST IMPORTANCE TO US. WE CERTAINLY WANT OUR CUSTOMERS TO KNOW THEY CAN RELY ON THEIR VEHICLES... I LOOKED INTO THE VIN YOU PROVIDED AND FOUND 0 OPEN RECALLS OR SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR VEHICLE RELATING TO THIS CONCERN. UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO YOUR VEHICLE S AGE AND MILEAGE YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF YOUR BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY AND MOST LIKELY ANY ASSOCIATED COSTS, IF YOU CHOOSE TO WORK WITH A GM DEALER, WILL BE CUSTOMER PAY.    THAT WAS HER RESPONSE IS AFTER THE DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED AND PRICED THE BROKEN DRIVER SEAT.

THE CAR SLID SIDEWAYS TO THE LEFT MID TURN AND LEFT US COMPLETELY SIDEWAYS ACROSS BOTH LANES. I WAS IN A PANIC AS IT HAPPENED SO FAST, BEFORE I COULD REACT A LARGE TRUCK ROUNDED THE CORNER COMING UP THE HILL, HE QUICKLY HIT HIS BREAK AND VEERED TOWARD THE DITCH, LUCKILY HE WAS ABLE TO STOP ABOUT 3 FOOT FROM THE SIDE OF OUR CAR. HIS PASSENGER SIDE FRONT TIRE WENT OFF THE ROAD IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP BEFORE HITTING US. AFTER TAKING A DEEP BREATH AND PRAISING THE LORD FOR SPARING OUR LIVES I QUICKLY SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL AND SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE, THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED IT BACK ON AND NOTICED THE TRACTION CONTROL WARNING HAD TURNED OFF. AFTER QUICKLY CHECKING WITH THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS ALRIGHT, WE PROCEEDED HOME IN THE DEATH TRAP WE CALL OUR VEHICLE. IT WAS THE SINGLE MOST SCARIEST MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. ONE MONTH PRIOR (IN JULY) I HAD RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE (RECALL 13036) FROM GENERAL MOTORS THAT STATES THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION. THEY CLAIM THE STABILITY CONTROL, TRACTION CONTROL, ENGAGING AND DISENGAGING CRUISE CONTROL, PANIC BRAKING, AND PARK SHIFTER MAY DISABLE WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. ALSO THE BRAKE LIGHTS MAY NOT ILLUMINATE WHEN PEDAL IS PUSHED AND WILL STAY ILLUMINATED WHEN THE BRAKES ARE NOT IN USE CREATING AN EXTREME RISK FOR A REAR COLLISION. AGAIN THEY STATE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT OFFERED NO SOLUTION FOR US WHILE WE WAIT FOR THEM TO GET PARTS. I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP IN LATE JULY TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE RECALL AND WAS TOLD THE EXACT THING THE RECALL STATES. AGAIN, OFFERING NO SOLUTION OR EVEN A RENTAL CAR FOR MY FAMILY.  *TR",

I WAS UNAWARE THAT THIS HAPPENED UNTIL I EXITED THE FREEWAY, AND A MAN WHO WAS TRAVELING BEHIND ME TOLD ME WHAT HE OBSERVED. MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE ON AS I DROVE; AND NOT ON WHILE BRAKING (EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF HOW BRAKE LAMPS SHOULD OPERATE).   I WENT HOME, TESTED THE BRAKES AGAIN, AND THEY DID EXACTLY AS HE SAID.  WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS PUSHED, THE BRAKE LIGHT DID NOT GO ON.  I REPEATED THE SAME ACTION 3 TIMES AND THEN THE BRAKE LIGHTS BEGAN TO WORK PROPERLY.  I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GM DATED JULY 2014 APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS AGO.  THE HEADING OF THE LETTER STATES, \"IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL.\"  UPON RECEIPT OF THE LETTER, I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT RECALL 13036.  ALTHOUGH THE LETTER PLAINLY STATES THAT MY CAR IS RECALLED, THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED I MUST WAIT UNTIL THEY HAD THE INFORMATION,  THE BRAKE LIGHTS HAD NOT BEEN AN ISSUE AT THE TIME, AND I WAS WILLING TO WAIT.  HOWEVER, I HAD EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL DISENGAGING, AND I TURNED IT OFF, AND DID NOT USE IT AGAIN, AS I FOUND THAT TO BE AN EASILY REMEDIED PATCH.  THE RECALL INCLUDES THE BODY CONTROL MODULE, WHICH AFFECTS BOTH THE CRUISE CONTROL AND MY BRAKES.  I CALLED GM TODAY AND THEY GOT IN TOUCH WITH A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHO GAVE ME A RENTAL CAR TO USE TODAY UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. UPON RETURNING HOME, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP ADVISING GM MAY NOT PAY FOR THE RENTAL.  GM IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.  MY TWO CHILDREN AND I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN RUN OVER BY A SEMI TRUCK WHILE TRAVELING ON THIS BUSY FREEWAY.  GM IS WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE NO LIVES ARE LOST DUE TO THEIR NEGLIGENCE.

THEY'VE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND CHARCOAL CANISTER A TOTAL OF THREE TIMES AND THEY EVEN REPLACED THE GAS TANK DURING ROUND THREE.

I'M JUST WAITING FOR IT TO STALL ON ME AGAIN AND I PRAY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN ON AN ON RAMP. ALL REPAIRS ARE DOCUMENTED THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP.    IN APRIL, BOTH LOW-BEAM HEADLIGHTS BEGAN WORKING SPORADICALLY AND WITHIN A WEEK, QUIT WORKING COMPLETELY. I WENT TO A SHOP CLOSE TO THE OFFICE AND PAID $50 TO HAVE BOTH LOW-BEAM BULBS REPLACED. AFTER ABOUT THREE WEEKS, THE DRIVER'S SIDE BULB WAS OUT AGAIN. I RETURNED TO THE SHOP AND THEY TOOK THE HEAD LAMP OUT AND SHOWED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE WIRING HARNESS OF THE HEAD LAMPS. THE WIRING HAD BECOME SO HOT, THE WIRE INSULATION HAD MELTED OFF AND THE WIRES ARE EXPOSED CAUSING A SHORT AND BLOWING THE BULBS. I'M NOW CONCERNED THAT THE ELECTRICAL ISSUES ARE MORE WIDESPREAD AND COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONTINUED PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM. THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH, BUT IF THE MANUFACTURING DEALERSHIP CAN'T RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, I'M NOT HOPEFUL THAT MY CAR WILL EVER RUN CORRECTLY AGAIN.

BOTH REAR DOORS ARE LOCKING/UNLOCKING ERRATICALLY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT MASTER CONTROL.  SOMETIMES THE PASSENGER DOOR WON'T UNLOCK OR LOCK AND OTHER TIMES THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR WON'T WORK. THE RESULT IS YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE BACK SEAT DOOR(S) AND WOULD NEED TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW FOR THE LOCKED DOOR FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT MASTER WINDOW CONTROL AND REACH IN FROM THE EXTERIOR TO UNLOCK/LOCK THE INTERIOR DOOR LOCK KNOB MANUALLY FROM THE OUTSIDE OR CRAWL INTO THE BACK SEAT TO OPERATE THE LOCK KNOB MANUALLY. IF THE WINDOW CONTROL GOES BAD THE ONLY OPTION WOULD BE CRAWLING INTO THE BACK SEAT TO MANUALLY OPERATE LOCK KNOB.  DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD UNTIL YOU CONSIDER DRIVERS NEW TO THIS PROBLEM, AN ELDERLY, INVALID OR BABY IN THE BACK SEAT/CAR SEAT CAN'T BE ACCESSED WITHOUT A DELAYS. SINCE THE BACK DOORS DON'T LOCK CONSISTENTLY YOU HAVE TO GO TO EACH DOOR IF IT DOESN'T LOCK AND LOCK IT MANUALLY AT THE LOCK KNOB WHICH MEANS IT PROBABLY WON'T UNLOCK LATER WITHOUT USING THE MANUAL KNOB THROUGH THE WINDOW FROM THE EXTERIOR OR CRAWLING INTO THE BACK SEAT,  I'M NOT A SAFETY EXPERT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ITS ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD PRACTICE TO SHUT AND THEN LOCK ALL THE DOORS WHEN DRIVING, DOESN'T THAT ADD A SAFETY FUNCTION TO THE LOCK MECHANISM?

THE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT HAD BURNED A SPOT AND THERE WAS A VISIBLE SCORCH MARK ON THE SEAT.

WE THEN SET UP A TIME TO HAVE MY CAR DIAGNOSED IN ORDER TO SEE IF GENERAL MOTORS WOULD DO ANYTHING TO ASSIST. ON TUESDAY, JAN. 21, 2014 I TOOK MY CAR TO SERRA CHEVROLET TO BE DIAGNOSED. AT 5:00PM WHEN I GOT OFF WORK AND WENT TO GO GET MY CAR, SERRA CHEVROLET INFORMED ME THAT GENERAL MOTORS WOULD ONLY PAY ROUGHLY 10% AND THAT THE DAMAGE DONE AND THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION WAS: \"FOUND HIGH RESISTANCE IN PASSENGER HEAT ELEMENT CAUSING CUSHION AND COVER TO BURN\". THE MALFUNCTION WITH THE SEAT ALSO CAUSED THE AIRBAG SENSOR IN THE SEAT TO MALFUNCTION AND NOW MY SERVICE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON.  CHRYSLER HAD THIS SAME ISSUE AND THEY RECALLED THEIRS. THIS IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE RECALLED, SOMEONE COULD GET HURT POSSIBLY EVEN FATALLY.

THEN THEY TURN OFF.  WHAT A MESSED UP WAY FOR A SAFETY SYSTEM LIKE BRAKE LIGHTS TO FAIL.  THE CRUISE CONTROL DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

THE BATTERY WAS NOT DRAINED AT ALL.  IT WOULD JUST BE DEAD UNTIL I GAVE IT A GOOD JUMP. AND ANOTHER THING THE KEY FOBS ARE TOTALLY MESSED UP.  THEY BARLEY WORK ANYMORE.

I TOOK MY CAR TO A REPAIR SHOP WHERE I WAS CHARGED $162.90 FOR A NEW BRAKE SWITCH THAT WAS NOT NEEDED. UPON FINDING THE ISSUE STILL IN EXISTENCE, I CONTACTED THE SHOP TO REQUEST A REFUND, WHICH I WAS ULTIMATELY DENIED. THE REPAIR SHOP STATED THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN ISSUE WITH BRAKE LIGHTS, EVEN THOUGH THEY WITNESSED IT THEMSELVES WHILE MY CAR WAS THERE FOR MULTIPLE DAYS.     UPON FINDING NO ONE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE AN IDEA HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE, I FOUND A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OF A DEMONSTRATION TO FIX THE ISSUE, HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=N7RA7MC_TLO. I TOOK MY CAR TO A FRIEND WHO FOLLOWED THE STEPS IN THE VIDEO. MY BRAKES SEEM TO BE WORKING OK AT THIS POINT, BUT AS THE MAN IN THE VIDEO POINTS OUT, THE FIX MAY ONLY LAST FOR 8 OR SO MONTHS.    PLEASE NOTE THAT SINCE ?FIXING? MY BRAKE LIGHTS, I HAVE SEEN TWO G6?S ON THE ROAD WITH THIS BRAKE LIGHT ISSUE, OF WHICH THE DRIVERS MAY OR MAY HAVE NOT KNOWN. MY DAILY COMMUTE OFTEN INVOLVES TRAFFIC BACKUPS, AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE BEHIND A VEHICLE WITH THIS ISSUE, NOR WOULD I WANT ANYONE BEHIND ME UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT I AM BRAKING.     I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING NHTSA REGARDING THE BRAKE LIGHT ISSUE, AND HOPE TO GET A RECALL NOTICE.  *TR",

I HAVE TO CHECK THE DOOR EACH TIME I EXIT MY CAR, AS IT BEING LOCKED OR UNLOCKED IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE. I HAVE FOUND MANY POSTS ON WWW.G6OWNERSCLUB.COM WHERE OWNERS SHARE SIMILAR STORIES; ALONG WITH OTHER COSTLY, SAFETY ISSUES I EXPERIENCE. I WILL ALSO NOTE SOME OTHER ISSUES I HAVE REGARDING THE DOME LIGHT AND THE DOOR AJAR ESSAGE. I HAVE TO LEAVE MY DOME LIGHT IN THE OFF OSITION BECAUSE WHEN LEFT ON AUTO, IT DOES NOT DIM AND TURN OFF. ON DAYS I HAVE FORGOTTEN, I FIND MY DOME LIGHTS ON AFTER 12 OR SO HOURS OF NON-USE. IN AN EFFORT TO NOT FORGET AND DRAIN MY BATTERY, I LEAVE IT OFF; THIS LEADS TO MY HAVING TO GET IN AND OUT OF A DARK CAR AT NIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORNING. ALSO, THE DOOR AJAR MESSAGE DISPLAYS CONSTANTLY AND OFTEN MAKES A BEEPING NOISE IN WARNING. I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE DOOR SENSORS, CAUSING \"DOOR AJAR\" TO APPEAR. OTHER THAN BEING PURELY ANNOYED, MY CONCERN IS THAT IF A DOOR WERE TO EVER ACTUALLY BE AJAR, I WOULD HAVE NO PREMISE TO PULL OVER AND CHECK. ALSO, THE WARNING NOISE DOES SOUND AT TIMES WHEN THE MESSAGE IS NOT DISPLAYING, WHICH LEADS TO DISTRACTED DRIVING AS I CHECK FOR ISSUES ON MY INSTRUMENT PANEL AND THAT ALL PASSENGERS ARE WEARING SEAT BELTS. ALL THREE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES STARTED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF ONE ANOTHER IN 2011, SHORTLY AFTER MY LEASE ENDED AND I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IN READING MY CONCERNS. I HAVE ANTICIPATED A DAY FOR A RECALL TO ASSIST THOSE LIKE MYSELF, WHO LIVE ON A LIMITED INCOME AND CANNOT ADDRESS ALL OF THESE NON-DEBILITATING, YET UNSAFE G6 ISSUES, OUT-OF-POCKET.  *TR",

SYMPTOMS INCLUDE BRAKE LAMPS ILLUMINATING WHEN BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT DEPRESSED, BRAKE LAMPS FAILING TO ILLUMINATE WHEN BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED, CRUISE CONTROL WILL NOT ENGAGE AND GREATER THAN NORMAL BRAKE FORCE IS REQUIRED TO SHIFT VEHICLE OUT OF PARK. I OWN A 2008 PONTIAC G6 WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL, HOWEVER, MY VEHICLE IS EXPERIENCING THE EXACT PROBLEMS AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL NOTICE. I  STILL HAVE THE FACTORY WARRANTY BUT THE DEALER CANNOT FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, THEY REPLACED THE BRAKE SENSOR WHICH DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS RELATED TO THIS RECALL AS THEY HAVE FOUND NO CORROSION IN THE WIRING CONNECTOR.   I AM THEREFORE REQUESTING THAT NHTSA REQUIRE GM TO VALIDATE THE CAUSE AND EXPAND THE RECALL TO OTHER YEARS. AS NOTED IN THE RECALL NOTICE, \"BRAKE LAMPS THAT ARE NOT OPERATING PROPERLY MAY NOT WARN A DRIVER IN A FOLLOWING VEHICLE OF THE BRAKING STATUS AND COULD LEAD TO A CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING\". THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND I FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT GM WOULD NOT RECALL ANY VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM AND DETERMINE OTHER CAUSES. THANK YOU. *TR",

LOUD POP, PULL, OR CAR MOVEMENT), THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR INDICATED TO CHECK TIRE PRESSURE.  THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR INDICATED 15 PSI IN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE.  I PULLED OFF THE ROADWAY, WHILE MONITORING  THE PRESSURE MONITOR, AND THE TIRE WAS QUICKLY LEAKING AIR UNTIL THE TIRE WAS FULLY DEFLATED.  I DID NOT RUN INTO, OR OVER, ANY DEBRIS, CURB OR OTHER OBSTACLE.  THE LEFT FRONT TIRE SPLIT ON THE INSIDE FACE OF THE TIRE (FACING THE CAR), RIGHT WHERE THE SIDEWALL MEETS THE TREAD AND STARTS TO CURVE AROUND.  THE SPLIT STARTED ABOUT 2/3 OF THE WAY FROM THE RIM, AND CONTINUED RADIATING OUTWARD TOWARD TREAD (AS OPPOSED TO ALONG THE SIDEWALL, PARALLEL TO TREAD) ABOUT AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF LONG.  IT IS A JAGGED SPLIT.  THERE WAS NOT ANY PUNCTURE, PENETRATION, OR CUT IN EVIDENCE.    I AM BEING TOLD THAT I NEED TO BUY A NEW TIRE, AND IF THE MANUFACTURER DETERMINES THE TIRE FAILED, THEN THE TIRE MANUFACTURER WILL DETERMINE ANY AMOUNT OF REFUND, IF ANY.    BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE SPLIT IN THE TIRE SIDEWALL, AND THE LACK OF ANY EXTERNAL INFLUENCING EVENT(S) PRIOR TO THE FAILURE, I BELIEVE THIS TIRE FAILED WITHOUT EXPLANATION.    AS ALL FOUR TIRES ARE OF THE SAME PRODUCTION LOT (BASED ON THE DOT #), I BELIEVE ALL FOUR TIRES SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND FULLY TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THE REMAINING THREE TIRES ARE PRONE TO FAILURE AS WELL.

I HAVE HAD IT IN TWICE TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE FIRST TIME THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE. THE NEXT TIME WHICH WAS JUST LAST WEEK, THEY REPLACED THE MAF SENSOR. THE CAR WAS FINE FOR 4 DAYS AND IT AGAIN, STALLED AS I WAS TURNING ONTO A STATE HIGHWAY. IT TOOK 8 CRANKS TO RESTART. IT WAS FINE FOR 2 DAYS, THEN ACTED UP AGAIN YESTERDAY. IT DIDN'T STALL, BUT THE SERVICE TRACTION, AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS WERE ON. ONSTAR HAS GIVEN ME CODES FROM THE AIR INTAKE SYSTEM TO THE THROTTLE CONTROL. THE DEALERSHIP ITSELF DOES A GOOD JOB AND IF ITS NOT ACTING UP I KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD DO. HOWEVER, RESEARCHING THE INTERNET I FOUND SOME GM YUKONS HAVING ALOT OF THE SAME ISSUES RELATED TO WIRING.  *TR",

I'VE NOW PARKED MY VEHICLE AND HAVEN'T BEEN DRIVING IT.  I HAVE TWO CHILDREN UNDER AGE 4 AND CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THAT DEATH TRAP.  AFTER I PULLED OVER TO A SAFE AREA, I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF AND ABOUT 10 MIN LATER ON AGAIN.  AFTER THAT, MY STEERING WAS FINE.  I'VE ALSO HAD THE RACK AND PINION REPLACED 3 TIMES FOR A CLICK SOUND THAT IS MADE ANYTIME I TURN TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT.  I'VE BEEN TOLD IT COULD BE THE STEERING LINKS OR EVEN THE TIE RODS AND STRUTS.  IT STILL MAKES THAT SOUND. EITHER WAY, ALL THREE TIMES A CERTIFIED GM MECHANIC REPLACED THE RACK AND PINION BECAUSE THEY WERE SURE THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE CLICK AND ALL MY FRONT END ISSUES.  WHEN I HAD THE FIRST RACK AND PINION REPLACED, THE WATER PUMP ALSO NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THIS CAR IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD.  I HAD THE SAME BODY SHOP WORK ON THE VEHICLE EACH TIME SOMETHING WAS REPLACED.  I'VE FEEL JIPPED.  I PAY ALMOST 400 A MONTH FOR A CAR THAT COULD KILL ME!     A DEFINITE RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE ELSE OR THEIR CHILDREN DIE OR THEMSELVES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS THING HAS BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SO LONG AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.  IT'S ABSURD.  *TR",

HAD CAR TOWED TO DEALERSHIP ON 4/27/08.  4/28/08 DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED TWO BROKEN WIRES IN THE VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR HARNESS. THEY INDICATED THAT SOMETHING HAD SEVERED THE WIRES AND THAT THE REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE WIRING HARNESS.  WHY WOULD TWO WIRES BE LEFT UNSHIELDED FROM THE ELEMENTS?  THE DEALERSHIP VIA MY REQUEST RECEIVED AN ONE TIME CUSTOMER GOODWILL WARRANTY APPROVAL.  I HAD THE MECHANIC SHOW THE AREA IN QUESTION.  HE HAS REINFORCED THE WIRES WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE.  IT APPEARS TO BE A GREAT REPAIR.  I AM NOT SURE WHY THE MANUFACTURE DID NOT DO THIS ORIGINALLY.  ERROR CODES PO722, COOOO AND PO700.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS DESIGN WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR OTHER CAR OWNERS. AND COULD POSE A SAFETY ISSUE IF THE WIRING IS SEVERED AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  *TR",
