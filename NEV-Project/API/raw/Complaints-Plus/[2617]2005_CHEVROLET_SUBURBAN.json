ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPLYING THE BRAKES, I LOST ALL BRAKING POWER AND RESORTED TO UTILIZING THE MANUAL PARKING BRAKE TO BRING THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL AND DRIVE IT CAREFULLY BACK TO MY RESIDENCE. AT THE MOMENT OF FAILURE, THE DASHBOARD BRAKE INDICATOR LIGHT (AKA, IDIOT LIGHT) ILLUMINATED AND A \"SERVICE BRAKE SYSTEM\" MESSAGE APPEARED ON THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER. THE BRAKE INDICATOR LIGHT CONTINUED TO ILLUMINATE SPORADICALLY DURING THE TRIP BACK TO MY RESIDENCE WHEN TESTING THE BRAKE PEDAL FOR RESUMED FUNCTIONALITY.    AFTER ARRIVING HOME, I PERFORMED A QUICK INSPECTION OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND FOUND THAT THE PORTION OF THE BRAKES LINES LOCATED ON THE OUTBOARD PORTION OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRAME RAIL HAD RUSTED AND PERFORATED NEAR THE ABS MODULE, CAUSING THE FAILURE ALONG WITH MASSIVE FLUID LOSS (SEE ATTACHED PICS). I PERFORMED A CURSORY INTERNET SEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT THE NHTSA HAS ALREADY PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EXACT ISSUE AND THE INVESTIGATION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED WITH NO RECALL ISSUED BY GM.     OF NOTE, GM VEHICLES USE A MANUAL PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL SWITCH LOCATED WITHIN THE BRAKE COMBINATION VALVE THAT ISOLATES THE DAMAGED CIRCUIT IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE AND ALSO ILLUMINATES THE DASHBOARD BRAKE LIGHT. THIS SYSTEM DID NOT OPERATE IN THIS INSTANCE AS EVIDENCED BY LOSING ALL BRAKING, AS OPPOSED TO REDUCED BRAKING, AS WELL AS THE BRAKE LIGHT NOT REMAINING ILLUMINATED.    BASED ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND INDICATION OF RUST IN SEVERAL SPOTS ON THE BODY (E.G, TAILGATE), I BELIEVE THIS TRUCK WAS OPERATED IN ONE OF THE RUST BELT STATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BY A PRIOR OWNER.",

I'VE FOUGHT THIS TO THE POINT THAT I'VE WORN THE PAINT OFF THE SWITCH. IF YOU SEARCH THE INTERNET THIS IS A VERY PREVALENT PROBLEM WITH GM VEHICLES DURING THESE MODEL YEARS.

THAT CAN'T BE TRUE SINCE GM ISSUED A TSB FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT THE RECOMMENDED FIX (REPROGRAMMING THE DRIVER DOOR SWITCH) ACTUALLY DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. IN FACT, WHEN THE DEALER REPROGRAMMED MY GMC IT ACTUALLY MADE IT WORSE TO WHERE IT HAPPENS MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY. I CONTACTED GM AND EVEN THOUGH I TOOK IT TO A DEALER 4-5 MONTHS AGO WHERE THEY COULDN'T FIX IT, GM SAYS I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER (PAY ANOTHER $100 DIAGNOSTIC FEE) TO MEET THEIR POLICY THAT THEY WILL ONLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE IF YOU'VE BEEN TO A DEALER WITHIN THE LAST 30 DAYS. SOME REPORTS ARE THE SEAT HEATER ELEMENTS ARE SHORTING OUT. EITHER WAY THIS CREATES A VERY UNSAFE SITUATION FOR DRIVERS. GM SAYS I CAN PULL THE FUSE FOR THE SEAT HEATERS. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU REMOVE THE FUSE LABELED \"SEAT HEATER\" IT ACTUALLY DOES NOTHING. THE SEATS ARE STILL POWERED AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. THIS CLEARLY INDICATES AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND DESIGN FLAW. THE ONLY SURE CURE IS TO REMOVE THE 30 AMP BREAKER UNDER THE DASH RENDERING YOUR DRIVER/PASSENGER INOPERATIVE. GM MUST FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED FROM BEING DISTRACTED.  *TR",

THE SPEEDOMETER IN OUR SUBURBAN ALSO BEGAN READING ERRATICALLY ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND HAS NOW PEGGED ITSELF AND IS STUCK AT 120 MPH.  FORTUNATELY WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INCIDENTS WHEN THE SPEEDOMETER FAILED.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE CHEVROLET MAY HAVE A CONTINUING PROBLEM AND MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY COMPONENT.  ADDITIONALLY, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR OTHER INCIDENT REPORTS ON THIS MATTER, I DISCOVERED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM MAY BE MASKED BY THE FACT THAT IT IS APPLICABLE TO NUMEROUS DIFFERENT MODELS AND YEARS.  IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO COMPILE THE REPORTS FOR ALL MODELS OF THE SUBURBAN, YUKON AND SILVERADO TRUCKS AND THEIR GMC CLONES FOR THE 2003 TO 2005 OR 2006 MODEL YEARS.

I FOUND OUT ACCIDENTALLY THAT WHEN YOU START THE VEHICLE, THE SPEEDOMETER RESETS BY 5MPH.  I WOULD HAVE TO START THE VEHICLE REPEATEDLY TO GET IT BACK TO ZERO.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THE STARTER, THIS WAS MY ONLY OPTION AT THE TIME.  I JUST SAW SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET THAT SAID TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE AND THEN TRY TO START IT.  BY DOING THIS IT WOULD RESET THE SPEEDOMETER BY 5MPH EVERY TIME WITHOUT ENGAGING THE STARTER.  THIS DID WORK, BUT WHEN I DROVE THE VEHICLE THE NEXT TIME, THE SPEEDOMETER DID NOT WORK AT ALL.

HE COULD FIND NO PUNCTURES, FOREIGN OBJECTS OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE TIRE. GM REVIEWED THIS AND INFORMED ME THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DECLARE A DEFECT, SO THEY REFERRED ME TO THE TIRES MANUFACTURER, FIRESTONE. THE FIRESTONE SHOP IN MOON, PA ALSO COULD NOT FIND ANY PUNCTURE OR EXTERNAL DAMAGE. THE MANAGER THERE SAID THE BLOWOUT COULD HAVE HAPPENED FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS OTHER THAN A DEFECT AND TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT IT HAD BEEN DRIVEN WITH TOO LITTLE TIRE PRESSURE. THAT CANNOT BE THE CASE. THE TIRES HAD BEEN ROTATED AND THE AIR PRESSURE CHECKED BY THE DEALERSHIP WITHIN THE PREVIOUS MONTH AND THE VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH AN AIR PRESSURE SENSOR THAT WARNS OF DROPS.
