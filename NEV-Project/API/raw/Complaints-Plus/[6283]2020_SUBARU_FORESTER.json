I drove a Forester 2002 for nearly fifteen years with no issue ever.

I called Subaru of America and also my dealership and neither one seemed receptive to my concerns, nor showed any awareness of windshield issues. I did my own research after the glass company alerted me to the fact that there is a class action lawsuit for my very vehicle in process due to overwhelming problems with the windshields cracking for no apparent reason. I find this really concerning. Subaru markets itself for its all terrain vehicles, and while I only drive on roads and highways, they are vehicles supposedly designed to go through much rougher terrain. The problems with the windshields are a concerning safety alert for all the owners of these vehicles, and particularly for those who use them in a variety of terrains.

The second time, January 2022, they said it's because I don't drive the car enough.  Said I have to drive or idle the car for at least 15 minutes twice per week which is a waste of gas and time for something that shouldn't happen to start with!  There are already lawsuits about this constant battery drain but the 2020 Forester isn't included and it should be!

This was a new vehicle purchase in 2019.  The safety of my toddler and I were at risk as soon as we entered the beginning of a turnabout.

The car shut off again and when I turned the ignition on the wheel became stuck along with the ignition.    I turned the emergency/Caution lights on and thought that would provide us safety from other cars colliding into us.  I noticed cars would wait directly behind me and then honk their horn if I did not drive-off.  Nearby pedestrians walked by and mentioned the emergency/caution lights were not flashing.

If my keys are left in the ignition even briefly, as I get in an out for small tasks, the car battery is dead. Other times it is simply dead for no reason at all. In my over 50 years of driving all sorts of cars and trucks, I have never had this problem.  I have had constant problems with this car battery dying in as little as 5 minutes after driving 50 miles.  I have brought this problem to Grayson Subaru\u2019s attention and spent hours waiting as they checked for problems. They never find anything.  I have made numerous calls. They assure me this is \u201cnormal\u201d. This is NOT normal. Not in my over 50 years of driving cars.  I am forced to carry a car booster with me at all times. This is a TERRIBLE situation for a car which typically is owned by people who often camp, are doing sports in remote places or need a small rugged car for farm work or field research or outdoor activities.  Here are just a few times I have contacted Grayson Subaru over this problem. I have had dead battery many more times than this (just in past 2 weeks Jan 5, 10 and 14, 2022), but have had to jump it off because I was in a dangerous.

He said, \"that because of the EyeSight System, Subaru had to make the glass thinner than the industry standard for it to work consistently, they chose the higher safety rating over a stronger windshield.\"  He checked to se if we had purchased windshield replacement insurance, which we had not. He told me he has a friend that has gone through six windshield's on his Outback in the last 2 years. He said the problem was with any Subaru with The EyeSight System.

The fire breached the firewall between the engine compartment and passenger compartment within less then a minute. Within 2 minutes the engine compartment and front seat area was completely engulfed in flames and within 3 minutes the entire vehicle was engulfed. It appears the fire started as the fuel shut-off system that is supposed to stop the fuel from flowing once the airbags are deployed failed. This put the occupants of this vehicle and any others had this been a collision with another vehicle in extreme danger of serious injury if not even death. Had the driver been incapacitated, not been able to open the door or had a child to remove from a car seat there would have been certain death due to the extremely rapid spread of the fire throughout the entire vehicle. This has been reported to Subaru of America. The vehicle is currently being inspected by the insurance carrier. There were no prior warnings that there were any concerns with the safety features of this vehicle. It was just serviced by the dealer one month prior to the accident.

A few months before I got into my car and the radio was blaring and constantly switching channels and I was not able to turn the radio off. When I got home and turned off the car and turned the ignition back on 30 minutes later it had stopped. We notified the incident to Subaru at the next oil change. I immediately notified USSA car insurance and filed a claim. I have not had the damages assessed for repair because I have to wait for the inspection results from Subaru.

No other cars were around us at the time and it was an open road (e.g., we did not drive under an overpass). We don't know how the chip occurred. We continued driving and then parked the car in our garage. Four days later, with the car still in the garage, we discovered the chip had grown into a more than 20-inch crack horizontally on the passenger side of the car. We have been in touch with our insurance company and they have recommended a specific auto glass company to repair it. But we've been told it'll take 4 weeks or more to receive the replacement windshield and recalibrate it. We have since learned from searching the Internet that cracking windshields on Subaru models is a common complaint among Subaru owners.",

I now keep a trickle charger on the car continuously.  This seems to keep the battery charge up to 98%.  I have retained the original battery which holds a charge indefinitely out of the vehicle.

        "summary": "What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? - The original battery on our 2020 Subaru Forester died after some repairs related to getting rear ended. The battery died for the first time in March 2021, 8 months after we purchased the car with around 5500 miles on it. That battery was replaced with a brand new Subaru battery. The battery has died 3 times since being replaced. The current battery is available for inspection.  In addition to the battery dying, we have recently noticed two situations where the rear hatch has not properly latched. I have a video of the rear hatch trying to latch and popping back open over and over again. I've only noticed this twice, but the first time I noticed this I realize we had been driving with the rear hatch open and our dog could have been put in serious risk if the rear hatch opened.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? Issues with the battery dying multiple times puts me at risk of being stranded. The issue of the rear hatch means that anything that is placed in the rear of the vehicle may not be properly secured and could potentially fly out of the vehicle if the unlatched rear hatch opens while driving.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? The original dead battery was initially identified by a body shop. The dealer was not able to find anything wrong with the vehicle upon first inspection, but we are going to take it in again.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? The vehicle was inspected by a body shop (recommended by our insurance) and the dealer.   Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? The only symptom we are able to routinely detect is a low voltage on our battery, which we believe indicates a parasitic draw.",

Number of instances where this has malfunctioned in a way that is unsafe. Driving in upstate NY on foggy morning, winding hilly roads, 50mph roads. Road had a driveway with a parked car not moving, parked and the pre collision system tried to break, so slowed down the car but there was another coming behind from a hilly turn, not aware I would suddenly slow, especially as I did not anticipate the car would try to put on breaks on its own for a parked unmoving car. No collision resulted fortunately, but unsafe if the car behind had not been able to slow to accomodate for the faulty detection by subaru\u2019s eyesight, thinking the parked unmoving car was a sudden stopping vehicle in front of me, when the winding road was actually clear for me to continue driving. Another incident on another road where a series of 4-5 cars driving constant speed, fixed distance from each other, then first car signalled to turn right and stopped; cars behind just went around them slightly as they were waiting to turn, and I was going to follow suit, the train of cars in front of me, when suddenly eyesight pre collision detected that turning vehicle as something to try to brake for, and the car behind me did not expect the sudden breaking attempt to slow down, and again, close call, no collision resulted but unsafe when the human driver was expecting to continue along with the other train of cars and not expecting a sudden stop. I have called subaru both dealership and main office but informed there is no way to permanently disable the pre collision setting in the car.  Concerned that if this feature is on, and erroneously detects an object in front, such as that parked unmoving car, in other situations the cars behind me may not be able to accomodate the attempts at sudden breaking by the subaru eyesight technology.

BUT ALL MY OTHER CARS OVER THE YEARS HAD LOTS OF TINY AND NOT-SO-TINY NICKS FROM SMALL ROCKS THAT NEVER SPREAD OUT AT ALL. THE WINDSHIELD ON MY PRIOR 2014 FORESTER WITH 90K MILES ON IT ONLY HAD TO BE REPLACED TWICE IN 6 YEARS. IN BOTH CASES I WAS HIT BY LARGER PEPPLES THAT LEFT SIGNIFICANT (LIKE 1/2 INCH) SPIDER NICKS.

I HAVE NEVER HAD A WINDSHIELD CRACK IN ALL THAT TIME. MY RECENT INCIDENT WITH MY SUBARU HAPPENED WHEN THIS VEHICLE WAS ONLY 11 MONTHS OLD!!! I DO NOT FEEL THAT A SMALL PEBBLE WITH VEHICLES TRAVELING AT MODEST SPEED SHOULD HAVE SO EASILY CRACKED THE WINDSHIELD OF MY FORESTER THAT I PURCHASED BASED UPON ITS SAFETY FEATURES, INCLUDING THE EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST TECHNOLOGY WHICH WAS COMPROMISED BY THIS CRACK. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED TOO EASILY IN THIS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD VEHICLE.",

MY PREVIOUS 08 SUBARUS WINDSHIELD NEVER HAD TO BE FIXED AND IT HAD BEEN DRIVEN OVER 180000 MILES. IT TOOK LARGE ROCKS AND JUST RECEIVED SMALL NICKS. I HAVE ONLY 1148 MILES ON THIS NEW CAR AND ALREADY HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD REPAIRED. SUBARU NEEDS TO STEP UP AND REVISE THE THICKNESS OF THE WINDSHIELD. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IS UNSAFE.",

HE SAID THAT ANYTIME SOMETHING IMPACTS THE WINDSHIELD THIS SHOULD BE EXPECTED, BUT I AM 100% CERTAIN THAT NO OTHER VEHICLE I'VE DRIVEN WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH A CRACKED WINDSHIELD IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES.
