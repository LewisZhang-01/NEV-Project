MY PURCHASE DEALER FINALLY SENT A TOW TRUCK AND I HAD TO GO ALONG WITH THEM AT 9 PM TO THE SERVICE CENTER AND EVEN THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY DON?T HAVE LOANERS AVAILABLE. LUCKILY A LADY THEN JUST DROPPED HER LOANER CAR WHICH WAS GIVEN TO ME. THE SERVICE CENTER MENTIONED THAT THE POWER STEERING MODULE FAILED AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE STEERING FAILURE ON A 4 DAYS OLD AUDI  I CLEARLY MENTIONED THE DEALER THAT I WONT BE TAKING THE OLD CAR AND ASKED FOR A NEW ONE. ITS BEEN MORE THAN A WEEK AND THE AUDI RESPONSE WAS SOO SICK THEY CANT FIND A SIMILAR CAR FOR ME. IF THE COLOR MATCHES THEN THE OPTIONS I PREFERRED WOULDN'T OR IF THEY MATCH THE COLOR WOULDN'T. I AM SOO FRUSTRATED THAT EVEN THE SO CALLED PREMIUM BRAND CANT EVEN SATISFY THEIR CUSTOMER WITH WHAT THEY WANT? THEY DECIDED WHAT CAR I SHOULD BE TAKING BY GIVING ME VERY FEW OPTIONS WHICH DOESN?T SATISFY WHAT I WANT EVEN AFTER SPENDING A LOT. THE STEERING FAILURE IS SUCH A LIFE HAZARD AND WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. SOME SERIOUS ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN ON THIS BUT DON'T KNOW WHOM TO CONTACT.

FIRST, WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED BUT MOST COMMONLY OVER 50 MPH THE STEERING EXHIBITED A \"SLIP AND CONNECT FEELING\" WHERE THE STEERING WOULD FEEL DISCONNECTED (OR VERY LOOSELY CONNECTED) TO THE WHEELS. LARGE DRIVER STEERING INPUTS RESULTED IN ONLY MINOR CORRECTIONS. ONLY WHEN TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL ABOUT TWO INCHES IN EITHER DIRECTION WOULD THE STEERING GRAB AND FEEL NORMAL AGAIN. THIS PHENOMENON  HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL NEAR MISS ACCIDENTS WHERE THE CAR SWERVES INTO THE ADJACENT LANE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS A STEERING NOTCHINESS WHICH OCCURS AT ANY SPEED AND MOST APPARENT DURING TURNS. I CAN BEST DESCRIBE THIS AS IF THE STEERING, WHICH IS ELECTRONIC, CHANGES FROM HIGH TO LOW TO HIGH BOOST WHILE TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL.

        "summary": "LOST ALL COOLANT DUE TO RADIATOR LEAK FROM ROAD HAZARD DAMAGE CAUSED BY BAD DESIGN OF FRONT LOWER GRILL. IT HAS NO PROTECTIVE MESH AND CLEAR OPENINGS FOR ROCKS TO PROTRUDE.    I FOUND THIS ON AUDI FORUM  TWO PEOPLE NOW ON THE VAIRIOUS BOARDS HAVE THOUGHT THEY LOST THEIR WATER PUMP, BUT IN FACT HAVE HAD HOLES PUNCHED IN THEIR INTERCOOLING RADIATORS BY ERRANT ROAD DEBRIS WHICH STRIKES THE RADIATOR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND PERFORATES IT. SINCE THE ENGINE AND SUPERCHARGER COOLING SYSTEMS SHARE THE SAME OVERFLOW CONTAINER, BUT ARE SEPERATE LOOPS, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE BOTH SYSTEMS HAVE LOST ALL COOLANT LIQUID, DUE TO THE ONE WAY VALVE SYSTEM, THE HEATING AND COOLING OF THE COOLANT AND THE SHARED OVERFLOW TANK. THIS IS NOT COVERED BY AUDI WARRANTY, AND IS CONSIDERED WEAR AND TEAR. IT ALSO REMOVES THE CAR FROM SERVICE UNTIL IT PARTS ARE OBTAINED AND IT CAN BE REPAIRED, NOT TO MENTION THE COST AND FRUSTRATION.
