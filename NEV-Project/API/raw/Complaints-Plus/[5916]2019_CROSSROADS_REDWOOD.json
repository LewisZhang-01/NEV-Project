        "summary": "ON MAY 15, 2020, I PICKED UP MY 2019 CROSSROADS REDWOOD (3951WB) FROM CATOOSA, OKLAHOMA TO TAKE IT BACK TO ALPINE, TEXAS AFTER IT BEING AT TULSA RV FOR SIX MONTHS FOR SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY REPAIRS.  ON THE WAY BACK TO ALPINE, SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROUTE THE REAR AXLE'S RIGHT-SIDE LEAF SPRING SHEARED IN HALF.  DUE TO WEIGHT OF THE RV AND THE SIZE OF MY TRUCK, I DID NOT FEEL THE LEAF SPRING SHEAR IN HALF.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE CAMPGROUND IN ALPINE, I NOTICED THE RV WAS LEANING ABOUT THREE INCHES LOWER ON MY TRUCK ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  I HAD TO LEVEL THE RV WITH A RAMP ON A LEVEL SITE.  THE BROKEN LEAF SPRING WAS HIDDEN BY THE TIRE.  I LOOKED UNDER THE RV AND THEN SAW THE DAMAGE TO THE LEAF SPRING, I-BEAM AND MOTOR SUSPENSION SYSTEM.  KEYSTONE/LIPPERT SENT OUT A MOBILE TECH TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.  KEYSTONE HAD TO REPLACE TIRES WHICH ONLY HAD ABOUT 4500 MILES ON THEM.  THE LIPPERT TECHNICIAN DID NOT COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT, BUT HE HINTED THE LEAF SPRINGS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE RV.  HIS JOB IS TO GO TO BROKEN DOWN KEYSTONE RVS WITH LIPPERT CHASSIS SUSPENSION FAILURES.  I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER I COULD HAVE DRIVEN THE RV WITHOUT CUTTING DEEPER INTO THE I-BEAM OR FOR THE REAR AXLE TO RIP FREE FROM THE FRAME CAUSING ME TO WRECK OR INJURING MYSELF OR OTHERS AROUND ME.*DT*DT*JB*DT*JB",
