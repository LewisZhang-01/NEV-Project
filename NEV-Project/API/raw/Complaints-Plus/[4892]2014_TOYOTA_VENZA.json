AFTER 6 MONTHS, THERE IS A POPPING SOUND FROM THE ROOF WHEN MAKING TURNS OR GOING OVER THINGS LIKE RAILROAD TRACKS AND THE ROOF HAS BEGUN TO LEAK.  TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR THE LEAK REPAIR ON 8/7/15.  AS OF 8/17/15 THE ROOF IS LEAKING AGAIN AND THE POPPING SOUND IS GETTING WORSE AND SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER BREAKAGE IS NEAR.  WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT TOYOTA COULDN'T FIX DUE TO A LACK OF STRUCTURAL SUPPORTS IN THE ROOF WHICH ALLOWS FOR EXCESSIVE CHASSIS FLEX AND ADVISED TO LIVE WITH IT IF POSSIBLE.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN THAT TOYOTA NEEDS TO ADDRESS.  OTHER VENZAS HAVE ALSO HAD THE SAME ISSUE.",
