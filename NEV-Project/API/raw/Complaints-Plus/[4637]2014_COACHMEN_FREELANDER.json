WHEN WE RUN THE AIR CONDITIONER WE GET MOISTURE DRIPPING INTO THE LIVING SPACE OF THE RV.  MOISTURE BUILDS UP ON THE INSIDE OF THE AC.  ALL OF THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS BECOME DRIPPING WET.  WHEN WE TURN IT OFF A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER FALLS OUT OF THE AC ONTO THE FLOOR AND FURNITURE.  THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS WE HAS OWNED IT.   WE HAVE TAKEN IT IN FOR SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES AT THE BOAT AND RV WAREHOUSE  AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A CAUSE NOR REPAIR IT.  WE HAD WERE OUT LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF THE HEAT RAN THE AC FOR LONG PERIODS.  THE WATER DRIPPING PROBLEM PERSISTS.  I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE GET NO CONDENSATION ON ANY OF THE SURFACES INSIDE THE RV ITSELF.      THIS DEFECT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.  THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BECOMES SOAK PRESENTING A SERIOUS SHOCK HAZARD AS WELL AS A FIRE HAZARD.   HOW TO WE FIX THIS ISSUE.",
