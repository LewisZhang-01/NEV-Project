This and the driver could not get the vehicle into gear.  The driver then reached down and pulled the clutch up from the flor and was able to resume some clutch function.  No Malfunction indicator or engine light was visible.  Dealer serviced the vehicle indicating a P08A8 code set after incident. Vehicle repair order/invoice 382676 Ewald Chevrolet Buick. 36833 E Wisconsin Avenue, Oconomowoc, WI 53066 262-567-5555.  When I picked the vehicle up, I couldn't leave with it because when I depressed the clutch pedal the clutch engaged/disengaged all the way depressed or at the floor.  The dealer replaced Part #55505687 PIPE, and 19353126 Fluid.   After driving the vehicle a few miles I called the dealer and asked them to open a case with Chevrolet because the clutch system did not feel the same.  Inconsistent engage/disengage point of the clutch.  While awaiting their return call I experienced a complete loss of clutch function again, similar to the original case pedal stuck to floor, and manually had to lift clutch pedal to regain some clutch function.  This happened while driving/shifting in traffic, after pulling up the clutch the engine light lit.  Returned it to dealer",

        "summary": "I got my vehicle through a local dealership in town, in July of 2020 and only a couple months later my problems started. The vehicle started to vibrate violently and almost jerk back and forth on its own whenever I would drive it. And whenever I did come to a complete stop and accelerate the vehicle would hesitate a bit, it felt like I would have to really force it in order to keep driving. That same feeling would occur whenever I would have to drive on the highway it felt like I was pushing really hard on the gas in order to move. Which lead to my stability track message to appear on the dash as well as the check engine light. Then finally one day while I was driving and making a right turn to exit a shopping center my vehicle just stopped out of nowhere. I was unable to drive I tried putting it in neutral and reversing but nothing worked. I couldn't even take my keys out the ignition or turn off the vehicle I was completely stuck casing traffic on a busy street until what felt like five minutes later, I was able to turn it on and off and drive home.    I then took my vehicle to the local Chevy dealership where they kept my car for a week even though no work was done to it. They wanted me to let them take apart my engine to determine what the problem was, and I was advised by multiple sources including my vehicle warranty to not let them do a tear down. The service consultant said they couldn't find a reason why my vehicle just stopped on me and blew it off as nothing.   I then took it to a local mechanic in town where they replaced my air filter, spark plugs, and did a mass air flow clean. However only days later my check engine light appeared again along with the message to service the stability track. The jerking, vibrating feeling is still present when I drive also now whenever I turn on my vehicle.",

Then within a short period of time, some 30 minutes, the engine warning light activity (steady). All of this happened shortly after the 3-year warranty expired although I was having some engine roughness a few days before three years. Made an appointment at the Chevy dealership and the issue was diagnosed to a misfire on cylinder #1. Apparently, the insulator around the center electrode of the spark plug separated and slipped down. After a bit of research and asking the dealer for Chevy TSB #PIP5657D, NHTSA TSB #10201263, I was startled to find this is a somewhat frequent-enough problem affecting a number of GM models using 1.4L engine as used in my Cruze. I had a forthright conversation with Chevy dealer that this was a warranty issue as my OnStar alerted me to an emissions system malfunction. I also called GM and ACDelco, the spark plug manufacturer, and they claimed nothing or no issues. This is a safety concern to me. Paid almost $400 to have four spark plugs replaced at 3-years and only 7,000 miles; ACDelco warrants the spark plugs for 7-years or 100,000 miles!. Unacceptable.",

I WENT THROUGH A SMALL PUDDLE OF WATER AND MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUTDOWN AND WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE. I HAD IT TOWED TO CRAIN CHEVROLET WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS BOUGHT. THE GM CERTIFIED MECHANIC CALLED US HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY OPENED SATURDAY MORNING AND SAID THAT THE ENGINE WAS SEIZED AND THE ONLY WAY HE FOUND THAT OUT WAS JUST STARTING THE VEHICLE UP  WITHOUT LOOKING @ THE VEHICLE FIRST. MY HUSBAND AND I WENT UP THERE SATURDAY AFTERNOON JUST TO ASK IF WE COULD TAKE A PEEK AT IT NONE OF THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN APART AND HE WAS WRONG ON THREE DIFFERENT THINGS HE TOLD ME AND I WAS ABLE TO PROVE HIM WRONG ON THE SPOT HE JUST CHANGED TOPIC AND LOOK THE OTHER WAY I JUST THINK THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON HERE. I BELIEVE IF THE PROPER DIAGNOSTICS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE VEHICLE BEFORE HE JUST STARTED UP THE PROBLEM MAY HAVE BEEN FIXED BUT WITH GM CERTIFIED MACANIC JUST STARTING UP MY VEHICLE COULD HAVE FORCED EVEN MORE WATER INTO THE ENGINE AND PRETTY MUCH MADE IT DO WHAT IT DID. WE MADE A CLAIM ON DECEMBER 1ST WITH FARM BUREAU & MADE A CLAIM WITH THE GM SENIOR ADVISOR  ON THE SAME DATE. THE INSURANCE ADJUSTER JUST PRETTY MUCH WENT OUT THERE AND TOLD HIM TO JUST TEAR THE VEHICLE APART AND FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT DIDN'T ASK IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT IT DONE OR NOT AND NOW ALL THE SUDDEN IT'S ALL TAKEN APART AND TOTALED OUT WE'RE STUCK WITH THE DEPRECIATION VALUE AND DEDUCTABLE AND NO VEHICLE. SENIOR ADVISOR FROM GM JUST GOT BACK TO US TODAY ON THE DEC. 4TH, DALEESA WAS SUPPOSED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE DEALERSHIP (CRAIN) AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON WITH MY VEHICLE,  INSTEAD DALEESA NEGLECTED TO CONTACT ME OR MY HUSBAND.
