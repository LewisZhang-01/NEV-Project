STILL WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CHRYSLER 300 NEW IT CAME WITH THE PROTECTION GROUP OPTION! THE THING THAT IS IN THIS OPTION THAT IS OF CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT IT COME WITH THE SIDE IMPACT AND SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS! WHEN THIS CAR HAD THE TAKATA IN THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER AIRBAGS THEN IT IS LOGICAL THAT THE FACTORY WOULD HAVE TAKATA SIDE AIRBAGS FOR THE SIDE IMPACT AND CURTAIN AIRBAGS WHEN THE CAR WAS MADE! I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND STILL THE OWNER OF THIS CAR! I DO NOT WANT ANY TAKATA AIRBAGS IN THIS CAR. NOW THAT TAKATA HAS FILED BANKRUPTCY THAT MAKE IT AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM! I DID CONTACT CHRYSLER AND THEIR DEALER. THE FIRST TIME THEY WOULD NOT HELP WITH TELLING ME IF THOSE AIRBAGS WERE MADE BY TAKATA. ON THE SECOND TIME THE DEALER WILL TAKE ONE APART TO SEE IF IT IS TAKATA BUT IT WOULD COST $384.00! ONE MORE TIME NO ACCIDENT NOW OR IN THE PAST REASON FOR THIS CONTACT THROUGH THIS IS BECAUSE I SAW NO WHERE ELSE TO DO IT. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO HAVE TO REACH SOME NUMBER BEFORE DOING ANYTHING FOR A RECALL. THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT CAN SHOW FALSE RESULTS.

THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION. I HAVE TRIED ALL DIFFERENT HEARTER / DEFROSTER SETTINGS AND NOTHING WORKS. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY HAVE BEEN NO HELP. THEY SET UP AND APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALER FOR ME BUT THEY OFFERED NO HELP AT ALL.  I CALLED THEM BACK AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SOMEONE CONTACT ME BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.",

I KNOW THIS PROBLEM USUALLY HAPPENS ON SHORT DRIVING DISTANCES BUT HERE IS THAT ONE OCCURRENCE WHERE IT HAPPENED WHEN ENGINE WAS AT FULL OPERATING TEMPERATURE. IT STARTING MISS FIRING WHILE DRIVING AND BY THE TIME WE COULD GET TO THE SHOULDER TO STOP IT WAS BLOWING SMOKE LIKE CRAZY. THE CAR HAD 127,000 MILES ON IT BUT TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS IT WASN'T FROM LACK MAINTENANCE. I LOVE CARS AND TAKE EXTREMELY WELL CARE OF MINE. WHEN I PULLED THE VALVE COVER TO REMOVE THE HEAD IT WAS SO CLEAN IN THE VALVE TRAIN THAT EVEN MY FRIEND WHO IS TRIPLE MASTER ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC SAID, \" [XXX] THAT'S ONE OF CLEANEST ENGINES HE HAD EVER SEEN. AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT MANY DODGE AND CHRYSLER VEHICLE OWNERS HAVE HAD THE VERY SAME ISSUE, MAYBE JUST ANOTHER CYLINDER WHERE VALVE SEATS HAVE JUST DROPPED. TO MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S THE CHOICE IN MATERIAL THEY USED IN THE SEAT ITSELF AND THEN PRESSING IT INTO AN ALUMINUM HEAD IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. DIFFERENT METALS HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO HEAT WHERE ONE METAL SUCH AS ALUMINUM WILL HEAT FASTER THAN THEN THE METAL USED IN THE VALVE SEAT. CAUSING VALVE SEATS TO COME LOOSE AND DROP INTO THE CYLINDER CHAMBER CAUSING CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN ENGINES. HOW CAN THIS NOT BE RECALLED BY THE MANUFACTURER WHEN IT IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I'M STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THIS CAR AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT $5000.00 TO GET A REMANUFACTURED LONG BLOCK AND THEN PAYING TO HAVE IT INSTALLED. I FEEL THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR VEHICLES THAT HAVE DROPPED VALVE SEATS. THERE'S NO WARNING AS TO WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN BUT REST ASSURED IF YOU OWN A 2003 TO 2008 5.7 HEMI CHANCES ARE IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TOO.

WHEN WE ASKED WHAT THAT WAS WE WERE NEVER TOLD AND KEPT BEING TOLD THE SERVICE BULLETIN WAS DENIED DUE TO A SALES CODE, BUT THEY WOULD NOT TELL US WHAT THAT WAS AND THERE IS NO SUCH SALES CODE MENTIONED ON ANY OF THE PAPERWORK AND THE SERVICE BULLETIN DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY SALES CODE.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF DOUBLE TALK SO IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE REIMBURSED.  WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED THAT THE REQUEST WAS DENIED.   WE ALSO HAD IGNITION PROBLEMS PER CHRYSLER RECALL # P57.

UPON ARRIVAL, I INFORMED THEM OF WHAT THE ISSUE WAS, AND WAS TOLD I WOULD BE WAITING UPWARDS OF 3 HOURS TO HAVE IT COMPLETED AND EVEN IF THEY FOUND THAT THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE RECALL, WHICH I WAS TOLD IT MOST LIKELY WAS, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO, AS THERE WERE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THEY COULD NOT TELL ME AN APPROXIMATE DATE WHEN THE REPLACEMENT PARTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE.   I DID NOT WAIT THE 3 HOURS TO HAVE THE DIAGNOSTIC DONE.    I AM NERVOUS TO DRIVE THE CAR, AS NOW THAT I AM HAVING AN ISSUE AND KNOWING THAT THERE COULD BE MORE ISSUES RELATED TO THE IGNITION SWITCH RECALL (POSSIBLE SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING, ETC. ETC.).  I KNOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER 2008 CHRYSLER 300 OWNERS THAT ARE IN THE SAME POSITION.  THIS RECALL IS TAKING TOO LONG TO START RESOLVING, AND AT LEAST FOR MY PART IN IT, I HAVE CONTACTED A FAMILY LAWYER AND RELAYED THE INFORMATION, IN THE EVENT THAT I AM HURT OR KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT RELATED TO THIS SAFETY RECALL.  I CALLED THE VEHICLE SAFETY HOTLINE AND WAS GIVEN THE REFERENCE # [XXX] FOR FILING A COMPLAINT.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

THIS INCIDENT WAS FURTHER EXASPERATED BY THE FACT THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN IN & OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP (PRESTIGE IN LAS VEGAS) MARCH, APRIL, MAY & JUNE OF 2014 FOR SEVERAL ISSUES AND A LOT OF THEM HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH TEMPERATURE SENSORS, GAUGES, WATER LEAKAGE, ETC.

AT ONE POINT, THEY HAD MY CAR FOR 33 DAYS TRYING TO FIND THE PROBLEM!!      HAVING THE HEATING CORE WHERE IT IS AND HAVING IT BLOW THE HOT FLUID OUT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE FROM UNDER THE DASH IS THE MOST LUDICROUS THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

REPLACED FUSES AND RELAYS AS RECOMMENDED PER DEALER TECH, STILL WIPERS WILL NOT WORK    I HAVE SPENT OVER 500$ IN THESE REPAIRS AND STILL MY WIPERS ARE NOT WORKING.

I HAD TO DRIVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILES ON ICY AND WINDY WYOMING ROADS WHICH PROVED TO BE QUITE SCARY IN THE 300 WITH ESP.  SINCE I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE OF MY OWN WITH THIS FEATURE, IT TOOK A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE CAR DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD, EVEN AT FAIRLY SLOW SPEEDS.  THESE CARS SHOULD HAVE A HUGH RED WARNING STICKER ON THE DASH TO WARN PROSPECTIVE DRIVERS THAT THIS FEATURE IS NOT SAFE TO USE IN THE WIND AND ON ICE.
