WENT TO DRIVER SIDE POWER SLIDING DOOR, OPENED, CHILDREN ENTERED PASSENGER COMPARTMENT, AND UPON CLOSING DOOR THIS CABLE SNAPPED, BUT DIDN'T BIND ELECTRIC MOTOR UNTIL THE DOOR HAD FULLY CLOSED, CAUSING THE DOOR TO BE \"LOCKED IN PLACE\" IN THE CLOSED POSITION.  TRAVELED HOME AND CHILDREN EXITED VEHICLE THROUGH FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOORS.  THE CABLES WERE CUT BETWEEN THE ELECTRIC DOOR MOTOR AND THE \"C POST\" TO GET THE DOORS \"UNLOCKED\" AND ALLOW FOR MANUAL OPERATION.  EXAMINATION OF SNAPPED CABLES REVEALED REMOVAL OF CABLE INSULATION (LIKELY DUE TO FRICTION/ABRASION), WHICH EXPOSED THE STRANDED METAL CABLE TO THE ENVIRONMENT, CAUSING SEVERE CORROSION AND EVENTUAL FAILURE OF THE METAL CABLE.  ONLINE RESEARCH REVEALED MANY OTHER 2008 AND NEWER TOYOTA SIENNA OWNERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS, TO THE POINT WHERE A FACEBOOK PAGE HAS BEEN CREATED REGARDING THE ISSUE HTTPS://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/TOYOTA-SIENNA-FAULTY-POWER-SLIDING-DOORS-233250320033754/.  FURTHER RESEARCH REVEALED THAT TOYOTA HAS A WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT FOR THIS PROBLEM (NO: POL12-02), BUT IT ONLY APPLIES TO 2004-2007 MODEL YEARS.  WHATEVER CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN BY TOYOTA BEGINNING IN 2008 OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT REMEDIED THE PROBLEM.  THE POWER SLIDING DOOR ASSEMBLY REQUIRED TO REPAIR THESE DOORS COSTS $500 PER DOOR (PART NUMBERS 69631-08030 AND 69641-08030).  TO HAVE A DEALER MAKE THIS REPAIR COSTS $1,000 PER DOOR ($500 FOR THE PART AND $500 FOR LABOR).",

I WAS TOLD THAT THE CABLE WAS BROKEN AND THAT A NEW WHEEL AND TIRE WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE TOYOTA CUSTOMER CENTER AND AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS AND FAILURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO RETURN CALLS WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LOSS OF THE TIRE WAS DUE TO THE FAULTY SPARE TIRE CARRIER CABLE BUT THAT THEY ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE CABLE. IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS WAS COMPROMISED BY THE SPARE TIRE FALLING OFF AND ALL THE COMPANY ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY FOR IS THE CARRIER CABLE.

ON 8/26/14, MY SPARE TIRE WAS RELOCATED TO THE LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT OF MY VAN WHICH RENDERED THE AREA UNUSABLE FOR FOLDING THE REAR SEATS DOWN TO USE THAT AREA FOR TRANSPORTING LARGER ITEMS, ETC!  I CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES WITH MY LOCAL DEALER REGARDING A PERMANENT SOLUTION/REPAIR AND WAS TOLD THEY HAD NOT YET RECEIVED NOTICE OF AND/OR REPAIR PARTS FOR THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEM.ON 11/20/14, I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER AND SPOKE, AT LENGTH, WITH A REPRESENTATIVE WHO STATED THAT THEY HAD BEEN RECEIVING NUMEROUS CALLS REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF SEVERAL MEETINGS REGARDING THE ISSUE BUT NO RESOLUTION AS YET AND NO IDEA WHEN A RESOLUTION WILL OCCUR.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT BY NOW, IF THE SITUATION IS BEING ACTIVELY WORKED ON, AN ACCEPTABLE REPAIR WOULD BE AVAILABLE! I AM FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED WITH TOYOTA FOR THEIR SEEMING INDIFFERENCE TO THOSE OF US WAITING FOR THEIR ACTION ON THIS MATTER.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMPT ATTENTION TO THIS SITUATION.  *TR",

WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING INTO THE GARAGE SHE SMELLED AND SAW OIL FUME COMING OUT OF THE HOOD. SHE THOUGHT THE CAR WAS GOING TO CATCH FIRE AND GRABBED THE KIDS AND GOT OUT OF THE VAN AS QUICKLY AS SHE CAN. I GOT HER CALL AND RUSHED HOME FROM WORK. IT TURNED OUT THERE WAS A SUDDEN FAILURE OF A OIL COOLING PIPE ON THE ENGINE. ALL OF THE ENGINE OIL HAD ALMOST LEAKED OUT (THERE WAS MAYBE ABOUT QUARTER OF INCH SHOWING ON THE DIP STICK). AFTER WE TOWED THE CAR TO THE DEALER, WE FOUND OUT THE OIL HAD LEAKED FROM AN ENGINE COOLER PIPE WHICH WAS POORLY DESIGNED AND OVER TIME IT COULD DEVELOP A SLOW SEEP LEAK OR IN OUR CASE FAILED IN A SUDDEN BURST AND CAUSED THE OIL TO LEAK OUT LIKE A RUNNING FAUCET. WE WERE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT OCCURRED JUST WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING THE VAN IN OUR SUBDIVISION. TOYOTA HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS ISSUE LAST SUMMER BUT DIDN'T HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS. IF IT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AND WE DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE ENGINE LIGHT, THE ENGINE MAY BURN OR WORSE IT COULD SEIZE AND CAUSE ACCIDENT. AFTER A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE WEB, I FOUND OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE. TOYOTA ACTUALLY HAD A RECALL OTHER MODELS OF CARS FOR THE SAME ISSUE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T RECALL THE 2008 SIENNA AND THEY SHOULD HAVE. I WANT TO REPORT THIS AND HOPEFULLY FORCE TOYOTA TO START RECALL ON THIS ISSUE FOR ALL IMPACTED MODELS SO OTHERS WON'T HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS AND AVOID POTENTIAL ACCIDENTS. THANKS.  *TR",

FOLLOWING UP WITH THE DIAGONOSTICS ON THE VEHICLE IT WAS DETECTED THAT THE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED. SINCE I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE AS CERTIFIED USED FROM TOYOTA IN 03/2010 I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THIS PART IS COVERED BUT TO MY FRUSTRATION - TOYOTA SAID THE FUEL PUMP IS CLASSIFIED AS AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND UNFORTUNATELY OTHER THAN THEIR HYBRID MODELS IT IS NOT COVERED BY ANY TYPE WARRANTY. UPON RESEARCHING MULTIPLE WEBSITES, CHAT FORUMS, AND AMONG REGISTERED TOYOTA OWNERS IT CAME TO MY UNDERSTANDING/CONCLUSION THAT THE TOYOTA SIENNA MODELS FROM 2007 TO 2010 HAD NUMEROUS FUEL PUMP, PULLEYS, AND BRAKE DRUM ISSUES. THE VEHICLES AFFECTED HAD TOTAL MILES RANGING FROM 20K TO 130K. NEW VEHICLES WITH FAILING FUEL PUMPS AND NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY - SHOCKING.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT A FUEL PUMP NO VEHICLES CAN RUN AND IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THAT AUTOMAKERS CLASSIFY IT AS AN ELECTRICAL ITEM AND THE NHTSA SADLE AGREES WITH IT. THIS REPAIR COSTED ME OVER $600 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. IF  I WERE TO USE THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR PARTS AND SERVICE IT WOULD HAVE COSTED ME OVER $900 ( VIA 3 ESTIMATES FROM DEALERSHIPS) THROUGH THIS LETTER I AM KINDLY REQUESTING AN INVESTIGATION TO THE FUEL PUMP ISSUES FOR TOYOTA SIENNA FROM MODEL YEAR 2007 ONWARDS SO A PROPER WARRANTY COVERAGE, WARNINGS CAN BE PROVIDED TO REGISTERED OWNERS.  *TR",

HOW CAN W BE SO CERTAIN? MY WIFE AND I HAVE PARKED IN THIS PARKING SPOT (LOCATED IN OUR APARTMENT COMPLEX) HUNDREDS OF TIMES.  TO PARK IN THIS PARKING SPOT YOU FIRST HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN AT A STOP SIGN. THIS STOP SIGN IS ABOUT 30 - 40 FEET FROM THE PARKING SPOT, WHICH REQUIRES THAT YOU MAKE A SHARP RIGHT TURN.

THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE OIL PRESSURE LINE -VALVE COVER VARIABLE TIMING-ON TOP OF MOTOR TO RIGHT ON PASSENGER SIDE HAD BURST. PART OF THE LINE IS RUBBER AND THAT PART HAD RUPTURED AND ALL THE OIL HAD BLOWN OUT OF THE ENGINE. MY OIL LIGHT DID NOT COME ON AT ANY TIME NOR DID MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.

        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2008 TOYOTA SIENNA THAT I BELIEVE HAS A SAFETY ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN COLD WEATHER. THE EXTERIOR SWITCH THAT ALLOWS THE REAR HATCH TO OPEN IS NOT FUNCTIONAL IN COLD WEATHER DUE TO A MATERIAL MALFUNCTION. I NOTICED THAT DURING WARMER WEATHER, THE RUBBER SEAL OVER THIS EXTERIOR SWITCH HAD BECOME SOFT AND GUMMY. OVER TIME, THE RUBBER SEEPED BETWEEN THE SWITCH HOUSING AND THE SWITCH BUTTON. AS THE WEATHER BECAME COLD, THE RUBBER HAS HARDENED AROUND THE SWITCH BUTTON AND THE EXTERIOR SWITCH IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. THE ONLY WAY I CAN OPEN THE REAR HATCH IN COLD WEATHER IS TO OPEN A FRONT DOOR AND USE THE INTERIOR SWITCH TO OPEN THE REAR HATCH. MY CONCERN IS IF WE WERE TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT DURING THE COLD MONTHS AND THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE COULD GET ACCESS TO THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE IS THROUGH THE REAR HATCH, IT COULD NOT BE DONE BECAUSE THE EXTERIOR SWITCH ON THE REAR HATCH WOULD BE SEIZED PREVENTING ACCESS. IT IS VERY ALARMING WHEN I THINK OF MY ENTIRE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY MY 15 YO, MY 3 YR, AND MY 6 MO, BEING INSIDE OF THIS VAN AND PEOPLE NOT GAINING ACCESS TO THE INSIDE TO HELP THEM DUE TO INJURIES, FIRE, WATER HAZARDS, ETC... I OWN A 2005 TOYOTA 4RUNNER AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE THE SAME SWITCH. HOWEVER, THE RUBBER ON THE SWITCH IS PERFECTLY FINE AND FUNCTIONS NORMALLY. THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A MATERIAL CHANGE ALLOWING THE RUBBER TO SOFTEN RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD DURING THE COLD MONTHS. I SPOKE TO OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND SAID THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE. INITIALLY I THOUGHT THE PREVIOUS OWNER APPLIED A SOLVENT OR SOMETHING TO SOFTEN THE RUBBER. AS I RESEARCHED MORE ON THE INTERNET, THIS ISSUE APPLIES TO MANY TOYOTA VEHICLES, WITH MODELS INCLUDING THE SIENNA AND THE 4RUNNER. THE EARLIEST MODEL YEAR THAT I CAN FIND FOR EITHER MODEL IS 2007.  *TR",

THIS IS THE SAME PIECE ON THE TWO VEHICLES. THEY THEN STATE THAT THIS HOSE WITH AN AVERAGE FAILS AT 50-60000MILES. THEY THEN STATED THAT THIS HOSE IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THIS HOSE BURSTING CAN CAUSE ENGINE DAMAGE AND IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THIS RUBBER OIL HOSE ON ALL VEHICLES. THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS A BAD PIECE WHEN TALKING WITH THEM. ALSO IF IT WERE TO FAIL THEY THEN WILL STATE THAT SINCE THIS HOSE CAUSED THE ENGINE ISSUES THEY WILL NOT COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY.

ALTHOUGH SEVERAL ISSUES ARE PRESENT, I DID TRY TO DESCRIBE THEM INTO 3 DISTINCT PROBLEMS.    2008 TOYOTA SIENNA LE AWD, BEARING   STEERING ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE:    1. THE VEHICLE STEERING WHEEL PHYSICALLY TURNS TO THE RIGHT, WHILE BRAKING.     2. STEERING WHEEL FAILS TO CENTER PROPERLY AT ALL TIMES.    3. STEERING WHEEL HAS TO BE HELD TO LEFT TO KEEP TRACKING STRAIGHT.    THE VEHICLE STEERING WHEEL PHYSICALLY TURNS TO THE RIGHT, WHILE BRAKING. THE GREATEST EFFECT / TURNING IS OBSERVED AS THE VEHICLE'S SPEED DECREASES. THE GREATEST EFFECT / TURNING IS ALSO OBSERVED AS THE VEHICLE'S SPEED DECREASES AND THE VEHICLE IS TRAVERSING DOWN A STEEP GRADIENT.     THIS OCCURS IF I DRIVE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROAD, WITH THE CENTER OF THE ROAD CROWN, CENTERED ON THE VEHICLE AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHERE A VEHICLE MUST LAWFULLY TRAVEL. CONVERSELY, IF I DRIVE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD / OR THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD CROWN, THE VEHICLE DOES NOT ADVERSELY PULL TO THE LEFT. IT WAS NOTED BY THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS DUE TO ROAD CROWN.    THIS ISSUE PROVIDES A FALSE SENSE OF STEERING, ESPECIALLY IN THE SNOW, AS IT IS SOMETIMES BELIEVED THAT THE ROAD CONDITIONS ARE CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO TRACK RIGHT, AND OVERCOMPENSATION IS USUALLY APPLIED.      VEHICLE PULLS OR DRIFTS TO THE RIGHT WHILE DRIVING. ONCE THE VEHICLE STARTS PULLING / DRIFTING, IT CONTINUES ABRUPTLY.      DRIVING ON LONGER TRIPS 2-3 HOURS DOES CAUSE ARM STRAIN, FROM CONSTANT CORRECTING OF THE STEERING WHEEL ATTEMPTING TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO TRACK STRAIGHT.    I DID FILE A LEMON LAW CLAIM AGAINST TOYOTA REGARDING THESE DEFECTS, AND RECEIVED COMPENSATION. THEREAFTER I DID NOT TAKE TO DEALERSHIP, AS TOYOTA SIMPLY CANNOT REPAIR THE ISSUES. *TR",

THIS COMMERCIAL DOES NOT TELL YOU THE PRONES OF IT AND I EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE A 2008 TOYOTA SIENNA ALL-WHEEL DRIVE  AND IT HAS THE ELECTRONIC INDICATOR OF LOW AIR PRESSURE. IT CAME ON ONCE IN A WHILE AND JUST ADDED SOME AIR. BUT LATELY IT CAME ON MORE FREQUENTLY AND I TOOK THE VAN TO THE TOYOTA DEALER IN LA CRESCENTA CA., WHERE I BOUGHT THE   VAN, FOR INSPECTION. THEY TOLD ME THERE IS A NAIL IN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE AND THIS TYPE OF THE RAN FLAT TIRE CAN NOT BE REPAIRED. SO I HAD TO BUY A NEW   TIRE. LUCKY ENOUGH THEY COULD ORDER IT RIGHT AWAY  AND GOT THE TIRE MOUNTED THE NEXT DAY. THE DEALER COULD NOT MOUNT THE TIRE ON THE RIM AND HAD TO SEND IT TO A SPECIAL TIRE PLACE, BECAUSE THIS ARE SPECIAL RIMS, I HAVE BEEN TOLD. THE PRICE FOR THIS ONE TIRE WAS $ 269.56 INCLUDING MOUNTING, BALANCING AND SALES TAX. SINCE THIS TYPE OF A VAN WITH THIS RUN FLAT TIRES, DOES NOT COME WITH A SPARE TIRE. THEY TOLD ME, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE ONE. WHAT WILL HAPPENED, WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WILDERNESS IN THE COUNTRY. YES YOU CAN DRIVE OVER 100 MILES ON THE FLAT TIRE, BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE NEXT TOWN AND THEY HAVE TO ORDER THIS TIRE AND IT CAN TAKE DAYS BEFORE THEY GET ONE. THERE YOU WILL BE STUCK FOR A WHILE.  THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A GOOD WAY TO HAVE THIS  TIRES. IT SURE IS A MISS LEADING ADVERTISING AND A BAD EXPERIENCE. ON TAP OF IT THE TIRES HAVE NO WARRANTY.  UNHAPPY EXPERIENCED OWNER, KARL *TR",

NOT TO MENTION I HAD A COST OF $700.00 TO REPLACE EQUIPMENT THAT WASN'T FAULTY.      I WOULD LIKE TOYOTA TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MAY PERHAPS BE THE FIRST OF SEVERAL HOMELINKS TO HAVE A ISSUE AND TO MAKE CONSUMERS AWARE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL MALFUNCTION SO THEY TOO DON'T OVERHEAT AND POSSIBLY LEAD TO FIRE IN THE  MOTORS IN GARAGE.  *TR",
