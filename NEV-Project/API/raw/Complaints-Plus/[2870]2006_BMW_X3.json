IN APRIL 2018 MY WIFE WAS IN A NEAR FATAL ACCIDENT WHERE SHE HAD TO BE AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL AND WAS IN ICU FOR ALMOST 1 WEEK. THE AIRBAG IN OUR TOYOTA SIENNA SAVED HER LIFE. IN THE SPRING, I CONNECTED WITH THE LOCAL BMW DEALERSHIP, WHO REFERRED ME TO BMW NORTH AMERICA WHERE I LOGGED A COMPLAINT. I ALSO REQUESTED A LOANER UNTIL MY AIRBAG SYSTEM COULD BE REPAIRED. THEY DENIED MY REQUEST AND FOR A LOANER. THEY REFERRED ME TO THEIR WEBSITE TO READ THEIR POLICY AND SAID RECOMMENDED THAT I CALL THE LOCAL BMW DEALERSHIP FOR HELP. I ASKED THEM FOR A WRITTEN POSITION STATEMENT BUT THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE IT FOR ME. THEIR RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT TO ALLOW ANYONE TO RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT. I PURCHASED A 5-PASSENGER VEHICLE AND NOT ALLOWING ANYONE TO RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT IS NOT AN OPTION FOR MY FAMILY. I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE A FRONT-SEAT PASSENGER. NINE MONTHS IS TOO LONG FOR BMW NOT TO HAVE A REMEDY FOR SUCH A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NOT PROVIDE A LOANER AT NO CHARGE UNTIL THY HAVE A REMEDY.",

THE CAR EXCELERATED THROWING ME BACK INTO MY SEAT. I KEPT PUSHING THE BRAKE AND THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP. THE CAR WENT AIRBORNE AND EXCELERATED A SECOND TIME. I HIT A FIRE HYDRANT AND LANDED IN THE STREET. I WAS THEN ABLE TO STOP THE CAR. THE DISTANCE FROM THE PARKING STOP TO THE ROAD WAS ABOUT 20 FEET. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A BMW DEALER. BMW HAD MY CAR FOR 8 WEEKS. THEY HAD 2 DIFFERENT TECHS COME IN TO LOOK AT THE CAR. THE OUT COME WAS THAT THE BRAKES ARE FINE AND IT DID NOT HAVE ANY CODES. NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR. I TOLD THEM THAT I DIDN'T WANT THE CAR BACK. SINCE THEY DIDN'T SEE AN ISSUE I TOLD THEM I WOULD TRADE IT IN AND THEY COULD BE LIABLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE GETTING HURT. FUNNY HOW ALL OF THE SUDDEN THEY TOTALED OUT THE CAR. I ENDED UP GETTING A CONCUSSION AND WHIPLASH AND WILL BE DOCTORING FOR A WHILE. THE PERSON AT BMW THAT WAS TAKING CARE OF THIS IS MICHAEL AND HIS PHONE NUMBER IS 201-571-5820. WE WERE TOLD BY AMERICAN FAMILY INSURANCE PERSON THAT GOING AFTER BMW TO GET THE REPORTS FROM THE TECHS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE REPORTS SAY. I FEEL LIKE WE WERE GIVEN THE RUN AROUND. I WANT BMW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH SUDDEN EXCELERATION. I AM VERY ANGRY ON HOW I WAS TREATED. THEY GAVE US NO INFORMATION AND WE WERE WITHOUT A CAR FOR 7 WEEKS. THE LAST WEEK THEY FINALLY GAVE US A RENTAL. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS FOR ME.",

THE BMW SERVICE MANAGER, I TALKED TO, INDICATED THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS SIMILAR ISSUES, BUT WAS NOT AWARE HOW WIDE SPREAD THE PROBLEM IS. HIS GUESS OF WHY THIS MAY BE HAPPENING IS DUE TO DIFFERENT THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE 3 DIFFERENT METALS INVOLVED IN THE MOUNTING SYSTEM.

I HAD MY BALL JOINTS AND FRONT-END CHECKED OUT ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT FINE. I SUSPECT NOW, THAT THE THUMP SOUND IS DUE TO THE SHEARED ENGINE MOUNT BOLTS.

THE RECALL NOTICE STATES THAT THE PARTS NEEDED TO PERFORM THE REPAIR ARE SCHEDULED TO BE AVAILABLE IN MARCH 2014.  IT IS NOW MAY 6, 2014 AND BMW CUSTOMER RELATIONS HAS INDICATED THAT THE PARTS ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE ON WHEN THEY WILL BE. IT HAS NOW BEEN NEARLY 5 MONTHS SINCE RECEIVING THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE.  DURING THIS TIME I ESSENTIALLY HAVE A VEHICLE THAT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  BMW DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND PROVIDING A PROMPT RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE PLACED REPEATED CALLS INTO BMW CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND CONTINUE TO BE INFORMED THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE UNTIL THE REQUIRED PARTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE.

DEPENDING ON THE MANNER AND FREQUENCY OF THE FRONT PASSENGER'S ENTRY AND EXIT, SMALL CRACKS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE MAT. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAGS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HEAD PROTECTION SYSTEM, WILL BE DEACTIVATED AND THE AIR BAG WARNING LAMP AS WELL AS THE PASSENGER AIR BAG \"ON-OFF\" LAMP WILL BE ILLUMINATED. CONSEQUENCES: IN THIS SITUATION THE FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY EVEN IF A SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE ACCIDENT WOULD OCCUR AND OCCUPANT PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. REMEDY: DEALERS WILL REWORK THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SENSOR MAT SO THAT EXTERNAL FORCE APPLICATION TO THE SEAT DOES NOT CAUSE A CRACK TO THE MAT. THE RECALL BEGAN ON NOVEMBER 6, 2008. BMW WILL ALSO EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THESE VEHICLES TO 10 YEARS FROM FIRST REGISTRATION WITHOUT ANY MILEAGE LIMIT. OWNERS MAY CONTACT BMW AT 1-800-525-7417.

I DROVE ABOUT 100FT TO THE END OF MY STREET AND THE SMOKING WORSENED SO I DECIDED TO RETURN HOME.  I TURNED ONTO THE MAIN STREET AND DROVE AT MOST 20MPH FOR A FEW BLOCKS TO GET BACK HOME.  THE SMOKE WAS POURING OUT OF THE EXHAUST SO BADLY THAT I COULDN'T SEE OUT MY BACK WINDOW.  IT WAS BLUE/GREY COLORED.  THE CAR WAS PUTTING AND CHUGGING.  I DID NOT MAKE IT HOME.  EVENTUALLY THE CAR CHUGGED A FEW TIMES AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.  THE WARNING LIGHTS ALL LIT UP AND I LOST ALL POWER, INCLUDING POWER STEERING.  IT WAS STRANDED ACROSS A DRIVEWAY AND WOULD NOT START.  I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE, DRIVE LOCALLY AND USE PREMIUM GAS.  THERE WAS NO REASONABLE EXPLANATION TO THIS FAILURE.  I HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL BMW REPAIR SHOP AND FOUND THAT IT WAS THE \"OIL SEPARATOR\" THAT FAILED.  MY INVOICE STATES THAT IT WAS AN \"ENGINE HYDRAULIC LOCK\".  THE FAILURE OF THE \"OIL SEPARATOR\", WHICH IS CALLED A CYCLONE SEPARATOR ON MY INVOICE, CAUSED THE CAR TO FLOOD WITH OIL.  THE CYCLONE SEPARATOR AND CRANKCASE VENT HOSES WERE REPLACED.  RESEARCHING ONLINE I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH BMW, MOSTLY THE X5 MODELS.  BMW N.A. REFUSED TO ASSIST ME, MY WARRANTY EXPIRED 3 MONTHS PRIOR DUE TO THE YEAR OF THE CAR, BUT HAD NOT MET THE MILEAGE REQUIREMENT.  THE REPAIR COST $1100 AND I WAS WITHOUT A VEHICLE FOR 3 DAYS.  I ALSO HAD TO PAY $70 FOR A TOW AS BMW WOULD NOT HONOR THE ROAD ASSISTANCE.   *TR",

MY CAR IS A BMW 2006 330I WITH SPORTS SEATS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE CARS LISTED AS BEING DEFECTIVE BY YOUR DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER, BMW STATED THAT THE RECALL IS FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF AIRBAG SENSOR MATTS THAT WERE DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING AND THAT MY CAR'S MATT WAS NOT PART OF THIS BATCH. SINCE MY CAR IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THOSE UNDER THE RECALL, AND IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CARS LISTED IN YOUR REPORT, IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THE FAULTY AIRBAG SENSOR ISSUE GOES BEYOND JUST THE BATCH BMW IS CLAIMING WERE DAMAGED. EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, AND THAT SPECIFIC BATCH OF AIR BAG SENSORS WERE DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING, THEN WHAT'S TO SAY THAT MY AIR BAG SENSOR WASN'T ALSO DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING EVEN IF IT WAS PART OF ANOTHER BATCH. THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION, HOWEVER, WOULD INDICATE THAT THE SENSORS BEING DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING IS FALSE AND THAT THERE IS IN FACT A FLAW WITH THE SENSOR ITSELF. THIS IS EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT BMW PRODUCED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE SENSOR AND THAT MY SENSOR THOUGH NOT PART OF THE SO CALLED DAMAGED BATCH IS ALSO EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS. IF THE CAUSE OF THE FAULTY SENSORS WERE DUE TO BEING DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING THEN WHY NEED TO CREATE AN UPDATED VERSION. THE LOGICAL THING TO DO WOULD BE TO ENSURE THE SAFE DELIVERY OF THE SENSORS, NOT CREATE A NEW VERSION. I'VE OWNED MANY VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME FEATURE AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS. BMW CLAIMING THAT THE SYMPTOMS OF MY SENSOR HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE DAMAGED BATCH IS JUST A COINCIDENCE IS A FAR CRY. AT THE VERY LEAST A NEW INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE. THANK YOU.",
