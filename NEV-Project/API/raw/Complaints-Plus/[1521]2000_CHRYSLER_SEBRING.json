THE FIFTH TIME I TOOK THE CAR TO PEP BOYS AND THEY FOUND A SHORT IN MY BLOWER MOTOR WHICH WAS CAUSING MY RESISTOR TO SHORT OUT.  CHRYSLER SUPPLIES THE BLOWER MOTOR AFTER MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  I HAD ASKED THEM WHEN THE RESISTOR WENT OUT THE SECOND TIME IF IT COULD BE A POSSIBLE SHORT SOMEWHERE THAT WAS CAUSING THIS AND WAS TOLD THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE.  AFTER MANY THREATS I FINALLY GOT THEM TO REPLACE THE BLOWER MOTOR AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE LABOR.  THEY SAID SINCE THE CAR WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURES WARRANTY THAT IT WAS BASICALLY NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  THE SECOND PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE CAR WAS THAT THERE WAS A SHAKE WHEN YOU STEPPED ON THE BRAKES AND I HAD TO HAVE MY ROTORS TURNED.  THE THIRD PROBLEM I HAD WAS WHEN THE FUEL PUMP WENT OUT AND I HAD TO FIGHT WITH THE DEALERSHIP FOR A REPLACEMENT CAR SINCE THEY HAD MINE FOR TWO WEEKS.  THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING NOW IS THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS COMPLETELY OUT ON MY CAR.  IT WAS JUST TOWED THIS MORNING TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.  I CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER ABOUT THE CAR BEING ONLY THREE YEARS OLD AND THE TRANSMISSION BLOWING IN IT.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND IT HAS 95,000 MILES.  SO YOU?RE SAYING THAT CHRYSLER VEHICLES DO NOT LAST PAST 95,000 MILES.  THE MAN NAMED JOHNATHAN ARGUED WITH ME ON THE PHONE ABOUT HOW CHRYSLER MAKES DEPENDABLE VEHICLES.  I TOLD HIM THAT MY MOTHER?S 1991 FORD TEMPO HAS 170,000 MILES ON IT AND THE TRANSMISSION HAS NEVER WENT OUT ON THAT.  HE SAID ALL HE COULD DO WAS NOTE MY COMPLAINT AND HE HUNG UP.
