IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS THE BATTERY YOU MUST REMOVE THE FRONT TIRE AND THEN THE SHROUD THAT COVERS THE WHEEL WELL.  MY BATTERY HAS BEEN REPLACED THREE TIMES SINCE THE DATE OF PURCHASE.

DURING THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE BATTERY ON 11/22 OUR MECHANIC FOUND THAT THE BATTERY CASING THAT HOLDS THE BATTERY IN PLACE WAS TOTALLY CORRODED AND NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED.  THE CAUSE OF THIS CORROSION (ACCORDING TO MY MECHANIC) IS FROM BATTERY ACID AND OTHER ELEMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE DRIVERS SIDE FRAME OF THE CAR WAS ALSO DAMAGED/CORRODED DUE TO THE BATTERY ACID AND THAT THE FRAME WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED/REPAIRED AS WELL AND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  I SPOKE WITH CHRYSLER CORPORATION JUST PRIOR TO WRITING TO YOU AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THE VEHICLE; DESPITE THE FACT THAT I TRULY BELIEVED THAT THIS SITUATION WAS CAUSED BY EXTREMELY POOR ENGINEERING OF THE VEHICLE.

I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THE LOWER RIGHT BALL JOINT HAD LOST IT'S LUBRICATION.  THE SERVICE MANAGER INDICATED THAT SINCE THERE WASN'T A GREASE FITTING ON THE BALL JOINT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE REPAIR COULD NOT BE DONE THAT DAY AND AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE, AND HE REPLIED YES.  THE NEXT DAY , WHILE MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET (5 - 10 MPH) THE CAR COLLAPSED ONTO THE RIGHT TIRE.  WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DAMAGE I SAW THE THE TIRE ALMOST FLAT ON THE GROUND, THE DRIVESHAFT WAS OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION, THE CV JOINT WAS PULLED FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND THE BALL JOINT WAS CUT IN HALF.  THERE WAS ALSO DAMAGE TO THE FENDER OF THE CAR.  SALERNO CHRYSLER INSPECTED THE LEFT BALL JOINT AND SAID IT WAS FINE.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND A LITTLE OVER TWO MONTHS LATER THE LEFT SIDE BEGAN TO MAKE THE SAME NOISE.  I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE NOISE.  THE CAR WAS MAKING  NOISE THE NEXT DAY, AND I DECIDED TO BRING THE CAR SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I BROUGHT  THE CAR TO ANOTHER CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER AND THEY FOUND THE THE LEFT LOWER BALL JOINT WAS FAILING DUE TO LACK OF LUBRICATION.  I HAVE THAT PART IN MY POSSESION AND WOULD GLADLY SEND IT TO YOU.  MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON REPAIRS DUE TO THESE LOWER BALL JOINT FAILURES AND THEY SEEM TO BE MANUFACTURER'S PROBLEMS, NOT MY DRIVING HABITS.  THEE HAVE BEEN RECALLS FOR OTHER CHRYSLER CARS FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM, BUT NOT THE SEBRING.  I THINK THAT SOMEONE SHOULD THINK ABOUT RECALLING THE SEBRING ALSO.
