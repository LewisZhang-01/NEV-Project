ON APRIL 13, 2015, MY DRIVER SIDE SEAT BELT DID NOT RETRACT, AND THEREFORE WHEN I STEPPED OUT OF CAR, THE SEAT BELT WAS LODGED BETWEEN THE DOOR, AND THE FRAME OF CAR. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH MIDDLE PASSENGER BACK SEAT. THE SEAT BELT IN THE BACK CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RETRACT.  I CALLED ACURA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE SEAT BELT HAS A WARRANTY UP TO 15 YEARS AND OR 150,000 MILES. MY CAR IS COVERED, BUT WHEN I TOOK IT TO DEALER ON APRIL 17, 2015, THAT TO REMOVE THE SEAT BELT THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR HAS TO BE BROKEN, AND THAT THESE COSTS WILL BE CHARGED TO ME. MY ACURA 2007 RDX IS ALSO SCHEDULED FOR INSPECTION, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A FAILURE.   PLEASE ASSIST ME WITH THIS SAFETY ISSUE. THANK YOU.      *TR",

I WAS TOLD IT WAS CAUSED BY RUNNING OVER SOMETHING IN THE ROAD (WHICH I DON'T RECALL DOING).  8/22/08 NOTICED ANOTHER TIRE WAS LOW ON AIR. THERE WAS A SMALL HOLE IN THE TREAD AREA SO THE TIRE WAS REPAIRED AT LOCAL SHOP.  AGAIN WAS TOLD I RAN OVER SOMETHING.  ON NOVEMBER,  EXPERIENCED BLOWOUT WITH A LARGE HOLE IN THE SIDEWALL WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEED ON I-70 IN MARYLAND.  BROUGHT CAR TO ACURA AGAIN AND WAS TOLD I WAS JUST UNLUCKY AND AGAIN, RAN OVER \"SOMETHING\" IN THE ROAD.  AT THIS POINT, I HAD NOW REPLACED TWO TIRES AND HAD A THIRD REPAIRED.  ON DECEMBER 5, I DROVE TO PENNSYLVANIA.  THE CAR SAT PARKED ALL DAY.  AT NIGHT, WHEN I WENT OUT, THE REMAINING TWO ORIGINAL TIRES WERE BOTH FLAT.  I HAD TO STAY OVERNIGHT AND WAIT UNTIL MORNING. I FOUND A LOCAL TIRES PLUS AN PURCHASED FOUR NEW BRIDGESTONE TIRES AS I DID NOT FEEL THE MICHELINS WERE SAFE.  IN 17 MONTHS, WITH 22,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, I HAVE PURCHASED 6 TIRES AND SPENT OVER $1400.  I DRIVE MOSTLY HIGHWAY ON WELL MAINTAINED AND HEAVILY TRAVELED ROADS.  I DON'T SPEED OR DRIVE RECKLESSLY.  THE VEHICLE IS KEPT IN MY GARAGE OVERNIGHT AND HAD BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY AT ACURA.  IN OVER 30 YEARS OF DRIVING, I  HAVE ONLY HAD ONE OTHER FLAT TIRE.  I HAVE HAD 4 IN 7 MONTHS.  ALL 4 OF THE ORIGINAL  MICHELIN TIRES GAVE OUT.  I AM FORTUNATE THAT I WAS NOT INJURED BUT I AM CONVINCED THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS. *TR",
