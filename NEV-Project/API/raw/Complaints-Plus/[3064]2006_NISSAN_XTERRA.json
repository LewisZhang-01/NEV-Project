ALTHOUGH THEY CORRECTED THE PROBLEM IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL YEARS, THEY NEVER CONTACTED OR NOTIFIED THE AFFECTED OWNERS OF THE PROBLEM THAT UNLESS THESE GUIDES ARE REPLACED THEY WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAINS WEARING OUT THE GUIDES CAUSING THE SECONDARY CHAINS THEMSELVES TO RUN METAL ON METAL AGAINST THE TENSIONERS.  BECAUSE OF THIS CONTINUED WEAR, THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAINS MAY FAIL AT ANY TIME THE ENGINE IS ON WITHOUT WARNING AND DESTROY THE ENGINE. NISSAN ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE PROBLEM BUT FAILED TO NOTIFY OWNERS THAT AS THE VEHICLES APPROACH APPROXIMATELY 100,000 MILES OR MORE, THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAINS MAY FAIL.  I HAVE ATTACHED PHOTOS OF THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAIN TENSIONERS REMOVED FROM MY VEHICLE WHICH SHOW THE PLASTIC GUIDE ON ONE NEARLY COMPLETELY WORN THROUGH, AND THE OTHER ONE BROKEN WITH ONLY HALF OF THE PLASTIC GUIDE STILL IN PLACE ON THE TENSIONER.   I ALSO INCLUDED MY REPAIR RECEIPT FOR THE $2,123.40 REPAIR.  FINALLY, I INCLUDED THE NISSAN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS PROBLEM.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THEY RECALLED THE V8 ENGINES WITH THIS TYPE OF ISSUE, BUT NOT THE V6 ENGINES (I HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT HOWEVER,)  NISSAN SHOULD IMMEDIATELY ISSUE A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES AND COVER THE COST OF REPAIRS ALREADY MADE BY CONSUMERS.",

PLEASE KNOW WE ARE ALSO A CURRENT OWNER OF A NISSAN TITAN AND ARE LOYAL TO THE NISSAN BRAND.    IN 2011 THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION WITH ROUGHLY 50,000 MILES FAILED DUE TO A FAULTY DESIGN ASSOCIATED WITH A COOLER ASSEMBLY. THIS TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT NO COST TO US BY LIBERTY NISSAN LOCATED IN HANOVER, PENNSYLVANIA.    AFTER SAID TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED, WE STARTED TO NOTICE A CONSTANT WHINING THAT WE THOUGHT WAS SOMEHOW ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEW TRANSMISSION. WE RETURNED TO LIBERTY NISSAN TO HAVE THEM INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE AND IT WAS THEIR DETERMINATION THAT THE NOISE WAS DUE TO WORE OUT TIMING BELT SPROCKETS. WE EXPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS ANOMALY HAD NOT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW TRANSMISSION AS IT WAS AND REMAINS QUITE NOTICEABLE. HOWEVER, THIS EXPLANATION SEEMED TO FALL UPON DEAF EARS.      SUBSEQUENTLY LIBERTY NISSAN INFORMED US THAT IF WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE COSTS WOULD BE ROUGHLY $1,200.00 DOLLARS. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD NOT AFFORD AT THE TIME AND FURTHERMORE FELT THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD OCCUR UNDER NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR FOR A VEHICLE WITH ONLY 50,000 MILES. TO THIS DAY WE REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF THIS DIAGNOSIS. WE ARE NOW LEFT WITH A VEHICLE THAT LOST ITS APPEAL DUE TO THIS CONSTANT, AGGRESSIVE WHINING INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IN THE PAST DREW POSITIVE ATTENTION FROM ONLOOKERS AND PASSERSBY'S FOR ITS APPEARANCE.

THEY ASKED IF I HAD OTHER ISSUES AND I TOLD THEM THAT MY ENGINE SOMETIMES SOUNDED LIKE AN RC CAR. THEY OFFERED TO LOOK INTO IT, CALLED THIS AFTERNOON AFTER COMPLETING WORK ON SENSOR AND ECM RELAY TO INFORM ME THAT MY TIMING CHAINS WERE SHOT AND IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT. DID SOME MORE RESEARCH AND FOUND THIS IS A FREQUENT ISSUE IN NISSAN CARS, DECIDED TO FILE A REPORT.  *TR",

NISSAN ALSO NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL BC I'M NOT THE ONLY 06 XTERRA OWNER TO HAVE THIS ISSUE. PLEASE HELP ME, I HAVE A 1 YR. OLD DAUGHTER AND I NEED MY CAR FIXED AND DON'T HAVE 5100 DOLLARS TO FIX IT MYSELF. THANK YOU  *TR",

I INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE PROBLEM WORSENED. ON OCTOBER 30TH I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO RICART NISSAN. AN INITIAL CHECK SHOWED A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IN THE TRANSMISSION FLUID, THE SERVICE PERSON ACCUSED ME OF PUTTING OIL IN THE TRANSMISSION AND STATED THAT NISSAN WOULD SEND THE FLUID TO A LABORATORY FOR TESTING. APPROX 6 DAYS LATER I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP STATING NISSAN WOULD REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FREE OF CHARGE. AT 60,000 MILES OR A MONTH OR SO LATER MY VEHICLE WARRANTY EXPIRED. THE VEHICLE NEVER REALLY RAN CORRECTLY AFTER THAT; HEAVY SHIFTING, VEHICLE WOULD NOT WARM UP WHEN STATIONARY. I MADE SEVERAL FOLLOW UP CALLS TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT EACH TIME I WAS ADVISED THAT VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, OR OVER 60,000 MILES. AT THAT POINT I JUST DEALT WITH THE ROUGH RUNNING ROUGH SHIFTING VEHICLE.   MOVE AHEAD TO MAY 2014. ONCE AGAIN THE VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION SLIPPED WHILE TURNING ALMOST CAUSING ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED, MY 2006 NISSAN XTERRA IS THE 4X4, AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION & HAD AROUND 99,950 MILES AT THE TIME. THE INCIDENT PUT MYSELF, MY WIFE, AND MY EIGHT MONTH OLD BABY GIRL IN DANGER DUE TO THE FACT WE HAD NO WHERE TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY & WERE QUICKLY SLOWING DOWN IN TRAFFIC. THIS INCIDENT ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE FASTER HIGHWAY TRAFFIC. IT HAS SINCE COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND THAT IT IS CAUSED BY THE RADIATOR LEAKING COOLANT INTO THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION FLUID TO MIX WITH THE RADIATOR FLUID, EFFECTIVELY DESTROYING THE TRANSMISSION. I WAS ABLE TO SLOWLY WORK THE RPMS UP & GET THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT UP A FEW GEARS SO WE COULD MAKE IT OFF THE HIGHWAY. I THEN CONTACTED MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER WHO ADVISED THAT NISSAN WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUES AND HAVE EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 100,000 MI. HE INFORMED ME THAT TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION & THE RADIATOR IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $7000, HOWEVER, IF I WAS UNDER 100,000 MI, I WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY A $3,000 DEDUCTIBLE.

IF I WAS TO SIT AT RED LIGHTS THE CAR WOULD BLOW COLD AIR AGAIN. THAT SPRING I NOTICED THE CAR JERKING AND DRIVING A LITTLE ROUGH BUT DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE UNIVERSAL C JOINT BACK THAT PRIOR FALL. THE SUMMER OF 2011 AND AT FIRST I NOTICED THE RPM'S REVVING UP BUT THE CAR WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE. THEN THE AIR WENT OUT AND WOULD COOL DOWN THE CAR. MEANWHILE I AM DRIVING MY KIDS AROUND IN A CAR WITH NO AC IN 100 SUMMER HEAT AND HUMIDITY. EVENTUALLY THE CAR GOT SO BAD IT WOULDN'T RUN. IT WOULD REV UP BUT GO NO WHERE.

ON 9/16/2013 I WAS INFORMED THAT MY TRANSMISSION HAD BECOME CONTAMINATED WITH RADIATOR COOLANT AND MY TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACE AT THE COST OF $5300.00 PLUS APPLICABLE TAX. I WAS FURTHER INFORMED THAT THIS WAS KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS GENERATION VEHICLE BUT THAT NISSAN ONLY PROVIDED REPAIR ASSISTANCE FOR VEHICLES WITH LESS THAN 100K MILES ON THEM AND I WAS THEREFOR REQUIRED TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT. IT WAS ONLY LATER THROUGH ONLINE RESEARCH THAT I DISCOVERED THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAD BEEN THE ONLY REASON THEY PROVIDED ANY REPAIR ASSISTANCE. I ALSO NOTED THAT THE VASTT MAJORITY OF REPORTED CASES WERE FOR VEHICLES OVER THE 100K MARK.    1. IF THIS WAS A KNOWN DEFECT THAT AFFECTED MILLIONS OF VEHICLES WHY WASN'T NISSAN FORCED TO PERFORM A RECALL AND REPLACE THE RADIATORS.  2. WHY WAS I NOT AS A MINIMUM INFORMED OF THE DEFECT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WITH 74K MILES ON IT. WITH LESS THAN 80K ON THEM NISSAN WOULD REPAIR THE PROBLEM AT THEIR COST.  3. IF THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT AS A RULE HAPPENING TO VEHICLES UNTIL THEY GO OVER 100K MILES THEN WHY CAP THE ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENT.  4. NOW THAT IT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS AS A KNOWN FAILURE WHY ARE THE CONSUMERS PAYING ANYTHING TO DO THESE REPAIRS WHN IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH A $200.00 RADIATOR AND AN HOURS LABOR.    I FIND THIS VERY DISHONEST THAT NISSAN WAS NOT FORCED BY THE COURTS OR THE NHTSA TO DO A FULL RECALL OR DISCLOSURE TO OWNERS. IF SO MANY VEHICLES ARE ON THE ROAD WHICH CAN HAVE A MAJOR TRANSMISSION FAILURE AT ANY TIME WHY HASN'T THE NHTSA FORCED NISSAN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? THIS MAY NOT BE AS HAZARDOUS AS FUEL TANKS RUPTURING BUT I WOULD THINK THAT A VEHICLE THAT HAS A TRANSMISSION FAILURE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS SHOULD BE OF CONCERN.    *JS",

I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED BUT JUST A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD I REALIZED IT HADN'T. SO I BROUGHT IT BACK AND THEY TOOK A SECOND LOOK AND TOLD ME IT MAY BE TWO THINGS. EITHER THE TORQUE CONVERTER IS BAD OR THE COOLANT HOSE BUSTED AND THE ANTIFREEZE WAS DRAINING INTO THE TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION TO BLOW OUT. THEY THEN TOLD ME TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION WOULD COST ME AROUND $6,000 WHICH TO ME IS WORTH MORE THAN THE ACTUAL VEHICLE.

I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THIS WAS A KNOWN DEFECT FOR 2005 AND 2006 XTERRA PATHFINDERS ETC. I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A NHTSA CAMPAIGN RECALL ON THIS ID # 10V075000.

I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT TO REPLICATE.  I LEFT THERE AND DROVE TO TROPHY NISSAN IN MESQUITE AND THEY WOULDN'T LOOK AT IT FOR ANOTHER 1.5 DAYS AND ONLY AFTER I PAID THEM AN $85 DIAGNOSTIC FEE (TO LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT IS THERE FAULT!) I DECIDED TO BE PROACTIVE AND REPLACE THE RADIATOR AND HOSES, HOPING TO CATCH IT EARLY ENOUGH.  I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC 2 DAYS LATER.  THEY SAID THE RUMBLING WAS FROM A TORQUE CONVERTER LOCK-UP AND WE COULD DO A FLUSH BUT THAT MAY NOT FIX IT.  SO, WE FLUSHED IT WITH 12 QTS NEW NISSAN TRANSMISSION OIL.  THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO STAY THE SAME OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN THE TRANSMISSIONS WENT OUT ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK.  SO, NOW WE GET TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  I CALLED A TRANSMISSION SHOP, (AT THIS POINT I DON'T TRUST NISSAN OR ANYTHING THEY SAY - SINCE THEY CAN'T EVEN ADMIT FAULT ON THIS!) AND THEY SAID THIS TRANSMISSION IS AN EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION (WITH IT'S COMPUTER ETC.) SO JUST TO REBUILD IT IS GOING TO RUN $2500.  NISSAN WANTS $4400+ JUST FOR A NEW PART.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AS MINE COMPLETELY WENT OUT WHEN I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION.  I AM SO DISGUSTED AT NISSAN AND THEIR LACK OF MORALS / VALUES.  IF THEY WOULD JUST DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIX THE ISSUE THAT IS THEIR OWN FAULT, THEN I THINK EVERYONE WOULD FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  THEY NEED TO STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCT THEY SELL.

LATER I FOUND OUT MY CAR WAS LEAKING A WHITE SUBSTANCE WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO GET OFF MY DRIVEWAY.   I WAS SURPRISED SINCE I REGULARLY KEEP UP WITH THE MAINT AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN THE PAST.  I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO  NISSAN IN TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAD A LEAK AND THE COOLANT AND TRANSMISSION FLUID BEGAN TO MIX TO CREATE THE WHITE SUBSTANCE WHICH RUINED MY TRANSMISSION.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THIS WAS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE XTERRAS AND THAT NISSAN MADE A DESIGN CHANGE TO FIX IT IN LATER XTERRA MODELS. TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION, RADIATOR, UPPER/LOWER RADIATOR HOSE.   THEIR INITIAL ESTIMATE TO FIX MY CAR WAS $8500.  AFTER I HEARD THE NUMBER, I PRICED EACH OF THE PARTS OUT ONLINE FOR APPROX $1500.   PROVIDED A NEW ESTIMATE FOR $5,500.     BECAUSE THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NISSAN WOULD HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING TO FIX IT AS PART OF A RECALL.

APPARENTLY IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FUEL SENDING UNIT. A SIMILAR PROBLEM WAS FOUND ON THE 2000-2004 XTERRA MODELS AND A RECALL WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD STOP AFTER NOT GETTING ANY FUEL, POSING A GREAT DANGER. IT SEEMS THAT SOMETHING IN THE UNIT IS FAULTY AND WILL CORRODE OVER TIME. THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING THE PROBLEM IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE FOR OVER 2 YRS AND WITH AROUND 39K-49K. IF THIS PROBLEM EXISTED IN PREVIOUS MODELS, AND IT WAS RECALLED, THE 2005-2007 XTERRAS, FRONTIERS, AND PATHFINDERS SHOULD GET THIS FIXED AT NO CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER!!

NISSAN ADVERTISES THIS VEHICLE AS AN OFF ROAD VEHICLE, THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I GOT THIS VEHICLE, TO GO OFF ROADING IN.  I HAVE 12,000 MILES ON MY XTERRA.  ON SEPTEMBER 30TH I WAS HEADING UP TO THE MOUNTAINS TO GO 4 WHEELING.  I WAS ON A DIRT ROAD THAT TOOK ME TO THE TRAIL HEAD OF THIS 4X4 TRAIL.  ON THIS DIRT ROAD MY AIRBAGS WENT OFF.  BOTH SIDE IMPACT AIRBAGS WENT OFF, THANKFULLY NOT THE FRONT AIRBAGS.  THERE WAS NO REASON FOR MY AIRBAGS TO GO OFF.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT OR IMPACT AND MY CAR WASN'T SIDEWAYS OR ROLLED OVER.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER THAT MONDAY, OCT. 2ND, 2006.    THE REASON I'M FILING A COMPLAINT IS IT TOOK NISSAN 30 DAYS TO EVEN SAY THEY WOULD FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE TRIED AND STILL FAIL TO SEE HOW IT WOULD EVEN BE AN ISSUE THAT THIS WOULDN'T BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  ALSO, NISSAN CLAIMS THE AIRBAGS WORKED PROPERLY AND THAT THEY ARE ONLY FIXING THEM OUT OF GOOD WILL.  IF THESE AIRBAGS WORKED PROPERLY, THEN I FEEL NISSAN HAS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND THEY SHOULD DO A RECALL OR FIND A WAY TO DISCONNECT THIS SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS.   NISSAN CLAIMS THAT THE SENSORS DETECTED A ROLLOVER.  IF YOU LOOK AT MY CAR THERE IS NO DAMAGE, AND I KNOW MY CAR WASN'T SIDEWAYS OR ANYTHING THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO FLIPPING OVER, BUT I HAVE NO WAY TO PROVE IT.  I WAS ON A DIRT ROAD THAT WAS ROUGH AND BUMPY, BUT THERE WAS NO OFF-CAMBER ANGLES THAT COULD HAVE MADE MY AIRBAGS GO OFF.  KNOWING THAT THE AIRBAGS WORKED THE WAY THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO, ACCORDING TO NISSAN, I AM SCARED TO DRIVE MY XTERRA IN FEAR THAT THEY WILL GO OFF AGAIN.  I TRULY BELIEVE NISSAN HAS MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THESE AIRBAGS AND THIS IS WHY I'M FILING A COMPLAINT.    MY GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH ME AND DIDN'T SUFFER ANY MAJOR INJURIES, BUT WAS BEATEN UP PRETTY BAD AND SORE FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT.  *JB",
