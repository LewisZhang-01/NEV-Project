THE CAR IS TOTALED, AND I NEED ANSWERS AS TO HOW A CAR THAT IS PARKED ALL OF A SUDDEN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.   MY 2004 NISSAN QUEST CUT OFF ON ME AT A STOP SIGN ON OCTOBER 31, 2013. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR I COULD SMELL ANTIFREEZE. I HAD IT TOWED TO COWLS NISSAN THAT EVENING. WHEN I GOT TO COWLS NISSAN THEY WERE ABOUT TO CLOSE, BUT I WAS ABLE TO RENT A CAR FROM THEM WHILE MINE WOULD BE GETTING LOOKED AT AND HOPEFULLY FIXED THE NEXT DAY. THE NEXT DAY A REPRESENTATIVE FROM COWLS NISSAN CALLED ME AND TOLD ME THAT THE REAR COOLANT PUMP NEEDED FIXING AND THAT'?S WHY THE CAR CUT OFF AND WOULDN'?T START. THEY REPLACED THE PUMP AND REFILLED IT WITH ANTIFREEZE. I HAD MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS FIXED BECAUSE THEY SAID AS THEY DID A COURTESY MULTIPOINT INSPECTION THE WIPERS WEREN'?T WORKING BECAUSE OF A WIPER LINK ISSUE. WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP THE CAR I NOTICED ON THE RECEIPT THAT THERE WAS AN OIL LEAK ISSUE AND AIR FILTER ISSUE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE MULTIPOINT INSPECTION. THEY ALSO NOTED THAT MY TIMING CHAIN WAS NOISY AT STARTUP AND THAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE DIAGNOSED FURTHER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. AT NO TIME WAS I TOLD THAT THE CAR WASN'T SAFE TO DRIVE. ON NOVEMBER 10, 2013 I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HUMMING SOUND COMING FROM THE CAR, OFF AND ON, AND THEN THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT WENT OUT. I TOOK THE CAR IN TO FIX THE HEADLIGHT ON 11/22/2013, BUT I WASN'T HEARING THE HUMMING SOUND THEN. I STARTED HEARING THE HUMMING SOUND AGAIN CLOSE TO THANKSGIVING (11/26/2013) AND PLANNED TO TAKE THE CAR BACK IN AFTER THE HOLIDAY.   *TR",

WERE THERE EVEN AIRBAGS IN THE VAN?  OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DAMAGE IN DAYLIGHT HOURS, BUT AT THOSE SPEEDS AND SINCE WE HIT HEAD ON AT THE VERY LEAST THE AIRBAGS IN FRONT SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP (WERE I PURCHASED IT FROM), AND AS I PULLED INTO THE LOT THE LIGHTS WENT OFF (FEB 28).  THE SERVICE REP. TOLD ME THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE STORED IN MY VAN'S COMPUTER SYSTEM.  I PAID $97.40 FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO HOOK MY CAR UP FOR A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT ABS SYSTEM PUMP AND MODULE ASSEMBLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1790.  THE SERVICE REP ALSO TOLD ME THAT WHAT EVER WAS CAUSING THE HUMMING NOISE WOULD BE REPAIRED. ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX, BECAUSE ON MY WAY BACK HOME THE NOISE STARTED AGAIN.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT MY BRAKES WERE FUNCTIONAL BUT MY ABS UNIT DID NOT AFFECT MY NORMAL BRAKES.  UNTIL I COULD HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE, AND WITH NO OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, I CONTINUED TO DRIVE MY VAN.  I CALLED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ASK IF THERE WAS ANYWAY FOR THEM TO DISCONNECT THE ABS SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WAS CONTINUING TO DRAIN MY BATTERY.  AND I WAS TOLD NO, THE ONLY WAY WAS TO HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE.  ON MARCH 8, I PART MY VAN AND THREE HOURS LATER I RETURNED TO MY VAN AND IT WOULD NOT START.

I THEN SUBMITTED RECEIPTS FROM INDEPENDENT STATION OWNERS INDICATING THAT ALL NECESSARY MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED.  AFTER WAITING YET ANOTHER WEEK FOR AN ANSWER FROM EMMA AND NISSAN, EMMA INFORMED ME THAT NISSAN WOULD NOT PAY TO REPLACE MY VEHICLE BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE MY VEHICLE SERVICED AT A NISSAN DEALERSHIP.

INCONSISTENT CLOSING: WHEN A BUTTON IS PUSHED TO CLOSE THE DOOR, IT DOES NOT ALWAYS CLOSE. IT GOES TO ABOUT 6 INCHES FROM CLOSURE AND THEN BACKS OPEN. THIS GETS TO BE VERY FRUSTRATING.  2. MORE DANGEROUS IS THE FACT THAT THE SENSOR DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY WHEN THE BUTTON IS ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED AND SOMEONE IS IN THE WAY. THE DOOR PROCEEDS TO CLOSE DESPITE AN OBSTRUCTION AND REQUIRES TREMENDOUS FORCE TO OPEN AGAIN. BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THE DOOR.

TOOK THE VAN BACK TO THE DEALER ON 6/7/05 AS THE SMELL HAD RETURNED.  THIS TIME THE DEALER REPLACED THE IN-CABIN AIR FILTER (SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE) AND SPRAYED LYSOL IN THE VENTS AND A/C DUCTS.  THE VAN CONTINUED TO SMELL AND WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER ON 6/21/05.  THIS TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS DISASSEMBLED THE DASH TO ACCESS THE EVAPORATOR.  THE MOISTURE DRAIN TUBE (WHICH IS CLEAR) WAS BROWN.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THIS. NISSAN CLEANED THE TUBE AND REASSEMBLED THE DASH. SINCE EACH OF THESE REPAIRS WAS WARRANTY WORK, I REQUESTED THAT NISSAN PAY FOR A RENTAL CAR.  SINCE NISSAN CLAIMS THAT NO REPAIR WORK WAS DONE, I HAD TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL CAR EACH TIME. I CONDUCTED SOME RESEARCH AND LEARNED THAT MOLD AND BACTERIA IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR AUTOMOBILE A/C SYSTEMS.  MOST CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.  NISSAN DOES NOT.  I MAILED A LETTER TO NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  THEIR REPRESENTATIVE CALLED ONCE AND TOLD TO TAKE THE VAN BACK IN FOR SERVICE.  EACH TIME I TOOK THE VAN BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I WOULD CALL THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  HE NEVER RETURNED MY PHONE CALLS.  DURING MY LAST SERVICE CALL WITH NISSAN ON 6/21/05, I GAVE THE SERVICE MANAGER A COPY OF A DOCUMENT THAT LISTS THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS (TSBS) THAT MOST CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE FOR TREATING THE MOLD AND BACTERIA.  NISSAN DOES NOT HAVE A TSB FOR THIS ISSUE.  *NM",

BESIDES THE CONSTANT BEEPING, AT TIMES THE LIFTGATE WILL NOT OPEN, ALSO WHEN OPEN THE LIFTGATE WILL NOT CLOSE USING THE POWER BUTTONS-THEN LIFTGATE NEEDS TO BE SHUT MANUALLY. AT MY 7/21/04 SERVICE APPT, THE DEALER ORDERED A PART THAT WOULD BE INSTALLED LATER TO FIX BEEPING. PICKED THE VAN UP ABOUT 4:30 PM, GOT GROCERIES, PICKED UP DAUGHTER & DROVE HOME. ON THE WAY THE VAN WAS BEEPING ALL THE WAY WHEN SUDDENLY A FLASHING WARNING LIGHT CAME ON THAT SAID \"WARNING LIFT GATE OPEN\". I PANICKED THINKING MY LIFT GATE WAS ABOUT TO FLY OPEN. I PULLED OVER CONFUSED BECAUSE LIFTGATE WAS NOT OPEN. I PUSHED INTERIOR CONTROL FOR LIFT GATE BUT LIFTGATE DID NOT OPEN. THINKING I WAS TEMP. OK, I SLOWLY DROVE HOME W/ FLASHING WARNING SIGNAL ON WHOLE TIME. WHEN I GOT HOME-TRIED TO OPEN LIFTGATE. IT WOULDN'T BUDGE-NOT W/ POWER CONTROLS INSIDE VAN NOR KEY FOB. IT WOULDN'T OPEN MANUALLY EITHER. AT THAT POINT, I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE VAN ANY FURTHER. WAS WELL AFTER 5 PM & THE SERVICE DEPT WOULD BE CLOSED BUT I CALLED THEM ANYWAY. I TALKED TO JOHN NELSON, SALES MGR & EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED. TOLD HIM I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE VAN BECAUSE OF WARNING LIGHT BUT CAN'T SEEM TO OPEN/CLOSE DOOR EITHER. HE ASSURED ME THAT VAN HAS \"SAFETY MECHANISMS\" THAT WOULD PREVENT DOOR FROM FLYING OPEN WHILE DRIVING.

WE HAVE 4 CHILDREN. THEY ARE AGED AS FOLLOWS: 14 YEARS, 11 YEARS, 20 MONTHS, 6 WEEKS. SINCE WE HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER. WITH ABOUT 350 MILES ON IT, THE AIR CONDITIONER LOCKED UP AND THE COMPRESSOR WAS REPLACED. AROUND MAY WE NOTICED THE AC WAS NOT COOLING THE VAN OFF AT ALL. KEEP IN MIND WE ARE IN TEXAS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MILDER MONTHS. WE TOOK THE VAN IN SOMETIME IN EARLY JUNE TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT. SHORTLY THERE AFTER THEY RETURNED THE VEHICLE STATING IT WAS PERFORMING TO MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS. I THEN WENT AND PURCHASED A AC VENT THERMOMETER. ON LOW THE TEMPERATURE BLOWING OUT OF THE VENTS IS COLD AROUND 50 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. HOWEVER WHEN YOU TURN IT TO MEDIUM OR HIGH SPEED THE TEMPERATURE THAT BLOWS OUT AT THE VENTS IS AROUND 70-75 DEGREES. THIS TEMPERATURE IS CONSISTENT EVEN AFTER THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30-35 MINUTES WITH AN OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE OF AROUND 90. (WHICH AGAIN IS MILD FOR A TEXAS SUMMER). WITH THE AIR ON HIGH FOR 30-35 MINUTES THE TEMPERATURE  IN THE CABIN AT THE MIDDLE ROW OF SEATS IS 87 DEGREES. THIS IS ALSO WITH THE REAR AIR ON HIGH AS WELL. MY CHILD'S PEDIATRICIAN ADVISED ME TO NOT LET MY INFANT RIDE IN THESE TEMPERATURES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF DEHYDRATION. SO, BASICALLY I AM IN A $35,000 (MSRP) AUTOMOBILE THAT I CAN NOT LET MY CHILD RIDE IN ON ANY TRIPS FOR FEAR THAT HE MAY GET SICK. THIS IS NOT RIGHT AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SUFFER NOR SHOULD MY CHILD. THE VEHICLE IS SIMPLY NOT PERFORMING AS IT SHOULD.*AK",

I'VE TAKEN THE QUEST IN TO HAVE THE DOORS ADJUSTED FIVE TIMES AT THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER AND THE DOORS CONTINUE TO RATTLE. THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO STOP THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR FROM RATTLING, BUT THIS RESULTED IN A DOOR NOT ABLE TO BE OPENED USING THE EXTERIOR HANDLE, YOU HAD TO USE THE KEY-FOB OR INTERIOR SWITCHES (NOT ACCEPTABLE IN A $33,000 AUTOMOBILE). THE CAR WAS BROUGHT BACK IN FOR SERVICE AND WHILE THE DOOR NOW OPERATES (SORT OF \u0013 SEE BELOW), THE RATTLING IS BACK.    THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR DOES NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITHOUT INPUT DIRECT FROM NISSAN - I HOPE THEY ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION TO THE QUEST\u0019S SLIDING DOOR PROBLEMS!    THE PROBLEMS WITH MY VEHICLES REAR SLIDING DOORS CONTINUE TO GET WORSE. ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2004 I HAD A PROBLEM WITH BOTH SLIDING DOORS; NEITHER WAS ABLE TO BE CLOSED. MILES FROM HOME IN SUBZERO WEATHER WITH A CAR WHOSE SIDING REAR DOORS WOULD NOT CLOSE \u0013 BET YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HAPPY I WAS. THANK GOD I FIGURED OUT HOW TO OPERATE THE DOORS MANUALLY.

CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED IF I HAD HAD MY YOUNG 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE BACK. HORROR DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO BEING AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION.

FIRST THE NEW PROBLEMS: THE PAST 2 WEEKS TEMPS HAVE BEEN IN SINGLE DIGITS AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SNOW OR RAIN. I HAVE HAD TO KEEP CAR IN DRIVEWAY. DURING THESE PAST WEEKS I'VE EXPERIENCED THREE PROBLEMS, ONE OF WHICH INFURIATED ME. FIRST TWO ITEMS - PASSENGER WINDOW WILL NOT OPEN AND CAR DOES NOT 'BEEP' WHEN I LOCK FROM REMOTE (WHICH MAKES ME HAVE TO TURN BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK THE DOORS ONLY TO FIND IT HAS INDEED LOCKED)- ARE ANNOYING AND I ATTRIBUTED THEM TO THE TEMPERATURE. THE THIRD PROBLEM OCCURRED YESTERDAY: PASSENGER SIDE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR WOULD NOT CLOSE ONCE OPENED. IT WOULD BEEP, SLIDE ALMOST CLOSED, THEN OPEN RIGHT UP AGAIN. I COULD NOT FORCE IT TO REMAIN CLOSED. THIS HAPPENED IN A GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT, TEMPERATURE WAS -1 DEGREES, CAR HAD A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF PURCHASES INSIDE, AND I HAD MY VERY YOUNG CHILD WITH ME. AFTER CHECKING MANUAL AND SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE AT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP (NEITHER OF WHICH WERE HELPFUL, TO BE HONEST) I TRIED CLEANING THE TRACKS AROUND DOOR. THERE WAS NO ICE, DIRT, SAND, ETC. AND STILL THE DOOR WOULD NOT CLOSE. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS NO MANUAL OVERRIDE WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO CLOSE THE DOOR.  LATER IN THE DAY AFTER THE CAR HAD BEEN IN THE SUN A FEW HOURS, MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO GET THE DOOR CLOSED ENOUGH TO GRAB AND LOCK IT. THIS DOOR ISSUE IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN AND PURPOSELY BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR IT'S RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. THERE WAS NOTHING RELIABLE NOR SAFE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US YESTERDAY.
