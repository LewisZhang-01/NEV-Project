MY TIRE SENSOR LIGHT HAD COME ON MAYBE 10 MINUTES AT MOST PRIOR TO THE TIRE EXPLODING, WE SHOULD'VE HAD TIME TO MAKE IT TO A GAS STATION. I BROUGHT MY CAR TO  SARASOTA FORD THE NEXT DAY & WAS TOLD I SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY PUT A SPARE ON MY CAR & BROUGHT THE TIRE IN BECAUSE MOST LIKELY THE VALVE STEM WAS LEAKING & THEY WOULD'VE COVERED THE TIRE. JIMMY SAID THAT I RUINED THE TIRE BECAUSE OF DRIVING ON IT WITH LOW TIRE PRESSURE.  I PAID THE $225.BECAUSE I STILL HAD A SPARE TIRE ON MY CAR & I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH IT & I WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE TRYING TO TELL HIM THAT I  DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BE GIVEN A 10 MIN.WARNING TO GET YOUR TIRE OFF THE ROAD BEFORE IT JUST DISINTEGRATES.

I GET MY OIL CHANGED EVERY 3,000 MI , MY TIRES ROTATED EVERY OTHER OIL CHANGE & THE RECORDS WILL SHOW THAT I TAKE CARE OF ANY NEEDS THAT MY CAR HAS, I DON'T IGNORE THEM AS HE WOULD IMPLY.

A FEW SECONDS LATER SHE SAW A SPARK COMING FROM THE MIDDLE SECTION OF THE DASH BOARD THEN ALL THE WINDOWS BLEW OUT AT ONCE AND THE CAR BURST INTO FLAMES.

THE TREE, BUSHES , GRASS AND LIRIOPE ON THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND THERE IS GLASS ALL OVER MY YARD.  THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED.
