I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO SWIPE A PIECE OF HAIR OFF OF THE DASH AND IT LEFT A SCUFF ON THE DASHBOARD THAT WILL NOT COME OUT. I AM DEVASTATED AS I SPENT $50,000 ON THIS CAR AND HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN IMMACULATE CARE OF MY VEHICLES; HOWEVER, SIMPLY WIPING THE DASH HAS CAUSED IRREVERSIBLE SCUFFS. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE, I DO SEE HUNDREDS OF OTHER LEXUS OWNERS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. IS THERE AN EXISTING RECALL FOR THIS THAT CAN BE EXTENDED INTO THE 2020S? I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WITH ANY OTHER LUXURY VEHICLES THAT I'VE EVER OWNED FOR 5+ YEARS.",
