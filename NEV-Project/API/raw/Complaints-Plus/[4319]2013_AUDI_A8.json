        "summary": "On the afternoon of September 12, 2018, my 2013 Audi A8L 4.0T started with somewhat of a rough idle, but no warning lights or error codes were present on the dashboard.  I owned the car for approximately 18 months at that point, and this had never happened before.  As soon as I started to drive, the tachometer became steady and there were no other indications anything was wrong, even stopping at traffic lights the problem did no persist nor were there any indications anything was wrong.  Once back in Spartanburg, the car stalled while slowing down for a traffic light.  The engine cut off completely, the steering became very rigid, and the Check Engine light turned on.  I was able to coast to a stop and turn on my hazard lights, and then tried to restart the car to no avail.  The engine would turn over, but the car would not start.    Another car stopped behind me, and we were able to push the car onto the grassy shoulder out of traffic, which was dangerous in itself but safer than sitting in the middle of a busy road.  I had the car towed to Steve White Audi in Greenville, SC.  Once there, they informed me that the error codes indicated that both turbo's failed simultaneously and the failure of those turbos caused the first set of downstream catalytic converters to fail also.  See attached repair report and payment receipt = $10,975.57 for the replacement parts and labor ($12,070.85 including the 115,000 mile service).    Once they told me the cost of the repair, I called Volkswagen USA corporate headquarters to ask if there were any pending recalls for the turbos.  Multiple message boards and FaceBook pages go into detail about how the turbos are a known point of failure on the 4.0T cars, and the astronomical cost to replace them.  I was informed by Volkswagen that there were no pending recalls, and that I would have to pay for the repairs out of pocket, which I did.",

Volkswagen auto group had previously issued a voluntary TSB regarding this known design shortcoming in the turbo system of the 4.0T engine. The oil screens that filter the turbo cooling were engineered with a mesh that was too fine. This mesh eventually clogged and severed oil flow to the turbo units, causing failure. There is discussion of this design shortcoming in every single Audi online group, so much so, that when new members join the owners Facebook group, they are nearly all immediately warned to change their oil screens. The concept that I was without a vehicle for months as well as having to pay for this repair out of pocket still shocks me - I had several heated calls with the Audi warranty headquarters and an incident at the dealership that required retraining of the service staff. Needless to say, this turbo failure on my vehicle was an absolute nightmare. I\u2019d be more than happy to share all of my documents and story with the NHTSB. Thank you.",

On 8/6/21  I was traveling in the middle lane of I495 at 65 mph, when traffic slowed, the car stalled. With cars passing me on both sides I eventually managed to get the car started and made it to exit 15 (rt44) going toward Plymouth, MA. This truly was a scary situation, waiting to be rear ended. While on rt 44 it died again in traffic. I managed to make it into the breakdown lane. At about 2:55 pm a state Trooper stopped and asked if he could help me get to a safer spot but by that time I had called AAA. At 3:30pm AAA arrived and towed us to a safe spot. At no time before, during or after this failure did I receive any message or warning that this failure was imminent. The car was taken to Audi Norwell and diagnosed with defective turbos due to failure of turbo shaft  bearings . The screens were clogged preventing oil from reaching the bearings. The turbos were the original equipment. I have read in the Audi Forum this is not an uncommon problem. I understand the screens have been redesigned as a result.",
