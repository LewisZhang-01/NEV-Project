HAS BEEN SHIFTING ABRUPTLY AND INTO INAPPROPRIATE GEARS FOR SOME TIME. THIS IS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I NEARLY TOTALED MY ACURA WHILE TRYING TO PASS A SLOW MOVING VEHICLE AND THE TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTIONED DURING THIS ATTEMPT AT PASSING. I NEARLY COLLIDED WITH ON COMING TRAFFIC. MY CAR IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HAS CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD THE COST OF A NEW REPLACEMENT FROM THE FACTORY. THIS HAS CAUSED ME A LOT OF WASTED TIME AND MONEY. ON A \"LUXURY\" BRAND AUTOMOBILE, ONE WOULD NOT EXPECT TO HAVE TO REPLACE OR REBUILF THE TRANSMISSION JUST APPROX. 3 YEARS AFTER IT WAS SOLD AS BRAND NEW. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A FAMILIAR PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF TRANSMISSION AND EXPECT THE HONDA MANUFACTURER TO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND REPLACE OR FIX THE PROBLEM THAT MANY OWNERS ARE HAVING. I WOULD APPRETIATE BEING UPDATED ON *ANY* PROGRESS THAT IS MADE WITH CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM.
