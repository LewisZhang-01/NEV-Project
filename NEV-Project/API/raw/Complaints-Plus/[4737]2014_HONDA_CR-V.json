WE ARE PRESENTLY UNABLE TO CONVENIENTLY ACCESS 32.9 CUBIC FEET OF SPACE BEHIND THE SECOND ROW OF SEATS DUE TO THE FAULTY TAILGATE OPENER.

I ASKED [XXX] IF HE KNEW IF THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM. AND HE SAID YES WITH CRV'S AND THEY GET THEM IN TO REPAIR. I SAID I READ IT IS AN ISSUE WITH HONDA CRV'S 2012-2014. HE SAID YES. I SAID WHY ISN'T HONDA DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW.

I CALLED HONDA IN AUGUST 2018, AND STARTED A CASE REGARDING OIL CONSUMPTION AND NOISE RELATED TO TIMING CHAIN. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING VEHICLE TO HONDA DEALERSHIP TO BEGIN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AND TO HAVE NOISE LOOKED AT. I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO LIA HONDA WHO TOLD ME TO WAIT UNTIL OIL NEEDED TO BE CHANGED TO START CONSUMPTION TEST B/C THE OIL WAS RECENTLY CHANGED AND IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF NEW OIL. I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO KEELER HONDA IN NOVEMBER OF 2018 TO COMPLETE THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WHEN THE OIL NEEDED TO BE CHANGED AND TO HAVE THE NOISE CHECKED OUT. THEY CHANGED THE OIL AND COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE NOISE, STATING THE CAR WAS FINE. AS I DROVE THE CAR OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE NOISE GOT WORSE. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY STATED I SHOULD BRING THE CAR BACK TO HONDA BECAUSE IT SHOULD'VE BEEN UNDER WARRANTEE AND SOMETHING WAS DEFINITELY WRONG. I CALLED HONDA MANUFACTURER AND REFERENCED MY CASE FROM AUG OF 2018- THEY AGREED TO DOCUMENT THAT MY CAR WAS COVERED B/C THESE ISSUES STEM FROM WHEN IT WAS UNDER WARRANTEE (NOW HAS 62KMI).

IN 2014 HONDA CHANGED THEIR TPMS FROM THE CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM WHICH USES PRESSURE SENSORS IN THE WHEELS.  INSTEAD, IT COMPARES THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE TIRES ON THE THEORY THAT A LOW TIRE WILL ROTATE FASTER THAN A NORMALLY INFLATED TIRE.  THIS IS A GOOD IDEA IN THEORY.  HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE IT DOES NOT WORK.  THE SOFTWARE MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE TIRES DO NOT ROTATE EQUALLY ON TURNS.  ALSO, SLIGHT (AND ACCCEPTABLE) DIFFERENCES IN PRESSURE OR TIRE WEAR WILL RESULT IN ERRORS THAT THE SOFTWARE MUST DEAL WITH.  HONDA ISSUED TSB 14-006 IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, BUT IF IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO OUR CAR IT HAS NOT WORKED.  THE TPMS LIGHT ON OUR CR-V IS UNRELIABLE.  IT OCCASIONALLY LIGHTS WHEN THE TIRES ARE OK, BUT HAS FAILED TO INDICATE LOW OR FLAT TIRES FOR US SEVERAL TIMES.    MY WIFE WENT TO THE DEALER IN PRESCOTT, AZ, THIS MORNING TO ASK WHETHER TSB 14'006 HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE CAR.  THE REPLY WAS THAT THERE IS NO RECALL AND IF THE TPMS LIGHT DOES NOT STAY ON, THERE IS NO NEED TO DO IT.    WE CAN LIVE WITH A NON-FUNCTIONAL TPMS SYSTEM. OUR PREVIOUS CARS WORKED WELL WITHOUT IT.  OUR NORMAL MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES REQUIRE CHECKING TIRE PRESSURES PERIODICALLY.  FOR SOME REASON THIS CAR DOES NOT PULL TO THE SIDE WHEN A TIRE GOES FLAT.  A TPMS SHOULD FLAG A TIRE FAILURE WHEN ON THE ROAD.  THREE TIMES WE HAVE HAD A TIRE FAIL WHILE DRIVING, WITH NO TPMS INDICATION.  OUR LOSS HAS BEEN ONLY THREE TIRES; NO ACCIDENT RESULTED.

THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL ON THE PANEL OF THE CAR, NO LIGHTS, NO GAUGES, THE TEMP WAS NORMAL. I CALLED 911 AT ABOUT 9:01AM.    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD THE FIRE OUT IN ABOUT 12 MINUTES.

THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME. IN ADDITION, AFTER MY TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT KEEPS GOING ON WHEN  I'M DRIVING APPROX 25 MILES ON THE EXPRESSWAY. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE MY VEHICLE HI CHECK UP, 12,170 MILES. THEN MY BATTERY DIED AT 13,129 MILES A MONTH AND A HALF AFTER MY MY MULTI-POINT INSPECTION, TIRE ROTATION, AND OIL CHANGE. THE AAA ROAD SIDE REPRESENTATIVE SAID I HAD BAD CELLS. TODAY, I READ ONLINE CONSUMER REPORTS OF GRINDING NOISE COMPLAINTS FROM OTHERS WHO DRIVE A 2014 HONDA CR-V. I CALLED THE HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE WHO DENIED HEARING THE GRINDING NOISE COMPLAINTS. THEY DID GIVE ME A CASE NUMBER REGARDING MY PREMATURE BATTERY FAILURE. THE CORPORATE REP DID REFER ME TO YOUR SITE STATING THERE ARE NO RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE. I AM REPORTING THIS ISSUES AS I THINK IT IS STRANGE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN AT AROUND 12,000 I'VE SUDDENLY HAD THESE WEIRD ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE. COULD THESE ISSUES BE CONNECTED BY AN ELECTRICAL SHORT? IS THE LIGHT GOING ON FROM A SHORT? IS THE BATTERY GOING DEAD FROM A SHORT? IS THE GRINDING CONNECTED TO A SHORT? I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE, I CAN'T KEEP TAKING TIME OFF FROM WORK TO DEAL WITH VEHICLE PROBLEMS.  I'VE ATTACHED 2 RECEIPT DOCUMENTS AND I CAN EMAIL A RECORDING OF ME STARTING MY VEHICLE.

A 2012 ECOLOGY CENTER STUDY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE OVER 270 CHEMICALS IN A NEW CAR, 70 OF THEM TOXIC (FORMALDEHYDE, STYRENE, BENZENE, AND TOLUENE ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS, ASTHMA, LEARNING DISORDERS, LEUKEMIA AND OTHER CANCERS) MY SYMPTOMS OF BREATHING DIFFICULTY, LETHARGY AND SLEEPINESS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THESE CHEMICALS POSE A HEALTH RISK FOR SIDS IN INFANTS. THE ECOLOGY CENTER AND AN ATTORNEY FOR SOMEONE WHO SUED TOYOTA FOR THIS SAME ISSUE SAID THAT MANY PEOPLE TOLD THEM THEY ALSO BECAME ILL FROM THE TOXINS IN THEIR NEW CARS. AMERICAN HONDA EVEN TOLD ME THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BECOME ILL FROM THE CHEMICALS. CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO THESE TOXINS. MANUFACTURERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL PRODUCTS THAT POSE HEALTH RISKS. THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION BEFORE SOMEONE BUYS A CAR. THE DEALER WOULDN'T REFUND. THEY PUT IN AN IONIZER, WHICH THEY SAID WOULD REMOVE THE CHEMICALS. WHEN I BREATHED IN THE AIR, AFTER THEY PUT IN THE IONIZER, IT BURNED MY LUNGS SO MUCH THAT I COULD BARELY BREATHE. MY LUNGS STILL HURT. THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOC, EPA, CALIF DEPT OF HEALTH AND JOHNS HOPKINS ALL REPORT THAT IONIZERS CREATE OZONE WHICH DAMAGES LUNGS, MAKES ANY CHEMICAL THAT IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH EVEN MORE VOLATILE AND CAN BE LETHAL. AUTO MANUFACTURERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SELL PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN TOXIC CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS. HOPEFULLY, THE NHTSA CAN DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THIS PRACTICE AND PROTECT CONSUMERS, ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE CHILDREN, SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER OR DIE NEEDLESSLY.

IN FACT A DEALERSHIP SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THAT HIS BROTHER HAS A HONDA WHICH HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM ALMOST FROM THE DAY HE PURCHASED IT.  I'M NOT JUST IMAGINING THIS.

RAY PRICE RAN CODES, WHICH ALL CAME UP CLEAR AND THEY RESET THE TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT AGAIN.  NEXT DAY, THE TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  1/4/14 BACK TO RAY PRICE, TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT ON AGAIN.  RAN CODES AGAIN AND CHECKED TIRE PRESSURE AGAIN, BOTH WERE GOOD.  THE TECH SAID IT MUST BE A RF SIGNAL AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT.  I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA 1/30/14 AND 1/31/14 ABOUT ISSUE.  AMERICAN HONDA STATED THAT THEY ARE AWAITING A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR THIS ISSUE.  SOFTWARE UPDATE SHOULD BE RELEASED BY END OF FEBRUARY, BUT NO GUARANTEES.  THE LIGHT HAS BEEN ON CLOSE TO 90% OF THE TIME SINCE WE HAVE OWNED THE CAR. ONCE THE LIGHT COMES ON IT NEEDS TO BE RESET BECAUSE IT WILL NOT GO OUT ON ITS OWN. HAVING THE TIRE PRESSURE COMING ON FALSELY CONSTANTLY IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  RAY PRICE CONTACTED ME ON 2/12/14 STATING THAT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS AVAILABLE AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO BRING THE CAR IN ON 2/14/14. AFTER RECEIVING THE CAR FROM THE APPOINTMENT I CHECKED THE TIRE PRESSURE AND THE TIRES WERE OVERINFLATED BY THE DEALER TO 35 PSI INSTEAD OF THE MANUFACTURES RECOMMENDED 30 PSI. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE THEIR QUICK FIX FOR THE ISSUE AND NOT AN ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION. OVERINFLATED TIRES MAKE YOUR VEHICLE RIDE HARSHLY, ARE MORE PRONE TO ROAD HAZARDS, WEAR UNEVENLY. THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF HONDAS OWNERS MANUAL.   MY MECHANIC ALSO SAYS THAT THIS ALSO INCREASES THE CHANCES OF HYDROPLANING.   *TR",

WITHIN 6 MILES OF LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING (TPM) LIGHT HAD COME ON INDICATING ONE OR MORE OF THE TIRES WAS LOW ON AIR. OUR SALESPERSON HAD ALREADY WARNED US ABOUT THIS DURING THE WALK THROUGH AT THE DEALERSHIP TELLING US THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO PULL OVER BECAUSE MORE THAN LIKELY THERE IS NO PROBLEM. BEING AN INFORMED CONSUMER WE WERE ALREADY AWARE THAT HONDA HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THEIR TPM SYSTEM ON THE 2014 MODEL. IT SIMPLE DOES NOT WORK. IT CRIES WOLF AND CAN NOT BE TRUSTED. AFTER RESETTING THE LIGHT IT WILL CONTINUALLY RETURN AND HAVE TO BE RESET WITHIN 50 MILES OR LESS OF IN TOWN DRIVING. ALTERNATELY WE RESET IT BEFORE A 240 MILES ROUND TRIP HWY DRIVE AND THE TPM LIGHT DID NOT COME ON DURING THE ENTIRE HWY TRIP.  THE PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT MANDATING TPM IN ALL NEW CARS WAS TWO FOLD. FIRST FOR FUEL ECONOMY, SECOND FOR SAFETY.  SINCE THE TPM LIGHT PROVIDES FALSE ALARMS EVERY WEEK, IT DOES NOT ACCOMPLISH EITHER GOAL. WE HAVE HAD NO FORMAL RESPONSE FROM HONDA ACKNOWLEDGING THERE IS A PROBLEM OR THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON A FIX. THERE IS A FORUM WITH 200 POSTS ON THE 2014 PROBLEMS AT THIS DIRECT ADDRESS: HTTP://WWW.CRVOWNERSCLUB.COM/FORUMS/14-PROBLEMS-ISSUES/27802-2014-TPM-PROBLEMS.HTML.  *TR",

HONDA DOES NOT HAVE A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE TPMS WARNING CAN NOT BE RELIED ON BECAUSE IT GIVES FALSE INDICATIONS.    I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TPMS ON THE 2014 HONDA CR-V IS AN INDIRECT SYSTEM. THERE ARE NO ACTUAL PRESSURE SENSORS. IT USES THE WHEEL SPEED/ROTATION SENSORS TO DETERMINE WHEN THERE IS A TIRE PRESSURE PROBLEM. THE COMPUTER INDICATES A PROBLEM BASED ON DIFFERENT SPEEDS/ROTATION OF THE WHEELS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SENSORS ARE THE PROBLEM OR IF IT IS THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE.  *TR",

MY LEG GOT STUCK AND I COULDN'T MOVE MY LEG FROM GAS PEDAL TO APPLY BRAKES, AS I ENTERED THE SCHOOL PREMISES.

IF SOMEONE WEARING A FLIP FLOP?S WHILE DRIVING, IT CAN GET STUCK IN THE TRIM AND CAUSE FATAL ACCIDENTS. I DIDN?T SEE THIS ISSUE IN OLDER MODEL YEARS OF CRV.
