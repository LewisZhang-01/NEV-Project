        "summary": "While driving our brand new RV (6k miles) on I10 in the middle of a rain storm and some hail (towing our Jeep Wrangler), just West of Junction Texas while going uphill the RV DEF tank needle dropped suddenly to empty (it was full) and truck decelerated rapidly throwing several different codes including check engine. We were able to pull off the road a couple of miles later. It was a DEF sensor and it was changed. We had to wait for the part as it is on back order as it is happening on most International Durastar 4300 and others on the Intl lineup. Also Peterbuilt etc. The DEF sensors and other parts on these trucks are downright dangerous specially to the unsuspecting RVer... PLEASE force a recall before someone gets killed.",
