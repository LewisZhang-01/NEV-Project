I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL FRAME BODY SHOPS. THEY ARE ALL AWARE OF THE TOYOTA TACOMA FRAME PROBLEMS AND THINK THE FRAME HAD BEEN RUSTING A LONG TIME AGO, WHILE THE TRUCK LOOKS/RUNS GREAT.

LOOKING AT THE INTERNET FORMS CONCERNING TACOMAS, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THIS COCK AND BULL STORY.

THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE ?DEFECTIVE AIR BAGS AND DEFECTIVE COMPUTER AIR BAG.?   OVER A YEAR AGO, THIS WAS ACCESSED FROM HALEY LOCATED OFF RT 288 AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT WAS COMING ON AT THAT TIME.   I PAID FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THEN, NOT TO REOCCUR A YEAR LATER.   IN ANY CASE, IF A TOYOTA VEHICLE HAS DEFECTIVE PARTS SUCH AS THE AIR BAG AND ITS COMPUTER THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER TO REPLACE THE PART AND ABSORB THE LABOR AND COSTS INVOLVED TO DO SO NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CLIENT.  THE CLIENT DID NOT CAUSE THE PROBLEM, IT IS A DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE.   THE PROBLEM I AM NOW FACING IS THAT HALEY TOYOTA WANTS ME TO ABSORB THIS COST OF PARTS AND LABOR TO THE  TUNE OF $711.00 FOR A DEFECTIVE AIR BAG.   I HAVE NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH AN ATTORNEY SPECIALIZING IN AUTO INJURY, BUT WITH SOME RESEARCH AND TAKING   WITH A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS A LAWYER; HE HIGHLY SUGGESTS THAT  UNLESS TOYOTA  REPLACES THE PARTS AND LABOR   AT THEIR EXPENSE THAT I SHOULD PROCEED WITH HIRING AN ATTORNEY AND EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE   AIR BAG AND WHAT HALEY HAS SAID.  FOR HALEY TO DISMISS THIS DEFECTIVE PART AND SAY THAT THEY CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE IS IN ITSELF AN ?EGREGIOUS? REMARK FOR WHICH THEY CAN BE LIABLE FOR IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN WHILE THE PASSENGER IS DRIVING THE CAR/TRUCK IN QUESTIONED.  INFACT, THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED ME TO LEAVE THE PREMISE THIS PAST FRIDAY KNOWING ALL OF THIS, BECAUSE IF A MAJOR ACCIDENT WERE TO HAPPEN THEY WOULD BE TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE AS WELL AS TOYOTA ITSELF.

IN FACT, SO MUCH RUST THAT THE RUBBER BODY MOUNT BLOCK ON TOP OF THE REAR LEAF SPRING SNAPPED OFF IN MY HAND. THE LEAF SPRINGS, BRAKE LINES, AND FRONT SUSPENSION AND FRAME ARE ALL IN QUESTION REGARDING VEHICLE SAFETY. I IMMEDIATELY DID RESEARCH ONLINE TO CHECK OUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF RUST ON THE FRAME AND TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD EXPERIENCED THIS TOO.  I WAS SHOCKED AT WHAT I FOUND.  A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE WITH TOYOTA TACOMA RUSTED FRAMES.  I COME TO FIND OUT ONLINE THAT TOYOTA HAS A HISTORY OF RUSTED FRAMES, BREAKING FRAMES, UNSAFE FRAMES, AND A RECALL CURRENTLY FOR A REAR SPARE TIRE MOUNT ISSUE DUE TO RUST. I ALSO FOUND OUT TOYOTA WAS REPLACING FRAMES ON MY MODEL. I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THIS TRUCK INSPECTED FOR PENNSYLVANIA STATE REQUIREMENTS AND TO HAVE THE RUST CHECKED.  THEY TOLD ME MY VEHICLE WAS NOT VALID FOR THE RUST INSPECTION AND THE FRAME REPLACEMENT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM EXPIRED, I WAS TOLD TO CALL TOYOTA. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY TOYOTA OR MY DEALER THERE WAS AN ISSUE, NOT BY MAIL, PHONE CALLS OR CERTIFIED MAIL. I HAD THE TRUCK PARKED IN MY GARAGE FOR THREE YEARS SO IT WASN'T EVEN ON THE ROAD DURING THIS TIME.

I WOULD ADD THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION INTO THE SAFETY OF THIS PROCEDURE AS WELL AS A MEDIA REQUIREMENT MADE THAT TOYOTA RUN ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV, RADIO AND PRINT WARNING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS SERIOUS ISSUE.

THE FAILURE HAPPENED AT THE SYNCHRONIZER FROM 4TH TO 5TH GEAR WHEN SHIFTING FROM NEUTRAL ACCORDING TO TOYOTA TECHNICIAN AT THE TIME. THE SAFETY ISSUE ON THIS IS THAT WHILE DRIVING AND ONE NEEDS TO SHIFT TO 5TH GEAR FROM NEUTRAL, ONE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SHIFTING AND THE TRANSMISSION COULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AND AT SUCH FREEWAY SPEED THE VEHICLE COULD SUDDENLY STALL, STOP AND MAY GO IN A TAILSPIN. PREVIOUS DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM REPAIRED THE TRANSMISSION PER THE WARRANTY. NOW I HAVE ANOTHER TOYOTA TACOMA PICK-UP 4X4 HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I TOOK IT TO THE A TOYOTA DEALER PREVIOUSLY SINCE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY FOR POWERTRAIN AND AROUND 55,000 MILES BUT DEALER REFUSED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROBLEM EVEN AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO GET THE PROBLEM CORRECTED. I INFORMED THEM THAT I HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM BEFORE AND THEY HAVE FIXED IT. BUT THIS TIME AROUND THEY REFUSED. I HAVE ATTEMPTED SEVERAL TIMES FROM SEP 2006 UNTIL JAN 2007 AND EVEN CALLED TOYOTA USA REPS ON THE ISSUE.

I USED TO BE AN AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN, AND HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT ALMOST ANY TOYOTA PICKUP TRUCK HAS FRAME RUST PROBLEMS. IT HAS BEEN A WELL KNOW FACT FOR YEARS AND YEARS. WHY DID TOYOTA WAIT SO LONG TO POST A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM. SHORTLY AFTER BUYING MY 2002 I LOOKED AT A OLDER I BELIEVE 1995 TOYOTA PICK-UP THAT I SAW FOR SALE ONE DAY. I WAS LOOKING THE TRUCK OVER AND FOUND THAT THE FRAME WAS ROTTED THROUGH ON THE DRIVERS SIDE JUST BEFORE THE FRONT SPRING SHACK ON THE REAR OF THE TRUCK. IT HAD A HOLE IN THE FRAME ABOUT 2 1/2 INCHES WIDE, AND WHERE THERE WAS FRAME LEFT YOU COULD PUT YOUR FINGER THROUGH IT WITH LITTLE PRESSURE. I DECIDED IT WASN'T ANYTHING I WANTED TO DEAL WITH. NOW I HEARD ABOUT THE RECALL FOR THE FIRST GENERATION TACOMA'S 95-00 ON THE FRAMES ROTTING OUT JUST LIKE THE ONE I LOOKED AT. SO SEEING THAT MY 2002 TACOMA WAS SHOWING PREMATURE FRAME RUST, I DECIDED TO INSPECT IT CLOSER. I FOUND THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE FRAME RUSTING AND FLAKING ON THE OUTSIDE, IT WAS ALSO RUSTING ON THE INSIDE AS WELL. I ALSO FOUND THAT THE WELDS ON THE FRAME FOR THE SPRING HANGERS LOOKED VERY POORLY WELDED AND RUSTY TOO. I BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA SHOULD INCLUDE THE 2000 AND NEWER TACOMA'S IN THEIR FRAME ROT RECALL AS WELL. DOES ANY ONE KNOW IF THEY CHANGED THE QUALITY OF THE METAL USED IN THE FRAMES ON THE NEWER TACOMA'S OR THE DESIGN? HOW DO THEY JUSTIFY THAT THE NEWER TACOMA'S DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM? BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO NEW TO HAVE ROTTED TO THAT POINT YET? THINK ABOUT IT, WHY ELSE WOULD THEY HAVE WAITED SO MANY YEARS TO POST A RECALL ON A TRUCK THAT IS AT THE LEAST 8 YEARS OLD? THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO OWNS A 2ND GENERATION TACOMA WITH THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

A SHORT TIME LATER THE LEFT FRONT OF MY VEHICLE VIOLENTLY FELL TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE VEHICLES BEHIND ME AND WITH DIFFICULTY I STEERED TO THE CURB.
