We were less than 1 mile from our home, headed to school, there was no unsafe conditions, and I don't have any memory of the morning or accident due to severe injury and brain injury, but there's no reason or logical reason for me to be driving in the manner or at the speeds that I was. I passed a car in front of me on a very rural road right as we came upon the almost figure 8 curves on a road I drive everyday. The people I passed and many witnesses including my small child stated that I was gaining more speed as we came to the sharp curves, I crashed at approximately 65-70mph on a 30mph road, there were no brake marks or any sign of an attempt to slow down on my part, but I have too wonder because I am not sure anything that would have made me want to drive that recklessly,  especially when I had my child in the vehicle. My child was asked what was happening before we wrecked and she said she heard a pop sound? And I said \"oh [XXX]\", that was the last thing that happened. We rolled 3x with not one airbag deploying, and the way that the jeep is caved in, I am very much interested in this model being looked over for structural flaws, pictures will be provided.

I HAVE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE AND SOMETIMES IF YOU ARE GOING ON THE HIGHWAY AT THE SPEED AND YOUR CAR CUTS OFF, YOU LOSE POWER AND COULD EASY WRECK. IF I WAS TO PULL OUT AND IT CUT OFF, I COULD BE HIT AND KILLED OR A FAMILY MEMBER IN THE CAR WITH ME. I WAS STRANDED RECENTLY, A GENTLEMAN CAME OVER AND BROUGHT SOME EQUIPMENT WHEN I TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT COULD BE EITHER THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR OR CAMSHAFT SENSOR THAT IS BAD. HE ALSO SAID THERE COULD BE A RECALL ON SOME VEHICLES OF THAT MODEL YEAR.",

I HAD TO HAVE IT SLICED AND MENDED TOGETHER, AFTER 8 MONTHS RECENTLY, I HAD TO REPAIR THE BLACK WIRE AGAIN DUE TO MOISTURE SETTING IN THE TAPE AND WIRES, I READ ON THE INTERNET CHRYSLER SHOULD HAVE NEVER PUT THE BLACK OR YELLOW WHERE'S IN THE DOOR, BECAUSE THEY BEND AND BREAK.     THIS CAUSED MY THE LIGHTS TO STAY ON AND REMOTE SIDE MIRRORS NOT TO WORK. THE DASH BOARD METERS WENT HAYWIRE, I HAD THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED, SENSORS AND  THROTTLE BODY CLEANED AND REPLACED. THE ENGINE LIGHT STAYS ON CONSTANTLY NOW, GIVING CODES OF P0141, P0137 WITH BAD FUEL MPG. IT RIDES LIKE IT IS SMOTHERED IN FEATHERS. I WAS ADVISED THAT IT COULD BE THE FUEL PUMP.  I RECENTLY HAD THE FUEL INJECTORS REPLACED, THE  ENGINE LIGHT WENT OUT, FOR 2 DAY'S AND NOW BACK ON.

I FIND THAT UNSATISFACTORY AND A DISCREDIT TO THE JEEP/CHRYSLER COMPANY WHICH I HAVE PATRONIZED FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.  I ANXIOUSLY AWAIT TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE. ...........A VERY CONCERNED CUSTOMER!!!  *TR",

I HAD THIS ISSUE IN 2009 AFTER AT ABOUT 46,000 MILES. WHEN CALLING THE DEALERSHIP I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THE DEALERSHIP GIVE ME AN EXACT PRICE OVER THE PHONE AS THEY KNEW OF THIS ISSUE. SINCE THE DEALERSHIP WAS VERY RUDE AND PRICE WAS VERY HIGH.I HAD THE REPAIRS DONE AT A HIGHLY REGARDED REPAIR SHOP WHICH SPECIALIZES IN ELECTRICAL WORK WHICH COST $201 BUT NOW (AT 80,000 MILES) THE EXACT SAME ISSUE HAS HAPPENED AGAIN DUE TO THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE DOOR. THE WIRING HARNESS IS LOCATED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR, BUT THE HARNESS IS TOO SMALL TO SUSTAIN ALL OF THE WIRES. WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED, THE WIRES COME OUT OF THE HARNESS AND BREAK, WHICH CAUSES EVERYTHING ON THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR PANEL NOT TO WORK.

THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE CORRECTION OF A FAULTY SYSTEM AT THE LEAST, AND NOT FORCE CUSTOMERS TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THEIR FAULTY SYSTEM. CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A CONCERN FOR THEM WITHOUT FEDERAL MANDATE. *TR",

WE COULDN'T AFFORD THE $250-300 PART, SO WE SIMPLY SCREWED THE WINDOW IN PLACE, TEMPORARILY.  THIS PAST WEEKEND WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 65 MPH OUR PASSENGER WINDOW DID THE SAME THING.  IT WAS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT SO ALL WE COULD DO IS DUCT-TAPE THE WINDOW IN PLACE.  WE CALLED CHRYSLER/JEEP TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY RECALL, AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL.  THEY SIMPLY TOLD US TO GET A $200 DIAGNOSIS FROM A JEEP DEALERSHIP AND THEN THEY WOULD DECIDE IF CHRYSLER/JEEP WOULD ASSIST IN THE COST.  WE VISITED MANY CONSUMER WEBSITES AND FOUND THOUSANDS (NO EXAGGERATION) OF COMPLAINTS OF THE VERY SAME PROBLEM.  THOSE WHO ENDED UP GETTING A DIAGNOSIS WITH A DEALERSHIP NEVER ENDED UP BEING REFUNDED BY CHRYSLER/JEEP.  IN THE END, THEY SIMPLY PAID CHRYSLER/JEEP MORE MONEY HAVING GONE THROUGH THEIR SUGGESTED PROCESS.    THIS IS CLEARLY AND FAULTY PART AND CHRYSLER/JEEP'S REFUSAL TO RECALL OR REIMBURSE ITS CUSTOMERS IS ALARMING.  THE PARTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME NATURE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY CHRYSLER/JEEP MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT IS CLEARLY THEIR PROBLEM.  WEATHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FAILURE OF THE PART(S)--THEY SIMPLY BREAK WITHOUT WARNING.  SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS.  BOTH OF OUR WINDOWS ARE CURRENTLY BEING HELD INTO PLACE  BY SCREW OR TAPE AS WE CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS.  WE DO NOT TRUST CHRYSLER/JEEP AND BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF WE GO TO A DEALERSHIP WE WILL END UP PAYING FOR THE REPAIR ALL ON OUR OWN.

ON JANUARY 10 THE REPAIR COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BECAUSE TWO NEW TIRES, PURCHASED FROM AND MOUNTED BY THE SAME GOODYEAR SERVICE COMPANY, HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE FRONT AND TWO OF THE EXISTING TIRES WITH TREAD HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE BACK PER GOODYEAR'S INSTRUCTIONS.  THE TWO EXISTING TIRES WERE LOWER IN TREAD THAN THE NEW TIRES BY ABOUT AN 1/2 TO 1 INCH AND THEY SAID THIS CAUSED THE FAILURE.  I CHECKED THIS WITH A LOCAL JEEP DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN AND THAT THE TIRE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS.  WHEN I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE TIRE COMPANY THAT MOUNTED THE TIRES ON DECEMBER 1 AND ALSO DID THE SERVICE, THEY SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED FOUR TIRES FROM THEM.  THE TIRE PEOPLE HAD GIVEN A PRICE ON FOUR TIRES BUT SAID THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH TREAD ON THE TWO FRONT TIRES TO CONTINUE TO USE THEM FOR A FEW MONTHS.  THEY DECIDED TO MOVE TWO FRONT TIRES TO BACK AND PUT THE TWO NEW TIRES ON THE FRONT.       THE MECHANICS SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY USING THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE WITH THESE TIRES.   THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT HIS IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL; IT SAYS \"PROPER OPERATION OF FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES DEPENDS ON TIRES OF EQUAL SIZE, TYPE AND CIRCUMFERENCE ON EACH WHEEL.  ANY DIFFERENCE WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT SHIFTING AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE TRANSFER CASE.\"  ALL TIRES MEET THIS.

NOT SURE WHAT A WINDOW REGULATOR WAS, I SEARCHED THE INTERNET, TO LEARN THAT THOUSANDS OF JEEP OWNERS HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE DURING THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF OWNERSHIP.

MY RIGHT FOOT GOT CAUGHT UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL AS I SCRAMBLED FRANTICALLY TO GET INTO THE VEHICLE. MY SHOE CAME OFF, I WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND BY MY OPEN DRIVER'S DOOR & RUN OVER BY MY OWN JEEP.

ALL ROTORS WERE REPLACED WITH GENUINE JEEP PARTS BY A JEEP DEALERSHIP. NOW AT 18100 MILES I NEED NEW FRONT AND REAR BRAKE ROTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE   WARPED. I HAVE TO REPLACE THESE ROTORS AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS RIDICULOUS TO REPLACE ROTORS EVERY 4000 MILES. IT IS A HAZARD, WHEN I COME TO A STOP, THE ENTIRE FRONT END SHAKES!  *JB",

I AM STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND AM GETTING NO WHERE WITH JEEP OR CHRYSLER.  I NOW HAVE OVER 31,000 MILES AND AM NEARING THE END OF MY WARRANTY.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE COMPUTER JUST DIES.  I IMAGINE THE ENGINE WILL STOP ON THE ROAD AND POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO THIS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.  I JUST WANT CHRYSLER TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION SO I CAN BE ASSURED OF A SAFE VEHICLE.  ANOTHER THING IS THEY NEVER GIVE ME PAPERWORK AFTER THEY'VE HAD MY CAR FOR A FEW DAYS TO CHECK THINGS OUT.  THEY ALWAYS TELL ME IT'S STILL OPEN AND WHEN EVERYTHING IS FINISHED THEY'LL GIVE ME PAPERWORK.  *JB",

ONE EVENT, ON 8/15/05, WHEN TRAVELING ON I-66 NEAR FAIRFAX, VA TWO CYLINDERS, NOS. 1 AND 4 MISFIRED AT THE SAME TIME.  THE RESULT WAS AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF POWER DURING ACCELERATION AND LOSS OF SPEED FROM APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH (RATE OF TRAFFIC AT 3 PM RUSH HOUR) TO APPROXIMATELY 25-30 MPH WITHIN 50 YARDS.  THIS INCIDENT NEARLY CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, BECAUSE OTHER VEHICLES HAD TO BRAKE AND SWERVE TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH MINE.  THERE WAS NO WHERE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND CONTINUE AT A SLOWER RATE OF SPEED, UNTIL I COULD MOVE TO THE RIGHT AND STOP IN THE EMERGENCY LANE.  AFTER TURNING THE ENGINE OFF, THE VEHICLE WILL RUN NORMALLY WHEN RESTARTED.  AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, IT HAS MISFIRED 11 TIMES, AND BY STOPPING THE ENGINE, THEN RESTARTING IT, NORMAL OPERATING CAN RESUME.  CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REPAIR THE DEFECT, AFTER HAVING TAKEN IT TO THE SHOP ON NINE OR TEN DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  THEY HAVE REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS, TESTED THE ENGINE FOR CARBON DEPOSIT BUILD-UP ON THE VALVE STEMS, AND REPLACED THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR THAT THE COMPUTER USES TO FIRE THE ENGINE.  NOW, THE MANUFACTURER HAS SAID IT MAY BE THE COMPUTER MODULE, IT MAY BE THE COIL PACK, OR THE ENGINE MAY NEED TO BE DISASSEMBLED TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CARBON BUILD-UP ON THE VALVE STEMS.  THIS CONDITION MAKES THE VEHICLE UNSAFE TO OPERATE, NOT KNOWING WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN, AND IF IT WILL CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO OCCUR.

THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE ABS IS THE PROBLEM, AS WHEN YOU STEP ON THE BRAKES, IT ACTIVATES AND HEATS UP THE ROTORS AND DAMAGES THE CALIPERS BECAUSE THE ABS BRAKES DO NOT RELEASE IN TIME TO COOL OFF THE BRAKING SYSTEM. CHRYSLER REPLACED EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER 13,000 MILES, BUT WILL NOT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR A SYSTEM FAILURE?

THE NEXT SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE WAS AROUND 8000 MILES, AND WE HAD THEM REPLACED AT THAT POINT.  THE ROTORS WARPED SEVERELY AGAIN AROUND 20,000 MILES.  AT WHICH POINT THE DEALER FOOLED MY WIFE INTO PAYING THEM FOR REPLACEMENT CHRYSLER ROTORS AS THE BRAKE WARRANTY WAS NEITHER COVERED UNDER THE 3/36 BUMPER-TO-BUMPER WARRANTY NOR THE 7-70 POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  IF I HAD NOT THOUGHT THEM TO BE UNDER WARRANTY, I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD THE DEALERSHIP REPLACE THEM WITH COMPONENTS OF SUCH SHODDY QUALITY THAT THEY WILL WARP AGAIN INSIDE OF ONE CALENDAR YEAR. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD MY WIFE THAT ROTORS SHOULD ONLY LAST 10,000 MILES.      I AM AN AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICAL ENGINEER. I UINDERSTAND THAT THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ROTOR WARPAGE ARE ONLY HEAT AND INSTALLATION. GIVEN THE USE OF THIS VEHICLE (WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A TOW PACKAGE), EXCESSIVE HEAT CAN BE ELIMINATED.  THE FAILURE MODE ELIMINATES IMPROPER INSTALLATION. POOR QUALITY MATERIAL, NOT ENOUGH MATERIAL, AND INADEQUATE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES COULD CAUSE WARPAGE WITH SIGNIFICNATLY LOWER HEAT THREASHOLD. SINCE CHRYSLER AND NOW DC HAS BEEN HAVING THE PROBLEM FOR DECADES, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED THE CALIPERS IN THE '02 MODEL YEAR, I SUGGEST THAT NHTSA PRESSURE DC TO UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF THE ROTORS. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SHED HEAT AND TAKE THE WEAR OF THE BRAKE PADS ON THEIR SURFACE. IT IS ONE OF THE MORE SIMPLE COMPONENTS IN A VEHICLE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY NOT ONLY REPLACE THE ROTORS FOR ALL GRAND CHEROKEE OWNERS, BUT REPLACE THEM WITH A REPUTABLE NAME (NON DC OEM) ROTORS. THIS WOULD ALLEVIATE ALL ISSUES.",

        "summary": "MY WIFE AND I OWN TWO JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES, A '99 THE AN '04.  IN 1999, JEEP CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THEIR GRAND CHEROKEES AND ONE DESIGN CHANGE POSES A SAFETY RISK TO PASSENGERS IN THE BACK SEATS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN.  MODELS PRODUCED STARTING IN 1999 ALLOW FOR THE WINDOWS IN THE BACK SEATS TO ROLL DOWN, LEAVING A GAP BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE FRAME ON THAT PART OF THE WINDOW CLOSEST TO THE REAR SEAT PASSENGER.  THE 1998 JEEP ALLOWED FOR THE WINDOW TO BE ROLLED DOWN AND THE GAP BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE FRAME WAS AT THE FRONT OF THE WINDOW, FURTHEST FROM THE PASSENGER.  ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS WE HAVE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOWS AND MY CHILDREN (AGES 2 AND 4) , ATTRACTED BY HAVING THE WIND HIT THEIR HAND, HAVE STUCK THEIR FINGERS BETWEEN THIS GAP AREA.  WHEN THE WINDOWS ARE ROLLED UP, THEIR FINGERS GET CRUSHED BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE FRAME.  I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED JEEP ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THEY WERE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT WAS WHETHER MY CHILDREN'S FINGERS WERE BROKEN. THEIR SOLUTION, USE THE WINDOW LOCKS ON THE DRIVER'S CONSOLE.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I CAN ONLY GUARANTEE THEIR HANDS ARE NOT IN THE WINDOWS BY TURNING AROUND AND CONTINUING TO LOOK AS I ROLL THE WINDOWS UP.  THIS IS DISTRACTING AND NOT A SAFE COURSE OF ACTION.  BUT THIS WAS THEIR RECOMMENDATION.  MY WIFE AND I DID NOT PAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR VEHICLES  THAT CAUSE PAIN TO OUR CHILDREN.  WHETHER THEY HAVE BROKEN THEIR FINGERS IS IRRELEVENT AND REALLY SHOWS A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY BY JEEP.  I SPOKE TO REPRESENTATIVES OF JEEP AND THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. FROM OUR CONVERSATION, ONLY IF MY CHIDREN SUFFERED BROKER FINGERS WOULD THEY COMPENSATE US AND/OR CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY, NO BROKEN BONES MEANS ITS NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  I WOULD THINK A COMPANY WOULD RATHER BE PROACTIVE AND NOT REACTIVE.  (THE DATE BELOW IS WHEN THE LATEST INCIDENT OCCURED BUT THIS HAS OCCURED MULTIPLE TIMES.)",

        "summary": "MY 2004 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS A COUPLE POWER OUTLETS; THEY LOOK ALMOST LIKE CIGARETTE LIGHTER RECEPTACLES. THE OUTLETS ARE MARKED \"20A\" INDICATING A 20 AMP CURRENT CAPABILITY.  THE JEEP BOOK ALSO INDICATES THESE POWER OUTLETS ARE ABLE TO CARRY 20 AMPS, AND THE JEEP SHOP MANUAL CALLS THESE 20 AMP CIRCUITS.  WHEN I DISASSEMBLED SOME TRIM TO INSTALL A 2-METER HAM RADIO, I SAW 2 VERY SMALL WIRES CONNECTED TO THE REAR POWER OUTLET.  THE JEEP SHOP MANUAL SAYS THESE ARE 16 GAUGE WIRES.  HERE IS THE PROBLEM:  16 GAUGE WIRES WILL NOT COME NEAR THE ABILITY TO HANDLE 20 AMPS OF CURRENT.  IN FACT, 16 GAUGE WIRE CURRENT CAPACITY IN A CABLE BUNDLE IS AROUND THE 5 OR 6 AMP AREA.  MY HAM RADIO DRAWS 8 AMPS WHEN TRANSMITTING, AND WHEN PLUGGED IN THE JEEP POWER OUTLET, THE VOLTAGE DROP WAS THREE VOLTS.  WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE WIRES CAN SEVERELY OVERHEAT AND BECOME A FIRE HAZARD IF THE CONSUMER BELIEVES THE ADVERTISED 20 AMP CAPABILITY.  I HAVE NO IDEA HOW CHRYSLER/JEEP GETS AWAY WITH THIS.  THERE IS A 20 AMP FUSE IN THIS CIRCUIT, SO ANYONE USING AN INVERTER OR OTHER ACCESSORY THAT ACTUALLY DRAWS 20 AMPS IS GOING TO SERIOUSLY OVERHEAT OR MELT THE WIRING BEFORE THE FUSE BLOWS.  *LA",
