I WANTED TO BE SAFE FOR OUR TRIP. HAD BLOW OUT IN SC WITH ONLY 1917 MILES SINCE WE BOUGHT THE RV.  ROAD SERVICE SUPPLIED AND MECHANIC EXPLAINED THE TIRES WERE DRY ROTTED AND COATED WITH WAX AND ARMORAL TO COVER IT UP!

WE WERE LIED TO AND IT WAS NO LESS THAN A PERSON HOLDING A GUN TO YOUR HEAD WITH PEOPLE LINED UP BEHIND YOU WAITING TO DIE!  I HOPE THAT THE NEXT RV ACCIDENT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.
