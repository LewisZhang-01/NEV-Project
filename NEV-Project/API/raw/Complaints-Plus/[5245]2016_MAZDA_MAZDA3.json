In addition the charging system for my mobile phone has ceased working. This includes both the usb ports and the lighter port which can be adapted with a charger that works in that receptable.   These are all safety issues as far as I am concerned. Not having information related to the vehicle engine light is a big issue, but so is the fact that I can't charge my phone on long distance drives. If I needed assistance, I would be unable to contact anyone without a working cell phone.  Because the display also controls the ability to pair a phone with blue tooth, there is concern for other drivers of the Mazda 3 (mine is a 2016) will be using the phone regardless of the bluetooth malfunction.  I have seen a safety recall on other Mazda's with relation to the infotainment screen, but I do not see one here. I wonder why?  To repair this crucial component would cost many hundreds of dollars -- something I am not in a position to do.  Mazda claims this infotainment center is not under warranty, but with so much important information and safety features embedded into it, I think it should be corrected by recall.
