RECALL TR (CANADA ONLY). ) THIS HAPPENED THIS WINTER -- BELOW 10*F .  IT IS AN EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SITUATION IN TRAFFIC.  I HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AND TURN THE CAR OFF -- PUSHING THE CLUTCH IN CAUSED HIGH REV'S.  IN ADDITION,  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT IDLE WHEN IT WAS BELOW 20*F PUSHING THE CLUTCH IN AT A STOP LIGH WOULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO QUIT.   REPLACING THE IDLE STABILIZER VALVE HELPED THIS ISSUE -- AFTER THE ISV I REMOVED FROM THE CAR SAT INSIDE FOR SEVERAL DAYS I PICKED IT UP TO MOVE IT AND A CLEAR LIQUID RAN OUT WHICH LOOKED A LOT LIKE WATER.  I HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR I HAVE DRIVEN IT DURING THE WINTER AND THIS YEAR I HAVE MOVED 240 MILES FURTHER NORTH WHERE THE WEATHER IS COLDER.  *AK",
