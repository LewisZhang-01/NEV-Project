THIS IS NOW THE FIFTH INCIDENT OF CRACKING RIMS (SIZE 7.5X180 ET52.5) ON MY 2005 JAGUAR X-TYPE (EQUIPPED WITH THE SPORT PREMIUM PACKAGE).  I WENT OUT TO PUT THE GARBAGE OUT ON SUNDAY, 20MAY12, WHEN I NOTICED THE FRONT DRIVER'S TIRE WAS LOW. I CHECKED THE PRESSURE, AND THE GUAGE SHOWED 0.  THAT NIGHT I PUT IN 40 PSI OF AIR.  THE FOLLOWING DAY I CHECKED IT AGAIN, AND THE GUAGE SHOWED 20 PSI.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN USED SINCE 19MAY12 TO THAT POINT.  I JACKED UP THE CAR, AND PULLED THE WHEEL OFF THE CAR.  AFTER SPRAYING WITH SOAPY WATER ON THE INSIDE RIM BY THE SIDEWALL, I FOUND IT WAS BUBBLING.  I PUT THE SPARE ON THE CAR.  LATER I SWITCHED THE SPARE SO IT COULD BE ON THE DRIVER'S REAR (SO IT WOULD NOT BE ON A WHEEL THET STEERS).  ON A WHIM, I CHECKED THE WHEEL THAT WAS ON THE DRIVER'S REAR SIDE AND FOUND IT WAS CRACKED AS WELL.  I SPRAYED SOAPY WATER AND FOUND IT WAS NOT BUBBLING.  I CALLED THE LOCAL JAGUAR DEALER, WHO STATED THEY HAVE NOT HAD ISSUES WITH THEIR RIMS, AND NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THEM.  I FIND THE CRACKING RIMS TO BE A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  MY WIFE AND I HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $600 ON WHEEL REPAIRS.  EVERY FACTORY ORIGINAL WHEEL ON THE CAR HAS BEEN CRACKED; SOME MORE THAN ONCE.  WE HAVE ALSO SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON NEW TIRES BECAUSE THE RIMS WERE CRACKED AND DESTROYED SOME OF THE TIRES' SIDEWALLS. THE MOST RECENT CRACKS WERE DOCUMMENTED VIA PHOTOS FROM MY IPHONE.  I HAVE HEARD OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVING ISSUED WITH THEIR JAGUAR RIMS, YET I HAVE NOT SEEN A RECALL ON THIS ITEM. IT REALLY SHOULD BE.  THIS IS THE CAR WE TAKE OUR FOUR-YEAR-OLD TO DAYCARE.

SUBSEQUENTLY, MICHELIN NOTIFIED THE NHTSA THAT IT WAS RECALLING THESE TIRES FOR A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.  THE TIRES ARE SUBJECT O A NOTICEABLE BLISTER ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE.  MY CAR CURRENTLY HAS 3 TIRES THAT EXHIBITED THIS VERY PROBLEM.  I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR FOR FEAR THE TIRES WOULD POP.  ON JULY 18 MY GREATEST FEAR WAS REALIZED AND THE TIRE DID POP WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE WASHINGTON, DC BELTWAY.  I ARRIVED HOME SAFELY AND CONTACTED MICHELIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO EXPLAIN THAT I SAW THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS WEBSITE REGARDING THE TIRES ON MY JAGUAR.  THE INDIVIDUAL DIRECTED ME TO NATIONAL TIRE AND BATTERY (NTB) TO HAVE THE TIRES REPLACED.    WHEN THE MANAGER AT NBT CONTACTED MICHELIN FOR AUTHORIZATION, HE INITIALLY DENIED MY CLAIM.  WHILE I WAS AT NBT THE 2ND OF 3 AFFLICTED TIRES WHEN FLAT.  MICHELIN SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR COST ASSOCIATED WITH REPLACING THESE DEFECTIVE TIRES.  I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR 40% OF THE COST, WHICH I DEEM VERY UNFAIR.  I HOPE SOMEONE WILL LOOK INTO THIS VERY SERIOUS MICHELIN PILOT SPORT EXTRA LOAD TIRE ISSUE.  THEY ARE PUTTING MANY OF US IN HARM'S WAY.    THERE WAS ANOTHER RECALL BY MICHELIN FOR THE PILOT SPORT EXTRA LOAD TIRES. *JB",
