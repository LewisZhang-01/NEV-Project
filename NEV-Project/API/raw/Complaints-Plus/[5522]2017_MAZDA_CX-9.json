        "summary": "Driving Eastbound on I470 Wheeling WVA going uphill toward Exit 10 Cabela Rd the car lost power and could not get off the roadway. The engine failed and the car lost power steering.  Could not start the car.  The car would turn over, but the engine and battery light were on. The car was sideways in the right lane of traffic unable to be started. State Patrol was called to the area and the vehicle was towed to a Mazda dealer. Mazda dealer determined that the PCM (powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the fuel pump control module) - they noted: \"Found code p064a and in TSB 01-010/17 states that PCM needs to be reprogrammed if no other fuel pump codes are detected, no other fuel pump codes were found.\"  Their explanation was that after driving for a long period of time that the computer no longer allowed fuel to the engine.  Their actions to correct - \"Comments from Service department: We reprogrammed the PCM and cleared codes, test drove and rescanned for codes and found none.\"   This was a known problem by Mazda and they had issued a service bulleting TSB 01-010/17. The bulletin was issued PRIOR to us purchasing the car but the update had not been done on our vehicle, nor had it been done by any Mazda dealer we had taken the car into for service over the past 4 years. This issue that was known by Mazda created a safety issue by shutting off the fuel pump. We were driving at 70 mph on the interstate and could have been hit or worse yet killed. Mazda should have to recall these vehicles and pay for expenses incurred by owners. Mazda will not reimburse us for our expenses. We have contacted them.",
