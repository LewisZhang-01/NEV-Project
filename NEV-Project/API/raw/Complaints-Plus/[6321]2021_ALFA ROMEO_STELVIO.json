        "summary": "As I am merging onto the highway during high traffic, I hear what sounded like a shotgun/explosion. I immediately swerve to the side of the highway, scared, alarmed, and in fear of causing a major accident. As I inspected the car, I noticed no damage to the body but only to find my sunroof glass was shattered. According to the experts, they stated \"there is no apparent impact zone, and if there was, it would show damage inconsistent to what actually occurred here.\" Looking at the images/videos taken from the incident, the sunroof appeared to have imploded outward, and nothing penetrated the glass from outside forces aka. a rock, a bird, debris, etc... The entire sides of the sunroof all broke outwards.   The corporate people at Alfa Romeo said it was due to 'outside forces' but with no evidence of such. This is clearly a manufacturer problem, and if not addressed, can cause severe injuries and in worst case, fatalities. The car has less than 8k miles and is brand new. I am traumatized, concerned and frankly upset about this whole ordeal.",
