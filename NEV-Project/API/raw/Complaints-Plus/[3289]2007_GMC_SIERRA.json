HERE IS THE E-MAIL:  I HAVE A 2007 SIERRA GMC WITH A BACK SEAT THAT HAS MOVEMENT (PLAY) IN IT DUE TO WHAT GM CALLS A \"RATTLE CLIP\" BREAKING.

CONDITION DOES NOT REPRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD.\" I DECLINED THE REPAIR BASED ON THE FACT THERE IS NO KNOWN CAUSE FOR THE FAILURE OF THESE CLIPS EXCEPT FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THEY ARE CHEAP PLASTIC. I DO NOT FEEL REPLACING A PLASTIC CLIP WITH ANOTHER PLASTIC CLIP WILL FIX THE PROBLEM. IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY FAIL AND THE SEAT HAS PLAY IN IT.

SO AGAIN DRIVING AT NIGHT ON 07/04/07 HAD A PROBLEM WITH GLARE AND DISTRACTION FROM VEHICLE  LIGHTS BEHIND ME, SHINING IN PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR.

ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE GLASS AUTO DIMS, ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IT DOES NOT. HOWEVER IT IS TO MY BELIEF GM HAS BUILT THESE TRUCKS THIS WAY TO SAVE MONEY. I ON THE OTHER HAND FEEL THAT IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE SIDE AUTO DIM WHY SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE BOTH SIDES AUTO DIM, DUE TO THE FACT DRIVERS STILL GET BLINDSIDED AND DISTRACTED WHEN THERE ARE BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR. I HAD A 2004 GMC SIERRA WITH BOTH DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE MIRRORS THAT DID AUTO DIM. MANY OF THE 2007 GMC SIERRA TRUCKS ARE BUILT THIS WAY AND I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT SAFE TO THE DRIVER, NOT ONLY IS IT AN ANNOYANCE, NOT ONLY WITH A PERSON SUCH AS MYSELF HAS A SENSITIVITY TO BRIGHT LIGHTS AND GLARE AT NIGHT.
