I know it had fuel in the tank as it only took 11 gallons with my 16 gallon tank.  Installed a new fuel pump, problem continues. This can put someone in a life threatening situation. The first time it happened I was passing a semi truck on a 2 lane Interstate with cars and trucks behind me. Just as I got half way on the semi's left, I'm doing about 70 mph, the engine stalls. Luckily, I kept a cool head and turned on my blinker as the car slowed down. The semi behind me took a hint and backed off so I could coast to the right shoulder.

THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TAKEN THE VEHICLE OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND THAT PULLING BACK INTO THEIR PARKING LOT THERE WAS A BANG AND THEN THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE ANYMORE AND THAT THEY HAD TO PUSH THE VEHICLE BACK INTO THE GARAGE. IN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE I FOUND A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN PUT OUT BY GENERAL MOTORS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE IN OTHER 2008-2013 CADILLAC CTS MODELS EQUIPPED WITH ALL WHEEL DRIVE. I ALSO FOUND THAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO GASKET OR BARRIER BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION OUTPUT SHAFT AND THE TRANSFER CASE INPUT SHAFT. THIS ALLOWS WATER AND/OR MOISTURE TO GET INTO THESE COMPONENTS CAUSING CORROSION WHICH LEADS TO THE \"STRIPPING\" OF THE TRANSMISSION OUTPUT SHAFT. GM HAS CREATED REVISED COMPONENTS TO ALLOW FOR A GASKET BETWEEN THESE COMPONENTS, BUT THIS REQUIRES A COMPLETE TEAR-DOWN OF THE TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFER CASE. I AM NOW FORCED TO PAY FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFER CASE ON THE VEHICLE (BECAUSE I STILL HAVE A LIEN ON IT) AND CADILLAC AND/OR GM ARE REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM OR HELP IN COVERING ANY OF THE REPAIRS.

IT FELT AS IF SOMETHING WAS GOING TO COME THROUGH THE FLOOR AND INTO THE INTERIOR CONSOLE OF THE CAR.  PANIC-STRICKEN, I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE THE CAR AGAIN.  WHEN I CALLED MY HUSBAND, HE INSTRUCTED ME TO DRIVE EXTREMELY SLOWLY TO THE VERY SHORT DISTANCE OF A LOCAL MECHANIC'S GARAGE.UPON INSPECTION THE MECHANIC FOUND THAT THE BOLTS ON THE DRIVESHAFT CONNECTED TO THE TRANSMISSION WERE NEVER TORQUED WHEN THE CAR WAS BUILT AT THE GM PLANT.  MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE BOLTS UNSCREWED AND FELL INTO HIS HAND WITHOUT USING A WRENCH AND SEVERAL OF THE BOLTS WERE SHEARED OFF, CAUSING THE DRIVESHAFT TO COME AWAY FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND ALMOST PENETRATE THE FLOOR OF THE CAR.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THE ENTIRE DRIVESHAFT HAD TO BE REPLACED WITH A NEW DRIVESHAFT.  WHEN THIS OCCURRED THE MILEAGE WAS ONLY 70,751 MILES. THIS SERVICE WAS PERFORMED BY BLESSING'S SERVICE LLC, 19 WEST SHORE TRAIL, SPARTA, NJ 07871 AT A COST OF $1,024.39.  ALL OTHER SERVICE PERFORMED ON THIS CAR PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT WAS PERFORMED BY MECHANICS AT MY DEALERSHIP, BROGAN CADILLAC LOCATED IN TOTOWA, NEW JERSEY.",

SUDDENLY, THE ENGINE TOOK OFF AND REVVED UP TO AROUND 4000RPMS, SO MUCH I COULD HARDLY HOLD IT WITH THE BRAKES.  I  PUT IN PARK AND REACHED DOWN TO FEEL THE FLOOR MAT TO SEE IF IT WAS ON THE ACCELERATOR.  IT WAS NOT.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR.  THE NEXT DAY, I TOOK IT TO THE GM DEALER.  I DON'T THINK THEY BELIEVED ME BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT REPEAT THE CONDITION.  THEY HAD ME LEAVE THE CAR AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT.  THE NEXT DAY I PICKED UT UP.  THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD RE-PROGRAMMED THE THROTTLE BODY CONTROL UNIT.  I LEFT WITH THE CAR AND PROCEEDED TO EXIT THE LOT.  JUST AS I GOT TO THE STREET, IT TOOK OFF AGAIN, REVVING TO ABOUT 4000 RPMS OR SO.  I IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK AND TOLD THE DEALER WHAT HAPPENED.  THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER AND SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS.  THEY NEVER FIXED THE PROBLEM.  I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE IN THE THROTTLE CONTROL SYSTEM, JUST LIKE TOYOTA IS DEALING WITH.  IF MY WIFE HAD BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR, SHE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND NEEDS ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY,.  IT IS NOT JUST TOYOTA. *TR",
