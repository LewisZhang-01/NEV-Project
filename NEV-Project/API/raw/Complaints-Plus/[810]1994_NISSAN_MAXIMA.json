THE CAR HAS BEEN CHECKED FOR FAULTY FUEL INJECTORS, THE HOSING HAS BEEN CHECKED, THE FUEL FILTER CHANGED.  THERE ARE NO \"CLEAN SPOTS\" INDICATING GAS LEAKAGE ON AN OLD DIRTIER ENGINE.  ODOR IS SO STRONG AT TIMES THAT THE CAR HAS TO BE PARKED OUTSIDE THE GARAGE AT HOME FOR FEAR THAT A SPARK FROM THE HOT WATER HEATER WILL IGNITE THE FUMES.  ALSO, FIRE FROM ENGINE HEAT IS A CONCERN AS IS DRIVING THE CAR AND HAVING ANOTHER MOTORIST TOSS OUT A CIGARETTE BUTT.
