I WAS DRIVING FROM STATEN ISLAND TO FLUSHING TO PICK UP MY FRIEND TO GO BACK TO MY HOME. ALONG THE 495 HIGHWAY, WE WERE DRIVING AROUND 45-50 MPH AND SUDDENLY A WARNING POPPED UP ON THE ABS SYSTEM SAYING THAT THE \"BREAKER IS ON.\" WE BECAME REALLY NERVOUS SO WE WANTED TO CHECK OUT WHY THAT MESSAGE CAME ON. THERE WAS A CAR ABOUT 100 METERS IN FRONT OF US, SO I STEPPED ON THE BREAKS, BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO STEP DOWN ON IT. THE BRAKE IS COMPLETELY LOCKED AND HAD NO WAY TO SLOW IT DOWN AND WITHIN TWO SECONDS WE HIT THE CAR IN FRONT, AND OUR CAR WAS TOTALED. FORTUNATELY, NOBODY HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AFTER WE GOT HOME I FELT DIZZY AND EARS WERE RINGING. FORTUNATELY, I FELT BETTER AFTER A COUPLE DAYS. WE ALSO TRIED CONTACTING DIFFERENT LAWYERS, BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD TAKE OUR CASE BECAUSE THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF ME BEING INJURED OR ANY OTHER DOCTOR REPORTS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THAT ONLY IF SOMEONE GOT HURT AND WAS BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL WOULD THERE BE A SERIOUS CASE. IS THIS REALLY HOW AMERICA HANDLES SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENTS?  WE HOPE THAT LEXUS CAN BE FAIR AND HAVE SOMEONE INSPECT THE BLACK BOX TO SEE IF IT WAS THE CAR ITSELF THAT HAD AN ISSUE. WE ALSO WISH THAT THEY WILL GIVE US A SINCERE APOLOGY, RESPECT, AND JUST A FAIR ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM.",
