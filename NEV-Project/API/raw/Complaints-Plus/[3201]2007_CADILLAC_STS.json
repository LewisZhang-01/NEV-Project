I RECENTLY NOTICED MY AIR BAG LIGHT SENSOR WAS INTERMITTENTLY TURNING ON AND OFF AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT INTO EARNHARDT CADILLAC OF SCOTTSDALE FOR FEAR OF A SAFETY ISSUE. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM STEVEN FROM SERVICES WHO EXPLAINED THAT THE WIRING HARNESS WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED BEFORE HE COULD EVEN FURTHER DIAGNOSE THE AIR BAG WIRING ISSUE. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE AIR BAG WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE HARNESS ITSELF WOULD BE $485 AND ONLY ONCE HE REPAIRED THAT WOULD HE BE ABLE TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE AIR BAG ISSUE. I ASKED IF CADILLAC STANDS BEHIND THE REPAIR OF SUCH A SAFETY CONCERN AND HE SAID ONLY UNDER THE WARRANTY AND ALSO STATED THERE WAS NO RECALLS ON THIS CAR MODEL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE WOULD HAVE SUCH A HORRIFIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT CADILLAC IS NOT WILLING TO REPAIR OR REPLACE. I'M REACHING OUT TO YOU TO SEE IF INDEED THAT IS THE CASE OR IF CADILLAC WOULD BE WILLING TO REPAIR THIS SAFETY HAZARD. I HAD A HONDA SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THE AIR BAG WAS REPLACED IMMEDIATELY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS. I'M HOPING CADILLAC WOULD STAND BEHIND ITS REPUTATION AND DO THE SAME.

THE HEADLIGHTS FAILED THE INSPECTION.  #2 OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, CONDENSATION BUILT UP INSIDE BOTH THE HEADLIGHTS.  IN THE PAST MONTH, I NOTICED THERE WAS ONE INCH OF WATER IN THE DRIVER SIDE HEADLIGHT.  THE WATER HAS NOW SHORTED OUT THE LIGHT.  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS A DEFECT AND I HAVE READ SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON CAR FORUMS ON THE INTERNET.  CADILLAC WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR BECAUSE THE CAR NOW HAS 63,000 MILES.

ON RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE OCCASIONS WHILE MAKING A SHARP TURN ON DRY PAVEMENT AT RELATIVELY LOW SPEED  AT APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH THE STABILITY SYSTEM  ACTIVE MESSAGE OR TRACTION ACTIVE MESSAGE WOULD BE DISPLAYED ON THE DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER AND THE CAR WOULD LOSE POWER TO ALL 4 WHEELS AND SLOW ALMOST TO A STOP EVEN WHILE THE GAS PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED - IT WOULD SEEM TO STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION!  ON MAY 26, 2007 R.C. OLSEN CADILLAC REPLACED THE YAW SENSOR TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM , BUT EVIDENTLY THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM WHICH I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE AT RANDOM, INFREQUENTLY,  AND UNPREDICTABLE OCCASIONS.  THERE SEEMS TO BE A SLIGHT LOOSENESS IN THE STEERING WHEN TURNED WHICH USUALLY OCCURS AT LOW SPEED (LESS THAN 5 MPH) AT THE BEGINNING OF A SHARP TURN WITH PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE STEERING WHEEL (MOST OFTEN OCCURS WHEN STEERING WHEEL IS PULLED TOWARD THE DRIVER).  IT FEELS LIKE A 1/8 INCH \"SLIP\" OR \"JERK\" IN THE WHEEL.  THE OCCURRENCE IS MOST NOTICEABLE WHEN TURNING WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE OR WHEN MAKING AN INITIAL TURN AFTER BEING STOPPED.  IT HAPPENS IN FORWARD AND REVERSE BUT I SEEM TO NOTICE IT MORE IN REVERSE BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN I SEEM TO BE PUTTING REARWARD PRESSURE ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE TURNING.  I SUSPECT THAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE ELECTRONIC ADJUSTMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  NOTE HOWEVER THAT ON MY MOST RECENT SERVICE VISIT ON JUNE 27, 2007, WOODWARD CADILLAC OF ANDOVER, MA FOUND THAT THE FRONT END WAS SEVERELY OUT OF LINE AND SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMED AN ALIGNMENT ON THE CAR WHICH DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM BUT SEEMED TO SLIGHTLY IMPROVE IT - THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE ORIGINATING FROM THE FRONT END OR RACK.  I HAVE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE ON THIS ISSUE 5 TIMES ALL WITH THE RESULT THAT THE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THEREFORE COULD NOT FIX IT.
