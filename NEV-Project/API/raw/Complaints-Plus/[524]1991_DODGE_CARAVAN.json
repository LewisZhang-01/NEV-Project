CONSEQUENCE:  IF THIS CONDITION OCCURS, THE ABS FUNCTION COULD BE LOST AND REDUCED POWER ASSIST WOULD BE EXPERIENCED DURING VEHICLE BRAKING INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR A VEHICLE ACCIDENT.  REMEDY:  DEALERS WILL TEST THE VEHICLE'S ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM AND REPAIR THE VEHICLES IF NECESSARY. (EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKE ACTUATOR PISTON ASSEMBLY AND THE PUMP-MOTOR ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL HAVE A LIFETIME COVERAGE).     THE THING I FIND HERE IS THE TERM REGARDING PISTON ASSEMBLY WHEN I TOOK MY VAN IN DUE TO FAILURE ONLY THE PISTON ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED IT SHOULD BE REVISED TO INCLUDE THE WHOLE UNIT BECAUSE A ACCUMULATOR MADE OF CAST IRON THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE UNIT IS NEVER REPLACED RUST KEEPS ENTERING THE UNIT FROM THIS ACCUMULATOR BEING IT IS MADE OF A RUSTING METAL AND JUST KEEPS MAKING THE UNIT FAIL THIS IS MY SECOND REPAIR IN 2YRS AND THE RUST IS NOW GETTING INTO THE LINES CAUSING THE REAR WHEELS TO LOCK IN WET WEATHER ALL THE PARTS STORES THAT EVEN CARRY THE UNIT WHICH IS FEW SELL IT AS A COMPLETE UNIT NOT IN PIECES SUCH AS WITH OTHER MASTER CLY. 'S WITHOUT ABS I FIND CAST IRON A POOR CHOICE FOR A AIR TANK OF A AIR PUMP WHICH BY NATURE INJECTS AIR INTO THE METAL CAST IRON TANK STAINLESS STEEL WOULD BEEN A BETTER CHOICE IF IT WOULD MEET THE TANK PRESSURES.

CHRYSLER HAS REPAIRED THE PROBLEM ON THE FIRST TWO OCCASIONS AT NO CHARGE AND APPEARS THAT THEY WILL DO THE SAME AGAIN. THEY HAVE ALSO ISSUED A LETTER INDICATING THAT FOR THE LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE THEY WILL DO THE SAME. THE PROBLEM HOWEVER, AS I HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO CHRYSLER'S CUSTOMER CENTER IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESTINED TO CONTINUE TO FAIL. THIS IS A SERIIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM. WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT NO MISHAPS HAVE YET OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURES, HOWEVER THIS CAN NOT BE ASSURED IN THE FUTURE. THE PEDAL PRESSURE REQUIRED AND THE ROAD AWARENESS REQUIRED DURING FAILURE MAY BE MORE THAN EITHER MY WIFE OR DAUGHTER IS CAPABLE OF. I HAVE ASKED CHRYSLER TO REPLACE THE SYSTEM WITH ONE THAT HAS GOOD TRACK RECORD SUCH AS IN LATER MODEL VANS. THE ANSWER CONTINUES TO BE \"CHRYSLER WILL REPAIR THE SYSTEM FREE OF CHARGE WHENEVER IT FAILS.\" I BELIEVE THEY NEED TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE AND INSURE THE FUTURE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY BY REPLAING, NOT REPAIRING, A DEFECTIVE SYSTEM.

THE FIRST GARAGE REPLACED THE FUSIBLE LINK, SEPARATED THE WIRES IN THE LINK, AND THEN REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH ALL TO NO AVAIL. THEN THE VAN WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER AND THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THEM WAS A SHORT IN THE FUEL PUMP.  THE NEXT DAY THE VAN AGAIN STOPPED, THE DEALER SAID THEY HAD ERRED BY ACCIDENTLY PINCHING THE GROUND WIRE OF THE FUEL PUMP WHILE INSTALLING IT.  EACH TIME THE VAN WAS REPAIRED I WAS TOLD THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  WHEN I CALLED DODGE HEADQUARTERS TO INQUIRE IF THEY HAD HEARD OF SIMILIAR PROBLEMS OR COMPLAINTS I WAS TOLD BY THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON THAT THEY COULD NOT RESPOND TO MY QUESTION.   I HOPE THAT THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION HAS BEEN REPAIRED THIS TIME.  I'M CONCERNED THAT THE VAN WOULD SUDDENTLY STOP WITHOUT ANY WARNING AT ANY SPEED DAY OR NIGHT.
