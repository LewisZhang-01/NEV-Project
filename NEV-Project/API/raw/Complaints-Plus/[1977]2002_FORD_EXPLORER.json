THE BRAKE LIGHT PROBLEM HAD ELUDED ME UNTIL I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH ON THE INTERNET WHICH RESULTED IN HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF PEOPLE ALL EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.      CALLING THE FORD DEALER AND PROVIDING THE PART NUMBER (E6DB14489DA) ON THE CONNECTOR PROVED FUTILE IN HAVING THEM EVEN IDENTIFY THE PART YET I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE PART ON THE INTERNET JUST BE A GOOGLE SEARCH. AT THIS POINT, I AM UNABLE TO LOCATE A REPLACEMENT PART SO I AM FORCED TO HOT GLUE THE WIRES INTO THE BROKEN CONNECTOR IN ORDER TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE.   *TR",

I ASSUMED I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING A TIRE BLOW-OUT AND BEGAN SLOWLY BREAKING AND LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY I MADE IT ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE. MY TIRE HOWEVER WAS NOT AS LUCKY. ALL 5 STUDS ON MY RIGHT REAR TIRE SNAPPED CAUSING THE TIRE TO COMPLETELY FLY OFF AND PROCEED DOWN THE ROAD AT A FAST SPEED JUST PASSING THE TURN RAMP AND MISSING SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES. IN THE PROCESS OF LOSING THE TIRE, IT ALSO CAUSED DAMAGE TO REAR END OF MY SUV. IT LOOKED AS IF THE TIRE GOT CAUGHT AND CAUSED THE REAR TO DENT IN.REPLACED STUDS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE. TODAY (DEC.15TH) NOT EVEN AN ENTIRE MONTH LATER, VEHICLE STARTED SHAKING AGAIN. OH HOW I REMEMBERED THAT SCARY SHAKE. EXAMINED TIRE AND ONCE AGAIN, STUDS SNAPPED. 2 THIS TIME WITH A THIRD ONE MISSING THE CAP. THE TIRE WAS ONLY HELD BY 2 STUDS. THANK THE LORD I NOTICED THIS PROBLEM BEFORE GOING ONTO THE INTERSTATE AND ONCE AGAIN HAVING MY TIRE FLY OFF! I HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH THIS EVENING TO FIND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 02-04 EXPLORERS. PLEASE MAKE A RECALL FORD AND OTHERS HELP ME TO GET ONE MADE!

I THINK ITS OUTRAGEOUS THAT WE, THE OWNERS, HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR WHEN ITS NOT OUR FAULT. I FEEL LIKE SINCE THE TRANSMISSIONS FOR THIS CAR IS FAULTY AND IS KNOWN TO FAIL AT VARIOUS TIMES AND MILES, WHICH ARE TOO LOW FOR A TRANSMISSION TO FAIL, FORD SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION CAN FAIL AT ANYTIME WHICH HAVE CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS AND WILL CAUSE MORE ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS UNTIL FORD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND RECALL THE TRANSMISSIONS.

I COULD NOT TELL WHAT HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT IT WAS BROKEN OFF  THE STEERING COLUMN.

RECENTLY MY VEHICLE BECAME VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  WHEN I ACCELERATE AND THEN RELEASE THE PEDAL THE VEHICLE WOULD \"PUSH\" TO ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER. ALSO GOING AROUND CURVES I WOULD GET A \"DEATH WOBBLE\" WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD \"PUSH\" FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN ALMOST A SWINGING MOTION AND WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO CORRECT IT, IT CONTINUES TO SWING EXCESSIVELY BACK AND FORTH.  TONIGHT I WENT TO CHECK MY WHEEL BEARINGS THINKING THIS WAS THE PROBLEM,  AND I FOUND 3 OUT OF THE 4 COIL SPRINGS ON THE STRUTS WERE BROKEN.  BOTH REAR COILS WERE SHATTERED (EASIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT) AT THE TOP OF THE SPRING.  I COULD LITERALLY PULL PIECES OF COIL SPRING OUT OF THE COIL.  THE FRONT RIGHT SPRING WAS ALSO CRACKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH, NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE COIL.  I HAVE SPENT ALOT OF TIME WORKING ON CARS AND I HAVE NEVER SEE 3 COIL SPRINGS FAIL AT THE SAME TIME ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY ARE LESS THAN 10 YEARS OLD!!!  I ALSO DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND READ WHERE OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD SPRING FAILURES AS LOW AS 75,000 MILES!! PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE ON THE ROAD. I WORK IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS I FEEL IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK AFTER EXPERIENCING THE LOSS OF CONTROL YOU HAVE WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE IN THIS CONDITION.  IF THIS WOULD  HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ILLINOIS WINTER WITH ICE ON THE ROADS IT COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.  I WILL BE REPLACING THE ENTIRE STRUT/COIL SPRING ASSEMBLY SING THE REAR SPRINGS HAVE COLLAPSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SPRING IS RUBBING ON THE STRUT BODIES.  ONE OF THE ISSUES IS, WITH EXCEPTION OF THE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, THE VEHICLE SITS LEVEL AND CLOSE TO ITS NORMAL RIDE HEIGHT  AND ITS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL 3 SPRINGS ARE BROKEN.  I WILL BE TAKING PICTURES TO DOCUMENT THIS FAILURE AND I WILL BE WILLING TO PROVIDE THIS TO YOU.  I MAY ALSO SAVE THE OLD PARTS IF YOU WOULD LIKE.  *TR",

I WAS ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE, AND MY TRUCK BEGAN SWERVING TO THE POINT THAT I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT, AND I HAD TO PULL OVER. WHEN I GOT OUT, I PULLED THE LUG COVER OFF THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL TO FIND THAT FOUR OF THE FIVE LUGS WERE SNAPPED. I HAD TO PAY $400 TO HAVE IT TOWED, AND WHEN IT GOT TO THE GARAGE, THEY FOUND THAT THE WHEEL BEARINGS AND HUB WERE DAMAGED. THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR WHEEL, AND, AGAIN, THE LUGS SNAPPED AND THEY FOUND THE HUB AND WHEEL BEARINGS TO BE THE CAUSE OF IT. THIS WAS ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT. THE THIRD INCIDENT INVOLVED BOTH FRONT WHEELS, BUT LUCKILY ONLY THE WHEEL BEARINGS AND HUBS WERE DAMAGED AND MY WHEELS STAYED IN PLACE. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT NOVEMBER OF 2010. IN JANUARY OF 2011, THE REAR WENT AGAIN. THIS TIME IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOW STORM, SO I HAD TO WAIT IN THE FREEZING COLD FOR TWO HOURS UNTIL THE TOW TRUCK COULD COME. CURRENTLY, MY VEHICLE IS SITTING IN A GARAGE TO HAVE YET ANOTHER WHEEL BEARING REPLACED BECAUSE IT HAS FAILED.

ON MONDAY I GOOGLED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A DEFECT IN FORD EXPLORERS - '02 - '04.  I CONTACTED THE FORD COMPANY WHO TOOK MY COMPLAINT AND REFERRED ME TO MY NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP.  IN SPEAKING WITH THE REP AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT A \"SAFETY DEFECT\" AND THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE ESTIMATED COST WOULD BE BETWEEN $450-500.  I ALSO READ THAT BACK IN 2006 WHEN THIS DEFECT OCCURRED THAT FORD WAS PROVIDING A \"SPECIAL ASSISTANCE OUT-OF-WARRANTY\" ON EXPLORERS WHERE THEY WOULD PAY ALL BUT $100.  NOW APPARENTLY SINCE JAN. 2007 THEY HAVE STOPPED THIS AND NOT THE OWNERS ARE TO PAY FOR THE FULL COST OF THE REPAIR.

[XXX] SUSTAINED MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE INJURIES FROM WHICH HE DIED.    THE SEAT BACK IN THE 2002 EXPLORER IS ATTACHED TO A RECLINER MECHANISM ON EACH SIDE OF THE SEAT.  THE RECLINER MECHANISMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEAT CUSHION FRAME BY SPIRAL COIL PINS.  WHEN THE EXPLORER WAS STRUCK FROM THE REAR, THE VEHICLE MOVED FORWARD IN RELATION TO [XXX] BODY, CAUSING HIS BODY TO LOAD THE DRIVER'S SEAT BACK.  AS THIS OCCURRED, THE FORCE OF THE SEAT BACK BEING MOVED REARWARD BY [XXX] BODY CAUSED THE RECLINER MECHANISMS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SEATS TO MOVE FORWARD; AS THEY DID SO, THEY CONTACTED THE SPIRAL COIL PINS, AND FRACTURED THOSE PINS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SEAT.  WHEN THE SPIRAL COIL PINS FAILED, THE SEAT BACK COLLAPSED ONTO THE REAR SEAT CUSHION, AND [XXX] WAS EJECTED INTO THE CARGO AREA OF THE EXPLORER AND THEN OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW GLAZING.

IN THE CASE OF [XXX], BECAUSE THE SPIRAL COIL PINS WERE NOT INSERTED FAR ENOUGH INTO THE MATING HOLES WHEN MANUFACTURED, THE PINS ON HIS SEAT WERE FRACTURED BY THE RECLINER MECHANISMS AND FAILED TO HOLD HIS SEAT BACK UPRIGHT IN THE COLLISION.

THOUGHT MY TRUCK WOULD BE REPAIRED IN A DAY, BUT THEY HAD MY TRUCK FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.  I REC.'D A CALL ON FRIDAY OF THAT WEEK AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD DROPPED THE PAN ON MY TRANSMISSION AND FOUND A \"GEAR\" LAYING IN THE PAN.  I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED MY TRANSMISSION REPLACED.  THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, I TOOK THE TRUCK BACK (AS IS) AND TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP FOR A SECOND OPINION.  A BROKEN WIRING HARNESS IN MY STEERING COLUMN WAS DIAGNOSED AS THE PROBLEM AND IT WAS REPAIRED FOR $230.88.  I REC.'D MY TRUCK BACK ON A THURSDAY.  IT DROVE FINE THAT DAY.  I DROVE IT OUT OF TOWN THAT FRIDAY AND RETURNED HOME SATURDAY.  TWO WEEKS AFTER THIS PROBLEM BEGAN, I LEFT MY HOME ON A MID-SUNDAY MORNING AND THE PROBLEM STARTED AGAIN WITH THE FLASHING OD LIGHT AND A HESITANT TRANSMISSION.  I WAS ABLE TO RUN MY FEW ERRANDS AND GET BACK HOME.  I, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM, THINKS FORD SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.  THIS IS THE FIRST FORD I'VE EVER OWNED AND I, PERSONALLY, DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF MY TRUCK.  I REC.'D AN EXCEPTIONAL DEAL ON IT AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT STILL HAS A LOT OF GOOD LEFT IN IT.  I HAVE NO BLAME TO PLACE ON MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP OR THE TRANSMISSION SHOP.  THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH FORD ITSELF.  A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ISSUED SO THAT THEIR DEALERSHIPS CAN MAKE THE PROPER REPAIRS TO THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE A 2YR DAUGHTER AND I SPEND ABOUT 75% OF MY TIME IN THAT VEHICLE WITH HER.  I NEED PEACE OF MIND THAT MY VEHICLE IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR ME AS I TAKE CARE OF IT WITH PROPER SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD BY SERVICE DEPT THAT FORD RECALL 04S20 (PERFORMED IN 2004) WAS ONLY WARRANTEED FOR 1 YEAR, SO I PURCHASED NEW HINGE KIT (2L2Z-78420A68-AA) AND INSTALLED MYSELF. AFTER EXAMINING OLD PARTS, I NOTICED SIGNIFICANT REDESIGN.  AFTER DISCUSSION WITH A FORD SERVICE MANAGER IT APPEARS THAT INITIAL RECALL REPAIRS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND BY HIS ESTIMATE THE HINGES LAST ABOUT 3 YEARS. THERE WERE SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RECALLED PARTS AND PROCEDURES SINCE 12/04.  MY VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED 12/20/04 SO THE MOST RECENT PROCEDURE WAS NOT FOLLOWED AT THE TIME AND MOST RECENT PARTS WERE NOT INSTALLED.  FORD WILL NOT COMPENSATE FOR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ONCE ANY RECALL REPAIR WAS COMPLETED.  I WAS NOT INJURED BECAUSE I WAS OPENING THE HATCH SLOWLY AND HAD NOT LET GO BEFORE THE HINGE BROKE AND THE GLASS FELL.   I BELIEVED THAT THE SAFETY DEFECT HAD BEEN REPAIRED.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THE DANGER STILL EXISTS. I SUGGEST A WARNING NOTICE BE SENT TO ALL OWNERS THAT HAD RECALL PERFORMED BEFORE THE FINAL PROCEDURES (RCRIT-04V442-7848) WERE DEVELOPED.  IT WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE FORD TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRS FOR THE DEFECTIVE RECALL REPAIR - INCLUDING GLASS BREAKAGE - AS THEY DID FOR THE ORIGINAL RECALL. *TR",

I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OUT A LOAN JUST TO FIX THE CAR THAT I'M STILL PAYING OFF.   IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL OR THAT FORD HAS MADE IT SO THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE COLUMN INSTEAD OF THE ONE LITTLE PART THAT BROKE. *TR",

THE VERY NEXT DAY AGAIN, WITH THE LIGHT ONCE AGAIN FLASHING, THE VEHICLE REFUSED TO MOVE FORWARD WHEN GAS PEDAL WAS ENGAGED; HOWEVER THE RPM REVVED UP BETWEEN 3 AND 4. THROUGHOUT THAT SAME DAY,  I ATTEMPTED TO GET VEHICLE INTO DRIVE MODE...EVENTUALLY THE VEHICLE JUST INCHED FORWARD AND FINALLY STOPPED MOVING ALTOGETHER.  AFTER A CONSULTATION WITH MY LOCAL TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP.. I WAS DISHEARTEN TO LEARN THAT IN ORDER TO REPAIR, WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A BAD TRANSMISSION, WHICH IS VERY COMMON WITH THE 2002 FORD EXPLORERS..I'D HAVE TO PAY $2868....SINCE THIS INCREDIBLE REVELATION, I'M DISCOVERING FORD KNOWS ALL ABOUT BUT REFUSES TO DO THE CONSCIONABLE THING AND RECALL THESE DEFECTIVE, DANGEROUS BUT COSTLY VEHICLES. I REGRETTABLE PAID THE $2868 REPAIR CHARGE FOR A REBUILT TRANNY WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ASSISTANCE FROM FORD. MY VEHICLE IS PAID OFF AND I REALLY CANT AFFORD TO JUST INVEST CLOSE TO 3K IN A VEHICLE THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN RECALLED AND FIXED ESPECIALLY SINCE THE FORD CORPORATION IS FULLY AWARE BUT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO STILL BUY AMERICAN AND WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS.  BUT SINCE FORD REFUSES TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT, IT MAY FORCE A LOYAL CUSTOMER TO GO ELSEWHERE IN THE FUTURE WHEN PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE WAS RECENTLY REPAIRED ON 2/8/10.. SO FAR I'VE DRIVEN IT ONCE... SO FAR SO GOOD...I RECEIVED A BETTER WARRANTY FROM MY TRANNY SHOP THAN THE FORD COMPANY WAS WILLING TO STAND BEHIND. THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR AJAR ALARM CHIMES WHILE DOOR IS SECURELY CLOSED.  THE LOCKING MECHANISM OPENS AND CLOSES.

THE FIRST INCIDENT HAPPENED IN FEBRUARY 2007 WHEN MY RIGHT FRONT BEARING BROKE WHILE I WAS ON AN HIGHWAY OVERPASS DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH  AND ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE AS THE WHEEL NEARLY COMES OFF WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND THE VEHICLE JERKS.  THE TRUCK WAS TOWED INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.  THE SECOND INCIDENT HAPPENED IN JANUARY 2008 WHEN MY LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING BROKE.  THIS TIME I WAS THANKFULLY NOT ON THE EXPRESSWAY BUT ONCE AGAIN THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR AS IT WAS NOT DRIVABLE.  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS IN FOR REPAIR THIS TIME I REQUESTED THAT THE REAR BEARINGS BE CHECKED AND REPLACED IF NECESSARY AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THOSE TWO BEARINGS ALSO NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  NOW, IN OCTOBER 2009, ONCE AGAIN MY FRONT LEFT WHEEL BEARING IS LOSE AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  I CALLED FORD REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BEARINGS ARE FAULTY AND THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED DUE TO THIS ISSUE BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER JUST SAYS TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.  THEY ALSO WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR AS IT IS OUT OF THEIR 12 MONTH OR 12,000 MILE WARRANTY PERIOD. I HAVE STARTED RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE AND HAVE FOUND 28 PAGES OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND THIS IS JUST ONE WEBSITE.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON OCCURRENCE  WITH THE BEARINGS ON 2002 EXPLORERS.    THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SEALED FACTORY PART THAT USUALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE REPAIR AND I AM ON MY FIFTH REPAIR.  I AM CONCERNED FOR MY OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS. *TR",

WE HAD NO RECENT WORK ON THE TIRES OR THE VEHICLE THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY LOOSEN THE LUG NUTS FOR EITHER OCCURRENCE.

THE SAD PART ABOUT ALL THIS IS FORD KNOWS THAT THIS PROBLEM EXSIST AND IS WILLING TO LET ITS CUSTOMERS TAKE THE RISK OF INJURY IF THE TRANSMISSION GIVES OUT ON A BUSY INTERSTATE. LORD KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF SOMEONE DIES IN THAT ACCIDENT. *TR",

WHILE HAVING THIS SERVICED, I WAS TOLD THAT THE REAR SPRINGS WERE BROKEN AND THE STRUTS ALSO NEED REPLACED.  THE FIRST ESTIMATE FOR THE REAR SPRINGS AND STRUTS WAS $780!  SO FAR ON THE 2002 EXPLORER I HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT (50K MILES), OD SENSOR REPLACED (45K MILES), ABS SENSOR REPLACED (45K MILES), REAR CONTROL ARM REPLACED (75K MILES), FRONT STRUTS (78K MILES), AND REAR LATCH REPLACED (RECALL).  THE EMERGENCY BRAKE (75K MILES) ALSO NEEDED REPLACED.  WHEN THE CONTROL ARM WAS REPLACED, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE CRUMBLED APART.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT I AM LUCKILY THE BROKEN SPRING DID NOT PIERCE THE TIRE AND CAUSE A BLOWOUT.  THE SPRINGS/STRUTS AND THE TRANSMISSION ARE COMMON PROBLEMS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED.  BETWEEN PAYING OUT OF POCKET AND THE ISSUES COVERED BY AN AFTER MARKET WARRANTY, OVER $5000 HAVE BEEN SPENT ON A VEHICLE 7 YEARS OLD WITH ONLY 79000 MILES.  THIS VEHICLE HAS NEVER TOWED ANYTHING OR BEEN DRIVEN OFF ROAD. *TR",

IT IS NO WONDER SO MANY TRANSMISSIONS EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM.\"  YOU WOULD THINK WHEN MY TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED THE 1ST TIME THAT FORD WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY PUTTING BRASS CASINGS ON THE PINS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.  NOW, I'M HAVING TO GET A 2ND TRANSMISSION, & SINCE I DIDN'T TAKE IT TO FORD, THEY ARE REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION WITH THIS FIX IMPLEMENTED.  I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BEAR THE $3500 NEEDED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  FORD SHOULD STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS, BUT SINCE THEY WON'T, I HOPE THAT YOU CAN REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO!  THANKS!

IN 2008 I HAD ROUTINE BRAKE REPLACEMENT DONE ON MY VEHICLE AT A LOCAL GARAGE AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE TECHNICIAN WORKING ON THE VEHICLE NOTICED THAT MY REAR COIL SPRINGS WERE BROKEN AND NEARLY FELL OUT. I HAD THIS PROBLEM REPLACED WITH NEW SHOCKS AND SPRINGS AND DID NOT THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD LOW MILEAGE. NOW JUST RECENTLY WITH 61000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE THE O/D LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH AGAIN, I HAD PROBLEMS SHIFTING FROM PARK TO REVERSE, THEIR WAS A DEFINITE SLIP, AND ALSO NOTICED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE LIGHT CAME ON THAT THEIR WAS A SHUDDER WHEN UPSHIFTING FROM 4TH TO 5TH GEAR. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY DETERMINED THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. DUE TO THE COST OF THIS BEING OVER $4000.00, I DECIDED TO BRING IT TO A REPUTABLE TRANSMISSION REPAIR FACILITY. I DID GET A LOWER QUOTE AND AUTHORIZED THE REPAIR. I SPOKE TO THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS AND HE ADVISED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REMANUFACTURED AND THEY ALSO FOUND WATER OR COOLANT IN THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.

THIS ISSUE IS EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE AND THE PASSENGERS AT HIGHER SPEEDS.

I REALLY DOUBT IF THE FORD DEALER (GAINESVILLE FORD IN GAINESVILLE, FL) CORRECTLY PERFORMED THE RECALL JOB IN 2005, AS THEY HAVE A REPUTATION OF LOW STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND TECHNIQUE . BUT, FORD, AS THE MANUFACTURER, SHOULD HAVE ALSO TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENFORCING THE RECALL JOB MEET THE STANDARD. OTHERWISE, WHAT IS POINT OF GOING THROUGH THE RECALL?   2. SINCE JULY OF 2008, I STARTED TO NOTICE THAT THE BACK LIFTGATE PANEL START HAVING CRACKING UNDER THE REAR WINDOW. I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS RELATED TO THE MALFUNCTION OF THE LIFTGATE GLASS STRUTS OR HINGES, THE SAME SYSTEM  THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY RECALLED. NONETHELESS, THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE AS WELL, SINCE THE CRACK APPEARING REFLECTS THE LIFTGATE BEING UNSTABLE AND THE GLASS HAVING MUCH HIGHER RISK OF ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING, THEREFORE COURSING INJURY.

FORD HAS RECOGNIZED THIS PROBLEM AND HAS UPGRADED THE MOTOROLA UNIT WITH THE END RESULT COSTING THE CONSUMER $500  FOR THE REPAIR. THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE BECAUSE THE VEHICLE RUNS IN 4X4 AUTO ADJUSTING THE DRIVETRAIN TO WEATHER CONDITIONS OPTIMIZING THE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.. THIS COMPONENT REPLACEMENT SHOULD BE QUALIFIED AS A RE-CALL BY FORD AND THE COST SHOULD NOT EFFECT THE CONSUMER.

WE DID HAVE THE POLICE COME OUT AND INSPECT THE VEHICLE FOR ANY INDICATIONS AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE GLASS TO SHATTER.  THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I GOT HOME WE DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  WE DID FIND THAT IN 2001 FORD RECALLED THOUSANDS OF FORD EXPLORERS FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE.  WE CONTACTED FORD AND WERE TOLD THAT OUR VEHICLE WAS NOT PART OF THAT RECALL.  THEY DIRECTED US TO NHTSA TO FILE A COMPLAINT DUE TO OUR ISSUE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THIS RECALL.  WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND THAT OUR VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL.  WE HAVE THE VEHICLE IN THE SHOP RIGHT NOW AND AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE THAT THE GLASS, HINGES, REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER MECHANISM, STRUTS AND ANY OTHER PARTS AFFECTED ARE BEING REPLACED.

THE BRAKES WOULD GRIND AND NOT STOP THE VEHICLE AND SOMETIMES PULSATION WOULD OCCUR AT ANY SPEED.  IT WAS LIKE THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM WAS COMING ON WHEN IT SHOULDN'T(SUMMER DRY ROADS) AND THEN GETTING STUCK IN THE BRAKE RELEASE STATE. SO WHEN TRYING TO STOP THE VEHICLE WITH THE FOOT PEDAL,  THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM WAS WORKING AGAINST YOUR BRAKING ACTION. THIS CAUSES A VERY SCARY FEELING WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FOOT TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE STILL REMAINS IN MOTION. THE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS WERE REPLACED, BUT NOT THE PROBLEM. THE NEXT INCIDENCE OCCURRED IN A BUSY INTERSECTION WHEN WE WERE ALMOST HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T STOP AT A RED LIGHT.  WHEN TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THE MECHANIC I ALMOST HIT 2 PEDESTRIANS IN A CROSSWALK AT A STOP SIGN. THE VEHICLE JUST KEPT ON GOING AND I QUICKLY BEEPED THE HORN FOR A NEAR MISS OF A MAN AND HIS LITTLE BOY. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM WHICH CAUSES THE BRAKES TO MALFUNCTION. HE SENT US TO ANOTHER MECHANIC AND HE SAID THIS IS A DEFECT IN CERTAIN FORD EXPLORER MODELS. THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SENSORS, ALONG WITH THE LOCATION OF THEM IS THE PROBLEM.  HE SAID TO FIX THIS IT WOULD COST ANYWHERE BETWEEN 300-600 DEPENDING ON WHAT ELSE WAS DAMAGED, BUT HE STRESSED DRIVING THE VEHICLE LIKE THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD. I WAS UPSET BECAUSE OF THE LOW MILES ON THIS VEHICLE. IT WAS ONLY OVER WARRANTY MILES BY 2000 BUT 5 YRS OLD. I COULD NOT AFFORD TO FIX THIS SO I WAS INSTRUCTED TO PULL THE FUSE ON THE ABS BECAUSE IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE WITH THE ABS. I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND THIS IS MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION. WITH THE ABS FUSE PULLED I DO NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM, BUT LACKING ABS. FORD NEEDS TO STAND BY THERE PRODUCT AND OFFER A RECALL ON THIS COMPLETELY UNSAFE MALFUNCTION OF THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM.  *TR",

THE ENTIRE CAM DRIVE (TIMING CHAIN, SPROCKETS, TENSIONERS) HAD BEEN GROUND UP. THE TENSIONER PADS HAD 3/8\" DEEP GROOVES WORN INTO THEM AND THERE WERE METAL SHAVINGS EVERYWHERE. THE BILL THIS TIME WAS ALMOST $1,300. IT IS INTERESTING THAT ALL THE PARTS THAT WERE REPLACED WERE A DIFFERENT DESIGN THAN THE ORIGINALS. IF THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN, WHY SPEND THE MONEY TO CHANGE THEM? OF COURSE FORD WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE TIMING CHAIN FOR THE CAMS.  AFTER THE TIMING CHAIN WAS FIXED THERE WAS STILL A NOISE SO WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE SHOP THAT DID THE WORK. WITH A STETHOSCOPE THE NOISE WAS ISOLATED TO THE BELLHOUSING/TORQUE CONVERTER AREA. WE TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP WE TRUST AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A CRACKED FLEX PLATE BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY ON THESE VEHICLES AND IT CAUSES THAT KIND OF NOISE. THE FLEX PLATE WAS FINE AS WAS THE FRONT PUMP ON THE TRANSMISSION AND THE STARTER DRIVE. THE ONLY THING LEFT IN THAT AREA WAS THE TORQUE CONVERTER SO WE REPLACED THAT. THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE. HE SAID THAT THE NOISE HAD TO BE COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT WOULD BE A $2,000 REPAIR.   I'VE HAD IT WITH FORD AND THEIR \"QUALITY IS JOB ONE\" OR WHATEVER THEIR CURRENT ADVERTISING LIE IS.

THE DEALERS SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT AT ONE TIME, THERE HAD BEEN FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REPAIR, BUT NOT ANYMORE.  I WAS TOLD BY FORD THAT SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY COULD NOT HELP ME. SO FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WILL DO NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM.    THIS HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT, BUT SINCE I TOOK CARE OF MY VEHICLE BY PARKING IT OUT OF THE ELEMENTS, IT DID NOT MANIFEST UNTIL THE CAR WAS OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD.

NEXT DAY, THE SOUND WAS PROGRESSIVELY WORSENING, I EVEN HEARD IT WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN A STRAIGHT PATH, BUT THE NOISE STILL WAS NOT CONSISTENT. IT DID SEEM LOUDER WITH A CLANKING SOUND IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. THAT DAY ON THE HIGHWAY COMING HOME FROM WORK THE NOISE WAS INTERMITTENT UNTIL I HAD SLOWED DOWN FOR TRAFFIC AND IT BEGAN TO VIBRATE AND SHAKE. FORTUNATELY, I WAS AT MY EXIT AND WAS TWO BLOCKS FROM HOME. I WAS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENED. THERE WAS A RUBBING SOUND NOW THAT WAS AT THE REAR RT SIDE OF THE CAR. LATER, THAT EVENING WE WERE TOLD IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEARING. FIRST MY HUSBAND WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE BEARING FROM A FORD DEALER. THEN HE CAME TO FIND OUT THAT THE ENTIRE KIT WAS NEEDED, AS WELL AS, A SPECIAL TOOL TO GET THE BOLT OFF WHICH TOOK HOURS TO LOOSEN AND RELEASE. TODAY HE IS STILL TRYING TO REPLACE THE RT REAR WHEEL BEARING WITH THE KIT FROM AN AUTO STORE SINCE FORD IS NOT OPEN AND THIS IS OUR ONE MEANS OF TRAVEL FOR THE FAMILY.

I TALKED TO FORD WHEN IT FIRST OCCURRED AND THEY SAID BASED ON MY MILEAGE THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT AND IT WOULD COST ABOUT 500. MY QUESTION TO FORD WAS WHAT DOES THE MILEAGE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A RECALL DEFECT THAT ULTIMATELY CAUSED THIS PROBLEM?

ONE BEARING ACTUALLY BROKE ON MY VEHICLE AND NOW I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO BE STRANDED SOMEWHERE. I HAVE A FRONT AND REAR BEARING OUT AGAIN.   *TR",

IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT  A PART THAT SHOULD LAST A MINIMUM OF 100,000 MI IS GOING TO COST ME IN EXCESS OF $700!  IS FORD SIMPLY USING LESS EXPENSIVE PARTS BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DO  NOT CARRY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AFTER 5 YEARS?  IN ADDITION TO FILING A COMPLAINT HERE, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY. THEY ARE A MUCH LOUDER VOICE SINCE THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY OUT UNNECESSARY CLAIMS. FORD DOES NOT WANT TO ALERT THE PUBLIC TO A SAFETY ISSUE PRIOR TO SOMEONE BEING KILLED, NOR DO THEY VOLUNTARILY WISH TO ASSUME THIS EXPENSE IF THE PUBLIC SIMPLY GOES OUT AND PAYS $700 TO FIX IT.  I'M SO FIRED UP, I MAY ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT TO THE MEDIA. FORD & TSA.

FORD SERVICE SAYS THAT I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION FOR $3K+ AND THAT IT CAN GO OUT ANY DAY NOW.  AFTER RESEARCH, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMMON ISSUE AND RELATED TO A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE AN EXPECTED COST OF AUTO OWNERSHIP.  HAVE NOT DECIDED WHO TO HAVE REPAIR IT YET.  *TR",

I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE ISSUE AFTER APPARENTLY BLOWING THE ENTIRE ENGINE ON MY 2006 FORD EXPLORER.

THE FIRST TIME THIS OCCURRED WAS A YEAR AGO.  AT THAT TIME, WE TOOK THE CAR TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AND WERE TOLD THE SAFETY HARNESS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THIS WAS COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THE AIRBAG LIGHT HAS RECENTLY COME ON AGAIN.  AGAIN, WE TOOK THE CAR TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AND THIS TIME ARE TOLD THAT ANOTHER HARNESS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND A WIRE UNDER THE SEAT IS NOT WORKING AND THE REPAIRS (WHICH ARE NOT UNDER WARRANTY) WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $370.  I COMPLAINED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT I FEEL I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS AS THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND THEIR PREVIOUS REPAIR SHOULD HOLD SOME GUARANTEE.  I WAS TOLD THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS.  I FIND THIS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE AS A NON-FUNCTIONING AIRBAG IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  I AM NOTIFYING THE NHTSA AND THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION OF THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO BE A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH MY 2002 FORD EXPLORER. *JB",

THERE WAS A SMELL THIS LAST TIME OF BURNING ELECTRICAL WIRE AND SMOKE. NOW MY EXPLORER WON'T DRIVE AND HAS A ELECTRICAL SMOKE SMELL STUCK IN IT.

HE ALSO TOLD ME ABOUT A LEAK ON HIS GARAGE FLOOR IN THE REAR MIDDLE OF THE CAR WHERE THE REAR AXLE IS. I TOLD HIM I HAVE SAME EXACT SPOT OF SOMETHING LEAKING ON MY GARAGE FLOOR. WE READ ABOUT ALL THE SEAL PROBLEMS WITH THE AXLE AND NEEDING TO BE REPLACED. HE SPENT OVER $1000 ON THE FRONT BEARINGS AND NOW IN FOR ANOTHER BIG BILL FOR THE SEAL PROBLEM. I SEE WE ARE NOT ALONE IN OUR EXPLORER DISAPPOINTMENTS. ALL WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. COME ON FORD, BACK UP YOUR VEHICLE AND PAY FOR THESE DEFECTS TO YOUR SUVS.  *JB",

UPON WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO THE DEALER AND FORD WE SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE INSPECTED AND TEST DRIVEN AGAIN DUE TO MORE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED THEN THE SHIFT LEVER LOCKED UP BETWEEN PARK AND REVERSE AND HAD TO BE SERVICED WITHIN HOURS OF PICKUP. THEN A COOLANT GASKET WAS DISCOVERED TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND A ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR DAMAGED AND GLUED TOGETHER AND TIE WRAPPED TO THE TRANS.  THE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED IN WRITING OF THE DISCOVERIES. THERE WAS NO RESPONSE. THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED INDEPENDENTLY. A SHOP DIAGNOSED A POOR SHIFT, SHORT SHIFT, LONG SHIFT, AND CLUNKING WITH VIBRATION CONDITION IN THE TRANSMISSION. THE DEALER WAS CALLED TWICE WITH NO RESPONSE. ON DECEMBER 20, 2006 THE TRANS FAILED FOR THE THIRD TIME AT 57,231 MILES. THE AFTER MARKET WARRANTY WAS NOTIFIED AND DIRECTED US TO THE FORD SERVICE WARRANTY. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP DUE TO A CERTIFIED LETTER THAT WAS RECEIVED BY THE FIRST STATING THAT OUR TRANS PROBLEMS WERE \"PERCEIVED\" AND THAT THEY WERE ENDING OUR \"BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.\" THE NEXT DEALERSHIP PERFORMED THE EEC CODE CHECK. A TSB HAD BEEN ISSUED,CODES 733 AND 745. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US THAT WE MUST GUARANTEE THEIR FEE TO TEAR DOWN THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE REPAIR MAY NOT BE COVERED. THEY ALSO STATED THAT WE HAD \"NO WARRANTY\" ON THE VEHICLE. THE SERVICE MANAGER AFTER SOME DISCUSSION STATED \"WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN YOUR TRUCK REPAIR AT ALL.\" WE IMMEDIATELY HAD OUR VEHICLE REMOVED FROM THEIR DEALERSHIP. ANOTHER SHOP STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS IN FACT FAILED AGAIN. WE ARE WAITING FOR A POSSIBLE COVERAGE DETERMINATION FROM THE AFTER MARKET COMPANY. FORD WAS NOTIFIED.*JB",

CALLED CROSSROADS FORD AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR MIKE BEVAN (SERVICE ADVISOR) HE FAILED TO RETURN MY CALLS. MY HUSBAND CALLED MIKE BEVAN AND WAS ABLE TO SPEAK WITH HIM, MIKE INFORMED MY HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND IF WE WOULD BRING THE VEHICLE TO HIM THEY WOULD LET US KNOW THE COST TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE LARGE NUMBER OF OWNERS LISTED ON CARREVIEW.COM WITH THE SAME SITUATION. IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY ANOTHER VEHICLE COULD HAVE REAR ENDED MY VEHICLE CAUSING DAMAGE AND INJURY.  *NM",

I DOUBLE CHECKED THE RECOMMENDED SERVICE SCHEDULE TO SEE IF I HAD MISSED SOMETHING BUT THEY DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT THE REAR AXLE FLUID BE CHANGED UNTIL 150K MILES.  SO THIS IS NOT A CASE OF OWNER NEGLECT.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION AT THE DEALER SERVICE CENTER THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS REPAIR IS FAIRLY COMMON ON EXPLORERS, MOUNTAINEERS AND AVIATORS AND THAT THE REPAIR KIT HAS A NEWLY DESIGNED SEAL.  IF THERE IS A NEWLY DESIGNED SEAL AVAILABLE, THIS STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE ORIGINAL SEALS ARE INSUFFICIENT.  THIS IS ALSO PROVEN BY THE FACT THAT BOTH SEALS FAILED, NOT JUST ONE.  THE COST OF THE REPAIR WAS QUOTED AT $490 ($380 OF WHICH WAS LABOR COST).  THIS IS TOO MUCH TO ASK A CONSUMER TO PAY FOR A PART THAT WAS UNDER DESIGNED AND NOT PROPERLY TESTED PRIOR TO BEING PUT INTO PRODUCTION.

WHEN I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE AT THE FORD PLACE, THE PERSON OF WHOM REMAINS ANONYMOUS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, SAID TO ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ABOUT 10-100 OTHER VEHICLES COME IN TO THEIR PLACE ALONE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE AND NO ONE WOULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  PLEASE CONTACT ME.  *NM",

I NOTICED AT THE SAME TIME THAT MY EXPLORER WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY SHIFTING GEARS. WHEN TRAFFIC WOULD COME TO A STOP, IT WOULD SHIFT INTO 3RD, THEN 1ST, THEN 4TH AND BACK TO 2ND. NEVER BEFORE HAD I EXPERIENCED SUCH A BIZARRE ACT WITH ANY PREVIOUS VEHICLE. MY EXPLORER WAS IN THE SHOP FOR THE NEXT 45 DAYS AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT NOT EVEN A LOCAL AUTHORIZED FORD DEALERSHIP COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. FINALLY THE PRIVATE SHOP THAT I TOOK IT TO FIXED IT AFTER REBUILDING THE TRANSMISSION 2 TIMES. VERY DISAPPOINTING, SINCE IN THE PAST I HAVE DRIVEN SEVERAL VEHICLES PAST 200K MILES AND OIL CHANGES AND TIRES WERE REQUIRED. ONCE I RECEIVED THE VEHICLE BACK AFTER 2 TRANSMISSION REBUILDS, NEW TORQUE CONVERTER AND NEW EGR VALUE, THE EXPLORER CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AFTER ONLY 1 DAY OR NORMAL DRIVING. RIDICULOUS. COME TO FIND OUT AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH TO SEE IF FORD HAD ANY RECALLS ON THE TRANSMISSION, I DISCOVER THAT NOT ONLY DOES FORD NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND HAVE YET TO ISSUE A RECALL. I CAME ACROSS SEVERAL WEBSITES THAT HAD 100'S OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VERY SAME THING GOING ON WITH MY VEHICLE.

NOW AFTER $3K IN TOTAL REPAIRS, WE ARE FACED WITH THE DECISION TO TRY AND TRADE THE VEHICLE AND EAT OUR LOSSES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER FORD BUILT VEHICLE.

I AM NOT SURE WHAT CAUSES THE PROBLEMS THAT I AM EXPERIENCING, I JUST KNOW THAT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALSO HAVING THESE PROBLEMS.  FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS A LEAK IN MY REAR DIFFERENTIAL.  MY TRUCK IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP FOR THAT NOW - HOWEVER, THE SHOP MGR REFUSES TO FIX THE LEAK UNTIL THE REAR END BREAKS....  WHICH WILL COST MORE AND CAUSE MORE REPAIRS THAN NECESSARY AT THE CURRENT TIME.  MY SECOND PROBLEM - WHICH THE SERVICE MGR AGAIN REFUSES TO FIX UNTIL IT BREAKS IS WITH THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER - WHICH LEADS TO TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WHICH ARE ALSO VERY COSTLY.  I HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK ON THIS SITUATION, SINCE I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO, AND I AM SEEING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, REPLACED THE REAR END ON MY 2002 EXPLORER (MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE SAME VEHICLE), AND I AM SEEING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NEW TRANSMISSION ON MY 2002 EXPLORER (AGAIN, MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE SAME VEHICLE).  I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS SITE, OR I'M SURE THAT HUNDREDS OF THE SAME KIND OF COMPLAINTS WOULD BE FILED WITH YOU....  SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK IN TO THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE FORD IS AWFUL PROUD OF THEIR VEHICLES AND I AM PAYING A HEFTY CHUNK OF MONEY FOR MINE, AS ARE THE TONS OF OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS WHO JUST MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING SOMETHING DONE REGARDING THIS PROBLEM...  I'M SPEAKING NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF, BUT, FOR LOADS OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM, I BEG YOU!!  I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH MY BABIES (4 & 5 YRS OLD) PRAYING THAT THE RIGHT PERSON STOPS TO HELP ME AND NOT THE ONE WITH BAD INTENTIONS!!

TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE CONTACT OBSERVED A LOW GRADE DEEP DRUM NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND THE DEALER NOTIFIED THE CONTACT THAT BOTH REAR BEARINGS WERE WEARING OUT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.   AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED AND DETERMINED THAT BOTH BEARINGS WERE SHOT AND THE REAR DRIVER SPRING WAS BROKEN.

OF COURSE I AM OUT OF THE WARRANTY NOW AND I KNOW THAT THE TRANNY ON THIS MODEL FORD IS \"SEALED\" MEANING I CANNOT CHECK TRANNY FLUIDS AND ONLY THE DEALER CAN SERVICE THE TRANSMISSION. I HEAR MANY HORROR STORIES OF THE TRANNY GOING OUT PREMATURELY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN FROM FORD ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

SECOND INSTANCE HAD VIBRATION WHEN ENGAGING THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE AND LOUD WHINING NOISE/ VIBRATION FROM REAR; THEN FLUID LEAKAGE.  MY DEALER ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT MANY EXPLORERS (2002-2005) HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY ENGINEERS ARE EVALUATING; AS A DEALER THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. FORD HAS NOT INDICATED A FIX OTHER THAN TO CHECK FLUID LEVEL, REPLACE REAR AXLE SEALS, AND/OR THE REAR UNIT.

ON 2/26/06 AFTER A 30 MINUTE DRIVE ON THE INTERSTATE AND THEN DOING AN IN-TOWN ERRAND, THE OVERDRIVE OFF LIGHT STARTED FLASHING.  AFTER PARKING IT IN OUR GARAGE THERE WAS A BURNED FLUID SMELL.  DUE FOR THE 30K TRANSMISSION SERVICE, I ALSO ASKED FOR A COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC TEST AT AN INDEPENDENT TRANS. SPECIALIST.  THE MECHANIC CAME TO ME WITH THE PAN ASKING DO YOU POSSIBLY HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  (NO!  I SHOULDN'T NEED ONE FOR A MAJOR COMPONENT SUCH AS A TRANSMISSION.)  THE FLUID WAS COMPLETELY BLACK WITH NO HINT OF RED.  ADDITIONALLY THE MAGNET WAS COVERED WITH A 1/2\" THICK LAYER OF METAL SHAVINGS!  THE COMPUTER CODE (P1783) REVEALED THAT THE FLUID HAD HEATED TO GREATER THAN 270 DEGREES F.  THE TRANSMISSION IS FRIED AND HIS BEST ESTIMATE TO REBUILD IT WAS AROUND $3,000!  LET ME STATE THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS NEVER DRIVEN UNDER ANY HARSH CONDITIONS, EVEN THOSE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ACCORDING TO FORD ADVERTISEMENTS SUCH AS TOWING, OFF-ROAD OR USING THE 4 X 2 LOW GEAR.  AFTER DOING AN INTERNET SEARCH AND READING HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPEATED FAILURES WITH THE REBUILT AND/OR NEW 5R55W'S INSTALLED, WHAT IS THE CONSUMER SUPPOSED TO DO?  WE HAVE TO PAY FOR FORD'S MANUFACTURING DEFECT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR POOR ENGINEERING ON THEIR VEHICLES.  AS MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED, THIS VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN PAID FOR SO THIS IS A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR OUR FAMILY.  I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE EXACTLY, BUT IT SURE IS HURTING THE POCKETBOOK OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NO PROTECTION FROM CONSUMER LAWS ONCE IT'S PAST THE 1 YR FOR LEMON LAW OR THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  HOW DO WE GET SUPPORT AS A GROUP TO GET A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT STARTED? NOT BUILT FORD TOUGH!",

I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE DEALER.  THE BRAKES TWICE MORE THE WAY OVER FELT STRANGE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST TIME.

THREE TIMES ON THE WAY TO THE DEALER THE CAR WOULD ON IT'S OWN GO SLIGHTLY FASTER WITHOUT ME DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL FURTHER.

I HAD THE VEHICLE BACK FOR 2 WEEKS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED ON THE RIGHT HEAD. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN AND THE DEALER SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE FAULT. THEIR REASON IS THAT THERE WERE AUTOLITE SPARK PLUGS IN THE VEHICLE INSTEAD OF MOTORCRAFT SPARK PLUGS. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID THE PREVIOUS REPAIR WITHOUT REALIZING THAT. FURTHERMORE, THEY ONLY REPLACED THE ONE PLUG ORIGINALLY THAT BLEW OUT, RE-USING THE OTHER 3 PLUGS (AUTOLITES) THAT WERE IN THE VEHICLE. I HAVE TALKED WITH FORD IN MICHIGAN AND THEY ARE LOOKING INTO IT. FIRST, THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT HONORING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE OF SPARK PLUG BRAND IS SOMETHING I CANNOT FIND WRITTEN ANYWHERE. SECOND, IF THOSE PLUGS ARE SO BAD, THEN ARE THEY NEGLIGENT IN PUTTING THOSE PLUGS BACK IN. THIRD, THE FACT THAT THIS HAPPENED AND COULD HAVE PIERCED A FUEL LINE IS VERY HAZARDOUS. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR HALF DAY TRIP IN A DESOLATE AREA. SHOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAVE HAPPENED WHILE SHE WAS OUT THERE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE.

PURCHASED VEHICLE NEW ON MARCH 29, 2002. AUGUST 14, 2003, APPROXIMATELY 10,250 MILES, HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR ROTORS DUE TO RUSTING. FORD DEALERSHIP RECOMMENDED THE BRAKE LININGS BE REPLACED AS WELL. FORD COVERED THIS COMPLETE COST. IN THIS 2ND INSTANCE, FORD WILL COVER NOTHING SINCE VEHICLE IS BEYOND ITS 36 MONTH WARRANTY, & BRAKES ARE CONSIDERED WEAR ITEMS. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AS THE RUSTING OF THE REAR ROTORS PREVENTED MY VEHICLE FROM PASSING THE STATE SAFETY INSPECTION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS IS MY 3RD EXPLORER, ALL PURCHASED NEW, & THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS PROBLEM. INITIAL 1991 EXPLORER DRIVEN 9 YEARS & OVER 70,000 MILES; 2ND EXPLORER A 2000 MODEL STILL DRIVING, OVER 54,000 MILES, HAD THE REAR ROTORS & BRAKE PADS REPLACED AFTER 44 MONTHS, 33,692 MILES. HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME AREA & DRIVEN THE SAME ROADS WITH ALL 3 VEHICLES. HAVE HAD ESSENTIALLY ALL SERVICE WORK DONE BY THE SELLING FORD DEALER IN ALL 3 INSTANCES. IF THE BRAKE PADS WERE WEARING OUT, & THE ROTORS WERE BEING DAMAGED DUE TO THE WORN PADS, I COULD UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CONDITION WAS DUE TO MY NEGLIGENCE IN NOT ATTENDING TO THE BRAKING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE BRAKE PADS HAVE NOT BEEN WORN OUT IN EITHER REPLACEMENT SITUATION. THE SERVICE ADVISER & SERVICE MANAGER BOTH CLAIM THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO, AS THE ROTORS CANNOT BE TURNED, RUST IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH BRAKE ROTORS, AND FORD REGARDS BRAKE ROTORS AS WEAR COMPONENTS. CORRESPONDENCE THRU FORD'S INTERNET SITE REPEATED ROTORS ARE CONSIDERED A WEAR ITEM & CANNOT BE COVERED, REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR REPLACEMENT. NO ONE WILL PROVIDE ANY FORD REGIONAL CONTACT INFORMATION FOR DISCUSSION. IT APPEARS TO BE A NO WIN SITUATION WHERE THE MANUFACTURER CAN CLASSIFY A COMPONENT AS A WEAR ITEM & HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES WHEN THE COMPONENT FAILS FOR OTHER NON-WEAR REASONS.   *NM",

APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK AFTER PURCHASE, NOTICED DELAY IN GEARS ENGAGING WHEN GOING FROM PARK TO DRIVE , PARK TO REVERSE ALSO GEAR SHIFT SEEMED TO BE LOOSE. RETURNED TO DEALER; TOLD IT WAS NORMAL FOR THIS MODEL.  ADVISED TO KEEP IN OVERDRIVE.  LATE JULY 2004, NOTICED DELAY SEEM TO BE GETTING LONGER AND JERKING SUDDENLY WHEN FINALLY ENGAGED.  WHILE DRIVING ,OD LIGHT FLASHED ON AND OFF ERRATICALLY. PROBLEM WITH OD LIGHT  INTERMITTENT.  SPOUSE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER; TOLD THAT IT WASN'T UNDER WARRANTY, BUT WE COULD MAKE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  SPOUSE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A SHOP HAD DONE BUSINESS  IN THE PAST.  THOUGHT THAT IT COULD NEED TRANSMISSION FLUID.  CHECKED FLUID LEVELS NOT DEFICIENT.  PROBLEMS CONTINUED; HAD THEM LOOK AT IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER.  COULD NOT DETERMINE PROBLEM, ADVISED TO TAKE TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST IF CONTINUED.  PROBLEM PERSISTED.  SEEMED TO GET WORSE AS THE WEATHER TURNED COLDER.  LATE DECEMBER 04, DELAYS IN ENGAGING GEARS WORSENED; NOW MAKING A LOUD CLUNKING NOISE AND LUNGES WHEN ENGAGES, OD LIGHT FLASHED ERRATICALLY ON A FREQUENT BASIS AND ENGINE SERVICE LIGHT ON AND GEAR SHIFT SEEMED TO BE COMING OUT.  JANUARY 2005, SPOUSE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP FOR DIAGNOSTIC.  TRANSMISSION SHOT.  REBUILT AT A COST OF $2900.  FOUND OUT THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN REPAIRED TWICE BEFORE, WHILE UNDER WARRANTY FOR THE SAME PROBLEMS DESCRIBED.  ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT THIS IS A KNOWN DESIGN DEFECT.  WHEN A COMPANY SELLS DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THEY SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DO SO KNOWINGLY.

I AM FILING THIS TO REQUEST:    (I) FORD TO REQUIRE DEALERSHIPS TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS PERSONALLY IN WRITING OF RECALLS...IF NHTSA OR THE MANUFACTURER DEEMS AN ISSUE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO ISSUE A RECALL NOTICE, SHOULDN'T THE DEALER BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO THE CONSUMER?  IT IS AN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE TO DO LESS THAN THIS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CONSUMER HAS FAILED TO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF HIS OR HER PURCHASE AND MAY BE RISKING OF DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS; AND   II.

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE SINCE REAR TRANSAXLE FLUID LEAKS DOWN DRIVE SHAFT TO BRAKE ASSEMBLY.  I ONLY NOTICE BECAUSE I PERFORM A MONTHLY INSPECTION OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE.

THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE FORD EXPLORER.  SEVERAL WORK COLLEAGUES HAD THE REAR AXLE SIEZE DUE TO LUBRICANT LOSS WITH SIMILIAR SYMPTOMS, ALMOST CAUSING SERIOUS ACCIDENT. MY DEALER ACKNOWLEDGES (BILL ESTES, BROWNSBURG, IN) THAT MANY EXPLORERS (2002-2005) HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY ENGINEERS ARE EVALUATING;  AS A DEALER THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  FORD HAS NOT INDICATED A FIX OTHER THAN TO CHECK FLUID LEVEL, REPLACE REAR AXLE SEALS, AND/OR THE REAR UNIT.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD SINCE IN MOST CASES THE VEHICLE OWNER WILL NOT KNOW THERE IS A PENDING FAILURE DUE TO THE FLUID LEAKING DOWN THE REAR AXLE DRIVE SHAFT TOWARD THE BRAKE/WHEEL ASSEMBLY.  THE WHINING NOISE WILL INCREASE AS FLUID LEVEL DECREASES WITH RISK FAILURE AND LOSS OF CONTROL.  THIS PROBLEM IS FAR MORE COMMON THAN REPORTED DUE TO THE DIFFICULT NATURE OF OBSERVATION OF LEAKAGE.  ONE HAS TO CRAWL UNDER THE REAR TRANSAXLE AND CAREFULLY INSPECT THE TWO AXLE SEALS TO LOOK FOR SIGNS OF CORROSION AND FLUID LEAKAGE.",

(EVEN BEFORE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY REQUESTED US TOO). A WEEK LATER MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO TEXAS AND THE SOUND GOT WORSE. UPON RETURNING FROM OUR TRIP I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS MY AXEL. MY FAMILY AND I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR MISTAKE. I 'VE HAD MY FRONT AND REAR WHEEL BEARINGS, AXEL, AXEL BOOT, HUBS BEARINGS, EMERGENCY BRAKE (WHICH THEY SAY WAS SPLIT) REPLACED.

WE PULLED OVER, AND SAW THAT THEY WERE SMOKING AND SMELLED BADLY.  CALLED FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANT TO TOW US TO LANDMARK FORD, IN TIGARD, OREGON. UPON INSPECTION ON 09/20/04, PARTS WERE REPLACED. TWO WEEKS LATER ON OCTOBER 3,2004, WE WERE AGAIN DRIVING AND WHEN WE GOT HOME, AND  NOTICED THAT THE REAR LEFT BRAKES WERE SMOKING AND SMELLED BADLY. WE CALLED FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ,AND HAD THE CAR TOWED AGAIN TO LANDMARK FORD. UPON INSPECTION ON 10/4/04 WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT REPLACE ANY PARTS. WE SPOKE WITH SERVICE MANAGER LARRY BAKER CONCERNING THIS ISSUE. HE ASKED US TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME, AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO CALL AND BRING THE CAR DOWN. ON FRIDAY APRIL 15,2005 WE WERE DRIVING WITH OUR TWO NIECES WHEN WE NOTICED THE LEFT REAR BRAKES STARTED SMOKING AND SMELLING BADLY. WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO HOME AND  MADE IT. THE ENTIRE WHEEL ON THE LEFT SIDE WAS TOO HOT TO TOUCH, THE RUBBER ON THE TIRE WAS ALSO VERY HOT.  WE CALLED FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AGAIN TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED DOWN TO LANDMARK FORD. WE RECEIVED A CALL ON TUESDAY 04/19,2005 FROM SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  WE WERE ASKED AGAIN TO PICK UP THE CAR, AND CALL IF ANY PROBLEMS AROSE.  THREE TIMES  THE SAME EXACT THING HAS HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING. SMOKING AND SMELLING BRAKES IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD, AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ONE TIME IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN THE CAR COULD CATCH ON FIRE. IT APPEARS TO BE AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM, AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MANAGER  MIKE WALKER STATED PREVIOUSLY THAT THEY HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS BEFORE, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT OUT A RECALL.

HE STATED THAT FORD IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF EXTENDED WARRANTIES, THEY WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. I DID NOT PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE WHO WOULD EXPECT THAT A TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE REBUILT AT 39000 MILES (INCIDENTALLY 3000 MILES PAST MY WARRANTY COVERAGE). LUCKILY NO ONE WAS INJURED BECAUSE I PARKED THE TRUCK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. BUT NOW I AM FACED WITH THE COST OF REBUILDING THIRD GEAR INTO MY TRUCK, WITH NO ONE ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILTY FOR THE DEFECT.*AK",

IT IS A 2002 FORD EXPLORER EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC 4-WHEEL DRIVE AS WELL AS FULL 4-WHEEL DRIVE WITH HIGH & LOW TRANSFER CASE, 5-SPEED AUTOMATIC, 4.6L V8 WITH DOUBLE OVERHEAD CAMS, LIMITED SLIP REAR DIFFERENTIAL, TOWING PACKAGE, LEATHER SEATS, ETC. HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM HAS THE POTENTIAL OF CAUSING HARM OR EVEN DEATH TO ITS PASSENGERS AND/OR THOSE IN OTHER CARS AND ESPECIALLY PEDESTRIANS.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN EXTREMELY INTERMITTENT SUCH THAT THE TECHNICIANS CANNOT EXPERIENCE IT THEMSELVES.  IT USUALLY HAPPENS ON A COLD DAY.  THE FIRST TIME IT DID IT, I WAS PULLING A SMALL TRAILER AND I HAD DRIVEN A COUPLE OF MILES TO A PLANT NURSERY AND ON THE WAY BACK AS I NEARED MY HOUSE, I DROVE DOWN A LONG GRADE TOWARD A STOP SIGN.  WHEN I BEGAN TO APPLY THE BRAKES, THE ENGINE ACCELERATED WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THE TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTED SO THAT I HAD TO STAND ON THE BRAKES WITH BOTH FEET TO KEEP FROM RUNNING CLEAN ACROSS THE ROAD INTO A TREE.  IT HAPPENED 2 MORE TIMES THAT DAY.  I THEN HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE IDLE VALVE.  HOWEVER, THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SENSE.  IT HAS HAPPENED WHILE TRAVELING UP A HILL, DOWN A HILL, AND ON LEVEL GROUND. BUT IT ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN YOU APPLY THE BRAKES.  THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED, IT THREW ME OUT INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS NOT HIT.  THE TIME BEFORE THAT IT TRIED TO RUN OVER THE LITTLE CAR IN FRONT OF ME BUT I WAS STILL ABLE TO STOP IT.  I'M THINKING ABOUT NAMING THIS SUV CHRISTINE.  MY BROTHER HAS AN EARLY 2002 EXPLORER EQUIPPED THE SAME AS MINE AND HIS HAS DONE IT ONCE.  MY MOTHER HAS A 1998 CROWN VICTORIA WITH THIS SAME ENGINE AND IT HAS DONE IT TWICE.  THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY \"CHRISTINES\" OUT THERE WAITING TO KILL AND THERE POOR OWNERS MAY NOT BE TOTALLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. *JB",

I OPTED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER SHOP THAT SPECIALIZES IN TRANSMISSION REPAIRS. I PAID THEM $2000 TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION YET AGAIN. APPARENTLY, ON THIS MODEL YEAR THE CASINGS ARE DEFECTIVE. THE TRANSMISSION SHOP TOLD ME THAT HE HAS ALREADY SEEN 4 OF THESE EXPLORERS ALL WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL DONE ON THE 2002 EXPLORERS ALONG WITH THE 2004. *AK",

THE DAMAGE HE \"SAW\" WAS 2 SUPERFICIAL SCRAPES ON THE PAINT, THERE WAS NOT ANY DENTS, CREASES OR BOWING OF ANY KIND TO THE PANEL. EVEN THOUGH I HAD DONE MY RESEARCH ON THIS SITE AND KNEW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE STRUTS, I COULD TELL THAT THIS MAN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME AND I WOULD NOT GET IT REPAIRED THERE. I HAVE SINCE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO RACEWAY FORD AND AM WAITING FOR THE ADVISOR TO CALL ME BACK. AT RACEWAY THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS A RECALL AND SEEM WILLING TO HELP ME. *AK",

THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF ITEMS THAT I'VE HAD REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY:    1.) FRONT BRAKES: A LOUD RUBBING/GRIDING SOUND BECAME INCREASINGLY LOUDER.  THE FIRST TIME THE SERVICE DEPT. FOLKS SAID THAT IT WAS NORMAL.  THE NEXT TIME I BROUGHT THE CAR IN, THEY COULD DENY THE NOISE AND THEY SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACE ONE ROTOR AND RESURFACED THE OTHER.  2.) REAR AXLE:  A BROKEN SEAL ALLOWED HYDROULIC FLUID TO COVER INSIDE OF THE REAR WHEEL CAUSING DIFFICULTY IN BRAKING.  THE SERVICE DEPT. REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY  3.) THE TRANSFER CASE FOR THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE WAS LEAKING FLUID.  THE SERVICE DEPT. REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY.  4.) THE VEHICLE STALLS A NUMEROUS AMOUNTS OF TIMES (10-15 TIMES) SINCE I'VE OWNED IT.  IT STALLS WHILE I'M DRIVING AT 35 MILES PER HOUR, IN REVERSE, DAY OR NIGHT.  WHEN I GO FOR AN ERRAND AND PARK, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT START.  AN HOUR LATER, WHEN THE TOW TRUCK IS THERE, THE VEHICLE START.  IT DRIVES ME CRAZY!!  THE SERVICE DEPT. SAYS THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE NOTHING REGISTERS ON THE COMPUTER AND THEY CANNOT SIMULATE THE PROBLEM.  THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED (08-04-04) MERGING ON TO THE FREEWAY IT STALLED.  UPON START-UP, BLACK SMOKE POURED OUT OF THE EXHAUST AND IDLING WAS EXTREMELY ROUGH. I HAD IT TOWED TO A FORD DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE DEPT REPLACED A MASS AIRFLOW METER UNDER WARRENTY.  THE VEHICLE RUNS...I'LL CROSS MY FINGERS!!    MY CURRENT PROBLEM IS THAT THE FRONT TIRES ARE SEVERLY CUPPING AND THE FRONT END VIBERATES AT 60 MPH AND OVER.  THE VEHICLE HAS 25K MILES AND THE TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED 5 TIMES ABOUT EVERY 5K MILES.  I HAD THE WHEELS CHECKED FOR ALIGNMENT AND BALANCE AND IT IS TO SPECIFICATIONS.  THE SERVICE DEPT SAYS ITS NORMAL AND TO CONTINUE WITH THE ROTATIONS.  THE TIRES ARE WEARING UNEVENLY AND PREMATURELY.  THE TIRE SHOP RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHOCKS AND STRUTS BE REPLACED.

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE ENGINE IS COLD OR WARM, THE WEATHER CONDTIONS HOT-DRY OR HUMID AND WET, IT STILL TICKS INTERMITENTLY FOR SOMETIMES AROUND 8 MINUTES OR CAN GO ON FOR 20 AT THAT MOMENT.  WHEN IT STARTS IT SOUNDS LIKE A TOGGLE SWITCH GOING ON AND OFF AND THEN MAKES A RUBBING ,SQUEAKING , TICKING NOISE THAT STARTS OFF LOW AND THEN GETS SO LOUD THAT YOU CAN HEAR IT WITH THE RADIO ON SET AT A SLIGHTLY HIGH VOLUME.

THE OWNERS MANUAL  STATED THAT IF THE LIGHT DID NOT GO OUT AFTER 3 CONSECUTIVE COLD STARTS TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER. THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE WINDOW FOR SERVICING AT ITS 15,000 MILE CHECK-UP ANYWAY, SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND SHOWED THEM THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT.  I EXPECTED THE VEHICLE WOULD BE FINISHED WITH ITS REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT PROBLEM FIXED IN A DAY OR TWO.  I WAS WRONG, AND FROM READING SIMILAR PROBLEMS REPORTED BY OTHER OWNERS, IT APPEARS THIS COULD BE A TREND FOR THE SPORT TRAC MODEL- IF NOT FOR THE ENTIRE EXPLORER GENRE. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE FUEL PUMP WAS LEAKING AND IT WAS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.  THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OFTEN NOTICED DROPS OF FLUID ON THE DRIVEWAY EACH TIME I BACKED OUT.  AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS CONDENSATION FROM THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM.  I DIDN'T CARE WHAT IT TOOK TO FIX IT BECAUSE IT WAS COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  THE DEALER HAD TO ORDER A WHOLE NEW GAS TANK, BECAUSE AS IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME, THE FUEL PUMP WAS INTEGRAL TO THE FUEL TANK.  THE FUEL TANK AND PUMP ASSEMBLY WAS NOT IN STOCK AND HAD TO BE ORDERED FROM THE FACTORY.  THE DEALER SUPPLIED A RENTAL CAR WHILE THE SPORT TRAC WAS BEING REPAIRED. IT TOOK 2 WEEKS FOR THE DEALER TO RECEIVE THE FUEL TANK AND PUMP.  AFTER THEY RECEIVED IT, IT ONLY TOOK TOOK A COUPLE OF HOURS FOR THE TECHNICIAN TO INSTALL IT AND CHECK IT OUT.  THE VEHICLE WAS PROPERLY REPAIRED AND I NO LONGER SEE ANY DROPLETS ON THE DRIVEWAY, NOR IS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED.  MOST OF THE TWO WEEKS THE VEHICLE WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP WAS DUE TO AWAITING PARTS. ANY FUEL LEAK SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CRITICAL FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THIS IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INFERIOR BONDING PRODUCT USED ON THIS WINDOW. THE INTERIM REMEDY WAS THAT I TAPED THE WINDOW UP WITH DUCT TAPE TO PROTECT THE VEHICLE FROM THE ELEMENTS & THEFT.)  IT'S CLEAR THAT SINCE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN 2 SECTIONS OF MY NEW VEHICLE THAT THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE BONDING PRODUCT USED ON THESE WINDOWS. I FOUND THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM ON MY VEHICLE.  (RECALL NO. 01I010000.) THERE IS ALSO A PHONE NO. TO CALL REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AS \u001cFORD HAS DECIDED TO CONDUCT A SPECIAL SERVICE CAMPAIGN TO INSPECT AND TORQUE THE LIFTGATE GLASS BRACKET ON AFFECTED VEHICLES.\u001d I CALLED THIS NUMBER AND WAS ADVISED THAT, ALTHOUGH I HAVE THE EXACT VEHICLE AND PROBLEM AS THE RECALL REQUIRES, MY VIN NUMBER DOES NOT RENDER ME ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL.

THE BODY SHOP (SHOWCASE)  ALSO BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THE CRACKING AND BUBBLING OF THE PAINT.  THEY ALSO CONTACTED CROUSE, AND AGAIN CROUSE NEVER RESPONDED.  SHOWCASE (THE BODY SHOP) HAD TO CALL A FEW TIMES BEFORE THEY RECEIVED A RESPONSE, AND NOTHING WAS RESOLVED.  I THINK THAT CROUSE SHOULD COVER THIS EXPENSE BEING THAT THE TRUCK IS ONLY A 2002.

WHEN MY FOOT WAS REMOVED FROM THE PEDAL, IT WOULD NOT RETURN FULLY TO IDLE BECAUSE THIS TAN MATERIAL BUNCHED UP AT THE BASE OF THE HOUSING WHERE THE CABLE COMES THROUGH THE FIREWALL.  BY CUTTING THE EXCESS MATERIAL AWAY, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE PEDAL TO RESPOND PROPERLY.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE THROTTLE CABLE UNDER WARRANTY.",

WE THEN TOOK THE TRUCK A WEEK LATER TO MARTIN BUICK TO FIX THE BODY DAMAGE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRUCK. THEY TOOK THE TRUCK TO LASKO FORD ACROSS THE STREET TO WORK ON THE 4X4 SYSTEM. THEY TOOK THE CLUTCHES OUT AND DRAINED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. THEY FOUND DAMAGE TO THE CLUTCHES. THESE PARTS WERE BLACKENED AND GLAZED OVER. THEY SAID THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WEAR AND TEAR FOR THIS TRUCK AND THAT THE TRUCK WAS NOT MAINTAINED. WE REGULARLY CHANGED FLUIDS AND THE MANUAL STATES THAT THE TRUCK DOES NOT NEED MAINTENANCE UNTIL 150,000 MILES. I ASKED HOW COULD A NEW TRUCK HAVE SO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE 4X4 AND THEY SAID THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN 4X4 WHEEL DRIVE FOR A LONG TIME. I KNOW AND SO DO MY PASSENGERS THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE. THE DASH BOARD ALWAYS INDICATED 2 WHEEL DRIVE NOT 4X4 UNLESS I PUT IT IN 4X4. THE AUTOMATIC 4X4 NEVER TURNED ON THE 4X4 DRIVE I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO PUT IT IN 4X4 IF I NEEDED TO USE IT, WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN ONE OTHER TIME. SO FOR A TRUCK THAT IS ONE YEAR OLD AND ONLY BEEN DRIVEN IN 4X4 WHEEL DRIVE TWICE THERE SEEMS TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF DAMAGE TO MY CLUTCHES AND MY FLUID SO BURNT. THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE ON THIS TRUCK. I WILL HAVE THE MODULE THAT CONTROLS THE \"CONTROL TRAC\" 4X4 WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM TESTED TO SEE IF IT FAILS TO ACTIVATE OR DE-ACTIVATE THE 4X4. THEN I WOULD LIKE FORD TO FIX THE PROBLEM OUT OF THEIR OWN EXPENSE AND STOP GIVING THEIR CLIENTS THE RUN-A-ROUND AND TO REIMBURSE ME FOR MY TIME AND EXPENSES. *JB",

AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY,2003, ON THE WAY HOME FROM A TRIP, MY HUSBAND AND I NOTICED THAT EVERY TIME WE SLOWED THE TRUCK DOWN, THERE WAS A BLAST OF AIR FROM THE UPPER VENTS IN THE VEHICLE.  THIS HAPPENED NO MATTER WHAT SETTING WE HAD IT IN (IE. DEFROST OR FLOOR VENTS).  THIS PAST THURSDAY, JAN.16, THE SUSPENSION WAS REPAIRED AND SUPPOSEDLY THE HEATING SYSTEM WAS AS WELL.  NOW THE AIR DOESN'T SEEM TO LEAK OUT THE TOP VENTS, BUT CONTINUOSLY COMES OUT OF THE FLOOR VENT, NO MATTER WHAT SETTING THE HEAT IS ON.

FORD ENGINEERS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND ARE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE 60-90 DAYS FOR A SOLUTION.  IN THE MEANTIME I WAS TOLD TO KEEP THE TANK 3/4 FULL OR LESS.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT I WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS DESIGN PROBLEM WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  IF IT IS A DESIGN PROBLEM THEN EVERY SPORT TRAC SHOULD BE EFFECTED.  IT IS A SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE THE 4 TIMES THE VEHICLE STALLED ON ME THREE OF THEM WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN.  ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD NO POWER STEERING OR BRAKES.  EVEN FOR MYSELF , A LARGE MALE, I HAD TROUBLE COMPLETING THE TURN.  I SHUDDER TO THINK BOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF MY 105 POUND DAUGHTER HAD BEEN DRIVING THE CAR AND IT HAD STALLED DURING A TURN.
