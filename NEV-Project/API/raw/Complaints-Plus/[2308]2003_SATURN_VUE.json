WHEN I TURN THE STEERING WHEEL, THERE IS A LOUD NOISE LIKE A RUBBER BAND IS BEING STRETCHED TO THE POINT OF BREAKING.  THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT DEALERSHIP REPORTED ON REPAIR INVOICE:  \"STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG COIL MAKING A NOISE.  THE NOISE IS DUE ONLY TO PLASTIC ITEMS MAKING CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THIS NOISE IS COMMON IN COLD WEATHER AND IS NOT AN AREA OF CONCERN AT THIS TIME\".      I LIVE IN A HIGH TEMPERATURE/HIGH HUMIDITY STATE AND THE PROBLEM IS CONSTANT - NOT ONLY IN WINTER.  AFTER VISITING THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY INSPECTED, THE NOISE WAS GONE BUT THAT LASTED ONLY FOR A WEEK OR SO AND IT RETURNED AND IT STILL PERSISTS TO THIS DATE.  I WAS THEN ADVISED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MANAGER TO USE A DRY SILICONE SPRAY ON THE STEERING COLUMN/AIR BAG AREA AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  IT DID NOT. OR, I COULD HAVE THE CURRENT DRIVER'S SIDE AIR BAG REPLACED AT MY OWN COST WHICH I OPTED NOT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE.  I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AIR BAG PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME.

WOULDN'T GO IN GEAR FOR THE DRIVE OR REVERSE!! SO SOMEONE CALLED A SHERIFF. I THEN CALLED A FRIEND WHO HAD TO COME AND PUSH VEHICLE OUT OF ROAD TRAFFIC. THIS TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED IN 2010 IT'S AS IF IT WAS NEVER DONE! THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION FOR WORK SO NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM OUT OF WORK YESTERDAY, AND TODAY!!! CALLING SATURN SERVICE AT 7:30 AM SURE THEY ARE GOING TO JUMP RIGHT ON IT (SARCASM). THE PAST MONTH THE ELECTRICAL WILL BLINK ON AND OFF. THEN AFTER A WHILE OF DRIVING IT GOES COMPLETELY OUT. UNTIL THE NEXT DRIVE THEN THE BLINKING STARTS. I HOPE NO ONE HAS A YOUNG NEW DRIVER ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE THESE VEHICLES. THEY ARE BY NO MEANS SAFE!!! MY 16 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WOULDN'T HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE WHAT I WENT THROUGH WITH THIS VEHICLE YESTERDAY. IT WOULD HAVE PUT A YOUNG FEMALE AT RISK!!! I DO NOT HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO SINK INTO  THIS VEHICLE I STILL OWE $7,000 ON AN UNDRIVEABLE VEHICLE. I AM A HOMEOWNER WITH A MORTGAGE AND A SINGLE PARENT THAT WORK HOURS HAVE BEEN CUT BACK DRASTICALLY AT WORK. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE LAWSUIT  UNTIL NOW I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN I WENT TO TRY AND TRADE THIS VEHICLE A FEW MONTHS BACK TO NO AVAIL MAKES SENSE NOW WHY NO CAR DEALER WANTED THIS VEHICLE!!! EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE WHY NO ONE WOULD TRADE! I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TRADE VEHICLES UNTIL NOW. THIS IS MY LAST GM VEHICLE. TO SAY THE LEAST.

THE OFFICERS NAME WAS [XXX]. I RECEIVED THE  LETTER FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROGRESSIVE STATING THAT HE DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE. THE FOLLOWING DAY AFTER THE ACCIDENT ON THE WAY HOME MY SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT, OIL LIGHT AND SEVERAL OTHER LIGHTS FLASHED. THERE WAS A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND BLACK SMOKE CAME POURING OUT AND EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN. I HAVE SINCE NOTICED THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS SAME THING BUT WAS TOLD IT IS NOT FOR MY SPECIFIC VIN NUMBER. I AM ARGUING WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO REPAIR THE ENGINE PART WHICH THEY SAID WAS NOT DUE TO THE ACCIDENT. I THINK THE IMPACT FROM THE WRECK KNOCKED THE OIL FILLER CAP OFF BECAUSE WHEN THE GEICO ADJUSTERS HAD THE CAR THEY COULD NOT FIND IT. I FOUND THE OIL FILLER CAP DOWN IN THE FRONT BETWEEN THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE AND FRONT OF THE CAR. OIL WAS ALL OVER THE ENGINE AND SEIZED FROM WHAT THE GEICO ADJUSTERS SAID. I AM PLACING A COMPLAINT WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ON GEICO FOR NOT PICKING ME UP FOR ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE, TAKING TO LONG TO REPAIR THE BUMPER, NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING TAKING SO LONG TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR THE CAR.

INITIALLY I EXPRESSED THE DESIRE FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE (A HONDA SUV) BUT THE SALES PEOPLE AT THE DEALERSHIP WERE ADAMANT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AND FINALLY TALKED ME INTO IT.  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BETTER THAN A HONDA SUV, ETC.  IN MARCH 2008 I MOVED TO CHARLOTTE N.C. BECAUSE OF A JOB OPPORTUNITY.  THEN IN THE SUMMER OF 2009 THE VEHICLE BEGAN MAKING A VERY PECULIAR NOISE.  I TOOK IT TO TWO TRANSMISSION SHOPS WHO REFUSED TO WORK ON IT.  AT THE TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY REFUSED THIS WORK.  HOWEVER, I WAS BLESSED WHEN THE SECOND ONE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD HEARD OF SOME ISSUE WITH THESE CARS AND RECOMMENDED I TAKE IT TO THE SATURN OF SOUTH BOULEVARD.  I DID SO.  IT TOOK ME THE ENTIRE SUMMER TO SCRATCH AND SAVE TO GET THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY ADVISED ME THAT GM WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE BULK OF THE COSTS BECAUSE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY TO SECOND OWNERS ON THE VEHICLE.  THAT'S ALL THEY TOLD ME.  IN AUGUST OF 2009 I FINALLY WAS ABLE TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PICK UP THE CAR WHICH THEY REPAIR THE TRANSMISSION TO THE TUNE OF APPROXIMATELY $3400.00.  FAST FORWARD TO APPROXIMATELY ON JANUARY 16, 2011 THE CAR BEGAN MAKING THE SAME PECULIAR NOISES.  NOW THIS IS ONLY 27,000 MILES AND 18 MONTHS LATER.  SO I TOOK IT TO 3 REPAIR SHOPS INCLUDING STEVE MOORE CHEVROLET ON SOUTH BOULEVARD (BECAUSE THEY DO ALL THE WORK FOR SATURN NOW I WAS TOLD).  THE ISSUE HAS NOW RECURRED. ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO I FOUND OUT THAT THE CAR WAS INITIALLY PUT ON THE STREET WITH THE WRONG TRANSMISSION WHICH IS WHY IT HAS ISSUES. AND I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT IN 2009 SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT SOME $5000 REIMBURSEMENT SO I COULD HAVE TRADED IT IN. DRIVING IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT CAN STOP WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. *TR",

WE FIGURED IT OUT PRETTY FAST AND LOOKED FOR AN ON RAMP WHILE WE TRIED TO \"PIGEON\" FOOT THE GAS AND BRAKE TO PREVENT A STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY,  THEN POWER STEERING WENT OUT AND THE DASHBOARD LOST POWER, WE KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY VERY WRONG AND THAT IF WE DIDN'T' GET OFF THE FREEWAY, WE COULD BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IF THE ENGINE LOST POWER. WE SPOTTED AN OFF RAMP AHEAD AND WITH NO POWER STEERING AND NO DASHBOARD LIGHTS WE CROSSED 3 LANES OF TRAFFIC, JUST AS WE HIT THE OFF RAMP THE CAR STARTED TO SPUTTER (RPM'S GOING UP AND DOWN) EVEN WITH OUR FOOT ON THE GAS, WE LOST ALL POWER AND THE ENGINE QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION AND ALMOST GOT HIT BY A TRUCK COMING DOWN THE HILL.  LUCKILY HE SWERVED AND MISSED ANOTHER CAR COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  WE PUSHED THE CAR TO AN INCLINE AND ROLLED THE CAR INTO A PARK AND RIDE WHERE MY HUSBAND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE FIGURED IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR SO WE HAD A FRIEND PICK ONE UP FOR US AND MEET AS THE PARK AND RIDE.  HE REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AND AS USUAL FOR JUMP STARTING A CAR, WE TURNED OFF ALL ELECTRICAL DRAWS (RADIO, A/C, FAN ECT.)  THE CAR STARTED UP, THE RPM'S FLUCTUATED BRIEFLY, THEN IT WAS OK. 2 WEEKS LATER THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED ON A HIGHWAY GOING 50 MPH, LUCKILY WE WERE ABLE TO PULL OVER AND TRY TO FIX IT AGAIN.  SAME THING, TURNED OFF ALL ELECTRICAL, JUMPED THE CAR AND STARTED RIGHT UP.  3 WEEKS LATER THE RPM'S STARTED FLUCTUATING AND WE FIGURED OUT WE NEEDED TO PIGEON THE GAS AND BRAKE SO IT WOULDN'T STALL AND LIMPED IT HOME.  SATURN SAYS IT'S THE BCM COMPUTER AND IT'S A \"COMMON\" PROBLEM.  WE NOW HAVE TO PAY $700 HUNDRED DOLLARS AND FIND A WAY TO GET THE SATURN TO THE DEALERSHIP WITHOUT WRECKING. *TR",

I WAS LEAVING FOR WORK ONE MORNING AND IT DIED AS I LEFT MY DRIVEWAY.  CALLED MY AUTO SHOP AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT TO THE SHOP FOR DIAGNOSIS.  THE WHOLE WAY THERE THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT WAS FLASHING.  THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT 2 CYLINDERS WERE MISFIRING AND HAD FAILED AND THAT MEANT THE IGNITION CONTROL MODULE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  ALONG WITH THAT THE SPARK PLUGS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE DONE BY THE MISFIRING.  TOTAL COST: $350.  PICKED UP THE CAR AND \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND WAS STEADY.  IT HAPPENED TO BE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND SO I COULDN'T TAKE MY CAR BACK IN RIGHT AWAY.  TOOK IT IN ON THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY, MIND YOU I GOT IT BACK ON FRIDAY NIGHT.  NOW IT IS THE DOWNSTREAM O2 SENSOR, UPSTREAM O2 SENSOR AND POSSIBLY THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  WAS ADVISED TO DEFINITELY REPLACE THE DOWNSTREAM O2 SENSOR, BUT WAS TOLD THAT THE UPSTREAM O2 SENSOR AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER COULD REPAIR THEMSELVES AFTER RUNNING A WHILE.  AFTER FINDING A RECALL ON MY YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL CALLED THE SATURN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AND BECAUSE I HAD PURCHASED IT USED THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE OR HELP ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FASHION.

I WAS ABLE TO PULL OF THE HIGHWAY AS MY SPEED WAS DECREASING BUT HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID TRAFFIC AND GET MYSELF TO SAFETY. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER WHO HAD IT TAKEN TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP WHO INFORMED ME DUE TO THIS SPECIFIC TRANSMISSION (VTI) THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM. I HAD IT FIXED AT  COST OF $4500. I RECEIVE A LETTER IN THE MAIL IN NOVEMBER OF 2009, FROM GM CANADA ADMITTING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AND THEY WERE OFFERING VARIOUS INCENTIVES. (EX A $5000 VOUCHER TOWARDS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE OR 50% REIMBURSEMENT TOWARDS A PREVIOUS REPAIR OR 50% TOWARDS A REPAIR AT PRESENT. WHEN I CALLED THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS OVER 160, 000 KM I WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY OF THESE INCENTIVES EVEN THOUGH AT THE TIME THE TRANSMISSION WENT THE CAR WAS AT 104,000. THEY OFFERED ME A $700 REIMBURSEMENT. AS THIS WAS GOING THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION WENT AGAIN,FORTUNATELY NOT OF THE HIGHWAY. IT AGAIN NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED FOR $5000, BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE AND I AM UNSURE IF I WANT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. I WAS EVEN TOLD WHEN BY AN AGENT AT GM NAMED ALEXIS WHEN I SAID THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE AND IT SHOULD BE RECALLED OR THE TRANSMISSION FIXED PROPERLY SHE STATED\"REGARDLESS OF IF THE VEHICLE IS SAFE OR NOT THIS IS OUR POLICY\" . THIS IS A KNOW PROBLEM WITH THE VTI TRANSMISSION AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BELT. THE ONLY RECTIFYING GM DOES IS TO PUT IN ANOTHER TRANSMISSION EXACTLY THE SAME. THIS CAR IS A HUGE SAFETY LIABILITY ESPC WHEN DRIVING AT HIGH  SPEEDS ON A HIGHWAY, NOT TO MENTION THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY. GM'S SOLUTION FOR THE $5000 VOUCHER FOR A NEW VEHICLE WAS A COBALT (HOW IRONIC AS THEY ARE NOW BEING RECALLED). THIS CAR IS VERY UNSAFE!!! *TR",

I FEEL IF THIS TRANSMISSION WAS DEEMED DEFECTIVE THAT IT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY GM AT THEIR EXPENSE.  I STILL HAVE TWO MORE YEARS TO PAY FOR THIS CAR AND WITH REDUCED VALUE I AM UPSIDE DOWN ON THIS CAR.  PLEASE HELP AND ADVISE ~ THANK YOU! *TR",

HOWEVER WE HAVE A 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND ARE EXPECTING OUR SECOND CHILD IN A FEW WEEKS AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNSAFE FOR US TO PUT OURSELVES, AND ESPECIALLY NOT OUR CHILDREN, IN SUCH A SITUATION. IT IS A TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN. WE HAVE CONTACTED LOCAL SATURN REPS, DISTRICT REPS, AND SATURN ASSISTANCE. ALL ARE UNWILLING TO HELP IN ANY WAY. THE LOCAL SATURN REPRESENTATIVE TOLD US HE WOULD NOT BUY THE CAR HIMSELF AND THAT THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT EVEN WANT TO PURCHASE IT FROM US IF WE FIXED IT. THEY KNOW IT IS UNSAFE AND STILL THEY WILL NOT HELP. WE ARE LEFT WITH A PARKED CAR IN OUR YARD THAT WE STILL OWE $5000 ON. WE DO NOT FEEL IT IS SAFE ENOUGH PUT OUR CHILDREN IN OR ANYONE ELSE. *TR",

THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND AND GAVE THE CAR BACK TO ME THE NEXT DAY (FRIDAY 04/10/09).  I DROVE THE CAR HOME (ABOUT 4 MILES) AND DID NOT DRIVE IT UNTIL I WENT TO WORK ON MONDAY (04/13/09). WORK IS 15 MILES AWAY.    WHEN I LEFT WORK I WAS SITTING AT A STOP LIGHT WITH MY CAR IN DRIVE AND MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE ONLY!   WITHOUT WARNING THE CAR LUNGED FORWARD LIKE AS IF I WERE TO PUSH THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.  I WAS INCHES FROM HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.    I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE TEMP WENT DEAD COLD.  THEN I PUT IT BACK INTO DRIVE AND THE TEMP WHEN BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE.  THIS HAPPENED ONCE MORE BEFORE THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN.    I GOT ON THE FREEWAY AND MY CAR DID NOT FEEL RIGHT (VERY SLUGGISH).  I HAD TO PUSH THE GAS PEDAL ABOUT 3/4 OF THE WAY TO THE FLOOR FOR THE CAR TO MOVE MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE.  THE ENGINE NOISE WAS BACK EVEN LOUDER THAN BEFORE.  I MADE IT TO THE DEALER BUT THEY WERE CLOSED FOR THE DAY SO I LEFT MY CAR OVER NIGHT.    THE NEXT DAY MY WIFE DROPPED ME OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I NEEDED TO PULL MY CAR INTO THE SERVICE BAY SO I STARTED MY CAR BUT JUST TURNING THE KEY BUT NOT PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL AND THE ENGINE REVVED TO OVER 3000 RPM.  I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND THE CAR DID NOT MOVE.  I NOTICED THAT MY DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS WERE FLASHING.  THE MORE GAS I GAVE THE CAR THE FASTER THE DAYTIME LIGHTS WOULD FLASH ON AND OFF.    THE SATURN MECHANIC TEST DROVE MY CAR AND USED SOME INSTRUMENT PLUGGED UNDER THE DASH.  HE CAME BACK FROM THE DRIVE AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS MY TRANSMISSION AGAIN!

THIS IS DUE TO THE ISSUE THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN REPORTING WITH THE VTI TRANSMISSIONS.  SINCE THE CAR IS ON IT'S 4TH TRANSMISSION (I AM COUNTING THE ONE THAT CAME WITH IT WHEN I GOT IT NEW) I AM CONCERNED THAT I WILL BE OUT OF LUCK WHEN MY MILEAGE REACHES 100,000 MILES.  SATURN SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER ANY ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION AFTER 100,000 MILES EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW.    I WAS LEFT STRANDED THE 1ST TIME, MY WIFE AND 3 KIDS WERE STRANDED THE 2ND TIME (WE LIVE IN LAS VEGAS AND THIS WAS IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT WAS ABOUT 115 DEGREES).  THE LAST TIME (THIS LAST WEEK) THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT SOON CAME ON AND I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE I BROKE DOWN.

EACH TIME THEY ATTEMPT TO FIX IT BY REPLACING THINGS, THE LAST TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY REPLACED ALL ELECTRONIC WIRING.    THIS IS A DANGEROUS DEFECT AS IT ONLY OCCURS AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS!  I KNOW THIS HAS AFFECTED OTHER VUE OWNERS BECAUSE I HAVE READ SEVERAL BLOGS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS.   *TR",

THEY SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAD IT TOWED TO SATURN OF RENTON.   NOVEMBER 13TH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED AND SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE TRANSMISSION BELT.  I SAID OK, SO PUT A NEW BELT ON.  THE SERVICE PERSON SAID, WELL THE \"TRANSMISSION IS SHATTERED\".  I SAID \"HOW ON EARTH DID THAT HAPPEN?!\"  HE TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION BELTS IN THE 2003 SATURN VUE'S ARE METAL, SO WHEN THEY BREAK, THEY SHATTER THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION. I SAID, SO THERE IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE TRANSMISSION THEN.  HE SAID, \"YES, I SEE A LOT OF THESE\".  HE TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $5,500.00 PLUS TAX TO FIX IT.  I CALLED THE SATURN COMPANY CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE.  I OPENED A FORMAL CASE AND WAS ASSIGNED TO AN \"ADVOCATE\".  THAT PERSON CALLED ME ON NOVEMBER 15TH AND SAID THAT BECAUSE IT IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE TRANSMISSION, THEY WOULD HONOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, WHICH ONLY TAKES $1,000.00 OFF OF THE REPAIRS.  I SAID THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH, SATURN NEEDED TO PAY THE FULL COST TO GET IT FIXED.  MY \"ADVOCATE\" SAID THAT WAS ALL SATURN WOULD DO, AND I HAD 30 DAYS TO DECIDE IF I WOULD ACCEPT. SATURN WILL DO NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS FAILURE.  THEY EVEN INSULTED YESTERDAY (DEC. 11TH) WHEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE ME ONLY $500.00 ON MY SATURN VUE AS THE TRADE-IN VALUE!   THEY SAID BECAUSE OF THE $5,000.00 TRANSMISSION JOB THAT HAD TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO RESELL IT.  I SAID \"THAT TRANSMISSION JOB WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING YOUR COMPANY DID, NOT ME...SO NOW SATURN IS SAYING, IN ESSENCE, 'WE SCREWED YOU OVER ONCE, AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO SCREW YOU OVER AGAIN'.

THE INSIDE PIVOT BOLT ON THE DRIVER SIDE REAR LATERAL LINK SHEARED OFF ON OUR SATURN VUE BEFORE HAVING THE RECALL WORK PERFORMED. THE BOLT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS THE M12-1.75X85MM 10.9 HARDNESS BOLT. MOMENTS BEFORE THE BOLT BROKE, MY WIFE AND ONLY CHILD WERE ON THE HIGHWAY. LUCKILY SHE WAS OFF THE HIGHWAY AND ONLY TRAVELING AROUND 20 MPH ROUNDING A CORNER WHEN THE BOLT SHEARED OFF. THAT VERY BOLT THAT SHEARED OFF WAS REPLACED WITH THE EXACT SAME DIAMETER AND HARDNESS BOLT AS PART OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION. TO ME, SATURN IS STILL COMPROMISING THE SAFETY OF MY WIFE AND ONLY CHILD. I CRAWLED UNDER A 2007 SATURN VUE ON THE SHOWROOM FLOOR AT SATURN OF BINGHAMTON. JUST AS I SUSPECTED...........THAT VERY SAME PIVOT BOLT UNDER THE 2007 WAS MUCH LARGER IN DIAMETER (16MM IN DIAMETER ROUGHLY). SO THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY APPARENT IN THE ENGINEERS DESIGN, BECAUSE THEY MADE A CHANGE TO THE NEWER VEHICLES. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A DESIGN FLAW, SO WHY WASN'T OURS FIXED CORRECTLY? WHAT'S FROM KEEPING THIS SAME BOLT FROM SHEARING OFF AGAIN IN SAY 2 OR 3 YEARS. THE M12 BOLT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T HAVE THE SHEAR STRENGTH FOR THAT APPLICATION. THAT IS WHY THEY ARE NOW PUTTING A MUCH LARGER DIAMETER BOLT IN ITS PLACE ON THE NEWER MODELS. ALL THESE 2002-2004 SATURN VUE OWNERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE WARM AND FUZZY FEELINGS ABOUT FEELING SAFE IN THEIR VEHICLE AGAIN NOW THAT THEY HAD THE RECALL CAMPAIGN PERFORMED. WHEN IN FACT THE MAJORITY DON??T EVEN HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE RECALL ENTAILED. SATURN IS BANKING ON THESE VEHICLES TO BE IN THE SCRAP YARD BEFORE ANYTHING MAJOR HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE, AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED!!! I ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE WITH SATURN CUSTOMER SERVICE ALREADY. THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING TOUGH LUCK, THE RECALL CORRECTIVE ACTION IS WHAT IT IS.   *JB",

SECONDLY, THE CAR MAKES A LOUD POPPING SOUND WHEN IDLING IF THE A/C OR HEATER IS ON.  THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS IS NORMAL.  IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.  THE VENTS ALSO BLOW AIR WHEN THE SYSTEM IS OFF.    MY VUE HAS 46,001 MILES.  I STAND BEHIND THE VEHICLE AND MY DEALERSHIP.  I JUST WISH THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT IS CAUSING IT TO REV OUT THE WAY IT DOES.  IT IS QUITE ALARMING WHEN IT HAPPENS.  *NM",

SATURN WAS CONCERNED ENOUGH TO HALT PRODUCTION OF THIS TRANSMISSION UNTIL IT WAS REMEDIED.SATURN HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THIS TRANSMISSION WHICH IS A NICE GESTURE BUT THE FACT IS I KNOW LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE WITH MY CHILDREN IN IT AND I THINK IF THEY HAVE FOUND AWAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND IT WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO STOP PRODUCTION TILL THEY FOUND IT, WELL THEN THIS SITUATION DEMANDS A RECALLL SO EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT ALL 82,000 OF US AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THERE VEHICLES COMING TO A DEAD STOP WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY.THIS PROBLEM WHICH HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE NY TIMES AND NY NEWSDAY AS I WILL SHOW YOU THE NEWSDAY STORY.   NY NEWSDAY  APRIL 30, 2004  SATURN TRANSMISSION FIX  GENERAL MOTORS SAYS IT HAS FIXED PROBLEMS WITH THE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION IT USES IN THE SATURN ION AND VUE AND IS OFFERING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO EASE BUYERS' FEARS -- FROM THREE YEARS/36,000 MILES TO FIVE YEARS/75,000 MILES.    GM YANKED THE FUEL-SAVING GEARBOX FROM PRODUCTION IN JANUARY BECAUSE OF DURABILITY PROBLEMS WITH THE STEEL BELT INSIDE THE GEARBOX THAT CONNECTS TO PULLEYS. INSTALLATION OF THE CVT RESUMED IN MARCH ON THE ION COUPE AND SHOULD RESUME IN MAY WITH THE VUE SUV.    THE NEW WARRANTY COVERS ALL CVT-EQUIPPED SATURNS PRODUCED SINCE THE SUMMER OF 2002, A TOTAL OF ABOUT 82,000.*AK",

THE \"HEAD\" MECHANIC AT THE SATURN DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THE PROBLEM AT ALL.  INSTEAD, HIS COMMENT REGARDING IT WAS, \"THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST\".  TODAY, A (SUPERVISOR) OF CUSTOMER RELATIONS TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS \"NOT A DESIGN FLAW\" EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS INFORMED THAT MY PROBLEM IS IN EACH AND EVERY VUE BEING SOLD.   I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS VEHICLE PASSED INSPECTION STANDARDS WITH THIS DEFINITIVE PROBLEM.  TRUE, IT MAY NOT (TO SOME) APPEAR TO BE A \"MAJOR\" SAFETY RISK BUT TO OTHERS, IT IS.  AS I EXPLAINED TO SATURN TODAY, THIS FAULT WAS PURPOSELY KEPT FROM ME FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SELLING THE VEHICLE.  HAD SATURN BEEN UP-FRONT IN ADVISING ME OF THIS FAULT, I WOULD NEVER HAVE CLOSED THE DEAL AND WOULD HAVE EITHER PURCHASED A DIFFERENT MODEL (NO OTHER SATURN HAS THIS PULLING PROBLEM) OR GONE TO SOME OTHER AUTO MANUFACTURER.  THIS PROBLEM (TO MY KNOWLEDGE) HAS NOT RESULTED IN ANY INJURIES OR FAILURES (TO DATE) BUT I WISH TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT ANYWAY IN THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE BEFORE IT LEADS TO SERIOUS ACCIDENTS.
