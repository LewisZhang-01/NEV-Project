No change to consumption after picking up car. KSDS software update performed. Flashing CEL and breakdown on highway several months later. Different dealer diagnosed needed repair as \"engine replacement\". Neither dealer nor Kia consumer care (KCAC) would do ANYTHING to take care of problem. Ignored my letter, and stiff-armed at every step. BTW, I bought 2 brand new cars from this dealership. Terrible quality and even worse customer service, if that is possible. Clearly this is a known issue and Kia is doing their darnedest to not have to add the Forte model to their recall as this is their biggest seller with this engine.

My car caught fire in the parking lot where I work in southern Louisiana while I was in northern Mississippi on the job. The car was locked and both keys were with me. The wires, the trunk door, the cloth covering over the top of the trunk, and back window burned. Some water bottles, sprite bottles and the empty bag of cat food they were placed on the day before burned. The plastic binders, the bottom of the trunk, and the spare tire space did not burn. It is clear the car had a defect. The fire could have reached the gas tank and caused an explosion. The wires burned causing the fire. The car set itself on fire. Even though the car is under the 10 year, 100,000 mile Waranty. They will not acknowledge the defect, the warranty, or responsibility. I was told by the Kia representative of my claim that they determined the light bulb did not cause the fire so there is nothing they can do. They could not determine what did cause the fire. They said they are not responsible. I believe they knowingly sold vehicles that would catch fire to a clueless public and did nothing to fix the electrical defects.",

BEFORE I RECEIVED THIS RECALL LETTER AND TOOK MY CAR IN TO GET LOOKED AT, I HAD NO ISSUES WITH MY CAR ACCELERATING AND HAVE NEVER HAD A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CAR DOESN'T DRIVE. THE DEALERSHIP DAMAGED MY CAR AND ARE DENYING ANY WRONGDOING. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO HAVE MY CAR IN THIS CONDITION  I'M NOT WILLING TO RISK MY FAMILY'S SAFETY OR MY OWN SAFETY BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE MANUFACTURER WON'T GO THROUGH WITH THE REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE DONE FOR SAFETY REASONS AND REPLACE MY ENGINE. THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT LISTENING TO THEIR MECHANICS THAT HAVE TOLD ME THE ENGINE IS GUARANTEED TO FAIL. MY VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVABLE AND KIA WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I HAVE NO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT GIVE ME A LOANER CAR TO DRIVE FOR THE TIME EITHER.",

THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY, BUT MY ENTIRE ENGINE HAD JUST BLOWN OUT FOR NO REASON. MY CAR WAS ONLY AT 87,000 MILES AND IT WAS JUST TOTALLED. I WASN'T WORRIED INITIALLY BECAUSE I PAID EXTRA FOR THE WARRANTY TO FIX ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS LIKE THIS, HOWEVER I CAME TO FIND OUT THE WARRANTY REFUSED TO COVER THE ENTIRE COST TO REPLACE THE PRICE OF A NEW ENGINE IN MY VEHICLE AND ON TOP OF THAT, WHEN THE ENGINE BLEW IT KILLED THE COMPUTER IN MY CAR, AND THE DEALERSHIP ALSO STRONGLY ADVISED I REPLACED SEVERAL OTHER THINGS ON THE VEHICLE. I'D HAVE TO PULL OUT MY RECEIPTS TO GIVE YOU ALL AN EXACT AMOUNT BUT WE PAID AT LEAST $5,000 - $10,000 OUT OF POCKET FOR THE ENGINE AND COMPUTER ALONE.

CAR WAS INSPECTED BY DEALER AND YORK KIA (SEPT 18) CLAIMED NO PERMANENT DAMAGE TO MY ENGINE AS A RESULT.  (VEHICLE PASSED EMISSIONS/SAFETY TWO WEEKS LATER - MONROE MUFFLER & BREAK, YORK PA) AS MY CAR DIDN'T SEEM TO BE LEAKING OIL, SUBSEQUENT VIGILANCE BY ME REVEALED THAT MY CAR WAS BURNING OIL.  TWO FOLLOW-UP VISITS SINCE SEPTEMBER TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM WITH LANCASTER PA KIA (LAST 11/27 - 11/28 (81,500 K ON ENGINE) AND WORK WITH GWC (POWER TRAIN $2,100 WARRANTY) AN AFTERMARKET WARRANTY HAVE BEEN REJECTED DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT MY CAR IS BURNING OIL IN EXCESS OF SPECS.  AS I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, NOR DID I PURCHASE THIS AS A CERTIFIED VEHICLE, AS THERE IS NO ACTIVE RECALL, KIA WILL NOT REMEDY.     MAINTENANCE RECORDS SUPPORT THAT THIS VEHICLE WASN'T MECHANICALLY NEGLECTED AND MAINTAINED BY ALL PREVIOUS OWNERS.      IF YOU REQUEST NOTES FROM THE DEALERS THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PLEASE CALL ME AT [XXX] AND LEAVE ME A MESSAGE SO I KNOW WHAT THE CALL IS REGARDING.  IN ADDITION MY EMAIL IS [XXX]  THANK YOU.      PS.  AS THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE, AND NOT REALLY SAFE, INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A RECALL FOR MY MAKE AND MODEL WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ON HOW I HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH MY CURRENT VEHICLE.

THE METAL FROM THE BEAM WHICH SECURES THE STEERING COLUMN TEARS, AND CAUSES THE STEERING COLUMN TO BECOME UNSECURED AND IT FALLS, LEAVING NO CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE WHETHER IT IS IN MOTION OR AT A STANDSTILL.

AFTER LISTENING TO NEWS REPORTS THROUGH YOUTUBE I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SERVICE PERSON.   FROM WHAT I AM HEARING FROM THE MEDIA....THE GLASS ON TOP IS BEING MADE THINNER BECAUSE OF WEIGHT CONCERNS.   ALSO, MY BODY SHOP ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THE DESIGN OF OUR KIA IS SLOPED AND THE GLASS IS MORE EXPOSED RATHER THAN BEING ON A \"FLAT\" ROOF DESIGN VEHICLE OF SAY AN OLDER FORD EXPLORER TYPE VEHICLE.   IF THE GLASS ON CERTAIN DESIGNED VEHICLES IS MORE EXPOSED BY SLOPING FORWARD THEN ALL THE MORE REASON TO HAVE A GLASS THAT WON'T SHATTER OR THAT IS THICKER.   IF THE SLOPED DESIGN MAKES THE GLASS MORE EXPOSED....THEN IT MAY ALSO BE THAT IT ONLY TAKES A VERY SMALL ROCK BEING THROWN BY A VEHICLE IN FRONT TO SHATTER A THINNER GLASS ON A SLOPED DESIGN VEHICLE...AND A ROCK SIZE THAT A DRIVER WOULD NOT NOTICE.

I CAN DRIVE MANY MILES AND NOTHING CHANGES TILL THE TEMP OUTSIDE GOES UP.  THEY TELL ME THAT IS THE WAY IT IS THAT THEY CAN'T FIX IT AND THEY SAID IT WORKED FOR THEM SO THAT IS IT.  IF YOU HAVE IT ON FULL DEFROST AT 30 BELOW, YOU FREEZE YOUR TOES AND FINGERS.  SOME THING SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS IN AN ACCIDENT.  I LOVE THE CAR OTHERWISE.  *TR",

WELL THE FIRST ONE HAD A KNOCK IN THE MOTOR SO THE DEALERSHIP \"EXCHANGED\" IT AND THIS ONE THE SEAT TAKES ABOUT 5 MIN TO LOCK INTO PLACE AFTER YOU ADJUST IT AND YOU HAVE TO BE DRIVING FOR IT TO LOCK IN. THERE IS A KNOCK WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEELS AND THE DEALERSHIP SAYS KIA IS WORKING TO FIX IT & TRY NOT TO DRIVE IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN... THE FUEL TANK KEEPS LEAKING AND NEEDING TO BE REPLACED BUT THERE WORKING ON THAT TOO I'M SURE.... HAHA AFTER OUR CAR BEING IN THE SHOP FOR 36 DAYS I FINALLY WAS CALLED BY KIA AND OFFERED A SETTLEMENT UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THE ISSUES... THE SETTLEMENT WAS NOT EASY THE GIRL WHO CALLED ME WAS EXTREMELY RUDE AND EVERYTHING I HAD LOOKED UP ABOUT THE LAWS SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD TO KEEP EITHER \"GOOGLING\" IT OR SHE WENT TO ASK HER BOSS & THEN WOULD COME BACK OH YOUR I GUESS RIGHT... KIA WAS DOING GOOD FOR AWHILE BUT SADLY I THINK THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO HAVING THE BUY 2 GET 1 FREE SALE AGAIN...  *TR",

I HAD THE BRAKES PRESSED DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND STILL COULDN'T STOP IN TIME TO PREVENT IMPACT, THERE WERE NOT EVEN ANY SKID MARKS ON THE PAVEMENT. THE IMPACT WAS SO STRONG THAT MY BACK SEATS FOLDED DOWN AND THE THINGS I HAD IN MY TRUNK FLEW FORWARD AND HIT THE BACK OF THE DRIVER SEAT. I HAD GLASS BOTTLES OF DRINKS IN THE TRUNK AND THEY WERE ALL BUSTED IN THE FLOORBOARD FROM BEING THROWN THROUGH THE BACK SEAT THAT FOLDED DOWN. FIRE AND RESCUE HAD TO OPEN MY DOOR TO LET ME OUT OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I TRIED TO GET OUT AND COULDN'T PRY THE DOOR OPEN. TO ME THAT IS A HARD IMPACT, I WAS INJURED AND STILL SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION. MY CONCERN IS WITH A FRONTAL IMPACT OF SUCH FORCE, NONE OF MY AIRBAGS DEPLOYED! MY ACCIDENT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED AND I AM HURT BUT I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. LUCKILY I WAS WEARING MY SAFETY BELT BECAUSE MY AIRBAGS CERTAINLY DIDN'T PROTECT ME.  I MADE A COMPLAINT WITH KIA AND THERE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME...\"MA'AM WITH YOUR VEHICLE, YOU HAVE \"SMART AIRBAGS\" THEY ONLY DEPLOY IN A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.\" HOW CAN THE CAR TELL WHAT IS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT...MY 8 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT BACK SEAT THAT FOLDED OR EVEN MY NEWBORN NIECE THAT I CARE FOR, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY CATASTROPHIC BUT FATAL!!! WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS? PLEASE HELP, I DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO SUFFER.  *TR",
