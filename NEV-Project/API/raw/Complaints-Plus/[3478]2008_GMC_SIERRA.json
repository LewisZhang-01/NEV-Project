        "summary": "I started my 2008 GMC Sierra, crew cab and began to pull my drivers side seat belt across my body to latch it. I was about 1/2 way when I heard a loud bang that sounded like a gun going off to my right, the seat belt that I had in my hand pulled back tight pulling my hand with it. There was smoke and the smell of gun powder coming from the bottom of the passenger seat by the seat belt. With my heart pounding in my chest I got out of my truck as quickly as I could (my driver's side door was still open). Both the driver's side and passenger side seat belts were pulled tight and I was unable to get either to release. The truck is now sitting, unable to be driven safely with the seat belt on. The dealership said it would be just under $1,000 to fix plus towing and has no idea how or why it happened. This truck has never been in an accident and currently has about 140,000 mostly highway miles on it and I am the original owner. Searching online I found that there are other people on blogs who have had similar problems with exploding seat belt modules with a range of 40,000 miles to over 150,000 miles.",

I HAVE A VEHICLE THAT I'M MAKING PAYMENTS ON THAT I CAN'T DRIVE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL OF GETTING HURT OR KILLED BY THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE INSTALLED TO PROTECT YOU!  WHEN IS THE AUTO MANUFACTURER GOING TO MAKE THIS MANUFACTURER ACCOUNTABLE?  WHEN IS OUR GOVERNMENT GOING TO MAKE THIS MANUFACTURER ACCOUNTABLE?    WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT SINCE 2015-2016 AND STILL THERE ARE THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF VEHICLES THAT ARE TICKING TIME BOMBS THAT NO ONE IS TAKING SERIOUSLY UNTIL AFTER THE FACT YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  WE NEED HELP THAT IS COMING WAY TO SLOW BECAUSE OF THE MONEY INVOLVED IN CORRECTING THIS DEADLY PROBLEM.  WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS MANUFACTURER PROVIDE EVERYONE THAT HAS A VEHICLE UNDER THIS RECALL PROVIDE US WITH A RENTAL VEHICLE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH OUR LIVES!  WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE MANUFACTURER GIVE US FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR OUR VEHICLES SO WE CAN PURCHASE A SAFER VEHICLE?  I'M SICK AND TIERED OF BEING TOLD THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT PART AVAILABLE YET!

OVER THE LAST 9 MONTHS MULTIPLE, PENETRATING CRACKS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE TOP OF THE PLASTIC DASHBOARD DUE TO CAUSE(S) UNKNOWN. THIS HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE DASHBOARD TO THE POINT THAT AT LEAST ONE TOP PIECE OF THE DASHBOARD IS LOOSE DUE TO THE CRACKS. TWO CRACKS ARE IN THE CENTER OF THE DASHBOARD TOP AND ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DASHBOARD IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG. CURRENT MILES ON THE ODOMETER ARE 146,000.     IN THE EVENT OF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT DURING A CRASH, THE LIKELIHOOD IS VERY HIGH THAT PLASTIC FROM THE DASHBOARD COULD FRACTURE, BECOME AIRBORNE, AND RESULT IN INJURY TO OCCUPANT(S) OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO EITHER THE NORMAL DEPLOYMENT VELOCITY OF THE TAKATA PASSENGER AIRBAG, OR WORSE YET IF THE PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATOR FAILS TO FUNCTION AS DESIGNED AND ACTIVATES WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE.     THIS VEHICLE IS SUBJECT TO RECALL NHSTA #16V381, ISSUED 5/27/2016 FOR DEFECTIVE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATORS. FURTHER, THE VEHICLE HAS SPENT ITS ENTIRE OPERATING LIFE IN THE \"ZONE A\" HIGH ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY REGION (FLORIDA). IN AND OF ITSELF, THE CRACKING DASHBOARD PRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD DURING A CRASH WITH AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT. HOWEVER, COMBINED WITH CONDITIONS RECORDED IN RECALL 16V381, I MAINTAIN THIS COMBINED HAZARD PRESENTS AN UNACCEPTABLE LIFE SAFETY RISK. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE NHTSA IMMEDIATELY INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE NOTED DASHBOARD CRACKS ON BOTH GM AND GMC GMT900 TRUCK PRODUCTS, AND FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT A RECALL ACTION BE SUGGESTED TO GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION ON GMT900 VEHICLES REGISTERED IN \"ZONE A\" TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE DASHBOARDS.

THE DIAGNOSTIC COST WAS $132.93, AND THAT WAS TO JUST FOR PLUGGING IN THE TECH 2 SCAN TOOL AND RUNNING THE SIR AIR BAG DIAGNOSTIC TEST. I WAS NOT THRILLED ABOUT IT.  PROBLEM TURNED OUT TO BE A FAILURE OF THE FRONT LEFT AIR BAG SENSOR. THE DEALER SAID \"OH WE HAVE ONE IN STOCK AT OUT OTHER LOCATION, WE CAN GET IT SHIPPED OVER, AND IT WOULD COST $550 BUT WE COULD HAVE THE TRUCK BACK TO YOU LATER THIS EVENING.\" HOW DOES ONE OF THESE JUST FAIL? IF ITS DUE TO CORROSION SHOULDN'T GM PICK UP THE TAB ON THAT? THIS SAFETY COMPONENT IS WHAT SENSES IMPACT THEN CAUSES THE AIRBAG TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY AND THIS PART JUST RANDOMLY FAILS? HOW IS THAT ACCEPTABLE FOR ANY MANUFACTURER, IF THERE IS A CORROSION ISSUE, FIND A MEANS TO PREVENT FURTHER FAILURES AND COVER THE COST OF REPLACEMENT FOR THOSE THAT DO FAIL. FOR A GMC TRUCK THAT USES THE PHRASE \"WE ARE PROFESSIONAL GRADE\" AS THE BACKBONE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS, WHY WOULD THEY USE PARTS THAT FAIL SO EASILY? SINCE SOME OF THEIR TRUCKS USED TO BE BE ASSEMBLED IN WISCONSIN, AND THEIR HEAD QUARTERS IS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN, IT'S VERY HARD TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THESE PLACES ARE NOT KIND TO VEHICLES.

THEY LATER RUN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST AT GM REQUEST AND FOUND A MYSTERIOUS IGNITION CODE BUT NO SOLUTION.

LATER IN THE MORNING AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30AM I FOUND MY 2008 SIERRA TRUCK RUNNING IN MY GARAGE WITH THE GARAGE DOORS SHUT. THE HEADLIGHTS WERE FLASHING AND THE GARAGE WAS EXTREMELY HOT DUE TO THE ENGINE RUNNING. THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER CONDENSATION ON THE FLOOR INDICATING THAT THE ENGINE HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WAS AT RUNNING TEMPERATURE. MY KEYS WERE IN THE IGNITION SO I OPENED THE GARAGE TO AIR OUT THE CARBON MONOXIDE AND TOOK MY WIFE'S KEYS AND TRIED TO STOP IT REMOTELY BUT IT WOULD NOT STOP. A FEW MINUTES LATER I WENT OUTSIDE AND CAME IN THRU THE GARAGE DOOR TRYING NOT TO BREATH THE FUMES. BY THEN THE TRUCK WAS NOT RUNNING. I FOUND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON. WHEN I TOUCHED THE KEY IN THE IGNITION THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OUT. THE SEAT PRESETS WERE MESSED UP AND THE CLOCK WAS SEVERAL HOURS OFF. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THE TRUCK WAS REMOTE STARTED. EVEN IF IT WAS IT SHOULD ONLY RUN FOR 10 MINUTES. THIS WAS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS SITUATION! CONTINUING ON WITH A SIMILAR SITUATION A YEAR AGO, THERE WAS A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM COMING THRU. OUR NEIGHBORS HAD COME TO OUR HOUSE DURING THE WARNING SINCE WE HAD A BASEMENT. WE WERE ALL STANDING IN THE GARAGE WITH THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN AND OUR 2010 GMC YUKON STARTED UP LIKE SOMEONE TURNED ON THE IGNITION. THERE WERE NO KEYS IN THE IGNITION. THE ELECTRICAL STORM WAS ON-GOING WHEN THIS HAPPENED. WE SAW OUR NEIGHBOR LEAVE IN HER YUKON SO WE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE REMOTE STARTED HERS SO I FOLLOWED UP WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE HAD REMOTED STARTED HER CAR AND SHE HAD NOT. SHE TRIED TO REMOTE START HER CAR AND IT DID NOT AFFECT OURS WHATSOEVER. IT APPEARS THAT BOTH INCIDENTS SEEM TO BE STORM RELATED. IT IS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS SITUATION KNOWING  THIS COULD HAPPEN WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP OR AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS.  *TR",

APPARENTLY, I WAS NOT CONVINCING ENOUGH TO GM THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FLIMSY MIRRORS - PERHAPS NHTSA AND BBB CAN BE MORE PERSUADING.  ALL I ASKED FOR WAS THAT THEY COVER THE FLIMSY PLASTIC ACTUATOR AND PART OF THE $93 LABOR QUOTED FOR THE JOB BY THE DEALER.  THE MIRROR ITSELF I HAVE NO QUALMS PAYING FOR.  OLD PARTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE TRUCK - I PLAN TO DRIVE MY NEARLY NEW TRUCK \"AS IS\" FOR A WHILE AS A SYMBOL OF GM'S POOR QUALITY OF WORKMANSHIP AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I ALSO PLAN ON TELLING AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE ABOUT HOW FLIMSY GM MAKES THEIR VEHICLES AND HOW NON-EXISTENT THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS.  *TR",
