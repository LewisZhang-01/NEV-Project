SO I CALL GM AND THEY PAID FOR IT. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE PERSONAL BODY MODULE AND WOULD RUN AROUND $1300. I NEW ABOUT THE KEY RECALL AND THOUGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. SO I WAITED UNTIL BUICK FIXED MY KEY PROBLEM, BUT THE AIRBAG DID NOT GO AWAY. THEN THE NEXT (LIGHT RECALL) CAME UP, WHICH IS STILL NOT REMEDIED SO I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT IS NOT A PART OF THE PROBLEM. SINCE, I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM MY ELDERLY NEIGHBOR, SHE SAID THAT SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES TO THE BUICK DEALER, (ANDY MOHR) AND THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING. THEY TOLD HER THAT WHENEVER IT HAPPENS TO BRING THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP. WELL, WITH ALL INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS IT IS VERY HARD FOR A PERSON TO GET THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHILE IT IS HAPPENING.

I HAVE READ THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. I WISH U LET US UPLOAD PICTURES OF THIS INCIDENT. WHAT IF WHILE DRIVING MY CAR HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE OR SOMETHING WORSE COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME OR MY CHILD.  LUCKILY I WAS OUT OF MY VEHICLE WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED. THIS ISSUE HAS TO BE LOOKED AT. NOW I HAVE TO TOW MY CAR OUT OF MY WORK GARAGE PAY FOR THAT AND THEN PAY FOR MY VEHICLE TO GET FIX WHICH WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET REIMBURSED FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A RECURRING ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. IT CAN TURN OUT TO BE A BIG LAW SUIT AGAINST BUICK. I HAD THE SAME ISSUE ALSO WITH THE HEADLIGHTS. I WOULD BE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND OUT OF NO WHERE MY LIGHTS WOULD JUST SHUT OFF. HAD TO REPLACE THAT ALSO. . .UPDATED 07/21/15 *BF   UPDATED 11/9/2015 *JS",

WHY IS IT NOT ADEQUATE?    1) IT DOES NOT INSURE THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE KEYS WILL NOT CAUSE SHUTDOWN. IT ONLY MAKES IT A LITTLE LESS LIKELY.    2) IN A YEAR'S TIME, EVEN THE CURRENT OWNER'S WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SOLUTION.

THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THEY WOULD CALL THE DEALER TO RESOLVE THE  PROBLEM,  AND ADVISED THE CONTACT TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALER.
