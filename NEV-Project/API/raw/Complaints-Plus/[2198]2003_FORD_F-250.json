Ford knows about the problem but is doing nothing to correct! I have finally found a shop that will fix the broken exhaust manifold blots ! But I would like to know what ford truly knows about this problem . To get it fixed they have to replace all the bolts do to the bolts being so rusted ! Now I only have 121, + miles on my2003 and with the bolts broken it starts admitting gas fumes into the cab . I did check your site and could only find but 1 complaint , so if this is an issue with the exhaust manifold bolts braking and all the ford forums are full of complaints where are they being filed at on your site ? And I do believe it is an issue because I have spoken to 5 different shoppes  and 1 ford dealer , they all say the same thing SORRY but it is your problem ! ford knows but will not do anything about it ! I am having mine put in the shop  for repairs on the week of 7 Feb 2022 , now that I found someone I could afford! I had quotes from I will not do the work because it is a V10 to $1000.00 per bolt please address this ! It won\u2019t help me but maybe it will hold ford accountable for the product !",

I HAVE BEEN BACK AND FORTH WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY, I HAVE BEEN LIED TO, STRONG ALONG, CALLS NOT RETURNED AND SO ON. THE DESIGN FLAW HAS TO DO WITH THE EGR. AND TODAY ITS SEEMS THE 3RD NEW TURBO STOPPED WORKING AND THE MOTOR HAS STARTED TO HAVE A BAD VIBRATION. THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE AND EVEN THOUGH FORD KEPT TELLING ME THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF ME, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. WHEN THE TURBO FAILED AS I WAS TRYING TO GET ONTO THE FREEWAY I HAD NO POWER AND NEARLY WAS REAR ENDED BY AN 18 WHEELER WHO WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY. I HAD TO STAY OFF THE FREEWAY ON OTHER ROADS TILL I COULD GET HOME. THE TRUCK DEVELOPED A BAD VIBRATION AND I WAS NOT SURE I WOULD GET IT HOME. IF I WOULD HAD BEEN TOLD BY FORD THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT IN OF THE DESIGN FLAW AND THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX IT, I WOULD HAVE NEVER POURED SO MUCH MONEY INTO IT. IT IS A LEMON AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED. I HAVE TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE AND RESEARCHED THIS TRUCK. I FOUND OUT FORD NEW OF THIS DESIGN FLAW AND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE THESE PROBLEMS BUT RELEASED THE TRUCK TO US ANYWAY. I NOW CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT ANY MORE MONEY INTO THIS TRUCK, I CAN'T FIX IT, I CAN'T SELL IT, AND FORD WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME. WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS LIED TO AND CAUGHT THEM AND SAID, I NOW YOU HAVE BEEN LYING TO ME AND I DO NOT TRUST YOU, I WAS LABELED A HOSTEL CUSTOMER. I ASK YOU, WHO LIKES TO BE LIED TO? THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON INTO 2 YEARS NOW. NOW I HAVE NO TRUCK. I AM INTERNING WHERE IT ASKS \"WHEN THIS HAPPENED\" TODAY'S DATE. PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU.",

THE NEXT DAY I OPENED THE HOOD TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I FOUND CYLINDER #2 HAD BLOWN APART THE COIL PACK AND HAD ALSO EJECTED THE SPARK PLUG FROM THE CYLINDER HEAD. FOLLOWING THAT I TOOK REMOVED ALL OTHER COILS AND PLUGS TO FIND THAT 5 OF THE 8 WERE LOOSE AND WORKING THEIR WAY OUT OF THE THREADS. I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY THING THAT PREVENTED AN ENGINE FIRE WAS THE FACT THAT THE SPARK PLUG HAD SHORTED ITSELF OUT. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE ON MANY YEARS AND MODELS AND IS DUE TO FAULTY CYLINDER HEADS THAT WERE MADE OF ALUMINUM THAT WAS TO SOFT.

ON MARCH 16, 2004, THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE WENT COMPLETELY FLAT AS I WAS SITTING AT A RED LIGHT. I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND FOUND THAT THE TIRE HAD A RIP ACROSS THE SIDE WALL APPROXIMATELY 5 INCHES LONG. THE TIRES (AND TRUCK) HAVE LESS THAN 12,000 MILES ON THEM.     I CALLED FORD, AND THEY REFERRED ME TO A LOCAL FIRESTONE DEALER. AT THE FIRESTONE DEALER, ONE OF THE MECHANICS LOOKED AT THE TIRE AND SAID THERE WAS NO APPARENT REASON FOR THE TIRE TO SPLIT, BUT A MANAGER WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT BEFORE IT COULD BE REPLACED. THE MANAGER LOOKED AT IT AND SAID I MUST HAVE HIT A LARGE ROCK OR SOMETHING. I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS SITTING AT A SIGNAL LIGHT WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THAT THE TRUCK HAD NEVER BEEN OFF THE PAVEMENT. HE SAID MAYBE SOMEBODY CAME BY AND CUT IT OR STUCK AN ICE PICK IN IT (AS IF I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED THAT IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR). THEN HE TOLD ME IT WAS FORD'S FAULT BECAUSE THEY WERE USING THE WRONG KIND OF TIRE FOR SUCH A BIG VEHICLE, BUT HE WOULD SELL ME A NEW ONE AT A DISCOUNT. THE FIRESTONE WEBSITE HAS SPECS FOR THIS TIRE, AND SPECIFICALLY STATES THEY ARE FOR FORD F250/F350. I REFUSED HIS OFFER, AND CALLED FORD AGAIN.     THIS TIME THEY REFERRED ME TO FIRESTONE CUSTOMER CARE. I CALLED AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THESE TIRES, BUT THAT THEY WOULD NOTE MY COMPLAINT IN THEIR SYSTEM. THEY ALSO TOLD ME SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKE SURE I SAFELY BUCKLE MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE IN THE VEHICLE.     I'VE FOUND A NUMBER OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE TIRES ON THE INTERNET. AT THIS POINT, FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, I'M HAVING ALL FOUR TIRES REPLACED WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN FIRESTONE/BRIDGESTONE TIRES. I'M KEEPING THE TIRE THAT BLEW OUT AND THE RECEIPT FROM THE NEW TIRES TO SUBMIT TO FIRESTONE IN THE FUTURE IF A RECALL IS PUT IN PLACE.*AK",
