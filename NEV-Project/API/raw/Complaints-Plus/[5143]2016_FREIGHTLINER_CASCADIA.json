WAS ABLE TO SAFELY GET TO AN EXIT OFF RAMP TO PARK AND INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE. REPLACED THE MOTOR AND LINKAGE AS RECOMMENDED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. NOW 11 MONTHS LATER, WIPERS STOP COMPLETELY FOR NO REASON AT ALL. WHEN I TURN THE WIPERS BACK OFF, THEN BACK ON, STILL NOTHING. IMMEDIATELY I PULL VEHICLE TO SHOULDER TO INVESTIGATE, BUT COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG. I RESTART VEHICLE AND TO MY SURPRISE THE WIPERS BEGIN TO WORK. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE IN TWO WEEKS, BOTH TIMES IN HEAVY RAIN. ONCE ON NEW YORK THRUWAY HEADING SOUTH JUST NORTH OF THE MAHWAH REST AREA AND THEN ON I-87, NORTHWAY AT EXIT 4. BOTH TIMES I WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CORRECT THE ISSUE BY TURNING OFF THE TRUCK FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN RESTARTING. THE WIPERS BEGAN WORKING AGAIN AFTER THAT. VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE VEHICLE TO SHOULDER TO INVESTIGATE BOTH TIMES. WIPERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFE OPERATION OF A VEHICLE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THE MOTOR AND LINKAGE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A YEAR FROM THE TIME IT WAS INSTALLED. EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD ON LINKAGE, NOTHING BINDING OR CATCHING, ALSO FUSES ARE GOOD. ALL WIRING GOOD AS WELL.
