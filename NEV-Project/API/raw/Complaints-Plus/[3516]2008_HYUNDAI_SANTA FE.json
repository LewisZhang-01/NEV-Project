IT APPEARS THAT HYUNDAI MAY BE CONCEALING DATA FROM NHTSA REGARDING CORROSION PROBLEMS ON ITS VEHICLES.

HOWEVER, MY ESC OFF LIGHT AND ABS LIGHT ARE AGAIN LIGHTING UP. I HAVE (LUCKILY) NOT YET HAD LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OR CONTROL.  THE SECOND ISSUE IS IN REGARDS TO CAMPAIGN 936. I'VE HAD THE FRONT ENGINE VALVE GASKET COVER FIXED, ALONG WITH MY ALTERNATOR REPLACED (AFTER MY HUSBAND AND I DID IT OURSELVES AFTER LOSING ALL POWER ON CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE MIDDLE OF ROAD BEFORE BARELY COASTING INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OF PARK OUT OF THE WAY). WE CHANGED MY OIL THIS WEEKEND, HAVE HAD NO OTHER WORK DONE ON THE CAR SINCE (EXCEPT OIL CHANGES) AND MY HUSBAND NOTICED THAT THE ALTERNATOR IS AGAIN COVERED IN OIL.   BETWEEN THE 2 ISSUES, IT IS MOST LIKELY A MATTER OF DAYS (IF I'M LUCKY) BEFORE MY CAR LOSES POWER IN SOME FORM AND I AM POTENTIALLY IN A WRECK WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE DEALERSHIP WANTS TO \"RE-FIX\" THE FIRST 2 CAMPAIGNS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN FIXED, BUT FOR JUST THE VALVE GASKET WORK, IT WOULD BE AT LEAST $500, NOT INCLUDING THE ALTERNATOR THAT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED WHEN THE CAR DOES GO OUT. APPARENTLY THE GASKET THAT IS LEAKING THIS TIME ISN'T THE FRONT ONE, IT IS THE REAR ONE. MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS ON THIS ARE THAT IF THE FRONT ONE IS FAULTY, THEN IT'S NOT A STRETCH TO GET TO THE REAR ONE BEING FAULTY. MY HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP EVEN WARNED ME WHEN REPLACING THE FRONT ONE THAT MY REAR ONE WOULD MOST LIKELY NEED TO BE DONE TOO (FOR $500+). IF THE DEALERSHIPS KNOW, IT MAKES ME WONDER WHY THE RECALL DIDN'T INCLUDE BOTH VALVE COVER GASKETS OR A NEW ONE HASN'T BEEN ISSUED FOR THE REAR ONE.

I HAD FOUR OR FIVE SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH MY SANTA FE STARTING ON 4/21/15, WHICH LED TO SIGNIFICANT POWER LOSS AND SPEED LOSS OF THE CAR ON THE ROAD. THE FIRST TIME, I WAS DRIVING ON A LOCAL ROAD AT ~25 MPH. SUDDENLY I FELT THE CAR LOST THE POWER AND BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN. I STEPPED DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT THE CAR COULD NOT ACCELERATE (THE SPEED DROPPED TO ~10 MPH). I SAW 3 SYSTEM INDICATOR/WARNING LIGHTS ON: THE ESC OFF(ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL) AND CHECK ENGINE INDICATORS HAD A STEADY LIGHT AND THE AWD SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT WAS FLASHING. I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF THE CAR, WAITED ~1 MINUTE, AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON, BUT THE OTHER LIGHTS WENT OUT. THEN I DROVE THE CAR TO CONTINUE TO MY JOB. THE 2ND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON MY WAY HOME. THE SAME SCENARIO EXCEPT THAT I WAS DRIVING AT ~40 MPH AT THE TIME. THE SUDDEN POWER LOSS CAUSED THE CAR SPEED QUICKLY DROPPED TO ~10 MPH AND PROBABLY LED THE CAR BEHIND MINE TO MAKE A SUDDEN STOP TO AVOID A CRASH. AGAIN, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYING ON. THE OTHER TIMES I WAS ON THE CRESENT CITY CONNECTION (BRIDGE) IN THE CENTER LANE. I HAD TO WORK MY WAY OVER TWO LANES TO TURN THE VEHICLE OFF TO RESTART TO CONTINUE ON MY WAY TO OR FROM WORK. AFTER THE 5TH TIME, I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND AN ARTICLE STATING THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS ON THE TSB (TECHNICAL SAFETY BULLETIN). MAYBE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SHOULD BE AWARE OF MORE THAN ONE VEHICLE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.......",

SUDDENLY I FELT THE CAR LOST THE POWER AND BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN. I STEPPED DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT THE CAR COULD NOT ACCELERATE (THE SPEED DROPPED TO ~20 MPH). I SAW 3 SYSTEM INDICATOR/WARNING LIGHTS ON: THE ESC OFF(ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL) AND CHECK ENGINE INDICATORS HAD A STEADY LIGHT AND THE AWD SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT WAS FLASHING. I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF THE CAR, WAITED ~1 MINUTE, AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON, BUT THE OTHER LIGHTS WENT OUT. THEN I DROVE THE CAR TO CONTINUE MY GROCERY SHOPPING (SEVERAL STOPS, ~30 MILES IN TOTAL).    THE 2ND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON MY WAY HOME. THE SAME SCENARIO EXCEPT THAT I WAS DRIVING AT ~40 MPH AND GOING UPHILL AT THE TIME. THE SUDDEN POWER LOSS CAUSED THE CAR SPEED QUICKLY DROPPED TO ~10 MPH AND PROBABLY LED THE CAR BEHIND MINE TO MAKE A SUDDEN STOP TO AVOID A CRASH. AGAIN, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYING ON.

I HAVE CREATED CASE#[XXX] WITH HYUNDAI AMERICA --THEY HAVE RESPONDED THAT THEY WILL PASS ALONG THE INFORMATION TO ENGINEERING --BUT THEY HAVE NOTED THAT I WILL NOT BE CONTACTED BY HYUNDAI REGARDING DEPOSITION OF THE ISSUE. THE PROBLEM -- MY WIFE WEIGHS ABOUT 95 LBS.  SHE FREQUENTLY DOES NOT ACTIVATE THE AIR BAG SYSTEM ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. SHE IS ESSENTIALLY UNPROTECTED IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.  SHE JUST DOESN'T WEIGH ENOUGH TO RELIABLY ACTIVATE THE AIR BAG SYSTEM.   HYUNDAI SPENDS QUITE A FEW PAGES IN THEIR MANUAL TO COVER THEMSELVES LEGALLY.  THEY COMMENT THAT IF ALL ELSE FAILS JUST SIT IN THE BACK SEAT.  I WOULD IMAGINE FEW HUSBANDS AND WIVES OPT FOR THIS SOLUTION.  MOST CONSUMERS PROBABLY HAVEN'T READ THE MANUAL, IGNORE THE OFF SIGN OR DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, OR DON'T CARE AND RISK THE SAFETY OF THEIR PASSENGER.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  THE SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SEAT SHOULD ACTIVATE THE AIR BAG SYSTEM FOR SAY ANYONE OVER 66 LBS.  I BELIEVE ANOTHER MANUFACTURER HAS RECENTLY DONE SO.  IT IS STUPID THAT I HAVE WAITED THIS LONG TO COMPLAIN -- BUT I KEPT THINKING THEIR WOULD EVENTUALLY BE A RECALL AND I NORMALLY JUST DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS.

I'VE SPOKEN ON A FEW OCCASIONS WITH THE CEO[XXX], AND CORRESPONDED WITH HIM AS WELL VIA EMAIL AFTER GETTING NO SATISFACTION/HELP FROM THE REGIONAL PERSON.  THE CEO'S WIFE GREW UP IN MY AREA (LAKE OSWEGO, OR.) AND THAT IS WHY HE CALLED ME PERSONALLY.  HOWEVER, THE BOTTOM LINE WAS NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF THIS CALL.  HE OFFERED ME THE FOLLOWING: HE OFFERED TO EXCHANGE MY VEHICLE WHICH HAD ABOUT 8,000 MILES ON IT BY THE TIME HE GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME FOR A NEW 2009 SONATA FWD AND IT WAS THE OLD MODEL AS HYUNDAI WAS COMING OUT WITH A TOTALLY REVAMPED 2010 SONATA MODEL.  I BOUGHT MY SANTA FE AWD  BECAUSE I WANTED A SUV WITH AWD!  IF I WANTED A SEDAN, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE!  I BEGGED HIM TO GIVE ME ANOTHER COMPARABLY EQUIPPED SANTA FE AS THEY COULD FIND NO REASON MECHANICALLY WHY MY MILEAGE WAS SO LOW AND I ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK IT MANUALLY IN ADDITION TO THE COMPUTER OUTPUT.  SO, I REFUSED TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER AND I SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT ON GAS AND I LIVE ON A SMALL FIXED INCOME AND CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY ANOTHER SANTA FE!  OTHERS I'VE QUESTIONED WITH THE SAME VEHICLE AND EQUIPPED COMPARABLY GET 20 MPG OR MORE CITY DRIVING. READING HYUNDAI HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT SO MANY ISSUES BROUGHT UP IS ABOMINABLE.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SO LIVES AREN'T LOST AND PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING AT ALMOST $4/GALLON FOR ALL THIS GAS I HAVE TO KEEP BUYING IN MY CASE.  THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING MAJOR WRONG WITH MY ENGINE OR SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS ME FROM GETTING THE MILEAGE I SHOULD.  AS I SAID, I AM A VERY CONSERVATIVE DRIVER.

THE VEHILCE WAS TOWED TO THE CLOSEST DEALER AND TO MY SURPRISE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF 2 TSBS (TSB09-FL-003-2, TSB-10-FL-010)(NHTSA ITEM NUMBERS: 10032793,10034649) THAT WERE EXISTING ON THIS VEHICLE THAT CAN CAUSE THIS FAILURE. I SERIOUSLY THINK THAT THIS KIND OF FAILURE SHOULD BE A RECALL RATHER THAN JUST A TSB IF IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE TO PREVENT POSSIBLE CRASHES IN THE FUTURE.  *TR",

EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAR IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:  THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR DOES NOT DETECT ME AS AN ADULT AND TOGGLES ON AND OFF AT WILL.  IT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING TO BE BARRELING DOWN THE ROAD AND REALIZE THAT I HAVE NO AIRBAG.  I HAVE READ THAT THE SENSOR IS SET AT ABOUT 120LBS AND I WEIGH 115LBS.  THE ARROGANT SERVICE PERSON AT HYUNDAI RECOMMENDED THAT I BE THE DRIVER OR SIT IN THE REAR SEAT!  I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD JUST TELL A 48 YEAR OLD WOMAN TO SIT IN THE BACK!  (THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING GOING ON DATES WITH THE HUBBY OR HELPING MY 15 YEAR OLD LEARN TO DRIVE.)  THE SERVICE PERSON ALSO ASKED ME IF I WAS SITTING SQUARELY ON THE SEAT WITH MY LEGS EXTENDED.  WHAT?  YES, I WAS SITTING SQUARELY ON THE SEAT WITH LEGS EXTENDED!!  SO,  IF I SHIFT MY BUTT SLIGHTLY ON A 4 HOUR DRIVE - ARE THEY SAYING I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AIRBAG NOT DEPLOYING?  WHAT RIDICULOUSNESS.  I WAS APPALLED.  I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT MANY PETITE PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THE SANTA FE AND THE SONATA.  THIS IS NOT AN UNKNOWN OR RARE PROBLEM.  I AM TAKING IT IN TO HYUNDAI SERVICE ON MONDAY, BUT QUITE FRANKLY, I WAS NOT ENCOURAGED BY THE QUESTIONS THE SERVICE PEOPLE ASKED.  IF IT CAN'T BE FIXED TO BE ARMED AT ALL TIMES, I WILL RETURN THE CAR - AND THAT WOULD BE A SHAME BECAUSE WE LIKED EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT.  *TR",

I WAS SLOWING DOWN, WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWO CAR LENGTHS FROM THE NEXT VEHICLE I APPLIED THE BRAKE IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO FLOOR. I PUMPED THE BRAKE SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE WHEEL TOWARD THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO GO IN A DITCH WHEN THE BRAKE FINALLY ENGAGED AND I STOPPED.  I SLOWLY DROVE INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT. TESTED THE BRAKES AND CONTINUED TO MY SISTERS.  FOUR HOURS LATER WE WERE DRIVING HOME. STILL CAUTIOUS AND LEAVING ROOM BETWEEN ME AND OTHER CARS. I WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED. THE BRAKE LET GO AND MY CAR SHOT FORWARD. LUCKILY I HIT THE BRAKE AGAIN AND IT CAUGHT. MY SON AND I BOTH WERE PULLED BACK AND HIT THE SEATS BY THE SEAT BELTS. I DROVE THE FEW BLOCKS HOME AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK THE NEXT MORNING. MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER SINCE.
