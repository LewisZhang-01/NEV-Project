JUST TOOK IN AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE LEFT SIDE TIMING BELT AND $6,100 TO FIX.  WHAT TROUBLES ME IS THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE SAME YEAR AUDI BUT ONLY FOR THE 2.0.  MY CAR IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY 3.2 LITER HAVING THIS ISSUE.  NO RECALL?  IT OCCURRED AT THE SAME MOMENT IN TIME, AROUND 65,000 MILES.  WHILE I WAS APPEASED SLIGHTLY BY THEM OFFERING TO FIX IT FOR PARTS COST..... ABOUT $3,300, AND THE SUBSEQUENT BILL WAS A SURPRISING (TO THE GOOD) BILL OF $2327.25 INCLUDING THE NECESSARY OIL CHANGE, I JUST QUESTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO PENDING RECALL ON THE AUDI Q5 3.2 LITER.  AND UNFORTUNATELY STILL A SUSPICIOUS COST.  EVERYTHING WAS DONE AMICABLY, AS TIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE.  BUT STILL FEEL SHORTED THAT MY 3.2 DOESN'T FALL INTO THIS RECALL.",

WE KNEW THE FUEL INJECTORS WERE GOING BAD BECAUSE OF THE WIRING WHICH WAS NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED FOR THE FUEL PUMP WHICH CAUSED THE ALTERNATOR ALSO TO GO BAD AND THE SENSORS AND NOT TO FORGET ABOUT THE SPARK PLUGS AND COILS. WE THOUGHT WE FINALLY WERE GOING TO GET OUR CAR FIXED AT NO CHARGE TO US EVEN THOUGH WE  I KNEW THAT OUR WARRANTEE WAS OUTDATED, BUT WE THOUGHT MAYBE SINCE THE RECALL HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT AUDI WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

THE ENGINE HAS LEAKED OIL THE ENTIRE TIME.  3 YEARS AGO AUDI REPLACED THE PISTONS DUE TO A DESIGN DEFECT (THEY PAID FOR IT).  4 DAYS BEFORE MY REGULARLY SCHEDULED SERVICE APPOINTMENT MY ENGINE DIED WHILE DRIVING IT HOME FROM WORK THROUGH A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

WHEN I GOT IT INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND TURNED IT OFF IT WOULD NOT RESTART.  AFTER 4-5 ATTEMPTS, THE ENGINE WOULD NOT TURNOVER.  SO I HAD TO TOW MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ASSESSMENT.

IT SEEMS THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS SINCE TAKATA WILL BE LIABLE IF I DIE IN AN ACCIDENT.  HOWEVER, I HOLD AUDI AND THE NHTSA RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT ANYONE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT CARS A FEW YEARS AGO SINCE THE EXISTING SUPPLY OF GOOD AIRBAGS IS GOING INTO NEW CARS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SOLD YET.    I ALSO FIND IT ODD THAT IN THE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION REPORT ON YOUR WEBSITE, THERE IS NO DATA AT ALL FOR AUDI, WHICH MAKES ME THINK AUDI HAS DONE NOTHING TO EXPEDITE THIS RECALL WHILE ALL OF THEIR COMPETITORS HAVE.  WHY DOES THE NHTSA ALLOW THIS?  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND RESPOND, I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.  I NOW HAVE TWO RECALLS FOR MY 2011 Q5, THE TAKATA AIRBAG AND NOW THE FUEL PUMP THAT COULD BLOW UP.
