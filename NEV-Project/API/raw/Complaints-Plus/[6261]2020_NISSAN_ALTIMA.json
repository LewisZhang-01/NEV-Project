When dirt and dust are on the windshield and you want to spray it off is when the problem arises. The fluid is only sprayed on the lower portion of the windshield and does not spray the part that needs sprayed the middle and top where you look out off. This is not only a hindrance but could be a safety issue when your visual path is compromised. The dealer said they were putting in complaints and hopefully the engineers or design team looks at it as a problem. I hope this grabs the attention of the people that can make safety issues known and hopefully something is put in the motion to fix this. Thanks",

First it was on the passenger's side which I originally assumed that something/somebody must have hit it while parked at my child's school.  I took it to AAA Glass to get an estimate and was told that that usually a windshield does not do that unless it is 3 years old.  My car is a 2020!!!  Then my car was parked in my driveway all weekend and when I got in it, I noticed that the driver's windshield area was cracked.  Finding this VERY usual, I did a google check to discover that several drivers have had the SAME problem with the SAME year, SAME model and SAME make of the car.  A YouTube video of their car even showed it is the SAME area that I experience the crack.  I called the dealership and was told there wasn't a recall and they offered no assistance.  I called Nissan and am waiting on them to return my car.  With so many people having this issue, it is worrisome.  This is a safety issue and a recall should be done immediately to avoid any accidents or injury/harm to those that sit in the front seat.  I am not getting anywhere and hope that this complaint and others are taken seriously.  Thank you!",
