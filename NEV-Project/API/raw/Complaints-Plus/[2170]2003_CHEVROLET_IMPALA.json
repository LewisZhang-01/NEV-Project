        "summary": "Traveling at 58 mph in Cruise Control for 10 minutes I increased speed with 4-6 rapid pushes of the Accelerate button in less than 1.5 seconds, Each push is 1 mph. I have never pushed it that rapidly.The engine acted as if I floored the accelerator & the transmission went from 4th to 3rd gear, speed went to 70+ and rapidly increasing. I stepped on the break pedal several times to disable CC but no help, I switched the CC button to the off position several times, no help. Now at 85+ and accelerating hard in wide open throttle (WOT). I shift to Neutral and turned the ignition to the ACC position to retain steering ability as the engine was RPM'ing out to destruction. I coasted off the highway and set ignition to off. After a few minutes I turned engine on and it rev'd out of control, still WOT. Ignition off did not reset the problem. I opened the hood to disconnected the battery & I observe that neither the CC or accelerator cables are not holding the throttle body (TB) in \"WOT\", it was closed in an idle position. It is not mechanical. I disconnected the battery for several minutes and then the system operated normally. I have used CC a million times but never have pushed that accel button that fast. I served 7 years as a Reactor Operation onboard US navy Fast attack Submarines, have torn apart and assemble mechanical and electrical reactor systems. I have been a Hardware Engineer for 40+ yrs and have 10 US patents in fault tolerant server design. I've been a car guy since 5 yrs old. This is a problem with the cars computer or its code. The rapid pushing of the CC accel button is key here as well as memory retaining this CC state after Key OFF. Its a good thing I experienced with many hard casualty life and death situations while serving, because my car was accelerating out of control, my experience and training in the US Military taught me to keep cool and think.You really should investigate this. I can tell you more specifics but I'm character limited.",

I HAD MY BATTERY, ALTERNATOR & STARTER CHECKED, AND IT WAS GOOD. THE COMPANY I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM PROVIDED WARRANTY COVERAGE ON THE VEHICLE. I TOOK THE CAR TO GET SERVICED IN THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER FOR AN ENGINE MOUNT REPLACEMENT. THEY REPLACED MY ENGINE MOUNTS AND FUEL PUMP. 2 DAYS AFTER THAT SERVICE I STARTED HAVING ISSUES STARTING THE CAR. WHEN YOU PUT THE KEY IN YOU USUALLY HEAR BEEPING NOISE AND I DIDN'T. THAN MY BATTERY LIGHT, ABS LIGHT, TRAC OFF LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON AND IN THE MESSAGE CENTER TRACKING SYSTEM LIGHT CAME UP. THIS WAS VERY INCONVENIENT DUE TO THE WEATHER AND HAVING TO GET 2 TODDLERS READY FOR SCHOOL IN THE AM. I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND HE REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH. I DIDN'T TAKE IT BACK TO THE SAME PLACE BECAUSE EVERYTIME YOU TAKE IT FOR SERVICE MY DEDUCTIBLE IS $100. AFTER 2 WEEKS AFTER REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN. SO I CALLED MY WARRANTY SERVICE CENTER THEY SAID TO BRING IT BACK BUT IF IT NEEDS FIXING I HAVE TO PAY AGAIN. (ALSO I AM PAYING A CAR NOTE OF $115 A WEEK). I REFUSE TO KEEP PAYING MONEY FOR THIS PROBLEM. THIS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS IN SO MANY WAYS. IT'S VERY FUSTRATING BECAUSE I TRADER MY PREVIOUS CAR (2000 BUICK REGAL) IN FOR THE SAME REASON. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A WIRING ISSUE, SENSOR ISSUE OR MAYBE WHEN THEY CHANGED MY ENGINE MOUNTS OR FUEL PUMP SOMETHING GOT DISCONNECTED. THIS PROBLEM DIDN'T START UNTIL THEY DID SERVICE ON MY VEHICLE.

WHEN I WENT TO GET INTO THE CAR IN THE MORNING I COULD NOT TURN THE KEY. AT 8 AM I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND HE STATED THAT I SHOULD BRING IT BACK AND THEY WOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG. I BROUGHT IT IN WEDNESDAY EVENING AFTER WORK, THURSDAY MORNING I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER TELLING ME THAT THE RECALL HAD NO EFFECT ON MY CAR THAT I NEEDED A NEW TUMBLER NOW. I PICKED THE CAR UP THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE SALES LADY THAT DROVE IT AROUND SAID THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO START THAT SHE HAD TO GET A MECHNIC TO START IT. I FOUND THE GENERAL MANAGER AND ASKED HIM TO REVERSE THE RECALL BY POPPING THE COVER OFF THE KEY. HE DID AND THE CAR STARTED WITH ONLY A SMALL GRIB TROUBLE FROM THE TUMBLER WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY THE NUMBER OF FORCED STARTS AFTER THE KEY COVER WAS PLACED ON THE KEY. AFTER INSPECTION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE COVER FROM THE RECALL WAS PREVENTING MY KEY FROM GOING IN ALL THAT WAY TO THE TUMBLER TO START THE CAR. I AM ASKING THAT THE TUMBLER BE REPLACED AND A NEW SET OF KEYS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO MY KEY AND THE RECALL NOT BEING EFFECTIVE WITHOUT DAMAGE TO MY TUMBLER.

I ALSO HAD BRUISES ON MY HAND, KNEE, AND RIGHT BREAST.  IN ADDITION TO THESE I ALSO HAD SOME LE FRANC FRACTURES TO MY LEFT FOOT WHICH I REQUIRED SURGERY FOR.

THE TRACTION CONTROL DOESN'T WORK BUT WILL RANDOMLY KICK IN WHILE DRIVING AND THE CAR INSTANTLY FEELS AS IF THE BRAKES ARE BEING APPLIED AND GRINDER BUT THE WORSE PART IS HOW THE PULLING TO ONE SIDE BECOMES A QUICK GRAB AND JERK TO ONE SIDE AND HAS NEARLY CAUSED ME SEVERAL ACCIDENTS AND I CANNOT RELAX AND DRIVE. I AM ALWAYS TENSE AND READY TO FIGHT TO KEEP MY CAR GOING STRAIGHT AND NOW WITH THE BAD MICHIGAN WINTER ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE ON SOME DAYS. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I NEED A NEW TRACTION CONTROL PUMP WHICH IS GOING TO COST AROUND $2500 AND UP DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY FIND BUT WILL AUTOMATICALLY START AT $2500. THAT COST IS RIDICULOUS AND I HAVE TALKED TO PROB APPROX A HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO EITHER HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OR KNEW OF SOMEONE WHO DOES, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. MY CAR IS NOW PARKED AND I HAVE TO BEG FOR RIDES TO WORK BECAUSE ITS WINTER AND I CANNOT PUT MYSELF AND OTHERS IN DANGER WITH THIS ISSUE. I HAVE TO WORK AND TRANSPORT KIDS TO DIFFERENT EVENTS AND FEEL THAT THIS PART HAS TO BE DEFECTIVE FROM THE START IF THERE'S THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE.

MY BATTERY IN TIME WOULD BE DEAD.  PERHAPS WORSE, MY CAR WAS JUST SITTING THERE WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNISTIC THIEF. I SEARCHED ONLINE FOR HELP AND FOUND SCORES OF REPORTS OF IMPALA OWNERS WHO HAD  THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM.  THE IGNITION KEY GETS STUCK IN ACC AND CAN'T BE REMOVED.  IT'S AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SECURE YOUR CAR.  NOT TO MENTION THAT YOU CAN'T TURN THE ACCESSORIES OFF, SO YOU HAVE A GUARANTEED DRAINED BATTERY.  HERE IS JUST ONE FORUM WHERE THIS SPECIFIC IMPALA PROBLEM WAS DISCUSSED: HTTP://REPAIRPAL.COM/IGNITION-KEY-STUCK-DUE-TO-FAILED-SHIFTER-020.  CHEVROLET SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.  THERE'S NO WAY ONE CAN FORCE THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION, AND THE ONLY MEANS OF AVOIDING THE DRAINED-BATTERY PROBLEM IS TO REMOVE THE BATTERY CABLES.  THAT'S NOT TECHNOLOGY, THAT'S A NIGHTMARE.  MY CAR IS CONSTANTLY AT RISK OF BEING STOLEN, AND I'M HOOKING AND UNHOOKING THE BATTERY CABLES ALL THE TIME.  THIS IS A VERY PERVASIVE AND PERSISTENT PROBLEM WITH IMPALA OWNERS.

I TOOK MY CARE TO GM SERVICE AND THEY SAID IT CAR NEED TO CHANGE SOME ELECTRICAL PARTS LIKE BCM COMPUTER, IGNITION KEY SET, ETC ETC  WILL COST ME AROUND $850     AFTER MY RESEARCH ONLINE DISCOVERED THAT GM KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE IN THEIR SYSTEM, BUT DOES NOT CARE TO FIX IT.    IN THIS ECONOMY, NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE A 850 DOLLAR ERROR. IT IS DISHEARTENING. THE REASON WE WENT WITH A CHEVY IMPALA IS THE DEPENDABILITY. I CANNOT AFFORD THIS ISSUE AND IT IS SIMPLY CARELESS ON GM'S PART. I'M A VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER AND I WILL SPREAD THE WORD AROUND TO NOT PURCHASE GM VEHICLES.  *TR",

MY CHEVROLET TAHOE HAS BOTH THESE ISSUES.  THEY STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE LETTER.  WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE FROM GENERAL MOTORS IS WHY MY SAFETY IS NOT AN CONCERN TO THEM BECAUSE I HAVE DRIVEN MORE THAN 70,000 MILES IN MY TAHOE?  I TRAVEL THROUGH A LOT OF RURAL AREAS TO WORK AND I FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT RUN OUT OF GAS.  I FEEL IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  THE SPEEDOMETER REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING 60 OR 70 MILES PER HOUR WHEN I AM SITTING AT A RED LIGHT.  WHEN I AM GOING DOWN THE ROAD IT REGISTERS THAT I AM GOING OVER 120 MILES PER HOUR.  THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING.  NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL FOR SPEEDING TICKETS.  I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT GENERAL MOTORS CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY MILES THEY HAVE DRIVEN.   THESE GAUGES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE REPLACED AND THEY ARE A SAFETY HAZARD.  NOT BEING ABLE TO MONITOR YOUR RATE OF SPEED OR BE AWARE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH GAS TO GET HOME ARE SAFETY ISSUES TO ME FOR MY HEALTH AS WELL AS MY PEACE OF MIND AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY GENERAL MOTORS DOESN'T FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECTING THIS DEFAULT THEY ARE AWARE FOR ALL THEIR TAHOE OWNERS.

THEY SAID THAT RENTAL CAR REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE MADE IF WARRANTY REPAIR WAS APPROVED. WE PAID A DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND PICKED UP OUR CAR AND THEN TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH FOR YEARS AND PAID FOR THE REPAIR OURSELVES.

I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND MY APARTMENT IS ON THE BEACH SO I PARK CLOSE TO THE OCEAN ABOUT 8 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR.     THE FIRST PROBLEM OCCURRED AT 6,289 MILES WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED THERE WAS A VIBRATION OR GRABBING FEELING UNLIKE NORMAL SMOOTH BRAKING. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO QUIRK CHEVROLET IN QUINCY, MA ON AUG 16, 2004.  THE TECHNICIAN SAID THE BRAKES WERE RUSTED OR PITTED AND NEEDED TO BE GROUND DOWN OR REPLACED (SEE COPY OF WORK ORDER FROM QUIRK ATTACHED).  I ASKED HIM HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE BRAKE MECHANISM IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR AND NOT PROTECTED IN ANY WAY, SO THAT THE SALT AIR FROM THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE PITTING IN THE BRAKES.     THE SECOND PROBLEM OCCURRED AT 11,225 MILES WHEN THE SAME FEELING IN BRAKING WAS EXPERIENCED BY THE DRIVER.  AGAIN I TOOK THE CAR FOR REPAIR AT QUIRK AND THEY REPORTED ''INSPECTED AND FOUND THE FRONT AND REAR BRAKES RUSTED BADLY, REMOVED AND REPLACED THE FRONT AND REAR BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS. THE COST ABOUT $725!      PS: I TALKED WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE, VIKIE SMITH AT 1 800 222 1020 REGARDING THIS MATTER ON THIS DATE AND SHE STARTED A FILE OR REPORT IN THE COMPUTER AT THAT TIME. HER DIRECT LINE IS 866 932 4368 EXT 35336, FILE NUMBER [XXX].  ON THIS DATE WE HAD A CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE QUIRK SERVICE DEPT AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM WITH MY BRAKES IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I LIVE ON THE BEACH AND I DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR ENOUGH TO KEEP THE RUST FROM BUILDING UP ON THE BRAKES.  *NM   UPDATED 07/19/2012  *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

I ADVISED GM THAT THERE WERE OTHER REPORTS TO NHTSA ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH CHEVROLET IMPALAS.  I REQUESTED THAT AN INVESTIGATION AND POSSIBLE RECALL SHOULD BE INITIATED AND ASKED FOR A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT OF MY VEHICLE. THIS WAS DENIED \"AS THERE WERE TOO FEW EPISODES TO WARRANT THIS ACTION\" AND MY CAR\" WAS REPAIRED PER WARRANTY OBLIGATION OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION\".
