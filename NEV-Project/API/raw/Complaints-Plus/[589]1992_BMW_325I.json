I PULLED OVER AND OPENED THE HOOD ONLY TO BE SPRAYED WITH THE REMNANTS OF THIS FLUID AS IT GOT ON THE FAN. I JUMPED BACK AND AVOIDED ANY INJURY. THE HOSE LEADING FROM THE TOP OF THE RADIATOR TO THE ENGINE BLOCK HAD FALLEN OFF! THAT SHOULD BE SIMPLE TO FIX! ON CLOSER INSPECTION, THE RADIATOR ATTACHMENTS HAD COMPLETELY FRACTURED OFF! THE FRACTURED PORTION WAS STUCK IN THE HOSE! AND THE REMNANT ON THE RADIATOR IS TOO SHORT TO SECURELY ANCHOR THE HOSE TO THE RADIATOR AFTER REMOVING THE BROKEN PART FROM INSIDE THE HOSE. HOWEVER, I USE IT THIS WAY AND KEEP A SUPPLY OF WATER IN THE CAB FOR SHORT TRIPS.THE FRACTURED RADIATOR WAS CHRONICALLY LEAKING AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WINTERS THERE WOULD BE A MIST ON MY WINDSHIELD THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF. WIPING WITH TISSUE WOULD LEAVE A STEAK MOST OF THE TIME! I NOTE THAT BMW HAS RECENTLY RECALLED THE RADIATOR CAP ON THIS VEHICLE. FROM THIS EXPERIENCE I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT HIGH PRESSURES DID NOT CAUSE THE HOSE TO RUPTURE BUT A DEFECTIVE RADIATOR THAT IS SUBJECT TO FRACTURE AT THE POINT OF HOSE CONNECTION RESULTING IN CHRONIC LEAKS PARTICULAR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND WORKING PREASURES LEADING TO MIST AND FROM THE COOLANT WITHIN THE VEHICLE AND POOR VISIBILITY. TURNING THE WINDCHIELD DEFOGGER ON DOES NOT CLEAR THIS PROBLEM BUT ADDS TO IT! BMW NEED TO RECALL THESE DEFECTIVE RADIATORS BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF THIRD DEGREE BURNS AND DEATH AS WELL AS UNSAFE DRIVING FROM THE CONSTANT FOGGING OF THE WINDSHIELD.

UPON RETURNING TO THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA, I TOOK THE CAR TO A REPAIR SHOP AND WAS TOLD THAT THE WATER PUMP HAD FAILED DUE TO THE BREAKAGE OF THE IMPELLER.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM IN THIS VINTAGE OF BMW SINCE THE MANUFACTURER HAD USED A PLASTIC IMPELLER IN THE WATER PUMP, RATHER THAN A METAL IMPELLER AS IS USUAL IN OTHER MODELS.  THE MECHANIC RELATED THAT HE HAD PERFORMED ABOUT 25-30 IDENTICAL REPAIRS ON BMWS AND THAT THE PROBLEM WAS ALWAYS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PLASTIC IMPELLER.  I HAVE HAD THE WATER PUMP REPLACED WITH ANOTHER PUMP WITH A METAL IMPELLER, BUT THE EVENT COST ME $458 IN REPAIRS AND APPROXIMATELY $265 FOR A RENTAL CAR FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP, AS WELL AS ABOUT $150 IN UNNECESSARY HOTEL BILLS.  I PLAN TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER TO REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT OF THESE COSTS, AS I FEEL THAT THE USE OF A PLASTIC IMPELLER OVER A METAL ONE IS A DEFECTIVE AND NEGLIGENT DESIGN.  I STILL HAVE THE OLD WATER PUMP AND THE PLASTIC IMPELLER IN MY POSSESSION.",
