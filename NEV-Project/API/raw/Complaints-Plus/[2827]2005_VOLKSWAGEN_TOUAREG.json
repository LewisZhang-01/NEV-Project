BASED UPON MY CONCERN AS A SAFETY AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, AND MY REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AND FILES AVAILABLE FROM NHTSA CONCERNING THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THIS PROBLEM IN 2006, I BELIEVE THAT VWS FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY NHTSA FOR CONSIDERATION OF REOPENING OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

THE TOUAREG SERVICE PACK/CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CAMPAIGN IN LATE DECEMBER 2006 WHERE VVV REPLACED THE SUBJECT DEFECTIVE HARNESSES AT NO EXPENSE TO TOUAREG OWNERS WAS AN ACTION TAKEN AT THAT TIME TO AVOID A RECALL.

THE SEAT WOULD NOT WORK AT FIRST, THEN IT GOT HOT, AND HOTTER, AND STARTED BURNING HER.  SHE CUT OFF THE HEAT SWITCH FOR THE SEAT, AND THE SEAT REMAINED HOT. THE SWITCH STARTED GETTING TOO HOT TO TOUCH AND SMELLED OF SMOKE, SO WE TURNED AROUND AND BROUGHT THE CAR BACK THAT SAME DAY/MINUTE.  THE DEALER SAID IT WAS JUST THE SWITCH.

THE NEXT DAY, THE HEATED SEAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.  OUR THIRD DAY OF OWNERSHIP, WE HAD TO SCHEDULE A SERVICE FOR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND DO WITHOUT THE HEATED SEAT ALL TOGETHER.  THE VW SERVICE ADVISOR ADVISED ME HE MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE THE HEATING ELEMENT IN THE SEAT ITSELF  ALTHOUGH HE COMMENTED \"HE KNEW NOTHING OF SUCH PROBLEMS AS THIS\"-?.  ANYWAY, HERE WE SIT WITH A LOANER AWAITING THE VERDICT, AND IT APPEARS WE MIGHT BE INHERITING A PROBLEM FROM WAY BACK.
