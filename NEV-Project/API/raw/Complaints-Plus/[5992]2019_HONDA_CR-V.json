The very strong motion jerked me so that both of my wrists and my neck are now hurting.  I am now very nervous about driving my vehicle; and, especially having passengers with me.

On March 3, 2022, I was driving on a highway at 65 miles per hour when the Forward Collision Warning and Braking system unexpectedly activated for no apparent reasons.  I had reported earlier incidents of this erroneous activation to a Dean Honda service representative who attributed the cause to interference with sensors such as snow on vehicles.  I want to emphasize the following conditions at the time of the March 3 erroneous activation: (1) my car was the only car on the road, no vehicles were in front, beside or behind; (2) the road was straight; (3) no overpasses, (4) no objects or structures on both sides of the road and (5) the windshield in the vicinity of the camera, and the hood and front grill in the vicinity of the radar were clean.  As a result, I do not believe that the March 3 incident was attributed to sensor interference as Dean Honda claimed.  On March 14, 2022, Dean Honda took possession of my vehicle for less than an hour and again claimed reflection could be the cause of the March 3 incidents.  Dean Honda is located at 911 Clairton Blvd., Pittsburgh, PA 15236.  Phone no. 412-552-3228.",

For example, I was traveling southbound of Delaware Rt1 near Milton DE just over a week ago.  This road has two lanes running in either direction.  I had been in the right lane and saw some vehicles ahead moving at least 20 miles per hour under the speed limit.  I switched to the left lane, which was clear for at least 1/4 mile ahead.  As I approached to where the vehicles were, my car slammed the brakes on and decelerated quickly.  I was nearly rear-ended by a truck coming up behind me.  This same type of thing has happened on curves in the past and it just seems that the system is misinterpreting the road conditions.",

The third incident the automatic braking activated for just a split second and went off when there was a vehicle at least 50 feet in front of my vehicle and we were traveling straight down a city road at less than 30 miles per hour.

The consumer reports article from 2018 stated the 2019 model was to include a \"fix\" for this problem but it has not. My car has been in the shop twice in 2 weeks for this issue and now I am facing a $1,788.00 repair at my cost to have all new fuel injectors replaced at 51,400 miles.  First sign of problem showed every safety system on the car failing and warnings on every light on the dash.  Only after the 2nd trip to the dealer was the fuel injection code thrown on the computer.  This problem leads to stalls, cuts offs, sluggishness in traffic which all cause safety issues. 2. The automatic emergency braking system on my car has alerted on multiple occasions when there is nothing in front of me, no obstruction, or any reason to throw the brake warning on the screen.  There is one particular place on my daily commute where this happens consistently even though the light is green and there is no traffic flow ahead, beside or oncoming. 3. The lane keep assist program misreads shadows from the electric or telephone lines projected onto the roadway and steers to maneuver around them.  It also tends to have difficulty when the road is wet in spots from rain earlier in the day.  I keep it off most of the time now because of how it reacts.",

        "summary": "Overview: On July 4, 2020 my SUV rolled backwards on a slight incline when the start button was pressed to turn it off while in drive position causing a broken ankle, multiple abrasions and back pain. Details:  I drove my SUV onto a driveway with a slight incline.  The SUV did not roll forward because of the incline but after stepping out of the vehicle I realized that I had not turned it off. I turned back around while standing next to the SUV and pressed the button to turn it off not realizing the car was in drive.  It immediately started rolling backwards (downhill), knocking me to the ground and dragging me since I was caught under the door.      The driver's side wheel either went over my foot or dragged it (not sure which since at that point I was afraid for my life).  It broke my ankle and tore away the skin in the ankle area.  When it finally stopped, I was able to roll away and cry for help.      This incident caused a broken ankle, multiple abrasions on my body and damage to the muscles in my back causing a very painful rib cage.  These injuries required immediate and ongoing physician care and physical therapy.      I truly believe that there should be a safety feature that does NOT allow us to turn the car off while the vehicle is in drive.  It was something that was part of the older key start/stop vehicles.  I believe that I read that some of the other manufacturers were dealing with this problem so don't know why Honda hasn't addressed it.  Why is it not standard on all the new keyless push button vehicles?  I know I'm not the only one who had this problem because my orthopedic doctor told me another of her patients sustained injuries with a roll back.   Thank you for your time.",

THE REPORTED ISSUES ARE HIGH ENGINE NOISE, SLUGGISH ACCELERATION, STEERING WHEEL TIGHT AND BRAKE PEDAL FEELS VERY LOW WHILE APPLYING BRAKE.  HONDA DEALERS DID NOT ACCEPT THE MAIN ISSUE WHILE IS HIGH ENGINE NOISE AND SLUGGISH ACCELERATION. THEY SIMPLY DENY SAYING NO ALERTS SHOWING ON THE DASHBOARD.   RAISED SUPPORT CASES (GIVEN BELOW) WITH AMERICAN HONDA AND I FEEL I DID NOT GET RIGHT SUPPORT BECAUSE AMERICAN HONDA SAYS WE VALUE OUR CUSTOMERS BUT THEY SAY OUR AUTHORIZED DEALER SHOULD CHECK AND CONFIRM ON THE CAR ISSUE.

AS A THIRD PARTY REVIEW, I APPROACHED FIRESTONE, AUSTIN FOR INSPECTION THEY DID A TEST RIDE AND CONFIRMED WITH A REPORT ON THE ISSUES SLUGGISH ACCELERATION AND STEERING HARDNESS.   BUT AMERICAN HONDA DENIED FIRESTONE INSPECTION REPORT AS THEY BELIEVE ONLY AUTHORIZED DEALER, WHO ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE ISSUES.

I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM SINCE IT HAD BEEN REPORTED WITH THE 2017-2018 MODELS WITH THE SAME 1.5 TURBO ENGINE.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER'S ATTENTION BEFORE WE BOUGHT THE CAR AND WE WERE TOLD THAT HONDA HAD \"FIXED THE PROBLEM AND THAT OUR VEHICLE HAD THE FIX\".  WE WERE PLANNING A TRIP TO DALLAS, TX ON 02/22/20 AND PLANED TO DRIVE THERE FROM OUR HOME IN DULUTH, MN.  IN PREPARING FOR THE TRIP, I CHECKED THE ENGINE OIL AND FOUND THAT THE OIL LEVEL WAS 1/2\" ABOVE THE FULL MARK ON THE DIPSTICK, AND THE OIL WAS DARK AND SMELLED STRONGLY OF GASOLINE.  THE CAR HAD 2407 MILES ON IT AT THIS TIME AND OBVIOUSLY HONDA HAD NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ON 02/21/20 WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND HAD THEM CHECK THE OIL.  THEY OBSERVED THE SAME ISSUES THAT I AM REPORTING.  THEY STATED THAT HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT HAS NOT YET ISSUED A RECALL. BUT THEY ALSO STATED THAT HONDA WAS NOT PROVIDING ANY EXPLANATION OR REMEDY OTHER THAN TO CHANGE THE OIL AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE.  MY DEALERSHIP, TO THEIR CREDIT, AGREED TO CHANGE THE OIL AND FILTER AT NO CHARGE TO ME.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ALSO EXPLAINED WHY THE ISSUE IS OCCURRING AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HONDA MAY YET BE FORCED TO ISSUE A RECALL.  HONDA HAS ALREADY OFFERED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE 2017-18 MODELS AS THE RESULT OF A CLASS ACTION SUIT, BUT NOTHING IS BEING DONE FOR THE 2019 OR 2020 MODELS THAT HAVE THE SAME ENGINE AND SAME PROBLEM.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT PREMATURE ENGINE WEAR, DAMAGE, OR POTENTIAL OF FIRE OR EXPLOSION.  DEALER REPAIR #122992, KRENZEN HONDA DULUTH, MN.",
