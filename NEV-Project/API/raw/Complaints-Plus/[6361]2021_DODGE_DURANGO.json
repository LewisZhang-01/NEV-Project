The problem has been demonstrated over and over again at two different dodge service centers. It has been replicated by technicians in the field. FCA Corporate is aware of my complaint. The field representative said this is normal.  If this was a child\u2019s hand or an animal\u2019s paw, it would be crushed, until it stalls. The owners manual clearly states if anything obstructs the powerlift gate while it\u2019s closing or opening the liftgate will automatically reverse to the closed or open position after multiple obstructions in the same cycle to liftgate will automatically stop and must be opened or closed manually. This happens on the first attempt not multiple attempts. There is nothing in the owners manual warning customers about this safety hazard. I am not excepting the answer this is operating as designed. This needs a full investigation and should be a recall on all dodge vehicles which my understanding is manufactured after 2011 until present, according to service manager.  This can be duplicated using towels rolled up, cargo liner sticking out of trunk, or other objects like a beach chair bag is how we discovered it.  Furthermore, if in a parking lot or at home and you are going into store/home it looks liked it\u2019s latch. Your vehicle is liftgate is unlatched!   You do get a warning message on dash obstruction detected, but the liftgate fails to recoil as it just try\u2019s to squeeze itself locked. Then it just stalls. FCA executive agrees the instruction do not line up with the way it\u2019s described to work.   What will it take? A small child\u2019s hand, a dogs leg, or someone\u2019s fingers?  Dealer said it was pinch sensors but now stated they are not the issue. It\u2019s a poor design with power lift gate strut.  Vehicle was in shop for 45 days.",

THE VEHICLE WAS IN ANOTHER COUNTY SO THEY DELIVERED IT AT NIGHT TO MY HOME. BEFORE PURCHASING IT, I ASKED THE MANAGER TO DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE HOOD WAS IN FACT THE SPORT HOOD IN THE PICTURE ADVERTISED. HE CALLED & CHECKED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE HOOD WAS THE SPORT HOOD. IT WAS DELIVERED WITH A DIFFERENT HOOD. I BELIEVE THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. I WANT THE HOOD THAT THEY PROMISED ME.  NOW THE EVEN BIGGER ISSUES. I WAS WASHING MY VEHICLE WHEN I DISCOVERED A CRIMPED RUBBER PART ALONG THE DRIVER'S SIDE PASSENGER DOOR. THEN A PAINT DEFECT AROUND THE WINDOW. THEN THE DOOR BEING CROOKED AND NOT LINED WITH THE VEHICLE. WITH ALL THE DAMAGE TO THE DOOR, I BELIEVE THERE WAS TROUBLE ON THE PRODUCTION LINE. THERE IS ALSO A PIECE MISSING ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR PANEL AT THE LATCH TO OPEN THE DOOR. THE PART IS NOT THERE. THE BOLT IS EXPOSED. ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT DOOR, WHEN OPENING, THERE IS A BLACK HOSE THAT COVERS ELECTRICAL WIRING. THAT PART IS PULLED AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE WIRES ARE HANGING.   I PAID $49,000 FOR THIS VEHICLE. IT IS CLEARLY NOT PUT TOGETHER WELL. IT HAS DEFECTS EVERYWHERE. ARRIGO DODGE WANTS TO TRY TO REPAIR IT. THESE ISSUES ARE NOT REPAIRABLE, THESE ARE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. I AM REQUESTING A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE WITH THE CORRECT HOOD AS ADVERTISED. I DID NOT SPEND ALMOST $50K FOR A DEFECTED VEHICLE THAT THEY WANT TO PATCH UP. PLEASE HELP ME.",
