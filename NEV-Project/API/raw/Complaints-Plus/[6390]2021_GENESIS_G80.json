This is unsafe.  My vehicle is not the only one experiencing this problem  - see https://genesisowners.com/genesis-forum/threads/voice-text.37457/ for other reports and more details.  I have contacted Genesis USA several times with no luck. I have returned the car for service multiple times with no resolution.",
