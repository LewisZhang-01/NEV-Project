IF YOU TURN IT TOO HARD, IT BREAKS AND YOU REQUIRE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE CONSOLE WHICH COSTS AROUND $388.00  PLUS THE LABOR REQUIRED TO INSTALL IT, THEN THE TOTAL WILL BE AROUND $675.00!  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE 2008 BUT IT WORSENED WITH TIME TO THE POINT OF BREAKING RECENTLY.  THE TWO OUTSIDE KNOBS ON THE HVAC UNIT (THE KNOBS THAT CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE AND WHERE THE AIR FLOWS OUT FROM) ARE CONNECTED TO THE HEATER CORE VIA METAL WIRES. WHEN YOU TURN THE TEMPERATURE KNOB TO THE RIGHT THE WIRE PUSHES OUT AND WHEN YOU TURN IT BACK TO THE LEFT THE WIRE PULLS IN. THIS WIRE IS CONNECTED TO A PIECE OF PLASTIC ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE HEATER CORE. THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC IS CONNECTED TO A GEAR AND IS SUPPOSED TO WORK HARMONIOUSLY WITH THE PIECE OF PLASTIC THE AIRFLOW KNOB (RIGHT OUTSIDE KNOB ON HVAC UNIT) IS CONNECTED TO. THAT IS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.    THESE TWO PIECES OF PLASTIC, BLEND LINK AND LEVER, WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO SLIDE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE TURNING OF THE KNOBS, DON'T WORK WELL AND THE WIRE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO FORCE THE PIECE INTO THE HEAT POSITION. THE RESULT IS THE WIRE OFTEN KINKS.  ON THE DRIVER SIDE, UNDER THE DASH, UP AND TO THE RIGHT THERE ARE TWO PIECES OF WHITE PLASTIC, ONE CLOSER TO THE FIREWALL THEN THE OTHER. THERE IS A METAL WIRE CLIPPED TO EACH. THIS IS THE PART YOU HAVE TO TURN TO CHANGE IT TO HEAT.  THE 'BOTTOM' IS THE TEMPERATURE KNOB. YOU CAN EITHER GRAB THE WIRE OR THE PIECE OF PLASTIC IT CONNECTS TO AND TURN IT TOWARD THE FIREWALL  MOST PEOPLE SIMPLY TURN THE DEVICE BY HAND NOW BUT THAT?S NOT SAFE TO DO WHILE DRIVING!  I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECTIVE DESIGN BY MITSUBISHI THAT RESULTS IN A SAFETY HAZARD WHEN THE WIND SHIELD FOGS UP AND YOU CAN?T TURN THE KNOB BECAUSE IT KINKS.

I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE A SERVICE TECHNICIAN OILED IT. THAT HELPED FOR A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IT STARTED STICKING AGAIN. BASICALLY, IT WOULD FEEL AS IT THE KNOB WAS STUCK BETWEEN HOT AND COLD. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FORCED BEYOND THAT POINT. ONCE FORCED, IT WOULD EITHER NOT STICK IN THE MOST EXTREME TEMPERATURE SETTING (I.E. MAX AC OR HIGHEST HEAT SETTING) OR IT WOULD NOT MOVE MUCH AT ALL. IT WOULD OFTEN FEEL AS IF IT WERE ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP IN 2005, WHERE I WAS TOLD IT WAS A COMMON COMPLAINT AMONG 2003 LANCER OWNERS. THE SERVICE TECH AT THAT TIME TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $800 TO FIX BUT THAT SO LONG AS THE HEATING AND AC WORKED MOST OF THE TIME, IT WOULD BE SMARTER TO HOLD OFF UNTIL MITSUBISHI ISSUED A RECALL. HE INDICATED THAT A RECALL WAS IMMINENT BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS HE WAS AWARE OF. THE KNOB ON MY CAR OFFICIALLY BROKE LAST WEEK. THERE IS STILL NO RECALL ON THE PART, BUT A SERVICE TECHNICIAN I SPOKE TO THIS MORNING SAID THAT MITSUBISHI RECENTLY RELEASED A FIX-IT KIT TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO HIM, THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT IT WOULD COST $1,000 TO REPAIR, BECAUSE THE ENTIRE DASH HAS TO BE REMOVED TO MAKE THE REPAIR. TOTAL ESTIMATED REPAIR TIME IS ABOUT 8 HOURS. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON ENOUGH TO WARRANT A RECALL ON THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL KNOB AND COMPANY-PAID REPAIR.  *TR",

I PUT A NEW TOWEL ON FLOOR AREAS EVERY DAY AND THEY ARE DRIPPING WET BY THE END OF THE DAY. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE EXACT PROBLEM IS.  IT IS DANGEROUS NOT TO HAVE A FAN FOR DEFROST/DEFOG ISSUES.  I WENT ALL WINTER LAST WINTER WITHOUT ANY HEAT/DEFROST.  I AM SO TIRED OF REPLACING THIS PART. THE REPAIRS ARE REALLY TAKING A TOLL ON MY FINANCES TOO.  IT IS VERY INCONVENIENT TO HAVE TO KEEP TAKING THE CAR IN TO BE REPAIRED. *JB",

I ORDERED A NEW CLUTCH HAD THEM INSTALL IT... SAME PROBLEM CONTINUED. SO I PAID ANOTHER 700 FOR A NEW CLUTCH FOR NO REASON. THEN THEY REDIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL. THEY REPLACED THAT UNDER WARRANTY... PROBLEM WAS FIXED. I WAS BABYING THE CAR FOR A WEEK OR SO BECAUSE OF THE CLUTCH BREAK IN PERIOD IS SUGGESTED 1000 MILES.

THE ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH A OBD-II 'ENGINE WARNING' CODE CELL 0300 I REPEATEDLY GET WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY.  I EXPERIENCE THIS WARNING UP TO 5 TIMES A DAY DURING MY 20 MILE FREEWAY COMMUTE.  THE CEL WARNING COMES ON MOST OFTEN DURING VERY LIGHT ACCELERATION INPUTS (5-15% THROTTLE) WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN SPEED WITH THE OTHER TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD.  WHILE GENTLY TOUCHING THE THROTTLE, THERE IS A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT ENGINE MISFIRING THAT SLOWS THE CAR DOWN CONSIDERABLY.  THIS MAKES ME A SAFETY HAZARD ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE AGAIN UNTIL I LET OFF THE THROTTLE COMPLETELY THEN JAB IT VIOLENTLY (50% OR MORE THROTTLE).  THIS ERROR REPEATS EACH TIME I USE GENTLE THROTTLE INPUTS ON THE FREEWAY.  AS A RESULT, I DRIVE AROUND WITH MY \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT LIT ALMOST 100% OF THE TIME.      IN THE STATE OF CA, IF YOUR ENGINE LIGHT IS ON WHEN YOU GO FOR YOUR ANNUAL SMOG/EMISSIONS TEST, YOU ARE INSTANTLY FAILED!  MY CAR WOULD FAIL AN EMISSIONS TEST IN THIS STATE BECAUSE THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY.    3.  I APPROACHED THE DEALER WITH THIS ISSUE.  THEY REPLACED THE COIL PACKS AND THE SPARK PLUGS TO SEE IF THAT WOULD FIX THINGS.  AND WHILE THEY WERE VERY CORDIAL ABOUT FINDING THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM, AND FIXING IT UNDER WARRANTY, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIX MY CAR.  THEY ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE ECU TO THROW THIS ERROR CODE.  SO I AM CURRENTLY DRIVING A 1 YEAR OLD CAR THAT IS STILL SHUDDERING VIOLENTLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, CREATING A ROLLING ROADBLOCK WHEN SHUDDERING, AND IS AN INSTANT FAIL WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO A SMOG CHECK.  THIS PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY EFFECTS THE SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE AND THE RESALE VALUE OF MY VEHICLE AND NEEDS TO ADDRESSED RIGHT AWAY.*AK",

THE ADVISORY DID NOT STATE \"DIRECTLY RELATED\" WHICH WOULD MAKE SENSE, BUT ALLOWED FOR WARRANTY CANCELLATION DUE TO \"PERIPHERALLY RELATED\" WHICH IS ANYBODY'S GUESS.  SUGGEST THAT THIS VIOLATES THE MAGNUSSON ACT, AND THIS PRACTICE BY MITSUBISHI SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  CHANGING A CATBACK EXHAUST SYSTEM SEEMS UNRELATED TO A CLUTCH FAILURE, YET OWNERS ARE GETTING WARRANTY REJECTIONS FOR SUCH MINOR MODIFICATIONS.    THANK YOU",
