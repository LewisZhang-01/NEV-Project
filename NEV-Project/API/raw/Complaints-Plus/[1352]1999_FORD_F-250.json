We got to my friends house to move a car trailer for him up his steep driveway.  I hooked up to the trailer pulled it out, moved it around to line up to back up driveway & making the last adjustment all of a sudden I was turning my steering wheel but the tires were not turning, jumped out to find the output shaft of the steering box was cracked in half diagonally & the steering arm was laying on the street.  When I got under the truck & looked at the part that broke you could see it was fractured for a long time.  There was only about an 1/8\" on one side that was raw metal from just finally breaking. Thank God we are alive if it would have happened  going fast probably would have killed someone.",

I had to press with a lot of force to slow down and come to a stop with the engine still at high rpm and had trouble stopping.  Luckily, where I live there's not much traffic, and I made it to a shop with this issue.  Upon investigating, the accelerator cable became frayed where it enters the sheath and gets stuck there.  The Ford dealer didn't have a replacement in stock or any nationwide.  So I went to a junk yard to find one and found the same vehicle that had the same frayed accelerator cable.  I located a newer, second vehicle with less mileage with same cable that matched without any fraying.  In the meantime, I ordered a new accelerator cable through Ford, but it was backordered several months and tied up in shipping.  With this happening on these two same vehicles, I thought I should report it.  Thank you.",

DETACHMENT OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEED (65MPH) WITH PROPER INFLATION PRESSURE, CHECKED PRIOR TO BEGINNING OF TRAVEL.    PRIOR TO COMPLETE TREAD DETACHMENT, THE SUBJECT TIRE WAS REPAIRED FOR DAMAGE INCURRED BY A COMMON ROAD HAZARD (I.E., A NAIL PUNCTURE).  THIS, THE TIRE?S ONLY, REPAIR WAS PERFORMED BY A REPUTABLE SERVICE CENTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES SET BY US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.  MICHELIN DOES NOT CALL INTO QUESTION TIRE REPAIR AS THE CAUSAL FACTOR.  RATHER, MICHELIN ASSERTS THAT THEIR INSPECTION OF THE TIRE INDICATES TREAD DETACHMENT RESULTED FROM TIRE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE PUNCTURE. AND, ?EVIDENCE OF THIS IS FOUND WHEN TRACING THE STEEL CORD PATH FROM THE PUNCTURE/REPAIR TO THE INITIAL DETACHED AREA?. MICHELIN FEELS THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES.    I CHALLENGE MICHELIN?S DENIAL BASED ON (1) MICHELIN?S ADMISSION THAT THE ?INITIAL DETACHED AREA? OCCURRED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE REPAIR/PUNCTURE; (2) MICHELIN HAS A HISTORY OF TIRE RECALLS PERTAINING TO DEFECTS AND POTENTIAL TREAD DETACHMENT OF SIMILAR TIRES; AND (3) THE SUBJECT TIRE WAS MANUFACTURED DURING A PERIOD BOUNDED BY TWO LAREDO TIRE RECALLS, DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR TREAD DETACHMENT:    ?SEPTEMBER 2004, UNIROYAL VOLUNTARY RECALL OF 46,000 TIRES DUE TO POSSIBLE TREAD/BELT DETACHMENT.  ?JULY 2012, NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA #12T-019) RECALL OF APPROXIMATELY 800,000 UNIROYAL TIRES, DUE TO POSSIBLE TREAD BELT SEPARATION.    FURTHER, A MODICUM OF RESEARCH CLEARLY INDICATES THAT INSUFFICIENT TIRE BONDING AND OTHER MANUFACTURER DEFECTS ARE THE MOST FREQUENT CAUSE OF TREAD DETACHMENT.  THEREFORE, I WOULD SUSPECT COMPLETE TREAD DETACHMENT WOULD RESULT FROM A PREEXISTING TIRE DEFECT, RATHER THAN A NAIL PUNCTURE.    *TR",

I TOW A 30' 5TH WHEEL TRAILER AND WHEN ATTEMPTING TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE OR ANYTIME I LOOSE POWER BECAUSE OF A HILL  I WILL STEP ON THE GAS PEDAL FOR PASSING GEAR. THE TRUCK WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE IN SPEED UNTIL IT GETS TO 3500 RPMS AND THEN LOOSES POWER AT ONCE. THIS CONTINUES UNTIL 4500 RPMS AND THEN IT SEEMS TO GO INTO ANOTHER PHASE AND ACTS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEFORE BY A GREAT INCREASE IN POWER. I HAVE HAD THIS TO THE DEALER 4 TIMES ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND ALTHOUGH THEY ADMIT ITS A PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT. TODAY AFTER THE 4TH TRY I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DROVE A NEW 2000 F250 WITH A V10 MOTOR AND IT DID THE SAME THING. BECAUSE OF THAT THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS NOT CORRECTABLE BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM THAT IS COMMON WITH THIS MOTOR. HOGWASH! I TOLD THEM THAT 2 PROBLEMS DON'T MAKE A CURE BUT I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO DO. THIS IS A SAFTEY ISSUE BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT I HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEHIND ME WHEN I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PAS OR INCREASE SPEED ON A HILL AND BECAUSE OF THIS LOSSE OF POWER HAVE IMPEADED TRAFFIC AND CAUSE UNCALLED FOR CONGESTION. MY CALL TO FORD'S CUTOMER SERVICE LINE WASN'T ANY BETTER THAT MY CONVERSATION WITH PRESTON FORD'S SERVICE PEOPLE. A LOT OF DOUBLE TALK THAT MEANT THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO THEY PUNTED.

THE TRUCK HAS 25000 MILES AND SIX WEEKS AGO I COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL ON A SLIGHT CURVE IN THE ROAD GOING BETWEEN 30 AND 35 THE TRUCK BEHAVED AS IF IT WERE ON ICE!!!  I'M A COMMERCIAL DRIVER AND WAS ABLE TO REACT TO THIS SURPRISE.  I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE FIRESTONE RECALL AND WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT ALL FOUR TIRES WITH BETWEEN 40 TO 60 PERCENT TREAD REMAINING ARE SEPARATING.  I VALIDATED THIS AT A FIRESTONE DEALERSHIP YESTERDAY AND THEY CLAIM THESE TIRES ARE NOT IN THE RECALL.  THE UNSTABLE RIDE IS TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE, IF YOU APPLY THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN THE CONDITION ESPECIALLY AT 60-65MPH BECOMES TRECHEROUS.  THIS HEAVY AND OTHERWISE ROAD STEADY TRUCK MOVES LIKE A BASKETBALL.  LETTING OFF THE FUEL PEDDLE WORKS BEST.  THE DEALERSHIP PEOPLE HAVE NOT HELPED AT ALL. THEY SUGGEST WE ARE MAKING UP THE PROBLEM.  AS YOU LOOK AT THE CENTER TREAD AREA OF THE TIRES IT APPEARS TO BE WEAK AND UNEVEN TO THE TOUCH.  THE FIRESTONE REP. SUGGESTED A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER REASONS BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN TIRES WITH SEPARATIONS BETWEEN THE TREADS AS ARE NOW FORMING ON ALL FOUR TIRES.  I HAVE NEVER USED THE SPARE. I'M PROBABLY GOING TO PURCHASE MICHELIN TIRES VERY SOON.  THE FIRESTONE REP WANTS NEARLY $400 TO REPLACE WITH OTHER FIRESTONE TIRES.
