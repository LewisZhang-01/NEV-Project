I PULLED OVER TO A SAFE TURNOUT AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO STOP COMPLETELY AS THE BRAKES WERE SPONGY. WHEN I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK, THE ENGINE SPEED WAS OVER 2500 RPM. I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND COULD SMELL THE BRAKES. SUSPECTING A STUCK THROTTLE, I REMOVED THE PROTECTIVE COVER AND THE ACCELERATOR WAS BEING HELD OPEN BY THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE WHICH HAD BECOME DISCONNECTED AT THE THROTTLE LINKAGE AREA. I REMOVED THE ASSEMBLY AND PUSHED IT ASIDE SO WE COULD CONTINUE DRIVING.     I CONSIDER THIS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AS WE WERE DRIVING DOWN A GRADE AND I WAS TRYING TO APPLY THE BRAKES AT THE SAME TIME THE ENGINE WAS PUSHING US FASTER.     SINCE IT WAS SATURDAY I DRIVE TO THE DEALER. I KNEW THERE HAD BEEN A SIMILAR RECALL I CHECKED TO SEE IF OUR VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED AND IT WAS NOT BUT THE SERVICE ADVISOR WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE RECALL WHICH  FORD HAD DONE AS \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 13B04\" WHICH HE PROVIDED ME A COPY OF.    I HAVE SEEN THIS IN MY SON'S 2002 FORD TAURUS ALSO. THE CLIP THAT HOLDS THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE TO THE THROTTLE LINKAGE DISCONNECTS AND BECAUSE OF THE STIFFNESS, ACTUALLY PREVENTS THE ACCELERATOR LINKAGE FROM RETURNING TO IDLE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT FAILED, I CAN SEE THE SAME LINKAGE ON MY 2003 MERCURY SABLE WHICH OF COURSE IS A REPACKAGED TAURUS. THIS CLIP IS A VERY POOR DESIGN IN THAT IT DOES NOT DO A GOOD JOB OF HOLDING ONTO THE ACCELERATOR PIN. FROM OBSERVATION I KNOW THAT IT WAS USED IN AT LEAST 3 MODEL YEARS AND PERHAPS MORE.    THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A COURTESY FIX AS UNINTENDED ACCELERATION CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS AS THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE SHOWN. IT SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ANY VEHICLE THAT USED THIS DESIGN.

THE SPEED ROSE FROM 45 TO 48 TO 52 MPH WITHOUT MY TOUCHING THE PEDAL. I THEN BRAKED, AND THE CAR SLOWED, ONLY TO RESUME SPEEDING UP WHEN I LIFTED MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE. AFTER I BRAKED AGAIN, HARDER, THE CAR SLOWED AND THE GHOST ACCELERATION PROBLEM WENT AWAY. HOWEVER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE 50-MILE FREEWAY TRIP. THE PEDAL SEEMED TO BE MECHANICALLY STICKING. THE PROBLEM DID NOT SEEM TO BE ELECTRONIC, ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT BE SURE. AFTER EXITING THE FREEWAY, THE ACCELERATOR GOT STUCK SEVERAL TIMES WHILE ON LOCAL ROADS. I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM BY NOW AND WAS READY AT ANY TIME TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL IF NECESSARY. I DID SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL ONCE TO AVOID A POTENTIAL COLLISION WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION. WHILE THE CAR WAS IN NEUTRAL, I TRIED TAPPING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO SEE IF THAT WOULD UNSTICK IT. INSTEAD, THE RPMS MERELY INCREASED TO A HIGHER LEVEL, STICKING AGAIN AT THE HIGHER RATE. I MANAGED TO GET THE CAR HOME, MOSTLY ON THE FREEWAY, WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS MISHAPS. I PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL OF THE MUCH-REPORTED ACCELERATION PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA VEHICLES. HOWEVER, I CAN NOW SAY FROM EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN YOUR CAR HOLDS ITS SPEED OR SPEEDS UP AFTER YOU LIFT YOUR FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR, IT'S A STRANGE AND UNSETTLING EXPERIENCE. I CAN EASILY IMAGINE SOME DRIVERS PANICKING. WE WERE LUCKY THAT I WAS DRIVING, AND NOT MY WIFE OR KIDS, WHO HAVE MUCH LESS DRIVING EXPERIENCE. AT HOME, I DISCOVERED ONLINE THAT FORD HAS RECALLED MANY 2000-2003 TAURUSES FOR STICKING-ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S A PROBLEM FOR OUR 2004 TAURUS AS WELL.  *TR",

SHE WAS FORTUNATELY ABLE TO COAST TO THE SHOULDER, WHERE SHE PUT THE GEAR SELECTOR IN \"PARK\" AND TURNED THE IGNITION OFF.

I HAD IT TOWED TO A TRANSMISSION REPAIR FACILITY WHERE THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS OF THE TRANSMISSION WERE TESTED. THERE WERE NO MALFUNCTIONS DETECTED IN THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED, AS THE MALFUNCTION WAS DUE TO A FAILURE OF EITHER THE TORQUE CONVERTER, THE TRANSMISSION, OR POSSIBLY BOTH. THE REPAIR ESTIMATES WERE QUOTED TO BE ABOUT $850.00 IF THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A FAULTY TORQUE CONVERTER, WHICH THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME WAS A QUITE COMMON PROBLEM WITH THAT MODEL, AS THE SPLINES OFTEN STRIPPED OUT. THE SECOND QUOTE WAS FOR ABOUT $1500.00 IF METAL SHAVINGS ARE FOUND IN THE TRANSMISSION PAN, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE WAS A RESULT OF A FAULTY COMPONENT IN THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A TRANSMISSION OVERHAUL.

DRIVING DOWN AN INTERSTATE AND TRANSMISSION GO OR IN ATLANTA DOWNTOWN TRAFFIC AT QUITTING TIME IS QUITE A DANGER.  THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL LARGE CITIES.

I THINK THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS DUE TO THE WAY IT JUST STOPS. OF COURSE WHEN CONTACTING FORD MOTOR COMPANY THEY HAVE DENIED A PROBLEM WITH THE CARS.  I CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY PERSONALLY 30 TAURUS DRIVERS IN MY AREA THAT HAVE HAD TO REPLACE TRANSMISSIONS PRIOR TO 100,000 MILES.  WE EXPECT AS MUCH AS THEY COST FOR THIS TO LAST LONGER.  THE AUTOBEEF IS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE FOLKS THIS HAS HAPPENED TO.

I DID NOT KEEP THIS CAR AND WHEN IT WAS DUE TO BE RETURNED, I DID NOT CHOOSE ANOTHER FORD.  I WENT TO 5 DIFFERENT DEALERS AND TOLD THEM WHAT FORD HAD SAID ABOUT WHY THE AIR BAGS WERE NOT DEPLOYED AND NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER HEARD OF SUCH A COMMENT.  I STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM MY INJURIES IN THIS ACCIDENT AND WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE PUBLIC NOT TO RELY ON THE SAFETY OF AIRBAGS IN THIS CAR IF \"YOU HAVE TO HIT THE OTHER CAR IN A CERTAIN WAY.\"  THIS IS A FALSE SECURITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO BELIEVE IN AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD VEHICLE.  *JB",
