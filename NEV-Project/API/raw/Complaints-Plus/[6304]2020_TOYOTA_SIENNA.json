I DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE CAR.    I WAS GUARANTEED BY THE DEALER THAT THE CAR IS IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION BEFORE PURCHASE. HOWEVER, AFTER DRIVING THE NEW CAR FOR FEW DAYS, THE KEY REMOTE STOPPED WORKING AND I REVISITED THE DEALERSHIP TO GET IT FIXED. I TALKED TO JIMMY ROCKER, ONE OF THE SALE ASSOCIATES, AND HE TRANSFERRED ME TO THE TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER. AFTER FEW MORE DAYS OF DRIVING THE CAR, MORE PROBLEMS EMERGED. THE CAR WARNING MONITOR INDICATED 'AWD SYSTEM MALFUNCTION 2WD MODE ENGAGED, CONTACT YOUR DEALER' AS WELL AS 'BRAKE OVERRIDE MALFUNCTION, VISIT YOUR DEALER'. NOT ONLY THE WARNINGS, THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED ON THE HIGHWAY. LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME, OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED.   THE SECOND TIME I REVISITED THE DEALERSHIP, I ENCOUNTERED CHRIS THOMPSON, THE NEW CAR DIRECTOR AT PRINCIPLE TOYOTA. I SUGGESTED HIM TO INSPECT MY CAR AND FINDING A SOLUTION FOR IT. I HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM HOW IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. I HAVE TWO KIDS WHO ARE DRIVING WITH ME AND IF THE SITUATION HAPPENED AGAIN, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FATALLY INJURED. CHRIS DID NOT LISTEN TO MY STORY BUT INSTEAD TOLD ME THAT THE CAR DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM AND HE JUST WALKED AWAY IN FRONT OF OUR CONVERSATION. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE OF HIS INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS MY SITUATION AND THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE I RECEIVED WAS NOT EXPECTED FROM A WELL-KNOWN COMPANY LIKE YOURS.     TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF KIDS AND MY FAMILY, I DEMAND A REPLACEMENT OF THE CAR AS WELL AS ANY COMPENSATION ASSOCIATED MY SPENT TIME AT THE DEALERSHIP.       I HOPE THERE WILL BE A REASONABLE SOLUTION FOR MY CASE.
