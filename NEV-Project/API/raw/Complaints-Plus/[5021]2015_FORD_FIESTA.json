My local dealer inspected the clutch slave cylinder and it appeared to be operational and otherwise fine. The risk this poses is that i need to be able to shift gears and otherwise operate the car properly in case of an emergency. a sticking clutch pedal prevents me from being able to select the correct gear for my road speed, and it affects the ability for a controlled takeoff from a stop, this potentially affects my ability to react to an emergency as well.

I also noticed the \u201cHill Assist Control\u201d alert pops up on the radio monitor with the involuntary braking. As well as the sound of the door being open with the key in the ignition will come on while the involuntary braking occurs. Additionally, the windows were resisting being rolled up while driving but will roll up when in park. I also noticed this braking problem tends to reoccur with accelerating quickly or making a turn. On friday afternoon on 11/5/21, I had cautiously drove with my hazards on, while the intermittent involuntary braking problem continued to persist, to my local Autonation Ford to ask about a safety recall associated with this involuntary braking problem and they told me there was no safety recall associated with this problem at this time. They told me that I would need to pay $1100 to replace and reprogram my cluster/dashboard computer. This is unacceptable given the inherent safety risks associated with this intermittent and involuntary braking problem. I believe I should be able to replace and reprogram my cluster/dashboard computer for free due to the safety risks. Thank you for reviewing and considering my proposal of my safety issue.",

THE CAR HAD NEVER EXHIBITED ANY BRAKING OR ACCELERATION ISSUES BEFORE THIS DAY.  THE FIRST INCIDENT, I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO GO OVER A SPEED BUMP.  AS I WAS APPLYING THE BRAKE, THE CAR JERKED FORWARD THEN STOPPED.  IT DROVE AS NORMAL THROUGH TRAFFIC FOR THE NEXT 8 MILES.  I WAS CLOSE TO MY DESTINATION, AS I WAS APPLYING THE BRAKE AT A STOP LIGHT, THE CAR SPED UP AND STOPPED WHEN I PULLED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  AGAIN, THE CAR DROVE FINE FOR THE NEXT  MILE.  I WAS VERY AWARE WHILE I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE.  NEITHER THE BRAKE OR ACCELERATOR WAS APPLIED AS I WAS COASTING INTO A SPACE.  AS I APPLIED THE BRAKE, THE CAR SPED UP, JUMPED THE CURB AND ACCELERATED INTO THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.  ACCORDING TO A WITNESS AND SUPPORTED BY PATTERN OF SKID MARKS, AT ONE POINT THE CAR WAS AIRBORNE. WITH THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT 15 FEET BETWEEN THE CURB AND WALL, THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO REACT.  IN MY ATTEMPT TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, I INJURED MY THUMB.  MY PASSENGER SUSTAINED VARIOUS BRUISES FROM THE SEAT BELT AND THE FRONT DASHBOARD.  NEITHER THE DRIVER NOR PASSENGER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.  ACCORDING TO THE BLACK BOX REPORT, THE CAR ACCELERATED FROM 0-100% IN THE FINAL 5 SECONDS AND THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED AT 10%-55%, YET THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE.  I DID NOT REMOVE MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE UNTIL AFTER THE CAR IMPACT, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY SKID MARKS SHOWN IN PHOTOS.   IN AUGUST 2019, FORD MOTOR WAS AWARE OF A TRANSMISSION CLUTCH SHUTTER ISSUE, BUT STILL PROCEEDED WITH SELLING THE CAR TO AN AUCTION.  ONE MONTH LATER, I PURCHASED FROM A DEALERSHIP.",
