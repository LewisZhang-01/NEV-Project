        "summary": "Honda Civic, 2006, engine block cracked and car overheated due to coolant loss without alerting driver to safety concerns, putting him/herself in jeopardy, along with other drivers/passengers. Overheating causes engines to stop operating which is extremely dangerous and costly.  Driver ascertained that something wasn\u2019t right at lower speeds (residence/business district). A faint whining was coming from the dashboard. This would likely not have been heard driving at faster speeds, and/or with the radio on. Once parked the operator smelled and saw smoke emanating from the vehicle hood and noticed leaking under the car. There was no prior warning sign.  According to recent communication with Honda America by the operator, this engine block failure is a known issue and a result of a casting problem during manufacturing. A voluntary warranty extension was made in 2014 for 2006 - 2008 (extended to 2009) for Honda Civics for 10 years from the date of purchase. Unfortunately, many drivers, who were/are unaware of the warranty extension/issue, and for whom hadn\u2019t detected/or had a problem prior are unknowingly driving ticking time bombs around. This warranty extension has since expired. Honda has not made an official recall and is not keeping drivers informed about the prevailing issue, which is unknowingly putting drivers at risk.  Based on sales data for North America there were roughly 1.2 million Honda Civics sold between 2006 and 2009, many of which are still on the road today. For a refurbished engine (not new), plus labor it is estimated to cost between $1,500 - $2,000 for repairs. This doesn\u2019t take into account the cost of human or vehicle harm.  Video evidence of leaking at mechanics/smoking vehicle can be provided.

THEY ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE A PART THAT THEY PUT IN MY CAR THAT THEY KNOW IS FAULTY JUST BECAUSE I HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS. THE AGE OF THE CAR IS IRRELEVANT (ALTHOUGH, FOR THE RECORD, IT'S IN EXCELLENT CONDITION) WE CALLED HONDA HEADQUARTERS TWICE TODAY, AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING.

AFTER SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON AND WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH THE 2006-2009 CIVICS. I CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. FUNNY HOW I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICES WHATSOEVER AND DID NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CLUE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM ONE YEAR PAST THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND HONDA WILL COVER NOTHING AT ALL. CAR HAS 63,000 MILES AND IS OTHERWISE IN MINT CONDITION. ASKED HONDA TO PROVE THAT THEY SENT OUT THE NOTICE TO ME AND THEY HAVE YET TO RESPOND. HAD I RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION OF THIS ISSUE I WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY TRADED THE CAR. NOW I AM STUCK WITH AN INOPERABLE CAR AND AN $8,900.00 REPAIR (QUOTED BY HONDA DEALERSHIP). TOTALLY LEFT IN THE DARK, BUT HAPPY TO BE ALIVE.   THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE ALL OVER THE INTERNET JUST GOOGLE HONDA CIVIC CRACKED ENGINE BLOCK AND HUNDREDS MAYBE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS WILL POP UP.

AFTER WORKING ON THE CAR TO FIND THE LEAK AND DOING RESEARCH ONLINE I FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A KNOWN MANUFACTURE DEFECT FOR 2006-2009 HONDA CIVICS THAT CAUSES A FAILURE AND CRACK IN THE ENGINE BLOCK.  THERE IS A 10 YEAR WARRANTY EXTENSION, WHICH I AM BEYOND BY 5 MONTHS SO HONDA HAS REFUSED TO FIX THE VEHICLE UNDER WARRANTY.    AS AN OWNER OF TWO HONDA VEHICLES I AM SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY SINCE I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THIS BY MAIL OR OTHERWISE BY HONDA.  I HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THEM REGARDING OTHER ISSUES ON MY 2011 ACCORD, BUT NEVER ABOUT THE 2006 CIVIC.  IF I HAD I MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS PROBLEM WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD AS A SMALL LEAK BEFORE IT BEGAN DUMPING/POURING COOLANT.  LUCKILY, THIS NEVER LED TO SEVERE ENGINE DAMAGE DUE TO OVERHEATING WHILE DRIVING, WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS RISK OF ACCIDENT AND INJURY.    IN ADDITION, HONDA WAS EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE AND UNHELPFUL ON THE PHONE.  AFTER DAYS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM THEY FINALLY GAVE ME A CLAIM NUMBER FOR THE ISSUE.  ONCE DENYING IT THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD CALL THEIR CLAIMS DEPARTMENT, WHICH I ALREADY BELIEVED I WAS SPEAKING TO.  TO MY SURPRISE THE NUMBER THEY GAME ME WAS FOR THE COURT SYSTEM THAT HAD RULED ON THIS CASE FOR HONDA.  SO, AFTER WASTING MY TIME WITH THEM THEY FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO PLAY WHAT AMOUNTED TO A PRACTICAL JOKE ON ME.  THE WORST JOKE OF ALL IS THAT THEY HAVE FAILED ME AS A CUSTOMER IN ALL POSSIBLE WAYS.    I FULLY BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE MADE A COMPLETE RECALL, AS IT IS A KNOWN MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND NO FAULT OF ANY CUSTOMER WHO OWNS ONE OF THESE VEHICLES.  *TR",

THEY CALLED LATER THAT AFTERNOON TO SAY IT WAS A CRACKED ENGINE BLOCK AND WOULD BE $5000 + TAX FOR A NEW BLOCK. THEY TRIED TO GET HONDA TO HONOR THE TSB-08-044 WARRANTY BUT IT WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE TIME FRAME FOR THE WARRANTY SO HONDA REFUSED.   THE CAR HAS AROUND 148K MILES ON IT AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN FOR ALL REGULAR MAINTENANCE SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR USED IN 2010 AT 30K MILES. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE BLOCK EVEN THOUGH THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY EXTENSION TO 8 YEARS HAPPENED IN AUGUST 2010. I DID HOWEVER GET THE AIRBAG RECALL NOTICE EARLIER THIS YEAR, SO HONDA KNOWS I OWN THE CAR AND SHOULD HAVE LET ME KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE WARRANTY. CHECKING ON THE INTERNET, THIS ENGINE BLOCK FAILURE IS STILL HAPPENING TO WAY TOO MANY HONDA CIVICS AFTER 10 YEARS WITH MANY RANGES OF MILEAGE, BUT HONDA IS REFUSING TO HELP IN ANY WAY FOR A KNOWN CASTING ISSUE WITH THE ENGINE BLOCK. MY TWO PREVIOUS HONDA CIVICS I OWNED FOR 11 YEARS WITH 208 K MILES AND 9 YEARS WITH 205K MILES AND NEITHER OF THEM HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THE ENGINE BLOCK. THE HONDA DEALER THAT SOLD ME THE CAR IN 2010 SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND DIDN'T AND HONDA ITSELF SHOULD HAVE INFORMED ME OF THE WARRANTY EXTENSIONS IN 2010 AND 2013 BUT DIDN'T.

THEY ALSO HAD ME PAY 10% FOR REPLACEMENT OF COILS.    ALL THIS DAMAGE WAS DUE TO THE FAULTY ENGINE BLOCK.  TSB STATES REPLACE THE COILS AND CHECK FOR HEAD GASKET DAMAGE.  IF DAMAGE IS FOUND GO TO STEP ??  I CONCLUDE IT MEANS REPLACE THE GASKET CYLINDER HEAD.    HONDA CLEARLY KNOWS OF THIS ISSUE AND HAS NOT ISSUED ANY RECALLS.

THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS OF PEOPLE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY ONLY TO RAPIDLY LOSE POWER TO ALL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE BRAKES AND POWER STEERING. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS IS A PROFOUND SAFETY HAZARD, NOT ONLY TO THE DRIVER, BUT OTHER DRIVERS AS WELL! THAT BEING SAID, HONDA ADMITTED THAT THE TENDENCY FOR BLOCKS TO CRACK WAS DUE A FAULTY CASTING PROCESS. THEY HAD ISSUES AN INITIAL 8 YEAR WARRANTY AND INCREASED THAT TO 10 YEARS. AS OF LATE, MANY CURRENT OWNERS HAVE STILL HAD THEIR BLOCKS CRACKED. ONLY THIS TIME, HONDA IS REFUSING TO FIX THEIR FAULTY PRODUCT. AS SUCH, I WANTED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE THIS MATTER. A CAR'S BLOCK UNDER NORMAL MAINTENANCE AND USE SHOULD NEVER CATASTROPHICALLY FAIL, LET ALONE RISK PEOPLE'S LIVES!

THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS OF PEOPLE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY ONLY TO RAPIDLY LOSE POWER TO ALL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE BRAKES AND POWER STEERING. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS IS A PROFOUND SAFETY HAZARD, NOT ONLY TO THE DRIVER, BUT OTHER DRIVERS AS WELL!    THAT BEING SAID, HONDA ADMITTED THAT THE TENDENCY FOR BLOCKS TO CRACK WAS DUE A FAULTY CASTING PROCESS. THEY HAD ISSUES AN INITIAL 8 YEAR WARRANTY AND INCREASED THAT TO 10 YEARS. AS OF LATE, MANY CURRENT OWNERS HAVE STILL HAD THEIR BLOCKS CRACKED. ONLY THIS TIME, HONDA IS REFUSING TO FIX THEIR FAULTY PRODUCT.     AS SUCH, I WANTED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE THIS MATTER. A CAR'S BLOCK UNDER NORMAL MAINTENANCE AND USE SHOULD NEVER CATASTROPHICALLY FAIL, LET ALONE RISK PEOPLE'S LIVES! EVEN IF A RECALL ISN'T ENFORCED, AT LEAST HOLD HONDA ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR FAULTY ENGINES AND PLACE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. THANK YOU.  *TR",

I WANT HONDA TO NOTIFY ALL CUSTOMERS OF THIS PROBLEM AND ALSO PAY FOR MY DAMAGES DUE TO THEIR NEGLIGENCE.    ON MONDAY, MARCH 17, AROUND 9AM, MY 2006 HONDA CIVIC SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING CUT OUT COMPLETELY AND HAD NO STEERING. I HAD JUST TAKEN AN EXIT RAMP, 291B TOWARDS CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA AND MIRACULOUSLY MADE IT TO THE SHOULDER OF THE OFF RAMP WITH NO POWER. MY HONDA CIVIC HAS ONLY 61,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED. I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A POLICE CAR PULL BEHIND ME AFTER WAITING ABOUT 20 HORRIFYING MINUTES. THE OFFICER SAID SHE WOULD PARK BEHIND ME BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS GOING TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND. TRAFFIC WAS HEAVY AND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE FLYING OFF OF I64 ON TO THIS 291B EXIT RAMP.    IT WAS A SHOCK TO LEARN LATER THAT THE TENSIONER BOLT SUDDENLY BROKE OFF AND CAUSED THE WATER PUMP TO LOCK UP AND TENSIONER AND SERPENTINE BELTS TO BE DAMAGED. WHAT WAS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, WAS TO LEARN THAT  CERTAIN VIN NUMBERS HAD THE DRIVE BELT RECALLED TO INSTALL THE LONGER, REROUTED DRIVE BELT. THIS OBVIOUSLY NEEDED TO BE DONE ON MY CAR AS WELL.     I AM SHOCKED AND UPSET THAT I WAS PLACED IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A POTENTIALLY KNOWN TRAGEDY THAT COULD HAVE OCCURRED. I HAVE BEEN A VERY LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMER TO THIS POINT, BUT REQUIRE THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN.

WHEN I WAS GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, I APPLIED THE BRAKE NORMALLY TO SLOW DOWN BEFORE A CURVE WHEN THE SPEED WAS AT 60 MPH, BUT MY CAR WAS DRIFTING, NOT LIKE HYDROPLANING AT ALL. THERE WAS NO WATER TO CAUSE THAT BUT IT RAINED FIVE TO SIX HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF INCIDENT, THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NOT RESPONSIVE. WHEN IT STARTED TO DRIFT, IT SKIDDED TOWARDS THE INCOMING LANE. I TRIED TO CORRECT THE STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY, IT TOOK MUCH MORE FORCE TO OPERATE THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE DIRECTION WAS NOT CORRECTED, SO I ADJUSTED IT MORE. THEN THE HEAD SUDDENLY TURNED 60 TO 80 DEGREES AND HIT THE GUARDRAIL AND THEN THE CAR TURNED MORE THAN 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE; THEN THE TAIL HIT A STOP-SIGN POLE AND THE CAR STOPPED IN THE MUD. SINCE THE CAR WAS STILL DRIVABLE, I DID NOT CALL THE POLICE TO CHECK THE SCENE. I THINK IT WAS CAUSED BY HONDA'S DESIGN DEFECTS SINCE I HAD GOODYEAR FOUR-SEASON TIRES WITH MORE THAN ENOUGH GRIDS, SO I WANT TO HIRE AN INVESTIGATOR TO INVESTIGATE MY CASE AND ASK HONDA TO BUY THE CAR BACK. BUT NONE OF THE LAW FIRMS I CONTACTED COULD HELP ME.    DURING THE WHOLE COURSE, THERE WAS NO CAR COMING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. TWO CARS PASSED ME BY WHEN I WAS PULLING MY CAR OUT OF MUD BUT NONE OF THEM STOPPED, SO I GUESS THERE WAS NO WITNESS. THE FIRST TIME WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKE AGAIN AFTER THE INCIDENT, I FELT THE BRAKE WAS FLIMSY, SO I DROVE MUCH SLOWER LATER, AT AROUND 40 MPH. I AM NOT SURE IF THE BRAKE COULD HANDLE THAT WET ROAD AGAIN, BUT MOST OF TIME AT MOST PLACES THE BRAKE DOES NOT FAIL, SO I ASSUME I EXPERIENCED A CASE, ON WET ROAD WITH DOWNHILL GRAVITY, THAT THE CAR IS INCAPABLE OF HANDLING.   *TT",

THEY ARE SO DISMISSIVE AND UNHELPFUL...  PLEASE HELP!!!!  *TR",

HONDA HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IN FEBRUARY 2009, I RECEIVED A \"PRODUCT UPDATE: REROUTING THE DRIVE BELT\" WHICH ALSO RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE BOLT.  PRIOR TO THIS, ON OCTOBER 3, 2007 AT 35,954 MILES I TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA BECAUSE OF A WHINING NOISE AND THEY REROUTED THE BELT - BUT DID NOT REPLACE THE BOLT.

AFTER PUTTING 15,000 MILES ON IT (BOUGHT USED WITH 64,404 MILES ON IT), MY TIRES WORE OUT DUE TO UNEVEN TIRE WEAR AT THE INNER EDGES. FORTUNATELY BY CHANCE, JUST BEFORE WE EMBARKED ON A 1500 MILE TRIP, I JUST ACCIDENTALLY HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT THE BELTS WERE SHOWING ON THE INNER EDGE OF MY RIGHT REAR TIRE. THIS WAS NOT READILY NOTICEABLE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR, UNTIL I CRAWLED UNDER THE BACK END OF MY CAR TO CHECK ON SOMETHING ELSE. FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE OUTER EDGES AND MID-SECTIONS OF MY TIRES, I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT MY TIRES WERE IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT AND THAT THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN! AFTER INSPECTING THE OTHER TIRES ON MY CAR, I ENDED UP REPLACING A TOTAL OF THREE TIRES. HOWEVER, THIS WILL NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH MY TIRE-EATING CAR, SINCE THE REAR UPPER CONTROL ARMS REQUIRE REPLACEMENT, AS OUTLINED IN HONDA TSB 08-001. I WENT TO THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER AND WAS INFORMED BY A SERVICE REP THAT THEY HANDLE THESE CLAIMS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. SINCE I DID NOT SAVE MY WORN OUT TIRES AND DUE TO THE CURRENT MILEAGE ON MY CAR, I DECIDED THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A WASTE OF TIME FOR ME TO TRY TO GET HONDA TO REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS AT THEIR EXPENSE. AFTER REVIEWING TSB 08-001, IT IS MY OPINION THAT HONDA SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND INITIATE AN IMMEDIATE SAFETY RECALL TO CORRECT THIS CONDITION. PREMATURE TIRE WEAR DUE TO THE REAR UPPER CONTROL ARM CONFIGURATION APPEARS TO BE A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THESE 06 & 07 CIVIC MODELS, AS INDICATED BY THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF AFTERMARKET ADJUSTABLE REAR UPPER CONTROL ARMS/CAMBER KITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. MY CIVIC NOW STAYS PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY ALL OF THE TIME. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION THAT IS NOT EASILY OR READILY NOTICEABLE TO CONSUMERS!  *TT",

I DO SOME RESEARCH AND FIND OUT THERE IS A TSB: HONDA DESIGNED THE CONTROL ARMS WRONG CAUSING PREMATURE WEAR OF THE TIRES.  THE FIX IS TO REPLACE THEM WITH NEWLY DESIGNED CONTROL ARMS.  SO, HONDA SHOULD PAY FOR IT CONSIDERING THEY DESIGNED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  HONDA WILL NOT PAY FOR IT.  ESSENTIALLY, HONDA IS ADMITTING THE PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE BY REPLACING IT WITH A NEWLY DESIGNED PRODUCT.  MY PURCHASED AN AFTERMARKET WARRANTY FROM THE HONDA STEALERSHIP: THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS CLAIMING \"IT IS A DEFECT CAUSED BY HONDA\" AND THE PART IS NOT BROKEN.  THE CONSUMER LOSES ONCE AGAIN AND HONDA TAKES THE MONEY.  THIS IS NOT THE ONLY DEFECTIVE DESIGN ON THIS CAR: THE ENGINE BLOCK CRACKS DUE TO IMPROPER CASTING, THE CHEAP VISORS BREAK: AT LEAST HONDA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THIS TO 8 YEARS.  AFTER THAT, I GUESS YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK.  THIS IS MY 6TH HONDA.  I ALSO HAVE A HONDA LAWNMOWER AND POWERWASHER.  HONDA WAS THE ONLY VEHICLE I WOULD BUY DUE TO THEIR HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABILITY.

THE 1ST TIME THIS HAPPENED (SUMMER OF '09) THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT A PEBBLE HIT THE (APPARENTLY EXTREMELY FRAGILE) CONDENSER UNIT, CAUSING A LEAK. THEY SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRIS, SO THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME OVER $1300 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM (THE FIRST TIME). I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND TONS OF THESE CASES WITH HONDA VEHICLES. APPARENTLY THE CONDENSER IS NOT PROPERLY PROTECTED AGAINST DEBRIS LIKE IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS HONDA HAS A RECALL TO FIX THE PROBLEM.    WHEN I SPOKE TO HONDA AMERICA, THEY LIKENED THE FAILURE TO A CHIPPED WINDSHIELD. DURING COMMON, EVERYDAY, FREEWAY DRIVING, THE DAMAGE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS A CHIPPED WINDSHIELD. THE WINDSHIELD IS A PROTECTIVE DEVICE, AND THEREFORE DEFLECTING PEBBLES AND OTHER ROAD HAZARDS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DESIGNED FOR.    THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IMAGINE, PEBBLES ACTUALLY HITTING A MOVING VEHICLE A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND--AS IF THAT'S AVOIDABLE! MY QUESTION IS, DID HONDA FORGET THAT PEOPLE TEND TO USE THEIR CARS ON ROADS?? OR DID THEY SIMPLY FORGET WHAT ROADS ARE MADE OF? I COULD GO TO HONDA'S SERVICE DEPT TOMORROW AND HAVE THE [XXX] THING FIXED, DRIVE AWAY AND THE SAME PROBLEM COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.

WHEN THE GASOLINE ENGINE IS ALSO BEING TAXED WITH GENERATING ELECTRIC POWER FOR BATTERY RECALIBRATION, THE TOTAL LOSS OF POWER IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND RESULTS IN AN ALREADY SLOW CAR (0-60 IN 13.5 SECONDS) BECOMING DANGEROUS WHEN TRYING TO CROSS INTERSECTIONS OR MERGE INTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC.  MY RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THIS PROBLEM STEMS FROM PREMATURE DEGRADATION OF THE HYBRID BATTERY PACK. *TR",

CAR NEEDS TO BE REVVED TO 5K TO GET OVER 35MPH, AFTER THAT GAS ENGINE ITSELF STARTS TO PICK UP SPEED.  MILEAGE HAS DROPPED FROM 45+ TO MIDDLE 30'S SINCE IT STARTED HAPPENING 2 YEARS AGO.

FOR EXAMPLE, ENTERING THE FREEWAY ON A ONRAMP WITH A LIGHT. IF IT HAPPENS THEN, THE CAR MAY JUST BE AT BARELY 30MPH WHEN ENTERING THE FREEWAY, FULLY REVVED. OR MAKING A LEFT TURN WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC, CAR MAY MOVE SLOWLY FROM THE STAND STILL INSTEAD OF PRODUCING THE SHARP ACCELERATION EXPECTED TO GET OUT OF HARMS WAY FAST. OR WHEN PASSING ON THE FREEWAY. ON HIGHWAYS I JUST DON'T TRUST THE CAR ENOUGH TO DO IT, AS I MAY NOT GET FROM IT WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE MANEUVER BEFORE I GET ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I'M AFRAID EVERY TIME I NEED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.    RECALIBRATING HAPPEN AT LEAST A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK, SOME TIMES TWICE A DAY. *TR",

I'M HAVING A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM WITH THE HYBRID SYSTEM (IMA AS HONDA CALLS IT), BUT HONDA KEEPS TELLING ME ITS NORMAL BECAUSE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAULT CODE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT LAST YEAR I STARTED TO NOTICE THE HYBRID BATTERY WAS HAVING INCREASING TROUBLE HOLDING A CHARGE AND ACCURATELY REPORTING IT'S CHARGE CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IS THAT I'LL START DRIVING WITH THE CHARGE BEING REPORTED AT 70% FULL OR SO, AND WITHOUT WARNING, THE CHARGE DROPS TO 0 AND THE CAR BEGINS TO AGGRESSIVELY RECHARGE THE BATTERY. THIS AGGRESSIVE RECHARGING TAKES ABOUT 5-10 MINUTES AFTER WHICH IS REPORTS IT IS FULL. BUT HERE'S WHERE THE DANGER LIES, IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF MINUTES, THERE IS NO ASSIST AVAILABLE FROM THE HYBRID BATTERY. WHEN STARTING FROM A STOPPED POSITION, THE CAR IS EXTREMELY SLUGGISH AND SLOW. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CASES WHERE I HAVE BEEN PULLING ACROSS AN INTERSECTION WITH CROSS TRAFFIC THAT DOESN'T STOP AND THE CAR, WITHOUT WARNING, HAD SLIPPED INTO THIS RECHARGE STATE AND NEARLY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT - THE ONCOMING CARS HAD TO BRAKE AS I MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE INTERSECTION. MY HONDA DEALER AND HONDA OF AMERICA WILL NOT LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM UNLESS THERE IS A FAULT CODE. I KNOW THAT OTHERS HAVE HAD ALMOST THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CIVICS.

I HAVE ALWAYS STOPPED THE CAR BY BRAKING AND THEN STARTED IT UP. IT TAKES ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE THE POWER RETURNS. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS WITH TRAFFIC AROUND.  A FEW DAYS AGO WHILE DRIVING UP A 7 MILE DIRT ROAD GOING ABOUT 15 TO 25 MPH IT HAPPENED 3 TIMES IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.

THEY HAVE TRIED.    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPUTER SYSTEM SINCE THERE ARE IDIOSYNCRASIES WITH THE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BATTERY CHARGE LIGHT CAN SUDDENLY SHOWED THE BATTERY NEARLY UNCHARGED AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOW IT NORMALLY CHARGED. THIS SHOULD TAKE TIME SINCE THE BATTERY SHOULD CHARGE OVER TIME.

HOWEVER, AS SOON AS I GOT THE CAR BACK, IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD ALSO BEEN BADLY DAMAGED AS A RESULT, AND NOW THE TRANSMISSION GRINDS EVERY TIME I TRY TO PUT THE CAR INTO 4TH GEAR.

HONDA WILL FIX THE PROBLEM ONLY IF ITS UNDER THE WARRANTY, BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE CAR IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY? AND I STILL THINK HONDA SHOULD FIX IT BECAUSE IT IS A MANUFACTURES FAULT FOR USING BAD HEATING MATERIAL ON ENGINE BLOCKS.     HERES A LINK TO A FORUM SITE \"\"HTTP://WWW.8THCIVIC.COM/FORUMS/MECHANICAL-PROBLEMS-TECHNICAL-CHAT/42339-MY-R18-BLOCK-CRACKED-CHECK-YOURS.HTML\"\"    P.S. SOME PEOPLE ALREADY MENTION THAT HONDA ALREADY KNOWN THIS PROBLEM BUT NEVER MENTION IT TO ALL THE CIVIC OWNERS........ THIS IS VERY SAD TO HEAR. *TR",

TWICE WHILE MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER THE MILEAGE WARRANTY, THE DRIVER'S SIDE SUN VISOR (PART #88380-SNA-A01ZA, H/C 8073496) FAILED.  FAILURE IN THIS CASE MEANS THE UNIT SPLIT APART AT THE SEAM CONNECTED TO THE ARM THAT HOLDS IT TO THE HEADLINER.  THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM IS TO REPLACE THE VISOR.  EACH TIME THE VISOR WAS REPLACED IT LASTED APPROXIMATELY A YEAR BEFORE FAILING AGAIN.  EACH PART REPLACEMENT WAS IDENTICAL TO THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT.  THE MOST RECENT FAILURE OCCURRED JUST AFTER THE CAR WENT OUT OF THE 3-YEAR WARRANTY, AND BEFORE THE 36,000 MILE EXPIRED.  I HELD OFF REPLACING IT BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.  RECENTLY, I NARROWLY AVERTED AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BY MY DEFECTIVE VISOR.  IT WOULD NOT STAY UP AGAINST THE ROOF, FLOPPING DOWN 100% OF THE TIME, WHICH CAUSED ME TO MISS SEEING A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND TO ENTER AN INTERSECTION AFTER A TRAFFIC SIGNAL TURNED RED.  LUCKILY, THE DRIVER CROSSING FROM MY RIGHT WAS ABLE TO SEE ME AND TO COME TO A STOP IN TIME.  BUT I KNEW I COULD NOT DELAY REPLACING THE VISOR.  A NEW VISOR COST ME CLOSE TO $70.  THERE WAS NO AFTERMARKET PRODUCT AVAILABLE AND I DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS TO INSTALL A NEW VISOR MYSELF.  I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND SEVERAL BLOGS:  WWW.USRECALLNEWS.COM AND WWW.CIVICFORUMS.COM AND WWW.HONDA-TECH.COM, FILLED WITH COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER HONDA OWNERS HAVING IDENTICAL PROBLEMS.  ALL REPORTED THE SAME THING:  HONDA WILL NOT FIX THEM FREE OF CHARGE AFTER THE WARRANTY.  AND THERE HAS BEEN NO REDESIGN OF THE PART.  THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE ITEM TO HAVE TO REPLACE ONCE A YEAR (ON AVERAGE), AND IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE WITH A DEFECTIVE VISOR.

THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE BY ITSELF WHILE MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE CAR FROM PROCEEDING INTO THE INTERSECTION, I HAD TO APPLY BOTH FEET HEAVILY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS CROSSING THE STREET IN FRONT OF MY CAR AT THE TIME. AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY HONDA DEALER TO INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM. SINCE THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR ANYTIME DURING THE SERVICE TEST DRIVE, THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG THAT WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO ACCELERATE UNEXPECTEDLY.  IN A SECOND SIMILAR INCIDENT, I WAS STOPPED WAITING TO EXIT A COMMERCIAL PARKING LOT ONTO A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE.  AGAIN, THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE FIERCELY.  THIS TIME I WAS UNABLE TO HOLD BACK THE CAR WITH BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE.  IN A PANIC, FEARING I WOULD HIT SOMEONE CROSSING IN FRONT OF MY PATH, I ATTEMPTED TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO PARK OR REVERSE JUST TO STOP IT FROM CONTINUING FORWARD.  THE LATEST INCIDENT OCCURRED ON 10/3/09 WHILE BRAKED AT A CORNER INTERSECTION WAITING FOR TRAFFIC TO CLEAR DOWN THE BLOCK WHERE I WANTED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN.  THIS TIME WHILE MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE AND I PROCEEDED SLOWLY TO TURN THE CORNER, THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE UNEXPECTEDLY.  THIS OCCURRED WHILE ANOTHER CAR WAS PROCEEDING DOWN THE BLOCK TOWARDS ME.  WITH BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE, I WAS UNABLE TO HOLD BACK THE CAR AS I PROCEED AROUND THE CORNER.  AS MY CAR CONTINUED TO RACE FORWARD, I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO MANEUVER AROUND THE OTHER CAR WITHOUT STRIKING IT HEAD ON.  THESE UNEXPECTED ACCELERATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY TERRIFYING EXPERIENCES AND IT IS EVEN MORE UPSETTING TO LEARN FROM THE DEALER THAT THIS PROBLEM CANNOT BE EXPLAINED OR REPAIRED.

THIS SCREW BREAKING IN TWO PIECES HAPPENED DURING NORMAL USE.THERE IS NO KEY RELEASE SYSTEM TO LOWER THE BACK SUPPORT SECTION OF THE REAR SEATS NOR IS THERE A REAR LOCK TO ENTER THE TRUNK.SO,TO FIX THE PROBLEM ,MY MECHANIC HAD TO REMOVE ENOUGH BOLTS TO ENTER FROM BEHIND THE REAR SEAT. HAD A CHILD BEEN LOCKED IN THE TRUNK,IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST AN HOUR TO EXTRACATE HIM OR HER. THANK-YOU! *TR",

THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE TIE ROD BREAKING ON MY 2006 HONDA CIVIC AS I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET AT 25 MILES PER HOUR. THE MECHANICAL FAILURE CAUSED MY CAR TO VEER INTO 2 PARKED CARS CAUSING MINOR DAMAGE TO EACH.  THE ATTENDING OFFICER STATED THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE RESULT OF A MECHANICAL FAILURE AND DID NOT ISSUE ANY TICKETS. THE BODY SHOP OWNER ALSO AGREED THAT A MECHANICAL FAILURE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.   THIS PROMPTED ME TO INFORM HONDA OF AMERICA OF THE ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THE BROKEN TIE ROD. HONDA'S RESPONSE WAS YOU WILL BE CONTACTED IN 2 TO 3 WEEKS. IN THE MEAN TIME THE CAR WAS NOT FIXED AS EVERYTHING WAS ON HOLD WAITING FOR HONDA'S RESPONSE. IN FACT THE CAR WAS NOT FIXED UNTIL 7/24/08, 43 DAYS LATER. CONTACT WAS MADE BY CHRISTIAN K. SKJERVOLD OF M.A. JORDAN CO. INC. LOCATED IN MINNEAPOLIS MN. MR. SKJERVOLD VISIT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT. HIS ONLY OBJECTIVE WAS TO BADGER ME INTO ADMITTING THAT I HAD SOMEHOW BROKEN THE TIE ROD MYSELF. I AM 81 YEARS OLD AND DRIVE QUITE CONSERVATIVELY. HE SUGGESTED REPEATEDLY THAT PERHAPS I HAD BEEN DRIVING RECKLESSLY AND DAMAGED THE CAR BEFORE HAND. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD BE IN CONTACT IN 2 WEEKS. I HEARD NOTHING UNTIL I CONTACTED HIM IN LATE SEPTEMBER. A WEEK LATER I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HONDA STATING THAT BASED ON THEIR INVESTIGATION THE TIE ROD HAD BROKEN AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT CONTRADICTING ALL OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE LETTER GOES ON TO STATE THAT TIE ROD WAS NOT BROKEN BUT WAS BENT IN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS PURE FABRICATION AND I HAVE ALL OF THE BROKEN PARTS IN MY GARAGE TO PROVE IT.  IF THIS IS THE WAY HONDA HANDLES THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM I WILL ASSUME YOU HAVE A FILE ON THEM ALREADY. PLEASE ADD THIS TO YOUR DATA BASE.

HALF OF THE FRONT BUMPER CAME LOOSE FROM THE FRAME AND FELL DOWN AND STRUCK THE PAVEMENT, THEN BEGAN BOUNCING UP AND DOWN, TEARING THINGS UP.  LOUD NOISE LIKE PIECE OF TIRE FLAPPING IN WHEEL WELL.  WE STOPPED AND INVESTIGATED THE DAMAGE.  COULD NOT DRIVE OVER 35 MPH TO THE NEXT TOWN, SOME 20 MILES AWAY.  REACHED TOWN AND BOUGHT AND USED DUCT TAPE TO HOLD THE FENDER UP OFF THE GROUND SO WE COULD DRIVE HOME.    WE THEN TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL HONDA DEALER.  WE WERE TOLD THE UNDERNEATH PLASTIC CLIPS AND OTHER COMPONENTS WERE DAMAGED AND THAT THE CAR MUST HAVE BEEN RUN INTO A CURB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  I INVESTIGATED FURTHER, AS I KNEW THAT THE CAR HAD NEVER HIT A CURB.  IT HAS, HOWEVER, MADE SCRAPING NOISES WHEN PASSING OVER A TYPICAL PARKING LOT WHEEL STOP.  IN MY JUDGMENT, THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSE BY THE FACT THAT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE DOES NOT CLEAR WHEEL STOPS, AND HITTING WHEEL STOPS HAS SEVERELY DAMAGED THE PLASTIC COMPONENTS UNDER THE FRONT END, RESULTING IN THE BUMPER FALLING OFF AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  HAD BOTH SIDES OF THE BUMPER COME LOOSE, I WOULD HAVE RUN OVER THE BUMPER, PROBABLY LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND BECOMING INVOLVED IN A WRECK.  LOOKING UNDER THE VEHICLE, YOU CAN SEE THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY SCRAPING OVER PARKING LOT WHEEL STOPS.  WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE SURVIVED.  I CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE: 1) WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED; 2) PARKING WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST A WHEEL STOP IN A PARKING LOT IS A NORMAL PRACTICE AND IS NOT SOMETHING ONE WOULD NORMALLY WORRY ABOUT.

THE ONLY COMMENT FROM HONDA OF AMERICA WAS THAT IT WAS NOT A \"DEFECT\", NO CAUSE WAS GIVEN BY ANY HONDA ASSOCIATE AT ANY TIME. THE REPAIR SHOP (TERRY'S IN FRANKFORT IL), WAS VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE RELOADING THE AIR BAGS WAS NOT AN ISSUE, BUT KNOWING WHETHER THE CAUSE WAS RESOLVED WAS AN ISSUE WITH THEM.

WHEN THOSE AIR BAGS DEPLOY, THE NOISE IS DEAFENING, THE CAR FILLS WITH GAS AND IN MY CASE - BECAUSE MY ARM WAS ON THE ARM REST, THE BACK OF THE SEAT GIVES YOUR ARM A VERY PAINFUL WHACK.

THE DEALER HAD TO INSTALL A BRAND NEW ENGINE BLOCK, CYLINDER HEAD, NEW SPARK PLUGS, NEW TIMING CHAIN AND OTHER PARTS.  THE COST WAS OVER $6000!  IT HAD ONLY 80,000 MILES ON IT AND WAS 27 MONTHS OLD.  I AVERAGE 100 MILES PER DAY TO GET TO AND FROM WORK VIA THE FREEWAY, 3000 MILES PER MONTH, 36,000 MILES PER YEAR.  I HAD THE INTERMEDIATE SERVICE DONE AT 47000 MILES AND ANOTHER ONE AT 70000.

AN WARNING LIGHT CAME ON DUE TO IMA PROBLEMS, AND SOME COMPONENTS OF THE IMA COMPUTER AND CONTROL SYSTEM WERE REPLACED (I AM NOT SURE IF ANY OF THE OLD PARTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE).  SINCE THAT TIME, THE IMA BATTERY THAT POWERS THE ASSIST MOTOR HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE.  IT SOMETIMES WOULD FULLY DISCHARGE, AND THE CAR WOULD RUN ONLY ON THE UNDERPOWERED 1.3 L GAS ENGINE.  THE CAR IS VERY SLUGGISH, CAUSING SAFETY ISSUES WHEN ACCELERATION IS NEEDED IN CITY OR INTERSTATE DRIVING.  THE PROBLEM IS WORSE IN WARMER WEATHER, 85 DEGREES OR HIGHER.    SINCE THE PROBLEM FIRST WAS OBSERVED IN EARLY OCTOBER 2007, SOME PARTS AND COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP.  ON OCTOBER 29, 2007 THEY REPLACED THE MCM RELAY AND THE BATTERY CONTROL UNIT.  AROUND JULY 9, 2008 THE ORIGINAL IMA BATTERY WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW EXPERIMENTAL IMA BATTERY.  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2008 THE OXYGEN SENSOR WAS REPLACED AT THE SUGGESTION OF ANOTHER CIVIC HYBRID OWNER WHO THOUGHT THAT REPLACING THE SENSOR ON HIS CIVIC HAD HELPED SOME OF THE ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.  HOWEVER THE SERVICE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP ADMITTED TO ME THAT AMERICAN HONDA CANNOT FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT MY CAR HAS.  HE TELLS ME THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO A CHANGE IN PROGRAMMING OF THE SOFTWARE THAT CONTROLS THE IMA, A PROBLEM THAT STARTED WITH THE SOFTWARE UPDATES INSTALLED ON MY CAR IN OCTOBER, 2007.  HE SAYS THAT HONDA IS WORKING ON A NEW SOFTWARE UPDATE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS, BUT NO ONE HAS AN IDEA OF WHEN IT WILL BE AVAILABLE.  THE ONLY SUGGESTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME WAS \"WHEN YOU RUN THE AIR CONDITIONING, DIRECT THE VENTS UPWARDS TOWARD THE CEILING TO SEND THE COLD AIR BACK TOWARD THE IMA BATTERY\".

I WAS STOPPED AND THEN AS TRAFFIC STARTED MOVING FORWARD, I TAPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR OF MY HONDA CIVIC HYBRID 2006, AND INSTEAD OF SLIGHTLY MOVING FORWARD, MY CAR SURGED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AT A HIGH ACCELERATION-I DID NOT SEE THE EXACT DEGREE ON MY DASH, BUT HEARD THE ENGINE REVVING LOUDLY. I NOTICED THIS (TO GREATER OR LESSER DEGREES) A HANDFUL OF TIMES AFTER OWNING THE CAR FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES, THE ACCELERATION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS GREAT AND/OR I HAD A MUCH SAFER DISTANCE BETWEEN CARS AND I HAD TIME TO PUT ON THE BRAKES.  WHEN THIS HAPPENED I THOUGHT, I BOUGHT A HYBRID-LEMON AND HONDA WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS-BUT I FOUND SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ONLINE AND OTHER REPORTS THAT HONDA WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

THERE WAS NO WARRANTY PROTECTION FOR THIS YEAR-OLD PART!  I THEN SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP. RELUCTANTLY, THE DEALER ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY 2006 CIVIC THAT HAD SEEN THIS KIND OF DAMAGE.  A LITTLE INVESTIGATION ON GOOGLE REVEALED THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON PROBLEM:  HONDA'S DESIGN PUTS THE FRAGILE ALUMINUM AC CONDENSER IN A LOCATION THAT CAN EASILY RECEIVE DAMAGE.  THERE IS NO ROCK SHIELD OR ANY OTHER GUARD TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  THIS IS A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW, ONE THAT MUST BE PROTECTED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT EVEN IF HE MADE THE REPAIR, ANOTHER ROCK WOULD INEVITABLY HIT THE CONDENSER WITHOUT A SHIELD AND I'D END UP PAYING $780 ALL OVER AGAIN.  THE CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY; HONDA HAS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD PROTECT ITS CUSTOMERS.  THE DEALER SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  I CALLED THE HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE TO FILE A COMPLAINT.

THE CONDENSER, MADE OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MATERIAL AS ALUMINUM FOIL AND ACTUALLY ALUMINUM, IS COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED. THE PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC  IS WIDESPREAD AND ACROSS NEW HONDA MODELS. IF A SMALL PEBBLE OR ANY OTHER TINY HARD ELEMENT HAPPENS TO STRIKE THE COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED CONDENSER IT KNOCKS A NEARLY INVISIBLE (WE CAN'T SEE IT) HOLE IN IT, WHICH IN TURN KNOCKS OUT ALL A/C. I EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS A POOR DESIGN TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTION FOR THIS PART. THE PERSON SAID, YES, THEY UNDERSTAND BUT CAN DO NOTHING TO HELP AND THAT THEY SEE THIS EVERY WEEK. I WAS TOLD TO CALL HONDAS CONSUMER COMPLAINT LINE, WHICH I DID, AND WAS TOLD THE SAME STORY AND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING INTO FIXING IT FOR FUTURE MODELS. THEY ALL TOLD ME TO CLAIM IT ON INSURANCE, THAT IT IS A ROAD HAZARD PROBLEM. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A DESIGN PROBLEM, AND HAD I KNOWN ABOUT IT I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A TOYOTA. DEDUCTIBLE ON MY INSURANCE IS $500.00 AND THE COST TO FIX IS $600.00, IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE TO CLAIM IT AND TAKE THE HIT ON INSURANCE COSTS. HONDA NOT ONLY WILL NOT DISCUSS ANY ASSISTANCE FOR THE PRESENT PROBLEM, BUT OFFERS NO FIX TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.  IF I HAVE THIS REPAIRED TOMORROW IT COULD BE KNOCKED OUT AGAIN NEXT WEEK. *JB",

THE NOISE STARTED OUT BARELY AUDIBLE AND HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE WITH MORE MILES. WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO TWO HONDA DEALERSHIPS BEFORE IT HAD 6000 MILES ON IT AND THEY TOLD US THAT IT WAS JUST NORMAL TIRE NOISE. AFTER MORE COMPLAINING THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS OUR FAULT, BECAUSE WE DID NOT ROTATE THE TIRES FREQUENTLY ENOUGH.  WHEN I POINTED OUT TO THEM THAT THEY BALANCED AND ROTATED THE TIRES PRIOR TO THE REQUIRED PERIOD OUTLINED IN THE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE RECORDS THE STORY CHANGED AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE NOW HAS 19000 MILES ON IT AND THE NOISE IS HORRIBLE AND THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP NOW SAYS THE REAR TWO TIRES HAVE SEPARATED BELTS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE MUST HAVE HIT A POTHOLE OR ROAD DEBRIS.  I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW I COULD HAVE HIT A POTHOLE OR ROAD DEBRIS WITH JUST TWO TIRES, BECAUSE LAST TIME I CHECKED THE FRONT TIRES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE REAR TIRES.      I HAVE ALSO BROUGHT THIS CAR TO A BRIDGESTONE DEALER, WHICH IS THE MAKE OF THE TIRES, AND HE SAID THE TIRES WERE CUPPED DUE TO THE CAR BEING OUT OF ALIGNMENT. I THEN CALLED THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT LINE ON THE TIRE WARRANTY PAMPHLET FOR BRIDGESTONE AND WAS INFORMED THAT THIS WAS A VEHICLE ISSUE.      I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS BECOMING A SAFETY ISSUE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM OTHER THAN BEING NOISY.  I HAVE RECEIVED NO HELP FROM HONDA OR BRIDGESTONE IN THIS MATTER OTHER THAN A BUNCH OF FINGERPRINTING AND THE OFFER TO SELL ME NEW SET OF TIRES AT A COST OF OVER $600.  EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE TIRES HAVE A PROBLEM AND ARE THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO ADMIT RESPONSIBILITY FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  *NM",
