That morning, the Hyundai Tucson in front of us stopped short and we ran into the back of it doing around 35 an hour, and ended up with our vehicle (Subaru Impreza) being totaled. I\u2019d like to provide pictures to show the impact, as even car experts have been surprised that the airbags didn\u2019t deploy. As it turns out, a sedan hitting into the back of an SUV means that the airbag sensors may be untouched (because they\u2019re too low) and therefore, airbags will not deploy, even if the accident severe. To me, that is a defect in the design and should be reconsidered going forward. My fianc\u00e9 broke his foot , which caused him to be out of work for at least 4 months and I got whiplash.",

A weld to attach the head of the  bolt to the body of the bolt (i.e., Part# 753-0242-06)  failed and the head separated from  the body of the bolt . This  failure of one bolt made the connection by the front roof rack assembly unit to the front roof cross bar loose, which resulted in the entire bike rook rack being only loosely connected to the roof cross bars and unstable.

Initially, I believed the truck behind me had pushed my car causing the brake pedal to lock. I contacted the police and we examined my vehicle. There was no damage from the impact on the front of my car and there was no evidence I had been rearended. Two Subaru shops have examined the vehicle. One theory from the first shop is that an object in the road lifted the car off the road and caused the pedal to fail. The other shop has no theories. Neither shop found any issue with the brakes or the pedal and could not recreate the problem. Extensive repairs have been done to correct damage from a large rock in the road. The Subaru shop doing the repairs said the rock damage would not have affected the brakes. The car can be inspected at any time. My family is wary of driving the vehicle.
