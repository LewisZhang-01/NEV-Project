THE NEXT DAY I WENT BACK AND TOOK PICTURES OF THAT AREA AND A VIDEO.THIS WAS BY A GUARDRAIL WITH A HUGE DROP OFF ON THE SIDE.

FOUND OUT FROM A REPAIR SHOP THAT THIS MODEL, ESPECIALLY THE 2003 IS KNOWN FOR TRANSMISSION, SHODDY PARTS, AND IS A SAFETY HAZARD! THE PUMP INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION BROKE. THIS CAR CAME WITH 124,000 MILES AND OVER 2 YEARS, SPENT $4,000.00 ON TOP OF THE USED PRIVATE PURCHASE OF $2,400.00. CAR REPAIR SHOP WANTS $2,400 (WHAT I PAID FOR IT) TO PUT A NEW TRANSMISSION IN.

I WAS 8 MONTHS PREGNANT AT THE TIME AND WAS STRANDED AT THE STORE WITH MY DAUGHTER LOCKED IN THE CAR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.  AND THEN, ON MAY 27TH 2011, I WENT TO LEAVE MY HOUSE AND I USUALLY KEEP THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW DOWN BECAUSE THE ONLY DOORS THAT WE CAN OPEN ARE THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND FRONT PASSENGER DOOR AND ONLY FROM THE INSIDE. BUT ON THIS DAY IT HAD RAINED SO I PUT THE WINDOW UP AND WHEN I WENT TO LEAVE MY HOUSE I HAD ALREADY WENT OUTSIDE AND WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE \"PROCEDURE\" OF GETTING THE BACK DOOR OPENED SO I COULD PUT MY 3 MONTH OLD SON IN THE CAR AND I GUESS WHEN I WENT BACK INSIDE TO GET HIM, THE DRIVERS DOOR GOT BLOWN CLOSED BY THE WIND, BECAUSE WHENEVER I PUT HIM IN AND SHUT HIS DOOR, I WENT AROUND TO THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND IT WAS SHUT AND MY 3 MONTH OLD WAS STUCK IN THE CAR!! IT TOOK 30 MINUTES FOR MY HUSBAND TO GET TO THE HOUSE (BECAUSE I HAD TO CALL HIM HOME FROM WORK) AND HE HAD TO CLIMB IN THROUGH THE TRUNK AND MANOVER THE CARSEAT OUT OF THE WAY SO HE COULD WIGGLE IN THERE AND GET THE BABY OUT.  MY SON WAS COVERED IN SWEAT FROM HEAD TO TOE AND WAS HAVING A HARD TIME BREATHING WHENEVER WE GOT HIM OUT BECAUSE HE ALREADY HAS BREATHING PROBLEMS AND HE WAS IN THE CAR WITH ALL OF THE WINDOWS UP FOR 30 MINUTES.

FROM MY RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, MANY OTHER FORD FOCUS OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE AND THE FIX HAS BEEN TO REPLACE IGNITION SWITCH (SOMETHING ABOUT TUMBLERS NOT ENGAGING) AND THE FORD SERVICE TEAMS ARE VERY AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND THE REPAIRS.  WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY CONSUMERS MUST PAY FOR A WIDE REACHING MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. *TR",

OF COURSE, FIRST THING I DID WAS GO TO FORD TO SEE IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THE IGNITION AND FOUND OUT NO, THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS STUPID CAR PART!!!  THE FORD DEALERSHIP SAID IT WOULD COST ME PROBABLY BETWEEN $300 AND $500 TO FIX IT!!!! AND IT'S A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT!!!!!

THIS IS THE SAME SPARK PLUG THAT BLEW OUT AT 108,411 MILES.  WE HAVE CONTACTED MANY MECHANICS TO SEE WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE.

THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION OR THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.  IF THIS CAR EVER ACTUALLY GETS FIXED, I WILL CERTAINLY NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT AS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR IS UNRELIABLE AND THERE IS NO TELLING WHEN IT WILL SUDDENLY QUIT WORKING AGAIN. *TR",

AFTER CALLING A FEW LOCAL DEALERSHIPS/REPAIR SHOPS, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE WINDOW(S) HAD PROBABLY COME \"OFF TRACK\" BUT THEY COULD NOT BE CERTAIN WITHOUT INSPECTION.

HE WASN'T ABLE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AT THE TIME, BUT HE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AS HE HAD RAN ACROSS IT NUMEROUS TIMES. HE STATED THAT BOTH REGULATORS FOR THE WINDOW MOTOR'S HAD FAILED & ESTIMATED THE REPAIR COST TO BETWEEN $500-$600.00 !

WHEN I INSERTED MY KEY I FOUND THAT IT WOULD NOT TURN AT ALL AND THE STEERING COLUMN HAD LOCKED UP AS WELL. LEAVING ME STRANDED, I CALLED A TOW TRUCK WHO TOWED MY CAR TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP IN WHICH I PURCHASED MY CAR. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TOLD ME I WAS THE FOURTH FOCUS HE HAD TOWED THAT WEEK WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. THIS HAPPENED ON A FRIDAY NIGHT, SO I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY MORNING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG AND GET MY CAR BACK. THIS LEFT ME STRANDED ALL WEEKEND, WHICH MEANT I MISSED WORK ALL WEEKEND.  I AM VERY UPSET THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR THIS TO BE FIXED ON MY CAR, ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THESE FAULTY IGNITION SWITCHES FOR YEARS. MY MAIN CONCERN FOR THIS PROBLEM AND REASON I AM SO UPSET IS THAT FORD HAS SAID THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE AND WILL NOT ISSUE A RECALL ON THE PROBLEM. I SAY TO THEM THAT THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM. WHAT IF YOUR CAR STALLS OUT ON TRAIN TRACKS AND YOU CAN'T GET IT TO START UP AGAIN? I THINK THAT WOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE.  WHAT ABOUT IF YOU LIVE NEAR THE COAST AND YOU HAVE TO EVACUATE DUE TO A HURRICANE OR SOME OTHER NATURAL DISASTER?  WHAT IF THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED TO SOMEONE IN NEW ORLEANS DURING KATRINA? ARE YOU GOING TO TELL THEM IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE?  ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO COME AND DRILL OUT THE IGNITION CYLINDER BEFORE THEY CAN EVACUATE?

I ASKED WHY IT WAS NOT RECALLED OR COVERED, AS THERE WERE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS PIECE, AND SHE HAD NO ANSWER. I HAD TO GET TOWED, WHICH CAUSED DAMAGE TO MY CAR, THEN WAS INFORMED THAT THIS WORK WOULD COST OVER 200$ TO FIX THE PROBLEM, WITH ONLY A 1 YEAR WARRANTY ON THE PART. WHEN ASKED, THE TECH WHO WORKED ON MY CAR INFORMED ME THAT THE SAME PIECE WOULD PROBABLY GO OUT AGAIN, AND AGAIN, OVER THE COURSE OF MY OWNERSHIP. I AM NOW SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING TRADING IN THIS CAR.

THE FOLLOWING DAY, I SPENT SOME TIME ON THE TELEPHONE WITH SEVERAL MECHANICS AND KEY MAKERS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A FAULTY IGNITION CYLINDER.  ON APRIL 14 I HAD THE CAR TOWED INTO BOHN FORD INC. AT 401 N. CARROLLTON AVENUE, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70119.  (504) 485-2646.    WHILE THE CAR WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP, I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND LEARNED FROM ONE WEBSITE THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST 137 OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD.  I FOUND A SECOND WEBSITE WITH ANOTHER LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SHARING THEIR EXPERIENCES OF THE FAULTY IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK.  TWO PEOPLE WHO POSTED ONTO THE WEBSITE MENTIONED THE PO5.   I UNDERSTOOD FROM THEM THAT THE CAR COULD HAVE BEEN FIXED FOR $24.58.  THE CAR HAD TO BE UNDER SIX YEARS OLD AND UNDER 75,000 MILES.    THE STAFF AT THE BOHN FORD DEALERSHIP WAS VERY CONSIDERATE AND UNDERSTANDING OF MY SITUATION; HOWEVER, WHEN I REQUESTED A PO5, THEY TOLD ME THAT WHILE THEY WERE SURE THAT I QUALIFIED , THEIR OFFICE WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO APPLY FOR A PO5 AT THIS TIME.  MY TOTAL BILL CAME TO $396.69 TO DRILL OUT, CODE, AND REPLACE THE IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK; AND TO CUT, ERASE, AND PROGRAM TWO PAT KEYS.  THE IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK PROBLEM ON THE FORD FOCUS CAN BE TRACED AT LEAST AS FAR BACK AS 2001.  THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO BEGIN A RECALL ON THE IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK.  *JB",

FOR FIVE MONTH I OWN THIS VEHICLE, I WAS IN THE SHOP FOR ALL KIND DIFFERENT PROBLEMS 9 TIMES.  IT WAS: CONSTANT VERY STRONG VIBRATION WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED, CONSTANT GROUNDING NOISE COMES FROM ENGINE SITE AND TRANSFORMED TO AN ULTRASOUND NOISE AT HIRE SPEED, THE SQUEALING HAS INTENSIFIED AND SOUNDS HORRIBLE!  TRANSMISSION LOCKED UP WHILE I DROVE ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH, HAD TO USE TOW TRACK.( DEALER SAD THEY \u001cCANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM\u001d) ,BUT TRANSMISSION STILL LOCKS AND JERKING CONSTANTLY, SQUEAL NOISE FROM BREAKS, (DEALER REPLACED FRONT PADS AND RESURFACE DRUM, BUT REFUSED TO REPAIR REAR BREAKS AND NOISE AND PULSATION IS STILL THERE., DEALER FOUND DEFECTIVE RIMS, DEFECTIVE TIRES, THROTTLE PROBLEMS, BRAKES PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR INTENSIFIED. I GOT MY CRUSE CONTROL ACCELERATED BY IT SELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY, TRANSMISSION LOCKS UP AND JERKING INTERMITTENTLY, BRAKES SQUEALING AND PULSATE     THE FORD DEALER SALES AND SERVICE PEOPLE SAID THAT I SHOULD NOT RETURN FOR SERVICE AND WAIST ANY BODY\u0019S TIME, HE SAID THAT WHAT I HEAR AND FILL IN MY FORD FOCUS  IS  \u001cNORMAL\u001d.   FORD WARRANTY IS NOT WORTH A PAPER IT IS WRITTEN ON.  SO, FORD WON\u0019T FIX MY CAR AND I CANNOT DO IT OTHER WISE.  AS A RESULT OF STRONG VIBRATION AND SQUEALING NOISE I AM LOOSING BALANCE, HAVE SEVERE HEADACHE, ALL BODY EKING, I HAVE PAIN IN BOOTH OF MY ARMS, AND I HAVE DIFFICULTY TO WALK AND MY RIGHT LEG BECOME NUM. I HAVE TO USE WALKING CANE AND KNEE AND ANKLE SUPPORT.   I SCARED TO EVEN DRIVE IT ANYMORE.

ON SUNDAY MORNING, I WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 50MPH WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKE DUE TO THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS OF THE MOMENT.  INSTANTLY, THE BACK END OF THE CAR SWERVED TO THE RIGHT IN A JACK-KNIFE MANNER.  THE CAR SPUN AROUND AND THREW ITSELF ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  THE FRONT END WOUND UP POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  FORTUNATELY THE CAR LANDED IN A SANDY SPOT WITH NO DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE OR TO ME.  IT WAS AS IF I HAD HIT BLACK ICE, EXCEPT THAT DRIVING CONDITIONS THAT DAY WERE PERFECT - 50 DEGREES, SUNNY AND DRY WITH GOOD ROAD SURFACE.  IN MY OPINION, THIS INCIDENT MAY BE THE RESULT OF POOR DESIGN:  THAT IS THE REAR END OF THE FOCUS SE WAGON IS TOO LIGHT TO HOLD THE ROAD WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, OR THE BRAKES FAILED, CAUSING THE CAR TO SPIN.  IN ANY EVENT, THIS WAS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE FOR ME.  I THINK THAT THIS CAR IS A DEATH TRAP FOR ME AND A HAZARD FOR EVERYONE ELSE NEAR IT ON THE ROAD.  *AK",

THE INDIVIDUAL SAID FORD CLAIMED IT WAS DUE TO WELDING IRREGULARITIES AND SUCH. WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT FORD, HE CLAIMED THAT THE 2003 FORD FOCUS REAR DEFROSTER WAS CHANGED AND THEY HAD GIVEN IT A HIGHER AMP TO MAKE IT HOTTER. SINCE IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 6 DGREES OUTSIDE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN HOT AND SHATTERED WHEN COOLING QUICKLY - HE DID NOT KNOW AND WAS JUST SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS. REGARDLESS, THE AUTO HAD 440 MILES ON IT AND WAS ONLY ABOUT 10 DAYS OLD WHEN THIS OCCURRED.

I BEGAN PUMPING THE GAS PEDAL, BUT THE MOTOR JUST REVVED.  IT WAS AS THOUGH MY CAR HAD SLIPPED INTO NEUTRAL.  I GLANCED DOWN AT THE AUTOMATIC SHIFT LEVER, TO SEE IF I HAD ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED IT OUT OF GEAR.  IT WAS STILL IN DRIVE.  I BEGAN LOSING SPEED AND HAD TO COAST DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GRADE, WHERE THERE WAS PARKING ACCESSIBILITY.

I RECEIVED A PHONE MESSAGE FRIDAY EVENING, AFTER WORK, AND I WAS TOLD THE CAR HAS CHECKED OUT FINE.  I HAD ASSUMED THIS WOULD HAPPEN, BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS SO INTERMITTENT.  THE SERVICE ATTENDANT, MIKE BRUNI, STATED HE HAD DOCUMENTED THE PROBLEM AND I COULD PICK UP MY CAR.  I LEFT A MESSAGE ON HIS VOICEMAIL, EXPLAINING MY FEAR OF A COLLISION.

AS SOON AS WE GOT THERE, WE WERE TOLD TO BRING THE CAR TO THE SERVICE AREA, AND ROBERT ENRIQUES, THE SERVICE ADVISOR EXAMINED THE CAR, AND WENT THROUGH THE LIST OF PROBLEMS ABOUT THE CAR.   HE DID SAY THE RUST ON THE MUFFLER IS JUST \"SURFACE\" RUST, BUT THE OTHER RUST IS \"MORE THAN SURFACE RUST\".  I ASKED HIM WHY FORD SELLS CARS WITH RUST IN IT.  HE JUST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID NOTHING.  I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T WANT THE CAR ANYMORE, SO I ASKED TO SEE THE GM.  ROBERT SAID HE'LL GET THE GM, BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER, THE ASST. MGR CAME TO TALK TO US.  BASICALLY, JAY CONFIRMED WHAT ROBERT ALREADY TOLD US, AND TRULY EMPHASIZED THAT THE CAR DOES HAVE SERIOUS RUST ON THE FRAME, AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST IMAGINING IT!   IT IS NOT JUST SURFACE RUST!ROBERT ENRIQUES TOOK PICTURES OF THE RUST AND SENT THEM TO DIGITAL IMAGING.  ROBERT TOLD ME THAT MANUFACTURER WON'T TAKE THE CAR BACK.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE FORD SERVICE REP WILL BE HERE IN HAWAII ON 9/8, AND HE'LL SHOW THE PICTURES TO HIM THEN AND DECISION WILL BE MADE.  I FINALLY GOT TO TALK TO THE GM (8/27), AND TOLD HIM ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH  THE CAR.  HE SAID HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE RUST, AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF, BUT THEY'RE ALL MINOR PROBLEMS.  I DON'T THINK THEY ARE!  NOT ON A BRAND NEW CAR!
