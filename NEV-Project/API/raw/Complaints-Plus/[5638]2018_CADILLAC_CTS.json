FELT LIKE IT COULD BE A TRANSMISSION OR A ENGINE MISFIRE. MY CARS TRANSMISSION ALSO SHIFTS VERY VERY ROUGH KINDLY JERKY WHICH CREATES A UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT WHILE IN MOTION.  THIS IS A CONSISTENT ISSUE AND WITH MY CAR AND ONLY HAVING 12,000 MILES ON IT I FIND REALLY CONCERNING. THIS VIBRATION ONLY HAPPENS BETWEEN 50-60MPH AND THE ROUGH TRANSMISSION SHIFTING HAPPENS AS I DRIVE IT ALONG WITH VIBRATIONS ARE COMING FROM THE ENGINE WHICH SHAKE MY ENTIRE CAR. ALL SERVICES ARE UP TO DATE. CADILLAC AND GM ARE BOTH NOT SURE OF WHAT THE ISSUE CAN BE EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PENDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THE SAME ISSUE",
