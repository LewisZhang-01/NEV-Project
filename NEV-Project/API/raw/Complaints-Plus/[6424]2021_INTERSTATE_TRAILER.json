ANY BUMPS OR POTHOLES THAT CAUSE THE AXLE TO MOVE WILL SEVER THE WIRES AND REMOVE ALL TRAILER BRAKING.  I PURCHASED A NEW TRAILER ON 8/12/2020 AND THE BRAKES FAILED ON THE FIRST USE.  THE MAIN WIRE IS VISIBLY CRUSHED AND SEVERED REMOVING THE BRAKING CAPABILITY FROM BOTH AXLES.  THE PHOTO SHOWS THAT THE WIRING WAS FIXED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO BE ROUTED IN THIS LOCATION.*DT    CONSUMER SAYS THAT DAMAGED WIRES ARE LOCATED ON THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE WHEEL. HE SAYS THE CARGO ADDED WEIGHED WAS JUST UNDER 3500 LBS, WHICH IS L BELOW THE 7000 LB TRAILER RATING. THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER WERE MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. *DL",
