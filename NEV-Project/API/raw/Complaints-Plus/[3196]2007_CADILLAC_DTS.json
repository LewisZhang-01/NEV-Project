THERE IS ALSO A TSB ON THE ISSUE: HTTP://WWW.CADILLACFORUMS.COM/FORUMS/CADILLAC-DTS-FORUM-2006-THROUGH-2012/173283-TSB-FLICKERING-HEADLIGHTS.HTML AND PAGES OF THE NTSB FILINGS ABOUT THE HEADLAMPS ARE HERE HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CADILLAC/DTS/2006/LIGHTS/EXTERIOR_LIGHTING-3.SHTML    AFTER BEING STOPPED TWICE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR A HEADLAMP OUT, WE TOOK THE CAR TO RON CARTER CADILLAC IN HOUSTON, TEXAS WHERE WE WERE CHARGED ABOUT $850 TO REPLACE THE RIGHT FRONT BALLAST. THE LEFT ONE WAS ALSO JUST STARTING TO SHOW THE SAME PROBLEM SO I MADE THE CONTACT TO GM AND WAS WORKING WITH KIM. MY WIFE WAS JUST STOPPED THE OTHER DAY BY A POLICE OFFICER REGARDING THE LEFT LAMP.     KIM WAS GOING TO CONTACT RON CARTER CADILLAC AND HAVE THEM CONTACT ME REGARDING THE LEFT LAMP AND WORK OUT A DEAL ON IS REPLACEMENT. I ASSUME KIM DID HER JOB BUT RON CARTER HAS NEVER TO THIS DAY CALLED US REGARDING THE LEFT LAMP. THEY ALSO HAD NO INTEREST IN WORKING WITH GM ON THE ORIGINAL RIGHT HEADLIGHT ISSUE SAYING IT WAS 'THE CUSTOMER'S PROBLEM TO WORK WITH GM'.",
