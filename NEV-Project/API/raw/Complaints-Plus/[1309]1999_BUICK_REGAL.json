FLAMES WERE 20 FT HIGH. FIRE DEPT WAS CALLED BUT I WAS ABLE TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND WATER FROM MY GARDEN HOSE. WHEN THE FIRE DEPT ARRIVED THE FIRE WAS ALREADY OUT.  MY EVALUATION IS THE FOLLOWING: THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS SO GREAT THAT IT SPLIT OPEN/CRACKED THE UPPER INTAKE MANIFOLD (UPPER PLANUM). IT ALSO LIFTED THE FUEL RAIL FROM THE ENGINE AND SOME INJECTORS CAME LOOSE, FUEL THEN SPILLED ON THE ENGINE AND FIRE IMMEDIATELY ENSUED. THE PLASTIC FUEL LINES ALSO POPPED OFF THE FUEL INJECTORS RAIL, THIS SPILLED EVEN MORE FUEL AND FED THE FIRE EVEN MORE.  I CANNOT BELIEVE BUICK/GM USE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLDS (UPPER PLANUM) AND PLASTIC FUEL LINE INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. I BELIEVE IF THE MANIFOLD AND FUEL LINES HAD BEEN MADE OF METAL, THE EXPLOSION OR BACKFIRE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTAINED AND MINIMAL DAMAGE WITH NO FIRE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. THE FIRE CONSUMED THE PLASTIC FUEL LINE WHICH THEN SPILLED EVEN MORE FUEL ONTO THE ON GOING FIRE. I RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED THE SAME INCIDENT INVOLVING BUICK AND GM VEHICLES. I BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND DEFECTS THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.

BY THEN I WAS UP TO 60-65 MPH, I CALLED 911 STATED THE SITUATION, ASKING FOR HELP & TO HAVE SOMEONE ON THE PHONE JUST IN CASE. I ALMOST HIT A BUS, LOOKING AHEAD A FEW BLOCKS I SAW BACK-TO-BACK TRAFFIC STARTING TO BUILD-UP, I DID NOT WANT TO HURT MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE, THEN GOING 65-70 MPH I LOOKED OVER AND SAW A PARK I TURNED THE VAN INTO THE PARK & TO STOP IT I DECIDED TO CRUSHED THE VAN INTO A TREE. I TURNED TOWARD THE TREE AND JUMPED OUT; THE VAN CRASHED INTO THE SIDE OF THE TREE & CONTINUED TO KEEP GOING. I RAN AFTER IT AS I SAW THE VAN JUMP THE CURB AND GOING 70MPH TOWARDS THE ROW OF HOMES ACROSS THE STREET CRASHED INTO A TREE HEAD ON. THE VAN ENGINE AFTER ALL THAT CONTINUED TO ROAR AS IF TRYING TO KEEP GOING. I FLAGGED DOWN A VAN AND RECALLED THE POLICE TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE THE VAN HAD STOPPED. WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME & TURNED THE VAN OFF THEY TOLD ME THE VAN WAS ON FIRE & THEY  TOWED IT AWAY. THIS IS A BLESSING KNOW ONE WAS HURT, BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS, & FOR THE AUTO COMPANY NOT TO INVESTIGATE IS A TRAGEDY. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING NUMEROUS PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DIE, BEFORE THEY WILL ADMIT THERE MAYBE A PROBLEM, JUST TO SAVE MONEY? IF THAT IS THE CASE SHAME ON THEM. I AM HERE BY GRACE, BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK OF THOSE THIS SAME SITUATION MAY HAVE HAPPEN TO, BUT DID NOT LIVE TO SAY WHY OR HOW IT HAPPEN.

I WORK 6 DAYS A WEEK AND TAKING IT WAS GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME BUT I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN IT DONE IN THE PAST.  ANYWAY, I DROVE THE CAR 11 MILES FROM MY MOMS HOUSE TO MY HOUSE ON THE 1ST. AND WHEN I GOT HOME I CARRIED IN SOME GROCERIES AND SENT MY SON OUTSIDE TO GET THE REST.  HE CAME BACK IN YELLING THAT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE! MY HUSBAND WHO WAS HOME POPPED UP THE HOOD AND FLAMES WERE ABOUT A FOOT HIGH. I HAD PARKED RIGHT BY THE HOUSE AND HE GRABBED THE HOSE AND MY SONS SWEATSHIRT AND TOGETHER HE AND MY SON PUT THE FIRE OUT.  THE BURNED AREA IS RIGHT WHERE THE RECALL DESCRIBED THE FIRE COULD HAPPEN.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REFERRED ME TO THE BUICK RECALL LINE.  I CALLED THEM AND THEY TOOK MY INFO. 2 WEEKS LATER I GET A LETTER THAT SAYS MY \"WARRANTY CLAIM\" HAS BEEN DENIED.  I CALLED THE NUMBER BACK AT THE TOP OF THE LETTER BUT IT HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED! I CALLED THE RECALL LINE NUMBER BUT KEPT GETTING A VOICE MAIL AND NO RETURN CALLS BACK.  FINALLY ON 10/21 I CALLED THEM AND THEY AGAIN TOLD ME TO CALL THE NUMBER ON THE LETTER AND I SAID IS WAS NOT IN SERVICE AND THEY SAID THE NUMBER WAS PRINTED WRONG AND GAVE ME THE CORRECT NUMBER.  I CALLED AND THEY TOLD ME THAT \"THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED ON THE CAR AND THAT THEY WERE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO FIX IT AFTER THAT\", EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UNDER RECALL, THAT IT WAS MORE OF A \"SUGGESTION\" FOR REPAIR AND THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO REPAIR IT.  THEY SAID UNDER THE WARRANTY LAW, THEY WERE NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CAR....EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT A WARRANTY SITUATION!    THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN MOVED SINCE. *TR",

THIS FAILURE ONLY EFFECTED THE POWER ASSIST IN A LEFT HAND TURN; RIGHT WAS OK.   I PULLED INTO A PARKING SPOT AFTER A SHORT DRIVE TO WORK AND NOTICED THE STEERING GOT TIGHT. I HEARD A 'POP' WHEN I LOST ASSIST. AFTER WORK I DROVE HOME WITH NO ASSIST TO THE LEFT. THE PROBLEM IS ONLY WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED CLOCKWISE FROM STRAIGHT ON POSITION. I HAVEN'T DRIVEN A NON-POWER STEERING CAR IN ABOUT 15 YEARS BUT THIS SEEMED MUCH WORSE (VERY DIFFICULT TO STEER). I CHECKED FOR ANY TYPE OF LEAK OR BELT ISSUE, BUT MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS IF THAT WAS THE PROBLEM I WOULD HAVE THE PROBLEM REGARDLESS OF STEERING DIRECTION.  I HAVE SINCE SPOKE TO A DEALER REGARDING THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE CONFIDENT A REPLACEMENT OF THE STEERING RACK AND PINION IS REQUIRED.

SINCE THE WARRANTY ENDED LAST DECEMBER, I CALLED GM SPECIAL POLICY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM AND I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE CLOSEST LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED SO REPAIR REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS COULD BE DETERMINED FOR ANY POSSIBLE SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT.  I CALLED THE LOCAL SUN DEALER ON 9/4, BUT I WAS POLITELY TOLD DON?T COME HERE BECAUSE I DIDN?T BUY THE CAR THERE AND THEY DIDN?T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN ANY CROSS WARRANTY ISSUES (DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR THEIR TIME).

THE PRIVATE GARAGE REPLACED THE RUSTED & LEAKING BRAKE LINES, REAR ROTORS & BRAKE PADS FOR A TOTAL COST OF $412.31.  ALL REPLACED PARTS WERE GIVEN TO ME AT MY REQUEST.

I WAS TOLD VIA EMAIL BUICK?S GM SPECIAL POLICY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM WOULD FOLLOW UP.   ON 9/11 I SPOKE WITH A GM'S SPECIAL POLICY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM PERSON, EXPLAINED WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED AND WAS TOLD ONLY THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE SERVICING DEALER COULD APPROVE ANY REIMBURSEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY.  THEY WOULD NOTIFY HIM OF MY CLAIM.  ON 9/12 I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER (WHO SEEMED VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THE CAR?S LOW MILEAGE) BUT HE COULDN?T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE AREA SERVICE MANAGER?S APPROVAL.

THE BEAUTY OF THE BRITAX 161 WAS THAT IT WAS COMFORTABLE FOR CHILDREN AND EASY TO SEAT CHILDREN AND PROPERLY AND SAFELY ADJUST.  THE RECAL FIX CHANGES THE BASIC DESIGN.  BRITAX NEEDS TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE MODLED PARTS SO THAT CUSTOMERS HAVE THE SAFE, USABLE PRODUCT THEY PURCHASED, NOT THIS HALF BAKED CHEAP REDESIGN WHICH ALTHOUGH MAY BE SAFE IS NOT EASY TO USE, IS DISCOMFORTABLE FOR CHILDREN AND NOT THE HIGH END PRODUCT I BOUGHT.  A PROPER FIX IS ONE THAT IS TRANSPARENT TO THE USER.  IF I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY PINTO, A PROPER FIX IS NOT DRIVE A VEGA.*AK",
