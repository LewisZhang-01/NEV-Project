THERE IS ONLY THE \"MUTE\" BUTTON STUCK ON THE DASHBOARD AND THERE IS NO SOUND COMING FROM THE MMI SYSTEM AT ALL.  ALSO WHEN I TURN OFF THE VEHICLE YOU CAN HEAR THE PHONE BUSY SOUND COMING FROM INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE SOMEWHERE SO CLEARLY SOMETHING WAS WRONG. ONCE I GOT BACK HOME AND PARKED THE VEHICLE I DID A VISUAL INSPECTION AND FOUND THE REAR RIGHT AREA SOAKED WITH WATER , THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING SMELL AS IF SOMETHING ELECTRICAL HAD MELTED OR CAUGHT FIRE.  THE NEXT DAY I CONTINUED TO SMELL THIS FAINT BURNT WIRE SMELL WHICH DEFINITELY CONCERNED ME.  KEEP IN MIND MY AUDIO IS NO LONGER WORKING AT THIS POINT  AND HAS NOT RETURNED  I BEGAN TO REMOVE ALL THE ITEMS IN THE REAR LIFT GATE PORTION OF THE VEHICLE AND STARTED TO DISASSEMBLE THE REAR RIGHT SIDE TO INVESTIGATE IF IN FACT ANYTHING HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE OR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO SO. WHAT I FOUND WAS, THE BOSE AMPLIFIER WAS COMPLETELY DRENCHED AND OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS DOWN ON THAT SIDE WERE WET AS WELL IT LOOKS TO BE A BACKUP IN THE DRAIN TUBES. AFTER LOOKING ON MULTIPLE FORUMS ON THE INTERNET I FOUND THAT THIS IS REOCCURRING ISSUE WITH THIS PARTICULAR YEAR AND MODEL Q7 THAT AUDI IS WELL AWARE OF BUT SURPRISINGLY NO ONE HAS STARTED A CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THIS ISSUE ADDRESSED.  MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT IT CAN POTENTIALLY START A FIRE IN THE REAR DO TO THIS OBVIOUS DESIGN DEFECT AND ALSO MY ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY THIS DESIGN DEFECT.  PLEASE HELP!!!!!!
