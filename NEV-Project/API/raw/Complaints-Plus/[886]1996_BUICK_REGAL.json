THIS IS AN ON-GOING PROBLEM WITH THE 1996 BUICK REGAL.  THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FIRE AS INDICATED BY THE PREVIOUS RECALL NOTICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.   AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, THE FOLLOWING SERVICE WAS REQUIRED:  REPAIR ELECTRICAL FAILURE, CLEAN EXCESSIVE COOLANT FROM UPPER COMBUSTION CHAMBERS, REMOVE COOLANT FROM TOP END OF ENGINE, REPLACE UPPER INTAKE ASSEMBLE AND MANIFOLD, REPLACE SPARK PLUGS, PERFORM INJECTOR SERVICE, REPLACE THE PCV VALVE, OIL AND OIL FILTER.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, I WAS STILL CHARGED $557.17 FOR THE REPAIR.  DUE TO THE NUMEROUS SERVICE BULLETINS, CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, AND PREVIOUS RECALL NOTICE FOR THE SAME SITUATION, THIS DEFECT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED ON MARCH 7, 2002.  AT THAT TIME, I HAD THE ROUTINE 60,000 MILE SERVICE PERFORMED EVEN THOUGH THE CAR ONLY HAD 50,480 MILES.  THE TOTAL COST FOR THE ROUTINE SERVICE WAS $807.00.   FOR THESE REASONS, I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REIMBURSEMENT OF THE $557.01 CHARGE.  IF NEEDED, I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO FORWARD A COPY OF MY SERVICE RECORDS FOR YOUR REVIEW.
