BEING VERY WEARY OF THE TIRES FROM ALL THE REPORTS I HAD BEEN READING, I ALWAYS CHECK THE TIRE FOR WEAR AT EVERY STOP.     UPON ARRIVING IN HEBER CITY, UTAH WE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE TIRES (DRIVER-SIDE FRONT) WAS WEARING STRANGE. THE OUTER TREAD WAS WORN MORE THAN THE REST OF THE TIRE. WE MADE THE DECISION TO CONTINUE ON THE FINAL 200 MILES TO OUR DESTINATION. WE MADE SEVERAL STOPS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIRE WEAR. ONCE ARRIVING, I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED AT BIG O TIRES IN CRAIG, COLORADO.    JUNE 18, 2018  ' APPROX MILEAGE AT TIME OF INCIDENT: 2,500 MILES SINCE PURCHASE DATE    ON OUR RETURN TRIP FROM CO TO CA ON JUNE 20, 2018, WE STOPPED IN HEBER CITY, UTAH FOR FUEL. UPON CHECKING THE TIRES, I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WESTLAKE TIRES HAD LOST APPROX 40% OF A COMPLETE SECTION OF TREAD, ONLY THE STEEL CORDS WERE LEFT. THE TIRE HAD NOT LOST TIRE PRESSURE NOR HAD THE TEMP CLIMBED TO RAISE THE ALARM ON THE TPMS SYSTEM. LUCKY WE HAD CAUGHT THIS BEFORE THE TIRE BLEW APART AND CAUSED ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY.     WE PROCEEDED TO A LES SCHWAB TIRE CENTER LESS THAN  MILE AWAY WHERE I HAD ALL 4 TIRES REPLACED WITH SAILUN 14PLY TIRES.    THESE TIRES HAD LESS THAN 3000 MILES ON THEM. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF REPORTS OF THESE TIRES FAILING. THEY ARE SEVERELY OVER-RATED AND NEED TO BE PULLED OFF THE MARKET AND A NATION-WIDE RECALL ISSUED, HOPEFULLY BEFORE SOMEONE LOOSES THEIR LIFE.",
