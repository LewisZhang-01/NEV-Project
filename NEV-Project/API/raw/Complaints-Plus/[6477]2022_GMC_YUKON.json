        "summary": "The heads up display starting with the 2022 model removed the colored lane departure warning from the sides of the road graphic that is in line with the road and moved it to a very small display to the left side of the driver's field of view.  Now to see the lane departure warning requires a shift of the driver's view to the left and a head tilt if wearing progression bifocals.  On prior year models the colored warning provided an early alert well before the seat vibrates as the warning.  Taking my vision off the road caused me to come up on a very slow moving car that required the automatic braking to slow my vehicle",

        "summary": "Purchased the vehicle brand new on 12/3/21. On 12/21/21 vehicle started to display 'Service Safety Restraint System' and Airbag light was on. Also, all controls on the overhead console (sunroof, sunroof shade, MAP lights, rear access control, auto folding seat control) were no longer working. The passenger airbag light on the overhead console that notifies if the airbag is on or off was also no longer lighting up. The interior overhead lights in all 3 rows of the vehicle are not working and the fold down mirror lights are not working. I contacted my local dealership and they said the overhead console had failed and was the cause of the issues. They stated they had ordered the part and that I could come pickup my vehicle. They did state the part was backordered and it could be weeks before the part arrived.  I asked if the vehicle was safe to drive as the airbag light was on, the passenger airbag light was no longer lit up, and the 'Service Safety Restraint System' error continued to display. They stated they could not guarantee that the airbag system was functioning properly, but I could still come get the vehicle. I asked if they had a loaner vehicle they could provide me with as I was concerned about the airbag system not functioning properly and they stated they did not have any loaner vehicles. I have contacted the dealership several times to see if there are any updates on the part and they have told me the part is still backordered and have no ETA of when the part may be in. So, I have been driving around in a vehicle for almost two months that has non-functioning airbags. This is a significant safety hazard.",
