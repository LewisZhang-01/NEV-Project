When I ran into the curb it busted the tire and damaged my front bumper.  I could've been seriously injured, injured someone else, died, or killed someone because I had no control over the steering. This is very dangerous and I have seen a few other people report similar instances like mine.  the vehicle is currently at the Ancia Nissan in San Antonio and waiting for my insurance company to look at it.  The mechanic said it may be totaled but he wasn't sure.  There was no warning signs or anything.
