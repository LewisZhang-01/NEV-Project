The Minnesota Department of Transportation came up on the accident right away and got them safely off the highway so they wouldn\u2019t get hit by other cars.  They have provided us with the video of the accident.   My daughter and friend had no protection due to air bags not deploying.  She has been seen by a doctor for whip lash, neck and headache pains as symptoms.  As well as being traumatized by the incident me lack of protection.  We have sent the pictures and video to the insurance and they are reviewing to determine if the vehicle can be repaired of totaled.  Although, question as to whether they would fix it with what appears to be defective air bags.  We will not put her back on the vehicle if repaired without some air bag inspection.    Traffic control told her not to call police at accident site due to danger of being on the highway.  We did extensive research on the car before buying and we don\u2019t show any recalls as of today.  We are very lucky they weren\u2019t seriously injured and don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.",

        "summary": "So back in November of 2020 I had a few instances where my car had issues shifting into a different gear while I pressed the gas. It was like it stalled and was suspended for a moment making a really weird noise and then got punched into the next gear super fast and made a bad noise. I was driving between  20-35 miles when these occurrences happened. I went to the Hyundai dealership and had them look at my car but they found nothing. The mechanic test drove it but they found nothing was wrong. The attendant made notes on my account about all of this so that there would be a record. He told me to come in again if I had any more issues like this. Fast forward to now March 19th 2022, there were 4 occurrences in one day, where my car felt like it was stalling differently. While I was pressing the gas pedal driving between 20- 30 miles when suddenly it felt like there was a delay like liquid trying to pass through a tube but bubbles of air were blocking it from getting the liquid to flow. Which made my car shake and feel like I was driving over a bumpy road. I feel like if there had been cars in front of me for the first few instances, I could have rear-ended them. Luckily, that was not the case. Now, for the other occurrences on March 19th, 2022 if a car would have been going faster behind me, they could have rear-ended me, especially because of the stalling in acceleration.  I've made an appointment with the dealership for the end of this week but I am rrying to go in as soon as possible to get this looked at. I think its either a transmission, engine, or fuel system error just for the simple fact of pressing the gas and feeling it stall and have to force itself into a different gear.",

Shakiness of engine upon start up followed by completely shutting down and not starting. I have taken it to an auto shop and TWO different hyundai dealerships that have charged me for thousands of dollars on things like new spark plugs, fuel injector flush, O2 sensor, even tested all fuel injectors and came back with no issues. Hyundai says codes aren't showing any issues and sending me home with the same dangerous symptoms!! Even the guy at dealership said \"this is why I don't buy Hyundai.\" I can't find someone to help my case and I feel powerless. I have read so many similar online complaints for my same make and model and nobody is getting the help they need. It's WRONG for the consumer to have to pay for the mistakes made by a manufacturer. Please, somebody take this case on! My engine has all the issues described in the 2016 elantra engine recall, I don't understand how my VIN # does not show up under recall. I am at a dead end and Hyundai won't do anything but continue to charge me for services that are not fixing my car. Recent dealership even claimed he can't show me the diagnosis of codes because their \"computers don't work that way.\" I know there is a lack of honesty. My Hyundai case manager denied the recalls I asked about that are true and all over the internet. It's like they are paid to try and hide public information just to continue to profit off services that don't fix your vehicle.  Also, I have more documentation but max was 10 uploads here. I've been dealing with this since December 12, 2021. I also have video footage of what my car does upon start up from 3/05 and 3/06 where it smells like gasoline and entire vehicle shakes like it's going to explode. It all started during a cold front in Houston the day before my moving day to Oregon for new job and car has been CRAP since living in cold weather. ALWAYS a problem and not reliable.",

He found that there was hardly any oil in it, but there were no leaks or signs of leaks anywhere.

I've tried adding weight to the back of the car, less and more air in tires, new tires,  but nothing seems to fix the problem. It has knocked me sideways on the roads and when on the highway or interstate it's gets worse as you are driving faster. Winter time I have to drive the least amount I can on the faster roads because it can get out of control. I read on hyundai forums that this has been a problem for this type of car. Some people said getting better shocks reduces the problem, but does not completely fix it. I'm worried I will get into an accident because of this. I can't afford to try new shocks, because it doesn't completely fix the problem. It is also wearing the tires much faster then they should.

        "summary": "WHEN ENTERING A FAIRLY SEVERE CURVE,  LIKE A 270 DEGREE FREEWAY ON-RAMP OR OFF-RAMP TO AN OVERPASS, OR 90 DEGREE CURVES ON MOUNTAIN ROADS, AT NORMAL SPEEDS, THE ESC APPEARS TO SPORADICALLY TURN ON AND OFF AGGRESSIVELY.    THE BEHAVIOR IS SEVERE. THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, HARD, ABOUT TWICE PER SECOND. HARD ENOUGH TO FEEL LIKE YOU HIT A POTHOLE.  THE THROTTLE SEEMS TO BE CUT AS WELL. PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR DOES NOTHING WHILE IN THIS STATE, AS IF ITS BEEN DISCONNECTED.    AFTER STRAIGHTENING OUT OF THE CURVE, THE BEHAVIOR STOPS.    DISABLING VIA THE ESC BUTTON HAS NO EFFECT, THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.    A TRIP TO THE DEALER (10/2015) RESULTED IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF A BAD 'LATERAL SENSOR' - THAT IT WASN'T COMMUNICATING TO THE ESC.  HOWEVER THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY WAS   MORE INVOLVED:  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 17 DAYS AND HAD TWO OTHER 2016 ELANTRA GT MODELS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE SAME ISSUE.    ULTIMATELY THEY COULD NOT FIND A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM AND RETURNED THE CAR, STATING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT A \"SAFETY CONCERN\".  HOWEVER THEY INTENDED TO CONTINUE TROUBLESHOOTING THE ISSUE WITH ONE OF THE PROBLEM CARS BEING USED AS A \"TEST MULE\".  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE LIMITED TO THE 2016 ELANTRA GT.    I AM NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED OF THE \"SAFETY\" VERDICT.  WHILE I AGREE THAT ITS FAIRLY SAFE FOR \"ME\",  SINCE I'M AWARE OF THE BEHAVIOR AND ITS CONSISTENT, IT MIGHT BE A SURPRISE FOR ANOTHER ELANTRA GT OWNER WHOSE FIRST EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE IN THE RAIN OR SNOW.  WINTER IS COMING, AND WHILE I'M AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND THEREFORE WILL TAKE CURVES SLOWER AS TO NOT ANTAGONIZE THE CAR - WHAT ABOUT OTHERS?",

NOTHING HAPPENED, IT DIDN?T EVEN TRY TO CRANK. IT WAS AS IF THE BRAKE AND START BUTTON HAD NEVER BEEN DEPRESSED. THE CAR WOULD NOT START.  IT WAS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL.  THEN WE WOULD TRY STARTING THE CAR A SECOND TIME AND THE CAR WOULD START.  THESE EVENTS HAPPENED WITH A COLD START AND ALSO A WARM START.  WE TOOK THE 2016 CAR IN TO THE DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.      BETWEEN THE 2013 AND THE 2016 MODEL YEARS IT WOULD SEEM THAT SOMETHING COULD BE FIGURED OUT TO CORRECT AND FIX THE STARTING PROBLEM.
