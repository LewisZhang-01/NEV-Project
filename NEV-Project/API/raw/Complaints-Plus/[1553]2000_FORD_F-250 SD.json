THE ACCELERATOR ISSUE WILL SOMETIMES CORRECT ITSELF AFTER THE ENGINE HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER STARTUP, HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES THIS PRESENTS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. WHEN THE ENGINE IDLE CORRECTS ITSELF, THE RPMS WILL TAKE A +1000 RPM JUMP FROM THE CURRENT RPM POSITION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT ONLY A FEW FEET FROM THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU WITH LIGHT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE, THE JUMP FROM 1000 RPM TO 2000 RPM MAY SEND THE VEHICLE LURCHING FORWARD REAR-ENDING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF YOU IF YOU DO NOT SLAM ON THE BRAKES QUICKLY! ANOTHER SITUATION THAT HAS ALSO CAUSED A \"CLOSE CALL\" IS WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE 5 MPH AT 1000 RPM IN A PARKING LOT. THE REASON THIS SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE BRAKE IS TYPICALLY NOT BEING APPLIED AT ALL, SO WHEN THE +1000 RPM JUMP TO 2000 RPMS OCCURS IT CAN SEND YOUR VEHICLE LURCHING FORWARD INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE OR PEDESTRIAN THAT IS CROSSING IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.

APPROXIMATELY THREE WEEKS LATER SMOKE WAS DETECTED WHEN TRUCK WAS STARTED. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION (STILL IN MY DRIVEWAY, TRUCK STILL RUNNING), FLAMES WERE SEEN UNDER THE HOOD AT THE WIRING BESIDE THE MASTER CYLINDER. THE FIRE SOON STOPPED, AND THE WIRING WAS COOL.

THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE INITIAL FIRE INCIDENT, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SMOKE CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD OF THE TRUCK WHEN STARTED, CAUSING BRIEF BUT WELL VOICED DISCOMFORT FROM MY DAUGHTER. THE SMOKE CAME FROM THE SAME WIRING. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE INITIAL FIRE INCIDENT, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP (MONDAY MORNING). THE OWNER TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE SPEED CONTROL SWITCH AND I SHOULD TAKE IT TO FORD. FORD TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL FOR THIS SWITCH FOR MY TRUCK BECAUSE IT IS A DIESEL. THE RECALL 06V286000 MATCHES THE CONDITIONS AND DESCRIPTION IN THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH COULD OVERHEAT, RESULT IN SMOKE, OR BURN IN AN UNDERHOOD FIRE. AFTER RETURNING TO THE AUTO REPAIR SHOP, THE SWITCH WAS REPLACED AND A FUSED WIRING HARNESS WAS INSTALLED, PURCHASED FROM FORD. THE FORD DEALERSHIP I HAD CONTACTED, THE ONE WHERE THE PART WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PURCHASED FROM,  HAD 1,200 OF THEM IN STOCK, ACCORDING TO THE PHONE CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD. *TR",

WHILE SHOPPING FOR A REPLACEMENT SPRING, I WAS AMAZED HOW MANY STORES MADE COMMENTS LIKE \"WE SELL A LOT OF THESE\".

I AM A DEGREED MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND AM REASONABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE DESIGN OF SPRINGS.  I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT NO SPRING SHOULD EVER FAIL UNDER NORMAL USE. HAD THE SPRING FAILED WHILE I WAS ON THE ROAD, I WOULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. MY INFORMAL DATA COLLECTION TELLS ME THAT MOST OF THE FAILURES HAPPEN AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES. IT APPEARS THAT FORD HAS NO WAY TO KNOW ABOUT REPAIRS MADE BY NON-FORD SHOPS. GIVEN THAT THE PRICE DIFFERENCE FOR THE REPAIR IS SUBSTANTIAL, IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO SUGGEST THE MOST OF THE REPAIRS ARE MADE OUTSIDE OF FORD.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE SAFETY ASPECT  AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO CONTACT ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMPANY.  IN  MY BEST ENGINEERING JUDGMENT, THE SPRING FAILED DUE TO FATIGUE. THE PROBLEM IS MUCH LARGER THAN FORD REALIZES. AND ALL OF THE VEHICLES WITH THESE SPRINGS ARE GETTING OLDER EVERY DAY.

THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THEN THE ENGINE STALLED. LUCKILY I WAS IN A CONSTRUCTION AREA AT THE TIME AND THE SPEED LIMIT WAS ONLY 35 MPH. I PULLED OVER AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO A FORD DEALER 10 MILES BACK. TRI STAR OF SOMERSET, PA  ( WHICH IS A FORD DEALER) DETERMINED THE PROBLEM WAS THE CAM SHAFT SENSOR. IT COST $243.00 FOR REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF SENSOR (WHICH TOOK 8 DAYS DUE TO WORK LOAD BACKUP). IT COST ME $200.00 TO HAVE MY RV TOWED TO A LOCAL CAMPGROUND (WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE A RECEIPT FOR). IT COST ANOTHER $180.00 TO KEEP RV AT CAMPGROUND UNTIL REPAIRS TO TRUCK WERE COMPLETED. IN ADDITION TO THIS, IT COST $225.68 TO RENT A CAR FROM TRI STAR TO CONTINUE 200 MILES HOME TO WAIT UNTIL TRUCK WAS REPAIRED. TODAY I READ IN THE PAPER THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON 1997 THROUGH 2003 FORD SUPERDUTY TRUCKS. HOWEVER, MY F-250 IS NOT AMONG THE RECALLS (FORD/ E-SERIES, EXCURSION, F-450 SUPERDUTY, F-550 SUPERDUTY.

I PULLED ONTO A GRAVEL ROAD, LIFTED THE HOOD AND CLIMBED UP TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND. IMAGINE MY SUPRISE TO SEE A LEFT BANK SPARK PLUG, #8 CYLINDER, LYING AGAINST THE FUEL RAIL AND THE COIL FIRING AGAINST THE HEAD. I LIMPED HOME, WONDERING ALL THE WHILE HOW MUCH FUEL WAS POURING INTO THE OIL PAN!      I USED A STRONG FLASH LIGHT TO PEER INTO THE SPARK PLUG HOLE AND FOUND TO MY SUPRISE, VERY LITTLE IF ANY THREADS TO CONTIAN THE SPARK PLUG. I THEN USED A 90 DEG. PICK TO \"FEEL\" THE THREADS. NONE.     I CALLED JOE MACHENS FORD IN COLUMBIA, MO. TO SEE IF THIS MIGHT BE A COMMON PROBLEM. THEY INFORMED ME THEY SEE QUITE A FEW OF THE 5.4 LITER CYLINDER HEADS IN FOR REPAIR AND HAD HAD ONE 6.8. THEY INFORMED ME THAT FORD HAD ISSUED A TSB FOR THE LIGHTNING WITH THE 5.4 ( I CAN SEE WHY, A COMPRESSOR ON TOP OF THE ENGINE CAN CREATE PROBLEMS) OTHER THAN THE AFORMENTIONED TSB, NO OTHERS EXIST AND FORD HAS YET TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM. I CHECKED FOR INFO VIA THE GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE AND WASN'T ABLE TO FIND MUCH INFORMATION. I PROBABLY USED THE INCORRECT TERMINOLOGY. WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THE ALUMNIUM THREADS WERE INGESTED INTO THE CYLINDER, WHICH IN TURN WILL CAUSE SCARRING AND OIL CONTROL PROBLEMS. I DO KNOW HOWEVER, DUE TO WHAT I WAS TOLD BY THE PERSON AT JOE MACHENS FORD IN COLUMBIA, MO., IT SEEMS AS THOUGH FORD HAS NOT PRACTICED DUE DILIGENCE AS TO FINDING A SUITABLE COST EFECTIVE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT FOR THIS PROBLEM.*AK",

THIS TRUCK IS USED MAINLY ON PAVED ROADS; OCCASIONALLY ON GRAVEL ROADS. THE WORST \"OFF ROAD\" DUTY THIS TRUCK EVER SEES IS A RARE TRIP ONTO DIRT OR GRASS.  I AM CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING WHEELS BALANCED AND TIRES PROPERLY INFLATED AND ROTATED.   IN THE SPRING OF 2003, WITH ABOUT 20,000 MILES ON THE TIRES, I DISCOVERED A GRAPEFRUIT SIZED BULGE IN THE INSIDE SIDEWALL OF ONE OF THEM.  A FIELD REPRESENTATIVE FROM GENERAL TIRE PROCLAIMED THAT THIS BULGE WAS DUE TO A \"ROAD HAZZARD.\"  [MY FIRST SIDEWALL BULGE IN 37 YEARS OF DRIVING, BUT I GUESS IT CAN HAPPEN.  HOWEVER, DON'T LET THE LOW MILAGE ON THE TRUCK FOOL YOU.  ALTHOUGH I DRIVE LESS NOW THAN I USED TO, WITH OTHER VEHICLES I STILL AVERAGE OVER 35,000 MILES PER YEAR.  I HAVE OWNED A LOT OF TIRES.]  I WAS NOW SUSPICIOUS OF THESE TIRES, SO IN AUGUST 2003 (AT 22,000 MILES) BEFORE A 2,000 MILE TRIPT WHICH I HAD TO MAKE WITH THE TRUCK, I CAREFULLY INSPECTED THE TIRES AND DOUBLE CHECKED THE INFLATION.  UPON MY RETURN HOME I DISCOVERED A LEMON SIZED BULGE IN THE OUTSIDE SIDEWALL OF ANOTHER ONE OF THIS SET.  I THEN IMMEDIATLY REPLACED THE TIRES ON THE TRUCK WITH ANOTHER BRAND.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE REMOVED TIRES, I DISCOVERED THAT A THIRD TIRE HAD A WALNUT SIZED BULGE IN A SIDEWALL.  SO, IN 24,000 MILES, THREE OF THE ORIGINAL FOUR TIRES DEVELOPED SIDEWALL BULGES.  INTERESTINGLY, ALL OF THE BULGES WERE BETWEEN THE BEAD AND THE WIDEST PART OF THE SIDEWALL, NOT BETWEEN THE WIDEST PART OF THE SIDEWALL AND THE TREAD - WHERE YOU WOULD WOULD EXPECT A TIRE TO BE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER A \"ROAD HAZZARD.\"  IN MY OPINION, THE BIGGEST \"ROAD HAZZARD\" I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN THIS TRUCK ARE THESE TIRES.  I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ANY \"COMPENSATION\" FROM THIS COMPANY.  I JUST WANT TO WARN OTHER CONSUMERS AND NHTSA TO WATCH THESE TIRES.

I AM ONE OF THE FORTUNATE ONES THAT ARE HEAR TO TELL OF MY NEAR CATASTROPHES INVOLVING FIRESTONE TIRES. FARMER INSURANCE REPAIRED MY VEHICLE THE FIRST TIME AND SENT THE BLOWN TIRE ( WHAT WAS LEFT ) TO FIRESTONE AND A LETTER WAS SENT TO FARMERS INDICATING THAT LOW TIRE PRESSURE WAS THE CAUSE.  THE SECOND TIRE WAS SEPERATED IN MARCH OF 02 AND ONCE AGAIN DAMAGED MY VEHICLE.  ONCE AGAIN, I RECEIVED THE RESPONCE BACK. IT WAS THE SAME OLD STORY. IMPROPER AIR PRESSURE. MY VEHICLE IS DRIVEN AN AVERAGE OF 700 MILES PER WEEK. MY TIRES ARE MAINTAINED BY FLYIN J TRUCK CENTERS AND MY AIR PRESSURE IS DOCUMENTED FREQUENTLY AS REQUIRED. I AM UNDER THE BELIEF THAT INSUFFICIENT AIR PRESSURE IS THE STANDARD ANSWER GIVEN BY FIRESTONE TO NEGLECT COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES WHICH OCCUR BY THEIR FAULTY TIRES. THIS TREND IS VERY ALARMING AND I AM HOPING THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT CAN GET INVOLVED INTO A RESOLUTION. I AM VERY DISTURBED BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, FIRESTONE IS ABLE TO INSPECT THEIR OWN TIRES WITH NO INDEPENDANT AGENCY OVERSEEING THE PROCESS. ALSO HAVING A PARALEGAL ON STAFF TO SIGN THE DOCUMENTS SO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS THWARTED FROM RESPONDING. I WILL BE HAPPY TO FORWARD VIA FAX, ALL DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THIS MATTER. I HAVE CONTACTED ALL AGENCIES INCLUDING, FOX NEWS, NEVADA ATTORNEY GENERAL, PRIVATE COUNCIL, SENATORS HARRY REID AND JOHN ENSIGN, AND THE U.S. DEPT. OF TRANSPORTATION. I AM NOT GOING TO STOP MY CAMPAIGN UNTIL FIRESTONE STANDS UP AND TAKES THE RESPONCIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGES DUE TO FAULTY WORKMANSHIP OF THEIR TIRES. I BELIEVE FIRESTONE INTENDS TO SEE IF THIS ISSUE GETS SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET. PLEASE ADVISE ME OF YOUR RECEIPT OF THIS COMPLAINT AND A FAX NUMBER WHERE I CAN FORWARD ANY CORRESPONDENCE.
