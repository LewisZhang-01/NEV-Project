When me or my husband are driving the driver side seatbelt will release and we have to pull over to fasten it back again. It will do this several times while driving, which is a safety hazard. It has to be a defect in the connection of the seatbelt. The one on the passenger side works and have not had any problems with it coming undone. It is only the one on the driver's side that wants to come undone while driving. We will put it on and tug on it and it stays but when driving it will not stay fastened long. When they did the test at the Ford dealer in Florence, Alabama many years ago, all they did was fasten it without sitting in the seat and tug on it a few times and said it passed. We then moved to Texas in November of 2001 and on the way there it started releasing going down the road. Since the seatbelt was tested back then we were not sure if we could get it tested again for that purpose. Is there anything we can do to get this fixed even though we had it tested already once before?",

SYMPTOMS - THIS ISSUE MAINLY AFFECTS THE REAR LEFT AND RIGHT BRAKE LIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, AND HAZARD LIGHTS. THESE LIGHTS, PARTICULARLY BRAKE LIGHTS, CAN CEASE TO FUNCTION ENTIRELY, INTERMITTENTLY AND UNKNOWN TO THE DRIVER.    CAUSE - THERE IS A WIRE HARNESS WHICH CONNECTS TO THE \"MULTI - FUNCTION SWITCH\". THIS WIRE HARNESS IS PULLED WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TILTED DOWN. AS A RESULT, THE CONNECTOR OR INDIVIDUAL TERMINALS CAN BECOME LOOSE OR DISCONNECTED. THIS PROBLEM IS MOST PREVALENT WITH THE STEERING WHEEL IN THE DOWN POSITION, BUT ONCE LOOSE CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POSITION AND ANY DRIVING SITUATION.    SOLUTION - REPAIR OR REPLACE WITH MOTORCRAFT PART# WPT607, AND ENSURE THE HARNESS HAS ENOUGH SLACK TO ALLOW STEERING WHEEL TILT WITHOUT TENSION ON THE HARNESS.    IN OUR CASE, I REPLACED THE CONNECTOR AND PULLED THE WIRES ENOUGH TO ALLOW SLACK FOR STEERING WHEEL TILT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THIS ISSUE ONLINE, AND IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED BY F150 OWNERS.

THIS TYPE OF TREAD SEPARATION SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. I WANT GOODRICH TO REPLACE ALL TIRES, BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO USE THEM. HAD THIS FAILURE HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEED, RESULTS COULD BE WORSE.

I DID MANAGE TO DRIVE HOME WITH LITTLE TO NO BRAKES.  WHEN I GOT HOME I LOOKED IN THE BRAKE FLUID WELL AND THERE WAS NO FLUID IN THERE.  I LOOKED AT THE GROUND ON THE DRIVERS SIDE NEAR THE REAR TIRE AND I SAW FLUID DRIPPING ON THE GROUND.

NEEDLESS TO SAY, I NO LONGER HAVE THE USE OF MY VEHICLE.  I RECENTLY TOOK THE TRUCK IN FOR RECALL SERVICE TO HAVE THE GAS TANK SUPPORT STRAPS REPLACED, IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BRAKE LINE WAS COMPROMISED DURING THE RECALL WORK?

I CONTACTED FORD ABOUT THIS UNUSUAL INCIDENT AND THEY STATED THAT BECAUSE MY TRUCK IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY THAT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO A DEALER AND HAVE IT REPAIRED.

THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE ENDED VERY BADLY. THE BRAKE LINES SHOULD NOT RUPTURE.

I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME WITH THESE ENGINES BECAUSE OF THE ALUMINUM HEADS AND THERE WERE ONLY 3-4 THREADS ACTUALLY HOLDING THE SPARK PLUG.      A FORD MOTOR CO. WARRANTY INSPECTOR SAYS THE FORD TRITON V-8 ENGINES ARE \"DROPPING LIKE FLIES\" BECAUSE OF BLOWN SPARK PLUGS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FORD SPARK PLUG BLOWOUT ISSUE. FORD TRITON ENGINES FROM 1997 TO 2003 HAD A PROBLEM WHERE SPARK PLUGS WOULD RANDOMLY FLY OUT THE CYLINDER HEAD. THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO A FEW ISSUES (ENGINEERING DESIGN FLAW), FIRST THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT THREADS (3-4) IN THE HEAD TO PROPERLY HOLD THE SPARK PLUG. SECOND THE THREADS IN THE HEAD ARE NOT INSERTED, IN OTHER WORDS THE THREADS ARE IN THE ALUMINUM AND ARE NOT VERY STRONG.      SPARK PLUG EJECTION IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE FUEL VAPOR STARTS COMING OUT THE SPARK PLUG HOLE, WHICH IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THE FUEL VAPOR CAN BE IGNITED BY THE LOOSE SPARK PLUG - AND IN FACT THERE HAVE BEEN A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES REPORTED OF ENGINE FIRES DUE TO SPARK PLUG EJECTION/BLOWOUT.      FORD NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS OF SPARK PLUG BLOW OUT AND SHOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY REGARDLESS OF AGE ON THE SPARK PLUG BLOW OUT ISSUE, THEY ALSO SHOULD BE FORCED TO PAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF LABOR TIME, BECAUSE MOST OF THE REPAIRS COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. FORD HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS SERIOUS ISSUE OF AN ENGINEERING-DESIGN FLAW AND NEEDS TO RECALL 17 MILLION VEHICLES FROM 1997-2003.  *TR",

I SHUT THE TRUCK OFF. CALL A TOW TRUCK TO MY FORD DEALERSHIP. THERE THEY TELL ME THAT THE SPARK PLUG HAS SHOT OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD, STRIPPING THE ALUMINUM HEAD. I GET THE BILL FOR REPAIR IN WHICH THEY RE-BORE THE HEAD, AND INSTALL A HELI COIL AT A COST OF $560 PLUS LABOR.

IN AN EFFORT NOT TO DAMAGE THE VEHICLE FURTHER I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL, AND COAST TO THE BREAK DOWN LANE OF A THREE LANE HIGHWAY AND PROCEED TO CALL AAA TO GET A TOW. ONCE BACK AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP THE TECH TRIES TO DO THE SAME THING, AND RE-BORE THE HEAD TO INSTALL ANOTHER HELI COIL. HE DOES AND TAKES IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.

THE METAL GAS TANK STRAPS HAD COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH AND BROKE LEAVING THE TANK HANGING ON BY ONLY A COUPLE OF SCREWS.

THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF FOR ABOUT 90 MINS. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO RESTART  IT WOULD STALL.    TO GET STARTED I NEEDED TO KEEP FOOT ON GAS PEDAL (TO  MAINTAIN A HIGH ENOUGH RPM TO PREVENT THE STALL). IF I DID NOT KEEP THE RPMS UP, VEHICLE WOULD STALL.    WHILE DRIVING AND STOPPING,  I NEEDED TO KEEP MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL TO MAINTAIN THE RPMS.  (THIS CAN BE CHALLENGING WITH A 5-SPD.)

ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG ALL FORD V8'S AND V10'S FROM 1999 TO 2002. THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO LACK OF THREADS IN THE ALUMINUM HEADS (ONLY FOUR THEADS), AND HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL FIRES AND EXTENSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE. APPARENTLY ALL ATTEMPTS AT A RECALL AND CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT HAVE BEEN MET WITH RELATIVE DISREGARD. DESPITE THE FACT THAT FORD REDESIGNED THEIR HEADS AFTER 2002 TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM THEY STILL REFUSE ANY ASSISTANCE TO CUSTOMERS WHO SUFFER DUE TO THEIR DESIGN FLAW. APPARENTLY SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO DIE FROM THE ENGINE FIRE BEFORE ANYTHING WILL BE DONE. AND EVENTUALLY SOMEONE WILL DIE, IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.

AFTER SPENDING MONEY TO GET THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AT A GOODYEAR DEALERSHIP IN KINGMAN, ARIZONA, WE HAD TO ORDER A SPECIAL REPAIR KIT FROM BARIL ENGINE REBUILDING COMPANY IN GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN, PAYING FOR THE SHIPPING BOTH WAYS. A MECHANIC RESLEEVED THE CYLINDER.  AS I HAD TO MAKE A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT, WE HAD TO DRIVE FOR CLOSE TO 1,000 MILES WITH WRETCHED FUMES AND HORRID NOISE.   THE SECOND SPARK PLUG WAS SPIT OUT ON FRIDAY, FEBURARY 10, 2007. AS I HAD ANOTHER SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT, WHICH IS HOW I MAKE MY LIVING, WE HAD TO DRIVE TO PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, AND THENCE LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA, BEFORE ANOTHER REPAIR KIT WAS RENTED TO BE USED BY YET ANOTHER MECHANIC.  THE THIRD SPARK PLUG WAS SPIT OUT TWO WEEKS LATER, ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2007, AS WE WERE DRIVING FROM PENSACOLA TO LAFAYETTE. WE RENTED THE TOOL KIT FROM BARIL ENGINE REBUILDING COMPANY ONCE AGAIN.  THIS ORIGINAL FORD V-10 TRITON ENGINE DIED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 2007, ON INTERSTATE 80/94 JUST EAST OF MILE MARKER 160. TWO CYLINDERS HAD LOST COMPRESSION ENTIRELY. NO ONE AT TERRY FORD LINCOLN MERCURY IN PEOTONE, ILLINOIS, COULD EXPLAIN WHY THIS HAD HAPPENED.

WE HAVE THOSE REPORTS SO WE CONTACTED OUR INSURANCE THEY TOLD US THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD FULL COVERAGE THE INSURANCE DID NOT COVER THE DAMAGE THAT WAS CAUSED. SO THEY RECOMMENDED US TO TALK TO FORD TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR US. BUT WHEN WE CONTACTED THEM THEY TOOK OUR INFORMATION. THEY REQUESTED PICTURES AND THE REPORTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE WE FAXED THEM TO CARMEN FROM THE FORD CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT. BUT WE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING BACK FROM THEM THAT IS WHEN WE SENT THEM A LETTER NOTIFYING THEM HOW DISAPPOINTED WE WHERE. THE NEXT DAY CARMEN CONTACTED MY DAUGHTER ELISA RODRIGUEZ AND TOLD HER THAT THEY STILL HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR US BUT THAT SHE WOULD LET US KNOW. AS THE DAYS PASSED WE  WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM FORD SO WE WOULD CALL THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT NOW THEY NOT ONLY DIDN'T GIVE US INFORMATION BUT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN OUR CALLS WE LEFT VARIOUS MESSAGES. BUT THERE  WAS NO ANSWER . UNTIL ONE DAY MY DAUGHTER CALLED AND CARMEN FINALLY ANSWERED AND TOLD US THAT THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR US BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TO BADLY BURNED IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED IT TO GET ON FIRE.

THE TREAD WEAR ON ALL 4 TIRES WAS SIMILAR AND VERY LOW, IMPLYING TO ME THAT THE TIRES WERE RELATIVELY NEW.  APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASE, MY RIGHT FRONT TIRE SUFFERED A TOTAL TREAD SEPARATION.  AT ABOUT 75 MPH ON A HOT DRY DAY, I HEARD A LOUD ROAR AND AN 'EXPLOSION' FROM THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY THINKING I HAD A BLOWOUT, BUT DISCOVERED THE TIRE WAS STILL FULLY INFLATED BUT HAD COMPLETELY LOST ALL TREAD.  I MOVED THE VEHICLE TO A SAFE LOCATION AND INSTALLED THE SPARE.  I EXAMINED THE TIRE, AND COULD SEE THAT THE STEEL BELTS WERE STILL INTACT AND APPEARED CLEAN AND NEW.  THE LAYERS OF RUBBER THAT SEAL THE BELTS IN WERE VISIBLE, AND IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE TREAD LAYER HAD SIMPLY NOT ADHERED TO THE CORE.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER THREE TIRES.  I TOOK THE TIRE TO DISCOUNT TIRE CO., WHICH CARRIES CONTINENTAL TIRES, AND THEY SAID CONTINENTAL WOULD ONLY COVER HALF THE REPLACEMENT COST.      CONSIDERING THE DANGER OF A TOTAL TREAD SEPARATION LIKE THIS, AND THAT IT IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, I'M CONCERNED THAT THE COMPANY (CONTINENTAL) ISN'T SO MUCH AS INCONVENIENCED BY THE FACT THAT THEIR PRODUCT IS CAUSING THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I WAS LUCKY, BUT HAD I INSTEAD BEEN ON A CURVE WHEN THE TREAD SEPARATED, I CAN SEE HOW THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LESS FAVORABLE.  THE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE WAS MINIMAL, BUT AGAIN, THIS IS MORE LUCK THAN ANYTHING ELSE.     JUST GLANCING THROUGH THE LIST OF COMPLAINTS CONCERNING CATASTROPHIC TREAD LOSS ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF TIRE, IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO BE STRUCK BY THE STAGGERING NUMBER OF THEM.

UPON INSPECTION MY HUSBAND NOTICED THAT THE NUMBER 3 SPARK PLUG AND COIL PACK HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE CYLINDER HEAD.  HE ALSO NOTICED THAT IT HAD CAUSED A SIZEABLE DENT IN THE FUEL INJECTOR RAIL.  THE RAIL/FUEL LINE WHICH PROVIDES FUEL UNDER PRESSURE TO THE INJECTORS IS MADE OF STEEL. THE COIL PACK ALTHOUGH THE MOUNTING POINT WAS BROKEN OFF REMAINED PLUGGED IN AND FUNCTIONING.  THE SPARK PLUG ALSO REMAINED IN TACT AND APPEARED UNDAMAGED.  THE SPARK PLUG STILL RESTING IN THE SPARK PLUG BOOT MANAGED TO FIND A GROUND VERY NEAR IF NOT ON THE DENTED FUEL RAIL.  THIS WAS EVIDENT BY THE FACT THAT IT CONTINUED SPARKING AS THE MOTOR SAT AND IDLED AS WE TRIED TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.  IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SORT OF FUEL LEAK OR HAD IT RAN LONGER SPARKING AGAINST THE FUEL RAIL, I SUSPECT A FIRE COULD HAVE RESULTED.

HOWEVER IN CHECKING ON THE INTERNET THE SPARK PLUG EJECTION SEEM TO BE COMMON AND THE DENTED FUEL RAIL NOT UNCOMMON.  THE COIL PACK CONTINUING TO FIRE SEEMS LIKELY AS THE CONNECTION TO THE WIRING HARNESS SEEMS QUITE SECURE. IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THE STEEL FUEL RAIL IS A VERY CONVENIENT GROUND.  NOT ONLY DID THIS HAPPEN ONCE NO IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON JANUARY 19, 2007.  FORD REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM WITH THE CYLINDER HEAD AND CHARGES $3000 TO REPLACE THE HEAD AND ALL OF IT INTERNAL COMPONENTS EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS.  FORD BLAMES THIS PROBLEM ON THE SPARK PLUG I CAN ASSURE YOU THE SPARK PLUG WAS COMPLETELY IN TACT AND SPARKING NOT IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER MIND YOU BUT AGAINST A STEEL FUEL LINE. FORD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS AT 100,000 MILES MY TRUCK WAS ONLY AT 80,000.  *NM",

I WENT AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND SAW MY TRUCK ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  I RAN INTO THE HOUSE, CALLED MY WIFE TO GET UP, GET OUR DAUGHTER, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CALL 911.  911 TOLD US TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.  WE EVACUATED OUR HOME W/ OUR DOGS IN TOW AND WE ALL PROCEEDED TO WATCH IN HORROR (WITH THE ENTIRE SUBDIVISION) AS THE TRUCK WENT UP IN FLAMES AND SMOKE, NOT KNOWING IF THE HOUSE WOULD BE NEXT.

I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL THE REST OF THE LIGHTNING OWNERS ON THEIR TIRE LOCATIONS. I ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH THOSE TIRES PULLING MY TRUCK FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THE RUTS IN THE ROAD. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS NORMAL FOR SUCH WIDE TIRES. I RUN NITTO TIRES ON IT NOW WITH NO ISSUES (SPLITTING OR PULLING) WHAT SO EVER. I NO LONGER USE ANY TYPE OF GOODYEAR TIRES ON ANY OF MY CARS AND TRUCK. KRAMER GOODYEAR TOLD ME THE LAST TIME THAT GOODYEAR IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THEY'LL PRORATE ME A PRICE ON A NEW F150. AFTER THE 7TH TIME I ASKED WHY WOULD I WANT TO KEEP BUYING ANOTHER OVERPRICED F150 OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT I KNOW WILL SPLIT SOONER OR LATER AND I'D BE RIGHT BACK IN HERE GETTING A PRORATED TIRE AGAIN? THE 295/45/18 GOODYEAR F1 IS A DEFECTIVE TIRE AND SOMEONE IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY ARE GOING TO BE KILLED RUNNING THESE TIRES. LIGHTNING ARE HIGH PERFORMANCE TRUCKS AND MOST PEOPLE THAT OWN THEM, RACE THEM. FORD SHOULD REALLY CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOODYEAR(NASCAR SHOULD TOO).

I TOLD THEM SEAT-BELTS SHOULD NEVER FAIL.  HE TOLD ME SEAT-BELTS DO FAIL AND HE HAS SEEN THEM FALL APART BEFORE (THE CONVERSATION MAY HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR QUALITY PURPOSES).   FORD IS TAKING THE POSITION THAT IF ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS DIES DUE TO A SEAT BELT FAILURE THAT IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM SINCE THEIR SEAT BELTS ARE ONLY WARRANTED FOR 5 YEARS/50,0000 MILES.  THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. TO DATE 40% OF THE SEAT BELT LATCHES IN MY VEHICLE HAVE  FAILED (I HAVE 5 LATCHES IN MY VEHICLE 2 HAVE FAILED).

I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE AIR INTAKE CONTROL VALVE. ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER AT THE EXACT SAME SPOT AND TIME THE ENGINE AGAIN STALLED ON ME.

MY FORD DEALER IS TELLING ME THEY CAN NOT FIND THE PROBLEM WITH IT AND STATED I COULD PICK THE TRUCK UP AND DRIVE IT IF I WANTED TO. NOT WANTING TO HAVE MYSELF OR MY FAMILY KILLED IN A CAR CRASH I TOLD THEM NO AND THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIX THE TRUCK. THEY AGREED TO TRY AND FIX THE TRUCK. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH THIS NEXT ISSUE BUT IF YOU CAN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. WHILE THEY TRY TO FIND THE PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP MY TRUCK FOR 30 DAYS AND I WOULD HAVE TO RENT A CAR. AT $20 PER DAY FOR 30 DAYS THAT WOULD COST ME $600.

WHEN THE SPARE WAS BROUGHT OUT FROM THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE TRUCK, SEVERAL GROOVES ABOUT THE SIZE OF A MAN\u0019S FINGER AND ABOUT 3/8 OF AN INCH DEEP HAD BEEN RUBBED INTO THE SIDEWALL OF THE SPARE. THE TIRE AGENCY DID NOT RECOMMEND USING THE SPARE SO I KEPT THE OLD TIRE IN PLACE.    I WENT TO THE FORD AGENCY WHERE I HAD BOUGHT THE TRUCK, SEGUIN MOTORS AND TOLD THEM MY STORY. SEGUIN MOTORS TOLD ME THAT THIS DAMAGE WAS COSMETIC AND THAT THE TIRE WAS SAFE TO USE AND THAT FORD WAS NOT LIABLE FOR THIS \u001cCOSMETIC\u001d WEAR.    ONE OF THE SEGUIN MOTORS REPAIR PEOPLE TOLD ME HE HAD SEEM THESE GROVES ON THE SPARES OF F150S THAT WERE LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS OLD.

THE VEHICLE STILL MADE THE NOISE AND I GOT THE MECHANIC TO LISTEN. I ASKED HIM IF THEY CHECKED THE SPARK PLUGS BECAUSE THEY ARE KNOWN TO LOOSEN ON THIS TYPE ENGINE DUE TO POOR ENGINEERING. THE MECHANIC DISMISSED MY CONCERN AND INFORMED ME OF THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE NOISE WAS AND THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DRIVE IT A WHILE AND SEE IF THE NOISE LESSENS. 1 WEEK LATER THIS SAME VEHICLE BLEW A SPARK PLUG OUT THUS STRANDING ME ON THE HIGHWAY.     I BELIEVE IT TO BE UNJUST THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY CAN SELL A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT TO THEIR CUSTOMER AND NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN THE ENGINE AND IT WOULD BE PROPER FOR FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT WITH ONE THAT WILL NOT FAIL AGAIN. SUPPOSEDLY THERE IS AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THIS ENGINE HEAD, BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT MY HEAD WILL BE REPLACED WITH THIS NEWER TYPE.

UPON FAILURE, THE VEHICLE OBVIOUSLY STARTED MISFIRING, BUCKING, AND WAS A HANDFUL WHEN PULLING OVER TO SIDE OF THE ROAD.    FORD ONLY USED 4 SETS OF THREADS ON THEIR LIGHTINING HEADS FROM 1999 TO EARLY 2003.  CONVENTIONAL HEADS TYPICALLY USE BETWEEN 8 AND 10 THREADS TO HOLD A PLUG, BUT FORD DESIGNED THEIR HEADS WITH ONLY 4 THREADS ON MANY MODULAR 5.4-LITER V8 MOTORS TOO (NOT JUST THE LIGHTNING).  THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, AS THEY HAVE CHANGED THE HEAD DESIGN IN EARLY 2003 TO A NEW PART WITH 8 THREADS.  BUT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR OLDER LIGHTNINGS (AND OTHER F-150'S), EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL SAFETY PROBLEM (FIRE, LOSS OF CONTROL, ETC.).  I HAVE ALREADY HAD MY HEAD REPLACED WITH ANOTHER INFERIOR 4-THREAD DESIGN, AND I WONDER WHEN THE NEXT PLUG WILL BE BLOWN FROM MY ENGINE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NHTSA ENCOURAGE FORD TO RETROFIT ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES AS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR MANY LIGHTNING OWNERS.",

I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER AND ALSO AN AUTHORIZED BF GOODRICH DEALER AND THEY CHECKED THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT WHICH THEY BOTH FOUND TO BE WITH IN SPECIFICATIONS. BOTH THE DEALER AND THE BF GOODRICH DEALER CAME UP WITH ALMOST THE SAME CONCLUSION. WHICH IS WHY I AM SUBMITTING THIS LETTER TO YOU. MY RESEARCH ON THIS MATTER WITH FORD FOUND THE FOLLOWING 1)  FORD INSTALLED SMALLER TIRES ON MY VEHICLE THEN WHAT WAS INDICATED ON THE VEHICLE DESCRIPTION STICKER THAT ALL NEW VEHICLES COME WITH ON THE WINDOW. THE STICKER INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAVE P275/70 R 17 INSTALLED BUT THE VEHICLE WAS DELIVERED TO ME WITH P275/60 TIRES. SEEING IF THIS WAS A ISOLATED CASE I FOUND A DIFFERENT FORD DEALER WHICH ALSO INSTALLED SMALLER TIRES THAN WHAT WAS SPECIFIED ON THE NEW VEHICLE DESCRIPTION STICKER. I TOOK PICTURES OF THIS PRACTICE WHICH I HAVE. WHEN I CONFRONTED THE SERVICE MANAGER OF WHY THESE TIRES ARE ON THESE VEHICLES HIS ANSWER WAS THAT FORD USES WHAT THEY HAVE ON HAND AT THE TIME. THE  2ND IMPORTANT FINDING IS THAT THE AIR PRESSURE THAT IS INDICATED IN THE DOOR PILLAR INDICATES TO USE 26 LBS OF AIR IN THE FRONT TIRES ON MY 2001 F 150, ACCORDING TO FORDS OWN INFORMATION AND THREE AUTHORIZED BF GOODRICH DEALERS THAT AIR PRESSURE IS NOT CORRECT AND SHOULD BE WITHIN 30 TO 35 LBS. I INVESTIGATED THE 2002 F 150 WITH THE SAME TIRE SIZE AS MY VEHICLE AND THEY HAVE THE CORRECT AIR PRESSURE NOW STATED ON THE DOOR PILLAR STICKER @ 30 TO 32 LBS. THE DIFFICULTY THAT I AM HAVING AND PROBABLY MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE IS THAT BF GOODRICH WILL NOT WARRANTY THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT I WAS USING THE INNCORRECT AIR PRESSURE IN THE TIRES , WHEN IN FACT I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING FORDS SPECIFICATIONS THAT WAS ON THE DOOR PILLAR FOR THIS 2001 FORD VEHICLE AND WHICH HAVE NOW CHANGED IN THE 2002 MODELS WITHOUT LETTING THE 2001 OWNERS AWARE OF THIS CHANGE .

I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO PARK, GOING LESS THAN 5 MPH, WHEN MY FOOT SLIPPED AND I BUMPED MY FATHER IN LAW'S REAR BUMBER.  THE COLLISION WAS NOT HARD.  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO HIS TRUCK.  MY TRUCK'S LICENSE PLATE WAS SLIGHTLY DENTED AND THE BUMBER COVER WAS ONLY SCRATCHED.  THIS MILD IMPACT, HOWEVER DID CAUSE BOTH MY AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY.  I WAS NOT HURT. I REPORTED INCIDENT TO MY INSURANCE AND THEY REFERRED ME TO A BODY SHOP FOR REPAIRS.  WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP MY TRUCK TODAY, I WAS TOLD BY BODY SHOP EMPLOYEE THAT IT WAS A STRANGE INCIDENT BECAUSE THE IMPACT HAD BEEN SO MILD AND THE AIR BAGS WERE NOT FULLY DEPLOYED.  AS I RESEARCHED THIS WEBSITE I DID FIND INFORMATION ON NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 01VO82000, WHICH ADDRESSES THE AIRBAGS NOT FULLY DEPLOYING.  I AM NOT ONLY ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM, BUT ALSO AT HOW EASILY THE AIRBAGS DID DEPLOY AT SUCH A LOW SPEED, LOW IMPACT INCIDENT.  *AK",

ALTHOUGH MY TRUCK WAS SOLD AS A 2001 MODEL, FORD HAS SUBSEQUENTLY MADE TWO CRITICAL SAFETY MODIFICATIONS IN THE 2001 SUPERCREWS THAT WERE PRODUCED AFTER MY BUILD DATE. THE \"LATEST\" 2001 MODEL INCLUDES REAR SEAT HEADRESTS AND CHILD SEAT ANCHORS IN THE REAR SEATS. AS NOTED IN MY REPORT, I WAS RECENTLY DRIVING IN THE CITY AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH WHEN I WAS FORCED TO MAKE A PANIC STOP. MY WIFE, WHO WAS RIDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REAR SEAT (TWO-POINT SEAT BELT), WAS INITIALLY PUSHED FORWARD BY THE FORCE OF THE BRAKING THEN HIT HER HEAD ON THE REAR WINDOW UPON RECOIL. FORTUNATELY, SHE SUFFERED NO INJURIES. AT THE SAME TIME, MY 3 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER (SITTING IN A PROPERLY INSTALLED, DOUBLE SHOULDER HARNESS CHILD SEAT) WAS ALSO PUSHED FORWARD AND BACK BY THE FORCE OF THE STOP. DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS WELL SECURED IN THE SEAT, THE FORWARD AND BACK MOTION WAS INTENSIFIED BY THE LACK OF A CHILD SEAT ANCHOR. IN MY OPINION, FORD'S RECOGNITION OF THESE SAFETY \"DEFECTS\" IS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE MADE TO TRUCKS PRODUCED AFTER NOVEMBER 2000. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS INJURY AS A RESULT OF THESE SAFETY DEFECTS, ALL 2001 SUPERCREWS PRODUCED PRIOR TO THE MODIFICATION DATE SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR RETROFITTING. *AK",

MY TRUCK WAS EQUIPPED WITH A 4X4, 5.4 LITER, AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, TOWING PACKAGE, AND IT WAS AN XLT LARIAT.  ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES!  MY REPORTED CONCERN IS THAT THE SUSPENSION IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE RATED TOWING CAPACITY. I WAS TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE AT ABOUT 60 MPH. A CAR CUT IN FRONT OF ME AND I MOVED TO THE LEFT LANE TO AVOID RUNNING INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. MY TRAILER'S EMPTY WEIGHT WAS 5000 LBS AND I ESTIMATE THAT I HAD ANOTHER 1000-1500 LBS INSIDE. THE  TRUCK WAS EQUIPPED WITH WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION BARS AND AN  ANTI-SWAY BAR(REESE MFG.). WHEN I CHANGED LANES THE TRUCK SWAYED/LEANED HARD TO THE LEFT, THEN SWAYED HARD TO THE RIGHT. THE TRUCK THEN ROLLED OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND LANDED ON THE DRIVER'S  SIDE DOOR SLIDING DOWN THE EDGE OF THE INTERSTATE. THE TRUCK AND OUR 29 FOOT CAMPER WERE TOTALED. THERE WERE FOUR PASSENGERS IN THE TRUCK: MYSELF, WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN. EVERYONE SURVIVED WITH MINOR CUTS A",
