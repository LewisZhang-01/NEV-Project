I am wondering why we still use explosive materials and a device that causes so many injuries.  There has to be another device to absorb the force of impact than an explosive device that injures, maim, and can kill people.  I want to send images of my injuries which are extensive.  Is this what happens each time the airbags ignite? I was close due to my small stature.  The bag hit me in the chest and face.  Volvo is a safe car.  I was traveling at 55mph,  a woman stopped her car in the passing lane feet in front of me, everyone was doing 55 mph and more.  There was nowhere to go to escape the impact.  Frederick, MD Hwy 15 South at 7th Street has many oncoming ramps, there needs to be warning about oncoming and stopped vehicles.  The speed limit is 65mph before these fast-moving on-ramps.  A flashing light would also help.",

AS STATED, IF THE SYMPTOMS REOCCUR, PLEASE EITHER CONTACT ME DIRECTLY, OR CONTACT THE SERVICE MANAGER AT VOLVO OF MEMPHIS, RANDY PEARSON, SO THAT WE MAY GET BEEN INVOLVED ONCE AGAIN TO REVIEW YOUR CONCERNS REGARDING YOUR VEHICLE.  TO DATE, YOUR VEHICLE IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED.  THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT YOUR VEHICLE.   ERICA KIRSCH  PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COORDINATOR  VOLVO CARS OR NORTH AMERICA\"    I AM NOT INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO PURSUE THIS JUST BECAUSE OF REPAIR COSTS I FEEL SHOULD BE COVERED BY VOLVO.  THE SYMPTOMS I HAVE REPEATEDLY EXPERIENCED ARE SCARY AND A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  I ALSO SAW AN ON COMPLAINT #10288666 FILED ON FEB 18 2010 THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME ISSUE AS MINE.

ON THE SECOND SERVICE I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY REAR BRAKES COMPLETELY WORN OUT AND THEY HAVE TO CHANGE NOT ONLY BRAKE PADS BUT ALSO ROTORS AND SOMETHING ELSE, I ENDED UP PAYING $1000+ FOR THAT \"SERVICE\". INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOLD AT DEALERSHIP THAT IT IS VERY COMMON PROBLEM FOR MY CAR KIND TO HAVE REAR BRAKE PADS WEAR OUT QUICKLY AND THEY HAVE TO BE CHANGED EVERY 5000-7000 MILES (NO INFORMATION ON THAT IN THE OWNERS MANUAL, EITHER NOBODY WARNED ME ABOUT THAT ON THE FIRST SERVICE, BETTER YET THEY DID NOT EVEN CHECKED REAR BRAKE PADS NOR TELL ME HOW MUCH OF IT LEFT). NOW WHEN MY WARRANTY IS OVER I NOTICED VERY LOUD METALLIC BANGING NOISE THAT COMES FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I TOOK THE CAR TO INDEPENDENT VOLVO MECHANIC SINCE I DO NOT TRUST DEALER ANY MORE. MECHANIC FIXED ACTUALLY 2 DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WERE MAKING SOME NOISE. I PAID $330 AND TOOK MY CAR HOME, JUST TO FIND THAT LOUD NOISE IS STILL THERE WHEN I WAS GOING OVER BUMPS IN THE ROAD. I TOOK MY CAR BACK AND MECHANIC ORDERED YET ANOTHER PART WHICH ONLY CAME 2 WEEKS LATER. NOW MY CAR IS AT THE MECHANIC'S WHO CALLED AND TOLD ME THAT THERE MORE PARTS TO BE CHANGED AND THAT HIS FRIEND AT DEALERSHIP TOLD HIM THAT IT IS VERY COMMON WARRANTY REPAIR ON MY CAR KIND. WELL THEY GOT LUCKY IN MY CASE, I AM OVER ON MY WARRANTY BY 2000 MILES. BUT WILL I BUY VOLVO EVER AGAIN? - NO WAY!!! WILL I SUGGEST TO ANYONE TO BUY A VOLVO? - ONLY TO SOMEONE I DISLIKE!.  *LA",

MY CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE WITHOUT REAR BRAKES, THOUGH THE DEALER LET ME DRIVE AWAY ANYWAY.  MY PROBLEM IS THIS, THE VOLVO DEALER, TWO DIFERENT SERVICE MANAGERS, AND VOLVO NORTH AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE HAVE INFORMED ME THAT THIS SITUATION IS \"NORMAL\" AND THEY EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH MANY CUSTOMERS ON A WEEKLY BASIS.  IF THIS IT INDEED TRUE, THEN WHY WOULD VOLVO NOT MAKE A NOTATION IN THE OWNERS MANUAL, UNDER THE MAINTENANCE SECTION, TO CHECK BRAKE PADS ON A FREQUENT BASIS.  I HAVE FOLLOWED THE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS TO THE 'T', WHICH CLEARLY STATES THAT BRAKE PADS SHOULD BE INSPECTED AT 7,500 AND 15,000 MILES.  IF AS VOLVO SUGGESTS, THE PADS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO LAST 15,000 MILES, WHY IN THE WORLD DO THEY NOT NOTIFY OWNERS OF THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION?  THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST ABSURB THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF.  BEING A MECHANIC MYSELF, I FIND THIS SITUATION TO BE UNBELIEVABLE.  I HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY A MANUFACTURER CAN STAND THERE AND TELL ME THAT I SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO GET MORE THAT 12-15,000 ON A SET OF BRAKE PADS.  ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I SPOKE TO AT VOLVO NA, VOLVO IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND WORKING ON FINDING A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT PAD THAT WILL PAST LONGER.  IN THE MEANTIME, MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION, AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF OTHER CONSUMERS, DUE TO VOLVO'S INEPTITUDE, AND GENERAL LACK OF CONCERN FOR CONSUMER SAFETY.  I AM DRIVING A CAR THAT I BOUGHT, BECAUSE OF IT'S SAFETY REPUTATION, THEN COME TO FIND OUT IT COULD BE A DEATH TRAP IF THE REAR BRAKES FAIL.  I AM ALSO CAUGHT IN A CATCH 22 WITH VOLVO. *AK",
