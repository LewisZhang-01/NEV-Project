        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK TODAY DURING A RAIN STORM IN RUSH HOUR (I'M TRAVELING AT 10MPH TOP), MY ENGINE SUDDENLY LOST POWER AND SOUNDED AS IF IT HAD LOST THE MUFFLER, EXCEPT THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  BECAUSE OF THE RAIN, IT WASN'T AS LOUD AS THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO, BUT I KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THANKS TO MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE.  I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY AND EXITED THE HIGHWAY.  ONCE THE RAIN STOPPED, I WAS SURE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS OCCURRING AT ALL, BUT TO HAVE IT HAPPEN TWICE!  THERE IS SERIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DESIGN IN FORD'S ENGINES (MINE IS A 5.4 V8, F-250.)  I SEE ALL THE REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND IT MENTIONS THE FACT THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRES.  WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME THE FIRST TIME, I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT IN FOR SERVICE, SO I DID.  AND I DID SO AGAIN TODAY, TAKING THE BACKROADS.  ONLY LATER THIS EVENING, WHILE RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, DID I DISCOVER THE DANGER.  PLEASE APPLY PRESSURE TO FORD TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  AND SINCE THIS IS A COSTLY REPAIR THAT I FEEL IS CAUSED BY POOR DESIGN, IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE BURDEN OF FORD CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THEIR VEHICLES IN THE FIRST PLACE. *TR",

I HAD JUST CHECKED ALL THE TIRES FOR CORRECT AIR PRESSURE BEFORE LEAVING HOME SINCE I WAS TAKING A LOAD OF PIGS TO MARKET. WITHOUT WARNING, SUDDENLY I WAS IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE JERK LEFT INTO THE ONCOMING LANE.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL JUST IN TIME TO AVOID A HEAD-ON COLLISION AS MY TRUCK WENT INTO THE DITCH AND STOPPED.  THE COMPLETE OUTER LAYER OF RUBBER CAME OFF MY LEFT FRONT TIRE AND WRAPPED ITSELF AROUND THE INSIDE DISC BRAKE/AXLE ASSEMBLY AND TORE OFF ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES FROM THEIR MOORING LEADING TO THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE. (I ONLY HAVE 23,400 MILES ON THIS TRUCK AND HAVE HAD NO OTHER TIRE INCIDENTS). I HAD TO REMOVE THE TIRE WHICH STAYED INFLATED MINUS ITS COMPLETE OUTER SHELL IN ORDER TO ENTANGLE AND REMOVE THE OUTER SHELL PORTION OF THE TIRE FROM THE BRAKE/AXLE ASSEMBLY. THE MAIN STEEL BRAKE LINE WAS NOT BROKEN AS WERE OTHER RUBBER LINES TO THE BRAKE ASSY.  I AM AWAITING AN EVALUATION FROM FORD ON THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL ALIGNMENT AND BRAKE ASSEMBLY/LINES CONDITION. FORD HAD NO RECALL ON THE TIRES AND AT FIRST FIRESTONE SERVICE MANAGER PROMISED TO REPLACE ALL OF MY TIRES FREE OF CHARGE BECAUSE THERE WAS A RECALL ON THAT FIRESTONE TIRE.  THE NEXT DAY, ONCE THEY REPLACED THE TIRES THEY CAME IN AND ADVISED ME THAT THE RECALL DID NOT MATCH THE SERIAL NUMBER ON MY TIRES AND TOLD ME THEN THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT. TO COMPENSATE ME FOR THEIR MISTAKE ON THE RECALL THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT CHARGE ME FOR THE LABOR PORTION OF THE REPLACEMENT IF I WOULD PAY FOR THE TIRES. I WAS NOT ABOUT TO DRIVE ON THE REMOVED TIRES AGAIN AND WAS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, SO I PAID THE BILL. WHILE CASH LAYOUT IS AN ISSUE HERE THE REAL ISSUE IS POOR TIRE PERFORMANCE THAT CAME WITHIN A HEARTBEAT OF KILLING ME AND MANY OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE.  *TR",

I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO LET MY FOOT OFF OF THE THROTTLE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RPMS.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, THE VEHICLE SHIFTED HARD INTO 2ND GEAR AND PROCEEDED FORWARD.

I TOOK THE TRUCK TO COTTMAN TRANSMISSION IN PLACERVILLE CALIF ON 8-30-06, AS ACCORDING TO FUTURE FORD, WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK, THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  AFTER TEST DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH A REP FROM COTTMAN TRANSMISSION, HE DETERMINED 2ND GEAR WAS LOST AND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PROBLEMS.  HE ALSO STATED THAT REBUILDING 2001 FORD F250 TRANSMISSIONS WAS A COMMON PROCEDURE FOR THEM.  HE EXPLAINED ONE OF THE DESIGN PROBLEMS AND FAILURE POINTS ON THE TRANSMISSION.

MY TRUCK WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 30 MPH BUT THE ENGINE STALLED, ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING, JUST AS A LIGHT TURNED RED.  I WAS UNABLE TO STOP IN TIME AND NARROWLY AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT AS THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC JUST MISSED ME.   AFTER THE INCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE TRUCK AND LIMP IT HOME.

THE EXHAUST COMING FROM THE END OF THE TAILPIPE DID NOT HAVE THIS SMELL. AFTER 6 MONTHS, I BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN MY PLACE OF PURCHASE, BILL MARSH FORD IN NEWTOWN, PA.  THE SHOP FOREMAN DENIED SMELLING ANY FUMES AND, WITHOUT HAVING LOOKED UNDERNEATH AT THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY TRUCK.  A YEAR LATER I RETURNED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAD HIM DOCUMENT THIS VISIT, BUT NOT THE FIRST ONE.  THEIR CONSENSUS REMAINED THE SAME.  FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OTHER DAY, I CRAWLED UNDER MY TRUCK WHILE IT WAS RUNNING, SEEKING AN EXHAUST LEAK.  AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I FOUND.  RECENTLY, MY TRUCK'S WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AND I STILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  TODAY, BILL MARSH FORD SERVICE HAS LOOKED AT THE PROBLEM BASED ON WHAT I FOUND.  I NOW HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEM TO HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PART OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM REPLACED.  WHILE IT IS ONE THING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD HAVE FIXED WHEN IT WAS NEW, OR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER RIGHT AND TESTED AT THE FACTORY, I HAVE A BIGGER CONCERN.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD, SINCE THE EXHAUST FUMES COME INTO THE TRUCK THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS AND THE VENTS.  IT IS ALSO AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE SINCE THE LEAK IS IN FRONT OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  I CANNOT SEE HOW I WAS ALLOWED TO DRIVE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AFTER I REPORTED SMELLING THE FUMES, OR HOW THE TRUCK WAS EVEN ALLOWED TO PASS INSPECTION IF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM WAS COMPLETELY CHECKED.  NOW THAT I HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM WHICH HAS PLAGUED MY TRUCK FROM DAY ONE, AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT THERE IS A CORRECTABLE PROBLEM, I WISH TO PURSUE ANY FURTHER ACTION NECESSARY FOR SUCH A CASE.

OVERTIME THIS ALLOWS WATER TO SEEP IN AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND DRAINS INTO THE DRIVER\u0019S SIDE DASH AREA.  THIS LOCATION HOUSES THE FUSE PANEL AND GEM (GENERIC ELECTRONIC MODULE).  THE WATER THAT ENTERS THE FUSE PANEL AND GEM CAUSES BOTH UNITS TO SHORT OUT, AND COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE A FIRE.  THE EARLY SIGNS OF A PROBLEM ARE THE AC FAN RUNNING WITH THE IGNITION OFF, THE CLOCK ON THE RADIO FLASHING WHEN IT SHOULD BE OFF (IGNITION OFF), AND THE ELECTRIC WINDOWS, DOOR LOCKS, AND POWER MIRRORS TO WORK INTERMITTENTLY.  FORD DEALERS ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND STATE THAT THOUGH FORD MOTOR COMPANY ADMITS USING POOR QUALITY SEALANT, THEY REFUSE TO FIX ANY OF THE FUSE BOXES OR GEMS.  WHILE INSPECTING THE UNDERSIDE OF MY DASH I HAVE ALSO NOTED THAT THE LINKAGE FOR THE BRAKES, PASSING THROUGH THE FIREWALL, IS EXTREMELY RUSTY.

FORD SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED TSB 01-13-5 ON JUNE 26, 2001 WHICH ADVISES REPLACEMENT OF THE MECHANICAL DIODE TYPE CLUTCH WITH THE SPRAG (THE OLD DESIGN).  THIS ISSUE APPLIES TO ALL 4R100 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS BUILT IN THE DATE RANGE ABOVE AND INSTALLED IN (PER THE TSB) E-SERIES, EXCURSIONS, EXPEDITIONS, F-150'S, SUPER DUTY F SERIES, F-53 STRIPPED CHASSIS, AND NAVIGATORS.  AT THE TIME I WAS IN THE FORD DEALERSHIP ANOTHER VEHICLE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WAS ALSO IN THE SHOP.  FORD IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND REFUSES TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  AS THIS FAILURE OCCURS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AND CAUSES SUDDEN AND INSTANT POWER LOSS THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES.  HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HURT, OR KILLED BEFORE FORD WILL STAND BEHIND THEIR DEFECTIVE DESIGN ? *JB *PH",

I CALLED FORD BACK TO REPORT IT AND THEY INSIST THERE IN NO PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH I HAVE 5 FRIENDS WHO HAVE EXPEREINCE THE EXACT PROBLEM IN THEIR F250 TRUCKS. I ALSO REFERRED FORD TO A WEBSITE CHAT THAT INDICATED OVER 200 OF THE SAME PROBLEM ALL AT DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE OWNERSHIP (10K, 25K, 50K MILES) SOME UNDER WARRANTY SOME NOT. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE ENOUGH FOR FORD TO TAKE OWNERSHIP. THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR MY REPAIRS AS WELL AS LOOK INTO THE MATTER. THEY CONTINUE TO PUT THIS PART ON THE TRUCKS KNOWING THEY ARE DEFECTIVE AND CANNONT FUNCTION ONT HE SUPERDUTY TRUCK FRONT ENDS. I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN WITH DIFFERENT FORD MECHANICS WHO ADMIT IT IS A \"KNOWN PROBLEM\" AND THEY KEEP THE PART IN STOCK BECAUSE THEY REPLACE THEM SO MUCH. THE WORD FROM FORD ABOVE IS \"IF IT IS IN WARRANTY FIX IT, IF IT IS OUT CHARGE, AND IF THEY COMPLAIN COMPENSATE\" WHEN ASKED ABOUT POTENTIAL ACCIDENT IT WAS SAID \"THEY WOULD DEAL WITH IT AS THEY ARISE\". I THINK THIS NEED TO BE LOOKED INTO. I AM ONLY OUT $500 BUT SOMEONE ELSE MAY BE OUT ALOT MORE IF THAT FRONT END LOCKS UP GOING 70 DOWN A HIGHWAY.",
