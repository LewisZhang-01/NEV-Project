AS I OPENED THE HOOD, I COULD NOT SEE ANY LEAKS OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF A BROKEN HOSE OR ANYTHING THAT PRODUCED THE SMOKE.      I CHECKED MY FLUID LEVELS AND DISCOVERED THAT MY RADIATOR RESEVOIR WAS LOW ON FLUID.  I THEN PULLED THE ENGINE OIL DIPSTICK AND DISCOVERED A CHOCOLATE MILKY SUBSTANCE ON THE DIPSTICK.  I SUSPECTED THAT THE OIL AND COOLANT HAD MIXED CAUSING MY ENGINE TO FAIL.  I CALLED A WRECKER SERVICE AND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO CLASSIC FORD OF COLUMBIA.  ON MONDAY, 2/12/2018, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DEAN RAY, SERVICE PROFESSIONAL FROM CLASSIC FORD.  MR. RAY TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THE INTERNAL WATER PUMP FAILED CAUSING THE COOLANT AND OIL TO MIX AND POSSIBLE RUINED THE ENGINE AND I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.

THIS INTERNAL WATER PUMP WAS PLACED IN THE 3.5 DURATEC ENGINES IN THE TAURUS, EDGE, FLEX, FUSION, AND POSSIBLY OTHER FORD CARS.  THIS FAILURE ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE A MAJOR ACCIDENT ON A MAJOR INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.  I THINK FORD SHOULD RECALL THESE ENGINES.  MANY AUTO EXPERTS HAVE DISCOVERED THIS ISSUE WITH THE ENGINE.

I WOULD PULL UP TO A STOP SIGN, AND ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE AND I WOULD LOSE ALL POWER FOR APPROX 2 SECONDS AND THEN MY CAR WOULD SLAM INTO GEAR AND TAKE OFF (ALWAYS ON DRY CLEAN PAVEMENT). I AT FIRST DISMISSED THIS ISSUE TO BEING A SENSOR GOING BAD FOR THE ABS SYSTEM. I LATER FOUND THAT DURING THAT TIME SAME PERIOD THE SPEED CONTROL WOULD INTERMITTENTLY STOP WORKING AT VARIOUS PLACES AND TIMES ON STRAIGHTAWAYS OR TURNS WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT SPEED IT WAS SET AT, HOWEVER THIS DID NOT HAPPEN TO MYSELF BUT A RELATION WHO WAS BORROWING MY CAR ON OCCASION. THE LATEST ISSUE WAS WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PULL AWAY FROM A STOP LIGHT 4 NIGHTS AGO AND IT FELT LIKE EITHER MY CAR WAS IN MUCH TOO HIGH OF A GEAR, OR IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING A MANUAL TRANSMISSION I WOULD HAVE SWORN THAT THE CLUTCH HAD GONE BAD AND WAS SLIPPING HORRIBLY. I RELEASED THE ACCELERATOR AND PLACED THE CAR INTO MANUAL SHIFT WHILE COASTING UNDER 5MPH. MY TAURUS LURCHED AND SLAMMED INTO FIRST AND THEN WHEN I BEGAN TO ACCELERATE I PLACED IT BACK INTO DRIVE AND IT SHIFTED FINE ON ITS OWN. I'M HEADED TO THE DEALER LATER THIS WEEK AND AM HOPING TO HAVE THIS ISSUE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND EASILY AFTER HAVING FOUND THE SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS ISSUE ON HERE. I STILL DON'T GET WHY THIS ISN'T A RECALL WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD AN ISSUE, THANKFULLY I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I'M COVERED, OH AND MY TAURUS HAS UNDER 47,000 MILES ON IT SO IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE GOT A ZILLION MILES AND THIS ISSUE POPPED UP, UGH.

HAD BRAKES CHECKED FOR PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THE PADS AND ROTORS WERE IN GOOD SHAPE AND DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF WEAR OR GLAZING.  THE SERVICE TECH SAID THE CALIPERS TESTED GOOD AS WELL.  UPON DRIVING THE CAR ON ANOTHER NIGHT FOR ABOUT 10 MILES, THE BRAKES ACTED UP AGAIN AND I WALKED AROUND FOR A VISUAL CHECK.  NOTICED THE LEFT REAR (DRIVERS SIDE) ROTOR WAS GLOWING RED HOT SO I SNAPPED A PICTURE OF IT WITH MY CELL PHONE.  THE NEXT DAY WE SCHEDULED A SERVICE AT OUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AND I WAS ABLE TO SHOW THEM MY PICTURE.  THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO ORDER A NEW CALIPER AND REAR BRAKE PADS AND WOULD CALL WHEN THEY ARRIVED.  WE FOUND OUT THAT THESE ITEMS ARE ON BACK ORDER FROM FORD.  MEANWHILE, NO CAR WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR US TO DRIVE UNTIL THE REPAIRS CAN BE MADE SO WE ARE STILL DRIVING THE CAR.  MY WIFE NEEDS TO TAKE A BUSINESS TRIP (400 MILES EACH WAY) AND WE ARE NOT SURE IF THIS CAR IS SAFE.  WE ARE ASSUMING THAT FORM MOTOR COMPANY FEELS IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR SINCE A LOANER WAS NOT  OFFERED TO US.  THE BRAKE ROTOR GETS GLOWING RED HOT AND ACTUALLY ILLUMINATES OUR DRIVEWAY AT NIGHT WHEN WE RETURN FROM A TRIP INTO TOWN, WHICH IS ONLY 4 MILES AWAY.  WE ARE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT FUELING THE CAR UP AT A GAS STATION WITH RED HOT STEEL GLOWING AROUND GAS FUMES.  THE HEAT IS SO INTENSE THAT YOU CAN FEEL IT FROM 5 FEET AWAY.  AFTER READING MANY DIFFERENT BRAKE COMPLAINTS I DISCOVERED THAT FORD CANNOT KEEP UP WITH BRAKE PARTS WHICH ARE REGULARLY ON BACK ORDER.  NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE NHTSA HAS NOT FLAGGED THIS ISSUE YET FOR A SAFETY HAZARD.  HOWEVER, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS CAR UNTIL REPAIRS ARE MADE AND HOPE THAT FORD IS CONFIDENT THAT IT IS STILL SAFE TO DRIVE IN THE MEANTIME.  *TR",

THE CAR RAN FINE FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS, BUT STALLED AGAIN, IN THE EXACT SAME MANNER, GOING ABOUT 50 MILES PER HOUR. ONCE AGAIN, AFTER SAFELY NAVIGATING TO THE SHOULDER THE CAR ENGINE STARTED WITHOUT ISSUE. THIS TIME WE TOOK THE CAR TO MANHATTAN FORD AND CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER CARE. FORD CUSTOMER CARE DID NOT CONCEDE ANY ISSUES WITH THE MODEL, AND USED THE SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR REASONING THAT IF THERE WERE A PROBLEM THE MODEL THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL, AND BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RECALL, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. THEREFORE, THEY CONCLUDED, THE ISSUE RESTED SOLELY WITH MY INDIVIDUAL CAR. ON THE OTHER HAND, FORD CUSTOMER CARE WAS LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT REPORTING THE PROBLEM TO THE NHTSA.

LATER, WHEN I SPOKE TO THE FORD CUSTOMER CARE REGIONAL SUPERVISOR [XXX] ON 9/11/13, SHE DISMISSED THE EFFICACY OF NHTSA, DISCOURAGING ME FROM MAKING A REPORT BY STATING THAT IT WOULD NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. FOR THEIR PART, THE MANHATTAN FORD DEALERSHIP SEEMED TO HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF THE SITUATION AND REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY.
