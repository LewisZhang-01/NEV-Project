        "summary": "THIS TRAILER WAS DESIGNED WITH AN IMPROPERLY ENGINEERED FLOOR, THE FLOOR WHICH IS DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED BY CELLTECH METALS DENTS AND DEFLECTS WITH LOAD WHICH CAUSES THE TRAILERS LOAD TO LOOSEN UNDER ITS STRAPS AND MOVE WHILE DRIVING. WE HAD A HEAVY LOAD SHIFT DUE TO THE FLOOR FLEXING CAUSING THE STRAPS TO LOOSEN, THIS SHIFTING OF THE LOAD CAUSED THE TRAILER TO DART RIGHT PUSHING THE BACK OF THE TRUCK INTO ANOTHER LANE. I SPOKE TO THE OWNER OF CELLTECH METALS AND HE SAID THE FLOOR IS STRUCTURAL TO THE TRAILER AND THE FLOOR WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THE USE THAT FORREST RIVER IS USING IT FOR. I ALSO WAS AT THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE TRAILER AND ALL 3 OF THESE TRAILERS THAT THEY HAD SOLD HAD THE SAME ISSUE AND THE OWNERS WERE SELLING THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SAFE. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THESE TRAILERS AS SOMEONE WILL BE KILLED IF NOTHING IS DONE.*DT*DT",
