        "summary": "I WAS IN MY FERRARI CALIFORNIA COMING TO PICK UP MY FRIEND (A DATE). I PULLED THE LITTLE LEVER ON THE LEFT OF THE STEERING WHEEL TO PUT THE CAR INTO PARK. I PULLED IT TWICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAR WAS IN PARK...THAT WAS MY MISTAKE SINCE THE SECOND PULL TOOK THE CAR OUT OF PARK. I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE CAR WAS NOW OUT OF PARK. I CAME TO EXIT THE CAR TO OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR FOR MY DATE. AS I GOT OUT THE CAR STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS DOWN THE SLOPED STREET. I HAD TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE CAR LIKE A STUNTMAN TO SLAM ON THE BREAKS AND PREVENT THE CAR FROM ROLLING DOWN THE STREET AND POSSIBLY KILLING SOMEONE. THE CAR DRIVER DOOR WAS OPEN AS I EXITED THE CAR. IF I DID NOT LEAP BACK INTO THE CAR, I RISKED GETTING RUN OVER SINCE I HAD NOWHERE TO GO AS THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARDS.  I COULD NOT GO FORWARD OR BACK OR TO THE LEFT. MY ONLY OPTION TO PREVENT THE CAR FROM RUNNING ME OVER WAS A HEROIC LEAP BACK INTO THE CAR. THE WAY THIS CAR IS PUT INTO PARK HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. PULLING THAT LEVER SHOULD ALWAYS PUT THE CAR IN PARK. PULLING IT MULTIPLE TIMES SHOULD ENSURE THE CAR IS IN PARK. THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY THE CASE.",
