THESE HEADRESTS OBSCURE VISION SIGNIFICANTLY TO BLOCK SEEING A CHILD, PET, ADULT OR OTHER OBJECT LESS SUBSTANTIAL THAN ANOTHER VEHICLE. I REQUESTED AUDI MAKE PROVISIONS FOR THEIR REMOVAL SINCE MY ONLY REAR PASSENGER IS MY GREAT DANE DOG. AUDI HAS REFUSED TO ASSIST MY DEALERSHIP IN THEIR REMOVAL. I AM CURRENTLY DRIVING A 19991/2 AUDI A4 LOANER CAR THAT HAS CUT OUTS IN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE REAR SEATS THAT ALLOW THE HEAD RESTS TO \"NEST\" SUFFICIENTLY TO AVOID OBSCURING REAR VISION. OBVIOUSLY AUDI IS AWARE OF THE REAR VISION PROBLEMS IN ITS LINES, HOWEVER, THEIR REFUSAL TO HELP OR ASSIST MY DEALER IN PROVIDING ME WITH A CLEAR VISION PATH IS SOMETHING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. MY ISSUE IS CLEARLY SAFETY, HOWEVER, AUDI HAS BEEN TOTALLY NON RESPONSIVE TO ME AND PURPORTEDLY CONTACTS THE DEALER CONCERNING THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO PROVIDE ME WITH A CLEAR VISION PATH. BECAUSE OF AUDI'S INTRANSIGENCE IN SEVERAL SAFETY, MY USE OF A $70,000 AND UTILITY OF THIS VEHICLE IS GREATLY DIMINISHED. AUDI DIRECTED MY DEALER NOT TO INSTALL A REAR BUMPER (RADAR/DRIVER ALERT UNIT) ELECTRONIC PROXIMITY DETECTOR THAT PROVIDES THE DRIVER AUDIBLE AND VISUAL WARNING OF OBJECT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE VEHICLE. INTERESTINGLY AUDI IS MAKING AS STANDARD OR OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE A8 IN YEAR 2000 AN \"AUDIBLE PARKING INDICATOR\" FOR MONITORING THE AREA BEHIND A VEHICLE WHILE IN REVERSE. I CANNOT STATE TOO STRONGLY THAT AUDI AMERICA OWES THEIR CUSTOMERS FREE REPAIR OF THE EGREGIOUS DRIVER BLIND SPOTS AND REAR VISION OBSTRUCTION. AUDI MAINTAINS THAT NO PROBLEM EXISTS, WILL DO NOTHING TO AID THE CONSUMER, AND AUDI APPARENTLY DIRECTED MY DEALER NOT TO INSTALL EITHER VISION ENHANCEMENTS (MIRRORS) OR THE AUDIBLE BACK UP PROXIMITY DETECTOR I PURCHASED FOR $350.00. APPARENTLY AUDI'S POSITION TO MY DEALER IS: THE A8 CAR PASSED ITS SAFETY TESTS AS DELIVERED, AND ANY CHANGES WOULD BE UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS. I SINC",
