I WENT OUT TO AIR IT UP AND WHILE AIRING IT UP I NOTICED A PLY SEPARATION ON THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE. SO I PUT THE \"DONUT\" ON AND TOOK IT TO THE SHOP THE NEXT DAY TO REPLACE THAT TIRE, ONLY TO BE INFORMED THAT ANOTHER TIRE WAS WORSE THAN THE ONE I INDICATED. SO NOT TRUSTING THE FOURTH TIRE I HAD THE THREE ORIGINAL TIRES REPLACED.  THESE TIRES WERE GOODYEAR, THE ORIGINAL TIRES THAT CAME ON THE CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT NEW.

I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO BE FOUND BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS PROBLEM NEVER COMES UP AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THE TECHS CAN NEVER DUPLICATE IT.  OUR TECH TOLD US THIS MORNING THAT IF THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING AGAIN THIS TIME, THEN I WILL  MOST LIKELY HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH THE TECH TO SEE IF I CAN DUPLICATE IT. I'M HOPING THIS CAN FINALLY BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT BECAUSE MY CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL COME OF IT.

I CALLED AAA AND THEN LANG'S AUTO DEALERSHIP TO MAKE SURE I COULD GET THE CAR IN ON A SATURDAY. AAA RESPONDED QUICKLY AND REPLACED THE FUSE FOR THE FUEL PUMP SINCE THIS WAS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE, THE FIRST WHILE DRIVING. THE CAR WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO LANG'S.

DOC ID 2585199 LOCATION K-16. HAD SEVERAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH LANG'S SERVICE AND DISCOVERED THAT THE MECHANIC KNEW THE FIX SINCE HE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO REPORT THIS TO GM TO HOPEFULLY CREATE A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE.    FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER:  THE WIRING REPAIR WAS DONE AT A CONNECTOR IN THE RIGHT LOWER HUSH PANEL AREA BY THE LOWER DOOR HINGE.  THE TECHNICIAN FOUND THIS DO TO EXPERIENCE AND PROPER DIAGNOSIS.  THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU DID TO CREATE THE PROBLEM. IT WAS NOT CORRECTLY MANUFACTURED FROM THE SUPPLIER OF THE HARNESS/CONNECTOR.
