I was lucky no one was coming the opposite direction on the 2 lane road cause I wouldn't have been able to control truck even at 40mph, another 5min and I would have been on the interstate going 65mph and surely I'd be dead. After a week I was able to go out and look at my truck thats when I noticed the flat front passenger tire was flat and the inner ring of the rim came off. I had an accident investigator look at it , I hired a lawyer and a metallurgical expert to examine rim. There was no warning the rims were still new.",

The new shift cable burned into has I was backing in my driveway. I did research on the internet for trucks in that year range and it included other trucks 2007 and 2008 F150 having the same issue. You can find a ton of utube videos . ShowIng mechanics finding solutions to prevent the shift cables from burning into. I contacted Ford motor company about it. Ford wanted me to take the truck to a dealership and let them diagnosed the problem. The dealership wanted me to pay them a 150 dollars to look at it. I was not going to pay them for something that I already knew the answer too. So it is a manufacturing flaw with the way Ford put the shift cable on 2006 F150 and other F150's in that year range.

I WAS DRIVING DOWN VT116 (A HILLY, WINDING 2 LANE COUNTRY HIGHWAY WITH NO SHOULDER)  IN THE RAIN AT ABOUT 40MPH WHEN MY TRUCK STARTED TO BUCK AND LOSE POWER. THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PULL OVER, SO I PUT MY HAZARDS ON AND TRIED TO LIMP IT TO A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER. THE ENGINE STALLED AND I LOST STEERING AND BRAKING POWER ON A CURVE. I APPLIED THE BRAKES MANUALLY AND WRESTLED THE STEERING WHEEL (WHICH NO LONGER HAD ANY POWER ASSIST). WITH MAJOR DIFFICULTY, I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE TRUCK TO A CONTROLLED STOP. I WAS THEN ABLE TO RESTART THE ENGINE, LIMPED ALONG AT 15MPH, BUCKING AND STALLING 3 MORE TIMES BEFORE GETTING TO A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER.     THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD MY FCM REPLACED (PRIOR WAS 1/5/2013) AND THE SECOND TIME I ALMOST CRASHED MY TRUCK BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT. THE PREVIOUS TIME WAS JANUARY 2013 ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD IN WINTER ON SNOW. IF I WAS TOWING MY BOAT ON THE INTERSTATE AND LOST ALL POWER, I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN KILLED ALONG WITH ANYONE AROUND ME.    WHY IS IT A DESIGN DEFECT? BECAUSE THIS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT IS INSTALLED IN A WEATHER-EXPOSED AREA ABOVE THE SPARE TIRE AND IS NOT CORROSION-PROOF. IN ANY RUST BELT STATE (OR A PLACE EXPOSED TO SALT), THE CASE WILL CORRODE, EXPOSING THE CIRCUIT BOARD TO WATER, CAUSING THE UNIT TO FAIL.    WHY IS IT A SAFETY CONCERN? BECAUSE WHEN THE FCM FAILS, THE ENGINE WILL STALL, CAUSING A LOSS OF POWER TO THE STEERING AND BRAKING SYSTEMS.     NHTSA SHOULD FORCE FORD TO DO A MANDATORY RECALL AND REDESIGN THIS POORLY DESIGNED PART. EVEN THE REPLACEMENT PARTS FAIL AFTER A FEW YEARS.

THE FUEL PRESSURE WAS OPERATING AT 90 PSI.  AFTER SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL VISITS, IT WAS EVENTUALLY DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE WAS SEVERELY CORRODED AND MALFUNCTIONING.  THE \"POT\" METAL HAS BEEN COMPLETELY CORRODED AND THERE IS AN APPROXIMATE 1 INCH DIAMETER HOLE LEADING DIRECTLY TO THE ELECTRIC PANEL.  THE CONTROL MODULE WAS REPLACED FOR AN ADDITIONAL $399.89.  THE DESIGN OF THIS MODULE USING \"POT\" METAL AND SIMPLY BOLTING TO THE STEEL AXLE IS RIDICULOUS.  THIS ITEM SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE RECALL WITHIN THE \"SALT BELT\" AREAS OF NORTH AMERICA.  I HAVE DOCUMENTED RECEIPTS FROM THE REPAIR SHOP AND HAVE KEPT THE ORIGINAL FUEL MODULE AS WELL.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS ISSUE AS AN OBVIOUS RE-CALL ITEM AND BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSOCIATED REPAIR BILLS.  *TR",

THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PULL OVER, AS THE SHOULDERS OF THE ROAD WERE NOT CLEARED AND THERE WAS 12\" OF WET HEAVY SNOW.  MY TRUCK IS NOT 4WD SO WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN STUCK.  WE HAD TO DRIVE WITH THE HAZARDS ON, BUT IT WAS LOW VISIBILITY AND WE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN HIT FROM BEHIND.  WE COULD NOT GET OFF ON THE EXIT RAMP BECAUSE A SEMI TRUCK JACKNIFED AND THE EXIT WAS CLOSED.  WE HAD TO CONTINUE THIS HAZARDOUS JOURNEY TO THE NEXT EXIT, WHICH WAS ABOUT 12 MILES AWAY, TO STEWARTVILLE, MN.  WE FOUND A AUTO REPAIR SHOP AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM.  THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE.  HE SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN INSTALLING A LOT OF THESE LATELY ON F150S, ESPECIALLY 2006'S.  HE SAID HE FELT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL, AS IT IS WELL-KNOWN AMONG MECHANICS THAT THESE ARE FAILING AT AN ALARMING RATE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MODULE IS LOCATED TIGHT AGAINST THE FRAME, NEXT TO THE SPARE TIRE, AND THE METAL OF THE MODULE (ALUMINUM) REACTS ADVERSELY WITH THE STEEL METAL OF THE FRAME, CAUSING OXIDATION BETWEEN THE TWO.  THIS CAUSES THE MODULE TO BREAK AND FAIL, THUS SHORTING OUT THE CIRCUIT BOARD.  FORD KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM, AS THE REPLACEMENT PARTS HAVE SPACER PLATES TO KEEP THE MODULE & FRAME SEPARATED.  FORD SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL ON THIS PART BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  WE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN KILLED, AS WE COULD NOT PULL OFF THE INTERSTATE.

WHILE BACKING UP GIVING JUST A LITTLE GAS MY BOOT SHOE LACE PEG GOT TRAPPED BEHIND THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WAS HOLDING MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL DEPRESSING IT DOWN. BECAUSE THE RUBBER RIDGE RUNS ALL THE WAY AROUND MY PEDAL (AS DESIGNED) I COULD NOT MOVE MY FOOT TO THE SIDE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL TO RELEASE THE GAS.  BECAUSE OF THE THICKNESS OF MY FOOT WHEN I PRESSED THE BREAK WITH MY OTHER FOOT, IT MOVES THE GAS PEDAL DOWN AT THE SAME RATE AS MY FOOT IS TRAPPED,  SO THE MORE YOU PRESS THE BRAKE THE MORE YOU GIVE GAS AT A RATIO THAT DOES NOT LET ME STOP THE VEHICLE.  (NOTE I USE ONLY ONE FOOT FOR THE GAS AND BRAKE NORMALLY BUT WITH MY RIGHT FOOT TRAPPED I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO USE MY LEFT FOOT TO BRAKE AND TRY TO GET IT THE TRUCK OUT OF GEAR .  I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING IN TIME AND HIT A STATIONARY BUILDING.  IF SOMEONE WAS BEHIND ME, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.    THE ONLY OTHER WAY I COULD HAVE GOTTEN MY FOOT LOOSE IS TO DEPRESS THE GAS PEDAL WHICH IS NOT AN OPTION IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE THE SPEED OF THE IMPENDING IMPACT FASTER AND HARDER.    THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT TRAPS WORK BOOTS AND AT CERTAIN TIMES AND CAUSES LOOSE CONTROL.  *TR",

ALL THEY WOULD DO IS OFFER ME THE \"X PLAN\" ON A NEW VEHICLE. NOW, WHY WOULD I WANT TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE. I'VE BEEN RAISED ON FORD VEHICLES MY ENTIRE LIFE. I MUST SAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST FORD TRUCK FOR SURE. A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A TOYOTA TRUCK AND HAS OVER 200K MILES. NEVER HAS HAD A ISSUE WITH ANYTHING. PLEASE ADVISE ON WHAT TO DO, THIS NEEDS TO STOP AND FORD NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. BUT I HAVE A FEELING THEY WON'T OR THEY WOULD OF DONE IT ALREADY.  *TR",

I BOUGHT MY LAST 3 TRUCKS FROM NORTH COUNTY FORD, IN VISTA, CALIFORNIA.  MY 3RD TRUCK WAS A BRAND NEW 2006 FORD F150, AND ALL 3 TRUCKS I BOUGHT FROM NORTH COUNTY FORD, I PAID EXTENDED WARRANTY ON EACH ONE OF THEM, AND THAT WAS OVER $9,000, AND I NEVER USED 1 PENNY OF IT, I NEVER NEEDED ANY WARRANTY OR EXTENDED WARRANTY WORK UNTIL NOW, FOR THE FAULTY LEAKY PLASTIC GAS FUEL TANK UNDER MY TRUCK.        I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY MY GAS GAUGE SAID LOW FUEL, WHEN I HAD JUST PUT FUEL IN THE TRUCK THE SAME DAY.  WHEN I STARTED MY TRUCK, I SMELLED GAS, SO I GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK, AND COULD SEE IT COMING OUT OF THE FUEL TANK AREA.  I WENT TO THE GAS STATION WITH THE LOW FUEL LIGHT ON, BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET HOME BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED, AND I PUT MORE FUEL IN THE TRUCK, AND JUST GOING ONLY 15 MILES THE GAS DISAPPEARED AND THE LOW FUEL LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, BUT I DID GET IT HOME.  I JACKED UP THE TRUCK AND STARTED IT, AND CLIMBED UNDERNEATH, AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT WAS A PLASTIC BLACK FUEL TANK, NOT STEEL OR METAL.  I WAS JUST LIKE A CHEAP SWIMMING POOL THAT YOU WOULD PUT TWO OF THEM TOGETHER, AND YOU WOULD SEAL IT IN THE MIDDLE TO MAKE A TANK.  BUT THE SEAL IS NOW BROKE, AND IM TRYING TO PUT SOME PLASTIC SEAL ON IT, BUT EVERYTHING I READ ON THE INTERNET, TOLD ME FORD WAS ALREADY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE I PUT AN AD UP ON CRAIGSLIST UNDER THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTION, ASKING MECHANICS FOR HELP ON WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO SUCH A NEW TRUCK.  ITS NOT LIKE I RAN OVER SOMETHING, AS THAT WOULD OF MADE A HOLE IN THE TANK, AND I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT BEING MY FAULT, BUT THE SEAMS COMING APART, AND THE GAS JUST GOING ALL OVER THE GROUND.  THIS IS AN EXTREME FIRE HAZARD, AND DONT BE SURPRISED IF THIS THING CATCHES ON FIRE ON ME, HOPEFULLY NOT?",

I CHECKED UNDER THE TRUCK AND UNDER THE HOOD AND FOUND NOTHING UNUSUAL.  I STARTED THE TRUCK AND DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING EITHER.  THERE WAS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANY OTHER VISUAL REFERENCE TO INDICATE THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  I GOT BACK ON THE HIGHWAY AND DROVE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS (100 MILES) AND EXITED THE HIGHWAY.  WHILE ON THE EXIT RAMP I APPLIED THE BRAKES ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THEY WERE EXTREMELY HARD  TO DEPRESS AND WERE INEFFECTIVE.  I MANAGED TO GUIDE THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY  APPLYING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND GEARING DOWN AND WAS ABLE TO STOP BEFORE HITTING VEHICLES STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AT THE END OF THE RAMP.  I DISCOVERED LATER (AFTER BEING TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP) THAT THE VACUUM LINE FROM THE INTAKE MANIFOLD HAD RUPTURED (OCCURRED WHEN THE VEHICLE BACKFIRED) LEAVING NO POWER ASSIST FOR THE BRAKES.  THERE WAS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  THERE WAS NO BRAKE WARNING LIGHT.  THERE WERE NO CODES FROM THE ON BOARD DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER.  I HAD TRAVELED FOR 2 HOURS AND 100 MILES WITH NO BRAKES UNAWARE OF THE EXISTING HAZARD.  THE DEALER COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF ANY WARNING.  I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE TRUCK AND AVOID AN ACCIDENT.  *TR",

IT WILL GO TO THE FLOOR.  DOORS WONT SHUT WITHOUT SLAMMING. SUPER CAB DOORS WONT SHUT TIGHT WITHOUT PUSHING TOP IN. MY BEST FUEL ECONOMY IS 13 MPG HIGHWAY WITH THE CRUISE ON. THE \"NEW\" F150'S ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORD NAME. $ 38,000 P.O.S. !! MY LAST FORD.  *NM",

UPON REACHING MY DESTINATION I ASKED MY ASSOCIATE TO OBSERVE THE STEERING COMPONENTS WHILE I TURNED THE WHEEL WITH THE ENGINE OFF.  HE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE ENTIRE RACK AND PINION ASSEMBLY SHIFTING BACK AND FORTH.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I FOUND THAT OF THE TWO BOLTS THAT HOLD THE UNIT TO THE CHASSIS ONE HAD A LOOSE NUT AND THE OTHER HAD NO NUT AT ALL.  THE THREADS ON THE BOLT W/O THE NUT APPEARED TO NEVER HAVE EVEN HAD A NUT BUT I CAN NOT BE SURE OF THIS.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS A LITTLE MORE THAN UPSET THAT I HAD PUT MYSELF AND OTHERS AT GREAT RISK OVER POOR ASSEMBLY QUALITY CONTROL.  *JB",
