        "summary": "What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request?  Throttle Body motor failure due to permanent magnet adhesive failure. Magnets detached from motor casing and wrapped around the armature. I have pictures and it is available for inspection. How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk?  Failed at highway speed, 70 mph, causing extreme deceleration and almost a rear ender from following truck. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Repair shop mechanic confirmed throttle body failure and replaced it with new one. Told me this is a common occurrence on ford f450 v10s. He worked for Ford for twenty years and saw a lot of failures. Many were the sensor but also the gearing and failure due to dirty components. He didn't mention the magnets. It was difficult to move the butterflies and he said it might be the gears are damaged or worn. He didn't disassemble the throttle body but gave it to me to look at. I found the problem.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others?  No Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? Yes, immediately the check engine light and the orange wrench appeared when it failed. No prior indicators of a problem occurred.  Here's partial report on same problem from RV site: Thor Owners Club Ford Super Duty Owner, Engine would not respond to accelerator pedal, idle was OK, fault codes P2112 and P2104.With the engine off and key off the butter flies were very stiff and difficult to move by hand. This confirmed the P2112 code, stuck throttle, and the P2104, forced idle. When I pulled the throttle servo motor cover found one of the motor magnetics had come unglued and was jamming the motor. Re-glued with two part epoxy, clean the assembly and reinstalled. Fault codes cleared. Engine ran normally.",

TIRE TREAD PEELED OFF THE ENTIRE THING EXCEPT FOR AN APPROXIMATELY 10 INCH STRIP. IT DESTROYED THE GAS INTAKE LINE. GOOD THING WE DIDN'T HAVE ALOT OF GAS IN THE TANK. A FEW MONTHS AGO HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN WITH ANOTHER BFG TIRE (WE BOUGHT 3 OF THEM). THAT ONE CRUSHED THE EXHAUST PIPE. AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T ATTRIBUTE IT TO A DEFECTIVE TIRE BUT AFTER 2 OUT OF 3 BLOWOUTS WE WILL HAVE THE 3RD ONE TAKEN OFF AS SOON AS WE CAN GET THE GAS INTAKE REPLACED & CAN GET TO A TIRE DEALER. WE CALLED BFG & THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT...THEY WANT US TO SEND THEM THE TIRE!!! OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SAID DON'T SEND IT.  *TR",
