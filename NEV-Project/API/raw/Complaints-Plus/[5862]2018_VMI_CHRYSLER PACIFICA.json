WE WERE ABLE TO WRESTLE THE CAR INTO A BUSINESS PARKING LOT. RESTARTED THE CAR WITHOUT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM RETURNING. A RED STEERING WHEEL WITH! APPEARED ON THE DASH. AFTER APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME WE CONTACTED THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP. WE RESTARTED THE CAR AND ALL THE ELECTRICAL PROCESSES INCLUDING STEERING WORKED. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY CHECKED THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AND CONFIRMED THE LOSS OF ELECTRIC CONNECTION. WE WERE ALSO INFORMED THAT EVERYTHING AT THIS TIME IS NOW WORKING CORRECTLY. ONE WEEK PRIOR, THE SAFETY RECALL HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND THIS WAS CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE CORRECTLY DONE. WE ARE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AGAIN WITH SOME TREPIDATION.",
