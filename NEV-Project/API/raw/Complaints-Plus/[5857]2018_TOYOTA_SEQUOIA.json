HOWEVER, AFTER THE SERVICE, WHEN I CHECKED THE PAPERWORK, I FOUND OUT THAT THE PENDING SAFETY RECALL (MANUFACTURER RECALL: 20TA02, NHTSA RECALL: 20V012) WAS NOT FIXED AND IT WAS CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE NO SAFETY RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VEHICLE (SEE THE ATTACHED PAPERWORK).    I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE AMERICAN TOYOTA AND THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE DIDN'T GIVE ME A REASONABLE REASON SO I DEMANDED TO TALK A MANAGER. THE MANAGER DIDN'T KNOW WHY THE SAFETY RECALL WAS NOT FIXED SO HE PROMISED TO DO SOME INVESTIGATIONS AND GET BACK TO ME.  LATER, A SENIOR MANAGER FROM THE AMERICAN TOYOTA CALLED ME AND GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING REASONS FOR NOT FIXING THE SAFETY RECALL:        -  I SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T ASK FOR SAFETY RECALL TO BE FIXED      -  AMERICAN TOYOTA DIDN'T HAVE A CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME TO FIX THE SAFETY RECALL      -  AMERICAN TOYOTA MADE FALSE STATEMENT ON THE SERVICE PAPERWORK THAT THERE WAS NO SAFETY RECALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE VEHICLE    WHEN I TALKED TO THE SENIOR SERVICE MANAGER AT AMERICAN TOYOTA, HE PROMISED TO GET THE DATABASE AND PAPERWORK UPDATED SOON BUT AS OF TODAY (THREE WEEKS LATER) I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CORRECTED PAPERWORK FROM THE AMERICAN TOYOTA.
