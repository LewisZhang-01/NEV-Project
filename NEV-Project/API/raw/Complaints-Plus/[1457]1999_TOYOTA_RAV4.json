THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE ARRIVED WITHIN 10 MINUTES AND CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE WAS SEATED IN THE CENTRAL DASH AREA.   THE KEYS WERE BESIDE BY BED. THE CAR HAD ONLY BEEN SERVICED BY TOYOTA SERVICE CENTERS AND THERE WERE NO MODIFICATIONS TO THE CAR. WHEN TOYOTA WERE NOTIFIED, THEY SENT INVESTIGATORS TO LOOK FOR A RELAY NEAR THE ALTERNATOR.

I SPOKE WITH A JIM CHRISTENSEN ,773-622-6300 X 4911.  HE IS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. AFTER A WEEK I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE MY CAR WAS 6 YEARS OLD AND HAD 64,000 MILES ON IT THAT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS NOT A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. BUT THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE, AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW, AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY AFTER MARKET INSTALLATIONS OF ANY KIND. I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE DAMAGE THAT CAN MAILED UPON REQUEST. DAMAGE WAS CAUSED TO  FRONT RIGHT SIDE, HEAD LIGHTS, WIRING BURNED AND WASHER RESERVOIR. THE BACK TAIL LIGHTS AND INTERIOR LIGHTS DON'T WORK ANY MORE. ALSO A FAN IN THE ENGINEER KEEPS RUNNING WHICH CAUSES MY BATTERY TO RUN DOWN. MY CAR WAS IN PREFECT RUNNING CONDITION UP UNTIL THIS HAPPENED. THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH @ TOYOTA REGARDING THIS INCIDENT IS TROY H. HIGA, 310-468-5638.
