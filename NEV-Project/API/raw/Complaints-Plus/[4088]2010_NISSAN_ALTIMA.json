I took it to one Nissan dealership and they said not a manufacturing defect, but gave me a quote of $3500 to repair.  Took to another Nissan dealership and they gave me another quote for a repair using a dash from the junk yard for 1/2 the price.  I gave up and finally purchased a dash cover in August 2019 for around $300 from carparts.com and installed it myself.  Very much a driving/safety concern! The sunroof leaks if more than a sprinkle.  The back floor board stand in 3\" of water.  I have to take it to the dealership to have the headliner ripped out to clean the waterline from sunroof to outside (rear wheel well).  I have taken it in 2-3 times at a cost of ~$150 each time.  I need to go back now, but have currently duct taped the sunroof shut. The VDC and slip light, brake light and tire pressure lights are on.  Have had them reset.  Last time they told me to disregard the brake light. Just ignore it.",

I HAD THE CAR TOWED AND THE WRECKER  TRIED TO DRIVE THE CAR ONTO THE TOW TRUCK BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET IT UP THE BED AS IT DIDNT HAVE ANY POWER TO DRIVE UP THE BED. I TOOK IT TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHO RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND STATED THAT THERE WERE NO CODES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. THEY STATED IT WAS RUNNING JUST FINE, AND COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE SAME ISSUE.

NAMELY, THE SWITCH THAT OPERATES THE BRAKE LIGHTS FAILS INTERMITTENTLY.  WHEN IT FAILS THE BRAKE LIGHTS WON'T ILLUMINATE WHEN THE DRIVER STEPS ON THE BRAKE.  THIS IS A REAR END COLLISION WAITING TO HAPPEN!  DOES THE NHTSA HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS KILLED BEFORE REQUIRING A MANUFACTURER TO FIX A DEFECT THAT BOTH THE MANUFACTURER AND NHTSA KNEW ABOUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS?    TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, WHEN THE SWITCH FAILS THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE DISABLED POSING AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY RISK.    TO MAKE MATTER WORSE, WHEN THE SWITCH FAILS THE CAR WON'T START.  WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE STUCK IN A DARK, DESERTED AREA AT 2 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN YOUR CAR DECIDED NOT TO START?    AS I SAID BEFORE, THE MANUFACTURER HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS.   IN RESPONSE TO THE DELUGE OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS,  IN NOVEMBER OF 2010 NISSAN ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEFECT BY ISSUING A TSB (NTB10-139) TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

EACH TIME, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPRESS, AND THE CAR MADE CLICKING SOUNDS WHEN THE START PUSH BUTTON WAS PRESSED. SEVERAL JUMP STARTS AFTER THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, ON A SUNDAY, I DECIDED TO TRY REPLACING THE BATTERY. BECAUSE NISSAN'S SERVICE CENTER WERE NOT OPEN IN MY AREA, I PURCHASED A NEW BATTERY FROM A RETAIL STORE. WHEN I PHONED NISSAN'S SERVICE CENTER THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE I DID NOT BRING THE VEHICLE TO THEM (THEY WANTED THE ENTIRE CAR, NOT JUST THE BATTERY, EVEN THOUGH THE NISSAN SHOP WAS CLOSED), I WAS NOT ENTITLED TO A PRORATED REFUND ON THE OLD BATTERY. APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 - 2 YEARS LATER, THE SAME PROBLEM BEGAN TO HAPPEN AGAIN. AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR OVER AN HOUR IN AN ATTEMPT TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY, I SWUNG BY A NISSAN DEALER, WHO TESTED THE NEW BATTERY AND ADVISED THAT IT WAS AT ABOUT 40%. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TURN EVERYTHING OFF, INCLUDING THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS, BECAUSE \"ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES DRAIN THE BATTERY.\" WHAT'S THE POINT IN HAVING AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS IF I HAVE TO SHUT THEM OFF? I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH A VEHICLE BEFORE, AND BATTERIES SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN THIS, ESPECIALLY IN A BRAND NEW CAR. WHEN THIS FIRST BEGAN OCCURRING, THE CAR HAD APPROXIMATELY 20,000 MILES ON IT. AT THIS TIME, THIS CAR HAS LESS THAN 35,000 MILES ON IT. THE NISSAN DEALER WHO TESTED THE BATTERY TOLD ME THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL (AND I SEE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE), BUT THAT NISSAN IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  *TR",

THE PART NEEDED IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. CUSTOMER CARE/NISSAN ADVISES THAT THE CAR IS DRIVE-ABLE, BUT FOR NOT LONG PERIODS OF TIME.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS CAR WAS DESIGNED WITHOUT THIS PART.

THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO PARK THE CAR AND WAIT FOR IT TO COOL,THUS RESETTING THE DEFAULT MODE. AT THIS POINT NISSAN HAS ADVISED TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR A CODE SCAN.

IN FEBRUARY 2014 WITH APPROXIMATELY 38,000 MILES, THE IGNITION STARTED TO STOP WORKING. AFTER A FEW STRUGGLES, THE IGNITION BUTTON WOULD FINALLY ALLOW ME TO START THE ENGINE.

I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKES WOULD SUCK IN SO HARD THAT I  WOULD BE UNABLE TO \"PRESS\" THE BRAKES ANYMORE IN ORDER FOR THE IGNITION BUTTON TO \"ENABLE\" SO I CAN START THE ENGINE.

AFTER 2 HOURS OF STRUGGLING, WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE \"BRAKES LIGHT\" ON AND THE IGNITION WOULD FINALLY BECOME ENABLED AND WE WERE ABLE TO START THE ENGINE.

I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND SAW SO MANY DRIVERS ARE COMPLAINING THE SAME THING AND THAT NISSAN IS REFUSING TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT IS A \"COMMON PROBLEM\" THAT THEY COULD MAKE A PROFIT OUT OF THE REPAIRS CHARGES.

THE CAR HAS BEEN TO THE NISSAN DEALER 2-TIMES AND BOTH TIMES THEY REMOVED OIL,CLAIMING THE EXCESS OIL CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION TO OVERHEAT WHICH PUT IT INTO THE SAFE MODE.  ON DEC. 31,2013 WE WERE ON A RETURN TRIP OF 70 MILES OR SO WHEN WE EXITED THE FREEWAY. WE CAME TO A STOP AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL AND UPON TRYING TO ACCELERATE,THE TRANSMISSION ONCE AGAIN WENT IN THE SAFE MODE,HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO ACCELERATE ACROSS THE INTERSECTION.  WE SLOWLY DROVE THE SHORT DISTANCE HOME PARKING THE CAR.  IN THE PAST,WE PARKED THE CAR ALLOWING IT TO COOL SO IT WOULD \"RESET\" BUT THIS TIME THE CAR REMAINED IN THE SAFE MODE THE NEXT DAY. WE HAD IT TOWED TO NISSAN. NISSAN CLAIMS THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND OUR CAR IS READY FOR PICKUP. THIS TRANSMISSION FAILS WITHOUT WARNING AND UPON DOING SO MAKES IT ACCELERATE VERY,VERY SLOWLY WHICH PUTS US IN GRAVE DANGER.

THE ABS AND FLIP LIGHTS WOULD BLINK AND THE BATTERY WOULD POWER UP BUT THE CAR ON THE PUSH BUTTON IGNITION WOULD NOT RESPOND WHICH WOULD START THE CAR, I CALLED THE TOWING COMPANY AND I WAS CHARGED $173 FOR TOWING TO THE DEALER AS THE MECHANIC WAS NOT ABLE TO START THE VEHICLE EITHER.    THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALER STATING THE BRAKE PEDAL SWITCH WHICH WHEN PRESSED WITH THE KEY FOB IN THE VEHICLE ALLOWS THE CAR TO BE STARTED WHEN PRESSING THE PUSH BUTTON IGNITION SWITCH; THAT SWITCH ATTACHED TO THE BRAKE HARNESS HAD GONE BAD AND I WAS GIVEN A COST OF $232.64 TO REPLACE THIS SWITCH.    THE DEALER STATED THAT HE WAS SHOWING IN HIS SYSTEM THAT THIS SWITCH WAS REDESIGNED RECENTLY AND THE NEW REDESIGNED SWITCH WHICH WOULD INCLUDE REPLACING THE BRAKE PEDAL HARNESS ALSO WOULD COST ME A TOTAL OF $531.17 AND HE STATED THAT HE RECOMMENDS THE NEW REDESIGNED SWITCH OVER THE LESSER EXPENSIVE SAME TYPE OF SWITCH THAT WENT BAD WHICH WOULD BE AT RISK OF GOING BAD AGAIN SOON.    I ESCALATED THE ISSUE TO NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT 1-800-NISSAN-1, CASE #10255931. I REQUESTED THEM TO COVER THE EXPENSE AS I HAD EXCEEDED THE MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY ONLY BY 3000 MILES AND HAD BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW IN MAY, 2010. THEY RESEARCHED THE MATTER AND DECLINED TO COVER THE EXPENSE DUE TO A PREVIOUS BRAKE ROTOR ISSUE I HAD ESCALATED TO THEM 3 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS A SEPARATE ISSUE.    I HOPE NO ONE ELSE IS STRANDED AS WE WERE WITH MY WIFE, MY TWIN 3 YEAR OLD BOYS, AND MYSELF AT 11:30PM AT NIGHT FAR AWAY DUE TO A BLOWN OUT SWITCH WHICH HAS NOW BEEN REDESIGNED, I AM ASKING THAT A RECALL ON THIS BE OPENED UP.  *TR",
