NAVISTAR ON BEHALF OF MONACO RV WAS NAMED RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECTING THIS DEFECT.  MONACO COACH (A DEFUNCT COMPANY ACQUIRED BY NAVISTAR) INSTALLED THESE SAME TRANSFER SWITCHES IN LIKE MODEL MOTOR HOMES PRIOR TO THEIR FAILURE.  FOR THOSE OF US WITH THESE DEFECTIVE SWITCHES INSTALLED BY MONACO COACH AND NOT MONACO RV WE ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED ANY PROTECTION BY THE NHTSA FOR A KNOWN PROBLEM.  WHY HASN'T THE NHTSA NAMED IOTA ENGINEERING AS RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THESE DEFECTIVE SWITCHES?  IOTA ENGINEERING CLAIMS THE FAILURES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MONACO'S INSTALLATION (MONACO RV AND MONACO COACH).  IN AT LEAST ONE CASE, PROBABLY OTHERS, THE FAILURE IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO IOTA ENGINEERING AND NOT THE INSTALLER OF THEIR PRODUCT.  THIS LINK CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES A FAILURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT AND NOT THE INSTALLATION OF THE PRODUCT; HTTP://WWW.IRV2.COM/FORUMS/F115/REPLACING-IOTA-50R-TRANSFER-SWITCH-120387.HTML .    MY TRANSFER SWITCH HAS NOT YET FAILED.  I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT IT MAY AND SHOULD BE PART OF A RECALL WITH IOTA ENGINEERING BEING NAMED RESPONSIBLE.  *TR",
