ERROR MESSAGE DOES APPEAR WHEN TRIALER IS PLUGGED UP. 2010 DODGE 3500 WILL WORK WITH TRAILERS THAT USE ELECTRIC OVER HYDRAULIC BRAKES AND 2012 MODELS WILL WORK. WHEN I CONTACTED DODGE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND RESEARCH THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS MODEL TRUCK IS TO PUT A AFTER MARKET BRAKE CONTROLLER ON THE TRUCK. THIS WILL VOID THE WARRANTY ON THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  *TT",
