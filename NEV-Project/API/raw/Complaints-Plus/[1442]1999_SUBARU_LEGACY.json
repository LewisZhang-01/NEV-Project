THIS CAUSED SMOKE TO COME FROM OIL BURNING ON THE HOT EXHAUST MANIFOLD. AFTER OWNING THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS, I HAD THE OIL CHANGED AND NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE STILL SMOKES AROUND THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD AFTER DRIVING IT. I CAN ALSO HEAR OIL DRIPPING FROM THE FILTER ONTO THE MANIFOLD. WHILE ONLINE REVIEWING MY CAR INSURANCE, I NOTICED THAT THIS VERY PROBLEM IS A RECALL DEFECT. I FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS AND CALLED SUBARU ABOUT THIS. THE REPRESENTATIVE NAMED PATRICIA SAID THAT THERE WAS NO RECALLS FOR THIS VEHICLE AND QUICKLY ENDED THE CONVERSATION. I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE AND NEED THIS ADDRESSED. MY WIFE AND BABY RIDE IN THIS CAR.  THE RECALL # IS -98V127000. THANK YOU. *TR",

THE VEHICLE HIT A PATCH OF BLACK ICE AND SWERVED OUT OF CONTROL IMPACTING THE K-RAIL DIVIDER WALL ON THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT @ 55 MPH.  THE INERTIA GENERATED BY THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT THEN CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO SLINGSHOT BACK ACROSS THE INTERSTATE AND IMPACT W/ THE OVERPASS WALL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT @ 45 MPH.   THE SRS AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.    I HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES AT THE DEALEARSHIP THAT BOTH OF THE AIRBAG SENSORS IN THE FRONT BUMPER MUST BE TRIGGERED AT THE SAME TIME IN ORDER TO DEPLOY THE AIRBAGS.  BOTH SENSORS WERE TRIGGERED, JUST NOT AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.  I FEEL THAT THE SENSORS SHOULD OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER AND EACH SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRIGGER THE AIRBAGS.  MY WIFE AND I FEEL THAT THIS CONSTITUTES A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING KILLED IN A CRASH AND THE AIRBAGS FAIL TO DEPLOY.  THE VEHICLE IS AT FIGGS IMPORTS, INC. IN TOPEKA, KANSAS.  THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS 785-267-2390.  WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE A QUICK RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT.  THANK YOU.",
