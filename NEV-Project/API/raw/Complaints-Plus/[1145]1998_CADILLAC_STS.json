MINE IS A 1998 STS, NOW WITH 80K MILES. IT IS NOT SIMPLY A BULB REPLACEMENT BECAUSE IT IS A SEALED LED UNIT AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  THE UNIT IS SUBJECT TO WATER DAMAGE.  THE PRICE FOR THE PART ALONE IS OVER $800.    RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTED ON 1992 - 1997 VEHICLES, AND THEN AGAIN ON 1998 - 2001 CADILLAC VEHICLES WITH 100% FAILURE RATE, NO REPAIR IS POSSIBLE OTHER THAN REPLACING THE $800 PART.    THE CADILLAC DIVISION OF GM SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND REPLACE THESE DEFECTIVE UNITS. *TR",
