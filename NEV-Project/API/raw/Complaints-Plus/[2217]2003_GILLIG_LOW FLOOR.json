ANN ARBOR TRANSIT HAS FILED OVER FORTY WARRANTY CLAIMS WITHIN THE ONE YEAR PERIOD ONLY TO BE REJECTED. ANN ARBOR TRANSIT HAS SPOKEN TO GILLIG'S SERVICE MANAGER ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT WE ARE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS WITH THIS PROBLEM. GILLIG HAS SUPPLIED A NEW WIRING HARNESS TO CONSIDER, BUT THE NEW HARNESS WAS REJECTED BECAUSE IT WAS IDENTICAL TO THE EXISTING. GILLIG CLAIMS TO BE WILLING TO HELP, BUT DOES NOTHING. CURRENTLY, ALL 19 BUSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO THE VERY UNRELIABLE FRONT TURN SIGNAL  PERFORMANCE. ANN ARBOR TRANSIT OPERATES ABOUT 90 LARGE BUSES DAILY AND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SAFE, RELIABLE, CLEAN BUSES TO ALL OF OUR 4 MILLION YEARLY CUSTOMERS, PLEASE HELP!   *NM",
