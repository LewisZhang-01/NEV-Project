        "summary": "On March 25, 2022, I was driving my 2010 Toyota Prius, approx. 209,000 miles. When I had parked my vehicle, and turned my A/C on, my vehicle started to make this annoying beeping noise non-stop and all of the light on the dashboard had lit up. My brake lights, ABS, and the slip indicator all came on. When I went to drive my vehicle all of sudden my brakes did not respond. I had to force break and push down on the brakes very hard, to the point where I'm flooring the brakes. I checked with Toyota to see if there was a recall on my vehicle, and they told me that there were no recalls. When I did my research on 2010 Toyota Prius, I found that this is a common issue that the brake actuator and brake booster pumps are faulty on these vehicles. I did not receive a recall notice for this vehicle.   Currently, my vehicle is not drivable and not safe to drive. For this to happen out of nowhere with no warning is unacceptable.",

After looking in my rear view and seeing no one on me I realized something else happened. I look at my dash and check hybrid system light was on. I was in traffic at the light waiting and looked it up on my phone to find out what to do. Some article said to pull over and turn it off and restart it. The light turned green and traffic started moving so I started to drive. I thought I could probably make it home but the car started driving a lot slower than usual. I really didn\u2019t want to pull over because it was in a bad part of town but I felt like I had no choice because the car was barely moving. It seemed more dangerous to be on the road with other drivers. So I pulled over and parked and tried starting it again. It wouldn\u2019t shift to drive so now I\u2019m stuck and can\u2019t get home unless I pay to get my car towed. I get my car towed to the house. I put a meter on the battery and it was fine. I put a diagnostics tester on it and came up with these codes POA1A and POA94. I contacted hybrid mechanic that doesn\u2019t work at Toyota and he said to take it in to a dealership and sent me the ZE3 warranty letter and said they would fix it. I paid for it to be towed to the dealership. There were already a lot of cars waiting to be serviced when I got there. Anyway, they said they would fix it after they did their diagnostics after I paid $120 for it. That was 3/21/2022. I sent CSR the ZE3 letter and he said it wasn\u2019t covered. It\u2019s like he didn\u2019t even read it. A day later he said he needed to talk to a warranty administrator then a day later he said it would be covered but I don\u2019t qualify for a loaner but they can give me a rental for $45 a day. I friend let me borrow their car for a couple days. Now as of writing this it\u2019s midnight 3/30/2022. I still don\u2019t have my car and I\u2019m about to be without a car unless I buy one or rent one. No ETA on the part being delivered either. I\u2019m SOL.",

When applying foot pressure, you can hear the pump winding - this occurs while at rest as well as when trying to slow the car down. There are times when applying the brake that the floor pedal will lock and cause the car to skid while barely reducing the speed of the car. I have had multiple near accident incidences as a result and put myself and others at risk.  3. The car ferociously vibrates every morning - discovered that the head gasket has failed prematurely and due to the car overcompensating for the failing hybrid battery that is being impacted by the failing hybrid inverter.

Less than one minute later, the \"check hybrid system\" alert came on, with an exclamation mark inside of a yellow triangle symbol displayed. The vehicle instantly had no power when the accelerator was depressed.  The vehicle coasted to a stop and would not shift into drive.  The vehicle was towed to our home.  Upon delivering the vehicle to our home, the tow driver used an emergency battery jump start device and the vehicle was able to shift into drive and be driven into the garage.  The 12 volt battery was replaced the next day and the vehicle no longer exhibited any disfunction.  This was an unexpected event with no warning that the 12 volt battery was in need of replacement.  It could have resulted in a serious collision, if the freeway had been more congested, as the vehicle had been immediately driven 2 lanes over to the nearest exit, and came to a stop just after exiting, safely at the side of the road.  This is a very dangerous safety condition that should have had some type of alert that the simple 12 volt battery system was in danger of failing, causing a catastrophic failure of the engine and power train. Or, the car should simply not be able to drive, if the 12 volt battery is that low, to ensure passenger and community safety. Prime example: Toyota Prius has a warning alert that the key fob battery is low. The warning gives you a couple of weeks to replace the battery, and repeatedly displays the warning whenever you power up the vehicle.",

My odometer reading on oil change was 123,268. I drove 2806 miles, when I woke up on December 08, 2021 with no oil in my engine. I thought that was very strange so after adding a quart of oil My husband got for me. I took the vehicle back to the shop ( Good Year Tire & Rubber Company 1585- A Island Lane Fleming Island, FL 32003) I originally had my oil changed at, to have them check if there was some sort of leak. The odometer reading at that day/ service was 126,074. After a full inspection of the engine  exterior componence, no leak was to be found. Then  I decided to do some research only to find out that back in 2016 Toyota had a lawsuit against them for having manufacturer  defects in the productions of  engine between the years of 2006 - 2011. The manufacturer defect was the engine piston would eventually start having oil leaks into the engine causing engine excessive oil consumption. That same day I took my vehicle to the nearest Toyota dealership ( Coggin Toyota At the Avenues 11340 Philips Hwy Jacksonville FL32256) for a engine oil consumption test to be serviced on my vehicle. This process takes place by filling oil to the full line marking it... confirming there is no leaks....sealing everything and I was to return after driving 1200 miles ( odometer reading at service was 126,094). upon returning the vehicle on December 30, 2021...My vehicle failed the engine oil consumption test because after driving 1221 miles my engine was low on oil by 1.5 quart. This kind of engine oil consumption not only causes my engine to deuterate in time, but also  my vehicle diminishes in value. After it was established that my vehicle engine consumes oil / failed the engine oil consumption test. Toyota advised me to get a new engine that would cost me $6987.63  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

The car has 70,000 miles on it at this time, and we have owned the car for 10 years and 8 months. Toyota will not honor this Customer Support Program since we are 8 months beyond the expiration date.

They also become very soft and not responsive if the engine has not run since the last time the brakes were pushed. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE! ! !

The contact was able to restart and slowly drive the vehicle back to the residence. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic to be diagnosed. The contact was informed that the ABS pump needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 140,000.",

I end up paying for the repairs of my car, and  have the receipt to prove it.

This only happens during traffic stops that i\u2019m already pressing the brakes, but for some reason if i hit a pothole, like i mentioned above. That car accelerates, and thus cause me to almost hit the car in front of me. I was aware of this issue, so to compensate, i pressed the brake pedals harder whenever this incidents happen.",

Both representatives acknowledged that Toyota was aware of the brake booster failure from owners. Randall acknowledged that many owners have complained to Toyota about brake booster failure and that is it commonly reported to Toyota, hence Toyota issued a Toyota Customer Support Program Notification ZJB. However, I am told that coverage for my Prius under Notification ZJB has expired, that there is not a recall for the defective parts, and that Toyota will not assist with fixing this problem for my car. I believe this problem is a safety issue and that Toyota needs to issue a recall as soon as possible to remedy this known defect.",

I did some research and found that they extended the warranty on the brake booster and assembly pump. The thing is I had taken the car in because the abs, brakes, and traction control lights came on last year. They acted like they had no clue what was wrong and just unplugged the battery and hooked it back up to make sure the lights went off. The lights were off for less than a mile and when I called back they acted clueless and said for $200 out of pocket they can do more extensive testing but said they saw nothing wrong and that the car was driving normally. How does Toyota have a major problem that they extend the warranty and the Toyota dealership knows nothing about it and can\u2019t give me answers when I have the exact issues the extended warranty is supposed to cover? I could have been seriously injured and hurt someone else and Toyota doesn\u2019t care. Their representative told me that they had done enough and it was on me to fix the problem as now I was no longer covered under their extended warranty.

As soon as I opened my driver's door & exited, I turned to close the door & saw that my sunroof had basically exploded. It was jagged & missing pieces around 3 of 4 edges.  I was an hour from home & wanted to make sure I arrived safely. En route I heard chunks falling off & by the time I got home the middle portion had rippled & gaping holes were visible.",

I was driving home on I-80 and when I was getting down on the slope of the Sacramento river bridge, three lights suddenly popped on the dashboard - ABS light, Brake light and Traction control light. Following this, I lost efficient control on the brakes and I had to push really hard on the brake pad to even slow the car down. If I had to stop suddenly, it would have definitely resulted in a serious crash. Because the brakes stopped working as they are supposed to, I turned on the blinkers, took the exit and tried to stop slowly. I was able to stop on the side of the road just before the red signal. I was just couple of miles from my home so I kept the blinkers on, and slowly drove through internal roads to my home. Later when I found out the code, it came as C1391 which is usually for failure of the brake booster assembly or the brake booster pump assembly or both. When I contacted my local Toyota dealership, they mentioned that the extended warranty for replacing these parts ended in November 2020 and because of that they asked me to take care of this >$3000 repair. I also contacted Toyota corporate to file a complaint and was told the same thing.  This issue is a serious safety concern and Toyota should issue a recall and not an extended warranty. They should not be waiting for people to loose their lives before they issue a recall.",

Being that my car is past the 10 year warranty and past the extension for mileage, I had to pay out of pocket. This repair was done and upon receiving my car back, the gas mileage instantly began to drop.  It went from averaging 42-48MPG in my town to 25-30MPG. I took it in the be looked at and they ensured me nothing was wrong with the car AT ALL. The battery wasn\u2019t holding charge on top of this and it wasn\u2019t reading the same on the dash about the 0-100 current gas mileage you\u2019re getting as you go (the lines scale thing) that goes up when you let off the gas, and I could feel a strange shift while I was driving so I took it in again.

I SPOKE WITH MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS, AND AFTER EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS, I WAS INFORMED (SEVERAL TIMES AS I WAS REPEATEDLY TRANSFERRED) THAT I HAD TO PAY AN INSPECTION FEE THAT ALSO CHANGED WITH EACH PERSON.

ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2020 WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT ROUGHLY 40 MPH, I EXPERIENCED INDICATION LIGHTS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS OUTLINED IN THE SAFETY RECALL AND TOYOTA SUPPORT PROGRAM.

THE TOYOTA CSP ZJB DOES NOT COVER MY VEHICLE DUE TO TIME AND MILEAGE OF THE VEHICLE, BUT I FEEL THIS SAFETY CRITICAL SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED PRIOR TO ME EXPERIENCING A FAILURE. TOYOTA SELECTIVELY ONLY REPLACED BRAKE BOOSTER ASSEMBLIES OUTLINED IN THE RECALL AND THE CSP, IF THE AUTOMOBILE WAS EXPERIENCE ISSUES. TOYOTA STOPPED SHORT OF PREVENTATIVE SAFETY MEASURES OF REPLACING THIS ASSEMBLY PRIOR TO FAILURE, LEADING TO AN ALMOST COLLISION EVENT FOR ME.

I STOPPED THE CAR--THE SHRIEKING AND GRINDING CONTINUED.  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR--THE SHRIEKING AND GRINDING SLOWED AFTER A FEW MINUTES.  WHEN I TURNED THE CAR ON AGAIN, THE SHRIEKING AND GRINDING STARTED AND THE CAR WAS BEEPING IN A WAY I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABOUT 4 BLOCKS FROM MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  I ASKED THEM IF I WAS SAFE TO DRIVE THE FOUR BLOCKS OR IF I SHOULD GET THE CAR TOWED, AND THEY SAID I SHOULD BE SAFE TO DRIVE.  I DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE CAR SHRIEKING AND BEEPING.  THE BRAKES FELT SQUISHY AND UNRELIABLE, BUT THE DEALERSHIP HAS SAID I SHOULD BE FINE.  I DROPPED OFF THE CAR.      THE NEXT DAY, I GOT A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP SAYING THAT MY BRAKE BOOSTER PUMP AND BRAKE CYLINDER ASSEMBLY HAD TOTALLY FAILED.

MY CAR WAS UNDER 150,000 MILES, AS REQUIRED BY THE WARRANTY, AND DISPLAYED THE CORRECT FAILURE CODE AS REQUIRED BY THE WARRANTY. BUT, SINCE MY CAR DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM OR DISPLAY AN ERROR CODE BEFORE THE END OF FEBRUARY 2020, I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS INELIGIBLE. I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OVER $4100 FOR A REPAIR THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP, BUY A NEW CAR OR TAKE MY CHANCES AND DRIVE THE CAR 'AS IS' UNTIL I COULD FIND A CHEAPER SOLUTION. THE CHEAPER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO FIND ANOTHER ABS UNIT AT A SALVAGE YARD, AND HAVE A NON-TOYOTA CERTIFIED MECHANIC INSTALL IT. THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE A SALVAGE YARD UNIT WILL NOT SIMPLY FAIL AGAIN. I WAS WELL WITHIN THE 150,000 MILE LIMIT OF THE WARRANTY.

I WAS QUOTED A COST OF APPROX. $1500 TO OPEN IT UP, FIX THE LEAK, & CHECK FOR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS.

I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY THE TOTAL COST OF THE SERVICE BUT HAD NO CHOICE AND PROCEED TO GET IT REPAIRED.

CODE # C1391; THEY RECOMMEND  REPLACING THE MASTER CYLINDER; AND BOOSTER PUMP ASSEMBLY SAYING THERE IS AN ABNORMAL LEAK DOWN OF THE BRAKE ACCUMULATOR. THIS IS INSANE. I CANNOT AFFORD  TO FIX IT AND MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TO LIVE; THEREFORE DRIVING  ABOUT 200 MILES/DAY WITH HYDRAULIC ONLY BRAKES. MY RESEARCH INDICATES THERE WAS A MAJOR RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM ON THE 2010 MODEL. THE DEALERSHIP AND TOYOTA CORPORATE  BOTH SAY MY VEHICLE WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.  I FEEL AS THOUGH IT SHOULD BE SINCE, OBVIOUSLY, THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED. I AM NOT ALONE, AS MANY  OWNERS ON PRIUSCHAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN  TO NOT ONLY MYSELF, OTHER VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS, BUT ALSO MY PASSENGERS.  AN EXPANDED RECALL IS NECESSARY AND WARRANTED. ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WILL HELP AND MAKE US ALL SAFER.  .",

IN ORDER FOR THE BRAKES TO WORK, HE HAD TO PRESS VERY HARD ON THEM AND ALSO ALLOW MUCH MORE DISTANCE FOR THE CAR TO STOP. HE COULD HAVE EASILY CRASHED INTO THE BACK OF ANOTHER VEHICLE. HE TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND WAS INFORMED THE BRAKE BOOSTER ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS THE SAME COMPLAINT AS A 2010 PRIUS RECALL, BUT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, SO I DID NOT RECEIVE A NOTICE IN THE AIL. ALSO, WE HAD TO PAY $3008 TO HAVE THE BRAKE BOOSTER ASSEMBLY REPLACED.   THE CONSUMER REFERENCED RECALL # 13V235000. UPDATED 02/11/16. *JB",

THE CAR WAS OFF AT THE TIME AND THE KEY WAS NOT IN THE CAR AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.  WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING, THE CAR EVIDENTLY CAUGHT FIRE SPONTANEOUSLY AT APPROXIMATELY 2 A.M. WHILE IT WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE.  THE GARAGE DOOR WAS CLOSED.  BY THE TIME WE WOKE UP, THE GARAGE WAS FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES.   WE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE FIRE.   HOWEVER, OUR HOUSE WAS TOO SEVERELY DAMAGED (FIRE, SMOKE AND WATER) AFTER THE FIRE TO BE LIVABLE, AND IT IS CURRENTLY BEING REBUILT.  OUR FAMILY OF FOUR (HUSBAND, WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN, 15 AND ALMOST 11 YEARS OLD)  IS CURRENTLY LIVING IN A RENTAL HOUSE. WE LOST ALL THREE OF OUR CARS (THE OTHER CARS WERE A DODGE DURANGO AND A HONDA ACCORD) AND A MAJORITY OF OUR POSSESSIONS.   DAMAGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LIKELY IN EXCESS OF $500,000 INCLUDING HOUSE, CARS, DAMAGE TO LANDSCAPING, PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURNITURE, CLOTHING, ETC.

I SHOULD NOT BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS AND REPAIRS OF A KNOWN SAFETY PROBLEM WHICH HAD A RECALL. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT THE DEALERS' FAULT AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE HELD FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE EITHER.  *TR",

FINALLY, THIS YEAR, WE NEARLY GOT INTO TWO SEPARATE ACCIDENTS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN LURCHING FORWARD.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF VICTORY TOYOTA, AND WAS TOLD BLUNTLY THAT THERE WAS NEVER A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE, THAT, UNLESS I COULD RECREATE THE PROBLEM WITH A TECHNICIAN IN THE CAR, I WAS MAKING THINGS UP.  THAT IS WHAT LEAD TO THIS COMPLAINT.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THE CAR HAD INDEED BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS BRAKE ISSUE WITH RECALL ID # 68066.  SO THEY LIED ABOUT THE RECALL HISTORY FOR MY CAR.  ALSO, RECREATING SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AT RANDOM DURING A FINITE TIME PERIOD, SUCH AS A TEST DRIVE, IS IMPROBABLE, AND TO MAKE SERVICING THE CAR CONTINGENT ON THAT TEST DRIVE IS LUDICROUS.  I AM HOPING THAT, BY LODGING THIS COMPLAINT SOMETHING WILL GET DONE BEFORE MY WIFE, ME, OR/AND SOMEONE ELSE IS/ARE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

YOUR WEBSITE SAYS YOU HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT 33 COMPLAINS.  UNLESS I MISSED SOMETHING, IS THERE ANY STATUS REPORT FROM TOYOTA OR THE RECALL THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM?   ALSO, I LIVE IN THE EAST COAST, SPECIFICALLY IN NJ. WE HAD A BRUTAL WINTER THIS YEAR. IN ONE INCIDENT, I WAS DRIVING UP A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED ROAD (BARELY 2--5% INCLINE) IN A 25MPH RESIDENTIAL ROAD WITH SLIGHTLY SLIPPERY ROAD (NOT REALLY BLACK ICE PER SE). I LOSS CONTROL AND TRACTION CONTROL LITE UP AND STARTED BEEPING. WHILE TRYING TO BRING THE CAR IN CONTROL, MY CAR ENDED UP ON THE OTHER SIDE (THANKFULLY THERE WERE NO VEHICLES PARKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OR ANY ONCOMING VEHICLES) AND THEN SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT BUT FINALLY MANAGED TO BRING IT BACK IN CONTROL.

BASED UPON 2+ YEARS OF ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, I WOULD NOTE THAT: (1) THIS ANOMALY OCCURS CONSISTENTLY, AND IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED OR ATTENUATED, (2) I BELIEVE THAT STOPPING DISTANCES ARE LONGER THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED WITHOUT THIS ANOMALY, (3) MY PRIUS WAS MANUFACTURED AFTER THE 2010 SOFTWARE FIX, AND (4) OTHER DRIVERS OF 2010 AND LATER PRIUS CARS HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PHENOMENON WHEN I ASKED ABOUT IT (SEE BELOW).    MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WOULD NOTE THE FOLLOWING SOURCE OF EVIDENCE WHICH YOU MIGHT EASILY PURSUE FURTHER.     I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC) FOR MOST OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE NYC TAXI FLEET INCLUDES A SIZABLE NUMBER OF TOYOTA PRIUS CARS. EVERY TIME I TAKE A PRIUS TAXI, I ASK THE DRIVER IF HE HAS ENCOUNTERED A SIMILAR PROBLEM WHEN BRAKING ON ROUGH SURFACES. IN MORE THAN A DOZEN SUCH INSTANCES, DRIVERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY REPORTED THIS SAME PROBLEM.    WHILE YOU MAY NOT WANT TO TRUST MY EVIDENCE ON THIS MATTER, IT WOULD BE VERY CHEAP FOR NHTSA TO SEND AN INVESTIGATOR TO SOME OF THE LARGE TAXI GARAGES IN NYC TO INTERVIEW DRIVERS WITH EXPERIENCE DRIVING PRIUS TAXI CABS. GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF MILES LOGGED BY TAXI DRIVERS, THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FROM HIGHLY EXPERIENCED DRIVERS --- WHO MUST REGULARLY CONTEND WITH NYC'S MYRIAD POTHOLES.     I WOULD FINALLY NOTE THAT --- OTHER THAN THIS ANOMALY --- I LOVE MY PRIUS. IT IS A GREAT CAR. I WOULD JUST LIKE FOR TOYOTA TO FIGURE OUR WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ANOMALY AND FIX IT.  *TR",

IN THE TWO YEARS I HAVE OWNED MY TOYOTA PRIUS, I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT HITS THE PARKING LOT SEPARATIONS BECAUSE IT IS LOW.  I MUST STOP BEFORE THE PARKING LOT SEPARATION IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS.  IT IS STRANGE THAT THE TOYOTA WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE SO LOW AS TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM.  EVEN MORE ALARMING IS THAT MY BUMPER BOTTOM SUDDENLY FELL OFF, WITHOUT WARNING.

I WAS ABLE TO STEER IT TO A PARKING LOT NEARBY BY USING THE FOOT BRAKE. PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, I HEARD SQUEAKING NOISES FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS WHENEVER I STEP ON THE BRAKES. I WAS RELIEVED THAT I DID NOT GET INTO AN ACCIDENT.     ACTION AFTER THE 1ST INCIDENT:  APRIL 24, 2010.  WE TOWED THE CAR TO DCH TOYOTA FREEHOLD, AND IT TOOK ABOUT 5 DAYS TO REPAIR THE BRAKES SO THEY GAVE US A LOANER CAR WHICH WE TRULY APPRECIATE. BUT WHEN WE PICKED UP THE CAR, THE BRAKES WERE FIXED BUT THE SQUEAKING NOISE IS STILL PRESENT, AND OUR WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED.  WE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP RIGHT AWAY TO INFORM THEM ABOUT THE SQUEAKING NOISE AND TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CRACKED WINDSHIELD.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT THEIR TECHNICIANS TESTED MY CAR AND DEEMED IT SAFE TO DRIVE AND THAT THEY WOULD NEVER RELEASE MY CAR UNLESS THEY KNOW IT IS SAFE TO BE ON THE ROAD.     SECOND INCIDENT:  APRIL 29, 2013, I LOST THE BRAKES AGAIN WHILE I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK AROUND 7:00 PM. I REALLY GOT VERY SCARED BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TRAFFIC AT THAT TIME. I WAS ABLE TO STOP AND PARK MY CAR SLOWLY TO THE CURB WITHOUT HITTING ANYBODY ELSE BY USING THE FOOT BREAK.    ACTION AFTER THE SECOND INCIDENT:  SAME NIGHT, WE TOWED THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR, AND AFTER A WEEK OF WAITING, THEY FINALLY CAME BACK TO US SPECIFYING THAT THE WHOLE MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE PAD ASSEMBLY IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND WILL COST MORE THAN 4K FOR PARTS ALONE.

I FELT COMPELLED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AFTER HAVING THIS HAPPEN TWICE IN THE PAST WEEK, IN THE HOPES THAT SOME PERMANENT FIX CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE, AND TO WARN PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TO BE CAUTIOUS.  IN ALL INCIDENTS,  WHEN TRAVELING OVER BUMPS IN A ROAD WITH THE BRAKES ENGAGED, THERE IS A SUDDEN SLIGHT \"ACCELERATION\", BUT IN ACTUALITY, PROBABLY JUST THE MOMENTARY LOSS OF BRAKING. THIS HAPPENS WHEN GOING OVER:  (1) MANHOLE COVERS (2) POTHOLES (3) SLIGHT DIPS IN THE ROAD (FROM SUBSIDING ROAD PATCHING AREAS).  DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE WORSE IN WET CONDITIONS, AND HAS ONLY HAPPENED TO ME AT LOW SPEEDS (~5 -- ~ 20 MPH).  NOTE THAT ORIGINAL CARPETED MATS WERE REPLACED WITH ONES THAT FIT A BIT BETTER, AND DO NOT CAUSE ANY ISSUES WITH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL.  ONCE THE BUMP IS PASSED OVER, NORMAL BRAKING OCCURS. WHEN I FEEL THIS VEHICLE MOMENTARILY LOSE BRAKING, I QUICKLY LET OFF THE BRAKE FOR A SPLIT SECOND, AND RESUME BRAKING.  I HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THIS DEFECT, BUT I SURE WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROVIDE A QUALITY RECALL FIX.

THE ROAD HAS A MANHOLE COVER RECESSED ABOUT 1 INCH INTO THE ROAD ALONG THE PATH OF MY PASSENGER SIDE TIRES.  EVERY TIME I DRIVE OVER THIS MANHOLE COVER THE PRIUS COMPLETELY LOSES ABILITY TO BRAKE FOR ABOUT 1/2 SECOND, THEN BRAKING IS REESTABLISHED.  THERE ARE OTHER SMALL BUMPS I DRIVE OVER AT OTHER PLACES WHICH HAVE THE SAME RESULTS TO THE PRIUS BRAKING SYSTEM.  YESTERDAY (26 OCT 2011) SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING OVER A BUMP.  THIS TIME I WAS ACCELERATING AFTER HAVING MADE A RIGHT TURN FROM A COMPLETE STOP.  WHILE STILL ACCELERATING AFTER THE TURN I SIGNALED LEFT AND PROCEEDED TO MERGE INTO THE LEFT HAND LANE. AS THE PRIUS RIGHT FRONT TIRE DROVE OVER THE REFLECTIVE LANE MARKER IMBEDDED IN THE ROAD SURFACE (THE MARKER STICKS OUT ABOUT 1/2 INCH FROM ROAD SURFACE)  THE PRIUS WENT OUT OF CONTROL.  THE CAR SUDDENLY AND SEVERELY PULLED HARD TO THE LEFT AND RAPIDLY SLOWED, I STRUGGLED AGAINST THE CARS ACTIONS TO AVOID HITTING THE RAISED CENTER MEDIAN.  MY FIRST THOUGH WAS THAT I MUST HAVE HAD A COMPLETE AND INSTANTANEOUS BLOW OUT ON THE FRONT LEFT TIRE.  MY REACTION WAS TO IMMEDIATELY REMOVE MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR.  THEN AS I WAS FURTHER ASSESSING MY OPTIONS AND THE SURROUNDING TRAFFIC THE PRIUS REGAINED CONTROL AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AS IF NOTHING HAD EVER HAPPENED.  AS THE PRIUS REINSTATED CONTROL I HEARD A BEEP COME FROM THE DASHBOARD, HOWEVER I WAS NOT QUICK ENOUGH TO NOTICE IF ANY WARNING LIGHTS HAD ENGAGED DURING THE INCIDENT.

I HAVE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM WITH A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT UNTIL A RECALL/SOLUTION IS ISSUED THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO. THEY TOLD ME TO BRAKE HARDER WHEN DRIVING OVER POTHOLES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE PROBLEM; THE BRAKES, HOWEVER, DO NOT FAIL WITH EVERY POTHOLE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE POTHOLES HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN SIZE, YET FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT, IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE SIZE OF THE POTHOLE AND THUS IF THE CAR WILL LOSE BRAKING POWER. SO, SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES FOR EVERY POTHOLE IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS NOT SINCE STOPPING TOO QUICKLY CAN CAUSE A REAR-END ACCIDENT. I LIVE IN A CITY OVERWHELMED WITH HILLS AND POTHOLES SO THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS NEARLY EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR. IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I AM FEARFUL TO DRIVE MY CAR SINCE I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS AND KNOW THAT UNLESS THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED, IT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. BRIEFLY LOSING BRAKING POWER MAY SEEM INSIGNIFICANT BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DRIVEN THE CAR AND EXPERIENCED THE LACK OF CONTROL THE ONLY COMPARISON THAT I CAN MAKE IS DRIVING ON ICE. YOU FEEL UTTERLY HELPLESS FOR THE TIME THAT THE CAR IS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL, EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A FEW SECONDS, DURING WHICH TIME YOU ARE LEGALLY AND MORALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT YOUR CAR DOES OR HITS. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER ROAD HAZARDS AND SAFETY CONCERNS, WHETHER OR NOT MY CAR IS GOING TO STOP WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF THEM. I IMPLORE YOU, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM AND REQUIRE THAT TOYOTA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIXING IT AND ENSURING THE SAFETY OF PRIUS OWNERS, PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER DRIVERS. THANK YOU.",

THE PRESENCE OF RODENTS IN THE ENGINE AREA IS OF COURSE UNAVODIABLE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HEAR ABOUT THE CAR DESIGN ALLOW MICE TO EASILY MOVE INTO THE CABIN. THIS OBVIOUSLY HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES: I ALREADY HAVE TO REPLACE THE AIR FILTER AND THE PADDING BEHIND THE GLOVES COMPARTMENT AND I AM NOT SURE IF ANY OTHER PARTS HAVE BEEN CHEWED AWAY.   MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS CERTAINLY A HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN. I HAVE TO GET THE CAR DETAILED AND THE AIR SYSTEM FLUSHED TO AVOID TOXIC CONTAMINATION FROM MOUSE EXCREMENTS, AND THIS ENDANGERS ME EVERY TIME I DRIVE: A MOUSE CRAWLING IN THE CABIN OF THE CAR WHILE I AM DRIVING IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE! IT APPEARS THAT THE PLACING OF SCREENS IN AS FEW AS 4 PARTS OF THE AIR SYSTEM WOULD STOP THE MOUSE ACCESS TO THE CABIN, BUT TOYOTA, BOTH MY LOCAL DEALER AND THE NATIONAL SERVICE CENTER, CLAIM THERE IS NOTHING THE CAN OR WILL DO, AND THAT, DESPITE THE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, THIS IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE IN ALL CARS.   MANY PEOPLE HAVE POSTED ONLINE ABOUT MICE AND RODENTS IN THEIR PRIUS CARS.

WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED WITH A CONSISTENT PRESSURE, THE CAR \"FEELS\" AS IF THE BRAKES DISENGAGE UPON ENTERING A ROUGH PATCH OF ROAD.  THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME.

THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE TWO ENDS OF THE HARNESS WERE MANUFACTURED BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT USED DIFFERENT PLASTIC.THE PLASTIC IN THE CONNECTORS WOULD REACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND PRODUCE A GAS.

I WAS PRESSING ON THE HORN AND SHE DIDN'T HEAR. THE IMPACT MUST HAVE FREED SOME STUCK COMPONENT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE 2 HOURS LATER WHEN THE TOW TRUCK FINALLY CAME, THE CAR WORKED AGAIN; NO WARNING LIGHTS ETC.

THE BRAKES ARE TEMPORARILY DISABLED AND THE VEHICLE UNEXPECTEDLY ACCELERATES AS A RESULT OF ITS MOMENTUM PRIOR TO INITIALIZING THE BRAKES.  THE FAILURE OCCURS WHEN THE VEHICLE PASSES OVER A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE TEXTURE/FRICTION OF THE ROAD SURFACE.   I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE FAILURE DOZENS OF TIMES, WHEN DRIVING OVER METAL SURFACES (MANHOLE COVERS, POTHOLE COVERS, TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION COVERS, METAL EXPANSION INSERTS IN BRIDGES, ETC), AS WELL AS SMALL PATCHES OF CONDENSATION (SUCH AS SMALL PUDDLES UNDER A BRIDGE WHEN THE SURROUNDING ROAD IS DRY). THE FAILURE IS NOT RELATED TO HYDROPLANING, AND HAS OCCURRED AT SPEEDS AS LOW AS 15 MPH.  THE FAILURE CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO ACCELERATE UNTIL A FEW SECONDS AFTER IT HAS PASSED OVER THE SLICK SURFACE.   AFTER RETURNING TO THE REGULAR ROAD SURFACE, THE BRAKES SLOWLY REGAIN TRACTION AND RESUME THEIR FUNCTION OF SLOWING THE VEHICLE DOWN.

HOWEVER, SINCE THE SOFTWARE UPDATE, IN THE FIRST WEEK ALONE, THE INCONSISTENT FEEL OCCURRED SEVEN TIMES, WITH THE MOST ALARMING INCIDENT OCCURRING DURING MY MORNING DRIVE TO WORK ON FRIDAY, MARCH 5TH.  I WAS DRIVING ON PICO BOULEVARD JUST PAST AVENUE OF THE STARS, GENTLY TAPPING ON MY BRAKES DOWN THE HILL FOR A STOP, WHEN THE CAR BRIEFLY ACCELERATED AND ALMOST REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  ADDITIONALLY, I EXPERIENCED THE BRIEF ACCELERATION TWICE WHILE BRAKING FOR PEDESTRIANS AT CROSSWALKS LAST WEEK.  NOW, I AM EXPERIENCING THE SLIPPING SENSATION WITH THE BRAKES ABOUT 2 - 3 TIMES PER WEEK.    I HAVE CALLING TOYOTA TOLL-FREE CUSTOMER SERVICE NINETEEN TIMES, BUT EACH TIME RECEIVED AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE STATING THAT THE COMPANY WAS EXPERIENCING HIGH CALL VOLUME AND WOULD BE UNABLE TO ANSWER MY CALL.  I SENT TWO FAXES ON MARCH 6TH, ASKING THE COMPANY TO ARRANGE A SECOND SERVICE APPOINTMENT TO REPAIR THE BRAKES.  I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY.      TODAY, ON MARCH 20TH, I CALLED TOYOTA SANTA MONICA TO DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM AND REQUEST A SECOND SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  WHILE DRIVING DURING MY LUNCH BREAK TODAY, I AGAIN HAD THE BRAKES SLIP ON ME.  I SPOKE WITH A SERVICE SUPERVISOR AT TOYOTA SANTA MONICA AT 500 PM TODAY TO ASK FOR A SECOND APPOINTMENT.  HE DECIDED TO INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE AND TELL ME THAT WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING IS A NORMAL FEEL OF THE ABS BRAKES.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  I WANT THE CAR REPAIRED.  IF TOYOTA CANNOT PREVENT THIS INCONSISTENT FEEL AND SLIPPING SENSATION IN MY BRAKES, THEN I WAS MY PURCHASE CONTRACT TO BE COMPLETELY DISSOLVED.

WHEN USING CRUISE CONTROL:  ~  THERE'S REGULARLY WHAT FEELS LIKE AN ENGINE SURGE WHEN THE FOOT BRAKE IS APPLIED TO TURN OFF CRUISE CONTROL.  THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY, INCLUDING ON SMOOTH, LEVEL, DRY ROADWAYS AND FREEWAYS AND AT SPEED SETTINGS FROM 45 TO 60 MPH.  BECAUSE OF CONCERN ABOUT THIS I NOW MANUALLY TURN OFF CRUISE CONTROL.  THREE DAYS AGO THE CAR WAS TEST DRIVEN BY A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE, WHO REPORTED USING CRUISE CONTROL 6 TIMES AND TURNING CRUISE CONTROL OFF BY APPLYING THE FOOT BRAKE; THE REPORT WAS 'CRUISE CONTROL SHUT OFF IMMEDIATELY WHEN ENOUGH PRESSURE APPLIED [EMPHASIS ADDED] TO PEDAL.'      ~  ON SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2010 AFTER THE CAR HAD BEEN SET AT 60 IN CRUISE CONTROL FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR (LIKE A CAR BEING DRIVEN WITH THE \"HAND\" BRAKE ON, BUT MY CAR'S WASN'T ENGAGED) WHILE ON A DRY FREEWAY DOWNGRADE (GRADUAL, NOT STEEP).   I TURNED OFF THE CRUISE CONTROL, CONTINUED AT THE SAME SPEED AND THE ODOR STOPPED.  THIS WAS THE FIRST SUCH OCCURRENCE.  I'VE USED CRUISE CONTROL REGULARLY BECAUSE OF USUALLY DRIVING ON FREEWAYS 6 DAYS/WEEK.  THE TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT'S TEST DRIVE THREE DAYS AGO REPORTED 'NOT EVIDENT.'     2.  SHIFTING FROM PARK TO DRIVE  SEVERAL TIMES THIS SHIFTING WAS SUCCESSFUL ONLY AFTER MULTIPLE TRIES.  ON ONE RECENT OCCASION AFTER SEVERAL TRIES AND ALSO TURNING THE CAR OFF, ON AGAIN, AND THEN UNSUCCESSFULLY RETRYING, I RESORTED TO USING THE SAFETY CONNECT SOS BUTTON.  THERE WERE NO DOORS AJAR AND NO INDICATION OF THE CAUSE.

I WAS TOLD THAT A CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER WOULD CALL ME BACK BY TUESDAY 3/2.  DID NOT HEAR BACK.  ON WEDNESDAY 3/3 I CALLED TO FOLLOW UP.  AFTER BEING ON HOLD FOR 1 HOUR, I GAVE UP.  SENT AN E-MAIL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVISING OF THE SITUATION.  STILL DID NOT HEAR BACK.  ON SATURDAY 3/6 I CALLED AGAIN.  WAS AGAIN ON HOLD X 1 HOUR AND TOLD CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT HAPPENED - THEY APOLOGIZED AND SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE MY CONTACT INFORMATION.  WAS TOLD I WOULD GET A CALL BACK BY 3/9.      DID FINALLY SPEAK WITH AN AGENT ON 3/8 WHO NOW TELLS ME THAT I WILL GET A CALL WITHIN 10 DAYS.  AT THAT TIME, I WILL BE OFFERED AN INSPECTION APPOINTMENT WITHIN THE FOLLOWING 30 DAYS.

I TOLD HER ABOUT THE CRUISE CONTROL DANGER, WHERE THE CAR HAD BEEN GOING ALONG NICELY ON CRUISE, BUT SUDDENLY RAPIDLY ACCELERATED WHEN, ON AUGUST 11, 2009, I WAS ON THE TRIP BETWEEN NEW JERSEY AND ILLINOIS COMING THROUGH THE TENNESSEE/KENTUCKY AREA.  I HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT ABOUT 65MPH ON CRUISE AND IT RAPIDLY ACCELERATED TO OVER 80MPH AND I PANICKED WHILE TRYING TO GET IT TO SLOW DOWN. I TRIED SLOWING IT DOWN USING THE CRUISE BUTTON, THEN DEPRESSED THE CRUISE OFF BUTTON. DIDN'T WORK. IT DID NOT RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO THE BRAKE UNTIL I BRAKED REALLY HARD. THEREFORE, MY DRIVING IT WAS SEVERELY LIMITED TO DRIVING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS IN TOWN. OTHER UNINTENDED ACCELERATION HAS OCCURRED EVEN WHEN NOT USING THE CRUISE. THE CAR BOLTED FORWARD NUMEROUS TIMES ON A BUMPY SECTION OF ROAD ON MY ROUTE HOME FROM WORK; IT HAPPENED OFTEN ENOUGH THERE THAT I COMPENSATED BY TAKING A DIFFERENT ROUTE. EFFORTS TO STOP THE FORWARD LUNGE INCLUDED BRAKING WITH NO RESPONSE, USING THE KNOB TO SHIFT TO A DIFFERENT SETTING, AND SCRAMBLING TO FIND THE [XXX] BUTTON TO PRESS PARK.  SOMETHING FINALLY STOPPED IT, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE NEXT SCARE OCCURRED AFTER IT SNOWED. I DROVE SLOWLY ON THE PLOWED ROAD, BUT WHEN THE CAR ENCOUNTERED SNOWY LUMPS IT RAPIDLY ACCELERATED LUNGING FORWARD AGAIN. MY ATTEMPTS TO STOP CAUSED ME TO SKID DANGEROUSLY INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE. I PARKED THE CAR IN THE GARAGE AND HAVE NOT DRIVEN IT AGAIN IN WELL OVER A MONTH DUE TO THE DANGER.  IN FEBRUARY, MY CO-WORKER[XXX] URGED ME NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD ABOUT A RECALL AND WAS AFRAID FOR ME, BUT I HAD ALREADY PARKED IT BY THEN ' KNOWING SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH IT.

MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON A SLIPPERY ROAD, IT WAS LIGHTLY SNOWING, AT ABOUT 10-15 MPH AND CAME TO A STOP SIGN. SHE APPLIED THE BRAKES AND SAID NOTHING HAPPENED. AS A CAR WAS AT THE STOP SIGN SHE TURNED TO AVOID THE CAR AND HIT A RAISED AND SHARP CURB, WHICH PIERCED THE TIRE AND BENT THE TIE-ROD. OUR CAR WAS TOWED TO A BODY SHOP. AFTER ABOUT 10 DAYS, STATE FARM INSPECTED THE CAR, BUT BY THIS TIME THE RECALL FOR THE PRIUS HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED. THE BODY SHOP THEN REFUSED TO FIX THE CAR AND WE HAD TO TAKE IT TO A TOYOTA DEALER. STATE FARM HAS SINCE DECIDED NOT PURSUE THIS INCIDENT AS THEY FEEL THE SNOW CAUSED THE ACCIDENT AND THAT THE TEMPORARY LOSS OF BRAKES IS NOT WHAT THE RECALL IS ABOUT.    FROM OUR READING OF NUMEROUS ARTICLES (NY TIMES) AND THE RECALL INFORMATION ITSELF, PLUS WHAT HAPPENED, WE ARE STRONGLY STATING THAT THERE WAS IN FACT A TEMPORARY OR MOMENTARY LOSS OF THE BRAKES WHICH DIRECTLY CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT. FROM OUR READING OF THE RECALL AND OTHER COMPLAINTS, SLIPPERY CONDITIONS ARE ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH CAUSE THIS PROBLEM.  IN OUR CASE, THIS PROBLEM WAS EXACERBATED AS NOT ONLY WAS THERE SLIPPERY CONDITIONS, BUT THE CAR WAS ON A HILL AS WELL. WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THIS ACCIDENT A SKIPPING OR MOMENTARY BRAKE PROBLEM WHEN GOING OVER BUMPY ROADS. WHEN ASKING ABOUT THIS WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD IT HAD TO DO WITH THE ABS SYSTEM AND THAT IT WAS NORMAL. WELL THE RECALL PROVES THIS WAS NOT NORMAL AND NOW WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM ON SLICK ROADS AS WELL -- WHICH HAS NOW COST US MONEY. *TR",

WITH A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POWER SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE BACK WHEELS.  NOW I AM ASSUMING IT IS SOME KIND OF CONNECTION TO THE ABS SYSTEM.  THIS HAPPENS MOST NOTABLY AT LOWER SPEEDS, ROUNDING A CORNER.  BUT I THINK IT MAY ALSO BE HAPPENING ON THE HIGHWAY, BUT THE SURGE IS HARDER TO DETECT AT HIGHER SPEED. *TR",

EVENTUALLY THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGED AND THE CAR CAME TO A STOP, BUT ONLY AFTER STRIKING THE DEER WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THE  CAR SUSTAINED $2500 WORTH OF FRONT END DAMAGE. LIGHTS, THE BUMPER AND FRONT PANELS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. POLICE AND INSURANCE REPORTS WERE FILED.

I QUESTIONED MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN I AM BRAKING OVER METAL (MANHOLE COVER, REPAIR LIDS, ETC.) THE CAR IS QUICKLY  PUSHED FORWARD ABOUT 3 TO 4 FEET. SEVERAL OTHER NEW OWNERS SAID THEY HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE. THE DEALER SAID THAT WHEN THEY CHECKED WITH TOYOTA, THEY WERE TOLD THAT THE HYBRID BATTERY MOTOR USED A MAGNET AND THE BRAKING SYSTEM TO RECHARGE IT. AND THAT THE PUSH FORWARD WAS FROM THE REPELLING ACTION OF THE MAGNET.  MY SISTERS OWN A 2008 CAMRY HYBRID AND 2008 PRIUS, AND THEY BOTH HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROPELLING MOTION WHEN ON METAL SURFACES ALSO. THE PROBLEM WITH THE DEALERS ADVICE TO \"NOT BRAKE ON METAL SURFACES\" DOESN'T HELP IN SNOW OR WATER SITUATIONS.  WILL THIS PROBLEM BE FIXED BY THE ABS BRAKES SOFTWARE CHANGE??    I ALSO HAD SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD SUDDENLY GO TO THE FLOOR AND PRODUCE VERY LITTLE BRAKING POWER. THE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT AND THE  DEALER SAID THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK WELL AND I ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. SO I NOW DRIVE WITH A LOT OF DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND OTHER CARS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. I SHOULD SAY THAT I'VE HAD OTHER CARS WITH ABS BRAKES AND THIS CAR DOES NOT FEEL LIKE I HAVE THEM. ON SLIPPERY SURFACES (SNOW, WATER) THE BRAKES DO NOT PUMP THEMSELVES LIKE OTHER ABS CARS THAT I HAVE DRIVEN. I HAVE DROPPED IT INTO LOW GEAR TO HELP BRAKE.

I CALLED MY DEALER A WEEK AGO TO REPORT THAT I TOO HAD EXPERIENCED THE BRAKING ISSUE THAT WAS REPORTED ON THE NEWS.  I WAS NOT SURE IF THE CAR WAS SKIDDING THE FIRST TIME I EXPERIENCED IT, I WAS GOING SLOWLY AND BRAKED OVER A SLIPPERY PATCH AND THE CAR LURCHED BEFORE BRAKING, BUT THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN OVER A ROUGH SURFACE.  WHEN I REPORTED THIS TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF MY DEALER, CONICELLI TOYOTA OF SPRINGFIELD, PA, I WAS TOLD THAT NO RECALL HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED, NO OTHER CONCERN OR CARE WAS GIVEN TO ME AT THAT TIME.  I DID ASK FOR THE CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY AND WAS GIVEN AN 800 NUMBER AND THE WEBSITE.    I TRIED CALLING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE OF TOYOTA TWICE TO REPORT MY EXPERIENCE, AND WAS ON HOLD FOR OVER 10 MINUTES BEFORE HANGING UP WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.   I CONTACTED MY DEALER AGAIN AND SPOKE WITH THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER, I ASKED THAT THEY REPORT MY EXPERIENCE TO YOU AND THAT THEY WORK TO ADVOCATE FOR A SOLUTION FOR THE BRAKE ISSUE. I AM AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM THEM.  I AGAIN TRIED THE 800 NUMBER WITHOUT SUCCESS AND THEN ACCESSED YOUR WEBSITE. I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE A PLACE TO SEND OR POST MY COMMENT/CONCERN, SO I WROTE THIS LETTER. PLEASE ADD ME TO THE 210 COMPLAINTS REPORTED FOR THE PRIUS BRAKING PROBLEM.

THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE BRAKE PROBLEM BEING DESCRIBED IN THE PREDICTED RECALL. MY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS: WHEN THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN AND THEN PARKED (SHUT DOWN ) AND STARTED AGAIN, THE BRAKES WILL LOCK UP AT THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. WHEN STARTING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT, EITHER FORWARD OR BACKWARD, THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE BRAKE PEDAL WILL LOCK THE BRAKES AND STAND THE CAR ON IT'S NOSE. I HAVE FOUND THAT IF THE PROBLEM OCCURS, I CAN EITHER STOP THE VEHICLE ( SHUT OFF WITH THE START BUTTON ) OR HOLD DOWN HARD ON THE PEDAL FOR 10 TO 20 SECONDS, THE BRAKES PERFORM NORMALLY. I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER IN AUGUST 2009 FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM, BUT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DISMISSED  THE COMPLAINT AS 'COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE COMPLAINT' EVEN THOUGH I EXPLAINED THAT IT DID NOT OCCUR EVERY TIME. I CAN NOT CONNECT THE PROBLEM WITH ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION. IT CAN OCCUR WITH NORMAL DRIVING OR IN ECO MODE. I FEEL IT IS AN ANNOYANCE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, BUT COULD POSE A PROBLEM IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. I WILL GLADLY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING THIS PROBLEM.

APPROXIMATELY ONCE A MONTH, WHEN I'M BRAKING OVER AN UNEVEN OR SLIPPERY SURFACE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CAR GOING OVER THE SLIPPERY SURFACE, WHILE I'M BRAKING, THERE IS A MOMENT LASTING LESS THAN A SECOND WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THE BRAKES DISENGAGE.

I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS DONE DELIBERATELY BY TOYOTA OR WHETHER THIS IS A DEFECT, HOWEVER, I BELIEVE MY SPEEDOMETER IS CALIBRATED SO THAT IT READS A SPEED THAT IS 2 MPH FASTER THAN MY ACTUAL SPEED.  I NOTICED THIS WHEN I WENT ON A TRIP AND USED MY WIFE'S TOM TOM, WHICH USES ITS GPS SIGNAL TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF THE CAR.  THE TOM TOM IS USUALLY SPOT ON IN MY WIFE'S ACURA.  IN THE PRIUS, IT WAS INDICATING THAT MY TRUE SPEED WAS 2 MPH LESS THAN WHAT MY SPEEDOMETER INDICATED.  I'M WONDERING IF THIS WASN'T SOMEHOW INTENTIONALLY DONE BY TOYOTA TO GET BETTER PERCEIVED GAS MILEAGE BY THE DRIVER.  HAVING THE CAR GET OVER THE 50 MPG THRESHOLD IS A BIG MARKETING ADVANTAGE FOR THEM.  GETTING OVER THIS THRESHOLD WOULD BE EASIER IF THE ACTUAL SPEED OF THE CAR WAS LESS THAN THE PERCEIVED SPEED.  *TW",

BUT IT IS TERRIFYING TO FEEL THAT YOUR CAR IS OUT OF CONTROL. IF I DROVE MY PRIUS MORE I AM CERTAIN I WOULD BE EXPERIENCING THIS DESIGN FLAW MORE. I ENCOURAGE  NHTSA TO BRING ITS REGULATORY WEIGHT TO BEAR TO FORCE TOYOTA TO FIX THIS PROBLEM--WHICH IT HAS FOR 2010 PRIUS'S SOLD AFTER JANUARY 2010.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER HITTING WHAT I THINK WAS A POT HOLE, I FELT THE CAR SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATE.  BOTH TIMES I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING.  AT THE TIME, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.  BUT, NOW THINKING ABOUT IT, I THINK IT LIKELY THAT THE SUDDEN JOLT TO THE CAR, PERHAPS COMBINED WITH MOISTURE, CAUSED SOME TYPE OF ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION, WHICH THANKFULLY, WAS SHORT-LIVED (OR AT LEAST STOPPED BY BRAKING).  SHORTLY AFTER THESE INCIDENTS, I MENTIONED THEM TO MY WIFE.  SHE REPORTED THAT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED VERY MUCH THE SAME THING ON A SEPARATE (I.E., A THIRD OCCASION) DRIVING OUR PRIUS.  *CN",

MY FIRST EXPERIENCE HAPPENED DURING OUR FIRST BIG SNOW FALL.  I WAS APPROACHING THE ENTRANCE RAMP TO AN EXPRESS WAY AND HAD TO APPLY THE BREAKS WHEN A CAR INFRONT OF ME BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN AND SLIDE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RAMP.  AS I APPLIED THE BREAKS, THE CAR BEGAN A SERIES OF QUICK FORWARD JERKS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOCKING SOUNDS.   I ALSO HEARD A SLIGHT CHANGE IN HOW THE ENGINE SOUNDED.  FORTUNATELY, I ESCAPED A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT SINCE MY PRIUS DRIFTED TO THE RIGHT BEFORE CONTROL WAS REESTABLISHED.   IT WAS FRIGHTENING.       THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED THAT HAS AN ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM.    I ASSUMED THAT IS WHY I EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF CONTROL AND WHY IT FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE.   WHEN I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT IT, I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO AN OPEN AREA AND PRACTICE USING THE BRAKES IN ORDER TO GET USED TO IT.   SINCE THEN, MY HUSBAND HAS HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WHILE TRYING TO STOP THE CAR ON ICY ROADS.    HE TELLS ME THAT THE \"JERKING\" AND THE KNOCKING SOUND IS NOT PART OF A NORMAL ANTI LOCK BREAKING SYSTEM.    THIS IS WHY I AM REPORTING OUR EXPERIENCE TO THE U.S. NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION.    THANK YOU. *TR",

THE BRAKES ENGAGE FOR A SECOND, AND THEN WE EXPERIENCE NO BRAKING AT ALL FOR NUMBER OF SECONDS.  WE TOOK OUR PRIUS INTO JON LANCASTER TOYOTA IN MADISON, WI WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND TOLD THE MECHANIC OF THE BRAKING ISSUES WE WERE EXPERIENCING .

THIS LACK OF BRAKING RESULTED IN A REAR END COLLISION IN DECEMBER 2009.  MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AT VERY LOW SPEED IN TOWN ONE EVENING AND THIS LACK OF BRAKING ISSUE OCCURRED AND HE SLID INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE. MY HUSBAND PUMPED THE BRAKES FOUR TIMES AND EACH TIME THIS DELAY IN BRAKING OCCURRED.  THERE WAS NO BRAKING HAPPENING AT ALL.  THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN FASTER WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED, THAN WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  THERE WAS FRESH SNOW ON THE ROAD.  THERE WAS A DANE COUNTY SHERIFF AT THE INTERSECTION AND MY HUSBAND AND THE PERSON HE HIT RAN THE INCIDENT BY THE STATE PATROL WHO AGREED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TWO PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT TO EXCHANGE INSURANCE AND CONTACT INFORMATION AND LEAVE THE SCENE WITHOUT CALLING THE LOCAL POLICE.

WHEN THIS OCCURS, I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THE CAR WILL STOP.  THIS DOES NOT OCCUR DURING BREAKING ON SMOOTH SURFACES.  I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE TOYOTA DEALER IN NOV. AND RECEIVED THIS RESPONSE:  WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 04, 2009 1:05 PM:   I'M RESPONDING TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE PRIUS BRAKING CONDITION. ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRIUS BRAKING SYSTEM IS THAT WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED THERE IS A SIGNAL TO THE GENERATOR TO ENGAGE. THIS DOES 2 THINGS, HELPS REGENERATE THE HYBRID BATTERY AND ASSISTS IN BRAKING THE VEHICLE, AND THE NORMAL BRAKES ALSO APPLY TO ASSIST IN BRAKING. I DID HAVE ANOTHER PRIUS OWNER ASK ABOUT THIS ALSO, I HAD HIM COME OUT AND DROVE WITH HIM AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE STATED CONDITION. I THINK HE WAS PUSHING TO FAST AND HARD ON THE BRAKE PEDAL CAUSING THE LURCH. WHEN I DROVE HIS VEHICLE I DID TELL HIM I WAS TRYING TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH PRESSURE I WAS APPLYING TO THE PEDAL. I DID NOTICE THE BRAKES ARE VERY RESPONSIVE TO PEDAL PRESSURE. BEFORE RESPONDING TO YOUR E-MAIL I DID CHECK ONLINE WITH TOYOTA TECHNICAL GROUP TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY PERTAINING SERVICE BULLETINS PERTAINING TO YOUR QUESTION, THERE WERE NO APPLICABLE BULLETINS.    I HOPE THIS HELPS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

IT SEEMED LIKE THE CAR ACTUALLY ACCELERATED MOMENTARILY AND I HAD TO  KEEP APPLYING THE BRAKES TO THE FLOOR AND HOPED THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH DISTANCE TO STOP. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN A HILL, APPLYING THE BRAKES  AND THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN, THEN I WENT OVER THE BUMP OR POTHOLE IN THE ROAD AND THE CAR TOOK OFF LIKE I WAS ACCELERATING. I FELT LIKE I HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST 2 SECONDS OR 20FEET  BUT FORTUNATELY NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE NEAR BY. I NOW MAKE SURE THAT I BRAKE SOONER, AND ALLOW MORE FOLLOWING DISTANCE. ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER. ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SEEM TO HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THAT THE WHEELS DON'T LOCK BUT  THOSE ON THE PRIUS SEEM A BIT MORE NOTICEABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTRIC AND THE PADS DON'T SLOW THE CAR LIKE NORMAL BRAKES. (AT LEAST THAT WHAT MY SALESMAN TOLD ME.) HE SAID THAT THE PADS WILL LAST OVER 200,000 MILES. HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT THAT LONG WITHOUT AN INCIDENT. BUT THE PROBLEM NOW IIS THAT PARENTS MAY NOT WANT THEIR KIDS TO LEARN WITH MY DRIVING SCHOOL, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO REAL PROBLEMS WITH TRAINING TEENAGERS YET. *TR",

I INQUIRED OF TOYOTA OF GLENDALE (CA) IF I SHOULD GET A RENTAL CAR FOR THE TIME BEING (HOPING TO BE OFFERED A LOANER) AND THEY TOLD ME NOT TO, AND TO 'DRIVE SAFE.' I'M TOTALLY LIVID, THIS IS A VERY SCARY PROBLEM TO EXPERIENCE. *TR",

THIS HAS HAPPEN QUITE A FEW TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  JUST YESTERDAY, WE HAD ABOUT 1-2 INCHES OF SNOW.  I WAS DRIVING SLOW AND WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN, THE CAR HIT SOME UNEVEN ROAD AND SNOW AND ACCELERATED WHEN I WAS STEPPING ON THE BRAKE TO MAKE THE TURN.  THE CAR WENT UP THE SIDEWALK AND THE BUMPER CRACKED AS IT HIT THE CONCRETE EDGE THAT SEPARATES THE ROAD AND THE SIDEWALK.  NO ONE WAS HURT AND NO PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS DONE.  THE CAR IS WORKING FINE, BUT THIS SUDDEN ACCELERATION ISSUE IS A MAJOR CONCERN, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I READ AND HEAR IN THE NEWS THAT 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS ARE BEING REPORTED WITH COMPLAINTS OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION.

THIS FAILURE IN THE VEHICLE IS SEEMINGLY UNRELATED TO A MECHANICAL ISSUE AND FEELS MORE LIKE AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE, SINCE THERE IS NO STIFF PEDAL OR OBSTRUCTION NEAR THE PEDAL. THE FAILURE OCCURS ON A SEMI-REGULAR BASIS.     I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE, SUBURBAN TOYOTA LOCATED IN TROY, MICHIGAN, AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM, APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS FROM THE TIME I BOUGHT THE CAR (JUNE 2009). THE MECHANICS KEPT THE VEHICLE OVER NIGHT. THE DEALER THEN REPORTED THAT THEY DID EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM WHEN TESTING THE VEHICLE AND SAID IT WAS RELATED TO THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM AND THAT THE CAR WAS DESIGNED  TO MOVE AROUND AN OBJECT RATHER THAN HEAVY BRAKING. THEY DID NOTHING TO FIX THE CAR. THE PROBLEM PERSISTS AND I HAVE HEARD SIMILAR COMPLAINTS OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, BOTH WHEN BRAKING AND COASTING.

ON INSPECTION WHEN I GOT HOME (4 HOUSES DOWN FROM THE INCIDENT) I NOTICED THE RIM OF THE RIGHT TIRE HAD BEEN CRACKED AND THE TIRE HAD SOME DAMAGE. I HAD TO WORK ON MON & TUES AND DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR ON THOSE DAYS. YESTERDAY, 02/03/10 I TOOK THE CAR TO HIBDON TIRES (2 BLOCKS AWAY) SINCE THE DEALERSHIP IS OVER 30 MILES AWAY AND I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY. THEY PUT ON THE SPARE TIRE AND DETERMINED THAT THE PASSENGER RIM WAS NOT REPAIRABLE, THE DRIVER RIM WAS INTACT AND BOTH TIRES WERE INTACT AND REUSABLE. THEY INDICATED THE AXLE DID NOT APPEAR DAMAGED.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED (2) INSTANCES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION DURING THE TIME SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE INFORMED DARCARS TOYOTA AND TOYOTA CORPORATION.  DARCARS RAN A \"HEALTH TEST\" ON FEBRUARY 4, 2009 ON MY VEHICLE AND THE TEST INDICATED EVERYTHING ON THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING NORMALLY.  DARCARS THEN CONTACTED THEIR TOYOTA CALIFORNIA (TAC) AND RELATED MY PROBLEM TO THEM.  THE RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA WAS THAT MY EPISODES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION WAS JUST THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGING NORMALLY.  THIS IS AFTER THE PRESS RELEASE FROM TOYOTA CORPORATION ON THE MORNING OF 02/04/10 ACKNOWLEDGING A PROBLEM EXISTING WITH THE 2010 PRIUS BUT CLAIMING TO HAVE ALREADY FIXED THE PROBLEM ON ALL NEW 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SOLD SINCE JANUARY 2010.  MY TWO QUESTIONS ARE 1) IF TOYOTA DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH THE 2010 PRIUS THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY REPAIRED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS VEHICLES SOLD SINCE JANUARY, WHY HAS TOYOTA NOT CONTACTED ME ABOUT WHAT IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE? I HAVE OWNED AND BEEN DRIVING MY 2010 PRIUS SINCE SEPTEMBER '09. 2) WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC REPAIR THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY PERFORMED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SINCE JANUARY 1, 2010?  WHY DID MY TOYOTA SERVICE MANAGER HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A REPAIR?  WAS THERE A SAFETY BULLETIN ISSUED BY TOYOTA?  WHY HAS TOYOTA NOT ALREADY AGREED TO REPAIR MY 2010 PRIUS (SOLD IN SEPTEMBER '09) WITH THE SAME REPAIR ALLEGEDLY ALREADY PERFORMED ON 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SOLD AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010?  *TR",

MY THEORY IS THAT WHILE BRAKING, A SINGLE WHEEL LOOSES TRACTION (AND PERHAPS MOMENTARILY STOPS) AND THEN THE SYSTEM RELEASES ALL WHEELS FOR A MOMENT BEFORE REGULAR BRAKING RESUMES.  THE FACT THAT YOU ARE SITTING IN THE CAR WITH YOUR FOOT APPLYING PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE MAKES THIS VERY ATTENTION GETTING.    THIS HAS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE GETTING THE CAR LAST AUGUST. *TR",

I START THE CAR (POWER BUTTON WITH FOOT ON THE BRAKE).  2. I PLACE THE SHIFT LEVER IN REVERSE OR DRIVE WITH FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  3. I RELEASE THE BRAKE PEDAL.  4. THE CAR EASES BACKWARD (OR FORWARD, AS THE CASE MAY BE).  5. I APPLY THE BRAKE , EITHER TO SHIFT INTO DRIVE OR TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC BEFORE CONTINUING.  6. SEVERAL TIMES PER WEEK THE BRAKES LOCK THE INSTANT MY FOOT TOUCHES THE BRAKE PEDAL.  7. WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS, THE LOCKING ACTION WILL REPEAT EACH TIME I RELEASE THE BRAKE, EASE BACKWARD OR FORWARD, AND BRAKE AGAIN.  8. THE BRAKE LOCKING IS SO INSTANTANEOUS THAT PASSENGERS' HEADS JERK AND THEY LOOK SURPRISED.  9. THE BRAKING ACTION IS MORE LIKE THAT OF FLIPPING AN ELECTRICAL SWITCH THAN OF PRESSING A BRAKE PEDAL.  10. FROM THE BEGINNING, I HAVE TRIED TO DETERMINE IF A CERTAIN SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS TRIGGERS THE LOCKING.  I CANNOT COME UP WITH ANYTHING.  SO FAR, THE ONLY CONSTANT IS THAT THIS LOCKING HAPPENS WITH THE FIRST STOPS AFTER STARTING THE CAR.  I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT WITH SUBSEQUENT STOPS.  HOWEVER, HEAVEN HELP US IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR AT HIGHER SPEEDS!      AT THE 5000 MILE SERVICE, I ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

THIS IS NOT TRUE. I OWN A 2007 PRIUS AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES BY OTHER 2010 PRIUS OWNERS ON THE PRIUSCHAT.COM WEBSITE. *TR",

WHEN I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALER, I HAD ABOUT 3000 MILES ON THE CAR, AND IT WAS ABOUT ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASE (EARLY JANUARY). AT THE TIME, THE BRAKES WERE CHECKED AND NO PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED.

I LIVE NEAR TRAIN TRACKS THAT HAVE A GRADE CROSSING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLOCK. THE CROSSING ITSELF IS IN  ANN ARBOR, MI, ON W. WILLIAM ST. BETWEEN S. ASHLEY ST AND S. 1ST ST.

THE BRAKING ACTION IS ONLY INTERRUPTED WHILE TRAVELING OVER THE BUMPY SURFACE OF THE RAIL TRACKS, AND THEN BRAKING ACTION IS RESTORED.

THE BRAKES LOCK WHEN THE CAR IS IN REVERSE.  BACKING OUT OF THE GARAGE, YOU CAN JUST BARELY TOUCH THE BRAKES AND IT'S AS THOUGH YOU HAD SLAMMED THE FULL FORCE OF YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKES.  LITERALLY CAN CAUSE WHIPLASH EVEN AT THE SLOW SPEED OF BACKING OUT.   WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS IT WILL OCCUR OVER AND OVER AS LONG AS YOU ARE IN REVERSE.  EACH TIME WHEN YOU SLIGHTLY DEPRESS THE BRAKES, THE CAR SLAMS TO A COMPLETE STOP.   WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT IT, HAS BEEN TO TURN OFF THE CAR COMPLETELY AND RE-START THE CAR.      IT MAY JUST BE COINCIDENCE, BUT TYPICALLY THE BRAKES RETURN TO COMPLETELY NORMAL OPERATIONS IN REVERSE AFTER THE IGNITION HAS BEEN SHUT OFF AND THE VEHICLE ENGINE RESTARTED.      THE GREATEST ODDITY IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE BRAKES DO NOT RESPOND IN THE SAME DEGREE AS THE BRAKES ARE DEPRESSED. IT'S AS THOUGH THE BRAKES WHEN DEPRESSED EVEN SLIGHTLY MESSAGE THE CAR TO EXERT FULL BRAKING ACTION.  IT'S THE ONLY CAR WE'VE EVER OWNED WHERE THE BRAKING POWER SEEMS NOT TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE WITH WHICH WE PRESS THE BRAKES.  AGAIN, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY TIME WE HAVE THE CAR IN REVERSE, BUT TYPICALLY BETWEEN ONCE A MONTH AND EVERY SIX WEEKS. *TR",

I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN 10 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN OCT OF 09.  IN THE FIRST MONTH THE DEALER TOLD ME THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS. TWO MONTHS AGO (DEC)A MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE ELECTRIC ENGINE KICKS IN (WHEN REGENATIVE BREAKING) WHICH DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS FOR A SMOOTHER BREAKING, SO HE SURMISED THAT IF THE BREAKING WHEELS ARE NOT MAKING CONTACT THE CAR WOULD SPEED UP.  ON 1/13/2010 I MET WITH THE HEAD OF SERVICE FOR THE DEALERSHIP.  HE TOLD ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP TESTED A PRIUS HOOKING IT UP TO A COMPUTER AND REPRODUCED THE ENVIRONMENT OF THIS COMPLAINT. ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THERE WAS A MOMENTARY LACK OF BREAKING WITH THE LOSS OF BACK WHEEL CONTACT WITH THE PAVEMENT HE CLAIMED THERE WAS NO ACCELERATION NOTED.  HE ALSO ADMITTED THE TEST WAS DONE AT APPROX. 25MPH.  I SUGGESTED HE SHOULD REPEAT THE TEST AT 40-50MPH AS THIS IS WHERE IT IS MOST NOTABLE.  TOYOTA'S ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO DRIVE CAREFULLY.  THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT THIS IS THERE SOLUTION.  I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL BUT ON 1/31/10 I WAS DRIVING AT 45MPH BEGINNING TO DECELERATE AS THE LIGHT AHEAD HAD TURNED RED, AND THE TRUCK INFRONT OF ME HAD TO PANIC STOP AS A CAR CUT INFRONT OF HIM, AT THAT MOMENT MY REAR LEFT WHEEL HIT A POTHOLE SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO BRAKE AND ACTUALLY ACCELERATED TOWARD THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK.  WHEN THE BRAKES REENGAGED I ACTUALLY STOPPED 12 INCHES FROM HIS BUMPER.

THEY SAID THEY HAD NO OTHER REPORTS AND COULD NOT REPLICATE IT. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOOK ME ON A TEST DRIVE AND THE CAR WAS FINE. I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN AS THE ACCELERATION IS ONLY OCCASIONAL. I WAS ADVISED TO CALL TOYOTA NATIONAL, WHICH I DID, AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THIS COULD NOT BE REPLICATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND NO RECOURSE I HAD AS THE COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE REPLICATED. IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE, SO I HAVE PAID CLOSE ATTENTION, AS MY HEART HAS BEEN RACING, TO THE CONDITIONS. IT HAS HAPPENED WHEN I AM BRAKING WHILE GOING OVER MANHOLES, SPEED STRIPS, CRACKS IN THE PAVEMENT.

THE HUMMER BRAKES EVEN WITH THE CHANGES.  I HAVE ALSO COMPARED ON A 2006 VOLVO S60.  THESE BRAKES ARE FAILING AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A CRASH OR A PEDESTRIAN BEING STRUCK.  THERE IS NO PULSING OF THE BREAKS THERE IS ONLY RELEASING FOR ICE OR FOR ANY SURFACE OTHER THAN PERFECT.  THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF REPAIR OR RECALL IMMEDIATELY.  I HAVE NOTICED THIS BUT THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ME UNTIL I SAW THE MSNBC ARTICLE.  I WILL NOT LET MY WIFE DRIVE THIS CAR SINCE SHE IS PREGNANT.  IT IS NOT SAFE.

AFTER DRIVING IT FOR TWO WEEKS CAR DESIGN HAS CAUSED A LIFE-TREATING SITUATION FOR DRIVER AND TWO PASSENGERS (ONE OF THEM BEING A CHILD) BY STOPPING AT THE INTERSECTION IN A NON-DRIVABLE CONDITION IN A WAY OF HIGH TRAFFIC IN THE NIGHT. CAR HAD TO BE BLOCKED OUT BY POLICE FOR 1.5 HOURS AND LATER TOWED TO DEALERSHIP.    LATER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT INABILITY TO DRIVE WAS CAUSED BY INSTRUMENTAL PANEL LIGHT DIMMER TURNING OFF INSTRUMENTAL PANEL WHEN HEADLIGHTS ARE SWITCHED ON. NOTE THAT DIMMER ITSELF WAS NOT OPERATED BY THE DRIVER (IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOVED UNINTENTIONALLY SOME TIMES EARLIER) AND ACTUAL ACT OF TURNING INSTRUMENTAL PANEL OFF WAS TRIGGERED BY TURNING ON HEADLIGHTS WHICH INCREASED DIMMING LEVEL TO \"FULL OFF\" STATE.     THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE ANY \"NON-ELECTRONIC\" INSTRUMENTAL PANEL AND SO IS NOT DRIVABLE WITH IT OFF. IN FACT BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER WAS NOT AWARE THAT CAR IS EVEN ON AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO \"DRIVE\" SHIFT INDICATOR EXCEPT ON INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND FIRST REACTION WAS TO TRY AND RESTART THE CAR, WHICH FURTHER MAKE DRIVE SHIFT POSITION UNCERTAIN.    THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE DESIGN. DIMMER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE  TO MAKE CARE NOT OPERABLE. IN THIS CAR WITHOUT ANY NON-ELECTRONIC  INSTRUMENTAL PANEL, IT SHOULD BE NEVER POSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY  TURN IT OFF. THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE ELIMINATED TO PREVENT AN  EVENTUALLY FATAL ACCIDENT THAT IS WAITING TO HAPPEN (OR MAYBE  ALREADY HAPPENED).     NOTE THAT CAR MANUAL DOES NOT MENTION:  1) THAT INSTRUMENTAL PANEL CAN BE COMPLETELY OFF WITH THE DIMMER  2) THAT THERE IS A DEPENDENCY BETWEEN DIMMING LEVEL AND HEADLIGHTS.

THERE IS ONE POST IN PRIUSCHAT FORUM THAT BEST EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM: JUST YESTERDAY, MY PRIUS-III BACKED UP WITH SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, WITH MY FOOT ONLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.... I RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE, JUST OVER 2 MONTHS AGO. JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER I GOT THE CAR. WHEN I WAS BACKING OUT OF AN INCLINED DRIVEWAY...  I SUSPECT THAT SOME UNUSUAL ELEMENT OF THE TIMING OF TURNING THE CAR ON AND SHIFTING INTO REVERSE, AND POSSIBLY THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE COMPUTER AND THE HYBRID POWER SYSTEM COMBINE TO PRODUCE THIS \"ABRUPT\" REVERSE ACCELERATION AS I AM GENTLY EASING OFF MY FOOT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL... THE ABRUPT BRAKING EFFECT DOES OCCUR, BUT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS \"UNEXPECTED, UNINTENDED\" REVERSE POWER (ACCELERATION), TO STOP THE CAR MOTION. NO MATTER HOW GENTLY THE BRAKE IS EASED FURTHER ON TO STOP, THE STOP IS \"ABRUPT\"  BY GARYGID ORANGE COUNTY, CA. I AM TRYING TO WORK WITH TOYOTA ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. *TR",
