NO NISSAN DEALERSHIP OR REPAIR SHOP WAS OPEN SO I CALLED THE NEAREST PEP BOYS SHOP TO MY HOME AND THEY TOWED MY CAR TO THEIR REPAIR SHOP. THEY SAID MY CAR WAS TOTALLY DEAD AND NEEDED A NEW BATTERY EVEN THOUGH MY BATTERY WASN'T THAT OLD. I PURCHASED A BATTERY, STILL WOULDN'T START. PEP BOYS THEN SAID I NEEDED A NEW ALTERNATOR, SO THAT WAS INSTALLED, STILL WOULDN'T START. THEY THEN SAID IT MUST BE THE ENGINE, SO THE NEXT DAY, MONDAY, MARCH 4, 2018, IT WAS TOWED TO THE FAIRFIELD, CT NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE IT IS CURRENTLY UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AFTER 3 DAYS, OF CALLING THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR, BET, IN THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TAKEN OFF THE SIDE OF MY ENGINE AND TRIED TO MANUALLY TURN THE DRIVE SHAFT, BUT IT WOULDN'T TURN AND THAT IT WAS THE TIMING CHAIN AND THAT IT WOULD COST ANYWHERE FROM $2,600.00 TO $3,600.00 TO REPAIR MY CAR.

SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, THE TRANSMISSION RANDOMLY BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AT SPEEDS OF 20-30MPH AT WHICH TIME THE RPMS WOULD INCREASE RAPIDLY WITH LOSS OF ACCELERATION. ANOTHER TRANSMISSION FLUSH WAS PERFORMED AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED WORSE. FINALLY WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70MPH THE VEHICLES TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY \"SLAMMED\" THEN THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ACTIVATED WITH A NOTICEABLE POWER LOSS. UPON SLOWING DOWN TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY THE VEHICLE STALLED AND DIED. IT RESTARTED BUT THE THROTTLE WAS RESTRICTED. THE VEHICLES GEAR WAS CHANGED TO MANUAL MODE AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS STUCK IN 5TH GEAR. AT THAT POINT THE VEHICLE GOT STUCK IN 5TH GEAR AFTER 15-20 MIN OF DRIVING AND THE LOW SPEED POWER LOSS BECAME ALMOST CONSTANT. THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER DRIVEN UNTIL IT WAS PUT ON DIAGNOSTICS BY A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST ($60) AND THE CODE INDICATED THE FAILURE OF 3 SENSORS: CAM POSITION SENSOR, ELECTRONIC ACCELERATION POSITION SENSOR AND TRANSMISSION SPEED SENSOR. THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WAS CONTACTED TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE ERROR CODES AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH NO SUGGESTIONS OTHER THAN REPLACING THE SENSORS. THE ELECTRONIC ACCELERATION POSITION SENSOR REQUIRED A NEW THROTTLE BODY WHICH WAS THEN REPLACED ($115). THE 2 CAM SENSORS ($120) AND TRANSMISSION SPEED SENSOR, AKA TRANSMISSION REVOLUTION OUTPUT SENSOR, WERE THEN PURCHASED ($125).  I HAD TO TAKE THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER AND PAY ANOTHER $365 TO GET THE NEW SENSORS FLASHED.  THE PROBLEM STILL REMAINS.  I'M NOW LOOKING AT GETTING THE TRANNY REPLACED.    *TR",

THE EVENT OCCURS AROUND AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 25-30 MPH DURING DOWNSHIFTING OF THE TRANSMISSION. THE EXPERIENCE FEELS LIKE SOMEONE HAS CRASHED INTO YOU FROM THE REAR...AND THE FORCE FROM THE GEARING THRUST THROWS THE CAR FORWARD VIOLENTLY. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME THE CAR IS DRIVEN AND IS A CRITICAL SAFETY CONCERN FOR US. VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO WESLEY CHAPEL NISSAN DEALERSHIP LOCATED IN WESLEY CHAPEL, FLORIDA FOR AN INSPECTION AND THE TECH SAID THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $3300 FOR PARTS & LABOR. AS REFLECTED IN THE LOW MILEAGE, THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN VERY LITTLE AND HAS BEEN METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED BY HER AND HAS REMAINED GARAGED THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT NUMEROUS 2004 MAXIMA OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TRANSMISSION (FAILURE) PROBLEMS WITH SIMILAR MILEAGE RANGE, BUT NO RECALL WAS EVER ACTIVATED BY THE NISSAN COMPANY TO REMEDY THE ISSUE. HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ISSUED FOR A FEW NISSAN MODELS REGARDING FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS EXCLUDING THE MAXIMA. CALLED CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT NISSAN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT WAS TOLD BY REP THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE THE WARRANTY FOR THE VEHICLE HAD EXPIRED. I EXPLAINED TO THE REP THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM SINCE THIS IS A RECURRING THEME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPECIFIC YEAR OF THE MAXIMA MODEL.    *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION NOW IS STUCK IN 5TH GEAR WHEN YOU SWITCH TO THE TIP TRONIC SETTING TO SEE THE GEARING AND THIS IS THE REASON THERE IS NO POWER DURING ACCELERATION. WE ALSO NEED MOTOR MOUNTS NOW BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENT JERKING THAT THE TRANNY DOES WHEN PUT INTO GEAR. AND THE DEALERSHIP ALSO SAID WE NEEDED A TIMING CHAIN REPLACEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS BAD AS WELL, TOTAL REPAIR COST $6700.00+. I'VE RECENTLY TAKEN MY CAR TO ANOTHER MECHANIC AND HE SAID THE TIMING CHAIN WAS PERFECTLY FINE. OUR DRIVER SIDE WINDOW SWITCHES DO NOT WORK AGAIN, THAT WAS REPLACED 1YR AGO.

MECHANICS RECOMMENDED A TRANSMISSION FLUSH, BUT AREN'T SURE HOW TO DO IT ON THE NISSAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE CERTAIN HOSES THAT THEIR MACHINE HOOKS UP TO.

THIS PROBLEMS HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS AT OPERATING TEMPERATURE. I SWITCH FROM AUTOMATIC TO STANDARD AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO JUMP INTO AND OUT OF GEAR. SEVERAL TIMES IT HAS GOTTEN STUCK IN 5TH GEAR.

I GOT NOTHING. THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO HELP.  I CALLED NISSAN MOTORS OF AMERICA AND I TOLD THEM ABOUT MY SITUATION. NISSAN TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME. I ASKED WHY, THEY SAID THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY. I SAID I KNOW THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THAT IS WHY I'M CALLING THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS LINE. I TOLD THEM THAT I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR ALL MY SERVICE, THAT I ALWAYS PURCHASED ALL THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE THAT THE MANUFACTURE AND DEALER RECOMMEND, I'M THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND THAT I ONLY DRIVE THE CAR TO WORK.  I ASKED WHAT IS THE CRITERIA FOR NISSAN TO ASSIST A CUSTOMER IF A CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.

AS OF JULY 2010 MY CAR CANNOT DRIVE MORE THAN 15 MILES AT A TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE OFF THE BATTERY AND RESET THE CAR SO IT CAN GO ANOTHER 15 MILES.  I STILL OWE MONEY ON THIS VEHICLE AND YET I HAD TO GO BUY ANOTHER CAR JUST SO I CAN GET TO WORK.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS!! WHEN IS NISSAN GOING TO OWN UP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO GET SEVERELY HURT OR LOSE THEIR LIFE IN ORDER FOR NISSAN TO RECOGNIZE.  I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WITH THE SAME VEHICLE AND HAVE THE SAME ISSUE, AND HAVE SPENT $1,000+ AT NISSAN FOR THEM TO FIX EVERYTHING BUT THE TRANSMISSION.  WE HAVE DONE MOTOR MOUNT REPLACEMENTS & TRANSMISSION FLUSHES AND STILL HAVE PROBLEMS.  WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO STAND UP FOR THE CONSUMERS AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS? I AM PAYING A CAR NOTE AND INSURANCE TO SEE MY CAR SIT IN MY PARKING LOT EVERYDAY. THE CAR JERKS VIOLENTLY, AND GETS WORSE OVER TIME. 500 COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED ON HERE, AND STILL NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BLOGS AND WEBSITES OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME THING. I CONTACTED MY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND RECEIVED BASICALLY NO HELP. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN!  *TR",

I JUST SPOKE WITH DELAND NISSAN TO SEE IF THEY WERE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS CONSIDERING HOW    MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE AND THEY STATED NO.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER NISSAN EVER AND WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAN BE DONE AGAINST THIS COMPANY. *TR",

WHENEVER THE ENGINE IS COLD IT SHIFTS SO SMOOTHLY LIKE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. BUT THIS GOOD FEELING DOESN'T LAST MORE THAN 7 MIN.ENGINE STARTS HEATING UP AND JERKING PROBLEMS BEGINS. P TO R IS OK.

AND THIS WILL LEAD TO ULTIMATE TRANNY DISTRUCTION. SO I HAVE TO PAY AT EAST $700 TO GET THIS FIXED?WHY DOESN'T NISSAN DO A RECALL ON THIS? I KNOW THERE'S AT LEAST 200 MAXIMA OWNERS THERE(FROM ALL THE FORUMS I'VE READ)THAT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THEY LOVE GETTING MONEY SELLING THEIR CARS,AND THEN WHEY MAKE A MISTAKE ON BUILDING IT THEY DON'T WANNA TAKE THE BLAME.

I HAD TO TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY TO GET HOME. WHILE HOME, I DECIDED TO RESEARCH MY PROBLEM WITH MY CAR ON THE INTERNET. TO MY SURPRISE, THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE SAME COMPLAINT WITH THE EXACT SAME MAKE OF CAR LISTED ON NUMEROUS WEB SITES. THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION IS A 2004 NISSAN MAXIMA. FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE RESEARCHED, NISSAN NORTH AMERICA WILL NOT DO ANYTHING NOR ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM EVEN EXISTS. FROM A SAFETY POINT OF VIEW, THIS PROBLEM IS JUST AS BAD AS A STUCK ACCELERATOR. I WONDER HOW MANY DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT AS MANY OF THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED WERE NOT ABLE TO REPORT WHAT HAD OCCURRED. WITH THE NUMBER OF 2004 NISSAN MAXIMA'S ON THE ROAD AND THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS REPORTED, THE NHTSA AND NISSAN NA SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PREVENT FURTHER POSSIBLE INJURY AND DEATH. MY CAR IS NOW STUCK IN 5TH GEAR AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ANY LONGER AS THIS DEFECT CAN CAUSE MANY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS TO OCCUR. I WILL BE COPYING THIS COMPLAINT TO THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. *TR",

I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW MOTOR MOUNT, WHICH I REPLACED ON FEBRUARY 19, 2010 FOR $484.00.  AFTER DRIVING IT HOME, STILL EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  SO WE TOOK IT BACK TO FURTHER DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, WERE TOLD THE SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THAT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY, WE WERE TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT WE NEEDED A TRANSMISSION.   MY TRANSMISSION CONTINUES TO BANG WHEN DOWNSHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 1ST GEAR.  IT ALSO SURGES WHEN ACCELERATING AFTER SLOWING DOWN AND HESITATES AT LEAST A 10 SECONDS BEFORE ENGAGING INTO GEAR.  WHEN IN PARK OR NEUTRAL, THE TRANSMISSION BANGS WHEN DRIVING OFF  FROM 1ST TO 2ND.  .  I AM TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT I AM GOING TO NEW TO PURCHASE A NEW TRANSMISSION IN ORDER TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I AM SO AFRAID THE DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE IT SLIPS AND HESITATES.  THIS IS SCARY, ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY.  I HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE A FATALITY FOR NISSAN TO FACE UP TO THEIR PROBLEMS.

I HAVE TO AVOID HILLY AREAS & PARKING STRUCTURES WITH LARGE GRADES BECAUSE THE CAR WILL NOT NEGOTIATE IT WELL & START ROLLING BACKWARDS.

WHILE DRIVING HER CAR WILL \"BANG\" INTO SECOND GEAR.  OCCASIONALLY SHIFTING WILL BE SO HARD THAT IT PULLS HER CAR INTO ANOTHER LANE.  ON CHRISTMAS EVE '09, SHE WAS DRIVING TO HER PARENTS HOUSE IN A LIGHT RAIN & THE HARD SHIFT PULLED HER INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  LUCKILY THE OTHER DRIVERS WERE ABLE TO AVOID HER.  SHE HAD HER 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE BACKSEAT.  SHE NO LONGER DRIVES THE CAR BUT LIKE ME, THEY HAVE PAYMENTS LEFT ON IT & CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE.    ESTIMATED COST OF A NEW TRANSMISSION RANGES FROM $3000 - $4500.  MECHANICS LOCALLY HERE KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE & A NUMBER OF THEM ADVISE AGAINST FIXING THE TRANSMISSIONS AS IT'S BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN AGAIN WITH NEW TRANSMISSIONS.

AAMCO WANTS TO PUT IN \"UPDATED SOLENOID\" THAT WAS RE-ENGINEERED AFTER PEOPLE STARTED HAVING THESE PROBLEMS AND REPLACED THE PARTS CONTAMINATED WITH THE DEBRIS (BASICALLY OVERHAUL THE TRANNY) APPARENTLY, THE SOLENOID MATERIAL BREAKS OFF AND GOES THROUGHOUT THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING DEBRIS BUILD UP AND EVENTUAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE. PLACING NEW TRANSMISSION DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE IT IS AN ENGINEERING FLAW WITH THE SOLENOID.  THE FIX IS TO PUT IN THE RE-ENGINEERED UPDATED SOLENOID SO DOESN'T BREAK APART AND CAUSE DEBRIS THROUGHOUT TRANSMISSION LIKE THE ONE ORIGINAL SOLENOID ASSEMBLY PLACED IN CAR.

I TOOK THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS AGO AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION SO THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION BE FLUSHED AND THE FLUID BE REPLACED.  AFTER THIS WAS DONE THE CAR RODE FINE FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS AND RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL THRASHING AND JERKING.  KNOCKING SO HARD AT TIMES THAT IT CAUSES ME TO HAVE HEADACHES AND MY HEAD TO HIT THE HEAD REST.  IRONICALLY THE TRANSMISSION ONLY DOES THIS ONLY WHEN THE CAR HAS WARMED UP. I HAVE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE SAME NISSAN DEALER I WENT TO PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR THIS FRIDAY REGARDING THIS SAME ISSUE.  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO OWN THIS MAKE AND MODEL WHO SHARE THE SAME ISSUES IS ASTRONOMICAL AND IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR NISSAN AND THEIR MECHANICS TO NOT BE AWARE OF IT.  IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE IS NO ONE ADMITTING THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS OR ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE. TO SAY THE LEAST, DRIVING THIS CAR IS SCARY AND UNSAFE.  DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC COULD BE DISASTROUS WITH A CAR IN THIS CONDITION ALONG WITH SLOWING DOWN TO TURN A CORNER OR ANY SITUATION WHEN YOU MAY NEED TO ACCELERATE OR STOP QUICKLY.  SOMEONE PLEASE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND HOLD NISSAN RESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS A HUGE ETHICAL ISSUE THAT RAISES MANY SAFETY CONCERNS AND HAS BEEN BRUSHED UNDER THE RUG FOR YEARS! *TR",

I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER AND WITHOUT TELLING THEM WHAT THE LOCAL REPAIR SHOP SAID, ONLY SUMMARIZING THE EXPLANATION OF THE NOISE WHEN ENGINE WAS COLD AND THEN GOES AWAY AFTER WARM UP, THE SERVICE ADVISOR INTERRUPTED ME AND SAID, \"IT'S THE TIMING CHAIN GUIDE\". HE BARELY LET ME FINISH THE STORY BEFORE HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS. HE SAID THAT WAS BECAUSE HE (HIS SERVICE CENTER) HAS DONE THIS REPAIR ON 04 MAXIMA'S SO MANY TIMES IT'S RIDICULOUS. HE ALSO STATED THAT IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY NISSAN AS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 04 MODEL ENGINES BUT YET WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIRS.

THE LABOR TO REPAIR THE SURROUNDING PARTS IS THE SAME TO REPLACE THE CHAIN SINCE THE TECH HAS TO REACH TO THE SAME SPOT OF THE ENGINE FOR REPAIRS. I WAS ORIGINALLY QUOTED $1500.+ FOR THE REPAIRS BUT WAS ABLE TO STRIKE A SMALL DISCOUNT AND PAID $1133.55 FOR \"2 TENSIONER CHAINS\", \"CHAIN GUIDE\", \"TENSIONER ASSEMBLY\", AND SOME OTHER SEALS & GASKETS.

APPARENTLY THE DEALERSHIP STATES I WILL NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION WHICH IS ABSURD SINCE THE CAR IS NOT EVEN 10 YRS OLD. I KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHEN THE CAR STARTED JERKING ON ITS OWN. AT TIMES IT JERKS REAL HARD WHEN SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND AND IT IS QUITE SCARY & EMBARRASSING. WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED, I HAVE TWO FRIENDS WHO WERE OWNERS OF A NISSAN MAXIMA AS WELL AND THEY WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME JERKING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. THEY EVENTUALLY TRADED THEIR CARS BUT I NOT WANTED TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF FINANCING A CAR, I FIGURED I'LL FIX THE PROBLEM. THE TRANSMISSION IS ONE PROBLEM BUT WHY EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE IS  OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE I LAST YEAR I HAD TO CHANGE MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER, MY MOUNTS, AND MY ROUTERS. NOW WHAT HAS MADE ME AT MY ENDS WITH THIS CAR IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST MONTH (JUNE 2009). WHILE DRIVING, THERE WAS A LOUD SOUND, I OPENED THE HOOD OF THE CAR AND RIGHT BUY THE ENGINE, AND THERE WERE FLAMES. THE FIRE DEPT WAS CALLED ALONG WITH THE POLICE. AS I SUBMIT MY COMPLAINT NOW MY CAR IS STILL AT THE SHOP. THIS HAS BECOME A FRUSTRATED AND VERY EXPENSIVE ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN FACING. HONESTLY I HAVE SPENT ABOUT 5K'S OR MORE ON THIS CAR, NOT CONSIDERING THAT I'M STILL FINANCING AS WELL. HOW IS IT THAT, I HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OUT THERE WHO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE ALSO. I HAVE DOCUMENTS AND EMAILS FROM OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE (OVER 300 COMPLAINTS SINCE 2006). PLS IF ANYTHING, THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION, MANY PPL ARE SUFFERING AND LOSING $ AS WELL. *TR",

ALTHOUGH I ONLY WORK 1.8 MILES FROM MY HOME, I COULD FEEL THE \"DIFFERENCE\" IN THE TRANSMISSION FROM ANY OTHER TIME.  I HAVE 63,000 MILES ON MY CAR AND FOR A FIVE YEAR OLD CAR, THAT IS VERY LOW. I MAINTAIN THE VEHICLE ACCORDINGLY AND ABOUT 8 MONTHS AGO, I HAD THE TRANSMISSION FLUID FLUSHED, ETC. THE SECOND DAY (TODAY), I STARTED UP THE CAR, PUT IT IN DRIVE AND QUICKLY NOTICED IT WAS GOING TO STRAIN ITSELF INTO 2ND GEAR. ONCE IT DID, THERE WAS A HARD JERK IN GETTING THERE.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE THE CAR TO MY HOME, PARKED IT AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR IT TO BE CHECKED OUT TOMORROW MORNING. THEN I WENT ONLINE TO SEARCH FOR ANY NISSAN 2004 TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS SUCH AS MINE AND FOUND A LOT OF WEB-SITES THAT PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED THE EXACT HAPPENINGS THAT OCCURRED TO MY VEHICLE. THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY DEFECTIVE WITH AT LEAST THE 2004 TRANSMISSIONS.  MANY PEOPLE'S COMMENTS ALWAYS STATED THAT THERE'S OCCURRED RIGHT AFTER 60,000 MILES. MY CAR HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN HARD AND IS WELL MAINTAINED.  I READ ALSO ABOUT 2 OTHER ITEMS THAT OCCURRED TO MY VEHICLE. ONE IS THE DRIVERS POWER WINDOW WILL NOT CLOSE UP AND STAY CLOSED WHEN THE BUTTON IS PUSHED.  I DISCOVERED A WAY TO GET THE WINDOW CLOSED BY  HOLDING THE BUTTON IN THE UP POSITION, TURN OFF THE CAR AND OPEN THE DOOR, WHILE KEEPING YOUR FINGER ON THE POWER UP BUTTON.  SECONDLY, PEOPLE WROTE ABOUT A AC REFRIGERANT HOSE HAVING LEAKS AND NEEDING TO BE REPLACED BY SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS.  MINE ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM SOME TIME BACK. THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME IS THIS TRANSMISSION FAILING RIGHT AFTER 60,000 MILES. IT MENTIONS THAT WHEN THEY PUT IT ON A MACHINE TO TEST, IT SHOWS NOTHING IS WRONG, WHICH OBVIOUSLY IT IS. NISSAN HAS TOLD PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS EITHER. *TR",

THIS WAS A VERY SELDOM THING AT FIRST AND I ASSUMED THAT I MAY HAVE TAKEN MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE TOO FAST NOT ALLOWING IT  TIME TO GET TO THE GEAR.  I HAD ABOUT 90K MILES THEN.  IT STARTED TO DO IT MORE THAN JUST GOING INTO REVERSE OR DRIVE BUT ALSO WHEN I WOULD ACCELERATE AND SLOW DOWN OR STOP.  I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY COULD NOT DETECT ANYTHING AT FIRST.  I BROUGHT IT AGAIN AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS JERKING AND THE SERVICE ENGINE WAS NOW COMING ON.  THEY HAD A LIST OF CODES.  I WAS INSTRUCTED TO BRING IT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST.  I TOOK IT TO 2 OUT OF TOWN AND ONE LOCAL.  IT WAS STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED @ A COST OF 4,100$ APPROX.  I WAS NOT FINANCIALLY ABLE TO HANDLE THIS COST AND PAY A $570 CAR AS WELL.  I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT IS MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM WORK.  THE JERKING CAME AND WENT UNTIL NOW IT DOES IT EVERYTIME ALL THE TIME WHEN I AM DRIVING.  IT HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE.  IT W IT NOW HAS ABOUT 112,000K.  LAST WEEK 3/26 IT LEFT ME AT THE DRIVE UP WINDOW OF THE BANK.  I HAD TO HAVE SOMEONE PUSH ME OUT OF THE WAY.  DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF OTHER NISSAN OWNERS THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AS I AM I FEEL THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH OUR VEHICLES THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NISSAN.  I AM COMPLAINING BECAUSE I HAVE TAKEN GREAT CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND IT HAS FAILED ME NOT BECAUSE OF NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR BUT BECAUSE OF AN OBVIOUS MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  I CONSIDER THIS VEHICLE AN ENDANGERMENT BECAUSE WITH THE JERKING WHICH FEELS LIKE WHIPLASH YOU ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN IT MAY JERK CAUSING A HALT OR IF YOU NEED TO SPEED UP OR PASS SOMEONE YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT WILL SMOOTHLY OR JUST JERK AND WHINE CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.

I HAPPENED TO HAVE IT STARTED AGAIN. HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE THE CAR ANYMORE, BECAUSE  I AM AFRAID OF SUCH INCIDENT HAPPENING AGAIN. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE  TRANSMISSION IS NOT BEING RECALLED, EVEN THOUGHT THE PROBLEM IS WELL-KNOWN AMONG THE PART SHOPS AND THE MECHANICS. SOMETIMES, THE ENGINE REVVS UP WITHOUT BEING ENGAGED AND SOMETIMES THE CARD MOVES VERY SLOWLY WITH DEAD POOR. I CONTACTED MY MECHANICS AND DISCUSSED ABOUT THE SITUATION. HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM IS WELL KNOWN AND 2004 MAXIMA TRANSMISSION WAS ONLY OF THAT YEAR MODEL AND NISSAN CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION MODEL TO DIFFERENT ONE IN 2005. NISSAN KNEW THIS PROBLEM.

ON 2/6/2009, I TOOK THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER & I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A TRANSMISSION WHICH WILL COST ME $4507.00,I NEED A RIGHT ENGINE MOUNT WHICH WILL COST $361.00, BOTH FRONT STRUTS ARE MAKING A CHUCKING NOISE...$832.00, LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS ARE BROKEN...$809.00.

IN MY INVESTIGATING I FOUND THAT THERE IS ALOT OF COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS SAME EXACT ISSUE AND THE MILEAGE SOMETIMES IS JUST 60KM OR EVEN LOWER THUS PROVING THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT MILEAGE RELATED BUT PART RELATED.

THE DEALERSHIPS ONLY ANSWER IS TO REPAIR OR REPLACE CAR, BECAUSE THE PROBLEM STARTED BEFORE THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED THEN THE REPAIRS SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF ,IN MY OPINION BUT ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, IF YOU ARE NOT BROKEN DOWN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THEN THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT COMPLETELY BROKEN SO NISSAN WILL NOT REPAIR.  THIS I HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE ONCE THE PART IS NOT PERFORMING ITS FUNCTION THEN REPAIRS SHOULD BE DONE AS IT IS BROKEN, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CEASED IN ITS COMPLETE FUNCTION BUT AS LONG  AS A PART OF THE IT HAS  CEASED THEN SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK TO  ITS FUNCTION AND THIS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE COST OF THE CONSUMER ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH INCLUDES THIS PART OF THE VEHICLE.

THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO DO AND ISSUE A RECALL ON ALL 2004 NISSAN MAXIMA'S - WITH THE WAY THE ECONOMY IS GOING RIGHT  NOW, THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE.

AFTER THE FIX, THE CAR GOT BETTER FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SO, BUT NOW I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AGAIN.

NISSAN SHOULD REALLY BE ASHAMED OF THE PRODUCT THEY PRODUCED, THE SO CALLED 2004 NISSAN MAXIMA.  *TR",

BASIC SYMPTOM HAS BEEN IF THE CAR SITS IDLING IN TRAFFIC JAM, OR AFTER A 3-4 STOP AND GO LOCAL TRIPS, I DEVELOP A LOT OF PLAY IN THE CLUTCH PEDAL. NORMALLY, WHEN I APPLY LIGHT PRESSURE TO THE CLUTCH PEDAL, I FEEL RESISTANCE IMMEDIATELY. WHEN ITS ACTING UP, I FEEL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RESISTANCE IN THE PEDAL FROM THE TOP, SOMETIME ALMOST HALF WAY THROUGH THE PEDAL TRAVEL. IF I CONTINUE DRIVING IT USUALLY CLEARS UP ON ITS OWN OR IF I PARK AND LEAVE IT FOR 30+ MINUTES. DEFINITELY SEEMS HEAT RELATED AND DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE WINTER. DESPITE THE \"SLOP\" IN THE PEDAL, THE CLUTCH APPEARS TO BE SHIFTING OK AND ENGAGES ABOUT MID PEDAL TRAVEL.     LAST MONTH NEW SYMPTOM APPEARED. TWICE, ONCE AFTER IT WAS SITTING AT WORK ALL DAY AND ANOTHER TIME AFTER RETURNING FROM A 3 HOUR CONCERT, THE CLUTCH PEDAL WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. I LITERALLY HAD TO STAND ON IT TO GET CAR INTO GEAR. ONCE, MOVING, IT RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION AFTER A COUPLE OF MILES OF DRIVING.     ORIGINALLY TOOK IT TO THE NISSAN DEALER, BUT THEY COULD NEVER REPRODUCE THE SYMPTOMS. AT 30K, NISSAN MECHANIC SAID IT NEEDED A NEW CLUTCH WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT.     WHEN TO LOCAL SHOP. THEY REPLACED THE MASTER AND SLAVE CYLINDER AND EQUALIZATION VALVE WITHOUT ANY IMPROVEMENT. THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE SYMPTOMS EITHER. TWO WEEKS AGO, AT 60K, I HAD THEM REPLACE THE CLUTCH, PRESSURE PLATE, THROWOUT BEARING AND FLYWHEEL ASSEMBLY. THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR SYMPTOM HAS NOT RETURNED (YET) BUT THE CLUTCH PEDAL PROBLEM IS STILL THERE.     NOW I HAVE A NEW PROBLEM WHICH ONLY STARTED AFTER THEY DID THIS LATEST WORK. THE STICK IS NOW POPPING OUT OF GEAR WHICH DRIVING. TWICE IN 6TH, BUT PREDOMINATELY IN 5TH. I LEFT THE CAR WITH THE MECHANIC FOR A DAY AND THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO HAPPEN. THEY CHECKED THE LINKAGE AND BUSHINGS AND THEY SAY EVERYTHING LOOKS OK. I WENT FOR A DRIVE WITH THEM AND OF COURSE IT DID NOT DO IT, UNTIL TONIGHT.  *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 1-800- NISSAN-1 AND REPORTED THIS TO CUSTOMER CARE REP. CHRISTINE BASILLE X. 51276, AND TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  FURTHERMORE, I TOLD HER THAT I HAD RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE ABOUT THE SKYVIEW WITH MY VIN SOME YEARS EARLIER, BACK IN 2004.  I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT NISSAN WHETHER I HAD EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT OR NOT.  I TOLD HER THAT IN 2004, I HAD TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER IN RESPONSE TO THE RECALL BACK THEN. THE DEALER HAD KEPT MY VEHICLE OVERNIGHT TO INSPECT IT, BUT CHOSE NOT TO REPLACE MY SKYVIEW SAYING SOMETHING LIKE MY VEHICLE DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE AFFECTED.  CHRISTINE BASILLE TOLD ME THAT A REPRESENTATIVE WOULD GET BACK IN CONTACT WITH ME BY MONDAY. IN THE INTERIM, I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ASSESSMENT, BECAUSE MY SERVICE REP SAID THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WARRANTY ISSUE AND DAMAGE DUE TO IMPACT. ALTHOUGH, THE SERVICE DEPT. REPORTED THAT THERE IS NO SIGN OF IMPACT, THEY HAVE DECLINED COVERING THE REPAIR. I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM MY REGIONAL NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE.",

THIS REPLACEMENT OCCURRED ON OCTOBER 6, 2006 WITH ONLY 11,000 MILES ON THE TIRES. I WAS VERY HESITANT TO DRIVE THE CAR DUE TO THE TIRE PRESSURE. I WAS FILLING THE TIRES EVERY TWO-THREE DAYS TO MAINTAIN SOME TYPE OF SAFETY WHILE DRIVING.    WHEN I APPLIED FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT ON THE GOODYEAR EAGLE RS-A TIRES MY CLAIM WAS DENIED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE REPLACEMENT WAS DUE TO 'A SIDEWALL ISSUE.'     WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD WILLINGLY CHOOSE TO REPLACE 4 TIRES AT ONCE WITH BRAND NEW TIRES AT ONLY 11,000 MILES IF THERE WAS NO SAFETY ISSUE??? OF COURSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND I WASN'T WILLING TO BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT TO PROVE THE POINT.     THE FOLLOWING IS A WEBSITE (JUST ONE OF MANY) THAT NOTES THE ISSUES AND LACK OF COMPANY RESPONSE.   WWW.CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/TIRES/GOODYEAR_TIRES.HTML.   CLEARLY THE COMPANY IS NOT CORRECTING OR REIMBURSING CONSUMERS FOR THEIR FAULTY PRODUCTS.    I SPENT WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY TO MAKE MY 'DREAM' CAR SAFE TO DRIVE. \\  *JB",

I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE TIRES, HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE IN THE SHOP FOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMING NUMEROUS TIMES; HAVE PAID TO HAVE THE BATTERY REPLACED BECAUSE THE CAR SUDDENLY STALLED; HAVE HAD THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TRIPS TO THE DEALER.  MOST RECENTLY, I REPLACED THE FRONT AND BACK BRAKES DUE TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  A MONTH LATER, THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM FAILS, AND I AM TOLD THAT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE CHARGE WILL BE $1,645.  THE CAR IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD.  I AM AT THE DEALER AT LEAST ONCE, SOMETIMES TWICE A MONTH.  I USED TO BE THE BIGGEST CHEERLEADER FOR NISSAN.  I HAD A 1991 NISSAN MAXIMA THAT I BOUGHT USED WITH 173,000 MILES ON IT.  THAT CAR WAS ON THE ROAD UNTIL IT HAD MORE THAN 300,000.  NOW I FEEL LIKE I PURCHASED A LEMON.  I BOUGHT A NEW CAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT THE HEADACHES THAT COME ALONG WITH A USED CAR.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER ON SEPTEMBER 18TH BECAUSE SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON WITH THE BRAKES.  I HAD HAD THE BRAKES CHANGED ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THAT, I KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN GOOD CONDITION.  I RECEIVED A CALL LATER THAT DAY TELLING ME THAT MY ABS BRAKE SYSTEM WAS BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO COVER THE COST BECAUSE THE PART WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. I CONTACT NISSAN NORTH AMERICA TO LODGE A COMPLAINT ON SEPTEMBER 19TH TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER THE COST FOR THE ABS SYSTEM FAILING, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO COVER A MAJOR REPAIR LIKE THAT ON A 2 YEAR OLD CAR.   I WAS TOLD THAT A REGIONAL SPECIALIST WOULD CALL ME BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS.  2 DAYS PASSED WITHOUT A RETURN CALL.  I CALLED AGAIN ON THE 22, AND AGAIN ON THE 25TH WITH NO RESPONSE.  L BELIEVE THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF ALL OF THE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS WITH THE MAXIMA AND BY NOT RESPONDING HOPE THAT CONSUMERS WILL GO AHEAD AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE CAR.   *NM",

SO WHEN I TURNED THE CAR ON, MY STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT MOVE TO ME, IT WAS STUCK IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION.  WHEN I TRIED TO MANUALLY MOVE TO DOWN AND CLOSER TO ME SO I CAN DRIVE THE CAR, IT WOULD NOT BUDGE.  THE STEERING WHEEL WAS STUCK UPRIGHT LIKE A BUS DRIVER'S STEERING WHEEL.  I HAD NOT CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP LIKE THAT.  IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRIVING LIKE THAT, SINCE IT WAS VERY HARD TO TURN THE WHEEL, CONSIDERING HOW HIGH IT WAS AND CLOSE TO THE WINDSHIELD IT WAS.  HUNTINGTON, NY DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE PART TO FIX THE STEERING WHEEL, AGAIN A ELECTRONIC PROBLEM.  I DID NOT HAVE MY CAR FOR A FEW DAYS.  I HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER COMPLAINT TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE, WHICH BY THE WAY, DOES NOTHING.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THIS DEALERSHIP TREATS CUSTOMERS LIKE GARBAGE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE WOMAN.   ALSO, STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM, EVERY NOW AND THEN WHEN I REVERSE, MY TRUNK POPS OPEN.  *NM",

ALL THIS MONEY CUSTOMERS SPEND ON THIS CAR AND THE SERVICE WORKERS AND MANAGERS AT BOTH HABBERSTAD AND SMITHTOWN ARE RUDE & OBNOXIOUS.  CORP TOLD ME TO TRY ANOTHER DEALERSHIP!

ONCE HOME, WE CHECKED THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RECALL ISSUED. WE WERE HORRIFIED TO FIND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM OWNERS OF 2004 NISSAN MAXIMAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  WE FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT PRESTIGIOUS COMPANIES SUCH AS GOODYEAR OR NISSAN WOULD BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE AS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO UNKNOWINGLY DRIVE AROUND ON HAZARDOUS TIRES. WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT OTHER NISSAN MAXIMA OWNERS MAY EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEM BUT MAY BE HURT OR KILLED AS A RESULT.  IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE OF BOTH GOODYEAR AND NISSAN TO NOT RESPOND TO THIS SITUATION.  WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL OR SAFETY ALERT AND FULLY REIMBURSE THE OWNERS FOR THE TIRE COST. WE THEN SENT LETTERS TO BOTH GOODYEAR AND NISSAN TO ADDRESS THEIR INTENT. *JB",

THIS WAS WHEN THE CAR HAD ONLY ABOUT 26,000 MILES.  HE SAID THE COST TO REPLACE THE TIRES IS $245 EACH TIRE, PLUS INSTALLATION COSTS.

IN MAY, 2005, MY FRONT DRIVER TIRE WAS LOW. I DROVE A HALF MILE AT 20 MPH TO THE CLOSEST GAS STATION AND FILLED THE TIRE. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO INVESTIGATE WHY IT WAS LOW. THEY NOTED THAT THE RIM WAS CRACKED, SAID IT WAS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THAT WAY, AND PUT THE \"DONUT\" SPARE ON IN PLACE OF THE CRACKED RIM. BESIDES THE CRACKED RIM BEING A SAFETY ISSUE (THE DEALER SAYS THAT I \"MUST HAVE HIT SOMETHING\", AND CLAIMS TO HAVE NO WARRANTY LIABILITY), I BELIEVE THE WHEEL/TIRE DESIGN OF THE 2004 MAXIMA IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 32 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH A RIM ON A CAR. NOW IN THE SPACE OF A MONTH OR TWO, I HAD A DENTED RIM THAT STRANDED ME IN A REMOTE AREA UNTIL I COULD CHANGE THE TIRE, AND NOW A CRACKED RIM THAT I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY REMOVE FROM THE CAR. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS BECAUSE THE RIM IS ALUMINUM AND PERHAPS BRITTLE AND NOT STURDY, OR BECAUSE LOW PROFILE TIRES LEAVE RELATIVELY LITTLE TIRE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND THE RIM, MAKING \"EVERYDAY POTHOLES\" THAT ARE COMMON IN THE NORTHEAST IN THE SPRINGTIME A HAZARD TO THE WHEELS (\"RIMS\"). BUT AFTER HAVING TWO RIMS THAT FAILED JUST A MONTH OR TWO APART SUCH THAT THEY EACH HAD TO BE TOTALLY REPLACED, I BELIEVE THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THIS CAR THAT LENDS ITSELF TO THESE SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT I EXPERIENCED WITH MY CAR. I OPENED A COMPLAINT ON THIS ISSUE WITH NISSAN, FILE #4947551. I WAS GIVEN NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN, EXCEPT THAT THEY WOULD \"LOOK AT THIS\", AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT EVEN SEND ME ANY RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT TO LET ME KNOW THEIR DECISION AS TO WHAT THEY DO OR DON'T PLAN TO DO REGARDING MY ISSUE.",

DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING A DEFECT WITH THE ROTORS, STRUTS, OR BRAKE PADS.. THE BRAKE PADS WERE ALSO REPLACED AFTER I INSISTED THAT THEY WERE REPLACED.  THE DEALERSHIP CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THE ROTORS GET HOT AND CAN WARP WHEN YOU HIT WATER ON THE ROAD, SURELY THE ROTORS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED AFTER A YEAR OF NORMAL WEAR.
