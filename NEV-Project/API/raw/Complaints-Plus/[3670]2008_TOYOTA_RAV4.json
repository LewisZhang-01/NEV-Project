I did not attempt to drive the car after this incident. I had it towed to Toyota Service. I was told that the steering bracket had come loose and that they had never seen anything like it before. I did some online research and found that this has happened many times with 2006, 2007 and 2008 Toyota RAV 4 vehicles. I believe there are even case numbers for some of them. It was determined to be a failed weld each time! If this had happened to me over the summer,  when I was driving in the mountains it cold have caused a serious or even fatal accident. I don't understand why this hasn't been recalled?! This is very dangerous for the unsuspecting people driving RAV 4s! The repair estimate for this is over $5,000!",

ON OCTOBER 8, 2015, WHILE I WAS DRIVING MY CAR BACK FROM STANFORD LUCILE PACKARD OVER DUMBARTON BRIDGE, I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY BRAKES WOULD NOT ENGAGE AND I COULD NOT SLOW DOWN MY CAR. JUST BEFORE THIS EVENT, THE ABS, VSC, AND SLIP WARNING LIGHTS ALL CAME ON. THE BRAKE PEDAL FELT VERY STIFF AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO ANY REPETITIVE PUMPING OF THE BRAKE.  I CALLED 911 AND REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. WHEN THE FRONT TRAFFIC CAME TO A HOLD I HAD TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE AND MY ENTIRE CAR SLIPPED TO THE LEFT. WE ALMOST GOT HIT BY THE BUS BEHIND US. SOME GOOD SAMARITANS SAW WHAT HAPPENED AND HELPED ME TO GET MY CAR OFF THE ROAD.   THAT DAY, MY 9 YRS. OLD SON AND I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I REQUEST THAT TOYOTA INVESTIGATES/RECALLS THE BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLIES FOR TOYOTA RAV4 2008.  IN THE SUBJECT VEHICLES, THE BRAKE SYSTEM CONTAINS A BRAKE ACTUATOR THAT ADJUSTS THE FLUID PRESSURE OF EACH WHEEL CYLINDER. WITHIN THE ACTUATOR IS AN ELECTRICAL TERMINAL THAT CONNECTS THE BRAKE ACTUATOR MOTOR AND THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE SKID CONTROL ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNIT (ECU). DUE TO MANUFACTURING VARIATION, THERE COULD BE A REDUCTION IN CONTACT FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE TERMINAL, CAUSING OXIDE FILM TO INCREASE RESISTANCE. A LARGER THAN NORMAL INCREASE IN RESISTANCE CAN CAUSE THE ILLUMINATION OF VARIOUS WARNING LIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE SKID CONTROL (VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL OR VSC) SYSTEM, ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS), AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM. LFTHIS OCCURS, THESE SYSTEMS COULD BECOME INOPERATIVE, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH.",

THEY \"CHECKED IT\", CHANGED THE OIL, AND SENT US ON OUR WAY TELLING US TO MONITOR THE OIL LEVEL.  THIS WAS AT 68K MILES.  IT WAS NEXT DUE FOR AN OIL CHANGE AT 73,000MILES I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL YESTERDAY AT 71,000 MILES AND IT WAS NEARLY EMPTY.  CALLED THE DEALER AGAIN, WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T GET ME IN FOR 10 DAYS!!  I CALLED ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER WHO TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN.    THE SERVICE MGR ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH \"CERTAIN RAV 4 ENGINES\" AND THAT A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED TO REPAIR THE ISSUE (NOT A RECALL-HE MADE THAT CLEAR).  HE EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THEIR PROCEDURE BEFORE IT CAN BE REPAIRED THOUGH BY DOING TWO OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS (THAT I HAVE TO PAY $24.95 FOR, AND DRIVE 1200 MILES EACH) THEN I WOULD HAVE TO AUTHORIZE THEM TO DO AN ENGINE REMOVAL AND DISASSEMBLY FOR $575 TO DETERMINE IT IS NOT SOMETHING I HAD DONE TO THE CAR.    I HAVE BABIED THIS VEHICLE FROM DAY ONE!  I NEVER GO BEYOND 4000 MILES FOR AN OIL CHANGE, EVER.  NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE MY FAMILY AROUND IN A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS VEHICLE WHILE THEY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO REPAIR THE ENGINE THAT THEY HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH FOR YEARS!!  UNACCEPTABLE!    THIS IS TERRIFYING KNOWING THAT MY ENGINE COULD SEIZE AT ANY MOMENT WHILE I AM ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING WITH MY CHILD.  IT IS EQUALLY AS FRIGHTENING TO REALIZE THAT I MAY END UP HAVING TO PAY $6000+ FOR A NEW ENGINE FOR THIS PIECE OF DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE I AM STILL PAYING FOR BECAUSE TOYOTA BELIEVES THEY ARE ABOVE THE LAW.

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2010, I START NOTICING THAT THE OIL LEVEL IS GETTING LOWER EVERY TIME BEFORE THE OIL CHANGE. I THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO SOME LEAK. THE DEALER SAID THERE ARE NO LEAKS IN THE ENGINE OIL AND THE OIL CONSUMPTION RATE IS ACCEPTABLE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD BE, BUT THEY ARGUED THAT IT IS STATED IN THE OWNER MANUAL.   IT GOT WORSE BY TIME, NOW I HAVE TO ADD A FULL QUART OR MORE BETWEEN OIL CHANGES JUST TO AVOID ENGINE DAMAGE. I OWNED MANY CARS BEFORE, OLDER MODELS, NONE OF THEM REQUIRED ADDING OIL BEFORE THE NEXT OIL CHANGE.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE MATTER, I FOUND THAT IT IS NOT ONLY MY CAR. TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT DOES NOT WANT TO FIX IT. I EVEN FOUND A DOCUMENT WITH VIN'S OF THE CARS AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE TSB-0094-11 (PISTON RING?)  CONSUMING THAT MUCH OIL IS NOT NORMAL, AND I BELIEVE WILL SHORTEN THE ENGINE'S LIFE AND IS REALLY BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.   I BOUGHT THE CAR BECAUSE OF IT'S REPUTATION OF BEING DEPENDABLE AND IT HAS A BIG NAME BEHIND IT. I HOPE SOMEONE ASK TOYOTA TO STEP UP AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

FOLLOWING OWNERS MANUAL, MY WIFE CALLED THE NEAREST TOYOTA DEALER WHO TOLD HER TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALER IMMEDIATELY, AND TO DRIVE CAUTIOUSLY, TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL ROOM WHEN FOLLOWING OTHER VEHICLES, AND NOT TO ATTEMPT SUDDEN STOPS. ANOTHER FAULT INDICATOR (CRUISE CONTROL WOULD NOT ENGAGE) PRESENTED ITSELF ENROUTE. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID THE REASON FOR ALL 4 FAULT INDICATIONS WAS THE #6 CYLINDER MISFIRED 1 TIME A FEW SECONDS AFTER I STARTED THE VEHICLE. HE SAID THE ECM IS PROGRAMMED TO GIVE THESE 4 FAULT INDICATIONS FOR A CYLINDER MISFIRE, BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHY. HE SAID THAT HE COULD FIND NO REASON FOR THE SINGLE MISFIRE, BUT THAT HE FOUND AND TIGHTENED A SLIGHTLY LOOSE AIR INTAKE HOSE THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE CAUSED THE MISFIRE. HE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE FOR ME TO MAKE MY INTERSTATE DRIVE WITHOUT COMING TO THE DEALERSHIP. I BELIEVE THAT THE ONBOARD COMPUTER PROGRAMMING THAT PROVIDED THESE 4 FAULT INDICATIONS IS DEFECTIVE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. 1. A SINGLE CYLINDER MISFIRE IS UNRELATED TO AND HAS NO EFFECT UPON THE THREE SYSTEMS POINTED TO BY THE FAULT INDICATIONS (VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL, 4 WHEEL DRIVE, CRUISE CONTROL) 2. A SINGLE CYLINDER MISFIRE AT STARTUP IS NOT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION REQUIRING IMMEDIATE SERVICE AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WITH EXTRAORDINARILY CAUTIOUS DRIVING ENROUTE. 3. DURING THE 1 HOUR DRIVE TO THE DEALERSHIP THE CYLINDERS OF THE VEHICLE FIRED SUCCESSFULLY AROUND 360,000 TIMES, AND THE PROGRAMMING DID NOT RECOGNIZE THIS FAULTLESS OPERATION AND AUTOMATICALLY CLEAR THE FAULT INDICATORS.",

WHEN I BROUGHT IT INTO A SERVICE STATION THEY SAID I HAD NO OIL.  I HAVE SINCE BROUGHT IT BACK TO MY DEALER A FEW TIMES FOR THE LIGHT COMING ON AND BEING OUT OF OIL. I HAVE ALREADY DONE THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST BACK IN MAY BUT TOYOTA FELT THAT IT WAS NORMAL FOR MY CAR TO HAVE LOST OIL IN 1569 MILES (PER THE OWNERS MANUAL).  I JUST HAD IT BACK AT THE DEALER BECAUSE AFTER DRIVING ONLY 3,200 MILES SINCE MY LAST OIL CHANGE, MY OIL LIGHT FLICKED ON AGAIN. WHEN I CHECKED IT THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE VEHICLE.  I KNOW THERE IS A TSB OUT FOR THIS ISSUE WITH MY CAR, AND SEVERAL OTHER MODELS OF TOYOTA, BUT SINCE I DON'T HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE THE DEALER/SERVICE DEPT TOLD ME TO CONTACT TOYOTA DIRECTLY.  TOYOTA DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE AND CONTINUED TO QUOTE ME PAGE 314 OF THE OWNERS MANUAL AND THE OIL CONSUMPTION CRITERIA ON THE PAGE.  FOR SOME REASON THEY COULD NOT SEE THE NOTES FROM MY DEALER FROM EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT I HAD RUN OUT OF OIL AFTER 3,200 MILES.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ACTUALLY SAID TO ME \"WHAT IS IT YOU WANT US TO DO?\"  I TOLD HIM I WANT YOU TO FIX MY CAR THAT YOU KNOW HAS A PROBLEM AS DESCRIBED IN THE TSB.  I WAS TOLD TO ONCE AGAIN DO THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WITH MY DEALER.  I AGREE WITH OTHERS, IF MY CAR IS SET TO GO 5000 MILES WITHOUT AN OIL CHANGE, BUT I ONLY WENT 3200 AND HAD NO OIL, HOW CAN THEY NOT RECALL THE VEHICLE OR BE FORCED TO FIX THIS KNOWN ISSUE?!!  TOYOTA, I FEEL, IS JEOPARDIZING MINE AND MY FAMILY'S SAFETY BY NOT CORRECTING THIS ISSUE.  WHAT DISTURBS ME GREATLY IS THAT THE LIGHT DOESN'T COME ON AND STAY ON, IT FLICKS ON WHEN YOU ARE BREAKING SO IF YOU MISS IT, YOU WILL NOT KNOW YOU ARE OUT OF OIL.  A RECALL IS IN ORDER AND I HOPE IT OCCURS BEFORE MY ENGINE IS BLOWN!!  *TR",

AFTER COMPLAINING TO THE DEALER, THEY OFFERED TO PAY FOR THE PART (APPROX. $275.00) AND WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LABOR CHARGE ($109.00) THE SERVICE AND DEALERSHIP MANAGERS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS A KNOWN ISSUE ALTHOUGH MANY CAR FORUMS ARE RIFE WITH COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE.

I HAD MY DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW DOWN (POWER WINDOWS) AND INITIALLY ATTRIBUTED THE ODOR TO A LARGE TRUCK THAT WAS SEVERAL CAR LENGTHS AHEAD OF ME.  I NOTICED THAT THE ODOR PERSISTED EVEN ONCE THE TRUCK WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE TO ME OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.  AT THAT POINT I THEN ENTERED ONTO A MAJOR HIGHWAY VIA THE ENTRANCE RAMP, AND GOT MY SPEED UP TO THE SPEED LIMIT OF 65 MILES PER HOUR.  AS I WAS DRIVING I NOTICED A LARGE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING UP FROM MY POWER WINDOW SWITCHES ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  IN ADDITION TO THE SMOKE I COULD SEE AN ACTUAL FLAME BURNING UNDERNEATH THE SWITCHES.  MY INITIAL RESPONSE WAS FEAR AND PANIC, BUT I WAS ABLE TO FIND A SAFE SPOT TO PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES.  MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DIAL 911, BUT I WAS AFRAID BY THE TIME SOMEONE ARRIVED THE CAR MIGHT BURST INTO FLAMES AND BLOW UP!! I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED TO TRY TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE SOMEHOW AS MY CAR WAS FILLING WITH SMOKE AND THE ODOR WAS OVERWHELMING.  I QUICKLY LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF I HAD ANY BOTTLED WATER IN THE CAR-BUT I DID NOT.  THE ONLY LIQUID I HAD ACCESSIBLE TO DOWSE THE FLAMES WAS MY ICED COFFEE-SO I POURED A SMALL AMOUNT OVER THE SMOKE AND FLAMES COMING FROM THE SWITCHES TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE, BUT IT CONTINUED TO BURN.  I THEN PROCEEDED TO POUR HALF OF MY ICED COFFEE OVER THE SWITCHES WHICH DID FINALLY EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE THE ONLY WINDOW THAT WILL ACTUALLY MOVE NOW IS THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW.  THE PASSENGER'S WINDOW WILL NOT MOVE AT ALL AND THE TWO REAR WINDOWS WILL ONLY MOVE IF USING THE SWITCHES ON THE BACK DOORS.  AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE MY CAR NOW HAS A VERY DISTINGUISHABLE BURNT ODOR TO IT!  NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS WAS ONE OF THE SCARIEST EXPERIENCES I HAVE HAD WHEN DRIVING MY CAR.  *TR",

IT WAS A SUNDAY, SO I ENDED UP GETTING THE CAR DROPPED OFF AT GOODYEAR IN CEDAR CITY, SINCE I WOULD NEED AN ALIGNMENT AFTER THE NEW TIE ROD WAS PUT IN.

IT HAD AROUND 23,300 MILES ON IT AT TIME OF PURCHASE.      THAT NIGHT OF 02/21, I CHECKED CONSUMER REPORTS ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON 2008  TOYOTA RAV4.   THE NEXT MORNING, I REMOVED THE FLOOR MAT FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE FLOOR.  IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MOVED BEFORE.  THERE ARE 2 HOLES AT THE BACK OF THE MAT AND ONE OF THE HOLES HAD A BLACK RUBBER HOOK DEVICE HOLDING IT TO THE FLOOR.  THE OTHER HOLE (BACK RIGHT SIDE) DID NOT HAVE A HOOK.   WHEN I ENTERED THE VIN ON THE TOYOTA  WEBSITE, IT SHOWED A REPAIR ORDER FOR A CAR WITH 30,599 MILES ON 11/08/2012.  MY CAR STILL DOES NOT HAVE THAT MANY MILES.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS ITS FRUSTRATING AND SCARY, I'M THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW FROM MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. I LIVE IN WISCONSIN AND THE SNOW IS COMING AND TOYOTA REQUIRE ME TO LEAVE THE CAR WITH THEM FOR OVER A WEEK OR SO, NOT A PROBLEM CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE IT UNTIL ITS FIX. ITS NOW AFTER THANKSGIVING AND THE PROBLEM IS STILL OCCURRING I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY BUT THEY WONT EVEN LOOK AT IT UNTIL I LEAVE IT WITH THEM FOR A WEEK. I CANT LEAVE IT THERE BECAUSE I NEED A CAR FOR WORK SO I HAD TO ARRANGE CAR RENTALS FIRST WITH MY OWN EXPENSE AND WILL BE DROPPING THE CAR OFF SATURDAY. THE ANSWERS THEY ALREADY GAVE ME WAS NO CLUE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT WITH NO CHECK  ENGINE CODE. I DON'T WANT TO BE ANOTHER KOUA FONG LEE.

THE FIRST TIME, TOYOTA CLAIMED THAT THE NON-BRAKING/UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY FLOOR MATS I PUT IN THE CAR. I BOUGHT THESE FOR THE CAR BECAUSE I FELT THE ONES TOYOTA ORIGINALLY PROVIDED WERE NOT SAFE (HEELS ON MY SHOES, THOUGH FLAT, KEPT GETTING CAUGHT IN THE DEEP RIDGES OF THEIR MATS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER). AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE TOYOTA 'S MECHANICS,  I THREW OUT MY MATS AND REPLACED THEM WITH NEW TOYOTA MATS RECOMMENDED BY THE DEALERSHIP. ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. WHEN I APPLIED MY FOOT TO THE BRAKE, INSTEAD OF THIS ACTION STOPPING THE CAR, THE CAR ACCELERATED AND MOVED FORWARD. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, MY CAR WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN AT THE BOTTOM OF A HILL LEADING TO MY COMPLEX'S EXIT. AS I NEARED THE STOP SIGN IN FRONT OF A VERY BUSY ROADWAY, I STARTED APPLYING MY BRAKES. THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN. ALTHOUGH I PUSHED DOWN HARDER & HARDER ON THE BRAKE IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO STOP THE CAR, IT CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD. MY RAV4 WENT ONTO THE ROADWAY, NARROWLY MISSING A TRUCK IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE SECOND TIME I WAS IN A PARKING LOT. I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY WRONG WITH THIS CAR AND DO NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE SAFE. THE MECHANIC AT TOYOTA, BEFORE EVEN EXAMINING THE CAR, CLAIMED IT WAS \"HUMAN ERROR.\" I HAVE DRIVEN MANY CARS IN MY LIFETIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE. IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THE NHTSA & DOT WILL LOOK INTO THIS AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS.  IT APPEARS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HAVING BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THESE CARS.

I HAD FLOORED THE GAS PEDAL SINCE I WAS GOING UPHILL AND PASSING, BUT WHEN I EASED MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL REMAINED PRESSED TO THE FLOOR.  I HAD ENTERED A SINGLE LANE CONSTRUCTION ZONE AND WAS ACCELERATING RAPIDLY.  I STOMPED ON THE ACCELERATOR HOPING TO SPRING IT LOOSE AND TRIED THE BRAKES, TO NO AVAIL.  AS I WAS REACHING SPEEDS WELL INTO THE 90'S AND WITHIN SECONDS OF PLOWING INTO THE TRAFFIC AHEAD OF ME I REACHED DOWN AND GRABBED THE GAS PEDAL AND PULLED UP ON IT.  IT DID COME UP THEN AND I WAS ABLE TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN IN TIME TO AVOID CRASHING.  I WAS TERRIFIED AND THOUGHT I WOULD DIE.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WE HAD PURCHASED IT FROM AND THEY INSISTED IT WAS CAUSED BY MY FLOOR MAT AND THAT IT WAS MY FAULT SINCE IT WAS NOT A TOYOTA FLOOR MAT.  I TOLD THEM THERE WAS NOTHING OBSTRUCTING THE PEDAL WHEN I REACHED DOWN FOR IT, IT WAS SIMPLY STUCK.  THEY CONTINUE TO BLAME THE FLOOR MAT, MY CAR HAS NOT BEEN PUT ON THE RECALL LIST AND IT SCARES ME EVERY DAY TO DRIVE IT.  I NEVER, EVER FLOOR IT AND NOW KNOW TO PUT IT IN NEUTRAL SHOULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN---ALTHOUGH I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE CRASHED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET THE CAR IN NEUTRAL.  I AM VERY UPSET THAT TOYOTA BLAMESHIFTS AND DODGES THE ISSUE BY BLAMING THE MATS AND REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THEIR RECALL HOTLINE TOLD ME IT IS MY PROBLEM SINCE MY CAR IS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST.  I DID BUY THEIR MAT AFTER THE INCIDENT, ONLY TO BE TOLD LATER THAT I SHOULD REMOVE IT SINCE IT COULD CAUSE ACCELERATOR ENTRAPMENT.  MY DEALER STILL BLAMES THE WHOLE PROBLEM ON MY NON COMPLIANT MAT EVEN THOUGH THEY RECALLED THEIR OWN MATS, TOO.  IT IS VERY DISTURBING TO FIND OUT THAT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO SO MANY OTHERS AND GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME.  SO MANY DEATHS AND ACCIDENTS, AND I EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN ONE.  WE HAVE BOUGHT 5 TOYOTAS FROM THIS DEALER AND HAVE HAD NO SUPPORT AND HAVE BEEN TREATED RUDELY. *TR",

I REPORTED IT THEN AND THE FIRST SEVERAL TIMES IT WENT IN FOR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.  THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE SAME - THAT'S JUST WHAT TOYOTAS DO.     THE PROBLEM - WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN IDLING, THE CAR HESITATES.  THERE IS A SECOND OR 2 DURING WHICH THERE IS NO POWER.  THEN, THE POWER KICKS IN AND THE CAR JUMPS FORWARD, NOT BECAUSE THE PEDAL IS STICKING BUT BECAUSE THE CAR SUDDENLY \"CATCHES UP\" WITH THE GAS PEDAL.    THE EXPLANATION GIVEN BY TWO DEALERS IS THIS:  IN THE TOYOTA, THERE IS A DELAY BETWEEN WHEN THE PEDAL IS PRESSED DOWN AND WHEN THE CAR'S COMPUTER SENDS THE INFORMATION TO THE CARBURETOR, OR WHATEVER PASSES FOR IT IN NEW ENGINES.  THAT CAUSES THE SEQUENCE - PRESS THE GAS PEDAL, HESITATION, THEN SURGE.    THIS IS MOST DANGEROUS WHEN TRYING TO MERGE INTO HEAVY, FAST MOVING TRAFFIC.  OPENINGS IN THE TRAFFIC ARE USUALLY SMALL BUT ADEQUATE IF THE CAR RESPONDS.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE CAR HESITATES, THEN SURGES, THE OPENING CAN BE MISSED AND THE CAR AND DRIVER ARE AT RISK FOR A SIGNIFICANT ACCIDENT.      THE PROBLEM IS ALSO INTERMITTENT SO THAT THE DRIVER CAN BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD, EVEN WHEN EXPERIENCED WITH THE CAR.    I'M FILING THIS BECAUSE I SEE THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS GONE PAST THE STICKING PEDAL TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CARS.  SO I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE HELPFUL.    PS-I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT THE PROBLEM HAS NOT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE A LITTLE LUCK AND A QUICK FOOT TO THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS ALL THAT PREVENTED ONE.

I AM A DRIVER WHO FOR HEALTH REASONS WISHES TO SIT ERECT.  I AM NOT FAT, AND OF NORMAL HEIGHT (5'6\").  THIS LAST WEEKEND I PURCHASED A RAV4.  THE HEADRESTS INTRUDE INTOLERABLY INTO MY HEAD SPACE.  IN ORDER TO SIT AT MY PREFERRED ANGLE AND KEEP MY BACK TO THE SEATBACK, MY HEAD IS TILTED DOWN SO THAT I MUST RAISE MY EYES TO LOOK OVER MY EYEGLASSES, OR MY STRAIGHT VISION IS DIRECTED TO THE CENTER OF THE STEERING WHEEL. I TRUST THAT THESE HEADRESTS MEET YOUR STANDARDS.

MY PRESENT APPROACH TO BEING ABLE TO DRIVE THIS CAR IS TO TURN THE HEADREST BACKWARDS, AND I AM FULLY AWARE THAT THIS DEPRIVES ME OF THE NECK SAFETY I WOULD HAVE HAD FROM AN OLDER DESIGN OF HEADREST.    I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE COMMENTS IN SECTION  VII OF  RIN 2127-AH09, \"SPECIFICALLY, THEY MAINTAINED THAT SMALLER FEMALE OCCUPANTS TEND TO UTILIZE STEEPER SEAT BACK ANGLES. ACCORDING TO THESE COMMENTERS, A BACKSEAT OF 50 MM MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INTRUSIONS INTO THE SPACE WHERE THESE OCCUPANTS TYPICALLY PLACE THEIR HEADS, FORCING THEIR HEADS INTO AN UNNATURAL FORWARD-TILTING POSITION\"  IS DESCRIPTIVE OF MY SITUATION.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE NHTSA TO CONSIDER MINORITY AS WELL AS MAJORITY NEEDS IN DRAFTING SUCH REGULATIONS.
