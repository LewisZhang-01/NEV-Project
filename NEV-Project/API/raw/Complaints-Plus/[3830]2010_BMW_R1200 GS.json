IT IS A PLASTIC PART WHEN ALL PREVIOUS MODELS WERE METAL.  THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES ON MY BIKE SO FAR. THE INDIVIDUAL PART IS NOT AVAILABLE AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE TOTAL THROTTLE BODY $546 + $400 LABOR. THERE IS ALSO THE DANGER OF THE THROTTLE JAMMING WHILE IN OPERATION DUE TO THESE CRACKED AND BROKEN LOOSE PARTS. I WAS IN MOTION AND FELT THROTTLE STICK AND THEN RELEASE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TIMES WHILE I WAS IN THE HOV LANE ON THE FREEWAY. I HAVE REPAIR DOCUMENTATION ON FILE FOR ALL 3 REPLACED THROTTLE BODIES BUT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCAN THEM. IF YOU NEED COPIES PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WILL GET THEM SCANNED AT KINKOS AND SEND THEM TO YOU. THIS HAPPENED IN MAY AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK OF RESPONSE BMW HAS TO THIS ISSUE WHICH IS A MATERIAL DESIGN FLAW THAT COULD END UP HURTING A MOTORCYCLIST IF THE THROTTLE JAMS AT SPEED. I SEE FROM DIFFERENT WEB SITES THAT THIS IS HAPPENING  ON DIFFERENT BMW MODELS WITH THE SAME THROTTLE BODY. IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN THE MILEAGE IS ABOVE 40,000 MILES. PLEASE KEEP ME INFORMED ON WHAT THE SITUATION IS WITH THIS SINCE I AM WORRIED AND DON'T TRUST MY MOTORCYCLE NOW. I AM AN OLDER RIDER (75YRS) NOT SOME HOT SHOT THAT ABUSES MY MOTORCYCLE. I HAVE BEEN RIDING FOR OVER 45 YEARS AND THIS IS MY 4TH BMW. I DID TALK TO THE BMW REP WHO WAS AT MY LOCAL DEALER BUT TO NO AVAIL. ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU NEED OR ANYWAY I CAN HELP PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME. I AM CONCERNED FOR RIDERS OUT THERE WITH THIS THROTTLE AND WOULD LIKE IT ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT.

THERE IS A FALSE NEUTRAL BETWEEN 5TH AND 6TH GEAR.  WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER UNDER WARRANTY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THEY INDICATED THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPLICATED SO THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT.  THIS ISSUE IS DOCUMENTED ONLINE THAT OTHER BMW MOTORCYCLES HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR FREQUENTLY, BUT IS NOT SAFE WHEN IT GOES INTO NEUTRAL AT AROUND 60 MPH.  IT HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN SEPTEMBER 2014 AND IT NEARLY CAUSED ME TO CRASH WITH A CAR BEHIND ME WHEN THE BIKE WENT INTO NEUTRAL.  I BROUGHT IT TO ANOTHER DEALER AND HAVE REACHED OUT TO BMW OF NORTH AMERICA.  BMW NA IS REFUSING TO FIX THE ISSUE.  THIS IS A BIG SAFETY CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN OFFER.  *TR",
