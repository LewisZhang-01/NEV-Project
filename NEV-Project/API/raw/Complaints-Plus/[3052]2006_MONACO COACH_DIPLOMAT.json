THIS LEAK INVOLVED THE LINE FROM THE FUEL PUMP TO THE FUEL RAIL SPRAYING DIESEL FUEL ALL OVER THE ENGINE WHILE THE UNIT WAS RUNNING. MOTORHOME HAD TO BE TOWED 65 MILES TO BILLINGS, MT CUMMINS REPAIR FACILITY. A NEW FUEL LINE WAS INSTALLED, ALONG WITH A BRACKET WHICH IS NOW BEING INSTALLED ON THESE FAULTY LINES DUE TO THESE REPORTED FUEL LEAKS. NUMEROUS MOTORHOME OWNERS WITH THIS ENGINE HAVE REPORTED THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION TO BOTH CUMMINS AND VARIOUS COACH MANUFACTURERS. OWNERS ARE OF THE OPINION THAT A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED FOR THESE ENGINES DUE TO THE POTENTIAL OF A CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FIRE DUE TO THESE LEAKS. DRIVERS OF THESE UNITS WOULD NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF A FIRE ON THE COACH SINCE THE ENGINE IS AT THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  *TR",
