I PURCHASED MY USED 2007 FORD FOCUS FROM A BEASLEY FORD DEALERSHIP IN JUNE 2010.  NOT EVEN ONE YEAR AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN APRIL 2011, I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE AIRBAG LIGHT STARTED TO FLICKER. SHORTLY AFTER, IT JUST STAYED ON.  I NOTICED THAT THE CENTER DASH PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT, THE ONE THAT SENSES A SITTING PASSENGER, WAS ALSO FLICKERING FROM TIME TO TIME AND WOULD SPORADICALLY COME ON OR OFF. IN MAY 2010, I CALLED BEASLEY FORD AND THE WOMAN SAID THAT IT WOULD BE $88.00 TO DIAGNOSE THE AIRBAG LIGHT AND THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY FOR THIS MATTER. I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND DECIDED TO SPEND THE $88 DOLLARS TO HAVE THE AIRBAG LIGHT DIAGNOSED. I WAITED FOR AN HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES. I WAS CALLED TO THE SERVICE CENTER. THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT HE NEEDED ANOTHER TWO HOURS WITH MY CAR TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. HE HAD ALREADY SPENT ONE HOUR TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND HE WAS ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO 3-4 POSSIBLE CAUSES. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE ANOTHER $88.00 PER HOUR, TOTALING $167.00, JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE AIRBAG. I TOLD THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I CALLED AND THE WOMAN SAID IT WAS $88 DOLLARS AND NEVER TOLD ME IT WAS $88 DOLLARS PER HOUR. I WAS THEN TOLD THAT AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS, I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR PARTS, WHICH COULD BE UPWARDS OF $617.00 IF THE AIRBAG NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, PLUS LABOR.     FRUSTRATED AND COMPLETELY SHOCKED, I CAME HOME AND CHECKED TO SEE IF THE AIRBAG WAS AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR OTHER FORD FOCUS OWNERS. I READ ABOUT HUNDREDS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITHIN THE YEARS 2005-2007. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY I AM WRITING IS BECAUSE IF THIS ISSUE HASN'T BEEN LOOKED INTO, I THINK IT SHOULD BE.    *TR",

I MADE IT TO WORK FINE, AND EVEN CHECKED ON IT DURING MY LUNCH HOUR--IT STARTED UP FINE, LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING WAS WORKING, WITH NO INDICATOR LIGHTS ILLUMINATING ON THE DASH.  THINKING IT WAS FINE, I DROVE HOME THAT NIGHT WITH THE INTENTION OF BRINGING IT TO THE SHOP TO CHECK THE BATTERY OVER THE WEEKEND.  WHILE DRIVING HOME (IN THE DARK) THAT EVENING, I MADE IT ALMOST TO MY APARTMENT.  I NOTICED AGAIN THAT MY RADIO SUDDENLY STOPPED PLAYING.  I LOOKED AT THE RADIO, AT WHICH POINT I SAW THE TEXT DISPLAY \"LOW BATTERY.\"  I BEGAN TO NOTICE EVERYTHING DIMMING--THE DASHBOARD, INTERIOR LIGHTS, AND EVEN MY HEADLIGHTS.  I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO GET TO MY APARTMENT OK.   THE NEXT MORNING I HAD AN APPOINTMENT TO GET TO THE SHOP.  AFTER READING THE OTHER COMPLAINTS OF SIMILAR DRIVERS OF 2007 FORD FOCUSES HAVING IDENTICAL ISSUES, I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT DRIVING TO THE SHOP.

LUCKILY MY CAR MADE IT THE 3.1 MILES TO THE SHOP, BEFORE GIVING OUT.  SAME THING--NO EARLIER INDICATIONS THAT THE BATTERY WAS LOW, THE POWER JUST STARTS SHUTTING DOWN.

THE RADIO WENT BLACK, ALL LIGHTS AND GAUGES FOLLOWED. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT APPROX. 2 MILES TO A TRUCK STOP, BEFORE THE CAR DIED, AND I CALLED FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. AFTER REALIZING THAT IT'S PROBABLY THE ALTERNATOR, I DID A SEARCH ONLINE AND REALIZED THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE IN THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF CAR, AROUND THE SAME MILEAGE. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE BY FORD TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE AND I THINK THEY SHOULD. I WAS ON A BUSY HIGHWAY WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AND HER 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, WHO WAS TERRIFIED OF THE WHOLE SITUATION OF BEING STRANDED IN THE DARK AT NIGHT. I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT PEOPLE HAVE NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR IN THESE CARS MORE THAN ONE TIME, AFTER THE INITIAL EPISODE. I HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED AND IT COST ME $100. I HAVEN'T EVEN MADE MY FIRST MONTHLY PAYMENT ON THIS CAR YET !!!  NOW IM LOOKING AT SPENDING ANYWHERE FROM $400-$700 TO FIX A CAR THAT I PURCHASED, LESS THAN 3 WEEKS AGO. HAD THERE BEEN A RECALL FROM FORD ON THIS, I WOULD EITHER HAVE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IT, OR I COULD HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN WHEN I PURCHASED IT AND HAD IT SERVICED, FREE OF CHARGE. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT ON THE INTERNET TO CONSTITUTE A RECALL. I HOPE THIS HELPS IN GETTING THAT DONE.

        "summary": "I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS WITH DESIGN FLAWS IN MY 2007 FORD FOCUS SSE:    (1) .BECAUSE OF WHERE THE DOOR LOCK IS LOCATED, JUST ABOVE THE DOOR HANDLES (FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES) ALL THE DOORS WILL LOCK AT TIMES AND YOU DON'T REALIZE IT WHEN YOU OPEN, GET OUT,  THEN CLOSE THE DOOR.  MOST OFTEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE LEFT THE MOTOR RUNNING WITH THE KEY NOW LOCKED INSIDE.  THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE OF COMING IN CONTACT WITH THIS LOCK WITH YOUR FINGERS OR HAND WHILE OPENING THE DOOR WITH THE HANDLE. THIS HAS OCCURRED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DESPITE NOW KNOWING WHAT CAUSES THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A COMPLETE NUISANCE AND DANGEROUS IF CHILDREN WOULD HAPPEN TO BE LEFT IN THE CAR WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AND THE DOORS LOCKED AND NO SECOND KEY ON HAND.      (2). THE SECOND PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE AUTOMOBILE IS I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE \"AUDI EFFECT\" WHERE THE CAR ACCELERATES ON OCCASION WHEN BRAKING.  THIS I ALSO ASCRIBE TO A DESIGN FLAW: THE BRAKE PEDAL AND GAS PEDAL ARE PLACED TOO CLOSE TOGETHER AND AT A RELATIVE CLOSE HEIGHT TO ONE ANOTHER.   AFTER TAKING THE DEFENSIVE POSITION, IN A POTENTIAL BRAKING SITUATION, IF YOU HAVE TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE QUICKLY AND HARD, THE CAR ACCELERATES. THIS TAKES YOU COMPLETELY BY SUPRISE AND IT TAKES TIME TO RESPOND.   I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE SAME WAY FOR 45 YEARS, WITH MANY VEHICLES, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  LUCKILY THE CAR SAT MOST OF THE WINTER BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM I DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY AND NO ONE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE ON SNOW COVERED OR ICY ROADS.  I BROUGHT THIS UP AT  THE END OF APRIL IN A VISIT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD TO FILE A COMPLAINT BY SERVICE MANAGER STEVE LOVALVO.    I WANT TO BRING BOTH OF THESE DEFECTS TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I HAVE LEASED A LEMON THAT HAS PROBLEMS THAT CANNOT BE SERVICED BY THE DEALERSHIP AND PRESENTS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FOR MANY OTHER DRIVERS ALSO. *TR",

FINALLY, I BROUGHT IT TO FORD AND THEY FOUND A BENT CONTROL ARM IN THE FRONT R/S.  IN ADDITION, THEY FOUND A SLIPPED BELT ON THE L/R TIRE AND R/F TIRE HAD UNEVEN WEAR.  OK, SO HERE'S MY COMPLAINT....THERE IS NO WAY THAT I HIT ANYTHING SO HARD THAT I BENT MY CONTROL ARM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!  SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THIS I HAD TO LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR - ALMOST $400.00.  THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH THE TIRES.  SINCE THE REPAIR IN THE FRONT WAS THE SAME PLACE THAT THE TIRE HAD UNEVEN WEAR, I HAD TO EAT THIS ONE TOO - $125.00.  THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT ABOUT THIS SLIPPED BELT IN THE REAR TIRE?  I GUESS I WAS TO BLAME FOR THAT ONE TOO.  MAYBE THESE PIRELLI TIRES ARE THE PROBLEM.      I SHOULD HAVE READ THE COMPLAINTS HERE BEFORE I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO FORD.  FORD DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER TIRES THAT FIT THESE RIMS, BUT THE SAME PIRELLI'S THAT WERE ON THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.  SINCE THE CAR WAS ALREADY IN THE SHOP AND MY TIME IS LIMITED, I WAS STUCK GETTING THE SAME JUNK.  MY MESSAGE....DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE - DO NOT REPLACE THE TIRES ON YOUR FOCUS WITH THE PIRELLI'S THAT CAME WITH THE CAR.

BOTTOM LINE,  OCCUPANTS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT ( IN THIS CASE MY DAUGHTER OR WIFE) COULD BE SUBJECTED TO LETHAL INJURIES AS A RESULT ON NON DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIR BAG DUE TO A FAULTY MECHANISM WHICH INTERPRETS ERRONEOUSLY THAT SMALL ADULTS ARE CHILDREN EVEN IN THE CASE OF NORMAL SMALL ADULTS.
