AFTER IT STOPPED, THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY SHUT OFF AND COULD NOT GET STARTED. THEREAFTER ANOTHER CAR BROADSIDED THE CAR AND KNOCK IT TO THE CURB MOVING THE VEHICLE FORM THE \"T\" POSITION.  HER DAD CONTACTED MARIETTA CADILLAC DEALER A FEW DAYS LATER  AND INFORMED THEM OF THE SHUT-OFF AND ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS. THE DEALER SAID THEY WOULD CHECK AND CALL BACK. THERE WAS NO FURTHER RESPONSE FROM THE MARIETTA, CADILLAC DEALER.     IN AUGUST OF 2014 I CALLED GENERAL MOTOR (GM) AND INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE ACCIDENT, THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT COULD BE THE IGNITION SLIP-OF-THE-KEY TO ANOTHER POSITION CAUSING THE CAR TO SHUT OFF.      A CAROL FROM GM CALLED ME AND WENT OVER MY COMPLAINT, SHE LATER SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AND SAID THEY WOULD CHECK THE CAR THEN THEY WOULD LET US KNOW IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE IGNITION. CAROL TOLD ME TO LEAVE THE CTS AT THE CADILLAC DEALER IN MARIETTA WHERE AN INDEPENDENT PERSON WOULD CHECK IT.

THE CAR SHUT OFF ON A BUSY THROUGHWAY.

I THEN PARKED THE CAR AND OPENED THE HOOD TO LOOK AT THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR AND NOTICED IT WASN'T COMPLETELY FULL BUT THERE WAS STILL A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FLUID.  I THEN LOOKED AT THE GROUND AND NOTICED A LINE OF LIQUID THAT TRACED MY MOVEMENT BACKWARDS OUT OF THE PARKING SPOT AND THEN BACK INTO THE PARKING SPOT, THIS LIQUID WAS BRAKE FLUID.  IMAGINE MY SURPRISE AT HAVING A SECOND GM VEHICLE WITH A BRAKE LINE FAILURE 30 DAYS AFTER EXPERIENCING A BRAKE LINE FAILURE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY 40+ YEARS OF DRIVING AND OWNING VEHICLES.  THE FIRST WAS A 2001 TAHOE WHICH I REPORTED LAST MONTH TO NHTSA AND WHICH COST ME OVER $1,000 TO REPLACE ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES.  AFTER WORK THIS EVENING I EXAMINED THE CTS AND DISCOVERED EXTREME CORROSION IN THE TWO BRAKE LINES RUNNING FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER TO THE ABS UNIT IN THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE BAY. THE CORROSION IS WORST WHERE THE LINES RUN BEHIND THE RADIATOR AND IT APPEARS BOTH LINES HAVE FAILED.  THE LORD MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT AFTER ME BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I DROVE 37 MILES FROM BALTIMORE ON THE INTERSTATE.  HAD THE BRAKES FAILED THEN I IMAGINE I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A SPECTACULAR ACCIDENT ON I-95 THAT MAY HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE AS WELL AS OTHERS.   GM RECALLED THE CTS FOR BRAKE LINE CORROSION BY THE CALIPERS WHERE THE LINE CONNECTS INSIDE A RUBBER PIECE.  NHTSA IS INVESTIGATING BRAKE LINE CORROSION ON 1999 TO 2003 FULL SIZE GM TRUCKS AND PICKUPS AND I SUGGEST THE INVESTIGATION BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL GM VEHICLES OF THIS VINTAGE AS IT APPEARS GM USED AN INFERIOR GRADE OF STEEL IN THEIR BRAKE LINES IN ALL OF THE VEHICLES.  *TR",

I TOOK IT TO MIDAS THIS TIME AND THEY NOTICED A PROBLEM AND SAID MAYBE ITS A WHEEL BARRING. THEY REPLACED ISSUE DUPLICATED ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER. SINCE I DID NOT HAVE A SECOND CAR OR PAY FOR A RENTAL I HAD TO TAKE MY CAR HOME TO GO BACK TO WORK THE NEXT DAY. THIS PROBLEM IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND I HAVE EVEN BEEN PULLED OVER BECAUSE THE COP ASKED WHY I WAS SWERVING WHILE DRIVING. I TOLD THE OFFICE ITS THE CODE THAT COMES UP ON MY SCREEN AND IT MAKES MY CAR HALT WHILE DRIVING AND I CAN NOT CONTROL IT. HE STATED THAT ITS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND IF ANOTHER OFFICER WAS ON DUTY THEY MIGHT IMPOUND MY CAR DUE TO A SAFETY HAZARD BUT HE WOULD GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TAKE IT HOME TO GO TO THE SHOP.
