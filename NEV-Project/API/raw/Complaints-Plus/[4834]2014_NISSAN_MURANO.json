It has simply flopped down and is blocking my view through the windshield.  The only way I can operate my Murano is to move the visor to the left against the window of the driver's door.  From the research I have done I have gleaned that this is an intrinsic design flaw common on all Murano and Rouge vehicles.  And replacing it with an OEM sun visor at the dealership will not remedy the problem since the one they install will also fail eventually.  Nissan has turned a deaf ear and blind eye to this critical safety hazard that obstructs the driver's forward view.  There should be a recall on these visors.  But don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen.  I, for one, am NOT going to shell out the $400 that the dealership wants for the replacement visor...nor am I going to pay $150 an hour shop labor to have it installed.  People be aware that there are NON-OEM replacement visors available on eBay and Amazon in the $50 price range and if you look on YouTube there are videos showing how to simply and easily install the new visor yourself with little more than a flathead screwdriver and a phillips head screw driver.  Best of luck to everyone!",
