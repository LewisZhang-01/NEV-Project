I WAS ADVISED AT THAT TIME THAT THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP , IN EITHER DIRECTION, WAS 4-5 HOURS FROM WHERE I LIVE. I WAS ADVISED THAT I NEEDED TO CALL ALL THE MECHANICS IN THE AREA TO FIND ONE THAT IS CERTIFIED BY MITSUBISHI!  IF I COULD FIND ONE AND THEY WERE MITSUBISHI CERTIFIED, THE WORK WOULD BE DONE AND MITSUBISHI WOULD PAY FOR IT. HOWEVER, THEY NEED TO HAVE CURRENT CERTIFICATION. I HAVE CALLED A FEW DEALERSHIPS IN THE AREA, BUT NO ONE HAS A CERTIFICATION FOR MITSUBISHI.     I DIDN'T INSTALL THE BAD AIRBAGS. I WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL TO EITHER OF THESE DEALERSHIPS, SPEND THE NIGHT IN A MOTEL,  WAIT FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND WORK TO BE DONE, AND DRIVE HOME. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
