HAD IT TOWED BACK TO THEIR SERVICE STATION  AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PROBLEM, THAT COST ME $600. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ANY DAMAGE UNDER THE HOOD.

IT IS 'AS IS'   I CALLED AND TEXT THE SALES GIRL AND NEVER RECEIVED A CALL BACK OR RESPONSE.   FINALLY PUT A BAD REVIEW ON THEIR WEBSITE AND RECEIVED AN E-MAIL TO CONTACT MANAGER TO HELP WITH THE SITUATION, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT WAS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL AND AGAIN TOLD 'TOO BAD'. IT IS NOW JULY AND YET AGAIN IT BROKE DOWN ON MY DAUGHTER AS SHE WAS AT THE GAS STATION.  IT WOULD NOT START UP AFTER SHE TURNED IT OFF.  TRIED TO JUMP IT AND NOTHING.    ONCE AGAIN HEADED TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE STATION. AT FIRST WAS TOLD IT WAS ONLY THE BATTERY, SO I SAY GO AHEAD, I WILL PAY THE $140 AND REPLACE IT AND WE WILL GO FROM THERE.

THEY WOULD HAVE TO KEEP IT OVER THE WEEKEND.  IT IS COSTING ME AN ARM AND A LEG AND I NEED HELP WITH THIS.

MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE READ THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE INCIDENTS AFTER REPAIRING THE DAMAGE . THERE IS  NO DOUBT THERE IS A MAJOR FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE SUNROOF . THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE WIND DEFLECTOR  THAT INVOLVED PUTTING SOME TYPE OF FILM OVER THE DEFLECTOR THAT WOULD PREVENT IT FROM CRACKING IF HIT BY DEBRIS WHILE OPEN STOPPING IT FROM BREAKING APART AND FLYING OFF. I HAD THAT RECALL DONE IN 2007 .

I ALMOST REAR ENDED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME TAKING OFF FROM A STOP LIGHT. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SELLING DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE MGR. WENT ON A TEST DRIVE AND SAID HE NOTICED THE PROBLEM AT LEAST 5 TIMES IN A FEW MILE DRIVE. WHEN I PICKED MY CAR UP 2 DAYS LATER THE SERVICE INVOICE STATED \"UNABLE TO DUPLICATE\" AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED I HAVE A 30,000 MILE MAINT. DONE I HAD JUST HAD THOSE SERVICES DONE 1 MONTH EARLIER AND THEY WERE AWARE OF THAT. IT WAS THEN RECOMMENDED THAT I SWITCH GAS STATIONS AND USE HIGH OCTANE FUEL AND USE A FUEL INJECTION CLEANER PURCHASED FROM ANY GAS STATION, THEN IF NO IMPROVEMENT FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS WOULD BE NEEDED BUT NO CODES IN THE ECU. I FOLLOWED THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVER 2 MONTHS AND NO CHANGE. WENT BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND EVEN WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THE REGIONAL SERVICE MGR SENT TO \"INSPECT\" MY CAR DID NOT INSPECT IT AND REFUSED TO AUTHORIZE THE REPAIR AND SUBMIT THE CLAIM UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. I ALSO AT THIS TIME REMINDED THEM THAT THE SPEEDOMETER DOES NOT WORK ALL THE TIME. AND WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK AND THE CAR IS IDLING THE SPEEDOMETER SHOWS A SPEED OF 5-10 MILES PER HOUR, YET WHILE DRIVING SHOWS A SPEED OF 0.

WHY WERE WE NOT TOLD BY MCGEE TOYOTA WHEN SHE BOUGHT THE CAR, THAT THE WINDSHIELD HAD BEEN REPLACED? MR MURPHY SAID HE WOULD DO ANYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE US HAPPY. MR MURPHY SAID HE WOULD REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES ON THE CAR (BECAUSE WE ALSO NOTICED THERE WERE 3 DIFFERENT TIRES ON THE CAR), AS WELL AS REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD FOR US.

SUDDENLY I HEARD A LOUD NOISE, I SWERVED A QUITE BIT AND THEN I NOTICED GLASS WAS FALLING ON MY HEAD. I LOOKED UP TO SEE MY SUNROOF WAS GONE. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY REPLACED THE GLASS ON WARRANTY. SINCE IT WAS REPLACED AT NO CHARGE TO ME I WAS SATISFIED. THE SECOND INCIDENT HAPPENED LAST SATURDAY NIGHT (9-16-06). I WAS DRIVING HOME WITH THE SUNROOF CLOSED.THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS AROUND. WE HEARD A QUIETER NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE GLASS SHATTERING; WE LOOKED AT ALL THE WINDOWS BUT SAW NOTHING WRONG. THE NEXT DAY I NOTICED THAT THE WIND DEFLECTOR WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED. MOST OF THE PIECES OF GLASS WERE STILL THERE EXCEPT THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GLASS. I'VE HAD THE PLASTIC FILM PUT ON THE CAR ACCORDING TO THE RECALL BUT IT ISN'T COMPLETELY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE IS GLASS MISSING. THE DEALERSHIP WOULDN'T REPLACE THE PART ON WARRANTY. I AM NOW IN A DISPUTE WITH SCION TO GET THEM TO REPLACE THE DEFLECTOR. MY CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY YET THEY WON'T REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART STATING THAT THEY HAVE A POLICY AGAINST REPLACING GLASS FOR ANY REASON. I HAVE TRIED FOR A WEEK NOW TO RESOLVE THIS WITH SCION. THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT A REPRESENTATIVE WILL CALL ME THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY YET THEY DON'T CALL ME.  I HAVE TOLD THEM EVERY TIME THAT I CALLED THAT I CAN'T DRIVE MY CAR UNTIL THIS HAS BEEN RESOLVED. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND, ON SCION'S FORUM (WWW.SCIONLIFE.COM), MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TOO. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT STATE THEIR DEFLECTOR HAS SHATTERED,OTHER PEOPLE'S SUNROOF HAS SHATTERED AND STILL OTHER PEOPLE'S MOON ROOF HAS SHATTERED. SOME PEOPLE WERE MOVING WHEN IT HAPPENED, OTHERS WERE PARKED.SCION REPLACED THE PART ON MOST OF THE OTHER VEHICLES.WITH ALL THE GLASS PANELS IN THE ROOFS OF THESE CARS SHATTERING FOR UNKNOWN REASONS IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THERE IS A DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW.*NM",
