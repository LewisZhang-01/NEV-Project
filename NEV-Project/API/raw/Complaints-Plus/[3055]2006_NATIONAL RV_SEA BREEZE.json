        "summary": "DEFECT: DOMETIC 2 DOOR REFRIGERATOR CRACK IN THE COOLING COIL AT THE BURNER AREA RESULTING IN A POSSIBLE FIRE. THERE IS A RECALL #08E-032. THE RECALL IS TOO LIMITED IN SCOPE AS IT DOES NOT ADDRESS UNITS THAT HAVE FAILED. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL AND ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AFTER MY REFRIGERATOR COIL HAD CRACKED AND LEAKED ON THE BURNER UNIT. I NOTICED IT BEFORE THERE WAS A FIRE AND TURNED THE UNIT OFF. I CONTACTED DOMETIC AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD INSTALL THE \"FIX KIT\" FOR FREE AFTER I PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO PURCHASE PARTS FROM DOMETIC AND HAVE MY REFRIGERATOR REPAIRED. I AM THANKFUL THE LEAK HAPPENED WHEN I HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT THERE TO TURN IT OFF. IF IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT NIGHT IT MAY HAVE CAUGHT FIRE WHILE I WAS SLEEPING AND I MIGHT NOT BE HERE TO WRITE THIS. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS MOTORHOME BUT HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL INFORMATION. I FEEL DOMETIC SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING AN UNSAFE/DEFECTIVE PRODUCT WHERE CONSUMERS COULD SUFFER A LOSS OF PROPERTY, INJURY OR DEATH.  *TR",
