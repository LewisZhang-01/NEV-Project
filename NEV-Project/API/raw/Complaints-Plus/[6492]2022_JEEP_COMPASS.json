Nothing works as far as cruise control blind spot warning nothing I all says needs to he serviced. When this happens if they vehicle is cruise control you lose cruise control until the vehicle decides you can have it back. We\u2019ve Had the loaner for 2 weeks and it happens every single day at least twice a day. Around the same times every day.",
