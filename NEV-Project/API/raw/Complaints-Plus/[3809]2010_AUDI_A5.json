ACCORDING TO MY DEALER, AUDI IS AWARE THAT THESE PLASTIC WATER PUMPS ARE DEFECTIVE BUT DID NOT INFORM AUDI DRIVERS FOR TWO REASONS: 1) THEY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT PARTS IN STOCK TO REPLACE ALL THE PROBABLE DEFECTIVE ONES AND ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS, THEY MUST HAVE AMPLE PARTS BEFORE THEY CAN ISSUE A VOLUNTARY RECALL; AND 2) IT HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT COMPLAINTS. THE DEALER REPLACED THE BROKEN PUMP WITH ONE THAT IS NOW SUPPOSEDLY MADE OF METAL INSTEAD OF PLASTIC. IT TOOK THEM ONLY A DAY TO GET THE REPLACEMENT PART IN, AS OPPOSED TO A WEEK THE FIRST TIME THIS OCCURRED. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH 5-10 CASES OF BROKEN WATER PUMPS EACH WEEK SINCE THE COLD WEATHER STARTED - AUDI A5/Q5S. *TR",

THERE ARE TWO ISSUES: 1.) THE AUTOMATIC RAIN SENSOR OVERRIDES DIRECT DRIVER INPUT SO THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I TURN THEM ON, THEY DO NOT STAY ON CAUSING IMPAIRED VISION. 2.) THE UNIQUE WIPER DESIGN OF THE B8 PLATFORM MEANS THAT THE WIPER BLADES THEMSELVES CONSISTENTLY TURN INTO BLOCKS OF ICE IN WINTER DRIVING.  THEY ARE POSITIONED BELOW THE DEFROSTER AND, ONCE FROZEN, CAUSE SEVERELY IMPAIRED VISION IN ALREADY HAZARDOUS DRIVING CONDITIONS.      I'VE CHECKED NUMEROUS ONLINE FORUMS AND THIS CONDITION IS OCCURRING REGULARLY TO OWNERS OF AUDI VEHICLES BASED ON THE B8 PLATFOM (PREDOMINANTLY THE A4/S4 AND A5/S5.)  THEY ALL SHARE THE SAME RAIN SENSOR/ WINDSHIELD WIPER DESIGN, AND IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE TRACTION OF QUATTRO MEANS NOTHING IF YOU CAN'T SEE! *TR",
