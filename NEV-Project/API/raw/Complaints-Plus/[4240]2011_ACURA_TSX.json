Included with the genuine Acura replacement part (# 73162-tl2-305zd) was service bulletin # 09-030 which states that the glue needs to be replaced. I talked to Acura of Wappingers service and parts department and Acura of America regarding this issue. All parties denied replacing the glue on the clips. Some of the clips are very out of place due to what I believe is the glue softening in the sun. I truly believe this is a safety hazard because of the potential of this panel hits a pedestrian or car and creating an accident with potential injury or death. Car has been in 0 accidents. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",

        "summary": "While driving my 2011 Acura TSX wagon on 10 July 2021, the power steering failure indicator light came on while crossing a bridge and my power steering immediately failed. After the vehicle was towed home, I searched the manual and found there is no power steering reservoir to check for fluid.   So I researched YouTube and found that this power steering has been a major problem with this vehicle.  This is extremely dangerous and as I was on a bridge the danger was even greater as I could not pull over.  I managed to safely exit but could not pull into a parking lot as there was not enough distance to keep the vehicle moving and I was unable to turn the wheel while the vehicle was almost at a standstill. When I got the car home, I researched how to correct the problem.  Since the manual was useless, I turned to YouTube and proceeded to check the fuse first.   It was not blown.  The steering control module needs to be replaced and the authorized dealership wants $1500 to $2000 to replace.  My car has been well maintained and just turned 80,000 miles.  This is a safety issue and could have put me in a very dangerous situation since I was unable to steer my vehicle!   Please contact my husband as soon as possible about replacing the power steering module as I need the use of my car!
