Let us protect your   Stacey Dodier 1 message In 2019 I purchased a 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander from Mitsubishi dealership in Lagrange, Ga. I was assured that the vehicle was safe and reliable. As a precaution I purchased an extended power train warranty for $2,325. After my purchase the dealership sent emails reminding me to complete basic services such as oil change and tire rotation without any mention of transmission fluid exchange. Fast forward to January 2022 I was riding on the interstate and the transmission light flashed quickly. The vehicle stalled on the highway and I barely had time pull over and avoid being hit by other drivers. At that moment I knew something was terribly wrong with my vehicle. I had the car towed to Heritage Mitsubishi in Morrow, Ga. Around January 25th a service advisor from the Heritage Dealership informed me that the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander that I owe almost $16,000 on needs a new transmission which would in total cost $8800. I was totally shocked and when I asked why the advisor said that the CVT transmission is expensive and the person who sold you the car should have told you to change transmission fluid every 30,000 miles. I was in shock because I had never worried about transmission issues with any other vehicles. As of now the engine light is on and I still don't feel Safe driving this vehicle",

        "summary": "When driving my 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SE down the highway last week my car began to make a shudder like feeling when I stepped on the gas. When attempting to accelerate my car my RPMs jumped and then dropped significantly making the car shake and not accelerate and instead the speed declined. I was on the highway driving and feel very fortunate that no one was behind me when my car jerked causing them to possibly rear end me and I am glad that my car did not jolt forward hitting the person in-front of me but it was a very real possibility. My car is around 98,000 miles and has had every oil change and maintenance it has needed on time and I am the second owner of this car. No check engine light or anything came on while my car was practically breaking down on the highway and there was no warning. The next day the check engine light came on for about 10 mins and then cleared itself even though the car was continuing to shake and drop and rev RPMS. I took my car to an automotive place and they told me I would need to have a new transmission put in the car and he thought I had very low miles to be having this issue and because the engine light was no longer on he test drove the car and confirmed and ran the error code in the history. After some research I noticed that there was a recall in 2016 for the transmission of my car 16v563000 stating that there is a delay in the transmission and the consequence could cause a crash and to fix the problem \"software needed to be upgraded\" I asked North America Mitsubishi for a report of the specific work done to the transmission to provide to my mechanic. They stated they cant do that and I don't need it and can get my transmission done at Mitsubishi where they can see the previous work done for the recall. There is a technical service bulletin for this issue its so common, I am 1 year over the 5 yr warranty and they say I have to pay for a new transmission. I was told theres no recall and nothing they can do.",

Had it towed to the dealership. They checked it out and the transmission CVT is shot. Mind you this vehicle has only 118,000 and is only 5 yrs. old and with regular maintenance on it. The dealership just quoted me price to fix it would be $10,000. We still owe about $3500 left on payments. We don't have $10,000 to shell out for another transmission. Did some digging and seems like a lot of people are having the same problem with this transmission. This should be fixed for free and needs to be recalled. Someone is gonna be hurt seriously or killed because of this.",

SINCE OWNING THIS SUV I HAVE HAD THE  BULBS REPLACED  5 TIMES ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND 7 TIMES ON THE LEFT.WAS TOLD BY AUTOZONE THAT THEY BELIEVE THE SEAL AROUND THE LIGHT IS CAUSING THE MOISTURE TO ENTER AND CARRODE  .NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM!. THE PRICE OF THESE REPLACEMENT  BULBS ARE NOT CHEAP.I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE LIKE THIS ON ANY OF MY VEHICLES DURING MY LIFETIME.... I SEE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS ISSUE, I FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS BY SEARCHING THE NET..I FEEL THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE AND IT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED BY MITSUBISHI.",

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IS THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, THE BELT AND THE PULLEY START TO GRIND AGAINST EACH OTHER AND REDUCE THE SIZE OF EACH AND CAUSE SLIPPING OF THE TRANSMISSION. METAL SHAVINGS BEGIN TO APPEAR IN THE TRANSMISSION PAN SHOWING THE WEAR. THE DESIGN ALSO MANDATES THAT THE VEHICLE OWNER CHANGE THE FLUID AND FILTER EVERY 30,000 MILES AT THE COST OF $200 TO $300 OUT OF THE OWNERS POCKET. WHEN THIS TRANSMISSION STARTS PRODUCING METAL SHAVINGS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TRANSMISSION PAN, SUCH AS IT HAS IN MY VEHICLE, WHICH ONLY HAS 103,000 MILES AND THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD, REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION IS THE ONLY OPTION. THE DEALERSHIP COSTS $9,400 AND A COUPLE OF TRANSMISSION SHOPS HAVE QUOTED $7,400. THIS TECHNOLOGY COSTS THE CONSUMER MORE TO NOT ONLY OPERATE BUT ALSO DEVALUES THE PRICE OF THEIR VEHICLE IN A SHORT SPAN OF TIME. MOST TRANSMISSION EXPERTS ESTIMATE AND HAVE EXPERIENCED TROUBLE WITH THIS TRANSMISSION TO LAST NO MORE THAN 3 TO 5 YEARS BEFORE IT MUST BE REPLACED. I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE TO THE MITSUBISHI DEALERSHIP AND TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP FOR A 2ND OPINION ABOUT THE SLIPPING. THE TRANSMISSION ONLY SLIPS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS FIRST ENGAGED INTO GEAR. AFTER A 2 SECOND HESITATION, THE VEHICLE DRIVES WITHOUT ANY ISSUES. I HAVE CONTACTED THE BBB, THE LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL, MITSUBISHI'S US HEADQUARTERS, SEVERAL ATTORNEYS, WHO WON'T REPRESENT ME BECAUSE NOBODY HAS GOTTEN INJURED, AND I HAVE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER OF THE TRANSMISSION (JATCO USA, INC}.

ONCE I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY GET OFF THE FREEWAY, I PULLED INTO A GAS STATION AND INSPECTED THE CAR.  FINDINGS INCLUDE: 1) LOW TIRE GAUGE LIGHT ON (AFTER LEAVING THE AIRPORT, BEFORE THE TIRE BLEW OUT), 2) WHAT LOOKED LIKE DUCT TAPE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD, POSSIBLY INDICATING A NEW WINDSHIELD HAD RECENTLY BEEN INSTALLED 3) A BROKEN TAIL LIGHT ON THE LEFT REAR 4) THE KEY TAG HAD THE PHRASE \"SAFETY RECALL\" ON IT AND 5) THE TIRE BLEW OUT.  I CALLED AVIS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT I FOUND.  I TOLD THEM I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE CAR AS IT APPEARED TO HAVE A SAFETY RECALL AND POSSIBLY HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO HOBBY AIRPORT.  ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE REPLACED THE DAMAGED TIRE, AND I DROVE THE CAR TO THE NEAREST AVIS APPROXIMATELY 6 MILES AWAY AND EXCHANGED THE CAR. WHEN I RETURNED THE 2ND CAR, I TOLD THE LADY WHO CHECKED IN THE CAR WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 1ST CAR.  SHE INFORMED A MANAGER AND CAME BACK TO ME.  SHE SAID, HER MANAGER SAID THE CAR WAS ON A RECALL AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RENTED.  THE MANAGER ALSO TOLD HER I COULD SUE AVIS.

SHE SAID THE CAR DIDN'T STOP WHEN SHE HIT THE BRAKES AND THAT THE BRAKES DON'T WORK.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED BY GEICO FOR $20K DAMAGE PAID AND SHE SAID SHE WASN'T DRIVING IT ANYMORE.  SHE HAD MULTIPLE INJURIES FROM THE AIRBAGS AND SAW THE DOCTOR.  AFTER REPAIRS, WE ENDED UP SWITCHING CARS AND THE OUTLANDER BECAME MY CAR AND I NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED VERY HEAVY LIKE IT WAS SURGING FORWARD AND RESISTED STOPPING.  TWO MONTHS LATER I CHANGED THE OIL ON THE OTHER CAR, SO I ASKED HER TO TAKE THE OUTLANDER JUST FOR THE DAY.  SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE IT, BUT I SAID JUST BE VERY CAREFUL.  SHE HAD A SECOND ACCIDENT THAT DAY ON THE HIGHWAY CAUSING $10K DAMAGES FOR REPAIR AND THE AIR BAGS NEVER DEPLOYED THIS TIME AND HER HEAD, CHEST AND KNEES HIT HARD AGAINST THE STEERING WHEEL AND DASHBOARD AND HER BACK SNAPPED AND SHE IS SEEING A CHIROPRACTOR NOW FOR THE PAIN.  SHE IS A GOOD DRIVER AND HAS NEVER HIT ANYONE FROM BEHIND AND NOW HAS DONE SO TWO TIMES IN TWO MONTHS?  AGAIN SHE TOLD ME THE CAR DIDN'T STOP WHEN SHE STEPPED ON THE BRAKES.  LAST WEEK WE RECEIVED A FACTORY RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL FOR THE ACCELERATOR.  I TOOK THE CAR IN THIS SATURDAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE IT REPAIRED.  WHEN I DROVE THE CAR AFTER THE REPAIR AND APPLIED THE BRAKES NOW IN COMPARISON TO BEFORE IT STOPS VERY WELL AND IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.  I BELIEVE MITSUBISHI'S DEFECTIVE ACCELERATION SYSTEM IS THE CAUSE OF MY WIFE'S INJURIES TO HER HEAD, BACK AND KNEES.  THIS ACCIDENT IS NOT MY WIFE'S FAULT AT ALL.  I AM SURE THAT THIS DEFECT IN THE ACCELERATOR SYSTEM WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENTS AND I AM ASKING THE NHTSA TO PLEASE RECTIFY THIS WITH MITSUBISHI FOR US TO FIND CAUSE TO BE PLACED ON MITSUBISHI'S FAULTY VEHICLE NOT US.

I POINTED THIS OUT TO HIM AND HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT IT WAS HIS VEHICLE AND HE WAS AWARE OF IT.
