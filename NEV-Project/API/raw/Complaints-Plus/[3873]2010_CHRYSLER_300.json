HE SAID THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF YOU ARE DRIVING ON A FREEWAY AT 70MPH AND THE ENGINE BLOWS YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE SO I MAY KILL OR HURT MYSELF OR THOSE WITH ME OR CAUSE AN ACCIDENT KILLING OR HURTING SOMEONE ELSE. CHRYSLER HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS SINCE 2014 OR EARLIER BUT THEY REFUSE TO FIX THE PROBLEM ON THE 2.7 ENGINES HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DIE OR BE HURT BEFORE THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED? IT COST ME AN OTHER 1100.00 DOLLAR TO HAVE MY CAR FIXED BUT I KNOW IT'S DONE RIGHT. I FEEL NOW I CAN TAKE FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN MY CAR AND FEEL SAFE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL CHRYSLER CORP.

TOOK IT TO AAMCO AND THEY SAID A PLUG WAS MISSING AND ENGINE OIL LEAKED OUT ON THE MUFFLER AND CAUSED THE FIRE.     NEXT INCIDENT, CAR STARTED STALLING ON ME SEVERAL TIMES. TOOK IT TO A REPAIR SHOP AND WAS TOLD THE COMPUTER NEEDED TO BE RE-PROGRAMMED (APRIL 2013). A WEEK AFTER GETTING THE COMPUTER FIXED, THE CAR STARTED STALLING AGAIN AND THIS TIME I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR. GOT THAT FIXED AND 3 MONTHS LATER, THE CAR STARTED STALLING AGAIN. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD IT WAS BECAUSE I NEEDED A NEW BATTERY. GOT THE BATTERY PUT IN AND THEN IN JUNE OF 2014, I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AND THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED ON ME AND THE CAR SHUT OFF. I SMELLED SMOKE LIKE SOMETHING WAS BURNING. AFTER GETTING INDEPENDENT DIAGNOSIS FROM THREE DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS AND AUTOMOTIVE SHOPS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MY ENGINE COMPLETELY FAILED.
