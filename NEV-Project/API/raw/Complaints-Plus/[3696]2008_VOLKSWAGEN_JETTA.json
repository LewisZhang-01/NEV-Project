I TOOK THE CAR TO THE VW DEALERSHIP WHICH COST $480 TO FIXED ONE DOOR. ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AFTER FIXING THE DOOR, SOMEONE BROKE INTO THE CAR WHICH I LATER FOUND OUT THAT THE DRIVER SIDE REAR DOOR LOCK ALSO FAILED AND WASN'T WORKING. THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME WAS, MANUALLY USING THE KEY WOULD ONLY LOCK THREE DOORS (2 FRONT DOOR AND PASSENGER SIDE REAR DOOR, WHICH I HAD FIXED PRIOR TO THE SECOND FAILURE). I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND HAD TO PAY ANOTHER $480 TO GET IT FIXED. ABOUT A MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND FAILURE, THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE DOOR LOCK STOP WORKING WHICH COST ME ANOTHER $480. CURRENTLY, THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR LOCK IS NOT WORKING. I ASKED THE VOLKSWAGEN SERVICE ADVISOR IF VOLKSWAGEN IS GOING TO OR PLANNING ON CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM AND THE ANSWER I GOT WAS 'NO, IT'S NOT A SAFETY ISSUE.' WHY DO CAR DOORS LOCK AUTOMATICALLY WHILE DRIVING? COULD IT SOMEWHAT BE FOR SAFETY REASON? WHEN ONE OF THE DOOR LOCK FAILS, THE CAR DOORS ARE NOT LOCKED WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS A WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE VOLKSWAGEN MODELS. DOES VOLKSWAGEN CARES? COULD THIS BE DANGEROUS FOR A CHILD OR ADULT IN THE BACK/FRONT SEAT OF A CAR DRIVING AROUND WITH UNLOCK DOORS?

I CHECKED THE INDICATOR LIGHTS AND NO LIGHTS WERE ON THAT INDICATED THERE WAS A PROBLEMS. AT THE STOP SIGN NEAR THE ENTRANCE NEAR THE NAVY ANNEX OFF COLOMBIA PIKE, I NOTICED A SMELL SIMILAR TO BURNING OIL.  FIRST, THE VEHICLE WAS CHECKED BY JACK TAYLOR TOYOTA IN ALEXANDRIA, VA.

ACCORDING TO THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST, THE  REAR MAIN SEAL, WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE REAR OF THE ENGINE BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND THE FLYWHEEL OF FLEX PLATE/TORQUE CONVERTER WAS LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID.  I LEARNED LATER VIA AN INTERNET SEARCH THERE WAS A VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES FROM THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  I CONSULTED WITH A TECHNICIAN AT VOLKSWAGEN WHO INDICATED THE PROBLEM DESCRIBED BY TOYOTA WAS CONFUSING AND WAS POSSIBLY AN ERROR WAS ASKED  TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN FOR A CERTIFIED VOLKSWAGEN TECHNICIAN TO INSPECT FURTHER. PRESENTLY, THE CAR IS AT THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP IN ALEXANDRIA, VA FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND REPAIRS. THEY CONFIRMED THE REAR MAIN SEAL WAS LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID AND ORDERED THE PART WHICH WAS PROJECTED TO ARRIVE ON OR ABOUT 13 FEBRUARY 2012.

THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR SHOP HAD JUST INFORMED ME THAT THE BRAKES WERE FINE AT 10,000 MILES.  THE ROTORS AND BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED AT MY COST AS IT IS NOT A WARRANTY ITEM BUT A WEAR ITEM.  AT MY 20,000 MILE CHECKUP, I WAS AGAIN TOLD THAT MY BRAKES WERE FINE AND HAD 50% REMAINING.  I TOOK THE CAR TO MEINEKE TO HAVE THE BRAKES DOUBLE CHECKED.  I WAS SHOWN THAT THE REAR CALIPERS ARE DEFECTIVE. THEY DO NOT ALLOW THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO DISENGAGE.  AS SUCH, MY EMERGENCY BRAKE IS CONSTANTLY ON, CAUSING MY BRAKES TO LOCK ON TO THE ROTOR.  THE MECHANIC HAD TO USE A CROW BAR TO PRY LOOSE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  I WAS TOLD THAT I CANNOT USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE UNTIL IT IS FIXED.  I HAVE A 5 SPEED AND THIS IS CONCERNING THAT I CANNOT USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED THAT THE WARRANTY WILL ONLY ALLOW THEM TO REPLACE ONE CALIPER AT A TIME.  IF THE OTHER ONE IS BROKEN, THEN I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I DRIVE IT A WHILE AFTER ONE IS REPLACED.  I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DATA ONLINE ABOUT THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM IN SEVERAL MODEL YEARS OF THE VOLKSWAGEN JETTA.  INTERESTINGLY, MY DEALERSHIP WAS OUT OF THE CALIPERS AND HAD TO REORDER MORE.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED THAT MY SAFETY HAS BEEN IN JEOPARDY AS MY BRAKES COULD HAVE ONCE AGAIN FAILED.  I AM UPSET THAT THE DEALERSHIP NEGLECTED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  I HAD TO TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT MECHANIC TO FINALLY HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED.  INCIDENTALLY, PART OF MY ENGINE WENT OUT WITHIN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF OWNING THE CAR.  I HAVE ALSO HAD TO HAVE THE FRONT END REPAINTED AS IT BEGAN CHIPPING IMMEDIATELY. NOW THE DOOR EDGES AND THE TOP EDGE OF THE HOOD ARE CHIPPING. *TR",

WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS OF OWNING THE CAR, WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE WHEN IN DRIVE, THE CAR WOULD LUNGE FORWARD. THE CONDITION KEPT GETTING WORSE AND BEGAN ALSO LUNGING FORWARD WHEN IDLING. I TOOK IT TO THE SERVICE DEPT. OF THE VW DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR. THEY SAID IT HAD TO DO WITH THE COMPUTER MEMORY IN MY CAR AND IT WAS MEMORIZING HOW I DRIVE AND IF I SWITCHED OVER TO ANOTHER DRIVER IT WOULD BE CONFUSED AND LUNGE. THIS IS WRITTEN ON MY RECEIPT FOR THE WORK: \"ADVISE CUSTOMER TO ONLY DRIVE THE VEHICLE. IT IS ACTING AS IF TWO PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AND THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING IS CONFUSED. NO CODES STORED.\"     MY CAR IS CONFUSED, THEREFORE THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE DRIVER????  SOUNDED SILLY TO ME, BUT I NEEDED MY CAR AND I ACCEPTED THAT EXPLANATION AND LEFT. THE CONDITION ONLY WORSENED. THE LUNGE OR SURGING FORWARD BECAME SO NOTICEABLE THAT IT WAS EMBARRASSING. MY HUSBAND SAID HE ALSO NOTICED IT LUNGING OR SURGING IN THE REVERSE GEAR AS WELL AS FORWARD AND IDLE. I RETURNED IT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE VW DEALERSHIP JULY 13, 2009. THEY HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS A FAULTY MECHATRONICS UNIT. THEY CANNOT EVEN GET THE PART UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK IN AUGUST.  THEY TOLD ME THAT PROBLEMS WITH THE MECHATRONICS UNIT ARE RARE. HOWEVER, I DID MY OWN RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE VW JETTAS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. AND, THIS PART IS A BIT WEIRD...MANY OF THEM HAD TO WAIT WEEKS FOR THE PART. ONE PERSON REPORTED THAT THE \"SURGING FORWARD\" WAS SO BAD THAT HE HIT ANOTHER CAR. I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE THIS CONDITION COULD  BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO  OWN A NEW CAR THAT HAS SOMETHING SO MAJOR WRONG WITH IT.

BY THE HARSH DOWNSHIFT I MEAN WHEN SLOWING DOWN COMING TO A STOP WHEN THE GEARBOX WOULD SHIFT FROM 2ND GEAR DOWN INTO 1ST GEAR I WOULD ALWAYS EXPERIENCE A LOUD METALLIC \"CLUNK\" NOISE.  IN REGARDS TO THE SURGING WHILE IN DRIVE I MEAN WHEN AT A DEAD STOP AND YOU GIVE EVEN/SLIGHT PEDAL PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR THE CAR WOULD SURGE FORWARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE YOU WERE STEPPING ON THE GAS AND THEN LETTING OFF.  THIS CHARACTERISTIC WAS VERY PREVALENT ON AN INCLINE.  THE VW DEALERSHIP I WORK WITH DIAGNOSED THE  PROBLEM AS A FAULTY MECHATRONICS UNIT WHICH CONTROLS THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPLEX DSG TRANSMISSION.  IT WAS REPLACED AT 5000 MILES.  AFTER DRIVING WITH THE NEW MECHATRONICS UNIT INSTALLED FOR ROUGHLY 6000 MORE MILES I STARTED TO NOW EXPERIENCE THE SAME SURGING ISSUES BUT WHEN THE CAR WAS IN REVERSE.  I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE RPM'S WOULD ALWAYS DROP LIKE THE ENGINE WAS GOING TO STALL EVERYTIME I WOULD SHIFT INTO DRIVE FROM PARK.  AND LASTLY WHEN STARTING FROM A STOP, APPLYING EVEN ACCELERATOR PEDAL PRESSURE, THE CAR WOULD ALWAYS \"JUMP\" OFF THE LINE.  BROUGHT IT INTO THE VW DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THEY ENDED UP REPLACING THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION.
