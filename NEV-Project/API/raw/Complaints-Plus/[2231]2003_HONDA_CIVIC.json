AT THE MEANTIME, THE ACCELERATOR SEEMS NOT STOP WHILE I WAS PUSHING DOWN THE BREAK, ON THE OPPOSITE IT WAS INCREASING THE SPEED... IN GENERAL, THE SPEED WAS SLOWING DOWN BUT IT WAS SUPER SLOW. I COULD TELL MY CAR WAS IN A SUPER BAD SITUATION. I WAS VERY LUCKY THAT THERE WEREN'T LOT OF CARS NEAR TO ME, I IMMEDIATELY TURNED ON THE EMERGENCY LIGHT AND TURNED MY CAR TO THE EMERGENCY LANE.  I FINALLY MADE CAR REDUCING THE SPEED TO 20 MPH WHILE MY CAR WAS IN THE EMERGENCY LANE, BUT IT WAS STILL MOVING THAT I HAD TO MAKE A EMERGENCY BREAK AND TURNED MY CAR OFF. IT WAS A HORRIBLE DRIVING EXPERIENCE I NEVER EVER HAD. I SENT MY TO THE REPAIR STORE, THE RESULT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM OF MY CAR IS THE ACCELERATOR GOT STUCK THAT EFFECTED THE BREAK COULDN'T SLOW DOWN THE SPEED, ALSO MY BREAK HAD SOME ISSUES TOO. I SPENT $1,699.00 TO GET MY CAR FIXED IN THE END.   I THINK THIS PROBLEM SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO ANY CARS, ITS VERY DANGEROUS AND IT WILL BE A BIG POSSIBLE TO CAUSE THE CAR ACCIDENT.

WHEN I'M SITTING IDLE IN TRAFFIC FOR A WHILE IT WILL RUN HOT OR AT LEAST APPEAR TO RUN HOT BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO HOT. I HAVE READ A FEW BLOGS AND SPOKEN TO A HONDA SPECIALIST AND HE CONFIRMED WHAT I READ ABOUT CIVICS RANGING FROM 2001 TO 2004 ARE NOTORIOUS FOR RUNNING HOT. I WAS TOLD THAT YOU HAVE TO REPLACE EVERYTHING LIKE THE WATER PUMP OR RADIATOR AS WELL AS THE HEAD GASKET AT THE SAME TIME TO STOP THIS FROM REOCCURRING. I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO REPAIR THIS ISSUE. I JUST WANT HONDA TO BE TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. THIS MATTER NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO AND A RECALL SHOULD BE CREATED.  THESE ARE SOME OF THE BLOGS I HAVE READ. THANK YOU.

I AM NOW LOOKING INTO HAVING THE MODULE REPAIRED OR REPLACED AS THE AIRBAGS WILL FAIL TO WORK IN A COLLISION DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS THAT YOU CAN READILY FIND ONLINE ABOUT THESE MODULES FAILING. HONDA SHOULD HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO FIX THESE IRREGARDLESS OF MILEAGE OR AGE.   *TR",

ON RETURN FROM WORK I FOUND BOTH HEADLIGHTS OUT, NO BLOWN FUSES, HEATER FAN NOT WORKING, BOTH ABS AND BRAKE PANEL LIGHTS ON. I SCHEDULED REPAIR AT O'HARE HONDA, DES PLAINES, IL. I ARRIVED AT THE SERVICE DEPT. WITH RECALL NOTICE AND ALSO TO HAVE ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE SERVICES. I LEFT THE CAR FOR THEM TO WORK ON IT. REPAIR WORK DONE ON INVOICE #410741 DATED NOV.19, 2012. THE SERVICE WRITER CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THE BRAKE LIGHT REPAIR REQUIRED THE MASTER CYLINDER TO BE REPLACED. I OK'D  MAJOR WORK. SERVICE WRITER CALLED BACK TO SAY THE ABS MODULE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED TOO. I OK'D THAT REPAIR AT LARGE COST ALSO. WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR THE SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THEY \"PUT IN A FREE ALTERNATOR AS THAT TOO WAS BAD\". THE HEADLIGHT REPAIR COST $1,877.77 ($1,326.17 FOR PARTS + $551.60 LABOR).     I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS REPAIR AND HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE VOLTAGE REGULATOR ON THE ALTERNATOR FAILED AND PUT A LARGE SURGE ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OF THE CAR. THIS SURGE \"FRIED\" THE ELECTRICS ON THE TWO BRAKE PARTS AND BURNED OUT THE HEADLIGHTS. THE \"FREE\" ALTERNATOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CLUE TO THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.    I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME DEVICE CAN NOT BE INSTALLED INTO THE ELECTRICAL WIRING SYSTEM OF THE CAR TO PREVENT THIS EXPENSIVE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FAILURE. THE FINAL PROBLEM WITH THIS REPAIR WAS THAT I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THEM INSTALL NEW HEADLIGHT BULBS AS THEY MUST NOT HAVE CHECKED THEM AND THEY WERE STILL BURNED OUT.

AFTER A FEW DAYS OF LOOKING UNDER THE CAR AND NOT ABLE TO DETECT THE PROBLEM, I REMOVED THE REAR SEAT AND  NOTICED A LARGE AMOUNT OF GASOLINE UNDER THE SEAT.  I REMOVED THE HATCH TO THE FUEL PUMP AND NOTICED THAT THE FUEL PUMP  ASSEMBLY HAD NUMEROUS HAIR LINE CRACKS ON THE TOP AREA AND WHEN THE CAR WAS IN THE ON POSITION, FUEL WAS POURING OUT AND GOING UNDER THE REAR SEAT BOTTOM.    I HAVE SINCE ORDERED A REPLACEMENT FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY UNIT.      ANYHOW, THIS A  VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND COULD HAVE HAD DEADLY EFFECTS AS THE ELECTRONICS THAT CHARGE THE FUEL PUMP ARE RIGHT WHERE THE GAS WAS LEAKING.   ADDITIONALLY, IF THE DRIVER OF THE CAR WAS A SMOKER, WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE.  THIS ISSUE IS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW AND I'M SURE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF THIS MODEL CIVIC HAVE THIS SAME FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY UNIT.   THE PART NUMBER IS:  17045-S5A-A31 (KAUTEX.  *TR",

IT WAS HARD TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT IT WAS NOT MY IMAGINATION, EXCEPT FOR IT BEING REAL OBVIOUS ON AN INCLINE AND IT WAS GETTING WORSE. THE DEALER'S MECHANIC HEARD THE SOUND, TOO, AND SAID LET'S START WITH THE FLUID CHANGE IT WAS DUE FOR. THE CHANGE MADE IT GREAT AGAIN, BUT ONLY FOR A FEW THOUSAND MILES.

I BELIEVE THEY PUT THEIR FOOT ON THE BRAKE WHILE PUTTING ON THE GAS, ALMOST TO THE POINT OF STALLING (I THINK) TO CLEAN UP THE BAND. MINE WOULD BE THE 2ND CAR THEY WOULD DO IT ON. IT ALSO REQUIRES A CHANGE OF FLUID AFTER BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE CRUD FROM THE PARTS AND PUT IT INTO THE FLUID. THEY DID IT FOR FREE SINCE I HAD ALREADY ASKED THEM TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM, AND I HAD PAID FOR THE FLUID CHANGE TO FIX THE SAME PROBLEM. AGAIN, AFTER THEIR WORK IT WAS NICE AND QUIET AND SMOOTH, BUT ABOUT 3,000 MILES LATER IT IS COMING BACK AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW IF THEIR PROCESS DID ANYTHING, OR IF IT WAS JUST THE FRESH FLUID THAT HELPED LIKE IT DID THE FIRST TIME. I AM CONCERNED REPETITIONS OF THE PROCESS MIGHT DECREASE THE LIFE OF THE TRANSMISSION.

IF THIS DOES NOT GET REPAIRED, MY TRANSMISSION COULD FAIL COMPLETELY, AND AT ANY TIME. LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE START CLUTCHES IN 2003 HONDA CIVIC HYBRIDS ARE DEFECTIVE.  *TR",

ON ONE OCCASION AFTER HAVING THE CLUTCH REPLACED, TRANSMISSION FLUID SPRAYED ALL OVER THE ENGINE AND MANIFOLD WHILE TRAVELING DOWN THE INTERSTATE WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE FATALITY OR SERIOUS INJURY OF MY SON DRIVING THE CAR HAD IT IGNITED.

THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND HONDA IS USING A BAND AID APPROACH TO MASK THIS SERIOUS DEFECT UNTIL THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED, AT WHICH POINT, THEY QUICKLY SAY THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE AT THE OWNERS EXPENSE (APPROX $3,400 TO $4,000 DOLLARS).

WE HAVE ONLY TAKEN THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AND HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND THAT SHUDDER IS FROM AN \"OVERLOAD\".  TAKING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THEIR WORD, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REPAIR WORK DONE TO REMOVE THE SHUDDER OR TAKEN THE CAR TO ANOTHER DEALER.  OVER TIME THE SHUDDER HAS GOTTEN WORSE.  WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED A HESITATION WHEN ACCELERATING AND THEN THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY LURCH FORWARD WHEN IT HITS GEAR.  AGAIN, WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT HESITATION WHEN THE CAR IS SWITCHING FROM BATTERY POWER TO ENGINE POWER.      ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WAS IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT.  WE WERE GIVEN TWO OPTIONS-IMMEDIATE REPAIR OR DRIVE UNTIL THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER COMPLETELY FAILS.  RECENTLY THE IMA LIGHT CAME ON AND WE TOOK THE CAR FOR DIAGNOSIS.  THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE BATTERY PACK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  IN ADDITION, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS BEGINNING TO FAIL.  TO REPLACE THE CVT TRANSMISSION, BATTERY PACK AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $7,500.

SINCE THAN AMERICAN HONDA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE CVT TO 100,000 MILES BUT ACCORDING TO ALL THE COMPLAINT SITES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MONITOR HONDA INSTEAD USES DELAYING TACTICS UNTIL THE EXTENDED WARRANTY RUNS OUT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AS CAN BE SEEN BY THE NUMEROUS NEAR MISS TESTIMONIALS ON  YOUR NHTSA FILED COMPLAINT NARRATIVES. I AM A EMS BATTALION CAPTAIN FOR A MAJOR METROPOLITAN FIRE/RESCUE DEPARTMENT AND RESPOND TO DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES ON A DAILY BASIS. I AM ALSO A RESPECTED PUBLIC SAFETY ADVOCATE AND THE INITIATOR OF SENATE BILL 486. I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE WARRANTS SERIOUS INVESTIGATION. I BELIEVE DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY OCCURRED FROM THIS SAFETY HAZARD BUT WERE NEVER REPORTED NOR RECOGNIZED AS TO THE CAUSE.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE.   *TR",

ALTHOUGH THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE 2003 CVT TRANSMISSION, AMERICAN HONDA CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO ISSUE A FULL RECALL, CLAIMING IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. WE HAVE A RECORDING ON OUR ANSWERING MACHINE FROM THE ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER AT OUR HONDA DEALERSHIP SAYING THAT THE CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. THERE ARE MANY MORE 2003 HONDA CIVIC HYBRIDS ON THE ROAD WITH THIS SERIOUS ISSUE. FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN A CRASH WITH THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT MANDATED A RECALL FOR THIS GENERATION OF HONDA CVT TRANSMISSIONS IN JAPAN AND PARTS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.

I TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA OF TYSON?S CORNER IN VIRGINIA IN EARLY AUGUST 2007 AND THEIR SOLUTION WAS TO REPLACE THE CVT FLUID.  THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. NOW IN SEPTEMBER 2007 THE ISSUE IS BECOMING WORSE AND A LURCHING OR SLIPPAGE IS NOTICED AT SPEED UP TO 50 MPH.  I TOOK THE CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE AND THEY CONFIRMED A MAJOR TRANSMISSION ISSUE BUT DUE TO LACK OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY WERE NOT EQUIPPED TO REPAIR THE CVT.  THEY ALSO REPORTED THAT NO ENGINE TROUBLE CODES WERE DETECTED.  SEARCHING THE INTERNET IT APPEARS OTHER HCH OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE ONLY FIX SEEMS TO BE REPLACING THE CVT FLUID PROGRESSING TO REBUILDING OR REPLACING THE CVT WITHOUT CORRECTING THE CORE PROBLEM.

THE TIRES HAD ONLY BEEN ROTATED TWICE AND BOTH TIMES WERE SECURED USING FACTORY TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS, SO INCORRECT LUG NUT SETTINGS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.  NO EVIDENCE OF GLAZING FROM RIDING THE BRAKES WAS PRESENT, NOR HAS THE CAR EVER BEEN DRIVEN WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE DEPLOYED.  THE CAR IS BELIEVED TO BE DRIVEN WITHIN NORMAL TOLERANCES SINCE WE PURCHASED NEW IN 6/03 AND HAS BEEN USED MORE FOR COMMUTING MODE RATHER THAN A LOT OF STOP AND GO USEAGE.

LEFT REAR DOOR COMPLETELY SMASHED AND LEFT REAR WINDOW BROKEN OUT.  THE SIDE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  I INQUIRED WITH HONDA (LOCAL AND NATIONAL) INQUIRING IF THE SIDE AIR BAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL HONDA SAID THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE SIDE AIR BAG DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE OF IMPACT, ETC.  I TOLD THEM I WAS CONCERNED IF THE AIRBAGS WOULD FUNCTION IF I HAD ANOTHER WRECK.  THEY SAID IF SIDE AIR BAGS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING, A WARNING LIGHT WOULD BE ACTIVE ON THE DASH.  NO PARTS WERE REPLACED, ETC.  WHEN THE CAR WAS BEING REPAIRD AND WAS TORN DOWN IN BODY SHOP, I WENT TO THE SHOP AND LOOKED AT THE SENSORS AND THEIR LOCATION.  THEY WERE LOCATED AT THE BASE (FLOOR LEVEL) OF THE CAR, MIDWAY BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR.  THE CAR IS A COMPACT, AND NATURALLY SITS LOW ANYWAY.  MOST CAR BUMPERS ON IMPACT WILL HIT 1/3 OR 1/2 WAY UP THE DOOR, ESPECIALLY TRUCKS/SUVS.  IT SEEMS TO ME THE SENSORS ARE TOO LOW.  ALSO, I RECEIVED A LACERATION ON MY HEAD.  AS THE CAR SHIFTED STRONGLY TO THE RIGHT AT IMPACT, MY HEAD SLAMMED INTO THE SUPPORT HANDLE THAT IS POSITIONED ABOVE THE DRIVER'S WINDOW IN THE INTERIOR.  IN MY CALL TO HONDA'S NATIONAL OFFICE, I SUGGESTED THEY CHECK THE SIDE AIR BAG SENSORS ENGINEERING, AND THAT THEY REMOVE THE INTERIOR HANDLE ABOVE THE DRIVER'S WINDOW (I'VE NOTICED OTHER BRANDS OF VEHICLES DON'T HAVE THEM THERE).  SECOND INJURY WAS MY WIFE'S NECK BEING SORE AFTER THE WRECK FROM WHIPLASH.

WITHIN A MONTH I STARTED HAVING ACHES AND STIFFNESS IN MY NECK AND LOWER BACK.  AT TEN WEEKS I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN THAT I CALLED A CHIROPRACTOR, CRYING WITH PAIN, ON A SUNDAY MORNING TO BEG FOR HELP. (I HAD NOT REQUIRED CHIROPRACTIC HELP FOR THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS). THE CHIROPRACTOR TREATED MY BACK WITH HEAT AND MASSAGE FOR OVER AN HOUR AND THEN WENT WITH ME TO MY NEW CAR TO CHECK OUT THE SEATS.  SHE IMMEDIATELY POINTED OUT THAT  THE DESIGN OF THE SEAT GAVE NO BACK SUPPORT AND WAS TOO SHORT IN THE SEAT TO SUPPORT THE LEGS WHILE DRIVING. WITH THE DOCTOR'S HELP AND ADVICE AS TO CUSHIONS I COULD PURCHASE I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE ON THE TRIP BUT COULD ONLY DRIVE AN HOUR AT A TIME.  MY COUSIN DID MOST OF THE DRIVING FROM BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA TO PORTLAND, OREGON (APPROXIMATELY 900 MILES) WHILE I SAT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT ON SPECIAL CUSHIONS WITH MY FEET UP ON THE DASHBOARD TO RELIEVE THE PAIN.WHEN I GOT BACK HOME I WENT BACK TOT HE CHIROPRACTOR IMMEDIATELY, AND HAVE BEEN TREATED TWICE A WEEK FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS. I'M DOING PHYSICAL THERAPY AND USING A WIDE VARIETY OF SUPPORT CUSHIONS.  RELAX THE BACK STORES HAVE BECOME MY NEW BEST FRIEND.  BUT THE CIVIC IS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO BE COMFORTABLE IN.
