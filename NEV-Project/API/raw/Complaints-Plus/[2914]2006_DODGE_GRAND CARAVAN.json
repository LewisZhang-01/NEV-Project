THIS HAPPENED TO HER A FEW MORE TIMES (VERY STRESSFUL LOSING POWER STEERING AND BRAKES). THEREFORE, ONE FILL-UP TO CHECK IT I DROVE THE CAR AND IT DID THE SAME A COUPLE MINUTES AFTER FILL-UP DRIVING 1/4 MILE SLOWLY IN NEARBY HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT (AFRAID I WOULD HIT SOMEONE TRYING TO TURN (SIMILAR CONDITIONS AS MY WIFE HAD).

APPARENTLY, DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE VALVE THAT IS FAILING THE ENTIRE GAS TANK MUST ALSO BE REPLACED WHICH IS VERY COSTLY.

NOT WANTING TO PULL OVER IN AN AREA WITH LIMITED SHOULDER LANES, I CONTINUED DRIVING, BUT THE NOISE BECAME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER A PERIOD OF 50 MILES OR SO, TO THE POINT THAT I WAS ACTIVELY SEEKING A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER AND CHECK THE VEHICLE.     BEFORE I HAD A (SAFE) OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, A MUCH LARGER CLUNK WAS HEARD, AND THE VEHICLE INSTANTLY EXPERIENCED GREATLY IMPAIRED DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. I IMMEDIATELY SLOWED, AND WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A CONTROLLED STOP ON THE SHOULDER. VISUAL INSPECTION IMMEDIATELY SHOWED THAT THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE WHEEL HAD EXCESSIVE NEGATIVE CAMBER. THE STRUT SHAFT WAS ALSO NO LONGER MATED TO THE STEERING BEARING AT THE TOP OF THE STRUT TOWER, AND WAS RESTING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE STRUT TOWER. THE TOP SURFACE OF THE STRUT SHAFT HAD AN IRREGULAR, ROUGH FEEL TO IT, SUGGESTIVE OF BRITTLE FAILURE.    AFTER LIMPING THE VEHICLE DOWN THE NEAREST OFF-RAMP (APPROXIMATELY 1/2 MILE) AT LOW SPEED (10 MPH) I PARKED HE VEHICLE, AND HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL PEP BOYS, WHICH REPLACED BOTH FRONT STRUT ASSEMBLIES.",

PLEASE INCLUDE ME IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED COMPLAINT/INVESTIGATION #  DP 14-002.  AFTER REFUELING, MY ENGINE STALLS ABOUT 1 TO 2 MINUTES AFTER STARTING ALMOST EVERY TIME I FILL-UP WITH FUEL. WHEN THE FUELING NOZZLE TRIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME, I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTINUE ADDING MORE FUEL AND POSSIBLY OVERFILLING THE FUEL TANK.  I HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AT TIMES WITH THE ENGINE STALLING AND IT TAKES 2 TO 3 ATTEMPTS TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!   NOW AFTER REFUELING, I PULL AWAY FROM THE PUMPS AND PARK OUT OF THE WAY AND ALLOW  THE ENGINE TO STALL.  AFTER ATTEMPTING TO RESTART SEVERAL TIMES, THE ENGINE WILL MISFIRE FOR ABOUT 30 TO 45 SECONDS, THEN THE ENGINE WILL SMOOTH OUT AND RUN FINE UNTIL THE NEXT REFUELING.

AT THIS POINT I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL TRAVEL  WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN NORMAL AND THE PEDAL FELT VERY HARD.  THE PROBLEM GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND CAR WAS BARELY ABLE TO LIMP HOME.  IT FELT LIKE I WAS DRIVING IN DEEP SAND.  I COULD NOT GO FAST ENOUGH FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT FROM LOW GEAR.  THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS LIT ON THE DASH PANEL.  AFTER SITTING OVERNIGHT, IT APPEARED THAT THE CAR HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  ON FIRST INSPECTION THE DEALERSHIP WAS UNABLE TO FIND A PROBLEM.  I ENCOURAGED THEM TO CALL THE FACTORY FOR POSSIBLE ENGINEERING BULLETINS.  AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE SHOP I WAS INFORMED THAT THE FACTORY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO A FAULTY BRAKE BOOSTER WITH THE COST OF REPAIR ESTIMATED AT $800.  I HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM ABOUT 6-8 MONTHS PREVIOUSLY, WHICH HAD TOTALLY DISABLED THE VEHICLE AND IT HAD TO BE FLATBED TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO DEALER RESOLUTION SINCE, AFTER SITTING OVERNIGHT,  THEY COULDN'T GET THE  VEHICLE TO REPEAT THE SITUATION DURING TEST DRIVES.  I FEEL THAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON OUR LOCAL INTERSTATE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A MORE SERIOUS SITUATION, PARTICULARLY IF THE BRAKES HAD BOUND UP TIGHTLY, AND IT MAY BE A SAFETY-RELATED ISSUE WITH THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE.  *TR",

INABILITY TO OPEN THESE DOORS WITHOUT SUPPORT OF AN ADULT HAS CREATED CONCERN FOR A QUICK EXIT IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION FOR ALL PASSENGERS.

THE DOORS ARE HEAVY AND OFTEN TAKE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO HOLD THE (BLACK) RELEASE BUTTON DOWN TO OPEN THE DOOR(S).

THE BUTTON WHICH YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PUSH AND AUTOMATICALLY OPEN THE DOORS (FROM EITHER THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT OR THE BACK TWO REAR PASSENGER BUTTONS ARE NOT FUNCTIONAL).

IF A 9 YEAR OLD CHILD AND CHILDREN IN THEIR EARLY TEENS CANNOT OPEN THESE DOORS ON THEIR OWN, THIS PRESENTS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.

IN CHECKING THE FLUID LEVEL IT WAS DOWN A LITTLE.  CALLED DODGE 800-992-1997 TO REPORT OUR '06 GC SXT WITH 21,200 MILES, OBTAINED CASE # AND SETUP APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER TO \"DIAGNOSE PROBLEM\" $48.  DEALER STATED RNP NEEDED REPLACING FOR $1018.  I CHECKED WITH LOCAL O'REILLY AUTO PARTS AND COULD GET RNP FOR UNDER $300.  DODGE CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD PAY 40/60, THEM 40%, ME 60%.  I EXPLAINED TO REP THAT IF VEHICLE HAD 60~85K MILES I WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT AT LESS THAN 25K COME ON.  THEY REFUSED TO TAKE IT UP THE CHAIN AND ONLY OFFERED THE $400, SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I EXPLAINED IN MY RESEARCH THAT I FOUND NUMEROUS OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM UNDER THE 50K MARK.  NO LUCK WHAT SO EVER.  I EXPLAINED TO REP I COULD PURCHASE PART AND REPLACE IT CHEAPER - WHY SHOULD I PAY $600 (PARTS STORE WARRANTY LIFETIME).  GOING TO REPLACE IT MYSELF AND SAVE $600.  I FEEL DODGE SHOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE SINCE THIS IS A MANUFACTURING QUALITY ISSUE.  I AM TIRED OF HAVING FLUID ALL OVER MY CONCRETE DRIVE WAY.  THANKS DODGE, FOR NOTHING.  I AM SURPRISED DODGE DOES NOT EXPRESS ANY INTEREST IN MY SAFETY BEING MY STEERING COULD GO OUT ON MY WIFE AND CHILDREN THUS CAUSING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND PLACING THEM IN GRAVE DANGER WITH RESPECT TO LIFE, LIMB OR PROPERTY DAMAGE.

IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO DODGE CITY OF MILWAUKEE FOR TWO SERVICE APPOINTMENTS, ONE IN WINTER 2007 AND ANOTHER IN SPRING 2008.  DURING BOTH VISITS, I COMPLAINED OF AN PERSISTENT PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING SYSTEM.  ON SHARP LEFT TURNS, THE VAN OFTEN MAKES A \"PULSING\" OR \"HOWLING\" SOUND.  ON BOTH OCCASIONS, DODGE CITY OF MILWAUKEE FIXED SOMETHING IN THE STEERING SYSTEM, BUT THE SOUND NEVER WENT AWAY.  EARLIER TODAY, AS I WAS PULLING INTO THE ALLEY BEHIND MY HOUSE, THE CAR'S STEERING SUDDENLY FROZE AND THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON.  I AM NOT SURE OF THE REASON FOR THIS, BUT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY TRAFFIC, OR IF I WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.  I CHECKED THE OIL, WHICH WAS A BIT LOW BUT STILL IN THE NORMAL RANGE (I ALSO COMPLAINED ON BOTH VISITS THAT THE CAR LOSES OIL QUICKLY AND WAS ASSURED BY DODGE CITY OF MILWAUKEE THAT THIS IS NORMAL).  I SHUT OFF THE CAR, TURNED IT ON AGAIN, AND IT SEEMED TO WORK NORMALLY.  SINCE THE STEERING WAS AFFECTED, I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THIS INCIDENT IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR TECHNICIANS NEGLIGENTLY FAILED TO ADDRESS.    WHEN I PURCHASED  A NEW DODGE VAN IN 2006 FOR MY FAMILY OF SIX, I NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD CAUSE ME TO FEAR FOR OUR SAFETY WITHIN TWO YEARS.  THIS IS AN ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FAILURE OF DODGE CITY OF MILWAUKEE'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT I REPEATEDLY MENTIONED.    I AM COPYING MY LAWYER ON THIS MESSAGE, ALONG WITH THE WILDE DODGE SALESMAN WHO ORIGINALLY SOLD ME THE CAR, AND I ALSO PLAN TO INFORM THE NATIONAL CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  IF THE PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR IS TOO OBSCURE TO IDENTIFY, THEN I SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH A NEW VEHICLE THAT WILL NOT PUT MY FOUR SMALL CHILDREN AT RISK. *TR",

THE DRIVER'S  DOOR WAS PUSHING ME FROM BEHIND, AND I HAD TO WALK FORWARD TO KEEP THE DOOR FROM KNOCKING ME DOWN.  I TRIED TO REACH THE BRAKE WITH MY LEFT HAND OR JUMP INTO THE VEHICLE SO I COULD BRAKE. BEING PUSHED BY THE DOOR PREVENTED THIS. THE REAR WHEELS ROLLED OVER THE CURB FOLLOWED BY THE FRONT TIRES.  I  DESPERATELY TRIED TO PREVENT THE VAN FROM ROLLING INTO THE STREET BY GRABBING THE STEERING WHEEL AND TURNING IT A LITTLE.  THE SLIGHT UPSLOPE OF THE ROAD SLOWED THE VEHICLE DOWN ENOUGH FOR ME TO JUMP IN. I PUT THE KEY INTO THE IGNITION, STARTED THE VEHICLE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND PUT IT IN DRIVE.  I MOVED FORWARD SLIGHTLY, HITTING THE CURB, PUT IT INTO REVERSE AND DROVE BACK A BIT TO CLEAR THE CURB, PUT IT BACK INTO DRIVE AND DROVE BACK UP ONTO THE PARKING AREA.
