        "summary": "My wife has been feeling ill after being in our 2020 Nissan Rogue over the past year.  We had noticed a very bad smell when it was first started about 7 months after owning it. It was purchased new with only 4 miles on it.  The milage now is just under 14k   We did some research and found out that we should look at the cabin air filter.   When we removed it we found it to be covered with Black Mold.   I replaced it and about 3 months later we were having the same issue.   We had wrote to the Corporate office and CEO  our letter and case was given to Madison an Executive Specialist our case number is Case #45577085 and her direct number is 615-725-7752   we were asked to meet with Paul Smith at Crown Nissan Greenville SC  which we did.  We also met with Ryan Baughman the Serice Director.   They want to replace the entire system even though they did not see any obvious issues.   That date has not been confirmed as the parts were not available at that time.   The problem is that my wife is unable to be in her new car for any extended amount to time.   I worry that Nissan is at one point going to tell us there in nothing more they can or will do.   at age 68 we have never had any issue like this in all the vehicles that we have owned in Year Past.   They suggested that once the new systems is installed that they would install a Carbon Filter.   After a considerable amount to research we are not the only ones with this type of issue, but beyond that the bottom line is my wife feels ill after a short time inside this car which was bought for her.   Any help would be greatly appreciated",
