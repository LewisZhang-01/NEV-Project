They knew about this defective engine problem but they did not recall the vehicle.  Instead they extended the engine warranty to 10 years or 120,000 miles.  I have only 90,000 miles on my vehicle but I've owned it for over 10 years and now the check engine light is illuminated. The Cadillac dealer refuses to extend the warranty. This is a safety issue because if the engine were to fail the driver would also lose power steering and power brakes putting the safety of the vehicle occupants and others at risk. I believe that this vehicle and other GM vehicles with the 3.6 liter engine should be recalled and repaired at no cost to the vehicle owner.",

SUMMARY    GM IS RECALLING 4,586 MY 2008 CADILLAC STS AND STS-V PASSENGER VEHICLES FOR FAILING TO CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD NO. 138, 'TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEMS' (TPMS).

WHEN I PURCHASED THIS CAR I BOUGHT IT USED HOWEVER IT STILL HAD THE REMAINING MANUFACTURES POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. IT HAD 51,554 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. ON FEB 9, 2011 I REPORTED TO HERITAGE CADILLAC IN BELAIR MD. THAT I HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMING ON AND THAT I WANT TO HAVE THAT TAKE CARE OF BEFORE THE WARRANTY RAN OUT. WHEN I TOOK THE CAR THERE I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THE LIGHT HAD WENT OUT BEFORE I GOT THERE, THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD TELL WHAT WAS WRONG WHICH I FOUND OUT TO BE FALSE BECAUSE MONTHS LATER THEY WERE IN FACT ABLE TO CHECK IT WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BEING OFF. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT I HAVE TAKE MY CAR BACK TO HERITAGE CADILLAC 10 TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND I HAVE PAID THEM $4,212.08 (TO MAINTAIN AND ALLEGEDLY REPAIR THE PROBLEM OF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT) TODAY IS NOVEMBER 15, 2012 AND THE LIGHT IS STILL ON. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND THAT THEY HAD TO CONTACT A CADILLAC MANUFACTURE TO GET INFORMATION BUT I WILL HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER $3,100 TO FIX THE PROBLEM WHICH MAY BE FUEL INJECTORS AND A TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE. I FEEL THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN THIS SITUATION BY A CERTIFIED CADILLAC SERVICE CENTER. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT IT TO THEIR ATTENTION WHEN THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR",
