        "summary": "2008 Smart Fortwo Pure, currently with 85,036 miles, factory equipped with optional POWER STEERING - ELECTRIC, power steering had worked fine until Fall 2020 when cold temperatures caused steering lock-up, until car interior warmed enough to unlock steering, behavior consistent throughout that winter. Once steering unlocked, steering was normal, until car sat & chilled sufficiently to re-lock steering, or fault disappeared with warmer Spring 2021 temperatures. NEW DEVELOPMENTS - December 2021, outside temperatures in the 20s F, it takes much longer, 30-60 minutes or longer with heat & blower on max heat, before steering unlocks. After steering unlocks, it can seem fully unlocked, BUT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND FRIGID TEMPERATURES STEERING NOW GETS DANGEROUSLY STIFF AND STICKY AND STUCK-IN-POSITION MOMENTARILY WHILE DRIVING. Unlike some vehicles with steering lockable by key position for theft deterrence, THERE IS NO STEERING-LOCK-BASED ANTI-THEFT FEATURE ON THE FORTWO. I hope you\u2019ll agree that any vehicle whose steering may lock-up in operation at highway speeds as a function of U.S. midwestern winter temperatures has a life-threatening steering safety defect worthy of further investigation.",

THE RECALL WAS FOR A SAGGING INSULATION MAT IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, WHICH HAD APPARENTLY CAUSED FIRES IN OTHER SMART CARS. I CONTACTED MY DEALER, KEELER OF LATHAM, WHO TOLD ME THE PARTS WERE NOT IN FOR THE REPAIR, AND SUGGESTED I CALL MERCEDES, THE MANUFACTURER. I CALLED THEM, GAVE MY UPDATED ADDRESS, THEY TOLD ME THEY'D BE IN TOUCH WHEN THE RECALLED PARTS WERE AVAILABLE. I HAD MY CAR SERVICED FOR AN UNRELATED REASON A MONTH OR SO LATER, THEY NEVER CHECKED MY VEHICLE TO SEE IF THE RECALLED PARTS WERE AFFECTED. I ASKED ABOUT IT, THEY TOLD ME THE PARTS WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MERCEDES STATING THE RECALL FIX WAS NOT READY BUT THAT IT WAS SAFE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR. ON 7/31/18, MY CAR CAUGHT FIRE. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN, BUT ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER I PARKED THE CAR AT MY FRIEND'S HOME, HIS WIFE CAME INSIDE AND SAID \"YOUR FRIEND'S CAR IS ON FIRE\". WE WENT OUTSIDE, SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. MY CAR IS NOW TOTALED. THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS HURT. INSURANCE WILL PAY FOR PART OF WHAT IT WOULD COST TO GET ME INTO A NEW USED CAR, BUT MERCEDES HAS OFFERED ONLY TO PAY MY $500 DEDUCTIBLE, OR TO TAKE A SMALL DISCOUNT OFF MY PURCHASE OF A MERCEDES OR SMART CAR FROM AN AUTHORIZED MERCEDES DEALER. MERCEDES HAS ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRE, AS THEIR INVESTIGATION SHOWED IT WAS CAUSED BY THE SAGGING INSULATION MAT. I WAS HOPING THAT SOMETHING IN THE LAW WOULD HELP FORCE MERCEDES TO MAKE ME WHOLE. I JUST WANT TO BE BACK IN A RELIABLE USED CAR WITHOUT A CAR PAYMENT. IF THEY HAD REPAIRED THE RECALL IN A TIMELY MANNER, I WOULD STILL HAVE MY CAR, WHICH WAS IN GREAT SHAPE AND HAD NO PAYMENT. I DON'T WANT TO BUY A NEW MERCEDES CAR. I THOUGHT I SHOULD REPORT THIS.

I GOT OUT TO LOOK AND THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE QUICKLY INCREASED AND WAS COMING OUT THROUGH THE REAR BODY PANEL SECTIONS. I HAVE VIDEO OF THIS. I OPENED THE HATCH ON THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND SMOKE POURED OUT. I CALLED THE MECHANIC WHO IMMEDIATELY CAME AND DROVE IT BACK TO THE SHOP (NOT SURE WHY HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A SAFE THING TO DO?) THEY REPORTED THAT THE FIRE WALL FIRE INSULATION WAS DETERIORATING AND A LARGE CHUNK HAD FALLEN DOWN ONTO THE ENGINE AND WAS SMOLDERING.

NIGHT WE NOTICED A STEADY STREAM OF GAS POURING OUT OF THE VEHICLE UNDER THE CAR NEAR THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THE GAS ONLY STREAMED OUT WHEN THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE MERCEDES BENZ\\SMART CAR DEALER LOCATED NEAREST TO ME.     AFTER THE CAR WAS TOWED I STARTED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ONLINE TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE.

WHAT I WAS EVEN MORE STARTLED TO FIND WAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT VIDEOS OF SMART CARS CATCHING ON FIRE. I SOON DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS AN OPEN INVESTIGATION WITH THE NHTSA FOR ENGINE FIRES ON MODEL 2008-2009 FORTWO SMART CARS. THE INVESTIGATION NUMBER IS PE-16-016    THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME TODAY AND STATED THAT THE FUEL PUMP IS LEAKING GAS ON TOP OF THE TANK AND THAT THE FUEL PUMP WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. THEY HAVE NOT DROPPED THE FUEL TANK YET. THEY WITNESSED THE FUEL LEAK USING A MIRROR. IT IS NOW FRIDAY AT 2:15PM PST, AND TO LATE FOR THEM TO START REPAIRING THE FUEL PUMP TODAY.

I TYPICALLY DRIVE 4,500 TO 5,000 MILES PER MONTH AND MY FORD F-150 WAS USING APPROXIMATELY 26 GALLONS OF FUEL PER DAY AT A COST OF $4.25 PER GALLON.  THIS DUE DILIGENCE INCLUDED MEETING WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER OF SMART CENTER SEATTLE AND GIVING HIM A FULL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WORK I WOULD BE DOING AND DETERMINING HOW I THOUGHT THE CAR WOULD HOLD UP.  WE EVEN MEASURED THE CLEARANCE OF A SHOWROOM CAR WHICH WAS ACCEPTABLE.  I WAS SCHEDULED FOR A TEST DRIVE AND WAS COMPLETELY SOLD ON THE CAR AND THE BENEFITS OF UTILIZING THIS VEHICLE IN MY PROFESSION.  I ORDERED A CAR AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD TAKE UP TO 15 MONTHS BEFORE MY CAR WOULD BE BUILT AND DELIVERED.      THERE IS A PROGRAM WHERE THE DEALERSHIP CAN SELL CARS THAT WERE ORDERED AND NOT PURCHASED FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER.  THE CAR I EVENTUALLY PURCHASED WAS ONE OF THESE CARS.  I WAS CALLED TO SEE IF I WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD OF WAITING THE MONTHS FOR MY CAR TO BE MANUFACTURED.  WITH THE CURRENT COST OF FUEL AT THE TIME, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE CAR AND SURPLUS MY ORDERED CAR WHEN IT CAME INTO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE COST OF THE VEHICLE WAS $17,000.00 PLUS THE DEALER PREP, TAX AND SO ON, FOR A TOTAL PRICE OF $19,000.   THE VEHICLE HAD A STANDARD 24,000 MILE WARRANTY AND I WAS GIVEN THE OPTION TO PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR AN ADDITIONAL FEE, APPROXIMATELY $2000 IF I RECALL CORRECTLY.  BECAUSE OF THE HIGH MILEAGE I DRIVE EACH YEAR, APPROXIMATELY 70,000 MILES, I DECIDE. *TR",

THE CONSUMER SUSPECTED THAT WHEN THE COMPUTER WAS AT A  PARTICULAR CYCLE POINT IN ITS SERIES OF SYSTEMS CHECKS, IT WAS WAITING FOR A SIGNAL FROM SOME SENSOR WHICH WAS NOT RECEIVED WHEN THE POWER TO THE PARTICULAR SENSOR WAS SHUT OFF PRIOR TO THE COMPUTER WARNING SYSTEM POWERING OFF. THE SECOND ISSUE INVOLVED THE INTERMITTENT WIPER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE ON THE LINE B38 TO THE SAM CONTROL UNIT. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS, THE WIPERS WOULD GO THROUGH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A START UP ROUTINE OF 5 RAPID WIPES FOLLOWED BY 3 SLOW WIPES AND THEN RETURN TO OPERATING AS DESIGNED. OCCASIONALLY, THE ISSUE WAS CORRECTED BY TURNING THE WIPERS TO THE OFF POSITION AND BACK TO INTERMITTENT, BUT IT DIDN'T ALWAYS CORRECT THE PROBLEM.
