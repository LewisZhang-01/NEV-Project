        "summary": "This is with regards to a major safety incident that could have been fatal for my wife and  others on 2/2/2022. My wife parked her 2018 Kia Sorento on our driveway  picked up her belongings and closed the door of the car. As she was about to enter the house it felt to her that the car was still running. So, she went to the car again opened the drivers side of the door and reached out and pressed the \"Start/Stop\" button thinking if the car's engine is still \"ON\" it will turn it \"OFF\". As soon as she hit the button the car started rolling backwards and my wife got entangled in the door. She got knocked down to the ground sustaining a concussion on her head and deep bruises on her legs and shoulder. The car went to neighbor's front yard across the street and was stopped by the curb and the snow bank on neighbor's yard.  After I tended to my wife I went to fetch the car I double checked and saw that the gear shifter was in \"Parking\" position. The mystery is how the car moved backwards while the car was in \"Parking\". It's not a steep hill and the way car rolled it felt to my wife as the car was in \"Neutral\". There is no warning lights or any other failure indications.  We took the car to local Kia dealer for thorough inspection but they couldn't find anything. We are quite scared to drive the car. I am hoping a very through investigation of the car and get to the bottom of the issue.   We complained to Kia, they reached out once after almost a month and now radio silence on the issue.",

I decided to buy my 2018 KIA Sorento (from a different state) in August 2021 because I thought KIAs were safe and reliable cars. My KIA began to oil leak right before September 2021. I had it checked for oil leak and got my oil topped off. There was no oil leak detected. In November 2021, my engine light comes on. I believed it to be an indication it was time for an oil change. The night before I could even make it to the car shop my KIA begins to make a loud knocking sound. I got my oil change and the knocking still persist. The mechanic gentlemen tell me that I needed a crankshaft position sensor replacement. I drive my KIA to the nearest KIA dealership and they keep my KIA Sorento over the weekend because of the shortage in workers. The following Monday KIA dealership calls to say I needed a full replacement engine (motor). I haven't had my KIA for even four months and it is under 100,000 miles. I have never had to receive such gut wrenching news about any car I have brought! I pick up my car to park it immediately. There has been over thousands of recalls on KIA motors I was and still am frightened my engine (motor) could catch fire anytime. I am scared to even start it to keep my battery alive. KIA dealerships will not offer me any help because I am the second ownwer of this KIA. I definitely will NEVER buy a KIA car again or even HYDAUI car.",

Shortly after we began noticing the smell of gas, one day after re-fueling when I went to put the gas cap back on I noticed that the cap went back on but it wouldn\u2019t make that signature clicking sound that lets you know it\u2019s properly in place and sealed properly so we purchased a replacement one from the dealership thinking/hoping that would fix the issue but it hasn\u2019t. In fact just before purchasing the gas cap from the dealership we purchased a replacement from Autozone and it was the wrong one. It appeared to fit for the most part (or so we thought) but it was definitely the wrong one and because it was dark when we got the cap we couldn\u2019t see just how poorly it fit (plus you had to look from the bottom of the cap to be able to see the white plastic of the bottom of the cap was still exposed) so we ended up having to use it until the following day when we could get to the dealership to get the right one. Well while we had the wrong gas cap in it cause the check engine light to come on (which at least we know that works, lol) but oddly enough the car was getting better fuel mileage so I\u2019m thinking that because having the proper gas cap seals the system properly it could be causing it to leak more or worse because since putting the right cap on, while it did help the check engine light go off I\u2019m not getting very good gas mileage at all. I\u2019m going to take it to a shop and hopefully they can figure out what is going on with it (when we\u2019re able to pay what I\u2019m assuming will be a pretty heft shop bill) but I just wanted to let it be known and I will send a follow up message letting you know what came of the shop fix/inspection.

WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF HAVING THE VEHICLE, BRAND NEW OFF THE LOT, THE ENGINE NOISES (TAPPING/KNOCKING) WERE NOTICED BY A FAMILY MEMBER. IT WAS REPORTED TO KIA WITHIN THE FIRST 3,500 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, WHO ADVISED ME INITIALLY THAT THE SOUNDS WERE BECAUSE THE ENGINE WAS NEW AND BREAKING IN AND THAT THE SOUNDS WERE NORMAL. IN JANUARY 2019, I WAS ADVISED WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR THEIR COURTESY INSPECTION THAT THERE WAS A RECALL AND THEY NEEDED TO PERFORM A SOFTWARE UPDATE ON THE VEHICLES ECM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TURN THE VEHICLE INTO LIMP MODE TO WARN THE DRIVER OF A POTENTIAL ENGINE FIRE BEFORE IT HAPPENS. KIA PERFORMED THE UPDATE AND THE ENGINE NOISES STILL PERSIST. THE TECHNICIAN CLAIMED HE INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND REPORTED THAT IT WAS PERFORMING AS INTENDED AND THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE. LATELY THE NOISES HAVE BEEN MORE FREQUENT, SO AS A SAFETY CONCERN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK INTO KIA FOR INSPECTION. NOW THE DEALERSHIP AND MANUFACTURER INSTEAD OF CHECKING AND CONFIRMING THE SAFENESS OF THE VEHICLE, IS BLAMING AN AFTERMARKET OIL FILTER AND SYNTHETIC OIL AS THE CAUSE OF THE ENGINE ISSUES, NOT THEIR ENGINE ISSUES THAT RECALLED THOUSANDS OF CARS AND RESULTED IN ENGINE FIRES. MOREOVER, KIA NOT ONLY REFUSES TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC REPORT AND SUPPOSEDLY OIL PRESSURE TEST THAT THEY CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN PERFORMED THAT GAVE THEM THOSE RESULTS, THEY ALSO REFUSE TO CONFIRM TO WHETHER THE CAR IS SAFE TO BE ON THE ROAD. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD; ENGINE FIRES ARE REAL WHICH CAN SEVERELY INJURE OR KILL THE OCCUPANTS OF A VEHICLE. THE MANUFACTURER AND THE DEALER REFUSE TO ADDRESS THIS HAZARD AND IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED, FOR CONSUMER SAFETY.",

THESE TUBS WERE CONNECTED TO THE CARGO CARRIER WITH BUNGIE CORDS.     WE HAD PLANNED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS AND AFTER A 5-HOUR DRIVE, WE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL & WE NOTICED THAT THE TUB ON THE BOTTOM STARBOARD SIDE HAD BEEN BURNED SIGNIFICANTLY. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, WE LEARNED THAT THE EXHAUST PIPE WAS PART OF THE BUMPER SYSTEM AND THAT IT HAD HEATED THE ONE TUB AND THE CARGO CARRIER TO SUCH HIGH TEMPERATURES AS TO CAUSE A FIRE INSIDE THE TUB. IT HAD MELTED THE TUB TO THE CARGO CARRIER AND BURNED A BIG HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE TUB. THE SUITCASE INSIDE THE TUB HAD A HUGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SIDE AND ALL OF ITS CONTENTS WERE BURNED OR SCORCHED. SINCE THE FIRE WAS NO LONGER BURNING, WE DECIDED TO NOT CALL THE LAS VEGAS FIRE DEPARTMENT AS THE THREAT WAS OVER.    THE NEXT DAY, BEFORE WE LEFT LAS VEGAS, WE WENT TO HOME DEPOT AND FOUND SOME MATERIALS AND CRAFTED AN ALUMINUM SHIELD TO BLOCK THE EXHAUST FROM HITTING THE CARGO CARRIER.

THROUGH OUR ASSESSMENT, WE DETERMINED THAT THE DAMAGES DONE TO THE CARGO CARRIER, THE BUNGIE CORDS, THE TUB, THE SUITCASE AND ALL OF ITS (MOSTLY BRAND NEW) CONTENTS TO BE ABOUT $1547.15.
