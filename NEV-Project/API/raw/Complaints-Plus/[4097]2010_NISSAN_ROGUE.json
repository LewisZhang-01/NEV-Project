The summer of 2014 Rogue started a whining noise going up hills or under a light load.  There was no other indication from the vehicle that it was under distress, no warning lights appeared etc. Dealership mechanic test drove and confirmed the CVT was failing. 6/13/2014; Mileage 44228 per Warranty, installed: \"1-Transaxle Assy; 1-Trans Exchange Expense; 5- NS-2 CVT TRANMI; 1Tranmission CO; 1 Cooler Kit-AUTO.\" \"Certified concern, per Tech Line replaced CVT Transmission Assembly, Programmed TCM, Installed Transmission cooler, operates per design.\"      The CVT was flushed and cleaned on 6/06/2018 at 78,882 by same dealership.   Miles since new CVT was replaced 44228 - 78882 = 34654      June 24, 2021 upon returning from a trip the car was not shifting properly.  At starting of an intersection the VOC light flashes and came on, and the car hardly would go across the intersection with the gas pedal pushed to floor.  There were times gear shifting would rev and not shift smoothly.  It was dangerous doing only 55mph in a 75 mph on I-10 returning. On July 22, 2021; Mileage 92762; took to dealership for digonostic; they reported: \"caused by check codes and A/B counts no code present. Transmission has B counts recommend transmission replacement.\" \"CVT Assembly $4890; front lower control arms if done at time of CVT $650 & drive belt $180.\".   And, of course, they informed me that the Warranty expired 1 year to the month.   However,it is my understanding that 2010 Rogue were given an extended 10 year warranty/150k.    My Warrenty book indicates differently.    I believe Nissan's Warranty on my specific vehicle is misleading and needs reviewed.  And may be considered fraudelant. A 2010 Nissan Rogue has less than 94,000 miles 1 CVT replaced prematurely now requiring another new CVT transmission replaced. North America Nissan denied asst beyond warranty",

IT WOULD BE $2300 JUST FOR THE PART TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT WAS BEING TOLD TO ME.  I CONTACTED THE NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPT.

IF A FAMILY OF 4 IS IN THE CAR AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR  THE VEHICLE COULD GO INTO \"LIMP\" MODE AND WHEN THEY TRY TO PULL BACK ONTO THE HIGHWAY THEY COULD LOSE POWER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND GET STRUCK BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND BE KILLED.  WHO WOULD ANSWER FOR THAT? FLETCHER NISSAN IN JOPLIN MO ARE THE ONES WHO TOLD ME TO CONTACT YOU BECAUSE NISSAN CORPORATE ARE THE ONES REFUSING TO FIX THE ISSUE.  IT HAS HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES IN OUR CAR. AT FIRST THEY SAID WE JUST NEEDED THE TRANSMISSION FLUSHED. WE BOUGHT THE CAR WITH 10000 MILES ON IT AND IT HAS BEEN DOING IT EVER SINCE WE HAVE HAD IT. LUCKILY I KNEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND KEPT MY FAMILY OUT OF HARMS WAY.  JOSH HOUCHIN THE SERVICE MGR. AT FLETCHER NISSAN SAID THEY HAVE HAD 5 2008-2010 ROUGE VEHICLES COME IN IN JUST THE LAST FEW MONTHS WITH THE SAME DEFECT. SO IT IS NOT JUST MY VEHICLE.

THE WHINING SOUND AND VIBRATION ARE NORMAL I WAS TOLD.  AFTER GOING TO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS MULTIPLE TIMES AND TALKING WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, IN DECEMBER 2016 I WAS FINALLY TOLD THAT THERE'S NO EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE BECAUSE NISSAN CANCELED MY CAR'S WARRANTY BACK IN 2014 BECAUSE OF A BRANDED TITLE.

THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE HILL WAS 70 MPH.  EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCKS WERE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND MY ROGUE FORCING ME TO PULL ONTO THE ROAD SHOULDER ALLOWING THEM TO GO PAST.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A LOCAL NISSAN DEALER WHO CONFIRMED FROM EXAMINATION OF THE CAR CPU THAT  THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATED  AND THAT AN OVERHEAT CODE WAS FOUND IN THE CPU.  THEY ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE FAIL SAFE WAS ACTIVATED THAT CAUSED THE SEVERE POWER LOSS.  THE NISSAN DEALER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS FROM MY DESCRIPTION.  NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND EVEN EXTENDED MY TRANSMISSION CVT WARRANTY FROM  6YR/60,000 MILES TO 10YR/120,000 MILES.  HOWEVER, THEIR SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO INSTALL AN AUXILIARY  CVT TRANSMISSION FLUID COOLER AT AN EXPENSE TO ME OF $1225.

THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!  I BROUGHT ME VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP 2 TIMES AND AS A RESULT THEY SUGGESTED TO INSTALL A \"COOLER KIT\" BY NISSAN WHICH POTENTIALLY CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM JUST BY COOLING THE CVT IS A \"BETTER\" WAY. THEY ARE ASKING FOR ABOUT $1200 FOR THE INSTALLATION. I SEE THAT AS A NISSAN'S DESIGN FLOW. I DON'T THINK PAYING FOR THIS OUT OF MY POCKET IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION. I THINK NISSAN SHOULD START A RE-CALL ON THAT PROBLEM. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION ON HOW NISSAN HANDLES IT RIGHT NOW (IN FACT IT DOESN'T HANDLE IT  ALL). THANK YOU.

I REFUSE TO PAY OUT OF MY POCKET FOR ANOTHER TRANSMISSION; WHICH HAS NOT AIDED OTHERS IN THIS SAME SITUATION. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR A YEAR.

WHILE GOING UP A HILL AT 75MPH (SPEED LIMIT IN THAT STATE), THE CRUISE CONTROL CUT OFF, AND VEHICLE LOST POWER, AND RPM'S WOULD NOT EXCEED 2500 RPM AND WOULD NOT GO OVER 60MPH, WHICH EVERY TIME I HIT A HILL, WOULD DECREASE TO 40MPH. THIS HAPPENED 3 TIMES IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS, WHERE RPM'S WOULD NOT EXCEED 2500 RPM, WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN SEMI-TRUCKS ARE BEHIND YOU. A SEARCH ONLINE STATED THIS WAS THE TRANSMISSION GOING INTO FAIL-SAFE MODE, ALTHOUGH THE DEALERSHIP STATED NO, BECAUSE A CODE WOULD COME BACK.   FOR ALMOST A YEAR, I WOULD NOT TAKE MY CAR OUT OF TOWN FOR WORK, FOR FEAR THIS WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN. DECIDED TO TAKE IT ON A LONG ROAD TRIP THIS AUGUST, AND AGAIN, THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED. THIS TIME, THE ONLY WAY TO GET RPM'S AND MPH'S BACK, WAS TO PULL OVER AND LET THE CAR SIT FOR 20 MINUTES OR SO. IT WOULD THEN DRIVE NORMAL FOR ANYWHERE FROM 30 MIN-1 HOUR, BEFORE LOOSING POWER AGAIN. TOOK IT INTO DEALERSHIP UPON ARRIVING HOME, AND THIS TIME, THERE IS A BULLETIN FOR THE TRANSMISSION FLUID OVERHEATING, AND IT NEEDS A COOLER, TO THE TUNE OF $1,400 AND IS 2 MONTHS BACKORDERED. I WAS TOLD THIS PROBLEM WOULD ONLY OCCUR ON LONG ROAD TRIPS, AND I WOULD BE FINE TAKING IT ON A 5 HR TRIP THAT WEEKEND.   COME 3 DAYS LATER, 45 MINUTES INTO THE TRIP, THE CRUISE CONTROL CUT OFF, BEGAN BLINKING, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AND RPM'S DECREASED TO BTWN 2000-2500. PULLED OVER TO LET IT COOL, AND THEN IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE OVER 40MPH ON THE HIGHWAY. DECIDED TO TURN BACK AROUND, AND 3 TIMES ON THE WAY HOME (APPX. EVERY 15 MINUTES), I LOST ALL POWER. THE CAR WAS STILL RUNNING, BUT THE RPM'S WOULD NOT GO OVER 0, AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. HAD TO LET IT SIT FOR 15-20 MINUTES EACH TIME, AND THEN WAS ABLE TO DRIVE 15 MIN, BEFORE LOOSING ALL POWER AGAIN.

THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WHEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF ~70-80 MPH, THE VEHICLE WOULD NO LONGER ACCELERATE EVEN WHEN THE GAS PEDAL WAS PRESSED TO THE FLOOR.  THE FIRST INCIDENT HAPPENED WHILE THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ENGAGED BUT THE 2ND AND 3RD INCIDENTS OCCURRED WITH AND WITHOUT CRUISE CONTROL ENGAGED. ON THE 2ND AND 3RD INCIDENTS, WHEN WE EXITED THE HIGHWAY AND CAME TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT WE ALSO EXPERIENCED AN ACCELERATION ISSUE WHEN STARTING FROM A STOPPED POSITION.  IN THESE INSTANCES, I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL BUT THE CAR DID NOT MOVE FORWARD, FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS, AND THEN SPUTTERED BEFORE FINALLY ACCELERATING NORMALLY.    AFTER THE SECOND INCIDENT I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM, ONLINE, AND SAW NUMEROUS POSTS WITH OTHER ROGUE OWNERS HAVING SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL PROBLEMS.

I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO JAY, OUR SERVICE ADVISOR, WHO HAD A TECHNICIAN CHECK OUT THE CAR.  HE SAID A TRANSMISSION CODE, <P0744>, CAME UP IN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  HOWEVER, NISSAN INSTITUTED A NEW POLICY ON THAT DATE WHICH REQUIRED THE DEALERSHIP REPLICATE THE PROBLEM BEFORE NISSAN WOULD AUTHORIZE THE REPLACEMENT.  THE DEALER COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH LOCAL DRIVING AND WOULD NOT ALLOW A TECH TO TAKE IT ON A LONG TRIP.  I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUT THEY WERE NO HELP.

DEALER IS NOT TAKING IT BACK AND I'VE NOW HAD THIS TROUBLED CAR 20 DAYS BUT THEY WON'T ADMIT IT'S DEFECTIVE. THEY SAID THEY CAN CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION BUT ONLY BECAUSE ITS UNDER WARRANTY.

THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE, THEY DO NOT WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS THE CVT NEW TRANSMISSION.

I TOOK MY CAR FOR CHANGE OIL AND THE NISSAN SERVICE DID A REPROGRAM TO ELIMINATE THE NOISE. THE NOISE HAD LESSENED. THINKING THAT IT IS A BRAND NEW CAR, I DID AN OBSERVATION AND WAITED FOR MY SECOND CHANGE OIL AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE NOISE IN MY CAR AGAIN AND THE BRAKE THAT FELT LIKE IT'S LOSING A THREAD WHEN YOU STEP ON IT. AFTER MY CHANGE OIL, I WAS TOLD THAT MY TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, THE DEALER HAS TO ORDER IT AND WILL CALL ME BACK IN 2-3 DAYS. A WEEK HAD PASSED AND I DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL. I CALLED NISSAN USA TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SERVICE AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR KNOWING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE BREAK AND THE TRANSMISSION. I CALLED BACK AGAIN AND THE SERVICE AGENT JUST TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT YET IN. I WAS DRIVING IN THE RAIN WHEN THE ACCELERATOR JUST KEPT GOING EVEN IF I WAS NOT PRESSING ON IT. I WAS CONCERNED AND TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND WAS GIVEN A RENTAL CAR. I BOUGHT A FULLY LOADED CAR BUT WAS GIVEN A LEMON CAR. I COULD'VE BEEN DEAD BY NOW IF I AM STILL DRIVING THAT CAR FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IF THE ACCELERATOR AND BRAKE WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED. I KEPT CALLING NISSAN BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RESPONSE. ONE OF THE SALES IN THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS THE 3RD ROGUE 2010 TRANSMISSION PROBLEM THAT WAS REPORTED IN THE SAME PLACE. A VERY UNSAT COSTUMER SERVICE AND DEALER SERVICES BY LETTING AN UNSAFE CAR TO BE ON THE ROAD! *TR",
