ATTACHED IS MY EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS WITH ORCHID ISLE FORD, SINCE THEN.  IN SHORT, THEY HAVE NOT REPLACED MY AIRBAG AND I CANNOT SELL MY VEHICLE.      DEAR ORCHID ISLE,     BECAUSE OUR RANGER IS ALMOST 10 YEARS OLD AND IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE SUGGESTED WE SELL IT ON OUR OWN, WE HAVE PUT OUT SOME FEELERS.  UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY TAKATA AIRBAG, IT HAS CREATED A SITUATION FOR US IN SELLING THIS TRUCK.    ALMOST A YEAR AGO, I WROTE TO YOU AFTER RECEIVING THE RECALL NOTICE TWICE AND CALLED YOUR SERVICE DEPARTMENT, LIKE YOU SUGGESTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY COULD NOT HELP US THEN AND NOW, A YEAR LATER, THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PART.  WE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY BY TAKATA, WHICH SAYS WE ARE STILL SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE A FREE AIRBAG REPLACEMENT BY THE FORD DEALER THAT SOLD US THE VEHICLE AND IF NOT, THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA.  HERE IS OUR DILEMMA.  OUR VEHICLE THAT IS ALMOST 10 YEARS OLD, HAS ONLY 40,000 MILES ON IT.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF THE SHOWROOM AND YET, WE CANNOT SELL IT.  WE AGREE, WE COULD PROBABLY PASS IT OFF TO SOME UNSUSPECTING BUYER, BUT THAT WOULD BE UNETHICAL AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER IT.    CAN YOU PLEASE ASSIST US WITH THIS AIRBAG REPLACEMENT?
