THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON SO MUCH THAT IT'S HARD TO TELL WHEN THERE REALLY IS A PROBLEM.  RECENTLY MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON FOR ABOUT 9 MONTHS. THE MECHANIC CODES REVEALED THAT IT WAS RUNNING TOO \"RICH.\" I PUT IT ON \"NON-OPERABLE\" FOR REGISTRATION PURPOSES WHILE I AGAIN TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY. ONE DAY (ON A TEMPORARY MOVING PERMIT) I WENT TO GET GASOLINE AND FILLED THE TANK HALFWAY. A FEW MILES LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF, FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I WENT TO GET A SMOG CHECK, AND WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE FAIL POLICY AT THE STATION, THE ATTENDANT SAID, \"THESE TOYOTAS ALWAYS PASS THE EMISSIONS, AS LONG AS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ISN'T ON.\" HE WAS RIGHT, AND MY RAV4 PASSED WITH PERFECT EMISSIONS COMPLIANCE.  IN THE PAST I HAVE REPLACED MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER, ALL THE OXYGEN SENSORS, AND EVENTUALLY THE ENTIRE EXHAUST MANIFOLD IN ORDER TO GET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO GO OFF AND PASS A CA SMOG CHECK.   SOME YEARS AGO MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. IT WAS LEAKING OIL, AND MY MECHANIC SAID JUST TO MAKE SURE IT HAD ENOUGH OIL IN IT UNTIL I COULD AFFORD TO FIX THE \"LEAKY GASKETS.\" BUT THE PROBLEM WAS REALLY A FAULTY OIL PUMP, AND THE ENGINE SEIZED. I HAD A REBUILT ENGINE PUT IN, AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF. THE TOYOTA RAN FINE FOR 6 MONTHS. THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.   IN ALL OF THIS, TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE ACCEPTS NO FAULT. THEY SAY I SHOULD COMPLAIN TO NHTSA, AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RECALLS.  I HAVEN'T HAD SUCH AN UNRELIABLE CAR SINCE MY 1984 CHEVY CHEVETTE.

        "summary": "I'VE BEEN HAVING AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE WITH MY 2005 RAV 4.  WHEN EXITING A HIGHWAY  ON A SWEEPING RIGHT CURVE EXIT RAMP, THE VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT WILL START TO FLASH AND AN AUDIBLE BEEP CAN BE HEARD IN THE CABIN.  THIS USUALLY INDICATES THE CAR IS IN A SKID BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM IN FULL CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, IN ITS LANE.    AFTER 2 TO 3 SECONDS OF CONSTANT BEEPING THE ENGINE CUTS POWER AND APPLIES BRAKING TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHEEL, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LURCH SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE.    JUST AS QUICKLY AS THIS HAPPENS, THE CAR RESUMES NORMAL OPERATION AND THE ISSUE CEASES TO EXIST.   I HAVE HAD SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THIS VERY ISSUE IN THE PAST 2 MONTHS.   MOST HAPPEN AT SLOW SPEEDS (UNDER 35MPH) AND ON DRY PAVEMENT.  THE VEHICLE SUSPENSION AND ALIGNMENT ARE WITHIN OPERATING SPECIFICATION.   I HAVE NOTICED HOWEVER, THAT THE STEERING RACK BUSHINGS ARE WORN. THIS CAUSES THE ENTIRE RACK TO MOVE ABOUT SLIGHTLY WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF ITS MOUNT.  TO MY DISMAY, TOYOTA DOES NOT SELL REPLACEMENT BUSHINGS FOR THE STEERING RACK ON 2004-2005 MODEL RAV-4'S, FORCING OWNERS TO PAY FOR A COMPLETELY NEW STEERING RACK.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FROM A BRAND THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON RELIABILITY AND REASONABLY PRICED MAINTENANCE.    THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE IS COMPROMISED BY AN SUBSTANDARD ENGINEERED COMPONENTS. IE:  STEERING BUSHINGS; CAUSING TOO MUCH PLAY AND ALLOWING THE VEHICLE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM TO INADVERTENTLY ACTIVATE, CAUSING A DANGEROUS UNSETTLING OF THE VEHICLE.",

I WAS COMING HOME ONE DAY AND PROCEEDED ONTO A FREEWAY ONRAMP.  THE ROADS WERE WET BUT NOT EXCESSIVE.  I MADE THE TURN ONTO THE RAMP SHIFTED AND THE ACCELERATED, I FOUND AT THAT TIME THE TIRES WERE LOOSING TRACTION, SO I BACKED OFF THE ACCELERATOR.  I AM ALSO FINDING ON RIBBED FREEWAYS THAT THE CAR WILL NOT TRACK.  I RECENTLY WNET TO THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.   FROM HERE IT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OF DEALER TELLING ME TALK TO TOYOTA AND TOYOTA SAYING TALK TO TOYO.  DURING MY NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH TOYO, I WAS TOLD THAT THE TIRES WERE GRADED 300 BB. I ASKED IF THIS WAS PROBLEM, \"I DON'T KNOW\"  MY LAST CONVERSATION WITH TOYO I ASKED IF THE TIRE IS BB WHY DOES MY TIRE SAY AA.  THYE NEEDED TO RESEARCH AND NOT TO MY AMAZEMENT THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TIRE WAS AN AA AND THEY JUST FOUND OUT.  THEY FURTHER STATED THE TIRE USED TO BE BB BUT IN 2001 WAS UPGRADED TO AA.  \"MISCOMMUNICATION FROM TOYO JAPAN TO THEM.  HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE INJURED ETC.",
