AS THEY WERE REPAIRING THE FAULTY AIRBAG THEY CRACKED THE DASHBOARD AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT IT WOULD BE $300 TO FIX IT BECAUSE IT HAD A TINY CRACK IN IT. PLEASE NOTE THAT THEY WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK THE DASHBOARD OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. SUPER RUDE! I CALLED SUBARU OF AMERICA AND THEY DECIDED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE DASHBOARD. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT GLUING IT BACK TOGETHER LAST I HEARD I'M VERY MUCH HOPING THIS IS NOT THE CASE MY DAUGHTER ENSURES ME THAT IT ISN'T BUT WE'LL SEE. ALSO HE INFORMED ME THAT MY HEAD GASKETS WERE LEAKING AGAIN. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THIS IS COMMON ONCE YOU'VE HAD YOUR GASKETS REPLACED. THIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. MY CAR HAS ABOUT 160,000 MILES ON IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALREADY PLAYED OUT AND NOT SAFE. WHAT A JOKE. I'LL NEVER BUY A SUBARU AGAIN.THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST CAR AND APPARENTLY THE MOST UNSAFE CAR I'VE EVER OWNED. NOTE:THIS CAR WAS CONSISTENTLY UNSAFE WHILE DRIVING FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.

THE CAR WAS JUST BARELY MOVING DUE TO THE ENGINE IDLE.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  I DROVE AT THAT PACE TO A PARKING LOT TO CHECK MY OPTIONS.  I HAD NOT NOTED, UNTIL NOW, THAT THIS CAR HAS NO THROTTLE CABLE AND IS COMPLETELY DRIVE-BY-WIRE.  I LOOKED AT THE CONNECTION OF WIRE HARNESS TO THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY AND DID NOT SEE ANY RED FLAGS - NO CORROSION, ETC.  IT APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE. I SHUT THE CAR OFF, WAITED ABOUT 30 SEC, AND RESTARTED IT.  IT THEN GOT US HOME.    WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT, I RAN MY OBD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL AND GOT A P2138 ERROR CODE.  THIS IS LISTED AS \"THROTTLE/PEDAL POSITION SENSOR/SWITCH \"D\"/\"E\" VOLTAGE CORRELATION\" TROUBLE CODE DESCRIPTION.  I AM GOING TO CHECK INTO MY OPTIONS TOMORROW, BUT FELT THIS WAS WORTH REPORTING SINCE IT APPEARS THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM AS WELL.    THERE IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY CONCERN WITH A FAILURE OF THIS NATURE AS I WAS TRAVELING AT A GOOD RATE AND IN TRAFFIC.  LUCKILY, EVERYONE IS OK - BUT MY WIFE AND I WORRY WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.    THANKS.  *TR",

A FEW MINUTES LATER I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND THE  ACCELERATOR PEDAL SEEMED TO FUNCTION NORMALLY, ALTHOUGH THE TWO WARNING LIGHTS WERE STILL ILLUMINATED.  THE NEXT DAY I STARTED THE CAR A COUPLE OF TIMES, THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL FUNCTIONED NORMALLY AND BOTH WARNING LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER LIT.  THE CAR OPERATED NORMALLY FOR ABOUT ONE WEEK.  THIS INDENTICAL PROBLEM RECURRED AGAIN ONE WEEK AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT.  I DROVE MY 2006 OUTBACK TO MY INDEPENDENT SUBARU MECHANIC WHO READ THE ERROR CODE AS P2138.  HE HAS SEEN SEVERAL OF HIS CLIENT'S CARS WITH THIS PROBLEM RECENTLY AND RECOMMENDED THAT I TAKE MY CAR TO A SUBARU DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND REPAIR.  A FEW DAYS LATER I HAD MY OUTBACK SERVICED AT MY LOCAL SUBARU DEALER.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR (INTEGRAL TO THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY) AND CONFIRMED THE P2138 ERROR CODE.  THE PEDAL SENSOR WAS REPLACED AND (TWO DAYS LATER) THE CAR APPEARS TO BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY AGAIN.  THE REPAIR BILL WAS ABOUT $320 FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR.

THE JUMPS BETWEEN MARKINGS MAKE IT JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE TO QUICKLY DETERMINE THE SPEEDS 50, 60, AND 70  MPH AND FORGET TRYING FOR 55,65,75.
