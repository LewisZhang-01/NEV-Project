        "summary": "ON 5/17/2010 MY 1998 GEORGIE BOY MOTOR HOME EXPERIENCED TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE.  MY DAUGHTER, HER HUSBAND, AND BABY HAD JUST PULLED INTO THE DISNEY WORLD WHEN THE BRAKES FAILED COMPLETELY.  THERE WAS   SMOKE.  AFTER CALLING A MECHANIC THAT HAD TO COME AND FIX IT   ONSITE.  HE SAID THAT ALL BRAKE CALIPERS BURNED UP.  HE THOUGHT  IT WAS A WORKHOUSE CHASSIS SO I CALLED WORKHORSE.  THEY SAID  IT WAS A CHEVY CHASSIS.  I CALLED CHEVY AND THEY SAID THERE WERE  NO RECALLS AND THEY HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.  THE MECHANIC  HAS STATED IN A LETTER THAT HE SAW NO KIND OF USE OR RUST FAILURE.  HE HAS RECEIVED 2 MORE CALLS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WITH THE SAME  KIND OF FAILURE.  THE MECHANIC NAME WAS DAVE WITH FLORIDA  MOBILE RV.  TELEPHONE 407-518-6739.  HE HAS SENT ME A LETTER AND  MANY PICTURES OF THE BURNT CALIBERS.  HE BELIEVE THAT THE CHASSIS  WAS DEFECTED.  CHEVY SAID THEY HAD NO RECALLS ON MY VIN BUT I  GOT THE FEELING THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT IT.  I SPENT $3500. ON THE  REPAIRS.  EVEN WORSE THE MECHANIC SAID THEY WERE CLOSE TO HAVING   THE WHOLE COACH CATCH ON FIRE.  I BELIEVE CHEVY IS RESPONSIBLE  AND SHOULD HAVE TO PAY AND OTHERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS BEFORE  SOMEONE DIES. *TR",
