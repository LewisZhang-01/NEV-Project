THIS WILL HAPPEN AT ANY SPEED - BOTH ON THE HIGHWAY OR ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS. ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE HEADLIGHT/S COMPLETELY SHUTTING DOWN, THE PRECEDING FLICKERING CAN ALSO POSE A SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD AS IT MAY CONFUSE ONCOMING VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC. I HAVE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY FROM AUDI MANY TIMES. AND I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM EVEN AS IT OCCURS AS SOON AS I DRIVE AWAY. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND MANY SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH OTHER AUDI A4/S4 OWNERS. I FEEL THIS IS CAUSE FOR AUDI TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM AT THEIR EXPENSE WITH THE OBVIOUS SAFETY REASONS FOREMOST IN MIND AND WITH THE PREVALENT PROBLEM WHICH COULD SUGGEST A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM. *TR",
