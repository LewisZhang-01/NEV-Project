In fact, I had my brakes inspected by Honda at 33,000 miles, and Honda gave my brakes  a clean bill of health.    While driving my vehicle, the brake pedal suddenly was unable to be depressed except with extreme foot pressure; it felt like a brick had been placed under my brake pedal.  The stopping power was substantially diminished. It took multiple, very strong brake pumps to slow and stop my vehicle, meaning I was unable to stop in the event of an emergency.  I took the car immediately to a Honda dealership.    Ultimately, Honda replaced by brake booster, which they noted was defective, but charged me for the repair because the time (but not mileage) had elapsed on my warranty.",

This car has had multiple issues including AC problems and more recently a problem that causes the steering wheel to be sticking to a position after driving for a long distance (apparently worse on hot weather). I have brought this car multiple times to the dealership. Last year I was informed the issue was caused by something regarding the brake calipers, which were then replaced under warranty. As I'm working from home I have barely driven long distances until last month when I drove longer. Then I noticed the steering issue persists. I brought the car back to the Honda dealership (Serramonte Honda) and was then informed the issue NOW was due to a bad battery (my car never had battery issues) and the car also needed to do an alignment. I told Darren that it did not make any sense because if the issue was battery I would see it as soon as I start driving, and not after driving for awhile. Still, I said that I would take care of the 2 things and then check again. So I did, i installed a new battery (even after testing my battery with my multimeter at home and seeing it was ok) and did the alignment. I spent a little over $300 and took the car for a long drive and indeed the issue persisted. Then I drove right back to the dealership and talked with a service advisor again showing him the video of my car with the steering wheel stuck and changing lanes until I would run out of the road unless I intervene (I have it on video). I was hoping to get  a technician to get into the car and witness first hand. That was not possible. So after showing the video to the service advisor I left the car to be tested again.  A day later I received the call saying they can not reproduce the problem. I had called Honda, and my case number is 12390725. I've seen multiple cases of people describing the exact same issue, fo all the cases the fix has been replacing the power steering rack assembly ( part # 53560-TBA-A01)",

He was unaware that the had not placed the vehicle in park, as he was able to turn off engine and exit the car without sufficient safety warning. He  took an item from the trunk, closed it, walked down the street and into the house. A few minutes later our neighbor got an alert on her security camera. Our unoccupied car is seen in the video rolling forward, down the hill, before crashing into shrubs and trees at bottom.  When we got up to the car, my husband unlocked it and climbed in through passenger seat, to find it was still in drive, but was not running.This could have seriously injured or killed a child or anyone else if they had been standing in its path.Thankfully, it didn't roll into a child or one of our neighbors. No one was injured, though they certainly could have been. The car does have damage, but that can be fixed. We have not taken it to the dealer yet, but I am contacting them now. We have not contacted our insurance company yet. But we will be submitting the photos and videos with the claim.    My husband said there was not a warning light on the dash and he did not observe any indication that the car was still in gear or he would not have gotten out of the car.

This isn't to say it doesn't also happen in other circumstances, but in the situation mentioned it happens most often.  At times, it has been very difficult to correct the vehicle trajectory so as to prevent either running off the road in the direction of the curve or straying into another lane due to the corrective action needed.  Empirical evidence seems to suggest it occurs more frequently at higher ambient temperatures.  A dealer has inspected the vehicle, but the result was inconclusive.

We did take it in and were told we needed to pay for them to check it and see if it was covered under warranty. I then looked on line to find there was a lawsuit against Honda for the same thing. Then the California fires came, we drove the car with the windows down by force and it was hard with the heat and smoke, but had to do it to get to work and daily things, it was ugly we couldn't even take the kids with us.

ONE MONTH AND HALF PRIOR TO THIS HAPPEN, I TOOK MY CAR TO THE HONDA DEALER SERVICES TWICE AND ONLY WANT TO CHARGE ME WITH THINGS THAT THE WARRANTY DID NOT COVER AND COULD NOT TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR. HONDA DEALER SHOULD HAD KNOWN THE PROBLEMS MY CAR HAS ARE RELATE TO OIL DILUTION IN THE ENGINE, BUT DECIDED NOT TO ADDRESS IT.  NOW, I HAVE A CAR THAT IS NOT DRIVER ABLE AND NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. HONDA PLACE MY FAMILY LIFE IN DANGER, SUCH THAT THE STREET AROUND OUR CITY, CARS DRIVES BETWEEN 55 TO 70 MPH. THIS EASILY COULD CAUSE A CAR TO RE-END OR T-BONE THE CAR WHILE MAKING A TURN ON A BUSY TRAFFIC STREET.",

WHEN I CAME BACK HE TOLD ME HIM AND ALL OF HIS TECHNICIANS DROVE THE CAR AND NO ONE HAD A CLUE AS TO WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. OVER TIME IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE. IT HAPPENS AFTER DRIVING AT INTERSTATE SPEED FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. ONLY WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS POSITIONED 100% STRAIGHT. WHEN YOU PULL TO ONE SIDE, AND IT NEVER MATTERS LEFT OR RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S BOTH SIDES, IT'S LIKE ITS STUCK OR PULLING AGAINST YOU, LIKE A RESISTANCE. THEN IT SUDDENLY LET'S GO AND IT JERKS. AND THEN IT'S BACK THE OTHER WAY. SO YOU'RE FIGHTING THE STEERING WHEEL THE WHOLE TIME DRIVING WHILE YOU'RE JERKING BACK AND FORTH SIDE TO SIDE ALL OVER THE LANE. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST INTERSTATE. DUE TO BEING A SINGLE MOM AND NOT HAVING THE \"TIME OFF WORK\" AS WELL AS NO ONE BELIEVING ME, HERE I AM ABOUT 4 MONTHS LATER AND IT'S SO MUCH WORSE. IT'S ALSO SUMMER NOW WHICH I NOTICE IT'S ALSO AT ITS WORST WHEN ITS BLAZING TEMPERATURES. IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR A NOISE NOW WHEN IT DOES IT. I'VE LOOKED THIS UP BECAUSE I FELT LIKE PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE REPORTING THIS SAFETY ISSUE, I CAN'T FIGURE HOW THIS HASN'T BEEN A RECALL. I UNDERSTAND THINGS ON VEHICLES NEED TO BE REPLACED AFTER A WHILE. THEY NEED MAINTENANCE AND THEY COST MONEY. BUT FOR THIS WIDESPREAD ISSUE ON THE SAME CAR AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE?!

I WENT IN AGAIN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEM AND FOUND SECURITY CODES RELATING TO HOOD SWITCH IN THE SECURITY HISTORY. THEY SUGGESTED TO REPLACE THE HOOD LATCH/SWITCH ASSEMBLY AND RECHECK. ANOTHER PERSON I SPOKE WITH, THAT HAD THE SAME ISSUE, CLAIMED THAT REPLACING THE HOOD LATCH ASSEMBLY WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. I ASKED ABOUT MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY SINCE THIS ITEM ISN'T COVERED BY DEALERSHIP WARRANTY OF 3 YRS/36K MILES.

I WROTE HONDA REGARDING THIS. IN THE MEANTIME, I CANNOT USE MY SECURITY SYSTEM, THAT I PAID FOR ON THE VEHICLE, DUE TO IT POSSIBLY DRAINING MY NEW BATTERY. HONDA (REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER) STATED, OVER THE PHONE, THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST OF REPLACEMENT AND THAT IT FALLS UNDER THEIR WARRANTY OF PARTS.

WE HAD A WORKER AT AUTOZONE CHECK THE LIGHTS WITH ONE OF THEIR TOOLS AND WERE TOLD THE LIGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF  IN THE INITIAL INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO OUR PURCHASE. WE WENT BACK TWICE SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER AND SERVICE TEAM AND WERE TURNED AWAY WITH A LIST OF ALL OF THE LIGHTS ON IN THE VEHICLE WITH NO REMEDY TO FIX ANY OF THE ISSUES. WHEN WE BROUGHT UP THE RECALL AGAIN WE WERE TOLD OUR CAR DID NOT FALL UNDER IT. BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE I AND MY BOYFRIEND COULD AVE LOST OUR LIVES IN AN ACCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY.

THE THING THAT FRUSTRATES ME THE MOST IS THAT HONDA'S BRAND OF RODENT DETERRENT TAPE IS NOT PART OF ANY DEALER OPTION PACKAGE.

NOW I'M LOOKING AT OVER $1000 IN DAMAGE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY TAPE AND HONDA CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE WAY THEY REPAIR IT WILL NOT PREVENT IT FROM OCCURRING AGAIN. I'VE ONLY OWNED THE CALL FOR 3 MONTHS. I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AND THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER $1000 REPAIR.  DOES HONDA TRULY BELIEVE THAT USING THESE PARTS IS OKAY?

I BOUGHT ONE A WEEK BEFORE THIS \"STOP SALE\" AND I AM APPARENTLY GOING TO BE FORCED TO DRIVE A VEHICLE THAT MAY HAVE A POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING DEFECT UNTIL THEY FIX IT WHICH WILL NOT BE UNTIL THIS SUMMER ACCORDING TO HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WAS GIVEN A CLAIM NUMBER AND I HAVE REQUESTED A RENTAL FROM HONDA SO THAT I CAN STOP DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNTIL THEY MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE. \"ENGINE FAILURE\" ON ANY ROADS MUCH LESS A BUSY HIGHWAY IS DANGEROUS AND AN OBVIOUS MAJOR PROBLEM, AND I AM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MY TODDLER IF MY BRAND NEW HONDA CIVIC DIES ON ME OR CATCHES FIRE. WILL SOMEONE REAR END ME? WILL I BE STUCK IN TRAFFIC? WHO KNOWS.
