The mirrors automatically dim at night when the headlights are turned on, the side view mirrors especially dim to a very dark level where it is unsafe and I can not properly see making it unsafe to drive the vehicle.  I wish I am able to deactivate this feature as stated in my owners manual for the vehicle.",
