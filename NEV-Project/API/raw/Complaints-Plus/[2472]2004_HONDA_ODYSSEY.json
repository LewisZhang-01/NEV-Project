I AM CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THE ISSUES THAT THE RECALL WARNS THAT MAY HAPPEN DUE TO THE ONGOING GEAR ISSUES. LAST WEEK, WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, MY VAN'S TRANSMISSION LOCKED UP AND I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME SAFELY. I RELY ON MY VAN FOR WORK THEREFORE THIS MATTER IS AFFECTING US FINANCIALLY. MY WIFE RECENTLY CALLED THE MANUFACTURER'S RECALL HOTLINE AND SPOKE WITH LISA. THE REP ADVISED THAT I WILL HAVE TO TOW MY VAN AND PAY OUT OF POCKET, FOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO EVALUATE THIS ISSUE. SINCE THE MANUFACTURER FAILED TO REMEDY THIS RECALL LAST YEAR, I AM REQUESTING THE FOLLOWING: I WOULD LIKE FOR AN ENGINEER OR MECHANIC TO BE DISPATCHED TO OUR HOME AND CHECK THE TRANSMISSION. ONCE THE MATTER IS ASSESSED, THEN I CAN PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR MY VEHICLE TO BE TOWED TO A NEARBY AUTHORIZED HONDA DEALER FOR SERVICE. LISA EXPLAINED TO MY WIFE THAT THERE IS A 50/50 CHANCE THAT THIS TRANSMISSIONRECALL ISSUE WILL ACTUALLY BE REPAIRED WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE. I CURRENTLY LIVE IN FLORIDA WHICH IS THE THIRD STATE WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF COVID-19 CASES THEREFORE THIS WOULD BE THE MOST FEASIBLE OPTION. LAST YEAR'S CASE WITH THE MANUFACTURER WAS CLOSED PREMATURELY EVEN THOUGH MY WIFE ADVISED IT WAS STILL ONGOING.

THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS DRIVING ON A 2-LANE HIGHWAY. THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING IT ON HWY 80 TOWARDS RENO. THE 3RD TIME IT HAPPENED, SHE WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT THE SAME PLACE I WAS, ON 41 NORTH. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS ON A MEDIUM TO LONG TRIP GOING UP AN INCLINE.

IF YOU VISIT THIS WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE THE DEFINITE DIFFERENCE IN PROPORTION OF COMPLAINTS FOR THE EARLIER GENERATIONS VS THE LATER. IT APPEARS THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT CAUSES FLUID FLOW CONSTRICTION DURING TORQUE CONVERTER LOCK, WHICH RESULTS IN OVERHEATING.   IN THE LAST INCIDENT, AS DESCRIBED BY MY WIFE, SHE WAS DRIVING UP 41, AND THE ENGINE WENT UP TO AROUND 4000 RPM. THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND SHE SMELLED TRANSMISSION FLUID BURNING. SHE HAD TO WAIT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A WHILE, AND THEN IT STARTED TO WORK AGAIN. SHE GOT IT TO A SAFER PLACE AND THEN LET IT COOL FOR LONGER.

AFTER THE WORK WAS DONE THEY SHOWED ME THAT THE OIL DRAIN PLUG WOULD NOT TORQUE DOWN TO SPECS (JUST SPINS). THE OIL WAS LEAKING FROM THE OIL PAN. ANDERSON HONDA'S SERVICE ADVISOR DENIED THAT THEY OVER-TORQUED THE PLUG. THE MILEAGE WAS ONLY 67637, THE PLUG HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF AND PUT ON FOR ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES AND IT'S THE ORIGINAL HONDA PART IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. BEFORE THE OIL CHANGE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR AND DURING THE LAST TIME MAINTENANCE AT ANOTHER HONDA DEALER THE CAR WAS CHECKED WITH EVERYTHING OK. ON 8/29/2016 I TOOK MY CAR TO VICTORY HONDA AT SAN BRUNO TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE OIL PAN WAS REPLACED. THE OLD OIL PAN SHOWED THE SCREW IN THE OIL PAN WAS DAMAGED BY THE STEEL PLUG. THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM COULD BE:  1 ANDERSON HONDA'S TECHNICIAN OVER-TORQUED THE PLUG AND DAMAGED THE OIL PAN. BUT THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE HONDA OFFICIAL DEALER AND THEY DIDN'T OVER-TORQUED IT.  2. HONDA'S PARTS OR DESIGNS HAVE DEFECT. THEY SHOULD NOT PUT STEEL PLUG ONTO A SOFT METAL PAN DIRECTLY.    I THINK THE COST OF REPLACING DAMAGED OIL PAN SHOULD BE PAID EITHER BY ANDERSON HONDA OR HONDA OF AMERICA. THE CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR THEIR FAULT.

MY CAR HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT; HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO SEND THIS COMPLAINT TO YOU I HAD TO ENTER AN ACCIDENT DATE.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING SINCE MARCH 2014 TO GET THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE AIR BAGS IN MY 2004 HONDA ODYSSEY.  ACCORDING TO A HONDA OFFICIAL AT 1-800-999-1009 AND THE OFFICIAL HONDA WEBSITE, BOTH MY DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAGS ARE AFFECTED TO BY RECALL NOTICE.  HOWEVER, SINCE MARCH I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND CONTINUE TO GET A RUN AROUND.  THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE BAGS UNTIL THEY PROVE, IN DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, TO BE DEFECTIVE. I WILL BE CHARGED  $90 FOR EACH TEST THEY FIND NEGATIVE.  IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL AIRBAGS FROM THIS REGION OF THE COUNTRY AND BEARING MY VIN, MAKE AND MODEL WERE TO BE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE.  I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A PAPER RECALL NOTICE, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO A  HONDA OFFICIAL ON 9/15/14, THE DELAY IN MAILING THEM OUT IS DUE TO THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE REPLACEMENT AIRBAGS TO HANDLE THE RECALL NOTICE.  I HAVE LEFT SEVERAL VOICE MAIL MESSAGES WITH THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE, BUT NO ONE HAS RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS.  JUST WHAT AM I EXPECTED TO DO?  HOW LONG MUST I WAIT TO RECEIVE PROPER NOTICE FROM HONDA OFFICIALS?  AM I EXPECTED TO PAY FOR ALL OF THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS?  IF AN AIRBAG PASSES A   DIAGNOSTIC TEST THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL NOT DEPLOY AT A FUTURE TIME WITH THE SAME DISASTROUS OUTCOME WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IN THE NEWS.

SUDDENLY IT CAME BACK ON ALONG WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  TOOK VEHICLE BACK TO THE SERVICE STATION AND THEY NOW DIAGNOSED IT WITH THE P0740 CODE TCC LOCKUP SOLENOID.  CALLED SEVERAL TRANSMISSION SHOPS THAT TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS IS TO GET A NEW TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF $3500 AND UP.  THIS IS VERY DISCERNING THAT THE TRANSMISSION DIDN'T LAST LONGER AND THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL VEHICLE AND HONDA REFUSES TO ISSUE THE RECALL ON ALL 2004 TRANSMISSIONS.  THERE ARE SERVICE BULLETINS OUT THERE REFERRING TO THIS SPECIFIC  ISSUE.  I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AND THEY REFUSED TO ASSIST STATING THE VEHICLE IS WAY OUT OF WARRANTY TO ASSIST FINANCIALLY.   I HAVE HAD ALL THE SERVICE DONE AT THE DEALER UNTIL THERE WAS AN ISSUE LAST YEAR WITH THE HEATING/AIR CONDITIONER THAT THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY FIX AFTER 6 VISITS AND NUMEROUS COOLANT FLUSHES.  I HAVE NO FAITH IN THAT LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO HELP.  NOW I'M STUCK WITH A MONEY PIT AND CAN'T AFFORD TO REPLACE IT.  NEVER AGAIN HONDA. THEY HAVE CERTAINLY LOST MY LOYALTY AFTER ALL THIS.  WE DEALT WITH THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE 2003 ACURA TLS TRANSMISSIONS THAT WERE BAD, 3 TRANSMISSIONS LATER AND NO HELP FROM HONDA WHO KNOWINGLY COVERED UP THEIR FAULTY TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND LEFT CONSUMERS FOOTING THE BILL.  *TR",

TRANSMISSION REGULAR MAINTENANCE COMPLETED AND A FIRMWARE UPDATE WAS DONE IN 2009 AT 120,000 (65,000 ON NEW TRANNY) MILES.  TRANSMISSION NOW DOWNSHIFTS VERY HARD (HARD SHIFT) FROM 3-2 WHEN COASTING DOWNHILL OR IF THE BRAKE IS SLIGHTLY APPLIED WHEN COASTING DOWNHILL.

Q4 2012 TRANSMISSION NOW SHIFTS FROM 1-2 IN ABOUT 3 SECONDS, NOT SLIPPING, BUT TAKING A LONG TIME TO SHIFT AND PREVENTS ACCELERATION DURING THIS DELAY.  COULD PREVENT ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE WITH LONG DELAY.  HONDA TECHNICIAN STATES NORMAL OPERATION AND INCLUDED IN FIRMWARE TO REDUCE DAMAGE DUE TO RECALL.  NOTE THESE ISSUES ARE ON THE SUPPOSEDLY \"FIXED\" TRANSMISSION.  SERIES OF DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE RECALL REPAIR DID NOT SOLVE TRANSMISSION FAILURE PROBLEM, BUT WAS A BAND-AID IN COMBINATION WITH FIRWARE UPDATES TO \"BUFFER\" 2ND GEAR MANUFACTURING DEFECTS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE TRANSMISSION WILL SURVIVE TO 100K MILES, BUT HAS RECEIVED EXCELLENT CARE AND REPAIRS.  SAFETY ISSUE IS THE INABILITY TO ACCELERATE DURING 1-2 SHIFT DELAY AND UNEXPECTED ENGINE BRAKING DURING DOWNHILL COASTING WHICH COULD TRIGGER REAR-END ACCIDENTS (NOTE NO BRAKE LIGHTS WHEN IT OCCURS).

BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP WAS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, I CHOSE MY RECOMMENDED LOCAL AAMCO SHOP TO DO THE REPAIRS.  CALLED HONDA AND WAS TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO \"GOODWILL\" CLAIM BECAUSE (A) THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT DO THE REPAIR AND (B) THE TRANSMISSION IS ONLY WARRANTIED BY HONDA FOR 36/36,000 (NO WONDER!!).  HOWEVER, THE DEALERSHIP HAD TOLD ME THAT HONDA RARELY PROVIDES \"GOODWILL\" CLAIMS AND IF THEY DO, I'D BE LUCKY TO RECEIVE $400, SO CONSIDERING THE DEALERSHIP WAS OVER $2000 MORE FOR JUST THE TRANSMISSION WORK, I COULDN'T RISK HAVING THE DEALERSHIP DO THE REPAIR TO LATER FIND OUT THAT HONDA WOULD REJECT A \"GOODWILL\" CLAIM.  *TR",

THE VAN STARTED ROLLING, I WAS PUSHED BY IT AND INJURED MY KNEE AS I WAS TRYING TO GET IN AND STOP THE CAR. THE CAR HIT THE RAILS RESULTING IN MINOR DAMAGE. I TESTED THIS PROBLEM AND IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, YOU CAN REMOVE THE KEY WITHOUT ANY EFFORT WHILE THE CAR IS STILL IN DRIVE. WHY HONDA ODYSSEY IS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL ISSUED FOR HONDA ELEMENT AND FEW OTHER HONDA MODELS? HANDA ODYSSEY 2004 HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS DESCRIBED HERE: HTTP://AUTOS.AOL.COM/CARS-HONDA-ELEMENT-2004/RECALLS/  SUMMARY:  HONDA IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2003 HONDA ACCORD, CIVIC TWO AND FOUR DOOR, AND MODEL YEAR 2003-2004 HONDA ELEMENT VEHICLES. THE INTERLOCK LEVER OF THE IGNITION SWITCH MAY UNEXPECTEDLY DEFORM, WHICH CAN ALLOW THE INTERLOCK FUNCTION OF A VEHICLE WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TO BE DEFEATED.  CONSEQUENCES:  REMOVAL OF THE IGNITION KEY WHEN THE GEAR SELECTOR OF A VEHICLE WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HAS NOT BEEN SHIFTED TO THE PARK POSITION CAN ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO ROLL AWAY, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  REMEDY:  DEALERS WILL REMOVE THE ORIGINAL INTERLOCK PIN AND LEVER WITHIN THE IGNITION SWITCH, AND REPLACE THEM WITH NEW, DESIGNED COMPONENTS. THIS SERVICE WILL BE PERFORMED FREE OF CHARGE. THE SAFETY RECALL BEGAN ON OCTOBER 7, 2010. OWNERS MAY CONTACT HONDA AT 1-800-999-1009.    THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, I DRIVE KIDS AND MY DISABLED MOTHER IN MY VAN, SOMEONE CAN GET INJURED. I HAVE TWO MORE OLDER HONDA CRV CARS AND THEY DON\"T HAVE THIS PROBLEM, ONLY HONDA ODYSSEY HAS THIS ISSUE.  *TT",

I FOUGHT BACK AND AFTER TALKING TO THE MANAGER THEY SAID IT WILL COST $50.00. I PAID AND AFTER 3 DAYS AGAIN NO AC.

I ASK WHAT A WOMAN IS SUPPOSED TO DO IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN AND THEY HAD NO SUGGESTION. WHY CAN'T THE CONTROLS BE DESIGNED SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION AND RESTART THE ENGINE TO UNLOCK THE LOCKED CONDITION. I CAN SEE THIS CONDITION AS A DISASTER ON A JAMMED FREEWAY. PUTTING A REMEDY IN THE DRIVERS MANUAL IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THIS RATHER PERPLEXING SITUATION, ESPECIALLY FOR NON MECHANICAL DRIVERS WITH POOR PERCEPTION SKILLS AND IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. *JB",

IT WAS GETTING SO BAD THAT WE DECIDED TO PULL OFF AT A HONDA DEALERSHIP ALONG THE INTERSTATE.  THE SERVICEMAN JUMPED IN THE VEHICLE AND IT DID NOT ACT OUT OF THE ORDINARY.  HE TOLD US THAT LIKELY A COMPUTER CHIP WAS OFF AND NEEDED RESETTING, SO IF IT DID IT AGAIN, TO BE SURE TO PULL OFF THE INTERSTATE AND SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE.  WE PROCEEDED ANOTHER 60 MILES OR SO WITHOUT INCIDENT.  UPON OUR RETURN TRIP A WEEK LATER, THE VAN DID THE SAME THING.  IT WAS GETTING SO BAD THAT WE COULD ONLY GO 45 MILES PER HOUR IN THE PASSING LANE ON THE INTERSTATE.  (KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR VAN HAD LESS THAN 3,000 MILES ON IT WHEN WE LEFT FOR OUR TRIP.)  WE PULLED OFF A FEW TIMES TO TRY TO \"RESET\" THE VEHICLE, TO NO AVAIL.  FINALLY, WE KNEW WE WOULD NOT MAKE IT HOME.  AT THAT POINT, OUR ENGINE LIGHT AND TCS LIGHTS CAME ON AND STAYED ON.  WE PULLED OFF AT ANOTHER SERVICE CENTER, AT WHICH POINT OUR VAN TOTALLY DIED.  WE HAD TO HAVE A TOW, A TAXI, AND GET A HOTEL SINCE IT WAS SUNDAY.       IT TURNED OUT THAT THE FUEL PUMP FAILED AND SENT METAL THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.  THEY HAD TO FLUSH THE TANK, HOSES, ETC., REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP, AND REPLACE A COUPLE OF FUEL INJECTORS.   THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF SERVICE FOR ELEVEN DAYS.  WE ARE NOW FEARFUL THAT THERE IS ENGINE DAMAGE THAT WON'T SHOW UP UNTIL AFTER THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.
