While towing a 5,000 pound dual-axle travel trailer for the first time since I purchased the truck brand new from Toyota in 2017, I attempted to setup the IBC. Instructions say to set Type, which I set to electric brakes matching the trailer, then adjust the gain up while travelling around 25 miles per hours. When lock up of the trailer brakes occur, reduce the gain slightly to prevent full lock up.  At a Gain of 10 (10 is the maximum), I could not achieve brake lock up and could only obtain weak trailer braking.   The trailer was tested with a different tow vehicle and there were no problems obtaining lock up at mid-range gain.   I had Toyota inspect the software updates to the IBC on January 14, 2022 and Toyota advised the IBC is up to date on its software and functioning correctly.   The Tundra is out of factory warranty, but since I did not own a travel trailer during the warranty period, there was no way for me to test the IBC before going out of warranty.",

ONE OF THE FEATURES THIS VEHICLE HAS IS THE INTEGRATED BRAKE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR TOWING.  AS WE WERE HEADED HOME ON STATE HWY. 42 NEAR COOS BAY, OREGON, I NOTICED BLUE SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE PICKUP.  I WASN'T SURE WHAT HAPPENED.  I STOPPED AS SOON AS I COULD AND I COULDN'T LOCATE THE CAUSE OF THE SMOKE.  I LATER LEARNED THERE HAS BEEN MANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE FAULTINESS OF THIS INTEGRATED BRAKE SYSTEM CONTROLLER.  I WANT THIS ISSUE FIXED SO I CAN BE ASSURED OF A SAFE TRIP WHEN TOWING MY RV TRAILER WITHOUT THE FEAR OF HAVING NO TRAILER BRAKES WHEN I NEED THEM OR HAVING THEM LOCK UP FOR NO REASON.  THANK YOU",
