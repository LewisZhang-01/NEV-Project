        "summary": "My 2020 Silverado HD truck requires a replacement wiring harness and DEF tank and is basically inoperable. This is a known issue for GM and spans multiple model years.GM continued to produce throughout multiple model years knowing that owners may be stranded and unable to use these vehicles because of the defective parts. Hardships for owners would include loss of income and exposure to various dangerous conditions. The DEF tank has a heater system that can get exposed to the DEF fluid because of a poor design and poor manufacturing standards resulting in short circuit. GM will replace the wiring harness and combination tank/heater assembly under warranty. The parts are supposedly on NATIONAL BACK ORDER, yet GM continues to manufacture and ship new 2022 models with the required parts needed for repairs. GM will not provide alternate transportation. Supposedly in excess of ten thousand trucks are affected. Warm climate owners and warm temperatures may affect this issue positively. GM has no policy for a timely response to this issue. Trucks will become unsafe to operate when the electronic controls limit the truck speed to 5 mph or less. An operator may become stranded and exposed to dangerous highway conditions if stranded with this issue.",

When this was discovered, GM began installing new pads which have a high scorch friction material and feature a new lining shim on the backing plate.   GM failed to notify their customers of this problem. GM has done this deliberately since once the vehicle reaches over 7,500 miles, the pads are no longer under warranty.   I discovered my vehicle was effected from this due to increasingly hearing a high pitch screeching sound coming from the vehicle. After immediately noticing the issue, I scheduled a service appointment and conducted my own research of this issue. This is when I discovered the technical bulletin. Due to my vehicle having over 7,500 miles, I was advised the cost for replacement is my responsibility.   The cost for replacement including parts and labor from Chevrolet is approximately $750-$800.  This issue is a direct safety concern and a known problem which GM failed to notify their customers of.
