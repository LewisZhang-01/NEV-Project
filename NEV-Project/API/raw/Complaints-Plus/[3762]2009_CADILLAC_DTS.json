THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGN OF BRAKE FLUID LEAKING.     IN DRIVING FROM CHICAGO NORTH TO HIGHLAND PARK ILLINOIS ON THE EXPRESSWAY, I HAD TO MAKE A SUDDEN STOP WHEN THE TRAFFIC SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT IN FRONT MY VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP WITHOUT AN INCIDENT.  ON RESUMING DRIVING, THE BRAKE PEDAL NEEDED TO BE PUSHED TO THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR.  I GOT OVER TO THE RIGHT LANE AND DROVE CAUTIOUSLY TO MY HOME AND THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE SERVICE STATION WHERE I HAD THE BRAKES SERVICED.  I WAS INFORMED THE BRAKE FLUID LINES WERE CORRODED AND WERE LEAKING.  THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGNS OF LEAKING IN MY CARPORT CONCRETE FLOOR.     THE SERVICE MECHANIC TOLD ME ON REPLACING THE TWO LINES TO THE REAR BRAKES AND THAT ALL OF THE LINES WERE ORDINARY STEEL.  APPARENTLY THE SUDDEN STOP I MADE BURST THE CORRODED BRAKE FLUID LINES.  THE SERVICE MECHANIC REPLACED THE LINES TO THE REAR BRAKE WITH VINYL COATED LINES, PHOTO ATTACHED.

THE HEADREST IS TILTED FORWARD AND I COULD NOT SIT ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE SEAT AS THE HEADREST WOULD BE PUSHING ON MY HEAD.  I TRIED ADJUSTING THE SEAT'S POSITION TO NO AVAIL.  I HAD TO SIT WITH MY BACK NOT RESTING ON THE SEATBACK.  THE DEALER'S ANSWER TO FIXING THE PROBLEM WAS TO TURN THE HEADREST BACKWARDS BUT NOW IT IS NOT SECURED IN ITS HOLDER.  THE BACK SEATBELTS WERE SO POORLY DESIGNED THAT ONLY A SKINNY PERSON COULD FASTEN THEM.  WE DISCOVEDRED THAT MOST OF OUR FRIENDS FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO FASTEN THOSE SEATBELTS.  AFTER STRUGGLING TO FASTEN THE SEATBELTS SOME FRIENDS JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE THE SEATBELTS UNFASTENED.  THE DEALER'S ANSWER TO THIS WAS TO GIVE US BLACK SEATBELT EXTENDERS TO FASTEN TO THE TAN SEATBELTS.  ALL OUR PASSENGERS WANT TO KNOW WHY WE HAVE THE TWO COLORS OF SEATBELTS.  IT IS RATHER EMBARRASSING TO SAY IT IS A DESIGN FLAW OF THE CADILLAC!  THE CAR LOOKS DOWDY WITH THE TWO COLORED SEATBELTS!  A SALESMAN IN THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR INFERRED THAT THE BACK SEATBELTS COULD BE FIXED IF HE COULD WELD A LONGER MOUNTING BRACKET TO WHICH THE SEATBELTS ARE ATTACHED.  HOWEVER, THE CADILLAC COMPANY WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DEALERSHIP TO DO SO AS THE DESIGN OF THE SEATBELTS CANNOT BE CHANGED EVEN THOUGH IT HAS AN OBVIOUS FLAW.  WE TRIED THE BACK SEATBELTS IN A SHOWROOM CAR AND THE SAME PROBLEM WAS NOTICED.  EVEN THE SERVICEMAN HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FASTENING THE BACK SEATBELTS. *TR",
