LAST YEAR AROUND THE MONTH OF JUNE - A  ROLL-BACK CAUSED VEHICLE TO ROLL-BACK ON A CURB ON RIGHT SIDE AND REAR TIRE HIT CURB PRETTY HARD.  I CONFIRMED LATER THE BEARING HAD A NOISY SOUND AFTER THAT (THE VEHICLE ALWAYS HAD A SLIGHT MUCH LIGHTER NOISE WHILE DRIVING). WE HEARD A SLIGHT LOUDER RUBBING SOUND AFTER THAT ROLL BACK ON A CURB INCIDENT.  DEALERSHIP TOLD ME HYBRIDS HAS SLIGHT NOISE DUE TO BATTERY ELECTRIC SOUND.  MONTHS LATER AFTER THE ROLL-BACK BEARING DAMAGE, I ASKED ABOUT ISSUE WITH A MECHANIC SHOP, THEY TOLD ME ISSUE SOUNDED LIKE BAD BEARINGS, AND I WAS TOLD TO GET SHOCKS CHECKED TOO.  I WAS UNEMPLOYED - AND THEY TOLD ME MOST PEOPLE CAN DRIVE WITH BAD BEARINGS FOR A WHILE.  HERE IS MORE DETAIL ON THE ROLL BACK - IT HAPPENS, WHILE MOVING FOOT FROM BRAKES TO GAS PADDLE.  WHEN THE ROLL BACK HAPPENS - IT'S AFTER I RELEASE BRAKES ON A SLOP.  I HAD TO QUICKLY HIT GAS OR MOVE QUICK TO BREAKS AGAIN- DUE TO  SOMETIMES I IN STOPPED IN TRAFFIC ON A HILL, AND I CAN'T HOLD THE GAS DUE TO FORWARD MOTION IN STOPPED TRAFFIC, SO WHILE HOLD BRAKE WITH RIGHT - I MOVE MY LEFT FOOT TO BRAKES AND THEN RIGHT FOOT OVER GAS - WHEN ABLE - MOVE FORWARD (AND I RELEASE MY LEFT FOOT FROM BRAKES).  MY DAUGHTER DRIVE MORE THAN ME, AND TOLD ME NOT TO HIT BRAKES TO QUICKLY OR QUICK MULTI-TAP & RELEASE BRAKES BEFORE I STOP, SHE IS RIGHT THIS ISSUE HAPPENS LESS NOW THAT I SLOWLY MOVE FOOT FROM GAS TO BRAKES GOING UP HILL).   THAT WAS WHEN I LEARNED TO COORDINATE FOOTING ON A HILL. I FOUND IT'S SORT OF EXPENSIVE TO FIX TIRE BEARINGS AT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, AND MY VEHICLE WAS OVER 70,000 MILES AT THAT TIME LAST YEAR - FROM HONDA.

I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED WHAT I WAS SEEING AND THAT IT WAS NOT ON THE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE OF THE GLASS.  THEY POLISHED AND CLEANED THE WINDSHIELD. WITH THE NEXT RAIN IT WAS STILL THERE.  I RESEARCHED AUTO WINDSHIELDS AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A FILM LAMINATE BETWEEN TWO LAYERS OF GLASS THAT MAKE UP THE WINDSHIELD AND CALLED MY SALESPERSON.  I HAVE A PHOTO AND EXPLAINED THE MAKEUP OF THE GLASS. NOBODY AT HONDA SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF A WINDSHIELDS COMPOSITION.  I INSISTED ON A NEW WINDSHIELD AND WENT TO HAVE SERVICE ON MY CAR THINKING THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELD.  I SHOWED THE PHOTO AND ACTUAL PROBLEM PARKED IN THE SHADE TO THE SERVICE ADVISOR, ROCKY WHITEHALL ,AND HE SHOWED THE PROBLEM TO SHIN, THE SERVICE MANAGER (SEPTEMBER 7 @ 7AM)  THEY POLISHED AND CLEANED IT AGAIN AND I REFUSED TO LEAVE.  ROCKY SHOWED ME ANOTHER INSIGHT WITH THE SAME PROBLEM INFERRING THAT THIS IS NORMAL.  MY ESTIMATED CLEAR VISIBILITY IS 1/3 AT NIGHT WITH RAIN, HORRIFIC GLARE FROM ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS, STREETLIGHTS AND STOP LIGHTS.  HONDA OF HOLLYWOOD HAS NOT CONTACTED ME YET.  AUTONATION RESPONDED TO AN EMAIL.  I AM STILL DRIVING UNDER A VERY DANGEROUS CLOUD WHEN IT RAINS.  I KNOW THAT HONDA JUST WANTS ME TO DISAPPEAR THINKING THAT THE PROBLEM WILL DISAPPEAR.  I AM CONTACTING THE PRESS TO GET THEM INVOLVED AND A LAWYER..  PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS MATTER.  I GUESS HONDA THINKS THAT THE TOYOTA DISASTER WILL NOT APPLY TO THEM.  IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE I AM ALL FOR HYBRIDS.  I LOVE THE INSIGHT AND ITS GREAT GAS MILEAGE AND HOW IT DRIVES.  THIS IS VERY DISHEARTENING. *TR",
