WHEN I HAD EXTENDED VALVE PUT ON MY REAR DUAL TIRES I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THE INSIDE TIRES WERE \"SUN CHECKED\" DAMAGED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  ALL OF THE OUT SIDE TIRES ARE NEW - SO THE DEALER TOOK THE OUTSIDE REAR DUAL TIRES AND PLACED THEM ON THE INSIDE WHERE THEY COULD NOT BEEN SEEN.  THE DEALER IS JC'S RV IN LIVERMORE, CA.  I FEEL THAT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FRAUD, BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE PLACED MY LIFE IN DANGER WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A BLOWOUT FROM DAMAGED TIRES THAT I ASSUMED WERE NEW LIKE THE OTHER 4 TIRES.  I DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH THE DEALERSHIP SINCE I CANNOT TRUST THEM.  I AM IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE MANUFACTURER GULF STREAM TO GET THE TIRES REPLACED WITH NO CHARGE TO ME.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A LENGHTY PROCESS AND IN THE MEAN TIME I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE MOTORHOME FOR FEAR OF A BLOWOUT.  MY GULFSTREAM MEMBER NUMBER IS #53-3678.  MELISSA ELLINGSON.  *TR",
