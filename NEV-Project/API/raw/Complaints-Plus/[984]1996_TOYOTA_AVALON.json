WE DO NOT HAVE REPLACEMENT FLOOR MATS, AND THE PEDAL WAS NOT STUCK.  WE CALLED TOYOTA TO CHECK ON RECALL INFORMATION.  SAID THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON OUR VIN#, AND  TOLD IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, DUE TO THE MILEAGE, BUT THEY DOCUMENTED MY REPORT IN THEIR CORPORATE RECORDS, AND TO TAKE IT TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT EVALUATED AND REPAIRED, WHICH WOULD NO DOUBT BE AT OUR EXPENSE SINCE IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY.

ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT \"BARK\" THE TIRES, IT IS QUITE SEVERE. MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY GASKET(S) WERE THE LIKELY CAUSE AND THEY HAD MY CAR FROM 9-3-03 TO 9-5-03 REPLACING THEM. THEY SAID THAT A TSB HAD BEEN ISSUED DETAILING THE REPLACEMENT OF THESE GASKETS, BUT NO RECALL HAS YET BEEN ISSUED. TOYOTA ENGINEERS CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THE LOWER VALVE BODY GASKET IN 1997 (TC00197 APR 1997) BECAUSE OF THIS.    THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE DIRECT CLUTCH PORTION OF THE TRANSMISSION COULD BE DAMAGED DUE TO THE CROSS LEAK FROM THE GASKET. MY QUESTION IS- WHY DID TOYOTA NOT RECALL THESE CARS BECAUSE OF THIS? TWO VALVE BODY GASKETS ARE LESS THAN $30.00 (TOYOTA PRICES). I AM NOT SURE IF THE NEW GASKETS WILL INTERCHANGE DUE TO CONSTRUCTION OF THE VALVE BODY, BORE, ETC.    ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER REPLACED THESE GASKETS AND I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I DID ORIGINALLY. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS GREAT TO WORK WITH (THEY CHARGED ME NO LABOR BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM).    I AM NOW STUCK WITH A CAR THAT I HAVE PUT ROUGHLY 60,000 MILES ON SINCE PAYING OVER $20,000.00 FOR IT (BEFORE TRADE-IN) IN 1999.

I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RESOLVE WITH TOYOTA CORPORATE PERSONELL AS I BECAME AWARE OF THE 1997-2002 TOYOTA VEHICLES WITH THE SAME ENGINE THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING REPAIRED BY TOYOTA UNDER THE \"SPA CAMPAIGN\" THAT TOYOTA SAID THEY WORKED OUT WITH YOUR ORGANIZATION.  I HAVE BEEN OFFERED 50% REPAIR FROM TOYOTA CORPORATE DESPITE BEING ACCUSED OF NEGLECTING MY VEHICLE(I PROVIDED TOYOTA WITH ALL OF MY SCHEDULED MAINTENEANCE AND OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS AT  WELL WITHIN THEIR RECOMMENDED TIME/MILEAGE INTERVALS.  I AM AWARE OF MANY OTHER 1996 TOYOTA AVALON OWNERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HE SAME PROBLEMS/FALSE ACCUSATIONS AN GRIEF FROM TOYOTA.  SOME HAVE RECEIVED FULL PAYMENT FOR THEIR ENGINE REPAIRS.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OIL GELLING(SLUDGE) PROBLEMS MANY OF THEIR VEHICLES ARE HAVING.  I FEEL THAT MY 3 SMALL CHILDREN AND I ARE AT RISK OF SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO THE PROBLEM WITH TOYOTAS 6 CYL ENGINE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN GIVE ME AND WHY 1996 AVALONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE \"SPA\" PROGRAM WHEN IT IS THE SAME ENGINE AND SAME ENGINE PROBLEMS OCCURRING.  PLEASE HELP.  MONICA AT TOYOTA SAID IT WAS WITH YOUR ORGANIZATION, GUIDANCE AND APPROVAL THAT THE CURRENT \"SPA\" CAMPAIGN WAS IMPLEMENTED.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO STAND UP TALL AND SUPPORT THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD.  IT IS WAY TOO EASY TO BE A \"FAIR WEATHER FRIEND\" .  NOW WE ARE \"NEGLECTFUL OWNERS\"  HMMM.*AK",
