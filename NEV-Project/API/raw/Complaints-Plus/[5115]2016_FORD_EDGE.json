There is no lug wrench or socket that will fit the lug nuts with the caps on them. Here is the \u201crub\u201d I called the dealership and the service technician said \u201c to get a oversized socket and bang it on and then remove each lug nut , then replace all of them with new ones without the caps on them.\u201d WOW. Ford has to know that this is a issue everyone that owns one has the same issue. Now imagine getting a flat on the interstate with the family at 1:30am.Now you would have to have the vehicle towed and find a ride at 1:30am. Now that would be a 15 minute job if Ford would do a recall and replace all of these ignorant lug nuts. Wow what a waste of time and money. I don\u2019t know maybe Ford did not want the customers to remove the wheels never. Please help",

Personal safety is compromised because the engine can fail at any moment. Navigating safely through traffic with an engine fail and then being stranded on the freeway (at night in freezing cold temperatures) is a serious hazard.  The problem has been confirmed by a few mechanics. Also, Ford Motor Company issued a TSB 19-2208 detailing this problem for the vehicle. Mysteriously, this TSB has suddenly disappeared but I have a pdf of their advisory detailing the defect.   Ford Motor Company requested the vehicle be inspected by a certified dealership, who confirmed the problem. Ford is acknowledging the original engine manufacturer's defect. Mechanics report this is not a wear-and-tear issue.  An engine warning light was the first indication of the problem. The problem appeared just after the manufacturer's 100k mile/5yr warranty expired. The vehicle has 105k miles. The vehicle was 3 months past the warranty when Ford was first contacted and notified of the problem.  I have been in contact with Ford Motor Company for a couple of months trying to fix this problem. They are now refusing to discuss anything about the issue. Originally, they acknowledged the issue and their TSB proves they were aware of it even to the point of detailing the procedure for diagnostics and repair. Ford also previously reimbursed full expenses for the repair of their defective engine. Now it seems they are trying to cover it up trying to make it disappear, maybe so it does not get listed as a recall? The vehicle is a hazard to drive for my 80 year old mother who still works, but she has no other choice. I am seeing reports of this same engine fail online by other owners.",

I feel it is Fords responsibility to see that this problem is taken care of. I do not understand why there has not been a recall on this problem,Why? If your engine stops running out on the highway you could be in for a grave accident. I know there is a Class Action lawsuit pending and like many big lawsuits they can take years to be resolved and who makes the money? the lawyers and then there will not be enough money left to pay back all these people who had to put out thousands to replace these motors. If the consumer wins there will probably be made some deal which will help Ford and the lawyers and then there will not be money left to help the consumer.

The car has noticeably less traction and has hydroplaned twice during rain events while travelling on the Interstate roads during the pas 14 days.  The local Firestone dealer told me there was nothing they can do to pro-rate the mileage until the tires are worn down to 4/32 tread depth. The TIRES ARE UNSAFE NOW.

During this time, the vehicle's steering would also exhibit momentary losses of power assist accompanied by clicking noises coming from the steering wheel.  The dealer\u2019s diagnosis returned a faulty steering wheel with complete steering wheel replacement being the remedy.  This was quoted as as a $2,500 repair!!  Through manufacturer goodwill, I would be on the hook for 50% of that which is still ~$1,250 on a vehicle with only ~36K miles!  Further, I quickly discovered that this issue is well-known for my model to the point that Ford has issued service documents to address complaints (Customer Satisfaction Program 19B04 - Supplement #1 and TSB# 16-2066, 03 November 2016).  Customer Satisfaction Program 19B04 - Supplement #1 even states \u201cService Action:  Dealers are to replace the adaptive steering wheel assembly. This service must be performed on all affected vehicles at no charge to the vehicle owner.\u201d  I negotiated with Ford customer service to have them cover a larger part of this exorbitant repair cost but to no avail.  Should a customer not expect a vehicle\u2019s steering wheel assembly to be manufactured in a way as to last the life of the vehicle?  The symptoms of this failure, momentary losses of power assist, clicking noises, steering wheel off-centered, should be considered a safety defect for which the manufacturer should be held responsible.

The dealer said our  warranty would cover it and they were going to get the parts. There was not a recall on the issue but hearing conversations in the dealership convinced us that the  issue should be a recall. We were provided a rental car for 5 days. After we pushed the issue Ford agreed to provide a rental car 60 days because parts are not available.  Different stories were told about the part availability until I did research and found tools were available but dealers were not selling or sharing because they have the  same issues. There should be buffer on service part tools and the Ford dealers are attempting to contain the situation in house instead of escalating the problem.  Currently there are two unresolved issues  1. Recall for brake lines where we were told they had parts and to bring car in . Got to dealer and there were no parts. 2. Dealer inspected car after having for three weeks and by me pushing the issue. Upon inspection dealer realized problem is the master cylinder and brake booster.  Parts are not available and there is not a plan to get parts in. Car has been at dealer since June.  We have never received a call from Ford to discuss our case which they committed to do with in 24hours of claim. Additional calls to Ford occurred none of  which are returned. The lack of parts is concerning but the attempt to keep the issue quite is a larger issue. Ford knows the master cylinder and booster is an issue but will not go through the channels.

The following day Wednesday I took it to my mechanic and they said it's a cylinder 2 misfire and replaced my spark plugs then 4 days later Sunday my check engine light came back on I could go no faster then 40mph. Had to wait till July 6th to bring it to my Ford dealership Steven's Ford in milford ct  where they found I had coolant leaking into my engine which is a know Ford issue with there 2015- 2018 eco boost engines and the only repair they have is to replace the engine with a new one because a reman engine would have the same problem and the reason I could not drive my car above 40 mph is because it was only running on 3 cylinders",
