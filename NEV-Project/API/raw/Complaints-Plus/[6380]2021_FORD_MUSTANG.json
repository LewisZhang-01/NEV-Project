        "summary": "Purchased vehicle new It took me a long time to understand what the issue was.  I complained to Ford and they gave me account rep that has never driven manual transmission. When I contacted Ford the end result was they have found nothing and car is operating normally.  My issue : \"driver assist\" on clutch.  It auto revs the throttle and is extremely inconsistent. I can forward to 20 second videos it needed. Problem is with the clutch and brake pedal.  Releasing brake pedal causes engine to rev anywhere from 900-1500 rpm.  Problem is driving in slow traffic scanario  when you have have to two-foot clutch and brake.  Engine will want to take off. I have had almost two near rear end collisions. The rev is uncontrollably inconsistent.  One example: I was following a car running 2 miles per hour in an ally. Not following that close.  At normal idle the mustang is about 5 miles per hour so I was catching them. I pushed clutch and brake to slow down. Then released the pedals the car unexpectedly surged forward.   The problem wouldn't be so bad if it were consistent or would be disabled if the car is already moving.",
