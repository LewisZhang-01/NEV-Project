We took the RV back to the dealer we bought it from & they told us they didn't work on that & to find a Ford dealer that would work on it. After many phone calls I found a Ford dealer that would work on it. They told us nothing was wrong with the steering.  It was engineered badly. They said the back end was too heavy & was making the front end light & \"squirrely\" & difficult to steer.  They said it needed heavier suspension on the back end. They suggested heavier springs or installing suspension air bags.  The other problem was the dash board lights started flashing off & on. Most of the time the dashboard lights were off. We could only see the speedometer,  gas gauge & other gauges when the lights flashed on. But we didn't know if they were accurate when they were on. At one point we smelled wires burning & then the cruise control went out. The electrical problems started 07/19/2021.",
