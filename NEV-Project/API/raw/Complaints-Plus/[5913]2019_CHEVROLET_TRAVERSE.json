A few weeks after my 3 year warranty expired I started getting an \"Action Required Shift to Park\" message and the car would not recognize it was in park.  After numerous attempts it would eventually recognize and turn off properly. Not only is this frustrating but also dangerous. I called the dealer I purchased from and his only offer was to put it on the diagnostic machine told me that that would be deducted from the total.  When I asked what the ballpark figure would be, he said he did not know which tells me that they could just charge me whatever they wanted. He said he knew about this problem and the bulletin that was issued and had fixed many.   I'm assuming he should know a ballpark figure but the way he was doing it I wouldn't know until it was all said and done shameful way to do business for a known problem.  I called Chevrolet Customer Service and was told it was covered under the power train warranty.  Then I found a Chevy dealer in Smithville who acknowledged this is an ongoing problem, not covered by warranty and quoted me $500 to repair by replacing the sensor and harness. He got my business by being honest.  I have been a loyal Chevy customer for 50+ years and now rethinking what make car I will get in the future.   I am perplexed why Chevy doesn't issue a recall for this issue since a car needs to be in park and turned off.",

As I was driving toward the exit of the parking lot the windshield wipers went on, on their own and I was unable to turn them off. Then I lost control of my steering, several warnings and alerts went off on the dashboard and the car powered off in the middle of the road without any warning. Shortly after was able to turn the car on again and reverse and get it into a spot in the parking lot where again I lost steering, several alerts came on the dashboard and the car powered down again.  I had my two young children in the car and we could have been hit, if this occurred on a highway this could have been deadly! I was able to start the car again, drove it around the parking lot safely for a few minutes and then the incident occurred a third time in the exit lane of the parking lot. We called for a tow truck.  The car would not turn on again for several hours. When it did turn on it was moved to a safe location where it powered off spontaneously a 4th time.  When the car was picked up by the tow truck the following morning the car alarm was going off again and the doors were locking and unlocking spontaneously on their own.  Onstar sent a diagnostic report indicating an issue with the Engine and Transmission System.  The vehicle was towed to Millenium Chevrolet in Hempstead.  They were not able to check the car until Monday 9/13/21.  They replaced the battery, but were unable to identify the source of the problem.  After the battery was replaced, we were alerted that the horn was not working and the doors were locking and unlocking spontaneously.",

Due to this action required message the car will not properly shut off.The only way I am able to shut the car off is by restarting it and shifting into reverse or drive, back to park. Sometimes it takes up to six times of going through this process to get the car to shut off. This issue has been going on for over a month.  I arrived at the dealership for a scheduled oil change and the car did the same as I parked in their garage. I had a tech come out to see what was going on. He told me that Chevrolet was aware that this was happening in at least 4 models, including my Traverse. He immediately knew what the fix was. It was explained to me that there was a bulletin, but not a recall for this issue. The dealership said they could fix it for $140, and because I was 7,000 out of my bumper to bumper I had no choice but to pay the amount. If Chevrolet knows this is an issue then they should be covering the cost to repair it.  It is bulletin #19-NA-206. They installed a SL-N-Switch and an N-Harness. They also removed transmission range selector and removed and replaced wiring harness on the selector to a newer design, that\u2019s supposed to stop the issue.",
