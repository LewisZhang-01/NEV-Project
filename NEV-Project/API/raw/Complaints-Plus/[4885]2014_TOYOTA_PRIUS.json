I was fortunate that it was late in the evening with few cars on the road, had I been on the highway during rush hour the outcome, due to loss of power and control (steering), could have been catastrophic and perhaps fatal for me or other commuters. I note that in 2014, Toyota notified NHTSA of a recall to, \"rectify software in two of the Prius's electronic control units, one for the motor/generator and the other controlling the hybrid system.\" Further Toyota said, \"In rare circumstances, it could shut down the hybrid system itself, resulting in loss of power and the vehicle coming to a stop\".  This is exactly what happened to me the other night.  Toyota claims, in 2014, that \"it has received no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problem.\"  This seems to be an extraordinarily amount of good luck as I could have been easily rear-ended the other night. Curiously, in this NHTSA data base, another owner reported an incident (11439720) on November 8, 2021, that is similar to the experience I had just days prior.  And our VINS are eerily close.  Coincidence?  Not likely. Does the 2014 recall apply to my car and if not, why not given I experienced the exact same symptoms?",

Instead of braking, the car began to accelerate quickly. I pressed the brake pedal again - no response. Pressed down hard for a third time which executed an emergency stop. This all happened within 1 or 2 secs.   There were no injuries or involvement of other cars on this occasion. However, had I been any closer to the car in front, I believe I would have rear-ended it.   Had this occurred a few moments later, at the busy junction 400m ahead, it could have been fatal.   I am absolutely sure it was not driver error. I was not distracted, drive regularly, and have been a confident and safe driver for over 30yrs. I have never experienced this in a car before, and in fact wasn't aware that it could happen until I researched it on this site.   No warning lights or indicators came on. The car ran normally for the remaining 2 miles back home.    I didn't think anything of it before, but prior to this incident (in our 5 yrs ownership) there were approx. 5 instances when the engine would \"roar\" as if it wanted to accelerate but didn't when I was breaking or slowing down on a highway.   Also, there were perhaps 3 instances when the car felt as though it was \"running away\" i.e. a slight acceleration - for no obvious reason. As neither of these represented safety issues, I assumed the car was just a bit old and these issues would be addressed as part of any service. Now I wonder if they are related to the sudden acceleration.   The car is currently having a \"health checks\" run, but nothing has been found. I am reluctant to drive this vehicle if neither my dealer or Toyota can discern the problem.   Overall we have been happy with this car and its performance, but this is an unacceptable \"anomaly\" as far as safety is concerned.   Vehicle available for inspection.",

SHE WAS ALONE IN THE VEHICLE, WEARING HER SEAT BELT, TRAVELING AT 20 MPH IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE, WANTING TO TURN SOUTHBOUND ON SOSSAMAN RD., SOME 200 YARDS FURTHER EAST.  CONSTRUCTION CREWS HAD REMOVED A PORTION OF THE ROADWAY, CREATING A DITCH, ABOUT 8 FEET LONG IN THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, ABOUT 10 TO 12 INCHES DEEP AND ABOUT TWO LANES WIDE.  AFTER PASSING A CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE, SHE BEGAN HER TURN TO THE RIGHT AND RAN INTO THE DITCH.  THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE PRIUS DROPPED INTO THE DITCH AND PROCEEDED ACROSS THE OPENING SOME 8 FEET, AT A SLIGHT ANGLE, AND IMPACTED THE CONCRETE ROADWAY ON THE OTHER SIDE, CAUSING A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT DECELERATION.  DUE TO THE RELATIVELY SHALLOW DITCH, AND THE LOW GROUND CLEARANCE OF THE PRIUS, THE CAR RODE UP ON THE CONCRETE AND THE BRUNT OF THE IMPACT WAS ABSORBED BY THE UNDERCARRIAGE.  THERE WAS SOME FASCIA AND BUMPER DAMAGE.  THE WHEELS DID NOT IMPACT THE CONCRETE BARRIER.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.

THE MECHANIC SAID I GUESS THAT IS WHY THEY PUT THE 2 NEW TIRES IN THE FRONT TO CORRRECT THE PROBLEM BUT WHAT YOU NEED AFTER MY TEST DRIVE IS A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT. SO I SAID GO AHEAD AND DO IT. DURING THE PROCESS THE ALIGNMENT MECHANIC GUY SAID THE FRONT PASSED BUT THE REAR FAILED. SO THEY CALLED TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND ASKED IF THEY WERE SPECIAL SHIMS TO FIX THE REAR ALIGNMENT.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SAID THERE ARE NO PARTS FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT CAR MODEL DOES NOT REQUIRE A REAR ALIGNMENT. THE C IN TOYOTA PRIUS MEANS C IS FOR CITY DRIVING ONLY. WE WERE STUNNED. I SAID I KNEW THEY HAD A REASON WHY THEY GOT RID OF THE CAR BUT CAN YOU FIX IT ? THE MECHANIC SAID IT IS A POSSIBLE FACTORY DEFECT AND WE SEE SOME OF THOSE SOMETIMES BUT I THINK WE CAN FIX IT AND SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS WITH THAT CAR. WE CAN USE SOME SHIMS THAT ARE MADE FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TOYOTA CAR AND SEE IF WE CAN GET IT IN PROPER ALIGNMENT. I SAID I AM WILLING TO GAMBLE ON YOUR EXPERTISE GO AHEAD AND DO IT. IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY WITH CARVANA BUT I DO LIKE THE HATCHBACK CAR. AFTER THE WORK WAS DONE THE TEST DRIVE PROVED THE SUCCESS AND THE PROBLEM WAS GONE.

BEFORE I COULD PUT IT IN DRIVE FROM REVERSE IT STARTED ROLLING DOWNWARD ON ITS OWN.  WHEN I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES, THEY WERE SQUISHY AND DID NOT ENGAGE.  I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THEM TO ENGAGE BUT THEY NEVER DID.  I WENT TO PUT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON BUT IT IS LOCATED SO HIGH UP IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET MY FOOT UP THERE QUICKLY.  MEANWHILE THERE WAS A TRUCK PARKED ACROSS THE END OF THE PARKING LOT LANE SO MY CAR ROLLED INTO THE TRUCK CREATING DENTS IN THE FRONT DOOR PANEL AND REAR DOOR PANEL.  THIS WAS OBVIOUS BRAKE FAILURE.  I WENT TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA REPAIR AND DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH A SHOP EMPLOYEE.  HE TOLD ME THAT THIS CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN WHERE YOU CAN BACK A CAR UP AND TURN IT AND IT WILL GO ON ITS OWN (BUT IT SEEMS HE IMPLIED THAT THE \"READY\" LIGHT MIGHT NOT HAVE ENGAGED) AND THAT HE \"HAD SEEN IT HAPPEN HIMSELF\".  IF THE TRUCK HAD NOT BEEN THERE, MY CAR WOULD HAVE ROLLED DIRECTLY OUT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE THROUGH TOWN WHICH HAD THE HUGE POTENTIAL OF CAUSING A MAJOR ACCIDENT WITH INJURIES. I DID TRY TO RECREATE THE EVENT IN A NONPOPULATED AREA IN A VERY SAFE MANNER AND WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.  THAT EVEN SCARES ME MORE!!! AS YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF IT CAN OR WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  I SPENT $20,000 PLUS FOR A NEW CAR THAT I AM ALWAYS HYPER-CAUTIOUS IN BECAUSE NO ONE WILL FESS UP TO PROBLEMS. IF I SELL THE CAR IT WILL BE AT A GREAT LOSS WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD!  IN THE INTERNET I NOTE THAT THERE WERE SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES, ESPECIALLY AROUND 2007 - MANY WERE DOCUMENTED BUT TOYOTA WAS NEVER TAKEN TO TASK RE: THESE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AS I SUPPOSE THE CONSUMERS JUST COULDN'T \"PROVE\" THEM.

I CALLED TOYOTA AND I WAS INFORMED THE RECALL SERVICE HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED.  I CALLED A LOCAL DEALER (DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE) AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT WHEN THEY PULLED THE VIN, IT SHOWED STOP SALE IN EFFECT.   I DO NOT BLAME TOYOTA AS OBVIOUSLY IF ONE DEALER COULD SEE THE STOP SALE SO COULD THE OTHER.  I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE STRICTER REGULATIONS ON DEALERSHIPS TO MAKE SURE THESE RECALLS ARE COMPLETED BEFORE THE SALE!!  JUST LIKE THE GENTLEMAN THAT COMPLAINED EARLIER I ALSO PURCHASED A BRAND NEW DEFECTIVE VEHICLE,  HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE RECALL. !!  NOW I HAVE TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO TAKE IT IN TO HAVE THE RECALL FIXED.  THIS IS A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE, LOSS OF USE OF VEHICLE AND LOSS OF TIME FROM WORK.  I ALSO WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET COMPENSATED FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND TIME, PLUS THE FACT THEY SOLD AND I  HAVE BEEN DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE.  *TR",
