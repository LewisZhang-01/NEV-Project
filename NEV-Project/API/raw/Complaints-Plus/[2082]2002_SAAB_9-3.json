THE SEAT CUSHION IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE SEAT BACK AND FORCES THE DRIVER TO SIT ALMOST ACROSS THE SEAT TO BE ABLE TO FACE STRAIGHT FORWARD. ALSO THE LUMBAR SUPPORT IS UNEVEN AND ONLY SUPORTS THE LEFT SIDE. THIS FURTHER ADDS TO THE \"TWIST\" THAT THE DRIVER HAS TO ENDURE IN ORDER TO SAFELY OPERATE THE VEHICLE. THE COMPANY TECH REP TOLD ME THE SOLUTION IS TO NOT USE THE LUMBAR FUNCTION. ALSO THE SEAT BOTTOM SEEMS TO COLLAPSE ON THE LEFT SIDE WHEN TURNING OR CORNERING TO THE RIGHT. THIS HAS CAUSED ME TO ALMOST LOSE CONTROL MANY TIMES ON THE HIGHWAY AND ON OFF-RAMPS AND WHEN TAKING EVASIVE ACTIONS. I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ADD MY OWN PADDING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SEAT CUSHION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR SOMEWHAT NORMALLY. I AM NOW CONCERNED THAT THE SIDE AIR BAG WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF I AM IN A COLLISION. THE COMPANY AND THE DEALER SEEM UMWILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS IS CREATING BACK AND HIP PROBLEMS FOR ME. I BELIEVE THIS IS AN UNSAFE SITUATION THAT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT OR IN THE LEAST, CONTRIBUTE TO ADDITIONAL INJURIES IF I AM IN AND ACCIDENT. I CHOSE THIS CAR FOR IT'S SAFETY RECORD WHICH SEEMS SOMEWHAT IRONIC.*AK",
