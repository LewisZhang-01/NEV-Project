THE HEAT GETS SO HOT THAT IT HAS BURNED THE INSIDE IF MY THIGH. IF I SIT IN TRAFFIC FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME IT IS HARD FOR ME TO STAY ON MY BIKE DUE TO THE EXTREME HEAT UNDER MY RIGHT LEG. I HAVE CHANGED MY EXHAUST LIKE HARLEY RECOMMENDED, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP. I LOVE MY BIKE, BUT GETTING BURNS ON THE INSIDE OF MY THIGH SHOULD NOT BE A PART OF RIDING IT!",
