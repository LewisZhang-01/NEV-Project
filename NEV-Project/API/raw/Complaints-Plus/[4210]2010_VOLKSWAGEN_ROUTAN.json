Car appears to not be starting due to fuel relay with TIPM.  The intermittent headlights is very dangerous but corrects itself in a few days so mechanics haven\u2019t been able to figure it out. This car is related to the several Chrysler models from 2010-2014  (it states Chrysler on various parts of my VW Routan) that had a recall for issues with the TIPM box, which appears to be the issue with my vehicle. As far as I can tell the same recall was not issued for the Routan. Why? I\u2019ve found many similar descriptions of Routan owners that have had the same issues I have and these go back to the TIPM.

From November 2018 through early 2020, I experienced the car turning off while driving it about once every 4-6 months. When researching this issue we found that extra weight from other keys or keychains could be affecting it so we separated the car key from my house keys. This showed no improvement. From early 2020 through early 2021, the issue increased in frequency. Instead of once every 4-6 months it became once a month. And, unfortunately in the past 3 months, it has started occurring several times a week (sometimes multiple times a day). This has been a safety concern for our family and we are very nervous that this could cause a serious accident. Luckily the other vehicles around us when this occurs have been alert drivers that were able to give us the extra time to restart our vehicle. We realize that this won\u2019t always be the case and need to get it fixed.   The issues we are experiencing as outlined above are in line with the issues listed in NHTSA Campaign ID: 11V151000 for other 2010 VW Routans. However, for whatever reason, our VIN number is not included in the recall. I would like to make a formal appeal with nhtsa that our vehicle be included in this recall and that it be repaired by VW as it is quite clear that what we are experiencing is from the issue in this NHTSA Recall Campaign. We are disappointed to be in a position to fight for something to get fixed that is quite clearly caused by a defaulted part, but remain hopeful that this will be resolved in a timely manner.

They will either not turn at all, will turn on and start flashing, or will appear to be working as normal until I'm driving and then they will flash off intermittently. This puts anyone in my car as well as oncoming traffic at risk when my lights malfunction at night. The airbag warning indicator light also flashes off and on as well making me think that it may be failing whenever the TIPM is not functioning properly. The door locks and windows have also locked/unlocked and opened/closed at random (even when the vehicle is off and has been parked with the power off for hours). I spoke with the mechanic about all of these issues and he verified that it was likely a failing TIPM and that it is a well-known issue with the Routan.

THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE BEGAN APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN THE ENGINE QUIT NUMEROUS TIMES, MOSTLY WHEN STATIONARY, RIGHT AFTER STARTING, BUT TWICE WHEN IN MOTION IN FREEWAY TRAFFIC.  IN ALL CASES, THE KEY WAS UNTOUCHED AND REMAINED IN THE ON POSITION AND THE DASH LIGHTS REMAINED ON.  LIKEWISE, IN ALL CASES, AFTER JIGGLING THE KEY, THE VEHICLE RESTARTED AND RAN NORMALLY.  ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, A NEW PROBLEM SURFACED WHEREBY THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START UNTIL WE WIGGLED THE KEY FOR BETWEEN TWO AND TWENTY MINUTES.  MOST RECENTLY, AT THE END OF A TRIP, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT SHUT OFF.  THE ENGINE CONTINUES TO RUN, EVEN WITH THE KEY REMOVED. THIS PROBLEM PROMPTED US TO DELIVER THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL VW DEALER ON 12/26/2018 AND THEIR DIAGNOSTIC NOTES INCLUDE 'FOUND INTERNAL SEPARATION OF WIN MODULE.'  THEIR ESTIMATE IS FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE RECALLED ITEM, THE WIN MODULE.  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE, AND THE PART NEEDED, BOTH MIRROR EXACTLY THAT WHICH IS DETAILED IN THE PART 573 NOTICE AND AS SUCH, SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE COVERED REPAIRS.  MOREOVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT ACCURATELY ASSESS THE EXTENT OF THE DEFECTIVE VEHICLE RANGE.

WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH ONLY THE KEY IN THE IGNITION IT PERFORMS BETTER, ALTHOUGH STILL DIES OCCASIONALLY, BUT WITH ANYTHING ON THE KEYRING IT WILL DIE ALMOST INSTANTLY.  IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER REMOVING OUR CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT A RECALL ON THE VW ROUTANS THAT SEEMED VERY SIMILAR TO THE ISSUES WE WERE EXPERIENCING.

I HEARD A VERY RAPID \"CLICKING\" NOISE UNDER THE HOOD SO I OPENED IT AND DISCOVERED THE FUSE BOX UNDER THE HOOD WAS THE SOURCE.  UPON OPENING IT, I HEARD A VERY FAST CLICKING SOUND AND FELT EACH FUSE AND FOUND THE LARGE FUSE, 2ND FROM THE LEFT FRONT WAS CLICKING VERY FAST AND LOUDLY.  I NEEDED THE VEHICLE SO I USED JUMPER CABLES AND THIS EVENTUALLY ENABLED MY CAR'S KEY TO RELEASE.  ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE LIT UP AND I LEFT THE ENGINE RUN FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 MIN., THEN TURNED OFF THE CAR - TO VERIFY IT WOULD START AGAIN.  IT DID, AND NOW ONLY THE ENGINE WARNING LIGHT THAT LIGHTS UPON AN INCIDENT IS STILL LIT.

IT DID NOT TURN OFF.  I PRESSED THE BUTTON SEVERAL MORE TIMES, BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT.  I PRESSED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, BUT THE VEHICLE STAYED IN THE LOWER GEAR WITH THE ENGINE REVVING AND IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE BRAKE AND THE ENGINE WERE WORKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

TODAY IS THE LAST STRAW AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY KIDS. I BARELY SURVIVE THE INCIDENT. I HAVE NOT PICKED UP THE CAR FROM SERVICE SINCE AND I AM TRYING TO GET VW TO PUT IN ON ANOTHER VEHICLE. I HAVE READ THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THESE REPAIRS DONE AND THEY STILL ARE SHUTTING OFF AND SQUASHING THEIR KIDS.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO VW SINCE I TURN IN MY CAR FOR SERVICE AND TOLD THEM I DON'T WANT THE VEHICLE ANY MORE. VW KEEPS GIVING THE RUNAROUND AND HAVE BEEN STRINGING ME ALONG TELLING ME THAT THEY WILL HELP ME BUT TO WAIT FOR THEIR CALL TOMORROW. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 2 WEEKS SINCE I TOOK THE VAN IN TO SERVICE. EVERY DAY I CALL BACK AS THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR PROMISE OF A CALL BACK. I HOWEVER GET THE SAME INDIVIDUALS AND THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE CAR GETS FIXED. WELL WHAT IF THEY CAR DOES NOT GET FIXED OR TAKES MONTHS, AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT? I STRUGGLE SO MUCH TO GET A CAR RENTAL FROM THEM AND WHEN I DID, THEY GOT ME A COMPACT VEHICLE. I CAN'T TRANSPORT MY FAMILY IN THAT! AFTER COMPLAINING SO MUCH THEY FINALLY APPROVED A LARGER VEHICLE RENTAL. I HAVE RECEIVED THE CALL FROM SERVICE SAYING THE VEHICLE IS READY FOR PICKUP AND IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED. I CALLED VW AGAIN NOW THAT THE CAR SERVICE IS COMPLETED AND NOW THE VW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE. WHY STRING ME ALONG IF YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE ONLY OPTION THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE ME. THEY SAID TO GIVE THEM ONE MORE DAY AND TO EXPECT A CALL BACK AGAIN. I ASKED THEM WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE OR THE PLAN BUT THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND TO JUST WAIT FOR A CALL. I GUESS AT THIS TIME I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL VW OWNER FOR 8YRS BUT IF VW DOES NOT PUT ME IN A GERMAN VEHICLE I CAN EXPECT LEGAL ACTION IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE.  *TR",

        "summary": "THIS COMPLAINT IS REGARDING MY NEW 2010 VOLKSWAGEN ROUTAN, THE CAR IS UNDER TWO MONTHS OLD.     THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AFTER I PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND LEFT THE KEYS IN THE ENGINE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO RUN INTO OPEN THE GARAGE.... I WANTED TO GET A PUPPY OUT OF THE REAR OF THE CAR FIRST SO I WENT AND STOOD BEHIND THE CAR BUT IT WAS LOCKED (CLEARLY IN PARKED.) I THEN WENT TO THE DRIVERS SIDE TO HIT THE UNLOCK SWITCH ON THE DOOR AND THE CAR STARTED REVERSING AND I WAS JUST CAUGHT REALLY OFF GUARD SO I TRIED TO JUMP IN THE CAR AS IT WAS BACKING UP BUT I GUESS MY REACTION WAS TOO LATE AND I ENDED UP BEING SHOVED ON THE PAVEMENT AS THE CAR ROLLED OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY. AT THIS POINT I WAS CAUGHT UNDER THE OPEN DRIVERS DOOR AND I WAS DRAGGED ACROSS MY STREET.... I MANAGED TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE DOOR. THANKFULLY OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAS DEEP GUTTERS, I WAS ABLE TO CATCH UP TO THE CAR AND I MANAGE TO JUMP IN BECAUSE OF THE STALL THE GUTTER CREATED. THE CAR NEARLY RAN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE AND JUST MISSED THEIR MAILBOX.     I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE CAR COULD GO FROM A CLEARLY \"PARKED\" POSITION TO \"REVERSE\" ON IT'S OWN.    I HAVE ROAD RASH ON MY TOES, FEET, KNEES (MY JEANS ARE WRECKED), ON MY HIPS AND ON MY SHOULDERS. I HAVE BRUISES FROM THE DOOR BEING CAUGHT ON MY LEG, MY ENTIRE LEG IS SWOLLEN.     AFTER THE INCIDENT I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT AND FILED A REPORT.  *TR",
