Many functions will just randomly turn on or not work at all.  Dealer has been contacted and is aware of this issue.  The component has not been inspected but a visual inspection and you can see the delamination from the screen. There are no warning messages from the vehicle but the many functions that are associated with the touch screen will just happen without touching because the screen is pulling apart. Great for the radio to turn up to full volume while driving or the a/c or heat to just turn on. How about that backup camera that sometimes will not work now.  I've checked the web and noticed this is a problem with model year 2018 and possibly other years. Not a one time incident and seems to be happening to all models with the infotainment system.

A few short weeks later and now my backup camera isn't working at all, my screen randomly freezes up while driving or won't shut off when the car is turned off.  My heated steering wheel gets blazing hot and won't turn off and the heat and AC randomly turn themselves on at full blast.  I bought this particular vehicle Limited Edition because it had GPS, the backup camera and heated seats and steering wheel because I have severe arthritis and autoimmune issues that affect my joints and my vision.  The heat helps my back and hands so I can drive.  The camera was a great help in my being safe to back up as my peripheral vision is an issue.  This defective part is a SAFETY issue!  I don't feel safe driving the car because I cannot see to back up.

I had an oil change a month ago and I\u2019ve already lost a little over half of the oil, and there\u2019s no obvious oil leaks under the car. My tranny also won\u2019t shift past a 45 minute drive. It shifts rough for the first half hour but after that it progressively gets worse by the minute. After 45 minutes it won\u2019t go faster than 50ish mph and it makes a very loud humming sound when it tries to shift. It has a harder time driving through cities than on the highway, my car just won\u2019t go. I\u2019m trying to gather the money to get it fixed but times have been hard so I haven\u2019t even been able to drive the car. It only has 39k miles on it and I spent over 30k for it so it\u2019s super agitating.

It read a message of \u201cservice electronic parking brake\u201d and \u201cservice ESC system.\u201d My husband managed to get it to turn on the next day and we took it into the dealership, but they could not replicate the incident and said no codes appeared and the vehicle was \u201cfine\u201d. Less than a week later, the same issue arose yet again and I worked around some technical way to be able to turn it on. It was an off and on issue. A couple of days ago when turning on the vehicle to go to work the issue continued, but still I turned it on the way I have gotten accustomed to. As I shift gears into drive, I notice the car feeling somewhat shaky and when I head out lightly press my brakes, the brakes feel as if my emergency brake is engaged. I stop into a parking spot and turn on my emergency parking brake and then disengage it. Then I decide to see if that made a difference, well this time as I picked up speed (around 10mph) it felt as if I had a flat tire but all the tires were fine. I parked back up and took my car to the dealership the following day. On the short drive to the dealership the car felt like it was dragging heavily and the sound was a horrifying screeching sound. Once I arrived I explained everything and my car actually displayed the issue upon my arrival and was told it was odd, but yet again I have been told that they couldn\u2019t replicate the issue. I just can\u2019t understand how after seeing and hearing my vehicle there is nothing more that they can do to make sure there are no issues. Currently there are no recalls on my vehicle but I believe there should be further investigation into it as I am seeing many issues with the make, model and year I posses.",

Both times were during left-hand turns into traffic and I was lucky to have had enough speed to get out of the way. When I took my vehicle to the dealership, they gave me an oil change and told me to come back for an oil consumption test. Two months later (when I hit the designated miles for the test) they told me they'd found nothing wrong with the vehicle and sent me away. Two months later (and only 1300 miles since the oil change the dealership gave me), I was back at the same dealership with the same issue, low and dark oil. Luckily, I had been proactive and caught it before stalling in traffic anywhere. Again, the dealership offered to change my oil and do a consumption test, but nothing further. It's clear that the 2018 Jeep Compass has engine issues that Jeep is unwilling to acknowledge but these issues are dangerous and costly. I should not need an oil change every 1500 miles or risk putting myself and my passengers in danger.",

THIS HAS ALSO HAPPENED TO ME IN DRIVE THRUS WHILE STOPPING TO PAY AND AT STOP SIGNS, ALL DOING THE SAME THING AFTER BRAKING AND THE AUTOMATIC START/STOP ENGAGING. THE OTHER ISSUE I HAVE HAD HAS OCCURED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD/HIGHWAY. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME THREE TIMES NOW. IN ONE INSTANCE I WAS GOING 30 MPH AND MY CAR JUST STOPPED ACCELERATING AND THE POWER STIRRING NO LONGER WOULD WORK, THE SCREEN DISPLAYED A MESSAGE SAYING TO PUT MY VEHICLE IN PARK AND THAT MY VEHICLE NEEDED TO BE STARTED BEFORE IT COULD BE SHIFTED AND THE D SHOWN ON MY DASH WAS BLINKING. WHEN THE CAR STARTED TO SLOW I TRIED TO PULL OVER, BUT MY POWER STIRRING WOULDN'T WORK AND I WAS FROCED TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. ANOTHER TIME I WAS TRUNING A CORNER AT A RED LIGHT AND IN THE PROCESS OF THE TURN GOING AROUND 15 MPH MY CAR DASH SHOWED THE SAME MESSAGE AND PERFORMED THE SAME WAY WITH NO POWER STIRRING. THE THIRD TIME I WAS GOING 55 MPH DOWN A HIGHWAY AND THE CAR DID THE SAME THING. IN EACH OF THESE INSTANCES I PUT MY CAR IN PARK, PRESSED THE BREAK AND THE START BUTTON AND THE CAR DID NOT START, ON THE SECOND TIME IT DID NOT START AS WELL AND SOUNDED AS IF MY CAR WAS NOT GOING TO START AT ALL AND STALLED LIKE THE BATTERY WAS DEAD, WHICH IT CLEARLY WAS NOT. EVENTUALLY THE CAR STARTS AND I COULD THEN SHIFT TO DRIVE AND PROCEED AS NORMAL. THIS IS NOT OKAY THOUGH, AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. MY CAR IS NOT VERY OLD AND DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF MILES ON IT AT THE TIMES THESE OCCURED I WAS AT 31,000- 36,000 MILES.",

SINCE I DONT WANT TO KEEP GOING, I PULL OVER AS SOON AS I CAN AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF.  AFTER A SECOND, I RESTART AND EVERYTHING RUNS FINE.   AGAIN, BECAUSE ITS NOT THROWING ANY CODES, THE DEALERSHIP/SERVICE CAN FIND ANYTHING WRONG.   IT DOESNT MATTER IF ITS FULL TANK OF GAS OR ALMOST EMPTY.   NOTE:  IF IT STALLS AS IM DRIVING THERE IS A HUGE POTENTIAL FOR AN ACCIDENT.   I NEVER THOUGHT THAT BUYING A NEW CAR, I WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.",

IT TOOK BETWEEN 5-7 MINUTES TO FINALLY START RUNNING, BUT GAVE NO INDICATION OF WHAT THE ISSUE WAS, NO WARNING LIGHTS OR ANYTHING. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE A MILE TO MY DESTINATION WITHOUT ANY ISSUE, BUT WAS MOMENTARILY IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE AS THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN WITH NO NOTICE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I IMMEDIATELY MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.THE MAN WHO HELPED WE WHEN I GOT THERE SAID HE THOUGHT HE KNEW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. HE SHOWED ME THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ANY OIL ON THE DIPSTICK. I REALIZE I WAS ABOUT 800 MILES PAST THE 5000 MILE OIL CHANGE, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT JEEP SAID IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO BURN A QUART OF OIL EVERY 2000 MILES. THIS SEEMS EXCESSIVE TO ME AND EVERY MECHANIC THAT I'VE TALKED TO. I HAVE  READ THAT THE ENGINE WAS DESIGNED TO SHUT OFF WHEN OIL IS LOW AND CHRYSLER CONFIRMED THAT. HOW DOES THIS PASS TESTING? THERE IS NO WARNING LIGHT AT ALL AND CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL DIE OR BE SERIOUSLY INJURED IF YOUR CAR JUST SHUTS OFF IN TRAFFIC. I AM GENUINELY CONCERNED FOR MY LIFE AND THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF OTHERS WHILE HAVING THESE FAULTY VEHICLES ARE ON THE ROAD. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ASAP AND ENGINES NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH ONES THAT DON'T BURN THROUGH FUEL LIKE THIS. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THE SAME ISSUE ONLINE.  *TR",

I HAD IT TOWED TO DEALERSHIP, AS I WAS RIGHTLY TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT, AND THEY SAID IT WAS A LOOSE ELECTRICAL SHIFTING WIRE. THEY STATED THAT THEY SECURED IT AND THAT IT SHOULD BE FINE. IT HAPPENED AGAIN TWO DAYS LATER, THIS TIME WITH NO DASHBOARD SCREEN INDICATION, ONLY THE D ON MY GEAR STICK FLASHED, AND I BROUGHT IT BACK. UPON INSPECTION THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT I WAS OUT OF OIL AND THIS WAS TRIGGERING THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I WAS 800 MILES OVER FOR AN OIL CHANGE (THAT I HAD SCHEDULED BUT WAS UNABLE TO DRIVE TO BECAUSE OF THE CAR MALFUNCTIONING) HOWEVER MY CAR HAD GIVEN ME NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER THAT IT NEEDED OIL. I NOW MUST GO BACK TO THE DEALER IN 1000 MILES FOR AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. DEALERSHIP PREDICTS I MAY POSSIBLY NEED A NEW ENGINE. MY CAR ALSO JERKS WHEN I SWITCH GEARS AND AT TIMES IT STRUGGLES TO START. EVEN IF THE ENGINE IS REPLACED THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE CAR ENGINE WON'T SEIZE AGAIN IF IT IS LOW ON OIL, OR THINKS IT IS, AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MANUALLY CHECK THE OIL OF A 2018 VEHICLE THAT I PURCHASED WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WAS SAFE AND RELIABLE. REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH CHRYSLER. I'VE OWNED JEEPS IN THE PAST THAT WERE GREAT AND LASTED FOREVER. THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD CONSIDER RECALLING THE WHOLE MAKE/MODEL FOR.

TRIED TO GET INTO DEALERSHIP ON MANY OCCASIONS BUT WAS TOLD THEY HAD NO LONER SO WHEN THE DISPLAY SCREEN WAS LOST, I RENTED A CAR AND WENT FOR SERVICE AT DANBURY DODGE.  WITHIN ONE HOUR THEY CALLED ME STATING THAT THE ENTIRE ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED. THAT IS A VERY SHORT TIME TO DETERMINE THIS,  VEHICLE ONLY HAS 16,000 MILES ON IT. THE NEXT WEEK I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS FIXED.  WHEN I DROVE IT HOME, I NOTICED A SOUND IN THE ENGINE AND A SHUTTERING THAT IT NEVER HAD.  WHEN MY HUSBAND GOT HOME, HE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD PUT BACK ANTI FREEZE, WHICH THEY DID NOT, BUT ALSO FOUND THAT THEY LEFT A 3' TOOL THAT WAS LAYING ACROSS THE BATTERY! IF THIS HAD FALLEN IT WOULD HAVE HIT THE BATTERY CONNECTIONS AND CAUSED A FIRE. I AGAIN WENT DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH THIS NEW PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THE NEW ENGINE MIGHT NEED TO BE REPLACED.  WE HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THE 2018 JEEP COMPASSES AND FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE ENGINES AND ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  THESE VEHICLES ACTUALLY CAN STOP RUNNING.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE ON ANY ROAD, ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY. I REQUESTED FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND THE JEEP CORPORATION TO BUY BACK THIS VEHICLE DUE TO THE NOW KNOWN SAFETY ISSUES.  BOTH HAVE REFUSED.  I TAKE CARE OF MY GRANDCHILDREN AND THIS REPRESENTS A HUGE ISSUE FOR OUR FAMILY.  I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES.

CHAMPION DEALER IN THE CITY OF DOWNEY CA AND CHRYSLER SEEM LIKE THEY DO NOT WANT TO HELP ME FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG ON MY CAR. I WILL PROVIDE SCREENSHOTS OF AN EMAIL I HAVE WITH CHRYSLER. PLEASE ADVICE ME ON THIS PROBLEM AND WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR ME TO DO. THANK YOU.",

TOOK 2 QUARTS OF OIL TO GET TO SAFE ZONE, OIL DRIPPING WAS NOTICEABLE UNDER CAR AND I BROUGHT BACK TO DEALER. GOT CAR BACK AND THEY NOTED NO OIL LEAK FOUND AND SAW SPILLED OIL AT FILLER SPOT. I PUT OIL IN THE CAR, THERE WAS NO OIL SPILLED AROUND THE FILLER.  WHEN I LOOKED, DEALERSHIP HAD TAKEN, WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN OILY RAG, AND WIPED ALL AROUND THAT AREA. THEN TRIED TO BLAME ME. GOT CAR HOME, OIL WAS STILL DRIPPING. CALLED, MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.  THEY THEN WROTE ON THE WORK ORDER \"VERIFIED, SERVICE MANAGER DOCUMENTED OIL UNDER VEHICLE.  THEY PUT DIE IN OIL, CLEANED UP PRESENT OIL ON OUTSIDE OF ENGINE. WENT BACK TO DEALER AFTER 300 MILES, OIL WAS DOWN HALF A QUART, BUT DEALER SAID NO LEAKS FOUND. WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR A NEW ENGINE TO BURN UP TO 1 QUART OF OIL PER 1000 MILES.  THIS MEANS THE ENGINE IS ALREADY SHOWING 1 QUART OF OIL APROX EVERY 600 MILES. NOW I HAVE TO DO AN \"OIL CONSUMPTION TEST\" EVERY 1000 MILES.  AFTER READING WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN LOW OIL PRESSURE HAPPENS, CAR SHUTTING DOWN AND LOCKING UP SO CANT BE DRIVEN, HAS HAPPENED.  ONCE AT A STOP LIGHT, THEN TRYING TO LEAVE A PARKING SPOT. I THOUGHT IT WAS OPERATOR ERROR AND I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG BECAUSE NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND CONTINUE. MY FAULT FOR NOT FOLLOWING UP WITH DEALER, HOWEVER IF HAPPENS AGAIN, CAR WILL BE JUST TOWED FROM SPOT.  TO ME, THIS IS AN ISSUE JEEP KNOWS ABOUT AND IS PUTTING PROFITS OVER LIVES. THE COST OF A LIFE IF THE CAR SHUTS DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY OR INTERSECTION WITH NO WARNING, IF FAR LESS THAN WHAT IT WILL COST THEM TO STEP UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT.

IT WOULDNT MOVE AND TOLD ME TO SHIFT GEARS THEN PRESS THE BRAKE AND START BOTTON. MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS WOULD NOT RESTART THE CAR. IT TOOK BETWEEN 5-7 MINUTES TO FINALLY START RUNNING, BUT GAVE NO INDICATION OF WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE A MILE TO MY DESTINATION WITHOUT ANY ISSUE, BUT WAS MOMENTARILY IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE AS THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN WITH NO NOTICE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I FOUND A WEBSITE CONTAINING OF HUNDREDS OF RECENT COMPLAINTS DESCRIBING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. JEEPS SOLUTION HAS BEEN THAT THE CARS ARE IN NEED OF OIL CHANGES, BUT YET FOR MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS, NO OIL WARNING LIGHT IS EVEN COMING ON. MY HUSBAND CHECKED MY OIL AND THERE BASICALLY IS NONE. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER WHO INFORMED ME THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS ISSUE AND IT NEEDS AN OIL CHANGE. I FIND THIS INCREDIBLY UNACCEPTABLE AND FEEL THAT JEEP IS IN OVER THEIR HEADS WITH HOW TO RESOLVE THIS FAULTY SYSTEM THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT AND WONT UNTIL FATALITIES ARE UNFORTUNATELY REPORTED. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER WHO SAID IT MAY NEED AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST DONE, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO REQUIRE ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS TO RUN A 'TEST'. I HAVE ALSO READ THAT THE ENGINE WAS DESIGNED TO SHUT OFF WHEN OIL IS LOW AND CHRYSLER CONFIRMED THAT. HOW DOES THIS PASS TESTING? THERE IS NO WARNING LIGHT AT ALL AND CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL DIE OR BE SERIOUSLY INJURED IF YOUR CAR JUST SHUTS OFF IN TRAFFIC. I AM GENUINELY CONCERNED FOR MY LIFE AND THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF OTHERS WHILE HAVING THESE FAULTY VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ASAP AND ENGINES NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH ONE THAT DONT BURN THROUGH FUEL LIKE THIS COMPASS WAS 'DESIGNED' TO.",

I COULD NOT DISENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO EVEN MOVE THE CAR OFF THE LANE OF THE HIGHWAY AND WAS NEARLY IN A CAR ACCIDENT. THE FIRST INCIDENT THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN FOR SERVICE AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED AN OIL CHANGE. I SAID SO WHILE I'M DRIVING, GETTING ON A HIGHWAY 1.5 MINUTES AFTER LEAVING MY HOME MY CAR WILL JUST SHUT DOWN? THE ANSWER WAS YES! UNACCEPTABLE!!

AGAIN TODAY AND CAR IS BEING TOWED TO DEALER. I HAVE UCONNECT AND RECEIVE EMAILS OF MY CAR DIAGNOSTICS. ONLY 3 DAYS AGO IT SENT A \"SUGGESTED\" OIL CHANGE.

(LUCKILY, I HAD NOT REACHED THE HIGHWAY AND WAS NOT IN DANGER OF BEING REAR-ENDED DUE TO THE SUDDEN LOSS OF ACCELERATION!)  I NOTICED THE PARKING BRAKE HAD ENGAGED AND I COULD NOT RELEASE IT.

I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND ON TWICE MORE UNTIL IT FINALLY ALLOWED ME TO SHIFT INTO DRIVE.  I ATTEMPTED A K-TURN IN A DRIVEWAY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY HOME, WHEN THE VEHICLE LOST POWER AGAIN, THE PARKING BRAKE ENGAGED AND THE LOW OIL LIGHT REAPPEARED.  I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND ON AND AGAIN I COULDN'T MOVE.  I WAITED FOR 5 MINUTES AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE AND SHIFT INTO REVERSE.  I SHIFTED TO DRIVE AFTER EXITING THE DRIVEWAY AND AFTER DRIVING 1/8 OF A MILE THE POWER FAILED AGAIN.  AFTER WAITING ANOTHER FEW MINUTES, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME TO PARK IN MY DRIVEWAY AND ASKED MY HUSBAND TO CHECK THE OIL.  THE OIL RESERVOIR WAS PRACTICALLY EMPTY!  WE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND WE WERE TOLD TO PUT SOME OIL IN IT AND DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A SERVICE APPOINTMENT.

I STARTED MY VEHICLE AND MADE IT ANOTHER 1/2 MILE BEFORE THE CAR TURNED OFF AND BRAKE ENGAGED AGAIN.  STARTED THE CAR AND MADE IT THE 10 MILES THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE TO WORK.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  LUCKILY I WAS NOT ON A HIGHWAY; THIS COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS!  AFTER THE 3RD DAY OF THIS HAPPENING, I WENT ONLINE TO RESEARCH.  APPARENTLY THE NEWER JEEP ENGINE DRINKS OIL.   AT THAT POINT, MY HUSBAND HAD TO ADD 3 QUARTS OF OIL!  AFTER ONLY 3,000 MILES!  I CALLED CHRYSLER THE NEXT DAY AND THEY TOLD ME TO DO AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST.  WHEN I TALKED TO THE SERVICE AREA AT THE JEEP DEALERSHIP THEY TOLD ME THAT 95% OF THE VEHICLES ON THEIR LOT HAVE THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE THAT DRINKS OIL. I ASKED IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE A RECALL AND THEY SAID THEY HADN'T HEARD THAT.  I ASKED THE WOMAN WHO IS MANAGING MY CLAIM AT CHRYSLER IF THEY CAN PUT THE OLD MOTOR IN MY VEHICLE, BUT SHE SAID I NEED TO GO THROUGH THE CONSUMPTION TEST BEFORE DETERMINING ANY SOLUTIONS.  FROM WHAT I\"VE BEEN READING, JEEP SEEMS TO BE DOING NOTHING ABOUT THIS. OTHER JEEP COMPASS DRIVERS DESCRIBE THEIR NEAR ACCIDENTS BECAUSE THEIR VEHICLE STOPPED ON A HIGHWAY.  I FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE CAUSES A HUGE SAFETY RISK.  NO ONE AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE MENTIONED THIS ISSUE; I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IF I KNEW THAT IT LITERALLY SHUTS DOWN.  I MENTIONED IT TO MY SALESMAN AND HE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE. I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT JEEP IS NOT RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE. *DT    'PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).'*JB",

DURING A HANDFUL OF THESE INSTANCES, I WAS IN A PARKING GARAGE, GAS STATION OR ON A SIDE STREET WHERE I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OVER AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

THEY SHOWED A PRINT OUT FROM THEIR SYSTEM THAT STATED MY CAR HAS 5 QUARTS OF OIL, AND EACH 1 QUART OF OIL SHOULD LAST ~5K MILES. THEREFORE, THE OIL SHOULD NOT BE LOW ENOUGH TO STALL AN ENGINE @ 6 MONTHS/5K MILES.    THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN A NEW VEHICLE. I HAVE NO INDICATION WHEN A PROBLEM EXISTS.

COLD AND VERY ANGRY I CANCELLED THAT TOW AND USED MY TRIPLE AAA AND MY LOCAL TOW GUY,(WHO HAD THE JEEP LOADED ON THE FLATBED IN HALF AN HOUR) AND DROVE ME AND MY JEEP TO MY DEALER. SERVICE IS TRYING TO FIX THE CAR. THEY HAVE HAD IT FOR 3 DAYS NOW AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND. JEEP PROVIDED A RENTAL FOR 1 WEEK. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE WITH THIS CAR.

THAT DID NOT HAPPEN, I CALLED THEM BACK AND WAS TOLD I WAS GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION AND THAT ACTUALLY THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME IN 24-48 HOURS. SO, I BETTER GET A PHONE CALL OR E-MAIL ON MONDAY.

THERE IS CONCERN THAT IN THE EVENT OF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT, THESE LOOSE FASTENERS COULD BECOME DISLODGED AND IMPALE PASSENGERS. BECAUSE OF THIS RECALL, THERE IS A FEDERAL STOP SALE ORDER ON ALL AFFECTED VIN #S. BEFORE I DEPOSITED ON THIS VEHICLE ON 11/24/17, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED SALESMAN IF THIS VEHICLE HAS THE RECALL. I WAS TOLD IT DID NOT. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 11/29/17 TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE AND PAID IN FULL. ON 11/30/17, ANOTHER SALESMAN CALLED ME AND SAID THIS VEHICLE IS ON THE RECALL LIST. HE THEN TOLD ME HE WANTED TO SEND A RUNNER TO MY HOUSE TO HAVE ME RESIGN MY SALE PAPERWORK WITH DIFFERENT DATES ON IT. THIS WAS ASKING ME TO SIGN FALSIFIED/FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS TO PREVENT THEM FROM LIABILITY FOR VIOLATING THE FEDERAL STOP SELL ORDER. I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT RESIGN ANY DOCUMENTS. I ALSO LEARNED THAT METRO HAS NOT REPORTED MY CAR AS SOLD TO JEEP. THE GENERAL MANAGER TOLD ME HE \"CAN'T REPORT IT\" AS SOLD. I FEEL THAT THEY CAN REPORT IT, BUT THEY AREN'T TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM FINES, ETC. FURTHERMORE, SINCE MY CAR HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AS SOLD, THERE ARE NUMEROUS OBSTACLES AROUND GETTING THE RECALL PERFORMED ON MY CAR. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THE RECALLED PART FROM MY CAR AND SHIP IT BACK TO CHRYSLER FOR INSPECTION. CHRYSLER WOULD THEN EITHER SEND A NEW REPLACEMENT PART OR RETURN THE EXISTING PART IF IT WAS DEEMED TO BE SAFE TO BE REINSTALLED IN MY VEHICLE. THE MANAGER STATED THEY WOULD PROVIDE ME A RENTAL CAR DURING THIS PERIOD. HOWEVER THE TIME FOR WHICH THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP MY CAR SEEMED UNCLEAR AND OPEN-ENDED.
