I WAS ABLE TO RESTART IT QUICKLY AND GET MOVING BEFORE BEING BUMPED FROM BEHIND.  BOUGHT THE BIKE (02/02/2019) AND IT NOW HAS 160 MILES ON IT. I AM THE SAME POSTER / SAME BIKE AS ABOVE (CLASSIFIED AS ELECTRICAL PROBLEM).  BIKE HAS DONE THIS ON TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AS NOTED.  COULD ALSO BE FUEL RELATED IF NOT ELECTRICAL.  I CAME HOME AND CHECKED THE VENT LINES FROM THE GAS TANK TO THE EVAP SYSTEM FOR KINKS, ETC.  TEMPORARILY DISCONNECTED AND RECONNECTED THE LINE THAT RUNS FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE GAS TANK TO THE CHARCOAL CANNISTER MOUNTED INSIDE THE SKID PLATE AND HEARD A \"WHOOSH' OF AIR.  SO, THE TANK IS EITHER UNDER VACUUM OR PRESSURE, WHICH COULD BE INTERRUPTING FUEL SUPPLY TO THE ENGINE.  I HAVE CONTACTED MY DEALER AGAIN (HAVE NOT HEARD BACK SINCE I FIRST CALLED EARLIER IN THE WEEK) AND THE DEALER IN WISCONSIN (GREAT FOLKS) AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM.  THEY WILL REPORTEDLY CALL THE ROYAL ENFIELD NORTH AMERICA HELP LINE AND GET ME SOME ANSWERS TOMORROW.  I CALLED THE NUMBER (CORRECTLY, DIALED THE SAME NUMBER SEVERAL TIMES) AND GOT A SURVEY ASKING MY AGE AND PROMISING A TRIP TO THE CARIBBEAN.  STAY TUNED.",

WAS OUT FOR A SHORT BREAK-IN RIDE ON COUNTRY ROADS WHEN THE ENGINE CUT OFF, BIKE WENT DEAD.  NO USER ERROR WAS INVOLVED.  NO ACCIDENTALLY HITTING THE KILL SWITCH, ETC.  I'VE BEEN RIDING FOR OVER 25 YEARS.  BOTH TIMES I HAD TRAFFIC BEHIND ME.  HAD TO PULL OVER QUICKLY SO AS TO NOT BE HIT FROM BEHIND.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO FIND ACCESSIBLE RUNOFF.  A LESSER RIDER WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS, OR WORSE.  SPEED RANGED FROM 15 TO 25 MPH WHEN THE BIKE CUT OUT AND WHILE IN RIGHT-HAND TURNS.  ONLY WAY TO RESTART IS TO TURN KEY TO OFF POSITION AND THEN RESTART.  THE BATTERY HAS A FULL CHARGE.  NOT SURE IF IT'S RELATED OR NOT BUT A REAR TURN SIGNAL WAS OUT ON THE BIKE WHEN I PICKED IT UP.  THE DEALER HAD TO SWAP IT OUT.  MUST HAVE BEEN MISSED DURING PDI (ODD GIVEN THE PDI IN TX AND AT THE DEALER).  WILL RIDE AGAIN (TO GET IT BACK TO THE DEALER) AND REPORT BACK.  HAVE CONTACTED MY DEALER AND REPORTED HE PROBLEM.",
