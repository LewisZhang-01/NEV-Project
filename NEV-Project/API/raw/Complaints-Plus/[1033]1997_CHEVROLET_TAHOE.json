I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THE NHTSA WEB SITE HAD POSTED A REMEDY:  REMOVE THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR AND CLEAN THE WHEEL SPEED SURFACE, GREASE THE MOUNTING SURFACE, REINSTALL THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR AND CHECK THE PEAK-TO-PEAK OUTPUT VOLTAGE TO ENSURE THE WHEEL SPEED SIGNAL IS WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS.  I TOOK A COPY OF THE REMEDY TO MY MECHANIC, WHO PROMPTLY FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTIFIED ME THAT THE REMEDY FAILED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I CONTACTED AN NHTSA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AND ASKED IF AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED REGARDING THIS DEFECT AND WAS INFORMED THAT THERE IS NO INVESTIGATION AS OF YET.

IF THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING IN VEHICLES (REGARDLESS OF THE YEAR MODEL) AND THE RECALL HAS BEEN LIMITED TO ONLY A FEW YEAR MODELS, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ABS SYSTEM FAILURE ON THE 1997 TAHOE IS NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN REGARDING SAFETY?

MY SENSE OF THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT THE VEHICLE IS \"STEERING ITSELF\" , BUT THAT THERE IS A SUDDEN CHANGE IN BOOST TO THE STEERING (DEFECTIVE SPEED SENSITIVE PWR STEERING?) AND SINCE THE DRIVER IS HOLDING PRESSURE ON THE WHEEL IN A CURVE, THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN STEERING BOOST CAUSES THE DRIVER TO  OVERSTEER  AND  THAN OVERCORRECTION IN STEERING, WHICH TO SOME COMPLAINANTS APPARENTLY IS PERCEIVED AS A LOSS OF STEERING.  MY WIFE PERCEIVES IT AS A LOSS OF STEERING  AND I DRIVE THE VEH AS MUCH AS HER AND CAN TELL YOU THE LOSS OF STEERING IS IN THE MIND DUE TO \"PUCKER FACTOR\"!     I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THE PROBLEM IS VERY REAL AND I HAVE HAD 1 OR 2 NEAR MISSES WITH A CAR AND JERSEY BARRICADE AS I OVERSTEERED WITH THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF BOOST.  WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN BOOST PROBABLY  OCCURS REGULARLY AT THE APPROPRIATE SPEED, ( AS DESIGNED INTO THE SPEED SENSITIVE STEERING SYSTEM),  BUT WHEN THE DRIVER HAS TURNING PRESSURE ON THE STEERING WHEEL,  AND THE NORMAL STEERING WHEEL BACK-PRESSURE IS SUDDENLY RELEASED (OR SIGNIFIGANTLY REDUCED)THE 1ST ACTION IS A SUDDEN OVERSTEER (AS THOUGH SOMEONE QUICKLY JERKED THE WHEEL LOOSE FROM YOUR HANDS IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU ARE ALREADY TURNING).  I SEE MANY SIMILIAR COMPLAINTS IN THE COMPLAINTS DATABASE AND A NHTSA ACTION # EA99011 OPEN INVESTIGATION SINCE MAY 12, 1999, SEEMS THAT  THIS IS A DEFINITE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO CASTLE ROCK, THEY COULDN'T REPAIR IT UNTIL A PART WAS ORDERED AND RECEIVED FROM DENVER, SO I RENTED THE LAST CAR RENTAL IN CASTLE ROCK AND DROVE HOME.

IT COST $130.90 IN SANTA FE TO REPLACE THE FILTER ($91.50 LABOR) AT THE SANTA FE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP.  THE COST TO REPLACE THE PUMP MODULE AND STRAINER WAS $533.80 ($232.00 LABOR) AT THE SOUTH STREET AUTOMOTIVE AS NO CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WAS AVAILABLE.  THE RENTAL CAR COST WAS APPROXIMATELY $300.00.

ON ONE OCCASION, FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL I WAS DRIVING AT APPROX 40 MPH ON A SUBURBAN ROAD (NO ICE OR SNOW) WHEN THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AHEAD CHANGED FROM GREEN TO RED. THERE WAS ONE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. I APPLIED THE BRAKES AS USUAL, AND THE ABS BRAKES ENGAGED. THE TRUCK SHUDDERED AND SHOOK AS I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FEELING WHEN THE ABS ENGAGE IN SNOW AND ICE. BUT THERE WAS NO STOPPING THE VEHICLE. I WAS FORCED TO SWERVE OFF THE RAOD TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS FAILURE HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES, BUT THE DEALER HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE FAILURE. OTHER CHEVY SERVICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE NOT FOUND THE PROBLEM. I CALLED GM AND WAS GIVEN A \"FILE NUMBER\":  980 496 553. BUT GM TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE HAD NO OTHER REPORTS OF FAULTY ABS AND THEY INSISTED THE DEALER IS THE PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THE TRUCK. MY TRUCK HAS SPENT MANY MANY WEEKS IN VARIOUS DEALERSHIPS, TO NO AVAIL. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NTSB HAS DOCUMENTED THOUSANDS OF SUCH FAILURES IN GM VEHICLES. BUT APPARENTLY NOT ON 1997 MODELS, ONLY 1992-96 MODELS. LET ME INFORM YOU THAT THE 1997 MODEL CHEVY TAHOE HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS THE VEHICLES THAT WERE MENTIONED IN NEWS REPORTS LAST WEEK, REPORTS THAT 3.5 MILLION GM VEHICLES ARE BEING RECALLED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. CAN YOU ADVISE ME WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO SINCE GM HAS CLOSED THE DOOR ON MY CASE AND INSISTS THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH MY BRAND NEW TRUCK. BY THE WAY, THIS PROBLEM SURFACED WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH THAT I OWNED THE TRUCK AND HAS OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY EVER SINCE. FURTHERMORE, MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRIVEN THE TRUCK HAVE REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO ME, SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH MY PERCEPTION OF HOW ABS BRAKES ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK, AS GM INSISTS. PLEASE ADVISE ME OF WHERE I SHOULD GO TO GET THIS MATTER SOLVED.",
