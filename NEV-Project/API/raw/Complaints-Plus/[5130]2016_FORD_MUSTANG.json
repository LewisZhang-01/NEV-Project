After visiting a dealer who wanted $500 to replace the camera, I watched this video from a Ford Master Mechanic to realize my problem (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Onbo8PgrY). Upon examination, I discovered that there were two zip ties, one in the trunk and the other at the body, severely restraining the free movement of the wiring as the trunk open/close. I clipped those zip ties and then carefully opened the wiring cover at the junction of the trunk and body. Several of the wires in the harness, including a coaxial cable, showed stripping of the wire's plastic cover and wire damage from the severe constraint caused by the tie's compression. This is clearly a factory manufacturing error and should be recalled for replacement or repair.",

Starting in April 2021, the passenger side door will become unlatched on it's own while driving even with doors locked. It doesn't open entirely but enough to trip \"door ajar\" light and interior lights. Since that time in April it happened in June of 2021 and again in August after which I took car to a dealer. Door came unlatched at normal speeds between 40 and 60 mph.  The car is under an extended warranty from Ford and the car now has approximately 37,000 miles on it. I am the original owner. The dealer kept car for about a weeks time and said they could not duplicate it. They told me warranty wouldn't honor it since they couldn't duplicate the issue and it would cost around $600 to fix possible issues. They asked me several questions implying I was imagining it or I didn't know what I was talking about. I've been driving for about 50 years.  Since August, it has happened 2 more times, once at highway speed on 10/17/21 and again yesterday, 01/11/21 also at highway speed. This time my son was sitting in passenger seat. He is a Ford trained mechanic although he doesn't work for Ford but works on  Ford police fleet cars.   I do believe this is a safety issue but Ford will not address the issue. I took it to Ford corporate and they backed the dealer. I believe it will only get worse as time progresses. Wouldn't cover under warranty  but if I wanted to pay they would do whatever I wanted them to do.",

In other cars you can just change gas cap for 20$  buh since in my case my car doesn't have gas cap i would have to replace the whole gas pipe filler and ford doesnt offer any gas cap for my car. I feel like if i do change my gas filler pipe , mabey couple years from now it's gona start giving same check engine problem. I also feel safety concern i do live in Arizona where gets really hot and with fuel vapor coming out capless filler it might cost a fire. I have 3year daughter that likes to ride in my mustang but i don't let her intill this gets fix i don't want her smelling gas .

I BELIEVE THERE IS POTENTIALLY A SAFETY ISSUE HERE WHICH WOULD WARRANT A RECALL. SINCE THE REFRIGERANT LEAKS INTO THE CABIN FROM THE EVAPORATOR CORE, THE WINDSCREEN FORMS A RESIDUE WHICH OBSTRUCTS DRIVER VISIBILITY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS GLARE FROM THE SUN. DRIVER VISIBILITY IS A FACTOR IN THE PROBABILITY OF AUTOMOTIVE ACCIDENTS, THEREFORE THE COMMONLY DEFECTIVE A/C SYSTEM DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE SAFETY OF THIS MODEL. TO MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE OF THE A/C SYSTEM, IT MUST BE TOPPED OFF. BUT VISIBILITY SUFFERS AND THE WINDSCREEN MUST CONSTANTLY BE CLEANED. ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT REFRIGERANT THAT IS LEAKED IS CHRONICALLY INHALED BY OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE TOXICITY OF R134A, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT IT BELONGS IN PEOPLES LUNGS. IF IS IT DANGEROUS TO DO SO, THEN I MUST REITERATE, THE COMMONLY DEFECTIVE A/C SYSTEM DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE SAFETY OF THIS MODEL. I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS ISSUE GETS MORE ATTENTION AND A SOLUTION IS PROPOSED. THANK YOU AND BEST REGARDS.  *TR",

DETERMINED THE PROBLEM WAS A FAULTY DRIVE SHAFT AND REPLACED IT TWICE AND INDEXED THE SECOND ONE AFTER INSTALLATION.  THE CAR STILL VIBRATES. THE TIRES WERE ROAD FORCED BALANCED AND ROTATED AND THE VIBRATION IS STILL HAPPENING. THIS LEADS ME AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER MALFUNCTIONING PARTS OR A POSSIBLE DESIGN FLAW IN THE DRIVE LINE WHICH I BELIEVE FORD MOTOR COMPANY KNOWS ABOUT. THE VIBRATION IS FELT THROUGH THE CAR AND THE REAR MIRROR IMAGE IS BLURRED WHILE DRIVING. A FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. HAS TOLD ME THIS VIBRATION IS \"NORMAL\" AND \"NO REPAIR IS NEEDED\". THEY REFUSE TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE FURTHER OR FIX THIS DEFECT.  I WONDER, IF IT IS NORMAL WHY DID THEY TRY TO FIX IT TWICE. IT APPEARS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS OR IF THEY WERE DESIGNED  SO A VIBRATION CAN SHAKE YOUR BODY WHILE DRIVING, AS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP IS IMPLYING, THEN THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OR NOTIFIED OF THIS VIBRATION CHARACTERISTIC BEFORE PURCHASING. NOTE, THAT WHILE THE SERVICE DEPT. WAS ATTEMPTING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM THE SHOP FOREMAN TOLD ME HE DROVE FOUR NEW CARS FROM THEIR STOCK AND FOUND 3 OF THEM TO HAVE THIS VIBRATION DEFECT. NOW IN MY VEHICLE IT APPEARS THAT THE VIBRATION IS CAUSING THE REAR AXLE DIFFERENTIAL SEAL TO START LEAKING. I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT A INVESTIGATION BE STARTED INTO THIS MATTER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OR NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SENSATION.  REGARDLESS FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD BE MADE TO FIX THESE DEFECT ON ALL VEHICLES AFFECTED OR REFUND THE CONSUMERS THE PURCHASED PRICE OF THE VEHICLE IF THEY CANNOT FIX IT.",
