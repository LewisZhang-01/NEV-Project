Damage occurs due to salt and other corrosive agents that are used for roads in Connecticut to melt snow. These agents rust the car where Mitsubishi failed to properly protect the steel under the rear end of the vehicle. It is widely observed that the 03-06 lancer has from factory a poor to almost no anti rust agent applied to the lower rear chassis area of the car where the subframe crossmember is located that holds suspension components and rear differential. Currently under nhtsa campaign 16V458000, there is a safety recall for the front subframe crossmember due to rust damage. As for the rear of the car there most certainly should be a safety campaign as the rust in this area develops quicker and can cause a catastrophic failure.",

BLAMED THE SHOP THAT REPLACED THE BULB, AND HAD THEM PUT IN ANOTHER. THEN WHEN DRIVING A LONG DISTANCE DRIVE, AS I BEGAN TO GET DARK, ANOTHER MOTORIST FLASHED ME TO NOTIFY ME THAT I DID NOT HAVE HEADLIGHTS ON, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IN THE ON POSITION. BOTH LOW BEAMS HAD GONE OUT AND WOULD ONLY WORK ON HIGH BEAMS. I WAS LUCKY THAT THE MOTORIST NOTIFIED ME, AND THAT THE LIGHTS DID NOT BLOW AFTER DARK WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN. TOOK TO SHOP, DIAGNOSTIC WAS RUN AND 1ST THOUGHT WAS THE ECU FOR HEADLIGHTS, ORDERED PART, INSTALLED AND 30 SECONDS AFTER RUNNING LIGHTS, BLEW THE NEW ECU PART. CURRENTLY ONLY 1 HEADLIGHT WORKS, AND ONLY ON HIGH BEAMS. SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT WORK EVEN ON HIGH BEAMS. IF UNPLUGGED & PLUGGED BACK IN, ONLY THEN WILL IT WORK, BUT ONLY ON HIGH BEAMS. THERE IS SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION, BUT MECHANICS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM. TAKING BACK AGAIN MONDAY 4/27 FOR ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO FIND THE PROBLEM. IN THE MEANTIME, I CONTINUE TO HAVE TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE VEHICLE, WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE ME TO DRIVE AFTER DARK. ALL MITZUBISHI DEALERS & SERVICE IN MY TOWN HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND THE CLOSEST DEALER IS 2 HOURS AWAY. I CANNOT AFFORD TO 1. TAKE THE TIME TO DRIVE IT DOWN. 2. GET A RENTAL CAR WHILE THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. I HAVE PURCHASED NUMEROUS BULBS PRIOR TO KNOWING THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE, AND HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON DIAGNOSTICS & ATTEMPTED REPAIRS. NONE OF THE OTHER ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS OF THE CAR HAVE FAILED. ONLY THE HEADLIGHTS. *TR",
