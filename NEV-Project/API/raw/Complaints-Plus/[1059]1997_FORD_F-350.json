WE WERE DRIVING AND GOT A TERRIBLE SHIMMY AND THE VEHICLE BECAME DIFFICULT TO DRIVE.  SUDDENLY, BOOM, ANOTHER REAR DUEL TIRE WENT.  I AGAIN MANAGED TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD AND GOT IT CHANGED.  FIRESTONE WOULDN'T GIVE ME A NEW TIRE ON THIS ONE.  THEY ALLOWED A REPLACEMENT VALUE.  I AM DISGUSTED WITH FIRESTONE TIRES.

THE DEALER HAS MADE MANY, MANY UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  SINCE THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, WHEN THE FORD REP WAS CALLED AND CAME TO INVESTIGATE THE BRAKES WERE WORKING FINE AT THAT TIME.  WE HAVE TRIED TO GET THEM TO TAKE THE VEHICLE AND DRIVE IT FOR MORE THAN 5 MINS. TO CHECK IT AND HE SAID HE DID NOT HAVE TIME.  WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE DEALER UNTIL WE FEEL WE CAN NO LONGER DRIVE THIS VEHICLE.  IT IS UNSAFE.  SEVERAL PEOPLE AT THE DEALERSHIP HAVE DRIVEN IT AND HAVE HAD THE BRAKES LOCK UP BUT NOT THE PERSON IN \"AUTHORITY\" TO REPORT TO FORD.  EVEN AN OUTSIDE SERVICE PERSON HAS DRIVEN IT AND EXPERIENCED THE LOCKING UP OF THE BRAKES.  WE ARE SEEKING LEGAL COUNSEL AT THIS POINT SINCE WE ARE GETTING NO HELP.  WE HAVE TRIED TO GET FORD TO BUY BACK THE VEHICLE AND THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO DO THIS AT THIS POINT.  SO I HAVE REQUESTED AN ARBITRATION PACKAGE FROM THE FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER TODAY.  THEY REFUSED TO SEND ME COPIES OF THE REPORTS I HAVE CALLED IN TO THEM CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM TOO.  SO IT LEAVES ME NO CHOICE BUT TO MOVE ON.  FORD HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO LISTEN.
