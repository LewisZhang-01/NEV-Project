        "summary": "My vehicle has a problem with delayed acceleration and excessive acceleration.  When releasing my foot from the brake pedal then pressing on the gas pedal, the vehicle doesn't always accelerate when the gas pedal is pressed.  There seems to be a few second delay and then all of a sudden there is too much acceleration.  We've reported this to our dealership several times.  Several of their employees told us that this is just the nature of the 9 speed transmission.  We've also reported it to Honda's corporate service and they didn't acknowledge any problems.  They were plenty nice but lacked what I felt was the drive to help.  Their time between my report and their follow up was terribly long.  There are multiple reports of the same exact thing online so I know it's not exclusive to us.  This is an absolute safety issue as the delayed acceleration can cause us to get hit from behind and also mess up our timing as we move along w/ traffic.  The excessive acceleration is a safety issue in that it may cause us to hit a vehicle or something in front of us as the vehicle jolts.  Overall, the vehicle is fantastic other than this issue.  I've told the dealer and Honda as such.  This has gone on since owning the vehicle and even this morning, 4/5/2022, with approximately 53k miles on the vehicle.  Fortunately, we haven't had any accidents and I hope there is never an accident with us or any other 2019 Honda Odyssey owners....thus my reason for sending this message.  Thank you for your consideration.",

I suspect that the problem is related to the transmission because of how you reach the point where it chokes.  Plus the two dealers it was sent to for repair hinted to me that the issue is the new style transmission. Here's one typical example.  Sitting at an intersection waiting to turn left.  If I take my foot off the brake and apply my foot to the gas pedal without hesitation it typically works fine.  However, if I touch the gas, back off the pedal then hit the gas pedal again, I'm left in the intersection not moving for a few seconds.  This has become critically dangerous. I have taken my vehicle to two Honda dealers within the first 10,000 miles.  I explained the problem and both dealers said the exact same thing.  \"Yes, we hear this from all the customers with that transmission.  It's normal and nothing can be done to correct it.\"  They did nothing further for it. Since the dealer made no diagnosis of it the manufacturer will not address it.

This time, there was no car, just an open foggy road and this large metal plate on the road.  However, as I got closer to the metal plate, suddenly my brakes fully locked up and the vehicle went into an emergency full stop.  I was pushing on the accelerator but it would not go and the vehicle came to a complete and sudden stop.  Thankfully no one was behind me, or I would have gotten into an accident.  Then the vehicle started to move again and has been totally fine since.  But, what is this all about?  It seems the emergency braking mode kicked in but it should not have, the road was wide open and the only thing unusual was a large metal plate covering some hole in the road.",

HONDA CALLED ME AND SAID THAT IT IS NORMAL. I OWNED SEVERAL CARS BEFORE, HONDA AND OTHER BRANDS, AND NEVER EVER HAD AN ISSUE HURTING MY HEAD ON THE LIFTGATE. I AM 6FT 1IN. THIS ISSUE IS AN INNJURY HAZARD. HONDA NEEDS TO ADMIT TO THIS AS EITHER AN ENGINEERING OR DESIGN OVERSIGHT, OR A BAD DECISION, WITH THE NON-POWER EX TRIM LIFTGATE. THE POWER LIFTGATE TRIMS (MORE EXPENSIVE) DO OPEN HIGHER THAN 6 FT, SO CLEARLY IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX THE ISSUE. I ALSO CHECKED THE 2021 ODYSSEY MODELS TODAY AT THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP - HONDA DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE: THE EX NON-POWER LIFTGATE STILL OPENS AT A SIMILAR 5'10'' WHILE THE MORE EXPENSIVE EX-L POWER LIFTGATE OPENS BEYOND 6'3''.

PEASE LOOK INVESTIGATE ON THIS PROBLEM BECASUSE APPARENTLY NOTHING HAS BEEN ISSUED TO RECALLS NOR COVERED WARRANTLY ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS ONLY LAST YEAR'S MODEL 2019!",

THE VEHICLE WAS THEN BRIEFLY PUT INTO DRIVE FOR A COUPLE INCHES FORWARD BACK INTO THE GARAGE WITH VERY LITTLE POWER ON ACCELERATION AND AN EVEN STRONGER BURNING SMELL. THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED AND ADVISED HAVING THE CAR TOWED IN TO BE EVALUATED. UPON EVALUATION THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE ISSUE WAS A LEAKING FUEL INJECTOR CAUSED BY A FAULTY FUEL RAIL DESIGN FROM THE FACTORY. THE INJECTOR LEAK CAUSED TOO MUCH FUEL TO BE PUT INTO THE CYLINDER CAUSING THE SPARK PLUGS TO FOWL OUT. THE DEALER STATED HONDA WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUE ALSO IN 2018 MODELS AND THEY ASSUMED THEY WOULD HAVE CORRECTED THE FUEL RAIL DESIGN FOR THE 2019 MODEL. THE DEALER THEN ADVISED THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE ANY REPAIR UNTIL THE REDESIGNED FUEL RAIL WAS RELEASED A MONTH FROM NOW. THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW 2 MONTHS AGO AND CURRENTLY HAS APX 5,000 MILES. THE FACT THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY AN ERROR IN THE FUEL RAIL DESIGN FROM THE FACTORY INDICATES THE PROBLEM LIKELY HAS BEEN CAUSING DAMAGE AND POSING A SAFETY RISK OF POSSIBLE ENGINE FIRE FROM THE LEAKING FUEL INJECTOR THE ENTIRE 5,000 MILES OF OWNERSHIP. ALSO, IT IS UNKNOWN HOW THE LEAK MAY AFFECT THE ENGINE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE LEAK AND DESIGN FLAW PERSISTING SINCE IT WAS SOLD NEW FROM THE FACTORY.",
