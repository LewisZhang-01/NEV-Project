NO AIR BAG WAS EVER DEPLOYED WHEN HE HIT THE CURB AND SIGN WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS HE HIT A SIGN AND TREE STRIPPING THE FRONT BUMPER OFF AND  CRUSHED THE RADIATOR INTO THE ENGINE. NO AIR BAGS WEAR EVER DEPLOYED. EVEN THE POLICE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND QUESTIONED IT . IT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF HURST TEXAS. IN THESE FORUMS MANY DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF ENGINE FAILERE AND BRAKES IN SOME CASES. HONDA JUST PUT OUT A RECALL ON 1998-2000 FOR THE ENGINE IGNITION SWITCH SHORTING OUT CAUSING ENGINE FAILERE. I SUGGEST THEY INCREASE THAT RECALL TO 2002 POSSIBLY. ALSO I READ WHERE THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR IS GETTING WET AND SHORTING OUT CAUSING THE SAME THING IN SOME CARS. IN ONE CASE I READ THAT THE VACUMM HOSE TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER MAY BE BAD. PUMPING THE BRAKES CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. SO ANY CASE I THINK HONDA HAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH ENGINES STALLING WHILE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING. MY SON WAS LUCKY HE WAS ONLY DRIVING 15 MPH WHEN IT HAPPENED . IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE.

I WAS IN LONG BEACH AT THE INTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE AND MENTIONED IT TO A HONDA REPRESENTATIVE, WHO PASSED ME ALONG TO \"THE NATIONAL SERVICE MANAGER\", TO WHOM I ALSO TOLD MY STORY TOO. THEY WERE IN DENIAL, SAID THEY HAD NO OTHER COMPLAINTS, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. TO REMEDY THE SITUATION ON MY OWN, I PAID FOR AND INSTALLED AN EXHAUST FROM ANOTHER HONDA MODEL THAT EXITS THE BIKE LOWER.
