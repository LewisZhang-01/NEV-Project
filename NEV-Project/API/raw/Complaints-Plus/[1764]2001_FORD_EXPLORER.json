SHE SAID THE TRUCK WAS BUCKING WILDLY AS THOUGH IT WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN IT'S 30 MPH SPEED. SHE PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND PULLED OVER YET THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO IDLE AS THOUGH IT WERE DRIVING 30 MILES PER HOUR. SHE TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF. I ARRIVED 15 MINUTES LATER AND WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL TURNED THE VEHICLE ON AND IT IMMEDIATELY REV'D AS SHE DESCRIBED SO I SHUT IT OFF. I THEN PUMPED THE GAS PEDAL (WITH THE TRUCK IN THE OFF POSITION) ASSUMING IT MAY BE STUCK THEN RESTARTED THE VEHICLE. IT STARTED AND SUBSEQUENTLY DROVE NORMALLY. I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE DISCOVERED NOTHING. NOTHING IN THE COMPUTER HISTORY AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SPEED SYSTEM (PEDAL, CABLE, THROTTLE, THROTTLE BODY...) I DID SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE AND DISCOVERED AN NHTSA REPORT (NHTSA ACTION NUMBER : PE05037) OF A POSSIBLE BAD SPEED CONTROL CABLE FOR THIS VEHICLE WHERE THE TEFLON COVER COULD COMES OFF AND BIND AT THE GAS PEDAL HOLDING THE PEDAL OPEN AND UNABLE TO RETRACT. WE ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE THE REPLACEMENT CABLE ONLY TO FIND THAT FORD NO LONGER MAKES THE ORIGINAL OR THE REPLACEMENT WHICH WE FIND UTTERLY UNBELIEVABLE. NO MORE EXIST ANYWHERE IN THE US. I CAN FIND PARTS FOR MY 1992 FORD MUSTANG EASIER. NOT SURE WHY THEY STOPPED MAKING THE CABLE WHICH MAKES THIS MORE INTERESTING. MY NEXT STEP IS TO HAVE MY MECHANIC REMOVE THE CABLE TO SEE IF THERE IS A TEFLON BUILD UP NEAR THE GAS PEDAL. NOTE: WE HAVE NO CLEAR PROOF THAT THE CABLE IS THE ISSUE YET AT THIS POINT THE FACT THAT IT CLEARED WHEN I PUMPED THE GAS PEDAL WITH THE VEHICLE IN THE OFF POSITION LEAVES SUSPICION THAT THIS COULD BE THE SAME ISSUE NOTED IN THE NHTSA PE05037 REPORT.  *TR",

I COULD NOT OPEN IT WITH THE REMOTE LOCK CONTROL, THE INNER LOCK CONTROL OR THE KEY.  I COULD NOT LIFT THE LOCK KNOB ON THE DOOR MANUALLY.  THE ONLY WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR WAS TO CRAWL IN FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE, REACH OVER THE CONSOLE AND PULL ON THE DOOR HANDLE, WHICH SOMETIMES CREATED A GRATING SOUND.  OCCASIONALLY THE REMOTE LOCK CONTROL WOULD WORK BUT VERY RANDOMLY.  99% OF THE TIME THE LOCK WOULD REMAIN STUCK.  WHEN IT DID WORK, I NOTICED IT WAS ONLY IF I LOCKED THE DOOR WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL.  IT NEVER WORKED IF I LOCKED THE DOOR WITH THE INNER LOCK CONTROL ON THE DOOR.  THE NEAREST FORD DEALER IS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY ROUND TRIP, SO I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A BROKEN DOOR HANDLE.  I PAID $92.87 TO REPLACE THE HANDLE, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED.  THE MECHANIC THEN TOLD ME HE WOULD HAVE TO ORDER MORE PARTS, WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD.  I HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS INCONVENIENCE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND RECENTLY I BEGAN RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON-LINE.  IT APPEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS.  ACCORDING TO THE DATA BASE, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED LOCK FAILURES ON MULTIPLE DOORS OF THE SAME VEHICLE.

I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT NORMAL, SO I PROCEEDED TO PULL OVER.  I THEN TOOK THE TRUCK TO A MECHANIC NEAR MY LOCATION.   THE MECHANIC AFTER EXTENSIVE DIAGNOSIS DETERMINED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER HAD FAILED, ALONG WITH TIMING CHAIN GUIDES WHICH SHATTERED INTO MULTIPLE PIECES (PHOTOS AVAILABLE).  THE TIMING CHAIN AND ITS COMPONENTS ARE SUPPOSE TO LAST FOR A LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE, AND HENCE FORD PROVIDED NO INFORMATION OR PROVISION FOR ITS MAINTENANCE.   THE REPAIR WAS EXPENSIVE, BECAUSE IT REQUIRED THE REMOVAL OF THE ENGINE WHICH IS BASED ON THE SOHC DESIGN HAVING ITS RIGHT CAMSHAFT DRIVEN BY A TIMING CHAIN LOCATED BEHIND THE ENGINE NEAR THE FIREWALL.  A RECALL OF THE TIMING CHAIN GUIDES AND TENSIONER SHOULD BE MADE BECAUSE OF THE COMMON PROBLEM THIS HAS BEEN FOR THIS ENGINE DESIGN, SOHC 4.0L     AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE ENGINE AND TIMING CHAIN GUIDE REPLACEMENT, MY VEHICLE BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  THE TRANSMISSION REGISTERED AN ERROR ON MY DASHBOARD, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN EXPERT, REQUIRED A TRANSMISSION REBUILD.   THE COST OF THE ENGINE AND THE TRANSMISSION REBUILD HAS BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE TO SAY THE LEAST.  THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF THIS FAILURES WOULD COMPROMISE SAFETY DURING HIGH SPEED OPERATIONS.  I HOPE NHTSA WILL REVIEW COMPLAINTS REGARDING TIMING CHAIN AND TRANSMISSION FAILURES, WHICH SHOULD REVEAL A PATTERN OF DESIGN FAILURES AT FORD.

A FEW MONTHS AGO I STARTED HEARING AN ANNOYING SQUEAKING NOISE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE. I LOOKED UNDERNEATH IT WHEN I GOT HOME. THE BUSHINGS THAT GO IN THE MOUNTS TO SECURE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK TO THE FRAME ARE DETERIORATING. YOU CAN ACTUALLY TOUCH THEM AND THEY WILL FALL APART. I CHECKED WITH A FEW LOCAL AUTO PART STORES AND ALL OVER THE INTERNET TO FIND THAT THOSE BUSHINGS ARE A DEALER ITEM, AND COST ABOUT $35 EACH.  ON THE INTERNET I ALSO FOUND THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THESE VEHICLES FOR THE BUSHINGS TO GO BAD. ON EACH CAB MOUNT ON THE FRAME; THERE IS AN UPPER AND LOWER BUSHING. ALL OF THE BUSHINGS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE ARE EITHER BAD OR GOING BAD. I CAN'T FIND ANY RECALL FROM FORD ON THESE BUSHINGS. I TOOK MY TRUCK TO A LOCAL MECHANIC SHOP, AND THEY SAID IT WOULD BE AROUND $600 TO REPLACE THESE BUSHINGS. THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT IF THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK COULD SHIFT WHEN TURNING OR ON BUMPY ROADS. I FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE BUSHINGS SINCE IT IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM. I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE CAB MOUNT BUSHINGS OR KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS HAD TO; EXCEPT ON A FORD EXPLORER SPORT TRAC. I CURRENTLY STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO EVEN PURCHASE THE BUSHINGS DUE TO FINANCIAL ISSUES. I AM A DO-IT-YOURSELFER AND COULD REPLACE THESE ON MY OWN IF I COULD AFFORD THEM. I FEEL THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. FORD SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL ON THE AFFECTED MODELS OF THE FORD EXPLORER SPORT TRAC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. *TR",

THE PART # IS SW-6350 THE LOCAL DEALER HAS 21 OF THESE SWITCHES IN STOCK TODAY. BECAUSE FORD HAS NOT ALLOWED THE USE OF THIS PART IN ITS RECALL, WE THE CONSUMERS ARE LEFT IN A POSITION OF EITHER NOT USING SOMETHING WE PAID FOR OR RISKING A FIRE. I AM APPALLED BY THE LACK OF ACTION ON THIS MATTER. I BELIEVE THAT THE NHSTA NEEDS TO APPLY THE PRESSURE TO FORD TO RESOLVE THIS INACTION. THERE IS AN HOW TO ARTICLE AT MYSPORTAC.COM.

THE FORM STATED THAT THE ORIGIONAL OWNER WAS COMPLAINING OF THE ABS SYSTEM NOT PROPERLY WORKING. THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE AND THE FORD FORM STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND WAS IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION. A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER I EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH THE ABS SYSTEM NOT WORKING AND A LIGHT ON THE DASH INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I CONTACTED THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT A FORD DEALER. I CONTACTED MCGUIRE FORD IN ITHACA NEW YORK AND THEY RAN A REPAIR HISTORY ON THIS VEHICLE, WHICH SHOWED NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ABS SYSTEM. MCGUIRE FORD STATED THAT THEY HAD TO ORDER PARTS FOR THE ABS SYSTEM. A WEEK LATER MCGUIRE FORD REPLACED PARTS FOR THE ABS SYSTEM. A FEW DAYS LATER I HAD TROUBLES WITH THE ABS SYSTEM AGAIN AND CONTACTED SIMMONS ROCKWELL FORD IN HORNELL NEW YORK. I DROPPED THE VEHICLE OFF FOR REPAIRS ON 4/1/04 AND PICKED IT UP 0N 4/2/04. ON 4/2/04 I EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE SYSTEM AGAIN. I CONTACTED SIMMONS ROCKWELL HORNELL SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND ASKED THEM IF IT WAS ALRIGHT IF I USED ANY FORD DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS AS THEY WERE 45 MILES AWAY FROM MY HOME. THEY INDICATED YES THAT ANY FORD DEALER WOULD HONOR THE WARRANTY,SO I WENT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER. THIS DEALER REFUSED TO DO REPAIRS DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND PAST PROBLEMS WITH SIMMONS ROCKWELL.     THIS VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 29,000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE NOT OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR A MONTH AND I HAD TO HAVE UNSUCCESSFUL REPAIRS MADE. THE FIRST PAYMENT IS DUE ON 4/13/04.

HIT A PIECE OF DEBRIS (MORE SOLID THEN TIRE PIECES) IN ROAD WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BLOWN OUT RIGHT, REAR TIRE (UNCLEAR IF CAUSE OF ACCIDENT OR DURING ROLLOVER). TRUCK THEN STARTED TO FISHTAIL IN THE LANE. APPLIED BRAKES (WHICH DID NOT LOCK UP - GOOD PERFORMANCE), ALSO NO SKID OCCURRED. THE ACCIDENT LOCATION WAS A FREEWAY UNDERPASS, LEFT LANE WITH A GUARDRAIL VERY CLOSE TO SHOULDER AND WAS PAVED TO THE RAIL EDGE. AS I WAS FIGHTING FOR CONTROL, THE FRONT, LEFT BUMPER HIT THE RAIL. TRUCK THEN ROLLED OVER TWICE AND DID AN ADDITIONAL 180 DEG TURN. I VERY STRONGLY FEEL THAT WITH THE EXCELLENT ROAD CONDITIONS, PROPER SAFETY OF THE GUARD RAIL, RELATIVELY LOW AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DUE TO THE IMPACT ITSELF, ETC, THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE TRUCK AND THAT THE ROLLOVER WAS AN EXCESSIVE, DANGEROUS REACTION WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. THE CARGO IN THE BACK BED WAS CENTERED FORWARD AND COMBINED WITH THE ITEMS INSIDE DID NOT EXCEED 600 POUNDS + 125LB DRIVER (WELL WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS OF TRUCK). BED HAD A DEALER INSTALLED, FIBERGLASS TOPPER. I WILL GIVE THE CAR CREDIT FOR KEEPING ME SAFE DURING THE ROLLOVER.

GAS TANK ALSO RUPTURED, SPILLING 19 GALLONS ON ROADWAY, BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. PHOTOS ARE AVAILABLE. I UNDERSTAND AFTER TALKING TO DEALER MANAGEMENT THAT THE SPORT TRAC MODELS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO HAVE THE ROLLOVER HISTORY OF THE ENCLOSED EXPLORERS BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY SHARE THE SAME STABILITY PROBLEMS.*AK",
