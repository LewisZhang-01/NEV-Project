My SUV failed to accelerate and the check engine light started flashing. Thankfully, I was able to maneuver and exit the interstate as soon as possible and waited two weeks for an appointment at my local dealer. I did not drive the car on the interstate during this two weeks. I am told that my engine is misfiring and they are going to try to figure out why. My car (that is barely 5 years old - purchased 2/14/17) has both transmission failures and engine problems. And the air conditioner failed. The list goes on and on. NHTSA please check into accidents involving chevrolets. I could easily have died on the interstate two weeks ago and no one would have known that it was because my car would not accelerate. I am thankful to be alive after so many close calls with this car, but also fearful for my safety and others.",

Wipers continue to run for a short time after turning off and then stop/park in the incorrect location Engine stall and loss of steering almost caused a collision putting mine and others lives at risk. This has happened seven times since I bought the car  in July 2021. No warning its going to happen other than dash lights flicker , warning lights on, steering fails, car dies, won't restart. GM has a Technical Service Bulletin #18-NA-161 .  I hope you can do something about this serious problem before someone is serious hurt or dies. Thank you",

BEFORE MY LAST TRIP, I SENT MY SUBURBAN AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR A 100K MILES SERVICE AT 99836 MILES WHERE I WAS IN WARRANTY WHERE THEY CHECKED AND SAID EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE FOR THE TRIP AND DID A BASIC OIL CHANGE WITH INSPECTION BUT AFTER A WEEK OF TOURING THE TRANSMISSION BOKE DOWN AT AROUND 101250 MILES. WHERE I HAD TO SHELL OUT $6200 IN TOTAL AS THE CAR WENT OUT OF WARRANTY IN A WEEK TIME. THE BREAK DOWN IS $4500 FOR REPAIRS, $850 FOR SHIPPING THE CAR, $500 IN CAR RENTAL AND HOTEL, $350 BROKEN WINDSHIELD IN TRANSIT.   BOTH OF MY CARS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO DEALERSHIP FOR THE SERVICE AND PERIODIC MAINTENANCE BUT ITS THEIR DEFECTED TRANSMISSION THAT WOULD NEVER HOLD UP.
