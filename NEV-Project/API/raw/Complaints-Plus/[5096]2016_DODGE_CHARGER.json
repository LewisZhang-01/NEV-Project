THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR IS ALSO BROWN/BURNED NEAR A COUPLE OF THE PROBES INDICATING THE GAS IS CAUSING A SHORT WITHIN THE PLUG!!

RESEARCHING ONLINE I SEE MULTIPLE OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS THAT THE PLASTIC TOP OF THE PUMP CRACKS, AND THERE IS EVEN A WEBSITE THAT SELLS A METAL COVER TO HELP PROTECT THE FUEL PUMP COVER! I SEE MULTIPLE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION IN CHRYSLER VEHICLES AND YET NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT. THE MORE RESEARCH I'M DOING ONLINE THE MORE REPORTS I AM FINDING REGARDING FIRES OCCURRING IN MINOR COLLISIONS THAT SHOULD NOT END THAT WAY.

THE DEALER ALSO TOLD MY WIFE THAT WE WERE THE SECOND OWNERS. I HAD TO BUY A CARFAX REPORT TO FIND OUT AND ARGUE WITH THE DEALERSHIP THAT I WAS THE 3RD OWNER. MY WIFE BOUGHT THE HELLCAT 9/2/2018 AND I HAD IT BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP 9/14/2018 FOR MULTIPLE ISSUES 1. RATTLING IN THE FRONT EVERY TIME DRIVE OVER A BUMP 2. THE VEHICLE WOULD PULL TO THE RIGHT. 3. A PIECE OF PAINT ON THE BACK BUMPER WHERE THE TRUNK MET THE BUMPER HAD DAMAGE. 4. TIRES WHERE BALLED ON THE INSIDE TIRE AND LESS THAN 1/32 ON THE OUTSIDE TIRE. ALL THESE ISSUES WERE A FIGHT AND SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED, THE DEALERSHIP KNEW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND I STILL HAD TO FIGHT, I ENDED UP PAYING FOR 2 TIRES THE DEALERSHIP HAD MY CAR FOR 49 DAYS AT THE CROWN MOTORS OF REDDING. THE ONLY ISSUES RESOLVED WAS THE TIRES AND PAINT CHIP. THEN 11/12/18 TO 12/3/2018 THE CAR WAS BACK IN THE SHOP A SECOND TIME FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AT THE DODGE ROSEVILLE AUTO MALL TO FIX THE RATTLING PROBLEMS IN THE FRONT. IN BETWEEN THE DATES FROM 11/12 ' 12/3 THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME UP AND SAID MY VEHICLE WAS READY. MYSELF AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TEST DROVE IT AND DISCOVERED THAT THE NOISE WAS STILL NOT FIXED. 12/3/2018 WE DROVE IT AGAIN AND THE NOISE WAS FINALLY FIXED BUT THE PULLING TO THE RIGHT STILL APPEARED TO STILL BE HAPPENING. I WAS TOLD THAT'S COMMON AFTER A WHEEL ALIGNMENT I WANTED TO DISAGREE, BUT I HAD NO MORE FIGHT LEFT IN ME ESPECIALLY AFTER FINDING OUT ABOUT MY WIFE'S MEDICAL PROBLEMS.
