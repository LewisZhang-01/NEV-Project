I waited 30 minutes, unlocked the steering wheel and was able to start the vehicle and EPC light turned off. I took it into Volkswagen dealership to have it looked over and they could not duplicate the issue nor find cause for lower fuel efficiency. The issue with fuel persisted intermittently. Then at 57k, while driving long distance, I noticed what seemed like misfiring when accelerating above 65 mph. There were no noises, no warning lights, and fuel efficiency seemed about the same. I continued driving and about 6 hours into my drive, EPC light came on, RPM's shot up to 4,000 and car began violently shaking while losing significant power and dropped down to 30 mph. I was in the left lane when it occurred and had to quickly move over to the right lane. The car then could not exceed 40 mph with the pedal held to the floor. I turned on my hazards while I continued driving an additional 30 miles to the nearest Volkswagen dealership. Because of how heavy the traffic was and the high speeds of the travelers, it put myself and my passengers at risk from not being able to accelerate, along with the other drivers having to either brake hard or quickly change lanes to avoid my car. At the Volkswagen dealership, diagnosis found code p0204 cylinder 4 injector. They confirmed 4th cylinder misfiring and replaced the fuel injector harness. Since that repair, my car has been shaking at idol, when initially taking off, and if I turn of the start/stop function.",

The VW dealership wanted an additional $400.00 (for a total exceeding $500) to provide both services. I am concerned about this 1) because VW does not communicate that this is a limitation of the ACC system, and 2) while an alignment should be the customer's responsibility to pay for, calibrating the ACC system should not. Anyone could go get an alignment done at a tire or brake shop for about $100 - what happens if they try to use their ACC afterwards and an accident happens?

I suspected brakes.  Took vehicle to VW dealership who performed an inspection then reported (first explanation) that unknown material/debris had worked its way between rotor and pad resulting in significant wear & scoring of driver front rotor.  Dealership advised replacement of all 4 rotors and pads ($ 1,700+)!  When I questioned the replacement of ALL brakes, I was told (2nd explanation) the debris in the driver front brake had reduced braking efficiency such that the passenger front  brake had to compensate, which subsequently resulted in excessive pad and rotor wear/scoring at that site.  Okay, but then why the rear?  I was told (3rd explanation), that due to the decreased braking efficiency of BOTH front brakes, the rear brakes had to compensate and that the rear pads were at 5mm, and the rear rotors were warped beyond specifications.    I requested all parts be retained for my inspection.    Upon my later inspection, I saw that one pad from EACH side of the respective front calipers was substantially worn beyond the other pad.  I was told (4th explanation) the caliper pins may not have had sufficient lubrication thus one (inner) side of EACH front caliper was getting hung up - thus the excessive wear to only the inner pad on EACH front brake.  Similarly, the inner side of each rotor showed substantially more wear and \u201cdeep grooving\u201d.  Despite the clear evidence of caliper malfunction, warranty coverage declined - EVEN THOUGH the full factory warranty was still in full effect!  Outcome:  Paid for all new rotors & pads (no other feasible option).  Service manager recommended returning after 5000 miles to verify proper function of calipers.  But Service Manager advised that if the caliper issue IS found, at that time, \u201c(T)he calipers may need replacement manufacturer\u2019s warranty may apply.\u201d",

VEHICLE WOULD CYCLE THROUGH THE DOWN SHIFTING AND THE JUMP IN RPM, AND THEN SHIFTING BACK UP TO LOWER THE RPM BACK TO NORMAL. WITHIN 1.2 MILES, CAR CYCLED THROUGH THIS THREE TIMES, AND THAT WAS WHAT I COULD CAPTURE ON VIDEO! IT CONTINUED FOR 15-20 MILES BEFORE I COULD GET IT TO A VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP. FINALLY, THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE GAUGE SHOT UP AND SAT ABOUT MAXIMUM VALUE FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS AND THEN FELL BACK DOWN TO DEAD CENTER (NORMAL OPERATING TEMP). AT THAT POINT, I WAS ALREADY ON MY WAY TO VW TO DROP IT OFF. ABOUT 1 MILE FROM THE DEALERSHIP, I GOT THE \"CHECK COOLANT! SEE OWNER'S MANUAL.\" ALERT ON MY DASH EVEN THOUGH THE TEMP GAUGE WAS NORMAL AT THAT TIME. FINALLY GOT TO VW AND WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION THING WAS NORMAL (\"THEY LIKE TO HUNT A LOT\"). I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A SECOND. AFTER 18,000 MILES, I WOULD NOT ALL OF THE SUDDEN REALIZE THE TRANSMISSION DOING THAT. SHIFTING BY ONE OR TWO GEARS IS PROBABLY NORMAL FOR A DSG, AND I'M SURE THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING ALL ALONG - BUT IT IS SO SMALL THAT I DON'T NOTICE THE CHANGE.

THE SECOND DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE THE NOISE WAS WAS VERY CONCERNED.

THE SERVICE TICKET INDICATES THAT EXCESS WELDING SLAG WAS DISCOVERED BEHIND THE HEADLINER AND CURTAIN AIRBAG.  THE DEALER SAID THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE HERE.
