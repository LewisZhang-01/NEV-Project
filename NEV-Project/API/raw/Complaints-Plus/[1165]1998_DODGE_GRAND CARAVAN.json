I AM THE SECOND OWNER AND WHEN I DISCOVERED THE HORN DID NOT WORK. AFTER RESEARCHING AND SUBSCRIBING TO THE THE NHTSA RECALL ALERTS I DETERMINED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE CLOCK SPRING REPLACEMENT. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE REPLACEMENT CLOCK SPRING COULD HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE AS WELL, BECAUSE IT WAS DONE SO SOON AFTER THE RECALL WAS ISSUED.       I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE I LIVE AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ISSUED AND THEY WERE SORRY, BUT THEY COULDN'T REPLACE IT AGAIN. THEY SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED. I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED FROM ORIGINALLY.    EVEN WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD PAY THE COST OF THE REPAIR, THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED.     I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH IT BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH INVOLVED IN THE STEERING COLUMN THAT COULD GO WRONG AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO IT.    THE VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE AND HASN'T BEEN SINCE BEFORE AND AFTER I PURCHASED IT. MY CONCERN IS IF THE HORN DOESN'T WORK'THEN HOW CAN I BE SURE THE AIRBAG DOES.    I'M STILL DRIVING THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I CAN'T SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS CONDITION.     IS THERE NO RECOURSE IF THE VEHICLE AS NOT REPAIRED AS PER THE NHTSA'S  RECALL?

EVERY SINGLE PLACE KNEW THE ISSUE AND THEY ALL KNEW WHAT YEAR MY CAR WAS AND THEY COULD TELL ME HOW SEVERE THE TOWERS WERE BEFORE THEY EVEN LOOKED UNDER MY HOOD!!!!CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME IF CHRYSLER HAS MADE AN ATTEMPT TO ASSIST PAYING FOR THIS BLATANT MISTAKE THEY MADE IN MANUFACTURING? *TR",

HE HEARD THE RADIATOR BOILING LOUDLY, AND THEN THE CAP BLEW OFF WITHOUT BEING TOUCHED, GIVING HIM SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO HIS FACE AND CHEST.

THE COOLING FAN RELAY SYSTEM IS A FAULTY COMPONENT LISTED AS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FOR ALL CHRYSLER MINIVANS AND AS A RECALL ITEM ONLY FOR CERTAIN CHRYSLER MINIVANS.

THE VAN WAS TAKEN TO THE DODGE DEALER IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX IT WITHOUT AN $80.00 INSPECTION. THE PROBLEM PART IS A FAN RELAY. IT IS CALLED A SOLID-STATE SPEED CONTROL WHICH IS A COMPUTER UNIT CONTROLLING SEVERAL DEVICES ALTHOUGH DODGE CALLS IT A RELAY.

PEOPLE ON THE WEB SAY THAT THE BOILING OVER HAD GOT SO VIOLENT IN THE RADIATOR THAT IT MAY HAVE WORKED THE CAP LOOSE AND BLOWN IT OFF WHICH HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN.

WHEN I RE-OPENED THE LIFTGATE, THE PASSENGER SIDE STRUT SHOT THROUGH THE SPACE BETWEEN THE LIFTGATE AND THE ROOFLINE. IT WAS STILL SECURED BY THE LOWER BOLT, BUT THE TOP BOLT HAD SHEARED, JUST AS HAPPENED ON THE 1992 PLYMOUTH MODEL . HOWEVER, DUE TO DESIGN CHANGES IN THE AREA OF THE WHERE THE STRUT IS, THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THE STRUT TO GO BUT TO SCRATCH THE PAINT ON THE VEHICLE. THE 1992 PLYMOUTH HAD A \"POCKET\" THAT THE UPPER BOLT SAT IN AND IT WOULD FORCE THE STRUT INTO THE AREA BETWEEN THE ROOF AND ROOF LINER INSIDE THE VEHICLE. ON THIS 1998 DODGE, I HAD TO FORCIBLY REMOVE THE STRUT FROM THE LOWER BOLT, SINCE IT WAS ATTACHED WITH A STAR DESIGN HEADED BOLT, THEREFORE EFFECTIVELY RUINING THE LOWER PIVOT AREA OF THE STRUT. THIS IS THE FIFTH (5TH)  STRUT (1ST ON THE 1998) THAT I HAVE HAD FAILURE WITH, AND ALL HAVE BEEN TO BOLT FAILURE IN THE THREADED AREA OF THE BOLT.

I AM THANKFUL THAT IT WAS A CURB THAT I HIT. THIS OCCURRED NOT FAR FROM  A  MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE CHILDREN ALWAYS WERE . I  HAD MY MECHANIC LOOK AT MY VEHICLE, HE TOLD ME THAT THESE WERE THE WORST ENGINES EVER MADE,  HE ALSO ADVISED ME NOT TO REPLACE THIS ENGINE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH EXPENSE, BUT ALSO IT WAS LIKELY THAT I WOULD BE REPLACING IT AGAIN WITHIN A YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS THEY HAD. I CALLED SEVERAL REPAIR SHOPS, AUTO PART STORES, AND EVEN DODGE DEALERSHIPS INQUIRING ABOUT PRICES FOR REPAIR. EVERYONE WAS WELL AWARE OF THESE ENGINES CALLING THEM DEFECTIVE, EVEN MECHANICS AT THE DODGE DEALERSHIP. THERE ALSO HAS BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF THE NEWS MEDIA DOING STORIES ON THIS SITUATION. AUTO MAGAZINES(MOTOR MAGAZINE MOSTLY) WRITE STORIES ABOUT THESE DEFECTIVE ENGINES. THE STORIES WRITTEN INCLUDE THAT SEVERAL ENGINE SPECIALIST HAVE ASSESSED THE PROBLEM AND ALL HAVE CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT THESE ENGINES ARE DEFECTIVE AND IT IS 100% CHRYSLERS FAULT.  WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DAIMLER CHRYSLER HASN'T BEEN FORCED TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH DO TO CHRYSLERS NEGLECT.

NOTHING COULD BE FOUND WRONG AND WE WERE TOLD TO SIMPLY \"KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND BRING IT IN WHEN IT'S NOT WORKING.\"  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TWICE MORE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM -- SPEEDOMETER, TACH, OIL PRESSURE GAUGE -- ALL NOT WORKING, BUT THESE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, AIRBAG AND ABS LIGHTS ALL CAME ON AND STAYED ON.  THESE THREE TIMES THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER THIS EXTRA COVERAGE AND ALL THREE TIMES, WE WERE TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG!  THE LAST STRAW CAME ON OCTOBER 13, 2004 WHEN WE TOOK THE VAN IN FOR THE 4TH TIME FOR THE SAME PROBLEMS.  THIS TIME, WE WERE TOLD THERE WERE MASSIVE OIL LEAKS WHICH HAD SPRAYED OIL ON THE WIRE HARNESS, POSSIBLY CAUSING THE FAILURE OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  WE HAD THAT REPAIRED TO THE TUNE OF OVER $300.  THEN WE WERE TOLD THAT THE REASON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL FAILED WAS NOT DUE TO THE WIRE HARNESS, BUT THE BODY CONTROL MODULE (BCM) HAD FAILED.  IT WOULD COST ANOTHER $500 TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED AS IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  WE POLITELY TOLD THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT WE'D TAKE THE VEHICLE ELSEWHERE FOR REPAIRS (WE'VE GOTTEN THE QUOTES, BUT NOT HAD REPAIRS DONE AT THIS TIME).  IT JUST SEEMS STRANGE TO US THAT THE DEALERSHIP WAS FINALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AFTER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED!",

I HAD SIMILAR TROUBLE WITH AN OLDER MODEL, HOWEVER CHRYSLER HONORED THE REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. THIS TIME HOWEVER, THEY WERE NOT ONLY NASTY TO ME ON THE PHONE WHEN I CALLED, BUT THEIR RESPONSE WAS \"WE WILL NEVER PAY FOR OR REPAIR THIS VEHICLE\" WHICH I FIND ODD, CONSIDERING WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE FORCED TO RECALL IT FOR THIS PROBLEM. I'VE LOOKED INTO THIS, AND IT SEEMS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME TROUBLE WITH THESE VANS. NOW, I ASK CHRYSLER \"FOR OVER 13 YEARS YOU'VE CONTINUED TO MANUFACTURE DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSIONS, HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE TO BILK THE CUSTOMERS WHO HELPED MAKE YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST AUTOMAKERS IN THE WORLD\" YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR BACK ON THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO YOUR PRODUCT, DON'T BE SHOCKED WHEN WE RETURN THE FAVOR. WHEN THE FOREIGN AUTOMAKERS EVENTUALLY PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS, IT WILL BE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF CORRECTING YOUR BIGGEST AND LONGEST LASTING MISTAKE IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR VEHICLES. I SUGGEST YOU CHARGE A LITTLE MORE FOR YOUR CARS, AND INVEST IN THE TRANSMISSION LONGEVITY. SAVING A FEW PENNIES PER VEHICLE TODAY, WILL COST YOU BILLIONS SOME DAY. I WAS HOPEFULL THAT DAIMLER WOULD COME IN AND STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT, BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. SHAME ON YOU DAIMLER FOR EMBARRASSING YOURSELVES WITH POOR QUALITY, AND FOR THE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ALLLOW TO CONTINUE.

SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCE OF BEING STRANDED ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY WITH OUR 3 CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE TENSIONER BELT FALLING OFF, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE. IT COINCIDED WITH RAINY WEATHER BOTH TIMES. I HAVE READ SEVERAL OTHER REPORTS ON THE INTERNET WITH OTHER CONSUMERS HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM WITH THEIR DODGE GRAND CARAVANS. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THIS COULD LEAD TO DEATHS VERY EASILY. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET ACROSS 3 LANES OF TRAFFIC, WITH NO STEERING OR POWER, AND PARK IN THE BREAK DOWN LANE WHILE TRAFFIC PASSED BY US AT 75 MILES AN HOUR. WE WERE NEARLY REARENDED A COUPLE TIMES, WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT OUR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT FIRST, AND I DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT KIND OF IMPACT. IN THE MEANTIME, MY HUSBAND LITERALLY STOOD IN BACK OF OUR VAN WAVING OUR DETACHED SERPENTINE BELT IN THE AIR DESPERATE FOR SOMEONE TO HELP GET US OFF OF THE BUSY AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY HIGHWAY. THE NEXT 30 MINUTES WERE SCARY, I CRIED THE ENTIRE TIME SCARED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY 3 YOUNG CHILDREN (A NEWBORN, A 2 YEAR OLD AND A 3 YEAR OLD).   THE NEXT TIME THE BELT FELL OFF, LUCKILY I WAS NEARER TO OUR HOME ON A QUIET STREET. I COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD I LOST THE BELT WHILE ON A BACK COUNTRY ROAD IN MAINE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER, WITH MY 3 CHILDREN BY MYSELF. A FAMILY VAN SHOULD NEVER LOSE IT'S SERPENTINE BELT 3 TIMES IN 4 YEARS. WITH ALL THE RECORDED STATEMENTS FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM, SEVERAL TIMES OVER, THERE IS AMPLE PROOF THAT DODGE IS AWARE THAT THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM.  LOSING POWER, STEERING, ETC. IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. WE WERE LUCKY TO SURVIVE OUR INCIDENT. THERE WILL COME A DAY, IF THIS SITUATION IS NOT RESOLVED, WHERE A PERSON OR WHOLE FAMILY, WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS CARELESS DEFECT. *AK",

SOON THEREAFTER, I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL GARAGE AND EXPLAINED THE NOISE AND THAT I NOTICED THE HEAD WAS RUNNING DRY WITHOUT THE TYPE OF OIL SPLASH I HAVE SEEN IN ALL OTHER CARS I HAVE OWNED.  HE SAID THAT IT SEEMS THAT CHYSLER MINI-VANS HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE VALVES AND THAT IT WAS, IN HIS OPINION, AN OIL DELIVERY PROBLEM.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD 2 IN DURING THE PRIOR FEW WEEKS FOR THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM.  HE SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE DEALER AS THIS WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, ONE THAT SHOULDN'T EXIST IN A  CAR WITH 35K MILES.  WHEN I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER, TO MY SHOCK, I WAS TOLD THAT  THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO MAJOR REPAIRS DUE TO \"CAMSHAFT FAILURE\".  ALTHOUGH I ASKED FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE MANY TIMES, BOTH IN WRITING AND ON THE PHONE, \"CAMSHAFT FAILURE\" IS ALL THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  FORTUNATELY FOR ME, THEY AGREED TO PROVIDE A  FULL \"LONG BLOCK\" ENGINE REPLACEMENT (UNDER \"COURTESY\" WARRANTY WITH $300 \"DEDUCTIBLE.\")  BECAUSE OF WHAT  MY NON-DEALER MECHANIC SAID (THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN CHRYSLER MINI-VANS OF MY CAR'S VINTAGE AND BECAUSE HE OPINED THAT THERE MAY BE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH OIL DELIVERY, PLUS THE FACT THAT WHEN I CHECKED THIS SITE, I FOUND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAD REPORTED LIKE SOUNDING PROBLEMS,   I FEEL I SHOULD REPORT THIS.
