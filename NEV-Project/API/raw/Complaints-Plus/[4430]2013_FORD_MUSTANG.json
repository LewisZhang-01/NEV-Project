I HAVE LOOKED AT SEVERAL FORD BOSS302 FACEBOOK GROUPS AND EVERYONE STATES THEY WILL HAVE CLUTCH LOCKOUT IF THEY SHIFT AT HIGH RPM'S AND ULTIMATELY WILL HAVE TRANSMISSION FAILURE DUE TO A CLUTCH THAT IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH CLAMPING POWER TO  HOLD THE FLYWHEEL WHEN SHIFTING.  NUMEROUS USERS STATED THAT AS SOON AS THEY UPGRADED TO CLUTCHES BY MCCLEOD, EXEDY, OR MANTIC, THE PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY WENT AWAY.  THEY ALL STATE IT IS NOT THE TRANSMISSION, BUT THE FAULTY CLUTCH THAT CAUSES THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL EVENTUALLY.  THE BOSS 302 ENGINE HAS A 7,500 RPM REDLINE WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE OTHER COYOTE 5.0 LITER ENGINES.  THE CLUTCH CAN NOT HANDLE THIS HIGH RPM LIMIT.  SO, BASICALLY FORD SOLD A PERFORMANCE CAR THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE ANYWHERE NEAR ITS LIMITS BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY CLUTCH/TRANSMISSION.

APPARENTLY WHEN BEING PAINTED THE ALUMINUM HOOD WAS CONTAMINATED WITH STEEL PARTICLES WHICH FORD KNEW AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE WOULD CAUSE CORROSION AND PAINT PEELING BUT DID NOTHING TO TRY TO CORRECT THE METAL CONTAMINATION WHEN VEHICLES WERE PAINTED SO NOW AT 24,800 MILES THE HOOD IS CORRODING AND PAINT IS BUBBLING AND PEELING. I PAID ALOT OF MONEY FOR THIS CAR MUSTANG V6 PONY PACKAGE AND TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH HOOD CORROSION AND PEELING PAINT ON THIS CAR IS RIDICULOUS AND SHAMEFUL THAT FORD WILL NOT COVER THIS DAMAGE. I HAVE BOUGHT FORD VEHICLES MY WHOLE LIFE BUT I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A FORD VEHICLE AGAIN.",

THE CUT OFF BUILD DATE FOR THE RECALL WAS FEBRUARY 2012 AND MY VEHICLE WAS MADE IN AUGUST OF 2012. I ALSO READ OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME YEAR AND TRANSMISSION THAT I HAVE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AS ME. I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF I THEY WOULD EXTEND THE RECALL TO COVER 2013 MUSTANGS THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT.

THE CRACKS APPEAR IN THE SIDEWALLS/TREAD AND CAN CAUSE THE TIRE TO SEPARATE WHILE DRIVING, CAUSING A CRASH AND SERIOUS INJURY AND/OR DEATH.  I CALLED FORD TODAY WHEN I NOTICED THAT AT LEAST ONE OF MY REAR TIRES HAD DEVELOPED A CRACK (ITS IN THE 40S OUTSIDE TODAY; WAS HIGH 30S OVERNIGHT - THOUGH MY CAR IS STORED INSIDE IN A 2 CAR GARAGE, AND THEREFORE WARMER).  FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVISED THEY WERE POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING AND I NEEDED TO CONTACT GOODYEAR DIRECTLY.  GOODYEAR IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE (THEY ISSUED THE PSB AFTER ALL), AND ARE WILLING TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE TIRES (ON A PRORATED BASIS) - BUT THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THE TIRE!.  FORD HAS WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE ISSUE COMPLETELY AND REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE - STATING THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF GOODYEAR'S PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE PSB (HEARD FROM BOTH FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LOCAL FORD DEALER).  MANY, MANY OWNERS OF THESE CARS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE CRACKS AND REPLACED TIRES AT THEIR OWN COST (USUALLY SWITCHING TO ANOTHER BRAND).  FORD NEEDS TO STOP SELLING CARS WITH THESE TIRES AND GOODYEAR NEED TO STOP PUTTING LIFE-THREATENING PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.  I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST 1 INCIDENT OF A TIRE BLOWING MID-DRIVE RESULTING IN A 13/14 GT500 BEING TOTALED, AND AM HAPPY TO POINT THE NHTSA TO COUNTLESS THREADS ON ENTHUSIAST FORUM DETAILING THE ISSUE WITH PICTURES.
