THIS COMPLAINT IS RELATED TO SUNROOF SEAL LEAKS IN ANY MODE OF OPERATION.  THE SUNROOF SEAL IS A SINGLE STRIP OF RUBBER WITH A DISCONNECTED SEAM THAT IS ORIENTED AT THE TOP OF THE SUNROOF. AS THE RUBBER AGES, THE RUBBER SHRINKS AND THE SEAM CAN DEVELOP INTO A GAP THAT LETS WATER INSIDE THE SUNROOF DRAINAGE TRAY.  IF THE SUNROOF SEAL LEAKS OR FAILS, THE CAR IS DESIGNED TO COLLECT THE WATER AND DRAIN IT TO A LOCATION NEAR THE FRONT WHEEL WELLS.  THIS WORKS PERFECTLY AS LONG AS THE CAR IS LEVEL.  IF THE CAR IS PARKED AT A 15% GRADE OR STEEPER WITH THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE POINTING UPWARDS, THE SUNROOF SEAL WILL LEAK, BUT THE WATER COLLECTED WILL NOT DRAIN TOWARD THE INTENDED DRAINS.  THE WATER WILL INSTEAD FLOW DOWN THE SIDES OF THE ROOFLINE INSIDE PLASTIC TROUGHS.  THESE TROUGHS ARE NOT WELL DRAINED TO THE EXTERIOR.  THE WATER WILL FLOW THROUGH THE TROUGHS AND EXIT INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE NEAR THE HEAD LINER AND THE REAR PLASTIC TRIM OF THE INTERIOR NEXT TO THE REAR WINDOW.   THIS WILL EVENTUALLY FILL UP THE SEALED SPARE TIRE WELL, AND WILL CAUSE CORROSION OVER TIME.  THIS CORROSION MAY AFFECT THE CAR'S STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND MAY AFFECT THE CAR'S CRASH WORTHINESS IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.  THE WATER IS ONLY NOTICEABLE IF THE TRUNK SHELF IS REMOVED, WHICH IN MANY VEHICLES WILL NEVER HAPPEN.  THE WATER ALSO HAS A TENDENCY TO COLLECT ON THE REAR SEATBELT SPOOL AND THE SPOOL SUPPORT FASTENERS.  IF THE WATER IS LEFT ON THE SEATBELT SPOOLS FOR LONG ENOUGH TIME, THE SEATBELTS FOR THE REAR SEATS CAN BE WEAKENED OVER TIME BY CORROSION.  THE SEATBELT ISSUE MAY NOT BECOME A SAFETY CONCERN UNTIL SOMETIME IN THE CAR'S FUTURE IN THE SECONDHAND MARKET. BLACK MOLD GROWTH MAY BECOME AN ISSUE AS WELL.",

THE CAR OCCASIONALLY WOULD JUMP OR ACCELERATE WHILE I WAS STOPPED AT A LIGHT OR STOP SIGN.  I WOULD HAVE TO SLAM ON THE BRAKE TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATE LIKE THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS RESETTING TO A HIGHER SPEED, AGAIN HAD TO USE THE BRAKES.  OTHER TIMES IT WOULD SLOW DOWN LIKE IT WAS GOING TO STOP AND THEN SUDDENLY GO. IT IS AT A POINT NOW WHERE IT SOMETIMES WILL NOT SHIFT AND I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE I AM IN LOW GEAR FOR A MINUTE OR TWO EVEN THOUGH I AM  GOING 60 MPH.  I GOT IN IT THIS WEEK AND THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO DRIVE.  I PUT IT IN REVERSE AND IT MOVED, PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE AND NOTHING, PUT IT IN REVERSE AGAIN AND FINALLY IT WENT INTO DRIVE.  NOW IT HESITATES SOMETIMES WHEN I AM AT A STOP SIGN AND GETTING READY TO RESUME DRIVING, I HAVE HAD HORNS HONKED AT ME AND GESTURES MADE BECAUSE IT TAKES THE CAR SOMETIMES 2 MINUTES TO GO INTO GEAR.  I HAVE CALLED FORD ON A FEW OCCASIONS TO TRY AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A MECHANIC BUT ONCE I TELL THEM WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I AM TOLD THAT IT IS NORMAL AND TO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.  I AM NOW UPSIDE DOWN IN A CAR FINANCIALLY THAT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE SO AM EITHER LOOKING AT HAVING A CAR REPOSSESSED IN ORDER TO GET ANOTHER ONE OR JUST LETTING IT SET AND PURCHASING A GOOD USED CAR UNTIL I CAN AFFORD TO FIX THIS ONE.
