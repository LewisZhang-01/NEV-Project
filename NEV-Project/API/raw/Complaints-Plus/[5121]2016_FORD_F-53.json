The contact stated that the dealer had repaired the seat belt bolts upon purchasing the RV; however, while her husband was driving approximately 55-65 MPH in the mountains with her in the front passenger\u2019s side seat, the front driver's side seat belt detached from the wall while it was buckled. The contact's husband pulled to the side of the road. Upon inspecting the front passenger's side seat belt, the contact's husband noticed that it was also loosened. The RV was taken to the dealer and was being repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that the dealer should contact them to obtain the schematic of the wall where the seat belts were supposed to be bolted.
