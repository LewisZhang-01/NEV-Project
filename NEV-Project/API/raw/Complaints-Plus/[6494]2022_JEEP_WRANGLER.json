        "summary": "On 03/03/2022 I purchase a new 2door jeep wrangler s 2022 at the Victoria dealership in Texas. During the test drive, while driving on the highway at 70 mph, I expressed my concern about the steering wheel acting out and feeling loose. It was a very short drive. The dealership personnel reassured me that everything was fine with the car and I would be safe while driving it. I was ready to drive back home to Corpus Christi. Unfortunately, the 140 mi ride turned into a nightmare. After speeding to 60 mph on the highway, the car started acting weird. The wheel felt loose, the steering not under control. The next curve on the road, and I completely lost control over the car; the car just went into the right lane, and I was lucky the truck behind managed to stop. And then it happened again when I was slowing down.  I had to stop to calm down. I was shaking and was scared to keep driving home. It took me over 3 hours to get home\u2014the most extended 3 hours ever. I kept the speed 50 mph and below the whole time, and my sister was driving behind me.  On 03/05/2022 the vehicle was at the dealership in Corpus Christi to be checked and the problem fixed. They test drove it, find a wobble when hitting a bump, changed a part.  The main problem of the loose steering wheel hasn't been fixed. At higher speeds the wheel goes left and right, and the car does not follow; I don't have control of the vehicle and it goes into the right lane on its own. Very unsafe!",
