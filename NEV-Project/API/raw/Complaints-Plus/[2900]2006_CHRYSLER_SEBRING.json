A TECHNICIAN AT ONE OF THE FIAT-CHRYSLER REPAIR CENTERS DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AND STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE DUE TO A BAD SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG AND HORN, AND THAT WOULD COST OVER $1,000 TO REPAIR. THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPAIR IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T RECALL ISSUE. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I AM ON PERMANENT DISABILITY AND ON A VERY LOW INCOME, I AM UNABLE TO AFFORD TO REPAIR IT.  AFTER REALIZING THAT THERE IS NO LIGHT IN SIGHT, I BEGAN TO RESEARCH AS TO HOW MANY OTHER CONSUMERS/OR CHRYSLER SEBRING OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AS I AM PRESENTLY EXPERIENCING. I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 52 COMPLAINTS FROM SEBRING CAR OWNERS LISTED IN THE FOLLOWING SITE: HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CHRYSLER/SEBRING/2006/ACCESSORIES-INTERIOR/HORN_GOES_OFF_BY_ITSELF.

IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHENEVER THERE IS A TEMPERATURE DROP OUTSIDE. BUT NOW IT WILL GOING OFF SOMETIMES WHEN I START THE CAR AND SOMETIME WHILE I AM DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. I HAVE TO HIT THE HORN TO STOP IT WHILE DRIVING TO GET IT TO STOP. OTHER DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS SEEM TO PANIC WHEN IT GOES OFF BECAUSE IT IS SCARES THE HELL OF YOU WHEN IT GOES OFF AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY DANGER IN THE AREA. MY NEIGHBORS ARE GETTING A LITTLE ANNOYED WITH HORN GOING OFF AT NIGHT. IT EVEN WHEN OFF AT WORK WHILE PARKED IN THE PARKING LOT DURING THE DAY. CHRYSLER NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED ON THIS MATTER SHOWS THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MANY SEBRING OWNERS. MANY OF THEM DO NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THEY CAN REPORT THIS AND MOST LIKELY ARE FOOTING THE $1000 PRICE TAG FOR THE DEFECT.  *TR",

SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES SOMETIMES WHEN DRIVING AND SOMETIMES WHEN PARKED.

THIS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN THE HORN IS NEEDED & DOES NOT BLOW & IS ALSO A PROBLEM WHEN IT BLOWS WHEN IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.  I CAN IMAGINE HOW I WOULD FEEL IF WHILE SITTING IN STOPPED TRAFFIC THE CAR BEHIND ME WOULD LAY ON THEIR HORN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD IF YOU REMOVE THE AIR BAG RELAY OR UNPLUG THE HORN WIRE THE HORN WILL STOP BLOWING.  THIS OF COURSE WOULD LEAVE YOU WITHOUT A HORN, WHICH IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION.  I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD BUT HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT BY UNPLUGGING THE HORN RELAY, IT MAKES THE DRIVERS AIRBAG INOPERATIVE (DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE).  THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE IN THE HORN SWITCH LOCATED ON TOP OF THE AIR BAG.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A CHRYSLER DEALER THAT THE ENTIRE AIR BAG NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  IF THE HORN DOES NOT BLOW WHEN PUSHED OR BLOWS WHEN IT IS NOT PUSHED IT IS A REAL SAFETY CONCERN NOT TO MENTION IF YOU WERE IN A SERIOUS CRASH & THE HORN RELAY WAS REMOVED CAUSING THE AIR BAG NOT TO DEPLOY.  *TR",

REMOVING THE FUSE HAS CAUSED THE AIR BAG FUNCTIONS TO BE UNKNOWN.   REMOVING THE FUSE TO STOP THE HORN ALSO AFFECTS PART OF THE FUELING SYSTEM ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL (SAME FUSE).  REMOVING THE FUSE HAS CAUSED US NOT TO BE ABLE TO USE OUR HORN INCASE SOMETHING RAN IN FRONT OF THE CAR OR TO ALARM OTHERS OF HARM. THE HORN IS A FUNCTION OF SAFETY AND WARNING. THIS IS STANDARD ON ALL CARS AS A PRECAUTION AND WARNING SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT A PART OF THE CAR THAT IS SPECIAL ORDERED, THESE COME STANDARD WITH ALL CARS. SO WHY IS CHRYSLER NOT PAYING FOR THIS SAFETY ISSUE? YOUR COMPANY HAS BEEN RUN INTO THE GROUND WITH RECALLS AND SAFETY MEASURES NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

IT WILL NOT SHUT OFF, MUST KEEP HITTING & POUNDING ON STEERING PAD TO GET IT TO STOP.  FINALLY HAD TO DISCONNECT THE HORN.  I DIDN'T WANT TO GET STUCK SOMEWHERE WITH A DEAD BATTERY OR WORSE, GET IN AN ACCIDENT TRYING TO GET THAT HORN TO SHUT OFF.  SO NOW I'M DRIVING WITHOUT A HORN, ALSO NOT SAFE.  I CAN STILL HEAR A CLICKING SOUND IN THE STEERING PAD WHILE DRIVING, JUST LIKE I HEARD WHEN FIGHTING TO GET THE HORN TO STOP.  I HAVE CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IT THIS IS COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY BUT OF COURSE THEY WON'T TELL ME THAT WITHOUT RUNNING A $120 DIAGNOSTIC, I TOLD THEM I WILL NOT PAY FOR DIAGNOSTICS BECAUSE ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS CONTACT CHRYSLER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IT.  CHECK THE INTERNET, MINE IS NOT THE ONLY SEBRING WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT THE AIRBAG IS INTERTWINED WITH THE HORN PROBLEM AND SO FIXING THIS PROBLEM RUNS IN THE AREA OF $1,000.00. *TR",

I CALLED ABOUT THAT PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN. WHICH I WOULD HAVE, BUT OVER THAT WEEKEND OUT OF NOWHERE, MY CAR STALLED OUT ON ME WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARNING LIGHTS OR GAUGES. I CALLED A LOCAL TOWING COMPANY TO PICK IT UP, AND THEY IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD SEE RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT I HAD A LARGE HOLE IN MY OIL PAN, AND ALL OF THE OIL HAD PROBABLY LEAKED OUT. SO I TOLD THEM JUST TO GO AHEAD AND REPLACE IT AND WE WOULD GO FROM THERE, THINKING THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT. UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS WRONG. AFTER THEY REPLACED THE OIL PAN, THEY SOON REALIZED THAT MY ENGINE HAD SEIZED. SO ASSUMING THE DEALERSHIP WOULD BE THE ONES TO INSTALL THE NEW ENGINE, I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO MY HOUSE UNTIL I CONFIRMED THINGS WITH THE DEALERSHIP. I ALSO FIGURED THAT BECAUSE THE CAR WAS BARELY A YEAR OLD, IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY. I WAS WRONG AGAIN. SO, LONG STORY A LITTLE SHORTER, THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO PAY FOR ANY OF THE NEW ENGINE, NOR DID THEY EVEN GIVE ME A GOOD PRICE ON ONE. THEIR CHEAPEST ONE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE PRICE OF ANOTHER MECHANICS MOST EXPENSIVE. SO, BECAUSE I HAD THE ENGINE REPLACED SOMEWHERE ELSE, MY WARRANTY FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE WAS VOID. SINCE THEN, I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS OUT OF IT, AND ITS GOING TO BREAK DOWN FOR GOOD SOON BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP UP WITH THE PROBLEMS. MY ENGINE LIGHT IS CURRENTLY ON, AND HAS BEEN FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, I JUST RECENTLY HAD AN ANTIFREEZE LEAK FIXED, I THINK THERE MAY BE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, AND MY HORN STILL DOESN'T WORK.
