THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS LIKELY A PARTS RECALL ISSUE: RECALL: 07V375000: FUEL PUMP REPLACEMENT.    I CONTACTED VW AMERICA, INC. AND WAS INFORMED THAT WHILE IN FACT THERE WAS SUCH A RECALL FOR 2003 PASSATS, MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT COVERED IN THE RECALL AND THUS THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD/WOULD DO TO HELP ME DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE THE VERY ONE INDICATED IN THE RECALL NOTICE.

BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF TWO COILS AT RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE I DECIDED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT RELIABLE, AND TRADED IT IN FOR A HONDA ACCORD.

THEY REPORTED THAT A CAM BOLT SNAPPED IN THE ENGINE WHICH CAUSED THE OIL PRESSURE TO CEASE AND IN RETURN CAUSED THE ENGINE TO BLOW.  THEY TOLD ME  THAT A CAM BOLT SHOULD NEVER SNAP AND THIS WAS A PRODUCT FAILURE.  FLOW MOTORS RETRIEVED THE VEHICLE AND DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PRODUCT FAILURE AND RECOMMENDED I PUT A NEW ENGINE IN THE VEHICLE AT THE COST OF 6,500.  I REPLACED THE ENGINE AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER HAD TO REPLACE A COOLING FLANGE AT 300.00 AND AFTER THAT A VACUUM HOSE AT 300.00.  BEFORE REPLACING THE VACUUM HOSE THERE WAS A LEAK IN MY BACK FLOORBOARD AND HAD THE VEHICLE IN AT FLOW MOTORS ON TWO OCCASION BUT THEY COULD NOT LOCATE THE LEAK BUT STILL CHARGED ME 50.00 TO LOOK FOR THE LEAK.  I'VE HAD TO CUT THE CARPET OUT OF THE BACK FLOORBOARD BECAUSE OF MOLD.  VOLKSWAGEN BROKE MY HOOD SUPPORT BAR AND ALSO REFUSED TO COVER THE EXPENSES TO PAY FOR THAT.    WHEN THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE BLEW MY WIFE CALLED ME IMMEDIATELY TO TELL ME THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  I TOLD HER TO PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY AND SHE DID.  WHEN SHE CAME TO A STOP THE ENGINE CUT OFF AND WOULD NOT START BACK UP.  THE ENGINE HAD JUST OVER 91,000 AND CAN'T ACCEPT HAVING TO REPLACE THE ENGINE WHEN ALL THE MAINTENANCE WAS KEPT UP.  TERRY VOLKSWAGEN SAYS THE CAM BOLT SNAPPED AND STATED THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON A VEHICLE WITH ONLY 91,000.    I HAVE COMPLAINED TO VOLKSWAGEN, THE BBB, AND CURRENTLY AM SPEAKING WITH AN ATTORNEY. *TR",

I APPROVED NEW BATTERY PURCHASE, BUT DEALER WAS UNABLE TO  MAKE WARNING LIGHT GO OUT, DESPITE RECODING THE CONTROLLER .  DEALER CLAIMED FURTHER TESTING REVEALED AIRBAG UNIT CONTROLLER HAD FAILED AND WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENT AT PARTS COST OF $798.00.   I DECLINED TO PAY THAT AMOUNT.  IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION, SERVICE REP SAID HE WAS UNABLE  TO CONFIRM THAT AIRBAG(S) WOULD DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.  SINCE THEY I HAVE DRIVEN VEHICLE FOR ABOUT ONE MONTH, AND EACH TIME I START VEHICLE A WARNING SOUNDS, THE \"AIRBAG FAILURE\" NOTICE COMES UP ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE AIRBAG WARNING SIGNAL STAYS ON CONSTANTLY.  I TELEPHONED VW CUSTOMER SERVICE TO COMPLAIN AND WAS TOLD  THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM AND THAT SINCE VEHICLE WAS NEARLY 6 YEARS OLD AND OUT OF WARRANTY I WOULD NEED TO ASSUME COST OF REPAIR/UNIT REPLACEMENT.   I SAID I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SAFETY FAILURE WITH VEHICLE BECOMING OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THROUGH NO FAULT OR MALPRACTICE OF THE OWNER (MYSELF) AND THAT VW SHOULD ASSUME COST OF REPAIRS.  CUSTOMER SERVICE REP SAID THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT AND REPLY. SO FAR NO RESPONSE.   VEHICLE CONTINUES TO DISPLAY AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT. *TR",

I HAD TOLD THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE TIMING BELT, WATER PUMP, BELTS, SPARK PLUGS, BRAKES AND ROTORS AND THE 95,000 MAINTENANCE ON THE CAR. THIS COST ME WELL OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS, I SUPPLIED BRAKES AND ROTORS AND SPARK PLUGS. THE CAR RAN OKAY BUT I BEGAN TO SMELL OIL BURNING AND WHENEVER I UNLOCKED MY CAR TO GET IN IT WOULD LOCK AUTOMATIC AND THEN WHEN I STARTED IT THE ALARM WOULD GO OFF. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE OIL SMELL AND THEY HAD ME BRING IT BACK IN TO LOOK AT. AT THAT TIME THEY SAID THERE WAS A SMALL LEAK AND THEY WOULD CLEAN IT AND TIGHTEN THE BOLTS, THIS WAS ON FRIDAY JANUARY 26TH. ON MONDAY JANUARY 29TH I WAS TRAVELING AND WHEN I PULLED ON TO THE 4 LANE HIGHWAY AND ACCELERATED THE ENGINE LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH ON AND OFF, SO I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE CAR DIED. AFTER A FEW MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO RESTART IT BUT IT RAN VERY ROUGH. THE STATE HIGHWAY PATROL CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND IT WAS TOWED TO THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALER. THE NEXT DAY THEY INFORMED ME THAT AN IGNITION MODULE HAD GONE OUT AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME 30 SOME DOLLARS A PIECE TO REPLACE THEM AND THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACING THEM ALL. WHEN I ASK THEM ABOUT THE RECALL THEY TOLD ME THAT VOLKSWAGEN WAS INTO THE K'S ON THESE AND MY WAS BEFORE THAT. I HAD ASK THEM ABOUT THIS WHEN I RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER FROM VWOFA, AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD CHECK IT. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT.  *NM",

THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IN OCTOBER 2004, WHILE I WAS TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEED ON A RURAL INTERSTATE FOLLOWING A WEEKEND TRIP TO A NEIGHBORING STATE.  I HAD BEEN USING THE CRUISE CONTROL TO TRAVEL AT THE 65 MPH SPEED LIMIT, AND HAD ACCELERATED TO PASS A SEMI-TRACTOR-TRAILER.  HAVING PASSED THE TRUCK, THE CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT KICK BACK IN AS USUAL WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR BUT, RATHER, THE CAR LOST POWER SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY.  I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE TO THE SIDE SHOULDER WITHOUT PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURY, WHERE I ARRANGED FOR TOWING TO THE NEAREST TOWN WITH A VW DEALER (THE TOW-TRUCK DRIVER SENT TO RETRIEVE ME NEARLY WAS SIDE-SWIPED/KILLED BY A PASSING SEMI WHILE LOADING MY VEHICLE ONTO HIS FLATBED, HOWEVER).  IT BEING A SUNDAY, MY TRIP WAS DISRUPTED AND I WAS FORCED TO STAY OVERNIGHT IN THE DEALER LOCALE UNTIL THE PROBLEM COULD BE ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING DAY.  BECAUSE A NEW FUEL PUMP WAS NOT IN STOCK AND COULD NOT BE DELIVERED FOR ANOTHER 2 DAYS, I RETURNED HOME IN A RENTAL CAR AND ARRANGED TO HAVE MY CAR TRANSPORTED TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP ONCE THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE SOME 9 DAYS LATER.  EXPENSES OF THE DISRUPTION WERE REIMBURSED COMPLETELY BY VW OF AMERICA. I BECAME AWARE OF THE SUBSEQUENT RECALL ONLY RECENTLY VIA AN INTERNET WEBSITE ON VW PASSAT MECHANICAL PROBLEMS.

I'VE REPORTED THE WARNING LIGHT A COUPLE OF TIMES AS WELL TO THE VW SERVICE AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENS EITHER.

SHE ADVISED THAT VW ROADSIDE CAN COME TOW MY VEHICLE TO A DEALERSHIP (THAT WON'T REOPEN UNTIL MONDAY) OR THEY CAN COME TO JUMP-START MY CAR (WHICH CAN TAKE UP TO 45-60 MIN. AFTER DISPATCH).

BRAKE LIGHTS REMAINING ON WHILE DRIVING AND AFTER THE CAR IS SHUT OFF.

WHEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN AT MY REGULAR CHECK UP IN JUNE OF 2005, AFTER ONLY 7 MONTHS AND 11,427 MILES FROM THE LAST TIME I CHANGED THE BRAKES AND ROTORS, I RAISED SOME RED FLAGS AND SUGGESTED THAT I LEMON LAW THE CAR, VW RESEARCHED AND FOUND THAT \"THERE WAS EXCESSIVE HEAT ON MY REAR BRAKES AND THAT MY BOOSTER ROD WAS BENT AND NOT RELEASING REAR BRAKE PRESSURE COMPLETELY\".  ON JULY 11, 2005 VW REPLACED THE BRAKE BOOSTER, MASTER CYLINDER, ROTORS, AND BRAKES.

THOUGH IT HAS ONLY BEEN AT INCONVENIENCE AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE IT RESOLVED ASAP.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BRAKE PADS, VW HAVE NOT CHARGED ME FOR THE ROTORS AND THOUGH THEY HAVE SAID THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR ROTORS AND BRAKES AND THEY HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THE CHANGES EVEN THOUGH IT IS AFTER MY WARRANTY SO THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS LIKE MINE AND THERE HAS TO BE A PROBLEM.  *NM",

HOWEVER, AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF, IT ALWAYS SOUNDED AS THOUGH A FAN MOTOR WOULD CONTINUOUSLY RUN FOR WELL OVER 15 MINUTES AFTER THE CAR WAS TURNED OFF. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR APPROX. 6 MONTHS. ON THE DATE OF INCIDENT, I HAD DRIVEN HOME FROM WORK, PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY, AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE. THANKFULLY, THE LAWN WAS LONG, SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT TO CUT THE LAWN AFTER CHANGING MY CLOTHES.  JUST IN THAT TIME, MAYBE 5-10 MINUTES THE MOST, I CAME OUT AND NOTICED THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I POPPED THE HOOD AND LOOKED INTO THE ENGINE BAY TO SEE FLAMES ON THE LOWER BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE. IT WAS ON THE LEFT SIDE IF YOU WERE LOOKING INTO THE ENGINE BAY AND TOWARD THE FRONT. IT SMELLED OF BURNING PLASTIC AND METAL.  THERE WAS ACTUALLY FLAMES, WHICH I PULLED OUT MYSELF WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND A LAWN HOSE. I DID GET A POLICE REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND CONTINUED TO SEARCH ONLINE FOR OTHER ISSUES OF THE SAME SORT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM, AND IN SOME EVENTS, THEY EVEN MENTION THE ONGOING FAN SOUND.  I FEEL THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO BE LOOKED INTO. I WAS LUCKY, THANKS TO A LONG LAWN, BUT I COULD HAVE LOST MY CAR, AND MY HOME, BECAUSE THE CAR WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE BY LESS THEN TWO FEET.   ANY CONSIDERATION TAKEN IN THIS MATTER IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. IT IS UNCLEAR AS TO HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE RESOLVED, WHETHER WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY, OR WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE FINANCIAL LOSS, BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A LIEN ON THE AUTOMOBILE.

AFTER GETTING IT STARTED AND BEING UNAWARE OF THE SITUATION WE WERE DEALING WITH, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG.  DURING THAT RIDE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WENT HAYWIRE, THE CAR BEGAN TO LURCH AND ULTIMATELY SHUT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  I WAS FORCED TO CALL VW FOR A TOW AND WAS RESPONDED TO PROMPTLY.  THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPT EXAMINED THE CAR AND FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE AND THE AIR BAG CONTROL MODULE WERE BOTH SUBMERGED AS THEY BOTH REST UNDERNEATH THE CARPET IN THE FLOORBOARD. BOTH ITEMS WERE DEEMED TO BE NONFUNCTIONING AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  ALONG WITH THE LABOR TO CLEAN CARPETS AND REPLACE THESE PARTS THE TOTAL BILL WAS AROUND 2300 DOLLARS.  HERE IS MY COMPLAINT:  THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, HOWEVER; THERE IS NO LITERATURE IN THE OWNERS MANUAL OR BUYERS GUIDE THAT SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THESE DRAINS UNCLOGGED.  I MEAN IF MAJOR FLOODING IN THE FLOORBOARD OF A VEHICLE, A PLACE WHERE THE VITAL COMPUTER MODULES ARE KEPT, IS GOING TO CREATE CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE THEN IT SHOULD BE NOTATED AND/OR MADE CLEAR TO THE BUYER AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW AND WORTHY OF WARRANTING A RECALL.  IF YOU NEED VERIFICATION OF MANY MORE INSTANCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME TYPES OF VEHICLES (VW PASSATS, ETC.)

THE DEALER REPLACED THE PLUG FREE OF CHARGE.  HERE IS WHAT IS COMMON TO BOTH SITUATIONS: BOTH DRAIN PLUGS WERE TIGHTENED TO AT LEAST THE FACTORY SPECIFICATION (I CHANGED THE OIL AND ALWAYS USED A TORQUE WRENCH ON THE JETTA) AND BOTH HAD DRAIN PLUGS PULL AWAY FROM THE PAN.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS BUT I HAVE A HYPOTHESIS ON TWO IMPORTANT VARIABLES:  (1) BOTH PANS ARE MADE OF ALUMINUM, WHICH CHANGES SHAPE EASILY WITH TEMPERATURE CHANGE, (2) THE DRAIN PLUG IS MANUFACTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE WASHER (SEAL RING) CANNOT BE REMOVED AND REPLACED.  IF THE SEAL WERE WARPED OR DAMAGED IN SOME WAY (PERHAPS OVERTORQUING OR DROPPING THE PLUG) IT MIGHT NOT SEAL PROPERLY.

I AM WRITING TO REPORT A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PASSENGER SAFETY ISSUE REGARDING THE ELECTRIC FRONT SEATS IN THE 2003 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT GLX ON A RAINY AFTERNOON, MY SIX YEAR OLD SON AND I GOT INTO THE CAR IN A PARKING LOT.  I PUT HIM INTO THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR AND HE SECURED HIMSELF WITH THE SEAT BELT. I WENT AROUND TO THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND ENTERED, PUTTING THE UMBRELLA INTO THE FOOT WELL OF THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, WITH THE HANDLE RESTING ON THE FRONT SEAT EDGE.  AS I STARTED THE CAR, WITHOUT MY NOTICING, THE UMBRELLA HANDLE FELL BETWEEN THE SEAT AND INSIDE DOOR, ACTIVATING THE LEVER TO RECLINE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BACK.  MY SON YELLED SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEAT AND I TURNED TO SEE THE SEAT BACK LOWERING TOWARD HIS LEGS.  HE COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE OF THE SEAT BELT.  WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED, I COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY FIND A WAY TO STOP THE SEAT FROM RECLINING FURTHER.  I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND PULLED THE KEY OUT, BUT THE SEAT CONTINUED DOWNWARD ONTO HIS LEGS.  AT THE LAST SECOND I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND PULLED THE UMBRELLA HANDLE OFF THE SEAT LEVER AS THE SEAT BACK LOWERED ONTO MY SONS KNEES, PINNING HIM INTO THE REAR SEAT.  AFTER I RAISED THE SEAT, MY SON COMPLAINED OF PAIN IN BOTH OF HIS KNEES.    IN CHECKING OUT THE SEAT LATER, I FOUND THAT THE FRONT SEAT BACK HAS NO STOP, RATCHET OR RELEASE TO PREVENT IT FROM LOWERING FORCIBLY INTO THE REAR SEAT CUSHION.  THE SEAT CONTINUES DOWNWARD INTO THE CUSHION UNTIL THE MOTOR STRAINS TO A STOP.  * NLM",
