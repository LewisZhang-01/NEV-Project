I wasn't aware there was only a 2 year warranty on the work done, and that would have put it in 202 when everything was pretty much closed down. I contacted Dodge and they said there was nothing they could do about it.  I know another recall was  R61 / NHTSA 15V-675 ABS Ground Wiring issue which got \"fixed.\" Now, I am having an ABS, Skid Control, Brake light issue. I took my car to the shop and they are charging me $180 just to find out the issue. I received a call from the mechanic and he proceeded to tell me the parts needed are on backorder and may be available in March 2022, which will cost close to $2k to repair. I was also advised by the mechanic this is a common issue across Dodge, Crystler Jeep. If that is the case, which it seems to be since I have been looking online and there have been a lot of complaints, why is this not a recall? Why, if dodge messed up when producing vehicles between certain years, do the consumers have to pay to get this fixed? I don't think it is right and I think if Dodge isn't going to take responsibility and issue a recall on this then there needs to be a Class Action Suit against Dodge. I intend to start doing some legal research to find out what the process is to do this. I can't believe a dealership can charge someone $180 to run a diagnostics on the vehicle when they know what the issue is, since it is common, plus being able to charge almost $2k to repair. The issue is with the ABS pump and module, and this has to be done at the dealership since it is electrical and needs to be hooked up to the computer to calibrate or what ever.",

I called the dealership and they told me they would try to get me in at the next availability. With the end of my warranty closely approaching I told them this wasn\u2019t an option. They finally got my car in after I made a few demanding phone calls to the right people and come to find out that somehow some hardware in my engine came loose and it was causing very abnormal wear on my lifters and so they \u201cfixed\u201d the problem. Fast forward a few months and now I\u2019ve been having an annoying ticking noise coming from my engine. I tried using Seafoam, nada. I tried using Lucas High Mileage additive, no dice. So I took it to a trusted mechanic as it is now well outside my warranty and he told me \u201cit\u2019s your lifters\u201d which I already had a feeling it would be just by listening to the sound as between and idle and acceleration. So being I have over 167k miles on it it\u2019s not even worth fixing. Oh and just a side note, my mechanic also mentioned to me that he fixed 4 other Journeys that week which tells me that Dodge has a serious problem with these model cars that they will not address. Oh and just for the record, I have the garbage 3.6L Pentastar engine",
