        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A 2014 BRAND NEW HEARTLAND BIG COUNTRY FIFTH WHEEL IN NOVEMBER 2014. WE TOOK IT ON OUR FIRST LONG TRIP BEGINNING JUNE 2015.  WITH LESS THAN 3500 MILES ON THE POWER KING TRAILER TIRES WE HAD A BLOW OUT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT TIRE TRAVELING AT LESS THAN 60 MILES AN HOUR.  THE TIRE SHREDDED AND IN THE PROCESS RIPPED THE BUMPER FROM THE CAMPER, ALONG WITH TV LINES RESULTING IN OVER $4000.00 IN DAMAGE.  WE HAD THE TIRE REPLACED AT A TIRE STORE AND CONTINUED OUR TRIP.  APPROXIMATELY 3000 MILES LATER THE 2ND TIRE BLEW (ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE FIRST BUT THE REAR TIRE BLEW THIS TIME)  ONCE AGAIN WE HAD THE TIRE REPLACED, AND FOCUSSED ON GETTING HOME AT THAT POINT.  THE TRAILER WAS REPAIRED UPON OUR RETURN AND WE ALSO PURCHASED A TIRE MONITOR.  LAST WEEK WE LOADED THE CAMPER AND HEADED OUT FOR A WEEK IN THE CAROLINAS.  WITHIN 75 MILES THE FRONT TRAILER PASSENGER TIRE BLEW.  THIS TIME THE BRAKE LINES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAMPER WERE RIPPED OFF FROM PIECES OF THE SHREDDED TIRE. FORTUNATELY A STATE FARM ROAD RANGER ASSISTED US, CHANGED THE TIRE, AND TOLD US THE OTHER TIRE LOOKED UNUSUALLY SHAPED AND RECOMMENDED WE EXIT ASAP TO CHECK IT.  A FLORIDA STATE TROOPER OBSERVED THE SAME PROBLEM.  WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A TIRE STORE, SELLING THE SAME POWER KING TIRES.  THEY HAD NO OTHER, SO WE PUT TWO MORE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, TURNED AROUND, DROVE THE CAMPER BACK TO CAMPING WORLD AND HAVE JUST SPENT $2000.00 PUTTING NEW GOODYEAR TIRES ON THE ENTIRE CAMPER.  WE WERE TOLD WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL NO ONE WAS HURT, AS THE POWER KING TOW MASTER TIRES PUT ON THESE NEW RIGS ARE NOT SAFE, AND SHOULD BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE WERE NOT INFORMED AT ALL REGARDING THIS BY HEARTLAND OR CAMPING WORLD.  HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE THERE ARE MORE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES.  IT'S SHAMEFUL \"MADE IN AMERICA\" RV DEALERS ARE GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.",
