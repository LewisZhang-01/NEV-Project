Two error messages immediately appeared on the dashboard: \"Service Advancetrac\" and \"Power Steering Fault\". I managed to pull the car over safely, however this was an extremely dangerous situation that could have led to an accident.  The car was brought to Watertown Ford, 26 Seyon Street, Waltham MA, 02453. The Ford technician confirmed that multiple diagnostic codes were present (related to the steering rack and PCSM - power steering control module), and indicated that the power steering rack needed to be replaced at a cost of $2,700.  Upon further research, I noticed that Ford opened a recall program for 2013 Ford Taurus models pertaining to this exact issue. I called Ford, but was informed that my VIN number was not included in the recall, and did not receive an explanation why. Ford's number for this recall is 15S18. NHTSA Campiagn Number is 15V605000.  I'm shocked that this was not covered under Ford's recall program, and that I was forced to pay $2,700 in order to have a completely new power steering rack installed. I'm quite fearful that this will occur again in the future. I have attached the invoice from Watertown Ford for reference.",

After rotating the steering wheel a couple of times the power steering came back but now there is a clicking sound while rotating the steering on both sides.   I researched online for recalls and found Recall No. 15S18 for this issue. I am the 2nd owner of this vehicle since 2016 and I had the vehicle checked for the recall when I had purchased it. At that time no error code was found. Since my vehicle was checked once the recall does not show up for my Vin number but now I have the actual issue.  I contacted Ford on Facebook (since their chat does not work) and they told me to contact the dealer.  I contacted the Ford Dealer (Frontier Ford) and the customer service told me someone will contact me . I waited one day and checked back with them and they told me that they need to check if they have the part for the Recall. It has been another day but no one contacted me.  I contacted another dealer (Sunnyvale Ford) and their customer service looked up my Vin number and told me that no un repaired recalls for my vehicle. The recall does not show up because it was there when I bought the car in 2016 and I had them check it but at that time there was nothing found. If you google online or check on YouTube there are a lot of people having this issue. One Video on YouTube made by an engineer shows the problem existed since 2011 and that it is due to heating and that Ford was always aware of the issue.   Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szHMXwcp9fo&authuser=0  I hope someone can step in and have Ford fix this Recall issue",

The steering locks up an the wheel becomes very still and hard to turn. This issue has been determined by a local dealership. There have been no warning lamps to signal the issue which makes it more dangerous due to no warning prior to when the issue started. After doing some research, I have found that similar vehicles to mine have a recall. The same vehicles (2013 taurus) manufactured in Chicago between September 7, 2010- February 28, 2012 have the same failed components as mine except they are recalled and mine is not.",

We took it to the local Ford dealer back then  and since the light comes on randomly, they could not get a report to show. I told them that there was a loss of power steering assist recall in June of 2015, but since my VIN was not one of the recalls they refused to do recall work. The power steering assist continues to give us trouble and when I called Ford customer service last week, they said since my VIN was not on the recall list, I would have to pay for the $1800.00 for repairs myself.  Last week the power assist failed while pulling into a parking spot and I almost hit another car because I could not turn my wheel. My transmission tech ran the vehicle system report yesterday 9-2-21 and we got the error, even though Ford said they could not see it. It is recall 15V340000. I assume that Ford failed to get our VIN in the recall list and we are just trying to get the manufactured defect repair completed that is not out of our pocket. How can we go about this?",

I have continued to drive the vehicle under these conditions despite the inconvenience it causes me. I am almost 45 years old. The wear this puts on my body, it's a shame. I fractured an elbow in an unrelated incident a couple years before I purchased this vehicle. It required a complete replacement with an implant. The pushing and pulling I've put on this has shortened the life of the implant. That I am with no doubt. But when this is your means to work, you have no choice but to adapt. Two months ago, I chose another vehicle to drive rather than to repair this one and \"hope\" for a recall. The problem my car has is identical to those recalled. The pictures I have added shows no doubt of that. I will not pay a cent to any dealership that represents a company that has chosen negligence over safety. It's hard to believe that manufacturers are given a choice in situations like this. A vehicle for the foundation that provides the public with safety and well being at that. I hope whoever reads this is able to take something away from it. Hopefully, it will push somebody in a different direction when time comes to purchase a new car that they're loved ones will be riding in. Maybe if a number of people have had enough of manufacturer's trying to compensate their losses by picking and choosing which cars to fix while making the average Joe pay out of pocket five times the actual cost of the repair, group together and push back against this dishonest entity.. a single voice, can be heard by a group of people that are able to do the right thing.

THE BELOW RECALL INFORMATION FROM THE NHTSA DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG, WAS FIXED BY DEALERSHIP BUT I WAS CHARGED $2,412 TO REPLACE PARTS RATHER THAN DOWNLOAD NEW CODES TO FIX THE ISSUE.  SUMMARY  FORD MOTOR COMPANY (FORD) IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2011-2012 FORD FUSION VEHICLES WITHOUT A 3.5L ENGINE AND LINCOLN MKZ HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES, 2011 MERCURY MILAN VEHICLES, 2011-2012 FORD TAURUS, FORD FLEX, LINCOLN MKS, AND LINCOLN MKT VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH A 3.5L GTDI ENGINE AND 2013 FORD TAURUS, FORD FLEX, LINCOLN MKS, AND LINCOLN MKT VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ANY AVAILABLE ENGINE. THE AFFECTED VEHICLES HAVE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING ASSIST SYSTEMS THAT MAY SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT OF A STEERING MOTOR SENSOR FAULT.  CONSEQUENCE  IF THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCES A LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST, EXTRA STEERING EFFORT WILL BE REQUIRED AT LOWER SPEEDS, INCREASING THE RISK OF A VEHICLE CRASH.  REMEDY  FORD WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL CHECK THE POWER STEERING CONTROL MODULE (PSCM) FOR DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES (DTC). IF DEALERS FIND ANY LOSS OF STEERING ASSIST DTCS, THE STEERING GEAR WILL BE REPLACED, FREE OF CHARGE. IF, NO CODES ARE FOUND DURING THE PSCM INSPECTION, THE PSCM SOFTWARE WILL BE UPDATED, FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN JULY 20, 2015. OWNERS MAY CONTACT FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 1-866-436-7332. FORD'S NUMBER FOR THIS RECALL IS 15S18.  NOTIFY  OWNERS MAY ALSO CONTACT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION VEHICLE SAFETY HOTLINE AT 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), OR GO TO WWW.SAFERCAR.GOV.",

I ONLY SMELLED IT AFTER THE CAR GOT WARMED UP AND WAS STATIONARY OR MOVING SLOW IN TOWN.  AFTER I ACCELERATED THE SMELL WOULD GO AWAY, BUT WOULD COME BACK WHEN I SLOWED DOWN AND STOPPED.
