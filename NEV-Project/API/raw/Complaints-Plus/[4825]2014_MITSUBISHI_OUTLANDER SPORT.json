FROM LOOKING AT THE MITSUBISHI FORUM (HTTPS://WWW.MITSUBISHI-FORUMS.COM/THREADS/REVERSE-CAMERA-NOT-COMING-ON.72338/#POST-360974) , APPARENTLY THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR MANY PEOPLE. ONE FORUM MEMBER STATES AN ETACS CODING ENTRY CALLED 'REAR_CMR_PRST' SAYS IT IS 'NOT PRESENT.' I FEEL THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE, PARTICULARLY WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PUBLIC PARKING SPOT. I REALIZE THIS IS A CONVENIENCE ITEM FOR MY YEAR OF VEHICLE (2014), BUT SINCE THE CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 2007 BECAME LAW AS OF MAY 1, 2018, THESE ITEMS ARE STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON ALL NEW VEHICLES.  FROM READING THE FORUM, ANY REPAIRS ARE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CONSUMER, AND MY LOCAL MITSUBISHI SHOPS HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS WRONG AND HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM. MANY IN THE FORUM MENTION 'VEHICLE SIGNAL CHECK' MENU, ETACS PROGRAMMING, CAN COMMUNICATIONS, CODING DATA, AND OTHER WIRING INFORMATION THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IS OBLIVIOUS OF.  IF REARVIEW CAMERAS ARE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT DUE TO PASSAGE OF THE ABOVE LAW, SHOULDN'T THIS ISSUE BE A SAFETY RECALL FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECT AT MANUFACTURER EXPENSE?

AS I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT AT THE HARRIS TEETER GROCERY STORE LOCATED AT 2019 S GLENBURNIE ROAD, NEW BERN, NC.  I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT ON THE LEFT.  THEREFORE, I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO SLOWLY PULL INTO THE SPOT.  AS I CONTINUED TO MOVE IN A FORWARD MOTION WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE  TO COME TO A STOP, THE CAR SUDDENLY LURCHED FORWARD.  I HAD NOT PULLED COMPLETELY INTO THE SPOT AT THE TIME, SO MY FOOT WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN ON THE BRAKE.  WHEN OUR CAR LURCHED IT THEN HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF US.  THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR CAR IMPACTED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR PARKED IN THE SPOT IN FRONT OF THE SPOT WE WERE PULLING INTO CAUSING THAT CAR TO ROLL OUT OF ITS PARKING SPOT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLE IN THE PARKING LOT.  THE CAR THAT WAS HIT HAD QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE TO THE FRONT LEFT FENDER OF THE CAR AND THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED AS IT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN. OUR CAR'S LEFT FENDER ALSO SUFFERED DAMAGE AND THE RADIATOR WAS BUSTED.  OUR CAR ALSO HAD TO BE TOWED FROM THE LOT.     WE ARE HAVING THE VEHICLE CHECKED TO SEE WHAT MADE IT LURCH.  AND HONESTLY, I WILL BE AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WHEN IT IS FIXED IF THEY FOR SOME REASON SAY THEY DON'T FIND A PROBLEM WITH IT.       I AM UPLOADING PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO BOTH CARS.  I ALSO RECEIVED A CITATION FOR THE ACCIDENT AND NOW HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO CLEAR THIS UP.  I WILL ALSO BE FILING THIS COMPLAINT DIRECTLY WITH MITSUBISHI MOTORS.       THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE, BUT I WANTED TO REPORT THIS BEFORE A SITUATION LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, POSSIBLY CAUSING MORE INJURY OR DEATH.",
