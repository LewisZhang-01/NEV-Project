THE ERROR IS BETWEEN 2 AND 3 MPH AND VARIES WITH DIFFERENT SPEEDS.  STARTING SPEED IS ZERO WITH THE ERRORS OCCURRING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS.  I HAVE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS CHECKED THE ACTUAL SPEED AGAINST LOCAL \"RADAR\" WARNING SIGNS.  IT APPEARS THAT THE DIGITAL DISPLAY IS THE MOST ACCURATE.  I HAVE TAKEN PICTURES OF THE DISCREPANCY AND SENT THEM TO THE SERVICE MANAGER.  HE THEN AGREED TO GO FOR A TEST DRIVE WITH ME.  HE CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE A TOYOTA TECH STREAM DEVICE.  I ALSO HAD HIM ACTIVATE HIS GPS SPEED PROGRAM ON HIS CELL PHONE.  THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT HIS TECH STREAM DEVICE WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AND/OR WAS DISPLAYING SPEEDS THAT WERE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE DIGITAL DISPLAY OR THE ANALOG DISPLAY (THE MAIN ROUND SPEEDOMETER NEXT TO THE TACHOMETER).  HOWEVER, HIS GPS PHONE APP INDICATED THAT THE DIGITAL DISPLAY WAS THE MOST ACCURATE.  THE RESULTS ALSO CONFIRMED THE DISCREPANCY OF 2-4 MPH BETWEEN THE ANALOG AND DIGITAL DISPLAYS.  A COMPLAINT FILED WITH TOYOTA LAST WEEK BY ME RESULTED IN A PHONE CALL FROM THEM INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WITH THE CALLER EVEN INDICATING THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS OF THIS ISSUE TO BEGIN WITH.
