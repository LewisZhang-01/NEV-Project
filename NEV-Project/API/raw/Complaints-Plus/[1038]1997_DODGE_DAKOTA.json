AT ABOUT 35,000 MILES, DURING A FRONT END ALIGNMENT, I HAD TO REPLACE THE LEFT UPPER BALL JOINT.  HAVING 25 YEARS AUTO EXPERIENCE MYSELF, THIS PART WAS DEFINITELY BAD AND I REPLACED THE WHOLE UPPER CONTROL ARM, AS THE BALL JOINT ALONE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  CURRENTLY, AT 84,000 MILES, BOTH LOWER BALL JOINTS ARE BAD AND HAVE BEEN REPLACED.  THIS VEHICLE IS NOT USED MUCH IN OFF ROAD CONDITIONS AND THEN ONLY ON PAVED ROADS.  THIS IS PREMATURE PART FAILURE AND A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AS I DRIVE AT OR ABOVE THE POISTED SPEED LIMITS IN MY TRAVELS.  TOTAL FAILURE OF THESE PARTS WOULD RESULT IN LOSS OF CONTROL AND AN ACCIDENT.  *JB",

WE HAD OUR TRUCK REPAIRED AT A LOCAL INDEPENDENT GARAGEAND ONLY THEN DID WE DISCOVER THAT OUR TRUCK HAD A 1998 PROTOTYPE TRANSMISSION IN IT.

THHE ED MURDOCK DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO REIMBURSE US FOR OUR EXPENCES, CHRYSLER SAYS THAT THEY WILL NOT BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.

ALSO, MY ENGINE CURRENTLY HAS AN OIL LEAK. THE DEALER CLAIMS IT IS THE FRONT SEAL. THE DEALER BROKE THIS SEAL WHEN THE TIMING CHAIN WAS REPLACED. THE DEALER REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE SEAL REPAIR. 2) I HAD THE TRUCK IN 3 TIMES FOR ANOTHER RATTLING NOISE IN THE A/C (INTERIOR). THE DEALER CLAIMED THE NOISE WAS NORMAL. THE FOURTH VISIT AND CONVERSATION WITH MANAGER PROVED THAT THE NOISE, IN FACT, WAS NOT NORMAL. THE DEALER REPLACED THE COMPRESSOR. AT THE CURRENT MILEAGE, THE A/C IS ONCE AGAIN MAKING THE SAME NOISE.  IN SUMMARY, THE ENGINE IS PRODUCING A RATTLING NOISE.
