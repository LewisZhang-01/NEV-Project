        "summary": "AFTER PICKING UP OUR NEW 2013 DUTCHMEN RUBICON 2900 IN MIDDLEBURY IN ON FEBRUARY 15, 2013 WE DROVE 500 MILES TO GEORGETOWN KY. AFTER ARRIVING IT WAS DISCOVERED THE PAN HOLDING THE PROPANE TANKS TO THE FRONT TONGUE OF THE TRAILER WAS VERY LOOSE AND SLIDING AROUND ON THE TRAILER FRAME. AFTER REMOVING THE TANKS I DISCOVERED 3 OF THE 4 SELF TAPING SCREWS HOLDING THE TANK PAN ON THE FAME HAD THE HEADS BUSTED OFF. ALL 3 OF THE MISSING SCREW HEADS WERE RUSTED GIVEN THE INDICATION THE SCREWS HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF AND HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER LONG ENOUGH TO RUST. THE 1 REMAINING SCREW HOLDING THE PROPANE TANKS ON THE TRAILER WAS LOOSE ENOUGH TO UNSCREW BY HAND. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TRAVELING TO TEXAS I HAD TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE PROPANE TANKS AND PAN FROM THE TRAILER AND STORE IN THE BED OF TOW VEHICLE UNTIL WE ARRIVED HOME TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR. DURING THE 500 MILE TRIP THE PAN WITH PROPANE TANKS WAS SLIDING FORWARD AND REARWARD ON THE TONGUE.  *TR",
