I WAS THEN ABLE TO VERY SLOWLY MOVE THE CAR IN FIRST GEAR WITH THE FLASHERS GOING, AND FORTUNATELY WAS CLOSE TO A SIDE STREET WHERE I PARKED THE CAR AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP.     ALTHOUGH HONDA REPLACED MY TRANSMISSION FOR FREE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BACK IN 2007, THE CAR HAS LOW MILEAGE FOR THE LIFE OF THE TRANSMISSION.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE REFUSING TO COVER THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THE TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS SUDDEN AND LITERALLY SEIZED UP THE CAR AND PUT MY LIFE IN DANGER.  THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO HONDA.  I AM REGISTERING THIS COMPLAINT NOT ONLY TO GET SATISFACTION FROM HONDA, BUT ALSO TO WARN OTHER ODYSSEY OWNERS THAT THIS MAY HAPPEN TO THEM, AND LET THEM KNOW THIS IS POTENTIALLY DEADLY.   *TR",

THE ENGINE STOPPED MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE DRIVING TILL I GOT THE PART REPLACED.  THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE RECALL DID NOT WORK, AND  THE REPLACED PARTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE ORIGINAL RECALL ( OVERHEATING SWITCH) . I HAVE REPLACED THE SWITCH.

I THEN HEARD A PIECE OF METAL SLIDING DOWN THE ROADWAY BEHIND ME. AFTER PULLING OVER AND NOTICING THAT MY FRONT RIGHT TIRE HAD BEEN PUNCTURED AND GOING FLAT, I RETRIEVED THE LARGE PIECE OF COILED METAL FROM THE ROADWAY. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS A BROKEN COIL SPRING, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE SPRINGS WERE OK. I REPLACED THE TIRE AND PROCEEDED SLOWLY BELIEVING THAT I HAD PROBABLY RUN OVER THE BROKEN SPRING WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE ROADWAY BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES DOWN THE ROAD I HEARD THE SAME SOUND, AND ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL SLIDING DOWN THE ROAD. I RETRIEVED THAT PIECE OF METAL AND COMPARED IT WITH THE FIRST, AND IT IS A NEAR DUPLICATE MATCH, INCLUDING THE LOCATION OF THE BREAK. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, I NOTICED THAT MY VAN HAD BROKEN BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE FRONT COIL SPRINGS, NEARLY IDENTICALLY, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL BECAUSE THEY APPEARED TO STILL BE SEATED PROPERLY IN THE COIL HOUSING CLOSEST TO THE TIRE. IT APPEARS THAT THE BROKEN COIL SPRINGS ARE RUSTED THROUGH THE BLACK MANUFACTURERS PAINT AT THE LOCATION OF THE FRACTURE.  I HAD TWO OF MY CHILDREN WITH ME AT THE TIMES OF THE BREAKS. I ESTIMATE MY SPEED AT 50 MPH ON THE FIRST BREAK, ON THE TWO LANE ROADWAY, AND THE ROADWAY WAS LEVEL, CLEAR AND DRY.

AFTER TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES ON I-65 (SOUTH) I NOTICED A SMELL LIKE HOT INSULATION AND SEVERAL MINUTES LATE SAW SMOKE RISING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN COVER.   SMOKING CONTINUED AS I PROCEEDED TOWARD AN EXIT.  I FELT THE TOP STEERING COLUMN COVER AND IT FELT WARM OVER THE LEFT TOP SIDE AS THE SMOKE CONTINUED.  AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 MIN, THE ENGINE STALLED AND ALL OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER GAUGES STOPPED WORKING.     I COASTED TO A STOP ALONG THE SIDE OF I-65 AND THE SMOKE DISSIPATED.   THE ENGINE WOULD NOT RE-START.    THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED BUT I SUSPECT THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH OVERHEATED AND FAILED.   THE IGNITION SWITCH HAD BEEN RECALLED AND REPLACED IN 2002 AS PART OF NHTSA RECALL.  *JB",

ON 8/2/04, THE CAR BROKE DOWN AND LATER FOUND OUT THE ALTERNATOR BRACKET BROKE (SHEARED IN HALF). HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE LATER PAID FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BRACKET. ON 8/27/05, THE BRACKET BROKE AGAIN IN HIGH WAY. HONDA AGAIN PAID FOR THE REPAIR AT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP (LUNDGREN IN MA SINCE WE WERE TRAVELING OUTSIDE NY). I COMPLAINED BOTH TIME AND THIS TIME QUESTIONED IF THE DESIGN OR PART IS AT FAULT. HONDA TOLD ME THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT THE TORQUE OF THE SCREWS FOR THIS BRACKET SO I ASKED IT TO BE DOUBLE CHECKED. THE CAR WAS THEN CHECKED AT NARDY HONDA IN OCT. 05 (PAID FOR BY HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN). ON 2/4/06, THE CAR BROKE DOWN AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT IS THE BOLT THAT HOLDS THE ALTERNATOR TO THE BRACKET. I HAVE THE BROKEN BOLT AND BRACKET FROM THE 2ND TIME. I HAVE CALLED HONDA SERVICE AGAIN AND QUESTIONED THE DESIGN, PART, AND OR SERVICE PROCEDURE TO BE AT FAULT SINCE I BELIEVE THE ASSEMBLY SEEMS TO FAIL INSTANTLY UNDER HIGH STRESSES CAUSED BY EITHER THE TENSION OF THE BELT ENGAGEMENT OR CONSTANT TENSION.  THE BOLT WAS SHEARED OFF AS WELL. BOTH FAILURES INDICATE HIGH STRESSES. HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN OR WILL DO FOR ME THIS TIME. NOW, I AM REALLY WORRIED THAT THE CAR CAN BREAK DOWN ANY TIME AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS IF THE DRIVER OTHER THAN ME (MY WIFE OR MY SON) DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE SUDDEN BREAK DOWN. I ALSO NOW QUESTION IF THE INITIAL REPAIR WAS NOT CAUSED BY BAD ALTERNATOR BUT WAS THE FACT THAT THE BRACKET WAS ALSO BROKEN SO THE ALTERNATOR WON'T CHARGE AS THE BELT WAS STUCK.  *NM",

EGR KIT HAS BEEN REPLACED 5 TIMES, REMAINING VISITS ACCOUNTED FOR MY CLEANING EGR PORTS, REPLACING THE EGR VALVE, AND REPLACING THE GAS CAP.  I'VE HAD OTHER VEHICLES FOR 7+ YEARS AND NEVER REPLACED A GAS CAP!  THIS VEHICLE HAS GONE THROUGH 2?  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS TIED TO THE EMISSIONS SYSTEM.  AS A RESULT, VEHICLE IS NOW HAVING PROBLEMS PASSING INSPECTION.  DURING THE LAST VISIT, LOCAL DEALER REPLACED THE EGR KIT IN ORDER TO GET THE 05 INSPECTION COMPLETED.  TWO WEEKS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AGAIN.  IN ADDITION, INTERNAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND IN THE TRANSMISSION IN AUG 03.  DEALER AGREED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM IN GOOD FAITH.  THIS WAS PRIOR TO THE OFFICIAL RECALL NOTICE.  AT THE TIME OF SERVICE THE MILEAGE WAS CLOCKED AT 81823.  LESS THAN 1 YEAR LATER (JUNE 2004), IT WAS DISCOVERED BY AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE THAT THE LEFT AXLE SEAL GOING INTO THE TRANSMISSION WAS CRACKED AND THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS EXTREMELY GRITTY.  WHEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY ON THE NEW TRANSMISSION AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY SERVICE REQUIRED (MILEAGE WAS CLOCKED AT 102000).    AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF 3 YOUNG CHILDREN, MY MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSPORT THEM IN A SAFE, RELIABLE MANNER.  GIVEN THE EXTENT OF MY EMISSION AND TRANSMISSION ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED, I CANNOT DEPEND ON THIS VEHICLE.     THIS SITUATION WAS FIRST DOCUMENTED TO HONDA IN NOV 2000.  AT THAT TIME THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 6 YEARS/75,000 MILES.  ANOTHER LETTER WAS SENT CERTIFIED MAIL (SIGNED FOR ON 6 AUG 2004).  I'VE YET TO HEAR BACK FROM HONDA.

SINCE I HAVE HAD THE CAR THE DRIVER SIDE REAR SLIDING DOOR HAS MALFUNCTIONED IN SPITE OF BEING SERVICED ABOUT 4 TIMES. THE WARNING LIGHT COMES ON AND THE ALARM GOES OFF. I HAVE TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, OPEN THE DOOR AND CLOSE IT AGAIN AND THEN IT'S OK.  THE MOST RECENT TIME IT WAS SERVICED, THE COST WAS $600 AND SUPPOSEDLY ALL OF THE DOOR SENSORS ON THE FRAME AND THE DOOR WERE REPLACED.  THAT WAS ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO.  SINCE THEN THE ALARM SOUNDS LESS OFTEN HOWEVER, THE ALARM HAS GONE OFF WHILE I'M DRIVING THE CAR,  THE DOOR HAS FAILED TO CLOSE AND I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, GET OUT AND PUSH THE DOOR AS IT WAS CLOSING AND SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I TRIED TO LOCK THE CAR WITH THE REMOTE, I HAD TO WALK BACK TO THE CAR, OPEN AND CLOSE THE DOOR BECAUSE THE ALARM INDICATOR SHOWED THE DOOR AJAR.  I UNDERSTAND THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE ODYSSEY.  LAST NIGHT I WAS A NEWS STORY THAT VEHICLES INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS ARE SOMETIMES AUCTIONED AND MOVE FROM DEALER TO DEALER AND THE PAPER HISTORY OF THE CAR IS CHANGED. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A CAR THAT HAS BEEN IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAS ENDED UP ON A NEW CAR DEALERS LOT AND WAS SOLD AS CERTIFIED.  THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AS I OFTEN HAVE MY GRANDCHILDREN IN MY CAR IN CAR SEATS.  IF IT IS FIXABLE, IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS MUCH EFFORT TO FIX.  SINCE IT HAS TAKEN TRY AFTER TRY AND I STILL HAVE A MALFUNCTIONING DOOR I CAN ONLY THINK THAT MAYBE THE FRAME OF THE CAR IS DAMAGED.  PLEASE HELP ME OUT WITH THIS SITUATION.

THE DEALER (FIRESTONE TIRE & SERVICE IN REDWOOD CITY, 650-364-1900) TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND THE TIRE TO A LAB FOR ANALYSIS. AS OF LAST WEEK, THEY STILL HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY WORD BACK FROM THE LAB. ON JULY 28, THE NEWLY INSTALLED TIRE (WITH LESS THAN 1,000 MILES ON IT) BLEW OUT UNDER SIMILAR HIGH HEAT-65 MPH CONDITIONS. AGAIN, THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE OFF THE ROAD SAFELY. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COINCIDENCE OF TWO FIRESTONE TIRES BLOWING OUT UNDER THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED. HAS THE NTSB RECEIVED OTHER COMPALINTS ABOUT BLOW-OUTS FROM CAR OWNERS WHOSE CARS USE THE SAME TIRE BRAND (I REALIZE THESE ARE NOT AMONG THE RECALLED TIRES). I HAVE SINCE REPLACED ALL THE TIRES WITH MICHELIN TIRES AND CONTACTED FIRESTONE ABOUT COMPENSATION AND FOLLOWING UP ON THE LAB ANALYSIS. THE SECOND TIRE ALSO SUFFERED AN EXTERIOR WALL BLOW-OUT ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS SEVERELY DAMAGED AS THE FIRST. I STILL HAVE THE SECOND BLOWN-OUT TIRE AND ALL THE REMAINING FIRESTONE TIRES THAT CAME ON MY VEHICLE.
