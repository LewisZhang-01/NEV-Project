I WENT TO PICK UP MY VAN AND WHEN I SAW IT  THEY PUT IT A DIFFERENT HORN AND TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD PASS INSPECTION AND THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE PART THAT THE VAN NEEDED IF I WAS WILLING TO PAY HALF ON IT.

THERE WAS NO PRIOR INDICATION OF THE FAILURE, AND THE VEHICLE HAD NEVER BEEN ABUSED OR INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE IS A 1997 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN LS, AND THE WHEEL IN QUESTION IS THE FACTORY OPTIONAL ALUMINUM CAST ITEM.  WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER, AND WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS OUR FAULT.       THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL, IT HAD NEVER BEEN ABUSED, THERE  WAS NO AIR LEAKAGE OVER TIME TO INDICATE A CRACK OR FAULT, THE TEMPERATURE AT THE TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 DEGREES F., AND THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE IN THE ROAD WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT.  THE WHEEL SIMPLY BROK INTO TWO PIECES.     WE FEEL THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBLE DEFECT SINCE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED FAILURE OF SUCH A VITAL PIECE OF VEHICLE EQUIPMENT COULD OBVIOUSLY PROVE FATAL.  IF THIS HAD OCCURRED ON AN INTERSTATE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, OR IF THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL HAD FAILED, PULLING THE VEHICLE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, THE POSSIBLE RESULTS ARE OBVIOUS.

THE PROBLEM IS THE TRANSMISSION CAN BE EASLY OUT OF PARKING BY KIDS. OTHER CARS EVEN MY 1991 TOYOTA NEEDS  YOU TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE BEFORE YOU CAN ENGAGE THE TRANSMITION. D/ CHRYSLER IS CLAIMING THAT IS STATED ON THE MANUAL NOT TO LEAVE THE KID IN THE CAR. BUY THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSES TO PUT AMERCAN KID IN DANGER. I WAS ADVISED TO SELL THE CAR BUT  I AM NOT WILLING TO PUT ANOTHER KIDS IN DANGER, PLEASE TALK TO CHYSLER TO STOP PUTTING THIS AS OPTION BUT AS PART OF SAVETY IN THE CAR. WHY ORDINARY CARS IN OTHER MODEL ARE EQUIPED WITH THIS SAFETY IN MIND AND WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW CHRISYLER TO PUT OUR KIDS IN DANGER BECAUSE OF THEIR SELFISH ACT?.FOR A REMINDER , THE PROBLEM IS THE ''TRANSMISSION ENGAGE EASLY FROM PARKING EVEN IF THE IGNITION IS NOT ON OR KEY ON THE IGNITION. IF YOU ARE REVIEWING THIS CASE, AMERICA KIDS LIFE IS IN YOUR HAND. PLEASE HANDLE WITH CARE.THANKS. *AK",

HOWEVER, I ONCE AGAIN WAS UNABLE TO STOP MY VAN NO MATTER HOW HARD I STOOD ON THE PEDAL!  I BARELY MISSED OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, CROSSED OVER A SIDEWALK AND HIT A HOUSE THAT LINED THE ROAD.  I ENDED UP IN AN EMPTY LOT BESIDE THE HOUSE I HAD HIT.  MY SON SUFFERED BRUISING ON HIS UPPER LEGS FROM BEING BOUNCED AROUND AND I SUFFERED A CUT HAND AND CONTINUE TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH MY BACK.

WE LIVE ON A STEEP HILL AND FROM AUG, 1997-DEC, 2000, WE PRIMARILY PARKED THE VAN IN THE GARAGE WHERE IT WAS LEVEL.  IN DEC, 2000, WE STARTED PARKING IT ON THE HILL AND STARTED NOTICING A GAS SMELL AND A GAS DRIP FROM THE TANK WHEN THE CAR WAS PARKED UP HILL.  MOST LIKELY THE LEAK HAS BEEN FROM DAY ONE AND WHEN WE HAD A FULL TANK AND DROVE UP THE HILL, SOME OF IT WOULD LEAK OUT.  THE SERVICING DEALER (HAYES CHRYSLER, LAWRENCEVILLE, GA) IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM IN MARCH, 2001 AND ESTIMATED A ~$700 REPAIR TO REPLACE THE TANK, AS THE GASKETS WERE MOST LIKELY THE PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS MORE RELIABLE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE TANK.  I BELIEVE, THIS WAS AN IMPROPER AND HIGH QUOTE AND STATED SUCH AND THEN I REQUESTED A REPAIR UNDER SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS AND ASKED THEM TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER'S REP.

THE NEGHERBON SERVICE DEPT HAD REPLACED THE CALIPER KIT (SPRINGS AND TRACKS) ON 3/13/01. THE WHEEL GETS SO HOT THAT YOU BURN YOUR FINGER IF YOU TOUCH IT. THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY TIME. THE OVERHEATING HAPPENS DURING TIMES WHEN THE BRAKES ARE USED OFTEN (BENICIA IS VERY HILLY), AND DOES NOT HAPPEN DURING HIGHWAY RIDES, WHEN THERE IS NO TRAFFIC. MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN THE BRAKES STARTS TO HEAT UP DO TO USE, THE CALIPER DOES NOT RELEASE AS FREELY, AND EVENTUALLY LOCKS UP AND DOES NOT RELEASE AT ALL (AFTER THE 1ST INCIDENT I HAD TO HAMMER OFF THE OLD BRAKE PADS/CALIPER ASSEMBLY FROM THE ROTOR).

I CALLED A DODGE DEALER, BUT I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT THAT FAR, SO I DROVE TO THE CLOSEST FULL SERVICE GARAGE.  THE MECHANIC GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL, AND BEFORE HE GOT IT OUT OF THE LOT, HE PULLED BACK IN AND SAID HE THOUGHT HE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE RAISED THE VAN UP, AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE ENGINE FALLING OUT.  HE SAID TO STAY OUT OF THE VAN THAT IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.  I IMMEDIATELY HAD IT TOWED TO THE DODGE DEALER.  THEY VERIFIED THE ENGINE WAS FALLING OUT AND KEPT THE VAN A FEW DAYS TO INSTALL TWO BOLTS THAT THEY SAID WERE MISSING.  I ASKED THEM IF IT WAS A FACTORY ERROR AND HE SAID NO - THE BOLTS WERE IN AT ONE TIME AND SOMEHOW FELL OUT.  P.S.  WE HAD TO RENT A CAR FOR 6 DAYS WHILE IT WAS REPAIRED.
