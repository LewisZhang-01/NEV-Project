I am sure there have been hundreds if not thousands of complaints about same issue and GM refuses to fix the problem. The problem causes the car to randomly shut off due to anti theft fault and can happen on interstate, highway or in town driving. This is a very dangerous fault and very expensive for owners especially when dealerships themselves don't even know what they are dealing with. They will throw parts at the problem with no real knowledge. GM needs to be held accountable. Currently the ignition the BCM have been replaced and now the car will not start at all and I have no lights or gauges on my cluster.",

IT FIRST BEGUN OVER A YEAR AGO, WHERE MY CAR WOULD NOT START LEAVING ME STRANDED. THE CAR SAT FOR NEARLY 4- DAYS, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO! THE CAR HAS VERY LOW MILES, ONLY 60,000 ORIGINAL; DON'T DRIVE MUCH, REALLY ONLY TO AND FROM WORK DAILY AND MAYBE TO THE FOOD STORE HERE AND THERE. ANYWAY, I WOUND UP GOOGLING \"2002 CHEVY MALIBU NOT STARTING\", PROBLEMS WITH THE PASS LOCK THEFT SYSTEM CAME UP, TELLING ME TO TRY THE 10- MINUTE RESET BY PUTTING THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND TURNING TO ON W/OUT TURNING THE ENGINE ON FOR 10- MINUTES, REMOVING THE KEY, WAITING 5 SECONDS AND THEN PUTTING THE KEY BACK INTO THE IGNITION. FIGURED WHAT THE HECK, IT DOESN'T HURT TO TRY IT!! WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW, IT WORKED!!! WELL FOR THE PAST YEAR NOW MY CAR HAS LEFT ME STRANDED ROUGHLY 3 - 4 TIMES A MONTH BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. EACH TIME I HAD TO DO THE 10- MINUTE RESET AND IT WOULD THEN START RIGHT UP. I SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS, THIS IS CRAZY AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED AT CHEVY/GM'S EXPENSE, NOT MINE. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THERE ARE OVER 3,000 COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS ISSUE!!! I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CONSTANTLY WORRY ABOUT MY CAR NOT STARTING BECAUSE OF A FAULTY THEFT SYSTEM THAT WAS BUT IN MY CAR BY GM. CHEVY. ON SEPTEMBER 10TH 2014 I GOT IN MY CAR TO TAKE MY SON TO SCHOOL AND GO TO WORK, CAR WOULD NOT START, TRIED THE 10-MINUTE RESET, THIS TIME IT DID NOT WORK, WAITED 4- HOURS FOR A TOW TRUCK, SON MISSED SCHOOL AND I WAS LATE TO WORK! WELL, BECAUSE OF ME HAVING TO KEEP CRANKING MY CAR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BECAUSE OF IT NOT STARTING BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY THEFT SYSTEM BLEW OUT MY STARTER AND BATTERY. WAS WITHOUT A CAR FOR A WEEK AND A HALF GOT MY CAR BACK AND THE THEFT SYSTEM ISSUE HAS STARTED AGAIN!!!  *TR",

THEY SAID THE GM REPRESENTATIVE DECLINED THE REPAIRS. I THEN TOOK MY CAR TO AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER AND HAD IT RECHECKED. AGAIN THE DIAGNOSTIC WAS THE PASS LOCK SYSTEM.

OUR LOCAL MECHANIC STATED THE REARS WERE IMPROPERLY DONE AND WERE NOT WORKING AT ALL.  THE PADS WERE INSTALLED BACKWARDS AND THE SPRINGS NOT ATTACHED.

HE BASICALLY DENIED THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM AND TOLD US TO LEAVE.  HERE ARE A FEW THINGS HE SAID TO US WHEN WE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION.  HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WORK?.  WE HAD TESTED THE PARKING BRAKE AND IT WOULDN'T HOLD THE CAR AT ALL.  HE SAID, THE E-BRAKE ISN'T DESIGNED TO DO THAT. HOW DID YOU GET THE CAR HERE IF YOUR BRAKES DON'T WORK? I AM NOT GOING TO GUARANTEE ANYTHING. I AM NOT GOING TO REFUND ANY OF YOUR MONEY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIX THEM YOURSELF?  ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP ARGUING WITH ME? YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE THE CAR SOMEWHERE ELSE. TIRED OF HIS CONDESCENDING BELLIGERENT AND INSULTING ATTITUDE, WE INSTEAD WENT TO THEIR LEMON AVE LOCATION DOWNTOWN.  THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL AND IMMEDIATELY FIXED THE BRAKES QUICKLY AND COURTEOUSLY.   THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AS WE HAD BEEN DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE WITH ONLY THE FRONT BRAKES WORKING FOR OVER 3 MONTHS.  IT ALSO COST US LESS THEN HALF OF WHAT JUST BRAKES WANTED TO REPAIR THE FRONT END AT OUR LOCAL MECHANIC.

I GET THE CALL FROM THEM SAYING ITS THE FUEL PUMP(ANOTHER COMMON UNNECESSARY FIX THAT YOU HERE REPEAT OVER AND OVER. HE ALSO SAID THE ANTITHEFT LIGHT WAS ON AND THAT I SOMEHOW DEMAGNITIZED THE KEY(WASN'T POSSIBLE BECAUSE I WAS GIVEN A ALL SILVER KEY NO CHIP IN IT) SO THAT COST ALMOST A EXTRA HUNDRED FOR THE KEY.SO AFTER IM RIDING ALMOST FINE TORQUE COULD BE MORE V6ISH BUT I DIGRESS TUESDAY SEP 4 2012 NOT A MONTH LATER IT DOESN'T START AGAIN, AND AGAIN ON MY WAY TO WORK. THIS TIME I HAD IT TOWED AND BY THE TIME IT MADE IT TO THE MECHANIC ITS WAS STARTING FINE.

THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN, AT WHICH POINT I COULD HAVE IT TOWED THERE AND THEY QUOTED ME $650+ TO REPLACE IGNITION ASSEMBLY (WHAT THEY CONSIDERED THE \"LIKELY\" CAUSE).  CAR ALSO MAKES OUTSIDE HORN NOISES RANDOMLY AND THE INSIDE ALARM CHIMES RANDOMLY.  I'VE READ ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS, EVEN ONE WOMAN WHOSE CAR JUST STOPPED WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY DUE TO THIS ANTITHEFFT SYSTEM PROBLEM.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS DEFECT NEEDING RECALL AND OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS ON MANY LEVELS.  THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ON AUTO COMPLAINT SITES (IE., AUTOFORUM) AND I CAN SEE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE AS WELL.

I HAVE ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS STARTING MY CAR AND USUALLY WOULD HAVE TO TURN IT ON TO MAKE SURE ALL THE LIGHTS COME ON, NOT JUST THE ANTI-THEFT LIGHT.  IF ONLY THE ANTI-THEFT LIGHT COMES ON, ITS GUARANTEED TO NOT START.  AT EXACTLY 111,111 MILES MY CAR WOULD NOT START AT ALL NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TOOK THE KEY OUT AND PUT IT BACK IN.  IT KEPT FLASHING THE ANTI-THEFT AT ME! I REPLACED THE IDOL SPEED MOTOR AND FOR SOME REASON IT STARTED. A WEEK LATER IT WOULDN'T START AGAIN. I READ ABOUT TRICKS ONLINE TO GET THE CAR TO START BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROMINENT PROBLEM WITH 2002'S. I FINALLY GOT THE CAR STARTED. A FEW DAYS LATER I WAS DRIVING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY WHEN I CAME TO A STOP LIGHT AND MY CAR JUST SHUT OFF.  I WAS STILL ABLE TO USE MY BREAKS, THANK GOD, BUT HAD TO SIT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC TRYING TO START MY CAR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. I KEEP THINKING WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS WHEN MY 2-YEAR-OLD IS WITH ME?  WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS IN THE DARK AND SOMEONE REAR ENDS ME BECAUSE MY LIGHTS GO OUT?  I HAVE HAD THE FUEL PUMP CHECKED, THE FUEL INJECTORS, THE IDLE SPEED MOTOR REPLACED EVERY TIME I REPLACE SOMETHING IT WORKS FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS THEN IT STARTS TO ACT UP AGAIN. THE POINT IS THAT THE PROBLEM ALWAYS COMES BACK AND IT SEEMS TO GET WORST, AND HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY WITH EVERY FAILURE.  THE PROBLEM COULD BE THE IGNITION CYLINDER WITCH IS WHAT I AM HAVING FIXED NEXT, BUT I HAVE ACQUAINTANCES THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT COME BACK EVEN AFTER REPLACING THE IGNITION CYLINDER.  MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS HAVING EVERYTHING DIE AGAIN WHILE I AM DRIVING BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST A INCONVENIENCE ANYMORE, IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT CHEVY NEEDS TO ADDRESS BEFORE THERE ARE DEATHS AND OR SERIOUS INJURIES. *TR",

WAS THE NEED TO CHANGE THE STARTER SWITCH AND IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER FOR WHICH THEY CHARGED ME FOR A STARTER SWITCH - $96.15, AN IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER - $154.79, RECODE THE LOCK CYLINDER - $15.00, AND $46.00 TO CORRECT THE PASS LOCK SENSOR DATA, PLUS A $10.00 ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL FEE.

THE TEMPORARY FIX IS TO RESET THE SYSTEM BY TURNING THE IGNITION KEY TO THE ON POSITION AND WAITING 10-15 MINUTES.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS IS VERY ANNOYING AND INCONVENIENT.  AT THIS POINT IT DOESN'T REPRESENT AN IMMEDIATE SAFETY ISSUE, IN THAT THE IGNITION SYSTEM ISN'T SHUTTING DOWN WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING.

I HAD NO TURN SIGNALS OR HAZARD BLINKERS UNTIL IT WAS REPLACED.  GIBSON CHEVY OF SOUTH HOLLAND, IL DID THE REPLACEMENT (IT'S IN THEIR REPAIR SYSTEM).  MY CAR PRESENTLY HAS A LITTLE OVER 45K MILES.

AT SPEEDS 1, 2 AND 3, THE BLOWER MOTOR WOULDN'T WORK AT ALL.  EACH SPEED STARTING WITH THE LOWEST TO THE HIGHER SPEEDS WAS GOING OUT-THE ONLY SPEEDS WORKING WERE #4, #5 & DEFROST.

MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY.

OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.

I HAD THE SERVICE DONE AS I THOUGHT CONTINUING TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE MIGHT HAVE POSED A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.  SO THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND MY COST WAS $1,700.00.

WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE IN JANUARY THE WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID FROZE WITHIN THE TUBES AND WOULD NOT COME OUT.  THIS CREATES A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH ROAD SALT SPLASHED FROM OTHER CARS FAIRLY QUICKLY BUILDS UP ON YOUR WINDSHIELD AND YOU CAN HARDLY SEE OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD WHILE DRIVING OVER 60 MPH ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.  THE DAY WAS COLD, PERHAPS 14 DEGREES, BUT NOT EXTREMELY COLD AND THIS WAS PENNSYLVANIA NOT MINNESOTA NOR CANADA.  MY GUESS IS THAT THE 14 DEGREES WEATHER PLUS DRIVING AT 70 MILES PER HOUR CREATES A WINDCHILL THAT IS BELOW THE -20 DEGREES THAT THE WASHER FLUID IS GOOD FOR.  BUT IT IS ON COLD WINTER DAYS THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY NEED THE WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID BECAUSE OF THE SALT LEFT ON THE ROAD.   THE FLUID BEGAN TO FLOW AGAIN WHEN I GOT INTO SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES IN MARYLAND.  I NEVER DILUTED THE WINDSHIELD FLUID WITH WATER.  FOR THIS WINTER I HAVE BOUGHT WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID THAT IS GOOD TO MINUS 38 DEGREES AND HAVE ALSO BOUGHT AN ALCOHOL ADDITIVE FOR THE FLUID THAT WILL MAKE IT GOOD TO ABOUT MINUS 40 DEGREES AND I WILL SEE IF THAT WORKS.  BUT MANY DRIVERS WON'T KNOW AHEAD OF TIME TO DO THAT, AND ALMOST ALL GAS STATIONS ONLY SELL THE STANDARD -20 FLUID.  I THINK THAT CAR MANUFACTURERS IN DESIGNING FUTURE MODELS SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM OF WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID COMING OUT OF SLITS IN THE HOOD INSTEAD OF COMING OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  *LA",

THE SAID THAT BRAKES DON'T ALWAYS LAST LONG, BUT WERE ABLE TO GET SRV. REP. TO REFUND $185.  DLR AGREED TO REPLACE ROTORS IF I HAD MORE TROUBLE W/ BRAKES IN NEXT 10,000 MI. THAT MEANS I COULD HAVE A WHOLE BRAKE JOB AT 28,000 AT MY EXPENSE.  I AM NOT HAPPY.  A COMMONLY HELD IDEA IS THAT BRAKES SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER.  I DON'T RIDE MY BRAKES AND TRAVEL TO WORK ON PAVED RURAL ROADS WITHOUT MUCH TRAFFIC.  I DO LOTS OF X-WAY DRIVING AND DON'T TAILGATE. TRADED IN A 1998 MALIBU DUE TO TROUBLE WITH MANIFOLD GASKET, AIR-CON ODOR. PREVIOUSLY HAD WARPED ROTORS AND A NEED TO REPLACE BRAKES MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN 6 PREV. CARS ON SAME DIRT ROAD.
