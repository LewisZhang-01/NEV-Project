THAT'S 3 OUT OF 4 SO FAR AND I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON THE LAST ONE BECAUSE CHANCES ARE IT WILL FAIL TOO. THE FOLKS AT THE FIRESTONE DEALER INSIST THIS IS AN ISOLATED CASE AND THEY KNOW OF ON OTHER FAILURES OF THIS MODEL AND SIZE TIRE, BUT I DON'T FEEL SAFE RIDING ON THEM. THE DEFECTIVE TIRES ARE BEING REPLACED AT NO COST TO ME, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY MONEY BACK AND GO BUY SOMETHING OTHER THAN FIRESTONE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF FAILURE ANALYSIS, IF ANY, FIRESTONE IS DOING ON MY DEFECTIVE TIRES AND IF THEY REPORTED ANYTHING TO YOU.  *AK (DOT NUMBER: VDYK4RA218  TIRESIZE: 32X11.5R15)",

WE PULLED OVER AND NOTICED SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE SIDEWALL OF THE LEFT REAR TIRE. IT WAS NOT FLAT. I NURSED IT HOME AND DROVE IT TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER THE NEXT DAY. THEY SHOWED ME A LARGE GAPING HOLE IN THE TREAD THAT I HADN'T NOTICED. THEY GAVE ME A NEW TIRE FREE OF ALL CHARGES. WHEN I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE IN JUNE 1999, IT HAD THE SAME SIZE AND MODEL TIRES ON IT AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ONE OF THEM, PROMPTING ME TO BUY A NEW SET. THOSE ORIGINAL TIRES WERE OLD AND CRACKED (BUT STILL HAD PLENTY OF TREAD) SO I DID NOT THINK AT THAT TIME THE FIRST FAILURE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH MANUFACTURER'S DEFECTS. MY WIFE AND I ARE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THESE TIRES NOW. HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY OTHER REPORTS OF FAILURE FOR THIS MODEL TIRE AND SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED?
