I HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY SHIFT TO NEUTRAL AND RESTART THE CAR. IT HAPPENS DURING RUSH HOUR SO I END UP MAKING OTHER DRIVERS ANGRY WHICH IS DANGEROUS. THE OTHER ONGOING ISSUE I HAVE IS THE CAR ACCELERATING BY ITSELF. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS AND HAS GOT INCREASINGLY WORSE. I NOW HAVE OTHER WITNESS' PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR AND HAD IT HAPPEN. AT MIDAS WHERE I GET MY CAR REPAIRED, THEY DROVE IT AND COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE BUT DEFINITELY SCARED HIM. THE MECHANIC THOUGHT IT IS COMPUTER RELATED. THEY TRIED TO FIND A FIX ONLINE BUT COULDN'T. SOMEONE HIT MY CAR AND IT WAS AT A SHOP BEING REPAIRED FOR 2 WEEKS. THIS IS A VERY LARGE OPERATION. WHEN I WENT TO PICK IT UP THE MECHANIC THERE SAID THAT EVERYONE, AFTER DRIVING MY CAR ONCE, REFUSED TO DRIVE IT AGAIN. IT SCARED THEM TO DEATH. SHE EXPLAINED HOW IT KEPT ACCELERATING AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THEIR FOOT ON THE GAS, THERE WERE NO CAR MATS, NO EXPLANATION. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND IT WILL START REVING. WHEN I'M STOPPED AT LIGHTS IT DOES. WHEN I START THE CAR, STILL IN PARK, IT STARTS.THEY STATED THEY DON'T EVER WANT TO DRIVE AND/OR PARK IT AGAIN. THEY SAID IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. I KNOW FORD DENIES THE ISSUE BUT THIS IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I AM AWARE OF THE ISSUE SO I DRIVE IT LIKE IT'S A STICK SHIFT IN TRAFFIC AND ALWAYS HAVE MY FOOT READY FOR IT TO ACCELERATE.

THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE MUSTANG WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL/TIRE/SUSPENSION ASSEMBLY WAS RIPPED OFF THE CAR. THE POINT OF IMPACT WAS BETWEEN THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL AND THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVER'S DOOR.   THE MUSTANG IS A ONE-OWNER CAR WHICH WAS BOUGHT NEW AND WAS SPECIFICALLY PURCHASED WITH SIDE AIRBAGS (AN OPTION ON 2007 MUSTANGS). THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN WELL-MAINTAINED.

SO WE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THREE VALVE STEMS BECAUSE OF THE CRACKING AND LEAKING, TODAY THE 4TH ONE STARTED LEAKING.  LUCKILY MY NEIGHBORHOOD TIRE SHOP DOES NOT CHARGE VERY MUCH TO REPLACE THEM IF I TAKE THE WHEEL OFF MYSELF AND TAKE IT UP THERE, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET BACK THE MONEY FOR THE TROUBLE.  BUT, IF IT WASN'T FOR FORD'S LOW PRESSURE WARNING AND US BEING VIGILANT STICKLERS FOR VEHICLE MAINTENANCE, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.

WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY SAID THE RIGHT REAR TIRE JUST HAD LOW AIR PRESSURE, THEY PUT AIR IN IT AND CHARGED FOR THEIR INSPECTION?  THE NEXT DAY THE LIGHT WAS BACK ON....WENT BACK TO DEALER, THEY SAID THE SENSOR IS UNRELIABLE AND THEY SEE NOTHING WRONG SO WE HAD THEM BALANCE AND ROTATE THE TIRES.  OCT 4TH DRIVING 65 MPH DOWN I-20 RIGHT REAR TIRE BLEW OUT; ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF CAR, RAN OUT ACROSS THE GRASS TO GET THE VEHICLE STOPPED AND UNDER CONTROL. TOOK THE TIRE TO THE DEALER THE NEXT MORNING; THEY SAY IS BLEW BECAUSE IT WAS LOW IN AIR??? NO LOW PRESSURE LIGHT? THEY ALREADY WORKED ON THE SAME TIRE 3 TIMES...THEY STILL REFUSE.  TOOK TIRE TO A TIRE STORE: FACTS ARE:  TIRE VALVE STEM IS CRACKED AND WAS ON THE RECALL, AIR LEAKED OUT SUDDENLY AND THE TIRE EXPLODED!  THEY ALSO MOUNTED WEIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE MAGS WHEN THEY BALANCED THE TIRE, ONE WEIGHT WAS ACTUALLY DUG DOWN INTO THE RUBBER, ALSO, POSSIBLY CAUSING THE AIR LEAK.  WE HAD ALL VALVE STEMS REPLACED, ALL FOUR WERE CRACKED AND WE FOUND OUT THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY INSPECT THEM WAS TO REMOVE THE TIRE OFF THE RIM WHICH THE DEALERSHIP NEVER DID DO.  WE ARE OUT $275 FOR TWO TIRES, VALVE STEM REPLACEMENTS, BALANCING AND THE LABOR FOR ALL THIS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPAIRED AND HANDLED BY THE DEALERSHIP FOR FREE DUE TO THE RECALL......NOT TO MENTION THAT IF HE HAD FLIPPED THAT CAR AND GOTTEN KILLED WHAT WE WOULD BE FACING.  POOREST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN; DEALERSHIP SHOULD BE SHUTDOWN BY DMV FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS AND NOT PROPERLY HANDLING A RECALL NOTICE.  (WE HAD TO REPLACE TWO TIRES BECAUSE THEY HAVE 30,000 MILES ON THEM AND WE DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING JUST THING TO PUT ONE NEW TIRE ON THE CAR! *TR",

LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR I HAD ONLY 5,000 MILES ON IT AND MY TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR SYSTEM WENT OF ON A MILD SEPTEMBER DAY.  I PULLED OVER AT A GAS STATION LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM WHEN THE SENSOR LIGHT CAME ON AND FOUND THE LEFT REAR TIRE VALVE STEM WAS CRACKED AT THE BASE WHERE IT SEATS IN THE RIM.  I FILLED THE TIRE AND MADE IT ANOTHER BLOCK TO A TIRE REPAIR STORE, WHERE THEY REPLACED ACTUALLY TWO VALVE STEMS THAT WERE BAD.  I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND COMPLAINED.  I WAS TOLD TO CALL THE TIRE MANUFACTURER AS IF I WAS SOME DUMB WOMAN.  AS A WOMAN WORKING IN A MANS FIELD AS A MECHANIC I KNOW THAT TIRES DO NOT COME WITH VALVE STEMS TIRES COME AS TIRE AND I ARGUED THAT WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY FINALLY AGREED TO LOOK AT THE CAR, AND FOUND THAT THE TIRE GOING FLAT RUINED THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM BAND AND DAMAGED THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE.  THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR BAND AND ORDERED A REPLACEMENT TIRE FOR ME.  JUST A WEEK AGO WITH THE 13,000 MILES ON THE CAR I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN WITH THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR SYSTEM GOING OFF AND I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED THE VALVE STEMS AND FOUND ANOTHER VALVE STEM THAT WAS CRACKED APART.  I WENT BACK TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY QUESTION WHY IT WAS THE LEFT REAR TIRE AGAIN AS I REPLIED THAT I HAD MY TIRES ROTATED AND THEN THEY ASKED IF I HAD \"CURBED\" THE CAR OR TIRES.  I LAUGHED AND COMMENTED ON THE LACK OF SCUFF MARKS ON THE TIRES.  ONCE AGAIN THEY RELENTED AND REPLACED THE FAULTY VALVE STEM AT NO CHARGE.

ABOUT AN HOUR LATER HIS SECOND \"CALL OF DOOM\" TOLD ME THAT THE FLYWHEEL AND TRANS. WOULD ALSO NEED REPLACING.

THE LOW PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, AND I PULLED OVER ASAP TO INVESTIGATE.   2) THE DRIVER SIDE REAR TIRE WAS LOW.

IT WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE, SO I INSTALLED THE SPARE, AND DROVE TO A NEARBY SEARS TO REPAIR THE VALVE STEM.  3) I PAID $26 FOR A \"FLAT REPAIR\" - BASICALLY THEY REPLACED THE TIRE VALVE. I DO NOT HAVE THE OLD PART.  THE GOOD NEWS IS THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR TECHNOLOGY SAVED ME FROM HAVING A HIGH SPEED FLAT. I EXPECTED TO FIND A NAIL IN MY TIRE, NOT A FAULTY VALVE STEM.

        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2007 FORD GT V-8 AUTOMATIC MUSTANG ON 10/10/06.  ONE WEEK AFTER THE PURCHASE, I WAS DRIVING, AND MY THROTTLE GOT STUCK.  I PULLED THE E BRAKE AND THREW THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL. AFTER STOPPED THE CAR EVENTUALLY TURNED, I BELIEVE BECAUSE THE RPM'S WERE SO HIGH. ELEVEN DAYS LATER ON 10/29/06 I TOOK OFF AND THE GAS PEDAL STARTED TO TAKE CONTROL AGAIN, YET FAILED TO GO TO THE EXTREME AS THE FIRST TIME.  ON 11/07/06 APPROX 6:45 PM, I WAS DRIVING, GOING ABOUT 55 MPH. IT WAS ALREADY DARK OUTSIDE & ROADS WET. AFTER BEING SET ON A SPEED OF 50-55 MPH, I HIT THE GAS PEDAL TO GET UP TO AROUND 60 MPH. ONCE I DID, I COULD FEEL THE GAS PEDAL GO DOWN ON IT'S OWN. INSTINCT REACTION WAS TO HIT THE BRAKES, BUT WHEN I DID THE CAR STARTED SLIDING DUE TO THE WET ROAD. WHILE THE RPM'S WERE GOING UP, I THREW THE SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL AND PULLED THE E BRAKE. ONCE I FINALLY STOPPED, THE RPM'S WERE STILL EXTREME, AND THEN THE CAR FINALLY CUT OFF ON IT'S OWN.  I LEFT THE CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT EVENING. THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON ON 11/08/06, THE MECHANIC STATED THAT THE CAR WAS READY, SO I ASKED WHAT THEY HAD DETERMINED.  HE STATED THAT THE FLOOR MAT WAS THE ISSUE. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED TO ME, I DID NOT HAVE THE WEATHER MAT WHICH IS 5 CM THICK. IN ADDITION, HOW CAN A FLOOR MAT, MAKE A PEDAL ACCELERATE ON IT'S OWN? I COULD ACTUALLY FEEL THE GAS PEDAL GOING DOWN AS IF CRUISE CONTROL WAS JUST TURNED ON. THE DEALERSHIP ASKED IF HE COULD DRIVE MY CAR HOME TO HIS HOUSE TO DETERMINE THE ISSUE. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO PUT A FLIGHT DETECTOR ON THE CAR. I SPOKE WITH HIM ON 11/09/06; HE STATED THAT THE THROTTLE GOT STUCK ON HIM. HE STATED AGAIN THAT IT WAS A FLOOR MAT ISSUE.  HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE MY CAR FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, WITH OUT THE FLOOR MATS, TO SEE IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A FLOOR MAT CAN CAUSE SUCH A FATAL INCIDENT.   EITHER WAY, I HAVE A NEW CAR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE MY DREAM CAR AND I AM SCARED TO DEATH TO DRIVE IT!   *NM",
