MY FORD MUSTANG'S SEATBELTS DO NOT AND HAVE NOT WORKED PROPERLY SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE CAR; THEY WILL NOT RETRACT PROPERLY AND HANG UP, I AM CONSTANTLY HAVING MESS WITH THEM SO THEY CAN BE USED. I HAVE OWNED FOUR OTHER MUSTANGS (FOX AND SN95 CARS) AND THREE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS, I ALSO HAVE A FRIEND WITH A 2001 MUSTANG COBRA WHICH ALSO HAS DEFECTIVE SEATBELTS.  I PURCHASED MY CAR SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT ONLY HAD 36,000 MILES ON IT, THE CAR HAD BEEN GARAGE KEPT AND BABIED AS I HAVE DONE ALSO. MY CAR CURRENTLY HAS 70,000 MILES ON IT. I BELIEVE THE FAULTY SEATBELTS IN MY MUSTANG AND MY FRIEND'S COBRA COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO AN OCCUPANT IF INVOLVED IN A COLLISION. THIS PROBLEM IS OFTEN MENTIONED ON FORD MUSTANG FORUMS AND I HAVE QUESTIONED MY DEALER WHERE MY CAR IS REGULARLY SERVICE (MATHEWS FORD, IN NEWARK, OHIO). THIS PAST WINTER WHILE DRIVING THE CAR I HAD A DEER RUN OUT IN FRONT OF ME, I PUSHED THE BRAKES TO THE FLOOR WHICH CAUSED MY GIRLFRIEND TO ALMOST HIT THE DASH BECAUSE HER SEATBELT DID NOT OPERATE PROPERLY.  I AM ASKING THAT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY REPLACE THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE IN MY FORD MUSTANG, BOTH SEATBELTS ARE FAULTY WITH THE PASSENGER BELT BEING THE WORSE. I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS IN MY LIFE AND NEVER HAD FAULTY BELTS LIKE FORD MUSTANGS SEEM TO HAVE. I BELIEVE A REPUTABLE MANUFACTURE LIKE FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD REMEDY THE SITUATION AND NOT ALLOW MYSELF OR MY PASSENGERS TO RISK BODILY INJURY OR DEATH BECAUSE OF A MALFUNCTION ON MY SEATBELTS.

THIS OPTION WAS ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $3200.00. THIS OPTION HOWEVER ONLY INCLUDED 1 YR. WARRANTY ON THE SIDE THAT WOULD BE REPLACED. IN ADDITION, FORD WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SAME PROBLEM COULDN'T OCCUR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ENGINE OR TO ANOTHER SPARK PLUG.  2.) THE OTHER OPTION FORD RECOMMENDED WAS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE. THIS OPTION WOULD COST APPROX. $4565.00. THIS OPTION INCLUDED 3-YR OR 36,000 MILES OF WARRANTY ON THE ENGINE. THIS IS THE OPTION THAT I CHOSE.    PRIOR TO TAKING THE CAR OUT OF THE DEALER, I ASKED THE SERVICE TECHINITIAN IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT I COULD DO TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.
