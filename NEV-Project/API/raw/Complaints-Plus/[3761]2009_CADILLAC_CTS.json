WHEN I PULLED OVER TO PUT THE SPARE ON I DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO SPARE NO JACK NO LUG WRENCH.,.BUT JUST AN ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP AND A SEAL KIT IN THE WHEEL WELL.  LUCKILY I WAS ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME BUT MY POINT IS I COULD HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITH NOTHING  TO TEMPORARILY FIX/REPLACE THE BAD TIRE.  AFTER CONTACTING THE DEALER ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY THEY ORDERED A TIRE AND REPLACED IT.I QUESTIONED WHY NO SPARE AND THEY COULD NOT ANSWER,JUST SAID  \"THAT'S GM FOR YOU\"  THEY SAID THEY COULD ORDER A SPARE TIRE KIT FOR $340.00 WHICH I DID AND JUST REC'D TODAY.  WITH THAT BEING SAID,MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN THEY SELL A CAR WITHOUT A SPARE,JACK,LUG WRENCH??? EVERY NEW CAR I HAVE PURCHASED OVER THE LAST 30 PLUS YEARS HAS ALWAYS HAD A SPARE!!.ISN'T IT REQUIRED UNDER DOT REGS. *TR  THANK YOU",
