I CONTINUED TO ADD COOLANT, BUT COULD NEVER FIND THE LEAK. WHILE HAVING MY OIL CHANGED IN JUNE 2016, THE DEALER (WHERE VEHICLE  HAD BEEN PURCHASED AND SERVICED) SAID COOLANT HAD LEAKED INTO THE OIL DUE TO A CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD, AND ESTIMATED APPROX $3500 TO FIX IT.

IN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, I FOUND GM SERVICE BULLETIN #06-06-01-019B, 12 JUNE 2007, SUBJECT INFORMATION ON GRADUAL COOLANT LOSS OVER TIME WITH NO EVIDENCE OF LEAK FOUND. IT DISCUSSES A KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT WITH CASTECH HEADS USED IN THE 5.3L VORTEC ENGINE AS I HAVE IN MY TRUCK.  SUBSEQUENT ONLINE SEARCHES INDICATED THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG SUCH GM ENGINES.    I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER WITH THE SERVICE BULLETIN AND ASKED WHAT GM WOULD DO TO ASSIST IN THE REPAIR OF THIS KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  THE DEALER SAID THE VEHICLE WASN'T UNDER WARRANTY SO THEY WOULDN'T DO HELP.  I REQUESTED ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE GM REGIONAL REP, AND WAS ALSO TOLD THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  IN MARCH 2017, I WROTE A LETTER TO GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER REQUESTING ASSISTANCE. GM RESPONDED WITH A LETTER TWO WEEKS LATER STATING THAT FOR SERVICE REQUEST NUMBER 8-2815264552, THEY \"CANNOT PROVIDE ANY COST ASSISTANCE ON THE ENGINE ISSUE ON THE VEHICLE.\"  FURTHER THEY STATED THERE IS NO RECALL OR SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR THE ISSUE.    THE FAULTY CASTING OF THE CASTECH CYLINDER HEAD IN THE 5.3L VORTEC ENGINE IS A KNOWN DEFECT IN ABOUT 5 YEARS OF GM VEHICLES WHICH GM REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO CUSTOMERS, BUT CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGES THROUGH ITS SERVICE BULLETIN.  GM SHOULD PROVIDE A RECALL OR AT LEAST FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CORRECT THIS KNOWN DEFECT.",

I WAS HEADING TOWARD THE INTERSECTION, THE LIGHT WAS RED, WITH BUSY CROSS TRAFFIC.  THE STREET I WAS ON IS NARROW AND STEEP AND I BEGAN TO PICK UP SPEED.  I SHIFTED THE TRANS INTO THE LOWEST GEAR AND STEPPED ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  THE TRUCK FINALLY CAME TO A STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION, AS ONCOMING CARS LUCKILY AVOIDED HITTING ME.

LATER, UPON INSPECTION,  HE WAS CORRECT.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THAT YEAR.  HE REPLACED THE LINE AND I THOUGHT THAT HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM; UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO.  AGAIN, I AM DRIVING DOWN A HILL AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  I WAS TOWING A VERY LARGE TRAILER THIS TIME AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HAD LITTLE AFFECT.  LUCKILY, THERE WAS LITTLE TRAFFIC AND I WAS ABLE TO RIDE IT OUT WITHOUT INCIDENT.  I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH NOT ONLY THE 03 YEAR BUT 4 OR 5 YEARS PRIOR ALSO.  ANOTHER MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF LINES SHOULD BE REPLACED SINCE GM USED A UNCOATED STEEL WHICH BEGINS TO BE COMPROMISED WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS WHERE SALT IS HEAVILY USED IN THIS AREA.    IT IS OBVIOUS THAT GM USED UNCOATED STEEL INSTEAD OF COATED OR STAINLESS TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS.  HAD MY 17 YEAR OLD SON BEEN DRIVING,  THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.

UPON APPLYING MY BRAKES, THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED COMPLETELY WHEREBY THE BRAKE PEDAL LOST ALL PRESSURE AND DEPRESSED COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR.

LIMPED ALL THE WAY HOME IN THE BREAK DOWN LANE IN FIRST GEAR. CALLED A TOW TRUCK ($$$) THAT BROUGHT IT TO THE SHOP. THE SHOP REPLACED ($$$) A SECTION OF ROTTED BREAK LINE THAT FAILED. 2ND TIME: TODAY WITH BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS IN THE TRUCK, SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS ABOVE ONLY WITH A STOP SIGN AND I WAS GOING FASTER THAN I WANTED TO BE WHEN WE APPROACHED THE STOP SIGN (TRAFFIC ON THE MAIN ROAD DIDN'T HAVE TO STOP) SO BETWEEN DOWN SHIFTING, UP SHIFTING AND EMERGENCY BRAKE, I WAS ABLE TO TIME IT TO GO INTO TRAFFIC AND ONCE AGAIN LIMP ALL THE WAY HOME, PARKED THE TRUCK AND GO THROUGH MORE CRAP, AGGRAVATION AND $$$.  I'VE LIVED IN CONNECTICUT ALL MY (DRIVING) LIFE, OWNED DIFFERENT MAKES OF TRUCKS AND CARS (SOME FROM THE LATE 60'S ALL THE WAY THE PRESENT) AND NEVER, EVER HAD A BRAKE LINE BUST OR ROT THROUGH ON ANY OF THE VEHICLES IN THE 34 YEARS I'VE DRIVEN. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT GM DOESN'T HAVE REPLACEMENTS, THEY GOT RID OF THEM SO TESTS COULDN'T BE RUN ON THEM. I PAID ENOUGH FOR THE TRUCK TO EXPECT IT TO BE SAFE FOR MY FAMILY. I MEAN, REALLY, BRAKE LINES. MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM ON THE VEHICLE, THE BRAKE SYSTEM. THEY MAKE THE EXHAUST SYSTEM OUT OF STAINLESS. HERE'S A THOUGHT, STAINLESS BRAKE LINES.   *TR",

IN THIS CASE, I DO NOT KNOW IF THE PREMATURE RUSTING IS DUE TO POOR MATERIALS OR THE LOCATION OF THE LINES.  THE LEAK IS LOCATED WHERE THE LINES ARE MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE FRAME, IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT EDGE OF THE DRIVER'S DOOR. IN THIS LOCATION THEY APPEAR TO BE MORE EXPOSED TO SALT SPRAY COMING OFF OF THE FRONT WHEEL THEN THEY WOULD BE IF THEY WERE MOUNTED TO THE INSIDE WALL OF THE FRAME.

I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND WAS ABLE TO SLOW THE TRUCK DOWN. I PROCEEDED TO THE SCHOOL AT A VERY REDUCED SPEED USING THE PARKING BRAKE AND PUMPING THE BRAKES. I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY GET TO THE SCHOOL. I EXITED THE SCHOOL YARD AND PARKED THE TRUCK. CALLED A TOW TRUCK FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP.  THE MECHANIC THAT REPAIRED THE BRAKE LINES SAID THERE HAS BEEN A PARTIAL RECALL ON GMC AND CHEVROLET TRUCKS FOR FAULTY BRAKE LINES BUT MY TRUCK WAS NOT INCLUDED. HE SAID THE WORST RUST WAS AT THE ABS CONTROL BUT THERE WERE OTHER AREA'S INVOLVED ALSO. THIS VEHICLE IS ONLY 9 YEARS OLD. I HAVE OWNED VEHICLES MUCH OLDER THAN THIS ONE AND HAVE NEVER HAD A BRAKE LINE RUST THROUGH.   I URGE YOU TO DO A DEEPER STUDY AND RECALL IF NECESSARY, INTO WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE USE OF INFERIOR BRAKE LINES AND/ OR POOR PLACEMENT OF THE ABS CONTROL ON A WIDER RANGE OF THIS VEHICLE.

WHEN I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY NO HELP.  I WAS TOLD I DO NOT DRIVE IT ENOUGH AND THE FACT THAT THE TRUCK IS OLDER IT IS A PART OF LIFE.  THEY WOULD NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.   I WAS TOLD THAT THE NHTSA IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER WITH GM.  IF YOU NEED ANY HELP PLEASE CALL ME I WOULD GLADLY HELP IN THIS MATTER.  *TR",

I TOOK THE TRUCK TO GMC FOR SERVICE [OIL CHANGE] & THEY STATED THE REAR ROTORS WERE \"VERY RUSTY\". I ASKED THE SERVICEMAN WHAT TO DO & HE SAID EITHER I NEEDED TO HAVE THE ROTORS TURNED OR THE BRAKES WOULD WEAR OUT PREMATURELY.

I TALKED TO THE BBB AND THEY SAID WHEN I TOOK THE TRUCK IN IT HAD 48000 MILES ON IT & WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS SITUATION STARTED BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED BUT I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT. MY TRUCK IS A 2003 AND I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF IT [SERVICED REGULARLY AND GARAGE KEPT] AND THERE IS NO REASON THE BRAKES SHOULD HAVE RUSTED THIS WAY UNLESS INFERIOR PARTS OR WORKMANSHIP IS INVOLVED.

I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER. MILEAGE HAS BEEN APPROX 50/50 BETWEEN HIGHWAY AND CITY DRIVING. ON A RECENT TRIP FROM PRESCOTT AZ TO PHOENIX AZ, THE PASSENGER SIDE HUB ASSEMBLY FAILED ON 2003 GMC SIERRA PICKUP; 2500HD WITH DURAMAX DIESEL ENGINE. ONCE HUB ASSEMBLY FAILED, THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE BROKE AND BASICALLY ALLOWED FOR THE WHEEL TO BECOME DETACHED FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE HUB ASSEMBLY FAILED WITHOUT WARNING AND HAD IT FAILED APPROX 10-15 MILES EARLIER IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN PRESCOTT AZ AND PHEONIX AZ.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER I PURCHASED IT FROM; PEORIA PONTIAC GMC, PEORIA, AZ. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DIAGNOSED THE HUB ASSEMBLY FAILURE AND AXLE BREAKAGE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE DRIVER'S SIDE HUB ASSEMBLY; IT WAS ALSO BAD. I ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON IF THERE WAS SOME ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE THAT I COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM. THE RESPONSE WAS A DISCONCERTING NO; THIS JUST SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON SOME OF THE PICKUPS.  I HAVE PAID TO HAVE BOTH FRONT HUB ASSEMBLIES REPLACED AND THE PASSENGER AXLE; APPROX $2500.  MY BIGGER CONCERN IS FIRST THAT 65000 CITY & HIGHWAY MILES SEEMS PRETTY LOW FOR A FAILURE POINT OF SOMETHING SO CRITICAL AS THE STEERING AND CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. SECONDLY THAT THERE IS APPARENTLY NO FIX OR ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION OF HOW TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM ON THIS VEHICLE.   MY IMMEDIATE SUSPICION IS THAT GM INADEQUATE HUB ASSEMBLIES ON THEIR DIESEL PICKUPS AND ARE NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL STRESSES OF THE HEAVY WEIGHTS AND TORQUES, ETC. I WAS TRAVELING WITH MY ELDERLY PARENTS AND WE WERE LITERALLY LUCKY THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON A FLAT OPEN AREA OF ROAD AND I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO A SAFE STOP.  *JB",

THE PROBLEM WAS INITIALLY ISOLATED TO THE SPEEDOMETER, BUT NOW MY TACHOMETER IS NOW READING 800-2000 RPM HIGHER THAN ACTUAL AND THE AMP METER HAS ALSO STARTED TO READING HIGH. I CONTACTED A LOCAL GMC DEALERSHIP AND GOT AN ESTIMATE OF AROUND $600 DOLLARS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE TECHNICIAN I SPOKE TO AT THE GMC DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM GMC OWNERS BUT NO RECALL HAS BEEN INITIATED. I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND DISCUSSION FORUMS WHERE MANY OTHER GMC OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS.

EVENTUALLY THIS DELTA WILL GROW AND CAN ONLY BE REDUCED BY STARTING THE ENGINE REPEATEDLY. THE SPEED WILL GO DOWN BY A CONSTANT 5 MPH EACH TIME YOU RESTART BUT THIS WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO BURNING A STARTER.  THIS ALSO LEAVES THE DRIVER TO GUESS WHAT THE CORRECT DELTA IS.  THIS MORNING THE SPEEDOMETER CONTINUED TO CLIMB EVEN THOUGH I WAS GOING A CONSTANT 30 MPH ON A CITY STREET.  I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I WAS SPOKE A FRIEND THAT IS A COUNTY SHERIFF THAT WAS CLOCKING TRAFFIC AT THE TIME.   THE SPEEDOMETER CONTINUED TO CLIMB UP TO THE LIMIT SPEED OF 120 MPH WHILE I WAS STILL GOING 30 MPH.  THE SPEEDOMETER EVENTUALLY PASSED 120 MPH AND RESTED AT 245 DEGREES FROM THE 0 POSITION. THIS LEFT ME WITH ZERO SPEED INDICATION WHETHER IT BE A DELTA OR TRUE.  THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY EVENT AND I DIDN'T FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE THIS WAY.  AFTER I ARRIVED AT WORK I BEGAN SEARCHING THE WEB TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT I DID.  I HAVE FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM IN MANY GMC/CHEVROLET TRUCKS.  HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.NET/FORUM/AUTOS/CHEVROLET-TAHOE/T2BGKBGI55EKNU77C/P5 THIS WIDESPREAD PROBLEM MUST BE REVIEWED AND IN MY OPINION (I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER FOR A LARGE MANUFACTURER) THIS SHOULD BE FIXED BY THE COMPANY AT FAULT WHICH IS GM.  THIS VEHICLE WILL BE PARKED ONCE I GET IT HOME AND I WILL DRIVE A DIFFERENT VEHICLE BECAUSE THIS LOSS OF A BASIC SAFETY INDICATION CAN BE DEVASTATING TO NOT ONLY MYSELF AND FAMILY, BUT TO ALL MOTORISTS.  MANY PEOPLE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SECOND VEHICLE AND THEREFORE PLAN ON CONTINUED USE OF THE FAULTY VEHICLE.  THIS CONTINUED OPERATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO SAFETY AND SHOULD BE FIXED.  I WAS QUOTED A PRICE OF $2000 THIS MORNING TO FIX THIS SAFETY ISSUE ON A 3 YEAR OLD TRUCK. *NM",
