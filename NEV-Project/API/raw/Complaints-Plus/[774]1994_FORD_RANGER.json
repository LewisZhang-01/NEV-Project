THE RIMS AND TIRES WERE INSTALLED ON A 1996 FORD RANGER 2WD INITIALLY AND THEN ON MY 1994 FORD RANGER XLT 2WD.  FRONT TWO TIRES BEGAN TO FEEL WOBBLY AND VIBRATE EXCESSIVELY.

THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS CAUSE OF THE VIBRATION.  TIRES REPLACED AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  THE REPLACEMENT TIRES WERE PUT ON THE REAR AND THE TWO REMAINING FUZION TIRES WERE MOVED TO THE FRONT.  A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, ONE OF THE FUZION TIRES NOW ON THE FRONT REPEATED THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE OTHER TWO.

SUBJECT: IGNITION MODULE SAFETY COMPLAINT.  6 OUT OF 7 BAD  COMMENTS: PROBLEM: 1994 FORD RANGER PICKUP DIES FREQUENTLY AND SPORADICALLY AFTER IGNITION MODULE REPLACEMENT BY AUTO MECHANIC. FIRST 2 OEM MODULES FROM ADVANCE AUTO TEST BAD AT PARTS DEALER. THIRD MODULE IS FORD MOTOR CRAFT AND IS ASSUMED GOOD. SEVERAL NEW PARTS INSTALLED INCLUDING CRANK SENSOR, FUEL FILTER, FUEL RELAY, TIMING BELT, EEC (COMPUTER), WATER PUMP, EEC RELAY. SPORADIC DYING CONTINUES. FORD MODULE TESTED AT AUTO ZONE AND FAILS, BUT NEW AUTO ZONE DURALAST MODULE IS TESTED FOR COMPARISON AND PASSES. MECHANIC RETURNS MODULE AND ORDERS NEW ONE FROM ADVANCE AUTO. IT FAILS TEST IN STORE. MECHANIC ORDERS ANOTHER THAT PASSES AT ADVANCE BUT FAILS AT AUTO ZONE ON DURALAST TEST. I INSTALL MODULE AND IT FAILS A QUARTER MILE FROM HOUSE. MECHANIC GETS ANOTHER MOTOR CRAFT MODULE FROM FORD THAT PASSES AT ADVANCE AND FAILS AT AUTO ZONE. I DON'T INSTALL IT. THAT MAKES 4 OEM MODULES THAT FAILED AND 2 MOTOR CRAFT. FINALLY, I INSTALL AUTO ZONE MODULE THAT PASSED TEST AT AUTO ZONE. NO FAILURE FOR 4 DAYS AND COUNTING. LOCAL FORD DEALER TRIED TWICE TO FIND THE PROBLEM AFTER THE FIRST MOTOR CRAFT MODULE WAS INSTALLED AND DID NOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM. THEY DID NOT HAVE AN OUT OF VEHICLE ANALYZER. MY CONCLUSION: THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL ENCOUNTER THE SAME PROBLEM. MY VEHICLE DIED ON THE ORDER OF SEVERAL DOZEN TIMES OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD (ALMOST DAILY). LUCKILY I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA AND AM QUICK AT HITTING THE EMERGENCY BLINKER. AFTER AWHILE,I BOUGHT A USED CAR AND ONLY DROVE THE TRUCK TO TEST IT. SAFETY HAZARD: UNEXPECTED DYING ON BUSY HIGHWAY OR AT INTERSECTION COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT YOUR DOING SOMETHING. FORD WON'T.  *TR",

DURING MOST OF THE LIFE OF MY WILDERNESS AT TIRES I WAS LIVING IN BISHOP, CA AND YUCCA VALLEY, CA, WHICH ARE BOTH HOT DESERT CLIMATES, WHICH I UNDERSTAND ARE WHERE MOST OF THE OTHER TREAD SEPARATIONS HAVE OCCURRED.  THE TREAD SEPARATION OCCURRED ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE AS I WAS TRAVELING DOWN A HILL ON HWY 62 FROM YUCCA VALLEY TO PALM SPRINGS, CA.  I BARELY KEPT CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SIMPLY A FLAT TIRE, BUT THE TIRE PEOPLE SAID THEY COULD NOT REPAIR IT BECAUSE THE TREAD HAD SEPARATED, AND THEY SHOWED ME A LARGE BUBBLED UP AREA OF THE TIRE.  BECAUSE I HAD HEARD OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH WILDERNESS AT TIRES INVOLVING FATALITIES, I OPTED TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES (THOUGH I STILL HAVE A WILDERNESS AT UNDER THE TRUCK AS A SPARE).  I REPLACED THEM WITH BRIDGESTONE DUELLERS BECAUSE THEY HAD A BETTER REPUTATION FOR QUALITY, AND I HAD HEARD AT THE TIME THAT THE REPLACEMENT TIRES FOR THE FAULTY WILDERNESS AT'S SHOULD BE THROUGHT FIRESTONE OR BRIDGESTONE.  WHEN THE RECALL BECAME OFFICIAL, I OBTAINED A LETTER FROM THE TIRE PLACE NOTING THE TIRE SEPARATION SO THAT I COULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE FAILED TIRES.  SHORTLY AFTER OBTAINING THE LETTER, NOT KNOWING WHERE TO SEND IT, MY JOB TRANSFERRED ME TO CHEYENNE WYOMING, AND I ONLY RECENTLY RELOCATED THE LETTER, AS WELL AS LEARNED THAT THE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT I PURCHASED WERE OFFICIALLY DEEMED AS FAULTY AND UNSAFE.  I WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE INJURY, BUT I ATTRIBUTE THAT TO MY EXCELLENT DRIVING SKILLS - THE TIRES TRULY CREATED AN UNSAFE SITUATION FOR ME.*AK",

PRIOR TO THE TRIP  FROM SALT LAKE CITY TO CANADA, I WROTE A LETTER TO THE V.P OF CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS AND SATISFACTION EXPLAINING THE DANGER OF THE SAME COMPONENT FAILURE IF ONE WERE TRAVELING ON A REMOTE HIGHWAY IN A COLD ENVIRONMENT.

I ONLY THANK GOD FOR LOOKING DOWN ON ME AT THAT MOMENT.  AFTER NEARLY CRASHING, I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT OVER TWO LANES AND FINALLY COME TO A STOP.  WHEN I INSPECTED THE TIRE, I HAD FOUND IT COMPLETELY SEPERATED IN ONE WHOLE PIECE.  AFTER REMOVING THE TIRE, I HAD TO LITERALLY UNRAP THE WHOLE TREAD THAT HAD RAPPED AROUND MY TIE ROD END, AND KICK THE OTHER PORTION THAT WAS JAMMED IN BY BRAKE. I HAVE WORKED ON AIRPLANES I  N THE USAF FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS AND NEVER ONCE EXPERIENCED A TIRE THAT BADLY MUTILATED.  IT APPEARED TO BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF HOW CAN I MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION?  I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS IN AVIATION, AND I SEE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS ALL THE TIME.  I HAVE A BACHELORS IN PROFESSIONAL AERONAUTICS, WITH A MINOR IN AVIATION SAFETY.  I THINK YOU GUYS ARE MAKING A SERIOUS MISTAKE BY ONLY RECALLING ATX P35/75 R15S.  THERE IS AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM WITH MORE ATX TIRES. THE QUESTION IS, HOW MANY LIVES WILL IT TAKE BEFORE MORE TIRE SIZES ARE RECALLED.  REMINDS ME OF THE \"BLOOD PRIORITY\". I WILL BE TAKING PICTURES TOMORROW OF THE DAMAGED TIRE AND THE WHOLE TREAD THAT WAS SEPERATED.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE PICTURES, I WILL GLADLY SEND THEM.

I WAS TOLD THAT THE BEST WAY TO NOT LET THE BUILD UP GET SO BAD IS TO CLEAN IT OUT AS SOON AS THE WHIRRING NOISE STARTS WHEN YOU TURN ON THE FAN/AIR CONDITIONING.  THE BUILD UP OF DEBRIS IN SUCH A SMALL COMPARTMENT CAUSES THE DEBRIS TO BECOME VERY DRY AND COULD CAUSE A FIRE.    ALSO, THE O2 SENSOR!

A SIMPLE DIAGNOSTIC TEST CONFIRMED MY O2 PROBLEM, ONLY AFTER THE DEALER FAILED TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD COME ON, CAUSING PANIC (ON A LONG DRIVE, BY YOURSELF), MONEY SPENT TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM DUE TO INEPTNESS AT JOE MYERS, AND THEN EXTREMELY POOR GAS MILEAGE, AND POOR IN-TOWN PERFORMANCE.
