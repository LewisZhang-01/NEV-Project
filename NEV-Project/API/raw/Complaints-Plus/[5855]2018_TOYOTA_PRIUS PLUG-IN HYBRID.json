THE PIECE DID PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE WINDSHIELD AND IT SPIDERED OUT IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, LARGER THAN A QUARTER.   MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE BEEN IN OTHER VEHICLES AND HAD DEBRIS HIT THE WINDSHIELD THE SAME SITUATION THAT IS LARGER AND JUST BARLEY PUT A NICK IN THE WINDSHIELD.  IVE READ ON COMPLAINTS ABOUT 16' AND 17' MODELS HAVING THIS ISSUE AS WELL AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE TOYOTA IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.  I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF MY WINDSHIELD.",
