        "summary": "3 DAYS AFTER I PUT THE DOWN PAYMENT ON THE CAR, THE BRAKES WENT TO THE FLOOR.  I WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY, SO THEY FIXED THE CAR .  I MISSED WORK BECAUSE OF THAT SO I WAS ON PROBATION AT WORK.  SO A FEW DAYS LATER I GOT THE CAR BACK. NOW, TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT  BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE VEHICLE BACK A REPAIR SHOP.  WHAT THEY DID WAS WHEN THEY SERVICED THE CAR BEFORE I BROUGHT IT, THEY CHANGED THE OIL OF THE CAR AND DIDN'T PUT THE DRAIN PLUG BACK IN PROPERLY. SO IT CAME OUT WHICH CAUSED THE CAR TO SHUT DOWN AND THE ENGINE TO BLOW. SO I WAS OUT OF A CAR FOR 4 DAYS. ALREADY ON PROBATION AT WORK, I TOLD THEM THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET ME ANOTHER CAR OR I WAS GOING TO LOOSE MY JOB. THIS GUY NAMED DAVE THAT WORKS AT DRIVETIME TOLD ME WELL JUST FIND ANOTHER JOB. THAT WAS REALLY INCONSIDERATE.  I GOT SOMEONE TO GET ME A RENTAL THAT WAS 21.  THE CAR THAT IM PAYING ON WAS READY ON AUGUST 4.  BUT I DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL SATURDAY WHEN ENTERPRISE WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE.  DRIVETIME CUT THE RENTAL OFF ON THE 4TH.  DRIVETIME DIDN'T CONTACT ME TO INFORM ME THAT MY CAR WAS READY FOR PICK UP AT ALL.  SO WHEN THEY CUT OFF THE RENTAL I WAS CHARGED FOR THE 5,6,AND 7. WHICH IS THE AN ESTIMATE OF $180.00. I ASK TONY THAT WORK AT THE 103RD SERVICE CENTER \"WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS CALL ME?\" OBVIOUSLY, HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CAUSE HE REALLY TOOK OFFENSE TO IT.  AND SAID ITS NOW BETWEEN YOU AND ENTERPRISE.  THEY REFUSE TO TAKE ANY FAULT IN NOT CONTACTING AND THROWING A BILL LIKE THAT ON ME.  I FEEL THAT THEY DID IT PURPOSELY AND I WANT EVERYBODY OUT TO KNOW NOT TO EVER BUT A CAR FROM DRIVETIME! I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE JUST GETTING OVER ON ME BECAUSE IM A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.  BUT THEY ARE WRONG I JUST NEED SOMEONE TO SUPPORT ME AND MY VOICE TO BE HEARD. THAT'S WHY I WROTE YOU GUYS.........SO KEEP IT PUMPING, PUMPING, PUMPING.....PLEASE GET MY VOICE HEARD.  904-374-6512.  *NM",
