THE GROMMET FAILED PROBABLY DUE TO AGE, AND THE TRANSMISSION DESTROYS THE OVERDRIVE PORTION OF ITS SELF LEAVING THE DRIVER ONLY ABLE TO GO APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH IN OVERDRIVE POSITION AND ANYTHING OVER THE SHIFTING SPEED INTO OVERDRIVE JUST LETS THE ENGINE RPM RUN AWAY AND THE TRANSMISSION TO SLIP.  THE REAL PROBLEM THEN OCCURS IF THE DRIVER USES THE DRIVE POSITION TO GET THE VEHICLE BACK TO HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND NO SLIPPING OF THE TRANSMISSION. IF THE ACCELERATOR IS PUSHED CLOSE TO THE FLOOR, IT ALLOWS THE NOW FLOATING FREE KICK DOWN CABLE TO JAM THE THROTTLE TO FULL OPEN CAUSING A STUCK ACCELERATOR AND THE ONLY WAY TO FREE IT IS TO GET TO NEUTRAL QUICKLY AND TURN OFF IGNITION SWITCH, THEN UNJAM THE CABLE AND THROTTLE LINKAGE BY HAND. POSSIBLE ACCIDENTS/INJURIES OR DEATHS COULD RESULT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS FROM A STANDING STOP AT AN INTERSECTION, OR IN MY CASE, A HOUSING 25 MPH RESIDENTIAL ZONE.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS TO BE REBUILT AND THE GROMMET KICK DOWN CABLE GROMMET REPLACED. THE OLD GROMMET ON MY VEHICLE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.

CONSEQUENTLY, THEY DON'T OFFER A FIX EITHER, BUT I'VE DISCOVERED A KERNEL OF TRUTH THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT WHILE LOOKING AT MUSTANG ACCIDENT FIRES ON THE INTERNET.  I DIDN'T FIND MORE THAN A DOZEN REAL EXAMPLES AND ONLY FOUND A FEW PICTURES OF THE BURNT MUSTANGS AND ACTUAL ARTICLES OF SPECIFIC DEAD VICTIMS BUT THE FIRES WERE HORRIBLE AND SOME DIED WHILE OTHERS LIVED WITH SEVERE GASOLINE BURNS ALL OVER THEIR BODIES.  THE 79-93 MUSTANGS LIKE MY 93 MUSTANG HAVE GONE UP IN FLAMES WHEN REAR ENDED AT SPEEDS UNDER 50 MPH AND HAVE LEAKED FUEL WHEN HIT UNDER 30 MPH. IRONICALLY, IT APPEARS THAT THE 79-93 MUSTANG IS MORE LIKELY TO GO UP IN FLAMES THAN THE 92-2001 CROWN VICTORIA BECAUSE IT IS MUCH LIGHTER AND FLIMSIER THAN THE FULL FRAMED CROWN VIC WITH ITS HUGE FULL SIZE TRUNK.  THE MUSTANG GAS TANK IS ONLY A FEW INCHES FROM THE BUMPER, AND IT'S SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE REAR AXLE AND THE ACTUAL SHEET METAL OF THE MUSTANG BODY.  IT'S ACTUALLY LESS THAN AN INCH FROM THE SHEET METAL IN THE BACK AND ONLY A FEW INCHES FROM THE AXLE IN THE FRONT.   I'VE HAD TWO FAST-SPILLING FUEL LEAKS TWICE IN SIX MONTHS WITHOUT EVER BEING REAR ENDED.  I'VE OBSERVED THAT THE GAS CAN MIGRATE UNDER THE TANK WHERE THE LEAK IS AND EVEN CLIMB UP THE SIDES OF THE TANK AND ANY METAL IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH.  FROM THIS OBSERVATION, I UNDERSTAND IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE GASOLINE TO IGNITE IF IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH A SPARK UNDER THE CAR OR THE HEAT FROM THE EXHAUST PIPE.  I UNDERSTAND THE 93 MUSTANG IS VERY LIKELY TO SPILL GAS WHEN HIT OVER 30 MPH, AND IT CAN ALSO SPILL GAS WHEN HIT AT LOWER SPEEDS, BASED ON TESTS AVAILABLE FROM THE NHTSA.  I WISH FORD WITH COME OUT WITH A STRONGER SMALLER SAFETY GAS TANK TO REPLACE THE STANDARD 15 GALLON TANK WOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND SUCH COLLISIONS AND WOULD NOT LEAK FUEL FROM THE FILLER PIPE.   *JB",
