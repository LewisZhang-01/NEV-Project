        "summary": "I was informed by my mechanic that my steering column shaft needs to be replaced on my 2004 primary vehicle.  Ford says they do not have a recall and will not cover the service.   I have a recall for THE SAME ISSUE for my (not currently driving) 2005 Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor made in the SAME LOCATION (St. Thomas).  2005 Manufacturer Recall Number 13S08, NHTSA Recall Number 13V385000).    The recall includes cars originally sold in NH (both of mine) and says: SEVERE CORROSION CAN SEIZE THE LOWER INTERMEDIATE SHAFT WHICH MAY CAUSE THE UPPER INTERMEDIATE SHAFT TO COLLAPSE AND THE STEERING COLUMN LOWER BEARING TO SEPARATE.  Safety Risk: IF THE LOWER BEARING SEPARATES, THE VEHICLE MAY EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF STEERING, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  How can Ford say there is no issue when there is an active recall for it on model years 2005-2011?   Have there been reported issues/crashes of 2004 cars with this defect?    Is there anything I can do to have Ford cover this?  Or are they not bothering because there probably aren't many 2004s still on the road?   Is it possible to get Ford to provide the manufacturer lot/date codes of the defective steering parts?  As my 2004 & 2005 were built in the same location, I would bet my 2004 was built with the same steering part manufacturer lot as my 2005-  they probably don't turn out the volume of police Interceptors as commercial cars.

I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS THAT THIS IN AN IMMEDIATE SAFETY CONCERN AND FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  I WAS ADVISED BY FORD THAT THEY SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AT MY DEALERSHIP AND VERIFIED THAT MY CAR IS INDEED HAVING ISSUES THAT ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE RECALL INCLUDED.

THIS WAS THE FOURTH OCCURRENCE OF THE SAME PROBLEM, THREE WHILE I WAS DRIVING, ONCE WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING, DATING BACK TO NOVEMBER, 2010.  WE WERE INFORMED, BY THE ONE REPAIRING THE BODY, THAT HE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN DRIVING OUR VEHICLE INTO HIS SHOP. HE CAN VERIFY THIS OCCURRENCE.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, AND IT HAS ALREADY CAUSED CONSIDERABLE STRESS AND ANGST FOR BOTH OF US. THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE MOST SEVERE.

I HAVE RESEARCHED SEVERAL PLACES AND IT APPEARS THAT IT IS A FAULTY RELAY IN THE LIGHT CONTROL MODULE. I ALSO FOUND THAT IN FORD'S INFINITE WISDOM THAT YOU CANNOT JUST REPLACE THIS $4 RELAY INSIDE THE MODULE, YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE $500 MODULE.
