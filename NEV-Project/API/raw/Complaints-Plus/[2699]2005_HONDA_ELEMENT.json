I RECEIVED THREE EMAILS, AND ONE VOICEMAIL, TO REMIND ME OF THE APPOINTMENT. 43 MINUTES AFTER I BROUGHT THE CAR, THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE NEW AIRBAG. I GOT THEM TO PROVIDE ME WITH A RENTAL CAR. THEY OFFERED NO TIME-FRAME FOR WHEN THE PART WILL ARRIVE OR WHEN I WILL GET MY ELEMENT BACK.  [XXX], HOW CAN YOU GET TO 100% RECALL COMPLETION RATES IF YOU CANNOT PROVIDE THE REPLACEMENT PART?  TO QUOTE YOU FROM THE ABOVE STATEMENT, \"COMPLETION RATES OF ABOUT 33 PERCENT IN THE 9TH AND 10TH YEAR OF OWNERSHIP. TO AMPLIFY THIS POINT, LET ME EXPLAIN THAT WE HAVE ENLISTED A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FIRM AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO CONTACT HARD-TO-REACH OWNERS OF OLDER MODEL VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THE TAKATA AIRBAG INFLATOR RECALL. ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE INVESTIGATORS SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING THE OWNER, BUT DESPITE BEST EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THEM, THE CUSTOMER REFUSED TO BRING IN THEIR CAR FOR REPAIR.\"  I BROUGHT YOU MY CAR SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE START OF RECALL.

HE CALLED HIS TRANSMISSION CONTACT WHO IMMEDIATLY CONFIRMED THAT THE PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON FOR THE HONDA 4WD AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL BECAUSE HIS BUSINESS HAS FIXED MANY OF THESE 'UNSAFE' GEAR BOXES THAT TRANSER POWER TO THE REAR WHEELS.

I CONTACTED MY DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WAS MY PROBLEM--BUT IVE DONE MORE RESEARCH ONLY TO FIND THAT HONDA HAS SENT TSB'S OUT TO MANY DEALERS ADVISING THEM TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR THE 2003-2004 MODELS.
