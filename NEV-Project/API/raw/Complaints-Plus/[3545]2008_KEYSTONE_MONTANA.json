THE RV WAS BEING TRANSPORTED AT THE TIME OF THE LOSS AND WAS DEEMED ROAD-WORTHY BY A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT PRIOR TO THE LOSS. THE TIRE COULD HAVE FAILED DUE TO MANY UNKNOWN VARIABLES, ALL OF WHICH ARE COVERED UNDER MY POLICY. IF THE TIRE SIMPLY FAILED DURING TRANSPORT, THEY MIGHT NOT COVER THE TIRE, BUT THE ENSUING DAMAGE WOULD BE COVERED. SUCH PROBABILITIES AS POTHOLES, DEBRIS, OR OTHER CONDITIONS WOULD REQUIRE GEICO TO COVER THE TIRE AND THE ENSUING DAMAGE. EITHER WAY, THE REFUSAL TO COVER THE INCIDENT IN TRANSPORT IS NOT LEGAL. GEICO CLAIMS A TIRE WAS NOT MAINTAINED. THE TIRES ARE 4 YEARS OLD, HAS LESS THAN LESS THAN 1500 MILES ON THEM, HIGHLY MAINTAINED SINCE PURCHASE 09-07-16, THE DATE TIRES WERE PURCHASED, WITH ONLY 2 TIRES ON THE SAME SIDE HAVING ISSUES OUT OF 4 TIRES.
