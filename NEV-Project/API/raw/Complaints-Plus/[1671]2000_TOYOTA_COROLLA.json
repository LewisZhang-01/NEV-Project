IN SEPTEMBER 2003, I BROUGHT IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC, WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE CHARCOAL CANISTER (ADJACENT TO THE FUEL TANK, PART OF THE FUEL SYSTEM, USED TO GAUGE FUEL VAPORS) NEEDED REPLACEMENT, SINCE SOME GAS SPILLED INTO IT.  THE JOB WAS DONE (~$300), BUT THE LIGHT CAME BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN JUNE 2004, BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T PASS INSPECTION WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON.

FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRES I HAVE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS SOON?  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN, THANK YOU.( DOT NUMBER: BM13571-4 TIRE SIZE: P265/75R15 )",
