Since I was on an incline in the tunnel with no way to pull over and the vehicle was going forward at a snail's  pace, I decided to continue as far as I could since it was the safest thing to do for all drivers in the tunnel. The Expedition finally crept out of the tunnel and I was able to pull off to the side to let traffic pass. As soon as we had cell phone service, I had my daughter call the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel to let them know that we were disabled and in need of assistance.   I decided to see what would happen if I turned the vehicle off and restarted. Everything reset and I had power, but for how long? The CBBT police agreed that the safest course of action for all vehicles on the road was to tow my vehicle to the other side as it is dangerous to breakdown on the CBBT, especially in one of the tunnels. I was able to drive home after the tow.  However, the following day, I tried to drive it again and it did the same: ran rough, wrench sign, no pop that time, total loss of acceleration. Restarted and made it back home. My husband tested it a few days later after re-cleaning battery cable terminals that had been corroded before we replaced the factory battery, and it did the same thing with him on the highway!  If we had been trying to get into traffic, turn where we had to cross traffic or any number of other situations and the Expedition lost power like that, the outcome could be deadly.

Other motorists were visibly angry and honking at me.  After a little time I tried putting the vehicle in park, shutting it off and tried starting it again.  It started with no issue and then died again a few blocks later, fortunately that time it was in a better location with no traffic.  I took the vehicle to a Ford dealer the following morning, where I already had an appointment for preventative maintenance including new coolant and spark plugs.  I suspected the throttle body failed after researching the issue and found a history of similar problems with other Ford products.  The dealership also diagnosed a throttle body failure and charged me for a repair, which involved replacing the throttle body assembly.  It is my understanding that Ford has extended warranty coverage on other models and that there may have been a recall campaign involving other models.  My 2017 Ford Expedition XLT appears to have had the same issue.  This problem could have been EXTREMELY dangerous if it happened on the highway or if a less experienced driver was operating the vehicle.  The failure was sudden and unexpected.",

This factory lug nut is a 2-part assembly and swells over time to the point where a standard and factory supplied socket on the vehicle would not work properly if there was a situation where the tire needed to be changed .ie.. a flat on the side of the highway. This vehicle is less than 5 yrs. old... I purchased a complete new set of 24 lug nuts before leaving.

WE PULLED UP TO PARK BY HIS HOUSE ON A STEEP ROAD.  HE PUT THE VEHICLE INTO PARK, APPLIED THE PARKING BRAKE, REMOVED THE KEYS, AND PROCEEDED TO GET OUT.  THERE WERE THREE ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN (AGES 7 AND 4).  ALL THREE ADULTS GOT OUT AND WERE HELPING THE CHILDREN OUT WHEN THE CAR ROLLED FORWARD ON ITS OWN.

MY SON WHO WAS OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE ALSO REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING, JUMPED BACK IN, AND APPLIED THE BRAKES TO STOP THE CAR.  IT ROLLED ABOUT 12 FEET DOWNHILL BEFORE HE COULD STOP IT.  THE TWO CHILDREN WERE STILL IN IT.  THE STREET WAS ON A VERY STEEP INCLINE THAT I WOULD GUESS TO BE ABOUT 25 DEGREES.  IF MY SON HAD NOT STOPPED THE CAR IT COULD HAVE ROLLED ABOUT 100 YARDS THROUGH TWO INTERSECTIONS AND INTO A HOUSE WITH THE TWO CHILDREN IN IT.
