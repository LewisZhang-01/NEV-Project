We took it to a repair shop after the first instance and they told us the battery had died, though they were able to charge it and it restarted fine.  They could not find any other issues.  We continued to drive it and two days later the car died at another intersection just after my wife had picked up our kids from school.  We had it towed to the dealer this time.  I relayed the recall information for an earlier or different model of my car that sounded like the same issue: the starter motor fuse.  I believe this to be the same issue even though my car did not show up on the recall.",
