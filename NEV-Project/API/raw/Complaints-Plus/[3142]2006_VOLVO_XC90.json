The vehicle will shut off, as if the key has been turned off. But it hasn't been touched.  Steering becomes difficult and I have to try and get off the road.  Once I get pulled over and put it in park, it will start and run normally for a time. It most often happens when i turn to the right fairly tight. But not exclusively.  Today after driving it approximately 120 miles with one shut off, my check engine light came on and it was difficult to get started again.  This is absolutely a Hazzard to others and myself",

As you  can imagine  this gets very uncomfortable and feels like i am getting choked to death. I will set it back  and it will keep doing that . I will hear clicking and then it will start moving. sometimes. i will have to hold my finger on the down button to keep it from moving on me while im driving, sometimes it will still move all the way up while i am holding the button down. and then it will get all the way forward and the buttons will not work for me for a while. Im stuck in the forward  up position choking and cant do anything about it. Eventually they will start working again nut its a very impossible position to be left in.   I don't know why it is doing this. I feel like  I have a Christine car(from the movie)  .      I haven't taken it anywhere and not sure where to go.
