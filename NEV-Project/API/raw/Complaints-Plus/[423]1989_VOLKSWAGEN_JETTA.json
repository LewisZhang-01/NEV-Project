THE NHTSA WEBSITE REPORTS THAT THERE WAS A RECALL OF 1989 JET'S FOR THEIR HEATER CORE.  I CONTACTED WES GREENWAY'S ALEXANDRIA VOLKSWAGEN TO HAVE THE WORK DONE.  I DID SO THROUGH AN ONLINE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE COMPANY, IN WHICH I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SITE, MR. TONY HUYNH, IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL INVOLVING HEATER CORES FOR 1989 JET'S.  WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD SEEN THAT THERE WAS ONE, THROUGH A WEBSITE, HE CHECKED MY VIN ON HIS COMPUTER AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO \"OPEN RECALL\" ON MY SPECIFIC CAR.  I WENT TO MY OFFICE AND FOUND THE NHTSA NOTICE AND CALLED MR. HUYNH, SO THAT I COULD LET HIM KNOW THAT I FOUND THE RECALL ON AN OFFICIAL SITE, NOT SOMETHING UNOFFICIAL AS HE HAD SUGGESTED WHEN I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP (AT WHICH POINT I COULD NOT RECALL THE WEB SOURCE FOR MY INFORMATION).  HE CONTINUED TO DENY THERE WAS A RECALL.  IN BOTH INSTANCES, HE SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, AND HE GAVE ME AN 800-NUMBER TO CALL.  (INCIDENTALLY, WHEN I WAS AT THE VW DEALER, MR. HUYNH SAID I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR AN APPOINTMENT RATHER THAN USING THE WEBSITE.  I SUGGESTED TO MR. HUYNH THAT THE WEBSITE SHOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CALL IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM.  HE SAID THE WEBSITE INSTRUCTED PEOPLE TO CALL IF THEY HAD COMPLEX PROBLEMS.  I WENT BACK TO THE GREENWAY VW WEBSITE AND FOUND NO SUCH INSTRUCTION AND HAVE PRINTED OUT THE RELEVANT WEBPAGES.)  THANKS FOR ANY ASSISTANCE WITH THIS ISSUE.  *LA",

VOLKSWAGEN USA CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE BUT DIERCK'S SEES SEVERAL EACH TIME IT GETS COLD.

TEMPORARY FIX CONSISTS OF DISCONNECTING WARM AIR INTAKE IN COLD WEATHER AND PLUGGING PORTS.HOWEVER, THIS LEADS TO SOME EXHAUST COMING OFF THE ENGINE AND INTO PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. VERY PREDICTABLE PROBLEM AND PREVENTABLE IF VOLKSWAGEN WOULD PROVIDE FIX-IT KIT.  DIERCK'S REPAIR IS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEM (ASK FOR BARD).  SUMMER DRIVING IS FINE.

THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.
