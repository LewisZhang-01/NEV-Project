        "summary": "2014 I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM PAUL MILLER ROLLS ROYCE IN NEW JERSEY.    2016 THE RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW FRACTURED ON ITS OWN. NOT CAUSED BY IMPACT. PAUL MILLER REPLACED WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY.    2017 THE RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW FRACTURED AGAIN ON ITS OWN. NOT CAUSED BY IMPACT. PAUL MILLER REPLACED THE WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY.    2019 I MOVED TO MIAMI BEACH, FL WITH THE VEHICLE.    2021 THE RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW FRACTURED AGAIN ON ITS OWN. NOT CAUSED BY IMPACT. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO BRAMAN MIAMI ROLLS ROYCE. THEY DECLINED TO REPLACE THE WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY.     RICKY WILDNER FROM BRAMAN STATED THAT THE LOCAL ROLLS ROYCE REPRESENTATIVE OFFERED A DISCOUNTED PRICE OF $5500 TO REPLACE THE WINDOW. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE FRACTURE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY STORAGE IN FLORIDA HEAT.     MATTHEW BOYER FROM BRAMAN STATED THAT HE FORMERLY WORKED FOR ROLL ROYCE MOTOR CAR AND THIS PROBLEM HAS NEVER OCCURED IN THIS MODEL.    REPLACING THE WINDOW WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS FUTILE.    CONSIDERING THAT THE SAME WINDOW HAS BROKEN IN THE IDENTICAL MANNER 3 TIMES WITH NO IMPACT, EVEN IF I PAY TO REPLACE THE WINDOW, IT WILL LIKELY FRACTURE IN THE SAME MANNER AGAIN.    I BELIEVE THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT THE DEFECT THAT CAUSED THE WINDOW TO FRACTURE IN SAME MANNER 3 TIMES IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD. IT IS LIKELY THAT MY CONTINUING TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE DAILY WITH THE FRACTURED WINDOW IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD.",
