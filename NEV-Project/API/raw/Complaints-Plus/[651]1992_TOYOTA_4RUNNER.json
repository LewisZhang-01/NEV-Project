I WATCHED THE TACHOMETER GO FROM 1.1K RPM TO 4K RPM WITHOUT TOUCHING THE ACCELERATOR. THIS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN OVER A 1/2 MILE STRETCH OF CITY BLOCKS (EL CAJON BLVD IN SAN DIEGO, CA). I HAD TO PULL OVER SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE I COULD NOT CONTROL THE SPEED. IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. I REMOVED THE PLACEMAT AND THE ISSUE CONTINUED. IN FACT, WHEN I APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR, THE TACHOMETER WENT FROM 4K RPM TO 8K RPM IN THE RED ZONE EVEN THOUGH I WAS BARELY TOUCHING THE ACCELERATOR. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS OCCURRED BUT IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS I HAD TO PLACE THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL WHEN ACTUALLY RIDING ON THE STREET JUST TO CONTROL MY SPEED.

THEY HAVE A RECALL FOR ONE TIME ONLY REPLACEMENT WHICH WAS DOEN IN 97 AT 51K MI. BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER.  LAST DEC. I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS AND THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP DID NOT ADVISE ME THAT I HAD A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  THEY WANTED TO CHANGE OUT FUEL INJECTORS SINCE IT WAS RUNNING ROUGH.  THE ROUGHNESS WAS FROM COOLANT LEAKING INTO THE CYLINDERS. AFTER RESEARCH I FOUND ALL THIS INFO. OUT.  AT THE TIME I WAS IGNORANT AS TO THIS PROBLEM.  FRED HAS TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP FRONT WITH ME AND ADVISED ME F THE SITUATION INSTEAD OF MAKING ME PAY FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T NEED.  AS THEY HAVE DONE TO ME IN THE PAST.  THE EXHAUST GASES ESCAPING INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM ARE OVER PRESSURIZE MY SYSTEM AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT BLEW THE BOTTOM HOSE OFF THE RADIATOR.  IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PARKING LOT OR EVEN MY OWN FAMILY WOULD HAVE BEEN STANDING 15 FEET IN FREON OF THE VEHICLE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD 3RD DEGREE BURNS.  THUS, I HAD BEEN DRIVING IT SINCE DEC AND LEARNING OF WHAT MY PROBLEM IS.  IT WAS A SLOW LEAK AT FIRST , BUT GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  IT STARTED OVERHEATING ON ME SO I CHANGED THE THERMOSTAT, FAN CLUTCH. RADIATOR, AND RADIATOR CAP.  PAID ALL THAT MONEY TO FIND OUT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM IS THE EXHAUST GASES OVER PRESSURIZE THE COOLANT SYSTEM DUE TO THE BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  TOYOTA HAS STOOD THEIR GROUND AND SAID THEY'VE LIVED UP TO THEIR ONE TIME ONLY RECALL.  IM SURE YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THIS \"MASSIVE\" AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEIR HEAD GASKET PROBLEM.  I JUST WISHED TOYOTA VALUED CUSTOMER SERVICE/LOYALTY.  *JB",

BUT MY CAR IS STILL GIVEN ME PROBLEMS, THE VOLTMETER KEEP SHAKING ALL THE TIME BACK AND FORTH FROM HIGH TO AND JUST BEFORE THE DANGER PART OF THE VOLTMETER. ON OCT. 5,1998, HEADGASKETS WERE REPLACE BECAUSE OF A RECALL. BUT ON OCT. 19,1999 MY CAR WAS LEAKING OIL, SO I TOOK CAR TO GET SERVICE FOR BRAKES AND TO CHECK OIL LEAK, AIR CONDITION WHICH WAS HAD NOT BEING WORKING. B&L TOYOTA, DID THE BRAKES AND THEY CLAIMED THAT THERE WAS NOTING WRONG WITH THE AIR CONDITION AND THAT THE OIL LEAK WAS JUST A LOOSE BOLT. THE NEXT DAY I FOUND OIL LEAKING FROM MY CAR AGAIN AND THE AIR WAS NOT THROWING COOL AIR. I TOOL THE CAR BACK AND THEY FOUND THAT THE HEADGASKEST WERE DAMAGE AND THAT THE AIR CONDITION VALVE WAS NO GOOD AND KEPT THE CAR FROM OCT. 27,1999 TO NOV. 10,1999 TO REPLACE THE PARTS. IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE PARTS THEY CUT WIRES FROM AN EXTRA CUT OFF SWITCH THAT I HAVE IN THE CAR. THEY TRIED TO FIX THE SWITCH AND HAD BIG PROBLEMS TRYING TO GET MY CAR TO STAR. THEY FIX THE SWITCH DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL WAY IT WAS DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE. MY BRAKES ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME SOUND THAT THEY WERE MAKING FROM THE TIME THEY REPLACED THEM. IT COST ME $366.60 TO FIX MY FRONT BRAKES AND TO REPLACE STEERING STOPS THAT ONLY COST $3.26 EACH. THEY HAVE NOT CHECK TO SEE IF IS SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THEM THE BRAKES. ALL I KNOW IS THAT SINCE THEY REPLACED SOME PARTS AND DID THE BRAKES, PATCHED UP THE WIRES FROM THE EXTRA CUT OFF SWITCH MY CAR HAS NOT BEING WORKING FINE.
