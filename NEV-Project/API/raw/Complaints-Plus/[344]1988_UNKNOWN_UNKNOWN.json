THEY WERE ST205/75/R14'S.  I USE THE BOAT ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR.  WHEN IT IS NOT BEING USED IT IS STORED IN A GARAGE.  ON MY RECENT FISHING TRIP I HAD A BLOWOUT ON THE WAY TO THE LAKE.  THE TREAD CAME COMPLETELY OFF OF THE TIRE, RUINING MY FIBERGLASS FENDER ON THE TRAILER AND RUINING MY BOAT COVER.  THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH APPARENTLY.  ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE LAKE, THE OTHER TIRE STARTED TO VIBRATE.  WE PULLED OVER TO CHECK IT AND WE COULD SEE THAT THE TIRE TREAD WAS STARTING TO SEPARATE FROM THE TIRE.  STEEL BELT MATERIAL WAS SHOWING IN A FEW PLACES AND IT WAS LOSING AIR.  FORTUNATELY WE GOT TO A LITTLE SAFER SPOT TO FIX THE SECOND TIRE.  WE SPENT TWO HOURS GETTING THE SECOND ONE FIXED (SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE A SPARE ANYMORE).  NONE OF US WERE HURT FORTUNATELY.  I HAVE THE SECOND TIRE IN MY POSSESSION. *TR",
