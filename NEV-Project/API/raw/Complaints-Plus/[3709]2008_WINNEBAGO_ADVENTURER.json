ON NOVEMBER 30,2008, I WAS TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE 10 IN ALABAMA WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET AT 65.  AHEAD OF ME IN MY LANE WAS A STOPPED CAR.  THERE WAS TRAFFIC IN THE LEFT LANE SO I COULDN'T MOVE OVER.  I HIT THE   BRAKE AND THE CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT DISENGAGE.  I COULD HEAR THE BRAKES AGAINST THE WHEELS, BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT SLOW.  I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND STILL THE CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT DISENGAGE.  I HIT   THE BRAKES HARDER AND THEN THE CRUISE CONTROL RELEASED AND THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SLOW.  BY THEN I WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE STOPPED CAR, AND HAD TO QUICKLY DRIVE ON TO THE SHOULDER AND PASS THE CAR ON   THE RIGHT.  I BARELY MISSED IT, AND WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 45 MPH WHEN I WENT BY ON THE SHOULDER.  IF THERE HAD BEEN INSUFFICIENT SHOULDER I WOULD HAVE REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE WITH THE MOTOR HOME.  THE CRUISE CONTROL IS DISABLED AND WON'T TURN ON.  APPARENTLY FORCING IT OFF BY HARD BRAKING MUST HAVE BLOWN A FUSE OR TRIGGERED SOME BACKUP DISENGAGEMENT DEVICE OR SWITCH.  I WILL BE TAKING THE MOTOR HOME TO AN AUTHORIZED WORKHORSE SERVICE CENTER TO HAVE THE CRUISE CONTROL REPAIRED. *TR",
