WHILE TRAVELING A TRAFFIC SIGNAL WAS TURNING RED AND I BEGAN SLOWING. AS I WAS ATTEMPTING TO SLOW DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL CONTINUED TO TRAVEL TO THE FLOOR AND THE BRAKE LIGHT WARNING AND SERVICE BRAKE SYSTEM LIGHT CAME ON. I WAS QUICKLY CLOSING IN ON THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME AND REDUCED MY SPEED BY STANDING ON THE BRAKED AND USING ENGINE SPEED SHIFTING FROM DRIVE TO 3RD TO 2ND AND THEN TO FIRST GEAR. I WAS ABLE TO STOP WITHIN A FOOT OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. AFTER THIS I PULLED OVER TO INSPECT MY VEHICLE. I LOCATED A BLOWN BRAKE LINE THAT WAS SEVERELY CORRODED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ALONG THE FRAME OF THE VEHICLE. BRAKE FLUID WAS LEAKING OUT. IN ADDITION, THE OTHER BRAKE LINES APPEAR TO BE EXTREMELY CORRODED AS WELL.     THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN CONSIDERING BRAKES ARE SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO SAFE DRIVING. IT APPEARS THE BRAKE LINES ARE NOT MADE FOR A SUITABLE QUALITY FOR SUCH A CRITICAL SYSTEM. THE EXHAUST PIPE, WHICH IS UNDER THE VEHICLE AS WELL, IS NOT CORRODED AND IS MADE OUT OF SUITABLE QUALITY MATERIAL. IF THERE ARE OTHER VEHICLES OUT THERE ON THE ROAD WITH SIMILAR MATERIALS THE RESULTS MAY BE INJURIOUS OR DEADLY. PLEASE HELP TO ADDRESS AND RECTIFY THIS SITUATION WITH CHEVROLET.   *TR",

MY TAILGATE HANDLE BROKE WHILE OPENING IT HANDLE REPLACEMENT WAS $568.    TO MY SURPRISE AND APPARENTLY ALSO TO THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEALERSHIP  THE EXISTING SPOILER HAD TO BE TORN OFF AND REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE TO ACCESS THE HANDLE. THAT WAS AN ADDITIONAL $186 PLUS LABOR.  I QUESTION THE DESIGNERS OF THE TAILGATE ASSEMBLY. WHY WOULD ANYONE DESIGN PARTS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DESTROYED IN ORDER TO SERVICE ANOTHER PART?  IN FACT, WHY WOULD ANY PART THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE USED FREQUENTLY BY A REGULAR TRUCKER BREAK SO EASILY?  OF COURSE, NEITHER THE WARRANTY NOR THE GM PROTECTION PLAN COVERED THIS.  THE NEXT PROBLEM OCCURRED ON 12/27/06 AT 41,901 MILES, MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULDN'T SHUTOFF. INTO THE DEALERSHIP WE WENT AND $334 LATER A WIPER BOARD WAS REPLACED.  NO WARRANTY AGAIN COVERED THIS PROBLEM.  I NO SOONER GOT HOME AND HAD TO RETURN ON 12/28/06 AT 41,944 MILES.  NOW MY DASHBOARD LIGHT  SERVICE 4 WHEEL DRIVE WAS ON.  THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THE TRANSFER CASE ENCODER SHORTED OUT AND $779 LATER IT WAS FIXED. I MIGHT HAVE USED THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE 8-10 TIMES AT THE MOST.  AT THAT TIME, I'D OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR 29 MONTHS, THAT'S PRETTY SAD!!                TODAY WITH THE LATEST EPISODE, I TRIED TO LOWER MY FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW AND IT WOULDN'T WORK.

WHEN I RETURNED TO THE BIG COUNTRY CHEVROLET IN HEMINGWAY, SC AND THEY RAN THE DIAGNOSTICS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CLUSTER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR $380.
