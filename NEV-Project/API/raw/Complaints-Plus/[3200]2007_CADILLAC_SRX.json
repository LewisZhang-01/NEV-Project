        "summary": "PLEASE INVESTIGATE! APPROX. 3 DAYS AGO I WAS COMING TO A STOP SIGN IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA & APPLIED BRAKES. SPEED LIMIT IS 25, BUT I WAS GOING SLOWER, JUST TO THE CORNER PAST MY HOME. NOT ONLY DID BRAKES NOT WORK- THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN TO ABOUT 35-40 MPH- NO GAS APPLIED. TRIED PUMPING BRAKES, SHIFTING THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL, REVERSE, PARK- ALL WHILE AT AN UNEXPECTED ACCELERATED SPEED. I PLOWED INTO A RESIDENTIAL YARD WHICH HAD A SMALL HILL THINKING MAYBE I COULD STOP THE CAR THAT WAY. THAT DIDN'T WORK. I SWERVED BACK INTO THE STREET; CAR STILL REVVING AND MOVING FORWARD. AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO CRASH INTO A HOUSE, POLE OR ANOTHER VEHICLE. I ENDED UP HALFWAY ON THE STREET AND HALFWAY ON A CURB AFTER CONTINUOUSLY TRYING THE BRAKES AND SHIFTING FROM DRIVE TO PARK (VEHICLE STILL ACCELERATING AS IF IT WAS POSSESSED!!) AND JUST BEFORE HITTING A LIGHT POLE, WITH DRIVER SIDE DOOR OPEN THINKING I'D RATHER JUMP OUT OF A MOVING VEHICLE THAN DIE FROM RAMMING INTO A POLE, HOUSE OR CAR- I THOUGHT TO TURN PHYSICALLY TURN OFF THE IGNITION WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN DRIVE. THIS IS THE ONLY WAS THE CAR WOULD STOP MOVING. THIS WAS A VERY DISTURBING AND DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE. I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS NOT A NORMAL ISSUE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED BY THE MANUFACTURER- WHATEVER IT IS. MY MECHANIC STILL HAS NOT DETERMINED WHAT THE ISSUE IS. WE KNOW IT ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS JUST FIXING THE BRAKES. I AND/OR OTHER PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE PROCESS AND EVEN WORSE, MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CAR WHICH THANKFULLY THEY WERE NOT. THIS WAS SUCH A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR FOR FEAR IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN WITH MY CHILDREN INSIDE. IF I HAVE THE CAR REPAIRED, I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE SELLING IT TO ANYONE ELSE- IT'S THAT DANGEROUS! PLEASE INVESTIGATE. THIS PROBLEM IS DEADLY. 2004 CADILLAC SRX 4DR",

THE FOLLOWING MORNING OF THE INCIDENT I WENT ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS SEVERAL IDENTICAL INCIDENTS WITH THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL OF CAR, AS WELL AS OTHERS. WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CONTACTING GM CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AS IT SEEMS THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE A FACTORY DEFECT.

I CAN HAVE THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR DOES NOT MOVE, EVEN THOUGH THE MOTOR IS STILL RUNNING.  IT IS AS IF THE CAR IS IN NEUTRAL.  ONCE YOU TURN THE CAR OFF AND ON AGAIN, IT WILL RUN FINE FOR A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK OR SO BEFORE HAPPENING AGAIN.  THIS HAS HAPPENED 4 OR 5 TIMES AND THE DEALER SAYS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  ONE TIME I WAS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY AND COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE ROAD.  OTHER VEHICLES WERE SWERVING AROUND ME AT 60+ MILES PER HOUR.  I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED ANY ONE OF THE TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE.  THIS STARTED AT ONLY 25,000 MILES.  I ALSO HAVE A GRINDING NOISE IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AS WELL AS WHEN THE FRONT WHEELS ARE TURNED.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON ALMOST EVER SINCE I GOT THE VEHICLE 14 MONTHS AGO.  IT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE DEALER TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND IS STILL NOT FIXED.  I EVEN CALLED GM/CADILLAC AND STILL GOT NO SATISFACTION.  I AM AFRAID THE WHEELS ARE GOING TO FALL OFF AT ANYTIME.  I AM ALSO  AFRAID I AM GOING TO BE HURT WHEN THESE PROBLEMS HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY, IT IS A COMPANY VEHICLE AND I HAVE TO CARRY FELLOW EMPLOYEES WITH ME ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.  I NO LONGER CARRY ANYONE WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER.  NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG OR HOW TO FIX IT AND CADILLAC HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY UNCOOPERATIVE WITH ME. *TR",

HISTORY:  ALL 24 LUG NUTS FOUND LOOSE OR FINGER TIGHT (ABLE TO BE REMOVED BY HAND WITH SOCKET BUT WITHOUT USING WRENCH) AT 3,500 MILES.  TIGHTENED BY OWNER USING OWNER'S CALIBRATED/CERTIFIED TORQUE WRENCH AND RETURNED VEHICLE TO DEALER FOR INSPECTION.  DEALER FOUND ALL LUG NUTS TIGHT.  DEALER RETURNED CAR TO OWNER.   NUTS RE-CHECKED AND FOUND  LOOSE ON 3 WHEELS.  RETURNED TO DEALER TO INSPECT AND TIGHTEN.  DEALER FOUND ALL LUG NUTS TIGHT BUT BROKE ONE (1) WHEEL STUD OFF TIGHTENING LOOSE STUD BEFORE REACHING SPECIFIED TORQUE.  DEALER RE-CHECKED THE PREVIOUSLY VERIFIED NUTS AND FOUND 3 NUTS ON ONE WHEEL AT LESS THAN THE PROPER TORQUE.   NO SIGN OF WHEEL DAMAGE FOUND.  ALL NUTS AND STUDS THREADED SMOOTHLY AND DID NOT APPEAR DAMAGED.  NO EVIDENCE  PAINT ACTED AS A SHIM THUS PREVENTING STUDS FROM ACHIEVING NECESSARY CLAMPING FORCE.  CONCLUSION: DETERMINED PROBLEM IS NOT THAT THE WHEEL NUTS WERE LOOSE, BUT THAT THEY WOULDN'T STAY TIGHT.   POSSIBLE CAUSE(S):  DEFECTIVE STUDS WITH IMPROPER STEEL HARDENING OR MATERIAL.  HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT OF THE HARDENED ELECTROPLATED STUDS.  OVERTIGHTENED STUDS WHICH STRETCHED BEYOND ELASTIC LIMIT.  REASON OR TIME OF POSSIBLE OVER-TIGHTENING UNKNOWN; DEALERS RECORDS DO NOT SHOW WHEELS HAVE BEEN OFF THE VEHICLE.

NO EVIDENCE THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT DEFORMING HOLES IN WHEEL.  REMEDY:  DEALER REMOVED AND INSPECTED WHEEL AND AXLE FLANGE AND REPLACED ALL WHEEL STUDS AND NUTS.  RESULT: NEW STUDS ARE PERFORMING SATISFACTORY AND HOLDING PROPER TORQUE.  NOT KNOWN IF OLD PARTS WERE KEPT.  *TR",
