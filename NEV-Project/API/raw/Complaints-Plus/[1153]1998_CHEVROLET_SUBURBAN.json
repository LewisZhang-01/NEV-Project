I WAS STOPPED AT THE ENTRY OF A PARKING, THE ENGINE RACED AND THE CAR PLOUGHED AHEAD, ALTHOUGH I CONTINUOUSLY APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. THE C5 ACCELERATED AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND STOPPED ONLY AFTER I APPLIED THE PARKING BRAKE AND CUT THE IGNITION. THE CAR WAS REPAIRED. THE HEAD MECHANIC, ASSURED ME MY CAR WAS IN ORDER WHEN I TOOK IT BACK. I  REQUESTED  THE GARAGE CONSULT A GM EXPERT ON THAT SORT OF ACCIDENT. HE DID NOT COMPLY WITH THAT REQUEST.THE DYSFUNCTION OCURRED AGAIN.  SECOND ACCIDENT : MAY 7TH, 03. I PARKED. I HAD, AT THE END OF THIS MANEUVER, THE RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE, (TO SLOW THE CAR WHICH AT THIS TIME CRAWLED), WHEN THE ENGINE ACCELERATED. THE C5 STOPPED AFTER I JAMMED ON THE BRAKE AND CUT THE IGNITION  REMARKS AND CONCLUSION. THE C5 SUDDENLY TOOK OFF ON IT'S OWN, THE THROTTLE IN A FULL OPEN POSITION, WITHOUT THE DRIVER STEPPING ON  THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE BRAKES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE SOON ENOUGH TO AVOID THE ACCIDENTS. ONLY SWITCHING OFF THE IGNITION WAS EFFECTIVE TO STOP THE VEHICLE. I HAD MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE GEAR LEVER WAS IN DRIVE.  AS ANY ENGINEER KNOWS, GIVEN THAT ELECTRONIC LOGIC IS SENSITIVE TO INTERFERENCES AND THE C5 COMPARTMENT IS FLOODED  WITH VIOLENTS SIGNALS; IT WAS IMPERATIVE, AFTER THE FIRST SERIOUS INCIDENT, TO INSTALL A BLACK BOX OR TIMESTAMPING RECORDING DEVICE, FILMING AND RECORDING THE ACTUAL FOOT POSITION OF THE DRIVER, THE THROTTLE AND BRAKE POSITIONS, ENGINE RPM AND VEHICLE SPEED IN ORDER TO ANALYZE A POSSIBLE RE-OCCURENCE OF THE EVENT.
