This is an optional all digital instrument panel cluster with programmable color that was a $2,200 option when new. I read online in car forums reports of many others having the same exact issue with the optional 2018 Mustang digital instrument cluster failing and going dark some within weeks of the car being new, and there was a recall on this instrument panel going dark for the 2019 model year. I saw an online post where a driver is driving for 6 months without the speedometer or warning lights functioning because of the repair cost being more than $2000. I got a quote from a Ford dealer for my repair today: $2396.00. This car is less than 5 months out of bumper-to-bumper Ford warranty and under the 36,000 miles limit at 30,383. This appears to be a known and apparently frequent safety issue so I thought Ford customer support might help me out but on calling them today they said they cannot do anything to help. They expect me to pay the $2396.00 for repairs with no assistance for what looks to be an inherent safety defect.",

ONE SUCH SCENARIO THAT CAUSED GREAT ISSUE WAS ADJUSTING THE CLIMATE CONTROL DURING COLDER MONTHS WHEN THE WINDOWS/WINDSHIELD FOG UP. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN'T SEE WHILE DRIVING. TYPICALLY, I CAN REACT QUICKLY TO GET RID OF THE FOG, BUT SINCE THIS COMPONENT IS DEFECTIVE, THE SYSTEM DID NOT RESPOND AND THE FOG HAD TO BE MANUALLY REMOVED.    ADDITIONALLY, THIS COMPONENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED WITHIN 2YR OF PURCHASE OF THE CAR, SINCE IT IS A COMPUTER. FORD OFFERED TO REPLACE THE APIM COMPONENT, FOR $1000 (WARRANTY EXPIRED AT TIME OF DIAGNOSTIC TEST). WHAT IS EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS IS THAT THEY WANT TO REPLACE IT WITH THE EXACT SAME MODEL NUMBER, WHICH TELLS ME IN ANOTHER 2YR I MAY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.

THIS HAPPENED ANY TIME DRIVING OVER UNEVEN SURFACES, TURNING CURVES AND ACCELERATING. THEY REPLACED THE SHOCK ABSORBER AFTER THE CAR WAS IN THE SHOP 11 DAYS. IN JANUARY 2019 I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH 3,893 MILES. THE CAR WAS STILL MAKING A GRINDING, POPPING SOUND IN THE REAR END AS WELL AS THE FRONT END.

THE LOOSE FEELING WAS GOING AROUND CURVES, LEFT OR RIGHT TURNING FROM A STOP LIGHT AS WELL AS ACCELERATING FROM A STOP. THE CAR ALSO FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY.

I FEEL THIS CAR IS UNSAFE AS IT IS SUCH A NEW CAR, HAS BEEN BABIED FROM THE FIRST DAY PURCHASED. THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP TWICE ALMOST 30 DAYS OF ITS LIFE, UNDER 4,000 MILES AND HAVING THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL REPLACED SHOWS THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THIS CAR. ALL THIS BEING REPORTED TO CARFAX HAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED THE VALUE OF MY CAR SINCE IT DOES NOT REPORT IT AS FACTORY DEFECT BUT RATHER POSSIBLE ABUSE. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS JUST MY CAR OR A SAFETY ISSUE FROM THE FACTORY. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE CAR TO LOCK UP ON THE HIGHWAY AND HE CONFIRMED IT WAS DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY.
