Dealership could repeat problem once, but never fixed it. Took vehicle in at least half a dozen times. Never fixed. Car also makes an odd humming when gas is applied. This week, car started and died after driving a foot. Then car wouldn\u2019t start at all. Brakes stiffened up and wouldn\u2019t compress without substantial effort. Everything resolved on its own within 30 minutes. But the very next day, pulled inti position in our alley to back our Suburban into the garage. Put car in reverse. While using the back up cam (that came on like normal when car is in reverse), i applied gas. The car didn\u2019t respond at all (didn\u2019t even rev like what happens when you apply gas while car is in neutral). I applied a touch more gas and car all of a sudden lurched forward with the full force of a V8 engine being floored. I tried to slam on the brakes, but the brakes wouldn\u2019t respond in such a way that i thought my shoe must have gotten stuck. It hadn\u2019t. The brakes did not work. I don\u2019t know how long it would have taken to finally stop because we only had 5 feet to go before we slammed into our neighbor\u2019s house (which is what stopped our vehicle). Car is not drivable and I wouldn\u2019t drive it if it were. It is available for inspection. Will be towed once scheduled.",
