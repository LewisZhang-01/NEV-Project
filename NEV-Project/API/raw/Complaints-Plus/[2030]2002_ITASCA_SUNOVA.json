I BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT DUE TO THE POOR METHOD OF ATTACHMENT TO THE FRAME OF THE MOTORHOME, AS EVIDENCED BY THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LEFT SIDE ARCH PANEL. PLEASE HELP WITH GETTING THIS SITUATION RECTIFIED, THE MANUFACTURER HAS REBUFFED MY ATTEMPTS TO GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED.  THANKS",
