This issue causes the vehicle to have trouble starting up after refueling. I currently own and and use a 2018 Ford Focus as my primary (only) form of transport. This vehicle is experiencing the same exact issues noted in the above mentioned recall. I have made contact with Ford  through dealerships as well as through their customer service chat and they have advised me that the included vehicles in their recalls are determined by the date and location of manufacture and my vehicle is not included. I am hoping someone can help me with this as it is a serious safety issue. My vehicle refuses to start after refueling until multiple attempts are made causing undue wear and tear on the starter. It is obvious that this issue is getting worse as the vehicle now shudders at times and acts as thought it is going to stall out or it is not getting enough fuel or has air entering into the fuel system. The check engine light is on and the codes states there is a problem with the emissions. I would really like to have this problem addressed as I am fearful of being stranded or worse yet the vehicle stalling out in traffic. Ford told me that I would need repair this at my own cost and MAYBE  some day it will be added and they will reimburse me for the cost. Is there anything thing that can be done to assist with this issue short of me paying with money that I  absolutely do not have? Please help!",

It took a minute but car initially started. I drove 2 miles home and when i got to a stop sign my car wouldn\u2019t go. When autozone opened i took my car 2 miles to have them test the battery. The tech said,\u201dhey is your car off, the machine says it\u2019s still on.\u201d I stated it wasn\u2019t but he went inside my car to see if it was. He thought that was weird and so did I. The battery was good. So I proceeded to head to quicklane which was 2 miles aways. This time when I got to a intersection my car begin to shake and rpm wouldn\u2019t go up as I attempted to accelerate. I pulled over, to get a tow. When i started the car again oil, battery and overheating light turned on. At Quicklane I got terrible news, that coolant was leaking into engine and that I may need a engine or my head gasket replace. Which may cost at minimum $4000. I asked how could this happened I get my car serviced here all the time. Wouldn\u2019t the ford mechanic detected coolant leaking into oil. When they test that as well. I read that ecoboost suv were recalled but my focus is ecoboost and have similar issues. I treat my car with care get any and every service suggested by Quicklane. Quicklane worker stated that my 2018 car that i bought brand new no miles in 2/19/2019 was old. How so i had a 1997 camry with 330k miles never did this and had same motor. I never got a warning on car about a coolant leak. This is a shame that at 72k miles, I am having to buy a expensive engine or new car.

I called the dealership that I bought this ford focus brand new in 2018 which has 20,000 miles now and the girl answering phones at Brandon Ford Tampa Fl. said my car would not be covered for my problem under warranty.

Also not changing gears properly. It has left me several times with not giving me the option to reverse. For the first year i constantly took the car to ford dealerships to get checked with everytime it coming back with nothing wrong. I wasted time, money and it was really an inconvenience with the whole hassel. Not to mention the stress it put me through which led to mental issues, psychiatric visits and medications. I contacted ford several times and was also getting the run arround. They finally felt they could shut me with some type of free maintenance plan which at that time decided to give up and just accept. 5 months later took the car again with same issues and finally was told my a service rep that a transmission tech had never even looked it in tge past times. After being checked they had to replace something with the clutch. Also about months later some with the fuel valve/pcv had to be repaired which has been a recall for ford but not my specific vehicle/vin. And now only after 3 yeats of owning the car again having issues the same if not worse with the transmission. I no longer have bumber to bumber, powertain or extended warranty due to too many miles. I will be taking it tomorrow which i am sure is going to cost a lot not to mention i am still paying for the car. Oh and ford said even if it was the same thing with the clutch their repair warranty is only 2 years and i just passed that by a couple of months. I have always had used old cars and went through the hassle of car repairs. Being a single mom and moving to a bigger city to pursue my education i decided to buy a new vehicle so I wouldn't have problems but its been a nightmare with this car! I haven't been in a position to trade it or buy another car. I have just had to deal with it and its brought tears & caused mental issues.",

After about 30 minutes everything restarts but the car only goes a few miles before cutting out again. This failure is extremely dangerous. We took the car to Town and Country Ford in Nashville  TN on Monday July 26,2021 and picked it up on Friday July 30. They said it had been repaired, I drove approximately 6 miles and was on a 5 lane highway doing 60mph when it happened again. I was lucky to safely get to the side of the road. Since the air conditioning and windows also stopped when the heat index was 105 degrees that represents another possible danger. On Sunday July 25 the engine light came on, but being Sunday there was no place to read the code. After the first failure occurred about 10am Monday we had the code read as a P1450. As I hadn't had any experience with fuel system/ emission control we decided to take it to the above dealer. At the time of the Friday failure there was no code or warning. This failure method is extremely dangerous as a car may suddenly stop running in high speed traffic. I have no Idea what would  have happened if i had been going uphill. Also if the service tech cannot detect the problem it may be widespread. Vehicle is currently in the dealership.",

THE CAR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME WAS A TOYOTA SUV AND HAD A TOW-BAR, WHICH TOOK MOST OF THE IMPACT OF THE CRASH AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. ASIDE FROM SOME MINOR SCRATCHES, BOTH OF THE OTHER CARS INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT WERE FINE AND THE TWO DRIVERS WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THEIR WAYS TO WORK. MY CAR, ON THE OTHER HAND HAS BEEN DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY AS IT IMMEDIATELY BURST INTO FLAMES UPON IMPACT. AS I MENTIONED ABOVE, THE TRAFFIC WAS SLOW-MOVING SO WE WERE NOT TRAVELING AT MORE THAN 25-30MPH AT ANY TIME ON THAT STRETCH AS WE NAVIGATED THE TRAFFIC. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY LOW-IMPACT AND MINOR INCIDENT; HOWEVER, FOR SOME UNKNOWN AND UNEXPLAINABLE REASON, THE FORD FOCUS WAS ON FIRE BEFORE I EVEN KNEW THAT I HAD CRASHED. THE IMPACT WAS SO MINIMAL THAT NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. FIREFIGHTERS WERE ONSITE WITHIN 5 MINUTES AND HAD DIFFICULTY PUTTING OUT THE BLAZE. IN ADDITION, I WAS STILL IN THE CAR WHILE IT WAS ON FIRE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY UPON IMPACT, SO WHILE I WAS LUCKY TO WALK AWAY WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL INJURIES, I WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO THE AMBULANCE TO MONITOR MY VITALS AND TRY TO CONTROL MY SHOCK. I REALIZE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS OF FORD FOCUS VEHICLES PURCHASED IN 2017 AND PRIOR; HOWEVER, I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE SAFETY CONCERNS RAISED IN PREVIOUS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORD PERTAIN DIRECTLY TO THE 2018 MODEL AS WELL.

SUDDENLY WITH WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GUN SHOT, THE SUNROOF EXPLODED AND I WAS COVERED WITH GLASS AS THE SUNROOF COVER WAS OPEN.  FORTUNATELY I HAD A HAT ON OTHERWISE THE VERY SMALL SHARDS MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN INTO MY HAIR, EYES AND FACE.   PULLED OF THE HIGHWAY AND TOOK A COUPLE PICTURES.  THE DAMAGES FROM THE EXPLODING GLASS CAUSED ADDITIONAL DAMAGES TO THE ROOF AND WING OF THE CAR.  THIS IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT OVER $2600 IN DAMAGES.  NOT TO MENTION THE CLEAN UP THE THE INTERIOR CAR WILL NEED.  THANK GOD MY KIDS WEREN'T IN THE BACK SEAT AS THEY WOULD HAVE GOT THE BRUNT OF THE GLASS.",
