I PICKED IT UP A WEEK LATER.  UPON GETTING IT HOME I STARTED CLEANING IT AND REALIZED THAT THE WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED AGAIN AND THE SEAL AROUND THE WINDOW WAS NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED. I WAS ADVISED AGAIN TO TAKE IT BACK TO JIM'S  MARINA. I DROPPED IT OFF ON 9-23-2013, PICKED IT UP  2 WEEKS  LATER AND AGAIN THE SAME THING WITH THE WINDSHIELD.  I WAS TOLD FOR THE 3RD TIME TO TAKE IT BACK TO JIM'S MARINA. I DROPPED IT OFF ON 10-12-2013, PICKED IT UP 2 WEEKS LATER AND BASICALLY PARKED IT FOR THE WINTER. UPON TAKING A TRIP IN THE MOTORHOME IN MAY, I WAS GETTING GAS AND DECIDED TO CLEAN THE WINDSHIELD. UPON LOOKING UP, YOU COULD SEE A CRACK IN THE WINDSHIELD ALONG THE TINT. AGAIN I CALLED THE FLEETWOOD AGENT AT WHICH TIME I WAS ADVISED THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK WITH ME. WHEN THE FLEETWOOD AGENT  CALLED ME BACK I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE IT TO CICERO, NY. I DROPPED IT OFF ON 06-16-2013 AT BURDICK CARS & RV. I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THE AGENT AT THIS TIME.   *TR",
