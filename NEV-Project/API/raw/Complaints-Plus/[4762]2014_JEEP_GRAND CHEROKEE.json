(I previously spent the winters in Florida; this car was not involved in driving to and from Florida.) I am retired.  Due to my retirement status and COVID restrictions since 2020, my driving has been limited to about 3,000 miles per year.   Without any prior warning, the oil filter-cooler housing adaptor assembly failed, causing oil to leak out of the engine through the o-rings and onto the transmission housing.  This created a mess under the car anywhere it was parked.  It creates a hazardous condition because the leaked oil can cause people to slip and fall wherever it lays on the ground, and if the driver is on the road and the engine loses enough oil and oil pressure, it can result in extensive damage to the engine, maybe an accident.   I have checked your database, and see that this problem has not been part of any recall.  However, I've also done some online searching and discovered that mine is not an isolated problem. https://www.carproblemzoo.com/jeep/grandcherokee/2014/engine-oil-leaking-problems.php  The problem was identified by my mechanic at Empire Automotive of WNY  716-681-7187, and repaired at their shop on Feb. 23, 2022.  They did show us the part that failed.  I do not know if they still have the old part, but they can explain the problem in detail because they told us they had done two other repairs for the same problem on 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokees during the previous week.  The cost of this repair came to $848.41.  I think it is outrageous that this problem, which appears to be a flaw in engineering, and has occurred in a significant number of 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokees, has not been subject to a recall.    I need your help and advice to determine the next step I should take in trying to get some dealer help for paying for this unexpected repair.

Took vehicle to nearest mechanic and without even inspecting it, the mechanic (non dealership) stated it was likely the oil filter housing as he had replaced a # of these in recent memory due to the plastic melting and/or cracking.  The mechanic confirmed the next day that this was in deed the issue and the oil filter housing had to be replaced due to mine being cracked.  There appears to be thousands of these cases reported to nhtsa, yet the manufacturer is yet to recall this, which is a significant safety hazzard. Allowing a manufacturer to use a piece of plastic that is known to fail,  to store and/or transfer a highly flammable liquid such as oil  is a tragedy in the making.  Oil leaking onto the engine and other components of the vehicle can cause a fire without the vehicle occupants knowing anything about it.  If the manufacturer is unwilling to proactively recall this flawed part, then the nhtsa needs to step in and force a recall before a vehicle catches fire and there is a loss of life.",

        "summary": "The pillar loop of the seatbelt cracked on the driver's seat belt. The piece that guides the seatbelt in the pillar loop cracked, and as a result it now pinches the seatbelt and prevents the seatbelt from retracting. It is pinched so tightly that I can't even manually \"retract\" it by pushing the seatbelt back into the door/wall, and instead my seatbelt hangs loosely in the seat around me. Since the seatbelt hangs loosely around the seat and can't even be manually retracted, I may as well not have access to a seatbelt which is a very dangerous situation. If I were to crash, the seatbelt would be completely ineffective.  No event occurred to cause the crack. There were no warning signs, lights, or indications that something was wrong until one day I got in the car and it would just no longer retract. The first appearance of the issue was around January 27, 2022. It was very cold the week it happened so I am unsure if the cold temperature had anything to do with the crack, however a seat belt should not break because of cold weather.  My vehicle is available for inspection upon request, and to date the issue has not been confirmed by a dealer or service center since it is very obviously an issue. Additionally, it has not been inspected yet as the quoted prices for fixing it are extremely high even though it appears to be a malfunction of the specific piece of safety equipment, as exhibited by the abundance of identical complaints specifically for my make and model (2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee).",

I reached out to Jeep and they denied anything was wrong with the dash on their end and it was my fault for improper care of the car. I found this to be in contrast with research online of a large amount of complaints for the same model as mine suffering the same dashboard glue issues. In December of 2019, I received a notice from Jeep that they would be replacing the dashboard so in January of 2020 I dropped my car off at the local dealership, Joey Accardi. After not hearing from them, I sent an email on February 12, 2020 requesting an update. They advised they submitted a request for approval of the replacement to Jeep and were waiting to hear back. I picked up my vehicle as they could not provide a replacement timeline. After waiting several months I reached out to Jeep customer care Reference #75788102 and they advised they attempted to reach out to the dealership for an update with no response. After getting a response several days later they advised it was ordered and should arrive shortly. After waiting to hear back through the rest of 2020, I reached out again in February of 2021 to Jeep customer care Reference #78420942 and they \"escalated\" my issue to someone who called the dealership and was told it would arrive in May of 2021. They closed my case on February 5th without any further help or confirmation of receipt of part. I reached out again today, September 9th and received no help or any indication of replacement timeline. It has now been 3 years since I brought this to Jeeps attention and 22 months since they authorized replacement. My concern now is the dashboard material has dislodged two of my AC vents and has folded over where my airbag would deploy potentially causing harm or failure if the airbag were to attempt to deploy. This is clearly an issue with this year and model Jeep and they aren't remedying it potentially putting people in danger.",

        "summary": "Happy Wednesday:  Issue 11427346  THATS MY ISSUE TOO.   This is occurring with my vehicle with many others.  I found out today Power Steering Fluid ran out and was empty but no leak is detected.   It is the Steering rack where the fluid is going so it is undetected which can cause gears to lock up and crash since owners do not detect a leak and do not know where it is going.  I got an oil change and they told me it was almost empty buy inches and to get parked ASAP until it was filed and that there is an issue.  Miracle DODGE/Jeep in Gallatin, TN  said there must be an issue when we went to buy the power steering fluid at a dealership since the Jeep only takes MOPAR Hydraulic fluid at 22.00 a quart.  They are aware there is some issue if the fluid is empty but no leak detected by me or anyone else looking for one.  This is a issue with crash potential.  It could have killed me if i ran out 100% and my gears locked up.   My time is spent taking my cancer stricken mother to the Drs office and had II not got an oil change?  I would never know and my gears would have locked up.  Many have reported.  Why is this not a recall since the Steering rack being replaced is a $2000.00 cost to fix.   I have 68, 500 miles on my Jeep 2014 GC Limited with low miles?.   This is unheard of.  First, the faulty Engine Oil sensor $450.00 to fix, then the faulty seat belt clip breaking which was covered by you all and fixed..Now?  The Power steering rack eating up the Power steering fluid and leaking onto brake boots which mine look rusted so that would explain that but unseen by the driver?  HELP me and others who have reported this since 2020. Make it a RECALL ASAP.  Nobody has $2000 to $3000 to fix faulty issues with these Jeeps.  Please HELP!.   My stress levels are at an all time high from this newest issues with my Jeep.  I am not sure how much more I can handle with these faulty issues.   I feel like we all need to do a class action lawsuit.  Thank goodness for my Oil change.",

It wasn\u2019t until July 2021 that we discovered that fluid was leaking from the Steering Rack and Pinion and spraying fluid on to the engine.

(this repair is over 2000$ of which we do not have due to covid and the shut down of my wife job) Then I purchased another 2014 in which the dash was in way worse shape. I was under the impression that due to the previous letter that the repair should be covered under the X81. however, the dealer has informed me that the extension was only good for 6 months. On top of that, the parts are taking up to 1-2 years to receive. Also, if I had owned my SRT Jeep back when this campaign was done, given the current condition, I would have had the repair done or had ordered the parts for it. It is my thoughts that this dash, being as common as this is, should be covered due to me not owning the vehicle and the paperwork not being clear about the process could be completed by the dealer at no charge. To me it looked like I had to pay it, and would be reimbursed. I asked if they would be willing to sell me the part at a discounted rate, but the warranty department said there is nothing I could do.  To me, this dash issue causes a driving distraction as the dash is in such poor shape, at least with my SRT, that i find myself looking at it, instead of the road.",

THE SECOND DETACHMENT IS ON MY DRIVER SIDE HEADREST. IT DETACHED DURING PARKING IN 2019 SEPTEMBER. I BROUGHT MY CAR TO CHAPMAN DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP IN SCOTTSDALE, AZ. THE STAFF THERE TOLD ME THE ISSUE WAS A DESIGNING PROBLEM OF GRAND CHEROKEE. THEY USED A PLASTIC PART IN HEADREST. IT IS WEAK AND CAN BREAK OFF ANYTIME. THEY SAID IF I FIX MY DRIVER SEAT HEADREST USING THE SAME PLASTICS, IT CAN STILL EASILY BREAK SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PLASTIC THING IS TOO FRAGILE. THE STAFF TOLD ME CHRYSLER MIGHT RECALL IT VERY SOON AND SO I KEEP WAITING. IT'S BEEN NOVEMBER 2020 AND STILL NO RECALL. I WANT CHRYSLER TO FIX THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY. I DO NOT WANT TO USE ANOTHER WEAK PLASTIC PART THAT CAN RANDOMLY DETACH ANYTIME. IF THE DETACHMENT OCCURS WHEN I AM DRIVING 70+ MPH, CERTAINLY IT WILL KILL ME AND SOMEONE ELSE. I AM SCARED OF THE PLASTIC PART AND SO I AM DRIVING WITHOUT IT BEING FIXED, WHICH IS REALLY CAUSING MY NECK PROBLEM BECAUSE IT PUSHES MY HEAD SEVERAL INCHES FORWARD DURING DRIVING.

FCA CLEARLY INDICATED IN ITS LITERATURE REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT THAT THE PERFORMANCE, MILEAGE, ADBLUE/BLUEDEF USAGE, ETC.

A MAJOR AND DANGEROUS HESITATION/LAG OF THE VEHICLE WHEN YOU START IT & ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE-ESPECIALLY WHEN THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SITTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.    3.

FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ONLINE, THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT IS AFFECTING THE MAJORITY OF CHRYSLER'S MAKE AND MODELS OF VEHICLES THAT USE THIS ASSEMBLY. THIS IS NOT CONFINED TO JEEP VEHICLES ONLY. THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC AND IS SEATED RIGHT ON TOP OF THE ENGINE BLOCK. THE SEAL IS KEPT BY 3 OR 4 O-RINGS THAT WARP WHEN EXPOSED TO THE HEAT OF THE ENGINE AND THEN LEAK OIL INTO THE EXTERIOR VALLEY THAT IS CREATED BY THE PISTON CAVITIES. THIS IS A BIG RISK OF ENGINE OIL FLAME UP AND TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE ENGINE. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, THE VALLEY IN THE ENGINE CAN HOLD ONTO ABOUT 2 QUARTS OF OIL BEFORE IT STARTS TO LEAK AND IS NOTICEABLE. THIS IS A DANGER FOR DRIVERS THAT DON'T KNOW THEY ARE RUNNING LOW ON OIL AND THEIR ENGINES COULD SEIZE UP AS A RESULT. NOW I KNOW WHY MY CAR HAD JUST SHY OF 5 QUARTS OF OIL IN IT WHEN I CHANGED THE OIL AND MY CAR HOLDS 6 QUARTS TO JUST BE IN THE SAFE ZONE ON MY DIPSTICK.

RECENT SECOND OCCURRENCE AT 60K MILES ON NEW MOTOR DEALERSHIP HAS NOW HAD VEHICLE FOR OVER 2 MONTHS. NOW TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR HIGH PRESSURE DIESEL PUMP THEY REPLACED, CAR STILL NOT RUNNING. PLAN TO REPLACE ALL VALVES, WILL IT RUN? INITIALLY IT HAD SHOWN SO MANY CODES THEY COULDN'T DETERMINE WHY THE CAR FAILED. NHTSA HAS OVER 130 COMPLAINTS ON THIS MOTOR. JEEP FIAT CHRYSLER AWAITING GOVT. TO SIGN OFF ON EMISSIONS SCANDAL SETTLEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO NOT HAVE TO BUY BACK THIS VEHICLE, UNLIKE VOLKSWAGEN WHO DID THE RIGHT THING FOR SAME ISSUE AND BOUGHT BACK. UNLIKE VOLKSWAGEN THIS VEHICLE HAS MULTIPLE DOCUMENTED DEFECTS AND SAFETY ISSUES. I AM BEING STONEWALLED BY JEEP FOR RESOLUTION. SINCE MY PURCHASE OF THIS JEEP IN 10/2014 IT HAS BEEN IN FOR REPAIRS UNRELATED TO NORMAL USE MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT, OVER 7 MONTHS IN SHOP WHILE I AM PAYING ON IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO USE IT. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FOR RELIABILITY, IT HAS FAILED THAT TEST OVER TIME. THEY COULD AGAIN REPLACE THE MOTOR AND I DO NOT WANT THE VEHICLE BACK, I WILL NOT AGAIN RISK BEING STRANDED ON THE HIGHWAY, ENGINE NEARLY ON FIRE AFTER SHAKING, KNOCKING, ROCKING, AND SMOKING NOT ABLE TO TURN OFF UNTIL IT DIES. I REFUSE TO RESELL IT TO SOME UNKNOWING UNSUSPECTING PERSON THAT WILL END UP WITH A LEMON IF THE DEALER GETS IT RUNNING. THIS JEEP NEEDS TO BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE! JEEP AND THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO STOP DEFRAUDING CONSUMERS AND MAKING MILLIONS ON A DEFECTIVE LEMON. I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MANY ISSUES WITH A VEHICLE IN MY LIFE. HELP!!!",

SO BECAUSE JEEP DIDN'T WANT TO ACCOUNT FOR A SMALL DEDUCTION IN THEIR 1.6 BILLION DOLLARS IN PRE-TAX ANNUAL PROFITS, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I HAVE HAD TO SUFFER INSTEAD. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ACCIDENT AND JUST IMAGINE IF I WERE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN IT DEPLOYED AND STRUCK ME I WOULD BE A DEAD MAN FOR SURE AND THERE MAY BE OTHERS AS WELL. WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONCERN FOR VEHICLE OWNERS? THOSE ARE CONVENIENCES THAT ARE PRIORITIZE FAR DOWN THE LIST; BEHIND MONEY, PROFIT, STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE GREED!!

I KNOW WE DIDN'T BREAK THE SHIFTER AND IT HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF A DEFECT. IT'S NOW COSTING US $1400.00 TO FIX. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THIS WOULD HAVE DONE IF IT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE DRIVING.",

I FEAR NOW THAT WHEN I'M DRIVING THAT THE DRIVER SIDE HEADREST  COULD MALFUNCTION AND  EXPLODE AT THE BACK OF MY HEAD  RESULTING IN SERIOUS INJURIES. IVE TALKED TO OTHER JEEP OWNERS WITH THE SAME STYLE VEHICLE AND NONE OF THEM WERE AWARE OF THIS 'SAFETY FEATURE' WITH THE HEADREST. AND NOT ONE SINGLE MENTION IN THE OWNERS MANUAL ABOUT THIS DEPLOYING HEADREST. PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE!!",

WHILE ON A ROAD TRIP, AN INDICATOR LIGHT FOR \"POWER STEERING SERVICE NEEDED\" CAME ON SUDDENLY JUST BEFORE I WAS ABOUT TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY. I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY AT AN AUTOPARTS STORE. WE CHECKED THE POWER STEERING FLUID RESERVOIR AND IT WAS EMPTY. WE ADDED POWER STEERING FLUID BUT IT WOULD NOT BLEED INTO THE SYSTEM. AT THAT POINT, THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO STEER AT LOWER SPEEDS. IT SEEMS UNUSUAL FOR THE POWER STEERING TO GO OUT SUDDENLY WITH VERY LITTLE WARNING.    WE TOOK IT TO THE SHOP AND LEARNED THAT THE POWER STEERING GEAR BOX WAS LEAKING AND HAD TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED. ADDITIONALLY, THE POWER STEERING MODULE ASSEMBLY FAILED AT THE SAME TIME AND ALSO HAD TO BE REPLACED (ALONG WITH THE POWER STEERING PUMP TOO SINCE THAT IS NOT SOLD SEPARATELY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN WORKING ORDER). ALL IN ALL, WE ENDED UP PAYING CLOSE TO $3,000 FOR REPLACING BASICALLY THE ENTIRE THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM ON A 4 YEAR OLD VEHICLE. IN MY 30 YEARS OF DRIVING, I HAVE NEVER HAD A NEWER CAR HAVE SUCH A BIG FAILURE OF A CRITICAL SAFETY SYSTEM AND WITH VERY LITTLE WARNING. I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER  AND WAS NOT ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING WHEN IT HAPPENED OR WE COULD HAVE CRASHED.    I DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH AND HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE OTHER STEERING SYSTEM COMPLAINTS (LEAKAGES AND FAILURES AT VERY LOW MILEAGES) FROM 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE OWNERS. I BELIEVE THE POWER STEERING GEAR BOX DESIGN IS FAULTY FOR IT TO LEAK SO SUDDENLY AND QUICKLY. THE REPAIR PERSON TOLD ME IT SHOULD NOT LEAK AND THAT IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED VERY SUDDENLY.

I POINT OUT THAT THE VEHICLE IS USED IN THE STYLE OF MIXED DRIVING, EVERY DAY TRAVELING IN THE CITY BUT ALSO RUNS DAILY ROUTES ON THE HIGHWAY SO I ASSUME THAT THE REGENERATION OF FAP TAKES PLACE CORRECTLY. THE USE OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT HEAVY. THE VEHICLE IS ALWAYS RECOVERED AT NIGHT IN THE BOXG (THE TEMPERATURE DOES NOT FALL BELOW 0 DEGREES) AND THEREFORE IS NOT EXPOSED TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. PLEASE CHECK THAT THERE ARE NO RECALL ACTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ANOMALY, I REQUEST THAT THE WORKSHOP BE SUPPORTED BY A SECOND TECHNICAL LEVEL TO ALLOW THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM AND AVOID THE REPLACEMENT OF UNNECESSARY PARTS",

THE VOLUME TO THE RADIO WORKS FINE SOME DAYS, OTHER DAYS, WE CANNOT GET THE VOLUME TO WORK ON THE RADIO AT ALL...OR WORSE, SOMETIMES IT WILL LET US TURN THE VOLUME UP SOME AND THEN WE CANNOT GET IT TO TURN BACK DOWN (CAUSING ISSUES WHEN I NEED TO HEAR THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE) UNTIL WE POWER THE IGNITION DOWN. IT HAS AFFECTED THE NAVIGATION AND SPEAKERS TO SOME DEGREE ALREADY AND WE HAVE TAKEN IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT WITH NO RESOLUTION.  THEY HAVE TOLD US THEY TRIED A \"FLASH UPDATE\" BUT IT STILL HAS NOT HELPED.  WE CONSTANTLY GET AN ERROR MESSAGE STATING \"VEHICLE PHONE NEEDS SERVICE\".  I DID SOME RESEARCH AFTER OUR LAST SERVICE APPOINTMENT AND REALIZED THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE RADIO'S FOR THIS MODEL AND YEAR JEEP FOR THE SAME ISSUES WE ARE HAVING BUT, I DO NOT SEE OUR VIN # LISTED IN THE RECALL.

UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION BY THE REPAIR TECHNICIAN THAT'S WHAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I ASKED IF THEY REPLACE THE EVAPORATOR WITH THE SAME PART AND HE SAID NO, THEY NOW USE A DIFFERENT SKU REPLACEMENT EVAPORATOR. OBVIOUSLY, JEEP IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS MADE CHANGES TO FIX IT. HOWEVER, IN MY CASE JEEP WON'T PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT SAYING MY VEHICLE WITH 45,000 MILES IS PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD. IT'S MY POSITION THAT JEEP USED A DEFECTIVE EVAPORATOR IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT'S ONLY MY BAD LUCK THAT IT DID NOT START LEAKING FREON SOONER. APPARENTLY THE EVAPORATOR IS NOT *THAT* EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS LOCATED IN A DIFFICULT LOCATION TO GET TO, BEHIND THE DASHBOARD, AND THAT MAKES IT AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR ($1,680).

JUST THE PART TO FIX IT COST AROUND $ 500.00 PLUS THE LABOR AT $250.00 THIS IS A NEW IDEA FROM JEEP NOT TO HAVE A GAS CAP FOR THE FUEL NECK. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL BY JEEP SINCE THEIR NEW IDEA DOES NOT WORK. 2014 WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT JEEP DOSN'T HAVE A GAS CAP. JUST THINK, I INVESTED $42000.00 IN MY JEEP WITH ONLY 41000 MILES ON IT AND I CANT GET A VA. INSPECTION STICKER ON IT WITHOUT SPENDING ANOTHER $750.00 ON IT, JUST BECAUSE THEIR NEW IDEA DOESN'T WORK.

FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, I WENT TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH A SERVICE ADVISOR WHO CHECKED FOR ERROR CODES (THERE WERE NONE) AND EXPLAINED THAT THIS MODEL AND YEAR OF JEEP HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE ACTIVE BRAKING FEATURE, STATING THAT KEEPING THE CAMERA CLEAN CAN HELP, AND HE PROCEEDED TO CLEAN MY CAMERA. BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE, I DID NOT LEAVE MY VEHICLE FOR FURTHER INSPECTION. AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT, MY NOT YET NINE MONTH OLD SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME, SO TO AVOID ANY SAFETY CONCERNS SURROUNDING THIS BRAKING FEATURE, I TURNED THE ACTIVE BRAKING SETTING OFF IN MY CAR TO DISABLE THE FEATURE. THE FEATURE HAS REMAINED OFF SINCE THAT TIME. HOWEVER ON 1/9/17 I WAS STOPPED IN TRAFFIC AT A RED SIGNAL. THE LIGHT CHANGED TO GREEN SO I PROCEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD. THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME HESITATED IN MOVING FORWARD, SO I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS. BEFORE I HAD THE CHANCE TO USE THE BRAKE, THE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM WENT OFF AND THE ACTIVE BREAKING FEATURE ENGAGED. I WAS SHOCKED, TO SAY THE LEAST. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND CHECKED MY VEHICLE SETTINGS. THE FEATURE WAS SUPPOSEDLY STILL TURNED OFF. AT THIS POINT I WAS EXTREMELY WORRIED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY NOW 1.5 YEAR OLD SON WHO WAS ONCE AGAIN WITH ME, SO I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION. THE DEALERSHIP WAS UNABLE TO RECREATE THE ISSUE, AND THEREFORE NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS IT. I HAD PREVIOUSLY COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE ONE OF THE VERY USEFUL SAFETY FEATURES OF MY VEHICLE DUE TO ITS KNOWN MALFUNCTION, HOWEVER NOW I AM AT A LOSS AS I AM CLEARLY UNABLE TO DISABLE THE FEATURE AND HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING THAT IT WILL NOT ENGAGE ANYWAY.",

I HAVE TAKEN IT TO A DEALER AND HE CHECKED THE UNIT OUT AT FIRST HE SAID THE POWER BOOSTER WAS BAD THEN AFTER TALKING TO JEEP THEY CHANGED THEIR STORY. HE CLAIMS THE ROTORS AND PADS ARE SHOT!  I AM  PRETTY GOOD AT WORKING ON CARS AND TRUCKS. I KNOW FOR A FACT THE ROTORS AND PADS ARE NOT GONE! I HAVE HAD A FEW GARAGES LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAID THE SAME. SOMETHING IS STOPPING THE BRAKE PRESSURE ON THE REAR BRAKES AND ONLY WORKING PARTIALLY ON THE FRONT. I ASK ABOUT RECALL P14 AND N58. THEY SAID NOTHING! THAT IS THE LOSS OF PRESSURE FROM MASTER CYLINDER FROM MOISTURE. AT PRESENT TIME I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE UNIT BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY MISSED 2 STOP LIGHTS BECAUSE OF POOR BRAKING ABILITY I WAS ONLY DOING 50 ON A 4 LANE DIVIDED HIGHWAY AND COULD NOT BRING IT TO A FULL STOP BEFORE THE LIGHT.

HERE IS WHY:  I HAVE HAD THE SITUATION, WHERE I PULL MY CAR INTO MY GARAGE WHICH IS ON A SLIGHT INCLINE.  MY KIDS JUMP OUT OF THE CAR, AND WALK AROUND THE BACK TO GET INTO THE HOUSE.  AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO GATHER UP, SO I AM NOT AS QUICK TO EXIT THE CAR AS THEY ARE.  KIDS ARE BEHIND THE CAR AND I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND THE CAR STARTS ROLLING BACKWARD WHILE THE KIDS ARE BEHIND IT.  IT IS ONLY BY EXTREME LUCK THAT I DID NOT KILL BOTH MY CHILDREN.  I WOULD LIKE TO ADD, THAT EVEN THOUGH I AM PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION WITH THE SHIFTER, AND I AM EXTREMELY DILIGENT, YOU CAN BECOME DISTRACTED AND FORGET.  FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE SENT MESSAGES TO CHRYSLER (SPECIFICALLY, WHEN THEY SENT THEIR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY AFTER I FIRST RECEIVED THE CAR) THAT MENTIONS THIS AS A PROBLEM.  I HAVE BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER'S ATTENTION.    NO RESPONSE.  THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.

PLEASE REQUIRE THEM TO MAKE A BETTER FIX AND TO CALL EACH AND EVERY JEEP OWNER AND VERBALLY DESCRIBE THIS ISSUE.  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T READ THEIR MAIL, WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH ETC.   THEIR FIX IS NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

WHEN I DID, THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL ROLLED OVER MY RIGHT LEG.  MY LEG MUST HAVE BEEN IN A FOLDED POSITION.  THE WHEEL ROLLED ONTO THE INNER-UPPER PART OF MY LOWER LEG, MISSING THE KNEE, AND OFF THE OUTER-LOWER PART OF MY UPPER LEG.  THE PAIN SET IN.  I WAS ABLE TO GET UP, CHASE DOWN THE VEHICLE, GET IN, AND STOP IT BEFORE IT CRASHED INTO ANYTHING.  I SAT IN THE VEHICLE FOR A WHILE UNTIL SOME OF THE PAIN SUBSIDED A BIT, DROVE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PLACE AT THE POST OFFICE AND PARKED IT.  I LOST THE LETTER I WAS MAILING AND SEARCHED FOR IT.  I WENT HOME,  TOOK THREE ASPIRIN AND A SHOT OF WHISKEY, AND WATCHED TELEVISION FOR A WHILE UNTIL I COULD SLEEP.  THE NEXT DAY AT THE OFFICE, MY ASSISTANT NAMED THE VEHICLE \"CHRISTINE\".

WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE, ON MANY OCCASIONS, IT WOULD NOT SHIFT OR WILL ACT LIKE ITS TRYING TO BRAKE. HARSH SHIFTING WOULD OCCUR WHEN PUTTING THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE OR REVERSE AND UPON STEPPING ON THE PEDAL THE VEHICLE WILL SLAM INTO GEAR. THERE ARE ALSO MANY INSTANCES WHERE THE VEHICLE WILL SKIP GEARS, STAY STUCK IN A GEAR, AND THE WORST SITUATION IS WHEN THE VEHICLE HAS SHUT ITSELF DOWN OR PUT ITSELF INTO 2ND GEAR AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OF THAT GEAR AFTER KEY ON/OFF. THIS LAST SITUATION COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS INCIDENT IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP OVER 7 TIMES AND EACH TIME THEY \"RELEARNED\" THE SOFTWARE, PERFORMED OTHER FCA \"ACCEPTABLE\" REPAIRS, REPLACED COMPONENTS AND TOLD US IT WAS FIXED. EACH TIME THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SUPPOSEDLY \"REPAIRED\" AND RETURNED TO ME IT HAS FAILED AGAIN. THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCES RESULTED IN THE VEHICLE NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO BE DRIVEN SINCE THE GEAR SELECTOR WOULD JUST SLIDE FREELY BACK AND FORTH THROUGH ALL RANGES WITHOUT EVER ENGAGING; THESE 2 INSTANCES THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE PICKED UP AND TOWED TO THE SERVICE REPAIR SHOP. I FEEL FCA IS TAKING A CHANCE WITH MY AND MY FAMILIES LIFE AND HAVE OFFERED ME A SMALL MONETARY SETTLEMENT TO CONSIDER MY ISSUE RESOLVED. I FIND THIS INSULTING THAT THIS IS THE VALUE THEY HAVE PLACED ON LIFE AND FRANKLY THE FACT IS I DO NOT TRUST THIS VEHICLE TO BE DRIVING IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE I AM GETTING THE PERSONAL ENJOYMENT AND FULL USE OF MY VEHICLE SINCE THERE IS AN UNDERLYING FEAR THAT IT COULD HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN A FREEWAY AT 70 MPH.

ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TESTED IT FOR ME AND AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THE ALTERNATOR IS NOT CHARGING THE BATTERY TO THE CORRECT LEVEL.  I THEN HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED BACK TO DEALER.  IT'S AT THE DEALER NOW.  FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT, THEN THEY REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AGAIN AND IT STILL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEY ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE WIRING AND WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR IT AND THEY CLAIM IT ISN'T RELATED (ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS REALLY THE ISSUE).  IT ALL SEEMS VERY RELATED TO ME.

THE JEEP ROLLED OFF THE DRIVEWAY INTO A TREE. THANK GOD NO ONE WAS IN THE WAY AND MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT IN THE CAR. I GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND FOUND THAT IT WAS IN REVERSE, NOT PARK! THE FONT BUMPER WAS DISLODGED AND SMASHED. I HAD BEEN HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE GETTING THE ELECTRON GEAR SELECTOR TO CHOOSE THE CORRECT GEAR SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR. 50% OF THE TIME I WOULD DISCOVER THAT I WAS IN REVERSE WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS IN PARK. THERE IS VERY LITTLE CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TWO GEARS, NOTHING DEFINITIVE LIKE THERE IS ON A SLIDE TRACK IN MOST CARS WITH A DEFINITIVE CLUNK WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO PARK. THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE WAS TO LOOK DOWN AT THE GEAR SHIFT TO SEE THE LIGHT INDICATOR. I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL MY 59 YEAR OLD LIFE AND HAVE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT. I WAS SO UPSET AND FRUSTRATED WITH THE GEAR SHIFT THAT I TOOK IT BACK AND ORDERED A 2013 JEEP WITH THE OLD GEAR SHIFT ON A TRACK SYSTEM. I'D HAD IT!  IF THEY DON'T CHANGE THE GEAR SYSTEM IN THE NEXT JEEP, I WILL HAVE TO BUY A DIFFERENT MAKE. THE PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH MAY HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF DEFECT IN THE ELECTRONIC GEAR SHIFT, IS, IN MY OPINION, NOT A DEFECT, SO NATURALLY CHRYSLER WILL NOT FIND ANY DEFECTS. I THINK IT IS POOR DESIGN AND A HAZARD. IT IS A HUMAN INTERFACE PROBLEM. PARK SHOULD NOT BE SO CLOSE TO REVERSE. THE GEAR SHIFT ONLY MOVES ABOUT A 1/4 INCH ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. YOU CAN NOT DEPEND ON FEEL TO TELL WHICH GEAR YOU ARE IN, WHICH YOU CAN WHEN YOU HAVE A CAR WITH A SLIDE TRACK GEAR SHIFT. ALSO, ANOTHER INCIDENT:  I WAS MAKING A LEFT AND HAD TO BREAK HARD FOR A SEC, MY PURSE MOVED FORWARD AND EASILY PUSHED THE GEAR INTO NEUTRAL WHEN I NEEDED TO BE IN GEAR FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

THESE CONDITIONS CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO GO INTO A VERY SLOW DRIVING CONDITION (I.E. 5MPH) ON A TWO (2) LANE HIGHWAY CAUSING A TRAFFIC JAM BEHIND US AND A DANGEROUS SITUATION SINCE TURNOUT LANES WERE INFREQUENT.  WHEN OPENING THE HOOD, IT APPEARED THAT THE COOLANT HAD SPRAYED OUT OF THE RESERVOIR THROUGH THE CAP AND ONTO THE ENGINE.  WE ATTEMPTED TO COOL THE ENGINE DOWN OVER A TWO (2) HOUR PERIOD AND ADDED OVER 1.5 GALLONS OF A WATER/COOLANT MIXTURE HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE STILL OVERHEATED AND HAD THE ENGINE OIL REACH OVER 300 DEGREES UNTIL WE COULD PARK IT FOR SEVERAL MORE HOURS.

I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH POTENTIALLY TROUBLED ROADWAYS, HOWEVER THIS WAS INTERSTATE 15 IN SAN DIEGO, AND WITHIN SEPARATED CARPOOL LANES. AS I CONTINUED ON CAUTIOUSLY AT ROUGHLY 60MPH DUE TO CONDITIONS AND UNSURE OF THE FIRST OCCURRENCE, I FELT THE CAR SLIP, AND SLIDE, THE REAR END STARTING TO DRIFT TOWARD EDGE OF LANE, I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM GAS AND ALLOWED CAR TO REGAIN TRACTION.  WAS FORCED TO CRAWL AT ROUGHLY 45MPH TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN.  A NATIVE OF OREGON WHERE RAIN IS A ROUTINE PART OF LIFE, THIS OCCURRENCE FALLS BEYOND THE REALM OF EXPECTED PERFORMANCE.  THE GRAND CHEROKEE IS ONE OF THE HEAVIEST CARS ON THE ROAD, MAKING THIS ISSUE PERPLEXING.  AT THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS EXPERIENCING MODERATE RAIN THROUGHOUT THE MONTH DISPELLING MUCH CREDIT FOR OIL ACCUMULATION ON THE ROADWAYS, AS IS USUALLY INDICATED.  WHEN I CAME TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE I REMEMBERED A FEW WEEKS PRIOR ON A WET ROADWAY (NOT RAINING) AS I ACCELERATED FROM A RED LIGHT MY REAR TIRES SPUN, AND I HAD TO RELEASE THE GAS TO REGAIN TRACTION AS WELL.  THE REASON I AM REPORTING IS I BROUGHT THIS SCARY INCIDENT UP TO A FRIEND WHO ALSO OWNED A NEWER GRAND CHEROKEE (2013), AND WAS APPALLED TO HEAR OF SIMILAR OCCURRENCES. THIS HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED MY TRUST IN THE VEHICLE. MY OWN STEPS WERE TO UPGRADE TIRES WHICH ARE FALKEN ZIEX S/TZ05 SIDE 285/40R22XL 110H, TO YOKOHAMA OF THE SAME SIZE, AND REPORT TO DEALER.  HOWEVER I AM SKEPTICAL THIS WOULD BE A FIX, AS THE FALKEN TREAD (JUST 4,000MILES INTO USE) LOOKS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF DISPERSING WATER.  WITH INFREQUENT RAIN, IT MAY BE QUITE SOME TIME BEFORE CONDITIONS REPEAT THEMSELVES, AND I WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE GETTING UP TO (AGAIN 60MPH) MODERATE SPEEDS.   *TR",

THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I DROVE INTO A SLOPED DRIVEWAY.  I PUT THE CAR INTO PARK, TURNED OFF THE CAR, AND SAT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT TO COMPOSE AN E-MAIL.  MY FOOT CONTINUED TO BE ON THE BRAKE.  A MINUTE OR SO LATER, WHEN I COMPLETED MY TASK, I OPENED THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO GET OUT, HAVING NOT PUT ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  AS IT WAS A GENTLE SLOPE, I DID NOT NOTICE THE CAR BEGINNING TO ROLL IMMEDIATELY, BUT ONCE OUTSIDE THE CAR I REALIZED IT WAS ROLLING BACKWARDS.  I TURNED AND GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, ALMOST FALLING IN THE PROCESS.  AT THE TIME I THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT HAVE PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL RATHER THAN PARK, AS THE GEAR SHIFT IS ELECTRONIC, AND IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN FEEL FROM OLDER TRANSMISSIONS.  BELIEVING THAT IT WAS MY ERROR, I DID NOTHING ABOUT THIS.    THEN, OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND IT HAPPENED AGAIN, AND I WROTE TO JEEP VIA THEIR OWNER PORTAL, TO ENSURE THAT IT WAS REPORTED.  ON DECEMBER 3RD, I SCHEDULED A SERVICE FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 5TH.      YESTERDAY, DECEMBER 4TH, I TOOK THE CAR TO A CAR WASH.  THE ATTENDANT WAS DOING DETAIL WORK, AND AFTER TAKING IT THROUGH THE WASH, HE PARKED IT.  I WALKED TOWARD THE CAR, AND HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR ONCE HE HAD PUT IT INTO PARK AND TURNED IT OFF.  HE EXITED JUST AS I GOT TO THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE CORNER. THE CAR BEGAN TO ROLL AGAIN, AND WAS ON A SLOPE.

I STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH THE CAR IN AUGUST... AND WHEN I SAY ISSUES, I DON'T MEAN THE RADIO BLITZING OUT. THE CAR TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4 WAY INTERSECTION AND WOULDN'T RESTART FOR 3-4 ATTEMPTS!!!! TERRIFIED I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO SAID IT REGISTERED SOME CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODES BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND WHY IT DID THAT. THEY TURNED THE LIGHT OFF AND HAD ME PICK THE CAR UP. AFTER REPEATING THE SAME THING,  ABOUT 8-10 MORE TIMES THE CAR JUST SHUTTING OFF AND GOING BACK INTO THE SHOP A SECOND AND THIRD TIME THEY NOW SAID OH WE FIGURED OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND ITS FIXED. I WAS THRILLED FOR THIS TO BE OVER! A COUPLE WEEKS LATER I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY GOING 65 MPH WITH NO CARS AROUND ME OR INSIGHT. ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE CAR DASHBOARD SAID BRAKE!!! AND THE CAR APPLIED THE ABS BRAKES AND ABRUPTLY SLOWED THE CAR DOWN TO 40 MPH!!!! I WAS SO SCARED AT THAT POINT, TO TOP IT OFF THE CAR AGAIN SHUT OFF AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BACK ON. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE 4TH TIME WHERE THEY NOW HAVE PUT ME IN A RENTAL FOR 40 DAYS. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD MY CAR REGISTERED 57 CODES BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIX OR DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN WHEN I WAS ASKED TO PICK THE CAR UP. I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THAT CAR AND I HAVE LOST FAITH IN THAT VEHICLE. I ASKED THAT THEY BUY THE CAR BACK SINCE IT LEGALLY FALLS UNDER THE LEMON LAW AND THEY REFUSED. THEY LEFT ME NO CHOICE BUT TO HIRE A LEMON LAW ATTORNEY. I NOW HAVE LOST FAITH IN JEEP/CHRYSLER FOR THE WAY THEY ARE HANDLING THIS. THEY WOULD RATHER PUT MYSELF AND OTHERS IN HARMS WAY THAN TO DO THE RIGHT THING.     [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

MY FAMILY AND I WHERE PUT IN GREAT DANGER BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.

THE THIRD OCCURRENCE WAS WHEN WE ENTERED THE HIGHWAY WITH THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF 70 MPH, THE JEEP WOULD NOT ACCELERATE FASTER THAN 38 MPH.  AGAIN MY FAMILY WAS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER BECAUSE OF THE HILLY TERRAIN AND THE TRAFFIC RUNNING UP ON US AT 70 MPH.  WE FOUND OURSELVES HAVING TO PARK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD PLACING OURSELVES IN ANOTHER DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT.  THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY ENGAGE PROPERLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE JEEP TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  THE JEEP HAD ALREADY BEEN IN THE SHOP TWICE FOR THE FRONT DRIVE AXLE.  THE SECOND TIME IT WAS IN THE SHOP, THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO CHECK OUT THE TRANSMISSION TO CORRECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME THE JEEP STOPPED RUNNING DOWN THE HIGHWAY.

WE WERE HEARING A WATER SLOSHING SOUND THAT WAS PROFOUND UPON STARTING FROM A DEAD STOP AND THEN COMING TO A STOP SIGN.

WE WALKED TO THE VEHICLE AND HE OPENED THE PASSENGER DOOR AND MOVED THE PASSENGER SEAT ALL THE WAY FORWARD.  THEN HE OPENED THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR, TOOK OUT THE FLOOR MATS AND OPENED THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT THAT IS LOCATED \"INSIDE\" THE VEHICLE UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT.   THERE WAS WATER POOLED AROUND THE BATTERY AND 4 INCHES FROM REACHING THE + AND - TERMINALS.   THE SERVICE MANAGER WENT UNDER THE VEHICLE AND REMOVED THE PLASTIC PLUG THE SIZE OF A QUARTER.

ON MONDAY, AUGUST 19TH, AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 P.M. AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AFTER HAVING JUST LEFT MY JOB AT THE WASHINGTON COUNTY SHERIFF' OFFICE, WHERE I AM THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, MY VEHICLE'S SCREEN FLASHED A WARNING THAT READ: VEHICLE GEAR SHIFT MALFUNCTION.  THE SCREEN WENT COMPLETELY BLACK FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE.  WHEN IT CAME BACK ON THE SCREEN READ: PLEASE SERVICE TRANSMISSION FOLLOWED BY TURN OFF IGNITION TO ENGAGE PARK.  I TRIED TO TURN OFF IGNITION, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY, AND THE WARNING THEN READ: VEHICLE MUST BE IN PARK TO TURN OFF IGNITION.  THIS ENDLESS CIRCLE CONTINUED AS I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR AT A GAS STATION PARKING LOT.  I SAT IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE GAS STATION FOR APPROXIMATELY 5-7 MINUTES WHERE I DOCUMENTED (VIA CELLPHONE CAMERA) THE REPEATED MESSAGES AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN MY ENGINE OFF AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK.  THE GEARS WOULD NOT DISPLAY.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO SEE IF THE VEHICLE WAS IN PARK, OR WHAT GEAR IT WAS IN AT ALL.  AFTER STRUGGLING WITH THE VEHICLE FOR CLOSE TO 7 MINUTES, I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF.  WHEN I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE, THE TRANSMISSION SERVICE LIGHT WAS ON.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP (AS NOTED ABOVE) IMMEDIATELY.  I WAS ASSURED BY THE SALESMAN THAT THIS \"HAPPENS ALL THE TIME TO JEEPS\".  THIS WAS MY FIRST MAJOR CONCERN WITH NOT ONLY THE VEHICLE, BUT ALSO THE DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE A FULL TEAM OF CERTIFIED MECHANICS THAT WORK FOR OUR OFFICE.  I MET WITH EACH OF THEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOT A COMMON THING FOR ANY VEHICLE.    MY CRUISE CONTROL IS NOW COMPLETELY INOPERABLE.  *TR",
