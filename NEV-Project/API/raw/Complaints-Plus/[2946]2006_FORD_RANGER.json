THE NOTICE TOLD ME TO CONTACT MY DEALER, SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT FOR RECALL 18S02 AND THAT THEY WOULD ARRANGE TO HAVE IT PICKED UP OR TOWED. I WAS NOT TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER. THE NOTICE SAID I WOULD BE PROVIDED A LOANER IF NEEDED. I CALLED THE NEAREST FORD DEALER (GREAT LAKES FORD IN MUSKEGON, MI). I WAS TOLD BY THEIR EMPLOYEE TO CONTACT EAGLE TOWING AND HAVE MY CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHICH I DID. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP (AFTER THEY WERE CLOSED) AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER DEMANDED I PAY HIM AND GET REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE DEALERSHIP. SINCE THE DEALERSHIP HAD TOLD ME TO USE THIS TOW COMPANY AND THE RECALL NOTICE SAID FORD WOULD PAY FOR IT, I THOUGHT GETTING REIMBURSED WOULD BE EASY. WRONG. AFTER ALMOST A YEAR AND MANY PHONE CALLS, EMAILS AND 1 LETTER TO THE DEALERSHIP I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING. TODAY THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED TO PAY ME HALF OF THE COST I INCURRED TO HAVE THE RANGER TOWED. I REFUSED THEIR OFFER. I BELIEVE IT IS CLEARLY IMMORAL FOR FORD TO TELL ME TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED FOR A REQUIRED RECALL AND THEN REFUSE TO REIMBURSE ME WHEN I DID EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO, BUT I DO NOT KNOW IF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ME IS ILLEGAL. I AM WRITING TO THE NHTSA TO SEE IF THERE ARE APPLICABLE RULES/LAWS REQUIRING THE MANUFACTURER TO HONOR THEIR PROMISE TO MAKE REPAIRS REQUIRED BY THE NHTSA TO MY VEHICLE AT NO COST TO ME THE OWNER. THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN HELPING ME UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS WHICH DOES NOT (TO ME) SEEM TO BE WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD. IF IT IS PERTINENT, THE TOWING COST $185.40 BECAUSE IT IS A SPARSELY POPULATED FARMING COMMUNITY AND THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP WAS OVER 20 MILES AWAY. I DID NOT NEED AND DID NOT REQUEST A LOANER VEHICLE.  *TR",

AFTER READING ABOUT THE CATASTROPHIC ACCOUNTS OF FAILURES FROM MANY OTHER OWNERS, I AM ASTOUNDED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SAFETY RECALL.  ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT DESIGN HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR SOMETIME, AND FORD HAS ADMITTED THEE PARTS MEXICAN AND CHINESE ORIGINS (WHERE COUNTERFEIT PARTS ABOUND).  I WAS LUCKY THAT I DID NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT AS THE WHEEL BEARING STARTED TO CRAB OR CATCH AT WET HIGHWAY SPEEDS.   SEE CARCOMPLAINTS.COM FOR FORD HUB/WHEELBEARING FAILURES, SOME ARE RATHER EXTREME.   I CAREFULLY (AND SLOWLY) TOOK THE TRUCK TO MY REPAIR SHOP, WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED THE LEFT WHEEL WAS EXTREMELY LOOSE (FALLING OFF??) AND THE RIGHT WHEEL WAS LOOSE, BUT NOT AS EXTREME.  AS FORD IS WELL AWARE, THE COST FOR REPLACING BOTH IS $800.  THE REPAIR SHOP MECHANIC SAID THAT THEY SEE A LOT OF THESE (I.E., FORD RANGERS); SOME LESS THAN 50,000 MILES, AND THAT MINE IS NOT AN UNUSUAL CASE FOR THE FORD RANGER, AND I WILL PROBABLY BE BRINGING IT BACK IN ABOUT 40-50,000 MILES TO GET THOSE REPLACED.  IT IS SAD THAT MECHANICS ARE NORMALIZING SUCH A DESIGN DEFICIENCY AS TYPICAL AND EXPECTED PERFORMANCE.  DUE TO THE POOR RESPONSE TO OTHER FORD RANGER (AND EXPLORERS TOO) OWNERS (2000-2006) AND LACK OF FORDS WILLINGNESS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, I WILL MOST LIKELY RETURN TO TOYOTA. ADDITIONALLY, TOYOTA HAS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WANTING TO RESOLVE CUSTOMER PROBLEMS TO REGAIN THEIR TRUST AND WIN THEM BACK AS EVIDENT BY RECENT ISSUES.
