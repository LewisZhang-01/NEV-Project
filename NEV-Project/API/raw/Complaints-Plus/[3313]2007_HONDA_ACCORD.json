Depressed brake and engine RPM went from about 1000 to over 3000 RPM. Released brake for a sec and tapped accelerator. RPM went back down and brakes returned to normal. I thought that loose carpet on mat may have interfered with accelerator and I removed it.  About 5 hr later I was travelling for about 20 min on 55 mph highway and approached a red light. I depressed brake and slowed down to 5-10 mph. Engine rpm again went up to 3000-4000 RPM, I put automatic transmission in neutral tapped accelerator and RPM returned to idle 800.   This again occurred for 5 more times before I returned home. When I pulled into my drive way I slowly reached the end and put the car in park, set the emergency brake, and let it idle for about 30 sec. I then depressed the brake a little and the RPM increased from 800 to just over 1000. I then depressed the brake harder and the RPM shot up to about 4000. At no time was the accelerator depressed or moved. I shut off the ignition and attempted to duplicate the error but could not. I also checked all the vacuum lines from the brake booster for leaks. There were no warning lights and a scan did not indicate any trouble codes. I have not brought it to a dealer as I am seeing if I can reproduce and troubleshoot the problem. I am an engineer and have done all my auto service and repairs for close to 50 years. This includes rebuilding engines, transmissions (manual/auto), and electrical troubleshooting. I can assure you this is not due to floor mat interference or incorrect application of pedals.",

YOU COULD SEE THE SUBSTANCE MELTING TO THE GROUND. THE FIRE FIGHTER CALLED THE POLICE AND INVESTIGATED THE FIRE HIMSELF. HE SAID THAT IT WAS SOME TYPE OF WIRING ISSUE AND THE FIRE DEPT.

I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS HONDA AUTOMOBILE DIVISION FAULT AND THAT I NEED TO WAIT AGAIN FOR AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME. I ASK IF I COULD CALL THE PONCE DEALER AND THEY GAVE ME THE NAME OF A PERSON THAT APPARENTLY HANDLES THEIR PART INVENTORY. THAT WAS IT. IN ADDITION THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY APPOINTMENT AT OTHER DEALER OR TO CHANGE THE PART TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AGAIN I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD BE CONTACTED LATER TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT NOTHING MORE. BECAUSE OF THIS I DECIDED TO MAKE A COMPLAINT BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO SUFFER ANY INJURIES WHILE I WAIT BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY AND INCOMPETENCE BY THEIR PART.  *TR",

HIGH-PRESSURE HOSE @ $58,000, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER POWER STEERING PUMP THAT I WAITED TILL 72,000 TO PAY FOR, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER THE RACK & PINION WHICH I PUT OFF TILL 93,000 DUE TO THE COST AND HOW MUCH ALL OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS WERE COSTING ME. TODAY THE CAR HAS 104,000. I HAD ALL WORK DONE BY HONDA UP TO 85,000, BUT HAVE TRIED TO SAVE MONEY AND HAVE HAD SOMEONE ELSE DO THE RACK & PINION AND A FEW OTHER COSTLY ITEMS SINCE. I WENT BACK TO HONDA TODAY FOR THEIR OPINION - NET RESULT - ALL OF THE ABOVE ITEMS HAVE A BAD LEAK AND NEED TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN - $2400 COST!  THE OTHER THING I WANT TO ADD IS THE RECALL ON HONDA ACCORDS \"HIGH PRESSURE POWER STEERING HOSE\" - OF COURSE, THE RECALL WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I'D ALREADY PAID FOR THE SERVICE - MY CAR'S HOSE WENT BAD & NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR THE SAME REASON AS WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER HONDAS WERE UNDER RECALL FOR (THE HEAT OF THE ENGINE CAUSED IT TO MELT). WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE RECALL I ANTICIPATED RECEIVING A LETTER IN THE MAIL BUT NEVER DID - THE REASON WAS THAT THE RECALL FOR THE HOSE WAS FOR MANY OTHER MODEL YEARS NOT INCLUDING 2007 (MY CAR YEAR).  *TR",

THEY STATED THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE TUNE-UP, BUT SHOULD BE DONE WITH A TUNE-UP.  I PAID FOR A FUEL FLUSH.  THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND INQUIRED IF THEY HAD CHANGES ALL SIX OF MY PLUGS AND WIRES.  THEY SAID YES...I ASKED WHY WAS I STILL HAVING THIS ISSUE AFTER GETTING A TUNE-UP.  I WAS ASKED THE GRADE OF GAS I USE.  I TOLD THE SERVICE TECH 87, THAT IS WHAT THE MANUAL RECOMMENDED.  I WAS TOLD TO TRY 93 GRADE FOR ABOUT A MONTH TO SEE IF THAT WILL FILTER AND CLEAN THE LINES.  I DID... HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM STILL OCCURS BUT NOT AS BAD.  I CALL AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR SATURDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING. I'M NOW BEING TOLD MY TRANSMISSION IS GOING BAD (TORQUE CONVERTER).  I SAID THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.  A 2007 VEHICLE WITH ONLY 117,000 MILE AND MY TRANSMISSION IS GOING OUT.  WHILE SITTING IN THE CUSTOMER WAITING AREA, A GENTLEMEN WITH THE SAME IDENTICAL VEHICLE AS MINE TOLD ME HE HAD MORE MILE ON HIS VEHICLE THAN MINES, BUT HIS TRANSMISSION WENT OUT ALSO AND HE HAD TO HAVE HIS REBUILT FOR AROUND $2,000.00.  I SAID THERE IS NO WAY TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE GOING OUT ON A 2007 MODEL VEHICLE WITH ONLY 117,000 MILES.  HONDA NEED TO INVESTIGATE IF THIS IS A DEFECT ISSUE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID NO, HONDA DOES NOT HAVE A RECALL ON THE PROBLEM.  SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!  *TR",

I THEN OBSERVED ONLINE THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR V6 MODEL OF 2007 ACCORDS. MINE IS A 4CYL.  HONDA WANTS ABOUT $359 FOR THE REPAIR. THE REPAIR IS FOR THE MASTER CONTROL WINDOW SWITCH.  *TR",

I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE IT IS A RELIABLE CAR, THAT WOULD LAST ME YEARS IF MAINTAINED PROPERLY.  I HAVE HONDA DO MY REGULAR MAINTENANCE, BUT THIS TIME, I COULDN'T AFFORD THEIR OUTRAGEOUS COSTS.  I HAVE UNDER 32000MILES AND MY REAR BRAKES AND ENTIRE A/C SYSTEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPLACED.  SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY (4YEARS OLD NOW) FOR THE A/C THEY SAID SINCE I DID NOT GO TO THEIR DEALERSHIP, IT WAS OUT OF POCKET FOR ME.  OF COURSE THEY TEASE ME AND TELL ME IF I DID PAY THE $60 FOR THE INSPECTION, THEN THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  MY BRAKES DID OCCUR DURING WARRANTY, AND THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE BRAKES AND THAT HAVING THEM WEAR OUT UNDER 20,000MILES IS NORMAL.    THERE IS REALLY NO WAY TO KNOW WHEN THE A/C NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, BUT BECAUSE THEY PUT IN A SMALL RECEIVER DRIER, THE DRIER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED EVERY 15,000-25,000 MILES!!  HONDA DOESN'T TELL YOU THIS, AND IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, YOUR CONDENSER WILL BE DESTROYED, AND YOU RUN THE RISK OF HAVING TO INSTALL A BRAND NEW A/C SYSTEM IN A CAR NOT EVEN 10YEARS OLD!

DUE TO THE NUMBER OF MILES ON THE CAR (69K AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT), IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  EVERYONE FROM THE MECHANIC TO THE DEALER SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE.  HONDA DID END UP PAYING FOR A PERCENTAGE OF THE REPAIR, BUT OUR PORTION WAS STILL AROUND $2500.  THIS WAS OUR FIRST HONDA, WE BOUGHT IT BASED ON REPUTATION AND BECAUSE WE PUT A LOT OF MILES ON CARS.  WE NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AT THREE YEARS OLD.",

WHEN STOPPED FOR A TRAFFIC SIGNAL, CAR BEGAN TO VIBRATE AND SHAKE VIOLENTLY TO A BOOMING BASE NOISE.  THE LEVEL OF SOUND:  LOUDER THAN STANDING BY THE SPEAKERS AT A ROCK CONCERT.  THE VOLUME HURT MY EARS; IT WAS EASILY LOUD ENOUGH TO CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE FOR A PROLONGED EXPOSURE.  I'VE WORKED IN A MACHINE SHOP, AND I KNOW LOUD.  (I ASSUMED SOMEONE WITH A MEGA STEREO AND SUB-WOOFER PULLED UP ALONGSIDE ME.  MY RADIO WAS OFF, AND I HAVE A STOCK SYSTEM, NOT CAPABLE OF THIS MAGNITUDE OF SOUND.)  WHEN I TURNED AT THE LIGHT, MY VEHICLE WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE, AND I REALIZED THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM MY CAR.  THE SOUND WAS DEFINITIVELY FROM SPEAKERS AND AN AMPLIFIED SOUND, NOT A NORMAL ENGINE OR EXHAUST SOUND.   I REVVED THE ENGINE, AND THE SOUND DID NOT CHANGE.  THE SOUND DECREASED SLIGHTLY AS I DROVE, AND THEN RESUMED ITS FORMER LEVEL.  I PULLED INTO A GAS STATION, SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, AND LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND BODY.  I SAW NOTHING.  ON THE WAY HOME, I STOPPED BY A HONDA DEALER, AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR MENTIONED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ANC, OR ELECTRONIC NOISE CANCELLATION, WHICH IS USED TO PRODUCE OPPOSITE SOUND WAVES TO CANCEL OUT ENGINE AND ROAD NOISE, CREATING A QUIET CAB ENVIRONMENT.  I ASKED IF THE SYSTEM HAD THE POWER TO SHAKE THE CAR, AND SHE RESPONDED YES.    I WAS STOPPED AT A LIGHT, SO THE ONLY DANGER WAS TO MY HEARING.  IF THIS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE IN TRAFFIC, THE RESULTS COULD BE DANGEROUS.  THE ONSLAUGHT OF NOISE AND SHAKING WAS JARRING.    THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE AN ELECTRONIC GLITCH, AND THEREFORE VERY HARD TO DIAGNOSE.  I AM PUTTING THIS ON RECORD SO THAT ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCING IT HAS SUPPORTING INCIDENTS. *TR",

A SALESMAN AT ADVANCE AUTO TOLD ME TO CHECK THESE PINS, BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES. I THINK HONDA NEEDS TO STEP FORWARD AND MAKE THIS PROBLEM KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC, SEVERAL HAVE COMPLAINED ON INTERNET WEB SITES ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ON 07 MODELS, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE MANY MORE COMPLAINTS COMING IN ON THE 08 ACCORD MODELS. *TR",

THESE BRAKE ROTORS ARE EXCESSIVELY HOT WITHOUT VIRTUALLY ANY USAGE OF THE BRAKES. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CONDITION FOR ANY CAR. I DO NOT USE MY BRAKES EXCESSIVELY, DRIVE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FREEWAYS, AND GOT OVER 100,000 MILE ON MY PREVIOUS HONDA'S REAR BRAKES.    I TOOK MY CAR TO THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER FOR SERVICE UNDER WARRANTY. WHEN I PULLED IN TO THE SERVICE AREA THE SERVICE PERSON CAME RIGHT OUT. I ASKED HIM TO VERIFY THAT THE ROTORS WERE EXTREMELY HOT. HE DID SO. THE REASON I HAD ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON TO VERIFY THE HOT ROTORS WAS SO THAT HE COULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE ROTORS WERE INDEED HOT BEFORE THE CAR HAD A CHANCE TO COOL DOWN. AFTER 20 MINUTES OR SO THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK THE BRAKES. HE SAID THAT THERE WERE NO HOT SPOTS ON THE ROTORS AND THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. OF COURSE THE ROTORS WERE NOT HOT AFTER COOLING DOWN FOR 20 MINUTES.    THE SERVICE PERSON ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE REAR PADS WERE CLOSE TO NEEDING REPLACEMENT. NEEDING TO REPLACE THE REAR PADS AFTER 33,000 MILE OF FREEWAY DRIVING IS PREMATURE PAD WEAR. THE ONLY REASON FOR PREMATURE PAD WEAR ON MY BRAKES AFTER 33,000 MILES IS DRAGGING BRAKE PADS. BECAUSE THE BRAKES ARE DRAGGING ALL THE TIME IS THE REASON THAT THE ROTORS ARE EXCESSIVELY HOT AND THE REASON THAT THE PADS ARE PREMATURELY WORN. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CONDITION FOR ANY CAR.     BRAKE ROTORS BEING EXCESSIVELY HOT IS A DANGEROUS CONDITION. ROTORS THAT ARE EXCESSIVELY HOT ALL THE TIME WILL LEAD TO PREMATURE BRAKE FADE IN CONDITIONS WHERE THE BRAKES WOULD BE USED A LOT, LIKE DRIVING DOWNHILL MOUNTAIN GRADES.

WE STARTED TO GET BACK ON THE HIGHWAY AND A FEW CAR LENGTHS DOWN THE ROAD REALIZED THAT WE ALSO HAD A FLAT ON THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE.  HONDA SAYS WE RAN OVER SOMETHING THAT CAUSED THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY AND THAT IT WAS AN INSURANCE ISSUE SINCE WE COINCIDENTALLY HAD A FLAT AFTER THE AIRBAGS PARTIALLY DEPLOYED.
