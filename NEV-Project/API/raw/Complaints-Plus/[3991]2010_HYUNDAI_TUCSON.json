It is a sudden and obvious taking over of the steering by the car.  I took it to my mechanic. He told me that he and none of his certified  mechanics  have ever seen this problem, and did not know what was wrong and I should contact Hyundai as perhaps there was a recall or service bulletin on this condition.  I did that, but was told that I would have to bring it there to be diagnosed.  My concern is not so much for my car.   I don't know if I want to spend dealership type money to fix the car.  My concern is the safety of others. My wife was traveling about 20 mph when this happened, and was able to avid hitting another car.  If it happened when she was traveling 60 mph on a four lane highway, it would have been a major disaster.  I felt that I needed to bring the problem to your attention, to possibly protect others.

THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR ANY AMOUNT OF SPILLED SODA TO CAUSE THE PLASTIC SHIFT COVER TO CRUMPLE AND IMPEDE PROPER OPERATION OF THE GEAR SHIFTER.

CAR VIOLENTLY DOWNSHIFTS. TO THE POINT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES.   ACTUALLY SLOWED THE CAR DOWN ENOUGH THAT I PUSHED FORWARD IN THE DRIVERS SEATS, AND THE SEAT BELT TENSIONED UP TO KEEP ME GOING FORWARD.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES. I HAVE ASKED THE DEALER ABOUT THIS, AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO DEFECT, AND THAT IT IS 'NORMAL' BEHAVIOR. BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A CAR THAT SHIFTS THIS HARD AND THIS VIOLENTLY TO MAKE ME WORRY ABOUT CRASHING. *TR",
