THE 4RUNNER HAS NEVER BEEN IN A ACCIDENT. I AM A CERTIFIED MECHANIC WHO PERFORMS SAFETY INSPECTIONS AS I WORK FOR ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY.  IT CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I WAS HEARING AND READING STORIES OF THESE 3RD GENERATION 4RUNNERS HAVE  STABILITY PROBLEMS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RUSTED OUT FRAME SUPPORT BRACKETS THAT HOLD THE CONTROL ARMS IN PLACE FOR THE REAR AXLE. THIS IS A MAIN FRAME COMPONENT , IF THE SUPPORT BRACKET BREAK FREE IT ALLOWS THE AXLE TO WANDER AROUND AS IT'S NOT BEING HELD IN PLACE, CAUSING LOSS OF STEERING STABILITY, IT IS A ROAD HAZARD THAT IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO KILL PEOPLE .

THE BODY ON THE BLAZER IS LITERALLY RUSTED EVERYWHERE HOWEVER,THE INTEGRITY OF THE FRAME IS STILL SOLID   BUT THE FRAME IS RUSTED BADLY !   CONVERSELY, THE BODY ON THE 4RUNNER IS EXCELLENT ESPECIALLY FOR THE YEAR,    HAVING A RUSTED OUT BODY IS A APPEARANCE ISSUE NOT A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE AS IN THE 3RD GENERATION TOYOTA 4RUNNER THAT RESIDE IN THE UPPER MIDWEST.

IS A MAJOR FAILURE FOR TOYOTA AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND SHOULD BE REDEEMED BY COMPANY.  I SEE FROM READING ONLINE BLOGPOSTS THAT I AM 1 OF MANY THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.

TEMPERATURE WAS APPROXIMATELY IN THE IN LOW 50S.  BEFORE THE TIRE FAILUE, I FELT A VIBRATION IN THE VEHICLE FOR A FEW MILES, WHICH GRADUALLY GREW LARGER.  SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF THE CAR CHANGED DRASTICALLY (AS THE TREAD SEPARATED, I PRESUME) AND I HEARD MUCH ROAD NOISE.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THE ROAD HAD CHANGED ITS SURFACE FROM ASPHALT TO SOMETHING MORE NOISY, LIKE A \"CHIP-SEALED\" ROAD SURFACE WITH OIL AND CINDERS, BUT THEN I HEARD MORE NOISE AND A BIT OF SIDEWAYS SHAKING, AND I PULLED OVER.  I NEVER FELT THE CAR PULL SIDEWAYS AT ALL, OR EVEN SLOW DOWN (BUT, THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ON).  WHEN I PULLED OVER, I HAD DRIVEN A GOOD 1/4 MILE OR SO ON THE FAILED TIRE.  I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT LOST AIR PRESSURE, BUT BY THE TIME I GOT OFF THE ROAD, I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS NO TREAD, AND THAT THE REMAINING SURFACE OF THE TIRE HAD BEEN SLICED BY THE RIM, AS IT ROLLED ON THE TIRE ONCE PRESSURE WAS LOST.  I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TIRE FAILURE UNTIL THE PUBLICIZED REPORTS OF SIMILAR FAILURES ON SIMILAR SIZED TIRES OF THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL.  I SUSPECT THE ISSUE WITH THE P235 SIZED FIRESTONE TIRES MAY WELL APPLY TO OTHER SIZES, SUCH AS MY P225 TIRES.
