THE COST IS $1695 THEY SAID THE LIGHT FAILED BECAUSE THE SEAL IS BAD AND THIS ALLOWED CONDENSATION TO BUILD UP. I CHECKED AROUND AND NOTICED THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR CADILLAC SRX 2010 MODEL YEAR AND NEW OWNERS. SINCE THE PROBLEM IS SO WIDE SPREAD IT SEEMS MORE LIKE AN ENGINEERING DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE COVERED EITHER BY A RECALL OR AN EXTENSION IN THE WARRANTY.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN 40 MPH AS THE TRANSITION REVIVED TO 2X NORMAL LEVELS. I WAS FORCED TO PULL OFF THE INTERSTATE AND TURN OFF THE CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES, RESTART THE CAR AND DRIVE WHILE THE TRANSITION LIGHT REMAINED LIGHT UP.  OVER THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY LIGHT/ENGINE POWERING DOWN SITUATION HAS BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND ALMOST A DAILY SITUATION I EXPECT--NOT A COMFORTING FEELING WHEN ON THE INTERSTATE.  I TOOK THE CAR THE A LOCAL MECHANIC TODAY AND FOR ONCE THE TRANSMITION LIGHT WAS NOT ON AND THE TRACTION STABILITY SITUATION WAS NOT A PROBLEM--GO FIGURE. ANYWAY, THE MECHANIC TESTED THE CAR AND SAID THE ISSUE APPEARED TO BE MOISTURE GETTING INTO THE ACCELERATOR SENSOR AND CAUSING THE ISSUE. HE WAS NOT 100% SURE AND RECOMMENDED I KEEP DRIVING THE CAR AND BRING IN ONCE THE ISSUE POPS UP AGAIN--SURE IT WILL.  DIFFICULT TO PROVE WITHOUT BEING AN EXPERT MECHANIC BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS AN ENGINEERING DEFECT WITH THE CAR CREATING THIS ISSUE AND THE PART SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPLACED WITH A NEWLY ENGINEERED MOISTURE SEALED PART.  ALL ACCELERATION ISSUES LIKE THIS ARE VERY SERIOUS AS GM SHOULD ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.  I REPLACED THE SAME SENSOR APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS AGO AND PROBLEM PERSISTENT OVER THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME. NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU INVEST IN THE CADILLAC BRAND.   *JS",
