THE VEHICLE HAD AROUND 50K MILES ON IT AT THE TIME.  UPON INSPECTION AT THE NEAREST PLACE OF REPAIR, MY ENTIRE RIGHT REAR BREAK DRUM (THE PISTON) HAD BURST AND LEAKED ALL OF THE FLUID FROM THE BREAK LINES INTO THE DRUM.  THE RESULTING METAL FRAGMENTS HAD GROUND INTO THE DRUM AND CAUSED MASSIVE FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  THIS ALL RESULTED IN MY BEING UNABLE TO BRAKE WHILE DRIVING, AND I ALMOST WRECKED THE VEHICLE INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE AT 50 MILES PER HOUR.  I HAD TO ROLL MY VEHICLE INTO A NEARBY SHOP AND HAVE IT FIXED.  THERE IS NO WAY THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  I AM A MECHANIC AND FAILURES LIKE THIS AT SUCH LOW MILES ARE UNHEARD OF.  CHEVROLET DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE PARTS (AT ANY DEALERSHIP IN SC) TO DEAL WITH THE REPAIR, AND THE GENTLEMAN AT THE DEALERSHIP COULDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T EVEN REPLACED ANY BRAKE PADS FOR THESE VEHICLES YET.

FIRST TIME THE VIBRATION WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK I HAD A TIRE COMING APART. WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS MY FRONT BRAKES HAD APPLIED THEMSELVES SLIGHTLY AND WERE GETTING VERY HOT.  UPON BRAKING STEERING WHEEL SHOOK BACK AND FORTH VERY HARD.  HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE VEHICLE WAS NEW.  IS 13 MONTHS OLD NOW.  DEALER HAS REPLACED MASTER CYLINDER, POWER BRAKE BOOSTER, BOTH ROTORS, BRAKE SHOES.  HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE, EVERYTIME I DRIVE ANY DISTANCE ON THE FREEWAY THE BRAKES GET VERY HOT.  I CANNOT HOLD MY HAND ON EITHER FRONT WHEEL BUT A FEW SECONDS.  ROTORS STEAM AND HISS IF I SQUIRT WATER ON THEM.  IS CURRENTLY IN THE DEALER THE FOURTH TIME AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.  I GET LOTS OF BLACK POWDER ON MY WHEELS AFTER DRIVING ON FREEWAY 60 MILES.  *NM",
