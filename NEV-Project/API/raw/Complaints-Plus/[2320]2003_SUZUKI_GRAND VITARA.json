WHILE DRIVING TWO DAYS AGO, THE THROTTLE CABLE BECAME STUCK AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP ACCELERATING. I WAS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO PULL THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD AND TURN IT OFF. AFTERWARD, I DISCOVERED AN OPEN RECALL FOR THE THROTTLE CABLE HOUSING. HOWEVER, THE RECALL WAS ISSUED BEFORE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW FROM THE SUZUKI DEALER IN 2004. I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE ON JANUARY 9, 2004, THE RECALL WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2003. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR SUZUKI TO HAVE SOLD THE VEHICLE WITH AN OPEN RECALL. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL. SUZUKI'S NEGLIGENCE PUT ME IN GREAT DANGER AND RESULTED IN TOWING AND OTHER COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE RECALL WAS PROPERLY HANDLED BEFORE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I HAVE CONTACTED SUZUKI MOTORS OF AMERICA TO DESCRIBE THIS PROBLEM, BUT THERE ONLY OFFER IT TO FIX THE RECALL ITEMS FREE OF CHARGE. THEY HAVE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR ERROR IN SELLING THE VEHICLE WITH AN OPEN RECALL, NOR ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADDITIONAL COSTS I'VE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE.  *TR",
