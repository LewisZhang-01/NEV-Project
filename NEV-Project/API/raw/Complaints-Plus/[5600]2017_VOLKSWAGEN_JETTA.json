UPON ORIGINAL INSPECTION, A TORQUES HEAD BOLT WAS DISCOVERED LOOSE FROM THE FUEL RAIL AND THE FUEL RAIL WAS SEPARATED FROM THE INJECTOR ON THE DISTAL CYLINDER (SEE PICTURE).  SIMPLY TIGHTENING THE FUEL RAIL DID NOT SATISFY THE PROBLEM. THIS IS REPORTEDLY THE RESULT OF THE INJECTORS SHIFTING POSITION AND/OR BEING DAMAGED. AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THIS COMMON VW JETTA PROBLEM, THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST VW DEALERSHIP IN BILLINGS MONTANA.  IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESCRIBED RECALL FIX FOR THIS ISSUE MIGHT ONLY REQUIRE SOME LOCTITE AND WRENCH TURNING FOR THE CARS THAT HAVE NOT YET EXPERIENCED THIS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.
