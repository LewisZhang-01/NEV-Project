Water travels down to floor and pools. For example, spare tire was found to be submerged. Rear seat and trunk carpeting were moist (saturated) to the touch.   Concern: If water in the vehicle is undetected and is allowed to pool for long periods of time,  three things will happen: 1. Accelerated corrosion and loss of function for any electrical wiring.  2. Standing water can develop mold, impacting air quality through long term and repeated exposure. Impact of vehicle occupants health. (In our instance, Mom & newborn)  3. Accelerated corrosion of vehicle internal structure. For example, seat fasteners.  Item was discovered by third party service center and dealership is investigating root cause now. Dealer commented this is a problem more common with other models in the same family but not the model of this vehicle.   No warning or indicator of the problem was present.",
