Sometimes it is the radio switching channels, with an annoying beep each time. Sometimes it is a clock setting display which pops up with a beep asking \"Do you want to change clock settings?\" When these thing happen, other electronics act up - map and navigation goes crazy, phone bluetooth interface goes crazy. When U-Connect is acting up badly, the rearview backup camera sometimes does not work when transmission is shifted into reverse. The U-Connect can be used to adjust drive-train performance thus representing the possibility of an additional safety hazard.
