AUDI EXTENDED DRIVETRAIN COVERAGE ON THESE VEHICLES TO 10YR/120K MI. THIS ISSUE CAUSES A WORSENING LOSS OF POWER UPON ACCELERATING (MAKING DRIVING AT ALL SPEEDS DANGEROUS) AND EVENTUAL ENGINE FAILURE IF LEFT ALONE.    I AM THE 3RD OWNER OF THIS CAR, SO I DID NOT RECEIVE THE INTENDED LETTER FROM AUDI STATING THE SPECIFICS OF THIS COVERAGE EXTENSION. MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT ~110K MILES AT THE TIME OF THIS SERVICE (~4-5 DAYS AGO).

THE COST OF REPAIRS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE IS ~$5,600.    I OPENED A CASE WITH AUDI OF AMERICA.

THE CAR HAS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AND I THEN BEGAN NOTICING THE CAR NOT ACCELERATING PROPERLY AND LABORING WHEN NEARING 50 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE MOTOR WOULD REV UP AND MAKE AN UNUSUAL SOUND AND IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE AUDI DEALER AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION AND COMPUTER MODULE WERE NOT COMMUNICATING PROPERLY AND THAT IT NEEDS A NEW MODULE AT A COST OF ABOUT $3800.   THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR ANY OF THE REPAIRS.  WHEN I ASKED BOTH THEM AND AUDI NORTH AMERICA ABOUT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REGARDING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH 61,000 OTHER AUDI OWNERS ACROSS THE U.S., THEY REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER.  I BELIEVE THAT AUDI HAS KNOWINGLY MADE AND SOLD A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE THAT IS DANGEROUS AND POSES GREAT RISK TO ITS OWNER AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.

THE NEXT MORNING I STARTED THE CAR GOING TO LOOK FOR A BULB TO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHT, NOTICED THE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE I WAS IN MY DARK GARAGE.  THE LIGHT ONLY COMES BACK ON AFTER I TURN THE LIGHTS OFF WHICH IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS.  I LIVE IN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA THAT'S NOT WELL LIT SO I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR AT NIGHT.  I HAVE CONTACTED AUDI, BUT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A RESPONSE.  I TOOK THE A4 TO AN AUDI DEALERSHIP IN DENVER AND WAS TOLD AUDI DOESN'T KNOW IF THE ISSUE IS THE LIGHT ITSELF OR THE BALLAST/IGNITER.  I'VE REPLACED THE BULB AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXIST SO I TOOK THE A4 TO SEVERAL INDEPENDENT EURO SHOPS AND GOT THE SAME DIAGNOSIS, THE IGNITER IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH AUDI VEHICLES.  I AM ASKING THE NTSB TO PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE.  *TR",

PROPER STATE FOR HID HEADLIGHTS IS NOT MAINTAINED AND FLICKERING ENSUES. IF PROPER STEADY STATE IS NOT RETAINED WITHIN A TOLERABLE TIME THE HEADLIGHTS WILL TURN OFF REQUIRING A REFIRING TO CREATE IGNITION IN THE BULB AGAIN. THE \"HEADLIGHT DIPPED\" MESSAGE TELLS THE OPERATOR THAT THE DIPPED HEADLIGHT IS NOT OPERATIONAL. A DIPPED HEADLIGHT IS THE EUROPEAN TERM FOR A LOW BEAM. ONCE THE HEADLIGHT HAS GONE OUT IT WILL REMAIN OUT UNTIL THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS REFIRED BY TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS AND TURNING THEM BACK ON. THIS PROCEDURE CAN BE FOLLOWED TO REOBTAIN LIGHTING WHILE THE VEHICLE HAS LOST LIGHTING IN MOTION BUT DEPENDS ON THE OPERATOR'S ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THE SITUATION AND PERFORM THE APPROPRIATE ACTION.    A VEHICLE'S ABILITY TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL HEADLIGHTS IS IMPORTANT FOR COLLISION AVOIDANCE. THE MITIGATING FACTORS FOR THIS ISSUE ARE THE FACT THAT OFTEN IT IS ONLY ONE HEADLIGHT THAT GOES OUT AND THAT WITH THE PROPER PROCEDURE THE HEADLIGHTS CAN BE RELIT. AGGRAVATING FACTORS FOR THIS SAFETY ISSUE ARE THE FACT THAT HID HEADLAMP ASSEMBLIES ARE SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPLACE AND MANY OF THE VEHICLES THAT EXHIBIT THIS PROBLEM WILL SOON BE OFF OF THE WARRANTY. ADDITIONALLY THE MANUFACTURE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER BULB REPLACEMENT, WHICH COSTS SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HID BULBS, AND REQUIRES BULB REPLACEMENT BEFORE SERVICE OF THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM.

IF I SHUT THE LIGHT SWITCH TO THE OFF POSITION, THEN TO THE ON POSITION, THE HEADLIGHT WOULD RE-IGNITE. I RECENTLY HAD MY CAR SERVICED AGAIN, AND THEY INDICATED THE LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT BULB WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. AFTER REPLACING IT (AT A COST OF $515), AFTER DRIVING IT FOR ABOUT A WEEK, I NOTICED THE CONDITION WAS STILL PRESENT. I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER, AND THEY INDICATED THE OTHER BULB WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER IN THIS INSTANCE COVERED THE COST OF THE BULB AND LABOR. I FEAR THAT THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED BY SIMPLY REPLACING THE BULBS, AND I WILL BE AGAIN DRIVING THE CAR WITH A FAULTY HEADLIGHT, WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT IN THE WRONG CONDITIONS. *TR",

SO I THREW IT OVER TO DRIVE MODE INSTEAD THINKING MAYBE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE OTHER MODE.  IT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE AS I APPLIED THE BRAKE I COULD HEAR THE ACCELERATION CONTINUING AND WHEN REMOVING MY FOOT FROM BRAKE THE CAR TOOK OFF UNTIL I HIT BRAKE AGAIN.  PANICKED I TRIED TO GET OVER FROM THE PASSING LANE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I HAD TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN A CAR I ALMOST HIT AND AN 18 WHEELER.  ONCE OVER ON SIDE I THREW ON EMERGENCY BRAKE AND COULD STILL HEAR AND FEEL CAR ACCELERATING.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE TO STOP IT COMPLETELY.  I WAS SCARED TO DEATH AND SHAKING.  I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED THE FLOOR TO SEE IF SOMETHING HAD OBSTRUCTED THE GAS AREA.  ALL MATS WERE IN PLACE AND NOTHING APPEARED UNUSUAL.  I THEN CHECKED FOR MY CRUISE CONTROL.  I HAVE NEVER USED IT IN THIS CAR AND ACTUALLY HAD TO FIND THE LEVER.  THOUGHT MAYBE I BUMPED IT WHILE USING THE WIPERS.  THE CC IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND NO WHERE NEAR ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE TOUCHED.  I CALLED AUDI ROADSIDE AND THEY TOWED IT TO FREDERICK MD.  I CALLED AUDI CUSTOMER SERVICE THE NEXT MORNING TO ALERT THEM.  THEY SEEMED RESPONSIVE AND CONCERNED.  THE AUDI DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS.  THEY SAID THEY TRIED TO REPLICATE IT.  I ASKED IF THAT MEANT THEY DROVE IT AT NIGHT FOR 2 HOURS IN 13 DEGREE WEATHER IN THE 6TH GEAR OF TIPTRONIC MODE?  THEY SAID NO THEY CONDUCTED COMPUTER TESTS AND FOUND NOTHING.  I HAD TO PICK UP MY CAR THAT I AM NOW TERRIFIED TO DRIVE.  I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM AUDI CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON WHO NOW SEEMS TO NOT BE RETURNING MY CALLS.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME & I NEED TO FIND ANSWERS &/OR GET ANOTHER VEHICLE I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR.  I READ SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA SITE FOR THIS CAR & YEAR. *TR",

THESE SEVERE VIBRATIONS PROMPT ME TO PLACE MY CAR IN NEUTRAL AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS SO I DON'T FEEL ILL.  THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS SINCE MY CAR MAY NOT BE IN GEAR, AND IF I'M DISTRACTED, THEN NEED TO ACCELERATE SUDDENLY, I WON'T BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY.  I'M AFRAID I MAY GET REAR ENDED AT ONE OF THESE TIMES.  THE VIBRATIONS MAKE ME FEEL SICK AND GIVE ME HEADACHES WHILE DRIVING WHICH CAN DETRACT FROM MY ABILITY TO OPERATE THE CAR SAFELY.*JB",

THE STRENGTH OF THE VIBRATION IS VARIED AS THE VIBRATIONS CAN BE STRONG OR WEAK AND AT TIMES, EVEN FEEL AS IF THEY ARE NOT THERE.  THE DANGER IS THAT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AN ANSWER AS TO WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. IT'S RELATED TO STEERING OF THE VEHICLE.  BECOMES VERY DISCONCERTING CREATING A NERVOUS DRIVER AS THE SENSATION FROM THE VIBRATIONS IS ONE OF \"LACK OF CONTROL\".  TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED, REBALANCED AND TIRE PRESSURES CHECKED AND CHANGED MULTIPLE TIMES TO CHECK FOR CHANGES.  THE VIBRATION REMAINS.  DIFFERENT TIRES RESULT IN THE SAME TYPE OF VIBRATION.  THE OVERALL FEELING IS A LACK OF CONTROL, AND THE POTENTIAL THAT MAYBE ONE DAY SOMETHING MAY \"SNAP\" AND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM MAY BE FOUND IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY, BY WAY OF AN ACCIDENT.   I WOULD RATHER NOT WAIT UNTIL THEN.   MANY OTHER AUDI A4 (MODEL B7) OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NO RESOLUTION FROM AUDI AT THIS POINT.  IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF DRIVER COMFORT.  FOR ME, STEERING IS VITAL, AND HOW THE VEHICLE OPERATES IS VERY CONTINGENT ON HOW THE STEERING FEELS AND FUNCTIONS.   SOMETHING DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT WITH MANY OF THESE A4'S. *NM",
