My husband drove the vehicle next for an approximately 12-mile round trip. He noticed the noise get more consistent and louder, and while pulling into our driveway, I observed that the sound was very loud and smoke was coming from the right side wheel well. As soon as he put the vehicle in park, coolant flooded the driveway. We had an independent mechanic come to our home to diagnose the vehicle. He stated that the water pump completely blew and the pulley was loose. The mechanic emphasized that a car this age should not have had a loose water pump/pulley and that this was a manufacturing issue. He was very concerned that if it had blown while driving, it would have shut off the engine entirely and could have caused a catastrophic accident. He recommended a new water pump and thermostat.",

The brake pedal was almost impossible to depress to get the vehicle to even slow down.  She was afraid that she was not going to be able to stop and get in a crash.  Fortunately, she was able to maneuver the vehicle to the shoulder as it finally slowed down enough.  She was afraid to go any farther to an exit for fear of not being able to stop down a sloping exit.  So she was able to come to a stop on the shoulder of the interstate.  Their was a warning light that came on as this was happening, which was the ABS warning light.  It was towed to Andy Mohr Speedway Chevrolet and they have diagnosed it as a failed vacuum pump.  After doing research, I found that there is a recall on 2018 Chevrolet Suburban for the vacuum pump.  However, the VIN on my vehicle wasn't included.  The recall number is N192268490.
