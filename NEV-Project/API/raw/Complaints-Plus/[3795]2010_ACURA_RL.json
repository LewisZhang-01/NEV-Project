NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE NATURE OF THE DEFECT IS SUCH THAT I WOULD NOT FEEL SAFE HAVING MYSELF OR A FAMILY MEMBER RIDE IN THE VEHICLE IN THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT SEAT. A SIMILAR RECALL NOTICE CAME OUT ABOUT THE DRIVER-SIDE AIRBAGS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. THAT PART WAS AVAILABLE QUICKLY, AND THE REPAIR WORK FOR THE RECALL DONE EXPEDITIOUSLY. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IS BECAUSE MY DEALERSHIP (OR AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION) WAS PAYING FOR MY RENTAL CAR IN THE INTERIM. I THINK IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG FOR THIS REPAIR/RECALL TO BE ADDRESSED, AS I RECEIVED THE NOTICE AND CONTACTED MY DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE TWO MONTHS AGO. IT IS DECIDEDLY INCONVENIENT TO HAVE TO USE TWO VEHICLES TO TRANSPORT MY FAMILY PLACES, AS NO ONE CAN RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT AND BE ENSURED THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT AND AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT, THE RISK OF DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY WOULD NOT OCCUR. PLEASE TELL ME HOW I CAN GO ABOUT GETTING THIS REPAIR DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS I THINK THAT THE PRICE OF A RENTAL VEHICLE TO USE IN THE INTERIM SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE COVERED BY THE DEALER, BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE DEFECT.",

FURTHERMORE, I DROVE MY CURRENT RL AT RISK OF LOSING MY LIFE BECAUSE OF METAL SHARDS IN THE AIRBAG FOR THE DURATION UNTIL REPLACEMENT UNDER RECALL.  I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN ENOUGH RISK OF LOSING MY LIFE AND/OR HEALTH AND THIS CANNOT CONTINUE.  I DEMAND ACURA TAKE IMMEDIATE (I MEAN IMMEDIATE) STEPS TO GET ME A COMPARABLE RENTAL CAR.
