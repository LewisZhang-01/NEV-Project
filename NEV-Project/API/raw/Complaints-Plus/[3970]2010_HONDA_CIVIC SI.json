THIS WAS REPAIRED BY CAMPAIGN # 14-034, ENTITLED: PAINT CHALKING, CRACKING, CLOUDING WARRANTY EXTENSION.  THIS WAS REPIRED AND THE PAINT LOOKED GREAT AFTER PICKING THE CAR UP. NOW ON 5/30/18 EXACTLY 1 YEAR LATER THE SAME EXACT THING IS HAPPENING TO THE PAINT ON MY CAR ON BOTH REAR DOORS AND RIGHT SIDE PILLAR ABOVE THE PASSENGER FRONT DOOR. I BROUGHT MY CAR TO THE SAME HONDA DEALER TO HAVE THIS REPIRED BUT THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT THOSE PANELS ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE CAMPAIGN. BUT I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE PANELS WERE ORIGINALLY REPAIRED ON 4/29/17 BECAUSE WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN THERE WAS SOME CLOUDING IN THOSE AREAS ALTHOUGH MINIMAL IN COMPARISON TO ROOF, TRUNK, HOOD AND FENDERS. SO IT'S MY CONCLUSION THAT THEY ONLY COMPOUNDED THE MINIMAL 'CLOUDING/CHAULKING' TO BANDAID DOOR PANELS AND PILLAR INSTEAD OF THE PROPER FIX BECAUSE LESS THAN A YEAR LATER I'M HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. HONDA CLEARLY HAS A ISSUE WITH THEIR CLEAR COAT BECAUSE THESE CLOUDING/CHAULKING ON BOTH REAR DOORS AND RIGHT FRONT PILLAR LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS MY ROOF,HOOD,FENDERS AND TRUNK DID AND THEY REPAIRED THOSE ITEMS ON 4/29/17 THUS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY. SO HONDA SHOULD BE REPAIRING THE CLEAR COAT ON MY DOORS AND PILLAR NOW.",
