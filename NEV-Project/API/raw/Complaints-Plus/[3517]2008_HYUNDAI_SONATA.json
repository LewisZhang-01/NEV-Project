Either I get no answer, voice mail, hung up on, laughed at OR told that they will urgently call me right back. All to no call back . I've reached out on social media, email, called managers, no one has followed up, Horne Hyundai AZ is a joke! And so is the surrounding certified dealers. No one has reached out and I've tried all outlets to dealers (somewhat) near me. No one finds this serious so if I get injured on the campus much longer and i will regret it.",

        "summary": "Hello, I recently purchased a 2008 Hyundai Sonata in Germany and entered the VIN on your website. I noticed that there is an outstanding recall, Manufacturer Recall Number 110 and NHTSA Recall Number 13V113000. I contacted the local dealership in Frankfurt and they informed me that I needed to coordinate with Hyundai North America because my vehicle had U.S. specifications. I contacted ConsumerAffairs@hmausa.com in July 2021 and provided all of the information/documentation requested. Hyundai assigned a Consumer Affairs Case number: 18365036 and assured me that they would send the part to the dealership in Frankfurt ad that they would notify me once the part arrived so that they could take care of the recall. I never heard back or received any further updates. In December 2021, while I was in the U.S., I called Hyundai and requested to speak to someone at their Executive Office that handled complaints. I spoke with \"Momo\" who informed me that my case had been closed. I provided my contact information, including email, and asked that she look at the numerous email strings related to my case, including one that confirmed that the issue would be resolved. \"Momo\" assured me that she would escalate the matter and that someone would contact me to resolve the issue. I have not heard from Hyundai since my conversation with \"Momo\" and have sent a couple of emails requesting an update but haven't received a response. I would respectfully request that a formal investigation be initiated by your office to look into the negligent and unresponsive attitude by Hyundai towards recalls. My experience has reinforced the concern that I had that Hyundai is not committed  to the safety of the American consumer and a complete disregard to your office's authority. Hyundai has al of the information that they need to take fix the issue with their vehicle but choose to ignore it. I have bent over backwards to provide everything requested and Hyundai has the string of emails to confirm.",

CHANGED OIL AND OIL FILTER MYSELF ALONG WITH THE OIL SENSOR ( CONNECTED TO OIL FILTER SPOT) THAT WAS LEAKING BAD AS LONG AS THE CAR WAS RUNNING.I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE, IN FRONT OF A LOADED 18 WHEELER, DRIVING 75 THEN MY CAR JERKED REAL HARD THEN DROPPED DOWN TO 40. I HAD TO PULL OVER ILLEGALLY TO KEEP FROM GETTING HIT BY THE TRUCK. AS I WAS CATCHING MY BREATH I TURNED THE CAR OFF. WHEN I STARTED IT BACK UP IT MADE A WEIRD TICK NOISE. HAVEN'T  HEARD THAT NOISE SINCE. WHEN I PULLED OFF IT HESITATED TO CHANGE GEARS FROM 2 TO 3. IT FINALLY CHANGED AND DID NOT COME OUT OF 3RD. GOT IT TOWED HOME. HAD MY MOMS BOYFRIEND TO CHECK THE TRANSMISSION. HE DROVE IT AND IT WAS FINE. NEXT MORNING STARTED CAR AND IT SOUNDED LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER. (LOW VOLUME) FINALLY IT WENT AWAY. WHEN I HEADED TO WORK,  IT HESITATED AT FIRST. THE VACUUM NOISE CAME BACK AND WAS LOUDER. THEN I SPED UP TO 50, IT HARD JERKED AGAIN, AND STAYED IN 3RD GEAR. AS I WENT FURTHER LOSS POWER  IN INSIDE LANE OF HIGHWAY AND CAR WAS SMOKING UNDER THE HOOD. LIKE IT DIDN'T KNOW I WAS PUSHING THE GAS PEDAL. STARTED SHAKING  AT AROUND 20 MILES AN HOUR. PULLED OVER AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. CALLED A FRIEND TO PULL ME BACK HOME. IT WAS REVERSING FINE BUT WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. SO I CHANGED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR (WHOLE PEDAL) THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM. SO THEN I CHANGED THE ENTIRE FUEL PUMP/ INJECTOR. STILL HAVE ALL PARTS BY THE WAY.  THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM EITHER. PUT IT ON THE MACHINE AND IT GAVE A CODE FOR ECM AND OXYGEN SENSOR.  ESC LIGHT CAME ON AS WELL AS TPMS, WHEN I STARTED THE CAR. I COULD MOVE FORWARD BUT IT WAS LIKE I WASN'T.

AT THE TIME, THERE WAS NOT A METHOD TO RESEARCH MY SPECIFIC VIN, SO I BROUGHT THE CAR TO TAMERON HYUNDAI IN BIRMINGHAM, AL IN THE 30-50K MILE RANGE.

THE RECALL STATES THAT \"IF A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF OIL DRIPS ONTO THE ALTERNATOR, THE ALTERNATOR CAN BE DAMAGED RESULTING IN THE CHARGING SYSTEM BECOMING INOPERATIVE.\" IT GOES ON TO STATE A RISK OF VEHICLE RUNNING ON BATTERY POWER, UNTIL BATTERY VOLTAGE DROPS, AND THEN POTENTIAL FOR ENGINE SHUT OFF, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF A CRASH.    IN JULY, I TOOK MY 2008 SONATA TO THE LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NOTED ON MY INVOICE THAT \"LEFT AND FRONT VALVE COVER GASKETS ARE LEAKING\", AND THAT \"THE FRONT IS LEAKING ON THE ALTERNATOR.\" THIS APPEARS TO BE THE SAME MECHANICAL ISSUE NOTED IN RECALL CAMPAIGN 121, IT IS JUST HAPPENING ON A DIFFERENT HYUNDAI MODEL. IN MY OPINION, THE RISK OF DAMAGE TO THE ALTERNATOR ON MY SONATA (VIA THE CONFIRMED OIL LEAK ONTO IT) IS THE SAME AS WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN HYUNDAI RECALL CAMPAIGN 121.

MY GLASSES PROTECTED MY EYES, BUT MY FOREHEAD IS SORE AND TENDER. THE VISOR NO LONGER STAYS IN THE \"UP\" POSITION AND \"FLOPS\" DOWN AT AN ANGLE. THIS IS DANGEROUS, MY VISIBILITY IS CONSTANTLY BLOCKED.  THE VISOR WASN'T IN USE, IT JUST BROKE.  I SECURED THE DRIVER'S VISOR WITH TAPE. TODAY, JUNE 12, 2012, I DROVE MY SON. HE WAS IN THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN THE VISOR ON THAT SIDE BROKE.  IT JUST DROPPED DOWN AND WILL NO LONGER STAY IN THE UP POSITION!  IT APPEARS THE PLASTIC DEVICE BECOMES BRITTLE AND BREAKS, THE CLIP THAT HOLDS THE VISOR FAILS, AND/OR ARMS WEAKEN. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND I SEE MANY OTHERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL BUT NOT FOR MY CAR.  IT APPEARS MANY HAVE WRITTEN COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTSA YET NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.  I WAS HURT, A LESS EXPERIENCED DRIVER COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, IT IS A SHOCK WHEN THE VISOR DROPS, BLOCKING YOUR VIEW. HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, IT IS A CHEAP, EASY FIX FOR THEM BUT FOR OWNERS IT'S DANGEROUS SUDDENLY WE CAN'T SEE IN TRAFFIC, IN A CROSS WALK, ANYTIME WHILE DRIVING TO HAVE YOUR VISIBILITY SUDDENLY IMPAIRED IS DANGEROUS. AND AS IN MY CASE, THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL HARM.  PLEASE HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM. HYUNDAI IS A GREAT PRODUCT, IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF THE RIGHT THING WASN'T DONE.  *TR",

ONCE AGAIN, AT APPROXIMATELY 52,000 MILES, LOUD GRINDING FROM THE LEFT REAR BRAKE REVEALED THAT BOTH INNER AND OUTER PADS HAD BEEN TOTALLY SCRUBBED OFF WITH LIGHT METAL TO METAL CONTACT, WHILE THE RIGHT REAR PADS STILL HAD GREATER THAN 50% OF ORIGINAL PAD THICKNESS.

THE PADS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HIGH HEAT.  I REPLACED THE PADS TO FINISH MY TRIP AND UPON RETURN IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE NEW PADS HAD BEEN DRAGGING AS EVIDENCED BY A STRONG SMELL AND GLAZED APPEARANCE.  IT DOES NOT SEEM NORMAL FOR THIS CONDITION TO HAPPEN - THERE WAS NO GRINDING OR ABNORMAL NOISE OBSERVED DURING THE MOST RECENT EVENT, UNTIL PULLING INTO OUR DESTINATION, WHEN IT WAS VERY LOUD.
