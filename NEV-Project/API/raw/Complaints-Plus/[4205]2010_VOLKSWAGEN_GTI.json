WITH NO PROBLEMS. NEXT MORNING WOULDN'T START. WITH 59,500 MILES I WAS STOCKED. HAD THE CODES READ COILS, SPARK PLUGS, SO I CHANGED THEM. STILL DIDN'T START. 3 DAY LATER, (SHE'S GARAGE KEPT) AND STARTED UP. WELL IN THE LAST 6 MONTH'S IT HAS DONE THE SAME THING 9 TIMES ON THE FREEWAY, 4 TIMES IN THE CITY. TOOK IT TO VW DEALERSHIP THEY READ CODES P0087 WITCH IS LOW PRESSURE FUEL PUMP, FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE, FUEL FILTER. SO BUYING ALL NEW PARTS, I GOT FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE & FUEL FILTER AT VW DEALERSHIP, FUEL PUMP OVER THE INTERNET ALL NEW PARTS. THE VW PARTS MANAGER TOLD ME THAT VW HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH CONTROL MODULE ON OTHER MODELS, I THINK HE SAID THAT THEY WERE RECALLED ON JETTA'S, GOLF'S AND VW HAS UPDATED THE FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE ON MY 2010 VW GTI 2.0 TURBO 3OR4 TIMES. I ASKED HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M BUYING UPDATED VERSION OR NOT, HE POINTED OUT THE DIFFERENT PART NUMBERS AND SAID YOUR GOOD TO GO. I YOUTUBE VIDEO OF R & R FUEL PUMP, FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE, AND FUEL FILTER. MY CAR RAN GREAT FOR 20.5 MILES, STARTING IT UP TWO DAYS LATER AT HOME, I'M LETTING IT WARM UP THE MOTOR FOR A FEW MINUTES AND JUST QUIT AGAIN WOULDN'T START UP. THEN I FIND OUT THERE'S A UPDATED & UPGRADED FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE THAT'S HAS 32 AMPS. GOING TO THE FUEL PUMP, WIRES, DEVICE, CLIPS FOR $699.00 AFTER I SPENT $500.00 ON THE PARTS INSTALLED. MY POINT IS THAT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT SMART ENOUGH, STRONG ENOUGH, AND ROAD CONDITIONS VARY MAY NOT GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NO POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES, EVERYTHING ON A CAR QUITS.

BACKED OUT OF MY GARAGE, PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE (D), AND PROCEEDED DOWN MY DRIVEWAY.  BEGAN DRIVING OUT MY SUBDIVISION AND NOTICED THE ENGINE RPMS WERE GETTING LOUDER AND THE CAR APPEARED TO BE STUCK IN 1ST GEAR.  I PUT THE DSG TRANSMISSION IN BOTH MANUAL MODE AND SPORT MODE, TRIED TO MANUALLY SHIFT THE VEHICLE INTO ANOTHER GEAR, BUT HAD NO SUCCESS.    STOPPED THE CAR, TURNED IT OFF, WAITED A FEW MINUTES, STARTED THE CAR, STARTED DRIVING AGAIN.  SAME BEHAVIOR... THE CAR WOULD ONLY RUN IN 1ST GEAR.  PROCEEDED TO TURN AROUND TO GET THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY HOUSE ONLY TO LEARN THAT REVERSE WAS NOT WORKING.    CONTACTED VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND HAD THEM TOW THE CAR TO THE LOCAL VW DEALERSHIP.  SERVICE IS CLOSED UNTIL MONDAY, 1/4/2010, SO WILL NOT KNOW NEXT STEPS UNTIL THEN.    CONFIRMED MANUFACTURE DATE OF THIS 2010 VW GTI WAS 07/2009 (APPARENTLY WITHIN THE TIME FRAME VW HAS INDICATED THERE WERE MANUFACTURING ISSUES WITH THE DSG TRANSMISSION).  THE SYMPTOM OF THE FAILURE I EXPERIENCED IS FAR DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT RECALL FROM VW (CARS SHIFTING INTO NEUTRAL).  IN THIS CASE, MY CAR SIMPLY WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF 1ST GEAR AND ALSO WOULD NOT WORK IN REVERSE).    BELIEVE THE VW DSG TRANSMISSION ISSUE IS ONLY GOING TO EXPAND.  WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NHTSA FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER WITH VW TO ENSURE ALL AFFECTED TRANSMISSIONS ARE REPLACED. *TR    REGARDS,  BRIAN PEARSON",
