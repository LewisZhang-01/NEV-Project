AS IT WAS, WE WERE LUCKY THAT THE FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED SO QUICKLY AND PREVENTED THE GAS TANKS FROM EXPLODING.  BOTH LANES ON HWY 412 WERE SHUT DOWN, MANY PEOPLE GATHERED , ETC.

I THINK THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED TO AVOID HAVING POSSIBLE FATALITIES.  I HAVE INSURANCE, HOWEVER, IT WILL NOT PUT ME BACK WHERE I WAS.  THE VEHICLE WAS EXTREMELY WELL MAINTAINED AND I PLANNED TO RETAIN IT FOR 20 OR MORE YEARS.
