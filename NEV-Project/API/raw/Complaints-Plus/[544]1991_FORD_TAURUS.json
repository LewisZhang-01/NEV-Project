OUR TRANSMISSION SHOP TOLD US THAT THIS CAR SUFFERED FROM A DESIGN DEFECT, IN THAT THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT COOLING SYSTEM, AND THAT IF THE TRANSMISSION BECAME HOT IT COULD FAIL UPON HAVING TO SHIFT GEARS AT SLOWER SPEEDS.  THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR CAR; MY WIFE HAD COMPLETED A LONG, HIGHWAY TRIP, AND THE TRANSMISSION SIMPLY FAILED AND LOCKED UP AFTER SHE EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND BEGAN STOP AND GO DRIVING.  SHE WAS ACTUALLY PULLING AWAY FROM A STOP LIGHT WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  IN AUGUST 1999, I DISCOVERED THAT FORD HAD ACTUALLY SENT OUT A LETTER IN 1995 ADVISING OF AN EXTENSION OF ITS WARRANTY ON THESE TRANSMISSIONS DUE TO REPEATED FAILURES.  I SENT A LETTER ASKING FOR REIMBURSEMENT AT THAT TIME, SINCE OUR CAR HAD BEEN ONLY 1,518 MILES OVER THE 60,000 LIMIT AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE, BUT I RECEIVED A REPLY FROM FORD REFUSING TO PROVIDE ANY REIMBURSEMENT WHATSOEVER.  I TOOK NO ACTION AT THAT TIME, BUT RECENTLY, THE TRANSMISSION ON THIS CAR FAILED AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH ONLY 79,400 MILES (ABOUT 18,300 MILES SINCE PREVIOUS FAILURE) AND WE HAVE INCURRED ANOTHER $2,300 IN REPAIR EXPENSE, DESPITE OUR HAVING TAKEN MORE THAN ADEQUATE CARE OF THIS CAR.
