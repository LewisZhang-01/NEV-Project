I CALLED THE GM DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD TO WAIT FOR 20 MIN WHILE LEAVING THE KEY IN THE ON POSITION. IT WORKED. BUT WHEN I CHECKED THE INTERNET (HTTP://WWW.CAR-FORUMS.COM/S9/T1545.HTML) AND FOUND THIS PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON. FOR EXAMPLE, 1) I HAVE FOUND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PASSLOCK ANTI THEFT SYSTEM DEFECTS. PLEASE TAKE 5 MINUTES TO FILE A COMPLAINT TO THE NHTS ABOUT THIS MATTER. HTTP://WWW-ODI.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/IVOQ/ GM DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANYMORE OF YOUR MONEY. THEY WILL NOT RECALL THIS PROBLEM. WITH ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTS THE GOVERNMENT WILL RECALL THIS PRODUCT AND MAKE GM FIX AT THEIR EXPENSE 2) I AM THE NOT TO PROUD OWNER OF A 2002 CHEVY MALIBU. MY LASTEST REPAIR IS THE PASSLOCK SENSOR..........A WHOLE WHOPPIN $500 PLUS THE COST OF MY RENTAL CAR AND TOW BILL. THIS LOVELY GM PRODUCT HAS BEEN THE WORST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED!! I THINK BY THE TIME IT IS PAID OFF IN ANOTHER YEAR ALMOST EVERYTHING UNDER THE HOOD WILL HAVE BEEN REPLACED. I WILL NEVER AGAIN OWN A GM HUNK OF JUNK.......THERE IS DEFINATELY SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT OWNING A FOREIGN CAR.....I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! THE AMERICAN CAR MAKERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT THAT IS BEING BUILT!! I AM PROUD TO BE AMERICAN BUT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THE OWNER OF AN AMERICAN MADE VEHICLE  3) ..HI THERE, I'M A CANADIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENT WITH A 1997 CHEV MALIBU THAT HAS THAT :CUSSING: PASSLOCK SYSTEM. THAT THING DRIVES ME INSANE AND THERE IS MANY A TIME THAT I AM STUCK SITTING IN MY CAR FOR 10 MINUTES IN A DARK PARKING LOT AWAY FROM MY SCHOOL WHILE IT DOES ITS THING. I PERSONALLY FIND THAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN MY CAR BEING STOLEN",

ALL 4 INCIDENTS WERE SIMILAR IN THAT CAR KIND OF TOOK OFF ON IT'S OWN AND WAS NOT CONTROLLABLE AS FAR AS STEERING OR BRAKING. THIS CAR IS IN LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP FOR LAST FEW DAYS FOR THEM TO FIND/CORRECT THIS PROBLEM OUR DAUGHTER IS DRIVING THIS CAR AND IT'S NOT SAFE RIGHT NOW FOR HER TO DRIVE. THE DEALERSHIP CAN NOT FIND THE PROBLEM. FIRST THEY THOUGHT ANTI LOCK BRAKES HAD A GLITCH, OR THE TRANSMISSION,BUT CAR IS NOT DOING THIS WHEN THEY TAKE FOR SHORT DRIVES AND THEY CAN NOT PIN POINT THIS PROBLEM. ,BUT THERE IS MOST CERTAINLY A PROBLEM. I DO NOT WANT MY CHILD TO GET HURT OR WORSE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE B/C NO ONE CAN DETECT THE PROBLEM. ALSO CAR HAD A BURNING RUBBERY/LIKE A BELT SMELL BEFORE AT LEAST 2 OF THESE INCIDENTS. ALL BELTS CHECK OUT OK. NO PROBLEMS. I HAVE A RELATIVE THAT HAD A CHEV VAN THAT IN LAST YEAR OR SO CAR BASICALLY TOOK OFF ON IT'S OWN AT A SPEED OF 50MPH. COULD NOT STOP VEHICLE WAS PUTTING ALL WEIGHT PRESSURE ON BRAKE CAR FINALLY CAME TO A STOP. PROB WOUND UP BEING A COMPUTER CHIP IN TRANSMISSION TRIGGERED THE CRUISE CONTROL COMPUTER CHIP TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE CHANGED . PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS TO SEE IF RELATED TO OUR ISSUE. THANK YOU. *JB",

THIS HAS CAUSED ME SOME NEAR ACCIDENTS SINCE I WAS UNABLE TO EASILY TURN AROUND AND LOOK BEHIND ME AS I AM MERGING ONTO HIGHWAYS.  AT TIMES, I WAS FORCED TO UNLATCH THE SEAT BELT WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE IT BECOMES SO TIGHT ACROSS MY CHEST AND SHOULDER.

PLEASE ADVISE IF THERE IS ANY SIMILAR COMPLAINT/CONCERN FROM ANOTHER OWNER.

AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE DEALER SAID IT WAS THE IGNITION SWITCH.  UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE IGNITION SYSTEM IS COVERED TO 50,000 MILES BUT THE DEALER STATED TEH IGNITION SWITCH IS NOT PART OF THE IGNITION SYSTEM.  AFTER WRITTING CHEVY COMPLAINT DEPT MANY TIMES I GOT NO WHERE BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS CALLL THE DEALER, THEY DO NOT GO WITH AN INDEPENDENT BODY JUST THE DEALER THAT GAVE ME THE ADVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE.  I HAD THE DEALER RETURN THE BAD PART TO ME AND WANT TO KNOW IF THIS PART IS COVERED.  I PAID 400.00 TO HAVE IT FIXED.  THE DEALER DID GIVE ME A 75.00 CREDIT BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER MY KEY MEMORY THEY STATED IT WAS THE IGNITION SWITCH THE ENTIRE TIME.*AK    NOW, THE CAR IS AT 54,000 MILES AND COOLANT IS LEAKING AROUND, IN AND NEAR THE ENGINE.

THE NOISE IS LIKE A GROUNDING OR METAL RUBBING NOISE.  WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE BRAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE BRAKES ARE GOING TO SNAP OFF. I HAVE BROUGHT THIS CAR INTO TWO DIFFERENCE REPAIR SHOPS AND THEY ALL STATED THAT THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO HOW CHEVY MADE THE BRAKES.  THEY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THEY NOW USE METAL ON THE BRAKES AND WHEN THE BRAKES GET HOT THEY MAKE THIS NOISE.  I CAN TURN THE CAR ON AND USUALLY WITHIN 15 MINUTES THE BRAKES START MAKING THE NOISE.  I HAD THE BRAKES OILED, BRAKES PADS REPAIRED AND NOTHING TAKES THE NOISE AWAY.  FROM WHAT I AM TOLD AND FROM WHAT I HAVE READ FROM OTHER PEOPLES COMPLAINTS IS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND IF YOU GET THE BRAKES REPLACED EVENTUALLY IT WILL START AGAIN.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHY NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  LIKE SOMEONE ELSE STATED WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR A RECALL TO BE ISSUED.  A DEATH OR INJURY DUE TO THE BRAKES.  I AM LUCKY COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE BRAKES FAIL.  I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE I CAN TAKE OF HEARING THE NOISE.  I CONTACTED THE CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA EMAIL AND ALL THEY TOLD ME WAS TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER AND HAVE IT LOOKED AT. SINCE THEY CAN'T INSPECT THE CAR THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THE DEALERS.  NOT ONCE DID THEY EVER ADMIT TO ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES.  I PAID ALOT FOR THIS CAR AND I SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH BRAKE PROBLEMS.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER MANY TIMES BUT THEY WERE NOT HELPFULL.  I WON'T GO BACK ANYMORE TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT CARS FROM THERE AND THEY HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.  I JUST WANT THIS BRAKE ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED.",

DATE, I HAD CHEVY DO THE FOLLOWING:  NEW BRAKES (ALL THE WAY AROUND - ONCE, FRONT ROTORS/PADS - TWICE), ALL NEW PISTONS, TRANSMISSION REPLACED, MISS ON #1 CYLINDER - REPLACED 1 FAILED SPARK PLUG, LEFT REAR DOOR SQUEAKS WHEN OPEN/SHUT - LUBED (HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES NOW), FRONT LEFT NOISE FROM STRUTS/BRAKES - NOT ABLE TO VERIFY AS OF YET (POSSIBLE STRUT PROBLEM/LUBE), FAN IN DASHBOARD HAS A SOUND IN THE MIDDLE (JUST ABOVE THE CD PLAYER/RADIO) LIKE THERE IS A PIECE OF PAPER CAUGHT IN THE HOUSING (CONFIRMED AFTER 4 COMPLAINTS, FAULTY FAN MOTOR), PASSENGER FRONT SEAT SQUEAKS WHEN OCCUPIED (DEALERSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE./FIX), REARVIEW MIRROR RATTLES WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS (TIGHTENED, STILL DOES IT IN HOT WEATHER).

GM REPLACED THE BRAKES FOR US.  13,000 MILES LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  AFTER MUCH COMPLAINING AND LETTER WRITING, GM REPLACED THE BRAKES AGAIN.  I INSPECTED THE BRAKES IN BOTH INSTANCES AND NOTICED THAT ONLY THE INNER BRAKE PAD WAS WORN, THE OUTER PAD LOOKED BRAND NEW.    THE CALIPER IS CAST ALUMINUM AND IT BENDS WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED MUCH LIKE A CHEAP \"C\" CLAMP THAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN A DOLLAR STORE.  THERE ARE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT THIS CONDITION.  FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE SAFETY OF THIS SYSTEM.  WITH THE CONSTANT FLEXING I AM CONCERNED THAT THE CALIPER MAY FRACTURE AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.    IN ADDITION TO THE FLEXING, I BELIEVE THE INNER PAD IS OVERHEATING, SINCE IT IS DOING ALL OF THE WORK, AND THIS COULD CAUSE BRAKE FADE.   THE CALIPER ALSO APPEARS TO BIND ON THE GUIDE PINS WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.  WHEN THE CASTING BENDS, IT CAUSES A MISALIGNMENT OF THE GUIDE PINS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE CALIPER THEN BINDS.  THE SECOND ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH THE LIFE OF THE BRAKES.  GM SAYS THE BRAKES SHOULD ONLY LAST BETWEEN 8,000 AND 12,000 MILES.  IF THE CALIPER DIDN'T FLEX AS MUCH AND THE PADS WERE WEARING EVENLY THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE BRAKES WOULD GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY.  IN EITHER CASE GM BLEW IT WITH THEIR CHOICE OF THESE CALIPERS ON THIS VEHICLE.  AT THE VERY WORST, THEY ARE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK.  I WONDER HOW MANY ACCIDENTS INVOLVING THESE VEHICLES COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BRAKES, AND ARE PEOPLE EVEN LOOKING AT THE BRAKES AS A CAUSE?  AT BEST, GM IS SHAFTING THEIR CUSTOMERS. PEOPLE ARE PAYING NEEDLESSLY FOR SERVICE WORK THEY DON'T NEED.    THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS INJURY RESULTING FROM THIS.  IT ALSO SPEAKS TO GM'S INTEGRITY AND ETHICS, ALLOWING AN INFERIOR BRAKE SYSTEM TO BE USED ON ITS VEHICLES.   *NLM",
