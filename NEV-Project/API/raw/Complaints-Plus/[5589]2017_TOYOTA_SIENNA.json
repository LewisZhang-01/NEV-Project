        "summary": "On 10/14/2021, as my wife was pulling into our attached garage, the vehicle suddenly accelerated, hitting a metal storage shelf located at the back wall of the garage. The impact of the crash caused the vehicle and the shelf to extensively damage the dry wall of that area of the garage, as well as to damage the pedestal supporting the house water heater, which resulted in the water heater detaching away from the wall and being destroyed. There was, of course, also major damage to the front bumper area of the vehicle. It is my contention that the cause of the accident lies in some component of the vehicle acceleration system. I believe this to be true because of two prior incidents which occurred within the month before this happened. On 09/16/2021, I was driving this vehicle and wanted to make a U-turn. I was traveling at approximately 10 MPH, but as I began the turn, suddenly, the vehicle accelerated to about 25 MPH, even though my foot was off the accelerator. My wife and granddaughter were in the vehicle at the time and both expressed alarm, somehow thinking I had purposely made this maneuver, which I assured them that I had not. Then, approximately 7-10 days later (I am unsure of the date), I was driving, alone, in  this vehicle and went to make a left-hand turn. The vehicle again accelerated, even though I had removed my foot from the accelerator pedal and was applying the brakes. I estimate that as I began the turn, my speed was 10-15 MPH, but the vehicle accelerated to 25-30 MPH. I dismissed both of these prior incidents as not too important and attributed them to some unknown anomaly on the road. However, after the latest incident involving the damage to my garage and vehicle, research showed that several Toyota models and specifically the Sienna have had similar issues in the past.  I am reporting this incident to Toyota for their evaluation, but wanted to make your agency aware, also.",

I\u2019ve done this many times in the past.  On this day as I put my foot on the break the van accelerated at a very very high speed. The van was out of my control at this point.  I do not know how fast because this all happened in seconds.  I was heading straight to their privacy wood fence only feet away.  Approximately 20 feet.  I don\u2019t recall breaking again but turned the wheel to the right trying to avoid the fence.  I hit the fence at a high speed damaged the left bumper and scraped the drivers side of the door.  The next second I attempt to break again so I could back out of this when the van continued to accelerate at high speed  going straight toward the house only a few feet away. I attempted to avoid the house and hit the right bumper hard at a high speed on the corner of the house.  At this point the acceleration stopped and I was able to backup and turn the car around and finally turn the car off.   There is major damage to the van and some to the fence and house.  I was very upset and in shock and some soreness the next day but thankfully no one was hurt. This is a very small yard area that this took place at.  I am still in shock and extremely confused as to why this happened. I do know without question my foot was not in the accelerator.  The van is presently in the body shop.   I would like to mention I have a clean record at the age of 64 I have never had an accident and/or speeding ticket in my life.  This truly was not human error.  I\u2019m a very experienced driver.  If it was human error the van should have stopped at the first point of impact on the fence, but did not.  It continued to accelerate at a fast speed after hitting the fence hard. The van paused but continued to accelerate at this point when I hit the break again and it went toward the right straight for their house.",

        "summary": "on July 3rd, traveling on highway to airport tire blew out (right rear). Pulled to side of road and attempted assistance but this was friday afternoon before july 4th holiday, NOTHING was going to happen except a tow - possible wait as long as 2-3 hours. reportedly the Sienna has drive flat  (50 miles at 50 mph) We drove 5 mph for approx 3 to 4 miles to tire store/Les Schwab. Flat was replaced but then on inspection ALL remaining tires had card showing wear on inner tires. ALL 4 (including the blowout). Pictures submitted .   Of particular concern is that we had taken the vehicle about 10 K prior (March)specifically for tire wobble noise and to fix alignment. Wear was noted, but no safety concerns raised and no cautionary recommendations offered. When we brought the vehicle and tires to the dealer AFTER the blowout we were told by service manager that the early wear was a known problem to occur specifically on the all wheel Siennas. Again, NO CAUTIONARY ADVICE GIVEN in March despite recognized wear and this known history.  We had a blowout in heavy holiday traffic at 60 mph less than 10K /3month later. This easily could have been catastrophic. We reported to Toyota to a  \"Beth\" at customer documentation and risk reduction department who did an excellent job of deflecting causation/potential blame and advised us  to contact the tire manufacturer or the dealer.  Absolutely no evidence of concern for  safety - ours or those around us - at highway speeds. Review of web shows known problem, service manager volunteered it to be a known problem of premature wear, with service  given shortly before incident WITHOUT GUIDANCE. \"Beth\" told us she would document our concerns but that there was nothing Toyota could do or would do other than documenting. I am hopeful you can investigate further  and initiate some reparative process before there is a preventable catastrophe much like the Prius accelerator problem.  we will send copies of to wherever is useful",

WHEN I WAS PRESSING GAS PEDAL  THE CAR DID NOT ACCELERATE AT ALL. ON THE CONTRARY, THE MINI-VAN WAS SLOWING DOWN. I BECAME NERVOUS SINCE THAT WAS A 3 LANES HIGHWAY, I WAS IN LEFTIST LANE AND THERE WAS NARROW CUBE AND DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO STOP.    I PRESSED GAS PEDAL HARDER, AND ENGINE GOT TO 6000 RPM HOWEVER THERE WAS NO POWER AT ALL. WHAT MADE ME MORE NERVOUS WAS THAT THE DISPLAY DID NOT SHOW THE TRANSMISSION INDICATOR AT ALL. THE DISPLAY SUPPOSES ALWAYS SHOW THE TRANSMISSION INDICATOR SUCH AS P/N/D'.  HOWEVER, AT THAT TIME THE DISPLAY DID NOT SHOW ANY OF THAT, THE DISPLAY AREA WAS BLANK. I ALSO PULLED THE SHIFT HANDLER BACKWARD TO MAKE SURE THE GEAR WAS ON 'D' , INSTEAD OF 'N'. THAT DID NOT HELP.     I ASKED MY WIFE TO TURN ON THE EMERGENCY LIGHT SINCE I HAD TO FOCUS TO CONTROL THE CAR. I WAS DOING PRESSED/RELEASE GAS PADDLE REPEAT AND IT PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT POWER TO THE CAR. I MANAGED SWITCHED TO THE RIGHTEST LANES   AND GET TO A CLOSED EXIT. I STOPPED THE CAR, OPENED THE FRONT HOOK AND SAW NOTHING WRONG. ONCE I RESTART THE MINIVAN, I SAW THE 'P' SHOWED UP IN THE DISPLAY. I TESTED THE MINI VAN. SEEMED TO ME, IT WAS BACK TO NORMAL. I DROVE WITH EXTRA CAUTION AND FEAR BACK TO HOME.     ALL THIS HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THE VERY FIRST 5000 MILES SERVICE FOR MY NEW CAR.     TRANSMISSION LOST POWER IN THE HIGHWAY IS VERY DANGEROUS. IT MAY CAUSE FATAL  ACCIDENT.   I AM WORRIED THIS MAY HAPPY AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR IN A HIGHWAY WITH MY FAMILY. I REQUEST THIS TO BE INVESTIGATED TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.",

AS A RESULT, UNDER SOME DAYLIGHT DRIVING CONDITIONS, SUCH AS WHEN EXTERIOR CONDITIONS ARE BRIGHT BUT THERE IS NO DIRECT LIGHT ON THE GAUGES, THE SPEEDOMETER IS NOT EASILY VISIBLE.  FOR THE DRIVER TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT SPEED, FUEL LEVEL, ETC., IT CAN TAKE SEVERAL SECONDS FOR THE DRIVER'S EYES TO ADJUST TO THE DARKER INSTRUMENT PANEL AND LONGER IF THE DRIVER IS WEARING SUNGLASSES.  THIS TAKES THE DRIVER'S ATTENTION OFF THE ROAD OR PREVENTS THE DRIVER FROM ACCESSING CRITICAL INFORMATION.      PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS OF THE TOYOTA SIENNA LE, SUCH AS THE 2010, ILLUMINATED THE GAUGES BRIGHTLY WITH THE HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF.

THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING ABOUT THE DESIGN OR CONTRAST OF THE GAUGES THAT HELPS MAKES THEM VISIBLE WITHOUT BACKLIGHTING.  SOME OTHER TOYOTA SIENNA MODELS HAVE A WHITE BACKGROUND ON THE GAUGES WHICH MAKES THEM VISIBLE IN DAYLIGHT.

THIS CONTROL HAS NO EFFECT WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SWITCHED TO DRL OFF OR AUTO (UNDER DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS).  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS NO METHOD OF BRIGHTENING THE GAUGES WITHOUT TURNING ON THE HEADLIGHTS IN THE DAY TIME.  AND EVEN THEN, THE GAUGES ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR ALL CONDITIONS.

I HAVE HOME SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE CONFIRMING THAT THE GLASS WAS INTACT WHEN PARKED AND THAT NOBODY OTHER THAN MYSELF HAD SET FOOT IN THE GARAGE DURING THE TIME IN QUESTION.    ONLY BY CHANCE HAD I POSITIONED OUR CHILDREN'S CAR SEATS TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BENCH SEAT AND THE SEATS WERE NOT OCCUPIED AT THE TIME THE GLASS FAILED.  OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVING GLASS FRAGMENTS FROM MY KID'S LAP, FACE, EARS, EYES  MOUTH, ETC..  I FEEL VERY LUCKY BUT HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
