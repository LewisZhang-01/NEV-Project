THE FRONT BRAKES WILL ALSO ACTIVATE INCONSISTENTLY WITH EXCESSIVE PRESSURE WHEN THE REAR BRAKES ARE APPLIED CAUSING STEERING VIBRATION.   KAWASAKI HAS ADMITTED  THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL EARLY 2015- CONCOURS BIKES AND EVEN ATTEMPTED TO RETROFIT A 2016 ABS MODULE TO MY 2014 TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. KAWASAKI WAS UNABLE TO RETROFIT THE ABS MODULE AND REPLACED THE WHOLE SYSTEM BUT THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED.     HTTPS://WWW.MECHANICADVISOR.COM/PROBLEMS/KAWASAKI/2012/CONCOURS-14",
