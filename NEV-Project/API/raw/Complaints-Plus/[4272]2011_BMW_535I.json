I WAS TOLD THAT THE MOST LIKELY CASE WAS THE COLD AIR. THEY CHECKED FOR EXCESS AIR LEAKS IN BOTH HEAD LIGHTS BUT DID NOT FIND EXCESS AIR LEAKS. (SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT) THEY ALSO REPLACED A GASKET, OIL FILTER HOUSING. THE OIL FILTER HOUSING WAS ALLOWING OIL TO LEAK OUT FROM THE ENGINE 5.8. THEY PERFORMED REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE OIL FILTER HOUSING GASKET AND WASHED DOWN THE ENGINE OF THE OIL RESIDUE. THE INCIDENTS WERE DIAGNOSED AND REPLACE ACCORDINGLY ON JAN. 24. 2019.  JUST RECENTLY, ABOUT 5 DAYS AGO TODAY, MY CAR STARTED MAKING A WEIRD LOUD NOISE LIKE A GARBAGE TRUCK MAKES WHEN IT GOES FROM STOP TO STOP. IT MADE THAT SOUND WHEN DRIVING, AS WELL AS WHEN PARKED WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO OPEN MY TRUCK WITH NEITHER THE INSIDE BUTTON OR MY KEYS. I TOOK MY CAR TO A REPAIR SHOP THAT WAS CLOSE BY. THE OWNER USED TO WORK FOR BMW SERVICE CENTER AS A MECHANIC BEFORE STARTING HIS OWN BUSINESS. STRANGELY, THE CAR DID NOT MAKE THE SOUND IN HIS PRESENCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS LEFT RUNNING. I LEFT HIS SHOP AND WAS HEADING HOME WHEN SUDDENLY I GOT A RED ERROR MESSAGE WARNING ME THAT THE ENGINE HAD OVER HEATED AND THAT I SHOULD DRIVE SLOWLY AND/OR PULL OVER AS OVER HEATING COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO CATCH ON FIRE. THE MESSAGE ALSO SAID THE VEHICLE NEEDED COOLANT. I PURCHASE THE COOLANT ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL, BUT THE CAR OVERHEATED ONCE AGAIN WHEN I BEGAN TO DRIVE IT. I ALLOWED IT TO COOL DOWN AND DROVE IT HOME. I POPPED THE HOOD AFTER IT COOL DOWN AGAIN AND NOTICED A GREASY/OILY DARK BROWN SUBSTANCE IN COOLANT/RADIATOR HOLE.

THEN I NOTICED THE SMELL A FEW SECONDS LATER, SO I OPENED A WINDOW EXPECTING TO FIND SMELL A FIRE NEARBY OR HEAR SIRENS. AT THAT POINT WE SAW A PLOOM OF SMOKE COME FROM UNDER HIS SEAT TOWARDS THE PASSENGER SIDE OPEN WINDOW. HE IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER, JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR AND TURNED EVERYTHING OFF. THE SMOKE TOOK SOME TIME TO CLEAR BUT DID STOP. SEVERAL MINUTES LATER WE DROVE 1 MILE TO THE BMW DEALERSHIP.     WE WERE TOLD ITS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, AND WOULD COST $1,700 TO FIX. I DECLINED TO PAY $1,700 TO FIX AND REQUESTED THEY DISCONNECT SEAT HEATER. BMW PERSONNEL INFORMED ME IT COULD NOT DISCONNECT POWER TO SEAT HEATER WITHOUT DISCONNECTING THE ENTIRE AC/HEAT SYSTEM. THIS IS A PERSONAL SAFETY ISSUE, NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE. FOR A SEAT HEATER TO CAUSE SMOKE IT CAUSED A FIRE AND THIS IS A DEFECT. THE CAR WILL CATCH ON FIRE IF THE SEAT WARMER IS ACTIVATED. I ASKED DEALERSHIP WHAT IF I LOAN MY CAR TO SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THE DEFECT, THEY SUGGESTED PUTTING TAPE OVER THE BUTTON. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE SAFETY MEASURE TO PREVENT BURNS, FIRE, OR EVEN DEATH.    CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT PEOPLE HAVE SMALL CHILDREN THAT RIDE IN THIS VEHICLE. ON A COLD MORNING I COULD HAVE BUCKLED KIDS IN, TURNED ON CAR, SEAT HEATER, AND TALK TO A NEIGHBOR FOR 2 MINUTES, OR TEACHER AT THE CARPOOL LINE.... WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN?    THERE IS NO VISIBLE DAMAGE TO VEHICLE BUT BMW PERSONNEL DID AGREE THERE WAS SMOKE SMELL IN VEHICLE CAUSED BY SEAT WARMER.",

THE TIRES ARE GOODYEAR EAGLE 245/40 VR19 'RUN FLAT' TIRES. ON FOUR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS I HAVE HIT RELATIVELY MINOR POTHOLES. THE RUN FLATS DO NOT BURST, BUT BUBBLE APPEAR ON THE SIDE AND EVENTUALLY THEY DEFLATE. AFTER THAT HAPPENS THEY ARE INOPERABLE UNLESS YOU DRIVE BELOW 30 MILES AN HOUR. HENCE I HAVE REPLACED FOUR TIRES SO FAR AT A COST OF NEARLY $2000. (RECEIPTS AVAILABLE). I HAVE SPOKEN TO BMW NORTH AMERICA,WHO INSTALLS THESE TIRES, AFTER MUCH HAGGLING THEY FINALLY AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR HALF MY COST. HOWEVER I AM REALLY NERVOUS DRIVING THE CAR NOW, AS THE SLIGHTEST IMPERFECTION ON ROAD SURFACE CREATES A MAJOR TIRE PROBLEM.THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS TO BMW (SEE WEBSITE 'BIMMERFEST' (A BMW ENTHUSIAST WEBSITE). THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT ARE TRYING  TO DEAL WITH ON A ONE BY ONE BASIS. BECAUSE THE CAR COMES WITH RUN FLAT TIRES ONLY, THERE IS NO SPARE TIRE. HENCE IF YOU REPLACE WITH REGULAR TIRE, YOU HAVE NO BACKUP IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE. I AM HOPING THAT YOU WOULD INVESTIGATE AND HOPEFULLY PERSUADE BMW TO RECALL THESE TIRES AND REPLACE WITH BETTER TIRES. WHEN I SPEAK WITH BMW OF NORTH AMERICA THEY RESPOND AND SAY THAT THESE ARE GOODYEAR TIRES, AND NOT MANUFACTURED BY BMW HENCE THEY TRY AND TRANSFER THE BLAME TO GOODYEAR. BMW SOLD THIS VEHICLE WITH THESE TIRES, THEY CHOSE THEM. I SUSPECT TO SAFE MONEY ON PUTTING A SPARE OR DONUT WHEEL IN THE CAR. IN MY MIND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE EXPENSIVE AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, THANK YOU.  *TR",

AS OF APRIL 2011, TWO AIR BUBBLES DEVELOP ON THE SIDE WALL ON ONE OF MY FRONT TIRE WHILE  I ONLY HAVE LESS THAN 2300 MILES ON THE CAR.     THIS AIR BUBBLE ISSUE HAPPENS SO VAST THAT IT AFFECTS ALL BMW OWNERS WITH GOODYEAR TIRES AND ALL BMW DEALERS ARE OUT OF STOCK FOR THIS TIRE. THE TIRE IS ON ONE MONTH NATIONAL BACK ORDER. LITERALLY, WE ARE DRIVING ON A TICKING TIME BOMB WHERE AIR BUBBLES CAN DEVELOP. TIRES CAN BE EXPLODED ANY TIME. AND RIMS CAN BE BENT. CATASTROPHE ACCIDENTS OR DEATHS CAN OCCUR.     AS OF TODAY, I AM ON THE THIRD WEEKS OF WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT GOODYEAR TIRE. EVEN THOUGH BMW INSTALLED A LOANER BRIDGESTONE TIRE UNTIL THEY HAVE THE BACK ORDER GOODYEAR IN STOCK, I AM STILL NOT TRUSTING RIDING ON THE OTHER THREE GOODYEAR TIRES BECAUSE THESE ARE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. IT AFFECTS ALMOST ALL BMW OWNERS WHO HAVING GOODYEAR RUN FLAT TIRES ON THEIR CARS, PARTICULARLY ON THE 19 INCHES ONES WHILE THERE ARE NO ISSUE WITH OTHER BRANDS SUCH AS MICHELIN AND DUNLOP WHICH ARE ALSO INSTALLED ON THE SAME BMW MODEL.

EVEN THOUGH I DID PURCHASE TIRE INSURANCE WITH BMW, BMW IS STILL NOT WILLING TO DO THE BRAND REPLACEMENT. BMW INSISTS ME TO WAIT FOR THE BACK ORDER GOODYEAR.    I THINK THAT DOT SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS GOODYEAR AIR BUBBLE ISSUES & FORCE BMW TO RECALL THESE DEFECTED TIRES BEFORE ANY CATASTROPHE OR DEATH HAPPENS.     THANK YOU  *TR",

THIS CAR WILL PULL YOU TOWARD THE GUARD RAIL AND ONLY A FRANTIC, PANIC, SAVE MY LIFE MOVE CAN KEEP THE CAR FROM CRASHING. I FEAR FOR MY LIFE WHEN I DRIVE THIS CAR. I HAVE NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER DRIVEN SUCH A HORRIBLE CAR.MAYBE WHEN I A AM KILLED IN THIS CAR BMW WILL PAY FOR MY FUNERAL. THIS IS THE BIGGEST COVER UP IN THE HISTORY OF CARS. THEY HAVE LACK OF CONSCIENCE THAT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THEY ARE TORTURING NEW OWNERS OF THIS CAR WHO PAID GOOD IF NOT BLOOD MONEY TO OWN ONE AND NOW DESPERATELY WANT HELP TO FIX OR GET RID OF THIS CAR. I WANT OUT. I AM TALKING TO LAWYERS AND MAYBE THIS IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE BMW UNDERSTANDS. CLASS ACTION SUIT SEEMS LOGICAL. I AM CONTACTING MEDIA AND ANYONE ELSE I CAN.I TRIED TO TRADE THIS CAR IN AT SEVERAL DEALERS. BOTH OF THESE DEALERS SENT ME A LETTER STATING THAT THEY WOULD NOT TAKE MY CAR IN TRADE AFTER TEST DRIVING IT. THEY SAID IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND UNSAFE. THEY WANT NO PART OF IT. IN ALL OF MY LIFE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS. A NEW CAR COSTING 75K AND THEY WON'T TAKE IT IN TRADE WITH 6000 MILES. NEVER HAVE I HEARD OF THIS.

I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AND STEERING LOCKED UP. THE CAR WAS PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEN TOWED TO THE BMW DEALERSHIP.

THE ERROR DID INDICATE THAT A CERTAIN SOFTWARE LEVEL SHOULD BE LOADED IN THE CAR, BUT THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID I ALREADY HAD THE CORRECT SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED.  THEY RELOADED THE SOFTWARE LEVEL ANYWAY. THE BMW  DEALERSHIP KEPT THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS OF TESTING AND DRIVING, BUT COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. AFTER 3 DAYS, THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY NOTICED THAT I ACTUALLY DID NOT ORIGINALLY HAVE THE LATEST SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL INSTALLED IN MY CAR. SO, THE ONLY FIX PROVIDED BY BMW FOR MY ENGINE MALFUNCTION AND SHUTDOWN WAS LOADING A NEW SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL (PROGRAM I LEVEL NEW F010-10-06-512), THE PREVIOUS SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED IN MY CAR AT THE PLANT WAS PROGRAM I LEVEL PLANT F010-10-06-511.
