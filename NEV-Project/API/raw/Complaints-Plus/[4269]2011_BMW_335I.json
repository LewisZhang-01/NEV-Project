I immediately turned my car off and opened the hood to find more smoke and hearing popping sounds coming from my catalytic converter. The smoke left residue all over my windshield as well as an unpleasant smell lingering in the car. I emailed my local mechanic and he told me this is likely my PCV and not a VCG leak like I thought it was. This problem had scared me from driving my vehicle again because I was worried a fire would start whether I was in the vehicle or not. I took it to my mechanic to get it repaired and was charged $1700 for it. I had no lights or unusual car prior to this happening",

        "summary": "BEFORE I START MY DESCRIPTION I NEED TO MENTION THAT MY CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED FOR ALL RECALL NOTICES RELATED TO THE VEHICLE MAKE AND MODEL!!  ON DECEMBER 15, 2015 MY 2011 BMW 335I SPORT MODEL STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THERE WAS NO WARNING MESSAGES FOR THIS ISSUE.  SEVERAL MINUTES PRIOR TO THE CAR STOPPING I RECEIVED A WARNING MESSAGE THAT MY WIND SHIELD WIPER FLUID WAS LOW.  I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT WITH TRAFFIC ON A CITY STREET APPROXIMATELY 35-40 MPH ON A CLEAR EVENING, NO WEATHER ISSUES. THE STEARING WHEEL BECAME HARD TO TURN AND WHEN PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELLERATE AND IT SLOWED DOWN .  I PUT MY FLASHERS ON AND MOVED TO A SAFE LANE WHERE THERE WE NO CARS DRIVING, PUT THE CAR IN PARK, TURNED IT OFF AND REMOVED THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION AND WAITED FOR A MINUTE.   I CHECKED MY VEHICLE STATUS MENU TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ISSUES, WHICH THERE WE NONE INDICATED.  I PUT THE KEY BACK INTO THE IGNITION, PRESSED THE GAS AND THE CAR STARTED.  I DROVE ABOUT A QUARTER MILE TO A PARKING LOT AND CALLED BMW ASSIST TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AND ASK IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE VEHICLE THAT COULD CHECK THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS ISSUE TO OCCUR. THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL AND I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AT THAT TIME BUT I SHOULD BRING THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER ON DECEMBER 17TH AND WAITED WHILE IT WAS CHECKED.  THEY COULDN'T FIND A REASON FOR THE OCCURANCE. THIS TYPE OF ISSUE IS NOT STORED ON MY BMW KEY WITH IT HAPPENS.  THE ISSUE HAS NOT OCCURRED SINCE 12/15/15 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL OCCUR AGAIN DURING MY CITY OR HIGHWAY DRIVING.  THERE MUST BE A REASON THAT THE CAR STOPPED AND I'M ENTERING THIS ISSUE IN HOPES THAT TESTING WILL BE DONE ON MY MODEL YEAR TO DETERMINE IF THIS WAS CUASED BY A SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE ISSUE.    PLEASE CONTACT ME IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED.   *JS",

THE TIRE SHOP FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TIRE AND SAID TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  THE DEALER FINALLY FOUND THE PROBLEM BY DUNKING IT INTO A WATER TANK....A CRACKED RIM...CRACKED ON THE INSIDE....THIS WAS CAUSING THE AIR TO LEAK OUT MORE AND MORE AS I DROVE.  IT WAS TO THE POINT THAT I WAS FILLING UP AIR EVERY DAY.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT I PROBABLY HIT A POTHOLE AND THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, SO I FIGURED THEY WERE RIGHT AND PAID FOR THE NEW RIM.  NOW SEVERAL MONTHS LATER (AND DOING VERY CAREFUL DRIVING TO ENSURE I DON'T HIT ANY POTHOLES OR ROUGH SURFACES), I FOUND THE OTHER REAR TIRE DOING THE SAME THING.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO CREVIER BMW AND TOLD THEM I SUSPECTED IT MIGHT BE CRACKED TOO. THEY RETURNED THE CAR TO ME WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND TOLD ME IT JUST NEEDED AIR, AND EVERYTHING WAS OK.  TODAY (THE VERY NEXT DAY), I DROVE TO WORK AND MY TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR SAID THE SAME TIRE WAS LOW.  I IMMEDIATELY ADDED AIR 46 PSI PER BMW DOOR LABEL...AND GOT ON FWY TO GO HOME.  WITHIN 5 MINUTES ON THE FWY, MY WHEEL WAS MAKING A HORRIBLE VIBRATION AS IF IT WAS ABOUT TO COME APART. I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF FWY AND GOT A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE ME BACK TO DEALER.
