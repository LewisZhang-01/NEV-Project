It was extremely dangerous trying to find somewhere to pull over with very little engine power.   It has happened several times now.  Vehicle is now longer safe for freeway use.  It also happened once mid corner which upsets the chassis and is quite dangerous on a motorcycle.  Dealer performed a software update and cleared codes on 10/29/2020 which clearly did not fix anything.  No warning is given.  Power is just suddenly removed.",
