I LEARNED THROUGH ON-LINE RESEARCH THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM RELATING TO POOR DESIGN OF THE ABS PUMP MOTOR BRUSHES THAT FAIL TO MAKE GOOD CONTACT RESULTING IN A LOW VOLTAGE SITUATION AND PUMP FAILURE. THE RESULT - THE ABS SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK. THE ESTIMATED COST OF REPLACING THE UNIT IS APPROX. $2200. THE MECHANIC TAPPED ON THE MOTOR HOUSING AND FREED UP THE BRUSHES BUT IT WAS A TEMPORARY FIX THAT LASTED ABOUT 200 MILES. IT THEN BECAME AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 400 MILES BEFORE IT WENT BACK TO BEING THE CONSTANT PROBLEM THAT I AM NOW FORCED TO FIX OR RIDE WITHOUT ABS BRAKES.    THIS IS A WELL KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED PROBLEM BUT BMW HAS NOT ADMITTED ANY PROBLEMS RELATED TO DESIGN OF THE UNIT. THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE IN THE WAY THE BRUSHES SLIDE IN A GROOVED GUIDE OR KEY WAY . APPARENTLY THE GROOVES GET DIRTY AND THE BRUSHES HANG UP AND DON'T REACH THE PROPER POSITION FOR GOOD CONTACT WITH THE MOTOR ARMATURE IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY.    MODULEMASTER IN MOSCOW, IDAHO, REBUILDS THE UNITS AND PROVIDES A 5 YR GUARANTEE. THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE BUSY WITH THESE UNITS.    MY MECHANIC ACTUALLY SENT IN 2 OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. THE SECOND UNIT WAS FROM A GS MODEL. AND THERE ARE OTHER MODELS EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE.     IT IS MY OPINION THAT NHTSA NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND CAUSE BMW TO FIX THE POOR DESIGN AND ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM OF ABS FAILURE.
