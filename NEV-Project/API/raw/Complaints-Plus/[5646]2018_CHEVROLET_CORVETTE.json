This did nothing for the problem. During this time the drivers side tires would lose tire pressure faster than what is acceptable. At no time did the dealer mention the wheel cracking and warping problem experienced by this model vehicle. A year later I am experiencing excessive air leakage on three wheels. Upon further inspection I have found that the three tires have stress cracks. If I had known about the wheel defect I would have taken action sooner. I find this to be a dangerous safety related policy by GM to not alert the owners of these vehicles to the widespread problem.",

A new wheel was ordered by Bob Huff Chevy and installed by them. GM is well aware of the cracked wheels and refuse to do anything about it calling the bad wheels a result of road hazards and potholes etc. When the tire loses air the low tire warning light comes on and more air must be installed but as i was stranded on Easter Saturday and Sunday waiting too order a new wheel making it impossible to travel as i could only get about 25 miles after putting additional air in the tire.",

WE REQUESTED THE WARRANTY CLAIM BE ESCALATED TO GM. GM RESPONDED (REFERENCE ATTACHED PDF) THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. THEY FAILED TO PROVIDE ANY REASONS AS TO WHY IT WAS NOT COVERED.

GM BLAMES THE DEALER FOR POOR MAINTENANCE BUT NEITHER WILL REPLACE BECAUSE THEY SAY IT'S ONLY 'COSMETIC' ACCORDING TO THEM. THEY DID ADVISE ME TO REPLACE THE ROTORS MYSELF AT A COST OF $4000 ON A BRAND NEW CAR! IT HAS HAD THE BAND SINCE DAY 1! WHEN THE CAR IS WASHED OR THE ROTOR GETS WET IT FUSES TO THE PADS AND LOCKS THE WHEEL.  YOU HAVE TO ROCK THE CAR GET IT TO BREAK LOOSE.  THEY KEEP REFERENCING A GM SERVICE BULLETIN THAT PROHIBITS DEALERS FROM REPLACING OR RESURFACING RUSTED ROTORS.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL SURFACE RUST.  IT IS PERMANENT AND IS COMPROMISING THE BRAKE PADS! THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY CONCERN.",
