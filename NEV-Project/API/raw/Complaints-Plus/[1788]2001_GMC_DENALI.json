I WAS ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE A PARKING LOT WHEN I THOUGHT MY ENGINE HAD STALLED BECAUSE I HAD NO POWER STEERING. HAD THE TIMING IN THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING BEEN IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC FOR ME, MY FAMILY AND/OR OTHERS !!! I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO KELLER AUTOMOTIVE IN SHELBY TOWNSHIP, MI. AFTER I HAD CAUSED JIM CAUSLEY PONTIC IN MT. CLEMENS MICHIGAN TO FIND OUT IF THIS ITEM MIGHT STILL BE UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER I FOUND OUT IT WASN'T I TOOK IT TO KELLERS WHERE THEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I BELIEVE THEY STATED THAT IT WAS THE SHAFT IN THE POWER STEERING PUMP THAT FAILS. THOUGH THEY DID SAY THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IT OFTEN IN MY MODEL THEY SAID IT WAS SEEN IN OTHER LIGHT DUTY GM TRUCKS THAT SHARE THE SAME POWER STEERING PUMP. THEY STATED TO ME THAT GM HAS UPGRADED THEIR PUMPS TO HAVE A HEAVIER DUTY SHAFT WHICH WAS $394 FOR THE PART ALONE. IF THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM I WOULD DEFINITELY CONSIDER IT A SAFETY ISSUE AND EXPECT GM TO ANNOUNCE A RECALL REGARDING THIS ISSUE. I WILL HOLD ON TO MY RECEIPT IN HOPES THAT GM WOULD COME TO THE TABLE REGARDING RESOLVING THIS ISSUE OR THAT THE NHTSA COULD POSSIBLY FORCE THE ISSUE IF NECCESSARY. IF THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT I'M SORRY FOR WASTING YOUR TIME BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE BEFORE THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF LIFE OCCURS IF I AM CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON,  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HELP !!,  SINCERELY,   PERRY M.

BEING SO CLOSE TO HOME, HE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME.   MY HUSBAND ALSO NOTICED THAT AN AXLE SEAL WAS LEAKING AS WELL AND THIS WAS ALSO CONSIDERED COMMON FOR PROBLEMS.   WE USE THIS VEHICLE AS OUR ONLY FAMILY CAR, SO NATURALLY WE HAD IT FIXED RIGHT AWAY.  WHAT REALLY CONCERNED AND ALERTED MYSELF TO THIS COMPLAINT WAS WHEN MY HUSBAND TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO GET LOOKED AT A MECHANIC TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAVE FIXED THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS MANY TIMES BEFORE AND IT WOULD ONLY TAKE TWO HOURS.   WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE, I ASKED FOR MYSELF AGAIN, AND THE SAME MECHANIC TOLD ME IT IS VERY COMMON WITH THESE VEHICLES (SUV\"S)  WHY DID  THIS HAPPENED WITH ONLY 60,000 MILES?  THIS IS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING AND IS SOMEWHAT UPSETTING.  I AM VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE I AM RELOCATING TO TEXAS AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER IF WE WERE TRAVEING WITH THIS VEHICLE AND POSSIBLY A TRAILER ATTACHED.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AS I NOTICED THERE WAS A SIMILAR COMPLAINT BEFORE MINE AND THE SAME VEHICLE MAKE AND YEAR.  I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE A STEERING PUMP WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED.    WE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE USED AFTER IT WAS TURNED IN FROM A LEASE.   I AM CONVINCED THAT I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM ALREADY IN MOTION, ALTHOUGH I CANNOT PROVE IT.    I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS LOOKED INTO AND A RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT IN A TIMELY FASHION.   I MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED THIS BUT CONSIDERING THIS MECHANIC INFORMED ME AND MY HUSBAND THAT HE HAS WORKED ON THESE MANY TIMES BEFORE REALLY CONCERNS ME.   I WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS.",
