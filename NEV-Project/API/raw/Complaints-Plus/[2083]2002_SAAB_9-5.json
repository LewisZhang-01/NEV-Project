FAILURE IS AT THE FOLDING POINT JUST PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO THE TRUNK LID.  CAUSE APPEARS TO BE EXCESSIVE TIGHTNESS OF THE INTERIOR WIRES.  THE RUBBER BOOT WAS ENTIRELY INTACT, SEALED TO CONNECTORS IN THE BODY AND TRUNK LID AND THERE WAS NO VISIBLE INDICATION OF THE INTERNAL FAILURE. WIRES ARE SEPARATE INSIDE THE BOOT UP UNTIL THE TRUNK LID ENTRY WHERE THEY ARE WRAPPED WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE.    THIS WAS DISCOVERED ONLY DURING SERVICE, NOT REPORTED BY SELF-CHECK DISPLAY WHICH ALWAYS REPORTS LIGHT BULB OUTAGES IN TEXT MESSAGES ON THE 2 LINE SAAB INFORMATION DISPLAY (SECONDARY FAILURE).   PRIOR TO DISCOVERY A NUMBER OF CARS HAD ALMOST REAR ENDED THE CAR WHEN BACKING UP (REVERSING LIGHT FAILURE WAS NOT REPORTED OR KNOWN).  CORRECTED TEMPORARILY BY SPLICING IN WIRES AND HEAT WRAPPING, WAITING FOR APPOINTMENT WITH THE SAAB DEALER TO REPLACE THE HARNESS.  *TR",

AS WE APPROACHED THE TOLL PLAZA IN MAYS LANDING, NJ THE CAR STALLED AND BEGAN TO SMOKE.  WE EVACUATED THE CAR.  TOLL PERSONNEL  EXTINGUISHED  THE FIRE  AND SUMMONED THE  LAURELDALE FIRE COMPANY AND THE NJ STATE POLICE. THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE TOLL PERSONNEL PREVENTED A POTENTIAL DISASTER. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO AN IMPOUND LOT IN EGG HARBOR CTIY, NJ .  AFTER A FEW HOURS WE WERE ABLE TO ARRANGE FORA RENTAL  TO TRANSPORT US AND  OUR VACATION BAGGAGE HOME. AT THIS TIME WE DID NOT KNOW THE EXTEND OF DAMAGE TO THE CAR OTHER THAN IT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN TO OUR HOME AND IT WAS A SATURDAY.  THE CLOSEST SAAB DEALER IN CHERRY HILL, NJ WAS NOT OPEN FOR SERVICE CALLS. WE ARRIVED HOME 5 HOURS LATER THAN EXPECTED WITH A RENTAL CAR THAT COST $125/DAY AND $0.20 A MILE + GAS.  WE  DROVEBACK TO NJ IN THE MORNING TO RETURN THE RENTAL  BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT TO INCUR ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENSES.  SUNDAY AUGUST 13 WE TRAVELED BACK TO GALLOWAY, NJ TO RETURN THE RENTAL VEHICLE.  THIS FIRE SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED AND SAAB SHOULD PICK UP ANY EXPENSES RELATING TO A CAR FIRE OF A 2002 VEHICLE WITH 59,518 MILES.  THE CAR HAS BEEN REPAIRED, WE PICKED IT UP FROM THE DEALER IN CHERRY HILL, NJ  AUGUST 19, 2006.  REPAIRSR WERE COVERED BY SAAB ALONG WITH THE TOWING TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE FAILURE OF TWO IGNITION CASSETTES CAUSED A FIRE IN THE CATALYTIC  CONVERTER, DAMAGING THE CONVERTER, EXHAUST PIPE, AND MOUNTS.   SAAB HAS NOT EXPLAINED WHY THE MECHANICAL FAILURE CAUSED THE FIRE AND HAS GIVEN US NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
