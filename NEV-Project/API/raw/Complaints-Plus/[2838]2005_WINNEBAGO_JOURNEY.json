SINCE THE MOTORHOME WAS TWO YEARS OLD (IT SAT ON THE DEALER'S LOT, IN THE OPEN, FOR ONE YEAR BEFORE I PURCHASED IT) WHILE DRIVING IN THE RAIN, WATER DRIPS ONTO THE DASH FROM ABOVE THE LEFT (DRIVER'S) WINDSHIELD.  I CONTACTED WINNEBAGO AND THEY SAID TO PUT SILICON AROUND THE LIGHTS ABOVE THE WINDSHIELD, WHICH I DID.  THE CONDITION REMAINS THE SAME.  THE INTERNET HAS REPORTED THAT THE METAL FRAME AROUND THE GLASS RUSTS OUT CAUSING THE LEAKS.  I WORRY THAT THE ENTIRE WINDOW FRAME HAS RUSTED OUT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE WINDOW BREAKING OR COMING LOOSER.      THE VAST NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM LEADS TO THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF THE WINDSHIELD FRAMES.  THANK YOU  *TR",
