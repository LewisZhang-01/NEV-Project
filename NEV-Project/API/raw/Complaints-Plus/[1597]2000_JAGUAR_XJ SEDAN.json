        "summary": "I OWN A 2000 JAGUAR XJR AND HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE AND THE DEALER/REPAIR FACILITY NOT ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THEM WHICH IN THE END LEFT ME WITH A SEIZED MOTOR AT ONLY 80K MILES. THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS THE CAR GOING INTO \"FAIL SAFE ENGINE MODE\" WHICH MEANS THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START WHATSOEVER FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. TOOK IT TO A REPAIR FACILITY AND SAID IT WAS A LINEAR SWITCH IN THE J GATE SHIFT CONSOLE. $700.00  AND THREE MONTHS LATER THE SAME PROBLEM PERSIST. TOOK IT BACK ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY CANNOT DIAGNOSE WHAT WAS CAUSING THE CAR TO LOCK ITSELF OUT FROM STARTING ITSELF. SECOND I WOULD MERGE ON THE FREEWAY AND OUT OF NOWHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD GO INTO LIMP MODE NEARLY CAUSING A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT. HAD THE REPAIR SHOP DIAGNOSE THAT AND STILL COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. THESE TECHNICAL FAULTS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING ON AND OFF UNTIL THE VEHICLE FINALLY HAD THE CHAIN TENSIONER SNAP CAUSING MY MOTOR TO BASICALLY SEIZE ITSELF. CONTACTED JAGUAR CARS AMERICA AND SAID THE CAR IS TOO OLD AND FAR PAST ITS WARRANTY FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. COMPLETELY UNFAIR CONSIDERING THERE WAS NEVER EVEN A RECALL MADE FOR THE OLD CHAIN TENSIONER. APPARENTLY JAGUAR RE INTRODUCED A NEWER RE MANUFACTURED CHAIN TENSIONER THAT TOOK THE PLACE OF THE OLDER ONES THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLING. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE A MANDATORY RECALL FOR ALL JAGUARS V8'S 98-2000. THESE CARS ARE BASICALLY TICKING TIME BOMBS IF THEY HAD NOT ALREADY HAD THE NEWER CHAIN TENSIONERS INSTALLED. I LOVE THE CAR DEARLY BUT JAGUAR CARS NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THESE FAULTS AND REPAIR THEM ACCORDINGLY. IT IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR FOR ME TO HAVE A VEHICLE I HAVE METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED TAKE A PLUNGE ON ME OUT OF NOWHERE. THE CAR SHOULD NOT REQUIRE A WHOLE NEW MOTOR AT 80K. NOT EVEN IF ITS BEEN NEGLECTED! WHAT KIND OF ENGINEERING IS THIS?!  *TR",

IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC AS IT DID TO A FRIEND WITH A YEAR OLDER.  WITH SUCH FAILURE THE ENGINE STOPS ABRUPTLY, NO MATTER WHERE IT IS.  THIS RISKS SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH INJURY OR DEATH ON HIGHWAYS.  THE GUIDES/TENSIONERS FAIL BEFORE 100K MILES ANY TIME BETWEEN ABOUT 60 AND 95K.  THEY ARE MADE OF PLASTIC.

THIS SITUATION IS A MAJOR TOPIC ON EDMUNDS, AND OTHER SITES.  THIS WAS A MAJOR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING FLAW THAT HAS AFFECTED THIS MODEL FOR YEARS.

MECHANIC DIAGNOSED A FAULT CODE OF P0121 WHICH IS ADDRESSED AS A KNOWN JAGUAR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FOR A \"MISMATCHED\" CONNECTOR TO THE THROTTLE BODY.  INTERNET RESEARCH REVEALS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM EXPERIENCED BY MANY JAGUAR OWNERS THAT IS KNOWN BY JAGUAR AND CONSTITUTES A SAFETY HAZARD.  JAGUAR KNOWS THAT IT MISMATCHED GOLD AND TIN PLATED THROTTLE BODY CONNECTORS AND ADVISED ITS REPAIR TECH'S TO REPLACE ONLY IF CUSTOMER COMPLAINS!  HOW WILL A CUSTOMER KNOW SUCH A PROBLEM EXISTS UNTIL IT HAPPENS AND IT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.  ANYTHING THAT MAY SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING AFFECT A VEHICLE'S ABILITY TO ACCELERATE IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD. JAGUAR SHOULD HAVE AND MUST ISSUE A FULL RECALL OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS CATASTROPHICALLY INJURED AND/OR KILLED.  IT COSTS IN EXCESS OF $450+ TO FIX THIS KNOWN PROBLEM AND JAGUAR IS ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO DRIVE UNSAFE VEHICLES THAT MAY FAIL AT THE WORST TIME.
