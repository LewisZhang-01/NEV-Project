        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING WITH OUR FIFTH WHEEL ATTACHED TO OUR TRUCK IN COLORADO ON OUR WAY TO MONTANA, WE HAD TO AVOID A MASSIVE SNOW STORM IN WYOMING THAT CLOSED I-25 AT THE COLORADO BORDER. WE DROVE EAST ON I-76 AND THEN CUT NORTH ONTO MAJOR US HIGHWAYS TO RAPID CITY, SD. DURING THAT TRIP, WE ENCOUNTERED UNUSUAL, SUSTAINED PERIODS OF HIGH WINDS WITH GUSTS AT 50 MPH PER THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. UNKNOWN TO US AT SOME POINT DURING THAT DRIVE, PART OF OUR ROOF RIPPED OFF. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE LOSS OF PART OF OUR ROOF CAUSED ANY SAFETY ISSUES OR HAZARDS TO OTHER MOTORISTS. THE ATTACHMENTS TELL THE WHOLE STORY REGARDING THE ROOF ISSUE. START WITH THE EMAIL TO KEYSTONE AND SEE THE COMBINED SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS THAT WERE ATTACHED TO THAT EMAIL REGARDING WORK DONE AT THE PURCHASING RV DEALERSHIP UNDER WARRANTY IN OCT 2014 WHICH DID NOT FIX THE ROOF LEAK, EMAILS I SENT TO FAMILY THAT MENTIONED THE CONTINUED ISSUE AND THEN THE INVOICE FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ROOF IN MAY 2016. I'VE ALSO ATTACHED THE DENIAL FROM KEYSTONE OF OUR WARRANTY CLAIM AS WELL AS THE DENIAL OF OUR INSURANCE CLAIM FROM PROGRESSIVE.  APPARENTLY, ROOF ISSUES ARE WELL DOCUMENTED ON KEYSTONE PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, THEY ARE DENYING BEING NOTIFIED IN 2014 THAT WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE ROOF LEAKING, WHICH IS THE REASON FOR DENYING OUR CLAIM.",
