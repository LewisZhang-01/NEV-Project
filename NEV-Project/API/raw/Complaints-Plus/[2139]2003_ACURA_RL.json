THEY REFUSED TO RETURN FIVE MESSAGES, AND WHEN WE I REACHED THEM THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT ITEMS ON THE INVOICE MEANT, SAYING THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO, AND THAT I HAD TO CALL ACURA. I CALLED ACURA AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL THE DEALER. THE INVOICE MENTIONED A DISCONNECTED AIR BAG AND A FAULTY MODULE. BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS PUT ME AND MY PASSENGERS IN DANGER. THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO 'INCREASED PRESSURE IN THE AIRBAG DEFLATOR.'  I FELT I DESERVED AN EXPLANATION BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF INCREASED PRESSURE IS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING. THE ACURA REP TOLD ME SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION. AFTER SOME PRESSURE SHE TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT ACCESS THE DEALER INFORMATION. UPON PRESSURE, SHE READ ME SOME HOUSE INFORMATION THAT SAID THE CONTROL MODULE IS FAULTY AND THAT THEY REPLACED THE INFLATOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  I ASKED HER TO REPEAT THAT. AGAIN SHE USED THE WORD REPLACED. 'REPLACED' IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM 'INSPECTED.' I ASKED FOR A COPY OF THAT DOCUMENTATION, BUT SHE REFUSED. I THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT I ACTUALLY HAD THE FAULTY INFLATOR, BUT THEY REPLACED IT AND REPORTED THAT TO ACURA, AND THEN SIMPLY SENT AN INVOICE TO ME AND MY ATTORNEY SHOWING THE CAR HAD BEEN INSPECTED. I THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT ONCE EVERYBODY SAW IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED, THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE ISSUE AND THE CLASS ACTION SUIT. REGARDLESS, THEY BEHAVED EGREGIOUSLY, MY CAR IS IN THE SAME SHAPE, IF NOT WORSE, THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE INSPECTION, MY PASSENGERS AND I REMAIN IN DANGER, AND I FEAR DRIVING THE CAR EVEN MORE THAN I DID BEFORE.
