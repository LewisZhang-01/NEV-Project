THE FRONT PICKUP POINT FOR THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BROKE FREE OF THE CROSSMEMBER WHICH CAUSED LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE LEFT THE ROAD AND ENTERED A DITCH. NO DAMAGE OTHER THAN THE CORROSION DAMAGE TO THE SUSPENSION MOUNTING POINTS. THIS HAPPENED ON A STRAIGHT, LEVEL COUNTRY ROAD WITH A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH. HAD THIS HAPPENED 5 MINUTES LATER I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON I-74 TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH. IN ORDER TO REPAIR THIS I WILL NEED TO REMOVE THE COMPLETE SUSPENSION ON BOTH SIDES, REMOVE THE STEERING RACK, REMOVE THE RADIATOR AND REPLACE THE CROSSMEMBER WITH A NEW PART. PART IS AVAILABLE, AND AT THIS POINT FAILED PARTS ARE STILL INSTALLED ON THE VEHICLE. *JB",
