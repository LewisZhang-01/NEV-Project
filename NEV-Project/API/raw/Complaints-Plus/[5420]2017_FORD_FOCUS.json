He also said that the invoice wasn't complete and he would e-mail it to me. So far, I haven't received it.    June 22, 2021, My husband [XXX] contacted Ford Customer Care  and obtained a case number from [XXX].

Attempts to contact her at [XXX] and get a written response have also failed. Each time I have been told that it is within specification and fixing it is not under warranty. I also have been told that it can be fixed now if I pay for it. The cost was estimated at $3,000.

WHEN I PICKED MY CAR UP I WAS TOLD A NEW ELECTRONIC COMPONENT WAS INSTALLED IN(?) THE TRANSMISSION THAT WOULD RECORD AND ADAPT TO MY DRIVING STYLE, ALLOWING A MUCH SMOOTHER TRANSITION BETWEEN GEAR SHIFTS, SOLVING THE SHUDDERING. WHATEVER THEY DID WORKED FOR ABOUT A WEEK, JUST LONG ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE MANUFACTURER WARRANTY EXPIRED.

I SHUT OFF THE CAR AND LET IT SIT A FEW MINUTES THEN CHECKED OIL. WHEN I DID, THE OIL SHOWED FULL. I THEN CALLED THE FORD DEALER I TAKE MY CAR TO FOR OIL CHANGES AND SPOKE WITH A SERVICE GUY AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE WAS PUZZLED AND ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN WE TRIED TO RESET THE OIL LIGHT. AFTER DOING THE RESET THE OIL LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I TRIED STARTING THE CAR AND IT STARTED FINE. NO ABNORMAL SOUNDS COMING FROM THE ENGINE AND IT IDLED FINE. I DECIDED TO TRY THE FREEWAY AGAIN TO SEE IF THE OIL LIGHT WAS A FLUKE. THE NEXT EXIT WAS ONLY A HALF MILE AWAY SO I COULD EASILY GET OFF FREEWAY IF NECESSARY. AGAIN, THE FREEWAY WAS ONLY ABOUT 30 YDS AWAY SO WHEN I STARTED TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED. THE CAR ACCELERATED SLOWLY AND THEN BOGGED DOWN AND THE DASH FLASHED THE ENGINE NEEDED ATTENTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AGAIN I GOT OFF AT THE NEXT EXIT, WHICH WAS RIGHT THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE FORD DEALER NEAR WHERE I LIVE. SERVICE WAS CLOSED BUT SOME SALES PEOPLE WERE STILL THERE AND THEY TOLD US WHERE TO PUT THE CAR. THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE CAR UNTIL MONDAY AND EVEN THEN THEY DIDN'T REALLY OPEN THE CAR UP AND LOOK AT IT. THE TECHNICIAN SAID PROBABLY THE TIMING/OIL PUMP BELT BROKE OR SHREDDED AND CLOGGED UP THE OIL PUMP.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO GET IT FIXED UNDER WARRANTY, AND THEY REPLACED THE CLUTCH. FOR ABOUT A WEEK, IT WAS FINE. THEN IT STARTED TO DO THE SAME THING AGAIN. IT WILL JERK BACK AND FORTH WHEN I ACCELERATE FROM A COMPLETE STOP (AT A STOPLIGHT FOR EXAMPLE). RECENTLY, I HAVE BEEN LOSING GAS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY PAST 4RPMS JUST TO GET FROM 0-20MPH. I'M NOT SURE IF THE WARRANTY IS STILL ON IT, BUT IT ONLY HAS 12,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE ONLY MADE ONE VERY BIG TRIP WITH IT, TO KANSAS AND BACK TO VIRGINIA. IT DOES THIS OFF AND ON EVERY SINGLE TIME I DRIVE IT. I HAVE TO DRIVE ANYWHERE FROM 25 MINUTES TO AN HOUR FOR WORK, SO THIS IS REALLY NOT CONVENIENT TO HAVE. MULTIPLE TIMES I WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BREAK DOWN AS I STRUGGLED TO KEEP IT FROM OVERDOING ITSELF WHILE ACCELERATING. A FEW TIMES, I COULD SMELL SOMETHING LIKE EXHAUST IN THE VENTS. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE COURSE OF 6 MONTHS AND HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE, EVEN AFTER TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND HAVING THEM TELL ME IT WAS \"FIXED.\"",

THE PROBLEM WAS MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN TURNING ONTO A ROAD WHILE ACCELERATING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC, AND THE SHUDDERING WAS STRONGER AT THE END OF A DRIVE THAN AT THE BEGINNING. GRADUALLY THE SYMPTOMS BECAME MORE SEVERE, UNTIL I DID NOT FEEL SAFE MERGING INTO TRAFFIC AT NORMAL SPEEDS. AT THAT POINT I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER DID A ROAD TEST AND INSPECTION AND CONCLUDED THE CLUTCH NEEDED REPLACEMENT. THE PART WAS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER AND TOOK 8 WEEKS TO ARRIVE; IN THE MEANTIME I HAD TO CONTINUE DRIVING MY FOCUS WITH ITS DEFECT. THE DEALER REPLACED THE CLUTCH AND HALF-SHAFT SEALS UNDER WARRANTY AT NO CHARGE. THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED, AND HAS NOT REOCCURRED.",
