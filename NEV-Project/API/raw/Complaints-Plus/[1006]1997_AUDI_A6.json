I'M POSITIVE THE SLIGHTEST SPARK WOULD'VE IGNITED THE FUEL, THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE CAR, MY NEIGHBORS AND MY GARAGE.     I TOOK VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC, HE POINTED OUT THE LEAK, A PORT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE TANK THAT HAS A HOSE ATTACHED TO IT IS CRACKED. HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THE GAS WAS LEAKING ON MY EXHAUST, TRAVELING UP THE EXHAUST TOWARD THE ENGINE, I WAS LUCKY THAT THE HEAT DIDN'T IGNITE THE GAS.    MECHANIC TOLD ME THERE HAS BEEN RECALLS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE, AFTER CALLING, WERE INFORMED THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE RECALL THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED.    AFTER DOING HOURS OF RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND COUNTLESS OTHER VW/AUDI OWNERS COMPLAINING THEIR VEHICLE NOT INCLUDED IN RECALL EVEN THOUGH ITS THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THE SAME PART!! BY USING THE AUDI PARTS WEBSITE TO LOOK UP OTHER MODELS ITS EASY TO SEE THEY USE FUEL TANKS THAT HAVE THE SAME DESIGN ISSUE BUT NOT COVERED IN RECALL.    PLEASE GET VW/AUDI TO INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES THAT HAVE THE FUEL TANKS WITH THE VALVE NIPPLES THAT HAVE PROVEN TO FAIL OVER AND OVER. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE ARE REPORTS OF PART FAILURE AFTER RECALL HAS BEEN PREFORMED AND AUDI IS REFUSING TO FIX THE ISSUE AFTER THE FACT FORCING OWNERS TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.     JUST BECAUSE NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT A MAKE/MODEL THAT IS USING THE SAME DESIGN FLAWED PART SHOULDN'T BE AN EXCUSE NOT TO ISSUE OR INCLUDE IN A RECALL!
