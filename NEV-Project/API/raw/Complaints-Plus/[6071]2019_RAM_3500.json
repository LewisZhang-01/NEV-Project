All 6 tires on the truck are identical and had approximately 14,000 miles on them when the driver's side front tire failed. The tires were recently rotated approximately 3-4 weeks prior to failure. The tire that failed was previously located on the Passenger Side Front prior to rotation. I began noticing vibration in the steering wheel at speeds approximately 40-45 mph and higher. I monitored this vibration for a few days in various driving conditions in an attempt to diagnose the problem and noticed that the vibration increased with vehicle speed.   Soon, the problem became worse and the entire vehicle began vibrating. The last day of the evaluation period I was towing a Tandem Axle 16ft open Car Trailer with an SUV loaded on the trailer at speeds as high as 75 mph on the interstate. The next day I took the truck to the local dealer who informed me that the steel belt had separated on the inside of the tire and would require replacement.   After conducting research on tire separation, I discovered the serious safety concern where the tire could have blown out which would have surely caused a serious accident. I also discovered that this separation failure is very common with this same combination of Nexen Tires on Heavy Duty Ram Pickup Trucks. I had the spare tire mounted until an identical replacement tire was delivered to the dealer for install. I paid $282.42 out of pocket for the tire replacement and after arguing with the dealer, they filed a warranty claim with Nexen. Weeks later I was informed that they have offered to reimburse approximately $113, but to date I have not received any funds and I still have 6 Nexen of these Nexen tires on my truck plus the spare.",

The RAM dually and other sites are full of photos and stories of the tires failing. These truck are used for towing large RV and other trailers so the risk due to failing tires is huge. We had hoped to get a few miles out of them before replacing them for peace of mind. Didn't happen though we had the front and inside dual on the passenger side fail at 14,866 miles. The front began to wobble and shake the front end of the truck. I noticed it on 10/12/2021 and on the 13th the truck was shaking so badly I drove the 15 or so miles to Discount tire at 30mph. Discount tire inspected the tire and immediately noticed the tire belts were separating and the tire was about to blow apart. They then found the inside passenger side dual was separating as well. We pulled and replaced all 6 tires. No way we could trust our safety to the RAM stock NEXEN tires. Please look into this further. The number of reports does not reflect the numbers of failures on the road. Many of the truck buyers just immediately replace the NEXEN tires on delivery of their RAM trucks! $200 for a new front end alignment and $1,600 for tires on a new truck but we are safe.",

THE BOSCH CP4.2 FUEL INJECTION PUMP HAS A VERY HIGH RATE OF SUDDEN FAILURE LEADING TO IMMEDIATE STOPPAGE ON THE ENGINE AND ENGINE BRAKING SYSTEM. THE PUMP DESTROYS ITSELF AND TAKES OUT THE REST OF THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM LEADING TO REPAIRS IN THE $20,000 USD RANGE. FCA & RAM HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REVISE THE PUMP IN LATE (JULY) 2020 TO SOLVE THE ISSUE BUT THE FAILURES KEEP OCCURRING. FOR THE 2021 MODEL YEAR, FCA & RAM HAVE CHANGED THE PUMP ENTIRELY AND REVERTED BACK TO USING AN OLDER, SAFER, MORE RELIABLE DESIGN. NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEITHER THE PUMP REVISION IN 2020, NOR THE PUMP CHANGE IN 2021 HAVE BEEN MADE. THE ISSUE IS SO PREVALENT THAT THE REPLACEMENT PUMPS AND REPAIRS GENERALLY HAVE A 30-90 DAY WAIT PERIOD WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS WITHOUT THE PRIMARY VEHICLE. THIS PROBLEM IS A SUBSTANTIATED SAFETY RISK. ACCORDING TO A TEXAS JUDGE IN A BOSCH CP4.2 LAWSUIT, WHEN ANOTHER AUTOMAKER, GM TRIED TO DISMISS THE CASE SAYING THE PUMP FAILURE IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, THE COURT RESPONDED: \"THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF A TRUCK SPONTANEOUSLY STALLING AT HIGH SPEEDS IS NOT A MERE INCONVENIENCE. NOR IS IT A MERE INCONVENIENCE TO SPEND BETWEEN $8,000 TO $20,000 ON REPAIRS TO MAKE THE TRUCKS FIT FOR THEIR ORDINARY PURPOSE. THE COURT REJECTS GM'S SUGGESTION THAT THE RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ENGINE FAILURE WHILE DRIVING IS NOT, AS A MATTER OF LAW, UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS, DEPRIVING THE VEHICLES OF FITNESS FOR THEIR PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTATION.\". TOYOTA AGREES: \"IF A VEHICLE STALL OCCURS WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THIS COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH\". FCA & RAM HAVE REMEDIED THE SITUATION FOR THE 2021 MODEL YEAR HOWEVER, THE 2019 AND 2020 OWNERS ARE STILL AT RISK. THE NHTSA NEEDS TO FORCE FCA TO RECALL THESE TRUCKS.",
