THIS HAS HAPPENED 2 TIMES SINCE OWNERSHIP.  WAS TOLD BY THE LINCOLN DEALER THAT IT WAS A DEFECT IN DESIGN AND THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPAIR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE PROBLEM, BUT ONLY IF THE CAR WAS STILL \"IN WARRANTY\". THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE DRAIN HOLES IN THE SUNROOF THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR PROPER DRAINING.  I HAVE TALKED TO ONE OTHER OWNER OF AN FORD EXPEDITION AND FOUND HE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  HE WAS ALSO TOLD IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE SUNROOF. I THINK FORD WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND SHOULD HAVE ADVISED ME AND ALL OTHERS BEFORE WE PURCHASED THE CAR.  EVERYTIME IT RAINS HEAVY THE RAIN LEAKS INTO THE VEHICLE AND I AM AFRAID IT WILL CAUSE AN ELECTRICAL SHORT AND FIRE IN THE CAR. THE WATER TRAVELS DOWN THE HEADLINER INTO THE DASHBOARD AREA AND ALSO THE DVD AS STATED ABOVE. IF YOU CAN LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE EFFECTIVE BY THIS I WOULD APPRCIATE IT.
