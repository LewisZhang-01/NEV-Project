I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TRAILBLAZER HOME AND IT DUMPED GAS ON MY DRIVEWAY.   I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THE NHTSA APPROVED THIS VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR ONLY A EXTENSION.  IF YOU GO ON THE INTERNET THERE ARE MANY OF THESE VEHICLES THAT HAVE THIS ISSUE!  IT WAS A FAULTY PART AND COULD HAVE BEEN LIFE THREATENING!  AND OF COURSE A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR! THAT WAS PASSED DOWN TO CAR OWNERS, WHEN I BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURER NEEDED TO FIX THIS, WHEN DISCOVERED, NOT JUST IF IT FAILS WITHIN LIMITS!
