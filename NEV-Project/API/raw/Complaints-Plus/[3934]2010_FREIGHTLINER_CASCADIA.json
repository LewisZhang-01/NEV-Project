I AM ENGINEER MYSELF AND, AFTER A WHOLE YEAR I CAME TO A CLEAR CONCLUSION THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK ON ROAD WITH POOR CONDITIONS LIKE BUMPY OR SLIPPERY. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT TRUCK DRIVERS TAKE THE BLAME FROM THEIR COMPANY FOR THIS AND IT IS RISKY. TRUCK DRIVING IS BY ITSELF IS VERY STRESSFUL, AND IT BECOME A REAL HAZARD WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO HIT THE BRAKE BECAUSE OF A HARD BRAKING SYSTEM THAT PUT THEM INTO TROUBLE WITH THEIR BOSS. AS RESULT WE WILL HAVE CRASHES THAT COULD BE AVOIDED.   WHAT I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO SLOW DOWN ON BUMPY OR SLIPPERY ROAD THE ABS SYSTEM GETS ACTUATED, THE IT RECORDS A HARD BRAKING EVENT, WHICH IS WRONG. THE SYSTEM NEEDS BETTER JUDGMENT WITH POOR ROAD CONDITIONS. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT WILL NEED MORE SENSORS AND A SOFTWARE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE HERE.   IF THE SYSTEM WAS NOT AIMED AT SCARING DRIVERS I THINK IT SHOULD BE CORRECTED BEFORE IT KILLS MANY AMERICANS.
