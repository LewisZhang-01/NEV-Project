THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 30 MPH AND WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED TO AMBER, I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE SLIGHTLY HARDER THAN USUAL.   WHEN THIS HAPPENED TWO OF THE LINES FROM THE ABS CONTROLLER TO THE WHEELS LEAKED AND BRAKE FLUID WAS SPRAYED ON THE EXHAUST SYSTEM CREATING MUCH SMOKE.  SINCE THERE WAS NO CROSS TRAFFIC A COLLISION WAS AVOIDED.      THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED FOR REPAIRS AND ALL OF THE HOSES FROM THE ABS CONTROLLER SHOW SIGNIFICANT SIGNS OF RUST.   THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW AND USED IN FLORIDA.  IT HAS BEEN IN MICHIGAN FOR ONLY TWO YEARS AND HAS HAD MINIMAL EXPOSURE TO WINTER WEATHER AND SALT.",
