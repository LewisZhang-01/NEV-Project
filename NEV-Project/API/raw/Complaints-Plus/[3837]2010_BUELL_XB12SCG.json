        "summary": "I'M REPORTING A DESIGN FLAW, NOT A SPECIFIC INCIDENT.  THIS MOTORCYCLE HAS AN UNDER ENGINE MUFFLER THAT DIRECTS HOT EXHAUSTS ONTO THE RIDERS LEFT FOOT/LOWER LEG WHEN STOPPED.  EVEN WORSE IS THE RIDER IS BREATHING EXHAUST WHILE STOPPED AT LIGHTS/STOP SIGNS.  OBVIOUSLY ONE HAS TO HAVE ON LONG PANTS AND BOOTS TO ENSURE THE EXHAUST CANT BURN THEM.    MANY OTHER MAKES OF MOTORCYCLES HAVE GONE TO THIS DESIGN TOO AND IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.  THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EXHAUST PIPE THAT TAKES THE EXHAUST TO THE BACK OF THE BIKE,  JUST LIKE ON CARS WHERE THE EXHAUST MUST COME OUT BEHIND THE CAR, NOT UNDER IT.  THE MUFFLER LOCATION IS NOT THE ISSUE PER SE BUT THE LACK OF AN EXHAUST PIPE COMING OUT OF THE MUFFLE TO MOVE THE EXHAUST TO THE REAR OF THE BIKE IS THE PROBLEM.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS FOR ALL BIKE MAKERS, NOT JUST BUELL.    BTW, HARLEY USES ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ENGINES IN THEIR BIKES AS BUELL(WHICH WAS OWNED BY HD UNTIL HD SHUT THEM DOWN) AND THEY PUT FULL LENGTH EXHAUSTS ON THEIR BIKES SO IT WOULD BE AN EASY FIX FOR THEM TO PUT PROPER EXHAUSTS ON ALL THE BUELLS THEY MADE THAT EXHAUST ONTO RIDERS LEFT FOOT.  *TR",
