That is annoying, but to me is not a safety issue, so wasn't too concerned about it. What is going on with our driver side sliding door now I do believe is a safety issue and needs to be part of a recall. The driver side sliding door was refusing to unlock, or open sometimes but now it is all the time. We are unable to manually unlock it to use the door. It is stuck in the lock position and totally unusable now as we are unable to manually unlock it by hand and unable to unlock it using the door locks, or the the remote. The lights flash when i click the button on the remote to open that door, but it doesn't respond and unlock it. What is gonna happen when the other door decides to do the same thing and no one can get out of the van in the case of an emergency. This needs to be a recall and be fixed for all the families that drive and love your vans. We've never had an issue like this with our previous years of Dodge vans. I got the warranty thing in the mail for this to be fixed with 150,000 miles, or less. At the time I got the letter ours was only doing the buzzing sound on the one door, but it already had 160,000 miles on it, so it was past the warranty time to get fixed.

The Dodge dealer wants to replace the entire box of fuses at a cost of 1000-1500.   It is a known problem affecting thousands of users. So much of a known problem that there is a website that is selling electronic modules that kill the fuel pump when the key is off. VerticleVisions.com is a website selling a hack to solve the Dodge issue.  Apparently there had been a recall of other models and years but not my make or model.  Quoting a Youtuber \"As you may know, there has been a recall on certain models of Jeep and Dodge vehicles due to fuel pump relay failures.   Other vehicles in the Chrysler and Jeep umbrella may utilize the exact TIPM containing the failing embedded relay as the vehicles listed in the recall, they are NOT listed in the VIN specific recall.  To exacerbate the issue, the replacement part manufactured by Mopar is explicitly reserved for only the VINs for the vehicle models and years listed in the recall, so try as you might to order one online or have it serviced at the dealer, Mopar will not send one without a matching VIN. Further worsening the situation, the newest version of the bypass kit is on back order for months, leaving nearly everyone that actually HAS a VIN listed in the recall in as terrible a situation as the rest of us.   Aside from a brand new TIPM for nearly $1,200.00 or a junkyard or eBay score for a used one, if your vehicle intermittently cranks but does not start or starts but immediately dies, and is noticeably worse in cold weather and mornings, here is the best solution to bypass the relay altogether and get yourself on the road or off the side of it. Relays are important and without one, you could damage your fuel pump. Please consider this as you look to the future.\" This is a safety hazard and should be recalled by the manufacturer.

My youngest is beside the driver's side sliding door, the one I have having the issue with now.  Right now, unless I reach over and behind the driver's seat or walk around the car to the opposite door, I CAN NOT REACH MY CHILD'S CAR SEAT!!!! Not only is this extremely inconvenient and time consuming, IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! What if my son needs help with something and I need to reach him? What if he is choking? What if we are in an accident and I need to get him out of his car seat? When searching this issue online, it quickly became evident THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT DODGE KNOWS ABOUT AND HASN'T RECALLED!!! I was beyond shocked and appalled! How could this issue be common and known - it's ALL OVER the Internet, and not be acknowledged by Dodge??? Is my children's safety not worthy of a recall? Is this just a money making scheme? ARE THEY WAITING FOR A CHILD TO DIE TO DO A RECALL? The majority of people who buy minivans have young children and need the convenience of sliding doors. So the majority of people at-risk with this issue are children. This is blatant neglect on the part of Dodge and needs to be called out and have Dodge recall it as soon as possible before something bad happens. Thank you for your help in this matter.",

While the door and lock still operate, it makes a loud buzzing noise whenever it is activated (as described in the 2016 TSB issued by the manufacturer.) My mechanic inspected and confirmed this problem in September 2021. Just the other day (10/20/21), the actuator on the rear driver door also failed without any warning (it had never made noise): the lock \u201cseized\u201d and we were unable to unlock and open the door through any means. This exact pattern of failure has been reported by many other owners of this vehicle. Malfunctioning locks present an obvious safety problem, especially in the case of the locked door which would make it difficult for my children to escape the car quickly in an emergency. Neither actuator has been replaced yet and thus they are available for inspection if necessary.",

The exact same problem occurred with the passenger side sliding door in December 2018.  I personally performed the repair of that door.  The problem was a failed door lock actuator.  It had a faulty actuator gear.  I believe this problem potentially puts the occupants of the vehicle at high risk by obstructing exiting of the vehicle in an emergency situation, especially in a situation where the opposite door was inoperable or obstructed during an accident.",

It appears the RPMs would go past 4 then the gear would change but with less power. Then the check engine light came on.  Various times while i was stopped at a light upon acceleration the car would turn off. I took it down to the repair shop for the computer analyzation and was told to change the ignition coils and spark plugs and any and all air filters and check the sensors. The Performance did improve and I discovered the engine mounts were all in need of repair and that was the cause of the transmission stalling. I had those repaired and now the gears work fine. And now after spending quite a bit of money  notice another issue. When I am getting out of my drive way and go from Reverse then stop to Drive there is a stall and the transmission does a clunk sound before it changes gear to drive. It very dangerous due to the fact that the gear stall and if the drive gear does not kick it any passing car may hit my van",

        "summary": "I am writing today with a serious safety issue on our 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan. Our van has rear power sliding doors and locks; recently the drivers side rear door has stopped sliding and will not unlock at all, either with the key or manually. APPARENTLY  this is a WELL-KNOWN  ISSUE ; the dealer has stated that they will take a look at a vehicle for repair but we will have to pay the $200 diagnostic fee and approximately $1300-1700 to have the door repaired. THIS  IS A COMMON  FACTORY  DEFECT that is also a SEVERE  SAFETY  HAZARD . I have two young children; if I was hit on the passenger side of the vehicle, how could I possibly get my children out of the car safely? If it was simply a power vs. Manual door issue, we wouldn't mind. However, the door will NOT OPEN  AT ALL!!  Now the passengers side rear slide door is making  really loud noises, . Loud enough to startle people walking by or in the van trying to get out. So, it is also about to go out and that will leave no way in to the side of the van where my children and elderly parents sit to get them out and it will be another  $1300- $1700 to fix. Will it take the Death of a child for Dodge to issue a recall on the common problem? Even the repair tech at the dealer said that it happens all the time. This is not right and not safe for families.  After a quick search I have found so many more people that have the same exact problem and Dodge still isn't willing to help. Please contact me if you need more information.  Thank You",

This is dangerous because we had assumed that the door was locked when we pushed the electrical lock button in the van or on the fob.

I DON'T SEE HOW THERE IS AN ACTIVE RECALL THAT INCLUDES MY MAKE AND YEAR AND VEHICLE TYPE BUT EXCLUDES MY VIN. IF I HAD BEEN AWARE OF A RECALL  A SMALL REPAIR COULD HAVE BEEN MADE. NOW MY VEHICLE NEEDS AN ENTIRE NEW TRANSMISSION.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DEADLY IF MY VEHICLE  DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. A CARAVAN IS SOLD SPECIFICALLY AS A FAMILY VEHICLE.

APPARENTLY THIS IS A WELL-KNOWN ISSUE; THE DEALER HAS STATED THAT THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT A VEHICLE FOR REPAIR BUT WE WILL HAVE TO PAY THE $100 DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND APPROXIMATELY $1100-1300 TO HAVE THE DOOR REPAIRED. THIS IS A COMMON FACTORY DEFECT THAT IS ALSO A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD. I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN; IF I WAS HIT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE, HOW COULD I POSSIBLY GET MY CHILDREN OUT OF THE CAR SAFELY? IF IT WAS SIMPLY A POWER VS. MANUAL DOOR ISSUE, WE WOULDN'T MIND. HOWEVER, THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN AT ALL. NOT ONLY IS THE INCONVENIENCE SEVERE WITH TWO CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS, BUT THE SAFETY ISSUE IS UNCONSCIONABLE. WILL IT TAKE THE DEATH OF A CHILD FOR DODGE TO ISSUE A RECALL ON THE COMMON PROBLEM? EVEN THE REPAIR TECH AT THE DEALER SAID THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. THIS IS NOT RIGHT AND NOT SAFE FOR FAMILIES.

SINCE THERE ARE NO MANUAL LOCKS, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ALL DOORS BE LOCKED AND MY FAMILY (3 KIDS) WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT'S A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MAKE/MODEL.  IT WILL REQUIRE A TECHNICIAN TAKING FRONT DASH APART AND REPLACING A WIRELESS SENSOR.    IF THIS IS SO COMMON, WHY NO WARRANTY WHEN IT'S A CLEAR SAFETY ISSUE?   55,000 MILES, 2016 MODEL.",
