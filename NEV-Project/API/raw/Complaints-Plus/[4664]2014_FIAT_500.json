The store was a Batteries plus in Los Angeles CA, the store owners were Hattian or East African , at the time it seems that I was the victim of a ubiquitous sexual harassment case, now being investigate.  There are other elements to the circumstances as the car being altered possibly in transit by Car Max from Brooklyn Park Minnesota to Memphis Tennessee possibly by Hispanic individuals as the inventory from \"Autozone\" shows that the car was made in Mexico, not that it was not, it is just that I thought that the guys telling me this were doing so trying to entrap me, so that they could tow the car, that was what they bothered me about the entire time. Then all of the males were not Hispanic, some were other ethnicities, inc. Caucasian. The crime was online",

AS WE PULLED OFF FROM STAR-BUCKS I NOTICED WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE. CALLED THE FIAT DEALERSHIP AS IT WAS HAPPENING, THEY SUGGEST ME TO BRING FIAT IN, SO I DID. FIAT VERIFIED THE PROBLEM AND STATED THIS.( VERIFIED CLUTCH BURNING TYPE SMELL UNDER HOOD. INSPECT AND FOUND NO LEAK AND NO CODES IN PCM OR TCM. DROVE AND FOUND ENGAGEMENT FROM STOP VERY SLIGHTLY DELAYED COMPARED TO NEWER VEHICLE. RELEARNED CLUTCH CONTACT POINTS. DROVE AGAIN AND FEELS BETTER. OK AT THIS TIME.)  THEN ON MAY 6 2015 14005 MILES,MY FIAT 500L DID IT AGAIN. WE WERE AT POPEYES DRIVE-THRU WAITING IN LINE TO BUY CHICKEN AND IT HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THE BURNING SMELL AND WHITE SMOKE,BUT THIS TIME MY FIAT WOULDN'T MOVE WHILE WE WERE IN DRIVE. SO I SHIFTED OUT OF DRIVE TO REVERSE FROM REVERSE TO NEUTRAL AND CAR WOULDN'T MOVE. THEN I PUT IT IN PARK AND KILL THE CAR, REATRTED CAR AND IT DECIDED TO MOVE THEN. SO IT SCARED ME AGAIN WITH THE BREATHING OF THE BURNING SMELL, IN WHICH HURTS YOUR LUNGS AND BURNS YOUR EYES. SO I BROUGHT THE FIAT TO A DIFFERENT FIAT DEALERSHIP, WITH MY CONCERN. THEY KEPT THE  CAR FOR 1 DAY AND SAID. (TEST DRIVE VEHICLE AND IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. SHIFTS THROUGH GEARS PRO PERTLY, UP SHIFTS AND DOWN SHIFTS. UNABLE TO DUPLICATE CONCERN AT THIS TIME. CHECKED OVER VEHICLE ANS IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED.",
