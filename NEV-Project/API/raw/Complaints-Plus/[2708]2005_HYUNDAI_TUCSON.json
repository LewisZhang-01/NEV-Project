('ARRESTS' IT, THEY CLAIM, BUT NOT REMOVES IT.)    BY THAT DATE I HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED TWO FAILURES CAUSED BY THE CORROSION, BOTH OF WHICH I BELIEVE HAD HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS, EVEN FATAL ACCIDENTS.      THE REPAIRS COST ALMOST $2,000, BUT THEY REFUSED TO REIMBURSE.  I AM MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SAFETY ISSUES.     LUCKILY, THE FUEL TANK FALLING ONTO THE DRIVE SHAFT DID NOT RUPTURE AND EXPLODE.    THE RIGHT FRONT CONTROL ARM FAILURE CAUSED LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL AND AN ABRUPT STOP INTO THE RIGHT CURB.  HAD IT BEEN THE LEFT FRONT,, I WOULD HAVE BEEN STEERED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  HAD IT BEEN AT TURNPIKE SPEED I SUSPECT A LIKELY ROLLOVER.  THE LEFT FRONT ARM WAS ALSO NEAR FAILURE.    I SENT TWO EMAILS TO HYUNDAI, AND MADE A NUMBER OF CALLS, IN PART REQUESTING REPAIR REIMBURSEMENT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO TELL THEM MY CONCERN THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  I ASKED THEM TO BUY IT BACK AT A FAIR PRICE. NO RESPONSE.      TWICE, THEY PROMISED TO CONTACT ME IN 2 TO 5 DAYS, THEY DIDN'T, EVER..  WHEN I LATER CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM I HAD SOLD THE CAR (AT A LOSS IN VALUE) THEY JUST BRUSHED ME OFF.  (TO PARAPHRASE THEM: 'IT'S NO LONGER AN ISSUE SINCE YOU NOW DON'T OWN IT').      I CAN PROVIDE DOCUMENTS (REPAIR INVOICES, WITH FINDINGS, AND EMAILS IF YOU WISH).    I AM REQUESTING YOU TAKE ACTION TO INVESTIGATE, AND AS NEEDED, TAKE ACTION TO ISSUE STRONGER SANCTIONS AGAINST HYUNDAI,  THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL ALL THE AFFECTED CARS.",

GOT A CARD IN THE MAIL FOR A FREE 34 POINT INSPECTION FROM THE DEALERSHIP, AND DECIDED ON APRIL 5, 2007 TO USE IT.   DURING INSPECTION NOTHING WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.  THEN THIS WEEK ON  MAY 8, 2007 THE CHECK ENGINE\"LIGHT CAME ON.  TOOK VEHICLE BACK TO DEALER FOR CHECK.  I WAS ADVISED THAT SOME VALVE WAS BAD AND THEY REPLACED IT, BUT  BY THE WAY, YOU NEED 4 NEW TIRES AND AN ALIGNMENT RIGHT AWAY. RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING IN THE RAIN I HAD NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, HYDROPLANING.  I FELT VERY UNSAFE AND GLANCED AT MY TIRES.  STRANGE ENOUGH, ALL 4 TIRES WERE EVENLY WORN OUT  AND NEAR COMPLETELY BALD.  DID I MENTION THAT I ONLY HAD 27,000 MILES ON THEM ,AND I HAVE  NOT BEEN ANYWHERE BUT REGULAR STREETS.   BUT NOT BEING THE TIRE EXPERT I TOOK THE DEALERSHIP AT THEIR WORD AND ASSUMED ALL WAS WELL.  SO, A BIT ANNOYED ON MAY 8,2007  I DECIDED TO LOOK UP MY WARRANTY PAPERWORK.  HOW IRONIC!  THERE WERE TWO PAMPHLETS FOR TIRES IN MY LITTLE HANDY LITTLE HYUNDAI OWNER'S PACK.  ONE FOR THESE GREAT 60,000 MILE GOOD YEAR TIRES,,  AND THEN THE OTHER FOR THE HANKOOK, KUMHO TIRES THAT JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE ONLY A 24,000 MILE WARRANTY, AND HAPPENED TO BE THE ONES THAT HAD APPARENTLY BEEN PUT ON MY CAR.  SO, NOT ONLY LOSING A CUSTOMER TO A SNEAKY BAIT AND SWITCH TACTIC DURING THE SALE OF THE LX MODEL TUCSON, THE DEALERSHIP AND THE TIRE MAKER PUT MY SAFETY AT RISK AND TRIED TO BLAME IT ON A POOR ALIGNMENT.  I MAY BE A WOMAN, AND ONE THAT DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CARS, BUT I DID KNOW THAT IF A VEHICLE WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT ALL FOURS TIRES  WEREN'T WORN EVENLY AND COMPLETELY BALD AFTER AN INSPECTION THAT TOOK PLACE JUST A MONTH PRIOR, YET WASN'T MENTIONED .    I WAS  STILL PLEASED WITH TUSCON, BUT VERY ANGRY WITH DEALERSHIP TACTICS.  *AK",

THE LIGHT WOULD FLICKER ON AND OFF WITH AN ADULT FEMALE OF OVER FIVE FEET IN HEIGHT AND OVER 100 LBS, BUT LESS THAN 115LBS.  ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS MANUAL THE FLICKERING LIGHT MEANS THAT THE SENSOR FOR THE AIRBAG IS MALFUNCTIONING.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD CHECKED IT AND IT WAS WORKING FINE.  THEY SAID IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTED THAT THEY COULD ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SENSOR.  THE PROBLEM CONTINUED TO OCCUR AND I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DIFFERENT HYUNDAI DEALER A COUPLE OF TOWNS AWAY.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE SENSOR WAS OPERATING CORRECTLY AND TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY.  THE PROBLEM AGAIN PERSISTED AND THE SECOND HYUNDAI, UPON A THIRD VISIT, SAID THAT THERE IS NO WEIGHT LIMIT FOR THE SENSOR TO WORK AT, BUT LIKE THE MANUAL STATES, THE PERSON NEEDS TO SIT CORRECTLY IN THE SEAT.  THEY TOOK A LOOK AT THE SENSOR AND SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN LESS ISSUES IN REGARDS TO THE AIRBAG LIGHT.  HOWEVER, THE LIGHT STILL COMES ON OCCASIONALLY FOR THIS PASSENGER AND THE SIZE, SHAPE, AND WAY OF SITTING IN THE SEAT HAS NOT CHANGED.  *JB",

THE CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT WORK.  ). I DROVE THAT CAR TO LA. ON HWY 5 WITH THE SAME SPEED AS 80 MPH. AS THE OTHERS. WHEN I DROVE UP TO THE HILLS, THE SPEEDING WAS DROPPED TO 60 MPH. (20 MPH.DIFFERENCE) AND COULDN'T SPEED UP UNTIL DOWN FROM THE HILLS. I'VE TRIED TO CHANGE TO LOWER GEAR ... IT WAS STILL STRUGGLED. I GOT HONK AND ALMOST GOT HIT FROM THE CARS BEHIND.  EVERYONE (SALES, FINANCIAL, SERVICE DEPARTMENT) WHOM CONCERN THIS CASE TOLD ME THAT THEY WILL FIX EVERYTHING FOR US.  ON 4/22/05 `JAYSON` CALLED ME TO PICK UP THAT CAR. HE TOLD ME THAT `THERE WERE 2 TECHNICIANS CHECKED MY CAR AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG, CRUISE CONTROL WORKS, THIS CAR IS A NORMAL AS 2.0 GL AND ONLY 4 CYLINDERS.  FOR THE FIRST PROBLEM. I TRIED TO DRIVE AND CHECK IT WITH IT. FINALLY, HE FOUND OUT THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL'S CHIP WAS LOOSEN AND FIXED IT.  WHAT DID HIS 2 TECHNICIANS CHECK?  FOR THE SECOND PROBLEM. HE SAID IT'S A NORMAL CAR, HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING... JUST THE WAY THAT CAR IS. BUT FOR ME, IT UNSAFE TO DRIVE EVEN THE HILLS IN THE CITY (I USUALLY GO TO SAN FRANCISCO, AND TRAVEL AROUND ESPECIALLY LAKE TAHOE, YOSEMITE).  THIS CAR IS AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION !!!  E SUGGESTED ME TO CHANGE TO LOWER GEAR. I'VE DONE BUT IT NEVER WORKED !!  THESE WORDS `WE'LL HELP YOU`. RESULT; THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE DONE.
