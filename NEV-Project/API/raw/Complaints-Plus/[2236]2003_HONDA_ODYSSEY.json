SHE HAD IT FLOORED TO PASS A SLOW MOVING VEHICLE ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY WHEN THE ISSUE OCCURRED.  I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE WITH THE VAN OFF AND IN THE GARAGE, IF I PUSHED THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN, IT HAD PLENTY OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE PEDAL AND THE FLOOR MAT.  HOWEVER, ON FURTHER INSPECTION, I NOTICED THAT IF YOU PUSHED DOWN ON THE MAT APPROXIMATELY WHERE YOUR HEAL WOULD BE, IT PUSHED THE MAT DOWN INTO A DEPRESSION IN THE FLOORBOARD AND CAUSED THE FRONT LIP OF THE MAT TO RAISE UP. WHEN THE LIP OF THE MAT WAS RAISED UP, IT WOULD CATCH THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND CAUSE IT TO STICK.  TO REMEDY THE ISSUE WE CUT A BIG PIECE OUT OF THE FRONT LIP OF THE MAT AND THEN VERIFIED IT HAD PROPER CLEARANCE EVEN WHEN PUSHING THE MAT DOWN INTO THE DEPRESSION IN THE FLOORBOARD.  WE'VE HAD THESE MATS OVER TEN YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US.  I HOPE REPORTING THIS WILL ENABLE A RECALL OR SOMETHING TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM GETTING KILLED OR INJURED.  I REALIZE THIS IS AN AFTERMARKET VEHICLE PRODUCT BUT HOPE YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO HELP.  I FIGURED OUT THE SOURCE OF THE ISSUE BY RESEARCHING AND DISCOVERING THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS AS WELL.

IN THAT RECALL, HONDA STATED THAT CERTAIN OPERATING CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN HEAT BUILD-UP BETWEEN THE COUNTER SHAFT AND SECONDARY SHAFT SECOND GEARS. THAT COULD LEAD TO GEAR TOOTH CHIPPING OR, IN VERY RARE CASES, GEAR BREAKAGE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TRANSMISSION COULD LOCK UP, INCREASING THE CHANCE OF A CRASH. INSTEAD OF REPLACE THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED ON MY ODYSSEY, A HONDA DEALER INSTALLED A LINE JET KIT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LUBRICATION TO THE GEARS. IN JUNE 2014, MY VAN STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF TRANSMISSION FAILURE AT 93,128 MILES. THE SECOND GEAR IS VERY HARD TO SHIFT AND SLIPPED EVEN LOCKED FROM TIME TO TIME. IN TWO OF THE CASES, A REAR COLLISION ALMOST OCCURRED WITHOUT WARNING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY. AFTER I CONSULTED TWO HONDA DEALERSHIPS AND WAS TOLD A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT IS NEEDED. I PAID $3,000 TO REPLACE THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION OUT OF MY OWN POCKET. HONDA DENIED THE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT ONLY OFFERED 25% FOR THE TOTAL REPLACEMENT COST OF NEARLY $6,000.

I HAD READ THAT 2003 HONDA ODYSSEYS MAY CONTAIN TAKADA AIR BAG INFLATORS MANUFACTURED WITH INADEQUATE MANUFACTURING CONTROL.  THE CURRENT RECALL (AS STATED ON THEIR WEB SITE) IS LIMITED TO 13 U.S. STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT \"CONSISTENTLY EXPERIENCE HIGH ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY\".  THE LIST DOES NOT INCLUDE INDIANA.  THE HONDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT AIRBAG INFLATOR WAS INSTALLED IN MY VAN EVEN WITH THE VIN.  THE REPRESENTATIVE SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT A DEALER.  I THEN CONTACTED A DEALER IN CLARKSVILLE INDIANA AND ASKED IF THEY COULD TELL ME WHAT AIRBAG INFLATOR WAS INSTALLED IN MY VEHICLE BASED UPON THE VIN.   THE DEALER SAID NO. HONDA & THE DEALER BOTH CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS INADEQUATE PART TRACEABILITY IN THEIR VEHICLES.  WITHOUT SUCH TRACEABILITY TO THE VIN, NO RECALL THAT IS CONDUCTED COULD ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE DEFECTIVE PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. LETTING THE MANUFACTURER DETERMINE HOW A RECALL IS CONDUCTED IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC.   MANUFACTURER NEGOTIATION AND BARGAINING WITH NHTSA CONCERNING RECALLS IS ALSO AN INADEQUATE PROCESS.  IT LACKS TRANSPARENCY THAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES IN MATTERS THAT ARE RELATED TO LIFE AND DEATH SAFETY ISSUES.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD ALREADY CONDUCTED AIR BAG RECALL WORK ON MANY HONDA ODYSSEY VANS IN INDIANA (10 - 20). THIS CONTRADICTS THE SCOPE OF THE CURRENT RECALL LISTED ON HONDA'S WEB SITE AND CALLS INTO QUESTION THE HONESTY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE DEALER OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE.  WHEN A MANUFACTURING SAFETY RELATED DEFECT AS SERIOUS AS THE HONDA ISSUE ARISES, THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO HAVE THEIR INTERESTS PLACED AHEAD OF THE PROFITS OF ANY MANUFACTURER OR DEALER. THE CONFUSION AROUND THIS ISSUE AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ALSO CASTS A SHADOW UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENTIRE REGULATORY SYSTEM.  *TR",

UPON LEARNING OF THE OPEN RECALL, AND THE SEVERITY OF THE POTENTIAL ISSUE, I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE DEALER FOR MAINTENANCE.  ON 2014-07-18, THE DEALER CONFIRMED THE RECALL HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED, THEN INFORMED ME THEY ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THE RECALL.  I OPENED A CASE WITH HONDA AMERICA, WHO OVER THE COURSE OF 4 WEEKS, FIRST INDICATED THAT THE ISSUE I DESCRIBED (SINCE OWNING THE VEHICLE, SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR WOULD \"STUTTER\") WAS NOT RELATED, THEREFORE THE RECALL WOULD NOT BE PERFORMED.  I REPLIED THE RECALL IS NOT CONDITIONAL TO THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE, AND MUST BE PERFORMED.  HONDA AMERICA THEN REPLIED THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN REPLACED, AND WAS NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL.  AFTER MORE THAN A WEEK, THE DEALER AGREED TO PROVIDE THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE TRANSMISSION, CONFIRMING IT WAS THE ORIGINAL HONDA PART.  MOST RECENTLY, HONDA AMERICA CLAIMS THAT AN INSPECTION PORT ON THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN ALTERED, AND THEREFORE THE RECALL IS NOT APPLICABLE.  I HAVE 11 YEARS OF RECORDS WITH THE DEALER (EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF MAINTENANCE TO THE VEHICLE), AND NONE INDICATE RECALL OR MODIFICATION PERFORMED.  *TR",

WE CONTACTED HONDA BEFORE WE BOUGHT OUR MINIVAN WITH THE VIN NUMBER, TO VERIFY THAT THE VAN HAD THE RECALL WORK DONE.  IT DID....  WE PURCHASED THE VAN AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT FOR THE PAST 19 MONTHS.  WE BOUGHT THE VAN WITH 60,000 MILES ON IT.  WELL THIS PAST THURSDAY THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO SLIP JUST A LITTLE AND IT DID IT AGAIN ON FRIDAY.  LONG STORY SHORT, BY MONDAY OUR TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY WENT OUT.  WE TOOK IT TO A HONDA DEALER TO CONFIRM AND THEY ASSURED US THAT WE NEEDED TO REPLACE OUR TRANSMISSION.  OUR VAN NOW HAS 75,000 MILES ON IT AND A BAD TRANSMISSION.  WE CONTACTED HONDA ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY OFFERED NO EXPLANATION OR ASSISTANCE.  THEY PRETTY MUCH TOLD US THAT WE WERE OUT OF LUCK.  WE ARE PRETTY UPSET THAT WE CONTACTED THEM BEFORE WE PURCHASED THIS VAN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION AND LESS THAN 2 YRS (AND ONLY 15,000 MILES) LATER WE ARE PAYING $3700 TO HAVE A NEW ONE INSTALLED.  FROM WHAT WE HAVE READ ONLINE, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR OF HONDA ODYSSEY AND WE FEEL HONDA SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS ISSUE!!  THANK YOU!  *TR",

THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT OR BEHIND US AND I WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED AT THE RED LIGHT.    THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYED FIRST WITH A LOUD \"POP\". TWO TO THREE SECONDS LATER THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYED (WHERE MY WIFE WAS SITTING). FORTUNATELY, BOTH OF US WERE SITTING BACK IN OUR SEATS AND I HAD MY HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL. NEITHER OF US WERE CONTACTED BY THE AIRBAGS THERE WAS A THIRD LOUD \"POP\" A COUPLE OF SECONDS AFTER THE DEPLOYMENTS. THE SEATBELT TENSIONERS ALSO ENGAGED AND NOW DO NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.    I IMMEDIATELY PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CONFIRMED THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN STRUCK BY ANYONE OR ANYTHING. I BROUGHT THE VAN INTO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR AN INSPECTION, WHERE WE HAD PURCHASED IT A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS EARLIER. THE INSPECTION REPORT STATES THAT, \"DURING SERVICE INSPECTION DID NOT LOCATE ANY OBVIOUS IMPACTS AND/OR DAMAGE.\" THE DEALERSHIP PULLED CODES 53-41 AND 54-50, BUT SAID THEY COULD NOT GET ANYMORE INFORMATION FROM THE SRS UNIT UNTIL WE HAD THEM REPLACE THE AIRBAGS. THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THEN GAVE US A QUOTE OF OVER $4100 TO FIX THE AIRBAGS AND SEATBELTS.     I CONTACTED HONDA OF AMERICA AND ASKED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER. IT TOOK ALMOST A MONTH TO GET A CORPORATE HONDA REPRESENTATIVE TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP AS THE FIRST INSPECTION. LAST NIGHT I RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND INSPECTION, WHICH GAVE NO POTENTIAL REASONS FOR THE DEPLOYMENT. WE LEFT THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP, ASKING FOR MORE SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION ON POTENTIAL CAUSES.

I ALSO NOTICED A BURNING SMELL. ABOUT TWO MINUTES LATER, WHILE STILL TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE LOST ALL ACCELERATION. SO WE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER WE PULLED OVER, THE VEHICLE CEASED ALL OPERATIONS.  MY INITIAL EFFORTS TO RESTART THE VEHICLE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT AFTER 5 MINUTES, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE.  AGAIN, THE VEHICLE CEASED OPERATIONS AFTER A FEW MINUTES. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE VEHICLE, WE DECIDED TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  WHILE SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK, WE TURNED ON THE VEHICLE AGAIN TO OPERATE THE AIR CONDITIONING.  AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES, WE NOTICED THE BURNING SMELL AND PUFFS OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN.  WE TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND WAITED FOR THE TOW TRUCK.  THE HONDA DEALERSHIP TO WHICH THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH AND FIXED THE PROBLEM. THEY INFORMED ME THE IGNITION SWITCH \"BURNED UP\" INSIDE.

JULY 20, 2011 VAN IS AGAIN PACKED WITH ENTIRE FAMILY TO TRAVEL TO NC VACATION. 30 MINUTES OUTSIDE OF OUR HOMETOWN, LOUISVILLE, KY IT HAPPENED AGAIN! 13 MONTHS AFTER LAST REPAIR.

IT WAS A BIT SCARY, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO COAST ACROSS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC AND INTO A PARKING LOT. THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN DRIVE, DRIVE3, OR REVERSE. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO DRIVE SLOWLY IN A VERY LOW GEAR. I DROVE IT  ABOUT A MILE TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC. HE CHECKED THE CODES AND GOT P0730 (INCORRECT GEAR RATIO), AND P0740 (TORQUE CONVERTER MALFUNCTION). AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH AND CONSULTING WITH HIS TRANSMISSION EXPERT, HE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.     I AM THE SECOND OWNER OF THIS ODYSSEY. BOUGHT IT FROM A FRIEND IN APRIL OF 2012. I HAVE ALL OF THEIR DEALERSHIP  SERVICE RECORDS. ACCORDING TO THOSE RECORDS, THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT 7500 MILES IN JUNE OF 2004. AS SUCH, THAT MEANS THERE ARE LESS THAN 97,000 MILES ON THE TRANSMISSION. THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN GENTLY IN THE CITY AND ON THE HIGHWAY. IT HAS NEVER TOWED ANYTHING.     I TALKED TO AMERICAN HONDA TODAY AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP BECAUSE I AM THE SECOND OWNER. HOWEVER, WHEN PRESSED, THE AGENT DID ADMIT THAT THEY DO HELP SOME SECOND, THIRD... FOURTH OWNERS, BUT IT IS CASE BY CASE. IN MY CASE THE ANSWER WAS \"NO\". I ASKED WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT IN MY CASE FOR THEM TO HELP ME AND SHE SIMPLY SAID IT WAS CASE BY CASE. BASICALLY WE WENT IN CIRCLES FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES.THE CONVERSATION WAS POLITE, BUT FRUSTRATING. I THEN ASKED IF I COULD SPECK TO A SUPERVISOR.    THE SUPERVISOR SUGGESTED I TALK WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND SEE IF THEY WOULD MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FOR ASSISTANCE TO AMERICAN HONDA.  *TR",

AS I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO MOVE A BIT, THE CAR DID NOT WANT TO MOVE, AND THEN IT HESITANTLY MOVED FORWARD A BIT, I STOPPED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC. WHILE SITTING, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO HUM AND WHEN I NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN, THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. I TRIED TAKING IT OUT OF DRIVE AND THEN PUTTING IT BACK IN DRIVE, BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. BECAUSE OF ANOTHER INCIDENT, I HAD IT TOWED TO A SHOP FOR SOME BODYWORK TO BE DONE; AFTER PICKING IT FROM THE REPAIR SHOP, I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT WHEN THE SAME PROBLEM OF HESITATION STARTED AGAIN.    AFTER RETURNING FROM MY TRIP, I CALLED THE HONDA DEALER WHERE THE CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN SERVICED AND TOLD THEM I WAS BRINGING IT IN. I HAD TO PULL OVER SEVERAL TIMES WHILE DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD STALL; AFTER PULLING OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND WAITING A FEW MINUTES FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO WORK AGAIN; I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.    AFTER THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CHECKED THE CAR OUT, I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD NEED A RE-MANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION; COST FOR THIS WAS $4,458.00 WHICH SEEMED PRETTY HIGH.   THE SERVICE REP SAID HONDA DOES NOT REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION ON YOUR CAR BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO THE PARTS, SO THEY RECOMMEND A RE-MANUFACTURED ONE WHICH COMES WITH A 36,000 MILE WARRANTY OR 3 YRS.

THE OIL THEY SAID, WAS COMING FROM THE REAR HEAD BOLT THAT HAD DEVELOPED A LEAK. AS IT TURNED OUT, THE BOLT WAS STRIPPED.     THIS VEHICLE WAS NEVER USED FOR TOWING. IT WAS A \"CARPOOL THE KIDS TO SCHOOL AND A TWO SPRING BREAKS TO FLORIDA VACATIONS\" VAN. AT 113,000 MILES, THIS IS DISAPPOINTING. ESPECIALLY SINCE WE BOUGHT ANOTHER HONDA IN 2005 AND NOW WE ARE AFRAID OF FAILURE THERE AS WELL.    THE HEAD BOLT REPAIR NECESSITATES A NEW ENGINE AND THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR WAS MADE AT A PRIVATE SHOP.  I SPOKE WITH HONDA MOTORS AMERICA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY OFFERED NO INDICATION OF HELP OR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. I HAVE YET TO REPAIR THE ENGINE.  *TR",

APPARENTLY HEAD BOLTS HAD BECOME LOOSE GIVEN THE THREAD FAILURE IN THE BLOCK AND ALLOWED LEAKAGE OF FLUIDS IN THE CYLINDER HEAD.  HONDA STATED THAT THE ENGINE WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF 3K++.   APPARENTLY THIS SAME ISSUE HAS OCCURRED TO SEVERAL OTHER 2003 ODYSSEY OWNERS ACCORDING TO ON-LINE SEARCH.  THE DEALER WAS AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THE FAILURE OF THE BOLTS AT THE GIVEN MILEAGE. IT APPEARS THAT THIS COULD BE A DEFECT IN THE BLOCK DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE AND COULD LEAD TO PREMATURE ENGINE FAILURE.  HONDA SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AND EGR VALVE DEFECTS WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN A CONTINUAL PROBLEM WITH THE 2003 ODYSSEY.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RELIABILITY OF THIS VAN  *TR",

SO I CALLED AND TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC JUST BEFORE THEY CLOSED. HE QUICKLY CHECKED IT AND SAID IT PROBABLY JUST NEEDED A TRANSMISSION SERVICE. SO MY BOYFRIEND AND I TOWED IT TO CASPER, WYOMING AND TOOK IT TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THERE. THEY CHECKED IT AND IT CAME UP WITH 3 MALFUNCTION CODES P0710N/P0780/P1750. SO IT NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION. THE MILEAGE IS AT 148417 AND I HAVE ONLY OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW. IT HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS INDICATION THAT IT HAD ANY PROBLEMS. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ME BETWEEN $3200-$4500 TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION PUT IN MY CAR.

MUCH TO MY DISMAY, I RECEIVED A CALL SAYING THAT THE FRONT AND SIDE ENGINE MOUNTS WERE BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $516.81.  I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ENGINE MOUNTS GOING BAD ON A VEHICLE AND NEEDING TO BE REPLACED.  WE BOUGHT A HONDA ODYSSEY TO HAVE AS A RELIABLE FAMILY VAN THAT WE PLANNED TO KEEP FOR A WHILE.  ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE BOUGHT A HONDA IS BECAUSE OF THE NOTED REPUTATION FOR BEING A SAFE AND RELIABLE AUTO BRAND.     THE DEALER STATED THAT THE MOTOR MOUNT REPLACEMENT SHOULD CORRECT ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE REPORTED WITH THE VAN.  THE TRANSMISSION REGULARLY MAKES A TERRIBLE CLUNKING NOISE WHEN IT IS SHIFTED FROM PARK TO REVERSE.  WE ALSO REPORTED THIS SAME CLUNKING AND SOME SLIPPING IN THE TRANSMISSION WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM.  THESE PROBLEMS HAVE NEVER GONE AWAY AND WE HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE TRANSMISSION IN OUR ODYSSEY.  FORTUNATELY IT HAS NOT LEFT US STRANDED ON THE ROADSIDE AND STUCK WITH A HUGE REPAIR BILL YET.      OUR CONCERNS SEEM TO BE VALIDATED BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE READ ON VARIOUS WEB SITES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS AND FAILURES OF THE ODYSSEY'S TRANSMISSION.  WE WENT AHEAD AND SPENT THE MONEY TO HAVE THE ENGINE MOUNTS REPLACED.  HOWEVER, THIS HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH THE 'CLUNKING' NOISE WHEN SHIFTING THE VEHICLE FROM PARK TO REVERSE.     I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE COULD DRIVE THIS VAN FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME AND ACCUMULATE WELL OVER 100,000 MILES BASED ON THE PURPORTED RELIABILITY OF THE HONDA BRAND.

THE PRICE QUOTED TO ME FOR A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION AND CONTROL MODULE WAS ABOUT $5000, NOT WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR OR WAS EXPECTING. I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN LAST JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND ANY REGULAR MAINTENANCE NEEDED, EXPECTING ANY ABNORMALITIES WOULD BE NOTED. I WOULD HAVE BEEN DUE FOR ANOTHER OIL CHANGE ABOUT NOW, BUT I JUST RECENTLY CHANGED THE OIL AND OIL FILTER MYSELF, LESS THAN 3000 MILES AGO. HOW IS IT THAT A SUPPOSEDLY RELIABLE VEHICLE CAN, WITHOUT WARNING, GO FROM 100% FUNCTIONING TO NEEDING A MAJOR DRIVE COMPONENT REPLACEMENT? I JUST CALLED HONDA CORPORATE FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS, AS A MAJOR EQUIPMENT FAILURE OF THIS NATURE SHOULDN'T BE DROPPED ON THE CONSUMER, AND I HAVE READ MANY SIMILAR ISSUES WITH THIS MODEL YEAR TRANSMISSION. I'D BE HAPPY PAYING 25-50% OF THE COSTS, WITH A MINIMUM 36K MI/ 3 YR WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION. THIS WOULD ONLY BE THE SECOND MAJOR EXPENSE I'VE HAD TO PAY ON THE VAN, AS THE FIRST ONE WAS THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED TIMING BELT REPLACEMENT, WHICH WAS DONE WELL BEFORE THE TYPICAL MILEAGE MARK. *TR",

WE DROVE FOR 30 MILES WHEN THERE WAS A SMELL LIKE GAS AND IT GOT STRONGER IN COUPLE OF MINUTES. I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO PULL OVER AND STOP THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE DID NOT MOVE AFTER THAT.

A FEW MINUTES LATER-THE TCS LIGHT ON THE DASH CAME ON! ALL OF A SUDDEN THE THING STARTED JERKING LIKE A BULL AND THE RPM'S REVVED UP AND WE LOST POWER & IT KEPT JERKING -SCARED US TO DEATH!!  WE WERE ON THE HIGHWAY WITH THE CRUISE ON. WE BOUGHT THIS 2003 HONDA FROM A DEALER WITH 10 MILES ON IT AND IT'S ONLY GOT 91,000 NOW!  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED. THE WHOLE REASON WE PAID $30,000 FOR A VAN WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A HONDA! ANYWAY, WE GOT OFF THE NEXT EXIT TO A TRUCK STOP TO GET SOME TRANSMISSION FLUID BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY. THE ENGINE WAS ALL WET UNDER THE HOOD AND THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS LOW BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE TO TURN AROUND, CANCEL OUR KINGS ISLAND FUN DAY, AND HEAD HOME (HOPING AND PRAYING THAT WE WOULD MAKE IT)!  WE GOT BACK ON THE HIGHWAY AND I CALLED OUR HONDA DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND EXPLAINED TO A TECH. WHAT HAPPENED AND HE BASICALLY SAID TO PULL OVER - CALL A TOW TRUCK AND BRING IT IN SO THEY COULD LOOK AT IT! THAT'S IT!  THAT'S ALL HE SAID! NO - LET ME CALL A TOW TRUCK FOR YOU AND BRING YOU A RENTAL-NOTHING!  WE COULDN'T DO THAT-6 OF US CAN'T FIT IN A TOW TRUCK! ANYWAY, WE STARTED TO HEAD BACK ONLY DOING ABOUT 50 CUZ OF THE RPM'S-WE HAD THE FLASHERS ON AND MADE IT DOWN THE ROAD TO THE NEXT EXIT AND MY HUSBAND BOUGHT SOME TRANSMISSION FLUID. WE THEN EVER SO CAREFULLY MADE IT BACK HOME WHERE IT NOW SITS IN OUR DRIVEWAY-I AM VERY SAD CUZ IT WAS MY BABY AND NOW WE HAVE A MAJOR DILEMMA. WE HAD DECIDED TO TRADE IT IN ON ANOTHER VEHICLE YESTERDAY (BEFORE ANY OF THIS HAPPENED!) BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT EVERYTHING DONE-THE BANKS WERE CLOSED. OUR SALESMAN KNEW ABOUT KINGS ISLAND AND IS AWAITING US TO COME BACK OUT TO TRADE. NOW WHAT? THIS WILL COST US THOUSANDS ON OUR TRADE - IF THEY STILL TAKE IT! OH-I FORGOT TO MENTION THE \"D\" FOR DRIVE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND WE LOST OUR REVERSE GEAR TOO!! HELP!!! *TR",

I WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALER THAT THERE WAS A TRANSMISSION RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE IN 2004, I DO NOT RECALL TAKING THE VEHICLE IN FOR INSPECTION/REPAIR.  THE HONDA SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE HONDA RECORDS SHOWED THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED; THERE IS NO PAPERWORK WITH MY SIGNATURE INDICATING MY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH RECALL ORDER.  IF THE TRANSMISSION INSPECTION DID, IN FACT, TAKE PLACE, APPARENTLY IT DID NOT THOROUGHLY EVALUATE MY VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION SITUATION.     IN THE PAST THE HONDA DEALERSHIP HAS PERFORMED TWO TRANSMISSION OIL CHANGES, WITHIN A SHORT TIME, BECAUSE THE OIL WAS TURNING BROWN.  I USED A DIFFERENT MECHANIC TO DO MY ROUTINE MOTOR OIL CHANGES AND THAT MECHANIC INFORMED ME THE TRANSMISSION OIL WAS BROWN AGAIN AND REPLACED IT, AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION OIL.   I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OIL CHANGE PROCEDURE BETWEEN AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC AND THE HONDA DEALERSHIP.  I WAS INFORMED TODAY BY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT THEY CHANGED THEIR TRANSMISSION OIL EQUIPMENT WITH UPDATED TECHNOLOGY.      TODAY, UNDER PROTEST, I AUTHORIZED HONDA DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN THE SUBJECT VAN.  IT WAS NOT FEASIBLE FOR ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER MECHANIC.

I SAID NO WHEN HE GAVE ME COST OF $4000 BECAUSE I DECIDED TO SELL THE CAR AND BUY A NEW ONE. I TOLD HIM TO ORDER THE PART WHEN HE CALLED ME LATER ON BECAUSE HE COULD FIX THE PROBLEMS AT $2100. DEALER HAD TRANSMISSION CHANGED ON 3/8/10 , AND THE NEXT DAY (3/9/10) THE SAME CHECK-ENGINE-LIGHT CAME ON WITHIN 24 HOURS. I DROVE BACK TO THE DEALER. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THE REP GUY TOLD ME THAT ANYTHING COULD CAUSE THE LIGHT ON, AND THE TECHNICIAN GAVE A DIFFERENT CODE. I WAS THEN TOLD IT WAS NOT CHEAP TO FIX IT. I QUESTIONED WHY THEY DID NOT GIVE ME ALL THE PROBLEM CODES AND COSTS IN THE BEGINNING. I WOULD HAVE MADE DECISION TO TRADE IN INSTEAD OF SPENDING $2200, AND THEN BEING TOLD MORE SPENDING TO COME. I WENT IN FOR THE CHECK-ENGINE-LIGHT ON AND I CAME BACK FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITHIN 24 HOURS. WHY WOULDN'T I SELL IT BEFORE I PUT IN $2200? THE SERVICE REP GUY HAD SUCH A BAD ATTITUDE BY KICKING OUT PROBLEMS AND PUSHING AWAY RESPONSIBILITIES. HE SAID DEALER DID NOT MANUFACTURE THE CAR AND INSISTED SAYING MY CAR WAS 10 YEARS OLD. THE SERVICE MANAGER, REQUESTED THE TECHNICIAN TO RESET THE LIGHT, AND SAID HOPEFULLY IT WOULD NOT COME BACK ON AGAIN. I'M AWARE IF A PROBLEM EXISTS, LIGHT WILL COME BACK ON SOONER OR LATER. AND INSPECTION WON'T GO THROUGH WHEN SUCH A LIGHT IS ON. AS PREDICTED, SAME CHECK-ENGINE-LIGHT CAME BACK ON THE 3/10/10 WITHIN 48 HOURS. AND I CALLED THE MANAGER, HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO COST ANOTHER $875 PLUS TAX. I DIDN'T EXPECT A TRANSMISSION'S PROBLEM BEFORE 100K MILES FOR A JAPANESE CAR. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. *TR",

DRIVING THE CAR DURING THE 3 DAYS AFTER FAILURE WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WITH THE CLUTCH INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING CAUSING HIGH REVVING AND LACK OF CONTROL. SLOWING DOWN (RESULTING IN DOWNSHIFTING) CAUSES THE CAR TO \"JERK\" SINCE THE CLUTCH ISN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AND THE CAR ISN'T ABLE TO SMOOTHLY CHANGE GEARS.    HONDA ISSUED A RECALL IN 2004 TO ADD AN \"OIL JET\" INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION ON THE 2ND GEAR TO PREVENT OVERHEATING, BUT THIS FIX HASN'T FIXED THEIR DESIGN FLAW. DESPITE HAVING THIS RECALL TAKEN CARE OF BY THE DEALERSHIP IN 2004, THE TRANSMISSION HAS STILL FAILED.    HONDA APPARENTLY ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION, BUT I NEVER RECEIVED NOTICE OF THIS EXTENSION AND THE DEALERSHIP HAD NO DETAILS ON THIS WARRANTY EXTENSION (OTHER THAN TO TELL ME I AM BEYOND THAT EXTENSION DUE TO TIME LAPSE).    HONDA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS DESIGN FLAW.

CONTACTED HONDA IN REGARDS TO THE RECALL AND THEY SAID THE SECOND GEAR WAS REPLACED WHEN THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD IT.  HOWEVER, CONTACTED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER WHO'S SERVICE MANAGER INDICATED THAT NO REPAIRS WERE EVER DONE ON THE VEHICLE (WHICH THE CAR FAX INDICATED THE SAME THING)  THE VAN HAS NOW SAT IN THE DRIVEWAY FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS AND I AM PAYING $357/MONTH ON THE LOAN AND FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE.  NO ONE SEEMS TO WANT TO HONOR THE RECALL.  WHEN I ASKED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER FOR THE NUMBER OF THE DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER, HE REFUSED AND WHEN I CALLED BACK AND ASKED ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL IF THEY COULD GIVE ME THE NUMBER, HER RESPONSE WAS \"WHAT DO YOU NEED THAT FOR?  IT'S POINTLESS TO CALL BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO LEAD YOU BACK TO US!\" I WASN'T EXPECTING THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO BE ON THE DEFENSE BUT APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CALL.  MY GRANDFATHER OWNS THE SAME VEHICLE I HAVE AND HAD HIS TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE RECALL. MY QUESTION IS:  WHY AM I NOT HAVING THE RECALLED HONORED FOR MY VEHICLE?  THE RECALL CLEARLY STATES THAT THE GEAR FAILURE COULD RESULT IN TRANSMISSION LOCKUP, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH.  NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY WITH MY FIVE CHILDREN IN THE CAR!  PLEASE ADVISE ME ON WHAT I CAN DO TO GET THE BALL ROLLING AND GET THIS ISSUE CLEARED UP AND MY VAN BACK ON THE ROAD.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. *TR",

THE TIRES HAD ONLY BEEN ROTATED TWICE AND BOTH TIMES WERE SECURED USING FACTORY TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS, SO INCORRECT LUG NUT SETTINGS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.  NO EVIDENCE OF GLAZING FROM RIDING THE BRAKES WAS PRESENT, NOR HAS THE CAR EVER BEEN DRIVEN WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE DEPLOYED.

THEY IMMEDIATELY SAID IT WAS THE MIDDLE SEAT AND THAT I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG BECAUSE THEY GET THE COMPLAINT ALL THE TIME. I DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ACCIDENTALLY STOPPED OFF AT THE VOLVO DEALERSHIP NEXT DOOR. THE VOLVO SERVICE GUY TRY TO SEE IF HER COULD FIX & AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS SAID THE SEAT WAS DEFECTIVE.  I THEN IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP.  ONCE SERVICE PERSON TRIED TO LATCH THE SEAT, COULD NOT, AND THEN CALLED ANOTHER SERVICE GUY WHO INITIALLY COULD NOT GET THE SEAT TO LATCH.  HE THEN PLACED A PEN AROUND THE LATCHING MECHANISM AND PULLED ON THE RELEASE LEVER A FEW TIMES AND IT RESULTED IN THE SEAT LATCHING.

ONCE AGAIN, I PICKED UP THE CAR THE SAME DAY AFTER THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS FIXED. THE VERY NEXT DAY, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN WHERE THE CAR CONTINUED TO STALL IN THE SAME SITUATIONS. I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD TO BRING IT BACK, WHICH I DID ON OCTOBER 25, 2003. YET AGAIN THEY HAD ME PICK UP THE CAR TELLING ME IT WAS FIXED. ABOUT A MONTH LATER, THE STALLING STARTED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME A LOT MORE OFTEN. I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER ON DECEMBER 15, 2003 AND IT HAS BEEN THERE SINCE THEN - FOR 3 1/2 WEEKS. I HAD CALLED HONDA OF AMERICA TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. THEIR ANSWER IS THAT THE DEALER CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE CAR STALLED MANY TIMES WHEN I DROVE IT.     I FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PICKING UP MY CAR AS IT IS RIGHT NOW, AS NOTHING WAS DONE ON IT BY THE DEALER.

AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE JUST 6 WEEKS THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:  1.  BRAKES BEGAN TO GET SOFTER AND WOULD NOT ENGAGE TILL ALMOST TO THE FLOOR  2.  WHILE WAITING AT A SIGNAL THE CAR ENGINE APPEARS TO BE REVVING UP AND SHAKING  3. RATTLING NOISE EMANATING FROM THE MUFFLER LINKAGE   4.  LOW FUEL WARNING LIGHT COMES ON WHEN GAGE IS STILL AT  TANK.    OF GRAVE CONCERN IS AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED LAST FRIDAY, AUGUST 8, 2003 WHILE MY WIFE WAS TAKING MY SON TO CELEBRATE HIS 6TH BIRTHDAY AT SUMMER CAMP.   THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED:  AFTER MAKING A TURN ON A STEEP HILL MY WIFE PROCEEDED DOWN THE HILL. WHILE GOING DOWN THE HILL THE BRAKES COMPLETELY FAILED TO OPERATE AND THE FOLLOWING LIGHTS ILLUMINATE ON THE DASH , BATTERY, OIL, DOOR OPEN WARNING LIGHTS. THE ENGINE WAS STILL ON AND SHE HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.   WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT, THE VEHICLE WAS NOT GOING FAST AND WE WERE ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP.  MY WIFE WAS EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED AND UPSET BY THE INCIDENT. SHE WAS ALMOST IN A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT!  WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO BEAVERTON HONDA WHO ADVISES US THUS FAR THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEMS. YOU CAN SURELY UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.    WE WOULD LIKE HONDA OF AMERICA TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO PROTECT OUR FAMILY AND IT'S BRAND:  1.  PROVIDE US WITH A LOANER ODYSSEY UNTIL& (2)  2.  EXCHANGE OUR ODYSSEY WITH THE SAME EXACT VEHICLE FROM A DIFFERENT FACTORY OR FULLY REFUND OUR PURCHASE.    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

THE HONDA MECHANIC EXPERIENCED   STRONG DISCOMFORT AT THIS SPEED.  IF YOU GO TO THE LEGAL  RURAL SPEED LIMIT 65 MPH, THE PAIN BECOMES IN MY CASE SEVER . IF  SOME OPENS THE REAR WINDOW AT THAT SPEED IN MY CASE IT WILL CAUSE ME MAJOR PROBLEMS.  FIRST I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO HEAR AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE TO YIELD.  I WOULD BE BUSY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE PAIN AND MAY LOSE CONTROL OF MY CAR.  PEOPLE HAVING DOGS IN THEIR VEHICLE AND LEAVING THE BACK WINDOW OPEN WILL EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM.  I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE BUYING THE VEHICLE AND THIS IS MY FIRST SUV OR ANYTHING LARGER THAN A 2DR COUPE  PASSENGER VEHICLE.  I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IF  I  KNEW THIS FIRST.  ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU.  *AK",
