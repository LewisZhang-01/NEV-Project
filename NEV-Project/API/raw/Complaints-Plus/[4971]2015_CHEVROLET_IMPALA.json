We had the SBZA-Side Blind Zone Alert system replaces in December of 2019, at a big cost to us of $1000, at local Chevrolet dealer. The new detection system only lasted about 15-16 months or March-April of 2021 before it started acting up again. When I called the Chevrolet dealer up to complain about the problem, they told me that there was only a 1 year warranty on brand new part and it being over 1 year old now, it was out of warranty!! Arrgghh!! We left it at that and it didn't cause too much of a hassle as I turned off detection system, using car radio settings and we only had a message on dash, which we could turn off and live with as we didn't have another $1000, out of our pocket, to get fixed. Then in November of 2021 and onwards, the light on drivers mirror would come on, stay on or blink off and on but doesn't always stay on. Now as of February 26 2022, we are having many of the same issues and things happening, that we had back in 2019, where the car is hard to start, dash doesn't work properly along with many safety warning lights coming on the dash, sounds, speedometer not working, no radio, no turn signals, no HVAC, windows don't function properly, etc, etc. It usually goes away, after 10 minutes or so, then is normal again, then goes berserk again, off and on. This is now happening more often each day and is a huge safety issue, esp with our daughter using the car now, to get back and forth to work. She has panicked each time this happens. We bought car with 72,000 miles on it back in May of 2018 and it currently only has 126,300 miles on it. We love this car otherwise as it's been a real great car but now with this stupid problem again and so soon, we are not sure what to do. Thank you very much.",

As we were merging over to exit lanes to get on the ramp to exit the freeway the power steering failure light came on and simultaneously all my power steering was gone. I literally lost control control of my car. I was in the midst of turning when the car swerved and at 70 MPH it was very dangerous situation. My wife and I had just switched driving places several miles back. She panicked and said she couldn't imagine what she would have done if that had happened to her. She also swore to never drive that car again. I don't know how many times this has happened to others but I can say with all honesty this is a very serious problem. There wasn't an accident but I did cause everyone near me on the road to swerve and brake suddenly to avoid colliding with my vehicle. As of today the car hasn't been repaired and I haven't relayed this to the dealership. That being said even if they were for some miraculous divine reason to repair it for free the danger of this occurring again is still there. This feature is dangerous and I pray something is done about it.",

AT THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THE FUEL PUMP WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. I FOUND IT ODD IN A BRAND NEW CAR, BUT FIGURED IT WAS A FLUKE. IN OCT. 2016 IT HAPPENED AGAIN! THE VEHICLE QUICKLY DROPPED FROM 60MPH OR SO, DOWN TO 30MPH AND I WAS ALMOST HIT FROM BEHIND BY A SEMI. I PUT ON MY HAZARDS AND EXITED AFTER DRIVING A MILE OR SO IN THE EMERGENCY LANE. THIS TIME, I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THEY WOULD NEED TO TOW IT BACK. AFTER THEY CHECKED OUT THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS ONCE AGAIN THE FUEL PUMP. 2 FUEL PUMPS AND TWO NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES UNDER 20K MILES. I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THEY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING.I COULD NOT CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS CAR IN FEAR. THE REASON WE DECIDED TO LEASE A NEW VEHICLE WAS TO HAVE A SAFE, RELIABLE CAR. WE WERE INFORMED BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE SUDDEN REDUCTION OF POWER (RESULTING IN 2 NEAR ACCIDENTS) WAS A \"SAFETY FEATURE\" IN THE PARTICULAR TRIM PKG OF OUR VEHICLE.

THERE ARE OTHERS, NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE TO OPERATE THE DRIVER INFO CENTER BY SEVERAL CLICKS TO ACCESS THEM. NOT VERY CONSISTENT.     THE HORN IS MORE DIFFICULT TO OPERATE THAN ANY OTHER CAR IN MY LIFE! IN THE PAST, IF YOU PUSH THE LITTLE HORN ICON, IT BLOWS. WITH THIS CAR, YOU MUST PUSH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WHEEL; I FOUND THIS OUT BY TESTING IT OVER AND OVER. THE HORN WILL NOT WORK IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION BY MOST PEOPLE.     SPEAKING OF COVERED CONTROLS BY THE STEERING WHEEL, THE START/STOP BUTTON IS OBSCURED UNLESS YOU TURN THE WHEEL OR LEAN SIDEWAYS. IF YOU JUST PULL INTO YOUR DRIVEWAY NORMAL, YOU CAN'T SEE IT. THE EMERGENCY 4-WAY FLASHER BUTTON IS NEXT TO THE START BUTTON, AND IS ALSO OBSCURED BY THE STEERING WHEEL.     ELECTRICAL, MINOR BUT ANNOYING ISSUES INCLUDE THE HVAC SYSTEM AND MUSIC STORAGE.

BEFORE THE MY LINK FAILURE I KEPT HEARING A ROARING NOISE ON THE CAR AND SOMETIMES SMELLING A BURNING ODOR. I ASKED A LOCAL MECHANIC WHAT THAT COULD BE AND HE GAVE ME THE OPTION OF BALL BEARINGS, TIRES COULD MAKE THE NOISE AND CHECK THE BRAKES. I LOOKED ON YOUR WEBSITE FOR ANY RECALLS ON THE IMPALA AND THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PADS STICKING TO THE TIRE THAT COULD RESULT IN A FIRE. I ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO FIX THE BRAKES RECALL. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE BRAKES, BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE SOFTWARE. I ASKED THE OWNER TO REFUND MY MONEY, BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR. HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT AND TOLD ME IT WAS A USED CAR. I COULD TRADE THE CAR FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE AS A USED CAR TRADE IN. THIS DEALERSHIP KNEW THERE WAS A SAFETY RISK WITH THE BRAKES AND NO REPAIR FOR THE POSSIBLE FAILURE AND STILL SOLD ME THIS VEHICLE. THEY FAILED TO  DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO ME. IF MY CAR CAUGHT FIRE GOING DOWN AN INTERSTATE I WOULD NOT KNOW IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE, PLUS I TAKE MY 83 YR OLD MOTHER IN THE CAR; I MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO GET HER OUT. THIS DEALERSHIP DID NOT CARE ABOUT MY SAFETY IN DRIVING THIS CAR. I WAS GIVEN A IMPALA LOANER WHILE THEY REPAIRED THE GPS AND IT ALSO HAS A BURNING ODOR. GENERAL MOTORS DOES NOT NEED TO SELL ANY CARS WITH THIS ISSUE UNTIL A FIX IS GIVEN. I COULD SEE IF I HAD THE CAR BEFORE A RECALL NOTICE, BUT I BOUGHT IT AFTER THE RECALL. THIS IS PURE NEGLIGENCE ON GENERAL MOTORS PART AND RED RIVER CHEVY. I WANT ALL OF MY MONEY BACK.",
