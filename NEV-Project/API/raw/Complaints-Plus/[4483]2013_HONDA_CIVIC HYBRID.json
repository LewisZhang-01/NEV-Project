I reported this to the dealer today when I got an oil change however they wanted to charge me $138 for a diagnostic check which is unacceptable. Airbags are essential safety systems. This cost should be on the manufacturer not the customer. Since there have been many complaints filed regarding this issue by 2013 Civic owners, it should be investigated by NHTSA for a recall.

THE DAY I BOUGHT IT, AS I WAS PULLING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT OF THE CREDIT UNION WHERE I MET THE SELLER THE POWER STEERING FAILED. A YELLOW WARNING LIGHT THAT LOOKS LIKE A STEERING WHEEL WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT CAME ON ON THE DASH, AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO STEER THE VEHICLE. I PUT IT IN PARK, HIT THE HAZARDS AND TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF FOR FEAR OF HITTING SOMEONE. I CONTACTED THE SELLERS AND THEY CAME BACK. WE DISCUSSED HAVING IT TOWED TO THE SHOP, AND THE PREVIOUS OWNER GOT IN IT, TO RE-PARK IT SOMEWHERE MORE OUT OF THE WAY WHILE WE WAITED FOR AAA. AT THIS TIME, THE CAR STARTED UP FINE, NO WARNING LIGHT WAS PRESENT AND HE WAS ABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE IT INTO A PARKING SPOT. HE SUGGESTED THAT HE JUST DRIVE IT TO THE SHOP, AND I RIDE OVER THERE WITH HIS WIFE. SO WE DID, AND THEY HOOKED IT UP TO THE COMPUTER AT THE SHOP, AND INFORMED ME THAT IT DIDN'T THROW ANY CODES, AND THAT \"THE COMPUTER DOESN'T LIE\" THEY TOLD ME THAT SINCE IT DROVE OVER THERE FINE, TO JUST TAKE IT HOME, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  SO I DID, AND I DROVE IT AROUND FOR A COUPLE WEEKS UNTIL ON THE 5TH OF APRIL, AGAIN PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE IT HAPPENED AGAIN, YELLOW STEERING WHEEL LIGHT AND ALL. EXCEPT THIS TIME THE BRAKES FAILED TOO. NOT ONLY COULD I NOT STEER, I COULD NOT STOP. I ENDED UP DRAGGING THE FRONT END OVER A FLOWERBED WITH A CURB, AND RIPPING OFF THE BUMPER. THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND IS NOW AT A HONDA DEALERSHIP AWAITING REPAIRS PENDING PROCESSING OF WARRANTY PAPERWORK. THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS HURT IN EITHER OF THESE INCIDENTS, BUT IT COULD'VE EASILY BEEN DIFFERENT. THESE POWER STEERING FAILURES ARE KNOW TO, AND WERE INVESTIGATED BY THE NHTSA IN 2013.

IT CONTINUED TO COME ON WHILE DRIVING, AND EVENTUALLY STARTED COMING ON WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE CAR, STATIONARY. IT DOES NOT COME ON EVERY SINGLE TIME, BUT COMES ON VERY VERY  FREQUENTLY. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AND THEY NEED TO RECALL THE PROBLEM. I CALLED TO SEE HOW MUCH HONDA WOULD CHARGE TO FIX IT, AND THEY SAID $140 JUST TO DIAGNOSE, AND MULTIPLE REPORTS OF THE PARTS COSTING UP TO $1300 TO REPAIR. THIS IS RIDICULOUS FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE TO PAY THIS AMOUNT FOR A CAR AND A COMPANY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE AND TRUSTED BRANDS ON THE MARKET. THE REASON I CHOSE A HONDA CIVIC WAS BECAUSE OF THE LOW RATE OF PROBLEMS, AND THIS IS THE HUGEST PROBLEM THAT CAN OCCUR, A LIFE THREATENING PROBLEM, VERY DISAPPOINTED. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE REPORTS OF PEOPLE GETTING IN CRASHES AND THE AIRBAG NOT GOING OFF, HUGE SAFETY CONCERN, AND LIFE THREATENING, EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON.

FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR WITHOUT HITTING ANYONE OR ANYTHING. I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR AFTER THAT INCIDENT, SO I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE FAIRFAX HONDA DEALER IN FAIRFAX, VA. THE DEALER CHECKED IT OUT AND SAID THAT THE REASON THE BREAKS FAILED WAS DUE TO A FAILURE IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THAT A PART # 01469-TR2-355 SERVO SET NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THE PART IS GOING TO COST AROUND $3400 AND IS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, THE PART IS ALSO ON INTERNATIONAL BACKLOG AND IT WILL SOON BE A MONTH AND I STILL DON'T HAVE A CAR. BUT NOW I AM THINKING THAT IT SOUNDS STRANGE FOR THE BREAKS TO DEPEND ON THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM OF THE CAR AND THAT IT COULD BE A DESIGN FLAW AND IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME. ONE OF THE SCARIEST EXPERIENCES IS TO HAVE YOUR BREAKS FAIL WHILE DRIVING AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN.

THE ONLY WAY I CAN LOOK AT THE ROD IS TO LIFT MY SHOULDERS OFF THE SEAT BACK, AND THEN MY ENTIRE UPPER BODY WEIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY MY NECK.    THE PROBLEM IS THE HEADREST IS AT LEAST 1 INCH TOO FAR FORWARD.    MY WIFE CANNOT SIT IN THE CAR FOR MORE THAT 30 MINUTES WITHOUT GETTING A HEADACHE.  MY WIFE IS A PHYSIOTHERAPIST WITH 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE.   HER COMMENT IS THAT THE HEADRESTS ARE FORCING US TO SIT IN ERGONOMICALLY INCORRECT POSITIONS.    OLDER CARS HAD VERTICAL HEADRESTS THAT DID NOT CAUSE THIS PROBLEM.    I UNDERSTAND THE NEW HEADREST POSITIONS ARE DUE TO NHTSA REGULATIONS PHASED IN  2009 TO PREVENT WHIPLASH.    THE ONLY WAY I CAN DRIVE MY CAR NOW IS TO PULL THE HEADREST OUT AND PUT THEM IN BACKWARDS.  THIS OBVIOUSLY RESULTS IN LESS WHIPLASH PROTECTION THAN EVEN THE OLD VERTICAL HEADRESTS    FROM A WEB SEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THAT MANY OTHER CAR OWNERS ARE BEING FORCED TO DO THE SAME THING.    NOW IN MANY NEW CARS YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE HEADREST TO TURN IT AROUND.      BECAUSE OF THIS NHTSA RULING I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A NEW CAR, AND THE CAR I DRIVE IS NOT SAFE IN THE CASE OF A REAR END COLLISION.    (NOTE:  I LIVE IN CANADA BUT AM AFFECTED BY THIS NHTSA RULING.  THE ZIP CODE AND PHONE NUMBER BELOW ARE NOT VALID, AS ONLY US INFORMATION IS ALLOWED IN THESE FIELDS).  *TR",

AFTER PULLING THE CAR ON TO THE SHOULDER, I HAVE PUT THE CAR ON TO PARKING GEAR FOR FEW MINUTES AND THEN AGAIN SHIFTED BACK TO DRIVE.
