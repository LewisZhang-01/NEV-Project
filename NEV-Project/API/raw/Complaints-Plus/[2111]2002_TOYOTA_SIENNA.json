THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OF THE WHEELS. BY SHEER LUCK THIS STEERING FAILURE OCCURRED IN A PARKING LOT AFTER JUST TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE. HAD THIS STEERING FAILURE OCCURRED AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS, THIS MAY HAVE BEEN FATAL.   THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE SAME MAJOR ATLANTA AREA TOYOTA DEALER AND THE CAUSE OF THE STEERING FAILURE WAS IDENTIFIED AS \"STEERING JOINT BOLT BACKED OFF FROM CONNECTION\". I WAS TOLD THAT THE STEERING FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY ONE BOLT COMING LOOSE. THE STEERING FAILURE WAS CORRECTED BY \"RE-TIGHTENED' BOLT WITH LOCK TIGHT\".  IN SUMMARY, THE REPAIR OF A GEAR SHIFT BY A CERTIFIED TOYOTA DEALER SERVICE CENTER RESULTED IN COMPLETE STEERING FAILURE DUE TO ONE BOLT THAT \"BACKED OFF FROM CONNECTION\" OR THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY TIGHTENED OR SECURED.  IT IS VERY CONCERNING THAT TOYOTA?S STEERING COLUMN DESIGN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE COMPLETE STEERING FAILURE WHEN ONE BOLT COMES LOOSE. IT IS ALSO A MAJOR ISSUE THAT A CERTIFIED TOYOTA DEALER SERVICE CENTER IS UNABLE TO SAFELY DISSEMBLE AND REASSEMBLE THE STEERING COLUMN AND PROVIDE A SAFE AND DRIVABLE VEHICLE. I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT HOW OFTEN THIS TYPE OF STEERING FAILURE HAS OCCURRED ON THIS AND SIMILARLY DESIGNED TOYOTA VEHICLES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY CRASHES, SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATHS HAVE RESULTED FROM THIS ISSUE. THIS CERTAINLY CAN?T BE THE ONLY OCCURRENCE. I FEEL IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ALERT OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE AS WELL AS AUTHORIZED REPAIR CENTERS OF THE SITUATION OR ISSUE A RECALL TO ENSURE THAT THE STEERING JOINT BOLT IS SECURE.

THE ABS KICKED IN, BUT THE CAR SEEMED TO KEEP MOVING AND THE CRASH HAPPENED IN SLOW MOTION - IT WAS JUST AS I FELT IN THE MAZDA PROTEGE, WHEN THE ABS KICKED IN WHILE TRYING TO STOP ON AN ICY ROAD - THE CAR KEPT MOVING WITHOUT SEEMING TO SLOW DOWN.  I AM NOT SURE, BUT ALSO HAVE A VAGUE SENSE THAT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO WORK HARD TO PULL THE CAR FORWARD, POSSIBLY LIKE THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION REPORTED BY OTHERS IN A RECENT SPATE OF ACCIDENTS.

SINCE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH OPENING AND CLOSING THE SLIDING DOORS AND ISSUE WITH THE TRUNK.  IT FIRST STARTED WHEN THE TRUNK WOULD NOT OPEN ANY MORE.  THE LITTLE PIECE TO CLICK IT OPEN BROKE OFF.  NEXT, THE RIGHT PASSENGER SLIDING DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE, BUT COULD BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE.  EVENTUALLY, THE OUTSIDE HANDLE BROKE OFF (PROBABLY DUE THE INABILITY TO OPEN IT FROM THE INSIDE).  NEXT THE LEFT PASSENGER SLIDING DOOR STARTED TO SHOW SIMILARITIES TO THE RIGHT SLIDING PASSENGER DOOR.  EVENTUALLY, THIS HANDLE BROKE OFF AS WELL AND WOULD NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.  TO DATE, THE SLIDING DOOR ON THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT CAN NOT BE OPENED INSIDE OR OUT.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR US AND OUR FOUR KIDS.  THE KIDS HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE FRONT TO GET OUT OF THE VAN.      IT BECAME SOMEWHAT STRANGE TO ME WHEN I NOTICED THAT OTHER TOYOTA SIENNA MINIVANS HAD HANDLES MISSING OFF THE BACK PASSENGER SLIDING DOORS.   I THOUGHT, WHAT IS UP WITH THE QUALITY OF THE VANS?  MOST INDIVIDUALS DRIVING MINIVANS ARE TRANSPORTING CHILDREN, SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE VANS WERE CONSTRUCTED TO HANDLE THE CONSTANT OPENING AND CLOSING THAT OCCURS FROM THE BACK PASSENGERS.  I THINK THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A FAIR WAY.  WHEN WE WENT TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE TRUNK WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST OVER $200, SO WE TOOK THE OPTIONAL ROUTE OF LOADING GROCERIES, LUGGAGE, ETC. FROM THE INSIDE.  THE DOOR INCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED THIS YEAR, 2010.  WE HAVE OWNED OTHER VEHICLES WITH THE KIDS, NAMELY 1997 HONDA ODYSSEY THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY OF THE HANDLES MISSING OR ANY PROBLEMS WITH GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  I SENT A LETTER TO TOYOTA CORPORATE OFFICE ON AUGUST 22, 2010 VIA EMAIL, NO RESPONSE.  I PHONE TOYOTA CORPORATE OFFICE ON AUGUST 30, 2010 AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY (I ALREADY KNEW THIS) AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AT THIS TIME. *TR",

THEY ADJUSTED MY ALIGNMENT AND  CHECKED MY TIRE PRESSURE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, TO NO AVAIL.  TUESDAY, JULY 3, 2007, I STOPPED BY KAUFFMAN AND TOLD THEM THERE WAS APPARENTLY AN UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT CAUSED MY VAN TO PULL SO SEVERELY THAT I HAD TO STRUGGLE TO KEEP IN MY LANE.  I REQUESTED THAT THEY DO AN IN-DEPTH CHECK TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  THEY FOUND THAT 3 OF THE 4 COOPER LIFE LINER TOURING TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE, ONE HAD A BUBBLE IN THE SIDEWALL.  KAUFFMAN EMPLOYEE AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY STRIKING A CURB OR OTHER OBJECT.  AGAIN, I KNEW I HAD NOT HIT THE TIRE ON ANYTHING.  KAUFFMAN EMPLOYEES REPLACED THE TIRES WITH 3 NEW COOPER LIFE LINER TOURING TIRES.  ON JULY 6, 2007, ONE OF THE NEW TIRES DEVELOPED A HUGE BUBBLE IN THE SIDEWALL AND LEFT ME STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF I-20 IN ALABAMA.  AN INTERNET SEARCH LED ME TO YOUR WEBSITE, WHERE I FOUND THAT THE TIRES KAUFFMAN PUT ON MY VEHICLE IN 2007 WERE RECALLED IN 2006.  I FEAR SOMEONE MAY BE INJURED OR KILLED BY THESE FAILING COOPER TIRES. *AK",
