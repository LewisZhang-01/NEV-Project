        "summary": "So we bought the car. In 2012 or 2013. And in 2014 we received a yellow letter in the mail saying that our car needed to be serviced for a recall. We set it up. Ended up taking it in To be serviced for the recalls. Not knowing in 2008 they recalled what is now going wrong in the car, I didn\u2019t say anything at the time we repaired it.  It they didn\u2019t either I believe and even if we didn\u2019t say anything they honestly should\u2019ve just repaired the part that was messed up for us and then let us know: now we have spent so much money towing our car back to our house so that it is safe, and have missed appointments, been stranded, I mean we have really, honestly and truly, very very compromised but this issue with the electrical system Our car is having all the time since this recall repair was administered:  NOW IT HAS JUST GOTTEN SO BAD WE CAN NOYT EVEN DRIVE IT. We will get stuck where ever we turn it off unfortunately. I\u2019ve not looked online at information taken all the necessary needs to find out if my vehicle was given the recall before we owned it just to be sure too, it was not. I know that everything that I have read relates directly perfectly to Every single issue that we are have ig Now on our car. The recall from 2014 the key doesn\u2019t come out the ignition anymore and that\u2019s very good, but I know that The CADILLAC Dealer, DID NOT!! Install any other part into the car but that service it asked for. Like beyond a doubt I don\u2019t know what to do and would love to be able to get some answers soon. Thank you very much.

BUT THIS IS THE REASON THEY'RE SALES HAVE DECLINED AND HAD TO STOP MAKING DEVILLED, NOBODY BUYS THEM BECAUSE GM WON'T RECALL THESE ISSUES. DUH GM ALMOST WENT OUT OF BUSINESS YRS AGO FROM STUFF LIKE THIS, THEY DON'T CARE. SO WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY A GM VEHICLE? THIS WILL BE MY LAST IS THESE ISSUES ARE NOT RECALLED AS THE LABOR IS THE ONLY REASON CADILLACS ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR, PARTS ARE REASONABLE.",

THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 69,000 MILES. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, I NOTICED THE RIGHT SIDE HID HEADLIGHT FLICKERING AND GOING OUT WHILE DRIVING.  THINKING IT WAS A BULB, I SPOKE TO THE DEALER BY PHONE WHO ADVISED IT MAY BE A BULB, BALLAST OR LOOSE CONNECTION. FROM RESEARCH AND DEALER CONVERSATION, I LEARNED IT WAS A COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING REPAIR JUST TO REPLACE THE BULB, DUE TO DESIGN ISSUES REQUIRING REMOVAL OF THE ENTIRE BUMPER COVER JUST TO ACCESS THE HEADLIGHT. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR, BUT WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. SINCE THEN, THE FLICKERING HAS GOTTEN WORSE, NOW AFFECTING BOTH HEADLIGHTS. THEY RANDOMLY FLICKER OFF AND ON WHILE DRIVING PROVING TO BE A DISTRACTION TO ME, AS WELL AS DRIVERS OF OTHER VEHICLES.  IT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE AS THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO GO OUT. A SEARCH OF THIS ISSUE VIA GOOGLE REVEALS THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INSTANCE WITH MY VEHICLE, BUT IN FACT, IS VERY WIDESPREAD WITH MANY DOCUMENTED CASES MIRRORING MY SITUATION. CADILLAC / GM TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NOT OFFERED ANY RELIEF TO AN ISSUE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT. PER THE DEALER, REPAIR OF THE BALLAST COULD BE WELL OVER $1000. HOWEVER, REVIEWING OTHER'S EXPERIENCE, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE SUCCESS IN FINDING OR REPAIRING THE ISSUE.  CADILLAC IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FLAGSHIP FOR GM AND A PREMIUM AUTOMOBILE. I WOULD THINK RELIABLE, SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE A MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR SAFETY. I ASK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTED ISSUES FROM MANY FRUSTRATED CADILLAC OWNERS WHO EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUES THAT I AM HAVING AND EXERT SOME PRESSURE ON GM / CADILLAC TO RECTIFY THIS KNOWN ISSUE.  *TR",

THE WORKAROUND IS TO IMMEDIATELY HIT THE GAS OR KILL THE CC TO GET BACK UP TO SPPED AND AVOID A REAR END COLLISION.    I HAD MY DEALER TEST THE UNIT AND VALIDATE THE ALIGNMENT.  THE UNIT TESTED ERROR FREE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM WITH A FLORIDA STATE POLICE CAR 1 TIME AND HILLSBOUROGH COUNTY POLICE CARS 2 TIMES.  I CONTACTED THE COUNTY AND THEY TOOK A FIRM POSITION THAT IT COULDN'T BE THEIR RADAR UNITS.    I FRANKLY DON'T CARE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.  IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THIS IT WILL ESCALATE TO A FATALITY INDUCING SITUATION.    I MAY ALO TAKE THE PFOBLEM TO THE FCC AS THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BANDWIDTH PROBLEM ON THE PART OF THE POLICE RADAR UNITS OR THE CADILLAC ADAPTIVE CC MODULE.    FIRSY FAILURE OCCURRED WHEN I WAS FOLLOWING A POLICE CRUISER WHO WAS APPROX 200 FEET AHEAD OF ME AND IN THE ADJACENT LANE (THE ONE TO MY RIGHT)  THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND NO ONE WITHIN 500 FEET TO THE REAR.  WITHOUT WARNING MY CAR WENT INTO EMERGENCT STOP AND SPUNDED THE PROXIMITY WARNING.  I TAPPED THE ON/OFF SWITCH AND BROUGHT THE CAR UP TO SPEED.    IT HAS ALSO FAILED AS I PASS A POLICE CAR THAT IS SITTING PERPENDICULAR TO THE ROAD.  THE DURATION IS SHORT AS YOU ARE RAPIDLY PASSING THRU THE RADAR CONE.  HOWEVER, I HAD THIS HAPPEN ON THE HOWARD FRANKLIN BRIDGE OVER TAMPA BAY AND THAT IS A TERRIBLE PLACE OF A CAR TO SUDDENLY SLOW DOWN WITH NO APPARANT WARNING.

RICH TRETHEWAY, THE HEAD TECHNICIAN AT THE WEAVER DEALERSHIP IN GRASS VALLEY WHO DROVE MY CAR AND THEN EXPLAINED TO US WHAT THE CAR DOES.  HERE IS WHAT THE CAR DOES FROM A DRIVING POINT OF VIEW.  WHEN GOING DOWN HILL OR TRYING TO SLOW DOWN, WHEN THE CAR REACHES ABOUT 25 MILES PER HOUR OR ABOUT 1000 RPM, IT THEN GIVES ITSELF GAS WHICH CAUSE A FEELING THAT ONE WOULD HAVE IF THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ON (IT IS NOT). THAT IS; THAT THE CAR SURGES FORWARD GOING UP ABOUT 600 OR 700 RPM.  THIS OCCURS WHEN I HAVE SHIFTED THE CAR DOWN TO 1ST  OR 2ND.  SINCE I LIVE IN AN AREA WITH MANY HILLS THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I DRIVE.  I SHIFT DOWN TO KEEP THE CAR FROM GOING EXCESSIVELY FAST DOWN THE HILLS.   WHEN I AM DRIVING AND WANT TO TAKE A CURVE AT 20 TO 25 MILES PER HOUR, THE CAR MANY TIMES SURGES FORWARD WHILE MY FOOT IS OFF THE THROTTLE; I HAVE TO USE THE BRAKE CONTINUALLY TO GET AROUND THE CURVES AND DOWN HILLS AT A SLOW ENOUGH SPEED TO BE SAFE.    THIS SURGING HAPPENED ONCE IN A PARKING LOT AS WE WERE TRYING TO PARK.  RICH WAS NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE THIS PROBLEM, BUT WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE OTHER SURGING PROBLEM.  THE CURE FOR THIS IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM RICH AND ONE OF THE OWNERS OF WEAVER IS TO ALWAYS DRIVE IN OVERDRIVE AND USE THE BRAKE INSTEAD OF SHIFTING DOWN.  IT ALSO DOES THIS IN OVERDRIVE.  I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE IS NO MECHANICAL REPAIR THAT GENERAL MOTORS HAS MADE FOR THIS CAR THEN SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO BE HELPFUL TO US. *JB",
