I DID HAVE A CLOSE CALL WHEN I WAS BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVE WAY AND THE CAR STOPPED MOVING, ALL OF A SUDDEN I DIDN'T HAVE REVERSE AND THE CAR THAT WAS DOWN THE ROAD WASN'T WANTING TO SLOW DOWN, HE DID END UP STOPPING FOR ME BUT WAS PISSED OFF, AND I WAS TOO, NO REASON FOR A 40,000 MILE CAR TO HAVE ISSUES LIKE THIS. AUDI QUOTES THIS REPAIR AT $2500.  IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY SINGLE AUDI PRODUCED IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD WITH A CVT TRANSMISSION HAS THIS ISSUE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A MANUFACTURES DEFECT  AND SHOULD BE RECALLED SO THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS.  AUDI HAS DENIED ME TO HELP WITH THESE COST, BUT I KNOW HAVE HELP OTHERS OUT, SO THEY ARE DEFIANTLY AWARE OF THERE ISSUE.  *TR",

I WAS SO EXCITED TO BUY THIS AUDI USED 4 YRS AGO WITH 80,000 MILES. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST COSTLY AND THE MOST UNSAFE VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED...STALLING OUT WAS NOT FUN AND VERY SCARY.  AUDI DEALERSHIPS HAVE BEEN TRAINED WELL TO DENY OWNING UP TO THE CAR'S DEFECTS. IS AUDI WAITING FOR AN ACCIDENT TO HAPPEN AND PEOPLE/CHILDREN DIE? I GUESS THE COST OF PAYING FOR THE COURT COST WHEN SOMEONE DIES IS NOT A BIG WORRY FOR THE COMPANY - PROBABLY COST MORE TO HAVE THE CARS RECALLED & SAFELY REPAIRED THAN TO PAY FOR COURT & FUNERAL COST.  I'M SURE AUDI  HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM SINCE 2003 AND REFUSE TO OWN UP TO THEIR 2003 MISTAKE FLOWING OVER TO THE 2004 MODELS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT AUDI WON'T \"STEP UP TO THE PLATE\" AND HAVE A RECALL. MAYBE THE AUDI COMPANY REALLY CAN'T REPAIR THE CAR AND THE PROBLEM WILL ALWAYS EXIST? I WOULD HOPE THEY HAVE SMART ENGINEERS THAT COULD FIX THE PROBLEM. AUDI REALLY IS COMING ACROSS AS HAVING POOR CUSTOMER CONCERNS FOR OUR SAFETY. WHAT A SHAME, I CAN BARELY MAKE ENDS MEET AND NOW, I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO TAKE MY CAR OUT OF THE SHOP...BUT, MAYBE IT'S A BLESSING - AT LEAST, MY CHILDREN AND I ARE SAFE BY NOT DRIVING THAT CAR. COME ON AUDI - RECALL NOW BEFORE SOME DIES!!!  AND, WHAT IS THE VEHICLE SAFETY FOLKS DOING FOR US??? I JUST AN ANGRY MOTHER HOPING SOMEONE WILL LISTEN & WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE NHTSA CAN HELP...I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT THIS CAR, I'M STILL MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR THE CAR THAT I'M SCARED TO DRIVE NOW.

THIS IS A \"NO KIDDING\" MATTER THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY THE RESPONSIBLE COMPANY TO SHOW THAT THEY REALLY CARE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS! *TR",

I RETURNED TO PITTSBURGH AFTER WORK AND I PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL AROUND 5 PM.  WE DROVE AND WENT TO DINNER.  WE DROVE AND ATTENDED AN EVENT AT 7:30 PM.    2.  FOLLOWING THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS EVENT AROUND 9:00 PM, WE DROVE SEVERAL  MILES TO OUR HOME.  AS WE WERE LEAVING DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH, AND ONE MILE FROM OUR HOME,  THE CAR'S ACCELERATOR PEDAL REMAINED DOWN ON ITS OWN, PUSHING THE CAR FORWARD.  I STOOD ON THE BRAKE TO STOP THE CAR AS WE CAME TO A STOP LIGHT.    I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL REMAINED IN THE DOWN POSITION WITH THE CAR ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN.  I ONCE AGAIN STOPPED THE CAR BY STANDING ON THE BRAKE.  I THEN TRIED TO LIFT THE PEDAL PHYSICALLY WITH MY HAND AND FOOT, BELIEVING THAT WOULD HELP.  I ALSO TRIED MOVING THE MAT.  THE CAR HAD BEEN INSPECTED TWO WEEKS EARLIER AND THE MAT LOCK WAS NOT PUT BACK ON.  THE CAR WAS MOVING ON ITS OWN.  I STOPPED THE CAR BY STANDING ON THE BRAKE, PUT IT IN PARK AND THE ENGINE REVVED VERY HIGH AND I QUICKLY TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. THIS HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE NEARLY 2 YEAR HISTORY OF OWNING THE CAR.  FOR ONE MILE, THE CAR'S ACCELERATOR WAS STUCK TO THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE.    3.  IN THE MORNING, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THAT SERVICES THE CAR AND HAD CONDUCTED THE INSPECTION TWO WEEKS EARLIER.  I USED MY AAA SERVICE TO TOW THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER DID START THE CAR AND THE PEDAL WAS NO LONGER STUCK.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS UNABLE TO RECREATE THE EVENT AND RETURNED MY CAR IN ONE WEEK STATING THEY HAD OPENED A FILE, CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER, AND THAT I COULD COME AND TAKE MY CAR BACK AND DRIVE IT.  IT APPEARED THEY DROVE IT 35 MILES IN THAT TIME PERIOD.  I AM DRIVING THE CAR AND I HAVE NOT USED MY CRUISE CONTROL. I REMAIN CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MYSELF, MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY.  I AM NOT SURE WHAT I SHOULD DO. *TR",

THE WATER PUMP FOUND IN OUR US MARKET VEHICLES HAS A PLASTIC IMPELLER THAT IS KNOWN TO SNAP, CRACK, OR LEAK CAUSING THE PART TO FAIL. I HAVE HAD TWO OF THESE PUMPS FAIL IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE FIRST ONE FAILED AT AROUND 74K IN JULY OF 2008 WHEN THE PART WAS NEARING IT'S REPLACEMENT DATE. THE SECOND FAILURE OCCURRED IN JANUARY 2010 AT ROUGHLY 98K MILES. SO I HAVE HAD TWO FAILURES IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERIOD.    NOW AUDI IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS BUT HAS NEVER HAD A RECALL OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THEIR FAULT FOR RELEASING A POORLY DESIGNED PART. WHEN A PUMP FAILS IT USUALLY GOES VERY QUICKLY. IN MY CASE IT LEAKED AND THEN I LOST AC COMPRESSION. I AM LUCKY THAT I KNOW CARS AND KNEW TO IMMEDIATELY PARK THE CAR AND GET IT INTO THE SHOP. I KNOW THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT ENGINE DAMAGE BECAUSE THE FAILED PUMP CAUSED OVERHEATING.

THIS FIXED THE SOUND ISSUE UNTIL OCTOBER OF 09. THE REPLACED FILTER WAS NOT CLOGGED CATASTROPHICALLY BUT WAS NOT AS PASSIVE AS THE NEW FILTER. IN  OCTOBER THE SOUND RETURNED AND KNOWING THE FILTER HAD BEEN REPLACED I NEW IT WAS THE PUMP. ON NOVEMBER 5TH 2009 THE CAR WOULD NOT START, THE PUMP WOULD NOT PRIME.

THE MILEAGE ON MY AUDI IS ONLY 38,000 MILES....VERY LOW MILEAGE FOR A FUEL PUMP TO GO OUT.  I DISCOVERED THAT THE 2003 FUEL PUMPS HAVE BEEN RECALLED, BUT AUDI OF AMERICA HAS DENIED MY CLAIM THAT MY '04 CAR'S FUEL PUMP (WHICH WAS ALSO MANUFACTURED IN '03) SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.   *TR",

THE ENGINE STARTED TO \"SKIP\" AND \"MISS\" THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND THE CHECK OIL INDICATOR CAME ON. I MANAGED TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY INTO A PARKING LOT. THE PERSON WITH ME CAN VERIFY THAT THE ENGINE/CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS BOUNCING OR VIBRATING.  PRIOR TO THAT, MY CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSTATE 264 IN NORFOLK, VA. IT WAS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THAT HIGHWAY. THE CAR STALLED WHEN I WAS LEAVING WORK. I DECIDED TO TRY TO MAKE IT HOME ONCE IT RESTARTED. ONCE I STARTED TO ACCELERATE ONTO THE INTERSTATE, THE CAR WOULD SPORADICALLY ACCELERATE. IT FELT LIKE A \"STOP AND GO\" SITUATION. IT PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE OVER A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 300 YARDS, FINALLY STALLING. THE DEALER SAID THEY COULD NO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. AUDI REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION ON MY CAR AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS.   THE FIRST TIME MY CAR WAS TOWED WAS FROM MY OWN LOCAL STREET: THE SAFEST PLACE OF THREE LOCATIONS WHERE I'VE BEEN TOWED.

IN LATE FEBRUARY OF 06, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WHEN I PUT THE GEAR ON D (DRIVE) OR R (REVERSE) AND GAVE GAS; THE CAR DID NOT MOVE AT ALL.  DASH BOARD INSTRUMENT WAS NOT RESPONSIVE EITHER.  INITIALLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS DUE TO COLD WEATHER. ON MARCH 13, 06, I WAS RUNNING ERRANDS IN A VERY BUSY AREA OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.  THE CAR WAS WARM AS IT HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.  I APPROACHED A BUSY INTERSECTION TO MAKE A LEFT TURN.  WHEN THE ROAD WAS CLEARED, I ATTEMPTED TO MOVE FORWARD BUT THE CAR WAS TOTALLY FROZEN - IT WOULD NOT MOVE REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL.  I WAS NOW FACING THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC OF THREE CARS BLOWING THEIR HORNS LIKE CRAZY.  I JUST COULD NOT MOVE THE CAR AND WAS TERRIFIED THAT I WOULD BE HIT BY THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC CAME TO AN ABRUPT STOP AND AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE CAR.  I WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THE AUDI OF TYSONS CORNER (HBL) IN VIENNA, VIRGINIA IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE CAR IN THAT DAY.  THE NEXT DAY (3/14) AFTERNOON, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SERVICE ADVISOR INDICATING THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR.  I INSISTED THAT THEY RECHECK AS I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES AND THAT THE LAST INCIDENT WAS COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL AS I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION.  THEY AGREED AND KEPT THE CAR FOR ANOTHER DAY; HOWEVER, THE NEXT DAY THEY CALLED AND SAID THE SAME THING - NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I PICKED THE CAR ON MARCH 16, 06.  WHILE WAITING IN THE LOBBY, I SAW ANOTHER AUDI A4 CONVERTIBLE DRIVER.  I APPROACHED HER ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AND ASKED IF SHE EXPERIENCED THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  SHE SAID YES AND THAT IS WHY SHE BROUGHT HER CAR IN ALONG WITH A REGULAR SERVICE CHECK.  SHE RECEIVED THE SAME FEEDBACK FROM THE AUDI OF TYSONS - NOTHING WRONG WITH HER CAR EITHER.  I HAVE THE NAME, PHONE NUMBER, ETC., OF THE OTHER DRIVER IF NEEDED.  *JB",

AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 MILES THE REAR RIGHT TIRE DEVELOPED A LARGE SIDEWALL BUBBLE.  THIS TIRE WAS IMMEDIATELY RELPACED WITH THE FULL SIZE SPARE (SAME TYPE, MODEL AND RIM).  CALLS TO THE DEALERSHIP, AUDI, USA AND PIRELLI WERE MET WITH LIMITED INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE AT BEST.  IN SUBSTANCE, I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD / WOULD DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  NOW A APPROXIMATELY 6000 MILES (3000 ON THE REPLACEMENT), THE SAME PROBLEM HAS DEVELOPED AT THE RIGHT REAR TIRE.  CALLS ONCE AGAIN ARE APPARENTLY FALLING UPON DEAF EARS.  UNDOUBTABLY WE HAVE A SAFTY ISSUE HERE (AS INDICATED BY SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS LODGED BY OTHER OWNERS OF P-6 TIRES) WHICH IS BEING INGNORE BY THE TIRE MANUFACTURER AS WELL AS AUDI, USA AND ITS DEALERS.  IN VIEW OF THE LACK OF RESPONSE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE SAFETY ISSUE, I'LL BE FORCED TO REPLACE ALL OF THESE OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE TIRES ON MY VEHICLE AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  I'M REQUESTING THAT THE NHTSA MAKE FURTHER INQUIRIES INTO THIS MATTER.  I WILL ALSO BE VERY WILLING TO PROVIDE MY DEFECTIVE TIRES TO THE NHTSA, OR ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT AGENCY, FOR TESTING, ETC.  FURTHERMORE, IF THE NHTSA, OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, COMPLAINTANTS, OWNERS, DEALERS, CONSUMER GROUPS, ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING LEGAL RECOURSE PLEASE CONTACT ME AS I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO ASSIST IN ENTERING INTO A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST PIRELLI, AUDI, ETC.

ON JULY 1, WITH 2389 MILES ON THE CAR, I HAD A BLOWOUT OF MY RIGHT REAR TIRE, WHICH IS A GOODYEAR M&S R235/17 LOW PROFILE HIGH PERFORMANCE TIRE. I NEVER HAD A SENSATION OF HITTING ANYTHING ON THE ROAD, BUT HAD ONLY SECONDS TO GET FROM THE FAST LANE OF I-5 IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO, CA ACROSS 5 LANES OF FREEWAY TRAFFIC AND AROUND A CALTRANS MAINTENENCE CREW ON THE SHOULDER, TO SAFETY. BY THE TIME I DID, THE TIRE TREAD HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WHEEL 360 DEGREES.  SIX DAYS LATER, WHILE HAVING THE TIRE REPLACED AT A LOCAL TIRE STORE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IN THE CAR. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AT MY NEXT OPPORTUNITY, WITH NOW 2750 MILES ON THE CAR.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE FILLER HOSE TO THE GAS TANK WAS PUNCTURED, REQUIRING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE GAS TANK, AS IT IS ALL ONE PEICE, THAT THE WIRES CONNECTING THE FUEL SYSTEM TO THE CENTRAL COMPUTER WERE DAMAGED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED, THAT A HOLE IN THE SHEATH AROUND THE SHOCK ABSORBER ON THAT WHEEL HAD BEEN PUNCTURED, REQUIRING POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE SHOCK, AND THAT THE ENTIRE WHEEL LINER ON THAT WHEEL WAS GONE AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE ESTIMATED COST FOR THIS IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $1600-2000. NEITHER AUDI, NOR THE DEALERSHIP, THUS FAR HAS TAKEN ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DESIGN FLAWS THAT CREATED THE POSSIBILITY FOR SUCH DAMAGE FROM A FLAT TIRE. I FREQUENTLY DRIVE ALONE, AND WE LIVE IN A HIGH FIRE DANGER AREA. I WAS DRIVING AROUND WITH A LEAKY GAS TANK FOR 5 DAYS BEFORE THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT EVEN WENT ON, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT A FAULTY SHOCK ABSORBER COULD HAVE CAUSED MY ALL WHEEL DRIVE TO FAIL.  I FEEL THAT THIS CAR IS UNSAFE FOR ME TO DRIVE.*AK",
