I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL TO FOLLOW THE FIRST VEHICLE AND THE CAR STALLED. THE CAR COULD NOT BE TURNED BACK ON OR PUT IN MOTION. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A PROBLEM PRIOR TO THIS THROTTLE BODY FAILURE. THE CAR WAS PUSHED OFF THE ROAD BY 3 PEOPLE AND INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT. THE PROBLEM THAT MADE THE VEHICLE UNSAFE WAS A DEFECTIVE FORD THROTTLE BODY. THE REFERENCE CONSUMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 13N03. I RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE JUNE 2014, BUT FORD ONLY SUGGESTED A RECALIBRATION (NOT REPLACEMENT). THE RECALIBRATION WAS COMPLETED AT FORD AUTONATION ON JUNE 23, 2014. FORD HAD ESTIMATED A THROTTLE BODY REDUCTION IN MOVABILITY AND NOT FAILURE. THE MILEAGE OF THIS MERCURY MARINER ON THE DATE OF REPAIR WAS 142551 AND THE IN-SERVICE DATE, 06/18/2010. THEREFORE, THE REIMBURSEMENT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER FORD'S EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 150000 MILES/10 YEARS. THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED 06/08/2020. TEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. FORD CLAIMS THEY WILL NOT REIMBURSE FOR THE THROTTLE BODY FAILURE. THIS WAS WELL-DOCUMENTED IN THE PREVIOUS CLAIM 13N03 AND THIS CASE SHOULD BE REOPENED, BASED ON THE FATALITY POSSIBILITY OF A THROTTLE BODY FAILURE WITH THE ORIGINAL PART THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE, WHICH WAS ALSO RE-CALIBRATED PER FORD'S RECALL IN 2014. THIS INCIDENT PROVES THAT FORD'S RE-CALIBRATION DID NOT PREVENT FAILURE OF THE THROTTLE BODY. ASKING FOR A RECALL FOR THE THROTTLE BODY FOR THE SIMILAR MAKES AND MODELS STILL IN CIRCULATION AS IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD AND ALSO REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS SERVICE FOR VEHICLES THAT HAD IT COMPLETED.  *TR",

SINCE WE ALREADY PAID FOR THE REPAIR ($381.32) AT A FORD DEALERSHIP, WE TRIED TO GET THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT FORD OWES US. WE WERE INFORMED WE HAD TO HAVE THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT, WHICH TO THIS DAY IS STILL PACKED UP IN STORAGE IF WE HAVE IT AT ALL BECAUSE WE MOVED FROM FL TO NC AND ARE STILL INVOLVED IN BUYING A NEW HOME. THE BOTTOM LINE IS FORD (CORP) IS REFUSING TO HONOR THEIR AGREEMENT TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS. THE CRAZIEST PART OF THIS WHOLE DILEMMA IS THAT FORD HAS AND CONTROLS 100% OF THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO PROCESS OUR REIMBURSEMENT, BUT ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO DO SO WITHOUT THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT. I COULD UNDERSTAND IF WE HAD THIS REPAIR DONE AT SOME UNRELATED, THIRD PARTY SERVICE FACILITY. HOWEVER, WE WENT TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE RECORD OF COMPLETING THE REPAIR AND US PAYING THEM FOR THE REPAIR. SO AGAIN, FORD HAS ALL THE INFORMATION (PROOF) IN THEIR POSSESSION TO TAKE CARE OF THIS REIMBURSEMENT, BUT REFUSES TO DO SO. I HAVE CALLED THE CUSTOMER (DIS)SATISFACTION DEPARTMENT AT FORD CORPORATE, BUT THAT IS LIKE TALKING TO A BRICK WALL AS FAR AS ANYONE HAVING IN COMMON SENSE, ACCOUNTABILITY OR DECENCY TO DO THE RIGHT THING (CERTAINLY ANY KIND OF GOOD WILL IS LACKING IN THAT ORGANIZATION). SO HERE I AM HAVING TO COMPLAIN TO THE NHTSA TO GET FORD TO DO WHAT THEY PROMISED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I LOOK FORWARD TO A TIMELY REPLY LETTING ME KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE THIS HANDLED.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK DONE. AS A SIDE ISSUE I ASKED THAT THE A/C BE CHECKED.

THESE PARTICLES CANNOT BE FLUSHED OUT COMPLETELY AND THE ONLY FIX IS TO REPLACE ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE A/C, FOR $2700!!!!!  BECAUSE OF THE COST I HAVE NOT HAD THE WORK DONE. THE DEALER PEOPLE ADVISED ME TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA AND TO CONTACT FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS. I HAVE DONE THAT, BUT NO RELIEF HAS BEEN OFFERED.

THE WRENCH TOOL LIGHT LIT UP ON THE DASH BOARD AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO LOOSE SPEED.  THE CHANGE IN POWER AND SPEED WAS QUICK AND I HAD TO QUICKLY CHECK THE SURROUNDING TRAFFIC AND PULL THE CAR OVER TO AVOID AND ACCIDENT.  AFTER PULLING OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I CUT THE CAR COMPLETELY OFF AND IT STARTED BACK UP.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND I WAS ADVISED TO REPLACE THE FILTER.  I PURCHASED A FILTER FROM FORD AND MY CAR RAN SMOOTHLY FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS. I WOULD PUSH ON THE ACCELERATOR BUT IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  EACH TIME THE WRENCH TOOL WOULD APPEAR AND THE ENGINE LIGHT WOULD COME ON. I HAVE LOST SPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION.  AFTER MY CAR STARTED TO CUT OFF AGAIN FOLLOWING THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW FILTER I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO PURCHASE THROTTLE BODY SPRAY.  THEY CLEANED OUT THE THROTTLE BODY AND THE CAR DROVE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL I BEGAN EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  SOME TIMES I WOULD HAVE  TO CUT MY CAR OFF A FEW TIMES AND RESTART IT ON ONE ROUND TRIP.  I KEEP REGULAR MAINTENANCE ON THIS CAR, CHANGING THE OIL AND ROTATING THE TIRES, ETC.  I PURCHASED THE CAR IN DECEMBER 2012 BECAUSE THE CAR I HAD  OVER $2,500 OF NEEDED MAINTENANCE. I NEEDED A RELIABLE CAR TO GET AROUND AS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORTATION FOR MY FAMILY.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER A FEW TIMES AND THEY EXPLAINED THE CODE AND EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM: TROUBLE CODE P2111, THROTTLE BODY ACTUATOR STUCK OPEN AND CLOSED.  I REALLY HOPE THIS INVESTIGATION IS EXPEDITED AND THAT FORD RECALLS THE MERCURY MARINER 2010 DUE TO THE FAULTY THROTTLE BOTTLE.  I HAVE HAD ZERO MAINTENANCE ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE OTHER THAN THE THROTTLE BODY ISSUES.  *TR",

I'M AMAZED WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS AND PROBLEMS I'VE SEEN ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE AND NO RECALL HAS BEEN MADE. THIS IS DANGEROUS.
