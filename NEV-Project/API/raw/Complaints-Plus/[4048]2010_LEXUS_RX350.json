        "summary": "We were 2 hours into a 9 hour drive when I noticed smoke in the rear view mirror.  I continued to drive as I thought it may have been coming from another vehicle.  I drove to the nearest gas station (about 3 mi) and pulled in.  Upon exiting the vehicle,  we found the back window and the entire back of the SUV covered in oil.  There were no warning lights and no engine noises.  We checked the oil and it was so low that it did not register on the dip stick.  We added 2 quarts of oil which then registered on the tip of the dip stick.  We then added another quart of oil and drove to a nearby service station (1/2 mi).  The mechanic could not diagnose the problem since he couldn't put it on his lift (it was occupied by another vehicle).  He contacted two other service stations in the area and found one less than a mile away that had a lift open.  We added 2 more quarts of oil and drove to the next service station.  The mechanic put the vehicle on the lift and quickly found the problem - a pin hole in the oil line.   He was able to find a replacement part (not the original part as it had been discontinued) and get us up and running the same day.  We were very fortunate that I noticed the smoke - if I had not noticed it and continued to drive (we were 10 minutes from driving over a bridge tunnel) it could have been catastrophic.  We finished the 7 additional hours of driving that day and after being gone for a week, have now returned home (another 9 hours).  The mechanic told me the part had been recalled, but when I searched this sight, I found lots of similar reports - but no recall.  Coincidentally, I had had the oil changed 4 days before beginning this trip.  It is surprising that there are so many reports of this incident, but no recall by Lexus.",

I APPLIED MY FOOT TO THE BRAKES AND THE CAR SLOWED VERY SLIGHTLY, BUT STARTED TO BUCK A LITTLE AND THEN ONCE AGAIN FELT LIKE IT KICKED INTO A HIGHER GEAR. MY DASHBOARD WAS FLASHING \" BRAKE FAILURE\" AS I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW THAT MY FOOT WAS FIRMLY PLANTED DOWN ON THE BRAKES. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE FEW CARS ON THE ROAD AND ONLY ONCE DID I HAVE TO PASS A CAR ON A BLIND CURVE HOPING NO ONE WAS APPROACHING FROM THE OTHER WAY, SO AS TO AVOID RAMMING A CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I HAD RESOLVED IN MY MIND THAT I WAS GOING TO CRASH, AND WAS TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO TAKE THE CAR OFF THE ROAD WHILE TRYING TO MINIMIZE INJURY TO ME. I STOPPED LOOKING AT MY SPEED, BUT IT WAS CLEARLY IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH IN A 35 MPH ZONE. I WAS LUCKY THAT DAY, SINCE THERE WERE FEW CARS ON THE ROAD AND THE STRETCH OF ROAD I WAS ON WAS FAIRLY STRAIGHT. I DROVE THIS WAY FOR ABOUT 1.5 MILES WHEN IT THEN OCCURRED TO ME TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL. ONCE I DID THIS THE CAR EVENTUALLY REDUCED SPEED TO ABOUT 5-10 MPH. I THREW THE CAR INTO PARK AND JUMPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE, WHICH AT THIS POINT WAS ENGULFED IN SMOKE FROM THE FAILED BRAKES.

I KNOW FACTUALLY THAT THE PAD WAS NOT STUCK, SINCE I LOOKED DOWN AT MY FEET DURING THE EPISODE AND SAW MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, AND THE ACCELERATOR PAD IN ITS NORMAL POSITION.

I AM LUCKY THAT A GUARDRAIL PREVENTED ME FROM GOING OFF A CLIFF AND I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT OTHER DRIVERS WILL NOT BE SO FORTUNATE.    WHILE DRIVING DOWN A SLIGHT INCLINE ON AN INCH OF SO OF FRESH SNOW IN INCLINE VILLAGE, NEVADA AT 25 MPH, I FOUND MYSELF OUT OF CONTROL EVEN THOUGH I HAD AT LEAST 200 FEET TO SLOW DOWN FOR A TURN; I HIT A GUARDRAIL AT 15 MPH, CAUSING $20,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY LEXUS RX 450H. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I TRADED IT THE NEXT DAY FOR AN RX 350H TO AVOID ANOTHER SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.    SO HOW DID THE SITUATION I DESCRIBE HAPPEN? WHEN I BRAKED, I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE WHEELS WERE LOCKED AND THAT THE STEERING NO LONGER WORKED (I HAVE FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE DRIVING IN SNOW, HAVING BEEN IN SNOW SINCE MY YOUTH IN CANADA) AND I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE TO REGAIN STEERING CONTROL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WHEELS REMAINED LOCKED AND I RAN OUT OF TIME.     MY LEXUS RX 450H HAD LESS THAN 2,300 MILES AT THE TIME. I ACQUIRED IT WHEN MY LEASE ON MY RX 400H RAN OUT. WHILE I WAS AWARE THAT THE RX 400H LOCKED ITS WHEELS IN SLIPPERY ROAD CONDITIONS (A KNOWN ATTRIBUTE DOCUMENTED IN THE USER MANUAL), I KNEW HOW TO REACT AND NEVER PANICKED WHEN THE WHEELS LOCKED; I SIMPLY REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE AND REGAINED STEERING CONTROL.    SO WHAT MAKES THE RX 450H DIFFERENT THAN THE RX 400? A LOOK AT THE POWER GAUGE WHILE DRIVING IDENTIFIES THE DIFFERENCE QUICKLY; IN THE RX 400, THE CHARGING SYSTEM DOES NOT TRY TO CAPTURE ENERGY TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES EXCEPT WHEN ONE IS TOUCHING THE BRAKE PEDAL, WHILE IN THE RX 450H, THE CHARGING SYSTEM TRIES TO CAPTURE ENERGY AS SOON AS ONE REMOVES HIS/HER FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL, NOT WHEN ONE TOUCHES THE BRAKE. FROM AN ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE, IT MAKES SENSE TO LEVERAGE THE FACT THAT THE DRIVER IS INTENDING TO SLOW AS S/HE HAS REMOVED THEIR FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL BUT IT IS A DISASTER WHEN THE ROADWAY IS ICY.  *TR",

NEVER DID THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE SWITCH ON AND CORRECT THE SLIDE.  I LOOKED IN THE MANUAL FOR THE METHOD TO MANUALLY ACTIVATE 4 WHEEL DRIVE BUT COULDN'T FIND IT.  I CONTACTED LEXUS.

IT DIDN'T WORK AS IT ONLY CHANGES THE GEAR AND ACCELERATION CHARACTERISTICS LIKE ANY OTHER WINTER/SUMMER SWITCH.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT IT SHOULD WORK AT HIGH SPEEDS WHEN MORE POWER IS NEEDED.
