THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND WE PROCEEDED.  THE OTHER VEHICLE FOR NO APPARENT REASON STOPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AND I REAR ENDED HIM AT A SPEED OF APPROX. 5 MPH.  ON IMPACT BOTH MY DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  MY TOTAL REPAIR COST ON MY VEHICLE IS $2,917.31.  THIS FIGURE IS BROKE DOWN LIKE THIS: LABOR 891.57, PAINT 163.88, AND PARTS $1,861.86 THIS IS WITH SALES TAX.  OF THE PARTS PRICE $1,515,24 IS AIR BAGS AND SENOR REPLACEMENT.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I FEEL THE AIR BAGS SHOULD NOT HAVE DEPLOYED ON AN IMPACT SUCH AS THIS.  ANOTHER  PROBLEM AROUSED WHEN THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED, MY HATCHBACK CAME OUT OF LINE AND NEEDS TO BE REALIGNED.  THIS HAPPENED DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYING.  I HAVE SEEN MANY ACCIDENTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BY WORKING AS A VOLUNTEER FIREMEN AND AN EMT AND I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY ACCIDENTS AS MINOR AS THIS ONE WHERE THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  WHEN I SPOKE TO MITSUBISHI ABOUT THIS DEPLOYMENT THEY TOLD ME THAT THE AIR BAGS DID THERE JOB AND THE HATCH COMING OUT OF LINE IS AN EFFECT OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYING. THIS IS A PROBLEM I BELIEVE IN SUCH A MINOR ACCIDENT I HAVE A HUGE BILL DUE TO THE AIR BAGS.  THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME.  MICHAEL GREGORIO",
