It should be a recall and it should be replaced for free by Volkswagen. I don\u2019t understand why I should foot the bill for their mistake or their parts supplier\u2019s defect.

A short time later, my car began to rapidly decelerate and the engine just revved when I pushed on the gas. Fortunately, I was in the second to right lane of 5-lanes heading north and was able to coast into the far right lane. Unfortunately, there was no shoulder due to construction, so I was still blocking a lane. After turning on my flashers, I put the car in park, then turned it off. I was able to restart the engine, but could not get it into drive. I tried this multiple times with the same effect. the engine would start, rev when I pressed the gas, but would not move forward. This was a terrifying and life-threatening experience. I am so lucky to have avoided a catastrophic collision with another vehicle. As it was huge semis and other cars were passing me very closely and rapidly. After finally getting through to roadside assistance and the state patrol, I made progress in getting off the interstate and arrange a tow. The engine would go into neutral, so I was eventually able to be pushed off the interstate onto the shoulder of an exit ramp. The transmission shop owner the car was towed to could not accurately diagnose the issue but found this article: https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1126507_2013-2015-volkswagen-jetta-hybrid-recalled-for-transmission-issue. He recommended having it towed to the dealership for further diagnosis. Diagnostic screenshots are attached. There was a recall (38C4) to deal w/ the mechatronic unit, but that did not prevent the problem. The dealership states that it's a \"Transmission mechatronic accumulator/transmission internal failure.\"  I spent time on the phone w/ VW America Customer Care. They refuse to help w/ this KNOWN problem with this make, model, and year of this car. The repair estimate is $9,965.67. I have already spent $500 out of pocket for 2 diagnoses and towing.",

Their multipoint inspection didn't have any issues with the transmission on it.  VW's TDI models had a major year warranty and 13 months later that transmission also failed. My car is at the dealership and they're awaiting my decision on repairing it.  The cost to do so is $9033.55 probably more than my friend's because mine is a HYBRID.  The HYBRID system in my car has an 8 year warranty on it and I realize that the transmission is not the total hybrid system but it does connect to the braking system in hybrids.  I guess what I'm saying is that there is something inherently wrong with Volkswagen's transmissions and they need to fess up and replace them at no cost. I purchased their product in good faith believing in legendary German engineering and have been sorely disappointed.  The cost of this repair is almost 1/3 of what I paid for the car and my friend's experience has me doubting repairing it. My car is at Heritage VW in Union City, Georgia for inspection.  VW has a policy that independent repair places must get a certification on each vehicle for each repair in order to purchase genuine VW parts.  The cost of doing this is prohibitive so independent transmission facilities won't do the work. They're monopolizing the repairs to VW's.  IF MORE PEOPLE KNEW THIS I DON'T THINK VW WOULD SELL VERY MANY VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE FUTURE.  Please help if you can. Thank you.",

IT APPEARED THAT INCLINES OR ACCELERATION (EVEN THOUGH BOTH WERE GENTLE) WERE THE CULPRIT. SO I TRIED TO DRIVE THE CAR EVEN GENTLER THAN I ALREADY AM.   ON APRIL 16, HOWEVER, THE CAR ALMOST COMPLETELY  STALLED ON A BUSY 75 MPH HIGHWAY MULTIPLE TIMES. AS SUCH, I WAS DRIVING AT 20MPH IN CASE IT WAS SUDDEN ACCELERATION AND SPEED THAT WAS THE CULPRIT. I COULDN'T DRIVE ANY FASTER. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THIS MAKES FOR AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION.   SO THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY TIME I ACCELERATE FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I BITE THE BULLET AND DRIVE ON THE RIGHT LANE AT VERY SLOW SPEEDS ON THE FREEWAY, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FORM OF TRANSPORTATION.   I TAKE IT TO AAMCO ON APRIL 20TH, AND  THE MECHANICS THERE ARE ALL TERRIBLY SLICK AND SLEAZY. THEY [XXX] ME AND ESSENTIALLY WANT TO CHARGE ME $4000 TO FIX THE TORQUE CONVERTER/TRANSMISSION. WHICH IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO KBB MY CAR COULDN'T BE WORTH MORE THAN $2K.

UPON DOING RESEARCH, THERE ARE HEAPS OF FOLKS EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE AS ME. SOME ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RECALL, SOME ARE NOT. THIS IS ALL DEPENDENT ON VIN.   NOW, I CALL MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAY MY VIN ISN'T ELIGIBLE FOR RECALL. HOWEVER, I DISAGREE. THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE PLAGUING MY JETTA ARE THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE - BASICALLY THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS FAULTY. THE O-RING SEALS ARE CLEARLY LEAKING FLUID, WHICH IS IN TURN COMING IN CONTACT WITH MY HOT ENGINE. MY CAR OVERHEATS AND SMOKES, AND TOTALLY STALLS.

THIS PRESENTATION WAS UNIQUE ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. I CALLED OUR VW DEALER IN WATERTOWN, VALENTI MOTORS WHO HAS SERVICED THIS VEHICLE SINCE NEW AND ARRANGED FOR THEM TO REPAIR THIS. THEY FOUND CODES SUGGESTING A MICRO SWITCH FAILURE BUT CLAIMED THE IGNITION ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK HOUSING WHICH WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY GOOD ONLY UNTIL 100K OR 10 YEARS. OUR VW HAS 110K MILES ON IT. I CALLED VW CUSTOMER CARE AND THEY MENTIONED THAT IF THE RECALL ITEM-MICRO SWITCH WAS BEING REPAIRED OR REPLACED AGAIN, THEY WOULD COVER THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK HOUSING. ONCE THE DEALER CLAIMED THEY WOULD REPLACE THE MICRO SWITCH, VW CUSTOMER CARE UPON A SECOND CALL, RENEGED CLAIMING A WARRANTY IS CUT AND DRY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE ISSUES WHEN OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME ARE INTERRELATED NOT TO MENTION A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR MYSELF, MY FAMILY AND THOSE DRIVING AROUND THIS VEHICLE. THIS SEEMS HIGHLY UNETHICAL AT A MINIMUM FOR A MANUFACTURER TO HIDE BEHIND AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ITEM WHEN THE SAFETY OF THOSE ARE INVOLVED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS MALFUNCTIONING ITEM. OBVIOUSLY I PAID THE $500 FOR THE UNCOVERED ISSUE AS I PLAN TO HAVE MY 16 YEAR OLD DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AND NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ALLOW THIS TO GO UNFIXED. I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM THE ONLY VW OWNER WITH THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE CT STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THE BBB AND AM NOW LETTING YOU FOLKS NOW OF THIS SITUATION AS I BELIEVE IT TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.",

THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE FIRST INCIDENT WHERE THE VEHICLE HAS LOST COMPLETE POWER WHILE DRIVING IN CITY STREETS. THIS IS MY WIFE'S CAR, SHE HAD COMPLAINED TO ME OF THE CAR NOT STARTING AFTER SHE GOTTEN OFF WORK, WE TRIED TO JUMP STARTED IT AND IT STILL WOULD NOT START, SO IT HAD TO WAIT TILL I GOT OFF FROM WORK. SOON AS  I GOT TO THE VEHICLE AFTER MY SHIFT, I TRIED TO CRANK START IT AND THE VEHICLE STARTED WITH OUT HESITATION. WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY STREET, AFTER MAKING A STOP THE VEHICLE ENGINE SHUT OFF, I WAS UNAWARE SINCE THE RADIO WAS STILL PLAYING, SO MY WIFE POINTED OUT THIS HAD BEEN HAPPENING TO HER AS WELL, EVEN AFTER WE REPLACED THE BATTERY. SO I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC AND HE MENTIONED THAT THIS COULD BE AN ALTERNATOR PROBLEM, SO WE REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AS WELL, BUT THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO SHUT DOWN OR IT JUST WON'T START. I DECIDED TO CHECK THE WIRING TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE DISTRIBUTOR AND AFTER DOING THIS THE VEHICLE WILL START UP AGAIN. LAST EPISODE WAS ON 11/15/2019 AS I EXITED THE FREEWAY ON MY WAY TO WORK. WHEN I GOT HOME I REMEMBERED THAT MY WIFE HAD HANDED ME A COUPLE OF LATTERS FROM THE VW DEALER WITCH WE HAD OMITTED SINCE WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE USED IN A CAR LOT. THIS IS HOW I FOUND OUT THAT THESE LETTERS WHERE NOTICES OF THE RECALLS ON THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE. I SHARED THIS WITH A FRIEND THAT CLAIMS HE ALSO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A VW VEHICLE HE OWNED, HE EXPLAINED THAT THE PROBLEM IN HIS UNKNOWN VW MODEL, THE ELECTRICAL WIRING WAS AT FAULT.

I WAS ONLY USING SHELL GAS, SO I WAS TOLD TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND THAT WAS A TOP TIER GAS.  I TRIED CITGO AND THEY HAD THE TOP TIER STICKER ON THE TANK.  THE CAR DROVE GOOD FOR A DAY AND A HALF THEN THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN WITH ALSO THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND THE CAR STARTED TO SHAKE.

I ONLY HAVE 125K MILES AND THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE.  I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET AND I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE WITH VW JETTA FROM 2014 TO 2018 AND VW HAS NOT FIGURED OUT THE FIX FOR IT.

AND YET VW CUSTOMER CARE DOES NOT TRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE AND ONLY THING THAT THEY TELL ME IS THAT THERE IS NO EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE ON THE 2014 MODELS.    I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT THERE IS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE KEY IGNITION ON 2012/2013 VW JETTA. THERE SHOULD BE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE MODEL YEAR 2014 JETTA AS WELL BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS 2012/2013 AND 2014. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY VW IS IGNORING THIS ISSUE FOR 2014 VW JETTA. FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC SAFETY, VW NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ONGOING ISSUE AND VW NEEDS TO PROVIDE A RECALL OR AT LEAST EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR ALL THE CARS WITH THIS WELL KNOWN ISSUE.    VW CUSTOMER CARE REGION MANAGER IS EXTREMELY SLOW IN RESPONDING TO THIS ISSUE. IT'S BEEN A WEEK AND STILL, THERE IS NO ANSWER ON WHETHER THEY WILL FIX THIS ISSUE OR NOT.

THIS PAST WEEKEND (AUGUST 13, 2016), WHILE AT A ROUTINE PIT STOP FOR GAS MY VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT.  I HAD PARKED AT THE GAS STATION RIGHT OFF THE HIGHWAY.

THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE BACK IN 2013 WHEN THE VW JETTA WENT ON THE MARKET, BUT THE RECALL DID NOT INVOLVE MY VIN.  THE RECALL WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO ME AT THE TIME I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, NOR WAS I EVER NOTIFIED OF IT BEING A POTENTIAL ISSUE.  I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY WHEN I WAS LEFT STRANDED 70 MILES FROM HOME AND 45 MILES FROM THE NEAREST VW DEALERSHIP.

WE COULD NOT USE THE SEAT BELT THE WAY THAT IT WAS SO HE SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE TO GET HOME. ...UPDATED 08/31/16 *BF    WE OBSERVED THE SEAT BELT AND NOTED THAT IT WAS SEVERELY FRAYED APPROX  OF AN INCH INTO THE EDGE OF THE SEAT BELT. THE NYLON WEBBING WAS BUNCHING UP AND NOT ALLOWING THE BUCKLE TO SLIDE DOWN THE SEAT BELT. MY FIRST ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THE SEAT BELT GOT SLAMMED IN THE DOOR AND MAY HAVE CUT IT ALLOWING THE SEAT BELT TO START TO FRAY. THINKING THIS WAS THE CASE WE DECIDED TO TRIM THE FRAYED FIBERS FROM THE BELT AND USE AN IRON TO SEAL THE AREA BY HEATING IT. THIS WORKED WELL AND ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SEAT BELT BUT UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION WE NOTICED THAT THE FRAYED AREA WAS EXACTLY WHERE THE BELT STOPS IN THE OPENING IN THE REAR DASH, EXACTLY!. WE LOOKED AT THE OTHER TWO BELTS, REAR CENTER, AND REAR DRIVERS SIDE AND NOTICED THE SAME FRAYING OCCURRING IN VARYING DEGREES OF DAMAGE, IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATIONS, RIGHT WHERE THE SEAT BELT STOPS IN THE OPENING IN THE REAR DASH, THE EXACT SAME SPOT!..I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, THELEN IN BAYCITY, MI TO ASK THEM TO LOOK AT THE SEAT BELTS WHILE THE CAR WAS IN FOR ITS 30,000 MILE SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE.

I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP WHEN THE ENGINE TURNED OFF. I TURNED OFF MY CAR AND RESTARTED IT AND THE ENGINE WAS SHAKING BADLY (FROM SIDE TO SIDE) AND THE MORE I DROVE THE CAR THE MORE LIGHTS STARTED TURNING ON. I WAS STUCK IN MAJOR HOLIDAY TRAFFIC AND ALMOST GOT HIT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND GOT HONKED AT MULTIPLE TIMES BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO KEEP UP IN TRAFFIC DUE TO THE VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE VEHICLE. GOING ABOVE 25 MILES AN HOUR CAUSED THE CAR TO MAKE A LOUD NOISE AND SHAKE EVEN MORE VIGOROUSLY, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE AND DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. THE FIRST LIGHTS TO TURN ON INCLUDED THE EPC, OIL LIGHT (ENGINE LOW OIL) AND ENGINE (EMISSION CONTROL LIGHT). HOWEVER, AS I DROVE THE CAR MORE, TO PULL OVER TO SAFETY BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO PULL OVER AT THE CURRENT PLACE I BROKE DOWN, THE MORE LIGHTS STARTED TO TURN ON SUCH AS THE TIRE PRESSURE SYSTEM. I HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER WHO SAID 3 OF MY 4 IGNITION COILS WERE MISFIRING. I GOT THE CAR BACK ON DECEMBER 1, 2015 AND MY CAR BROKE DOWN AGAIN ON DECEMBER 4, 2015, WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. IT WAS BROUGHT BACK INTO A DIFFERENT DEALER DUE TO BREAKING DOWN IN A DIFFERENT AREA. THE IGNITION COILS HAVE FAILED AGAIN, CAUSING MY ENGINE TO SHUT DOWN AND PUTTING ME IN A VULNERABLE PLACE. I AM LUCKY THAT MY ENGINE FAILED ON A CITY STREET THE SECOND TIME COMPARED TO A BUSY HIGHWAY BUT THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE AND I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE, BECAUSE THE FIRST BREAK DOWN ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY WAS NOT ONLY SCARY BUT A LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION.",

FILLED REMAINDER (APPROX. 1/4 TANK, 3.5 GALLONS) WITH ULSD AUTO DIESEL FUEL AT A SERVICE STATION IN PORTAGE COUNTY, OH.    I NOTICED AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE LOSS OF APPROX. 4 MPG IN FUEL ECONOMY.    AFTER RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ON VARIOUS VOLKSWAGEN TDI/DIESEL INTERNET DISCUSSION FORUMS (IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS CHEVY AND/OR FORD DIESEL PICKUP TRUCK INTERNET DISCUSSION FORUMS), THE SYMPTOMS SEEMED TO COINCIDE WITH DAMAGE TO THE BOSCH CP4 HPFP (HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP).  SYMPTOMS INCLUDE:    -- LOSS OF FUEL ECONOMY.  -- MINOR HESITATION EVEN ON SMOOTH, LEVEL ROADS THAT GETS WORSE OVER TIME.  -- PRESENCE OF METAL \"FLAKES\" OR \"SHAVINGS\" IN THE FUEL FILTER CANISTER AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FUEL DELIVERY/RETURN SYSTEM. --    I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE POINT OF PURCHASE (AN OFFICIAL VOLKSWAGEN DEALER), AND REQUESTED THEY PROVIDE ME WITH A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE FUEL FILTER AND FUEL FILTER CANISTER.    THIS INSPECTION CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF NAKED-EYE-VISIBLE CONTAMINATING PARTICLES (SUSPECTED TO BE ALUMINUM METAL \"FLAKES\" OR \"SHAVINGS\") IN THE FUEL FILTER CANISTER, AND POSSIBLY OTHER PARTS OF THE FUEL DELIVERY/RETURN SYSTEM.    DUE TO THE FUEL DELIVERY/RETURN SYSTEM DESIGN, THESE METAL \"FLAKES\" OR \"SHAVINGS\" CAN BE RE-INTRODUCED INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP WITHOUT BEING TRAPPED BY THE FUEL FILTER, CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE HPFP AND CASCADING CONTAMINATION (GENERATION OF ADDITIONAL METAL \"FLAKES\" OR \"SHAVINGS\").    ONCE FUEL FLOW THROUGH THE HPFP, FUEL ACCUMULATOR RAIL, AND INJECTORS BECOMES SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTED BY CONTAMINANTS, THE HPFP CAN FAIL CATASTROPHICALLY, RESULTING IN A SUDDEN LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.  THIS, IN TURN, CAN LEAD TO A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF POWER STEERING.    CASE OPENED WITH VW CUSTOMER CARE.  *TR",
