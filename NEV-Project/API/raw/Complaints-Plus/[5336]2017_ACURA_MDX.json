With the heavy traffic on the interstate, this scenario could have been catastrophic as there is currently construction and no place to pull over for emergencies.  The vehicle was towed to Hubler Acura in Greenwood IN where they performed a diagnostic test and no known issues were found on their diagnostic computer.  However, the issue is not happening on a computer at the dealer, the issue occurred on the interstate while traveling 70mph.  I have read several message boards where the users have posted similar experiences about losing power when accelerating in their 2017 MDX.  The dealerships seem to offer a transmission fluid change or a computer reset as a solution.  I have previously had the same acceleration issue and had these two items already completed within the past 90 days and neither issue resolved the problem, which further led to the most recent interstate incident.  From my online research, Honda is either unwilling or unable to diagnose this common transmission problem and they need to be held accountable for their inaction.  This issue needs to be addressed before it creates a scenario with fatalities.",

I could not put it in Park or it would roll backwards so I put on my hazard lights and kept my foot on the brake. I was almost rear ended several times as it was 9:30pm and no lights on the freeway in the area I was at and no place to get out and find a safe spot as my car would have rolled backwards as it would not come out of Neutral and at that spot in the freeway there is only cement walls. I was able to get the Calif. Highway Patrol to get me a tow company that could tow my car after I called 911. AAA which I have said it would be 90 minutes. I would have been killed before that. The tow truck driver had to tow my car to the Hopkins Acura dealership in Fairfield, CA where I had just had it serviced the Thursday and Friday before on March 17 and 18 for the car's 100,000 maintenance work. The Hopkins Acura said they test drove it after the maintenance work which cost me $3500.00 but my speedometer showed they only put 1.5 miles on my car so they did not test drive it far. The dealership said they do not touch the transmission during the big maintenance but this car was driving fine and for this transmission to just stop and freeze is so dangerous. The dealership says they will fix the transmission as they spoke to two different companies they work with but they want me to pay $600.00 of the repair which I do not think is fair.",

I was in passing lane and a truck in middle lane \u2026.. this made no sense.  4th: location at intersection Truck turned left across and in front of me, brakes engaged and stopped my car, only to find out a low trailer was being towed.  Brakes did help prevent an accident. KUDOS earned here!!!! 5th: location back road speed less than 40mph Vehicle in front of me turning right Again my brakes engaged! Again I used the gas hoping the brakes would disengage. I dont know if it helped or not. Now I ONLY use the cruise control on highways.",

COULD IT MOLD OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE REAR ELECTRIC LIGHTING COMPONENTS? HOW DOES THE LIFT GATE TRUNK DOOR MISALIGN IF IT WASN'T IN AN ACCIDENT? IF THE LIFT GATE TRUNK DOOR IS MISALIGNED, WHY WAS THIS SUV SOLD AS A CPO & NOT USED? I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE SUV.

ONE OF MY MAJOR CONCERNS IS THE SIGNIFICANT \"LURCHING\" I GET WHEN PARKING ON A SLOPE, SHIFTING TO \"PARK\" AND THEN TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE.  ON SNOW OR ICE, THE CAR COULD EASILY SLIDE SOME DISTANCE.  I SIMILAR LURCHING ALSO FREQUENTLY OCCURS WHEN SHIFTING INTO DRIVE OR REVERSE WHEN ON A SLOPE AND THEN STARTING TO ACCELERATE.  MY SECOND MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT WHEN I DOWNSHIFT ON A DOWN-SLOPE IN LIEU OF BRAKING, THE CAR ACTUALLY FIRST SPEEDS SIGNIFICANTLY UP AFTER DOWNSHIFTING AND DOES NOT SLOW DOWN AS IT SHOULD.  I DO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DRIVING IN MOUNTAINS WHERE DOWN-SHIFTING IS SAFER THAN BRAKING AND THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  LASTLY, THE CAR HESITATES AT TIMES WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AT LEAST TWICE AND AM TOLD THAT THESE ISSUES ARE JUST THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAR.",

EXPERIENCING ROUGH SHIFTING, ESPECIALLY IN LOW GEARS ON ALL PAVED ROADS. DANGEROUS WHEN TRYING TO MERGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY DUE TO EXTREMELY SLOW ACCELERATION.  SOMETIMES WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO STOP, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATES. WHEN I TRY TO MAKE A LEFT TURN AGAINST ONCOMING TRAFFIC, THE VEHICLE HESITATES AND COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.   ALL DRIVING TAKES PLACES ON CITY STREETS, HIGHWAYS AND PAVED ROADWAYS.  ON ONE OCCASION, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO REVERSE FROM A PARKED POSITION.
