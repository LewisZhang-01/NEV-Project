ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD A BLAST. FIRST I THOUGHT SOMEONE SHOT THE CAR, THEN THOUGHT MUST HAVE BLOWN A TIRE, BUT IT WAS STEERING FINE. I HEARD AIR AND LOOKED UP AT THE SUNROOF AND IT HAD SHATTERED AND EXPLODED, BIG CHUNK HAD BLOWN OUT. MORE LITTLE PIECES WERE BLOWING OUT SO I SHUT THE COVER. TOOK A PICTURE OF MY DISPLAY SHOWING TEMP, SPEED ETC. WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO, I WAS 30 MILES FROM TOWN, SO I DROVE TO GAS STATION FOR GAS, AND TOOK PICTURES. NEXT MORNING CALLED TOYOTA AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED. HE MADE ME AN APPT. FOR LATER THAT DAY. I SAID IT SHOULD BE NO COST TO ME AS IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT IN THE SUNROOF. HE SAID WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF A ROCK HIT IT OR SOMETHING. I SAID \"NO ROCK HIT IT, IT JUST EXPLODED FOR NO REASON\". WENT TO APPT AND SERVICE GUY HAD ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, THEY SENT OUT MAINTENANCE MANAGER. SHE TRIED TO TELL ME A ROCK MUST HAVE HIT IT, I ARGUED THAT NOTHING HIT IT, IT JUST EXPLODED. THEN SERVICE DIRECTOR CAME OUT, HE SAID THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVE WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER MY INSURANCE COMPREHENSIVE FOR GLASS REPAIR. I SAID SURE WITH A $500 DEDUCTIBLE THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY. HE SAID WELL THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO. THEY WROTE UP A REPAIR QUOTE AND GAVE THAT TO ME. THEN A COUPLE GUYS COVERED THE SUNROOF WITH STICKY PLASTIC TO KEEP THE RAIN AND OTHER STUFF OUT. OTHER THAN THAT THEY WERE NO HELP, THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING, WHICH I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE, SO WHEN I GOT HOME I RESEARCHED EXPLODING SUNROOFS AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS. I FEEL IT IS A DEFECTIVE SUNROOF AND TOYOTA SHOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.",

I HAD RENTED A TOYOTA COROLLA WHILE THE DEALERSHIP INVESTIGATED THE PROBLEM ALONG WITH ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. THE REPORT CAME BACK THAT THE CAR OPERATED NORMALLY. I THEN ASKED TO DO A \"TEST DRIVE\" WITH THE CHIEF MECHANIC. WE WENT OUT IN THE COROLLA FIRST TO A FLAT LEVEL LOCATION IN THE PARKING LOT. AFTER STOPPING THE CAR I RELEASED THE BRAKE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW DOCILE THE CAR REACTED WHEN THE BRAKE WAS RELEASED. WE THEN GOT INTO MY RAV 4 AND RETURNED TO THE SAME LOCATION. I REPEATED THE PROCESS AND NOTED WITH THE MECHANIC HOW MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE THE RAV REACTED WHEN THE BRAKE WAS RELEASED. MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE IDLE IS SET TOO HIGH WHICH CAUSES THIS PROBLEM OF \"CREEPING\" WHILE STOPPED. THE MECHANIC AGREED THAT IT APPEARED MORE AGGRESSIVE BUT WANTED TO DO FURTHER TESTING, SO ON 8/28/2017 I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE MECHANIC TEST DROVE ANOTHER RAV 4 AND DID A TIME TEST ON HOW FAST IT WENT FROM POINT A TO POINT B. HE REPEATED THE PROCESS WITH MY CAR. HIS REPORT STATED THAT BOTH RAV 'S PERFORMED THE SAME.  UNSATISFIED WITH THE TESTING DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE ON 8/30/207 AND STATED MY CONCERN. I WAS TOLD THAT THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT ADJUST THE IDLE ON THE CAR BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE CAR WAS DESIGNED AND TO CHANGE IT WOULD VOID THE WARRANTY. SO TOYOTA ENGINEERED INTO THE RAV 4 A PROBLEMATIC IDLE SPEED?  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND ONE DAY I WILL REAR END SOMEONE.

VEHICLE INVOLVED WAS A SIX MONTH OLD 2016 TOYOTA RAV4 WITH 5300 MILES.  INCIDENT OCCURRED IN SOUTHBOUND LANES OF   I-65 BETWEEN LAFAYETTE AND LEBANON, IN. WHILE MOVING AT 60 MPH IN A VERY HEAVY RAINSTORM.      FORTUNATELY, I WAS IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE AND WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD WITHOUT BEING STRUCK BY FOLLOWING TRAFFIC AND HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A TOYOTA DEALER IN AVON, IN.    AFTER EXAMINING MY VEHICLE THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS WATER IN MY ENGINE WHICH WAS NOT COVERED BY MY WARRANTY.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT I HAD BEEN DRIVING THROUGH DEEP STANDING WATER.  WHEN TOLD THAT I WAS DRIVING ON INTERSTATE, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEN IT WAS \"AN ACT OF  GOD\" AND STILL WAS NOT COVERED.    SINCE DEALING WITH REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE, AT A COST OF $10,000, I HAVE HAD THE CAR EXAMINED BY A MECHANICAL ENGINEER WHO IS OF THE OPINION THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED DUE TO THE RE-DESIGN OF THE AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM.  AIR IS INDUCTED AT LEFT FRONT WHEEL AND, WITH HEAVY RAIN,  WATER SPLASHING OFF ROAD IS FORCED THRU AIR FILTER. WATER SHOULD NOT REACH THE AIR FILTER BUT, SINCE THIS IS THE ONLY AVENUE FOR ENTRANCE TO THE ENGINE WITHOUT SUBMERSION, IT OBVIOUSLY DID.  ONCE FILTER IS SATURATED THERE ARE NO BAFFLES OR SWALES TO PREVENT WATER FROM RUNNING DIRECTLY   INTO THE INTAKE OF THE ENGINE.    TOYOTA ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS INCIDENT EITHER FINANCIALLY OR FOR SAFETY CONCERNS.  THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS JUST DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE.  I HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE IN THAT IKNOW THAT THIS IS TRUE.  I FEEL EXTREMELY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AVOIDED A CRASH AT THIS SPEED AND IN THESE CONDITIONS.  I HOPE THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE SERIOUS INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT THIS DESIGN FLAW.  *TR",
