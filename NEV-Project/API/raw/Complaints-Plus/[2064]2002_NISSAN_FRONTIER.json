I TOLD MR. KIRK THAT IN THE PAST I HAVE TAKEN MY TRUCK TO BROWS FAIRFAX NISSAN. I TOOK MY TRUCK TO BROWNS FAIRFAX NISSAN ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2006 AND PICKED UP A RENTAL CAR. I RECEIVED A CALL THAT EVENING FROM CHARTER WELLS, THEY COULD NOT FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND WOULD HAVE TO KEEP IT OVER NIGHT. ON SEPTEMBER 26 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM CHARTER WELLS, HE SAID THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS REPLACED (RECALL ISSUE), I ASK HIM DID THAT TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT HE SAID NO BUT I WOULD NEED MY TRANSMISSION FLUSHED BECAUSE IT IS DIRTY. AFTER THINKING ABOUT THE FUEL SENDING UNIT BEING REPLACED AND THAT DID NOT TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE, I THOUGHT TO GO BACK TO MY MECHANIC FOR HIS ADVICE. I DID NOT HAVE THE TRANSMISSION FLUSHED. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2006 I WENT TO MY MECHANIC AND INFORMED HIM OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON MY TRUCK FROM BROWNS FAIRFAX NISSAN AND THE ISSUE WITH THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT.     OIL CHANGED AND TIRES BALANCED/ROTATED ISSUE HE INFORMED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS GOING BAD AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE NISSANS WARRANTY.  HE ALSO CHECKED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID TO SEE IF IT WAS DIRTY AND IT WASN'T.    *JB",

THIS SEEMS LIKE EXCESSIVE AND PREMATURE BRAKE FAILURE.  I HAVE VISTITED SEVERAL OWNER WEBSITES AND HAVE SEEN A MULTITUDE OF STORIES REGARDING EARLY BRAKE WEAR ON THE 2002 ALTIMA.  THIS VEJICLE HAS ALSO HAD 5 SAFETY RECALL IN THE LAST 2 YEARS. NISSAN CLAIMS THAT THIS IS \"NORMAL\" BRAKE WEAR.  I THINK IT'S A POTENTIAL SAFTEY HAZARD.   THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPAIRED AT A COST OF $900.   I AM NOT A \"HARD\" DRIVER AND ALL VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED IN THE PAST HAVE NOT NEEDED BRAKES TILL 50-60000 MILES.  THIS SEEMS LIKE EITHER A DESIGN FLAW OR FAULTY PARTS OR BOTH.  *AK",

SINCE IT WAS NEW IT HAS A SOFT PEDAL THAT REQUIRES VARIED PRESSURES,  DESPITE SIMILAR CONDITIONS. TO BRING IT TO A STOP AND OR SLOW IT DOWN. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO NISSAN AND THE DEALER. THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THIS IS THE WAY \"THEY ARE\" AND THAT THEY HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN DO BUT THIS IS ALL THEY CAN DO TO THE SYSTEM. NISSSAN HEADQUARTERS WANT ME TO, AND I AM, TAKE IT TO ANOTHER DEALER TO SEE IF IT IS NORMAL. MY FEELING IS THAT IT IS \"NORMAL FOR THE VEHICLE\" BUT NOT SAFE NOR ACCEPTABLE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY WILL FIX A \"NORMAL' VEHICLE, THOUGH IT DOES NOT MEET A SAFE STANDARD FOR STOPPING, COMPARED TO THE MANY CARS THAT I HAVE OWNED IN THE PAST. I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT WILL NOT STOP. I AM STATING THAT IT IS NOT CONSISTENT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WILL NOT STOP IN MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDITIONS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS LITTLE FEEL AND/OR CONTROL AND THIS IS AN ACCIDENT HAZZARD. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH ANOTHER NISSAN DEALER NEXT TUESDAY TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY THING THAT CAN BE REPAIRED OR IF THIS IS \"NORMAL\". I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM,THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE LARGER ROTORS AND CALIPERS AND A REDESIGN OF THE MASTER CYLINDER. INFACT, I WAS TOLD LAST TIME I WAS THERE, BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN REDESIGNED FOR THE NEW MODEL YEAR. THIS IS NOT MY RATIONALE FOR COMPLAINING, AS I WAS TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THIS NEW DESIGN, HOWEVER I DO APPLAUD THEIR REENGINEERING. *AK",

I PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE TRUCK OFF I MADE SURE THAT THERE WAS GAS, AND STARTED THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. IT SEEMED TO RUN AT ABOUT THE CORRECT RPM SO I TOOK IT DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER. THEY HAD IT FOR A WEEK, AND ULTIMATELY SAID THAT IT WAS A BAD OXYGEN SENSOR (THE VEHICLE IS SUPERCHARGED) THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. I AM NOT TOO CONFIDENT IN THAT EXPLANATION. GOD WILLING, THE PROBLEM IS FIXED. THE TRUCK WAS ONLY 3 WEEKS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.*AK",
