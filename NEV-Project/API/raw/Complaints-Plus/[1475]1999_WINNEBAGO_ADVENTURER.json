MY SPECIFIC MODEL IS THE M34VP, THE THIRTY-FOUR FOOT LONG DIESEL PUSHER.     THE COACH'S ONBOARD ELECTRICAL GENERATOR SET (GENSET) IS FUELED WITH LIQUID PROPANE FROM AN ONBOARD TANK.  THE TANK HAS A SHUTOFF VALVE ON THE TANK TO STOP THE FLOW OF LIQUID PROPANE TO THE GENSET, BUT NO SHUTOFF VALVE NEAR THE GENSET.  THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE NEAR THE GENSET PRODUCES A PROBLEM WHEN THE TANK VALVE HAS BEEN OPENED, CHARGING THE 25 FEET OF HALF-INCH PIPE BETWEEN THE TANK AND THE GENSET WITH LIQUID PROPANE, AND THE GENSET WILL NOT START AND RUN TO CONSUME THE FUEL IN THE SUPPLY LINE.  IN THAT INSTANCE, THE FUEL IN THE LINE CANNOT BE EVACUATED TO ALLOW THE GENSET TO BE SAFELY REMOVED FROM THE COACH FOR REPAIRS.    IN OR ABOUT MARCH OR APRIL OF 2000, THE GENSET ON MY COACH WOULDN'T START AND HAD TO BE REMOVED FRO REPAIRS.  THE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO ISOLATE THE GENSET FROM THE SUPPLY LINE AND THE FULL CONTENTS OF THE LINE CAUSED A VERY LARGE CLOUD OF PROPANE GAS TO BE RELEASED, POSING AN IMMEDIATE AND SERIOUS POTENTIAL FOR MASSIVE FIRE AND EXPLOSION.    I CONTACTED WINNEBAGO AND THEY REFUSED ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND WOULD NOT INSTALL THE APPLIANCE SHUTOFF VALVE AS REQUESTED.  THERE ARE HUNDREDS, AND PERHAPS THOUSANDS, OF WINNEBAGO AND ITASCA COACHES AND RV'S THAT HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM.

SECONDLY, A SAFETY HAZARD EXIST IN THAT IF YOU REMOVE THE GAS CAP AFTER TANK HAS PRESSURIZED DURING OPERATION, THE BACK PRESSURE WILL CAUSE GAS AND FUMES TO ESCAPE FROM FILL LINE INTO FACE. THIS DESIGN FLAW IS A HEALTH SAFETY AND FIRE HAZARD. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BAD DESIGN OF THE GAS FUEL FILLER LINE BUT WILL NOT ACCEPT OWNERSHIP FOR THE DESIGN FLAW NOR THE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO RECTIFY. THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND 1999 CHASSIS PRODUCED BY THE FORD MOTOR CO. THESE CHASSIS ARE  OR WERE USED FOR MOTOR HOME OTHER THAN WINNEBAGO AS WELL AS WINNEBAGO. WINNEBAGO SAYS FORD KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM BUT REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. MY UNDERSTANDING WINNEBAGO IS TESTING A DESIGN THAT WILL CORRECT THE PROBLEM. MAYBE. AT THIS POINT FORD NOR WINNEBAGO PLAN NO RECALL. THERE APPEARS IN MY OPINION AN EFFORT TO BURY THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN SEEKING A SOLUTION. WHEN I PURCHASED THE RV NO ONE AT LAMESA RV OR WINNEBAGO INFORMED ME OF THE INHERENT DESIGN FLAW THEREBY MASKING A MATERIAL FACT THAT IF KNOWN WOULD HAVE GREATLY AFFECTED MY DECISION TO PURCHASE THE WINNEBAGO.",
