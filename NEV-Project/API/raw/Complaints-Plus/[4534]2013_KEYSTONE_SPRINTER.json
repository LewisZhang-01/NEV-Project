FOR WHATEVER REASON AN EIGHT FOOT (APPROX) PIECE OF TWO INCH 16 GAUGE (THIN) STEEL SQUARE TUBING HAS BEEN WELDED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME MEMBER ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  THE SPRING HANGERS (FRONT RIGHT AND LEFT AND REAR RIGHT AND LEFT AND BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT CENTER) ARE THEN WELDED TO THIS THIN SQUARE TUBING NOT THE FRAME. THE HANGERS ARE OF MUCH THICKER MATERIAL.    WHAT I KNOW CAN AND DID HAPPEN WAS THAT THE RIGHT SIDE REAR SPRING HANGER TORE LOOSE FROM THIS HAPHAZARD CONFIGERATION.  THIS RESULTED IN THE RIGHT SIDE REAR TIRE AND WHEEL BEING NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE RV.  THIS ALLOWED THAT TIRE TO TURN SIDEWAYS TO DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.  RESULT WAS NEAR LOSS OF CONTROL OF TOW VEHICLE AND DAMAGE TO VARIOUS OTHER PARTS OF THE RV.   THE VEHICLE WAS NOT MOVABLE OR EVEN TOWABLE UNTIL THE FAILED SPRING HANGER SUPPORT WAS WELDED BACK IN PLACE (TO THE SAME THIN TUBE THAT HAD ALREADY FAILED)    THIS FAILURE OCCURRED TO ME YESTERDAY AM HAS IT WAS BEING TOWED SOUTH ON US 67 AT APPROX 55 MPH",
