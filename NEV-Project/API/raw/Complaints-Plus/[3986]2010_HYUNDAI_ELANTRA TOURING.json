        "summary": "Traveling 25-30 MPH on a gravel road, car shuddered and seemed to tilt sightly to the left. At the same time a loud grinding noise was heard and steering felt funny. On stopping and exiting the car, I saw the left rear wheel was toed to the left, and leaning so that the top of the tire was extended beyond the fender arch. Looking beneath the car, I could see the left rear control arm had torn loose from it's pivot point near the center of the uni-body, due to corrosion. The wheel hub was attached to the car solely by the torsion bar, brake line, and strut. The car had passed a state safety inspection exactly one year previous, and has approximately 115K miles, primarily in Maine. There was NO warning before the failure, such as sloppy steering or unstable handling.     The gravel road where the failure occurred leads to my vacation cabin. To get there and return home I must cross a mountain pass which is steep and winding both ways, with a speed limit of 50MPH. One side has sheer drop offs, and the other has solid rock ledge. If the failure had happened in this 10 mile stretch, the results could very well have been deadly.        Someone may have offered to repair the corrosion damage to the uni-body, but I could never feel comfortable driving the car again. There was no damage to anything but the vehicle itself, so no police report was made. The extremely rural area where the failure occurred made it impractical to get the car to a Hyundai dealer. I junked the car with Dubois Towing and Salvage, 438 River Rd, Mexico, Maine, 04257 (207-364-7273).",

        "summary": "I have a significant defect and safety issue with my 2010 Hyundai Elantra that should be recalled by Hyundai. There seems to be a problem with the automatic gear shifter. The first issue is intermittent where the car does not turn on or even make a clicking noise when I try to turn the key in the ignition. This might make you think the battery is dead, but that is not the case. After a while of turning the car on and off, the car will eventually start. The second issue is that the gear shifter gets stuck and will not shift from one position to another. After much difficulty in getting it unstuck and shifting, the third and most significant problem is that the indicator as to which gear the car is in is not reflecting the actual gear that the car is in. This presents a real safety issue as the indicator will say that the car is in Park, but the car will roll like it is in neutral so the only way to get this to stop is to put on the emergency break while parked.  Shifting into a position that you think you\u2019re in, but not actually in, can result in hitting a pedestrian or another car. In rare instances, the car will actually shift into the correct position indicated by the gear shifter while it is in Park. You can find numerous results if you do a google search on the internet for the issues I\u2019ve described above in Hyundai cars. Since the gear shifter is not working properly and is getting stuck, I feel this presents a significant safety issue should I need to get out of the way quickly in either a Drive or Reverse position or if I am expecting to be in a Park position and the car keeps moving.",

I HAD TO OPEN THE FRONT DRIVER DOOR AND HOP IN THE CAR WHILE IT WAS MOVING SO I COULD HIT THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP THE CAR. AFTER THIS I WENT TO A LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER AND TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THE ISSUE THE TOLD ME THEY HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE AND HAD TO REPLACE TRANSMISSIONS IN THE CARS AFFECTED. I BOUGHT MINE FROM A USED CAR LOT ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO I AM TAKING IT BACK AND THEY ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE CAR, HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE A RECALL ISSED SO I CAN TAKE THIS CAR TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED SO I KNOW FOR SURE THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPPEN AGAIN..

THIS IS VERY UNSAFE AND A GOOGLE SEARCH WILL CONFIRM THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THESE CARS YEARS 2007 TILL 2010.
