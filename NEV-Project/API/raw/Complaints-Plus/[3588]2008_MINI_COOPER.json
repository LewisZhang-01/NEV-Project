ON APRIL 28, 2016, I TOOK MY CAR TO A MINI COOPER DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE ISSUE DIAGNOSED (AT A COST OF $53.95).  THE DIAGNOSIS STATES \"FAULT PASSENGER SIDE SEAT MAT SENSOR\" (INVOICE COPY ATTACHED).   I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MY VEHICLE THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR THE APRIL 2015 AIR-BAG RECALL EXCEPT IT IS A HARDTOP INSTEAD OF A CONVERTIBLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  TO FIX THIS ITEM WILL BE OVER 1300.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 14,000 MILES ON IT.  DUE TO THE COST, AT THIS POINT I DO NOT PLAN ON HAVING IT FIXED AND WILL SAY MY PRAYERS EVERY TIME I TRAVEL WITH A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE.",

THEY INSTALLED ANOTHER HEAT SHIELD ON 2/21/14 OVER TOP OF THE OIL LINE TO PREVENT THE HEAT FROM BURNING UP THE O-RING  THAT IS ALREADY BAD. NOW THEY INFORM ME THAT SINCE THE HEAT SHIELDS ARE IN PLACE I NEED TO PAY TO HAVE THE OIL LINE REPLACED WHICH COST $805.00.

THIS IS A BAD SAFETY PROBLEM  UNDER THE HOOD BECAUSE WHEN THE OIL GOES TO LEAKING ON THE TURBO CHARGER WHICH IS REALLY HOTTER THAT THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD IT CAUSES EXCESSIVE SMOKE FROM COMING OUT OF UNDER THE HOOD AND COULD CAUSE A LARGE FIRE FUELED BY MOTOR OIL PUMPING OUT ON TOP OF TURBO CHARGER. ALLOWING THE DEALERSHIPS TO PUT SHIELDS OVER TOP OF THE BAD OIL LINE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED.

LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND THE TURBO WAS COVERED WITH OIL. BACK TO THE DEALER. THEY CAN FIX IT FOR 1200.00 IT IS THE TURBO OIL FEED SUPPLY AND RETURN LINE. ALSO THE OIL DETERIORATED THE AIR INTAKE LINE AND CAUSED IT TO DEFORM SO THAT IT NO LONGER WILL STAY ON THE TURBO INTAKE.

RATHER THAN POP THE HOOD, I FIRST RAN TO THE TRUNK AND GRABBED A REFLECTOR (WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW HERE) AND RAN 20-25 FEET BEHIND THE CAR TO PLACE IT ON THE GROUND, TO WARN ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  NO SOONER HAD I DONE THIS, WHEN I HEAD AN EXPLOSION, QUICKLY TURNED AROUND AND SAW THAT THE ENTIRE FRONT HALF OF THE MINI WAS NOW ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  I COULD DO NOTHING BUT SIT AND WATCH, AS WITHIN MOMENTS THE FIRE HAD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE CAR AND SOON BECAME AN COMPLETE FIREBALL.    GERMAN POLICE AND FIRE OFFICIALS SHOWED UP 15-20 MINUTES LATER AND BY THE TIME THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED, ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS A CHARRED FRAME OF METAL.    FORTUNATELY I WAS NOT PHYSICALLY HURT BY THE EXPLOSION OR THE FIRE.  HOWEVER, MENTALLY I HAVE REPLAYED THE EXPERIENCE A HUNDRED TIMES AND EACH TIME I ASK MYSELF, WHAT IF I HAD POPPED THE HOOD FIRST, OR WHAT IF I HAD TAKEN EVEN AN EXTRA 30 SECONDS IN PULLING THE CAR OVER?  THINKING ABOUT IT JUST MAKES MY BLOOD RUN COLD AND FEELS ME WITH DREAD.  WE PURCHASED THE CAR IN '08 IN VIRGINIA AND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH IT AND IT WAS EVEN IN THE SHOP EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHERE THE FLUIDS WERE ALL TOPPED OFF AND EVERYTHING WAS TOLD TO BE IN EXCELLENT RUNNING CONDITION.  *TR",

THIS IS BOTH A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE INSTRUMENTATION IS WRONG, AS WELL AS A FRAUD ISSUE AS THE CAR LOSES VALUE BECAUSE OF THE PERCEIVED ADDITIONAL MILES DRIVEN AND WOULD BE OUT OF WARRANTY SOONER BECAUSE OF THE PERCEIVED MILEAGE AMOUNT. ALSO, IF THIS WERE A LEASE AND I WENT OVER THE AMOUNT ALLOTTED BY SAID LEASE, MINI WOULD PENALIZE THE DRIVE PER THE MILEAGE. BMW/MINI HAS TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND SAY ITS NOT A PROBLEM AS THEY GIVE ALOT OF LEEWAY FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE SPEEDOMETER. *TR",
