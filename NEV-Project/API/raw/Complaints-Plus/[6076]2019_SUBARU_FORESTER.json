That seemed to fix it.  It's now March 2021. Yesterday, I walked outside to find my car battery dead again! I jumped it, and drove it around to allow the battery to recharge.

A coffee cup at the drive through collapsed spilling coffee.  Through a sequence of moves I found myself rolling out of the drive up line, across the parking lot right towards the sidewalk and highway on the other side. The engine was off, the brakes would not function, I could not move the shift lever and the ignition key would not re-start the car!  I had no control or ability to change anything in the span of 10 seconds.  Only the landscaped run of bushes at the edge of the parking lot saved us.  At the drive up window the car was in neutral.  I could not change the position of the shifter if I had my foot on the break as we were rolling. Nor could I restart the engine with  my foot off the break and rolling.  At the end of the roll when stopped I think the shift lever was in the reverses R position.  Despite several tries I could not operate the emergency break.  There were no warnings from the smart car system.  I was able to test out a few sequences that would cause the same circumstances.  I did not go to the dealer yet, there were no police involved or damage done other than hot coffee on me and my front seat.   Engineers designing \"smarts\" in new vehicles have over-engineered the controls creating a major overall hazard because the systems are too complicated.  More training for new car owners is not a solution.  Up until the 21st century cars had a true emergency break that could be operated by hand or foot to apply the rear emergency brakes.  Now they are all operated electronically with a button, which is not available unless the car is running.  This is not just a problem with our car.  It is a problem with most autos built today, domestic and foreign.   Somewhere along the line we lost our focus on what an emergency brake is for.",

It was replaced by safelite in July 2020 (limited staff due to COVID). In April of 2021 my windshield was again struck by a rock from the highway and, while it started as less than 4 inches in length, quickly grew to over 6 inches within a matter of days. Since this would be the second time replacing my windshield and I still needed to commute 30 minutes to work via the highway for another couple months, I withheld reaching out to Safelite to get my windshield replaced until I could move residence and not have to take the highway every day. It was replaced in July of 2021. This ended up being the wise decision, as between April 2021 and July 2021 the windshield sustained two more cracks, for a total of 3 well over 6 inches each. Yesterday, March 10, 2022 my windshield was once again struck. This time it looks like if it were hit with a baseball bat, but I was on the highway, so it may have been a bird. I am aware of a current lawsuit against Subaru for weak windshields on 2017-2020 vehicles, which my 2019 Forester falls into, so I can't help but wonder if it's just really bad luck, or a bad lot of weak/defective windshields.

        "summary": "Over the weekend, the check engine light came on and I lost heat in my vehicle instantly (like flipping a light switch) after already driving with full heat for about 30 minutes. In addition to losing heat on a zero degree day, the vehicle also lost the capability to circulate and redirect coolant to the engine properly, causing a significant reduction in engine temperature causing it to run nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit less than optimal running temperature. Upon research, the only logical explanation was the failure of the \"thermo control valve\" which was added to the Subaru lineup starting in 2019, and this was just confirmed as the cause of this incident by the dealer.   While coolant issues previously were managed easily in other vehicles, or a slow reduction in the ability of the heating system, having an electronic component control the diversion of coolant in the car for cabin heat and engine heat control seems to be harmful, not only potentially to the engine, but causing the heat to instantly stop to someone that may not be dressed to deal with it while driving in zero degree weather can cause potential significant health problems. This part should not be the sole source of control, let alone be failing without warning after a mere 3 years. In addition, a quick search online provides no information on the product, but many threads of individuals experiencing similar issues, as well as comments that Subaru has recognized it was originally inadequately built and have since produced a more Hardy product to replace them with.   The other issue with this part, is that it is below the intake which needs to be removed to replace it. While the intake and other coolant system items are mentioned under warranty, this part is never mentioned.   For this being a new addition starting in 2019, it is deeply concerning that there are many accounts for this, with no official messaging from Subaru, for such a critical part.",

Two or three days later the battery dies again. This time Subaru put in a replacement battery.  Second time same incident, I took into Subaru service and again the tech said the battery tested OK. I then discussed with the Service Rep. and she agreed to mark the battery bad and to have the battery replaced with again another new battery.

I was going about Highway speed during rush hour 55-65 pmh when the check engine light came ON, the EyeSight feature light came ON, and the emergency Brake light came ON.  Scariest moment in my life.  The vehicle stalled, the steering got really stiff, and the vehicle started sputtering along probably at 2 mph.   I managed to make my way to the breakdown lane and called Subaru Starlink Roadside Assistance.   After towing the vehicle to the dealership, the diagnosis revealed that both tumble generators on the Air Intake Manifold failed and I also needed a fuel line replacement. After doing a lot of research on the internet it appears that Subaru Foresters have a history of these failures and there has been a number of recalls for this particular model detailing the vehicle losing power or stalling.   Unfortunately, the dealership and corporate Subaru refuse to cover the full cost of the repairs as they claim the vehicle is past the warranty period; they have $750 to cover $1800 worth of repairs.   This is clearly a safety issue and defect, and Subaru is clearly neglecting its responsibility to cover known defects from the factory.",

The Engine would turn on and then shut down again.  After 2 hours we turned the car on and drove it 2 car lengths off to the side of the road and kept it idling to get warm, but it overheated after a while and we had to shut it off.  We stayed there until 8:30pm (3.5 hours later) waiting for Subaru Roadside Assistance, but ended up walking home because they never came.

I tried reaching a Subaru near where I was visiting. No luck so I called my Subaru in VT. I was told I was safe to go as long as the Check Engine wasn't blinking. It wasn't so I drove home (I did note the steering wheel felt \"tight\".) When I went into the dealership upon my return, they did their computer diagnostic test. It was explained it could be as simple as not tightening the gas cap.  The computer turned up something in the wheel. At first, he wanted to give me an appointment a week and a half out, but then found a car he could loan me that following Monday. I wanted to know why they needed it several days. He said it was to figure out the issue. When I asked if it was safe to drive, he said it was but there was a possibility of being on the highway and losing control/not being able to stop, but that was rare. I asked about the change in steering, as though the power steering was lost, and he explained they don't have that kind of system. I drove home slowly and went no where except Sunday when I drove a couple of miles to a farm stand close by.  Upon returning into the driveway, I put it in reverse to park. It accelerated and when I tried braking, it wouldn't respond. It was a though everything was locked. The car jolted. Sped. Jolted. The side airbags deployed. My arm was banged up from the airbags but nothing broken. I did not mistake the accelerator for the brake. The floor mat did not get stuck under the accelerator (I've Weather Tech Mats.)  When the car got towed, it started. The tow driver said it should not have done that with the side airbags deployed.   (It won't let me type in the box How Fast Were You Going. It should have been 2mph. The car accelerated and lack of braking and control contributed to the crash.",

I wrote a letter to Subaru regarding the dead battery and associated costs and they refunded my expenditures. Using the vehicle with the new battery was ok for awhile but now this issue is starting again. Looking online at various pieces of information I discovered that I am not the only one with this issue. There is currently a class action lawsuit in New Jersey although I am not sure if it includes Foresters. This site explains about the CAN system in the affected vehicles and in laymen's terms says that after the car is turned off it is supposed to go to sleep but it is not. It is draining the battery continually.  Of course Subaru is fighting this. It will cost them money to recall all these vehicles. But how safe are you when you are out, perhaps in a remote area, and your car is dead? One woman stated that in her vehicle she was stranded overnight. This is NOT safe.

It says \u201covertime, due to initial variation in rear stabilizer bracket dimensions, the rear stabilizer bracket bolts may loosen and possibly detach\u201d.   I purchased my Subaru Forester Touring model 2-2-2019. On 7-20-2020 with only 19;413 miles I experienced a very loud rattle in the rear. My local dealer in Albuquerque, NM found that both rear stabilizer bolts were very loose and about to fall out. They retorqued them to specification and checked for a recall. Of course they found none and said someone at the factory probably didn\u2019t torque to the correct value.   Now I receive this WRD-21 notice. I called Subaru customer service to find out why  this defect is fixed by a simple retorquing of the bolts. Based on their own statement the loosening is caused by a manufacturing error in the stabilizer bracket dimensions. Simple retorquing in my opinion will not fix the defect but only fix the symptoms and probably the bots will become loose again over time due to the imperfections in the stabilizer bracket dimensions as they admitted.   Subaru told me all recalls are approved by the NHTSA before it is sent out. So some engineer at NHTSA must have analyzed the problem and their proposed solution and approved it.  I disagree with the approval and believe the bolts will loosen again under normal use. Many Subaru owners buy the Forrester model for off road use on rough roads. I fear it will happen to me again.   I request NHTSA re-examine this recall and require Subaru to issue another recall to perform a permanent fix to this admitted safety defect in their product.   Please me know your decision at  [XXX]  [XXX] Bernalillo, NM. [XXX]  Or at [XXX]",

THOSE MORNINGS, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE LAST TIME I DROVE THE CAR, AND I COULDN'T THINK OF A NOISE I HEARD, WHICH YOU WOULD TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH A FOREIGN OBJECT HITTING THE WINDSHIELD. NOTHING. NO MATTER HOW FAINT. THE FIRST CRACKED WINDSHIELD HAPPENED AT JUST OVER 10,000 MILES, AND THE SECOND HAPPENED AT 19,500 MILES.  I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS AN ENGINEERING ISSUE WITH SUBARU OF AMERICA.  I VOICED THIS CONCERN TO THE EMPLOYEES AT SUBARU, BUT WAS INFORMED THAT IS WAS NOT AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM.  ADDITIONALLY, THE TWO CRACKS STARTED WITHIN 4 INCHED OF EACH OTHER, BY MY ESTIMATE, SLIGHTLY LEFT OF CENTER IF LOOKING AT IT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR, AND NEAR TO BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD.

THIS HAS HAPPENED WHEN A VEHICLE IN FROM OF US MADE A RIGHT TURN, ROAD AHEAD IS CLEAR, TRAVELING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 35 MPH, SENSORS MUST BE PICKING UP THE CORNER OF THE OTHER VEHICLE AS WE APPROACH, LOCKING UP THE BRAKES, THINKING IT IS STILL IN FRONT OF US. ANOTHER INCIDENT, EYESIGHT SENSING AN EMPTY PAPER BAG BEING BLOWN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY, SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A REAR END COLLISION FROM A DRIVER BEHIND US IF THEY WERE FOLLOWING TO CLOSE, LIKE IS THE NORM IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. ANOTHER EVENT, A DOG RAN ACROSS THE FREEWAY, EYESIGHT NEVER ACTIVATED, I THOUGHT I HAD BRAKED AND CLEARED THE DOG, HE KEPT RUNNING, NO IMPACT, FOUND DAMAGE TO FRONT END UPON INSPECTION. ANOTHER ISSUE UNRELATED TO EYESIGHT, THE DEFROSTER BLOWER MOTOR DOES NOT RESPOND TO HIGH SETTING WHEN FIRST TURNED TO HIGH TO CLEAR WINDOW FOG, IT TAKES 3 TO 5 MINUTES BEFORE IT RAMPS UP TO HIGH SPEED.

THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR, AND THERE WAS NO WIND. WE WE'RE DESCENDING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROADS. SUDDENLY, THE WINDSHIELD MADE A LOUD POP SOUND, AND CRACK STARTED EMERGING FROM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER AREA. THERE WAS NO ROCK OR IMPACT THAT STARTED THE CRACK. AGAIN, THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT OF US THAT COULD HAVE FLUNG DEBRIS AT US. WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS CAUSED BY A PRESSURE CHANGED? WE HAD NO EXPLANATION FOR THE CRACK. THE CRACK CONTINUED TO CREATE A LARGE, ~2 FOOT LONG, QUESTION MARK-SHAPED CRACK INTO THE CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD. WE INSPECTED THE CRACK AND THERE IS NO IMPACT MARK AT ALL, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE CRACK BEGAN BELOW THE BOTTOM SEAL OF THE WINDSHIELD. REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELDS WERE QUOTED IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. READING OTHER FORUM POSTS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT ISOLATED TO JUST OUR CAR.",

I PERFORMED SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND DISCOVERED SPONTANEOUS WINDSHIELD CRACKS ON MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE IS A KNOWN ISSUE DUE TO SUBPAR DEFECTIVE GLASS AND THAT CRACKS ARE CAUSED BY THE HEAT FROM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER HEATER USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER. WHICH IS THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCE MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED IN. RESEARCH ALSO ADVISED THAT THIS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY SUBARU NOR DO THEY COVER REPAIR/REPLACEMENT COSTS. WINDSHIELD REPAIR/REPLACEMENT IS VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL OEM SUBARU GLASS THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR THE SUBARU EYESIGHT SENSORS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY WHICH MY VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH.

ONCE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CRACKS, IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD. DURING THE PROCESS OF PAYING FOR THE VEHICLE, I WAS ENCOURAGED AT EVERY STEP TO PURCHASING ADDITIONAL WINDSHIELD COVERAGE TO COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IN CASE IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE EYESIGHT CAMERA SYSTEM. THE WINDSHIELD HAS CRACKED ON THE INTERSTATE, A STATE TOLLWAY, AND A HIGHWAY.   2. THE BLUE TEMPERATURE LIGHT TURNS ON FOR FIVE MINUTES OR MORE WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE. I HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY DISMISS ME SAYING THAT THIS IS A NORMAL CONDITION OF THE CAR (WHICH WAS NOT MENTIONED DURING THE SALES PROCESS) AND TO JUST WAIT UNTIL THE BLUE TEMPERATURE LIGHT GOES OUT BEFORE DRIVING THE CAR. WHEN TAKING THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD FOR 4TH TIME, THEY FINALLY LISTENED TO ME AND ADDED CHECKING THE COOLANT TO THE LIST BUT IT HAS BEEN A FIGHT TO HAVE THIS LOOKED AT.   3. WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION AND WITH NO OTHER CARS IN FRONT OF ME, TO THE SIDE OR BEHIND ME, THE CAR PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM ACTIVATED AND BRAKED THE CAR ON ITS OWN. THERE WAS NO PRE-WARNING THAT THE CAR WAS GOING TO BRAKE.   4. THE CAR AUTO LIGHT ON AND OFF FUNCTION DOES NOT FULLY TURN ON THE CAR LIGHTS AT NIGHT.   5. WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION AND BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, I HEAR A BIG KA-THUNK SOUND FROM THE FRONT LEFT OF THE CAR. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY THE STEERING IS BEING TURNED.     ORDERED THE CAR IN JUNE 2019, WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR WOULDN'T BE READY UNTIL MID-AUG.

UPON VISITING THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP, THEY SUGGESTED THAT A SMALL ROCK MAY HAVE CHIPPED THE GLASS, BUT THERE IS NO CHIP OR STARBURST WHERE THE POINT OF IMPACT MAY HAVE BEEN. THIS WAS COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS AND WAS NOT INFLUENCED FROM ANY ROCKS/PEBBLES, ETC. BECAUSE SUBARU AND THE DEALERSHIP DISREGARDED  MY CONCERN, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO FILE A CLAIM AS TO NOT RISK THE CHANCE OF BEING PULLED OVER AND ISSUED A TICKET. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS HAPPENED AND REALLY HOPE THAT SUBARU WILL TAKE ACTION.

I TOOK PHOTOS OF SAID DEFECT (KEPT THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENT) AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER, I GAVE THEM THE DEFECTIVE MATERIAL WHICH WAS CRUSTED ON THE SIDE OF THE PAD LINING. THEY BROUGHT THE CAR IN AND TOLD ME IT WAS ROAD DIRT. FORTUNATELY I TOOK PHOTOS OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENT AS WELL AS THE BRAKE PAD. THEY GAVE ME THE CAR BACK WITHOUT CHANGING THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS. THE DEFECTIVE BRAKE PAD HAD A BUILD UP OF THIS CRUSTED OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE MATERIAL FROM BRAKE MANUFACTURE ON THE SIDES OF IT. THIS MATERIAL APPEARED TO HAVE A LAVA CRUSTY TYPE TEXTURE AND IS OBVIOUSLY NOT BRAKE PAD MATERIAL. THE MANUFACTURED BRAKE PADS ARE CURRENTLY ON THE VEHICLE. I CAN NOT UPLOAD PHOTOS ON THIS COMPUTER, DO HAVE PHOTOS HOWEVER.  THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON BRAKE LIFE AND AND PERFORMANCE AS A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE SERVICE BRAKE COMPONENTS. I HAVE THE ACTUAL MILES WHEN THE DEALER BROUGHT IT INTO THE SHOP AS WELL. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER.",
