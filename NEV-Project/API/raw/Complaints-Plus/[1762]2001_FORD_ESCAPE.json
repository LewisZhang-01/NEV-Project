I TOOK MY ESCAPE IN OCTOBER OF 2014 TO HAVE THE FRAME INSPECTED AND TO HAVE THE RECALL PERFORMED.  MY SUB FRAME WAS HEAVILY RUSTED AND THEY DID NOTHING BUT INSTALLED THE METAL BAR.  I'VE BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR THE PAST YEAR AND JUST LAST WEEK WHILE DRIVING MY ESCAPE THE SUB FRAME SNAPPED AND HAD VERY LITTLE TO NO STEERING ONCE IT BROKE.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, WHEN THESE SUB FRAMES BREAK THAT BAR THAT FORD INSTALLED DOES NOTHING TO KEEP YOUR STEERING UNDER CONTROL.  I CONTACTED THE MOTOR COMPANY AND HAULED IT BACK TO THE DEALER THAT DID THE RECALL ON THE ESCAPE.  AFTER THE DEALER SHIP SENT PICTURES TO FORD OF THIS ISSUES THE MOTOR COMPANY SAID IT WASN'T THEIR PROBLEM AND THAT IT WAS SOMETHING I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.  NOW JUST THINK ABOUT THIS, THERE ARE A A LOT OF 2001-2004 ESCAPE ON THE ROAD THAT HAVE THIS ISSUE AND WHEN THESE FRAMES SNAP IT CAN CAUSE A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE DRIVER.  LOSS OF STEERING AND MAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF YOU CANT CONTROL THE VEHICLE TO MAKE A SAFE STOP.  I'M LEFT WITH MY DAILY DRIVING VEHICLE SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY BECAUSE THE MOTOR COMPANY DID NOT REPLACE MY FRAME THAT HAD HEAVY RUST AND RUST HOLES IN IT WHEN I TOOK IT TO A DEALER TO HAVE THE RECALL PERFORMED.  I NEED MY FRAME REPLACED BUT THE MOTOR COMPANY CLAIMS THAT THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED WHEN THEY INSTALLED THAT CHEAP 90 BAR ACROSS THE SUB FRAME.

I LOOKED UNDERNEATH & DISCOVERED MASSIVE CORROSION & RUSTED CROSSBARS, FRAMES, GAS TANK, SHOCKS, ETC.  EVERYTHING UNDER THE VEHICLE WAS RUSTED.  SO, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AND WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE RUNS SO I SHOULD BE HAPPY.  WELL, I FELT MY SAFETY WAS IN QUESTION SO I BEGAN SOME RESEARCH.  WHAT I LEARNED WAS THE VEHICLE WAS NOT PURCHASED FROM \"CARMAX\" AS THE OWNER STATED, BUT THAT IT WAS PURCHASED FROM \"CARMAX AUCTION\".  SO I CONTACTED THEM AND LUCKILY GOT A COPY OF THE BILL OF SALE.  TO MY DISBELIEF THE BILL OF SALE STATES THIS VEHICLE HAS FRAME DAMAGE.  SO I EQUIPPED WITH THIS BILL OF SALE, MET WITH THE OWNER AGAIN.  HE SAID THE CAR DOESN'T HAVE A FRAME, THUS THIS WAS AN ERROR.  HE WOULD NOT AGREE TO REASON AND TOLD ME I PURCHASED IT \"AS IS\".  AS THE DAYS WENT ON MORE AND MORE BEGAN TO FALL APART.  LESS THAN 60 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE, THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED BECAUSE THE BRACE WAS RUSTED AWAY CAUSING THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION TO CRACK SO I HAD TO GET IT REPLACED/REBUILT. MECHANIC SAYS THE TRANSMISSION WAS HANGING DOWN & AMAZED IT HADN'T FALLEN OUT. THE CORROSION WAS SO BAD HE HAD TO WELD A NEW BRACE TO HOLD THE NEW TRANSMISSION BUT IT IS WELDED TO THE FRONT BUMPER BAR BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE WILL SUPPORT ITS WEIGHT. THE SUBFRAME CRADLE CRACKED 2 DAYS BEFORE RECALL 14S02.  I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE SO I HAD TO GET IT FIXED.  IS IT POSSIBLE OTHER PARTS ARE  BUILT WITH THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE SUBFRAME?

THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND, ON 11/14, WAS DRIVEN TO JIM WILSON FORD IN YREKA, CA TO TRY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE AND COST OF REPAIR. THE DEALER SAID THAT TWO OR THREE MALFUNCTIONS COULD HAVE CAUSED THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY, BUT THEY COULDN'T PIN DOWN THE CAUSE. COST OF REPAIR IS ESTIMATED TO BE $2,043.

THERE IS A  PLASTIC COVER ON TOP OF THE ENGINE THAT MUST BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO SEE WHERE THE CABLES HOOK UP TO THE THROTTLE BODY.  I REMOVED THIS TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY OR THE CABLE THAT WAS STUCK.  AS I WAS TAKING IT OFF THE CABLE BECAME UNSTUCK ON IT'S OWN SO I WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  AT THAT POINT I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THEY DID NOTHING.  ON 8/10/05 MY WIFE PUSHED DOWN HARD ON THE GAS PEDAL WHILE MERGING INTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC.  THE ACCELERATOR STUCK WIDE OPEN AGAIN AND SHE FOUND HERSELF GOING ABOUT 100 MPH DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  FINALLY SHE PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, COASTED TO THE BERM AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK.     SINCE THE DEALER COULDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME I DECIDED TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN MYSELF.  AGAIN I TOOK THE PLASTIC COVER OFF THE TOP OF THE ENGINE AND ONCE AGAIN THE CABLE BECAME UNSTUCK.  THIS MADE ME SUSPECT THAT THE PLASTIC COVER MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I FOUND THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HOUSING HAD BROKEN RIGHT BEFORE THE PART THAT CONNECTS TO THE THROTTLE BODY.  THIS CREATES A SITUATION THAT CAN CAUSE THE CRUISE CABLE TO PIVOT UP AND WEDGE AGAINST THE PLASTIC ENGINE COVER DURING HARD ACCELERATION INSTEAD OF IT MOVING IN ITS HOUSING LIKE IT SHOULD THUS CAUSING THE THROTTLE TO STICK WIDE OPEN.  I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN A FEW TIMES SO I AM CONFIDENT THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM.  I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE  DEALER BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WORK ON THE CAR FOR OVER A WEEK SO I WENT TO THE PARTS DEPT. ORDERED THE PART (UNDER $30) WENT HOME AND PUT IT ON MYSELF (TAKES LESS THAN 5 MINUTES). THE CAR IS FIXED NOW.    *NM",

I FEEL THE INCIDENT I CHOSE TO WRITE ABOUT IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AS IT INVOLVES A MALFUNCTION OF THE ANIT-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES BRAKING ACTION (ON DRY PAVEMENT!) WHEN IT OCCURS. I AM ALSO AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO OTHER FORD ESCAPE OWNERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME FAILURE. THE FAILURE CAUSES THE ABS TO ACTIVATE ON DRY PAVEMENT, WHEN ABSOLUTELY NO SLIPPAGE IS OCCURRING AT ANY WHEEL. THE ACTIVITY OF THE ABS SYSTEM ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES BRAKING CAPACITY AND CAUSES THE BRAKE PEDAL TO GO DOWN NOTICEABLY FURTHER THAN NORMAL WHEN ATTEMPTING TO STOP. ONLY A QUICK AVOIDANCE MANEUVER ALLOWED ME TO AVOID REAR-ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. PUMPING THE BRAKES DOES NOT HELP SINCE THE ABS HYDRAULIC CONTROL MODULE IS MODULATING THE BRAKES AT SUCH A RATE, PUMPING THE BRAKE DOES NOT PRODUCE A FIRMER PEDAL. I HAVE TRACED THE PROBLEM TO A FAULTY ABS SYSTEM ROTATION TRANSDUCER DESIGN ON THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE ESCAPE. THE TRANSDUCER IS BASICALLY A SPLINED RING ABOUT 8MM WIDE. THE RING IS APPARENTLY FRICTION FIT ONTO THE HALF-SHAFT NEAR THE FRONT CV JOINTS JUST INSIDE OF THE FRONT HUB ASSEMBLY. A SENSOR APPARENTLY PICKS UP THE PEAKS OR VALLEYS IN THE SPLINED RING AS IT ROTATES PAST THE SENSOR TO DETERMINE WHEEL ROTATION SPEED. IT IS THE SPLINED RING THAT FAILS, MINE ACTUALLY SPLIT ACROSS ITS WIDTH CAUSING IT TO LOOSEN AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE SENSOR. THIS APPARENTLY CAUSES THE ABS SYSTEM TO OPERATE ERRATICALLY AND ACTUALLY CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BRAKING CAPACITY ON DRY PAVEMENT! THIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR WILL OCCUR 5-10 TIMES BEFORE THE ABS CONTROLLER DETERMINES THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG AND SWITCHES OFF THE ABS SYSTEM. THIS ILLUMINATES THE ABS INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL AND DOES RESTORE NORMAL BRAKING PERFORMANCE. THIS CYCLE WILL REPEAT ITSELF EACH TIME THE TRUCK IS SHUT OFF AND RESTARTED!!",

I FEEL LIKE I GOT RIPPED OFF FOR A USELESS TRANSMISSION SERVICE. TO THIS DAY THE TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO FEEL LIKE IT HAS A PROBLEM. WHAT I'M DOING TO GET IT TO WORK IS STARTING THE ENGINE AND PUTTING IT IN DRIVE. I PRESS ON THE OVERDRIVE BUTTON THAT IS LOCATED AT THE END OF THE GEAR SHIFTER.  THIS WILL GET ME GOING AS I START TO ACCELERATE. HOWEVER, IF I DIDN'T PRESS ON THE OVERDRIVE BUTTON TO GET GOING, THE ACCELERATION WOULD BE POOR AND SOMETIME NOT GO.

I WANT PROBLEM FIXED BEFORE I HAVE AN ACCIDENT WITH NO ABS BRAKES.  THEY BLAME THE PROBLEM ON ME FOR NOT KEEPING IT CLEAN.  I CANT WASH IT EVERYTIME I USE IT AND I SHOULDN'T HALF TO IF THEY WOULD REDESIGN IT.*AK",

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MAXWELL FORD AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR!   I CONTACTED THE PRESIDENT/ CEO TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN OVER WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.    HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MOVED.   I PICKED UP MY CAR AND HOPED IT WAS JUST A FLUKE.   TWO AND-A-HALF YEARS LATER AND NOT A SINGLE PROBLEM, UNTIL LAST WEEK (APRIL 9, 2004).    I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40MPH AROUND A CURVE AND SUDDENLY LOST ALL ABILITY TO STEER OR SLOW DOWN!   ONCE AGAIN, I WAS UNBELIEVABLY LUCKY THAT I DIDN'T HURT ANYONE OR MYSELF.  I WAS ABLE TO START IT AGAIN AND SAFELY PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER COASTING TO A STOP.   I'M GRATEFUL THAT I WASN'T REAR-ENDED OR HIT HEAD-ON WHEN I COASTED OVER THE MIDDLE LINE.... (NEVERMIND THE HEART-ATTACK I ALMOST HAD FROM THE SUDDENNESS OF THIS!)   I HATE TO IMAGINE THE OUTCOME IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 10 MINUTES EARLIER WHILE I WAS MOVING AT 55MPH IN BUSY TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY OR ON THE EXIT RAMP!    I HAVE AN APPT TO TAKE THE CAR IN ON FRIDAY.  COINCIDENTALLY, I DISCOVERED (THIS MORNING) THAT A RECALL HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.... (2 YEARS AFTER THEY WERE MADE AWARE THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ISSUE????)    WHAT A RELIEF.    SO, I'LL BE BACK ON HWY 410 IN SAN ANTONIO NEXT WEEK AFTER I PICK MY CAR UP FROM THE SERVICE DEPT ---  I'LL BE THE ONE IN THE FORD ESCAPE GOING ABOUT 60MPH.....  I SURE HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO STEER OR SLOW DOWN IF I NEED TO!!    AT LEAST, I'LL BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THIS \"SURPRISE\" FROM NOW ON   ( LIKE EVERYTIME  I HAVE TO DRIVE ANYWHERE)!  ....

THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN HAD ORIGINALLY TOLD US THAT THE ENGINE HAD GONE BAD BECAUSE WE HAD NOT CHANGED THE OIL OR HAD PUT THE WRONG OIL IN IT.

WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE CAR THROUGH HIGH WATER.  WE WERE TOLD BY A DIFFERENT FORD MECHANIC THAT DUST AND POLLEN IN THE AIR CAN CAUSE THE YELLOWING.

THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ESCAPE. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM & THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE BUT CALL IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  MY VEHICLE STALLED THE NEXT DAY.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE STALL. THEY CONTACTED THEIR REPAIR HOTLINE FOR SUGGESTIONS.  THERE WAS APPARENTLY NO REAL ANSWER BUT IT WAS SUGGESTED TO REPLACE A VARIETY OF PARTS.  MY VEHICLE HAD NO PROBLEMS UNTIL 06/25/02 WHEN IT STALLED AGAIN FOR NO REASON.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IN EACH INSTANCE I WAS TRAVELLING AT APPROXIMATELY 45MPH ON A DOWNHILL (WITH PLENTY OF GAS IN THE TANK) AND THE VEHICLE STALLED W/OUT ANY WARNING.  MY RADIO & LIGHTS CONTINUED TO WORK JUST FINE. NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOST MY POWER STEERING AND BRAKES ON EACH OCCASION.  THE FIRST 2 OCCASIONS I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MUSCLE MY CAR ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD W/OUT INCIDENT.  I PUT IT IN PARK & IT STARTED RIGHT UP.  THE LAST TIME I HAD TO SHIFT IT INTO NEUTRAL ON THE FLY & RESTART THE ENGINE.  LUCKILY FOR ME IT RESTARTED AS I HAD NOWHERE TO PULL OVER AS I WAS HEADED TOWARDS A TWO LANE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER WITH NO SHOULDER TO PULL ONTO.  I HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY IN THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN INJURED NOR HAVE I INJURE ANYONE ELSE.   THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT AND A POTENTIALLY DEADLY ONE.  I KNOW FROM DOING SOME RESEARCH THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OTHERS WITH THIS PROBLEM ON BOTH THE 2001 & 2002 MODELS.  THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY BEFORE THERE IS A FATALITY.  A BRAND NEW CAR SHOULD NOT STALL AT RANDOM TIMES WITH NO WARNING WHILE TRAVELLING AT A PRETTY GOOD SPEED.*AK",

I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF & WAITED ABOUT 30 SEC.  IT STARTED NO PROBLEM. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THAT MORNING & WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT TO CALL BACK SHOULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN.  ON 10/24/01 THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN AT THE SAME POINT IN MY COMMUTE UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES.  ONCE AGAIN I WAS ABLE TO START THE VEHICLE WITH NO PROBLEMS AFTER PULLING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN & TOOK IT IN.  OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG W/ IT & THE CALLED THE FORD HOTLINE FOR ANY RECOMMENDATIONS.  I BROUGHT IT BACK THE FOLLOWING WEEK SO THEY COULD REPLACE THE IDLE MOTOR & A FEW OTHER THINGS.  THE DEALERSHIP STATES THERE IS NO RECALL & IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS OR HOW TO FIX IT, THE HOTLINE JUST RECOMMENDED SOME THINGS TO DO HOPING IT WOULD FIX IT.  SHORTLY AFTER THAT I NOTICED MY VEHICLE WAS LEAKING FLUID (11/15/01) ABOUT A WEEK AFTER AN OIL CHANGE. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE OIL CHANGE PLACE & THEY SAID IT WASN'T OIL BUT I HAD A PRETTY BIG LEAK OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE TRANSMISSION FLUID.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO THE DEALER.  IT ENDED UP BEING DIFFERENTIAL FLUID & THEY REPLACED THE POWER TRANSFER CASE.  SO FAR MY VEHICLE HASN'T STALLED OR LEAKED ANY OTHER FLUIDS.  MY BIGGEST CONCERN HOWEVER, IS THE STALLING PROBLEM WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE VERY DANGEROUS.  I WAS LUCKY IN THAT I WASN'T ON THE HIGHWAY & IT WAS VERY EARLY & I HAD A PLACE TO PULL OVER SO I DIDN'T GET HIT.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.  *AK",

I SHIFTED THE VEHICLE TO NEUTRAL AND RE-STARTED WHILE MOVING TO AVOID A REAR-END COLLISION.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE DEALER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEY SCHEDULED ME FOR 2 DAYS LATER.  THE PERSON ON THE PHONE WAS AWARE OF FORD ESCAPES STALLING YET WHEN I DISCUSSED IT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER HE SAID HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ESCAPES STALLING AND NONE HAD BEEN IN FOR SERVICE FOR THIS REASON \"TO HIS KNOWLEDGE\".  I PERCEIVED THIS AS DECEIT.  HE THEN SAID HE WOULD CONDUCT AN \"OASIS\" IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM FORD ABOUT KNOWN PROBLEMS.  AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE FOR THE DAY, THEY TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG.  I REQUESTED A LIST OF WHAT WAS DONE AS REQUIRED BY NEW JERSEY LAW.  I TOLD THEM I DID NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE AND THAT THIS WAS THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT AT FIXING THE PROBLEM.  I ALSO STATED THAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND THEY STILL DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, I WOULD SEEK A FULL REFUND UNDER NEW JERSEY'S LEMON LAW, FIRST BY SENDING A CERTIFIED LETTER TO FORD.

I SHIFTED THE AUTOMATIC INTO PARK, TURNED THE KEY, THE CAR STARTED AND I EXTRICATED MY 7 YEAR OLD SON AND MYSELF FROM THE BUSY INTERSECTION AND FROM THE MOUTH OF ON-COMING TRAFFIC (WE LANDED IN THE LEFT TURN LANE, MUCH TO A JEEP'S DISMAY).

I LEFT THE CAR WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  ON 9/8/01, I CALLED AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE CAR WAS READY. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO REVIEW THE REPAIRS WITH ME & MY HUSBAND AND TO EXPLAIN WHY THE REPAIR \"FIXED\" THE PROBLEM. HE SAID THEY REPLACED A VALVE WHICH CONTROLS AIR FLOW. HE SAID THIS WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO SHUT OFF, ESPECIALLY IF I HAD BEEN ENGAGING THE BRAKES WHEN THE CAR SHUT OFF. I WAS ENGAGING THE BRAKES WHEN IT SHUT OFF, SO I ACCEPTED THIS EXPLANATION. I PACKED MY 7 YEAR OLD INTO THE SUV AND LEFT.  WITHIN 7-10 MILES, THE CAR SHUT ITSELF OFF, AGAIN (ONLY 26 HOURS AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT AND THE SUPPOSED \"FIX\")!

        "summary": "WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NAMED IN THIS COMPLAINT IN OCT. 2000 AND WITHIN FOUR DAYS OF THE PURCHASE RETURNED IT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCED GASOLINE FUMES (NOT EXHAUST) COMING THROUGH THE AIR VENTS WITH EITHER HEAT/AIR OR A/C ON.  THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR FOR OVER A WEEK AND SAID THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT, THOUGH SERVICE PEOPLE SMELLED THE GAS FUME SMELL.  WE RETURNED THE CAR A SECOND TIME AS THE SMELL WAS GETTING STRONGER.  IT OCCURS ON WARM STARTS, NEVER WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED UP COLD.  THE FUME SMELL IS APPARENT FOR 5-10 MINUTES, AND THINS OUT WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING AT HIGH SPEEDS AND AIR IS COMING IN.  THE SECOND TIME THE DEALER HAD THE CAR THEY KEPT IT A WEEK AND COULD NOT FIX IT.  THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH ANOTHER.   TEN DAYS LATER WE TOOK OWNERSHIP OF ANOTHER VEHICLE EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE.  FORTY-EIGHT HOURS INTO DRIVING IT THE GAS SMELL WAS NOTICEABLE AGAIN.  WE NOTIFIED THE DEALER WHO SAID THAT FORD HAS NO FIX FOR IT.  THE DEALER HAD NO COMMENT OR IDEA ON WHEN/IF/HOW THIS WOULD BE RESOLVED.  WE WENT OUT TO THE INTERNET AND IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS, EDMUNDS.COM AND YAHOO ESCAPE CLUB AMONG OTHERS, WE FOUND TESTIMONIAL AFTER TESTIMONIAL OF CUSTOMERS OWNING THE V-6 ESCAPE, AND THE MIRROR CAR, THE MAZDA TRIBUTE, HAVING EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEMS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED.  THIS IS CLEARLY NOT AN ISOLATED EXCEPTION WITH OUR VEHICLE.  ONE PERSON EXPERIENCED HIS CAR BURNING TO THE GROUND WITH 800 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  WE WANT TO ALERT YOU TO THIS PROBLEM AND THE FACT THAT FORD/MAZDA ARE BEING TOTALLY UNCOMMUNICATIVE TO THE CUSTOMER ABOUT THIS SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW.  WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE CAR IS EVEN SAFE TO DRIVE.  OUR DEALER HAS NO INFORMATION ON  A FIX AND HAS NOT OFFERED TO TAKE THIS CAR BACK.  WE INTEND TO MEET WITH THEM AGAIN, BUT IF THEY FOLLOW THE SAME SUIT AS MOST OF THE DEALERS THAT OTHER TROUBLED ESCAPE CUSTOMERS HAVE APPROACHED, IT WILL BE A PROBLEM.  *AK",
