        "summary": "2008 Ford Fusion was recalled by Ford because of an anti-lock brake system failure. The first Safety Recall Notice 19S54 was issued in 2019. We got notification of the recall from ford in early 2020. The notification clearly stated and was confirmed by a call to Ford Corporate and our Ford Dealer Park Ford of Mahopac NY that parts for the repair were not available and that we would be informed when they do become available. We were informed that parts were available and we brought the car in for two recall repairs. A recall to replace the Driver side airbag was Completed but not for the Anti-lock brake system. Instead they ran a test on the system and a procedure to try to fix the issue without having to replace parts. This procedure rendered the car unsafe to drive because the brake pedal now needs to be pumped to get pressure for the brakes to be operational. Although this test failed and rendered the car unsafe ford released the car with a promise to replace the parts when they become available. A call to Ford corporate to inform them of this safety issue was that they have no programs that cover the vehicle any more to help in this situation. The Anti-lock brake system originally failed around 2014. We noticed the problem when the Anti-lock brake warning light would intermittently come on. After a period of time of daily driving the vehicle the light remained on the the brake system became spongy. Local repair confirmed the problem and diagnosed it to be an anti-lock brake HCU failure. After getting the vehicle to invoke the anti-lock system while driving the pedal fade disappeared. So the car drove normally but the Anti-lock light was illuminated. Every year the car passed NYS inspection and the brakes were tested. A total brake job replacing brake lines, calipers, drums and rotors was completed in 2020. The system passed with normal braking operation even though the Anti-lock Brake warning light was still on. So for years after the failure the system operated",

Ford dealership stated that recall only called for fluids to be flushed and unit tested for pass/fail. At time of recall repair the unit passed. ABS Control Module replacement units available at this time.  July 2021, 1300 miles since recall repair I was driving vehicle in the rain, pressed on brake. Brake pedal went to floor again. Took vehicle back into service to have inspected. Ford Service center said they preformed the recall repair as they were required to and now it is my responsibility to replace the defective part. ABS Control Module backordered until at least Oct 2021. Currently 600th in line.  This is the scariest safety issue i have ever seen in any vehicle on the road. The inability to brake when needed especially in adverse conditions such as rain or hitting a minor bump in the road, triggering the ABS unit and the valve getting stuck open for periods of time consisting of weeks and months without brake pressure. Not only is it unsafe for the most experienced driver to use the vehicle, i also cannot morally sell this vehicle to someone else as i know how likely they could crash resulting in serious injury. Ford Corporate unhelpful, Ford Dealer Service Center knows of issue and that its defective but cant replace it under recall without corporate approval.",

THEY CONTACTED FORD CORPORATE TO DETERMINE THE NEXT ACTION, AND FORD STATED THAT THE FIX AND PARTS FOR IT ARE UNAVAILABLE UNTIL LATE 1ST QUARTER 2020.  FORD SUGGESTED THAT THE DEALER COMPLETE AN ADVANCED DIAGNOSIS PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE ISSUE, AT A COST OF $300 TO ME.

I HAVE NOW BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR 2 WEEKS, AND IT APPEARS I MAY BE UNTIL MARCH. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, AND FORD'S UNWILLINGNESS TO ACT ON THIS SAFETY ISSUE IS APPALLING.

I FOUND THE INFORMATION ONLINE AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE AND HEARING REPORTS OF A MASSIVE RECALL IN THE NEWS.     AROUND JUNE 25, 2016 ON A PARTICULARLY HOT AND HUMID DAY, THE AIRBAG COMPARTMENT EXPANDED AND CREATED A BUMP IN THE DASHBOARD.

THE FIRST TWO DEALERS SAID THERE'S NOTHING THEY COULD DO AS THE REPLACEMENT AIRBAGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. ONE DEALER SAID THEY COULD REPLACE THE AIRBAG IF WE PAY OVER $600. THEY ALSO ASSURED ME THAT THE BULGING DASHBOARD AND OOZING GEL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL, BUT I WAS WELCOME TO WORK WITH TAKATA AFTER PAYING FOR THE AIRBAG TO TRY TO GET A REFUND.

IN MOST CASES, THE PREVIOUS OWNERS OF THESE AFFECTED VEHICLES DID NOT REPLACE THE INFLATORS UNDER THOSE RECALLS AND, THUS, THE VEHICLES REMAIN UNREPAIRED. NOW, BECAUSE OF THE TIME THAT HAS PASSED, THEY ARE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO RUPTURE IF THE DRIVER'S AIRBAG DEPLOYS IN A CRASH. IN FACT, IN TESTING DONE BY TAKATA, ALPHA INFLATORS REMOVED FROM VEHICLES IN CONSISTENTLY HOT AND HUMID AREAS SHOWED A RUPTURE RATE AS HIGH AS 50 PERCENT.\"  CAN I EXPECT THE SAME, HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF KILL RATE, IN THE INFLATORS IN MY 2007 MUSTANG AND 2008 FUSION AS THEY AGE, AS FOUND BY HONDA?  I WILL PAY TO HAVE THE AIRBAGS/INFLATORS REPLACED - REQUEST YOUR OFFICE PROVIDE THE CORRECT PART NUMBERS AND RECOMMENDED PLACE TO HAVE THE WORK CORRECTLY ACCOMPLISHED.

I'VE CONTACTED FORD MOTOR THROUGH THEIR CHAT LINE AND BEEN TOLD THE SAME THING THE LETTER SAID, \"YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED\".  I YEAR (ALMOST) LATER I STILL LIVE IN FEAR WHEN SOMEONE HAS TO RIDE IN MY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT!  THIS IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS AND SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THE GOOD OLD USA.  I HAVE A FRIEND WITH AN ACCORD (HONDA) WHO GOT HER CAR FIXED WITHIN ABOUT 4 MONTHS (SAME PROBLEM) AND ANOTHER WHO HAS AN INFINITI WHO GOT THEIR CAR FIXED (SAME PROBLEM) IN ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  PRETTY MUCH SAYS, \"DON'T BUY AMERICAN\" IN MY ESTIMATION!  AFTER 1 YEAR, I THINK FORD SHOULD START COMPENSATING PEOPLE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THIS INCONVENIENT IT IS DANGEROUS.

A FIRM BRAKING WAS BEING DONE, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO KICK IN ABS UNTIL GOING OVER A PAINTED RR CROSSING SIGN ON THE ROAD.  THE PAINT WAS SLIPPERY AND CAUSED THE ABS TO FIRE AND IMMEDIATELY IT FELT LIKE THE BRAKES WENT OUT ENTIRELY.  PUSHING ALMOST TO THE FLOOR WOULD STOP THE CAR AND AT THAT POINT THEY BRAKES FELT STRONG.  THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES. IT HAPPENED AGAIN A SECOND TIME WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN.  I WAS GOING A BIT TO FAST INTO THE TURN AND THE ROAD WAS ROUGH.  SAME SYMPTOMS.  IT'S HAPPENED PROBABLY 4 OR 5 TIMES IN TOTAL.  ONCE IT HAPPENED MAKING A RIGHT TURN INTO A BUSINESS.  I WENT OVER A BUMP IN THE ROAD THAT YOU NORMALLY PAY NO ATTENTION TO (RAISED AREA WHERE A PIPE OR SOMETHING WAS DUG UP AND REPLACED, THEN PAVED OVER).  THE IMMEDIATE LOSS OF PEDAL FIRMNESS AND BRAKING POWER CAUSED ME TO OVERSHOOT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE.  IF A CAR HAD BEEN EXITING, I WOULD HAVE HIT IT.  MOST OF THE TIME THE PROBLEM RESOLVES ITSELF IN A DAY OR SO, BUT THE LONGEST LASTED ABOUT 5 DAYS.  I'M HESITANT TO GET IT FIXED BECAUSE THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  INTERNET RESEARCH ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THIS VERY COMMON ISSUE IS BEING DIAGNOSED AS A FAILING MASTER CYLINDER AND MANY PEOPLE INDICATE THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  AS OF NOW, THIS IS NOT FIXED.

AS A SINGLE MOM WITH NO INCOME AT THIS TIME, THE CAR NOW HAS BEEN PARKED FOR 3 MONTHS.  SO I HAVE HAD TIME TO DO SOME RESEARCH:  THE BRAKE FLUID WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.  THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF BRAKE FLUID LEAK. I DID FIND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PLASTIC ON THE BRAKE BOOSTER IF CORRODED, THAT THE BRAKE FLUID WAS BEING SUCKED INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, LEAVING NO SIGNS OF IT LEAKING.    I ALSO FOUND BY DOING A SIMPLE SEARCH ON THE WEB FORUMS:   THE SAME ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BY OTHER 2008 FORM FUSION OWNERS. AND IF YOU PAID ATTENTION BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT VIN NUMBER, ALL OF THE CARS WERE PRODUCED ON THE SAME LINE, IN THE SAME PLANT, AT THE SAME TIME FRAME. AND WERE ABOUT 100 CARS APART CONSECUTIVELY DOWN THE LINE.     I HAVE HAD A MASTER MECHANIC DO A DIAGNOSTICS:  THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER BOTH NEED REPLACED. ALSO A MISFIRE WAS HAPPENING.  HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED IF THIS CAUSES THAT.  WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL I GET THE BRAKES FIXED.  I DON'T KNOW HOW I, A 38 YEAR OLD SINGLE MOM FROM IOWA CAN SEE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OBVIOUS RECALL FROM YOU AND FORD.

I HAVE NOT REPLACED ANYTHING IN RELATION TO THIS PROBLEM DUE TO THE FACT OF MY BRAKES GOING BACK TO \"NORMAL\" AND THE ABS CONTROL MODULE BEING SO EXPENSIVE TO FIX. SO I AM TAKING MY CHANCES THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN UNTIL THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE.

THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AND WHEN BRAKING AND HITTING A PATCH OF ICE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABS ACTIVATE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BRAKES DO NOT RETURN TO NORMAL IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE ABS PUMP VALVES GET STUCK AND THE BRAKE FLUID CIRCULATES.  IT TAKES TIME TO COME BACK TO NORMAL WHICH IS NOT A NORMAL THING.  WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE PUMP/CONTROL MODULE SHOULD BE RECALLED.    IF YOU WERE TO GOOGLE SEARCH FORD FUSION BRAKE PROBLEMS AND OR SOFT BRAKE PEDALS, ETC (REGARDING THE FUSION) YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF INFORMATION. I AM A FORD LOVER AND LOVE MY FUSION BUT IT IS DISTURBING THAT FORD REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE THIS AS A SAFETY RECALL AFTER EMAILS AND CONTACT WITH FORD.  I COPIED ONE LINK TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE PROBLEM.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  THE BRAKES SHOULD RETURN TO NORMAL INSTANTLY, NOT AFTER AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME.      THANK YOU.

THIS MORNING MY MOTHER TOOK IT TO WORK AND SHE WAS FORCED TO RUN A RED LIGHT AT 5:30 AM BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT STOP BECAUSE THE PEDAL WAS SOFT. EVERY TIME THE PEDAL WENT SOFT, IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS MAKING A TURN. THE SPEEDS I WAS GOING AT WERE 40MPH, 35MPH AND 20MPH.    AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH, I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MASTER CYLINDER, BRAKES, ROTORS NOR CALIPERS, BUT HAS TO DO WITH THE ABS AND HCU.",

HOPING WITH MORE COMPLAINTS THIS WILL BE FIXED.   *JS",

SEVERAL MILES BEFORE I BROUGHT IT IN FOR SERVICE FOR THE BELOW PROBLEM THE CAR BEGAN MAKING A HOWLING/WHIRRING NOISE AT THE REAR OF THE ENGINE ONLY WHEN THE CAR WAS IN MOTION WHICH GOT LOUDER AS THE SPEED INCREASED.  IMY FORD DEALER TOLD ME THE NOISE WAS BECAUSE OF A BAD DRIVESHAFT AND IT SHOULD BE REPLACED ASAP AS DRIVING IT THE WAY IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  MY CAR HAD JUST COME OUT THE MANUFACTURER'S 60,000 MILE WARRANTY AND I WAS NOT PLEASED TO LEARN THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $1103.35 FOR THE REPAIR. THE DEALER TRIED TO GET FORD TO OK THE REPAIR UNDER MY JUST EXPIRED WARRANTY. IF THE SHAFT SUDDENLY FAILED, IT COULD CAUSE CONTROL PROBLEMS SO IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE PARTICULARLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH I FOUND THAT FORD WAS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND EVEN ISSUED AN INTERNAL TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN # TSB 08-14-1 STATING THAT THE OEM DRIVESHAFTS ON THE 2008 FORD FUSION AWD MODELS WERE NOT \"KEYED\" CORRECTLY WHEN MANUFACTURED AND OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL AND DISLODGE FROM THE VEHICLE. A REVISED SHAFT WAS MANUFACTURED AND SHOULD BE USED TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE SHAFTS.  FORD KNEW OF THE POTENTIALLY PART FAILURE BUT RATHER THAN NOTIFY THE OWNERS OR HAVE A SAFETY RECALL, THEY CHOSE TO KEEP IT \"IN-HOUSE\" AND ONLY FIX IT WHEN THE OWNERS REPORTED IT. SINCE THE MOST FAILURES SEEMED TO OCCUR NEAR THE 60,000 MILE POINT (MINE WAS JUST OVER THAT), FORD CHOSE TO ADOPT A \"WAIT AND SEE\" ATTITUDE ON THIS PROBLEM/SAFETY ISSUE.  SINCE THE SHAFT REPAIR ONE YEAR AGO, I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE DISTRICT FORD REPRESENTATIVE AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF FORD, ALAN [XXX] ABOUT HOW THIS WAS HANDLED BUT TO NO AVAIL. I AM SHOCKED AND DISMAYED THAT FORD WOULD TREAT ITS CUSTOMERS THIS WAY (I OWN 3 FORDS) AND THE WAY THEY HANDLED THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE.

SHE TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR SEVERAL TIMES AND ALMOST PANICKED. SHE WAS TRAPPED INSIDE. FORTUNATELY HER CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH A MICROSOFT SYNC SYSTEM AND SHE WAS ABLE TO CALL ME INSIDE THE HOUSE FROM THE GARAGE. I CAME TO HER AND WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE THE DRIVER'S DOOR LOCK DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISENGAGE WHEN SHE SHUT THE KEY OFF. SHE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW AND I REACHED INSIDE TO TEST THE INNER DOOR HANDLE AND LOCK. THE LOCK WAS STUCK AND THE HANDLE JUST MOVED FREELY BACK AND FORTH AS I PULLED ON IT. FINALLY, AFTER WIGGLING THE INNER LOCK BACK AND FORTH MANY TIMES I WAS ABLE TO DISENGAGE THE DOOR LOCK. I THEN COULD OPEN THE DOOR BY USING THE OUTSIDE DRIVERS DOOR HANDLE. SHE GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND I PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE THE DOOR MECHANISM. I REMOVED THE COVER PLATE AND SAW THAT THE PLASTIC ACTUATOR ARM ON THE INNER END OF THE DOOR HANDLE HAD BROKEN IN TWO AND PART OF IT HAD GOTTEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LOCKING MECHANISM. SO I CAME INSIDE AND SEARCHED ON-LINE TO BUY A NEW REPLACEMENT HANDLE. DURING MY SEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE CLAIMING THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT YEARS OF FORD FUSIONS. FORTUNATELY FOR MY WIFE SHE WASN'T INVOLVED IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT AND COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED BUT I BELIEVE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF THIS POTENTIALLY DEFECTIVE PART. I FEEL THAT EVEN THOUGHT THE VEHICLE HAS HIGH MILEAGE THIS PART SHOULD NEVER FAIL. THIS ACTUATOR ARM IS JUST A VERY, VERY, THIN PIECE OF PLASTIC AND I SUSPECT THAT ALL FOUR INNER DOOR HANDLES OF THE FORD FUSION ARE OF THE SAME DESIGN.  *TR",

TO MY DISMAY, BOTH GENTLEMEN RELAYED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH FORD FUSIONS, AND THAT THE TECHNICIAN, HIMSELF HAD REPAIRED 8-12 SUCH ISSUES IN THE LAST YEAR.

I ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL OR IF CUSTOMERS WERE FORCED TO PAY TO REPLACE THESE FLAWED PARTS.
