THE CAR WAS IN MOTION, PULLING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT OF THE BUILDING WHERE SHE WORKS. FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS ABLE TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE AND STOP THE VEHICLE, AND THANKFULLY SHE WAS NOT INJURED.    UPON INSPECTION, WE DISCOVERED THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO CORRODED BRAKE LINES. THE LINES LEAKED IN THE RIGHT REAR AREA, NEAR THE WHEEL. INVESTIGATING ONLINE, I DISCOVERED A HUGE RECALL OF SUBARUS AROUND THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL AS MY MOM'S.     BUT ACCORDING TO SUBARU OF AMERICA AND NHTSA, UNFORTUNATELY, MY MON'S CAR IS FOR SOME REASON NOT COVERED BY THIS RECALL. THAT SEEMS LIKE AN OVERSIGHT, BECAUSE THE LINES ARE DEFINITELY CORRODED, AND MY MOM LIVES IN THE SAME 'SALT BELT' AREA (WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS) WHERE THE 600K+ OTHER, COVERED, SUBARUS ARE.    I KNOW RECALL INVESTIGATIONS TAKE TIME, SO THIS COMPLAINT PROBABLY WON'T HELP US ' MOM WILL HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO REPAIR THE LINES, WHICH WILL LIKELY COST ALL OF HER LIMITED MONTHLY INCOME FROM SOCIAL SECURITY AND JOBS ' BUT IF MAKING THIS COMPLAINT HELPS OTHERS, IT'S WELL WORTH THE EFFORT.
