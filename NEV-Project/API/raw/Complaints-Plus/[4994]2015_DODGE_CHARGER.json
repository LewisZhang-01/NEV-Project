        "summary": "V6 3.6 L Pentastar engine has serious misfire issues, I purchased a vehicle with 150k miles on it, it had check engine light on, I brought it to a local dealer service center in Dodge Koons/Tysons VA. After $900 diagnostics it was recommended to swap the engine for a brand new one. I agreed, after a month of waiting, I received my car back with the new engine installed total bill was almost $10000. After 6-7 months of driving with the new engine the check engine turned on again, so I wend back to Koons and they said the problem with the oil pressure sensor that is not cover under the engine warranty (another $550 bill). And yesterday on 02/25/2022 after a month from the last repair I had the check engine flashing again while I was driving on a highway, the car was vibrating, steering wheel was not responsive either. When I came home I found out that the flashing check engine light indicates a misfire. That means that the brand new engine has the same problem as the one that I recently replaced. This is definitely a manufacturing defect and it\u2019s 100% not safe that they make engines like this. I will try to get my warranty though and will probably try to sell the vehicle after they fix it (hopefully no bill from Koons this time, but still 50 % unsure about it) , the fact that they produce and install them in cars is unprecedented in such a high volume (I read articles online that many people having this problem with their dodge vehicles), I\u2019m an experienced driver but even for me it was scary to drive in such extreme conditions.",
