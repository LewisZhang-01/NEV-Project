HONDA TSB 20-100. I took my car in to the local dealer, dealer performed a software update, 2 days after software update, all warning lights turn on in dash and do not go away. Check engine light, Power steering problem , hill start assist, vehicle stability control, trailer assist, traction control. Took vehicle back to the dealership. The service advisor takes the car back and when I return a few hours later he states that his technician informed him the injectors must also be replaced when the software update is done. Then I am informed that due to previous salvage history (from 2017) the vehicle emissions warranty extension will not be covered by Honda and I will be required to pay roughly $1,500 for this repair. The TSB states that all 2016 Honda pilots are covered. The faulty injectors were an issue from the factory on every single last 2016 pilot that was produced. The dealership caused these lights to come on and now wants me to pay to fix the additional issues they caused.",

Reading more about this issue, it seems that a lot of people with the same year 2016 Honda Pilot were having the same issue.

Unfortunately, the manufacturing has failed to communicate this to the public, and we had to let our autobody Honda dealership about this widespread issue. A resolution that was explained by some on this website was replacing the keyless control unit, which by the way is on a nationwide backorder. Which is peculiar? This is apparently an issue with this specific model year, and Honda not addressing the issue is a problem. The customer shouldn't bear the responsibility of paying for this electrical or component issue with their vehicle. It seems like this could be a potential safety issue too, if for some reason this affects the computer system of the vehicle. It definitely is not safe, as the alarm is triggered for no reason when the doors are locked! That is an insurance issue, if you can't lock your vehicle because of threat of it being stolen.",

The second system report indicated permanent transmission codes of P0730, P07A6, P190B, P286D and temporary transmission codes of P0730, P07A2, P07A6. My wife discovered a thread of comments about others who experienced the issue and they said a new battery fixed the issue. A new battery was put in the car but it only drove in reverse. Our body shop consulted with the same Honda Dealership discovered Honda Service bulletin 19-004, which mentioned a transmission software issue, much like my wife experienced the first time, not the second time.

According to Honda, there is a special mechanical device that tow truck drivers would have that physically attaches to the engine to shift the car into neutral.  In addition, the honda mechanic that I talked to today said even if the average driver had one of these devices, they would not recommend they use it due to likelihood of causing damage to the engine or transmission.  This is fine if the car is already in park, since it would most likely be located in a parking lot, residence, etc.  The two times that would be a safety issue and could very easily cause an accident would be if the car was in drive, stopped at a traffic light with the engine off due to the  Auto Start/Stop feature, and suffered a battery failure, preventing the engine from starting.  Now the car would not be able to start, but more importantly couldn't even be pushed off to the side of the road and clear the intersection, since there is no way to move it into neutral.  Another example could be with an alternator failure while driving, where the battery then surges and drains itself, with the engine and car now shut down.  If you are unable to move the car to the side of the road as this is happening, maybe stuck in traffic or stopped at a traffic light, the car is now unmovable until a tow truck driver arrives and installs this mechanical neutral unlock device. There should be a way with an electrical problem to be able to place the car into neutral and move it.

Instead of the engine starting up again, the car would stall completely and I would have to put the car in park, press the brake pedal and push the start button to get it on again. I took the car into the dealer David McDavid Frisco and they did not do anything saying they do not see any issue and they said they cannot reproduce the issue.

Despite my numerous reports to both Honda and dealership, only two times have they documented as requested.    The past 8 months it has been occurring more frequently and has become increasingly difficult to restart.   The past two times, I have been in a location with high speed limits so traffic approaching from the rear was coming at high speeds.  The first of these recent incidents,  it took 6 attempts to restart the vehicle and the second time I lost count.   These situations were terrifying to the point I am no longer wanting to keep this vehicle.   I can't help but consider if I have children in the back and am rear ended.    The dealer has repeatedly told me there are no codes, so they can't identify the source of the issue.

Whenever the car is stopped either at a light or in a traffic on road, highway exit ramps, the auto engine idle feature shuts of the car upon pressing the breaks fully. However once the break is released the car get stalled by automatically switching the car to Neutral with message on the screen asking to put the car in Park mode. A number of warning messages show up on the center console as well. Things like, Collision Mitigation Braking System, Road Departure Mitigation, Brake System warnings start displaying. Once car is put in the park mode, it says press break and start button to start the car but car will NOT start for about 30 seconds to 1 minutes.   This stalling creates extremely dangerous situation when you are on busy road with a risk of getting hit from behind. I have taken several videos of this incidence happening and shown it to dealership who has taken a stand as they can't fix the issue as they are unable to replicate. I have taken car multiple times to dealership for this issue and also reported the issue to Honda as well however I have been told that they cannot replicate the issue and thus unable to fix it. Unless the car is used like a daily driver I am afraid they will never be able to reproduce the issue and this creates a big safety hazard for me and my family. Stalling car in middle of road has left us in panic situation multiple times and it also possesses inherent risk to others driving on the road especially during night time .   After googling about this issue I have noticed many other people having the same issue. Honda needs to make recall on these cars and MUST get this rectified immediately. Please note my car still has extended warranty and Honda has not been able to identify and fix the issue. I request you to look into this and many others who possibly have reported same issue.",

At that point, the car engine restarts. Since owning this car, I have reported to the dealer the issue with the auto idle which is a clicking sound and the radio cutting out when the car restarts. That issue has accelerated from clicking to the engine stalling to the car completely shutting down and having difficulty restarting. I have had this occur in traffic in an intersection twice and it was quite frightening and dangerous to say the least. Honda has not been able to repair this issue and the only solution they can offer is for me to manually disable the feature upon starting the car - this is not a safe solution. Please force Honda to solve this issue. I am now worried that my safety is at issue when the car stalls in traffic.",

She almost cause a chain reaction accident because she panicked when the car would not respond to her acceleration.  In both instances, all the warning lights on the dashboard light up and the car goes into limp mode. The first incident, Honda updated the transmission software, after about 8-months later, Honda service found a DTC P0369 code and now want $2500 dollars for repairs. They want to replace the CMP sensor, Cam Shaft, Cam Shaft Thrust Cover, Valve Cover Gasket and Camshaft Seal! Why would a 2016 need a new Camshaft? There has to be a design issue with the engine, I would call this a premature failure of a critical part. Since this causes the engine to shut down, at any given time, the car cannot be driven until the camshaft is replaced.  All I want is to have Honda make things right, a car with 76,000 miles should never have engine surgery like this, period! I render the Honda Pilot from 2016 to 2021 unsafe to drive, the engine has not changed, I wonder if they fixed the camshaft problem on later models? If so, they know there is a design issue.",

This happens from time to time, but not every time. There is a known issue about the Honda Pilot 2016 having major transmission issues where it makes the vehicle jerky when accelerating. Yes, we can provide the vehicle for inspection.

It is a struggle to get up to speed when it feels like the Pilot is losing power. Also, once I backing up into the parking spot, the Pilot was making jerking movements and I could have damaged the cars that were parked behind me if I didn't throw the Pilot into neutral. Overall, it is a safety concern for my family of six.    3| The Honda dealerships seem to be aware of the issue but will not do anything about it. They recommend a transmission flush and computer repair/upgrade but are not willing to guarantee it will fix the issue. Others online have reported that the flush and computer repair did not fix the problem. We called Honda of America directly about the problem and were not willing to help us out.

No  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  All lights come on instantaneously before the vehicle completely does.  The vehicle must be placed in park and takes as long as 30 seconds to restart.  Again, in the middle of the highway H1 on Oahu.",

        "summary": "The components that have failed are the fuel injectors and catalytic converter. This is according to the Honda dealerships diagnostics. Whenever I press the gas the car hesitates, shudders, shakes, and wont accelerate. This has been an ongoing issue for the past 4 years when the car was 1 year old. It has gradually become worse.My children's safety as well as my safety are put at risk every time I drive. But one example was when I was entering the highway, I tried to speed up and couldn't and almost crashed with another car because my car wasn't functioning correctly and I wasnt able to merge correctly. The dealership has confirmed the issue but wont take responsibility on fixing it. They want me to pay out of pocket. No it has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, etc. At first there were no warning lamps, but there was a slight hesitation. Eventually, when the car started getting worse, the emissions light as well as check engine light came on. Took it it to the dealership and they got Catalytic converter P0430 error code. However, the dealership kept saying it was fuel injectors issue since it was no longer under warranty and they wanted me to pay for it. Fuel injector warranty is covered until 36k miles and I was at 60k miles.I did replace the fuel injectors with a different mechanic and that didn't fix the problem. Still drove the same. Now that I am over 100k miles on my vehicle, they are saying it's the catalytic converter because that warranty ran out at 80k miles and I would have to pay for it. I am not the only 2016 Honda Pilot owner having these issues and Honda is aware of it but wont take responsibility for it. I cannot afford to get a new car. This year model came out faulty and Honda has made bulletins regarding the issue, but wont cover the cost to fix the cars. They should be held responsible.",

I was able to engage hazard flashers and restart car.  Second time  I  was at red light released brake and car died.  Followed same procedure and got car restarted.  This has happened twice in last two weeks  My car is now in the shop .  When researching on line this seems to be a common problem.",

I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR LESS THAN 2000 MILES SINCE I PURCHASED IT.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE STALLING ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES EACH BEING PROGRESSIVELY MORE ACUTE THAN THE PREVIOUS.  I FIRST REPORTED THIS TO LONG BEACH HONDA AT MY SERVICE APT ON 10/15/2020.   AT THAT TIME THE ISSUE WAS A HESITATION WHEN THE AUTO IDLE WOULD ENGAGE AT A RED LIGHT, IT WOULD START AFTER A SECOND OR TWO OF DELAY.  TO COPE, WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE HABIT OF USING THE AUTO-OFF BUTTON BELOW THE GEAR SELECTOR.  HOWEVER, THE LAST TWO TIME I HAVE FILLED UP FUEL AND GOT IN TO DRIVE OFF I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO 'PUSH THE BUTTON.' TODAY I FORGOT TO PUSH THE BUTTON AND ALMOST GOT HIT BY ANOTHER CAR, WHEN MY CAR STALLED AND REFUSED TO START BACK UP.  I NOTICED IN THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS WERE ACTIVATED AND THE CAR GEAR SELECTOR WENT TO NEUTRAL.  THE DANGER WAS I WAS ON A DOWN HILL SLOP AND ROLLED INTO TRAFFIC AS I MISSED MY WINDOW TO PULL OUT HAD MY CAR STARTED UP PROPERLY.  THE DASH DISPLAYED THE PUSH BRAKE AND PUSH START MESSAGE.  THAT DID NOTHING.  I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK USING THE PARK BUTTON AND THEN OPEN MY DRIVERS SIDE DOOR.  AFTER I CLOSED THE DOOR THE CAR BEHAVED NORMAL AND STARTED WITHOUT ISSUE.  I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY, THAT THE DRIVER HEADING AT MY DOOR WAS AWARE ENOUGH TO MITIGATE A MUCH WORSE TURN OF EVENTS.  I WILL AGAIN REPORT THIS TO LONG BEACH HONDA WHEN THEY OPEN ON MONDAY. SEARCHING THE WEB I FOUND A NUMBER OF OTHER MODEL OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RESOLUTION PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS VEHICLE.

AND WHEN I GOT ON THE FREEWAY, DRIVING AT ABOUT 55MPH, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AND I HAD TO EMERGENTLY COAST OVER PAST THE FAST LANE INTO A NARROW INSIDE SHOULDER. I HAD MY YOUNG CHILDREN AND ELDERLY PARENTS IN THE CAR AND IT WAS A VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE FOR US. WE WERE THANKFUL ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND GET OFF THE FREEWAY WITH THE CAR SHUTTING OFF TWO MORE TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET WHILE DRIVING AT SLOW SPEEDS (10-20 MPH) BEFORE ARRIVING AT A GAS STATION PARKING LOT. THE DISPLAY CYCLED THROUGH MANY ERROR MESSAGES IE EMISSION SYSTEMS PROBLEM, POWER STEERING SYSTEM PROBLEM, TRANSMISSION SYSTEM PROBLEM, EMISSIONS SYSTEM PROBLEM, HILL START ASSIST PROBLEM, ETC. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE GOT CONTINUED TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.",

ONCE THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN FOR TRAFFIC TO MOVE, I RELEASE THE BRAKE AND THE IDLE STOP SYSTEM TRIES TO ENGAGE AND TURN THE ENGINE ON AGAIN, BUT FAILS AND SHUTS THE WHOLE VEHICLE DOWN, INOPERABLE. THE LIGHTS FLASH AND I CANNOT TURN THE CAR ON AGAIN FOR AT LEAST 1 TO 2 MINUTES. VEHICLES ARE HONKING AND TRAFFIC IS BLARING ACROSS US, BUT I CANNOT TURN THE VEHICLE BACK ON. AFTER 2 MINUTES, I CAN RESTART THE VEHICLE BY PUSHING THE BUTTON AND BRAKE AND THEN THE VEHICLE MOVES. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, SINCE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WIL LOL HAPPEN, BUT IT HAS ALWAYS HAPPENED WHILE IN HEAVY TRAFFFIC OR A BUSY INTERSECTION. IN 2019, I TOOK VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE, THEY SAID IT WAS A BAD BATTERY. I REPLACED THE BATTERY IN MARCH 2019. THE SAME IDENTICAL PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED TO OCCUR MULTIPLE TIMES. NOVEMBER 10 TOOK THE SAME DEALER, HOWDY HONDA, AUSTIN,TX. THEY AGAIN TOLD ME THE BATTERY WAS READING BAD, BUT I HAD THE BATTERY TESTED AT ANOTHER SHOP AND AT THE PLACE OF PURCHASE, AND THE BATTERY WAS MORE THEN FINE AND TESTED GREAT IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALER OF COURSE SAID THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE ISSUE AND DID NOT SEE ANYTHING WHEN THEY TESTED THE SYSTEM. THEY JUST PAWNED IT OFF ON THE BATTERY, EVEN THOUGH THE BATTERY IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD AND TESTING JUST FINE.  THERE IS NO WAY TO PERMANENTLY DISABLE THE SYSTEM AND IF I FORGET TO PUSH THE IDLE STOP DISENGAGE BUTTON EVERY TIME I START THE VEHICLE, I COULD END UP ON THE ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND SOME DRIVER DECIDES NOT TO PAY ATTENTION AND RUN INTO ME AND MY DISABLED VEHICLE.

THEY SAID THERE WERE NO RECALLS AND THEY CHANGE MY SPARK PLUGS AND TOLD ME TO DRIVE MY CAR ON AT LEAST A HALF TANK OF GAS. PROBLEM CONTINUED AND THEN MY CAR STARTED RUNNING ROUGH AND IDLING ROUGHER. I BROUGHT IT IN AGAIN AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY FUEL INJECTORS. THAT WAS TAKEN CARE AND I STILL HAVE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATES ALONG WITH EMISSIONS SYSTEM PROBLEM WARMING AND MY CAR STILL RUNS ROUGH AND HAS TROUBLE ACCELERATING.

I HAVE OVER A100K ON THE CAR WHICH I UNDERSTAND CAN CAUSE WEAR AND TEAR BUT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS FAR EXCEED THE DEFINITION OF NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS A RECALL ON ANYTHING AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO REMEDY THESE SITUATIONS. MY CAR IS AT SERVICE YET AGAIN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS CAUSING IT TO RUN SO ROUGH.

MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN NOTICING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION GETTING WORSE SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW. WHEN DRIVING THE CAR IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA (APPROX. 25 MPH), THE CAR SUDDENLY \"LURCHED/JERKED\" FORWARD WITH SOME FORCE WHEN WE WERE SLOWING DOWN TO A POSTED STOP SIGN. THIS WAS A HUGE ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT PEOPLE WERE CROSSING RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. AFTER THIS, WE PROCEEDED TO HEAD HOME. AGAIN THE CAR BEGAN TO \"JERK/LURCH\" FORWARD WHEN WE ATTEMPTED TO PERFORM A SLOW SPEED NORMAL STOP, CAUSING US TO ALMOST REAR END THE VEHICLES IN FRONT OF US. LASTLY, BEFORE GETTING HOME, DURING THE PILOT'S ACCELERATION FROM A STOPPED POSITION, BETWEEN THE 1-4 GEARS, THE CAR AGAIN WOULD EITHER JERK FORWARD UNPREDICTABLY OR NOT EVEN SHIFT INTO GEAR PROPERLY, LEAVING THE CAR WITH NO POWER TO GET MOVING. NOW IF THIS WASN'T ENOUGH TO WANT SOMEONE TO TAKE THEIR CAR IN, ON 3/16/2020, MY WIFE WAS BACKING THE CAR OUT OF OUR GARAGE. WHEN SHE SHIFTED THE TRANSMISSION INTO REVERSE, THE ENTIRE ENGINE/FRONT END OF THE CAR VIOLENTLY SHUTTERED (ASSUMED IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION DRIVE ASSEMBLY) AND WOULD NOT SHIFT PROPERLY TO REVERSE. THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS BEGAN TO LIGHT UP THE DASH ALONG WITH OTHER ELECTRICAL WARNING LIGHTS. WE EVENTUALLY GOT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED IT AND THEY ARE INDICATING TO US THAT IT IS A TRANSMISSION MODULE REPAIR/RE-CALIBRATION THAT NEEDS SOFTWARE UPDATES AS WELL. NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THESE REPAIRS AS WE HAVE BEEN INDICATING TO OUR HONDA DEALERSHIP THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION SINCE WE BOUGHT THE CAR, BUT THEY ASSURED US OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM OR FIND ANYTHING WRONG, UNTIL NOW, WHEN OUR WARRANTY EXPIRED.

HONDA AMERICA SAID THERE IS NO RECALL ON IT AND THAT THE 3 YEAR 36K WARRANTY IS OVER. I AM AWARE OF THOSE, BUT A 3 YEAR OLD HONDA SHOULD NOT NEED THIS REPLACEMENT. THEY ARE RESEARCHING IF THEY SHOULD ASSIST WITH THE COST OF THE REPAIR, AND WILL GET BACK TO ME IN A FEW DAYS.

IT CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 33000 MILES. BATTERY IS FINE. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH IT UNTIL MAYBE IN THE LAST YEAR I'VE NOTICED IT WOULD TAKE TAKE LONGER TO START AFTER RELEASING THE BRAKES TO NOW IT ACTUALLY COMPLETELY STALLS WHILE AT A COMPLETE STOP IN TRAFFIC, STOP SIGN, STOP-LIGHT OR WHEN YOUR TURNING  IN FRONT OF INCOMING TRAFFIC!! THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE OFTEN THAT I NOW TRY TO ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISABLE THE STOP-START SYSTEM MANUALLY WHEN I INITIALLY START THE CAR. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS SINCE THE CAR WOULD COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY DURING TRAFFIC, STOP LIGHTS AND STOP SIGNS AND STARTING THE CAR BACK UP REQUIRES SEVERAL TRIES. WHEN IT HAPPENS , THE CAR MAKES A POPPING SOUND LIKE IT WANTS TO START, THEN ALL THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS TURNS ON AND THEN THE RADIO TURNS OFF AND THE CAR COMPLETELY TURNS OFF!!.TRYING TO START THE CAR BACK UP IS NOT IMMEDIATE AND REQUIRES SEVERAL TRIES WHILE PEOPLE BEHIND US ARE HONKING THEIR HORNS LIKE CRAZY TO MAKE YOU MOVE.

IF THE BATTERY HASN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO RECHARGE, THE CAR MIGHT STALL AND NEED TO BE COMPLETELY SHUTDOWN, WAIT A WHILE AND MAYBE WILL RESTART. WE BOUGHT OUR CAR IN LATE 2015.  THE ISSUE PRESENTED ITSELF BY 2016/2017, MOSTLY AS BRIEF BLIPS AND THE CAR WOULD RESTART.  IN SUMMER 2018, AFTER REPEATED VISITS TO HONDA AND NUMEROUS TIMES OF THE CAR COMPLETELY STALLING AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS, WE CHOSE TO REPLACE THE BATTERY.  OUR HONDA SERVICE CENTERS KEPT TELLING US THAT THE BATTERY TESTS SHOWED IT WAS FINE AND THAT THE FEATURE ISN'T SUPPOSE TO ENGAGE IF THE BATTERY DOESN'T HAVE \"ENOUGH JUICE\" TO RESTART.  BUT CLEARLY, THAT DOESN'T WORK, BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD INDEED COMPLETELY STALL AND NEED TO TRY TO RESTART.  I ONCE HAD TO WAIT FIVE MINUTES STUCK AT A LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A 3 LANE ROAD, AND MY CAR FINALLY RESTARTED.  BUT ONCE WE PAID TO REPLACE THE BATTERY (THAT SUPPOSEDLY WAS FINE), THE CAR DIDN'T BLIP OR STALL.  BUT ONE YEAR LATER, IT STARTED HAPPENING AGAIN.  SOMETIMES THE CAR WILL JUST BLIP, WHERE ALL THE LIGHTS, RADIO AND AIR CONDITIONING WILL BRIEFLY CUT OUT AND THEN COME BACK ON AS THE FEATURE RE-ENGAGES THE ENGINE.

A FEW MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD AND MY CAR STARTED HAVING SHIFTING PROBLEMS AGAIN.

ON SUNDAY 26/AUG/2018 WHILE DRIVING AT AROUND 30-35 MPH, THE CAR SUDDENLY LOST POWER AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP ALMOST LIKE THE BRAKES HAD BEEN APPLIED (DID NOT NOTICE THE ORANGE BRAKE SIGN OR THE COLLISION WARNING BEEP SOUND). I WAS ON THE RIGHT LANE WITH NO ONE BEHIND OR AHEAD OF ME AND NO OBSTACLES IN FRONT. TURNED ON THE HAZARD LIGHT AND THEN NOTICED THAT THE VSA LIGHT WAS ON. CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AND JUST KEPT REVVING WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND THEN IN DRIVE, NO CHANGE. PUSHED THE VSA BUTTON TO TURN OFF VSA AND BOTH THE VSA LIGHT AND THE VSA OFF LIGHT STAYED ON BUT THE CAR WOULD STILL NOT MOVE. SHUT DOWN THE CAR AND RESTARTED IT AFTER WHICH THE LIGHTS WENT OFF, AND THE CAR STARTED MOVING (ALTHOUGH SLOWLY). DROVE HOME WITH VSA TURNED OFF AND AT A SPEED OF AROUND 20-30 MPH. THE ABRUPT BRAKING/STOPPING WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS AND WOULD HAVE CAUSED A COLLISION EVEN IN REGULAR TRAFFIC ON ANY OTHER DAY.  NOTE: THE KEY FOB WAS LOW ON BATTERY AND THE ONLY OTHER WARNING I HAD ON THE CONSOLE WAS ONE INFORMING ABOUT THE KEY FOB BATTERY BEING LOW.",

THE FIRST INCIDENT HAPPENED ABOUT A MONTH AGO BEFORE THE VEHICLE EVEN HAD 900 MILES ON IT AND IT HAS RE-OCCURRED NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE THEN AND WE ONLY HAVE 2,000 MILES ON IT.     IT APPEARS THAT IF YOU DECELERATE RATHER QUICKLY FROM LET'S SAY 50 MPH+ TO ZERO, THAT WHEN YOU RE-START FROM ZERO, THE TRANSMISSION IS ALL OUT OF SORTS.  WHEN YOU HIT THE GAS AT ZERO (AFTER THE FAST DECELERATION) THE VEHICLE WILL BE VERY HESITANT/SLOW TO START (ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE STARTING IN A HIGHER GEAR THAN 1ST) AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO ABOUT 25-30 MPH, THE VEHICLE WILL SLAM INTO THAT GEAR AND SHAKE THE ENTIRE VEHICLE.  THAT 'SLAMMING INTO GEAR' ISSUE WILL CONTINUE EVERY TIME YOU DROP DOWN OR ACCELERATE TO THAT 25-30 MPH RANGE DURING THAT DRIVING SESSION.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE ISSUE TO STOP DURING THAT DRIVING SESSION, IS TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND RE-START THE ENGINE.  IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT RESETS THE TRANSMISSION OR THE COMPUTER THAT RUNS THE TRANSMISSION'     THERE ARE NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS/WARNINGS THAT COME ON AND IT'S A HARD ISSUE TO DUPLICATE, BUT THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO MAKE IT OCCUR SOMETIMES IS FAST DECELERATION FROM A HIGH SPEED DOWN TO ZERO (I.E. COMING OFF AN OFF-RAMP AND HITTING A STOP LIGHT, OR DRIVING ON A 50MPH TYPE ROAD AND THEN HITTING A STOP LIGHT).    THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR TRANSMISSION FLAW AND THE CONTINUED \"SLAMMING INTO GEAR\" WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURS, CAN ONLY BE DOING MORE DAMAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION AND FEELS LIKE THE ENGINE IS ON THE VERGE OF LOCKING UP.  *TR",

THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED IN MAY 2016 ON A BUSY CITY STREET WITH OUR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE CAR.  WHILE IN MOTION, THE CAR ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN WITH THE DISPLAY SCREEN SHOWING A SERIES OF WARNINGS INDICATING NUMEROUS SYSTEM FAILURES.  THERE WAS NO ENGINE POWER BUT LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO COAST THE VEHICLE TO A NEARBY PARKING LOT.  THE DEALER INDICATED THERE WAS NO PROBLEM, JUST A COMPUTER GLITCH, AND THE ONLY REPAIR NECESSARY WAS TO RESET THE COMPUTER/SOFTWARE. THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED LAST WEEK, ONLY THIS TIME WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY.  WE COMPLETELY LOST ALL ENGINE POWER BUT LUCKILY I WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE AND I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE AND PULL OVER ON THE SHOULDER.  IF I HAD BEEN IN THE FAST OR MIDDLE LANE WITH LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OVER, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS COLLISION.  SIMILAR TO THE FIRST INCIDENT, WE WERE UNABLE TO START THE CAR WITH THE WARNING LIGHTS SHOWING VARIOUS SYSTEM FAILURES.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE SAME DEALER WHO INITIALLY INDICATED THEY WOULD JUST REBOOT THE SOFTWARE AGAIN.  SO WE PRESSED UPON THEM TO DO A MORE THOROUGH DIAGNOSIS SINCE THIS IS THE SECOND TIME ITS HAPPENED.  THEY AGREED TO KEEP THE VEHICLE AND SEEK TO IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  AT THIS POINT NO DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN MADE.  WE WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM A NEAR BRAND NEW (PURCHASED IN DECEMBER 2015 AND CURRENTLY HAS ONLY 9,200 MILES) PILOT ELITE LOADED WITH SAFETY AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES.  AGAIN WE EXPERIENCED TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS WHERE THE CAR IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN WHILE IN MOTION WITH THE MOST RECENT OCCURRING ON THE FREEWAY.  AND BOTH TIMES OUR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN WERE IN THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK AND I CERTAINLY HOPE HONDA DOES ITS DUE DILIGENCE IN DIAGNOSING AND ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.",

I WAS DRIVING MY CAR IN THE NORMAL MODE (ACC AND LKAS DISABLED) ON A NORMAL TWO LANE PAVED ROAD WHEN THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME MADE A SLOW RIGHT TURN.  I WAS NOT FOLLOWING VERY CLOSELY AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP ON MY OWN TO AVOID RUNNING INTO THE OTHER CAR.  I STOPPED ABOUT 15 FEET AWAY FROM THE OTHER CAR.  THE OTHER CAR THEN COMPLETED THE TURN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE OTHER CAR WAS NO LONGER IN THE WAY OF ME DRIVING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  WHEN I PUSHED THE GAS TO THEN PROCEED THE COLLISION MITIGATION SYSTEM STARTED FLASHING THE \"BRAKE\" MESSAGE AND PRODUCING AN AUDIBLE WARNING.  AT THIS POINT I WAS POSSIBLY GOING 10 MPH AGAIN. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY NOT ANYTHING IN MY WAY, I KEPT APPLYING THE GAS.  MY CAR THEN STARTED BRAKING ON ITS OWN, AT WHICH POINT I PUSHED THE GAS HARDER TO PRESUMABLY OVER-RIDE THE BRAKING.  A MOMENT OR TWO LATER, MY CAR THEN MADE A SUDDEN AND HARD BRAKE ON ITS OWN THAT BROUGHT MY CAR TO A COMPLETE STOP, DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WAS PUSHING HARD ON THE GAS.  THE OTHER CAR THAT HAD TURNED WAS WELL CLEAR OF THE LANE BY THIS POINT, AND WAS EASILY 1 FT AWAY FROM MY PATH OF TRAVEL WHEN I STARTED ACCELERATING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  MY ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT THE COLLISION MITIGATION SYSTEM WAS CONFUSED BY THE LACK OF A SHOULDER LANE MARKER (ONLY A RAISE CEMENT CURB WAS PRESENT) AND SOMEHOW THOUGHT THE CAR WAS STILL IN THE \"ROAD.\"  IN EITHER CASE, THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONED TO THE POINT THAT MY CAR WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO A COMPLETE STOP, AND THE CAR BEHIND ME VERY NEARLY REAR-ENDED ME IN A SITUATION WHERE I HAD ALREADY COME TO A STOP, AND THE OBSTACLE IN FRONT OF ME HAD CLEARED / CONTINUED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE CLEAR OF MY PATH.

WERE MET WITH TEPID RELUCTANCE AND A CAVALIER NEGLECTFUL ATTITUDE.     1.AT HIGH SPEEDS (55-75 MPH) THE VEHICLE OVERSTEERS AND DURING EMERGENCY AVOIDANCE MANEUVERS BECOMES UNSTABLE. TWICE WHILE AVOIDING DEAR ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS, I HAVE ALMOST LOST CONTROL AND WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT ROLLING THE VEHICLE OVER. I OWN AND HAVE DRIVEN A 2003 PILOT FOR OVER 180,000 MILES AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS SORT OF ISSUE. I BELIEVE THE SUSPENSION IS INCORRECTLY DESIGNED AND THAT UNEXPECTED AND UNNECESSARY ROLLOVERS ARE IMMINENT.  2.THE 'AUTO IDLE OFF' FEATURE TURNS THE ENGINE COMPLETELY OFF AT CERTAIN TIMES AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT TAKES BETWEEN 900 AND 1,300 MILLISECONDS TO RECOVER POWER TO THE WHEELS WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  UNLIKE HYBRID VEHICLES (FROM WHICH THIS FEATURE WAS TAKEN), THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE ELECTRICAL MOTOR TO PROVIDE TORQUE TO THE DRIVETRAIN WHILE THE ENGINE RESTARTS AND AS A RESULT, THERE IS DELAY IN ACCELERATING. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES, THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE HOWEVER IN A SMALL FRACTION THIS DELAY INCREASES THE RISK OF COLLISION. ABOUT ONCE PER WEEK, I EXPERIENCE A DELAY IN ENTERING DENSE TRAFFIC WITHIN SHORT INTERSTATE MERGE LANES. THIS DELAY OF ABOUT ONE SECOND IS ENOUGH TO REMOVE MY MARGIN OF ERROR AND INCREASES THE RISK OF COLLISION DURING A MERGING MANEUVER. WHILE THERE IS A SWITCH TO DEFEAT THIS FEATURE, IT RESETS EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF AND REMEMBERING TO OVERRIDE IT EVERY TIME IS INCONSISTENT WITH HUMAN MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE.",

THE FORCE BROKE THE REAR WINDOW WIPER AND BENT THE WINDOW WIPER ARM DOWN.  ALL THIS OCCURRED WHILE I WAS TRAVELLING ABOUT 5 TO 10 MILES AN HOUR.  THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE GARAGE, BUT NOT FAR FROM IT.  NO ONE WAS AROUND THE CAR.   MY HUSBAND WAS IN THE BACK YARD AND HEARD THE EXPLOSION. OUR HONDA DEALER SAID WE PRESSED THE WIPER INTO THE WINDOW CAUSING PRESSURE WHICH BROKE THE WINDOW.  I WAS DRIVING ALONE IN THE CAR. IF ANYONE HAD BEEN BEHIND THE VEHICLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SHREDDED BY FLYING GLASS.  IT DIDN'T DROP TO THE GROUND IT FLEW 15 FEET BEHIND THE CAR. THIS PRESENTS A DANGEROUS SITUATION IF PEOPLE ARE NEARBY AS ON A CITY STREET OR PARKING LOT.  FROM THE INTERNET I SEE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY OTHER VEHICLE MAKERS, NOT JUST HONDA.",
