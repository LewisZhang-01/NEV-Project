I pulled over to side of road and slept in car till the rain stopped. Prior to this I backed into a fence when the steering failed backing into a carport resulting in body damage to front end under left headlight.  Months before I had asked the Chevy dealership to diagnose issue and they found nothing wrong as in the beginning the car would still steer at its own leisure. The light didn't come on when they looked at it. After the night in the rain I have taken the fuse outta the power steering part and just manually steer. This should be replaced as it is a common issue to ALL HHR. Mine isn't covered as it is an SS but clearly it should be covered by a recall. Hopefully I don't die before this is taken care of.",

I'M AT THE POINT WHERE I WILL BE DOING A SHADE-TREE-MECHANIC REPAIR IN LIEU OF WAITING ON NHTSA.    GM (CHEVROLET) HAVE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR 100 YEARS. THE COMPANY KNOWS MANY VEHICLES ARE DRIVEN IN RUST BELT STATES. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR FITTING CHEAP UN-COATED MILD STEEL FUEL AND PURGE LINES TO VEHICLES THAT OPERATE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.     NOTE THAT THIS VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON. THE CODE IS FOR A PURGE SYSTEM LEAK. I HAVE FOUND THAT THE PURGE LINE RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE FUEL LINE IS JUST AS CORRODED AS THE FUEL LINE. THIS IS LIKELY WHERE THE PURGE SYSTEM LEAK RESIDED.

SAID THE POWER STEERING ASSIST WAS.BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $189. HE WENT ON TO SAY THERE WILL BE A RECALL AND I WOULD BE REIMBURSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN IT WOULD COME.  PICKED UP CAR TODAY AND CHARGE FOR REPAIR WAS $230 AND TODAY SAID WILL NOT BE RECALLED AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED.

TWO MONTHS AGO BEFORE I COULD GET IT INTO THE SHOP TO REPLACE THE ROTORS I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE DOING ABOUT 5 MPH WHEN I HEARD A GRINDING NOISE. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT THE SHOP, 50 MILES AWAY, TO FIND OUT THAT A BRAKE PAD WAS COMPLETELY MISSING!!! APPARENTLY THE WARPED ROTOR UNEVEN SURFACE JERKED THE BRAKE PAD OUT OF ITS SETTING AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS MISSING. THE MECHANIC HAD TO DO A COMPLETE BRAKE (FRONT) JOB USING THE BEST ROTORS ON THE MARKET 2 MONTHS AGO AND IN LESS THAN 1 MONTH, WITH NO HEAVY BRAKING, THE BRAKES ARE ONCE AGAIN SHOWING SIGNS THAT THE ROTORS ARE WARPED---STEPPING ON THE BRAKES IT IS JERKING ONCE AGAIN, AND NOW THEY ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THEY WERE WHEN I TOOK THEM IN TO GET REPAIRED. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION  ESPECIALLY REALIZING THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER BRAKE PAD COMING OFF WHEN I STEP ON THE BRAKE.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FINALLY TODAY. THE DEALER CALLED ME AND SAID, \"GOOD NEWS THIS PART IS COVERED.\" I SAID GREAT! THEN HE CALLED BACK 30 MINUTES LATER WITH BAD NEWS, HE SAID THAT THE PART WAS COVERED IN CANADA ONLY! WHAT, NOT IN FLORIDA! THIS DOES NOT EVEN MAKE SENSE. LETS JUST SAY AFTER THAT PHONE CALL HE CHARGED ME FOR THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING MOTOR AT COST. MY TOTAL COST WAS $163.45 (PART #19257875). IF I COULD HAVE DONE IT MYSELF I WOULD HAVE. I JUST SAW THIS PART ON EBAY FOR $82.85 OR BETTER YET, IF IT WAS A RECALL IT COULD HAVE BEEN FREE. AFTER HIS EARLIER PHONE CALL THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO LET HIM CHARGE ME ANYTHING MORE. BUT, WHY AGAIN IS THIS PART NOT ON THE RECALL LIST FOR CHEVY HHRS. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS. I GUESS WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS AND SOMEBODY GETS SUED MAYBE THERE WILL BE A RECALL. SAD BUT TRUE.

TWO MONTHS AFTER WE GOT THE CAR WE HAD TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT ROTORS ON IT AND AFTER FIGHTING WITH GM THEY AGREED TO PAY FOR THE ROTORS. AT THIS TIME THEY TOLD US THAT THE CAR NEEDED NEW TIRES AND A FRONT END ALIGNMENT AT 26,000 MILES . THEN JUST TWO MONTHS AGO AT 61,000 MILES IT HAD A RUMBLING NOISE IN THE FRONT END ,THE DRIVETRAIN WAS STILL UNDER WARRENTY.THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE RIGHT SIDE AXLE BEARING WAS BAD AND THEY REPLACED IT,AND ALSO AT THIS TIME THEY TOLD US THAT THE LOWER BALL JOINT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST TO US OF OVER $400.00 . JUST LAST WEEK THE RUMBLING NOISE RETURNED , I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND THEY TOLD US THAT THIS THE LEFT AXLE BEARING WAS BAD, WARRANTY ALSO COVERED THIS REPAIR. ALSO THEY SAID THAT THE CAR NEEDED THE FRONT ROTORS TURNED AND NEW BRAKE PADS ON IT .MY WIFE HIT A POTHOLE ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND BENT THE WHEEL . COST TO REPLACE THE WHEEL WAS $150.00 . WHEN I ROTATED THE TIRES AS PER GMS ADVICE I NOTICED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT STRUT WAS LEAKING ,AND AS WELL AS THE LEFT REAR SHOCK ABSORBER. THE ONLY THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR WAS ITS LOOKS. SO NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO BUY A FORD FOCUS..  ITS NO WONDER GM HAD TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT BAIL THEM OUT... *TR",

I HAVE HAD IT IN THE DEALERSHIP TWICE. FIRST TIME THEY REPROGRAMMED THE ECM. PROBLEM CONTINUES AND THE SECOND TIME, I WAS TOLD THAT THE FACTORY SAYS THIS IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 2.0 ENGINE AND TURBO. THE DEALERSHIP GAVE ME A COPY OF SERVICE BULLETIN AND AT THE END ,IT STATES (DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPAIR OR REPLACE ANY PARTS FOR WHAT IS CONSIDERED NORMAL OPERATION OF THE OHB). BULLETIN NUMBER IS 07-05-22-002. THE SECOND BULLETIN NUMBER GIVE TO ME BY THE DEALERSHIP IS 08-05-22-001. THE FOLLOWING OPTIMIZED HYDRAULIC BRAKE (OHB) #1-RATCHET SOUND COMING FROM THE BRAKE SYSTEM DURING OHB ACTIVATION. #2-BRAKE PEDAL MOVEMENT OR PULSATION WHEN OHB IS ACTIVE. #3-INCREASED BRAKE PEDAL EFFORT UNDER LOW BRAKE BOOSTER VACUUM. #4-CHANGE IN BRAKE PEDAL EFFORT WHEN OHB IS ACTIVE. #5-FREQUENT BRAKE STOPS MAY RESULT IN OHB ACTIVATION. #6-HIGH ALTITUDE DRIVING MAY RESULT IN OHB ACTIVATION. THE WAY I READ ALL THIS IS WHEN OHB ACTIVATES, YOU MAY HAVE BRAKING PROBLEMS. I HAVE TALKED TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ALL I COULD GET OUT OF THEM WAS (THIS IS NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS  OF THE HHR WITH TURBO). THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED GM AND THEY SAY THE SAME THING AND THERE IS NOT A CURE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND IT IS NORMAL FOR THE TURBO MODELS. I GUESS WHEN A FEW PEOPLE GETS KILLED THEY MAY TRY TO FIND A FIX. MY VEHICLE NOW HAS LESS THAN 3000 MILES AND I NOTICED THE PROBLEM AROUND 100 OR SO MILES. I HAVE OWNED 25 GM VEHICLES IN MY DAYS AND THIS IS THE FIRST HAVING NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR NOT STOPPING. IF YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLY KILL SOMEONE, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO THE POLICE, WHEN THE POLICE GETS IN THE CAR AND THE OHB IS NOT ACTIVATED AND THE BRAKE PEDAL SEEMS NORMAL, YOU ARE IN TROUBLE AND MAY NEVER PROVE AT THAT TIME THE BRAKES HONESTLY DID FAIL. IF GM CAN,T FIX THE PROBLEM THEY SHOULD BUY THE CARS BACK.  *TR",
