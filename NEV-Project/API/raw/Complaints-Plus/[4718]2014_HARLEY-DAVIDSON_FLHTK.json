SUBSEQUENT TO THE PUBLICATION OF THIS MANUAL, SOME 2008-2011 HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE MODELS WERE INVOLVED IN AN NHTSA RECALL FOR ABS BRAKE ISSUES.

THE DIGITAL TECHNICIAN II ACTIVATES THE ABS MODULE DURING A BRAKE FLUID REPLACEMENT TO ENSURE ALL CONTIMANATED BRAKE FLUID IS FLUSHED FROM THE ABS MODULE AND BRAKE LINES.  AS I STATED, THE 2014 SERVICE MANUAL DOES NOT REQUIRE THIS STEP.  HARLEY-DAVIDSON ALLOWS OWNERS TO PURCHASE SERVICE MANUALS IN ORDER FOR OWNERS TO PERFORM THEIR OWN SERVICE AND REPAIRS TO THEIR HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLES WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE THE MOTORCYCLES TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE AND REPAIRS.

HOWEVER, I INSPECTED THE BIKE AND INFORMED THE DEALER THAT THE CLUTCH FLUID LOW. IT WAS BELOW THE SIGHT GLASS ON THE MASTER CYLINDER (ACUTELY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SIGHT GLASS). I WAS INFORMED THAT THE CYLINDER WAS FULL AND CANNOT BE FILLED TO THE SIGHTLINE BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN.    ON NOVEMBER 15, 2013 DRIVING 40 MILES FROM HOME AT 45 MPH WHEN I APPROACHED A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND STARTED TO DOWN SHIFT. SHIFTING BECAME HARDER AND HAD TROUBLE GETTING INTO LOWER GEARS. I TURNED AROUND AND HEADED FOR HOME CUTTING MY TRIP SHORT. WITHIN A FEW MORE MILES, I LOST ALL ABILITY TO SHIFT GEARS AND ALMOST HIT THE BACK OF A TRUCK STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO TURN INTO AN ABANDONED PARKING LOT AND STALL THE ENGINE TO STOP THE MOTORCYCLE. A PHONE CALL TO THE DEALER WAS MADE BY CELL PHONE AND THEY COULD NOT GET OUT TO PICK UP THE BIKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. THE AIR TEMPERATURE 41 DEGREES AND OUT IN THE OPEN. I TOOK A CHANCE AND KEPT PULLING/PUMPING THE CLUTCH HANDLE TO BUILD ENOUGH FLUID PRESSURE TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT GEARS AND DRIVE THE BIKE ALONG SIDE THE ROAD TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER.   DEALER/SERVICE STATED THEY RODE THE BIKE FIVE MILE AND HAD NO SHIFTING ISSUES. I EXPLAINED IF YOU PUMP THE LEVER YOU CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE BUILD AND THE CLUTCH WORKS. DEALER AGREED AS THEY PUMPED THE LEVER AND FELT THE SAME THING AND THAT WAS STRANGE. I REITERATED MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE FLUID LEVEL. IF THE BIKE PARKED ON A SLOP AND ON IT'S JEFFY STAND, THE LOW FLUID LEVEL COULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS AS THE CLUTCH WORE AND FLUID LEVEL DROPS. HD'S CLUTCH SERIOUS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.  *TR",

THIS RESULTED IN A NEAR MISS COLLISION FROM THE BIKE BEHIND ME IN THE GROUP (THERE WAS NO BRAKE LIGHT INDICATING I WAS DECELERATING).    THIS ISSUE RELATES DIRECTLY TO THE 2014 MY VEHICLES.  PREVIOUS YEAR HARLEY-DAVIDSON VEHICLES HAD THE CB RADIO PTT  CONTROL LOCATED ON THE LEFT HANDLEBAR CONTROLS AND POSED NO DANGER TO LOSING THROTTLE CONTROL WHILE OPERATING THE CB RADIO PTT CONTROL.  FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON, HARLEY-DAVIDSON CHOSE TO MOVE THE CB RADIO PTT CONTROL FROM THE LEFT HANDLEBAR CONTROLS WHERE IT HAD BEEN LOCATED SINCE THE CB RADIO OPTION HAS BEEN AVAILABLE, TO THE RIGHT HANDLEBAR CONTROLS FOR THE 2014 MODELS EQUIPPED WITH THE CB RADIO OPTION.    CB RADIO PTT OPERATION IS MORE THAN A MOMENTARY ACTIVATION, REQUIRING THE CONTROL TO BE DEPRESSED LONG ENOUGH TO COMPLETE A COMMUNICATION TRANSMISSION TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP RIDE, MANY TIMES WHILE ATTEMPTING TO UP-SHIFT, DOWNSHIFT, OR SIMPLY MAINTAIN CONSISTENT ROAD SPEED.  HAVING THE PTT CONTROL ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE THROTTLE CONTROL PRESENTS A SAFETY CONCERN IN THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE THROTTLE CONTROL WHILE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS DURING A GROUP RIDE WHERE RELAYING ROAD HAZARD OR DIRECTIONS INFORMATION IS A VITAL FUNCTION TO SAFE GROUP RIDING.  *TR",

ON THE NEW 2014 THE BUTTON WAS SWITCHED WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL BUTTON (WHICH WAS MOVED TO THE LEFT SIDE) AND MOVED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE CONTROL CLUSTER.  BECAUSE OF THIS AND THE NEED TO CONTINUALLY GRAB THE THROTTLE CONTROL, THE BUTTON IS NOT AS EASY TO REACH WHILE RIDING.  THE ON/OFF SWITCH FOR THE BIKE IS DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE THROTTLE GRIP.  BECAUSE OF THIS THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS VULNERABLE TO BEING HIT AND TURNING OFF THE BIKE WHILE IN MOTION, CAUSING A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  THIS HAPPENED AT LEAST 3 TIME DURING A RIDE ON THE ABOVE DATE AND CREATED SOME SCARY MOMENTS.  I HAD TO REDUCE USE OF THE CB AND CHANGE POSITIONS WITH A FELLOW RIDER TO LEAD THE GROUP AS I FELT IT WAS NO LONGER SAFE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OTHER RIDERS AND REAR ROAD CAPTAIN.  MY SUGGESTION IS TO REQUIRE HARLEY DAVIDSON TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND SWITCH THE WIRING BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS.  BOTH THE CRUISE CONTROL AND PUSH TO TALK ARE APPARENTLY THE SAME TYPE OF BUTTON (MY OPINION) IN THE WAY THEY OPERATE, SO IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF SWITCHING THE WIRES IN THE HARNESS.
