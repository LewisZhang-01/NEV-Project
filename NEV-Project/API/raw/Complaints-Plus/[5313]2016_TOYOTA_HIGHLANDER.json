THE TIRE PRESSURE ALARM NOTIFIED THE DRIVER OF TIRE PRESSURE LOSS FOR AN EMERGENCY STOP.

WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE I WAS FOLLOWING BEHIND MY WIFE DRIVING THE HIGHLANDER AT THE TIME. TRAVEL SPEED WAS BETWEEN 65 AND 70 MPH AT THE TIME. THE TIRES ARE THE ORIGINAL THAT CAME ON THE TOYOTA NEW AND HAD ABOUT 27000 MILES ON THEM. UPON INSPECTION OF THE TIRE IT LOOKS OBVIOUS THAT THE TIRE WAS DEFECTIVE DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF VISUAL CRUMBLED RUBBER ALL INSIDE THE TIRE SEPARATED FROM THE SIDEWALLS IN SIDE AND THE MASSIVE BLISTERS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRE, WE HAD ALL THE TIRES REPLACED ON THE VEHICLE AS WE HAD NO TRUST IN THE REST OF THE TIRES AFTER THIS HAPPENED. NEITHER THE TOYO TIRE MANUFACTURER REP., THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, OR THE TOYOTA COMPANY WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAILURE, OR OFFERED ANY CONCESSIONS AGAINST THE REPLACEMENT TIRES. PHOTOS OF THE TIRE AND OR THE TIRE ITSELF IS AVAILABLE FOR NHTSA IF THERE IS A REQUEST TO REVIEW. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE TOYO TIRE MANUFACTURER, THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP OR THE TOYOTA COMPANY IS QUITE OBVIOUS TO US THAT THEY HAD NO CONCERN FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE THE SAME TOYO TIRES THAT TOYOTA CHOOSE TO PUT ON THE NEW VEHICLE THAT MAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.

WE DROVE ON THE STREET FOR TWO MINUTES AND WE CAME TO A STOP LIGHT I BRAKED TO A COMPLETE STOP, AND THE CAR DIED.  THE DASH BOARD SCREEN SAID PUT YOUR CAR IN PARK AND START THE CAR.  IT WAS DARK AND MANY CARS WERE BEHIND ME, WAITING FOR ME TO START MY CAR.  WE WERE AFRAID THE CAR BEHIND US WOULD HIT US. MY DAUGHTERS WERE SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT, AND MY WIFE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  I PUT IT IN PARK, TRIED TO START.  BUT IT DID NOT, SO I PUMPED THE ACCELERATOR, THEN IT STARTED.  I DROVE ONTO THE FREEWAY ON RAMP, GOT ON THE 10 FWY HEADING EAST. TRAFFIC WAS GOOD AT FIRST, EVERYONE WAS GOING 60 MPH.  THEN SUDDENTLY, THE THE FREEWAY TRAFFIC WAS BUMPER TO BUMPER AND I HAD TO BRAKE TO SLOW DOWN QUICKLY.  WHEN I DID, THE CAR DIED ON ME AGAIN.  THE DASHBOARD SCREEN SAID TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND START MY ENGINE. NOW, WE ALL BEGAN TO PANIC BECAUSE THE CARS BEHIND US WERE GOING FAST, AND THEY MIGHT  SMASH INTO US.  WE WERE AFRAID WE WOULD  DIE OR BE BADLY INJURED BY THE COLLISION COMING.  LUCKILY THE CAR BEHIND ME STOPPED WITHOUT HITTING US. ONCE AGAIN, I PUT IT IN PARK, PUMPED MY ACCELERATOR, AND THE CAR STARTED. AT THIS POINT, I DECIDED, NO MATTER HOW SLOW THE FREEWAY TRAFFIC IS, I WILL L NOT BRAKE, BECAUSE IF I DO, THE CAR WILL STALL, AND WE CAN GET HIT BY THE CAR BEHIND US.  SO I DROVE VERY SLOWY UNTIL WE GOT OFF THE FREEWAY, AND ARRIVED HOME. AUGUST 2, 2016: 6:30AM I FILLED UP THE TANK AT THE SHELL GAS STATION NEAR MY HOUSE, BEING CAREFUL NOT TO OVERFILL IT.

THE BACKUP CAMERA DOES NOT CLEARLY SHOW REAR OBSTRUCTIONS WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED IN SHADE OR SHADOWS, OR THE DRIVER IS WEARING SUNGLASSES. THESE ARE MAJOR, CRASH INDUCING PROBLEMS, WHICH WE REPORTED TO TOYOTA TODAY.  WE NARROWLY AVOIDED TWO COLLISIONS BECAUSE WE DID NOT SEE VEHICLES APPROACHING US FROM THE SIDE FRONT OF OUR VEHICLE; AND WE NARROWLY AVOIDED BACKING INTO A PARKED CAR (IN SHADE) WHICH DID NOT CLEARLY SHOW UP ON THE BACKUP CAMERA.  TWO OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE IN PARKING AREAS; THE THIRD WAS DRIVING INTO A LEFT BEND ON A ROAD AS ANOTHER VEHICLE APPROACHED HEAD ON.
