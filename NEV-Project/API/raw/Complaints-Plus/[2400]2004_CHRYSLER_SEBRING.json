IT STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES IN THAT TRIP. WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER; THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. WE DROVE THE CAR SHORT DISTANCES SINCE, BUT RECENTLY STARTED TO DRIVE ABOUT 20 MILES ONE WAY, WHEN IT STARTED TO HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS. WE EXPERIENCE SEVERAL CASES OF SUDDEN STALLING, JERKING AND SUDDEN STOPS WHEN TURNING. IT HAPPENS WHEN HAVE TO STOP AFTER A HIGHWAY DRIVE.  IN ONE INSTANCE IT ALMOST HIT OUR HOUSE. WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND WERE TOLD THAT THE RIGHT DOWNSTREAM O2 SENSOR, AND THE HARNESS CONNECTOR HAVE TO BE REPLACED AND THE FUEL INJECTOR NEEDS TO BE SERVICED. ALSO THE POWER STEERING PUMP IS NOISY. CHRYSLER WOULD PAY FOR THE PARTS, BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO PICK UP THE LABOR COST OF $1,103, BECAUSE THE CAR HAS 47,000 MILES, IT IS SO FAR SINCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. THEY CLAIM THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE 70,000 MILES OR 7 YEARS WARRANTY. IT IS THE ENGINE AND/OR TRANSMISSION THAT ARE MALFUNCTIONING, BUT THEY TRY TO FIND DIFFERENT THINGS TO GIVE ME THE RUN AROUND AND NOT TO COVER THE EXPENSES. AFTER ALL, T REALLY THING THAT THIS WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, THIS IS ONLY THE EFFECT OF A DIFFERENT CAUSE, THAT IS NOT EVEN FOUND.  2. ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT ONCE IT RAINS, THE CARPET ON THE DRIVER SIDE IS ALWAYS WET.  3. A THIRD ISSUE, WE HAD TO REPLACE THE BLOWER MOTOR RESISTOR.  ALL COMMON PROBLEMS WITH THESE CARS, AS I READ COMPLAINTS.  WHY ISN'T CHRYSLER STEPPING UP AND FIXING THESE PROBLEMS? *TR",

I HAD TO HAVE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP ONLY FOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO SMART OFF AT MA AND TELL ME THAT IT WAS OUT OF GAS.

ALSO, WHEN I WAS HAVING TROUBLE ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE GAS GAUGE,BUT OF COURSE,THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM. THE CAR CUT OFF AGAIN AND I TOOK IT BACK,ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE GAS GAUGE AND THEN WAS TOLD THE SENDING UNIT IN THE GAS TANK WAS BAD,NOW THAT ITS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I HAVE TO PAY OVER 700.00 FOR THE PART TO BE REPLACED.

THEY ARE DENYING UNDER THE \"GUISE\" THAT THE OWNERS ARE NOT MAINTAINING THEIR VEHICLES.  THIS IS PURE HOGWASH, BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE MODELS BACK TO 1999.      IT IS EMBARRASSING THAT A CAR MANUFACTURER IS SO CHEAP THAT THEY CAN NOT ADMIT THEIR MISTAKE, COVER IT UNDER THE WARRANTY AND JUST BE DONE WITH IT.  I HAD MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE CAR, I AM GLAD THAT I DID NOT HAVE A TOTAL ENGINE FAILURE AND END UP IN THE DITCH OR REAR ENDED LIKE MANY OTHERS I HAVE READ ABOUT.  WHEN IT STALLED, LUCKILY THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME REALIZED THAT I WAS HAVING AN ISSUE AND GOT OVER TO THE OTHER LANE QUICK ENOUGH, THEY ONLY HONKED THEIR HORN AT ME, AS TO WHICH MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO KNOW WHY.    CHRYSLER SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES.  THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR CAR MANUFACTURERS, AUDI, TOYOTA, THAT HAVE HAD SIMILAR SLUDGE ISSUES AND THEY HAVE STEPPED UP AND  STARTED ENGINE REPLACEMENT, AND/OR REPAIR PROGRAMS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR MISTAKES.  EVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO HEAR ABOUT THIS, TO AVOID BUYING THIS TERRIBLE ENGINE AND THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS.

THE CAR IDLES BADLY, AND WHEN SLOWING DOWN AT A LIGHT OR WHILE U HAVE YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE, THE VEHICLE WILL JUMP FORWARD SUDDENLY! I ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE SO FAR. I HAVE 128 MILES ON MY CAR. AFTER READING SAME COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE, I AM AFFRAID THAT THE DEALER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIX THIS, WHICH IS PATHETIC THAT A 30000 DOLLAR CAR WOULD HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IS SO ANNOYING.    2. WHEN U ARE DECELLERATING WITH UR FOOT ON BRAKE TO STOP AT A STOP LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE, JUST BEFORE THE RPM NEEDLE REACHES TEH IDLE POINT AT \"1\" ALMOST.. IT WILL SUDDENLY GO BACK UP TO ABOUT 1.5 AND THEN COME BACK TO 1. I DONT KNOW IF ITS BAD GEAR SHIFTING BY TEH AUTOTRAN OR JUST BAD TIMMING ADJUSTEMENT? BUT ITS ANNOYING, CUZ IT MAKE TEH CAR JUMP A LITTLE IF YOU ARE SOFT BRAKING.    3). TWICE ALREADY THE ENGINE JUST DIES.. AND I THINK THSI IS RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS TWO PROBLEMS. I WAS BACKING UP IN MY PARKING AT HIME.. AND AS SOON AS I PUT GEAR IN REVERSE.. THE RPM SUDEENLY DROPPED.. AND EVENTUALLY ENGINE SHUT DOWN. SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I PULLED UP TO THE PARKING ENTRANCE AT WORK TO SHOW MY ACCESS CARD, AND WHEN I PUT IT IN P, THE RPM DROPPED CAUSING THE CAR TO STALL.    4). TRANSMISSION MAKES CLUNK SOUND SOMETIMES WHILE DRIVING WHEN CHANGING FROM N TO D. OR WHEN I DO A COLD START IN TEH MORNING AND THEN PUT TEH GEAR IN D, AS SOON AS I MOVE TEH CAR AN INCH.. IT MAKES THSI SOUND.. SOMETHIMES LOOKS LIEK COMING FROM TEH FRONT END NOT THE TRAN.. I DONNO WHAT THAT IS.

THE SERVICE MGR, DAVE TOMKO, TOLD ME HE WAS INVOLVED WITH THE CAR THE PREVIOUS DAY AND SAW NO PROBLEM. I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK ON OCT 9TH FOR DAVE TOMKO TO VISUALLY CONFIRM THE DEFECT VIA A ROAD TEST. HE TOLD ME THIS WAS NORMAL AND I HAD NO OTHER RECOURSE THAN TO SEEK ARBITRATION. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER'S CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER (REFERENCE # 11733597) AND HAVE BEEN BRUSHED OFF. THEY SIDED WITH DAVE TOMKO AND SEVERAL E-MAILS LATER, TOLD ME IF I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS NORMAL TO GO TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. I HAVE SINCE TAKEN THE CAR TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP (OCT 20TH). THEY AGREED IT WAS NOT NORMAL AND UPPED THE CURB IDLE SPEED (AS THE SHAKING BECAME MORE PROMINENT WHEN THE IDLE SPEED DROPPED).
