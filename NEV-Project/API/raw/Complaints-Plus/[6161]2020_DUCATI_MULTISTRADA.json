While personally investigating the problem I have found that this appears to be a common problem with this model of motorcycle and anecdotal reports indicate the manufacturer has developed an internal repair procedure to address this issue only after owners have reported it, which is after the potential safety issue has occurred.

        "summary": "The rear brake seems to be ineffective compared to other Ducati models I've owned. This condition has lead to depending on the front brakes more than the standard 70% due to the rears not performing their part. This has caused (In my humble opinion) the fronts to warp causing pulsing in the front brakes. This was noted with fewer than 1200 miles when first service was performed. Dealer noted nothing abnormal other then the sound of a horn (sounds like a trumpet) while rolling the bike at a walking pace. This issue became worse as I made my way across the country from San Fran to Sarasota Florida. Upon arrival with 3500 miles there is a notable pulsing from the front brake lever. Euro Cycles of Tampa took the bike in for warranty noting 6-9 thousandths runout. Ducati was provided this information and in return said I quote \"Rotors are excluded from the Ducati Limited Warranty Policy\". Under normal circumstances I can understand this policy but I believe there is an under lying issue being over looked here. If you look on any forum online there are numerous complaints of this very issue on the Multistrada from 2015-2020. Some of which Ducati \"decided\" to cover and some like mine they did not. For everyone coming after me I'd love to know what the root cause is. Oh By the way this is my 30th+ yr riding and probably 15th or 16th motorcycle and I've never had to replace rotors due to warping.",
