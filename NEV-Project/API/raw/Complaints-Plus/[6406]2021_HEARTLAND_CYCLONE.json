The contact stated that the RV was parked at a campground charging station when the contact noticed there was dark grey smoke coming from inside of the RV under the bar area in the vehicle. The contact unplugged the main power from the vehicle and removed the fireplace station where the smoke was coming from to see that the outlet plugs and outlet box connection were burnt. The contact had a technician at the site inspect the RV and diagnosed the failure as a faulty outlet box and needed to be replaced. The contact was concerned that the failure was caused due to water dripping from the sink next to the outlet box that caused the failure. The RV was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.",
