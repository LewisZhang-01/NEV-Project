If I go under any sort of bridge, no matter how short, the dash goes dark. Sometimes it takes over 10 minutes for it to go back to normal. The ambient light sensor should be facing straight up at the sky. Also, the sensor should be connected to the vehicles GPS and the clock for the time of day. I rely on the info center on the dash for the GPS and other items.  If I cannot see the info center, it can lead to a collision.  I have brought my vehicle to the dealer and they refuse to do anything. Also, during the day, I use prescription sunglasses while driving, so it makes it really difficult. Thank you.",

We (my wife and young daughters were with me) were within a few miles of a gas station so we decided to try to drive there to not be in the cold weather.  Before reaching a gas station, the car stalled and needed to be towed to a service shop.  The car was diagnosed with a blown rear main seal causing catastrophic engine failure.  It was determined the PCV valve froze causing excess crankcase pressure, blowing the rear main seal.  The Equinox had 89,277 miles on it at the time.  \"Tow\" costs:  $149.18    Engine Replacement Cost: $6504.30  At no point did any oil related (level, pressure) indicator appear.",

I had previously (about 2 days) noticed that there was a very minuscule delay in between the time from when I pressed on the accelerator to when the car would speed up, but was less than 1 second, so didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. During the traffic incident, all of the sudden, when I pressed on the accelerator to go from a mostly stopped position to advance forward, my Equinox completely stalled. It was like someone turned the car off, but still had the lights and stereo on. I had to put my car in park, turn the car totally off, and restart it, and place it into drive, in order for it to advance forward. The next time I had to slow down for traffic, I slowed almost to a stop, put my foot on the accelerator, and the car stalled again. Keep in mind, my car wasn\u2019t completely stopped at any of these times, so the cars behind me were caught off guard when I had to suddenly stop, put my car in park, turn it off, and then back on again, in order to move forward. This is dangerous during rush hour, on the most congested freeway in my state (which is where I live and was located). I was almost rear-ended multiple times. This occurred around 20 times before I could pull to the side. I called Chevrolet and they directed me the nearest dealership.  The problem was continuous until I arrived.  The issue was: Intake Camshaft Solenoid Control Circuit - Solenoid Internal Failure and they replaced Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid (part #12679099).   My car had 46,661 miles, and under warranty, but it appears to be a common problem.  There were ZERO warning/dash lights that warned me that something was wrong, and when the car died, I only knew because I would push the accelerator and it wouldn\u2019t move.  The dealership confirmed the issue, and I have the receipt from the replacement (covered under warranty), as well as a video of it occurring.
