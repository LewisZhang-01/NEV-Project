I was sitting in the parking spot for a few minutes while waiting to pick someone up when I hear a strange noise come from the car, not even a second later my car suddenly accelerated on its own without me pressing the gas pedal or touching anything.  I was completely caught off guard.  The car shot forward at such a rate of speed, so fast that it threw me back in my seat.  I suddenly reached to grab the steering wheel, and tried to take control of the wheel, but the steering wheel would not turn, it was completely locked.  I placed both feet on the brake pedal and pushed as hard as I could but the car would not stop.   It was like the car suddenly had a mind of it's own and someone else was controlling it.   It literally accelerated on it's own.  I couldn't stop it or steer it, everything was disabled.   My car jumped a curb and slammed into a pole.  Upon the first impact, none of the airbags deployed even though my entire chest slammed the steering wheel, it was only when I hit the pole did the airbags deploy.   I sustained injuries to my head, back, chest and hands.    Witnesses at the scene quickly pulled me out of the car, closed my door and took me away from the car because it was leaking oil and fluids everywhere and they were afraid it would explode.  The entire front end of my car was completely destroyed.   Nobody else was hurt other than me, but it could've been much worse if someone was walking or standing in front of my car.  The way it shot forward on it's own could've killed someone.  There was no way to control the car.   Police, fire and ambulance showed up to the scene.  Witnesses took pictures of the damage both inside and outside my car.  People at the scene said it was possibly the cars computer gone bad.  When I looked back at the photos, I can see that my car was in park.  Thankfully I had my seatbelt on so I survived it.",

I've been consistently losing air and recently brought them into my dealer for inspection, and they located a bulge in the sidewall in all four of my tires. (I have pictures of each of the buldges as marked by the dealer.)  They told me it was a manufacturer's defect and to contact Cooper Tires. Cooper Tires has a recall out for the same type of tire, only an earlier model, with the same exact defect: Recall No. 19T-024 on Cooper Evolution Tour DOT U9 40 1LT 3019. (Dated Dec. 2019.) When I contacted Cooper customer service, they said no recall for my model exists, and I'd have to get replacements under the warrantee, costing me an additional $350. If these tires have the same defect as the earlier model, they should be recalled immediately. I've been driving around on four bulging sidewalls and risking a crash as indicated by Recall No. 19T-024, all of which they recognized enough to recall their earlier model.  Attached is the print out from the dealer with the estimate to replace the tires with my road hazard warrantee through them, and pictures of where they marked the sidewall bulges on each tire.

When starting from a stop, as you would accelerate into a traffic lane the car without warning would suddenly act as if the key was turned off, ceasing to accelerate.  Exiting our neighborhood onto a thoroughfare with typical 35-50 mph traffic, my wife & I both had frequent instances of this failure to accelerate or dead throttle response.  With 50+ years of driving, 5 years of SCCA road racing, 5 years of teaching defensive driving, I'm still not sure what I've done to get the car to accelerate & avoid getting t-boned.  Several Honda dealerships have acted as if this is an unknown situation/condition.  Actually talked to 5 different Honda service writers who all denied that the problem existed.  Went to an independent Honda garage who had 5 boxes of the offending part-Throttle Position Sensor-on their office counter.  I was told it is a common problem, as evidenced by the number of TPS boxes they had.    This is an extreme hazard & danger to anyone driving a Honda that uses this particular piece of hardware.   I would urge a recall to force Honda to re-design this sensor to eliminate the potential non-acceleration issue.",

On Sep 19 2021, my husband was driving on Lancaster 14 north bound (uphill).  The CR-V go into \"limp\" mode and could not accelerate. Engine light turned on soon after.  He was able to cruise to the shoulder and restart the vehicle. Once it was restarted, the engine light turned off, the car could go again, and he drove and left it to the nearest dealer, they could not find any issue.

Plastics and dash covers steering wheel and are shaking vigorously inside the car and it only happens at low RPMs. 2015 honda crv TSB states that the problems were fixed for 2016 models (exact same problems that I am having: drive Mode 1 at idle speeds), but I am having this issue since day 1 of getting this car. It has been over 5 years and if the shakes continue to get worse, and I can not hear what is coming toward me, I will could be in dangerous situations that I just experienced, like not hearing the oncoming emergecy vehicles or someone honking at me to be safe. This only occurs for my vehicle when it is in drive and the car is not moving. As I give gas and RPM goes up, zero issues with vibration(s) occur.",

AT THAT TIME, I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER 36 YEARS BOTH ON MAUI AND AS AN AIR FORCE OFFICER IN THE CONUS.  IN ALL THAT TIME, I HAD NEVER DRIVEN RECKLESSLY OR EVEN SPED AS IS EVIDENCED BY MY DRIVING RECORD. THAT MORNING, MY VEHICLE HAD REPORTEDLY BEEN DRIVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND ENDED UP FLIPPING OVER SEVERAL TIMES LEADING TO MY HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY FOR SPINAL FUSION.  UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO THE RESULTING CONCUSSION, I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING FROM THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENT UNTIL WAKING UP IN THE ICU AFTER SURGERY, NOT EVEN DRIVING TO WORK. KNOWING THAT I WOULD NEVER PURPOSELY SPEED, I HIRED SOMEONE TO DOWNLOAD THE BLACK BOX DATA. TO MY SHOCK, IT SHOWED CONSTANT ACCELERATION, NO STEERING INPUTS, AND NO BRAKING INPUTS FOR AT LEAST FIVE SECONDS. THE ONLY REASON I'VE DECIDED TO PUT THIS OUT THERE NOW IS DUE TO THE PARALLELS I'VE READ ABOUT WITH TIGER WOODS' RECENT ACCIDENT.  I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE WHO HAS DRIVEN FOR DECADES WOULD EVER MISTAKE THE ACCELERATOR FOR THE BRAKE PEDAL.  MOREOVER, IF THEY DID, THEIR INSTINCT WOULD BE TO QUICKLY RELEASE THE ACCELERATOR THEN BRAKE, DEFINITELY NOT TO CONTINUE TO FLOOR IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  I'M NOT EXPECTING TO GET ANYTHING PERSONALLY OUT OF THIS COMPLAINT.  MY MAIN HOPE IS THAT INVESTIGATION WILL BE DONE TO PREVENT FURTHER INJURIES AND DEATHS. PLEASE INVESTIGATE TO SEE IF MANY OTHER BLACK BOX REPORTS FROM SIMILAR ACCIDENTS SHOW ACCELERATOR FLOORED WITH NO BRAKING OR STEERING INPUTS FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  PERHAPS THERE IS SOME COMBINATION OF INPUTS CAUSING WRONG SIGNALS TO BE SENT TO THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE.  I BELIEVE THE REASON THERE AREN'T MANY MORE REPORTS OF THIS IS DUE TO THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT IN MOST CASES, THE DRIVER ENDS UP EITHER DEAD OR HAVING A CONCUSSION.",

SO I HIT MY NEIGHBORS GARAGE DOOR AND SIDE OF HER HOME AND THE CAR STOP AFTER IT WENT OVER HER FOUNDATION OF HER HOME.  I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW THAT I WAS PRESSING AS HARD AS I COULD ON THE BRAKE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.  THIS ALL TOOK ABOUT 20 SECONDS, TO FAST.  I HAD THE BRAKES CHECK WHICH MECHANICALLY PASS ALL TEST 100%.  BUT ON THE ELECTORAL DID PASS.  2 CODE CAME UP. 1). U300616 - POWER SOURCE FAILURE FOR ECU (LOW VOLTAGE) FOR THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE AND THE SAME CODE FOR TIRE PRESSURE.  SO IT NOT THE MECHANIC OF THE CRV IT'S THE ECU BOX THE BOX WHICH EVERYTHING GOES THRU.  SO IT'S ELECTRICAL NOT MECHANICAL.  AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  THE 2016 CRV SHOULD BE RECALLED ON THE ECU BOX.  I NEVER WILL DRIVE THE CRV AGAIN.  YOU COULD REALLY KILL SOMEONE.  THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD LOOK DEEP INTO THIS AND HAVE A RECALL.  I DID CONTACT AMERICAN HONDA CORPORATION AND THEY DID RESEARCH IT, BUT I WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS MECHANICAL NOT ELECTRICAL.  AMERICAN HONDA WOULD HELP.

SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM AHMC REGARDING A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE ASAP ON MY VEHICLE. THE NOTICE MENTIONED THAT, \"THE SOFTWARE IN THE PCM CAUSES A LOW PRESSURE PROBLEM IN THE CVT. THIS MAY ALLOW THE BELT IN THE CVT TO SLIP. IF THE BELT SLIPS, YOU MAY SEE A SURGE IN RPM WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IF THE BELT SLIPS THE TRANSMISSION WILL BE DAMAGED AND DTC P1890 (THE CVT SPEED CONTROL SYSTEM) WILL SET.\" THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS COMPLETED ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND SINCE THEN, I HAVE EXPERIENCED A MORE PRONOUNCED VIBRATION UNDER MY DRIVER'S SEAT AND EVEN INTO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. THE INTENSITY OF THE VIBRATION VARIES, BUT IT HAS NOT GONE AWAY. NOW THAT I HAVE HIT THE 5K MILE MARK AND HAD MY FIRST SERVICE DONE, I AM AFRAID THAT THE OLDER THE TRANSMISSION GETS, THE WORSE THIS PROBLEM MIGHT BECOME. THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIBRATION ISSUE, BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED. BEFORE BUYING THIS VEHICLE, MY RESEARCH INDICATED THAT MANY CUSTOMERS WITH THE 2015 MODEL STARTED TO REPORT THE VIBRATION ISSUE RIGHT AROUND THIS TIME (5K MILES + OR AROUND THE FIRST SCHEDULED SERVICE) AND FOR MOST, THE PROBLEM BECAME WORSE. I AM CONVINCED THAT THESE ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THE NEW CVT TRANSMISSION. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO THE HONDA BRAND AND I REALLY LIKE THIS VEHICLE, BUT I AM STARTING TO REGRET MY PURCHASE!!! :-(  *TR",

NOTE I TALKED WITH MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR HONDA AND HE AGREED THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFECT / DESIGN PROBLEM THAT IS NOT ON OTHER SIMILAR SUV VEHICLES (I.E. THE SEAT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED SLOPING DOWNWARD TO RELIEVE BLOOD CIRCULATION PROBLEMS IN THE LEGS ABOVE THE KNEES).",
