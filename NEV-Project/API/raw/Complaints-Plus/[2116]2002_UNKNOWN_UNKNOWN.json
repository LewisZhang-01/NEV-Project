AFTER THE VERY NEXT TIME I USED THE TRAILER,ON 08/08/03 APPROXIMATELY 300 MILES LATER,THE LEFT REAR TIRE DEVELOPED A LARGE BUBBLE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE TREAD. I WAS ABLE TO CATCH IT BEFORE IT BLEW. I REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND AS BEFORE BUT WAS ABLE TO KEEP IT, AS BY THIS TIME I KNEW THE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE. ONLY 40 MILES LATER ON 08/14/03 I HAD THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOW. AFTER CHANGING THE TIRE ON SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR THE SECOND TIME I REPLACED BOTH FRONT TIRES WITH GOODYEARS, BECAUSE EACH TIME I WAS UNABLE TO FIND A DEALER THAT STOCKED THE CORRECT SIZE CARLILSE TIRE. BOTH TIRES THAT BLEW WHERE SEVERLY DAMAGED. THE ONE I HAVE WITH THE BUBBLE HAS ALSO GOT A BUBBLE ON THE INSIDE. I CHECK MY TIRES FOR CONDITION AND PSI BEFORE EACH TRIP AND AM NOWHERE NEAR THE WIEGHT LIMIT OF THE TRAILER OR THE TIRES.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2002 I RETURNED HOME FROM A FISHING TRIP AND ONCE AGAIN FOUND THE HARDENED BOLT BROKEN AGAIN. THE FACTORY WANTED TO JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER BOLT BUT I REFUSED AND RETURNED THE TRAILER TO MY DEALER FOR PROPER INSPECTION AND REPAIR. THE TRAILER WAS RETURNED TO THE FACTORY ON DECEMBER 5, 2002.  I TOLD MY DEALER AND THE FACTORY SEVERAL TIMES I WAS NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE TRAILER UNLESS A CAUSE TO THE TWO FAILURES WAS FOUND AND CORRECTIONS WERE MADE AND I WANTED DOCUMENTATION ON ALL FINDINGS AND REPAIRS. I MADE THE DEALER AND THE FACTORY AWARE THAT THE ANCHORING POINT FOR THE SAFETY CHAINS WAS FORWARD OF THE BOLT FOR THE SWING-AWAY TONGUE AND IF THE SWING-AWAY TONGUE WOULD HAVE BROKEN FREE FROM THE TRAILER THE SAFETY CHAINS WOULD HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT HOLD ONTO THE SWING-AWAY TONGUE THAT WOULD STILL BE ATTACHED TO THE TOW VEHICLE. THE BREAK AWAY CORD FOR MY HYDRAULIC BRAKES WOULD HAVE ALSO DONE NO GOOD SINCE THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER IS LOCATED IN THE SWING-AWAY TONGUE.

WHEN A VEHICLE WITH THE NEW TYPE HEADLIGHTS IS COMING OVER A RISE TOWARDS YOU , OR AROUND A SLIGHT CURVE  YOU CAN BE SET UP WITH THE LIGHTS DIRECTLY INTO YOUR EYES.  ON A DARK 2 LANE HIGHWAY AT NIGHT  IT IS LIKE A PHOTO FLASH IN YOUR EYES.  THESE LIGHTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO VEHICLES WITH AUTOMATIC AIMING TECHNOLGY SO A HEAVY TRUNK LOAD OR TRAILER WON'T AIM THEM HIGHER.  IN THE CITY THEY ARE ANNOYING BUT DON'T SEEM TO BLIND YOU AS MUCH BECAUSE OF THE STREET LIGHTING AND MOST OF THE ROADS ARE LEVEL.
