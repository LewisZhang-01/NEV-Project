They are able to reproduce but state no fix available.  It's how the car was made. In addition to vibration, engine makes a chirping noise when accelerating through vibration. I believe they are related although neither have been able to be fixed. No warning lights illuminate. I purchased this car for the 4wd as I live in snow/ice climate. However, excessive vibration/shudder makes driving in these conditions (any conditions) unsafe due to constant need to fluctuate acceleration/ deceleration to help minimize vibration/shudder to regain sense of control. If you maintain speed while vibrating on snow/ice you feel like you are losing control. This vibration HAS to have a long-term effect on engine/car integrity.  It's strong enough that some day I imagine I'll come to a stop and at that very moment, every screw will have come loose/undone from years of vibrating and I'll be left sitting in the seat holding just the steering wheel with the car in parts all around me.",

And YES, both 2004 and 2008 vehicles had recalls, transmission and engine problems. Fast forward to today, my Pilot wasn't being driven on a daily basis due to COVID-19 Pandemic from March 23, 2020 to present (Teleworking from home). However, while driving my vehicle heading home on June 11, 2021, the VSA Indicator, Malfunction Indicator Lamp and the VTM-4 System Indicator lights lit up on the instruction panel.  I took my vehicle to Pohanka Honda in Capitol Heights, Maryland on Saturday, June 12, 2021 but they told me that it would cost approximately $160.00 to run Diagnostic test for the lights and that they were booked for the day and to come back on Monday morning, June 14, 2021. Instead, on Monday afternoon, I took my vehicle to an independent mechanic who informed me that the oil is burning and spilling onto the engine and the engine light came on while they were test driving the car. The independent mechanic recommends that the engine and all six spark plugs be replaced. The independent mechanic also told me to researched the issues.  And upon further investigation on the NHTSA website, I found that the issues are linked to the NHTSA Campaign Number: 13V382000 (ENGINE). However, my VIN number is not under Recall. Even though there are approximately 258 total complaints for the 2013 Honda Pilots and of those, 59 were engine complaints, I am shocked that Honda has not addressed this issue as of June 2021.  That is just totally unacceptable and I am so over Hondas period. I will be contacting Honda of America for assistance with this repair. Thanks.",

SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS LATER THE DRIVERS' SIDE LOW BEAM STOPPED WORKING. WHEN LOOKING IT UP ONLINE, I FOUND MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS FAR BACK AS 2005 HONDA MODELS AND NOT ONLY WITH THE PILOTS BUT SEVERAL OTHER MODELS. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT ON 5/30/19 AT A HONDA DEALERSHIP TO REPAIR A RECALL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG AND WILL GET AN ESTIMATE ON THE COST FOR FIXING THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS. AT WHAT POINT DOES HONDA NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM INSTEAD OF THEIR CUSTOMERS PAYING FOR THEIR FAULTY WIRING?",

SECONDS LATER, MY WIFE GRABS HER FOOT AND SCREAMS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN. I PULL OVER AND SAW A .25 INCH? THICK BY 5 INCH LONG ABRASION THAT RAN ACROSS THE ARC OF HER RIGHT FOOT THAT TORE THE TOP LAYERS OF HER SKIN.

APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR AND NOTICED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT RESPONDING AT ALL - ENGINE WAS NOT REVVING, CAR WAS NOT MOVING FORWARD DESPITE FLOORING THE GAS PEDAL. STOPPED AND SHIFTED INTO REVERSE AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. SIMULTANEOUSLY, SEVERAL WARNING LIGHTS APPEARED INCLUDING VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL AMONG OTHERS. EVENTUALLY HAD TO LEAVE THE CAR DISABLED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND HAVE IT TOWED TO A LOCAL HONDA DEALER, WHERE THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. AFTER 3 DAYS, THEY \"RESET ALL THE COMPUTERS\" AND TOLD ME THE CAR WAS FIXED.     SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED 2.5 WKS LATER. AGAIN, DEALER COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THEY REPLACED THE \"BOX\" WHICH THE ACCELERATOR CONNECTS TO AND TOLD ME THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE FIXED.     3 DAYS AFTER RETURNING THE CAR TO ME, THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED A 3RD TIME. THIS TIME THE VEHICLE FLUIDS WERE ALSO OVERHEATING. I LEFT THE CAR RUNNING UNTIL A HONDA TECHNICIAN COULD COME AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE THE PROBLEM IN ACTION. UNFORTUNATELY, HE SHUT THE CAR OFF UPON ARRIVAL AND THEN WAS NOT ABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM. HONDA HAS NOW HAD MY VEHICLE FOR 8 DAYS WITH NO PROGRESS. THEIR ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO UNINSTALL THE REMOTE STARTER WHICH CAME WITH THE CAR WHEN I PURCHASED IT NEW. THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE REMOTE STARTER IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND HAVE NOT OFFERED TO COMPENSATE ME IN ANY WAY FOR ITS REMOVAL.     CAR IS ONLY 1.5 YRS OLD.   *TR   UPDATED 12/22/2015*JS",

THE FIRST MODE CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS A HOWLING (SIGNIFICANT AUDIBLE TONE CHANGE) FROM THE ENGINE RIGHT BEFORE THE VIBRATION BEGINS, WHICH IS THE SECOND MODE.  THE SECOND MODE IS THE VIBRATION/SHUDDER MOST PREDOMINATELY AROUND 44 MPH, BUT CAN OCCUR AT OTHER SPEEDS - DEPENDING ON THE \"LOAD\" ON THE ENGINE.  THE SHUDDER/VIBRATION CAN VARY FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY VIBRATION (LIKE GOING OVER SMALL NARROW RUMBLE STRIPS) TO A MORE PRONOUNCED SHUDDER, BOTH OF WHICH IS CAN BE FELT BY PASSENGERS AND/OR DRIVER. IN GENERAL, THE PILOT WILL VIBRATE/SHUDDER CONSISTENTLY, APPARENTLY WHEN THE VCM FEATURE IS IN TRANSITION.  HOWEVER, ON TWO OCCASIONS, A THIRD MODE OCCURRED: VERY SUDDENLY WHILE DRIVING ABOUT 45 MPH OR SO, BY SURPRISE, THE PILOT SHOOK (FRONT END AREA) TO SUCH A INTENSE DEGREE THAT IT IMPULSIVELY CAUSED THE DRIVER OF THE PILOT TO PULL-OVER AND STOP.

THE PROBLEM IS A NOTICEABLE VIBRATION WHEN THE ENGINE DROPS DOWN FROM HIGH ECO MODE (4 CYLINDERS) TO LOW ECO MODE (3 CYLINDERS - IF I UNDERSTAND THE ECO CYLINDER REDUCTION SYSTEM CORRECTLY).  IT IS SMOOTH IN HIGH ECO MODE BUT AS SOON AS IT DROPS DOWN, THE VEHICLE VIBRATES/RUMBLES SIGNIFICANTLY.  IT IS MY WIFE'S PRIMARY VEHICLE AND I DO NOT LIKE TO DRIVE IT FOR THAT REASON.  I DO NOT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUDIBLE VIBRATION ALTHOUGH WHEN IN LOW ECO MODE IT MAKES A SOUND AS WELL AS A VIBRATION WITH THE VIBRATION BEING THE MOST PRONOUNCED.  IT IS ODD THAT ONE PART OF THE ECO MODE IS SMOOTH AND THE OTHER PART IS ROUGH. I CAN PREDICT WHEN THE ROUGHNESS WILL OCCUR WHEN TRAVELING ON A RELATIVELY FLAT ROAD WITH GRADUAL INCLINES AND DECLINES.  WHEN THE ROAD DECLINES, THE LOW ECO MODE ENGAGES AND THE VIBRATION INITIATES AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE ROAD BEGINS TO INCLINE AT WHICH TIME THE ECO MODE TRANSFERS FROM ITS LOW MODE TO ITS HIGH MODE AND THE VIBRATION STOPS IMMEDIATELY.  THE VIBRATION IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH AND IS COMPARABLE TO RIDING ON SMOOTH ASPHALT AND THEN THE SURFACE CHANGING ABRUPTLY TO A ROUGH OIL AND CHIP ROAD SURFACE.  WE HAD A 2009 HONDA PILOT LX 4WD WITH THE SAME ECO SYSTEM AND THERE WAS NO VIBRATION IN LOW ECO MODE.  HAS ANYONE HAD A SUCCESSFUL FIX/REPAIR OF THIS ISSUE?  IT IS VERY ANNOYING TO ME AND THIS CANNOT BE NORMAL BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION.  IF NOTHING CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM, IS THERE A METHOD TO SHUT OFF THE LOW ECO SYSTEM FROM ACTIVATING BUT STILL HAVE THE HIGH ECO SYSTEM OPERABLE.  I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SMOOTH RIDE AND SACRIFICE SOME GAS MILEAGE THAN BE TORMENTED BY THIS VIBRATION.  THE VIBRATION IS SO OBVIOUS THAT IT CANNOT BE IGNORED ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE DRIVING IT.
