THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AND I EXPERIENCED A LACK OF BRAKING POWER WITH THE PEDAL HAVING TO BE COMPRESSED COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO SLOW THE RV.  THE ABS LIGHT REMAINED ON FOR THE DURATION OF MY SHORT TRIP.  THE BRAKES FELT \"MUSHY\" AT THAT TIME.  I TOOK THE RV TO A SERVICE CENTER WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SENSORS HAD \"FRIED\" AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  AT THE TIME OF THIS TRIP, THE RV HAD ONLY 3789 MILES ON IT.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ENGINEERING DEFECT ARE THAT WE WERE CHARGED $867.08 TO REPAIR THE REAR SENSOR SPEED SIGNAL AND THE ANTI LOCK BRAKE COMPUTER/SENSORS.  THIS TRIP OCCURRED AFTER SERVICE BULLETIN 50401-C RELATED TO SAFETY CONCERNS ON BOSCH BRAKE CALIPERS HAD BEEN COMPLETED BY BEAUDRY RV SERVICE CENTER IN SAN MARCOS, CA. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS ENGINEERING DESIGN DEFECT COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS INCLUDING FIRE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, INJURY OR DEATH TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE RV AND THAT OWNERS OF THE SUSPECT VEHICLES SHOULD RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AS WELL AS PAYMENT FOR FUTURE ENGINEERING UPGRADES TO PERMANENTLY RESOLVE THIS DEFECT AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THE MOTORHOME WILL BE RESTORED TO A SAFE AND MECHANICALLY SOUND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.  *TR",

THEY REFERRED ME TO ONE OF SEVERAL DEALERS IN THE AREA.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE TIRE, I WAS TOLD MICHELIN WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE FAILURE, AND THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON FAILURE FOR THIS TIRE.  THE FAILURE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EITHER UNDER INFLATION, OVER INFLATION OR OVERLOADING (TAKE YOUR CHOICE).  THESE ARE NOT VALID ASSERTIONS AS THE TIRE PRESSURE HAS BEEN MAINTAINED WITHIN 5 POUNDS OF MICHELIN'S RECOMMENDED PRESSURES, NOR HAVE THEY BEEN OVERLOADED.  I HAVE KEPT THE TIRE FOR INSPECTION BY ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED.  THIS TIRE IS ADVERTISED AS BEING DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR RV USEAGE.  AFTER NOTICING THE INORDINATE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BOTH ON THREADS ON THE INTERNET AND ON YOUR SITE, IT IS OBVIOUS THEY UTTERLY FAILED IN ACCOUMPLISHING A SAFE DESIGN.
