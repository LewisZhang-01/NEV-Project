ONLY THE DAYTIME RUNNING LAMP, SIDE MARKER LIGHT, AND MIRROR SIGNAL LIGHT WERE STILL FUNCTIONAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR.

THE FUSE BLOCK ITSELF ALSO SUFFERED SOME MELTING AT THIS TERMINAL. THE 30-AMP FUSE WAS NOT BLOWN SO I KNOW POWER DIDN'T EXCEED THE CAPACITY OF THE FUSE THAT IS THE CORRECT SIZE/RATING FOR THAT LOCATION. AFTER SOME RESEARCH I AM FINDING THAT THIS POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD AND CONFIRMED SAFETY HAZARD IS MORE COMMON THAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.
