I WAS DRIVING ON A STATE HIGHWAY IN PG COUNTY MD WHEN I HEARD A LOUD BANG AND MY CAR SUDDENLY SWERVED SHARPLY TO THE LEFT AND CROSSED THE CENTER LINE INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING DUMP TRUCK.  OBVIOUSLY I WAS ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY ENOUGH AND FORCE MY CAR BACK INTO THE CORRECT LANE AND THEN OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  IT TOOK EVERY BIT OF STRENGTH I HAD.  THE TRUCK WAS JUST ABOUT 30 FEET AWAY AND IF THE BREAK HAD BEEN A SECOND OR SO LATER THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO TIME TO REACT.  MY MECHANIC SAID IT WAS A BROKEN STRUT ASSEMBLY AND THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BREAK LIKE THAT.    IT WAS PRETTY TRAUMATIC TO THINK I COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD...    OCCASIONALLY I READ ABOUT AN ACCIDENT WHERE A VEHICLE CROSSES THE CENTER LINE INTO THE PATH OF ANOTHER VEHICLE.  WE ARE LEFT WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS WAS DUE TO DRIVER INATTENTION OR IMPAIRMENT.  WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE, DO YOU EVER FIND THAT THESE ACCIDENTS ARE DUE TO THE FAILURE OF A VEHICLE PART?

THE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE LINKAGES AND POWER STEERING PUMP(S) ARE LESS TROUBLING BUT MAY BE RELATED.  IT IS MY OPINION THE TIRE WEAR HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FAILURE OF THE STEERING COMPONENTS.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH 2 SETS OF GOODYEAR EAGLE GAS GUARANTEED AT 48,000 EACH (96,000 TOTAL) IN ONLY 68905 MILES.  THE FIRST RACK WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AT 32556 MILES.  THE SECOND RACK WAS REPLACED AT 64262 MILES.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER (65832 MILES) AND WHILE ON A TRIP TO ST. LOUIS THE CAR BECAME UNCONTROLLABLE AND I HAD ROYAL OAKS CHRYSLER-JEEP IN ST. PETERS, MO (636) 928-8000 REPLACE THE INNER TIE-ROD BUSHINGS.  UPON MY RETURN TO DAYTON, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD IMPROVED BUT WAS NOT CORRECTED.  AT 66396 MILES TOM HARRIGAN CHRYSLER REPLACED 2 MORE BUSHINGS (PART # 4755001), FRONT STRUTS, AND THE LINK-SWAY ELIMINATOR.  THE CAR IS NOW SAFE BUT THERE ARE SQUEAKS AND HYDROLIC GROWLING COMING FROM THE STEERING MECHANISM THAT THE MECHANICS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE.  THE MECHANIC AT TOM HARRIGAN CHRYSLER INDICATED THAT STEERING PROBLEMS LIKE MINE ARE COMMON ON THE EAGLE, AND OTHER LHS CARS OF THIS VINTAGE.  COMMON OR NOT, I SEE MULTIPLE FAILURES OF A MAJOR STEERING COMPONENT AS A SERIOUS SAFETY THREAT TO ME AND MY FAMILY.  A MEAN-TIME-BETWEEN-FAILURES OF 34,000 MILES IS EVIDENCE TO ME THAT THE STEERING RACK DOES NOT POSESS THE REASONABLE DURABILITY EXPECTED/DEMANDED OF SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT.  IT IS ALSO INDICITIVE OF A MATERIAL/MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  THE FACT THAT SO MANY STEERING COMPONENTS FAILED IN MY EAGLE VISION AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE FAILURES ARE RELATED, AT LEAST IN PART, AND I AM THANKFUL THAT MY WIFE WAS NOT AT THE WHEEL WHEN THE MOST SERVE SHAKING (AND NEAR LOSS OF CONTROL) OCCURRED.",

SECOND, JULY 2000 THE WIPERS STOPPED WORKING WHILE DRIVING IN A STORM.  I CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE OF MAJOR CONCERN BECAUSE THE WIPER ARM ASSEMBLY CONTAINS A SMALL PLASTIC PART WHICH WORE OUT.  THIS PLASTIC PART IS HIDDEN UNDER THE EXTERIOR WINDSHIELD TRIM OF THE CAR.  THERE IS NO WAY TO VISUALLY INSPECT THE PART WITHOUT REMOVING THE TRIM AND BECAUSE THE PART STOPS WORKING DURING USE IN BAD WEATHER WITH NO WARNING TO THE DRIVER...THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SERIOUS DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN.  WHEN THE WIPERS STOP WORKING DURING A STORM IT IS MOST LIKELY A DRIVER COULD HAVE A HEAD-ON COLLISION IN WHICH THE WINDSHIELD AREA WOULD BE SMASHED.  THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE WIPER ASSEMBLY BEING DESTROYED AND NOT BEING IDENTIFIED AS THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH.  I THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN, ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE AGE OF AUTOMOBILES AND THE POSSIBLE WEARING OUT OF THIS PART.  ALSO, A CONCERN EXISITS BECAUSE OTHER CAR MODELS MAY HAVE THIS SAME DESIGN IN THEIR MANUFACTURED PARTS AND DUE TO DAMAGE IN HEAD-ON COLLISIONS IT IS NOT SHOWING UP AS THE CAUSE.  *AK",
