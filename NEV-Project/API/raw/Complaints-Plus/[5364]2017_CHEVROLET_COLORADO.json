I WILL HAVE IT REPLACED FOR THE 5TH TIME NEXT WEEK BUT ACCORDING TO ONLINE COLORADO DIESEL FORUMS THIS IS AN ENDLESSLY FAILING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.  AS A CONSEQUENCE MANY OWNERS ARE WORKING WITH AFTER-MARKET TUNERS TO REMOVE THIS EMISSIONS CONTROL. THE MESSAGING I SEE ONLINE IS THAT THIS WILL BE AN ENDLESS EXPENSE IF I KEEP MY TRUCK BEYOND THE LIMITED EMISSIONS WARRANTY. TO-DATE THE WARRANTY HAS COVERED THE REPAIRS(~ $500 EACH) BUT THE EMISSIONS WARRANTY WILL BE EXPIRING SOON.  I THINK THE NHTSA AND EPA SHOULD FORCE CHEVROLET/GM TO PROVIDE AN UNLIMITED EMISSIONS WARRANTY.

WHEN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVISOR TURNED THE TRUCK INTO THE SERVICE BAY, A LOUD METAL-TO-METAL SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK.  ON 4 DECEMBER 2019, I MET WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVISOR AND THE AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN AT THE COURTESY GMC DEALERSHIP TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF THE TRUCK.  THE AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO CONTACT GMC ABOUT THE ISSUE THE NEXT MORNING.  ON 5 DECEMBER 2019, I WAS CONTACTED BY THE AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN WHO INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH AN ENGINEER AT GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION.  THE ENGINEER ADVISED THE AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN TO REPLACE THE PART THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REPLACED, BUT ORDER THE PART THROUGH A DIFFERENT PARTS WAREHOUSE.  THIS WAS STRANGE TO ME AS I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THE PARTS FROM ANY WAREHOUSE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.  ON DECEMBER 2019, THE TRUCK REPAIR WAS COMPLETED AND WAS RETURNED TO ME.

SO YOU CAN ACCIDENTALLY TURN ON 4 WHEEL DRIVE, AND NOT KNOW UNTIL YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. THIS IS NOT IDEAL. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD TO FIND THE KNOB TO TURN IT BACK TO 2 WHEEL DRIVE. THIS COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.

IT SEEMS THAT GM DECIDED THAT JUST A TINY LED LIGHT WHICH IS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN SEE IN DAYTIME WAS ENOUGH. THE ONLY THING THAT COMES UP ON THE DASH IS A MESSAGE THAT READS \"SHIFT IN PROGRESS\" BUT NO OTHER INDICATOR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TRANSFER CASE HAS IN FACT MADE THE SHIFT OR WHAT DRIVE MODE IT SHIFTED INTO.THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THE LOCATION OF THIS 4WD SHIFT KNOB. IT'S LOCATED TO THE LEFT, BELOW AND BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL NEXT TO THE HEADLIGHT CONTROL KNOB AS MY ATTACHED PHOTOS WILL SHOW. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHILE DRIVING SINCE IT'S VIEW IS BLOCKED BY THE STEERING WHEEL AND IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY SEE WHAT DRIVE MODE THE VEHICLE IS IN YOU MUST TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING, TRY TO EITHER LOOK THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE STEERING WHEEL, AROUND IT OR BELOW IT TO SEE THE POSITION OF THIS KNOB. I MYSELF WAS DRIVING ON THE BEACH IN 4WD WHEN I WENT FISHING. WHEN I LEFT THE BEACH MY TRUCK WASN'T DRIVING NORMALLY AND I REALIZED I NEVER SHIFTED BACK INTO 2WD. I LITERALLY HAD TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO LOOK AT THIS KNOB TO CHECK TO SEE WHAT POSITION IT WAS IN AND I CAME VERY CLOSE TO HAVING AN ACCIDENT. ALSO DRIVING ON PAVEMENT IN 4WD CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE DRIVELINE AND ALSO EFFECTING THE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM AND ABS. THIS IS THE FIRST 4 WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE I'VE OWNED THAT LACKED A 4WD INDICATOR REMINDER LIGHT. GM ACTUALLY HAS AN OFF-ROAD 4WD INFORMATION SCREEN IN THE DIC ON SOME MODELS BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY DIDN'T MAKE THIS SCREEN AVAILABLE ON THE COLORADO. THIS FEATURE SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ANY OF THEIR 4WD VEHICLES OR AT THE VERY LEAST A 4WD REMINDER INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE DASH DUE TO THE UNSAFE LOCATION OF THE 4WD CONTROL KNOB. THIS IS JUST AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN!",
