AFTER NOTICING THE INSTABILITY AND SWAYING ACTION, I CONDUCTED CURSORY INSPECTIONS OF THE FRONT END AND SUSPENSION AREAS OF THE VEHICLE. AS A RESULT OF INSPECTIONS, I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE UNDERCARRIAGE. WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON 20 SEPTEMBER 2014, WITHOUT WARNING, THE RIGHT FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM BROKE. IT COULD BE OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS A FAILURE IN THE WELD BETWEEN THE HANGER BRACKET AND THE MAIN PORTION OF THE CONTROL ARM. AFTER THE CONTROL ARM BROKE, IT CAUSED THE CONTROL ARM TO MOVE TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE; IT CAUSED THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE TO SLAM ABRUPTLY INTO THE REAR PORTION OF THE TIRE WELL; IT THEN CAUSED THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE TO LOCK UP, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED THE TIRE TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO SKID. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WHICH MINIMIZED RESULTS: VEHICLE WAS ONLY TRAVELING AT ABOUT 45 MPH; IT OCCURRED ON SECONDARY ROAD; ROAD WAS STRAIGHT AND LEVEL; THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC; AND ROAD SURFACE WAS DRY. THERE WAS ADDITIONAL VEHICLE DAMAGE. UPON CHECKING THE RECALLS FOR THE 2002 SUBARU FORESTER, I DISCOVERED THAT THE 2003-2008 FORESTERS WERE RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT REASON (RECALL ID # 70673.) THERE WERE OTHER ADDITIONAL RECALLS AS WELL FOR SIMILAR ISSUE. AFTER CONTACTING SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE, I WAS ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM UNDER THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RECALL WERE THE SAME.

I CONSIDER DRIVING A VEHICLE WITH OUT OF BALANCE WHEELS AND IMPORTANT IF NOT DANGEROUS SITUATION.  ALSO, TO CLEAN THE WHEELS ENTAILS GETTING DOWN ON HANDS AND KNEES WITH A SCREWDRIVER AND SCRAPING THE DEPOSITS FROM THE OUTSIDE GROOVE, BEHIND THE WHEEL \"SPOKES\" AND AROUND THE INSIDE GROOVE.  THE ONLY ACCESS TO THIS IS THRU THE SMALL OPENINGS IN THE \"SPOKES\".  IT ALWAYS TAKES AT LEAST THREE SUCH CLEANING OF ALL EFFECTED WHEELS BEFORE ONE CAN GET ALL THE DEPOSITS REMOVED AND THE WHEELS BACK IN BALANCE.  WHEN YOU ARE ON THE WAY TO CHURCH DURING THE MIDDLE OF WINTER THIS SITUATION BECOMES UNTOLERABLE AND RESULTS IN HAVING TO DRIVE WITH UNBALANCED WHEELS TO DESTINATION OR AT LEAST A LOCATION WHERE REMOVAL OF DEPOSITS CAN BE DONE SAFELY.  EXPLAINING THIS PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT AND I DO NOT KNOW THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF WHEEL PARTS/CONSTRUCTION.  IN ALL VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED THE OUTSIDE OF THE WHEEL IS SOLID, NO OPENINGS, OTHER THAN FOR LUG BOLTS THEREFORE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR DEPOSITS TO STICK AND OF COURSE HUBCAPS FURTHER PROTECT FOR THIS.  ON THE SUBARU THE WHEEL IS NOT SOLID BUT OF AN OPEN SPOKED DESIGN ALLOWING SAND, MUD, SNOW TO EASILY SETTLE INSIDE THE WHEEL.  THERE ARE NO HUBCAPS AVAILABLE TO AT LEAST PROTECT THE OUTSIDE OF THE WHEEL.  EVEN IF THERE WAS THAT WOULDN'T STOP STUFF FROM GETTING IN FROM THE INSIDE.
