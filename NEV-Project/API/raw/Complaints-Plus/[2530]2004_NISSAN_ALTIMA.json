SINCE NOTICING THE RUST I HAVE LOOKED AT DOZENS OF SIMILAR NISSAN ALTIMAS IN STORE PARKING LOTS ALL WITH THE SAME PREMATURE RUST PATTERN. IT APPEARS THAT NISSAN DESIGNED THE FLOOR PANS WITH A DRAIN PLUG WHICH ALLOWS WATER PENETRATION ABOVE THE FLOOR PAN WHERE IT CAUSES RUST. THE REST OF THE FLOOR PAN ON THE ENTIRE VEHICLE IS IN EXCEPTIONALLY PRISTINE SHAPE, BUT DUE TO THE IMPROPERLY DESIGNED/INSTALLED FLOOR PLUGS THE RUST HAS CAUSED HOLES TO DEVELOP IN THE FLOOR PAN AROUND THE FRONT PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. UPON NOTICING THE RUST, I TALKED WITH A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO STATED HE HASN'T SEEN A NISSAN ALTIMA OF SIMILAR AGE IN HIS SHOP THAT DID NOT HAVE IDENTICAL RUST PATTERNS IN THE SAME SPOT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND THE RUST IN THIS ONE AREA AROUND THE DRAIN PLUGS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LACK OF RUST EVERYWHERE ELSE. HOLES IN FLOORBOARDS OF LATE MODEL CARS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE MOST CONSUMERS WOULD NEVER SUSPECT THIS WOULD BE AN ISSUE ON LATE MODEL CARS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF RUST. HOLES IN THE FLOORBOARDS CAN ALLOW PENETRATION OF DEADLY EXHAUST FUMES, ESPECIALLY IN STOP AND GO TYPE DRIVING AS WELL AS PERSONAL SAFETY RISK AS THIS WEAKENS THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE UNIBODY DESIGN IN A CRASH. ALSO IF UNDETECTED LONG ENOUGH IT CAN CAUSE SEATS TO LOOSEN AND FALL FROM THEIR MOUNTS. I STRONGLY URGE THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD TO ISSUE AN IMMEDIATE RECALL SINCE IT APPEARS THE MANUFACTURER IS UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RISK IT IS PUTTING ON CONSUMERS.  *TR",

THE GUY BEHIND ME WAS VERY CLOSE TO HITTING MY CAR BUT LUCKILY HE HAD TO SLAM HIS BRAKES VERY HARD.

A POLICE OFFICER AND OTHER MEN PUSHED MY CAR TO THE EMERGENCY LANE. ANOTHER INCIDENT, 9/21 AS I PICKED UP MY CAR FROM A MECHANIC THAT REPLACED MY RADIATOR, ON ROUTE 17 MY CAR WAS DRIVING AT A VERY SLOW SPEED AND STALLED. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED IT BACK ON AND ENTERED A LANDMARK PARKING LOT. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT ON NHTSA.GOV THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE CRANK ANGLE SENSOR PARTS: ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME MY CAR ENGINE WAS UNABLE TO COOL SO A TOW TRUCK TOOK MY CAR TO MEADOWLANDS NISSAN DEALER IN NJ AND THEY REFUSED TO PERFORM THE \"ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING\" RECALL CLAIMING THAT THEIR ECM RECALL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TEMPERATURE AND DRIVE-ABILITY. I MENTIONED THAT ON THE GOVERNMENT SITE IT CLEARLY STATES \"ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING\" BUT THEY STATED THAT NISSAN DEALERS ARE PRIVATE DEALERS AND DO NOT CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS. THE MAN TOLD ME THEY FOLLOW WHATEVER THEY HAVE IN THEIR NISSAN SYSTEM, NOT THE GOVERNMENT. I AM SO OFFENDED THAT MY LIFE WAS ON THE LINE TWICE OVER NISSAN'S HAZARDOUS RECALLS. YET, THEY ARE REFUSING TO MAKE MY CAR A SAFE VEHICLE. I DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE I'M ONLY 21 I\"M WAY TOO YOUNG TO DIE OVER A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE ENGINE.

THE ENTIRE REST OF THE CAR UNDERCARRIAGE HAS PRACTICALLY ZERO RUST.

SINCE I DO NOT PERFORM THE CAR MAINTENANCE I WOULD HAVE NO OTHER WAY OF NOTICING, UNLESS I SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED SOME KIND OF RUST INSPECTION -- OR ASKED TO GO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE EVERY TIME IT WAS IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE OR OTHER MAINTENANCE.

THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD US THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR DRIVING OR CARE, THIS ISSUE WILL OCCUR EVERY YEAR OR SO AND WE WILL HAVE TO GET IT REPAIRED OR CAR WILL STALL. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT WE CAN PAY THEM TO TAKE OUR CAR TOTALLY APART AND THEN THEY CAN TRY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM - BUT I CANNOT SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY TO THE DEALERSHIP TO SPEND HOURS LOOKING INTO MY CAR SO THEY CAN MAYBE FIX THE ISSUE. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET NISSAN TO HELP - BUT NOBODY RETURNS MY CALLS. I ALSO TRIED THE DEALERSHIP - BUT THERE TOO - NO ONE ANSWERS OR RETURNS MY CALLS. I WANT NISSAN TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS ISSUE AND FIX IT. I HAVE 2 CHILDREN AND I CANNOT DO WITHOUT A CAR AND CERTAINLY CANNOT PAY SO MUCH TO KEEP GETTING IT REPAIRED FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  WE HAVE HAD THIS  CAR REPAIRED FOR THE SAME STUFF 4 TIMES. IT HAS STALLED AND WE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH IT. OUR SCHEDULES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED. I HAVE BEEN LATE TO PICK UP MY CHILDREN, WE HAD TO CANCEL THEIR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL OR IN THE SHOP. WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY TO GET IT TOWED EVERYTIME IT STOPPED. I THINK IT IS ABOUT TIME NISSAN TOOK CARE OF ITS PRODUCT.   I CAN UNDERSTAND WEAR AND TEAR - BUT THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING. NISSAN HAS TO HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",

IT APPEARS THAT NISSAN DESIGNED THE FLOOR PANS WITH A DRAIN PLUG WHICH ALLOWS WATER PENETRATION ABOVE THE FLOOR PAN WHERE IT CAUSES RUST. THE REST OF THE FLOOR PAN ON THE ENTIRE VEHICLE IS IN EXCEPTIONALLY PRISTINE SHAPE, BUT DUE TO THE IMPROPERLY DESIGNED/INSTALLED FLOOR PLUGS THE RUST HAS CAUSED HOLES TO DEVELOP IN THE FLOOR PAN AROUND THE FRONT PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND THE RUST IN THIS ONE AREA AROUND THE DRAIN PLUGS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LACK OF RUST EVERYWHERE ELSE. HOLES IN FLOORBOARDS OF LATE MODEL CARS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE MOST CONSUMERS WOULD NEVER SUSPECT THIS WOULD BE AN ISSUE ON LATE MODEL CARS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF RUST. HOLES IN THE FLOORBOARDS CAN ALLOW PENETRATION OF DEADLY EXHAUST FUMES, ESPECIALLY IN STOP AND GO TYPE DRIVING AS WELL AS PERSONAL SAFETY RISK AS THIS WEAKENS THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE UNIBODY DESIGN IN A CRASH.  ALSO IF UNDETECTED LONG ENOUGH IT CAN CAUSE SEATS TO LOOSEN AND FALL FROM THEIR MOUNTS.

NOTICED WHEN PULLING OUT OF DRIVEWAY AFTER CAR HAD SIT OVERNIGHT IN GARAGE THAT STEERING WHEEL WAS BINDING WHEN I TRIED TO TURN THE VEHICLE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE DRIVE THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BIND BOTH DURING TURNING AND WHEN RETURNING TO STRAIGHT.  THE BINDING CAUSED EXTRA EFFORT (REQUIRING BOTH HANDS) TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND ALSO REQUIRED EXTRA EFFORT TO RETURN THE WHEELS TO STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE BINDING PREVENTED THE WHEELS FROM RETURNING TO STRAIGHT ON THEIR OWN.  THE BINDING WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO TURN THE WHEEL AND THE DIFFICULTY IN STRAIGHTENING THE WHEELS TO STOP TURNING.  THE BINDING FORCE WAS INTERMITTENT AND SEEMED TO BE RELATED TO CERTAIN PLACES IN THE ORIENTATION OF THE WHEEL.

CLEARLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS PART.  WHEN I FINALLY GOT THE NEW PART (48080-8J000 LOWER STEERING U-JOINT) AND INSTALLED IT THE STEERING WORKED SMOOTHLY AGAIN. *TR",

I CONTACTED NISSAN NORTH AMERICA AND FILED A COMPLAINT AND AFTER SOME BACK AND FORTH THEY AGREED TO COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR (APPROX. $500).   ON MARCH 3RD, 2010 AT 70,885 THE CAR WOULD NOT START SO I HAD IT TOWED TO A CERTIFIED REPAIR SHOP WHO DIAGNOSED IT WITH A BAD CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR AGAIN. THE REPAIR COST ME $265.  CLEARLY THERE IS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM WITH THESE SENSORS AND REPROGRAMMING THE ECM IS NOT A PROPER FIX. APPARENTLY EVEN REPLACING THE SENSOR ONCE (BY A NISSAN DEALER) DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.

THEY REFUSED TO DO SO, SAYING THAT IF I HAD OTHER PROBLEMS THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT WHEN IT HAPPENED. TODAY JANUARY 26, 2009 I WENT IN TO THE BIG O TIRE STORE TO HAVE MY TIRES ROTATED. AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED AS I WAS ON MY WAY HOME MY CAR WAS PULLING TO THE LEFT. SO I WENT BACK TO THE STORE. AFTER SOME TRIAL AND ERROR THEY HAVE FOUND THAT A SECOND TIRE THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN ON THE RIGHT FRONT HAS A BELT SEPARATION PROBLEM AND ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT. SINCE TWO OF THE ORIGINAL TIRES HAVE FAILED IN THE SAME WAY I HAVE ASKED THAT THEY REPLACE THE OTHER TWO ORIGINAL TIRES BEFORE I HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE MORE SEVERE. SO FAR THE ANSWER HAS BEEN NO FROM THE LOCAL STORE AND FROM THEIR NATIONAL CONSUMER CONTACT. MY VIEW IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT FOR OTHERS. *TR",

MY HUSBAND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM BUT HE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING. MY HUSBAND ASK IF HE WOULD GO ON A TEST DRIVE WITH HIM. MY HUSBAND ASKED HIM TO DRIVE. WHEN THEY CAME BACK, MY HUSBAND SAID NOT ONLY WAS IT DOING THE SAME THING BUT IT CUT OFF ON THEM AS WELL.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE WOULD WRITE A NOTE ABOUT WHAT IT WAS STILL DOING.  WE HAD JUST BEGRUDGINGLY FORKED OUT NEARLY $1400 AND THE CAR WAS DOING THE SAME EXACT THING. WE WERE UPSET AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT DID THEY FIX? HE ASSURED US THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT. HE ASKED US WHAT WE WANTED HIM TO DO. MY HUSBAND SAID THAT WE JUST NEEDED A RENTAL. HE AGREED AND SET US UP WITH ONE.  FINALLY WE WERE ABLE TO PICK THE CAR UP AND WHILE IT STILL RAN A BIT ROUGH IT DIDN'T JERK AND IT DIDN'T CUT OFF. WE ASK WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT AND THEY SAID IT WAS SOMETHING WITH THE ENGINE 9500 INT AND  ENTERPRISE INV D907447 PO 151165. SO WE ASKED WHY WE WERE CHARGED FOR ALL THAT OTHER STUFF. HE SAID CAUSE IT STILL NEEDED IT. AND AT THIS TIME WE ALSO HAD ASKED ABOUT RECALLS. THEY SAID THERE WERE NONE.  IRONICALLY IN GOING THROUGH OUR OLD A FEW MONTHS LATER MAIL WE FOUND A SAFETY RECALL NOTICE THAT TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MY CAR DID. WE NOTIFIED OUR LAWYER AND ASK IF WE SHOULD PROCEED AND HE TOLD US TO FIRST REPORT IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  ALTHOUGH I REALLY LIKE MY ALTIMA I HAVE HAD TO MANY PROBLEMS.

THIS COULD RESULT IN A CRASH WITHOUT WARNING. *AK    THE NOTICE FURTHER ADVISED THAT MY NISSAN DEALER WOULD REPROGRAM THE ECM, FREE OF CHARGE.  THIS SERVICE SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 1 HOUR TO COMPLETE.  I MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MY DEALER TO HAVE THIS SERVICE PERFORMED ON MY ALTIMA.  WHILE IN FOR THIS SERVICE, I WAS CALLED BY THE DEALER AND NOTIFIED THAT SEVERAL UNRELATED SERVICE ITEMS WERE FOUND.  THEY DID NOT FORCE THEM ON ME BUT DID THEY DID TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 'SELL' THEM....BETTER GAS MILEAGE (CLEAN THROTTLES) AND BRAKE PERFORMANCE (REPLACE BRAKE FLUID).    WELL, THE FREE SERVICE TO 'REPROGRAM' THE ECM, TURNED INTO A SERVICE BILL IN THE $450.00 RANGE.  THE LIST COST TO REPROGRAM THE ECM WAS $58.00.  SO, I AVOIDED A $58 CHARGE BUT WAS 'SOLD' ADDITIONAL SERVICES SO NISSAN ACTUALLY GENERATED CLOSE TO $400 IN REVENUE ON A 'FREE' RECALL.     THE NHTSA RECALL NUMBER IS 06V-242.    IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF 100,000 OTHER CONCERNED ALTIMA OWNERS RESPONDED TO THE RECALL, WERE 'SOLD' SIMILAR 'NEEDED' SERVICE, NISSAN WOULD COLLECT $40,000,000 IN SERVICE FEES.....A MINOR REPROGRAMMING RECALL COULD TURN INTO A LARGE PROFIT GENERATING MACHINE.

TURNS OUT IT WAS THE STARTER THAT WENT AND THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED ON A VEHICLE THAT WAS ONLY A YEAR OLD. SO BECAUSE OF THIS I HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED FROM MY DRIVEWAY TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEN THE LATCH BROKE OFF ON THE CENTER CONSOLE INSIDE THE VEHICLE.  I AM NOT ROUGH USING IT AT ALL.  ITS NORMAL USE FOR THIS LATCH YET IT BROKE OFF AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR A YEAR.

I AM 7 MONTHS PREGNANT AND WAS VERY SCARED WHEN I FOUND THIS PROBLEM.  WHAT IF THERE IS EVER A CAR FIRE OR AN ACCIDENT AND I CANNOT GET OUT?  YOU CAN OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT NOT THE INSIDE.  HYANNIS NISSAN CLAIMS ITS A DOOR LATCH PROBLEM AND IT HAD TO BE REPLACED.
