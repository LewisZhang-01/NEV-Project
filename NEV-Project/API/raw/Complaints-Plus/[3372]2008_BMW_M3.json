IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT BMWNA IS WELL AWARE OF, BUT INSISTS THAT IT IS \"NORMAL BEHAVIOR\" FOR MY CAR/TRANSMISSION. I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE DEALER, AND THEY WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE IT, BUT THEY WERE TOLD BY BMW THAT THIS WAS \"NORMAL BEHAVIOR.\"    THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN- LIKE FOR A TURN, BUT DO NOT COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE DCT TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT WHAT GEAR TO SELECT BECAUSE WHEN YOU STEP ON THE GAS TO ACCELERATE, THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE ONSET OF POWER- UP TO 2-3 SECONDS. BY THIS TIME, THE DRIVER IS USUALLY REALLY DIGGING INTO THE THROTTLE. THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY PICKS A GEAR, WHICH RESULTS IN THE CAR SUDDENLY LURCHING FORWARD, SOMETIMES INVOKING THE ANTI-SKIP CONTROL.     THE DANGER IN THIS BEHAVIOR OCCURS WHEN MAKING A TURN INTO ON-COMING TRAFFIC AFTER SLOWING DOWN TO AROUND 10-15 MPH. AFTER THE TURN, THE CAR IS POSITIONED IN THE TRAFFIC LANE, BUT YOU HAVE NO POWER TO ACCELERATE INTO THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. THE ONCOMING CARS ARE NOW CLOSING IN ON YOUR CAR AT A FAST RATE, AND YOU'RE BASICALLY STUCK. THIS SITUATION IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE \"AUTO\" MODE OF THE DCT TRANSMISSION, BUT ALSO OCCURS TO A LESSER DEGREE WHILE IN THE MANUAL MODE WHEN YOU SELECT SECOND GEAR IN PREPARATION FOR THE TURN. IT IS ALSO VERY REPEATABLE IN BOTH MODES.    THESE PROBLEMS STARTED OCCURRING AFTER A PREVIOUS RECALL ON THIS TRANSMISSION WHERE THE ENGINE WOULD STALL UNDER HARD BRAKING OR NOT SHIFT UNDER HARD BRAKING. THE RECALL FIXED THAT PROBLEM, BUT INTRODUCED THIS PROBLEM, WHICH OCCURS ALMOST EVERY DAY WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS PROBLEM ONLY OCCURRED DURING A SPECIFIC SITUATION.

WHILE DRIVING INTO THE SHOPPING CENTER ENTRANCE (10 OR 15 MILES PER HOUR) I FELT A JOLT AND THE CAR SLOWED DRAMATICALLY.  I CHECKED THE REARVIEW MIRROR TO SEE IF I HAD BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER CAR, BUT HAD NOT.  I THEN REALIZED THAT THE ENGINE WAS NOT RUNNING, PUT IN THE CLUTCH AND COASTED TO A STOP AT A STOP SIGN.  I ATTEMPTED TO RE-START THE CAR BUT WAS UNABLE TO.  THE ENGINE 'TURNED OVER' BUT WOULD NOT START. THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS OR MESSAGES BEFORE OR AFTER THE FAILURE OR AT ANY OTHER TIME.  AT THIS POINT, I USED BMW ASSIST TO GET HELP SINCE I WAS PARTIALLY BLOCKING A BUSY INTERSECTION WITHIN THE SHOPPING CENTER.   A TOW TRUCK  ARRIVED ABOUT 45 MINUTES AFTER MY CALL TO BMW ASSIST.   WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED, THE DRIVER POINTED OUT A LEAK AND PUDDLE/STAIN ON THE ASPHALT COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  THE STAIN WAS ABOUT 2 BY 3 FEET.  THERE WAS ALSO A SMELL OF GASOLINE.   WHEN THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE ADVISOR ALSO NOTICED GAS STILL LEAKING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND DRIPPING ON THE GROUND.  A LOANER CAR AND I WAS ON MY WAY.      ON MONDAY, JULY 28TH I CALLED THE SA TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE CAR AT ABOUT 3:00 PM.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AND A CONNECTING HOSE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  HE SAID THE PARTS WERE ORDERED AND SHOULD BE ON HAND BY WEDNESDAY, JULY 30 TO BE INSTALLED.  I ASKED ABOUT THE HOSE, AND THE RESULTING GASOLINE LEAK AND HE COMMENTED ABOUT THE LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS THAT HAD BEEN SPRAYED OUT IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE HOSE. THERE EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHIC FIRE DUE TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GASOLINE LEAK.  THE DEALERSHIP WILL REPAIR THE PUMP AND HOSE UNDER WARRANTY. THE CAR IS A BMW 335I. *TR",
