AFTER TIME THE MUDFLAPS WEAR ON THE AIR TANKS UNTIL THEY LEAK AND OR BLOWOUT CAUSING IMMEDIATE AIR LOSS WHICH LOCKS UP ALL BRAKES WITH PARKING BRAKE CAPABILITY. THIS ENDS UP IN LOSS OF CONTROL OFF VEHICLE. AS THESE TRUCKS GET OLDER MORE OF THEM WILL FAIL. THIS IS A COMMON DESIGN FOR KENWORTH T800 TRUCKS AND SOMEONE SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS BEFORE IT CAUSES A FATALITY.   *TR",
