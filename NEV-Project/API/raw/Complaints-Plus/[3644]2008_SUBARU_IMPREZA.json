AFTER NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH SUBARU SERVICE, THEY FINALLY SEEMED TO AGREE TO WORK WITH ME AND INVESTIGATE WHY THIS HAPPENED. AT FIRST, THEY SEEMED TO WANT TO DISREGARD THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN AND THEY REALLY MADE IT SOUND LIKE I WAS TO BLAME (IE, BAD DRIVING). I EXPLAINED TO THEM OVER AND OVER THAT MY OTHER CAR IS A 15 YEAR OLD MANUAL JETTA WITH THE ORIGINAL CLUTCH, SO THE PROBLEM IS NOT BAD DRIVING. AFTER MUCH BACK AND FORTH, SUBARU PAID FOR THE ENTIRE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLUTCH AND THROWOUT BEARING, AS WELL AS SOME HYDRAULIC HOSES AND EVEN THE TOW TO THE DEALER.

AS I WAS DRIVING CAUTIOUSLY, NO ONE WAS INJURED AND NO OTHER VEHICLE, EXCEPT MINE, SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THE FRONT HEADLIGHT.    THE CAR WAS LESS THAN A MONTH OLD HAD FEWER THAT 650 MILES ON ODOMETER. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTED THE CAR ON DEC. 17, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT BRAKE VACUUM BOOSTER HOSE VALVE WAS DEFECTIVE.    THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER IN REFUSING TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY WROTE TO ME STATING THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT THAT ONLY OCCURS IN EXTREME COLD WEATHER, AND SUBARU PERFORMS MOST OF THE INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY ON NEW CARS. THE DEALER PERFORMS A VERY LIMITED INSPECTION WITH A QUICK TEST DRIVE BEFORE THE SALE.    ALTHOUGH THE DEALERSHIP REPAIRED THE BRAKES DEFECT UNDER WARRANTY ON DEC. 22, THEY TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESULTS OF THE DEFECT OR FOR NOT PROPERLY INSPECTING THE CAR PRIOR TO SELLING IT TO ME.    THE ONLY RESPONSE I HAVE RECEIVED FROM SUBARU OF AMERICA IS THAT I SHOULD TAKE UP MY DAMAGE WITH MY INSURANCE CARRIER. IF SUBARU CAN CONTINUE TO SELL POORLY INSPECTED CARS WITH DEFECTIVE BRAKES WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.  THAT'S NOT FAIR TO ME AND CERTAINLY NOT FAIR TO ANY PERSON WHO WRECKS BECAUSE OF THE BRAKE DEFECT AND PERHAPS INJURES SOMEONE.

THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS OFF. THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON WHEN MY SONS ARE IN THE SEAT. THEY WEIGH 150# AND 160#.    I CALLED SUBARU SERVICE AND THEY SAID THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS SET TO BE ON FOR PERSONS OVER 80# AND THEY RECOMMENDED I BRING THE CAR IN TO GET CHECKED.  I TOOK MY CAR TO SUBARU SERVICE AND THEY SAID \"THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS OPERATING PROPERLY ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STANDARDS.\" I CALLED SUBARU CORPORATE OFFICE AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING. I WENT BACK TO THE SUBARU DEALER AND SAT IN TWO IDENTICAL IMPREZA OUTBACK SPORTS AND THE EXACT SAME RESULT THAT THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS OFF. I ALSO SAT IN FOUR 2009 SUBARU FORESTERS AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS OFF IN 2 OF THE 4. I SAT IN TWO 2008 LEGACY OUTBACK WAGONS AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS ON. I SAT IN TWO 2008 TRIBECAS AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WAS ON. SUBARU IS NOT BEING COOPERATIVE IN RESOLVING THE SITUATION.  *TR",
