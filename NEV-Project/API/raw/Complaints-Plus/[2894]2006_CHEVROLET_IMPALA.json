Before this happened the check engine light was on for about a week, when I scanned the vehicle with the obd-II the code for a large leak in the fuel EVAP system came up. One day while driving the vehicle I was stopped at a red light and once the light turned green I pressed the gas and the car started to sputter and move very slow also in the driver information center it intermittently showed the warnings service traction control and speed reduced. I had to pull over when safe to do so. Once I got the vehicle home I ran the scan again and it came up with the throttle body position sensor codes. The part is available for inspection. The safety of me and my passenger were in jeopardy we could've definitely been in an accident because it was so sudden when it happened. I have not taken the car to a dealer but an independent mechanic has looked at it. Vehicle has not been inspected by anyone other than me and an independent mechanic. This was a very scary experience and I have seen many forums with the same issues from GM cars. Your attention is needed and appreciated.",

MY MECHANIC SAID I NEED TO BRING THE CAR IN WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON SO THAT HE CAN READ THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DOESN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH INFORMATION.   I HAVEN'T DRIVEN SINCE AS I'M AFRAID BUT WILL DRIVE LOCALLY AND BRING THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC AS SOON AS THOSE LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN.  IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE BUT NOT WHEN I COULD BRING IT TO THE MECHANIC.  *TR",

THERE WAS A CHEVY IMPALA DRIVING SOUTH IN THE NORTHBOUND LANE (I.E. HE WAS HEADING THE WRONG WAY).   I AVOIDED HIM BY SWERVING BUT HE COLLIDED WITH A FORD EXPLORER HEADING NORTH.  THE COLLISION WAS NOMINALLY A HEAD ON, OFFSET TOWARDS THE DRIVER'S SIDE.       THE IMPALA WAS FAIRLY NEW, AFTERWARDS I CHECKED PICTURES ON THE WEB AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IT WAS A MY 2006-2012 MODEL.   THE EXPLORER WAS FAIRLY NEW AS WELL.     I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE IMPALA DRIVER WASN'T WEARING HIS SEAT BELT AND WAS UNCONSCIOUS LAYING ACROSS THE FRONT SEATS WHEN I ARRIVED.  THE WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED WHERE HIS HEAD HAD STRUCK IT.   THE HORN WAS SOUNDING AND IT LOOKED LIKE FUEL HAD BEEN SPILLED.  I WANTED TO MAKES SURE THE CAR WAS OFF TO PREVENT A FIRE SO I REMOVED THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION.  THE HORN CONTINUED TO SOUND.  IT WAS EVENTUALLY STOPPED WHEN SOMEONE DISCONNECTED THE CABLES FROM THE BATTERY.    NONE OF THE AIRBAGS IN THE IMPALA HAD BEEN DEPLOYED.  THERE WAS A KNOWLEDGEABLE VOLUNTEER NEAR BY WHO TOLD US NOT TO TOUCH THE DRIVER BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE SPINAL INJURIES.  I SPENT THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES AT THE SCENE AND PROVIDED A WRITTEN STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.  BASED UPON THE WAY THE BODY WAS HANDLED, I AM ASSUMING THE DRIVER OF THE IMPALA WAS KILLED BY THE IMPACT.      I AM SURPRISED THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH FORCE IN THE IMPACT TO KILL THE DRIVER (I ASSUME) BUT NOT ENOUGH TO DEPLOY THE AIRBAGS.  THE DRIVER IN THE EXPLORER WAS INJURED BUT HER INJURIES DIDN'T LOOK ESPECIALLY SERIOUS AND HER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.    I BELIEVE THE IMPALA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED / INSPECTED BY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL TO ESTABLISH THE ROOT CAUSE ON WHY THE AIRBAG DIDN'T DEPLOY.",

AT 101,000 MILES I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND MY TRANSMISSION STOPPED WORKING. I REFINANCED MY CAR TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION FOR $2,200 . AFTER THE REBUILD TRANSMISSION WAS WORKING OK. THEN AT 122,000 MILES IT STOPPED WORKING AGAIN... IT WAS SNOWING AND I WAS STRANDED IN THE TURN LANE OF A ROAD WITH A SPEED LIMIT OF 55MPH... I TURNED OFF MY CAR LET THE ENGINE COOL DOWN AND BACK ON AT LEAST 20 TIMES... MY CAR MOVED ABOUT 200 FEET EACH TIME... AN HOUR LATER I GOT BACK TO MY HOUSE THAT WAS 5MILES FROM THE FAILURE. I CANT AFFORD TO FIX IT NOW AND I AM STILL PAYING FOR THE CAR. ITS BEEN SITTING IN MY YARD FOR 10 MONTHS. THIS ISSUE IS VERY DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. I ALSO RECEIVED A RECALL FOR MY POWER STEERING HOSE, GOT IT FIXED AND THE BRACKETS CAME LOOSE FROM MY FRAME CAUSING MY STEERING TO GET VERY HARD. I PULLED OVER AND CHECKED MY POWER STEERING FLUID AT WALMART AND IT WAS EMPTY. I FILLED IT AND EVERYTHING WAS WORKING. THE NEXT MORNING I HAD NO POWER STEERING AGAIN... MY HOSE HAD RUBBED ON MY FRAME MAKING A HOLE. I WENT TO THE STORE AND BOUGHT MORE POWER STEERING FLUID BUT AFTER I PUT IT IN MY STEERING WAS MAKING A LOUD SOUND AND DIDN'T TURN WELL. I THINK IT WAS DAMAGED DUE TO THE LEAK. I TOO HAVE A LOUD CLICKING SOUND COMING FROM MY DASHBOARD WHEN I TURN ON MY CAR. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS THE VENT FLAP MOTOR ... $750 DOLLARS TO REPAIR... PART IS ONLY $65 THE REST IS LABOR... ALSO WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY CAR I HAD TO GET ALL 4DOOR WINDOWS REPLACED (UNDER WARRANTY) DUE TO IMPROPER WINDOW GUIDE ADJUSTMENT. AND MY AUTOMATIC TRUNK RELEASE WORKS OFF AND ON, MY KEYLESS ENTRY ONLY WORKS 5 FEET FROM MY CAR WITH NEW BATTERIES,AND ALL TIRE PRESSURE SENS. WENT BAD$100 EACH HELP.  *TR",

I THINK THERE MAY BE AN ENGINEERING OVERSIGHT:  IT STANDS TO REASON THAT HAVING USED THE KEY WITH THE WEIGHT ATTACHED FOR 8 YEARS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WORN THE INTERNAL CONNECTIONS BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE INSERTED KEY.  IT ALSO SEEMS REASONABLE, THAT NOW HAVING A KEY THAT IS LIGHT WEIGHT BEING INSERTED INTO THE SAME CHAMBER AS THE HEAVILY WEIGHTED KEY, WILL MEAN THAT THE NEW KEY WON'T FIT OR MAKE THE PROPER CONNECTION IN THE IGNITION BECAUSE THE NEW KEY WILL NOT BE AS HEAVY, AND THEREFORE THE \"FIX\" IS REALLY CREATING A NEW PROBLEM.    WHY WOULDN'T THE WHOLE IGNITION APPARATUS HAVING TO DO WITH THE KEY BE REPLACED AS WELL AS KEYS?????  I THINK THIS IS A BIG OVERSIGHT, AND A BIG PROBLEM.  ESPECIALLY SINCE ALL THE TESTIMONY I HEARD OR READ ABOUT THIS ISSUE FROM GM IS THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE \"MIS-SIZED PART\" --- I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN FROM MY DEALER THAT IT IS THE KEYS THAT ARE BEING REPLACED, AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FOBS ATTACHED.

I WORK FULL TIME, GO TO COLLEGE FULL TIME AND I RUN MY OWN HOUSEHOLD I DONT HAVE THE TIME OR MONEY TO DRIVE THAT FAR TO SIT AROUND A GARAGE FOR AN HOUR OR MORE FOR IT TO GET FIXED. NOT TO MENTION THE STRESS I ENDURE WHILE IM DRIVING IN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A RELIABLE FAMILY CAR, NOW I AM MERELY WAITING FOR IT TO GO OFF THE ROAD UNINTENTIONALLY MOVE THE KEY AWAY FROM THE RUN POSITION AND LOSE MY ENGINE POWER, POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKING AND THE AIR BAGS NOT DEPLOYING INCREASING MY RISK OF INJURY OR FATALITY?! NOW I AM SUPPOSED TO JUST REST EASY AND WAIT FOR MY FATALITY TO POSSIBLY OCCUR AT ANY MOMENT WHILE IM DRIVING MY CAR THAT I PAY GOOD MONEY FOR WHILE YOU FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEND ME A LETTER WHICH COULD TAKE MONTHS AND THEN SET ME UP AN APPOINTMENT THAT DOESNT INTERFERE WITH MY SCHEDULE WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND COULD ALSO TAKE MONTHS.

HE PULLED OVER INTO A RESTAURANT PARKING LOT BUT BY THEN THE ELECTRIC WAS OUT IN THE CAR SO THE DOORS WERE LOCKED AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR. GOOD THING HE HAD THE WINDOWS DOWN PRIOR TO THE FIRE BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS ONLY ESCAPE. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES BROUGHT OUT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND TRIED TO PUT IT OUT WITH NO LUCK. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE WAS IN THE AREA OF THE FUSE PANEL AND WIRING HARNESS. MY CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS AFTER JUST PAYING IT OFF JUST TWO WEEKS AGO! HEARTBREAKING. I'VE BEEN DOING MY RESEARCH AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED! I'M JUST THANKFUL THAT MY CHILDREN WERE NOT IN THE CAR WHEN THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE WORST COULD HAVE HAPPENED ALL BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO DO A RECALL!

THE LAMP ON THE CONTROL LIGHTS NORMALLY, BUT THERE IS NO VOLTAGE GOING TO THE REAR DEFOGGER GRID CONNECTORS (ON EACH SIDE OF WINDOW). THERE IS NO SEPARATE FUSE GOING TO THIS DEVICE, ONLY A RELAY IN THE FORWARD FUSE BOX. THE PROBLEM TURNED OUT TO BE A BURNT PIN ON THE LARGE CONNECTOR BLOCK UNDER THE KICK PANEL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.

(AS THIS CONNECTOR IS THERE FOR ASSEMBLY PURPOSES ONLY, WHY NOT JUMPER IT.)  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM WAS DUE TO EITHER A POOR CONNECTION OF THE PINS DURING MANUFACTURING (HIGH RESISTIVE CONNECTION) OR IMPROPER SIZED PINS THAT ARE NOT HEAVY ENOUGH TO CARRY THE CURRENT. AS THIS CONNECTOR IS NOT NORMALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE OWNER/OPERATOR AND DOES NOT MOVE, IT IS NOT A \"WEAR ITEM\" AND THUS WAS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE.

THE MOMENT YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE PEDDLE TO PRESS THE BRAKE, THE HEATER GOES OUT AND THE AIR TURNS COLD. THIS PROBLEM WAS FIXED IN 4/09, WHEN THE OTHER REPLACEMENT PARTS WERE FIXED.

WHEN I HAD MY CAR INTO THE DEALER LAST YEAR  (MAHOWALDS MOTORS IN NEW PRAGUE WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR) FOR THE NORMAL SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE, THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT THIS.  THE SERVICE MANAGER PULLED UP A BULLETIN FROM MARCH OF 2008 AND IT STATED THAT THIS MAKE/MODEL CAR WOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  IT TOLD THE DEALERSHIP HOW TO FIX IT (NO PARTS INVOLVED - JUST TAKING OFF SOME HOSES AS THERE WAS AIR BUBBLES OR BLOCKAGE THAT WAS CAUSING THIS - AND THEY WANTED SOME WHERE AROUND $186.00 TO DO THIS.).  I ASKED WHY THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE WHEN THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, THAT THIS MAKE OF CAR WAS GOING TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND I WAS TOLD THAT AS LONG AS WE DIDN'T BRING IT UP, THEY WERE NOT FIXING IT AS IT WAS NOT A \"RECALL\", JUST A BULLETIN LETTING THEM KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PROCESS WHEN A DEALERSHIP OR A HUGE COMPANY LIKE CHEVROLET KNOWS THERE IS A FLAW BUT SITS BACK AND KEEPS THEIR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT AND THEN WHEN CONFRONTED THE CUSTOMER IS TOLD IT WILL TAKE $186.00 TO FIX.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT BECAUSE THERE WERE NO 'PARTS' INVOLVED IN THIS REPAIR, THAT THIS WAS THE REASON IT COST THIS MUCH.....IT ALMOST MAKES IT SOUND LIKE, IF THERE DO NOT HAVE ANY PARTS COST TO FALL BACK ON, THEN THEY BOOST UP THE LABOR CHARGES.  BOTTOM LINE IS, THE BULLETIN CAME OUT IN MARCH OF 2008, AND MY CAR WAS IN EVERY 3000 MILES FOR THE OIL CHANGE, THIS 'ERROR' REPAIR SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND NOT 'HIDDEN' IN THE BACKROOM.  THIS IS MY COMPLAINT.  I HAVE TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THIS DEALERSHIP (WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW), A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND HE SAID HE CAN'T AND WON'T DO  ANYTHING ABOUT IT....I ASKED HIM TO CALL THE KEY COMPANY ON THIS AND HE SAID THAT ISN'T PART OF HIS JOB.

MY 2006 CHEVY IMPALA HAS DEVELOPED A FUEL RELATED PROBLEM THAT CAUSES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO ACTIVATE. THIS IS CAUSED BY THE USE OF E-85 FUEL.  THE COMPUTER DETECTS HIGH ALCOHOL CONTENT IN THE FUEL.  THE DEALER WAS ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH BOTH A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND BY FLUSHING OUT THE E-85 FROM THE FUEL SYSTEM AND RESETTING THE COMPUTER.  THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WAS LACK OF PROPER INSTRUCTION, FROM THE DEALER, IN THE USE OF E-85.  I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED THAT AFTER FILLING THE GAS TANK WITH E-85, THE VEHICLE MUST BE DRIVEN A MINIMUM OF 11 MILES, BEFORE SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE.  THIS GIVES THE SENSOR IN THE FUEL SYSTEM SUFFICIENT TIME TO ADJUST TO THE FUEL.  THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE IS SWITCHED FROM CONVENTIONAL E-10 GAS, TO E-85.  I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS PROCEDURE, UNTIL AFTER THE PROBLEM HAD OCCURRED.  GM SHOULD NOTIFY ALL CONSUMERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED 2006 AND 2007 VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH FLEX-FUEL ENGINES OF THIS REQUIREMENT.  AFTER THE PROBLEM OCCURS, THE DEALER NEEDS TO PERFORM THE RESET PROCEDURE FOR THE FUEL COMPUTER.  THIS PROCEDURE REQUIRES APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS.  IT IS NOT A SERIOUS DEFECT, BUT IT IS UNNECESSARY. THE DEALERS SHOULD INFORM CUSTOMERS, WHEN THE VEHICLES ARE DELIVERED, OF THIS PROCEDURE.  *JB",

THIS NOISE ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED TO THE RIGHT. I AM TRYING TO DELAY BRINGING THE CAR TO THE SHOP, BECAUSE OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING MY CAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT CARS DO HAVE DEFECTS AND JUST THOUGHT I WOULD REPORT THIS IN CASE IT IS SOMETHING SERIOUS. I WOULD HATE TO HAVE MINE OR SOMEONE ELSE'S STEERING GO OUT DURING DRIVING AND SOMEONE GET HURT. I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NO BIG DEAL, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND MAY EVERYONE HAVE A SAFE AND PROSPEROUS LIFE. *JB",
