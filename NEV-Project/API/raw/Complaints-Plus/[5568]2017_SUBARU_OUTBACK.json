        "summary": "I started having battery issues with my car. I had my car at the mechanic for a regular state inspection. They told me that I had a bad battery that it had died numerous times. I was shocked because I had never jumpstarted my car in the past. I began to believe the dealership sold me the car with a bad battery. I knew this because I tried to drive the car out of the lot when I first purchased and the battery was dead. They told me to come back the next day and they would have a new battery in it. I guessed then that they never replaced the battery. So I then purchased a new battery from the mechanic. 6 months later my car wouldn't start. I had left nothing running in the car. The next day my car started. Then 2 months later, my husband drove my car to get food. He parked the car for 5 minutes and went in to get the food. When he came back, the car wouldn't start again. We had to jumpstart it. I believe something is wrong with the car overall, causing the battery to drain without the consumer's knowledge, this is a safety concern as it leaves the consumer stranded wherever they are. My husband was left sitting there with my daughter until I could come pick them up. The outback will just die without warning.  I tried calling the dealer about it, they didn't return my call. I now scheduled an appointment to have them look at it. I will see what they say, however it seems like other consumers of this car are having the same issues.",

For a car that has less than 30,000 miles, is maintenanced regularly, taken care of and driven well, this is absurd. The dealership has acknowledged that there was a technical issue that was making the battery drain quickly, but even after reprogramming, the NEW battery still died a few months later. My research indicates there is a widely known issue with battery drainage on this model of car, and yet Subaru of America refuses to admit this or make it right, other than continuing to replace the battery again and again.

Leaving a door open for 15 mins or radio on for 4 mins without the engine running can be enough to cause the car needing a jump start to operate. Leaving an interior light on will also drain the battery but am less sure how long that needs to happen.  I had been searching forms for a solution and saw I should report it here.

        "summary": "I purchased a used 2017 Subaru Outback Premium in January 2020 from Johnson Subaru in Raleigh, NC. It was a Certified car and had a brand new Subaru brand battery as part of the prep before the sale. That battery failed on Aug 23, 2021...less than 18 months old. A Subaru dealer agreed to replace it under the 2 year battery warranty. The free replacement Subaru brand battery that was installed in my Subaru Outback in August 2021 failed on November 28. 2021...less than 4 months old.   The tests at O'Reilly Auto Parts on Nov 28th show the battery was delivering 0 volts. The alternator was tested, too, and it was providing 14 volts to the replacement battery. When Subaru installed this battery last August the Subaru Service Adviser told me that there was no warranty on a replacement battery because Subaru would only replace it once. Why aren't replacement parts guaranteed? They are brand new.  Subaru batteries are defective and cannot supply sufficient voltage to the car's electrical system. They don't last as long as their 2 year warranty. I have pictures of the battery test and the alternator test below.  Poor quality Subaru brand batteries are a known issue and Subaru should take action to provide better replacement parts and the replacement parts should also be warranted. I can't depend on Subaru brand batteries.  I bought a battery from O'Reilly while I was there at a cost of $159.95 plus tax and core. I would like for Subaru to reimburse me for at least part of that expense.",

I jumped it yesterday, drove it around, restarted it to make sure, drove it around some more and then parked it. Today it is dead. The battery voltage is fine (a bit low, perhaps) at 12.8V, when charging at 14V. If I jump the car in my driveway, run it for a while, it essentially does not charge the battery. It is almost like the car is designed not to actually charge the battery unless you drive it a lot, which seems counter-intuitive. Engine RPMs doesn't seem to affect the charging ability even though it should.  I have one after-market device installed: a remote car starter, built and installed by Subaru. Otherwise, this is a stock, 2017 Subaru Outback. All interior lights are switched off, the head lights are left in the Off position, yet the car continually dies.  When I do drive it on a daily basis, it usually is fine. However, I did have it die one time while doing a bunch of errands. Basically, drive 10 minutes, stop, run the errand, drive 10 minutes, stop, run the errand, etc. After the fourth or fifth errand the car was dead. As this is a continual problem I have a lithium power pack designed to jump the car, so that provided the rescue I needed. But I should not need this type of rescue!",

The crack starts spontaneously and spreads across the windshield. After replacing it in November 2020, we just chalked it up to bad luck, then it happened again in June. Each time, we replaced it with Subaru factory glass and had the Eyesight safety technology calibrated by the certified technician. Now it's happened again (August 2021). I've read of MANY other Subaru owners with similar experiences, and the Subaru service manager in Athens, GA admitted he sees more cracked windshields with Subarus than other makes. Please advise on how we can resolve this issue and safely drive our vehicle. Thank you.",

Once it was in the mountains where we went skiing for the day and returned to the car and the battery was dead.  The other 5-6 occasions, I did not use my car for durations ranging from a few days to 3 weeks and when i went to use it, the battery was dead.  It should not lose charge for that short of a duration of non-use.  I took it to the dealer for an electrical and battery inspection and they found no issues.  They refused to replace the battery since they said it was fine.  I decided to replace it on my own dime due to the issues.  But even after replacing it with a brand new battery, the issue has persisted.  I've had to purchase a portable charger that i carry with me at all times because I am nervous of it dying and being stranded like it did on the mountain especially because I have small children.",

Thus, not even a year passed before the windshield cracked a second time.    Once again, I assumed the windshield might have been struck while driving.  After getting a quote on replacing the windshield a second time, the crack spread an additional 12\" after the vehicle was parked outside for 4 hours.  This time, I photographed the crack.  The windshield is scheduled to be replaced on 7/27 so it will not be available for inspection after that date.  My concern is that the windshields on this vehicle crack VERY easily in response to impacts that I didn't even notice.  The cracks then spread very easily.  These cracks obstruct drivers' visibility, which presents a safety risk.   Replacing the windshields is very expensive because of the safety features require calibration.",

We also looked on this nhtsa site, realized this is a problem with other similar vehicles and a class action suit is pending.  For the past year we have learned to not keep any electrical on when the car is not running.  The last two times: within the last month.  I was waiting to pick up my child from an event, I turned the car totally off but left the key in the ignition.  This, I found out later, caused the battery to drain in 10 minutes and I was stuck.  Two weeks ago, I went to the drive in.  When pulling in, I remembered that the car battery dies but I needed the radio to hear the movie - thankfully the movie theater had a jumper as my battery died in less than 30 minutes.  No one else at the movie had this problem.  I had three kids with me and that is the point, the car was specifically purchased because Subaru advertises that they make reliable vehicles, but this car is not as does not hold a charge.  There is no warning that the battery will die.    My liftgate also once stopped working.  We googled it and had to jump the car to reset the computer to make the liftgate work again.  I went to the dealership on 6/9/21, and asked them to do a diagnostic on the battery and alternator during the annual inspection.  They said everything is fine and that they researched the problem.  They explained that this a known fault and there is nothing that can be done and Subaru has no current plans to fix.  They also said cars with FOBs drain too with just the FOB being nearby (I have a normal key).

I TAKE MY CAR INTO FARAWAY CORNERS OF THE WILDERNESS ON OCCASION.  I CANNOT RISK BATTERY DRAIN WHEN I RETURN TO MY CAR AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF ADVENTURE.  TO BE SAFE AFTER THESE INCIDENTS, I REMOVED THE LIGHTBULB FROM THE \"WAY BACK\" OF MY SUBARU OUTBACK.  I DID THIS TO AVOID ACCIDENTALLY DRAINING THE BATTERY IF I LEFT THAT LIGHT ON (EASY TO GO UNNOTICED).  FURTHER, I KEEP EACH OF THE OTHER INTERIOR LIGHT SWICH CONTROLS IN THE OFF POSITION.  I CHANGED THIS FROM THE \"ON WHEN A DOOR IS OPEN\" POSITION THAT I USED TO KEEP THE SWITCHES IN, AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT I DON'T ACCIDENTALLY DRAIN THE BATTERY.    DURING MY NEXT MAINTENANCE VISIT WITH MY SUBARU DEALER'S MAINTENANCE TEAM (AN OIL CHANGE, I BELIEVE), I DISCUSSED THE BATTERY FAILURE WITH THE TECHNICIAN.  I ASKED THE PERSON IF THERE WAS SOME WAY SET A SOFTWARE CONTROL SO THAT NO LIGHT WOULD REMAIN ILLUMINATED WITH THE ENGINE TURNED OFF FOR MORE THAN SOME SET PERIOD OF TIME (FOR INSTANCE, 10 MINUTES, OR A HALF HOUR).  THE TECHNICIAN SAID THERE WAS NO WAY TO SET THAT FOR THE CAR.    I REGULARLY CHECK TO ENSURE THAT I'M NOT LEAVING MY FRONT SEAT, OR MID-SEAT LIGHTS ON SINCE MY BATTERY HAD DRAINED ON THOSE OCCASIONS.  I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, HOWEVER, IF THE PROBLEM WAS SOME ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH MY CAR, RATHER THAN MY OWN POTENTIAL MISTAKE.

THIS HAPPENED SOON AFTER I BEGAN DRIVING ON A QUITE COLD DAY WITH THE WINDSHIELD DEFOGGER ENGAGED. SINCE IT HAPPENED LESS THAN 1 YEAR AFTER THE FIRST, I ASKED THE SERVICE REP AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP IF THE REPLACEMENT WINDOW WAS COVERED BY ANY MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY AND HE SAID NO, NOT FOR CRACKING.   AFTER SEARCHING THE WINDSHIELD CRACKING PROBLEM ONLINE, I WAS SHOCKED TO READ OF THE NUMBER OF OTHER SUBARU LEGACY/OUTBACK OWNERS OF SIMILAR MODEL YEARS AND LATER WITH IDENTICAL STORIES AND WITH SUBARU APPARENTLY DUCKING THE ISSUE BY CONTENDING THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WARRANTYING REPLACEMENT WINDOWS.

BOTH INCIDENTS WERE ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS DURING A LONG DAY OF DRIVING. DURING THE 2ND INCIDENT I TOOK PICTURES OF THE DASH TO DOCUMENT THE GAUGES.     THE DASH PHOTOS SHOW ABOUT 1/4 TANK OF FUEL REMAINING, 100 MILES UNTIL EMPTY AND NO LOW FUEL WARNING LIGHT. AAA PUT 2.5 GALLONS OF GAS INTO THE TANK, WE DROVE A FEW MILES TO THE NEXT EXIT AND FILLED UP. TANK ACCEPTED 13.5 GALLONS. SO 2.5 + 13.5 = 16 GALLONS, YET THE FUEL CAPACITY IS LISTED AS 18.5 GALLONS. SO SOMEWHERE THERE IS A DISCREPANCY OF 2.5 GALLONS. ALL THESE DETAILS AND DOCUMENTATION WAS PROVIDED TO THE LOCAL SUBARU DEALERSHIP.    WE NOTIFIED OUT LOCAL DEALERSHIP OF THE ISSUE ON 6/5/18, THEY HAD THE CAR SEVERAL DAYS AND SAID A FIX WOULD BE OUT BY END OF SUMMER. TO DATE SUBARU AND MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE A FIX FOR THE ISSUE. SO NEARLY 6 MONTHS LATER AND STILL NO FIX. THIS SAME PROBLEM WAS REPORTED TO SUBARU AS FAR BACK AS 12/2016.    HERE'S A WRITE-UP FROM 12/2016 ABOUT A PERSON HAVING AN ISSUE RUNNING OUT OF GAS.

AFTER PULLING OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE WINDSHIELD TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE CRACK, I SADLY DISCOVERED THAT ONE SECTION OF THE OUTSIDE GLASS HAD SEPARATED FROM PLASTIC BEHIND IT TO THE DEGREE, THAT WHEN RANNING MY HAND AGAINST THE OUTSIDE GLASS SURFACE,  IT CUT MY HAND.  THE SEPARATION WAS ENOUGH THAT I QUESTIONED WHETHER IT WAS SAFE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR.  I DID DRIVE THE CAR HOME.  THE NEXT DAY I TOOK THE CAR TO MY DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPT. - THEY POINTED TO A MINUTE NICK ON THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD, SO SMALL THAT I DID NOT SEE IT UNTIL IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME, AS THE \"OUTSIDE SOURCE\" CAUSING THE CRACK. I DON'T BUY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. I BELIEVE THE THE GLASS IS SO FRAGILE THAT IT SIMPLY CRACKS FROM STRESS FROM NORMAL DRIVING MOVEMENT OF THE AUTO.  AND THAT THE FRAGILE GLASS BEGINS TO SEPARATE FROM THE PLASTIC SECURELY HOLDING IT IN PLACE.    > MY COMPLAINT IS THIS:  1) THIS PARTICULAR SUBARU MODEL HAS A RECORD OF \"CRACKED WINDSHIELD\" COMPLAINTS.

AROUND TOWN IN CITY TRAFFIC, THE STEERING IS HEAVY AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  IT IS VERY TIRING TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE UNDER THESE CONDITION.  AT TIMES, IT FEELS AS IF YOU MAY SUDDENLY LOOSE CONTROL OF THE STEERING.  2.  THE VEHICLE WANDERS.  AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE VEHICLE ON CENTER OF THE LANE.  YOU MUST CONSTANTLY CORRECT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CAR ON-TRACK.  AT ONE TIME DURING ONE OF THESE CORRECTIONS, THE VEHICLE CROSSED THE LANE DIVIDER AND ALMOST IMPACTED THE VEHICLE DRIVING ADJACENT TO ME.  3.  STEERING WHEEL DOES NOT RETURN TO STRAIGHT AHEAD.

THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE AND THAT'S WHERE THE SAFETY ISSUE COMES INTO PLAY.  THE HBA FEATURE TURNS OFF HIGH BEAMS AT LOWER SPEEDS NO MATTER IF AN ONCOMING CAR IS PRESENT AND ABSOLUTELY TURNS THEM OFF AT A STOP SIGN.  THIS MAKES FOR TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS IN RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES DANGEROUS.  IN OUR COMMUNITY, FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S VERY HILLY AND CURVY WITH A LOT OF WILDLIFE AND PEOPLE WHO WALK/JOG SO SPEEDS ARE OFTEN BELOW 20 MPH, THE SPEED AT WHICH SUBARU'S MANUAL SAYS THIS FEATURE WORKS.  IF ANYTHING, WHEN THERE IS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC IN A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES HIGH BEAMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON AT NIGHT.  THIS ALLOWS FOR THE EARLIER DETECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS.  IN TALKING TO SUBARU THEY REALLY DIDN'T CARE AT ALL THAT THIS CREATED A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND OFFERED TO TELL THEIR ENGINEERS.  OF COURSE, THIS CAN BE TURNED OFF, BUT ONLY BY VISITING A DEALER AND PAYING THEM TO FIX SUBARU'S DESIGN FLAW.  NHTSA SHOULD REQUIRE SUBARU TO 1) FIX THIS FEATURE SO THAT IT ONLY DIMS HIGH BEAMS WHEN THERE IS ONCOMING TRAFFIC; AND 2) REQUIRE SUBARU OFFER TO DISABLE THE FEATURE FREE OF CHARGE AT ANY AUTHORIZED DEALER UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED.",
