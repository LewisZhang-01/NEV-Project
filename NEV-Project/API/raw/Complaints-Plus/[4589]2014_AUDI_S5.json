IT WOULD NOT RESTART. THE CAR BEHIND MANAGED TO STOP, BUT THE SITUATION LED TO CARS PASSING ME BY DRIVING INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE IN THE FACE OF INCOMING TRAFFIC.  EARLIER I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON A LOCAL HIGHWAY AT 65 MILES AN HOUR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, AND THE RESULTS COULD WELL HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INJURY.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALER, WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED AT A LITTLE OVER 23,000 MILES.  ONE MECHANIC THERE SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF FUEL PUMP IN THIS CAR WAS KNOWN TO FAIL IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST DUE TO REGIONAL HIGH TEMPERATURES; I HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY THAT.  I CAN UPLOAD THE REPAIR PAPERWORK IF THAT IS HELPFUL.",
