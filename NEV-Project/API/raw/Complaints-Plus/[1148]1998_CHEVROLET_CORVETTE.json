I just driving pulled ahead of traffic and the clutch pedal went all the way down to floor as I approached a stop light!!!  I lost all power. I didn't know what to do, but a light bulb in my head went off.  But thankfully there was no traffic and I was able to run a light and coast into a gas station and get towed.  Upon research the 1998 manual clutch design is used in newer vehicles that and its a system design flaw.  Car at shop and we are waiting for parts that are back ordered. Since transmission has to come out I'm getting all clutch stuff fixed.  But clutch wasn't bad just the Fly wheel and Master Salve.  I will send you bill when I get it.  I could have died, caused an accident, been rear ended, it was crazy.",

FORTUNATELY, IF THE REST OF THE SYSTEMS WORK, THE ENGINE WILL SHUT DOWN AFTER THE VEHICLE MOVES A SHORT DISTANCE.  I PURCHASED THIS CORVETTE IN JUNE 2003  (I HAVE OWNED OLDER CORVETTES) NOT KNOWING THERE IS THIS DEFECT WITH NOT ONLY THE 1998 CORVETTE BUT ALSO WITH THE 1997, 1999, 2000, AND 2001 CORVETTES.  BEGINNING WITH THE 2002 MODEL YEAR, THIS FEATURE WAS REMOVED.  GENERAL MOTORS HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS SITUATION FOR SOME TIME.  THEY ISSUED A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BULLETIN\" DURING SEPT. 2001.  THIS BULLETIN COVERED ABOUT THE LAST THIRD CORVETTES MANUFACTURED DURING 1998 (SERIAL #\u0019S 23355-31069), ALL OF 1999 CORVETTES (SERIAL #S 000001-33283) AND THE FIRST HALF CORVETTES MANUFACTURED DURING 2000 (SERIALS #\u0019S 000001-16233). THEY ALSO HAVE A REPAIR KIT AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM (GM PART # 88952427 OR 88952428 OR 88952428 DEPENDING ON TRANSMISSION AND EXPORT). THIS INDICATES TO ME THAT THEY KNOW THE CAR HAS A DEFECT AND ARE WILLING TO PASS FIXING THE DEFECT ON TO THE VEHICLE OWNER.     UNFORTUNATELY, THE SERIAL # OF MY 1998 CORVETTE IS 11791.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, IRONICALLY, JUST AFTER TOURING THE CORVETTE FACTORY IN BOWLING GREEN, KY. IT COST ME $250.00 AND TWO NIGHTS IN A LOCAL MOTEL TO GET MY CAR OPERATIONAL. THE CAR IS STILL NOT FIXED PROPERLY.  AFTER DISASSEMBLING THE STEERING COLUMN, THE STEERING LOCKING SYSTEM WAS RESET AND DISABLED. THE CAR'S COMPUTER SHOWS AN ERROR CODE EVERY TIME THE CAR IS STARTED. NHTSA\u0019S WEB SITE SHOWS THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OPEN ON THIS VERY PROBLEM WITH NO CONCLUSION. THIS DEFECT MAY EXIST IN OTHER GM CARS WITH THE ELECTRONIC STEERING LOCK ASSEMBLIES.  I DO KNOW THEY DON'T USE IT AFTER 2002.  *LA",

IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ON A HIGHWAY I WOULD HAVE DIE. I CALLED GMC, BUT THEY SAID THAT MY CAR DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM SO THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AT THIS TIME. ON THE WEB AND ON YOUR SITE I SEE THAT MY MODEL YEAR DOES HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I SAID TO GM I SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU WHEN I AM KILL IN THIS CAR AND MY FAMILY WILL SUE YOU FOR MILLION OF DOLLARS WHICH YOU WILL PAY ONLY TO KEEP IT OUT OF COURT AND THE NEWS PAPERS. I FEEL THAT YOU AT THE NHTSA SHOULD DO WHAT YOU SAY PEOPLE SAVING PEOPLE. IF I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU SAVE MAYBE YOU WILL HAVE DONE WHAT YOU SAY.

ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER  THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME LOCKED AGAIN AND I WAS ABLE TO UNLOCK IT MYSELF BY CLEANING OFF THE IGNITION CHIP ON THE KEY, AS I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER ON THE PREVIOUS TRIP.  THE THIRD TIME IT LOCKED UP ON ME AGAIN BUT I WAS  NOT ABLE TO UNLOCK IT.  ALL THREE TIMES I WAS AT HOME IN THE CARPORT.  THE CAR WOULD ALWAYS START, AS IN PREVIOUS TIMES, BUT THIS TIME IT WOULD DIE WHEN I TRIED TO BACK UP OR GO FORWARD.  OBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM HAD GOTTEN WORSE.  I CALLED THE TOW TRUCK AGAIN, HAD THE CAR TOWED IN AND LUCKILY IT STAYED LOCKED SO THE SERVICEMEN COULD SEE JUST WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  THEIR COMPUTERS FOUND A CODE B2587 WHICH MEANT THAT THE LOCK MODULE FOR THE STEERING COLUMN WAS FAILING INTERMITANTLY, THUS LOCKING UP THE STEERING.  THE MODULE WAS REPLACED AND SO FAR THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING FINE.  IF WHOEVER CONCERNED GOES ON-LINE TO C5-CORVETTE.COM THEN ULTIMATE BULLETIN BOARD, C5 SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS YOU WILL SEE OTHER INSTANCES OF THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM, ONE INSTANCE OF THIS HAPPENING WHILE THE CAR IS ON THE ROAD.  I HOPE THIS IS ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR YOU TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON.  I LOVE THE CAR BUT AM A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE STEERING LOCKING UP WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD EVEN THOUGH THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.  IF SOMEONE CAN HELP ME OR AT LEAST REASSURE ME OF THIS I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  REF. IN EA02-031 *CJS",
