THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO USE THE TRAILER BRAKE OVERRIDE TO STOP THE TRUCK-TRAILER COMBINATION BEFORE HITTING ANYTHING.  BRAKE FLUID WAS DRIPPING UNDER THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR.  CLOSER EXAMINATION REVEALED SEVERE CORROSION OF THE FOUR 1/4\" BRAKE LINES THAT FOLLOW THE FRAME RAIL FROM THE ABS MODULE ON THE INSIDE OF THE LEFT FRAME RAIL UP INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT TO THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE TWO FRONT WHEELS.  ONE OF THE TWO LINES FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER TO THE ABS MODULE HAD BURST.  THE RUST ON THESE 1/4\" LINES WAS FLAKING OFF IN LARGE CHUNKS.  ALSO OBSERVED VERY SIGNIFICANT RUST ON THE 3/16\" HARD LINES ON THE REAR AXLE AND THE HARD LINES MOUNTED TO THE FRAME AND BODY LEADING TO THE REAR AXLE.  THESE LINES ARE VERY CLOSE TO FAILURE.  WHAT IS FURTHER DISTRESSING ABOUT THIS SITUATION IS THAT WHEN ONE BRAKE CIRCUIT FAILED THERE WAS NONE TO VERY LITTLE BRAKING EFFECTIVENESS FROM THE OTHER BRAKE CIRCUIT.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT RIGHT TO THE FLOOR WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER DOES NOT PROVIDE INDEPENDENT BRAKING CIRCUITS LIKE IT SHOULD.

MOST OWNERS ARE PROBABLY UNAWARE THEIR VEHICLE HAS THIS DEFECT, SINCE THE TRANSMISSION PREVENTS VEHICLE MOVEMENT WHEN IN PARK. THE PARKING BRAKE ON THESE GM VEHICLES IS A DRUM BRAKE ON THE REAR WHEELS. THE EMERGENCY BRAKE DRUM, AND DISC BRAKE ROTOR IS COMBINED INTO A SINGLE UNIT ON THESE VEHICLES. PARKING BRAKE PADS ARE MOUNTED ON A CIRCULAR METAL RING, WHICH HAS ABOUT A 2 INCH GAP AT THE TOP. THE RING EXPANDS WHEN THE PARKING BRAKE IS APPLIED.  UNLIKE TYPICAL DRUM BRAKE PADS, THE CIRCULAR RING IS NOT WELL SECURED TO PREVENT UNDESIRABLE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE DRUM. USUALLY, DRUM BRAKE PADS ARE SECURED BY HEAVY SPRINGS TO KEEP THEM CENTERED WITHIN THE DRUM. ON THESE GM VEHICLES, HOWEVER, THERE IS JUST A SLIDE-IN CLIP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CIRCULAR METAL RING TO WHICH THE PADS ARE ATTACHED. THIS ALLOWS THE BRAKE PADS TO MOVE WITHIN THE DRUM WHEN THE PARKING BRAKE IS NOT IN USE. ON MY VEHICLE, THE CIRCULAR RING WAS PULLED DOWN BE GRAVITY, RESULTING IN IT CONTINUALLY RIDING AGAINST THE DRUM. THIS WORE OUT THE PADS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CIRCULAR RING TO THE POINT WHERE METAL WAS CONTACTING METAL. THIS CAUSED EXTENSIVE WEAR TO THE DRUM, REMOVING OVER 1/16 INCH OF METAL. IN FEBRUARY 2003, GM RELEASED SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER 92-05-26-002A, WHICH CALLS FOR INSTALLATION OF A SPRING CLIP RETAINER TO PREVENT PARKING BRAKE FAILURE ON THE FOLLOWING MODELS:  2002-2003 CADILLAC ESCALADE  1999-2003 CHEVY SILVERADO 1500  2000-2003 CHEVY SUBURBAN, TAHOE 1500  2002-2003 CHEVY AVALANCHE  1999-2003 GMC SIERRA 1500  2000-2003 GMC YUKON 1500  GM SHOULD HAVE DONE A RECALL.  THIS PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD AND THE TRANSMISSION MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO HOLD WHEN PARKED ON A STEEP SLOPE. A DRIVER COULD PLACE A RUNNING VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL, SET THE PARKING BRAKE, AND TAKE THEIR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL, RESULTING IN HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES.
