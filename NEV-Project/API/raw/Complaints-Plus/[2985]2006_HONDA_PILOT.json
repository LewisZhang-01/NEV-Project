WE CONTACTED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP AND ORDERED A NEW COVER (PART NUMBER 81127-S9V-A21ZC) AND CLIPS (PART NUMBER 91566-SP0-003).  WE HAD THEM INSTALLED BY THE DEALER, BUT SIX DAYS LATER THE COVER POPPED OFF FOR A SECOND TIME, AGAIN WHILE PARKED IN THE GARAGE. WE AGAIN CONTACTED THE DEALER AND WERE TOLD TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN.  THIS TIME, THE SERVICE MANAGER HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF US.  HE USED A HEAT GUN TO ATTEMPT TO MELT THE COVER BACK INTO THE PROPER SHAPE, REPLACED THE CLIPS AND ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD BE A PERMANENT FIX.  BECAUSE WE WERE NOT CONFIDENT WITH THE FIX, WE CONTACTED HONDA AMERICA AND TOOK OUT A CASE NUMBER (05085702).  HONDA AMERICA'S ONLY COMMENT WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO WORK THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP.  A MONTH LATER, THE SEAT BACK COVER CAME OFF AGAIN WHILE IN THE GARAGE.  WE AGAIN CONTACTED HONDA AMERICA TO INFORM THEM AND TO FOLLOW-UP ON OUR CASE.  THEY AGAIN TOLD US THAT WE NEEDED TO WORK THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP.  WHEN WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT OUR CASE WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE REVIEWED BUT THAT WE WOULD NOT BE CONTACTED CONCERNING THE RESULTS OF THEIR REVIEW.  WE THEN CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND WERE TOLD THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER WOULD CONTACT US.  WE ARE STILL AWAITING HIS CALLBACK.

CHECK YOUR PLUGS AND COILS     JUST WANTED TO GET THE WORD SPREAD AROUND THERE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH THE HONDA 3.5 V6 ENGINE WHICH CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE CYLINDER HEAD AND POSSIBLY THE ENTIRE ENGINE.     I DIDN'T LEARN OF THIS UNTIL RECENTLY, WHEN THE SPARK PLUG IN THE #5 CYLINDER SHOT OUT OF THE HEAD AND DESTROYED THE COIL, AND TRASHED THE THREADS. I FOUND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO, AND ALL OF THE RESULTS AREN'T GOOD.   THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH WAS THROUGH HONDA CARE DENIED MY CLAIM BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS DAMAGE FROM THE SPARK PLUG AND THEY DON'T COVER SPARK PLUGS. WHAT A LOAD. IF THEY WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME, WHAT THE HECK WOULD THEY EVER HAVE TO COVER? SORRY SIR, THERE'S A SHORT IN YOUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE INSULATION IN THE WIRES AND WE DON'T COVER DAMAGE FROM THE INSULATION... GRRRRRR... SO I CALLED HONDA AND WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN DO SOMETHING FOR US AS LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMERS - I EVEN MENTIONED THAT WE'VE GOT A HONDA CRV... SIGH...  HONDA HAS A DUTY TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL SAFE VEHICLES AND TO FIX OR PAY FOR SAFETY DEFECTS IN ITS VEHICLES,\"     \"INSTEAD, HONDA HAS REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ALLEGED DEFECT AND FORCED ITS CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS.  LIKE YOURS TRULY, ENGINE BLOWN AND NOW I OWN MONEY ON A CAR THAT I CAN NOT DRIVE.  I WANT TO START A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BUT WITHOUT A SUPPORTING INCIDENT   I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS PLEASE RESPONDS TO THIS MESSAGE.  *TR",

I DIDN'T SEE THE SMOKE AND THOUGHT MY WINDOW WAS HAZY, SO I CONTINUED DRIVING. ABOUT 1/2-1/4 MILE FROM MY HOME, I SAW A LITTLE SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND MY ENGINE BEGAN SPUTTERING. IT WAS DURING THIS TIME, I NOTICED THAT DIFFERENT INDICATOR LIGHTS BEGAN DISPLAYING. HOWEVER, MY TEMPERATURE GAUGE SHOWED NORMAL LEVELS. BECAUSE I WAS SO CLOSE TO HOME, I DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE INTO MY DRIVEWAY, WHERE I PARKED AND EXITED THE CAR AND NOTICED ADDITIONAL SMOKE AND FLAMES UNDER THE HOOD. I EXTINGUISHED THE FLAMES WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. THE HONDA DEALERSHIP SERVICE OFFICE AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATED THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE, WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO BE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE CAUSED BY THE ALTERNATOR, AND THE TIMING BELT, BATTERY, ALTERNATOR AND PORTIONS OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I WAS INFORMED THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO PREVENT THIS.  MY INSURANCE PAID FOR THE DAMAGE.

I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GET IT TURNED BUT IT DIDN'T WANT TO SPEED UP WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. I MANAGED TO GET INTO A PARKING LOT AND TURNED IT OFF.

THE VSA LIGHT WAS GONE BUT WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD DO, IT WOULDN'T MOVE. IT WAS LIKE THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON. I THEN REALIZED THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMED LIKE AS I WAS DRIVING WHEN IT HAPPENED. I'D THOUGHT THE CAR WASN'T WANTING TO RUN BUT IT WAS LIKE THE BRAKES WERE ON. ANYWAY, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS STIFF AND I COULDN'T PUSH IT AT ALL. I TRIED PUMPING THE PEDAL TO SEE IF IT WOULD RELEASE BUT EVEN THOUGH I COULD PUT THE CAR IN EITHER PARK OR DRIVE, IT WOULDN'T MOVE. IT WAS LIKE THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON OR I WAS HOLDING THE BRAKE, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS TRUE. I CALLED A NEARBY SHOP AND TWO TECHNICIANS CAME TO WHERE WE WERE. THEY CRANKED IT UP AND EVERYTHING SEEMED OKAY BUT IT WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SHOP WHERE THEY RAN EVERY TEST POSSIBLE AND DROVE IT THREE DIFFERENT TIMES BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. THEY'RE PERPLEXED AS TO WHAT'S WRONG. I CAME HOME AND GOT ONLINE ONLY TO FIND THAT THERE ARE TONS OF POSTINGS ONLINE ABOUT THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENING TO OTHERS BUT ONLY THE 2005 PILOT HAS BEEN RECALLED. HONDA, I LOVE MY PILOT AND DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF IT NOR DO I NOT WANT TO BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN THE TIME COMES.

SINCE THE LATCH IS NO LONGER ATTACHED TO THE FRAME, THE MOVEMENT OF THE MECHANISM DETERMINES IF THE REAR HATCH IS GOING TO LATCH OR NOT. WHEN IT IS LATCHED, THE ONLY ITEM SECURING THE MECHANISM IS THE PLASTIC PANELING. THE MECHANISM ITSELF IS NOT DEFECTIVE OR BROKEN HOWEVER; THE WAY THE MECHANISM HAS BEEN SECURED SEEMS TO BE THE ISSUE. THE MOST CONCERNING ASPECT IS HOW A DOOR LATCH MECHANISM COULD BECOME DISCONNECTED AND ALLOW FOR AN INCIDENT TO POSSIBLY OCCUR.  *TR",

I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED AND VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY WERE NOT DOING SOMETHING MORE TO FIND AND REMEDY THE PROBLEM.    A HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPERVISOR THEN CONTACTED ME TO REVIEW THE EVENTS AND TOLD ME HE WOULD TAKE THE ISSUE \"TO THE ENGINEERS\" BECAUSE IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL THAT 2 DRIVERS WOULD EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEM IF IT WAS DRIVER ERROR.  HE CALLED BACK AND TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINEERS (WHO DID NOT LOOK AT THE CAR) SAID IT WAS A PROBLEM CALLED BRIDGING, WHERE YOU ACCIDENTLY PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL WHILE BRAKING.  HE DID NOT ADDRESS WHY NEITHER ONE OF US  HAD EVER EXPERIENCE \"BRIDGING\" THE FIRST FEW YEARS THAT WE OWNED THE CAR, WHEN WE BOTH HAD DRIVEN IT EXTENSIVELY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.

MY HUSBAND IMMEDIATELY AND FIRMLY APPLIED THE BRAKE AND PLACED THE GEAR IN PARK.  WITH HIS FOOT ON THE BRAKE, NOT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO ROAR AT 5000 RPMS UNTIL HE TURNED IT OFF AT THE IGNITION AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

THE TACHOMETER STAYED AT THE 5000 RPM LEVEL CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL HE AGAIN TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AT THE IGNITION AFTER ABOUT 45 SECONDS.  WE WAITED A FEW MORE SECONDS AND RE-STARTED THE ENGINE AGAIN.  THAT TIME, THE ENGINE STARTED AT A NORMAL RPM AND WE DROVE HALF A BLOCK TO OUR HOUSE.  WE RECORDED A VIDEO OF THE SECOND EPISODE OF 5000 RPMS WITH A CAMERA WE HAD WITH US.  WE PROVIDED  THE VIDEO IMMEDIATELY TO AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE.  AT THE REQUEST OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, I TOOK OUR PILOT TO BRICKELL HONDA IN MIAMI ON MARCH 1.

EVENTS LEADING TO FAILURES    COMMON FILLING OF TIRES WITH HIGH PRESSURE AIR LEAD TO DISINTEGRATION OF THE VALVE STEM.  THE VALVE STEM SEPARATES AT THE THREADS FOR THE VALVE CAP, COMPLETELY EXPOSING THE TIRE FILLER VALVE.    2.  THIS EVENT HAS OCCURRED ON TWO OF THE FOUR OPERATING TIRE VALVES IN THIS 2006 HONDA PILOT.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONSEQUENCES, BUT THE EXPOSURE TO TIRE VALVE FAILURE FROM BEING EXPOSED IS OBVIOUS.    3.  CORRECTION REQUIRES THE COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE TIRE VALVE AND ITS UNDERLYING TIRE PRESSURE SENDING UNIT.    FAILURE MODE:      THIS FAILURE APPEARS TO BE A RESULT OF THE USE OF SOFT ALUMINUM IN THE TIRE VALVE STEM, THE CUTTING OF SHARP, V-SHAPED THREADS ON BOTH THE EXTERIOR TO HOLD THE VALVE CAP AND THE INTERIOR TO HOLD THE VALVE AND TIRE PRESSURE SENDING UNIT.      THE SHARPLY CUT THREADS, COMPARED TO CONICALLY CUT THREADS, RESULTS IN FRACTURE WHEN THE INTERIOR THREADS AND EXTERIOR THREADS CROSS, LEADING TO MINIMAL METAL BETWEEN THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR.  THE FAILURE IN ONE CASE OCCURRED WHEN REMOVING THE VALVE CAP, COMPLETELY EXPOSING THE TIRE VALVE ITSELF.  THE FAILURE IN THE SECOND CASE OCCURRED WHEN THE HIGH PRESSURE AIR FILLING VALVE (BRASS) ADHERED TO THE VERY SHARP EXTERIOR THREADS AND SIMPLY RIPPED THE VALVE STEM APART.   NOTE THAT THE VALVE STEM IS COMPOSED OF A SOFT ALUMINUM, RATHER THAN HARDENED BRASS OR STEEL.    I BRING THIS TO NHTSA SINCE, IN MY OPINION, THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THESE VALVE STEM FAILURES CAN LEAD TO RAPID DEFLATION OF THE SUBJECT TIRE, LOSS OF OPERATOR CONTROL, AND CONSEQUENT ACCIDENT AND INJURY IF THE VALVE STEM SEPARATES SUCH THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE TIRE VALVE IS DAMAGED.    IN MY ESTIMATION, THIS IS AS SIGNIFICANT A PROBLEM AS WAS THE HISTORIC SUDDEN TIRE TREAD SEPARATION ISSUE.   IN FACT, THIS PROBLEM CAN RESULT IN THE SAME UNEXPECTED LOSS OF TIRE INTEGRITY IF THE TIRE VALVE IS DAMAGED SUBSEQUENT TO A FAILURE IN THE VALVE THREADS. *TR",
