THE PROBLEM MATCHES EXACTLY YOUR RECALL BELOW:    NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER:   98V322000  SUMMARY:    VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: CERTAIN 1996-1999 FORD CROWN VICTORIA POLICE, FLEET, NATURAL GAS, AND 1996-1999 LINCOLN TOWN CAR LIMOUSINE VEHICLES THAT WERE PRODUCED WITH A LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT CONTAINING A ONE PIECE BEARING; AND 1990-1996 FORD CROWN VICTORIA POLICE, FLEET, AND NGV VEHICLES AND 1990-1996 LINCOLN TOWN CAR LIMOUSINE VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN SERVICED WITH EITHER A BALL JOINT CONTAINING THE ONE-PIECE BEARING OR A FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM CONTAINING A BALL JOINT WITH A ONE-PIECE BEARING. THE ONE-PIECE BEARING WITHIN THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT CAN WEAKEN SLOWLY DURING USE AND EVENTUALLY CRACK. THIS COULD RESULT IN SEPARATION OF THE BALL AND CAP OF THE JOINT, ALLOWING THE CONTROL ARM TO DROP TO THE GROUND.  CONSEQUENCE:    IF THIS OCCURS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING, REDUCED STEERING CONTROL COULD OCCUR, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  REMEDY:    DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINTS (2).  NOTES:    OWNER NOTIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN JANUARY 18, 1999. OWNERS WHO TAKE THEIR VEHICLES TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER ON AN AGREED UPON SERVICE DATE AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-800-392-3673. ALSO CONTACT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S AUTO SAFETY HOTLINE AT 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236).     WE NEVER RECEIVE NOTICE OF ANY RECALL.

        "summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM YOU ABOUT A SAFETY PROBLEM WITH CERTAIN LINCOLN TOWN CAR MODELS.  I AM THE OWNER OF A 1996 LINCOLN TOWN CAR (SIGNATURE SERIES).    ON JUNE 16, 2006,  WHILE DRIVING IN TOWN WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING ON, I  SAW SMOKE POURING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND ANTIFREEZE LEAKING FROM UNDER THE CAR.  AFTER OPENING THE HOOD I SAW ANTIFREEZE ALL OVER THE ENGINE BLOCK.  I MANAGED TO DRIVE THE CAR TO A NEARBY JIFFY LUBE.  THE TECHNICIAN THERE COULD NOT FIND ANY LEAKS IN THE HOSES OR THE RADIATOR.  AFTER ALLOWING THE CAR TO COOL FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES, THE TECHNICIAN FILLED THE RADIATOR WITH A 50-50 ANTIFREEZE-WATER MIXTURE.  I STARTED DRIVING HOME, ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY.  BEFORE I ARRIVED, THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE REACHED THE MAXIMUM POINT, AND THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE ALARM SOUNDED.  I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE CAR AND OPENED THE HOOD.  AGAIN, I SAW ANTIFREEZE ALL OVER THE ENGINE.  WHEN THE CAR HAD COOLED, I CHECKED THE COOLANT LEVEL: IT WAS COMPLETELY DRY!  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL GARAGE, WHERE THE MECHANIC FOUND A TWO-INCH CRACK AT THE REAR OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD!  THIS MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF FORD VEHICLES HAD EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH INTAKE MANIFOLDS, WHICH WERE FABRICATED FROM PLASTIC, RATHER THAN METAL.  HE SAID THAT DOZENS OF NORTH CAROLINA HIGHWAY PATROL CARS (CROWN VICTORIAS EQUIPPED WITH THE SAME 4.6-LITER ENGINE THAT'S IN MY LINCOLN) HAD BEEN RECALLED BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE INTAKE MANIFOLDS.  THIS KIND OF PROBLEM WARRANTS A SAFETY RECALL.  IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF A CAR BEING DRIVEN ON AN INTERSTATE WERE TO SUDDENLY LOSE ALL OF ITS COOLANT FROM A LEAKING INTAKE MANIFOLD!     IN VIEW OF THE SAFETY HAZARDS A LEAKING INTAKE MANIFOLD CAN (AND DOES) CREATE, I BELIEVE THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COSTS I INCURRED FOR A NEW MANIFOLD AND THE LABOR TO INSTALL IT.   (I KEPT THE DEFECTIVE MANIFOLD, IN CASE YOU WANT TO INSPECT IT.)  *NM",

I HAVE COME ACROSS A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE FOUND OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING. THE INTAKE MANIFOLD ON THE 4.6 LITER ENGINE. THIS ENGINE IS COMMON IN THE BIG FORD CAR. MY CAR DEVELOPED THIS PROBLEM AFTER 136,000 MILES. SO WHEN I STARTED LOOKING FOR THE PART I HAD A PROBLEM FINDING IT. AFTER A LONG SEARCH I STARTED GETTING THE SAMETHING, WE ARE OUT OF THE PART, AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAD THE PART WANTED JUST AS MUCH OR MORE THAN THE PART COST NEW.  THEN I WAS TOLD BY A PERSON AT THE JUNK YARD THAT I SHOULD CHECK TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL BECAUSE HE STATED THAT HE GETS A LOT OF CALLS  ON THIS SAME PART.  I CALLED FORD AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE PART, SEVEN YEARS. MY WARRANTY EXPIRED LAST YEAR. SO I STARTED DOING RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. SO I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP. I WENT ON 8/18/2004 AND I ASKED ABOUT THIS AND A MECHANIC TOOK ME TO A WORK STATION AND ON THE FLOOR WAS 4 INTAKES ALL WITH THE SAME THINGS, CRACKED! I WROTE FORD AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT DO ANY THING FOR ME, MY TIME HAS EXPIRED. NOW I AM OUT OF A CAR WITH NO JOB AND NO MONEY AND FORD WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING FOR YOU TO LOOK INTO. FORD SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL!  I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS MATTER. PLEASE CONTACT ME!",
