MY SON WAS ABLE TO BRAKE AND STEER TO AVOID THE COLLISION BUT STILL IMPACTED THE OTHER CAR'S LEFT REAR QUARTER-PANEL.  AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT, HIS AIRBAG DEPLOYED BUT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT SEPARATED FROM THE STEERING COLUMN AND EXITED THE VEHICLE.  HE RECEIVED MAJOR FACIAL LACERATIONS AND FRACTURES IN ADDITION TO AN GAPING WOUND IN HIS WRIST.  HE WAS TOLD BY SEVERAL ATTORNEYS THAT SINCE HIS CAR HAD JUST PASSED THE STATUTE OF REPOSE GATE OF 15 YR, HE COULD NOT HOPE TO BRING SUIT AGAINST HONDA/TAKATA.  TO DATE, THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY EFFORT TO EXTEND THE RECALL PRIOR TO 2002 FOR HONDA VEHICLES.  WHEN THE EXTERNAL CAR DAMAGE IS COMPARED TO THE DAMAGE INSIDE HIS VEHICLE, HIS EXTENSIVE INJURIES, AND IMAGES OF THE AIR BAG HARDWARE ARE STUDIED, THERE IS SUFFICIENT REASON TO SUSPECT THE HONDA AIR BAG'S DETONATION RATHER THAN DEPLOYMENT WAS THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO MY SON'S INJURIES.  I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING BEHIND A STATUTE OF REPOSE BUT IN THIS CASE SUSPECT A DESIGN DEFICIENCY EXISTED PRIOR TO THE CAR'S AGE EXCEEDING THE ARBITRARY 15 YR GATE.*DT*JB  *TR",

FOR SOME UNSEEN, ODD AND POSSESSIVE REASON, MY GAS PEDAL GOT STUCK TO THE FLOOR AND BEGAN TO ACCELERATE TO 65 MPH ON A 30 MPH ROAD. NORMALLY I\u0019VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF HONDA AUTOMOBILES AND PRODUCTS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND HAVE A CLEAN DRIVING RECORD.

WHILE I WAS DRIVING, MY CAR WAS RED LINING (BECAUSE OF THE BLOWN SPEED SENSOR OR THROTTLE GAUGE ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT FIXED MY VEHICLE), IT CAUSED ME TO QUESTION WHY I DRIVE. AS I CAME ACROSS A FAIRLY BUSY ROAD, I TRIED TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN BY PRESSING AS HARD AS POSSIBLE ON THE BRAKE AND PUTTING THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL (WHICH DID SLOW THE CAR DOWN SLIGHTLY), BUT ONLY TO 10-15MPH. I WAS THEN FORCED WITH HITTING AND POSSIBLY INJURING/KILLING PEOPLE ON THE FORTHCOMING STREET IN MINNEAPOLIS (26TH AND HENNEPIN), BUT INSTEAD WAS ABLE TO USE A DUMPSTER IN A PRE-EXISTING ALLEYWAY AS A BUFFER TO SLOW MY CAR DOWN TO A SAFE SPEED WHERE I COULD PULL THE E-BRAKE, PUT THE VEHICLE INTO PARK AND THEN TURN THE CAR OFF.     I DO HAVE INSURANCE AND WASN'T INJURED, BUT I WILL NEED A NEW BUMPER, FRONT BUMPER SIDE SKIRT AND NEW RIM/TIRE TOTALING OVER $2000.

THE LIGHT TURNED ON WENT BACK TO ROCK HONDA , THEY RECOMMENDED ME REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AND MENTIONED TO ME THERE IS NO RECALL ON THE A/T OR WARRANTY , THE ESTIMATE WAS $2900 FOR THE REPAIR. SO I DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION, AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING THE A/T NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED! I ENDED UP REPAIRING IT COSTING ME $2608.11 OUCH. I BELIEVE HONDA SHOULD HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY AND  NOTIFY THE MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS THAT OWN HONDA CIVICS AND    TELL THEM ABOUT THIS MAJOR REPAIR  BY ISSUING A RECALL. I FEEL HONDA SHOULD REIMBURSE ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO UNKNOWINGLY HAVE HAD TO FIX THEIR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION JUST LIKE I HAVE. NOW I'M WONDERING IF I SHOULD EVER BUY A HONDA AGAIN! PLEASE HELP.                                THANK YOU.  *LA",

HONDA DID AGREE TO GIVE ME AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 7 YEARS OR 75,000 MILES.  THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED WITH A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION IN JULY 2001.  I DID NOT WANT A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION OR A CTV TRANSMISSION.  I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OF THE TRANSMISSION IS DEFECTIVE, BUT I WAS GIVEN NO CHOICE.    IN MAY 2002 I STARTED REPORTING PROBLEMS WITH THIS REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION -- LESS THEN A YEAR AFTER IT WAS INSTALLED.  LIKE THE FIRST TRANSMISSION, THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, THE DEALERS COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.  I JUST HAD TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL IT GOT SO BAD THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD MISS THE PROBLEM -- JUST LIKE WITH THE FIRST TRANSMISSION.  WELL, FINALLY AS OF AUGUST 1, 2003, THEY CONFIRMED THE TRANSMISSION WAS THE PROBLEM AND THAT SEVERAL PARTS HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  IN THE MEANTIME, WHILE WAITING FOR THE PARTS, I'M STUCK DRIVING A CAR OVER 100 MILES A DAY TO COMMUTE TO WORK.      ULTIMATELY THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE TRANSMISSION IS BAD.  PERIOD!  IT'S A BAD DESIGN OR I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TWO OF THE SAME TRANSMISSION TYPE FAILING IN THE SAME CAR.   WHEN  I WAS LOOKING AT THIS CAR TO PURCHASE THE SALESMAN TOLD ME THIS CTV TRANSMISSION WAS SO GREAT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE IN ALL OF THE HONDA ACCORDS STARTING THE NEXT MODEL YEAR.  THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I WONDER WHY!      I FEEL VERY STRONGLY AFTER READING MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE NHTSA THIS MODEL YEAR TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE UNDER DEFECT INVESTIGATION.

I ASKED HIM IF MY CAR WOULD BE OK TO DRIVE AROUND WITHOUT REPLACING IT, HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW. IT COULD DIE ON ME IN A WEEK, OR IN A YEAR. SO FAR, MY CAR IS STILL RUNNING.

WITH RESPECT TO DRIVING, THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER CLAIMS THAT THIS POSES NO SAFETY ISSUE.  I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.  THE WARPING HAS RESULTED IN SEVERE SHIMMYING IN THE CAR (AND, AT SOME SPEEDS, A HARD AND SUDDEN PULL) UPON APPLICATION OF THE BRAKES, AFFECTING BOTH STEERING AND STOPPING, AND OVERALL HANDLING.  DESPITE THE CAR'S RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE, THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER (SF HONDA) HAS DEEMED THIS TO BE A \"REGULAR\" WEAR AND TEAR ITEM, AND THUS ONLY MACHINED DOWN THE ROTORS TO RESOLVE THE MOST RECENT WARPING.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF (OR EXPERIENCED) SUCH ROTOR WARPING IN 15 YEARS OF DRIVING.  I AM ALSO CONFIRMING BY LETTER (COPIED TO THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER) THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I WAS ALMOST HIT BY TRAFFIC BEHIND ME, AND HAD TO WAIT ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO RESTART AFTER THE ICE MELTED. THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED SEVERAL MORE TIMES THE SAME DAY AND CREATED HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE ENGINE WAS BARELY ABLE TO RUN AND WAS VERY ROUGH. UPON REACHING AN AREA WHERE THE AIR WAS DRY, IT RAN FINE. THIS HAS HAPPENED EVERYTIME, I HAVE OPERATED THE VEHICLE IN COOL/MOIST CONDITIONS, YET HONDA CLAIMS THAT THEY KNOW OF NO PROBLEM ON THIS MODEL WITH CARBURETOR ICE. MY CONTACT WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THIS MODEL VIA INTERNET, INDICATES THAT MANY OWNERS OF THIS MODEL HAVE CARBURETOR ICE PROBLEMS UNDER THE CONDITIONS I HAVE DESCRIBED.
