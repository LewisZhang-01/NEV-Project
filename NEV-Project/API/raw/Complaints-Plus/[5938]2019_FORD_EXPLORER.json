The problem is repeatable and the HORN is currently in a FAILED state. The HORN has not been diagnosed or repaired.  It has not been confirmed, by the Dealer, nor Independent Service Center.    WHY?  For them to bill me some ungodly amount, just to tell me, my the HORN DOES NOT WORK..   ON a vehicle I financed/purchased 4 months ago? and that I paid $200 last month for a FAILED BATTERY last month.   Good LORD, and on a vehicle with more automated driver assist sensors, than a MARTIAN LAND EXPLORER?  and the HORN FAILS?
