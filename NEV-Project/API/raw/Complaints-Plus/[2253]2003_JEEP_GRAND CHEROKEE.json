ON EXAMINATION, I FOUND THE CAR'S FRAME HAD FAILED AND RIPPED AWAY WHERE THE RIGHT REAR CONTROL ARM ATTACHES TO THE FRAME.  THE CONTROL ARM MOUNT IS ON THE FRAME THAT CAME LOOSE, ALLOWING THE REAL AXLE TO SHIFT BACKWARDS SEVERAL INCHES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND I EXPECT RUST BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF THE DISINTEGRATION OF SEVERAL INCHES OF FRAME.  THE SHEET METAL USED FOR THE FRAME APPEARS TO BE THIN, PERHAPS 20 GAUGE STEEL.  THE REST OF THE VEHICLE IS IN GREAT CONDITION, AND IS DRIVEN DAILY BY MY WIFE.  I AM GLAD I WAS DRIVING WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  I REPORTED THIS FAILURE TO MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER (GOLDSTEIN CHRYSLER, LATHAM NEW YORK) AND TO THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE. NEITHER OFFERED ANY HISTORY ON SUCH A PROBLEM.  I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON TO HAVE SUCH A FAILURE, AS THIS IS A COMMON VEHICLE.  I WILL TAKE PHOTOS TO DOCUMENT WHAT THE DAMAGE TO THE FRAME LOOKS LIKE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD THEM.

I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE NOISE AND BASICALLY OVERLOOKED IT FOR MONTHS.  ONE DAY WHEN GETTING INTO THE CAR IN A PARKING LOT I LANDED IN THE BACK SEAT.  AS I WAS GETTING INTO THE CAR THE DRIVER SEAT TILTED BACKWARDS LIKE A ROCKING CHAIR AND I WAS HALFWAY DUMPED HEAD FIRST (UPSIDE DOWN) INTO THE REAR OF THE CAR.  I WAS NOT INJURED.  I LOOKED UNDER THE SEAT AND WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT THE SEAT FRAME IS BOLTED TO THE CAR AND THAT THE FRONT OF THE SEAT IS ATTACHED TO THE SEAT FRAME BY TWO VERY THIN \"CAST IRON\" BRACKETS.  THE TWO BRACKETS (LEFT AND RIGHT) HAD BOTH SIMPLY SHEARED OFF AND THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING THE FRONT OF THE SEAT TO THE SEAT FRAME (THE REAR OF THE SEAT IS STILL ATTACHED TO THE FRAME). I SPECULATE THAT THE BRACKETS JUST GAVE OUT OVERTIME FROM THE SIMPLE ACTIVITY OF GETTING INTO AND OUT OF THE CAR.  I WAS LUCKY THE CAR WAS PARKED AND I WAS SIMPLY GETTING INTO THE CAR WHEN THE BRACKETS GAVE OUT.  IF IN FACT I HAD BEEN REAR-ENDED I EXPECT I WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE SEAT (SEAT BELTS OR NOT) AND SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.  I REPORTED THIS ON THE JEEP FACEBOOK PAGE SO OTHER FOLKS COULD BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER.  JEEP RESPONDED TO ME ON   FACEBOOK, EMAIL AND TELEPHONE BUT BASICALLY SAID IT WAS A 10 YEAR OLD CAR AND THE DEFECT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM - SORRY!    WHEN LOOKING ONLINE TO FIND OUT HOW TO REPAIR THE SEAT I DISCOVERED WHAT APPEARS TO BE THOUSANDS OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME EXACT DEFECT.  IN FACT COMPANIES HAVE BEEN STARTED TO MAKE FRAMES AND BRACKETS JUST TO FIX THIS DEFECT AND I AM FEARFUL THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED IN ACCIDENT (OR KILLED) BECAUSE OF THE DEFECT.  IN MY OPINION NO ONE SHOULD BE DRIVING AROUND IN A 2003 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE UNLESS THE DEFECT IS REPAIRED.  *TR",

JUST OVER 1 YEAR LATER IN AUGUST OF 2007, I NOTICED THAT THE ABILITY TO DIRECT AIR TO SPECIFIC VENTS, STOPPED WORKING, NOW THE AIR JUST BLOWS INTO THE DASH. I HAVE GONE BACK TO THE DEALER, WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE RECIRCULATE DOOR, WHICH WAS SUPPOSE TO BE CHANGED WHEN THE BLEND DOORS WHERE REPLACED, ACCORDING TO THEIR \"TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN\", WHICH WAS NOT DONE WHEN THE BLEND DOORS WHERE REPLACED. THE COST TO DO THE REPAIR WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $1000 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS AS WHEN THE BLEND DOORS WHERE REPLACED, EXCEPT THIS TIME THEY WILL REPLACE THE RECIRCULATE DOORS.

THE DOOR IS NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE THIS FORCE AND EVENTUALLY THE DOOR ITSELF ACTUALLY BREAKS.    PLEASE NOTE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN -3 CELSIUS WEATHER IN MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO, CANADA.    I WILL BE TAKING MY 2003 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE IN FOR WARRANTY SERVICE.  IF THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY I AM LOOKING AT A BILL TO FIX BETWEEN $300-$1500 CANADIAN. AFTER GOING TO DEALERSHIP WITH WARRANTY CLAIM WILL CALL 1-800# AND PROVIDE DETAILS FROM DEALERSHIP VISIT.  THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY DEFECT SINCE COULD AFFECT DEFROSTING OF WINDSHIELD WHILE    DRIVING. ALSO VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO DRIVE WITH NO HEAT (IN WINTER)  AND NO AC (IN SUMMER)  PLEASE RESPOND TO MY COMPLAINT ASAP.  THANK YOU    I HAVE READ SEVERAL POSTS ON THE INTERNET THAT JEEP FROM 1998-2004 ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.    UPDATE: I HAVE RECEIVED SERVICE FOR JEEP ON JANUARY 21, 2008  I HAVE PUT IN A COMPLAINT ON JAN. 21/08 REFERENCE # 17140103  ISSUE WAS BLEND DOOR FAULT. THE BLENDER DOOR ON LEFT SIDE WAS MELTED.  PARTS REPLACED:  05012743 HOUSING 24-028-025  05134353 HOUSING 24-028-025  TOTAL PARTS AND LABOR $473.27   PLEASE FOLLOWUP WITH CHRYSLER WHY THIS IS A NOT A RECALL.

THE PART FAILURE APPEARS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THE JEEP MODELS WITH DUAL CLIMATE CONTROL BASED ON THE HUNDREDS OF ONLINE FORUMS DESCRIBING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE HVAC \"RECIRC\" DOORS AND THE \"BLEND\" DOORS.  MY PROBLEM WAS THE RECIRC DOOR HAD BROKEN LOOSE AND HAD FALLEN DOWN COVERING THE VENT SYSTEM ENTIRELY, IN EFFECT, WE HAD NO HEAT, NO A/C AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NO DEFROST. VIRGINIA STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT THE VEHICLE MUST HAVE DEFROST TO PASS THE STATE SAFETY INSPECTION. I DID THE REPAIR MYSELF AFTER READING HOW DAIMLER/CHRYSLER HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE DESIGN FAULT. NOW, ANYONE WHO HAS THESE MODEL JEEP'S WILL HAVE TO PAY $1200.00 AND UP FOR A REPAIR THAT BREAKS AGAIN DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM USING THE SAME FAULTY PARTS. THE PLASTIC DOOR STOPS BREAK OFF FIRST, THEN DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN, THE DOOR FINALLY BREAKS OFF AND FALLS DOWN BLOCKING ALL AIRFLOW FROM THE HEATING AND AIR SYSTEM. A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ISSUED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I ORDERED FROM EBAY, TWO KITS FROM SOMEONE IN TEXAS WHO OFFERS REPLACEMENT STAINLESS STEEL HARDWARE THAT REPLACES THE RECIRC DOORS AND BLEND DOORS. THE KITS COST ME $232.00 DOLLARS AND ABOUT 16 HRS LABOR ALONG WITH BLOODY KNUCKLES. I DECIDED TO NOT WASTE TIME GOING TO A DEALER AND GETTING DENIED REPAIRS DUE TO NO RECALL. THE KITS I USED WERE CALLED HEATERTREATER. I REPAIRED BOTH RECIRC AND BLEND DOORS EVEN THOUGH THE BLEND DOORS WERE NOT A PROBLEM YET.

MY DRIVING PATTERN FOR THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN WITHIN DOWNTOWN CITY LIMITS AND CONNECTING FREEWAYS WHERE SPEEDS OVER 50 MILES PER HOUR ARE RARE DUE TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION.  ON A RECENT INTERSTATE TRIP WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES AT SPEEDS ABOVE 45 MPH THEY PULSATED AND THE FRONT END WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY EACH TIME THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A JEEP DEALER FOR AN INSPECTION. THE CAR HAD WARPED FRONT BRAKE ROTORS. PRIOR TO PROCEEDING WITH THE REPAIR I CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER TO AUTHORIZE THE REPAIR AT THEIR COST AS THE PROBLEM IS A KNOWN DESIGN/MANUFACTURING DEFECT AFFECTING 1999 THROUGH 2004 GRAND CHEROKEES. AFTER OVER AN HOUR ON THE, PHONE THEY AUTHORIZED REPLACEMENT ROTORS AS A GOODWILL REPAIR ALBEIT WITH THE ORIGINAL DEFECTIVE ROTOR DESIGN. I LEARNED FROM THE DEALER SERVICE REP THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS REPLACED THE ROTORS IN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND 1999 -2004 MODEL GRAND CHEROKEES. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A 100% FAILURE RATE.    ANY ABNORMAL BRAKE OPERATION IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE. STOPPING DISTANCE WILL BE INCREASED BY COMPROMISED INEFFICIENCY OF THE WARPED ROTOR AGAINST THE DISC. FROM A HUMAN FACTOR STANDPOINT THE DRIVER IS DISTRACTED AT A CRITICAL POINT IN BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP. INSTINCT MAY CAUSE THE DRIVER TO EASE OFF THE BRAKES TO REDUCE THE VIBRATION THEREBY RISKING A COLLISION OR LOSS OF CONTROL AND VEER INTO OPPOSING TRAFFIC.     I UNDERSTAND FROM THE DEALER THERE IS AN AFTER-MARKET FIX TO THE FACTORY ROTORS. DAIMLER CHRYSLER SHOULD ON THEIR OWN PROVIDED AN ENGINEERING CHANGE TO EXISTING REPLACEMENT ROTORS TO CORRECT THE HEAT PROBLEM AND IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH THE NHTSA SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR GAVE ME A BUSINESS CARD WITH \"CENTER SEAT BELT $166.75 BEFORE TAX\". I THEN CALLED HIM BACK TODAY AND ASKED HIM (JOHN LICKA) TO FAX ME A FORMAL ESTIMATE AND HE DID SO WHICH SAYS $84.00 LABOR AND $61.75 PARTS \" FOR ANOTHER TOTAL OF 145.75 BEFORE TAXES. I CALLED THE JEEP CORPORATION AND THEY OFFERED TO PAY FOR THE PART AND ME PAY FOR LABOR. I THEN SPOKE TO MR. SNYDER WHO IS THE SERVICE MANAGER AND MR. SIDESPINNER (GENERAL MANAGER) WHO INFORMED ME THAT SINCE I HAD 42,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE HE COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  THIS ISN'T A MONEY ISSUE. BUT HE HAD THE ATTITUDE THAT AFTER 36,000 MILES,,OH WELL. THEY ARE PUTTING THE GENERAL PUBLIC AT RISK BUT EVEN MORESO NOW, MY GRANDCHILDREN!!!  MR. SIDESPINNER HAD THE MENTALITY THAT SO ARE BRAKES AND OTHER THINGS ON A VEHICLE A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT WE AS CONSUMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THESE OTHER ITEMS. IS IT TO THE POINT NOW THAT WHEN WE HAVE OUR 36,000 MILE MAINTENANCE DONE, WE SHOULD HAVE ALL OUR SEAT BELTS REPLACED TOO? MR. LICKA DID INFORM JEEP CHRYSLER CORP. THAT IS WAS NOT ABUSED OR CAUSED BY ME. PLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. DO WE WAIT FOR MANY PEOPLE OR CHILDREN TO DIE BEFORE WE GET A RECALL?????

THE REPAIRS WERE DONE AT 2 DIFFERENT JEEP-CERTIFIED SERVICE FACILITIES, AND FOCUSED ON DECARBONIZATION CLEANINGS. BASED ON THE INVOICES AND MY OWN RESEARCH, IT'S CLEAR THIS PROBLEM HAS SEVERAL INTERRELATED FACTORS: MULTIPLE CYLINDER MISFIRES, AND EXHAUST VALVE OBSTRUCTION WITH EXCESSIVE CARBON BUILDUP. FURTHER, IT IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO SHORT-TRIP/CITY DRIVING.  A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE SECOND REPAIR, I HAD AN INDEPENDENT (NON-JEEP) ACE-CERTIFIED MECHANIC INSPECTION. HIS FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE MISFIRES CONTINUE; THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM APPARENTLY PERSISTS.  IN THE BIG PICTURE, JEEP DID ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM IN TSB-09-003-03, ENCOMPASSING A SPAN OF MODELS, FROM 1999 TO 2004, W/ 4.0L ENGINES. THE TSB PRESCRIBES A VALVE CHECK AND POSSIBLE CLEANING, BUT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MISFIRES AND CARBON BUILD-UP.   IN THE SMALLER PICTURE, I MIGHT MENTION: THE JEEP REPRESENTATIVE A/W THE JULY REPAIR TOLD ME THIS PROBLEM WAS THE RESULT OF USING 'CHEAP GASOLINE'.  THIS THEORY IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANYTHING I'VE LEARNED IN MY OWN RESERACH. IT IS JUST NOT FEASIBLE THAT GASOLINE GRADE COULD CAUSE SUCH AN EXTENT OF CARBON BUILD-UP TWICE IN 6 MONTHS, ESP WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE.     I SHOULD PROBABLY ALSO ADD THAT I DON'T KNOW THE ABSOLUTE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM. THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF REFERENCE MATERIAL ONLINE ID'ING THIS AS A CHRONIC PROBLEM W/ GRAND CHEROKEE, YET NO CLEARCUT PERMANENT SOLUTION.   I HAVE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ON WHAT I STATE HERE, AND WILL BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IN WRITING IF THAT WILL HELP.  LASTLY- SINCE MOST OF MY VEHICLE USE IS SHORT-TRIP CITY DRIVING, I AM WORRIED THAT I MAY FACE LONG-TERM INCONVENIENCE, EXPENSE, AND SAFETY RISKS.

THE REASON I NOW OWN THIS VEHICLE IS BECAUSE THE FIRST JEEP THEY SOLD ME FEEL UNDER THE NC LEMON LAW AND THE INFORMATION WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO ME BEFORE I PURCHASED THE FIRST JEEP AND I RETURNED IT 3 TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM THE DRIVESHAFT.    THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE IS YOU CAN NOT PUT IT IN 4 WHEEL DRIVE UNLESS YOU USE BOTH HANDS AND PUSH HARD ON THE FLOOR TO SHIFT THE GEAR, THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE THE TRANSFER CASE, BUT WHEN THEY CALLED ANOTHER DEALER THEY HAD REPLACED THE CASE IN 2 OTHERS AND SAID THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE, THAT IT WOULD NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THEY REPLACED IT.  SO FAR THEY HAVE NOT REPLACED IT.  IT MAKES A HUMMING NOISE WHILE SITTING IDLE AT A STOP LIGHT, AND MADE A LOUD CLINGING SOUND WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE, (TOOK IT BACK TWICE BEFORE THEY FIXED IT)  THEY SAID IT WAS NORMAL FOR THE CLINGING SOUND THE SECOND TIME I TOOK IT IN IT COST THEM 1300 TO FIX \"NOTHING\".     I STILL HAVE THE HUMMING IT'S WORSE NOW, AND THE CLINGING NOISE COMES AND GOES. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHY.  WHEN I CALLED MR. GILLILAN AT THE DEALERSHIP,  HE SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT\"  HE SAID THE ONLY CHOICES I HAD WAS TO TRADE AGAIN BUT IT WOULD COST ME MONEY, OR LET THEM KEEP TRYING UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED, HOW CAN THEY FIX THE PROBLEM IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE.  I HAVE MISSED WORK HOURS AND DAYS DEALING WITH THESE CHRYSLER VEHICLES.  I WOULD TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS BUT THEY DON'T KNOW TO TELL ME.  I CAN'T HAVE IT LOOKED AT BY ANY ONE ELSE BECAUSE IT WOULD VOID MY WARRANTY.  IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE THE CAR BUT I THINK IF I'M PAYING ALL OF THIS MONEY FOR THIS VEHICLE I SHOULD BE HAPPY, BY AT THIS TIME I'M VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND THE ANSWERS I'M RECEIVING FROM THIS DEALER.  I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *LA",
