        "summary": "I HAVE A ROADDOG 24 FOOT CARGO TRAILER 2006 PURCHASED IN 2007.  ABOUT A YEAR AFTER I PURCHASED IT I PUT NEW 5200 POUND AXLES AND NEW KENDA TIRES ON IT BECAUSE I FELT THE 3500 POUND AXLES WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH.  I CONTACTED KENDA ABOUT DEFECTS IN THE TIRES I WAS GIVEN A BIG RUN AROUND.  THEY WERE TO SEND ME SHIPPING LABELS TO SEND TIRES BACK BUT NEVER DID.  I WAS TAKING THE TRAILER TO ONE OF THERE TIRE STORES THAT IS ABOUT 50 MILES FROM ME AND ONE OF THE TIRES BLEW.  DAMAGING THE WHEEL WELL AND TRAILER BRAKE WIRES PLUS IT MADE ME SWERVE OFF THE ROAD SIDE SWIPING A YELLOW SIGN DOING DAMAGE CLEAR DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES (THEY ARE A LITTLE OVER ONE YEAR OLD AND THEY HAVE MORE THAN HALF THE TREAD LEFT) IS THAT THEY START GETTING AIR BUBBLES IN THE SIDEWALLS.  NOT LITTLE ONES BUT LONG ONES AROUND ALMOST NEXT TO THE RIM.  I HAVE FIVE OF THESE TIRES BOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY ARE ALL SHOWING SIGNS OF THIS.   THE ONE TIRE THAT BLEW THE WHOLE TREAD CAME OFF AND YOU CAN SEE SIGNS OF WHERE THE TREAD HAD BEEN SEPARATING.  THIS WAS SHOWN TO A DOT OFFICER AND HE AGREED THAT THE TRIES HAVE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  KENDA IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THESE TIRES SHOULD BE RECALLED.  ADDED   THE TRAILER IS A ROAD DOG MADE BY DIAMOND CARGO BUT IT IS NOT LISTED IN THE LIST SO I HAD TO PUT SOMETHING IN THERE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE COMPLAINT.   THE MODEL IS DB8.524TA. *TR",
