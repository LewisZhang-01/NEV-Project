THEY ALSO TESTED THE \"REPLACED\" PART AND DETERMINED THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. IN THAT ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC'S PROFESSIONAL OPINION, HURSH NEVER BOTHERED TO TEST THE FUEL PUMP TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS DEFECTIVE. THEY JUST GOT LUCKY WHEN THEY PUT THE WIRING HARNESS TOGETHER AND IT WORKED WHEN THEY GAVE IT BACK TO ME. WHEN I DROVE IT HOME, IT FAILED AGAIN.  - I WANT MY $700+ BILL FOR THEIR REPAIR REFUNDED. I ALSO WANT GM TO ADDRESS A POOR DESIGN OF A FUEL PUMP PLACEMENT (THAT I BELIEVE THEY STILL USE)  THAT REQUIRES $400 OF LABOR TO DROP THE FUEL TANK TO ACCESS. THERE'S NO REASON THIS PART COULDN'T BE DESIGNED TO HAVE ACCESS FROM THE SIDE OF THE TANK RATHER THAN THE TOP. BUILT IN COMPLEXITY TO STEAL MONEY FROM THE CONSUMER.*AK",
