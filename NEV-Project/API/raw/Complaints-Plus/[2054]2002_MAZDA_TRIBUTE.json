AFTER TURNING,  I WAS ONLY DRIVING THE 5 MILE AN HOUR SPEED LIMIT THROUGH THIS PARK, WHEN SUDDENLY THE DRIVER'S AIRBAG EXPLODED IN MY FACE WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHATSOEVER .  THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD HAVE EVEN SLIGHTLY INDICATED A COLLISION -- NOT A SPEED BUMP, NOT A BIRD OR ANIMAL, OR ANYTHING.  IT WAS JUST A SMOOTH, SLOW DRIVE AT 5 MILES AN HOUR ON A SUNNY DAY.  THERE WAS 60% HUMIDITY FROM PRIOR DAYS RAIN.  I HAD MY ARM UP TO MY FACE ALREADY WHEN IT HAPPENED, WHICH TOOK THE BRUNT OF THE HIT TO MY WRIST AND FOREARM.  WITHIN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG EXPLODED ALSO.  BOTH RANG OUT A SHOT LIKE A PISTOL IN THE CLOSED WINDOW CAR.  SMOKE AND BURNING SMELL STARTED FILLING THE CAR, AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP SINCE ONLY GOING 5 MILES AN HOUR, AND GET MYSELF OUT OF THE CAR QUICKLY.  MY ARM SUSTAINED HUGE WELTS FROM THE IMPACT AND WRIST FELT EXTREMELY HURT AND BRUISED AND BECAME VERY STIFF  AND HARD TO BEND.  THIS WAS ALL WITNESSED BY AN RV CAMPER AT THE KOA PARK WHO WAS SITTING 15 FEET AWAY AND WAS STARTLED BY THE PISTOL FIRE SOUND OF THE EXPLODING BAGS.  HE CAME OVER TO HELP, WHILE I LET THE SMOKE AIR OUT OF THE CAR.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE EXPLOSION DESTROYED THE CENTER OF THE STEERING WHEEL, AND A LARGE CHUNK OF 3\"X5\" PLASTIC HAD BEEN TORN LOSE AND PROPELLED DURING THE EXPLOSION.  I'M NOT SURE IF THAT IS WHAT PUT THE WELTS ON MY ARM OR THE BAG ITSELF IT HAPPENED SO SUDDENLY.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC 3 MILES AWAY, DAN'S AUTO SERVICE OF PORT ISABEL, TEXAS, TO HAVE HIM INSPECT WHAT HAPPENED.

ANYWAY, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THE FOLLOWING DAY OF THE INCIDENT AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED. FIRST, THE GUY ASKED ME IF THE VEHICLE WAS IN CRUISE CONTROL WHEN IT HAPPENED AND I TOLD HIM \"NO\". THE HE TOLD ME THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE TO BE IN CRUISE CONTROL IN ORDER FOR IT TO DO THAT BUT MY RECALL LETTER STATED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE IN CRUISE CONTROL FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE DAY AFTER I SPOKE TO THE GUY OVER THE PHONE. MY VEHICLE STAYED AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. WHEN I WENT TO GET MY VEHICLE, THE GUY IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THE RECALL HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT THE THROTTLE CABLE WAS WORN AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. ANYWAY, MY COMPLAINT WITH THIS IS, THAT PRIOR TO THE RECALL BEING DONE, I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN. SO IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE THROTTLE CABLE ITSELF, I WOULD IMAGINE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE PRIOR TO THEM DOING WHATEVER THEY CLAIMED THEY DID.   *TR",

THIS HAS BECOME VERY DANGEROUS AS IT IS HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY.  I HAD MY SON LOOK AT THE BRAKES TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T THE PADS AND HE FOUND A BROKEN TOOTH ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT ABS RING WHICH IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE WEB TO FIND IF THERE ARE ANY RECALLS AND FOUND NO RECALLS FOR THIS TROUBLE BUT I DID FIND OTHERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE CAR SERVICED AT AN APPROXIMATE COST OF $800.00.  I FEEL THAT THIS MUST BE A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO.  A CAR WITH 47,475 MILES SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.

I HAVE REPLACED THE ROTORS AND HAD OTHER SIMILIAR ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICAL THAT SEEM TO BE VERY COMMON PROBLEMS.      I HAVE SPENT THE LAST 4 HOURS DOING MY RESEARCH AND SEE THAT THERE ARE COMPLAINTS OF THIS SAME NATURE ON ALMOST EVERY WEB SITE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE AVERAGE PERSON WILL WAIT ON AN 'ISSUE' TO BECOME A RECALL.  I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO UNROLL THE WINDOW EVERY TIME I WANT TO EXIT THE VEHICLE.  NOT TO MENTION HAVING TO ASK MY PASSENGER TO LET THEMSELVES OUT IN THE SAME MANNER.  I AM NOT GOING TO PAY ANOTHER PENNY ON FIXING THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE PAID FOR SO MANY MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT NOW THAT I THINK MAZDA SHOULD HAVE FIXED.      WHEN DO THESE COMPLAINTS BECOME RECALL REALITY?      WHAT IS MY NEXT OPTION?      I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW BAD IT WOULD BE TO HAVE MY FAMILY IN THE CAR, THE ENGINE FOULS OUT BECAUSE OF THE SPARK PLUG ISSUE, THE BRAKES WON'T WORK BECAUSE OF THE MASTER CYLINDER LEAK, THE BATTERY CABLES CORRODED AND PREVENTING THE WINDOWS BEING ABLE TO LET DOWN TO OUT.

THE DEALER OPENED HER AN \"OPEN TICKET\" FOR HER NEW CAR IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS DOWN THE ROAD. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MADZA FAILED TO ASSIST ME IN ANY WAY WHEN I WAS UNDER WARRANTY. IT HAS COST ME TIME AND FRUSTRATION TO EVEN DEAL WITH MADZA AND THEIR STAFF. I AM SEEKING LEGAL ADVISE IN THIS MATTER.

I AM REPORTING THAT MY 2002 TRIBUTE'S ABS MODULE ALSO CAUGHT FIRE!  *NM    MY 2002 MAZDA TRIBUTE STARTED HAVING ABS PROBLEMS AROUND APRIL OF 2004.  THE ABS WARNING LIGHT WOULD ACTIVATE INTERMITENTLY, SOMETIMES STAYING ON FOR SEVERAL DRIVING CYCLES BEFORE CLEARING.  SOME TIME THEREAFTER, THE MOTOR ON TOP OF THE ABS ASSEMBLY WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY START RUNNING WITH THE ENGINE OFF, KEY REMOVED, PARKED IN THE GARAGE!  I DISCOVERED THIS MOTOR RUNNING BECAUSE OF THE NOISE UNDER THE HOOD.  ON TWO OCCASIONS, I WAS ABLE TO RESET IT TO A NORMAL CONDITION BY DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY FOR A PERIOD.  THE THIRD TIME THE MOTOR WAS RUNNING, IT WOULD NOT RESET FOLLOWING A BATTERY DISCONNECTION, BUT WOULD RESUME RUNNING WITH RESTORATION OF POWER.  THIS WAS IN FEBRUARY 2005, AT WHICH TIME I DISCONNECTED THE ABS MOTOR'S ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FROM THE CONTROL MODULE UNDERNEATH IT.  THEREAFTER, THE ABS WARNING LIGHT WAS ALWAYS ON (AS WOULD BE EXPECTED.)    IN MARCH 2005, WITH ABOUT 50,000 MILES SHOWING,  MY MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE ABS MODULE AS BAD, BUT I CHOSE NOT TO REPLACE IT IMMEDIATELY DUE TO THE VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR ESTIMATE.  IN JULY 2005, THIS MODULE SPONTANEOUSLY CAUGHT FIRE WHILE PARKED IN MY GARAGE, FILLING THE SPACE WITH SMOKE.  UPON DISCOVERY OF THE SMOKE, MY WIFE CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FEAR THE HOUSE WAS ON FIRE.    THE MAZDA DEALER REFUSED TO WORK ON THE CAR DUE TO THE FIRE DAMAGE, AND DIRECTED ME TO AN AUTO ELECTRIC SHOP.  THE SHOP EVENTUALLY REPAIRED THE WIRE HARNESS AND REPLACED THE MODULE WITH A NEW UNIT THAT I PURCHASED FROM THE DEALER.  IT HAS SINCE FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.

I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT ON JULY 5TH, THEY TESTED THE CAR AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION WAS GONE AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.

I WAS QUITE UPSET WITH THIS NEWS AND AS A \"GOOD WILL GESTURE\"  MAZDA OFFERED TO PAY FOR HALF OF THE TRANSMISSION, STILL  LEAVING ME WITH A BALANCE OF $2,100.00,.

I ASSUME WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT EITHER THE FORCE OF SOMEONE SITTING DOWN IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, OR IF A PASSENGER IN THE BACK SEAT KICKS THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, WHILE GETTING IN OR SITTING, IT WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE THE WIRE COME OFF OF THE SEAT RESULTING IN THE AIRBAG ERROR. I AM ABLE TO & HAVE PUT THE WIRE BACK UP UNDER THE SEAT APPROX. 4 TIMES MYSELF, BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS? A WEEK AGO, I WAS CLEANING THE INTERIOR LISTENING TO A CD WITH THE MOTOR OFF. WHEN I PULLED DOWN THE FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW, THE MUSIC STARTED GOING ON AND OFF (LOSING POWER). IF I ROLLED THE WINDOW UP IT WAS FINE, AS SOON AS IT WAS PARTIALLY DOWN, IT INTERMITTENTLY LOST POWER AGAIN. THE TRIB ENDED UP LOSING ALL POWER & UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T HAVE A BATTERY TESTER TO TEST THE BATTERY. I DECIDED TO PUT A BATTERY CHARGER ON IT, AND AFTER 10 MINUTES I TRIED TO START IT AND IT TURNED OVER. I WISH I DID HAVE SOMETHING TO TEST THE BATTERY TO SEE IF IT WAS THE BATTERY OR A SHORT. I HAVE NO CLUE IF THIS IS RELATED TO THE AIRBAG LIGHT, BUT IT HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME. I AM GUESSING THAT THERE IS PERHAPS AN ELECTRICAL SHORT, SINCE IT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE TO ME WHY THE AIRBAG LIGHT WOULD GO OFF BY THE WIRE COMING OFF OF THE SEAT TO BEGIN WITH.

THE ENGINE NOISE GOT LOUDER SO WE HAD TO STOP AT THE NEAREST EXIT AND LUCKILY THERE WAS A GAS STATION AT THE CORNER. MY HUSBAND CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE COMING FROM THE ENGINE. HE RECHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS FINE. WE CALLED MAZDA AND THEY TOWED THE VEHICLE AT THE NEAREST MAZDA DEALERSHIP. THE FOLLOWING DAY, A PERSON FROM MAZDA CALLED MY HUSBAND AND SAID WE HAD ENGINE PROBLEMS. MAZDA WANTED OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS FROM US. WE TOLD THEM THAT WE ARE NOT FROM THE AREA AND WE WERE ON VACATION AND HAVE TO GO BACK HOME AND LOOK FOR RECEIPTS. THE PERSON FROM MAZDA STATED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT MAINTAINED THEREFORE, MAZDA WILL NOT COVER THE WARRANTY. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE ENGINE WAS A QUART LOW ON OIL AND THE OIL WAS BLACK. MY HUSBAND CHECKED THE OIL AT A GAS STATION BEFORE WE WENT UP THE GRAPE VINE. HE CHECKED IT AGAIN TWICE WHEN WE PULLED OVER EACH TIME AND IT WAS FINE AND THE COLOR OF THE OIL WAS BROWN NOT BLACK. WE BOUGHT THE CAR NEW AND CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 5000 MILES. THE CAR HAS ABOUT 35,700 MILES AND THE ENGINE SHOULD NOT BREAK DOWN LIKE THAT. WE HAD NO TYPE OF WARNING AND THE ENGINE OIL LIGHT SHOULD GO ON IF THE OIL WAS LOW AND IT DID NOT GO ON BECAUSE THE OIL WAS NOT LOW. WHEN WE RETURNED HOME FROM OUR VACATION, I FAXED THE RECEIPTS TO MAZDA AND MAZDA DECLINED THE REPAIRS. THE CAR HAS BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE AND MAZDA CLAIMS THAT IT WAS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. AFTER THIS REPAIR, THE ALARM WOULD SOUND WHILE DRIVING. IT HAS STALLED ON MY HUSBAND WHILE GOING DOWN A HILL AT ABOUT 35 MPH BUT LUCKILY, HE WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND RESTART THE CAR AND STOP THE VEHICLE.

THERE WERE TRAFFIC COMING FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS (DOWN HILLS AND UP HILLS) AND IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS!  APPARENTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF CASES AS SUCH IN THE LAST YEAR.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOMEONE GET HURT.  IF THIS HAPPENED AT THE INTERSECTION BY MY HOUSE, I COULD BE DEAD!  PLEASE PASS ON ANY INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM TO ALL TRIBUTE/ESCAPE OWNERS.  THANKS.  *AK",

I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER APPLYING ALL MY WEIGHT TO THE BRAKES AND STEERING WHEEL. I MISSED AN ONCOMING CAR AND A TREE BY LUCK.  I TOOK THE TRIBUTE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THIS WAS AN ONGOING PROBLEM.  THEY WERE GOING TO PUT ME BACK IN THE TRIBUTE UNTIL MONDAY WHEN THEY HAD AN OPENING.  I REQUESTED A RENTAL CAR BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR UNTILL THE PROBLEM  WAS RESOLVED. THE MANAGER ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE TRIBUTES THAT HAVE BEEN REPAIRED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT PORBLEMS.  I RETURNED HOME AND CALLED THE MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM.  THEY ASSURED ME THAT THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT AND GET BACK WITH ME, THIS NEVER HAPPENED.  ON NOVEMBER 6TH I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP THAT MY CAR WAS READY. I ASKED TO SPEAK  WITH THE SEVICE MANAGER WHO INFORMED ME THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND I COULD PICK UP MY CAR.  I TOLD HIM I WOULD NOT PICK UP THE CAR UNTIL THERE WAS A SOLUTION TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. HE INFOMED ME THAT HIS HANDS WERE TIED AND TO CONTACT MAZDA. I CONTACTED MAZDA AND THEY CONTACTED THE SEVICE MANAGER WHO HAD ALREADY CONTACTED THE REGIONAL MANAGER.  I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CONTACTED BY HIM TOMORROW NOVEMBER 7TH.  I HAVE A 15 YEAR OLD SON WHO HAS HIS LEARNERS PERMIT AND WHO I STRONGLY BELIEVE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENT.  THE CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP.  MY TRIBUTE IS THE FIRST 2002 THAT THEY HAVE SEEN WITH THE PROBLEM.  OBVIOUSLY THIS SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEMS CONTINUES.*AK",
