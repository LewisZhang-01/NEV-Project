OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING RANDOM FAILURE IN THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, THEY ENGAGE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO REASON TO.

SINCE THE PROBLEM IS RANDOM, YOU CANNOT BE PREPARED WHEN YOU DON'T QUITE STOP AS FAST AS EXPECTED. MY TRUCK IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND I CANNOT EXPECT MY SON TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION AS HE IS AN IN-EXPERIENCED DRIVER. I WAS GOING TO SCHEDULE SOON TO HAVE IT FIXED WHEN I VIEWED THE ARTICLE ABOUT A POTENTIAL RECALL. I AM AWAITING TO HEAR YOUR DECISION AND HOPING YOU INCLUDE EARLIER MODELS (1997) SUCH AS MINE IF THERE IS A RECALL.\"    I CONCUR WITH THE ABOVE STATEMENT ENTIRELY.

UPON DIAGNOSIS BY THE MECHANICS, THEY DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED A LEAK, WHICH CAUSED FUEL PRESSURE TO BUILD-UP WHERE THE WIRING-HARNESS ENTERED THE UNIT.  THEN, FUEL WAS FORCED AT HIGH PRESSURE BETWEEN THE WIRES AND INSULATION UNTIL IT POOLED UP INSIDE THE VCM. THE DEALER'S MECHANIC, PER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, STATED THAT THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW VCM, WIRING HARNESS, AND INJECTOR SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I CONSULTED WITH A DIFFERENT GM MECHANIC FROM ANOTHER DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HE SAID I WAS LUCKY IT DID NOT EXPLODE, AND RECOMMENDED THAT I CONTACT GM OWNERS ASSISTANCE ABOUT THIS MATTER, HOWEVER THEY WERE OF NO HELP AND WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE DANGER OF THIS SITUATION.  THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A DAMAGING ENGINE FIRE AND POSSIBLE INJURY OR WORSE.

I HAVE BEEN VIEWING THE COMPLAINTS LOCATED ON YOUR WEBSITE AND FEEL THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PUPOSE FOR RECALLING THESE VEHICLES.  I PURCHASED A 1997 CHEVY K20 APPROX 1 1/2 YEARS AGO.  EVERYTHING SEEMED TO WORK FINE UNTIL A FEW MONTHS LATER.  I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE SOME STEERING PROBLEMS.  IT DOES NOT MATTER IF I AM DRIVING AROUND A CORNER OR STRAIGHT BUT THE STEERING WILL BECOME VERY LOOSE AND VEER INTO ONE DIRECTION ALL ON ITS OWN.  THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH OWNING THIS VEHICLE.  I NOW HAVE COME TO FIND THAT THERE IS EVEN A GREATER THREAT TO MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY BECAUSE I HAVE NOW BEEN INFORMED THAT MY FUEL GAUGE AND FUEL PUMP WIRES, INSIDE THE GAS TANK, MELTED INSULATION AND BURNT THE CONNECTOR.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DEADLY EXPERIENCE FOR MYSELF AND THAT OF ANYONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE VEHICLE WITH ME IF IT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE PRIOR TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INFORMATION.  I FEEL THAT THE FIRST SIGN OF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT THE GAS GAUGE WILL START TO MALFUNCTION, WHICH LEAVES YOU GUESSING AT THE AMOUNT OF GAS IN THE TANK.  I FEEL THIS MATTER NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT OWNERS/DRIVERS OF VEHICLES ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY AUTO INSURANCE, HOWEVER, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US HAS ANY CONTROLL OVER.  IF WE WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE BECOMES INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, THAT WOULD SEEM SENSELESS THAT POSSIBLY SOMEONES LIFE WOULD HAVE TO END BEFORE THIS SITUATION BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  I HAVE TO DEMAND THAT SOME ACTION BE TAKEN BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE FOR SOMEONE. *AK",

THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN REALLY HARD TO FIX BECAUSE IT COMES AND GOES AND IT DOES SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS. THE FIRST PROBLEM STARTED ABOUT 1 1/2 TO 2 YEARS AGO AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE TO PROBLEM YET. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU GO INTO A TURN TO THE LEFT, YOU CAN ACTUALLY LET GO OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE WHEEL WILL NOT RETURN TO CENTER. THE TRUCK WILL ACTUALLY GO AROUND THE TURN BY ITSELF IF YOU LET GO OF THE WHEEL. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU GO INTO A TURN IT FEELS LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL HAS BEEN PULLED BY SOMETHING. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE ONE THAT HAS ME CONCERNED BECAUSE AT TIMES IT WILL OVER STEER WITHOUT YOU ACTUALLY TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS WITH THE SAME YEAR MODEL AND MAKE OF TRUCK AND ALL THREE TRUCKS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ACCIDENT AT THIS TIME AND I HAVE TALKED WITH GM ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH NO HELP FROM THEM WHAT'S SO EVER. I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM OTHER THAN A ACCIDENT, POSSIBLY WITH A FATALITY. REALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS FOR SOMEONE TO JUST HELP WITH FINDING A FIX WITHOUT CHANGING OUT PART AND HOPING FOR A FIX WITH NO TELLING HOW MANY $$$$ LATER. AT THIS TIME I HAVE CHANGED MY STEERING BOX AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP WITHOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM. I DID CHANGE THESE OUT FROM A WRECKED TRUCK HOPING TO FIND THE PROBLEM BEFORE GOING AND BUYING A NEW PART THAT I COULD NOT RETURN.

BECAUSE IT IS RELATED TO BRAKES, I BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK TO CONSUMERS AND GM SHOULD RECALL THE DEFECT.  THIS HAPPENS EVERYDAY AND IS VERY NOTICEABLE.
