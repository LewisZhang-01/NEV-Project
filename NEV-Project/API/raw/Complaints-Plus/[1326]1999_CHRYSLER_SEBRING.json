IT HAD BEEN APPROXIMATELY 5-10 MINUTES AND CAR RESTARTED.  I GOT THE CAR HOME AND PARKED IT.  I WILL BE HAVING THE CAR TOWED TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT.  I HAVE LOOKED UP INFORMATION REGARDING THIS MECHANICAL FAILURE AND HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN 1996-1999 SEBRINGS.  MOST OWNERS HAVE PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THE PROBLEM CORRECTED.  SOME OWNERS NEVER COULD GET THE PROBLEM CORRECTED.  FROM THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE GATHERED, IT APPEARS THE PROBLEM IS THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR OR THE EGC SENSOR.  I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL ITEM AS THE VEHICLE DIES WHILE DRIVING.
