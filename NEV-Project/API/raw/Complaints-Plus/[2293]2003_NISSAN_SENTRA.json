THIS PART LOOKS LIKE IT IS PROBLEMATIC IN THIS MODEL YEAR AND MAKE AND ALSO FOR OTHER CARS ACROSS THE NISSAN LINEUP.  I EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT RESULTED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES.  EACH TIME I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OFF THE  SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT IF IT STALLED AND I WASN'T ABLE TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY, OR IT STALLED AT AN INTERSECTION OR PULLING INTO TRAFFIC SAY THE CONSEQUENCES COULD HAVE BEEN DEADLY.  I WAS ALSO LUCKY THAT THE STEERING WHEEL DIDN'T LOCK UP TURNING THE WHEEL WITH THE CAR OFF.  OUR SYMPTOMS WITH THIS CAR WERE CLASSIC.  I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM IN APRIL AS THE SYMPTOMS MATCH THEY HAVE FOR KNOWN RECALLS ON THIS AND OTHER CARS.  I WOULD LIKE IT COVERED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO OTHER VEHICLES AND VINS TO SAVE LIVES.   *TR",

I CALLED STADIUM NISSAN IN CALGARY, ALBERTA CANADA. I SPOKE TO DARREN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THERE AND WAS ADVISED THAT BECAUSE MY 60,000 KM WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT THAT IT WOULD COST ME APPROX $ 230.00. HE ALSO TOLD ME TO SIT THE CAR IN THE SUN AND THE RUBBER WOULD SOFTEN AND REFORM WITH THE WINDOWS. HE DID ADVISE ME THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN A LOT BUT HE HAS SEEN IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. HE TOLD ME THAT EVEN FIXING IT WOULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I TOLD HIM THAT THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

THE PASSENGER SIDE HIT THE MEDIAN AND DEFLATED BOTH THE FRONT AND REAR TIRERS.  THE CAR NEVER STALLED.  I WAS ABLE TO WOBBLE OVER TO THE RIGHT LANE AND EXIT THE HIGHWAY ON TO A DIRT ROAD WHICH WAS THE ENTRANCE TO A COOK COUNTY FOREST PRESERVE. I RAN INTO A STEEL GATE WHICH WAS ACROSS TTHE ROAD AS THE FOREST PRESERVE WAS CLOSED.  I SUSPECT BECAUSE TWO OF MY TIRES WERE DEFLATED, MY BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING.  2) ACTUALLY, I WAS TAKING MY CAR TO WOODFIELD NISSAN FOR SERVICE WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  WHEN I TRIED TO TURN ON THE AIR-CONDITIONING, THE KNOB (WHICH GOES FROM BLUE--COOL-- TO RED--HEAT--WAS NOT WORKING.  USUALLY THE KNOB SUCH TURNS SMOOTHLY, BUT THIS TIME, THERE WAS A GRATING SENSATION AND THE COOLING SYSTEM DID NOT TURN ON. THE HEAT COULD NOT BE TURNED OFF AND THE COOLING SYSTEM COULD NOT BE TURNED ON.   WHETHER THIS PROBLEM CAUSED THE OTHER EVENT IS HARD TO SAY, BUT I FAVOR A \"CAUSE AND EVENT\" EXPLANATION.  3)  THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO MY CAR.

I HAVE ASKED JOHN AT THE BODY SHOP TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAS THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOOK AT MY ORIGINAL AIR-CONDITIONING PROBLEM, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE BODY SHOP IS FINISHED WITH THE CAR.
