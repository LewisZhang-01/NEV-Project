FOR THE FIRST 4 OR 5 BACKUPS THE REVERSE CAMERA DISPLAY WORKED PROPERLY.  THAT IS IT CAME ON WHEN I SHIFTED INTO REVERSE AND WENT OFF WHEN I SHIFTED FORWARD.  THEN SUDDENLY IT STAYED ON FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  WE COULD NEITHER GET IT TO GO TO THE NORMAL ICON DISPLAY NOR TURN IT OFF.  IT WOULD NOT REBOOT WHEN THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF.  SAFETY CONSEQUENCE--AT NIGHT THE DISPLAY IS SO BRIGHT THAT IT COMPLETELY BLOCKS RIGHT FRONT QUARTER VISION.  I HAD TO DRIVE THIS TO 4,000 FEET AT NIGHT ON A CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE.  WE MITIGATED THE PROBLEM BY FOLDING ONE OF THE VERY LARGE AAA CITY SERIES MAPS WITH ALL ITS WEIGHT WEDGED AGAINST THE BASE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND ONE THICKNESS OVER THE DISPLAY.  THIS WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IF I HAD HAD TO RUN THE DEFROSTER.  NHTSA NEEDS TO MANDATE EITHER A PULL DOWN COVER FOR THESE DLSPLAYS OR A PANIC BUTTON TO SHUT THEM OFF.  THANK YOU.",
