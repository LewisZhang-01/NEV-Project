I took to two different dealership and they said the grooves should wear and it may take sometime. I am at 3000 miles and still the same noise. Other brakes function properly. Also, now the weather dropping to 20 F the same front brakes makes a loud grinding / gurgling noise and goes away after warmed up. No TSB, no recalls and no solution. Dealer will not change the brake pads / rotor to see if that fixes the issue.",
