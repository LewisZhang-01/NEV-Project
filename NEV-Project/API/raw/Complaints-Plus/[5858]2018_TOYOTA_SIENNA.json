Local Toyota dealership says this initially was caused by a driver of the vehicle hitting a concrete curb. Note: Bottom of the bumper is only 8 inches from ground surface. The safety issue is: the bumper and its supporting plastic frame will eventually break and fall off vehicle while in transport. I have witnessed this several times on other vehicles (especially on Toyota's).  Dealer compounds problem by saying entire bumper has to be replaced at high cost to customer. Customer delays repair (as I have). This causes further damage to the supporting plastic frame. I have gone from one snap to several snaps in duration.

ALL FOUR SEAT LATCHES ROTATE WHEN LIFTING ON THE SEAT BY HAND, ALLOWING THE SEAT TO TWIST, MOVE TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND MOVE LATERALLY.  THIS WOULD BE LESS OF A CONCERN IF THE SEATS THEMSELVES WERE NOT THE MOUNT FOR THE LATCH SYSTEM AND SEAT BELTS.  MY QUESTION IS, WHAT MOVEMENT IS ALLOWED OF THESE SEATS?    IN AN ACCIDENT, A HUGE AMOUNT OF FORCE CAN BE EXERTED ON THESE LATCHES, AND IF THEY ALLOW PLAY, THAT FORCE CAN BE MULTIPLIED BY THAT MOVEMENT.  THE INCREASE IN FORCE COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE LATCHES TO FAIL.  CURRENTLY THERE IS NO SAFETY TEST FOR THIRD ROW OCCUPANTS OR REAR END COLLISIONS, FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED.
