AFTER PICKING UP THE CAR AND GETTING ALL OF THE INFORMATION FROM MY MECHANIC THAT DAY I WENT HOME AND CALLED BMW OF NORTH AMERICA.  I GAVE THEM THE RECALL # 99E-A01AND MY VIN #.  I WAS INFORMED BY NORTH AMERICA BMW THAT THE RECALL INFORMATION IS CORRECT AND ACCORDING TO THEIR RECORDS MY CAR WAS FIXED BY TULLEY BMW 5/2002.  AFTER RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION I CALLED TULLEY BMW  AND SPOKE WITH A \"PETER\" IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND PETER CAME BACK WITH THE SAME INFORMATION THAT HIS RECORDS INDICATE IT WAS DONE.  WHEN I TOLD HIM IT WASN'T DONE BECAUSE THE PART IN MY CAR IS THE ORIGINAL SENSOR AND EXPLAINED THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART CONNECTED DIFFERENT.  AFTER ARGUING SOME MORE HE FINALLY AGREED TO LOOK AT THE CAR ON 8/30/2005.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN ON 8/29/2005 SO IT WOULD BE THERE IN THE AM.  IMMEDIATELY THE SERVICE PERSONAL HAD A MECHANIC LOOK AT THE SENSOR.  HE CONFIRMED IT WAS IN FACT THE ORIGINAL PART.  WHEN I ASKED FOR A RENTAL CAR I WAS TOLD THAT THEY FIRST HAD TO FIND OUT WHO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR THE RECALL.  I THEN INFORMED THEM THEY WERE BECAUSE I CALLED BMW OF NORTH AMERICA SAID IT WAS ALREADY DONE THEREFORE TULLEY BMW RECEIVED THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE RECALL.   NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY GAVE ME A RENTAL CAR THAT NIGHT.  *NM UPDATED 07/19/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
