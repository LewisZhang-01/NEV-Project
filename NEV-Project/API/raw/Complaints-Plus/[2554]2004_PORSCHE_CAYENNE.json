        "summary": "I returned after being away for a few weeks, in May 2021. The solar panel had been on the inner windshield of the car following installation a few months prior. I found the car's 12V battery was almost dead (about 4 Volts), and the solar panel's plastic frame was severely melted, causing it to deform and lift away from the glass solar panel. Photos uploaded below.  From reading reviews on this product on the Harbor Freight website, I now see that this is a common problem. I don't know what the cause is. Could be that the cheap plastic is just not made to withstand summer heat (although I have 2 more of these in my other cars, with no problems), and that the severe deformation of the frame somehow shorted something electical inside the panel that caused the car's 12V battery to discharge, heating the glass panel and melting all the surrounding plastic. Or it could be that an electrical problem was the trigger, causing the battery to discharge, etc.  Harbor Freight is so far making it extremely difficult to try to raise the problem with them.  I think this could be a serious issue, perhaps leading to a car fire. And if it is indeed an electrical fault that triggers this, then it could happen when parked in a garage (no solar heating needed), possibly leading to worse.",

IT WAS THE RESULT OF A WORN AND DAMAGED DAMPENER OR DIAPHRAGM LOCATED ON THE CENTER SUPPORT BEARING.

I CHECKED THE COOLANT LEVEL AND FOUND IT TO BE SEVERELY LOW. THE PORSCHE DEALER SERVICE (AND ON-LINE FORUMS) REPORT THAT PORSCHE CAYENNE ENGINES ARE ENCOUNTERING A COOLANT LEAK PROBLEM THAT APPEARS TO AFFECT ALL CAYENNE S, CAYENNE TURBO AND CAYENNE TURBO S ENGINES BUILT FROM 2003 TO 2006 (MY VEHICLE IS A 2004 MODEL).  THE COOLANT LEAK PROBLEM IS LOCATED IN THE PLASTIC COOLANT PIPES LOCATED UNDER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD OF THE ENGINE. ACCORDING TO THE PORSCHE DEALER, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM DUE TO THE PLASTIC MATERIAL USED BY PORSCHE (WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CHANGED TO A METAL MATERIAL) AND THE PLASTIC FITTINGS. THE LACK OF COOLANT CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO OVERHEAT, OR EVEN BLOW AN ENGINE, WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF THIS OCCURS WHILE DRIVING. IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, PORSCHE SERVICE SAYS THAT THE COOLANT PIPES MUST BE REPLACED, WHICH IS A VERY LABOR AND PARTS INTENSIVE SERVICE COSTING WELL OVER $1,000.  *TR",

THE REPAIR TO THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED IN JUST A FEW DAYS HOWEVER, WHEN I QUESTIONED WHY THERE WERE NO SENSORS GIVING ME A WARNING, I WAS TOLD THAT NO SENSORS EXIST.  WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER TO CONTACT PORSCHE CORPORATE TO PRESENT THIS PROBLEM, I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  SHORTLY AFTER THAT I EMAILED TO PORSCHE CORPORATE HOWEVER, NO ONE BOTHER TO REPLY.  DURING THAT TIME I CALLED THEIR PORSCHE SURVEY CENTER BECAUSE OF A POST CARD I RECEIVED REGARDING THE QUALITY OF SERVICE, AGAIN NO ONE REPLIED TO ME.
