THIS CONDITION SEEMS TO BE ONLY WHEN DRIVING REALLY SLOW, OR JUST STARTING.  THERE WERE NO INDICATOR LIGHTS (BRAKE LIGHT).  I CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID AND ALL OTHER FLUIDS, WHICH WERE AT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND BACK ON TO SEE IF IT WAS THE COMPUTER OR ABS SYSTEM, THIS DID NOT HELP.  I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC (INDEPENDENT) AND HE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS THE VACUUM PUMP THAT HAD AN OIL LEAK. THIS PUSHED THE OIL UP THE VACUUM LINE AND INTO THE BREAK BOOSTER. SO I NEED TO REPLACE THE VACUUM PUMP, VACUUM LINE, AND BRAKE BOOSTER.  HE AND I DID A CHECK AND FOUND A RECALL ON THE SAME ENGINE IN DIFFERENT BMW MODELS IN THAT YEAR AND AFTER 2007 IN THE SAME MODEL.

AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THE ERROR MESSAGE WAS A COMMON FAULT ON THESE TYPE OF CARS DUE TO A FAULTY MAT SENSOR LOCATED UNDER THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR SOME BMW CARS OF THE SAME MODEL (DEPENDENT OF VIN). MY HUSBAND IMMEDIATELY CALLED BMW OF FREMONT (NORTHERN CA) TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE RECALL AND I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF SUCH RECALL.     I USE THIS CAR DAILY TO DROP OFF OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL. I HONESTLY THINK THE ISSUE REALLY POSES A SERIOUS THREAT ON MY KIDS SAFETY SINCE THERE IS A HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT THE AIR BAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.

MY CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH BMW'S \"ACTIVE STEERING\" SYSTEM  THAT IS DRIVEN BY THE SERPENTINE BELT.  WHEN THE BELT BROKE, I WAS NOT ABLE TO STEER MY CAR AND IT FELT LIKE THE STEERING COLUMN WAS LOCKED.  I BARELY AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE AND ENDED CRASHING ON TO THE MEDIAN.  MY KIDS WERE IN THE CAR WITH ME AT THE TIME.  IF MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR, SHE WOULD HAVE CRASHED INTO THE OTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE THE FORCED REQUIRED TO TURN THE STEERING WAS EXTREMELY HIGH.  I'VE DRIVEN CARS WITHOUT POWER STEERING BEFORE, AND THIS IS NOTHING LIKE IT.  NORMALLY CARS CAN TURN WHEN MOVING - EVEN WITH NO POWER STEERING, BUT WITH A DEFECTIVE \"ACTIVE STEERING\" SYSTEM, I WAS BARELY ABLE TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL. MY CAR HAD ONLY 52000 MILES AND IT WAS SERVICED AT THE DEALER AT 48000 MILES AND NOTHING WAS DETECTED.  THE DEALER SAID THE CASTING OF THE TENSIONER PULLEY BROKE AND THE PULLEY CAME OFF AND MADE THE BELT SNAP, THEREBY LOSING MY STEERING CONTROL.  I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY LUCKY THAT I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A MAJOR ACCIDENT AND I DO NOT WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO GET INJURED OR DIE DUE TO THIS MECHANICAL DEFECT.  THIS HAPPENED VERY SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING.    THIS CONDITION NOT ONLY CAUSES THE LOSS OF STEERING, BUT CAN ALSO LEAD TO ENGINE OVERHEATING AND BATTERY DISCHARGE SINCE THIS PULLEY ALSO DRIVES THE ALTERNATOR AND WATER PUMP. *TR",
