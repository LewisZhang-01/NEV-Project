WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS, THE TRANSMISSION DROPS TO NEUTRAL SUDDENLY AND FOR MORE SEVERAL SECONDS RESULTING IN THE RIDERS' BODIES BEING ACCELERATED FORWARD RAPIDLY--OPPOSITE THE ACCELERATING FORCES--IN AN UNSAFE MANNER THAN CAN RESULT IN NEAR EJECTION FROM THE MOTORCYCLE. ALSO, WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THE MOTORCYCLE DECELERATES RAPIDLY, WHICH CAN RESULT IN A REAR-END COLLISION, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE DRIVER WAS INTENTIONALLY ACCELERATING QUICKLY FOR A MANEUVER SUCH AS MERGING OR A LANE CHANGE INTO FASTER TRAFFIC. THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, USUALLY WHEN THE SPYDER IS COLD, I.E. WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF STARTUP.
