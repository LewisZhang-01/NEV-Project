EVEN DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY IS NO EXCEPTION.  I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THE TIRES DO OFTEN THAT I AM NOW VERY RELUCTANT TO DRIVE THE CAR. I HAVE EVEN CONTACTED BMW CUSTOMER SERVICE TO COMPLAIN BUT TO NO AVAIL. I BELIEVE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS A MISMATCH OF THE TIRE WIDTH AND SPECIFICATIONS.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AS THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ROAD SAFETY ISSUE.",
