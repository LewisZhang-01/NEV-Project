        "summary": "BRAKES ON MY 2006 HOLIDAY RAMBLER MOTORHOME WITH A WORKHORSE CHASSIS    I HAVE HAD INTERM NOTICES, BUT NO ACTUAL RECALL YET, AND 2 DAYS AGO MY BRAKES WENT COMPLETELY OUT WHILE TRAVELING ON I-87 IN NEW YORK STATE, I HAD MY WIFE AND GRAND DAUGHTER WITH ME AND LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO A SAVE STOP OFF AN EXIT, BECAUSE NO ONE WAS IN FRONT OF ME. I CALLED WORK HORSE AND THEY ARE SENDING ME TO A DEALER IN SCOTIA NY FOR A FIX THAT IS ONLY GOING TO BE UNTIL THE NEW BOSH BRAKE CALIPER ARE AVAILABLE, WHICH WONT BE UNTIL THE END OF OCTOBER. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN KNOWN BY WORK HORSE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW, AND NO REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE MADE AS OF YET. HERE I LOST MY VACATION TIME, OVER $264.00 IN AN UNREFUNDABLE DEPOSIT, NOW I HAVE  OVER A TWO WEEK WAIT  TO GET REPLACEMENT PARTS THAT ARE THE OLD ONES UNTIL NEW ONES ARE MADE.TWO DEALERS HAVE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO PUT MONEY UP FRONT TO GET THE SERVICE DONE, BECAUSE THEY FEEL OTHER DAMAGE MAY HAVE BEEN DONE. I HAD NO PROBLEMS OR BRAKE DRAG UNTIL THIS INCIDENT, I HAVE APPX 15000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE. AFTER THE VEHICLE SAT FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF THE BRAKES CAME BACK, BUT THE ABS SENSOR STAYED ON. I DROVE SAFELY HOME FOR 26 MILES AND NOW ITS PARKED, AND I AM AFRAID TO USE IT. THE DEALER WHICH IS GOING TO REPAIR IT SAID THAT THERE IS A BAG LOG, TRYING TO GET THE PARTS, EVEN AFTER MARKET. *TR",
