THE PROBLEM WAS PROGRESSIVE. THE PROBLEM OCCURRED EVERY TIME THE BRAKES WERE USED. IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW FAST VEHICLE WAS GOING OR WHAT KIND OF ROAD IT  WERE ON. OWNER LOOKED UP THE RECALLS ON VEHICLE AND FOUND IT WAS A RECALL ISSUE. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN LIKE THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN TAKEN TO DEALER, WHO TOOK IT APART. THEN THE DEALER REPORTED THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PART TO FIX THE BRAKES. OWNER  CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP OVER A DOZEN TIMES ,WHO JUST SAID THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE PARTS FROM CHRYSLER. DEALERSHIP HAS NOT PROVIDED A LOANER VEHICLE.  MANUFACTURER HAS BEEN CONTACTED, AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE PARTS TO BE MANUFACTURED. AT THIS TIME, OWNER WAS STILL TRYING TO WORK WITH THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER. THE OWNER  HAD TO DRIVE A RENTAL VEHICLE AT HIS OWN EXPENSE.  *AK",

ON MONDAY COMING BACK FROM PICKING UP MY KIDS IT HAPPENED AGAIN, MY HUSBAND TOLD ME THEN THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM JUST THE DAY BEFORE. CALLED REAGAL DODGE AND THEY SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE 9TH. THEY TOLD ME RIGHT AWAY THAT THE ABS SYSTEM HAD OTHER COMPONENTS WHICH WERE NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. I SAID TO ONLY FIXED WHATEVER WAS COVER BY THE RECALL. ON FRIDAY THE 11TH THEY CALLED AND SAID THAT THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE STILL ON BUT THE BRAKES WERE WORKING FINE. A WEEK AFTER ON THE 18TH THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN ON MY WAY HOME AFTER PICKING UP MY KIDS. THIS TIME THE BRAKES WERE REALLY HARD AND THE CAR TOOK ALMOST HALF A BLOCK TO STOP COMPLETLY. TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND THIS WAS HIS DIAGNOSIS. \"PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE A BAD ABS/MASTER CYLINDER ASSEMBLY. THIS IS A WARRANTY ITEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE DEALER. TRIED TO CONTACT REGAL DODGE WITH NO LUCK, LEFT TO MESSAGES AND SENT AN E-MAIL ASKING THEM FOR AN APPOINTMENT THEY NEVER ANSWER UNTIL I CALL THE RECALL CENTER NUMBER ON THE NOTICE, THEY AGREE TO SEE THE VAN IF I AGREE TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS IN CASE THE PROBLEM WASN'T ABS RELATED. I DIDN'T ACCEPT. IS THE DEALER RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY SOME PARTS ARE NOT COVERED? CAN I HAVE MY VAN FIXED BY MY MECHANIC AND BE REIMBURSED? WASN'T THE DEALER REQUIRED TO DO ANY RECALL JOB ON A VEHICLE BEFORE SELLING IT? I UNDERSTAND THIS RECALL WAS ISSUE ON JUNE 1996, THEY SOLD ME THE VAN ON OCTOBER 1996. PLEASE I'LL APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION. THANK YOU. *AK",

ON JULY 29, 1999 THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED AGAIN.  I HAD THE VAN TOWED TO MANASSAS DODGE IN MANASSAS VA BY HENRY'S TOWING.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVE AS WELL AS A CO-WORKER WITNESSED THAT THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM LIGHT WAS ON AND THE BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING.  MANASSAS DODGE COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM. THEY SUGESTED THAT MY \"ROTORS\" HAD CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  ONCE I RECEIVED THE VAN BACK FROM MANASSAS DODGE, MY HUSBAND INSPECTED THE ROTORS AND FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH THEM.  AGAIN ON SEPTEMBER 18, 1999, WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED, THE BREAK PEDAL WAS HARD AND HAD NO PRESSURE IN THEM.  ONCE AGAIN, THIS PROBLEM SEEMED TO HAVE CORRECTED ITSELF.  I CONTACTED THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER RECALL CENTER ON MONDAY, 9/20/99 AND ADVISED THEM OF THE PROBLEM.
