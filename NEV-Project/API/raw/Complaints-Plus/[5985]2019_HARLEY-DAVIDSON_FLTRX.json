AS A RESULT, THE PRIMARY SIDE OVERFILLED; HOWEVER, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SHOW AS BEING LOW. THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A NEW ENGINE FROM THE MANUFACTURER THAT CAME OUT IN 2017. THE DEALER (TOBACCO ROAD HARLEY-DAVIDSON, 1126 S SAUNDERS ST, RALEIGH, NC 27603, (919) 832-2261) STATED THAT THEY WANTED TO DRAIN THE FLUIDS AND TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE FOR 1,000 MILES TO CHECK THE FAILURE. THE CONTACT HAD THE FIRST SERVICE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED ON HIS OWN AND THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL WAS LOW. THE MANUFACTURER WAS EMAILED AND SUGGESTED PUTTING IN A VENT TO THE PRIMARY AREA TO REMEDY THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 650. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN.",
