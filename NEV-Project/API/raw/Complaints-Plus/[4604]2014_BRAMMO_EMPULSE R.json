WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE MOTORCYCLE LOSES ALL POWER AND HAD TO BE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND POWERED ON/OFF.    FIRST INSTANCE I WAS TRYING TO PASS A VEHICLE ON AN UPHILL GRADE, THE SECOND WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE ONTO THE FREEWAY.      AN MOTOR POWER LOSS LIKE THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ANY TIME A VEHICLE IS AT SPEED, BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY THREATENING WHEN IT OCCURS DURING A PASSING OR FREEWAY MERGING SITUATION.  IN BOTH CASES, I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, BUT GIVEN HEAVIER TRAFFIC OR AN ONCOMING CAR DURING A PASSING SITUATION AND THIS COULD BE LIFE THREATENING.",
