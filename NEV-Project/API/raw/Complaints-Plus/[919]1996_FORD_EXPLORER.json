HE END UP DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY TO TURN OFF THE EXPLORER.  THIS IS AN 1996 EDDIE BAUER EDITION. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM. IF SO HOW DID YOU FIX IT AND THE COST? PLEASE REPORT THE SITUATION TO NHTSA.  *TR",

MUCH TO MY BENEFIT, THE MATERIAL JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE FIRE RESISTANT STUFFING FROM MY ARCHERY TARGET, STORED IN THE SAME BUILDING. I STARTED MY VEHICLE AND IMMEDIATELY UPON TURNING ON THE HEATER, I HEARD A TERRIBLE NOISE WHICH ENDED ABRUPTLY. MY HEATER STOPPED WHEN THE NOISE STOPPED. IN AN EFFORT TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM I INSPECTED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. I THEN NOTICED A BURNT SMELL, BUT SAW NO SMOKE. UPON REPLACING MY BLOWER MOTOR I INSPECTED THE OLD ONE, WHICH HAS CHARRED REMNANTS OF THE FOREIGN MATERIAL INSIDE AND WRAPPED AROUND THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS. THE ONLY OPENING TO THE INNER COMPONENTS OF THE BLOWER MOTOR IS ABOUT 1\" IN DIAMETER AND HAS A RUBBER TUBE PLUGGED INTO IT. IT APPEARED UNDISTURBED AND WAS CONNECTED WHEN I FIRST SERVICED IT. I ALSO DISCOVERED AN OPENING ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE BLOWER FAN HOUSING, NEAR THE FIREWALL. THIS UNOBSTRUCTED OPENING FACILITATED THE RODENTS' ENTRY TO THE HEATING SYSTEM. IT IS OF MY OPINION THIS IS UNSAFE, AND HAD THE FOREIGN MATERIAL NOT BEEN FLAME RESISTANT, I'M CONVINCED MY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BURNED.

HER HANDS CAME OFF THE STEERING WHEEL AND SHE WAS LEFT PRONE STARING AT THE CEILING OF THE VEHICLE. THIS SHOULD BE A GREAT CONCERN TO NHTSA SINCE ANY DRIVER EXPERIENCING SUCH A FAILURE WHILE DRIVING WOULD BE IN GRAVE DANGER.  AFTER REMOVING THE SEAT AND RESEARCHING ISSUES WITH EXPLORER SEATS I FOUND THE 1998 EXPLORER RECALL THAT EXACTLY DESCRIBED OUR SEAT FAILURE. THE SAME EXACT BOLT IN THE 1998 RECALL WAS THE CAUSE OF OUR SEAT COLLAPSE. I HAVE SAID BOLT ( BROKEN IN TWO PIECES)AND WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE NHTSA EXAMINING IT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO BAD BOLTS OR IF THE SEAT DESIGN CAUSED THE BOLT TO FAIL.  I HAVE SINCE REPLACED THE BOLT WITH A NEW BOLT AND STEEL SPACER (I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE REMEDY CALLED FOR IN THE 1998 RECALL) IF I HAD NOT REMOVED THE SEAT THE WHOLE PROCESS WOULD HAVE TAKEN UNDER 20 MINUTES AND THE PARTS CAN BE HAD FOR UNDER $2 .  PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT DOESN'T YOUR WEB SEAT SAY THAT IF A SAFETY RELATED REPAIR IS NECESSARY THE MANUFACTURER WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR SAID REPAIR.

LATER THAT SAME EVENING AFTER SCHOOL LET OUT I PROCEEDED ON A TRIP. I LEFT TUCSON, AZ AROUND 5:30 TO 6:00PM GOT NO FARTHER THAN YUMA AZ WHEN THE TREAD FROM MY RIGHT REAR TIRE COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE STEEL BELT UNDERNEATH TEARING THE REAR RIGHT BUMPER OFF, THE BUMPER AREA UNDERNEATH THE DOOR WAS HANGING ON THE GROUND AND BIG BLACK CIRCULAR MARKS WERE ON THE BACK PASSENGER DOOR WHERE THE TREAD HAD HIT DURING SEPARATION. THE EVENT ITSELF WAS HORRIBLY FRIGHTENING FOR US AS WELL AS MY 3 CHILDREN. THANK THE LORD WE DID NOT WRECK AND THERE WAS NO TURNOVER OF THE VEHICLE. WE WERE ABLE TO CHANGE THE TIRE WITH A SPARE BUT THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE TO THE VEHICLE. THE TIRE WAS A FIRESTONE WILDERNESS HT P225/70R15. I WENT BACK TO THE FORD DEALER WHO HAD SAFETY CHECKED THE TIRE AND HE SAID IT WAS A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING AND HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN. THE DOT CODE ON THE TIRE IS W2UU IPO .99.  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE WHO SAID THE LAST 2 NUMBERS WOULD BE THE DATE THE TIRE WAS MANUFACTURED. MY QUESTIONS ARE IS THIS A COMMON THING FOR THESE TYPES OF TIRES AND WHAT IS THE LIFE SPAN OF THAT TIRE.

UPON INSPECTION, BOTH SIDES ARE COMPLETELY RUSTED AND THE OTHER ARM COULD SHEAR OFF AT ANY TIME.  NOWHERE ON THIS VEHICLE IS THERE RUST AND THESE WELDED BRACKETS ARE IN THE INTERIOR SEAL OF THE REAR HATCH AND ARE IN NO WAY EXPOSED TO WATER.  WE WERE ABLE TO UNHOOK THE ARM TOTALLY WITH THE LITTLE PINS HOLDING IT IN PLACE.  THEN THE HATCH WOULDN'T CLOSE PROPERLY ONCE THE ARM WAS REMOVED.  (I WAS TOLD THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION.)  I CALLED FORD (NATIONAL 800 NUMBER NOT THE LOCAL DEALER) AND ASKED THEM ABOUT IT.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WOMAN IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NO COMPLAINTS ON THAT AND THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL SO I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A BODY SHOP WHICH GAVE ME A QUOTE OF $468 TO WELD NEW BRACKETS ON (BOTH SIDES WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED TO PREVENT FUTURE INJURIES).  THE HYDRAULIC ARMS THEMSELVES WORK FINE.  UPON VIEWING YOUR SITE, I SEE THERE WAS A RECALL THE YEAR AFTER THE CAR WAS MADE DEALING WITH THE RIGHT SIDE HYDRAULIC ARM AND IMPROPER WELDING.  (RECALL # 97V137000)  I BASICALLY JUST WANT IT FIXED AND WANT THEM TO FIX ANYBODY ELSE'S SO NOBODY ELSE WILL GET HURT.  WHAT IF A MOM IS UNLOADING GROCERIES WITH HER KID AND THE DOOR COMES CRASHING DOWN ON THEM???  HOW MANY INJURIES OR DEATHS WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO FIX SOMETHING LIKE THIS??!!  *JB",

PER FORD OWNER'S MANUAL, AIRBAG & ATBS IMPACTED. I REPLACED THE FUSES TO MATCH THE OWNER'S MANUAL. TODAY, I TOOK THE CAR TO A PRIVATE SHOP, THAT WORKED ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM EARLIER. THE OWNER PULLED AN ALL DATA SCHEMA, WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT. HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ELECTRICAL SCHEMA IS CORRECT - THE  OWNER'S MANUAL,  THE OTHER SHOPS REFERRED TO, OR ALL DATA? IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, 60A VS 30A FUSES, DIFFERENT BLANK RELAYS, ETC.  IF THE FORD MANUAL IS CORRECT, AND I FOLLOW THE ALL DATA SCHEMA, IT COULD TRIGGER FIRE OR MALFUNCTION. VICE VERSA, WOULD BE BAD ALSO. EITHER WAY, CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ALERTED? EITHER TO  INCORRECT ELECTRICS IN THE FORD MANUAL, OR TO AN INCORRECT ALL DATA SCHEMA USED BY MECHANICS?  (I HAVE ASKED FORD, ALSO, FOR A REPLY.)   ALSO - THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN 6 MONTHS I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, BUT NO OTHER SYMPTOMS. THE FIRST TIME, THE MECHANIC REPLACED THE CAM SENSOR, AND IT EVENTUALLY WENT OFF. HE STATED THIS WARNING LIGHT WAS INSIGNIFICANT, AND REFERRED ONLY TO EMISSIONS STANDARDS. (NO VISIBLE EMISSIONS). I NOTE THAT - PER THE OWNERS MANUAL AGAIN - THIS WARNING LIGHT CAN ALSO BE TRIGGERED BY A MONITORING, GPS, OR ALARM DEVICE BEING INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE. IF I CAN FIND NO OTHER CAUSE, HOW WOULD I CHECK FOR THIS, AND DO YOU HAVE OTHER RECORDS OF THIS BEING THE CAUSE?   THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ALSO AN ISSUE, LAST SPRING. IN APRIL 02, THE FORD DEALER IN ORLANDO REPLACED THE IDLE AIR CONTROL, AND THE VALVE ASSEMBLY-THRO.

IT CAN HAPPEN WHEN THE REAR DOOR IS BEING OPENED AND THE FRONT DOOR IS ALREADY OPEN.  MY DAUGHTER WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE FRONT DOOR AND APPARENTLY TOUCHED THIS ROLLER MECHINISM AS MY HUSBAND WAS OPENING THE REAR DOOR, IT BASCIALLY SUCKED HER FINGER IN AND CUT IT OFF (DUE TO THE PRESSURE - THE ROLLER USES THE CAR BODY TO HOLD THE DOOR OPEN).  WE HAVE CHECKED AND SOME VEHICLES HAVE THIS AND OTHER DO NOT AND SOME HAVE IT COVERED UP!  IT WOULD ONLY BE APPLICABLE IN 4 DOOR VEHICLES. PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, AS I KNOW IT IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING.  BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO PREVENT ANYONE ELSE FROM GOING THROUGH WHAT WE DID - MY DAUGHTER (2 YEARS OLD) HAD TO HAVE EMERGENCY SURGERY TO REMOVE MORE OF THE BONE/FINGER AND REPAIR THE TIP THE BEST IT COULD BE.  SHE STILL HAS DISCOMFORT AT TIMES AND IT HAS BEEN 2 1/2 MONTHS SINCE THE ACCIDENT.  WE HAVE CHECKED IT OUT AND SHE COULD HAVE FIT HER WHOLE HAND IN THERE WHICH WOULD OF BEEN EVEN MORE TRAGIC!

FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THESE TIRES ON MY FORD EXPLORER.  WHEN WE TRAVELED AT 60MPH, THE VEHICLE WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD AND FIRESTONE DEALERS WHO TOLD US THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  SO FOR THE NEXT 2 1/2 YEARS, WE DID NOT DARE DRIVE ABOVE 60MPH.  WHILE THESE TIRES WERE ON THE EXPLORER, I MADE SURE TO HAVE THEM ROTATED AND PROPERLY INFLATED PER THE DIRECTIONS ON THE TIRES.  ABOUT TWO YEARS LATER, WE NOTICED EXTREME WEAR ON THE OUTER PERIMETERS OF ALL FOUR TIRES, AS WAS NOTICED BY THE PLACE WHERE WE GOT THE TIRES ROTATED, AS WELL AS STRANGERS AT GAS STATIONS.  I TOOK IT AGAIN TO FIRESTONE AND DEMANDED REPLACEMENT.  I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO MILEAGE WARRANTY, AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SO WORN OUT (STEEL BELTS VISIBLE) ON THE PERIMETER (BUT NOT THE MIDDLE TREAD AREA) THERE WAS NO WEAR CREDIT.  I WAS TOLD THAT ALL I COULD DO WAS PURCHASE NEW TIRES AT MY COST.  NOT WANTING TO PUT MY FAMILY'S LIFE IN JEOPARDY, IN EARLY 1999, I REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES AT MY COST ($367.29) WITH MICHELINS.  SINCE THEN, NOT ONLY IS THE CAR RUNNING SMOOTHLY ABOVE 60MPH, WITH 20,000 MILES ON THEM, THEY STILL HAVE PLENTY OF TREAD FOR ANOTHER 20-30,000 MILES.  WHEN THE RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED IN AUGUST 2000, I REJOICED BECAUSE I KNEW SOMETHING WAS INHERENTLY WRONG WITH THE TIRES, AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT (MISTAKINGLY) I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.  BUT...BECAUSE I HAD REPLACED MY TIRES BEFORE THE OFFICIAL RECALL, I AM NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. IRONICALLY, WHEN I WENT TO THE FORD DEALER RECENTLY FOR A DIFFERENT RECALL, HE NOTICED THAT I STILL HAD A WILDERNESS ATX AS A SPARE, SO I AM IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING THAT ONE. IT IS HIGHLY UNETHICAL AND INSULTING TO BE REIMBURSED FOR A NEVER-USED SPARE AND NOT FOR THE OTHER FOUR, (DOT NUMBER: VDHL 1PM 4  TIRESIZE: P235/75R15)",

THE LITTLE ARROW IN THE DASHBOARD THAT TELLS YOU WHAT GEAR YOU ARE IN.  THEY WANT $ 150.00 TO REPLACE THAT PIECE.  I FEEL THAT THE INDICATOR SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.

THE SERVICE MANAGER DROVE THE CAR AND SAID IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE DRIVING BUT HE COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY ON THE LIFT HE SAID THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH TIRE SO HE CHANGED IT.  NEXT DAY AT FIRESTONE SERVICE CENTER I WAS TOLD BY MANAGE THAT THE TIRE SEPARATED. HE REPLACED THE TIRE WITH SAME MAKE AND CHARGED ME 37.00.  IN JANUARY 2000 ANOTHER TIRE SEPARATED AND I AGAIN BOUGHT A NEW TIRE FOR 67.00.  IT ALSO SEPARATED.  I'M ADVISING OF THIS INFO TO HELP OTHERS REGARDING THE ISSUE OF TIRE INFLATION.  FIRESTONE CONTINUES TO BLAME THE CONSUMER BUT WE INFLATED OUR TIRES TO AT LEAST 30.  THERE IS AN OBVIOUS DEFECT IN THE TIRES.  ALL THIS INFO IS DOCUMENTED SHOULD SOMEONE REQUIRE IT REGARDING A SERIOUS INJURY.  I WAS VERY VERY LUCKY SO I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT AS FORTUNATE .( DOT NUMBER:   TIRE SIZE: 23575R15 )",

I WAS UNABLE TO USE THE CD PLAYER INSTALLED (BY FORD) IN THE COMPARTMENT BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS.  FORD BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON THE TIRES AND HAD ME GO TO A TIRE SHOP TO HAVE THEM REPLACED.  THIS HAPPENED IN 1997!  THE TIRE SHOP (DON OLSON TIRES) CLAIMED THERE WAS A SUSPENSION PROBLEM WITH THE FORD EXPLORERS AND IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.  THEY REPLACED THE TIRES WITH NEW FIRESTONE RADIAL ATXS.  WE REALIGNED THE VEHICLE AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO GO AWAY.  AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS, THE PROBLEM CAME BACK (NOT AS SEVERE).  I CONTINUED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE REALIGNED ABOUT EVERY 4 MONTHS.  UNFORTUNATELY, AS THE TIRES GOT OLDER, THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE.  I CONTINUED THE BALANCING OF THE TIRES AND REALIGNMENT PROCESS OFTEN.  AUGUST 15, 2000 WHILE DRIVING WITH MY FAMILY, WE HAD A TREAD SEPARATION OF THE RADIAL ATX TIRES.  THEY HAD ABOUT 35000-40000 MILES ON THEM.  THEY WERE REPLACED BY THE FIRESTONE \"FIREHAWK\" TIRES (NOT THE RECALL ONES).  I HAD THE VEHICLE REALIGNED AGAIN.  I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CENTER CONSOLE AREA SHAKING.  IT SEEMS TO BE WORSE AT ABOUT THE SAME 72-73 MILES PER HOUR.  FORD HAS NEVER CLAIMED ANY RESPONSIBILITY.  I HAVEN'T ASKED THEM FOR THEIR OPINION SINCE THE FIRST TIME I APPROACHED THEM (IN 1997), THEY BLAMED THE TIRES.  IT APPEARS TO ME AS IF IT IS A FORD EXPLORER PROBLEM AS MUCH AS A FIRESTONE TIRE PROBLEM.  PLEASE RESEARCH THIS IF POSSIBLE AND HAVE FORD REEVALUATE THEIR POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.  PLEASE ADVISE ME IF YOU NEED ANY MORE INFORMATION AS I WILL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU.  MY OFFICE PHONE NUMBER IS 305-526-1215.  THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

I HAVE TALKED TO MAGIC FORD AND THEY FEEL IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. I HAVE TALKED TO FIRESTONE AND BECAUSE I DID NOT KEEP THE FIRST 2 TIRES WITH SEPARATION THEY SAY THAT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. HAD I KNOWN A RECALL WOULD HAPPEN I WOULD HAVE KEPT THE BAD TIRES. I DID TAKE PICTURES OF THE TIRES AND DAMAGE TO CAR BUT FIRESTONE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE.  I AM NOW OUT OF POCKET  FOR 5 FIRESTONE TIRES AND FRONT END DAMAGE ON MY CAR. DO I HAVE ANY  RECOURSE?( DOT NUMBER:   TIRE SIZE: P235-75R15 )",

A LOUD 'THUMP' WAS HEARD FROM THE REAR, FOLLOWED BY A SCRAPING SOUND (PRESUMABLY AS THE TREAD CAUGHT AROUND THE WHEEL ARCH).  THE TIRE SHOWS SIGNS OF THE SHED TREAD HAVING RUBBED AGAINST THE REST OF THE TIRE AS IT CONTINUED TO REVOLVE WITH THE TREAD CAUGHT IN THE WHEEL ARCH.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK FIRESTONE WAS CONTACTED AND EXPRESSED NO CONCERN WHATSOEVER, SAYING THAT THE TIRE HAD PROBABLY HIT SOMETHING IN THE ROAD OR BEEN PREVIOUSLY CURBED, CAUSING THE TREAD SHED.  THE TIRE, AND OTHERS ON THE VEHICLE, WERE REPLACED (WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF THE SAME TIRE TYPE), AT THE DRIVER'S EXPENSE.  I WAS MOST CONCERNED WHEN I NOW LEARN OF A RECALL ON ALL SUCH TIRES AND CONTACTED FIRESTONE ON THE FREEPHONE NUMBER.  I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE 'STANDARD' REPLACEMENT ANSWER, AS I STILL HAD THIS TIRE IN MY POSSESSION.  I WAS GIVEN VARIOUS OTHER NUMBER TO CALL WITHIN THE COMPANY, BUT RECEIVED NOTHING MORE THAN THE STANDARD \"TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPLACEMENT\" ANSWER.  I FEEL THAT FIRESTONE SHOULD AT VERY LEAST HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO RECOVER THE TIRE AND ANALYZE THIS EXAMPLE FOR THEIR RECORDS.  I THEREFORE CONTACTED NHTSA FOR THEIR ADVICE AND HAVE BEEN SENT A LABEL FOR RETURN OF THE TIRE.

I WAS TRAVELING AT 60 MPH AND AS I CONTINUED TO DECREASE IN SPEED THE VIBRATION INCREASED AND BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP I FELT A LARGE BANG IN THE LEFT REAR OF THE VEHICLE AS IF THE TIRE BLEW, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SWERVE BACK AND FORTH TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL NEARLY MISSING ANOTHER VEHICLE.

DURING THE DURATION OF THE DRIVE TO TALLAHASSEE I OBSERVED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REMAINING TIRE ON THE VEHICLE.  MY CONCLUSION WHEN I ARRIVED IN TALLAHASSEE WAS THAT I DID NOT FEEL THAT THE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE WERE SAFE AND WOULD NOT BET MY FAMILIES LIFE THEM SO I HAD THEM REPLACED.  WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK I HAD FOUR OF THE FIVE TIRES REPLACED ON THE VEHICLE, THE SPARE STILL REMAINS UNDER THE VEHICLE UNTIL SUCH TIME THIS MATTER IS RESOLVED.

IT IS MY FIRST SUV AND I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY IT HANDLED ON BUMPS IN THE ROAD, OVER RAILROAD TRACKS, IN DIPS IN THE ROAD, ETC.  SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WAY IT HANDLED.  BECAUSE THE DEALER \"COULD NOT DUPLICATE\" THE PROBLEM, THEY SAID EVERYTHING WAS OK.  THEY ALSO SUGGESTED THAT BECAUSE IT IS AN SUV I SHOULD GET USED TO THE ROUGHER RIDE.  THE PROBLEM HOWEVER WAS IN THE WAY I FELT I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, NOT THAT THE RIDE WAS ROUGH.  I CONTINUED TO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WAY IT HANDLED ON SUBSEQUENT VISITS.  I EVEN BEGAN ASKING THEM TO LOOK AT THE TIRES.  I BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIRES AS I SAW DRY ROT ON THE OUTER EDGES OF EACH OF THE TIRES.  AGAIN, I BELIEVE EVERYTIME I TOOK IT IN I ASKED THEM TO EXAMINE THE TIRES AND LET ME KNOW IF I SHOULD BE CONCERNED.  THEY WOULD NOTE THE TIRE TREAD ON MY PAPERWORK BUT NO ONE EVERY COUNSELED ME.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A SERVICE STATION NEAR MY HOME TO SEE WHAT THEY THOUGHT.  I WAS TOLD TO REPLACE THE TIRES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TO TRY NOT TO DRIVE FOR MANY MILES AT A TIME AND ESPECIALLY DURING HOT DAYS.  I REPLACED THE TIRES WITHIN THE WEEK.  I AM CONCERNED NOW ABOUT THE FIRESTONE RECALL AND THAT VA IS IN PHASE THREE.  I REPLACED MY OLD FIRESTONE TIRES WITH MICHELINS AND DO NOT WISH TO HAVE A FIRESTONE PRODUCT ON ANY OF OUR CARS.

I SWERVED SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE SUV ROLLED COMPLETELY TO THE RIGHT, LANDING UPRIGHT FACING THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO ONCOMING OR TRAILING TRAFFIC, SO NO OTHER VEHICLES/PERSONS WERE INVOLVED.  I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT & WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO SUSTAIN ONLY VERY MINOR INJURIES & WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE SUV W/ SOME ASSISTANCE FROM PEOPLE WHO STOPPED TO HELP.  AS I COMPLAINED OF NECK PAIN, I WAS AMBULANCED TO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY HOSPITAL, BUT WAS RELEASED W/ ONLY MINOR BRUISES, CUTS & SORE MUSCLES.  MY INSURANCE COMPANY (20TH CENTURY) DECLARED THE VEHICLE A TOTAL LOSS (PICTURES AVAILABLE) AND PAID ME $24,072.70, PLUS COVERED MY AMBULANCE & EMERGENCY ROOM BILLS.  PRIOR TO THIS ACCIDENT I HAD ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY SUV IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  TIRE PRESSURE WAS ROUTINELY CHECKED IN CONJUNCTION W/ REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY 3000 MILES.  ALL TIRES HAD PLENTY OF REMAINING TREAD & HAD BEEN  RECENTLY   ROTATED & BALANCED.  I CONTEND THAT  THIS ACCIDENT WAS DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN OF THE FIRESTONE AT TIRES.  I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A 2000 EDDIE BAUER EXPLORER W/ THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS PLUS ANOTHER APPROXIMATE $11,000 OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.   ADDITIONALLY, I IMMEDIATELY TRADED IN THE STANDARD FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES FOR MORE TRUSTWORTHY ( & MORE EXPENSIVE) BF GOODRICH AT TIRES.  I WILL NEVER USE FIRESTONE TIRES ON ANY OF MY CARS AGAIN.  IF A CLASS ACTION SUIT SHOULD BE FILED AGAINST FIRESTONE FOR THESE NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS INVOLVING THEIR ALL TERRAIN TIRES W/ FORD EXPLORERS, I WOULD LIKE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SUIT.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TWO OR THREE TIMES FOR MINOR REPAIR WORK WHILE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. IT CURRENTLY HAS APRROX. 54,000 MILES ON IT AND I AM EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. IT IS SLIPPING IN FIRST AND SECOND GEAR, AND IS ON THE VERGE OF NEEDING TO BE REPLACED. AFTER DOING SOME CHECKING I FOUND THAT IT IS GOING TO COST ME AT LEAST $2,400.00 FOR THE REPAIRS TO THE TRANSMISSION. I NORMALLY DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF VEHICLE REPAIRS BECAUSE I DEPEND ON MY VEHICLES , FOR BOTH MYSELF AND MY FAMILY.  HOWEVER, IT IS MY CONSIDERED OPINION THAT A NEARLY NEW VEHICLE SUCH AS THIS ONE WITH THE LOW AMOUNT OF MILEAGE THAT IT HAS, SHOULD NOT BE HAVING PROBLEMS LIKE IT IS CURRENTLY HAVING WITH THE TRANSMISSION. I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE FOR THIS MATTER TO BE INVESTIGATED SO THAT I CAN DETERMINE IF I AM ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY ASSISTANCE BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY, OR TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE ADDITONAL CONSUMERS THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING AND JUST SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER. THANK YOU FOR ANY ASSISTANCE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER ME CONCERNING THIS MATTER. *AK",

VEHICLE DID NOT RESPOND AND CONTINUED TO SPIN TURNING BACKWARDS REGARDLESS OF FRANTIC TURNING OF STEERING WHEEL INTO TURN INTO THE SKID. VEHICLE CONTINUED TO TRAVEL BACKWARDS AND SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. VEHICLE SLOWED SOMEWHAT, BUT CONTINUED TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE REMAINING LANES OF THE HIGHWAY AND SHOULDER HITTING THE GUARDRAIL WITH THE LEFT REAR CORNER FIRST, THEN BOUNCING UNTIL THE RIGHT FRONT HIT THE GUARDRAIL AND FINALLY STOPPED. VEHICLE WAS NOW FACING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF TRAFFIC. ABS DASH LIGHT WAS BURNING INDICATING A FAILURE. THE IMPACT KNOCKED MOST OF THE AIR OUT OF THE LEFT FRONT TIRE WHICH CONTINUED TO HOLD AIR PERFECTLY ONCE REINFLATED. MY PASSENGER WAS SLIGHTLY HURT ON THE SCALP AND CHEEK. SEATBELTS WERE BEING WORN. THIS FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM THE DRIVER. THE REPAIRS WILL REACH ABOUT $8000.00. I HAVE REQUESTED TO THE REPAIR SHOP TO PROVIDE ME AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE ABS LIGHT IS STAYING ON AND IF IT COULD HAVE GONE ON CAUSING THE START OF THE VEHICLE ROTATION. THIS IS THE 3RD EXPLORER I HAVE OWNED AND HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE DRIVING THESE TYPE SUV'S IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER. SOMETHING HAD TO CAUSE THIS ACCIDENT OTHER THAN DRIVER ERROR.",

I HAVE SINCE THE LAST DEALER VISIT, AND SUBSEQUENT FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER CALLS, TAKEN MY TRUCK TO 3 DIFFERENT AUTO REPAIR SHOPS. 3 OF 3  SAID IT WAS DRIVE TRAIN RELATED. 2 OF 3 SAID IT WAS THE DRIVESHAFT OR ATTACHED COMPONENTRY. PATTERSON DRIVESHAFTS IN INDIANAPOLIS REBALANCED AND TRUED THE DRIVE SHAFT AND 50% OF THE VIBRATION PROBLEMS WERE IMMEDIATELY DONE AWAY WITH, (THIS WAS IN ONE DAY, FIRST VISIT). ONE FORD DEALER SERVICE SHOP ASSERTED THEY HAD REPLACED THE DRIVESHAFT ON ONE OF THE SERVICE CALLS. BUT THIS IS ONLY SOMETHING WRITTEN ON A RECEIPT TO ME, SINCE THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE CALL SEEMED TO DO LITTLE, IF ANYTHING FOR THE PROBLEM. I CALLED FORD C.S.D. TO ASK HOW THIS CAN BE THAT AN \"OUTSIDE\" SERVICE COMPANY COULD FIND THIS PROBLEM CAUSE WITH SEEMINGLY LITTLE EFFORT. I WAS TOLD BY THE FMC REP. THAT WE(FORD)DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE 'OPINION' OF OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS, RELATIVE TO REPAIRS\". (I HAVE SINCE BEEN TOLD THAT PATTERSON DRIVESHAFT IS ONE OF FORD'S MOST USED DRIVESHAFT CONTRACTOR/TECHNICIANS), THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK. THEN RECENTLY, I HEARD FROM A FRIEND ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE, (I HAD CALLED ONCE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO). THIS IS GREAT! I CAN SEE NO LESS THAN 3 TSB'S ON MY PARTICULAR ISSUE, AND SOME MORE COMPLAINTS THAT I'VE VOICED TO FORD (\"NO PROBLEM FOUND\"), I SEE ARE LISTED TOO. NOW IF I ONLY KNEW WHAT TO DO FROM HERE. I HAVE PAID FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS, AND BEEN TOLD THAT THIS MAY TAKE UPWARDS OF 16 HOURS @ $78.00 PER HOUR TO PINPOINT THE LAST OF THE VIB.

THEY DID IT WITH THE PINTOS AND NOW WITH THE EXPLORERS.  DON'T ALLOW THIS, ITS NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER.  I HAD MY THREE YEAR OLD BOY WITH ME AND I COULD HAVE LOST HIM.  *AK",

THE NATIONAL INSURANCE INSTITUTE WEB PAGE SAID THE AVERAGE SPEED SHOULD BE BETWEEN 12-16 MPH.    MY EXPLORER HAS MANY PROBLEMS (IT'S A LEMON). THIS, HOWEVER, WORRIES ME. WOULD MY AIRBAG ACTIVATE AT A HIGHER SPEED?   SHOULD I BE AFRAID TO PUT MY FAMILY INSIDE AND GO FOR A RIDE?
