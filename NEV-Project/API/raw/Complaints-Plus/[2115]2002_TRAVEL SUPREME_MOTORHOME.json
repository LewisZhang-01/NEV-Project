I PURCHASED THIS ONE IN 2014 AND HAVE BEEN TOTALLY FRUSTRATED IN MY ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION. THERE IS A LAW EITHER AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL, DIS-ALLOWING THE SALE OF AN IS SEAT (INTEGRATED SEAT BELT) TO OTHER THAN SPECIFIC MAKES AND MODELS. MINE IS NOT INCLUDED. PLEASE FOLLOW THIS IL-LOGIC: MY CURRENT SEATS WHICH MET DOT STANDARDS AT THE TIME ARE CANTILEVERED TO THE FLOOR ON A BRACKET AND THE LAP BELT IS PART OF THAT SEAT, THAT IS, THERE IS NO SUPPLEMENTAL CONNECTION FOR THE BELT. SO, WHY WOULD IT MATTER HOW MANY POINTS I WAS ATTACHED TO THE SEAT WITH? IT WOULD NOT PUT ANY MORE STRESS ON THE MOUNTING WHICH IS APPARENTLY FINE, BUT EVERY OUTLET I'VE COME ACROSS REFUSES TO SELL ME AN I/S SEAT BECAUSE OF THIS LAW OR STATUTE OR WHATEVER MIS-WRITTEN PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS BEING REFERRED TO. I AM ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE ME WITH A WAIVER SO I CAN PUT SAFER SEATS IN MY RV AND STOP FEELING NAKED AND UNPROTECTED DUE TO ONLY HAVING THE LAP BELT. I CONTACTED FLEX STEEL TODAY AND WAS TOLD, YET AGAIN, THAT THEY WILL NOT MANUFACTURE OR SELL AN I/S SEAT TO OTHER THAN SPECIFIC VEHICLE VIN'S. CAN YOU ADD MINE TO THE LIST? I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE NERVOUS DRIVING THE RV WITH ONLY A LAP BELT, AND THERE IS NO OTHER STRUCTURE, SUCH AS OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER, TO ATTACH A SHOULDER HARNESS THAT WOULD HAVE ANY STRENGTH AT ALL. PLEASE, PLEASE CONSIDER THIS APPLICATION. I WANT A NEW SEAT WITH A SHOULDER HARNESS!!!",
