Fortunately no one was coming through the door into which the car crashed.   The car was drivable despite the severe damage to the rear end. I drove it up to street level, where it was towed from to a body shop. The following week it was declared a total loss, and sent to salvage. I have not yet reported this to the manufacturer. It was only while I doing research to get a new car, that I stumbled upon the issue of subaru imprezas suddenly accelerating on their own. Now everything makes sense, although it doesn't lessen the trauma that we all experienced. I truly hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",

It worked on and off the entire ride, starting with it working and then would shut off, on the highway, while my passenger never moved from the seat. I called the dealership and they said they would look at it. They did nothing, they blamed it on the seats having been steam cleaned (that dampness messes with the sensors? as if that's a reasonable reason my airbag won't deploy?) I asked if they checked the connections and they just blanket answered that they'd need to see it with the light on, and that 'i'm sure the technician checked everything'. I'm unsure how to do that other than driving to the dealership with a passenger the next time it happened? Today I drove it, again with a passenger, and it worked only one way on the trip. I pulled over, tried to shut off the car and turn it back on, had my passenger get out and back in the vehicle, nothing would fix the light being on and the airbag indicator saying that the airbag was off. I'm extremely concerned and honestly don't understand why any vehicle would have a sensor that SHUTS OFF the airbag. There is already a recall for this issue in Suburu Foresters, years 2015-2018 I believe. I would also very much like this resolved in my model, it is extremely unsafe and I'd prefer not driving it at all but have no choice right now. I would be happy to have this inspected by someone. The internet suggested loose connections, or a faulty seatbelt, or the sensor itself which is connected to the passengers seat.

MY SAFETY IS AT RISK AS THE VEHICLE IS NOT OPERATING AS IT SHOULD AND I WAS TOLD BY SUBARU THAT THEY ONLY HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH I AM OUT OF AND BASICALLY TOO BAD OUR KNOWN ISSUE IS NOT SUBARUS RESPONSIBILITY ONCE YOU HIT A 100,000 MILES.  HOW IS A KNOWN STALLING ISSUE DUE TO A TRANSMISION FAILURE IN A VEHICLE NOT A SAFETY ISSUE AND A RECALL?????  WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THERE NOT BEING A RECALL? I NEED TO KNOW SO THAT IF AND WHEN MY SAFETY OR ANY OTHERS IS COMPROMISED GOD FORBID ANYONE IS HURT OR CRITICALLY INJURED, DUE TO THIS KNOWN PROBLEM,  WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED, WHO I WILL SUE.",

WE HAD MY SON'S FRIEND IN THE CAR, BOTH ARE ONLY 9/8 YEARS OF AGE, MY DAUGHTER, 11, HAD HER FRIEND IN THE CAR. WE WENT FROM THE LIBRARY DROPPED OFF MY SON'S FRIEND AND PROCEEDED HOME. WE WERE ALL LAUGHING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME AS WE PULLED IN TO THE  DRIVEWAY. ALL OF SUDDEN THE CAR HAD AN UNINTENDED ACCELERATED MOMENT AND RACED TOWARD THE GARAGE. ONCE THE VEHICLE FINALLY STOPPED THERE, WAS COMPLETE DEAD SILENCE. SKID MARKS ON MY DRIVEWAY. I IMMEDIATELY WENT IN TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP TO INFORM AND FIND OUT WHAT TO DO.  MARCH 14TH  LOADED 2 DOGS IN TO THE CAR TO GO TO THE PARK. AS WE BACKED OUT I SAW THE OTHER TWO AND DECIDED IT WOULD BE A FAMILY AFFAIR. WE HAVE 4 LABRADORS. SO AS I PULLED BACK IN TO THE DRIVEWAY AND AS WE (THE DOGS AND I) PULLED IN, THE CAR AGAIN ACCELERATED TOWARDS THE GARAGE. AT THIS POINT I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND SAID THAT IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN. STILL THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND EVEN CAME AND DROVE IT AT MY HOUSE WITH THE CAR COMPUTER ATTACHED TO A LAPTOP. WE DROVE IN AND OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY 2 TIMES.   *TR",
