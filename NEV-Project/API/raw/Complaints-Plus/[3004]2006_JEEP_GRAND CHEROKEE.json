They did my ignition recall as to what was wrong with the vehicle. So they say.. it was towed in because it would not turn over.. they gave me a new key and put in a \u201cnew ignition\u201d and still would not turn over.   The dealership said my key would not flash over with the computer?  Also, stating I needed a new skim module. Which they stated that Chrysler discontinued that part.  I was not offered a rental.. which is fine I guess.. I\u2019m a single mother of two kids. It has now been about four months about. I have never had in my life had the problems that I do now. My job is about to fire me, completely. The problems that I have had getting my children to and from school and doctor appointments, etc.  I\u2019m really at a loss for words.

WE NEED TO HOLD CHRYSLER/DODGE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CAR. INSURANCE COMPANIES NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. AND MOST.... A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT NEEDS TO BE FILED IF THERE ALREADY HASN'T BEEN.  YOU DON'T JUST MAKE VEHICLES AND WHEN IT HAS PROBLEMS TO THIS EXTENT CONTINUE ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TO DRIVE YOUR VEHICLES WITH NO PINPOINT ISSUE AVAILABLE TO FIX.

STILL NOTHING ON THE DIAGNOSTICS.  THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WE WOULD NOTICE A STRONG DOWNSHIFT WHEN COMING TO STOPS AND A \"CHUG\" WHEN SHIFTING OUT OF LOW GEARS.  FAST FORWARD TO 2018.

THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO BOB RICHARDS CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM (1666 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY, GRANITEVILLE, SC 29829 (855) 984-5458) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE SKID PLATE WAS GONE AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC FOR REPAIRS DUE TO THE LESS EXPENSIVE COST. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V438000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM), BUT THE FAILURE CONTINUED AND THE IGNITION WOULD INADVERTENTLY TURN. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT BELIEVED THAT THE FAILURE WAS RELATED TO THE WIRING HARNESS AND NOT THE IGNITION SWITCH. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED AND THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF, IT RESTARTED ITSELF SECONDS LATER. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE, BUT DID NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 152,000.",

THIS WAS A SUNNY JUNE MORNING, NOTHING ON THE ROAD. ITS LIKE THE JEEP HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN. AFTER SURGERY ON MY SHOULDER AND TRYING TO GET BACK TO WORK, I WAS FORCED TO GO ON DISABILITY. I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS RECALL YEARS AGO. MY LIFE HAS CHANGED BECAUSE OF IT. THE JEEP WAS A TOTAL LOSS OF COURSE.THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED ABOUT 10 MILES WEST OF IRON RIVER, MI ON US-2.

I USED BOTH FEET AND HANDS TO APPLY THE BREAKS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY WRAPPING BOTH HANDS AROUND THE LOWER HALF OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND PULLING UPWARD WITH MY BICEPS TO APPLY ADDITIONAL DOWNWARD MOMENTUM TO THE BREAK PEDAL, BUT STILL I COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE. INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED AND OUT POCKET COSTS FOR THIS ACCIDENT TOTAL OVER $7000 DOLLARS.   THE SECOND ACCIDENT HAPPENED IN 2016. NOT REALIZING THE VEHICLE WAS OFF WHILE ATTEMPTING TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A FULL STOP ON THE HIGHWAY (RTE.15 NO HAVEN, CT.), I HAD A COLLISION. THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT SLAMMED MY FACE INTO THE STEERING WHEEL. I WAS DAZED AND CONFUSED, WONDERING, WHY HADN'T THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. THIS IS THE SECOND INCIDENT I'VE HAD WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE IGNITION SWITCH. AND, IN BOTH ACCIDENTS AIRBAGS WERE NEVER DEPLOYED. ANY ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",

WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN PARK, WITH THE KEYS OUT OF THE IGNITION, ONE OF MY MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WAS ABLE TO SHIFT THE GEARS FROM PARK TO NATURAL. THE SUV WAS PARKED IN OUR DRIVEWAY WHICH HAS A SLIGHT DECLINE IN SLOPE. DUE TO THE DECLINE AND THE VEHICLE BEING IN NEUTRAL IT STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH MY FAMILY MEMBER INSIDE. WE WERE CLEANING THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT SO ALL THE DOORS WERE OPEN. THE JEEP PICKED UP SPEED, HIT OUR FENCE, AND ROLLED OUT ONTO A PUBLIC ROAD AND INTO OUR NEIGHBOR'S YARD. LUCKY NOBODY WAS HURT, EXCEPT FOR THE JEEP. THIS COULD HAVE KILLED A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY OR OTHER CIVILIANS AROUND THE SCENE. I HAVE HAD OTHER ISSUES WITH MY JEEP, ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN MADE INTO A RECALL WITHOUT FIXES. THIS RECALL IS ABOUT THE IGNITION SWITCH GOING FROM ON TO OFF WHILE DRIVING. I CAN SAY FROM EXPERIENCE THIS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES, AND IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN; YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR VEHICLE BESIDES HAVING BRAKES. YOU LOSS POWER STEERING AND EXPERIENCE ENGINE FAILURE IN THE MIDDLE OF BUSY TRAFFIC. BESIDES THAT RECALL, THE DRIVETRAIN BEING ABLE TO BE SWITCH IN A PARKED POSITION WITHOUT THE KEYS BEING IN THE IGNITION IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING, WHICH COULD HAVE KILLED MY SON, OR OTHERS AROUND. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING SAFE TO DRIVE MY FAMILY IN, AND THAT HAS FALLEN VERY SHORT FROM EXPECTATIONS . I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE VEHICLE ISSUES CAN BE SWEPT ASIDE; I MIGHT AS WELL KEEP MY OLD VEHICLE MADE IN 1984. PLEASE TAKE THESE COMMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

A FEW DAYS LATER THE CODE; SERVICE 4WD SYSTEM APPEARED ON THE DASH. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE DEALER FOR A DIFFERENT RECALL, I TOLD THEM OF THE PROBLEM AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK IF THE REFLASH HAD CAUSED THIS ERROR CODE. JUST LIKE I HAVE READ ON JEEP FORUM AND ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES, THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE N23 RECALL. THEY WANTED $350.00 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM,PLUS LABOR AND PARTS TO REPAIR THE CAR. I BELIEVE THE ANTIOCH JEEP DEALERSHIP KNOWS THAT THE RECALL REPROGRAMMING OF THE FINAL DRIVE CONTROLLER SHOWED THAT THERE IS A CRACKED CIRCUIT BOARD IN THE UNIT AND THAT IT IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN OVER 250,000 CARS.

ALL ELECTRICAL ON THE DASHBOARD STARTED BLINKING AND GAUGES WERE MOVING ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT REALLY SCARED ME AND SO I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SHUT OFF JEEP. IT TOOK A WHILE TO RESTART IT BUT AFTER WIGGLING THE BATTERY A LITTLE IT WORKED. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY JEEP AFTER FULLY REALIZING WHAT THE RECALL WAS ABOUT AND DOING SOME RESEARCH ON OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES. CHRYSLER GAVE ME A RENTAL CAR FOR 3 DAYS AND HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO ASSIST ME ANY FURTHER. MY JEEP IS NOW SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP.",

THE VEHICLE STARTED RIGHT UP WHEN I PUT IT IN PARK BUT THEN QUIT AGAIN APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS LATER WHEN I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE.  WE TOOK IT INTO A DEALERSHIP IN NAMPA AND THEY STATED THAT THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHY THE VEHICLE QUIT.  THEY INFORMED US THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM BUT PARTS TO FIX IT WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY TOLD ME PARTS MAY BE AVAILABLE IN SEPTEMBER. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A REMOTE MOUNTAIN AREA AND IF THE VEHICLE QUITS, I WILL NOT HAVE POWER BRAKES OR POWER STEERING WHEN DRIVING ALONG THE RIVER ON A VERY CURVY, TREACHEROUS ROAD.  I CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE PARKED UNTIL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE AT AN APPARENTLY UNKNOWN DATE. CHRYSLER DID SUGGEST THAT I HAVE THE IGNITION REPLACED AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT REIMBURSE ME.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE PARTS THEY CURRENTLY HAVE MAY OR MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST? WHAT HAPPENS IF THE VEHICLE QUITS AND THERE IS AN ACCIDENT? IS CHRYSLER AND/OR THE DEALERSHIP LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY AND/OR DAMAGES? THANK YOU.",

AS STATED IN THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT/COMPLAINT, I HAVE HAD TO LET MY DAUGHTER GET OUT OF THE CAR BY OPENING THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR FOR HER.

ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO I WAS TRAVELING IN CRUISE AT 70MPH STARTED TO NOTICE EVERY CRACK IN THE HWY MY HEADLIGHTS WOULD FLICKER, FIGURED ONE WAS GOING BAD. 15 MILES LATER MY DASH, RADIO, HEADLIGHTS, AND CRUISE ALL SHUT OFF ON ME. IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE THEY COME BACK ON (INCLUDING ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS), EXCEPT FOR MY CRUISE. REMEMBERING THE RECALL NOTICE, THE PARTS I CAN'T GET, AND THE FACT I WAS A SERVICE WRITER FOR 8 YEARS AT A DEALERSHIP, I REALIZED MY TRUCK HAD SHUT OFF AND TURNED BACK ON (MY KEY NEVER MOVED). SO AS I DRIVE ON IT STARTS DOING IT EVERY 20 MIN OR SO. THE NEXT DAY ON MY WAY HOME IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN. NOW WHEN I DRIVE SHORT DISTANCES IN THE COLD (NORTHERN WI) IT DOES NOT HAPPEN NEARLY AS MUCH, NOW LONGER DISTANCE WITH THE HEAT BLOWING THE WHOLE WAY IT HAPPENS REGULARLY, I ALSO NOTICE IF I TAKE THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION ITS VERY WARM ALMOST HOT.. THE LAST STRAW WAS THIS LAST WEEKEND, I WAS MAKING OUR YEARLY SPRING CABIN RUN, TRAVELING AT AROUND 35/40 MPH ON A GRAVEL ROAD MY ENTIRE TRUCK WENT DEAD, KEY WAS IN THE ON POSITION AND I LOST ALL POWER TO EVERYTHING , NOT WANTING TO LOSE CONTROL, I GRABBED FOR THE KEY ( AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE RECALL) AND I LITERALLY TURNED THE KEY FROM THE RUN POSITION TO OFF TO THE RUN POSITION AND IT RESTARTED (DOING THIS AS I'M ROLLING DOWN A GRAVEL ROAD WITH NO POWER BRAKES OR STEERING AT 35/40MPH). ALSO NOTED THAT IT WAS NOT JUST ME IN THE VEHICLE! I'VE READ, WATCHED VIDEOS ON THIS, TALKED TO OTHER OWNER AND NOW HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FIRST HAND. AFTER IT TURNING OFF COMPLETELY, THIS IS WAY MORE DANGEROUS THAN CHRYSLER IS ADMITTING.  MY NEXT STEP IS PUTTING A NEW \"BAD\" SWITCH IN, IF THIS ONE MADE IT 80,000 MILES WHY CAN'T THE NEXT, HOWEVER SADLY IT WILL BE ON MY DIME. HOPE THIS HELPS AND IF YOU HAVE THIS ISSUE BE VERY CAREFUL!  *TR",

EARLIER THAT MORNING ON MY WAY TO WORK, THE DASH QUIT WORKING 4 TIMES.  ALL GAUGES STOP WORKING AND DROP TO ZERO AND THE HEAT/AC QUITS.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY HEAD LIGHTS TURNING OFF/LOSING POWER ON 3 SEPARATE OCCASIONS. I AM ABLE TO SWITCH THEM FROM AUTOMATIC TO ON AND THEY WORK.  ONCE MY DASH \"FLICKERS\" AND RETURNS TO NORMAL, THE ENGINE LIGHT, TRACTION LIGHT AND ESP BAS LIGHT STAY ON.  THIS HAS BECOME A DAILY MALFUNCTION THAT OCCURS ON MY WAY TO AND FROM WORK.  THE FIRST TIME THIS OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2014, I DROVE STRAIGHT TO AUTO ZONE AND BOUGHT A BRAND NEW BATTERY.  THEY TESTED THE BATTERY AND SAID I NEEDED A NEW ONE.  THEY INSTALLED A NEW BATTERY AND CONNECTED POWER TO THE JEEP WHILE THEY CHANGED IT.  I FIGURED A BAD BATTERY WAS THE ISSUE AND IT WAS NOW FIXED.  A COUPLE DAYS LATER, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING A LOSS POWER TO MY DASH AGAIN.  I HAVE TAKEN MY JEEP TO 3 DIFFERENT JEEP DEALERSHIPS AND THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG BUT AN IGNITION SWITCH OR BAD BATTERY.  THEY ALL TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED THE IGNITION SWITCH PART FOR THE RECALL BUT I WILL RECEIVED A NOTICE IN THE MAIL WHEN THEY DO.  ONE JEEP DEALERSHIP CONTACTED AUTO ZONE AND TOLD THEM THE ONLY THING THEY COULD FIND WRONG WITH IT WAS THE BATTERY.  I WENT BACK TO AUTO ZONE AND THEY REPLACED MY BATTERY.  I HAVE HAD MY ALTERNATOR CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES AND IT TESTED GOOD.  THIS DEFECT/MALFUNCTION IS DANGEROUS AND A HAZARD TO MY LIFE AS WELL AS OTHER MOTORIST.

I WAS TOLD IT WAS ALL DUE TO THE KEY SWITCH BUT I HAVE NOW NOTICED THAT AS THE LIGHTS ARE ALL BLINDINGLY FLASHING THERE IS A GRINDING NOISE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS COMING FROM UNDER THE CAR NEAR THE FRONT. I AM NOT A MECHANIC SO I HAVE NO IDEA AND I DON'T HAVE MONEY TO TAKE MY JEEP IN AND HAVE THEM \"TRY\" TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND THEN CHARGE ME FOR POSSIBLY FIGURING IT OUT.

CALL THE EXPRESS SERVICE HOTLINE 1-866-849-3608 RIGHT NOW TO SCHEDULE YOUR FREE REPAIR\". IS IT BECAUSE IT IS FREE REPAIR THAT THERE IS NO HURRY TO GET THIS FIXED? I HAVE A CHILD! I ALMOST WRECKED.

MY CAR SUDDENLY STARTED DECREASING IN SPEED RAPIDLY, MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP AND IT WAS AS IF MY CAR HAD BEEN TURNED OFF. I HAD NO WHERE TO GO AS IT WAS SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN SEMIS ALL GOING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I TURNED ON MY HAZARDS UNTIL I WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I PUT MY CAR IN PARK, PUT THE KEY INTO THE OFF POSITION AND RESTARTED IT.I DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE TULSA,OK JEEP DEALERSHIP. TO SAY I WAS SHAKEN UP IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THEY RAN TESTS ON IT. CAME BACK TO ME AND TOLD ME THE CAR CHECKED OUT PERFECTLY FINE AND EITHER MY KNEE HIT THE IGNITION OR MY KEYS WERE TOO HEAVY. MY KEYS ONLY HAD MY CAR KEY, HOUSE KEY AND MY KEY FOB ON IT AND I KNEW MY KNEE HAD NOT HIT THE IGNITION. I WAS SCARED TO DRIVE MY CAR FROM THEN ON. THE INCIDENTS CONTINUED TO HAPPEN OVER AND CORE AGAIN.SOMETIMES AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, BUT ALSO LOTS OF TIMES AT A SLOW RATE OF SPEED UNDER 25MPH OR WHILE GOING FROM A STOP TO START (LIKE AT A STOP LIGHT OR WHILE TRYING TO TURN). I CONTINUED TO TAKE MY CAR IN TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP THE ENTIRE TIME IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY. I RECEIVED THE EXACT SAME ANSWER EVERY SINGLE TIME. THEY TREATED ME LIKE I WAS MAKING THE INCIDENTS UP. THE INCIDENTS STARTED HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY AND AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN WE WERE FINALLY IN A POSITION TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE. MY JEEP HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR OVER A YEAR.  WE ARE UNABLE TO SELL IT FOR ANYTHING CLOSE TO WHAT KBB SAYS ITS WORTH.

AS PER YOUR WEBSITE THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT PROVIDED A REASONABLY TIMELY SOLUTION WITHOUT COST TO OWNERS. SEE BELOW:    ***-A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE OWNER CAN DO IF THE OWNER IS UNABLE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AND WITHOUT CHARGE.*** (THIS WAS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WEBSITE IE WHAT NEEDS TO BE ON A RECALL NOTICE)    DRIVING MY 2006 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WITHOUT HAVING THE PROBLEM FIXED IS NOT AN OPTION, AS A LOSS OF BRAKES, STEERING AND EVEN AIRBAGS BEING UNRESPONSIVE AND WOULD RESULT IN MY INJURY OR DEATH. THE NOTICE SAYS SIMPLY TO REMOVE EXTRA KEYS FROM THE SWAB AND TO MOVE THE SEAT BACK. EXCELLENT PRECAUTIONS I AM SURE BUT MY PROBLEM CONTINUES TO ARISE NONETHELESS. DRIVING DOWN A HIGHWAY AT 55 MPH AND HAVING A LOSS OF POWER TO YOUR DASH, A LOSS OF BRAKES, AND POTENTIALLY NONWORKING AIRBAGS MAKE THIS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.     I AM FLOORED AT THE FACT A MAJOR CORPORATION HAS ISSUED A RECALL NOTICE, ONLY FOR 6 MONTHS TO HAVE PASSED WITH NO SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND JEEP BOTH SEVERAL TIMES TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THE FIX, ALL TO RECEIVE NO WORD OR NOTICE OF WHEN THE PARTS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE.     I HAVE ASKED SEVERAL TIMES IF I COULD HAVE THE VEHICLE FIXED AND THEN HAVE CHRYSLER REIMBURSE ME, AND WAS DENIED. I AM HOPEFUL THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AS CHRYSLER AND JEEP AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO. THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY.   *TR",

THESE PROBLEMS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN  LOSS OF GAUGES, FLASHING LIGHTS IN DASH, WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE TRACTION CONTROL OR BRAKES KICKING IN AND THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING? WHEN THIS FIRST STARTED HAPPENING I THOUGHT MAYBE THE COMPUTER HAD BEEN VIBRATED  OR JOSTLED AND HAD A GLITCH. OVER TIME IT WOULD GO AWAY AND 6 MONTHS OR SO LATER HAPPEN AGAIN! I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING, IE CHANGING PARTS AND TROUBLE SHOOTING THE PROBLEMS TO NO AVAIL. I THOUGHT I HAD THIS NARROWED DOWN TO A RUSTED CONNECTION FROM A GROUND WIRE CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK.....WRONG AGAIN! THIS MORNING I HAD MY 4 YEAR OLD SON IN THE JEEP AND WAS TAKING A LEFT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION. I CLEARLY HAD ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE THE TURN, BUT AS I WAS TURNING IT SOUNDED LIKE MY ANTI LOCK BRAKES WERE KICKING IN  MID TURN WITH A CAR COMING RIGHT AT US! I MADE THE TURN PULLED OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. ALL MY GAUGES WERE DEAD, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON AND ONLY THE GEAR SELECTOR WAS VISIBLE. I HAVE READ ON MANY JEEP RELATED FORUMS, THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY HAPPENING TO MY JEEP BUT MANY OTHERS! WHILE READING I HAVE NOTICED ONE THING. IN MANY CASES THESE PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED BY REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH! AFTER READING THIS I FURTHER RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AGAINST RECALLS. I FOUND THAT, ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, NY TIMES, USA TODAY AND FORBES, CHRYSLER IS ALLEGEDLY RECALLING THESE VEHICLES WITH FAULTY IGNITION SWITCHES. SO I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALER. THEY LOOKED MY JEEP UP IN THEIR DATABASE AND TOLD ME THEY'RE  WERE NO RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT THEY HAVEN'T RECALLED ANY VEHICLES FOR FAULTY IGNITION SWITCHES. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF THE NHTSA COULD HELP WITH SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AND ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTION I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE.  *TR",

THEY WILL REPLACE IT, BUT I FEEL THE TWO ISSUES ARE RELATED, AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE BILL. THE DEALER REINSPECTED ALL ABOVE COMPONENTS AND STATED THE SOFTWARE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY WITH THE ACTUATOR? SO END RESULT IS THEY WANT TO REPLACE THE ACTUATOR.

THE WHEEL LOCKED UP AND SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AND FORTUNATELY WITH THE HELP OF HER PASSENGER FORCED THE WHEEL TO MANEUVER TO THE SHOULDER. THANK GOD A TRACTOR TRAILED WAS NOT BEHIND HER!

WE CONTACTED THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY TOLD US IT WAS THE VALVE BODY OF THE TRANSMISSION WHICH WE REPLACED ($2100). AS IT TURNS OUT ON THE RETURN TRIP THE CAR TRANSMISSION WAS OVER HEATING AND THE SHUTTING DOWN SCENARIO CONTINUED. WE BROUGHT IT TO A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER HERE IN NJ AND THEY TOLD US THERE WAS PROBLEM IN THE ENGINE AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT APART IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I STOPPED RIGHT THERE. I FOUND OUT THROUGH MY LOCAL MECHANIC OF 20 YEARS THAT HE READ THE BULLETIN ON THE ENGINE PROBLEMS FROM CHRYSLER.

FOR ALL THREE HANDLES TO BREAK AT ONCE IS UNBEIVABLE AND FOR CHRYSLER TO FEEL THEY DO NOT OWE THE CONSUMER A RECALL TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION IS MIND BOGGLING.  I PERSONALLY HAVE CALLED AND VOICED MY OPINION AND WAS TOLD TO FIX IT MYSELF.  BELIEVE ME I WILL BE GOING TO MY LAWYER IN THE MORNING TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FILE A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST CHRYSLER AND TO ALSO HAVE DOCUMENTATION THAT I HAVE VOICED MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS SAFETY HAZARD TO NO AVAIL.  *TR",

I INITIALLY TOOK MY VEHICLE TO LITHIA DODGE IN SANTA FE, NM TO REPORT AN EXHAUST LEAK THAT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE AND WAS TO BE REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY ONLY REPAIRED THE PASSENGER SIDE WITHOUT APPARENTLY PERFORMING A LEAK CHECK.  THE FIX FOR THIS IS TO REPLACE THE OEM GASKET WITH ONE THAT INCORPORATES METAL TO APPARENTLY COMPENSATE FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE DISSIMILAR METALS OF THE HEAD/EXHAUST MANIFOLD.  SINCE THERE IS A DEFECT, THE GASKETS LEAK, AND THE UNEVEN EXPANSION CAUSES THE BOLTS/STUDS TO BREAK, EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM.    AFTER THE REPAIR THE SOUND SEEMED SIMILAR BUT I ASSUMED IT MUST BE INJECTOR OR VALVE/LIFTER NOISE.  RECENTLY I HAD MY TRANSMISSION SERVICED BY A LOCAL SHOP AND THEY NOTED THAT I HAD AN EXHAUST LEAK.  AGAIN I LISTENED AND IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM PASSENGER SIDE.  THIS TIME WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THE MECHANIC PERFORMED AN INSPECTION AND FOUND THE DRIVER'S SIDE TO BE LEAKING.  AGAIN HE ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE THE OEM GASKET WITH THE UPGRADED GASKET, BUT IN THE PROCESS BROKE A STUD OFF IN THE HEAD AND WAS UNABLE TO REPAIR WITHOUT EXCESS EXPENSE, NOW NOT UNDER WARRANTY, OF COURSE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS LEAKING AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPAIR IT, BUT THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE WAS NOT LEAKING.    IT'S OBVIOUS THE MANUFACTURER KNOWS THERE IS A DEFECT, SINCE THEY ISSUED AN UPGRADED GASKET.  THESE VEHICLES WITH THE 4.7L V8 SHOULD BE RECALLED AND THE PROPER GASKET INSTALLED.  I HAVE READ ON VARIOUS FORUMS ONLINE THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 4.7L V8 IN CHRYSLER PRODUCTS.

THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP WITH THREE INTACT WHEELS AND THE DRIVER'S SIDE WHEEL UNDERNEATH THE BODY.  FORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE WAS NOT AT HIGHWAY SPEED OR SEVERE INJURY OR DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLE, DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY AND THE LOSS OF ALL BRAKE SYSTEM HYDRAULIC PRESSURE, AS THE BRAKE LINE WAS ALSO SEVERED.    THE OEM NUT HOLDING THE PINCH WELD TO THE UPPER CONTROL ARM APPEARS INADEQUATELY DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND ROUTINE REMOVAL AND RETIGHTENING FOR SERVICE SUCH AS WHEEL ALIGNMENT AND SUSPENSION ADJUSTMENTS.  THERE APPEARS TO BE INADEQUATE ENGINEERING THOUGHT INTO ENSURING, AT A MINIMUM, A SIMPLE MECHANISM TO SECURELY FASTEN THE NUT (E.G., COTTER PIN, SERRATED FLANGE, OR OTHER LOCKING FEATURE).

I AM AFRAID TO HAVE MY GRANDCHILDREN RIDE IN MY CAR BECAUSE IF THEY NEEDED TO GET OUT IN A HURRY, THEY COULD BE STUCK OR WORST KILLED. DEALER SAYS NO RECALL AND $800.00 A PANEL TO REPLACE.

AS I WAS LOADING STUFF, THE LIFT GATE CAME CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD, WITH NO RESISTANCE.  IT HIT SO HARD THAT FOR A MOMENT, I WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED.  I TRIED TO LIFT IT OFF OF MYSELF, AND IT BOUNCED BACK OFF MY HEAD AGAIN.  I IMMEDIATELY GOT MYSELF INTO THE HOUSE TO SEEK HELP.  THE PAIN WAS UNBEARABLE AND I HAD TINGLING IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY FACE AND NECK, AND BURNING AND THROBBING PAIN IN MY HEAD AND RIGHT EAR.  I WAS IMMEDIATELY RUSHED TO THE DR'S OFFICE AND WAS TOLD THAT I HAVE A CONTUSION, WITH BLEEDING IN THE MUSCLE AND SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO A CONCUSSION.  I DID NOT LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS, BUT AM SUFFERING ALL SYMPTOMS.  I WAS TOLD TO KEEP ICE ON THE AREA AND TAKE TYLENOL FOR THE PAIN.  I NEED TO BE KEPT UNDER OBSERVATION FOR THE NEXT 24 HRS BY MY FAMILY.  MY FATHER HAS COME TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT WITH IT BEING 8 DEGREES OUTSIDE, THAT THE PISTONS WERE LACKING OR CONTAINED FROZEN FLUID, WHICH CAUSES THEM TO NOT WORK PROPERLY.  THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE, NOT ONLY TO ME, BUT TO OTHERS.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING REGARDLESS OF TEMPERATURE.  I AM THANKFUL THAT NO CHILDREN WERE STANDING NEXT TO ME, AS IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY CREATED A FATALITY WITH THE WEIGHT AND SPEED OF THE GATE CRASHING.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE FRONT HOOD PISTON REPLACED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THE BACK LIFT GATE BEING AN ISSUE.  I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS MY SECOND SUV AND I NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH MY OTHER SUV, NOT EVEN IN TEMPERATURE BELOW ZERO.    PLEASE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE GETS HURT, AS MOST PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OF THIS ISSUE, JUST LIKE I WAS.  I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS JEEP FOR A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AND IT HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS TECHNICALLY.  NOW THAT I HAVE GOTTEN THOSE FIXED, I PHYSICALLY GET INJURED BY IT. *TR",

IF I WAS ON A HILL GOING UP THE CAR WOULD TAKE OFF BACKWARDS.  DIES TURNING INTO PARKING LOTS, ETC.  I LOOSE POWER STEERING.  THE BRAKES STOPPED ME IF I APPLIED THEM.  HOWEVER, IF I WAS IN THE FORWARD MOVING POSITION, I WOULD JUST THROW IT IN NEUTRAL AND RE-START THE ENGINE WITHOUT PROBLEM. THIS CONCERNED ME, BECAUSE I BUY MY VEHICLES USED, I DID NOT KNOW IF DIRTY INJECTORS AND THROTTLE BODY WAS CAUSING CARBON RESIDUE TO CLOG THE INJECTORS SO I HAD IT ALL CLEANED.  THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I STARTED RESEARCHING ON THIS SITE AND SPOKE TO THE GUYS THAT DO MY SERVICE.  THE RESEARCHED AND FOUND A NOTICE ABOUT SAFETY.  I WENT TO JEEP WEBSITE AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS SUCH A NOTICE ABOUT THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE BUT NO RECALL.  SEVERAL WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE AND 2 COMPUTER FLASH UPDATES WERE NEEDED.

THEY CREATED A FILE (#860902) AND REFERRED ME TO THE NEAREST TIRE STORE NEAR MY HOME. AN INSPECTION OF THE TIRE BY THE STORE REVEALED NO ROAD HAZARD DAMAGE. THE TIRE WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. GOODYEAR REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRE AND ONLY OFFERED A 56% REIMBURSEMENT ON THE COST OF THE TIRE (NOT LABOR OR INSTALLATION). THE JEEP WAS PURCHASED NEW IN JANUARY 2006 AND ONLY HAD 13,000 MILES WITH 30% TREAD WEAR.  DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE REPLACEMENT TIRE FROM WWW.TIRERACK.COM. MAILED THE INVOICE TO GOODYEAR TODAY. HOPE TO RECEIVE A REFUND SOON. STILL AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THEY WON'T REFUND 100% OF THE COST OF THE TIRE. IN ADDITION, ALSO WORRYING IF THE REMAINING TIRES ON THE CAR WILL FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN AND BLOW UP. THE BLOWN-UP TIRE REVEALED 7 DOUGHNUT SHAPED HOLES ON THE SIDE.  *NM",

        "summary": "THIS CONCERNS AN UNSAFE DESIGN OF SUV.  I RENTED A 2006 JEEP CHEROKEE IN JAN.  2006 FROM AVIS RENTAL CAR COMPANY.  I AM A FREQUENT RENTER AND RENT A WIDE VARIETY OF AUTOS.     I WAS DRIVING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN THE JEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  BEING A VERY EXPERIENCED DRIVER I LOOKED AT THE RPM GAUGE AND NOTICED THAT THE RPM WAS ON \"0?? INDICATING THE JEEP WAS NOT RUNNING.  THE RADIO WAS STILL PLAYING (AS THIS IS A FEATURE COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAT THE RADIO WILL PLAY AFTER THE AUTO IS SWITCHED UNTIL THE DOOR IS OPENED).  I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL AND RESTARTED THE JEEP.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATTER THAT DAY THAT I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPEN BECAUSE IT HAPPENS AGAIN.   IN THE CHEROKEE, THE KEY SWITCH IS LOCATED LOW IN THE DASH FACING THE DRIVER. THIS LOCATION OF THE KEY SWITCH AND THE COMBINATION OF A LARGE KEY WITH A SELF-CONTAINED REMOTE ELECTRONIC DOOR OPENER MAKE IT POSSIBLE THAT THE TOP OF MY KNEE COULD HIT THE KEY SWITCH AND EFFECTIVELY SWITCH OFF THE AUTO WHILE IN MOTION.  I WAS ABLE TO ASSET THE PROBLEM AND REACT ACCORDINGLY BUT IF HAD BEEN MY WIFE OR MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT THAT OTHER WISE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNEXPLAINABLE.   WITH THE AUTO SWITCHED OFF MANY OF THE AUTO'S SYSTEMS DO NOT WORK.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS COULD SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE!!!  *NM",
