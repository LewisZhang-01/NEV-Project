WHEN THE NEWS BROKE ABOUT THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM I CALLED CRYSTAL TOYOTA.  THEY OFFERED TO CHECK THE CAR AGAIN BUT WAS TOLD WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ANALYSIS SINCE IT WAS NOT UNDER THE RECALL. SO I CALLED TOYOTA IN MORRISTOWN NJ WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE CAR IN 2001.  THE MANAGER TOLD ME TO CALL TOYOTA CORPORATE AT 800-331-4331.  I DID SO AND AFTER DESCRIBING THE CAR PROBLEM, WAS GIVEN CASE #1001138288 AND ASSURED THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL BACK WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY.  THE CALL NEVER CAME SO MY HUSBAND CALLED TOYOTA BACK.  THE REASON GIVEN TO US FOR NOT CALLING BACK WAS THAT OUR CAR WAS NOT IN THE RECALL.  THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE ALSO TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT THE PARTS UNDER RECALL WERE NOT INSTALLED IN THE 2001 HIGHLANDER AND TO CALL CUSTOMER RELATIONS AT CRYSTAL TOYOTA.  THIS TIME CRYSTAL OFFERED TO TEST DRIVE THE CAR FOR NO CHARGE BUT SAID THEY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT REPAIRING IT SINCE NO SUBSTITUTE PIECE FOR THE 2001 EXISTS.  SO THE PROBLEM REMAINS UNRESOLVED.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND I AM SURE THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER 2001 HIGHLANDERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. SINCE THOSE TWO EXPERIENCES I ONLY DRIVE THE CAR WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER.  UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT NHTSA UNTIL THIS WEEK.

ON 10/27/06 I STARTED CAR FOR 2-3 MINUTES TO POSITION IN FRONT OF GARAGE TO INSTALL FRONT BRAKE PADS. SHUT OFF AND STARTED TO JACK WHEN I NOTICED GAS DRIPS ON CEMENT, COMING FROM ABOVE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL AND DRIPPING DOWN & OFF STILL FAIRLY COOL EXHAUST PIPE REAR BANK OF V-6 . STARTED ENGINE AGAIN, CHECKED FOR LEAKS; NOTHING DETECTED. TOLD MY WIFE IT WAS INTERMITTENT, I FINALLY SAW LEAK EVIDENCE & FOR HER TO TAKE TO DEALER TO FIND THE LEAK; IT WAS ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS. SHE DIDN'T GET IN ON MONDAY 10/30/06 & WAS GOING TO DROP OFF ON WAY HOME 10/31/06 WHEN SMELL GOT VERY BAD AND IT DIDN'T RUN WELL.

I ASKED FOR POSSESSION OF FAILED PART; DAMPER- P/N 233270-62011. IT FITS IN MY CLOSED HAND, COST $97 & THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF WORK TO REPLACE. CHARGE WAS $426.00 BUT WAS LOWERED TO $310 WHEN WIFE REMINDED THEM THAT THEY BETTER HAVE SAVED THE REMOVED PART AS  I WANTED THE FAILED PART TO EXAMINE. WITH FAILED PART, I CHECKED WHERE IT WAS LOCATED AND THAT I COULD HAVE REPLACED IT MYSELF, WITHOUT REMOVING ANYTHING TO GET AT DAMPER, WITHIN 10 MINUTES. CHECKED FOR PRICE & AVAILABILITY OF PART WITH ANOTHER LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER; PARTS MAN SAID \"AH, THE OLD GASOLINE SMELL IN THE CABIN PROBLEM.\"  SAID HE SELLS THEM FAIRLY REGULARLY.

CONSIDERING THE OWNERS MANUAL DOES NOT SPECIFY THIS, AND THAT I OWN A LEXUS THAT HAS NO SIGNS OF PROBLEM AFTER FOLLOWING THE SAME SCHEDULE, WE WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH THEIR RESPONSE.  SINCE THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE  DEALERSHIP COULD GIVE US NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE, EVEN IF THEY CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 5000 MILES AS HE DIRECTED,  WE TURNED AROUND AND TRADED THE VEHICLE IN ON A HONDA THE SAME DAY.  I DID  CONTACT SW TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY ACCUSED US OF THE SAME FAULTY MAINTENANCE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER.   IT WAS OBVIOUS AFTER SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS THAT TOYOTA NO LONGER STANDS FOR QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  AS I INDICATED TO THEM IN A RECENT EMAIL AND A LETTER THAT I AM CURRENTLY DRAFTING, THEY HAVE LOST A TOYOTA OWNER FOREVER.  NOW THAT WE HAVE DIVESTED OURSELVES OF THE HIGHLANDER, I PLAN TO SELL THE LEXUS AS WELL.  I KNOW YOU DIDN'T NEED TO HEAR ALL THIS, BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.  TOYOTA  HONORED ITS CSP (ONCE IN EIGHT YEARS), BUT I UNSURE HOW MUCH THE REPAIR COST WERE.",

THIS VEHICLE LIKE ALL IN THE SOUTHEAST U.S AND LOTS OF OTHER AREAS HAS THE TINTED \"PRIVACY GLASS\" INSTALLED ON THE REAR WINDOWS WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO LESS LIGHT INSIDE THE VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT I DEPEND ON THE SPEEDOMETER TO KNOW HOW FAST I AM GOING WHEN ENTERING CURVES, ON-RAMPS, ETC.
