I also noticed another smaller crack in the panel surrounding the air bag, of which as also been recalled but no solution as of today. Upon researching further I find I am not alone,  this is an obvious defect in either part material or assembly and should be covered by a recall.  Dealer replacement for this will run around 1,000 dollars.

THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND AS WE HAVE TWO SMALL KIDS AND ALWAYS HAVE KIDS IN THE CAR. SO I TRIED TO OPEN A CASE WITH GM CUSTOMER CARE HOPING THEY WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AS THIS WAS A GM CERTIFIED VEHICLE AND THAT WARRANTY JUST EXPIRED 2 MONTHS AGO. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF IT. THEY GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY AND TOLD ME IT WAS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A RECALL ISSUED ON IT AND THEY AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME. THEY ADVISED ME TO TALK TO THE DEALERSHIP CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGER AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THEY COULD DO. I HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT GM PRODUCTS BUT THIS HAS CHANGED MY MINE. PEOPLES LIVES COULD BE AT STAKE HERE WITH DASHBOARDS CRACKING ALL AROUND THESE AIRBAGS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. I ADVISED THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND THEY ALL ACT SURPRISED!! I DRIVE A BIG SUV FOR MORE PROTECTION AND RELIABILITY FOR MY CHILDREN AND NOW I HAVE A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD WITH ONLY 69K MILES ON IT THAT WAS WORTH A TON OF MONEY THAT NOW IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK FOR ME WHEN I DRIVE WITH MY KIDS AND OTHER KIDS.
