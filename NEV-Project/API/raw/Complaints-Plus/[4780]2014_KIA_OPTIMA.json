A week later, the contact sought medical treatment for pain in his chest and right arm; the contact was diagnosed with a hairline fracture to his sternum.

My vehicle now sits at the local dealership with so many others waiting to go through the process of videoing the engine so they can send to corporate to approve a new engine.  In the meantime, I, along with other customers are left helpless and frustrated with no vehicle to drive for several months from what the local dealership is telling me. Kia is not taking care of their customers upfront by providing a loaner/rental vehicle.  Instead, thy say we can rent a vehicle and get reimbursed after our vehicle has been repaired.  How many people have many to rent a vehicle for months?  Not me!  I was told it would be a minimum of four months without my vehicle and some have been there much longer.  I am in desperate need of transportation for obvious reason (i. e. work, appointments, errands, unexpected situations, family obligations, etc....) I am hoping that you can advise what can I do to get Kia to step up and do the right thing upfront, especially for those who can't afford a rental vehicle.  I am also wondering if my 2014 Kia Optima should've even been sold to me in September 2017 with this known engine issue?  My research and websites show this issue was definitely before I made the purchase.  Kia failed their customers and not wanting to step up and issue a recall sooner shows that safety was not their top priority.  Thank you for any assistance you can provide.",

I had to limp over to the shoulder as traffic behind me began blaring horns. The shoulder I did find was a narrow gore, and I was very uncomfortable while getting a tow and ride setup. I was terrified I was going to be sideswiped at any moment. I was told by my trusted mechanic it was the Hybrid battery. The Dealership said the engine seized up, which also damaged the battery.

My safety was put at risk because I had to figure out how to get the vehicle towed.

KIA Consumer Affairs verified that I did not have a profile and I was not notified because I was not in their system. It is my problem to get a rebuilt engine for $6000 to update software and extend the \"Lifetime Warranty.\" It was inspected by Olathe KIA in Olathe, KS. They were not given any authority to repair this issue with the original engine failure. My insurance agent verified that they could not cover mechanical problems, only accidents. There were no warnings, no knocking (read other peoples statements on the PI 1803 KIA Forum testaments), no leaking, no smoke, or other signs. I had an oil change a week prior before this happen and there was no signs of any problems. My engine just gave out and never started again. KIA has ruined My Family's Life. We have no car to get to work. Losing my Job because I live 15-20 miles from my job. We only have 1 car. We are getting Evicted from our apartment. Domino affect with My Life. I still have a car payment and car insurance I have to pay for. Why, won't they fix their engines? It's there problem when the vehicle was manufactured.

CALL  KIA 3 TIMES ON 02/19/2018 FIRST TIME I WAS SAYING THAT MY CAR STILL WASN'T FIXED FROM THE LONG BLOCK THAT WAS REPLACED ON THURSDAY THAT WAS STILL MAKING FUNNY NOISES AND THAT THERE WAS A SWEET BURNING SMELL.  WAS TOLD BY THE 1ST PERSON I TALKED TO GIVE IT TIME AND IT WILL WORK ITSELF OUT. THAT SWEET SMELL WAS THE OIL BURNING OFF OF THE ENGINE THAT THEY JUST REPLACED AND THAT IT WAS NO BIG DEAL. I CALL BACK NOT EVEN AN HOUR LATER TO SAY MY HEAT STOPPED WORKING THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC RUN ON IT AND THEN IT WILL COST ME $99 AND IF THEY DETERMINE WASN'T PART OF THE ENGINE WORK THEY HAD JUST DONE. THAT PERSON MADE A 10 A.M. APPOINTMENT FOR 2/20/2018. SINCE MY HEAT WASN'T WORKING I HAD TO KEEP USING MY WIPERS AND FLUID, BECAUSE THE DEFROST WASN'T WORKING.

I CONTACTED DEALERSHIP AND AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH BY THEM, THEY SAID THEY COULD ELECTRONICALLY CHANGE THE MODE OF THE POWER STEERING. THERE SEEM TO BE 2 MODES AVAILABLE AND ONE OF THEM MAKES THE STEERING FLIMSY AND HARD TO HANDLE AND THE OTHER MAKES IT FEEL MORE STABLE LIKE A STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE.  I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM TO CONTACT THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND ASK FOR THE MODE CHANGE.  MOST DEALERSHIP STAFF DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS OPTION EXISTS AND SOME SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH IT EITHER BUT APPARENTLY IT DOES EXIST.  I WOULD NOT HAVE KEPT THIS VEHICLE IF THEY COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED THE POWER STEERING MODE BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE.      AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A MODE FEATURE ON THE DASHBOARD OR A DISPLAY FUNCTION THAT SOME OF THE OTHER KIA MODELS HAVE.  THIS IS SPECIFICALLY SOMETHING THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO DO ELECTRONICALLY AND THEY CAN DO THIS ON THE LX MODEL.    ONE OTHER FEATURE I JUST DISCOVERED THAT I DON'T LIKE AND THINK MAY BE AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM IS THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW PASSENGER SEAT.
