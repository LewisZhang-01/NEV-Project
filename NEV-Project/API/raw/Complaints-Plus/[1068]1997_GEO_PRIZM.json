AT THIS TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS DRIVER ERROR, BUT A MONTH LATER, THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON.  AFTER EXTENSIVE DIAGNOSIS AND REPLACEMENT OF MASTER CYLINDER AND 1 BRAKE CALIPER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BRAKE PROPORTIONING VALVE WAS FAULTY, SINCE AIR COULD NOT BE BLED FROM THE LF CALIPER.  COST OF NEW VALVE FROM DEALER - $250.  I THEN RESEARCHED THE INTERNET TO SEE IF OTHERS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND FOUND AN ARTICLE ON TOYOTA'S SITE (GEO PRIZM'S ARE MADE IN THE SAME PLANT IN FREMONT, CA ALONGSIDE TOYOTA COROLLAS) STATING THAT THE \"FACTORY SUPPLYING BRAKE PROPORTIONING VALVES TO TOYOTA'S AUTO PLANTS HAD A MAJOR FIRE ON 2/1/97\"  THE FIRE AT THIS COMPANY \"AISIN\" DESTROYED THE MACHINERY THAT FABRICATES PROPORTIONING VALVES.  THEY THEN CONTACTED OUTSIDE COMPANIES (BROTHER INDUSTRIES, A SEWING MACHINE MANUFACTURER) TO MAKE THE PROPORTIONING VALVES DESPARATELY NEEDED BY TOYOTA.   WHAT A COINCIDENCE THAT MY \"AISIN\" PROPORTIONING VALVE WAS DEFECTIVE.  I HAVE KEPT THE VALVE AND ARTICLE.  YOU MAY READ THE ARTICLE AS \"HTTP://WWW.TOYOTA.COM/TIMES/MANU/FEATURE/NUMMI.HTML\"",
