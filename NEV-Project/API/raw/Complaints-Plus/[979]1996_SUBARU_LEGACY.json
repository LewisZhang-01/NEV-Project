THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT.  WE THEN TO THE CAR TO CARR CHEVROLET IN BEAVERTON, OR.  THEY DID A LOT OF CHECKING ON THE CAR AND SAID THEY WOULD LIKE A FACTORY REP. TAKE A LOOK AT IT.  WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A FACTORY REP. AND HE DROVE THE CAR AND SAID THAT IT WAS DOING JUST WHAT WE HAD SAID AND THAT HE HAD HEARD OF A COUPLE OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME TYPE.
