When driving in slippery snow, sand, ice, etc., the front wheels spin, but there is no power transmitted to the rear wheels, causing serious control and traction problems.  An \"all-wheel-drive-locked\" signal appears on the info display, followed instantly by \"AWD disabled\". After a while (a couple minutes), the system then comes back and says \"Automatic AWD restored\". Which is simply not true\u2014AWD never engages, but a driver going into a snowstorm or other difficult situation has no way of knowing this until it's too late. Problem was diagnosed by a good mechanic as a faulty transfer case\u2014a very common problem in 2002\u20142011 AWD Ford Escapes. There is a serious design problem\u2014the transfer case is too close to the exhaust, which cooks the internal lubricant, causes it to leak out completely, and kills the bearings inside the case. There are many cases on forums of this problem causing locked wheels at speed, sudden lack of drive on highways, etc. Not to mention the problem (as in my case) of drivers entering dangerous driving situations where they are counting on AWD for safe driving, but having just front wheel drive, with absolutely no warning from the car. I have no idea why this has not resulted in a. recall so far, but it is an serious, obvious (and worsening) safety issue. Parts and labor cost will be over $1000.

Family member left to go home for the afternoon and stated that they almost hit a herd of deer, because the brakes went straight to the floor.  They drove back for the evening program, with the same problem.  I drove home about 35 miles an hour, and the brake pedal goes straight to the floor.  No noise of any kind, no warning, no puddles where the car was parked at church or at home.  The brake light is on now.   What in the world.  This could be fatal... both of these issues.   FORD just told me there are no recalls, and then sent me to a survey.  They need to look into these issues....Poor customer service in my opinion  and could be a fatal situation.

ONE DAY I WAS VISITING HER, AND MY HORN WENT OFFF, SO I USED MY KEY FOB TO TURN IT OFF, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. THAT'S WHEN WE REALIZED IT WAS HER CAR GOING OFF.  BARELY A COUPLE MINUTES LATER, HER HORN WENT OFF AGAIN. SHE WENT TO TURN IT OFF AND IT WOULDN'T WORK, BECAUSE THIS TIME IT WAS MY CAR.  THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE MOST OBNOXIOUS YET.

THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS INDICATING LOW OIL UP UNTIL THIS POINT.  I HAD RECENTLY HAD MY OIL CHANGED ABOUT 8 WEEK AND LESS THAN 1000 MILES PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT AND THERE WERE NO LEAKS SO IT SEEMS VERY IMPROBABLY THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE USED 4 QTS OF OIL IN THAT TIME.

ONCE THE BASE PLATE AS INSTALLED, IT WAS USUALLY HIDDEN BY THE BUMPER AND FRONT FACADE OF THE VEHICLE. ON JULY 25, 2088 WHILE DRIVING, THE BASE PLATE FAILED WHICH CAUSED THE TOW VEHICLE TO SWING VIOLENTLY BACK AND FORTH ACROSS LANES OF TRAFFIC. THE METAL BRACKET ON THE BAS PLATE ATTACHING IT TO THE TO VEHICLE (FORD ESCAPE) WAS RIPPED FROM THE METAL BEAM PART OF THE BASE PLATE SPANNING THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE JOINT BETWEEN THE BRACKET AND BASE PLATE BEAM. IN TOTAL THERE WAS ABOUT $10,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO BOTH THE MOTOR HOME AND THE TOW VEHICLE. ANOTHER BASE PLATE WAS SENT TO THE CONSUMER AND INSTALLED ON THE VEHICLE.  ON JULY 25, 2012, WHILE DRIVING AND USING THE ALLEGEDLY REDESIGNED BLUE OX BASE PLATE, THE CONSUMER DISCOVERED THE TOW VEHICLE HAS BECOME DISCONNECTED AND FOUND THAT ONCE AGAIN THE BASE PLATE FAILED.

IF THE FAULT REMAINS, THE VEHICLE MAY REQUIRE RESETTING THE SHUT-OFF SWITCHES.' FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUE DRIVING WITHOUT RESETTING ANY SWITCHES. THE WARNING LIGHT REMAINED OFF AND HAS NOT COME BACK ON AGAIN. I HAVE SHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A DEALER. IN THE MEAN TIME I HAVE SEARCHED THE WEB FOR DRIVERS WITH SIMILIAR EXPERIENCES AND HAVE COME ACROSS QUITE A FEW.  I PERSONALLY DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT CAN SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING, ESPECIALLY ON A BUSY HIGHWAY. THE FACT THAT FORD HAS INSTRUCTIONS IN THE OWNERS MANUAL FOR 'RESETTING THE FUEL PUMP/HIGH VOLTAGE SHUT OFF SWITCHES' IS ALARMING IN ITSELF ESSENTIALLY I CAN BE TRAVELING IN URBAN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC AND A COMPUTER CAN DECIDE TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  I URGE YOU TO REQUIRE FORD TO ADDRESS THIS DEFECT.  *TT",

THE BELT BEGAN TO RATCHET TIGHTER AND TIGHTER, AND BECAME SO CONSTRICTED THAT SHE HAD TO FACE OVER THE BACK SEAT.  6. I HELD THE BELT TO STOP THE RATCHETING, WHILE A FRIEND RAN IN TO GET A PAIR OF SCISSORS.   THE BELT WAS INCREDIBLY TIGHT ON HER - WE COULD NOT EVEN MOVE IT UP OR DOWN ON HER WAIST AND SHE WAS CRYING BECAUSE IT WAS CUTTING IN TO HER SIDES.  7.

THE BELT IS UNDER WARRANTY AND WILL BE REPLACED AT NO CHARGE.    I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS COULD BE PREVENTED, AS THE RATCHETING FUNCTION OF THE SEATBELT IS NECESSARY FOR CHILD SEAT RESTRAINTS (CAR SEATS).  HOWEVER, IT WAS THE RATCHETING OF THE BELT THAT PUT MY DAUGHTER IN SO MUCH DANGER, AS ONCE THE SEATBELT BEGINS RATCHETING, IT WILL NOT RELEASE UNTIL IT IS FULLY RETRACTED.

I DISCOVERED THE FIX WAS REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY AND IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM.  I CALLED KENDALL FORD (MY DEALERSHIP) AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR MY SERVICE MANAGER.  HE RETURNED MY CALL IN LESS THAN 45 MINUTES.  I EXPLAINED, HE LISTENED, HE TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN AND SAID THERE IS NO RECALL SO I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.  I BROUGHT IN MY VEHICLE AND LEFT IT AND WENT TO WORK.  I CALLED FORD CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN DETROIT AND SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE, THE LADY WHO ANSWERED.  SHE TOOK MY VIN NUMBER.  I TOLD HER I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND THIS WAS AN ONGOING ISSUE DATING BACK TO AT LEAST 2001.  I ASKED WHY NO RECALL SHE SAID FORD MONITORS REPAIRS AND HAD NOT DEEMED THIS A PROBLEM.  I TOLD HER IT WAS A KNOWN ISSUE AND I WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH MY STATE AG AND SHE TOLD ME SHE WOULD NOTE IT.  MY CAR WAS DELIVERED TO ME AT WORK AND THE COST WAS $305.43; $140.53 FOR PARTS AND $164.43 FOR LABOR.  I CALLED MY SERVICE MANAGER AND ASKED ABOUT THE COST.  HE VERIFIED IT.  HE TOLD ME THEY HAD DONE THIS REPAIR \"MANY\" TIMES ON THIS MODEL OF VEHICLE.

AT 40 MPH SLIGHT VIBRATION  AS SPEED IS INCREASED 70 MPH IT WAS  MORE PREVALENT.  IT WAS  NOT A SMOOTH RIDING TIRE NEVER FELT THIS WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE WE HAVE PURCHASED.  FEEL THIS COULD BE A DANGEROUS PROBLEM WITH CONTINENTAL  REPUTATION AND ONLY 300 MILES ON VEHICLE AT THAT TIME AND NOW CLOSE TO 1000 MILES NOW.  NEED NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS TIRE BECAUSE OF DEALERS AND FORDS NEGLECT.  DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS THE TIRES OR THE VEHICLE.  WITH FORD'S PROBLEM WITH THEIR TIRES IN THE PAST AND WITH THE INJURIES AND DEATHS THAT HAD OCCURRED I THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT BY NHTSA AND FORD.  RODE IN ANOTHER FORD EDGE WITH THE SAME TIRES WITH THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP SAME PROBLEM WITH VIBRATION BUT NOT AS BAD AS MY PERSONAL VEHICLE.  OWNER OF DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM.  OWNER OF DEALERSHIP MADE A CALL TO REPRESENTATIVE OF FORD FOR OUR AREA WAITING FOR A DATE TO MEET WITH HIM AND DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM AS OF TODAY. TRYING TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT MY TIRE NAME AND SIZE AND VEHICLE NAME WAS NOT ON YOUR LIST SO I JUST PICKED ONE SO I COULD SEND THIS TO YOU AGAIN MY TIRE IS CONTINENTAL CROSS CONTACT LX  24560R18 ON A 2007 FORD EDGE.
