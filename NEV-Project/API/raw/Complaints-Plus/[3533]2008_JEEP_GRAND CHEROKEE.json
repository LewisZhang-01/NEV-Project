THE NEXT DAY HE SHOWED ME WHAT HAPPENED....THE WATER-PUMP INTERNAL BEARING HAS BROKEN CAUSING THE SHAFT TO MOVE BACK AND FORTH CAUSING THE INTERNAL WATER-PUMP FLYWHEEL TO BREAK APART.  THIS CAUSED THE WATER PUMP TO DUMP ALL THE COOLANT ON THE GROUND WITHIN 15 TO 20 MINUTES.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS WAS THE ENGINE SEIZED DUE TO LACK OF COOLANT PUMPING THRU THE ENGINE. A NEW ENGINE WAS THE ONLY SOLUTION.

ALMOST EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO SAY THEY NEVER NOTICED THIS BEFORE.ONE MECHANIC AT GOODYEAR WENT BACK INSIDE AND CHECKED TO SEE IF THESE TIRES ARE CONSIDERED OMNIDIRECTIONAL,AND FOUND THAT THEY ARE NOT. ALSO EVEN READING REVIEWS ON THIS TIRE,I FOUND NO ONE WHO SEEMS TO GET MORE THAN 35,000 MILES OFF THESE TIRES. CAN YOU HELP ME GET TO THE ROOT  OF THIS COMPLAINT.OR IS IT JUST ME ?

UPON READING THE RECALL NOTIFICATION SENT OUT, FCA RECOGNIZES THAT THE \"WIN POSITION SPRING BACK MAY ALSO CAUSE THE DISABLING OF ONE OR MORE OF THE VEHICLE'S SAFETY FEATURES INCLUDING THE FRONTAL AIRBAGS.\"    AT APPROXIMATELY 120,000 MILES, THE AIRBAG LIGHT WENT OFF AGAIN AND WAS INTERMITTENTLY ILLUMINATED UNTIL 123,000 MILES, WHERE THE LIGHT HAS STAYED CONTINUOUSLY ON.  I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER TO INQUIRE IF THEY HAD PARTS, AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS IN STOCK FOR THE RECALL, BUT I WAS ADDED TO A WAITING LIST.  UPON REQUESTING INFORMATION ON THE AIRBAG, I WAS IMMEDIATELY TOLD THAT THE AIRBAG WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL, EVEN THOUGHT HE NOTIFICATION SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE AIRBAGS.  THE CLERK GAVE ME A 1-800 NUMBER FOR JEEP.    I CALLED THE JEEP 1-800 NUMBER AND WAS CONNECTED TO AN AGENT WHOM I INQUIRED ABOUT THE AIRBAG AS WELL AND WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO DIAGNOSE THE AIRBAG.  WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY TO DIAGNOSE THE AIRBAG IF THE RECALL NOTIFICATION MENTIONS THAT THE AIRBAGS COULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  I FEEL THAT JEEP SHOULD BE DIAGNOSING THE AIRBAGS ON THE CUSTOMER'S BEHALF.  THIS RECALL HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST A YEAR WITH THEM JUST GETTING TO A RESOLUTION.

WHY IS CHRYSLER NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY CAR TROUBLES AFTER THE RECALL (WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE)?  THE GOVERNMENT FINED CHRYSLER 70 MILLION DOLLARS AND WILL FINE ADDITIONAL MONIES IF THE VEHICLES ARE NOT REPAIRED.  WHY AM I SUFFERING AND NOT BEING ACCOMMODATED WITH A WORKING VEHICLE WHEN THE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY (CHRYSLER) HAS A MISHAP?  MY EXPERIENCE:   - WHEN VEHICLE IGNITION IS TURNED OFF IT ONLY GOES  THE WAY, THE KEY FOB STICKS AND WILL NOT EXIT.  THIS CAUSES THE RADIO CLOCK LIGHT AND THE GEAR SHIFT PANEL TO STAY LIT, WHICH IN TURN DRAINS THE BATTERY. (HAD TO PURCHASE A JUMP START KIT $70.00 + TAX) FOR WHEN THE BATTERY IS DEAD.  -SINCE, THE KEY WILL NOT EXIT THE IGNITION I MUST LEAVE MY WORK AREA AT LEAST TWICE A DAY (SOMETIMES MORE) TO CHECK, IF THE KEY FOB WILL COME OUT.  ONCE IT TOOK 11 HOURS BEFORE KEY WOULD EXIT, AFTER RUNNING THE ENGINE FOR OVER 3 HOURS.   I AM IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING MY LIVELIHOOD IF THIS ISSUE CONTINUES FOR MUCH LONGER.  IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS.  THE RECALL STARTED NOVEMBER, 2014.  HOW LONG WILL I SUFFER, BECAUSE I DONT HAVE MONEY TO PURCHASE A DIFFERENT VEHICLE AND WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS AFFECT THE MOST UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUALS LIKE ME.  -THERE IS A 90% CHANCE THAT MY VEHICLE WILL BE STOLEN (SINCE KEY IS LEFT IN THE IGNITION). I WORK IN DURHAM, NC ON THE WEEK-END; I PRAY THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO RALEIGH IF THIS HAPPENS.  I CRY MOST NIGHTS IN FEAR OF LOSING MY JOBS.  PLEASE, HELP ME!!!!!!",

I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH CHRYSLER AS TO WHEN I CAN GET INFO ON THE PART. I GET NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH TIME AND VACATION DAYS TO GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF. I GET NOTHING. I HAVE TO PAY UPFRONT FOR MY RENTAL CAR WHICH CHRYSLER TELLS ME I CAN THEN APPLY FOR A REIMBURSEMENT THAT TAKES 60 DAYS TO GET BACK IF APPROVED. I AM MAKING PAYMENTS ON A DEAD CAR THAT HAS NO SOLUTION TO IT. IN THE MEANTIME, THE DEALERSHIP IS TELLING ME THAT IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHRYSLER DIRECTLY. I AM STUCK AND OUT OF OPTIONS I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND CHRYSLER DOESN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT I FULLY TRUSTED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE BY MAKING THIS PURCHASE FOR MY FAMILY'S MAIN TRANSPORTATION. PLEASE IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO TO FURTHER DISCUSS MY SITUATION TO GET A BETTER RESPONSE FROM CHRYSLER PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYLER JEEP VEHICLE IN MY LIFETIME.",

AT FCA, I SPOKE WITH A VERY NICE AND LIKELY VERY YOUNG WOMAN NAMED STEPHANIE WHO INFORMED ME THAT CHRYSLER DOES NOT HAVE A SUBCONTRACTOR TO MAKE THE PART NEEDED TO MAKE THE REPAIR.  SHE INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD BE PLACED ON THE \"LIST\" OF THOSE TO BE NOTIFIED BY EMAIL WHEN A PART BECAME AVAILABLE.  THAT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE ANSWER AND I TOLD HER I WOULD BE CONTACTING THE NHTSA WITH MY COMPLAINT.  NOW ON YOUR SITE, I SEE THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HOLD HEARINGS ON RECALL REPAIR DELAYS BY CHRYSLER AND CLEARLY MY STORY FALLS WELL WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS.  LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO BREAK THROUGH THIS LOGJAM....THREATEN NOT TO LOAN THEM MONEY THE NEXT TIME THEY SCREW UP OR WHATEVER.  THANKS.",

PRIOR TO THIS THERE WERE TWO INCIDENTS THAT MAY BE RELATED, AROUND A MONTH OR TWO BEFORE THE MOTOR TURNED OFF WHILE IN TRAFFIC, I SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND RESTARTED.  I THOUGHT I MAY HAVE HIT THE KEY WITH MY KNEE.  THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS THAT THE AIRBAG ALARM ON THE DASH CAME ON, HAD IT DIAGNOSED AT A LOCAL GARAGE AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS THE PASSENGER SEATBELT WAS DEFECTIVE SO I BELIEVE HE DISARMED THE AIRBAG. AFTER LOOKING ONLINE IT SEEMS THAT THESE ARE REPETITIVE PROBLEMS WITH CHRYSLER PRODUCTS. AND ARE RELATED TO THE L25 RECALL. THIS IS NO CHEAP FIX $750 FOR MODULE AND 2 KEYS. ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *TR",

DUE TO A VIN NUMBER ISSUE WITH A REPLACEMENT PROGRAM, CHRYSLER REFUSED TO REPLACE THE KEY ASSEMBLIES THOUGH THEY WERE REPLACING IDENTICAL ASSEMBLIES ON OTHER VEHICLES THAT USED THE SAME MODULES. SEVERAL \"REPROGRAMMING\" HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO CLEAR PROBLEMS. SPECIFIC ISSUES INCLUDE:  1. ERRATIC BEHAVIOR OF ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT STEMS FROM THE OPERATION OF THE IGNITION SWITCH. FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGINE WILL START BUT THE VEHICLE WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK AND THE RADIO/NAVIGATION WILL NOT WORK UNTIL YOU JIGGLE THE IGNITION SWITCH AND KEY FOB.  2. CHRONIC FAILURE OF THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE. YOU CAN BE DRIVING ALONG AT ANY SPEED AND YOU WILL LOSE THROTTLE CONTROL. THIS HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEAR MISS ACCIDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND LIGHTING OF AN SPECIFIC IDIOT LIGHT ON THE DASH. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF THROTTLE RESPONSE IS VERY DANGEROUS AND CAN BE RESTORED BY ONLY STOPPING THE VEHICLE AND SHUTTING DOWN THE ENGINE SEVERAL TIMES TO RESET THE ELECTRONICS.  3. CHRONIC FAILURE OF THE DEALERSHIP TO ADDRESS PROPER CORRECTION OF THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. VEHICLE WAS COVERED BY A FULL WARRANTY AND AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT THESE PROBLEMS WERE NEVER REPAIRED. DUE TO SPORADIC AND RANDOM NATURE OF THE SYSTEMS FAULTS, THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO MAKE REPAIRS.  4.

LOCAL WATERWAY CAR WASH IS REFUSING TO WASH THESE VEHICLES DUE TO RAPID AND  UNATTENDED ACCELERATION ISSUES WHICH HAVE CAUSED ACCIDENTS AT THEIR CAR WASHES.

AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT, I HAD THE RECALL DONE. IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH 4LO NO LONGER WORKING, AND \"SERVICE 4WD\" MESSAGES SHOWING ON THE DASH. THESE ARE MY SYMPTOMS ALSO. PEOPLE THAT FLAT TOW THE JEEP BEHIND A MOTOR HOME COULD NO LONGER SWITCH THE TRANSFER CASE TO NEUTRAL (IRONIC HUH?). WHAT DOES CHRYSLER DO? THEY DON'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PROBLEM. A YEAR AFTER THE FIASCO STARTED, THE DEALER THAT DID MY RECALL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE? APPARENTLY CHRYSLER DEALERS LOADED DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE OR INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE IMPROPERLY. THE SOFTWARE CANNOT BE UNLOADED AND REVERTED TO BEFORE THE RECALL. CHRYSLER'S ANSWER WHEN I CALLED 800 NUMBER YESTERDAY, OVER A YEAR SINCE THIS RECALL FIASCO STARTED, WAS FOR ME TO PAY THE DEALER TO DIAGNOSE THE SYMPTOM AND IF THE DIAGNOSTIC CODE IS CORRECT, THEY'LL RELOAD THE SOFTWARE...AFTER I'VE PAID THE SERVICE CALL! THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF POSTS ON LINE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE N23 RECALL, BOTH ON AUTOMOTIVE SITES AND RV SITES FROM OWNERS THAT FLAT TOW THEM. AND CHRYSLER HAS THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND...OR ELSEWHERE. THIS IS THE BIGGEST SCAM.  PER THE POSTS, CHRYSLER IS CHARGING PEOPLE THOUSANDS TO REPLACE COMPONENTS WHEN IT'S THE RECALL THAT STARTED THE PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS IMMEDIATELY WHEN TRYING TO ACTUATE 4 LO.  IT DOESN'T GO INTO 4 LO AND THE SERVICE 4WD MESSAGE OCCURS ON THE INFORMATION CENTER. I HAD TO SHOW THE DEALER THE SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER CALLING ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM, FROM POSTS ON THE WEB.  THAT TELLS ME THAT CHRYSLER IS NOT EVEN INFORMING THEIR OWN DEALERS ABOUT THE PROBLEM CREATED BY THE N23 RECALL.  AND THE QUADRATRAC II TRANSFER CASE WITH THE 4LO CAPABILITY IS AN OPTION UPGRADE.

THE VERY INNOCUOUS RECALL NOTICE SPOKE OF THE DOT REQUIRING THE RECALL BASED ON A NUMBER OF CASES WHERE THE TRANSFER CASE SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL ON IT'S OWN AND THE VEHICLE ROLLED AWAY, CAUSING DAMAGE.  THE RECALL WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE FIX WAS TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR A SOFTWARE REPROGRAMMING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE.  THE RECALL NOTICE WAS VERY CAREFULLY AND CLEVERLY WRITTEN TO LEAVE ONE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT A SOFTWARE ISSUE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, AND JEEP WAS GOING TO FIX IT WITH THE REFLASH OF THE TRANSMISSION COMPUTER.  THIS IS NOT TRUE.  THE ISSUE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF HARDWARE IN THE TRANSFER CASE, AND THE ?FIX? OFFERED BY JEEP IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BAND AID TO MEET THE STRICT LETTER OF THE DEMAND BY THE NHTSA.  AS THOUSANDS OF JEEP OWNERS ARE NOW LEARNING, AFTER THE RECALL THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THE TRANSFER CASE WILL NO LONGER SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL, OR 4WD LOW, AT ALL.  I HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF DOZENS OF JEEP OWNERS WITH THESE ISSUES WHO NEVER HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE THE RECALL. THIS PROBLEM CREATES A GREAT UNCERTAINTY AMONG OWNERS.  WE DON'T KNOW IF THE 4WD SYSTEM WILL WORK WHEN NEEDED, OR END UP STUCK IN NEUTRAL OR 4WD LOW, MAKING THE VEHICLE UNUSABLE.  WHILE NOT BEING ABLE TO TOW MAY NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE, I THINK THAT DISABLING A 4WD SYSTEM THAT MANY PEOPLE RELY ON IN BAD TERRAIN OR WEATHER WOULD BE.  I DON'T THINK THAT NHTSA HAS MONITORED THIS SITUATION PROPERLY AND HAS ALLOWED CHRYSLER TO COMMIT WHAT AMOUNTS TO A FRAUD UPON THEIR CUSTOMERS.  I THINK NHTSA NEEDS TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

RELAY WAS NOT REPLACED AS THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THE PART OF ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER.    THE ELECTRICAL CUT OUT OCCURRED AGAIN ON 6/21/2013 BUT CLEARED UP IMMEDIATELY UPON A VEHICLE RESTART.     ON 6/23/2013 WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH THE ENGINE CUT OUT AGAIN.  THE ELECTRICAL WAS ALSO OUT, LEAVING ME WITH A DEAD VEHICLE AND NO ELECTRONICS TO SIGNAL.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS THE VEHICLE WAS RESTARTED.  I BELIEVE THAT POSSIBLY THE ELECTRONIC FUEL PUMP WAS CUT OUT DUE TO THE ELECTRICAL ISSUE.    DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THIS PART IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER, WHICH LEADS ME TO QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A LARGER, UNREPORTED ISSUE WITH THIS PART.  IF THERE IS NOT A DEMAND FOR IT, WHY IS IT ON BACK ORDER, AND IF THERE IS A DEMAND, PERHAPS THERE IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT CHRYSLER/JEEP IS NOT REPORTING.      CHRYSLER IS CLAIMING THAT THIS SWITCH IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR",

I DROVE IT TO MINNESOTA WHERE I LIVE AND DO NOT DRIVE IT MUCH AT ALL.  I HAVE PUT AROUND 4900 MILES ON IT SINCE THEN AND AT BEST BUY PUTTING IN NEW HEADLIGHTS THEY TOLD ME MY FRONT TIRES TREAD WAS SEPARATING.  I ALREADY HAD A APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED THE NEXT DAY TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP FIX THE LEAK IN MY ROOF FOR THE SECOND TIME.  THE INSIDE TREAD ON BOTH OF MY FRONT TIRES WAS REALLY BAD AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID I SHOULD NOT DRIVE IT TILL IT GETS NEW TIRES.  I WAS AT A DEALERSHIP ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE (FIXING LEAK) AND THEY DIDN'T MENTION IT AT ALL.  IF THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T NOTICE IT HOW WOULD I? BEST BUY NOTICED IT AND THEY DON'T EVEN FIX JEEP SRT8S, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF IT BLEW ON THE HIGHWAY?  I AM NOT A HEAVY FOOT DRIVER, IT DRIVES PERFECTLY AND I HAVE NEVER HIT ANYTHING WITH THE CAR.  LOOKING ONLINE IT SEEMS THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH EVERYONE WHO HAS A SRT8 SUV.  I HAVE ALSO HAD MY AC UNIT REPLACED, AND TAILLIGHT REWIRED, AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE,ESP BAS LIGHT IN DASH FIXED.  WHEN BRINGING IT TO THE DEALER TO GET IT FIXED, IT SEEMS LIKE ITS THE FIRST ONE THEY HAVE EVER SEEN, AND JUST ASSUME THAT ITS MY DRIVING THAT CAUSES THIS.  I HAVE ONLY SEEN 2 OTHER JEEP SRT8 IN REAL LIFE AND MOST SHOP PEOPLE I TALK TO HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE DRIVING LET ALONE WORKED ON ONE AND KNOWS THE PROBLEMS WITH IT.  THE DEALERSHIP BLAMES THE ALIGNMENT CAUSED IT SINCE THE BALL BEARINGS WERE FINE TO THEM.THE REAR TIRES ARE FINE ON THE VEHICLE JUST THE INSIDE OF THE FRONT AND CANT FIND ANYONE THAT CAN EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS.  I PAID 586 DOLLARS TO GET 2 OF THE SAME FACTORY TIRES WITH ALIGNMENT. I DO NOT FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR NEW TIRES AND THE ALIGNMENT FOR IT.  I THINK GOODYEAR AND JEEP NO THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES AND THEY ARE STILL MAKING US PAY FOR IT WHEN ITS THERE FAULT.   *TR",

THE ROADS WERE CLEAR AND FREE OF DEBRIS AND I SWERVED OFF THE ROAD AS I THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD THROWN A ROCK OR A BALL AT MY WINDOW. I QUICKLY GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND NOTICED A GAPING HOLE THROUGH THE MIRROR BUT NO OTHER DAMAGE TO ANY OTHER PART OF THE VEHICLE. NO SCRATCHES WERE ON THE MIRROR OR THE CAR BUT THERE WAS A GREENLIQUID FROM INSIDE THE MIRROR LOOSELY SCATTERED IN SMALL SPOTS ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. IT WAS THE SAME GREEN LIQUID PRESENT IN GREATER AMOUNTS WITHIN THE MIRROR. IT WAS CLEAR THE MIRROR MALFUNCTIONED AND IMPLODED. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I GOT THE VEHICLE AND CHRYSLER CORPORATE HEADQUARTERED AND THEY SAID SUCH A DEFECT WOULD NOT BE COVERED. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS INJURY AS I RAN OFF THE ROAD I HEARD THE BANG AND MIRROR EXPLODED. I THEN CONTACTED MY LOCAL BODY SHOP AND THE OWNER CONFIRMED HE HAS SEEN FAULTY WIRING AND EXPLODING MIRRORS FOR POWER HEATED MIRRORS. *TR",
