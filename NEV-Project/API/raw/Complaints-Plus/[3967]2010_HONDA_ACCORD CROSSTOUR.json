You see the mechanic at Jiffy Lube referred me to this recall due to his analysis and diagnosis being the same.

IT AGAIN HAPPENED AFTER A MONTH AND HE AGAIN FILLED IN OIL BUT HE CHARGED ME THIS TIME FOR FILLING THE OIL. HE SAID THAT WE WILL NEED TO DO \"OIL CONSUMPTION\" TEST AS HE DOESN'T SEE ANY LEAKAGE EITHER. THIS IS REALLY SCARY TO ME WHEN I SEE THAT THERE IS ALREADY CLASS SUIT AGAINST HONDA FOR THE SAME REASON BUT THAT'S APPLICABLE FOR 6 CYLINDERS ENGINE AND NOT FOR 4 CYLINDERS. WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER ABOUT IT, HE SIMPLY DENIED ANY LAWSUIT OR CLASS ACTION OR RECALL FOR ACCORD 2010. IT'S DEFECT IN A CAR BUT NEITHER HONDA ACCEPT IT OR DEALER AGREES TO IT. HOWEVER, I'M SPENDING MY MONEY AND TIME TO FILL IN THE OIL EVERY MONTH AFTER ONLY 1000 MILES. IT'S RIDICULOUS AND FRUSTRATING AS WELL.",

I ASKED IF IT WAS RELATED TO THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT,  BOTH STATED THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND \"WHY OIL WOULD BE IN THE CONVERTERS\". I HAVE USED THE DEALERSHIPS SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL WORK MINUS THE ALTERNATOR (2 WEEKS AGO). A NEW SHORTBLOCK WAS INSTALLED 20K MILES AGO (PART OF THE MISFIRE/OIL ISSUE). MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE SITUATION OF LOSING POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF ACCELERATION. I WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY TODAY (AND I DID NOT HAVE A SOLID YELLOW LINE WHEN I WAS PASSING - PRETTY MUCH A STRAIGHT AWAY).  I TOLD HONDA AMERICA THEY NEEDED TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ISSUES WITH THE 2010 HONDA ACCORD V6 GOES BEYOND MISFIRE AND OIL CONSUMPTION. I ATTEMPTED TO GOOGLE ACCIDENTS AND ISSUES WITH 2010 HONDA ACCORDS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE (POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR ACCIDENTS INVOLVING 2010 HONDA ACCORD V6 MODELS).  *TR",

I'VE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE MY BRAKES ON MY PREVIOUS CARS W/ MILEAGE UNDER 55,000.   I STARTED MY RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AFTERWARDS & FOUND THE 2010 HONDA CLASS-ACTION LAW SUIT REGARDING THE REAR BRAKES ON SPECIFIC YRS OF THE HONDA ACCORD.   HONDA WAS NOT REQUIRED TO ISSUE A RECALL ON THE REAR BRAKES. HONDA ACCORD BRAKE PADS SHOULD LAST UP TO 70,000 MILES.

MARCH 12, 2013 PAD REPLACEMENT. THE INBOARD PADS ON BOTH SIDES ARE WORN DOWN FAR MORE THAN THE OUTBOARD PADS.   ALSO, THE INBOARD PADS ARE WORN UNEVENLY: ONE OF THE INBOARD PADS HAS 2 MM LEFT ON THE END NEAR THE BREAK PAD WEAR INDICATOR & 3 MM LEFT ON THE OTHER END, THE OTHER INBOARD PAD HAS 1 MM LEFT ON THE END NEAR THE BREAK PAD WEAR INDICATOR & 2 MM OF PAD LEFT ON THE OTHER END. THE OUTBOARD PADS ARE WORN EVENLY AND BOTH HAVE 5-6 MM OF PAD REMAINING.    4. THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT! BOTH INBOARD AND OUTBOARD SHOULD WEAR EVENLY AND AT THE SAME RATE AND GIVE MORE THAN 31,000  36,000 MILES OF USEFUL SERVICE.     5. I BELIEVE THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE CALIPER AND/OR THE CALIPER MECHANISM AND THE EMBEDDED PARKING BRAKE MECHANISM.  PERHAPS THE DESIGN OF THE PARKING BRAKE MECHANISM SOMETIMES ALLOWS IT TO NOT RELEASE PROPERLY?  MY FEAR IS THAT THIS DESIGN FLAW WILL CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO MALFUNCTION WHILE DRIVING.    6.

I KNOW THE CONDENSER HAS TO BE EXPOSED BUT I BELIEVE THE MODEL OF THIS VEHICLE EXPOSES THE CONDENSER TOO MUCH AND IF ITS THAT SIMPLE FOR THE CONDENSER TO GET DAMAGED THEN HONDA HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW AND TO HAVE SUCH A NECESSARY REPAIR RUNNING FOR $900 AT 30,000 MILES IS RIDICULOUS. EITHER PUT BETTER CONDENSER ON HONDA VEHICLES OR DON'T PUT VEHICLES OUT THERE WHERE ONE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT HITTING PEBBLES BECAUSE THEY MIGHT COST YOU ANOTHER $900! REALLY UNHAPPY WITH HONDA RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT I LOVE HONDA'S AND MOST OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE ONE. HOPEFULLY HONDA CAN FIX THIS, BRAND NEW CAR AND ALREADY UNHAPPY AT 30,000!

THIS PROBLEM HAS BECOME SO BAD THAT I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT PAST 1 HOUR ON THE ROAD; IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHY IS THIS SO? BECAUSE THE DRIVER'S LUMBAR IS IMPROPERLY DESIGNED. ...MY STATEMENT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE OF PERSONALLY HAVING SEVERAL VEHICLES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS IN ADDITION TO DRIVING RENTAL VEHICLES ON A VERY FREQUENT BASIS (I TYPICALLY PLACE MORE MILES ON RENTAL VEHICLES THAN MY PERSONAL VEHICLES) ' AND I REALLY DO ENJOY DRIVING VEHICLES ON LONG TRIPS    WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE I LITERALLY GET A 'PAIN IN THE BACK'. I HAVE MADE MULTIPLE SEAT ADJUSTMENTS WITH NO SUCCESS. THE LUMBAR AREA BECOMES VERY PAINFUL WHERE IT FORCES ME TO GET OFF THE ROAD TO REST THE BACK. IF I DO NOT DO THIS I BECOME IRRITABLE (DOESN'T GO OVER WELL WITH MY SPOUSE OR THE FAMILY) AND STARTS IMPACTING MY DRIVING ABILITY. I HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO WEAR A FLEXIBLE BACK BRACE THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMFORT, BUT THAT ONLY LASTED ANOTHER HOUR PRIOR TO THE 'PAIN IN THE BACK' RETURNING. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE (& I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED OR RENTED) I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO MY WIFE (IT IS HER VEHICLE) THAT I WILL NO LONGER DRIVE THE ACCORD EX-L EXCEPT ON SHORT TRIPS (LESS THAN 60 MINUTES). THE PHYSICAL PAIN (LEGS, BACK, HIP, ETC.) THE SEAT CAUSES IS UNACCEPTABLE AND NEEDS RESOLVED PRIOR TO MY GIVING IT ANOTHER CHANCE.     I HAVE DONE SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH SINCE THE PURCHASE LOOKING FOR FIXES, ETC. INCLUDING INQUIRING WITH DEALERSHIP AND SPEAKING WITH HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO ASSISTANCE. THE LAST RESULT FROM THE DEALERSHIP WAS THAT THE ENGINEER DID ALSO EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM, BUT COULD NOT PROCEED FURTHER AS HONDA DID NOT HAVE A 'TECH NOTE' ON THE PROBLEM.

THIS COULD HAVE ULTIMATELY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AND HARMED HER AND OTHER PEOPLE.     AFTER HAVING OUR CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT A RODENT OF SOME TYPE HAD CHEWED ON THE CABLES. NOT ONLY DID THIS MAKE THE CAR UNSTABLE TO DRIVE ON THE ROAD, BUT THERE WAS A THREAT OF ELECTRICAL FIRE BECAUSE THE WIRE'S INSULATION WAS CHEWED AWAY BY A SMALL ANIMAL THAT WAS ATTRACTED TO THE SOY-BASED FOOD SOURCE IN THE WIRES. ADDING THE SOY TO THE WIRES CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS INCLUDING UNRELIABILITY, FIRES, AND POSSIBLY EVEN DEATH.     I DON'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. AUTOMOBILE MAKERS ARE USING THE SOY MATERIAL BECAUSE IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THEM. OVERALL, IT COSTS CONSUMERS/INSURANCE COMPANIES MUCH MORE WHEN REPAIRS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.

I DROVE THE CAR HOME FROM THE DEALER IN THE AFTERNOON ON 2/1/2010 AND I BEGAN TO NOTICE A RATTLING NOISE COMING FROM THE HOOD ON DRIVER SIDE.  I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER ON TUESDAY MORNING WHERE A MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT THE NOISE MAYBE COMING FROM THE DEFECTIVE HOUSING UNIT OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPER.  THE MECHANIC ORDERED THE NEW PART BUT IT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL NEXT WEEK.  THE NOISE HAS BEEN PERSISTENT AND GETTING STRONGER/LOUDER WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKE AND WHEN THE CAR IS IDLING AT INTERSECTION.  THE STEERING WHEEL ALSO APPEARED TO SHAKE WHENEVER THIS LOUD RATTLING NOISE CAME OUT.  I AM AFRAID THAT THIS PROBLEM MAYBE MORE THAT JUST A DEFECTIVE HOUSING PART OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPER, HENCE I AM REPORTING THIS TO ASSURE THAT ELECTRICAL PROBLEM OR BRAKES PROBLEM ARE NOT THE ISSUE FOR HONDA (IN LIEU OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH TOYOTA CARS AT THE PRESENT TIME).
