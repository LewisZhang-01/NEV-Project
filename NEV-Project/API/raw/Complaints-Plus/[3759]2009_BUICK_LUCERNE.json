AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS THEY FOUND THAT THE FUSE BLOCK UNDER THE REAR SEAT WAS BURNED UP AT THE FUEL PUMP FUSE, AN WAS ON FIRE AT ONE TIME.. THE FUSE BLOCK WAS BEYOND FIXING AN NEEDED  A NEW ONE  INSTALLED.  THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE IGNITION SWITCH, BUT THIS ISN'T WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE CARS,  I DON' BELIEVE THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH ON THERE RECALL ARE WHAT IS WRONG, I BELIEVE THAT THE FUSE BLOCK  IS WHAT  WRONG WITH THERE RECALLS WHEN THE FUSE SHORTS OUT THE FUEL  PUMP STOPS AN SO DOES THE CAR MOTOR. STRANGE THAT THE CAR DEALERS FOR SOME REASON HAS THEM IN STOCK,  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL CAR WITH THIS TYPE OF FUSE BOX,  THIS IS WHAT  CAUSING THESE CAR TO STOP RUNNING AN GET IN A ACCIDENTS.
