NO MATTER WHAT GEAR IT IS SHUT DOWN IN ,OTHER THAN PARK, THE VEHICLE ROLLS FREELY.  I HAD THOUGHT IT HAPPENED ONLY IF SHUT DOWN IN NEUTRAL, BUT IT IS ALL OTHER THAN PARK.    THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST REALIZED IN A PARKING LOT, AND REPEATED THIS A FEW MINUTES AGO IN MY DRIVEWAY.    I HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THE CAUSE MAY BE AND I REALIZE THAT THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER SHOULD BE PLACED IN PARK BEFORE SHUTTING THE CAR OFF.    I DO THINK THOUGH ,THAT IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE START/STOP BUTTON.  I THINK THAT WITH A KEY START THIS MAY NOT OCCUR.    I ALSO THINK THOUGH, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING DONE TO PREVENT ITS HAPPENING WHEN THE LEVER IS NOT PUT INTO PARK BEFORE SHUTOFF. A KEY CONTROLLED START/STOP   MIGHT'VE PREVENTED THIS. (??)",
