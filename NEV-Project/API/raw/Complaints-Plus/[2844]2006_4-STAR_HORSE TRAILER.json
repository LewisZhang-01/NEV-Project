THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AT A GM DEALERSHIP.   IT APPEARED THAT THE FIRE BEGAN WITH THE LDM MODULE FOR RUNNING THE LOW-BEAM AND DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS AS THIS WAS BURNED THROUGH THE EXTERIOR OF THE MODULE AND SPREAD WITHIN THE BOX.   THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND I MADE CONTACT WITH BUICK ON THE ISSUE BUT AFTER INITIALLY SEEMING LIKE THEY WANTED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE ROOT-CAUSE OF THE ISSUE DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOR PURSUE ANY FURTHER.   THE GM DEALER REPAIRED WITH COSTS OF APPROX. $2500.   THEY ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LISTED FROM GM ABOUT THIS ISSUE.   SEEMS THAT THERE ARE ISSUES WITHIN EITHER THIS MODULE OR THE LOW BEAMS.   THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BURNED ENTIRELY BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF THE CALL MADE TO PUT OUT THE ELECTRICAL FIRE IN THE FUSE PANEL.   *TR",
