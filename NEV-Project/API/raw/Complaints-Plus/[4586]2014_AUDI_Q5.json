Luckily , I parked the car to go into store and when I came out DSC red warning light came on , could not budge the steering wheel. Looked up issue in manual and said do not drive. I am from CT so no car now in NH. I had vehicle towed to closest Audi dealer , 60 miles away for service. It turns out to be I need a whole new steering column due to cold temperatures. If this happened while driving it would have been devastating. My issue is there was a recall on the 2014 SQ5 for the exact same issue. I have found numerous complaints for the same issue for the same vehicle, why has there not been recall?  This could have ben a deadly incident in the wrong situation.

The dealership, Gwinnett Audi, 3190 Satellite Blvd, Duluth, GA 30090,  said that Audi is paying for the oil top off for all customers.  Seems odd that if this is normal that Audi would voluntarily reimburse the dealership for this expense.  I am concerned, based on internet searches, that this will continue to get worse and I will be adding more and more oil without getting the problem resolved.  The dealership told me it would cost $7,000 to fix the engine and there is no longer a warranty.  This vehicle should not be burning oil at $80,000 miles.

My wife was driving the Audi Q5 at approximately 75mph and 125 miles west of Phoenix (near the CA/AZ border) when the car suddenly loss power. She stepped on the gas and noticed the speed gradually dropping. Fortunately, she had the presence of mind and barely had enough time to pull over to the shoulder. It was at this point that she called to tell me that the car would no longer start and the \u201ccheck engine\u201d and \u201cEPC\u201d light indicators were illuminated. This occurred at approximately 12:30 noon during a severe heatwave where the outside temperature was 117 degrees. I asked her to wait for 10 minutes to try to restart the car; the car would not restart.  She called AAA Towing and was told the wait would be over one hour because of the rural location (Quartzsite, AZ). She ended up waiting a little over 3 hours in her car, without air conditioning, in 117 degrees for a tow truck driver to arrive. The car was towed to her sister\u2019s house in Goodyear, AZ at a cost of $673.  The next day, she had the car towed to the Audi Dealership in Peoria, AZ where it was diagnosed the car had suffered a fuel vapor lock due to the heat. The car has less than 28,000 miles on the odometer when the incident happened. Audi Peoria kept the car for a couple of days because the parts had to be ordered from Los Angeles. Ultimately, the repair bill from the dealership came to $1,983.  I felt helpless and scared for my wife that I was not able to assist her as I was 3 hours away. What if my wife (or another driver) was unable to pull over to the side of the road? The chances of an accident are dramatically increased if the vehicle was stuck on the highway. As you can imagine, my wife has been traumatized by this incident and we are both fearful that this incident can happen again. Therefore, we request that NHTSA investigate this incident.",

WOKE UP IN THE MORNING TO A GARAGE THAT SMELLED VERY HEAVILY LIKE GAS. LOOKED BELOW THE AUDI Q5 AND SAW A SMALL PUDDLE OF GAS. PARKED THE CAR OUTSIDE THE GARAGE AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY ADVISED THAT THIS COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD AND ASKED TO CALL AUDI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FOR A TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP. AUDI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ASKED ME TO CALL THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT A FIRE HAZARD. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED AFTER THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT. MADE SURE THIS IS NOT A FIRE HAZARD WHILE BEING TOWED. THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME TODAY (MONDAY THE 16TH OF JULY 2014) TO TELL ME THAT THE GAS TANK WAS HIT BY SOME ROAD DEBRIS AND ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE SOME SCRATCHES IN THE FUEL TANK AND WAS NOT SURE WHY THE LEAK IS OCCURRING. EVEN THOUGH THE BRAND NEW Q5 IS JUST 2 WEEKS OLD, THE REPAIRS WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND ITS APPROX. $5,000 TO FIX THE ISSUE. I HAVE CALLED AUDI CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAITING TO HEAR FROM THEM AT THIS TIME. I'M ALSO FILING THE COMPLAINT HERE SINCE THIS ISSUE SEEMS LIKE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN. HOW COULD A LEISURELY UNEVENTFUL DRIVE IN A BRAND NEW SUV ON THE FREEWAY LEAD TO THE FUEL TANK BEING RUPTURED OR CRACKED FROM ROAD DEBRIS!  THIS JUST DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT. SINCE IT WAS PARKED OVERNIGHT IN A CLOSED GARAGE I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE ISSUE. I'M WORRIED THAT THERE MAY BE OTHERS PARKED IN THE ROAD THAT MAY NOT FIND THE ISSUE AND COULD CAUSE A FIRE WHILE ON THE MOVE OR IT COULD BURN DOWN THE HOUSE IF PARKED IN A CLOSED GARAGE FOR EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.   *TR",
