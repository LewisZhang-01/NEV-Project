        "summary": "THE ELECTRIC SLIDING DOOR ON THIS MINIVAN IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR TWO REASONS.  THE FIRST IS THAT IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF RESISTANCE BEFORE THE DOOR WILL REVERSE WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS AN OBJECT.  THAT OBJECT, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS BEEN A CHILD GETTING IN OR OUT OF THE CAR.  THIS HAS CAUSED SEVERAL BRUISES, BUT THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT A SMALLER CHILD WOULD BE CRUSHED, OR THE NECK OR LIMB OF A LARGER CHILD WOULD BE EASILY BROKEN.  I AM AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND CAN ATTEST TO THIS FACT.  THE SECOND DANGER POINT IS THAT THE DOOR OPERATES FROM A KEYCHAIN REMOTE.  IF THE REMOTE IS BUMPED, DROPPED, OR LIGHTLY PRESSED (AS WHEN IN A POCKET), THE DOOR WILL EITHER OPEN OR CLOSE.  THIS OFTEN OCCURS WHEN CHILDREN OR OTHER PASSENGERS ARE IN THE DOORWAY, AND HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN SEVERAL CRUSH INJURIES.  THIS IS A DEADLY COMBINATION OF DESIGN FLAWS (I.E. A HAIR-TRIGGER ON A GUILLOTINE) THAT MOST ASSUREDLY WILL CAUSE A DISASTER.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER AND WITH THEIR NATIONAL OFFICE, AND THEY BOTH TOLD ME THAT \"THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER COMPLAINT SO I MUST BE WORRYING ABOUT NOTHING.\"  THE DEALER, HOWEVER, WAS SURPRISED WHEN I DEMONSTRATED HOW MUCH FORCE WAS REQUIRED TO REVERSE THE DOOR.  THIS PROBLEM MUST BE INVESTIGATED.  IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE DEACTIVATED THIS DANGEROUS HAZARD.  *AK",
