ANYWAY THE CODE SAYS, RANDOM MISS FIRING, WHICH RESULTS IN A VERY LEAN UNBURNED MIXTURE OF FUEL, WITH MANY OWNERS HAVING THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND/OR 02 SENSORS GET BURNT OUT AS A RESULT. WHEN THIS OCCURS THE ENGINE RUNS VERY VERY ROUGH, AND COULD STALL. IF THIS HAPPENS IN THE WRONG SITUATION, LIKE ON THE FREEWAY, IT COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT OR EVEN DEATH. MAZDA KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND HAS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN OUT ON IT, BUT IT IS AROUND A $300 PART (DEALER) AND VERY NEAR THAT EVERYWHERE ELSE (I.E. AUTOZONE $260) AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS. IMO SINCE THIS CONDITION CAN AND WILL RUIN THE POLLUTION SYSTEM, THEY OUGHT TO ISSUE A RECALL, AND REFUND ANY MONEY ALREADY SPENT ON THE NEW COIL PACK FOR THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD IT CHANGED.   *TR",
