I rolled 3 or 4 times and finally landed right side up. My roof was caved in and resting on the top of my head, shoulder and neck. However, none of my airbags deployed ( see pictures), even though I hit the irrigation ditch head-on. Vehicle can be inspected if needed.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FORD COMPANY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE VEHICLE WAS ABLE TO BE REPAIRED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT OVER 36,000 MILES AND THREE (3) YEARS HAS ELAPSED. I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AMACO CO. TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WITH MY PERSONAL EXPENSES AT $2,000.00. THEY PROVIDED AT ONE (1) YEAR 12, 000 MILES WARRANTY. WITHIN TWO YEARS THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AGAIN AND I HAD TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER TRANSMISSION COMPANY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE A WARRANTY ANYMORE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A AUTO SHOP TO SERVICE THE TRANSMISSION AGAIN AND WAS GIVEN AFTER THE REPAIR AN ONE (1) YEAR WARRANTY AT 12,000 MILES. THREE YEARS LATER THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AGAIN IN 2014 AND NOW I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE REPAIR FOR TRANSMISSION FAILURE. NOW AGAIN THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND GIVEN A ONE (1) YEAR WARRANTY AT 12, 000 MILES. NOW WE ARE IN 2015, THE TRANSMISSION IS REQUIRING REPAIR FOR THE FOURTH TIME. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN A LEMON FROM THE BEGINNING FIRST WITH THE FIRESTONE TIRES AND NOW WITH THE TRANSMISSION. I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPAIR THIS VEHICLE, IT IS AT 293,500 MILES. I HAVE CONTACTED FORD COMPANY SEVERAL TIMES TO NO RESOLUTION. FORD COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. THEY INDICATED THAT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY AND SAFETY MUST DEEM THE VEHICLE TO BE A LEMON, HAVE SUFFICENT CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND MOVE FORWARD TO HAVE A NATIONAL RECALL. BASED ON INTERNET FINDINGS THE YEAR 2000 TO 2004 OF FORD EXPLORE'S HAS HAD MANY ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION. FORD COMPANY HAS REFUSED TO PERFORM A \"GOODWILL\" GESTURE ON REPAIRING THIS LEMON.

MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS STRUT HAD BROKE AS IT WAS HANGING THERE BUT AFTER CLOSER INSPECTION THE LIFT GATE BALL MOUNT HAD SNAPPED OFF. THERE IS SURFACE RUST ON THE OUTER PART OF THE BALL MOUNT AND CLIP THAT KEEPS THE STRUT ON THE MOUNT BUT THE BALL MOUNT WHERE IT SNAPPED IS CLEAN.    THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FAILURE IS REAR LIFT GATE WILL NOT CLOSE PROPERLY AND BECAUSE IT CAN'T CLOSE THE INTERIOR LIGHTS STAY ON AND GET VERY HOT. I REMOVED THE FRONT LIGHT BUT COULDN'T GET THE TOP OFF OF THE REAR INTERIOR LIGHT SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY.    HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE WITH MANY EXPLORERS. PROBLEM IS NO PART CAN BE PURCHASED AS THIS MOUNT IS WELDED ONTO THE BODY AT THE FACTORY. TWO SOLUTIONS ARE THAT FORD FIXES IT AT A COST TO THE CONSUMER OR THE CONSUMER JURY RIGS IT WITH DRILLING OUT HOLES IN THE STRUT AND FASHIONING A MEANS OF ATTACHMENT USING BOLTS AND SCREWS THAT CAN AND DO LOOSEN UP AND NEED TO BE TIGHTENED FREQUENTLY.

I CONTACTED FORD FOR ANY RECALLS ON FRAMES SPLITTING. I WAS INFORMED BY E-MAIL AND PERSONAL TELEPHONE CALL THAT THIS IS VERY UNHEARD OF AND I SHOULD BRING THE CAR TO A FORD DEALER FOR SERVICE. IT IS NOW THREE WEEKS AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY CAR OR THE REASON WHY THE FRAME SPLIT UNDER NORMAL DRIVING.

THEY CROSS OVER EACH OTHER AND DUE TO OBVIOUS VERTICAL SUSPENSION TRAVEL THEY WERE CHAFFING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARED ONE WAS ALSO CHAFFING AGAINST THE FRAME SOMEWHAT (THE LATTER I'M GUESSING OCCURS ONLY WHEN CARRYING A HEAVY LOAD).  THE CHAFFING WAS SO BAD THAT IT HAD RUBBED ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE ACTUAL LEFT CABLE (APROX 50% OF THE CABLE DIAMETER)ALLOWING WATER ETC... KICKED UP BY THE WHEEL TO PENETRATE AND SEVERELY CORRODE THE CABLE.  SOON AFTER I HAD REMOVED THE WHEEL, THE CABLE SNAPPED IN TWO DUE TO THE SUSPENSION BEING UNLOADED AND THE SEVERE CORROSION OF THE CABLE.  I AM CURIOUS IF THERE IS ALREADY A RECALL ON THIS OR IF YOU HAVE HAD OTHER REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON OTHER EXPLORERS.  UNLESS MY VEHICLE IS MISSING CLAMPS ETC... THIS APPEARS TO BE A BAD DESIGN TO HAVE THE TWO CABLES TOUCHING  THE WAY THEY DO.  I HAVE TAKEN MULTIPLE DIGITAL PICTURES WITH THE SUSPENSION UNLOADED AND WITH THE VEHICLE BACK ON THE GROUND AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEND THEM TO YOU.  THIS IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE IF THE E-BRAKE WERE TO BE USED AT A DECENT RATE OF SPEED, ONE WHEEL BRAKING ACTION COULD OBVIUOSLY CAUSE A LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, NOT TO MENTION THE VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY DUE TO LOSS OF PARKING BRAKE ACTION.  THE PARTS (CABLES) ARE AVAILAIBE AS THEY ARE STILL INSTALLED ON THE VEHICLE AT THIS TIME.  PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH ANY INFO YOU HAVE.  THANKS,*AK",

I CALLED ON 23 MAR TO CHECK AND WAS TOLD BOTH CYLINDER HEADS WERE CRACKED AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE ENGINE MAY HAVE TO BE REPLACED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR AN ADJUSTER FROM FORD TO MAKE A DETERMINATION TO SEE IF THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR JUST THE CYLINDER HEADS. IT IS NOW THE AFTERNOON OF 29 MAR AND I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THE CYLINDER HEADS ARE ON BACK ORDER AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN MY CAR WILL BE READY. I CALLED FORD (800-392-3673) AND BASICALLY WAS TOLD SORRY NOTHING WE CAN DO THE CYLINDER HEADS ARE ON \"NATIONAL BACK ORDER\".

I FOUND THAT IF I FULLY DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR THE TRUCK WOULD START BUT WOULD STALL RIGHT AFTER. IF I HELD THE GAS DOWN A LITTLE AFTER STARTING, THE TRUCK WOULD RUN BUT STALL IF I LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL FULLY.  THIS PROBLEM HAS PLAGUED US FOR 2 YEARS AND THE DEALER HAS LOOKED AT IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT FOUND NOTHING. I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM MYSELF AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON A FORD TRUCK OWNER WEB SITE. THE PROBLEM WAS A FAULTY IAC VALVE. I KNOW THIS FOR SURE BECAUSE THE TRUCK REPEATED THE PROBLEM AND WOULDN'T IDLE UNTIL I REPLACED THIS VALVE. AFTER THAT THE TRUCK STARTED RIGHT UP.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND REPORTED THE RESULTS. THEY CLAIMED THEY CAN'T REIMBURSE ME FOR THAT PART COST (~ $80) BECAUSE THEY NEVER COULD GET AN ERROR CODE FROM THE DIAGNOSTICS THEY RAN. IF THEY REFUNDED MY COST, FORD WOULD CHARGE THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE PART (FORD'S POLICY ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP).  MY ISSUE IS WHEN I BOUGHT THE PART, THE PERSON BEHIND THE COUNTER SAID THEY STOCK AT LEAST 6 OF THESE DEVICES BECAUSE THEY GO THROUGH THEM LIKE WATER. IF THAT'S THE CASE, MY DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE REPLACED OURS TO START WITH AND MY REPAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD TWO YEARS OF WORRY-FREE OWNERSHIP. FORD SHOULD STEP UP AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PROBLEMATIC PART.  *JB",

WHEN THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN QUOTED \u001cIT\u0019S A DESIGN FLAW; YOU HAVE AIR IN THE RACK & PINION STEERING\u001d. THE AIR APPARENTLY ENTERS THROUGH THE HOUSING SEALS WHEN THE TRUCK WAS BEING SERVICED AFTER A FAN BELT TENSIONER RUPTURED AND THE TRUCK HAD TO BE MANUALLY STEERED. THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THE AIR FROM THE HOUSING WAS TO RUN THE VEHICLE FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME UNTIL THE AIR CIRCULATES WITH THE POWER STEERING FLUID THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND ESCAPES AT THE RESERVOIR.     THIS \u001cDESIGN FLAW\u001d KNOWN BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL. NOT ONLY DO MY WIFE AND I FEAR FOR OUR LIVES NOW WHEN WE DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, BUT MY KIDS ARE TERRIFIED TO RIDE IN THE VEHICLE AS WELL. WE RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PRE-CERTIFIED FORD EXPLORER IN FEBRUARY OF 2003 AT PARKWAY EAST FORD IN PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA.     I TRULY BELIEVE WITH MY YEARS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BACKGROUND THAT THIS KNOWN \u001cDESIGN FLAW\u001d MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RECENT ROLL-OVER FATALITIES OF THE FORD EXPLORER IN CERTAIN CASES.

IF IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOR ME BEING CONCERNED ABOUT US FALLING TO THE BACKSEAT SOMEDAY DUE TO THEIR LOOSENESS, A SEVERE INJURY COULD MAYBE HAVE OCCURRED JUST LIKE ONES FILED IN THE COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE ON FILE..  I GOT THE SITUATION REPAIRED (COSTING ME $77.13).  THE SERVIE DEPARTMENT EVEN GAVE ME THE BOLTS TO SHOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED ALSO AND MAYBE I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR REPAIRING THIS BEFORE A SEVER INJURY DID OCCUR.  *AK",

I HAVE PERSONALLY STOPPED AND TOLD MANY OF THOSE DRIVERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING REAR-ENDED DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND THEM NOT BEING ALERTED TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SLOWING/STOPPING.

IT HAS SINCE HAPPENED 4 MORE TIMES ALL GOING DOWN HILLS. IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP 5 TIMES BUT ONLY WORKED ON 2 OF THE 5 TIMES BECAUSE FORD MOTOR CO. DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO FIX. THEY ALSO SAID IT HAD TO SHUT OFF ON A MECHANIC TO DO ANYTHING . OVERALL THE HAD OUR VEHICLE 23 DAYS  , IT DIDN'T SHUT OFF. THEY INSTALLED A FLIGHT INDICATOR ON OUR VEHICLE AND RETURNED IT TO US AND TOLD US TO PUSH THE BUTTON WITHIN 5 SECONDS WHEN IT SHUTS OFF. YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS WITH 2 PEOPLE IN THE CAR. IT SHUT OFF FEB.2,01  I PUSHED THE BUTTON BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AND RETURNED IT 3 HOURS LATER AND SAID WE GOT A GOOD READING THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. FORD MOTOR CO. ASKED FOR THE READING AND SAID IT WASN'T A GOOD READING DON'T DO ANYTHING .

OVERALL SAFETY ON AMERICA'S ROADS HAS INCREASED OVER THE LAST DECADE. HOWEVER, SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (SUVS) THREATEN TO REVERSE THE TREND. THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT SUVS ARE NOT AS SAFE AS THEY APPEAR. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT SUVS POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS OF OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SAFETY PROBLEMS THREATEN PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS OF SUVS THEMSELVES. MOST DRIVERS WANT TO FEEL SAFE ON THE ROAD, BUT CHOOSING AN SUV FOR SAFETY MAY BE MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE. PARTLY, IT'S AN ISSUE OF ESCALATION. LIKE AN ARMS RACE, AS MORE DRIVERS CHOOSE HEAVIER CARS, THOSE WHO CHOOSE LIGHTER CARS ARE IN MORE DANGER. THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY STUDYING THE SAFETY OF SUVS, DESCRIBES TWO CHARACTERISTICS OF SUVS AND OTHER LIGHT TRUCKS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE FATALITIES: ROLLOVER PROPENSITY AND CRASH COMPATIBILITY.(1) ROLLOVER AND UNSAFE FEATURES THE PROPENSITY OF SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES TO ROLL OVER IS MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN. SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ROLL OVER IN CRASH THAN NORMAL PASSENGER CARS. THE HIGHER ROLL-OVER PROPENSITY MAY ALSO LEAD TO HIGHER FATALITIES. SUVS ARE HEAVIER AND RIDE HIGHER THAN REGULAR CARS. THE HIGH RIDE CONTRIBUTES TO A PROPENSITY OF SUVS TO ROLL OVER IN ACCIDENTS. ACCORDING TO NHTSA, SUVS ROLLOVER IN 37 PERCENT OF FATAL CRASHES, COMPARED TO A 15 PERCENT ROLLOVER RATE FOR PASSENGER CARS. ROLLOVER CRASHES ACCOUNTED FOR 53 PERCENT OF ALL SUV OCCUPANT DEATHS IN SINGLE VEHICLE CRASHES IN 1996.",

SO I AM UNABLE TO CONTACT THEM. ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE USA TODAY NEWSPAPER DATED 8/2/2000 IT REPORTS THAT 31 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THESE TIRES BURSTING.  IT REPORTS THAT IN 6  OTHER COUNTRIES FORD MOTOR CO RECALLED THE TIRES. I NEED ASSISTANCE IMEDIATELY AS I AM AFRAID TO USE MY VEHICLE. I CAN NOT TAKE THE  CHANCE OF HAVING MY GRAD KIDS KILLED BY  FAULTY TIRES. I AM ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING MY MOTHER EACH DAY FOR RADIATION 50 MILES AWAY. I NEED MY VEHICLE IMEDIATELY.  I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THESE TIRES. DOES FORD MOTOR CO  CARE MORE ABOUT CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAN AMERICAN CITIZENS???

A CHILD WAS INJURED BY THE UPPER HINGE OF THE REAR DOOR WHILE ENTERING THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THE CHILD'S MOTHER  OPENED THE REAR DOOR AS THE CHILD CLIMED INTO THE VEHICLE.  EVIDENTLY THE CHILD WAS USING THE EXPOSED REAR DOOR HINGE AS A GRIP.  THE HINGE APPEARS TO BE THE SAME MODEL AS USED ON THE FORD RANGER PICKUP TRUCK.  THE \"STOP\" WHICH LIMITS THE DOOR'S MOVEMENT IS A PIECE OF METAL THAT EXTENDS PAST THE PIN ON THE HINGE.  THE \"STOP\" AND THE PORTION OF THE HINGE WHICH IS FASTENED TO THE FRAME HAVE THE SHAPE OF SCISSORS.  THERE IS NO BODY PANEL TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THE REAR DOOR'S HINGE FROM THE OPENING TO THE FRONT OF THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.  THE HINGE IF USED ON THE FRONT DOORS OF A VEHICLE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE.
