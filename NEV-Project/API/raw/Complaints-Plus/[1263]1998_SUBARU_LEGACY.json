I HAVE TO LIFT IT UP WITH MY FOOT. IF I HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME LIKE THIS, I EVENTUALLY LOSE THE ABILITY TO GET THE CAR IN AND OUT OF GEAR. I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND LET IT COOL OFF (FOR ABOUT AN HOUR) AND IT WILL FIX ITSELF. I HAVE HAD TO SIT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WITH MY KIDS IN THE CAR, WAITING FOR IT TO COOL DOWN! IT FIRST HAPPENED IN 1999. SUBARU TRIED TO FIX IT BY REPLACING MOST OF THE CLUTCH (THE PRESSURE PLATE, FLY WHEEL, SLAVE AND MASTER CYLINDER). THEY PRESSURE AND GRAVITY BLED THE SYSTEM. I WAS THERE ALMOST EVERY WEEK FOR MONTHS. THEY WOULD TRY ONE THING AND WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK, THEY WOULD REPLACE ANOTHER PART OR TRY SOMETHING ELSE. EVENTUALLY, WINTER SHOWED UP AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR A WHILE. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD FIXED THE PROBLEM. THEN SUMMER CAME AGAIN AND SO DID THE PROBLEM. I TOOK THE CAR BACK IN, BUT SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SUBARU REFUSED TO FIX IT UNLESS I PAID FOR IT. SUBARU HAS SINCE ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN (#03-52-03) REGARDING THIS ISSUE, BUT SUBARU REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM, STATING THERE ARE TOO MANY MILES ON MY CAR (77,000) AND IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY. I CONTEND, THEY NEVER FIXED THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT IT TOOK THEM FIVE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. I DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE ORIGINAL PARTS. SUBARU SAID THEY HAD TO KEEP THEM AS PART OF THEIR WARRANTY PLAN.",

I KNOW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL PREVIOUSLY ON THE SUBARU BRAND FILTER (1998) FOR THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, BUT I HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH A LEE BRAND FILTER, WHICH I HAD BUT ON 2100 MILES EARLIER.  UP UNTIL THIS TIME, NO LOSS OF OIL HAD OCCURRED WITH THIS FILTER OR WITH PREVIOUS OIL CHANGES (I HAD JUST CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL A FEW DAYS EARLIER).  I BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE A LARGER PROBLEM HERE, OTHER THAN THE SUBARU BRAND FILTER FROM THE RECALL.  YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN AUTO QUESTION AND ANSWER AREA IN THE FRIDAY JULY 23 ISSUE OF THE NEWSPAPER \"NEWSDAY\" (LONG ISLAND, NY  WWW.NEWSDAY.COM).  THE VERY FIRST QUESTION IS FROM AN OWNER OF A 1998 SUBARU LEGACY WHO HAD AN OIL LEAK ATTRIBUTED TO THE FILTER, AND HAD TO HAVE HIS CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER.  HE MENTIONED THAT THE DEALER REQUIRED HIM TO PAY FOR THE TOWING AND REPAIR, AS THE OIL FILTER THAT FAILED WAS NOT A SUBARU OIL FILTER.  SINCE THIS IS ANOTHER INCIDENT INVOLVING A NON SUBARU FILTER FAILURE.  THIS MAY INDICATE THAT OTHER BRAND FILTERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM, AND THAT THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR ITSELF, AND NOT THE FILTER.  THE CAR IS CURRENTLY PARKED, WAITING FOR ME TO GET OFF OF WORK TO PUT ON A NEW FILTER (FRAM BRAND).  I DID NOTICE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE FRAM FILTER IS MUCH TALLER THAN THE LEE BRAND FILTER GASKET.  I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAS ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROBLEM.  CAN YOU ADVISE ME IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS OF THIS TYPE FROM PEOPLE WHO EITHER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH A SUBARU FILTER NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL OR WITH A LEE MAXI FILTER OR OTHER NON SUBARU FILTER.
