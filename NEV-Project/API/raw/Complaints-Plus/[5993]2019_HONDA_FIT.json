While heading back to our home in Florida on July 11 2021, on Interstate 84 near Matamoras, PA, we started smelling burnt plastic. We pulled off the highway and noticed the burnt smell coming from under our hood. Upon opening the hood we could see the TBC+ smoldering. The result of this aftermarket component (TBC+) failing caused an under hood fire, which melted plastic components on the Honda Fit.  This TBC+ also shorted, resulting in sending excess voltage and current to the electrical components on the Honda fit. This resulted in our alternator failing. As it is a fire hazard, I would like all TBC+ modules manufactured by RVIBrake.com to be recalled and all owners of this module get compensated for any expenses resulting from this device.",

SAFETY ISSUE: Today while towing the Honda Fit behind our Thor Gemini on Interstate 84 in Pennsylvania, I smelled a strong order of burned plastic. When I pulled over to the nearest rest area to investigate, I noticed the smell was emanating from the hood of my Honda Fit.  I have pictures that show what I found when I opened the hood (Towed battery charger unit melted). Sadly, the fuse that is on this this device did not blow. Even worse, is my Honda Fit is now dead. I have no power to the car at all. The ignition, lights, horn, door alarms no longer work. If I hadn\u2019t pulled over when I did, I fear that the Towed Battery Charger Plus would have set my Honda Fit and Thor RV on fire.  Sent email to dealer/manufacture; RVIBrake. Also called their phone number and left a message. At this time dealer has not responded.  Part is available for inspection. Part has not yet been inspected by manufacturer, police or insurance company.  There was no warning lamp, message or other symptom of the problem.
