The first time the vehicle was pulling into my garage and the trunk opened without prompting. The trunk smashed against the top of the garage and the facade of my home. Lincoln reviewed the electrical system and determined the event occurred without my involvement and replaced the latch. They did not call it a recall issue but did agree that they have seen it occur more than a few times. Subsequently, the issue occurred again. I was pulling into an indoor garage at a mall,  and the trunk opened voluntarily once again. This time no damage occurred as I pulled to the side and remedied the situation. The third occurrence happened a few days ago as I dropped my 10 year old off at home. The trunk once again voluntarily opened. Each time i could've been driving at a faster speed and each time these incidences occurred I had parts of my family in the vehicle. There were never any warning lamps and the manufacturer has gone silent with what the issue is. I am concerned that this can occur at a higher rate of speed with all of my children in the car.",
