I checked the coolant noticed it was a little low, went to work and on my way home from work my car overheated;  again with no low coolant light or warning. I was smart enough to crank the heat in order to keep engine cool and by the time I got home, my car was chuckling.  I was worried I may have cracked the head.  I had to have the car towed ($150) and the water pump repair was ($2300).  In all my years of automotive, I've never heard of a water pump repair cost this much. Googling the part is roughly $380 but because its chain driven its an 11 hr repair. I have copies of the invoice and towing but not with me at the moment.",

The independent mechanic initially diagnosed the vehicle with a defective fuel pump. The fuel pump was replaced however, the failure recurred twice after the replacement. On the third failure, the modulator was replaced due to the modulator over heating the fuel pump. Upon investigation, the mechanic informed the contact of NHTSA Campaign Number: 16V621000 (Fuel System, Gasoline) however, the VIN was not included. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and confirmed that the VIN was not under recall. The vehicle was repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.",

SHORTLY THERE AFTER, THE OTHER REAR PASSENGER DOOR ON THE RIGHT SIDE BEGAN HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. CURRENTLY BOTH OF MY REAR DOORS CANNOT BE OPENED ELECTRONICALLY.

THIS HAS CREATED DIFFICULTY IN ME TRANSPORTING ANY PASSENGERS AND IS EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT TO PLACE ANYTHING IN THE BACK SEAT. THE INABILITY TO LOCK THE BLACK DOORS WITH THE KEY FOB OR ELECTRONIC SYSTEM IN THE CAR HAS RESULTED IN THE DOOR BEING LEFT UNLOCKED IF NOT THE LOCKING KNOB IS NOT PHYSICALLY PUSHED DOWN EVERY TIME.   I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR ON BOTH REAR DOORS BUT THAT IT HAD TO BE DONE AT A FORD DEALERSHIP. I CALLED FORD AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE DOORS WOULD NEED TO BE REPROGRAMMED AFTER INSTALLING THE DOOR LOCK ACTUATORS TO ENSURE THE DOORS ARE PROPERLY SYNCED TO THE ELECTRONICA SYSTEM OF THE CAR. THE COST OF THIS IS OVER OVER $500 PER DOOR AND I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.   I HAVE HAD PRIOR ISSUES WITH MY 2010 FORD TAURUS WHERE THE BACK DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN AND HAD TO PAY ABOUT $500 FOR A REAR DOOR ACTUATOR TO BE INSTALLED AND SYNCED. THE USABILITY OF THE DOORS DOES NOT CHANGE WHEN THE CAR IS OFF, ON, PARKED, OR IN MOTION.   MY PASSENGERS COULD POTENTIALLY BE AT RISK AND THE COST OF REPAIR MAKES THIS ISSUE CONTINUING.",
