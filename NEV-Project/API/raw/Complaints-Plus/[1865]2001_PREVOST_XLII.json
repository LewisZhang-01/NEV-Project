TIRE WAS REMOTELY MONITORED BY A TIRE PRESSURE SENSO WITH MONITORS PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE.    I FOUND THE INSIDE DUAL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLAT.  EXPECTING A LEAKING VALVE STEM EXTENSION I REPLACED SICH WITH A NEW ONE AND STARTED AIRING UP THE TIRE.  I HAVE ONLAY A SMALL SEARS 150 LB PANCAKE COMPRESSOR SO THIS WAS A SLOW PROCESS.  LIBERTY RECOMENDS RUNNING 95 LBS ON THE DRIVE AXLE.  AS I NEARED THAT PRRESSURE I STOPPED REGULARLY AND CHECKED PRESSURE FOR ACCURACY.  AT APPROX 93-95 LBS THE TIRE EXPLODED IN MY FACE.  WHAT I THINK SAVED MY LIFE WAS THE OUTSIDE DUAL.  I SUFFERED NO EYE TRAUMA BUT HAVE SUFFERED EAR TRAUMA AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SUNDRONE.  I HAVE BEEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TWICE AND NOW GOING TO A EAR NOE AND THROAT SPECIALIST FOR THE EAR PROBLEMS. I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS VISITS TO THE DR SINCE FOR REGULAR EXAMINATINS FROM THIS INCIDENT.  UPON THE EXPLOSION THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT AND SHERIFFS OFFICE DID RESPOND TO OUR HOME WHERER THE ACCIDENT OCCURED. I CAN ATTACH SUCH REPORTS IF NEEDED.  I DEEM THIS A VERY SERIOUS LIFE THREATENING SITUATION THAT IS COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE.  ANY HELP IN THIS MATTER WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND I DONT WANT TO SEE ANYONE GO THRU THIS TYPE OF AVOIDABLE TRAUMA.
