HAD THE ONCOMING CAR NOT BRAKED, SHE FEELS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT.  IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND NOT A CONVENIENCE ISSUE. I CONTACTED AUDI VIA E-MAIL TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THIS AND THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO BRING THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSIC AND ROAD TEST WHICH I DID. THE DEALER STATED THAT THE CAR IS \"OPERATING WITHIN MANUFACTURER'S SPECS'' AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. WHEN I FOLLOWED UP WITH AUDI THEY CONCURRED WITH THE DEALER AND AGAIN STATED THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. I LOGGED-ON TO AN AUDI ALLROAD FORUM(AUDIWORLD.COM) AND MANY OTHER ALLROAD OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS, AND GETTING THE SAME RESULTS WHEN THEY CONTACT AUDI, WHICH IS NO AKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.

THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DATE ABOUT THE TIRES PREMATURELY WEARING.  AT ABOUT 12600 MI THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR INDICATED A SUDDEN DECREASE IN PRESSURE FOR THE RR TIRE.  I WAS GOING ABOUT 15 MPH AND WAS NEAR A TIRE SHOP.   WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SHOP, THE TIRE WAS NEARLY FLAT.  THEY REPAIRED THE TIRE, BUT INFORMED ME THAT THREE OF THE FOUR TIRES WOULD NOT PASS SAFETY INSPECTION.  THE RIGHT FRONT AND RIGHT REAR HAVE NOT TREAD LEFT AND THE THE LR IS NEARLY GONE.  THE LF WOULD PASS BUT IS BADLY FEATHERED FOR ONLY 12600 MILES.  THE CAUSE OF THE FLAT TIRE WAS A NAIL I HAD PICKED UP IN THE NEARLY BALD RR TIRE.  THE SHOP SAID IF IT HAD HAPPENED AT FREEWAY SPEEDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS.  THEY STATED A NORMALLY TREADED TIRE WOULD NOT HAVE PICKED UP THE NAIL, BUT BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE WEAR, THE NAIL IMMEDIATLELY PUNCTURED THE TIRE.
