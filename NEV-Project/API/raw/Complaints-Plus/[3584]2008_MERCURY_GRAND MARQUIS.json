HOWEVER, MY CAR IS SO LOW MILEAGE FOR ITS AGE THAT I DECIDED I SHOULD HAVE THE CABLE CHECKED ANYHOW. THEN, I HEARD THAT MANY OF THE AFTERMARKET EMERGENCY CABLES ARE DEFECTIVE. THANKFULLY, MY SON, [XXX] , KNOWS SOMEONE WHO CAN CHECK THE CABLES. WE TESTED CABLES FROM TWO AUTO PARTS RETAIL STORES. ONE FAILED TO HOLD PRESSURE. THE OTHER CABLE EXPLODED RATHER DRAMATICALLY. FORTUNATELY, THE PEOPLE MY SON KNOWS MAKE EMERGENCY CABLES. FROM OUTWARD APPEARANCE, THE CABLE THEY MADE WAS DEFINITELY SUPERIOR. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THEY TESTED THE CABLE, IT HELD PRESSURE WITHOUT DROPPING AT ALL. MY SON ONCE PICKED UP HIS CAR FROM AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP (ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO) AFTER HAVING THE BRAKES DONE. APPARENTLY, THE EXTRA PRESSURE NEW BRAKE PADS PUT ON THE BRAKE LINES CAUSED ONE BRAKE LINE TO SNAP BY THE BACK OF THE CAR. RICH COMPLETELY LOST HIS BRAKES AT 40 MPH. FORTUNATELY, WHEN HE USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, IT DID THE JOB. HE SAID THERE WAS A CAR TURNING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AND ON-COMING TRAFFIC ON THE LEFT. WITHOUT A GOOD EMERGENCY BRAKE, HIS OPTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE LIMITED.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTS, BUT I FEEL THAT IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME ....  THE PROBLEM RESIDES IN THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  MY CAR HAS AUTO-ADJUST PEDAL HEIGHT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY BOTH PEDALS ADJUST AS A SINGLE UNIT, RATHER THAN ONE-AT-A-TIME.  SIMPLY, THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL IS TOO FAR TO THE LEFT - ABOUT TWO INCHES FROM THE RHS EDGE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL, AND WHEN I DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL, OFTEN THE RIGHT-HAND EDGE OF THE SOLE OF MY SHOE CONTACTS THE SURFACE OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, LEADING TO THE SURGE OF POWER -- WHICH IS THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS MADE WORSE IN THAT WHEN THE BRAKE IS APPLIED, THE PEDAL WILL PASS TO AND THROUGH THE PLANE OF THE SURFACE OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, THUS MAKING THIS SHOE-CONTACT MORE LIKELY.    THERE IS ABUNDANT ROOM TO MOVE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO THE RIGHT - WITH A NEWLY-DESIGNED PEDAL SHAFT.  (THE PRESENT PEDAL \"HOOKS\" TO THE LEFT AT THE BOTTOM PART, SORT OF LIKE THE LOWER PART OF THIS \"9\" DIGIT)  OR, THE PEDALS COULD BE RAISED UP/LOWERED INDEPENDENTLY, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE VERTICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.  A THICKER RUBBER PAD ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS HANDILY -- IT WOULD NEED TO BE ABOUT ONE INCH THICKER.    I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.  I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITHIN A SHORT TIME OF BUYING THE CAR.  I HAVE CONTACTED THEM SEVERAL TIMES, INCLUDING TODAY, BUT SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN UNRESPONSIVE.  (BUT OF COURSE TODAY'S CONVERSATION MAY BEAR FRUIT.  WE SHALL SEE.)  IN THE NOTES OF MY FIRST CALL, ACCORDING TO THE PERSON WHO READ THEM TO ME ON A SUBSEQUENT CALL, MY CONCERN WAS DESCRIBED AS \"...

THE VEHICLE WAS A LATE MODEL LINCOLN TOWN CAR. ONE PERSON WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL AND THE DRIVER DIED A FEW DAYS LATER.     THE FOLLOWING IS A QUOTE FROM THE NEXT DAY BREVARD COUNTY FLORIDA LOCAL NEWSPAPER (FLORIDA TODAY).  ?THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE AT THE INTERSECTION OF WICKHAM ROAD AND LAKE ANDREW DRIVE WAS BEGINNING TO HUM WITH THE RUSH OF FRIDAY EVENING TRAFFIC WHEN A LIGHT BLUE SEDAN HIT THE CURB AND CRASHED THROUGH SOME BUSHES INTO A RETENTION POND.?    ?SOME SAID THE CAR MADE A NOISE LIKE A ROARING FREIGHT TRAIN AS IT PLUNGED INTO THE WATER. A FEW SAID IT SHOT OFF LIKE A ROCKET.? END OF QUOTE.    IT IS TIME SOME ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO THE SERIOUSNESS THIS SAFETY PROBLEM.  IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE MERCURY THAT I HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKE AND GAS PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME. AND EVEN IF YOU DID THE GAS PEDAL WOULD ONLY SLIGHTLY BE DEPRESSED.    I HAVE SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND NUMEROUS SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY VEHICLES. FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD TELL THEIR DEALERS TO STOP THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS FROM GIVING THEIR CUSTOMERS BULL CRAP AND DO THE SENSIBLE THING OF FINDING OUT WHAT IS REALLY WRONG.  *TR",

TURNED SWITCH KEY OFF. MADE 3 ATTEMPTS TO START ENGINE. FINALLY REMOVED KEY FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 SECONDS, CAR STARTED AND SEEMED NORMAL.

OCT.10 DROVE VEHICLE TO LINCOLN-MERCURY DEALER IN OAK RIDGE. THEY STATED THAT IF THE ENGINE SERVICE LIGHT DID NOT COME ON, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND ANY PROBLEM. ON OCT. 19 VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO ISLAND LINCOLN/MERCURY DEALER IN MERRITT ISLAND FL. (VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED THERE.) SERVICE MANAGER DROVE VEHICLE ON TEST DRIVE AND TOLD ME IN A NICE MANNER THAT I MUST HAVE HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES AND GAS PEDAL AT SAME TIME. NOT TRUE. I HAVE TESTED STARTING THIS VEHICLE SEVERAL TIMES WITH ONE FOOT ON BRAKE AND OTHER FOOT ON GAS PEDAL. ENGINE REVS UP NORMALLY, NO RUMBLING WHAT SO EVER. THE RUMBLING CAUSED ME TO BELIEVE THAT SOME CYLINDERS WERE NOT FIRING DURING THIS EVENT.    DEALER DID NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO FIND OR DUPLICATE PROBLEM.
