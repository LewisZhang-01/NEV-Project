On a warmer day after driving for a while I suddenly experienced a unexpected binding of the steering and almost binding ended up steering into oncoming traffic. This really scared me and I started investigating. Yes, this is a known safety defect, but BMW doesn\u2019t do anything about it. NHTSA, which supposed to protect us from unsafe vehicles, did not do their job either. I am a retired Automotive engineer with Fiat-Iveco and NHTSA made my company recall vehicles for much less. The defect gets worse in hot weather and I don\u2019t let my son, friends or anybody else drive the vehicle, as I am afraid that they could get hurt, aside from a liability issue on my side. I can\u2019t really sell the vehicle with a known safety defect from a moral standpoint and I definitely would be liable should the car get involved in an accident caused by a known defect. BMW and NHTSA do your job before somebody gets hurt or killed! Doing nothing, will cost you more in Settlements and Reputation in a long run\u2026the problem will not go away by doing nothing!

I FIRST LEARNED OF THE PROBLEM WHEN ENTERING A FREEWAY FROM AN ON RAMP. THE STEERING, INSTEAD OF ALLOWING ME TO EASE GENTLY INTO A TRAFFIC LANE, WANTED TO CONTINUE TO PULL ME LEFT INTO THE CENTER DIVIDER. I WAS ABLE TO YANK THE WHEEL AND AVOID AN ACCIDENT. I THEN RESEARCHED AND LEARNED ABOUT THE COMMON POWER STEERING ISSUE AND LEARNED THAT A GREASE FITTING INTO THE STEERING COLUMN COULD HELP. I THEN LEARNED THAT MY VEHICLE HAD ALREADY BEEN FITTED WITH SUCH A GREASE FITTING. ADDITIONAL GREASE THEN ALLEVIATED THE PROBLEM TEMPORARILY. EVENTUALLY ADDITIONAL GREASE BECAME LESS EFFECTIVE AND I LEARNED TO DRIVE WITH STEERING THAT WAS STIFF AND PRONE TO STICKINESS. RECENTLY (DECEMBER 2017), THE POWER STEERING BEGAN TO ENTIRELY SHUT OFF INTERMITTENTLY. IT SHUTS OFF AND THEN TURNS ON AGAIN AFTER RESTARTING THE CAR. THE CAR IS THEREFORE NO LONGER DRIVABLE FOR SAFETY REASONS. I'VE LEARNED THAT THE POWER STEERING UNIT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ENTIRELY WITH A PART COST OF $3,400.

THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE IN HEAT OVER 80 DEGREE'S AS THE STEERING WAS TIGHT, AND WOULD STICK IN POSITION CAUSING EXCESS FORCE TO MOVE IT, AND CAUSE SEVERE OVERSTEER SITUATIONS.  AFTER HAVING TO COMPLAIN TO BMW FOR WEEKS, THEY DIRECTED ME TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED (FOR $180) AND THEN DECIDED THEY WOULD PAY HALF OF THE COST TO REPAIR THEIR ENGINEERING ISSUE.  WHILE I FOUND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ADMIT A MISTAKE AND COVER HALF THE REPAIR A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I JUST DON'T THINK ITS ENOUGH.  A NEW STEERING COLUMN WAS QUOTED AT $3750, AND I PAID ALMOST $1800 PLUS DIAGNOSTICS FEES.  I WASN'T GOING TO BOTHER WITH THIS COMPLAINT, AS THE NHTSA HAS SHOWN IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN HOLDING BMW ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS WIDE SPREAD ISSUE (UNLIKE TOYOTAS STICKY GAS PEDALS), BUT AN INCIDENT ON THE FREEWAY THIS WEEK CHANGED MY MIND.  I WAS TRAVELING IN THE LEFT LANE CROSSING A MAJOR RIVER, AND THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME SUDDENLY SWERVED TOWARD THE GUARD BARRIER.  I HAD MILLISECONDS TO REACT TO THE STEEL GARBAGE CAN SET IN THE CENTER OF THE LEFT LANE, WITH A 18 WHEELER TO MY RIGHT.  I SWERVED AS THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME DID, TOWARD THE GUARD BARRIER INTO THE BREAKDOWN LANE AND SAFELY NEGOTIATED THE CAN.  THANK GOD I HAD THE STEERING FIXED, AS IT STUCK WORSE TURNING RIGHT, AND I AM CERTAIN MY LIFE WOULD HAVE ENDED ON THE BRIDGE AS I WOULD HAVE OVERSTEERED, LOST CONTROL, AND WENT UNDER THE 18 WHEELER.

WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING AWHILE (LONGER THAN 1 HOUR, MOST LIKELY HEAT RELATED), THE STEERING BECOMES VERY, VERY STIFF AND FEELS LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOCKED, AND TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL YOU MUST EXERT AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE TO MAKE IT MOVE.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE ALIGNMENT BUT AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ONLINE AND BMW FORUMS IT APPEARS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE E85 (2003-2005) BMW Z4 ROADSTERS.  \"NEED A NEW STEERING COLUMN TO FIX \"STICKY STEERING\" PROB WITH THE EPS @ $3,300. MY 2004 Z4 IS A \"PLEASURE\" CAR WITH 17,000 MILES. NOT A PLEASURE TO FIGHT THE STEERING ON THE ROAD.\" -TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE FORUMS. FORTUNATELY I HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE I DRIVE DAILY AND DON'T HAVE TO COMMUTE DAILY IN THIS VEHICLE. HOWEVER WHEN I DO DRIVE IT IT'S DEFINITELY NOTICEABLE NOT ONLY BY ME BUT MY PASSENGERS, IT'S SCARY EVEN. I PURCHASED MY CAR WITH 69,500 MILES WHICH REALLY IS QUITE LOW CONSIDERING THE YEAR AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HAS COST ME SO MUCH TO OBTAIN GIVES ME AN UNEASY FEELING EVERYTIME I DRIVE IT. WISH I COULD AFFORD TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED BUT BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA $3,000+ TO SPARE TO SPEND TOWARDS THE REPAIR. ANYWAYS HOPING ENOUGH GRIEVANCES WILL BE FILED AND EVENTUALLY BMW WILL OWN UP TO THE PROBLEM AND BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ITS MANY UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS WHO ARE LITERALLY HAZARDS ON THE ROAD DUE TO THIS \"STICKY STEERING\" PROBLEMS AT HIGH SPEEDS.

IT IS FUNNY THAT EACH BLOG STATED THE EXACT SAME STATEMENT FROM THE DEALERSHIPS. THE SECOND THING WAS THAT THEY RECOMMENDED THAT THE STEERING COLUMN BE REPLACED. IF THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE THEN HOW CAN THEY ASSUME THAT REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN IS THE CORRECT REPAIR FOR THE PROBLEM, BMW SHOULD STEP UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM AND RECALL ALL Z-4?S BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, OR SERIOUSLY INJURED.

SOON AFTER THE INITIATION OF THE 2010 NHTSA INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A LOCAL BMW DEALER WHO CLAIMED TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS PREVALENT ISSUE AND WHO WAS REPORTEDLY UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE.  SINCE THEN I FIGURED OUT IT CAN REPLICATED SIMPLY BY SETTING THE HEATER TO FULL BLAST AND LEAVING THE WINDOWS ROLLED UP FOR 20-30 MINUTES TO ALLOW THE HEAT TO SOAK INTO THE ELECTRIC-ASSIST STEERING COLUMN: THIS ISSUE OCCURS IF THE STEERING COLUMN GETS WARM BY ANY MEANS: PARK IN DIRECT SUN ON A HOT DAY, PARK IN SHADE ON A VERY HOT DAY, RUN THE HEATER ON HIGH FOR A WHILE, ETC.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT BMW DEALER ON A MODERATE DAY IN MARCH 2013 AND REPLICATED IT USING THE HEATER WHILE THEIR SERVICE FOREMAN DROVE IT; HE WAS ASTONISHED BY ITS PERVERSE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS AND IMMEDIATELY MADE THE DIAGNOSIS: FAULTY STEERING COLUMN REQUIRING COMPLETE REPLACEMENT.

BMW APPEARS TO RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE, BUT CLAIMS THE EFFECT IS \"MINOR\".  I AM NOT AN EXPERT AND CANNOT SAY WHETHER IT PRESENTS RISK, BUT AS A  DRIVER I CAN TELL YOU ANY STEERING EFFECTS ARE DISTURBING AND DISTRACTING.    BMW CLAIMS THE EFFECT ONLY OCCURS DURING SPECIFIC/LIMITED CONDITIONS - HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND DIRECT SUNLIGHT.  WHAT REALLY UPSETS ME  ABOUT THIS STATEMENT IS THAT IT'S A CONVERTIBLE SPORTS CAR MARKETED FOR THESE CONDITIONS, SO WHILE THEY MAY BE \"SPECIFIC AND LIMITED\", THEY  ARE PRIMARY CONDITIONS FOR THIS CAR.

IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE CAR SMOOTHLY, CHANGE LANES, PASS OTHER CARS. I PURCHASED THE CAR USED WITH ONLY 21,000 MILES, BUT WARRANTY WAS UP IN 6/2008, PURCHASED IN 8/2008. TOM BUSH BMW OF JACKSONVILLE SAYS CAR NEEDS A STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF $2575.08 COST TO ME. I FEEL PROBLEM HAS BEEN ON THE CAR SINCE PURCHASED NEW. CAR CAME FROM OFF LEASE IN OHIO AND DRIVEN ONLY LIMITED AMOUNT. STEERING LOCKUP MORE NOTICEABLE ON WARM TO HOT DAYS, WHICH IS WHEN WE DRIVE THE CAR HERE IN FLORIDA. PLEASE OFFER ASSISTANCE.
