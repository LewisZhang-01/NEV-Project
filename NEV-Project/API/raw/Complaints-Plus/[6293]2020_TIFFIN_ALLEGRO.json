        "summary": "DROVE MY BRAND NEW TIFFIN 2020 ALLEGRO RED FROM THE DEALER IN LOUISIANA TO MY HOME IN OHIO.  THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS QUIT WORKING IN THE MIDST OF A HEAVY RAIN STORM FORCING ME TO PULL OFF THE ROAD UNTIL THE WEATHER SUBSIDED.  THE WIPER MOTOR FELT HOT.  AFTER FINALLY GETTING HOME, TIFFIN INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND SENT ME A BULLETIN THAT WAS ISSUED IN THE SUMMER OF 2019 EXPLAINING HOW TO REWIRE THE MOTOR FROM BATTERY POWER TO IGNITION POWER.  I TOOK THE RV TO A LOCAL TIFFIN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY RV HAD TO BE REPAIRED BY A FREIGHTLINER DEALER, SINCE THEY MADE THE CHASSIS.  TOOK THE RV TO A FREIGHTLINER DEALER IN A NEARBY TOWN AND THEY SAID THAT IT HAD TO BE REPAIRED BY A TIFFIN DEALER.   HERE I AM WITH A NEW RV IN THE MIDDLE OF PRIME TIME CAMPING SEASON AND I CANNOT DRIVE MY RV ANYWHERE IN THE EVENT OF A SEVERE WEATHER AND POUNDING RAIN.  TRYING TO DRIVE THE RV IN HEAVY RAIN IS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN BEING PASSED BY COMMERCIAL TRUCKS THAT BLIND YOU WITH SPLASH.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED BY TIFFIN.*DT*DT  CONSUMER STATED BLINKER INDICATORS DID NOT WORK FROM THE BEGINNING.*JB*JB *TR",
