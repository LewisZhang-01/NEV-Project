The car shuts down unexpectedly without reason. The whole car freezes ! While at the dealership, the tech told us there was another car being repaired with the same issue .Turns out if the back battery gets wet(hidden under the back cup holder)the car shuts down. A cup of coffee spilled in the back seat but there are many reports online (part #J533) with any incidence of wetness. Audi is aware of this problem and although they ordered a new part, the problem is NOT repaired permanently .It can happen again and again .Audi needs to have a major recall on all Q3, Q5 and Q7. We were on a residential street when this happened but a multi vehicle crash would have taken place if on a highway.We are asking for a refund since the car was 2 weeks old at the time with less than 5,000 miles. We need the public to know they are driving a car with a a major design flaw and could cause serious accidents.",

The windows begin going up & down.  Steering began to be hard.  Finally, I was able to steer the q5 out of traffic.  Traffic was going about 40-50 mph.  2.  the q5 was towed to Audi for diagnostic 3.  Audi called & said that the gateway got wet and the cost for the part is $1200. It will take 2 weeks to get the part in.  Audi has no openings until October.  4.  They stated that the water drains are working and that they found a water bottle cap in the backSeat of the car; therefore, the gateway will not be covered under warranty. Huh?  5. I am unsure why the warranty will not cover any Safety issues on a 4 month old car.  6.  Audi is assuming there was a water spill, because there was a water bottle cap in the car.  7.  What are you talking about, Audi?  Why are you assuming things?  What is the real cause of this traumatic experience?  8.  Secondly, no one told me not to have a water bottle cap in the q5 backseat area; the q5 without warning, began to shut down.  9. The engine light stayed on.  10.  Audi is not acting in good faith, why are there assumptions made?   11.  Audi must recall the q5 and announce a public safety warning of the danger that is lurking  in the back seat called a gateway.   12.  Audi must clearly state \u201cDanger! Danger!  No water bottle caps allowed in backseat\u201d.   13.  Also, not to mention, there were no Audi loaner cars available; this gives off the appearance  that Audi is making a lot of repairs and they are aware of this $1200 \u201cwater bottle cap\u201d problem called a gateway.  14. I am aware my experience is possibly rare, BUT it must not happen ever.   This was a dangerous scary experience that must not happen again to me or any family!  15. Pls demand Audi to recall these q5s to relocate the gateway, before someone dies!!! 16.  I will trade in q5 to avoid death...",

        "summary": "I leased a 2021 Audi Q5 (VIN: WA1BAAFY7M2[XXX]) in November 2020. 2021 Audi Q5 has gateway module underneath the middle row seat. The gateway module is like the brain of the car and if it stops working the car stops - basically the car is brain dead. In my case, I was driving the car with my family i.e. wife, 7 and 3 year old kids when the car abruptly shut off. Luckily, I was on a road with 45 MPH speed limit and no traffic, so nothing happened to us. If this happened on a highway or other situation anything could have happened to me and my family. After safely parking the car and getting it towed to Audi Westmont, the car was inspected, and I was informed about the gateway module issue. To my shock, the mechanic said that it\u2019s a design flaw that Audi is aware of but doesn't have a solution yet. Furthermore, he said that just at Laurel Audi in Westmont 4 cars were repaired for this problem. When I googled, several Audi owners have faced this problem. As I mentioned earlier, despite knowing the issue Audi didn't inform the owners and yet to inform the owners despite this being a serious enough problem that could put owners/families in a life threatening situation. Here's the link to the video taken during the diagnosis of the problem: https://asr.autonation.com/tV0Ij5Ym5c. I have also attached picture of the hodgepodge fix i.e. wrapping gateway module in plastic. The reason I say it is hodgepodge is that wrapping in plastic won't prevent water from condensing on gateway module and the problem repeating. Preceding the days my car had this problem, there were heavy rains and humidity was very high, as noted in the video there is no source of water leak or water entering the gateway module externally, given that finding and the fact that there was heavy rains, high humidity in the preceding days - condensation can likely be the potential cause of the problem. There are thousands of 2021 Audi Q5's and every single one has this risk.

A brake malfunction warning light appeared on the dashboard and within 5 seconds the car completely shut down in the middle lane of the parkway (in a black car at 10pm). This was the first notification or warning--nothing in the prior minutes or days. The driver was unable to restart the vehicle after several attempts and was unable to drift to the shoulder of the parkway. The SOS button in the vehicle didn't work and hazards didn't appear to be working either. Several cars driving at or above the 65 mph speed limit were braking and swerving at the last second to avoid collision and several cursed at the vehicle (as they were unable to see the vehicle in the darkness). Passenger in front seat called 911 to request assistance to provide a roadblock as it seemed imminent that the vehicle was going to be hit. 911 operator said safest place was to remain in the vehicle given the vehicle location and the speed of other drivers. The radio briefly turned back on and then turned off. Nothing else was working. When the tow arrived, the driver notified the individuals that the front hazards were working but the back hazards were\u00a0not. The vehicle was towed to the local Audi Service Center. Eleven days after Audi accessed the vehicle, a report was received which said that the vehicle had an \"elec[trical] malf[unction]\" and that they \"found car would not turn on and no communication to any control units.
