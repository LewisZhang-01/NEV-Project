LIKE I SAID I SEEN A LOT OF BRAKE SYSTEMS AND THIS WAY THEY HAVE IT IS NOT SAME AND I IMAGINE HAS CAUSED DEATHS, IF NOT YET IT WILL, IT ABOUT MADE ME ROLL AND SCREWED UP MY RIMS AND NEW TIRES, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SELL IT BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO GET THEM ALL REPLACED. SO IM GOING TO SEE IF THERE IS A RECALL AND IF NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE. MY MOM HAVE A 2004  SILVERADO CHEVY AND I OWNED A 2002 BEFORE AND BOTH TRUCKS BRAKE SYSTEM ARE DIFFERENT. I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY ARE LIKE THIS AND WHY THEY CHANGE A GOOD THING. I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL. SO IF YOU HEAR GRINDING IN TIRES MAKE SURE YOU STOP AND GET IT TOWED.  *TR",

THE PARKING BRAKE IS A HORSESHOE SHAPED BRAKE SHOE THAT IS TO GRAB A BRAKE DRUM DESIGNED INTO THE REAR WHEEL ROTOR. I HAVE USED THE PARKING BRAKE ABOUT FIVE TIMES( EXAGGERATED) IN THE LIFE OF MY TRUCK. WHEN THE BRAKE FAILED TO HOLD I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT, AS I RARELY USED IT.   RECENTLY ON AN UNRELATED REPAIR I HAD OCCASION TO REMOVE AND INSPECT MY REAR ROTORS. THE BRAKE SHOE FOR THE PARKING BRAKE REPOSITIONED ITSELF AND HAS BEEN RUBBING ON THE BRAKE DRUM PORTION OF THE ROTOR CAUSING IT TO WEAR THE LINING OF THE DRUM . VERY LITTLE WEAR OCCURRED TO THE PARKING BRAKE SHOE. THE DESIGN OF THE  SHOE ITS POSITION ON THE DRUM CREATED A BASIN WEAR PARTICLES ACCUMULATED INSIDE THE WORN AREA OF THE DRUM CREATING EVEN FASTER WEAR TO THE SURFACE.   AFTER 180000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE I HAVE THE ORIGINAL DISC BRAKE PADS IN RELATIVELY GOOD SHAPE AND IF I HADN'T HAD THE OTHER REPAIR TO PERFORM I WOULD NOT HAVE REMOVED THE DIC BRAKE ROTOR ON THE REAR WHEELS TO LEARN THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE DRUM MATERIAL HAD BEEN WON THROUGH ON ONE SIDE AND LESS SO ON THE OTHER SIDE.   I WAS NOT SUBJECT TO RECALL 05042B (NHTSA ACTION NUMBER EA04011) AND I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PREVIOUS ISSUE WITH THE PARKING BRAKES.  IF I CONTINUED TO USE THE VEHICLE IN UNADULTERATED MANNER MY WHEEL ROTOR WOULD WEAR THROUGH AND THE WHEEL FALL OFF AT A TIME OF ITS OWN CHOOSING..   I SPOKE WITH MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AND ASKED ABOUT APPLICABLE RECALLS REGARDING THE PARKING BRAKE ON THE PICKUPS AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW OF NO SUCH ISSUES. *TR",

UPON REPAIR OF THE MAIN BRAKE LINE  AT $244.32 (I DECLINED TO HAVE ALL BRAKE LINES REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE) THEY TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE AND INDICATED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOW SPEED BRAKE FAILURE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A VEHICLE WITH LESS THAN  90,000 MILES SHOULD HAVE BRAKE LINES RUST THROUGH, THAT TWO SETS OF ROTORS RUST TO THE POINT OF FAILURE.  THIS DEGREE OF RUST TO THE BRAKING SYSTEM APPEARS EXCESSIVE AND UNWARRANTED.  IN LOOKING AT INTERNET APPEARS TO BE SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH 2000 GMC AND CHEVY PICKUPS.

MY GMC SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WAS TO REPLACE THE FRONT HUB ASSEMBLIES CONTAINING THE WHEEL SPEED SENSORS AT A COST OF $500 EACH FOR PARTS ONLY. I DECIDED AGAINST THAT IDEA AND OPTED TO REMOVE THE ABS FUSE UNDER THE DASH BOARD.     I KEPT INQUIRING AT THE DEALER ABOUT ANY GM SPONSORED REPAIRS AND FINALLY READ ABOUT THE AUGUST 29, 2005 RECALL NOTICE WHICH INVOLVED CLEANING, SANDING, AND LUBRICATING THE WHEEL SPEED SENSORS. THE RECALL SERVICE WORK WAS DONE ON 10/13/05, ACCORDING TO SERVICE BULLITIN #05068, BUT MY TRUCK CONTINUED TO DRIFT INTO TRAFFIC AS BEFORE. THIS TIME I REMOVED THE ABS FUSE FROM UNDER THE HOOD SO I COULD FINALLY USE THE CRUISE CONTROL AGAIN. THE SERVICE MANAGER HAS SINCE TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NO AUTHORIZED FOLLOW UP PROCEDURE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE THE HUB ASSEMBLIES OR SPEED SENSORS, AT MY EXPENSE. THE BRAKES FUNCTION ADEQUATELY WITHOUT THE ABS FUSE, BUT THE RED BRAKE FAILURE LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL IS ON CONTINUALLY, AS WELL AS THE AMBER ABS LIGHT. IF I GO BACK TO REMOVING THE INTERIOR ABS FUSE, THE RED LIGHT WILL GO OUT AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO INDICATE ANY OTHER CAUSE FOR BRAKE FAILURE, BUT I SACRAFICE THE CRUISE CONTROL. GM HAS ADMITTED THAT THEY DESIGNED A DEFECTIVE ABS SYSTEM THAT IS PRONE TO RUST AND CORROSION IN CERTAIN \"RUST BELT\" STATES AND PROVINCES OF CANADA AND THEY ARE AWARE THAT THESE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN UNSAFE TO OPERATE. THE INEFFECTIVE RECALL REPAIRS TO MY TRUCK COST GENERAL MOTORS $46.88 ON THE INVOICE AND YET THEY EXPECT ME TO PAY ABOUT $1,200 TO REALLY REPAIR AND REPLACE THEIR DEFECTIVE PARTS. I DON'T THINK SO.",

ONE FRACTURED ABOUT A YEAR AGO, THE OTHER IS CLOSE TO BREAKING. I CONTACTED GM ABOUT GETTING TEMPORARY REPLACEMENTS THAT THEY ALSO STATE IN THE RECALL. THIS IS WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT MY VIN WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL. MY QUESTION IS, HOW COULD IT NOT BE PART OF THE RECALL?  I HAVE A 2000 SIERRA AND MY CABLES ARE CORRODED, WEAKENED AND FRACTURED. I WOULD THINK ALL CABLES THAT WERE MANUFACTURED WITH GALVANIZED STEEL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CORRODING BECAUSE OF MOISTURE. GM EVEN STATES IN THEIR RECALL QUESTION/ANSWER SECTION THAT \"MOISTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS MAY ENTER BETWEEN THE METAL STRANDS OF THE CABLE AT EITHER END OF THE CABLE AND IN SOME CASES, THE BLACK PLASTIC SHEATHING MAY BECOME CRACKED OR TORN DURING NORMAL USAGE CREATING A PATH FOR MOISTURE ENTRY. MOISTURE MAY COLLECT AND CONCENTRATE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE CABLE DURING NORMAL USAGE OF THE TAILGATE, THE CABLE IS FLEXED AT THE MIDPOINT. REPEATED FLEXING, PLUS CORROSION CAUSED BY THE MOISTURE AND CONTAMINANTS, MAY WEAKEN THE METAL STRANDS, AND THEY CAN EVENTUALLY SEVER UNDER LOAD.\" THE FACT IS, THE CABLES ARE BREAKING DUE TO THE GALVANIZED STEEL CORRODING. IT SEEMS LIKE GM IS TRYING TO GET BY WITH REPLACING AS FEW OF THE POORLY DESIGNED CABLES AS THE NHTSA WILL LET THEM GET BY WITH. IF YOU WOULD LIKE DIGITAL PHOTOS OF MY BROKEN/CORRODED CABLES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE WITH GETTING MY CABLES REPLACED.  BUT MORE THEN ANYTHING, I THINK GM SHOULD BE FORCED THE CORRECT THIS ISSUE ON ALL THEIR VEHICLES THAT USE GALVANIZED STEEL IN THEIR CABLES.

THE ODOMETER READING WAS APPROXIMATELY 48,000 MILES WHEN THIS PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED.    IN SEPTEMBER 2003 THE GAUGE WOULD ONLY REGISTER FULL.  AT THIS TIME I HAD THE TRUCK INSPECTED BY TWO INDEPENDENT GARAGES.  THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A NUMBER OF GMC'S WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT SEEMED THAT THE 1999-2001 MODELS HAD A DEFECTIVE PART.  WHEN I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP IN SEPTEMBER 2003 I WAS TOLD THAT THE FUEL TANK WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE PART.  I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THE COST OF THIS REPAIR WOULD BE $650.00, INCLUDING PARTS (THE PART COST WAS $395.83).  I WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE MILEAGE ON THE TRUCK WAS APPROXIMATELY 64,000 MILES, THE WARRANTY DID NOT COVER THE COST OF THIS REPAIR.

AFTER ABOUT FIVE OR SIX TRIPS TO THE DEALER THEY FINALLY INSTALLED A NEW COMPUTER COMPONENT THAT HAD BEEN RECALLED AND FIXED THE PROBLEM.  NOW MY WARRANTY IS UP AND THE GAS PEDAL SEEMS TO STICK MORE OFTEN.  I CAN LIVE WITH IT WHILE TRAVELING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T STICK AT A CURRENT SPEED THAT I AM DRIVING AT; IT STICKS WHEN I WANT TO START OUT OR ACCELERATE.  MY CONCERN IS THAT RECENTLY WHEN I STARTED THE TRUCK IT STUCK TO THE POINT THAT WHEN I TRIED TO DEPRESS IT STUCK AND THEN FREED TO WHERE I DARTED OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT.  THIS WAS SCARY AND I DECIDED I HAD BETTER REPORT IT TO THE DEALER.  I HAD A SERVICE COMPLETED ON MAY 23, 02 AND RAISED MY CONCERNS WITH SHAWN D. IN THE SERVICE DEPT. AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN (NAME UNKNOWN).  THE UNKNOWN PARTY ASKED ME IF MY TRUCK WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND I TOLD HIM NO.  I ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM AS IT COULD BE A MAJOR ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  HE SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT IT WAS A CARBON BUILDUP THAT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR TO REPAIR.  HE SAID GM HASN'T DECIDED TO RECALL IT AT THIS POINT.  I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD THAT WAS A MANUFACTURER'S BOO BOO.

IN OCTOBER WHEN WAITING FOR A TRAFFIC LIGHT TO CHANGE, I ACCELLERATED  AND TRUCK DIDN'T MOVE. I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE SHIFTED TO PARK AND THEN BACK TO DRIVE AND IT FINALLY WENT INTO GEAR AND MOVED.

ALSO, WHILE STOPPED AT INTERSECTIONS, NOTICED BRAKE PEDAL VERY SLOWLY MOVING TO THE FLOOR WHILE FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL.  IMMEDIATELY TOOK TRUCK TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPT. AND THE SERVICE DEPT. DIAGNOSED IT AS A LEAKING MASTER CYLINDER.  THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS REPLACED HOWEVER I STILL NOTICE BRAKE PEDAL SEEKING POINT OF LEAST RESISTANCE WHILE CROSSING RAILROAD CROSSINGS AND DIPS/MODERATE BUMPS IN THE ROAD.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK AS A FAMILY TRUCK AND IT CARRIES MY CHILDREN ON A REGULAR BASIS.  I FEEL THAT MASTER CYLINDER SHOULD NOT HAVE LEAKED AT 822 MILES.  OTHER ISSUE>>> HIGHWAY SPEED VIBRATIONS:  TRUCK HAS HAD A PERSISTENT HIGHWAY SPEED VIBRATION (40-45 MPH AND 60-70 MPH).  THE TRUCK WAS SERVICED FOR THIS PROBLEM ON SEPT. 27 AND OCT. 5.  SEPT. 27 THEY BALANCED THE WHEELS.  ON OCT. 5, THEY BALANCED THE WHEELS AGAIN AND SUGGESTED THAT THE WHEEL WEIGHTS ARE \"COMING OFF\" CAUSING UNBALANCED TIRES.  WHEEL WEIGHTS HAVE REMAINED INTACT AS OF THIS DATE BUT VIBRATION STILL EXIST.  THE VIBRATION FEELS LIKE IT STARTS AT THE REAR OF THE TRUCK AND MIGRATES THROUGH THE TRUCK TO THE STEERING COLUMN AND WHEEL WHICH ON OCCASION HAS EXHIBITED MODERATE TO HEAVY SHAKING INCLUDING SEATS AND DASH.  WHILE IN TURNS AT TIMES AND GOING OVER BUMPS, STEERING WHEEL SHAKES GIVING THE SENSE OF NOT IN CONTROL.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE VEHICLE SHAKES AND VIBRATES WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE TO CORRECT.  THE GM FACTORY REP. WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE TIRES TO THE SAME BRAND, GOODYEAR WRANGLERS, HOWEVER I SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT THE TRUCK WAS IN FOR VIBRATION TWICE AND I SUGGESTED SWAPPING TIRES/WHEELS TO SEE IF THIS WOULD SOLVE PROBLEM AND THEY INDICATED THEY DID SWAP BUT IT DID NOT SOLVE PROBLEM.
