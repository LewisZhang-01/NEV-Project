I HAVE READ THAT IF THEY FIX THE PROBLEM IT WOULD INCREASE THE FUEL CONSUMPTION, I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SAFE AUTOMOBILE THAT GET A LITTLE LESS MILES PER GALLON THEN AN UNSAFE CAR THAT COULD END UP KILLING SOMEONE. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE CONVEYED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE A BUICK ENCLAVE WITH THIS DEFECT SO THEY CAN DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO DRIVE A UNSAFE VEHICLE. I BELIEVE MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS BEGAN RIGHT AFTER THE BAILOUTS BY THE GOVERNMENT, COULD IT BE GENERAL MOTORS DECIDED TO CUT BACK ON SAFETY FEATURES ON ITS VEHICLES IN ORDER TO REGAIN THEIR PROFITABILITY IN THE CAR MARKET AND MAKE THEM LOOK GOOD.  *TR",

WHEN YOU TURN USUALLY AT SLOWER SPEEDS THE STEERING WHEEL WILL BECOME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AT YOUR DESIGNATED TARGET. IN MY OPINION AND IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON FACTOR WITH THIS SPECIFIC GM/BUICK MODEL THAT OUT OF ALL THE RECALLS THE STEERING WAS THE BIGGEST CONCERN MENTIONED BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED ALONG WITH THE OTHER ISSUES FROM THIS VEHICLE. I PURCHASED THE 2009 BUICK ENCLAVE BECAUSE I TRUSTED GM VEHICLES AND I HAD MY THIRD CHILD ON THE WAY SO MY FIRST CHOICE WAS A GM VEHICLE. PRESENTLY, MY MIND AND TRUST HAS CHANGED ABOUT GM VEHICLES BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS IGNORING THIS HUGE ISSUE THAT NUMEROUS CONSUMERS HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS ON. SINCE MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN BORN I REFUSE TO PUT HER IN THAT VEHICLE BECAUSE OF SUCH FEAR THAT WE WILL HAVE AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES GOING ON WITH MY 09 BUICK ENCLAVE. THIS IS VERY UPSETTING SINCE MYSELF LIKE MANY THAT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE THOUGHT OF THE PURCHASE AS AN INVESTMENT OR A NEW FRESH STEP IN LIFE. BUT NOW IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADDED STRESS TO MY FAMILIES LIFE INCLUDING A DANGER TO NOT JUST US BUT OTHERS.  *TR",

FURTHER RESEARCH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM HAS A DESIGN IS DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA).
