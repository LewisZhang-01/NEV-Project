AT THAT TIME, WE HAD JUST OVER 34,000 MILES ON THE VAN.  THESE WERE NORMAL MILES WITH NO HEAVY TOWING OR OTHER ABUSIVE DRIVING.  THE VAN WAS TOWED TO JIM COGDILL DODGE FOR REPAIR.  THIS REPAIR WAS STILL COVERED UNDER OUR WARRANTY.  WE WERE TOLD AT THE TIME OF THE REPAIR THAT IT ONLY REQUIRED THE TRANSMISSION BE ??REFURBISHED?? AS THE WARRANTY DID NOT REQUIRE THEM TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.    THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AGAIN AT JUST OVER 60K MILES.  THIS TIME THERE WAS A LOUD POP, A HARD JERK OF THE VAN AND THEN IT CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP AS I WAS CROSSING ONCOMING TRAFFIC TO PULL INTO A  PARKING LOT. I AM VERY LUCKY THIS DID NOT HAPPEN ON THE INTERSTATE AS MYSELF, AND OTHERS, WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED BY THIS PRODUCT FAILURE.     I ASKED TO SPEAK IMMEDIATELY TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, MR. LARRY DAUGHTRY.  HE PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT EVEN THOUGH THE TRANSMISSION WAS FIXED PREVIOUSLY BY A DODGE DEALER, I WOULD BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS . HE ALSO INFORMED ME HE HAS NEVER SEEN SUCH DAMAGE IN A TRANSMISSION THAT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A PRODUCT DEFECT.  I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IF THE SERVICE HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN A DODGE DEALER, BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE!  HE THEN OFFERED TO CONTACT THE DISTRICT MANAGER, WHOSE NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION SEEMS TO BE HELD IN THE UTMOST SECRECY AS HE WILL ONLY ACCEPT CALLS FROM THE DEALER, BUT HE MAY BE WILLING TO PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE.    UPON CALLING FOR A STATUS.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN ITS ENTIRETY AT A COST OF ALMOST $3000.00!  THE DISTRICT MANAGER DID OFFER TO TAKE CARE OF 50% OFF THE TOTAL COST.  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO ARGUE THIS WITH THE DEALER AND THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE.

THE VEHICLE HAS 55,000 MILES THEY SAY THE 7/70 WARRENTY DIDNT APPLY TO MY MODEL.  THE SECOND MECHANIC SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE FILTER OR THE FLUID THAT THEY HAVE TO REPLACE A LOT OF THESE PART THE WELDS FAIL ALOT.  I CALLED DIAMLER/CHRYSLER AND TOLD THEM WHAT THE MECHANIC SAID THAT I WANTED TO SEND THEM BACK THE PART THAT SHOWED THAT THE FAILURE WAS MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT IT WHY IT FAILED JUST THAT IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE PART.

SO FAR THE HATCH DOESN'T WORK WHEN THIS PART FAILED I WAS ALSO NOTIFIED THAT THE WHEEL CYLINDER ON THE REAR BRAKES FAILED AND THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED FIRE TO THE VEHICLE THE DEALERSHIP WANTED 4.000 PLUS TAX TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS.
