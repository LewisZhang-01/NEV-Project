Starting in December of 2021 and continuing to this day I will periodically get an error message that says \"Service Hybrid Electrical System\" and the car will either not start or shut off while it is in motion.  I have contacted Jeep Cares and have been elevated to their customer retention group to continue to try to solve this issue.  The dealer has been great at trying to fix the issue but they have admitted that they don't know what it is or how to fix it and are relying on the national Jeep engineers to help try to fix it.  Talking with the mechanics at the dealer they keep saying the national Jeep engineers are just guessing at this point on what the issue is and they don't know what the issue is either.   I am far from the only one that is having this issue.  If you search any Jeep forum you will find countless other owners with the same issue, https://www.4xeforums.com/search/37154/?q=service+hybrid+electrical+system The underlying issue with the Jeep 4xe's is a huge public safety issue.  This is due to the fact that the Jeep 4xe will randomly turn off while driving, such as driving down a highway going 60mph.",

A car stalling (this has been reported at as high as 70 miles per hour) during operation is a safety concern for myself and of all others driving on the road. We were informed that this could happen anytime after the check engine light illuminates, or as it turns on in many cases. The fact that there has not been a large scale recall, and that we were not informed of the issue when obtaining the vehicle is a huge safety hazard.",

I have had it to dealer they can\u2019t verify concern, contacted Jeep last week still no response back. This is a on going concern with owners online since 2012 it needs to be addressed and repaired.  In fact some type of recall for this concern should be addressed as these vehicles are unsafe under these conditions. This vehicle has no modifications it is as purchased .Only has 8600 miles and afraid to drive on highway. Any help with this concern would be greatly appreciated.

We have a brand new 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe--bought it one month ago--and two weeks in, while driving, the check engine light came on.  We were out of town so called the local dealer but they could not see us for three weeks.  So we researched the issue and thought it could be a loose gas cap etc.  We did some trouble shooting but nothing changed.  Then, while driving, the entire dash lit up with various warnings, including the hybrid warning, and it just shut down.  We were next to a parking lot and coasted in.  Through a series of actions we were able to get it driving again and made it to another dealership.  When we arrived all signals were gone and they could find no trouble codes to check.  We were able to drive back home and we thought maybe it was the loose gas cap issue.  We would have taken it into the dealership as a precaution, but service appts are weeks out.  And it drove fine for several days.   Then our daughter was driving it on an extremely busy and dangerous road.  Luckily she'd just turned off it into our neighborhood--but she was still driving at a decent speed--and all of a sudden all the warning lights came on again, including the hybrid signal, and the car completely shut down on her.  Stopped mid-drive and mid-road.  We now have had it towed to the dealership.  We have also read all the similar stories now with Jeep 4xes and have serious concerns about the extent of this issue and thus the safety of the vehicle.  The dealership can't look at it for weeks, but we have already contacted sales to see what they can do.  I feel like it could take months to work out what is happening here--especially with service backups--and I do not feel safe with any of our family members doing a back and forth on this until we find out that a serious recall in underway.",

After turning the Jeep off then back one the problem cleared.  I suspect this was caused by the Adaptive Cruise Control system.  It had started to brake hard for a car not actually in my lane.  At the same moment people were pulling in behind me to move over for a police car on the shoulder. The Adaptive Cruise Control started what was a hard brake check on this traffic, so I overrode it by pressing on the accelerator, at which point it died.   At the dealer they determined from the codes that the transmission control unit had shut off the engine control unit.  Otherwise nothing could be determined as being wrong with the vehicle.

I was unable to move the car, and instead had to put the car in park and turn off the engine. The \"D\" light on the gear shifter was blinking, and then the battery on the car went from 55% charge down to 47% charge. A red lightning bolt emergency sign came on but then went off immediately after. With the car off in the middle of the road, I restarted it hoping for the best. Luckily, it did restart fine and I could continue driving. However, I have heard on Jeep 4xe forums that this is an issue with many other owners, some even happening on the interstates. I am now too afraid to drive this car with my child or for long distances, because this issue was completely spontaneous and unpredictable. I took it to the dealer to be serviced, but they are unsure what is going on. And as a side note, this is a brand new car (2021 year) with 105 miles. I only had it for FIVE days before this happened. Prior to this incident I also noticed that the charge would not hold very long at all - for example, driving it today 3.4 miles from one point to the dealer, the charge went from 47% to 17% - this should not be normal. Overall this issue is unacceptable and this needs to be addressed immediately before people die. Thanks for your consideration.",

You cannot steer the vehicle very well during this loss of power. - The vehicle usually will not restart and must be towed in or, in some cases, the battery can be disconnected causing the vehicle to reset and allowing it to begin operating again. This solution can work for a several power cycles or none at all. - When this happens, and you attempt to restart the vehicle sometimes when the power returns you are unable to tell if the vehicle is in neutral, drive, reverse, park, etc.  - I experienced a case where the vehicle was in the Run position and the power windows would not open. When it was in the Off position, the windows would open. Perhaps this is intended behavior.  - The seatbelt light will stay on even though all passengers in the vehicle are buckled in. It is unclear if this is part of the same issue, but it seems to be. - Systems compromised: Steering, braking, power/engine, seatbelts, etc.  Examples of Incidents: - Driving in neighborhood (Safe Location) - Driving at highway speed (Unsafe Occurrence) - Driving on an off-road trail (thankfully with others) (Unsafe Occurrence) - Driving at highway speed - We almost crashed twice trying to get off the hwy.

However this really didn't solved the problem and may owners have been complaining about the same unsafe wandering or pulling of the vehicle from left or right.  I have take it to the dealer and also called Chrysler direct, so they can open case number (80562177).  After 30 days at the dealer the outcome was to increase the tow to +.35 from Chrysler's recommended +.20. It is my understanding both +.35 and +.20 are within the manufacture's recommended specifications.  Normally isn't the toe supposed to be near or at zero (0).  It seems that setting the toe to +.35 is a band-aid.  While the wandering and pulling has decreased I fear this is short term solution and it may cause unseen premature failure of other components.",

        "summary": "The actual malfunctioning issue is UNKNOWN. However, my best explanation is as follows: While driving my new 2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (which only has 1400 miles), on the highway at roughly 70 miles per hour and going up a hill, the vehicle felt as if it were trying to up-shift a gear but then immediately down-shift a gear. This up-shift and down-shift feeling continued in quick repetition over and over in a violent shaking manner that thrust the entire vehicle forwards and backwards as long as I continued the acceleration up the hill. Letting off the accelerator seemed to end the violent shaking. I pulled over on to the side of the highway to stop, and turned off the Jeep since the check engine light came on. I waited about five minutes and started up the Jeep again. The check engine light was still on, though. Any acceleration at any speed now causes the Jeep to violently thrust forwards and backwards like I experienced on the highway. I tried to get Jeep Roadside to tow the Jeep to a dealership, but learned how worthless this Jeep Roadside program truly was. Several days after this incident, and I still do not have my Jeep at a dealership for repairs, nor do I have a rental. Jeep Roadside refuses to tow my Jeep to a dealership that has a rental, and I cannot afford to pay the towing fee's to get to a dealership with a rental. The nearest dealerships tell me they are six to eight weeks out on loaner vehicles. I'm too worried to try and driving my Jeep the distance to reach a dealership with a rental, cause it is way too unsafe to operate this Jeep with the violent shaking. I'm curious if anyone else is having this same issue, or knows more.",

It took all my husband's strength to control the vehicle when the power steering went out.  We had to maneuver to the side of the road.  If I had been driving, I fear what would have happened.  We had the vehicle taken to our local dealer.  Darcars Chrysler Plymouth and Jeep in Waldorf MD.  The service technician there said he had no idea what was wrong and it would take several days to get it looked at.  We took to the internet to research our issue.  We found over and over people with a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon from model years 2019-2021 having the same issues.  The issue turns out to be a problem with the \"wiring harness\".  The Jeep forums online have documented instances of this problem by many, many people.  Jeep should be forced to recall these wiring harnesses since they won't do a voluntary recall.  This is a dangerous defect.  Our vehicle has 6,000 miles on it.  Our vehicle is available to inspect at the dealer.  Someone is going to die if this defect isn't addressed.",

Lane changing requires overcorrection due to the wandering. Difficult to hold straight line. Dealer says nothing is wrong and that's how it is and nothing they can do to fix. Dealer states they cannot duplicate. This is a known issue from FCA on previous years and has continued into some 2021 models. Not being able to drive within the lanes poses a hazard to driver, passengers, and other vehicles on the road. Overcorrection due to extreme sensitivity will create a roll over hazard.",

Since buying this jeep brand new, the vehicle information intermittently shows the axle lockers being engaged in 2wd high (2H).  I have brought it to the dealer twice for this problem.  First they reset the computer.  The second time they replaced the 4wd module.  The incorrect status is redisplayed again.  I have only had this jeep for 2 months, it has less than 3000 miles on it.  The dealer doesn't seem to know what the problem is.  I have talked with Jeep corporate who also says they can find no reports of this issue.  However the internet jeep forums are full of people reporting this problem, supposedly it is related to failed axle locker sensors on the Rubicon wranglers.  It is common enough an aftermarket company sells a wiring harness that bypasses the sensor.  Because the sensor is not available separately, eventually this requires the entire axle be replaced.  Some people have had their axles replaced 3-4 times.  There really should be a recall.  More than a few posters have also stated their axles have locked by themselves in 2H.  This could cause a crash as axle lockers are not designed for use on pavement or at high speeds.

        "summary": "I have a brand new 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe, which is a hybrid and electric vehicle, which gives about 30 miles on a full battery charge. Since the electric mode distance is limited, the car has a hybrid and gas-only mode that runs on gas for when the battery needs a charge after 30 miles. The following problem occurred over 10 times in a 2 day timeframe:   The vehicle gave a dashboard warning that stated \"service charging system\" and \"service transmission\" plus my Jeep app gave a message \"a charge fault has occurred.\" Within 10 seconds, the entire car shut off. At the time, I was going 60 mph on a freeway. This nearly caused a 10-car pile up, but I was fortunately able to get onto the shoulder despite the entire electrical system shutting down. I was lucky, because after 10 seconds, the car came to an immediate stop and I could not move it at all. At the time, I had two-thirds full tank of gas.   I was able to start the engine about 15 minutes later. Shortly thereafter, the same problem occurred again after about 5 minutes of driving. This sequence repeated itself over 10 times until I was able to get towed to a nearby dealership. I was advised that the battery needed to be charged and this problem would not occur. This is an unacceptable explanation, since this vehicle has a gas-only mode to account for the 30 mile electrical battery distance. The following day, I got a full charge, but the problem happened again on the freeway, this time with 20% battery remaining and a one-half tank of gas. I had to get towed for the second time in two days.   This is a very dangerous problem. This car should be recalled. Someone could have died due to the car completely shutting off while on a freeway and coming to a total half after only 10 seconds.   The Jeep 4xe online forum reports 10 separate episodes of the same problem. I have attached a pdf of the formum to prove this is a recurrent issue. I am certain that someone will suffer a fatality from this recurrent problem.",

The issue occurs both at speeds above 50...and at a speed of 15 miles. This steering column of this vehicle is defective and a true danger on the highway. The manufacturer refuses to take any responsibility in spite of ample knowledge and notice by consumers. Complaints about this issue are all over the internet.

IT HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN OFF ROAD AT ALL, AND ONLY ON CITY STREETS, HIGHWAYS, AND INTERSTATES, NO ACCIDENTS.       WHILE DRIVING ON A NEARBY INTERSTATE IN JANUARY OF 2021, AT ABOUT 77 MPH, A MINOR SEAM IN THE ROAD SENT MY VEHICLE INTO WHAT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS  'DEATH WOBBLE' MODE. HAD ABOUT 4,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. ON A FIVE HOUR ROAD TRIP, IT HAPPENED OVER A DOZEN TIMES ON THAT TRIP ALONE.I VIDEOED THE CAR IN VIOLENT WOBBLE AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND RETURNED THE CAR FOR ANOTHER DAY OF SERVICE.       THE LOCAL JEEP SERVICE CENTER ORDERED A 'STEERING DAMPER' ASSEMBLY AS A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE 2021 WRANGLERS COME WITH THAT STEERING DAMPER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT STARTING THIS YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PART IS ON AN EXTENDED BACK-ORDER, I AM TOLD, AND WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME.       IN THE MEANTIME, THEY DID A 'ROAD-FORCE' WHEEL AND TIRE BALANCE AS AN INTERIM FIX. ONE TIRE WAS AT 24 LBS, ONE WAS AT 17 LBS, AND THE OTHER TWO WERE AT 10 LBS AND 1 LBS.       SINCE THEN THE CAR HAS HAD FEWER, MOMENTARY, WOBBLES OF MUCH SHORTER DURATION, AND HAS RECOVERED QUICKLY MORE IT DOES WOBBLE BRIEFLY AT SLOWER SPEEDS NOW AS WELL.       WHILE DRIVING, I CAN FEEL THE SUPPRESSED WOBBLES IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND GAS PEDAL  AND AM CONCERNED FOR SAFETY AND CONTINUED WEAR AND DAMAGE TO FRONT SUSPENSION AND TIRES, AND THE FREQUENCY OF HAVING TO DO COSTLY ROAD FORCE BALANCING ON THE TIRES. I LOVE THE JEEP BUT I'VE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR AT THIS POINT.       I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO UPLOAD SOME VIDEO OF ONE OF MY CARS DEATH WOBBLES, SHOWING ITS INTENSITY, AND REFUSAL TO SUBSIDE UNTIL DECELERATED TO ABOUT 55 MPH.
