MY SEAT IS AT HIGHEST POSITION.  JUST AS POINT OF REFERENCE I HAD A 2012 MINI CONV. AND THIS WAS NOT A PROBLEM.   BECAUSE OF THIS I HAD TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND GET ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH COST ME IN EXCESS OF $5000 AS MY 3 DAY OLD CAR WAS CONSIDERED USED WITH 91 MILES ON IT.  MY HUSBAND WHO IS 5'9\" TALL TRIED IT AND HAD SOME VISIBILITY BUT VERY LIMITED.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS THING AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BY MINI.  EITHER THE MECHANISM OR THE FABRIC USED HAS TO BE CHANGED TO ALLOW THE TOP TO RETRACT OUT OF SIGHT.  THIS DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE MOVING OR STANDING STILL, AND COULD CAUSE THE DRIVE TO EASILY HAVE AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE WHAT IS BEHIND THEM.",
