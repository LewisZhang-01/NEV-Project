THE WAY THE LAP BELT AND SHOULDER BELT HOOK TOGETHER CAUSE THEM TO TWIST WHICH ALLOWS THE SHOULDER BELT TO JAM IN THE RETURN GUIDE NOT ALLOWING THE BELT TO FULLY RETRACT AND HOLD PROPERLY.I HAVE BEEN WRITTEN UP FOR NOT WEARING MY BELT PROPERLY BUT THIS IS A BELT ISSUE AND A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN IF THE BELT WILL NOT FULLY RETRACT IT WILL NOT FULLY OPERATE IN A COLLISION. I HAVE SHOWED THIS TO A MANAGER AND ANOTHER WROTE ME UP FOR NOT WEARING IT PROPERLY.THIS NEVER OCCURS ON THE SEAT BELTS THAT ARE ONE PIECE AND CAN NOT TWIST.  *TR",
