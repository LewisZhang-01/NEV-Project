I COULD GO FORWARD OR BACKWARD, BUT COULD NOT TURN, OR COULD TURN ONLY VERY SLOWLY (I COULD HEAR THE WHEEL KIND OF MAKING CLICKING SOUND WHEN I TRIED TO TURN). AFTER DRIVING VERY SLOWLY ON THE PARKING LOT AND TRIED TO TURN SLOWLY SEVERAL TIME, THE STEERING FINALLY GOT BACK.  I GOOGLED ONLINE AND FOUND MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, MOSTLY WITH A DODGE, BUT ALSO SOME OTHER CARS.     HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/DODGE-GRAND-CARAVAN/TC37VJLP6MD4POHVJ    SINCE I DON'T DRIVE MUCH AND MOSTLY PARK MY VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE, I DON'T HAVE MUCH PROBLEM. IT HAS HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIMES AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT, BUT IT USUALLY RETURNS NORMAL AFTER I MAKE SEVERAL SMALL TURNS IN THE PARKING LOT. BUT THIS MORNING, IT HAPPENED AGAIN, AFTER I PARKED MY CAR OUTSIDE WITH AN OVERNIGHT RAIN, AND THE WHEEL WAS STILL KIND OF STUCK AFTER I DROVE ABOUT 5 MILES, MAKING SEVERAL TURNS ON PURPOSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S STILL POURING OUTSIDE, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET THE STEERING BACK TO NORMAL AFTER WORK.    SINCE I AM NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, I HOPE THE MANUFACTURER COULD HELP US SOLVE THE PROBLEM.    THANKS!",

I HAD IT REPAIRED THIS PAST TUES. AND GUESS WHAT YESTERDAY IT CAME OFF AGAIN (ALL OF 5 DAYS). I LOVE MY VEHICLE BUT I'M AFRAID OF IT. WHEN THE BELT COMES OFF EVERYTHING GOES OFF. LUCKILY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET OFF THE ROAD (SO FAR). LOOKED ON THE INTERNET AND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM. WHAT DOES IT TAKE -SOMEONE TO DIE BEFORE A RECALL WILL HAPPEN AND A SOLUTION?? THIS IS VERY COSTLY IN REPAIR BILLS/TOW BILLS AND SO FORTH. PLEASE DO SOMETHING.  *KB",

I GOT OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DANGEROUS PLACE ON THE OFF RAMP AND OIL WAS SPILLING OUT OF THE BOTTOM. WE HAD TO GET THE CAR TOWED. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT IT HAD TWO CRACKED HEADS. IF I HAD BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN THIS HAPPENED I WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT THIS AND I HAVE CALLED CHRYSLER AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT ALL THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE 2.7 LITER ENGINE. CHRYSLER SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS ENGINE OR THEY WOULD HAVE ISSUED A RECALL. EVERY PARTS PERSON, MECHANIC, DEALERSHIP, ETC. THAT I HAVE TALKED TO HAVE MENTIONED THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS ENGINE. IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYONE KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT CHRYSLER. THEY ASKED IF I HAD ALL THE RECORDS FROM EVERY TIME THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE OIL CHANGED. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD THINK ABOUT KEEPING. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING EVEN IF I HAD THE RECORDS. THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROOF. THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY COSTLY TO GET FIXED AND IF I PUT THE SAME KIND OF ENGINE IN, I AM LOOKING AT THE SAME PROBLEMS.

THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS EVEN COME OUT WITH A \"PATCH KIT\" BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCED MECHANICS RECOMMEND REMOVAL OF STRUTS AND WELDING NEW ONES IN PLACE. THIS IS A COSTLY FIX DUE TO BEING LABOR INTENSIVE. REGARDLESS... AFTER SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH DAIMLER CHRYSLER CONSUMER LINE, THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO REIMBURSE ME FOR FIXING THIS DEFECT OR FOR PATCHING IT. THEY DO NOT FEEL IT IS A RECALL ITEM AND APPARENTLY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE FRAME AS A SAFETY ISSUE. I WILL FIX MY VEHICLE AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THEIR LINE AGAIN SINCE THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO STAND BEHIND THE SAFETY/QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCT.

I WAS LUCKY IN BOTH CASES THAT I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING OR ANY ONE.  LANDERS EVENTUALLY  LOCATED THE PROBLEM, A FAULTY EVS MODULE.

MY BROTHER-IN-LAW PULLED THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD.  A FIRE ERUPTED AS SOON AS THE HOOD WAS OPENED.  A MINUTE OR SO LATER, ANOTHER FIRE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE ARRIVED AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.  THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED AWAY.  THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS SEVERLY DAMAGED, THE DASHBOARD WAS BADLY BURNED AND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAD A BIG HOLE IN IT.  BOTH THE FIREMAN AND THE POLICEMAN COMMENTED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE BATTERY MIGHT BE INVOLVED.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY THAT AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A COPY OF THE FIRE REPORT.  WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DODGE DEALER HERE IN HAWAII AND HE MADE THE SAME REMARK ABOUT THE BATTERY.  THE DODGE DEALER SAID THE JOB WAS TOO BIG FOR THEM TO HANDLE AND THEY WERE GOING TO CALL ANOTHER JOBBER TO LOOK AT IT.  I NEED SOME ADVICE ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT.  THIS VAN WAS CONVERTED FOR HANDICAP USE WITH A HYDRAULIC RAMP INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  THE VAN IS USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR MY SISTER WHO IS TOTALLY WHEELCHAIR AND BED BOUND, HAVING SUFFERED FOUR STROKES ON BOTH SIDES OF HER BODY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.  FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS NOT IN THE CAR AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.  PLEASE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE ON WHAT I SHOULD DO TO DETERMINE HOW THE FIRE STARTED AND WHETHER OR NOT THE MANUFACTURER IS AT FAULT FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE VAN.  WHO CAN CONDUCT A THOROUGH AND VALID INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT?  THERE WAS NO PRIOR INDICATION OF ANY IMPENDING FAILURES.  IN THIS DAY AND AGE, HOW CAN A CAR CATCH ON FIRE WITHOUT WARNING?

THE CENTER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE CROSS-SECTION EXHIBITED THE POROSITY.
