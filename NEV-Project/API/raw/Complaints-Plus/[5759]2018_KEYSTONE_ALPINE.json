I WAS INFORMED TO CHECK THE BOLTS FROM AN OWNER OF THE SAME YEAR AND MAKE CAMPER.  FORTUNATELY, I FOUND ONE STRIPPED READY TO FALL OFF, AND 4 LOOSE BEFORE MY NEXT TRIP.  UNFORTUNATELY HE LOST ONE OF THE BOLTS AND HIS AXEL COCKED SIDEWAYS AND WORE OUT HIS REAR SET OF TIRES.  I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION THE NUT THAT WAS STRIPPED.  THESE NUTS AND BOLTS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE SAFETY AND SUSPENTION OF THE TRAILER AND NEED TO BE PROPERLY TORQUED AND CHECKED BEFORE THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE ROAD.",

DUE TO ANOTHER MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, THAT POWER WIRE WAS PINCHED BETWEEN THE PIN BOX (5TH WHEEL HITCH) AND THE FIBERGLASS FRONT CAP OF THE TRAILER.  THE INSULATION ON THE WIRE CHAFED DURING TRAVEL DUE TO FLEXING AND EVENTUALLY SHORTED TO THE PIN BOX WHICH IS CHASSIS GROUND.  AS THE WIRE WAS NOT FUSED, IT GOT VERY HOT, MELTED THE INSULATION ON THE WIRE, AND MELTED TO OTHER WIRES IN THE LOOM. THERE WAS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR A VEHICLE FIRE. *TT  *TR  *TR",
