This rough shift often feels like a lurching forwards when it shifts from 1st to 2nd and from 2nd to 1st it feels like something hits me in the back and shoves me forward. The 1st to 2nd often makes me feel out of control of the vehicle and while it hasn't endangered anyone as of yet, I am concerned that it will push my into the car in front of me one day. The 2nd to 1st shift also causes me concern for how it may cause me a neck injury if I'm not always focused when I'm close to that shift point.  The problem has not be reproduced by a dealer or independent service center, though I do plan to take it when I have the time in the near future. The problem has not been inspected by anyone.
