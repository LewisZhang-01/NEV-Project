It is a safety issue because once broke, you can no longer put air into the tire. The first occurrence was while still under warranty and i had to argue with the Mazda dealer to replace it . The dealership gave me some sort of unofficial receipt which I actually kept, found, and attached to this complaint form. During my second set of tires, Sams Club graciously replaced 2 more as part of their tire warranty package (I dont think they documented this on their receipts). Now, what i believe to be the final OEM stem left has broke. Unfortunately, I have a third set of tires through Costco and they wont replace without a fee. This should be a safety recall absolutely no doubt in my experience!",

TOOK THE CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP (PAID THEIR SPECIAL SERVICE DIAGNOSTIC FEE OF  ($165+) WITH 'MASTER TECHNICIANS' WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS SEAT RECALL, YET, FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SEAT OR EVEN LOOKED IF YOU ASK ME, YET WANTED ME TO CORRECT THE NOISE BY BY INSTALLING BOTH FRONT AND REAR NEW SUSPENSION (~$1000).      TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A SUSPENSION SPECIALIST AND FOUND ONLY ONE (1) PART OF THE SUSPENSION THAT MAY HAVE REQUIRED CORRECTING BUT WAS STILL IN GOOD CONDITION. I ASKED IF THE REMAINING SUSPENSION COMPONENTS WERE SAFE AND IF THEY WOULD NEED REPLACEMENT.  AND THEY SAID'NO' ONLY ONE (1), AND IT WAS BARELY DAMAGED, BUT I REPLACED IT ANYWAY.  TOOK IT BACK FOR AN OIL CHANGE SINCE THEY WERE TREATING ME HONESTLY.  TWO DAYS LATER, AS I WAS LEAVING MY WORK, THE SEAT FELL OFF THE RIGHT RAIL AS I WAS DRIVING.  IN RETROSPECT, THE PUSH NUTS ON THE RIGHT SIDE POPPED OFF AND THE DRIVER'S SEAT BACK FRAME HAS LOST ITS INTEGRITY, SO I SAT ASKEW. UNABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY UNLESS A PIECE OF WOOD IS HOLDING THE SEAT TO THE RAIL.    IS IT POSSIBLE TO STILL REPAIR MY CAR'S DRIVER'S SEAT UNDER THE AFOREMENTIONED SAFETY RECALL?

USING A CODE READER, I CONSISTENTLY GET A CODE OF P0421, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE CATALYST EFFICIENCY IS BELOW THRESHOLD.  I HAVE HAD 3 AUTO REPAIR SHOPS LOOK AT MY CAR, AND THEY ALL SAY THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT MAZDA WARRANTS CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS/PZEV VEHICLES (WHICH MINE IS) FOR A PERIOD OF 15 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES ON ALL EMISSIONS RELATED COMPONENTS, THEY WILL NOT REPAIR MY CAR UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE I CURRENTLY DO NOT LIVE IN A STATE THAT USES CA EMISSIONS STANDARDS WHEN TESTING VEHICLE EMISSIONS.  I FEEL THAT SINCE MY CAR IS NOT PERFORMING AS IT WAS DESIGNED AND MAY BE RELEASING MY POLLUTANTS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER AT NO CHARGE TO ME, REGARDLESS OF WHERE I CURRENTLY LIVE.  IN ADDITION, WHEN I START THE CAR ON A COLD ENGINE, I CAN SMELL EXHAUST FUMES INSIDE THE CABIN, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE A LEAK AT THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD GASKET WHICH COULD BE DANGEROUS TO ANYONE DRIVING THE CAR IF THEY INHALE THE EXHAUST GASES THAT MAY ENTER THE PASSENGER AREA THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CONTINUES TO GO ON DAILY (UNLESS I RESET IT, AND THEN IT GOES BACK ON AGAIN LATER AFTER DRIVING) AND MY CAR WILL NOT PASS ITS NEXT EMISSIONS INSPECTION WITHOUT THIS ISSUE BEING FIXED.",

THIS IS HAPPENING QUITE OFTEN SO I HAD TO SWITCH TO NORMAL DRIVE MODE( D) ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE ABS, TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT WOULD TURN ON AFTER MAKING A QUICK LEFT OR RIGHT TURN BUT THIS HAPPEN ONLY A FEW TIME, THE ONLY WAY TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF WAS TO PARK SOMEWHERE SAFE AND TURN THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON TO REMOVE THE LIGHTS. NOW IT'S SUMMER TIME AN THIRD PROBLEM HAS APPEAR, FOR SOME RANDOM REASON AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM IS GOING CRAZY AND BLOWING HOT AIR INSTEAD OF COLD AIR IN THE CRAZY TEXAS SUMMER HEAT, WHAT'S EVEN MORE CRAZY IS DRIVER SIDE BLOW EXTREMELY HOT AIR AND PASSENGER SIDE BLOW HOT AIR BUT AT A LOWER DEGREES. SOMETIME EVEN SMELLING A SMOKY BURNING PLASTIC SMELL.   I FIND IT EXTREMELY UNSAFE FOR A CAR TO HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE SHIFTING AND CAUSING THE CAR TO LAG IN SHIFTING GEAR PROPERLY WHICH CAUSE TO JERK IN MOVING TRAFFIC WHICH CAN CAUSE A ACCIDENT. TO ADD EVEN ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL MIGHT HAVE ISSUES WHICH SCARES ME EVEN MORE. NOW EVEN HOT AIR WITH MAYBE A BURNING PLASTIC SMELL.     CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHECK PROPERLY BUT THESE DRIVING WITH THESE UNSAFE ISSUES CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS AND EVEN WORST DEATH IF NOT CHECK PROPERLY. MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IN A CAR IS IT'S ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND STOP PROPERLY, WITHOUT THOSE, IT BECOMES A DANGEROUS OBJECT ON THE ROAD.",

THE TPMS SENSORS ON THE MAZDA 3 ARE CONNECTED TO THE AIR VALVE IN THE TIRES. TPMS SENSORS ARE VERY FICKLE AND TEND TO CORRODE AND BREAK WITH SEASONAL WEATHER. WHEN THE TPMS SENSOR BREAKS ON A MAZDA3, IT LETS ALL THE AIR OUT OF YOUR TIRE AND GIVES YOU A FLAT, STRANDING YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE.  TPMS SENSORS ARE SUPPOSED TO AID DRIVERS TO LET THEM KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT IN THIS CASE, THEY ACTUALLY CAUSE THE PROBLEM. THE AIR VALVE BEING CONNECTED TO THE TPMS IS UNIQUE TO THE DESIGN OF THIS CAR, AND HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME WITH OTHER VEHICLES.   THIS CAN LEAD TO DANGEROUS SITUATIONS, DEPENDING ON HOW FAST THE CAR IS TRAVELING AND WHERE.  I HAVE LOST AIR ON THE HIGHWAY AND BEEN STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. TPMS SENSORS/INSTALLATION ARE 200 BUCKS EACH APPROXIMATELY, AND IF YOUR TIRE GETS RIPPED UP DURING THE INCIDENT, YOU MUST ALSO BUY A NEW TIRE.   *TR",

MY ADVISOR CALLED LATER THAT AFTERNOON TO SAY THAT HIS MANAGER STATED THAT BECAUSE MY CAR WAS \"OUT OF WARRANTY\", IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE THE DASHBOARD AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1000 OUT OF POCKET! THEY WERE NOT ACCOMMODATING AT ALL. THIS IS COMPLETELY LUDICROUS! CARS SHOULD NOT MELT! MY DASHBOARD IS TOTALLY RUINED! I CAN NEVER AGAIN EVEN WIPE IT OFF AS IT HAS LITERALLY TURNED INTO THE CONSISTENCY OF FLYPAPER! THE MELTED, STICKY, MESS GETS ON/RUINS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES! AND, THIS ISN'T EVEN THE WORST PART! THE GLARE THAT RADIATES OFF OF MY WINDSHIELD AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY IS HORRIFIC! DRIVING IS A TOTAL SAFETY HAZARD!! I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR! IT'S SO DANGEROUS! I HAVE PICTURES I CAN SEND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM! I FIND THIS TO BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! WARRANTY OR NOT, THIS IS A BLATANT DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THIS CAR! MY LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL HAS DONE AN INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE AND THE LAST I HEARD, LAWYERS ARE GETTING INVOLVED AND THEY HAD MENTIONED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MAZDA, LEXUS, AND NISSAN. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS IS NOT A RARE INCIDENT! THIS IS A HUGE, PREVALENT PROBLEM! NOT TO MENTION, THE VALUE OF MY CAR IS NOW IN THE TOILET! IF I WENT TO TRADE IT IN OR SELL IT, EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY HAS 59,000 MILES, I WOULD TAKE A HUGE HIT ON WHAT I WOULD GET FOR IT! THIS IS A DEFECT! MAZDA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY NEED TO BE FORCED TO REPLACE ALL OF THESE DEFECTS (USING NEW, UPDATED DASHBOARD MATERIAL SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN), AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER, BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED BECAUSE OF THE GLARE ISSUE CAUSED BY THIS!  *TR",

THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO A SHEET METAL PIECE (APPROXIMATELY 1/8 INCH THICK) THAT HOLDS THE SEAT BOTTOM TO THE SEAT SLIDE ADJUSTMENT.  THE SPRING RETAINER HAD POPPED OFF THE LOCATING PIN ALLOWING THE SHEET METAL TO BEND AND THE PIN TO COME OUT OF ITS RETAINING HOLE.  I ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE THE SPRING RETAINER, BUT THE SHEET METAL SNAPPED DUE TO WORK HARDENING.  THE FAILURE MECHANISM APPEARS TO OCCUR BECAUSE THE SHEET METAL IS STAMPED DURING MANUFACTURE AND A HOLE APPROXIMATELY 1/2 THE WIDTH OF THE SHEET METAL IS PUNCHED THROUGH THE  SHEET METAL DRASTICALLY REDUCING ITS STRENGTH.    I PURCHASED A NEW SLIDE MECHANISM BECAUSE MAZDA DOES NOT HAVE A RECALL OR SPECIAL SERVICE PROGRAM FOR THIS FAILURE.  HOWEVER, WHEN I EXAMINED THE NEW SLIDE MECHANISM, I DISCOVERED THAT MAZDA HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDESIGNED THIS PART TO PREVENT THE TYPE OF FAILURE THAT I EXPERIENCED.  THE NEW PIECE DOES NOT HAVE THE PUNCHED HOLE, BUT INSTEAD HAS A REINFORCED BOSS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WELDING TO ENSURE THE PIECE CANNOT BEND OR BREAK.  MY GUESS IS THAT THE NEW DESIGN IS AT LEAST 100 TIMES MORE DURABLE THAN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN.      OBVIOUSLY, MAZDA CONSIDERED THE OLD DESIGN TO BE SUBSTANDARD.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A RECALL TO VERIFY THAT THE SEAT RETENTION HAS NOT FAILED.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE FAILURE RESULTS IN ONLY 3 POINTS OF RETENTION FOR THE SEAT AND THE DRIVER CAN POSSIBLY LOSE CONTROL DUE TO IMPROPER RESTRAINT IN THE SEAT.  I CAN SUPPLY PICTURES OF THE NEW DESIGN AND DEFECTIVE DESIGN IF YOU NEED THEM. THERE ARE TWO SUCH PIECES PER SEAT SO THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR BOTH TO FAIL IN SEQUENCE CREATING A MORE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",

THE CLUTCH ON THE 2010 MAZDA3 IS ONLY COVERED FOR 7500 MILES. THAT'S SUSPICIOUS IN AND OF ITSELF.     SO HERE'S MY STORY, MY CLUTCH GAVE OUT AFTER 50,000 MILES. NO WARNING OR ANYTHING. THE MECHANIC I TOOK IT TO SAID IN THE 32 YEARS HE'S BEEN FIXING CLUTCHES, HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO HORRIFIC. HE HAD TO HAVE METAL FABRICATORS COME IN AND MAKE PARTS BECAUSE SOME OF THE SURROUNDING EQUIPMENT WAS SO WARPED.    MAZDA CLAIMS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FAULTY PRODUCT. I'VE READ STORIES ONLINE WHERE PEOPLE REPORT THEIR CLUTCH BLOWING OUT AT 14,000 MILES. EDMUNDS.COM, A LEADER IN CAR RESOURCES RATES THE CLUTCH PROBLEM ON THIS SPECIFIC CAR AT A 9.7/10.    IT'S A FAULTY PART IN A CAR AND MAZDA WILL NOT EVEN CONSIDER IT TO BE AN ACTUAL THING. IT'S NOT RIGHT AT ALL.  *TR",

I AM NOW BEING FORCED TO PAY $1100 TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH, BECAUSE THEY SAY MY WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. I ASKED HOW A COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED CLUTCH PAD IS \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\" ON A VEHICLE WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN DRIVEN 16K MILES! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS HAD IT FAILED COMPLETELY WHILE DRIVING! I FILED A CLAIM WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. I ALSO CALLED THE MAZDA CORPORATE OFFICE FOR ASSISTANCE, WHERE I WAS TOLD I COULD SIMPLY VOICE A COMPLAINT. \"TOM\" REFUSED TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR OR ANYONE HIGHER THAN HIMSELF (HE WAS JUST A CALL-CENTER EMPLOYEE). HE OFFERED TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP AND ASK THEM TO PROVIDE ME WITH A DISCOUNT. WHEN I SPOKE TO THE DEALER TODAY, THEY SAID TOM DID CALL THEM, BUT NEVER ASKED FOR ANY DISCOUNTS! ALL HE DID WAS EXPLAIN THAT MAZDA HAS NOT RECALLED THE CLUTCH, SO MY WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER THE NECESSARY REPLACEMENT. MAZDA SOLD ME A SUB-PAR VEHICLE, AND NOW THEY LIED ABOUT THEIR WAY OF HANDLING THE ERROR. I LOOKED ONLINE AND HAVE FOUND SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON THE SAME VEHICLE CLAIMING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS ON A LOW-MILEAGE CLUTCH. THIS CLEARLY IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, NOT DRIVER ERROR. IT SHOULD BE RECALLED AS THE PROBLEM IS SO COMMON IN THIS EXACT MAKE AND MODEL WITH SUCH LOW MILES. $1100 LATER AND I GET A NEW SHODDY CLUTCH WHICH I WILL HAVE TO REPLACE IN ANOTHER 16K MILES.

I WAS DRIVING TO WORK LAST WEEK, AND NOTICED SOMETHING WITH THE CAR FELT OFF.  EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE, SO I FINALLY BROUGHT IT TO MY MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME, AS I SUSPECTED, THAT THE CLUTCH WAS SLIPPING AND NEARING THE END OF ITS LIFE.  I HAVE YET TO REPLACE THE BRAKE PADS ON THIS CAR, AND TO GET TOLD THAT THE CLUTCH IS GONE BEFORE I EVEN REPLACE NORMAL MAINTENANCE ITEMS IS JUST FLAT OUT UNACCEPTABLE.  I HAVE HAD TWO PREVIOUS CARS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, AND NEVER REPLACED A CLUTCH, EVEN WHEN THEY HAD CLOSE TO 100,000 MILES ON THEM.    MY MECHANIC SUGGESTED BEFORE I DO ANYTHING, TO LOOK ON FORUMS AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH PREMATURE CLUTCH WEAR.  I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE WEEKEND ON MAZDA AND EDMUNDS FORUMS READING ABOUT COUNTLESS PEOPLE WITH MY MODEL YEAR, 2010, WHO HAVE HAD CLUTCHES GO BEFORE 35,000 MILES.

I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE CAR EXAMINING THE DAMAGE - WHITE PAINT FROM THE BUILDING AND A SLIGHT PUCK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BUMPER. THE MAN LOOKED AT ME INCREDULOUSLY BECAUSE HE SAID THE IMPACT SHOOK THESHOP . HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN AND IT TOOK HIM A FEW MINUTES TO CLOSE IT. A WOMAN CAME OUT ALSO BECAUSE SHE FELT THE IMPACT IN THE SHOP NEXT TO THE MAN'S SHOP. THERE WERE NO WITNESSES TO MY ACCELERATION PROBLEM. I DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE A POLICE OFFICER (IT'S DETROIT). AFTER LUNCH, I DROVE BACK HOME AND SENT MAZDA AN EMAIL. I HEARD FROM MAZDA FRIDAY MORNING. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER IN TROY. I SPOKE TO AMIR ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND TOLD HIM THAT THE CAR WAS ON ITS WAY INTO THE DEALERSHIP (BY THE WAY, I EVEN HAVE MY OIL CHANGE AT THE DEALERSHIP). WHEN THE CAR ARRIVED I RECEIVED A CALL FROM SCOTT BRYANT WHO, IN AN ACCUSATORY MANNER ASKED ME TO REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED DESPITE AMIR TELLING HIM MY STORY. HE WARNED ME THAT IT WILL TAKE ALL AFTERNOON TO LOOK AT THE CAR. SCOTT CALLED LATER TO INFORM ME THAT A FIELD ENGINEER WILL BE COMING IN ON MONDAY TO LOOK AT THE CAR. HE DID NOT OFFER ME A RENTAL. *TR",
