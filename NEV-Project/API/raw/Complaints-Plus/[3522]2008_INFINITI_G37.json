I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN ON SLOW MOVING, LIGHTLY USED ROAD, OR ELSE THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. I MANAGED TO PUSH THE CAR OFF INTO A DESIGNATED PARKING AREA AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE CAR TO NO AVAIL. IN US LAW, ENDANGERING COMPRISES SEVERAL TYPES OF CRIMES INVOLVING CONDUCT THAT IS WRONGFUL AND RECKLESS OR WANTON, AND LIKELY TO PRODUCE DEATH OR GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM TO ANOTHER PERSON. FROM THIS EXPERIENCE AND READING OF SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, I AM SURPRISED NISSAN/INFINITI HAVE NOT RECALLED THESE CARS FOR OBVIOUS ENDANGERMENT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THE WELFARE OF OTHER DRIVERS. THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CLUTCH SLAVE CYLINDERS (CSC) HAS OCCURRED COUNTLESS TIMES, PUTTING LIVES IN DANGER. IF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AT THE NISSAN/INFINITI DEALERSHIPS STATE THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THESE CARS, WHY HAS NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC. NOT DONE SOMETHING TO RECTIFY THIS? *TR",
