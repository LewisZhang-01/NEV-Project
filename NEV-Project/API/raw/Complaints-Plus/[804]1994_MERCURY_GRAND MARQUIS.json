I HAVE READ ONLINE OF OTHER GRAND MARQUIS' AND  FORD CROWN VICTORIA'S DOING THE SAME THING.THIS WAS ONLY MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE LIGHTS. I HAVE OWNED THE CAR SINCE JAN 23,2013 AND THE LIGHTS CONTINUE TO DO THIS THEREFORE I CANNOT DRIVE IT AT NIGHT. THE CAR IS ALL ORIGINAL NO AFTERMARKET NOTHING BUT A CD PLAYER. LIGHTS WERE DOING THIS BEFORE I INSTALLED THE CD PLAYER. SO AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE I PULLED THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF ONLY TO FIND THAT THE FACTORY WIRING HARNESS THAT PLUGS INTO THE BACK OF THE LIGHT SWITCH HAD MELTED WHERE THE POSITIVE BATTERY WIRE SLOT IS.SO I REPLACED THE HARNESS WITH A BRAND NEW ONE,AND NOTHING.LIGHTS STILL GO OUT. A COUPLE WEEKS LATER I TOOK THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF AGAIN TO FIND THE NEW WIRING HARNESS I HAD JUST BOUGHT 2 WEEKS PRIOR MELTED JUST LIKE THE ONE FROM THE FACTORY, SAME WIRE SLOT. SO NOW I HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY ANOTHER ONE. I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE BATTERY AND THE AUTO LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE TOO THAT DIDNT FIX ANYTHING EITHER.IM GOING TO TRY A NEW HEADLIGHT SWITCH AND A NOTHER NEW HARNESS TOO. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL FIX IT.BUT UNTIL I GET THE MONEY TO FIX ONE OF FORD/MERCURY'S MOST ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS I WONT BE DRIVING IT AT NIGHT. BUT REALLY THIS CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FORD SHOULD HAVE TO FIX THIS. GRAND MARQUIS AND CROWN VICS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEIR LIGHT SYSTEMS FAILING ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THEY QUIT MAKING THEM IN 2011. WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS ON 1/23/2013 I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT MINE, THEY JUST ARE NOT SAFE.  *TR",

I WENT HOME POPPED THE HOOD OF THE CAR AND STARTED LOOKING FOR A BAD FUSE. I FOUND IT IN THE CAR COMPARTMENT NOT UNDER THE HOOD. LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD AND SAW SMOKE I JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR AND SAW WHERE THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM AND TORE THE WIRES FROM THE SWITCH. I WENT TO A FORD DEALER AND HE SAID IT IS NOT COVERED. WRONG YEAR. THIS IS THE SAME SWITCH THAT HAS CAUSED FIRES THAT BURNED DOWN HOMES AND HAS CAUSED DEATHS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT FORD HAS NOT INCLUDED ALL OF THE CARS THAT HAVE THESE DEFECTIVE SWITCH'S. I OWN 1 OF THIS MODEL. MY FATHER- IN- LAW OWNS 1 ALSO. HIS CRUISE CONTROL WENT BAD 2 YEARS AGO. IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. IT JUST NEVER CAUGHT ON FIRE. I DISCONNECTED THE SOLENOID IN THE STEERING COLUMN SO IT WOULD SHIFT. HE TOLD ME AFTER I GOT IT RUNNING THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WOULD NOT WORK ANYMORE. I NEVER LOOKED FOR THE BAD FUSE. SO HERE IS 2 CARS SAME YEAR SAME MAKE SAME PROBLEM. THERE IS A LARGER PROBLEM THAN FORD IS SAYING. I COULD OF LOST MY CAR AND HOUSE BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. FORD WANTS ME TO PAY TO HAVE THIS FIXED AND NOT COVER IT. HOW MANY MORE OF THESE CARS ARE WAITING TO GO UP IN FLAMES. HOW MANY MORE DEATHS AND HOMES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THIS ALL GETS FIXED. *JB",
