THE ROCK HIT WAS BARLEY AUDIBLE, ALMOST DIDN'T NOTICE IT.  WHEN I GOT TO WORK I INSPECTED IT AND FOUND THE SLIGHTEST SCRATCH, NO CHIP, NOT ANY SIGNS OF A CRACK.  SO I DIDN'T WORRY  ABOUT IT.  WHEN I GOT IN MY CAR AT LUNCH NOTICED A CRACK FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF WINDSHIELD.  I CAN TAKE MY FINGERNAIL AND FEEL THE CRACK ON BOTH SIDES.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO ON ROAD TRIPS,  STOP AND GET YOUR GLASS REPLACED EVERY TIME YOU GET A CHIP.  I DO NOT FEEL THIS CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE WHEN THE WINDSHIELD IS CRACKED FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  NOT TO MENTION YOU CAN GET A TICKET OR TOLD TO PARK THE CAR WHEN IT IS IN THE DRIVERS VIEW!  *TR",
