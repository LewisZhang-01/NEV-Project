Taking it to a Mazda dealership i learned the headlight assembly unit was melting.  I had to purchase 2 used headlight assembly because new from the dealership are 1,000 a piece.   2 used but perfectly working headlights were installed and within a yr the headlights had burned out again.  I went to change the bulbs only to learn the headlight assembly were once again burnt.  I have to purchase 2 new headlight assembly again but the mechanic can not guarantee that this burning situation won't occur.   After calling around to places to find headlight assembly I have come to find out many are burnt.    This seems like a real problem considering you need headlights to drive at night.   Spending 1,000 everytime my headlights burn out seems 100% unreasonable and the fact that there is cleary a wiring issue within the headlight assembly unit itself seems to be a problem.  I have been on multiple forums and this is a common issue.   Please fix the problem!!!!!!",

I CAN CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION UPON REQUEST BUT I WANTED TO ADD TO THE ON-GOING INVESTIGATION THAT HEAVY CORROSION TO THE POINT OF ME QUESTIONING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF SAID SUBFRAME IS FOR SURE AN ISSUE I'M EXPERIENCING.    I HAVE NOT CHECKED THE WELDS TO THE VARIOUS SUSPENSION COMPONENTS ATTACHED TO SUB FRAME BUT THE PINCH WELDS ALONG THE INTERIOR EDGE OF THE SUB FRAME HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED ALLOWING THE INGRESS OF ADDITIONAL WATER WHICH I BELIEVE IS ACCELERATING THIS ISSUE. THE WHOLE LOWER SURFACE OF THE SUB FRAME TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE SUB FRAME HAS BEGUN CORRODING AS WELL AND THE PAINT COVERING THE SUB FRAME HAS BUBBLED UP OR SEPARATED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CORROSION.",

IN AUGUST WE TOOK THE CAR TO JENKINS MAZDA IN OCALA WHERE WE BOUGHT IT. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO EXPEDITE THE REPLACEMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.IN SEPTEMBER THE REPLACEMENT STILL HAD NOT COME SO THEY ASKED US TO STORE THE CAR WITH THEM. OUR CAR WAS THERE AT THE JENKINS MAZDA CAR LOT FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS.   WE DID NOT USE THE CAR BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. AAA CAME TO THE HOUSE AND TESTED THE BATTERY AND THEY CONCLUDED THAT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT USED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THE BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, WE NOTICED THAT THE NAVIGATION SCREEN WAS GIVING A MESSAGE ?A PROGRAM CANNOT BE READ. PLEASE CONSULT DEALER.? WE CALLED [XXX] AND THEY SAID COMEBACK AND WHILE REPLACING THE AIR BAG PART THEY WOULD FIX THE NAVIGATION SCREEN.ON JANUARY 17 2017 THE PART WAS REPLACED, BUT THEY COULDN?T FIX THE NAVIGATION SCREEN.

I FORGOT TO MENTION IN THE PREVIOUS COMPLAINT THAT THE MELTING PASSENGER DASHBOARD IS ACTUALLY NOT A TRUE DASHBOARD, IT IS AN AIRBAG FOR THE FRONT PASSENGER.  I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE MELTING, PERMANENT,  EXTREMELY STIKY, SEMI LIQUID EXTERIOR OF THE AIRBAG WILL FAIL TO RUPTURE PROPERLY ALLOWING FOR NORMAL DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAG. IT MAY RUPTURE TOO EASILY CAUSING DEPLOYMENT OF AIRBAG WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE, POSSIBLY BREAKING THE NECK OF A CHILD OR INJURING AN ADULT. IT COULD NOT RUPTURE COMPLETELY CAUSING A LAG IN THE TIME OF DEPLOYMENT AND MAY NOT INFLATE COMPLETELY. IT COULD ALSO POSSIBLY PREVENT DEPLOYMENT COMPLETELY.  IN ADDITION TO CAUSING DEFECTS IN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT BLINDNESS OR EYE INJURY AS WELL AS SKIN INJURY CAN OCCUR AT TIME OF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION OF THE STIKY LIQUIDATED AIRBAG SURFACE SPRAYING INTO THE FACE, EYES, AND MOUTH OF PASSENGERS. THE LIQUIFYING AIRBAG SURFACE MIGHT ALSO LEAK INTO INTERNAL AIRBAG COMPONENTS CAUSING MALFUNCTION. REMER THAT WHEN SOMEONE REFERS TO THE PASSENGER SIDE DASHBOARD MELTING, IT IS ACTUALLY THE SURFACE OF THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG.

AS I GET OFF THE FREEWAY, THE CAR STARTS TO LOSE MORE POWER, THE FUEL ACCELERATION DID NOT WORK AS WELL AND THE STEERING BECAME VERY HARD BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE POWER STEERING FLUID. THEN AS I START TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT THERE IS SMOKE COMING FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE CLOSED HOOD. I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, TURN OFF THE ACCELERATION, AND POP THE HOOD AND I NOTICED IT IS ON FIRE. I RAN FROM CAR AND CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE, THE CAR IS TOTALED. I AM NOT SURE WHAT COMPONENTS MALFUNCTIONED IN THE CAR WHICH INSURANCE IS DETERMINING AT THE MOMENT.
