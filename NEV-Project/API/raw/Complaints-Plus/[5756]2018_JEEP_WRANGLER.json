She informed that she hit a pothole in the road at the high speed and the car began to shake.  The history of this vehicle when I leased it new was the same.  After having leased the vehicle for less than a year, I experienced the same.  At that time there was a recall on the steering stabilizer (believe that was the name).  I took it back to the dealership and it appeared to be resolved.  I had not experienced the problem again until recently.  I just took it to the dealership explaining the problem.  They informed me that the steering damper design was outdated and performed a bleed out.  After driving the vehicle, I experienced the same problem (traveling @ a speed of 65+ and hit an imperfection in the road).  I believe that may daughter or I could lose control of the vehicle if traveling on the beltway and the vehicle shakes uncontrollably; thus, there's a lost of control of the vehicle which will cause a crash.",

When I attempted to steer back left to correct the vehicle straight, I was unable to move the steering wheel at all to the left resulting in me driving into a mailbox & damaged both vehicle & mailbox. Vehicle drove home fine w/out further steering issue and problem couldn't be replicated.  1/11/22: Another cold morning(appr 32 degrees), warmed car up for 15 mins(to take kids to school). Came to a 30 degree left turn & again noticed the same issue of steering locked up and unable to turn left into curve until I used both hands/arms to apply a significant amount of physical force(again barely missing a mailbox). Then I couldn't correct back to the right w/out applying same force so ended up in oncoming lane of traffic. Thankfully there was not an oncoming vehicle since I had 2 kids in the car & could've had a head on collision. Steering started working again before vehicle even came to a stop. 1/27/21: Cold morning again, warmed car up as usual, & had the same steering failure on same left hand curve as on 1/11 but this time steering ability returned quickly and safely made through the turn. Oncoming vehicle but steering returned quickly enough to avoid issues. I've since learned that FCA has a new 'campaign' out for the steering assist categorized as a 'non-safety related' repair. I'm uncertain if the 'software update' will address my steering issue as the factors outlined in it are not the same as my circumstance & correspond with a different issue being reported with the steering.?",

I was told that they had a recall on that 2 years and 3 months ago, and since the 2 year warranty expired, there was nothing they could do about it.  If a recall doesn't work, then isn't the dealership still required to fix a manufacturer defect?  My Jeep had an additional recall, which the dealership performed last week, and  the dealership thought this new recall (computer update) might fix the death wobble problem.  When I picked up my Jeep last week after this second recall, my heat and A/C no longer worked--all controls on the Jeep no longer worked.  The dealership said they just followed the procedure in the recall, and since the recall resulted in the loss of my heat, A/C and defrosting, that I needed to deal with Jeep USA.  I have submitted my case to Customer Care (FCA US, LLC) at Jeep USA, and they are telling me they might be able to ship a part in 6 weeks.  My car has no heater.  No accountability.

I haven't found a common culprit, though it's been triggered by hitting bridge expansion joints on the highway... particularly if I'm not going perfectly straight.  I'm fearful of driving over 55 MPH, and I don't think that's acceptable. While I kept control, I don't know if that will always happen.  I fear losing control and possibly rolling over.

This has almost caused me to crash into other vehicles and/or structures as I can not maintain my lane, with my *child* in the vehicle.  Colder weather seems to make this worse.  Also, there is excessive play and extremely loose steering while driving, the vehicle will not maintain a straight line, the driver must constantly micro manage the steering wheel.   No warning lamps or messages. I have not taken it to the dealership because they want to charge over $100 for a diagnostic fee. I should not have to pay this charge as this is a known SAFETY issue.  There is a recall for this issue on others with the same year, make & model but my VIN is not included in this.

At one point the touch screen started to self dial SOS and would not respond to the initial attempts to hang up, causing the driver to be distracted and almost cause a collision.

She was told it just needed an oil change and it was safe to drive. About 10 days later my wife was driving the vehicle and the same thing happened. The vehicle was taken to our local dealer where they tried to diagnose, unable to duplicate the problem it was returned to us. We returned about 10 days later same lights coming on, this time power steering was lost. Dealership worked with Chrysler engineering and determined that the ABS module needed replaced. Work completed and Jeep was picked up. About 10 days later dash warning lights on, speedometer display out, power steering lost, back to dealership. Unable to look at at that time appointment made and returned. It is now September 30th we have cases opened with Chrysler and Mopar Warrantee. Vehicle is still at the dealership, diagnosis is now a $2000.00 chaffed wiring harness just outside the fuse box not covered by anybody. No guarantee that this will fix it. Neither will put anything in writing. I have tried to be patient, we need our vehicle. I do not feel that my family  or others are safe when it pertains to this vehicle.

I received an oil change + inspection from a dealership and nothing was found. This same problem happened again in a parking lot, (ABS, check engine, car not turning on) and I took my car to the dealership for service. They performed an inspection and I was told the ABS module needed to be replaced. About a week later I picked up my car from the dealership after they told me they fixed the issue and my car was good to go. THE SAME DAY, I had the same problem except this time it was significantly worse and extremely dangerous for myself and others. This time, WHILE driving my \"serviced\" vehicle, the ABS light, check engine light came on, dashboard stopped working, and the steering wheel also had locked while DRIVING and I was unable to turn.  I was extremely terrified and I immediately pulled the car over. After multiple attempts to start the car (same issue as before: car would not start, ABS/check engine light) I promptly took the vehicle to the dealership again. The dealership is charging me again for another inspection, hours after their service? It seems that they are using this as an opportunity to make money, rather than actually fix the issue with the vehicle. This should not be about money, this is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. The service the dealership has provided not only endangered my life, but the lives of others around me. I am extremely fortunate that this did not happen on the freeway. The dealer did not fix the problem, and in fact made the car dangerous with some of these new issues, the steering wheel locking up and the disabled dashboard.

IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE VEHICLE IS DRIVING ON ICE, AND IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE TO MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT TRACK.  THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD NO MODIFICATIONS OTHER THAN WHEELS AND TIRES, AND THE PROBLEM EXISTED WITH THE OEM WHEELS AND TIRES.  NO SUSPENSION OR LIFT KIT, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS VEHICLE AND IT HAS APPROXIMATELY 20K MILES ON IT.  PLEASE HELP US!",

WHILE DRIVING AT 45MPH OR ABOVE, I CAN TURN THE WHEEL ALMOST A FULL INCH IN EITHER DIRECTION AND THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND AT ALL. THERE OTHER DAY I WAS ON A HIGHWAY WITH UNEVEN PAVEMENT AND HAD TO SLOW DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT CONTROL THE CAR.    JEEP HAS NOW ISSUED A TSB REPLACING THE ALUMINUM BOX WITH A STEEL BOX. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVING THIS TSB PERFORMED STATE IT FIXES THE STEERING. I TOOK MY JEEP INTO MY DEALERSHIP 3 WEEKS AGO, WHILE HAVING JEEPCARES, THE NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR FCA, INVOLVED FROM THE START.    FIRST THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE I HAD AN \"AFTERMARKET\" LIFT. WHEN I TOLD THEN THE LIFT WAS NOT AFTERMARKET AND IS MOPAR, THEY DEMANDED A RECEIPT TO PROVE IT. I BOUGHT THE LIFT OVER 1.5 YEARS AGO SO NO LONGER HAD A RECEIPT. THE ISSUE WAS ESCALATED UP THE CORPORATE LADDER MULTIPLE TIMES UNTIL THEY FINALLY AGREED TO REPLACE THE STEERING BOX UNDER WARRANTY. THERE HAD BEEN INSTANCES OF JEEP OWNERS COMING IN FOR THIS TSB BUT DEALERSHIPS WERE NOT REPLACING THE STEERING BOX WITH THE STEEL VERSION PER THE TSB, JUST PUTTING IN ANOTHER ALUMINUM BOX. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.     THE MAIN POINT OF THIS IS THIS STEERING ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE A RECALL. THE DEALERSHIPS ARE PUTTING FORTH EVERY EFFORT NOT TO DO THE WORK. AND THE PROBLEM IS SO BAD THAT FCA IS ONLY LETTING DEALERSHIPS ORDER 1 STEERING BOX PER WEEK, DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF JEEPS WITH DANGEROUS STEERING AND DEMAND FOR THE PART.

I HAD THE SUSPENSION CHECKED WHEN I WENT IN FOR THE SECOND WELD RECALL NOTICE ON MY JEEP IN 01/19, IT WAS OK ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP.  02/19 I EXPERIENCED EXCESSIVE VIBRATION/SHUTTERING OF THE FRONTEND AFTER HITTING A BUMP AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. DID NOT STOP UNTIL I SLOWED TO ABOUT 40MPH. TOOK TO DEALERSHIP, AN UPGRADED STEERING DAMPENER WAS PLACED ON THE VEHICLE. SHUTTERING CONTINUED.   10/19 SHUTTERING GETS WORSE. WHILE DRIVING ABOUT 55MPH STEERING LOCKS UP ON A CURVE TWO TIMES, LIKE THE POWER STEERING DROPPED FOR A COUPLE SECONDS THEN RETURNED. TAKEN TO THE SHOP, DAMPENER REPLACED AGAIN, CANT DUPLICATE LOCK UP.   I CONTACTED JEEP CARES AND FCA.   11/19 VEHICLE IS TAKEN TO THE SHOP AGAIN FOR 2 WEEKS. SHOP ACKNOWLEDGES STEERING IS LOOSER THAN IT SHOULD BE. STEERING GEAR IS REPLACED.   AFTER GETTING VEHICLE BACK STEERING IS TIGHT BUT NOW WANDERING ALL OVER THE PLACE, CANT KEEP JEEP IN A STRAIGHT LINE ESPECIALLY AT HIGH SPEED.   12/19 VEHICLE IS TAKEN BACK TO SHOP ALIGNMENT IS PERFORMED.  AFTER A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES I NOTICE STEERING IS LOOSE AND THERE IS A DEAD SPOT IN THE STEERING AGAIN. I RELAY THIS TO FCA.   01/19 FCA REGIONAL TECH DRIVES VEHICLE, SAYS ITS DRIVING AS DESIGNED, CHECKS ALIGNMENT AND ADJUSTS CASTER.   PROBLEMS WITH LOOSE STEERING AND DEADSPOT PERSIST. JEEPS DEGREE OF WANDERING DEPENDS ON CONDITIONS SEEMS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO OPERATE ON WINDY DAYS THAN IT WAS BEFORE STEERING GEAR CHANGE. TAKES CONSTANT CORRECTIONS TO KEEP IT GOING STRAIGHT.",

FROM THERE THEY TRIED TO REPLICATE THE STEERING PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT SO I WAS LEFT WITH NO ANSWERS.

I SHOULDNT HAVE TO BUY A VEHICLE & JUST ACCEPT A DEATH WOBBLE AS PART OF THE OWNERSHIP, ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING & WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ISSUE. ALL I WANT IS IT FIXED THAT IS ALL & I SHOULDNT HAVE TO FORK OUT THE MONEY TO GET THAT DONE.",

THE VEHICLE WOULD ENTER A VIOLENT LEFT-TO-RIGHT SHAKING EVIDENCED BY A STEERING WHEEL THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO RETAIN A GRIP ON, TERRIFIED PASSENGERS, AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES DUE TO HAVING TO SLOW TO APPROXIMATELY 35-45 MPH TO ALLOW THE VIBRATIONS TO SUBSIDE AND CONTROL TO BE REGAINED. ON DAILY COMMUTES ON THE FREEWAY (110 N, 405, I5, 10E) THIS WOULD OCCUR ROUTINELY 3-6 TIMES. TWO JEEP DEALERSHIPS (DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, AND SCOTT ROBINSON IN TORRANCE [BOTH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIPS]) WERE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE FIRST REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, AND THE SECOND WAS NON-RESPONSIVE TO REQUEST FOR HELP.",

THE REPAIR SHOP TOLD ME THE CAR HAD THROWN OVER 100 CODES BUT NONE WERE ACTIVE. THEY KEPT MY JEEP FOR 10 DAYS AND TOLD ME THEY TOOK IT APART AND CHECKED EVERYTHING. I WAS TOLD BECAUSE NO ISSUES WERE CURRENT THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM THOUGH.I PICKED IT UP AND NOT 8 MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED. THIS TIME HOWEVER I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHERE I WAS ALMOST HIT AND BECAUSE I HAD NO BRAKES OR POWER STEERING I ALMOST HIT A PERSON WALKING.

AS I LOST CONFIDENCE IN CHRYSLER BEING ABLE TO PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE VEHICLE, I AM REQUESTING ARBITRATION FOR CHRYSLER TO TAKE THE CAR BACK AND RELIEVE ME OF THE LEASE AS I DON'T WANT TO ENDANGER MY SON'S LIFE, ESPECIALLY THAT IT TOOK HIM A FRIGHTENING 5 TO 6 SECONDS TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE DURING THE LAST INSTANCE.

WHILE DRIVING I FOUND IT INCREASING DIFFICULT TO SEE THE ROAD SURFACE AND ESPECIALLY SEE THE LINES ON THE ROAD.  I HAD MY FAMILY IN THE CAR AND THE SITUATION BECAME QUITE DANGEROUS WITH A SUDDENNESS THAT I WAS UNPREPARED FOR.  ONCE I WAS ABLE TO STOP SAFELY I DISCOVERED THAT THE JEEP HEADLIGHTS WERE FULLY COVERED BY SNOW AND NOT ALLOWING LIGHT TO PASS THROUGH TO THE ROAD SURFACE.  I WIPED THE SNOW AWAY AND GOT BACK ON THE ROAD--WITHIN 10 MINUTES OR SO THE HEADLIGHTS WERE AGAIN COVERED BY SNOW WHICH ACCUMULATED ON THE SURFACE ON THE LENS. THIS CREATED ANOTHER DANGEROUS SITUATION.  APPARENTLY THE LED LIGHTS ARE NOT WARM ENOUGH TO MELT THE ACCUMULATING SNOW AND THE SURROUNDING BEZEL AREA RETAINS SNOW AS WELL. WHILE I AM NOT AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER, I THINK THERE'S A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE GEOMETRY OF THE JEEP HEADLIGHTS AND COOLER LED LIGHTING.  IMPORTANTLY, THIS ACCUMULATION HAPPENED A SECOND TIME AFTER THE CAR WAS FULLY WARMED UP.  I HAVE DRIVEN MANY CARS OVER THE YEARS IN POOR CONDITIONS AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PHENOMENON BEFORE.

THE WHOLE JEEP WOULD SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY FOR LONGER THAN 1-3 MINUTES. I DID NOTICE THAT IF CROSSING OVER BRIDGES IN A STRAIGHT AWAY, THE WOBBLE WAS LESS SEVERE THAN IF I WAS IN A SLIGHT CURVE, OR ANGLE. ALSO, I DID NOTICE THAT IF I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL BEFORE, DURING AND FOR A SHORT PERIOD AFTER BRIDGES, THE JEEP DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLE AS OFTEN. THIS MAY NEED TO BE CHECKED, THE TECHS ARE REPLACING PARTS THEY ARE BEING TOLD TO BY JEEP, BUT JEEP DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE DEATH WOBBLE, MAYBE IT ISN'T DIRECTLY RELAYED TO ONLY THE FRONT STEERING DAMPER.",

WHEN I BEGAN TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT, IT FELT LIKE THE STEERING WAS LOCKED AND IT WAS ONLY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORCE THAT I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE MY LANE CHANGE.

THIS CONDITION CONTINUED UNTIL I ARRIVED HOME SOME FIVE TO TEN MILES AWAY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IT WAS VERY HOT THAT AFTERNOON (APPROXIMATELY 95F). I HAVE READ THAT JEEP IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND THAT THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE CAUSE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE IS THE NEW ALUMINUM STEERING GEAR BOX THEY INTRODUCED ON THIS MODEL. THE FACT THAT ALUMINUM HAS A GREATER THERMAL EXPANSION RATE THAN THE PREVIOUSLY USED STEEL STEERING GEARBOXES CERTAINLY WARRANTS THIS SUSPICION. I HAVE ALSO READ THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS HAD SEVERAL \"CONFIRMED REPAIRS\" OF THIS \"STEERING LOCKUP\" ISSUE BY REPLACING THE STEERING GEARBOX WITH A RUMORED NEW, MODIFIED ONE. WITH THESE CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND, I BELIEVE THE HIGH TEMPERATURES OF THAT DAY CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPANSION OF MY JEEP'S ALUMINUM GEARBOX CAUSING IT TO BIND UP AND LOCK THE STEERING.
