        "summary": "This is a 2021 BMW X5 with BMW's blind spot warning system.  The vehicle currently has approximately 5,500 miles and was purchased new.  The blind spot warning system has consistently malfunctioned since the vehicle was delivered.  When monitoring the right side (passenger side) blind spot it only picks up on average 1 of each 3 vehicles encountered and completely the ignores the the others.  By \"picks up\" I mean the visual indication in the right side mirror is lighted when the vehicle is in the blind spot. For those the system does not detect there is no visual indication of the vehicle and if the right turn signal is activated there IS NO WARNING of the vehicle in the blind spot. This effectively renders this critical safety system completely useless and a serious safety hazard as it is clearly malfunctioning.     Upon complaining, the X5 was inspected by the dealer who reported that no malfunction was found and the system \"is functioning as designed\".  After additional discussion with the service manage the dealer verbally admitted the system was not detecting other cars on the right side of the vehicle consistently but as there was no electrical fault detected in the system, it must be OK and it was not a repairable issue.  Assuming the dealer's analysis of the problem is correct, this leads to the conclusion there is a serious safety design flaw in BMW's blind spot detection system.    A brief examination of various BMW related internet forums shows this issue, or very similar issues concerning the function and design of the BMW blind spot detection system have been reported by several BMW owners, suggesting the problem is likely a design flaw and not a simple component failure.",

The dealer says the lights are fine but relative to the other cars, there is clearly a problem with low beams on undulating roads. On undulating roads or going up hills, the low beams often only illuminate about 20 ft in front of the car. The problem appears to be BMW has drastically limited the upward lighting from the lights for safety of other drivers. However, they have gone too far and created a safety issue with too little upward illumination to be safe on uneven roads. The low beams are great on a perfectly flat surface, but even with a small up hill grade, the low beams are not set to provide enough lighting of the road. I have taken to driving with high beams on for undulating roads because of the lighting provided by the low beams is so bad. This means inadvertently blinding oncoming drivers because I don't turn the high beam headlights down soon enough. I often need to use high beams to read the names of side street signs. The turn signal does a better job illuminating these side street signs than the low beams. By trying to enhance safety for on coming drivers from low beams, they forgot to account for real world driving condition of undulating roads and have created a worse safety issue by forcing more frequent use of high beams that absolutely blind on coming divers.",

There is an option in the menu to NOT allow the vehicle to shut off when the driver's door is opened.  That has no affect on the operation at all. As if there is a software glitch ignoring this menu selection. I've contacted the BMW Genius line 2 times and they advised this should not be happening. The dealer advised, after inspection, this is how the car is designed. On several occasions I've had people in the car, to include my disabled parents and had to run errands... That leaves them in the vehicle without any air. There is a \"pre condition\" feature you can activate Only if there is battery power left on the vehicle. My disabled father was found trying to stand outside in 96 degree weather a couple weeks ago while I was attempting to get his prescriptions after a medical appointment.  The system had shut itself off with him in the car and the inside of the vehicle was well over 115 degrees. The problem occurs all the time. I currently have a loaner X3e and that SUV DOES stay on when in sport mode (using combustion engine). I have 2 separate videos of the X3e where the vehicle does Not turn itself off after I open the drivers door and get out.  I feel the design of my X5e is a huge safety issue putting people's lives at risk!  I'd be happy to speak to someone about this issue if needed and am willing to have the vehicle inspected as well. There are no warning lights or indicators that go off and the vehicle has been inspected by the dealership twice since being purchased on 5/14/21, last inspection was yesterday 7/29/21.  Again, I don't understand why BMW is giving different answers and why another vehicle does not have the same potential life safety issue.",

The following day (6/9/2021), after a day of primarily interstate driving (over 200 miles), while stopping at a red light, I felt the brake pedal fall to the floor faster than I was applying pressure and I came to a sudden stop.  The brakes had seized and the car was towed to Thompson BMW.  The tow driver was able to release the brakes by pulling up the brake pedal.  Thompson BMW could not recreate the brake failure but their diagnostics indicated brake failure.  BMW NA was called as my car was less than 6 months old with 9724 miles.  The service advisor told me that they were instructed to replace the Master Cylinder but could not tell me why brakes failed.  Knowing that this was a significant safety concern, I opened a safety complaint with BMW.  BMW could not tell me the root cause of the brake failure and as a result, I had no confidence that the problem was \u201cfixed\u201d.  Master cylinders rarely fail. They also refused to provide me the diagnostics report. They said I was only entitled to the maintenance invoice.  Linda Vitale was assigned my complaint and in a voicemail, told me I lost power to the DSCI module.  She said the DSCI \u201chas a fail-safe mode and if no power was present the conventional brakes\u201d would work.  They replaced the DSCI module and \u201cit should be fine.\u201d  Based on her email, and then conversation, BMW engineering said I had an electrical issue.  So why did the conventional brakes fail? I am very concerned that BMW has not identified the real problem and I can experience this brake failure again. If this failure had occurred while braking on an interstate highway, I could have been killed or vehicle could have caused fatal accident.  I am extremely concerned about the safety of this vehicle, especially since over 60% of my driving in on highways and interstates.",
