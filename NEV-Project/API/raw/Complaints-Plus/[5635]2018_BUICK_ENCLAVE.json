I OPENED A CASE WITH GM ON 9/12/2019  BUT THEY HAVE NOT RETURNED MY CALLS OR EMAILS SINCE 10/3/19.  THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THIS ISSUE AND WAS DOCUMENTED IN A FORUM POST THAT PARALLELS OUR ISSUE HTTPS://WWW.ENCLAVEFORUM.NET/THREADS/2018-AVENIR-ELECTRONIC-EMERGENCY-BRAKE-FAULT.22631/    1) PARKING BRAKE COMING ON AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AS WIFE TRANSPORTED MY DAUGHTER AND SOME OF HER FRIENDS TO THE MALL.  AT A RED LIGHT, CLOSE TO THE MALL MY DAUGHTER COMMENTED ON A SMELL.  THEY PULLED IN THE PARKING SPOT AT THE MALL, MY WIFE NOTICED THE SMELL AS WELL AND WHEN SHE EXITED THE VEHICLE, THE SMELL WAS OVERWHELMING.    2) 2ND MAJOR INCIDENT WHILE MY WIFE WAS IN A DRIVE THRU AND THE E-BRAKE ENGAGED (AGAIN, WHILE THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE).  SHE HAD TO PLACE THE CAR IN PARK AND IT TOOK 1-2 MIN BEFORE THE CAR WOULD DISENGAGE THE E-BRAKE.  THIS INCIDENT CONVINCED US THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT HUMAN ERROR AND TOOK IT TO DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE.  3) SEPT 2019 - WIFE BECAME STUCK IN PARKING LOT WHEN THE E-BRAKE ENGAGED AS SHE PULLED IN A PARKING SPOT (STILL IN DRIVE).  SHE WAS AWARE THAT THE E-BRAKE HAD TURNED ITSELF ON BUT WHEN SHE HOPPED IN THE CAR TO LEAVE, THE E-BRAKE WAS STILL ENGAGED AND WOULDN'T RELEASE. BACK TO DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY CLEARED A CODE (FIRST TIME A CODE WAS PRESENT) AND RE-FLASHED THE E-BRAKE CONTROL.    4) 12/1/19 INCIDENT WHILE SITTING AT RED LIGHT ON A DOWNWARD INCLINE.  ONCE I RELEASED THE BRAKE TO MOVE, THE CAR DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD SO I LOOKED DOWN AT THE DASH TO SEE THE PARKING BRAKE LIGHT ON FOR A QUICK FLASH THEN IT WENT OFF AND THE CAR STARTED TO MOVE.

LAND ADJUSTMENT WORKS SO VEHICLE IS SEEING LINES BUT IF YOU CROSS THE LINE WITHOUT ANY MANUAL EFFORT THE ALERT DOES NOT WORK  A GM ENGINEER FOR THE HOUSTON AREA DROVE THE CAR AND COULD NOT GET ANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS TO WORK.
