The first incident happened on November 26, 2021 around 7pm were I was able to stop prior to hitting a building. I shut the vehicle off and back on again and the power steering was now working. I was unable to get Lincoln to tow the vehicle because it was \"too far\" from the roadside tow drivers service area. On the same day, I drove it the rest of the way home but upon exciting the highway around 7:30pm, the power steering again went out and I was able to stop the vehicle prior to going into the ditch next to the road. I had it towed to a Lincoln dealer in Wixom, Michigan but over the weekend could not locate the vehicle and at that point I was talking to an Advisor with Lincoln. They told her it would be at least 5 weeks before they could even look at the vehicle so per her recommendation, it was towed to Lafontaine Lincoln in Flushing, Michigan. It was in the shop until Wednesday, December 15th. I was informed they changed out the steering rack and pinion but was given no paperwork because they told me it was all covered under warranty. On December 21, 2021 while driving on Linden Road in Fenton, Michigan, it did the same thing with my wife driving and resulted in a compete loss of power steering and she went into the oncoming lane around a bend before she was able to get the vehicle stopped. Luckily there was no oncoming traffic. I will be having it towed again to the dealership. Luckily for me, these incidents have only resulted in near-miss situations but this is a major issue and will result in serious accidents if it hasn't already.",

HAD WE BEEN IN A WORK-ZONE W/CONCRETE BARRICADES AND NO SHOULDER, WE COULD HAVE BEEN RUN OVER/KILLED BY A MACK TRUCK AND/OR OTHER CAR(S) APPROACHING FROM BEHIND AT HIGH SPEEDS.

WE WERE TOLD NOT TO USE INTERIOR CIRCULATION AND IT WOULD HELP, NOT TO USE AIR THE VEHICLE WHEN ACCELERATING LETS EXHAUST AND CARBON MONOXIDE INTO CAR INTERIOR.   TOOK THE SUV TO DEALER AND HAS BEEN WORKED ON SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO FIX.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY FIELD ENGINEER WAS UNABLE TO FINE AND RECOMMEND A REPAIR.  ASKED FORD TO REPURCHASE VEHICLE BUT THEY REFUSED SAYING ITS NORM FOR THE SUV.   THEY DID NOT GIVE ANY REGULATIONS OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS OTHER THAN THEM JUST MAKING A STATEMENT HOPING WE GO AWAY, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BREATHE GAS FUMES WHEN TRAVELING DOWN A HIGHWAY.  WE WERE TOLD NOT TO USE INTERIOR CIRCULATION AND IT WOULD HELP, NOT TO USE AIR CONDITIONER ON MAX.  THE CABIN ON CAR FILLS WITH THE GAS FUMES AND MAKES US TIRED AND FATIGUE WHEN DRIVING FOR EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  WE PURCHASE A LUXURY SUV AS FORD WOULD HAVE YOU TO BELIEVE BUT IT ACTUALLY MORE LIKE A GAS CHAMBER HAVING TO BREATH THIS SEEMS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.  I HOPE THE NHTSA CAN GET FORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND MAKE THEM TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND GET RID OF WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM.",
