I have researched the internet and numerous consumers have complained and needed racking pinning replaced prior to warranty expiration and thereafter. This is definitely a safety concern.

Within the past week I-\ufffd\ufffdve started feeling and hearing a clicking and jerking in the steering wheel when I turn/correct instead of a smooth transition. This starts 20 to 30 minutes after I first start driving, and it-\ufffd\ufffds worse at highway speeds (>50 mph) and gets worse the longer I drive the car. I brought the car to the dealership today and was told that the power steering rack is failing and needs to be replaced. No warning lights or messages appeared at any time. Thankfully I caught the problem early, but it made it difficult to steer the car and keep it straight on the highway, and had the problem progressed, my and others' safety could have been in grave danger. It is unacceptable for the power steering to fail and require major, costly repair in a vehicle that is only 3 years old. #3So.. i have this Honda Civic 2018.. just under 25K Mileage.. for past few weeks the steering is getting stiff and not responding .. it gives a sound of TAK TAK TAK..like jerks when the steering is turned fully either side .. no matter in reverse or in Drive Mode.. i went to Honda Centre and told them and they immediately started making video of steering and taking pics of engine no and chasis.. and didnt even ask me a single question.. and said that your car is in warranty..",

I drove the car to the edge of sidewalk to stop it. Nobody got hurt but the front of the car was damaged. I took it to Honda to investigate the brake failure. First the dealer said they checked and there was nothing wrong we can take to car. Later Honda America told the dealer, the car is not safe and we can\u2019t get it back until they send an expert to check. After the expert, service people at the dealership said the car was OK. The problem could be an unsecured floor mat that interfered with the brakes and that is why brakes failed. We asked why the emergence brakes didn\u2019t work. They said \u201cwhen you pushed the brake the computer has a message that brakes are pushed and emergency brakes don\u2019t come on functioning\u201d.  We removed the moveable floor mat and asked for the expert report. They told me he didn\u2019t write a report.  Later when I confronted Honda America they said there was a written report but I did not have the right to see it. Honda America also refused any responsibility saying it was up to the insurance company and they were closing the report.I believe Honda America is not acting responsibly. HONDA should share the expert report after the first accident,  should investigate what went wrong during the accident, should try to figure out why the brakes failed twice in the same way in a two months period   but operated fine in between.",

Within the past week I\u2019ve started feeling and hearing a clicking and jerking in the steering wheel when I turn/correct instead of a smooth transition. This starts 20 to 30 minutes after I first start driving, and it\u2019s worse at highway speeds (>50 mph) and gets worse the longer I drive the car. I brought the car to the dealership today and was told that the power steering rack is failing and needs to be replaced. No warning lights or messages appeared at any time. Thankfully I caught the problem early, but it made it difficult to steer the car and keep it straight on the highway, and had the problem progressed, my and others' safety could have been in grave danger. It is unacceptable for the power steering to fail and require major, costly repair in a vehicle that is only 3 years old.",

THE RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP (GARBER HONDA IN ROCHESTER) AND THE AUTO MANUFACTURER (AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE COMPANY) IS THAT THIS IS DUE TO 'OUTSIDE INFLUENCES' AND IS THEREFORE NOT COVERED BY THEM.

        "summary": "THE ISSUE IS WITH THE \"ROAD DEPARTURE MITIGATION\" (RDM)SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM MAY HAVE BEEN WORKING AS DESIGNED: BUT IF SO IT CREATED A CORRECTION THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  THE ISSUE OCCURRED  AT A POINT WHERE THE ROAD ABRUPTLY CHANGES FROM A SINGLE LANE TO A THREE-LANE ROAD.  THE THREE-LANE ROAD HAS A SOLID DIVIDER BETWEEN THE THREE WEST-BOUND LANES AND THE THREE-EAST BOUND LANES. THE NORMAL PROCEDURE IS TO ENTER THE THREE-LANE GOING STRAIGHT AHEAD AND THEN MOVE TO THE RIGHT AS DESIRED TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE OR RIGHT-HAND LANE. IN OTHER WORDS THE SINGLE-LANE ROAD MERGERS INTO THE LEFT-HAND LANE  IF YOU KEEP THE STEERING STRAIGHT AHEAD. AS I APPROACHED THE TRANSITION POINT THE RDM  SUDDENLY PULLED THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT (CREATING ABOUT A 30 DEGREE CHANGE IN DIRECTION) AND APPLIED HEAVY  BRAKING.  IF THAT ACTION HAD OCCURRED ON A TWO LANE ROAD WITH A CAR ON MY RIGHT IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A COLLISION. SINCE THERE WAS AN ABRUPT CHANGE IN LANE MARKINGS AND THE SOLID CENTER DIVIDER CLOSE AHEAD; I SUSPECT THE RDM INTERPRETED THAT SITUATION AS \"I WAS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO SOMETHING\".  THE OWNER'S GUIDE SAYS IT WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT IT DID.  BUT IN THIS CASE IT COULD HAVE REPLACED ONE TYPE OF CRASH WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF CRASH;  OR MORE IMPOTENTLY CREATED A CRASH THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL !!",
