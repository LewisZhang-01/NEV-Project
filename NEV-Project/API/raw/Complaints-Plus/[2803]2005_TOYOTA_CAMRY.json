I pick up my vehicle Wednesday night at Hoboken NJ garage , heading home my 2005 Toyota Camry vehicle air bag (steering wheel) deployed. As I was driving (15mph) no lights was on the dashboard,  no pot holes on the street and there was no accident involving my vehicle.  I was hit in the face from the air bag pretty hard it almost made me crash into a electric pole and gas station. 911 was called, the Jersey City police department, fire department and  Ambulance arrived. The area was block off looking for car parts or pot holes nothing was found so the police report can be completed. I treated inside the ambulance at the scene,  my left hand was burned and head/ neck was hurting. I just decline going to the hospital at the moment. The police called a towing company as I called my car insurance to informing them the situation. As my vehicle was being towed away the police officer said its a malfunction problem it can be a recall I don't know about. The following day I was in touch with my claim agent from my insurance,  letting them no where my vehicle was towed at. They informed me to get in touch with the Toyota to see if they going to take full responsibility of the air bag being deployed on July 14, 2021 . I called Toyota Corporation and gave them all the information they asked and then I was told a inspector would reach out to inspect my 2005 Toyota Camry vehicle but it has to be a auto body shop. The place the police got my vehicle towed to  the  night ofJuly 14, 2021 from Hoboken NJ was not a auto body shop. It was just inside a gate full of other cars. I paid full price for storage fees end up getting my 2005 Camry to a auto body shop in Jersey City NJ were the Toyota Corporation inspector came out July 27 2021 . I called Toyota Corporation multiple times they kept saying it takes up to 30days to make decision from the inspection notes. Yesterday August 25 2001 I received a email they not taking blame.",

IN ADDITION, MANY MECHANICS I HAVE TALKED TO STATED THAT THE OVERDRIVE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE USED THAT OFTEN  AND IT IS STRANGE THAT THE TOYOTA CAMRYS WERE BUILT TO HAVE THE OVERDRIVE ON CONTINUOUSLY.  I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO RECALL,BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS OFTEN, BUT MAY NOT BE REPORTED DUE TO THE MILEAGE.",

        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2005 TOYOTA CAMRY LE IN AUGUST, 2005. AFTER ABOUT 3 YEARS, I STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH BOTH FRONT SEATBELTS RETRACTING PROPERLY. WHEN THE SEATBELT IS INITIALLY PULLED OUT TO PUT IT ON, IT DOES NOT RETRACT TO CREATE A SNUG FIT WHILE WEARING IT. THE FABRIC PART OF THE SEATBELT FOLDS OVER AND TWISTS, PREVENTING IT FROM RETRACTING. MOST OF THE TIME IT CAN BE CORRECTED WITH A LITTLE MANIPULATION AND MUCH FRUSTRATION. BUT, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW INCIDENTS WHERE I HAVE HAD TO TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC TO FIX IT. I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON COMPLAINT FOR MY SPECIFIC YEAR, MAKE, & MODEL AND THEY SAID IT WOULD COST BETWEEN $300-$400 PER SEATBELT TO REPLACE THE PARTS OR I COULD JUST WAIT FOR TOYOTA TO ISSUE A RECALL. THAT WAS 4 YEARS AGO AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL FOR THE PROBLEM. I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT  THERE SEEMS TO BE AN OBVIOUS DEFECT IN THE SEATBELTS ON THIS CAR, BASED ON THE # OF COMPLAINTS I'VE READ ON NUMEROUS WEBSITES REGARDING THIS EXACT ISSUE. I JUST HOPE TOYOTA IS NOT WAITING FOR A SERIOUS INJURY OR A FATALITY TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY ISSUE A RECALL. I WOULD LIKE TO GET A NEWER CAR BUT I WOULD NEED TO SELL THIS ONE FIRST IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. HOWEVER, I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SELLING MY CAR TO ANYONE WITH SUCH A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE PRESENT. I DON'T NEED OR WANT THAT KIND OF KARMA.  *TR",

I PREFER TO USE THE \"SET\" FEATURE TO ENGAGE CRUISE CONTROL EACH TIME RATHER THAN THE \"RESUME\" CHOICE BECAUSE THE \"SET\" FEATURE PROVIDES SMOOTHER RIDES THAN THE \"RESUME\" FEATURE. ..I BARELY MISSED STRIKING THE CAR IN FRONT OF MINE AS I DOWNSHIFTED TO SLOW THE 2005 CAMRY.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FROM WHICH I BOUGHT THE CAR & SPOKE TO A MANAGER OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  HE TOLD ME MY EXPERIENCE COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP & EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO A DIFFERENT PERSON.  THE MANAGER OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT APPEARED AND INSISTED I AGREE TO PAY $100 FOR TOYOTA TO LOOK AT THE CAR BECAUSE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE SAME REPRESENTATIVE THEN SUGGESTED I WAS TRYING TO GET FREE SERVICE FROM TOYOTA.  I REFUSED TO PAY FOR AN INSPECTION, ASKED TO SPEAK TO HIS SUPERVISOR & ONLY THEN DID THE REP RELENT TO INSPECT THE CAR WITHOUT PAYMENT.  THE LOCAL REPS REPORTED THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM & CONCLUDED THE SYSTEMS WERE OPERATING AS DESIGNED.  THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR 2 MORE DAYS SO AN INSPECTOR TRAVELING FROM DC COULD EXAMINE THE CAR.  THE EXPERT REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS LOCAL FOLKS.  I DO NOT KNOW IF TOYOTA HAS REPORTED THIS INCIDENT.  *TR  UPDATED 01/31/12 *BF  UPDATED VIN. UPDATED IVOQ 02/24/12",

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLESOME WHEN MAKING TURNS AND MAKES ME VULNERABLE TO BEING REAR ENDED IN RIGHT HAND TURNS, BUT EXPOSES ME TO BEING BROADSIDED IN LEFT HAND TURNS.

WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED I GOT THIS GRATING NOISE AND THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL I WAS HALF THROUGH THE STOP SIGN. LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CARS COMING AND THERE WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. THIS TIME I WROTE A LETTER TO TOYOTA MOTOR SALES USA IN TORRANCE, CA ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THE CASE NUMBER WAS [XXX]  AND THEY HAD ME GO TO EHRLICH MOTORS IN GREELEY, CO ON 1/16/2007 TO HAVE THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM CHECKED OUT. THEIR RESPONSE WAS 'VEHICLE OPERATING AS DESIGNED'.

BECAUSE IT IS SO SPORADIC, LIKE IT WILL DO IT FOR 2-3 DAYS AND THEN NOT FOR 2-3 DAYS, TO HAVE SOMEONE CHECK IT THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN THE SHOP AND I NEED A CAR TO GO TO WORK.  TO HAVE IT CHECKED INVOLVES A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT MUST BE ELECTRICAL...HOW DO I KNOW???? *TR",

AS A RESULT THE DRIVER'S UPPER BODY WILL BE TWISTED, THE LEFT SIDE FORWARD WHILE THE RIGHT SIDE LEANING BACKWARDS.   I FIRST ASSUMED THIS IS A TEMPORARY CONDITION. LIKE WITH EVERYTHING NEW IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME UNTIL THINGS GET ADJUSTED AND AFTER SOME USE I FIGURED, THE SEAT MAY SOMEHOW LOOSEN UP A LITTLE.

THERE WAS FLUID DRIPPING BEHIND THE RT FRONT WHEEL WITH THE TEXTURE OF \"OIL\" BUT FUEL DRIPPING FROM BEHIND THE FR TIRE, WHICH WAS \"CURED\" BY PUTTING IN A NEW INJECTOR.    AUGUST 24, 2006 (7000 MILEAGE) I COMPLAINED THAT VEHICLE WAS \"LEAKING  OIL\" AND AGAIN SMELLING OF RAW GAS.  DIAGNOSIS & REPAIR:  DEALERSHIP \"VERIFIED RR STRUT IS LEAKING, THROUGH THE SEAL, REPLACED RR STRUT.\"  NOTE:  BOTH TIMES I WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO DRIVE MY CAR INTO THEIR SERVICE AREA, BUT TO LEAVE MY CAR OUTSIDE.

I KNEW THE CAR SPED UP WHEN I ACCELERATED TO MERGE AND AS I TRIED TO STOP THE CAR BY PUSHING ON THE BRAKES, IT WOULD NOT SLOW DOWN AND IMMEDIATELY SEEMED TO GO OFF THE ROAD IN THE LT LANE FISHTAILING WHILE I BRAKED. FORTUNATELY I DID LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND DID NOT HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE DURING THE ACCIDENT. I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT BEFORE THIS AND HAVE DRIVEN FOR APPROX. 32 YEARS WHEN THIS HAPPENED. I KNOW THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP WHICH I TOLD THE CHP AND MY INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR WHO SENT FORENSICS TO THE AUTO YARD. WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE NEW TIRES WERE AT FAULT BUT WITH TOYOTAS RECENT TRANSPARENCY, IT BECOMES OBVIOUS THEY KNEW OF THIS ISSUE BUT FAILED TO PUT OUT A RECALL FOR ACCELERATION PROBLEMS RECENTLY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY KNOWING OF AN ISSUE AND IT'S POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO DEATH FOR SOME OF ITS CUSTOMERS BUT LACKED THE SAFETY CONSCIOUS TO RECALL THEIR ACCELERATORS AND BRAKING SYSTEMS. *TR",

THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT PURSUE TOYOTA FOR REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE THE COST TO DO SO WOULD EXCEED THE COST TO REPAIR THE CAR (ABOUT $5,000).  THE DEALERS REPAIR SHOP SAYS THAT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS LOW, BURNED AND BLACK AND THIS CAUSED THE CAR TO LURCH FORWARD. IN THE COURSE OF REPAIRS THEY FLUSHED AND REFILLED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID (AT OUR EXPENSE) AND SAID THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED WITH ONLY 12,630 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AND THE FRONT END REPAIRED AFTER A SIMILAR CRASH. WE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ANY PROBLEM REGARDING THE ACCELERATOR SYSTEM STICKING AT THAT TIME.   WITH THE MOST RECENT TOYOTA RECALL I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT REFLASHING THE COMPUTER FOR THAT PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE THAT CONTROLS THE ACCELERATOR SYSTEM.

I CONTACTED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE OUT TO INVESTIGATE MY CLAIM. THEY KEPT MY VEHICLE FOR OVER THREE WEEKS, THEN THEY STARTED ON THE BODY REPAIR. TOYOTA CLAIMED THEY COULD NOT SUBSTANTIATE MY CLAIM OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION, BUT I KNOW THEY REPAIRED MY VEHICLE INTERNALLY AS WELL AS THE BODY WORK BECAUSE WHEN I PICKED MY CAR UP FROM JOSEPH TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THE CAR ACCELERATION PEDAL FELT SO DIFFERENT. IT FELT REAL STIFF AND HARD TO MASH. THE BRAKES WERE CHECK AND FIXED, BECAUSE DURING THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION THEY FAIL TO STOP THE CAR.

MY CAMRY WOULD TAKE OFF AT HIGH SPEEDS FROM A COMPLETE STOP AND APPLYING THE GAS PEDAL.  THIS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES. I TOOK MY CAR TO MY DEALER BILL PAGE TOYOTA IN FALLS CHURCH, VA.      THE FIRST TIME THE ACCELERATION OCCURRED WAS AFTER 2 YEARS AND IN MARCH 2007.  I WAS ON CONSTITUTION AVENUE, RIGHT LANE IN DC--WHICH EITHER TURNS RIGHT OR GOES STRAIGHT.  CONSTITUTION AVENUE IS 3 OR 4 LANES EACH EAST AND WESTBOUND--I WAS HEADING EASTBOUND.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME TURNED RIGHT, THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE AS I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND UNTO THE GAS, MY CAR SHOT FORWARD SO FAST MY BRAKES WOULDN'T STOP MY CAR.  UPON SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES WHICH WERE SHUDDERING SO BADLY, I THOUGHT MY CAR WAS NEVER GOING TO STOP AND HIT THE NEXT CAR (RUSH HOUR).  I STOPPED SHORT OF HITTING THAT CAR.  I WAS SO SCARED.  MY SERVICE MANAGER SAID COULDN'T REPRODUCE AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BRAKES OR CAR.  HE TOLD ME THAT THE SHUTTERING IS NORMAL WHEN I SLAM ON MY BRAKES--A SAFETY FEATURE TO STOP THE CAR. COMPUTER SAID NOTHING WRONG.         HAD THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM AT LEAST 3 MORE TIMES. I WAS AT A PARKING METER, 1ST SPACE.  GOT INTO MY CAR, TURNED ON THE KEY, RELEASED MY EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND UNTO THE GAS.  I WANTED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN.  THERE WERE 2 PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK, AND THANKFULLY THEY DID NOT WALK IN FRONT OF MY CAR--I WOULD HAVE RUN OVER THEM.  MY CAR TOOK OFF SO FAST FROM A STOPPED POSITION THAT I HAD A HARD TIME STOPPING MY CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY 2005 CAMRY TO THE DEALER. AGAIN SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME COMPUTER SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR--THINK COMPUTER/SOFTWARE GLITCH.     LAST WEEK TOYOTA CORP SAID WON'T FIX B/C NOT ON RECALL AND ONLY INTERMITTENT, WHICH IS THE PROBLEM.  TOLD ME I OWN THE CAR, IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY WON'T PAY TO FIX.  HELP!

MY 2005 CAMRY LE BEGAN EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM BACK IN EARLY 2008 AND IT IS PROGRESSIVELY GETTING WORSE. I TOOK MY CAR INTO MY MECHANIC AT HARBOR AUTO CENTER IN COSTA MESA, CA ABOUT A YEAR 1/2 AGO TO GET THE PROBLEM CHECKED. (I DON'T TRUST TOYOTA DEALERSHIP REPAIR SERVICE OR THEIR PRICES). UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION HE WAS ABLE TO DISCOVER WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND EVEN FOUND A TOYOTA TECHNICAL SEVICE BULLETIN TITLED \"STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT NOISE\", REFERENCE # ST001-06, DATE OF ISSUE 2/16/06 THAT OUTLINED THE EXACT PROBLEM WITH MY STEERING COLUMN. I THEN CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, BUT SINCE MY CAR WAS PAST THE 72,000 MILE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THIS WAS NOT A RECALL ITEM, THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHARGE ME. OBVIOUSLY TOYOTA CORPORATION IS VERY AWARE THAT THERE IS A MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING SHAFT ON THESE TWO MAKES & MODELS, SINCE EVEN THE DEALERSHIP WAS AWARE OF THE SERVICE BULLETON. EVEN THOUGH MY MECHANIC THOUGHT MY CAR WAS PROBABLY OK TO DRIVE, I AM VERY CONCERNED, BECAUSE THE CLUNKING NOISE IS GETTING MORE PRONOUCED THE LONGER I DRIVE THE CAR, ESPECIALLY WHEN I TURN THE WHEEL, GO OVER SPEED BUMPS OR BRAKE AND TURN. I'M NOT SURE WHAT RECOURSE I HAVE TO GET THIS FIXED, BUT WITH ALL THE CURRENT PROBLEMS TOYOTA IS EXPERIENCING, IT MAKES ME VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEPENDABILITY OF MY OWN CAR.

MY TOYOTA DEALER SAYS, TOO, THAT THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT POSSIBLE AND REFUSES TO MODIFY THE BRAKE PEDAL TO RAISE IT ABOVE THE ACCELERATOR LEVEL.

AS SOON AS I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO GET READY TO PULL INTO MY DRIVEWAY(VERY CAUTIOUSLY) THEY JUST DIDN'T WORK AND I SLID SLOWLY DOWN THE REST OF THE STREET (APPR. 200 FT) INTO THE CROSS ROAD, WHICH THANKFULLY HAD NO CARS APPROACHING, AND I ROLLED RIGHT INTO A TREE.

THIS IS THE THIRD CAMRY THAT WE HAVE OWNED, AND UNTIL NOW, WE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASED WITH ALL OF THEM FROM THE STYLE, THE PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE.  ON DECEMBER 23, 2009, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PARK, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD, ACCELERATED, HIT A PARKED VEHICLE, AND UPON MY (LILLIE) TRYING TO APPLY THE BRAKES, THE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR, AND THUS THE BRAKES DID NOT CATCH.  I MANAGED TO MANEUVER THE CAR TO AN EMPTY LOT AND BRING IT TO A STOP.  THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CAR WITH ME INCLUDING A CHILD.  I WAS DISTRAUGHT.  OF COURSE, DAMAGE WAS DONE TO BOTH VEHICLES.  WHEN MY HUSBAND ARRIVED, HE TRIED THE BRAKES, AND THEY DID NOT CATCH.  AFTER REPORTING THIS INCIDENT TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY, WE CALLED THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER TO TOW IT IN TO BE CHECKED.  THE BRAKES WERE TESTED, AND ACCORDING TO THE MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM FOUND AT THIS TIME.    UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST ACCIDENT WITH THE BRAKES FAILING.  SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR IN AUGUST OF 2005, AND AGAIN ATTEMPTING TO PARK, THE VEHICLE LURCHED FORWARD AND WENT THROUGH THE WALL OF A LOCAL RESTAURANT.  FORTUNATELY, THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED, AND NO ONE WAS INJURED, HOWEVER, EXTENSIVE DAMAGE WAS DONE TO BOTH THE CAR AND THE RESTAURANT.  I WAS SURE THE BRAKES FAILED, BUT THINKING THIS WAS PROBABLY UNUSUAL, I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT PERHAPS SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW, I WAS NOT QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BRAKES.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL THIS HAPPENED AGAIN, THAT I KNEW THE BRAKES HAD CERTAINLY FAILED.  THESE WERE TWO FRIGHTENING, EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCES.   THE FIRST ONE WAS REPORTED TO THE POLICE.  BOTH WERE REPORTED TO OUR INSURANCE. *TR  JAMES & LILLIE WILSON",

IT IS WHEN THE BELT IS PULLED OUT JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN 15 INCHES (SAY, FOR A LARGE PERSON GETTING INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT) IS WHEN IT JAMS UP.  VERY DANGEROUS, AS IT MAKE THE DRIVER'S SEAT BELT PRACTICALLY UNUSABLE. SO FAR, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS TO BE TAKE BACK TO THE DEALER, THIS HAPPENED TWICE. *TR",

I BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO THINGS IS EXACTLY WHAT CAUSES THIS PROBLEM. TWICE I HAVE TALKED TO SOMEONE AT THE DEALER. ONCE THEY TOLD ME SOME VEHICLES VIN #'S ARE QUALIFIED FOR A COMPUTER SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS VIN#'S ARE NOT. TODAY I CALLED AND THE SERVICE GUY AND HE  TOLD ME THERE IS NO SUCH RECALL AT ALL AND HE HASN'T HAD ANYONE COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS ISSUE. ALSO, MY MOM HAS A 2006 V6 CAMRY AND HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH HER CAR. I HAVE DRIVEN IT. EXACT SAME THING. SO FAR THAT IS 2 FOR 2. AAMCO LOOKED AT MY TRANS FLUID TODAY AND SAID IT LOOKED UNUSUALLY DIRTY AND IS BEGINNING TO BURN WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE COMPLETE FAILURE. AAMCO CAN DO WARRANTY WORK. THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO FIND A REAL PROBLEM WITH YOUR TRANSMISSION. THE DEALER DOES NOT WANT FIX  YOU TRANS UNDER WARRANTY! *TR",

LUCKILY I MADE IT INTO A PARKING LOT WHERE A MECHANIC WAS  ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CARS COMPUTER.  THE DIAGNOSTIC SAID IT WAS OUR THROTTLE BODY, AND THAT WE COULD MAKE IT HOME IF WE TOOK IT EASY.  DURING THE 5 MILE TRIP THE CAR WOULD SURGE BETWEEN 1,500 AND 3,000 RPMS AND WOULD DIE AT STOP LIGHTS IN THE DRIVE POSITION.  I LEARNED TO PLACE THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND LET IT RACE UNTIL THE LIGHT TURNED AND THEN PLACE IN DRIVE. THE REST OF THE WAY HOME I KEPT THE CAR IN HIGH RPMS >3,500 TO KEEP FROM FEELING THE SURGE.  AT HOME I RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT I AM NOT THE FIRST, AND LUCKY THAT IT DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  OTHER SITES MENTIONED TO GET THROTTLE BODY CLEANER AND A SOFT RAG TO WIPE GRIME FROM THROTTLE BODY.  AFTER DOING SO THE CAR WOULD IDLE AT 200 RPM.

THEY SAY PROBLEM COULD BE IN COMPUTER BOX TO TRANSMISSION (THAT CANNOT BE ACCESSED BY TECHNICIANS) IS SET AT FACTORY AND CANNOT BE ADJUSTED.  ALL THIS COMPUTERIZED HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS THAT A CUSTOMER COMPLAINS ABOUT.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE THUMPING NOISE ON DRIVER AND PASSENGER WINDOWS MAKE WHEN GOING DOWN.
