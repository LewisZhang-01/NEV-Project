I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THEY, THE MANUFACTURER, DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT AND KILLED. THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT OLDER VEHICLES LOCATED IN THE HIGHER HUMIDITY ZONES TAKE PRIORITY. I HAVE EXPLAINED THAT MY CAR IS A 2010 AND IS LOCATED IN ZONE B. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT THE HIGHEST HUMIDITY ZONE BUT IT IS THE SECOND MOST AND IT IS MUCH OLDER THAN MOST CARS THAT ARE RECEIVING REPLACEMENT AIR BAGS. I KNOW 4 PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD THE AIR BAGS IN THEIR VEHICLES REPLACED AND THEY ARE IN THE SAME ZONE AND ARE MUCH NEWER THAN MY VEHICLE. EVEN THOUGH THIS VEHICLE IS IN MY NAME, I PURCHASED IT FOR MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND EVERYDAY SHE IS IN THIS CAR, I HAVE MAJOR ANXIETY ISSUES. THE REASON THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU IS TO DETERMINE WHY THE MANUFACTURER HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO REPLACE THIS FAULTY AIR BAG. I FIND THIS RESPONSE UNACCEPTABLE. I ALSO HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT NEWER VEHICLES IN THE SAME AREA HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR AIR BAGS REPLACED AND I AM STILL WAITING. I CONTACTED A ONE OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES TODAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY ADVISED ME TO SUBMIT A COMPLAINT. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY HELP THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE IN ORDER TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE SO THAT I CAN BE ASSURED THAT MY DAUGHTER IS SAFE WHEN SHE IS DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.

I CALLED 911 AND WAITED IN A VERY DANGEROUS POSITION ON THE RAMP, WITH CARS SPEEDING AROUND THE CURVE, AND MY VEHICLE HALF IN THE LANE.  WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO START UP THE CAR AND IT DROVE SEEMINGLY NORMALLY.  I BROUGHT IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC, WHO COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM MYSELF ONLINE, AND IT BECAME IMMEDIATELY APPARENT THAT THIS WAS A DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP, AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL AND NUMEROUS BULLETINS REGARDING THE NECESSITY OF REPLACING THE FAULTY PARTS TO ENSURE SAFETY.
