THE MANUFACTURER REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ISSUE AND IS BLAMING IT ON HITTING THE CURB WHICH IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. OTHER PEOPLE ON-LINE COMPLAIN OF SIMILAR FRAME FAILURE.  THE RV INDUSTRY IS NOT PROPERLY REGULATED AND A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THIS FRAME COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE DEATH AND INJURY.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THAT THING AND I JUST PURCHASED IT.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE IT. *BF  *TR",
