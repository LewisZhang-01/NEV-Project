ALTHOUGH MANY CARS WERE SCRAMBLING TO STOP, MINE WAS THE ONLY ACCIDENT.  I AM AN EXPERIENCED DRIVER AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A GOOD AND SAFE DRIVER.  I DID NOT RELEASE THE BRAKES--I KNOW HOW ANTI-LOCKS WORK AND I KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.  MY OTHER CAR HAS ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, SO I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES THAT WORK WELL.  I RAISED HELL AT THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD THE SERVICE MANAGER AND THEIR HEAD BRAKE GURU TEST THE BRAKES.  THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE FINE AND WORKING PROPERLY.  THEY ARE WRONG.

THE STOPPING POWER IS ACTUALLY VERY DIMINISHED WITH THE ABS ACTIVATED THAN WHEN IT IS NOT ACTIVATED. ONCE THE ABS COMES INTO PLAY, THE VEHICLE FEELS LIKE IT SPEEDS UP. I REALIZE THAT THE ABS IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE WHEELS FROM LOCKING UP AND THAT ONE SHOULD HOLD A CONSTANT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL RATHER THAN PUMPING THE BRAKES. HOWEVER, IN DRY CONDITIONS, I CAN STOP THE VEHICLE QUICKER AND IN A SHORTER DISTANCE IF I DO NOT ALLOW THE TO ABS ACTIVATE. OF COURSE ONE DOES NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE IN A PANIC STOP SITUATION. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERED INTO THE VEHICLE. I RECENTLY READ THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON THE 2000 SUBURBAN AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT GM DID NOT PROVIDE THE SAME 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKE SYSTEM INTRODUCED IN THE '99 PICK UP MODELS. THE ACCIDENT I RECENTLY EXPERIENCED COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THE BRAKING SYSTEM OPERATED AS IT SHOULD HAVE.",

THE ABS SHOULD NOT HAVE KICKED IN SINCE THIS WAS NOT A PANIC STOP OR A WHEEL LOCK UP SITUATION.  I KEPT THE BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSED AND WITHIN ONE OR TWO SECONDS THE ABS TURNED OFF AND NORMAL BRAKING RESUMED..  I KNOW WHAT NORMAL ABS FUNCTIONING FEELS LIKE SINCE I HAVE TESTED THEM UNDER A CONTROLLED PANIC STOP SITUATION.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS FAILURE HAS HAPPENED TO ME UNDER A NORMAL BRAKING SITUATION.  I DISMISSED THE FIRST EVENT AS A FREAK OCCURRENCE UNTIL MY WIFE REAR ENDED A TRUCK IN FRONT OF HER ON 21 SEPTEMBER, WHILE IN SLOW MOVING TRAFFIC.

DEALER COMMITTED TO CONTACT FACTORY REP. AND HAS STATED FACTORY REP. WILL CONTACT US THIS WEEK TO DRIVE VEHICLE FOR EXTENDED PERIOD.  CURRENTLY WAITING TO HEAR FROM FACTORY REP., BUT DEALER DOES NOT EXPECT HIM TO FIND ANY PROBLEM.  IT IS OUR OPINION THAT VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO OPERATE DUE TO THE RANDOMNESS OF APPLYING BRAKES AND HAVING VEHICLE GO INTO \"COAST\" MODE.  DUE TO NUMBER OF TIMES THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO DEALER FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THE FACT THAT IT FINALLY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT WITH INJURIES, WE FEEL THAT GMC SHOULD TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY.  FIRST, NECESSARY REPAIRS SHOULD BE MADE TO MAKE THE VEHICLE SAFE.  SECOND, GMC HAS A FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPENSATE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE MALFUNCTION OF THE FACTORY EQUIPMENT.  RESEARCH INTO THIS SITUATION HAS FOUND INFORMATION INDICATING GMC IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.",

THE TECHNICIAN I SPOKE WITH INFORMED ME THAT S-10 MODELS, VARIOUS PICKUPS AS WELL AS SUBURBANS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH WIPERS ACTING ERRATIC. THE CURRENT RECALL IS LIMITED TO POST 1994 MODELS, AND I PERSONALLY KNOW OF ANOTHER VEHICLE (1993 PICKUP) THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.
