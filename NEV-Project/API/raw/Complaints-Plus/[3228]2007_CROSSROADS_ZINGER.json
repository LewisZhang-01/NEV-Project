THE TRAVEL TRAILER WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS AND I SUBSEQUENTLY PURCHASED A NEW 2008 ZINGER 26 RL TRAVEL TRAILER WHICH EXHIBITS THE SAME INSTABILITY AS THE 2007 MODEL. I CONTACTED THE CROSSROADS RV COMPANY LOCATED IN INDIANA AND INFORMED THEM OF THE INSTABILITY PROBLEM. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM AND SAID THEY WOULD MOVE THE TRAVEL TRAILER AXLES BACK ON THE TRAILER WHICH SHOULD ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM AT NO CHARGE TO ME. I LATER LEARNED THAT MOVING THE AXLES WOULD INCREASE THE TRAILER TONGUE WEIGHT. THIS INCREASE WOULD EXCEED BY 200 LBS THE SAFETY LIMITATIONS OF THE HITCH ON MY FORD EXPEDITION. WHEN I INFORMED CROSSROADS RV THAT I DECLINED HAVING THEM MOVE THE AXLES BECAUSE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE, THEY REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME A REFUND FOR THE TRAILER. THEY SUBSEQUENTLY SENT ME A LETTER IMPLYING THAT I AND NOT THEY ARE AT FAULT FOR THE INSTABILITY PROBLEM. *TR",
