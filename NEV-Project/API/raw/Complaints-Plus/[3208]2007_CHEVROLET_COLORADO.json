NOTE- I DO NOT HAVE AN AFTERMARKET ALARM OR LOCKS ON MY TRUCK, I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY AFTERMARKET ANYTHING ON MY TRUCK BESIDES TINTED WINDOWS.      I CHECKED THE BATTERY WITH MY MULTIMETER, VOLTAGE WAS AT 12.7VDC.  AFTER A FEW MORE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS, I UNHOOKED THE BATTERY AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES TO MAYBE RESET THE COMPUTER.  TRIED AGAIN AND FOUND THAT THE COMPUTER DID NOT RESET.  CALLED THE DEALER, JN AUTOMOTIVE IN HONOLULU, AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM AND TO BRING IT IN. I GOT IT TOWED THERE AND AFTER A DAY THEY SAID THAT THE BATTERY HAD A LOW VOLTAGE OF 11.6~VDC AND THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T START/TURN OVER.  I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT 11+VDC WILL TURN AN ENGINE OVER AT LEAST A FEW TIMES IF NOT JUST START IT. SO THEY WERE ABLE TO START THE TRUCK BY APPARENTLY UNHOOKING THE BATTERY FROM THE TRUCK FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME (MAYBE AN HOUR, OVERNIGHT, WHATEVER) AND REPLACING IT.  THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE OF WHY MY TRUCK \"ALL OF A SUDDEN\" INITIATED THE ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM AND LOCK ME OUT FROM STARTING THE ENGINE.    THEY CHARGED ME OVER $200 FOR A NEW BATTERY PLUS $100+ FOR LABOR BECAUSE THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE BATTERY AND NOT THE TRUCK ELECTRONICS.  I REALLY NEEDED MY TRUCK AS I HAD ALL MY TOOLS AND PAPERWORK IN THERE AND I HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK.  THEY SAID THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM.  GOOGLE REVEALED MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS PROBLEM. OH, AND BY THE WAY, WHEN I WAS THERE I SAW AT LEAST 6 NEWER CORVETTES AND 4 NEWER AVALANCHES THERE FOR SOME PROBLEM SO WATCH OUT CHEVY OWNERS...     *TR",
