Ford has known about this issue under Field service actions 17N03 and 19N05. If Ford has known of the issue why will they not make the issue an active recall? This is a health and safety concern, and could potentially be fatal. I have called Ford and filed an official complaint, there is nothing they will do since there are no active recalls on my vehicle, so we have to foot the bill??  They asked if I had a warranty, which I do, but if I didn't? This is would be a large expense.   When I called [XXX] in McKinney, TX they didn't seem to care or know anything about the exhaust leak, they had a 10 day wait for diagnostics, with no rental vehicles.

Luckily my husband was just backing it out of our garage  He heard a loud noise sounding like he had run over something metal and the car would not move. He got out to take a look and the right front wheel was turned completely sideways The dealership told us to bring it in. We had to hire a flat bed truck to get it there.so that was at our expense.When the flat bed truck driver came from another repair shop to help us, he immediately said \"Oh,you have a broken tie rod huh?\" We did not know. He said there is a rubber boot around the tie rods and our tie rod broke.My husband told the garage dealership this.They said they had never heard of that. BUT in taking it apart they discovered that was the case. We were without a car for 3 weeks as they had troubles locating a part. I wanted both sides fixed but they only fixed the one. They did give me the old part. It is a rusty, horrible looking piece of crap.  It looks like it is 100 years old.  It absolutely BROKE.  Here is my concern. What if my husband and I and our friends would have been in the car driving 65 down the highway? I know what would have happened.  There would have been deaths and severe injuries.THANK GOD it happened in our drive at home. We had no warning.Had there been an accident the report would have been \"the driver and his passengers were killed after the driver lost control of the car\". Never probably would have found this MAJOR LIFE THREATENING flaw in the car. How many accidents have there been with that conclusion. Did the driver really lost control or was there a major safety issue? I am scared to death to get in this car and go anywhere,Now we get a recall notice regarding possibility of a rear toe link fracture. REALLY? AND PARTS ARE UNAVAILABLE ACCORDING TO THE LETTER? Are we to park the car and wait for the parts to become available? we need a car to drive. Ford needs to replace or reimburse for these damaged vehicles. I feel very, very unsafe.",

They are currently duct taped onto the car to protect the car from any further damage. I believe since Ford acknowledged the failure and there was a need to create a new system/part, then this should be a recall of the current parts.

Looks like this is a huge problem ford has with its explorer rack and pinion failure I guess there waiting on somebody to get killed with faulty racks before they do anything. My explorer has 65000 miles on it and it looks like this is a common failure for this vehicle.",

The steering would be a little off but after turning the car on and off, it would reset and wouldn\u2019t happen again for a week or two. I took it in to the dealership to get a recall fixed and had them take a look at my actual steering issue (with videos and pictures of the problem) but they could not replicate the problem as the dashboard would reset. Fast forward to last Thursday when the problem was more persistent than normal. A few times in the last couple months or so, my steering wheel would LOCK UP completely because the power steering would give out and a few times I was ON A FREEWAY. I had to manually hand crank a very very stiff steering wheel and pull over which was extremely dangerous. Once I would, I would turn the car on and off again which then it would reset. The dashboard warning about the steering fault would come on more often than the steering wheel locking up but the several times it did lock it, proved a very dangerous situation.  It happened again this past week which I had to drive slowly to my local mechanic. Due to it being a power steering/programming issue, the recommended me going back to the dealership. At that point, my car would no longer reset the issue and I was unable to drive home that day because the power steering permanently gave out. Thank god I was at the mechanic already. Currently, I have the car towed to the dealership and they are working on the problem. Because my extended warranty ended 2k miles ago, I am supposed to pay $3800 out of pocket for this?? It should be a RECALL situation. Extremely dangerous. Forum related issue that I did research on and it seems to be a common problem!!! : https://www.carproblemzoo.com/ford/explorer/2016/steering-rack-and-pinion-problems.php  Please help make Ford do a recall for this dangerous issue!!",

The recall was due to vehicles experiencing a loss of power steering assist and required extra steering effort at lower speeds, increasing the risk of a vehicle crash.  I have a 2016 Ford Explorer and the issue appears to be occurring in later models like mine.  I experienced it on July 21, 2021.  I was driving on the freeway at 70mph and with no prior warning I my power steering goes out and I see the message \"power steering module failure\".  Luckily I was able to fight the car to the shoulder, but I can only imagine what would have happened if my wife or daughter had been driving at the time.  Ford needs to have a system failure alert added or better yet fix the issue from occurring, especially in a fairly new vehicle.",

The mechanic said this should never happen on a 76,803 mile car, let alone on a part such as the transmission. This was the second one her did in a two week period. This not only put our family out of a car, it posed a huge safety concerning not being able to move the vehicle. I would hate for this to happen to any owner who is not automotive educated.

I WAS ABLE TO FISHTAIL IT BACK ONTO THE ROAD, ALMOST ROLLED THE VEHICLE AND BARELY KEPT IT UNDER CONTROL.  I GOT OVER TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND CALL THE ANOKA COUNTY SHERIFF FOR ASSISTANCE.  A DEPUTY ASSISTED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE A FORMAL POLICE REPORT WAS FILED.  THIS WAS SUNDAY JULY 19TH.  WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO LOCAL MECHANIC WHO LOOKED AT IT THE FOLLOW DAY AND DETERMINED THAT THE TOE CONTROL LINK HAD BROKEN.  THEY REPAIRED IT WITH A NEW PART FROM THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AND THE VEHICLE SEEMED FINE.  LAST NIGHT THE NEW PART THAT THEY INSTALLED BROKE AS WELL.  I LOOKED ONLINE AND SEE THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PART, THE TOE CONTROL LINK ON 2011-2017 FORD EXPLORERS.  I CHECKED THE VIN ON THE NTSB WEBSITE BUT IT INDICATES THAT OUR CAR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  WE HAD BROUGHT THE CAR INTO METROPOLITAN FORD IN EDEN PRAIRIE EARLIER IN THE YEAR FOR OTHER RECALL ISSUES.  HAD THE RECALL BEEN COMPREHENSIVE, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT AND FIXED.  AT 65 MPH, MY DAUGHTER AND I SHOULD HAVE BOTH BEEN KILLED IN THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT.  IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE THE (NEAR) ACCIDENT AND WE ARE STILL SHAKEN UP BY IT.  FORTUNATELY, LAST NIGHT'S INCIDENT WAS AT MUCH SLOWER SPEED.  I AM FEARFUL THAT THERE ARE OTHER FAMILIES WHOSE LIVES IN DANGER AS WELL.

THE BACKUP CAMERA SUDDENLY APPEARED ON THE SCREEN IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND THE TRANSMISSION SHUDDERED SLIGHTLY.  I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE DASHBOARD DRIVE INDICATOR, WHICH NORMALLY IS LIT RED WHEN IN DRIVE, WAS WHITE, AS WERE ALL THE OTHER INDICATORS  (R, N, ETC).   I JIGGLED THE SHIFTER WITHOUT PRESSING THE SHIFTER BUTTON BUT THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE TRANSMISSION APPEARED TO BE STILL IN DRIVE SINCE THE CAR STILL HAD POWER AND WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN.  IT LASTED FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS AND THEN THE DISPLAY RETURNED TO NORMAL AND THE D INDICATOR RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL RED MODE.  ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER THE PROBLEM RETURNED AND STAYED FOR 10 TO 15 SECONDS AND THEN AGAIN REVERTED BACK TO NORMAL.  THIS BEHAVIOR REPEATED ONE OR TWO MORE TIMES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES.  AFTER THIS SERIES OF EVENTS THE CAR SEEMED TO BE NORMAL FOR THE REST OF MY 1.5 HOUR TRIP AND HAS BEEN FINE UNTIL AUG 13, 2016 WHEN THE SAME BEHAVIOR HAPPENED AGAIN.

THE SMELL WAS MAKING ME FEEL NAUSEOUS AND LIGHT HEADED. MY WIFE EXPLAINS THAT SMELL HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF, AND SHE CHALKED IT UP TO BEING PREGNANT AND HAVING A SENSITIVE SENSE OF SMELL. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD BEEN GETTING HEADACHES FREQUENTLY AND NAUSEA AS WELL. I OBSERVE THE SMELL IS COMING THROUGH THE AIR CIRCULATION SYSTEM AND THAT IT IS STRONGER IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. I THEN SHUT THE ENTIRE CLIMATE CONTROL OFF-NO AIR CIRCULATION AT ALL, AND THE SMELL IS STILL COMING IN THE VEHICLE. NOT AS INTENSELY, BUT STILL NOTICEABLE. AND THIS IS WHILE DRIVING OR PARKED. AFTER THIS I COMPLETED RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC AND FIND THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2011-2017 EXPLORERS AND THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING CO2 POISONING FROM THIS DEFECT. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION OR IN PARK, AIR ON OR OFF. THERE IS A HEAVIER SULFUR SMELL WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION. FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS AND I AM FRUSTRATED THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SAFETY RECALL. I CALLED THE FORD DEALER I BOUGHT THE EXPLORER FROM, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE 17-N03 REPAIR HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2018. CLEARLY THE 17-N03 REPAIR HAS NOT BEEN WORKING FOR ME OR OTHER FOLKS. FORD HAS PUT ANOTHER TSB OUT THAT IS APPARENTLY MORE THOROUGH. MY FORD IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP GETTING THE NEWEST FORD TSB REPAIR FOR THE EXHAUST/C02 ISSUE. MY TRUST IS LOST IN FORD AND FEEL THAT THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR PROFIT AHEAD OF BEING ETHICAL.

RENT A VEHICLE WHEN WE HAVE AN ALMOST BRAND NEW VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE WITH A $500 A MONTH CAR PAYMENT?!?! AGAINST OUR BETTER JUDGMENT, WE TOOK IT FROM PA TO FL, WELL ALMOST.

IT'S NOW ALMOST 3 WEEKS IN AND IT'S STILL IN SC. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOREIGN CAR PEOPLE. WE HAD A HONDA PILOT FOR 12 YEARS, NEVER A PROBLEM WITH IT. IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM, IT WAS COVERED BY THE AWESOME WARRANTY OR IT WAS A RECALL. LOTS OF RECALLS, MANUFACTURER AND HONDA. WHICH, UP TILL NOW I THOUGHT WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS! NOW, I GET THAT AT LEAST THEY HAVE ENOUGH INTEGRITY TO HAVE RECALLS! FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS THE WORST WARRANTY AND 0 INTEGRITY! WE LOVED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS VEHICLE.

AT 33,817 MILES I NOTICED A SECOND TIRE WAS FLAKING AND PEELING SO I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER I PURCHASED IT FROM.  TIRE WAS REPLACED UNDER HANKOOK \"WARRANTY\" AT 34,171.  CURRENTLY THE 2 OTHER TIRES ARE NOT SHOWING THE SAME DEFECT, YET. MY PRORATED COST FOR THE TIRE WAS $152.00 (TIRE FULL PRICE $212) AND I HAD TO PAY FOR MOUNT, BALANCE AND DISPOSAL.

I WILL REPLACE THEM USING A DIFFERENT TIRE MANUFACTURER WHEN THEY REACH END OF LIFE WHICH IS 2/32 AND PURCHASE FROM A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER.

I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A DESIGN FLAW LEADING TO THE EXHAUST FUMES RE-ENTERING THE VEHICLE THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM. THE ADVISOR INDICATED THEY WOULD NEED THE CAR FOR AT LEAST A WEEK TO RE-SEAL THE SYSTEM TO MINIMIZE THE PROBLEM. AFTER HAVING MY VEHICLE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, I RECEIVED IT BACK AND THE ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED. I RETURNED THE CAR TO FORD AND THEY ARRANGED FOR ME TO HAVE LOANER EXPLORER WHILE THEY WORKED ON MINE. IT HAD THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. MY EXPLORER WAS AT THE DEALER FOR WELL OVER A MONTH AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR FORD TO ENGINEER AND MANUFACTURE THE PARTS NEEDED TO FULLY RESOLVE THE EXHAUST LEAKS. AFTER FINALLY GETTING THE CAR BACK, THE ISSUE INITIALLY SEEMED TO IMPROVE, BUT QUICKLY RETURNED. THE DEALER HAS STATED THEY HAVE DONE ALL THEY CAN AND THAT NO OTHER FIX EXISTS. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND UNSAFE. I HAVE A WIFE AND 3 CHILDREN AND I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING WITH THEM IN THE VEHICLE BEYOND VERY SHORT TRIPS. WE'VE EVEN GONE SO FAR AS TO RENT VEHICLES FOR FAMILY ROAD TRIPS DUE TO THE ISSUES WITH OUR EXPLORER.",

FORD REPAIR ATTEMPTS DO NOT WORK!  NHTSA AND FORD NEED TO DETERMINE FIX OR RECALL VEHICLES.  EXHAUST FUMES CONTAIN CARBON MONOXIDE AS WELL AS MANY OTHER TOXIC CHEMICALS.  FORD ADMITS EXHAUST FUMES ENTERING VEHICLE BUT CLAIMS LOW VOLUME/SAFE.  PLEASE CONSIDER THAT INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN CANNOT BE EXPOSED TO SAME CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS AS ADULTS WITHOUT VERY SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING HARM.  ASK A DOCTOR, NOT FORD!!!",

ALL SCREENS AND DASH WERE BLACK, THEN I GET A \"BLIND SPOT FAULT\" WARNING AND \"CROSS TRAFFIC FAULT\" WARNING. SO, I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN AND IT APPEARED ALL SYSTEMS WERE GO. ALSO, MY USB AND POWER PORTS HAVE BEEN WITHOUT POWER FOR ABOUT THE LAST 3 WEEKS. I'M LITERALLY SCARED TO DRIVE THIS THING. EVERY TIME I GET IN IT, I WONDER IF IT'S GOING TO BREAK DOWN ON ME AGAIN (AND WHERE) AND WHAT THE PROBLEM WILL BE NOW. I WILL NEVER, LEASE OR PURCHASE A FORD PRODUCT AGAIN. HONEST TO GOD.

OCT 1ST  CAR TAKEN TO JCLEWIS FORD IN SAVANAH,GA, WAS CALLED BY THE DEALER APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS LATER AND WAS TOLD TO PICK THE CAR AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS TO REALIGN AND RESET COMPUTER SOFTWARE.   I TOOK THE CAR AND DROVE 39 MILES AND WE SUSTAINED A TOTAL REPEAT OF THE PROBLEMS. AT THIS POINT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY HAD NO IDEA AT POINT WHAT WAS WRONG OR THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, APPROXIMATELY FIVE DAYS LATER I WAS TOLD THE CAUSE WAS THE FAILURE OF THE REAR ABS WHEEL SENSOR WHICH THEY TOLD ME WAS REPLACED AND ALSO THAT THEY HAD DRIVEN THE CAR FOR FEW DAYS AND IT WAS NOW OPERATIONAL.  I DID PICK UP THE CAR AND AGAIN WITHIN A FEW MILES WE SUSTAINED THE SAME FAILURE WITH AN ADDED FEATURE I BACKED OUT OF MY PARKING SPACE AND FOUND THAT I HAD LOST ANY ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND THERE WAS A SEVERE GRINDING NOISE EMANATING FROM TRANSMISSION, DROVE THE BACK TO DEALER SHIP FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WAS TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD THAT THE FORD DEALER MECHANIC DID NOT REPLACE ANY PARTS AS I WAS TOLD.  AS OF TODAY SEPT 18TH THE CAR IS STILL WITH THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IN FACT REPLACED THE LEFT ABS WHEEL SENSOR BUT THEY SAID THAT IN FACT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM AND THAT IT STILL EXISTED. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE THINK IT IS BEING CAUSED BY SOME TYPE OF SHORT IN A WIRE HARNESS BUT THEY STILL ARE AWAITING PARTS.  I HAVE REQUESTED A MEETING WITH A FORD REPRESENTATIVE BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT HE COULD NOT ARRANGE A MEETING. I WAS TOLD BY A FORD REPRESENTATIVE I BELIEVE DETROIT THAT I SHOULD LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE OWNERS MANUAL FOR ADVICE ON THE LEMON LAW.",
