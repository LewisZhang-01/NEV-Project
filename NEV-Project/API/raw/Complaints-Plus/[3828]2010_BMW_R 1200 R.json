In fact, both cams (2-cylinder motorcycle) are made of plastic, which degrades over time, and failed simultaneously, leaving me without the use of the throttle.  This can be a catastrophic failure if happens at highway speeds or heavy traffic.  Luckily for me, it happened close to home and I was able to push the bike home.   As this is a frequent and common occurrence for BMW motorcycles equipped with BING carburetors with a plastic cam mechanism, it would seem appropriate to enact a recall for affected models.",
