The contact stated that while the vehicle was parked in his garage with the engine off, the contact turned on the accessory switch which caused the engine to start. Once the engine started, the vehicle began to roll backward with the driver-side door open which caused the contact to be knocked over. The contact was dragged with the vehicle out of his garage as the driver's side door was caught by a part of the house garage door jamb which folded the door. The driver door detached the vehicle as the driver-side window burst and damaged the interior door panel. The contact was able to roll free from the vehicle once it left the garage; the vehicle rolled into his neighbor's landscaping which caused the vehicle to stop. The contact suffered cuts and scrapes to the right side of his back, buttocks, arm, ankle, as well as, his left and right legs. The contact did not seek medical attention. A police report was not filed. The contact drove the vehicle back into the garage and later had it towed to an independent body shop. The contact called a dealer where they informed him that there were no recalls on his vehicle. The contact attempted to reach the manufacturer but was kept on indefinite hold.  The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 7,800.",

I did not notice anything until I started my drive home which was a 200 mile drive. the gas gauge was reading 1/4 tank of gas and dropped to empty. We stopped in at the gas station and filled the tank but once we did the gauge continued to read empty and a light displayed on the dash stating service fuel system. We continued to drive on our way home and we noticed a strong fuel odor inside the cabin of the car and distinctively from the driver side of the vehicle. I got the car home and noticed a few small drips in the garage that quickly evaporated. To the best of my knowldge I suspected that it was fuel. for the next week or so we did not drive the car but the garage smelled strongly of fuel. I parked it out side and the fuel smell in the garage went away. Odly after filling the tank a few more times the gauge began working again and the service fuel system message went away. It eventually showed an empty tank and then full again. I went to visit my local gm dealer to see if any recalls had been placed on my car over the years and they told me that there are no active recalls. However in my sear accross the forums I found gm bulletin 15682 (primary tank module flange fuel and vapor leaks) for my 2007 corvette. This bulletin was released in july 2016. perfectly matching the issue I am experiencing and was advised my member of many of the forums to file a concern with nhtsa. I have not yet had it inspected by the dealership because they want $1500.00 to inspect and repair because of the need to drop the drive train for proper access. I Would appreciate any assistance with this issue. I am scared to drive my care due to a fire related accident and it is my primary means of transportation.",

ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH GM, I WAS INFORMED FUEL PUMP WAS A KNOWN ISSUE. THE FUEL PUMP WAS THEN REDESIGNED TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE; HOWEVER, REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY FUEL PUMP WAS ONLY GIVEN A WARRANTY EXTENSION INSTEAD OF RECALL.

IN NEITHER CASE DID I EXPERIENCE ANY HANDLING ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE BUT AGAIN ONE TIME I WAS NOT MOVING AND THE SECOND ONLY TRAVELING AT 5 MPH SO IF ANYTHING SUCH AS AUTOMATIC BRAKE APPLICATION HAD OCCURRED I MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED IT.    I'VE RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND HAVE FOUND THAT MANY OTHER CORVETTE OWNERS (AND SOME CADILLAC XLR OWNERS) HAVE HAD THE SAME WARNING MESSAGE.  IN SOME CASES BRAKES ARE APPLIED AUTOMATICALLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AT HIGH SPREADS CREATING A REAL SAFETY ISSUE.      ONE POSSIBLE REMEDY PER GM IS TSB 06-02-35-002 (RECALL N100118, 10118).  BEING SAFETY RELATED I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS SERVICE USUALLY COSTS OWNERS.  ALSO THIS TSB STOPS AT THE 2006 MODEL YEAR AND I HAVE A 2007 THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DELIVERED IN OCTOBER OF 2006.

ONCE I GOT TO A SPOT WHERE I COULD MOVE OFF THE ROAD, I SHIFTED TO PARK AND RESTARTED THE CAR. IT THEN DROVE ON AS USUAL, BUT THERE WAS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR OTHER INDICATOR. THIS HAPPENED ONLY ONCE THIS DAY, HOWEVER OCCURRED THREE ADDITIONAL TIMES WITHIN 10 MILES ON THE 23RD OF JULY. I CONTACTED A GM SERVICE TECHNICIAN WHO WORKS AT A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND HE CHECKED FOR ANY SERVICE BULLETINS OR RECALLS. THERE WERE NONE FOR THE CORVETTE. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET, AND CORVETTE FORUM (I AM A 10 YEAR FORUM MEMBER). I FOUND NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF THE IGNITION SWITCH IN 2005-2007 CORVETTES FAILING IN THIS MANNER. I LOCATED AN IGNITION SWITCH AND REPLACED IT. THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM IN 15 MINUTES AND FOR LESS THAN $50 AT DEALER RETAIL.     I KNOW FROM OTHER NHSTC RECALLS ON VEHICLES THAT IGNITION SWITCH FAILURES ARE CONSIDERED A CRITICAL AND DANGEROUS FAILURE. THE FAILURES IN THE CORVETTES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THESE RECALLS. IF SUCH A FAILURE OCCURRED DURING CROSSING TRAFFIC OR WHILE DRIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY INTERSTATE TRAFFIC, THE RESULTS COULD EASILY BE (AND MAY ALREADY HAVE BEEN) DEADLY. PLEASE CONSIDER INITIATING A RECALL, OR INCLUDING THE AFFECTED YEARS OF CORVETTE IN AN EXISTING RECALL. MY CAR IS NOW FIXED DUE TO MY ABILITY TO SEARCH FORUMS AND OTHER WEB BASED INFORMATION, HOWEVER MOST CORVETTE OWNERS ARE NOT AS INVOLVED OR AS WEB SAVVY AND COULD BE INVOLVED IN A LONG DRAWN OUT PROBLEM/DIAGNOSIS PROCESS WHICH WOULD PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK.

UPON NEXT FILL-UP, THE SMELL PERSISTED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE FROM BEFORE DIAGNOSIS AT CHEVROLET DEALER.  APPROXIMATELY 7 WEEKS LATER, FUEL SMELL HAD WORSENED SLIGHTLY AND ALSO THE ENGINE WAS MAKING A \"CHATTERING\" SOUND.  SINCE CHEVROLET DEALER COULD NOT DETERMINE THE FUEL SMELL ISSUE CORRECTLY, I CHOSE A HIGHLY REPUTABLE INDEPENDENT SHOP AND THEY IMMEDIATELY FOUND THE PROBLEMS. THE \"CHATTERING\" SOUND WAS A FAULTY HARMONIC BALANCER, A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE CHEVROLET CORVETTE ENGINES AND COST ~$1,100 TO REPAIR USING CHEVROLET PARTS. THE FUEL SMELL WAS DUE TO A CRACKED DRIVER SIDE FUEL TANK (CORVETTES USE TWO FUEL TANKS) WHICH WAS EASILY FOUND BY THIS INDEPENDENT SHOP ONCE THE CAR WAS LIFTED. THE FACTORY-INSTALLED DRIVER SIDE FUEL TANK HAD SHRUNK AND CRACKED, TRAPPING THE FUEL PUMP INSIDE, THUS FORCING THE TANK AND PUMP TO BE REPLACED, ALONG WITH ALL RELATED SEALS AND PARTS. TOTAL TO REPAIR THESE FUEL RELATED ISSUES WAS ~2,700, FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF $3,803.27.
