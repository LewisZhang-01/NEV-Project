Also in the car was my wife and a young granddaughter who started crying.  So I had to exit the freeway and find a parking place where I could stop the engine and allow the Infotainment system reset and I could then select a normal volume.  This could have been the cause of an accident because all of my attention was turned to the electronics.  Freezes and non operation of the other features of these electronics has also occurred which causes the driver to turn his attention to getting things working again.

THE RECALL WAS TO REPROGRAM THE BRAKES, SO BRAKING WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THE BRAKE BOOSTER FAILED.  HOWEVER, THE RECALL DID NOT ADDRESS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS A FAULTY SECONDARY HYDRAULIC BRAKE ASSIST VACUUM PUMP.  I WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAD TWO TAHOES ALREADY HAVE A VACUUM BOOSTER FAILURE, WHICH RESULTED IN AN EXTREMELY HARD BRAKE PEDAL WHICH WOULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE.  THE PROBLEM ARISES DURING SLOW SPEED BRAKING, SUCH AS PARKING LOTS OR SLOW SPEED PATROL.    LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER TAKING THE VEHICLES TO CHEVY FOR THE RECALL, AN OFFICER WAS MANEUVERING SLOWLY IN A PARKING LOT.  THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED AN EXTREMELY HARD BRAKE PEDAL AND THE VEHICLE FAILED TO STOP.  THE OFFICER WAS ABLE TO TURN THE VEHICLE, BARELY AVOIDING A COLLISION.  OBVIOUSLY, GM'S BAND-AID RECALL DOES NOT FIX OR EVEN OVERRIDE THE PROBLEM.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AGREED THE RECALL WAS A PLACEBO AND THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE VACUUM BOOSTER.  AS PER A RECENT LETTER FROM GM, THEY HAVE GIVEN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE VACUUM PUMP, FOR FREE REPLACEMENT.  SO, OBVIOUSLY THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM.  THE LIABILITY PLACED ON MUNICIPALITIES, WHO HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO USE THEIR FLEET VEHICLES WITH KNOWN BRAKING ISSUES, IS AN UNFAIR BURDEN AND RISK.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY LOOKED AT IT AND TOLD ME YES ITS A KNOWN ISSUE BUT GM HAS NO REPAIR PROCEDURE YET FOR IT.THE VEHICLE HAS 89 MILES ON IT, HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THE WINDSHIELD IS PERFECTLY CLEAN AND NO OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE FRONT CAMERA.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID I WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT UNTIL THEY HAVE A FIX FOR IT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FRONT CAMERA RUNS MOST OF THE HIGHLY TOUTED SAFTEY FEATURES SUCH AS THE, FCA FORWARD COLLISION ALERT, LANE DEVIATION ALERT, EBS EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM, AND ON AND ON...... SO NOW THE $70K+ VEHICLE THAT WAS HYPED UP TO BE SOOO SAFE FOR MY FAMILY NOW HAS MOST OF THE SAFTEY FEATURES NON -FUNCTIONING AND GM  KNEW ABOUT THIS AND STILL CONTINUES TO SELL THE VEHICLE AND WONT REPAIR. THERE ARE ALSO MANY OTHER ELECTRICAL ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE, BUT WILL NOTIFY IN DIFFERENT REPORT. THIS IS TERRIBLE FOR A VEHICLE OF THIS CALIBER. IM A LOYAL AND DEDICATED PAST TAHOE OWNER BUT THIS ONE MAY BE GOING BACK. IM APPALLED THAT GM IS LETTING VEHICLES CONTINUE TO BE SOLD WITH KNOWN SAFTEY ISSUES ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY JUST GOT CAUGHT WITH THE WHOLE IGNITION SWITCH FIASCO.",
