AFTER THE BIKE COOLED DOWN AND THE OVERHEATING WARNING LIGHT WENT OFF, I TRIED TO START THE BIKE. NOTHING HAPPENED. I TRIED AGAIN AND THE BIKE WOULD NOT TURN OVER. THE PORT AUTHORITY POLICE CAME BY TO GIVE ME A HAND AND NOTHING WE COULD DO WOULD START THE BIKE. THIS WAS LESS THAN 2 HOURS AFTER A CERTIFIED TRIUMPH MECHANIC SWORE TO ME UP AND DOWN THAT THE BIKE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION AFTER HE PERSONALLY REPAIRED IT. I HAD TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY TOW TRUCK COME TO GET THE BIKE AND TOW IT BACK TO THE SHOP WHILE I JUMPED ON A BUS BACK TO NYC. THE FAILING OF THIS BIKE OCCURRED ON A VERY DANGEROUS STRETCH OF ROADWAY AND PUT ME IN HARMS WAY. AFTER I GAVE THE SHOP MANAGER A TONGUE LASHING HE HAD THE BIKE FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS. TREBOUR AND TRIUMPH DID NOTHING TO DEAL WITH THE OVERHEATING ISSUE EXCEPT TO REPLACE THE FAN FUSE. THE BATTERY WAS ALSO COMPLETELY SHOT AND REPLACED. (IF YOUR COUNTING THAT IS MY 3RD FACTORY BATTERY IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS) ALL OF THIS UNDER WARRANTY. JOE THE SHOP MANAGER ONCE AGAIN COULD NOT REPLICATE THE OVERHEATING ISSUE UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE I PICKED UP THE BIKE. HE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME HE FINALLY GOT IT TO OVERHEAT AND HIS SOLUTION...WAS TO CLEAN THE 10% OF THE RADIATOR THAT WAS A DIRTY FROM THE TIRE SPITTING UP ROAD DIRT AND RAIN WATER. AS YOU CAN GUESS...THAT DID NOT FIX THIS DANGEROUS OVER HEATING PROBLEM. *TR",

        "summary": "DRIVING DOWN A WELL MAINTAINED GRAVEL  ROAD, AT UNDER 20 MPH, I HIT A RUT, THE SUSPENSION BOTTOMED OUT AND I HEARD A TWANG SOUND.  A HUNDRED MILES OR SO LATER I GOT OFF THE BIKE AND FOUND THAT THE MAIN FRAME WHERE THE TWO MOLDED IN BRACKETS THAT CONNECT THE UPPER ARMS OF THE SUB FRAME TO THE MAIN FRAME HAD BROKEN OFF.  THE ONLY THINGS KEEPING THE SUB FRAME FROM COLLAPSING ONTO THE REAR TIRE AND CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE MOTORCYCLE WERE THE THREE 8MM IN DIAMETER SCREWS THAT HOLD THE GAS TANK ON THE BIKE AND LUCKILY TO THESE BRACKETS ALSO THE EXHAUST SYSTEM HELPED KEEP IT OFF THE WHEEL.  TRIUMPH REFUSES TO REPLACE THE FRAME, (AND THE VIN NUMBERS THAT IDENTIFY THE BIKE). AT THIS POINT THEY CLAIM THE BIKE WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BE DRIVEN ON ROUGH ROADS  (EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LONGER SUSPENSION TRAVEL THEN MOST STREET MOTORCYCLES) AND THAT IT IS MY FAULT FOR TAKING IT OFF THE PAVEMENT, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SIMILAR THINGS LIKE POT HOLES AND THE LIKE ON PAVED ROADS. IN SHORT EITHER THE FRAME IS INSUFFICIENTLY BUILT TO BE DRIVEN ON MANY OF OUR ROADS (THEIR CLAIM FOR THIS BREAKAGE) OR THERE IS A DEFECT IN THIS CASTING ON THIS SPECIMEN AND POSSIBLY OTHERS. (THE FRAME IS CAST ALUMINUM.) THE FIX IS TO EITHER WELD THE FRAME BACK TOGETHER AND ADD REINFORCEMENT OF SOME KIND, OR REPLACE THE ENTIRE MAINFRAME OF THE BIKE.  AT PRESENT I HAVE FABRICATED STEEL CLAMP ON BRACKETS AND HAVE MADE A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET THE MANUFACTURER TO REPLACE THE FRAME.  IF NOT I WILL SEE ABOUT GETTING THIS FRAME WELDED BACK TOGETHER AND LEAVE THE STEEL PIECES THERE AS BACK UP. I WOULD PROBABLY MOVE THE STEEL PIECES TO THE NEW FRAME AS WELL AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A FRAGILE SYSTEM TO HOLD ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE BACK PORTION OF A BIKE. I CAN FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OTHER TIGER HAS FAILED LIKE THIS. *TR",
