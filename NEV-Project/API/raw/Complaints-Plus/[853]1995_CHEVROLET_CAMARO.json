IT IS VERY UNREASOABLE THAT A DRIVESHAFT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT 26,000 MILES, OR THAT REAL AXELS ARE REPLACED THEN THEY LEAK AGAIN AND HAVE TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. I WAS TOLD TO DRIVE VEHICLE INTO DEALERSHIP WHEN IT WOULDN'T STOP AND WAS UNDER WARRANTEE. I MYSELF SCHEDULED A TOW, IT COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE THEY DIDN';T EVEN CARE.  I CALLED GMC, AND THEY DON'T CARE EITHER. I HAVE A LEMON THAT I AM AFFRAID OFF. I ALSO DID NOT GET THE KEYLESS ENTRY THAT CAME WITH THIS VECHICLE. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME I REALLY DIDN'T WANT IT ANYWAY. IT WAS TROUBLE BUT I PAID FOR IT. I NEVER GOT THE STICKER FROM THE WINDOW EITHER. I PAID 21,000 FOR THIS JUNK HEAP THAT IS A DANGER TO THE ROAD.  I AM 52 AND DRIVE CAREFULLY AND BABY THIS CAR. I TALKED WITH GMC, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. WHAT WILL BRAKE NEXT?  MY MECHANIC WAS APPALLED THAT THIS LAST THING. A DRIVE SHAFT ON A CAR FAILED WITH 26,000 MILES. SOMETHING IS WRONG.  *AK",
