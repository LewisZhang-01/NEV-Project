ALTHOUGH OUT VEHICLE HAS NOT HAD ANY COLLAPSE OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC FAILURE, SEVERAL OF THE OWNERS HAD EXPERIENCED SEVERE PROBLEMS AS A A RESULT OF THIS STRUCTURAL FLAW.  THE DEFECT WAS DESCRIBED MANY TIMES AS A RESULT OF A MANUFACTURING DETAIL, WHERE TWO SINGLE PIECES OF METAL WERE LAYERED TO BUILD THE STRUT TOWER. THE SEAM BETWEEN THESE TWO LAYERS OF METAL WAS NOT PROPERLY SEALED, AND AS A RESULT, MOISTURE WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE SEAM AND CORROSION INSIDE THE PLATE SANDWICH BEGAN.  WITH THE PROBLEM INSIDE THE METAL STRUCTURE ESSENTIALLY HIDDEN FROM VIEW, THE METAL DECAY COULD CONTINUE TO ADVANCE WITHOUT EASY DISCOVERY. THE TSB IS DATED NEARLY 2 YEARS AFTER THE LAST VEHICLE DATE, WITH WARRANTY COVERAGE ALREADY EXPIRED.  THIS IS A SERIOUS STRUCTURAL AND SAFETY PROBLEM, AND CHRYSLER IS NOT OFFERING TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFECT AND FIX THIS EXCEPT AT OUR COST. THIS MANUFACTURING DEFECT, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE UNUSUAL DAMAGE PATTERN AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL REPAIR KIT NEEDS A SAFETY RECALL TO SUPPORT OWNERS AND CORRECTLY ASSIGN FAULT. *TR",

ANYWAY, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT, IF THE STRUT TOWER FAILS DURING OPERATION, THE RESULT CAN BE DEVASTATING.  THERE ARE MANY YOUNG CHILDREN RIDING IN THESE VEHICLES, SOCCER MOMS ETC.  I FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT THERE IS NOT MORE VISIBLE INFORMATION ON THIS.  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF MY 1997, AND AT THE SAME PHONE AND ADDRESS AS WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  I HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED.

THIS SHOULD NOT BE MERELY A \"SERVICE\" RECALL, BUT A \"SAFETY\" RECALL.

SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE HEARD REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE RECALL ON THIS DEFECT AND I  WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THIS AS A POSSIBLE COVERED PROBLEM. WHEN I FILL THE GAS TANK, I CAN'T FILL OVER 3/4 TANK BECAUSE OF THE SMELL OF RAW GASOLINE IN THE INTERIOR. I'M AFRAID THAT IT IS AN ACCIDENT AWAITING TO HAPPEN AND I WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES.I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND I DON'T KNOW IF CHRYSLER HAS A RECORD OF THIS TRANSACTION. OH, BY THE WAY VOYLES REPORTED ON MY SERVICE RECORD THAT THE PARTS HAD BEEN ORDERED BUT AFTER 2 WEEKS I CALLED AND THEIR SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THEY HAD DROPPED THE BALL AND DIDN'T SEND THE ORDER IN.

AT THAT SAME TIME, I TRIED TO USE THE HORN TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT I WAS THERE TO PICK THEM UP.  THE HORN DID NOT WORK.  SINCE I DID NOT WANT TO PAY THE $70 FEE TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP \"DIAGNOSE\" THE PROBLEM (WITHOUT HAVING ANY OF THAT MONEY GO TOWARDS THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF THE REPAIR), I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO MY MECHANIC.  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT WORK ON ANY COMPONENT RELATED TO THE AIR BAG BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF REPLACING THE AIR BAG IN THE EVENT IT ACCIDENTALLY DEPLOYED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SINCE THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS ON, IT COULD EITHER NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN I NEEDED IT, OR THAT IT COULD DEPLOY WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND DID NOT NEED IT.  HE CONSIDERED IT A SAFETY ISSUE.  HE RECOMMENDED TAKING IT TO THE DEALER.  AFTER DOING MORE RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE PART IN QUESTION IS A CLOCKSPRING WIRING HARNESS AND THAT 124,511 VEHICLES HAVE HAD THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENT REPLACED BY CHRYLSER.  I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE, A RECALL ISSUE AND AN ECONOMIC ISSUE.  IF CHRYSLER CHARGES $70 PER DIAGNOSIS AND $250 FOR EACH REPAIR OF THE 124,511 DEFECTIVE CLOCKSPRING WIRING HARNESS/DESIGN  FLAWS, THAT EQUALS ABOUT $40 MILLION.

I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, STARTED THE VAN AGAIN, AND TRIED TO PROCEED.  THE VAN WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR.  I PULLED OFF AGAIN AND CALLED MY HUSBAND. HE CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT \"SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS AN ELECTRONIC PROBLEM\" AND IT WOULD BE SAFE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE HOME IN \"LIMP\" MODE.  THE VAN IS STILL IN THE SHOP.  WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE AN ELECTRONIC PROBLEM HAS NOW TURNED INTO A MAJOR PROBLEM.  IT SEEMS THAT SOME GEARS INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION BROKE.  THE ESTIMATED COST OF REPAIR IS $1500.00 OR HIGHER.  THE DEALER TOLD US THAT HE HAS NOT SEEN A PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS.  I WAS TOLD BY TWO DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION PLACES THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS.  SEVERAL SITES ON THE WEB ALSO LIST CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE TRANSMISSIONS.  THIS VAN HAS BEEN MAINTAINED PROPERLY SO I THINK IT IS UNREASONABLE FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL LIKE IT DID. THERE WERE NO WARNING SIGNS AT ALL.  WHAT UPSETS ME IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A MAJOR ACCIDENT IN A CASE LIKE THIS.  WHAT IF I HAD BEEN PASSING SOMEONE,  SOMEONE HAD BEEN TAILGATING ME, ETC.?

I STOPPED AT A LIGHT ( I WAS THE FIRST CAR AT THE INTERSECTION ) AND WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR, THE CAR MADE AN AWFUL GRINDING NOISE.  THE PERSON BEHIND ME ASSUMED THAT I WAS MOVING AND CAME WITHIN INCHES OF CRASHING INTO ME.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND TURNED IT OFF.  AS I STEPPED OUT (INTO TRAFFIC) I DID NOT SEE ANY DEBRIS OR LEAKAGE UNDERNEATH.  I TRIED PUTTING THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE.  I HAD TO CALL THE POLICE AND AAA TO TOW ME TO THE DEALER.  I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION. I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT UP WITH MY REPAIRS AND HAD NO PRIOR HISTORY OF SLIPPAGE.  I WAS TOLD THAT A PIN BECAME LOOSE AND THAT THE GEARS SIMPLY FELL OUT OF PLACE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE  DRIVING! THIS SCARED ME DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE A FAMILY AND MY LIFE WAS IN JEOPARDY WHILE DRIVING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SAFE FAMILY VEHICLE.  I COULD UNDERSTAND IF I HAD PRIOR WARNING SIGNS OF THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING, BUT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY WARNING IS ALARMING.  I HOPE THAT THIS IS NOT A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER.  I HAVE OWNED 5 CARS IN MY LIFETIME.  THEY HAVE ALL LASTED WELL INTO THE 100,000 MILE RANGE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS DUE TO MY DILIGENT MAINTENANCE. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE  IN WORKMANSHIP THAT CAN CAUSE A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC END TO A DRIVER OR A FAMILY(IES).  I HOPE THAT THIS ISSUE BE LOOKED INTO FURTHER, BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE.

I ASKED THE MECHANIC IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AND HE SAID NO THAT THERE IS NO WAY OF DETERMINING THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN OR BE ABLE TO PREVENT IT THROUGH PREVENTITIVE MAINTENANCE.  I AM THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT DOING 70MPH DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH MY FOUR CHILDREN IN THE CAR.  THE DAMAGE THAT THIS BOLT BREAKING CAUSED WHEN IT HAPPENED, CAUSED MY STEERING TO LOCK UP AND I WAS UNABLE TO TURN MY STEERING WHEEL AT ALL.  I HAD TO COAST TO A STOP ALONG SIDE THE ROAD.  HAD I BEEN TRAVELING THE HIGHWAY AND THAT HAPPENED, I DO NOT WANT TO THINK OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.  I HAVE TALKED WITH CHRYSLER CORP. AND THEIR POSITION IS THAT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER A WARRANTY, AND THAT AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO RECALL ON MY VAN FOR THIS PROBLEM, THEY WILL NOT COVER THIS REPAIR.  I DISAGREE WITH THAT DETERMINATION TOTALLY.  THIS IS A REPAIR THAT WAS CAUSED BY A DEFECT IN THEIR DESIGN AND THEREFORE IS A COST INCURRED TO ME THAT IS OUT OF MY CONTROL.  IT IS NOT LIKE I DID NOT TAKE CARE OF MY ENGINE OR BRAKES AND THEY FAILED ME, THAT WOULD BE IN MY CONTROL.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.   EVEN THOUGH I AM SURE IT IS VERY PROFITABLE FOR CHRYSLER IN THE LONG RUN (THEY ARE GETTING PEOPLE BACK OVER AND OVER IN REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION REPAIRS) IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND NEEDS TO BE HANDLED IMMEDIATELY.",
