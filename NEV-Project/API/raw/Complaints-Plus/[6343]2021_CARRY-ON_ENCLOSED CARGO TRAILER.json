        "summary": "I recently reported the tie down system used incorrect fasteners resulting in the D rings not being attached properly.  This could cause a load shift and the towing vehicle could loose control.  I cannot find the investigation but I wanted to download the photos.  The fasteners are for self tapping into steel and they were in the 3/4\" plywood floor with no holding power.  It needs to either have different fasteners for wood or placed specifically in a location that will anchor them into the steel beams below the ply floor.  I have a photo of the fasteners but the system will not let me upload it (not sure why, it is not too big of a file)",
