So I had the car moved to Millville dealership which finally after six months of having the car was diagnosed and by that time cooperate office said we missed the deadline. I was back and forth with the dealership and cooperate stating the issues. No one helped us I have documentation that when we brought the vehicle in to be diagnosed when it was moved to another dealership. No one has helped I reached out to cooperate multiple times and they stated there was nothing they can do. The car we now have back still with the engine knock that could lead to engine failure or catching on fire while driving.",

THIS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY STRESSFUL EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY.  THE CAR WAS IN OUR GARAGE JUST 30 MINUTES PRIOR AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A HISTORY OF ISSUES WITH SOME OTHER HYUNDAI VEHICLES WHICH I WASN'T AWARE OF UNTIL NOW BUT I DON'T SEE THAT MY CAR WAS LISTED AS A POSSIBLE RECALL FOR ELECTRICAL FIRES.  IT WAS MY ONLY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION AND EVERY PENNY I EARNED WAS USED TO PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE LESS THAN ONE YEAR AGO.  I DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE THAT WOULD COVER THIS SITUATION SO THIS IS A TOTAL LOSS.   PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW TO PROCEED AND ALSO WHERE TO FORWARD THE VIDEO AND PHOTO DETAILS.",

I BROUGHT IT TO MY DEALERSHIP (KING HUYNDAI AND DEERFIELD BEACH FLORIDA) AND THEY ADVISED THAT MY \"STEERING WHEEL COUPLER\" NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND THERE ARE NO RECALLS. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED HIM IF THERE ARE ANY POSSIBLE HAZARDOUS OR DANGEROUS ISSUES WITH THIS FAULTY STEERING WHEEL COUPLER. HIS RESPONSE WAS, \"ABSOLUTELY, YOUR STEERING WHEEL CAN LOCK UP AND CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT\"!  HE ALSO ADVISED ME THAT IF I DO NOT HAVE THIS REPAIRED ASAP IT CAN RESULT IN MY ENTIRE ELECTRICAL STEERING SYSTEM TO ALSO BREAK & NEED REPLACEMENT. HE ALSO ADDED, \"IF THAT HAPPENS I WILL END UP SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY FOR THAT REPAIR ALSO\"!  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON MY OWN AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS BAD \"COUPLER\" IS MADE OF ONLY PLASTIC!! THE AVERAGE COST IS ONLY ABOUT $10 FOR A NEW ONE. THE DEALERSHIP WANTED TO CHARGE ME OVER $300.00 (OUT OF THE DOOR) FOR THIS SPECIFIC REPAIR. THIS GAP AND CLUNKING SOUND HAPPENS WHILE THE CAR IS TOTALLY STOPPED (BUT STILL RUNNING) AND ALSO DURING NORMAL AVERAGE DRIVING.  THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE AND I TRANSPORT MY THREE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THIS VEHICLE. I AM SO SCARED TO DRIVE IT NOW, I AM TRYING TO FIND OTHER TRANSPORTATION METHODS. ALSO, WHILE DRIVING I AM ABLE TO FEEL EVEN THE SMALLEST PEBBLE UNDER A TIRE AND THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES AND TRULY DOES NOT FEEL SAFE AT ALL AND IS VERY SCARY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF THIS IS SUCH A DANGEROUS MATTER REGARDING THE SAFETY OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE, WHY WOULD THEY USE ONLY PLASTIC FOR THIS COUPLER AND NOT SOMETHING MORE RIGID AND STABLE WITH NO WORRIES OF ANY WEAR?",

THE CLOCK SPRING SHOULD LAST HE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, THUS THE 15 YEARS EXTENDED WARRANTY. HYUNDAI SHOULD DO GOOD BY ITS CUSTOMERS AND FIX ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES. EXTENDED WARRANTY IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN A FULL BLOWN RECALL. ONE LAST THING, THIS PROBLEM IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IS DISABLES THE ENTIRE AIRBAG SYSTEM. THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE ALSO AFFECTED, THE CRUISE CONTROL BUTTON A MIXED UP, THE CANCEL BECAME SET FOR EXAMPLE WHICH COULD BE QUITE DANGEROUS. OTHER BUTTONS DON'T WORK AT ALL OR ALL THE TIME.   THIS IS MY SECOND HYUNDAI VEHICLE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE THE LAST. VERY FRUSTRATING.",

THIS IS A CAR DEFECT, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. FURTHERMORE, THE DEALER WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT IS A RECALL ON THE HYUNDAI SONATA BUT NOT ON THE ELANTRA.

I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER  FOR A SERVICE CHECK 2 DAYS AGO (I BOUGHT THE CAR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO), AND THEY SAID THAT THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE IN THIS CAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS MODEL; IT'S THE WAY THE REAR AXLE WAS DESIGNED AND THERE'S NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I ASKED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO CHECK THE SUSPENSION AND STRUTS AS WELL. THEY SAID THOSE WERE FINE BUT THEY \"TIGHTENED IT UP\". I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS IF IT WAS FINE IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOW I'M STUCK WITH DRIVING A CAR THAT I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING ON THE ROAD IN ALL CONDITIONS. MY TIRES HAVE SUFFICIENT TREAD ON THEM, SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE EITHER. I WANT HYUNDAI TO INVESTIGATE THE COMPLAINTS OF THE 2013 ELANTRA LIMITED EDITION.",

MY FATHER CAME AND THE CAR STARTED RIGHT UP AND DROVE FINE.  TWO WEEKS LATER SAME THING.  MY MOTHER CAME TO GET ME AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE, THERE WAS NO POWER TO CAR BUT KEYS WERE STUCK IN ON POSITION AND CAR WAS STILL IN GEAR AS I HAD TO PULL EMERGENCY BRAKE TO GET THE CAR TO STOP.  THE CAR WOULD NOT START AND WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER.  MY MOTHER TOLD TOW TRUCK DRIVER THAT BATTERY WOULD MOST LIKELY BE DEAD AS THE CAR HAD BEEN SITTING IN ON POSITION WAITING FOR TOW AND THEN TRIP TO DEALER.  DEALER STATED BAD BATTERY AND CAR WAS OUT OF GAS.  ALTHOUGH NO GAS WAS ADDED TO CAR BUT THEY PERFORMED ALL THEIR TESTS AND UPDATES TO ECM PER MANUFACTURER WITH CAR OUT OF GAS (BUT RUNNING).  REPLACED BATTERY AND CAME OUT OF WORK NOT LONG AFTER AND CAR WOULD NOT START.  I HIT STEERING WHEEL IN FRUSTRATION AND TRIED AGAIN AND CAR STARTED.  DROVE IT HOME, LEFT IT IN ACCESSORY POSITION, LOST POWER.  DID SAME THING AS BEFORE WITH HITTING STEERING WHEEL, STARTED AGAIN.  RECENTLY MOVED AWAY TO COLLEGE, DROVE IT ALL DAY, WENT BACK TO MY PARENT'S HOUSE FOR A COUPLE HOURS WENT TO LEAVE AND THE KEYS WOULD NOT TURN (COULD NOT EVEN GET STEERING WHEEL UNLOCKED), IT SAT OVERNIGHT AT MY PARENTS FOR AT LEAST ONE NIGHT MAYBE TWO WHILE I DROVE MY MOTHER'S CAR.  THE ORIGINAL DEALER CAME TO TAKE IT BACK AND SEE IF HE COULD FIGURE IT OUT, STARTED THE FIRST TIME HE TRIED TO START IT.  TURNED IT OFF AND TRIED AGAIN AND HE COULD NOT GET STEERING WHEEL TO UNLOCK AND KEY TO TURN, WAITED A COUPLE MINUTES AND TRIED AGAIN AND IT HAS BEEN RUNNING FINE SINCE.  THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM IS WILLING TO LET ME TRADE THE CAR BACK TO HIM FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF I CAN FIND SOMETHING I WANT BUT I LOVE MY CAR.",

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A ROCK OR FLYING DEBRIS FROM THE ROAD THAT CAME THRU THE WINDSHIELD. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND NOTICED THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE CRACKS AND POINT OF BREAKAGE WAS FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CAR. THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE IMPACT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD, NOT EVEN A MINOR SCRATCH TO INDICATE SOMETHING HAD HIT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THERE WERE SEVERAL PIECES OF GLASS ON THE INSIDE WHERE THE METAL PIECE BROKE OFF WITH SOME GLASS STILL GLUED TO IT. THE PIECE THAT CONNECTED THE MIRROR TO THE METAL PIECE SHATTERED INTO 3 PIECES. I AM UNSURE OF WHAT CAUSED THIS, BUT IT  IS CONCERNING TO KNOW THIS COULD HAPPEN TO OTHER DRIVERS.",

THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS NOW. TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY STATED THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM AS THE CAR STARTED FOR THEM EVERY TIME APPARENTLY AND COULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO SOLVE MY ISSUE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMITTEDLY TIGHTENED UP TERMINALS FOR THE BATTERY. THE CAR SEEMED TO START EVERY SINGLE TIME FOR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE VISIT, AND NOW IT'S DOING IT AGAIN.  CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ISSUE.  I'VE RESORTED TO TAKING VIDEO TO HELP DESCRIBE THE ISSUE TO TECHNICIANS, AND THE LATEST DEALERSHIP BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT THEY STILL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE MY VIDEO BUT WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM THEMSELVES.  THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY BAD IF I'M STUCK IN SOMEWHERE BECAUSE MY CAR WON'T START AND HYUNDAI CLAIMING THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.",

I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IN A CRASH IN A HYUNDAI. I WROTE TO HYUNDAI ABOUT SAFETY CONCERNS OF THEIR HYUNDAI ELANTRAS, THEIR RESPONSE WAS UNACCEPTABLE: \"WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE DESIGN OF THE 2013 ELANTRA AND WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY DISAPPOINTMENT THIS HAS CAUSED YOU.  THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO ALL APPROPRIATE PARTIES WITHIN HYUNDAI FOR REVIEW, INCLUDING HYUNDAI MANAGEMENT.\" REALLY HYUNDAI!

AFTER STOPPING TO GET AIR I DISCOVERED THE TIRE WAS COMPLETELY FLAT, AND I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON A FLAT TIRE. BOTH TIMES THE RIM WAS ALSO BENT AND HAD TO BE SENT TO A SHOP TO REPAIR IT (MORE MONEY AND MORE TIME AWAY FROM MY CAR AND PAYING FOR A RENTAL CAR). IT WAS THE SAME EXACT SITUATION BOTH TIMES. I DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING OR RUN OVER ANYTHING. IN TOTAL, THIS IS THE FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THIS TIRE DURING THE DURATION OF THE CAR'S LIFE, AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN DUE TO HITTING ANYTHING OR RUNNING OVER ANYTHING. IT JUST MYSTERIOUSLY HAPPENS. I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN OCT 2012 AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 57000 MILES ON THE CAR. THIS IS A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE IN TERMS OF COST AND TIME, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, I CONSTANTLY FEAR AND DREADFULLY ANTICIPATE THE NEXT TIME I WILL HAVE A FLAT AND NEVER FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE WHEN DRIVING. I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT THE USE OF 17\" WHEELS ON THIS CAR IS NOT APPROPRIATE, AND I WOULD LIKE FOR THIS TO BE LOOKED INTO, AS NO ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY HELP FROM HYUNDAI.

THE DEALER FINALLY FINISHED THE REPAIR WORK AND RETURNED THE CAR TO ME ON APPROXIMATELY JULY 31, 2015. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE ESC AND EPS LIGHTS WOULD GO ON INTERMITTENTLY AND STAY ON FOR A DAY OR SO BEFORE RETURNING TO NORMAL. I TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER LAST THURSDAY, SEPT 27, 2015 TO RESET THE COMPUTER AND SET THE STEERING ANGLE SENSORS WHICH I HAD READ ABOUT HELPING ONE PERSON IN THIS BLOG. IT WAS SEEMINGLY NORMAL WHEN I TOOK IT TO THEM. THE CAR WARRANTY WAS VOIDED BEFORE I GOT IT DUE TO A PRIOR COLLUSION IN WHICH A PRIOR INSURANCE COMPANY WROTE IT OFF AS COSTING MORE TO FIX THAN IT WAS WORTH. A BODY SHOP PURCHASED IT AND DID THE REPAIRS AND IT IS NOW CLASSIFIED A RESTORED SALVAGE TITLE (HENCE NO MORE WARRANTY) EVEN THOUGH WAS INSPECTED BY THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND DEEMED COMPLETELY FIXED. I PAID TO HAVE THE COMPUTER RESET AND THE STEERING ANGLE SENSORS ADJUSTED. THE DEALER BELIEVED THIS WOULD FIX IT. TWO DAYS LATER THE ESC AND EPS LIGHTS WENT BACK ON AND HAVE STAYED ON FOR 4 DAYS NOW. I HAVE A CODE READER AND THERE ARE NO FAULT OR ERROR CODES TO CLEAR BUT THE LIGHTS STAY ON. I AM SOMEWHAT CONVINCED THAT THE STEERING COLUMNS THAT HOUSE THE STEERING ANGLE SENSORS ARE FAULTY. WHEN THEY MALFUNCTION, IT MAKES THE EPS SHUT DOWN. A RECALL TO INCLUDE THESE WOULD BE GREAT. I CANNOT AFFORD ANY EXPLORATORY REPAIRS AT THIS TIME AND CANNOT DRIVE THE 2013 CAR. PLEASE HELP!",

I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF DRIVING THIS CAR AFTER ALL THE REVIEWS AND COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ WITH THIS SIZE WHEEL ON THIS CAR.  TO CHANGE OUT THE WHEEL/RIM AND ADD 4 NEW TIRES I AM LOOKING AT WELL OVER $1200 IN COST.  I SHOULD STILL BE DRIVING WITH THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON THIS CAR AND STILL HAVE SUFFICIENT TREAD, NOT DEALING WITH BLOWOUTS, BENT WHEELS, LEAKING TIRES, AND BULGING TIRES.  IT IS NOT THE TIRE BUT THE TIRE/WHEEL RATIO THAT CAUSES THIS ROAD HAZARD WITH THE WHEELS/TIRES AND THIS IS HOW THE CAR IS MANUFACTURED FROM HYUNDAI!  MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONTACTED THEM AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS ISSUE BUT HYUNDAI SAYS IT IS THE TIRE MANUFACTURER.  IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT BRAND OF TIRE YOU PUT ON THIS CAR THE WHEEL/TIRE RATIO IS WHAT CAUSES THE DANGER AND PROBLEMS.  HYUNDAI NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE IN THIS WAY.",

THEY DID AN ALIGNMENT CHECK AND CONFIRMED THAT EVERYTHING IS \"NORMAL.\" WELL EVERYTHING IS NOT \"NORMAL.\" MY GIRLFRIEND IS 8 MONTHS PREGNANT AND IS DRIVING AROUND IN A VEHICLE THAT IS VERY UNSAFE.

THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD DUE TO GUARD RAILS, SO I SLOWED DOWN AND CONTINUED DOWN THE HILL UNTIL I COULD PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THERE WAS NO CELL PHONE SERVICE AND THIS CAR HAS NO SPARE TIRE. THE TIRE WAS NOT COMPLETELY FLAT AND A NAIL WAS SEEN IN A REPAIRABLE AREA OF THE TREAD ON THE DRIVER SIDE REAR TIRE. THE MANUFACTURER PROVIDES FREE ROAD SERVICE, BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO CELL PHONE SERVICE, I HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO USE THE PROVIDED TIRE REPAIR AND INFLATION KIT. THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOLLOWED AND THE TIRE WAS INFLATED TO 32 PSI AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS. I DISCONNECTED THE TIRE REPAIR AIR PUMP FROM THE VALVE STEM AND MY WIFE WAS ABOUT TO REPLACE THE VALVE STEM CAP WHEN THE TIRE EXPLODED AND FORCE FROM THE AIR KNOCKED HER TO THE GROUND AND ONTO THE ROADWAY. SHE SKINNED HER KNEES AND HAD A HEADACHE FOR HOURS AFTER THIS. THE FORCE OF THE TIRE EXPLOSION ALSO SHATTERED THE WHEEL WELL PLASTIC LINER. HAD THE TIRE EXPLOSION BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRE MY WIFE WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN GRAVELY INJURED. THE LOUD SOUND FROM THE TIRE EXPLODING GOT THE ATTENTION OF A RANCH CREW REPAIRING FENCES IN THE AREA. THEY SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE A SHOTGUN BLAST. ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS OFFERED US USE OF HIS PHONE TO CALL FOR HELP. WE SPENT 2 HOURS IN THE HEAT ARRANGING FOR A TOW AND WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST TIRE SHOP THAT HAD THE CORRECT SIZE TIRE FOR SALE. THIS WAS OVER 25 MILES AWAY IN PINETOP, AZ. I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI NUMEROUS TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT FOR THEM TO COMPENSATE ME FOR THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND INJURY TO MY WIFE CAUSED BY THEIR TIRE REPAIR KIT WITHOUT ANY REASONABLE RESPONSE FROM THEM.

SHE CALLED ME IMMEDIATELY AND  I SHOWED UP TO CHANGE THE TIRE.  I NOTICED A LARGE HOLE IN THE OEM HANKOOK OPTIMO TIRE AND I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER (HYUNDAI INLAND EMPIRE) FOR REPAIR.  THE HOLE WAS TOO BIG TO REPAIR AND I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE TIRE.  TWO HOURS LATER THE SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED ME AND STATED THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE RIM BECAUSE IT WAS CRACKED.  THE COST OF REPLACEMENT WAS $399 FOR THE RIM AND $153.67 FOR THE TIRE. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE RIM WAS CRACKED.  THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT MECHANISM TO CRACK THE RIM.  THIS WAS A SIMPLE FLAT TIRE ON A HIGH TRAFFIC, 30 - 40 MPH STREET, AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.  BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS WERE IN THE CAR AND BOTH CONFIRM THAT THEY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY.  THERE WAS NO TIRE SIDEWALL DAMAGE AND NO EVIDENCE OF RIM DAMAGE.  I HAVE OWNED 8 CARS IN MY LIFETIME AND HAVE HAD SEVERAL FLAT TIRES, AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A CRACKED RIM.

I CALLED THE HYUNDAI 24 HOUR ROADSIDE AND HAD THEM TOW IT TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER INITIALLY TRIED TO START IT, AND IT DIDN'T. HE POPPED THE BUTTON NEAREST THE TOP OF THE SHIFTER AND PRESSED IT IN, AND PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, IT THEN STARTED BUT SPUTTERED LIKE IT WANTED TO TURN OFF. HE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR ONTO THE TOW TRUCK.  THE NEXT MORNING, I SPOKE WITH THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP WHO INDICATED THAT THE CAR WAS STARTING FOR THEM JUST FINE. HE SAID THERE ARE SO MANY SENSORS THAT IT COULD BE ONE, BUT THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO START AS THERE ARE SO MANY AND COULD NOT MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS. HE WANTED TO KEEP IT OVERNIGHT TO SEE IF IT WOULD ACT UP FOR THEM. IT IS NOW 2PM TWO DAYS LATER AND THE MECHANIC CLAIMS THERE IS STILL NO ISSUE, HE SAID THEY HAVE LET IT RUN ALL MORNING AND IT IS FINE.

I TOOK A LOOK AT THE REAR TIRES AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP AND NOTICED IT WAS A VERY UNEVEN AND IRREGULAR TIRE WEAR PATTERN SO I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE I NEEDED TO ROTATE MY TIRES MORE OFTEN (TIRES WERE ROTATED EVERY 3000 MILES WHEN OIL WAS CHANGED) AND THAT WAS WHY THE IRREGULAR WEAR ON ONLY THE 2 REAR TIRES. THE WEAR APPEARED AS WAVY SPOTS WHERE THE TIRE HAD NO TREAD THEN RIGHT NEXT TO THAT IT HAD PLENTY OF TREAD LEFT. SO I GAVE IN BOUGHT ALL 4 BRAND NEW TIRES AND AFTER 1500 MILES I WENT AHEAD AND ROTATED THE TIRES NOTICING THAT THE REAR TIRES HAD ALREADY BEGAN TO WEAR IN THE EXACT SAME PATTERN SO I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A BAD SET OF TIRES. NEEDLESS TO SAY I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL TIRE SHOP AND HAD THEM CHECK THE ALIGNMENT ON THE BACK TIRES EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SOLID REAR AXLE. THE ALIGNMENT CHECK SHOWED THAT THE REAR WHEELS DO NOT TRACK STRAIGHT AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING THE REAR TIRES TO WEAR VERY FAST. I TOOK THIS INFORMATION BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH REFUSED TO CHECK THE ALIGNMENT ON THE REAR WHEELS BECAUSE IT IS A SOLID AXLE VEHICLE AND THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT FOR IT. THEY CONTINUED TO BLAME THE TIRES AND ROTATION SCHEDULE FOR THE PROBLEM. AFTER DOING MORE RESEARCH ON THE WEB THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THE HYUNDAI ELANTRAS AND THE DEALERSHIPS REFUSE TO FIX IT EVEN KNOWING THAT PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE. IF A TIRE ENDS UP BLOWING OUT DUE TO THE REAR AXLE NOT BEING MOUNTED CORRECTLY I COULD SEE THAT BEING A BIG PROBLEM.  *TR",

AFTER A FEW WEEKS, I NOTICED THAT THE NOISES WHERE NOTICEABLY LOUDER, ALONG WITH A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE WHEN I TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL. THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM (UNIVERSAL HYUNDAI IN ORLANDO) WAS BOOKED UP SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT ORLANDO HYUNDAI. SHORTLY AFTER BRINGING MY CAR IN, AND HAVING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOOK AT THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR WAS SOLD TO ME DEFECTIVE, THAT \"THE LEFT AND RIGHT INNER TIRE RODS AND LOCK NUTS WERE LOOSE, THREADS WERE DAMAGED, AND THE LOCK NUTS WERE LEFT LOOSE FROM THE FACTORY\". THE SERVICE MANAGER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, AND THAT \"ONE TIRE WOULD'VE WENT ONE WAY AND THE OTHER TIRE WOULD'VE WENT THE OTHER WAY, CAUSING YOUR CAR TO COME TO A SUDDEN HALT\". THIS MIGHT HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, AND KNOWING THAT I WAS DRIVING THAT CAR ON THE HIGHWAY, TAKING TRIPS WITH MY FAMILY AND CHILDREN, WHILE THE CAR WAS DEFECTIVE WAS VERY SCARY AND UPSETTING. I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT PURCHASING A NEW CAR, AND HOPED THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH HYUNDAI.

CALLED HYUNDAI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY SENT SOMEONE TO JUMP IT.  CAR STARTED AND TOOK IT TO MOTORWORLD WILKES-BARRE WHERE I HAD PURCHASED CAR.  THEY TURNED CAR OFF AND WAITED 5 HOURS. CAR STARTED AGAIN AND THE MAN IN SERVICE TOLD ME THAT HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING SINCE THE BATTERY WAS FINE AND HE DIDN'T SEE ANY ISSUE. IF I WANTED BATTERY OR SENSORS REPLACED, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR IT. I WAS TOLD IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN, HAVE IT TOWED IN WITHOUT LETTING IT BE JUMP STARTED. ONLY DIAGNOSTIC DONE WAS CHECK OF BATTERY WHICH READ AS NO PROBLEM.  ON 26 MAY 2013, (7400 MILES)  AGAIN I WENT OUT TO START CAR AND AGAIN IT WOULD NOT START.  AS I COULD NOT MISS WORK AND IT WAS MEMORIAL DAY WITH SERVICE DEPT AT DEALERSHIP CLOSED, HAD CAR JUMP STARTED AND WENT TO DEALERSHIP ON MY LUNCH BREAK.  WHILE THERE, SALESMAN WHO SOLD ME CAR HAD ME TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC SETTING FOR HEADLAMPS.  WHEN I DID THAT, IT ALSO CAUSED THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR BLUE TOOTH AND RADIO CONTROL TO NO LONGER FUNCTION.   I WAS TOLD THERE WAS RECALL ON BRAKE STOP SWITCH?

I IMMEDIATELY PULLED INTO THE NEAREST TIRE SHOP AND HAD THE TIRE PRESSURE CHECKED ON ALL 4 TIRES AND THEY WERE ALL FINE. THE MECHANIC SUGGESTED I HAVE MY DEALERSHIP TAKE A LOOK AND POSSIBLY HAVE THEM RESET THE SENSORS. UPON MY ARRIVAL HOME, I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A REASON FOR THE SENSORS GOING OFF. THE ISSUE PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS CAUSING ME TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS AT THE DEALERSHIP. THEY EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TO KEEP MY CAR FOR OVER A WEEK, DRIVE IT SEVERAL MILES AND REPLACE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM INCLUDING ALL FOUR TIRE SENSORS. DESPITE THIS, THE TPMS LIGHT STILL FLASHES. THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONVINCE ME THAT USB AND AUX CORDS IN MY CAR (USED WITH MY PHONE) ARE CAUSING A SIGNAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE SENSORS. IN MY OPINION THAT IS A BOGUS EXCUSE. THE CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE THE FEATURES IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO COEXIST. THE DEALERSHIP HAS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO REASSURE ME THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR AND IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE EVEN WHILE THE TPMS LIGHT IS FLASHING. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS EITHER AS I CONSTANTLY HAVE A SAFETY FEATURE ALERTING ME TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE. I HAVE TOLD THE DEALERSHIP AND HYUNDAI HEADQUARTERS THAT I BELIEVE THIS CAR IS A LEMON ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THEY INFORMED ME THAT A CAR IS ONLY A LEMON AFTER HAVING THE SAME ISSUE FIXED 3 TIMES. THUS FAR I HAVE HAD MY TPMS FIXED TWICE. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT ALL DRIVING THIS CAR WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL FEATURES.  *TR",

NO OTHER CAR MANUFACTURE HAS MANDATED ALL THIS ILLUMINATION DURING DAYTIME HOURS. ON AUGUST 3RD 2012 AT 11:40AM I WAS ISSUED A MOVING VIOLATION BY A LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICER IN THE CITY OF VAN NUYS, C.A. I WAS CITED FOR VIOLATING CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE SECTION 24800 WHICH STATES \"NO VEHICLE SHALL BE DRIVEN AT ANY TIME WITH THE PARKING LAMPS LIGHTED EXCEPT WHEN THE LAMPS ARE BEING USED AS TURN SIGNAL LAMPS OR WHEN THE HEADLAMPS ARE ALSO ILLUMINATED\". I EXPLAINED THE SCENARIO TO MY LAWYER AND HE ADVISED ME THAT THE CITATION IS VALID BECAUSE IN C.A. THE WORD HEADLAMPS IN VC SECTION 24800 IS INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS AS THE VEHICLES PRIMARY SOURCE OF FORWARD ILLUMINATION AND DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS DO NOT FALL INTO THIS PRIMARY SOURCE CATEGORY. TO AVOID FUTURE CITATIONS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU OPERATE ANY 2013+ HYUNDAI PRODUCT DO NOT USE THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHT FEATURE BECAUSE THE PARKING LIGHTS WILL LIGHT UP AND YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CITATION. I ADVISED HYUNDAI VIA A RECORDED PHONE CALL ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. IF THEY DO NOT TAKE PROPER ACTION TO CORRECT THIS THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED NEGLIGENT.   *TR",
