ON ONE OCCASION, THIS PAUSE OCCURRED DURING A LEFT HAND TURN ACROSS OPPOSING TRAFFIC AND NEARLY CAUSED A COLLISION.     IN SUMMER 2010 AUDI REPLACED THE MECHATRONIC UNIT UNDER WARRANTY AND REFLASHED THE DSG.  THIS FIXED THE ISSUES FOR 1-2 MONTHS, HOWEVER THE PROBLEMS HAVE SINCE REAPPEARED.

MOVING FROM A STOP, EITHER IN FORWARD OR REVERSE.  WITH LIGHT THROTTLE INPUT, SIMILAR TO IN PARKING SITUATIONS OR SLOW MOVING STOP/GO TRAFFIC, THE CAR/TRANSMISSION FEELS LIKE IT'S NOT ENGAGED AND THEN SUDDENLY ENGAGES AND LURCHES FORWARD/BACKWARDS.  THIS IS WHEN I FEEL THE CAR IS MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.    2.) WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO A STOP (SUCH AS AT A STOP LIGHT/SIGN OR FOR TRAFFIC), THERE IS AN ABRUPT THUD WHICH APPEARS TO BE WHEN THE CAR IS DOWNSHIFTING AUTOMATICALLY INTO 2ND GEAR.  THIS FEELS LIKE IT'S DOING DAMAGE TO THE CAR.    3.) WHEN SLOWING DOWN, FOLLOWED BY MILD ACCELERATION (SUCH AS WHEN TURNING RIGHT/LEFT ONTO A PERPENDICULAR STREET WITHOUT REQUIRING A STOP), THE CAR HESITATES, THEN REVS VERY HIGH (APPEARS TO CHOOSE TOO LOW OF A GEAR), IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY GOING INTO THE \"RIGHT\" GEAR.  THIS IS ALARMING TO DRIVER/PASSENGER AND IS ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING.
