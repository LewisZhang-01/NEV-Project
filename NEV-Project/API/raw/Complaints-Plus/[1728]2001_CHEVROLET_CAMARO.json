I CONTACTED MY DEALERSHI AGAIN AND WAS TOLD  (OFF THE RECORD, OF COURSE) THAT THE OEM ROTORS FOR THE CAMARO ARE POORLY DESIGNED AND DON'T MATCH UP WITH THIS CAR.  THEY ADVISED ME TO PURCHASE AN AFTERMARKET SET OF ROTORS FROM AN AUTOMOTIVE PARTS STORE AND NOT TO USE OEM PARTS.  THEY ALSO WILL NOT WARRANTY THE ROTORS A SECOND TIME.  CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE DEALERSHIPS ARE TELLING THE CUSTOMERS THAT THE STOCK ROTORS ARE NOT MATCHED TO THE CAR, CHEVROLET SHOULD ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.  IF THE ROTORS ARE WARPING PREMATURELY, THEN THEY ARE MOST CERTAINLY SUBJECT TO PREMATURE FAILURE AND COULD CAUSE A FATAL ACCIDENT.  I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH PROBABLY 50 OTHER DOCUMENTED CASES OF THE OEM ROTORS WARPING AT AN ACCELERATED RATE.  I'M HOPTING THAT NHTSA CAN PUT SOME PRESSURE ON GM TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE IT CAUSES A FATALITY.*AK",
