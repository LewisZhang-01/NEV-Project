My car has a problem where it is burning through the oil, I've had numerous mechanics try to figure out what is causing it but, nothing. I would get an oil change today and before the month is out, I would have to continue checking and putting oil in the car because it would be completely dry. No leaks ever detected... I've change the oil to full  synthetic  and still have the problem. The vehicle continuously losses power when driving uphill, My check engine light stays on and the light in the glove compartment does not go off while driving. I'm worried my engine will blow up if the problem persist. I am the original and only owner of this vehicle. There is also a problem with the suspension or axel, when I push hard on the brakes, the car makes a noise like the bottom fell out and is dragging metal on the floor. Mechanic also cannot figure that out, I've paid over  6k in diagnosis, repairs and time trying to get help and nothing. I would like to get my honda checked and fixed. I Anxiously await a response and solution to this car. I have Covid and this is my only source of transportation.",

(IT WAS A CALIFORNIA CAR WITH EXTRA SMOG COMPONENTS) NO TRANSMISSIONS ISSUES!! I REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER 2005 ACCORD 4CYL AT 79.441 MILES IN FEB OF 2018. THE CAR HAD BEEN VERY WELL MAINTAINED BY A HONDA DEALERSHIP IN GA. NOTHING WAS MISSED.  I ALSO HAD TRANSMISSION SERVICED AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS DONE BY A CERTIFIED HONDA MECHANIC BEFORE I EVEN PUT THE PLATE ON IT BACK IN NC. ON 6/12/19( 93500 ON CAR) I WAS IN A ROLLOVER WRECK IN MY 2002 TUNDRA.(GREAT TRUCK) AND REALLY NEEDED MY CAR. ON 6/14/19 I GO TO SEE MY TUNDRA IN THE JUNK YARD AND MY CAR JUST  STARTS  REVVING UP BUT STOPS MOVING. I PULLED OVER AND STOPPED THEN TRIED TO PUT CAR BACK INTO GEAR AND WAS ABLE TO GET  IT INTO 2ND GEAR AND LIMP TO A FRIENDS HOUSE. I WAS HEARTBROKEN!! TO LOSE BOTH IN 2 DAYS WAS INSANE!  I TOOK IT TO FRIENDLYS TRANSMISSION IN HIGH POINT NC AND THEY PUT IN A REBUILT TRANSMISSION VERY QUICKLY!!!!  I HOPE THIS ONE HOLDS BECAUSE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CAR WITH A GREAT ENGINE AND I WOULD LIKE TO DRIVE IT A LONG TIME. I THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO DEAL WITH HONDA BUT I WAS IN PAIN AND NEEDED MY CAR...IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT A LOW MILEAGE CAR THAT HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF SHOULD NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION SO SOON!!!  IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF 11V395000, RECALL R89, 8/27 2011 WOULD SOMEHOW APPLY TO MY CAR!!!",

AFTER I ENTERED THE PARKING AREA, AS I WAS ABOUT TO PARK, THE CAR ABRUPTLY SPED UP, CRASHED INTO THE BUILDING AHEAD OF ME, AND THE DRIVER'S AIRBAG WAS DEPLOYED.  THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND THE BUILDING WALL WERE DAMAGED (PHOTOS ARE ENCLOSED).  ALL THIS HAPPENED SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY.  SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE BUILDING RUSHED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED.  I WAS VISIBLY SHAKEN AND QUITE FRIGHTENED BY THIS ACCIDENT. THE BUSINESS OFFICE STAFF TOOK PHOTOS OF THE DAMAGED WALL AND THE VEHICLE.  MY TWO THUMBS WERE ACHING WITH MINOR BURN, BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO OTHER OBVIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY TO US, WE DECLINED THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE.  STATE POLICE TROOPER CAME, TOOK SOME INFORMATION BUT SAID THAT BECAUSE THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED IN A PRIVATE PROPERTY IT WILL NOT BE REPORTED.   I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THIS ACCIDENT COULD EVER HAPPEN.  I GOOGLED AND FOUND CASES IN WHICH UNINTENDED SUDDEN ACCELERATION HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  HASN'T THIS SAFETY ISSUE BEEN ADDRESSED?

CONVENIENT TO MASK BATTERY PROBLEMS WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE WHICH SERVES THE PURPOSE TO PRETTY MUCH  JUST DELAY AND SUPPRESS THE ISSUE  UNTIL THE 10 YR/100,000M WARRANTY IS OVER. IT IS KNOWN TO MAKE MILEAGE FAR WORSE BUT HEY-DRAWS OUT BEING ABLE TO PROVE ITS THE BATTERY! WORKS FOR THEM-( HONDA) WHATS WORSE IS WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE JUNK MODEL FOR OVER THE KBB VALUE, HAVE PAID IN FULL  AND ONLY BOUGHT 2YRS AGO- SO THAT NOW YOU NEED A CAR ALL OVER AGAIN AND CANT SELL THIS WHEN IT GETS POOR GAS MILEAGE AND NEEDS 4000 IN REPAIRS. HONDA SHOULD FOCUS ON US BEFORE THEIR ADVERTISING RANDOM FINANCIAL GIFTS OF AWARDS TO ANYONE! TRY GIVING IT BACK TO THOSE WHO GAVE YOU THAT MONEY FIRST...",

MY CAR'S MAKE/MODEL USES THE GPS NAVIGATION PANEL TO MANUALLY CHANGE INTERNAL FUNCTIONS, ACCESS THE TRIP COMPUTER, ENTER ADDRESSES, ET CETERA. WITHOUT USE OF THE NAVIGATION PANEL, I HAVE SEVERELY LIMITED ACCESS TO MOST OF MY CAR'S ELECTRONIC FUNCTIONS. THE NAVIGATION GETS STUCK ON THE START-UP SCREEN (SOMETHING THAT LOOKS BLUE/BLACK WITH WORDS 'HONDA'), AND NEVER GETS TO THE SECOND WARNING SCREEN (ORANGE TEXT ON BLACK), WHERE ONE CAN PUSH 'OK ON THE TOUCH SCREEN. WHEN THE WEATHER IS WARMER, SOMETIMES I CAN PUSH THIS OK BUTTON TO GET INTO THE CONTROLS. I USUALLY HAVE 30 SECONDS UNTIL IT FAILS AGAIN.    THE FOLLOWING ISSUES ARE PRESENT: 1) CDS; I CANNOT SELECT A CD TO LISTEN TO. I CAN EJECT/PUT CDS IN, BUT I CAN ONLY CHANGE SONGS USING THE CONTROLS ON MY STEERING WHEEL. 2) CLIMATE CONTROL/TEMPERATURE CONTROL: I CANNOT SWITCH FROM THE A/C TO HEAT. I CAN ONLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE UP/DOWN, RECIRCULATE AIR, OR TURN ON FRONT/REAR DEFROST. FOR ANY TEMPERATURE SETTING, WHEN I PUSH THE 'OFF' BUTTON, I CANNOT TURN THE SAME SETTING BACK ON WITH THE 'AUTO' BUTTON. IF I PUSH THE 'AUTO' BUTTON, IT RECALLS SOME RANDOM LAST TEMPERATURE SETTINGS, USUALLY A VERY COLD A/C SETTING (WHICH I NEVER PROGRAMMED OR DESIRED). 3) MAPS; I CAN'T ENTER ANY ADDRESSES, THEREFORE, THE NAVIGATION IS USELESS. IF IT MAGICALLY WORKS, IT TURNS OFF SHORTLY AFTER AN ADDRESS IS ENTERED.     THE NAVI 'LOCK-UP' SITUATION I DESCRIBED HERE HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR OVER A YEAR OR SO. WEATHER DOES AFFECT IT. MY RESEARCH CONCLUDES THAT MANY OTHER HONDA OWNERS HAD THIS ISSUE. MANY WERE TOLD BY HONDA DIRECTLY THAT HONDA DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS, AND TO CONTACT ALPINE, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE GPS NAVI. MOST CUSTOMERS WHO DID THIS WERE TOLD TO SEND THEIR WHOLE CD/DVD READER UNIT TO ALPINE FOR REPAIR, WHICH COSTS SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS.  *TR",

THE BRAKES WILL LOSE THE VACUUM BOOST IN THE INITIAL 2-3 PUMPS AND THEN AFTER A FEW MORE PUMPS WILL GET THE NORMAL VACUUM ASSIST BACK.     I HAVE GONE TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP AND ASKED THEM IF THERE ARE ANY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUE AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE NONE. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE HONDA INTEGRATED MOTOR ASSIST IN THEIR HYBRID VEHICLES, THERE IS AN EXTRA VACUUM SWITCH MODULE THAT CONTROLS THE BRAKE BOOSTER SO THAT IT CAN TURN THE ENGINE BACK ON DURING IDLE-STOP TO RESTORE BRAKE BOOSTING.

ONLY OCCASIONALLY DID THE CYLINDER REQUIRE SOME MINIMAL, ADDITIONAL BRAKE FLUID--AKIN TO A NORMAL MAINTENANCE AMOUNT.  KEEPING MY FLUID TO A MAXIMUM-LEVEL HAS NOT RESOLVED THE PROBLEM.    THIS PAST MARCH (2015), I REQUESTED MY WELL-RATED, INDEPENDENT MECHANIC TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. HE FIRST IDENTIFIED THE SAME 3 EARLIER HONDA SERVICE BULLETINS THAT I HAD (GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2007) THAT ADDRESSED THIS BRAKE PROBLEM, WHEREIN HONDA WAS MOSTLY IMPLICATING A FAULTY ABS (CONTROL) MODULE AS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM (NOTE: I'VE NEVER RECEIVED A SAFETY RECALL SVC. BULLETIN FROM HONDA FOR THIS PROBLEM). MY MECHANIC ESTIMATED THAT REPLACING MY ABS MODULE WOULD COST OVER $2000, BUT THAT EVEN THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GUARANTEE THAT MY PROBLEM WOULD BE RESOLVED.  SO, UNTIL I COULD DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE, I HAD HIM DO A FRONT BRAKE JOB TO \"BUY\" WHATEVER EXTRA STOPPING-POWER I COULD ... WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE MINIMAL-TO-NONE!  NOT ONLY DOES MY PROBLEM REMAIN, BUT IT IS GETTING RAPIDLY WORSE ...

ENTERED THE PASSENGER DOOR AND TRIED TO UNLOCK DOOR MANUALLY BY PULLING UP DOOR LOCK - WOULD NOT BUDGE. AFTER I CRAWLED ACROSS THE CENTER CONSOLE I GIGGLED DOOR A FEW TIMES AND WAS ABLE TO PULL UP DOOR LOCK. DROVE HOME AND TRIED OPENING DOOR WITH KEY AND IT WORKED FINE. TODAY, 6/22/15 WHEN I RETURNED HOME FROM THE STORE I PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND LOCKED THE DOOR. WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD LOCKED IT I TRIED TO UNLOCK IT WITH THE KEY. AGAIN, THE KEY WOULD GO IN, BUT IT WOULD NOT TURN TO UNLOCK THE DOOR. CALLED HONDA DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE ACTUATOR. I KNOW HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE MY CAR SERVICED FOR THIS PROBLEM.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AFTER GOING ON LINE THAT THIS IS A LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT HONDA HAS BEEN AWARE OF, BUT OBVIOUSLY WAS UNWILLING TO RECALL AND FIX.

ON 21ST SEPTEMBER 2014 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FAILED WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON FREEWAY TODAY.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER TURNED ON .THE CAR JUST STOPPED ON A CROWDED INTERSTATE, WHICH WAS VERY FRIGHTENING. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND I'VE NEVER MISSED AN OIL CHANGE, TIMING BELT, ETC. I'VE NEVER HAD ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR, NO LEAKS, NO ENGINE ISSUES AND THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THERE IS SOME SORT OF DEFECT WITH THIS AUTOMOBILE WHICH NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. MY SITUATION WITH THE TRANSMISSION IS OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND HONDA NEEDS TO STEP-UP TO THE PLATE. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS SAME PROBLEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH HONDA'S ESPECIALLY WITH 2005 ACCORD V6 TRANSMISSION FAILURES.   ON FURTHER RESEARCH ON NHTSA WEBSITE, I FOUND NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER : 11V395000 ADDRESSING SIMILAR PROBLEM AND AS OF 23RD SEPTEMBER 2014,  1.5 MILLION (1512107) VEHICLES HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR SIMILAR ISSUE.THE HONDA RECALL NUMBER IS R89  AND THE RECALL WAS PLACED ON AUGUST 27TH 2011, FOR HONDA ACCORDS 2005-2010 FOR THE TRANSMISSION. I TOOK MY CAR TO, GROSSINGER HONDA, MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD COMPLETELY FAILED ALTHOUGH FLUID LEVELS WERE NORMAL. DTC CODES  WERE P0741, P0746, AND P0777.  HONDA OPENED A CASE AND GAVE ME A CASE NO:N012014-09-22-02450.  MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION VEHICLES ARE AFFECTED FROM THIS RECALL AND THEY TELL ME MY CAR ISN'T ONE? I STRONGLY FEEL THAT MY CASE IS GENUINE AND WITH REFERENCE TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER : 11V395000, MY VEHICLE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS RECALL BY AMERICAN HONDA .  *TR",

        "summary": "MY 2005 ACCORD HAD AN ILLUMINATED SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) LIGHT.  THE HONDA DEALER DIAGNOSED IT DOWN TO A BROKEN DRIVER SEAT SENSOR HARNESS; FAULT CODES 71-10 (DRIVERS SEAT POS SENSOR) AND A2-10 (FAULTY PWR SUPPLY).  THIS CONDITION IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS DESCRIBED IN HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 07-002, \"SAFETY RECALL: DRIVER'S SEAT POSITION SENSOR HARNESS REPLACEMENT.\"  JUST AS DESCRIBED IN THE BULLETIN, THE WIRES ON THE HARNESS BECOME DAMAGED AND IN FACT WERE COMPLETELY BROKEN AWAY FROM THE PLUG END.  HOWEVER, MY VIN FALLS OUTSIDE THE AFFECTED VIN'S LISTED IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER THIS ACTION.  FURTHERMORE, I FEEL THE DEALER CHARGED MORE THAN NECESSARY FOR THE REPAIR: THEY CHARGED 1.96 HRS OF LABOR (AT $97.00/HR), OR $190.00, AND $15.20 FOR THE PART TOTALING $205.20.  IN COMPARISON, THE SERVICE BULLETIN CALLS FOR 0.6 HRS OF LABOR, WHICH WHEN ADDED TO THE PART COST WOULD HAVE TOTALED $73.40. BOTTOM LINE:  HONDA DID NOT PROVIDE THE PROPER FIX FOR DAMAGED DRIVER'S SEAT POSITION HARNESS'S IN LATER PRODUCTION VINS.  SINCE THEY CONTINUE TO CAUSE THE SAME UNSAFE CONDITION, HONDA MUST BE COMPELLED TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS RECALL. *TR",

THE HARDER I PRESSED, THE HARDER THE ACCELERATION BECAME. I BECAME VERY CONCERNED AND SCARED THAT THE CAR MIGHT ACCELERATE SUDDENLY AND MAY CAUSE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. I QUICKLY MOVE THE GEAR HAND PEDAL SHIFTERS FOWARD TO (P)ARK. THE CAR JERKED FORWARD A BIT AND THEN STOOD STILL; HOWEVER, THE ENGINE STARTED REVVING WITH A LOUD DIN AND THEN BACK TO NORMAL.I STARTED TO SLOWLY MOVE  THE GEAR BACK INTO (D)RIVE MODE. THE CAR BEHAVED NORMALLY AND I PARKED MY CAR IN A AVAILABLE PARKING SLOT.     PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, I HAD A MINOR INCIDENT SIMILAR TO THIS. THIS WAS A ABOUT 2 WEEKS BACK. I WAS SLOWED AND STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN TO MAPLE. WHILE IN STOP MODE PRESSING THE BRAKE, THE CAR STARTED JERKING AND ACCELERATING FORWARD SLOWLY. I QUICKLY PRESSED THE BRAKE HARDER AND IT JERKED FORWARD AND STOPPED. AT THAT POINT, I JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF, THINKING THAT WAS UNUSUAL BUT WASN'T REALLY BAD TO TAKE ISSUE.     ALL THIS HAPPENED WHEN I CHANGED MY ACCORD HYBRID BATTERY AND A HYBRID CONTROLLER OVER A MONTH BACK WHEN I HAD A HYBRID BATTERY AND THE CONTROLLER THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACE ON ACCOUNT OF A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE CAR. THE CAR FELT OK AFTER THE CHANGE. HOWEVER, I HAD THE CAR SINCE 2005 AND NEVER DID I ENCOUNTER A SUDDEN ACCELERATION ON THIS CAR, NOT ONCE UNTIL AFTER THE BATTERY AND CONTROLLER CHANGE.

CLEARLY THERE IS A MALFUNCTION IN THIS PART/SENSOR. WHEN IS HONDA GOING TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFE AND DO THE RIGHT THING!!!  I WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPEN AND IT WAS NOT CAUSE  BY SOMETHING HITTING UNDERNEATH MY VEHICLE.  *TR",

OUR CAR IS 74,000 MILES WE TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC AT HONDA DEALERSHIP AND HE SAID THE TRANSMISSION IS FAILING A WAY HE NEVER SEEN BEFORE HE CHECKED AND THERE ARE NO RECALLS FOR THAT PROBLEM SO TO WE NEED TO GET A NEW TRANSMISSION AND REPLACE  THE AXLES AS WELL WHICH IS GOING TO COST US AROUND 4000 DOLLARS I DON'T THINK THIS IS FAIR I BELIEVE IN MY HEARTH IT'S A MANUFACTURE PROBLEM AND IT SHOULD BE  A RECALL  I DID A LOT RESEARCHES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. PLEASE DO YOUR INVESTIGATION WE CAN NOT AFFORD TO FIX THE CAR WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG TO THIS CAR BUT DRIVING IT TO WORK AND KEEP IT MAINTENANCE TILL IT START TO ACT UP WE ARE LEASING A CAR NOW TO GO TO WORK  TO PRODUCT PLEASE HELP US. *TR",

I TOOK THE CAR TO A MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME THAT A ROCK HAD HIT AND DAMAGED THE AC CONDENSER, CAUSING THE FREON GAS TO LEAK FROM THE CONDENSER. HE SAID THAT THE CONDENSER IS LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE RADIATOR AND BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION IS WILL ALWAYS BE EXPOSED TO DEBRIS WHILE DRIVING.

HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE CONDENSER, THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE PART WILL BE DAMAGED AGAIN AND AGAIN.

I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THIS PROBLEM AT 5,000 & 15,000 MI.  HONDA MECHANICS COULD FIND NO PROBLEM.  AT 34,712 MI. A MECHANIC FINALLY VERIFIED THE PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE TRANS FLUID PER TECH LINE WITH PART #08798-9031. THIS WAS IN APRIL 07.  THE PROBLEM PERSISTED.  IN AUGUST 07 WITH  44,000 MI. I TOOK IT IN AGAIN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  NO HELP.  FINALLY I WAS CONTACTED BY A SERVICE MANAGER WHO VERIFIED THAT HONDA HAD A PROBLEM WITH 3RD GEAR IN THE ACCORD AND A FIX WAS ON THE WAY.  IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN DECEMBER.  IT IS NOW LATE MARCH AND STILL NO FIX.  SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE GONE ON-LINE AND FOUND THAT HONDA HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 6 SPEED TRANSMISSION IN THE ACCORD, THE CIVIC AND THE ACURA SINCE AT LEAST 2005.  THERE ARE MANY SITES WITH HONDA OWNERS COMPLAINING OF THIS PROBLEM AND GETTING NO RESPONSE FROM HONDA.  IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, SUCH AS MERGING INTO TRAFFIC FROM A FREEWAY ON-RAMP, IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE THE CAR EITHER NOT GO INTO 3RD GEAR OR POP OUT OF IT.  THE VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY DECELERATES AND OTHER VEHICLES TRAVELING AT FREEWAY SPEEDS COME UP VERY FAST.  IS THERE ANY WAY TO MAKE HONDA FIX THESE CARS?  BELOW IS AN EXCERPT FROM EDMUNDS.COM AND ALSO A SERVICE BULLETIN RELATED TO THIS ON-GOING PROBLEM.    A FEW OF OUR EDITORS HAVE NOTICED IN THE PAST THAT THE TRANSMISSION SHIFT LEVER IN OUR LONG-TERM 2006 HONDA CIVIC SI WILL OCCASIONALLY POP OUT OF GEAR OR GRIND WHEN MAKING A 2-TO-3 UPSHIFT. THIS TRAIT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ENDEMIC TO OUR CAR AS OTHER CIVIC SI OWNERS HAVE MADE FORUM POSTS ABOUT THIS TOPIC. (OTHER SIX-SPEED MANUAL ACURA VEHICLES MIGHT ALSO SUFFER FROM THIS PROBLEM.)

THE SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER HAD FRIED SINCE THE SEAT BELT WAS LOCKED AND WAS NOT RETRACTING IN ADDITION, THE SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER HAD FRIES.  I HAD CONTACTED HONDA NORTH AMERICA, AND THEY REPORTED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND THE VEHICLE BEHAVED AS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO. HOWEVER, AFTER CONTACTING NHTSA, THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED WITH A 2005 HONDA ACCORD, IF THE SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONER FIRES, THE AIRBAG SHOULD FIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY, WHO THEN SUGGESTED ME TO SUBMIT A CLAIM TO NHTSA. THE VEHICLE DID UNDERGO REPAIR AUTHORIZED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE SEAT BELT WAS REPLACED IN ADDITION TO THE AIRBAG MODULE AND OTHER ASSOCIATED ITEMS. HOWEVER, THE OLD ITEMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  *JB",

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RAN A COMPUTER TEST ON THE CAR AND CONFIRMED THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG WAS NOT RECEIVING A SIGNAL, AND IN FACT WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH.  IN SHORT, THE AIRBAG WAS NON-FUNCTIONAL.      THE DEALER HAD THE CAR UNTIL TODAY, 8/24/2005.  THEIR FIX WAS TO \"CLEAR THE CODE\" AND MAKE THE LIGHT GO OFF.  THEY CLAIM THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, AND WANTED TO RETURN THE CAR TO US.     NO PARTS WERE REPLACED.  THE LIGHT SIMPLY TURNED OFF AND THEY CONSIDER THAT \"FIXED\" I SUPPOSE.   I INSISTED ON AN EXPLANATION, SINCE THIS IS A CRITICAL SAFETY ITEM.

IT MAY EVEN CAUSE SOME UNFORESEEN TRANSMISSION BEHAVIOR AFFECTING DRIVABILITY.HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CONTACTED AND THEIR SUGGESTION WAS TO BE \"MORE CAREFUL\" IN SELECTING THE GEAR SHIFTER POSITION.  THAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL SOLUTION TO AN OBVIOUS MECHANICAL PROBLEM (SHORT COMING). *AK",
