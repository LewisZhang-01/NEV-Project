AS THE VEHICLE HAS A FACTORY 70K POWERTRAIN WARRANTY I BROUGHT IT TO MY LOCAL ACURA DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NORMAL AND ACCEPTABLE UNDER ACURA GUIDE LINES. I EXPLAINED IN MY 38  YEARS OF DRIVING MANY VEHICLES MOST OF THEM NEW THAT I HAD NEVER OWNED ANYTHING THAT BURNED OIL UNTIL I PURCHASED AN ACURA WHICH IS COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO WHY PEOPLE PURCHASE EXPENSIVE HIGH END VEHICLES FROM REPUTABLE CAR COMPANIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE CURRENTLY MONITORING THE CONSUMPTION NOW BUT I HOLD OUT LITTLE HOPE AS I HAVE READ ON DIFFERENT ACURA MDX FORUMS THAT ACURA IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT THIS. I DID READ WHERE HONDA WAS FORCED TO RECALL 1.6 MILLION 3.5L ENGINES FOR THIS VERY ISSUE AND ONLY OFFERED TO EXTEND THE FACTORY WARRANTIES AS A RESULT. THESE ENGINES ARE OF THE SAME BASIC DESIGN SAVE FOR THE ACURA 3.7L HAS NO CAST IRON SLEEVES HENCE THE LARGER DISPLACEMENT. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL CAUSE A PREMATURE FAILURE OF MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND SPARK PLUGS. I HAD BELIEVED THAT EMISSION REQUIREMENTS WERE TO STRICT TODAY TO ALLOW FOR ANY OIL CONSUMPTION (BURNING) UNDER THE EPA'S STRICT GUIDE LINES. I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT THIS WOULD EVEN BE AN ISSUE IN SUCH A MARQUIS BRAND SUCH AS ACURA. SINCE HONDA WOULD FAR OUTSELL THE ACURA BRAND THERE WERE NO DOUBT FAR MORE COMPLAINTS FOR THE 3.5L ENGINE THEN THE SMALLER SELLING 3.7L ENGINE OF SIMILAR ARCHITECTURE. I HOPE THAT MORE CONSUMERS WITH THE SAME PREDICAMENT WILL COME FORWARD TO PROVE THAT THE SAME ISSUE EXISTS WITH THE SIMMILIAR ACURA ENGINE.
