        "summary": "After approximately 2 unbroken hours of driving North on I-35 from Minneapolis on January 24th, 2022, I exited the freeway at exit 214 near Moose Lake.  I came to a stop at the top of the ramp (stop sign) to allow cross traffic to clear and then proceeded to accelerate while turning left to cross the bridge over the freeway.  About halfway through the turn, a blinking check-engine light came on.  The engine also began running noticeably rougher and would not accelerate beyond 30-40 mph.  I proceeded to drive about a 1/4 mile in this state to the nearest parking lot - a McDonalds just beyond the bridge.  Once parked, I turned the car off and looked up check-engine codes in the owner's manual.  The manual indicated that a cylinder misfire was detected and that I should seek dealer service.  Frustrated (the nearest Honda dealer was likely in Duluth, an hour away), I tried starting the car and was surprised to find that it started normally without any check-engine light.  After some lunch, I got back on the freeway and proceeded to drive another several hours without incident to my final destination near Virginia, MN. I quickly chalked it up to the unusually cold weather that morning, even for MN in January, and, since the issue has never repeated itself, I did not consult a dealer.  However, I've recently read of many other Ridgeline owners experiencing very similar issues and thought it would be best for me to contribute my account. Under the right conditions, I believe this could be a very serious safety concern that deserves rigorous attention by Honda's engineers.",

After stopping (engine idle was on but don't think engaged) and no oncoming traffic, I turned left. Immediately as I pressed the gas pedal, truck started to sputter and engine light started flashing. Luckily no traffic coming up from behind and I had room to pull over and stop. However, since this is the SECOND time this has happened, I had my wife video the dashboard. Yep got it all on video. This has to be FIXED. Can't imagine if that were my kids driving and traffic was barreling up on them. Imagine a semi coming up at 60mph and no power or place to move out of the way.

(THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES ALREADY)  (DEC 7, 2021) Hello all, I have a 2021 RTL-E. After driving on highway for an hour and a half at 80mph, I exited the highway and as soon as I pulled onto a secondary road the check engine light started flashing and the engine was hesitating with little to no power and poor shifting. I limped it to safe place to pull over (aprox 3 miles) and shut the truck off.  I checked under the hood and didn't see anything and after approximately two minutes I restarted the truck and the light was gone and it drove fine after that. (It was 15\u00b0F with 10,250 miles at the time and not towing or hauling anything) I drove it the next day 4 hours on Highway without any issues.  Has anybody else experienced this issue on the 2021's?  There's not enough room to type the other times this problem occurred!!!  This is an unsafe vehicle to drive and can cause injury or DEATH.  The 2021 Honda Ridgeline is no longer the dependable vehicle that I was hoping to have when I purchased it NEW in June of 2021.  I live in a rural area and do not have a dealer that is close by which is why I bought a Honda in the first place because it was Supposed to be a dependable vehicle.

This tool is currently not available to purchase from any Honda dealer. This tool has to be used with the front hood open and reaching down and turning a bolt & manually locking the transmission in Neutral. The location of this bolt outside the truck & under the hood is also a hazard for the vehicle rolling and not being able to easily disengage it from neutral by having to get back out of the truck again and get under the hood. It is also a hazard to have to get out of the vehicle, on a highway or busy intersection or other hazardous area. In prior models of this vehicle, there was a method to manually put the vehicle in neutral while seated in the drivers seat, minimizing the risk of injury by having to get out of the truck and pop the hood. This is a very hazardous design flaw that should be remedied by Honda immediately. Honda should provide remedy to all vehicle owners and provide the method for manually putting the vehicle in neutral back inside the vehicle as it was in prior models as it is a safety hazard as it is designed now with the manual release under the front hood.",
