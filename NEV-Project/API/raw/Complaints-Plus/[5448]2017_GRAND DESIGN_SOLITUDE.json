WE PURCHASED THE UNIT IN FEBRUARY OF 2017 FROM LAZY DAYS RV IN TUCSON, AZ.     WHEN WE ARRIVED IN UTAH WE FOUND THAT WE A BROKEN LEAF SPRING ON DRIVERS SIDE REAR AXEL AND THAT THE TIRE HAD BEEN DAMAGED. WE HAD THOSE REPLACED AT LES SCHWAB TIRES IN PROVO, UTAH AT OUR EXPENSE. THIS OCCURRED ON JUNE 14, 2017. I THEN CONTACTED THE FACTORY AND SPOKE WITH [XXX]. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE PROBLEMS AND HE SAID THAT GRAND DESIGN WOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR REASONABLE COSTS.    THE FOLLOWING DAY WE LEFT UTAH AND WENT CALDWELL, ID. AFTER ARRIVING THERE WE FOUND THAT THE OTHER THREE LEAF SPRINGS HAD COLLAPSED. I CONTACTED THE FACTORY AGAIN AND SPOKE TO [XXX] WHO SAID THAT HE COULD UNDERSTAND HAVING ONE BAD SPRING BUT TO HAVE ALL FOUR GO BAD WAS UNLIKELY AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE IT WEIGHED. I AGREED. IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD THE WORK DONE AGAIN AT MY EXPENSE AND I THEN PARKED THE UNIT UNTIL WE COULD GET IT BACK TO THE DEALER FOR OTHER WORK. ONCE THERE WE FOUND THAT YET ANOTHER SPRING HAD COLLAPSED. I HAD THE DEALER WEIGH THE UNIT AND IT WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN THE PUBLISHED WEIGHTS FOR THIS UNIT. AS OF THIS WRITING THE DEALER SAYS THAT THEY ARE STILL WAITING  ON A RESPONSE FROM GRAND DESIGN.    SO IN CLOSING WHILE WE AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE, I CAN'T HELP BUT TO CONSIDER THE BIGGER PICTURE AND THAT IS, ARE THESE AXEL/SPRINGS UNDERSIZED FOR THIS SIZE RV AND IS IT SAFE TO DRIVE THE HIGHWAYS?
