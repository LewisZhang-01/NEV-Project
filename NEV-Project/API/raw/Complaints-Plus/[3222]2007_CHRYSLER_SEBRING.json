I ASKED THEM WHAT DID THEY FIND OUT ABOUT MY VEHICLE AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF THEM WORKING ON IT AND THEY STATED THEY WHERE UNSURE STILL WORKING ON IT. THEY GAVE ME A CALL BACK A FEW DAYS LATER AND THEY STATED THAT THE ISSUE IS THE TIPM AND THAT THEY GOT THAT INFO FROM CHRYSLER BECAUSE THEY EVENTUALLY HAD TO CONTACT THEM TO SEE IF THEY KNEW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND THAT THEY TOLD THEM THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE IN CHRYSLER VEHICLES MADE FROM 2007 TO 2014.

THE VEHICLE WILL GO INTO LIMP MODE WHEN THE ETC LIGHT IS SOLID AND WON'T GO MORE THAN 10-15MPH. THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND MECHANIC FOUND NO CODES TO TELL WHAT WAS WRONG. I HAVE BEEN ON THE FREEWAY OR CITY STREETS WHEN IT WILL RANDOMLY GO INTO LIMP MODE AND HAVE TO SAFELY MANEUVER AWAY FROM TRAFFIC AS VEHICLE SLOWS WITH NO RESPONSE FROM THE GAS PEDDLE. I HAVE READ ONLINE THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAFETY PROBLEM AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT OR FIND THE SOURCE. I OBSERVED MANY OTHERS SPENDING HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF DOLLARS ON DIFFERENT SPECULATED PARTS THAT \"MAY\" CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN.

MANY OF THE COMPLAINANTS ON LINE WERE INDIVIDUALS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AS I AM AND HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR INJURY OR DEATH. LOCAL DEALERS HAD ISSUES RESOLVING THE PROBLEM.    MY SECOND ISSUE WHICH IS ALSO A COMMON ISSUE FOR CHRYSLER OWNERS IS THAT THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER LIGHTS GO OUT AND CEASE TO WORK AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ANY OF YOUR INSTRUMENTS AT NIGHT SUCH AS YOUR SPEED, TACHOMETER, GAS GAUGE,ENGINE TEMPERATURE ECT. THIS IS A BIG SAFETY CONCERN AS YOU CAN NOT SEE YOUR SPEED AT NIGHT OR EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND REDUCED SPEEDS ARE IN AFFECT, AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO KNOW IF YOUR RUNNING OUT OF GAS OR CAR IS OVERHEATING CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE. I DID ALTHOUGH FIND A RECALL FOR DIFFERENT MODELS WITH GAS GAUGE ISSUES AS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR RUNNING OUT OF GAS. THIS INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ISSUE HAS TO BE FAR WORSE THAN THE GAS GAUGE RECALL AS IT CAUSES THE SAME CONCERNS PLUS SEVERAL MORE IN JUST ONE PROBLEM.

RECOMMENDED TO REPLACE SEAT ADJUSTER AND WIRING. THESE ARE THE WORDS USED BY THE MECHANIC AS TO WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED WITH A REQUEST TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AT THEIR COST, AND THAT WAS DENIED. I HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH CHRYSLER CONCERNING THIS MATTER AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING, THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM REPAIRED. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE PROBLEM HAS COME AND GONE. NOW THE PROBLEM HAS COME BACK UP AGAIN. I AM IN FEAR OF THE AIR BAG GOING OFF ON ITS OWN OR NOT OPERATING PROPERLY IF INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. I AM TIRED OF PURSUING THIS MATTER WITH CHRYSLER AND FINALLY JUST GAVE UP.  AFTER TALKING TO A MECHANIC FRIEND OF MINE HE TOLD ME TO CONTACT YOUR AGENCY TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET ME SOME SORT OF SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. RIGHT NOW I AM HAVING THE AIR BAG LIGHT PROBLEM DAILY AND AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY AND OTHERS THAT MAY BE  IN  MY CAR WITH ME.

EMERGENCY BREAK LIGHT INTERMITTENTLY ILLUMINATES WHILE DRIVING - EMERG BREAK IS OFF AND NEW BREAKS INSTALLED ISSUE STILL UNRESOLVED. DELAYED AUTO OFF HEADLIGHTS DID NOT SHUT OFF. RETURNED TO VEHICLE 2 HOURS LATER WITH DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS STILL ON AND SINCE THEY ARE AUTOMATIC THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF. AFTER CYCLING THE ENGINE THEY SHUT OFF, BUT NOW FAIL TO COME ON AT ALL. IN THE BASE MODEL THERE IS NO FEATURE TO TURN THEM \"ON\" OR \"OFF\" - ISSUE UNRESOLVED. THE VEHICLE ALSO REFUSES TO CHANGE THE SETTING TO TURN THE \"AUTO UNLOCK\" FEATURE \"ON\" WHEN VEHICLE IS PUT IN PARK. THIS FEATURE ALSO REFUSES TO WORK ON \"FIRST UNLOCK\" ON THE KEY FOB. THE DOORS JUST CONTINUE TO STAY LOCKED - ISSUE UNRESOLVED. I HOPE MINE DOES NOT START SHUTTING OFF ON ME LIKE SO MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS. *TR",

STARTING IN SEP 2010 IT STARTED HAVING ISSUES, (I.E., ENGINE SHUT OFF AT LOW SPEED OR WHEN GAS TANK WAS AT 1/4 TANK, ENGINE WOULD ACT AS IF WAS GOING TO STALL WHEN SITTING AT A STOP SIGN/LIGHT THEN WOULD LURCH FORWARD SUDDENLY, AND BRAKE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON).  I HAD THE O2 SENSORS REPLACED, ENGINE LIGHT WENT OUT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND CAME BACK ON. MECHANIC THEN CHANGED WIRING HARNESS. THIS TIME LIGHT WAS OUT FOR ABOUT A MONTH OR 2 BUT NOW WILL NOT TURN OFF EVEN THOUGH THE MECHANIC COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH EITHER THE SENSORS OR THE WIRING HARNESS. NOW THEY SUGGEST REPLACING THE ENGINE BRAIN WHICH AT THIS TIME IS FINANCIALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME. I TOOK THE CAR TO A CHRYSLER DEALER SHOP WHEN THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAM ON AND I TOLD THE GUY ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES. HE PULLED UP THE HISTORY AND INFORMED ME THE CAR'S FORMER OWNER HAD SAME SHUT OFF ISSUES AT 16K MILES AND HAD A NEW ENGINE INSTALLED AT 20K MILES. CAR IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WITH NEW ENGINE BEING PUT IN.  I'VE ALSO HAD TO HAVE THE BRAKES REPLACED AFTER OWNING THE CAR LESS THAN A YEAR.  I'M AFRAID THE CAR SHUTTING OFF ON ME IS GOING TO GET ME KILLED AS I'VE JUST NEARLY MISSED GETTING INTO 2 ACCIDENTS WHEN THE ENGINE HAS SHUT OFF ON ME.  *TR",

WHY IN 2007 THE CONSUMER MAGAZINE WHO TESTED THE CARS  WROTE IT UP AS HAVING A BAD STEERING FEEL  THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH, AND THEY WERE EXPERT DRIVERS.  YOU CAN NOT CONTROL  THIS CAR UNDER SAFELY UNDER NORMAL TO LIGHT RAIN AND LIGHT SNOW DRIVING CONDITIONS.  YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN UNDER THE HIGHWAY DRIVING SPEED OF 45MPH,WHICH CAN GET YOU A TICKET, ON INTERSECTION SPEED OF 55-60 MPH.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER 40 YEARS WITH A VERY GOOD DRIVING RECORD.  I AM SURPRISED  THAT A CAR LIKE THIS WOULD BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC USING OLD OR OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY JUST FOR A PROFIT NO MATTER WHO GETS HURT.    WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT COME OUT OF PARK I WAS SENT A RECALL FROM CHRYSLER AND THEY FIXED NO FEE.  I HAVE HAD WIRING ISSUES BULBS BLOWING AND SPEEDOMETER LIGHTS OUT SO YOU CAN NOT SEE AT NIGHT.  TROUBLE WITH FUSES AND MODULES TO BE REPLACED.  I HAD TO AT LEAST NOTIFY  SOMEONE ON THIS WEBSITE .  I WASN'T AWARE OF THIS SITE AND I AM GLAD  THAT  YOU GUYS DO THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING.  *TR",

THE ABS LIGHT MAY COME ON THEN GO OFF AND (PERIODICALLY GOES ON AND OFF).  REGARDLESS OF THE LIGHT STATUS, THE ABS SYSTEM RANDOMLY ENGAGES AND DOES NOT ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO STOP IN A SAFE MANNER.  THE ABS WHEN ENGAGED RESISTS THE DRIVER FROM APPLY PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE RESULT IS THE CAR NOT STOPPING.  LUCKILY I WAS GOING SLOW AND THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND OTHER WISE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT. THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON, RESISTED MY BRAKING FORCE THEN WENT OFF AND ALLOW THE BRAKES TO ENGAGE AS ANTICIPATED. THE ROADS WERE NORMAL, DRY AND FREE OF DEBRIS/ LOOSE FILL.  THIS HAPPENED TWICE OVER TWO DAYS.  ON THE SECOND DAY I PARKED THE CAR AND LET IT SIT UNTIL IT'S SERVICE DATE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DIAGNOSED A FAULTY SENSOR WITH CODE C1044.  THEY SAID IT WAS DUE TO RUST.  FIRST THIS IS A 2007 CAR, SECOND IF RUST ON A SENSOR IS GOING TO INHIBIT NORMAL BRAKING THEN THE PART IS DEFECTIVE AND OR THE DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE.  I WAS LUCKY SOME ONE ELSE IS NOT GOING TO BE.  ABS IS DESIGNED TO PUMP THE BRAKES UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  I'M SURE NORMAL DRIVING AT 25 MPH ON A DRY NORMAL SURFACE ISN'T ONE OF THEM.  EVEN IF THE ABS FAILS THE OPERATOR SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO STOP THE CAR BY APPLYING MANUAL FORCE TO THE BRAKE PETAL.  THIS FAILURE DOES NOT ALLOW EFFECTIVE USE OF THE BRAKES!
