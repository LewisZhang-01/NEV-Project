AT THE TIME I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT THOUGHT I RAN OVER SOMETHING AND POPPED IT. REPLACED THE SAME DAY WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND AND WE WENT TO THE LAKE THE VERY NEXT DAY. AFTER RETUNING HOME MY WIFE NOTICED THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER TIRE WITH TREAD MISSING AND WIRES HANGING OUT BUT HAD NOT YET BLOWN. TOOK THAT TIRE AND THE REMAINING 2 ORIGINAL TIRES IN FOR INSPECTION ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY ALL WERE EGG SHAPED AND ABOUT READY TO FAIL AT ANY TIME. THESE TIRES WERE ONLY 3 YEARS OLD WITH LESS THE 2,000 MILES ON THEM. THE COMPANY WOULD ONLY WOULD NOT GIVE ME AN ENTIRE REFUND DUE TO THAT THEY WERE WORN BUT WITH ONLY 20% OR LESS TOTAL WEAR AND ALSO DIDN'T WANT THE TIRES BACK FOR TESTING. I FEEL THESE TIRES ARE DANGEROUS TO BE ON THE ROAD AND COULD HAVE NOT ONLY COST ME MY BOAT AND TRAILER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY MY FAMILY, MINE OR SOMEONE THEIR LIFE HAD THEY ALL GONE TOGETHER WHICH HONESTLY THEY COULD HAVE WITH TWO GOING DOWN WITHIN A DAY OF EACH OTHER AND THE OTHER TWO ON THE BRINK. THE TIRES ARE TRAILER KING TIRES ST RADIALS OF A HAUL-RITE PONTOON TRALER FROM B&M FG.CO.",
