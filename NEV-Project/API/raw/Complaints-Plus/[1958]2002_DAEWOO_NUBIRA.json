AS FAR AS I KNOW, THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT IT DID!!!  I HOPE THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS DAEWOO IS TRYING TO HIDE.  THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THE DAEWOO'S, PLEASE HAVE YOUR CAR CHECKED IMMEDIATELY BY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL FOR ANY KIND OF POTENTIAL FAILURE.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE ENGINE CAUGHT ON FIRE.  I WAS DRIVING WITH THE AC ON AND SUDDENLY I NOTICED SMOKE IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR.  THEN SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THE VENTS AND THEN I SAW FLAMES OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE.  I CHANGED MY OIL ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT EVERYDAY.  CAN'T BE THE COOLANT OR THE ENGINE OIL BECAUSE IT WAS DRIVING FINE FOR TWO WEEKS.  OWNERS OF DAEWOO, BEWARE!!! DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. GET YOUR CAR CHECKED-OUT ASAP FOR ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.  MAYBE THE DAEWOO ENGINE IS ONLY GOOD FOR 40000 MILES AND SINCE MINE'S CLOSE, IT JUST DIED ON ME.  I AM ONLY GLAD I WAS NOT HURT AND NO ONE ELSE WAS ON THE HIGHWAY. I MANAGED TO PULL OVER DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IN DALLAS AND I JUST WATCHED MY CAR BURN.
