THE FACTORY TRANSMISSION IS WARRANTIED FOR 60,000 MILES AND IN MY SPECIFIC CASE THE VEHICLE HAD 110,000 MILES.  THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ENGINEERING CHANGES TO PRECLUDE THIS BEARING FAILURE AND HAS A WARRANTY OF 100,000 MILES.  THE CHIEF CONCERN IS THAT FORD-LINCOLN IS WELL AWARE OF THE PENDING TRANSMISSION FAILURE SO MUCH THAT THEY ISSUED AN INTERNAL TSB ADDRESSING THE ISSUE, BUT NOT SO CONCERNED TO SEND ANY CORRESPONDENCE TO OWNERS OF VEHICLES CONTAINING THIS TRANSMISSION AND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SHOULD IT FAIL, WHICH APPARENTLY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC AND LIFE-THREATENING TO OCCUPANTS AND POTENTIALLY OTHER VEHICLES DRIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.  ALSO, IN SPEAKING TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ON THEIR NATIONAL CALL LINE FOR CONCERNS, THE AGENT WAS CERTAIN I DID NOT HAVE A TRANSMISSION SUBJECT TO FAILURE, EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS THE TSB IN EFFECT WHICH I MENTIONED ABOVE.  SHE INDICATED THAT DID NOT RELATE TO MY VEHICLE WHEN I QUESTIONED HER FURTHER.  BOTH FORD MECHANIC AND A CERTIFIED MECHANIC NOT ASSOCIATED WITH FORD BOTH INDICATED THE TRANSMISSION IN MY LINCOLN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TSB FOR TRANSMISSION FAILURE.

        "summary": "COPY OF EMAIL TO FORD MOTOR ON APRIL 16, 2014:   WE RECENTLY LEASED A 2014 LINCOLN MKZ. THE NEW PUSH BUTTON SHIFT CONTROL THAT WE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO, RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT WITH $1187 WORTH OF DAMAGES TO THE FRONT END. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND THE BUILDING/DRAIN PIPE WE HIT DID NOT SUSTAIN DAMAGE REQUIRING A POLICE REPORT OR INSURANCE CLAIM.  SUMMARY: CAR LEASED FROM STAR LINCOLN ON FEBRUARY 22ND. WHILE DRIVING TO FLORIDA ON MARCH 22ND WE STOPPED FOR GASOLINE/COFFEE. AFTER FILLING THE CAR I WENT INSIDE THE SERVICE STATION. MY WIFE SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED THE CAR FROM THE PUMP AREA TO THE PARKING AREA IN FRONT OF THE SERVICE STATION. SHE THEN STOPPED THE CAR WITH THE BRAKE AND THOUGHT THE CAR WAS THEN IN PARK. UPON TAKING HER FOOT OFF THE BRAKE, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD HITTING THE BUILDING CORNER AND KNOCKING DOWN THE DRAIN PIPE. FIVE MORE FEET OVER, SHE WOULD HAVE CRASHED INTO THE SERVICE STATION WINDOW SO WE CONSIDER OURSELVES LUCKY.  MY WIFE AND I ARE EXPERIENCED, LONG TIME DRIVERS AND FIND THE PUSH BUTTON SHIFT CONTROL INITIALLY CONFUSING. IN FACT WE ARE NOW BOTH SAYING ALOUD WHEN WE STOP TO PARK, PUSH PARK AND THEN OFF.    I DO PLAN ON REPORTING THIS INCIDENT TO NHSTA TO SIMPLY BE ON THE RECORD.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.    TO NHTSA- WE REALIZE THIS IS A MATTER OF DRIVER ERROR AND NOT SURE WHAT CAN BE DONE BY AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES TO HELP DRIVERS BE MORE ADEPT AT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY.  *TT",

INCIDENT2:  WHILE FILLING GAS TANK I WAS STANDING OVER THE HOSE, NOT HOLDING THE HANDLE.   I WAS WAITING TO  FILL UP THE VEHICLE.  I WITNESSED THE SPOUT POP OUT OF THE GAS TANK AND GASOLINE SPILLED ON MY SHIRT, PANTS AND SHOES.    I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE WITH ANY VEHICLE.  IT SEEMS IT NEEDS SOME SORT OR PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE SO THAT IT DOESN'T EJECT THE GASOLINE HOSE AND SPOUT SO VIOLENTLY.    THE IN INDENTS HAPPENED TWO WEEKS APART.   *TR",
