        "summary": "THERE IS A SEVERE SAFETY PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUDI 94S4, OTHER MODEL YEAR S CARS AND OTHER AUDI CARS WITH THE 100 BODY.  WHEN THE PLASTIC PART THAT CONNECTS THE THROTTLE BODY TO THE THROTTLE CABLE BREAKS, THE ENGINE GOES UP TO 7000 RPM (OVER RED LINE).  IF IN HEAVILY CONGESTED TRAFFIC AS I WAS, THE OWNER RISKS HIS LIFE OR HIS ENGINE.      SINCE I DECIDED MY LIFE AND THAT OF MY PASSENGERS WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ENGINE, I LET THE ENGINE RACE AND USED THE BRAKE TO CONTROL SPEED UNTIL I COULD SAFELY GET OFF THE BELTWAY AND ONTO A SIDE ROAD.  ONCE THERE, I SAW THAT MY EXHAUST MANIFOLD HAD GOTTEN CHERRY RED WITH AND COULD HAVE CAUSED A FIRE.      THESE CARS NEED IMMEDIATE RECALL AS A SAFETY MEASURE AND THE PART REPLACED WITH METAL.  FAILURE WAS WITHOUT WARNING, CAR''S SPEED BEGAN TO INCREASE WITHOUT WARNING AND THROTTLE PRESSURE HAD NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER.  LESS SKILLFUL PERSON WOULD HAVE PANICKED AND CAUSED SEVERE PILE-UP IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.    MANY OTHER AUDI OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THE PROBLEM ON THE VARIOUS COMPUTER LISTS AND WEB SITES USED BY AUDI OWNERS.  CALL OR WRITE FOR DETAILS.      AUDI DEALER WAS UNCONCERNED ABOUT PROBLEM AND PART IS NOT LISTED NOR CAN BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY.  MUST PURCHASE ENTIRE THROTTLE BODY AT COST OF OVER $800.  *NM",
