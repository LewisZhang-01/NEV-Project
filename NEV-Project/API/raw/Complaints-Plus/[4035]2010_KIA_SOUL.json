NOT OFFICIALLY-- Only that it has happened twice now.  1st occurrence--First week of July 2021 Heard the car running hours after the car was parked and the key removed.  Unlocked the driver door, put the key in and turned it forward, then back and car turned off. Double-checked it by starting car and then turning off and sitting a few minutes. Nothing else happened at that point.  ---2nd occurrence-Sunday, July 25th, 2021 On camping trip...at campsite Someone in the group heard a car running. It was the 2010 Kia Soul I went to get the key and returned to the (unlocked) car and turned the car off.   ---INSPECTED?  Not yet  ---WARNINGS? None that I noticed.  Though, shortly following the incident, while driving (first 5 minutes of starting car), the OD light came on. I pulled over, turned off car, and the light did not come on again.",

The electric system still worked but there was no engine activity whatsoever. There were no warning lamps or sounds prior to this event. The oil had been changed a week prior to this happening. Evidently from reading various reports online of the same type of events happening to other owners, it seems this is a known engine issue for multiple models of Kia cars. The car had to be towed to a garage where it was inspected and diagnostics were run. Dianostics determined: \"found metal beneath valve cover and camshaft damaged due to apparent lack of oiling - no compression present.\" This car had approximately 150k miles on it and was a 2010 Kia Soul ! 4.2 0L 1975CC FI GAS N 2 model.

THE MECHANIC MENTIONED THE UNUSUAL WEAR PATTERN ON THE BACK TIRES WHICH I HAD NOTICED AS WELL. THE TIRES WERE WEARING IN THE CENTER AND TO THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE TIRES. HE SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE THE SOUL TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ALIGN THE VEHICLE ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURERS SPECS. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT THE KIA DEALERSHIP TO DO SO. I HEARD THE MECHANIC SAY TO THE DEPT. MANAGER THAT THE CAR HAD ALREADY BEEN ALIGNED. AFTER A SHORT WAIT PERIOD THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE CAME BACK TO ME AND SAID THAT THE REAR AXLE HAD SHIFTED TO THE SIDE BY APPROX. 1/2\". I ASKED WHEN HE HAD SEEN THIS ON A VEHICLE, AND HE SAID AFTER AN ACCIDENT. I STATED THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, AND MY HUSBAND PURCHASED IT NEW. THE ESTIMATE FOR THE REPAIR FOR PARTS, LABOR, AND A NEW ALIGNMENT WAS $1090.00. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR KIA CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO RETURN A CALL TO ME ABOUT THE ISSUE. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DESIGN FLAW SINCE THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF RAIN/MOISTURE ON THE ROAD CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO HANDLE VERY POORLY AT REDUCED SPEEDS OF 45 MPH. THIS DEFECT HAS NOW COST 852.00 FOR NEW TIRES, AND THEY WILL WEAR OUT IN THE SAME ODD WEAR PATTERN IF I DON'T REPLACE THE REAR AXLE, AND RE-ALIGN THE TIRES THAT I JUST PURCHASED.  *TR",

THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS. 1. WHEN RELEASING THE CLUTCH PEDAL THERE WAS A NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A CABLE THAT HAS SINCE BECOME MORE CONSISTENT. ON 8/3/09, I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CABLE CONNECTED TO THE THROW-OUT BEARING WHICH WAS SAID TO BE NORMAL. HOWEVER, THIS CABLE NOISE HAS NOT BEEN NORMAL WITH ANY OF MY OTHER MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, NOR IS IT PRESENT IN ALL KIA SOULS. 2. I BEGAN TO NOTICE A KNOCKING SENSATION COMING THROUGH THE SHIFTER HANDLE WHEN SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR ALONG WITH A GRINDING SOUND WHEN DOWNSHIFTING INTO 2ND GEAR. THERE IS ALSO A SLIGHT JOLT WHEN SHIFTING INTO 2ND GEAR - IT IS NOT A SMOOTH TRANSITION LIKE THE OTHER GEARS. 3. WHEN AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT WITH THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE CAR WILL NOT GO INTO 1ST GEAR, AND WANTS TO GO INTO 3RD GEAR WHICH USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF TRIES BEFORE IT WILL GO INTO 1ST GEAR. 4. THERE HAS BEEN EXCESSIVE ENGINE REVVING 2X NOW. THE FIRST OCCURRED AFTER I CAME OUT OF REVERSE - THE SECOND  WAS WHEN I TRIED TO GO INTO 1ST GEAR BUT ENDED UP IN 3RD GEAR AND BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO NEUTRAL. 5. THE LAST ISSUE CONCERNS EXCESSIVE WATER AND DIRT ACCUMULATING IN THE ENGINE. AFTER WASHING MY CAR, I POPPED THE HOOD AND NOTICED THE HOOD LATCH IS ALREADY STRIPPED DOWN TO THE METAL AFTER ONLY BEING OPENED AND CLOSED 4-5 TIMES. THE ENGINE DESIGN SEEMS TO ATTRACT POOLS OF WATER IN CERTAIN AREAS, WHICH ALSO OCCURS WHEN IT RAINS, AND THERE IS CONCERN OF PREMATURE RUST. SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR 9/15 TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AT 1000 MILES AND TO GET THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED BUT HAD TO SCHEDULE A 3RD APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE DEALER NOW NEEDS TO KEEP THE CAR FOR 5 HOURS SO THE OUTCOME IS PENDING. *TR",
