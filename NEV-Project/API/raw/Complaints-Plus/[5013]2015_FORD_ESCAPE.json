It picked up speed again for about 30 seconds and then lost power again, this continued for about 2 minutes and then the Escape stopped moving in the middle of the highway in front of the Elementary School and the dash stated \u201cTransmission Fault/Service Now\u201d and Angela was suddenly stranded on the busy highway. Her husband Johnie drove his truck to the area where the Escape was setting and engine was still running but had no power to move. He turned the ignition off and restarted the Escape, the message was gone and vehicle ran and moved fine for about 30 seconds and then did the same actions again with shuddering , shaking, lose of power and \u201cTransmission Fault/Service Now\u201d on the dash. The vehicle had to be towed to Elkins Fordland, Inc in Elkins WV. On 12/30/2020 Elkins Fordland ran the diagnostic on the Escape at the cost of $111.30, they observed transmission pump making whinning noise and vehicle wouldn\u2019t move, recommended new transmission per code (See attached documents and Bills for diagnostic test and replacement of transmission).   On 01/01/2021 to 01/15/2021 Elkins Fordland, Inc had the Escape for transmission replacement. The cost to replace the transmission in the 2015 Ford Escape at Mileage 133926 was $5294.10 after tax.   This is a Safety Issue due to the no warning of Transmission Fault and the sudden loss of power in the busy highway.

They were able to get them removed and complete the tire installation, with 5 lug nuts needing to be replaced at a cost of $39.95. They suggested I purchase a full set of lug nuts and get them all replaced soon. There was no warning message alerting me to this issue so I had no idea until I tried to have the car serviced. Both Sam's and Goodyear said they see this problem often on Ford vehicles. Doing some research on the internet, I see that many people have this issue with Ford.",

However our vehicle is a 2015 Escape and we were told it was not covered by the recall although we experienced a similar issue.    Upon putting the vehicle in reverse the gearbox stuck in reverse and was not able to shift to neutral, drive, or any other gear.  Since the vehicle was stuck in gear and not able to move until the tow truck arrived it put others at risk.  We had the car towed to  Merrill Ford in Okemos Michigan where they confirmed the bushing failed however due to Ford's protocol they had to replace the entire shifter cable at an estimated price of $950.  I did some investigation and found another cable and requested the dealer remove the bushing from the new cable and install it on the vehicle.  I could have purchased just the bushing however the dealership advised against it.  In addition, the shifter cable was not available for approximately another week since 1,400 were on backorder which makes me believe this is a bigger problem than just our vehicle.  There were no prior warnings to the bushing failure.  Although the dealership knew there was an alternative solution of only replacing the bushing they originally refused to do it.  I find this practice of not replacing the failed part (bushing) negligent and trying to create more revenue for Ford and the dealership.",

However, now in September 2021, a \u201ctransmission fault service now\u201d error popped up while I was on the way to work. The diagnostics have come in and Ford is telling me I need an entirely new transmission. The car has less than 93K miles and should not be having a transmission issue, especially when a majority of the miles driven were freeway miles. Ford has quoted a repair cost of $6600, but I find it hard to believe that the incident in April is unrelated to the transmission failure today.",

The engine, sputtered, locked up, would not stay in drive and died. He had to maneuver to safety in the middle of the road on a dangerous bridge. We had the transmission supposedly replaced at Future Ford of Concord. This repair took close to three weeks. Upon return of the car, the same thing happened again. We returned the car to the dealer. It stayed for another four weeks while they ran diagnostics, and supposedly fixed the car. Not more than 100 miles later the car experienced the same thing as the original incident. My son was once again on the freeway, the car lost all power, the transmission light went on and the car is again currently at Future Ford of Concord. Cars should not have transmission problems such as this with only 100,000 miles. And, if the problem was fixed, then we should not have had to take the car back two additional times for the same thing. I believe there exists a significant problem with the transmission of this 2015 Ford EXCAPE.",

If paying thousands of dollars on a vehicle that I can hardly afford now isn't hard to swallow, the newly purchased engine will result in the same failure because FORD HAS'NT FIX THE PROBLEM. Ford refuses to put in a new engine and Ford has not fixed an issue that has been occurring for almost 10 years, forcing Ford owners into debt and bankruptcy because where would a person like me get the money to pay for something like this again and again?

I put the car in reverse and removed my front from the break and the car accelerated on its own again.  I applied the break again and it stopped, thankfully there were no other cars in the parking lot at that time.    On 5/24/2021 I called the Ford dealership where I purchased the vehicle, the service advisor said they were not aware of this issue.  I had the vehicle towed to the dealership that day as I was concerned that the issue would reoccur ($80.00).  The service advisor called on Wednesday and stated there were no codes on the computer related to acceleration but there were codes for the transmission. They were able to overhaul the transmission, $3999.41; there was only 38,384 miles on the vehicle, I have always been a responsible owner and maintained all of my vehicles - I have no doubt this was a defect.  I had no other issues with this vehicle prior to that day.",

In researching this problem we found that this is an ongoing problem with Fords design.  I had my car towed to my mechanic who scanned the codes, inspected the electronic steering gear, fuse. They had to remove and replace the complete steering gear.

FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE SAYS THAT THEY'LL PAY 1/4 OF THE COST TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I'VE FOUND QUITE A FEW ESCAPE OWNERS THAT HAVE HAD SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME ISSUE OF COOLANT LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY NEED A NEW ENGINE. THESE ENGINES ARE FAILING PREMATURELY DUE TO ENGINES OVER HEATING AND THE BLOCKS FAILING. I SUSPECT THAT THE COOLANT SENSOR IS ALSO DEFECTIVE. THIS 2015 ESCAPE WAS PURCHASED NEW AT THE END OF 2014, AND MAINTAINED BY REGULAR OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE.  *TR",

IT WAS TOWED TO THE SERVICE CENTER OF THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR. THE MAN THERE EXPLAINED TO ME THE REASON IT STOPPED ACCELERATING IS BECAUSE OF A 'SAFTEY' FEATURE CALLED LIMP MODE WHERE YOUR CAR SHIFTS INTO A LOWER GEAR TO AVOID FURTHER DAMAGE.

I PLACED SOME BAGS IN, TURNED TO GET MORE AND WHEN I TURNED BACK TO PUT THEM IN THE VEHICLE, I SLAMMED MY HEAD AGAINST THE LOWER EDGE OF THE LIFT GATE WHICH FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WAS IN THE PROCESS OF COMING DOWN. I OBTAINED A LACERATION APPROXIMATELY TWO AND A QUARTER INCHES IN LENGTH AND A SEVERE HEADACHE SHORTLY AFTER THAT. ON 05/04/2017, I CONTACTED OUR SALES PERSON AND HE SAID HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING AND FROM WHAT HE KNEW, HE THOUGHT THE LIFT GATE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO GO UP WITH THE FOOT ACTIVATION AND NOT DOWN BUT HE IS GOING TO RESEARCH IT FURTHER. I HAVE A CALL INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ALSO AND AM WAITING FOR A CALL BACK. THINKING OVER THE TIME WE HAVE OWNED THE ESCAPE, I NOW RECALL THAT HAPPENING ONE OTHER TIME BUT CAUGHT IT PRIOR TO HITTING IT. I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT THAT TIME.
