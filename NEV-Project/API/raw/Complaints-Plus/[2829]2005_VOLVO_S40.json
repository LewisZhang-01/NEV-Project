HERE IS THE BACKGROUND:  I DRIVE A 2005 VOLVO S40, T5 AWD. I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHOM HAS EVER OWNED THIS CAR.   IN SEPTEMBER 2011 MY FUEL PRESSURE SENSOR FAILED AND I WAS CHARGED APPROXIMATELY $550 AT THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT REPLACED. IT FAILED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I HAD ALSO EXPERIENCED POWER-SURGE TYPE BEHAVIORS DURING START-UP, AFTER THE CAR HAD SET OVERNIGHT OR DURING MY WORKDAY.    YESTERDAY, WITH THE KIDS IN THE CAR, I WAS DRIVING ALONG ABOUT 60MPH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IS WAS LIKE MY CAR HAD STALLED OUT.  THE BRAKES WORKED AND TURN SIGNALS WORKED. HOWEVER, THE STEERING HAD TIGHTENED UP.  ALL OF THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD WERE LIT. I COASTED TO THE FAR RIGHT LANE AND TURNED ON MY CAUTION LIGHTS, STILL BEING IN THE ACTUAL ROAD. I TURNED THE KEY OFF AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR. THE CAR STARTED OK.  AS SOON AS I ARRIVED HOME IT HAPPENED AGAIN; THIS WAS NOT EVEN 5 MILES AND 15 MINUTES LATER.  THE CURRENT FUEL PRESSURE SENSOR PART NUMBER SHOWS BOSCH PART- 31272730; WHICH, AGAIN, WAS NEW AS OF 2011. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART IS NOW FAILING- ALMOST 2 YEARS LATER AND LESS THAN 7,000 MILES LATER!  RECENTLY I HAVE ALSO FOUND THE ISSUES WITH THE POWER-SURGE DURING START UP HAVE BEGAN RECURRING.  UNTIL RESEARCHING THE ISSUE I WAS UNAWARE THERE WAS A RELATION BETWEEN THE POWER-SURGE AND FUEL PRESSURE SENSOR.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT ON MONDAY TO DROP OFF MY CAR AT VOLVO. AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE ROOT CAUSE AND COMPLETE SCOPE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN VOLVO RECALL #181 OR THAT REPLACING THIS PART WILL CORRECT THE SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",

WHEN I FIRST TURN THE CAR ON AND DRIVE OFF, THE A/C STARTS COOLING AND WORKING JUST FINE. HOWEVER, WHEN IT IS 90F OR ABOVE, THE A/C BEGINS TO BLOW WARM AIR AFTER A FEW MINUTES. WHEN THAT HAPPENS I HAVE TO TURN IT OFF AND BACK ON A FEW TIMES TO GET IT WORKING AGAIN BUT IT ONLY WORKS FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I HAVE TO REPEAT \"ON/OFF\" RITUAL. USUALLY, IF I LEAVE IT OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES IT WORKS FOR A BIT LONGER TIME BEFORE IT STOPS AGAIN.    THIS PROBLEM 1ST APPEARED WHEN IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR OLD @ ABOUT 9-10K MILES BUT IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE AND WAS FINE AFTER I TURNED OFF AND BACK ON.  2ND TIME HAPPENED ABOUT 1-1/2 YRS AGO WHEN IT WAS AROUND 35K MILES BUT WAS THE SAME AS THE FIRST TIME AND WAS OK AFTER TURNING OFF AND BACK ON. NOW FOR THE PAST YEAR IT IS CONSTANT!!  THIS HAPPENS DAILY!! THE CAR IS ONLY NOW 47K.    I TOOK IT TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP YESTERDAY AND I BARELY BEGAN EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM AND BEFORE I EVEN FINISHED DESCRIBING IT, THE SERVICE ADVISOR FINISHED BY TELLING ME THE REST. HE TOLD ME HE KNEW THE STORY B/C HE HEARD IT MANY TIMES BEFORE. HE SAID IT WAS MOST LIKELY THE COMPRESSOR CLUTCH, COMPRESSOR, OR BOTH. HE SAID THAT IT IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM WITH THAT VEHICLE AND THAT THEY DO THE SAME REPAIRS REPEATEDLY AND THAT IT SEEMED LIKE A SPECIFIC PROBLEM ON THOSE VEHICLES.    TODAY, I BEGAN DOING SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND SEVERAL SITES WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKING ONLINE ADVISORS WHAT THIS PROBLEM COULD BE. PER MY ONLINE RESEARCH AND THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE ADVISOR THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR.

IN ADDITION, THE BRAKE PEDAL IS ABOUT 1.5 INCHES HIGHER THAN THE GAS PEDAL SO MANY TIMES THE FOOT WILL BE CAUGHT UNDER THE PEDAL.  THIS IS A HIGHLY DANGEROUS DESIGN AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  OTHER DRIVERS HAVE REPORTED THIS BUT VOLVO IS NOT WILLING TO RETROFIT THE PEDALS.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NON-T5 VERSION DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THIS BAD DESIGN NOR DOES THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  THIS SAFETY DEFECT, IF NOT CORRECTED, WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT FOR DRIVERS OF THIS SPECIFIC CAR.  ON JULY 27, I ALMOST GOT IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE MY FOOT GOT STUCK UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.  WHILE I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER CAR AND ALMOST CRASHING ONTO THE SIDEWALK, I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT MANY ACCIDENTS CAN BE AVOIDED IF VOLVO WAS TO REDESIGN OR RETROFIT THE SPACING OF THE GAS AND BRAKE PEDALS ON THE VOLVO S40 T5 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS.
