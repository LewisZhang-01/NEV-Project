        "summary": "My tire pressure monitoring system showed a low tire.  I looked and found no nails or other items in the tire.  I changed to my spare and took the tire to the tire dealer.  He found a crack in the rim near the valve stem - started at the hole. This happened in March of this year.   On a recent trip, the same thing happened on another rim.  The crack this time was also near the valve stem hole.  The crack this time went the direction of the circumference of the rim for about 1\".  The Les Schwab dealer said he has seen this several times on other vehicles. Neither wheel/rim would hold air pressure.   If the crack had been worse, I could have had a wheel/rim failure and possibly crash.  I also was on remote roads in Idaho and could have been stranded if the spare wheel would have cracked.",
