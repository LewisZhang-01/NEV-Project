The symptoms began yesterday - February 11, 2022.  I did bring the vehicle to Bob McCosh Chevrolet in Columbia, Missouri.  They reported there are no recalls on that system.  But as the article link above confirms, I am certainly not alone in this problem.    I believe this problem is being investigated but no recall has been issued.  I will also follow up with the service manager at Bob McCosh Chevrolet in Columbia, Missouri.  I will escalate to the regional service manager for Chevrolet.  In the meantime, it would be very helpful if the weight of the FHTSA could get behind this problem.    I can be reached at [XXX] if you have additional questions.  My email is [XXX].    Thank you.

The gas line is rusted and leaking, there is a strong odor of gasoline at the rear drivers side tire of my car and I can feel/ see the fuel leaking. I have been driving my 4 month old son around in that car for months and had no idea fuel was leaking and I was putting both of our safety at risk! I called my local chevy dealership about fixing it and they said it will be at least $1300 to repair the leak and more if the gas tank needs to be replaced.

I HAD MINE REPLACED AT NATIONAL CHAIN REPAIR SHOP FOR ABOUT $600 COMPARED TO WHAT DEALER WOULD HAVE CHARGED. LOOKING AT DATABASE THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE DUE TO THE NATURE OF IT BEING A FUEL LEAK, ESPECIALLY WITH EXHAUST SO CLOSE TO THE LEAK. A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ISSUED OR EXPANDED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY WHILE DRIVING. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR CAR BLOWING UP OR CATCHING FIRE.     DEALERS SEEM CLUELESS AS DOES THE MANUFACTURER WHICH WILL PROBABLY NOW CLAIM THIS IS DUE TO AGE OF THE CAR SINCE MANY REPORTS ARE ON CARS 10 YEARS OLD AT THIS POINT.",

NOW I HAVE A STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE FROM UNDER DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL AREA AFTER BEING DRIVEN FOR A WHILE AND THEN PARKED . I CALLED THE GM HOTLINE THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND ONLINE AND THEY SAID THAT ITS AN OUT OF POCKET PROBLEM AND THAT MY VIN DOESN'T  QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL WHICH HAS BEEN ISSUED IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES FOR FREE OF CHARGE. HOW CAN THIS BE ALLOWED,FIXED IN ONE STATE FREE OF CHARGE BY GM AND NOT FIXED AT ALL IN ANOTHER. A FUEL PROBLEM OR A LEAK OF ANT KIND SHOULD BE A CONCERN FOR GM AND IS A MAJOR ISSUE.I'M LOCATED IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT MY VIN SAYS I DON'T QUALIFY FOR THIS RECALL OFFERED ELSEWHERE,SO SHOULD  I HAVE TO FOOT A REPAIR BILL FOR AN ISSUE THAT GM MOST DEFINITELY KNOWS ABOUT. I'M CONFUSED, THE PROBLEM IS THE SAME AS BEING DESCRIBED ON THE RECALL FOR THE OTHER AREAS YET I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE THIS RECALL IS NOT IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE RECALL SHOULD BE FOR ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES NOT JUST SOME OF THEM AND FREE OF CHARGE  .I RELAYED INFO TO A GM REP ON 9/10 /18 IN THE EVENING AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS APOLIGIZE AND THEN TELL ME THAT IT DEPENDED ON WHICH MANUFACTURING PLANT MADE THE VEHICLE. WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT STUMPS ME I TOLD HER THAT IS SHODDY AND SUB STANDARD  WORK SHOULD BE REPAIRED AT GENERAL MOTORS EXPENSE NOT HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA $1000 OR SO SITTING AROUND TO SHELL OUT. ALL I SEEM TO BE GETTING IS THE RUN AROUND. A PROBLEM LIKE THIS SHOULD BE OF GRAVE CONCERN TO GENERAL MOTORS AND NOT  GIVEN SO SOME OWNERS AND NOT OTHERS. I'M SURE IF IT WAS THEIR VEHICLE IT WOULD BE PROMPTLY RECALLED AND REPAIRED. PLEASE HELP IF POSSIBLE. THIS JUST ISN'T GOOD BUSINESS GENERAL MOTORS NEEDS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR ALL.

WE NOTICED THE SIZE DIFFERENCE IN THE TIRES RIGHT AWAY, REGULAR TIRE IS P205/55R16 H, THE SPARE IS A T115/70D15 M. THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL TIRES THAT CHEVROLET PUT ON THE CAR. THE MANUAL SAID WE COULD GO NORMAL SPEED.  I DROVE A BLOCK TO GET THE TIRE FIXED AND TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK HOME.  THE CAR DIPPED HORRIBLE AND DRAGGED WHEN I PULLED BACK INTO MY DRIVE WAY. IT ALSO MADE RUBBING SOUNDS. IT DID NOT FILL SAFE TO DRIVE.  WE TOOK THE TIRE IN AND HAD IT FIXED WITHOUT THE CAR, BROUGHT IT HOME AND PUT IT BACK ON CAR. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CHEVROLET SINCE THEN TO SEE IF IT WAS AN ERROR ON THE SPARE.  THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT IS THE RIGHT SPARE, ALTHOUGH A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TALKED TO THOUGHT IT WAS BAD TO HAVE A 15 INCH SPARE WITH 16 INCH TIRES.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NEED TO DO IS IF THE FLAT IS ON THE FRONT I'M SUPPOSE TO CHANGE TWO TIRES.  THEY TOLD ME TO PUT A BACK TIRE ON THE FRONT AND THE SPARE ON THE BACK, WHICH IS NOT THE DIRECTION IN THE MANUAL.  THEY TOLD ME I CAN GO 50 MPH AND GET THE TIRE FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO NOW OUT ON A BUSY HIGHWAY THEY WANT ME TO CHANGE TWO TIRES AND HAVE THE BACK OF MY CAR DIP HORRIBLY.  I FEEL THIS SPARE IS UNSAFE BECAUSE IT IS SMALLER THEN THE TIRES IT IS REPLACING. IT MAKES THE CAR TILT SO YOU CAN'T DRIVE AT SAFE SPEEDS NOT TO SAY THE DAMAGE YOU CAN DO TO YOUR CAR. I LEAVE IN A RURAL AREA AND SOME OF THE ROADS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SHOULDER TO CHANGE ONE SPARE LET ALONE TWO.",

MY SON, OF THAI DESCENT WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH ENGLISH HAS ADVISED ME THAT HE HAS SEEN THE LIGHT COME ON INTERMITTENTLY.  THE LETTER STATES THAT IF THE LIGHT IS INTERMITTENT THAT IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS CONDITION MAY BE PRESENT.  SINCE GM IS NOT WILLING TO CONSIDER MY VEHICLE FOR REPAIR SINCE THE LIGHT IS NOT CONTINUOUSLY LIT I CONSIDER THIS LETTER A SAFETY WARNING AND WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS SUBJECT OF MY COMPLAINT.

IN FEBRUARY 2014, THE RATTLE RETURNED FOR THE 4TH TIME AND THE STEERING COLUMN WAS REPLACED.  ON NOVEMBER 2, 2011 THE CONSUMER ATTEMPTED TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO. THE DEALER REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH. THE OLD SWITCH HAD COMPLETELY APART INSIDE THE STEERING COLUMN. *JB",

THIS BULLETIN IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AT HTTP://5HIZN1T.VACAU.COM/10256.HTM#SS2-2552146.  IT UPSETS ME THAT GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT FAILS TO TAKE ANY MEANINGFUL ACTION.  THEIR \"SERVICE BULLETIN\" REMEDY IS ILLUSORY AT BEST.  WHEN I TOOK A COPY OF THIS BULLETIN TO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP THEY DID NOT HONOR IT.  THEY SAID MY CAR WAS NOT ONE OF THE 2009 COBALTS THAT WERE INCLUDED. HOW NOT MY CAR DID THE SAME THING AS THEY WARNED. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS PHYSICALLY HARMED BY GM'S NEGLIGENCE IN THIS OCCURRENCE; HOWEVER IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT IF THIS PROBLEM GOES UNRESOLVED THAT SOMEONE WILL BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.  *TR",

THE FIRST WAS A REAR END COLLISION IN EARLY JULY, APPROXIMATELY 5 DAYS AFTER I HAD THE TIRES INSTALLED ON MY CAR.  WHEN I NEEDED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY STOP THE FRONT WHEELS LOCKED UP AND THE CAR SKIDDED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF MINE, THAT HAD MANAGED TO STOP BEFORE HITTING A CAR THAT HAD SWERVED IN FRONT OF HIM.  THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON OCT 14, 2011.  I WAS GOING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION DURING A RAINSTORM.  THE INTERSECTION HAS A SLIGHT LEFT BEND TO IT.  I WAS TRAVELING AT 35-40 MPH WHEN A VAN TRIED TO MAKE A LEFT TURN IN FRONT OF ME.  HE WAS WAY TOO CLOSE AND I HAD TO HIT THE BRAKES HARD. THE  FRONT WHEELS IMMEDIATELY LOCKED UP AND MY CAR ROTATED 90 DEGREES COUNTERCLOCKWISE WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN AT ALL.  FORTUNATELY, THE DRIVER OF THE VAN REALIZED THAT HE HAD SCREWED UP AND GOT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION RAPIDLY AND A COLLISION WAS AVOIDED. THEN LAST NIGHT, OCT. 16TH, AGAIN IN THE RAIN, I TRIED TO STOP AT A YELLOW LIGHT ON A SLIGHT DOWNHILL GRADE FROM ABOUT 45 MPH.  AGAIN THE WHEELS LOCKED UP AND THE CAR SKIDDED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AT ABOUT 40 MPH.    I HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINCE 1973 AND HAVE LOGGED OVER A MILLION MILES.  THESE FUZION TOURING TIRES ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIRES I HAVE EVER DRIVEN ON, ESPECIALLY ON WET PAVEMENT.  I HAVE HAD OTHER TIRES ON MY COBALT AND NEVER HAD ANY SIMILAR INCIDENTS.  I AM REPLACING THEM TOMORROW BECAUSE MY LIFE IS WORTH MORE TO ME THAN THE $400 THAT A SET OF TIRES COSTS.  DRIVING IN THE RAIN WITH THOSE TIRES IS LIKE DRIVING ON ICE WITH NORMAL TIRES.  THESE TIRES ARE POTENTIALLY DEADLY AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY AND THEN SHREDDED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE NO TRACTION, TREADWEAR, OR TEMPERATURE RATINGS ON THESE TIRES.  THE SIZE IS195/60-15, 88H.  I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT THESE ARE FUZION TOURING TIRES, NOT FUZION HRI.  I HAD A SET OF FUZION HRI'S AND THEY WERE FINE.  *TR",

THERE IS ALSO THE CHANCE THAT THE SYSTEM COULD FAIL COMPLETELY CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  FINALLY, THE SCREECHING SOUND IS GETTING WORSE.

EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE, FRONT AND REAR PADS LOOKED ALMOST NEW WITH PLENTY OF MEAT ON THEM.  IN JULY, I NOTICED THAT THE REAR BRAKES WERE STARTING TO GROOVE, SO I MENTIONED THIS TO THE DEALER WHEN I WENT IN FOR A RECALL AND THEY RESURFACED THEM FOR ME (22,885 MILES).  I ASKED ABOUT THE PADS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD LOOKED AT THEM AND THEY WERE FINE AND EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL.  IN OCTOBER, I NOTICED THE GROOVING COMING BACK.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER, AND THEY CHARGED ME TO REPLACE THE REAR DISKS AND PADS AT 29,170 MILES (THEY DID THROW IN THE ROTORS FOR FREE DUE TO THE ABNORMAL WEAR).      AFTER THE SERVICE, THEY GAVE ME THE OLD REAR PADS AS PER MY REQUEST.  UPON RECEIVING THEM, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT THE INNER REAR PAD, WHICH HAD BEEN WEARING IDENTICALLY TO THE OUTER REAR PADS WHEN I CHECKED AT 18,000 MILES, WERE WORN ALMOST TO THE BACKING PLATE!  THE OUTER PADS STILL HAD 1/4\" MATERIAL LEFT, SO IT SEEMED CLEAR THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT.  THE DEALER COULD FIND NO REASON FOR THIS WEAR AND STATED THAT EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL BESIDES THE BRAKE WEAR.  IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT A FRONT-HEAVY, FRONT-DRIVE CAR WOULD WEAR THROUGH ITS INNER REAR BRAKE PADS WHILE ITS FRONT PADS (WHICH DO MOST OF THE BRAKING) AND OUTER REAR PADS STILL HAVE PLENTY OF LIFE LEFT WITHOUT THERE BEING SOME KIND OF PROBLEM.  I STILL HAVE THE PADS AND ALSO HAVE PICTURES.    I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THESE PADS WEAR DOWN SO QUICKLY, I COULD BE PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE I UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE NO E-BRAKE AND COMPROMISED BRAKING ABILITY DESPITE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT GM IS MORE INTERESTED IN SELLING ME PARTS THAN IN DIAGNOSING AND CORRECTING THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

CAR SPUN OUT TWICE AND HIT THE JERSEY WALL TWICE.   THEN I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR.  FAIRLY HEAVY TRAFFIC, AND NO OTHER VEHICLES INVOLVED, THANK GOD.  STATE POLICE WERE ON THE SHOULDER FOR TRAFFIC GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION ACROSS FROM ME BUT DID NOT COME TO THE CAR.  INCIDENT 2.  RENTED ANOTHER OF THE SAME MODEL.  WHENEVER THE STREET WAS WET, THE CAR DID NOT BRAKE WELL.  SEEMED TO BE VERY SHORT PERIODS OF NOT BRAKING.  WHEN SLOWLY STARTING FROM A STOPPED POSITION, THE WHEELS SPUN AND THEN TOOK HOLD.

WE THE SERVICE PEOPLE COULD NOT FIND ANY BALD SPOTS THEY RULED THE BRAKE AS A DEFECT AND COVERED THEM UNDER WARRANTY.  I JUST FIND IT UNUSUAL THAT THE REAR BRAKES WOULD DO THIS SO EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE FRONT BRAKES LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE BARELY BEEN TOUCHED.  IF I HAD BEEN TAKING A TURN OR HAVING TO BRAKE IN AN EMERGENCY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHEN I HAVE REAR METAL TO METAL INSTEAD OF THE OEM BRAKE PADS TO PROTECT ME. *TR",
