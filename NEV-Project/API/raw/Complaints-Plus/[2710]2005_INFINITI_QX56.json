THIS OCCURRENCE COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR WORSE, A FATALITY. AS A RESULT OF POLICE ASSISTANCE AND HAVING MY VEHICLE TOWED DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP, TO DATE THERE ARE NO MECHANICAL ISSUES FOUND BY THE DEALER RELATED TO MY VEHICLE SHUTTING DOWN AT THE INTERSECTION.   MY COMPLAINT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL SERIOUS VEHICLE ISSUES REGARDING MY HEADLIGHTS, INSTRUMENT CLUSTER/PANEL, AND THE FUSE BOX UNDER THE HOOD. BOTH HEADLIGHTS ON MY VEHICLE SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING AT THE SAME TIME. THE BULBS WERE REPLACED AND THE HEADLIGHT FUSES WERE FOUND TO BE FUNCTIONING.   THE INSTRUMENT PANEL/CLUSTER LIGHT BLINKS CONSTANTLY AS I DRIVE AND THE PANEL/CLUSTER GAUGES ARE COMPLETELY NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. FUSES HAVE BEEN CHECKED UNDER THE VEHICLE?S HOOD AND RESULTS INDICATE SOME OF THE 10 AMP FUSES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING AT ALL.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SAFETY RECALL REGARDING MY 2005 INFINITI QX 56, WHICH APPEARS TO JEOPARDIZE MY SAFETY. THERE ARE NO LEGITIMATE ANSWERS OR EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY MY VEHICLE?S HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT WORKING, THE CLUSTER/PANEL HAS MALFUNCTIONED, OR WHY SOME FUSES UNDERNEATH MY VEHICLE?S HOOD ARE NOT FUNCTIONING. AS A RESULT OF MY VEHICLE?S EXPIRED WARRANTY AND MECHANICAL FAILURES, I HAVE CONSUMED A GREAT DEAL OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES, INCLUDING A TRAFFIC CITATION REGARDING MY HEADLIGHTS. I AM LIMITED AND INCONVENIENCED TO DRIVING MY VEHICLE AT NIGHT AS A RESULT OF MY INOPERABLE HEADLIGHTS WHICH CAN CAUSE ME GREAT HARM.

THE TRANSMISSION WAS LOSING  ATF THROUGH THE RADIATOR'S PRESSURE RELIEF POINTS AN LOST THE ABILITY TO PROPEL THE CAR WITHIN ONE BLOCK. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN INTO A NEARBY DRIVE AND WAS UNABLE TO MOVE AFTER THAT POINT. THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE LEAD TO A CRASH SITUATION. THE SECOND PART OF INCIDENT IS THE COOLANT CONTAMINATED THE TRANSMISSION AND CAUSED A SHORT TERM FRICTION MATERIAL FAILURE 4 MONTHS LATER. THE RADIATOR WAS REPLACED AND TRANSMISSION CLEANED AND FLUSHED. THE TRANSMISSION WORKED UNTIL AUGUST 20, 2013. THE TRANSMISSION LOST CONTACT WITH 5TH BAND AT 60 MPH  ON A INTERSTATE AND WAS NO LONGER PROPELLING THE CAR. A SHIFT INTO THE 4TH BAND GOT THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND IT WAS TOWED FOR REPAIR. THE ANTIFREEZE HAD DISSOLVED THE FRICTION MATERIAL CONSTRUCTION AND CORRODED VALVE PARTS. IT WAS REBUILT AND THE DESTRUCTION CONFIRMED. BOTH INCIDENTS COULD EASILY HAVE CAUSED A CRASH. INFINITY SENT US NO WARNING  AND SAY THERE IS NO PROBLEM OR RECALL. THE REPAIR SHOP HAS REPAIRED 5 OTHER INFINITY QX56 CARS FOR THE SAME FAILURES BEFORE MY CAR WAS REPAIRED. NISSAN N.
