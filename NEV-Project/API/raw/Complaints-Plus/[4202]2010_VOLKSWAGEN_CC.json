RECALL DESCRIPTION: HAIR OR OTHER FIBERS MAY CONTAMINATE THE AIRBAG CLOCK SPRING (A SPIRAL WOUND, FLAT CABLE THAT KEEPS THE AIRBAG POWERED WHILE THE STEERING WHEEL IS BEING TURNED). THIS CONTAMINATION MAY TEAR THE CABLE AND RESULT IN A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO THE DRIVER'S FRONTAL AIRBAG. A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO THE DRIVER'S FRONTAL AIRBAG WILL PREVENT THE AIRBAG FROM DEPLOYING IN THE EVENT OF A VEHICLE CRASH, INCREASING THE RISK OF INJURY.     ON FEBRUARY 29, 2016, VW DID A RECALL REPAIR BY INSTALLING A COVER OVER THE CLOCK SPRING.    ON NOVEMBER 22, 2017, I WAS DRIVING AND WHEN I MADE A TURN, I HEARD A POP IN MY STEERING WHEEL.   MY AIRBAG LIGHT IMMEDIATELY CAME ON ALONG WITH AN AIRBAG ERROR.  I LOST THE USE OF MY HORN AND THE CONTROLS ON MY STEERING WHEEL, ALONG WITH MY AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT.    I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THIS SEEN ABOUT.  I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD TO REPLACE THE CLOCK SPRING FOR A FEE OF $877.88.  I QUESTIONED THIS BECAUSE IT WAS A RECALL ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THAT THE REPAIR WAS COVERED FOR 12 MONTHS/12,000 MILES (WHICH EVER CAME FIRST) AND IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  FIRST OF ALL, THE CLOCK SPRING WAS NOT REPLACED, A COVER WAS PUT ON IT.  HOW DO I NOT KNOW THAT THERE WERE FIBERS IN THE CLOCK SPRING BEFORE THE COVER WAS PUT ON?

I SAW THAT VW USED TO PROVIDE A SAFETY RECALL AND EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR DSG TRANSMISSION FOR CERTAIN MODELS IN 2007 TO 2010. I ALSO FOUND ONLINE THAT THERE ARE MANY REPORTED DSG-RELATED FAILURES. I, JUST AS MANY VW OWNERS DO, HAVE EXPERIENCED DELAYS AT SHIFT POINTS, CAUSING ERRATIC SHIFTING, JERKING, LONG STALL PAUSES, CLUTCH SLIPPING, SURGING IN FORWARD AND REVERSE, ETC. WHILE THE CAR IS EITHER ACCELERATING, PASSING OR CRUISING. HOWEVER, MY 2010 VW CC (55K MILEAGE) IS NOT UNDER THIS EXTENDED WARRANTY. I THINK IT'S VERY RIDICULOUS, SINCE I'VE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF MY VEHICLE, BUT HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED 3 SAFETY RECALL (INCLUDING TAKATA RECALL AND FUEL PUMP RECALL), AND THIS TIME THEY REFUSE TO REIMBURSE MY COSTS INCURRED BY THEIR COMMONLY-KNOWN DANGEROUS TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I'M ALREADY HUGELY INFLUENCED BY THIS MODEL'S SAFETY RECALLS, AND DON'T WANT TO PAY $2400 FOR THEIR DESIGN DEFECTS. EVEN IF I REPAIR IT AT MY OWN EXPENSE, IT'S HARD TO SAY SUCH A BAD TRANSMISSION WILL NOT CAUSE OTHER DANGER OR TROUBLE IN THE FUTURE. IF THIS IS THE SAME DSG TRANSMISSION THAT'S REPORTED TO BE TROUBLESOME, THEIR WARRANTY/RECALL SHOULD BE FAIRLY PROVIDED TO ALL INFLUENCED VEHICLES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!",

I TOOK IT TO A VW DEALER, WHO REPLACED THE CRIMP CONNECTIONS TO THE FILTER.  NOW AGAIN LAST MONTH, THE SAME PROBLEM HAS RECURRED.  THE LEAK APPEARS TO BE COMING NOT FROM THE CRIMPED FUEL-LINE, BUT FROM SOME SORT OF QUICK-CONNECT TYPE OF FITTING THAT CONNECTS TO THE LOWER FILTER.  NOTE THAT THE PROBLEM ONLY SEEMS TO OCCUR UPON START-UP IN THE MORNING, BUT DISAPPEARS SOME TIME LATER, SO THAT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TAKEN IN TO A DEALER, THERE IS NO LEAK TO BE OBSERVED.  FROM LOOKING ON THE INTERNET, I HAVE FOUND THAT 1993 EUROVANS WERE SUBJECT TO A RECALL IN CANADA FOR LEAKING FUEL LINES, BUT NOTHING EVER IN THE US.  EVIDENTLY, THE PROBLEM IS STILL ONGOING AS I HAVE READ DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS AND POSTINGS ON THE INTERNET THAT DESCRIBED FUEL LEAKS HERE IN THE US, SOME OF WHICH INDICATE FUEL LEAK-RELATED FIRES HAVE COMPLETELY BURNED EUROVANS TO THE GROUND.
