CHECKING THE ENGINES LIST ORIGINALLY ON THE RECALL REPORT FROM AUGUST 16TH 2017 I'VE FOUND THE SAME PART NUMBER INSTALLED IN OUR CAR AND EVEN FORM THE SAME SUPPLIER (KUHNKE AUTOMOTIVE GMBH). IT'S NOT A NEW CAR BUT CONSIDERING IT'S A POTENTIAL FAILURE TO OCCUR WHILE THE CAR IS RUNNING SINCE THE INSTALLED PART NUMBER IS THE SAME, THE RISK OF A VEHICLE CRASH IS PRESENT ACCORDONG TO THE DECLARATION IN THE SAFETY RECALL REPORT. HOW SHOULD I CONTACT AUDI IN MEXICO OR USA TO ASK FOR THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATION OR ACTIONS? OF COURSE IT0'S OUT OF WARRANTY PERIOD BUT THE RISK COULD BE PRESENT IN MY CAR.",

I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT I AM THE SECOND PERSON WITH NEARLY IDENTICAL WHEEL FAILURE AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP! I CONTACTED AUDI AGAIN AND INFORMED THEM OF MY FINDINGS. THEY STILL SHOWED NO INTEREST. I INFORMED AUDI'S REPRESENTATIVE THAT I WOULD BE CONTACTING YOUR DEPARTMENT AND ENDED THE CONVERSATION. IT IS MY BELIEVE THAT THE 18\" WHEELS ON MY CAR ARE UNSAFE AND DO NOT MEET FEDERAL IMPACT STANDARDS. THE DEALERSHIP EMPLOYEE WHO INFORMED ME OF THE \"OTHER PERSON'S WHEEL ISSUE\" WILL NOT COME FORWARD FOR FEAR OF LOOSING HIS JOB.  SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.
