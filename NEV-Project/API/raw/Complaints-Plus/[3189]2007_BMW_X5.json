This results in the brake light indicator to emit little or no visible warning to other drivers, since the indicator bulb has fallen down outside of the casing.  Because the indicator may not be visible to other drivers, it presents a hazard of others not being warned that I am braking and could result in drivers of other vehicles not being prepared to brake and therefore could result in a collision that can vary from minor fender bender to fatal collision. It could also result in a more devastating vehicle fire that could destroy more than just the indicator housing.  It is visible and is reproduced every time vehicle brake pedal is depressed and brake indicators are engaged. Problem has been confirmed by BMW of South Austin.  This specific vehicle has yet to be inspected by insurance, police, manufacturer or others, but is a known problem with these rear indicator housing assemblies that are present on both sides of the vehicle.  No warning chimes or signals were present before, during, or after incident, and to this day, there are still no warning signals, signs, chimes, or indicators present.",

THE COOLANT LEAKS ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE ENGINE THROUGH A RANDOM HOLE AROUND THE ENGINE. IT IS A RATHER COSTLY FIX DUE TO SEVERAL COMPONENTS NEEDING TO BE REMOVED BEFORE ONE CAN GET TO THE BROKEN PART TO BE REPLACED. IT IS UNFAIR FOR CURRENT OWNERS TO HAVE TO PAY SIGNIFICANTLY FOR A CAR THAT HAS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS CURRENT UNFORTUNATE DISCOVERY. MY CAR SUDDENLY LEAKED ALL THE COOLANT OUT OF THE CAR AND INTO THE ROAD AND MY DRIVEWAY. THANKFULLY I WAS ALMOST HOME WHEN IT BROKE DOWN. I COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FREEWAY OR ON THE STREET AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RISK OF GETTING HIT BY OTHER CARS IF MY CAR JUST SUDDENLY STALLED. AND I WAS DRIVING WITH BABY ON BOARD! I SUGGEST THIS BE INVESTIGATED, AS IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S APPARENTLY VERY COMMON IN THE N62 ENGINES.",

ONCE I HAD REMOVED THE WATER AND LET IT DRY OUT I CHARGED THE BATTERY AND WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR. WHEN I GOT IT TO START, THE DASHBOARD LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE. MY ABS, TRACTION CONTROL, BRAKE, CHECK ENGINE, 4X4 LIGHTS ALL LIT UP AMONGST SOME OTHER WARNING LIGHTS. I WAS UNABLE TO PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE OR REVERSE AND HAD TO MANUALLY PUSH IT IN THE GARAGE. THE CAR IS STUCK IN A LIMP MODE/SAFE MODE. AFTER I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THE ISSUE I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM FOR BMW'S. I LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A US DISTRICT COURT RULING AGAINST THIS ISSUE AND THAT BMW 5 SERIES CARS BETWEEN 2004-2010 WERE COVERED IN A RECALL. THE RECALL IS DUE TO FAULTY WATER DRAIN TUBES COMING FROM THE SUNROOF AND WHEN THEY GET CLOGGED THE WATER DRAINS INTO THE TRUNK WHERE THE BATTERY IS LOCATED AMONGST OTHER IMPORTANT ELECTRONIC ELEMENTS. I HAVE CONTACTED MY LOCAL BMW DEALER AS WELL AS BMW OF NORTH AMERICA AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE QUITE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR ME AS THE RECALL PERTAINS ONLY TO THE 5 SERIES VEHICLES. IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT BMW IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT BECAUSE THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT SPECIFIES ONLY 5 SERIES CARS THEY CAN USE THAT AS A LOOPHOLE AND LEAVE OTHERS TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.",

WHEN I STARTED MY 2007 BMW X5 3.0SI TO DRIVE HOME, I WAS GREETED WITH A BUNCH OF WARNINGS AND ERRORS ON BOTH MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND NAVIGATION DISPLAY. THE MOST MAJOR ONE READ \"ELECTRONIC SYSTEM MALFUNCTION: TAKE TO NEAREST BMW CENTER.\" THE ABS LIGHT WAS ALSO LIT UP. SINCE IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT, THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSED AND SO I PROCEEDED TO TRY TO DRIVE HOME.    ON THE DRIVE HOME, I NOTICED THAT MY A/C SYSTEM SHUT ITSELF OFF AND THAT MY TURN SIGNALS WERE EXTREMELY LAGGY & AT TIMES, WERE NOT EVEN TURNING ON ' A REAL TRAFFIC HAZARD. FORTUNATELY, I MADE IT HOME, BUT TURNING THE CAR OFF WAS TRICKY BECAUSE EACH TIME, ODDLY, THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE CAR AND AMBIENT LIGHTING ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CAR WERE STILL LIT EVEN WHEN I REMOVED THE KEYFOB AND LOCKED THE CAR. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE RADIO UNIT, THE ENGINE START BUTTON.    THE NEXT MORNING, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE BMW DEALERSHIP AND THEY CHARGED ME $200+ JUST TO PERFORM DIAGNOSTICS ON THE CAR. THEY ENDED UP FINDING NOTHING AND SUGGESTED THAT I PAY MORE FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF THE TWO FRONT SEATS AND INSPECT THE WIRES UNDER THE CARPET IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR (I FOUND OUT THAT THIS BECAUSE THEY KNEW ABOUT NHTSA ITEM #: 10032845 / SERVICE BULLETIN # SIB-61-13-07). I DECLINED BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY ALL FOR THEM TO NOT BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING AGAIN.    AS OF JULY 28, 2012, THE ELECTRICAL ISSUE STILL OCCURS AFTER A MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINSTORM. I BELIEVE (ALONG WITH MANY BMW X5 OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE) THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH A FAULTY DRAINAGE PIPE RELATING TO THE PANORAMIC MOONROOF, WHICH ALLOWS FOR WATER TO LEAK INSIDE THE CAR AND SCREW UP THE CAR'S WIRING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING. THIS IS SOMETHING BMW SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR & REPAIR AT NO COST.    WHY SHOULD I PAY TO RESOLVE A DESIGN FLAW THAT BMW MADE!??  *TR",

HOWEVER, ONCE WE STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR NOT STARTING, THAT WAS NO LONGER A \"MINOR\" ISSUE. THE FIRST TIME THE CAR DID NOT START WAS AROUND THANKSGIVING IN 2008, ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER I HAD PURCHASE MY CAR. BY THE SUMMER OF 2009, THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE AND HALF THE TIME THE CAR WOULD NOT START. WE FINALLY TOOK THE CAR IN (NOV 2009) AND THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US THE BATTERY WAS DEATH, AND THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY AT NO CHARGE (WARRANTY). EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL MARCH 26, 2011, WHEN I WAS READY TO LEAVE AND MY CAR DID NOT START. AT THIS POINT, I WAS SO FRUSTRATED THAT I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM I DID NOT WANT A CAR THAT DOESN'T WORK PARKED IN MY GARAGE, SO I WAS GOING TO DROP IT OFF. IT WAS A SATURDAY, SO I DID NOT HEAR BACK FROM THE DEALERSHIP UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, ONLY TO TELL ME THAT THE BATTERY WAS VERY LOW AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY DRIVING HABITS, BECAUSE MOST OF MY TRIPS ARE VERY SHORT (LESS THAN 5 MI) TRIPS. I ASKED THEM IF I NEEDED TO CHANGE MY DRIVING HABITS IN ORDER FOR MY CAR TO WORK, AND THEY SAID \"HMM, YEAH\". REALLY??? TO TOP IT OFF, SINCE THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED DUE TO MY \"DRIVING HABITS\", I NEEDED TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BATTERY. I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OF THE OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM HAS PROBLEMS. NO CAR, ESPECIALLY NO HIGH END CAR, SHOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE \"IT IS NOT DRIVEN ENOUGH\". DID BMW ENGINEERS FINISHED THE DESIGN AND SAID, IT IS DONE, BUT IT WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU DRIVE IT ENOUGH!.

I HAVE DRIVEN MY CAR 12,000 A YEAR, EXCEEDING WHAT THEY RECOMMEND.  I HAVE ALSO HAD THIS VEHICLE IN FOUR TIMES TO FIX A DMTL PUMP PROBLEM.  BMW NORTH AMERICA SUGGESTED THAT THE BATTERY DRAIN HAS ALSO CAUSED THE DMTL PUMP NOT TO OPERATE PROPERLY.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE DMTL PUMP PROBLEM WAS A RESULT OF A LOOSE CONNECTION, THEN A GAS CAP LEAK, THEN THE VENT VALVE STICKING OPEN AND LASTLY SAID ON THE FOURTH ATTEMPT TO FIX IT THAT THE DMTL PUMP JUST DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND REPLACED IT.  WHAT IS IT???  I DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME ANSWERS FROM BMW NORTH AMERICA VERSUS THE DEALERSHIP.  I ALSO INVESTIGATED A WEB FORUM PERTAINING TO THIS ISSUE AND FOUND DOZENS OF OTHER BMW OWNERS WITH THE SAME \"HIGH BATTERY DRAIN\" PROBLEM.
