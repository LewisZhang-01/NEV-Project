THERE IS EVEN A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FILED WITH THE NHTSA THAT INSTRUCTS VW HOW TO REPLACE TO MASSIVE PROBLEM. I CONTACTED VW AND THEY WILL NOT HELP EVEN THOUGHT THIS IS A WIDELY REPORTED PROBLEM WITH 1999-2001 VWS AND A DESIGN DEFECT. NOW I NEED TO REPLACE THE WIRE HARNESS, WHICH APPARENTLY RUNS THROUGH MOST OF THE ENGINE AND CAR COMPONENTS AND MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER- A $3,800 REPAIR.
