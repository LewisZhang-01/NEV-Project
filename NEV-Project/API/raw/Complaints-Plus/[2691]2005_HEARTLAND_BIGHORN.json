ONE WAS DETERMINED BY ORIGINAL DEALER TO BE OUT-OF-ROUND, SECOND WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE CORD SEPARATION. BOTH ARE BEING REPLACED BY DEALER. BOTH TIRES HAD LESS THAN 11,000 MILES. PRESSURES WERE ALWAYS MAINTAINED AT 75 PSI. TRAILER WEIGHTS WERE VERIFIED AT BELOW RATED WEIGHT. SPEED NEVER EXCEEDED 60 MPH.  DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR EVENTS REPORTED TO NHTSA AS WELL AS ONLINE REPORTS ON VARIOUS WEB SITES, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENT TO INSURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY.  VEHICLE IS A 2005 GLENDALE TITANIUM MODEL 29E34TS. THIS IS INCLUDED AS IT IS NOT AN AVAILABLE OPTION IN THE LATER DESCRIPTION FIELDS.  *TR",
