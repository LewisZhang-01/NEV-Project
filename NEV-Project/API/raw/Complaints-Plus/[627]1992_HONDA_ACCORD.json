THESE TIRES HAVE A 35,000 MILE WARRANTY AND WE APPARENTLY HAVE USED THEM FOR 23,000 MILES.  THIS IS NTB'S STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE).  THESE ARE NOT FIRESTONE TIRES, BUT FORMULA GT TIRES (WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE THE MANUFACTURER OF THE TIRE).  WE ARE DISGUSTED WITH NTB.  THEY SHOW A COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR CONSUMER SAFETY.  THIS IS AMAZING IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH FIRESTONE.  THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED WE FOUGHT WITH THEM IN ORDER TO GET THE TIRES REPLACED WITHOUT COST.  OF COURSE, WE STILL HAD TO PAY FOR THE ALIGNMENT.  TODAY THEY WERE ABSURD.  MY HUSBAND TRIED TO CONTACT SEARS WHILE HE WAS IN NTB, BUT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT MERELY PLACED HIM BACK IN TOUCH WITH THE STORE MANAGER WHO MAINTAINED HIS POSITION.  MOST BUSINESS' WOULD RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AND TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMER WITHOUT QUESTION.  FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT, IT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO KEEP AN EXISTING CUSTOMER THAN TO ATTRACT A NEW ONE.  I'M SURE THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT SPENDS A LOT MORE THAN $100.00 TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO ITS STORES.  MY HUSBAND IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO REACH THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE MANUFACTURER OF THE TIRE.  WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING UNREASONABLE.  WE SIMPLY WANT THE DEFECTIVE TIRES REMOVED FROM THE CAR AND NEW TIRES OF EQUAL TO OR BETTER QUALITY PLACED ON THE CAR WITHOUT FURTHER COST TO OURSELVES.

HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTOR MAKES A GRINDING NOISE.  VEHICLE WILL SUDDENLY LOSE POWER OR STALL.  DEALER STATED THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THE DISTRIBUTOR HOUSING BEARING. A COSTLY REPAIR.  EVERYONE I KNOW THAT HAS AN OLDER ACCORD HAD THIS PROBLEM. MOST HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. WHY NO RECALL !!! I LOOKED UP OVER A HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE ALONE.   THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM. THE VEHICLE WILL SUDDENLY FAIL ON THE HIGHWAY AT ANY SPEED, COULD RESULT IN DEATH.  EVEN WRECKING YARDS ARE ASKING 150-180 DOLLARS FOR A USED DISTRIBUTOR HOUSING, DUE TO A HIGH DEMAND FOR THE 1991-1993 ACCORDS.

DISTRIBUTOR HOUSING SHOULD LAST AT LEAST 150,000-300,000 MILES.  UNABLE TO AFFORD REPAIR AND STUCK AT HOME. CAN'T EVEN PICK UP NEEDED MEDICATIONS. I TOOK VEHICLE TO DEALER WHEN I RECEIVED THE EXTENDED WARRENTY IN 1996, WOULDN'T REPLACE DIST HOUSING BECAUSE APPEARED NORMAL. NOW IS BAD AND WON'T FIX BECAUSE WARRENTIES ARE TOO RESTRICTIVE.
