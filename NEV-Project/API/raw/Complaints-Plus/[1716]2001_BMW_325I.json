        "summary": "I AM WRITING YOU REGARDING AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED WITH MY DAUGHTER'S 2001 BMW 325I. HER CAR HAS ABOUT 118,000 MILES ON IT.   RECENTLY IT DEVELOPED AN OIL LEAK SO MY WIFE TRADED CARS WITH HER ONE EVENING ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR FAVORITE MECHANIC.  I DISCUSSED THE SERVICES WE THOUGHT WERE NECESSARY WITH THE CAR WITH THE MECHANIC ' AN OIL LEAK, SOME INTERMITTENT MIS-FIRING AND ALSO THAT MY DAUGHTER HAD TOLD ME THAT RECENTLY SOMETIMES THE BRAKES WOULD COME ON WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING. I HAD ASKED HER WHAT SHE MEANT AND SHE SAID 'THE BRAKES WOULD GRAB WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING AND THAT IT MADE IT HARD TO STEER'. THE MECHANIC ASKED IF I THOUGHT SHE WAS INADVERTENTLY TAPPING THE BRAKES. I TOLD HIM NO, SHE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.   THE MECHANIC FOUND A LEAKING HEAD COVER GASKET AND CRANK SEAL THAT NEEDED REPLACEMENT. THE REPAIRS WERE ACCOMPLISHED FOR THESE ITEMS FIRST. THEN THE TECHNICIAN TEST DROVE THE CAR TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE BRAKES. HE RELATED TO ME THAT AT 60 MPH THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE GRABBED AND THEN RELEASED AS THE ABS SYSTEM TOOK OVER. THE CAR SWERVED DRASTICALLY TO THE LEFT AND THE TECHNICIAN ALMOST STRUCK THE CONCRETE BARRIER WALL ALONGSIDE AS HE CORRECTED THE STEERING. HE TOLD ME HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH A DRAMATIC LOSS OF CONTROL AND HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED NOR HEARD OF ANOTHER CAR BEHAVING IN THIS MANNER.    OUR MECHANIC AND HIS TECHNICIAN WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES WHICH LED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE YAW AND STEERING WHEEL SENSORS. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE SAN ANTONIO BMW DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR REQUIRED COMPUTER CODING AND RETURNED TO ME AS REPAIRED.  HAS THIS EVENT OCCURRED IN ANY OTHER CARS THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF? THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THERE IS AN ON-LINE NETWORK THAT MECHANICS CAN SHARE NOTES WITH THAT MENTIONS THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL INSTANCES.  *TR",
