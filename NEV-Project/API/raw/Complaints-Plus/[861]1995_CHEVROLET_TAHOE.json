THIS OCCURED SOME TIME AGO AND THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN IN FOR SERVICE ONE MONTH PRIOR SO I THOUGHT THE MECHANICS HAD OVER TIGHTENED IT. I REPLACED THE BATTERY AND + CABLE MYSELF; SO FAR SO GOOD. ON TO MY CHEIF COMPLAINT; APPROXIMATLY ONE WEEK AGO WHILE DRIVING I FELT A SNAP IN MY SEAT. I WROTE IT OFF AS A SPRING UNTIL I STOPPED, SUDDENLY MY DRIVERS SEAT HAD BECOME A ROCKING CHAIR. UPON RETURNING HOME I FOUND THAT THE SEAT WAS SECURED TO THE PEDASTAL VIA LESS THAN 1/8\" OF METAL. IT SEEMS GM IN ITS QUEST TO SAVE A BUCK NOT SO CLEVERLY FIGURED THAT THE STRESS IN NORMAL OPERATION ON A POWER SEAT IS NOT AS MUCH OF THAT IN A MANUAL SEAT. MY PROBLEM IS I PAYED MORE FOR A SEAT THAT POTENTIALLY PUTS MY FAMILY AND COUNTLESS OTHER PEOPLE IN LIFE THREATINING DANGER. WHAT GOOD IS A SAFETY BELT ON A SEAT THAT WILL NOT STAY CONNECTED TO YOUR VEHICLE IN A CRASH. I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUND THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT THE LATTER. I HAVE A PROBLEM BELEIVING THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO EGINEERED THIS MESS CAN GET AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION MOTOR TO RUN. CURRENTLY I AM AWAITING MY LOCAL GM SERVICE SHOP TO FIT ME IN SO THEY CAN SPARE 1 MEASLY MINUTE TO LOOK AT MY SEAT; THE CLOSEST APPOINTMENT WAS A WEEK AWAY. IN MY OPINION ANYTHING LESS THAN THEIR CURRENT SEATS WOULD BE UNACCIPTABLE. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I AM THE FIRST TO HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE INVESTIGATE.*AK",
