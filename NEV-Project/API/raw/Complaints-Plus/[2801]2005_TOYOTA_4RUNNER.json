TOYOTA ALREADY HAD TO RECALL ALL OF THEIR OTHER BODY-ON-FRAME VEHICLES (TACOMA, TUNDRA, SEQUOIA, AND LAND CRUISER) TO REPLACE THE FRAMES DUE TO RUST. WHY HAVE THEY NEGLECTED THE 4RUNNER WHEN IT'S ARGUABLY THE VEHICLE THAT WILL LIKELY SEE USE OFF ROAD MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS? THE NHTSA SHOULD FORCE TOYOTA TO RECALL THESE CARS BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED. LOOK AT ANY ONLINE FORUM AS I DID LAST NIGHT AND YOU'LL SEE TOYOTA IS ACTUALLY BEING SUED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS VERY ISSUE. TONS OF PEOPLE ARE SHARING PHOTOS AND STORIES OF THEIR OWN INCIDENTS.

THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE IS PRISTINE BUT I FEAR THAT THE PREMATURE RUSTING OF THE FRAME WILL AFFECT THE ABILITY TO SAFELY DRIVE MY 4RUNNER IN THE FUTURE.  I AM A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER WITH TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS AND DON'T HAVE THE INCOME TO GO OUT AND REPLACE THE FRAME OR BUY A NEW VEHICLE.  THIS 4RUNNER IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I OWN AND IS MY DAILY DRIVER.  MY STUDENTS AND THEIR GUARDIANS DEPEND ON ME TO ARRIVE SAFELY TO SCHOOL EVERYDAY SO THERE IS CONSISTENCY IN MY STUDENTS' LIVES.  I HAVE SEEN MANY 4RUNNERS IN THIS AGE RANGE SUFFER FROM THIS SAME CORROSION.  I AM CONCERNED THAT MY FAMILY WILL BE INJURED IN A MINOR ACCIDENT OR THE VEHICLE'S SAFETY MECHANISMS FAILING BECAUSE OF FRAME DAMAGE.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT I WILL LOSE MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTING MYSELF TO WORK.  I AM A HUGE FAN OF TOYOTA, ESPECIALLY 4RUNNERS, AND WANT TO KEEP MINE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME.

I AM THE THIRD OWNER OF THE TRUCK AND KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND SERVICED.  WEEKS AFTER PURCHASING THE TRUCK, EXITING THE HIGHWAY, THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED. PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, NO PRESSURE. I WAS ABLE TO COAST THE CAR TO A NEARBY PARKING LOT AND HAD IT TOWED TO MY MECHANIC. UPON INSPECTION, MY MECHANIC NOTED THAT THE FRAME WAS SEVERELY RUSTED. THE BRAKE LINES HAD FAILED AS A RESULT OF THE CORROSION AND RUST ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE. I REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM AT A COST OF $3500.00.  A MONTH LATER, THE TRUCK FAILED INSPECTION DUE TO A HOLE IN THE SUBFRAME CAUSED BY THE RUST. IT WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN RESEARCH AND LEARNED OF THE TOYOTA RECALL FOR EVERY OTHER TRUCK EXCEPT THE 4RUNNER IN SIMILAR YEARS/GENERATION.   I TOOK THE TRUCK TO BURDICK TOYOTA IN CICERO, NEW YORK THIS SEPTEMBER TO HAVE THE FRAME INSPECTED. THE TECH REPORT (WHICH I CAN FURNISH ON REQUEST) STATED THAT THE FRAME WAS EXTREMELY RUSTED, SCALED AND DETERIORATED FOR THE AGE OF THE VEHICLE, BUT THAT IT POSED NO IMMINENT THREAT. I DISAGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT, AS IT HAS ALREADY CAUSED ONE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  I'VE LEARNED OF A POTENTIAL INVESTIGATION AND MUST SAY, I BELIEVE IT TO BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NHTSA TO RECALL THE AFFECTED 4RUNNERS OF THE SAME GENERATION.   HAD THE SCENARIO BEEN DIFFERENT, I OR MY FAMILY COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.   I'M A TEACHER, AND HAVEN'T THE MEANS TO SIMPLY REPLACE A VEHICLE I'VE ALREADY HAD TO PUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO. I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SAFETY OF MY BRAND NEW BABY GIRL.   I FEEL IT MORALLY IMPERATIVE THAT THE NHTSA DO THE RIGHT THING AND RECALL THE 4RUNNERS AS THEY HAVE THE OTHER VEHICLES. HUMAN LIFE SHOULD ALWAYS BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A COMPANIES BOTTOM LINE.

EVEN WITHOUT COLLISION I'M WORRIED AN AXLE OR TIE ROD OR SOMETHING WILL BREAK AT HIGH SPEED AND CAUSE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. I'VE SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ASK IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY WOULD DO (FIX, OR BUY BACK THE VEHICLE). THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECALL FOR TOYOTA 4RUNNER FRAMES, BUT THERE IS AN ACTIVE RECALL FOR FRAME RUST ON THE TACOMA, WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SAME FRAME. AFTER LOOKING AROUND ONLINE AT 4RUNNER FORUMS, I'VE SEEN THE RUST COMPLAINT AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND IN THE WAKE OF THE KOBE METALS SCANDAL, I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO RAISE MY CONCERN WITH THE NHTSA.

I JUST DROVE IT A WEEK AGO AND THAT WAS NOT THERE. I HAVE NEVER USED ANY CHEMICALS ON MY DASH, ONLY A DAMP CLOTH.  AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS A FACTORY SEAM. I PULLED IT OUT OF THE GARAGE AND INTO THE SUNLIGHT WHERE I COULD SEE IT BETTER AND SURE ENOUGH YOU COULD SEE THE YELLOW FOAM INSIDE THE CRACK. I WENT TO GOOGLE THE PROBLEM AND COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES AT ALL THE SAME, EXACT PROBLEMS THAT WERE GOING ON. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS WITH THE 4RUNNER'S DASH CRACKING FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN TOYOTA WITH THE QUALITY OF MATERIALS THAT THEY USED TO MAKE THIS DASH PAD. MY VEHICLE IS IN MINT CONDITION AND HAS BEEN GARAGE KEPT IT'S ENTIRE LIFE.THIS SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING MOSTLY TO THE 2003-2005 4RUNNER'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I HAVE READ THAT OTHER OWNER'S HAVE CONTACTED THEIR DEALERSHIP AND TOYOTA MOTOR SALES USA, INC. ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE ALL REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THIS NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED BY TOYOTA BECAUSE I HAVE NOTICED THE CRACK IS GETTING BIGGER WHEN IT EXPANDS IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN. THE DASH PAD GOES DIRECTLY OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG AND IF THE CRACKING CONTINUES IT COULD MAKE THE AIRBAG MALFUNCTION AND DEPLOY UNEXPECTEDLY. I HAVE READ OTHER 4RUNNER OWNER'S ARE VERY WORRIED THAT THE CRACKING DASH WILL EFFECT THE AIRBAG TOO.TOYOTA COULD AT LEAST PAY HALF FOR THE PART AND LET A TOYOTA TECH INSTALL IT.  *TR",

I NOTIFIED BOTH THE LOCAL DEALER AND THE MAIN TOYOTA OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA, THEY MADE AN OFFER TO REPLACE THE DASHBOARD BUT I WOULD HAVE TO COVER MORE THAN HALF OF THE COST.  THEY DID NOT ADMIT TO ANY PROBLEM THAT TOYOTA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  I WAS INFORMED THOUGH THAT TOYOTA USED RECYCLED PLASTICS IN THE MANUFACTURER OF SOME OF THE INTERIOR PARTS.  AT THAT POINT,  BEING UNEDUCATED IN THE USE OF RECYCLED PLASTICS I BEGAN TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND, THIS IS WHAT I FOUND;  TOYOTA HAS USED RECYCLED PLASTICS FOR THE MANUFACTURER OF ITS AUTOMOBILE AND TRUCK PARTS FOR SOMETIME AND ARE CONSIDERED EXPERTS IN THE RECYCLING FIELD.   I ALSO FOUND THAT DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WE HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECYCLED PLASTICS BEING USED \"VIRGIN, RECYCLED AND DEGRADABLE.\"  THIS HAS PRESENTED A PROBLEM OF WHICH MY TOYOTA 4RUNNER IS A VICTIM, THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN.  THE USERS OF RECYCLED PLASTICS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF LONG LIFE SPAN PRODUCTS (MY DASHBOARD) HAS TO BE SURE THAT DEGRADABLE (SHORT LIFE SPAN) PLASTICS FEEDSTOCKS DO NOT GET MIXED IN TOGETHER.  WHAT YOU HAVE IF YOU ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IS A DASHBOARD THAT DISINTEGRATES BEFORE ITS TIME, LIKE A BOTTLE MADE TO BE DISPOSED OF IN A LANDFILL.

WE ACTUALLY BACKED INTO A GROVE OF SMALL TREES AND SHRUBS WHICH CAUGHT US.  THE CAR WAS SCRATCHED UP A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH DAMAGE WAS DONE.  I DID CALL THE POLICE AND MADE A REPORT.  MY YOUNGER SISTER WAS WITH ME.  THE BACKWARDS ACCELERATION WAS SMOOTH AND DID NOT KNOCK US AROUND MUCH AND THE STOP WAS KIND OF SMOOTH.  AFTER I TURNED IT OFF I COULD NOT USE THE BRAKES ANYMORE BUT AT LEAST WE STOPPED.  IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR ANY MORE.  IT IS PARKED AT MY HOUSE.  FIRST I RENTED A CAR AND NOW HAVE BORROWED ONE FROM A RELATIVE.  I CALLED CORPORATE TOYOTA AND AN ENGINEER FROM EAA IS COMING TO BRUNSWICK TOYOTA TOMORROW (08/26) TO CHECK OUT THE CAR.  TOYOTA OFFERED NO HELP WITH ANOTHER CAR AND SAY IT WILL TAKE UP TO 30 DAYS TO GIVE ME THE RESULTS OF THE INSPECTION TOMORROW.  MEANWHILE I CAN'T DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE I AM AFRAID OF IT AND I CAN'T TRADE IT IN SO I AM STUCK.  THE CAR WAS ALMOST PAID OFF AND HAS NEVER GIVEN ME ANY TROUBLE TO SPEAK OF UNTIL THIS HAPPENED.  I NEVER SUSPECTED MY CAR SINCE I HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY 4RUNNERS HAVING A PROBLEM.  I AM AN HONEST PERSON AND AM WELL RESPECTED IN MY COMMUNITY.  I WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE TOYOTA WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  I FEEL THAT THE LEAST THAT TOYOTA COULD DO IS GIVE ME BACK THE $25,000 THAT I PAID FOR THE CAR.

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2008, I NOTIFIED TOYOTA COMPANY BY TELEPHONE OF THE INCIDENT HISTORY; I WAS GIVEN A CASE NUMBER. I COMPLIED WITH A DIRECTIVE TO REMOVE AFTER MARKET FLOOR MATS THAT COVERED THE FACTORY MATS. FYI, THE AFTER MARKET NON-FACTORY FLOOR MATS WERE NOT INTERFERING WITH OR NEAR THE ACCELERATOR, AND I HAVE HAD FURTHER UNINTENDED ACCELERATION SUBSEQUENT TO MAT REMOVAL.

I WORKED OVER 37 YEARS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY ON CONTROL SYSTEMS USING PROCESSORS SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN AUTOMOBILES. I AM AWAITING THE PROBLEM TO HAPPEN AGAIN, AND WHEN IT DOES I'M GOING TO KEEP FILING THESE COMPLAINTS. THANK YOU *TR",
