I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE TECH THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS CAR AND IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW.  HE SAID THAT LAND ROVER IS FULLY AWARE OF THE ISSUE BUT THERE IS NO RECALL AT THIS TIME AS THEY DIDN'T SEE IT AS A SAFETY CONCERN.  HOW CAN THIS BE?  IF DRIVEN IN THIS CONDITION, IT WILL LOCK UP AT SOME POINT AND THERE YOU WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD OR FREEWAY!  NOTE THAT THERE IS ALSO A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT DETAILING THE REPAIR.  HE DID STATE THAT THE NEW REAR DIFFERENTIAL IS AN IMPROVED DESIGN?  ONE OF THE SITES DETAILING THIS ISSUE IS WWW.LANDROVERSONLY.COM.",

AFTER THAT; ALL 4 TIRES WERE REPLACED WITH A FULL ALIGNMENT, NOTHING SEEMED TO HELP THE NOISES AT ALL. AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH OF THIS PROBLEM; IT SEEMS THERE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THE REAR END DIFFERENTIAL ON THIS MAKE/MODEL VEHICLE FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS, THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS HIGHLY AWARE OF. I'M A MOTHER OF SMALL CHILDREN AND MY MAIN CONCERN IS THEIR SAFETY IN THIS MATTER; IF THIS PROBLEM IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, IT COULD END UP WITH THE REAR WHEELS LOCKING UP.
