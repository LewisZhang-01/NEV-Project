YOU SURELY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM YOUR 4 CYL. ENGINES HAVE HAD WITH FAILING HEAD   GASKETS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS THE SECOND ONE EXPERIENCING SUCH FAILURE. I REPLACED THE ORIGINAL ONE SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MY OWN EXPENSE.     LET ME STATE MY UNQUALIFIED CASE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THIS REPLACEMENT, AS YOU--SUBARU--KNEW WELL THAT GASKET FAILURE WAS IN THIS CAR'S FUTURE. HOW DO I MAKE THIS CLAIM? WELL, WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR, IT CAME WITH AN ADDITIVE IN THE RADIATOR. SOMETHING YOU CALL \"COOLANT CONDITIONER.\" NOBODY TOLD ME WHY THIS WAS NECESSARY. I FOUND OUT ONE DAY WHEN MY TEMPERATURE GAUGE RED-LINED AND MY RADIATOR RAN DRY.     I QUICKLY MADE MY WAY TO THE NEAREST SUBARU DEALERSHIP SO, RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM, THE MECHANIC THERE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS COOLANT CONDITIONER AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN MY FORESTER THE DAY I DROVE IT FROM THE DEALERSHIP. HE SOLD ME ANOTHER BOTTLEAND ADVISED ME TO POUR IT INTO THE RADIATOR IMMEDIATELY.    I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE PROBLEM, AND I DROVE ANOTHER, SAY 30,000 OR SO CARE-FREE MILES, UNTIL THE GASKET AGAIN BROKE DOWN. TIME FOR A REPLACEMENT, MY PERSONAL MECHANIC ADVISED ME. I RELENTED AND DROVE ABOUT 40,000 MILES ON THE NEW GASKET...UNTIL EXPERIENCING FAILURE AGAIN.    AS I INDICATED BEFORE, FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT, YOU--SUBARU--MUST HAVE KNOWN IT HAD A BIG PROBLEM ON ITS HANDS. WHY YOU FAILED TO INITIATE A RECALL AND WERE NEVER CALLED TO TASK FOR IT IS A MYSTERY TO ME. RECALL WHAT HAPPENED TO VOLKSWAGEN  ONLY A FEW YEARS BACK. THEY KNEW ABOUT THEIR \"PROBLEM\" AS WELL.

I HAVE SINCE HAD THE COOLING SYSTEM PROBLEM REPAIRED AT MY            OWN EXPENSE.    NOTE ALSO: I SEE WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT ENTRY FOR PENDING DEALER REPAIRS ON A HONDA CIVIC (I THINK)                     PERTAINING TO \"COOLANT LOSS\". AT LEAST HONDA COMPANY WILL LIVE UP TO AND CORRECT ITS                   MANUFACTURING MISTAKES.    I AND OTHERS HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THEIR SUBARU VEHICLES CIRCA 1997-2004. THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM LOSING COOLANT AT AN UNACCEPTABLE RATE. THIS IS THE RESULT OF FUNCTIONAL DESIGN FLAWS OF USING DIFFERENT METALS IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THIS ALLOWS LARGER THAN NORMAL GAPS TO OPEN UP IN THE CYLINDER WALLS AS THE TWO METALS EXPAND DIFFERENTLY WHEN THE ENGINE HEATS UP. COUPLED WITH CHEAP GASKETS, THIS FORMULA HAS LED TO MANY ENGINE SEIZURES IN THESE CARS ACROSS THE COUNTRY DUE TO OVERHEATING. (I'VE CAUGHT MINE BARELY IN TIME AS THE THERMOSTAT HIT RED-LINE TWICE NOW WITHOUT WARNING.) MEANWHILE, SUBARU KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FROM THE ONSET, SINCE DEALERS TREATED THE COOLANT SYSTEM WITH SO-CALLED COOLANT \"CONDITIONER\" BEFORE SELLING THESE CARS. AND THEY DIDN'T ADVISE THE PURCHASER THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS AND WHY. PROBLEMS IS...THE CONDITIONER WILL NOT WORK INDEFINITELY AND MAY EVEN ACCELERATE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CHEAP GASKET. I'VE GOT 81,400 MILES NOW ON MY CAR AND I'M ON MY SECOND CAN OF CONDITIONER. BUT THE COOLANT LEVEL KEEPS DROPPING AND IT'S BURNING AWAY IN THE HOT ENGINE. I CAN SMELL IT WHEN I LEAVE THE CAR IN THE GARAGE OVERNIGHT. (IT SMELLS SWEET BUT I'M NOT TOO PLEASED WITH IT.). SUBARU HAS SINCE HAD THE FORETHOUGHT TO CHANGE ITS GASKETS TO MUCH STURDIER ONES. BUT, OF COURSE, THAT MEANS I'D HAVE TO SHELL OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPLACE MINE.  *TR",

AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH (SEE NHTSA COMPLAINTS), THIS APPEARS TO BE A CHRONIC PROBLEM WITH THESE ENGINES. I CONTINUED TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND ADD OIL AS NECESSARY. I SEEM TO NEED 1 QUART PER 1500 MILES, APPROXIMATELY.    NOW, THE FINAL PROBLEM. ON 3/24/04, AT 77,848, I WAS DRIVING AT 65 MPH, HEARD A STRANGE NOISE AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND COASTED TO A SAFE TURN OUT.  AFTER TOWING THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC, HE DISCOVERED THAT THE TOP OF THE TIMING BELT TENSIONER HAD POPPED OFF, RELEASING THE HYDRAULIC AND OF COURSE THE TIMING BELT. HE HAS NEVER SEEN A TENSIONER FAIL, AND OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF NEW TIMING BELTS HE HAS DONE, HE ONLY HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT A DOZEN THAT WERE OUT OF SPECS. WE DEBATED A COURSE OF ACTION AND, SINCE IT IS A NON-INTERFERENCE MOTOR, I DECIDED TO REPLACE THE TENSIONER AND NOT THE ENTIRE MOTOR. HE ALSO DID A HAND CRANK TO CHECK FOR RESISTANCE OR OTHER HEAD DAMAGE. AFTER WAITING NEARLY 2 WEEKS FOR PARTS (DUE TO SUBARU'S PART ORDERING METHOD), HE REPLACED THE TENSIONER. WHEN TESTING THE ENGINE, IT DID NOT SOUND RIGHT. HE DID A COMPRESSION TEST AND FOUND NO COMPRESSION ON 3 CYLINDERS! SO NOW I HAD THE SHOCKING PROSPECT  OF NEEDING A NEW ENGINE!I DECIDED I BETTER GET HELP FROM THE DEALER, AS THIS ALL APPEARS TO BE A QUALITY ISSUE THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING TO THIS ENGINE AT THIS MILEAGE. THE CAR IS NOW AT STOHLMAN SUBARU IN VIENNA, VA.  *AK",

AUGUST 13, 2001:  RIGHT REAR BEARINGS WENT OUT AGAIN ON CITY STREETS NEAR HOME.  MY SON TOOK THE CAR TO STEVENS CREEK SUBARU.  THEY TOLD ME WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR ON 8/15 THAT FORESTERS OF ALL YEARS HAVE THIS RECURRING PROBLEM.  FURTHER, ONCE A CAR HAS THE PROBLEM, IT WILL CONTINUE TO RECUR.  THE WARRANTY COVERED ALL COSTS.   LESS THAN ONE WEEK LATER, 8/20, THE BEARINGS WENT OUT AGAIN.  THIS TIME WE WERE ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD GOING AROUND A LEFT BEND WHEN THEY BROKE.  I NEARLY LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AS IT STARTED TO SLIDE TOWARDS THE CLIFF, BUT MANAGED TO GET IT TO A SMALL TURNOUT SAFELY.   THE SERVICE MANAGER AT 49ER SUBARU IN ANGELS CAMP, CA, TOLD ME THAT THE AXLE \"EXPLODED\" AS A RESULT OF THE BEARINGS GOING OUT, WHICH IS WHY THE CAR HAD STARTED TO SLIDE.  THEY USED ALL FORESTER PARTS TO REPLACE THE BROKEN ONES, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THEY USED LEGACY BEARINGS INSTEAD OF FORESTER BEARINGS.  THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A FACTORY APPROVED CHANGE, BUT THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE A TSB OR ANYTHING IN WRITING STATING THAT THIS WAS AN APPROVED SUBSTITUTION.  SUBARU PAID FOR ALL REPAIRS AND THE HOTEL, AND THEY EXTENDED MY WARRANTY TO 6 YEARS 100,000 MILES.  DENE WITT, SUBARU CENTRAL REGION OFFICE, 15000 E. 39TH AVE, AURORA, CO 80011 WAS VERY HELPFUL AND KIND THROUGHOUT THIS ORDEAL AND WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO MAKE SURE WE GOT BACK ON THE ROAD QUICKLY (SHE HAD TO HAVE AN AXLE OVERNIGHTED FROM OUT OF STATE).
