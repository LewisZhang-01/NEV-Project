I also experienced a lack of power and was concerned for the vehicle to stall out while in traffic.   The dealership informed me this is an issue with the 2021 GMC Sierra with a 5.3L V8 engine. I had seen online that GMC issued a service bulletin to have the lifters replaced in the 2021 GMC Sierra that were on the lot before they were sold (early December 2021). If this is a known issue why weren't the lifters replaced in vehicles on the road before the ones sitting on the lot.  8 lifters were replaced by the dealership but there was a shortage of parts due to the nationwide problem.   There were no warning lamps, messages prior to the failure. The only symptoms I had was shaking and lack of power as indicated above after the autostop feature was activated.

We had it towed to a dealer in Frankenmuth MI. Our truck has 11,800 miles . It has a diagnostics report of Valve lifter defects left bank. Starter had to be replaced.  And now gm wants to only fix to affected bank . But on the unsold trucks they will repair both banks as stated in service bulletin N212353840 . If we have one bad lifter they should all be replaced as for this not to happen again.

The noise was off and on at first and then remained constant. Fortunataly I was able to make it safely back to my residents. I parked the vehicle and did a scan code and it did not have any codes, I did a pending code scan and it had a P0300 code. I started the engine and the noise was louder at first and then got quiter after about 15 seconds of running the check enging light came on I shut the engine down and did another scan it gave me a P0302 code. I feel that the vehicle is unsafe to drive and could cause a accident if it locks up on the highway. I contacted GM and reported the issue, they said take it to a near by GM dealer, I told them that I felt the vehicle was unsafe to drive and they tried to contact me with road side assistance but I was unable to get anyone on the phone.

Oil pressure and cooling temps were as they should be. The next day on the way to the dealership the engine started knocking. This time the check engine light came on, speed was greatly reduced at this time. After about five miles the knocking stopped and the check engine light went out.    The Dealership checked it out and stated the lifters were bad. It seems that this is a known issue with GM. I was told by the Dealership that there were two other trucks ahead of me with the same issue. Also, because this is such a prevalent issue with GM, they cannot keep up with the demand for parts. My Dealership is waiting for a head gasket. GM has known about the faulty parts for approximately two years, and they are only replacing some of the faulty, poorly made parts, hoping the other side of the engine will not develop issues and fail.
