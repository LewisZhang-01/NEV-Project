WE WERE ON A TRIP, BUT WE TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE NEAREST NISSAN DEALER (NOT THE DEALER WHO SOLD ME THE TRUCK).

TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEALER WENT ON A 10 MINUTE DRIVE WITH MY WIFE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  THE LIGHT STAYED ON FOR THE ENTIRE TEST DRIVE, MEANING THAT THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN A FRONTAL COLLISION.  THIS IS DOCUMENTED ON THE INVOICE I RECEIVED FROM THE DEALER.    IN 2016, NHTSA REQUIRED A RECALL (16V244000) OF 3.53 MILLION NISSAN AND INFINITY CARS FOR EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM.  NHTSA NOTES THAT \"THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MAY INCORRECTLY CLASSIFY AN ADULT PASSENGER AS A CHILD OR CLASSIFY THE SEAT AS EMPTY DESPITE IT BEING OCCUPIED.\"  FOR SOME REASON, THE FRONTIER MODEL WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.   I HAVE INFORMED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED ANY HELP.
