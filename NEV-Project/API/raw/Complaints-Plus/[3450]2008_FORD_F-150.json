IT GOT TO A POINT THAT WHEN MAKING A TURN THE WHEEL WOULD NOT RECOVER AND ACTUALLY HAD TO BE PULLED BACK MAKING IT DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  I TOOK IT TO MY SERVICE SHOP AND THEY REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP WHICH DID NOTHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  I THEN DID SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE AND FOUND VARIOUS FORUMS WHERE OWNERS AND REPAIR TECHS DESCRIBED THE TWO \"U\" JOINTS ON THE F-150 STEERING SHAFT BECOMING BADLY CORRODED MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND POINTING OUT THE JOINTS HAVE NO GREASE FITTING.  I CHECKED THE JOINTS ON MY TRUCK AND THEY ERE CORRODED.  I APPLIED LUBRICANT EXTERNALLY AND IT COMPLETELY ELIMINATED MY PROBLEM, HOWEVER, I HAVE TO REAPPLY LUBRICANT EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.  THE ATTACHED PHOTO SHOWS THE UPPER JOINT AFTER I LUBRICATED IT.  FORD HAS TO KNOW THIS SAFETY ISSUE EXISTS AND THAT THIS IS COSTING OWNERS NEEDLESS REPAIR COSTS.",

UPON ALL THREE IMPACTS THE SEAT BELTS DID NOT LOCK NOR DID ANY AIR BAGS DEPLOY CAUSING MY GIRLFRIEND TO HIT THE WINDSHIELD AND I STRUCK THE STEERING WHEEL WITH MY CHEST AND CHIN. WHEN THE FIRE DEPT. ARRIVED, THEY CUT TALL BATTERY CABLE TO PREVENT THE AIR BAGS GOING OFF ACCIDENTALLY WHILE WE WERE BEING REMOVED FROM THE TRUCK. NO TICKETS WERE ISSUED TO MYSELF OR THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK THAT HIT ME. THE TRUCK WAS TOTALLED AS THE FRAME WAS TWISTED AND TOTAL FRONT END WAS DESTROYED. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH FORD DIRECTLY. I SENT THEM PICTURES AND INFORMATION THEY ASKED FOR. THEY ARE REQUESTING INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO THE TRUCK THAT I CANNOT PROVIDE AS MY INSURANCE COMPANY TOOK POSSESION OF THE VEHICLE. TO THIS DAY FORD ONLY SENDS ME LETTERS ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. THE PICTURES I SENT TO FORD SHOWED EVERY ANGLE OF THE FRONT END DAMAGE AS WELL AS PICTURES OF THE INSIDE CLEARLY SHOWING THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT SINCE I'M THE AVERAGE PERSON STRUGGLING TO MAKE A LIVING AND FORD IS THE BIG CORPORATION WITH BOTTOMLESS POCKETS THAT NOTHING WILL BE DONE OR HAS BEEN DONE. THIS IS CLEARLY A CASE OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT WHICH I SENT PROOF WITH THE PICTURES. BIG BROTHER STICKS IT TO THE AVERAGE PERSON AGAIN WITH NO CONSEQUENCES!!!  *TR",

PREPARING TO TURN AT INTERSECTION, SPEED ABOUT 10 MPH, WHEN ENGINE STARTED TO ROAR. FIRST REFLEX WAS TO PRESS BRAKE WHICH CAUSED THE TIRES TO SQUEAL.

MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER BOTH DRIVE THIS VEHICLE OCCASIONALLY, I AM AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT GET IT INTO NEUTRAL SOON ENOUGH TO KEEP FROM CAUSING INJURY TO A PERSON OR ANYTHING IN THE PATH.    07/18/2012: REPAIR CONSISTED OF CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH. WITH OUT THE ENGINE LIGHT BEING ON, THEY JUST HAD TO GUESS AS TO WHAT REPAIR TO DO.THE SHOP MANAGER SAID IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE AND DRIVE IT TO SEE IF THIS PROBLEM WOULD RECUR. THIS WOULD CAUSE US NOT TO HAVE USE OF THE VEHICLE FOR POSSIBLY MONTHS. VEHICLE FUNCTIONED FINE UNTIL 05/29/2013.

WE PULLED OVER AND WAITED FOR A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE OUR CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS EXAMINED TODAY.  WE LEARNED THAT THIS COMMON ISSUE IN FORD F150 TRUCKS WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $1000 (LOW END) TO $3500 (HIGH END) TO FIX.  A SPARK PLUG SIMPLY \"POPPED OUT\", TEARING UP THE THREADS IN THE CYLINDER, CAUSING THE DEALER TO RECOMMEND CYLINDER HEAD REPLACEMENT. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAN BE A LESS EXPENSIVE FIX TO THE PROBLEM, BUT FORD DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT FIX. MY VEHICLE IS 3 YEARS OLD AND HAS 70K MILES ON IT. WE ARE VERY METICULOUS ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE ON OUR VEHICLE AND AS THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED, THIS IS A DEFECT IN THIS ENGINE DESIGN AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM. THEY RECOMMEND A TUNE UP TO REPLACE ALL SPARK PLUGS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AND I DO NOT HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. AFTER DRIVING MY LAST FORD F150 FOR 200K MILES WITH NO ISSUES, I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING $4,000 WHEN IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE ON A VEHICLE THAT I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THAT IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD.  *TT",

THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.   THE ENGINE WAS REVVING UP AS I WAS APPLYING THE BRAKE, SO I APPLIED THE BRAKE HARDER AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV HIGHER UNTIL THE TRUCK LURCHED FORWARD.  THIS CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE AND MY FOOT CAME OFF THE BRAKE AND THE ENGINE REVVED DOWN.  I REALIZED THAT MY FOOT HAD BEEN ON THE ACCELERATOR THE SAME TIME IT WAS ON THE BRAKE.  SINCE THAT FIRST TIME, I KNOW THAT IF THE ENGINE STARTS REVVING WHILE I AM APPLYING THE BRAKE THAT I HAVE MY FOOT ON BOTH AND CAN ANGLE MY FOOT TO THE LEFT TO REMOVE IT FROM THE ACCELERATOR WHILE STILL KEEPING MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  EVEN SO, ONE TIME I JUST MISSED HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WHILE \"STOPPING\".  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE A DANGEROUS DESIGN.  WHEN THE ENGINE BEGINS REVVING FOR \"NO APPARENT  REASON\" ONE TENDS TO PANIC AND STEPS HARDER ON THE BRAKE  WHICH MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE.  I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

BUT I HAVE BACKED UP MANY OTHER PICKUP TRUCKS IN THE PAST TO HOOK UP BOAT TRAILERS AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE.

THIS FUEL ODOR ORIGINATES IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND COMES INTO THE CAB THROUGH THE A/C VENTS. THIS GAS ODOR HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY A SERVICE TECHNICIAN, THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND THE SERVICE MANAGER. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE IN 4 TIMES (8/12/08, 8/15/08, 9/2/08, AND 9/11/08) DURING THESE REPAIR ATTEMPTS I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THE VEHICLE FOR WELL OVER 30 DAYS.  THIS PROBLEM CREATES A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD; I AM CONCERNED THAT THE FUEL VAPORS WILL CAUSE A FIRE AND EXPLOSION.  *TR",

YESTERDAY 4/29/08 I WAS PREPARING TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT FROM A TWO LANE HIGHWAY AND THE TRUCK SPONTANEOUSLY ACCELERATED AT FULL THROTTLE WITH MY FOOT FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE. I HAD THE SENSATION THAT I WAS HIT FROM BEHIND BECAUSE I WAS ADVANCING WITHOUT APPLYING THE ACCELERATOR. WITH THE BRAKES FULLY APPLIED I CONTINUED TO ADVANCE INTO THE PARKING LOT AND I IMMEDIATELY SHIFTED INTO PARK IN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AND THE ENGINE WAS RACING AT FULL THROTTLE IN PARK, I THEN TURNED THE IGNITION OFF AND THE ENGINE STOPPED. FROM THE TIME I EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION OF BEING HIT FROM BEHIND UNTIL THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST, I ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE OF TRAVEL AT 50 FEET. THERE WERE TWO PASSENGERS IN THE TRUCK WITH ME THAT WITNESSED THE EVENT AND CONCURRED THAT THE TRUCK HAD ACCELERATED SPONTANEOUSLY. I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER, EXPLAINED THE EXPERIENCE AND AFTER CHECKING IT OUT INFORMED ME THAT NO PROBLEM COULD BE FOUND. I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.  *TR",

AFTER I LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL THE TRUCK WILL THEN SLAM INTO GEAR.  I HAVE TAKEN MY FORD BACK TO THE DEALER TWO TIMES TO HAVE IT FIXED AND THEY SAY THEY CAN NOT FIX IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.  THEY TOLD ME TO DRIVE IT UNTIL IT GETS WORSE AND THEN BRING IT BACK.  I DID NOT REALIZE JUST HOW MUCH DANGER THEY WERE PUTTING ME IN UNTIL APRIL 1, 2008 BECAUSE THE TRUCK HAD NOT EVER SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL WHILE I WAS COASTING AROUND AN OFF RAMP AND ATTEMPTING TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC.

I HAVE REPORTED IT TO FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS CENTER AND THEY SAY THEY CAN NOT FIX IT UNTIL IT HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY AND THEN THEY CAN DUPLICATE THE OCCURRENCE.

INSTEAD OF   SLOWING THE VEHICLE WHEN THE BRAKE WAS GENTLY APPLIED,   THE VEHICLE ACTED LIKE IT WAS ON A SHEET OF ICE.  I COULD   \"FEEL\" THE ABS BRAKES TRYING TO STOP THE VEHICLE, BUT IT   SEEMED TO BE ACCELERATING ON IT'S OWN.  I BARELY MISSED   THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME AND A LIGHT POLE NEAR THE EDGE   OF THE ROAD, SINCE I HAD TO STEER OFF OF THE ROAD AND ONTO   THE SIDEWALK AREA WHERE I IMMEDIATELY PUT THE TRANSMISSION   INTO NEUTRAL AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  I CALLED THE   DEALERSHIP AND THEY SENT A MECHANIC WHO RETURNED THE   VEHICLE TO THE SERVICE AREA AND CHECKED ALL OF THE SYSTEMS.    THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS FOUND AND THAT I   MUST HAVE APPLIED THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR AT THE SAME TIME.    I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT DO THAT.  I TRIED TO APPLY THE BRAKE AND   ACCELERATOR SIMULTANEOUSLY AFTER RETURNING HOME, AND IT IS POSSIBLE,   BUT VERY DIFFICULT AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO DO.
