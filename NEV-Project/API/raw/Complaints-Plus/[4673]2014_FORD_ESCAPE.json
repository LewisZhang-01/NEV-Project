I stopped the car on a bit of a diagonal in the middle of the street in order to get out and quickly hand something off to someone there.  I put the car in park and stepped out for maybe 30 seconds without even closing my door. Then when I got back in and tried to drive the car I had no ability to shift into any gear. The gear shifting didn\u2019t click in in any way. The car didn\u2019t register as in park. No lights highlighted the gear on the dashboard. The 4 tires were locked but the steering wheel moved freely and everything else in the car seemed to be perfectly fine. No warning lights came on. We turned the car off and back on many times hoping the computer system would resolve the issue - but that never changed the situation. I could not drive this car. I could not move the car. I was blocking other cars. I called AAA which took an hour and a half to get to me. I had AAA put the car on a flat bed truck and bring it to my Darien CT driveway ( at great expense) and then the next morning spoke with my Ford dealership and had AAA move the car to the dealership  While now having to take a subway and a train to get back to Darien I looked up what could be wrong and discovered there had been a recall of many 2014 Escapes in 2018 to replace a faulty bushing which could detach from the transmission cable and make it impossible to control the gears. MY ESCAPE WAS NOT RECALLED - BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN because that is exactly what happened. This was very dangerous and expensive. I\u2019m extremely disturbed that had my Escape been fixed in this recall this then would not have happened to me. And my life would not have been in jeopardy. What if this happened minutes later when I was again driving in NYCity or on the highway ?  The Ford dealership in Stamford CT discovered that \u201cthe shifter cable bushing on transmission is broken and not connected to transmission\u2026\u201d",

The dealerships only replaced the engine coolant sensors & the motor mounts per their understanding of the recall instructions but did not replace the coolant system hoses as instructed in the Dec 13th correspondence to the dealers. After having several problems with coolant leakages in my vehicle which caused the check engine light to come on it was discovered that I had multiple hoses leaking. I spoke with a service manager at the dealership that performed my recall service in April/2018 about the hoses not being replaced which was my current problem? I was informed this was not what the dealerships were instructed to do by Ford Motors in their recall notices to them. Two different dealerships I visited were oblivious to this recall mandate. In the meantime I have incurred nearly $1500 in repair expenses because the recall that was investigated and mandated by NHTSA in 2017 was not performed in its entirety although Ford Motors assured this would be addressed in the recall.

My car was struggling to shift from neutral to reverse and was making a loud revving noise even when idle. I was almost read-ended when my transmission went out and caused others to change lanes quickly to avoid hitting me. I was lucky that I did not get stranded in the middle lane of the highway. I had my vehicle towed to AAMCO who confirmed it was my transmission. The service representative I spoke to said that he drove my car around the block himself and got stranded in the middle of the road. He confirmed my transmission was reading multiple error codes and that it would need to be rebuilt. It is still currently being repaired, but they estimated it would be around $3300 to rebuild the transmission. There was no check engine light, and the only light that was on was a low tire pressure alert due to the sudden cold weather. On the way to work that day (about 8 hours prior to the incident), my car was making a loud noise but driving fine. Once I left work, I continued to notice the abnormal noise. I stopped at a red light then accelerated to turn at the intersection. Once I turned, I made it about a quart of a mile before my car stopped accelerating.

They had to replace 4 lug nuts as they were swollen.  (I didn\u2019t even know this was possible!).  A simple and inexpensive tire repair turned into more than expected, which is rough when you\u2019re on a small, fixed income.

As a side note, and something that maybe should be filed as a separate complaint, is that the back-up camera malfunctions frequently\u2026sometimes with image appearing upside down or a completely black screen.  I spoke with two separate repair shops and was told it couldn\u2019t be fixed\u2026had to be replaced\u2026and was quoted over $500 to replace it\u2026obviously something I cannot afford to do.  Was told it\u2019s a common issue on Escapes, yet there have been no recalls for this issue.  If we\u2019re really trying to improve safety, then maybe this issue needs to be addressed as well.  I have heard they will be required on new cars in the future; but something needs to be done about existing failures\u2026and to set a standard regarding future failures on those new cars.   My camera went out after warranty expiration, so I had no way to afford to fix it.  Ford should stand behind their product and replace these defective cameras.  My car now has 95,207 miles on it, and the camera failed over a year ago.  I wouldn\u2019t think a 7-year-old (6-year-old at time of failure) car with less than 100,000 miles on it should have that type of failure.  Ford needs to use better equipment or offer better warranties.  For most of us, $500 is a pretty substantial expense, and I\u2019ll bet there are a lot of Escapes with defective cameras that people can\u2019t afford to fix.",

This should be covered under the emissions defect warranty but the part is not listed. The weird part is this same exact issue is listed under numerous recalls for different models such as the Ford Focus. I have no idea why Ford is not acknowledging this issue on the Escape ,especially on the 1.6 EcoBoost engine - which is a PAIN to change the canister purge valve.

Everything was fine while driving this particular day. My husband and I alternated between drivers, him and I. Suddenly the car was revving itself as I pushed on the gas pedal. The vehicle suddenly with no warning stopped picking up speed then would pick up speed when you least expected it. I didn't receive any warning on the dashboard until this had been going on for nearly 2 hours so there was definitely a delayed response on the dashboard of any warning or malfunction. My husband and I pulled over multiple times, turned off the car and allowed it to sit for 15-30 minutes then carried on our way. It wasn't until 2 hours after this issue started that we suddenly received a warning on the dashboard that stated transmission fault service now. Every time we would stop, turn off the car and turn it back on the warning on the dashboard disappeared. It would eventually come back on approximately 20-30 minutes later. We were far from home and wouldn't have been able to get a tow unless we were within a 100 mile radius. We drove the vehicle as far as we could then without warning the vehicle it shut off. It lost all power completely. I took the vehicle for a diagnostic to a reputable Ford Dealership and I'm being told that I need an engine and transmission. I did a bit of research and found that Ford Escape are nitrous for Engine and Transmission issues. I've found several articles where individuals complained of the exact same issue as mines. Ford needs to be held accountable for making such an unreliable vehicle! They made a vehicle that is known to have a multitude of major safety issues yet has done nothing to resolve the matter. Now we are stuck with a vehicle that doesn't work! We have to continue making payments on a vehicle that is of no use! We are both disabled as well so this vehicle was our lifeline to getting around!",

She stated that she needed to get into the cargo area and that I needed to turn the vehicle off so that it could be opened.  I questioned why I could not just push the door open button and she stated that it was a safety feature.  She came around to the outside of the driver's door and said to reach in and turn it off, at which time the SUV immediately went into reverse, caught me under the door and dragged me approximately 20-25 feet   The vehicle came to rest partially on the driveway and partially in grass.  I had road rash on my back and massive blood loss in my abdomen as well as bruising on thigh and elbows. It is my understanding that this model has been recalled for both the lack of chime when running, key in the ignition, door open AND a transmission bushing that malfunctions and does not properly go into park by using the gear shifter. And that others have been dragged by their 2014 Escapes.   I do not own this vehicle and the owner stated that I did not properly put it into park OR knocked it out of park when I reached in to turn the ignition off.

        "summary": "What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? Rack and Pinion Gear Assembly. Yes, but already inspected by Ford Dealership. How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? Stopped to get gas while on a trip, when turned the engine on, the steering wheel would not turn. It was completely locked with no prior warning. If this had happened on the interstate, I could have wrecked with children in the vehicle. I am not even sure I would have been able to turn the wheel to pull off to the side of the road. VERY dangerous. Had to be towed 24miles to closest Ford dealership and spent the night in a strange town as everything was closed and couldn't get rental as the supply was low in the tiny town. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes, dealer service center confirmed problem and informed me it would cost $3K to fix on my 2014 Ford Escape, which only has 54K miles on it. Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? Yes, by Ford's service center, where the vehicle is being repaired. Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No warning until after the problem occurred. The reading stated, \"Steering Assist Fault Service Required\" when I started my car to a locked steering wheel.",

        "summary": "After a 45 minute highway drive, I left my vehicle running in park to go run into a store briefly. Upon re-entering my car and shifting into reverse my engine revved but the car did not move. Initially I thought I was caught on a curb until all of a sudden the transmission caught an jolted the car backwards. I just barely managed to get the car home but after catching gears to move forward it would slip the engine would rev and then catch and jolt forward. Eventually it died and had to be pushed home. After reading online about this issue it seems common for this model and year, however my vehicle fell into a different made year.   My big concern here is this happened without warning as seems to be the case with many other. Luckily i was a short ways from my destination and also parked in a parking lot when it first occurred, rather than doing 65 on the highway in  the fast lane. A recall on all transmission from 2014 Ford Escapes should be activated to correct this issue. Multiple mechanics have mentioned it is a terrible year for the car, so clearly its common knowledge that Ford has slightly addressed. I do not care that I have to pay for this expensive fix, I am more concerned about it happening to other and severe accidents occurring.",

SO CANNOT ADD MORE COOLANT YET ENGINE LIGHT SAYS 'LOW ENGINE COOLANT' TODAY, AS WITH THE OWNER COMPLAINTS, I WAS GOING UP A HILL, AND A RED ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON SAYING 'ENGINE TOO HOT, TURN OFF IMMEDIATELY AND PULL OVER' WELL I COULDN'T PULL OVER ON THE HILL SO WITHIN ONLY A FEW SECONDS, VEHICLE SHOOK, AND TURNED OFF LEAVING ME STUCK/STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HILL WITH NO ONE TO HELP. WAITED TURNED ON AGAIN WAS ABLE TO GO MAYBE 2 FT, LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, SHUT OFF VEHICLE AGAIN. IT IS ONLY 46 DEGREES OUT TODAY AND BARELY STARTED DRIVING WHEN THIS HAPPENED. I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE THIS HAPPENING ON THE FREEWAY LIKE OTHER OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM ARE HAVING! I'M SCARED TO DRIVE IT. LET ALONE TEACH MY DAUGHTER TO DRIVE ON IT! I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING HER A SAFE VEHICLE. I CHECKED VIA VIN NUMBER AND SHOWS ON OPEN RECALLS, YET, THIS IS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM OTHER OWNERS ARE HAVING. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED! PLEASE CONSIDER REVIEWING AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP IN RESOLVING THIS ISSUE.",

I PAID FORD $600 TO REPLACE THE TANK. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2020, THE ENGINE OVERHEATED AGAIN, SUDDENLY SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING 55 MI/HR ON A BUSY ROAD.

THE DEALERSHIP DOCUMENTED THE RECALL REPAIR AS 1.4 HOURS TO GET INSIDE THE DOORS AND PERFORM THE WARRANTY SERVICE.  WE WERE NOT CHARGED FOR THE RECALL REPAIR.  PRIOR TO THIS REPLACEMENT, AND AS SOLE OWNERS OF THE 2014 ESCAPE, WE HAD NOT HAD AN ISSUE WITH DOOR LATCH FAILURE.  ON AUG 31, 2019 IN OXNARD, CA WE EXPERIENCED A DOOR LATCH FAILURE ON THE DRIVER SIDE REAR DOOR; IT UNEXPECTEDLY OPENED WHEN WE PARKED.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CLOSE, LATCH OR SECURE THE DOOR.  THE CAR DOOR ALERT SYSTEM INDICATED A DOOR WAS OPEN.  WHEN WE ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE DOOR, IT WOULD JUST BOUNCE BACK OPEN.  WE REFERRED TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL FOR A QUICK FIX AND FOLLOWED THE MANUAL LOCK INSTRUCTIONS AND IT DID NOT WORK.  WE SECURED THE DOOR BY ATTACHING A BUNGEE CORD TO THE OTHER REAR DOOR AND DROVE TO A DEALERSHIP.  ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 AT SIMI VALLEY FORD IN SIMI VALLEY, CA THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DIAGNOSED A DOOR LATCH FAILURE FOR THE REAR DRIVER SIDE DOOR AND RECOMMENDED A REPLACEMENT AT A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $325.  WE WERE INFORMED THE RECALL REPAIR HAD BEEN CLOSED OUT ON DECEMBER 31, 2018 BY RICHMOND VALLEY FORD.  WE WERE TOLD THE REPLACEMENT PART IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE WE HAD EXCEEDED THE 12,000 MILE (OR 12 MONTH) THRESHOLD FOR REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE DOOR LATCH IS A MILEAGE DEPENDENT REPAIR AND WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE ORIGINAL RECALL.  WE ARE REPORTING THAT IT APPEARS THE RECALL REPAIR HAS ITSELF FAILED.

COULD NOT CHANGE THE BACK WIPER BLADE HAD TO TAKE IT IN (WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE CENTER THEY HAD ISSUES IN THE BEGINNING FIGURING IT OUT ALSO). NOW THE SMELL ISSUE HAD MADE THIS A BAD EXPERIENCE.

THREE WEEKS AGO I CAME OUT OF A FREEWAY AND TRIED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN ON A FAST MOVING LOCAL ROAD. I MADE THE TURN AND PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. THE ENGINE REVVED UP BUT THERE WAS NO MOTION. I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY TURN ON THE HAZARD FLASH LIGHTS TO WARN APPROACHING VEHICLES BEHIND. FINALLY I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR \"SLOWLY\" AND THE CAR DID MOVE AND PICK UP SPEED. THERE WERE NO FURTHER ISSUES THAT DAY.    I HAD SENSED \"BUMPY GEAR SHIFTS\" AND \"JERKY ACCELERATIONS\" EVEN BEFORE THE ABOVE INCIDENT. I INSTINCTIVELY \"KNEW\" THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT BUT DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.    TWO DAYS AGO MY WIFE CALLED ME AT WORK AND SAID THAT AFTER BACKING OUT FROM THE GARAGE, THE CAR WAS NOT PICKING UP SPEED. THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT HAD ALSO COME UP. SHE SOMEHOW LIMPED SLOWLY BACK INTO THE GARAGE.     WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I TRIED IT TOO. I FOUND THAT ONLY THE \"REAR DRIVE\" WAS WORKING. THE \"FORWARD DRIVE\" HARDLY WORKED. OFTEN WHILE IN \"DRIVE\" MODE, THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARDS ON OUR MILDLY SLOPED DRIVEWAY!  USING \"THE LOWEST GEAR\" I SOMEHOW PUT IT BACK INTO THE GARAGE.    YESTERDAY I GOT IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP. BEING A SATURDAY, THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING MORE. THEY SAID THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT TOMORROW (MONDAY).

WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT BEING COVERED UNDER THE RECALL, HE QUICKLY SAID IT WAS NOT AND THE REPAIR WOULD BE $8,000.00.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY FOR FURTHER REVIEW.  DURING THE SAME SERVICE VISIT, THE TECH PERFORMED RECALL 16S30 ON ALL DOOR LATCHES.  THE NEXT DAY I FOUND THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR WINDOW TO NOT BE OPERATING PROPERLY.  KNOWING THAT THE TECH HAD TO ACCESS THE REPAIR FROM THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR PANEL, I ASKED THE DEALER TO TAKE CARE OF THE WINDOW.  WHILE IN THE SERVICE SHOP FOR THE WINDOW, THE SERVICE ADVISER TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CHECKING THE MOTOR AGAIN.  THIS TIME HE CLAIMS THE \"MASTER MECHANIC\" DIAGNOSED IT AND EVERYTHING IS FINE.  THEY INSTALLED THE PART AFFECTED BY THE RECALL AND THIS TIME THEY TOPPED OFF THE COOLANT.  I SUSPECT THE REASON FOR TAKING ANOTHER LOOK IS BASED ON MY COMPLAINT TO THE MOTOR COMPANY.   I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THE HEAD IS CRACKED OR NOT.  THEY DIDN'T REMOVE IT FOR PROPER TESTING.  BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, I WOULD SAY THEY HAVE NO INTENTION ON GETTING INVOLVED IN SUCH AN EXTENSIVE REPAIR.  THE DEALER EVEN FAILED AT THE DOOR LATCH.  THEY SAID THE WINDOW FAILURE IS A COINCIDENCE AND TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY.  THE WINDOW IS STILL NOT WORKING.

TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS GETTING ON THE FREEWAY AND I RECEIVED A SEVERE WARNING FOR OVER HEATING. MY CAR STARTED SHAKING AND AN ALARM WAS GOING OFF. I PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY TO OBSERVE THAT MY COOLANT BOTTLE WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY. I HAD MY CAR  IN THE SHOP FOR NEARLY A WEEK BEFORE THEY DISCOVERED NOW THAT I NEED A NEW COOLANT BYPASS VALVE. I BELIEVE THAT FORD NEEDS TO EXPAND THEIR RECALL (17S09) TO INCLUDE THE ACTUAL ISSUE OF WHAT IS CAUSING THE LOCALIZED OVERHEATING, WHICH IS A LACK OF COOLANT FLOWING THROUGH THE ENGINE LEADING TO A CRACK IN THE CYLINDER HEAD. I HAVE TO SPEND NEARLY $900 TO FIX THIS PART ON A CAR BUILT IN 2014. FORD'S SOLUTION TO FIXING THE POSSIBLE CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD IS NOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY THE COOLANT IS LEAKING, BUT TO INSTALL A SENSOR TO THEN MAKE OWNERS HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CHECK THEIR COOLANT SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT A FAIR SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEM. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT TO MAKE OWNERS HAVE TO PAY FOR THE FAULTY COOLANT SYSTEM. THIS IS UNSAFE. MOST AVERAGE CONSUMERS ARE NOT MECHANICS AND WE SHOULD NOT BE SADDLED WITH HAVING TO CONSTANTLY MONITOR OUR COOLANT LEVELS BECAUSE FORD DEVELOPED A FAULTY COOLANT SYSTEM THAT COULD LEAD TO CYLINDER CRACKS THAT CAUSE ENGINE FIRES.

THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT OCCURRED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER THE CAR LEFT THE WARRANTY PERIOD BY DATE (>3 YEARS).

WE SAW THAT THE GLASS HAD BURST ALMOST COMPLETELY, LEAVING ONLY APPROXIMATELY 1.5\" MARGINS OF SHATTERED GLASS AROUND THE EDGES. THE RUBBER BOND THAT SEALS THE GLASS ON ALL FOUR SIDES TO THE ROOF OF THE VEHICLE BENT TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS FLAILING ABOUT ON THE HIGHWAY. THE SHATTERED PIECES OF GLASS CHIPPED/SCRATCHED/DAMAGED THE ROOF RACK, REAR PANORAMIC ROOF GLASS (THE PANORAMIC ROOF ON THE THIS ESCAPE IS COMPRISED OF TWO GLASSES, ONE IN THE FRONT THAT SLIDES OPENED AND CLOSED, AND THE REAR ONE THAT REMAINS STATIONARY) AND THE ROOF OF THE VEHICLE.

IT IS ABSOLUTELY A DEFECTIVE COMPONENT THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR.    WHILST ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WE CONTACTED OUR FORD DEALERSHIP. THEY TOLD US TO SEND PICTURES. WE DID AND THEY SENT THEM TO FORD CORPORATE FOR APPROVAL. THEY ANSWERED THAT SINCE THEY CAN'T SEE THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENT IN THE PICTURES, THEY CAN ASSUME SOMETHING IMPACTED THE GLASS AND THEREFORE THE INCIDENT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR WARRANTY SERVICE.

MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC AND ALSO GOING INTO REVERSE, THE CAR ALMOST STALLS AND DOES NOT ACCELERATE AS QUICKLY AS IT SHOULD GIVEN THE PRESSURE ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT SEEMS AS IF ALL OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THE SAME CORE PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE/TRANSMISSION AND I SEE OTHER COMPLAINTS HERE SIMILIAR TO THIS. I'VE HAD THE CAR FOR 8 MONTHS AND IT SEEMS TO BE MORE FREQUENT AS TIME PASSES. THESE ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE NOTICABLE WITH DAILY DRIVING, BUT MY HUSBAND HAS NOTICED DURING THE FEW TIMES HE DRIVES THE CAR.

IT WAS THEN TAKEN FROM A NEW CAR AND PLACED ON MY CAR. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT THEY SAID THEY CANNOT GIVE ME A NEW CAR.  *TR",
