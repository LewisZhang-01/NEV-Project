Doing a google search and reviewing videos of this issue reveals a pheonomea referred to as 'death wobble'.  This has happened to me at least 8 times over the past 8-10 months.  I had the shocks changed recently hoping that this would fix the problem.  This did NOT fix the problem.  On one occassion while driving in Pennsylvania towing my boat, I was nearly in an accident.  When the vibration/attenuation occurred I was driving approx 70mph and had to slow to 40mph  nearly causing an accident.  This is a very scary issue that apparently through research Ford is well aware of.  I have my truck at the dealership as I write this complaint and they are saying they cannot identify the problem....So, the genesis of the Ford class action law suit was a similar issue.  The dealership turned a customer away with a known safety issue.  Wonder if this is going to happen to me?  If I am turned away with a known safety issue and end up in an accident, you will certainly hear from me again!  This is crazy.  Merry Christmas!",
