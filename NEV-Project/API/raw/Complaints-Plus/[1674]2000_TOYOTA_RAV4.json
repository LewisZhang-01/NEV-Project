ON JULY 8,2002 I EXPERIENCED AN ACCELERATION PROBLEM WHILE ON MY WAY TO WORK. I WAS GOING AROUND 55 MPH ON  FREEWAY, WHEN SUDDENLY MY CAR STARTED TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN.  DESPITE APPLYING THE BRAKES, THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE TO ABOUT 70MPH FROM 55MPH.  I TRIED PUTTING MY FOOT UNDER THE THROTTLE TO PULL IT UP WITHOUT SUCCESS,  I ALSO TRIED PUSHING BACK ON THE MAT,  THINKING THE MATT WAS IN THE WAY,  BUT THE MATT WAS NOT STUCK UP AGAINST THE THROTTLE.  I ALSO  PUT ON MY FLASHERS TO TRY AND WARN OTHER DRIVERS THAT I WAS HAVING A PROBLEM.  I KEPT THINKING, \"WITH A GAS TANK HALF FULL, I WOULD NEED TO TRY AND DRIVE TO SEATTLE IN ORDER FOR THE GAS TO RUN OUT, WHICH WOULD THEN STOP THE CAR\".  MEANWHILE, I CONTINUED TO KEEP TRYING TO PUSH THE THROTTLE UP WITH MY FOOT AND APPLY THE BRAKES.   AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN ETERNITY, BUT WAS PROBABLY ONLY A FEW MINUTES, BECAUSE I DROVE PASS MY USUAL EXIT , THE CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN AND I HAD CONTROL OF THE CAR AGAIN.  I DON'T KNOW IF MY PUSHING UNDER AND UP ON THE THROTTLE DID IT.  I TOOK IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY \"DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT\".  I STILL HAVE THE SERVICE INVOICE , WHICH DOCUMENTS MY PROBLEM.  NATURALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE WHOLE SITUATION AND IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE CAR AGAIN.  HOWEVER, I ALSO HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE ACCELERATION SINCE.  IT SEEMS THOUGH THAT TOYOTA'S ACCELERATION PROBLEM STARTED WAY BACK.

FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRES I HAVE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS SOON?  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN, THANK YOU.( DOT NUMBER: BM13571-4 TIRE SIZE: P265/75R15 )",
