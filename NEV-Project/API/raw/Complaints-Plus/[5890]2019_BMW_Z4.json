The car was in a collision at low speed (under 35mph) with the car in front of me which put me at risk. BMW sent an engineer from N.J. to inspect the car. The is under warranty and it was in perfect working order. The engineer determined that the system did not engage because the accelerator was depressed, I was told that the system does not work when the accelerator is depressed but that is not how the system is advertised and it is not how it was described in ALL of the BMW marketing materials.",
