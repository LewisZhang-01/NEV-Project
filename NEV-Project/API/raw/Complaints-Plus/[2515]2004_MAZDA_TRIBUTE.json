        "summary": "I HAD RECEIVED TWO NOTICES OF RECALL ON MY MAZDA TRIBUTE FOR A POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH A STUCK THROTTLE.  APPROXIMATELY 4 OR 5 MONTHS AGO, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALER TO COMPLETE THE RECALL.  BEFORE THIS RECALL I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS WITH A STUCK THROTTLE.    ON THE ABOVE DATE, I WAS RETURING TO MY HOME ON A TURNPIKE TOLL ROAD.  I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 80 MPH.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO EXIT THE TOLL TOAD, MY THROTTLE STUCK AND WOULD NOT ALLOW MY VEHICLE TO SLOW DOWN.  THIS EXIT INVOLVED A SHARP CURVE AND A TOLL GATE AREA.  I MADE MY WAY THROUGH THE GATE BY CONSTANTLY APPLYING THE BRAKE. I FINALLY EXITED THE ROAD AND ENTERED A PARKING LOT.  THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV AT A VERY HIGH RPM.  I PLACED THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND THEN PARK.  IT CONTINUED TO REV NEAR THE 5 AND 6 RPM LEVEL. I TURNED IT OFF AND RESTARTED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  IT CONTINUED TO REV AND WHEN I TRIED TO PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE, IT JUMPED AND RACED FORWARD.  ON DECEMBER 24, 2013, I GOT THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALER.  AS I PULLED IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP, THE VEHICLE AGAIN STARTED TO REV UP TO 2 OR 3 RPMS.  THE DEALERSHIP LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND TAPPED ON A VALVE IN THE TOP OF THE MOTOR.  THE ENGINE THEN SLOWED DOWN.  AT AN EXPENSE OF $235 DOLLARS, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WAS THIS VALVE THAT NEEDED REPLACED AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL!!!!!  THEN ON JANUARY 6, 2014, I WENT TO START MY VEHICLE AND IT IMMEDIATELY STARTED IDLING VERY HIGH.  I ATTEMPTED TO START AND STOP IT MANY TIMES WITH NO RESULTS.  I FINALLY GOT IT TO MY HOUSE BY RIDING THE BRAKE AND AT TIMES PLACING IT IN NEUTRAL.  IT WAS VERY ICY AT THE TIME AND THE VEHICLE WOULD SURGE AND NEVER STOP THE HIGH REVING OF THE RPMS.  BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE VERY SCARY AND OCCURRED DURING POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS.  THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO REACT IN A CALM MATTER AND CONTROL THE VEHICLE!  *TR",

I AUTHORIZED THIS WORK TO BE COMPLETED AND PAID FOR THE REPAIRS.  SUBSEQUENTLY I WENT TO SHOWCASE MAZDA DEALERSHIP TO REQUEST A REFUND FOR THE AMOUNT I PAID FOR NEW ROTORS.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT ROTORS WERE A \"WEAR\" ITEM, EVEN THOUGH ROTORS ARE NOT LISTED IN THE WARRANTY EXCLUSIONS. I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF THE SOFT MATERIAL THESE ROTORS ARE MADE FROM, THEY WEAR MORE EASILY.  IN MY OPINION THIS IS \"DEFECTIVE MATERIAL\" NOT A \"ROUTINE WEAR ITEM\". THE WARRANTY STATES \"WORN BRAKE AND CLUTCH LININGS\" ARE EXCLUDED.  A ROTOR IS NOT A BRAKE LINING. I BELIEVE MAZDA SHOULD PAY FOR REPLACEMENT OF ALL WORN ROTORS DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD, INCLUDING MINE.

MY MAZDA 6 RECIEVED 6,000 DOLLARS IN DAMAGE THAT I KNOW OF SO FAR NOT TO MENTION THE PERSON THAT I CRASHED INTO.  MY INSURANCE WILL  NOT PAY FOR THE TIRE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE ACCIDENT.

THE VEHICLE STALLED NEAR THE END OF THE FLOODED CONDITION AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART SEVERAL TIMES BUT WOULD STALL AGAIN.  WHILE STALLED IN THE FLOODED ROADWAY, SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES INCLUDING PASSENGER CARS (CHEVY MALIBU, NISSAN MURANO) PAST BY OUR STALLED TRIBUTE ON THE LEFT SIDE IN DEEPER WATER.  THE TRIBUTE FINALLY STARTED UP AND WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE OFFICE.

INSPECTION OF THE AIR INTAKE REVEALS IT IS DIRECTED TO THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WHEREAS MOST OTHER VEHICLES HAVE IT DIRECTED TO THE SIDE UNDER A FENDER TO PROTECT IT FROM WEATHER CONDITIONS.  IN ADDITION THE BRACKET SECURING THE INTAKE ENTRY ABOUT MID WAY DOWN THE FRONT GRILLE DOES NOT ALLOW MUCH AIR FLOW FROM ABOVE.
