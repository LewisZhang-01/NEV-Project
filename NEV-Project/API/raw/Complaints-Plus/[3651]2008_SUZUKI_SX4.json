IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLES, OVER TIME, THE OCS SENSOR MAT INSTALLED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT MAY FAIL DUE TO REPEATED FLEXING OF THE MAT FROM USE OF THE SEAT. AS A RESULT, DURING A CRASH NECESSITATING DEPLOYMENT, THE AIR BAG WILL DEPLOY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FRONT SEAT OCCUPANT IS AN ADULT OR A CHILD.  CONSEQUENCE:    AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT WITH A CHILD IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SEAT INCREASES THE RISK OF INJURY TO THAT CHILD.  CORRECTIVE ACTION:    SUZUKI WILL NOTIFY OWNERS AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT CUSHION ASSEMBLY (WHICH INCLUDES THE OCS SENSOR MAT) FREE OF CHARGE. SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF PARTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO FIX ALL OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES. OWNERS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL IN OCTOBER 2013 AND WILL RECEIVE A SECOND NOTIFICATION WHEN PARTS ARE AVAILABLE TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLE REPAIRED. OWNERS MAY CONTACT SUZUKI AT 1-800-934-0934.

KNOWING THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WON'T GIVE A LOANER VEHICLE UNTIL THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

AFTER GOING OFF THE ROAD, THE CAR ROLLED IN A VIOLENT SPIN. THE NOSE HIT THE GROUND ON THE FRONT RIGHT CORNER AND BLEW THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE. THE DRIVER'S SIDE THEN SLAMMED INTO A ROCK WALL WHICH BUCKLED THE ROOF TEN INCHES AND PUSHED THE DRIVER'S SIDE PILLAR POST IN ABOUT EIGHT INCHES, AND PUSHED THE DRIVER'S DOOR IN ALMOST TO THE STEERING WHEEL. THE CAR SPUN THEN IT HIT THE GROUND TWO MORE TIMES AND BLEW BOTH OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE TIRES. NOT ONE OF THE EIGHT AIRBAGS WENT OFF. MY TOP SPEED THAT DAY WAS 40 MPH. I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND I WENT OFF THE ROAD AND OFF AN EMBANKMENT AND DOWNHILL I WENT.    MY MAIN CONCERN ON THAT CAR IS THAT THE AIRBAGS DID NOT GO OFF. THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW ALSO SHATTERED AND I'M STILL PULLING TINY GLASS SLIVERS OUT OF MY LEFT EAR AND MUCH OF IT WAS PULLED OUT OF MY SCALP. I'M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT SHATTERPROOFING A SIDE WINDOW, BUT IF IT CAN BE DONE, IT SHOULD BE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SIDE AIRBAGS AREN'T GOING OFF. THE JACK WAS STOWED IN THE TRUNK IN IT'S PROPER HOLDING POSITION AND THE HOLDER BROKE DURING THE IMPACT AND THE JACK WAS LOOSE IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR WHERE MY KIDS SIT.
