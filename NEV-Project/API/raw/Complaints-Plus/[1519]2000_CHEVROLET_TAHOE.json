MY LOWER BODY WAS OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND AS I WAS CHECKING INSIDE THE BRAKE PEDAL THE VEHICLE STARTED ROLLING BACK ON ITS OWN OFF THE RAMP. THE DRIVER DOOR PULLED DOWN THE POLE FROM THE BACK PORCH AS IT WAS BACKING UP AND SHUT BACK HITTING MY KNEE AND INJURED IT. I HAVE A BRUISED LEFT SHOULDER AND BACK PAIN. MY KNEE IS BADLY SWOLLEN.   I WAS ABLE TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE BY PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL OTHERWISE THE DOOR WOULD HAVE HIT THE SECOND POLE HOLDING THE BACK PORCH AND IT WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED ALTOGETHER.  I INCURRED DAMAGE ON MY BACK PORCH; MY VEHICLE.  AFTER THAT INCIDENT I FOUND OUT THAT THE ATC FUSE SOMEHOW BLEW WHEN I WAS UNDERNEATH: THE 4WD INDICATOR WAS NOT LIT UP AT ALL, WHILE IT WAS SET IN 2HI THE WHOLE TIME. IT HAD SOMEHOW SWITCHED TO NEUTRAL ON ITS OWN WHEN THE FUSE BLEW. WHEN I REPLACED THE FUSE THE LIGHT WENT BACK TO THE 2HI POSITION. THE COLUMN SHIFTER WAS ON P THE WHOLE TIME EVEN AFTER IT ROLLED.    THIS INCIDENT IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND REQUIRES A RECALL BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM COULD CAUSE EXTENSIVE INJURY OR DEATH IN CASE THIS FUSE FAILS IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.     I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONTACTED BY GM TO FIX THE ISSUE AND COMPENSATE FOR ALL THE DAMAGES.  *TR",

ROYAL CHEVROLET SERVICE PERSONNEL INFORMED ME \"THE CABLES BROKE\".  THEY WERE UNABLE TO TELL ME THE REASON WHY.

JOVI SAID CHEVROLET WILL BE UNABLE TO ASSIST W/ HAVING IT REPAIRED (COST APPRX $238 ' ON MONDAY, I VOLUNTEERED TO PAY UP TO 1.5 HOURS OF LABOR FEES).

I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN # WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.

IF I TAP THE GAS PEDDLE A LITTLE, IT PRODUCES THE SAME RESULTS.I TOOK THE TRUCK TO HARBOR CHEVERLET, MICHIGAN CITY ON 2-25-02  FOR SERVICE AFTER IT HAD STALLED ON ME 8-10 TIMES SINCE NEW,AND THEY REPROGRAMMED THE PCM PER TSB #00-07-30-006, AND SENT ME ON MY WAY WITH 33092 MILES ON THE TRUCK. I RETURNED TO THE DEALER AGAIN ON 4-12-02 ,SAME COMPLAINT. THEY SAID NO PROBLEM FOUND AT THIS TIME.
