I HAD TO KEEP PUMPING THE BRAKES DOWN TO FLOORBOARD AND I'M NOT SURE THEY WERE EVEN WORKING AS I COASTED SAFELY OFF SIDE OF ROAD TO A STOP, I TURNED ENGINE OFF IMMEDIATELY CALLING MY DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT. I WOULDN'T DRIVE IT ANY FURTHER AS I FELT I HAD NO BRAKES WHATSOEVER.  DEALERSHIP HAD IT TOWED TO THEIR SHOP. THE NEXT AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH THEM. THEY STATED IT WAS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED (SEE RECALL NUMBER BELOW) BUT I NEVER RECEIVED IT. I DID RECEIVE A SEAT BELT RECALL SO I KNOW THEY HAVE MY CORRECT ADDRESS. I WAS TOLD IT WAS SOME PROBLEM WITH A MODULE AND I CAN COME PUCK TRUCK UP. IT WAS SCARY WHEN IT HAPPENED. I PURCHASED THIS PICKUP NEW ON AUGUST 21, 2019.

WHILE STILL IN THE PARKING LOT, TRAVELING APPROX 10-15MPH I WAS BARELY ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  IT TOOK MY FULL POWER ON THE PEDDLE TO STOP, AND APPROXIMATE 20-30 FEET OF DISTANCE BEFORE IT STOPPED FULLY.   I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE SERVICE TECH BACK AND INFORMED HER THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE WITH 5% OR SO BREAK CAPACITY.  SHE PROVIDED THE GM NUMBER FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO THEIR SHOP A SHORT TIME AGO AND I AM AWAITING THEIR FEEDBACK.   ON A SIDE NOTE, I WAITED IN THE TRUCK AS I DID NOT WANT TO SHUT IT DOWN, I WANTED THE SERVICE TECH TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT WAS ON THE SCREEN.   AFTER ABOUT 30 MINS, WITH ME IN THE DRIVERS SEAT WITH THE KEYS, THE TRUCK SHUT ITSELF OFF.    WHEN IT RESTARTED THE MESSAGES WERE GONE, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED.
