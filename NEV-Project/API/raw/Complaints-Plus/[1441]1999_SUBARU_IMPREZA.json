I HAVE CONTACTED MANY SUBARU 2.5RS OWNERS OVER THE INTERNET THIS LAST WEEK AND FOUND THAT MANY OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH REAR WHEEL BEARINGS SIEZING UP WITH VERY LOW MILES ON THEIR CARS.  ONE MAN REPORTED HE IS TAKING HIS 2.5RS  IN FOR THE THIRD TIME TO HAVE THE BEARINGS REPLACED, WITH ONLY 26,000 MILES ON THE CAR.  AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, EVERYONE THAT IS EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM IS GETTING THE SAME \"NO ONE ELSE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM\" ATTITUDE FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE DEALERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.   BUT WE ARE COMPLAINING, AND NO ONE IS LISTENING.  THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFFECT IN THE REAR WHEEL BEARINGS OR IN THE INSTALLATION PROCCESS AT THE FACTORY.  A SEIZED REAR WHEEL BEARING  COULD CAUSE AN OPERATOR TO LOOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  YOU SHOULD BE GETTING MORE COMPLAINTS ON THIS DEFFECT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS.  OWNERS ARE COMING TOGETHER VIA THE INTERNET AND VOICING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS, AND ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO FILE WITH THE NHTSA IF THEY HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I MORE THAN WELCOME ANY FEEDBACK YOU MAY HAVE TO MY E-MAIL OR TELPHONE.  I WILL ALSO ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN IF NEEDED.  THANKYOU FOR HEARING MY CONCERNS ON THIS MATTER.",
