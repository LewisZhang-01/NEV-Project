The accident could have been worse.  No one else was injured only another car was hit.  I did reach out to Toyota and they said it could take 4-6 weeks for someone to look at the car.  I reach out to the dealer and waiting to hear back from the dealer.  The police department issued me a ticket, I have court on July 23, 2021.  State Farm insurance declared the car a total loss. No warning lamps or messages.  The first same incident happened on April 3, 2021, and on June 12, 2021, was the day of the accident. The incident and accident happened at the same location.

The car slowed and I was able to regain control of the steering wheel to pull over.  After driving a few miles further we once again came to a right turn and everything happened as before except with greater intensity.  We tried to straighten the steering wheel for control and were able to pull over into an empty parking lot.  By the time we came to a stop, which took all of just one or two minutes, smoke was coming out from under our hood.  We quickly got out of our car and opened the hood to see the battery in flames.  I called 911 while my husband poured his cup of water over the flames.  It stalled the fire but it continued to spark until help arrived.   I am certain if we had not had water the whole car would have caught on fire.   The car was towed to a Toyota dealership where we were told that their was an issue with battery installation.  At present it is being worked on but I have lost confidence in this vehicle  especially since we got no warning that there was a problem and we could have been badly injured or killed if the circumstances had been different and we had not been able to pull over and get out or have water with us.     We have since learned that this is an issue for many people who own this 2018 RAV4 vehicle.  I also learned there is no recall on this issue.  I hope that Toyota isn't waiting for someone to be seriously injured or die before they fix this problem.",

IT SUPPOSED TO ALERT ME WHEN THE CAR DRIVES OVER THE LINES WITH A BUZZER AND GENTLE NUDGE TO THE STEERING WHEEL. I CANNOT HEAR THE BUZZER AND FEEL ANY ACTION ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I WENT TO THE CULVER CITY TOYOTA DEALER TWO TIMES IN ATTEMPTING TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM FIXED. BOTH TIMES I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS AS DESIGNED. DURING A TEST DRIVE WITH THE MASTER TECHNICIAN, WITH RADIO OFF, AT SPEED LESS 50MPH, SO WITH THE MINIMAL ROAD NOISE, I COULD NOT HEAR THE BUZZER. I DO CLEARLY HEAR THE BUZZER OF THE PARKING SONAR OR PRE-COLLISION WARNING. SO THIS IS AT BEST USELESS FEATURE, AT WORST IT IS A DISTRACTION WHEN TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK AT A HIGHWAY.",

WHEN THIS FEATURE DISABLES ITSELF IT PREVENTS ALL USE OF HIGHBEAMS.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET HIGHBEAMS WHILE THE FEATURE IS \"DISABLED\" (EVEN IN COMPLETE DARKNESS) IS TO \"ROTATE\" THE STALK CONTROL AWAY FROM \"AUTO HEADLIGHT\" TO \"MANUAL HEADLIGHT\". THE FEATURE EVENTUALLY RE-ENABLES ITSELF, BUT USUALLY TAKES A NUMBER OF MINUTES, LEAVING ME WITHOUT THE SAFETY OF HIGHBEAMS FOR THAT PERIOD, UNLESS I GO THROUGH THE CUMBERSOME ACT OF TURNING HEADLAMPS TO \"MANUAL\".  THIS IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS DURING MY COMMUTE WHERE I DRIVE A NUMBER OF MILES ON UNLIT STATE ROADS.  I RELY ON HIGHBEAMS TO ALERT ME TO THE PRESENCE OF DEER AND OTHER ANIMALS CROSSING THE ROAD WHICH OCCURS ROUTINELY.  NOT HAVING HIGHBEAMS FOR A NUMBER OF MILES EXPOSES ME TO THE RISK OF NOT SEEING THESE HAZARDS IN TIME TO REACT PROPERLY.  IN ADDITION, HAVING TO DIVERT MY ATTENTION TO WHETHER THIS FEATURE HAS DISABLED ITSELF AND TAKING MANUAL ACTION TO CIRCUMVENT THE ISSUE IS A DISTRACTION WHILE MY FOCUS SHOULD BE ON POSSIBLE HAZARDS.  I HAVE REPORTED THE ISSUE TO TOYOTA.  CASE NUMBER [XXX] HAS BEEN ASSIGNED.  A TOYOTA CASE MANAGER CONTACTED ME AND STATED THAT SHE EXPERIENCES THE VERY SAME ISSUE WITH HER 2018 RAV4 BUT THERE ARE NO FIXES IDENTIFIED BY TOYOTA FOR THE ISSUE, SO THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING SHE OR THE DEALER CAN DO.  I STRONGLY FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT THERE IS A RISK THAT AN ACCIDENT WILL OCCUR, POSSIBLY THE STRIKING OF A PEDESTRIAN, DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY OR DISTRACTION TRYING TO OVERRIDE THE FEATURE WHILE DRIVING.

ASKING WHAT MY NEXT STEP SHOULD BE, I WAS TOLD TO CALL MY INSURANCE REP..AS THEY DID NOT COVER GLASS BREAKAGE. AFTER I GOT THE SUNROOF REPAIRED, I WROTE A LETTER TO TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS AND TOYOTA RHINELANDER DATED 9/16/18 OUTLINING MY CONCERNS.    MY REQUESTS WERE TWO-FOLD: 1) THAT THEY NEED ONLY TO REIMBURSE ME FOR MY MINIMAL REPAIR COSTS: ABOUT $350, AND 2) THAT SOMEONE TELL ME HOW, BY WHOM,  AND TO WHAT AGENCY THIS INCIDENT WOULD BE REPORTED. MY LETTERS WENT UNANSWERED.     I CONTACTED RHINELANDER ON OCT. 25, 2018 AND WAS ADVISED  TO CALL A HOT LINE NUMBER. I DID SO IMMEDIATELY AND WAS PROMISED A CALL THE NEXT DAY. I DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL BACK; A WEEK LATER I CALLED AGAIN AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE MANAGER. THE END RESULT WAS A DENIAL OF MY REQUEST. AGAIN, THE REASON GIVEN WAS THAT THEY COULD NOT ASSESS THE SITUATION BECAUSE II DID NOT BRING HE CAR INTO TOYOTA FOR AN INSPECTION AFTER THE EXPLOSION (AND, NOBODY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO DO THIS). I UNDERSTAND THE PERSON I TALKED WITH IS NO LONGER WITH THE COMPANY.    THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE IS SAFETY.  HAD THE DOOR TO THE SUNROOF BEEN OPEN  , I COULD HAVE BEEN SPRAYED WITH GLASS, SERIOUSLY INJURED OR  INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC COLLISION. THE DEAFENING NOISE ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY CAUSE A SERIOUS MISHAP.THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES, INCLUDING CONSUMER REPORTS, THAT REPORT THESE EXPLOSIONS, YET I WAS TOLD BY RHINELANDER THAT THEY NEVER HEARD OF AN EXPLOSION, AND A STONE PROBABLY CAUSED THE INCIDENT.

HOWEVER, THE SAFETY ISSUE I HAVE DISCOVERED IS THAT WHEN THE VEHICLE AUTOMATICALLY DECELERATES, IT APPARENTLY DOES NOT ACTIVATE THE BRAKE LIGHTS AND THE VEHICLE BEHIND YOU IS NOT WARNED THAT YOU ARE SLOWING DOWN.  TWICE IN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE, WHILE TRAVELING ON RELATIVELY STRAIGHT, FLAT, INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS, I HAD THE DYNAMIC RADAR CRUISE CONTROL ENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME REDUCED SPEED FAIRLY QUICKLY (FROM APPROXIMATELY 65 TO 45MPH) DUE TO ROAD CONSTRUCTION.  MY VEHICLE AUTOMATICALLY SLOWED ACCORDINGLY, BUT THE VEHICLE BEHIND ME DID NOT REALIZE I WAS SLOWING DOWN BECAUSE MY BRAKE LIGHTS DID NOT ACTIVATE AND I WAS VERY NEARLY REAR ENDED.  FORTUNATELY, SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WERE NARROWLY AVOIDED IN BOTH THESE INCIDENTS.
