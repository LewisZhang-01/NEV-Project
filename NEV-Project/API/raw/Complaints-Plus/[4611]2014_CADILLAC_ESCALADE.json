This is not my error/defective issue, but GM's. They have already indicated that people have been injured and died from this defective part. I believe Cadillac should accept the 'potential' risk should it be damaged. I am getting no where with Cadillac and would like to have the NHTSA to weigh in on their lack of support to mitigate this error. Certainly hoping that the dash does not crack, but I don't have the funds to take on that risk and they've left me in bad situation with a KNOWN risk of defective part.",
