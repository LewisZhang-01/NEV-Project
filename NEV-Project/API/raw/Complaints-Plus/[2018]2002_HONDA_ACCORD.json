I WAS A SINGLE PARENT AT THE TIME AND LEARNED TO LIVE WITH NO DASHBOARD LIGHTING AT NIGHT AND HAD THE AIR BAGS DISABLED.   I HAVE ALSO TAKEN THE CAR TO A CERTIFIED HONDA DEALER (UNION PARK HONDA WILMINGTON DE) AND THEY ALSO CONFIRMED THAT NEITHER OF THOSE REPAIRS WAS COVERED OR THE PRODUCT OF A RECALL.   I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD BUY HONDAS FOREVER BUT I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS 2002 ACCORD AND HOW IT FAILED SO SOON AFTER I PURCHASED IT WITH NO RECOURSE BUT TO PAY A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO FIX THE ISSUES. EQUALLY UPSETTING IS ALL OF THE ISSUES WITH AIRBAGS THAT ARE BEING REPLACED YET MY CAR, WITH THE FAILED AIRBAG, WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID BY ME TO BE FUNCTIONAL.    WHAT CAN HONDA DO FOR ME TO KEEP ME IN YOUR HONDA FAMILY?   *TR",

I ACTUALLY HAD WHEEL SPIN AT ONE POINT. THIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, AS THE VEHICLE WILL TAKE OFF ON ME. IF ACCELERATING AND THE CAR IS IN 2ND, THE CAR WILL NOT HAVE MUCH POWER, SO THEN I WILL GRADUALLY GIVE IT MORE GAS, ONLY TO HAVE IT DOWNSHIFT AND THEN TAKE OFF (WHEELS CHIRP AND EVERYTHING). IF I LET GO OF THE GAS IT WILL SLAM INTO SECOND AND LURCH A SECOND TIME, WHICH WHEN BRAKING IS VERY ANNOYING AND SEVERELY AFFECTS THE BRAKING DISTANCE. I ACTUALLY ALMOST HIT SOMEBODY THIS PAST WEEK BECAUSE OF A VERY SIMILAR INCIDENT. THIS INCIDENT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT BY LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH LOW TRACTION (I LIVE IN CHICAGO, WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MONTHS OF OPTIMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS). BESIDES THAT FACT, HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE, AND SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS TRANSMISSION YEARS AGO. HONDAS USED TO BE GREAT, BUT THIS IS REALLY HURTING THEIR REPUTATION WITH US.  *TR",

WE RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS MODEL YEAR LIKE THE PLAGUE.     THE TRANSMISSION BEGINS SLIPPING & EVENTUALLY HAS TO BE REPLACED, TYPICALLY SOON AFTER 90,000 MILES & WITH A REPAIR COST OF OVER $2,000. TRANSMISSION FAILURE HAS BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM FOR THE ACCORD & SEVERAL OTHER HONDA MODELS ALL THROUGH THE EARLY 2000S MODEL YEARS. HONDA EXTENDED THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY TO 93 MONTHS/109K MILES FOR THE 2000-2001 ACCORD AS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT, BUT OWNERS OF OTHER ACCORD MODEL YEARS WITH TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS ARE OUT OF LUCK.    SUBFRAME RUST NEAR THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL HAS BECOME A PROBLEM RECENTLY, DUE TO THE POORLY POSITIONED A/C DRAIN HOSE DIRECTLY ABOVE THAT AREA. REPAIR COST TO THE SUBFRAME IS OVER $2,000.    THE SRS WARNING LIGHT LIKES TO COME ON DUE TO A DEFECTIVE SEAT BELT SENSOR -- TYPICALLY THE DRIVER'S SIDE.

WAS CONTACTED BY SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, STATED FRONT CROSS BEAM WAS CRACKED NEARLY INTO TWO PIECES AND THAT DUE TO THE SERIOUS DANGEROUS CONDITION OF THE CAR IT CAN NOT BE DRIVEN. I WAS ASKED TO COME AND OBSERVE THE CONDITION. UPON ARRIVING I ASKED HOW THIS COULD OCCUR, CAR IS GARAGED, EXCELLENT CONDITION, WELL MAINTAINED. I WAS INFORMED THEY HAVE SEEN THIS CONDITION BEFORE AND THAT THE AIR CONDITIONING DRAINS ONTO THIS BEAM MAKING IT WET ALL THE TIME. THEY BELIEVE THIS HELPED THE BEAM RUST, IN ONE AREA ONLY, UNTIL EVENTUALLY NEARLY BREAKING INTO 2 PIECES. I ASKED IF HONDA ACKNOWLEDGED THIS DEFECT I WAS TOLD THEY KNOW THE DRAIN DRIPS ON THE BEAM AND THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT THERE WAS NO RECALL?? I CALLED HONDA USA FOR ASSISTANCE ON THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SAFETY CONDITION, I WAS INSTRUCTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE CARS AGE THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST. I WAS ONLY ASKING FOR HONDA TO SUPPLY THE PART, I WAS WILLING TO PAY THE LABOR COSTS. IF THIS FRONT CROSS BEAM WOULD HAVE BROKEN COMPLETELY THROUGH WHILE DRIVING IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE CAUSED A TRAFFIC CRASH RESULTING IN INJURY OR WORSE. I LEARNED THAT HONDA RECOGNIZED THE SAFETY PROBLEM  AND CHANGED THE AC DRAIN LOCATION IN NEWER MODELS YEARS 2004 OR 2005 SO THAT IT NO LONGER DRAINS ONTO THE BEAM. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONDITION THAT CERTAINLY HAS HAD TO RESULT IN TRAFFIC CRASHES, HOPEFULLY NO INJURIES HAVE OCCURRED.    *TR",

THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE FOR HONDA ACCORDS AS REPORTED ON SEVERAL WEBSITES AND KNOWN AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY INDEPENDENT MECHANICS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND REPREHENSIBLE FOR HONDA TO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  AT THIS CURRENT TIME HONDA REFUSES TO TAKE SUCH ACTION AND WILL ONLY OFFER MINOR REDUCTION IN REPAIR COSTS THAT HARDLY SEEMS FAIR TO THE THOUSAND'S OF OWNERS AFFECTED BY THIS.  PLEASE KEEP RECORD OF THIS AND OFFER WHATEVER ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE.

I BOUGHT IT FOR MY TWO SONS TO USE (AGES 17 AND 18).  A LITTLE OVER A MONTH OF OWNING THE VEHICLE, MY YOUNGER SON REPORTED TO ME THAT WHILE HE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE, SEVERAL OF THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD WENT OFF INCLUDING THE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT, THE TCS LIGHT AS WELL AS THE D4 LIGHT.  HE SAID THAT THE CAR STARTED ACTING WEIRD AND THAT THE ENGINE FELT LIKE IT WAS STUCK IN THE SAME GEAR.  THIS WAS WHILE HE WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE ENGINE STARTED RACING.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SEVERAL SHOPS INCLUDING AAMCO AND THEY ALL INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A HARD CODE AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  COST FROM AAMCO WAS BETWEEN $2,500 AND $3,000 DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY FIND WHEN THEY TAKE THE TRANSMISSION APART.  THE VEHICLE HAD ROUGHLY 92,000 MILES WHEN I PURCHASED IT AND BARELY HAD 1,000 MILES WHEN THE ISSUE POPPED UP.  THE CAR REMAINS SOMEWHAT DRIVABLE BUT THE ENGINE SEEMS LIKE IT IS GOING TO EXPLODE BECAUSE THE GEARS SEEM TO BE STUCK AND THE CAR RACES ESPECIALLY WHEN ON THE HIGHWAY.  AGAIN, THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED FOR MY TWO SONS DUE TO THE SUPPOSED RELIABILITY OF THE HONDA VEHICLE.  RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ON LINE, I'VE COME ACROSS SEVERAL SITES EXPOSING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THESE HONDA ACCORDS.  I'VE CALLED HONDA AND THEIR ONLY RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY DO NOT HANDLE RECALLS, NHTSA DOES AND UNTIL THEY DETERMINE THIS IS AN ISSUE, HONDA CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I THINK THAT IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT NHTSA DOES THE RIGHT THING BY THESE HONDA OWNERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES THAT I AM HAVING WITH MY TRANSMISSION! *TR",

UP UNTIL THIS POINT, I HAVE NOT HAD MANY ISSUES WITH MY HONDA. MY HONDA ACCORD 2002 WAS A WONDERFUL CAR, MY VERY FIRST NEW CAR, WHICH I WAS THE ORIGIONAL OWNER, FINANCES, AND SO ON. I DROVE THIS CAR OFF THE LOT WITHOUT EVEN 1 MILE ON THE DASH, AND THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME BY LAW THEY HAD TO PUT AT LEAST 1 MILE ON THE DASH, IN ORDER TO SELL THE CAR, AND THEY ALLOWED ME TO PUT THAT 1 MILE ON THE DASH. I BOUGHT THIS CAR WITH THE INTENTIONS OF KEEPING WELL PAST 400K MILES, AND POSSIBLY PASSING IT ONTO MY SON AS HIS FIRST CAR, WHICH WOULD OF GIVEN ME THE SECURITY THAT I WAS PASSING HIM SOMETHING RELIABLE, AND SOMETHING I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE LITTLE TO NO MAJOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR, AND CLEARLY AT THE TIME THAT WAS THE REPARTITION THAT HONDAS HAD'NOW, I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS CAR TO ANYONE, KNOWING WHAT I KNOW. BEFORE ALL OF THIS OCCURRED, I WAS BASICALLY DRIVE MY HONDA TO AND FROM WORK, TO AND FROM MY KIDS SCHOOL, AND IN AND AROUND DAILY TRAVELS, WITH EXCEPTION TO OCCASIONAL FAMILY OUTINGS. I RECENTLY PAID THIS CAR OFF, AND SINCE THIS TIME, I HAVE COME OUT OF MY POCKET WITH ALL KINDS OF UNFORESEEN EXPENSES AND ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.   MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH MY 2002 HONDA ACCORD'S TRANSMISSION OCCURRED WAS WHEN I WAS DRIVING AT 35 MPH AND THE CAR BUCKED IN ONGOING TRAFFIC AND COMPLETELY STALLED. I WAS AMAZED BECAUSE, MY CAR HAD NOT DID THIS BEFORE, AND IT WAS TERRIFYING CONSIDERING I HAD MY KIDS AND 2 OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE CAR, AND IT DID A NUMBER ON OUR NECKS. NOW, MY HONDA ACCORD 2002 NOW BEGINS TO SLIP EVERY TIME I PULLED OFF AT THE LIGHT, STOP SIGN, AND SO ON. HONDA'S TRANSMISSION STARTED SLIPPING OUT OF GEAR, JERKING, AND WHILE DRIVING AT A SPEED OF 45-60 MPH MY CAR WOULD START TO INCREASE SPEED. *TR",

I NOTICED SUBSEQUENTLY, THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL HAD ALSO FAILED. THE DEALERSHIP (DARLINGS HONDA, IN BANGOR, ME), TOLD ME THAT THE THROTTLE BODY HAD BROKEN, NEAR THE ATTACHMENT POINT OF THE CRUISE ACTUATOR CABLE. THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY. IT APPEARS TO ME, THAT THERE IS A FLAW IN THE VEHICLE, THAT ALLOWS RUNAWAY ACCELERATION WHEN A MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THIS KIND OCCURS. I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA (\"BRIAN\" AT 800-999-1009 X 117738), AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO HIM. HE GOT BACK TO ME TWO DAYS LATER, AND TOLD ME THAT HONDA WAS UNWILLING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE WARRANTS AN INVESTIGATION, AS IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN DEATH OR SEVERE INJURY.  THE SAME VEHICLE ALSO HAS DEVELOPED A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO. IT FEELS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS BEGINNING TO FAIL. THERE IS A DELAY BETWEEN GEARS, THAT FEELS LIKE THE TORQUE CONVERTER ISN'T LOCKING UP AS FAST AS IT USED TO. IT MAKES PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC MORE DIFFICULT. DESPITE THERE HAVING BEEN AN ADMITTED TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, WITH 2002 V6 ACCORDS, THE DEALER SUGGESTS THAT I TRY ANOTHER TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE, INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION.

I WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE INTERSTATE BY DRIVING ON THE SHOULDER AND TOOK LOCAL ROADS BACK TO MY HOME.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP WHERE THIS PROBLEM WAS CONFIRMED.      THIS IS THE SECOND COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE IN THE LAST 25 MONTHS.  THE FIRST INCIDENT ALSO RESULTED IN A NEAR ACCIDENT.  THIS ISSUE IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND WIDESPREAD ACROSS SEVERAL MODEL YEARS IN THE EARLY 1990'S.  HONDA REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE, HOWEVER, BUT FOR QUICK DRIVER REACTION THIS DEFECT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT ACCIDENT ON THE INTERSTATE.     AFTER THE FIRST FAILURE (IN DEC. 2007) HONDA AGREED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION REQUIRING ME TO PAY FOR 1/3 OF THE COST.  (THE CAR HAD 58,000 MILES AND WAS NOT IN ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY).  AFTER THIS FAILURE HONDA IS OFFERING TO PAY 50% OF THE COST.  (THE CAR HAS 110,000 MILES).  SO IT LOOKS LIKE EVERY 50,000 MILES OR SO THIS TRANSMISSION WILL SUFFER COMPLETE FAILURE.       HONDA HAS EXTENDED THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY FROM THE ORIGINAL (3YR/36000) TO (7YR/100000).

MOTOR MOUNTS ARE NOT A NORMAL MAINTENANCE ITEM; THEY ARE NOT LISTED IN THE HONDA RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE FOR HONDA ACCORDS UP TO 120,000 MILES AS AN ITEM THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR INSPECTED.

I HAVE KEPT UP THE MAINTENANCE FROM MINOR OIL CHANGES AND FLUID/FILTER CHANGES TO MAJOR TUNE UPS, ALL AT THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP. SINCE THAT TIME  I WOULD PUT BETWEEN 16 TO 18,000 MILES PER YEAR ON THE CAR. TWO YEARS LATER, BY AUGUST OF '06,  I FELT THAT THE CAR WAS NOT PULLING ITS WEIGHT PROPERLY AND TOOK IT IN FOR A CHECK UP.  THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD FIND; BUT KEEP A LOG OF WHEN AND WHERE IT OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND BRING IT BACK IN 2-4 WKS AND THEY WOULD CHECK IT AGAIN.  I DID THIS, BROUGHT THEM MY LOG, THEY LOOKED AT THE CAR AGAIN AND SAID IT NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION (THIS WAS AT 53,000 MILES). FORTUNATELY, IT WAS UNDER EXTENDED HONDA CARE WARRANTY, AND I PAID ONLY A $50 DEDUCTIBLE.  FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS, I PUT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 MILES PER YEAR ON IT AGAIN. THIS PAST OCTOBER I JUST HAD THEM REPLACE THE TIMING BELT, A LARGE TICKET ITEM! NOW, A MONTH LATER THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVING WITH A SLIGHT LURCHING AS I BEGIN TO MOVE FROM A STOP OR AS I DECELERATE TO BRAKE.  I TOOK THE CAR IN AND LOW AND BEHOLD, THEY TELL ME THE TRANSMISSION IS OUT! AGAIN!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  I HAVE FRIENDS WITH HONDAS AT 250,000 MILES AND NEVER LOST THEIR TRANNY!  WHAT CAN I DO?

ENGINE OIL LEAKED INTO THE COOLING SYSTEM ALSO.    THE HONDA DEALER TORN DOWN THE ENGINE, AND DID A SERIES OF INSPECTIONS, LEAK DOWN TEST, AND PRESSURE TEST.  NO VISIBLE SIGN OF A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  NO SIGNS OF WARPING AND/OR CRACKS ON THE CYLINDER HEAD.    THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT IS PROBABLY DUE TO A VERY POROUS CYLINDER HEAD.  THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE ENGINE OVERHEATING IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE POROUS CYLINDER HEAD ALLOWED ENGINE OIL TO LEAK INTO THE COOLING SYSTEM.  THE OIL DETERIORATED THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE THERMOSTAT.  (THIS WAS INDICATED BY FRESH ENGINE OIL RESIDUE FOUND ON THE DAMAGED RUBBER GASKET OF THE ORIGINAL THERMOSTAT.)   THE DETERIORATED RUBBER GASKET BLOCKED THE FLOW OF THE COOLANT.  WITHOUT ENOUGH FLOW RATE TO COOL DOWN THE SYSTEM, THE COOLANT BOILED INSIDE THE HOSES.  PRESSURE BUILT UP, AND THE UPPER RADIATOR HOSE BURST.  COOLANT LEAKED OUT FROM THE DAMAGED HOSE, AND THE ENGINE OVERHEATED.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE CAR HAS THIS PROBLEM.  IT HAS NO MAJOR PROBLEMS BEFORE.  I COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY MAINTENANCE ON TIME ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL.  ALL MAJOR MAINTENANCE SERVICES WERE PERFORMED BY THE DEALER.    TO CORRECT THE FAILURE, THE DEALER RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE WHOLE CYLINDER HEAD, BUT THE TOTAL REPAIR COST FOR IT, INCLUDING CHANGING THE OIL-CONTAMINATED HOSES AND OTHERS, COST MORE THAN $4200.  IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE. ALL THE OLD PARTS (DAMAGED HOSES, THERMOSTAT, ETC) ARE AVAILABLE.  FYI, IF IT HELPS ANY INVESTIGATIONS, THIS CAR IS STILL TORN APART AT THE DEALER AS OF TODAY. *TR",

WEATHER WAS NOT A FACTOR, AND OCCURRED AT APPROX 11:30AM.  THE DEER WAS AVERAGE IN WEIGHT, 70-90 LBS, VEHICLE SPEED WAS 45MPH AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.  THE POINT OF IMPACT APPEARED TO BE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD, EYE HEIGHT OF THE DRIVER, AND WAS SEVERE ENOUGH TO SHATTER APPROX 90% OF THE WINDSHIELD.  INTEGRITY OF THE WINDSHIELD REMAINED, AND WAS NOT EXPELLED FROM THE VEHICLE, NOR WAS IT PERFORATED, IT WAS JUST ALMOST COMPLETELY SHATTERED.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE ON MONDAY AT THE TOWING YARD, I DISCOVERED THAT THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE, FRONT AND BACK, HAD MANY  PARTICLES OF SHARP GLASS SHARDS, AND ALMOST A COMPLETE COVERING OF WHAT I WOULD CALL \"GLASS DUST\", WHICH I DID NOT EXPECT.  MY UNDERSTANDING OF SAFETY GLASS, WHEN SHATTERED, THE RESULT IS SMALL PARTICLES OF GLASS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PENCIL ERASER, WITHOUT THE SHARP SHARDS AND DUST.  MY DESCRIPTION OF THIS \"DUST\" IS JUST THAT - LIKE THE DUST ON FURNITURE IF LEFT UNDUSTED FOR A WHILE.  HAD MY WIFE NOT BEEN WEARING SUNGLASSES, SHE WOULD HAVE HAD SERIOUS INJURY TO HER EYES.  MY QUESTION (OR FOOD FOR THOUGHT) IS THIS.  IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR U.S. MANUFACTURED VEHICLE SAFETY GLASS, AND THAT WHICH IS IMPORTED?

ANYWAY, I TOOK THE CAR TO AUTO REPAIR SHOP \"MERCHANTS\" AND I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE CAR, THEY RECOMMENDED FLUSHING ALL THE FLUIDS (OIL, BRAKE FLUID, TRANS FLUID, RADIATOR), THE COST TO ME WAS ABOUT $800 WHICH INCLUDED NEW BRAKE PADS.

ANY WAYS I NEEDED THE TRANSMISSION RECONDITIONED WHICH COST ME $1,816.00 NOT AT HONDA BUT A GOOD TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP.  I WOULD JUST LIKE FOR SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS ON 2002 HONDA ACCORDS. THEY SHOULD NOT JUST GIVE OUT AT 47K. HONDA SHOULD HAVE OFFERED AT LEAST A FREE TOW TO DO DIAGNOSTICS WITH ONLY 47K HOW CAN THEY STAND BEHIND A PRODUCT THAT IS SO FAULTY AND HAVING SO MANY COMPLAINTS.  *TR",

ALL THREE HAPPENED WITHIN 36,000 MILES.   FIRST PROBLEM WAS A SEAT BELT SENSOR PROBLEM. IT WAS DETECTED SEVERAL MONTHS ON BOTH VEHICLES. AND I ASKED A HONDA MECHANIC TO FIX IT. HE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY IF YOU DROVE MORE. HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT GONE. AND COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, I STRONGLY ASK HONDA DEALER TO CHECK AND FIX IT. ONE WAS SEAT BELT SENSOR PROBLEM AND THE OTHER WAS THE MAIN SEAT BELT CONTROLLER.   SECOND PROBLEM WAS A TIMING RELATED ENGINE SURGE. IT HAPPENED ON BOTH HONDAS WITHIN 30,000 MILES ON THE SAME DAY. RPM OF BOTH HONDA WENT UP AND ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. EVEN IN BRAKING, I COULD FEEL VERY STRONG FORCE, WHICH MIGHT BREAK SOMETHING. IT WAS A SUDDEN SURGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A BIG ACCIDENT.

NO AIR BAG WAS EVER DEPLOYED WHEN HE HIT THE CURB AND SIGN WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS HE HIT A SIGN AND TREE STRIPPING THE FRONT BUMPER OFF AND  CRUSHED THE RADIATOR INTO THE ENGINE. NO AIR BAGS WEAR EVER DEPLOYED. EVEN THE POLICE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND QUESTIONED IT . IT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF HURST TEXAS. IN THESE FORUMS MANY DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF ENGINE FAILERE AND BRAKES IN SOME CASES. HONDA JUST PUT OUT A RECALL ON 1998-2000 FOR THE ENGINE IGNITION SWITCH SHORTING OUT CAUSING ENGINE FAILERE. I SUGGEST THEY INCREASE THAT RECALL TO 2002 POSSIBLY. ALSO I READ WHERE THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR IS GETTING WET AND SHORTING OUT CAUSING THE SAME THING IN SOME CARS. IN ONE CASE I READ THAT THE VACUMM HOSE TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER MAY BE BAD. PUMPING THE BRAKES CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. SO ANY CASE I THINK HONDA HAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH ENGINES STALLING WHILE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING. MY SON WAS LUCKY HE WAS ONLY DRIVING 15 MPH WHEN IT HAPPENED . IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE.

(I WAS TOLD IT WAS A FEATURE TO LET THE OWNER KNOW THE BATTERY WAS LOW, EXCEPT MY BROTHER HAD JUST CHARGED MY MOTHERS BATTERY THAT WEEK SOMETIME.)  DURING THAT TIME THEY SAY IT WENT OFF AND STOPPED TWICE.  THE SECOND TIME THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH MY MOTHER POSSIBLY CALLING FOR HELP.  SHE LIVED ALONE AND WAS 66 YEARS OLD.  THE FIRST TIME THEY HEARD THE ALARM THEY THOUGHT MAYBE SHE HAD WENT TO THE CAR FOR SOMETHING AND ACCIDENTALLY SET THE ALARM OFF.  SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD A CARDIO -CONVERSION 3 WEEKS PRIOR, WHERE THE DOCTORS ACTUALLY SHOCK THE HEART TO GET A NORMAL RHYTHM, MY MOTHERS HEART WAS BEATING TOO FAST FOR AWHILE.  THE PROCEDURE WAS SAID TO HAVE TOOK AND WAS TOO PROLONG HER LIFE 10 TO 15 MORE YEARS.  THE CORONER'S REPORT STATES SHE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK. SHE WAS FOUND IN THE DINING ROOM FLOOR WITH HER FEET POINTING TOWARD THE GARAGE, SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO CHECK ON THE CAR. MY SISTER-IN-LAW, A REGISTERED NURSE STATED THAT THE HORN MAY HAVE SCARED MY MOTHER CAUSING HER BLOOD PRESSURE TO ELEVATE AND CAUSED A HEART ATTACK.  SHOULDN'T THERE BE SOME SORT OF WARNING TO HEART PATIENTS CONSIDERING BUYING THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT PLEASE LET THE HONDA PEOPLE KNOW THIS IS A HAZARD. IF THIS ISN'T MAKING ANY SENSE TO YOU  I APOLOGIZE, I HAVEN'T MADE SENSE OF ANYTHING SINCE I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY MOM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

O WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 2002 HONDA ACCORD LX SEDAN FROM BLOOMFIELD HONDA IN BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN ONE YEAR AGO.*AK    MY WIFE WAS REAR ENDED BY A LARGE FORD TRUCK WHILE SHE WAS STOPPED TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ONTO A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  I TRUCK DIDN\u0019T EVEN BRAKE AND DROVE THE TRUCK ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BACKSEAT.  LUCKILY SHE WAS WEARING A SEAT BELT.  HER DRIVER SEAT, HOWEVER, BROKE OFF IT\u0019S \u001cMOORINGS\u001d AT THE FLOORBOARD GIVING HER NO SUPPORT AS SHE WAS FLUNG BACKWARD IN THE CRASH.  IT WAS LIKE THE FRONT SEAT WAS A ROCKING CHAIR AFTER THE CRASH.  NO PART OF THE FRONT END WAS DAMAGE EXCEPT THE DRIVER SEAT (ONLY THE REAR END HAD BEEN STRUCK).  THE TRUNK AND REAR-END ARE DESTROYED.   ARE DRIVER\u0019S SEATS SUPPOSED TO COME LOOSE OR BREAK OFF IN CRASHES???  IS THIS THE HONDA WAY?  WE HAVE OWNED HONDA\u0019S FOR YEARS AND THIS IS A MAJOR QUALITY BREECH AND A DANGER.  IF MY WIFE WASN\u0019T WEARING THAT SEAT BELT SHE MIGHT BE DEAD.      THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP SAID THIS SOMETIMES HAPPENED IN THE HONDA ACCORD IN REAR END COLLISIONS...THIS IS ACCEPTABLE????    THE DRIVER\u0019S SEAT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HER INTO THE DASH.

ON A EXIT OUT OF A SHOPPING CENTER I REGULARLY GO TO (TERRA NOVA SHOPPING CENTER ON EAST H IN CHULA VISTA, CALIFORNIA) THE CAR IN DRIVE STARTED TO ROLL BACK AFTER THE BRAKE WAS RELEASED AS TRAFFIC STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE VEHICLE FROM CONTINUING TO REVERSE IN FREE FALL AND STRIKE ANOTHER CAR IN THE REAR IT WAS NECESSARY TO SLAM THE ACCELERATOR DOWN TO REGAIN FORWARD MOTION.  AFTER I GOT HOME I CALLED MY DEALER (TIPTON HONDA IN EL CAJON, CALIFORNIA) AND ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS INFORMED ME THAT A SLIGHT ROLLBACK WAS NORMAL IN SMALL CARS BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS.  I THEN CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS A DEGREE IN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING AND HE TOLD ME THAT ROLLBACK IS NOT NORMAL ON ANY CAR; THERE IS A BRAKE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO ACTIVATE IN THE TRANSMISSION TO PREVENT THIS WHEN THEN THE CAR IS STOPPED.    I THEN BEGAN TO CONTACT OTHER LOCAL HONDA DEALERS,  BALL HONDA IN NATIONAL CITY, CONNECTED ME TO A TECHNICIAN WHO SAID THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS ON EMISSIONS (VTEC ULEV) IN CALIFORNIA THE TIMING HAD TO BE ALTERED WHICH DOES RESULT IN SOME ROLLBACK.     THE NEXT WEEK I TALKED TO LATEEFAH FROM HONDA (CASE NO. 12002-12-300-1175) AND SHE OTHER CUSTOMERS HAD REPORTED THIS AND HONDA WAS AWARE OF IT BUT THE ENGINE WAS DESIGNED TO MEET SPECS AND THEY WOULD NEVER SELL AN UNSAFE CAR.  SHE STATED A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED AND SAID THAT THE DEALER SHOULD BE HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT IT  SHE STATED THAT ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS MOVE YOUR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE TO THE ACCELERATOR.  AFTER I TALKED TO HONDA I TRIED THE CAR ON MY UNCLE'S DRIVEWAY AND WE FOUND THAT IT ROLLED BACK WHICH HIS CAR DOES NOT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE IT WOULD STOP EXCEPT WHEN IT LEVELED OUT.

A LOT OF MANUFACTURES HAVE GONE TO USING RED TURN SIGNALS THAT ALSO SERVE AS BRAKE LIGHTS.  THE PROBLEM I HAVE, AND I'M SURE THIS HAS CAUSED ACCIDENTS, IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS INDICATING A TURN 90% OF THE TIME THEY MUST BRAKE TO DO SO.  BUT THE ACT OF BRAKING OBSCURES THE TURN INDICATOR.  WHEN ONE TURNS THEY DROP A LOT MORE SPEED THEN SOMEONE BRAKING WITH TRAFFIC.  THE UNIFORMLY RED TURN/BRAKE LIGHT ASSEMBLIES CAN CAUSE CONFUSION AMONG DRIVERS BEHIND THE TURNING VEHICLE AND LEAD TO MISINTERPRETATION OF THE DRIVERS\u0012 INTENTION AND LEAD TO ACCIDENTS.  HAS ANY STUDY BEEN DONE INVOLVING REAR-END ACCIDENTS INVOLVING TURNING VEHICLES?  THERE IS PROBABLY A HIGHER % INVOLVING VEHICLES WITH RED REAR-TURN SIGNALS.  I\u0012M HOPING THAT THE NHTSA WILL PERFORM A STUDY REGARDING RED TURN SIGNALS AND PROPOSE NEW REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE AUTOMAKERS TO USE YELLOW LENSES FOR ALL REAR-TURN SIGNALS.  ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THEM IS WHEN THE VEHICLES HAZARD LIGHTS ARE ON.  HAVING BLINKING YELLOW LIGHTS WILL ALERT DRIVERS MUCH QUICKER TO THE PRESENCE OF A DISABLED VEHICLE THAN BLINKING RED LIGHTS.  THE RED LIGHTS WILL BLEND IN WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE BRAKING TO SLOW DUE TO THE HAZARD.  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ MY QUESTION, IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT DEPARTMENT FOR SUCH A COMPLIANT/SUGGESTION, CAN YOU PLEASE FORWARD IT TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONAL.  COULD YOU ALSO NOTIFY ME OF THE PROPER DEPARTMENT AND ITS CONTACT INFORMATION FOR MAKING SUCH SUGGESTIONS?  THANKS.  *AK",

ON SATURDAY, DEC. 15, 2001 HE ALONG WITH 3 OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE IN THE CAR ON THE FREEWAY.  THEY WERE TRAVELING IN THE FAST LANE AT AROUND 70 MILES PER HOUR., ANOTHER CAR GOING THE SAME DIRECTION LOST CONTROL (REASON UNKNOWN), SPUN OUT ACROSS THE FREEWAY, HIT THE CENTER DIVIDER AND STOPPED DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF OUR SON.  NATURALLY HE HIT HIS BRAKES, BUT IT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO EXCEPT HIT THE OTHER CAR HEAD-ON AT ABOUT 60 MILES PER HOUR.  ALL FOUR OF THE PARTIES IN OUR CAR WERE WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS, WHICH PROBABLY SAVED THEIR LIVES.  HOWEVER, THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  IT IS A MIRACLE THAT SOMEONE WASN'T SEVERLY INJURED.  WHILE ALL OF THE PARTIES HAD SOME WHIP LASH, NO ONE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.  SOMEONE TOLD MY SON THAT BECAUSE HE HIT HIS BRAKES THE FRONT END OF OUR HONDA WAS LOWERED AND WENT UNDERNEATH THE BUMPER OF THE CAR THEY HIT, WHICH WAS A LARGER SUV AND THATS WHY THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY.  I THOUGHT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED ON IMPACT TO PROVIDE THE PROTECTION THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE.  THE POLICE REPORT INDICATED THAT THE DRIVER OF THE SUV WHO SPUN OUT WAS AT FAULT.  WHILE WE ARE REALLY GLAD THAT OUR SON AND HIS FRIENDS WERE NOT SEVERLY INJURED I HAVE CONCERN FOR SOMEONE ELSE WHO MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY.  I HOPE THIS INFORMATION IS HELPFUL.  I DID CONTACT HONDA MOTOR CARS TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  ABOUT ALL THEY DID WAS TAKE MY INFORMATION, SEND ME INFORMATION ON AIRBAGS AND TELL ME TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  SHOULD YOU LIKE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GIVE US A CALL.  THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.  *AK",
