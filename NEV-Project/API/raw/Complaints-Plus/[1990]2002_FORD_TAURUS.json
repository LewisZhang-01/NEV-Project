THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES..    I HAD THE LIGHT SENSOR REPLACED BUT NO CHANGE.   AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, THE CAUSE IS MOST LIKELY THE AUTOMATIC HEADLAMP RELAY, WHICH IS NOT REPLACEABLE, AS IT IS BURIED BEHIND THE FUSE BOX, AND EXCESSIVE COST (>$300)  TO REPLACE.  I FEEL FORD SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL, BECAUSE IT APPEARS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FORD VEHICLES.  APPARENTLY THE RELAY USED TO ENERGIZE THE HEADLIGHTS IN \"AUTOMATIC \" MODE IS NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE CURRENT, AND I SUSPECT, BURNS OUT AND BECOMES UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT.   THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT FEATURE, (WHEN IT WORKS) IS A GREAT SAFETY ADVANCEMENT, AS MANY DRIVERS FAIL TO TURN ON HEADLIGHTS AT DUSK, THEREFORE THE AUTOMATIC ON FEATURE GREATLY IMPROVES VISIBILITY OF ONCOMING VEHICLES AT DUSK AND EARLY EVENING.    SINCE IT IS NOT PREDICABLE WHEN THE LIGHTS WILL FAIL, MANY PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE AUTOMATIC ON/OFF FEATURE, PREFERRING TO SWITCH TO MANUAL ON/OF ONLY WHEN AUTOMATIC FAILS.

WHILE RETURNING HOME VIA I-75 IN MIDDLE GEORGIA, THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY FAILED. WHILE TRAVELING AT 70 MPH, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY INCREASED TO OVER 6000 RPM. I IMMEDIATELY LET OFF THE GAS AND LOOKED IN THE REAR VIEW TO SEE WHITE SMOKE BOILING FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR. AFTER SAFELY GETTING THE CAR OFF THE INTERSTATE, I RAISED THE HOOD TO SEE TRANSMISSION FLUID ALL OVER THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE. IT'S SIMPLY A MIRACLE THE CAR DID NOT CATCH FIRE. I WAITED FOR TWO HOURS IN 100 DEGREE HEAT BEFORE A TOW TRUCK ARRIVED. AFTER BEING TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME AND I QUOTE, \"WE SEE A LOT OF TAURUS TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS LIKE THIS AT AROUND 120,000 MILES.\" IF THIS IS SO, WHY CAN'T FORD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM? I REALIZE THE CAR HAS SOME AGE ON IT, BUT THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THIS. SINCE DAY ONE, I HAVE \"BABIED\" THIS CAR AND HAVE NEVER ONCE ABUSED IT IN ANY WAY. I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN IT RECKLESSLY AND HAVE ALWAYS SERVICED IT ON REGULAR INTERVALS. THIS CAR HAS BEEN IN MY SHOP FOR OVER 3 YEARS BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET IT REPAIRED. I WISH FORD WOULD MAN UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS. HOWEVER, I CERTAINLY WON'T HOLD MY BREATH. \"HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FORD LATELY?\" I HAVEN'T.    *TR",

THEN, ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 16TH WE RECEIVED AN AUTOMATED CALL FROM SANDY SPRINGS FORD ABOUT THE RECALL. DOES FORD HAVE ANY IDEA IN THE ACT OF NEGLIGENCE THEY HAVE CREATED? THERE COULD HAVE BEEN FATALITIES. OUR CAR IS STILL AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP - IT IS STALLING OUT AND THE BRAKES WERE NOT THE SAME (CHARGED US TO FIX THEM).

AS POSSIBLE BACKGROUND, WE HAD A COLD SNAP RECENTLY WHERE THE TEMP GOT DOWN TO SINGLE DIGITS. MY DAUGHTER'S TAURUS WAS PARKED BESIDE OUR GARAGE.

THE JAGGED END OF THE SPRING WAS PROTRUDING INTO THE INNER SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE, HAVING CAUSED IT TO RAPIDLY DEFLATE.  THE MECHANIC THEN INFORMED ME THAT THE SMELL I EXPERIENCED WAS MOST LIKELY THE BROKEN SPRING RUBBING ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE.

I STOPPED THE CAR AND LOOKED UNDER THE CAR TO CHECK FOR OBSTRUCTIONS. I THEN TURNED THE CAR AROUND AND BACKED IT BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY. I BEGAN TO PULL FORWARD SLOWLY, ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE IF THE NOISE WAS FROM THE BRAKE. AT THAT POINT THE TIRE BLEW, AND THE WAS A LOUD POP. UPON REMOVING THE TIRE, I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE  COIL AROUND THE STRUT HAD EMBEDDED ITSELF INTO THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE, AND TORE A RING ALL THE WAY AROUND. IT LOOKS AS IF I TRIED TO OPEN THE TIRE WITH A CAN OPENER. AFTER REMOVING THE STRUT AND THE COIL, I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT A PIECE OF THE COIL HAD SNAPPED OFF UP NEAR THE TOP. AFTER LOOKING AT THE POINT OF THE BREAK, I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO EROSION, OR RUSTING. THE MECHANIC WHO IS REPAIRING THE STRUT IS QUITE STUNNED, AS IS EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE TIRE, AND THE COIL. APPARENTLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING IS QUITE RARE. IN FACT, THEY ALL HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING. I AM GRATEFUL THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN AS WE WERE DRIVING ON THE ROAD. YESTERDAY EVENING THE CAR WAS FINE, AND NOT MAKING ANY OF THE GRINDING NOISE AT ALL.  *TR",

THE MOMENT THE CAR BEGAN TO MOVE, I HEARD A LOUD \"BANG\" SOUND AND THEN THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE ANYMORE.  I GOT OUT AND SAW THAT THE FRONT TIRE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WAS FLAT.   I CHECKED THE TIRE AND FOUND THAT IT HAD BEEN SLASHED BY THE SPRING THAT HAD JUST BROKEN.  I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP.  THE MECHANIC SAID THAT WHEN THE COIL SPRING BROKE IT DAMAGED THE SWAY BAR LINK AS WELL AS CUTTING UP MY TIRE.  BOTH FRONT COIL SPRINGS, 1 SWAY BAR LINK, AND 1 TIRE HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM.  THERE IS A RECALL ON THE 1999 - 2001 TAURUS, BUT NOT THE 2002.  FORD IS BEING VERY NEGLIGENT BY NOT EXTENDING THE RECALL TO THE 2002 TAURUS.  IT IS UNFAIR THAT I, AND MANY OTHERS ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR REPAIRS THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY FAULTY PARTS.  THE ONLY THING I AM GRATEFUL FOR IS THAT THIS HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND NOT WHILE I WAS TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY.  BY IGNORING THIS PROBLEM AND NOT EXTENDING THE RECALL, FORD IS NOT ONLY CAUSING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS FOR CUSTOMERS, THEY ARE ALSO ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF MANY PEOPLE.  PLEASE DO WHAT YOU CAN TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION OF FAULTY COIL SPRINGS ON THE FORD TAURUS.",

IT SCRAPED INTO THE TIRE UNTIL IT PIERCED THROUGH THE SIDEWALL.  THANK HEAVENS THIS DID NOT HAPPEN AT 70MPH    I HAVE READ ABOUT THE PRIOR RECALL INVOLVING THESE SAME PARTS ON THE 2001 AND EARLIER FORD TAURUS MODELS AND ON 2003 AND EARLIER FORD FOCUS MODELS WHICH USE THE SAME PARTS. HOW IN GOOD FAITH COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT THESE PARTS WERE GOING TO JUST DISAPPEAR FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. FORD CONTINUED TO USE THESE PARTS UNTIL THEY WERE GONE AND JUST ROLLED THE DICE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT BY YOUR AGENCY.  YOU MUST HELP THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE DRIVING VARIOUS MODELS OF FORDS WITH THESE SAME PARTS    THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY, VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE FORD SPRINGS.    THE EVENTS THAT LEAD UP TO THE REAR SPRINGS BEING DEFECTIVE WERE A THUMP WHEN THE R/R SPRING BROKE AND THE CAR DROPPED A LITTLE BIT.

I CAN'T EVEN TURN MY DEFROSTER ON BECAUSE OF THE BLOWER FAN MOTOR THAT GOT SHORTED OUT FROM THE WATER LEAK. I USE A RAG NOW TO WIPE THE MOISTURE AWAY WITH ONE HAND AND DRIVE WITH THE OTHER.

I THOUGHT THAT I HAD JUST LEFT MY WINDOW SLIGHTLY CRACKED THE FIRST FEW TIMES THERE WAS WATER ON MY FLOOR BOARD. THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED THE WATER LEAKING IN WAS WHEN I HAD A PASSENGER IN MY CAR AND THE WATER SQUIRTED ONTO HIS FOOT AS I WAS BACKING DOWN MY DRIVEWAY ON A CLEAR DAY. THAT MEANS THAT THE WATER COLLECTS SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE GLOVE BOX AND UNDER THE DASHBOARD, AFTER A STEADY RAIN, AND WHEN THE DEGREE OF MY CAR CHANGES THE WATER COMES POURING IN. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED. THERE WAS A STEADY STEAM OF WATER FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS, ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS OF WATER TOTAL. I HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN AT LEAST 3 TIMES WITH VARYING AMOUNTS OF WATER.  TO CORRECT THIS FAILURE, I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THAT MY MODEL OF CAR HAD BEEN RECALLED IN 2003 FOR A LOOSE WINDSHIELD MOUNT THAT COULD LET WATER LEAK IN. BUT WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID THAT MY VIN WASN'T UP FOR ANY RECALLS. SO, SOMEHOW MY CAR GOT LEFT OFF THE LIST OF RECALLED CARS. THEY REFUSED TO FIX IT SINCE IT WASN'T IN THE COMPUTER TO BE FIXED, MEANING THEY WOULDN'T GET PAID.  ALSO, MY REAR WINDSHIELD CREAKS WHEN I AM DRIVING WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS AFFECTED TOO.

UPON ACCELERATING TO EXIT MY DRIVEWAY, MY RIGHT FRONT COIL SPRING BROKE IN TWO PUNCTURING MY BRAND NEW TIRE.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER BEFORE THE STEERING LOCKED . I HAVE SPOKEN TO BOTH A FORD DEALERSHIP AND TO FORD'S CUSTOMER RELATIONS CENTER. THEY STATED THAT FORD IS STILL COLLECTING DATA AS TO WHETHER TO EXTEND THE 1999 - 2001 RECALL OF THE DEFECTIVE FRONT SUSPENSION COIL SPRINGS TO INCLUDE THE 2002 TAURUS. ACCORDING TO FORD THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM EXISTING IN  MODEL YEARS AFTER 2001 TAURUS & SABLES. FORD HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTY COVERAGE OF THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS  UP TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR 150,000 MILES. BUT IT IS VIN NUMBER SPECIFIC. THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECTIVE PART.  FOR THE SPRING TO BREAK / FRACTURE AT THE BASE AND FOR THE SPRING TO UNSCREW FROM THE SPRING SEAT,  PUNCTURING THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE. CAUSING IMMEDIATE & SUDDEN LOSS OF TIRE PRESSURE AND CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  FORD STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A DEFECT OR SAFETY ISSUE. WHAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL MY CAR?  DID I NEED TO HAVE BEEN INJURED OR WORSE FOR FORD TO TAKE NOTICE? THAT THIS PROBLEM STILL EXISTS! AS A SIDE NOTE;  WHEN I FINALLY RETIRED MY 1991 OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS IN LATE 2007 WITH OVER 250,000 MILES IT STILL HAD IT'S ORIGINAL SPRINGS?  AND THEY WERE STILL IN GOOD CONDITION.  NOW I AM FACED WITH A REPAIR BILL THAT IS 1,200.00.  WHICH IS THE OVER INFLATED COST AT THE DEALERSHIP AND INFERIOR PLASTIC PARTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY A LIFETIME WARRANTY. *TR",

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION,  THE PROBLEM ENDED UP THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT SUSPENSION COIL SPRING FRACTURED AND PUNCTURED MY FRONT DRIVER SIDE TIRE, RUINING IT.

THE PROBLEM SET ME BACK CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WAS GRATEFUL THAT THE PROBLEM HAPPENED ON THE APPROACH OF MY DRIVEWAY, NOT ON THE FREEWAY THAT I WAS HEADING TO.

WITH SOME ADDITIONAL HELP I DID FINALLY GET A JACK UNDER & GOT THE TIRE OFF TO SEE A HUGE TEAR IN IT. I THEN NOTICED THE BROKEN COIL SPRING. I CONTACTED FORD ABOUT THE BROKEN COIL SPRING BECAUSE I HAD AN OLDER TAURUS THAT FORD HAD RECALLED FOR THE DEFECTIVE COIL SPRINGS. ALL THE FORD GARAGES SAID THAT THEIR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN & I WOULD HAVE TO CALL THEM BACK. I CONTACTED THE GARAGE AT THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM FOR A REPAIR & THEY CHECKED WITH FORD & SAID THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THAT YEAR. I GOT THE FRONT COIL SPRING REPLACED ALONG WITH THE STRUT THAT WAS BROKEN IN THE PROCESS OF THE SPRING BREAKING & AS THE DEALER WAS CHECKING THE CAR THEY SAID THAT THE REAR COIL SPRING WAS ALSO BROKEN SO I HAD THEM REPLACE THAT ALONG WITH THE STRUT. I HAVE TALKED TO A FEW OTHER TAURUS OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM ALSO. WHY HAS FORD NEVER FIXED THIS PROBLEM? IS IT GOING TO TAKE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING FATALLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT THIS?  *TR",

THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON THIS TAURUS IS: XXXXXXXXXXXX    I WAS BACKING MY FORD OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 11TH AND AS I WAS TURNING THE WHEEL TO EXIT, A LOUD CRACK SOUNDED AND THE ENTIRE LEFT SIDE OF MY CAR DROPPED. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOP. THE NEXT DAY THE MECHANIC DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE COIL SPRINGS HAD RUSTED COMPLETELY AND SNAPPED. THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE SECOND COIL SPRING WAS IN THE SAME CONDITION, SO THEY REPLACED BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. THE TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIR WAS $1,580.83.    AS MENTIONED IN THE RECALL, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY LIABILITY, AND I AM VERY THANKFUL THIS OCCURRED IN A PARKING LOT AND NOT ON THE FREEWAY TO OR FROM WORK.    FOR A CAR BEING ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD IT IS HARD TO COMPREHEND THAT THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A MAINTENANCE ITEM BY FORD.

SHE THEN CALLED STEVE AT STARKEY FORD AND HE TOLD HER THE SAME THING, THAT FORD RECOMMENDS THE CHANGING OF BOTH SPRINGS. I FEEL FORD CORP IS RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE THERE IS A HISTORY OF DEFECTIVE SPRINGS BOTH FRONT AND REAR OF WHICH OUR CAR HAS HAD BOTH HAPPEN IN 1 YEAR.

I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THE 1999, 2000, AND 2001 ; THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL.

ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 26, 2007 I WAS GETTING ON THE ON-RAMP OF A HIGHWAY WHEN I HEARD A LOUD BANG FROM THE FRONT END OF MY CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY LOST STEERING AND PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAMP.  I CHECKED MY FRONT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE, WHICH APPEARED INTACT, AND GOT BACK IN MY CAR TO TRY TO GET TO A SAFER PLACE TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE NOISE WAS.  AS SOON AS I STARTED MOVING, MY FRONT LEFT TIRE LET ALL THE AIR OUT OF IT, AND A PIECE OF METAL FELL FROM MY CAR ONTO THE ROAD (WHICH I PICKED UP OFF THE ROADWAY).     AFTER I GOT TO A SAFER PLACE (BY CREEPING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN MY CAR), I LOOKED AT MY FRONT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE AND IT WAS COMPLETELY SHREDDED AND FALLING OFF THE RIM.  THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE COIL SPRING HAD SNAPPED AND SHREDDED MY TIRE.  THE PIECE OF METAL THAT FELL OFF MY CAR WAS A PIECE OF THE COIL SPRING.  IF IT HAD HAPPENED 20 SECONDS LATER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY GOING AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED, WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT, POSSIBLY INJURING OR KILLING MYSELF OR OTHERS.     I GOT ONLINE AND RESEARCHED 2002 FORD COIL SPRING RECALLS.  APPARENTLY THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AS THERE WERE COUNTLESS ACCOUNTS OF THIS HAPPENING IN 2002 TAURUS'.  FORD HAD RECALLED THE FAULTY COIL SPRINGS IN 1999 TO 2001 MODELS, BUT NOT 2002 MODELS.  THE PIECE OF COIL SPRING THAT FELL OFF MY CAR WAS SHEARED RIGHT THROUGH, BUT WASN'T RUSTED OR PITTED AT ALL.       I CONTACTED FORD, AND THEY WILL NOT FIX THE FAULTY 2002 MODEL COIL SPRINGS AT THEIR EXPENSE.  I HAVE TO PAY THEM ALMOST $750 TO GET THIS FIXED.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE, AS PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH, AS I WAS.  FORD IS NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING THIS IS EVEN AN ISSUE, AND PEOPLE DO NOT EVEN KNOW THERE IS A DANGER.       SIMPLY GOOGLE \"2002 FORD TAURUS COIL SPRING RECALL\" TO READ HOW COMMON THIS PROBLEM IS.  PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT THEIR LIVES MAY BE IN DANGER EVERY TIME THEY DRIVE THEIR CAR.",

I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE AT THIS TIME AND NEED MY VEHICLE.  *TR",

RAIN FLOWS INTO THIS AREA AND PASSES INTO THE HEATER DUCTING.  SOME OF THIS WATER FLOWS INTO THE PLASTIC HOUSING FOR THE BLOWER MOTOR CAUSING EARLY FAILURE.    POTENTIAL HAZARD: EARLY FAILURE OF THE MOTOR MAY RESULT IN THE INABILITY OF THE VEHICLE HEATING SYSTEM TO REMOVE CONDENSATION FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE WINDSHIELD.

PROBLEM: THE BLOWER MOTOR IS LOCATED UNDER THE RIGHT HAND DASHBOARD HOUSED IN A MOLDED PLASTIC ASSEMBLY.  THIS LOCATION IS ONE OF THE LOWEST POINTS IN THE HEATING SYSTEM THEREFORE WATER ACCUMULATES IN THE MOTOR HOUSING PLASTIC ASSEMBLY SUBMERGING THE REAR ONE-THIRD OF THE MOTOR IN WATER.  THIS RESULTS IN EARLY FAILURE OF THE MOTOR DUE TO WATER CONTAMINATION, AS THERE IS NOT A PROVISION TO DRAIN WATER FROM THE PLASTIC HOUSING.    COMMENTS: THIS IS A KNOWN ENGINEERING DEFECT AS FORD SEALED THE HOUSING WITH A RUBBERIZED COMPOUND TO PREVENT WATER FROM THE HEATING SYSTEM FLOWING ONTO THE FLOOR.    CORRECTIVE ACTION: MANDATE FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO RECALL THE 2002 FORD TAURUS AND OTHER YEARS AND MODELS WITH A SIMILAR SYSTEM TO INSTALL A DRAIN IN THE HEATER MOTOR PLASTIC HOUSING IN ORDER TO DRAIN THE WATER FROM THE ASSEMBLY.

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE  FRONT LEFT TIRE DEFLATED.  I THOUGHT THAT THE EXPLOSIVE TYPE NOISE WAS EXCESSIVELY HIGH .  ALSO, THOUGHT T I   HAD A BAD TIRE THAT BLEW OUT.   I CALLED AAA TO CHANGE MY TIRE THAT EVENING,AND   AAA MECHANIC REALIZED HE COULD NOT GET THE TIRE OFF THE CAR AND LOOKED UNDER  WITH FLASHLIGHT TO SEE WHY. HE SAID THAT HE REASON HE COULD NOT GET THE TIRE OFF THE CAR WAS BECASUE THE SPRING BROKE AND WAS EMBEDDED INTO THE FRONT TIRE. HE HANDED ME THE TOP OF THE SPRING THAT WAS BROKEN.  *AK    UPON THE ORDEAL FO GETTING CAR OUT OFGARAGE AND TO FORD MUZI DEALERSHIP/SERVICE DEPARTMENT,  I WAS  INFORMED BY THE SEVERAL OF THE FLATBED DRIVERS THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM  WITH FORD TAURUS AND THEY HAD SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE. I WAS FURTHER INFORMED BY THE DRIVERS THAT FORD HAD RECALLED OTHER YEARS OF THIS MODEL. ONE HE DRIVER SAID  HE HAD ONE INSTANCE OF A 2002 MODEL ON THE HIGHWAY ALSO., I CONSULTED WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FORD TAURUS AND THAT OTHER YEARS WERE RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT NOT THE 2002.    UPON REVIEW OF THE NHTS INFORMATION THE 1999 , 2000 , AND 2001 FORD TAURUS SEDANS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THE EXACT SAME THING THAT HAS JUST HAPPENED TO MY CAR. THIS IS INDEED A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM WITH THIS 2002 FORD TAURUS AND MOST DEFINELY COULD HAVE CAUSED MY DEATH AS WELL AS OTHERS IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY, OR ANYWHERE ELSE.WITH FAST SPEEDS I AM SURE THIS CAR WOULD HAVE TURNED OVER INSTANTANEOUSLY AS IT HAPPENDED SO FAST, A MATTER OF LESS THAN 1-2 MINUTES FOR THE TIRE TO DELFATE.  I HOPE THAT YOUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PROMPTLY BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT THIS CAN AND WILL HAPPENED TO OTHER OWNERS OF THIS 2002 FORD TAURUS PASSENGER SEDAN",

FORD RECALL NO. 04S17 DISCUSSED THIS POTENTIAL FAILURE AND COVERED MODEL YEARS 1999-2001 FOR FORD TAURUS AND MERCURY SABLE.   I HAVE A 2002 FORD TAURUS, AND MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL.  I CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE AND ASKED TO HAVE MY VEHICLE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THEY DENIED MY REQUEST.  SINCE THE PROBLEM  DISCUSSED IN THE RECALL NOTICE APPEARED  TO CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE FOR 2002 FORD TAURUS VEHICLES, I BELIEVE THAT THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER 2002 FORD TAURUS.  MY CONCERN INCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS OCCURRING ON THE OTHER FRONT SPRING AS WELL AS THE SUDDEN WAY IN WHICH THIS HAPPENED, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS OF CONTROL.  *AK",

MY TIRE WAS LESS THAN ONE YEAR OLD.  I WENT TO GET A NEW TIRE AS IT COULD NOT BE FIXED.  I WENT TO PUT THE NEW TIRE ON WHEN I REALIZED THE COIL SPRING HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF AND THAT WAS WHAT PUNCTURED MY TIRE.  I COULD NOT PUT THE NEW TIRE ON BECAUSE OF THE NOW BROKEN COIL SPRING.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR WITH THE SPARE ON AS THE SPARE WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO BE PUNCTURED BY THE POINTED EDGE OF THE BROKEN SPRING.  I AM UNEMPLOYED SO I HAD TO SEARCH FOR THE CHEAPEST WAYS TO FIX THIS.  I FOUND A NEW TIRE AT BELLE FOR $68.90 AND I GOT THE SPRING AND SWAY BAR LINK REPLACED FOR $398.91.  BEFORE GETTING MY CAR FIXED, I DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON FORD TAURUS' BETWEEN 1999-2001 FOR THE COIL SPRINGS.  I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH 2002 TAURUS' WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR COIL SPRINGS.  I AM NOW VERY DISCOURAGED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY CAR.  I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT THAT MAY CAUSE INJURY TO MYSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE.  IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN ON A FREEWAY, MY LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER.  I HOPE THAT THE COIL SPRINGS ARE RECALLED SO THAT I CAN GET THE REMAINING COIL SPRINGS REPLACED AND THEN I COULD FEEL SAFER WHEN I AM DRIVING.  I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT THE 2002'S SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF TAURUS RECALLS.  THIS HAPPENED AS I WAS BACKING OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT NOT WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  THIS INDICATES THAT IT IS A COIL SPRING FAILURE AND NO FAULT OF MY OWN.  THESE COIL SPRINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FAIL AND POSSIBLY ENDANGER LIVES.  I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE A RESPONSE TO THIS SUBMISSION.  THANK YOU SINCERELY.  [XXX].   *NM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I LIVE IN A SALTY AREA IN THE WINTER, BUT I CLEAN THE UNDERSIDE OF MY CAR OFTEN. IT IS MY DAILY DRIVER AND THE CAR NOW HAS 41,000 MILES ON IT, ALL HIGHWAY. ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO, I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD , GOING AROUND A CORNER AT ABOUT 35 MPH WHEN MY CAR MADE A LOUD SNAP NOISE FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL. I PULLED OVER AND EXAMINED THE CAR, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE ALRIGHT. THE REAR END WAS SLIGHTLY SAGGING, BUT TAURUS' ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LOW BACK ENDS.. I FIGURED I CAN OVER A STICK AT A FUNNY ANGLE OR SOMETHING. ABOUT A WEEK LATER, LAST THURSDAY, THE CAR MADE THE NOISE AGAIN, THIS TIME IT SOUNDED LIKE THE WHOLE CAR MADE THE NOISE, AND I COULD FEEL IT IN THE STEERING WHEEL.    I PULLED THE CAR OVER AGAIN, GOT OUT, AND THE CAMBER ON BOTH OF THE REAR WHEELS WAS ON THE TOES (THE TOP WAS BENT IN), AND THE REAR END WAS SO LOW I COULDN'T FIT A FINGER IN BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE FENDER AND THE WHEEL. I DROVE 1 MILE HOME, JACKED THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL UP, AND WHEN I TOOK THE WHEEL OFF TO MY SURRPRISE THE SPRING WAS ALL RUSTED AND IT HAD SNAPPED. THE JAGGED EDGE WAS LITERALLY CENTIMETERS FROM MY TIRE, THANK GOD IT DID NOT HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY OR IT MAY HAVE PUNCTURED THE TIRE AND CAUSED A BLOWOUT. I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED. I PUT THE WHEEL BACK ON, TOOK THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL OFF, AND AGAIN THE SPRING WAS SNAPPED IN TWO. THIS SIDE, AT THE SNAP THE JAGGED EDGE NEXT TO THE TIRE WAS RUSTED, SO THIS SPRING MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO SNAP. I WAS DRIVING WITH A BROKEN SPRING WHICH NEARLY PUNCTURED MY REAR TIRE FOR OVER A WEEK.  BOTH REAR SPRINGS BROKE, THEY WERE CLEARLY DEFECTIVE AND THEY MUST BE RECALLED. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE, A REAR SPRING ON A TAURUS TO SNAP ON THE HIGHWAY, CAUSE A BLOWOUT, AND KILL SOMEBODY? ACTIONS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  *NM",

I SEE ANOTHER COMPLAINT FOR THIS AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR TWO REASONS, 1 BEING THAT IT COULD EASILY CAUSE A FIRE IN THE CAR (ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE PAPERS UNDER THE SEAT) WHICH ON TOP OF THAT COULD CAUSE A CRASH, AND 2 IF THE DRIVER WENT TO FIND THE LIGHTER SO IT DIDN'T CAUSE A FIRE NOT ONLY WOULD HE/SHE GET BURNED WHILE DRIVING BUT IT COULD ALSO CAUSE A CRASH WHICH ALMOST HAPPENED TO ME.  AND JUST SO FORD KNOWS, I AM HOLDING THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY BURNED FINGER.*JB",

MY WIFE TRIED TO GET HIM OUT AND FINALLY HAD TO USE SCISSORS FROM A NEARBY BUSINESS TO CUT THE SEAT BELT.  OUR OWN INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT IF YOU PULL ANY OF THE SEATBELTS OUT TO THE MAXIMUM AND THEN LET IT RETRACT, THE SEAT BELT CAN NOT BE RE-EXTENDED UNTIL THE SEAT BELT HAS BEEN FULLY RETRACTED.  FROM WHAT WE COULD DISCERN WAS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO MANUALLY RELEASE THE SEATBELT WHEN IT IS IN THIS \"MODE\".

THOUGH THIS IS GREAT FOR CHILD SEATS, IT COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN (AND MAYBE SOME DISABLED PEOPLE) UNLESS THERE IS A MANUAL RELEASE MECHANISM FOR THAT SEATBELT.
