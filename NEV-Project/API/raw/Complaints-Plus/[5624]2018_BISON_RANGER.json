        "summary": "TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 BISON RANGER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE WIRING AT THE GOOSENECK HITCH HAD BECOME UNDONE, THE OVEN DOES NOT FUNCTION, AND THERE WAS A FUEL ODOR INSIDE THE LIVING QUARTERS. IN ADDITION, THE REFRIGERATOR DID NOT COOL AS DESIGNED, THE SHOWER DOOR FRACTURED OFF THE HINGES, THE HYDRAULIC JACK LIFT CAUSED THE TRAILER TO SWAY IN AN UNSAFE MOTION, THERE WAS AN ABNORMAL NOISE, AND THE ELECTRIC SLIDE ON ONE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE GAUGED THE FLOOR, WHICH CAUSED A LEAK TO ENTER FROM OUTSIDE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ON MAY 21, 2018, AN UNKNOWN DEALER REPAIRED THE LEAKS AND READJUSTED THE SLIDE THAT WAS COMPLETELY DETACHED, REPAIRED SOME EXTERIOR SIDING, AND THE THERMOSTAT WAS REPLACED. ON OCTOBER 21, 2018, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO LEONARD TRUCK AND TRAILER (12800 LEONARD PKWY, NORTH JACKSON, OH 44451) TO HAVE THE BENCH REPAIRED SINCE THE RAIL THAT HELD THE SEATING FRACTURED. THE VEHICLE WAS ALSO TAKEN TO AFFORDABLE RV TRUCK & TRAILER (11016 JAMES MADISON PKWY, KING GEORGE, VA 22485) WHERE THE BRAKES WERE REPLACED, THE HOLES IN THE ROOF WERE REPAIRED, AND THE STEPS GOING INTO THE LIVING AREA WERE REPAIRED. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR TRAILER BRAKES WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL BEFORE IT WAS REPAIRED AT AFFORDABLE RV TRUCK & TRAILER. IN ADDITION, CAMPING WORLD OF WINCHESTER (190 COMMONWEALTH CT, WINCHESTER, VA 22602) REPAIRED MULTIPLE LEAKS OVER THE KITCHEN ROOF AREA. ON APRIL 19, 2019, THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE WELLS AND THE AXLE REPLACED, AND MORE LEAKS WERE SEALED. ADDITIONALLY, THE DOORS WERE SEALED AND SOME OF THE SIDING WAS REPLACED AND RABBETED. THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM PERMANENT REMEDIES; THEREFORE, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO BE INSPECTED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE CONTACT WAS CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN.",

        "summary": "DEAR FORD,  SIR I'M ELAN JUST 1 MONTH AGO BOUGHT NEW MODEL FORD RANGER 2.0L XLT + AUTOMATIC. THE SALESMAN AND GIRLS TELLING THIS MODEL IS ENGINE CAPACITY IS 2.0L AND 10 SPEED GEARBOX TRANSMISSION BETTER EFFICIENCY AND SO ON.... BUT IF I HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORDS WRITTEN THAT MY PREVIOUS MODEL FORD RANGER  T6 2.2 XLT IS MORE FUEL CONSUMPTION IS SAVE. I FILL DIESEL, FUEL TANK THE PREVIOUS MODEL CAN DRIVE UP TO 1100KM BUT THIS MODEL ONLY DRIVE 750KM.     I FIND OUT A FEW VIDEOS IN YOUTUBE FROM FORD ALSO MENTIONED IT'S SAFE FUEL CONSUMPTION AND BETTER PERFORMANCE AND MORE SAVE CONSUMPTION AND EXTRA KM. NOW AFTER BOUGHT THE NEW MODEL RANGER I FEEL YOUR GUYS CHEATING SIMPLY PROMOTE YOUR CARS WITH FALSE INFORMATION AND FAKE PUBLISHED. I NOTICED IN THIS MODEL A FEW BETTER ACCESSORIES BEEN REMOVED FROM PREVIOUS MODEL ALREADY REMOVED. JUST A MONTH THE CAR ALREADY STARTED MAKING TROUBLE AND NOW I'M IN SERVICE CENTER SINCE LOCAL TIME 9.00AM AND ALMOST BEEN WAITING MORE THAN 4 HOURS IN SERVICE CENTER. THEY STILL CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS, PLEASE THE USA FORD PROVIDED BETTER TRAINING FOR EACH SERVICE CENTER TECHNICIAN BECAUSE I'M ALSO AN ENGINEER. WHAT I NOTICED THRU MY OBSERVATION THEY'RE NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE AND LACK OF SKILL KNOWLEDGE. ESPECIALLY IN MALAYSIA ALL OF FORD SERVICE CENTER THEY TREAT THE CUSTOMER VERY POOR SERVICE AS SWITCH OFF THE AIRCOND WHILE WAITING IN THE ROOM WITH SILLY REASON, THE COFFEE VENDING MACHINE JUST WITH HOT WATER AND DONT WANT TO REFILL, NO BISCUITS PROVIDED DUE TO EVERYONE 1 WAITING MORE THAN MANY HOURS. I USE TO GO TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER THEY PROVIDED SO MANY FACILITIES. ALSO I'M WONDERING WHY EVERY SERVICE FOR FORD RANGER IN MALAYSIA VERY COSTLY IF COMPARED IN THAILAND. IF NOT NEAR FUTURE FORD WILL LOST ALL CUSTOMERS IN MALAYSIA. REALLY REGRET, DISAPPOINTED BY MISTAKENLY BUY ANOTHER TIME THE FORD RANGER.    AWAITING YOUR REPLY  THANK YOU.    ELAN",
