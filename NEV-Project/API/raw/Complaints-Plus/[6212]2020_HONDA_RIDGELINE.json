When I am backing up, it\u2019s normal and out of no where, my vehicle shuts off and it shifts back to neutral then starts to roll forward. When my truck shuts off as I\u2019m in reverse, my reverse camera becomes audio or audio off when it\u2019s suppose to show the rear camera back up.

It\u2019s a safety concern for myself, family and also the people around me driving if this happens to shut off on the freeway or even on the city road. I have my kids in the car and I could get crush from all directions if my car shuts off randomly. What do Honda need in order to fix this? My car getting crushed in an accident? Honda states they could not replicated it so I provided dash cam footage, live video footage. And still I\u2019m getting the run around. Please help.   Honda stated my after market parts caused this issue. But could not explain to me why and how it caused it?? I have a carb legal intake and an LED light strip. Nothing fancy! No harness no nothing! Just simple fuse power and ground. I\u2019ve brought my vehicle in before for this issue ( with my carb legal intake) and Honda deemed it \u201csafe and could not replicate it\u201d so I carried on and installed my LED light strip properly.  They could not explain it to me how my parts caused the issue.  So I put my car back to stock specs as they recommended. And immediately my car shuts off like I stated in this. I did not buy a Honda to have issues. At this point I\u2019m over owning this car. It\u2019s brand new! There is a bigger issue. And I feel like I am wasting my time.
