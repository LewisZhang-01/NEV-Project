CALLED DEALER, AND THEY  STATED IT  WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. THE REAR AXLE WAS PUT INTO THE WRONG SPOT, AND THEY WERE MISSING ABOUT 16 OUT RIGGERS.  THIS  CAUSED  WALLS TO BOW TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAILER. THE DOORS DIDN'T  SHUT CORRECTLY.  THERE WAS A GAPE AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR, THE CEILING COULD FALL INTO THE MAIN AREA.   THE TONGUE THAT WAS HOOKED ON THE FRONT WAS HAVING A PROBLEM.  CONSUMER CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, AND THEY SAID TO TOW  VEHICLE TO DEALER WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED ,AND THE MANUFACTURER WOULD THEN PICK IT UP.  BUT THE DEALER NO LONGER DID BUSINESS  WITH THIS MANUFACTURER.  THEN THEY WANTED CONSUMER  TO TAKE  VEHICLE FROM NORTH IDAHO TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT CONSUMER'S  EXPENSE AND RESPONSIBILITY.  *AK",
