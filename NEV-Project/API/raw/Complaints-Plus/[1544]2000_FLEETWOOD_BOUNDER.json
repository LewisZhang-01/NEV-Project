THIS PUMP IS A BOSCH VP44 PUMP AND ACCORDING TO THE CUMMINS BLOG WEBSITES AND THE FACTORY AUTHORIZED DEALER,  THIS PART HAS A 100% FAILURE RATE.  WHEN THE PUMP FAILS THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF AND DOESN'T RESTART.  MY VEHICLE IS A 25000 POUND MOTOR HOME, AND WHEN IT DIES OUT AT FREEWAY SPEEDS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.  BOSCH AND CUMMINS KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT ARE UNWILLING TO ASSIST THE CUSTOMER IN ANY WAY EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMIT THAT IT IS A DESIGN FAULT.  IN THEIR WORDS \"WE ADMIT THAT IT WASN'T OUR BEST DESIGN\".  ACCORDING TO THE BLOGS THIS IS THE ISSUE: THE MOST COMMON MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE VP44 PUMP IS RUPTURING OF THE DIAPHRAGM IN THE FRONT OF THE INJECTION PUMP. THE DIAPHRAGM RUPTURES ALLOWING THE TIMING PISTON TO VIBRATE AND DAMAGE THE FRONT COVER UNTIL FUEL BYPASSES. THIS WILL CAUSE THE DREADED CHECK ENGINE TROUBLE CODE P0216. WHEN THIS OCCURS YOUR BOSCH VP44 INJECTION PUMP MUST BE REPLACED. THE RUPTURING OF THE DIAPHRAGM IS CAUSED BY A POORLY DESIGNED LIFT PUMP. WHEN THE LIFT PUMP DOES NOT SUPPLY THE INJECTION PUMP WITH THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF FUEL PRESSURE (A MINIMUM OF 5PSI UNDER LOAD AT WIDE OPEN THROTTLE) THE DIAPHRAGM THEN DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH POSITIVE PRESSURE AND RUPTURES. DODGE HAS RECOGNIZED THIS PROBLEM AS THEY WILL NO LONGER EVEN SELL THE LIFT PUMP THAT GOES ON THE SIDE OF THE BLOCK, THEY REPLACE IT WITH A UNIT THAT IS NOW MOUNTED IN THE TANK.  I HAVE ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE BUT WAS OFFERED NOTHING.  THE COST TO CHANGE THIS PART IS OVER $3000.00 DOLLARS, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A DESIGN WHICH IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS.  HAD THIS HAPPENED 10 MILES LATER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HALF WAY UP A MOUNTAIN ROAD. ON A DIESEL MOTOR HOME WHEN THE ENGINE DIES, YOU LOOSE BRAKES, POWER EVERYTHING.",
