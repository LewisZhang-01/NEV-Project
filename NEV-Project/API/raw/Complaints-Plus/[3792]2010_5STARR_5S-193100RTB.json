I HAD TO DRIVE 800 MILES NEVER KNOWING WHEN THE CAR WOULD JUST DROP SPEED AND NOT ALLOW ME TO RECOVER TO THE NORMAL INTERSTATE SPEED AND/OR IF I WOULD BE REAR ENDED BY OTHER VEHICLES DRIVING BEHIND ME. JUST NOW I SEE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS BY OTHER 2010 NISSAN ROUGE OWNERS WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. I NEED TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES AND CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE. IT IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW AND AM THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS EVER DRIVEN IT. NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN UNTIL 7/2/15. I ACTUALLY FEARED FOR MY LIFE AND IF I'D MAKE IT HOME",
