THE ALTIMA HAD A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER INSTALLED IN 2007.  A OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WAS DONE ON THE CAR AND THE OIL TOPPED OFF AND WE WERE TOLD TO COME BACK IN 250MILES SO THEY COULD CHECK THE OIL.

I CALLED ANOTHER SHOP LOOKING FOR AT LEAST A PATCH REPLACEMENT.  PER THEIR INSPECTION, THEIR ESTIMATE IS APPROX. $700.00/$800.00, TAKING AT LEAST 1 FULL DAY TO WORK ON REPAIR.  DECIDED TO CHECK ON SIMILAR ISSUES ON-LINE AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THERE ARE MANY, MANY, MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING RUSTED FLOORBOARDS.  NISSANS' RESPONSE WAS THAT SALTED ROADS WAS THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, MANY COMPLAINTS WERE FROM STATES THAT USE SAND AND/OR IN SUNSHINE STATES.  I CALLED NISSAN, MY REFERENCE NO. 15121312. PRESENTLY CAR AT SUBURBAN TROY DEALERSHIP, AS THERE WERE RECALLS ON MY CAR.  NO WORD FROM DEALER OR NISSAN ON RUSTED FLOORBOARD ISSUE BEING REPLACED/REPAIRED.  WHAT IS NEEDED FOR ISSUING RECALLS, AS WE ALL BELIEVE PROBLEM IS FROM DEFECTED STEEL AND/OR POOR DESIGN ???  SHOULD I (AND ALL OF US) CONTACT OUR LOCAL STATE AND/OR WASHINGTON ELECTED OFFICIALS ???, AS THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT TIME TO DO SO, BEING THAT THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR !!!  I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL NOT BE A CASE OF WAITING FOR A SERIOUS INJURY AND/OR DEATH(S) TO OCCUR BEFORE CORRECTIONS TO THIS ISSUE GETS RESOLVED AND IMMEDIATE ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THESE RUSTED FLOORBOARDS.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR LOOKING INTO AND RESOLVING THE \"RUSTED FLOORBOARDS\" PROBLEMS !  *TR",

THERE WAS NO PROMISE OF THEM FIXING THE PROBLEM AT NO COST OR REIMBURSING ME THE COSTS OF HAVING AN INDEPENDENT BODY SHOP DO THE REPAIR.  NOW IT IS THE WAITING GAME.

NISSAN RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND STATED THAT THE CIRCUIT BOARD FOR CRANK/CAM SENSORS HAD FAILED. PAID $430 TO REPLACE CRANKSHAFT AND CAM/CRANK SENSORS. FAST FORWARD TO DECEMBER 2012 (~110K MILES) WHERE I EXPERIENCED THE SAME EXACT ISSUES ALONG WITH REDUCED ENGINE POWER WHEN PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR. ANOTHER LOCAL MECHANIC DETECTED THAT THE CAM/CRANK SENSORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT ABOUT RECALL #03V455000, WHICH DESCRIBES THE EXACT SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE BEEN HAVING. I CALLED THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT REPLACED THE SENSORS IN 2011 WHO SAID THAT MY VIN WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL SO I DIDN'T QUALIFY. AFTER READING THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE FOR THIS SPECIFIC YEAR/MAKE/MODEL, IT IS BEYOND ME HOW NOTHING HASN'T BEEN FLAGGED ABOUT THIS BEING AN ISSUE.

R3022 THAT STATES EXACTLY WHAT DID HAPPEN - THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE ENGINE STOPPED WITHOUT WARNING.  THE REMEDY IS THAT A DEALER REPLACE THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR.  SO, I CALLED NISSAN, FOUND THE OTHER RECALL THAT IS RELATED TO THE SENSOR, TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER (BARELY - I DROVE AND THE CAR STOPPED TWICE - AGAIN, LUCKY THERE WAS NO CRASH).  THE DEALER CALLED AND SAID HE COULD NOT FIX THIS RECALL BECAUSE THE SENSOR WAS BAD.  NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK AND PICKUP THE CAR AND PRAY AGAIN THAT I DON'T HAVE A CRASH COMING HOME.     SEEMS TOTALLY UNREASONABLE THAT NISSAN WOULD HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM - THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR - FOR, AMONG MANY OTHERS, 2002-2003 ALTIMAS AND YET THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH THESE CARS THAT NISSAN WON'T FIX.      I WAS LAID OFF AND CERTAINLY CANNOT AFFORD A $300 FIX FOR A $40 PART SO WE WILL HAVE TO DRIVE THIS DEATH CAR UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT FIXED.

GETTING OFF THE FREEWAY, MY CAR STALLED IN A BUSY INTERSECTION (ALL RED LIGHTS CAME ON AND THERE WAS NO POWER TO MY CAR).  I COULD NOT RESTART IT AND WAS STRANDED JUST PAST THE BUSY INTERSECTION NEAR THE CENTER DIVIDE.  I PUT ON MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND WAS ALMOST HIT SEVERAL TIMES, AND I AM VERY LUCKY TO NOT HAVE BEEN HURT.  AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR, PULL OVER TO THE SIDE IN A SAFER AREA AND HAD MY CAR TOWED BY AAA STRAIGHT TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP, WHO HAD PERFORMED AN OIL CHANGE ON THE CAR A DAY BEFORE.  IT TOOK THEM 2 DAYS TO FIGURE OUT THAT A POWER VALVE SCREW FAILED AND WAS SUCKED UP INTO THE ENGINE, CAUSING IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE -THE PISTON TOP, CYLINDER WALLS, SPARK PLUGS, VALVES AND CATALYST.  NISSAN RECOMMENDS A LONG BLOCK REPLACEMENT WITH NEW EXHAUST MANIFOLD WITH CONVERTER ($4500).  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH AND SPEAKING WITH THE NISSAN SERVICE MANAGER, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH ALL ALTIMAS (MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT) UNTIL THE SCREWS WERE REDESIGNED FOR THE 2006 MODEL YEAR.  I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR 2004 NISSAN SENTRAS AND 2004-2005 ALTIMAS WITH THE 2.5 L ENGINE FOR THIS REASON.  BUT THE 2003, WHICH HAS THE SAME ENGINE, WAS NOT PART OF THIS RECALL.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY NISSAN THAT SINCE I AM PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD THAT THIS IS NOT COVERED, EVEN THOUGH IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT.  I AM THANKFUL I WAS NOT HURT, AND I AM VERY UPSET THAT NISSAN KNEW ABOUT THIS DEFECT AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT FOR MY MODEL YEAR.

I CONTINUED TO DO THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND AT ABOUT 130K MILES IT STARTED TO USE EVEN MORE OIL. TOOK IT IN AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE IS GETTING OLDER AND THIS WAS NORMAL AGAIN. FAST FORWARD TO THIS YEAR. AT ABOUT 145K MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON.

SO I START DOING SOME RESEARCH AND FIND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE EXPERIENCING THESE PROBLEMS AND THAT NISSAN IS WELL AWARE THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER DISINTEGRATES IN THIS MODEL YEAR CAR, DESTROYING THE ENGINE AND LEADING TO EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION BUT REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL.

IT DEVELOPS IN MOST CARS SLOWLY OVER TIME. I AM ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT EVERY MECHANIC I WENT TO TOLD ME IT WAS NORMAL. THEN I GET ONLINE AND DO A GOOGLE SEARCH LEADING ME TO HUNDREDS OF MESSAGE BOARDS WITH PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND BEING BLOWN OFF BY NISSAN. I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY CARS.

BUT PRIOR TO LEAVING HOME I READ AT THE NHTSA WEBSITE ABOUT SIMILAR PROBLEMS I WAS ALREADY HAVING, HOPING THIS DEALERSHIP WOULD ALSO HAVE SIMILAR, IF NOT, IDENTICAL RESULTS. TO MY DISMAY, THEY HAD NEITHER. THEREBY NO TYPE OF RECALL WAS SHOWING ON MY MODEL'S HISTORY VIA THE MANUFACTURER, SO I WAS TOLD. MY VEHICLE PROBLEMS ARE AS FOLLOWS, PER DEALER DIAGNOSIS: TW CATALYST SYS-B1 (CODE P0420), ENGINE OVER TEMP (CODE P0217), AND CYL 1 MISFIRE (CODE P0301). FURTHERMORE, MY COMPLAIN ESSENTIALLY WAS ABOUT THE CAR OVER-HEATING AND TAKING LONGER THAN USUAL PERIODS TO RESTART, USUALLY UP TO 10 MINUTES. THIS DEALER SAID IT COULD COST UPWARD FROM AT LEAST $400.00 TO FIX EITHER ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH MAY STILL NOT CORRECT THEM ALL. BUT THE MOST SERIOUS WAS THE CATALYTIC PROBLEM THAT INVOLVES HOT GASES AND DEBRIS BEING DRAWN INTO THE ENGINE INSTEAD OF GOING OUT THE EXHAUST, RESULTING IN ENGINE DAMAGE. THE PROBLEMS BEGAN WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED LIT AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH STARTING DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL THE ONE YEAR POINT. JUST RECENTLY, I HAVE PURCHASED A TUNE-UP AS WELL AS A NEW BATTERY FOR MY VEHICLE IN ORDER TO REMEDY WHAT I THOUGHT WERE OWNER SERVICE ISSUES. SADLY, THIS LOCAL DEALER EITHER DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT YOUR RECALL OR SOMEBODY IS HIDING THIS FROM NOT JUST THEM BUT FROM OWNERS LIKE ME AS WELL. I PLAN TO CALL NISSAN-1 TOMORROW AS THEY WERE CLOSED AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP. I HOPE NO FIRE RESULTS FROM THIS OR ANY SERIOUS PROBLEMS RELATING TO INJURIES AS WE TRY AND RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.

I NOTICED THAT I HAD TO ADD SOME BETWEEN OIL CHANGES THIS BECAME WORSE OVER TIME AND AROUND 79K IT BECAME BAD AS IN MY WIFE CALLED ME ABOUT THE ENGINE OIL WARNING LIGHT COMING ON WHEN SHE WAS FAR AWAY FROM HOME, WE HAD TO START CHECKING THE OIL EVERY DAY. THE VEHICLE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND WE GOT OVER 170K OUT OF OUR LAST ALTIMA BEFORE WE BOUGHT THIS ONE, THAT ONE NEVER USED OIL? I DID SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PRE-CAT BREAKING DOWN AND BEING DRAWN IN THROUGH THE EGR CAUSING FAILURE OF THE ENGINE. WE TOOK THE CAR TO NISSAN AND HAD IT CHECKED AND SURE ENOUGH THAT IS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH OURS ALSO. WE HAD EXCEEDED THE MILEAGE FOR REPLACEMENT BY A FEW THOUSAND MILES. HAD WE'D BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS POSSIBLE PROBLEM YEARS AGO, THAT WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED OUR OIL CONSUMPTION AND WE COULD HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM RESOLVED BY NISSAN. WE FULLY INTENDED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER NEW ALTIMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR THIRD. I RELY ON THE VEHICLE MY WIFE DRIVES AS SHE ALSO TRANSPORTS OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND IF SHE HADN'T CALLED AND ASKED ABOUT THE RED LIGHT ON THE DASH, I BELIEVE THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE SEIZED AND LEFT HER STRANDED WITH MY FAMILY SEVERAL HOURS AWAY FROM HOME POSSIBLY PUTTING THEM IN DANGER. HOW MANY COMPLAINTS, OR WORSE, ARE NEEDED TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM?? IS NISSAN HOPING THIS WILL JUST GO AWAY??. IF AN EMISSIONS COMPONENT FAILURE IS PROVEN TO CAUSE PREMATURE ENGINE FAILURE ISN'T IT THE MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBILITY TO CORRECT IT OTHER THAN REDUCING THE TIME THE EGR IS OPEN TO LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF DEFECTIVE CATALYST DRAWN IN THE ENGINE. IN MY OPINION A WAY TO DELAY FAILURE OF THE ENGINE UNTIL THE FED 80K WARRANTY EXPIRES FOR THE CAT, THAT?S ALL THE PREVIOUS RECALL DID. ALSO THE TSB IS DECEPTIVE IT STARTS WITH THE EXTERNAL CONVERTER SHIELD THEN MUCH LATER MENTIONS INTERNAL CAT FAILURE, WERE THEY HIDING IT? SOUNDS LIKE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES TO ME. *TR",

I TOOK A TRIP TO TEXAS AND THE CAR WAS FINE FOR THE 2 1/2 WEEKS I WAS DOWN THERE. THREE DAYS BEFORE LEAVING THE SES LIGHT COME ON, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A MINOR ISSUE BEING THE FACT THAT THEY LOOK AT MY CAR WEEKEND BEFORE GOING ON MY TRIP. WHEN I HIT LOUISIANA I EXPERIENCED A JERKING BACK AND FORTH MOTION WHEN I WAS USING THE GAS. ONLY THINGS KEPT GETTING WORSE WHEN I START SEEING THE LOST OF GAS, LOST POWER IN MY CAR, AND HEARING METALLIC NOISES COMING FROM THE ENGINE. LUCKY, I MADE IT TO MY SISTER'S HOUSE IN AUGUSTA. I DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE ANYMORE DAMAGE DRIVING IT BACK TO COLUMBIA, SC SO I HAD TOW TRUCK COME AND PICK IT UP 190.00. SO THEY LOOK AT THE CAR AND CALLED ME TELLING THAT ONE OF THE POWER VALVE SCREWS CAME LOOSE AND DAMAGE TWO SPARK PLUGS. NOW THEY WANT TO REPLACE THE MANIFOLD AND MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS CRACK AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACE. THE COST OF IT WOULD BE AROUND 1350.00.

THE SES LIGHT CAME ON AND I WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR AND MAKE IT HOME AND THEN TO MY MECHANIC THE NEXT DAY.  MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE CODE READ \"CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR\".  HE REPLACED IT WITH A NISSAN PART, I PICKED UP THE CAR AND THE VEHICLE STALLED JUST BEFORE A VERY HIGH, NARROW, TWO-LANE BRIDGE IN SOLOMONS MARYLAND.  I LIMPED BACK TO THE AUTO SHOP AND MY MECHANIC READ THE CODE AND IT SAID \"CRANKSHAFT SENSOR\" AGAIN. I CALLED NISSAN WHO INFORMED ME I HAD 3 RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SHEEHY NISSAN IN WALDORF MD AT 0730.

THEY DENIED MY CLAIM BECAUSE MY CAR WAS AT 82,000 MI.  I WAS TOLD THAT IF IT HAPPENED BEFORE 80,000 MI., WHICH I FOUND OUT LATER WAS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL EMISSIONS WARRANTY ACT, THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY REPLACED THE ENGINE FOR FREE.

I WAS STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH A SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT, THE BATTERY LIGHT, OIL LIGHT AND BRAKE LIGHT ALL ON.  I TRIED TO RE-START MY CAR AND IT WOULD NOT START.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET IT INTO NEUTRAL.  AT FIRST THE ENGINE TURNED OVER LIKE IT WANTED TO START BUT IT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY START.  AFTER THE 3RD ATTEMPT IT STARTED UP.  I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO MY DESTINATION 5 MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED.  I AM VERY LUCKY AND WAS NOT REAR ENDED.     WHEN I PULLED INTO MY PARKING SPOT THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  THIS TIME IT TOOK ABOUT 5 ATTEMPTS TO GET IT TO RESTART.  THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO OUR LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND I WAS TOLD IT IS A CRANK/CAM POSITION SENSOR.  WE REPLACED THIS ITEM  AT A COST OF $185.21.  MY HUSBAND DID AN INTERNET SEARCH AND FOUND OUT NISSAN USA DID A RECALL ON 2002 AND EARLY 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA'S FOR THE CRANK/CAM POSITION SENSOR.  I CONTACTED NISSAN TO FIND OUT IF MY CAR WAS INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL AND WAS INFORMED I WAS NOT.  I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THIS PROBLEM IS A HAZARD TO MOTORISTS AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY NISSAN.  I WAS GIVEN A FILE #6422418 AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO FOR ME.  MEANWHILE I HAVE INVESTIGATED TO SEE IF OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND IT APPEARS TO BE WIDE SPREAD AMONG THE NISSAN ALTIMA'S AND SOME MAXIMAS.  IT IS ALSO NOT JUST AN ISSUE WITH THE 2002-2003 MODELS BUT EXTENDS UP TO THE 2005 MODELS. MOST OF THE CONSUMERS HAVE EITHER MADE A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN OR THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU-AUTOMOTIVE  LINE.  NISSAN DID MAKE A RECALL ON THE 2005 NISSAN ALTIMA FOR THE ECM WHICH JUST RESETS THE \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" BUT STILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE CRANK/CAM POSITION SENSOR.  SOME OF THESE CONSUMERS HAVE SPENT UP TO $500.00 TO GET THIS SENSOR FIXED.*TR",

IT CAME TO A HEAD THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS TAKING MY KIDS TO SCHOOL AND IT BOGGED DOWN ON ME WHILE PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC AND ABOUT GETTING ME AND MY KIDS KILLED.

AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, MY CAR IS NOT THE ONLY CAR WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS. SEVERAL COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED. APPARENTLY THE CRANK SENSOR IS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SENSOR ISN'T SENDING THE SIGNAL TO THE ECM. NISSAN HAS ONLY RECALLED THE ECM BECAUSE THE RECALLING OF THE SENSOR COSTS TOO MUCH TO RECALL. IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE TO DRIVE & THEN TO SUDDENLY HAVE THE CAR SHUT OFF.     I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN NISSAN. IT'S A WORLD-WIDE KNOWN BRAND YET THEIR CARS ARE FAILING AT ABOUT 50,000 MILES. IF AFTER THE ECM IS REPROGRAMMED, AND THE SENSORS ARE REPLACED, SOME CARS ARE STILL DYING & NISSAN RECOMMENDS NEW ENGINES. A CAR AT 60,000 DOES NOT NEED A NEW ENGINE.

ON 9/19, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER FOR SERVICE BECAUSE THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT WAS ON, THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING A LITTLE ROUGH AND HAD A SLIGHT RATTLE, AND MY OIL LIGHT STARTED BLINKING ON OCCASIONALLY. THE DEALER FLUSHED AND REPLACED THE OIL, AND ALSO REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND TWO OXYGEN SENSORS, AT A TOTAL COST OF $1700. THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME ON 9/23. I WAS AWAY 9/26-9/29 AND DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR. ON WEEKDAYS, I TYPICALLY DRIVE ABOUT 10 MILES TO AND FROM WORK EACH WAY. THE NEXT WEEKEND I DROVE THE CAR APPROX. 150 MILES, AT WHICH TIME I NOTICED THE RATTLE HAD NOT SUBSIDED AND THAT MY OIL LIGHT HAD STARTED TO BLINK ON AGAIN, ESPECIALLY AS I DROVE UPHILL. I ADDED 2 QUARTS TO THE ENGINE ON 10/4 AND TOOK THE CAR TO A JIFFY LUBE ON 10/8. THE JL TECH THAT REPLACED THE OIL TOLD ME THAT MY OIL WAS VERY LOW, SO I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE NISSAN DEALER ON 10/13. THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE RATTLE AS \"INTERNAL ENGINE FAILURE\" AND RECOMMENDED A NEW ENGINE FOR $5000. MY CONVERSATION WITH THE DEALER MECHANIC LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE CAR WAS BURNING OIL DUE TO A LEAKY CYLINDER, MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY FAILURE OF THE PRE-CATALYST. THE PRE-CATALYST OR 'PRE-CAT' FILTERS EXHAUST BEFORE IT GETS TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THE PRE-CAT IS CLOSER TO THE ENGINE THAN THE CAT CONVERTER, SO IT TENDS TO GET OVERHEATED. WHEN IT DOES, IT CAN BREAK DOWN, AND LITTLE PIECES OF IT CAN GET SUCKED BACK UP THE EXHAUST SYSTEM THE WRONG WAY, BACK INTO THE CYLINDERS, WHICH DAMAGES THE CYLINDERS & ALLOWS OIL TO LEAK INTO THE ENGINE. BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION, I WAS UNKNOWINGLY DRIVING WITHOUT ENOUGH OIL, AND PERMANENTLY DAMAGED THE ENGINE. I PARK MY CAR IN MY GARAGE & HAVE NEVER NOTICED AN OIL LEAK OR SMOKE FROM THE TAILPIPE. I HAVE NEVER GONE MORE THAN 5,500 MILES WITHOUT AN OIL CHANGE, AND I HAVE A RECEIPT FROM EVERY OIL CHANGE I'VE EVER HAD. THE CAR HAS NO OUTSTANDING SAFETY RECALLS. *TR",

I TOOK IT TO A RADIATOR SHOP AND THEY FIXED IT WHILE SAYING THAT NISSAN HAD USED CHEAP PARTS. A CAR THAT HAS LESS THAN 50,000 MILES ON IT SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON SO I TOOK IT TO AUTO ZONE TO GET THE  DIAGNOSIS OF THE PROBLEM. THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR WAS BAD AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. IT CAUSED THE CAR TO STALL WHEN CRANKING/STARTING AND LEFT ME STRANDED AT SOME POINTS AND TIMES BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START. AFTER REPLACING THIS SENSOR, LATER TO FIND OUT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE SENSOR AND WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL EVENTHOUGH I ASSUME THE SAME PARTS ARE USED ON ALL MODELS OF THE SAME KIND, ANOTHER SENSOR IS NOW CAUSING MY CAR TO IDLE HIGH WHEN IN PARK OR NEUTRAL. THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IN THE CAR CAUSES MORE GAS CONSUMING WHICH IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC BATTLE WITH FUEL PRICES, IS NOT FAVORABLE. NOW THAT I HAVE READ MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM ON 2002-2005 ALTIMA MODELS. IF THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED SOONER, THE CAR COULD HAVE STOPPED RUNNING IN TRAFFIC, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS RECALLED, AND CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT MAYBE EVEN DEATH. I BOUGHT THIS CAR IN CONFIDENCE THAT IT WOULD BE DEPENDABLE FOR MYSELF AND MY CHILD BUT SINCE I HAVE CALLED TO LOG A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN NORTH AMERICA THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAS THREE OTHER RECALLS THAT WERE STATED AS \" SERIOUS TO MY SAFETY\".  *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP NEVER RETURNED MY CALL/EMAIL AND NISSAN BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT SINCE MY VIN WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL, THAT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME A RECALL NOTICE FOR THIS PROBLEM.    I TOOK MY CAR INTO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT FIXED AND I WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE CRANK SHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR AND THEN FROM THERE, THEY WOULD REPROGRAM THE ECM.  AFTER BEING TOLD THEY NEEDED TO RUN A 100+ DIAGNOSTIC CHECK, I WAS INFORMED THAT IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE SENSOR, IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $200+, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE, SO WITH THE HELP OF A MECHANIC FRIEND, RESEARCHED THE CORRECT SENSOR, HAD HIM REPLACE IT AND THEN PROCEEDED TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO REPROGRAM.      AGAIN, WE WERE TOLD THEY NEEDED TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE, EVEN THOUGH I ALREADY TOLD THEM IT JUST NEEDED TO BE REPROGRAMMED.  I WAS INFORMED THAT IF THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED, THAT SERVICE WOULD BE ABSORBED INTO THE $100 DIAGNOSTIC FEE.  THEY CALLED ME BACK AND TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY CAM SHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR FOR THE ECM TO BE REPROGRAMMED AND THAT WOULD COST ME $300+.  I ASKED THEM WHY THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY WITH THE INFORMATION BEING RELAYED TO ME AND I WAS INFORMED THAT EACH DEALERSHIP OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY, SO THEY CAN'T BE LIABLE FOR ANOTHER DEALERSHIPS ASSESSMENT.    I JUST WANT MY CAR FIXED WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH I AM PURCHASING PARTS THAT AREN'T COMPLETELY NECESSARY TO FIX MY PROBLEM, THOUGH MY IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE THAT THEY SEND ME A RECALL NOTICE SO THAT I CAN GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY ANY MORE MONEY.  *TR",

TALKED TO REP ABOUT THE RECALL AND THE ISSUES WITH MY 2003 ALTMAN 2.5L AND WAS BASICALLY TOLD TO TAKE VEHICLE BACK TO DEALERSHIP TO HAVE ANOTHER SCAN DONE.  FEB 9, 2008 VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO LITHIA NISSAN TO RUN A SYSTEM SCAN.  AT THIS POINT THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING POORLY, HARD STARTS, STALLING, ROUGH IDLE.

WAS INFORMED THAT THE CATALYST IS BAD AND COULD NOT ONLY BE CAUSING THE MISS-FIRE CODE BUT MAY ALSO RUIN MY ENGINE.  ALSO THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR IS BAD.  APPROX COST OF REPAIR, $1000.   I CONTACTED MATTHEW AGAIN ABOUT THE RESULTS AND WAS TOLD THAT DUE TO NOT HAVING THE VEHICLE REGULARLY MAINTAINED AT A 'NISSAN' DEALERSHIP, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO TRACK A MAINTENANCE RECORD AND THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY CAR.  *TR",

IN FEB 2006 A SENSOR WAS REPLACED THAT HAD BEEN CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I PAID CLOSE TO $2,000 IN UNNECESSARY REPAIRS AND WAS CHARGED FOR A RENTAL CAR. I FOUND TODAY THAT NISSAN IS OFFICIALLY REPORTING MY 2006 ISSUE AS A RECALL. WHILE I'M VERY THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED OR HAD A CAR CRASH THAT RESULTED IN ANYONE ELSE BEING HURT BY THE UNIDENTIFIED RECALL AT THE TIME OF MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE FUNDS THAT I PAID AND I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU PLACE A PRICE TAG ON THE CAR STALLING SEVERAL TIMES AND 2 OF THOSE TIMES BEING ON 195.

NISSAN HAS ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS, AND IN SOME CASES REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE.  IT IS MY CONTENTION THAT NISSAN HAS MADE THE CONDITIONS OF THIS RECALL IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOST OWNERS TO MEET THEREFORE AVOIDING HAVING TO REPLACE A GREAT NUMBER OF ENGINES IN A VERY POPULAR CAR.   WHEN MY VEHICLE SUFFERED THIS DAMAGE IN OCTOBER OF 2007 I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER I HAD PURCHASED IT FROM. THEY INFORMED ME THAT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE RECALL IS THAT THE ECM (COMPUTER) IN THE VEHICLE REPORT A SPECIFIC TROUBLE CODE.  WITHOUT THAT CODE BEING PRESENT THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROCEED UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE RECALL.  IT IS MY CONTENTION THAT A VEHICLE SUFFERING FROM THIS DEFECT WILL NEVER REPORT THE TROUBLE CODE THAT NISSAN IS INSISTING IT HAVE.  THIS DEFECT CAUSES MATERIAL FROM THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TO BE SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE RESULTING IN MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE SEALS AND RINGS INSIDE THE ENGINE.  THIS DAMAGE WILL RESULT IN AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL TO EXIT THE ENGINE THROUGH THE EXHAUST SYSTEM CLOGGING THE OXYGEN SENSORS. WITHOUT FUNCTIONING OXYGEN SENSORS THE CARS ECM WILL NEVER REPORT THE MALFUNCTION OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHICH IS DETERMINED BY READINGS FROM THE OXYGEN SENSORS.  I ASSERT THAT NISSAN HAS DELIBERATELY PLACED THIS CONDITION ON THE RECALL TO AVOID PERFORMANCE UNDER IT.  THE ONLY CONDITION OF THE RECALL SHOULD BE A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TO DETERMINE IF THE PHYSICAL DEFECTS ARE PRESENT.  THIS IS COVERED IN STEP 'D' OF THE RECALL WHICH DEALERS NEVER GET TO BECAUSE THEY ARE STOPPED AT STEP 'A' WHEN THEY CANNOT GET THE ECM TO GENERATE THE TROUBLE CODE.

I TOLD HIM THAT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE, IT SHOULD BE FIXED THE FIRST TIME, AND HE SAID THEY COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY IT KEEPS HAPPENING.  I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AND THAT'S WHEN HE TOLD ME, NEVER MIND, THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ISSUE WITH THE CRANK POSITION SENSOR, WHICH WILL COST $330 TO REPLACE.

I RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND FOUND A RECALL ON THE NISSAN WEBSITE FOR THE CRANK ANGLE SENSOR ON ALL 2002 ALTIMAS, BUT NOTHING FOR 2003 ALTIMAS.  HOWEVER, WHILE RESEARCHING ON THE WEB I FOUND SEVERAL REPORTS, INCLUDING THE NHTSA WEBSITE (CAMPAIGN # 06V-242), INDICATING THAT A FEW 200,000 2003 ALTIMAS/SENTRAS (2.5 LITER) WERE BEING RECALLED FOR THE SAME CRANK ANGLE PROBLEM.  I BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP WITH THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT (CERRITOS) AND WAS THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SUPPORT AND SERVICE FROM THE TECHNICIANS.  FIRST, I WAS INFORMED THAT MY CAR WAS NOT UNDER THE RECALL. THEN, I WAS INFORMED THAT NOT ALL RECALLS ARE LISTED IN THE WEBSITE AND I WOULD HAVE TO GET MY CAR SERVICED FIRST AND ONLY AFTER COULD THEY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MY CAR IS UNDER THE WARRANTY. AND I WOULD NEED TO PAY FOR WHATEVER REPAIRS THAT WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE.  I DO NOT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS IF IT IS NOT A RECALL ISSUE; HOWEVER, SHOULDN'T THE NISSAN'S TECHNICIANS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS UNDER RECALL BY LOOKING INTO THE VIN NUMBER OR THE PARTS NUMBER? ALSO, THE RECALL IS NOT LISTED OR ANNOUNCED ON THE NISSAN WEBSITE BUT IS REPORTED IN SEVERAL ARTICLES. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NISSAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE, EVEN IF IT IS ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF VEHICLES.  AND THE DEALERSHIPS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK INTO THE PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES WITH THIS PARTICULAR CAR.

UPON HEARING THIS I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS (7/19) OF MY SITUATION AND WAS ADVISED TO CONTACT THE DEALER AND TELL THEM OF RECALL #06V242000.

SERVICE RECORDS DOCUMENT THAT THE PROBLEM THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT CRANK WAS REPORTED AS EARLY AS  23,619 MILES WHEN I HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED  IN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. SINCE IT WAS AN ONGOING PROBLEM, OTHER RECORDS SINCE THAT TIME REVEAL THE SAME COMPLAINT.  EACH TIME THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT THEY COULD NOT LOCATE THE REASON FOR THE PROBLEM. THE CAR WAS TAKEN IN RECENTLY BECAUSE IT BEGAN CUTTING OFF ABRUPTLY WHILE TRAVELING - AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  NOW THAT THE WARRANTY PERIOD IS OVER, WITH OVER 60,000 MILES, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE CRANK POSITION SENSORS AND THEY BOTH WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT DUE TO THE MILEAGE, IT WAS MY EXPENSE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED.  I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS ABOUT THE SITUATION REMINDING THEM THAT THE PROBLEM BEGAN BEFORE THE WARRANTY PERIOD WAS OVER AND THAT I HAD READ THEIR INFORMATION REPORTED TO NHTSA.

NISSAN NORTH AMERICA IS ALREADY AWARE OF THIS EXACT ISSUE IN THEIR 2004 AND 2005 NISSAN ALTIMAS WITH THE SAME ENGINE AS MINE, WHICH IS THE 2.5S ENGINE. THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF CONDUCTING A SERVICE RECALL RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE IN MY 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA.     3) NISSAN HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE. MY DEALER, WOODMEN NISSAN OF COLORADO SPRINGS HAS WORKED TO COMMUNICATE WITH NISSAN NORTH AMERICA TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND ADD THE 2003 MODEL TO THE RECALL. HOWEVER, NISSAN NORTH AMERICA HAS DECLINED BOTH MY AND THE DEALERSHIPS REQUEST TO ADDRESS THIS COSTLY AND SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS/FATAL FLAW IN THE AUTOMOBILE. *JB",

AFTER THE BREAKING PERIOD, MY FATHER STILL WAS GETTING ONLY 20 MPG SO RETURNED THE CAR ALONG WITH THE ORIGINAL WINDOW STICKER TO THE NISSAN DEALER IN HILLIARD, OH & THEY AGREED TO CHECK IT OUT WHICH THEY DID & REPORTED THAT THE CAR WAS FINE & OPERATING PROPERLY.

WHEN HE REALIZED HE WAS MISSING THE STICKER, HE RETURNED TO GET IT & WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T FIND IT.  HE TOOK HIS CAMERA TO THE DEALER & TOOK PICTURES OF LIKE STICKERS ON LIKE MODEL ALTIMAS CLEARLY SHOWING THE 23/29 MPG RATING.  A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER, HE TOOK IT IN AGAIN EXPLAINING IT WAS STILL NOT GETTING ANY BETTER MILEAGE & SOMETHING MUST BE DONE SO BONNIE, THE SERVICE MGR. THERE TOOK OVER.  AGAIN THEY CHECKED IT OUT & TOLD HIM THE SAME THING...THE CAR IS PERFORMING JUST FINE & THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHY HE IS NOT GETTING THE ADVERTISED MILEAGE.

I TAKE HIM BACK TO PICK IT UP & WE WAIT FOR BONNIE WHO TELLS US THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY METHOD THEY HAVE FOR TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY THE CAR IS ONLY GETTING 20MPG.  SHE AGREES TO CALL NISSAN HEADQUARTERS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR WOULD TRADE OUT CARS FOR MY DAD.  SEVERAL DAYS LATER SHE CALLS STATING SHE MADE THE CALL.  HE'S REALLY TRAPPED & AT HIS WITS END. I SUBSCRIBE TO CONSUMER REPORTS SO CHECKED TO SEE IF THEY HAD TESTED THE CAR & SURE ENOUGH THEY HAD.  THEY REPORTED GETTING ONLY 22MPG ON THE EXACT SAME 2003 4-CYLINDER MODEL, WHICH MADE ME START THINKING THAT PROBABLY NOBODY WAS GETTING THE ADVERTISED MILEAGE.

THE ONLY WAY TO DISENGAGE THE COMPRESSOR AFTER USING THE DEFROSTER IS TO STOP THE CAR, MOVE THE SELECTOR SWITCH TO ANY FUNCTION THAT IS NOT DEFROSTER RELATED, TURN OFF THE IGNITION AND RESTART THE CAR.

THIS WAS DISCOVERED BY MY WIFE AND I ON OUR WAY THROUGH CHICAGO ON I-94.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A SIMPLE WARRANTY PROBLEM THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET FIXED UPON MY RETURN TO WAUKESHA.  THE SERVICE BULLETIN MAKES IT SEEM THAT THIS IS NORMAL AND THE CONSUMER WILL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE PROBLEM.
