THEY CHARGED ME $350 FOR PARTS AND LABOR, AFTER I TOLD THEM THAT IF THE PROBLEM WASNT WARRENTY NOT TO DO ANYTHING SINCE I HAD NO MONEY AT THE TIME.  THEY TOLD ME THEY CHANGED THE 2ND GEAR BELT, A CLUTCH SENSOR, AND THE TRANSMISSION FILTER AND FLUID BECAUSE THE SEAL HOLDING IT TOGETHER WAS BAD.  2 WEEKS LATER I TAKE IT BACK.  THEY TELL ME THEY CANT FIND THE PROBLEM AND EVEN ACCUSE ME OF MAKING IT UP.  AFTER I LEFT THERE WITH MY CAR I TOOK IT TO A SHOP IN PARIS.  HE TOOK IT FOR A DRIVE CAME BACK AND CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION FILTER HIMSELF AND SHOWED ME THAT THE FILTER ON MY CAR WAS SO CLOGGED THAT NOTHING WAS GETTING THROUGH.  IT RAN FINE UNTIL ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD IT IN 2 MORE SHOPS.  A SENSOR IN MY TRANSMISSION IS GOING OUT AND THEY HAVE YET TO PINPOINT WHICH ONE IT IS.  COME TO FIND OUT AFTER LOOKING THROUGH THIS SITE AND A COUPLE OTHERS, MY TRANSMISSION WAS RECALLED AFTER I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SAME PROBLEMS IM HAVING IN IT NOW.  ITS SLIPPING OUT OF GEAR DURING ACCELERATION AND DOWNSHIFTING HARD AND STICKING WHEN COMING TO A STOP.  I NEVER RECEIVED NOTICE ABOUT THIS RECALL AND NO ONE HAS MENTIONED IT WHEN IVE BROUGHT IT IN.  I HAVE BEEN STRANDED FOR HOURS WHEN MY TRANSMISSION IS STUCK IN 1ST.  I HAVE HAD 5 VERY CLOSE CALLS WHEN IM DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND IT SLIPS OUT OF GEAR, 2 OF THEM BEING WHILE SEMIS ARE BEHIND ME.

THE DEALER STATED THE BATTERY WAS DEFECTIVE AND I DECLINED TO BUY THEIR BATTERY BUT BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY FOR THE CAR WHICH EXCEEDED THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE OEM BATTERY.  THE BATTERY WAS INSTALLED.  UPON TRAVELING BACK TO OREILLY'S AUTO PARTS TO RETURN THE OLD BATTERY FOR A CORE EXCHANGE, I HIT A MINOR BUMP IN THE PAVEMENT AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT HAS ILLUMINATED AGAIN.   THE PROBLEM OCCURRED WITH THE NEW BATTERY AND RECURRED FOR A SECOND TIME WHEN THE CAR HIT A MINOR BUMP.  I NOTE THAT OTHER 1999 HYUNDAI'S HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR A DEFECT IN THE WIRING HARNESS THAT CAUSES THIS LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF ALL ACCENTS HAVE THIS PROBLEM BUT THIS ONE DEFINETLY DOES AND IT CAN BE RECREATED.  DON CAVENAUGH MOTORS IS DISCOURAGING REPAIRS BY ALLEGING AN OLD BATTERY CAN CAUSE THE LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE WHICH IS FALSE, AND BY NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM.  NOW I MUST TAKE THE CAR BACK FOR A SECOND REPAIR MEANWHILE I AM HAVING TO DRIVE IT WITH THE AIR BAG LIGHT ON.  I BELIEVE THAT HYUNDAI AND THEIR DEALING ARE FALSIFYING SERVICE RECORDS SO THAT THEY DO NOT REFLECT A PROBLEM WITH THE AIR BAG LIGHT AS THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT.    MY REPAIR TICKET SAYS \"AIR BAG LIGHT\" AND STATES CUSTOMER DECLINED RECOMMENDED REPAIRS AND STATED HE WOULD GET A BATTERY FROM WAL-MART.  THIS REPAIR TICKET MISS STATES THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE PROBLEM WITH THE AIR BAG.  ALSO, WHEN HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CONTACTED THEY MADE A BLANKET DENIAL THAT THERE WERE OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  EVEN WITH GOOD QUALITY, IT WOULD BE NORMAL FOR A FEW CARS TO MALFUNCTION.
