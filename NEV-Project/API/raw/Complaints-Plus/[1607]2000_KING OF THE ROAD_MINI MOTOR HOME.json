THEY EITHER FAILED OR REFUSED TO DO ANY FURTHER WORK. I HAD PAID CASH FOR THE TRAILER AND DECIDED I WOULD GET REPAIRS DONE IN A LESS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. AT MY FIRST STOP I CONTACTED AN AUTHORIZED REPAIR CENTER ABOUT THE NON-FUNCTIONING PROPANE HEATER. THEY FOUND THAT THE DUCTWORK HAD NOT BEEN CONNECTED AT THE FACTORY. THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS EXTREMELY LOUD. THE DEALER REFUSED TO R REPAIR IT; CLAIMED THEY WERE THAT NOISY. TOOK IT TO 3 OTHER DEALERS. THEY ALL SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. 10 MONTHS LATER IT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BAD COMPRESSOR. THIS IS BEING REPLACED DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THE KITCHEN STOVE HAS HAD A YELLOW FLAME WHICH SMOKED UP PANS SINCE THE UNIT WAS PURCHASED. IT IS MFD. BY ATWOOD CORP. THERE IS NO PROVISION TO ADJUST THE AIR FUEL MIX ON THIS STOVE. THE COMPONENTS ARE: FIXED REGULATOR, FIXED GAS ORIFICES AND FIXED AIR SUPPLY. FOUR DIFFERENT DEALERS HAVE FAILED TO ADJUST THE UNIT, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT. THEY HAVE REPLACED PARTS WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. I JUST RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM NORCOLD ON THE GAS/AC REFRIGERATOR. THE TWO MOST PROMINENT RV DEALERS IN THE AREA REFUSED TO DO THE REQUIRED WORK, CITING SLOW PAYMENT & NIGGARDLY ALLOWANCE FOR LABOR BY NORCOLD. I AM PRESENTLY NEGOTIATING DIRECTLY WITH THE FACTORY TO REPAIR THIS UNIT MYSELF. THEY ARE RESISTING REPLACEMENT OF ANY COMPONENT THEY DON'T HAVE TO. I COULD GO ON FOR SEVERAL PAGES, BUT MY MAIN POINT IS THAT RV MANUFACTURERS ARE SHOVING OFF THEIR WARRANTY PROBLEMS ON DEALERS WHO DON'T HAVE PEOPLE QUALIFIED OR WILLING TO MAKE NECESSARY REPAIRS. THE OWNER IS LEFT TO JOUST WITH THE MANUFACTURERS, WHO DON'T REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION, R.D. BARBER",
