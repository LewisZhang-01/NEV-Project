THE CIRCUIT OVERHEATS, MELTS THE CONNECTORS AND THE BUS SHUTS DOWN AND WILL NOT START. TWICE THIS WEEK WE VE HAD BUSES SHUT DOWN IN INTERSECTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM ON ALMOST ALL OF THE 74 INTERNATIONAL BUSES WE HAVE. ALMOST ALL THE PLASTIC WIRE CONNECTORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH BUTT CONNECTORS, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ELECTRICAL SHORT FINDS THE WEAK PINT OF THE SYSTEM. IT WILL BLOW THE FUSE , OR MELT THE RELAY CONNECTOR. THIS PROBLEM CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME OF OPERATION. I BELIEVE THE ECM WIRING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE LOAD.MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE CARRYING KIDS. IF THE ENGINE SHUTS DOWN IN A INTERSECTION MAY CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT. WE HAVE ALREADY HAVE ROAD CALLS TO RESCUE BUSES ON FIELD TRIPS AND SPORTS TRIPS.",
