Toyota has since declined to help. They said they notified us via mail of a customer service campaign addressing the premature rust issue, but we never learned of the program and lawsuit until after the frame broke and I almost crashed. Later I saw the broken arm/frame under the vehicle. This frame failure can potentially be a catastrophic and deadly event.    I opened an insurance claim and it was denied and I was referred back to Toyota.   Our vehicle has been factory maintained it\u2019s entire life. No service advisors ever mentioned a possible problem to my family and I. I recently spoke to the Toyota service manager at Parker Toyota in Couer d Alene Idaho and his master technicians have seen the same failure that occurred on our vehicle.

IN MID-OCTOBER 2018 WE RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM TOYOTA MOTORS, INC., OF THE FOLLOWING: 'WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT NOTIFICATION ' ZH8 AND LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN ' HOF.'  THE ZH8 AND HOF WERE INSTITUTED AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINATION THAT THE FRAMES ON CERTAIN TOYOTA VEHICLES ARE PRONE TO 'EXCESSIVE, PREMATURE RUST CORROSION BECAUSE THE FRAMES WERE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED AND TREATED AGAINST RUST CORROSION WHEN THEY WERE MANUFACTURED.'  EXCESSIVE RUST CORROSION ON MY SUV 'COMPROMISES THE VEHICLES' SAFETY, STABILITY, AND CRASH-WORTHINESS BECAUSE IMPORTANT SUSPENSION COMPONENTS, ENGINE MOUNTS, TRANSMISSION MOUNTS, AND BODY MOUNTS ANCHOR TO THE VEHICLES' FRAMES'.  BY DRIVING MY HIGH END SUV, I WILL BE PUTTING MY FAMILY'S SAFETY AT RISK. ON 10/25/2018:  WE TOOK OUR SUV TO JIM COLEMAN TOYOTA IN BETHESDA, MD FOR FRAME INSPECTION. THE ATTACHED WORK ORDER SHOWS: 'INSPECTED AND FOUND NO PERFORATION. ELIGIBLE FOR CRC SPRAY ' CUSTOMER WILL RETURN AT A LATER DATE FOR FRAME CRC APPLICATION.'  IT WAS DURING THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THAT JIM COLEMAN ONLY HAD ONE PERSON PERFORMING THIS WORK. AND THAT WE HAD TWO YEARS FROM OCTOBER 2018 TO HAVE THE WORK PERFORMED BY TOYOTA AT NO CHARGE.    ON MONDAY MARCH 10, 2019, WE LEFT OUR SUV WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER SO THAT THE HOF WORK COULD BE PERFORMED.  WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALER AT 5:05PM ON FRIDAY 03/15/2019 INFORMING US THAT (A) OUR SUV HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED SINCE THE FRAME NEEDED TO BE REPLACED (B) THAT THERE ARE LARGE HOLES IN THE FRAME AND (C) NO WORK WOULD BE PERFORMED SINCE THE HOF HAD ENDED IN JANUARY 2019.   WE PAID OVER $60,000.00 FOR OUR TOYOTA SUV NOT MANY YEARS AGO.  WE LITERALLY RECEIVED A DIFFERENT ANSWER REGARDING THE CRC AND HOF EACH TIME WE CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER RELATIONS",

AFTER PURCHASING THIS SEQUOIA, I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT WHILE STOPPED IN TRAFFIC, AT TRAFFIC SIGNALS, AND BEHIND OTHER VEHICLES, THE CAR WOULD SUDDENLY ACCELERATE AND LUNGE FORWARD MOVING THE CAR SEVERAL FEET FORWARD.  THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES THIS OCCURRED, I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN REAR-ENDED.  I CAME TO REALIZE THAT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH A MOMENTARY SURGE IN THE ACCELERATOR.  EVEN WITH YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE, IT STILL CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO LUNGE FORWARD.   MY WIFE AND I HAVE NEARLY STRUCK VEHICLES IN FRONT OF US.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DURING WARRANTY AND REPORTED THE INCIDENTS.  OF COURSE WE RECEIVED THEIR STANDARD REPLY \"WE COULD NOT GET YOUR VEHICLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.\"   WHEN QUESTIONED FURTHER, WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS PROBABLY WHEN THE A/C PUMP WAS COMING ON, AND IT ONLY FELT LIKE WE WERE MOVING BUT ACTUALLY WEREN'T, AND THAT THIS WAS NORMAL.   WOULD MAKE SENSE, BUT THE VEHICLE DOES THIS WITH BOTH THE A/C ON AND THE A/C OFF THOUGH I MUST ADMIT IT SEEMS TO DO IT MORE FREQUENTLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. PLUS, THIS NEVER HAPPENED WITH MY PREVIOUS SEQUOIA. ALSO, IT IS NOT OUR IMAGINATION THAT THE VEHICLE IS MOVING FORWARD.  WE HAVE NEARLY STRUCK THE REAR END OF OTHER CARS AND MUST NOW STOP 8 - 10 FEET BEHIND OTHER VEHICLES.   I LOOKED ON LINE AND FOUND NUMEROUS OTHER SEQUOIA OWNERS REPORTING THE SAME PROBLEM, AND GETTING THE SAME RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA.  BEING SOMEWHAT MECHANICALLY INCLINED, I TOO BELIEVE THIS IS AN ELECTRONIC/COMPUTER CONTROL PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT AWARE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM CAUSING DEATHS, PLEASE DON'T FORGET US AS IT IS STILL AN ACCELERATION PROBLEM, AND FOR WHAT WE PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE, WE ARE OWED BETTER THAN THEIR LAME EXCUSE.
