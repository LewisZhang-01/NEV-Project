AFTER CONDUCTING RESEARCH MY STRONGEST BELIEF IS THAT SINCE THE RIM IS CAST AND NOT FORGED IT LACKS THE STRENGTH NEED FOR A PERFORMANCE VEHICLE AND THAT THE CRACKS ARE FATIGUE CRACKS WHICH OCCUR OVER TIME.  FURTHER, THERE IS NO SENSOR OR WARNING SYSTEM TO LET YOU KNOW THE CRACKS ARE PRESENT.  IN ADDITION, THE PROBLEM IS MAGNIFIED IN THAT THE CRACKS ARE ON THE INSIDE OF THE RIM AND NOT VISIBLE WHEN LOOKING AT THE WHEEL.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THERE WILL BE FATALITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS DEFECT.  I AM UPLOADING EVERYTHING I SENT TO MY INSURER WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY CANNOT COVER AFTER MARKET WHEELS, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE LESS EXPENSIVE.
