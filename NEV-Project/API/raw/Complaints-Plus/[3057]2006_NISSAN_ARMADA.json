I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. HOWEVER, UNFORTUNATELY,  THAT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED  IN THE LAST YEAR, AND I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I ALSO KNOW THAT IF I TURN OFF THE VEHICLE, AND RESTART IT THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIAGNOSE, \"CODE-WISE.\"  EACH TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED, I HAVE BEEN SLOWING DOWN EITHER, ON THE INTERSTATE, OR EXITING IT, GOING AT LEAST 60MPH. I HAVE 6 CHILDREN,  AND THIS IS OUR FAMILY VEHICLE.  THEY HAVE BEEN WITH ME 2 OUT OF THE 3 TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED. HAD I NEEDED TO MAKE AN ABRUPT STOP WHEN THIS HAPPENED, THE TURNOUT MIGHT HAVE YIELDED  IN INJURY, OR WORSE, FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE.  I HAVE NEW BRAKES AND ROTARS, MY BRAKE LINES HAVE NO LEAKS, AND IT HAS BEEN SERVICED AT A NISSAN DEALERSHIP WITH A FULL DIAGNOSTIC CHECK UP. THEY FIXED OLDER RECALLS AND CHANGED MY BELTS. THERE ARE CLEARLY ENOUGH PEOPLE WITH THE SAME EXACT YEAR MODEL, AT DIFFERENT MILAGES, IN AND OUT OF WARRANTY,  TO WARRANT THIS AS A DEFECT. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN WITH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS OF THIS VEHICLE, AS WELL AS OTHERS ON THE ROAD. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!",

THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS BEING REPORTED ON THE INTERNET ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE DESCRIBED THE SAME WAY.  IN FACT I RECEIVED A NOTICE ON A CLASS ACTION SUITE BEING FILED AGAINST NISSAN FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I WORK FOR NHTSA AND ATTEMPTED TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM WITH ODI TO NO AVAIL.  I WOULD EXPECT SOME SORT OF RESPONSE WHEN ME AND THE PUBLIC MAKE COMPLAINTS THAT CAN AND WILL BE LIFE THREATENING.  HOW MANY COMPLAINTS AND OR HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN CRASHES, INJURIES, AND/OR DEATHS BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE.  THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED IS ONE EVENT AMONG MANY.

THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHER SERVICE NISSANS OF REPROGRAMMING PCM $100, BRAKE ROTORS AND DISC REPLACEMENTS $1000+, COMPUTER RESETS $100-200, MASTER CYLINDER SENSORS REPLACEMENT $400.  MONEY MONEY MONEY ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE TAKING A STAB IN THE DARK OR JUST MAKING MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLUELESS AND BLIND AS THE CUSTOMER.  THE CURRENT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT POINTS AT A DELTA STOKE SENSOR FAULT THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT ALREADY AND I AM SURE YOU HAVE HAD 100'S OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS BRAKING PROBLEM.  HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DO YOU NEED TO PUSH A SAFETY RECALL WITH NISSAN REGARDING THEIR BRAKING PROBLEMS FROM EARLY VEHICLES?   THEY REPLACED THE 2008 ROTORS TO A THICKER MORE CAPABLE TYPE WHICH SHOWS THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INADEQUATE MATERIALS (TOO SMALL BRAKES FOR TOO MUCH POWER AND WEIGHT) USED IN THE EARLY MODELS    NOT SURE IF ANY DEATHS RECORDED BUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED WHEN SO MANY OF THESE EARLY NISSAN ARE HAVING BRAKE ISSUES.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS OF PEOPLE RUNNING INTERSECTIONS, SCHOOL CROSSINGS, RUNNING OFF AT CORNERS, HIGHWAY CRASHES ON THESE BLOGS AND I AM HOPING TO DOCUMENT THIS COMPLAINT SHOULD (TOUCH WOOD) ANYTHING HAPPEN TO ME, MY KIDS OR A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD THIS OCCUR AGAIN.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE SO AT LEAST I HAVE EVIDENCE OF THIS.    THANK YOU.  *TR",

I JUST FELT A HORRIBLE IMPACT, AND WE BOTH LANDED INTO THE STREET OF MY DESTINATION. THE CAR WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT. THERE ARE TWO DANGEROUS AND DEADLY BLIND SPOTS ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON EITHER SIDE. THE DIVIDERS OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND SIDE DOOR WINDOWS ARE EXTREMELY WIDE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS, THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE BLIND SPOT FURTHER BLOCKING THE DRIVER'S VISION. NOT ONLY DOES THE DRIVER NOT SEE OTHER VEHICLES, THE DRIVER ALSO DOES NOT SEE PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. I HAVE HAD A JOGGER IN MY BLIND SPOT, AND IT SCARED ME TO DEATH. OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE NISSAN ARMADAS HAVE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT ALMOST RUNNING OVER PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. I AM NOW PROCEEDING WITH TRADING IN THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS VEHICLE. I HOPE AND PRAY THAT AN INVESTIGATION WILL RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF CORRECTION TO THIS PROBLEM.   *TR",

EVERY YEAR I HAVE HAD TO GET BRAKES PUT ON THE ARMADA AND IT HAS TO BE NISSAN BRAKES BECAUSE I TRIED OTHER BRAKES AND THEY SQUEAL AND GRIND. NOW I HAVE AN RATHER SCARY SITUATION. I WAS DRIVING 25MPH AND PUT MY BRAKES ON AND MY SUV STARTED NOSE DIVING IN THE FRONT END AND THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON, NOT TO MENTION, THE BRAKES WOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY. IT WAS CATCHING AND RELEASING ABOUT 4 TIMES, EACH TIME I WOULD BRAKE. I ALMOST HIT A CAR. I DROVE IT TO A MECHANIC RIGHT THEN, AND THEY RAN  SCAN ON THE BRAKE CODE SINCE THE LIGHT CAME ON DURING THIS EVENT. THE CODE IS C1179. APPARENTLY THIS IS A DEALER ISSUE. I CALLED THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE ARMADA FROM AND THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR THE ABS SYSTEM. REALLY? THIS IS NOT A RECALL ISSUE? I HAVE READ SEVERAL REVIEWS AND THEY ARE ARE HAVING ABS ISSUES. COME ON NISSAN, HOW MANY LIVES HAVE TO BE LOST OR INJURED BEFORE YOU RECALL THIS ABS PROBLEM? WHY WOULD THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS $120 FOR A COMPUTER UPDATE TO THE SYSTEM IF IT IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT... THE OTHER ISSUES ARE: DRIVERS SIDE SEAT IS RIPPING, POOR MATERIAL, THE DRIVERS SIDE FLOOR MAT IS SLIDING UNDER THE DRIVER PEDAL, THE BLIND SPOT IS A SEVERE ISSUE ON THE LEFT DRIVERS SIDE, PAINT CHIPS EASILY, BAD GAS MILEAGE, RADIATOR LEAKS, STRUT IS BAD ON THE PASSENGER FRONT SIDE, WHICH IS CAUSING IT TO LEAK ON THE PAVEMENT WHEN PARKED.  *KB",

I WENT OUT TO THE VEHICLE, TURNED IT ON, THE BRAKE LIGHT WAS NOT ON. I DROVE THE VEHICLE AROUND FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES WITH NO PROBLEMS. I DID SLOW EVEN STOPS, HARD \"EMERGENCY TYPE\" STOPS, BRAKING AROUND CORNERS. NOT A SINGLE PROBLEM. I CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID, IT WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM LINE, SO I TOPPED IT OFF WITH THE PRESCRIBED BRAKE FLUID. THE CAR OPERATED JUST FINE UNTIL SEPT 12, 2008 AT APPROX. 4:50 PM WHEN AT 40 MPH I APPROACHED A TWO WAY STOP SIGN, APPLIED THE BRAKES, AND NOTHING HAPPENED, I FRANTICALLY PUMPED THE BRAKES, UNTIL THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME WAS CLOSE AND I INSTINCTIVELY PUT MY HANDS IN FRONT OF MY FACE. THE VEHICLE HIT THE CURB AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE, JUMPED THE CURB, CRASHED THROUGH A SAFETY SIGN, AND THEN CRASHED THROUGH A 18-24\" SEWER LINE THAT HAD YET TO BE BURIED. IN FACT THE ARMADA ALMOST ROLLED AS IT WAS RIDING ON TOP OF A PIECE OF THE SEVERED SEWER LINE. I CALLED 911, AND THEN SMELLED GASOLINE. HAZMAT WAS CALLED BECAUSE THE FUEL LINE WAS RUPTURED BY THE SIGN GOING UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY NOBODY WAS COMING THE OTHER WAY. I WAS TRANSPORTED VIA AMBULANCE, DIAGNOSED WITH A \"DEEP CHEST CONTUSION\" FROM THE SEAT BELTS. AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.
