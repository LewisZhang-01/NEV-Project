        "summary": "My 2005 Chrysler 300 has been having an issue with the fuel tank. When you get fuel in it then it won\u2019t stay started. It keeps stalling out repeatedly. It also stalls out randomly under 25mph. Both are dangerous as it may cause you to get T-boned leaving gas station as it repeatedly stalls. Also it stalled out on the freeway on-ramp under 25mph. This is also dangerous as you lose your steering at the same time. Someone could have been injured or killed. And Chrysler needs to take this more seriously than they did just with the 2005 300c. It\u2019s happening to more models of that year as well. Their offered remedy was telling me not to fuel it all the way up anymore past 3/4 of a tank. A dealership confirmed it needs a full fuel tank replacement and has had it since Memorial Day. They still have it currently. Chrysler told me and the dealership I\u2019m on my own after treating me horribly most of the time on the phone calls with customer care center as I was jumping through hoops for them over and over for around 2 months. Whenever I get someone kind and helpful they won\u2019t let me speak to them again. I have this all written down. And will get the estimate when I get my car back. But I don\u2019t have $2800 ($2000 alone is just the fuel tank) to fix this on my own. Especially not when there is a known issue. Fuel tanks just don\u2019t break and need full replacement as a common issue in vehicles. But Chrysler says my vehicle is too old. Which they knew the year of my vehicle when I called in the first place. And they know there is a known issue which is why they have lifetime fuel tank replacements on others of the same year. It\u2019s too bad they weren\u2019t pushed to do a total recall rather than just a safety bulletin. It left the rest of us that end up having issues with the fuel tanks in danger. It\u2019s not just coincidental. It\u2019s been acting up for awhile and I couldn\u2019t find anyone that had ever heard of this until the Chrysler forums. It got worse in 2020 to present.

THIS CAUSED TOO MUCH CURRENT TO FLOW TO 2 SMALLER 16 GAUGE GROUNDING WIRES ATTACHED TO THE REAR OF EACH HEMI CYLINDER HEAD TO FRY. THIS DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE CCN BUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE CPU. ANY DEVICE, MODULE, OR SENSOR ATTACHED TO THE CCN BUS CAN HAVE INTERMITTENT BEHAVIOR. EXAMPLES OF VERY BAD BEHAVIOR IN MY CAR: 1. THE ALARM RANDOMLY GOING OFF WHILE PARKED OR WHEN DRIVING THE CAR. 2. WHILE PARKED AND THE ALARM SET THE SUNROOF DECIDED TO OPEN UP DURING A RAINSTORM FILLING MY CAR WITH 3 INCHES OF RAIN. 3. THE 300C DOESN'T USE A THROTTLE CABLE. IT UTILIZES A THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR THAT COMMUNICATES WITH THE CPU OVER THE CCN BUS. JUST TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL WAS THE SAME AS PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO ME THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD AND I WAS CLOSE TO HOME.    SINCE THIS IS CCN 2-WIRE TWISTED PAIR BUS COMMUNICATION ISSUE ANYTHING THAT COMMUNICATES WITH THE CPU CAN HAVE A RANDOM INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. SINCE THESE CARS ARE GETTING OLDER I HAVE TO THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER CARS THAT ARE OR WILL HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES. PRAY TO GOD THAT YOUR THROTTLE DOESN'T STICK WIDE OPEN LIKE MINE DID. I HAD TO KEEP MY FOOT BURIED ON THE BRAKE WHILE I WAS SCREAMING DOWN THE ROAD UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION. HAVE FUN COMING TO A STOP OR DRIVING HOME AFTER THAT HAPPENS. FORMALLY I WAS AN I2C BUS COMMUNICATIONS(2 WIRE BUS) EXPERT AT BOTH INTEL CORP AND CISCO SYSTEMS. I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.     TODAY I TALKED WITH A BREMERTON CHRYSLER/DODGE/JEEP TECHNICAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BOTTOM-LINE OVER $3000 TO FIX.

I'VE TRIED PULLING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE (EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT APPLIED), I'VE TRIED TURNING THE CAR OFF AND RE-CRANKING IT, I'VE TRIED PUSHING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS HARD AS I COULD WHILE TRYING TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK, I'VE TRIED SHIFTING THE GEAR WHILE ON ACCESSORY, WITH IT RUNNING, WITH IT IN THE ON POSITION... NOTHING HAS WORKED.  I'VE EVEN TRIED TALKING TO IT NICELY!  THE SHIFTER JUST WON'T MOVE.  :(    AFTER READING ONLINE FORUMS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE PART THAT MESSES UP IS PLASTIC.

IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ROTATOR VALVE ATTACHED TO THE GAS TANK WAS STUCK/BROKEN AND REQUIRED A NEW GAS TANK, THE GAS WENT INTO THE CHARCOAL CANNISTER, ALSO NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND 2 NEW FUEL PUMPS AS WELL.  I RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND HAVE SEEN HUNDRED IF NOT MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENING TO OTHERS, THIS COST ME $2400.00 JUST FOR GETTING GAS.  I ALSO SAW ISSUES REPORTED FOR THE INNER TIE ROD  AND THAT WAS CONFIRMED BAD BY MY MECHANIC AS WELL AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CALL CHRYSLER SEVERAL TIMES LEAVING A MESSAGE AND TO DATE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CALL BACK.  I FEEL THIS WAS NOT SOME SMALL ROUTINE REPAIR BILL AND WITH THE AMOUNTS OF COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME ISSUE, CHRYSLER SHOULD OF MADE THE REPAIRS OR REIMBURSE THE DAMAGES,  NUMEROUS YEARS OF THIS MODEL AND SEVERAL OTHER CHRYSLER DODGE MAKES AND MODELS HAVE HAD THE SAME COMPLAINTS-MAYBE A RECALL SHOULD OF TAKEN PLACE.  I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS BEING LOOKED INTO IF THERE IS ANY OPTION FOR A REIMBURSEMENT IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER. HAD I CONTINUED TO DRIVE ON THE ROUTE 62 AT 45MPH  THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AS I STALLED DRIVING.  *TR",

THE PARTS WERE ORDERED AND THE INSTALLATION/REPLACEMENT WORK WAS DONE ON DECEMBER 6, 2013. THIS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THE CAR STILL STALLS, STARTING RIGHT AS I PULL OUT  FROM THE GAS STATION.

THIS MAKES STEERING VERY DIFFICULT AND IS VERY DANGEROUS, PARTICULARLY ON THE TWO-LANE ROADS I MOSTLY TRAVEL.

I SENSE THE ELECTRONICS IN THE ENGINE CALLING FOR GAS (OR NOT ACCEPTING GAS) WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING BAD IN THE GASOLINE LINE.  NOT SURE HOW THERE IS WATER IN THE TANK, AS THE CAR SINCE BEING PURCHASED NEW IS GARAGED WHEN AT HOME AND AT WORK AND WELL CARED FOR OTHERWISE.  I JUST READ THIS EVENING ON THE WEB THAT CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS KNOWN SINCE AT LEAST MAY OF 2013.

THE VALVE IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT LIQUID FUEL FROM ENTERING THE CHARCOAL CANISTER/EMISSIONS SYSTEM. WHEN THE VALVE FAILS, LIQUID GAS CAN ENTER THE LINE AND FILL THE CHARCOAL CANISTER.     AFTER REFUELING THE PCM ON THE VEHICLE DETECTS A CHANGE IN FUEL LEVEL. THEN, WHEN THE ENGINE MEETS CERTAIN TEMPERATURE AND DRIVING CRITERIA, THE PCM ISSUES A PURGE COMMAND TO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER TO REMOVE THE STORED GAS VAPORS. IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT ALL THE LIQUID GAS IN THE LINE GETS SUCKED INTO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. THE PCM EXPECTS TO SEE GAS VAPORS ENTERING THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND IT IS PREPARED TO ADJUST AIR/FUEL MIXTURES TO COMPENSATE. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PREPARED TO SEE LIQUID GAS COMING INTO THE INTAKE. THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL.    THIS CAN BE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH THE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD IN TRAFFIC.

SO FAR, EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND NORMAL. I THEN PRESSED THE BRAKES PEDAL, RELEASED THE HAND-BRAKE AND TRIED TO PULL THE GEAR SHIFTER FROM PARK TO REVERSE, NOTHING, IT DOESN'T WORK; IT'S STUCK. I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE, RESTARTED IT AND WENT TO THE SAME PROCESS TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE. STILL, NOTHING, EVEN AFTER ABOUT 20 REPEATS. FOR SOME REASON, THE GEAR SHIFTER WAS DEFINITELY STUCK IN PARK. EVEN OVERRIDING THE PARK INTERLOCK SYSTEM (AS RECOMMENDED BY CHRYSLER, IN CASE OF AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION) DIDN'T HELP. AFTER 2 HOURS TRYING, IN VAIN, TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE HELP OF A VERY KIND PASSERBY, ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED, I GAVE UP AND HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MY RESIDENCE.   AS I SEARCHED THE INTERNET THE NEXT DAY TO FIND OUT WHETHER ANY OTHER CHRYSLER OWNER HAD REPORTED SUCH AN EXPERIENCE, I FOUND HUNDREDS OF CHRYSLER AND DODGE OWNERS REPORTING SUCH AN EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR VEHICLE. THE CULPRIT IS A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC THAT CHRYSLER HAS USED AS A PART IN THE PARK INTERLOCK MECHANISM OF THEIR 2005 - 2007 CHRYSLER AND DODGE VEHICLES. A REPEALING SPRING IS ATTACHED TO THAT PART BY A TINY TAB. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF COMMONSENSE THAT AS THAT PART IS FREQUENTLY USED (DURING PARKING AND GETTING OUT OF PARKING), THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE TENSION OF THE SPRING AND THE WEATHER CHANGES WILL RESULT IN HAVING THE TINY TAB ON THE PINK PLASTIC PART EASILY BREAK. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO EVERY CHRYSLER AND DODGE MODEL THAT IS USING THAT PIECE OF PLASTIC.

WHILE TURNING LEFT THE CAR STALLED AGAIN AND I HAD A VERY HARD TIME RESTARTING. IN THE MEAN WHILE OTHER CARS WERE COMING AT ME FROM BOTH BEHIND ME AND IN FRONT OF ME. THIS REALLY SCARED ME SO I CALLED A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD BE AND WE SHOULD BRING IT IN. AT THAT POINT I DECIDED TO LOOK ON INTERNET TO CHECK FOR RECALLS AND ENDED UP FINDING THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR 2005 CHRYSLER 300C AS WE HAVE.

APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES LATER I GOT INTO THE CAR, STARTED IT, AND PLACED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO RELEASE MY GEAR FROM THE PARK POSITION. AS I DID THAT, THE GEAR WOULD NOT MOVE. I TRIED THIS APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 TIMES BEFORE GIVING UP. I THEN CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER DEALER IN NEW CARROLTON, MD AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE PART. I WAS INFORMED THAT I HAVE A RECALL ON MY VEHICLE IN REGARDS TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 05V460000 (POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION). AFTER BEING INFORMED OF THAT INFORMATION, I THEN PROCEEDED TO ASK THE REP. WILL THAT RECALL FIX MY GEAR FROM BEING STUCK IN THE PARK POSITION. I WAS PLACED ON HOLD AND WHEN THE REP. RETURNED, SHE INFORMED ME THAT THE MECHANIC SAID NO. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK PERFORMED AT A LATER TIME. I THEN CALLED AROUND TO DIFFERENT MECHANICS AND INQUIRED ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUE MIGHT BE. I RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM AT LEAST 3 OUT OF 5 MECHANICS WHO STATED THAT IT MAY BE THE BRAKE SENSOR FUSE BEING BLOWN OR IT MAY BE A SOLENOID THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. LATER ON THAT EVENING I WENT TO TRY AND MOVE THE GEAR AGAIN AND WAS UNABLE TO, SO I REMOVED THE CHROME PANEL THAT IS AROUND GEAR ASSEMBLY AND STUCK A FLAT HEAD SCREW DRIVER TOWARDS THE TOP AND PLAYED AROUND WITH IT. AS I WAS DOING SO, THE GEAR SHIFT MOVED FROM THE PARK POSITION. SO NOW I HAVE TO RIDE AROUND WITH A SCREW DRIVER IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE PARK POSITION. I FEEL THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE I HAVE 2 YOUNG CHILDREN AND WE COULD'VE BEEN STRANDED SOMEWHERE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 102,600.

I HAD READ ALL THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS HAD WITH WINDOWS (NOT WORKING) AND PULLING TO THE RIGHT AND HAD BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES BUT NOT THE ENGINE STALL ISSUE UNTIL OCTOBER.  I READ ABOUT NOT FILLING ONE OUNCE BEYOND WHEN THE PUMP SHUTS OFF BUT MY OBSERVATION IS EVEN THAT NOW IS TOO MUCH.  WHENEVER THE CAR IS FILLED UP, IT WILL STALL/SHUT DOWN 3-6 TIMES IN THE NEXT 2-3 MILES OF CITY DRIVING.  NO STUTTER, JUST SHUTS DOWN COMPLETELY.  I'VE TRIED SHIFTING TO NEUTRAL AND RACING THE ENGINE WHEN PULLING UP TO STOP SIGNS TO KEEP IT FROM STALLING, WITH LIMITED SUCCESS.  NOT THAT I AM RECOMMENDING THAT BUT BETTER THAN DYING WHEN YOU EXPECT IT TO ACCELERATE.  A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHEN GETTING ONTO THE ON-RAMP BUT MORE OF A STUTTER SITUATION THAN ACTUALLY STALLING.  FROM WHAT I'VE READ IT IS TOO MUCH GAS GETTING INTO THE ENGINE VIA EMISSIONS HOSE FROM TANK SO COMPUTER DOES NOT COMPENSATE WITH MORE AIR (ENGINE RACING WOULD BE THE RESULT) SO IT FLOODS OUT AS IN CHOKING OUT A LAWN MOWER FROM DECADES AGO TO GET IT TO STOP RUNNING.  I'VE OWNED 50 CARS AND THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS VEHICLE I'VE EVER OWNED BECAUSE OF THIS REASON.  EVEN KNOWING IT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN DOES NOT HELP SO I WON'T LET ANYONE ELSE DRIVE THE CAR.... IF THEY WERE TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN IN TRAFFIC AFTER FILLING THE TANK IT WOULD BE A FIREBALL WAITING TO HAPPEN.  IT'S A VERY NICE CAR TO DRIVE ONCE YOU GET THE STEERING (CRADLE SHIFT AND WEIRD CAMBER SETTINGS) ACCOMPLISHED BUT WE ARE LEAVING IT PRETTY MUCH ONLY FOR HIGHWAY DRIVING AND MANUALLY CALCULATING HOW MUCH GAS HAS BEEN USED AND SO AS TO LEAVE THE TANK 2-3 GALLONS SHORT OF FULL WHEN FILLING IT UP.  PAIN IN THE REAR TO BE SURE BUT BETTER THAN MAKING A LEFT TURN IN FRONT OF SOMEONE AND HAVING THE ENGINE DIE... ALONG WITH YOU.  *TR",

THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY CAR PULLED TO THE RIGHT WHEN BRAKING AND THEY TOLD ME TO GO TO GOOD YEAR AND I DID. THEY SAID IT WAS MANUFACTURING THAT THEY COULD NOT TIGHTEN UP THAT SIDE TAKE IT BACK BUT I ENDED UP PAYING FOR GOOD YEAR TO FIX THAT. NOW THE WARRANTY IS GONE FOR REAL  AND THE NOISE IS LOUDER.

MY WELL MAINTAINED 2005 CHRYSLER 300 ENGINE FAILED SUDDENLY AND DANGEROUSLY WHILE DRIVING.  AND THIS WAS 1 MONTH AFTER PAYING THE CHRYSLER DEALER $850 TO CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND COOLANT AT FACTORY SUGGESTED DATES.  WITH ONLY 56,000 MILES AND OIL CHANGED EVERY 5000 MILES (OWNERS MANUAL SUGGESTS 7500) THE CHRYSLER DEALER INITIALLY WANTED OVER $2000 TO FIX AN UNEXPLAINED INTERNAL WATER PUMP LEAK, AND TIMING CHAIN FAILURE.  ONLY AFTER HEATED DISCUSSION DID THEY BACK DOWN AND REPAIR IT FOR A $100 DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE 7/70 DRIVEDRAIN WARRANTY.   2. THE FAILURE, HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS, ITS CONSEQUENCES.  SIMPLY USING GOOGLE AND ENTERING \"CHRYSLER 2.7L ENGINE FAILURE\" LEADS TO HUNDREDS OF REPORTS OF SUSPECTED OIL SLUDGE (DUE TO POOR ENGINE DESIGN AND OIL NOT FLOWING PROPERLY) THAT CAUSES SUDDEN AND DANGEROUS UNEXPLAINED ENGINE FAILURE INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

IT HAS BEEN INTO THE SHOP FIVE SEPARATE TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM, AND HAS NOT AS YET BEEN REPAIRED. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN COMPLAINT I AM CONTACTING YOU REGARDING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS IN ITSELF EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS.    IN THIS INSTANCE, WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ELECTRICAL FAILURE, THE REPAIR TECHNICIAN WAS PULLING IT INTO THE SHOP TO LOOK AT IT, AND THE LEFT FRONT CONTROL ARM ON THE VEHICLE SNAPPED IN TWO. UPON OBSERVATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RIGHT FRONT CONTROL ARM WAS SEVERELY BENT AND READY TO SNAP.    THE REPLACEMENT CONTROL ARMS ARE TWICE THE THICKNESS, AND TWICE AS HEAVY, AS THE ORIGINAL. THIS IS PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT CHRYSLER NOT ONLY KNEW THAT THE ORIGINAL CONTROL ARMS WERE DEFECTIVE AND/OR INEFFECTIVE, BUT THAT CHRYSLER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE ISSUANCE OF A RECALL FOR THE SAID DEFECTIVE/INEFFECTIVE PART.     BREAKING CONTROL ARMS ON THE VEHICLE CONSTITUTE A KNOWN VEHICULAR HAZARD THAT CAN CAUSE INJURY, DEATH, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. I HEREBY REQUEST THAT THE NHTSA CONSIDER THIS A FORMAL COMPLAINT AND REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE SAFETY RECALL FOR THE 2005 CHRYSLER AND ANY OTHER OF THE CHRYSLER VEHICLE(S) WHICH MAY USE THE SAME CONTROL ARMS, PART NUMBER 4782561AE, IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY. THIS DEFECT ENDANGERS NOT ONLY THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS OF THE VEHICLE ITSELF, BUT ALSO OTHER DRIVERS WHO MAY BE IN THE WAY WHEN THE CONTROL ARMS SNAP.    WHEN I CONTACTED CHRYSLER ABOUT THE PROBLEM I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS JUST ?TOO BAD? AND THAT I COULD NOT PROVE I HAD NOT DONE SOMETHING WHICH CAUSED THE PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH I ADVISED THEM I KNEW THAT THEY HAD REPLACED THEIR INVENTORY WITH BIGGER, STRONGER CONTROL ARMS. UTILIZING THE ?REASONABLE PERSON? LEGAL TENANT, ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT CHRYSLER IS TRYING TO DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE VEHICLE.   *JB",
