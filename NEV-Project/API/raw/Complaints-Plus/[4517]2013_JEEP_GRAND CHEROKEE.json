I believe the fuel pump is part of the problem seeing how at a qt tank of gas it will die and only run when more gas is added but also the body control module cause it keeps throwing diff codes after I fix the issues.

Problems line up with exactly this existing recall  NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID: 17V435000 \"If the alternator fails, the vehicle may stall without warning, increasing the risk of a crash. There is also the possibility that the alternator may short circuit, increasing the risk of a fire.\"  Jeep/Chrysler already fixed this recall on this specific car in 2018. According to dealership the warranty for repair is 2 years. Jeep is allegedly \"fixing\" these cars resulting in the recall consequence to happen regardless. Looking into this issue online it seems I am not the only person to experience this. Jeep/Chrysler needs to open the recall back up as there are unsafe cars on the road unbeknownst to drivers.   In addition to this there is an existing recall-NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID: 19V813000- fuel pump relay, which can result in the car suddenly stalling and causing an accident. I have been trying for two years to get this repaired by various Jeep dealerships. They claim there is a limited amount of parts. I have been informed numerous times that if the car stalls as a result of that recall they will reimburse the repair, which indicates there isn't a shortage on the part. Jeep is dragging their feet leaving unsafe cars on the road.",

IT FAILED & WOULD NOT START DEC. 2019 SO I TOOK IT IN & GOT IT BACK A WEEK LATER. THEY CLAIMED MY BATTERY WAS DEAD & WOULD NOT HOLD CHARGE. HOWEVER, THE DAY BEFORE IT WOULDN'T START, I'D DRIVEN IT BACK FROM DALLAS TO LAFAYETTE, LA W NO STALL. I'D ALSO DRIVEN IT AROUND THE MORNING IT STOPPED WORKING SO I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT, BUT PAID FOR THE REPAIRS & A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, IT FAILED AGAIN.

LESS THAN 24 HRS LATER, IT STALLED AGAIN. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ALL LAST WEEK TO REPORT THE DAILY STALLS & WENT BACK IN THIS PAST MONDAY, THE 27TH, AFTER THEY DID NOT RETURN MY CALLS TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. IT STALLED THERE IN THE DEALERSHIP PARKING LOT, & THEY GOT A TECH TO RUN THE CODES & IT CAME BACK AS THE RECALL PART. THEN THEY RAN SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTICS PER FCA'S REQUEST & SAID THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE IT. SINCE MONDAY, IT HAS STALLED TWICE SO FAR TODAY, ON WEDNESDAY.

THIS RESULTS IN AND UNEXPECTED AND SUNDOWN JOLT/JERK. EVEN MORE SO, I'VE BEEN SEEING MORE SERIOUS AND RELATED ISSUES WHERE IT RUNS AT 3,500/4,000 RPMS WHILE NOT ACCELERATING. SEEMS SLOW AND SLUGGISH.

        "summary": "ON JAN 7, 2015, WHILE I WAS DRIVING TOWARDS THE GARAGE, MY VEHICLE (GRAND CHEROKEE 2013) SUDDENLY (UNEXPECTEDLY) ACCELERATED AND, ALTHOUGH I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL, IT CRASHED AGAINST THE WALL.  THE VEHICLE ACTIVATED AIRBAGS BURNING AND BRUISING MY BODY; I WENT TO THE ER AND RECEIVED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.  SOME OF THE PARTS REPLACED FOR THIS CRASH INCLUDED, BUMPER AND HOOD ASSEMBLIES, A/C DUCTS AND EVAPORATOR, GRILLE, RADIATOR, HEADLIGHT, COMPUTER, WIPER WASH CANISTER, WATER PUMP, FAN, SEAT BELT AND ONE FENDER, ETC.  IN ADDITION THE CRASH TOLL CAUSED STRUCTURAL DAMAGES TO THE PROPERTY.  THE SERVICE SHOP COMPLETED THE REPAIRS ON FEB 27, 2015.    ON MARCH 2 AND MAY 20, 2015 I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER BECAUSE OF TRANSMISSION SHIFTING FAILURES.  THEY FINALLY CHANGED THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION BY MAY 29, 2015.  ON JULY 2 I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTER BECAUSE THERE WAS A NOISY RIDING AND CHECK ENGINE WAS ON; BY JULY 16 THEY HAD REPLACED ONE SHOCK ABSORBER, THE GAS PUMP AND TANK, AND ONE OXYGEN SENSOR (MILEAGE AT THIS POINT 22,594).  ON JULY 22, 2015 I WENT BACK AGAIN BECAUSE OF CHECK ENGINE AND THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR REPLACING THE CATALYST.    BECAUSE OF THE UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION EVENT, ALL ABOVEMENTIONED REPAIRS, PLUS FIVE EXECUTED RECALLS (ONE STILL OPEN R909/NHTSA 14V-115) AND AN IMMINENT SIXTH RECALL FOR START BUTTON (THAT DOES NOT SHUTS OFF); I DON'T TRUST THIS VEHICLE'S SAFETY AND QUALITY.  I'M AFRAID OF HURTING ME OR SOMEONE ELSE; I COULD NOT AFFORD REPAIRS AT UPCOMING WARRANTY EXPIRY.  THEREFORE, I HOPE YOU BUY BACK THIS DEFECTIVE GRAND CHEROKEE 2013.",

THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER A DOZEN TIMES SINCE I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BRAND NEW AND THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM SAYS THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. IT IS GOING BACK TO THE DEALER MONDAY 2/23/2015 AGAIN FOR THIS PROBLEM AND TO REPLACE A SHOCK. THE LAST TIME THEY SAID ALL THEY COULD FIND WAS THAT THE TRANY FLUID WAS LOW NOT SURE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH MY PROBLEM. ANYWAY I REALLY LOVE MY JEEP HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY DANGERS PROBLEM. I WORK AT CHRYSLER SECOND SHIFT AND WHEN DAY SHIFT LETS OUT THERE ARE OVER 100 WORKERS LEAVING AND IF MY FOOT WAS NOT PRESSED FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE I COULD HAVE HIT ONE OF THEM. I HAVE THE 5.7 HEMMI ENGINE AND PERSONALLY I THINK IT IS A COMPUTER ISSUE HOWEVER I AM NOT A MECHANIC SO LIKE I SAY THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL THINKING. THE VEHICLE MILEAGE I GAVE YOU IS A CLOSE GUESS I AM NOT ABLE TO GET THE EXACT MILEAGE AT THE TIME I AM SENDING THIS TO YOU. SHOULD BE GIVE OR TAKE AROUND 100 MILES. I CAN GO A MONTH OR WHAT EVER WITH NO PROBLEM THEN BAM IT HAPPENS. MY PHONE NUMBER IS [XXX ]FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
