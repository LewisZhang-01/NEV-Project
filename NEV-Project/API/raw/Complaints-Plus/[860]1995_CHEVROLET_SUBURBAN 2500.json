FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL IT AND COAX IT BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY WITHOUT INCIDENT OR INJURY.  RESEARCH WITH MY LOCAL DIESEL EXPERT SHOWED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO A FAILING INJECTOR PUMP AND FURTHERMORE IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE PUMPS.  THE PROBLEM IS NOW EASILY REPRODUCED SIMPLY BY SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY AND RUNNING THE TRUCK.  IT WILL START, AND THEN REV TO 3000+ RPM ON IT'S OWN, THEN BACK TO NORMAL. IT WILL DO THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES WITHOUT WARNING.   NOT ONLY IS THIS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR ($2000 IN PARTS ALONE) BUT IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS.   HAD I BEEN AT A STOPLIGHT WITH A PEDESTRIAN OR ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME AND IT SURGED I COULD HAVE EASILY KILLED SOMEONE.  CONSIDERING THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS KNOWN BY MY MECHANIC, THE POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUES AND THERE IS A TSB ON THIS FUEL PUMP (01349A)  I AM STUNNED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A MANDATORY RECALL.  *TR",
