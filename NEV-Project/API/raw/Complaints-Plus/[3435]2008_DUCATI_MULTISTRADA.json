SO FAR MY TANK HAS ONLY CRACKS IN THE PAINT, AS WELL AS FITMENT ISSUES ON THE MOTORCYCLE'S FRAME, BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT AN EVENTUAL FAILURE OF THE TANK FROM CONTINUED DEFORMATION, CAUSING FUEL LEAKAGE.  OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS OCCURRENCE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A POSSIBLE FIRE AND/OR CRASH.  THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM ON LATE MODEL DUCATI MOTORCYCLES, AND APPEARS TO BE CAUSED BY THE ETHANOL ADDED TO GASOLINE IN THE US. *TR",
