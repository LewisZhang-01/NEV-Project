THIS DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT OCCUR BUT SOMETHING WAS BAD WRONG INSIDE THE ALTERNATOR. IT WAS BOILING THE ACID OUT OF THE BATTERY TOO. ONCE THE ALTERNATOR WAS REMOVED (BENCH CHECKED FAILED) AND REPLACED IT ALL WENT AWAY. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WEATHER GETS BELOW 24 DEGREES AGAIN.

IN ATTEMPTING TO GET THE CAR JUMPED, IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT, THE ALARM WOULDN'T WORK, THEN THERE WAS A SLIGHT ELECTRONIC BUZZ AND FINALLY (AFTER ABOUT A 1/2 HOUR) THE BATTERY STARTED TRYING TO WORK. IT EVENTUALLY STARTED. I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR AND AM TRYING TO FIND A DEALERSHIP THAT'LL LOOK AT THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SAYING, \"IF IT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO BUT CHARGE YOU FOR A DIAGNOSTIC.\"     I'M WRITING BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD. I HAVE 3 YEAR OLDS THAT I TRANSPORT. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A REASON WE CAN'T SAFELY EXIT A PARKED CAR. I'M LITERALLY FRIGHTENED TO DRIVE THIS CAR AND IT'S MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS LOCK ISSUE WILL AFFECT MY JOB AND MY POCKETS. I SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES POSTED FOR THE 2006 SATURN VUE RELATED TO THE LOCKING MECHANISM. THIS NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AND REPAIRED NOT AT THE CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE. I TRUSTED SATURN TO PROVIDE ME WITH A SAFE PRODUCT. I PAID EVERY CENT OF WHAT WAS ASKED FOR THE TRUCK. I DID MY PART AND I HOPE YOU DO YOURS BY MAKING MY TRUCK SAFE AGAIN.",

AS A RESULT, I STARTED JIGGLING THE SATURN KEY TO SEE IF THERE WAS IMPROPER/ INADEQUATE CIRCUIT CLOSURE. WHEN I JIGGLED THE KEY, IT WAS LOOSE AND CAME OUT, BUT THE CAR REMAINED RUNNING!  SINCE THEN I HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIMILAR INCIDENTS AND THE RADIO DISPLAY STILL DOES NOT DISPLAY FULLY ACROSS THE SCREEN AND THE SEAT BELT CHIME STILL DOESN'T WORK.    (APPROXIMATELY MAY 2013) I STARTED HAVING DIFFICULTIES GETTING KEY TO TURN IN IGNITION ENABLING THE VEHICLE TO START. I WENT TO GM DEALER TO GET A NEW KEY IN CASE THAT MIGHT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM - IT DID NOT. RECENTLY (AUGUST 2014) ASKED A NON-GM MECHANIC ABOUT KEY TURNING DIFFICULTIES. HE INDICATED 'TUMBLERS' GETS 'STICKY' & PREVENTS KEY FROM TURNING & THAT IT WOULD GET WORSE UNTIL I REPLACED IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER. I CHECKED ON-LINE FOR RECALLS, AS SO MANY GM VEHICLES WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR IGNITIONS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT. THE 2006 SATURN VUE WASN'T ON THE LIST. I WENT TO LOCAL GM DEALER (BUICK/ GMC DEALER IN NAPERVILLE, IL) IN SEPTEMBER 2014 & THEY CONFIRMED THE 2006 VUE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER A RECALL. I WENT AHEAD AND PROVIDED MY VIN #, PROOF OF OWNERSHIP (TITLE AND DRIVERS LICENSE) AND THEY QUOTED A PRICE OF $90 FOR THE IGNITION CYLINDER, $60. TO OBTAIN AND USE THE GM CODE TO PROGRAM THE NEW IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER, & THIS DID NOT INCLUDE A NEW KEY! THEY DID THEY WORK & EVEN INCLUDED A KEY @ NO ADDITIONAL COST. NOW I AM ATTEMPTING REPLACEMENT OF IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER, BUT IT REQUIRES KEY TO BE TURNED TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION TO REMOVE THE CYLINDER. I CAN'T GET KEY TO TURN, SO CAN'T REPLACE CYLINDER AND THE CAR IS NOT OPERABLE.    I BELIEVE 2006 SATURN VUE SHOULD BE RECALLED TOO.  *TR",

THE RECALL WAS EVEN MORE SPECIFIC FOR CARS IN \"WARM WEATHER STATES\" INCLUDING NEVADA.  I AM THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER OF THE VEHICLE AND IT HAS BEEN REGISTERED AND USED IN NEVADA ALL IT'S LIFE.  I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT GM ABOUT MY CONCERNS AT THE LACK OF RECALL ON THIS PART, AND BEEN MET WITH ONLY SILENCE.    I FIND IT VERY, VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A PART THAT IS THE SAME, CRACKED THE SAME WAY, IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY SORT OF RECALL FROM GM THAT PUT MY FAMILY AND I AT GRAVE RISK.  WE JUST HAD TO SPEND OVER $1000 TO GET THIS ITEM REPAIRED, AND HAVE KEPT THE OLD PART FOR REFERENCE.  I WOULD ENCOURAGE A SEARCH OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL PUMP IN SATURN VUE CARS OR OTHER GM PRODUCTS IN WARM WEATHER STATES TO SEE IF GM CAN BE MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO DO THE CORRECT THING AND ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL ON THIS PART THAT COULD LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC FIRE.

THIS PAST WEEKEND MY SON BORROWED THE CAR AND HAD LOTS OF TROUBLE TURNING THE KEY, SO TOOK THE CAR IN TO SATURN AGAIN AND HE SAID THE KEY WAS WORN AND AFTER WE KIND OF ARGUED ABOUT IT, HE ADMITTED IT WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM OF SATURN.  WENT IN ON INTERNET AND FOUND IT IS MORE THAN COMMON.  DON'T KNOW WHAT DEALER WILL DO FOR ME, I JUST HAVE 3000 MILES LEFT ON WARRANTY, BUT I LEFT CAR THERE, BECAUSE LAST WEEK I ALSO TOOK IT IN FOR A GRINDING METAL SOUND AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE TIMING BELT, WHICH THEY CHANGED, BUT WITHIN TWO DAYS THE SOUND WAS BACK, SO I LEFT IT THERE HOPING AGAINST ALL ODDS THAT THEY WILL TRULY FIX IT.    THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A RECALL FOR THE IGNITION KEY PROBLEM, SINCE IN 1 1/2 YEARS TIME THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT RIGHT.

        "summary": "2006 SATURN VUE WITH 18,000 MILES. THREE TIMES, WHILE MY 73 YEAR OLD MOTHER WAS DRIVING, THE ENTIRE WARNING LIGHT CLUSTER HAS COME ON WHILE DRIVING. THE FIRST OCCURRENCE SHE PULLED OVER AND STOPPED THE MOTOR. SHE RESTARTED IT AND THE LIGHTS REMAINED ON FOR ABOUT 1 MILE, THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO BE WORKING OKAY, THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT BEFORE SHE GOT HOME. SHE REPORTED IT TO THE DEALER (IT IS A LEASE VEHICLE). THEY ASKED HER TO DRIVE IT IN THE FOLLOWING DAY; THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND RETURNED THE CAR TO HER. THE SAME THING HAPPENED ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER. THIS TIME THE LIGHTS REMAINED ON AND THE DEALER SAID IT WAS TRACED TO A BAD ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. THEY REPLACED THE CONNECTOR AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO MOM. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER THE LIGHTS ALL CAME AND THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM FAILED. MOM COULD BARELY TURN THE WHEEL ENOUGH TO PULL OVER. FORTUNATELY SHE WAS STOPPED AT THE TIME TALKING TO A FRIEND ON THE STREET NEAR HER HOUSE. IF SHE HAD BEEN IN TRAFFIC THERE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT. THE DEALER SENT A TOW TRUCK RIGHT AWAY AND PICKED UP THE VEHICLE. THEY HAVE REPLACED AN ELECTRONIC MODULE AND THE LIGHTS STAYED ON; THEY NOW HAVE CHANGED THE MAIN COMPUTER AND A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BANK OF LIGHTS CAME ON. NOW THEY ARE WORKING ON GETTING HER A DIFFERENT VEHICLE, ONE THAT SHE CAN FEEL SAFE IN. EVEN IF THEY REPLACE EVERYTHING IN THAT VUE AND GET THE LIGHTS TO STAY OFF SHE DOES NOT FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT DRIVING IT -- IF THE STEERING FAILS IN TRAFFIC THERE WILL BE A WRECK AND POSSIBLE INJURY/DEATH. THE DEALERSHIP IN COLORADO SPRINGS WHERE SHE LEASED IT FROM IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT -- THEIR SERVICE HAS BEEN GREAT, JUST A PIECE OF JUNK SYSTEM IN THE 2006 VUE. *TR",
