The arrow indicating the cars position on the map was totally wrong and the arrow did not follow the actual road.  The NAV indicated the car was going off road and even into bodies of water.  This was a dangerous issue because it required the driver to take their eyes off the road to ascertain what the issue was and cancel and restart NAV guidance.  Cancelling and restarting NAV did not help.  Once at the desired location the NAV was reset to come HOME and that failed totally.  The car is parked 40 minutes from the previous destination, but the NAV is still showing the vehicle at the previous destination.  A dealer recommended reset at home was done with no favorable results. The car has not been taken in for repairs while the internet is being searched for others that have had the same issue.  Apparently this is a common problem and potential safety issue for the driver and occupants. This issue happened without warning and there was no warning.",

I automatically got worried,  but as i climbed a mountain in Western North Carolina the message also said ABS SYSTEM,  Power steering system and turned off power steering automatically making new use force to turn the vehicle on a curvy road up to clingmans dome. The power steering got me shook as i have enough skill to not cause an accident,  but after getting down the mountain to Sevierville,  tn it got worse.  All the lights starting random flashes,  and then nothing.  No issue,  no warning lights,  nothing.  The emergency brake light came on and went off in no specific rhythm, again the abs system,  and mainly the stability system started coming on,  and power steering went off again with no reason.  I then drove to my jobsite with 0 other incidents for the next 20 minutes. I do not know the issue but it started with the stability system flashing.  The electrical seems to not be functioning correctly placing my safety at risk.",
