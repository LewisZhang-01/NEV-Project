SOMETHING LIKE 30PAIRS OF WIRES ARE THERE. COVERED IN A CABLE JACKET. SMOKE WAS EVIDENT BUT NO FIRE. I REPAIRED THE PROBLEM AND IT OCCURRED AGAIN. AS NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE IT OUT TODAY IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY CAUSING HIGH AMPS AND HEAT, YET NO FUSES WERE BLOWN.        A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER I CAME ACROSS A MINI VAN SIMILAR IN AGE AND STYLE OF MINE. ON FIRE, BURNING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD OF AN INTERSTATE. AT THAT POINT I KNEW I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING WITH MY VAN. I CAN NOT MORALLY SELL THIS DEATH TRAP.       IF THE NHTSB WOULD LIKE IT THEY CAN CONTACT ME TO GET IT. I CAN NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THING TO CATCH FIRE AND KILL SOME ONE. THESE MUST BE DESTROYED.  *TR",
