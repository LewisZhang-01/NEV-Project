Shortly after I purchased truck in 4-2017  the steering rack rusted off, had that repaired, few months later noticed rear differential was dripping due to rust eating through entire casing. My mechanic informed me that there was a recall issue involving frame rust so I took it to Toyota service dept. where they inspected and said it was fine and that the recall had expired. I went ahead and spent $1100.00 for new tires and a few weeks later heard noise underneath, turns out exhaust reducer is rusted apart, but when I looked at frame I was shocked to see several holes, a couple the size of my fist and frame looks like it is starting to twist. I took it to dealer again to have them look at it and they just said there is nothing they can do for me at this point. The rest of truck is rust free, in great shape, it was 80% garage kept. Please let me know if there is any recourse for me with this potentially dangerous situation.",

Now in 2021 the frame is starting to show signs of rust along the main frame beside the fuel tank when I had the vehicle in for inspection. I was a little confused sense it was undercoated but then reading more about the undercoating it may have made it worse by holding the moisture in and making it rust. I contacted Toyota to see if they would replace and or help me with the cost in replacing the frame since the truck is in excellent shape with 114k. And there response was NO the recall has expired and we can not do nothing. I priced a frame replacement and its over 11k. Also, reading a lot of other Toyota Tundra complaints about the undercoating and not installing a new frame around the same time period and everyone feeling the coating was going to last as long as the truck.

CONTACTED CORPORATE TOYOTA IMMEDIATELY. CASE WAS PUSHED TO A SENIOR MANAGER AND FINALLY RECEIVED A RETURN CALL 13 DAYS LATER.

TOYOTA IS A COMPANY I THOUGHT WAS BASED ON 'PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, AND SAFETY', BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT. I RECEIVED THE CAMPAIGN TO BATTLE THE RUSTY FRAMES BACK IN 2014 AND WAS PROACTIVE AND COMPLETED THAT AT THE DEALER. THE DEALER PERFORMED THE UNDERCOATING WHICH DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT COVER THE RUST AND INCREASE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FRAME. SINCE THEN, I HAD DRIVEN MY TRUCK TO AND FROM WORK AND RELIED ON IT TO SAFELY TRANSPORT MY FAMILY EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT ANY LONGER. I FIND THIS TO BE COMICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR TOYOTA TO TURN A BLIND EYE. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER 2006 TUNDRAS THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES, HOWEVER THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ONLY LISTS 2007-2008 TUNDRAS THAT COULD WARRANT FRAME REPLACEMENT.

CORPORATE TOYOTA WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THAT.  I'M AT A LOSS AND DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TOYOTA EXPECTS ANYONE TO JUST WALK AWAY AND DO NOTHING.  CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WILL OCCUR AGAIN FOR THE 2006 TUNDRAS.

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE RUST PROTECTION POLICY WARRANTY, THE ORIGINAL OWNER REQUESTED FRAME RUST EVALUATION AND REMEDIATION. TOYOTA PERFORMED THIS SERVICE IN 2015. THIS TRUCK HAS LESS THAN 70,000 MILES.  FOLLOWING MY PURCHASE, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO TOYOTA AUTONATION IN LIBERTYVILLE IL FOR A MECHANICAL INSPECTION. AT THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THE FRAME WAS PERFORATED. THE TOYOTA AUTONATION SERVICE MANAGER SUBMITTED A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PERFORATION TO TOYOTA CORPORATE TO REQUEST FRAME REPLACEMENT. HE WAS TOLD BECAUSE RUST REMEDIATION SERVICE HAD BEEN PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY, TOYOTA WOULD NOT COVER THE FRAME RUST PERFORATION DEFECT. PROPER MANUFACTURING ANTI-CORROSION APPLICATION ALONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY FOR A VEHICLE WITH LOW MILEAGE AND EXEMPLARY OWNER CARE AND TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE.   WHEN I ASKED THE TOYOTA AUTONATION ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER HOW I COULD FIX THE FRAME DAMAGE, HE SAID ONCE PERFORATION OCCURS YOU REALLY CAN'T, BECAUSE WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN ONE LOCATION IS PROBABLY OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FRAME, AND I COULD DUMP (SELL) THE TRUCK. FOR THESE REASONS, I BELIEVE THIS TOYOTA TUNDRA'S FRAME PERFORATION RUST IS DUE TO DEFECTIVE DESIGN, MATERIALS OR WORKMANSHIP DURING IN MANUFACTURE OF THE VEHICLE, AND SHOULD BE REPLACED UNDER THE RECALL.

THE FRAME SECTION THAT JOINS THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL ASSEMBLY IS BADLY ROTTED AND WHEN TAPPED WITH A HAMMER HUNKS OF IT ARE FALLING OFF.   I HAVE BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK TO HERB CHAMBERS, MY DEALER, AND WAS TOLD THAT MY TRUCK DID NOT FIT THE CRITERIA FOR FRAME REPLACEMENT.    IN 2015 I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER FOR ITS RECALL FOR FRAME ROT AND THE TRUCK RECEIVED A FRAME COATING OF RUST PROTECTOR. 2 YEARS LATER  I WAS TOLD BY THE MANAGER OF THE SERVICE AREA THAT THIS COATING WAS A JOKE. TOYOTA FOUND THAT THE COATING NEVER DRIED THEREFORE WOULD HAVE WASHED OFF IN THE NEXT WET DRIVING DAY, SO NO RUST PROTECTION.    WHEN I QUESTIONED TOYOTA CORPORATE WHY THE 06 TUNDRA WASN'T GETTING CALLED BACK WHEN SO MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE.    I LOVE MY TRUCK, IT RUNS GREAT, HAS NO OTHER ISSUES, 259,844 MILES ON IT AND I NEED TO KEEP IT GOING FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR.

        "summary": "EARLIER IN THE YEAR OF 2017, A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST TOYOTA (BRIAN WARNER ET AL. V. TOYOTA MOTOR SALES) WAS SETTLED REGARDING FRAME RUST AND CORROSION. THIS LAWSUIT LED TO THE RECALL OF ALL 2005-2010 TACOMAS, 2007-2008 TUNDRAS, AND 2005-2008 SEQUOIAS. BEING THAT THE SEQUOIAS ARE BASED OFF OF THE TUNDRA IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE RESPECTIVE YEARS OF TUNDRAS WERE NOT INCLUDED WITH THE SEQUOIAS.   THE ARGUMENT FOR THE CASE WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT ANY RUST PROTECTANT PUT ONTO THESE FRAMES AND THEREFORE THEY WERE ROTTING PREMATURELY AND CAUSING SERIOUS DANGER TO THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THEM. I HAVE EVEN READ STORIES OF TRUCKS SNAPPING IN HALF UNDER THEIR OWN WEIGHT WHEN BEING PUT ONTO A LIFT.    I AM THE OWNER OF A 2006 TUNDRA AND AM EXPERIENCING THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM BUT AM NOT COVERED UNDER THIS RECALL. ONE OF THE RACK AND PINION MOUNTS THAT ARE WELDED ONTO THE FRONTMOST CROSSMEMBER OF THE FRAME IS 2/3 ROTTED AWAY AND IS ALMOST TO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL BREAK OFF LEADING TO AN UNSAFE VEHICLE AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY ACCIDENT. THIS IS THE REASON TOYOTA LOST THIS LAWSUIT AND WHY OTHER VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM HAVE BEEN RECALLED. TOYOTA ALSO RECOGNIZED THIS ISSUE IN 2015 WITH A LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN WHICH EXPIRED AND OFFERED NO WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT FOR IT.    I RECENTLY VISITED A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHO WENT UNDER THE VEHICLES AND CLAIMED THAT THE ROT IS SO BAD UNDERNEATH MY TRUCK THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FRAME ENTIRELY IF IT HAD BEEN RECALLED. THEY ALSO GAVE ME DOCUMENTATION OF THIS. ESSENTIALLY MY FRAME IS BEYOND REPAIR AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY. I THEN CONTACTED THE TOYOTA CORPORATE NUMBER AND WAS GIVEN A CASE NUMBER BUT THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IF THE 2006 SEQUOIA WAS INCLUDED WHICH IS BASED OFF OF THE TUNDRA, AND HAS THE EXACT SAME FRAME, WHY WASN'T THE TUNDRA INCLUDED WITH THIS RECALL?",

WHY DOES THIS OCCUR AFTER RUNNING 2+ HOURS??  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS TOWING THE SAME TRAILER AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE ENDING UP GOING ONLY 8 MPH UPHILL AGAIN ON THE HIWAY W/60MPH LIMIT!!

WHEN I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK I NOTICED THAT SOME AREAS OF THE FRAME RAILS WHERE PIECES WERE CONNECTED APPEARED TO BE STARTING TO SEPARATE DUE TO RUSTING.  I CONTACTED A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND TOOK IT IN ON JUNE 20, 2015 FOR THEM TO HAVE A LOOK.  AFTER ONE OF THE TECHS ON SITE LOOKED AT THE TRUCK FRAME HE TOLD HIS MANAGER THAT IF THIS TRUCK CAME INTO THEIR SHOP THEY WOULD HAVE REPLACED THE FRAME AS PART OF A RECALL.  THE MANAGER TOOK SOME PICTURES AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GET BACK TO ME.  AFTER NOT HEARING BACK FOR A COUPLE WEEKS I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT SINCE THE FRAME WAS PREVIOUSLY COATED WITH A PROTECTIVE COATING AS PART OF A TOYOTA RECALL FOR RUSTING FRAMES THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH MORE THEY COULD DO.  I THEN OPENED A CASE WITH TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE DUE TO MY CONCERN OF SAFETY AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE TO TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION ON THIS VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH THE RECALL WAS STILL AND ACTIVE CAMPAIGN.  TOYOTA BASICALLY GAVE ME THE SAME RESPONSE AS THE DEALERSHIP.  I ASKED IF THEY COULD AT LEAST REVIEW THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WAS SAFE FOR DRIVING AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TRUCK WAS RECALLED AND THE FRAME WAS COATED WITH A PROTECTIVE COATING AND THAT WAS BASICALLY THE END OF WHAT THEY COULD OFFER.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE FRAME IS OBVIOUSLY STILL RUSTING SO WHATEVER FIX THEY PERFORMED DID NOT WORK.  WHETHER IT WAS DONE IMPROPERLY OR PERHAPS NOT THE CORRECT DECISION BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THE FRAME TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST GAVE THIS CASE A SECOND EVALUATION CONSIDERING THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS STILL ACTIVE WHEN I HAD IT AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF DRIVING THIS TRUCK CONSIDERING THAT THE FRAME CONTINUES TO RUST.",

CALL TO TOYOTA USA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER YIELDS THE FOLLOWING - TOYOTA STATES THEY TOLD THE DEALERS THAT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE. TOYOTA SAYS THE DEALER SHOULD NOT HAVE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT. LOOKS LIKE TOYOTA CAN NOT GET THE BASICS OF COMMUNICATIONS DOWN. BOTTOM-LINE - TOYOTA IS NOT DOING THE REPAIRS, DOES NOT KNOW WHEN IT WILL AND VEHICLES HAVE TO BE LIMITED IN USE OR NOT USED BASED ON THE TOYOTA \"STRONGLY RECOMMENDS\" STATEMENT TO NOT ALLOW PASSENGERS.  NOW I HAVE TO WAIT AND HOPE SOMEONE FROM TOYOTA CONTACTS US WHEN THE PARTS ARE THERE AS I HAVE FULFILLED MY PART TO CONTACT TOYOTA AND RETURN THE TRUCK.",

TOYOTA FELT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO APPLY SOME TYPE OF COMPOUND TO THE FRAME.  *10/15/2015 BF    IN MAY 2015 I LOOKED UNDER MY TRUCK AND NOTICED THAT THE RUST WAS COMING BACK WITH A VENGEANCE, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE RUST WAS HEAVIEST BEFORE.      I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE FRAME WAS DRIED, BRUSH, AND THEN THE COMPOUND \"RUST PROOFING\" WAS APPLIED THAT THE RUST WOULD BE COMING THROUGH/BACK IN LESS THEN A YEAR.      I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA AND THEY DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.  I FIND IT DISHEARTENING THAT THE BODY, ENGINE, AND THE REST OF THE TRUCK WILL OUTLAST THE FRAME.  RUST DOES HAPPEN IN THE NORTH.  HOWEVER, FRAMES DO NOT TURN TO DUST BEFORE THE FENDERS AND THE BODY.  HOW IS IT THE BODY IS LASTING LONGER AND WEARING BETTER?  THOSE PARTS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME ELEMENTS AS THE FRAME!    ESSENTIALLY, TOYOTA TRIED TO PUT MAKEUP OR A BAND-AID ON THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM.  IF YOU JUST PAINT OR COVER RUST WITHOUT TREATING THE RUST TO BEGIN WITH, THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER FIXED.  IF YOU SAND THE RUST DOWN/OUT, THEN APPLY YOUR PAINT OR COMPOUND, YOU WILL EXTEND THE LIFE OF YOUR METAL.      I HAVE TRIED TO BRING THIS ISSUE UP WITH TOYOTA AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.  THEY STATE THE ISSUE IS CLOSED AND NOTHING ELSE WILL BE DONE.     AFTER SOME RESEARCH IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT TOYOTA'S MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND STANDARDS FOR SECOND GENERATION TUNDRA ARE NO DIFFERENT THEN THE FIRST.      IF TOYOTA CAN NOT OR DID NOT WANT TO BUILD A VEHICLE FOR COLD ENVIRONMENTS THAT USE SALT, THEY SHOULD NOT SELL THEM TO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES.

TO MY SURPRISE THE BALL JOINTS HEAD SEPARATED FROM THE SUSPENSION, THE LEFT BOTTOM FRONT SUSPENSION WAS DRAGGING THE HIGHWAY AND THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL WAS NOW STUCK UNDER THE RUNNING BOARD.  THIS ACCIDENT ALSO DAMAGED THE LEFT FRONT BUMPER, THE LEFT FRONT FENDER AND THE LEFT FRONT DOOR. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS TRAUMATIZED. I SAW NO WARNING THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. I KEPT MY TRUCK IN IMMACULATE CONDITION AND HAD REGULARLY MAINTENANCE DONE AT THIS TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.    WE DECIDED TO DO A SEARCH ON THE WEB TO SEE IF ANY RECALLS EXISTED AND THERE IS A RECALL ON THE 2006 TOYOTA TUNDRA FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE.  HOWEVER WHEN I CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE AND PROVIDED MY VIN NUMBER - LOW AND BEHOLD MY TRUCK WAS NOT IN THAT RECALL (MY VIN# MISSED IT BY 15 DAYS).    THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE ASKED ME TO TAKE MY TRUCK TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND GET A WRITTEN ESTIMATE.  AT MY OWN EXPENSE, I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED AND AFTER ABOUT TWO DAYS MY REPAIR EXPENSES WERE DENIED BY TOYOTA.  HOWEVER, I WAS OFFERED $750 TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF A NEW TOYOTA FOR BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER.  I PURCHASED THREE NEW VEHICLES FROM THIS TOYOTA DEALERSHIP (2006, 2007, & 2008).

THEY CHANGED THE WAY IT IS CONFIGURED IN THE NEWER MODELS AND ISSUED A RECALL FOR THOSE BUT REFUSE TO FIX THE OLDER MODELS. THIS IS A CLEAR LACK OF SAFETY ON THEIR PART. IF THIS WAS TO OCCUR ON THE INTERSTATE THEN PEOPLE WILL GET HURT. I ASK YOU TO SEEK OUT TOYOTA FOR THE SAFETY OF DRIVERS AND MAKE THEM RECALL THESE PARTS. *TR",

I PUT ON THE BRAKE AND IT STILL DIDN'T STOP ACCELERATING, ONLY WHEN I TRIED AGAIN AND PUT THE BRAKE ON AS HARD AS I COULD, I HEARD A \"POP\" NOISE AND THE ACCELERATOR WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  I DIDN'T TAKE MY TRUCK IN TO BE REPAIRED RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I HAD IT FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS AND IT NEVER DID THAT BEFORE AND IT ONLY DID IT WHEN I PUNCHED THE GAS PEDAL.  I ALSO HAD NO EYE WITNESSES AND DIDN'T TRUST THE DEALER.  SO I TRIED TO REPRODUCE THE ACCELERATION 3 OR 4 MORE TIMES SUCCESSFULLY DURING LIGHT TRAFFIC AND WITH WITNESSES, EACH TIME WHEN I PUT ON THE BRAKE VERY HARD I HEARD A \"POP\" AND THE ACCELERATOR WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  BEFORE I TOOK MY TRUCK TO THE DEALER ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER I WENT ON THE FREEWAY DURING LIGHT TRAFFIC TO SEE HOW FAST THE TUNDRA WOULD GO AND IF IT WOULD STOP BY ITSELF.  THE TRUCK ACCELERATED TO ABOUT 75 MPH AND MADE THE \"POP\" SOUND AND WENT BACK TO NORMAL WITHOUT PUTTING ON THE BRAKE.  I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT I HAD WITNESSES.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD CHECK IT OUT AND SEEMED LIKE THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT.  WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER TO PICK UP MY TRUCK I BROUGHT MY WIFE.  THE SERVICE REP. TOOK ME ASIDE SO MY WIFE COULDN'T HEAR AND TOLD ME \"OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, UNOFFICIALLY IT DID WHAT YOU SAID\".  THEN HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT THE OLD ACCELERATORS USED TO USE CABLES TO GIVE THE ENGINE MORE GAS, BUT THE NEW ACCELERATORS LIKE MINE USE A VACUUM SYSTEM TO GIVE THE ENGINE MORE GAS.  HE SAID THAT MY VACUUM SYSTEM HAD GOTTEN DIRTY INSIDE, THEY CLEANED IT OUT AND THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

WHILE I WAS STANDING ON THE BRAKE, THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES WERE ENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE KEPT BEING PROPELLED INTO THE INTERSECTION, WHERE I RAN INTO AN ARMORED VAN.  I WAS TICKETED FOR FAILURE TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN.  THERE WERE 3 PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLE, MY WIFE, SON, AND MYSELF.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  THIS HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

THAT IS WHEN I PURCHASED IT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME I DIDN'T HAVE REPAIR ORDERS WRITTEN UP. I AM NOT ON THE RECALL LIST AND THAT'S FINE. BUT REGARDLESS I WANT MY VEHICLE FIXED. I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT IN OCT. 2009 DUE TO SUA. I REPORTED IT TO MY DEALER AND MY INSURANCE CARRIER. THE VEHICLE WAS LOOKED AT BY A FACTORY REP. IT WAS DECIDED BY TOYOTA THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. I WAS TOLD BY TOYOTA TO GET AN ESTIMATE ON REPAIRS. THAT WAS A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF JUST UNDER $2000.00. I WAS TOLD NOT TO HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE UNTIL I HEARD FROM TOYOTA. TO THIS DAY OF MARCH 5, 2010 THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED. I CHOSE NOT TO HAVE THE TRUCK FIXED BECAUSE I WAS HOPING TOYOTA WOULD, AS MR. BURTON FROM TEXAS TOLD JIM LENTZ, \"IF YOU KNOW WHERE A VEHICLE IS THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED GO GET THAT VEHICLE, I DON'T CARE IF IT COST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS, GO GET THAT VEHICLE.

AFTER THE COLLISION WITH THE POLARIS I DROVE MY VEHICLE HOME. THE NEXT DAY I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO TIM'S TOYOTA IN PRESCOTT AZ. WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED. THEY LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD CALL FOR A FACTORY REP. TO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE. THIS WAS TO BE ON NOV. 9, 2009. I DID DRIVE MY VEHICLE TO YARNELL AZ FOR DEER SEASON. I DROVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO PRESCOTT TO MEET WITH THE FACTORY REP. HE DID WHATEVER THEY DO AND SAID HE HAD ALL THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED. HE ALSO TOLD ME TO GO AHEAD AND GET AN ESTIMATE FOR THE REPAIRS BUT NOT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED UNTIL I HEARD FROM TOYOTA. THE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE IS JUST SHY OF $2000.00. THIS ESTIMATE WAS GIVEN TO JEFF LOCKE TO BE SENT TO TOYOTA. MY QUESTION TO ALL OF THIS IS, WHY DID TOYOTA ALLOW ME TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AFTER THE MEETING, WHEN THEY KNOW THAT I AM DRIVING A TIME BOMB. ALSO WHY HASN'T NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY INVOLVED ITSELF INTO AN INVESTIGATION OF ITS OWN? I NOW KNOW THE VERBIAGE FOR THE INCIDENT. IT IS CALLED \" SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION\" WHICH IS TIED TOGETHER WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL, THROTTLE BODY AND OTHER ELECTRICAL, VACUUM CONTROLLED , MECHANICAL UNITS. LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELVES. IT WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS CONDITION. MY VEHICLE SITS IN MY GARAGE SO ANYTIME NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY WANTS TO DO AN INVESTIGATION IS FINE WITH ME. TOYOTA HAS NOT DONE A PROPER EVALUATION OF THE ISSUE. MY INSURANCE COMPANY IS BEHIND ME 100% AND IS NOW GOING TO CONTACT TOYOTA TO TRY TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR \"SUDDEN ACCELERATION\" AND CRUISE CONTROL UNITS TO BEHAVE THE WAY THAT THEY ARE. RACING TO OVER 5000 RPM'S AND HUNTING GEARS THE WAY THEY DO IS JUST NOT THE WAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO OPERATE. TOYOTA WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT A FLOOR MAT IS AT FAULT AND NOW THE WHOLE PEDAL ASSEMBLY. OR IS IT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE GAS FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL? *TR",

WE  TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A BRIDGESTONE TIRE DEALER BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE WEAR ON  OUTSIDE EDGE OF BOTH FRONT TIRES. THE VEHICLE CAME NEW WITH BRIDGESTONE TIRES. THE BRIDGESTONE TIRE DEALER TOLD US THAT BOTH FRONT TIRES SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY REPLACED BECAUSE THE OUTSIDE EDGES WERE WORN TO THE SUBSTRATE. WE WERE SURPRISED BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY 7,350 MILES ON IT.  THE BRIDGESTONE TIRE DEALER SUGGESTED THAT WE TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALER AND HAVE THEM INSPECT THE FRONT-END ALIGNMENT. THE TOYOTA DEALER AGREED TO DO SO AND INFORMED US THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE RECALL WORK ASSOCIATED WITH SSC 70B AND THAT AS PART OF THAT PROCEDURE, THE FRONT-END ALIGNMENT WOULD BE CHECKED BEFORE AND AFTER THE RECALL WORK. AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED THE ALIGNMENT REPORT CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE FRONT WHEELS HAD THE INCORRECT \"TOE\" ADJUSTMENT ON BOTH FRONT WHEELS. WE HAVE RETAINED COPIES OF THAT REPORT.  THE SERVICE CONSULTANT SUGGESTED THAT WE CONTACT THE SERVICE MANAGER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEALERSHIP WOULD PROVIDE SOME SORT OF DISCOUNT ON THE COST TO REPLACE BOTH TIRES.

THE VEHICLE LEFT THE TOYOTA FACTORY WITH THE FRONT-END OUT OF ALIGNMENT.    2. EXCESSIVE WEAR OF BOTH FRONT TIRES WAS CAUSED BY THE IMPROPER \"TOE\" ADJUSTMENT WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN AN ARTIFACT OF THE RECALL WORK THAT REQUIRED REPLACING THE FRONT SUSPENSION LOWER BALL JOINTS.

I TOOK NO IMMEDIATE ACTION AS I FOUND IT TO BE A VERY LIGHT SOUND. AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF DRIVING THE KNOCK BECAME MORE NOTICEABLE I WAS MORE ALARMED, WHEN I GOT HOME I GOT UNDER MY TRUCK WITH A FLASHLIGHT AND STARTED TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND, AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION I FOUND THAT 3 OF 4 12MM HEX BOLTS ON THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MOUNT/ CROSSMEMBER WERE MISSING FURTHER MORE THE CASE WAS THAT THE REAR TRANSMISSION MOUNT LOCATED NEAR THE DRIVESHAFT WERE LOOSE ENOUGH THAT COULD BE MOVED WITH MINIMAL STRENGTH WITH MY HAND I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER 1 BOLT THAT FELL INTO THE CROSSMEMBER ALONG WITH A PLASTIC RETAINER. I QUICKLY TIGHTENED THE LOOSE BOLTS AND REALIGNED THE MOUNT TOOK THE TRUCK OUT FOR A QUICK TEST DRIVE AND THE SOUND STOPPED TOTALLY,  THE NEXT MORNING I CONTACTED MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER AND PURCHASED 2 NEW HEX BOLTS THAT CAME OUT TO $ 3.40. AFTER THIS U CAN SAY THAT ALL IS NOW WELL, I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO AS THERE MAYBE OTHER SIMILAR UNITS OUT THERE WITH THE SAME ISSUE, THIS COULD CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND ALSO POSSIBLE INFLICT AN ACCIDENT.  *NM",

BOOSTER SEATS DON'T REQUIRE A LATCH SYSTEM BUT HIS WEIGHT IS BELOW WHAT IS CONSIDERED SAFE FOR AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT. MY SCENARIO IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CUTOFF SWITCH WAS INTENDED FOR, MY 6 YEAR OLD OCCASIONALLY RIDING IN THE FRONT WITH ME.

TRUCK BEGAN HESITATING OR STUMBLING FOR ABOUT 30 SEC., THEN SMOOTHED OUT.      SATURDAY 4/15 /06    TURNED RIGHT AND BEGAN ACCELERATING UP AN INCLINE WITH FULL LOAD OF PASSENGERS.  TRUCK BEGAN STUMBLING; ACTING LIKE IT WAS NOT GETTING FUEL, UPON COMING TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT, IT STALLED WHEN I CAME TO A STOP.  NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, IT WAS LIKE I HAD TURNED OFF THE KEY.  MANAGED TO GET IT STARTED, AND IT RAN THE REST OF THAT EVENING WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  THIS OCCURRED ABOUT 6:00 P.M. AND THE AIR TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE LOW 80S.    TUESDAY 4/18/06    WAS DRIVING AROUND THE BALTIMORE BELTWAY AT SPEED, WHEN THE ENGINE BEGAN MISSING AT A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH.  THIS CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST TWO, AND POSSIBLY THREE MINUTES.  TRAFFIC SUDDENLY CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  AT THIS POINT, THE ENGINE DIED, AND AGAIN THERE WAS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, THE ENGINE JUST TURNED OFF.    4/19/06  ON THE DRIVE FROM OWINGS MILLS TO WALDORF, I NEEDED TO PASS A TRUCK TOWING A BOAT.  AS I PRESSED ON THE GAS, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO STUMBLE AGAIN AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  *JB",

THIS WILL BRING RPMS FROM 2000 TO 3000.  THIS IS MERELY ANNOYING.  SOMETIMES WILL KICK DOWN PAST DRIVE AND INTO 3RD GEAR, BRINGING RPMS TO 5000 AND CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO ACCELERATE RAPIDLY ON HILL.  THIS SEEMS UNSAFE, ESPECIALLY IN CROWDED OR WET CONDITIONS.  HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER TUNDRA OWNERS ONLINE.  ALL SAY DEALER AND TOYOTA CLAIM THIS IS \"NORMAL.\"   TOYOTA CORPORATE OFFICE TOLD ME THEY CONSIDER THIS \"NORMAL\" AND RECOMMEND I NOT USE CRUISE CONTROL IN HILLY AREAS.   MUST NOT HAVE HILLY AREAS WHERE TOYOTA ENGINEERS LIVE.  *NM",

WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED WITH CRUISE CONTROL ON AND APPROACHING A SLIGHT INCLINE, THE VEHICLE WILL DROP INTO PASSING GEAR AND THE THROTTLE WILL GO TO FULL THROTTLE.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE OPERATOR TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY ON A RAIN SLICK ROAD.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES, AND ALTHOUGH I AM AWARE THAT IT COULD HAPPEN, IT STILL STARTLES ME WHEN IT OCCURS.  IF CLOSE BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, THIS COULD LEAD TO AN REAR END ACCIDENT.  THE NORMAL PROGRESSION SHOULD BE DROPPING OUT OF OVERDRIVE, WITH A GRADUAL ACCELERATION TO MAINTAIN SET SPEED, AND THEN BACK TO OVERDRIVE WHEN SET SPEED IS OBTAINED.  DEALER CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY CLAIMED THIS IS NORMAL OPERATION.  DOCUMENTED WITH TOYOTA DEALER, AND NOW WITH NHTSA.  WHEN ACCIDENT OCCURS AS A RESULT OF THIS OVERSPEED, HOPEFULLY TOYOTA WILL RESET THE COMPUTER CONTROL MODULE TO FIX PROBLEM. *JB",
