I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THE MOTOR HOME WAS NOT SLOWING AS IT SHOULD WITH THIS AMOUNT OF FOOT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY TURN INTO A PARKING LOT AND THE MOTOR HOME STOPPED DUE TO AN INCLINE.  I HAD MY SON GET INTO THE DRIVERS SEAT AND KEEP HIS FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS I PLACED WHEEL CHOCKS ON THE VEHICLE.  AS IT TURNS OUT, THE AUTO PARK BRAKE HAD FAILED AS WELL (MULTIPLE FAILURES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS). THE MECHANIC STATES THAT THIS BRAKE FAILURE APPEARS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE BRAKE ISSUES EXPERIENCE BY WORKHORSE W SERIES CHASSIS'S THAT ARE INVOLVED IN A BRAKE RECALL CAMPAIGN. PART FAILURE IS REAR BRAKE CALIPERS.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICED MULTIPLE INTERNET COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE WORKHORSE CHASSIS AUTO PARK BRAKE AS BEING A CONSTANT PROBLEM.  MY MOTOR HOME HAS HAD MULTIPLE AUTO PARKING BRAKE FAILURES IN EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  THE VEHICLE MILEAGE IS AN ESTIMATE SINCE IT IS STILL IN THE SHOP BEING REPAIRED AGAIN.      *JS",
