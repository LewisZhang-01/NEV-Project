IT BECAME AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE THAT I WOULD THINK WENT AWAY AND THEN WOULD HAPPEN RANDOMLY. I DECIDED TO BRING MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT IN OCTOBER OF 2014, WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS MY NEEDING A NEW WIN MODULE. HOWEVER, AFTER THAT REPLACEMENT, THE ISSUE CONTINUED. THE ISSUE HAPPENS WHENEVER IT FEELS LIKE HAPPENING. WHETHER THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION AND I AM DRIVING OR IF I AM SITTING IN MY OFFICE BUILDING, A DISTANCE AWAY FROM MY CAR, WITH MY KEYS AT MY DESK. MY KEYS CAN BE IN THE IGNITION, OR OUT OF THE IGNITION. IT DOESN'T MATTER. MY CAR DOES AS IT PLEASES, WHEN IT PLEASES. AGAIN, THE LOCKS, WIPERS, AND WINDSHIELD FLUID JUST START GOING ON THEIR OWN. THE HORN ALSO GOES, BUT I HAVE REMOVED THE HORN FUSES SO I DO NOT HONK AT RANDOM PEOPLE WHEN I AM DRIVING. SOME FORUMS SAY THIS IS A TIPM ISSUE. SOME SAY IT IS AN IGNITION MODULE ISSUE. SOME SAY IT HAS TO DO WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR WIRING. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE REASON IS. I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS \"FIXING\" THIS ISSUE BUT IT IS STILL HAPPENING.

WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE VAN HE PUT IN THE DRY GAS AND HE DECIDED TO TRY TO TURN THE VAN ON AND IT TURNED OVER. WE WENT HOME AFTER THAT.  AFTER THAT THE VAN SEEMS TO WORK FOR A WHILE, THEN ONE DAY MY HUSBAND CAME HOME FROM WORK AND TRIED TO SHUT THE VAN OFF, BUT IT WOULD NOT SHUT OFF. THE HORN STARTED BLOWING AND THE WIPES, WIPER FLUID, LIGHTS AND DOOR LOCKS WERE ALL WORKING ALL BY THEMSELVES. WE UNATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY BUT THAT DID NOT WORK AND FINALLY STARTED PULLING FUSES UNTIL IT ALL STOPPED. HE DROVE TO WORK WITHOUT THE FUSES UNTIL WE COULD GET IT FIXED. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS A RECALL AROUND MAY 2015. WE BROUGHT THE VAN INTO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE IGNITION MODULE AND GAVE US NEW KEY FOBS.   THE VAN STALLED AGAIN ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK AND WE CALLED AAA TO GET THE VAN AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY SAID THAT THEY CHECKED ALL THE ELECTRIC AND RAN A PURGE MONITOR TEST AND OTHERS. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH THE VAN AND CHARGED US $200.    JUST RECENTLY WE WERE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC AT AROUND 20 MILES PER HOUR AND THE VAN STALLED AGAIN. THIS TIME WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO MOVE IT AND A TRUCK DRIVER HELPED TO PUSH US OUT OF TRAFFIC.

AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SMELL WENT AWAY AND WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. 7/8/15 MULTIPLE LIGHTS SHOW UP AFTER STARTING THE VAN..ABS, BRAKES, TRACTION CONTROL, ETC. TWO DAYS LATER THESE LIGHTS WENT AWAY. 7/18/15 WE GOT INTO THE VAN AND A/C IN THE BACK WAS BLOWING, BUT THE FRONT WASN'T BLOWING AT ALL. TURNED IT ON WHILE DRIVING AND IT WORKED AGAIN. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I WENT TO WORK THE BLOWER WAS NOT BLOWING ANYMORE, BUT WORKED ON THE WAY HOME.  AFTER THAT SECOND DAY IT HAS CONSISTENTLY WORKED.  THIS MORNING WHEN I HIT THE UNLOCK BUTTON ON THE KEYFOB THE HORN STARTED HONKING, WINDSHIELD WIPERS WENT ON, AND WIPER FLUID WAS SQUIRTING OUT. I GOT INTO THE VAN AND STARTED IT AND EVERYTHING STOPPED. I DROVE THE 20 MINUTE DRIVE HOME FROM WORK WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. LATER THAT DAY I GOT BACK INTO THE VAN TO DRIVE  AND EVERYTHING WAS STILL NORMAL EXCEPT I HAD A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SO I PLANNED ON GETTING THAT CHECKED WHILE I WAS OUT.  I WAS PARKED AT A RESIDENCE WITH THE VAN STILL ON WHEN THE SAME HORN/WIPER/WIPER FLUID PROBLEM STARTED UP AGAIN. I TURNED OFF THE VAN AND IT KEPT GOING. I PULLED FUSES OUT FOR THE HORN/WIPERS/FLUID AND COULD STILL HEAR THINGS IN THE BOX CLICKING. THIS TIME THE DOOR LOCKS WERE LOCKING BY THEMSELVES AND THE LIGHTS (BOTH INSIDE AND OUT) WERE TURNING OFF AND ON. I DROVE TO THE CLOSES AUTO PARTS STORE AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE 2 CODES COMING UP.  IT GAVE ME P0685 (ASD RELAY CIRCUIT FAILURE) AND P0883 (TCM POWER INPUT HIGH). AFTER DOING SOME ONLINE RESEARCH IT SEEMS I HAVE TO HAVE MY TIPM REPLACED AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM.  I'M FRUSTRATED AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I KEEP HAVING TO PUT INTO THIS VAN.  RIGHT NOW MY VAN IS SITTING IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE WITH THE BATTERY DISCONNECTED UNTIL I CAN TAKE IT IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  I'M REALLY LUCKY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN ON MY DRIVE TO/FROM WORK.",

THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AWHILE, THEN RECALL COME OUT SAYING IT'S THE ENGINE SWITCH, SO NOW WE ARE WAITING ON THE IT, STILL... WHEN I HAVE DID SOME RESEARCH AND ASK SOME PEOPLE WITH COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE ON VEHICLES AND THEY SAY BY THE ENGINE CUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING CAN CAUSE ISSUES WITH THE TIPM PART (COMPUTER).  I HAVE TAKEN IT SO MANY TIMES TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THIS REASON FOR THE ENGINE SHUTTING IT SELF OFF, THEY WOULD BRUSH IT OFF IT'S THE BATTERY, GOT NEW BATTERY THEN IT HAPPEN AGAIN. THEN TOOK IT BACK AGAIN , NO ENGINE LIGHT ON , THEN THEY CAN'T DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES. NOW WARRANTY IS OUT.. STILL NO PART FOR THE RECALL ENGINE SWITCH.... 2015.

THEIR TECHNICIAN DROVE THE VAN AROUND, DID SOME OTHER INSPECTION AND REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH MY TRANSMISSION. HOWEVER HE MENTIONED THERE WAS A ELECTRICAL POWER LOSS WHICH MADE MY VAN GO INTO LIMP MODE. REMARKABLY MY VAN STARTED DRIVING NORMALLY AFTER THE INSPECTION. I TOOK MY VAN TO AUTHORIZED DODGE DEALER. THEY PULLED SOME CODES FROM THE COMPUTER WHICH INDICATED POWER LOSS TO SEVERAL EQUIPMENT. THEY SUSPECTED THE TIPM MODULE, BUT DID NOT HAVE HARD EVIDENCE FROM THE CODES. THEY ADVISED ME TO LEAVE VAN OVERNIGHT AT THE SERVICE AREA, AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT OUT. I DECLINED BECAUSE ARRANGING ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION WAS DIFFICULT. TODAY MORNING, WHILE DRIVING THE VAN, WIPER BLADE SUDDENLY STARTED RUNNING. IT STOPPED ON ITS OWN AFTER FEW CYCLES. NOW I AM UNABLE TO START THE VAN. READING THROUGH FORUMS WHERE DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ISSUES, I AM CONFIDENT IT IS THE TIPM ON MY VAN. IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE, SINCE I DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY A LOT, AND IF VAN GOES INTO LIMP MODE, IT WILL BE A HAZARD. LOOKS LIKE DODGE IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE. WHY DON'T THEY ACCEPT THE SITUATION AND DEAL WITH IT BY ISSUING A SAFETY RECALL AND FIXING THE TIPM. PLEASE FORCE DODGE TO ISSUE RECALL, ELSE I WILL NEED TO SPEND $1000 ATLEAST TO FIX TIPM.  *TR",

THESE EPISODES COULD OCCUR IN RAPID SUCCESSION, SEPARATED BY ONLY A FEW SECONDS, OR THEY MIGHT HAVE 5-10 MINUTES OR SOMETIMES DAYS BETWEEN HAPPENINGS. THIS WOULD CAUSE SUDDEN LOSS OF VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING, AS THE SPRAYERS WOULD COVER THE WINDSHIELD WITH DROPS BUT THE WIPERS WOULD NOT COMPLETE A PASS TO REMOVE THE FLUID. IT WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS AT NIGHT, SINCE THE DROPS WOULD REFRACT LIGHT AND MAKE VISIBILITY ALMOST ZERO.

WHILE THE PROBLEMS WERE HAPPENING, THE REMOTE \"CLICKER\" COULD NOT BE USED TO UNLOCK OR OPEN DOORS OR LIFT-GATE.

I COULDN'T TURN IT OFF OR ON OR DO ANYTHING FOR MINUTES AT A TIME.  THE CAR POWER WOULD SUDDENLY TURN BACK ON  IT'S OWN.  SO, ONCE AGAIN, I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER.  THIS TIME THEY DID A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO SEVERAL MODULES.  I JUST RECEIVED THE CAR BACK FROM THAT VISIT ON 12/17/14.  THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS.  ON 12/22/14, I LOST POWER IN THE CAR WHILE DRIVING AT A NORMAL SPEED (30 MPH) GOING DOWN A HILL.  THE POWER STEERING AND BRAKES WENT OUT AND I HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE CAR TO A STOP.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES TO SLOW THE CAR AND PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL.  SINCE THEN, I'VE LOST POWER TWICE WHEN STOPPED AT STOP LIGHTS.  I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TURN THE KEY OFF AND THEN BACK ON.  I CALLED THE DEALER AGAIN.  THEY SAID THAT IT'S MOST LIKELY RELATED TO A RECALL AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE PARTS.  THEY ADVISED ME TO REMOVE ALL OTHER KEYS AND RINGS FROM THE IGNITION KEY.  EVEN AFTER THAT, I STILL LOST POWER ONCE SO FAR.  *TR",

TODAY, 10/29/14, I PARKED MY VAN AT WINN-DIXIE AND WENT INSIDE TO SHOP. WHEN I RETURNED TO LEAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS EXHIBITED AND FINALLY THE VAN STARTED. I CALLED MY DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECALL ON MY KEY FOB ELECTRONIC SHIFTER RECALL, BUT THERE WERE NO PARTS AVAILABLE YET. I WAS ALSO ASKED IF THERE WAS AN ENGINE LIGHT THAT WENT ON AND I SAID NO. I WAS TOLD THAT THEN THEY COULD NOT CHECK ON THEIR COMPUTERS FOR THE PROBLEM UNLESS THE \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" HAD EXHIBITED. SO, HERE I AM--------------------WHAT SHOULD I DO?????  *TR",

HOWEVER THE BRAKES WERE NEW INCLUDING ROTORS 2 WEEKS PRIOR AND UPON HAVING MY OWN INSPECTION DONE THE BRAKES WERE FOUND IN WORKING ORDER, NO WARPED ROTORS OR BURNT PADS THAT WOULD SUGGEST A BRAKE LOCK UP AT 65MPH,TIRES(SNOW TIRES AS MY SON WAS HEADING TO COLLEGE IN NORTHERN MAINE ) ARE IN GOOD CONDITION WITH NO EVIDENCE OF FLAT AREAS (AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT WITH BRAKES LOCKING UP) WE HAD ENGINE DIAGNOSTICS CHECKED AND FOUND AN YAW WARNING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WITH NO OTHER ENGINE CODES NOTED. ALL ENGINE LIGHTS WERE LIT UP AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SHUT THE IGNITION OFF WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION ONLY TO RESET UPON NORMAL RESTART.   *TR",

THE REASON I AM WRITING THE NHTSA IS THE NEWLY REPLACED WIN MODULE IS CLEARLY A REDESIGNED PART. IT LOOKS AND FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OLD, FAULTY WIN MODULE. IF DODGE REDESIGNED THE PART, THEY MUST HAVE ASSUMED THE EARLIER DESIGN WAS DEFECTIVE IN SOME WAY. TO JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR A REDESIGN, THERE HAD TO BE SOME DRIVING FACTOR LIKE IMPROVED SAFETY. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS DEFECT HAD THE REAL POTENTIAL OF CAUSING DEATH AND I AM REQUESTING THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER. AM I THE FIRST TO HAVE LODGED A COMPLAINT REGARDING THIS PART?

TWO MONTHS AFTER I SAW THE ENGINE LIGHT ON THE SCREEN, WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY KEEP THE CAR FOR 3 DAYS WHILE THEY MADE A REPAIR THAT COST ME $850.0, I MADE THIS PAYMENT BECAUSE I TRUST THEM WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE ONLY REPAIR. WEEKS AFTER I WAS ON THE HIGH WAY WITH MY WHOLE FAMILY AND I SAY SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE AND WE PERCEIVED A STRONG BURN SMELL, THE MILEAGE ON THAT TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 67,000, WE JUST MADE IT TO ARRIVE TO THE DEALER SERVICE AND THEY FOUND A VERY LOW COOLANT LEVEL WHICH MEANS THAT THE OVERHEATING WAS RELATED TO THE COOLANT LINE. NEXT DAY I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SERVICE, THE CAR WAS THERE FOR 7 DAYS AFTER I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR NEEDS AN ENGINE CHANGE WHICH I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY. THE DEALER CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER BUT ALL I RECEIVED FROM THEM WERE 8 OIL CHANGES. I RECEIVED AND OFFER TO HAVE ANOTHER CAR BUT THE TRADE VALUE FOR MY CAR IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL PRICE I PAID AND THE NEW MONTHLY PAYMENT IS OUT OF MY POSSIBILITIES. I'M DRIVING THIS CAR TAKING THE RISK FOR MY FAMILY WITH THE WINTER COMING. AFTER READING THE COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT I'M NOT THE FIRST OWNER OF A 2008 GRAND CARAVAN WITH A POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF OVERHEATING AND FIRE ON MY CAR.

CHRYSLER KNOWS IT IS AN ISSUE, BUT THEY WILL NOT OFFER AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION.  THEY BLAME IT ON OUR DRIVING STYLE, BUT THAT IS NOT CORRECT.  WE CURRENTLY OWN A FORD TAURUS WHICH IS DRIVEN MORE THAN THE VAN, AND THE BRAKES LAST 40,000 MILES PLUS.  WE HAVE OWNED 10-15 CARS IN OUR DRIVING LIFE, AND THEY ALL HAVE THE BRAKES REPLACED AROUND 40,000 MILES.  THE CARAVAN ALSO HAS TO HAVE THE REAR BRAKES CHANGED QUITE OFTEN, WHICH TYPICALLY ONLY HAPPENS 1 TIME IN THE 100,000 MILE LIFE OF OUR OTHER CARS.  I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH FOR \"BRAKE LIFE EXPECTANCY\", AND THE THIRD LINK PULLED UP WAS THE FOLLOWING FORUM WHERE MANY OTHER DRIVERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE.    HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F1BBE4A    JUST WANTED TO PASS ALONG MY CONCERNS.  THANKS!!  *TR",

WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY ASKED IF WE NOTICED THE OIL LEAKING, WE SAID NO. THEY SAID IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE WE DOCUMENT THE MILEAGE AND TOP THE OIL OFF AND HAVE YOU COME BACK UP TO 1000 MILES LATER. SO WE DID. WE DID THIS SEVERAL TIMES. THE DEALERSHIP ADMITTED THIS SHOULDN'T BE OCCURRING AND THE VEHICLE IS DEFINITELY BURNING TOO MUCH OIL. THEY KEPT THE VAN MADE A CLAIM WITH NAC OUR VAN WARRANTY COMPANY TO PAY FOR EXPENSES OF REPAIR, AND NAC SENT BACK A REPORT SAYING CHRYSLER VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED TO BURN UP TO A QUART TO A QUART AND A HALF OF OIL FOR EVERY 750 MILES DRIVEN. SO THEY SENT US AWAY WITHOUT REPAIRS. LITERALLY LESS THAN A WEEK AND ABOUT 550 MILES LATER WE WERE BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP WITH MORE THAN 2 QUARTS OF OIL DOCUMENTED BEING BURNED. THE DEALERSHIP KEPT OUR VAN FOR REPAIRS AGAIN...THE WARRANTY REFUSED TO PAY FOR REPAIRS AND WE ARE DRIVING THE VAN AS IS...IM NOT SURE OF THE SAFETY ISSUES BUT IM SURE THERE ARE MANY THAT CAN BE ASSESSED.

THANKFULLY I WAS THEN ABLE TO USE MY BARE FOOT TO GET IN CONTROL OF THE PEDALS AGAIN. I STOPPED THE VAN TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A CLAMP OF SOME KIND TO THE RIGHT OF THE GAS PEDAL AND MY SHOESTRING WAS CAUGHT IN IT. IN MY OPINION THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF I HAD BEEN BUMPER TO BUMPER IN THE CITY WHEN THIS HAPPENED I WOULD HAVE LIKELY REAR ENDED SOMEONE.

IN FACT, THEY BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON THE EPA NO LONGER ALLOWING ASBESTOS IN THE BRAKES.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, WHY ISN'T EVERYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD REPLACING BRAKES AT THIS ASTRONOMICAL RATE?

THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LEFT REAR CALIPER 'HUNG UP' ON THE BRAKE.  THEY SAID THAT THE CALIPER ADAPTER WAS NEW TO THIS MODEL (2008), THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE AND THAT CHRYSLER HAS A NEWER DESIGN BUT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE PADS, CALIPERS AND ROTORS ON BOTH REAR BRAKES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THEY CLEANED AND LUBRICATED THE BRAKES AND I CONTINUED TO CHICAGO TO HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE THERE.      LATER MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT IN APRIL 2011, THE SAME THING HAD HAPPENED BUT ON THE RIGHT REAR BRAKE.  AGAIN THIS WAS ON THE INTERSTATE.  SHE HEARD A VERY LOUD SQUEALING.  AFTER TAPPING THE BRAKES A FEW TIMES THE SOUND WENT AWAY AND SHE CONTINUED.  THIS IS WHY THE DEALER SAID THAT THE RIGHT REAR BRAKE PADS, CALIPERS AND ROTOR ALSO NEEDED REPLACEMENT.    WORSE, MY DAUGHTER'S BROTHER-IN-LAW BOUGHT THE SAME MODEL CARAVAN IN 2008.  ON A TRIP TO VIRGINIA, ALSO ON THE INTERSTATE, THEIR BRAKES SEIZED IN THE SAME MANNER.    WHEN WE GOT TO CHICAGO, I TOOK THE VAN INTO ROESCH CHRYSLER IN ELMHURST ILLINOIS.  THEY REPLACED THE CALIPERS UNDER WARRANTY BUT CHARGED ME TO REPLACE THE PADS AND ROTORS.    THE FACT THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE ON MY DAUGHTER'S VAN, THAT IT ALSO HAPPENED ON HER BROTHER-IN-LAW'S SAME MODEL/YEAR VAN, THAT THE CALIPER DESIGN WAS NEW IN 2008, THAT SINCE THEN A NEW CALIPER DESIGN HAS BEEN RELEASED ' LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL CALIPER/BRAKE DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  MOREOVER, CHRYSLER SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THESE VEHICLES AS A SAFETY ISSUE GIVEN AN OVER HEATED WHEEL COULD HAVE CAUSED A HIGH SPEED BLOWOUT.",

CURRENT ODOMETER READING 25347  THIS VEHICLE WENT FOR ITS FIRST SERVICE FEBRUARY 9, 2009 TO A VEHICLE CHECK-UP PEACE OF MIND INSPECTION. PRIMARILY WITH AN INQUIRY TO CHECK THE BRAKE SYSTEM SINCE THE BRAKE PEDAL FELT SOMEWHAT SPONGY WHEN APPLIED.     THE INSPECTION INDICATED THE BRAKES PULSATED BECAUSE OF A WARPED DISK. THE WARPED DISK IS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY HIGH HEAT GENERATED FROM PROLONGED BRAKING.    THIS APPEARS TO BE IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE INSTRUCTION IN THE 2008 DODGE OWNER'S MANUAL PAGE 334 UNDER NOTE:  TO SELECT THE PROPER GEAR POSITION FOR MAXIMUM DECELERATION (ENGINE BREAKING), SIMPLY PRESS AND HOLD THE GEAR SELECTOR LEVER TO THE LEFT (-). THE TRANSMISSION WILL SHIFT TO THE RANGE FROM WHICH THE VEHICLE CAN BEST BE SLOWED DOWN.   THIS IS CLEARLY NOT PROVIDING THE DESIRED RESULT.    TO ASSIST THE VEHICLE IN MAINTAINING CONTROL DOWNHILL, SHIFTING THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION INTO 3RD GEAR  (AT 60 KPH.) SHOULD ENABLE THE VEHICLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL WITHOUT HAVING TO 'RIDE THE BRAKES'. THIS IS NOT THE CASE; THE ELECTRONICS CONTROLLING THE SHIFTING SYSTEM IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION DROPS OUT OF LOW GEAR (3RD) INTO HIGH GEAR (D) UNDER THE SLIGHTEST DOWNHILL MOMENTUM, THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE.  PAGE 337 IN THE 208 DODGE OWNER'S MANUAL SPECIFICALLY WARNS THAT RIDING THE BRAKES CAN LEAD TO BRAKE FAILURE AND POSSIBLY AN ACCIDENT.    AS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED TO OUR HORROR ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS DRIVING ON THE WEST COAST (VANCOUVER ISLAND), WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN VEHICLE CONTROL ON A DOWNHILL STRETCH OF PAVED ROAD, THIS 4 SPEED ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING ANY ENGINE BRAKING ASSISTANCE WHATSOEVER.

(IF YOU ARE GOING TO FAST TO START WITH IT WON?T EVEN DOWN SHIFT). NOW I ASKED THE MECHANIC, WHAT HAPPENS IF I LOOSE MY BRAKES, THE ANSWER HE HAD WAS IT?S A DESIGN FEATURE, SO I CONCLUDED THAT IF I WOULD PUSH ON THE EMERGENCY BREAK, WHICH LOCKS, THAT WOULD PUT ME INTO AN UNCONTROLLED SLIDE WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED.     WHAT IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN A MOUNTAIN ROAD WHILE TOWING A TRAILER, YOU WOULD HAVE TO APPLY THE BREAKS TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION IN A LOWER GEAR. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR BREAKS FAIL, THAT?S RIGHT THE VAN SHIFT UP TO FREEWHEELING? LEAVING YOU TO DO WHAT, USE THE EMERGENCY BREAK WHICH LOCKS YOU INTO A SKID. BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PEDAL HAS TO BE PUSHED THE SECOND TIME TO UNLOCK.    NOW I ?AM SURE EVERYBODY CAN REMAIN CALM AND REMEMBER TO DO ALL THIS WHILE TOWING A TRAILER WITH YOUR WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN IN THE BACK OF THE VAN, SCREAMING WHAT IS THE MATTER? *TR",
