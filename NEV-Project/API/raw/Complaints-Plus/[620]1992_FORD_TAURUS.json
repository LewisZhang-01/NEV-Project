THE COST OF THE REPAIR WAS $426.70  IN JULY OF 1998, I (DANIEL ZEHLER - SON OF MARGARET) RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM FORD HAVING TO DO WITH A SIMILAR/IDENTICAL DEFECT ON 1993 TAURUS AND SABLE VEHICLES.  IT TURNS OUT THAT I OWN A 1993 TAURUS.  PER THE RECALL LETTER, THE SAFETY DEFECT IS AS FOLLOWS:  \"THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS ON YOUR VEHICLE CAN FRACTURE IF THE VEHICLE IS OPERATED IN HIGH-CORROSION AREAS OF NORTH AMERICA FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF THE FRACTURE ON THE SPRING THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRE CAN BE DAMAGED.  A FRACTURED SPRING CAN CAUSE ONE SIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE TO BE LOWER THAN THE OTHER, CAN RESULT IN CLUNKING OR RATTLING NOISE OR CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO RIDE ROUGHLY.\"  IN THE WHAT WILL FORD DO CATEGORY, THE LETTER STATES THAT FORD IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL WARRANTY COVERAGE FOR FRONT SPRING REPLACEMENT, REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2001.  IN THE WHAT SHOULD WE DO CATEGORY, THE LETTER STATES THAT \"IF EITHER OF THE VEHICLE'S FRONT SPRINGS SHOULD FRACTURE DURING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD, CONTACT YOUR DEALER.  AT NO COST TO YOU/US, THE DEALER WILL REPLACE BOTH FRONT COIL SPRINGS.\"  IN THE MEANTIME, SO AS TO PREVENT TIRE DAMAGE SHOULD THE SPRING FRACTURE, FORD HAS DEVELOPED A SPECIAL PLASTIC PROTECTIVE SHIELD, WHICH HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON OUR 1993 TAURUS.  AS THE 1992 & 1993 TAURUS MODELS ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE RECALL ON THE 1993 TAURUS'S SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE 1992'S AS OUR DEFECT SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL TO THAT WHICH FORD HAS ALREADY AGREEDEFECT ONTHE CAR WAS THEN TOWED TO THE.",

WE FOUND SMOKE CAME FROM UNDER THE HOOD ON JANUARY 21, AND HAD MY CAR CHECKED BY A MECHANIC. THE REPORTED PROBLEM WAS POWER STEERING LEAKING AND THEN THE RELATED PRESSURE AND RETURN HOSES WERE REPLACED. IT SEEMED OK. BUT ON JANUARY 26, MY CAR WAS SUDDENLY ON FIRE WHEN WE WERE DRIVING WITH OUR TEACHER. WE HAD TO CALL 911 TO SMOTHER THE FIRE. MANY WIRINGS WERE DAMAGED, THUS THE CAR CANNOT BE DRIVEN ANYMORE. AND LATER WE STILL FOUND THE POWER STEERING LEAKING. IN BOTH CASES, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DEMONSTRATED EVERYTHING WAS OK EVEN WHEN THREE PERSONS WERE ON FIRE!  IS THE AUTO SAFE?  COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO FIND AN AUTHORIZED OFFICE IN RENO, NV TO INSPECT THE CAUSE OF THE VEHICLE FIRE? THANK YOU.  *AK",
