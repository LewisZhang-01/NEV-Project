I have made the pictures of the stains. This stained snow smelled as a fuel. The fuel leak was pretty bad. When I looked under the car it was dripping about 1-2 drops per second. Also the leak was very close to the exhaust pipe (maybe 1-2 inches) that could be very hot and theoretically could ignite a fire. As soon as I discovered the leak, the car was taken to the nearest CHEVY dealer Highland GM in Aurora, ON, Canada. They diagnosed the issue and fixed it on February 1st.

I am now without a car again because of a third brake vacuum pump failure.  I have not been able to get any assistance from GM or my local Chevy dealership.  I now am faced with a bill for repair for almost $2000.  It is ridiculous to think that such a serious safety issue would exist and the industry will not acknowledge that it goes far beyond the vehicles they have already recalled.  I wonder how many more accidents will happen before this is corrected.  To be honest, when I do get my vehicle back I\u2019m not sure I will drive it.  When you lose your breaks 3 times it\u2019s very difficult to trust.  I would like to see this corrected and the Equinox needs to be added.

I have had these issues since. These issues have been occurring since around 16,000 miles and keep getting worst everyday. GM claim not to have a fix for these issues. They offered a few thousand to buy back the vehicle claiming drastic depreciation for milage and wear. At that time owed over $25,000 balance for the vehicle. No one stood to benefit but the lemon law attorneys.They did not consider the milage when these issues started and this is my only source of transportation to use which I told the lemon law attorneys. The lemon law attorneys were going to charge their fee from me if GM refused to pay their fees. I told them I felt in my best interest I should wait for GM's recall for this vehicle as I'm sure I wasn't the only consumer that was having these same issues.

VADEN SERVICE  PERSONNEL EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND 'FOUND NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY'.  4. IN MARCH, 2018, I OBTAINED A DECIBEL(DB) METER, FOR SOUND MEASUREMENT. WITH THIS METER, I WAS ABLE TO MEASURE SOUND EXPOSURE LEVEL(SEL) .  5. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, WHILE ON ANOTHER ROAD TRIP, AGAIN ON INTERSTATE 95, I WAS ABLE TO MEASURE THE NOISE LEVEL.  IT FLUCTUATED BETWEEN 81 AND 85 DECIBELS, 'A' SCALE (DBA). NIOSH  & OSHA WOULD RECOMMEND LIMITING THE 8 HOUR EXPOSURE TO LESS THAN 85 DBA. AND REQUIRE   6. WITH ANOTHER TRIP TO VADEN, THEY EXAMINED THE EQUINOX AGAIN USING A FREQUENCY METER.  MY EQUINOX WAS DRIVEN IN COMPARISON TO ANOTHER ANALOGOUS EQUINOX. VADEN INFORME THEM D ME THEY BOTH SOUNDED THE SAME AND THE FREQUENCY WAS QUITE SIMILAR. I WAS UNABLE TO CONVINCE THAT FREQUENCY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AMPLITUDE.  I WAS TOLD THAT IS THE WAY GENERAL MOTORS ENGINEERS DESIGNED THE VEHICLE.  7. LATER IN MARCH 2018,  I INSULATED THE VEHICLE DOORS, FRONT AND REAR FENDERS, AND BACK HATCH WITH SOUND PROOFING MATERIAL AT MY EXPENSE. THE DECIBEL RATING DECREASED TO 78-82 DECIBELS AT 60MPH ON THE INTERSTATE 95.  MY WIFE AND I HAD TO SHOUT AT EACH OTHER TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION.   8.

THE GAVE ME A RENTAL TO GET HOME (5 HRS SOUTH) HOWEVER, I AM STILL PAYING ON A UHAUL TRAILER RENTAL AS THE RENTAL VAN DID NOT HAVE TOWING CAPABILITIES.  TOW 1 WAS $250 AND TOW 2 WAS $125.  RENTAL IS $50 PER DAY.  PARTS/LABOR IS EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE OVER $2200 PLUS THE VAN RENTAL, PLUS THE UHAUL TRAILER EXTRA DAYS RENTAL, PLUS THE GAS TO GO BACK AND GET THE VEHICLE AND BRING IT HOME WITH THE UHAUL TRAILER.  DEALER WAS ADVISED BY ME TO LOOK AT THE VACUUM PUMP ON TUE A.M.  TUE P.M. DEALER CALLED BACK.  VERIFIED VACUUM PUMP ISSUE AND STATED IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND THAT IT DISINTEGRATED.  IT WAS ALSO SITTING ON THE FRONT DUAL OVERHEAD EXHAUST AND THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE CAMSHAFT EXHAUST.  BOTH OF THOSE BROKE AWAY AS WELL.  NEED TO REPLACE THOSE AND THE TIMING CHAIN WITH AN OIL CHANGE TO ENSURE NO METAL REMAINS IN THE ENGINE.  GM/CHEVY SHOULD BE FIXING THIS AT NO COST PLUS PAYING FOR THE TOWING CHARGES, EXTRA RENTALS, AND GAS.  NOT HAVING BRAKES IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND PUTTING MY LIFE, MY FAMILY'S LIFE AND THE LIFE OF PEOPLE ON THE ROAD AROUND US IS NOT WHAT I CONSIDER A GOOD PRODUCT.  PHOTOS FROM THE DEALER WILL BE ASKED FOR, ESPECIALLY THE VACUUM PUMP.  I WILL PROMPTLY FORWARD BILLS AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE.",

THIS HAS HAPPENED 5 TIMES SO FAR.  AFTER THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS ALSO A CHECK ENGINE CODE AND THE DEALER REPLACED A TRANSMISSION SENSOR.  SINCE THE 1ST TIME (WITH JUST OVER 100 MILES ON THE BRAND NEW CAR) IT HAPPENED 3 MORE TIMES WITHOUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND AFTER SHUTDOWN AND RESTARTED IT WOULD OPERATE NORMALLY.  THE 5TH TIME (2 DAYS AGO) IT HAPPENED AGAIN ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON, I WENT SLOWLY STRAIGHT 2 THE DEALER (1 MILE AWAY AT THE TIME).    IT IS STILL AT THE DEALER.  THIS HAS ALL BEEN ON CITY STREETS.  WHEN THIS OCCURS I TIED THE MANUAL FUNCTION ON THE SHIFTER AND IT STILL WOULDN'T SHIFT",

THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BECOME A MULTI CAR PILEUP WITH INJURIES AND OR FATALITIES. HAVING AN AUTOMOTIVE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING BUILDING MY FIRST CAR ENGINE AT AGE 15 YRS OLD IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS WAS A FAULTY RIM BASED ON IMPURITIES IN ITS CASTING PROCESS OR A POSSIBLE STRESS CRACK.
