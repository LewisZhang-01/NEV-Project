        "summary": "Brakes-- I was not having any brake issues at all before this happened:  I started braking while  pulling into a hotel parking lot but the brake petal went right down to the floor and I had no brakes!  I put the car in neutral and pushed down on the emergency brake.  I went up a curb but at least didn't hit the building.  I had the car towed, explained what happened, and the auto repair shop couldn't find anything wrong with the braking system??  And then, of course, it happened again.  I had a different place look at the braking system and I think it was a master cyclinder problem.    Electrical- the car has turned off completely while driving, even on the highway.  I have to put it in neutral and restart it.  Cam shaft sensor is being replaced next week and hopefully that will fix the issue.",
