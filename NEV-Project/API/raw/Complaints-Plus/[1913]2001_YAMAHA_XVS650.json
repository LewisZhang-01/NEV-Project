ON ANY HOWL PROBLEM!!  LATER, ON THE YAMAHA V-STAR FORUM,  I LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A BATCH OF 5TH GEARS FOR THE TRANSMISSION, THAT WERE NOT HEAT TREATED CORRECTLY. AS THE GEARS GOT OLDER... THE HOWL BEGAN.  MANY FOLKS WERE FORCED TO HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE MFG. DEFECT!!!  AFTER THE DEFECT WAS UNCOVERED...  YAMAHA STILL WOULD ONLY PAY FOR THE \"PARTS\" !! PARTS ARE WORTH MAYBE $100...  COMPARED TO THE TOTAL BILL OF $1,500 OR MORE. I ALSO HAD TO HAVE MY TRANSMISSION REBUILT,  SO PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR LIST OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM.  THE SAD PART IS THAT YAMAHA STILL REFUSES TO ADMIT ANYTHING!!!  MANY PEOPLE ARE PAYING LARGE REPAIR BILLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER.  WAYNE CORNELL.  *JB",
