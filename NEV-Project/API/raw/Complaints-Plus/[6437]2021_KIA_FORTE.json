I called Camelback to confirm if that was what they should be kept at - left a message. After 3 failed attempts getting a call back from Camelback and 3 contacts with KIA via their website (no return contacts).

When I was leaving the parking lot, again pressing the accelerator produced a complete loss of power. Letting off the accelerator and easing it back down produced normal operation.  This scared me as there were pedestrians present and I was not sure how much control I had on speed.  While I was driving home on I-580 at freeway speed, I tried to change lanes. As I tried to accelerate, I experienced a complete loss of power. I had to swerve back into my lane and let off the gas and ease it back down to produce normal operation.  Total miles to date: 140.  Not driving car now.",
