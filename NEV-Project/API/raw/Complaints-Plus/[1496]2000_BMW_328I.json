Took to BMW dealer and they informed me that there was a recall and they'd look into it. Days later picked up my car and they said they went off from aftermarket items on my car. Which is absurdly inaccurate. I'm an auto mechanic of 10 years and nothing I've done to my car has any effect on the airbag or safety systems of my car period. They were extremely rude, didn't want to fix the over $5000 of damage that was done to my interior. Treated me like I was some idiot. And didn't offer me a loaner vehicle for the 3 days they had my car either like they guarantee they do in the event of recalls.",

HE SAID THAT THE VEHICLE IS TOTALLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE BEEN WITH TRYING TO REPAIR IT BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DEFECT. I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY, USAA, EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND FILED A CLAIM. THEIR ADJUSTER LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND REPORTED THAT IT IS A TOTAL LOSS AND IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. HOWEVER, THE ADJUSTER SAID USAA WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING ON THE CLAIM BECAUSE IT IS A PRE-EXISTING MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT BMW SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. I CONTACTED BMW AND FOUND THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THE MANUFACTURING SUBFRAME DEFECT RENDERING THE VEHICLES UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND WORTHLESS. BMW PAID FOR REPAIRS TO RE-WELD THE SUBFRAME BUT QUIT PAYING IN 2006. BMW ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURING OF MY CAR, SO NOW I HAVE A CAR THAT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS AND CAN ONLY BE SOLD FOR PARTS. BMW'S REFUSAL TO RECALL AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MODEL YEARS FOR WHICH IT MANUFACTURED DEFECTIVE SUBFRAMES, THEREBY CREATING A SAFETY HAZARD THAT COULD END IN DEATH FOR THE CAR'S OCCUPANTS, IS INEXCUSABLE. BMW SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND BE REQUIRED TO RECALL ALL OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES AND REIMBURSE ALL PERSONS LIKE MYSELF FOR MANUFACTURING A DEFECTIVE CAR THAT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD AND CAUSES THE VEHICLES TO BECOME WORTHLESS ONCE A TEAR OCCURS IN THE SUBFRAME.   *TR",

SINCE THEN, THE CAR EITHER HESITATES TO REVERSE OR COMPLETELY FAILS TO GO IN REVERSE ABOUT HALF THE TIME I DRIVE IT.  MY MECHANIC INFORMS ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.

        "summary": "CRASH - NO INJURIES.   XENON HEADLIGHTS OF A 328I 2000 BMW.   LOW FLAT BEAM NOTED TO BE A PROBLEM - I CAME UP UPON FOUR VERTICAL STICKS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROAD, A RURAL 2 LANE COUNTRY ROAD, ON A DARK NIGHT.  WHEN I WAS APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET FROM THEM, THE LIGHT REFLECTING FROM THE ROAD, ILLUMINATED THE UNDERSIDE OF A DEER.  LUCKILY I HAD SLOWED ENOUGH THAT I WAS ABLE TO STOP IN TIME.  I ASKED THE BMW DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ,AND WAS TOLD THAT THE LIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE RAISED BECAUSE THE XENON LIGHTS WOULD BLIND ONCOMING DRIVERS, AND THEY WERE AT THE CORRECT HEIGHT.  ONE YEAR LATER, MY SON WAS DRIVING ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET, AND HIT A PARKED PICKUP TRUCK.  CONDITIONS - NIGHT, RECENT SNOW PLOWED STREETS CAUSED THE PICKUP TO PARK A FOOT AND A HALF FROM THE CURB.  THE TRUCK WAS A DARK GREEN FOUR WHEEL DRIVE, FARM PICKUP (HIGH BUMPER)(MID BUMPER MEASURES 27\" OFF PAVEMENT).  MY DAUGHTER WAS A PASSENGER IN THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT.  NEITHER SEEN THE PICKUP UNTIL THE LAST SECOND.  MY DAUGHTER SPOTTED IT FIRST AND SCREAMED. MY SON LOOKED OVER AT HER AND LOOKED BACK JUST AS THEY HIT IT.  I DO NOT BELIEVE HE EVEN HIT THE BRAKES. HOWEVER, HE STARTED TO SWERVE TO THE LEFT.  THE BUMPER OF THE CAR WENT UNDER THE BUMPER OF THE TRUCK , HITTING ONLY THE TRUCK'S SPARE TIRE AND DRIVER SIDE REAR WHEEL. THE TRUCK'S BUMPER DID HIT THE RADIATOR AND VALVE COVER OF THE ENGINE.  THE BMW WAS TOTALED - THE RIGHT SHOCK TOWER WAS MOVED BACK BY ABOUT 5 INCHES. THE AIRBAGS NEVER WENT OFF - DEALERSHIP STATES THAT IS BECAUSE, \"THE BUMPERS DID NOT HIT\".  THE TRUCK HAD MINIMAL DAMAGE - BENT BUMPER, TRUCK BED WAS ELEVATED AND DID DENT THE BACK OF THE CAB/DRIVERS SIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE XENON LIGHTS PROBABLY DID NOT ILLUMINATE THE PARKED TRUCK ADEQUATELY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SHINE HIGH ENOUGH.    HAS THIS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR OTHER DRIVERS OF BMWS AND MERCEDES.*AK",

THIS CONSTANT LOADING AND UNLOADING WEAKENS THE SHEET METAL AND CAUSES IT TO FATIGUE AND SEPARATE FROM THE CHASSIS. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN MANY FAILURES OF THE CHASSIS ON LOW MILEAGE STREET CARS..\"    THAT IS A QUOTE FROM THE RESPECTED BMW SPECIALISTS AT TURNER MOTORSPORT (WWW.TURNERMOTORSPORT.COM).   THAT IS THE EXACT PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD.  BMWAG (GERMANY) RECOGNIZED THIS ISSUE AND HAS ADDRESSED IT...  BMWNA (NORTH AMERICA) HAS BLOWN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF US OFF... STATING THAT WE ARE POST WARRANTY AND THAT IT'S DUE TO ROAD HAZARDS OR JUST WEAR AND TEAR.  THE FRAME, SUBFRAME, AND IT'S MOUNTING POINTS SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR, WITHOUT QUESTION.  I'VE ALREADY GOT A LAWYER WHICH WILL BE PERUSING THIS - AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BMW UNTIL THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE  AND ISSUE A RECALL ON ALL E46 BMWS.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSAFE - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DRIVER SIDE REAR SUSPENSION / FRAME COLLAPSES ON A WINDY ROAD OR ON THE HIGHWAY?  IT WILL ABSOLUTELY LOSE CONTROL AND MOST LIKELY HEAD LEFT - TOWARDS ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I HAVE NO OTHER VEHICLE WHICH I CAN DRIVE AND THE CONDITION IS ONLY GETTING WORSE ... LOUDER ... MORE ANNOYING.  PLEASE HELP.  THERE ARE MUCH MORE OF US THAT HAVE THIS ISSUE... PLEASE REFER TO THE LINKS BELOW.  I'M NOT TRYING TO GET OVER ON ANYONE - I JUST KNOW THAT BMW NEEDS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE ...
