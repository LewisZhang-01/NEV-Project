WHEN I INQUIRED TO THE COMPANY I BOUGHT THE CAMPER AT, THEIR SERVICE MANAGER SAID I COULD BRING THE CAMPER OVER, BUT HE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYONE RECEIVE WARRANTY ON TIRES.  AFTER A CLOSER LOOK AT MY TIRES I SEEN THAT THE DOT DATE SAID THE TIRES WHERE MADE IN THE 31ST WEEK OF 2008.  MY COMPLAINT IS NOT ONLY PERSONAL, BUT WONDER HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PURCHASED A NEW RV ONLY TO FIND THAT THE TIRES ARE 2 YEARS OLD OR OLDER. *TR",
