They tell me I have to take my car in first, then they will inspect it and order the part (AutoNation Honda Sanford 407-323-6100). I arrived early, they took my car in and in about an hour later they called me that my car was ready. I was surprised on how fast the job was done. I looked at the invoice paperwork Honda gave me and left home. At my house I was looking at the invoice and it did not show anywhere where the airbag was recalled, so there was NO second appointment. I called on the same day of my appointment (Nov. 14, 2020) and speak to a rep who I explained the situation. She placed me on hold a few times and at one point I asked to speak to the person who was in charge who was Michael Donaldson (service advisor 7927). I explained to the service manager that I did not see anything about the airbag being recalled. He said after the tests they performed, my car did not need the airbag to be replaced, so they did not schedule another appointment because of that. Mr. Donaldson did tell me that Honda performed a SOFTWARE update and that would be it. I asked Mr. Donaldson \"how a software update is going to fix the metal pieces inside the airbag?\" His replied was \"that was all the car needed\". I decided not to call the same Honda dealer again, but did call Holler Honda (407) 629-1234. Unfortunately before I was able to take my car in, the transmission failed, so I had to cancel. I WILL fix the transmission and the car WILL be on the road again. I have proof of what Honda in Sanford did on the day of my appointment. I keep receiving letters and emails about the recall, so something WAS NOT done correctly, because if they send the report that my car didn't need an airbag, why do I keep getting letters and emails to call for appointment? I ALREADY MADE AN APPOINTMENT and HONDA DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.",

I CONTACTED HONDA WITH NO ASSISTANCE AS THEY SAID THERE IS A 10 YEAR WARRANTY ON THIS RECALL. YESTERDAY I STARTED BY GETTING ASSISTANCE FROM EMILY, BRIANA, NICOLE AND ALEXIS AT HONDA - CASE NO. N012015-05-2002159 AND TO EXPECT A CALL FROM HONDA. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON JAMES (NO ID OR LAST NAME) REGIONAL CASE MANAGER. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE COULD NOT ASSIST ME.  1. I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER. 2.  I AM NOT A LOYAL HONDA OWNER AS I HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANOTHER HONDA. 3. NO REPAIRS THROUGH HONDA. 4. THE CAR IS OVER 10 YEARS OLD. I INFORMED HIM TO CHECK ANOTHER RECALL WHICH SUPERCEDES THE PREVIOUS RECALL AND DATED 3/14/2006.  HE INFORMED ME TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE AT MY EXPENSE AT HONDA AND THE CASE IS CLOSED. I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS A FAULT WITH HONDA AND IT IS NOT 10 YEARS SINCE THE RECALL AND I FEAR DRIVING MY ONLY CAR WITH AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT -  SEAT BELTS AND  AIRBAGS AND AN ENORMOUS DANGER TO ME AND MY GRANDCHILDREN. HE INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT HIS OR HONDA'S RESPONSIBILITY.  PLEASE HELP ME. I NEED HONDA TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.",

I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE DELAYED GEAR ENGAGEMENT, BOTH ON  UP SHIFTS AND DOWNSHIFTS AS WELL AS TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAKAGE WHICH WAS INITIALLY DIAGNOSED AS A BAD LEFT SIDE AXLE SEAL. WHEN THE MECHANIC PROCEEDED TO FIX THE AXLE SEAL, HE THEN RE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS BAD BEARINGS AND A FAULTY TRANSMISSION, A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 & 2001 ACCORDS. SINCE THEN I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO SEVERAL OTHER MECHANICS AND TRANSMISSION SPECIALISTS FOR A SECOND OPINION, WHO HAVE REACHED THE VERY SAME CONCLUSION/DIAGNOSIS.    A VAST MAJORITY OF THE TRANSMISSIONS ON THE 2000 AND 2001 ACCORDS HAVE FAILED OR ARE HAVING PROBLEMS. THE SCARY PART IS ALL THE TRANSMISSION SHOPS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE, SOME OF THEM SEE AN ACCORD OR AN ODYSSEY (SIMILAR PROBLEM) ONCE A WEEK! FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE/INVESTIGATION THE COMMON CONSENSUS IS; THE HONDA TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE LATE 90'S WERE BULLETPROOF BECAUSE THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY BUILT FOR THE CARS FROM THE 90'S. HOWEVER, WHEN HONDA UPGRADED THE SIZE OF THEIR ENGINES AND POWER, HONDA USED THE SAME 90'S TRANSMISSIONS, WHICH IN THE LONG RUN COULD NO LONGER HANDLE THE  LARGER ENGINE CAPACITY OR THE EXTRA POWER AND EVENTUALLY FAIL.    IN 2006 HONDA WAS HIT WITH A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS. HONDA SETTLED THE MATTER OUT OF COURT BY EXTENDING THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY TO 93 MONTHS OR 109,000 MILES. HOWEVER, HONDA NEVER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM BY REDESIGNING THE TRANSMISSIONS OR PROVIDED A FIX. INSTEAD, HONDA SIMPLY REPLACED THE OLD FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS WITH NEW TRANSMISSIONS THAT STILL HAD THE SAME FAULTY DESIGN. NOW, ALL THE TRANSMISSION IN THOSE CARS ARE FAILING AS WELL AND HONDA DENIES ANY RESPONSIBILITY, CLAIMING THE TRANSMISSIONS ARE OUT OF WARRANTY.   *TR",

CHECKED ONLINE AND IT SEEMS TO BE A WIDELY PREVALENT ISSUE WITH GEN 6 ACCORDS (98 - 02).

HONDA CHANGED THE LOCATION OF THE A/C DRAIN IN 2003 (WITH THEIR 7TH GEN ACCORDS), AND THIS PROBLEM IS NOT AN ISSUE ON THOSE CARS. HONDA HAS SAID THAT IT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE, BUT THEY ARE BETTER OFF PUTTING OUT A RECALL AND COVERING THE COST OF REPLACING THESE FRONT PASSENGER SUBFRAMES THAN HAVING TO PAY FOR A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ONCE SOMEBODY IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF A ROTTING SUBFRAME.

WHEN I ADDRESSED MY CONCERN TO THE DALTON AGENCY, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER, MANUEL PEZ NAVARRO AND THE HEAD OF MECHANICS, JORGE CARDENAS ONLY DO OIL CHANGE AND FILTERS.  THEY ADVISED IF I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE AIR BAGS DID NOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY, THAT I SHOULD PAY A TECHNICIAN $600.00 PESOS TO CONNECT A SCANNER TO MY CAR TO SEE IF THERE IS AN ERROR IN THE SYSTEM, AN ERROR THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THERE FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN THE CAR WAS ASSEMBLED.

WHEN I ASKED HONDA ABOUT IT THIS WEEK, THEY TOLD ME MY CAR WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL CLASS. AND THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY COULD DETERMINE THIS BY MY CAR'S VIN -- THAT THE VIN INDICATED IT WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL CLASS.

BASED ON MY REVIEW OF YOUR \"2004 ANNUAL SUMMARY OF EMISSION RELATED RECALL\" (HTTP://WWW.EPA.GOV/OTAQ/CERT/RECALL/420B05022.PDF), IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS PART OF THE CLASS.

I AM REALLY SHOCKED TO SEE THIS KIND OF UNINTENDED/SUDDEN ACCELERATION HAPPEN WITH HONDA ACCORD CARS WHICH COULD PROVE TO BE FATAL FOR THE DRIVER, PASSENGER AND PEDESTRIAN ALIKE.  *TR",

I HAVE THE NOTICE FROM HONDA DATED SPRING 2006 ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HOW THEY ARE COVERING THIS PROBLEM FOR 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES. I CALLED HONDA IN CA AT 800-999-1009 ON 8/23/12 AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR BECAUSE THE CAR IS OVER 10 YEARS FROM ITS JUNE 2000 BUILT DATE. THE CAR HAD 130100 MILES ON THE DAY I CALLED. FUNNY THING IS THAT THEY WILL COVER ANY SEAT BELT PROBLEM FOR THE LIFE OF THE CAR REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF OWNERS BUT THEY WON'T COVER THE SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM, I CALLED MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN NOW, WHICH I DID. THEY SCANNED THE SRS SYSTEM FOR A CODE. CAME UP THE OCCUPANT POSITION DETECTION SYSTEM ( OPDS).  I ASKED IF THE AIR BAGS WOULD STILL DEPLOY IN A CRASH WITH THE SRS LIGHT ON AND HE SAID NO. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE AIR BAGS WILL WORK AND I FEEL HONDA SHOULD REPAIR THIS DEFECT FOR FREE SINCE IT IS A LIFE SAVING SAFETY SYSTEM. I CALLED HONDA AGAIN  AFTER I GOT HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO TRY TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE HIGHER UP IN MANAGEMENT CHAIN AND AS USUAL I GOT NOWHERE.    THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR AND IT'S DEALER ONLY PARTS. THERE SEEMS TO BE MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN I SEARCHED \"2000 ACCORD SRS ON\" AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE WITH THIS LIGHT ON SAID THAT THEY ARE OR DID NOT GET IT FIXED DUE TO THE HIGH QUOTED COST OF THE REPAIR. THESE CARS ARE ON THE ROAD WITH NON-WORKING SRS/ AIRBAGS SYSTEMS BECAUSE HONDA USED SUBSTANDARD PARTS THAT DID NOT LAST AS LONG AS THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THAN REFUSES TO PROPERLY FIX THIS PROBLEM,THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT!    I WISH THE NHTSA  WOULD ORDER HONDA TO RECALL AND REPAIR THESE CARS REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE OR TIME AT NO CHARGE.  ALOT OF THESE OLDER HONDA ACCORDS WILL END UP BEING PURCHASED USED BY THE YOUNGER DRIVERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD A BRAND NEW CAR.  *TR",

ON JUNE 12, 2005 ABOUT AN SRS RELATED PROBLEM RELATING TO THEIR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 06-009 DATED FEBRUARY 5, 2008. I WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY HAS ALREADY EXPIRED BECAUSE  THE VEHICLE IS MORE THAN 10 YEARS OLD EVEN IF THE MILEAGE IS LESS THAN 124,000 MILES. I AM THE SECOND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED FROM A PRIVATE PARTY BACK IN 2004. SINCE THESE MODELS CAME WITHOUT AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT, I HAD ONE INSTALLED THE SAME YEAR (2004) AT THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP NEAR OUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE. BECAUSE OF THIS SERVICE, THEY SHOULD HAVE UPDATED THE OWNERSHIP RECORD FOR THIS VEHICLE TO REFLECT MY NAME AS THE NEW OWNER. WHEN THIS BULLETIN CAME OUT, HONDA FAILED TO FURNISH ME A COPY OF THE TSB SINCE I ONLY FOUND OUT FROM THEM ON JUNE 25, 2012 THAT THE SAID VEHICLE WAS STILL REGISTERED WITH THE FIRST OWNER. WHEN THE PROBLEM ABOUT THE SRS UNIT OCCURRED WHICH WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BULLETIN THEY RELEASED ON FEBRUARY 5, 2008 THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE BULLETIN ANYMORE AND EVEN TOLD ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED, EVEN IF THE BULLETIN SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THE VEHICLES AFFECTED INCLUDED \"2000-2001 HONDA ACCORD 2-DR AND 4-DR: ALL WITH OPDS\". I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP LAST FRIDAY, 6/22/2012 WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THIS TSB EVER EXISTED AND THEY WERE CHARGING ME A SUBSTANTIAL FEE TO GET IT FIXED EVEN THOUGH IT IS A FACTORY DEFECT AND SHOULD BE FIXED BY THEM WITHOUT COST TO ME. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THEY FAILED TO FURNISH ME A COPY OF THE SERVICE BULLETIN AND NOW THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED TO MY VEHICLE THEY WILL NOT HONOR THAT SERVICE BULLETIN.

ALSO, I INVESTIGATED HOW TOYOTA BRAKES OF SIMILAR CAR SIZE NEVER GOT SO HOT AND FOUND ONE CONSTRUCTION ELEMENT THAT DIFFERENT BETWEEN HONDA ACCORD 2000 BRAKES AND TOYOTA CAMRY BRAKES. TOYOTA BRAKES USE V SHAPE RETURN SPRINGS ON A BRAKE PADS AND BRAKE PADS HAVE HOLES IN THEM TO ACCEPT END POINTS OF THESE V SPRINGS.  I DRILLED HOLES IN HONDA BRAKE PADS USING TOYOTA CAMRY BRAKE PADS AS A REFERENCE. ALSO, BENT V SHAPE RETURN SPRINGS FROM PIANO STRING 1.2 MM (BOUGHT IN ACE HARDWARE) AND INSTALLED THE SAME WAY AS ON TOYOTA. ROTORS  HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT 40K MILES.

THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN RESURFACING YOUR ROTORS! USE TOYOTA CAMRY BRAKE PADS AND V SPRINGS AS REFERENCE OR JUST BUY V SPRINGS DESIGNED FOR CAMRY (BRAKE REPAIR KIT).

THE DRIVER STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AND TRIED TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL BUT THE VEHICLE WENT INTO DRIVE AND LURCHED FORWARD AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED UNCONTROLLABLY ACROSS THE SIDEWALK, THREE(3) LANES OF TRAFFIC, THROUGH A LAWN WHERE IT FIRST STRUCK A BRICK BUILDING, REMOVED A 30-INCH LANDSCAPE BOULDER, AND THEN STRUCK A SECOND BUILDING WHICH STOPPED IT,  TRAVELING OVER 200 FEET  BEFORE COMING TO A HALT IN A PUBLIC ALLEY. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN ONLY A FEW SECONDS AND THE DRIVER COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE BRAKES DID NOT HELP. IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT THE DRIVER WAS NOT HIT OR KILLED GOING ACROSS THE HIGHWAY.

THE FAILURE, HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS, IT'S CONSEQUENCES:  ON 8/3/10, STARTED TO DRIVE TO WORK.  AFTER 2 MILES, I CAME TO A STOP LIGHT.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I ACCELERATED.

FAILURE OF SDS AIRBAG SYSTEM ON HONDA ACCORDS AND OTHER HONDA VEHICLE MODELS IS AN ON-GOING CHRONIC PROBLEM THAT RENDERS THE ENTIRE AIRBAG SYSTEM INACTIVE UPON ANY COMPONENT FAILURE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD TO OWNERS AND DUE TO THE HIGH COST TO REPAIR THE SDS SYSTEM MANY OWNERS CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE THE SDS AIRBAG SYSTEM OPERATIVE AGAIN.  HONDA MUST STEP UP TO INSURING THAT LIFETIME WARRANTIES ON THE SDS SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE FOR ALL OWNERS AS AN SDS FAILURE MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH FOR THE VEHICLE OWNERS.  WAY TOO MANY SDS SYSTEM FAILURES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED BY HONDA DEALERS AND OWNERS.

THE CAR DROVE PERFECTLY FOR ABOUT 30 DAYS THEN THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO SLIP WHILE I WAS DRIVING. NOW THE TRANSMISSION JERKS INTO EVERY GEAR AS IT SHIFTS AND SLIPS OUT OF GEAR FREQUENTLY WHILE I AM DRIVING.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE ALL STORES ARE INFORMING ME THE PROBLEM WILL RETURN SOON WITH THIS SPECIFIC TRANSMISSION. I HAVE DONE SEVERAL INTERNET SEARCHES TO FIND I AM NOT THEE ONLY HONDA OWNER WITH THIS ISSUE AND I AM WRITING TO INFORM YOU OF MY CONCERNS WITH THIS VEHICLE ALSO. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED WITH 68K MILES OR SO AND IS NOW AROUND 80K FOR MILES. THIS ARE NOT NORMAL AREAS OF MILEAGE WHERE A TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE FAILING. I FEEL THIS UNSAFE AND CHRONIC PROBLEM SHOULD BE FIXED BY HONDA, EITHER BY A FACTORY RECALL (100% PAID FOR BY HONDA) OR A TOTAL BUY BACK OF THIS VEHICLE SINCE THEY HAVE SO BLATANTLY AND PURPOSELY SOLD DEFECTIVE AND UNSAFE VEHICLES PLACING NOT ONLY MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS BUT ALL DRIVERS ON THE ROAD IN DANGER.

AMERICAN HONDA SAID THAT I HAD TO BRING MY CAR INTO A DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE IT. (FYI - I'D ALREADY SPENT OVER $660 AT ANOTHER REPUTABLE SHOP TO HAVE THE PROBLEM REPAIRED WITHOUT RESOLUTION...BUT, THEY DID SAY THAT GIVEN ALL THE WORK THEY'D DONE, IT COULD ONLY BE THE TRANSMISSION).  IRONICALLY, DURING THE CALL THE REP COULD HEAR THAT THE CAR WAS REVVING AT HIGH RPMS BUT WOULDN'T SHIFT INTO D4. FEARFUL OF A FIRE OR BLOWN TRANSMISSION, I HAD TO PULL OVER, TURN OFF THE ENGINE, AND RESTART AFTER 5 MINUTES.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT IT WOULD STILL BE A MANDATORY $89 CHARGE TO DIAGNOSE SOMETHING BOTH THEY AND I ALREADY KNOW.  THE VOLUNTARY EXTENSION OF THE WARRANTY FROM 100K TO 109K IS RIDICULOUS.  I SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A VERY LARGE CONTINGENT OF HONDA OWNERS WHO HAVE, ALREADY HAD, OR WILL SOON HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

I TOO WAS METICULOUS ABOUT MAINTAINING MY VEHICLE EVERY 3 MONTH AT THE DEALER.  FIRST I EXPERIENCED A TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  THEY \"REPLACED\" IT UNDER THE RECALL...WITHIN 3 WEEKS THE \"REPLACED\" TRANSMISSION FAILED.  THEY \"REPLACED\" IT AGAIN; I THEN FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS \"REPLACED\" WITH A \"REBUILT\" TRANSMISSION AND NOT A NEW ONE.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I EXPERIENCE ALL KINDS OF \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT CODES.  IT WAS NEVER ENDING FOR 6 MONTHS...OF COURSE EVERYTHING WAS MY FAULT.  THE DEALER INSISTED THAT I REPLACED MY OWN RADIATOR FLUID AND THAT MY RADIATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  TRUST ME, I AM NOT MECHANICAL WHATSOEVER.  IT WAS ALWAYS SERVICED BY THE DEALER...FINALLY I GOT CALIFORNIA INVOLVED AND AFTER ALOT OF HUBABALOO IT WAS DECIDED THAT I MIGHT NOT NEED A RADIATOR AFTER ALL AFTER AN EXPERIENCED TECH CAME OUT TO \"LOOK AT THE ENGINE AND COOLING SYSTEM\".  LONG STORY SHORT, CALIFORNIA CALLED ME AND TOLD ME THAT MY RADIATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THEY WERE CERTAIN THAT THE ENGINE ISSUES WOULD GO AWAY.  THIS WAS ALL AT 70,000 MILES.  THIS CAR WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW FROM THE VERY SAME DEALER.  I FIND IT IRONIC THAT OTHER FOLKS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND ARE BEING JERKED AROUND IN THE SAME MANNER.  I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF AN AUTISTIC CHILD LIVING IN THE NE; I COULD NOT AFFORD THE CAR FAILING ME ON A COLD WINTER DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE.  I TRADED IT IN AND PURCHASED ANOTHER VEHICLE. I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH HONDA'S FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY LIFETIME!  *TR",

DURING ITS REGULAR MAINTENANCE SERVICE, I TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA SANTA ANA, CA AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS SITUATION.  THE SRS LIGHT WAS RESET ONLY TO FIND OUT AFTER 3 DAYS THAT IT CAME BACK ON.  ON JANUARY 2008 AND MARCH 2008, THE SAME SITUATION WAS HANDLED BY SANTA ANA HONDA AND AFTER 6-10 DAYS, THE LIGHT TURNED ON AGAIN AND AGAIN.  I WAS FINALLY INFORMED THAT THE CONTROL PANEL TO THE SRS UNIT WAS DEFECTIVE.  BECAUSE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED LONG AFTER THIS PROBLEM PERSISTED, THE SERVICE ADVISOR INDICATED THAT IF SANTA ANA HONDA WERE TO FIX THE EQUIPMENT, IT WOULD COST ME AT LEAST $1,600 WHICH WAS REDUCED BY 30% BY ITS SERVICE MANAGER JOHN MARKER.  IT WAS THEN THAT I BROUGHT UP THE CASE TO AMERICAN NORTH HONDA MOTOR CO INC AND WAS HANDLED BY WAYNE AT 1(800) 999-1009 EXT. 118198.  WAYNE CALLED  AND INFORMED ME THAT THEY ARE PARTICIPATING TO THIS REPAIR BY REDUCING THE COST BY $300.  IT DIDN'T MAKE LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THAT THE CONSUMER IS LIABLE FOR COSTS INVOLVED IN FIXING A SAFETY-RELATED DEVICE THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE.  THE FACT THAT BOTH SANTA ANA HONDA AND NORTH AMERICAN HONDA ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTING TO THE COSTS OF THIS REPAIR, TELLS ME THAT THIS IS A DEFECT OF THE VEHICLE.  MY FAMILY'S 1999 TOYOTA CAMRY AND FRIENDS' 2000 TOYOTA COROLLA NEVER HAD THEIR SRS WORN OUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME, WHY WOULD HONDA HAVE THIS PROBLEM?  PLEASE ASSIST ME CONTACT HONDA TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF THIS COSTS OR EXTEND THE WARRANTY.  MY CURRENT MILEAGE IS NOW 120,000.   *TR",

I WROTE HONDA TO SEE IF THEY HAD MORE INFORMATION ON THE TYPE OF PROBLEMS THAT COULD HAPPEN FROM THIS FAULTY TRANSMISSION AND  AFTER REACHING THE HIGHEST LEVEL PERSON I COULD GET, HE TOLD ME HE HAD NO INFORMATION.  AFTER ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY THING HONDA COULD DO, REALIZING THAT THEY HAVE MOVED THERE WARRANTY FROM 30,000 MILES TO 110,000 MILES TO COVER THIS PROBLEM, HE AGAIN STATED HE HAD NO INFORMATION.  THE HONDA REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT KNOW IF THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION COULD LEAD TO A HAZARD OR NOT.  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE YOU PURCHASE A VEHICLE THAT CONCERNS ARE NOT TYPICALLY COVERED, BUT THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED SAFETY HAZARD.  DUE TO HONDA'S FAULTY CONSTRUCTION, MANY TRANSMISSIONS WERE REPLACED OR NEED REPLACED AT THE OWNERS COST.  I WAS WONDERING WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL DUE TO THE SAFETY HAZARDS RELATED TO A FAULTY TRANSMISSION (HESITATION WITH PRESSING GAS PEDAL, AND DECREASE OF USE IN 1ST AND 2ND GEAR).  BY EXTENDING THE WARRANTY, I BELIEVE HONDA RECOGNIZES THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT  LEAVE MANY INDIVIDUALS TO FIND THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS.  I HAVE OWNED HONDA'S FOR YEARS AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT MY LAST.

FORTUNATELY I WAS ON THE FAR RIGHT LANE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS WITH ALL THE TRAFFIC. I WONDER IF ANY ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY HARMONIC BALANCER COMING LOOSE AND LOOSING ALL POWER?  BOTH FAN BELTS WERE OFF. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION BY THE HI WAY RESCUE TEAM, HE NOTICED THAT THE HARMONIC BALANCER WAS NOT INLINE.  I CALLED TACOMA HONDA THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE HARMONIC BALANCER COMING LOOSE ON HONDA ENGINES AND THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE HASN'T HEARD ANY PROBLEMS. SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A MECHANIC FRIEND OF MINE, VIN, AND HE REPAIRED. VIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WORKED ON ONE WHO HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN ABOUT THE SAME DAY ON A 1999 HONDA WITH LESS MILES. ALSO HIS FRIEND HAD A HARMONIC BALANCE COME LOOSE ON A PRELUDE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YEAR THIS CAR WAS MADE. THIS CANNOT BE JUST A TACOMA, WASHINGTON PROBLEM.  I ASKED THE PARTS MANAGER ABOUT HARMONIC BALANCERS COMING LOOSE AND HE SAID HE HAS HEARD OF IT.  A HARMONIC BALANCER SHOULD NEVER COME LOOSE FOR 2 REASONS. ONE, IT IS TIGHTEN SO TIGHT THAT YOU CAN NOT LOOSEN IT WITH A IMPACT WRENCH. TWO, IT TURN AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE THREAD.  THIS IS WHAT CARLA TOLD ME THIS MORNING THAT SHE IS NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO WHAT I EXPERIENCED.   I WILL WAIT FOR A WEEK FOR ANY FEEDBACK FROM YOU. IF YOUR RESEARCH FINDS NO PROBLEMS WITH HARMONIC BALANCER COMING LOOSE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MANY HARMONIC BALANCERS HAS BEEN SOLD OR REPLACED.

I HAD THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED IN JUNE 2005, AND WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF GETTING THE CAR BACK, THE SRS LIGHT CAME ON.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID I SHOULD BRING THE CAR IN RIGHT AWAY.  I PAID $68 TO HAVE THE SYSTEM \"TESTED\" AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR THE AIR BAGS AT A COST OF $575, OR I COULD HAVE THEM RESET IT AND IT MAY OR MAY NOT COME BACK ON.  I ASKED WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LIGHT WAS ON AND WAS TOLD THAT THE AIRBAGS JUST WON'T WORK.  I OPTED FOR THE RESET.  NOW, 2 WEEKS LATER, THE LIGHT IS BACK ON.  I HAVE DONE SOME INTERNET RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS A KNOWN PROBLEM, BUT THE \"CURES\" THAT ARE SUGGESTED BY THE DEALER ARE ALL OVER THE MAP.  I FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT HONDA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEFECT IN A MANDATED SAFETY DEVICE.  MY FAMILY WILL HOLD HONDA RESPONSIBLE IF I AM INJURED OR KILLED DUE TO A NON-INFLATING AIRBAG.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS TAKING THE AIRBAG ISSUE SERIOUSLY.  MY DAUGHTER WAS THANKFULLY NOT KILLED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT LAST JUNE IN HER CIVIC, WHOSE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY WHEN SHE WAS HIT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT TORE THE FRONT ENGINE HOUSING OFF HER CAR AND RESULTED IN A TOTAL LOSS.  THE HONDA FOLKS TOLD US THEN THAT SOMETIMES THE CAR ISN'T \"HIT THE RIGHT WAY\" AND THE SENSORS DON'T REGISTER THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD DEPLOY.

BEFORE THE DEALER PERFORMED THE RECALL WORK, MY CAR WAS PERFECTLY FINE. I CALLED DEALER ABOUT THIS SRS LIGHT ISSUE. DEALER SAID I HAVE TO PAY $101 FOR A COMPUTER DIAGNOSES PLUS EXTRA FEE TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOUND.   I, HOWEVER, DISAGREE BECAUSE THE SRS LIGHT WAS ON RIGHT AFTER THE DEALER PERFORMED THE RECALL WORK. BEFORE THAT, MY CAR WAS IN THE PERFECTLY SHAPE AND NEVER GOT INVOLVE IN ANY ACCIDENT. AS THE DEALER SAID, THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY WHILE THE SRS LIGHT IS ON.

THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT I TOOK MY CAR FOR REPAIRS WHICH CAME OUT TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, TOLD ME THAT THE REASON THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T WORK WAS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A DIRECT HIT, IN OTHER WORDS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THE AIRBAGS OR REPLACING THEM.  THEY STATED, THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL FROM HONDA ON THE AIRBAGS. THE COMMUNITY HONDA DEALERSHIP JUST REPLACED THE PARTS THAT WHERE DAMAGED IN THE COLLISION.

I WAS STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF INTERSTATE 35 AND HAD TO REQUEST AAA COME TOW MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP LUTE RILEY IN RICHARDSON.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSED SAT BY THE TIME I GOT THERE SO MONDAY MORNING WHEN I WENT IN I HAD RESEARCHED AND DISCOVERED THIS WAS A KNOWN DEFECT IN THE SIXTH GENERATION ACCORDS.  BUT I WAS INFORMED AT MIDDAY BY MY SERVICE ADVISOR SHAWN THAT I NEEDED TO PAY TO HAVE MY SOLENOIDS REPLACED SINCE THATS WHAT THE TECHNICIAN REPORTS AS THE PROBLEM SO ME BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT AND HEAVILY RELIANT ON MY TRANSPORTATION ESPECIALLY DURING FINALS WEEK PAID FOR IT. SURE ENOUGH COUPLE OF DAYS LATER SAME ISSUE WHERE THE CAR DIES AGAIN IN MY SCHOOL PARKING LOT AND I HAD IT TOWED ONCE AGAIN BY AAA OVER TO LUTE RILEY. THIS TIME WHEN I WENT IN ON THURSDAY MAY 6TH THEY SANG A DIFFERENT TUNE THAT MY TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED AND THAT IT WAS COVERED UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BY HONDA SO THEY WILL REPLACE IT FOR FREE BUT WILL NEED TO KEEP IT FOR A WEEK WHILE THEY ORDER ONE.  NOW MY ISSUE IS RETURNING THE $350 PLUS THAT I SPENT ON REPAIRING SOLENOIDS THAT WEREN'T IN NEED OF BEING REPLACED.

AFTER IT WAS REPLACED THE SRS (AIR BAG) LIGHT WAS ON AND WOULD NOT TURN OFF.

THE SYSTEM SHOULD  RESET ITSELF WHEN EVERYTHING IS NORMAL  SO THE CONSUMER DOES NOT HAVE TO  DRIVE AROUND IN A CAR WITH AIR BAGS THAT DO NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH.  TO HAVE THE CAR DISABLE THIS VITAL PART OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES BECAUSE THE VOLTAGE DROPPED BELOW A CERTAIN POINT MAKES NO SENSE.

AFTER MUCH PROTEST, DEALER CLAIMED THEY NEEDED TO  CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. LATER THAT DAY THEY AGREED TO REPLACE AT NO COST AS \"GOOD WILL\" GESTURE AND SCHEDULED REPAIR FOR NEXT DAY. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM ON BOTH THE ACCORD AND CIVIC AND THERE IS A NHTSA PENDING. REF ACTION # PE02072. I ALSO OWN A SATURN AND IT WAS RECALLED FOR A SIMILAR SEAT BRACKET PROBLEM . HONDA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM WITH A RECALL.     *JB",

HE SAID IT WAS LEAKING FLUID OUT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRANSMISSION AND ALL HE COULD DO WOULD BE TO FILL IT UP WITH THE SPECIAL FLUID THAT HONDA USES. SO $80.00 BUCKS LATER I GOT SOME FLUID IN IT AND THEN CALLED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO ASK WHY MY 2000 ACCORD THAT I PAID $25,000.00 HAD A BAD TRANSMISSION AFTER ONLY 72,000 MILES. I WAS TOLD THAT ,WELL THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 ACCORD AUTO TRANSMISSIONS. I AM BEING TOLD TO BRING IT INTO THE SHOP TO BE LOOKED AT FOR A FEE OF $72.00 AN HOUR AND THEY WOULD TRY TO DETECT THE PROBLEM. AND I AM BEING TOLD THAT SUPPOSEDLY THAT HONDA HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 72 MONTHS OR 100,000 MILES. I CAN ONLY HOPE TO GOD THAT THIS IS TRUE. OR I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST $3,500.00 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  WHY WAS I NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, OR THE TIME OF ALL THE DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES I HAD DONE?

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHO TOLD ME IT WAS AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 ACCORD AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO REMEDY OR RECALL FOR THE PROBLEM.  THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I THEN TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL AUTO SERVICE BUSINESS WHOM I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  THEY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY A BUILD-UP OF CARBON ON THE ACCELLERATOR LINKAGE- ESPECIALLY IN THE 2000 HONDA.  I HAD HIM CLEAN THE DEPOSIT ($60 PLUS $4.50 FOR CARBON SOLVENT) WHICH IMMEDIATELY REMEDIED THE STICKING.  HE TOLD ME THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE EVERY 10K MILES OR WHEVER IT BECOMES STICKY AGAIN.  I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND HONDA SHOULD COME UP WITH A CORRECTION AND RECALL OF ALL 2000 ACCORDS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED.  DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE WITH HONDA?

LEITH HONDA CHARGED ME $85 TO FIX IT. THEY DID NOT CHARGE US THE FIRST TIME. THEIR REASON IS THAT MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THIS STICKY GAS PEDAL PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY GASOLINE. THEY FURTHER CLAIMED THAT ALL OTHER VEHICLES HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE GASOLINE. THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO BRING THE CAR IT AND CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY ON A REGULAR BASIS. OTHERWISE THIS STICKY GAS PEDAL PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR. I HAVE SO MANY CAR IN THE LAST 25 YEARS AND NEVER HEARD OF THIS KIND OF NEWS. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY CAUSED BY THE STICKY GAS PEDAL. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND ME TO DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM?
