WATER PUMPS GO BAD, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. WHY WOULD ANY COMPANY PUT A WATER PUMP INSIDE THE MOTOR?!?! I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT IF I HAD KNOWN BECAUSE IT IS JUST WRONG.

I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED!!!! WHY IS THERE NO RECALL? I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A NEW ENGINE PUT IN, I'M 63 AND DISABLED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO.

A DEFECT INCLUDES ANY DEFECT IN PERFORMANCE, CONSTRUCTION, A COMPONENT, OR MATERIAL OF A MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTOR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT.' GENERALLY, A SAFETY DEFECT IS DEFINED AS A PROBLEM THAT EXISTS IN A MOTOR VEHICLE OR ITEM OF MOTOR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT THAT:   POSES AN RISK TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, AND MAY EXIST IN A GROUP OF VEHICLES OF THE SAME DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE, OR ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT OF THE SAME TYPE AND MANUFACTURE.\"    STEERING ISSUES DON'T POSE A RISK TO VEHICLE SAFETY?

THIS TRANSMISSION IS A JOINT DEVELOPMENT WITH GM AND I KNOW A BUICK OWNER WITH SIMILAR COMPLAINT AND BUICK COULD NOT REPAIR THE PROBLEM-HE TRADED CARS. WARRANTY WILL END FOR MY CAR THIS COMING JULY AND I THINK I WILL HAVE A HUGE REPAIR TO BE MADE ON THIS TRANSMISSION NEXT WINTER AS THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN STEADILY WORST SINCE LAST FALL (2012 WINTER SEASON) BUT ONLY WHEN TEMP IS 20 DEGREES OR COLDER.

THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED I WAS LEAVING MY DRIVEWAY.  IT DROPPED OUT OF GEAR AT ABOUT 5 MPH AND MADE A GROWLING NOISE.  I STOPPED THE CAR, THINKING SOMEHOW THE SHIFT LEVER WASN'T IN THE RIGHT POSITION, I PUT IT IN GEAR AND THE TRANSMISSION SLAMMED INTO FIRST.  I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, SO I JUST SHIFTED IT INTO NEUTRAL AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF.  WHEN I STARTED IT AGAIN EVERYTHING WORKED FINE. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF LATER I HAD A SIMILAR INCIDENT.  I WAS LEAVING A PARKING LOT AND I HAD REACHED A SPEED OF 5-15 MPH WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY GEAR, THEN IT SLAMMED INTO GEAR FOR A MOMENT, WENT A FEW FEET, THEN DROPPED OUT AGAIN, THEN SLAMMED INTO GEAR AGAIN.  I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE CURB IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF.  FORTUNATELY NO TRAFFIC WAS COMING.  I STARTED THE ENGINE AGAIN AND HAD NO FURTHER TROUBLE, BUT THIS TIME I TOOK IT INTO THE FORD DEALER WHERE I HAD BOUGHT IT NEW. THEY CHECKED IT OUT KEEPING IT TWO DAYS BUT SAID THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH EITHER THE TRANSMISSION OR THE SOFTWARE CONTROLLING IT. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO MEMORY ACCESS TO THE TRANSMISSION SO THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT OR VERIFY THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I WAS CHECKING OUT RECALLS AND SERVICE BULLETINS ON IT TODAY AND I FOUND THAT OTHER OWNERS REPORTED SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  IF I HAD BEEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC AND MY TRANSMISSION FAILED THE WAY IT DID, THERE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT.   *KB",

MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO HIT THE BRAKES, I DID, BUT THE BRAKES WOULD NOT DEPRESS OR BRAKE.  I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF EVERYTHING TO DO AND MONITOR THE CARS AROUND ME, AS WELL.  I TRIED HOLDING DOWN THE BRAKES HARD AND TAKING OFF WHILE THE CAR WENT FLYING BY TWO EXITS, I KNEW I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EXIT BECAUSE I COULDN'T STOP.

I KEPT PUSHING DOWN AND UP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  SUDDENLY, THE REVVING BEGAN TO SETTLE DOWN (A FAST DOWNWARD REVVING SOUND) AND I WAS ABLE TO BRAKE THE CAR.  I WAS UNSURE WHETHER TO PULL OVER SO I DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO MY DESTINATION WHICH WAS ONLY 3 EXITS AWAY.  I PARKED AND LOOKED AT THE CAR AND ESPECIALLY THE AREA NEAR MY FEET, THERE WAS NOTHING INTERFERING WITH THE BRAKES OR THE ACCELERATOR.
