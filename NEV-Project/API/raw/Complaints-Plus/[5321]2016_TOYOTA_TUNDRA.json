I RECONNECT THE IBC AND RESTARTED THE TRUCK, TRYING AGAIN; SAME ISSUE. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS, SAID THEY SAW BEFORE WITH NO RESOLVE, AND SUGGESTED I BUY AN AFTERMARKET BRAKE CONTROLLER, TOO.    I THEN LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND SEVERAL HUNDRED OTHERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM, REQUIRING THAT THEY BUY AN AFTERMARKET BRAKE CONTROLLER TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS ONE (TWO LINKS ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS COMPLAINT). THE DEALERS AND TOYOTA ARE UNABLE/UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

I HAVE TRIED 2 OTHER TRAILERS, AND TALKED TO MULTIPLE 2016 TUNDRA OWNERS ONLINE AND THIS PROBLEM IS CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL TUNDRA'S TOWING ANY TYPE TRAILER.  UNDER HARD BRAKNG AT ANY SPEED MY TRAILER WANTS TO JACKNIFE AND PUSH THE TRUCK OUT OF IT'S WAY, BECAUSE THE BRAKES ON THE TRUCK ARE ENGAGING TO MAX AND THE TRAILER BRAKES ARE HARDLY ENGAGING AT ALL EVEN ON MAX GAIN SETTING.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED AND TOYOTA IS NOT COMING FORWARD WITH A FIX.  THEY CLAIM THE CONTROLLER IS \"WORKING AS DESIGNED\", BUT I TOW 8000LBS BEHIND ME AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE TRAILER BRAKES A SERIOUS ACCIDENT IS JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO STEP IN AND FORCE TOYOTA TO ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR KILLED. LUCKILY THE MANUAL SLIDER STILL WORKS, BUT THAT IS A BANDAID SOLUTION EVERY TUNDRA OWNER CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO DRIVE AROUND MANUALLY APPLYING THE TRAILER BRAKES SEPARATE FROM THE FOOT BRAKE.

IT SEEMS THAT REGARDLESS OF THE POWER SETTING, NO NOTICEABLE POWER IS SUPPLIED TO THE TRAILER BRAKES, EVEN AT IT'S HIGHEST SETTING. IT FEELS LIKE THE TRAILER/CAMPER IS PUSHING THE TRUCK, WHICH CAN BE A SERIOUS ISSUE WHEN STOPPING.

I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WITH OTHER BREAK CONTROLLERS.     IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TOYOTA HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AS BEING AN ISSUE YET. AFTER TALKING TO MANY OTHER TUNDRA OWNERS EVERYONE HAS THE SAME ISSUE,  I'VE NOT TALKED TO ANYONE THAT HAS A WORKING INTEGRATED BREAK CONTROLLER IN THEIR 2016.

LOADED), THE HIGHEST GAIN SETTING SHOULD LOCK UP MY TRAILER BRAKES.  THE IBC SETTING FOR MY CAMPER IS ELECTRIC.  I TOOK MY TRUCK AND CAMPER TO THE TOYOTA DEALER SO THEY COULD TEST THE CONTROLLER WHILE HOOKED UP.

THEIR CONCLUSION WAS IN SPITE OF NOT FEELING THE BRAKES, THAT THE BRAKE CONTROLLER WAS WORKING.  TOYOTA SAYS IT'S OKAY, BUT IF I JACK-KNIFE MY CAMPER, I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACCIDENT.

HE COULD NOT OFFER ANY REASON FOR CHANGING THIS STANDARD FEATURE. OTHER THAN NOT SEEING THE GAUGES SHARPER AND CLEARER ONE SAFETY DEFECT IS PRESENT. THE TUNDRA HAS GAUGES INSTEAD OF WARNING LIGHTS FOR ENGINE OPERATIONS AND THEY ARE SMALLER THAN THE SPEEDOMETER/TACHOMETER . THE TEMP GAUGE IS LOCATED ON THE LOWER LEFT OF THE DASH AND CANNOT BE SEEN CLEARLY WITHOUT THE DASH ILLUMINATED BECAUSE THAT CORNER IS DARK IF IT IS CLOUDY OR EARLY OR LATE .
