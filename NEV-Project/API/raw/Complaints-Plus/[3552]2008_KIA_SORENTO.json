The vehicle was inspected by an independent mechanic, but I plan to take it to a dealership as well, it is available to be inspected upon request.

I WAS DIRECTED TO KIA OF AMERICA (1-800-333-4542) TO SUBMIT A REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST FOR THE REPAIR. MY CLAIM WAS DENIED SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAD NOT TAKEN THE CAR TO A KIA DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. I ASKED FOR AN APPEAL AND WAS DIRECTED TO THE REGIONAL OFFICE.

I ASSURED KIA OF AMERICA, IF WE HAD KNOWN THAT THE REPAIR WAS COVERED BY A WARRANTY, WE WOULD HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEWLY OPENED KIA DEALERSHIP.     BOTTOM LINE: KIA OF AMERICA DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR WARRANTY. OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS WITH THE SAFETY OF OUR FAMILY AND DRIVING A WELL-MAINTENANCED CAR.

WE WERE BASICALLY DISMISSED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT EVEN TELL THAT IT HAPPENED. THE THIRD TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK, TURNING ONTO THE ENTRANCE RAMP OF I-95, I LOST POWER AND COULD NOT ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY. I WAS FURIOUS AND FRIGHTENED OF THE POSSIBLE DANGER OF THE SITUATION, AND CALLED TO MAKE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT, THIS WAS THE 2ND TIME, WHICH BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO \"NORMAL\" AND NO RECORD IN THE COMPUTER. I HAD PRINTED OUT RESEARCH FOR MY HUSBAND TO TAKE WITH HIM TO SHOW THEM THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND THAT THE TCM WAS REPLACED, HOWEVER THEY DISMISSED HIM AND DID SOMETHING ELSE. IT WAS FINE FOR A WHILE, THEN HAPPENED AGAIN (APPROX DEC. 2010) WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING DOWN I-95, WE LOST POWER WHILE GOING 65 MPH AND THE ESC AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON.

MY SON REPORTS HEARING A LOUD BOOM FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE DASHBOARD VENTS.

THE OPERATOR SAID SHE HAD HIS VEHICLE FIRE ON THE OVERHEAD HIGHWAY CAMERA.  MY SON IS A CULINARY STUDENT AND RAPIDLY RETRIEVED HIS VALUABLE KNIFE ROLL FROM THE REAR SEAT FLOORBOARD, BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND SMOKE.  HE SAYS THE FD ARRIVED WITHIN 5 MINS AND DOUSED THE ENGINE FIRE.  THERE WAS EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE TO THE FRONT PASSENGER COMPARTMENT AND LESS SO TO THE REAR PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.  MY SON IS SMART, QUICK AND AGILE.  THUS, HE SUFFERED NO PHYSICAL INJURY,  BUT WAS QUITE DISTRAUGHT.  HE WILL DO WELL.  I AM AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN WITH 20 YRS OF EXPERIENCE.
