I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT AND CONDUCTED ONLINE RESEARCH INTO THE PERSISTENT PROBLEM OF FIESTA DOOR LATCH FAILURES. I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR'S MAIN NUMBER AND WAS TOLD MY VIN IS NOT ON THE LIST FOR RECALL # 15S16 (DOOR LATCH FAILURES). HOWEVER, MY CAR WAS PRODUCED AT THE SAME FACTORY, AND DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD, AS THE EFFECTED RECALLED FIESTA VEHICLES. MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED ON AUGUST 14, 2012, IN CUAUTITLAN, MEXICO. IN 2015, FORD MOTOR COMPANY ISSUED RECALL 15S16 FOR FIESTAS PRODUCED AT THE CUAUTITLAN PRODUCTION SITE FOR CARS DATING FEB 1, 2012 - MAY 31, 2013. I AM NOT CERTAIN WHAT FORD'S CRITERIA IS FOR SELECTING CERTAIN VINS FOR RECALL. HOWEVER, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS EFFECTED MANY FIESTA DRIVERS. I BELIEVE FORD HAS OMITTED SOME VINS FROM THE ORIGINAL RECALL LIST, AND MUST ADD EVERY VIN PRODUCED AT THAT CUAUTITLAN MEXICO PLANT DURING THE TIME FRAME SPECIFIED IN THE INITIAL RECALL FOR DOOR LATCH FAILURES. WITHOUT DOING SO, MYSELF AND OTHER CONSUMERS CANNOT BRING OUR VEHICLES INTO DEALERSHIPS FOR SAFETY INSPECTION AND PART REPLACEMENTS TO PREVENT LATCH FAILURES, AND, THEREFORE, REMAIN AT RISK OF OUR FIESTAS POSING A SAFETY ISSUE.",

FORD'S INVESTIGATION OF THESE VEHICLES HAS IDENTIFIED A RISK OF UNDER-HOOD FIRES.    IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLES, A LACK OF COOLANT CIRCULATION COULD CAUSE AN ENGINE TO OVERHEAT, RESULTING IN A CRACK IN THE CYLINDER HEAD. A CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD CAN RESULT IN A PRESSURIZED OIL LEAK. OIL THAT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH A HOT ENGINE SURFACE INCREASES THE RISK OF A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.

THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY CORRECTED BUT NO PERMANENT FIX.  THERE HAS BEEN A CLUTCH ON ORDER SINCE MARCH 7, 2015 AND  THE CONVERTER WAS DIAGNOSED ON MARCH 27, 2015 AND THOSE ARE NOT AVAILABLE EITHER.  I DRIVE ABOUT 600 MILES A WEEK AND REALLY NEED A DEPENDABLE CAR.  WHEN I GO TO PULL OUT INTO TRAFFIC THE TRANSMISSION BOGS DOWN SO I HAVE TO GIVE MYSELF AMPLE TIME TO GET OUT. I PURCHASED THIS CAR WITH THE EXPECTATIONS THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME A LONG REPAIR FREE LIFE.  I DID PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT AT THE RATE IT'S GOING THE CAR WILL NOT MAKE IT THAT FAR.  YOU WOULD THINK THAT FORD WOULD HAVE THE PARTS TO CORRECT THE ISSUES WITH THIS CAR.  EITHER FIX IT OR REPLACE IT. FORD IS TRULY LIVING UP TO IT NAME. FIX OR REPAIR DAILY.  I EVEN CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT THEY HAVE NEVER CALLED ME BACK EITHER.  MY DEALER HAS NO INFO EITHER.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE CAR ITSELF I FIND MYSELF WONDERING IF I WOULD EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER FORD.  IF THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR THE MONEY I PAID WHY GIVE THEM MY HARD EARNED MONEY WHEN THEY SELL ME A LEMON.  THERE IS ACTUALLY A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS CAR.  I HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO JOIN IT BUT I AM NOW CONSIDERING IT SINCE FORD DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE.  AS FOR THE DATE OF THE FIRST INCIDENT AND MILEAGE I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS.

I BROUGHT IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY. THEY SAY THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM OCCURRING WITH NUMEROUS FIESTA'S AND FOCUS'S, BUT CANNOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE UNAVAILABLE. I FEEL UNSAFE BEHIND THE WHEEL AND I FEAR MY CAR MAY BE IRREVERSIBLY DAMAGED, OR WORSE, SOMEONE MAY LOSE THEIR LIFE.  *TR",

APPROXIMATELY IN SEPTEMBER OF 2014 THE CAR WAS STILL HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND FORD SENT US A NOTICE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.

THEY REPAIRED THE DOOR.   ON 10/13/2014, I WENT TO RUN AN ERRAND AND WHEN I PUT THE KEY IN THE ADMISSION, IT INDICATED A DOOR WAS OPEN.  I THEN NOTICED THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  I DROVE IT TO JARRETT GORDON FORD AGAIN AND TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS FRIGHTENING.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD CHECK ALL 4 DOORS.

I DIDN'T REALLY THINK MUCH OF IT UNTIL I READ A NEWS STORY YESTERDAY THAT MENTIONED A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS WITH DOORS EVEN OPENING AT SPEED! I REALIZED THAT I SHOULD LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH THE DOORS BEING HARD TO LATCH, ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO NOTICE AND CLOSE THE DOORS PROPERLY EACH TIME IT HAS HAPPENED.    THE BACK DOORS ON THE FIESTA (THE SEDAN, AT LEAST) ARE SMALLER AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER THAN THE FRONT ONES, SO I THINK THAT MAY BE WHY THE FRONT ONES LATCH FINE ON THE FIRST TRY, BUT THE BACK DOORS ARE MORE TOUCHY.    I HAVEN'T BEEN BOTHERED MUCH BY THIS, BUT IF IT IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS ADDRESSED, I FELT YOU MIGHT FIND MY EXPERIENCE TO BE USEFUL INFORMATION WHILE LOOKING INTO IT! THANKS, HAVE A GREAT DAY!  *TR",

I RETURNED CAR TO DEALER ON JANUARY 8, 2013, BUT THE COULDN'T FIND PROBLEM. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE NOISE BECAME LOUDER, CAR SHUDDERED AND SURGED, AND BEGAN STICKING IN DRIVE. I RETURNED TO DEALER AGAIN ON MAY 29, 2014, AND DEALER TOLD ME ABOUT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH FORD FIESTAS.  I PICKED CAR UP ON JUNE 5, 2015 AND DROVE SHORT DISTANCE AND ALL POWER TO TRANSMISSION WENT OUT.  IT EVENTUALLY 'CAME BACK' AND I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO DEALERSHIP. THE PROBLEM WAS WORSE THAN WHEN I TOOK IT TO DEALER IN THE BEGINNING. THIS WAS A VERY SCARY SITUATION BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.  I HAVE HAD ONGOING PROBLEMS SINCE I PURCHASED CAR.  IT HAD 3 MILES ON IT THE DATE OF PURCHASE.  I FINANCED 21,049 TO GET CAR, AND CANNOT AFFORD TO TRADE CAR IN AND GO UPSIDE ON PAYMENTS.  THE CAR IS A LEMON!  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH FORD 3 TIMES ABOUT THE MATTER.  I AM SCARED TO RIDE IN THE CAR NOW.  I NEED A CAR TO GO DO WORK DAILY.  FORD SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND REPLACE MY CAR WITH A 'BETTER' CAR.  IT IS A SHAME THAT A LARGE CONGLOMERATE LIKE FORD CAN SELL A 'LEMON' AND A CONSUMER LIKE ME (SINGLE MOM) WITH LIMITED INCOME HAS TO 'TAKE IT.\"  FORD SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I HAVE RESEARCHED THE PROBLEMS AND FOUND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE TO MY CASE.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN MY STATE   ABOUT THE MATTER, AND SPOKE WITH GENERAL MANAGER AT DEALERSHIP.  FORD HAS OFFERED TO EXTEND MY BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY TO 75,000 MILES OR 5 YEARS (NOV. 2017) BUT I AM STILL SCARED TO RIDE IN THE CAR.  IT'S DANGEROUS.  *TR",

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ONLY ONE WEEK AFTER THE PURCHASE. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE NOISES WERE NORMAL.    ONE MONTH AFTER I HEARD THE GRINDING NOISES MORE FREQUENTLY AT FIRST AND SECOND GEAR, ROUGH GRINDING, I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER FOR SOME DAYS, AFTER THIS, THEY TOLD ME SOME NOISES ARE NORMAL AND GAVE ME AN EXPLANATION LETTER FROM FORD, THE CHARACTERISTICS THEY TALK ABOUT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES I HEARD, BUT THEY TOLD ME I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL 5K MILES.     AFTER 6400 MILES, I TOOK THE CAR BACK AGAIN EXPLAINING THAT THE CAR IS MAKING LOUDER NOISES NOT ONLY FROM 5 TO 15MPH BUT I ALSO HEARD THE SOUND EVEN AT 60MPH, THE CAR SHAKES FROM TIME TO TIME DURING THE LOUDER NOISES AND THIS NOISES SOUNDS DIFFERENT EVERY DAY, DIFFERENT SOUNDS FOR THE SAME SHIFT, AND NOW, THIS SOUNDS ARE LONGER, FROM 3 SECONDS UP TO 50 SECOND OR MORE, THIS IS NOT A SHIFT. I HAVE READ THE LETTER FROM FORD AND THEY SAY A SLIGHT GRINDING NOISE, THAT IS NOT THE DESCRIPTION FOR A SOUND WHICH LAST MORE THAN 30 SEC (DISTANCE MORE THAN 1500 FEET WITH A GRINDING NOISES).    I ALSO EXPLAIN THAT, I DROVE A FIESTA WITH ONLY 6 MILES, SAME YEAR, TRANSMISSION AND TEMPERATURE BUT DIFFERENT SOUNDS. THIS ONE MADE A LIGHT GRINDING NOISE JUST AS THE FORD LETTER DESCRIBES. THEIR RESPONSE, THE NOISES CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM CAR TO CAR'. BUT THE  DIAGNOSTIC TIPS' FROM FORD'S  LETTER SAYS;  THE CAR HAS TO BE COMPARED WITH A LIKELY VEHICLE, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF THE NOISES ARE NORMAL OR NOT'. I BELIEVE THE FORD FIESTA DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME QUALITY.    AFTER CHECKING THE CAR BY THE 3RD TIME AND LOADED AN UPGRADE FOR THE SOFTWARE, THEY TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING IS NORMAL, BUT TO DATE, THIS UPGRADE DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.  *TR",

THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE SHOP SINCE 8/6 (IT IS NOW 8/22), WITH NO RESOLUTION IN SIGHT.  THEY BROUGHT IN A FORD TECHNICIAN FROM GOD-KNOWS-WHERE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO FIX IT; IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FIXED 2 DAYS AGO TO NO AVAIL.  I AM NOW CLOSING IN ON THE TIME PERIOD FOR INVOKING THE NY STATE LEMON LAW; I HOPE I CAN GET MY $ BACK AND SEND THIS THING TO THE DUMP!  FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THESE CRAPPY THINGS ASAP!  *TR",

I WAS PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR BUT IT HAD NO RPMS AND THE CAR BEGAN ROLLING BACKWARDS. SUDDENLY, THE TRANSMISSION (?) KICKED IN AND THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD AT 20MPH.

DIFFICULTY PULLING STEEP HILLS/DRIVEWAYS & DOESN'T REVERSE AT TIMES. WE'VE NEARLY BEEN REAR-ENDED & BROADSIDED ON MORE THAN ONCE; I ALMOST REAR-ENDED SOMEONE ELSE. CRUISE CONTROL PROBLEM ON INTERSTATE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MY FAMILY KILLED; TAPPED BRAKES TO DISENGAGE CRUISE CONTROL AS I WAS BEING PASSED ON ONE SIDE & WAS APPROACHING A SLOW MOVING VEHICLE. I PULLED TO THE LEFT LANE & PROCEEDED PAST THE SLOWER VEHICLE BUILDING MY SPEED BACK UP TO 70; I PUSHED THE RESUME BUTTON & SUDDENLY THE CAR'S SPEED DROPPED DRASTICALLY & THEN JUMPED BACK UP CAUSING THE RPMS TO REV VERY HIGH BEFORE RETURNING TO NORMAL.
