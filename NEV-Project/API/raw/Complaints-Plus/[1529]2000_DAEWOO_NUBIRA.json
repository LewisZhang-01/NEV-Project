THE LIGHT REMAINED ON FOR OVER A YEAR. IN JANUARY OF 2004 I TOOK MY CAR FOR THE NOW REQUIRED EMISSIONS TEST, IT FAILED DUE TO THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR. I PURCHASED THE REQUIRED PART, A CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR, ON 1/15/04 AND PAID A MECHANIC TO PERFORM THE REPAIRS. THE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AGAIN WITHIN 3 DAYS OF REPAIR. ON SEPTEMBER 12TH, I RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION OF DEFECT FROM DAEWOO MOTORAMERICA, ADRESSING THE SAID CAMSHAFT SENSOR. ONE MONTH LATER THE CAR BEGAN TO HESITATE WHILE I WAS DRIVING, AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE SMOOTHLY, FINALLY IT IN MAY, WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE INSTUMENT PANEL CAME ON, THE CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE AND THEN JUST SHUT DOWN. IN REGARDS TO THE SENSOR, I BELIEVE THAT DAEWOO MOTORS WAS NEGLIGENT IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AFTER VISITING SEVERAL CONSUMER AFFAIRS SITES, IT IS APPARENT THAT THIS DEFECT MANIFESTED ITSELF AS EARLY AS 2/2002 FOR THE MAJORITY OF CAR OWNERS, YET DAEWOO HAS TAKEN 2 1/2 YEARS TO NOTIFY OWNERS. *AK",

PULLED INTO A PARKING SPACE WITH FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL, ENGINE SUDDENLY RACED (AS IF I\u0019D FLOORED THE ACCELERATOR) AND CAR SURGED FORWARD (FOOT STILL PRESSING BRAKE).  HAD TO TURN IGNITION OFF TO STOP CAR.  HAPPENED AGAIN (SAME DAY) AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL.  WOULD HAVE REAR-ENDED VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME IF I HAD NOT ALLOWED FOR DISTANCE OF TWO CAR LENGTHS BETWEEN IT/MYSELF.  MY 62-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OWNS THIS VEHICLE.  SAYS SHE USES EMERGENCY HAND BRAKE WHEN THIS HAPPENS, AND INITIALLY COMPLAINED OF SAME PROBLEM OVER A YEAR AGO.  DEALER (HILLSIDE AUTO-MALL, HILLSIDE, NJ) SAID NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND!  ASKED IF PROBLEM COULD POSSIBLY BE DUE TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT?  DEALER STATED, \u001cTHAT\u0019S AN ISSUE YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH THE MANUFACTURER.  WE JUST SELL THE CARS!\u001d    STEERING CONTROL:  (RECURRING, UNPREDICTABLE)    WHILE DRIVING AND/OR ACCELERATING VEHICLE WILL UNEXPECTEDLY PULL (SHARPLY) TO THE RIGHT AND BECOME DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  BEHAVIOR EXTREMELY PRONOUNCED IN WET WEATHER AND WHEN ACCELERATING!  NO NOTICEABLE PROBLEM FOUND, BUT SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ARE ON FILE!    NOTIFICATION OF RECALL:    DID NOT RECEIVE VEHICLE RECALL, NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 02V257000, ADDRESSING VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD NO. 106, \u001cBRAKE HOSES\u001d.  WILL SEEK ASSISTANCE OF THE DEALERSHIP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.    FOR THE RECORD: VEHICLE IS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD, AND (CURRENTLY) HAS REGISTERED LESS THAN 20,000 MILES.  OF THE MANY COMPLAINTS ON RECORD AT THIS SITE, THOSE CONCERNING SPEED CONTROL AND STEERING CONTROL ARE THE MOST TROUBLING.  ARE THEY COINCIDENTAL!!!  MY MOTHER WILL TRY (AGAIN) TO GET THESE ISSUES RESOLVED AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED.  GUT FEELING, HOWEVER, IS THAT CONCERNS WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED UNTIL SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED, OR WORSE.  I PRAY IT DOES NOT COME TO THAT!",
