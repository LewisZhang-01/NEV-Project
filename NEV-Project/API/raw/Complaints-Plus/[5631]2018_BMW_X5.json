The car would not move forward in drive but I had enough momentum to move partially in the shoulder lane. Next the car began to drift backwards so I kept my foot on the brakes until the tow truck arrived. I had the car towed to the BMW dealer and the next day I was informed that it needed a new transmission for a cost of $26,000.00. My car has under 72,000 miles and I maintained all recommended preventative maintenance. I bought it brand new for $84,000.00 with 2 miles. Please investigate this obvious manufacturer defect as I believe the dealer and/or BMW should handle all costs. I was lucky since innocent commuters could have been severely injured and killed; including myself. The experience was terrifying and presents a safety Hazzard to the public. These tech heavy vehicles are good for the environment and societal progress but they must perform according to the expectations and requirements of the US Government. The BMW Service Dept. has decided upon merit to my complaint and lowered my  contribution to $8,000.00 after I just paid $84,000.00 for the new vehicle. Again, I believe they should handle all costs. US consumers expect safety, reliability and dependability on all vehicles and when that fails, we only have your Agency to supersede and demand justice. Thank you for this opportunity.

BMW knows about something and they have not taken any action to prevent it, rather the answer is \"it happens with all the cars, so it is okay to happen with BMW model too\". I feel it is hazardous for 2 reasons: 1. While driving in rain it suddenly starts leaking which deters an immediate attention from the road. It was by the grace of god, no one was next to me  on the road, otherwise an impulse movement would have resulted in the accident. 2. Now, since the carpet soaked the water, although after drying with vacuum, it has started smelling. May be mold is forming which can be hazardous too.  BMW knows the issue but does nothing to prevent it from happening and then they gave me an estimate of about $1000 to fix the drainage issue and dry the carpet out. BMW sold me this car as a certified pre-owned and 10 months later I am having the issue of water leaking in the car for which I need to pay to get it fixed.",
