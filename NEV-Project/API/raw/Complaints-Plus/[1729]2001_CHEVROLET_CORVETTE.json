The fuel supply cuts off at 2 miles per hour. Many of the dealers did a faulty job fixing the problem, causing it to recur. My 2001 Corvette (with less than 17,000 miles) repeatedly experiences this problem. GM says they will not warrant this known defective design, due to the recall expiring. According to an internet search on \u201cCorvette Steering Column Lock\u201d, there no telling how many unhappy Corvette owners this has created. Need your help getting this $50,000 car back on the road.",

        "summary": "We purchased the car on 12/17/21. I went to Costco on 12/18/21 to get gas. I had a preset amount of $50 to put into the car. When I got to $50 I shut the pump off myself, the tank was not full enough for it to shut off automatically. As I look down on the ground I saw a fluid running out from underneath the car and rolling along the ground. I touched it with my finger and discovered it was gasoline. I put the nozzle back into the holder  and I checked underneath the car and saw it was dripping from the drivers side in the area just behind the drivers door. I pulled the car over to the side to inspect it further. By now the gas had stopped dripping. Since the exhaust pipe is right next to the fuel tank I was afraid of a fire or explosion. Had  some fuel vapors but they dissipated shortly after.  My gas gauge was registering full at this time. Since then I have not had any gasoline leaks and or vapors present. I have not put any more gas in the car since then. (I contacted the previous owner and he said in an email response, if you overfill there is a vent hole that gas will leak out of at the top of the filler neck. It happened once when I put like 20 gallons in it.)  I did some research and found that there is a problem with the Corvette gas tanks and or the crossover tube. I think this is a dangerous situation, thinking that if that gas ignited, the car and my passenger could have caught fire and possibly ignited the Costco gas station with an explosion. (This car will be going into the repair shop in January to have a diagnostic smoke test done to determine where the leak and or leaks are coming from.) I hope the NHTSA recognizes this as a very dangerous situation. All of this will be coming out of my own pocket for the repairs necessary to make this car safe to drive and not be dangerous to myself and family.  I consider this a very serious dangerous situation.",
