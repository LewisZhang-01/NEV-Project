Affects driver safety due to acute driver distraction while trying to correct, and disables driver warning lights and all information systems, including towing related warnings (transmission temp/coolant temp, etc)  Dealer advises to bring it back when it is occurring, but occurrences are not predictable, nor do they occur on a regular basis.   Cause is unknown, but since dimmer switch does not correct this issue, it is the probable cause.",

Truck slowed to 3 mph so we pulled to shoulder and turned the vehicle off. Truck had blown the hose off the the turbo. We reclamped and restarted. Displayed check engine light, reduced power & regen message to keep driving however truck wouldn\u2019t go over a 3mph crawl. Truck lost all power, everything shut down and wouldn\u2019t restart. No dash lights, no error, no crank, no power. We were dead on the highway in the truck lane while towing.   This Truck goes into reduced power mode every time it tries to regen and we have had it to the dealer multiple times however, the problem continues to get worse. When it does regen, sometimes it takes hours. Dealer says needed a manual regen & that is their solution. Yet problem persists.",
