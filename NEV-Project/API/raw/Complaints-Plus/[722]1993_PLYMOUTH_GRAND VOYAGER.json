SEVERAL MECHANIC SHOPS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM OR SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS. AFTER DOING RESEARCH INTO THIS MATTER, I HAVE FOUND THAT SEVERAL PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER OWNERS HAVE HAD THESE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS.

THIS SUBMISSION IS TO DOCUMENT A SIMILAR SAFETY ISSUE THAT OCCURRED 7 WEEKS AFTER THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WAS 'FIXED'.  I WILL REPEAT THE INFORMATION FROM MY ORIGINAL SUBMISSION FOR REFERENCE.    ORIGINAL SUBMISSION (10/22/98):  I HAD A RECALL PERFORMED ON THE ABS SYSTEM IN 1996.  AT THAT TIME, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT A DEFECTIVE DESIGNED PART WAS BEING REPLACED WITH A NEWER DESIGNED PART AND THAT THE ABS SYSTEM WOULD NOW FUNCTION PROPERLY.  IN AUGUST OF 1998, WHILE DRIVING DOWN A ROAD AT 35 MPH, I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE AND HAD NO BRAKES AT ALL.  FORTUNATELY, NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SPARTAN CHRYSLER PLYMOUTH IN MURRAY, UT WHO INFORMED ME THE ABS HYDRAULIC SYSTEM 'PISTON ASSEMBLY' HAD FAILED.  THEY INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE SAME PART FOR WHICH THE RECALL WAS ISSUED IN 1996.  THEY TOLD ME (IN 1998) THAT IN 1996 THE RECALL ONLY CONSISTED OF CHECKING THE PART TO SEE IF IT WAS BAD.  MY QUESTION IS THAT I WONDER IF THE RECALL WAS REALLY JUST TO CHECK THE PART?  THIS SEEMS LIKE A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.  THE PART CAN WORK TODAY AND PASS THE RECALL 'TEST' ONLY TO FAIL TOMORROW AND CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH BECAUSE THE VEHICLE LOSES THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  WOULDN'T IT BE SAFER TO REMOVE THE FAULY DESIGNED PART AND REPLACE IT WITH A KNOWN FIXED PART?    UPDATE (11/18/98)  ON 7 NOVEMBER, THE BRAKING SYSTEM OF MY VEHICLE FAILED WITH IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS AS BEFORE.  WITHOUT WARNING, THERE WAS NO BRAKING SYSTEM IN THE VEHICLE.  AGAIN, WE WERE FORTUNATE TO NOT CAUSE AND ACCIDENT.  I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE SAME SPARTAN DEALERSHIP.  THIS TIME THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILED 'ACCUMULATOR PUMP' IN THE ABS SYSTEM.  THEY INSIST THE TWO FAILURES (2 MONTHS APART) ARE TOTALLY UNRELATED, THAT THERE IS NO HISTORY OF ABS FAILURES IN THIS MODEL OF VAN, AND THAT THERE IS NO UNDERLYING PROBLEM WHICH IS CAUSING THESE PARTS TO FAIL.
