        "summary": "The day we took our Porsche home, we noticed a lot of heat generation in the car- but we thought it will be fine going further, given the attention to detail of Porsche's Automobile Engineering.  The following days were not any better for my daughter- she missed a major accident because of the unexpected burnt smell and loud warnings of an overheat of the engine by Porsche in the middle of a highway.  Due to her excellent driving record for the past 5 years, she was able to manage and stop in the middle of the highway at the curb of the road.  She panicked so much so that, she stopped using the Porsche and borrowed our other cars, Benz and Lexus.  I requested her to give Porsche another chance yesterday night.  The same situation repeated again within a span of 10 minutes of her journey in Porsche; she had to stop in the middle of the road again due to engine overheat and burning smell and I went to pick her up as she got really scared.  My son immediately informed the Hennessey Porsche North Atlanta, Georgia, the USA about this repeated situation but seems like they do not care at all.  I think you must be aware that Dealerships play the most crucial role between your loyal customers and Porsche.   We have not dared to take the Porsche out again after yesterday.  The car smelled so burnt, the whole garage smelled bad and we had to move the car into the open driveway.   THE CONSUMER STATED THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE DEALER ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE, BUT THE FAILURE PERSISTED. THE MANUFACTURER OFFERED $1000.00 IN COMPENSATION. THE CONSUMER REQUESTED TO BE REFUNDED TOTALLY FOR THE VEHICLE.",

WITHIN THE FIRST 1000 MILES AND IN LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS I EXPERIENCED  A SERIOUS LACK OF ACCELERATION ON TWO OCCASIONS WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN, I REPORTED THIS TO THE DEALER AND WAS ADVISED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY DRIVER ERROR CAUSED BY OPERATING THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR USING BOTH FEET. I DO NOT DRIVE AN AUTOMATIC CAR USING TWO FEET.  ALSO, I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THEY CHECKED WITH PORSCHE AND THERE ARE RECORDS OF THIS TYPE OF EVENT. I CHECKED ON THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS DATING BACK SEVERAL YEARS.  THIS LACK OF ACCELERATION HAS OCCURRED FOUR MORE TIMES. THE DEALER HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE AND KEPT MY VEHICLE ON TWO OCCASIONS TO TRY AND DUPLICATE THE EVENT TO NO AVAIL. ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THE DEALER REPLACED THE TRANSFER CASE BUT THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY, THE DEALER CALLED IN THE PORSCHE ZONE MANAGE WHO I AM TOLD WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS CONDITION AND REFERRED TO IT AS A SAFETY FEATURE TO PREVENT UNINTENDED ACCELERATION. HE CLAIMED THAT THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL OPERATION.  I CALL IT A SAFETY HAZARD. IN FOUR MONTHS I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR 3200 MILES. THIS SO-CALLED SAFETY FEATURE HAS ENGAGED ON ONLY SIX OCCASIONS, ALWAYS ON LEFT HAND TURNS FROM A COMPLETE STOP. WHEN THIS HAPPENS I NEVER KNOW WHEN THE ACCELERATION WILL CUT OUT OR HOW LONG I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE. UP TO NOW, THE FEATURE HAS NEVER ENGAGED IN RIGHT HAND TURNS, IN FORWARD OR REVERSE.  I HAVE CHECKED THE OWNERS MANUAL CAREFULLY AND THERE IS NO MENTION OF \"UNINTENDED ACCELERATION\" NOR IS THERE ANY MENTION OF  A SAFETY FEATURE PROGRAMMED IN THE CAR.
