THEN ANOTHER ONE WILL APPEAR THAT SAYS, 'LIFTGATE AJAR', OR 'VEHICLE APPROACHING FROM LEFT'. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THERE ARE NO CARS NEARBY. IT RANDOMLY HAPPENS WHEN PARKED AS WELL AS WHEN DRIVING. IT CAN BE VERY STARTLING WHEN THE ONE COMES ON THAT SAYS ANOTHER VEHICLE IS APPROACHING SINCE THE DINGING IS MUCH FASTER AND IS INTENDED TO LET YOU KNOW OF A POSSIBLE ACCIDENT. IT DOES IT ALL THE TIME. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME IT HAS HAPPENED BUT WE GOT A RECALL NOTICE EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT THIS WAS. THEN I LOOKED IT UP SINCE WE NEVER RECEIVED ANOTHER MAILER TO LET US KNOW WHEN PARTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, AND THAT IS WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE RECALL IS FOR SOMETHING ELSE.",

FINALLY, ONE MORNING, LIGHT COMES ON, POWER IS LOST AND I ALTER MY PLANS FOR THE DAY TO DRIVE STRAIGHT TO THE REPAIR SHOP, LEAVE THE CAR RUN AND DEMAND THAT THEY PULL THE CODES RIGHT THEN AND THERE BECAUSE IF I TURNED IT OFF, IT WOULD RESET AND I'D BE STUCK DRIVING IT AGAIN UNTIL THE CYCLE REPEATED ITSELF.  THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL 5 CODES AND I ENDED UP PAYING $822.08 FOR A THROTTLE BODY W/SENSOR, THROTTLE BODY GASKET, AND PEDAL.  OF COURSE, AT 40,000 MILES, NOTHING IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ANY LONGER.  THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THIS IS SEARCHING ONLINE AND DISCOVERING THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM FOR FORD OWNERS SINCE 2011.  AT ONE TIME, FORD EVEN AVOIDED A RECALL TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, BY OFFERING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO HAD YET TO HAVE THEIR THROTTLE BODY FAIL.  IT IS CLEAR THAT FORD MERELY WANTED TO AVOID THE BAD PUBLICITY OF A RECALL BY THIS ACTION.  FORD HAS NOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF THESE REPAIRS.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I CONTACTED FORD WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION AND PHOTOS OF MY INJURIES AND FORD DID NOT EVEN OFFER ANY FORM OF SYMPATHY OR RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  THEY DENIED MY CLAIM AND OFFERED NO HELP! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF ANY VEHICLE ON OUR DRIVEWAY IN ANY GEAR OTHER THAT PARK. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH AND PHYSICS ARE PROOF ENOUGH. THOUGH NOTHING MECHANICALLY DEFECTIVE WAS FOUND BY FORD, IT HAPPENED, PERIOD. I WAS INJURED BUT LUCKY THAT NEITHER MY SON NOR OTHERS WERE HURT. I DID NOTHING TO CAUSE THIS; IT WAS A FAILURE OF THE VEHICLE SOMEHOW BUT FORD STATED THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM, THEY'RE DENYING MY CLAIM.",
