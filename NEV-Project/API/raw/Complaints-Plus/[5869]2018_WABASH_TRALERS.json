WHILE DRIVING 45 MPH, THE ABS INDICATOR ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL AND THE ABS INDICATOR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAILER REMAINED ILLUMINATED WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS. THE TRAILER WAS TAKEN TO TWO DEALERS AND AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ABS SENSOR IN THE WHEEL HOUSING WAS NOT COMPLETELY \"PLUGGED IN.\" THE TRAILER WAS REPAIRED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN THE RAIL AND THE SECURING DEVICE ON THE LOAD SECUREMENT MECHANISM THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE LOAD SECUREMENT SYSTEM TO FAIL, THUS CAUSING THE TRAILER TO LOSE ITS LOAD. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS AGREED THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE. THE TRAILER WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE THAT STATED THAT THE TRAILER MET MINIMUM FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND WOULD NOT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 6,500.",
