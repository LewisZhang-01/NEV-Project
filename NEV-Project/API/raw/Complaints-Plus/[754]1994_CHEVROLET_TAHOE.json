I JUST PICKED IT UP FROM THE SHOP AFTER HAVING THE EGR VALVE CLEANED (AMONG SEVERAL OTHER THINGS), ONLY TO HAVE IT LAST FOR THE 20 MINUTE DRIVE HOME BEFORE IT STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT MAY STILL BE THE EGR VALVE BEING CLOGGED AGAIN - AND TO EXPECT THAT TO BE A REGULAR PROBLEM.  IF IT'S NOT THE EGR THAT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM, THEN IT IS LIKELY THE FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE PROBLEM IS, THE LITTLE PLASTIC TUBE THAT I NEED ON THE REGULATOR CANNOT BE BOUGHT ALONE.  RATHER, I HAVE THE BUY THE WHOLE KIT AND PAY OVER $500 AND IT MAY NOT FIX IT BECAUSE THE EGR IS GOING TO BE ON ONGOING PROBLEM.  I HAVE SPENT THE LAST WEEK RESEARCHING CHEVY COMPLAINTS ON THIS MODEL AND HAVE READ COUNTLESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS EXACT PROBLEM.  LIKE MOST OF THE CHEVY OWNERS THAT POSTED COMPLAINS ON VARIOUS SITES, I AM COMPLETELY FURIOUS THAT A VORTEC ENGINE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO WONDERFUL, IS SEEMINGLY JUNK.  WHY AM I GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY EGR VALVE CLEANED A MINIMUM OF ONCE A WEEK JUST TO KEEP IT ON THE ROAD?  WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR A $500 \"KIT\" WHEN ALL I NEED IS A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE?  I'M SORRY, I KNOW THAT SOME PARTS ARE EXPENSIVE ON CARS, BUT THIS IS A RIDICULOUS WAY TO ROB THE CONSUMER!  THIS SUV IS A DEATH-TRAP IN MY OPINION!  JUST DRIVING AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD TO SEE IF IT WOULD STALL, I ALMOST HIT A LITTLE BOY ON A BICYCLE WHEN IT DID STALL AND I LOST ALL POWER!  I AM TERRIFIED TO PUT THIS TRUCK ON THE ROAD! I NEED TO HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO WORK AND I PRAY TO GOD THAT I DON'T STALL OUT PULLING INTO TRAFFIC.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  ANY HELP OR ASSISTANCE THAT YOU CAN LEND WOULD BE SO APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU!*AK",
