LAST WEEK I WAS DRIVING IT AND I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE A THUMP, I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND SAW THE SPARE TIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I PULLED OVER AND PUT THE SPARE IN THE BED. WHEN I GOT HOME I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK AND NOTICED THE SPAIN TIER AREA WAS TOTALLY ROTTED OUT.   YESTERDAY I PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND HEAR A SQUEAKING NOISE. I LOOKED AROUND AND NOTICED THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER CORNER OF THE BED WAS HANGING. I LOOKED AT THE AREA AND WHAT HELD THE BED UP WAS TOTALLY ROTTED OUT. WE ARE NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THE TRUCK!!! WHAT CAN WE DO?  *TR",

THE FIRST INCIDENT CAUSED MY TRUCK TO PUSH THRU A GATE,  DAMAGING THE GATE AND THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  IN THIS CASE, THE ENGINE DID FINALLY DROP TO AN IDLE.  I THOUGHT THE BEHAVIOR MUST BE A FLUKE, SO DIDN'T REPORT THE INCIDENT.   THE  2ND THRU 4TH INCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED ON A LIMITED ACCESS ROAD IN OMAHA (DODGE STREET) AT STOP SIGNS AND AT A GAS STATION OUTSIDE OMAHA, AND AS I WAS NEARING A STOP THE ENGINE STARTED ACCELERATING AND PULLING THE VEHICLE FORWARD.  MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES ALLOWED ME TO STAY STATIONARY SO NO VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS WERE HIT, BUT CAUSED MY REAR WHEELS TO BURN RUBBER.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE TO STOP THE ACCELERATION.  THE MOST DANGEROUS INCIDENT WAS WHEN THIS OCCURRED AT A GAS STATION, WHEN I WAS PULLING SLOWLY TO A GAS PUMP BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE AND THE STRONG ACCELERATION BEGAN.

ALSO A NEW ENGINE SHOULD BE INSTALLED OR VEHICLE TRADED AS THIS ENGINE IS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE.  ALL THE MEANWHILE THE MAIN REASON FOR TAKING THE VEHICLE IN FOR REPAIRS THREE TIMES PRIOR WAS TO FIX THE HUGE THUMP AND DELAY ON ACCELERATION THAT ALMOST CAUSED ME TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT!  THE DEALER SAID THIS WAS NORMAL FOR 4WD TRUCKS AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  YET EVERY 4WD I'VE DRIVEN, EVEN ONES WITH OVER 100K MILES ON THEM, ACCELERATE SMOOTHLY WITH NO THUMPING OR DELAY IN ACCELERATION.  NEARING THE EXPIRATION ON MY WARRANTY DUE TO MILEAGE, I FEEL THE DEALERSHIP WAS TRYING TO PUSH THE ACTUAL REPAIRS OFF UNTIL THEN.  THEY EVEN SAID THAT THE CAUSE OF THE THUMP WAS THAT THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTS WERE LOOSE.  SO THEY \"REPAIRED\" THAT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT AND THE ISSUE STILL REMAINS.  THIS IS WHERE I STAND CURRENTLY AND AM TRYING TO GET THE TRUCK BACK IN THE SHOP, ONCE AGAIN, TO HAVE THIS ISSUE FIXED SO THAT I DO NOT ACTUALLY GET IN AN ACCIDENT.

GOODYEAR TELLS ME THAT FORD HAS ISSUED A BROADCAST SERVICE BULLETIN TO ITS DEALERS TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH A LARGER SIZE.  HAVE NO ACCESS TO THIS BULLETIN BUT QUESTIONED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO BROADCAST BULLETINS.  FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THIS TYPE OF TIRE IS NOT EXPECTED TO WEAR NORMALLY BECAUSE OF ITS DESIGN.  WHY THEN PUT IT ON THE VEHICLE?

WAS ADVISED BY FORD THAT THIS IS NORMAL OPERATION EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN (NHTSA # 0179/FORD #01-11-2) TO ADDRESS THIS EXACT CONCERN FOR 2001 MODEL YEAR FORD RANGERS.  THE SUMMARY DESCRIPTION STATES: SOME VEHICLES BUILT BEFORE 3/26/2001 MAY EXHIBIT A FUEL GAUGE THAT DROPS FROM FULL TOO FAST OR INDICATES LESS THAN THE ACTUAL FUEL LEFT IN HE TANK (EXCESSIVE TANK RESERVE).  WAS ADVISED THAT THIS APPROXIMATE 6 GALLON RESERVE WAS THERE TO ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO MAKE IT TO A FILLING STATION SAFELY WITH THE TANK ON E.  THIS IS TELLING ME THAT WHEN THE TANK READS ALMOST EMPTY THERE IS STILL OVER A QUARTER TANK OF FUEL IN THE TANK.  WITH THE GAUGE READING THIS WAY YOU ARE NOT SURE HOW MUCH FUEL YOU HAVE.

HE HAS NOT TESTED THE ISSUE ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE WE WERE PRESSED FOR TIME. THE SERVICE MANAGER AND AUTO BODY MANAGER DID AGREE THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT STRAIGHT ALONG THE FRONT AND TOP EDGES AND AGREED TO PERFORM A REPAIR AND INSTALL A NEW DOOR FROM THE FACTORY. THE PROBLEM THERE WAS THAT I WAS TOLD THAT A DOOR INSTALLED AS A \"REPAIR\" WOULD BE PAINTED AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE QUALITY OF A FACTORY INSTALLED DOOR. THE SERVICE MANAGER ALSO STATED THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT A \"NEW\" DOOR WOULD FIT ANY BETTER. I ADMIRE HIM FOR HIS HONESTY TO THE END.
