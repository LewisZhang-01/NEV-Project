An oil consumption issue will lead to low oil and low oil pressure which can lead to a fire. Problem has been confirmed by an independent service center. Vehicle has been inspected by a certified automotive technician. Vehicle loses oil close to 100 miles and the add engine oil display on the Driver Information Center.   Every trip that is close to 100 miles will cause oil consumption and the Add Engine Oil Will display. Vehicle was taken to a repair shop and i was informed that some Chevrolet Silverado Trucks engines will consume oil due to excessive amount of oil going to the pistons. The pistons result with damage to the piston rings and will need to be replaced. In the long run the engine will lose power start to smoke lose oil pressure and low compression which could lead to a fire .No recall was ever posted concerning this issue. I thought the consumption was due to viscosity breakdown until i noticed it got worse. I did some research and asked several silverado owners and they all had the same issue. I confirmed the issue when i took the vehicle to the technician.This vehicle only has 73,730 miles and i am the first owner.",

Air and heat switch\u2019s back and forth. Door locks cycle up and down. Have to reset radio and clock after the power failed. This is not from a dead battery. All I do to reset it all is to put a battery booster to battery terminals and switch booster on and off. Truck is back to normal. Most recent advent was all this at 1 time. Door locks cycle, radio turns on and off, ac changes to heat, low fuel and seat belt alarms start sounding, instrument cluster act irrationally, speed odometer goes from 20 to60 back and forth with truck cutting off at 20 and powering to 60. After several miles of driving everything is back to normal and I drive straight to my mechanic. Cut the truck off and Bingo, acts like there is not a battery in the truck. Nothing at all electrical. Total silence. I have had minor electrical since truck was almost new. I always carry a booster pack and it worked to start truck and get me home. Now for what my mechanic found after my last disaster. There is a high amperage fuse block located under your fuse box in the engine bay. There is 2 threaded studs for wires that feed your trucks electrical. Studs had never had ant nuts on them to hold the wires secure and after 14 years of total aggravation and fear of an accident or fire. I hope truck is fixed for good.  GM dealers would blow me off with any excuse why they couldn\u2019t find a problem. They wanted to sell batteries , Pcms  and ecms. The reason this becomes a safety problem is a chance of total power failing while in traffic being rear ended or worse. There really should be a recall for these trucks and checked.  I\u2019ve read hundreds of remarks from people with these same issues. I hope this helps. I am thankful to have a mechanic who  will research.",

WELL, SINCE THE TAG EXPIRED IN AUGUST 2016 IT HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED BY THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT AS A HAZARD DUE TO THE SAFETY RECALL.

I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGERS OF BOTH STANLEY AND LANDERS, AND THE LAST RESPONSE FROM LANDERS SERVICE MANAGER WAS THAT THERE WE \"NO PARTS YET.  NO PROSPECTS FOR WHEN THEY (REPLACEMENT AIR BAGS) MAY BE SHIPPED.\"  LET ME NOW BEGIN TO TELL YOU MY CONCERNS,  SINCE I RECEIVED MY ORIGINAL NOTICE FROM GM IN AUGUST, 2016, TAKATA HAS FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY ON JUNE 25, 2017.  THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP WHICH SOLD ME MY PICKUP TRUCK, HEITZ CHEVROLET, HAS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TWICE--TO DAVID STANLEY CHEVROLET, AND NOW, TO LANDERS CHEVROLET.  I AM BEGINNING TO THINK OF A CONSPIRACY.  DID TAKATA ADVISE GM OF A POTENTIAL PROBLEM THAT GM SUBSEQUENTLY ADVISED THEIR VARIOUS DEALERSHIPS OF REGARDING TAKATA AIR BAGS?  IF SO, THEN I AM VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN 1) TAKATA KNEW OF THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR AIR BAGS, 2) WHEN DID THEY FIRST NOTIFY THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS (SPECIFICALLY, GM) OF THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR AIR BAGS, 3) WHEN EXACTLY DID GM ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT FROM TAKATA ABOUT THE AIR BAG PROBLEM, 4) DID GM NOTIFY ITS DEALERSHIP OWNERS, EITHER SPECIFICALLY OR ON A BLANKET BASIS, OF THE PENDING PROBLEM WITH TAKATA AIR BAGS, AND 5) WHEN DID GM NOTIFY ITS DEALERSHIP AND DEALERSHIP OWNERS OF THE TAKATA MESS.  GM SAYS MY TRUCK IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  HOWEVER, IT IS JUST NOT SAFE TO WRECK.  I WANT THIS RESOLVED IN MY FAVOR--NOT WAITING FOR GM TO FILE BANKRUPTCY.",

THE REAL PROBLEM IS A LACK OF TOLERANCE IN THE PLASTIC MOUNTING POINTS WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW ANY ROOM FOR EXPANSION/CONTRACTION IN THE HEAT AND COLD.      HERE IS A LINK TO A FACEBOOK GROUP FOR OWNERS OF GM VEHICLES WITH THIS DEFECT WITH 5,700 MEMBERS AND COUNTING EVERY DAY WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU COULD EVER ASK FOR.

MANY OWNERS HAD THE BAD LIFTER REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, ONLY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFTER GO BAD.  I DECIDED TO HAVE THE DEALER REPLACE ALL MY LIFTERS, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY RECOMMENDED AND THEY ADMITTED THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE I WOULD BE BACK IN FOR THE SAME ISSUE ON THE OTHER LIFTERS IF I DIDN'T REPLACE THEM.  THE DEALER CONTACTED GM TO SEE IF ANY OF MY REPAIR COULD BE COVERED UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE 39,700 MILES ON IT, BUT MY TRUCK WAS 8 YEARS OLD SO THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T.  I CONTACT GM TO SEE IF I COULD DIRECTLY GET ANYTHING COVERED SEEING I ONLY HAD 39,700 MILES, PLUS BOUGHT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT JUST EXPIRED LAST YEAR.  I WAS TRANSFERRED THROUGH 5 DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES THAT ALL ADMITTED THAT THE LIFTER FAILURE IS \"AN ISSUE, BUT NOT A RECALL.\"  IF THEY KNOW ITS AN ISSUE, THE DEALERS KNOW ITS AN ISSUE, ITS A EXTREMELY COMMON ISSUE ALL ACROSS THE INTERNET, WHY WONT GM TAKE CARE OF IT?

I WENT TO THE DEALER WHO SOLD IT TO ME TO HAVE IT SERVICED & WAS TOLD THE RIGHT FRONT IMPACT SENSOR WAS CORRODED & HAD TO BE REPLACED. THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE, AND STATED TO DEALER THAT GM SHOULD COVER THE COST OF REPAIR. THE DEALER SAID NO & THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON RECORD.I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE COMMENTS PROVIDED UNDER ABOVE-REFERENCED COMPLIANT: \"I CALLED GM & WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE & THE SALT AIR IN MY AREA CAUSED THE CORROSION AND GM WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. I TOLD THE PERSON THAT I WAS TALKING TO THAT APPARENTLY GM MUST BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM IF THEY KNOW THAT THE SALT AIR CORRODES THE SENSORS. I MENTIONED THE FACT THAT SINCE THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT THE AIR BAG COULD POSSIBLE INFLATE WHILE DRIVING & CAUSE THE DRIVER TO SWERVE OFF THE ROAD OR INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE THUS CAUSING DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. I WAS THEN GIVEN A FILE NUMBER (71-1127296694) AND TOLD THE MATTER WOULD BE INVESTIGATED. I LATER RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM GM,SAID LOOKED INTO COMPLAINT & SINCE IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE GM WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRS. I THEN STATED TO HIM THAT I WAS AWARE THAT CHRYSLER RECENTLY HAD A RECALL OF VEHICLES TO BE REPAIRED BECAUSE THE AIRBAG SENSORS WERE CORRODING. I WAS TOLD THAT GM. HAD NO SUCH RECALL. MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THE CORRODED SENSORS COULD MALFUNCTION AND CAUSE THE AIR BAGS TO DEPLOY THUS CAUSING THE DRIVER TO SWERVE AND POTENTIALLY GET INTO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. CHRYSLER CORP. MUST HAVE REALIZED THIS BECAUSE THEY HAD A RECALL.\" THIS IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SITUATION. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. JHB  *TT",

I WAS THEN GIVEN A FILE NUMBER (71-1127296694) AND TOLD THE MATTER WOULD BE INVESTIGATED. I LATER RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM A G.M. REP. WHO SAID HE LOOKED INTO MY COMPLAINT AND SINCE IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE G.M. WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRS.

MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT OR ANY KIND OF INDICATION THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREVENT THIS.  THE FUEL LEVEL READ THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1/4 TO 1/2 TANK OF GAS BUT THE MECHANIC MEASURED 1/8 - 1/4.  I'M NOT SURE IF THE GAS LEVEL ATTRIBUTED TO THE SHUT DOWN OR NOT.  THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE WILL BE FACTORED IN TO YOUR INVESTIGATION.  I FEEL LIKE THIS WAS A DEFINITE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK UP AND TAKE ACTION.  MY SON WAS SPARED FROM INJURY OR DEATH AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM TO AVOID THESE IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.  WHETHER IT BE AN INDICATOR LIGHT OR BETTER YET REDESIGN OF THE SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY CANNOT SHUT DOWN THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY.  REMEMBER HE WAS DRIVING 60 MILES AND HOUR ON AN EXTREMELY BUSY HIGHWAY, THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN VERY GRIM, ESPECIALLY HAD IT OCCURRED AT NIGHT.

I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY RECALL OR SAFETY NOTICES ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I THINK GM AND THE DEALER MADE A MISTAKE AND DO NOT WANT TO CORRECT IT.

PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS. THE SAME TIRES ARE ON FORDS AND DODGES AND THEY DON'T SOFTWARE LIMIT THERE PERFORMANCE.

NO COLLISION OCCURRED, THEY JUST WENT OFF WHILE DRIVING ABOUT 60 MPH IN TRAFFIC. STASEK CHEVROLET DID A FINE JOB OF REPAIRING THE INTERIOR AND I RECEIVED MY VEHICLE BACK 3 WEEKS LATER. WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE MGR. WHY IT HAPPENED, HE STATED HE DID NOT KNOW. I ASKED IF IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND I GOT THE SAME ANSWER..\"I DON'T KNOW\". MY DILEMMA AT THIS POINT IS THAT MY PERSONAL SAFETY(AS WELL AS MY FAMILIES) MAY BE AT RISK WHILE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IN THE FUTURE. I SPOKE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AT GM CORPORATE AND THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE MATTER AND REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH ME. TOLD ME TO CONTACT A LAWYER. I CANT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY AT THIS TIME, OTHERWISE I WOULD PURSUE THAT ROUTE. I BELIEVE A PROPER RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH A NEW ONE OR PURCHASE IT BACK SO I COULD AFFORD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER TRUCK. GM DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME. I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON TO TRY AND GOUGE MONEY OUT OF THE SITUATION WITH SOME MASSIVE LAWSUIT. I'M NOT SEEKING ANY MONETARY COMPENSATION FROM GM. MY PERSONAL SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT, AND  I BELIEVE I DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE IN A FAIRLY NEW VEHICLE THAT ONLY HAS 19K MILES ON IT. ANY HELP WITH THIS ISSUE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. REGARDS, ERIC BAULER *TR",
