The dealer has my Audi A6 now for the 3rd time with the same issues.  They just told me that they saw a lane assist problem occur but did not give me details. - The vehicle is currently at the dealer for the 3rd time and they are talking with the manufacturer - Yes, plenty of warnings coming up and have started Jun 2021 at 1400 miles  I have kept track of when my car has given erroneous or real issues over the last few weeks.  When I bring the vehicle in today, 19 Oct 2021, it is the third time you will have it in for the same issues.   The car is scaring me because the safety issues are not safe and it seems as if the sensors are not working properly and seeing things that are not there and activating without any concerns to do so.    One of these times, the emergency assist came on when I was driving highway speeds and had both hands on the wheel going straight on a dry road and sunny skies (13 Oct), beeped at me 4-5 times with the message continuing to show on dash, the car jerked with the automatic brakes being pumped and no driver intervention as the seat belt was tightening on me, kept the emergency assist on to slow me down to the point that I almost got rear ended by the truck that was following me.  I was driving normally/straight on a straight road within the lines with both hands on the wheel and there was NO reason for the emergency assist to come on.  This is only one example of the car having a mind of it\u2019s own when it is not warranted.  I am afraid that the vehicle will CAUSE me to have an accident instead of protecting me from one.

When you pay a top price for a luxury car like Audi you expect that the care is built solid and not with cheap parts... it is very disappointing to see that a luxury car like Audi A6 will make these type of noises when the car is practically brand new.",
