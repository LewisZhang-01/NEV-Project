WOULD RUN A FEW BLOCK AND DIE.  ABOUT 4-5 TIMES.  WAITED UNTIL MONDAY WHEN DODGE DEALERSHIP OPENED, TOOK IT TO THEM.  THEY SAID A WIRE RUNNING TO THE FUEL PUMP RAN OVER THE TRANSMISSION, WOULD RUB AGAINST IT RUBBING IT BARE AND SHORT OUT THE FUEL PUMP.  THIS EVENT HAPPENED OUT IN THE BOONDOCKS ABOUT 15-20 MILES.  CELL PHONE DIED, FORTUNATELY A STATE PATROL/ SHERIFFS CAR HAPPENED BY AND WAS ABLE TO GET US A TOW TRUCK.  THIS WAS ON A SATURDAY LATE DAY.  WAS TOWED INTO THE NEAREST TOWN WHERE WAS ABLE TO GET A FUEL PUMP FROM A JOBBER ON SUNDAY, HAD AN INDEPENDENTS MECHANIC INSTALL IT, BUT STILL CAR WOULD NOT RUN RIGHT.  ON MONDAY HAD THE DODGE DEALERSHIP LOOK AT IT.  THEY SAID IT WAS THE WIRE LEADING TO THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH WAS RUBBED BARE AND SHORTING OUT.  THEY SAID A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED TO CUT THE WIRE, SHORTENED IT, SPLICE IT BACK TOGETHER AND TAPE IT UP AWAY FROM THE TRANSMISSION SO I DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN.  THIS SHOULD BE A VEHICLE RECALL I BELIEVE.  IN THE FAR SOUTH IT IS AN INCONVENIENCE, A NUISANCE   IN THE FRIGID NORTHLAND IT IS A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION IF YOU ARE CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN AT 20 BELOW ZERO WITH A 20 MPH WIND BLOWING AND THE CAR SUDDENLY DIES.    FORTUNATELY THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS ON A VACATION IN THE SOUTH AND NOT IN MY NATIVE NORTHLAND.  AND I DO SILL HAVE THE FUEL PUMP I REPLACED WHILE I WAS IN ARKANSAS.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF INFORMATION SITE AS THIS WERE MADE MORE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.
