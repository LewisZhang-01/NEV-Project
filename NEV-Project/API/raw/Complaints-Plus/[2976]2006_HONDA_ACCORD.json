At this time myself and the passenger are noticing a ringing in our ears. I myself have a tiny split in my lower lip. When the incident took place an individual came to the honda accord 2006 to ask if things were ok. The individual states, \"I heard a pop!!

AFTER A SHORT WAIT, I RESTARTED THE CAR AND PROCEEDED TO BACK OUT ONTO THE STREET, BUT THE SHAKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VERY PRONOUNCED  AND I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE DRIVEWAY. A CHECK OF THE FLUIDS REVEALED VERY LOW POWER STEERING FLUID, BELOW THE MINIMUM LEVEL MARK. AFTER TOPPING UP THE CHAMBER WITH NEW FLUID, THE CAR STARTED AND WAS OPERABLE WITHOUT  SHAKING AND NO STEERING PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, THE LEVEL IN THE CHAMBER SANK IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE MINIMUM LINE AFTER JUST A MINUTE OR TWO OF OPERATION (I BACKED A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE DRIVE). THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FRESH FLUID SPOTS ON THE DRIVE. MORE FLUID WAS ADDED AND THE CAR WAS SUCCESSFULLY DRIVEN TO THE DEALERSHIP LOCATED 2 MILES FROM OUR HOME, WHERE IT IS AWAITING REPAIR.  THE DEALER REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT BOTH THE HIGH PRESSURE LINE AND THE RETURN LINE WERE LEAKING. SINCE THE CAR WAS DRIVEN WITH NO PROBLEMS OR SIGNS OF LEAKS THE DAY BEFORE, AND BECAUSE THESE LEAKS APPEARED SUDDENLY, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR PROBLEMS WITH STEERING OR POWER STEERING FLUID LEVELS, WE BELIEVE THIS FAILURE POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS, AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD. THERE WAS ALSO THE POTENTIAL OF AN ENGINE FIRE DUE TO THE LEAKING FLUID. THE CAR HAS REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND VERY LOW MILEAGE (<30000 MILES). THE NHTSA ISSUED A RECALL IN 2012 (12V222000) FOR 2003-2007 ACCORD V6S. BECAUSE THAT RECALL WAS DUE TO DEFECTIVE LINES/HOSES, AND OUR CAR'S HOSES ALSO FAILED IN THE SAME WAY, WE BELIEVE THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO OTHER ACCORD ENGINE SIZES AND  VIN NUMBERS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED AND INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.",

I DROPPED THE CAR OFF THURSDAY MORNING AND LATER THEY CALLED AND SAID THEY FOUND SCRAPES UNDER THE CAR AND THAT THE COMPUTER RETURNED SRS CODES THAT INDICATED A COLLISION TOOK PLACE. I TOLD THEM THAT THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN TWO INCIDENTS WITH THE CAR, NEITHER OF WHICH REQUIRED ANY BODY WORK. WE RAN OVER A VERY DEEP POTHOLE IN 2006, WHICH REQUIRED THE RIM TO BE REPLACED. IN 2007 (OR POSSIBLY 08), I FELL INTO THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE QUARTER PANEL WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ROLLER BLADE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND DENTED IT.   BECAUSE THE SCRAPES THAT HE DESCRIBED SEEM TO HAVE BEEN IN THE EXACT SAME AREA AS WHERE WE HIT THE POTHOLE, I FIGURED THEY MUST HAVE COME FROM THAT. THEY TOLD ME THEIR ZONE MANAGER FROM HONDA AMERICA NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE FURTHER AND WOULD BE IN THE NEXT DAY (FRIDAY) AND THAT THEY WOULD CONTACT ME WITH THE RESULTS. ON FRIDAY, I SPOKE TO MY SERVICE ADVISOR AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THE ZONE MANAGER DENIED MY CLAIM DUE TO HIS BELIEF THAT A COLLISION HAD TAKEN PLACE AND BECAUSE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.   ON MONDAY, 2/3/2013, I CALLED HONDA OF LISLE AGAIN AND SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL SERVICE MANAGER, [XXX] . AFTER EXPLAINING MY SITUATION TO HIM, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO AND THAT COVERING THE EXPENSE IS UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ZONE MANAGER.

APPARENTLY MY MODEL IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE. I ONLY HAVE 87,358 MILES ON MY CAR AND HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CAR PROPERLY. I ALSO PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY 7 YEARS, 126K MILES WHEN I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE. THAT WARRANTY JUST EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2013 AND THE DEALER NOTIFIED ME THAT THIS REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. I AM CERTAIN THAT THE STEERING FLUID HAS BEEN LEAKING SINCE BEFORE MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED AS IT HAS LED TO THE DAMAGE OF THE ENTIRE RACK & PINION.

THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT WAS \"REPAIRING\" MY AIR CONDITIONER, SAID THE AIR WAS MUCH COOLER NOW BUT THAT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE COOLER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THAN THE DRIVER'S SIDE BECAUSE THERE IS A \"CHILLER\" ON THAT SIDE.  WHY IN THE HECK DON'T THEY HAVE A CHILLER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE TOO?!!  ALL AUTOMOBILES HAVE A DRIVER!  I JUST PICKED THE CAR UP AFTER PAYING $168.15 TO FIND IT IS NO BETTER THAN WHEN I TOOK IT IN.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY DID NOT COVER ANY OF THE REPAIR, WHICH WAS A VALVE REPLACEMENT ON THE LO SIDE, THE REPLACEMENT OF A HIGH SIDE SHREADER AND AN EVACUATE & RECHARGE.  FRUSTRATED, I CAME STRAIGHT HOME AND RESEARCHED MY CONCERNS ONLINE.  WHAT I FOUND WAS VERY CONCERNING AND IRRESPONSIBLE ON THE PART OF HONDA.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE WEBSITES WITH NEARLY IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS JUST LIKE MINE.  IT APPEARS THE CONDENSER IS NOT PROTECTED FROM ROAD DEBRIS AND CAN BE DAMAGED QUITE EASILY.  IF HONDA IS WELL AWARE OF THIS DESIGN FLAW THEY OWE IT TO THEIR BUYERS TO RECALL THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER THE REPAIR, BUT IF WE AS THE BUYERS PUT A GUARD/COVER OVER THE CONDENSER TO PROTECT IT THE WARRANTY IS VOID.  WE CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING.

THE TRANSMISSION POPPED OUT OF GEAR AND I WAS NEARLY REAR-ENDED BY A TRACTOR TRAILER (THAT WAS GOING TOO FAST). I HAD TO SWERVE OVER TO THE SHOULDER TO AVOID THE COLLISION. THIS POPPING OUT OF GEAR, AND DIFFICULTY SHIFTING INTO GEAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR THREE YEARS AND OCCURS 3 OR 4 TIMES A MONTH.  AFTER THIS NEAR MISS, I TOOK THE CAR INTO GET IT SERVICED (THIS WAS IN 2006). I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR THIS TRANSMISSION AND THAT THERE WAS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEM. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY CLOSE CALLS (AS BAD AS THE FIRST ONE) SINCE, BUT I HAVE LEARNED TO FORCE THE CAR INTO 3RD GEAR EVERY TIME. I HAVE ALSO HAD MY SHARE OF HORNS DIRECTED AT ME DUE TO DELAYED ACCELERATION. RECENTLY, I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH ON \"3 GEAR ACCORD 6 CYLINDER MANUAL\" AND ONE OF THE RESULTS WAS HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 08-020. THIS BULLETIN COVERS MY 06 ACCORD AND IS FOR \"TRANSMISSION GRINDS WHEN SHIFTING INTO 3RD GEAR, POPS OUT OF 3RD GEAR, OR IS HARD TO SHIFT INTO 3RD GEAR, NOTE: THESE SYMPTOMS CAN BE INTERMITTENT AND SOMETIMES MORE NOTICEABLE IN COLDER CLIMATES. FAULTY 3RD GEAR SYNCHRONIZER OR SHIFT SLEEVE\" SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE MY PROBLEM SO I WENT TO THE DEALER TODAY TO HAVE IT CORRECTED. THE DEALER WENT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM (IT CAN GO FOR OVER A WEEK WITHOUT SHOWING UP), HE SAID HONDA'S POLICY WAS UNLESS THEY COULD SEE THE PROBLEM HONDA WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE ANY REPAIRS TO BE MADE. SO HONDA HAS FOUND A PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRANSMISSION (THE ONE THAT ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE A COLLISION), RELEASED A SERVICE BULLETIN ON HOW TO FIX IT, BUT REFUSES TO DO ANY REPAIRS UNTIL THIS 3 OR 4 TIMES A MONTH INTERMITTENT PROBLEM STARTS TO FAIL OFTEN ENOUGH FOR IT TO FAIL WHILE THE DEALER IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR.

DURING FOG, RAIN AND NIGHT TIME DRIVING THESE VEHICLES WERE DRIVING WITH ONLY THE DAYTIME DRIVING LIGHTS ON.

HOWEVER, THE ONLY LIGHTS THAT ARE ON, ARE THE DAYTIME DRIVING LIGHTS, THERE ARE NO TAILLIGHTS, NO SIDEMARKER LIGHTS OR THE HEADLIGHTS THAT ARE ON.

APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND SCHEDULED A SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2006, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ROAD TESTED THE VEHICLE.  THE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE MY COMPLAINT.  ALL 4 WHEELS WERE REMOVED AND ALL 4 BRAKE PADS WERE INSPECTED.  THE FRONT PADS WERE AT 8.4 MM AND THE REAR PADS WERE AT 5.3 MM.  ALL FRONT AND REAR PADS WERE LUBED.  THE PROBLEM REMAINED UNRESOLVED. *JB",

        "summary": "WE EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM IN STOPPING AT A RED LIGHT ON OUR TRIP BACK FROM AN OUT OF TOWN TRIP LAST WEEKEND.  AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPERIENCE MY WIFE IS NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR.  AFTER A FEW HOURS OF HIGHWAY DRIVING, AND DECELERATING THROUGH AN EXIT RAMP, THEN RE-ACCELERATING AND ATTEMPTING TO STOP AT A STOP LIGHT WE EXPERIENCED AND AN EXTREMELY RESISTANT BRAKE PEDAL REQUIRING EXTREMELY HARD PEDAL PRESSURE AND THE ENGINE SEEMED TO CONTINUE TO REV DURING BRAKING.  WHILE STOPPED AT THE LIGHT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV ABNORMALLY.  OUR 30-YEAR-OLD SON WAS DRIVING.  HE DID NOT MOVE HIS FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL FOR FEAR OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.  HE SWITCHED INTO PARK AND THE ENGINE STOPPED REVVING.  WHILE KEEPING HIS FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL HE PUT THE CAR BACK IN DRIVE.  THEN THE ENGINE SEEMED NORMAL AND THE BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE RETURNED TO NORMAL.  THIS WAS A DISCONCERTING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT WAS ABNORMALLY DIFFICULT TO STOP, AND WE ALMOST RAN INTO A CAR IN FRONT OF US.  THERE WERE THREE ADULT WITNESSES TO THIS FRIGHTENING EPISODE, MY WIFE, OUR ADULT SON, AND ME.  WE DID NOT USE THE CRUISE CONTROL AT ANY TIME DURING THIS TRIP.    WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO OUR HONDA DEALER.  THEY EXAMINED THE CAR THOROUGHLY AND COULD FIND NO PROBLEMS.  THEY HYPOTHESIZED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A COMPUTER ERROR, BUT THE SYSTEMS TEST OUT FINE NOW.  NOW OUR FAMILY IS LEFT WITH A CAR THAT WE KNOW HAS A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT, AND WE DRIVE IT IN FEAR THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, HURTING OTHERS OR US.  WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS STEALTH DEFECT MAY BE LURKING TO HURT OTHERS IN OTHER 2006 HONDA ACCORD V6 CARS.  *JB",
