Because my part wasn't made a plant who decided to put out this bulletin, I am just screwed? Dealer had an Equinox in the shop at the same time as mine with the EXACT issue, his car was older than 2013 but his VIN was included. Clearly this is an issue and it isn't right to assume that maybe some parts were missed and can still have the issue even if they weren't made at a particular plant. I want an answer as to why they aren't willing to at least pay half when they are claiming some responsibility and just trying to tell me that my particular part has reached the end of it's life and nothing to do with the VIN's that are included in this adjustment. That is a poor excuse. I was dropping my daughter off at work when all this noise started happening and made it the couple blocks home. Now it has been sitting at the shop for 6 weeks while I have been trying to figure this out. Luckily my other daughter has a car I have been able to use for immediate needs but this is beyond ridiculous.

Thank goodness he swerved and we were able to partially be able to coast to the side of the road. As soon as we got to the shoulder and put the car in Park a HUGE puddle of oil gushed out of the car and it had to be towed. The excessive oil consumption that we were not aware of ( and we faithfully had our cars maintained, oil changed, etc) and destroyed the engine of our car. When I first started contacting GM,Chevrolet etc. I was told there was nothing wrong.  We put in over $6,000 in our 2013 equinox and would appreciate very much a reimbursement.  Thanks- Mp",

NOW, I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THE VEHICLE AND HAVE TO PAY A LOAN TO HAVE IT FIXED.  I AM, A SINGLE MOM OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD WITH AUTISM.  ALREADY STRUGGLING DURING THE PANDEMIC.

UPON TURNING OFF OF THE ROAD, MY ENGINE COMPLETELY SHUT OFF AND I LOST ALL ACCELERATION AND POWER FROM THE ENGINE. I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO FIND OIL ALL OVER THE BOTTOM OF FRAME OF MY VEHICLE. UPON GETTING TO MY OFFICE, I LOOKED UP WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE ISSUE. GM HAS PUBLISHED SERVICE BULLETIN 14882 THAT CLAIMS CERTAIN MODELS OF VEHICLES, INCLUDING THE 2013 EQUINOX, CAN EXPERIENCE A PLUGGED PCV ORIFICE ON VERY COLD DAYS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE BLOWOUT OF THE REAR MAIN OIL SEAL OF THE ENGINE. I HAD HOPED THIS WAS NOT MY ISSUE, BUT IT SEEMED TO FIT THE BILL. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A LOCAL GM SERVICE CENTER AND TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME TWO DAYS LATER TO INFORM ME THAT MY REAR MAIN OIL SEAL (CRANKSHAFT SEAL) HAD BLOWN AND THAT I HAD LOST OIL WHILE DRIVING. ALTHOUGH THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE BULLETIN MATCHED MY SITUATION PERFECTLY, GM CLAIMED THAT MY VIN DID NOT LINE UP. AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH MORE SERIOUS SITUATION IF IT HAD HAPPENED MINUTES EARLIER WHILE I WAS TRAVELING ON A 75MPH INTERSTATE, OR IF MY WIFE AND ONE YEAR OLD WERE IN THE VEHICLE.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO GET IT STARTED AGAIN AND MADE IT THE MAYBE 1000 FEET TO THE DEALER.  THE FIRST DIAGNOSIS THEY GAVE ME WAS A TIME CHAIN ISSUE ($1800) THEN THEY CALLED ME A DAY LATER AND SAID PISTONS/PISTON SEALS WERE ALSO AN ISSUE AND NOW IT WOULD BE ($2500).  I STARTED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND I FOUND THE LAWSUITS ABOUT THE PISTON ISSUES AND OIL CONSUMPTION. IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THE PROBLEM W/MY CAR.  I CAN DETAIL REGULAR OIL CHANGES AND NEVER HAD AN OIL LIGHT COME ON BUT I SEE WHERE OTHER PEOPLE DESCRIBE HOW THE SCREEN THAT GIVES THE OIL % IS NOT REALLY MONITORING THE CARS ACTUAL OIL USE.

A LITTLE WHILE LATER WE WERE CALLED BACK AND TOLD OUR VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE OIL CONSUMPTION.  WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH A SENIOR ADVISOR AT CHEVROLET WHO STATED TO US THAT THE CAR IS 6 YEARS OLD AND WOULD NOT LAST FOREVER.  WE THEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO THAT PERSON'S SUPERVISOR WHO TOLD US THAT GM CANNOT PUT VEHICLE VIN NUMBERS IN FOR RECALLS AND THAT THEY WORK WITH THE NHTSA TO DO THAT.

I CHECKED MY OIL (BECAUSE THESE VEHICLES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OIL CONSUMPTION) PRESSURIZED AIR BLEW OUT OF THE DIPSTICK, IT WAS ALSO 2 QUARTS LOW--I HAD JUST GOTTEN MY OIL CHANGED 4 WEEKS PRIOR. PUT SOME OIL IN AND DROVE. SAME ISSUE. STALLED AT BUSY INTERSECTION STOP. GOT TO MY DESTINATION TO DISCOVER A TRAIL OF OIL BEHIND MY VEHICLE. GOT IT TOWED TO DEALERSHIP. DIAGNOSED AS A BLOWN REAR MAIN SEAL DUE TO A FROZEN PCV VALVE. THIS IS A WELL-KNOWN ISSUE WITH EQUINOXES, ENOUGH THAT THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN (14882). MY EXPERIENCE/SYMPTOMS MATCH THE CONDITION DESCRIPTION OF THE BULLETIN TO A T, HOWEVER, FOR SOME REASON, MY VIN DOES NOT FALL UNDER COVERAGE FOR THIS ENGINEERING FLAW. CHEVY KNOWS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, YET THEY STILL REFUSE TO RECALL THE VEHICLES. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M STUCK PAYING AN $1800 BILL TO GET THE REAR MAIN SEAL FIXED--WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR THE PCV VALVE, CRANKCASE, OR OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM.

JUST AS I ROUNDED THE CORNER ON WHICH MY HOUSE IS THE LOW OIL PRESSURE MESSAGE CAME ON.  THE REAR MAIN SEAL HAD BLOWN OUT.  THIS CAR HAS 67,477 MILES.  IT WAS OUT OF  WARRANTY 11/25/18.  TWO MECHANICS SAID IT IS COMMON IN SEVERAL GM VEHICLES.  ONE SAID HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF CALLS HE GOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE OF THE BULLETIN HE WAS SENDING PEOPLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR COVERAGE UNDER A SPECIAL WARRANTY, HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN I TOLD HIM CHEVY WOULD NOT HELP ME SINCE MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED SINCE IT IS THE SAME VEHICLE, SAME ENGINE AS THOSE IN THE BULLETIN 14882, DOCUMENT ID 4098165.  MY DEALER SAID THAT HE ARGUED WITH GM THAT THESE ARE THE SAME CARS AND ENGINES BUT THEY WOULD GIVE NO ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID IT WAS A BAD DESIGN AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT IT.",

THE MOST RECENT FIX WAS ONE MONTH AFTER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY ENDED, AND THE REPAIRS WERE CLOSE TO $4,000.  THIS REPAIR INVOLVED REPLACING PISTONS/RINGS AND REPLACING THE TIMING CHAIN.  THE VERY NEXT DAY FOLLOWING THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR, I DROVE IT TO WORK AND IT STALLED 14 TIMES, DUE TO SLOWING/STOPPING OF RUSH-HOUR.  I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT MERGING ONTO THE HIGHWAY, BECAUSE OTHER DRIVERS ASSUMED I WAS \"MOVING WITH THE FLOW\" AND THEY DON'T STOP.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP... THEY HAVE MY CAR NOW AND SAID THEY WILL LOOK AT IT AND \"TRY SOMETHING ELSE\".  OVER SEVERAL FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS, THEY DID THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST, RESET THE TIMING CHAIN, AND A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS (IT WAS STILL UNDER THE 5-YR EXTENDED WARRANTY THEN).  I ASKED WHY THERE WAS NO RECALL?, AND THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE NONE OF THIS WAS SAFETY-RELATED.  HOW IS THIS NOT SAFETY ISSUE?!   AS I MENTIONED, THEY CURRENTLY HAVE MY VEHICLE, AND I FEAR WHAT THE REPAIRS WILL BE FOR ANOTHER ATTEMPT AS SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  I FEEL LIKE THE DEALERSHIP IS TRYING THEIR BEST, BUT PERHAPS THEIR HANDS ARE TIED.

I ASKED IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD CHECK.  I WAS CALLED THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD THEY WOULD ONLY COVER 30% BECAUSE I WAS 281 DAYS OUT OF WARRANTY AS OF 6/21/18.  THE ISSUE STARTED 150 DAYS PRIOR IN JANUARY.  THE CAR HAS ONLY 89,000 MILES ON IT.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH 2013'S.

THEN 2 DAYS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT TO GET MY CAR LOOKED AT MY CHECK ENGINE LIKE TURNED ON SO I PARKED IT AND DIDN'T DRIVE IT UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHEN I GOT THERE I LET THEM KNOW THAT THE LIGHT HAD JUST CAME ON. AFTER INSPECTING MY CAR THEY FOUND THAT THE EXHAUST CAMSHAFT ACTUATOR SOLENOID WAS OUT OF SPEC. THE REMOVED IT AND REPLACED IT AND FOUND A LOT OF METAL SHAVINGS ON THE ACTUATOR. R/R INTAKE SOLENOID AND AND CLEANED MORE METAL SHAVINGS OFF OF THAT. THEY CHECKED THE OIL AND THERE WAS NO OIL ON THE DIPSTICK, CAR IS NOT LEAKING OIL AND HAS BEEN REGULARLY MAINTAINED. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP CAME OUT AND TALKED WITH US AND SAID THAT WE NEED A FULL ENGINE REBUILD BECAUSE THESE CARS WILL START TO USE OIL AND THE TIMING CHAIN WEARS THE GUIDE OUT AT THEN THE CHAIN GETS WORN OUT AND IT RUINS THE ENTIRE ENGINE. THERE WAS NO INDICATORS OF ISSUES UNTIL THE ENGINE IS SHOT. THE DEALERSHIP AND GM SAID THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR 2010 - 2012 EUQINOX TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BUT BECAUSE MINE IS A YEAR NEWER (2013) THAT MY VEHICLE DOESN'T QUALIFY. NOT ONLY IS THE ENGINE TOTALLY SHOT AFTER 117,000 MILES AND 4 YEARS BUT THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD IS CRACKED RIGHT AT THE THE FRESH AIR INTAKE AND SO IT SUCKS EXHAUST RIGHT INTO THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE HEAT IS RUNNING. IT IS SO STRONG THAT THE WINDOWS HAVE TO BE ROLLED DOWN TO DRIVE IT. NOT SAFE!!! SUPER DANGEROUS TO BE FILLING THE CAB WITH CARBON MONOXIDE! NOT TO MENTION THE ENGINE IS TOTALLY SHOT DUE TO A DESIGNE FLAW AND COULD BREAK DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT ANYTIME.",

SHORTLY AFTER WIPERS FAILED FOR A SECOND TIME AGAIN DURING RAIN STORM WHILE DRIVING. TOOK VEHICLE TO LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD, THAT NO SOLUTION HAD BEEN APPROVED BY CHEVY AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR REPAIRS. ALSO IF THE REPAIRS THAT THEY SUGGESTED WERE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE CHEVY APPROVES THEN I WOULD NOT BE REIMBURSED. I DECLINED REPAIRS, AND TRIED CONTACTING CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE. AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS, BETWEEN CHEVY, CARMAX, AND LOCAL DEALERSHIP, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. CHEVY HAS SAID THAT I HAVE VOIDED RECALL BY HAVING CARMAX MECHANICS WORK ON IT. CARMAX TELLING ME THAT ITS CHEVY RESPONSIBILITY.

I HAD TO DRIVE 30 MINUTES TO WORK THIS WAY.  VERY SCARY!  AFTER WORK I TOOK IT TO HARDY CHEVROLET WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A BROKEN WIPER TRANSMISSION.
