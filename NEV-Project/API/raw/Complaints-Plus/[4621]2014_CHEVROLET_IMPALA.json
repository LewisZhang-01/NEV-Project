I took my car to a GM Dealer locally a diagnostic performed said it was wheel hub assembly (bearings). Due to cost of dealer labor I took car to my local mechanic at his private garage. He performed a diagnostic and confirmed the assembly should be replaced. The assembly was replaced at my cost and has since been replaced twice more as warranty replacement because the mechanic thought the assemblies may have been defective, this after only a couple thousand miles or so on the replaced assembly. Typically, it happens at low speed, and mostly when turning left. It becomes a problem when I'm driving in busy traffic and turning at an intersection because it will just lock up and not let me go, stopping me in the middle of the intersection subjecting me to the possibility of being crashed into by other drivers.

My 2014 Impala just had this issue occur on July 4, 2021, and when requesting GM to perform this repair at no cost for me (vehicle mileage is 77000 miles), GM stated that this extended warranty ended January 2021. This date does not match the 8 years called out in the letter they sent, as the general public couldn't even buy this vehicle until April 1, 2013 at the very earliest. GM refuses to pay for the fix of a known defect within a critical safety system on one of their vehicles due to a poor design. Conveniently, this issue occurred on my Impala ~1-2 months after the supposed end of coverage date, even though there is nothing documenting why this date was chosen or any data that supports that this issue will only occur inside of the quoted extended warranty window in the letter. GM needs to issue a recall on this rather than an extended warranty that doesn't cover a known defect within their design/manufacturing.",

Took it off and it was full of corrosion.  Reading online regarding reviews I find out that this is a very common problem with GM vehicles but GM refuses to do a recall.  However they did do a special offer to replace the sensor if you have less than 80,000 miles.  My car has 85,000 but I have dealt with this problem for several years.  I replaced the sensor myself (at a cost of $400) and now they tell me it has to be reprogrammed.  That really sucks.  It is too bad that GM just can't accept the fact that they have a faulty product.  I am currently waiting for a call back from the dealer to see what it cost to get sensors and wiring harness replaced (GM admits that there definitely was a problem and says you have to replace both sensors and the wiring harness).

THE ALERTS THEN SAID \"POWER STEERING DRIVE WITH CARE' & \"FRONT CAMERA' OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. THIS HAS HAPPENED VARIOUS TIMES SINCE ON CITY STREETS, ANOTHER MESSAGE I'VE SEEN HAS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT STABILITRAK. THE MOST RECENT EPISODE OCCURED ON 12/25/2017. I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET AND TURNED RIGHT AND THE STEERING WHEEL JAMMED AND THE RADIO WENT OUT AND THE SAME MESSAGES CAME UP, I TOOK A VIDEO THIS TIME SO THAT THE DEALERSHIP CAN SEE WHAT THE ISSUE IS. I FOUND THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON OTHER 2014 CHEVY IMPALAS FOR SIMILAR ISSUES WITH POWER STEERING BUT WHEN SEARCHING UNDER MY VIN NUMBER THERE IS NO RECALL ON MY CAR BUT I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS A MISTAKE AND MY CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE AND A BIG CONCERN TO ME AS I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND ALMOST CRASHED WHILE ON THE FREEWAY DUE TO THIS ISSUE.

OCTOBER 2016 I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SAME ISSUE BUT I ALSO NOTICED A SLIGHT TICKING NOISE. A MOTOR MOUNT WAS CHANGED BUT NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT THE SHIFTING ISSUE OR BAD SMELL. THEY STATED BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NOT GIVING ANY CODES, THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT. AUGUST 13 2017 AT 25 OR 30 MPH WHILE ACCELERATING THE CAR VIOLENTLY JERKED MY SON AND I FORWARD.

IT GOT TO 4500RPM WHEN I PULLED OVER AND SHUT THE CAR OFF. I TURNED IT BACK ON AFTER A FEW MINUTES BUT THE ISSUE CONTINUED. AFTER ANOTHER 5 MINUTES I GOT HOME. MONDAY 8/14 AFTER ARGUING WITH CHEVY ABOUT TOWING MY CAR SINCE THEY DIDNT WANT TO PICK IT UP UNTIL 8/17, THEY AGREED TO PICK IT UP THAT DAY 8/14. THEY ALSO STATED I WOULD GET A RENTAL AS LONG AS IT WAS DETERMINED THE ISSUE WAS A FAILURE ON BEHALF OF CHEVY AND NOT MYSELF. TUESDAY 8/15 CAME WITH NO UPDATE FROM THE DEALSERSHIP. WEDNESDAY MORNING 8/16 I CALLED FOR AN UPDATE AND WAS INFORMED THE CAR HAD \"INTERNAL ENGINE FAILURE\". THE SERVICE REP PAUL AT VALLEY CHEVROLET REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE CODE THE CAR WAS GIVING FOR THE INTERNAL ENGINE FAILURE. HE REFUSED TO GIVE ME A RENTAL BECAUSE THE CAR HAS OVER 36K MILES. I INFORMED HIM THIS IS CONFLICTING FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD ON 8/14 BY CUSTOMER SERVICE. HE SAID THAT IF I DID NOT WANT THE CAR FIXED, THAT HE COULD LEAVE MY CAR OUTSIDE.

NOTE THAT THE HEADLIGHT DESIGN IS UNUSUAL FOR A HALOGEN UNIT IN THAT IT USES A SHUTTER TO SWITCH BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW BEAM, A FEATURE MORE COMMONLY FOUND WITH HID LIGHTS. BY COMPARISON, OUR 2003 CHEVROLET MALIBU, WITH SEPARATE REFLECTOR BASED HALOGEN LOW AND HIGH BEAMS, DOES A MUCH BETTER (I BELIEVE MUCH SAFER) JOB OF ILLUMINATING A BROAD AREA IN FRONT OF AND TO SIDES IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.

I STARTED CHECKING EVERYWHERE AND FOUND THE CARPET IN THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT VERY WET.

THEY HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE THE UNDERLAY, AND IT STILL SMELLS BAD. THE DEALER SAYS THEY HAD A GM SERVICE SPECIALIST COME TO THE DEALER TO LOOK AT IT. THEY HAVE NO SOLUTION TO FIX THE WATER LEAKING OR TO GET THE MOLD OUT OF THE CAR. IT HAS NOW BEEN 6 WEEKS AND I DO NOT HAVE MY CAR!!

THE CRACK IS A SEMI-CIRCULAR LINE THAT HAS A SLIGHT DEPRESSION TO THE IMMEDIATE LEFT OF THE CRACK. I IMMEDIATELY DROVE IT TO THE HAWTHORNE CHEVROLET AND THE VERY NEXT DAY, THEY REPLACED THE STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG FOR ME. THIS PART INCLUDES THE \"RIGID\" BLACK SURFACE VINYL WHERE YOU ACTIVATE THE HORN. THE HORN TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO ACTIVATE TO MAKE A SOUND DUE TO THE RIGIDITY OF THE VINYL--WHERE THE HORN ICONS (I.E., THE RAISED \"TRUMPETS\") ARE IS EXTREMELY NON YIELDING--IN MY OPINION. I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AFTER THE REPLACEMENT AIR BAG WAS INSTALLED AND 1/10 OF A MILE AWAY, I NOTICED THE SLIGHT DEPRESSION AND LINE DEMARCATION ALREADY.
