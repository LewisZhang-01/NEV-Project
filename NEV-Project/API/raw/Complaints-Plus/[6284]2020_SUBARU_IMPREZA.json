That is when the key is turned on the engine did not immediately turn over but there began an increased hesitation overtime before engine would turn over.    It demonstrated issues of electrical problems.  Finally, on March 24, 2022 the engine failed to turn over and we had to have the car towed to the original Subaru dealer.  The tow truck driver attempted to turn the engine on but in his opinion, the starter was not working at all.  As of the writing of this report we do not know the exact cause of issue nor do we expect to pay for any repairs or parts since the vehicle is still under warranty.",
