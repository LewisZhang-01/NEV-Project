AND SEVERAL MONTHS LATER I HAD TO REPLACE A WATER PUMP.     AFTER OWNING MY VEHICLE FOR A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS AND WITH 2  YEARS REMAINING ON MY CONTRACT. AS I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE THE ENGINE JUST DIED AT A STOP LIGHT, WITH NO WARNING.     I WAS INFORMED BY THE BMW DEALERSHIP THAT MY ENGINE HAD FROZEN AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $21,000.00 DOLLARS. MY VEHICLE WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND MAINTAIN BY THE DEALERSHIP WERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE (ERHARD BMW, FARMINGTON HILLS, MI).       I INFORMED THEM THAT I SMELLED WIRES BURNING EACH TIME I TRIED TO STARTED MY STALLED VEHICLE. I THINK THE ENGINE FAILURE IS DUE TO AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE.
