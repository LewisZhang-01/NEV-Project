        "summary": "My daughter called me screaming when her 2005 Ford Ranger FX4 Level 2 had unexplained runaway throttle while driving back to college in January 2022.  The vehicle had the cruise control on for a couple hours and without warning, began to accelerate to the point that it was at the rev limiter, traveling at 90 miles an hour.  She called me hysterical and I advised her to shut off the cruise and hit the brakes but nothing would stop her or turn off the cruise.  I advised her to turn off the vehicle to ACC position and coast to the shoulder.  When she had calmed down, I asked her to restart the truck, it started wide open throttle, so she immediately shut it off.  I told my daughter then to mash the gas pedal a few times and restart the vehicle.  It restarted at normal idle speed.  1/28/2022- my daughter came home from school today for a visit, the same thing happened again on her drive home.  She was able to coast to the shoulder and restart after mashing the pedal a few times.  I am advising her not to use the cruise control and to get it into a Ford shop to inspect.  There are no lamps or warnings to indicate there is an issue or code/CEL.  This is a deadly situation that apparently has occurred with Ford Explorers that have the 4.0 Liter engine and 5.0L engine.  It appears from other forums (https://www.explorerforum.com/forums/threads/full-throttle-runaway-vehicle.442563/) that a throttle control cable may have an issue or defect that is causing the throttle spring to not release, or the cable is hanging up.  Please see included Explorer forum link above.",

I WAS IN CONTACT WITH A LOCAL FORD DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND AFTER THE REPAIR PARTS ARRIVED, I MADE A 2/15/16 APPOINTMENT FOR THE REPAIRS.  THE NAME OF THE DEALER THAT PERFORMED THE REPAIRS IS SUNSET FORD.  ON 2/15/16, THE REPAIR WAS MADE ON CUSTOMER NUMBER 71758, AND INVOICE NUMBER FOCS185790.  HOWEVER, AFTER THE REPAIR PARTS WERE INSTALLED, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT APPEARED ON THE DASH.  THIS HADN'T HAPPENED BEFORE THE REPAIR WAS DONE.  THEN THERE WERE E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND A FORD AGENT.  THE AGENT STATED THAT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED, AND EXPLAINED THAT A FUSE NEEDED TO BE REMOVED TO DE-POWER THE SYSTEM, AND THEN RETURNED.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TRIED, THERE WAS A BATTERY DISCONNECT, AND A FIX DIDN'T WORK.  A SWITCH, OR CIRCUIT, OR SOMETHING ELSE ISN'T WORKING.  THE COST TO FIX THE NEW FAILURE IS $253.99, AND FORD WON'T COVER IT.  I DECLINED PAY FOR THIS NEW FAILURE, AND LEFT THE DEALERSHIP WITH AN AIRBAG DASH LIGHT THAT INITIALLY BLINKS, AND THEN STAYS ON.  THIS VEHICLE MAY BE MORE UNSAFE TO DRIVE NOW, THAN IT WAS WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY TAKEN-IN FOR SAFETY REPAIRS!  1.  DID FORD PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING FOR REPAIRS ON RECALL 15S22?  2.  DID THE REPAIRS FOR 15S22 CREATE A FAILURE FOR SOMETHING ELSE?  3.  IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR REPAIRS, SUCH AS THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE CURRENT CONDITION THAT IS CAUSING THE DASH'S AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT TO GO ON?  4.  IS FORD DOING SOMETHING TO TRY TO CREATE EXTRA BUSINESS FOR ITS DEALERSHIPS THAT'S AT THE CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE?  5.  WHEN WILL FORD, OR THE DEALERSHIP SUNSET FORD, GET MY TRUCK'S WARRANTY-RELATED SAFETY DEFECT CORRECTED, AT NO EXPENSE TO ME?",

AFTER FIVE MINUTES, TRUCK STARTED AND DROVE HOME WITHOUT ANY FURTHER PROBLEM. CONTINUED TO HAVE SAME PROBLEM, DIDN'T MATTER WHAT SPEED I WAS DRIVING OR IF I WAS STOPPED AT A LIGHT, AND IT WOULD STOP REPEATEDLY IN ONE WEEK OR GO FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A PROBLEM. TRUCK WOULD STOP AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RESTART WITHIN A COUPLE MINUTES OR UP TO 30 MINUTES AFTER IT HAD STOPPED. I REPEATEDLY HAD TO COAST OR PUSH THIS TRUCK FROM THE ROADWAY WITHOUT ANY POWER STEERING. IN EARLY 2011, THE TRUCK STOPPED THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY. THE THIRD TIME, IT STOPPED IN FRONT OF FRIENDLY FORD, MONROE, MI. THEY KEPT IT FOR TWO WEEKS BUT IT ONLY STOPPED RUNNING FOR THEM ONE TIME AND IT REPAIRED ITSELF BEFORE THEY COULD FIND THE PROBLEM. IN MAY OF 2012, IT BEGAN STOPPING MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE DAY. IT STOPPED AND WOULD NOT RESTART AND I HAD IT TOWED TO CREST FORD IN FLAT ROCK, MI. THEY DISCOVERED THE FUEL SHUTOFF INERTIA SWITCH HAD FAILED AND REPLACED IT AND THE PIG TAIL WIRING HARNESS.  IT APPARENTLY HAD OVERHEATED FOR SOME TIME AND HAD MELTED THE WIRING HARNESS INTO THE SWITCH. I PAID $367.94 FOR THESE REPAIRS. AT THIS TIME THE TRUCK ONLY HAD 28,370 MILES ON IT. THE TRUCK WAS USED VERY LITTLE AND WAS ALWAYS KEPT INSIDE MY GARAGE. THE DEALER TOLD ME TO CONTACT FORD FOR POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT. FORD TOLD ME THEY DID NOT HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM AT THIS TIME BUT TO KEEP MY RECEIPT IN CASE OF A FUTURE RECALL. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM. THIS SWITCH IS DESIGNED TO SHUT OFF THE FUEL PUMP DURING A CRASH SO AS NOT TO FEED A FIRE. I GOOGLED FOR \"FORD RANGER DEFECTIVE INERTIA SWITCH,\" AND FOUND THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WHERE THEIR RANGER WOULD SUDDENLY STOP AND EVENTUALLY WOULD REQUIRE THE INERTIA SWITCH TO BE REPLACED AND IN SOME INSTANCES, IT WAS REPLACED AS MANY AS THREE TIMES DURING OWNERSHIP.  *JB  UPDATED 07/19/12",

THE 2005 FORD RANGER HAS HAD THE SAME ISSUES BUT WITH HARDWARE FAILURE OF THE SPRINGS AND TENSIONERS. BOTH SITUATIONS THE BRAKES FAILED AND ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE 2003 FORD RANGER, I WAS SHOWN THE SHOES BY A SERVICE TECHNICIAN AND TOLD THE BRAKES WOULD HAVE LASTED AT LEAST UNTIL 50,000 MILES BUT THE \"SALT\" FROM NY WINTERS EATS AWAY THE GLUE THAT HOLDS THE SHOE LININGS TO THE SHOE AND CAUSES IT TO SEPARATE. I WAS TOLD THAT THE DEALERSHIP CONTINUES TO HAVE SEVERAL ISSUES WITH FORD BRAKES ON ALL MODELS DUE TO THE WINTER SEASON. IN BOTH CASES, I HAD MY BRAKES SERVICED THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP AND PAID TO HAVE THEM \"CLEANED, INSPECTED, AND LUBRICATED\" PER THE SERVICE MANUAL.

IF THIS PROBLEM HAD HAPPENED DURING DRIVING, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH A VERY LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO REPLACE BRAKES THAT CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMS ON THIS MODEL.

USUALLY INERTIA SWITCHES ARE TO PREVENT FUEL FROM GETTING TO THE ENGINE WHEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.  OUR TRUCK WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AND JUST DIED.  THE DEALER JUST RESET THE SWITCH.  ON JUNE 28 OUR TRUCK DIED WHILE DRIVING.  DEALERSHIP DECIDED TO PUT A NEW INERTIA SWITCH IN.  ON AUGUST 29, 2005 OUR INERTIA SWITCH KEPT SWITCHING OFF. NOW WE HAVE A HISTORY OF THIS PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIPS PAPERWORK.  WAITED 3 DAYS UNTIL JULY 1, 2005 FOR A NEW INERTIA SWITCH.  REPLACED SWITCH.  ON AUGUST 23,2005 INERTIA SWITCH KEPT TURNING OFF AGAIN!  FURIOUS MY WIFE AND I CALLED THE MANAGER 10 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING AND ASKED WHERE THE LOCATION OF THE SWITCH IS SO WE COULD TURN OUR TRUCK ON AGAIN.  THEY TOLD US AND SAID TO CALL IN THE MORNING TO SET UP AN APPOINT TO REPLACE THE INERTIA SWITCH AGAIN.  A WEEK LATER THEY REPLACED THE PART AGAIN! WE TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SITUATION BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THIS TRUCK BRAND NEW FOR OUR SON TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL/WORK AND NOW WE WERE WORRIED FOR HIS SAFETY.  UNFORTUNATELY ON SEPTEMBER 9,2005 ARE FEARS CAME TRUE.  OUR SON WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE ENGINE DIED AND HE AVOIDED ANOTHER VEHICLE AND HIT THE CENTER DIVIDER GOING  AROUND 70 MPH.  OUR SON WAS INJURED AND NOW THIS TRUCK IS UNDER LITIGATION.  *JB ..UPDATED 10/22/12 *BF  UPDATED 10/22/12",
