WAS ABLE TO CHANGE LANES AND GET TO THE SHOULDER WITHOUT A CRASH.    I FEEL THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE.  IF THE FUEL GAUGE (WHICH IS FED DATA FROM A FAULTY FUEL STRIP) READS MORE FUEL THAN THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY HAS, IF THE ENGINE RUNS OUT OF FUEL AND STOPS, THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS IN PLACES WITH HIGH TRAFFIC COUNTS AND SPEED.  *TR",

THE SWITCH IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE MOTORCYCLE FROM BEING DRIVEN WITH THE SIDE STAND IN THE DOWN POSITION. THE SWITCH ON MY MACHINE FAILED WITH THE SIDE STAND IN THE UP POSITION AND THE MOTORCYCLE BEING DRIVEN DOWN THE ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH. WHEN THE SWITCH FAILED THE MOTOR STOPPED RUNNING, WHICH CAUSED THE REAR WHEEL TO SKID. I WAS ABLE TO PULL IN THE CLUTCH TO GET OUT OF THE REAR WHEEL SKID AND STEER THE MACHINE OFF THE ROAD. I WAS ABLE TO BY-PASS THE INTERLOCK SWITCH IN ORDER TO START THE MACHINE AND RIDE IT HOME. THE ONLY REPAIR WOULD BE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SWITCH. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT ONCE THE MACHINE IS IN GEAR AND MOVING DOWN THE ROAD THE FAILURE OF THIS SWITCH SHOULD NOT CAUSE THE MOTOR OF THE MOTORCYCLE TO STOP UNEXPECTEDLY. THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER COULD LEAD TO INJURY OR DEATH. IF THE SWITCH FAILS WHILE THE MACHINE IS BEING DRIVEN DOWN THE ROAD IT NEEDS TO ALERT THE RIDER OF A FAULT BUT NOT STOP THE MOTOR. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED TO ME AT 60 MPH I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILE THIS REPORT. *TR",
