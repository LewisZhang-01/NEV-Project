After a week of trying to get it fixed with no luck the vehicle began getting worse and wasn\u2019t able to go above 35 miles an hour. Finally the check engine light came on. Brought it into a local mechanic and a P 2820 J code was the issue. After researching online I found that Toyota had a service campaign for the same issues I was having. The problem is with the ECU and the cars solenoid. Currently trying to get it repaired but Toyota will not help since I\u2019m stationed overseas in europe and it\u2019s an American Toyota. Toyota USA has been little to no help with the issue so I have had to stop driving the vehicle since it\u2019s a safety hazard to my family.",

THE HEADRESTS, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE POSITIONED, HIT MY HEAD FIRST AND CAUSE IT TO TILT DOWNWARD WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SIT STRAIGHT CAUSING NECK PAIN WHILE DRIVING.    EVERY CAR I HAVE DRIVEN (THIS 2016 TOYOTA COROLLA INCLUDED) WHETHER IT BE A RENTAL OR TEST DRIVING A NEW CAR, HAS INDUCED NECK PAIN BY SIMPLY TRYING TO SIT PROPERLY IN THE SEAT. I DO NOT HAVE SUCH ISSUES WITH MY OLDER VEHICLES (2006 TOYOTA COROLLA AND 2004 HONDA ELEMENT) THE ONLY WAY TO ALLEVIATE THIS DISCOMFORT I HAVE FOUND IS PUT THE SEAT AT AN INCLINE SUCH THAT MY HEAD DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO TOUCHING THE HEADREST AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT SAFE.    PLEASE CONSIDER CHANGING OR MODIFYING THIS REGULATION. IT IS QUITE RIDICULOUS AND I HAVE MET MANY OTHERS WHO SHARE THE SAME PROBLEM.  *TR",

I BELIEVE THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE LED HEADLIGHT OPTION RUNS ALL DAY LONG, SO PEOPLE ASSUME THEIR LIGHTS ARE AUTOMATIC? THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AS SOMEONE ON THE ROAD AT NIGHT CANNOT SEE THESE TOYOTA COROLLA'S IN FRONT OF THEM WHEN THE TAILLIGHTS ARE OFF. IN TOTAL, I HAVE PROBABLY SEEN AT LEAST 40+ COROLLA'S WITHOUT THEIR LIGHTS ACTUALLY TURNED ON, BUT THE HEADLIGHTS ALWAYS SHINE.
