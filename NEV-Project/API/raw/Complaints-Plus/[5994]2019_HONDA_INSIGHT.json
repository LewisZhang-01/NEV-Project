The car was inspected by Howdy Honda and confirmed that the cable (harness) was routed incorrectly. Nobody else has inspected the vehicle. This incident occurred in may of 2021. Here are the words from [XXX], the Honda Agent that inspected the car:  Hello [XXX],     The problem with your vehicle is that the section of harness going from the floor to your seat was wrapped around a portion of the lower seat frame. Because the harness was wrapped and did not have it normal length of travel the seat could not move it's full length of travel. The reason that the seat restraint lights are on is because of the added tension on these wires from being wrapped up. some of the wires broke resulting in the warning indicators illuminating. This is a safety issue for several reasons. One you cannot adjust your seat to comfortably fit a driver of different sizes. Secondly with the warning indicators on for the supplemental restraint system, in the event of a collision, the airbags, seat restraints, and other safety features will not activate.
