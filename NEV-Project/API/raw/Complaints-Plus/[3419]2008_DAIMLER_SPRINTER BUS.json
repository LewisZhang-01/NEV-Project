SINCE THERE IS NO KNOWN DATE THAT THE PARTS WILL BE IN TO COMPLETE THE RECALL ON MY TAKATA DRIVER AND PASSENGER AIRBAGS, IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE AIRBAGS DEACTIVATED?  I DO NOT DESIRE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH A \"BOMB\" POINTED AT MY FACE, AND I AM A DILIGENT USER OF SEATBELT AND SHOULDER HARNESS SYSTEMS.  MY SPRINTER RV HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY, UNUSABLE SINCE THIS RECALL CAME OUT. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION.  *TR",
