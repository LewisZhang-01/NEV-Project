LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE COACH IN A BUSY EXIT LANE.  AFTER 4 HOURS (POLICE STAYED WITH US THE ENTIRE TIME)...WAS ABLE TO RESET ECM ERROR CODE AND START THE ENGINE. AFTER CONTACTING TIFFIN, THEY ADVISED TO DISCONNECT MOBILE EYE UNDER DASH. SPENT 1 HOUR UNDER DASH (WHILE IN TRAFFIC) TRYING TO FIND CONNECTION.  NEVER FOUND, BELIEVE IT IS NOT UNDER DASH, BUT UP AND BEHIND A KICK PANEL? LIMPED COACH HOME...WITH THE PROBLEM RECURRING 2 ADDITIONAL TIMES.  THIS A S MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM...IMAGINE THE PANIC OF AT 70 MPH THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING...AND YOU ONLY HAVE 60 SECONDS TO FIND A SAFE PLACE TO BRING 50,000 POUNDS OF COACH TO A SAFE STOP BEFORE LOOSING ALL POWER!  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED MULTIPLE TIMES BY OTHERS AS RECORDED IN THE TIFFIN NETWORK FORUM. THIS SHOULD BE A TIFFIN RECALL ACTION!*DT*JB",
