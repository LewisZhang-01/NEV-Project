ON 05-14-2005, MY 18 YEAR OLD SON COMPLETED HIS SHIFT AT WORK.  HE WENT OUT TO OUR 1994 DODGE DAKOTA PICKUP AND STARTED THE ENGINE.  AS HE DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL HE HEARD A METALLIC NOISE AS IF SOMETHING HAD BROKEN.  HE DROVE TO OUR NEARBY RESIDENCE AT VERY LOW SPEED.  THERE WAS NO COLLISION, BUT HE REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BRAKE PERFORMANCE.    AT OUR RESIDENCE, MY MECHANIC AND I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE.  I AM A 21-YEAR EXPERIENCED POLICE COLLISION INVESTIGATOR.  WE FOUND THAT THE LEFT (DRIVER SIDE) BOLT HOLDING THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER TO THE HYDRAULIC BRAKE BOOSTER PRESSURE ACCUMULATOR (AKA: HYDROBOOST) HAD BROKEN OFF.  THE BOLT APPEARS TO BE A LOW GRADE STUD THAT IS PRESSED INTO THE FORWARD COVER OF THE HYDROBOOST UNIT.  THE BOLT / STUD IS OF SMALL DIAMETER FOR SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT.  IT APPEARED TO BE OVER-TIGHTENED AT THE FACTORY (MOST LIKELY), OR WORE OUT DUE TO METAL FATIGUE (LESS LIKELY AS THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 51,000 MILES ON IT).    THERE IS A SECOND BOLT HOLDING THE MASTER CYLINDER TO THE HYDROBOOST.  THE SECOND BOLT HELD IN PLACE, ALLOWING REDUCED BRAKING ABILITY.  THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS FALLING DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT AT ABOUT A 35 DEGREE ANGLE.  HAD THIS DEFECT OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, OR WHEN PULLING A LOAD, A CATASTROPHIC COLLISION WOULD HAVE LIKELY OCCURRED.    THE TWO BOLTS APPEAR TO BE TOO SMALL IN DIAMETER FOR ANY VEHICLE, PARTICULARLY A LIGHT PICKUP TRUCK.  ALTHOUGH THIS VEHICLE IS A 1994 MODEL YEAR, IT IS STILL IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  I LIVE IN A SEMI-ARID AREA, SO THERE IS NO RUST.  THE VEHICLE HAS ALSO NEVER BEEN IN A COLLISION AND IS PARKED IN A GARAGE WHEN NOT IN USE.  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW AND HAVE BEEN THE ONLY OWNER.

HOWEVER, THERE WERE CURTAIN THINGS THAT HAD TO BE REPAIRED BY THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE DEALER ITEMS ONLY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THE LATCH ON  EACH SEATBACKS DOES NOT LOCK THE SEAT BACK, SO AS IF YOU HAD A SUDDEN STOP, THE SEATBACK COULD POSSIBLY ALLOW THE BACK TO TIP FORWARD ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE WHOLE SEAT ASSEMBLY TO MOVE FORWARD, CAUSING THE PERSON TO IMPACT THE DASH.  BOTH THE DRIVER SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE ARE THIS WAY. I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT RIGHT BECAUSE I HAVE LOOKED AT OTHER DODGE DAKOTA PICKUPS AND YOU HAVE TO PHYSICALLY MOVE THE LATCH UP TO UNLOCK THE SEATBACK SO THAT YOU THEN CAN MOVE THE WHOLE SEAT ASSEMBLY FORWARD. I HAVE BEEN TO THE DODGE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS MATTER ,AND THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED THIS WAY. THEY CHARGED THE DEALER I BOUGHT THE TRUCK FROM OVER $500.00 TO REPAIR ONE SEAT ASSEMBLY, AND IT STILL ISN'T RIGHT. I ASKED THE DEALER FOR THE MANUFACTURER'S CUSTOMER COMPLAINT PHONE NUMBER AND THEY DID GIVE ME A NUMBER, WHICH I CALLED. THE INDIVIDUAL TOOK DOWN THE INFORMATION AND THEN TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A MATTER THAT WAS BETWEEN ME AND THE DEALER TO RESOLVE. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY SITUATION AND SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OFF.
