IN MY RESEARCH I CAME UPON AN INTERESTING FACT THAT SEVERAL MAKES AND MODELS SEEM TO HAVE INTERMITTANT TURN SIGNAL FUNCTIONALITY AND HAZARD LIGHT ISSUES.  IN MY CASE MY 1995 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN (WHICH I LOVE MIND YOU) WAS BEING CHECKED FOR A TRAILER TO BE HOOKED UP.  WHEN THE PERSON PERFORMING THE INSPECTION ATTEMPTED TO TURN ON THE HAZARD LIGHTS IT CAUSED A MALFUNCTION WITH ALL OF MY TURN SIGNALS, BREAKS, HAZARDS(NO EQUIPMENT WAS ATTACHED TO THE TRUCK SO NO IT WASN'T A FAULTY CONNECTION TO THE TRAILER, THAT HAD NOT BEEN ATTACHED YET.)  AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF MESSING WITH SIGNALS AND PUSHING BUTTONS IT FINALLY RESET TO NORMAL.  THIS FUNNY WIRING PROBLEM OCCURS EVERY TIME I TRY TO TURN ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS.  UP TO THIS POINT I HAVE NOT HAD A NEED TO USE THEM BUT I AM AWARE THAT THEY WILL NOT WORK IF I ATTEMPT TO.  MY ADVISE TO ANYONE READING THIS IS IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR TURN SIGNALS MESS WITH THE HAZARD LIGHT BUTTON BEFORE YOU GO REPLACING FLASHERS AND BULBS.  IT TOOK SEVERAL TIMES OF PUSHING THE HAZARD BUTTON AND TURNING THE SIGNALS ON AND OFF BEFORE THEY STARTED TO WORK AGAIN.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH CHEVY THAT THIS ISSUE HAS NOT BE ADDRESS NOW THAT I AM FINDING IT TO SEEM SO COMMON A PROBLEM.  I WAS EVEN MORE DISAPOINTED TO LEARN THAT MY MALIBU HAS ISSUES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OTHERS WITH THAT MAKE AND MODEL AND THOSE ISSUES ARE IGNORED AS WELL.  A SIDE NOTE IF YOU READ MY OTHER COMPLAINT. THE 1996 CHEVY S10 MY SPOUSE AND I WERE GOING TO TRADE THE MALIBU FOR ALSO HAS FUEL ISSUES.  WHAT A BUMMER I USED TO REALLY LIKE CHEVY.

I HAVE NOTIFIED GM ON THEIR CUSTOMER ONLINE CENTER AND RECIEVED A COOKIE CUTTER RESPONSE THAT IT IS NOT A MANUFACTURER DEFECT, I NOTIFIED GM IN 2001 AND 2004 AND RECIEVED THE EXACT SAME EMAIL WORD FOR WORD. I WENT BACK TO MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AND TOLD HIM THE PROBLEM, HE TOOK PICTURES AND PROCEEDED TO WORK THE PROBLEM(APRIL 2004) THE RESPONSE FROM THE FACTORY IS THAT THEY WILL COVER 30% OF THE PAINT IF I HAVE THEM DO IT. I HAVE TWO ESTIMATES FROM REPUTABLE BODY SHOPS AT $2600-$3000. THAT MEANS I WOULD HAVE TO COVER ABOUT $2000 FOR A FACTORY DEFECT, BOTH BODY SHOPS DIAGNOSED THE PAINT PROBLEM AS DELAMINATION ( SEPERATION OF PAINT FROM PRIMER).
