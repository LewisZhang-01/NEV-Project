ON JUNE 1ST I WAS RUNNING AN ERRAND, GOT OUT OF MY VEHICLE RAN INTO THE MALL ONLY TO COME OUT 5 MINUTES LATER TO FIND MY CAR HAD ROLLED INTO THE BACK OF A 1994 CORVETTE.  WHEN APPROACHED BY THE CORVETTE OWNER HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME I LEFT MY CAR IN DRIVE.  I RESPONDED BY SAYING, NO, I HAVE MY KEYS IN MY HAND, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.  WHEN I LOOKED AT THE GEARSHIFT IT WAS IN DRIVE.  I KNOW THAT THIS IS PARTICALLY MY FAULT, HOWEVER, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TAKE MY KEY OUT OF THE IGINITION WITHOUT IN BEING IN PARK.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THE 2007 ECLIPSE WAS RECALLED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM.  WHEN I APPROACHED MITSUBISHI IN CALIF ABOUT THIS I WAS TOLD THAT'S WHAT I HAVE INSURANCE FOR AND TO TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO PROVE THERE WAS A DEFECT - EVEN THOUGH I HAD PHOTOS - UPON TAKING IT TO THE LOCAL DEALSHIP - I WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T HELP ME SINCE I DIDN'T PURCHASE MY VEHICLE WITH THEM.  THE DEALERSHIP ALSO TOLD ME IT'S POSSIBLE MY VEHICLE WAS WRECKED - I RAN A CARFAXS REPORT PROVING OTHERWISE.  I HAVE YET TO HEAR BACK FROM MITSUBISHI CORPORATE AND AM LOOKING INTO CONSULTING AN ATTORNEY.  ALL I WANT IS MY VEHICLE FIXED - ALL THE DEALERSHIP HAS TO DO IS CHECK THE IGNITION INTERLOCK CABLE AND REPLACE IT IF NECESSARY AND THEY WON'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT.  INSTEAD THEY WANT TO TAKE MY CAR APART TO SEE IF IT WAS PREVIOUSLY WRECKED BEFORE THEY WILL CONSIDER FIXING ANYTHING- AGAIN MY VEHICLE WASN'T WRECKED.  SO NOW WHEN I PARK I MAKE SURE MY E BRAKE IS ON AND I CHECK TO SEE IF I CAN REMOVE MY KEY AND 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES I CAN WHILE MY CAR IS STILL IN DRIVE.  SO IF ANYONE OUT THERE CAN OFFER ANY INFORMATION TO HELP ME PROCEED I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.",

UPON INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT MY TIMING BELT HAD BROKEN. MITSUBISHI REFUSED TO HONOR THE WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THE BELT BROKE DUE TO THE OIL SHIELD BEING MOVED DURING AN OIL CHANGE. THE OIL SHIELD IS NEXT TO THE TIMING BELT AND IT RUBBED AGAINST IT CAUSING THE BELT TO BREAK. I HAVE MADE COMPLAINTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WITH THE MITSUBISHI ORGANIZATION. THE SITUATION IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, BUT I HAVE A WONDERFUL AUTO INSURANCE SERVICE (AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIF AAA) AND THEY ARE REPAIRING MY CAR AND INVESTIGATING TO DETERMINE WHO IS REALLY AT FAULT AND THEY ARE GOING TO RECOVER THEIR FUNDS FROM THEM. IT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING TO KNOW THAT I DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, YET MISTUBISHI REFUSED TO HONOR A WARRANTY ON A CAR THAT I HAD ONLY HAD FOR 7 MONTHS AND THAT ONLY HAD 28000 MILES ON IT. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL BE TRADING IT IN AS SOON AS I GET IT BACK AND WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MITSUBISHI VEHICLE.*JB",
