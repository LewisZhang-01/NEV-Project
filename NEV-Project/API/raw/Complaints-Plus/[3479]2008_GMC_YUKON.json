This should never happen in a passenger car and the manufacturer should have better QUALITY CONTROL and prevent these defects from leaving the plants.  I have a MS in Mechanical Engineering and have knowledge of the tire designs, as we did research for Firestone in the 1980's at my university, and this is definitely a defect within a weak part of the fabric in the sidewall.  If you would like the tire for your investigation, please let me know ASAP. Other industries like the Medical and Pharma areas would not allow this kind of thing to happen and passenger vehicles with defective parts or components should never jeopardize any passenger to be in this kind of situation.

THEY HAD MY CAR FOR ALMOST 2 DAYS  JUST FOR A DIAGNOSSIC TEST 3. THEY DID NOT HAVE A HYBRID SPECIALIST THERE NOR DID THEY SENT IT TO ONE. THEY DIDNT FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT JUST SUGGESTED TO DO TRANSMISSION CHANGE, CHANGE THE WIRES TO THE SPARK PLUGS AND CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS AFTER DOING ALL THAT. THE PROBLEM CONTINUED. I THEN TOOK IT TO GMC PAID ANOTHER $150 FOR THEM TO DO A DIAGNOSIS TEST. THEY ALSO DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT SEEN THAT IT HAD A EXTENDED WARRANTY OF THE THROTTLES AND SAID THAT COULD BE IT. AFTER CHANGING THAT THE PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED.

I'VE BEEN HAVING THIS PROBLEM SINCE DAY ONE AND TOOK THE SUV TO MANY DEALERS BUT DEALERS COULD NOT VERIFY THE CONCERN UNTIL NOW. THE 2008 GMC YUKON XL DENALI WOULD STOP ACCELERATING FOR 2-3 SECONDS WHEN THE GAS PEDAL IS PRESSED. MOST OF THE TIME IT IS WHEN I AM TRYING TO PASS A LANE, TRYING TO ENTER HIGHWAY, TRYING TO CLIMB A MILD HILL OR TRYING TO AVOID A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT. AFTER THE DELAY, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD DOWN SHIFT AND I THINK IT DOWN SHIFTS TO EITHER 1ST OR 2ND GEAR CAUSING THE SUV TO ROAR LIKE CRAZY AND SHOOTS OUT LIKE A CANNON. I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE THE COPS GAVE ME A WARNING WITH THE LIGHTS AND SIREN PROBABLY THINKING THAT I WAS DRIVING RECKLESSLY. THERE WERE ALSO INCIDENTS WHERE I'VE HAD THE GAS PEDAL PRESSED DOWN ABOUT 80%-90% TRYING TO CLIMB A MILD ELEVATION AND EITHER THE ENGINE AND OR TRANSMISSION STARTED TO CHOKE. IT WAS SO BAD THAT THE DENALI ALMOST CAME TO A FULL STOP. YOU REALLY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS ON YOUR OWN TO UNDERSTAND HOW SCARY AND NERVE WRECKING IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE VEHICLES ABOUT TO RAM YOU FROM BEHIND BECAUSE THE SUV SIMPLY WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  MANY TIMES, I HAD TO SWERVE BACK IN TO ORIGINAL LANE IN FEAR OF CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. BECAUSE OF THIS, I DON'T EVEN LET MY WIFE DRIVE THE VEHICLE.   SERVICE MANAGER WAS KIND ENOUGH TO RESEARCH ON THIS MATTER AND FOUND BULLETIN #PIP4112J AND HE CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING. I'VE BEEN EXPLAINED THAT DUE TO LARGE POWER FROM THE ENGINE, HE HAS SEEN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLES BREAK APART.
