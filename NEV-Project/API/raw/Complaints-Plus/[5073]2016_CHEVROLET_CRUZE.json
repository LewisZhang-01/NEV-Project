The safety of my family is put at risk because: - The vehicle engine sputters while driving. - The engine leaks oil excessively, smokes, and lets off an oil burning odor. - The radio screen blanks out frequently.  All of the issues combined worry me because I have had the vehicle serviced multiple times and the safety issues still exist.   The vehicle was serviced by the manufacturer. The problems found were: engine concern for squeaking drive belt, front timing cover leaking oil, and camshaft cover leaking. The vehicle had special coverage warranties with the manufacturer for some of the parts that needed to be repaired.   There were not any warning lamps, messages, or indicators for the engine issues. I encountered the engine smoking, the vehicle sputtering, a strong odor of oil burning, and excessive oil leakage spots in my driveway. These issues made me take the vehicle in. The engine light did not light up for the issues. No indicator light(s) were on when the vehicle was taken in to be serviced.   The vehicle was serviced and the faulty parts were replaced. However, the same issues are present and have not subsided after being serviced, replaced, and or repaired. I worry that the engine issues for my vehicle can not be corrected and that select engine parts should be recalled.",
