The Ford dealer's Service Dept. stated the plastic pins that hold the plates become worn, and fail.  They said even in the oil changing process, they frequently have to replace the pins. This problem should be fairly easy to remedy by inserting metal female screw threaded receptacles into the areas the plastic pins fit into, and metal male threaded bolts to screw into them.",

I PLANNED ON GOING BACK TO THE DEALER SO THEY COULD CHECK IT OUT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I BECAME ILL, AND THEREFORE IT SLIPPED MY MIND. I WAS IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT AS SOON AS I FELT WELL ENOUGH I COULD NOT WAIT TO DRIVE MY NEW CAR AGAIN. MY FIRST TRIP WAS ACTUALLY TO MY ONCOLOGIST OFFICE, BUT I WAS EXCITED JUST TO BE DRIVING. ON MY WAY THERE, HOWEVER, MY CAR JERKED ME TO THE LEFT CAUSING ME TO RUN OFF THE ROAD. I WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY DOCTOR'S OFFICE, SO I PARKED AND WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS. WHEN I MY APPOINTMENT WAS OVER, AND I CAME BACK OUT I NOTICED I HAD A FLAT TIRE. IT REALLY SURPRISED ME, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I DID HAVE THE WEIRD INCIDENT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD CAUSE MY TIRE TO BLOW OUT. SO, I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED, AND LIFE WENT ON. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS STARTING MY CAR. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR THE FIRST TIME 11/19/19, MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER 1/20/21 WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I ADMIT, I DO NOT DRIVE MY CAR MUCH THESE DAYS, BUT I DO MAKE AN EFFORT TO START IT ALMOST EVERYDAY, AND LET RUN FOR 20 MINUTES. WHEN I PURCHASED THE ESCAPE, I WAS EXPECTING TO HAVE TO DRIVE TO THE MEDICAL ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH. I AM SURE EVERYONE IS DRIVING LESS BECAUSE OF THE CORONA VIRUS. I REALLY FEEL NERVOUS GOING OUT BECAUSE OF MY VEHICLE AND CORONA. I HAVE CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE MORE SINCE I BOUGHT THE 2019 ESCAPE, THAN MY OWN MOTHER. ONE LAST THING. I DID MENTION THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING THE FIRST TIME I HAD IT TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER, AND THEY SAID WHEN THEY TEST DROVE IT AFTER REPLACING THE BATTERY, IT DROVE FINE, BUT I RECORDED THE MILEAGE WHEN I WENT TO PICK IT UP, AND THE MILEAGE WAS THE SAME AS IT WAS WHEN I DROPPED IT OFF.",
