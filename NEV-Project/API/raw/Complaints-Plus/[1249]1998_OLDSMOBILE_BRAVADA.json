THE COSTLY REPLACEMENTS ARE JUST AS BAD -- SOME PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED FAILURES TWO OR THREE TIMES.    I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE NOT COVERED, EVEN UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I HAD PURCHASED.  IF IT IS AS BAD AS THEY SAY, AND IT SEEMS TO BE, THE VEHICLE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN SOLD TO ME WITHOUT BEING FIXED FIRST.
