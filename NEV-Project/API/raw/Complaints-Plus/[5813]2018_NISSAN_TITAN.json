Not sure if the traction control and ABS warning indicators are actually indicating that these systems are inoperative or not. These warnings stay on after switching back to 2WD mode, and are only extinguished after the engine is shut off and restarted. I believe the lack of 4WD can be considered a safety issue depending on the weather conditions and where the vehicle is located when this failure occurs.   Dealer confirmed issue, and is replacing the transfer case, under warranty.  I did a bit of research on an internet forum covering this vehicle, and found that others have had this same issue, and it has been identified as a broken shift fork in the transfer case.",
