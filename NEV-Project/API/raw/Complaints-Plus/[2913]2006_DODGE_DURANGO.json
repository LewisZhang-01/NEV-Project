As a former ase technician and auto center manager I have to say dodge has a mess on their hands. 1st off its ridiculous to stop the flow of technical information to the owners of chrysler vehicles due to globalization!? I have been working on this vehicle for months as my patience allows. All testing and troubleshooting place the issue back into electrical issues within these durangos. This is a dangerous problem so many people own older dodge & chrysler products affected by this transfer case problem, recall it and get it done! Now it has to go to a chrysler dealer to have the codes cleared by a dodge scanner. Issue with that is the local dodge dealer in the village i live is not known for honesty. I took my durango there when i had issues with security system. I was told it would need a $1000. computer to start, then maybe another $1000. I took it home put a security module in it, been driving it since. Hold Chrysler accountable, do something for these thousands of people who own nice looking nice running dodge products they can't drive due to transfer case issues, and its not just one issue, there are several issues & components in that system that are troublesome!!",

THE MECHANIC TOLD ME IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE 2004 THROUGH 2006 MODELS. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE. I SPOKE WITH DODGE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW AND I COULD PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT UPDATED COWL PART # 55362453AK THIS PART IS SUPPOSED TO DIVERT THE WATER AWAY FROM THE INTAKE. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT NO BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE PUBLIC. IN MY OPINION A VEHICLE THAT STALLS BECAUSE OF THE RAIN IS AN ISSUE. IT TYPICALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE VEHICLE HITS A 100000 MILES DUE TO THE WEATHER STRIPPING FAILING. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE ENGINES CAN BECOME WATERLOGGED AND THE ENGINE CAN BLOW A ROD THROUGH THE MOTOR WHEN TRYING TO START THE CAR AFTER THE RAIN.

I RESTARTED MY DURANGO, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON, BUT WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ISSUES.  THE SAME TYPE OF ISSUE HAPPENS SPORADICALLY, REGARDLESS OF WEATHER OR SPEED.  THERE ARE TIMES, AFTER SITTING AT A LIGHT OR STOP SIGN, WHEN YOU PRESS THE GAS TO GO THE GEARS ARE SLOW TO ENGAGE AND ACTUALLY START MOVING.  SOMETIMES THE DURANGO SHIFTS ROUGHLY AS YOU ACCELERATE OR DECELERATE.  AS TIME HAS GONE ON THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME MORE PERSISTENT.  I FINALLY TOOK MY DURANGO IN TO OUR MECHANIC AND HE REPLACED THE EGR VALVE AND THE THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR.  WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF THESE PARTS BEING REPLACED, MY DURANGO AGAIN BEGAN STALLING OUT.  I DID HAVE THE DURANGO STALL OUT TWICE, BACK TO BACK, LOSING ALL POWER IN THE VEHICLE, INCLUDING POWER STEERING.  I MANAGED TO GET HOME AND CALLED THE MECHANIC.  THIS TIME HE REPLACED THE THROTTLE CONTROL MODULE.  THE DURANGO IS STILL STALLING OUT AND SOMETIMES VERY SLOW TO ENGAGE GEARS WHEN STARTING OFF FROM A STOPPED POSITION.    THIS PROBLEM WAS SUPPOSEDLY ADDRESS IN THE 2004-2005 MODELS AND CORRECTED.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY DURANGO AS IT IS NOT RELIABLE; THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.

IT HAS STEADILY PROGRESSED TO WHERE EVERY TIME I TRY AND FILL MY TANK THE GAS PUMP WOULD CLICK OFF BUT THE GAS GUSHES OUT ONTO ME AND THE CAR AND THE PAVEMENT ? ANYWHERE FROM 2 TO 5 CUPS OF GAS. THE TANK ISN'T EVEN FULL WHEN IT DOES THIS. I HAVE HAD IT DO IT WHEN I HAVE ONLY PUMPED 1 GALLON INTO THE  TANK AND CONTINUE TO CLICK OFF EVERY COUPLE OF CENTS. IT TAKES AT LEAST 10 MINUTES TO PUT GAS IN MY TANK AND THEN IT ISN'T FULL.  IT DOES THIS NO MATTER WHAT GAS STATION I GO TO. I HAVE HAD THE TPS REPLACED 3 TIMES, THE FUEL PUMP TWICE......I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE INTER-RELATED. MY MINOR CONCERN IS THAT THIS WILL CAUSE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY FOR ME AS I HAVE ACUTE ASTHMA/BREATHING ISSUES.  THIS HAS CAUSED ASTHMA ATTACKS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL BUT MY FEAR IS ONE DAY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT.

WE WERE TOLD BY DODGE THAT IT WOULD BE @ $500.00 FIX (POWER WINDOW MOTOR/LABOR).  WE MANAGED TO GET GLASS UP AND LEFT IT ALONE. NOT LONG AFTER THIS, MY DRIVER WINDOW WAS BROKEN BY A ROCK AND REPLACED BY SAFELITE, JUST THE GLASS.  RECENTLY, THE DRIVER POWER WINDOW STARTED ACTING UP, FELL DOWN IN DOOR AND BROKE.  WHEN GLASS WAS REPLACED 2ND TIME, SAFELITE TOLD US THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: DODGE VEHICLES CAN ONLY BE REPLACED WITH DODGE GLASS AND THAT UP UNTIL @ 2 YEARS AGO, THE 2 BRACKETS HOLDING THE GLASS TO THE MOVABLE POWER ARM WAS A METAL BRACKET.  THIS METAL BRACKET HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED WITH A TYPE OF PLASTIC BRACKET ATTACHING TO MOVABLE POWER ARM.  HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM: OVER TIME, THE METAL BRACKETS RUST FROM MOISTURE (RAIN) LOSING ALL ADHESIVE IN IT THAT HOLDS GLASS IN PLACE.  ONCE ADHESIVE IS GONE, THE GLASS COMES OUT OF BRACKET AND DROPS INTO DOOR OR CAN FALL OUT.  EVEN IF GLASS DOES NOT BREAK, THERE IS NOT AN ADHESIVE AVAILABLE THAT ONE CAN TRY TO ADHERE TO GROOVE IN BRACKET TO SET GLASS IN. THEREFORE, THE CONSUMER IS FORCED TO PURCHASE A NEW GLASS THAT HAS NEW PLASTIC BRACKETS THAT ATTACH TO MOVABLE POWER ARM AND MAY BE ROOKED INTO PURCHASING NEW ARM/MOTOR.  NOW WE KNOW THAT PASSENGER WINDOW PROBLEM IS LACK OF BRACKET ADHESIVE, ARM/MOTOR WORK FINE. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, OUR 2003 RAM 1500 PICK-UP IS HAVING THESE SAME ISSUES WITH BOTH FRONT WINDOWS! REAR WINDOWS ON BOTH VEHICLES SEEM TO BE OK, BECAUSE THEY ARE USED MUCH LESS.  THE WINDOW MOTORS ON BOTH VEHICLES ARE FINE-IT IS THESE BRACKETS AND LACK OF ADHESION TO WINDOW GLASS THAT IS THE PROBLEM.  WE COULD POSSIBLY BE PAYING @ $1,500.00 TO FIX 3 FRONT WINDOWS ON OUR VEHICLES.

IF THIS VEHICLE SHIFTS INTO 4 WHEEL LOW AT 70 MPH ALL 4 WHEELS WILL COME TO A STOP AND THE DRIVER WILL MOST LIKELY LOOSE TOTAL CONTROL. AT THAT SPEED THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION. I HAVE READ OF THIS HAPPENING TO DURANGOS WITH SERIOUS DAMAGE AND HUGE EXPENSE FOR THE OWNER. THIS VERY SCENARIO HAPPENED TO A CO-WORKERS WIFE WITH HIS KIDS IN THEIR 06 DURANGO, LUCKILY SHE WAS ONLY TRAVELING AT ABOUT 30 TO 35 MPH AND NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED.        NOW MY KEY FOB WONT EVEN OPEN THE DOOR, IT ACTS AS IF ITS DEAD OR BROKEN. I HAVE TO USE THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE TRUCK MANUALLY WHICH SETS OFF THE ALARM EVERY TIME I UNLOCK THE DOOR. THE SAME ELECTRICAL PROBLEM I STARTED WITH IS TIED TO THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE ELECTRICALLY, ANOTHER COMMON CHRONIC PROBLEM.      MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER DENIES HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PROBLEM OR A FIX AND FROM WHAT I HAVE READ DODGE DENIES IT AS WELL. IS IT GOING TO TAKE A FAMILY'S DEATH FROM ONE OF THESE VEHICLES FOR DODGE TO OWN UP TO THIS AND RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE A VERY WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM OVER SEVERAL YEARS MANUFACTURING! *TR",

I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR IT START GURGLING IN THE TANK. I HAVE BEEN COVERED WITH GASOLINE ON A SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE FIRST FEW TIMES, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING I HAD DONE, OR THE GAS PUMP WHERE I WAS FILLING. BUT I RECENTLY WENT ON 2 TRIPS FROM FL TO NY AND BACK AND IT HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY FILL UP ON BOTH TRIPS WITHIN A MONTH, AS WELL AS FILL UPS IN BETWEEN AND AS I STATED, SOME PRIOR TO. THIS CREATED SEVERAL HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. GASOLINE ON MY PERSON AND CLOTHING, INHALATION OF THE FUMES CAUSING ILLNESS, GASOLINE ON MY VEHICLE, GASOLINE ON THE PAVEMENT AT THE GAS PUMPS. I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL POSTS ONLINE ABOUT MY EXACT PROBLEM SINCE IT HAPPENED. ONE PERSON IS PERSONALLY DOCUMENTING CASES. HE HAS OVER 120 + CASES HE IS AWARE OF, NOT INCLUDING MINE, THIS YEAR ALONE. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP I HAVE TAKEN AT THIS POINT, AS I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUE IF IT IS HAPPENING WITH SUCH FREQUENCY. THESE ARE THE DOCUMENTED CASES JUST THROUGH ONE PERSON ONLINE, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES NOT DOCUMENTED. NOT TO MENTION PEOPLE WHO DON'T FILL THEIR TANKS ALL THE WAY WHO MAY HAVE THE ISSUE AND DO NOT EVEN KNOW IT. DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO BE BURNED OR OTHERWISE INJURED, OVERCOME BY THE FUMES FIRST? HOW MANY INSTANCES MUST OCCUR BEFORE IT BECOMES A TRUE SAFETY CONCERN? DOES MY CHILD NEED TO FILL THE TANK AND MAYBE SWALLOW THE GASOLINE THAT SPURTS OUT?  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING IS IN THE WORKS. THE ONE INDIVIDUAL SAYS HE WAS INITIALLY LOOKING AT A $350 REPAIR BILL THAT WAS THEN LOWERED TO $100 AND THEN OFFERED FREE DUE TO HIS COMPLAINTS. I AGREE WITH HIM, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WANT TO PAY HIM OFF TO SHUT HIM UP. MEANWHILE THEY MAKE MONEY OFF WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AND I HAVE HAD MANY VEHICLES WITH MANY PROBLEMS. THIS ONE IS UNIQUE AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE.*KB",

AND STILL END UP SMELLING LIKE GASOLINE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL OVER THE GROUND, THE VEHICLE, THE HANDLE AND PUMP. I CALLED MY DEALER EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENS AND WAS TOLD THERE WASN'T A RECALL ON THIS SPILLING GAS PROBLEM AND IF EVERYTHING THAT WENT WRONG HAD A RECALL THEY WOULD MAKE NO MONEY.  DOES A FIRE HAVE TO START OR SOMEONE GET HURT OR DIE BEFORE DODGE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE AND ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY.  I HAD MY FUEL TANK REPLACED AND WAS TOLD \"THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT CAUSED FROM AGE, WEAR AND TEAR IT WAS A MANUFACTURE FAILURE.  THE TOTAL COST FOR THIS WAS $1,600.00.  CHANGED STATE FROM ALABAMA TO CALIFORNIA AT THE CONSUMERS REQUEST. 04/26/11     UPDATED 05/06/11 *BF",

THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY COMMON ON DURANGOS BETWEEN THE 2005-2007 YEARS. THE 2005 YEAR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A DEFECT FOR RECALL. WHY HAVEN'T THEY REALIZED ALL OF THE YEARS ARE?  *TR",

VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND WE HAD NO EXTENDED WARRANTY.  DEALER SAID THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT THEY HAD SEEN SEVERAL TIMES PREVIOUSLY, AND THAT DODGE HANDLES IT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  GIVEN THE NIGHTMARES REPORTED BY OTHER 2006 DURANGO OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, WE PAID THE $100 AND GOT A NEW TANK INSTALLED.  THE NEW TANK (AND FLAP VALVE) RESOLVED THE PROBLEM.  WE STILL BELIEVE THAT DODGE SHOULD HAVE COVERED THE ENTIRE REPAIR BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS AND THE SEVERITY OF THE SAFETY ISSUE, BUT A $100 LOSS IS BETTER THAN A $600 LOSS FOR OUR FAMILY.

I WENT ONLINE TO LOOK UP RECALLS AND FOUND THE 2005S WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM BUT THE 2006S DO NOT FALL UNDER THE RECALL.  I CALLED CHRYSLER/DODGE AND THEY AGREED TO PAY HALF OF THE 950.00 THAT IS WAS GOING TO COST TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  WE HAD TO SEND THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT AND WORK ORDER FROM THE DEALER WHICH WE DID.  THAT WAS BACK IN APRIL AND WE STILL HAVE YET TO BE REIMBURSED.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE INTERNET I FOUND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MYSELF.  THE GAS SHUTOFF VALVE CLICKS OFF BUT GASOLINE SPITS OUT ALL OVER ME, THE CAR, AND THE GROUND EVERY TIME I GO TO FILL IT.  IT HAS ALSO SPLASHED IN MY EYES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

I HAVE LOOKED ONLINE AND NOTICED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ESP ENGAGING ON TURNS FOR NO REASON. IT HAPPENS AT SPEEDS OF 5PMH, 20MPH AND ALL THE WAY UP TO 75MPH.     I SENT THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY KEPT IT FOR A WEEK AND A HALF AND RETURNED IT SAYING THAT THEY COULDN'T FIX IT AND WERE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY ITS DOING IT.     I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED AN ATTORNEY FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MANAGEMENT AND THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CORRECT THE ISSUES EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A WARRANTY AND THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE TO ME LIKE THIS 3 MONTHS AGO.     I WOULD APPRECIATE IF THIS ISSUE COULD BE LOOKED INTO, THANK YOU    WORRIED DODGE OWNER. *TR",

AFTER INITIAL 12/30/09 VISIT, EXPERIENCED POWER SHORTAGES MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE AUTOMOBILE RADIO.  MOSS BROS. DENIED ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS AND THEIR EFFORTS AT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  REFUSED TO HELP IN ANY WAY.  ALSO BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE TROUBLE WITH THE GAS TANK.  IT BEGAN TO OVERFLOW WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO FILL THE ENTIRE TANK.  TOO DISCOURAGED TO CHECK WITH MOSS BROS. AGAIN.  2.  THE MAIN FAILURE IS THAT GAS SPEWS FROM THE TANK IF IT IS FILLED COMPLETELY, ESPECIALLY IF THE GAS CLIP IS USED TO AUTOMATICALLY FILL IT.  THIS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES TO ME AND MY SPOUSE AT MULTIPLE GAS STATIONS.  WE NOW ONLY FILL OUR TANK A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE TO AVOID THE PROBLEM.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT BEING THIS CAREFUL ARE THAT GAS WILL SPILL OUT ON THE CAR, ON US, AND AT THE GAS PUMP.  AN ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SELL THIS CAR, BUT WILL NOW BE FORCED TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS SAFETY ISSUE BEFORE WE CAN DO SO.  3.  NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE AT THIS POINT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE KNEW IT WOULD BE COSTLY.

I TOOK THE DURANGO TO MY DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I HAVE TO ORDER A NEW FUEL TANK WHICH IS ABOUT $700.00 INSTALLED.  THE DEALER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO INFORMED ME THE FUEL TANKS WERE ON BACK ORDER DUE TO SO MANY BEING REPLACED.  *TW",

LOCAL MECHANIC SAID THAT COMPUTER WAS FRIED & COVERED UNDER EMISSIONS WARRANTY.  TOWED TO DODGE DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THERE WAS NOT A COMPUTER PROBLEM, JUST CAM SHAFT NEEDED REPLACING & RECALL ON INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER.  AFTER $450 REPAIR FOR CAM SHAFT & TOW, A WEEK LATER CAR STARTED HAVING ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  APROX EVERY OTHER TIME I WOULD START CAR, THE RADIO & ELECTRICAL DISPLAY (CLOCK) ON RADIO WOULD NOT WORK--APPEARED TO NOT GET POWER.  SIX WEEKS LATER, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  BY THIS TIME, ORIGINAL DODGE DEALERSHIP HAD BEEN CLOSED, SO WENT TO ANOTHER DODGE DEALER FOR SERVICE.  THEY FOUND ANOTHER WIRING PROBLEM WITH ENGINE.  COULD NOT IDENTIFY PROBLEM WITH AUDIO/CLOCK.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER.  THIS TIME LOCAL MECHANIC ADVISED IT WAS A FUEL PUMP PROBLEM.  REPLACED FUEL PUMP, CHECKED FUSE & STILL COULD NOT IDENTIFY PROBLEM WITH AUDIO/DISPLAY.  9 DAYS LATER WENT TO START CAR IN THE AM, AND ELECTRICAL SEEMED TO SPUTTER (LIGHTS, INSTRUMENT PANE, WIPERS, RADIO) BUT CAR WOULD NOT START.  STARTER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENGAGING THE ENGINE AT ALL.  DIAGNOSED AS STARTED MOTOR PROBLEM, STARTER MOTOR REPLACED, BUT CAR STILL NOT FIXED.

I HAVE TRIED MANY GAS STATIONS TO BE SURE THAT IT IS NOT THE PUMP AND HAVE VERIFIED THAT IT IS THE VEHICLE.  IN MY RESEARCH AND DISCUSSIONS WITH DODGE DEALERS, IT SEEMS THAT A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR 2005 MODELS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE, BUT THEY FAIL TO ISSUE ONE FOR THE 2006 MODEL.  I CALLED DAIMLERCHRYSLER AND THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THE MECHANIC SAYS THAT IT WILL COST ROUGHLY $800 TO HAVE THE FUEL TANK REPLACED AND GET THE PROBLEM FIXED.  I FIND THIS UNREASONABLE AS THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.  AS A FIREFIGHTER, I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH FUEL SPILLS AND THE DEFINITE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE FIRE AS A RESULT OF A SMALL FUEL SPILL SUCH AS THIS.  IN ADDITION TO THE DANGER OF FIRE THERE IS ALSO A POTENTIAL FOR ASPIRATION OF GASOLINE LIQUID OR FUMES AS A RESULT OF THE GASOLINE SPEWING OUT AT THE PERSON FILLING THE TANK.  THIS COULD CAUSE POTENTIAL DEATH IF IT OCCURRED.  I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD THE GASOLINE SPEW OUT AND GOT A DROP IN MY EYE, REQUIRING ME TO RUN TO THE BATHROOM AND FLUSH MY EYE OUT.

NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS AT A LOST OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPEN. SO I IMMEDIATELY STARTED SURF THE INTERNET TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BRAND OF VEHICLE. I DISCOVERED THAT THIS PARTICULAR SUV HAD AN INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER THAT WOULD OVERHEAT AND SOMETIMES IGNITE INTO FLAMES. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER CONSUMERS THAT HAD EXPERIENCED THEY'RE DODGE DURANGO'S BURNING TO GROUND, WHILE JUST SITTING IN THE GARAGE.  SO I THEN CONTACTED CHRYSLER TO PLEAD MY CASE. AT THIS TIME THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE RECALL, AND THAT MY VEHICLE WAS ONE OF THE VEHICLES IN QUESTION. THEN THEY AGREED TO SEND A LOCAL CONTRACTED INSPECTOR TO CHECK OUT MY VEHICLE. THE CONCLUSION OF HIS INSPECTION WAS THAT THE TRUCK BURNED THROUGH NO FAULT OF CHRYSLER'S DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVE THEM WRONG, OR HAVE IT INSPECTED MYSELF. MY INSURANCE HAD LAPSED AT THAT TIME, AND I KNOW THAT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. BUT NOW I AM STUCK WITH A TRUCK THAT IS NOT USABLE, AND THE COMPANY THAT FINANCED IT IS LOOKING FOR THEY'RE MONTHLY PAYMENT. WITH I CAN NOT AFFORD BECAUSE I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE TO GET BACK AND FORWARD TO WORK. SO I HAVE DONE A VOLUNTEER REPOSSESSION AND THEY WILL PICK THE TRUCK UP SOON. ONCE THEY GET IT I STILL WILL BE FORCED TO PAY FOR IT THROUGH GARNISHMENT, WHICH I CAN'T AFFORD.   IN THE OTHER CASES IN WHICH THIS SAME TRUCK BURNED TO THE GROUND, CHRYSLER DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT THEY'RE FAULT EVEN WITH SUCH A RECALL ON THEM.  VEHICLES DO NOT JUST BURN UP FOR NO REASON, SO PLEASE HELP DEAL WITH CHRYSLER. ALSO, I DID NOT RECEIVE A RECALL NOTICE UNTIL JUNE 16, 2008.

I HAVE CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER WITH THIS PROBLEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO RETURN THE CAR AS A LEMON WITH A SAFETY DEFECT.  THEY ARE RESEARCHING MY SITUATION.  I AM NOT SURE IF ANYONE ELSE IS HAVING THIS PROBLEM BUT JUST THIS LAST WEEK I HAD TO TAKE MY 63 YR OLD MOTHER TO A FUNERAL IN MISSISSIPPI AND GUESS WHAT THEY AIR BAGS SHUT DOWN AGAIN.  THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY AS I DO NOT FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST THIS CAR TO PROTECT ME IN AN ACCIDENT.  I ALSO DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE INCONVENIENCED WITH THIS VEHICLE ANY MORE. *TR",

THEY SAID THEY HAVE CONTACTED DODGE ABOUT REPLACING THE PLASTIC PIECE WITH MORE DURABLE MATERIAL TO NO AVAIL.
