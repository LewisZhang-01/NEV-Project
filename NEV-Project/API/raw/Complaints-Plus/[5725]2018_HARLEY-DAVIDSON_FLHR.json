        "summary": "THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE DRIVABILITY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE EXCESSIVE PRIMARY CASE FLUID.  WHILE IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET THE MOTORCYCLE WOULD SOMETIMES NOT SHIFT DOWN FROM 3RD-2ND OR FROM 2ND TO 1ST GEARS. THIS CAUSES PROBLEMS WHEN TURNING AND WANTING TO USE ENGINE BREAKING TO SLOW DOWN DURING THE TURN. I COULD NOT USE THE ENGINE BREAKING AND WOULD HAVE TO USE THE BRAKES QUICKLY AS TO NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. ALSO, WHEN SITTING STILL WITH ENGINE RUNNING IN NEUTRAL AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SOMETIMES NOT SHIFT FROM NEUTRAL TO 1ST GEAR. THE DELAY IN TRYING TO PROCEED CAUSES OTHER MOTORISTS TO ALMOST RUN INTO THE BACK OF MY MOTORCYCLE. THIS WAS MOST DANGEROUS WHEN TRAVELING IN A GROUP OF MOTORCYCLES RIDING CLOSE TOGETHER. ALSO, DURING AN EMERGENCY STOP CONDITION WHEN TRAVELING ON A CITY STREET ABOUT 50 MPH IN 5TH GEAR, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT GET OUT OF THE WAY FROM CARS OR TRUCKS BEHIND ME. THIS IS BECAUSE YOU MUST BE IN A LOWER GEAR THAN 3RD TO GET OUT OF THE WAY ONCE YOU HAVE COME CLOSE TO STOPPING. MOTORCYCLES CAN STOP MUCH QUICKER THAN CARS OR TRUCKS. IF I CAN'T GET OUT OF THE WAY, I COULD BE INJURED OR KILLED.  HARLEY-DAVIDSON TRIED TO FIX THIS ISSUE IN OCT '19. UNDER WARRANTY THEY ADDED A BREATHER KIT PART# 26500027. MY DRIVABILITY ISSUES STARTED ABOUT 6,000 MILES AFTER HARLEY-DAVIDSON SAID IT WAS FIXED. AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 6,000 MILES THE DRIVABILITY PROBLEMS STARTED. AT THAT TIME, I CHANGED THE PRIMARY FLUID AND FOUND 7 EXTRA OUNCES OF OIL. WHEN PUTTING IN THE CORRECT 30 OUNCES OF FLUID THE DRIVABILITY ISSUES STOPPED.  SEE ATTACHED TA0022 HARLEY-DAVIDSON KNOWS THE ISSUE. # DEAD?  THIS IS FROM PAGE 149 OF MY HARLEY-DAVIDSON OWNER'S MANUAL.  NOTICE: DO NOT OVERFILL THE PRIMARY CHAINCASE WITH LUBRICANT. OVERFILLING CAN CAUSE ROUGH CLUTCH ENGAGEMENT, INCOMPLETE DISENGAGEMENT, CLUTCH DRAG AND/OR DIFFICULTY IN FINDING NEUTRAL AT ENGINE IDLE.  *TR",
