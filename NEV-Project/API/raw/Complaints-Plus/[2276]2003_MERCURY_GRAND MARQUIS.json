        "summary": "I am the owner of a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis. Several weeks ago the power steering on the vehicle quit. This was not the result of the power steering pump. The linkage in the steering system had ceased, causing the vehicle to be dangerously unsteerable. I have had this repaired at a cost of $575 dollars. I believe this is a safety issue that need immediate investigation and a safety recall.  I contacted Ford Motor Company and was sent to Chat contact Shakura who gave me the Corporate runaround. We were lucky as this happened on a side road at low speed. If it had happened on an Interstate with speeds of 65 to 80 MPH I feel this could have resulted in a major accident. I should also point out this steering item is in Ford Crown Victorias and more than likely in Lincoln Continentals.  Please advise and contact me with questions.  Thank you in advance as this need to be resolved.",

IT ROCKS BACK AND FORTH IN THE UPSIDE DOWN POSITION.  ALSO.... AT TIMES IT FEELS HARD TO TURN THE WHEEL IN EITHER DIRECTION.  THIS PROBLEM APPARENTLY COMES FROM THE UPPER AND LOWER STEERING SHAFTS WHERE THE U-JOINT CONNECTS THE TWO STEERING SHAFTS.  IF I SLATHER GREASE ON THE SHAFTS AND WORK THE STEERING WHEEL BACK AND FORTH ABOUT 30 TIMES, THE \"TOUGH STEERING\" OR THE FEELING OF NO POWER STEERING SUBSIDES, BUT COMES BACK IN ANYWHERE FROM 1 WEEK TO A MONTH!  I CAN BE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AND ALL AT ONCE I CAN NOT CHANGE LANES, WHICH IS VERY SCARY AT TIMES!!! WHEN THIS HAPPENS AT 65 MPH IT IS ALMOST TIMPOSSIBLE TO STEER THE CAR!!!  IT IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS MAKING A TURN AT 10-20 MPH AS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE POWER STEERING QUITS WORKING AND I ALMOST RAM THE CAR SITTING AT THE STOP LIGHT BECAUSE THE CAR WON'T MAKE THE COMPLETE TURN!!! MANY TIMES, I HAVE HAD TO STOP DEAD TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE CAR AS I AM TRYING TO TURN RIGHT, AND THEN WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, CRANK AND MUSCLE THE STEERING WHEEL TO COMPLETE MY RIGHT TURN! ( AND I AM A 6', 245 LB. MAN IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE!!!) I HAD HEARD FROM OTHER GRAND MARQUIS OWNERS THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON EARLIER MODELS OF THE GRAND MARQUIS (2000-2002 MODELS) FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT FOR SOME REASON, THE 2003 GRAND MARQUIS LS MODEL WAS EXCLUDED FROM THIS RECALL!!!.  BOTH PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE LISTED APPARENTLY ORIGINATE FROM THE UPPER AND LOWER STEERING SHAFTS AND ARE COMPLETELY UNSAFE!!!  THERE IS NO WARNING AS TO WHEN THE STEERING PROBLEM PRESENTS ITSELF.  IN THE WINTER, HERE IN ILLINOIS, THE PROBLEM COMPOUNDS IMMENSELY!!!! THIS PROBLEM NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED!!! THANK YOU!",

SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH LCM FAILURE REPORTED BY MULTIPLE MARQUIS AND CROWN VICTORIA OWNERS AND FORD BULLETIN 14N01. CONTACTED FORD AND STATED WE NEVER RECEIVED 14N01 - FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE STATED THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE COPY OF 14N01 !? AND REFERRED TO DEALER. CONTACTED DEALER WHO STATED I WOULD NEED TO PHYSICALLY COME TO DEALERSHIP FOR A COPY OF 14N01, IF THE DEALER DIAGNOSED A 14N01 ISSUE, THE REPAIR WOULD TAKE TWO DAYS. I ASKED IF A LOANER WOULD BE PROVIDED. DEALER STATED NO AND DEALER STATED THEY COULD NOT ORDER THE PART AHEAD OF DIAGNOSING THE VEHICLE PER MY REQUEST TO EXPEDITE LCM REPLACEMENT. THE GRAND MARQUIS AND CROWN VICTORIA  2003-2005 SHOULD BE RECALLED. HAS ANYONE AT FORD EVER DRIVEN WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS? THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS A RECALL ISSUE, NOT A STEALTH FORD CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CAMPAIGN ATTEMPT AT PACIFYING CONSUMERS WITH NON WORKING HEADLIGHTS. THIS PROBLEM WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED IN 2008; WHY ARE CONSUMERS DRIVING CARS WITH MALFUNCTIONING HEADLIGHTS IN 2015? WHY DOES A FORD OWNER HAVE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF 14N01 ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE VERSUS FROM FORD VIA EMAIL? SO MUCH FOR THE \"GO FURTHER\" PROMISES OF FORD; WE CAR OWNERS AREN'T \"GOING FURTHER\" WITH NO HEADLIGHTS.",

HE FOUND THAT THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD NOT COME ON, AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THAT HOLDING THE HIGH BEAM SWITCH \"ON\", THE LIGHTS WORKED.  AT THE DEALERSHIP HE WAS TOLD THERE WAS LIKELY A RECALL TO FIX THIS.  SINCE HE HAS GONE BACK HOME, I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS FOR MY MOTHER.  I FOUND A CLOSED \"SAFETY\" ISSUE, NUMBER PE08066, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE EXPERIENCED.  ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE A VERY LOW NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS LISTED, CONSIDER THIS:  MOST OF THESE CARS ARE PURCHASED BY OLDER PEOPLE, MANY MECHANICALLY INCAPABLE IN ADDITION TO BEING UNSAVVY WITH COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET, AND TEND TO DRIVE IT LESS, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT, SO THE ISSUE WOULD NOT BE NOTICEABLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  IF THEY DID EXPERIENCE THIS, THEY PROBABLY PAID SOME SERIOUS MONEY TO FORD DEALERS TO GET IT FIXED, NOT REALIZING THAT THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE AND THIS SHOULD BE FIXED FOR FREE UNDER WARRANTY BEFORE FAILURE OF THE MODULE - THE TSB TALKS ABOUT FAILURE OF THE MODULE.  WELL, MY BROTHER TOOK IT IN FOR INSPECTION WITH THIS FAULTY MODULE, AND IT PASSED, SO THEN DO THEY NOT CONSIDER IT \"FAILED\"?  MOTHER IS 91 YEARS OLD AND WOULD PROBABLY PANIC IF THE LIGHTS WENT OUT WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING IT.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, AND SHOULD BE RATED HIGHER TO GET THE WARRANTY WORK DONE!!!  I PLAN TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SAME DEALER AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS.  MY SUSPICION IS THAT UNTIL IT FAILS SHE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS FIX, WHICH IS NOT CHEAP.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  LISTING MY INFORMATION INSTEAD OF HERS AS SHE NEEDS OUR HELP TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF ANNOYANCE.  *TR",

ONCE I STOPPED I CHECKED ALL OBVIOUS THINGS FOR FAILURE (BATTERY/FUSES/ETC) BUT SOON REALIZED I HAD PARKING LIGHTS/TURN SIGNALS/SIDE MARKER LIGHTS/DASH LIGHTS/TAIL LIGHTS/AND EVEN BRAKE LIGHTS...EVERYTHING EXCEPT HEADLIGHTS.  I TRIED THE HIGH-BEAM POSITION AND NO LUCK THERE EITHER - UNTIL I PULLED THE MULTI-FUNCTION SWITCH TOWARD THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE \"FLASH\" THE HIGH-BEAM POSITION.  I CONTINUED TO HOLD THE SWITCH IN THIS POSITION AND DRIVE WITH MY HIGH-BEAMS ON FOR THE FEW MILES I HAD LEFT TO MY DESTINATION.  ONCE HOME I TURNED VEHICLE OFF GATHERED MY TEST EQUIPMENT AND BEGAN MY TROUBLESHOOTING JUST TO FIND OUT THAT NOW EVERYTHING WORKED AS ADVERTISED.  THAT HELD TRUE FOR APPROX. 1500 MILES ' OR ABOUT 2 MONTHS (WITH INITIAL FAILURE AT APPROX 31,000 MILES) WHEN HEADLIGHTS FAILED AGAIN; AND NOW THEY EVEN FAIL INTERMITTENTLY AT ANY TIME TO INCLUDE DAYLIGHT HOURS.  MY TROUBLESHOOTING REVEALED THE LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE (LCM) IS THE CAUSE OF FAILURE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, MY INVESTIGATION REVEALED THIS IS A KNOWN FAILURE...BY LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE...TO INCLUDE YOU PEOPLE OF THE NHTSA.  MY ANALYSIS TELLS ME THAT THE FAILURE IS PROBABLY NOT MILES RELATED BUT MORE LIKELY USAGE RELATED SINCE MY 31+ YEARS (AND COUNTING) IN THE MILITARY TAUGHT ME TO DRIVE WITH MY HEADLIGHTS ON 24/7/365 IN THE SEE AND BE SEEN PHILOSOPHY'ADD THE FACT THAT I CURRENTLY HAVE 34,000 MILES WHERE MOST HAVE A LOT MORE. OPINION: A 3RD GRADER COULD HAVE DONE THE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AN 8TH GRADER COULD MAKE THE DECISION TO RECALL THE CARS FOR TOTAL HEADLIGHT FAILURE.

NOTHING GAVE WARNING TO THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING, WE BOUGHT THE CAR USED, AND WAS JUST FINE FOR A YEAR, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE DAY THE HEADLIGHTS JUST GO OUT. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO(3-1-10). NOW EVERYTIME IT IS DRIVEN WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON, IT IS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN AT LEAST ONCE AND SOMETIMES UP TO 5 TIMES JUST IN 3 MILES OF DRIVING ON MY WIFE'S WAY HOME FROM WORK. THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE LIGHTS BACK ON AFTER THEY GO OUT IS TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT THE CAR OFF, LET SIT FOR A FEW MIN, THEN START AND THEY WORK AGAIN FOR A BIT. THIS IS OVERALL VERY DANGEROUS AND SURPRISING THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT OR RECEIVED A TICKET YET!     I AM A ACTIVE MEMBER ON A CROWN VICTORIA FORUM, AND WITH LITTLE SEARCHING ON THAT SITE OR GOOGLE YOU WILL SEE TONS OF REPORTS OF THIS BEING A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THE 2003-2005 CROWN VICTORIA, GRAND MARQUIS, AND MERCURY MARAUDER. WITH THE HELP OF OTHER MEMBERS ON THAT FORUM IT WAS FOUND TO BE A FAULTY LCM(LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE) WHICH HAS A PROBLEM WITH OVERHEATING LIGHTING RELAYS. THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM IS TO PURCHASE A NEW LCM FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN $250 AND $600 WITH NO GUARANTEE HOW LONG THAT PART WILL LAST. I ACTUALLY PURCHASED A NEW ONE TODAY. VERY EXPENSIVE FIX JUST FOR THE USE OF HEADLIGHTS, BUT I VALUE MY FAMILIES SAFETY MORE. I WILL BE KEEPING MY OLD LCM TO POSSIBLY HAVE IT REPAIRED FOR WHEN MY NEW PART FAILS AGAIN.
