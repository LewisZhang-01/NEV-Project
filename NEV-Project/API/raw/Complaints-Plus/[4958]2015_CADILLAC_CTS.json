        "summary": "I purchased a Cadillac CTS 3.6, Performance Model, in late 2015 with Pirelli 245/40 R18 Pzero Run Flats as OEM tires.  I replaced those tires with the exact same Pzero tires in February, 2019, after 35,250 miles on the OEM tires.    I never had a problem with the OEM tires, and expected a similar driving experience and performance from the replacement Pzeros.  To my surprise, the experience from the new replacement tires was completely different from the originals.   I complained to the dealer on numerous occasions about the way the replacement tires rode and performed. I had the dealer re-check the front end alignment. I complained to the dealer that the tires lost air pressure to the extent of two psi per week. I complained to the dealer that the tires, as opposed to the driver, steered the car.  I was at the Cadillac dealership on December 31, 2021, for a typical oil change and asked the dealer to check the front end alignment.  At the time, the car had 48,458 miles on the odometer, and to my surprise, the dealer advised that there was no point in rotating and balancing the tires, or checking the alignment, because the wear on the tires was to the point of being dangerous to drive.  Thus with 12,923 miles on these replacement tires, they needed replacement.   I immediately complained to he tire dealer about the premature wear of the Pzero tires,  They examined the tires, and agreed that there was obviously a defect resulting in the premature wear, and would file a claim with Pirelli on my behalf.  I\u2019ve heard nothing from them to date. As evidenced by the above information, please consider this a claim on my behalf, for tire defects in the Pzero tires, causing dangerous driving conditions, and premature wear shortening the life of the tires. The remaining life of the Pzero tires, the mileage shortened by the defects, amounts to $xxx, prorated, and herewith being claimed. THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM A LETTER TO PIRELLI  N.A.

        "summary": "In about  mid November 2021 a grinding noise became noticeable from the rear of my car and quickly became louder. From experience, I thought it was probably bearing failure. The car was parked at that time and has not been driven since. Today is 12/20/21, so the car has been out of service for one and a half months at this point. An ASE certified mechanic inspected the vehicle and found the rear differential to be defective, it was identified as the obvious source of the noise and had metal particles in the fluid. Doing research I found that rear differential failure was common in Cadillac CTS's and a GM safety recall N192279370 had been issued with the bad units being replaced at \"no charge\". The Cadillac designated model in question is the CTS-V with the 3.6l twin turbo V6 engine. My car is a 2015 CTS with a 4L turbo engine. I haven't found a recall issued on this model and I don't understand why it hasn't been done. I feel that a differential failure in my vehicle would be just as dangerous as that in the designated recall vehicle, it's basically the same car with a different engine. The vehicle was inspected by one mechanic only, but his findings reveal an obvious fault. A review of the incidents with the designated vehicle involved show that very serious safety problem exists which would threaten the driver and passengers if this vehicle was put back in service. I expect that GM must recognize that this safety fault affects a wider range of their vehicles and it has to be included in their recall. I ask NTSHA to intercede.",

THE CUE SYSTEM WOULD BE OPERATIONAL  FOR A FEW SECONDS WHEN THE CAR IS FIRST STARTED AND THEN IT WOULD FREEZE OR LOCK UP.  WHEN THIS HAPPENED IT WOULD CHANGE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE CAR.  FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD; 1) PROGRAM CURRENT RADIO STATION ON ADDITIONAL PRESETS, 2) CHANGE PRESET DRIVER SETTINGS SUCH AS SEAT, STEERING WHEEL AND MIRROR LOCATIONS, ETC., 3) TURN OFF AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT FUNCTIONS, 4) TURN OFF AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKING FUNCTIONS.  BASICALLY ANY FUNCTION OF THE VEHICLE THAT CAN BE CHANGED AS A USER FUNCTION THRU THE CUE SYSTEM, NOW IS SUBJECT TO BE CHANGED RANDOMLY WHILE THE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN.  MOST OF THESE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE RANDOMLY CHANGED CANNOT BE ACCESSED EXCEPT THRU THE CUE SYSTEM.  THUS I NO LONGER HAVE CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.
