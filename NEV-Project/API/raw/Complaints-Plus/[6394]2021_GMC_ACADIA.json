In winter weather conditions the storage compartment at the base of the windshield fills up with snow, even when driving. The wiper blades eventually end up resting on this snow. When wipers are turned on there is a  quite often a build up of ice on the wiper blades. This causes the wiper blades to raise above windshield and not clean the windshield (partially or completely)  Generally you need to stop and break/snow or ice from the wiper as you can not see.   Same occurs when e get a freezing rain  ice builds up at base of windshield then eventually ices up the wiper blades and not cleaning the windshield. The vehicle is not designed to handle winter and freezing rain conditions, after building vehicles for many years we should have a better wiper system. --Blades should have electric heat wires in them,   --maybe need completely electric windshield to handle snow/ice cond. -- The placement of the defroster vents are very poorly placed, they should be all across the base of the windshield. A couple of days ago we had freezing rain,  blades were freezing up, heater defroster was at max heat, and fan was at max, I had to constantly pull over and scrape ice off.  This is very dangerous situation be it ice or snow. Design engineers really don't seem to take the winter conditions into consideration in the design of vehicles. I have driven over 5 million kms during my career and used to dealing with many types of conditions. No accidents . Just want to bring these issue to your attention. I am extremely disappointed in this unit because of this. Thanks [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

        "summary": "As I was driving down Interstate 65 in south Alabama on a drizzling rainy day, the sunroof made a very loud popping noise and then exploded, with shattered glass falling into my SUV.  Luckily, I was able to keep my vehicle on the road without swerving and losing control.  I closed the sunshade on the sunroof to keep the glass from continuing to fall in and drove home.  There was no warning lights nor any indication that something was wrong with the sunroof.  When I got home, I called the nearest GMC dealership in Pensacola, Florida to report the issue (850.637.8973).  Jonathan Sparks handled the claim.  He sent out team members to pick up the vehicle from my home.  They first removed as much of the glass as they could to keep it from flying off and possibly hitting another vehicle behind them.  They drove it to Pensacola, replaced the entire sunroof, and then brought it back to me.  Documentation and pictures are attached.",
