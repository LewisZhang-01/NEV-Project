I was on the speed limit of 15-20 miles/hour and there were no vehicles behind my car otherwise it would be a major accident.

Earlier to this incident, good no of times, my vehicle was forecasting the warning messages on Dashboard though nothing was there, I thought may be sensor is covering the objects with broader angle but suddenly stopping the vehicle for the first time.  As Honda is providing the major safety features, I was purchased this CR-V particularly and thinking I am safe on long drives, but this incident is changed my mindset and now worrying in future if it happens what to do?

No car was immediately behind me or they would  have crashed into me.  My purse, coffee and book on front seat went flying to the dashboard.   Prior to this event happening, the Brake warning light would go off even if no one was in front of me or anywhere around me.  the Honda dealership in Freehold NJ dismissed my concern and said there is nothing they can do without recreating the problem.  I called the Freehold dealership and was told the service manager was out for a month, no one is covering for him.  I asked to speak to someone else in the service department and they told me to drive down and they will have a technician drive with me to see the problem.  I told them it was random and never happened before, but to no avail.   I asked if I could turn off the Collusion Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) and they said no.  Just to adjust the ACC (low speed follow) to long.  I insisted on being seen today, but am concerned that this will happen again.",

I could have easily been rear-ended by the car behind me because there was a long line of cars waiting along with me.

I felt even more unsafe driving the car back through the same area. It did not happen again upon my return as I went over the tracks.   The problem has not happened again because I now know how to turn off the CMBS system every single time I get into the car. I do not want to chance going even a bit faster or being on the freeway and having the car come to a sudden halt. There would most certainly be grave injuries at freeway speeds on such crowded L.A. freeways. I am so afraid of this happening that I must drive without the CMBS from now on.

They drove my car to test it but nothing happened.

I put my foot on the brake and slowed while I scanned for any obstacles, but there weren't any. The second event was in December 2021 and occurred on a city street in Arlington, TX. Again, my vehicle braked suddenly while there was nothing close enough to account for needing a hard braking. Fortunately in both cases I was alert and managed to press down on the brake to override and then accelerate, and thus prevented being rear-ended by another car.

She was able to get to the side of the interstate and called me. She said all the lights on the display were showing as failed systems.  Internet search lead me to believe it was the battery.  On arrival i installed new battery but symptoms remained car would not start and just shuddered when attempting to start.  I called the dealership we purchased from to talk to a tech.  I was asked if she was low on gas below 1/2 tank. Yes the gauge shows 1/4 tank remains.  I was told to get gas and it should be fine, some of the CRV's run out of gas but read that gas remains.  I did get gas and car cranked we drove home.  At 63 we don't need this kind of dangerous situation to happen.  Think how easily this could have gone from bad to worse.  She did call the state patrol and asked for the roadside assistance truck to come.  This would at least have some flashing lights.  They never made it. The dealership told me on the phone that this was not a recall or covered but they knew about it occurring.  They would be glad to fix it at my expense.  Money for maintenance is one thing but I might as well let my wife drive a junker if this is what I get when I buy a Honda.  This occurred 02/16/22 so I have not been to the dealer for their evaluation, just to the gas station.",

During the fall/winter of 2018, the warning lights and bells came on for apparently no reason and the vehicle would barely move down the road. Turning off the vehicle and restarting it fixed the issue with the vehicle moving however the lights remained on. I took the vehicle in to be checked by the dealer at least twice, but they were unable to find any problem. At this time the only possible solution that I found from searching the problem on google was a possible loose battery connection or low voltage in batter. They reset the computer and it has continued to occur multiple times since then. Once again on Friday, February 4, 2022, I took the vehicle in for a service with the warning lights all on again. They fixed some extended warranty issues which they thought fixed the problem. However, within less than 5 minutes after starting the vehicle all the lights were on again. At this time, I again did a google search for this issue and now I am finding that 4 years later with hundreds of people continuing to have the same problem repeatedly the fix that seems to be the actual solution is to replace the fuel injectors. Yet, Honda is refusing to recognize this as their problem and forcing their customers to foot the bill for this repair that has obviously been an issue since the vehicle was purchased. When all the warning lights are on none of the vehicle safety features work and all the flashing lights and dinging bells are a major driver distraction. Nevermind when start your car and attempt to pull onto the road and the vehicle will not run over 5 miles an hour with the gas pedal to the floor. I had to pull over on the side of the road which was not wide enough for me to get out of the road and turn off my ignition and restart my car. Thankfully it would accelerate at a normal speed afterwards and I was able to get home safely.",

Three days later upon starting the car all of the same lights and warnings came on.  This time I was able to back up with no issues.  I went straight to the dealer and asked them to do an ECU check.  They said it could be the fuel injectors; however could not guarantee that would solve the problem with all the lights coming on.  Had the car all day and came back with about 7 codes.  I had to ask what the codes were as they had not been written down on my statement.  I wrote them down and looked them up that night.  Two of them were under warranty.  The mechanic did not know the two codes were under warranty and did not look into it further.    I took the car in for the third time and had the codes updated and checked.  One was for the injectors which they said failed.  The other was a check for spark plugs, etc. to help eliminate the source of problem.

My battery died several times while still under warranty but the dealer said this is NORMAL for it to die after sitting for a week and some / many die after 3 days!! I feel this is VERY dangerous! What if it dies after say a trip and you're off site parked in a bad area? Or in bad weather? They did not replace and of course as soon as the warranty ran out it died for good and I had to replace it. I feel this should be looked into as a serious problem.  Jim  PS - I had reported a problem w/ the collision system a year or two ago....it's still fluky. Just this week it auto slammed on the brakes when I truck was on a bend in front of me so it thought I was going to hit him?? Then it happened on an Interstate! A vehicle coming on via the onramp triggered it at 70 MPH! Not a slam though but scary.",

Speaking with Service Advisors at the dealership this is a manufacturing issue with other models, but not with this model.  Research on the internet and Honda forums indicates this is a KNOWN ISSUE which Honda REFUSES to make right. Instead consumers are forced to pay outrageous repair fees and usually only at their dealerships due to the specialty of the parts involved.

Could not restart the car at all, and check engine lights were lit on the dashboard. After 5 minutes passed and after multiple tries to restart the car, the engine started and I was able to get to safety.  Upon dealer inspection, the cause was the air condition compressor locking up, possibly due to a leak in the refrigerant. This is confirmed by the car blowing hot air even in AC mode. The lock up caused the engine to stall and go into fail safe mode. This meant the car was stopped and unable to restart in the middle of a busy intersection.  Because the car's engine was stopped, it was not possible to get the car moving again. It was incredibly dangerous for me and my passengers, as well as other cars on the road. Even when the lights changed, I was still stuck. There were cars driving around my car, causing more potential traffic incidents. The engine was not able to be immediately restarted, which put multiple cars in traffic in danger for longer than necessary.  The car is being serviced by Roush Honda (100 W Schrock Rd, Westerville, OH 43081).  Prior to the failure, there were no warning signs and no other issues. This was a sudden and completely unexpected engine stall due to the AC Compressor Failure.  This issue is common among CRV (2017 to 2020). https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Discussion-t72370_ds1082603.

Since buying it new in April, 2018 we have had to have it towed or jump-started six times because the battery has been drained.  Many other owners seem to have similar problems; online it has become known as a \"parasitic battery drain\" problem.  There are at least two class-action suits at present we know of concerning the same problem, one In Iowa, and another in Florida.  Also on three different occasions we experienced the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems display flashing indicating some features are not working while driving -- for no apparent reason.  However, the systems gradually return to normal after the vehicle has been stopped, re-started, and driven again for several miles.  We don't know if the two issues are related (see NHTSA Complaint 11361514).  Not being able to start in an out of cell-phone area or an unpopulated area is a serious safety concern.  Additionally, I carry a portable, battery-powered oxygen concentrator that can't  be recharged when the CR-V won't start and the battery is dead. We have records and documentation to support our CRV problems. We are on our third SUV battery - a top-of-the-line from AAA - and have been doing such obvious things as checking our garage nightly to make sure a dome light isn't on, etc.   There are no preliminary cues that we have noted such as lights become dimmer, etc. prior to the non-starting times.  Four of six times have been during daylight hours.  On one occasion we were able to restart the vehicle using a portable lithium battery power pack; on another this booster failed to start the SUV and we had to call AAA.  Our \"home\" Honda service center has sincerely tried but failed to diagnose the problem and neither was the major Honda garage in Albuquerque, NM able to this past summer. Two different complaints with Honda Motors of America remain unanswered as of today.  Honda isn't supporting their dealerships.",

It disengaged quickly after and luckily the car behind me did not rear-end me.  I pulled off the road to disengage the CMBS shortly after.  I filed a similar report for my other Honda car, a 2016 Civic (incident report 11366753 in October 2020), and have not heard anything back.  At the time I took that to multiple Honda dealers and they all said there was not an issue with the system.  I find this to be a huge issue that the braking system will engage with no warning when there is no obstruction in the road.  For the last incident, it had to do with a steel plate that was on the road in a construction zone.  This time there was nothing whatsoever.  The system is supposed to have 3 levels of warning.  The first is just a flashed warning on the dash telling you to brake.  This happens all the time with our cars, most of the time for no valid reason, however the car does not engage the brakes.  The second level is when the brakes start to engage and that appears to be what happened today.  The third level is when the car engages the brakes and brings it to a complete stop which is what happened last October to me, causing another car to rear-end me.  A quick internet search shows I am certainly not alone in this and I feel this needs to be addressed via a recall or software update.",

They couldn't fix it since the part was not in stock and I was in the process of moving out of state.  Then took it to a different Honda dealer in OK in August 2020 and they tested it and also said discharge hose was leaking, they replaced hose - evac and charge system - a/c working as intended.  This was within warranty so no charge, mileage 24,675.  Then once it got hot again and tried to use the A/C, it wasn't blowing cold air again.  Took it to the Honda dealer again June 2021, mileage 28,428 and they said now it's the receiver pipe is leaking, the other pipe.  Per their notes, the service recommended is to replace 1 line and perform a/c service (looks like the a/c line from compressor to the condenser is leaking and needs replaced.)  But now it's out of warranty by a couple of months.  This seems to be an issue with 2017 - 2019 Honda CRV's from seeing it on multiple posts from other Honda owners.

I CALLED BOB BRADY HONDA SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD ME TO JUST HAVE THE TOWING COMPANY JUMPSTART MY CAR AND DRIVE IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT. NOTE, THE TOWING COMPANY DRIVER INFORMED ME THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE 13TH HONDA 2018 2020 THAT HE HAS HAD TO JUMPSTART. SOME OF THE VEHICLES HE'S HAD TO REVISIT TO JUMPSTART. I DIDN'T DRIVE THE CAR AFTER COMING HOME THE REST OF THE DAY ON THURSDAY. THE CAR STARTED ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, AT 11:30 AM. THE HONDA STARTED ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18 AT 3:30 PM. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, THE CAR STARTED AT 10:00 AM. THAT SAME DAY THE CAR STARTED AT 1:00 PM. ON SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, I WENT OUT TO TRY TO START MY CAR AT 7:00 AM. MY CAR WOULD NOT START! IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEY WILL NOT JUST FLIP OUT THE BATTERY UNTIL THEY FIRST TRY TO CHARGE IT AGAIN TO SEE IF THAT HELPS THE PROBLEM. IT IS NOW DECEMBER 14, 2020 AND I AM GOING TO CALL THE HONDA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED IN TODAY FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM OF THE BATTERY BEING DEAD! BOTH TIMES THAT THE CAR BATTERY DIED AS WELL IT WAS SITTING IN MY HEATED GARAGE. I'M NOT ABLE TO TAKE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS ON A DEAD BATTERY. BUT, I HAVE MADE A VIDEO OF EXACTLY HOW THE PROCEDURE TAKES PLACE WHEN I HAVE TRIED TO START MY CAR IN THE GARAGE.",

NOV. 3 2020, MY CAR STALLED WHILE GOING 70 MILES PER HOUR ON THE HIGHWAY. AFTERWARDS I SMELLED A STRONG FUEL SMELL IN MY CAR. I HAVE SMELLED THIS ODOR SEVERAL TIMES, HOWEVER HONDA SAYS THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. I BOUGHT THE CAR JAN. 2020. IT HAD 89K MILES ON IT. I DID NOT THINK THIS NEW CAR WOULD NEED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  SO HONDA WANTS OVER $1100 TO PUT FUEL INJECTORS IN. I HAVE READ ONLINE ABOUT THE MANY ISSUES WITH THE 2017 AND 2018 CRVS. THE DREAM MOTOR IS A PROBLEM AND HONDA KNOWS IT. I GUESS IT WILL TAKE SOMEONE DYING BEFORE ANYONE WILL PAY ME ANY ATTENTION. HONDA SAYS THIS IS NOT A SAFETY PROBLEM  THEREFORE I AM ASSUMING IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE, AS  I HAVE TO HAVE MY CAR. I AM A NURSE AND TRAVEL ON MY JOB. I HAVE NO CRUISE, LANE KEEP ASSIST, LANE STABILITY OR ANY OF THOSE FEATURES.  I DONT KNOW HOW THIS CAR WILL PASS INSPECTION LIKE THIS.  PLEASE HELP ME.

HE MENTIONED THAT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WHEEL BEARING OR THE BRAKES. ON MONDAY, AUGUST 31,  I DROPPED THE VEHICLE OFF FOR SERVICE.  WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, I HAD NEW BRIDGESTONE TIRES. I WAS CONFUSED AND STEVE COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY THE SERVICE DEPT. RECOMMENDED NEW TIRES.

LOOKING ONLINE CONSUMER REPORTS FOUND THE ADVANTA HAD AN AVERAGE TREAD LIFE OF 44,500 MILES COMPARED WITH AN AVERAGE OF 71,000 MILES FOR ALL THE TIRES. IN ADDITION, THESE TIRES HAVE POOR PERFORMANCE IN WINTER CONDITIONS.

THIS LATCH CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A 'SAFETY' DEVICE, IF IT DOESN'T NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY UNDER ALL REASONABLE CONDITIONS.    4- THIS 2018 YEAR VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW BY THE CURRENT OWNER, AND ALL MAINTENANCE CARE IS UPDATED AND ALWAYS COMPLETED BY OFFICIAL (I.E. LICENSED) HONDA SERVICE CENTERS.",

I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP AND TO AMERICAN HONDA CLIENT SERVICES WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ASKED THAT THE CMBS FEATURE BE DISABLED BECAUSE I FEAR IT WILL ACTIVATE AGAIN UNEXPECTEDLY AT SOME POINT, CAUSING A LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND, OR, A REAR END COLLISION. THEY SAID THAT THE FEATURE COULD NOT BE DISABLED. IT COULD ONLY BE SHUT DOWN BY AN ON/OFF BUTTON ON THE DASH.  HOWEVER, IT  AUTOMATICALLY RESETS WHEN YOU START THE ENGINE. BECAUSE OF THIS UNEXPECTED AND VIOLENT EXPERIENCE, I FEEL THAT THE CMBS IS A DANGEROUS FEATURE AND THAT IT COULD CAUSE A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.

THERE IS ALSO AN OIL DISILLUSION PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AS THERE IS GAS GOING INTO THE OIL CAUSING A GAS SMELL IN THE OIL AND THINNING OUT THE OIL.  ALSO THERE IS A HEATING PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AS THERE IS NO HEAT WHICH COMES OUT OF THE BLOWERS, WHICH WHERE I LIVE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOR  6-9 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR.  I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING AS I CAN ROLL DOWN MY WINDOW TO GET COOLED OFF, BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY I CAN GET HEAT IN MY CAR AND THAT IS FROM RUNNING THE ENGINE AND USING THE CLIMATE CONTROL IN THE CAR.  IN COLD WEATHER STATES WHEN DRIVING THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE BECAUSE WHEN IT SHUTS DOWN AND ISN'T  DRIVABLE AND THE CAR ISN'T ABLE TO PRODUCE HEAT WHEN YOU ARE STRANDED A PERSON COULD FREEZE TO DEATH BECAUSE OF THE CARS INABILITY TO PRODUCE HEAT WHILE STRANDED IN THE COLD WEATHER.  MY OIL ALREADY SMELLS  OF GAS AND I HAVE  DRIVEN IT LESS THAN 700 MILES SINCE THE OIL CHANGE, THAT WAS PERFORMED WITH THE RECALL.  I AM TAKING TO HONDA DEALER AGAIN FOR AN EXAM I WAS TOLD,  TO CHECK OUT SPARK PLUGS AND X-RAY THEM AND ALSO FOR ANOTHER OIL CHANGE, WITH 5219 MILES ON CAR NOW, SO WITH LESS THAN 700 MILES FROM LAST OIL CHANGE I WILL NOW BE GETTING ANOTHER.

WHEN I CHECKED THE OIL SOON AFTER THE PURCHASE I NOTICED IT APPEARED TO BE A BIT HIGH ON THE DIPSTICK.

I WAS TOLD THERE WOULD SOON BE A FIX FOR THE ISSUE AND THEY CHANGED THE OIL.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK A COUPLE WEEKS LATER TO HAVE THE FIX DONE TO THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME AND SOON AFTER FOUND THE OIL HIGHER ON THE DIPSTICK AGAIN.  I TOOK IT BACK TO HONDA SERVICE AGAIN AND THEY CHANGED THE OIL BUT DID NOT CHECK HOW MUCH OIL WAS ACTUALLY IN THE ENGINE.

THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND ANY ASSISTANCE FROM YOU WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

I BELIEVE THIS IDEA IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.:    MY FIRST EXAMPLE: I HAD A TIRE GO FLAT WHILE DRIVING ON A FREEWAY.  IT WASN'T A BLOW-OUT, JUST A TIRE THAT WENT FLAT WHILE DRIVING.  THE \"TPMS\" SYSTEM NEVER WARNED OF THE LOW TIRE AND THE TIRE WAS ACTUALLY RUINED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED..  THAT LED TO MY SECOND REASON... THE TIRE STORE REPLACED THE TIRE WITH AN IDENTICAL SIZE BUT DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER'S TIRE.  THAT RESULTED IN MULTIPLE PERIODIC WARNINGS OF \"TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR SYSTEM PROBLEM\".  TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER RESULTED IN THEM TELLING ME THAT ANY REPLACEMENT TIRE HAD TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS ORIGINALLY CAME ON THE CAR AND I MIGHT NEED TO REPLACE TWO, AND POSSIBLY ALL FOUR TIRES..  THIS SEEMS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE ON A CAR WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES ON THE TIRES!      IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE TPMS SHOULD MONITOR TIRE PRESSURE... NOT MAKE, MODEL AND TREAD PATTERN AS THE DEALER TOLD ME.    LASTLY, I GOT IN THE CAR FOR A DRIVE A FEW DAY AGO AND AFTER DRIVING DOWN MY DRIVEWAY, HEARD A NOISE AND STOPPED TO INVESTIGATE.... ANOTHER FLAT TIRE AND NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.      A SYSTEM OPERATING AS POORLY AS THIS ONE IS LESS THAN USELESS BECAUSE IF I HAD NO SYSTEM, I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE NOTIFIED OF A LOW TIRE AND WOULDN'T DEPEND ON THE SYSTEM.    WHAT ABOUT A TIRE GOING FLAT OVER NIGHT?  NO WARNING BEFORE DRIVING!    I WOULD SUBMIT THE FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM TO  NOTIFY THE DRIVER OF A LOW TIRE IN TWO, VERY OBVIOUS SCENARIOS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK AND SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.",

THE FIRST 2 TIMES, I WAS UNDER 25 MPH AND IT STARTED STALLING.  SEVERAL LIGHTS WERE FLASHING ON THE DASHBOARD CAUTIONING ENGINE FAILURE, BRAKE FAILURE, TIRE PRESSURE FAILURE, ETC.  THE CAR WAS MAKING PINGING NOISES WHILE THESE LIGHTS WERE FLASHING AND IT WOULDN'T DRIVE ANY LONGER.  I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE ME TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE 3RD TIME THIS HAPPENED, I WAS GOING ALMOST 40MPH AND IT STALLED AGAIN (SAME AS BEFORE).  THE CAR WAS ALSO SHAKING AND STUTTERING WHILE SIMPLY SITTING IDLE.  HONDA SAID THAT THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR (CPK) WAS DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED IT...HOWEVER, THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  WHEN I ASKED HONDA IF THIS STALLING ISSUE WAS RELATED TO ARTICLES DESCRIBING THE ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH THIS MAKE/MODEL (IN RECENT YEARS), THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND SAID THEY COULDN'T COMMENT BECAUSE IT WASN'T A \"HONDA ARTICLE\".  I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY CUSTOMER THAT HAS COME TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH THIS PROBLEM...YET, THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS THAT IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THEY ALSO HAVE NOT DECLARED A RECALL. THIS IS A SERIOUS LIFE-THREATENING SAFETY HAZARD.  WHEN THE CAR STALLED, I WASN'T ON THE EXPRESSWAY, BUT ON LOCAL ROADS; HOWEVER, I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR ANYMORE.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT'S GOING TO STALL AGAIN.  HONDA HAS GIVEN NO ASSURANCES THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS OR CAN EVEN FIX IT.",

IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY A FRIEND (LATE SUMMER) THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE ISSUE WITH THE 1.5 L EARTHDREAMS  HONDA ENGINE. AREA OF ISSUE IS OIL DILUTION BY FUEL \"LEAKING\" INTO IT & MIXING. I THEN BEGAN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT HONDA HAD ALREADY RECALLED A HUGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES IN CHINA WITH THIS OIL DILUTION ISSUE ON THIS SPECIFIC ENGINE. WHEN I CALLED MY HONDA DEALER TO ASK ABOUT ISSUE/REPAIR, I WAS TOLD BY SERVICE ADVISOR THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUE OF THIS TYPE AND THERE WERE NO ACTIVE RECALLS/TSBS REGARDING ISSUE. WOW? THAT'S WHEN MY CONCERN LEVEL ROSE, AS ON THE DEALER LEVEL THERE SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE DENIAL/ADMITTANCE OF ANY PROBLEM. OTHER HONDA OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITH THIS ENGINE HAVE EXPERIENCED \"GAS ODOR\" IN CABIN, POOR PERFORMANCE AND EVEN STALLING OF ENGINE WHILE DRIVING VEHICLE.

I PRESENTED THIS ISSUE TO MY DEALER, AND THEY CONFIRMED THE SMELL OF GAS IN THE OIL, THE HIGH LEVEL AND THE FACT THAT MANY 2017-18 CRV'S SUFFER FROM THIS SAME ISSUE.  THEIR UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION WAS TO CHANGE THE OIL AND MAKE LONGER TRIPS TO TRY TO BURN OFF THE GASOLINE IN THE OIL.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT HONDA WOULD BE ISSUING A STATEMENT IN THE FALL ABOUT FIXING THE ISSUE.    FIRST A BIT ABOUT THE ISSUE.  THERE ARE MANY REPORTS OF CRV OWNERS WITH THIS PROBLEM UNEXPECTEDLY STALLING AND LOSING POWER WHILE IN MOTION.  SOME HAVE SUFFERED ACCIDENTS.  DOES THIS SOUND LIKE A VEHICLE YOU'D LIKE TO PUT YOUR FAMILY IN?  ALSO, DILUTED MOTOR OIL HAS TO HAVE LONG TERM DAMAGING EFFECTS ON THE ENGINE.  I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE LONG TERM VALUE OF A CAR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GREAT RESALE VALUE - THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT.    SO HONDA ROLLS OUT THEIR \"FIX\", AND I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT THEY CONSIDER \"COLD WEATHER STATES\".

I WOULD THINK THAT HONDA WOULD TREAT ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS THE SAME AND WOULD WANT TO FIX AS MANY AFFLICTED VEHICLES AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUES.

THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED THE REGIONAL HONDA SERVICE REP AND THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE THE OIL AND FILTER AS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. HONDA USA PAID FOR THE OIL CHANGE AND TOLD THE DEALER THAT 'WE KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ONE YET.' HONDA WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF OUR SAFETY RELATED CONCERNS. WE ASKED ABOUT: ENGINE FIRE, FUEL VAPORS IN THE PASSENGER CABIN, ENGINE STALLING, HEATER/DEFROST NOT WORKING IN WINTER, DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE FROM FUEL CONTAMINATED OIL. ALL QUESTIONS HAD NO ANSWER FROM EITHER HONDA USA NOR FROM THE DEALER. AFTER ~ 600 MILES OF ADDITIONAL DRIVING, THE PROBLEM IS BACK AS THE OIL IS OVER-FULL AGAIN. IT IS LOOKING LIKE THE OIL WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED EVERY 800 MILES OF DRIVING. WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE FUEL ACCUMULATING IN OIL PROBLEM. WE ASSUME THAT THE GASOLINE IS ACCUMULATING IN THE OIL DURING ENGINE RUNNING USEAGE OF THE VEHICLE; SO INJECTOR SPRAY IS WRONG RATHER THAN A FUEL-LINE LEAK.",

USA HONDA HAS APPARENTLY KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE WITH THE CR-V FOR QUITE SOME TIME .... THEY HAVE KEPT IT UNDER THE RADAR....  IN CHINA THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL ON 350,000 CR-V'S AND THEY HAVE STOPPED SALES.... CANADA HAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE ISSUE... USA HONDA IS CLAIMING IT IS A COLD WEATHER ISSUE ....

THERE IS NO SOLUTION.... GAS IS SEEPING INTO MY OIL WRECKING THE ENGINE AS I WRITE .... HONDA NEEDS TO STOP SALES.... FESS UP AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK OR A NEW CR-V WITH THE PREVIOUSLY PROVEN ENGINE.... STAY TUNED!  MY HUSBAND FEELS OWNERS OUT THERE ARE NOT AWARE YET BECAUSE MOST DON'T CHANGE THEIR OWN OIL....

LAST FRIDAY (10/8/18), CNN NEWS REPORTED ON A CONSUMER REPORTS (CR) ARTICLE REGARDING THE CRV 2018 ENGINE PROBLEMS, INVOLVING FUEL MIXING W/ ENGINE OIL. APPARENTLY, THERE'S AN ISSUE REGARDING GAS MIXING W/ OIL IN 2017 & 2018 HONDA CRVS WITH 1.5-LITER ENGINES, POSSIBLY CAUSING STALLING AND ENGINE DAMAGE. NUMEROUS CR AND NHTSA COMPLAINTS INVOLVED STALLING, LOSS OF POWER, AND SMELL OF GAS IN THE PASSENGER CABIN. HONDA IS WORKING ON A FIX NEXT MONTH.  OWNERS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THE OIL LEVEL ON THEIR CRVS AS IT WILL BE HIGHER AND LESS VISCOUS IF MIXED W/ GAS. WE CHECKED OUR CRV'S OIL LAST NIGHT AND NOTICED THE STRONG SMELL OF GAS ON THE DIPSTICK.  BROUGHT THE CRV THIS MORNING TO OUR HONDA DEALERSHIP. SERVICE REP REPORTED THAT THEIR TEST REVEALED NO GAS MIXED W/ THE OIL AND THAT THE SMELL IS FROM A SPECIAL OIL ADDITIVE THAT HONDA USES IN NEW VEHICLES. WE WERE ADVISED TO BRING THE CRV BACK FOR AN OIL CHANGE AT 1500 MILES.   REP WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CR & NHTSA COMPLAINTS ON GAS LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE OIL, UNTIL WE TOLD HIM. WE AGREED TO BRING THE CRV BACK FOR THE OIL CHANGE.  CALLED HONDA TO CONFIRM THE FIX IN NOVEMBER AND MENTIONED OUR VISIT TO THE DEALERSHIP. CUSTOMER REP INSISTED THAT HONDA DOES NOT PUT ANY OIL ADDITIVE IN THE NEW CRVS AND THAT I WAS MISS-INFORMED BY THE SERVICE REP. I WAS REFERRED TO THE CRV MANUAL ON PAGE 572, STATING THAT OIL ADDITIVES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE AND DURABILITY. I WAS ASSURED THAT HONDA ENGINEERS ARE WORKING ON THE FIX FOR THE PROBLEM. I WAS DIRECTED TO TAKE MY CRV TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP FOR A 2ND OPINION AND OIL ANALYSIS.

NO ISSUE BEFORE OR AFTER THE 1ST OIL CHANGE FROM THE DEALERSHIP. (6000MILES) THIS WEEK AFTER A RANDOM CHECK ON THE OIL LEVEL I DISCOVERED IT WAS WAY ABOVE THE NORMAL LEVEL OIL LEVEL WITH DEFINITE GASOLINE SMELL. I TOOK IT TO A HONDA DEALER AND THEY CHECKED THE VEHICLE OVER (10000 MILES) AFTER COMPREHENSIVE TESTING INCLUDING EACH INDIVIDUAL CYLINDER THEY COULD FIND NO ISSUES. (HONDA TECH LINE WAS INVOLVED)THE DEALER SERVICE REP COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD NO FIX FOR THE ISSUE AND THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. I WAS GIVEN A FREE OIL/FILTER CHANGE AND SENT ON MY WAY.   I TOOK THE CAR TO WORK AFTER THE DEALERSHIP AND THEN HOME (40 MILES TOTAL APPROX.)  AFTER SITTING OVERNIGHT I CHECKED THE DIPSTICK TODAY AND THE LEVEL IS RIGHT WHERE THE ORANGE PLASTIC INDICATOR PIECE MEETS THE METAL DIPSTICK. ALREADY ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN. OIL WAS VERY SOUPY DRIPPING FROM DIPSTICK (NORMAL 0-20W OIL DOES NOT DO THIS)   SO JUST OVERNIGHT THE PROBLEM HAS RETURNED, NOT IN A COLD CLIMATE. NO EXCESSIVE IDLING SINCE YESTERDAY AFTER THE OIL CHANGE.   I THINK THE REASON MORE PEOPLE HAVE NOT REPORTED THIS IS MANY HAVE NOT CHECKED THEIR DIPSTICK/ OIL LEVEL. AND WHY WOULD YOU IF YOU ARE DRIVING A NEW CAR.  OIL IS BREAKING DOWN THE LUBRICATION OF THE OIL. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR A CAR WITH A TURBO WHICH DEPENDS ON THAT OIL.
