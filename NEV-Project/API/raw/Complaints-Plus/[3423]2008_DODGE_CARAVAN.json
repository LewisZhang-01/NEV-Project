I MADE THE APPOINTMENT AND WHEN I WAS SET TO DROP OFF THE VAN I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GOING TO BE CHARGED BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN PUT IN AS COMPLETE IN THE DEALERS RECORDS BUT SHOWED PARTS NOT INSTALLED. I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT DODGE AND LEFT THE VAN THERE OVERNIGHT. THE NEXT DAY I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE PHONE TO GET THE RUNAROUND WITH DODGE. I PICKED UP THE CAR AND DIDN'T HAVE THE REPAIR DONE. MY FAMILY HAS USED THE VAN EVER SINCE. I HAVE ALWAYS PUT OFF REPAIRING IT BECAUSE IT WAS A RECALL THAT BROKE DOWN AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL VERBATIM  AND IS A HAZARD FOR MULTIPLE REASONS AND I WOULD BLAME DODGE DIRECTLY IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN. I HAVE CONTACTED THEM SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH OUT THE LAST FEW YEARS TRYING TO RECTIFY THIS EGREGIOUS SITUATION. I WAS TOLD THAT THE RECORDS INDICATE ONLY ONE SIDE WAS REPAIRED HOWEVER THE RECALL STILL TO THIS DAY SHOWS COMPLETE. I TAKE PRIDE IN BUYING AND MAINTAINING AN 'AMERICAN MADE' PRODUCT AND WOULD HAVE FIXED THIS SEVERAL TIMES OVER HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR PRINCIPLE.

MY FATHER EXPLAINED THEY ALREADY HAD IT AS IT HAD BEEN SERVICED AND BOUGHT THERE.  AFTER NO RESPONSE, I EMAILED THE OWNER, [XXX]  ON 9/23/14.  HE TOLD ME SOMEONE WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH MY ELDERLY PARENTS TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIRS AND THEY WOULD ALSO SHUTTLE THEM TO AND FROM THE DEALERSHIP.    SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, THEY ARE STILL GETTING THE RUN AROUND.  A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THEY CALLED THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULD BRING IT IN AND LITHIA WOULD PUT IN THE RECALLS THAT THEY HAD ON HAND, BUT THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO WAIT.  AT ONE POINT THEY WERE TOLD THEY WERE #7 ON THE LIST, BUT THE NEXT TIME THEY CALLED THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO TOLD THEM THIS.  THEY CALLED ONE TIME AND WERE TOLD THAT LITHIA WAS WAITING FOR ALL OF THE RECALLED PARTS TO COME IN BUT NOW WHEN THEY CALL THEY ARE TOLD THEY CAN REPAIR WHAT THEY HAVE.      THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS WITH NO RESOLUTION.  MY FATHER IS NOW FIGHTING STAGE 4 CANCER AND IS UNABLE TO DRIVE SO MY MOTHER IS THE ONLY DRIVER AND I FEEL THE VAN IS UNSAFE FOR HER TO DRIVE.  I HAVE EMAILED THE OWNER SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THIS INCIDENT AND HE WILL NO LONGER RESPOND.  I DO HAVE ALL EMAILS TO AND FROM HIM SAVED.

WHEN THE CONSUMER TURNED ON THE HIGH BEAMS, THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS CAME ON INSTEAD AND WOULD NOT TURN OFF. THE BLINKERS DID NOT WORK,  THE AC AND RADIO STOPPED WORKING, BUT AFTER PARKING AND RESTARING THE VEHICLE, THEY WORKED AGAIN.  WHEN THE CONSUMER TURNED ON THE VEHICLE, EVERYTHING WENT HAYWIRE; THE THE FRONT AND REAR WIPERS CAME ON, SPRAYING WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, ALL THE  LIGHTS WERE FLASHING, THE LOCKS WERE LOCKING AND UNLOCKING AND THE HORN STARTING BEEPING. ON ANOTHER OCCASSION, ALL THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, LEAVING THE CONSUMER WITH NO HEADLIGHTS, TAILLIGHTS, BLINKERS ETC.  THE DEALER REPLACED A MODULE IN LOCATED IN THE FUSE BOX. THE CONSUMER STATED IT HAS BEEN 4 DAYS SINCE THE REPLACEMENT, AND SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEMS. UPDATED 09/24/08. *JB",

I DROVE THE SHOULDER AT 30MPH AND TOOK AN EXIT. ROADSIDE ASSIST TOWED IT TO HELMS DODGE. THEY PULLED A \"P0750\" DTC CODE (SOLENOID A FAULT I THINK) BUT THE TRANSMISSION HAD RESET AND THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT GO BAD IN 13 MILES OF DRIVING. I ASKED THEM TO CHECK FLUID LEVEL -- THEY SAID THEY WOULD. THEY SAID IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO TURN IT OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES AND IT MAY RESET AGAIN. BUT, I MADE IT HOME TO OHIO AGAIN WITHOUT INCIDENT. TODAY, AT 2,900 MILES, IT HAPPENED AGAIN! MY WIFE HAD JUST DRIVEN IT HOME FROM WORK AND PARKED FOR 30 MINUTES (ENGINE OFF). WE WENT TO GO OUT TO EAT AND 1000 FEET FROM HOME (AT 20 MPH) IT WENT INTO LIMP. BUT NO ENGINE LIGHT THIS TIME. I DROVE BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND LET IT SIT (OFF) ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THEN I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT SHIFTED OKAY. I CALLED THE KINGS' CHRYSLER/DODGE DEALER SERVICE REP (ROB) AND HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE IT TOWED IN BY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. WHICH I JUST DID... BILL'S TOWING PICKED IT UP AT 9:15 (11-7-07)     TO BE CONTINUED....   *TR",
