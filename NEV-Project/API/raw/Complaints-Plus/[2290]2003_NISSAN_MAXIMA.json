I have tried both Auto Zone and Hitachi, and neither of them solves the problem.  I also paid to have the crankshaft sensor below replaced, and that didn't help.   I am told that this problem has been posted online and it was recommended to only use OEM parts.   This is very dangerous to lose power while in traffic, and then having to wait until the engine will restart, which eventually it does.   This is an ongoing problem.  PLEASE help!!!",

ONCE IN, IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO TAKE THE LIGHTS. IT'S NOT THE LIGHTS THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE AFTER, RATHER THE HARDWARE THAT POWERS THE LIGHTS. ONCE THEY HAVE THE HARDWARE THEY CAN PUT IT IN ANY CAR. HAD I KNOWN THAT THESE LIGHTS WERE SUCH A HOT ITEM, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR. NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM SO THEY HAVE PROVIDED REPAIR FACILITIES WITH REPAIR KITS TO MAKE THE TURN AROUND TIME SHORTER. BUT THAT DOES NOTHING TO THE FEELING OF HAVING YOUR CAR VIOLATED.  I DRIVE IN FEAR NOW. I CAN'T GO TO THE MOVIES. IF I GO TO THE MALL I HAVE TO SIT IN THE CAR AND SEND THE WIFE IN TO DO THE SHOPPING. NOW THAT THE WEATHER IS GETTING WARM AGAIN I WORRY EVEN MORE. I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE AT LEAST $500 (DEDUCTIBLE) ON A CREDIT CARD SOMEWHERE FOR THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL. *JB",
