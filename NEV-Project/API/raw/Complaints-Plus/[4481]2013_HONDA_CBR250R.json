IT SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR TO THE REPORTED INCIDENT ALREADY ON FILE WITH NHTSA FOR THE KAWASAKI NINJA 300 (HTTP://WHEELS.BLOGS.NYTIMES.COM/2013/06/24/KAWASAKI-FACES-N-H-T-S-A-INQUIRY-OVER-POSSIBLE-STALLING-ISSUE/).    THE ENGINE STALLING HAS OCCURRED 4 TIMES IN THE PAST 4 WEEKS. THE MOTORCYCLE WAS PURCHASED NEW AT MISSION MOTORCYCLES IN DALY CITY IN MARCH 2013. THE BIKE WAS TAKEN INTO THE DEALER ON JULY 3RD TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE. DEALER REPORTED \"THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE ISSUE\", THEREFORE NOTHING COULD BE DONE.    I FEEL THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD TO HAVE THE ENGINE STALL WHILE DOWNSHIFTING AND HOPE NHTSA INVESTIGATES THIS MATTER.    FURTHER REPORTS OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH THE HONDA CBR250R CAN BE FOUND AT THESE FORUM:    HTTP://WWW.CBR250.NET/FORUM/CBR250-PROBLEMS-ISSUES/2100-MY-CBR250S-ENGINE-TURNS-OFF-WHEN-DOWNSHIFTING.HTML.  *TR",
