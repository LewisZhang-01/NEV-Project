My brakes are doing the exact problem indicated in this article: https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/gm-recalls-suvs-and-pickups-for-braking-issue/  When the brakes malfunction, I feel a vibrating brake pedal, feels like my vehicle is not going to stop on time, I hear a ticking noise from the engine and my Brake Assist Service light comes on. The issue continues until I can pull over and restart the vehicle. It is a very uneasy feeling having to drive a vehicle that you do not feel safe in. I called 800 Chevrolet's Customer Service number provided in the article and they are unaware of the recall mentioned in this article. I do not know where to go from here. I just want my vehicle fixed and to feel safe. My 2nd issue is regarding my Adaptive Cruise Control. I've had it in the shop 3 times for this also and they did replace a part but that did not fix this issue. I will be driving down the highway or interstate and out of the blue my alarm starts dinging, the seat vibrates, the cruise control gets kicked off and I get an alert on my dash stating that the Adaptive Cruise Control was disabled. Each time it has happened to me there is nothing around but it immediately starts reducing my speed. If someone were behind me it could cause a crash because of the unexpected speed limit reduction.  When you go in to look at recalls on 2018 Chevrolet Tahoes it shoes that there is 3 of them that have been issued, yet my VIN is not included in any of them?  What can I do from here? I've called Chevrolet's 800 # and they created a \"High Urgency Case\" but I have not heard back. Attached are my copies of service records and vehicle summary showing there has never been recalls on my VIN #.",

        "summary": "I OWN A 2018 CHEVROLET TAHOE PREMIERE WITH THE RST 6.2L PERFORMANCE PACKAGE.  THIS VEHICLE HAS THE OPTIONAL PERFORMANCE FRONT BRAKE UPGRADE SYSTEM.      I RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING RECALL: GM PROGRAM # N182155600, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM #18119 - SPARE TIRE DOES NOT FIT OVER PERFORMANCE FRONT BRAKE KIT.      THE VEHICLE HAS A 17 INCH SPARE TIRE WHICH WILL NOT FIT OVER THE FRONT BRAKES WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THE PERFORMANCE BRAKE KIT.      THE SOLUTION PROPOSED BY CHEVROLET FOR A FLAT FRONT TIRE IS A DUAL TIRE CHANGE (REPLACE A REAR TIRE WITH THE SPARE AND MOVE THE REAR TIRE TO THE FRONT).      THE CHEVROLET DEALER IS TO PRINT AND INSTALL AN INSERT TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL DESCRIBING THIS DUAL TIRE CHANGE.      THIS SOLUTION COMPROMISES SAFETY, ESPECIALLY IF THE DUAL TIRE CHANGE HAS TO OCCUR ON THE SIDE OF A BUSY HIGHWAY.  IT DOES NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS FOR A PREMIUM SUV.      CHEVROLET SHOULD PROVIDE A SPARE TIRE (FREE OF CHARGE) THAT WILL FIT OVER THE PERFORMANCE FRONT BRAKE KIT.  AN APPROPRIATE SPARE TIRE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE FRONT BRAKE UPGRADE OPTION.      I CALLED THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER REGARDING THIS ISSUE.  THEIR REPRESENTATIVE WAS RUDE AND NO HELP AT ALL.  HIS ONLY REPLY WAS THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE THIS MATTER UP WITH MY CHEVROLET DEALER.      SO I DID THAT AND THE DEALER CHECKED WITH THEIR CHAIN-OF-COMMAND WITHIN CHEVROLET.  THEIR ZONE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO OTHER THAN PROVIDE THE OWNER'S MANUAL INSERT.      MY COMPLAINT IS NOT WITH THE DEALER.  I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE SPARE TIRE AT THEIR COST.  A RIM AND TIRE FOR THIS VEHICLE (THAT WILL FIT OVER THE PERFORMANCE FRONT BRAKE KIT) IS VERY EXPENSIVE.      MY COMPLAINT IS AGAINST GM AND CHEVROLET CORPORATE REGARDING THEIR UNACCEPTABLE RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM.",
