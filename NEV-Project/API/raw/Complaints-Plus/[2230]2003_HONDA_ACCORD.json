        "summary": "My son is an approved seatbelt claimant in the Takata Bankruptcy class action suit. (#4842)  He became a paraplegic when his 2003 Honda Accord rolled once after encountering a road surface change from asphalt to gravel. His seatbelt pre-tensor failed as did his airbags. His T-13 L-1 spinal cord injury is conducive to seat belt failure.    .    A bone spur from his vertebre broke off and went into his spinal cord. By the time our head cleared from the whole ordeal, we were one month out of the statue of limitations. (which is 2 years in the state of Colorado)  Shortly thereafter we received a card in the mail informing us of the Takata class action suit.  We were glad we still had an avenue for an injury claim. Fast forward 4+ years and we have recently found out that the 33 approved Takata seatbelt claimants have $1,140,000 to share amongst themselves. Some claimants lost loved ones from the faulty seatbelt sensors and seatbelt malfunctions. Based on this current fund amount,  Lee will likely only receive between 20,000 to 40,000 for his injury. Very little for the inability to walk, go to the bathroom, loss of sexual function and having to deal with consistent nerve pain. I recently became aware of the ZF-TRW Class action complaint and realize the parameters of the nonfunctioning airbag and seatbelt pre-tensor fit the parameters of my sons accident.  The Honda Accord 2014-2015 vehicles are listed as having problematic ZF-TRW parts.  My sons 2003 Honda Accords ACU was replaced in January/February of 2015.  I suspect that the part was replaced with the same ACU used in the new 2014-2015 Honda Accords. Takata seat belt class action suit settlement does not preclude anyone from collecting compensation for injury from another source.   My son should have walked away from this accident.",

Recall 13-012 was issued May 14, 2013 (see link to recall here:  https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2012/RCRIT-12V222-9834.pdf) The vehicle record for this VIN shows repair for Recall 13-012 was made April 3, 2013 - a month and a half prior to he issuance of Recall 13-012.    Mileage on  April 3, 2013 was 27,783.  This complaint is being filed with the NHTSA because the same power steering feed hose purportedly replaced April 3, 2013 with an upgraded  more heat resident hose is leaking again.  This is significant because the original hose lasted 10 years (2003 to 2013) and 27,783 miles while the purportedly upgraded recall replacement hose lasted only 8 years - with present mileage being 66,321.  Honda dealer will not provide additional repair stating recall has been satisfied.   Clearly power steering leak is continuing to pose a under hood fire safety issue with location over hot catalytic converter.   Thank you for allowing this issue to be brought to NHTSA's attention.",

HE ASKED US IF WE HAD MADE ANY ELECTRICAL MODIFICATIONS (WHICH WE HAVEN'T) I ASKED HIM IF THAT PART HAD BEEN CHECKED OR REPLACED DURING THE RECALL AND HE SAID THAT WASN'T PART OF THE RECALL. HE SAID WE SHOULD CALL  HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION I LEARNED THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS ON THE REPLACEMENTS  BECAUSE OF MOISTURE BEING INTRODUCED DURING MANUFACTURING.ALSO THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH CORROSION AND MALFUNCTION OF THE SRS UNITS DUE TO EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND HIGH HUMIDITY. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE HEAT INDEX WAS 110 AND THE HUMIDITY WAS EXTREMELY HIGH. ARKANSAS IS LOCATED IN THE SECOND OF THREE PRIORITY REGIONS FOR THE SRS RECALL.ALSO WHILE RESEARCHING SPONTANEOUS AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT CAUSES, I LEARNED THAT THE SRS UNIT MOISTURE PROBLEM AND THE DEGRADATION OF ACCELERANT FROM MOISTURE CAN NOT ONLY CAUSE THE AIRBAGS TO NOT DEPLOY ON IMPACT, BUT ALSO CAUSE THEM TO DEPLOY WITH NO IMPACT.

COME WEB TO FIND OUT THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD UNRESOLVED PROBLEM THAT IS ENDANGERING EVERYONE IN AND AROUND THESE VEHICLES. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY SAID IN 2004 THE VEHICLE ALREADY HAD THE RECALL PERFORMED, BUT MUCH LIKE THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO ENDED UP WITH THIS CAT IT DID NOT FIX THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION AND HONDA KNOWS THAT THE ISSUE STILL EXISTS AND WANTS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE PAYING TO GET THE SAME PROBLEMATIC REBUILT TRANSMISSION. I CAN NOT BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF THESE TRANSMISSIONS HAVEN'T BEEN RECALLED, AND IF NEEDED I WILL PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST HONDA ESPECIALLY HAVING A 1 YEAR  OLD DAUGHTER IN A KNOWN ROLLING DEATH TRAP. ONCE IT GETS TO FIRST IT FLASHES D ON THE DASH AND THE CHECK ENGINE COMES ON. MY TCS AND ABS IS ALSO TRIPPED BY THIS ISSUE CAUSING FURTHER RISK OF ENDANGERING OTHER DRIVERS AND MYSELF.  EVERY SEARCH I HAVE MADE ON THIS VEHICLE DAYS THE SAME AS I'M SAYING NOW, BUT AT VARYING STAGES.

HIS CAUGHT MY ATTENTION SINCE I THINK I DO HAVE A PROBLEM PROBABLY RELATED TO IT. I BOUGHT THIS CAR IN MAY LAST YEAR, FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE, AND SOON AFTER, I NOTICED  A SHAKING IN THE GAS PEDAL, EVERY TIME I WAS ACCELERATING BETWEEN 25 TO 35 MPH (CITY AND HIGHWAY). THE SHAKING ALWAYS GO AWAY WHEN I STOP SPEEDING IT FOR A SECOND, AND THEN CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE. IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN.  IT FIRST, AND BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE TURN ON, I TOOK IT TO THE MECHANIC, AND I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC. WELL, I DID IT AND...THE PROBLEM PERSISTED.  AM I IN DANGER HERE?.

I CHECKED THE POWER STEERING FLUID, AND IT WAS EMPTY.  I GOT THE APPROPRIATE POWER STEERING FLUID SPECIFICALLY FOR HONDAS AND REFILLED IT.  IN SEPT 2015, ON MY WAY TO WORK IN THE MORNING, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER MY HOOD.  IT IS A 10 MINUTE COMMUTE FOR ME THROUGH THE CITY STREETS.  THE SMOKE BEGAN WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE MY WORK AT A STOPLIGHT.  I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE PARKING LOT WHEN I REALIZED THE UNDERSIDE OF MY HOOD HAD CAUGHT FIRE. (SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS) THAT DAY, I GOT IT TO THE MECHANIC, AND HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE CRACKS IN THE POWER STEERING AND FLUID WAS EVERYWHERE UNDER MY HOOD, ALL OVER MY ENGINE.  DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, I SAW A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM, WITH MY EXACT CAR: NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID# IS: 12V222000; MAY 17, 2012.  IT STATES THAT \"PROLONGED UNDER HOOD AND POWER STEERING FLUID TEMPERATURES MAY CAUSE THE POWER STEERING HOSE TO DETERIORATE PREMATURELY, RESOLING IN CRACKS AND POWER STEERING FLUID LEAKAGE.  IF THIS OCCURS, POWER STEERING FLUID CAN LEAD ONTO A HOT CATALYTIC CONVERTER, LEADING TO SMOKE AND UNDER HOOD FIRE.\"  WHEN I CALLED INTO HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONFIRM MY CAR APPLIED TO THIS RECALL, THEY SAID IT DID NOT.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS EXACT PROBLEM CAN EXIST FOR MY CAR, BUT MY CAR NOT BE LISTED AS EFFECTED.  REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY SAY, MY CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE. MY CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE FOR THE SAME REASON HONDA RECALLED  625,762 OTHER VEHICLES FOR POWER STEERING DEFECTS.   AS I CANNOT AFFORD TO FIX THE POWER STEERING, I WAS HOWEVER FORCED TO REPLACE THE BELT THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE POWER STEERING FLUID RESERVOIR (SEE PHOTOS), BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AND MANGLED.

I WAS TRAVELING AT ROUGHLY 55 ? 60 MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE ENTIRE CAR VIOLENTLY JERKED. IT WAS ENOUGH TO THROW MY HEAD INTO THE STEERING WHEEL.

ON AUG 26, 2014 I LEFT MY WORK AND ENTERED THE FREEWAY RAMP AT ABOUT 30 MPH READY TO ACCELERATE AND MERGE WITH TRAFFIC. THE CAR STARTED HESITATING AND THE RPMS WOULD RACE WITHOUT THE CAR PICKING UP SPEED.  CONCERNED ABOUT THE CARS BEHIND ME AND MAKING A VERY FAST DECISION TO MOVE RIGHT AS FAST AS I COULD WITHOUT GETTING REAR ENDED, I MANAGED TO EXIT THE FREEWAY TO A RIGHT OFF RAMP. I EXPERIENCED THE SAME RPM ACCELERATION A WEEK OR TWO PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, BUT I THOUGHT I HAD JUST HIT THE GAS PEDDLE IN A STRANGE WAY WHILE DRIVING.  I EXITED THE FREEWAY AND DROVE HOME.  WHEN I ARRIVED BY MY HOME 10 MINUTES LATER, THE CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING AND I DRIFTED INTO A PARKING SPACE ON THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE. A FAMILY MEMBER HELPED ME STRAIGHTEN OUT THE CAR IN TWO MOVES AFTER I PLACED IT IN NEUTRAL. I ENDED UP TOWING THE CAR TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHO DIAGNOSED IT AS AA BROKE TRANSMISSION.

IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE CAR IS IN SECOND GEAR IT FEELS LIKE ITS IN NEUTRAL BECAUSE YOU STEP ON THE GAS AND THE CAR DOES NOT MOVE. YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CAR TO SHIFT AGAIN. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR WHERE IT WILL HAPPEN. ON 11/17/14 I WAS TRYING TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY. I MADE A LEFT TURN TO ENTER THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE SECOND GEAR SLIPPED. MY CAR WAS STUCK UNDER A TRAFFIC LIGHT WHEN THE TRAFFIC LIGHT CHANGED FROM GREEN TO RED. ONCOMING TRAFFIC WAS APPROACHING MY VEHICLE AT 65-70MPH. I WAS ALMOST BROAD SIDED. HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THIS DEFECT AND WILL NOT REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN MY CAR. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST HONDA FOR THIS PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE NOT JUST FOR ME BECAUSE I OWN THE CAR, BUT FOR ANYONE WHO IS OPERATING A VEHICLE ON THE ROADWAYS. HONDA SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS DEFECT. I ALSO HAVE A TAKATA AIRBAG WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL. SO I HAVE 2 PROBLEMS, THE DEFECT WITH THE TRANSMISSION PUTS ME AT A HIGHER RISK FOR GETTING INTO AND ACCIDENT.

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS TRAFFIC WAS CONTINUOUS WHERE WE WERE CROSSING.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS WITHOUT SYMPTOMS, WITH MAINTENANCE KEPT....   THE TRANSMISSION WAS A 4 YEAR OLD HONDA DEALERSHIP REPLACEMENT FOR ANOTHER TRANSMISSION WHICH FAILED IN MAY 2010.

HONDA HAD A RECALL ON THE ORIGINAL 2003 ACCORD V6 TRANSMISSION, WHICH THEY \"FIXED\" WITH AN ADD ON KIT IN 2004, NOT A REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  HONDA REFUSED TO PAY FOR OR CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION IN 2004 OR IN 2010!  HONDA NEVER REPORTED BACK TO ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF FAILURE TO THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION WHICH THEY TOOK UPON INSTALLATION OF REPLACEMENT IN 2010.

FIVE YEARS LATER THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF 2ND GEAR AND I DO NOT DRIVE MANY MILES PER YEAR. I TOOK THE CAR TO AAMCO BECAUSE HONDA WAS TALKING ABOUT CHARGING ME OVER $3000.00 FOR THE REPAIR BUT AT NO TIME DID THE REPRESENTATIVE AT HONDA STATE THAT THIS COULD BE DUE TO THE RECALL AND THAT HONDA MAY IN FACT REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AT NO COST TO ME IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE PREVIOUS RECALL.

I'VE RECEIVED A COUPLE OF RECALL NOTICES HOWEVER, UPON TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER, ONCE THEY KEPT IT& CLAIMED TO FIX THE STEERING ISSUES HOWEVER, THEY STILL EXIST. I TOOK IT A SECOND TIME, THEY HAD THE CAR ALL OF 20 MINS. AND TOLD ME THAT THIS ISSUE WAS FIXED PREVIOUSLY. I'M CONTINUOUSLY HAVING ISSUES WITH THE STEERING WHINING, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I SERVICE THE FLUIDS.  MY RADIO & ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN THE CAR, IS CONSTANTLY ON THE BLINK OR NOT WORKING.  NOW THE PASSENGER WINDOW DECIDES NOT TO GO UP.  ONE DAY, AS I WAS EXITING THE VEHICLE (TURNED OFF!) IT DECIDED TO ROLL BACKWARDS.LUCKILY BOTH FEET WERE NOT OUT THE CAR AND I COULD CATCH IT! I'VE INVESTED SO MUCH MONEY IN KEEPING THIS CAR RUNNING UNTIL MY MECHANIC KNOWS WHAT GOING WRONG BEFORE THE RECALLS COME OUT.  HE'S SERVICED SO MANY \"03\" ACCORDS, UNTIL HE'S THINKING OF BECOMING A SPECIALIST FOR HONDAS.   I JUST WANT HONDA TO CORRECT ALL RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE. MY STUDENT DEPENDS ON IT.! HOW ARE THESE CAR MANUFACTURERS ALLOWED TO KEEP ROBBING ITS CUSTOMERS???  MY ADDRESS HAS CHANGED SINCE MY LAST COMPLAINT. SEE BELOW.  *TR",

WHEN THIS HAPPENED, THE RPM'S WOULD GO UP AND THE CAR FELT LIKE IT WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE, JUST COASTING, THEN IT SEEMED TO JUST JOLT BACK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE. THE PROBLEM WASN'T HAPPENING EVERY TIME I DROVE, BUT RECENTLY IT STARTED HAPPENING MORE OFTEN AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. I TAKE THE CAR TO ONE PLACE TO HAVE ALL MY WORK DONE ON IT, SO I TOOK IT THERE, BUT THEY FELT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE INTERNAL AND RECOMMENDED I TAKE IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP. THEY DID DIAGNOSTICS ON THE CAR AND DROVE IT. THE RESULT, THE CAR IS GOING INTO TRANSMISSION FAILURE. THE TRANSMISSION FLUID IS BLACK AND BURNED AND HAS DEBRIS IN IT, AND THEY SAID THAT THE CLUTCHES ARE ALSO BURNED. THEY WON'T KNOW THE COMPLETE PICTURE UNTIL THEY TAKE THE TRANSMISSION APART AND GET A GOOD LOOK. IT IS 5 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX IT OR WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY CHRISTMAS AND NOW I HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION TO DO ANYTHING! SOOOO FRUSTRATED. I THOUGHT HONDA'S WERE SUPPOSE TO BE SUCH GOOD CARS, BUT I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS ONE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A TRANSMISSION SHOULD GO OUT AT 113,000 MILES AND I HAVE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THE SAME THING. NOW THAT MY TRANSMISSION IS GOING OUT, I READ UP ON IT AND FIND OUT THERE WAS A RECALL IN 2004 FOR THE 2003 HONDA ACCORDS. WHY, AM I JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS?? *TR",

THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE HONDA ACCORDS 2003-2007 WHERE ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ( PCB) WHICH CONTROLS THE CENTER AUDIO CONSOLE FAILS AND THEN THE WHOLE AUDIO CONSOLE GOES DARK. SO WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING THE CAR, YOU CANNOT SEE ANY BUTTON OR KNOB ON THE CENTER CONSOLE. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE HEAT / COOL , THE FAN SPEED OR ANY FUNCTION THAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE COUNTER CONSOLE.   HONDA INITIALLY SENT OUT A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN AND THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE AUDIO CONSOLE TO 7 YEARS /100, 000 MILES. BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CARS.  THIS IS NOT LIKE A TRANSMISSION OR A BRAKE ISSUE WHICH CAN WEAR DOWN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRONICS ON THE CAR AND SHOULD BE ESCALATED TO A RECALL.   THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AS THE CONSOLE LIGHTING DOES COMPLETELY DARK AND THE DRIVER CANNOT SEE OR LOCATE ANY CONTROLS WITHIN THE CAR. THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN DRIVING AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  HONDA HAS ISSUES A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER 04-027. THIS BULLETIN IN THE PROOF THAT HONDA KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT HONDA HAS OFFERED IS OF NO USE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ARE OUT OF THE WARRANTY TERMS ( 7 YEARS // 100,000 MILES)    THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM AND THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY INSTITUTE SHOULD FORCE HONDA TO REPAIR THIS COMPONENT IN THE CAR IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MILES OR THE NUMBER OF YEARS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS IS  A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND IS NOT RELATED TO BREAK DOWN OF A COMPONENTS BECAUSE OF MILES OR YEARS. THERE IS NO WEAR AND TEAR INVOLVED WITH PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS. ( PCB)  *TR",

THE REAL ISSUE IS THE TRANSMISSION, THE PAST FEW RECALLS INCLUDE JET KITS AND IGNITION SWITCHES AND A FEW FLASH FILE UPDATES TO TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE NEVER TRULY ADDRESSING THE REAL ISSUE WHICH IS A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT. THE RECALLS ARE LIKE ANY OTHER RECALL WHEN A LARGE REPAIR IS NEEDED ON A BROAD SCALE, SMALLER MORE BAND-AID LIKE REPAIRS ARE INSTITUTED AS RECALLS TO GET THE VEHICLE OUT OF WARRANTY AND NO LONGER A PROBLEM FOR HONDA. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF IRRESPONSIBILITY IS THIS, THE ISSUE IS NOT A CYLINDER WEAR ISSUE AND IT ISN'T A FUEL PUMP FAILING ISSUE THAT SIMPLY IS A FINANCIAL INCONVENIENCE TO THE OWNER, IT IS A PROBLEM WITH A TRANSMISSION FAILING TO STAY ENGAGED, A PROBLEM THAT IS LEAVING DRIVERS IN THE MIDDLE OF ROADS. A PROBLEM THAT IS CAUSING CAR TO LOSE POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF MERGING INTO TRAFFIC OR CHANGING LANES, OR AT ANY MOMENTS WITHOUT WARNING, ENDANGERING THE DRIVER.

I TURN OFF THE CAR AND START IT UP AGAIN, IT DRIVES FINE ALL THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AND CHARGE THE $100 DIAGNOSTIC FEE.  I DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT AND IT IMMEDIATELY STARTS SLIPPING BETWEEN 2-3 GEARS AND DOWNSHIFTING; SO I DRIVE IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE SHOP AND THEY SAY THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPLACED. TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT RUN ROUGHLY $5000.  CAR IS AT 85,000 MILES, ALL MAINTENANCES AND 3000-MILE OIL CHANGES PERFORMED, CAR HAS REQUIRED MANY VISITS TO THE SHOP FOR MALFUNCTIONING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS AND PROBLEMATIC BRAKES.  HONDA CLAIMS ALL RECALLS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, INCLUDING A RECALL FOR A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION PART THEY NEVER REPLACED WITH A WORKING PART.  THE TECHNICIAN INFORMS ME I AM ABLE TO DRIVE HOME GRANTED I CAN DEAL WITH SOME SLIPPAGE OF GEARS, IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY, I WOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW, AND I DO A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING.  NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE YET TO CORRECT THIS FAILURE, I BELIEVE HONDA SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE THESE DANGEROUSLY FAULTY PARTS IN ALL OF ITS VEHICLES.  *KB",

DID ALL OF THAT STARTING ON MAY 24, 2011 AND AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF WAITING HONDA SAID IT WOULD COST AROUND $3700 FOR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION OF WHICH I MUST PAY AROUND $2200.    I HAVE APPEALED AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, HAS ADMITTED IT IS DEFECTIVE PARTS.  PLUS I MADE SOME CALLS TO SEVERAL TRANSMISSION REBUILD OUTFITS AND THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IT WOULD COST ME $2100 FOR A COMPLETE REBUILD AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION ABOUT DEFECTIVE HONDA TRANSMISSIONS FOR HONDAS RUNNING FROM 2001 TO 2005.  MY ARGUMENT IS THAT HONDA KNOWS THIS IS A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION, I HAVE PROVIDED THE PROOF THAT THIS CAR HAS BEEN WELL-MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE AND THAT EVERYONE ELSE?S REBUILD QUOTES $2100.

THEY OFFERED TO PAY HALF OF THE COST ($2000.00) BUT WE FEEL THERE IS A LIFE THREATENING PROBLEM WITH THAT TRANSMISSION AND AFTER SEEING ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS OF HONDA'S, THE YEARS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2003, THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME LIFE THREATENING EXPERIENCES, WE ARE APPALLED THAT THE PUBLIC HAS NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS. NOT JUST BY A CHECK ON YOUR TRANSMISSION BUT A COMPLETE RECALL. I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT WE WERE NOT FATALLY INJURED.",

WHEN ASKED IF IT NEEDED TO BE FIXED RIGHT AWAY, THE ADVISOR STATED THAT THE POWER STEERING FLUID WAS DRIPPING DIRECTLY DOWN ONTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND COULD START A FIRE.  HE STATED THAT HE HAS SEEN CARS COME IN FOR REPAIR THAT WERE SMOKING A LOT OR HAD BEEN ON FIRE FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM.  THE HOSE WAS REPLACED, AND THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS BY THE HONDA MECHANIC CONFIRMED THE ADVISOR'S INITIAL DIAGNOSIS - THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE HIGH PRESSURE FITTING THAT WAS HOUSED IN THE SUPPORT BRACKET.  COST TO REPLACE WAS $412.  OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED ON THE NHTSA COMPLAINT WEBSITE - AND THAT'S ONLY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO REPORTED (OR KNEW TO REPORT) THE PROBLEM.",

THIS IS WHERE I WAS ALMOST REAR-ENDED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE WHILE ATTEMPTING ACCELERATE ON TO THE FREEWAY AND THE CAR WOULD NOT DOWNSHIFT - BUT RED-LINED AND WOULDN'T ACCEL.    I'VE NOTICED THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2003 HONDA ACCORDS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FILED ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE SO I AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT HONDA DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THESE TRANSMISSIONS TO BE DEFECTIVE AND AGREE TO HELP THE CONSUMER FIX THEM.

I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 1999 HONDA ACCORD, AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

I ALSO TRIED DRIVING AROUND TOWN WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN D3 TO SEE IF THAT WOULD OVERCOME THE SLIDING AND HARD SHIFTING; IT DID NOT. THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE A NOTICEABLE HARD DOWNSHIFT WHEN HOT, CREATING A PATTERN OF VERY SURPRISING HARD DOWNSHIFTING THAT GOT WORSE VERY QUICKLY.

THIS TRANSMISSION WAS RECALLED IN 2004 FOR THE 2ND GEAR OF THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION BECAUSE IT WOULD OVER HEAT AND POSSIBLY EXPLODE DESTROYING THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAD THE \"FIX\" HONDA IMPLEMENTED FOR THIS RECALL DONE SHORTLY AFTER I RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE.  I HAVE HAD THE TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGED AT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP ONLY A MINIMUM OF EVERY TWO YEARS AS HONDA ADVISED ME TO DO PERTAINING TO THEIR MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE AND MY DRIVING CONDITIONS.  I HAD MY TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGED 2 WEEKS PRIOR TO THE TRANSMISSION FAILING AND IT WOULD SLIP OUT OF 2ND GEAR GOING INTO 3RD GEAR AT A FREQUENCY OF ONCE PER DAY FOR THREE DAYS IN A ROW AND THEN WOULD NOT HAPPEN FOR A COUPLE DAYS.  THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED BY LETTING OF THE GAS AND THE CAR WOULD SHIFT INTO 3RD SUCCESSFULLY.  IT WILL FAIL TO ACCELERATE WHEN IT SHIFTS FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR. IT VARIES IN TIME WHEN IT WILL RE-ENGAGE AND IT HAS LEFT ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION SEVERAL TIMES AND THERE IS NO WARNING FOR THIS FAILURE. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES AND SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM OF THIS YEAR AND MODEL. RECENTLY I PULLED OUT ONTO A ROADWAY AND BEGAN TO ACCELERATE, WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO ENGAGE WHEN SHIFTING INTO 3RD GEAR, EN ROUTE TRAFFIC CAUGHT UP TO ME AND MY ABRUPT FAILURE TO ACCELERATE/MERGE WITH TRAFFIC, CAUSED A NEAR ACCIDENT OF SEVERAL OF THOSE  VEHICLES THAT WERE APPROACHING WITH WET ROAD CONDITIONS AS TO MY VEHICLE THAT WAS ABRUPTLY STRANDED AND NON-MOBILE. I WAS NEARLY REAR ENDED AND HAD NO WARNING THAT THIS FAILURE IS GOING TO OCCUR. THE CAR THAT WAS BEHIND ME WAS ABLE TO SWERVE TO THE SHOULDER TO AVOID STRIKING MY CAR WITH THE FRONT END OF THEIR VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND AM VERY CONCERNED AS I HAVE READ OF HUNDREDS OF THE EXACT SAME ISSUE I HAVE WITH THE SAME 2003 HONDA ACCORD I OWN.  HONDA HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  *TR",

THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURRED WHEN THE CAR WAS HOT (DRIVING MORE THAN 30-40 MINUTES); I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM 3 TIMES.  IT FELT LIKE SLAMMING ON BRAKES AND I WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD GET REAR-ENDED SINCE THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO OCCUR ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS AFTER TRAVELING AT HIGHER SPEEDS. I DID NOT WAIT LONG TO GET IT DIAGNOSED & FIXED BECAUSE THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I DID SOME RESEARCH & FOUND A WEBSITE WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE (HTTP://CDONNER.COM/HONDA-ACCORD-2003-EX-V6-TRANSMISSION-FAILURE.HTM). I INITIALLY TOOK MY CAR TO KUHN HONDA IN TAMPA TO GET IT CHECKED OUT - THEY SAID IT NEEDED A TRANSMISSION ($3700). THEY ACTED LIKE THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THESE CARS HAVING THIS TYPE OF ISSUE WHICH CONFLICTS WITH ALL OF THE INFO WHICH IS OUT THERE ON THE WEB. I GOT THE SAME STORY AT BRANDON HONDA. THE BRANDON HONDA REP STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE ISSUE & SEEMED SURPRISED THAT IT OCCURRED WHEN THE CAR ONLY HAD 65K MILES ON IT. THE PLACE WHERE I GOT IT FIXED TOLD ME ABOUT A POTENTIAL SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS EXACT SAME TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  AS FOR THE HONDA DEALERSHIPS - THEY APPEAR TO BE SHAMELESS LIARS WHO ARE IGNORING A BIG-TIME SAFETY ISSUE. IF THE CAR CAN DOWN SHIFT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU GO FROM 35 TO 60 MPH TO ABOUT 20 OR 25 MPH YOU RISK CAUSING A MAJOR ACCIDENT.  I HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HAVE SOME RECOURSE TO GET JUST COMPENSATION/REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. THESE CARS ARE NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AFTER THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM MANIFESTS ITSELF.  YOU WILL BE GAMBLING WITH YOUR LIFE (AND THAT OF OTHERS) IF YOU DRIVE  THE CAR WITH THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

I PURCHASED THE HONDA BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY STOOD BEHIND THEIR BRAND AND PRODUCED A HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCT. HOWEVER, AS A MOTHER, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR -NOR DO I ACCEPT HONDA'S LACK OF INVOLVEMENT TO PROPERLY RESOLVE. WE PLAN TO PROPERLY REPAIR AND IMMEDIATELY SELL AS I DO NOT WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY WITH THIS VEHICLE AND ITS DEMONSTRATED INFERIOR QUALITY AND RELIABILITY. *TR",

LAST WEEK, ON THURSDAY EVENING (AUGUST 26, 2010), MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR BACK FROM HER WORK ALONE AND WHILE TAKING A LEFT TURN SUDDENLY THE STEERING GOT STUCK.  SHE COULDN'T MOVE THE CAR AT ALL AND BARELY ESCAPED AN ACCIDENT WITH THE ON-COMING TRAFFIC WHICH WAS COMING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED. SHE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.  WE TOWED THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC AND IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT THE POWER STEERING PRESSURE HOSE WAS BROKEN. THE POWER STEERING PRESSURE HOSE WAS REPLACED TO FIX THIS AND IT TOOK 3 DAYS FOR THE PART TO REACH THE MECHANIC AFTER THE ORDER WAS PLACED AS THIS IS SUCH A RARE INCIDENT. I HAD TO RENT A CAR FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND. NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR AND THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED AT A HIGHER SPEED AND THE CONSEQUENCE COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

I REMOVED MY SANDAL TO BE SURE MY FOOT WAS ONLY TOUCHING THE CORRECT PEDAL AND I COULD FEEL EXACTLY THE PRESSURE I WAS PUTTING ON IT; I PUT MY SANDAL IN THE SEAT BESIDE ME.  I LIGHTLY STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN WITH MY BARE FOOT, AND AGAIN THE CAR JERKED AS IF I HAD HIT THE BRAKE HARD.  I BRAKED GENTLY AND PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER, STOPPED AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK.  AFTER I CALMED FROM THE FEAR, I SHIFTED INTO D3 TO TRY ANOTHER GEAR (RATHER THAN D).

WHILE ON VACATION THAT SUMMER I HAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRANS NOT SHIFTING INTO THIRD GEAR SO I TOOK IT TO THE NEAREST DEALER, AVALON NJ, AND HAD THEM TEST IT. AGAIN NO EVIDENCE OF A PROBLEM. I TOLD THE MECHANIC TO TAKE IT HOME WITH HIM FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS IN HOPE THAT HE WOULD FIND SOMETHING BUT NO LUCK AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN TO TWO DEALERS AND TO AAMCO AND NO ONE CAN FIND THE PROBLEM.  FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IF IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT PROBABLY ISN'T MECHANICAL. THE FACT THAT THE ON BOARD COMPUTER DOES NOT RETAIN THE CODE IS AT LEAST PART OF THE PROBLEM.  HONDA DOESN'T SEEM TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS FAILURE TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE VEHICLE, WHICH IS WHY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS I BOUGHT THE THING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

SO AFTER CALLING THE TOLL FREE HONDA AMERICA CORPORATE PEOPLE, THEY TOLD ME THAT MY CAR WAS ALREADY TAKEN INTO A HONDA DEALER AND HAD THIS 2ND GEAR REPLACED BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER. SO BASICALLY ACCORDING TO HONDA, THEY DID THEIR PART BY REPAIRING THE 2ND GEAR, AND EVEN THOUGH THE TRANSMISSION IS NOW BROKEN WITH BARELY 100,000 MILES, THERE IS NOTHING HONDA WILL DO TO COVER THE COST OF A NEW TRANSMISSION.  I REQUESTED A GOODWILL REPAIR BUT THE PERSON (REGGIE) NOR HIS SUPERVISOR MARLA FOSTER GIVE ME ANSWERS ON HOW MANY OF THESE TYPE OF CALLS WERE COMING IN OR IF THEY COULD ASSIST ME WITH THE REPAIRS.

DURING SOME COLD DAYS (EST. 12-20 DAYS) OVER THE PAST TWO WINTERS, THE CAR FAILED TO SHIFT FROM 2ND TO 3RD IN THE MORNING.  ONCE WARMED UP, THE CAR WORKED FINE.  I WAS CAREFUL TO CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID PER THE MANUAL, AND EVEN A FEW THOUSAND MILES EARLY.  I ALWAYS NOTIFIED MY MECHANIC OF THIS SYMPTOM BUT WAS TOLD NO PROBLEM COULD BE FOUND.    THE TRANSMISSION FAILED UNEXPECTEDLY ON A WARM SUMMER MORNING WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK.  THE TRANSMISSION PREVIOUSLY NEVER SLIPPED DURING WARM WEATHER.  THE FAILURE WAS QUICK, UNEXPECTED, HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING AT A HIGH SPEED, AND COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY TO MYSELF OR OTHERS.      THE FAILURE HAPPENED AFTER I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, AT WHICH POINT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING EVENTS HAPPENED ON MY WAY HOME: 1) ACCELERATE AS EXPECTED (I.E., NO FAILURE); 2) SLAM INTO A LOWER GEAR AND DECELERATE; OR 3) COAST AT CURRENT SPEED WHILE THE ENGINE REVS UP (WHICH MAY END WITH THE CAR SLAMMING INTO GEAR AND JERKING THE CAR FORWARD).      TO CORRECT THIS FAILURE, I FIRST WAS VIGILANT IN REPLACING TRANSMISSION FLUID AND ALL BUT BEGGED MY MECHANIC TO FIND THE UNDERLYING CAUSE.  THAT DIDN'T WORK.  NOW THE TRANSMISSION MUST BE REPLACED.  MY FINAL CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL BE TO BUY ONLY GERMAN ENGINEERED CARS GOING FORWARD.

AT ABOUT 80K I NOTICED IT GETTING WORSE, SO I TOLD MY MECHANIC AND HE CHANGED THE TRANNY OIL FOR ME.  IT SEEMED TO SHIFT A LITTLE BETTER AND THIS WAS ONLY FROM 2-3 GEAR THAT IT WOULD REV UP TO ABOUT 5K AND THEN JERK THE CAR TO GET INTO 3RD.  IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING AND I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING TO LOCK UP ON ME ON THE FREEWAY.  I SAW THAT CALIFORNIA FILED A SUIT AGAINST HONDA AND HONDA SETTLED.  EVERY STATE SHOULD BE FILING A SUIT - I'D BE FIRST IN LINE!  I TOO TALKED TO HONDA AND THE HQ FOR HONDA, BUT SINCE MINE HAS SO MANY MILES ON IT (ALL FREEWAY), THEY ARE BLAMING THAT, EVEN THO I HAVE MAINTENANCE RECORDS SHOWING IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM.  THEY DON'T WANT TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE.  I HOPE SOME LAWYER GETS A HOLD OF THESE COMPLAINTS AND SUES THEM LIKE CALIFORNIA DID.  THIS IS MY 2ND HONDA AND I SWORE BY IT, BUT I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HONDA AFTER THIS.  EVEN FROM DAY ONE I'VE ASKED HONDA ABOUT THE DIMMING OF THE HEADLIGHTS WHEN THE CAR SHIFTS AND THEY SAID IT WAS NORMAL CUZ THEY CAR NEEDED ALL THE POWER TO DO THE SHIFTING, SO THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I'VE OWNED SEVERAL OTHER CARS AND THIS WAS NEVER AN ISSUE.  I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE YEAR OF THIS ACCORD OR THAT IT'S A V6, BUT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AND HONDA SHOULD BE ASHAMED!  IF COMPLAINTS KEEP HAPPENING, YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD FIX THE ISSUES OR INVESTIGATE IT A LITTLE HARDER SINCE THEY ALREADY DID ONE RECALL ON THEM.  I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS NOT TO BUY HONDA AND TOLD THEM WHY.  LET'S SPREAD THE WORD AND MAYBE WHEN THEIR SALES GO DOWN, THEY MIGHT WONDER WHY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I'M NOW FACED WITH A $4K TO REBUILD MY TRANNY.  SICKENS ME, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CAR IS ONLY WORTH $7K CUZ I HAVE 140K MILES ON IT NOW.  EMAIL ME IF YOU CAN HELP SUE THEM...[XXX] .

I HAD OTHER MINOR INCIDENTS OF SLIPPAGE BUT IT WOULD QUICKLY SLIP BACK INTO GEAR. I NOW HAVE ALMOST 90,000 MILES AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUES HAPPENING RANDOMLY BUT MOSTLY WHEN THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE IS HIGH AND AT LOW SPEEDS. THE GEAR SLIPS FROM 2ND TO 3RD. FORTUNATELY FOR ME, IT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH TRAFFIC. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING DURING HEAVIER TRAFFIC TIMES, I WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I FEARED FOR MY LIFE AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DIE BEFORE THIS BECOMES A RECALL/FULL ACTION LAWSUIT FOR HONDA. THE CAR WAS JERKING TO TRY TO FIND THE GEAR AND THE FIRST THING I DID AFTER I PULLED TO THE SHOULDER WAS CALL MY WIFE AND TELL HER WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. I CALLED BRAMAN HONDA IN MIAMI, FL AND WAS GIVEN AN APPOINTMENT DATE TO BRING IT IN ON 12/6/08. AMERICAN HONDA CASE: N032008-12-0200567. THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS DIAGNOSED AND THE VEHICLE DOES NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. ALTHOUGH THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THEY WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM, THEY CALLED ME BACK TO SAY AMERICAN HONDA WAS GOING TO SPLIT THE TOTAL COST AND PAY FOR THE TRANSMISSION (GOODWILL DEED) AND I WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY THE LABOR, WHICH WAS ABOUT $1,700. I COULD NOT AFFORD THAT AND CONTINUED TRYING TO CONTACT THEM FOR A FULL REPAIR. NO LUCK. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY HONDA WITH 75,000 MILES NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION! I HAVE FOUND OUT ALMOST 1.1 MILLION 2003 V-6 ACCORDS LIKE MINE ARE AFFECTED, BUT YET NO RECALL?? HONDA REFUSES TO ADMIT THE 2003 ACCORDS HAVE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS.

THE CAR STARTED TO GO INTO CONVULSIONS, AS I COULD ONLY GUESS THE TRANSMISSION WAS TRYING TO FIND THE GEAR ONCE AGAIN. NEED I SAY, I WAS SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER WITH MY HEART RACING! I WAS THANKING GOD NOTHING HAPPENED. A SIMILAR INCIDENT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE SHORTLY AFTER THAT AND I BEGAN LOOKING UP INFORMATION REGARDING RECALLS. SURELY ENOUGH, I STUMBLED UPON THE 2003 HONDA ACCORD TRANSMISSION RECALL. I CONTACTED HONDA AND BROUGHT THE CAR TO A DEALER AS INSTRUCTED TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED. THE TRANSMISSION WAS FAULTY AND ALTHOUGH THEY DID OFFER COMPENSATION FOR HALF OF THE COST TO PUT IN A NEW TRANSMISSION, I WAS STILL NOT ABLE TO AFFORD $1,500. I FOUND IT VERY UNFAIR THAT MY ACCORD, WHICH WAS PURCHASED ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO FOR DURABILITY PURPOSES, HAD THIS ISSUE WITH ONLY 74,000 MILES. I'VE DRIVEN HONDAS FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANY. I PRESENTLY DRIVE MY ACCORD TO AND FROM WORK AND DO NOT TAKE THE EXPRESSWAY FOR FEAR OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AND MYSELF. HOWEVER, MEANING THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 1 MILLION VEHICLES WITH THIS SIMILAR PROBLEM, I THINK A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR FULL RECALL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. I CAN HONESTLY SAY IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, I WOULD HAVE SUFFERED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT THAT DAY.

THE TRUCK FOLLOWING ME WAS ABLE TO BRAKE WITHOUT HITTING ME, I HAD MY SEATBELT ON OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO THE WINDSHIELD. IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES.  I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS DRASTICALLY WRONG WITH THE CAR SO I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL.  BY THEN I WAS COASTING AT ABOUT 40 MILES AN HOUR, CARS WERE HONKING AND PASSING ME ON BOTH SIDES AND I WAS 'LOCKED IN' ON THE FREEWAY.      WHEN I PUT THE CAR BACK IN DRIVE AND ACCELERATED TO TRY TO MERGE THROUGH TRAFFIC TO GET OFF THE FREEWAY, THE TRANSMISSION SEIZED UP AGAIN, THIS TIME WITHOUT AS MUCH FORCE, IT ONLY SLOWED ME DOWN 5 MPH OR SO.  IT LOCKED UP 2 TO 3 MORE TIMES, EACH TIME WITH LESS FORCE AS I TRIED TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH SPEED TO MOVE TO THE SHOULDER.      THIS EVENT WAS PRECEDED BY SEVERAL MONTHS OF INTERMITTENT HARD DOWN SHIFTS AND ANOTHER 2 HARD DOWNSHIFTS IN A PERIOD OF A FEW HOURS TWO DAYS EARLIER.  I HAD ALREADY MADE ONE DEDICATED DEALER SERVICE CALL FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AND ANOTHER WHERE I MENTIONED IT AND BOTH TIMES I WAS TOLD HONDA KNEW OF NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION AND I WAS ADVISED NO REPAIRS WERE NEEDED.  SINCE THE EVENT I'VE LOOKED AT HONDA OWNER WEB FORUMS AND THE NHTSA SITE AND DISCOVERED THAT OTHERS WITH THE 2003 YEAR MODEL HONDA ACCORD HAVE DESCRIBED THE SAME CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THEIR TRANSMISSION WITH LOCK-UP.  IT APPEARS THAT AMERICAN HONDA HAS PAID PART OR ALL OF THE REPAIR COSTS FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE.      HONDA HAS AGREED TO PAY 50% OF MY REPAIR AND I AM IN DISCUSSION WITH THEM FOR MORE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAD SOUGHT SERVICE FOR THIS ISSUE AND HAD BEEN TOLD THERE WAS NO REPAIR NEEDED.  I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA THAT THE NHTSA HAS OR THAT AMERICAN HONDA HAS BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT OTHER 2003 ACCORD DRIVERS MAY HAVE DANGEROUS TRANSMISSIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DEADLY ACCIDENT. *TR",

IT STARTED TO DO IT AGAIN SO I PULLED OFF THE ROAM INTO A PARKING LOT.  AFTER CATCHING MY BREATH AND MY HEART SLOWING DOWN- I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY TO AT LEAST MAKE IT HOME.  WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE- THE CAR WOULD NOT REVERSE- THE GEAR WAS IN REVERSE BUT WHEN I STEPPED ON THE GAS - IT WENT FORWARD INSTEAD.  AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AN ON AGAIN AND PUTTING IN REVERSE SEVERAL TIMES IT FINALLY REVERSED.  I TRIED TO DRIVE IT HOME BECAUSE ME AND MY 2 DAUGHTERS WERE STRANDED AND DID NOT HAVE A WAY HOME. - IT SHIFTED FROM 3RD AND 4TH GEAR INTO 2ND GEAR SEVERAL TIMES - LUCKILY I HAD MADE IT TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP- THEY DIAGNOSED MY CAR (FOR 90.00!)

THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A CAR THAT IS ONLY 6YRS OLD.  THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARED ME AND MY DAUGHTERS TO THE POINT THEY WERE CRYING.  HONDA REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE THIS CHECKED OUT!

IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS, THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN SLIPPING WHEN GOING AROUND 25 - 30 MPH, MENTIONED TO HONDA DEALER AT 60,000 MILE MAINTENANCE BACK IN OCTOBER AND THEY INSPECTED AND CHANGED TRANSMISSION FLUID.   WAS OK FOR A LITTLE WHILE, BUT IN LAST FEW WEEKS, IT BEGAN SLIPPING AGAIN.  TOOK IT TO DEALER ON 4/21 AND THEY SAID THEY TESTED IT AND COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS.  THEN ON 4/22, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED WHEN GOING 60 MPH ON A HIGHWAY, IT BUCKED, AND DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR AND WOULD NOT CHANGE...IMMEDIATE SLOWING OF VEHICLE ALMOST CAUSED CAR BEHIND ME TO HIT ME.  I CRAWLED TO DEALER AND THEY TESTED AND SAID SURE ENOUGH THE TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  THE DEALER REP SAID HE WENT TO HONDA AND THAT THEY WERE ONLY GOING TO PAY 50% OF REPLACEMENT COST, BUT THEN BECAUSE THE REP PUSHED HARDER, INCREASED OFFER TO 75%.  I AGREED TO ACCEPT IT SINCE I NEED MY CAR BACK, BUT HONDA SHOULD HAVE PAID THE FULL COST.  INTERESTINGLY, I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WOULD HAVE COVERED IT ALL, BUT IT EXPIRED ON 12/28/08.  I HAVE LEARNED THOROUGH RESEARCH THAT THIS IS A RAMPANT PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND YET HONDA WILL NOT RECALL/REPLACE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT THE NHTSA MUST TAKE ACTION ON IMMEDIATELY.  THE TRANSMISSIONS IN THIS MODEL ARE FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS, AND WILL CAUSE ACCIDENTS, INJURIES AND POSSIBLE DEATH.  PLEASE TAKE ACTION SOON TO ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF ANY ACTION YOU TAKE INCLUDES REIMBURSING THOSE OF US WHO HAD TO PAY TO GET A NEW OR REBUILT TRANSMISSION INSTALLED. *TR",

THE DEALER CHOOSE THE OPTION OF INSTALLING AN OIL JET KIT AS THE RECOMMENDED REPAIR FOR MY 2003 ACCORD.

IN MY RESEARCH THIS TRANSMISSION FAILURE ON THIS YEAR HONDA WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IS WIDELY KNOWN AND ONE THAT HONDA WILL PROVIDE SOME REIMBURSEMENT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. THE ISSUE I HAVE IS IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WHY DID HONDA NOT RECALL IT? A LESS EXPERIENCED DRIVER (OR MAYBE I WAS JUST LUCKY) COULD HAVE SUFFERED SERIOUS INJURIES. HONDA TOUTS ITS RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AND FOR THAT I PURCHASED THEIR CAR, HOWEVER, THAT IN MY OPINION WAS A LIE.

I HAVE A 2003 ACCORD AND I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR 1 YEAR AND ALREADY THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING. I FOUND OUT THAT I NEED ANOTHER TRANSMISSION. MY CAR HAS 102,000 AND PAST THE WARRANTY OF I THINK 36-46,000 MILES WARRANTY. I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA AND I WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR RECEIVED A OIL JECT KIT IN 2004 AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS FINE. NOW, IF SOME REPAIR WAS DONE ON MY CAR IN 2004, THEN WHY HAS MY TRANSMISSION GONE OUT. IT SADDENS ME THAT HONDA AND NHTSA KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM BUT NOTHING IS BEING DONE. I DON'T WANT MY FAMILY TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE MY CHILDREN AND I WERE KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT FROM BEING HIT FROM BEHIND.  I HAVE HAD SO MANY CLOSE CALLS THAT I HAD TO PULL OVER AND CRY BECAUSE I WAS SO UPSET. I WAS TOLD THAT I AM PROBABLY GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THIS FIXED AND LORD KNOWS I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY! HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING. A COMPANY KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND STAND BY AND LEAVE THEIR VALUED CUSTOMERS ON A BRANCH ALONE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A HONDA TO ANY ONE. THEY BRAG ABOUT THEIR CAR BUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HONDA IS NOT BACKING IT UP! I AM LOOKING INTO TALKING TO A LAWYER ABOUT THIS DEAL!  *TR",

        "summary": "JUST AN FYI. I AM DOING MY PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NHTSA IS AWARE OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY PROBLEM WITH THE 2003 HONDA ACCORD V6. THE CAR IS A EPIDEMIC TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, WHICH HONDA RECALLED IN 2004 BUT THEY DID NOT REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. THEIR BAND-AID RECALL ONLY RESULTED IN A DELAYING OF THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 60,000 MILES, A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE ACCORD V6 TRANSMISSIONS FAIL. HERE IS ONE OF DOZENS OF WEBSITES DETAILING THE PROBLEM: HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/HONDA/ACCORD/2003/TRANSMISSION/TRANSMISSION_FAILURE.SHTML    THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR WILL NOT SHIFT INTO 2ND OR 3RD GEAR WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE ON THE FREEWAY. IT THEN RESORTS TO SHIFTING TO 1ST GEAR AT 60MPH, WHICH CAUSES THE ENGINE RPM TO SOAR TO 7000 RPM, LOCKING THE FRONT (DRIVE) WHEELS MOMENTARILY AND CAUSING A HEAVY DECELERATION OF THE VEHICLE. THIS ALL HAPPENS WHEN THE DRIVER WAS ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE, AND CAN BE CAUSE OF A REAR END COLLISION. I IMPLORE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO DO SOME RESEARCH INTO THIS MATTER, AS HONDA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM. THEY ARE INSTALLING RE-BUILT TRANSMISSIONS INTO THE CARS AND OFFERING A PERCENTAGE \"GOOD WILL\" MONEY TOWARDS THE REPAIR. HOWEVER, THIS IS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS, AND MANY OWNERS ARE LEFT WITH LITTLE TO NO ASSISTANCE. HONDA ADMITS TO THEIR TRANSMISSIONS FROM 1999 TO 2001'S BEING DEFECTIVE, BUT THEY WILL NOT ADMIT TO THEIR 2002-2004 TRANSMISSION HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS ISSUE IS ONLY PREVALENT ON THE V6 MODELS.  *TR",

I WAS ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY WITH HEAVY TRAFFIC. I AM NOT SURE HOW I WASN'T INJURED MORE.   HONDA SAID THE REPAIR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOT COVERED. THE CAR HAD AN EARLIER RECALL FOR THE TRANSMISSION AROUND 20,000 MILES FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THEY TRIED TO SAY THEY WOULDN'T COVER IT.     THE CORPORATE OFFICE WANTED TO KNOW IF I PLANNED ON BUYING A HONDA AGAIN. WHEN I SAID NO, THEY SAID \"WE MIGHT WAS WELL STOP RIGHT HERE AS THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY FOR LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMERS\" (I HAD BOUGHT 3 HONDA'S PREVIOUSLY, AMAZING WHAT THEY CALLED \"LOYAL\")  TWO DAYS LATER HONDA CALLED BACK AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION AND PART OF THE CAR RENTAL WOULD BE COVERED.     THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS MODEL YEAR HONDA FOR THE TRANSMISSION, BUT YET IT SEEMS HONDA IS NOT GOING TO RECALL THE TRANSMISSION. I AM CONCERNED THERE COULD BE AND MAY HAVE BEEN SERIOUS IF NOT DEADLY ACCIDENTS RELATED TO THIS MALFUNCTION, THAT MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.     I AM WONDERING IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND ALREADY INVESTIGATING CRASHES INVOLVING THE HONDA 2003 ACCORD.  *TR",

THE DEALER TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE ROTORS TURNED AND NEW PADS INSTALLED, AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME ALMOST $200.  THE DEALER DID NOT TELL ME HONDA ISSUED A SERVICE TSB (TSB# 03-069) REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THAT THE SERVICE SHOULD BE DONE UNDER WARRANTY PER HONDA.

IT ALL STARTED WITH THE YELLOW TRACTION CONTROL TRIANGLE LIGHTING UP, RIGHT AFTER WE BOUGHT THE CAR. NO SYMPTOMS, JUST SOLID NON-BLINKING LIGHT ON DASH. DEALER HAD NO SOLUTION. THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE WHEN MY WIFE NOTICED THAT THE CAR'S TRANSMISSION SEEMED TO \"BOG DOWN\". I NEVER EXPERIENCED IT, JUST MY WIFE. DEALER SAID THIS WAS JUST THE TRACTION CONTROL KICKING IN, NO SOLUTION.  LAST JULY, 4 HOURS FROM HOME, THE CAR SUDDENLY BOGGED DOWN ON ME, I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED DOWN AT THE DASH... THE CAR WAS TRAVELING 70 MPH, THE SPEEDOMETER WAS DEAD, THE ENGINE WAS DEAD, I HAPPENED TO BE AT AN EXIT RAMP, SO I COASTED OFF THE INTERSTATE TO A STOP. I CALLED THE DEALER IN THE NEAREST CITY, AND THEY SAID TO RESTART THE CAR, I DID, AND IT RAN. I TOOK THE CAR TO AUTO ZONE WHERE THEY SAID THE CODE WAS \"SPEED CONTROL SENSOR/SHORT\".  DEALER CHECKED IT, AND SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH SENSOR.  THEY BLAMED IT ON HAVING TOO MUCH TRANSMISSION FLUID IN THE TRANSMISSION.     A FEW TIMES SINCE JULY, THE CAR HAS MYSTERIOUSLY GONE DEAD IN TRAFFIC, NOTABLY WHILE IN THE TURN LANE.      2 WEEKS AGO, THE RED BRAKE LIGHT STARTED COMING ON.  AN ISOLATED AND SEPARATE ISSUE I THINK.     LAST WEEK, I DROVE 1 HOUR TO THE AIRPORT. THE TRACTION CONTROL AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AND EVERY TIME I USED THE TURN INDICATOR, THE CAR DIED. IT RESTARTED ITSELF  AS SOON AS THE TURN INDICATOR WAS RELEASED IF MOVING FAST ON ROAD. WHILE LOOPING AROUND THE AIRPORT TERMINAL, IT STALLED SEVERAL TIMES AS I TESTED TO SEE IF THE TURN SIGNAL STILL KILLED IT, HAVING TO SHIFT TO NEUTRAL AND RESTART, AS THE CAR WAS IDLING WHEN IT STALLED THIS TIME.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF TO LOAD BAGS, AND WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, NO SYMPTOMS, AND IT HAS NOT DONE IT SINCE LAST WEEK. THE DEALER COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM, AGAIN NO SOLUTION.  *JB",

THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED A FEW ACCIDENTS, BUT THE DEALERSHIP CAN FIND NO PROBLEM.  LAST THURSDAY MY CAR SEEMED TO BE HESITATING BEFORE SHIFTING INTO EITHER 2ND OR 3RD.  I COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE.  LATER THAT NIGHT, THE CAR BEGAN TO JUMP INTO & OUT OF THE LOW GEARS WHILE STARTING & STOPPING AT LIGHTS.  I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE IN REVERSE (ONLY REV UP).  AFTER SOME TIME, THE CAR JUMPED INTO REVERSE AND BACK INTO A DITCH.  AFTER GETTING BACK ON THE ROAD, TRAVELING APPROX 60 MILES PER HR, I EASED OFF THE ACCELERATOR, THE CAR POWERFULLY DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR.  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SEAT BELT, I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED.  MY DOG WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME & THROWN INTO THE DASH, THEN THE FLOOR.  THE TIRES BARKED.  THE CAR THEN SUDDENLY UP SHIFTED TO A HIGHER GEAR.  I MADE IT HOME THAT NIGHT AND DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT MORNING.  THE CAR SEEMED TO BE DOING OK.  I ARRIVED AND WAS TOLD TO MAKE AN APT FOR NEXT WEEK. LESS THEN 10 MILES AWAY THE CAR WOULD NO LONGER SHIFT OUT OF 3RD GEAR AND THEN WOULD NOT GO IN REVERSE.  I DROVE IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  I WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AT MY EXPENSE, AND I WAS PRETTY MUCH AT FAULT BECAUSE I HAD NOT COMPLETED ALL MY SERVICE AT HONDA.  I EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE IT TO THEM DURING THEIR BUSINESS HOURS.  SO, SOME OF MY NORMAL OIL CHANGES WERE DONE AT OTHER LUBE CENTERS. I THEN ASKED HIM ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION RECALL AND HE SAID THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY PROBLEM.  AFTER WAITING MORE THAN  HR WHILE HE CUT UP WITH EMPLOYEES, I SPOKE TO THE LOCATION MANAGER AND ASKED ABOUT TEMPORARY TRANSPORTATION UNTIL I COULD CONTACT AMERICAN HONDA, AND HE SUGGESTED I BUY A NEW CAR.   *JB",

THE BRAKES HAVE ALWAYS FELT SOFT AND THE NOISES CONTINUE, THOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE THE DEALER EVER CHECKED THE ROTORS OR DID A PROPER INSPECTION.  NOW AT 26,400 MILES THE PEDAL FEELS LIKE A SPONGE AND I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO CHECK THE BRAKES AGAIN.  SOMETIMES THE BRAKES GRAB VERY HARD, SOMETIMES THEY SEEM NOT TO GRAB AT ALL.  HONDA NEEDS TO RECALL THE CARS OR PROVIDE FREE BRAKE INSPECTIONS TO INSURE THE CAR WILL STOP AS EXPECTED.  THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN AND OTHERS HAVE ALSO COMPLAINED OF THE SAME PROBLEMS.  THE BRAKES HAVE NOT COMPLETELY FAILED, BUT WE HAVE HAD TO ASSUME THEY WILL NOT STOP THE CAR AS THEY  WERE ADVERTISED, IN A REASONABLE DISTANCE RELATIVE TO SPEED.  NO PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED OR CORRECTIVE MEASURE COMPLETED DESPITE SEVERAL REQUESTS TO THE DEALER (MOST WHILE THE CAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER WARRANTY). *NM",

IT WAS A HONDA CERTIFIED CAR WHICH MEANS IT HAD BEEN 150 POINT INSPECTED BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.  THE CAR HAS JUST OVER 60K MILES.  THE TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT THIS PAST WEEKEND AFTER ONLY 3 WEEKS.  WAS THIS PROBLEM MISSED IN THE 150 POINT INSPECTION....I THINK SO.  I CHECKED BY 150 POINT INSPECTION PAPER AFTER THE PROBLEM OCCURRED.  IT SEEMS THAT THE TRANSMISSION LEAK BOX WAS NOT EVER CHECKED.  THEY MUST HAVE LEFT THAT PART OUT.  WHICH MEANS THE HONDA WAS NOT CERTIFIED, AND WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT IT WAS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT TO THE CONSUMER THAT THIS WAS A HONDA CERTIFIED CAR.  WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS AN ANGRY INDIVIDUAL.  I WAS BASICALLY LIED TO IN ORDER TO GET THE SELL.  THANKFULLY, I BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE FIX IS IN WORKS NOW.  AFTER READING OTHER PEOPLE'S HORROR STORIES WITH THEIR TRANSMISSION, I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND HONDA AS A COMPANY.  I AM VERY ANGRY THAT AFTER 3 WEEKS OF HAVING MY CAR, IT IS IN THE SHOP TO BE FIXED.  I WAS LIED TO AND DECEIVED.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO PREVENT THIS TO HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE THEN I WILL BY ALL MEANS DO SO.  THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.   *JB",

THEN AGAIN AT 15,000 MILES I NOTICED THAT WHEN I APPLY BRAKES AT 60MPH MY CAR VIBRATES AND ON WET ROADS IT SLIPS/SKIDS. THIS ALSO HAPPENS ON CURVES AT SPEED OF 30 MPH IN WET CONDITIONS. ROSENTHAL HONDA AT TYSONS CORNER IN VIRGINIA HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE STARTED HAPPENING AT 15,000 MILES. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY NEED TO RESURFACE MY ROTORS AND REPLACE MY PADS AND THAT THE PROBLEM WILL BE GONE. I ASK THEM TO PROCEED WITH IT AND NOW THE PROBLEM CAME UP AGAIN AT 18,000 MILES. ROSENTHAL AGAIN RESURFACE THE ROTARS AND TOLD ME THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED. TODAY AT 20,000 MILES THE SAME PROBLEM COMES UP. ROSENTHAL & HONDA ARE TELLING ME THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM BUT I KNOW THAT MY BRAKES ARE NOT WORKING RIGHT AND NOT THE WAY HOINDA HAS DESIGNED IT TO WORK. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO GO.

UPON ARRIVAL AT OUR DESTINATION I CALLED PERFORMANCE HONDA IN FAIRFIELD OHIO, THE DEALER NEAREST OUR DESTINATION, AND RELAYED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  I WAS INSTRUCTED TO BRING THE CAR IN THE NEXT MORNING, THURSDAY JUNE 17, SO THE DEALERSHIP COULD INSPECT THE CAR AND ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHY THE SIDE AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELT DEPLOYED WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.*AK    BY TUESDAY, JUNE 22 WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD KNOW WHAT HONDA WOULD DO AND WE COULD COME IN AND PICK UP THE CAR.  WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE DEALERSHIP WE WERE ADVISED THAT HONDA ENGINEERS BELIEVED WE HAD STRUCK SOMETHING, BASED ON A VERY SMALL SCRATCH IN THE UNDERCOATING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, AND THAT CAUSED THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAGS.  WE PICKED UP THE CAR AND RETURNED HOME TO FORT WAYNE ON WEDNESDAY.    THURSDAY  MORNING , JUNE 24 WE SPOKE IN PERSON WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER OF DON AYRES HONDA WHERE WE HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  WE EXPRESSED OUR POSITION THAT THE AIRBAGS AND SEAT BELT SHOULD NOT HAVE DEPLOYED AND HONDA SHOULD MAKE ALL REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY.

BEFORE LOOKING AT CAR SERVICE REP TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY DUE TO MY DRIVING HABITS (LOTS OF STOP AND GO). I HAVE HAD THE SAME COMMUTE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF PROBLEM BEFORE. I SAID I'D BE VERY UNHAPPY IF I HAD TO REPLACE THE BRAKES AT 18,000 MILES. SERVICE REP SAID IT WAS VERY COMMON TO REPLACE BRAKES AND ROTORS AT 18,000 MILES. I REITERATED MY UNHAPPINESS IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  I BELIEVED IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER INSPECTING THE BRAKES I WAS TOLD THE FRONT ROTORS WERE GLAZED AND THE PAD WERE CRACKED.  THEY RESURFACED THE ROTORS (THAT'S TWICE IN 10,000 MILES) AND REPLACED THE PADS UNDER WARRANTY AS A \"ONE TIME COURTESY\".  THE PROBLEM CAME BACK WITHIN 7 DAYS OF THE REPAIR. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO TAKE MY CAR BACK TODAY ( 4 WEEKS TO THE DAY SINCE THEY WORKED ON IT).  I BELIEVE THE ROTORS ARE DEFECTIVE OR HAVE BEEN RESURFACED TOO MUCH AND NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I AM EXPECTING THAT THEY WILL TRY TO TELL ME THIS IS SOMEHOW MY FAULT AND EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  I BELIEVE FROM READING ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS WHICH ARE SO SIMILAR TO MINE, THAT THE 2003 HONDA ACCORDS HAVE A BRAKE PROBLEM THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT WANT TO ADDRESS.*AK",

NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY DID ADMIT TO FINDING A BULLETIN FOR THE HONDA ACCORDS STATING THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS NEED TO BE CHANGED AND THEY NEED TO SEAL LEAKS IN THE CAR.

THE DRIVING CONDITIONS WERE EXCELLENT, SKIES WERE CLEAR, ROADS WERE DRY AND TEMPERATURES WERE MODERATE.  WHILE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 55 MPH, TWO OF THE SIDE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED APPARENTLY WITHOUT PROVOCATION.  TWO SENSORS ACTIVATED TWO SEPARATE AIRBAGS: THE SIDE-CURTAIN AIRBAG AND THE SEAT-CUSHION AIRBAG.  FORTUNATELY, NEITHER OCCUPANT WAS HURT BUT MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF ONTO A SIDE STREET.  THEY SURVEYED THE AREA AND NOTICED THAT THERE WERE NO POTHOLES OR ROCKS IN THE ROAD AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT THEY COULD HAVE COLLIDED WITH.  THEY ALSO LOOKED FOR DAMAGE TO THE CAR. THERE WAS NONE. COINCIDENTALLY, I WAS CALLING MY WIFE AS SHE WAS PULLING THE CAR ONTO THE SIDE STREET.  SHE ASKED WHAT SHE SHOULD DO.  I SAID THAT I WOULD MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS AND GET BACK TO HER.  AFTER SEVERAL CALLS TO BOTH AUTO WEST HONDA AND HONDA MOTORS, I WAS INFORMED THAT AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT WAS NOT CONSIDERED A WARRANTEE PROBLEM AND THEREFORE TOWING WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

THE DEALER?S REPRESENTATIVE, JOHN DAVIS, ADVISED ME THAT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HAVING NO AIRBAG RESTRAINTS, THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.  WE ELECTED TO HAVE MY WIFE DRIVE IT IN TO AUTO WEST.

I TOOK MY CAR INTO HONDA AND THEY ROTATED MY TIRES TELLING ME THAT THE PROBLEM WASN'T AN ALIGNMENT ISSUE BUT BALANCING OF THE TIRES.  I DROVE MY CAR AND REALIZED THAT IS WAS PULLING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD, I TOOK MY CAR IN AGAIN AND THEY RE-ROTATED AND BALANCED MY TIRES.  AFTER THAT, MY CAR STARTED PULLING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. I THEN TOOK MY CAR IN AGAIN STATING THAT I WANTED TO HAVE THE TIRES CHECKED OUT AS IT APPEARED THAT THE PROBLEM FOLLOWED THE TIRES.  THEY SAID THE TIRES WERE FINE AND THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF IN MY FRONT SUSPENSION THAT THEY RE-ADJUSTED.  I DROVE MY CAR AFTER THE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCOVER THAT THE CAR STILL PULLED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. I TOOK IT IN YET AGAIN AND DROVE WITH A MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR ALL 2003 ACCORDS TO PULL TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT THEY COULD DO AS MY CAR WAS WITHIN THEIR SPECIFICATIONS.  NOT BEING SATISFIED I KEPT REQUESTING TO SPEAK TO MORE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE HONDA ORGANIZATION ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY WOULD DO NOTHING MORE, THAT PULLING TO THE RIGHT IS NORMAL ON ALL CARS.     I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER THAT HONDA HAD GIVEN ME AND I WANTED TO RAISE THIS ISSUE TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AS I THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS RISK IF MY CAR IS PULLING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD.

MY ONLY CONCERN WAS THAT THE VEHICLE WAS A FIRST YEAR REDESIGNED MODEL, BUT WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER HE SAID THAT THE ONLY THING CHANGED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2003 WAS THAT THE VEHICLE HAD HIGH COMPRESSION HEADS AND THAT'S WHERE THE EXTRA HORSEPOWER CAME FROM. I STILL HAD SOME RESERVATIONS, HOWEVER I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, \"IT'S A HONDA HOW CAN I GO WRONG?\"  SEVEN DAYS AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR IT STRANDED MY WIFE AT WORK. SHE FINALLY GOT THE CAR STARTED AFTER 20 MINUTES AND GOT IT HOME AND TOLD ME IT WOULDN'T CRANK. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A FLUCK AND IT WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN, 6 DAYS LATER IT DID IT AGAIN. I NOW THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS THE SECURITY CHIP IN HER KEY CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO SHUT OFF THE FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM, SO I TOLD HER WE WOULD GET HER A NEW KEY. FIVE DAYS LATER USING MY KEY THE CAR FAILED TO CRANK. I CONTINUED TO HOLD THE KEY OVER TO SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FINALLY CRANK AND IT TOOK 45 SECONDS OF CONTINUAL CRANKING FOR THE CAR TO FINALLY FIRE OFF! THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN AND SO I DID. THE DEALERSHIP WAS VERY HELPFUL AND CONCERNED AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO FIX MY CAR, HOWEVER PARTS WERE ON BACK-ORDER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT. THEY GAVE US A RENTAL CAR AND SENT US HOME. IT TOOK HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION 27 DAYS TO DELIVER OUR PART AND WHEN WE GOT THE CAR BACK THE NEXT DAY IT ACTED UP AGAIN SO THE CAR WENT BACK INTO THE SHOP FOR ANOTHER 7 DAYS. THE DEALERSHIP HAS COMPLETELY REPLACED THE ENTIRE FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE CAR STILL FAILS TO CRANK ABOUT TWICE A MONTH.

THEIR RESPONSE WAS THAT THE GAS I WAS USING HAD A HIGH SULFUR CONTENT AND  WE MUST SWITCH GAS STATIONS IMMEDIATELY TO GET RID OF THE SMELL. SO I TRIED EVERY GAS STATION IN THE AREA AND THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE. THE CAR STARTED TO SHAKE AND SEEMED TO BE DRAWING POWER FROM THE ENGINE. THE IDLE WOULD ALSO RISE AND FALL WHEN THIS SHAKING IS HAPPENING. THE ODOR BECAME WORSE WHEN THE SHAKING WOULD START. THIS SMELL IS GIVING ME A BIG HEADACHE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. SO I CALLED HONDA SERVICE TO PUT THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE AGAIN. HONDA DID NOT EVEN WANT TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN, BUT WITH MUCH YELLING I GOT AN APPOINTMENT. THEY HAD THE CAR ALL DAY AND WHEN MY WIFE CALLED TO SEE IF THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THEY CONTINUED TO EXPLAIN THAT IT IS (THE NATURE OF THE BEAST) AND ALL CARS PUT OFF THIS SMELL TO SOME DEGREE.  I ALSO NOTICED THE GAS MILEAGE IS NOT WHAT HONDA STATED IT SHOULD BE. SO I CALLED HONDA DIRECTLY TO FILE A COMPLAINT AND FOUND OUT THAT HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, BUT HAS NO SOLUTIONS TO FIX IT. HONDA ASSURES ME THAT AFTER 10,000 TO 15,000 MILES GOES BY THAT THE SMELL WILL DECREASE AND GO AWAY. THIS SMELL STARTED AT 50 MILES AND IS GETTING MUCH WORSE AT 4,500 MILES.

THE TWISTS AND TURNS TOOK AWAY SOME OF THE MOMENTUM AND WHEN I HAD GONE ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY DOWN THE ONE WAY STREET, I YANKED UP THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED.

THE FACT THAT THE BRAKES ARE NOW WORKING DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BRAKES ARE GOOD.  MY DAUGHTER AND I CAN TESTIFY TO THAT FACT BECAUSE WE WERE THE ONES WHO FACED THAT NEAR DEATH SITUATION AND I REFUSE TO TAKE A CHANCE WITH OUR LIVES.  THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE BRAKES AND I WOULD HATE TO START SEEING REPORTS OF FATALITIES CAUSED BY THIS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DID NOT DO EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TESTS TO FIND AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE DEALER IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT SINCE THEY CAN'T FIND A PROBLEM, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT THE TAKE THE CAR BACK.

READ ME A PREPARED STATEMENT THAT THE 2003 ACCORDS HAVE A PROBLEM IN RELEASING HYDROGEN SULFIDE DUE TO DESIGN, IT IS NOT THE GASOLINE.  NO TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS HAS BEEN RELEASED.  THERE IS NO FIX.  HONDA CLAIMS THE PROBLEM SHOULD GO AWAY OR DISSIPATE SOMETIME BETWEEN 3000-5000 MILES.  I HAVE 3950 MILES AND THE SMELL IS AWFUL.  HONDA WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP.  ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC), HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM POISON!    BREATHING HIGH LEVELS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE CAN CAUSE DEATH WITHIN JUST A FEW BREATHS! EXPOSURE TO LOWER CONCENTRATIONS CAN RESULT IN EYE IRRITATION, A SORE THROAT, COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND FLUID IN THE LUNGS.  I HAVE BEEN SHOWING SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS.  WHY HAS NHTSA DONE NOTHING ON THIS ISSUE?  THE PROBLEM MUST BE WIDE-SPREAD AS HONDA HAS A PREPARED STATEMENT FOR ITS REPS TO READ OVER THE PHONE.  I WILL ATTEMPT A LEMON LAW CLAIM AND/OR CIVIL ACTION FOR DAMAGES DUE TO INJURIES FROM EXPOSURE TO THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE.  (INCIDENT DATE DOES NOT APPLY AS THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN CONSTANT). *JB",

I NEEDED TO BRAKE TO RESTRAIN THE VEHICLE. THE TACHOMETER WENT TO 6000 RPM AND STAYED STEADY THE ENTIRE TIME PUTTING THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL   AS I PREPARED TO KILL THE IGNITION RETURNED CONTROL AND THE VEHICLE RESUMED RESPONDING.  I HAVE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND AM GETTING A RESPONSE FROM THE DEALER THAT THEY HAVE FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. I AM A 47 Y/O MALE WITH 30 YEARS DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND AM QUITE SURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
