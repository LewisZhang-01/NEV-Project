YOU CAN NOT CHECK THE TRANSMISSION FLUID BECAUSE THERE IS NO DIP STICK YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL TO HAVE THAT DONE.  THE AIR CONDITIONER COMES ON OFF WHENEVER, WHEN YOU PUT GAS IN THE CAR YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT GAS BEFORE IT WILL STAY RUNNING.

I WILL NEVER NEVER BUY A CHEVROLET AGAIN LET ALONE A MALIBU.  MY NEXT CAR WILL BE A HONDA.  I AM STILL TAKING THE CAR BACK FOR THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM THIS WILL BE THE 4TH TIME IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

THIS ENGINE REQUIRES HIGH FUEL PUMP PRESSURE (55 - 60 PSI), WHICH REQUIRES HIGH ELECTRICAL CURRENT FOR THE PUMP, PARTICULARLY UNDER CONDITIONS OF HIGH FUEL DEMAND, SUCH AS TOWING (THE CIRCUIT HAS A 20 AMP FUSE).

WAITED 1 1/2 HRS TO LET ENGINE COOL DOWN.  REMOVED RADIATOR CAP.  RADIATOR WAS DRY.  I ASKED THE GAS STATION FOR THE RECOMMENDED  BRAND 'DEX-COOL'.  FORTUNATELY, THEY DIDN'T CARRY THAT BRAND.  (THE REPORTS I'VE READ TODAY, INDICATE BRAND DEX-COOL COOLANT IS THE #1 CAUSE IN GASKET CORROSIONS, IT EATS PLASTIC.  ADDED A 50/50 COOLANT AND ARRIVED HOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A REPUTABLE MECHANIC.  AFTER GIVING HIM A VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE'D EXPERIENCED THE EVENING PRIOR, HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED ME IN MID-SENTENCE AND SAID \"VICKIE, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FINISH TELLING ME.  I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  IT'S COMMON FOR THIS ENGINE IN CHEVY'S FROM 1996 - 1999 TO LEAK COOLANT FROM THE INTAKE MANIFOLD NEAR THE REAR FIREWALL\"  HE WENT ON TO SAY, THAT THEIR SERVICE CENTER HAS HAD MANY CUSTOMERS COME IN WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT FREQUENTLY.  HE ESTIMATED THE COST TO REPLACE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET IS BETWEEN $250 - $300.  IF THIS IS SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM, THEN GM SHOULD NOT ONLY BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE OWNERS, BUT SHOULD ASSIST IN THE COST TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE GASKETS.  THE MECHANIC ALSO STATED, IF THE FLUID ENTERS THE ENGINE, WHICH COULD VERY WELL HAPPEN, THEN THE ENGINE WOULD LOCK-UP.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AND CAN EASILY BE PREVENTED.  NEED THERE BE A FATALITY BEFORE GM VOLUNTARILY NOTIFIES THE OWNERS AND RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM?  I DEMAND THAT GM INFORM CURRENT OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM, REIMBURSE OWNERS WHO'VE ALREADY PAID TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED, AND FINALLY, STOP RECOMMENDING THE USE OF DEX-COOL BRAND COOLANT IN THE OWNERS MANUAL!!!        *AK",

ALL FOUR OCCUPANTS OF THE TAHOE WERE WEARING SAFETY BELTS WITH SHOULDER HARNRESS.  MY SON WAS SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED THE 60/40 REAR SEAT TO SHIFT A FRACTION OF AN INCH ALLOWING THE SEATBELT HARNESS TO RELEASE WHERE IT ATTACHES BELOW THE SEAT.  WHEN THE SEATBELT CAME APART HE WAS THROWN TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND HIS FOOT WENT THROUGH THE BROKEN SIDE REAR WINDOW.

THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A NEW VEHICLE, LET ALONE ONE THAT COSTS AS MUCH AS THE TAHOE.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS GOING TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE WAS NOT STOPPING VERY GOOD, ESPECIALLY AT A SPEED GREATER THAN 40 MPH.  THE BRAKES WERE BLED IN THE SUMMER OF 1999. THAT SEEMED TO HELP FOR A WHILE. BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO REAPPEAR.  WE TOOK THE TRUCK BACK TO OUR DEALER.  THEY THEN REPLACED THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER. THAT SEEMED TO HELP.  BUT I FEEL THE BRAKE SYSTEM STILL IS NOT A GOOD SYSTEM WHEN YOU MUST PRESS THE PEDAL DOWN SO FAR TO GET A GOOD STOP.  THE MANIFOLD GASKETS ALSO HAD TO ALREADY BE REPLACED. FOR A FAIRLY NEW AND EXPENSIVE VEHICLE, WE HAVE HAD ALOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE. (WE HAD A 1995 CHEVY SUBURBAN BEFORE, AND WE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.  WE REALLY LIKED THE BRAKING SYSTEM ON IT AND WISH WE HAD NEVER TRADED FOR THE TAHOE.)  ONE THING I NOTICED ON YOUR RECALLS, ON THE 1998 TAHOES, THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE ROTORS AND BRAKING SYSTEM.  SINCE OUR TRUCK WAS BUILT EARLY IN MAY 1998, AND LISTED AS 1999, COULD WE HAVE POSSIBLY INHERITED THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THE 1998 TAHOE? I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A 2000 TAHOE, BUT HESITATE BECAUSE OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM THEY MAY HAVE. PLEASE INFORM ME IF THERE COULD BE A RECALL ON OUR MODEL AND YEAR. I FEEL THE 1998 RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO THE 1999 SINCE EVERYTHING ON THE VEHICLES ARE THE SAME.  *AK",

WE WERE TOLD TO BE @ COURTESY ON 6/14/99, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A MACHINE THAT WOULD PINPOINT THE SOURCE OF THE VIBRATION.

FIRST OF ALL, WE SPENT MORE THAN THE STICKER PRICE AND HAD THE ADD-ONS TAKEN OFF WITH NO CREDIT GIVEN TO US FOR THAT. SECOND OF ALL WE WERE TOLD THIS WAS A NEW VEHICLE W/ ONLY A FEW MILES ON IT. AFTER WE GOT IN THE TRUCK TO GO HOME(AFTER IT WAS PAID FOR), WE NOTICE THAT THE VEHICLE HAD 732 MILES ON IT!!! THEY SOLD A DAMAGED DEMO AS A NEW VEHICLE.
