MY MECHANIC STATED THE PART ALONE WILL COST OVER $300 DOLLARS.

THE LIGHT STAYED ON FOR 1 WEEK AND THEN WENT OFF.  THIRTY DAYS LATER, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND STAYED ON FOR 1 WEEK AND THEN WENT OFF.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE WILLIAMS FAMILY AUTO MALL DEALERSHIP (WHERE I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE CAR AND HAVE HAD MY CAR SERVICED) TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  THEY TOLD ME THE ANTI LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT WILL COST ME $3,200 TO FIX.  THE CAR HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT.  I DECLINED HAVING THIS FIXED BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO REPAIR THE CAR.  IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST, THE THREE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN AND HAVE STAYED ON SINCE THEM.  NOW THAT I SEE THE RECALL NOTICE FOR GM'S TRUCKS AND SUV'S WITH ANTI LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM PROBLEMS I WANTED TO SEE IF MY PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO THE RECALL.  I ALSO WANTED TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYWAY I CAN HAVE MY CAR REPAIRED ALONG WITH THIS RECALL NOTICE.  ITS NOT RIGHT FOR SUCH A SYSTEM TO GO OUT WITH 80,000 MILES.  IN AUGUST 2005, I ALSO HAS THE POWER STEERING GO OUT ON ALL LEFT TURNS.  THIS WAS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND I HAD TO PAY $1,000 TO HAVE THIS FIXED.  THIS ALSO HAPPENED AT 80,000 MILES AND AGAIN, IN MY OPINION, SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT.  I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE I COULD NOT MAKE ANY LEFT TURNS WITH THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR AN ESTIMATE WHICH WAS $2,300 WHO SAID THE \"RACK\" WAS OUT.  I THEN TOOK IT TO A LOCAL GARAGE, DEMPSEYS, AND THEY SAID THE \"PINION\" PART OF THE STEERING WAS OUT.  I HAD THE CAR FIXED AT DEMPSEYS FOR $1,000 WITH REFURBISHED PARTS AND THE PROBLEM IS FIXED. *JB",
