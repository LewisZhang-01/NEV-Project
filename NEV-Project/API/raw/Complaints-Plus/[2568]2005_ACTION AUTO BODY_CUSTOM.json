AFTER CONTACTING MANUFACTURE I SENT HIM PICTURES. HE BASICALLY TOLD ME ITS NOT HIS PROBLEM. I HAD THE BIKE TOWED TO A REPUTABLE SHOP AND THEY SAID THE DOWN TUBE SHOULD BE THICKER WITH LARGER GUSSETING OR SUPPORT RODS BECAUSE OF THE RAKE OF THE CHASSIS. IF FRAME CRACKED ALL THE WAY THE FRONT FORKS WOULD HAVE RIPPED MY HEAD OFF. THE BIKE IS NOT LISTED IN YOUR SELECTION. IT'S A 2005 PHANTOM CHOPPER. MODEL DEVASTATOR 300. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT HE DESIGNED IT AND HE WAS WARNED THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BREAK. *TR",
