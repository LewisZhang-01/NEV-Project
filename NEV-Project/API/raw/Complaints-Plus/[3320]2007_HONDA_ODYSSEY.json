I MAINTAINED STEERING CONTROL, REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL, THEN SUDDENLY THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED RAPIDLY WITHOUT MY PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 60 SECONDS. I'M STATING THIS MILDLY WHEN I SAY THE EXPERIENCE WAS TERRIFYING. I PULLED OVER, TURNED THE CAR OFF, AND CALLED OUR MECHANIC WHO ADVISED I SLOWLY AND SAFELY DRIVE THE VAN TO THE SHOP, WHICH WASN'T TOO FAR AWAY, OR CONSIDER HAVING IT TOWED. I CHOSE TO DRIVE SLOWLY TO THE MECHANICS AND THE PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR AGAIN. UPON DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, OUR MECHANIC SAID IT WAS A STEERING SENSOR THAT LOST ITS MEMORY AND NEEDED RESET, AN EASY FIX AND THAT WHILE THIS PROBLEM IS RARE, IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF, YET IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. (WE HAD RECENTLY HAD NEW TIRES INSTALLED PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED THAT WHILE THE TIRES WERE BEING CHANGED, THE SENSOR'S MEMORY MUST HAVE BEEN WIPED.) THE SECOND EVENT WAS THIS PAST WED., OCT. 2, THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS BEFORE HAPPENED AGAIN. ONLY ON THIS OCCASION, OUR MECHANIC'S DIAGNOSTIC TESTING DID NOT PROVIDE A CODE AS IT HAD BEFORE, BUT RECOGNIZING THE COMPLAINT, THEY RESET THE SENSOR AGAIN. IN BOTH EVENTS, THE ROADS WERE DRY, CLEAR WEATHER, WE WERE DRIVING ON NEW TIRES AND AT LOW SPEEDS, HAVING JUST MOMENTS BEFORE TURNED ON THE IGNITION AND BEGUN ACCELERATING. WE ARE NOW BEING TOLD THAT OUR VEHICLE HAS TWO BROKEN MOTOR MOUNTS. WE HIGHLY SUSPECT THIS IS DUE TO THE SUDDEN JERKING BACK AND FORWARDS FROM THIS INVOLUNTARY DECELERATION/ACCELERATION ISSUE; IT'S AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR!

I ALSO THINK THAT HONDA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL TO REPLACE THE FAULTY MOTOR MOUNTS AT NO COST TO THE VEHICLE'S OWNERS AND SHOULD REIMBURSE OWNERS (CURRENT AND PRIOR) FOR ANY RELATED REPAIR COSTS.  SINCE A FAULTY MOTOR MOUNT TRIGGERED A REJECTION IN A VIRGINIA STATE SAFETY INSPECTION, THIS HONDA MOTOR MOUNT FAILURE ISSUE IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE.    *TR",

LAST WEEK ON 06/23/2013 WHILE INSPECTING THE PULSATION ISSUES, I FOUND FINE CRACKS ON BOTH ROTORS.

IT SEEMED TO OPEN SLOWER THAN NORMAL.  I WENT TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS  ATTACHED TO THE HATCH THAT WOULD SLOW DOWN ITS OPENING.  IT WAS RAINING, SO I STEPPED UNDER THE HATCH.  WITHOUT WARNING IT CAME DOWN ON ME.  THE INTERIOR OF THE HATCH HIT ME ON THE HEAD, KNOCKED ME FORWARD THEN HIT ME IN THE BACK OF MY LEGS, CAUSING PAIN TO BOTH MY SHINS AND CALVES WHERE I WAS STRUCK BY THE HATCH AND REAR BUMPER. I ALREADY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH A STAINED NECK DUE TO MILITARY RELATED SERVICE.  WHEN THE HATCH HIT ME ON THE HEAD I FELT A SUDDEN JOLT OF PAIN IN MY ARM AND SHOULDER, LIKE A HUGE ELECTRIC SHOCK.  NOW MY NECK IS VERY SORE/STIFF.     I HAVE HAD MANY OTHER CARS WITH REAR HATCHES.  THE HATCH STRUTS WOULD SLOWLY LOSE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, AND WOULD GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF WARNING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE IN NEED OF REPAIR.  THESE HATCHES WOULD BECOME LESS EFFECTIVE IN THE WINTER, DURING COLD WEATHER.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH OUR ODYSSEY.  IT HAPPENED SUDDENLY; ONE DAY IT WAS FINE, THE NEXT DAY IT WAS SMACKING ME IN THE HEAD.     SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE DESIGN OF THESE THINGS.  I'M GOING TO CONTACT HONDA OF AMERICA AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A SERIOUS SAFETY FLAW IN THAT THESE THINGS COULD SUDDENLY FAIL SO RAPIDLY. I'M A STRONG, HEALTHY MAN.  I WORK AS  FIREFIGHTER IN A BIG CITY, SO THIS KIND OF TRAUMA IS NOT A HUGE DEAL TO ME.  I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF A SMALLER PERSON WAS STRUCK BY THIS HATCH.  *TR",

I BELIEVE THAT A RECALL SHOULD BE REQUIRED AND ALL OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE RESERVOIR (OR PUMP) SHOULD BE 100% REIMBURSED. AMERICAN HONDA AUTOMOBILE REFUSED TO REIMBURSE FOR THIS REPLACEMENT STATING THAT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY APPLIES ONLY TO THE PUMP. PLEASE REVIEW HUGE COMPLAINT DATA BASE.  *TR",

I AM ASKING NETS OFFICIALS TO INVESTIGATE HONDA FOR THE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES ON ALL HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVANS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:  THOUSANDS IF NOT, MILLIONS EFFECTED - ACCORDING TO THOUSANDS OF HONDA OWNERS ON THE INTERNET WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE, THE WHEEL BEARINGS BREAK ANYWHERE FROM 1200K (JUST OFF THE LOT) TO 75K.    SAFETY ' WHEN YOU CONTINUE DRIVING A VEHICLE WITH BAD BEARINGS, THE SYMPTOMS WILL WORSEN AND SAFETY RISKS INCREASE. THE STEERING WHEEL WILL BECOME HARDER TO CONTROL. IF THIS HAPPENS, NAVIGATING AND STEERING WILL BE DIFFICULT. A WHEEL WILL BECOME LOOSE AND MOVE AROUND IN THE WHEEL ARCH, CAUSING DAMAGE TO HUB AND BRAKES. IF THE WHEEL REMAINS UNSTABLE, IT WILL EVENTUALLY DETACH FROM THE VEHICLE WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING.  ABS ISSUES - WHEEL BEARINGS CONTAIN SENSORS THAT SEND A SIGNAL TO THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) WHEN THE TIRES SPIN OR SKID. CONTINUING TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH BAD BEARINGS CAN CAUSE ITS ABS SYSTEM TO FAIL. WHEN BEARINGS ARE FAULTY, THE ABS SIGNAL LIGHT USUALLY APPEARS ON THE DASH INDICATING THE DISABLEMENT OF THE ABS SYSTEM. THIS GENERALLY DOES NOT CAUSE ANY INTERRUPTIONS IN REGULAR BRAKING; HOWEVER, IT WILL SUSPEND THE ABS SYSTEM'S AID IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OR WHILE BRAKING ON WET OR SLIPPERY SURFACES.",

THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY MATTER THAT CAN CAUSE A CRASH AND/OR DEATH TO THE DRIVER AND/OR PASSENGERS IF THE WHEEL BEARING OR BEARINGS COME OFF THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS A VERY POPULAR FAMILY VEHICLE IS THE UNITED STATES AND HONDA HAVE SOLD MILLIONS OF HONDA ODYSSEY IN THIS COUNTRY.  THE HONDA DEALER SERVICE ADVISOR COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT THE FRONT WHEEL OF MY HONDA ODYSSEY WAS IN DANGER OF COMING OFF (THIS IS SAFETY MATTER).  I REPAIRED THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER AND IT COST ME OVER $1000.00 TO REPLACE THE LEFT FRONT AND REAR WHEEL BEARINGS OF MY VEHICLE.  FURTHERMORE, THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT NEEDED TO BE DONE BY THE DEALER TECHNICIAN AFTER THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE REPLACED ON MY VEHICLE.  I ASKED HONDA TO COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR AND HONDA HEADQUARTERS CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT DECLINED TO PAY BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS OUT WARRANTY.  ACCORDING TO HONDA THE WHEEL BEARINGS COME WITH 5 YEARS OR 60,000 MILES WARRANTY. MY VEHICLE WAS OVER THAT LIMIT.  I AM ASKING NHTSA OFFICIALS TO INVESTIGATE HONDA FOR THE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES ON ALL HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVANS.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMER FOR YEARS.  I TAKE MY HONDA VEHICLES TO ONLY HONDA DEALERS FOR SERVICES AND FOR HONDA TO DECLINE THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CLEAR SAFETY MATTER IS NOT RIGHT.  I TRULY HOPE HONDA HEADQUARTERS IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA DOES THE RIGHT THING AND MAKES THE RIGHT DECISION IN SUPPORTING ITS LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND CONTINUE STANDING BEHIND ITS VEHICLES AND PRODUCTS BY RECALLING THE HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVANS BEFORE NHTSA STARTS AN INVESTIGATION.  IN CONCLUSION, THIS IS A SAFETY MATTER THAT HONDA MUST ADDRESS BY RECALLING THE WHEEL BEARINGS BEFORE ANY ONE GETS IN AN ACCIDENT OR CRASH. *TR",

I WAS ABOUT 1 MILE BEHIND HER IN MY VEHICLE AND SHE CALLED TO LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  I PULLED OVER AT THE GAS STATION AND HAD MY WIFE AND KIDS SWITCH CARS WITH ME.

        "summary": "2007 HONDA ODYSSEY PULLS HARD RIGHT AFTER RIGHT TURN AND HARD LEFT AFTER LEFT TURN. THIS IS A MAJOR DRIVING HAZARD AS THE VEHICLE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PULL OFF THE ROAD VERY QUICKLY OR INTO OTHER VEHICLES IF THE STEERING IS NOT CONSTANTLY CORRECTED.    I BOUGHT A USED CPO HONDA ODYSSEY IN AUGUST OF 2010, AND WE NOTICED THIS PULLING PROBLEM RIGHT OFF THE LOT. ON A FLAT SURFACE AFTER A RIGHT OR LEFT TURN, THE VEHICLE WILL CHANGE LANES IN 3 SECONDS IF NOT CORRECTED.     WE HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP 2 TIMES, AND THEY TRIED MANY THINGS TO NO AVAIL (TIRE ROTATIONS, ALIGNMENT, TIRE DEFLATIONS, ETC...). I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE SUSPENSION AND STRUTS BECAUSE A PERSON POSTED AN UNOFFICIAL FIX ONLINE THAT DEALS WITH IMPROPERLY ALIGNED STRUTS THAT WORKED. THE SERVICE ADVISOR CLAIMED THAT THEY REMOVED THE STRUTS AND THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM IS NOT FIXED, AND ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM SEEMS WORSE NOW. I AM PRETTY SURE THEY DID NOT REMOVE THE STRUTS AT ALL SINCE I REQUESTED TO SEE THE STRUTS WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED AND THEY DID NOT SHOW THEM TO ME AT ALL. THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND TWO TECHNICIANS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WHEN THEY RODE ALONG ON TEST DRIVES WITH ME, BUT THE ARE CLAIMING THAT THE ISSUE WELL WITHIN THE SPECS DEFINED BY HONDA. THEY CONTINUE TO EXCLAIM THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THEY CAN DO. THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO FIX THIS, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM PROPERLY.    MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD, AND I AM WORRIED THAT MY FAMILY OF FIVE MAY BE INVOLVED IN A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE PULLING PROBLEM IS SO BAD.    PLEASE HELP MY FAMILY AND ALL THE OTHER HONDA ODYSSEY OWNERS WHO ARE HAVING THIS PULLING / ALIGNMENT PROBLEM GET A PROPER FIX BY ISSUING A RECALL THAT REQUIRES HONDA TO CONFESS TO THE ISSUE OFFICIALLY AND FIX THE PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL BEFORE SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS. *TR",

THE RECALL WORK FOR MY SOFT BRAKE PEDAL AND THE VIBRATION OCCURRING AT HIGHWAY SPEED OF 65 MPH AND ABOVE, WAS TO BE DONE.

I WAS TOLD A MECHANIC HAD CALLED IN AND THAT A PROBLEM WITH A NEW CAR REQUIRED SOME PRIORITY WORK SO MY CAR WAS NOT WORKED ON.    HAVING WORKED AROUND AUTOMOBILE SHOPS FROM A TEENAGER ONWARD I AM NOT EXACTLY A NOVICE.  BRAKE WORK IS NOT A JOKE AND THERE ARE SERIOUS STATE LAWS INVOLVED FOR A DRIVER TO KNOWINGLY DRIVE A CAR WITH FAULTY BRAKES.  UNFORTUNATELY MILLER HONDA FAILS TO REALIZE THAT BRAKES ARE A PRIORITY AND NOTHING TO FOOLED AROUND WITH.      MILLER HONDA SPENDS A FORTUNE ON ADVERTISING ATTEMPTING TO ENTICE THE PUBLIC TO COME TO THEIR DEALERSHIP AND PURCHASE CARS FROM THEM.  THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND TREAT PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS AND HONDA OWNERS AS DISPOSABLE ITEMS.  WHAT EXACTLY THE THINKING IS BEHIND THEIR BUSINESS PLAN TOTALLY ESCAPES ME.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT I AM FREE TO HAVE MY HONDA REPAIRED BY ANY HONDA DEALER?  SHOULD THIS INFORMATION BE ACCURATE, I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THERE IS ONE IN THE AREA THAT IS ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND JUST MIGHT HAVE A DESIRE TO SELL ANOTHER HONDA SOMEDAY.

THIS HAS BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN ENTERING THE HIGHWAY OR MAKING MANEUVERS THAT REQUIRES A QUICK INCREASE IN SPEED. THE HESITATION AND JUDDERING CREATES A VERY LARGE VIBRATION THROUGH THE ENTIRE MINIVAN.  OUR ODYSSEY HAS HAD TWO SOFTWARE UPDATES AND IT APPEARS THE TORQUE CONVERTER WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED NEXT. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE IT HAD 5,000 MILES. WE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT THE 10K SERVICE, HOWEVER, THE DEALER SAID THAT THE ISSUE WAS PROBABLY FUEL RELATED.  HOWEVER, ONE SERVICE MANAGER AT A LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TOLD US IT IS MOST LIKELY A TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND THERE WAS NO KNOWN FIX FOR IT AT THE TIME. SINCE THEN HONDA HAS IDENTIFIED TWO SOFTWARE UPDATES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND IF THIS DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THE TORQUE CONVERTER WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED NEXT. WHAT WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD IS THAT IF THE TORQUE CONVERTER HAS BEEN BAD FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT WILL START PUTTING OUT METAL SHAVINGS THAT WILL GET INTO THE GEARS OF THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY DAMAGE THE TRANSMISSION. HOWEVER, HONDA WILL NOT COVER A NEW TRANSMISSION UNLESS IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS DAMAGED, THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO UNLESS THE TRANSMISSION IS TRULY SHOWING SIGNS OF FAILURE OR ENOUGH OIL SHAVINGS CAN BE FOUND IN THE TRANSMISSION OIL. IT SEEMS THAT THE CONSENSUS IS THAT ODYSSEYS WITH THIS PROBLEM WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE A SHORTEN LIFE SPAN OF THEIR TRANSMISSION. WE HAVE LESS THAN 40,000 MILES ON OUR ODYSSEY.   MY OPINION IS HONDA IS TRYING PATCH A PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES MAJOR SURGERY WITH BAND AIDS, HOPING THEY CAN GET BEYOND THEIR REQUIRED RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  I GUESS UNTIL SOMEONE GETS HURT OR KILLED, THIS WILL NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THIS IS A SHAME WE HAVE OWNED A HONDA OR ACURA FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND THEIR REPUTATION HAS BEEN EXCELLENT. *TR",

THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE LIGHTS. THE INTERIOR DASH LIGHTS ARE ON CONTINUOUSLY, BUT THE HEADLIGHTS ONLY GO ON MANUALLY. WHILE THIS IS FINE DURING THE DAY, IT POSES THE POTENTIAL HARM AT NIGHT WHEN THE DASH LIGHTS GO ON AND THEY HEADLIGHTS DO NOT. I LIVE IN A CITY AND A FEW TIMES AT NIGHT WHILE LEAVING A VERY LIT AREA, I HAVE FAILED TO TURN ON MY HEADLIGHTS BECAUSE WITH THE DASHLIGHTS ON I HAVE FORGOTTEN. WHILE THESE OCCURRENCES WERE MY ERROR, I FEEL THAT WITH CAR LIGHTING IT NEEDS TO BE ALL OR NOTHING. WHILE THE MANUFACTURERS MAY SEE THIS FEATURE AS A CONVENIENCE I SEE IT AS A HAZARD. IF THE DASH LIGHTS ARE ON ALL OF THE TIME, THEN THE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE ON. DRIVING WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS ON AT NIGHT IS HAZARDOUS TO ALL AROUND AND AS I SAID, I LIVE IN A CITY WHERE IT IS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MANY TIMES THE STREETS ARE SO BRIGHT MY HEADLIGHTS DO NOT MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE FOR MY LIGHTING BUT RATHER JUST MAKE ME NOTICEABLE TO OTHERS. I FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND RECTIFIED. I KNOW THAT OTHER CARS HAVE AN AUTO FUNCTION, WHERE THE HEADLIGHTS CAN BE LEFT ON ALL OF THE TIME TO GO ON WHEN IT GETS DARK AND THIS WOULD BE A SAFER FEATURE THAN HAVING THEM MANUALLY OPERATED WHEN THE DASH LIGHTS ARE ON ALL OF THE TIME. OR THEY CAN MAKE IT SO THAT THE DASH LIGHTS GO ON WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TURNED ON. LIKE I SAID, WITH LIGHTS IS NEEDS TO BE ALL OR NOTHING (ALL MANUAL OR ALL AUTOMATIC, NOT HALF AND HALF). IT IS JUST TOO CONFUSING AND IN MY CASE, LIKELY TO BE FORGOTTEN. WHILE THIS ISSUE MAY NOT HAVE CAUSED HARM YET, I DO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT POTENTIAL TO CAUSE HARM AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THIS IS A FAILURE ON THE MANUFACTURERS PART TO SAVE MONEY, BUT IT HAS MADE A MINI VAN (WHICH IS KNOWN FOR SAFETY) TO FEEL UNSAFE. ESTIMATED DATE. *TR",

I KNOW THIS CAN BE OFF BY A FEW MILES AND HENCE THE TINY PRINT THAT SAYS IT CAN BE A LOW OF 16/22. AND BOY WOULD I BE GLAD IF I WAS GETTING 16!    I DO ALMOST ALL OF MY DRIVING IN TOWN AND WAS REALLY SURPRISED THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO ALREADY FILL IT UP WITH JUST OVER 200 MILES ON IT!  I THOUGHT IT WAS BAD GAS SO TRIED IT A COUPLE MORE TIMES WITH HIGH OCTANE GAS AND STILL THE SAME.  THE VAN WAS AT BEST GETTING 9MPG IN TOWN!  ( WHEN WE ARE ON THE HIGHWAY IT GETS WHAT THE STICKER SAYS.)  I EVEN STARTED TO DRIVE AS CAREFULLY/SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE TO SEE IF ANY CHANGES AND HAD NONE.    WE DECIDED TO DRIVE 2 HOURS BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM CHECK IT OUT B/C SOMETHING HAD TO BE WRONG.  SINCE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WARNING LIGHTS THERE WAS NOT A LOT THE MECHANICS SAID THEY COULD TROUBLESHOOT.  THEY PRETTY MUCH HOOKED UP A MACHINE AND DROVE IT AROUND TOWN.  THEIR MACHINE SAID WE GOT 12 TO 13 MPG, STILL NOT WHAT THEY CLAIM IT SHOULD BE GETTING BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT!   THEY SAID THEY CHECKED THE OIL, FUEL INJECTORS , MADE SURE WE WERE PUTTING THE RIGHT KIND OF GAS IN.  THEY PRINTED OFF HOW TO CALCULATE MPG, WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW AND SENT US ON OUR MERRY LITTLE WAY TO THE GAS PUMPS!    THESE CAR COMPANIES NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ESTIMATED MPG AND IF A VEHICLE DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THOSE ESTIMATIONS THE CUSTOMER SHOULD AT LEAST BE REFUNDED THE EXTRA AMOUNT THEY ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR GAS.  WITH GAS PRICES GOING UP THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY B/C THIS IS THE MAJOR REASON PEOPLE ARE BUYING DIFFERENT VEHICLES RIGHT NOW.  WHO AND WHAT IS MAKING SURE THESE MPG ARE NOT BOGUS SO CUSTOMERS AREN'T GETTING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.  THERE NEEDS TO BE CUSTOMER PROTECTION ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. *TR",

IN THIS CASE THE DOOR DID NOT BOUNCE BACK OPEN AS IT SHOULD HAVE AND CLOSED ON MY KIDS HAND.  B) ONCE THE DOOR HAD ALREADY CLOSED ON HIS HAND WE COULD NOT GET IT TO OPEN BACK UP AND MY KIDS HAND WAS STILL STUCK IN THE DOOR.

WE TOOK MY SON TO THE HOSPITAL FOR XRAYS AND THEY SAID THAT DUE TO HIS AGE IT IS THE ONLY REASON HE HAS NO BROKEN BONES (AT AGE 2 THE BONES ARE STILL SOFT AND ABLE TO FLEX) THEY DO SUSPECT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME FRACTURES SO THEY PUT HIM IN A SOFT CAST AND TOLD US TO SCHEDULE A VISIT WITH A HAND SURGEON TO INSPECT THE HAND TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO FRACTURES AND TO CHECK HIS GROWTH PALATES.

I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS WAS DEEMED A ?FREAK ACCIDENT? AND AN ?ACT OF NATURE? AND THEREFORE WAS NOT A WARRANTY.  THE TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIR, INCLUDING LABOR, WAS $780.00. I WAS INFORMED BY AMERICAN HONDA THAT THE ONLY WARRANTABLE REPAIRS ARE ?FACTORY DEFECTS?.

I INVESTIGATED THE MATTER FURTHER AND DISCOVERED THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR'S MODEL, THE 2008 ODYSSEY, HONDA HAS GONE IN AND ADDED A GRILL OVER THE CONDENSER TO PROTECT IT.
