WHEN I REMOVED THE FILL HOSE, THE ALUMINUM (CAST I THINK) VALVE STEM END BROKE OFF WITH THE VALVE MECHANISM ITSELF AND THE TIRE RAPIDLY DEFLATED.  NO UNUSUAL FORCE WAS APPLIED TO THE VALVE WITH THE PORTABLE AIR PUMP I HAVE USED NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS AND OTHER CAR TIRES.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE VALVE  FAILED WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY (SOMETHING ELSE TO BE THANKFUL FOR THAT DAY!).  I JUST READ WHERE  A SIMILAR VEHICLE (FORD ESCAPE I BELIEVE) EXPERIENCED A VALVE STEM FAILURE THAT APPARENTLY CONTRIBUTED TO A ROLL OVER AND FATALITY.  ALTHOUGH A RUBBER VALVE STEM CRACKED IN THE FORD  CASE, THE RAPID DEFLATION WOULD BE THE SAME IN MY CASE HAD I BEEN DRIVING - AND THE POTENTIAL DRASTIC RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME.    I HAD THE VALVE REPLACED FOR $156.00.  ALTHOUGH I PREFERRED TO REPLACE IT WITH A RUBBER ONE, I WAS TOLD THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND INSPECTION WOULD FAIL SINCE THE ABSENCE OF THE REMOTE SENSOR WOULD CAUSE A DASH-BOARD WARNING LIGHT.  THE TECHNICIAN SAID THE VALVE CRACKED DUE TO CORROSION - IN A FOUR YEAR OLD CAR!  *TR",
