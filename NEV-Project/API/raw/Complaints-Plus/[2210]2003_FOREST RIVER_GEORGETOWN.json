BOTH TIMES, THIS ISSUE HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE DRIVING ON BUSY HIGHWAYS.  WE HAVE HAD TO BE TOWED, HAD 2 VACATIONS RUINED, HAD TO STAY IN A HOTEL AND PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR REPAIRS AND DIAGNOSTICS.  BOTH TIMES, IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM THE RGS PRESSURE SWITCH AND THE RELAY SWITCH.  WE WERE TOLD BY SEVERAL MECHANICS, THAT THIS IS A PART THAT FAILS REGULARLY AND WERE TOLD TO KEEP ONE ON HAND AND SHOWN HOW TO REPLACE IT.  WE FEEL THAT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
