THE ABS WORKS WELL UNDER OTHER LOW FRICTION CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS RAIN, SNOW, AND ICE. THE ABS AND BRAKING SYSTEM HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE WORKING PROPERLY. PANIC BRAKING DISTANCES ARE LONG WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL PUSHED TO THE FLOOR, THE CAR FEELS AS IF IT IS NOT STOPPING FAST ENOUGH ON DRY PAVEMENT. NORMAL, NON PANIC BRAKING SEEMS TO BE NORMAL. I HAVE HAD NEW BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS INSTALLED. BRAKE FLUID HAS BEEN FLUSHED TWICE AND I INSTALLED STAINLESS STEEL FLEXIBLE BRAKE LINES ALL OF WHICH MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN FULL PANIC BRAKING. OVER A FEW YEARS I HAVE HAD 3 INDEPENDENT SHOPS CHECK THE BRAKES AND ALL SAID THAT THE BRAKES WERE NORMAL. IN APRIL 2013, I HAD THE ACURA DEALER EVALUATE THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND WAS TOLD \"NORMAL, THIS IS JUST HOW THEY BRAKE\". TO DO A COMPARISON, I TEST DROVE A USED 05 MDX AT THE HONDA DEALER AND IT BRAKED EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY 04: NO ABILITY TO ACTIVATE THE ABS IN A FULL PANIC STOP FROM ANY SPEED ON DRY PAVEMENT. RECENTLY, HONDA RECALLED 250,000 VEHICLES FOR A DEFECTIVE BRAKE BOOSTER AND THE 01-06 MDX IS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT RECALL. THIS RECALL WAS BASED ON HONDA'S AUDIT OF WARRANTY CLAIMS. CARS LIKE MY MDX ARE WELL BEYOND THE WARRANTY PERIOD AND WOULD NEVER BE FOUND BASED ON ANY WARRANTY CLAIM HISTORY. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT MY 04 MDX (AND LIKELY OTHER MDX VEHICLES) HAS A DEFECTIVE BRAKE BOOSTER RESULTING IN POOR BRAKING PERFORMANCE AND CREATES A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD. IN MAY 2013, I SOLD MY 04 MDX TO THE SAME ACURA DEALER WHO DID THE EVALUATION OF THE BRAKES. IN JUNE 2013, I CONTACTED ACURA HQ AND ADVISED THEM OF THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO MONITOR FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.   *TR",

I WAS SPLASHED WITH GASOLINE.  THINKING THAT I HAD PLACED THE NOZZLE INCORRECTLY, I TRIED IT AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT.  I WAS AGAIN SPLASHED WITH GASOLINE.  I THEN WONDERED IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE GAS PUMP AND I MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PUMP AT THE SAME STATION.  AGAIN, I HAD THE SAME RESULT, BUT I WAS SPLASHED LESS AS I HAD ANTICIPATED WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENED.  I TOLD MY HUSBAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND THE NEXT DAY, HE WENT TO THE STATION WITH ME.  HE WAS ABLE TO DRIBBLE SOME GASOLINE INTO THE TANK WITH THE NOZZLE ON MANUAL.  I LOOKED UP THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED THE SAME ISSUE WITH SEVERAL VEHICLES OF THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL.  ON 12/21/13, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND INFORMED THEM OF THE ISSUE, AND I CALLED ACURA CUSTOMER CARE TO REPORT IT.  IT WAS SEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 12/22/13.  TWO PARTS WERE REPLACED -- \"CANISTER ASSY\" AND \"MOD. CANISTER D\" (NOT THE GAS TANK) ON 12/23/13, AS THE PARTS HAD FAILED FUNCTIONAL TESTING.  I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AT APPROXIMATELY 2:45 PM ON 12/23/13, DROVE TO A GAS STATION, PUT THE NOZZLE IN THE INTAKE LOCATION AND HAD THE EXACT SAME RESULT AS BEFORE.  GASOLINE SPEWED OUT AND SPRAYED ME AGAIN.  I HAVE SAFETY CONCERNS ON A COUPLE OF LEVELS:  THE SPILLED/SPEWED GASOLINE POSES A FIRE HAZARD FOR ME, THE VEHICLE, THE GAS STATION, AND THOSE PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO ARE ALSO FILLING UP, AND HAVING GASOLINE SPILLED ON ME IS AN OBVIOUS HEALTH HAZARD.  *TR",

I WENT TO THE DEALER, WHO SAID THAT I NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO FIX THE PROBLEM, EVENTHOUGH AS A NEW CUSTOMER I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE CAR, INDICATING A PROBLEM WITHIN TWO DAYS OF DRIVING LESS THAN 100 MILES.    I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THE ISSUE I AM FACING IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITHIN THE RANGE OF MY VIN NUMBER. BUT ACURA DEALER AND THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP OFFICE IN LA DENIED THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I ALSO FOUND A SIMILAR THE ISSUE DOCUMENTED ON YOUR WEBSITE.     AS A CONSUMER WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS HERE ?    A) CAN I GET ACURA TO PROVIDE ME THE LEVEL OF QUALITY AND SERVICE I AM EXPECTING   B) REJECT THE PRODUCT IF THEY FAILED TO NOTIFY ME ABOUT THE PROBLEM BEFORE I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT(FAIR DISCLOSURE) ABOUT THE RECALL   C) THEY DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.    I KNOW SOMEONE WHO BOUGHT THE *SAME* MODEL CAR FROM THE *SAME* DEALERSHIP AND THEIR CAR ALSO FALLS IN THE *SAME* VIN RANGE WHICH IS DOCUMENTED TO HAVE THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD THEM THAT ITS A KNOWN ISSUE WHEN THEY CALLED THE ACURA DEALER SERVICE, AND ASK THEM TO COME DOWN FOR SERVICE. BUT WHEN I ASK THE SAME QUESTION THEY DENY KNOWING ANY ISSUE WITH THE CAR, THEY EVEN SHOWED ME A PRINT OUT WHICH SAYS NOTHING IS FLAGGED AGAINST MY VIN NUMBER.    I HAVE CURRENTLY GIVEN MY CAR FOR SERVICE, AND I AM ON A LOANER CAR FROM THE DEALER. STILL WAITING FOR THE CAR TO BE SERVICED. ALSO I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THE PROBLEM REAPPEARS, IT WILL FURTHER ERODE MY CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR AND THE DEALIERSHIP.     I AM ALSO EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED AS A CONSUMER AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT SHOULD I DO SO THAT OTHER ACURA CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PAIN LIKE I AM GOING THROGUH AND ALSO GET COMPENSATED FOR THE DAMAGES AND INCONVINIENCE CAUSED BY THIS INCIDENT.*AK",
