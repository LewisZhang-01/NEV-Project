They mentioned that we need to drive car often and not leave it sit or this will happen.  Luckily, there was no \"trouble\" only a drained battery, but it was an inconvenience.  We bought the car based on Subaru's reputation for durability.  We are 78 & 83 years of age respectively and my husband and I have medical issues.  We need a car we can rely on at all times in case of an emergency.  If this is a known problem, why was I not informed of this upon purchase?  Why was there no mention in the owner's manual or new owners handout.  Since the incident, I see many complaints on Web.",

This also caused the EyeSight safety system, adaptive cruise control (with lane keep assist), and reverse auto braking to all shut down (my dashboard lit up with warning lights and errors).  2. Not only is this an annoyance, but having all of the safety systems in my car unexpectedly shut down is extremely unsafe, especially adaptive cruise control. Other functions of my car, such as the radio and climate controls are also inaccessible when this happens.  3. A Subaru dealer has replaced the touchscreen in my vehicle to try and remedy the slowness and crashing, but it did not seem to fix anything. My car safety systems have not shut down prior to this incident, but on this day (June 6th), they did when the system crashed, which was after the replacement. After waiting weeks to get a replacement which didn't fix anything, I felt as if I needed to go elsewhere for help with this issue.  4. Only the manufacturer has inspected this issue, and I've also emailed Subaru directly after this incident, as to which I have not gotten a response yet (emailed on Monday, June 7th).  5. The warning lamps (for EyeSight, reverse auto breaking, and adaptive cruise control) all appeared on my dashboard as soon as the infotainment system crashed on June 6th. Prior to this, my vehicle had no warning lamps. They went away a few minutes after the system rebooted (all while I was driving on the highway), and system functionality returned to normal.  Other Notes: This vehicle only has about 15k miles on it, and is only 1 year and 3 months old. Issues like this should not be happening. Before the replacement of the touchscreen, I had issues with it being extremely laggy and crashing, but my car's safety systems never shut down before.
