THIS WORK WAS DONE IN APRIL 2017: DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE ENGINES FRONT VALVE COVER AND FRONT-VALVE-COVER GASKET WITH NEW PARTS OF AN IMPROVED DESIGN AND REMOVE THE ENGINES PLASTIC COVER AND PLASTIC OIL-FILL-TUBE EXTENSION. SUMMER OF 2017 WE HAD THE OIL AND FILTER REPLACED, AND AFTERWARDS LOTS OF SMOKE CAME FROM ENGINE. WE THOUGHT THE MECHANIC HAD SIMPLY SPILLED SOME OIL ON THE ENGINE. SUMMER OF 2018 OIL AND FILTER WAS CHANGED AND SMOKE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, WE AGAIN THOUGHT THE MECHANIC HAD SPILLED SOME OIL ON THE ENGINE. IN MARCH OF 2019 THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, FACING DOWNHILL AT AN ABOVE AVERAGE ANGLE, AND OIL BEGAN TO SEEP OUT OF THE ENGINE AND BURN OF ON THE HOT EXHAUST MANIFOLD LOTS OF SMOKE AND POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD. THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO BOB MCCOSH, WHO HAD PERFORMED THE ORIGINAL GASKET REPLACEMENT IN 2017, TO HAVE THE ORIGINAL RECALL WORK INSPECTED. UPON INSPECTION A PIECE OF GASKET, ABOUT 2 TO 3 INCHES LONG, WAS FOUND TO BE PROTRUDING FROM BETWEEN THE VALVE COVER AND THE ENGINE. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION OF THIS GASKET, THE EDGE OF THE GASKET VISUALLY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE BOLT AS IT WAS TIGHTENED AND THIS EITHER TORE THE GASKET OR WEAKENED IT SUFFICIENTLY SO THAT THE GASKET FAILED. SAID GASKET IS CURRENTLY IN MY POSSESSION. WE KNOW IT FAILED BEFORE THE OIL/FILTER CHANGE IN THE SUMMER OF 2017, BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE THAT ISSUED FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AFTERWARDS.

SAT FOR AWHILE FOUND SECOND SET OF KEYS PUT IT IN AND IT STARTED. APPARENTLY THE SECURITY SYSTEM WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE KEY WHEN IT WAS INSERTED INTO THE IGNITION. THIS LOCKED THE CONTACT IN THE VEHICLE AND PREVENTED IT FROM STARTING. THE VEHICLE IS NOW IN THE SHOP.  I HAVE FOUND OVER 1,000 COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME NATURE WITH THIS CAR. IN 2004 I HAD NEW HEAD GASKETS PUT ON DUE TO THE COOLANT AND WAS SUPPOSE TO RECOUP SOME MONEY.  I PUT IN CLAIM AND NEVER HEARD ANYTHING.  NOW TURN SIGNALS WORK INTERMEDIATELY. THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH IMPALAS. VERY DANGEROUS WHEN I SIGNAL I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS GOING TO WORK. I HAVE ALMOST CAUSED MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. I COMPLAINED MULTIPLE TIMES TO THE DEALER BUT THEY CLAIMED NOTHING WAS WRONG. AS SOON AS I HIT THE 100,000 MILE.   *TR",

IT WAS HORRIFYING - THE BRAKE PEDAL & STEERING WHEEL LOCKED, SO I FORCIBLY TURNED THE WHEEL WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, COASTED TO THE SHOULDER, WITH TWO NEAR-COLLISIONS, PRESSED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, THEN SHIFTED TO PARK. THE RED BATTERY SYMBOL WAS ILLUMINATED ON THE DASHBOARD AS IF THE KEY WAS SET TO \"ON\", BUT NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  I NOTICED THE HEADLIGHTS AND THE DASH LIGHTS WERE OFF, BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE THE CAR SHUT OFF (WHICH IS WHAT WOULD NORMALLY HAPPEN AFTER SHUTTING OFF A CAR WITH AUTO-OFF LIGHTS).     SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO START ONLY RESULTED IN SOUNDS OF A CAR STRUGGLING TO TURN OVER, BUT NEVER ACTUALLY TURNING. EVENTUALLY THE CAR STUTTERED, BUT STARTED. I WAS BACK IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC, AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF DRIVING, IT SHUT OFF AGAIN. SAME DRILL - COASTED OFF THE ROAD, AND SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS TO START BEFORE FINALLY STARTING. BACK ON THE ROAD, A FEW MINUTES LATER, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. AFTER 2 MORE EPISODES OF THIS, INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING TO START, THE WASN'T EVEN COMING CLOSE. THE CAR RADIO AND HAZARD LIGHTS WERE STILL WORKING. WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT CONSTANT STARTING ATTEMPTS MAY HAVE EXHAUSTED THE BATTERY.     AFTER A SUCCESSFUL START, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME, USING LOCAL ROADS FOR FEAR OF A HIGHWAY CRASH. 25 MINUTES LATER, THE CAR WAS STILL RUNNING JUST FINE. IT DIDN'T SHUT OFF AGAIN UNTIL I WAS PARKED AT HOME AND IDLING FOR A FEW MINUTES. EVERYTIME IT SHUT OFF, I'D SEE *NO* CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, *NO* WARNINGS FROM THE MIL, THOUGH IT'S FULLY FUNCTIONAL.     THE NEXT DAY I MOVED THE CAR FOR ALTERNATE SIDE PARKING AND IT STARTED UP JUST FINE, NO HESITATION. SEVERAL MORE STARTS SINCE MONDAY - NO HESITATION OR PROBLEM.

THE PASSLOCK FAILURE HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY AND IS DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AND FIX/RESOLVE BUT IS REPORTED ON THE INTERNET. THE PASSLOCK FAILURE SEEMS TO BE TIED TO THE 'SECURITY' LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SEEN THAT THE 'SECURITY' LIGHT CAN COME ON FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE DRIVING WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT NOT ALWAYS. THE PASSLOCK FAILURE IS OBSERVED IN 2 SCENARIOS:  1) WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC THE VEHICLE MAY STALL, LEAVING THE DRIVER WITHOUT POWER STEERING OR POWER BRAKES, ALSO THE 'SECURITY' LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD WILL BE LIT.  2) AFTER GETTING INTO THE CAR IT FAILS TO START, THE ENGINE WILL NOT TURN OVER BUT ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS ALL APPEAR TO WORK OKAY, THE 'SECURITY' LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD WILL BE LIT.    FREQUENCY OF FAILURE - THE FREQUENCY OF THESE TWO FAILURES IS UNABLE TO BE PREDICTED, IT HAS OCCURRED MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE DAY, MULTIPLE TIME TIMES ACROSS 2 DAYS AND THEN MAY NOT OCCUR FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS.

THIS IS WHY I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AMERICAN CAR BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE CHEAP AND GM COULD CARE LESS.  THE TIME TO ACT IS BEFORE MAJOR INCIDENTS HAPPEN, BEFORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR LIVES, BEFORE 5 CAR PILE UPS ON THE HIGHWAY, BEFORE AN EMERGENCY THAT GM DRIVERS CANNOT GET TO BECAUSE THERE CAR WILL NOT START.  NOT AFTER!!!  THAT'S TOYOTA'S PROBLEM NOW.  ADVICE FOR GM AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT - GET IT TOGETHER!!! *TR",

I HAD THEM REPLACE NOT KNOWING THAT THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY FOR EMISSIONS AND THEY DIDN'T USE A GM PART.  A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DID COME ON.  AGAIN IT SHOWED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AS THE PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID HE HAD NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH PUTTING A NON-DEALER PART ON A CAR BEFORE BUT DID REPLACE THE CONVERTER ONCE AGAIN WITH A NON-GM PART IN CASE THE FIRST ONE HAPPENED TO BE A BAD PART.  A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS BACK ON.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER SHOWS AS WELL AS THE TRANSMISSION.  OF COURSE, THEY WOULDN'T MAKE GOOD ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BY THIS TIME BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WASN'T THE ORIGINAL GM PART.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST $775 JUST FOR THEM TO LOOK AT THE TRANSMISSION.  I CANNOT AFFORD THIS AND JUST BROUGHT THE CAR HOME.  I'M STILL DRIVING IT BUT IT'S WORSE AND WORSE EVERY DAY.  I WOULDN'T TRUST DRIVING THIS CAR VERY FAR.  I'VE READ MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER & THE TRANSMISSION THAT YOU WOULD THINK GM WOULD HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO SOMETHING.  AT THIS POINT I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GM VEHICLE AND MY HUSBAND IS DIEHARD GM.  I'VE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF THIS CAR HOPING THAT IT WOULD LAST UNTIL MY DAUGHTER STARTS DRIVING AND I COULD HAND IT TRUSTINGLY DOWN TO HER BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE.

IN THE BEGINNING OF APRIL I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PULL OUT INTO A BUSY FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY AS I HIT THE GAS PEDAL TO ACCELERATE THE CAR FELT SLUGGISH AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT GETTING ENOUGH GAS OR NOT SHIFTING INTO GEAR.  THAT EVENING I STOOPED TO FILL UP THE GAS TANK AND UPON LEAVING I WAS CLIMBING A HILL AND THE CAR ACTED UP AGAIN AND MADE A DIFFERENT SOUND AND AGAIN ACTED AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT SHIFTING INTO GEAR OR NOT GETTING ENOUGH FUEL AND THE SECURITY LIGHT (NOT SERVICE ENGINE) CAME ON AND STAYED ON.  I IMMEDIATELY PHONED MY HUSBAND AND HE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP (JOHN SERRETTI).  WE HAVE MAINTAINED THIS VEHICLE FAITHFULLY SINCE WE PURCHASED IT OIL CHANGES, TIRES ROTATED ETC. ALL PERFORMED AT JOHN SERETTI'S EVERY 3/4 MONTHS.  AFTER REVIEWING ALL PAPERWORK RECEIVED AT HOME FOR THE IMPALA MY HUSBAND CAME ACROSS A LETTER FROM GENERAL MOTORS MAILED IN OCTOBER 2005 STATING THAT SOME VEHICLES WERE EXPERIENCING LOSS OF POWER DUE TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND IF WE DID INDEED HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS TO TAKE TO THE DEALER AND THEY WOULD REPLACE IT, BUT IF NOT, NOTHING NEEDED TO BE DONE AND THIS LETTER WAS NOT A RECALL.  THE DEALER PERFORMED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST ($90) AND FOUND THAT INDEED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTED WAS CLOGGED AND SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED THE SPARK PLUGS WIRE TO ARC AND MELT WHICH ALL HAD TO BE REPLACED AT OUR EXPENSE (ALMOST $600).  MY HUSBAND HAS TALKED TO SEVERAL MECHANICS IN REFERENCE TO THIS AND THEY ALL AGREE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION POSSIBLY CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO CATCH ON FIRE.  GM DID COVER PART OF THE REPAIRS BUT IN MY OPINION THEY SHOULD HAVE COVERED THEM ALL BECAUSE THE CONVERTER WAS DEFECTIVE AND IF CARBON HAD BUILT UP TO THAT EXTENT TO CAUSE ALL OF THIS DAMAGE AND LEADING ME AND OTHER MECHANICS TO BELIEVE IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE STARTED A FIRE, WHY WASN'T IT DISCOVERED AT THE PREVIOUS INSPECTION-OIL CHANGE?   *JB",

WHEN I GOT THE CAR IN JUNE OF '05, IT WAS AT 121,000 MILES, I DROVE THE CAR AROUND ALL DAY, PARKED THE CAR FOR 5 MINUTES, AND WHEN I WENT TO START IT, NOTHING HAPPENED. THE DASH LIT UP, THE RADIO CAME ON, BUT THE CAR DIDN'T TURN OVER, NOT EVEN A CLICKING SOUND, INDICATIVE OF A DEAD BATTERY. I WAITED 10 MINUTES, TRIED AGAIN AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. I WENT FOR ANOTHER MONTH WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS, HOWEVER IN LATE JULY, THE CAR FAILED TO START. AGAIN I WAITED 10-15 MINUTES, AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. THIS CONTINUED SPORADICALLY UNTIL OCTOBER 20, WHEN IT TOOK 30 MINUTES OF WAITING TO GET IT TO CRANK. I TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL GM DEALER, WHO PUT IT ON THE MACHINE AND ADVISED ME THAT THE BCM (BODY CONTROL MODULE) HAD FAILED AND WAS SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM TELLING IT THAT MY KEYS WERE INCORRECT. THE SERVICE WRITER INFORMED ME THAT A NEW BCM INSTALLED WOULD RUN ABOUT $500.00, AND  THE SERVICE TECH ADVISED THAT THIS HAS BECOME A COMMON FAILURE IN BOTH THE IMPALA AND THE MALIBU, WHICH GM HAS YET TO RECALL. THE TECHNICIAN DID SUGGEST THAT A MORE COST EFFECTIVE OPTION EXISTED WITH SEVERAL OF THE AFTER-MARKET SHOPS, IN WHICH A BYPASS-RELAY WAS INSTALLED UNDER THE DASH, TO BLOCK THE ERRONEOUS SIGNALS FROM THE BCM, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE  VEHICLE TO OPERATE NORMALLY. THE COST FOR THIS BYPASS IS ABOUT $55.00 AND TAKES APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR TO INSTALL. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS SOLUTION, IS IT BLOCKS THE KEY RECOGNITION FEATURE OF THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM, WHICH WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO STEAL, IF SOMEONE CAN START IT WITHOUT DAMAGING THE KEY IGNITION. I THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR GM TO UNDERSTAND THAT A VEHICLE'S FAILURE TO START DUE TO FAULTY COMPONENT IN THE ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN WHICH NEEDS TO ADDRESSED.  *NM",

HOWEVER, AT 34,000 MILES (NOVEMBER OF 2004) THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY. THANKFULLY SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD THE TAHOE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED AND WOULD BE REPLACED. OUR DEALER ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.   OUR TAHOE WENT OFF OF IT'S NEW CAR WARRANTY ON MILEAGE NOT NUMBER OF MONTHS SOMETIME IN APRIL OF 2005 (36 MONTHS WOULD HAVE ENDED THIS AUGUST). JUST THIS PAST MONDAY (SEPTEMBER 19, 2005) MY WIFE WAS AGAIN ON HER WAY TO WORK WHEN AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED IN OUR 2002 TAHOE. THE MILEAGE WAS APPROX: 41,000 ( TOTAL PERIOD OF MILES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILURE WAS APPROX: 7 MONTHS). THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE SAME, SHE WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND SLIP. THIS TIME SHE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DRIVING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RELATIVE SAFETY. WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND AGAIN THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED. I WENT TO PICK UP THE CAR ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 2005 AND WHILE I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THE DAMAGED PART AND A BENCH THAT CONTAINED SEVERAL DAMAGED \"SUN SHELL\". IT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT TAKE MUCH EFFORT TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRANSMISSION AND SPECIFICALLY THIS PART. *JB",

I TOOK IT TO A DEALER UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY SAID IT HAD WARPED ROTORS AND THEN TURNED ALL 4 ROTORS DOWN AT 19755 MILES.   THEN IN JUNE OF 2005 I TOOK IT BACK IN BECAUSE OF A CONSTANT GRINDING SOUND WHEN BACKING UP AND THE SHIMMY WHEN BRAKING WAS RETURNING MORE EVERYDAY.  THE DEALER THEN TELLS ME THAT IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT IT NEEDS 4 NEW ROTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE WARPED AND PITTED.  THIS IS A PEP CAR FROM THE COMPANY AND I MISTAKENLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY TILL END OF JULY.  I WAS INFORMED THIS IS NOT TRUE AND THAT THE REPAIR WILL BE $732.

SOON AFTER THAT I NOTICED THAT MY CAR FELT LIKE IT MOVED BACK AND FORTH WHEN I DROVE IT, AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VERY LOOSE WHEN I TURNED.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A VERY BIG DEAL BUT TOOK IT INTO THE SHOP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  I TOOK IT IN AND FOUND OUT THAT I WAS MISSING 2 BEARINGS ON MY SUSPENSION WHICH PUT PRESSURE ON MY DRIVE SHAFT(NOT SURE ABOUT ACTUAL TERMINOLOGY HERE NOT SURE IF IT WAS DRIVE SHAFT OR STEERING COLUMN) CAUSING MY RACK AND PINION TO GO BAD.  THAT COST $1100 TO FIX.  SO NOW I AM $1453 INTO HAVING MY CAR REPAIRED FOR THINGS THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE BAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.  TODAY (MAY 9TH 2005) I FOUND OUT THAT MY INTAKE MANIFOLD HAS GONE BAD AND I CAN SMELL BURNING ANTIFREEZE WHEN I DRIVE, AND MY COOLANT SENSOR IS BAD.  TO FIX THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TO COST ME $840.  I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT I HAVE CHECKED THIS CAR OUT ON CARFAX.COM THERE WAS ONLY ONE PREVIOUS OWNER AND NOTHING SIGNIFIGANT AS HOW IT WAS TREATED.  I PURCHASED THIS CAR AT 34,000 MILES AND IT NOW HAS 53,000 MILES.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS SINCE I BOUGHT ALMOST 2YRS AGO.

THEY CHECKED A FEW THINGS INCLUDING THE AIR PUMP.  THEN - BY USING THE TECH II TOOL, THEY WERE ABLE TO RECREATE THE FLCIKERING BY SWITCHING THE AIR PUMP ON.
