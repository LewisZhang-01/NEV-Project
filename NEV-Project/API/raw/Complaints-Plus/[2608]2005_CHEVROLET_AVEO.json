I BORROWED A VEHICLE UNTIL I HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO A MECHANIC FOR REPAIRS.  A MECHANIC LOOKED AT MY VEHICLE AND TOLD ME ON MAY 11, 2015 THAT THE CAR NEEDS A NEW ENGINE, THE PRICE OF WHICH IS $4,823.00.  THE MECHANIC FURTHER TOLD ME THAT THE AFTERMARKET/REMANUFACTURED ENGINES COMPANY THEY DEAL WITH DOES NOT HAVE AN ENGINE FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL CAR BECAUSE THIS ENGINE HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT TOUCH IT.

THAT IS NOT WORKING. I AM DOWN TO ONE HEADLIGHT (DRIVER SIDE) WORKING ' AS FAR AS RUNNING LIGHTS GO. I HAVE NO TAILLIGHTS (BRAKELIGHTS WORK). I COMMUTE APPROX. 40MILES EACH DIRECTION FOR WORK-ALL FREEWAY. I MADE AN APPT W/CHEVY,TOOK THE DAY OFF WORK SO THE CAR COULD BE THERE ALL DAY.AS I ARRIVED TO MY APPT THE SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THERE IS NOT A REMEDY FROM GM YET SO I WILL NEED TO COVER THE COST. EVENTUALLY WE WENT INTO THE BUILDING TO COMPLETE MY WRITE UP, AT THAT POINT I WAS TOLD THEY WERE BACKED UP ON RECALLS SO THEY MAY NOT GET TO MY VEHICLE DESPITE THE APPT. I REITERATED THE ISSUE,HE SAID OKAY,TOLD ME HE WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH ME. AT 3:30 HE CALLED,TOLD ME THEY HADN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE BUT WOULD GET TO IT TOMORROW. I TOOK ANOTHER DAY OFF WORK & LEFT THE CAR WITH THEM.NEXT DAY,I CALLED AT 11AM & I'M TOLD THEY HAVE YET TO TOUCH MY VEHICLE & THERE ARE ABOUT 20 CARS IN FRONT OF ME SO THEY WON'T GET TO IT TODAY EITHER.I COULD NOT LEAVE THE CAR ANOTHER DAY, I TOLD HIM I WOULD PICK IT UP. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED GM EXPLAINED THE SITUATION, THEIR RESPONSE WAS 'WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO ABOUT IT'. I TOLD THEM THE CAR WAS UNSAFE AND ILLEGAL TO DRIVE IN THIS CONDITION I NEEDED IT FIXED. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD CONTACT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEM CONTACT ME. ABOUT 20MINS LATER THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED ME, GAVE ME THE SAME RUN AROUND AS THE FIRST DEALERSHIP.THIS RECALL IS 7MONTHS OLD, IT TOOK GM 10YRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.

I BOUGHT A BOX OF  FUSES BUT THIS ONLY FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR LESS THAN A WEEK.  EVERY TIME I PUT A NEW FUSE IN THE BRAKE LIGHTS WENT BACK OUT IN A DAY OR TWO.  ONE DAY WHILE I WAS ON THE FREEWAY MY CAR JUST SUDDENLY STOPPED WITHOUT ANY WARNING. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER IT WAS STILL UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY.  IT WAS A ELECTRICAL PROBLEM CAUSING ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AND COST OVER $2,000 TO FIX.  A YEAR LATER THE PROBLEMS STARTED AGAIN I CAN'T MOVE MY GEAR WITHOUT USING A SCREW DRIVER, MY BRAKE LIGHTS AND HEADLIGHTS ARE OUT.  IF I SLAM THE HOOD OF MY CAR ONE HEADLIGHT WILL COME ON WHICH SHOWS THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WIRING.  THE ENGINE LIGHT AND HOLD MODE LIGHT FLASHES CONSTANTLY.  I FEEL THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BRAKE LIGHTS WHICH CAN EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  I WAS PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE BECAUSE OF NO BRAKE LIGHTS A $125 TICKET.  I AM IN A BIND BECAUSE I REALLY NEED MY CAR FOR WORK BUT I DO NOT HAVE $2,000 (NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY) TO FIX THIS CAR ONLY TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPEN AGAIN MONTHS FROM NOW.  ALSO, I HAVE NOTICED A STRONG GAS SMELL FROM THE CAR THAT HAS ME CONCERNED.  I HAVE READ SO MANY INTERNET POST FROM OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEMS.  THIS CAR SERIOUSLY NEED TO BE RECALLED BECAUSE IT IS ENDANGERING PEOPLE LIVES.  *KB",

ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON WHEN I PICKED IT UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP, SPOKE TO ONE OF THE REPS AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOTHING AND THAT THE ENGINE LIGHT WILL GO OUT SOON.  WELL IT DID ALONG WITH THE PANEL LIGHTS AND FLASHING RADIO LIGHT  ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER.  I REPLACED THE FUSES AND ASK THE MECHANICS AT EXPRESS LUBE TO CHECK MY FUSES ETC...OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING AND WAS OFFERING ME A CHANCE FOR THEIR MECHANIC TO LOOK AT IT FOR X AMOUNT OF DOLLARS...(TOO MUCH CASH).  SO I DROVE THE CAR AND FINALLY THE DASH LIGHTS CAME BACK ON FOR 3 TO 4 DAYS DURING JANUARY 2011.  BY MID MARCH, MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  I DROVE MY CAR WITH NO PROBLEM.  ON SUNDAY, APRIL 10, MY CAR DID A JERK WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE; TODAY, APRIL 12, I LEFT MY HEAD LIGHTS ON AND TRIED TO CHARGE MY DEAD CAR WITH BATTERY CABLES.  AS I TURNED THE SWITCH, A BURNT WIRE SMELL HAD AROUSED IN MID AIR AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.  NEXT, SMOKE BEGIN TO BLOW OUT FROM MY CD PLAYER.  MY SON, HIS FRIEND AND OTHER TEACHERS WERE AROUND MY CAR AT THIS TIME.  I AM THANKFUL THAT THE CAR DID NOT CATCH A FIRE.  *TR",

FURTHER, THE COST OF $98 PLUS TAX FOR THE UPGRADED THERMOSTAT HOUSING SHOULD NOT PASSED ON TO THE OWNER/CUSTOMER.  GM SHOULD REFUND THAT COST AND/OR RECALL THE VEHICLES FOR FREE REPLACEMENT.

THE AVEO HAS A FEATURE CALLED THE \"SHIFT LOCK RELEASE\" WHICH IS A HOLE ON THE SHIFTER CONSOLE YOU CAN PUT A SCREWDRIVER OR OTHER TOOL INTO TO RELEASE THE SHIFTER INTO DRIVE IN THESE SITUATIONS. I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND MAKE IT HOME SAFELY AFTER USING THE SHIFT LOCK RELEASE BUT WHEN I GOT HOME I REALIZED MY KEY WAS STUCK IN THE IGNITION. MY CAR SAT UNLOCKED OVERNIGHT BECAUSE I COULD NOT GET THE KEY OUT. ON MONDAY I CALLED MY LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP IN SALEM, OH AND THEY STATED THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY CAR UNTIL TUESDAY. I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY RESEARCHING ONLINE AND FOUND MANY CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE AVEO. LATER ON IN THE EVENING I REALIZED MY BRAKE LIGHTS WEREN'T WORKING BUT THERE WAS NOT A BLOWN FUSE OR SWITCH. I TESTED BOTH OF THE BRAKE LIGHTS AND THEY WERE STILL GOOD. ON TUESDAY I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT COST ME $80 FOR THE MECHANIC TO TELL ME THE SHIFTER IS BAD, WHICH I ALREADY KNEW. THEY ALSO STATED IT WOULD BE $300 TO REPAIR THE SHIFTER. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THE FAILURE OF THE BRAKE LIGHTS, THE SHIFTER AND THE IGNITION ARE TIED TOGETHER AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY GM AT NO COST TO ME. MY VEHICLE IS SITTING UNATTENDED WITH THE KEY IN IT, WHICH RUNS THE RISK OF IT BEING STOLEN. NOT TO MENTION WHEN I AM DRIVING I HAVE NO BRAKE LIGHTS TO ALERT THE OTHER DRIVERS I AM SLOWING DOWN OR STOPPING WHICH COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. EACH TIME I ATTEMPT TO PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE I HAVE TO INSERT SOMETHING INTO THE SHIFT LOCK RELEASE TO SHIFT THE CAR AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE SUNDAY.  *TR",

CHEVY SAID THAT THEY HAD TIGHTENED SOMETHING IN THE FRONT END TO TIGHT AT THE FACTORY AND THAT THEY HAD 3 OR 4 AVEOS COME BACK WITH THIS PROBLEM. THEY LOOSENED THEY TWO PIECES BUT I STILL HEAR THE SQUEAKS AND THEY TELL ME THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE BACK END THAT IS GRINDING BUT IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANY THING.  AND THEY HOPE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. IF IT DOES AS LONG AS IT IS UNDER WARRANTY THEY WILL FIX IT. BUT I WOULD HATE FOR SOMETHING TO BREAK AND ME BE GOING 70 AND IT BREAK.  *NM",
