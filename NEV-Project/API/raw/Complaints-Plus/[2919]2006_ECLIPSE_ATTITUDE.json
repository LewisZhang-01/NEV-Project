THE WEIGHT OF THE COACH OVER THE 3 AXLE SPAN IS BREAKING THE WELD AND CRUSHING THE TUBING DUE TO THOSE EXTRA 2 INCHES IT NEEDS.   ECLIPSE MANUFACTURING REFERRED ME TO LIPPERT COMPONENTS FOR REPAIR OF THE CHASSIS. LIPPERT COMPONENTS, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE CHASSIS, HAS DECLINED ANY WARRANTY OR REPAIR SINCE THE 1ST YEAR WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. BOTH MANUFACTURES HAVE DENIED ANY CLAIMS. FAILURE ON THE HIGHWAY  COULD CAUSE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES, INJURY, AND POSSIBLE DEATH. AS OF NOW, THE WHEEL WELLS ARE 2 1/2 INCHES OUT OF SQUARE CAUSING TIRE RUB TO OCCUR AT TIMES. ALSO, THE DOOR IS HARD TO OPEN, THE ROOFLINE OVER THE WHEEL WELLS HAS STARTED TO LEAK (MEANING IT IS SEPARATING AT THE SEAMS INCLUDING THE FRONT CORNERS). THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE OWNER SINCE NEW PURCHASE. NO COLLISION DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED AND HAS BEEN USED ABOUT 4 TIMES A YEAR SINCE 2006. IT REMAINS IN STORAGE WHEN NOT IN USE. IT IS STILL IN VERY GOOD SHAPE FOR BEING 11 YEARS OLD.  HOWEVER, THE CHASSIS SHOULD BE THE LAST THING TO GO WRONG FOR  A TOY HAULER.",
