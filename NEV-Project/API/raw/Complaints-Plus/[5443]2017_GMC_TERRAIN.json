I HAD BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN BUT DID NOT REALIZE THE DRIVER AHEAD WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN BUT STOPPED. I SWERVED TO THE RIGHT AND AS NOTED IN PICS BELOW THE DRIVERS SIDE OF CAR HIT THE OTHER DRIVERS PASSENGER BACK CORNER. I ENDED UP IN A PARKING LOT ON THAT CORNER. OTHER THEN THE MEDICAL TERM COOP TO COOP THAT ALSO AIDED IN MY HEAD INJURY, I ALSO HIT MY HEAD 2 TIMES AT MY HAIRLINE ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THEN MY LEFT CHEEK. I WAS DIAGNOSED AND SUSTAINED A SEVERE CONCUSSION/ BRAIN TRAUMA. I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TWICE FOR CARE OF WORSENING SYMPTOMS AND WAS INCAPACITATED AND OUT OF WORK FOR ABOUT 6 WKS. WHICH WAS STILL TO FAST TO RETURN, BUT I COULD NOT AFFORD BEING ON DISABILITY. FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE CITY TOW YARD, AND WAS ASSESSED WITHIN A WEEK BY THE  INS ADJUSTER AS TOTAL LOSS. FROM THERE IT WAS TAKEN TO A JUNK SALVAGE BUSINESS. DUE TO MY INCAPACITATION I HAD NO MEANS TO LOOK INTO CONCERNS RELATED TO WHY THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I AM  A NURSE PRACTITIONER THAT NOW HAS SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS, MIGRAINES, AND ATTENTION DEFICIT DUE TO THE BRAIN INJURY. I  HAVE NO WAY OF FINDING OUT IF THE AIRBAG  SENSORS WERE DEFECTIVE OR NOT BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH I'M ATTEMPTING TO TRACK THE CAR IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT, AND UNSURE OF MY RIGHTS TO THE CAR IF I CAN TRACK IT DOWN.
