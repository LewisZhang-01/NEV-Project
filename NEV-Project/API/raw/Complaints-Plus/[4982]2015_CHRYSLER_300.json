        "summary": "MY REAR SUNROOF EXPLODED. I WAS DRIVING DOWN A HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 55 MILES AN HOUR ON AN OVERCAST DAY WITH AN OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE OF APPROXIMATELY 52 DEGREES (F). MY WINDOWS WERE ALL CLOSED.  WHILE DRIVING I HEARD A BIG BANG, AND WITHIN SECONDS I NOTICED THAT ME REAR SUNROOF HAD A LARGE HOLE IN IT.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE THE CAR DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE CAR 15 MONTHS AGO. THEY INSPECTED THE DAMAGE AND NOTED THAT IT WAS AN OUTWARD EXPLOSION AS THE REMAINING GLASS IN THE SUNROOF WAS PUSHED OUT, NOT IN. THEY ALSO INSPECTED THE CAR FOR ANY SIGNS THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE EXPLODED WITHIN THE CAR AND SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF - THERE WERE ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH SIGNS. THE CAR DEALERSHIP CONTACTED CHRYSLER TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER THE DAMAGE AS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE RESULT OF SUBSTANDARD GLASS OR A DESIGN FLAW.  CHRYSLER DENIED COVERAGE.  I SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR EXPLODING SUNROOFS AND FOUND OUT THAT MY EXPERIENCE WASN'T UNIQUE. THERE WERE MANY ACCOUNTS OF OTHER SUCH INCIDENCES, AND EVEN SOME RECALLS BY ONE OR TWO CAR MANUFACTURERS.      MY CONCERNS ARE:  1) SAFETY.  I WAS ALONE IN THE CAR, AND WAS NOT HURT.  HOWEVER, I'M NOT SURE IF I HAD BACKSEAT PASSENGERS IF THEY WOULD HAVE ESCAPED INJURY. I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY IF THE FRONT SUNROOF (OVER MY HEAD) WOULD HAVE EXPLODED INSTEAD OF THE REAR SUNROOF.  2) RESPONSIBILITY. THE DENIAL OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS INCIDENT BY CHRYSLER IS TROUBLING.  I STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY AND EVEN PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS VEHICLE. THIS EXPLOSION WAS OBVIOUSLY CREATED BY A DESIGN FLAW OR THE USE OF SUBSTANDARD GLASS.  3) COST.  THOUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN,  I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RATHER EXPENSIVE REPAIR.   *TR",
