After about 2 years, I noticed that the Low Beam lighting was not as bright as it use to be (it never seemed exceptionally bright in the first place).  Over the next few years, it appeared to be getting worse.  I replaced the bulbs with the appropriate aftermarket, higher lumen rated halogen bulbs, that improved it a little bit, but not very much.  The low beam lighting was much worse than my 2004 Acura TL at time.  I have also read the reports from other owners and my mechanic also received similar complaints from RDX customers.   I am taking my car in today to have the headlight assemblies replaced and installing aftermarket halogen bulbs ($>1,000) to hopefully improve exterior lighting so we can drive the car safely at night.  Note, we have not taken our 2013 Acura RDX out at night in over 5 years as it's just not safe.",

I purchased new bulbs with a higher lumen rating than the OEM bulbs. No change. I have spoken with a master mechanic and a parts supplier. They could offer no solutions. I have read several blogs that all have the same theme: the Acura RDX models from 2013-2015 all have terrible headlight components that truly compromise driving at night and could very possibly be a significant contribution to an accident. According to Acura, they don't regard this issue as a problem they should address and the dealers want a small fortune to replace the entire headlight assembly. To do the replacement myself would still cost between $500-$700. For the reputation of the brand and the price I paid - even for a USED vehicle - it seems unconscionable that Acura will take zero responsibility for inherently flawed components and design.

This involved a safety issue that could have resulted in serious injury to me and other drivers on the road. As I was traveling on a very busy street in Miami, FL at a speed of 45 MPH, my steering wheel suddenly became very heavy and hard to turn which made me have no control over my vehicle. I eventually pulled to the side of the road almost hitting not only the car in front of me but a pedestrian on the sidewalk. I did not understand what was going on as I have never encountered this situation in my life. I then could not move my vehicle because my steering wheel was heavy, and then there were a lot of flashing indicator lights like \u201ccheck power steering\u201d and other codes. As I sat there, a bit in shock, I tried to move the steering wheel, but it would not move at all, so I had to have the vehicle towed because it was unsafe to drive.   As I started to research what had happened to my vehicle, there were several reported cases re: the same issues with the electronic power steering (EPS) control unit failing while driving. There were several detailed customer complaints on Acura customer owners\u2019 forums. In addition, I found several reported cases on Acura service bulletins, one of which was the service bulletin 19-021.   This has been a frustrating and nerve wrecking experience. I maintain my vehicle by following the service/maintenance manual and have been a proactive vehicle owner by investing in the upkeep. However, this does not seem to fall within the purview of what I have ever experienced in the past and concerns me that my SAFETY was jeopardized, so that is why I am reaching out to your organization.",

THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT. THE VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MAINTAINED BY MYSELF, OR AN ACURA/HONDA DEALERSHIP. MY PROBLEM ARE THE HEADLIGHTS. I CAN NOT SEE MUCH WITH THEM ANYMORE. I HAVE NEVER PUT ANY AFTERMARKET LED TYPE OR OTHER BULBS, NOR HAVE THEY EVER BEEN ALTERED IN ANY WAY. I REPLACED THE BULBS (WITH OEM STYLE) THINKING IT WAS THE BULBS THEMSELVES, WITH THE SAME RESULTS. IN ANY INCLEMENT WEATHER, ESPECIALLY RAIN, OR WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC, I SEE LESS. I UNDERSTAND ONCOMING TRAFFIC WILL LESSEN WHAT A DRIVER SEES, BUT THIS IS BEYOND NORMAL. THE LENSES ON MY VEHICLE ARE ALSO CLEAR (NOT YELLOW FROM YEARS OF SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE). THE VEHICLE IS ALWAYS GARAGE-KEPT, WHEN AT HOME. FROM MY RESEARCH, THE HEADLIGHT REFLECTORS INSIDE THE HOUSING, DETERIORATE. THIS CAUSES VERY LITTLE LIGHT TO REFLECT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IF THIS IS CONSIDERED \"WEAR AND TEAR\", I WOULD FIX THIS ISSUE MYSELF. BUT TO ME, I FEEL THAT THIS A TERRIBLE DESIGN, THAT ACURA SHOULD FIX. MY INABILITY TO SEE WHILE DRIVING, IS A HAZARD. I CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN MY VEHICLE AS REQUIRED. I HAVE A DIFFERENT VEHICLE THAT WAS BOUGHT NEW, IN 2003 AND NOW HAS 230K MILES, NO PROBLEMS. I MAINTAIN MY VEHICLES WELL!    I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY SEVERAL THOUSANDS TO HAVE THE HEADLIGHTS FIXED ON MY ACURA, OR TO TRADE THE ACURA IN, AS A REASON TO GET RID OF A KNOWN ISSUE. I HAVE INVESTED IN THE ACURA, TO KEEP IT RUNNING AT ITS BEST. WHEN I BOUGHT THE ACURA, MY PLAN WAS TO KEEP IT FOR 15 YEARS OR MORE, IF POSSIBLE. I AM DOING MY PART, AS MUCH AS I CAN. I REACHED OUT TO ACURA, WITH NO HELP. MY ONLY HOPE, IS THAT THIS ISSUE IS INVESTIGATED, AND FOR ACURA TO HELP ME WITH THIS SAFETY DESIGN FLAW.    THANK YOU IN ADVANCE   GABRIEL COLO",

I CAME TO A RED LIGHT ON A TOWN STREET IN MIDDLEBURY, VT AND LET THE CAR NATURALLY DECELERATE.  AS I APPROACHED THE CAR AHEAD OF ME, MY RDX VERY SUDDENLY SURGED FORWARD AND ACCELERATED.  IT ACCELERATED VERY NOTICEABLY. FORTUNATELY, I BRAKED AND SWERVED IN TIME SO AS TO NOT REAR-END THE VEHICLE AHEAD OF ME.  THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT MY CAR HAS DONE THIS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS NEARLY IN AND JUST AVOIDED A COLLISION.  I LOVE MY CAR.  HOWEVER, I AM FRIGHTENED THAT I MAY INJURE MYSELF, A PASSENGER OR EVEN WORSE, ANOTHER DRIVER OR PEDESTRIAN.  ALITTLE VEHICLE HISTORY ... I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AN ACURA DEALER IN SOUTH BURLINGTON, VT ONLY 4 MONTHS AGO IN FEBRUARY 2020.  THE VEHICLE HAD 65 THOUSAND MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  IN THE NEARLY 4 MONTHS THAT I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE, I HAVE PUT 3 THOUSAND MILES ON THE RDX.  PRESENTLY, THE ACURA HAS 68 THOUSAND MILES ON IT.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE MANAGER [XXX].

AFTER 55MPH IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.  CALLED CREST ACURA AND WAS TOLD THAT IT IS THE \"DEACTIVATION OF CYLINDERS AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.\"  I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC WHO STATED IT SHOULD NOT DO THAT.    TOOK VEHICLE TO CREST ACURA ON 2/13/14 TO ADDRESS THE BLUE TOOTH THAT IS AWFUL AND HAD A TECHNICIAN RIDE WITH ME TO FEEL THE VIBRATION.  THE TECH SAID THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE VIBRATION BUT ACURA HAS NOT COME UP WITH A FIX FOR IT.  HE STATED HE HAD A CALL INTO ACURA.  I WAS TOLD ONCE AGAIN THAT IT IS NORMAL FOR THE VEHICLE TO DO THAT BY THE SERVICE MANAGER.  THE BLUETOOTH COMPLAINT IS:  I CAN HEAR FINE WITH IT BUT PEOPLE CANT HEAR ME.  THEY REPLACED THE BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE ON 2/21/14 BUT IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD LIKE ACURA TO ADDRESS THESE 2 ISSUES AS I AM NOT THE ONLY ACURA RDX CUSTOMER TO HAVE THESE ISSUES.
