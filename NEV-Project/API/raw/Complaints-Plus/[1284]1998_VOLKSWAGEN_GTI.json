I ALSO NOTICED THAT MY WIPERS AND MY FAN ALSO STOPPED WORKING.  I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND TURNED THE CAR BACK ON AGAIN, ALL WAS FINE FOR ABOUT 10 SEC., THEN IT WENT OUT AGAIN.  I NOTICED THAT WHEN I TOUCHED THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION THAT IT WENT BACK ON AGAIN, AND I HELD THE KEY FORWARD AND HELD IT THERE, AND THE HEADLIGHTS, WIPERS, AND THE FAN STARTED TO WORK AGAIN.  WHEN I LET IT GO, IT STOPPED WORKING.  I HAD TO HOLD THE KEY IN THE IGNITION FORWARD ALL THE WAY HOME TO HAVE HEADLIGHTS TO SEE MY WAY HOME.  THE NEXT DAY I CHECKED AGAIN AND KNEW FOR SURE THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS THE PROBLEM, IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I LOOKED IT UP ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON ON VOLKSWAGEN GOLF'S OR GTI'S AND THAT THERE WASN'T A RECALL ON THIS DANGEROUS DEFECT.  I OWN A 1998 VOLKSWAGEN GTI.  THANK YOU, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF THIS PROBLEM WAS ADDRESSED TO VOLKSWAGEN AND A RECALL WERE TO BE MADE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HEARD IT COST'S A LOT OF MONEY TO REPLACE THE IGNITION SWITCH.*JB",
