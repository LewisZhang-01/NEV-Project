I lost control of my car, almost flipped and thought it was a blowout, while trying to come to a stop on the highway and nowhere to pullover. 18wheelers all  around me and I had no choice but to stop on left small shoulder.  At this time we realized that my tire had not blown, but ALL the Tread had separated from the tire. It had separated and this caused roughly 6feet of extreme whipping of tread while separating from the tube part of tire was beating my car in multiple areas under the car, damaged and took off half of my bumper, tore up the passenger side back and front door while causing large dents.  I called a tow truck while my daughter called my husband to help us. Tow driver stated he hadn\u2019t seen that happen and we were very lucky something catastrophic didn\u2019t happen,  Myself and my daughters life was in great risk!! We almost flipped the car due to tire separation, and we could\u2019ve caused a multi car accident!   My car had to go to the collision center ( Caliber Collision ) which is a vendor my insurance company works with - they have taken multiple photos of the damage. I have also taken multiple photos of damage.   It has not been inspected by authorities etc\u2026 yet.  No warning lights representing tire pressure, concerns etc\u2026.were alerting me of anything to be concerned of.  The interior passenger airbag light was stating airbag was off - which caused for more concern ( I am driving a 2016 Audi A3 with a National recall & no fix!! ) with if we would\u2019ve crashed, rolled, wrecked into someone/something that the airbags would\u2019ve potentiality not gone off to protect my daughter or myself!",

It has done this at a stop and also on the highway going 75.  I have had to pullover many times. I am so scared something is going to happen.

They have stopped making all A 3\u2019s and pulled them all off the lots! This is huge and tells me it is VERY serious and something has to be done!!!
