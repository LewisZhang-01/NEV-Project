However, the extension has expired despite the fact that many Honda owners continue to experience this problem (see https://www.8thcivic.com/threads/documenting-cracked-engine-block-for-those-out-of-the-warranty-coverage.609546/page-7). This issue should be considered more serious than just an extended warranty, as an engine leaking coolant could easily overheat and cause serious problems on a road trip, especially in the part of the country I live in (Montana), where summers are hot and dry and wildfires are easily ignited. The Carfax report for the vehicle I own--which I purchased used in September 2021--suggested that this would be the perfect vehicle to buy, with a regular maintenance history and lower-than-usual mileage. No indication at all of an extended warranty or potential issues that I should be aware of. Fortunately a friend discovered the issue when he noticed coolant leaking when he changed a tire for me rather than me discovering it while driving to Colorado or Michigan to visit family, when the engine may have indeed leaked enough coolant without me noticing to cause serious problems. I am attaching the report from the mechanic who diagnosed the issue, which I sent to Honda to open a case for assistance with a repair (which they declined, citing the expiration of the extended warranty).",

Honda addressed this issue by extending the warranty discreetly to 10 years with unlimited mileage. This warranty extension was clearly designed to target owners who had more drive time than others.  The bulletin posted here -> https://static.oemdtc.com/TSB/A10-048.pdf states it was posted in January of 2015. That means my well-cared-for 2007 Civic had only two years to encounter the issue, or else the replacement would not be honored. I purchased the car in 2019 used, and did not realize the engine was to be faulty. Not even 50k miles into the car's life the engine block failed, almost catastrophically. This leak could have lead to a fire hazard had I not been paying attention to the car's temperature.  This is absolutely abysmal practice for a parts+labor fix that costs $5000+ due to a faulty designed engine. Honda doesn't even partially cover these costs despite knowing and acknowledging their issue in a poor fashion. To only provide repairs for people who encountered the issue when they knew it would keep coming up for owners after their warranties is completely unfair and should not be allowed, especially when lives are potentially at stake from the damage such a fault may cause.",

We pulled off to the side of the road and were immediately able to retrieve the broken piece.  I still have the broken piece in my possession, and I could mail it to an investigator if desired.  Photos of the broken axle piece are also attached, together with a dealer repair invoice which lists the Honda part numbers for the replacement parts (due to an availability issue, the dealer used non-OEM parts to perform the repair, whose part numbers may or may not match the original OEM part numbers).  It's clear from inspection that the broken driveshaft was initially covered by an anti-rust coating (portions of the coating are still visibly adhered), however most of this coating wore away and the underlying metal was substantially corroded by salt, which ultimately caused the part to fail.  This vehicle has been registered in the state of Massachusetts (a so-called \"salt-belt\" state) for at least as long as I have owned it (since 2010) and possibly before that as well.  The failure mode of the driveshaft (i.e., salt corrosion and breakage due to a failed anti-rust coating) precisely matches the failure mode described in an existing NHTSA Recall Notice: 20V-770, which covers this same part.  This existing recall notice already applies to several other Honda vehicles in \"salt-belt\" states, however it does not yet extend to my specific model and year.  Given the close similarities between the failure in my vehicle, and the existing recall notice, I would like to ask the NHTSA to further extend recall 20V-770 to incorporate my vehicle as well.",

MANY OF THE PEOPLE ENCOUNTERING THIS PROBLEM ARE OF LOW INCOME, FEW OF WHICH CANNOT AFFORD REPAIR COSTS AND/OR PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE; WE PURCHASE THESE TYPE OF CARS FOR THEIR SO-CALLED RELIABILITY. IN MY CASE, I AM A UNIVERSITY STUDENT WHO VITALLY NEEDS A SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION. ONE MAY ARGUE THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT LIMITS MY POSSIBILITY FRONTIER AS I ALSO HAVE TO WORK; PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COSTS TIME ONE COULD BE USING ELSEWHERE.  TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS DEFECT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC. THERE IS HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN ENGINE OVERHEATING AND ACCIDENTS THAT ARE WORRISOME.",

SO, I DECIDED TO FILE A FORMAL CLAIM WITH HONDA AND AFTER GOING BACK AND FORTH FOR A WEEK AND A HALF THEY AGREED TO PAY 50% OF THE COST TO REPLACE THE ENGINE BLOCK, WHICH MEANT THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE TO PAY $2,658.75 TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. I FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD HAVE COVERED THE ENGINE BLOCK REPLACEMENT 100% FREE OF CHARGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE WAS DUE TO A MANUFACTURES DEFECT. ALSO, THE CAR IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, HAS LOW MILES, AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS PURCHASED AT. AS A CUSTOMER, WHO PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW, I FEEL THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO INVEST MONEY ON REPLACING THE MOTOR DUE TO A DEFECT. THE CUSTOMER SHOULD ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE .  I HAVE ATTACHED MY REPAIR BILL WHICH LISTS THE ISSUE/FIX AND THE AMOUNT I WAS CHARGED AS PROOF.  THANK YOU AND I HOPE THIS HELPS OTHERS!",

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEAN HONDA AT PITTSBURGH WHERE THEY PERFORMED THE DIAGNOSIS TO FIND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS CRACK IN THE ENGINE BLOCK WHICH HAS CAUSED THE COOLANT TO LEAK FROM THE ENGINE AND HENCE OVERHEATING OF THE ENGINE HAS HAPPENED.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE HAS TO BE REPLACED AND FEW OTHER PARTS AS WELL (LIKE SPARK PLUG ETC.) TO MAKE THE CAR RUNNING AGAIN WHICH WOULD COST ME AROUND $4000.      I DID SOME RESEARCH OVER THE INTERNET REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT MOST OF THE 2006 TO 2009 CIVICS HAD THE ENGINE CRACK ISSUE AND TSB 10-048 WAS ISSUED AND THE WARRANTY OF SUCH ENGINES WERE EXTENDED TO 10 YEARS AND THAT WOULD COVER THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE IF SUCH ISSUES ARE FOUND.     I CHECKED WITH MY SERVICE CONSULTANT AT DEAN HONDA IF THIS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. HE DID A VIN INQUIRY AND SAID THE WARRANT HAS EXPIRED 10 DAYS AGO AND THIS WON'T BE COVERED. (THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE DATE OF THE CAR WAS 22-AUG-2007 AND THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED TO ME ON 31-AUG-2017). THIS IS A BIG BLOW TO ME.     THIS IS MY FIRST CAR IN THE US. I BOUGHT THIS CAR AS THE SECOND OWNER IN JULY 2015 WITH ONLY 36000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE HARDLY DRIVEN 15000 MILES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER ALSO NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH IT AND THAT'S WHY I PURCHASED IT WITH CONFIDENCE.     CONSIDERING CUSTOMER'S SAFETY, THESE ENGINES NEEDS TO BE RECALLED BY HONDA AND REPLACED WITH NEW ONES OR AT LEAST THE WARRANTY OF THESE ENGINES NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED FURTHER (FOR AT LEAST FOR 5 MORE YEARS).

PROBLEM AGAIN WITH #4 CYLINDER.  REPLACED ALL SPARK PLUGS AND ENGINE AIR FILTER.  ONE WEEK LATER, HEATER STOPPED WORKING.  NEXT DAY, RADIATOR (COOLANT) GAUGE ON DASH MOVED UP PAST MID-POINT AND HITS 3/4 POINT.  I STOPPED DRIVING AND HAD A FRIEND BRING COOLANT WHICH WAS 1 GAL LOW!  (NOTE:  MECHANIC CHECKED AND FOUND COOLANT LEVEL FULL WHEN CAR WAS IN FOR ENGINE LIGHT PROBLEM LESS THAN A 10 DAYS PREVIOUSLY.  I DRIVE LESS THAN 15 MILES PER DAY...ALL LOW SPEED.  I PARK OFF STREET AND HAVE CAR IN ONE SPOT FOR 9 HOURS DURING WORK AND NEVER SAW ANY FLUID ON PARKING SPOT.)  ADDED COOLANT.  1 WEEK LATER (COOLANT) GAUGE ON DASH MOVED UP PAST MID-POINT AND HIT 3/4 POINT (AFTER DRIVING 5 MILES AT 45 M.P.H. OR LESS).  STOPPED DRIVING.  CHECKED COOLANT LEVEL WHICH WAS FINE (FULL).  THAT NIGHT GOT LETTER IN MAIL FROM HONDA SAYING THAT 2006 - 2009 CIVICS MAY HAVE CRACKED ENGINE BLOCKS.  ALL \"SYMPTOMS\" DESCRIBED IN HONDA LETTER MATCHED WHAT I HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING (UNEXPLAINED/UNDETECTED COOLANT LOSS, OVERHEATING, ENGINE PROBLEM AS EVIDENCED BY DASH INDICATOR).  BROUGHT CAR TO HONDA DEALER.  THEY SAID NO PROBLEM WITH ENGINE BLOCK.  I ASKED THEM TO CHECK RADIATOR THERMOSTAT.  THEY SAID NO PROBLEM.  THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY I LOST COOLANT.  I AM IN PROCESS OF GETTING SECOND OPINION BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HONDA IS COMMITTED TO FIXING THE PROBLEM (WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT).  *TR",

I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE UP THE COACH'S DRIVEWAY BUT AT APPROXIMATELY THE HALFWAY POINT, MY HONDA CIVIC HYBRID STOPPED MOVING FORWARD ALTHOUGH THE ACCELERATOR WAS PUSHED TO THE FLOOR.  I HAD THE TWO NINE YEAR OLD KIDS EXIT THE VEHICLE BUT IT STILL DID NOT MOVE FORWARD.  I SLOWLY BACKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE UP THE DRIVEWAY AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH A RUNNING START.  AGAIN, MY HONDA CIVIC HYBRID DID NOT MAKE IT UP THE DRIVEWAY.  I ESTIMATE THE DRIVEWAY TO BE AT A 30% ANGLE, NOT STEEP BUT DEFINITELY NOT FLAT.  AGAIN I SLOWLY BACKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AFTER HAVING THE CARS BEHIND ME MOVE OUT OF MY WAY.  I PARKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVEWAY AND WALKED UP THE HILL, NOT SOMETHING YOU EXPECT TO DO WHEN YOU SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR A VEHICLE.  ON OCTOBER 3, 2012, I HAD A CERTIFIED HONDA DEALERSHIP EXAMINE THE CAR AS I SUSPECTED THE IMA BATTERY WAS FAULTY.  THE DEALER STATED I DID NEED A NEW 12 VOLT BATTERY AND I HAD THE BATTERY REPLACED.  THE DEALER STATED THAT WHILE THE IMA BATTERY IS NOT GIVING OUT FULL POWER IT IS AT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.  THE DEALER STATED THAT HONDA REFUSES TO REPLACE ANY IMA BATTERY UNLESS IT COMPLETELY FAILS AND THEY HAVE SEEN SEVERAL CIVIC HYBRIDS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY CONCERN IS THE ACCELERATION AND LOSS OF POWER BECOMES A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE ON THE HIGHWAYS AND HILLS.  I HAVE THREE YOUNG KIDS AND DO NOT FEEL SAFE WITH THEM IN THE CAR.  I HAVE ALL SERVICE DOCUMENTATION AND AM WILLING TO LET INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE AND DRIVE MY VEHICLE.  ALSO, I CAN PROVIDE THE ADDRESS OF THE DRIVEWAY, THE VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT UP.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AS THIS LOSS OF POWER CREATES A SAFETY ISSUE FOR MY FAMILY.  *TR",

THEY STATED THE WHEEL BEARS AND SHOCKS LOOKED FINE AND THAT THE ALIGNMENT WASN'T THAT BAD.  I THEN TOOK THE CAR BACK TO DISCOUNT TIRE AND THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE PASSENGER-SIDE REAR TIRE FOR THE REPLACEMENT COST OF $13.25.

AFTER MANY RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSIS FROM HONDA PARTS AND SERVICE SHOP, DIFFERENT FIRESTONE LOCATIONS AND LOCAL MECHANICS, THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE UPPER/REAR CONTROL ARMS, FRONT AND REAR CAMBER ARM AND BOLTS ARE DEFECTIVE AS PER HONDA MANUFACTURERS.  MY TIRES ARE EXCESSIVELY AND UNEVENLY WEARING.  I HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT 6 SETS OF NEW TIRES IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS BECAUSE OF THIS HONDA ISSUE, WHICH THEY ADMIT IT IS A DEFECT MADE BY THE MANUFACTURERS.  THEY RELEASED A SERVICE BULLETIN (SERVICE BULLETIN 08-001 DATED APRIL 11, 2008) THAT INFORMS HONDA DEALER SHOP OF THIS ISSUE/DEFECT, BUT THEY REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF REPAIRING IT FREE OF CHARGE. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR THAT CUSTOMERS BUYING HONDAS HAVE TO PAY FOR DEFECTIVE PARTS MADE BY THE MANUFACTURERS.  I WOULD LIKE THESE DEFECT TO BE SOLVED AND PAID BY THEM AND I WOULD LIKE REFUND FOR AT LEAST THE LAST SET OF TIRES THAT I RECENTLY BOUGHT AND ARE ALREADY UNEVENLY WORN OUT (THIS MAKES IT A USELESS TIRE). IN CASE IT IS NEEDED I HAVE ALL THE PAPER WORK THAT CAN BE A CLEAR EVIDENCE TO THIS COMPLAINT.  LIKE ME, THERE ARE OTHER HONDA OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE.   *TR",

MANY TIMES THE CAR IS SLUGGISH TO START FROM A STOP, OR ACCELERATE, BUT IT DOES \"GO\", JUST NOT AS PROMPTLY AND QUICKLY AS IT SHOULD.  THE MOST RECENT INCIDENTS OCCURRED LAST MONTH AND HAS PROMPTED THIS COMPLAINT.  BOTH INVOLVED MERGING ONTO A FREEWAY.  IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, I WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE, WHICH I KNEW WOULD TURN EXIT ONLY A MILE OR SO DOWN THE ROAD.  THERE WAS A TRUCK ON MY LEFT, FOLLOWED BY A LONG LINE OF SLOW MOVING CARS.  SO I THOUGHT, SINCE THE TRUCK WAS RIGHT NEXT TO ME, I WOULD SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT AND BIT AND GET IN FRONT OF IT.  TO SPEED UP ONLY FAST ENOUGH TO PASS THIS TRUCK, MY CAR REVVED TO OVER 6000 RPM.  IT JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ACCELERATE NORMALLY.  I DID SAFELY MAKE THE LANE CHANGE IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK; THE WORST THING THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CASE WAS GETTING OFF AT AN EXIT I DID NOT INTEND TO GET OFF AT.  HOWEVER, THE NEXT DAY, I WAS MERGING ONTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC WITH A TYPICAL LANE LENGTH TO ALLOW MERGING.  MY CAR DIDN'T WANT TO ACCELERATE ENOUGH TO SAFELY ACCOMPLISH THE MERGE.  I HAD TO REV THE ENGINE UP TO OVER 5000 RPM JUST TO GET UP TO BARELY 45 MPH TO ACCOMPLISH THE MERGE.  I FEEL IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I GET INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS ACCELERATION ISSUE.  *TR",

OVER THE PAST YEAR TWO REPAIR PLACES THAT HAVE REPLACED MY OIL HAVE TOLD ME THE TIRE WEAR WAS DUE TO WORN OUT STRUTS.  THIS SPRING THE DEALER FINALLY TOLD ME IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS AND IT WOULD COST CLOSE TO $400 TO REPLACE THEM.    MY AIRBAG SENSOR LIGHT HAD BEEN ON MOST OF THE TIME FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THE HONDA DEALER TOLD ME DURING THIS VISIT THAT THIS IS ALSO A COMMON PROBLEM AND IF I DIDN'T GET IT FIXED MY AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.  THIS PROBLEM WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENT OF A WIRE HARNESS FOR NEARLY $1300.  I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA TO SEE IF THERE WERE RECALLS FOR THESE PROBLEMS AND THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS FOR $75 AND THE WIRING HARNESS FOR $375 BUT I ONLY HAD 60 DAYS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS FOR THIS PRICE.  I GOT THE ARMS REPLACED BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET NEW TIRES OR REPLACE THE HARNESS.  I HAVE NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF TRACTION AND THE NOISE AND VIBRATION ARE SO BAD NOW THAT I CAN HARDLY DRIVE THE CAR.

IT IS TRUE THAT IT DID GO THROUGH THE IMA BATTERY RECONDITIONING CYCLE OCCASIONALLY, BUT NOT VERY OFTEN    THE SECOND, A CIVIC HYBRID, WAS ALSO QUITE SATISFACTORY.    THE THIRD, A 2007 CIVIC HYBRID, IS THE PROBLEM. I WISH I HAD NEVER TRADED UP (DOWN?) TO IT. AG AN EARLY POINT THE COMPUTER INDICATED AN IMA PROBLEM, AND THE SERVICE PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT THE COMPUTER INDICATED THAT THE IMA BATTERY WAS MALFUNCTIONING. YOUR EXPERTS REQUIRED THAT THE COMPUTER BE REPROGRAMMED SO THAT THE COMPUTER NO LONGER REPORTED THE IMA PROBLEM. I CONTINUE TO BE TOLD THAT SINCE THE COMPUTER SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG THERE IS NOTING THAT THE DEALER CAN DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM.     AT PRESENT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX TIMES EACH DAY THE INDICATOR FOR IMA CHARGE DROPS TO 2 AND THE IMA STOPS PROVIDING ASSIST WAITING FOR THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. AFTER A WHILE THE CHARGE INDICATOR JUMPS UP TO FULL, USUALLY WITH DO PARTIAL FULL STEPS, AND THEN THE BOOST RESUMES WORK. HOWEVER IF I CLIMB ANY REASONABLE HILL ON THE HIGHWAY THE CHARGE INDICATOR DROPS TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS NO BOOST. IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BATTERY WILL NOT HOLD A PROPER CHARGE. IT IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A SAFETY PROBLEM SINCE WHEN STARTING UP IN TRAFFIC I CANNOT RELY ON THE IMA BOOST TO BE THERE WHEN NEEDED.    QUITE HONESTLY, I THINK IT IS LONG PAST TIME FOR YOU TO HONOR THE WARRANTY AND REPLACE THE IMA BATTERY. IF THERE IS SOME OTHER CAUSE FOR THE PROBLEM, THEN IT NEEDS FIXING.

WE TOOK IT TO THE HONDA DEALER AND WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE UPPER REAR CONTROL ARMS AND THEY WOULD REPLACE THEM AND PRORATE THE REAR TIRES.  AT THAT TIME I ELECTED TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES AND ASSUMED THAT HONDA HAD FIXED THE DEFECT.      AFTER 25,000 MILES, THE ROAR IS BACK AND I AGAIN HAVE CUPPED TIRES ON THE REAR.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AS EVENTUALLY THIS SUSPENSION DEFECT COULD LEAD TO EITHER TIRE FAILURE AND/OR LOSS OF CONTROL WHILE DRIVING.      HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM (SERVICE BULLETIN 08-001) BUT TOLD US WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE DEALER THAT IT WAS AN ALIGNMENT ISSUE.  WHILE POOR ALIGNMENT CAN LEAD TO CUPPED TIRES, I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING BULLETIN BOARDS ON THE INTERNET AND SEE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT OTHERS ARE STILL EXPERIENCING TIRE WEAR THAT RESULTS IN CUPPED TIRES AFTER THE 15,000 TO 25,000 MILES ON TIRES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST 60,000 TO 75,000 MILES.      MY DAUGHTER DRIVES THIS CAR TO AND FROM COLLEGE AND HAS NOT HAD A MAJOR FAILURE YET.

SPECIFICALLY, IT APPEARS THAT 2007 HONDA CIVIC REAR ENDS WILL \"DRAG\" THE REAR TIRES DOWN THE ROAD IF THE THERE ARE REAR PASSENGERS OR CARGO.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SUSPENSION IS INCORRECTLY DESIGNED AND REAR TIRES DO NOT TRACK CORRECTLY WHEN THE CAR HAS  LOAD IN THE REAR OR TRUNK.

I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL DEALER AND SINCE THE UPDATE HAS BEEN INSTALLED THE CAR IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE WHEN ENTERING THE FREEWAY. THE FAILURE TO ACCELERATE HAPPENS EVERYTIME I ENTER THE FREEWAY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FAILURE IS THAT CARS BEHIND COME UP ON ME VERY FAST AND I HAVE NO POWER TO GET IN THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. IT HAS LITTLE ACCELERATION TO MATCH TRAFFIC FLOW. IT SEEMS THE CAR IS MOSTLY OPERATING ON THE SMALL ENGINE AND HAS LITTLE ASSIST FROM THE BATTERY,SINCE THE UPDATE HAS BEEN INSTALLED.I CALLED AMERICAN HONDA THEY SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE UPDATE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR AND THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING REGARDING MY  CONCERNS.  I FEEL THIS CAR IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. AS WELL ,HONDA SAID THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE WARRANTY ON THE BATTERY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE CHANGED HOW THE BATTERY OPERATES SINCE THEY HAVE INSTALLED THE UPDATE. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER TELLING HONDA TO RECALL THIS CAR AND MAKE IT SAFE TO DRIVE. I WANT MY CAR TO RUN THE WAY IT DID BEFORE THE SOFTWARE WAS INSTALLED. A SIDE COMPLAINT IS THAT THE GOOD GAS MILEAGE I GOT ON A TANK OF GAS AS DROPPED CONSIDERABLY SINCE THE UPDATE..  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON TAKING ON THIS COMPLAINT..  P.S. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENT. I FILED THIS COMPLAINT SO THAT THERE IS NONE IN THE FUTURE. THE INCIDENT DATE OF AUGUST 11,2010 IS THE DATE THE NEW SOFTWARE WAS INSTALLED IN MY CAR. *TR",

RECENTLY THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED BY HONDA TO HAVE THE IMA SOFTWARE UPDATED AT ANY HONDA DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE BULLETIN DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THE ELECTRIC BATTERY NOT CHARGING PROPERLY AND NO/MINIMAL ASSIST FROM THE IMA SYSTEM WHEN ACCELERATING. THERE IS NO CHANGE IN HOW THE CAR IS PERFORMING AFTER THE SOFTWARE UPDATE AND THE MPG HAS GONE DOWN FROM 42 TO 32 MPG. THE ELECTRIC BATTERY IS NOT CHARGING AS IT USED TO INITIALLY AND THERE IS HARDLY ANY ASSIST WHEN ACCELERATING. MY WIFE AND I HAVE ALMOST GOTTEN INTO REALLY BAD ACCIDENTS WHEN TRYING TO MERGE ON THE FREEWAY. WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE ELECTRIC BATTERY, THE CAR HAS LITERALLY NO ACCELERATION. ON A FEW OCCASIONS WE WERE ALMOST RUN OVER BY SEMI'S BECAUSE WE COULDN'T MERGE WITH THE TRAFFIC FAST ENOUGH. I'VE REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO MULTIPLE DEALERSHIPS IN BAY AREA CA BUT THEY INSISTED THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE HYBRID BATTERIES. THEY STATE THAT IF THERE IS A PROBLEM THEN A WARNING LIGHT SHOULD COME UP ON THE DASHBOARD INDICATING THE PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE LIGHT IS NOT COMING ON BUT I PROVED TO MULTIPLE DEALERS THAT THE BATTERY CHARGE DOES NOT HOLD. THEY SAW HOW THE CAR WAS BEHAVING BUT SAID THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TILL THE VEHICLE'S ONBOARD COMPUTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE IMA SYSTEM. I THEN CONTACTED HONDA USA AND REPORTED THE ISSUE. THEY WERE POLITE BUT DECLINED ANY HELP. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE CAR HAS AN ONBOARD COMPUTER THAT DISPLAYS AN ERROR IF THERE IS AN ISSUE. I TOLD THEM THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE FATAL ACCIDENTS ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE ANY POWER AND IT IS NOT FIT TO BE DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY BUT HONDA USA SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY SUCH ISSUE. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND EVEN TRIED TO CORRECT IT VIA THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK AND THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO REPLACE THE BATTERY. *TR",

NO PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED, BUT IDLE HAS BEEN \"RELEARNED\", AND OTHER SOFTWARE ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN REINSTALLED.  SO FAR, TECHNICIANS HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED CAUSE OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION.

CAR WAS RACING FOR ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS BEFORE TURNED OFF.  WHEN TURNED BACK ON WITH CAR IN PARK, THE ENGINE STILL RACED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS THEN CAME BACK TO NORMAL IDLE AND DRIVER WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO DESTINATION WITH NO FURTHER PROBLEM.  CAR WAS TAKEN THE NEXT MORNING TO DEALERSHIP AND KEPT FOR TWO WEEKS WHILE TECHNICIANS TESTED IT, DROVE IT OVER 500 MILES, HAD FACTORY TECHNICIANS COME, AND PERFORMED UPDATES AND REINSTALLATIONS LISTED ABOVE.  THE CAR WAS DECLARED SAFE AND RUNNING ACCORDING TO HONDA SPECS, SO OWNER TOOK BACK THE CAR.  WEEK LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN. 2ND TIME, DRIVER WAS ABLE TO PUT CAR IN NEUTRAL, AT WHICH POINT RPMS ROSE TO OVER 5000, THEN DROPPED BACK TO NORMAL IDLE.

WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA, I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE THE TIRES PREMATURELY 2 TIMES SINCE OWNING THE CAR DUE TO THE IRREGULAR WEAR ON THE TIRES.  HONDA DID NOT NOTIFY ME OF THE PROBLEM, REFUSED TO PAY FOR NEW TIRES BUT FINALLY ADMITTED AFTER THE SECOND PAIR OF TIRES WERE RUBBED BALD, THAT THE TIRE ARM OF THE CAR WAS CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TIRES.  THEY REPAIRED THE TIRE ARM, BUT WOULD NOT PAY FOR NEW TIRES.  THE TRANSMISSION OF THE CAR IS ALSO FLAWED IN DESIGN.  OCCASIONALLY WHEN ACCELERATING, THE GAS PEDAL OF THE CAR CAN BE PUSHED TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR WILL NOT CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE AND WILL LOOSE POWER.  THIS HAS HAPPENED AT STOP LIGHTS, ENTERING THE FREEWAY, AND GOING UP HILLS ENDANGERING MY LIFE AND THE LIVES OF MY PASSENGERS.  HONDA AGAIN, DID NOT NOTIFY ME OF THE PROBLEM, BUT TOLD ME WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN AFTER EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEMS THAT I NEEDED AN UPGRADE TO MY COMPUTER AND THAT THOSE UPGRADES MAY FIX THE PROBLEM. THOSE UPDATES TO THE COMPUTERS EFFECT THE BATTERY OF THE HYBRID PART OF THE CAR'S ENGINE. THOSE BATTERIES ARE LOOSING THE ABILITY TO HOLD A CHARGE  AND CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL BECAUSE THE CAR RELIES ON THAT BATTERY POWER TO RUN THE ENGINE.  THE GAS MILEAGE  OF THE CAR HAS ALSO BEEN STEADILY DECLINING.  WHEN THE CAR WAS NEW, IT GOT 45 MPG AND HONDA ADVERTISED IT GET 50 MPG, THE CAR NOW GETS AROUND 33 MPG.  THE COMPUTER UPDATES ARE CHANGING THE WAY THE CAR RUNS OFF OF GAS AND BATTERY POWER AND HONDA IS NOT REPLACING THE FAULTY BATTERIES.  THIS HAS ENDANGERED MY LIFE AND THE LIVES OF MY PASSENGERS BECAUSE THE FAULTY BATTERIES EFFECT HOW THE CAR OPERATES. *TR",

THE ENGINE REVVED TO 3000 - 3500 RPM BUT HAD NO POWER. WHEN STARTING FROM THE DEAD STOP THE CAR COULD NOT HOLD IT'S POSITION ON THE HILL. THE DEALER COULD NOT FIGURE OUT THE CAUSE BUT THEY APPLIED TWO SOFTWARE UPDATES TO THE COMPUTER THAT MIGHT HELP. THEY ALSO CONTACTED THE HONDA TECHLINE. HONDA TOLD MY DEALER THAT GIVEN THE AGE OF THE BATTERY (3 YEARS) AND WHEN THE TEMPERATURE REACHES 100 DEGREES (THERE WAS A COINCIDENTAL HEAT WAVE IN THE EAST) THIS WAS NORMAL OPERATION. ON THE SPECIFIC DAY THIS PROBLEM STARTED TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE EIGHTIES. THE DEALER SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND A THIRD WEEK ARGUING WITH HONDA THAT THE CAR DID NOT RUN RIGHT.    AT THIS POINT I CONTACTED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY OPENED AN 'INVESTIGATION'. THEY TOOK MY STATEMENT AND CONTACTED THE DEALER. THEIR CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE CAR IS OPERATING PERFECTLY NORMALLY. THIS TIME THEY SAID THAT GIVEN THE AGE OF THE BATTERY, IF YOU USE THE IMA TOO MUCH THE IMA BATTERY MAY OVERHEAT AND SHUT DOWN. THAT IS HONDA'S OFFICIAL POSITION AND THEY REFUSE TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.    THE SAFETY CONCERNS OF THIS PROBLEM ARE OBVIOUS.

THE ISSUE I AM HAVING HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A YEAR WITH NO SUPPORT TO FIX THE ISSUE FROM HONDA.  THE CHARGE IN MY IMA BATTERIES IS ALWAYS 0-2 BARS (I HAVE PHOTOS SHOWING THIS) WHICH CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO HAVE VERY LIMITED ACCELERATION.  ADD THE A/C BEING ON NOW IN THE SUMMER AND THE CAR IS BASICALLY USELESS.  ALSO, WHEN THE SYSTEM (VEHICLE COMPUTER) SEES THAT THE IMA BATTERIES ARE LOW OR EMPTY IT FORCES THE ENGINE TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED ,WHICH IS NOT A 'NORMAL' OPERATION.  WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES INTO A 'FORCED' RECHARGE IT COMMANDS THE ENGINE TO GO TO A HIGHER RPM TO CHARGE THE BATTERIES WHEN YOU ARE STOPPED THIS IN TURN CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO JUMP OR LURCH FORWARD WHEN YOU RELEASE THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS ALSO CONCERNS ME SINCE YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU AND ESPECIALLY LEAVE SPACE IF YOU ARE BEHIND A PEDESTRIAN CROSSWALK.  I HAVE CONTACT ALL THE HONDA DEALERS IN THE EAST VALLEY AND THEY TELL ME THE SAME STORY.

IT WAS PURCHASED AS IS SO I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO VOYLES HONDA IN MARIETTA, GA FOR A TOTAL CHECK-UP.  THE CAR WAS SERVICED AND GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT.  IT HAD 74,960 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME.    ON MARCH 8, 2010, ON MY WAY BACK HOME FROM JACKSONVILLE, FL THE CAR STARTED TO DECELERATE QUICKLY.  I WAS ON I95 NORTHBOUND WITH MY SON, AND IT WAS A VERY SCARY FEW MOMENTS FOR US.  WE MANAGED TO PARK THE CAR ON THE EMERGENCY LANE.  THE CAR WOULD NOT COME BACK ON.  WHEN WE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD, THERE WAS NO SMOKE BUT THERE WAS A FUNNY SMELL.  MY SON TOOK THE DIPSTICK OUT OF THE ENGINE AND IT WAS MELTED!  WE HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO YULEE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO SAID THE ENGINE WAS GONE.  AFTER STAYING IN A LOCAL HOTEL FOR THE NIGHT, MY HUSBAND PICKED US UP ON MARCH 9.  WHEN I GOT HOME I MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO GRAINGER HONDA IN SAVANNAH.      GRAINGER GETS THE CAR IN AND AFTER A $92.00 CHARGE FOR LOOKING AT IT, TELLS ME THAT THE ENGINE IS GONE AND THEY CAN GET ME A GREAT DEAL FOR $4,600.00 (A USED ENGINE WITH 19,000 MILES ON IT).   WELL IN THE MEAN TIME, MY SON HAD BEEN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM ON LINE AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY 2006-2007 HONDA CIVIC OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  HE FOUND HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 08-044 WHICH STATES THERE IS A MECHANICAL DEFECT IN SOME OF THESE ENGINES.  THE BULLETIN ALSO STATES THAT CUSTOMERS THAT ARE OUT OF WARRANTY WHEN THIS HAPPENS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR GOODWILL CONSIDERATION.    I EXPLAINED SEVERAL EMPLOYEES OF GRAINGER HONDA BUT THEIR RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO 'TAKE DOWN' THE ENGINE AT A TUNE OF ABOUT $500-$600.  HE SAID THEY MIGHT BE WILLING TO PICK UP 25% OF THE COST.   I TOLD HIM ABSOLUTELY NOT.  I TOLD HIM THIS WAS A DEFECT THAT HONDA WAS VERY MUCH AWARE OF AND THAT HONDA SHOULD PAY FOR THE ENTIRE REPAIR.  I ALSO CONTACTED HONDA OF AMERICA AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD DO NOTHING. *TR",

I PAID THE FIRST ACCIDENT WITH MY OWN FUNDS TO AVOID MY INSURANCE FROM RAISING.  THE SECOND ONE WAS PAID BY MY INSURANCE AS THE DAMAGE WAS MORE EXTENSIVE.    I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO 3 DIFFERENT DEALERS TO SEE WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE BRAKES AS THEY CONTINUE TO FAIL, BUT THEY CANNOT DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS UNLESS THEY CAN RECREATE IT.  ONE DEALERSHIP PUT ON NEW BREAK PADS, A NEW ABS MOTOR/SWITCH, AND DRAINED THE BRAKE FLUID.  I AM SURE THE OLD PARTS WERE EITHER DESTROYED OR SENT BACK TO HONDA, BUT I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE AVAILABLE.  THE PROBLEM STILL OCCURS WHEN IT IS VERY COLD AND DRIVING THROUGH PUDDLES OF WATER.  THE LAST OCCURENCE I HAD TO DRIVE INTO A CURB TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN AS THE BRAKES FAILED TO ENGAGE.  I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS TRIED TO GET HONDA TO RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE, BUT THEY WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL.  HONDA CONTINUES TO INSIST I AM AT FAULT EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL FOR BRAKES.  WHEN I USE THE BRAKES DURING THE COLD WEATHER WITH EXTREME MOISTURE, THEY GRIND LIKE A DRILL IN CEMENT OR METAL.  THE NOISE COMES FROM THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL.  IT IS NOT THE ABS BRAKES MAKING AS THE NOISE IS MORE FLUTERING  THAT OCCURS ACROSS THE WHOLE FRONT-END AND THE CAR STOPS WHEN YOU SLAM ON THE BRAKES. THE LAST DEALER SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOOK ME ON A TEST DRIVE DURING SNOWY WEATHER, BUT IT DID NOT OCCUR.  AGAIN, HE TOLD ME UNLESS THEY CAN RECREATE IT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO FIX IT.  I'VE NOTED THE APPROXIMATE INCIDENT DATE WAS IN JANUARY, BUT 2ND ACCIDENT OCCURED IN FEBRUARY OF 2008.  I GUESS I MUST GET KILLED BEFORE ANY DEALERSHIP OR HONDA TAKES ME SERIOUSLY AS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANY MORE. THEY SEEM TO DISCOUNT THE SERIOUSNESS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SEE ANY LEAKAGE WHEN THE EXAMINE THE BRAKES SO CONSEQUENTLY IT IS MY FAULT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. HELP!! *TR",

I CALLED ROUSH HONDA IN WESTERVILLE, OHIO AND BROUGHT IT IN THAT AFTERNOON.  I HAD TO RUN ON BACK ROADS INSTEAD OF THE FREEWAY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE IT - I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HAD IT TOWED.

I HAD AN OVERALL WARRANTY BUT I AM ABOUT 900 TO 1,000 MILES PAST.  IT WILL COST $500.00 PLUS TO FIX.  I GOT ON THE INTERNET AND THEN ON YOUR SITE AND I FIND A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN # 08=039 (NHTSA # 10026791) ON BOLTS COMING LOOSE ON WATER PUMP PULLEYS AND DOING DAMAGE.

IN FACT,  HONDA HAD ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN (008-001) FOR THIS BACK IN EARLY  '08. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR CONTROL ARMS WHICH CAN CAUSE  UNEVEN OR PREMATURE TIRE WEAR IN ALL 2006-2007 CIVICS, EXCEPT FOR THE  SI. SO I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER, SHOWED THE ADVISOR THE SERVICE  BULLETIN, AND GOT THE CONTROL ARMS FIXED.    NOW WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST FIX THE CONTROL ARMS IN THE FIRST PLACE  INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING THE CUSTOMER'S DRIVING HABITS? SEEMS TO ME  EITHER THE ADVISOR IS INCOMPETENT OR DISHONEST.

I PURCHASED NEW TIRES THE FOLLOWING MONDAY FROM A LOCAL TIRE STORE. DURING MY ONLINE SEARCH FOR NEW TIRES I FOUND OUT THAT OTHER CIVIC CAR OWNERS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS DUE TO A REAR SUSPENSION FAULT WITH HONDA CIVICS. I THEN MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH AUTOFAIR TO HAVE THEM CHECK THIS ISSUE ON JULY 13. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEN INFORMED ME THAT THEIR WAS AN ISSUE AND NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED. BECAUSE MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED, I HAD TO PAY AUTOFAIR TO FIX THIS ISSUE. THEY PUT IN THE FOLLOWING PART: 1 04523-SNA-A01 SET, UPPER ARM RR.

THE IMA BATTERY THAT POWERS THE ASSIST MOTOR HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE AND HAS HAD DEGRADED PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST YEAR CAUSING THE CAR TO BE UNDERPOWERED AND UNSAFE TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE IMA SYSTEM ROUTINELY FULLY DISCHARGES (ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS IN ARIZONA) AND LEAVES THE CAR ONLY TO RUN ON THE UNDERPOWERED 1.3 L GAS ENGINE. THE CAR IS VERY SLUGGISH, CAUSING SAFETY ISSUES WHEN ACCELERATION IS NEEDED IN CITY OR INTERSTATE DRIVING. MY WIFE DRIVES 3 KIDS TO SCHOOL (35 MILES ON WAY) ON A DAILY BASIS AND IS CONCERNED FOR THE KIDS AND HER SAFETY ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE BATTERIES ALSO ARE LOCATED UNDER THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT.  DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE HEAT THE REAR PASSENGERS (MY KIDS) ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING THAT THE SEAT IS WARM AND THAT IS EXCESSIVELY HOT IN THE BACK SEAT   SINCE THE PROBLEM FIRST WAS OBSERVED IN LAST SUMMER 2008, I HAVE TAKEN IT TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT HONDA DEALERSHIPS. THEY ALL STATE THAT THIS IS 'NORMAL' OPERATION AND UNLESS THE SERVICE LIGHT COMES ON THAT NOTHING IS WRONG.  THE SERVICE LIGHT THEY ARE REFERRING TO IS THE P1433 BATTERY DEGRADED CODE THAT STATES TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES.  IT SEEMS ODD THAT THEY WAIT UNTIL THE BATTERIES ARE TOTALLY FAILED AND DEPLETED BEFORE THEY WILL CHANGE THEM.  I NOTICED THAT HONDA DOES HAVE A TSB OUT COVERING EXCESSIVE HEAT AND THAT IT CAN SEVERELY DAMAGE THE IMA BATTERIES.  THIS STATES THAT IF THE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 150 DEGREES F THAT THE BATTERIES CAN BE DAMAGED OR FAIL.  I KNOW THAT HEAT SOAKING THE CAR FOR 8-10 HOURS IN THE FULL SUN AT 110+ DEGREES (SHADE TEMP) CAN EASILY HEAT THE IMA BATTERIES TO VERY CLOSE TO 150 DEGREES.

I BOUGHT MY HONDA CIVIC USED AT AROUND 13K MILES. SINCE THEN, I'VE NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT EVERY MONTH. DESPITE THIS MY TIRES BECAME EXCESSIVELY WORN AT 27K.  I WENT TO TWO HONDA SERVICE STORES (MISSION VALLEY & PACIFIC HONDA IN SAN DIEGO) TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE NEED FOR ALIGNMENTS, ROAD NOISE, & TIRE WEAR. THEY KNOWINGLY WITHHELD INFORMATION & FAILED TO INFORM ME OF THE SERVICE BULLETIN 08-001 SINCE THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS (A WARRANTY ITEM) THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPLACE.  IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN, HONDA INFORMS THE DEALERS OF COMMON COMPLAINTS RELATED TO TIRE WEAR & SUSPENSION & ADVISES THEM TO REPLACE THE REAR CONTROL ARMS ON THE HONDA CIVIC. HONDA ALSO WILL REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS PRO-RATA FOR TIRE REPLACEMENT IF THEY HAVE LESS THAN 25K IN MILEAGE.  IF HADN'T HAVE DONE MY OWN RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS SERVICE BULLETIN. I TOOK MY CAR IN AROUND 26K SO THAT THEY COULD REPLACE MY REAR CONTROL ARMS. THEY DID THIS FOR FREE BUT SAID I DIDN'T QUALIFY TO GET MY TIRES REPLACED SINCE I WAS OVER THE 25K THRESHOLD. IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE BULLETIN, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY TIRES REPLACEMENT BY HONDA EARLIER.  IT WAS THEIR FAULTY PARTS THAT LED MY TIRES TO WEAR EXCESSIVELY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAD TO SHELL OUT $650 TO REPLACE MY TIRES AT AROUND 26K MILES. I'VE PROBABLY SPENT $500 DOLLARS IN ALIGNMENTS BECAUSE OF THE CONTROL ARMS TOO.  HONDA SHOULD OWN UP TO THE FAULTY PARTS ENTIRELY AND STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT.     SEE HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 08-001. *TR",

ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO THE CAR STARTED DRIVING FUNNY, AND THE REAR END WAS SLIGHTLY MOVING SIDE TO SIDE ON THE HIGHWAY. I CHECKED AND NOTICED THE TIRES WERE ALMOST GONE IN THE REAR. WITH ONLY 22000 MILES THE TIRES SHOULD NOT BE WEARING DOWN SO ALL OF THE WIRES ARE SHOWING IN THE TIRE. I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS CAUSING IT. I ALREADY KNEW THE ALIGNMENT WAS OFF, BUT I JUST FELT LIKE SOMETHING ELSE WAS WRONG. I CALLED MY DAD AND TOLD HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON. A COUPLE DAYS LATER HE FOUND A WHOLE BUNCH OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT 2006-2007 CIVICS, WITH EXCESSIVE WEARING OF THE BACK TIRES. IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. IT IS CAUSED BY BAD CONTROL ARMS IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT HONDA HAS MADE A BULLETIN OF THIS, BUT HAS NOT YET ISSUED A RECALL. I CALLED THE MANAGER TO WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR, AND TOLD HIM THAT MY TIRES WE WORE DOWN TO THE WIRES. ACCORDING TO HIM HE CONSIDERED THAT NORMAL WEAR. NOW THAT I KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM, I GOT IN CONTACT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO IS LOOKING AT MY CAR ON MONDAY. I HAVE PRINTED OFF ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS AND THE PICS OF THEIR TIRES SO I CAN SHOW HIM.

BUT WITH JUST OVER 15,000 MILES, DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS LIKELY. CONTACTED THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT DONE. THE DEALER CONFIRMED ALL FOUR TIRES BAD, INSIDE TIRE WEAR AND CUPPING. SUGGESTED I REPLACE THE TIRES WITH A NEW SET OF KUMHO BRAND TIRES, REPLACE THE REAR UPPER CONTROL ARMS AND DO A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT. TIRE TREADWEAR 6/32 AND 7/32.    SINCE I HAD NOT ROTATED THE TIRES, I FIGURED THE FRONT TREADWEAR WAS PARTIALLY MY FAULT, BUT HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE REAR TIRES BECAUSE I COULD NOT REMEMBER SUCH PROBLEMS IN PRIOR AUTOMOBILES I HAVE OWNED. WAS ALSO PUZZLED BY THE NEED TO REPLACE THE REAR UPPER CONTROL ARMS IN A CAR WITH 15,772 MILES. WOULD HAVE HAD THE WORK DONE THOUGH, AS WE WERE HEADED ON VACATION, BUT ESTIMATED WORK TIME WAS 3 HOURS. MECHANIC SAID NO SAFETY PROBLEMS AND I DECIDED TO CONTINUE ON TO TENNESSEE ON VACATION. BESIDES, WANTED TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAR TIRES AND CONTROL ARMS.    TONIGHT WAS RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON THE WWW. AND EASILY FOUND INDIVIDUAL STORIES FROM CIVIC OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. ONE WEB SITE HAD INFORMATION ABOUT HONDA FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING REAR SUSPENSION PROBLEMS AND CONTROL ARM REPLACEMENT TO SOLVE IT. IN SOME CASES THEY REIMBURSE FOR TIRE REPLACEMENTS.    WHAT CONCERNS ME THOUGH IS THAT IF THERE IS A REAR SUSPENSION PROBLEM AND THE CONTROL ARMS SOLVE IT, HOW LONG WILL THAT FIX THE PROBLEM. ARE THEY USING THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT, OR A BEEFED UP CONTROL ARM. IF SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE ARMS HASN'T BEEN DONE, THEN A NEW SET OF TIRES WILL ONLY START WEARING WITH THE FIRST MILES DRIVEN AND HONDA OWNERS WILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN 15 - 20, 000 MILES.  *TR",

RESEARCHING THE INTERNET, I LOCATED NUMEROUS HONDA CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS. I FOUND THAT HONDA HAS KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM SINCE 2006 AND NOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. NOR HAVE THEY NOTIFIED THEIR CUSTOMERS. HONDA RELEASED A TSB IN APRIL, 08 BUT STILL WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO MY CAR. THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL REPLACE THE SUSPENSION/CONTROL ARMS BUT WILL NOT REPLACE THE TIRES ON MY CAR. AT 24,000 MILES ON MY CAR AND A NEW CAR WARRANTY, I FEEL AS THOUGH I,  THE CONSUMER,  AM GETTING SCREWED IN THIS DEAL. THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE NOTIFIED AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  *TR",

SINCE IT IS A CVT, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT AVAILABLE, AND REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY. MY INCIDENT: I WAS DRIVING HOME, WHICH TAKES ME THROUGH ABOUT 33 MILES OF A WINDING HILLY ROAD. THERE WAS A SLOW DRIVER, HOLDING UP ABOUT 6-7 CARS, OF WHICH I WAS PLACED NEXT TO LAST (ONE BEHIND ME.) THERE IS A PASSING LANE THAT WAS APPROACHING, AND WHEN WE REACHED THE PASSING LANE, THE SLOW-POKE PULLED OUT TO LET US PASS. THE SLIPPING OF THIS TRANSMISSION WAS ALMOST A KILLER-AS WE (ALL OF THE TRAILING CARS) SPED UP TO PASS (ALL WITHIN APPROPRIATE SPEEDS, CLEARANCES, ETC). I HAD JUST STARTED TO ACCELERATE, WHEN THIS !@#$% SLIPPING BEGAN, AND I WATCHED AS THE TACH WENT TO ALMOST RED-LINE, BUT THE CAR DIDN'T GAIN ANY SPEED-IT STAYED AT ABOUT 35-36 MPH, WHICH WAS THE SPEED WE WERE GOING WHEN THE PASSING ATTEMPT STARTED.  THIS WAS ALLEGEDLY A PROBLEM IN EARLIER YEAR MODELS OF THE SAME VEHICLE, BUT I AM NOT SURE IF THE CAUSE WAS THE SAME. IN ANY CASE, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DEVELOPMENT, AND I WANT IT FIXED. MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY, AND I WILL DRIVE IT TO A HONDA DEALER IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO, BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY TROUBLE GETTING THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED. ALSO, SINCE THE FIRST NOTICED OCCURRENCE, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS IS OCCURRING ALMOST EVERY TIME I TRY TO ACCELERATE.

THERE WAS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CAR THAT WAS TEST DRIVEN AND THE CAR THAT WAS PURCHASED. THE DEALER ORIGINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE THROTTLE LAG BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. THEY CONTACTED HONDA CANADA AND WERE TOLD TO PROPERLY \"BREAK IN\" THE ENGINE. THIS CONSISTED OF LUGGING THE CAR IN FIFTH GEAR (MANUAL TRANSMISSION) UP A HILL FOR APPROX 100 KILOMETERS. THEY FELT THAT THE ENGINE WAS TIGHT AND THAT THIS MIGHT HELP THE THROTTLE LAG PROBLEM. IT DID, MARGINALLY. FURTHER CONTACT WITH HONDA CANADA WAS MET WITH A RESPONSE THAT THROTTLE LAG WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CAR AND THE DRIVE BY WIRE THROTTLE SYSTEM. APPARENTLY THROTTLE LAG IN DRIVE BY WIRE IS NOT UNCOMMON AND THERE ARE SOME AFTER MARKET PARTS (SPRINT BOOSTER) TO HELP THE PROBLEM BUT NOT FOR HONDA AND THEY ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE. THE DEALER SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS IT IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE BUT NO SOFTWARE FIX HAS BEEN AVAILABLE THROUGH HONDA CANADA. THERE IS MOST DEFINITELY A PROBLEM BETWEEN THE SENDING AND RECEIVING UNIT IN THE DRIVE BY WIRE SYSTEM. THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN SOME CIVICS THAN OTHERS. ALTHOUGH MINE IS PRONOUNCED, HONDA CANADA DOES NOT SEE IT AS A PROBLEM.

HONDA AMERICA AGREED TO PAY FOR THE LABOR TO REPAIR IT, BUT WANTED ME TO PAY FOR THE PARTS. ( ABOUT $300) THEY ALSO AGREED TO PAY FOR A RENTAL CAR FOR FOUR DAYS  WHILE MY CAR WAS BEING REPAIRED.  I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PARTS, SINCE I CONSIDER THE PROBLEM TO BE A FACTORY DEFECT.  THE CAR HAS A SIX SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  I KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A STANDARD, AND I'M CONVINCED THAT I DID NOTHING TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM.  *NM",
