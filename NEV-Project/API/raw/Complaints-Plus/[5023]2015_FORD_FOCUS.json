I immediately pulled off the highway and parked the car for 15 minutes.  The message cleared and I proceeded to drive about another 15 miles and the car lost power to the transmission while in traffic on the interstate. I had to make a lane change and pull off the road. Fortunately I was close to a vehicle repair facility so I drifted to the facility.  They immediately evaluated the problem and I was told the transmission had completely failed, which apparently is an issue that Ford was aware of during manufacture. This failure could have caused a crash because I had to switch lanes with perfect timing to prevent an accident. The repair facility contacted a Ford Technician about a mile away who came and tested/evaluated the transmission and confirmed that it had a total failure. From the first warning message until the complete failure was within a ten minute period after allowing the first warning message to clear from the 15 minute cooling period.  I am still waiting on parts and repair bills as of 02/09/2022. They will be forwarded as received. This will be the 3rd transmission installed on this vehicle.",

It is now at 88k miles and the clutch is shuddering again.  Ford reuses to fix the problem even though this is the third instance of this issue occuring. This shuddering makes merging unsafe as the vehicle hesitates and the car jerks back and forth. It extreme cases, it causes motion sickness to the passengers. Shuddering takes place up to third gear which does not help the driver concentrate and negotiate traffic if the car is shaking or jerking back and forth. There is a constant fear that the vehicle will just fail in the middle of traffic and we will be stranded. No illuminated lamps on the dash board to indicate a potential code. As stated before this vehicle has been brought to Ford twice already and the part they replaced keeps failing at roughly every 30k miles. We have tried to work with Ford to have them fix the problem but instead of replacing the faulty part they now want to charge us $2500 dollars. Why does the transmission seem to fail at every 30k miles? The dealership does not return our calls: we have called roughly 10 times and left messages. When calling Ford directly they state we have to bring it to the dealership, the same dealership which does not return our calls. Having a component in the transmission that makes it unsafe to drive is unacceptable. What makes it even more unacceptable is the fact that Ford has replaced this part 2 times already and it is failing again just 30k miles later, but now it somehow is not covered under the part warranty.",

My wife and I are retired on a fixed income and an unexpected $2,470 expense is devastating to us.  We bought this car hoping to keep it forever and save money along the way.

SO IN APRIL OF 2019 I TOOK MY CAR TO THE SHOP AT CARMEN FORD IN NEWCASTLE, DE WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR FROM. WHEN I TOOK IT THERE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FOR THE RECALL HAD CAME ON AND IT WAS JERKING. THEY CLAIM THEY FIXED IT. WELL IN THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER 2019 MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WITH THE SAME CODE AND WAS JERKING AGAIN. I TOOK IT BACK TO CARMEN FORD. THEY HAD MY CAR THREE WEEKS AND THEY SAID ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS RESET TWO THINGS THAT WEREN'T MATCHING UP. THE SAME DAY I PICKED IT UP I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK BECAUSE IT WAS STILL JERKING. THEY HAD MY CAR TWO IN A HALF MORE WEEKS THAN CALLED ME AND SAID THAT 4 TECHS DROVE MY CAR AND THEY HAD NO PROBLEM AND IT WASN'T JERKING. SO I WENT UP THERE AGAIN ON JANUARY 13,2020 AND DID A RIDE TEST WITH BILL WHO AT THIS TIME HAD NOTICED THE JERKING MY CAR WAS DOING THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. WE TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK TO CARMEN FORD WHERE HE SAID HE WILL LET THE TECHS NO IT'S JERKING NOW. TWO DAYS LATER HE CALLED ME AND SAID THE TECH DID A SHUTTER TEST AND IT'S NORMAL. HE SAID THAT SOMETIMES FORD CARS DO THE JERKING AND THAT IT IS NORMAL. I EXPLAINED TO THEM IT HAS ONLY DONE IT THESE TWO TIMES THAT MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WITH THIS RECALL THING. HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND MY CAR WAS READY FOR PICK UP. I PICKED UP MY CAR ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 15,2020. WHEN I PICKED IT UP IT WAS MAKING A LOUDER NOISE THAN HAD BEEN, STILL JERKING VERY BAD AND NOW WILL NOT REVERSE. I CALLED THE SERVICE SHOP AT CARMEN FORD SATURDAY MORNING JANUARY 16,2020@ 10:30AM AND THEY BASICALLY BLEW ME OFF. THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN THAN I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH IN THAT CAR AND I DON'T FEEL IT IS SAFE AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO FIX ANYTHING BUT KEEP TELLING ME IT'S FINE.

UNFORTUNATELY, THEY JUST WANT TO KEEP FIXING THOSE TRANSMISSIONS AND CONTROL MODULES BUT THE SITUATION IS VERY DANGEROUS. THE LOSS OF POWER HAS HAPPENED TO ME IN SOME DIFFERENT CONDITIONS; FROM GOING UP A HILL IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED, TO JUST DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. ON A FEW OCCASIONS, WHILE TRAVELING ON HIGHWAYS, MY CAR WAS UNABLE TO SHIFT INTO PASSING GEAR AND EVEN SEEMED TO LOSE POWER AT SPEEDS OF 55-65 MPH WHEN TRYING TO PASS OTHER VEHICLES. ON TWO SPECIFIC OCCASIONS, MY CAR WAS UNABLE TO GO INTO PASSING GEAR AS I TRIED TO PASS ANOTHER CAR.  HOWEVER, LAST WEEK AND ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO I LOST POWER WHILE I WENT TO PASS A VEHICLE ON A TWO LANE ROAD AND HAD TO DROP BACK BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT RESPOND AND ACTUALLY LOST POWER AT A MOMENT THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION IF THE CAR I WAS PASSING WOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN AT THE SAME TIME I LOST POWER AND THE ON COMING CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN. THIS HAS BEEN SCARY AND SURPRISES ME BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. THEY SAID IT IS HAPPENING TO MANY OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES AS WELL. I WOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS SOONER IF I HAD KNOWN THIS NHTSA SITE WAS AVAILABLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO JUST KEEP PUTTING OUT UNSAFE VEHICLES AND CONTINUE REPAIRING THEM WHEN SUCH A DANGEROUS CONDITION RISKS THE LIVES OF ANYONE WHO PASSES ANOTHER VEHICLE ON A TWO-LANE HIGHWAY.

I WENT TO PICK IT UP AND HE SAID IT STILL MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A SHUDDER AND THAT IT WAS NORMAL AND THAT IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE MY CAR. HE ONLY LISTED THAT I COMPLAINED OF A SHUDDER ON THE WORK ORDER, NEVER PUT DOWN THAT ANY REPAIR PARTS WERE ORDERED OR ON BACK ORDER, AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE THERE WAS ONLY AN INSPECTION ALONG WITH AN OIL CHANGE. I DROVE MY SHUDDERING CAR HOME, PERTURBED AT THEY'RE INADEQUACY. I RECEIVED AN E-SURVEY FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND I GAVE THEM THE POOR GRADE THAT WAS WARRANTED.

ANOTHER SERVICE REP DROVE IT BUT SAID HE DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING JUST THE NORMAL JERKING. I KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN A MANUAL CAR AND THE FORD FOCUS ISN'T IT.

I TOLD THE SERVICE DEPT. ABOUT IT, BUT THEY SAID WITH JULY THEY WERE SHORT OF HELP WITH VACATIONS, AND SINCE THE CAR ONLY HAD 500 MILES ON IT, I HAD \"PLENTY OF TIME\" ON THE WARRANTY, NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT.  THEY SAID TO LET IT BREAK IN AT LEAST ANOTHER 500 MILES.  SO FAR I'VE NOT HAD SMOKE, STARTING OR STALLING PROBLEMS LIKE OTHERS HAVE REPORTED.  I HAVE BROKEN IN LOTS OF BRAND NEW CARS IN MY LIFETIME, AND NEVER, EVER HAD A BURNING SMELL.

HE PICKED UP THE CAR AND THE TRANSMISSION STILL MADE THE SAME WHINING SOUND. A FEW WEEKS WENT BY AND THE NOISE WAS LOUDER SO DAD CALLED AGAIN.

HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS \"DRIVEABILITY CONCERNS\" WITH THE TRANSMISSION.   DAD, AGAIN, HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT AND THE DEALER REPLACED SOME OF THE PARTS IN THE TRANSMISSION.  STILL, THE CAR WHINED AND DAD TOOK IT BACK.  THE DEALER THEN TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD DRIVE IT 2500 MILES TO LET THE PARTS GET WORN IN. 2500 MILES LATER DAD TOOK IT BACK, NOISE GOT WORSE.  THE FORD REP CAME OUT AND TOLD DAD THAT THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS BUT THEY COULDN'T FIX ALL OF THEM.  REALLY??? THEY FIXED THE F-150, WHY NOT THE PASSENGER CARS?  I AM APAULLED AT THEWAY FORD HANDLES THIS SITUATION.  MY FATHERS LIFE MAY NOT MEAN ANYTHING TO FORD, BUT IT MEANS THE WORD TO ME.  FORD HAS PROVEN TO ME THAT THEY SEE A LIFE AS DISPOSABLE IN LIGHT OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE. WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IN ALL OF THE CARS, FORD OWNERS HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT, GO OUT, THEN WHAT?  WE AS CONSUMERS ARE STUCK WITH A HEFTY BILL FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
