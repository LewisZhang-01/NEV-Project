THE PROBLEM BEGAN ABOUT 7 DAYS AGO ON APRIL 19, 2010.   2) THE FAILURE IS IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET.

THE CAR IS HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME STARTING AS WELL AS GETTING POWER TO DRIVE. THE CAR STALLS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WILL START. THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR.  3) TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM, I WILL REPLACE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, WHICH IS IN THE AREA OF $600-1000.

WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP SIGN THE CAR STARTED JURKING AND THE ENGINE DIED. I STARTED THE CAR UP AGAIN AND KEPT ON DRIVING FOR ABOUT 1/2 A MILE (I DROVE FOR ABOUT 10 MILES PRIOR TO THIS CAR FAILURE AND THAN AFTER THE CAR WAS PARKED IDLE FOR ABOUT 5 HOURS I DROVE BACK HOME FOR 12 MILES WITH NO PROBLEMS). WHILE DRIVING TO SCHOOL A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER  FOR ABOUT 8 MILES I  SLOWED DOWN TO TAKE AN EXIT OF A HIGHWAY AND THE CAR STARTED JURKING AND THE ENGINE STALLED OUT AND DIED I RESTARTED THE CAR AND DROVE FOR ANOTHER 3 MILES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. THE CAR WAS THEN PARKED FOR  7 HOURS WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL AND I DROVE BACK HOME 12 MILES WITH NO PROBLEMS. MY BROTHER IN LAW DECIDED TO TAKE THE CAR TO WORK AND HE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM TWICE ON TWO SEPERATE DAYS IN ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE(8-10 MILES).    I DROVE THE CAR TO A MECHANIC BUT HE COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND WAS RELUCTENT IN TRYING TO FIND THE CAUSE TO THE PROBLEM. NEVERTHELESS, HE REPLACED THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP AND THE DISTRIBUTOR ROTOR. I KEPT THE CAR RUNNING IN MY PARKING LOT AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUED. THE CAR RAN FINE FOR 3 HOURS THEN THE ENGINE STARTED JURKING IN BETWEEN 2000RPM AND 3000RPM AND THE ENGINE DIED. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND IT RAN FOR ANOTHER 20MIN AND IT DIED AGAIN AND WOULD NOT RESTART FOR ANOTHER SEVERAL HOURS.  I DROVE TO DIFFERENT SHOPS BUT NO MECHANIC WANTED TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS HARD TO FIND. SOME MECHANICS MADE SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT MIGHT BE WRONG. SO I REPLACED THE FUEL FILTER THE FUEL PUMP AND THE ALTERNATOR AND I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.   IF YOU HAVE ANY REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM PLEASE LET ME KNOW.THANKS.

FINALLY THIS PAST WINTER THEY ADMITTED THAT THE SEAL HAD TO BE REPLACED IN THE ENGINE AGAIN.  AT THIS TIME I WAS INFORMED FROM THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE ORIGINAL REPAIR THEY PERFORMED WAS NO LONGER WARRANTEED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OVER $800.  TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED.
