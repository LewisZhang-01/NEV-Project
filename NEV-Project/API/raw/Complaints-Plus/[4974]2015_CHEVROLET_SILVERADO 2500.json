This is not the first time this has occurred.  The safety issue related to the computer immediately shutting down the truck for emission reasons?

GOOD MORNING MR. HUNT,  THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING TRANSPORT CANADA'S RECALLS DIVISION.  IN REVIEWING THE RECALL AND DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH GENERAL MOTORS CANADA, THEY HAVE CLARIFIED THAT RECALL N192220470 DOES INVOLVE 2015-2019 MODEL YEAR SILVERADO HD MODELS. IN REVIEWING THE PROVIDED VEHICLE INDENTIFICATION NUMBER, IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THIS VEHICLE NO LONGER RESIDES IN CANADA. REGISTRATION HISTORY SHOWS THAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY EXPORTED OUT OF THE COUNTRY PRIOR TO THIS RECALL BEING ISSUED. THIS IS THE REASONING WHY YOUR VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THIS RECALL. GM'S N192220470 RECALL (TRANSPORT CANADA RECALL #2019-325) WAS ISSUED IN JUNE 2019, AND ONLY APPLIES TO VEHICLES THAT ARE REGISTERED AND OPERATED IN CANADA. DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE AND FAILURE RATES, THIS RECALL IS EXCLUSIVE TO CANADA, AND WAS NOT ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, TO ADDRESS VEHICLES THAT ARE OPERATED AND REGISTERED IN SIMILAR CLIMATES, 'COLD STATES' IN THE UNITED STATES, GENERAL MOTORS USA ISSUED A VOLUNTARY REGION SPECIFIC CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM (N192265660). TO FIND OUT IF YOUR VEHICLE IS APPLICABLE TO THIS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CALL GENERAL MOTORS USA WITH YOUR VIN NUMBER. FURTHERMORE, IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A SIMILAR FAILURE, AND FEEL YOUR SAFETY IS AT RISK, WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONTACTING AND LOGGING A COMPLAINT WITH OUR UNITED STATES COUNTERPARTS,   SINCERELY,RECALLS DIVISION / MULTI-MODAL AND ROAD SAFETY PROGRAMS  TRANSPORT CANADA / GOVERNMENT OF CANADA",

THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY IF IT IS RAINING.  THE HEADLAMPS ON DIM DO NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE MORE THAN 100 YARDS IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  THERE IS NO LIGHT PROJECTED TO THE SIDE MAKING IT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHEN MAKING TURNS, ESPECIALLY LEFT HAND TURNS.  I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE TO CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT THEY COULD NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  I CONTACTED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE LIGHTS WERE PERFORMING AS DESIGNED.  I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER.  ALTHOUGH THEY OFFERED ME A $ 2000 DISCOUNT ON A NEW GM VEHICLE, I AM NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE DEPRECIATION TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE TO GET RID OF A PROBLEM THAT IS NOT MY FAULT.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS ON THE INTERNET OF THIS SAME LIGHTING ISSUE.  NOT ONLY IS THIS PROBLEM A HAZARD TO MYSELF AND FAMILY, BUT OTHERS ON THE HIGHWAY.

APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS LATER, I NOTICED RUST ON THE PAINTED FRAME OF THE TRUCK. I HAVE PURCHASED 5 CHEVROLET'S SINCE 2001 AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY RUST ISSUES. AS I BEGAN TO LOOK THROUGHOUT THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE TRUCK, I NOTICED RUST ON ALL EXPOSED METAL AS WELL AS ON THE PAINTED METAL. WHAT CONCERNED ME RIGHT A WAY WAS THE AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE DRIVE SHAFT AND ON THE TRANSMISSION? I CONTACTED MY SALE PERSON [XXX] AND EXPLAINED WHAT I HAD FOUND. HE ADVISED ME THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND ASKED ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2015, I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR ITS FIRST MAINTENANCE. SERVICE EMPLOYEE [XXX] HANDLED THE SERVICE. I EXPLAINED TO HIM ABOUT THE RUST UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE. HE LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK AND STATED \"THAT'S EXCESSIVE. LET ME GET A MANAGER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.\"[XXX] LEFT AND RETURNED WITH [XXX], SERVICE MANAGER. BEFORE CHUCK EVEN LOOKED UNDER THE VEHICLE, HE EXPLAINED THAT RUST WAS VERY NORMAL. I EXPLAINED TO CHUCK THAT I HAD OWNED MULTIPLE CHEVROLET'S AND NONE HAD RUST ON THEM. I EXPLAINED MY CONCERN THAT RUST TAKES DOWN THE VALUE OF A VEHICLE GREATLY AND IN CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T HAVE WEATHER ASSOCIATED WITH RUST, ESPECIALLY ON BRAND NEW CARS.          IT EVIDENT THAT SELMAN CHEVROLET ONLY CONCERN IS TO SELL VEHICLES AND NOT ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY AN ISSUE WITH ONE OF THEIR VEHICLES THEY SOLD. AS FOR A SOLUTION REGARDING THIS, THEY COULD HAVE OFFERED TO UNDERCOAT THE VEHICLE, PAY TO HAVE IT DONE OR REPLACE IT.

UPON MOVING THE FLOOR MAT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, I NOTICE THE CARPET WAS SOAKING WET.  THERE IS A LEAK SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FIREWALL ALLOWING WATER TO ENTER THE CABIN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  LONG TERM, I AM AFRAID OF MOLD AND MILDEW ACCUMULATION AS WELL AS WATER AFFECTING ELECTRONICS.    FRONT DRIVERS SEAT HAS A LOT OF SLOP IN IT.  UPON ACCELERATING AND BRAKING, I CAN FEEL THE FRONT DRIVERS SEAT ROCK FORWARD AND BACKWARD SLIGHTLY.  SEAT MAKES A CLUNKING/TAPPING NOISE.    RADIO RECEPTION IS TERRIBLE.  FM RADIO LOOSES SIGNAL STRENGTH AND SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN A CAVE.  *TR",
