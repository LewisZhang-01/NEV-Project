In the course of this damage, I now need several thousand dollars worth of repairs that are directly attributed to this bolt failure.  The rest of the owners that have experienced this issue have had the same outcome. I am having my vehicle towed to a shop in a few days to get an estimate on the damages.

THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL, FOR POSITIVE CRANKCASE VENTILATION(PCV) VALVE HEATER, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN OR METHOD OF FIXING THIS. SINCE IT CAN LEAD TO A FIRE, IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED, BUT THE DEALERSHIP HAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT EVEN HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE WEBSITE AND LETTER TELLS YOU TO CALL THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP BUT THEY TELL YOU TO CONTACT BMW NORTH AMERICA, HOWEVER THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE. THE SERVICE SUPERVISOR AT THE LOCAL BMW DEALER SHIP IN GLENDALE CA  HAS NOT RETURNED MY MESSAGES AND THE NUMBER THEY REFER ME TO, BMW NORTH AMERICA AT 800.831.1117 JUST KEEPS RINGING...NO ANSWER. I DON'T FEEL SAFE INHALING THE PLASTIC FUMES AND IT COULD LEAD TO MY CAR CATCHING ON FIRE. BMW NEEDS TOANSWER QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE RATHER THAN REFERRING ME TO ADVERTISEMENTS TO PURCHASE A NEW BMW. (THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS ON THEIR \"RECALL\" WEBSITE). I WOULD LIKE THEM TO PROVIDE A CAR AND KEEP MY CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP UNTIL THEY FIGURE THIS OUT. I THINK THEY WOULD FIND A SOLUTION VERY QUICKLY IF THEY HAD TO PROVIDE ALTERNATOR TRANSPORTATION.

THE PROBLEM IS GALVANIZED CORROSION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT METALS OVER TIME. THE BOLTS ARE ALUMINUM, AND THE ENGINE MOUNTS ARE MAGNESIUM-ALUMINUM MIX.  I BELIEVE IT IS THE MAGNESIUM THAT IS CAUSING THE FAILURE.  THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FIXES. 1-EASY FIX WOULD BE TO TAKE STEEL BOLTS AND COAT THEM WITH ALUMINUM (THE ALUMINUM WILL SLOW CORROSION AND THE STEEL WILL STRENGTHEN THE BOLT WITHOUT GIVING WAY TO GALVANIZED CORROSION).  2-OTHER FIX WOULD BE TO MAKE THE BOLTS OF THE EXACT SAME MIXTURE AS THE ENGINE BLOCK (MAGNESIUM AND ALUMINUM) NOT JUST ALUMINUM. THE BOLTS STILL WONT BE AS STRONG AS THE STEEL (ALUMINUM) COATED BOLTS.",

I DISCOVERED THIS IS COMMON ON MANY BMW MODELS AND BMW IS AWARE OF IT SEE SIB 11-09-08.  I QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY OWNER OUT THERE WITH THIS PROBLEM. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS. BMW KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS NOT RECALLED ANY CARS. THERE DOCUMENTATION OF THE PROBLEM IS UNDER SIB 11-09-08.

ALL LEVELS SAY THEY WILL HELP BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS SHORT OF A TRANSMISSION REPROGRAMMING WHICH DOESN'T ELIMINATE  THE PROBLEM...AND THEY KNOW IT.  BMW STATES THE \"VEHICLE IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED\".  WHAT A STUNNING ADMISSION!  THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND QUITE EASY TO VERIFY.  SERVICE MANAGERS ADMIT THE PROBLEM TOO...AND BMW IS SAYING THEY DESIGNED THE VEHICLE THIS WAY???  WHO HAS TO DIE IN AN   ACCIDENT BEFORE THIS IS TAKEN CARE OF?  BMW HAD A REGIONAL TECH ENGINEER EVALUATE MY VEHICLE.  HE SAYS IT'S \"OPERATING AS DESIGNED\".  HE ALSO SAID THERE ARE NO 'FAULTS'.  A SERVICE MGR ONCE TOLD ME THAT 'FAULTS' DON'T ALWAYS REGISTER   IN THE COMPUTER SO HAVING 'NO FAULTS' ISN'T UNUSUAL.  BY THE WAY, BMW HAD ME TAKE THE CAR IN TO GET REPROGRAMMED SHORTLY \"BEFORE\" THAT REGIONAL TECH DID HIS EVALUATION.  YES, THEY REPROGRAMMED IT \"THEN\" SENT HIM IN!  NOTHING WAS FOUND?  GO FIGURE!  WHAT COULD I DO?  IT'S A LEASED VEHICLE.  I COULDN'T JUST SELL IT OR TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  WHY DO THEY REFUSE TO HELP ME WHEN IT WOULD COST NEXT TO NOTHING.  THEY LOVE MY $$$. *TR",

I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE MANY CARS WITHIN A CERTAIN LOT OF VIN NUMBERS , WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND MY VIN NUMBER FALLS WITHIN THIS LOT. I WAS ALSO TOLD AT THIS TIME, BMW HAS BEEN NOTIFIED, BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS, THE CAR HESITATES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND THEN SURGES FORWARD. THIS IS A PERIODIC OCCURANCE. IT APPEARS THAT THE ENGINE GETS THE FUEL BUT THEN DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. BMW SERVICE SAID THEY WOULD KEEP IN CONTACT WITH ME ABOUT FIXING THIS PROBLEM BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM IN OVER ONE MONTH. I LEFT ANOTHER MESSAGE LAST WEEK AND HAVE NOT HAD A RETURN CALL. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ISSUE? THANK YOU.*AK",
