        "summary": "Tailgate opens unexpectedly while vehicle is in motion. This has happened repeatedly over the past 12 months. After confirming that the tailgate was not inadvertently left open or opened while the vehicle was moving, we realized that the problem was internal. We could not find a cause of the problem with the tailgate opening. It caused damage to the tailgate and the towed fifth wheel. Cargo items stored in the truck bed (under the tonneau cover) have fallen out onto the road when the tailgate opens unexpectedly. This could have caused a major accident or death. I believe this truck has an electric tailgate latch release switch in the tailgate handle and I'm not sure whether this is a possible cause.  We took the truck to the Ford dealer who advised that the tailgate was not covered by any recall or warranty other than the extended warranty we purchased, for which we had to pay a deductible. The Ford dealer is also denying any responsibility for damage to the tailgate itself, damage to the fifth wheel, or damage from and loss of loose cargo falling out. We paid for the fix to the defective tailgate mechanism but feel strongly that this should be recalled due to the high risk of death or injury when the tailgate opens unexpectedly. Below date is only the most recent occurrence; as stated above, this has occurred multiple times including approximately June 12, 2021, April 20, 2021, September 24, 2020, September 30, 2020, August 9, 2020, and November 24, 2019.",
