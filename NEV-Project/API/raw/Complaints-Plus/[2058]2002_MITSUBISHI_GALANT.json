WELL IT FINALLY QUIT WORKING ALL TOGETHER AND AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH MITSUBISHI SEEMS TO BE PUTTING BAD HEAT CONTROL MOTORS IN THEIR CARS. MY CAR 2002 AND IT STARTED THIS IN 2004. AS MUCH AS I'VE PAID FOR THIS CAR THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS NOT A CHEAP PART TO HAVE FIXED AS I HAVE FOUND FROM MY RESEARCH. IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF I WAS THE ONLY ONE IT HAPPENED TO BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH MITSUBISHIS AND I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THEIR FAULTY PART. THANK YOU!  *TR",

MORE THAN 10,000 OF THESE 20,000 MILES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN WITH THE BRAKES SQUEALING OR CHATTERING.  EVENTUALLY THE BRAKING POWER FADES AND THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES TOO MUCH TO HOLD ONTO.  WHILE THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY, THE DEALER REFUSED TO DO ANY REPAIR COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  THE DEALER WOULD NOT INSPECT OR REPAIR THE CALIPERS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE TYPE OF SQUEALING INDICATED POOR CONTACT OF THE PADS WITH THE ROTORS DUE TO STICKING CALIPERS AND THE FACT THAT HEAT WARPAGE OF THE ROTORS INDICATES STICKING CALIPERS.  CALIPERS WERE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  INSTEAD, THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT I NEEDED TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR REAR BRAKE ADJUSTMENT AT THE SAME INTERVAL AS AN OIL CHANGE; HOWEVER, RESEARCH TELLS ME THAT THIS CAR HAS AUTO ADJUSTING REAR BRAKES!
