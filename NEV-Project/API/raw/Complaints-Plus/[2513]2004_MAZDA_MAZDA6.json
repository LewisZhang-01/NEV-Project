THE MILES/SPEED I LISTED ARE ACTUALLY N/A - THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED FOR MOST OF THE 10 YEARS I'VE OWNED THIS CAR. I COMPLAINED ABOUT SMELLING BURNING OIL COMING INTO THE CAR'S CABIN SINCE THE CAR WAS ONLY 1 YEAR OLD, BUT THE MAZDA REPAIR TECHS APPEARED TO \"NEVER NOTICE THE SMELL\". IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR OR SO AFTER MY WARRANTY ENDED - DESPITE A DOZEN INSTANCES OF COMPLAINING TO MAZDA DEALERS OF THIS SMELL - THAT I REALIZED MY PROBLEM WAS OIL LEAKING FROM MY V6 MOTOR'S TIMING CHAIN COVER. THE OIL LEAKS DOWN THE SIDE & BOTTOM OF THE MOTOR & DRIPS (ONLY WHILE DRIVING, NEVER WHILE RESTING) ONTO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM'S CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE CONVERTER VAPORIZES THE OIL, THE RESULT OF WHICH ENTERS THE CAR'S CABIN THROUGH THE HVAC SYSTEM. I HAVE BEEN ADDING A QUART OF OIL ALMOST EVERY TWO MONTHS FOR YEARS NOW, BREATHING THIS CARCINOGENIC VAPOR AND WORRYING ABOUT AN ENGINE FIRE FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE NOW. LEADING UP TO DISCOVERING THE LEAK, I HAD REPLACED MY VALVE COVER GASKETS & OIL PAN & GASKETS AT GREAT COST. THE PROPER REPAIR FOR THIS WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE REMOVING MY CAR'S ENGINE & A 12 HOUR REPAIR AT $100 PER HOUR, AND THAT'S JUST THE LABOR. WHEN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, IT APPEARS IN ONLINE FORUMS TO BE A CONSISTENT PROBLEM FOR HUNDREDS (LIKELY THOUSANDS) OF OWNERS, AND VARIATIONS OF THIS FORD-MADE V6 ENGINE ARE INSTALLED IN A DOZEN FORD AND MAZDA CARS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT OVER THE YEARS FORD - KNOWING THIS WAS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM - ADVISED IT'S DEALER NETWORK TO KEEP HUSH-HUSH AND PRETEND TO NOT UNDERSTAND OR NOTICE THE PROBLEM IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID A COSTLY RECALL CAMPAIGN. I FEEL THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR FORD, NOT MAZDA, TO PAY THE PIPER, AND I WOULD LIKE MY CAR REPAIRED WITHOUT A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP PLACED UPON ME.  *TR",

IT HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 10 MONTHS. TWO SEPERATE MAZDA DEALERSHIPS SAY THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND THEY \"CAN'T REPRODUCE THE SOUND.\" AT PINNACLE MAZDA (RENTON, WA), THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. I HAD A MECHANIC RIDE WITH ME TO TRY AND MAKE THE SOUND. DURING THE RIDE, HE STATED THAT MAZDA HAS BEEN HAVING A \"TON OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT BRAKES, ESPECIALLY THE RX-8, BUT ALSO ON THE MAZDA 6 AND MAZDA 3.\" HE FURTHER STATED, \"IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MAZDA CAN FIND A FIX EITHER.\" I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING COMING FROM A MAZDA MECHANIC.

THE FIRST DAY WE HAD THE CAR, WE HAD THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LOCK NOT OPEN USING THE KEY FOB OR THE KEY.  WE COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND THEN, SUDDENLY, IT STARTED WORKING AGAIN.  TWO DAYS LATER, THE FAILURE RE-OCCURED IN THE SAME WAY AND, AGAIN, WE WERE ABLE TO GET INTO THE CAR EVENTUALLY WITH REPEATED TRIAL.  THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART.  ON APR 21, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND STOPPED AT HER DESTINATION.  THE FAILURE OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LOCK OCCURED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME SHE WAS INSIDE THE CAR.  SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT OPEN THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR BY ANY MEANS AT ALL.  THE DOOR WAS NOT JAMMED, IT WAS JUST THAT THE DOOR WOULD NOT UNLOCK.  THE FOB WOULD NOT UNLOCK, THE MANUAL BUTTON WOULD NOT UNLOCK AND THE DOOR LEVER WOULD NOT UNLOCK.  SHE HAD TO CLIMB OVER THE CONSOLE (NO SMALL FEAT) AND GET OUT THROUGH THE PASSENGER DOOR.  I BELIEVE THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET OUT OF A CAR TO SAVE LIFE OR LIMB.

WHEN IN A PASSING SITUATION WITH THE THROTTLE FULLY OPEN, THE ENGINE JUMPS INTO ACTION AND THE TRANSMISSION DOWN SHIFTS AS IT SHOULD.  HOWEVER, IF THE GAS PEDAL IS KEPT PRESSED DOWN AS IN A PASSING SITUATION, THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT UP SHIFT AT ANY POINT.  THE RESULT IS THAT THE ENGINE RPMS WILL INCREASE TO THE POINT OF HITTING THE RED LINE.  AT THAT POINT ANOTHER FEATURE SHUTS DOWN THE ENGINE UNTIL THE RPMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE RED LINE.  THE RESULT IS LOSS OF POWER AT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME IN THE PASSING MANEUVER.  I WAS ABLE TO BRAKE AND RETURN TO THE PREVIOUS PLACE BEHIND THE VEHICLE BEING PASSED, BUT ALMOST DID NOT MAKE IT.  HAD I BEEN MUCH FURTHER FORWARD I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE COLLIDED WITH THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.    I HAVE CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE.  THEY TESTED IT, TALKED WITH APPROPRIATE MAZDA SERVICE CENTER EXPERTS AND REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO MALFUNTION - ALL SETTING WERE AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE.  I CORRESPONDED WITH NORTH AMERICAN MAZDA VIA EMAIL (ATTACHED) AND FORWARDED THAT EMAIL STRING TO YOUR TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE AT TIS@NHTSA.DOT.GOV.  MAZDA CONTINUES TO SAY THAT NIETHER DESIGN DEFECT OR MALFUNCTION EXISTS.  TO THEM IT IS AN OPERATOR PROBLEM.

IT SEEMS THE FRONT CRASH SENSORS ARE TIGHTENED TOO MUCH AND CRACK, THEN ONCE THEY GET WET THEY ARE TRIPPED AND DISABLE THE SYSTEM.

IN MY CASE A LOCAL DEALER (NOT THE PURCHASE DEALER) ARE TELLING ME THAT AN AFTER MARKET REMOTE START IS TOTALLY TO BLAME., AND WILL NOT DIAGNOSE THE CAR FURTHER UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS REMOVED.
