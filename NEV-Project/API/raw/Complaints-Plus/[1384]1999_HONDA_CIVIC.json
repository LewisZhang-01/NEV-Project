They went through the motions of doing the replacement and gave me paperwork indicating they had serviced the recall, but I believe you had lied to me and they are lying to me about the recall.  This VIN does not correspond to an airbag recall according to multiple other sources.  I recently inspected the passenger airbag it definitely not new.  That is what clued me to begin checking further.  I don't believe they replaced the driver airbag either.  In the mean time I had to take buses to and from the dealership, after work, at night, in the rain, in the middle of this Omicron Covid spike.  You an the dealer endangered my health and I want to know why and who is responsible.",

HONDA REPS  TELL ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHY MY CAR IS NOT IN THE RECALL. I HAVE THE SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS AS IN THE RECALL.     IN CANADA, THEY RECALLED AND REPAIRED EVERY SINGLE CAR IN THAT COUNTRY.

THE COST IS $ 153.00 FOR THE SWITCH AND 195.00 FOR LABOR.     I'M READY TO ELEVATE THIS COMPLAINT IF NECESSARY, NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, ETC IF YOU DIRECT ME TO DO THIS. I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE USA WHO OWN A HONDA CIVIC FOR THOSE YEARS, HAVE A BAD SWITCH BUT, THEIR VIN # ISN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.

HE SAID THE CAR SUDDENLY PULLED STRONGLY TO THE LEFT AND HE ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  I REMEMBERED SEEING INFORMATION ON A VALVE STEM RECALL LAST SUMMER AND GAVE MY SON INFORMATION ABOUT THE DILL VALVE STEM RECALL.  THE VALVE STEMS WERE THE ONES MANUFACTURED AND RECALLED BY DILL, REF. ODI DEFECT INVESTIGATION EA08022.  THE TIRE SHOP DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE RECALL AND THE HONDA DEALER THAT INSTALLED THE TIRES 2 YEARS AGO ALSO PLEADED IGNORANCE.  AFTER FURTHER PERSISTENCE, MY SON WAS ABLE TO GET THE HONDA DEALER TO REPLACE ALL OF THE DEFECTIVE VALVE STEMS AND REPLACE THE TIRE THAT WAS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR.  HE IS STILL OUT $26 DUE TO THE FIRST VALVE STEM FAILURE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE TIRE SHOP IF THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE DILL VALVE STEM VOLUNTARY RECALL WAS BEING FOLLOWED.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE VOLUNTARY RECALL BY DILL IS INADEQUATE AND NOT ACCOMPLISHING ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.  ODI DEFECT INVESTIGATION EA08022 WAS PREMATURELY CLOSED. THE RECALL SHOULD BE MANDATED BY NHTSA AND BACKED UP BY THE LAW!  THE TIRE COMPANIES ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE DILL VOLUNTARY RECALL.
