The Kia dealership in Danville, VA reported no recalls (I've only had the car for 2 years). While driving to the dealership the car did the same thing. I had it towed to a certified mechanic. The mechanic said that it was the engine but he did not do engine work. My car is now sitting in my driveway, after being towed 4 times. I am making payments on a vehicle that I cannot drive. The safety issue is that there was no warning that the car is about to break down! I am driving on the highway with vehicles going 70 mph and the vehicle stops working properly. There are too many engine recalls for this year, make, and model and I find it disturbing that my VIN is not on the recall list.

I am the original owner and it has been kept in the garage most of the time. The paint peeling happened rapidly on the painted section between the Windshield and Sunroof. I Googled the issue and apparently it is widespread since 2011 on a lot of Kia and Hyundai models especially with Pear White paint. I took it to a Kia dealer who referred me to their paint contractor (Dent Magic) co-located with them. I spoke with the team and asked for an estimated. As soon as the estimator saw it he said \"Oh yes the is paint delamination, it was pretty wide spread on the vehicles a few years back. I am surprised yours took so long to peel. It was likely because you have garage kept it and it looks like you keep it in great condition. There was a manufacturing defect when they painted these cars and essentially the factory forgot to prime certain panels of the vehicles so the paint is not sticking properly. Unfortunately, Kia has not recalled this most likely because it is not a safety issue and the government has not forced them. However, if you leave it and it rusts it could cause lots of issues down the road.\" The gentleman then provided me with an estimate of $725.63. I then got 2 other estimates that were both over $1000. I ended up going with the Kia recommendation of Dent Magic for $725. I am hoping none of the other panels start to peel, I feel it is inevitable.",

Now my car is 8 yrs old and the original paint is starting to peel and the metal is showing, on the passenger side of the front windshield.  Now to me it seems that the original paint that was used for my car must have a defect. When, have you heard of the original paint peeling from the vehicle to where the metal is showing, that does not happened unless the paint is faulty   I have 2002 dodge caravan (White) and that has never happened, I also have a 2004 ford truck 150 (White) and that has never happened. As you can see how old these vehicles are and their original paint of the automobiles is still there.  Now I know it\u2019s the original paint, but if you need for me to take it to a Kia expert I will so they can analyze it.  I have had a lot of great compliments on my Kia Sorrento the people think is a brand-new car because the color looks well treated. When I tell them that it\u2019s a 2013 they complement me on how well the color is kept and what it is equipped with.   Now what am I going to tell them when they that ask me about my Kia, that the car is great but the paint they use is not of good quality, that after a couple of years it starts to peel down to the metal.   Now I could tell you my car\u2019s paint is not warned out or faded it still looks new. I have attached photos of my cars so you can see what I am talking about.",

They replaced the bulb and maybe the wires but I can't remember (I still have the paperwork from it if needed). The headlight worked for a short time and then would sporadically quit working here and there. Now, the wires look burnt which could cause a fire and the headlight will not work at all. I took it to Kia dealership and they said since I had it \"fixed\" through the dealership I got it from, it voided my warranty and I would have to pay to have the entire headlight assembly replaced. I looked online and it appears that there are over 300,000 complaints on this issue (including my sister in laws car which has the same issue). I don't believe I should be responsible for the fix as its been an issue this whole time. On top of this, the other headlight is now also working sporadically and I've been driving in the dark and had NO HEADLIGHTS when the other just stops working. This is a huge safety issue. Kia has told me that they will not do a goodwill fix. I've taken this to the escalation dept. but if they still refuse, my next move will be a lawyer. Kia needs to fix this issue. I wanted you to be aware. I've been pulled over several times because if this issue. Paying for tickets and bulbs (that don't fix the problem) is getting old. I hope you can document this and help in some way.  I've attached a photo of the wires now. The other photo is of the original bulb and wires that were replaced (and I paid for.

The service center personnel identified two tires on the passenger side having lower tire pressure and refilled air, which addressed the tpms sensor light. However, the following day while I was getting ready to take my daughter for a doctor visit, I noticed the abs, traction light and slope align assist sensors being on. While running an OBD2 scanner test on it, it turned out to be an issue with left rear wheel speed sensor. Though my car has gone past the warranty, I have not driven much as can be seen by the miles. Moreover, I also know a close member in my network purchasing a very similar car around the same time, but has driven a lot more miles. However, that car still has not shown any issue with the sensors. While digging further, I noticed that many others have seen a similar issue with these sensors, even after two or three years since the release, that were shared in Kia based forums. Being a safety concern, I would appreciate your department to look into this matter to see whether there is a manufacturing issue with these sensors.",

I asked if I should top it off with oil to prevent the engine from failing while we are driving, and they informed me not to do this \"as that will only prolong the issue.\" I then confirmed with them that the only solution being provided was to continue driving the car and wait until the engine fails while I am driving down the road, potentially with my family in the car which is an extremely dangerous situation. Multiple different Kia reps confirmed that is the only and \"best\" solution they can provide. The dealership said they see this issue with this engine \"all the time and it sucks\" but they cannot help me until I bring them a seized-up engine. They also said there is nothing they can do to fix the issue before the engine goes bad. They tried to provide a glimmer of hope by saying, \"the good news is there is a 99% chance you will get a new engine because we see major engine issues so often Kia just replaces the engine instead of having us tear it apart to diagnosis the issue because that takes less time and is cheaper.\" However, they confirmed again they will not and \"cannot\" fix the car until I bring them a seized engine and continue driving it until it fails.

Checking dipstick, no oil was registering.  We put 5 qts oil in car.  We then took the car to the dealership.  The dealership informed us to perform a factory certified oil change, do a diagnostic testing for 1000 miles, bring back to dealership for further evaluation.  we reluctantly did this test as we were concerned that the engine would lock up, catch fire, leave us stranded.

I HAD RESEARCHED THE MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH THE 2.4 LITER ENGINE ASSOCIATED WITH DEBRI IN THE ENGINE. I FEEL THIS FAILURE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT. I HAVE DONE MY MAINTENANCE ON MY VEHICLE SINCE I DROVE IT OFF THE LOT IN 8/2012. I HAVE ALL REPAIR AND RECALL RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH MY VEHICLE, I HAVE DONE ALL THE RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH MY SUV. I HAVE ALL RECEIPTS FOR OIL CHANGES, TRANSMISSION & FRONT AND REAR DIFFERENTIAL CHANGES. I HAVE USED BG-44 PRODUCTS TO KEEP MY ENGINE VALVES CLEAN AND CLEAR OF ANY DEPOSITS. I HAVE USED SUPER UNLEADED TO CLEAN THE FUEL SYSTEM, AT EVERY OIL CHANGE I PULL THE THROTTLE BODY OFF AND CLEAN IT THOROUGHLY. THERE IS NO WAY THAT EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS FAILURE WITH CYLINDER 4. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A BREAKDOWN IN WORKMANSHIP WITH THIS ENGINE. I AM HAVING MY MECHANIC TEAR IT APART AND CHECK TO SEE IF THE CYLINDER WALL IS SCORED FROM DEBRI AT THE TIME OF ASSEMBLY AND PUSH THIS BACK ON KIA FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ENGINE.

THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF OIL OR ANTIFREEZE IN THE ROAD.  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND PUSHED THE CAR OFF THE ROAD, WHILE MY HUSBAND STIRRED THE CAR BECAUSE WE LOST ALL STEERING FOR THE CAR.  WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO START IT, BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  WE ENDED UP HAVING IT TOWED TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP IN HICKORY, NC (PARAMOUNT KIA).  IT WAS ON A SATURDAY SO THEY WERE SHORT STAFFED, BUT WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE.  I WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS.  WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE V6 ENGINE HAD SEIZED AND IT NEEDED A STARTER AND A NEW BATTERY.  WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS GOING TO COST OVER $6,000.00 TO GET IT FIXED.   HOW COULD AN ENGINE WITH AROUND 114,000.00 MILES JUST STOP RUNNING AT A RED LIGHT WITH NO WARNING AND HOW DOES THE BATTERY AND STARTER ALSO GO OUT AT THE SAME TIME?  WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE THEY WERE GOING TO PUT IN THE CAR ALREADY HAD 88,000 MILES ON IT (I HAVE ATTACHED THE QUOTE AND DIAGNOSIS SHEET)I HAVE ALL OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS.  IT WAS GOING TO COST THIS MUCH AND THIS WAS NOT EVEN A NEW ENGINE AND WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS ENGINE WOULD LAST IF IT ALREADY HAS THIS MANY MILES ON IT?

I DID BRING MY CAR IN NOT LONG AGO AND THEY RE-FLASHED THE COMPUTER THAT CONTROLS THE TRANSMISSION, AND THIS NEW SOFTWARE MAY BE AT FAULT.  IT IS NON REPRODUCIBLE TO DEMO TO THE KIA MECHANIC. BUT CAN HAPPEN AS SAID ABOVE BUT NOT RELIABLY.  I PLAN TO GET A FULL ELECTRICAL DIAGNOSTIC OF THE MAIN COMPUTER, THE BODY CONTROLLER, AND TRANSMISSION CONTROLLERS TO SEE WHERE THE FAULT IS.  I QUESTION THE HEALTH OF THE MAIN COMPUTER AS NO CODES ARE RECORDED.....SAMPLING RATE SEEMS TO BE IN QUESTION.  THIS CAN HAPPEN AT 60 MPH OR 30 MPH, AT LOWER SPEEDS SEEMS LIKE THE ENGINE WILL TOTALLY QUITE ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE TIME, OTHER TIMES THE ENGINE CONTINUES TO RUN BUT IN \"LIMP MODE\" AND NON RESPONSIVE.  I SEE THIS AS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE, YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT WILL DIE.  IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS COMMANDED TO A LOWER GEAR AT HIGH SPEED AND AFTER THE JERKS, THE ENGINE WILL SHUT DOWN SO DAMAGE WILL NOT OCCUR TO TRANSMISSION OR ENGINE.  IF ENGINE DOES NOT SHUT DOWN FULLY, IT SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES ABOUT 5 SECONDS FOR THE COMPUTER(S) TO RESET AND RESUME \"NORMAL\" OPERATIONS.

DESPITE THIS LETTER, WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY KIA USA CORPORATE AND LITHIA KIA OF ANCHORAGE THAT OUR VEHICLE IS NO LONGER COVERED BY A WARRANTY DUE TO MILEAGE. I EXPECT SOMEONE IN A HIGHER LEVEL MANAGEMENT TO EXPLAIN, ASFORMERLY REQUESTED. AS OF DECEMBER 23, 2019, WE HAD OUR VEHICLE TOWED TO LITHIA KIA OF ANCHORAGE TO ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED, AND COMMUNICATE WITH KIA USA. KIA HAS DECIDED TO STOP COMMUNICATING WITH US AND WILL NOT SHARE ANY INFORMATION WITH OUR LAW FIRM, PER THEIR OWN GUIDANCE. WE ARE HOPING THIS WILL COMPLETE THIS TEDIOUS METHOD OF VEHICLE REPAIR(S). KIA NEEDS TO EXPLAIN TO US WHY IT WILL NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY AS STATED IN THE LETTER. I AM A RETIRED DISABLED VETERAN AND CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR. PER MY LAW FIRM'S INSTRUCTION(S), WE HAVE CONTACTED AND FILED A CLAIM THROUGH THE STATE OF ALASKA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS WELL.",

THE NEXT MORNING (THURS) I CALLED AND SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT KIA AND REPEATED THE NOISE AND ISSUES THAT BROUGHT MY CAR INTO THEM. HE CALLED ME BACK STATED HE LET THE CAR RUN FOR 1.5 HOURS, CHECKED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, AND ALL THE FLUIDS. THE CAR DIDN'T SPUTTER OR STALL OUT. ON FRI THEY RAN DIAGNOSTICS ON THE CAR.

HE ALSO MENTIONED AT THIS TIME THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL, AS A RESULT OF WATER GETTING INTO THE WHEEL BEARING CAUSING THIS PROBLEM TO OCCUR PRETTY CONSISTENTLY.  I CALLED MY LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP LOCATED AT 9009 W BROAD ST IN RICHMOND VA, AND SPOKE TO A SERVICE MANAGER. I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS AWARE THAT THERE HAD YET TO BE A RECALL ON ANY VEHICLES BUT THAT NUMEROUS BLOGS, AND FORUMS TOUTING THIS EXACT PROBLEM IN ADDITION TO THE SERVICE BULLETIN SEEMED TO INDICATE THIS WAS A DESIGN FLAW IN THEIR VEHICLES.I WAS TOLD HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THAT SERVICE BULLETINS WERE MERELY A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL TO ASSIST MECHANICS AND SINCE MY CAR WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, AND DESPITE THE VERY LOW MILEAGE, THE MOST I COULD EXPECT WAS TO MAKE AN APPT WITH THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT.

WE HAD BEEN DRIVING ON MAJOR INTERSTATES WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST THOUGHT THAT OUR KIA WAS POSSIBLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE. MORE RECENTLY ON THE 29TH OF JUNE, I JUST INSISTED THAT MY 19-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TAKE MY KIA TO NEW JERSEY BECAUSE I FELT THAT MY CAR WAS A BETTER CHOICE THAN HER OLDER MODEL FORD RANGER TO GO ON THAT LONG TRIP. IT WAS ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER SHE RETURNED HOME ON JUNE 30, 2018, THAT I WAS DRIVING MY HUSBAND AND TWO CHILDREN TO A GRADUATION PARTY NOT FAR FROM MY HOME WHEN THE CAR STOPPED WORKING WHILE I WAS OPERATING THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO STEER IT OFF OF THE ROAD WITH GREAT EFFORT AND WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT OR HARM TO MY FAMILY. I AM VERY UPSET OVER THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED.  ON MONDAY, MY HUSBAND SPOKE WITH THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR, AND HE FOUND OUT ABOUT A RECALL ON THE ENGINE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM INFURIATED!  I RESEARCHED THE RECALL AND SAW THAT ON YOUR WEBSITE THAT THE RECALL DATE IS 3/31/2017. I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO RESEARCH RECALLS. I HAVE MY VEHICLE REGULARLY SERVICED AND INSPECTED AT MY KIA DEALER OR ONE OF ITS OTHER AFFILIATED DEALERSHIPS AND AT NO TIME WAS I INFORMED THAT THIS RECALL WAS IN EFFECT. THIS RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR OVER A YEAR, AND I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE RECALL.   IT SHOULD BE THE MISSION OF ANY AUTOMOTIVE COMPANY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDING VIGILANT NOTIFICATION EFFORTS REGARDING RECALLS THAT COULD PUT DRIVERS IN LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS.  I FEEL THAT KIA HAS NOT PUT FORTH THEIR BEST EFFORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY.  WHEN I CALLED KIA, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS ONE MAILING AND NO FOLLOW UP WAS CONDUCTED. I DID NOT RECEIVE THE NOTICE IN THE MAIL.   MY CAR IS AT A KIA DEALER WAITING FOR AN ENGINE.",

THEY DETERMINED THERE WAS A BEARING ISSUE AND I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. THEY HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GIVING ME A COMPLETE ESTIMATE BECAUSE THEY HAD TROUBLE FINDING ALL PARTS NEEDED. I CONTACTED KIA ON MONDAY AND ASKED IF THEY COULD HELP ME AS I WAS JUST A BIT OVER THE 100,000 WARRANTY. THEY SUGGESTED I CALL KIA AND SPEAK TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AND OPEN A CASE WITH THEM. I OPENED A CASE AND THEY SUGGESTED I BRING MY CAR INTO KIA FOR A DIAGNOSTIC. I BROUGHT IT IN ON TUESDAY AND THEY CONFIRMED THERE WAS A BEARING ISSUE AND THE ENGINE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. I WAS QUOTED $7,700 BEFORE TAX FOR A RE-MANUFACTURED ENGINE AND OVER $12,000 FOR A FULLY ASSEMBLED ENGINE. MY REQUEST FOR KIA TO ASSIST ME WITH THIS REPAIR WAS PUT IN, I FORWARDED MY MAINTENANCE RECORDS TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SENT THAT ALONG WITH SOME PHOTOS THE DISTRICT PARTS AND SERVICE MANAGER REQUESTED OF MY ENGINE.

THEY SAID THAT THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF THERE WERE METAL SHAVINGS WOULD BE TO PULL THE OIL PAN ($195) AND THAT WOULD ONLY CONFIRM THAT SHAVINGS WERE IN THE OIL. TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT HAD CAUSED ENGINE FAILURE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PULL THE MAIN AND ROD BEARINGS ($400). THEY SAID THAT EVEN IF WE DID FIND THAT THE ENGINE FAILURE WAS DUE TO METAL SHAVINGS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF RECALL SC147 BECAUSE IT WASN'T MANUFACTURED AT A \"CERTAIN PLANT\" IN A \"CERTAIN MONTH\".  HE WAS UNABLE TO TELL ME WHAT PLANT AND MONTH. WE HAVE NOW FOUND, THROUGH DECODING OUR VIN, THAT THIS CAR WAS BUILT IN GEORGIA AND HAS THE THETA II ENGINE.

THIS WAS AT 2:00 AM. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED SINCE THAT TIME.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE HAD IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE ALREADY WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE HAD TO HAVE OUR VEHICLE JUMPED AT LEAST 12 TIMES DUE TO A DEAD BATTERY CAUSED BY THIS PROBLEM. THE VEHICLE FALLS WELL WITHIN IT'S WARRANTY SO IT WILL BE COVERED HOWEVER THE ISSUE IS SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT IT WARRANTS ATTENTION WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE IGNORED IF NOT BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND MAY RESULT IN INJURIES OR COST TO OTHERS WHEN NO COST SHOULD BE INCURRED.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. I FEEL THIS COULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS WITH STEERING, BRAKING SYSTEM, ENGINE MALFUNCTION AS WELL AS  POSSIBLE RISKS OF FIRE DUE TO A FAULTY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.",

RECEIVED CALL FROM DEALER AT 2PM THAT PART HAD ARRIVED AND BEEN INSTALLED BY TECH  BUT THAT ENGINE WAS STILL MAKING TICKING NOISE, SO NOT FIXED. WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN ON FRIDAY 12/26/14 WITH REQUEST TO KIA WARRANTY SERVICE FOR APPROVAL FOR \"ENGINE TEAR DOWN\", WHICH I WILL ALSO HAVE TO AUTHORIZED AND AGREE TO PAY $400.00 FOR (WAIVED IF ALL REPAIRS ARE COVERED BY WARRANTY). THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 53000 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR 30 MONTHS, ALL REGULAR MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES FOLLOWED AND THERE SHOULD NO WAY BE AN INTERNAL ENGINE PROBLEM ON A PROPERLY BUILT ENGINE. KIA HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THE ENGINE IN THIS CAR AND SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THE ENTIRE LINE OF 2013 SORENTO'S AND CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALER THAT \" WE MAY BE LOOKING AT A NEW ENGINE\". I HOPE NOT, EVEN THOUGH I COULD HAVE A ALMOST 3 YEAR OLD CAR WITH NO MILEAGE I DON'T WANT ONE, IF THE FIRST ENGINE HAS THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM WHAT WOULD THE SECOND ENGINE HAVE. I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO HOLD KIA RESPONSIBLE AND MAKE THEM COVER UNDER WARRANTY.   *TR",

RIGHT AFTER THIS HAPPENED THOUGH, I NOTICE A HUGE DECREASE IN MY FUEL MILEAGE. BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, I WAS GETTING 18/19 MPG/CITY AND 24-34 MPG/HWY (DEPENDING ON HOW FAR I WENT, OUT TO DEATH VALLEY W/NO STOPS, WE GOT 34). NOW I WAS LUCKY TO GET 13/14 MPG/CITY AND 16-18 MPG/HWY.

AFTER THEY SHARED WITH US THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY HELP W/THE FUEL MILEAGE, I WAS ECSTATIC! IT WENT RIGHT BACK UP TO WHERE IT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY! THEN, THE THING WITH THE IGNITION HAPPENED AGAIN! ONLY WORSE THIS TIME, JUST A FEW DAYS AGO! MY FUEL MILEAGE WENT BACK DOWN TO WHAT I SHARED ABOVE. WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND AFTER THEM TRYING ALL DAY TO REPLICATE WHAT HAPPENED (WHICH TOOK MONTHS FOR IT TO HAPPEN W/US), THEY FINALLY DID THE UPDATE, AGAIN.

I IMMEDIATELY TURNED ON THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE LANE AND WASN'T ABLE TO GET OVER TO THE RIGHT (NOBODY WOULD LET US GET OUT OF THE LANE WE WERE IN) TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE .WE ALMOST CAUSED MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS. MY WIFE WAS SCREAMING. I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GOING TO CREATE A MAJOR ACCIDENT.  NO MATTER WHAT I DID I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THE CAR STARTED AND IT CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. PEOPLE WERE GOING AROUND US ON BOTH SIDES BEEPING THEIR HORNS AND OTHER GESTURES. AFTER FOOLING WITH THE GEAR SHIFTER, I PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK IT STARTED BUT WHEN I PUT IT IN DRIVE IT STARTED TO MISS AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF STALLING WHEN I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL THE ENGINE STARTED TO RUN FINE. I THEN PUT IT IN LOW GEAR AND IT STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD, ONCE I GOT SOME SPEED (DID NOT LOOK AT THE SPEEDOMETER TO SEE HOW FAST I WAS GOING) I PUT IT IN DRIVE AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE AFTER THAT.  ALSO, THE VEHICLE RUNS ROUGH WHEN IN NEUTRAL AND WHILE IDLING WHEN IN GEAR (VARIES WITH NO RHYME OR REASON).  THE SERVICE ADVISOR INFORMED ME THAT KIA KNEW OF THE PROBLEM AND WERE WORKING ON IT. THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER WITHIN TWO WEEKS. IT IS AUGUST 13 AND THAT WAS JUNE 15. ON AUGUST 7 IT HAPPENED AGAIN...HAVING OTHER PROBLEMS AT TIMES, VEHICLE MISSING, STARTING TO STALL....I HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP EACH TIME A PROBLEM HAPPENED...SO FAR ALL I GOT IS LIP SERVICE.  CALLED SEVERAL HOURS AGO (TALKED TO THE SALESMAN) SAID HE WAS WITH A CUSTOMER AND WILL GET BACK TO ME. NO RESPONSE FROM HIM SO FAR.  I AM AT A LOST AS TO WHAT TO DO MY WIFE IS SCARED AND WILL NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  I AM WORRIED THAT I MAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS PROBLEM SOLVED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR EVEN WORST.  *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY TOLD THE ASSOCIATE AND HE SAID TO BRING THE CAR IN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THE FOLLOWING DAY TO HAVE IT INSPECTED AND SAID IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HE SAID IT'S UNDER WARRANTY SO IT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN THE NEXT DAY AND THE SERVICE MAN TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS LIKELY JUST THAT IT NEEDED TO BREAK-IN SINCE IT ONLY HAD A FEW MILES ON IT. THEY RAN TESTS ON THE CAR AND EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT FINE. THE MAN SUGGESTED WE TAKE IT FOR A LONG DRIVE AND PUT A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES ON IT AND SEE HOW IT WAS RUNNING AFTERWARD. WE DID SO AND THE PROBLEM DID NOT GET BETTER. WE BROUGHT IT IN THE NEXT DAY TO BE INSPECTED AGAIN AND THE SERVICE MEN TOOK IT FOR A SHORT DRIVE TO SEE IF THEY COULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THEY NOTED THEY DID. OUR SALES ASSOCIATE TOLD US HE LOOKED INTO THIS VIBRATION PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT KIA WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WERE WORKING ON A FIX FOR A COMPUTER CHIP THAT WAS AFFECTING THE 4 CYLINDER 2013 SORENTOS. HE TOLD US KIA DID NOT HAVE A TIMEFRAME FOR FIXING THE PROBLEM BUT IT SHOULD BE SOON, BUT THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH ALL 4 CYLINDERS THAT THEY ARE MAKING.  *TR",
