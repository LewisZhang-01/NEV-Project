IT SEEMS AS IF THE FLEXING OF THE FRONT CAP CAUSES THE WINDSHIELD TO POP OUT OF THE RUBBER SEAL AT THE TOP IN SOME CASES  TO 1 INCH, 6-8 INCHES IN LENGTH. THIS CREATES A PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG THE ROAD AND IT POPS OUT. IT ALLOWS WATER TO COME IN AND MAKE YOU WONDER IF THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD WILL FALL OUT OR WORSE BLOW IN ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER. THE MANUFACTURER, THOR WILL NOT HONOR THE PROBLEM AND BLOW IT OFF.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM ON ALL MODELS WITH TWO PIECE WINDSHIELDS.",

IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE HAD THE WINDSHIELD POP OUT OF THE RUBBER GASKET CAUSING LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER TO COME IN DURING RAIN STORMS. WE SEALED THE WINDSHIELD THE BEST WE COULD TO KEEP OUT THE RAIN BUT THE GLASS WAS COMING OUT FURTHER AND FURTHER. WE TOOK IT TO A DEALER AND THEY REMOVED THE WINDSHIELDS AND CLEANED THE RUBBER GASKET. AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS USE THE WINDSHIELD POPPED OUT AGAIN ON THE TOP. THE DEALER THEN DECIDED THE COACH NEEDED A NEW RUBBER GASKET. THE DEALER THEN WENT REPLACED THE GASKET AND RE-INSTALLED THE WINDSHIELDS. AFTER A WEEK OF USE THE TOP OF THE GLASS WAS POPPED OUT OF THE NEW RUBBER GASKET.  THE DEALER DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO KNOW. THE DAMON COMPANY NOW THOR MOTOR COACH, PO BOX 1486  ELKHART, INDIANA 46515 SHOULD BE MAKING A RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. IT IS HAPPENING ON MANY OF THE OLDER DAMON MODELS FROM 2002 - 2009",
