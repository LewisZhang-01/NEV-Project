THE PUMP ITSELF IS INSIDE OF A PLASTIC HOUSING THAT CRACKS (APPARENTLY IN A PRETTY SPECIFIC AREA) AND CAUSING A CATASTROPHIC LOSS IN FUEL PRESSURE WHICH YIELDS HARD STARTING, ROUGH RUNNING UNDER LOAD OR STEADY THROTTLE (DECEL BACKFIRING POPPING AND SNAPPING ALSO) AND BIKE WILL DIE WHILE IDLING OR, IN MY CASE, WHILE RIDING DOWN THE ROAD IN TRAFFIC. I WAS LUCKY THAT I MADE I HOME. YAMAHA IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND NOW THEY HAVE A NEW MODEL NUMBER 1D7-13907-01-00 WHICH SUPERSEDES 1D7-13907-00-00.
