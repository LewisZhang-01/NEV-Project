THE REPAIR MAN SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.  I KEPT THE BOLTS AND TOOK PICTURES.  I CONTACTED CROSSROADS TO COMPLAIN AND WAS TOLD MY UNIT WAS NOT THE ONE INVOLVED FOR THE RECALL (JUST 1 YEAR DIFFERENCE IN MODEL) FOR THE EXACT SAME THING.  THE LUG BOLTS HAVE BEEN TORQUED BY MYSELF TO 110 PSI AS RECENTLY AS 1 2 WEEKS BEFORE MY TRIP.  THIS SEPARATION FROM MY VEHICLE PUT MY FAMILIES SAFETY AT RISK.  CROSSROADS IS TAKING NO RESPONSIBILITY.    I HAVE PICTURES OF THE HUB AFTER WHEEL SEPARATION ON MY PHONE.  I CAN SUBMIT IF YOU GIVE ME A NUMBER TO TEXT OR EMAIL THEM.",
