THE WEATHER WAS FINE, NOT PARTICULARLY WINDY OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD A LOUD POPPING SOUND. I LOOKED IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE PASSENGER-SIDE BACK WINDOW IMPLODING INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN. IT WAS THE VERY BACK SIDE WINDOW, THE ONE THAT IS ABLE TO BE VENTED MANUALLY. IT WAS NOT VENTED AT THE TIME OF THE IMPLOSION. I HAD NOT SEEN ANY PROJECTILES SAILING THROUGH THE AIR THAT COULD'VE HIT THE WINDOW. I HAD NOT SEEN ANY CRACKS OR IMPERFECTIONS IN THE WINDOW. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I AM FACING IS THAT THIS IS THE 2ND TIME GLASS HAS MYSTERIOUSLY BROKEN IN THE VEHICLE. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, THE BACK WINDSHIELD SHATTERED WHEN I GOT INTO THE VAN AND SHUT THE DOOR. IN THAT INSTANCE, I WAS PARKED, AND THE VEHICLE HADN'T EVEN BEEN TURNED ON YET. IN THAT CASE, AT LEAST THERE WASN'T FLYING GLASS INSIDE OF THE CAR. I AM OFFICIALLY FRUSTRATED (AND TERRIFIED) WITH THIS PROBLEM, AND AM VERY HAPPY THERE WASN'T ANYONE SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE VAN WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THIS HAPPENED 4 DAYS AGO, AND I HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN IT FIXED. I AM CURRENTLY EXPLORING DIFFERENT AVENUES TO EXPRESS MY DISTRUST AND ANGER AT THIS SITUATION. I ALSO DO NOT BELIEVE THIS HAD TO DO WITH A DRIVING ERROR COMMITTED ON MY PART. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE RESOLVED, IDEALLY WITH DODGE REPLACING MY WINDOW FREE OF CHARGE.

SO I CALLED MY DEALER TO SCHEDULE AN APPT FOR MULTIPLE OF REASONS AND THEY FOUND THE FOLLOWING ISSUES AGAIN WITH MY CAR; MY FRONT BRAKES (SHOE PADES, ROTOR'S TURNED) NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN SINCE I'VE HAD THIS CAR AND THE CAR ONLY HAS 45,000 MILES ON IT AND PREVIOUS TO THAT, THE DEALER REPLACED THE SHOE PADES AGAIN AT 19,000 MILES?? ALSO AT 19,000 MILES, THE DEALER HAD TO REPLACE THE \"BUSHINGS AND LINKS\" FOR THE FRONT END AND AGAIN AT 45,000 MILES TWO DAYS AGO. I AM STRATING TO WONDER IF THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS GOING PREMATURELY. I ALSO HAD TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES BECAUSE DUE TO THE WEAR/TEAR ON THEM BECASUE THEY WERE UNSAFE. THE DEALER WON'T WARRENTY THEM, SO I HAD TO BUY NEW SET OF TIRES AT 19,000 MILES. I THINK THE TIRES WORN OUT PREMATURELY DUE TO ALL THE FRONT END PROBLEMS THAT I AM HAVING. THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF \"POWER STEERING\" ISSUES WITH MY VEHICHLE SINCE I PURCHASED IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN TWO RECALLS ON THE POWER STEERING UNIT AND HAD THE DEALER TAKE CARE OF THEM.(HAD THE CAR TOWED BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING WON'T WORK AND IT LEAKED ALL OVER MY NEW DRIVEWAY) I 'VE HAD THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES FOR \"POWER STEERING\" LEAKING. THE LATEST NEW WAS THE A \"BOOT\" OF SOME SORT IN THE \"RACK-AND-PINION STEERING\" WAS THE CAUSE OF THE POWER STEERING LEAK AND THEY ALSO FOUND AN OIL LEAK ON THE HEADCASK COVER TOO. AFTER EVERYTHING WAS FINALLY FINIHSED (AFTER 2 DAYS) I PICKED UP THE CAR AND DROVE IT HOME BUT I AM GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE DEALSHIP BECAUSE NOW THE CAR IS SWAYING LEFT/RIGHT AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY DID A FRONT END ALIGNEMENT BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK THEY HAD TO DUE TO THE VEHICLE.  *JB",

THE TAIL LIGHT LENSES OR COVERS HAVE BEEN GLUED ON BUT THE GLUE HAS FAILED ON  BOTH TAIL LIGHTS AND BOTH COVERS HAVE FALLEN OFF ONTO THE FREEWAY EXPOSING THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT BULBS AND DROPPING A LARGE PLASTIC LENS ONTO THE FREEWAY.  WHEN THE FIRST ONE FELL OFF MY WIFE STOPPED ON THE FREEWAY AND  PICKED UP THE LENS.  WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GET KILLED.  THE SECOND TIME I WAS DRIVING AT NIGHT ON THE FREEWAY AND HEARD A NOISE BUT DID NOT STOP UNTIL I LEFT THE FREEWAY.  THE DEALER SELLS THE ENTIRE LIGHT ASSEMBLY FOR  $ 99.00 BUT THE LENS COVER IS NOT SOLD SEPARATELY.  LOOKS LIKE A GOOD  FUNDRAISER FOR THE DEALER BUT A DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR EVERYONE ON THE ROAD.  THE PROBLEM IS THE NEW LENS HAS THE SAME DESIGN AND WAS BUILT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL ONE.  I TALKED TO THE SALES CLERK AT THE DODGE  PARTS COUNTER AND HE SAID \"WE HAVE SOLD A LOT OF THESE LATELY.\"  SO THIS IS  NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENCE.  IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PEOPLE ARE INJURED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.    IF THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER MOTORS CORPORATION ACTS RESPONSIBLE AND SOLVES THIS PROBLEM QUICKLY LIVES CAN BE SAVED AND INJURIES AVOIDED.    THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE NOTICED A LENS COVER FOR A VEHICLE LIGHT COVER THAT WAS NOT ATTACHED WITH SCREWS.   THE GOOD THING IS THERE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO SOLVE THIS  PROBLEM.  DRILL TWO HOLES IN THE PLASTIC LENS AND INSTALL TWO SCREWS AS  I HAVE DONE TO THE LENS COVER RETRIEVED FROM THE FREEWAY BY MY WIFE. AFTER DISCOVERING THIS PROBLEM I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY AS MANY PEOPLE AS NECESSARY TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS MATTER.  *JB",

IT HAS TURNED OFF THREE TIMES AND I WENT TO SPEAK TO MY SALES REP TOM ZULLI WHO DID NOT HELP THEN I SPOKE TO MIKE IN SERVICE AND HE DOES NOT HELP AND ROB UPSON THE GENERAL MANAGER WHO WAS VERY NASTY BECAUSE I ASKED HIM FOR A REPLACEMENT VAN OR A REFUND. THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP IS NEIL DODGE AT 1788 ROUTE 112, MEDFORD NY 11763. I FEEL AS IF IF I DO NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS I HAVE REPORTED THEM TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, DAIMLER CHRYSLER NOONE IS HELPING ME. I GAVE A 10,000 DEPOSIT AND I HAVE DRIVEN MY VAN A TOTAL OF ONE WEEK AND I AM GOING ON MY SECOND PAYMENT BUT I DO NOT HAVE MY VAN. THIS LAST TIME I PICKED IT UP AFTER IT BEING IN SERVICE FOR 3 THREE WEEKS THE VERY NEXT DAY IT WOULD NOT TURN ON. WHEN I CALLED NEIL DODGE IT TOOK THEM 3 DAYS TO PICK IT UP AND WHEN THEY DID, I HAD TO CALL MORE THAN 5 TIMES THAT DAY. THEY HAVE HAD THE VAN OVER A WEEK AND STILL NOT ONE CALL. THEY HAVE GIVEN ME A RENTAL IN THE MEANTIME AND ACCORDING TO ROB UPSON THEY DO NOT HAVE TO. IT WAS DONE AS A FAVOR. THE CATCH TO THIS RENTAL IS THAT I HAVE TO PAY $13.00 A DAY FOR INSURANCE SINCE 12/28/02. I STILL HAVE THE RENTAL BECAUSE MY VAN IS STILL IN REPAIRS AND NOONE KNOWS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE VAN. WHEN I PURCHASED THE VAN MR. TOM ZULLI TOLD ME THE PRIOR OWNER OF THIS VAN RETURNED IT BECAUSE HE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO PAY IT. WHEN I CALLED DAIMLER CHRYSLER THEY INFORMED ME IT WAS A RENTAL, OF COURSE THEY GAVE  ME A PAPER SAYING SO, WHICH I SIGNED NOT KNOWING BUT THEY GAVE MORE THAN 10 FORMS TO SIGN HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT I WAS BEING TRICKED.
