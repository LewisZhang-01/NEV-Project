MY JEEP ALREADY HAD THE INSULATOR INSTALLED BUT BECAUSE THE VALVE COVER GASKET BROKE AND LEAKED OIL ALL OVER THE INSULATOR BLANKET AND SOAKED IT WITH OIL AND MADE IT A FIRE A HAZARD, I THREW IT AWAY THINKING THAT I CAN JUST BUY A NEW ONE FROM CHRYSLER.    I WENT ONTO IWANTMOPAR.COM, A FCA DEALERSHIP (MCGOVERN CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE RAM ON 777 WASHINGTON ST, NEWTON, MA 02460), AND ORDERED SIX INJECTOR SHIELDS AND AN INSULATOR BLANKET TO REPLACE THE ONE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ON MY JEEP.  THREE WEEK PASSED AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THEM REFUSING TO SELL ME THE RECALL PARTS, STATING THAT MY JEEP HAD THESE PARTS ALREADY.    HOW CAN A DEALERSHIP REFUSE TO SELL ME PARTS THAT MAKE MY JEEP SAFE AND COMPLIANT WITH FEDERAL LAWS?    THANKS",

I FINALLY TURNED THE KEY OFF AND STOPPED. THIS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND I WISH I WOULD HAVE REACTED SOONER. THE LEFT FRONT FENDER AND GRILL WERE DAMAGED AND  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A REPAIR SHOP.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND THEY STRIPPED OFF THE COVERING REVEALING A CRACKED BOTTOM SEAT FRAME. THEY ORDERED A JEEP BOTTOM SEAT FRAME AT A COST OF $363.75 AND CHARGED ME LABOR OF $281.00 TO STRIP OFF THE COVERING, INSTALL THE SEAT AND RECOVER ACCORDINGLY.    ALSO, TO COMPOUND THE AFOREMENTIONED NEITHER THE DRIVER'S SIDE OR PASSENGER SIDE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS FUNCTION. THIS IS NOT A RESULT OF THE SEAT FRAME AS STATED ABOVE.     IS THERE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN RENDER IN TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENT?  I CAN PROVIDE PHOTOS OF THE FAILED SEAT FRAME ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS COPIES OF THE MONIES PAID TO TAKE CARE OF THE REPAIR.    II HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM EXTENSIVELY ON THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE VOLUMES OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. A SERIOUS RESIDUAL OF THIS SEAT FRAME FAILURE HAS RESULTED IN THE SEAT TOTALLY COLLAPSING TO THE REAR WITH A SUDDEN STOP OR IMPACT LEAVING THE DRIVER IN A DANGEROUS RECLINING POSITION.  IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO REPORT IT TO THE PROPER AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES. PLEASE HELP BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR KILLED. *TR    THANK YOU.",

PRIOR TO THIS, I TEST DROVE THE JEEP AND NOTICED THE BRAKES DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SLOWING AS FAST AS I FELT IT SHOULD.  THE SEIZED PINS ARE THE REASON FOR THIS BECAUSE AS THE PADS WEAR, THE PINS SHOULD SLIDE INWARD TO ACCOMMODATE THE WEAR.

I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE NHTSA.  IT IS A REAL PROBLEM:  I HAVE 6 MO OLD TWINS AND A 4 YO SON.  THEY ARE 3 ACROSS IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY 2001 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LIMITED.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE BELTS HOLDING THE INFANT SEATS HAVE BECOME UNDONE AFTER MAKING SURE REPEATEDLY THAT THEY WERE BUCKLED AND TAUT.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A REAL PROBLEM!  I EVEN WENT SO FAR AS GRILLING MY 4 YO IF HE UNDID THE BUCKLES IN 'FUN'.  HE REPEATEDLY DENIED IT.  HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT TO THE FAR OUTBOARD SEAT (HE SITS IN THE OTHER OUTBOARD SEAT) WHILE I WAS DRIVING, AND THAT'S WHEN I BEGAN TO SCRATCH MY HEAD.  THEN I THOUGHT, WELL OK, MAYBE MY INFANT CAR SEATS ARE REALLY  CLUNKY AND SOMETIMES WHEN I LOCK THEM INTO THE BASE OR GET THEM OUT, THEY ARE JOSTLING THE BELT OPEN.  BUT, WOULD THAT BE OK EITHER??  THE BELT LOCK IS INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE AND DEFECTIVE.

THE DOORS ARE CONTROLLED BY A STEPPER MOTOR THAT SEEKS AN OPEN AND CLOSE SETTING EVERY 20 TIMES THE JEEP IS STARTED.  THE END POINTS FOR OPEN OR CLOSED ARE SET BY A PLASTIC PIN THAT IS PART OF THE PLASTIC DOOR ASSEMBLY.  WHEN THIS PIN BREAKS, THE STOP POINTS BECOME  THE OPEN AND CLOSED POSITION OF THE DOOR.  EVENTUALLY, THE DOORS WILL BREAK(SEE PICTURE).  THE MOST COMMON FAIL MODE IS FOR THE BROKEN DOOR TO FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX, BLOCKING THE HEATER CORE NO HEAT.  ALSO, IN THIS POSITION, THE DOOR DOES NOT DO AN EFFICIENT JOB OF BLOCKING THE HEAT INPUT, AND THE AC EFFICIENCY SUFFERS.  THE DOOR CAN ALSO HANG IN A POSITION WHERE IT CLOSES NEITHER THE HEATER CORE NOR AC CONDENSER INLETS.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU HAVE A CONSTANT MIXTURE OF HEAT AND AC?TOO COLD IN THE WINTER AND TOO HOT IN THE SUMMER.  -  THE FACTORY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE DOORS AND HOUSING WITH AN UPGRADED PART THAT HAS A STRONGER PLASTIC PIN TO WITHSTAND THE CONSTANT OPENING AND CLOSING WHEN THE STEPPER SEEKS ITS BEGINNING POSITION.  THE REPAIR ENTAILS REMOVING THE DASH PANEL, STEERING WHEEL, ALL VACUUM AND WIRING HARNESSES, DRAINING THE COOLANT, EVACUATING THE AC SYSTEM, AND FINALLY REMOVING AND REPAIRING THE HEATER BOX.

WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PUT INTO PARK, IT WOULD ROLL.  THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REWORKED WITH ALL NEW SEALS AND GASKETS AND THE DAMAGED OVERDRIVE COMPONENTS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  ALTHOUGH I FOUND DOCUMENTATION ONLINE THAT STATED THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO 70,000 MILES, CHRYSLER WOULD NOT EVEN LISTEN TO MY COMPLAINT.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ACTUALLY HUNG UP ON ME WHEN I CALLED.  THE TOTAL BILL WAS $1,863.78.  THE DEALERSHIP ALSO FOUND A DEFECTIVE GOVERNOR PRESSURE SENSOR WHICH WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS PROBLEM HAD OCCURRED BEFORE.  IT CAUSED THE VEHICLE NOT TO START BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR SENSOR DETECTED THE VEHICLE WAS IN GEAR WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY IN PARK.  I'VE ALSO HAD CONSTANT PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES AND ROTORS.  HAVE ALREADY SPENT ABOUT $1,000 ON THOSE AND THE REPAIRS ONLY LAST FOR ABOUT 10,000 TO 20,000 MILES.  THE FRONT END SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY WHEN BRAKING ABOVE 35 MPH WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN MEETING ONCOMING TRAFFIC. IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE FRONT END, IT IS VERY EASY TO CRASH RIGHT INTO AN ONCOMING VEHICLE.  I'VE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL JEEP OWNERS AND READ MANY COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEMS I'VE HAD.  I HAVE ENGAGED AN ATTORNEY AND WE WILL BE NOTIFYING CHRYSLER OF A LAWSUIT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  *NM",

WHEN THE SOCKET BURNS OUT, THE TAIL LIGHTS STOP WORKING ONCE YOU TURN THE HEADLIGHTS ON.  MY VEHICLE HAS AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS AND THIS TRULY CAUSES A BIG PROBLEM.

EACH SOCKET IS BURNED OUT LIKE EACH OF THE SOCKETS THAT I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION.  2) THE OUTSIDE RAIL THAT CONNECTS THE DRIVERS SEAT TO THE RISERS BREAKS, CONVERTING THE DRIVERS SEAT TO A ROCKING CHAIR.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE SERVICE AND PARTS DEPARTMENTS ALL OF THE JEEP DEALERS IN A 100 MILE RADIUS OF ZIP CODE (20744) AND WAS TOLD THAT THESE ISSUES ARE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEPS FROM 1994 TO 2004.

BRAKE PULSATION DUE TO BRAKE ROTORS HAVING EXCESSIVE RUN OUT (WARPED ROTORS) IS A SAFTEY ISSUE.

EXCESSIVE HEAT IN ROTORS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL ROTOR WARPAGE AND POSSIBLY ROTOR FAILURE, AND, INEFFECTIVE BRAKING;  B. EXCESSIVE HEAT IN CALIPERS, RESULTING IN CALIPER FAILURE, AND, POSSIBLE BRAKE FAILURE; C. EXCESSIVE HEAT IN BRAKE FLUID, RESULTING IN INEFFECTIVE BRAKING.

THE CHRYSLER PHONE REP ALL BUT ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF THIS IN OTHER YEARS OF GRAND CHEROKEES  AND THE WEBSITES CONFIRMED THAT.  I TOOK IT IN ON FEBRUARY 15, 2002, TO THE DEALER.  THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE ROTORS WERE BAD AND REPLACED THEM.  THEY DID NOT CHARGE ME BECAUSE I HAD JUST HIT 10,000 MILES, BUT INDICATED THAT THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER FUTURE SUCH FAILURES.  FROM MY WEBSITE READING, I LEARNED THAT A RECURRENCE WAS HIGHLY LIKELY.  WITHIN THE LAST TEN DAYS, I HAVE NOTICED THE SHUDDERING OF THE BRAKES COMING BACK -- AS BEFORE, I EXPECT IT WILL GET WORSE AND I WILL NEED ANOTHER ROTORS REPLACEMENT.  I AM NOW AT 12,488 MILES SO THESE ROTORS ARE FAILING FAST.  IT SEEMS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE IF THE BRAKES WILL HOLD  PARTICULARLY AT HIGHER SPEEDS,  IT'S VERY DISCONCERTING TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SHAKE AS YOU BRAKE.  I HAVE DRIVEN FOR THIRTY YEARS, HAD SEVERAL NEW CARS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THIS BEFORE EVER.  I DO NOT RIDE MY BRAKES, HAVE A PERFECT DRIVING RECORD,  AND KNOW FROM THE WEBSITES THAT THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH GRAND CHEROKEES OF MORE RECENT VINTAGE.  I ANTICIPATE THE DEALER WILL TELL ME I HAVE TO PAY NEXT TIME,  AND I FEEL THIS WOULD BE WRONG.  NOT ONLY SHOULD THE WARRANTY COVER IT,  BUT CHRYSLER SHOULD  FESS UP THAT THERE IS A BRAKE ROTOR  DEFECT AND FIX IT.  I DO NOT RELISH THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THIS HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN,  AND IT DEFINITELY IS A HUGE NEGATIVE WHILE DRIVING - THE BRAKES SEEM LIKE THEY COULD FAIL.  MY LONG PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE CHRYSLER REP IN FEBRUARY LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT CHRSYLER WOULD ACT ON THIS. SO FAR, NO NEWS.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL.

WHILE THE WARRANTY IS 12,000 MILES, THE ROTORS MEET THAT MINIMUM. HOWEVER, OTHER MANUFACTURERS APPLY A  36,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THEIR BRAKE SYSTEMS WITH THEIR ROTORS NOT WARPING AT ALL, EVEN BEYOND THEIR WARRANTY PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, MY BROTHERS FORD F150 HAS OVER 70,000 ON THE ORIGINAL BRAKES & PADS, WITH ABOUT 1/4 \" PAD REMAINING...AND NO WARPAGE, NOR \"SKEWING\" ON THE ROTORS. IT IS MY FEELING THAT JEEP HAS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS BRAKE SYSTEM ON THE ROAD. FURTHERMORE, SINCE THE OTHER 19 NHTSA REPORTS THAT I'VE READ HAVE NO ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY LOSSES,  THERE HAS BEEN NO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TAKEN ON JEEP. NEVERTHELESS, IF JEEP WANTS TO CUT COSTS, DON'T DO IT WITH A CRITICAL SAFETY SYSTEM LIKE THE BRAKES. THEIR ROTORS JUST BARELY LAST THROUGH THE WARRANTY PERIOD.

AS I TURNED BACK TO THE VEHICLE, AFTER LOCKING THE GATE, I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE \"REVERSE BACK-UP LIGHTS\" WERE ON.  THAT WAS A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT THE VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION WAS IN \"REVERSE\" NOT \"PARK.\"  LUCKILY, THE VEHICLE DID NOT MOVE TOWARDS ME.  I THEN RE-ENTERED THE VEHICLE VIA THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR, AND OBSERVED THAT THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER WAS ACTUALLY IN \"REVERSE\"  CONFIRMING WHAT WAS INDICATED BY THE BACK UP LIGHTS BEING ON.  PUZZLED THAT THIS HAPPENED, I ATTEMPTED ON SEVERAL TRIES OF SHIFTING THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER TO ASCERTAIN IF I COULD RECREATE THE SAME CONDITION (I.E., OF SHIFTING INTO \"PARK\" BY \"FEEL\" AND ACTUALLY STOPPING IN \"REVERSE\"  ONE POSITION SHORT OF THE \"PARK\" POSITION).  I WAS ABLE TO DO SO, THAT IS, INCORRECTLY STOPPING AT \"REVERSE.\"  SINCE I DRIVE THIS CAR AT NIGHT MOST WEEKNIGHTS, I WOULD NORMALLY SHIFT THE CAR INTO \"PARK\" BY FEEL.

SUFFICE IT TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE PARKING BRAKE WILL NOT HOLD THE VEHICLE FROM MOVING WHILE FULLY OPERATIONAL IF THE ACCELERATOR IS PRESSED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN \"REVERSE.\"  THE \"DEFECT\" OR SHORTCOMING IN THIS CASE, APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF A FAULTY SAFETY BUTTON THAT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER MECHANISM.  I NOTICED A DISTINCT PATTERN OF THE SHIFT LEVER STOPPING AT \"REVERSE\"  AS IF IN \"PARK\"   IF THE BUTTON IS NOT COMPLETELY PRESSED WHILE SHIFTING THE LEVER FORWARD TOWARDS \"PARK.\"  THE BUTTON MECHANISM HAS A RANGE OF MOTION THAT ALLOWS AN INCOMPLETE PROTECTIVE ACTION, STOPPING THE LEVER AT \"REVERSE\"   ONE NOTCH SHORT OF \"PARK.\"*AK",

A FLORIDA ROAD RANGER ASSISTED ME AND CHANGED MY TIRE WITH THE SPARE.  MY TIRE DID NOT HIT ANY OBJECT NOR DID ANY OBJECT HIT MY TIRE.  I CONTACTED GOODYEAR AND SHOWED THEM THE TIRE AT THEIR GOODYEAR TIRE CENTER LOCATED AT 7511 49TH STREET, PINELLAS PARK, FLORIDA 33782..(727) 547-8422. THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRE UNTIL I GAVE THEM MY OLD TIRE TO BE SHIPPED, AT MY EXPENSE, TO CORPORATE GOODYEAR'S TEST LABS.  A LITTLE LIKE THE FOX WATCHING THE HEN HOUSE IN MY OPINION.  I GOT ALOT OF BS FROM GOODYEAR AND EXPLAINATIONS ABOUT THE TIRE FAILURE THAT WITH A LITTLE COMMON SENSE DIDN'T ADD UP. THIS TIRE IS VISUALLY A DEFECT FROM THE LOOKS OF THE TREAD SEPERATION FROM THE SIDEWALL, JUST LIKE I HAVE SEEN ON THE NEWS WITH THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  THE LOCAL GOODYEAR DEALER DIDN'T SATISFY ME AND DIDN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT MY NEEDS SO, I CONTACTED GOODYEAR CORPORATE BY PHONE.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SIDEWALL LOOKED ALL SHREDED UP BECAUSE THE TIRE ROLLED ON ITSELF DEFLATED AT THE 65 MPH SPEED AS I COASTED TO AT STOP ( THANK GOD I DIDN'T PANIC AND USE MY BRAKES) ( IN HEAVY RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC ON A FOUR LANE BRIDGE TRAVELING IN THE THIRD LANE ).  IF THEIR THEORY ABOUT SHREDING IS TRUE, WHY DIDN'T THE INTERIOR SIDEWALL GET SHREDED?  IT LOOKS LIKE NEW. THEY'RE FULL OF EXCUSES.  I WANT ALL OF THESE TIRES OFF MY TRUCK.  IF I HAVE MY FAMILY RIDING IN THIS VEHICLE I DON'T FEEL SAFE KNOWING WHAT MIGHT OCCUR.   PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT MY TIRE.

I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALER TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN OVER A NEW VEHICLE WITH SUCH A ROUGH TRANSMISSION. I WAS ASSURED BY THE SERVICE DEPT. THAT ALL THE NEW ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONS STARTED OFF ROUGH THE 1ST THOUSAND MILES, AND THAT IT NEEDED TO BREAK IN. I GAVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL; NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVING EXPERIENCED SUCH A HORRIBLY ROUGH TRANSMISSION- ESP. ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE. AFTER 1000 MILES, THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT, AND I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO BE EVALUATED. I WAS ASSURED BY THE MECHANIC THAT ALL THE GRAND CHEROKEES TRANSMISSIONS ARE LIKE THIS- IT'S A BUILD UP OF THE HYDROLIC FLUIDS OR SOMETHING. I ONCE AGAIN BELIEVED THEM (NOT REALLY) AND WENT ON MY WAY. THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO DO THIS, THE SOUND GETTING VERY LOUD AND QUITE STARTLING AT TIMES WHILE IN TRAFFIC. IT ALSO IS QUITE EMBARASSING WITH PASSENGERS IN THE CAR WHO ALSO HAVE BECOME QUITE STARTLED BY THE LOUDNESS AND SHEER FORCE OF THE LURCHING. I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN A SECOND TIME FOR EVALUATION ONLY TO BE TOLD, NOTHING WAS WRONG. IT IS MY FEELING THAT THIS IS A SEVERE DEFECT OF SOME SORT. IN ALL MY YEARS OF DRIVING, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH PROBLEMS- EXCEPT MAYBE FROM A MANUAL TRANSMISSION THAT BUCKED. I AM PLANNING TO TAKE MY CAR IN YET A THIRD TIME AND DEMAND THE PROBLEM BE RESOLVED, OR I WILL BE INVOKING MY RIGHTS UNDER THE LEMON LAWS. IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT PROBLEMS WITH GRAND CHEROKEES, AND THEIR SHIFTING INTO GEAR WHILE IDLING, I CANNOT SAY THAT I AM SURPRISED.
