        "summary": "On January 2, 2022 my family and I were leaving our campsite. We drove approximately 3 miles on a dirt ride to the highway, we stopped prior to entering the highway, opened up the trailer and rechecked the cargo; everything appeared normal. We entered onto the highway and within approximately 8 minutes there was a huge explosion; as I looked in my mirror I saw the side of the trailer fly off and flames coming from the trailer. My wife was behind me in our other vehicle and stated the rear door had blown off also and the flames were coming from the kitchen area which is on the passenger side. As I pulled over there were several more explosions, the trailer was a total loss and my truck was severely damaged. We had the refrigerator running on propane and I believe with the very short amount of time between the explosion and the last time we checked that a line either disconnected or ruptured. The trailer was only two months old, and was never inspected by the dealer prior to delivery. Trailer was originally sold at silver line trailers in Missouri and given to a family member when Stealth fired them as a dealer, the family member then sold to me as a new unit; everything was still factory wrapped, shipping valves were closed and propane tanks were sealed. This information I received from there sales manager Chad Friesner. He also stated that they had several propane line issues with the frame punching them during assembly.",
