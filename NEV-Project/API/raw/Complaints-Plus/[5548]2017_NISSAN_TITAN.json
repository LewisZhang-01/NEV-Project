        "summary": "I purchased my 2017 Nissan Titan SV in 2018 from a dealership in Conyers Georgia. I have taken great care of the truck and performed all regular and millage maintenance to the truck from day 1. I noticed in 2019, while driving on the roadway to merge onto interstate I85 that the vehicle had a lag in acceleration causing an RPM surge which delayed the vehicle from accelerating onto the interstate properly almost causing an accident. The truck would not properly get up to speed causing me to have to pull over to the side of the road and evaluate and re start the truck.The check engine light became displayed. The truck continued to display the same behavior with the surging of RPMs and drag during acceleration. I took the vehicle to Mall of Georgia Nissan, where they took the vehicle in and diagnosed it. I was advised by Nissan that they contacted Nissan Corporate to get advise on the issue and to seek a resolution, in which they performed some type of re flash of the transmission and several other transmission related fixes, but stated that the transmission was fine. I picked up the vehicle and it seemed to be running better than before, however a lag during acceleration was still noticeable. I noticed in January 2022 that the check engine light came on once again after the vehicle stalled while accelerating causing the truck to jerk and me once again pull over on the side of the road. I have been advised by my local mechanic after diagnosing the truck that there is a large amount of metal in the transmission fluid and that the vehicle will most likely need a new transmission. My truck has 122k miles and is in great shape, and also paid for with hopes to continue driving it well past 122k miles. This issue with the transmission which occurred within warranty was not properly diagnosed and fixed in 2019 causing a continuing safety hazard on the roadway. Nissan corporate is refusing to take responsibility of this issue and acknowledge the transmission issues.",

LUCKILY NO CARS WERE COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND I STEERED HARD TO THE RIGHT AND SLOWED THE VEHICLE DOWN RAPIDLY. I DROVE A SHORT DISTANCE TO A GRAVEL PARKING LOT OF A CHURCH AND WE EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND COULD SEE THE SERPENTINE BELT WAS NO LONGER IN PLACE. THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP 55 MILES AWAY AND WE AWAITED THEIR REPORT. SEVERAL DAYS LATER I WAS INFORMED THAT THE BELT TENSIONER BRACKET HAD BROKEN IN HALF AND NISSAN WAS GOING TO ORDER PARTS AS THEY WERE NOT IN STOCK AT THE DEALER. REMEMBER THIS IS A NEW 2017 TRUCK WITH ONLY 5000 MILES ON IT. THE SERPENTINE BELT RUNS ALL ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE AND WITHOUT IT ENGAGED THE VEHICLE BECOMES UNDRIVEABLE.
