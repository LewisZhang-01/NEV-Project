I LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE  ACURA TL ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.  ANOTHER ISSUE I'M EXPERIENCING IS WITH THE 3RD GEAR WHICH I ALSO FOUND OUT TO BE COMMON WITH THE ACURAS. SOMETIMES WHILE DRIVING, THE STICK WOULD NOT GO INTO 3RD GEAR SMOOTHLY OR SOMETIMES IT JUST POPS OUT OF THE 3RD GEAR.  THE THIRD AND FINAL COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE READ ABOUT AND STARTING TO EXPERIENCE IS RATTLING. THE INTERIOR CABIN OF THE CAR THOUGH QUIET FROM EXTERIOR NOISE SEEMS TO BE MAKING SOME NOISE OF ITS OWN FROM THE INSIDE STARTING WITH THE WINDOWS.

THE DEALER COURTESY ACURA AND THE MANUFACTURE ACURA ARE FULLY AWARE THAT ACURA TL TYPE S CAR IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND UNSTABLE CAR ON SNOW. I PURCHASED A \"CERTIFIED USED\" 2007 ACURA TL TYPE S CAR FOR $28,899 FROM COURTESY ACURA OF LITTLETON, CO ON MAR 12, 2010. THE ACURA TL EXPERIENCED THE 1ST SNOW ON APRIL 22, 2010. THE CAR PERFORMED EXTREMELY POOR ON SNOW AND LOST CTRL SEVERAL TIMES. THE CAR JEOPARDIZED THE SAFETY OF SCHOOL KIDS WHEN IT LOST CTRL IN THE SCHOOL PREMISES. NO OTHER CAR HAD PROBLEMS IN THAT SNOW SINCE THE SNOW WAS MELTING. I IMMEDIATELY SPOKE TO NICK VELASQUEZ (GM AT DEALERSHIP) REGARDING THE SAFETY ISSUES. NICK ASKED ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION. MS. MICHELLE, SERVICE REP, AT COURTESY ACURA TOLD ME THAT ACURA TL TYPE S IS KNOWN TO PERFORM POORLY ON SNOW DUE TO ITS DESIGN, SUSPENSION AND POWER AT FRONT WHEELS. MR. GARY, ACURA TECH TOLD ME THAT ACURA TL TYPE S IS A DANGEROUS CAR ON SNOW EVEN WITH SNOW TIRES. THIS CAUSED ME LOT OF CONCERN. NICK SAID THAT HIS EMPLOYEES NAMELY MS. MICHELLE AND MR. GARY FROM SERVICE DEPT. WERE GIVING THEIR PERSONAL OPINION ON SAFETY OF CAR. I DEMANDED REFUND OF MY MONEY BUT THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO GIVE MONEY BACK. THE ONLY OPTION THEY GAVE ME WAS TO TRADE THE CAR WITH BASIC 2007 ACURA RDX SUV AT AN ADDITIONAL COST. I ENDED PAYING $7,595 MORE THAN MARKET PRICE FOR 2007 ACURA RDX. I ALSO SPOKE TO ANOTHER OWNER AND HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT HIS CAR IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON SNOW. I FILED A WRITTEN COMPLAINT (CASE # [XXX] ) WITH ACURA CLIENT SERVICES AND ON JUNE 16, 2010 SPOKE TO MS. KATRINA (EXT 115093) FROM CLIENT SERVICES DEPARTMENT. MS. KATRINA REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE SNOW HANDLING ISSUE WITH ACURA TL TYPE S. I WOULD REQUEST NHTSA TO PERFORM SAFETY TEST ON 2007-2008 ACURA TL TYPE S ON ITS SNOW HANDLING CAPABILITIES AS THE CAR IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS.

EVERYONE STARTED HONKING AT MY BEING IN THE WAY AND I WAS ABLE WHEN PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR TO MOVE THE CAR VERY SLOWLY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  MY ELECTRONIC DASHBOARD STARTED LIGHTING UP THAT I MUST TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY.  I TURNED OFF THE AIR CONDITIONER AND FOR SOME REASON MY CAR WOULD ACCELERATOR FAST ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE 10 MILES TO THE ACURA DEALER.       THE ACURA DEALER CHECKED OUT THE PROBLEM AND SAID THEY FOUND THAT THE P2138 APP SENSOR HAD AN INTERNAL FAILURE.  THEY REPLACED THE APP SENSOR.  THE SERVICE PERSON EXPLAINED THAT THE CAR HAS A SENSOR THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE ACCELERATOR AND DID NOT RESPOND TO PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR LIKE OLDER CARS USED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE CONNECTED TO A CABLE.  I ASKED IF THIS WAS A RECALL ISSUE AND HE SAID, \"ABSOLUTELY NOT.\"  I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I NEEDED TO ACCELERATE OUT OF THE WAY OF AN ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE SENSOR FAILED.  *TR",
