According to Repair Pal:  \"What are the symptoms of a bad Air Bag Occupant Sensor? Failing occupant sensors can show one of two symptoms. They may stay on at all times, causing the passenger airbags to stay active even when a passenger is not present. Also, they may not operate at all, which prevents the airbags from activating when a passenger is seated in that seating position. Also, for most systems, the airbag or SRS warning light will illuminate on the instrument cluster, prompting the driver to service the system.",

I TOOK THE CAR TO BOTH A LAMP-ADJUSTING STATION AND A BMW DEALER WHERE I WAS TOLD THE LAMPS COULD NEITHER BE ADJUSTED NOR THEIR BULBS MERELY REPLACED BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS THE REFLECTOR BOWLS WERE DEFECTIVE AND HAD LOST THEIR ABILITY TO PROJECT LIGHT PROPERLY.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT BOTH THAT THE REFLECTOR BOWLS COULD NOT BE REPLACED INDIVIDUALLY, AND THAT BOTH (LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES) ASSEMBLIES MUST BE REPLACED AT A TOTAL COST OF MORE THAN $2000.00.  MANY POSTERS IN THE BMW FORUMS HAVE VOICED OUT EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEMS, AND I WISH THAT ALL WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT TO NHTSA.  I NEVER DROVE THIS CAR AGAIN AT NIGHT UNTIL I HAD ? IN AUGUST 2014 ?

THIS SEEMS TO BE AFFECTING BMW'S 3/5/6/ SERIES FROM AT LEAST 2004 TO 2008 FROM MY INDEPENDENT RESEARCH.  MANY PICTURES AND COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS BMW FORUMS TO DOCUMENT THIS PROBLEM.    MY PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN I LOST ONE HEADLIGHT ON MY WAY HOME IN THE DARK AND AN INDICATOR CAME ON TO IDENTIFY A FAULT IN THE HEADLIGHT.  ORIGINALLY I THOUGH IT WAS A BULB, CHANGED BULB AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION LED TO A BROKEN WIRE INSIDE OF THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY.  I FIXED THE BROKEN WIRE AND THEN NOTICED TWO MORE WIRES WHERE THE COATING ON THE WIRE SEEM TO HAVE FLAKED OFF CAUSING BARE WIRE.  I ALSO FIXED THOSE WIRES AND ALL WAS WELL.  A DAY OR TWO LATER, THE INDICATOR CAME ON AGAIN POINTING TO THE SAME HEADLIGHT.  THIS TIME THE TURN SIGNAL WAS OUT.

ABOUT 10,000 MILES INTO MY PURCHASE (OR 57,000) I BEGAN TO NOTICE MY HEADLIGHT OUTPUT DETERIORATING SIGNIFICANTLY. MY GIRLFRIEND OWNS A 2004 BMW 3 SERIES COUPE/CONVERTIBLE ALSO WITH THE OPTIONAL BI-ZENON AND 60,000 MILES. I COMPARED OUR VEHICLES HEADLIGHTS SIDE BY SIDE. MY BI-XENON HEADLIGHTS IN BOTH LOW AND HIGH BEAM FORM WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMMER AND HAD A YELLOW TINT WHEN COMPARED TO HER BI-XENON HEADLIGHTS. THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE ON BMW 3 SERIES SEDANS WITH THE OPTIONAL BI-XENON HEADLAMPS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BI-XENON REFLECTOR HOUSING BOWL IN BMW E46 3 SERIES SEDANS IS MADE FROM A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER THAN THE COUPES AND CONVERTIBLES. THE HEADLIGHTS IN MY VEHICLE ARE MADE AND CLASSIFIED UNDER THE TITLE (ZKW). THE COUPES AND CONVERTIBLES ARE MADE AND CLASSIFIED UNDER THE NAME (AL). THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT OEM ZKW HEADLIGHTS REFLECTOR HOUSING BOWLS ARE MADE FROM A TYPE OF PLASTIC. WHILE THE OEM AL HEADLIGHTS ARE MADE OUT OF METAL. THE METAL HOUSING IN AL STYLE HEADLIGHTS IN COUPES AND CONVERTIBLES ARE ABLE TO STAND UP TO THE HEAT OF THE XENON BULB, THE PLASTIC HOUSINGS IN MY SEDAN ARE NOT. DUE TO THIS IT LITERALLY GETS TOO HOT AND BURNS THE PLASTIC REFLECTIVE HOUSING TO A BROWN CRISP, WHICH IS NOT A REFLECTIVE SURFACE AND DETERIORATED MY HEADLIGHT OUTPUT TO AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE LEVEL. THE OUTPUT LEVEL HAS DIMMED SO THAT WHEN THERE IS ANY ONCOMING TRAFFIC MY LIGHTS GET DROWNED OUT AND I MUST PUT ON MY FOG LAMPS TO MAINTAIN ANY TYPE OF VISIBILITY. THE OUTPUT LEVEL IS BELOW  ANY HALOGEN LAMP I HAVE SEEN. THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE ON ALL BI-XENON EQUIPPED BMW E46 3 SERIES SEDANS. BMW IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO ADDRESS THIS DESIGN FLAW, WHICH COMPROMISES THE SAFETY OF MYSELF AND OTHERS. PICTURES OF THE ISSUE ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. THANK YOU.  *TR",

THE PATTERN OF WHERE THE REFLECTIVE MATERIAL HAS DISAPPEARED INDICATES THAT THE VAPOR DEPOSITED REFLECTIVE MATERIAL HAS FAILED DUE TO THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE HEADLIGHT BULB. OTHER HEADLIGHTS IN THE BMW 3 SERIES LINE HAVE METAL BOWLS AND DO NOT DISPLAY THE SAME PROBLEM. I'VE SPOKEN TO MY BMW DEALER AND BMW OF AMERICA AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT BUT RECEIVED NO ASSISTANCE. IF THE PROJECTOR BOWLS WERE AVAILABLE AS REPLACEMENT ITEMS I WOULDN'T BE AS UN-HAPPY UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM IT REQUIRES THE CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES AT AROUND $1200.00 PER SIDE. AS I AM AN ENGINEER BY PROFESSION I WOULD CONSIDER THIS A DESIGN DEFECT DUE TO A POOR CHOICE OF MATERIAL CAPABILITIES AND/OR MATERIAL COMPATIBILITIES. I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS OCCURS OVER TIME LEAVING THE OWNER OPERATOR WITH SLOW DETERIORATION OF LIGHT QUALITY.
