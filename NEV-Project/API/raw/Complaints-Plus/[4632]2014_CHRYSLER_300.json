The car jumped into Park while in motion which was a Safety risk to others as well as myself.  After consulting with service team, I was informed that the car had to undergo a diagnostic.  A day later I was informed that there was a fault with the electronic shift which required repaired; however, parts were not in stock at this location.  I was informed parts had to be ordered and would take approximately 2-3 weeks due to logistical issues.  On Monday, February 28, 2022, technician reported that a part was received for the upper mechanism; however, it was determined that the lower mechanism needed repair.  With this being said, these are the concerns I would like to address due to disagreement with the process.  1.  This electronic shift was previously repaired in May 2014, due to recall.  This issue could have resulted in a major safety issue.  2.  Why is a Consumer paying for a \"Repair to a Repair?\"  3.  As a Consumer with a low mileage vehicle under 59,000, why must I be responsible to pay Chrysler for a repair that is a \"Safety Issue\" and a factory recall issue.  Obviously, this is a manufacture concern created by Chrysler.  This was due to no fault of the consumer.  In closing, as a Disabled widowed Senior Citizen having the car jump into parking during my travels affected my anxiety; causing a panic attack. This repair issue is affecting my health and livelihood.  I have been without a vehicle and a means to take care of quality of life tasks.  Thank you for your time and attention to my concern.",

I WAS WITHOUT MY CAR FOR 5 DAYS, BUT THEY DID PROVIDE A RENTAL. I WAS CALLED TO DRIVE THE CAR TUESDAY WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC, AND THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE WAS STILL WOBBLY. THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY WERE GOODYEAR AND NOT MICHELIN'S (THAT'S WHAT WAS ON THE CAR ORIGINALLY). I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RIDE OF THE TIRES AND I WANTED TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE AND GET THE MICHELIN TIRES. I WAS TOLD TODAY THAT THEY (DEALERSHIP) CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY SAID NO, THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE TIRES BACK. I HAVE ONLY DRIVEN ON THE TIRES 3 TIMES, ONCE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AFTER THEY PUT THE TIRES ON. THE SECOND TIME I DROVE HOME AFTER THE SECOND BALANCING WASN'T CORRECT, AND THE THIRD TIME, BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. I FEEL THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT CHRYSLER WON'T TAKE THESE BAD TIRES BACK. THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN SELL THESE! I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TIRE WHICH INCLUDES THE SAME THING I'M COMPLAINING ABOUT, WOBBLING. I ONCE WORKED FOR CHRYSLER AND I AM ALSO GOING TO CONTACT SOMEONE AT CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS. I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE A RESPONSE TO THIS COMPLAINT! I BOUGHT THE TIRES ON APRIL 30, 2019, TOOK MY CAR BACK THE SAME DAY, TOOK IT IN ON FRIDAY, MAY 2, 2019, AND NOW PICKING IT UP TODAY, MAY 9, 2019.",

AS NO ONE AT DEALERSHIP SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE FOUND THE PROBLEM. YOU WILL SEE BY THE EMAILS I HAVE ATTACHED THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS OF PROBLEM. THEY EVEN HAVE AN OPTION TO FIX CALLED STEERING DIRECTED LIGHTING. HOWEVER I AM TOLD IT CANNOT BE PUT ON MY VEHICLE. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT THE VEHICLE IS TOTALLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE AFTER DARK IN AN AREA OUTSIDE OF CITY LIGHTS. AS YOU WILL SEE BY ATTACHED EMAILS I HAVE TRIED TO GET CHRYSLER AND THEIR DEALERSHIP TO PAY ATTENTION BUT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO EVEN TEST DRIVE THEIR OWN PRODUCT. ALSO NO ONE IN AUTHORITY FROM EITHER CHRYSLER OR THEIR DEALERSHIP HAS CONTACTED ME. ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME FROM DEALERSHIP. ANYONE THAT WOULD COME TO MY HOUSE AFTER DARK AND DRIVE MY CAR AROUND THE BLOCK WOULD SEE THAT THIS CAR IS UNSAFE. THANK YOU FOR ANY ATTENTION YOU MAY PAY TO THIS ISSUE.

SHE SCREAMED, \"NO THE CAR IS DEFINITELY MOVING!\"  THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING BACKYWARDS.  I MADE EVERY EFFORT TO MOVE THE GEARSHIFT, GRAB THE STEERING WHEEL AND HIT THE BRAKES BUT DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE LARGE CONSOLE I COULD NOT SWING MY LEG OVER TO REACH THE BRAKE.

IT WORKED AND SHIFTED NORMAL FOR ONE DAY AND AFTER THAT I CAN STEP ON THE GAS LIGHTLY AND IT SHIFTS UNCONTROLLABLY, FROM FIRST TO SECOND AND/OR HAS TROUBLE GETTING OUT OF FIRST OR SECOND GEAR AND SLAMS INTO THIRD GEAR BY A JOLT INTO EACH GEAR.
