I was hoping for a recall on this issue, but guess I'll have to take it to a repair shop at my expense. As for any warning lights.... about a month ago, the check engine light came on while we were traveling, but went away on its own by the time we got home a couple days later, so don't know if it is related or not?

THE 1ST WAS ON 12-24-15 IN WHICH A COMPLAINT WAS MADE ON THIS SITE AND IS VIEWABLE, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FEEDBACK AS OF YET. LINCOLN COVERED THE FIRST REPAIR IN WHICH THEY DISCOUNTED MY FINDINGS OF THE STEERING RECALL WHEN I PRESENTED THEM WITH IT. SO THEY DIAGNOSED IT AND CONFIRMED LOSS OF STEERING DUE TO A FAILED STEERING ANGLE MODULE SENSOR AND A SOFTWARE UPGRADE AT A COST OF $400. WELL, HERE I AM AGAIN WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM, LOSS OF STEERING GOING AROUND A CORNER ON 2-12-16. AGAIN, LUCKILY THERE WAS NOBODY AROUND AND IT HAPPENED AT NIGHT BECAUSE I ENDED UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD DOING 25-30MPH. ALSO THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE DASH STARTED TO FLASH- \"SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW\" & \"SERVICE ADVANCETRAC\". THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME PROBLEM THAT THE OTHER YEARS HAVE AND ARE LISTED BY VIN UNDER THE RECALL BUT FORD/LINCOLN REFUSES TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND IT WILL UNFORTUNATELY TAKE SOMEONE TO GET INJURED OR KILLED FOR THEM TO DO SO. THIS TIME AROUND THE DIAGNOSIS IS THE STEERING ASSEMBLY, RECALLED ON OTHER YEARS,  (CA5Z3504A) NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $2300 ORIGINALLY, REDUCED TO $2000 AFTER ARGUING WITH AND  GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH LINCOLN FOR DAYS, AND THEY WILL COVER $1500 OF THAT AND WE ARE STUCK WITH THE BALANCE. I AM FILING A SECOND COMPLAINT MORE TOWARDS THE SAFETY ISSUE THAN THE $500 WE HAVE TO PAY.

LUCKILY THERE WAS NOBODY IN THAT INTERSECTION BECAUSE I WAS CLEARLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER THIS HAPPENED AND NEARLY MISSED GOING INTO THE DITCH.

I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE AND AFTER PUTTING 50 MILES ON MY CAR WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I TOOK MY CAR BACK AND THE BRAKE PROBLEM GOT WORSE AND EVERYONE WHO RODE IN  MY CAR WOULD COMMENT ON THE NOISE MY CAR MADE AS I APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES. I TOOK IT BACK AND WAS TOLD THAT ANOTHER MODEL HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THEY WERE JUST GOING TO REPLACE THE BRAKES. AFTER A FEW DAYS THE NOISES AND MY DISCOMFORT DRIVING THE CAR BEGAN AGAIN. I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SAME CAR WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM, THAT LINCOLN HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REMEDY. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM, I HOPE THAT NONE OF US ARE HURT DUE TO WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS. *TR",
