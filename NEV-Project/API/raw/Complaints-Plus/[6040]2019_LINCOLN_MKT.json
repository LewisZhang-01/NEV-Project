        "summary": "Rear toe-link failure, and part is available.  The failure occurred while I was driving, about 20 mph, heard a loud noise from the back of the vehicle. The vehicle swerved a bit but managed to regain control and come to a complete stop. Was not diagnosed by the dealership, but have determined,through TSB lookup, that this component has been a failure point across various Ford models including the MKT. No sensor warnings on the dashboard or messages, but was hearing intermittent clunking noises coming from rear of vehicle for about 2 weeks before incident. Usually heard it when rolling over bumps.",
