I talked with my service advisor at Dave Mungenast Honda in St. Louis, MO within the first month of taking delivery of this new vehicle about this issue and was told that nothing is saved (in vehicle memory/hard drive or other) so they would not be able to diagnose unless it had just happened prior to driving in for service.  I said it was dangerous but no one was concerned (I told my kids about this and don't let them drive this car, I bought a 2022 Honda Civic also with Honda Sensing safety system (with auto braking etc.) and no issues with this car, after 8000 miles, zero issues like the 2018 Accord, none.) They said its likely just their Honda Sensing auto/safety braking system activated and its not perfect.  They said if I'm still concerned and when or if it happens again feel free to drive directly to their service department (not practical, since they are not open 24/7 and often not possible to disrupt daily routine.  It has happened at least 10+ times since the initial scary episode and I only have about 23,000 miles on this car (with little driving last two years during pandemic).    I have had it happen in exactly the same spot 2-3 times.  Whenever this happens, it's always the same, the dashboard lights up saying \"BRAKE\" while the vehicle simultaneously/suddenly applys the brakes, fairly hard.  The brakes have never locked up completely but the auto braking is a sudden unexpected moderate to hard brake, only lasting a second or two, and then the braking automatically releases.  I'm officially reporting this now, even though my events are not as recent, because I just learned other are experiencing the same issue and I believe this should be addressed by Honda and corrected before someone is injured or killed in a rear end collision.",

Unfortunately, in my research online I haven't seen anything from Honda regarding this issue. I have not addressed this issue with the Honda dealer as per my research online from reports from other people with the same issue, the dealer doesn't do anything about the issue, therefore I haven't bothered taking the vehicle into the dealer.

Why would Honda/NHTSA  not want to include the few other hundred that may be present to prevent accidents and uphold the Honda reputation of quality?",

The condition was dry and the outside temperature was around 60 degrees. I was merging onto the interstate in sport mode when all-of-the-sudden my car went into a limp mode. The check engine light began flashing and car lost 90% of its power. The engine made a knocking noise and began to shudder violently. I tried to switch it out of sport mode to get it back into Eco but the message displayed on the dash said something like \"Unavailable at this time.\" I was about a mile and a half away from work and was able to creep along the road to make it there as it was losing more and more power. When I got to work (with the engine still running) I lifted the hood and the engine was still shaking hard. I scheduled an appointment with the local dealership to have it looked at that afternoon at 2:00 pm. When I drove it to the dealership 3 miles away, the check engine light was no longer flashing and the engine seemed to run fine. When I called the service advisor later that afternoon to check the status of my car he told me, \"The technician drove the car around with the scan tool plugged into it and it drove fine. He wasn't able to pull any codes from the PCM.\" I find it to be odd. In my experience, whenever the CEL illuminates, a malfunction code will be stored in the PCM until it is cleared. Why would Honda program the PCM to reset and hide the malfunction code so that we're not able to diagnose the issue? I did take the car into the dealership earlier this year to get a warranty battery replacement and to perform 2 recalls (one was an emission recall and the other was for the BCM).",

Approximately 1 year after leasing I began to notice the paint chipping off in the roof gutter rails in a few spots near the rear window. The paint chipping has begun to progressively worse and I notified the Honda dealership in Signal Hill, CA during a service visit. They gave me information to take it to their preferred body shop to fix and informed me that there have been a few problems with Accords paint peeling from 2018. I have gotten an estimate and am awaiting a response from Honda on whether they will cover the repair which is estimated at $1600 as they will have to strip the entire roof to fix. I would like this noted as this is a manufacturing defect. I live in Southern California and the car is inside when parked.",

It jarred my body and later in the evening my neck started to tighten up so I must have incurred whiplash.  I looked on line and saw that there has been a class action case filed in 2019 about Honda\u2019s ASBS engaging with no other vehicle around citing several other instances similar of what happened to me yesterday.  When I went to unload my groceries that I had just purchased and placed in the cargo netting in the cars trunk, the force of the hard stop was so great that it pulled the clip that was holding the cargo netting out. I\u2019ll attach a couple of pictures (clip that popped out is circled in red.) I\u2019ve not contacted my doctor yet about the whiplash.  Started putting cold and hot on my neck and taking Aleve.

Called dealer and they said to bring it in, there was nothing they could advise over the phone.  Had the car towed to the dealer.  Once there, first thing I was asked was whether the person who towed the car had attempted to jump start it.  He had not.   Service person said problem source was probably the battery which they said was drained, claimed there were electrical systems in the car that could drain the battery when the car was off, something I had never heard of before and I am still skeptical about.    Car remained at dealer for a day and a half running diagnostics, etc. and they could find nothing wrong, even the battery, once recharged, was deemed good.  Wife is now worried about driving the car and what might happen if the brake system failed.  After researching 2018 Honda Accord electrical system problems online, I no longer have confidence in the vehicle's safety/reliability.  Too many reports with no problem source determination nor resolution which is the category I'm sure this one is going to be added to.",

Luckily, no one was immediately around me at the time because the sudden braking resulted in my car sliding into the lane to the right of me, towards the cars in the next lane over.  It spun to where I was facing the oncoming traffic and sliding toward the dividing wall with the passenger side to the wall. I missed the wall, but the car did a complete circle and came to a stop straddling the fast lane and facing the wall. I was able to pull the car off to the shoulder next to the wall. I did not hit anybody or anything. When I calmed down, I took the car straight to dealer to have the brakes checked. They kept the car overnight.  That night I went online and found others had reported similar incidents of the Automatic Emergency Braking System engaging unnecessarily on its own and realized that was what had happened to me. I also had a previous incident where system braked harder than necessary. The next day the service techs had found nothing wrong with the brakes. When I told the service manager about the AEBS problems I had read about, I told him I wanted it disconnected. He told me they could not do that and until Honda came up with a fix for the problem, they couldn't do anything.  I looked online again and discovered Honda had replied to questions about the AEBS engaging when it should not and said they had addressed the problem in the owner's manual.  I found an online manual and found that I can turn the Collision Mitigation Braking System off.   It resets automatically so I have to turn it off each time I start the car.  I have not driven the car any distance yet since I have not returned to work yet but plan on turning it off and see if it really does turn it off and corrects the problem.  Currently, I have no confidence in the car and am afraid of it happening again.",

I never had a car with this problem and I have had Honda's my whole life and never had this problem. I don't know if its because of the new electronic braking system but it sucks. This will be my last time buying a Honda due to this horrible braking problem. Every time I notify Honda service they tell me that's how the braking system is. Well its HORRIBLE.

HOWEVER, AFTER THEY CHECKED THE INTERNAL CAR MICROPHONES WERE OK (PER A HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN TEST, ...SO HONDA AMERICA KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM), THEY STOPPED WORK AND TOLD ME HONDA CORPORATE WON'T LET THEM REPLACE THE ANC, BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE TECHNICIAN'S AUDIO RECORDING OF THE PROBLEM IN MY CAR WASN'T SUFFICIENTLY ADEQUATE.       NOTE: I FIND THIS PROBLEM IS REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED ON THE VARIOUS 2018-20 HONDA ACCORD HYBRID FORUMS WITH MANY FRUSTRATED OWNERS.      LIKE MANY ON THE FORUMS, I ASKED (AND PAID FOR) THE HONDA TECHNICIAN TO DISCONNECT THE ANC.       WHILE THE LOW SPEED ROAD NOISE IS MUCH HIGHER, THE ROAR, HOWLING AND OBNOXIOUS BOOM IS GONE.

IT WAS FIRST NOTICED IN NOVEMBER OF 2019 WHEN THE CAR HAD ROUGHLY 18,000 MILES.  THE VEHICLE WAS LEASED TO ME AS A NEW VEHICLE, AND I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SPENT APPRECIABLE TIME DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.    WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF 55+ MPH IN COLD WEATHER, IT REQUIRES HIGHER THAN NORMAL EFFORT TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL FROM ITS ON-CENTER POSITION (SUCH AS TO MAKE MINOR CORRECTIONS TO MAINTAIN LANE POSITION).    IF ENOUGH EFFORT IS EXERTED, THE STEERING WHEEL BREAKS FREE AND THEN ALLOWS THE CAR TO BE STEERED WITH NORMAL EFFORT UNTIL THE WHEEL AGAIN REMAINS ON-CENTER FOR A FEW SECONDS, AT WHICH POINT IT BECOMES \"STICKY\" AGAIN, REQUIRING HIGH EFFORT TO MOVE.    AT THIS POINT IT ONLY OCCURS AT THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, BUT MY CONCERN IS THIS COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE SHOULD THE EFFORT BECOME ANY HIGHER, REQUIRING SUCH FORCE TO MOVE THE WHEEL THAT THE RESULT WILL BE TO SWERVE OUT OF ONE'S LANE WHEN IT BREAKS FREE, OR EVEN LOCKING ON CENTER ALTOGETHER, MAKING THE CAR UNCONTROLLABLE BY THE DRIVER.

AN ISSUE WITH THE STEERING RACK) BECAUSE TURNING THE IGNITION OFF RETURNS THE STEERING TO NORMAL EFFORT AND THE \"STICKING\" IS RESOLVED.    IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL NHTSA COMPLAINTS I HAVE FOUND IN INTERNET SEARCHES THAT DESCRIBE PRECISELY THE SAME ISSUE.    I HAVE REPORTED IT TODAY, 7/23/2020, TO THE DEALER FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE CAR - TOM KADLEC HONDA IN ROCHESTER, MN - AS I WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BEFORE COLD TEMPERATURES RETURN.",

THEY AND THE ROADSIDE SERVICE MAN ADVISED ME THAT OIL HAD EXPLODED EVERYWHERE, AS FROM A HIGH PRESSURE SITUATION. THE CAR HAS HAD ONE OIL CHANGE AT THE DEALER, PER ITS MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE, AND OTHERWISE HAS HAD NOTHING  DONE. I DID HEAR A STRANGE NOISE COMING FROM IT THE PREVIOUS EVENING--LOUD ENOUGH THAT I CHECKED TO SEE IF IT HAD ANY MAINTENANCE WARNINGS, WHICH IT DID NOT. IT SAID MY OIL WAS AT 60% AND WOULD NEED A B1 WHEN IT WAS TIME. AFTER MY CAR DIED, IT REQUIRED A TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALER SAID THEY COULD NOT EVEN TURN IT ON AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG, BUT THEY NEED A SPECIALIST TO COME LOOK AT IT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW UTTERLY DANGEROUS THE SITUATION WAS. IF IT HAD BEEN LATER IN THE DAY WITH HEAVIER TRAFFIC, MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT EVEN GREATER RISK. IT SEEMS REALLY UNUSUAL TO HAVE SUCH A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE FOR NO REASON ON A NEW, HISTORICALLY RELIABLE VEHICLE.",

I WILL DO THIS, BUT AM AFRAID THEY WILL BE KEEPING THE CAR FOR AWHILE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS OUT OF THE BLUE. IT'S HAPPENED TWICE IN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS. I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR FOUR MONTHS. ANOTHER PROBLEM..PAINT IS SPOTTING ON CAR LIKE IT WAS HIT WITH ACID. HAD PROTECTIVE WAX PUT ON THE WEEK I PURCHASED IT. VEHICLE HAS 3500 MILES ON IT. PAINT ALSO SHOWS TONS OF ORANGE PEEL. I PAID A LOT FOR THIS MODEL. EXPECTED MORE.",

THE DEALER FURTHER TOLD ME THAT THE BECAUSE I DRIVE SHORT TRIPS AND THE WEATHER HAS BEEN COLD THAT IS WHY GASOLINE IS GOING INTO THE OIL AND GIVING ME ENGINE TROUBLE ON MY NEW CAR.  MY HONDA DEALER IN ROCHESTER, NY CONFIRMED THE SAME AND SAID TO DRIVE MY CAR A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO HELP AVOID THIS  ISSUE.

AFTER RESTART SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW AND IT FORCES YOU TO ACCEPT LEGAL DECLAIMER WHILE YOU DRIVING! TWO TIMES IT JUST FROZE WITHOUT RESTART AND I HAD TO STOP THE CAR, TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND ON AGAIN, TO REMOVE THE PROBLEM. VERY ANNOYING AND ALSO NOT SAFE BECAUSE IT DISTRACTS YOU. ONE TIME IT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS BACKING UP USING REAR VIEW CAMERA, WHICH ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.    THIS HAPPENS RANDOMLY, MAINLY WHEN I'M DRIVING. IT HAPPENS WHEN DEVICES ARE ATTACHED TO THE MULTIMEDIA UNIT AND WITHOUT ANY DEVICES BEING ATTACHED OR USED. IT HAPPENS AT NIGHT AND DAY TIME AND I DOUBT IT IS RELATED TO OVERHEATING.

THANKFUL NO ONE HIT US OR US HITTING THEM. TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER OVER 2 WEEKS AGO AND AND THEY ARE TRYING TO REPLICATE IT ONCE AGAIN. NOW THE CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE DUE TO THE FACT THE BRAKES ANGAGED ON THE FREEWAY AT 55 MPH. WE REFUSE TO DRIVE IT. THE DEALER CALLED US TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE THEY INSTALLED A RECORDING DEVICE WHEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO US TO SUBJECT ANYONE TO A POSSIBLE ACCIDENT. WE UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TRYING TO REPLICATE IT BUT SOMEONE COULD BE HURT OR KILLED. WE ARE IN LIMBO AND ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED.",
