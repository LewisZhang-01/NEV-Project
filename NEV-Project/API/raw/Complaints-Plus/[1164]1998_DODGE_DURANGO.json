TOOK IT TO A DODGE DEALER BECAUSE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY (31,418 MILES). THEY DROPPED THE TRANSMISSION PAN AND PRONOUNCED IT DOA (PAN WAS FULL OF METAL SHAVINGS). SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE WRITING ON THE WALL BUT I LOVED THIS VEHICLE. TOOK IT TO AN INSPECTION STATION FOR SAFETY & EMISSIONS TESTS IN MAY OF 2006. IT FAILED FOR BAD BALL JOINTS. I ASKED THE MANAGER WHY HIS MECHANICS SEEMED TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FRONT END DURING INSPECTION AND HIS REPLY WAS IT WAS VERY COMMON TO FIND BAD BALL JOINTS ON APPROX. 50% OF ALL 1998-2000 DURANGOS. HAD MY MECHANIC REPLACE UPPER & LOWER BALL JOINTS, BOTH SIDES, AT 74,064 MILES, TO THE TUNE OF $701 PLUS TAX. I THEN STARTED HEARING ABOUT OTHER DURANGO OWNERS WITH SIMILAR BALL JOINT WOES. I WENT ONLINE AND STARTED RESEARCHING. FOUND A SITE WHERE FOLKS LIKE MYSELF WITH THE SAME BALL JOINT PROBLEMS, SOME WITH ACCIDENTS, WERE TRYING TO GET NHTSA TO DO SOMETHING. I GUESS PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DIE FIRST BEFORE NHTSA WILL STEP IN AND TELL AN AUTO MANUFACTURER THEY NEED TO FIX THEIR FAULTY PRODUCTS. I ALSO LEARNED THAT THE 1998-2000 DURANGOS WERE BUILT ON THE DODGE DAKOTA PICKUP CHASSIS. A DAKOTA WEIGHS ABOUT 4,600 LBS. WHILE A DURANGO 4X4 WEIGHS IN AT 6,400 LBS. IT'S NO WONDER THE 1998-2000 DURANGO FRONT-ENDS WERE FALLING APART. SERIOUSLY, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT ENGINEERS DOES DODGE HAVE WORKING FOR THEM. SOMETIME LATER I HEARD THAT DODGE RUSHED THE DURANGO INTO PRODUCTION IN 1998 TO COMPETE FOR THE SUV MARKET BUCKS AND DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ENGINEER A NEW CHASSIS SO THEY JUST MODIFIED THE DAKOTA CHASSIS WITHOUT BEEFING IT UP. WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT BALL JOINTS AND SUCH, THEY BUILT A WHOLE NEW CHASSIS FOR DURANGOS IN 2001.

I TOO K THE VEHICLE TO BRAUNING AUTOMOTIVE AND THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM AND GAVE AN ESTIMATE OF $1500.00 IN REPAIR COSTS. I PURCHASED THE PARTS MYSELF AND MY FATHER REPLACED BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS THE FOLLOWING DAY. ( I AM DOUBTFUL HE STILL HAS THE OLD PARTS - BUT I WILL ASK) THIS WAS BACK IN APRIL 2004 AND I AM HEARING THE CLICKING YET AGAIN. WHEN MY FATHER WORKED ON MY CAR HE TOLD ME THERE WAS A BOLT THAT WAS PARTIAL SCREWED IN AND THE THEADS HAD ACTUALLY BEEN STRIPPED OFF. HE HAD TO CHANGE THE BOLT AS WELL. THE CLICKING SOUND IS ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE TWO PIECES OF METAL ARE SLAMMING TOGETHER. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN WHEN I AM DRIVING STAIGHT . I ONLY HEAR IT WHEN I TURN. I HAVE 3 CHILDREN AND DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM. I HEARD ON THE RADIO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. I DON;T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ACTUAL RECALL OR IF IT MAY BECOME A RECALL.

ONE VEHICLE THE ABS SENSORS FAILED, AND THEN WITHIN 90 DAYS THE ABS MODULE FAILED CASUING ERRATIC DRIVING BEHAVIOR. THE MODULE WAS REPLACE AT 93K MILES. THE UNIT HAS 150K ON IT CURRENTLY WITH NO MORE ABS PROBLEMS. THE SECOND DURANGO WITH 63K MILES JUST EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. ABS FAILURE THAT CAUSED THE UNIT TO SWAY AND DRIVE IRRATICALLY ESPECIALLY ON TURNS AND WHEN BRAKING. A 5 STAR RATED DODGE DEALER  IN THE DC AREA REPLACED THE ABS MODULE AND ACTUATOR (SP) TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. IN BOTH INSTANCES THE CARS WERE VERY UNSTABLE TO DRIVE. ABS MODULE REPAIR TO UNIT ONE WAS @$650, THE OTHER DURANGO ABS REPAIRS WERE $1450. CONTACTED DAIMLER-CHRYSLER TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY TSBS ON THIS PROBLEM THEY SAID SORRY, AND THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFTEY RELATED REPAIRS BEYOND THE ORINGINAL WARRANTY PERIOD, AND UNWILLING TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM. I FIND IT VERY ALARMING THAT 2 TRUCKS BUILT WITH IN MONTHS OF EACH OTHER, WITH IDENTICAL MECHANICAL SPECS EXPERIENCE THE SAME SAFTEY RELATED PROBLEM. I ALSO OWN A 2001 DURANGO, AND A 2002 DODGE RAM 1500 AND BOTH OF THESE UNITS WERE ORDERED WITH THE UPGRADE 4-WHEEL ABS BRAKES. MY CONCERN, IS THERE A DESIGN FLAW IN THIS SYSTEM THAT COULD CAUSE HARM TO MY FAMILY IN THESE NEW MODEL TRUCKS, OR IS THIS A COVERED UP PROBLEM ON THE 1998 MODELS. BOTH 1998'S HAD DIFFERENT DRIVERS, MY FATHER (82)AND MY OLDEST SON (34 YRS) HAVE BEEN PRIMARY DRIVERS ON THE 63K MILE DURANGO, AND MY SELF AND SPOUSE (50) THE PRIMARY ON THE OTHER UNIT. BOTH UNITS HAVE FULL SERVICE  HISTORIES AT 5 STARR RATED DODGE DEALERS...PLEASE ADVISE...REMEBER YOU GUYS SAID THE ABS WAS THE SAFEST WAY TO PROTECT MY FAMILY FROM HARM......",

THERE IS NO WAY THAT A TRANSMISSION SHOULD GO OUT THAT QUICKLY. I HAVE NEVER USED THIS VEHICLE TO TOW ANYTHING AND IT HAS JUST BEEN USED TO GO BACK AND FORTH TO WORK AND OTHER NORMAL FAMILY ERRANDS. I HAVE NEVER TAKEN IT OFF ROAD AND THEREFORE I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS TRANSMISSION UIS ACTING SO FLAKY. I AM ALSO NOW GETTING SOME VERY WIERD GRINDING NOISES WHEN I BACK UP...THIS IS A NEW SOUND AND WILL BE HAVING THIS LOOKED AT NEXT. IT SEEMS AS IF THIS CAR IS JUST DETERIORATING TOO QUICKLY. AFTER ALL I AM NOT EVEN AT 100K YET...ANY HELP OR SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE GREATLY GREATLY APPRECIATED.*AK",

WE BEGAN TO NOTICE A SIGNIFICANT PULSING IN THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE DEALER ATTRIBUTED THIS TO ABS BRAKES.  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER WHEN THE PULSING WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER AND THE BRAKING WAS BEING AFFECTED, AN INDEPENDENT SHOP REVIEWED THE BRAKES AND INDICATED THAT THE ROTORS WERE SEVERELY WARPED AND CAUSING THE PULSING SENSATION.  THIS WAS REPAIRED OUT OF POCKET.  IN FEBRUARY, 2001 THE TEMPERATURE BEGAN FLUCTUATING, SPIKING HIGHER TEMPERATURES CAUSING THE CHECK GAUGE LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.  IT WOULD THEN RESET.  HANOVER DODGE, A DIFFERENT DEALER INDICATED THAT THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING SEAL WAS LEAKING AND REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT AND GASKET. THIS WAS PAID OUT OF POCKET.  APPROXIMATELY TEN DAYS LATER, THE RADIATOR HAD A MAJOR FAILURE REQUIRING REPLACEMENT.  THIS WAS PAID OUT OF POCKET IN THE AMOUNT OF $610.33. IN MAY, 2001WE WERE ALERTED TO A PROBLEM INVOLVING THE FRONT END.  IN BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, A LEAK WAS NOTICED FROM THE TRANSMISSION COOLER AND ALSO AND MORE CRITICALLY IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEFT UPPER BALL JOINT REQUIRED REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS THE INNER TIE RODS.  THESE REPAIRS WERE ALSO PAID OUT OF POCKET IN THE AMOUNT OF $923.45.  THE LATEST ISSUE AROSE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WHEN A HOWLING SOUND WAS NOTICED COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  THROUGH RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT EVALUATION IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAS A DESIGN DEFECT WHEREBY THE RING AND PINION CANNOT HANDLE THE LOAD OF THE VEHICLE.

THE DOOR BROKE BECAUSE SOME STICKY-BACK FOAM GOT UNSTUCK AND STUCK TO SOMETHING ELSE PUTTING THE DOOR UNDER STRAIN AND FINALLY BREAKING IT. THE FOAM, I BELIEVE, WAS TO KEEP DOWN THE NOISE OF THE DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING. ANYWAY, WHEN THAT PART IN QUESTION WAS ORDERED, PART #21, A DOOR WAS SENT BUT IT WASN'T THE CORRECT DOOR. AFTER INTENSE INVESTIGATION BY THE LOCAL DODGE DEALER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MANUFACTURER COULD NOT PRODUCE THE CORRECT DOOR BECAUSE THE NUMBERS IN THEIR SYSTEM DIDN'T MATCH THE NUMBERS ON THE DOOR. I HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS WRITTEN DOWN, UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT WITH ME. I CAN PRODUCE THEM IF NEEDED. WHEN INQUIRING WITH OTHER DEALERS ABOUT THE DOOR, WE FOUND THEY ALSO HAD RUN INTO THE PROBLEM AND HAD NO SOLUTION FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AS WELL. WE FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A NATION-WIDE PROBLEM AND THOSE DEALERS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE PART ON THEIR PREMISES WILL NOT GIVE THEM UP FOR FEAR OF NEEDING THEM FOR THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS.

I FEEL THAT AFTER ONLY 53,000 MILES ON THE CAR THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE SHOULD NOT BE EXPERIENCED. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE UNIT WHERE THE UNIVERSAL JOINT IS, CANNOT BE GREASED BECAUSE IT IS A SEALED UNIT. I BELIEVE THIS IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE.

THIS STOPPED THE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE SKID, BUT THREW ME BACK INTO THE BARRICADE - HITTING THE ENTIRE DRIVER SIDE AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE REAR WHEEL.

I DID NOT NOTICE THE CRACK RIGHT AWAY, AND WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE HOME.  THE \"LOW FUEL WARNING LIGHT\" CAME ON AND I STOPPED FOR GAS.  IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I NOTICED THAT THE FUEL WAS RUNNING OUT ON THE GROUND.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DODGE DEALER FOR REPAIR, AND PERHAPS INVESTIGATION INTO THE FAULTY PLACEMENT OF THE SPRINGS.  THEY HAVE IGNORED THE SITUATION AND GAVE ME THE 800 NUMBER FOR CHRYSLER CUSTOMER RELATIONS.  WHEN I CALLED THEM, I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND RECEIVED BASICALLY A \"SO WHAT ??\" ATTITUDE.  I AM A PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AGENT AND WOULD NOT WANT ANY OF MY INSURANCE CARRIERS TO NEEDLESSLY PAY CLAIMS FOR FAULTY DESIGN.
