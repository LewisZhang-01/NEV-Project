I called just before closing and they hadn't gotten to it and they advised me to come get my vehicle and reschedule everything when I could secure another day off work.

        "summary": "Hello, my name is Jamie Woodley. I'm filing this complaint on my 2006 Jeep Liberty Sport. Currently, there's a recall for the Suspension Rear lower control arms. I've read the previous recalls on it, which I saw this vehicle has been reprogrammed before. I've only had the vehicle for a few months and I've had an oil leak, bad thermostat, and the transmission is busted. I can't reverse or drive over 10 mph. I heard the transmission may be in Fail Safe mode. I had Midas do a full inspection, but they failed to acknowledge the lower control arms by suggesting brakes. I knew it wasn't the brakes. The technician drove the vehicle after the brakes were done, but I still heard/felt a problem with the Suspension. There is a recall for that from 2018. I purchased the vehicle last year in March 2020. Also, the rear lift gate was dented when I bought it like the vehicle may have been in an accident. This was a vehicle I purchased for my 2 kids and I. This vehicle has been giving me problems since I bought it. The back driver's side window won't go all the way up. I have to keep a stick in between just to keep the window from falling all the way in the door. Definitely not a safe vehicle. My Engine stalled out on the free way while I was on my way to pick up my kids. After my oil change, no oil light came on. I am seeking help with any buy back programs or a valued trade in appraisal. I have a quote from Conrad's on how much it's going to cost to fix it and the price is over $3,000. I have extended warranty, but am unsure if it will cover any service requests. That is pretty outrageous that it's going to cost that much to fix it.  I've been at Take 5  to keep up on the maintenance and was told I had an oil leak somewhere. On top of the brakes, I've spent money on 4 new tires, 6 ignition coils, an O2 Sensor, and I bought a New PCM/ECU computer I have yet to have installed. Feel free to contact me at the information I've provided. I'd be truly grateful for any assistance. Thanks!",

TURNING RIGHT AND ELEVATING SLIGHTLY TO ENTER MY COMPLEX, I HEARD A LOUD GRINDING NOISE AND FELT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE LOWER.

I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED, PLACED THE CAR IN PARK, AND THEN GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO INSPECT.   I COULD SEE THAT THE WHEEL WAS FOLDED INWARD TOWARDS THE VEHICLE. LOOKING UNDER THE CAR I COULD ALSO SEE THE LOWER CONTROL ARM NOW RESTING ON THE GROUND ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I HAD ZERO IDEA WHAT COULD'VE CAUSED THIS BUT WAS EXTREMELY THANKFUL IT HAD NOT OCCURRED WHILE I WAS TRAVELING IN EXCESS OF 80 MPH ON THE HWY WITH MY SON IN THE BACK SEAT. THE VEHICLE WAS STILL ON THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE BACK ENTRANCE TO MY APT COMPLEX AND A PASSERBY STOPPED TO SEE IF HE COULD HELP. HE RECOGNIZED THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THAT MY PASSENGER WHEEL HAD SEPARATED FROM THE BALL JOINT. HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD SEEN THIS HAPPEN TO NUMBER OF OTHER VEHICLES.

THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE BACKING PLATES HAD CORRODED AND RUSTED TO SUCH A SEVERE DEGREE THE CAR WAS INOPERABLE WITHOUT EXPENSIVE REPAIRS (557.97 EACH TIME).THE CLOSE TIMING OF THESE  INCIDENTS SHOW THAT THE LIFESPAN OF THESE PARTS WERE NOT MADE TO LAST. JEEP DECLINED THE REQUEST TO REIMBURSE EXPENSES PAID, AND FAILED TO ADDRESS THE BIGGER SAFETY CONCERN. I WORRY SOMEONE WILL NOT BE AS LUCKY WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN A VEHICLE <10 YRS OLD USED SOLELY AS A PASSENGER VEHICLE, IS MADE OF SUCH POOR QUALITY PARTS THAT THEY LITERALLY RUST OFF THE VEHICLE WHILE IT IS IN TRANSIT.  IN DOING RESEARCH ON THE EXTENT OF THESE BACKING PLATE ISSUES, I SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT  CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS FROM A QUALITY, FINANCIAL, AND SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, YET I SEE THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO RECTIFY THIS ISSUE. IT IS MY VIEW THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS QUALITY ISSUE BEFORE I ALMOST HAD ACCIDENTS TWICE WITHIN A 3 WEEK PERIOD. THIS MAKE AND MODEL HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL CONSUMER SAFETY RECALLS, I AM SURPRISED THAT THIS HAS BACKING PLATE ISSUE HAS  NOT BEEN BROUGHT TO ATTENTION OF OWNERS SO THAT IT COULD BE RESOLVED IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER AT THE COST OF JEEP CORP. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THEIR COMPANY WAS AWARE OF AND PARTS SHOULD NOT ?ROT? OFF QUALITY VEHICLES. JEEP RESPONDED ON 9-29-15 AND FAILED TO MENTION THE SAFETY ISSUE RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM.

AFTER BEING LEFT AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR 4.5 HOURS, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE RECALL REPAIR COULD NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE BOLTS.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MANAGER, BRAD THAT MORE THAN ONE TECHNICIAN LOOK AT THE CAR AND DETERMINED IT COULD NOT BE REPAIRED.  I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP IN DESPAIR  WITH MAJOR CONCERN BECAUSE THE RECALL INVOLVES A CHANCE OF THE JEEP FUEL TANK LEAKING DURING A REAR END COLLISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN A FIRE.  NOW  AS A MOTHER AND WIFE I CANNOT IMAGINE CONTINUING TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE KNOWING THE AT ANY GIVEN TIME I COULD LOSE MY CAR AND POSSIBLY THE LIFE OF ME AND MY FAMILY.  PLEASE HELP ME BY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF  HOW CHRYSLER PLAN TO HANDLE THIS RECALL.

THE WAY THE DEALERSHIP \"FIXES\" THIS RECALL IS TO INSTALL A TRAILER HITCH, WHICH IS LAUGHABLE, AT BEST. THE TESTING AGENCIES HAVE PROVEN THAT A TRAILER HITCH IS ONLY MINIMALLY EFFECT UP TO 25 MPH AND NOT EFFECTIVE AT GREATER SPEEDS. I REQUESTED THE DEALERSHIP \"WORK WITH ME\" SO THAT I COULD BUY A SAFER VEHICLE FROM THEM. THEY ARE ONLY WILLING TO OFFER ME THE SAME TRADE-IN AMOUNT AS IF I WERE TRADING VEHICLE SOLELY BECAUSE I WANT A NEW VEHICLE. I WOULD KEEP THIS VEHICLE, IF IT WERE SAFE. I'VE CONTACTED METAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES AND REQUESTED THAT THEY BUILD ME A SAFE, STRONG GAS TANK AND BUMPER TO REPLACE THAT WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE VEHICLE. I AM WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE TO MAKE THIS VEHICLE SAFE. THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HAVE REFUSED TO BUILD ANY PARTS FOR ME BECAUSE THE LIABILITY, AFTER AN ACCIDENT, WOULD REVERT TO THEM RATHER THAN THE BURDEN BEING ON JEEP. I HAVE TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT I HAVE A SAFETY PROBLEM BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO THINK I SHOULD GET ANY FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION WHEN TRADING IN AN UNSAFE VEHICLE THAT CAN NOT BE MADE SAFE EITHER BY ME OR BY JEEP. THEY WILL ONLY OFFER ME LESS THAN KELLY BLUE BOOK FOR TRADE IN AND HAVE TAKEN $1,000.00 OF THE RETAIL PRICE OF THE NEW VEHICLE.

I TOOK THE JEEP TO MY LOCAL GARAGE IN WHICH TIME THEY TORE THE DASH APART AND FOUND IT HAD IN FACT \"BLEW UP\". IT NOW ONLY RUNS ON ONE SPEED (HIGH). DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS (WINTER) EVERY TIME I RUN MY HEATER WITH THE FAN OR THE DEFROST MY DASH BOARD GOES HAYWIRE. MEANING GAUGES SHUT DOWN, ALL ALERT LIGHTS GO ON AND/OR FLASH AND ALL BEEPS, BUZZERS AND NOISES SOUND. IT CONTINUES UNTIL I TURN THE HEAT/DEFROST OFF. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE GARAGE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS IN WHICH THEY RAN THE SCANNER WITH 7 CODES COMING UP. AFTER A FEW HOURS OF SITTING IT WOULD JUST RESET ITSELF AND CODES WOULD DISAPPEAR. EVERYTIME IT RAINS NOW THE DASH BOARD DOES THE SAME THING. I HAVE HAD 2 GARAGES AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT MECHANICS LOOK AT IT AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. ON APRIL 25 I CALLED CHRYSLER TO GET MY JEEP IN FOR THE N46 RECALL AND ASKED ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL ISSUE AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. I TOLD HER IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM IN THE JEEP LIBERTYS. HER RESPONSE TO ME WAS \"IN THE LAST 25 YRS I'VE WORKED HERE, I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM.\" SO I SAID I'D LIKE IT LOOKED AT WHILE ITS THERE FOR THE RECALL ISSUE. HER RESPONSE AGAIN WAS \" YOU NEED TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE GARAGE THAT LOOKED AT IT THE FIRST TIME, AND YOU DO KNOW THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE $98 AN HOUR FOR DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS.\" I WAS LOOKING OVER MY PAPER SENT IN THE MAIL TO ME ABOUT THE N46 RECALL TODAY AND FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAPER IT READS............\"ASK YOUR DEALER ABOUT THE FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION. OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT YOUR VEHICLE ALSO REQUIRES REPAIR FOR NOTIFICATION G03\" I GOOGLE SEARCHED JEEP LIBERTY 06 RECALL G03 AND FOUND.........THIS IS A BLOWER FAN ISSUE.

THE FIRST TANK FILL UP THE GAS OVERFLOWED OUT OF THE TANK.  THERE WAS NO \"STOP\" THE GAS JUST CAME OUT.  I ASKED THE CASHIER IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE GAS PUMP AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW.  SO, THE NEXT GAS FILL UP A WEEK LATER, THE GAS SHOT OUT OF THE TANK THIS TIME.   STILL NO WARNING TO STOP FILLING THE TANK WITH A GAS \"STOP\".  I CONTACTED THE DEALER, WHO COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG WITH THE TANK, AND HAD TO PAY FOR AND SEND THE CAR TO A LOCAL JEEP DEALER FOR REPAIR.  TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, THEY REPLACED THE GAS TANK.    ALBEIT I RECEIVED THE CAR BACK WITH LESS GAS THAN I HAD LEFT IT WITH.  TOOK THE CAR HOME, FILED THE CAR ON FRIDAY 11/7/14  AND THE GAS MECHANISM DID STOP THE GAS,  BUT ONLY AFTER GAS LEAKED OUT FROM THE GAS TANK AGAIN, AND THEY NEVER EVEN TESTED THE CAR TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN!   AS I FOUND OUT LATER, THEY REPLACED THE TANK WITH A USED TANK.  I AM INCREDULOUS ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  MY DEALER IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE, I HOPE.  AND IF IT IS NOT FIXABLE, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP OR CHRYSLER PRODUCT!  FROM WHAT I AM READING ON THE WEB NO ONE IS LISTENING TO US JEEP OWNERS.

TO MY KNOWLEDGE CHRYSLER CORPORATION DID NOT NOTIFY OWNERS ABOUT THE DEFECTIVE PARTS OR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I FOUND THIS INFORMATION OUT WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN FOR WINDOW REPAIR AT THE JEEP CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP (THE FARICY BOYS CHRYSLER, JEEP) ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2013.  CHRYSLER KNEW ALL THE SIDE WINDOW PARTS WERE DEFECTIVE, BUT WOULD ONLY REPLACE THE WINDOW LIFT PLATES THAT WERE NOT WORKING ON THAT DAY.      ANOTHER SIDE WINDOW LIFT PLATE ON THE SAME VEHICLE FAILED ON MAY 30, 2013.  WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND A WINDOW COMPLETELY DROPS DOWN IT CAN STARTLE THE DRIVER AND IS A DISTRACTION THAT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE WAS AGAIN TAKEN IN FOR REPAIR AT THE JEEP CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE EXTENDED WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED AND THE COST OF REPAIR NEEDED TO BE PAID BY THE OWNER.      IN SUMMARY, CHRYSLER CORPORATION KNEW THE SIDE WINDOW LIFT PLATES ARE DEFECTIVE, BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE ALL THE DEFECTIVE PARTS.  I AM ASKING THE NHTSA TO ORDER A MANDATORY RECALL AND REQUIRE CHRYSLER TO FIX ALL WINDOW LIFT PLATES ON THE JEEP LIBERTIES.  A DEFECTIVE LIFT PLATE CAN CAUSE THE WINDOW TO UNEXPECTEDLY DROP DOWN AND CAN PRESENT DRIVER CONFUSION AND A DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING.

THE REAL PROBLEM IS A WEAK LINK IN THE TRANNY,(THE TORQUE CONVERTER).  WHEN THE TORQUE CONVERTER FAILS IT DESTROYS THE TRANSMISSION..  WHICH IS WHAT  JUST HAPPENED TO ME.  MY JEEP IS 8 YEARS OLD, BUT I ONLY HAD 68,000 MILES ON IT.  THE REASON I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WAS FOR THE LONG SERVICE LIFE OF THE 2.8L DIESEL (300,000 PLUS MILES BEFORE REBUILD).  I LIVE IN A SOMEWHAT RURAL AREA AND I HAVE SPOKE WITH OVER 12 PEOPLE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS SAME PROBLEM    WITH THERE 2.8L DIESEL TRANSMISSION #545RFE.  I KNOW THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM,I HAVE GONE ONLINE AND SPOKEN WITH ALOT OF LIBERTY OWNERS AND ALL HAVE HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS,I HAVE ALSO SPOKE WITH MANY FORMER LIBERTY OWNERS WHO SAID THEY WOULD NEVER DRIVE ANOTHER JEEP, BECAUSE LACK OF DEALER CONCERNS OVER TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS..THEY HAD!  I AM CORRECTING THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING THE DAMAGED STOCK TRANSMISSION,WITH A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AFTERMARKET ONE MADE FOR THE TORQUE OF A DIESEL ENGINE..

I HAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE WESTBURY JEEP SERVICE CENTER ON JANUARY 15,2013 TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE SINCE THE GAS OVERFLOW IS A POTENTIAL HAZARD.   *TR",

CHRYSLER, AFTER INITIALLY REFUSING TO ISSUE THE RECALL, CAVED IN TO NHTSA PRESSURE. WHEN I SPOKE WITH CHRYSLER TODAY, FIVE MONTHS AFTER THEY AGREED TO THE RECALL, THEY INDICATED THAT THEY ARE WAITING ON NHTSA REVIEWS AND APPROVAL OF CHRYSLER'S RECALL PROPOSAL TO INSTALL A TRAILER HITCH IN UNDER-EQUIPPED VEHICLES, IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE REAR END OF THE VEHICLE AND PREVENT GAS TANK PUNCTURES IN THE EVENT OF A LOW-SPEED REAR-END COLLISION.    IT SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE THAT NHTSA WOULD PRESSURE A MANUFACTURER TO ISSUE A RECALL, AND THEN HOLD UP THE PROCESS OF REPAIRING AFFECTED VEHICLES WHEN THE MANUFACTURER FINALLY AGREES.

SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEAT FABRIC.  SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THIS.  THIS FLAW REDUCES THE VALUE OF MY CAR AND GIVES A BAD REPUTATION TO THE JEEP NAME, AS WELL AS UNDERPLAYS THE QUALITY THAT IS NORMALLY ASSUMED WHEN PURCHASING A JEEP VEHICLE.  THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS OCCURRING DUE TO THE MISUSE OF THE SEAT OR LACK OF TRYING TO PRESERVE THEIR INTEGRITY.  I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE THE DAY I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BRAND NEW.  IT WAS ONLY AFTER SEEING MANY OTHER OWNERS FILING WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT, I DECIDED TO SPEAK UP SO THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO TO FIX MY SEATS, I OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE EVERY CLEANING PRODUCT/ SERVICE I HAVE TRIED HAS FAILED.

WITHIN 2 MONTHS OF HAVING THIS JEEP OUR RIGHT REAR WINDOW DROPPED INTO THE DOOR AS WE WERE DRIVING TO A FAMILY FUNCTION. MY BIGGEST FEAR WAS THAT 1 OF OUR 3 KIDS COULD HAVE BEEN HURT BY BROKEN GLASS. MY FATHER REPAIRED THE WINDOW BY WEDGING A PIECE OF WOOD BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW. I LATER CALLED JEEP WHO TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS JEEP AND THAT THEY WOULD GLADLY SPLIT THE COST WITH ME WHICH ONLY COST $600 PER WINDOW AND THEY WON'T WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I LEFT IT ALONE CAUSE WE COULD NOT AFFORD THIS AT THE TIME. A FEW MONTHS LATER IN NOVEMBER 2010 THE LEFT SIDE REAR WINDOW SLIPPED,ONCE AGAIN MY FATHER REPAIRED IT AT BEST HE COULD. I FINALLY WENT ONLINE TO SEE WHAT I COULD DO REPAIR THE PROBLEM MYSELF AT A CHEAPER COST. I CAME ACROSS A WEB SITE STEIGERS.COM THE GENTLEMAN WHO OWNS THIS COMPANY HAS CREATED A REPLACEMENT PIECE FOR THE BROKEN PART AND IT WORKS GREAT. I REPLACED IT MYSELF WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF REPAIRING CARS. THE ONLY HARD PART WAS WORKING IN SUCH A TIGHT SPACE..THANK GOD MY HANDS ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE IN BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW AREA. THE PART IS ABOUT A $100 WITH SHIPPING AND HANDLING AND SO FAR SEEMS TO HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR TO DO ALL THE WORK ON 1 WINDOW. THATS NOT OUR ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS LOVELY VEHICLE WE HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SPILLING OUT WHEN FILLING THE TANK. THE TANK SEEMS TO BUILD PRESSURE OR CATCH AIR. I DON'T KNOW ALL I KNOW IS IT SCARED ME REALLY BAD THE FIRST TIME.AND WE HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE ESP ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HIT A TURN TO HARD OR HIT A BIG BUMP. HOW WONDERFUL A 4X4 VEHICLE WHO DOESN'T LIKE BIG TURNS,BUMPS OR SNOW. AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IS THE BROKEN WINDOW..THEY TOLD ME ITS CALLED A BINDING CRACK IT HAPPENS TO ALL JEEPS SO DON'T FORCE YOUR JEEP TO DO ITS JOB..AND WORK.  *TR",

TODAY, I READ ABOUT A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL HEATER ON THE LIBERTY DIESEL AND SO I CHECKED THE HEATER ON MY VEHICLE.  THE PLASTIC INSULATOR AROUND THE ELECTRICAL PINS OF THE FUEL HEATER CONNECTOR (ON CABLE) IS DISCOLORED AND PARTIALLY MELTED.    DOING FURTHER READING THIS EVENING, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN ALSO BE A SOURCE OF FUEL SEEPAGE.  ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF FUEL AROUND THE CONNECTOR, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND MAY HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR I HAVE BEEN SMELLING WHILE DRIVING.    I FEEL FORTUNATE TO HAVE DISCOVERED THIS IN A PRE-FAILURE CONDITION AND HAVE NOT (YET) EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS FUEL LEAK, ENGINE FIRE OR ENGINE STOPPAGE DUE TO FUEL SYSTEM FAILURE,  I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT YOUR AGENCY WAS AWARE OF THIS DESIGN PROBLEM BACK IN 2007 (PE07041), BUT CLOSED IT WITH APPARENTLY NO ACTION TAKEN.  IN MY OPINION, THIS CONDITION CERTAINLY WARRANTS A MANUFACTURER'S RECALL AND REPAIR.  I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE PARTIALLY BURNED CONNECTOR ON MY VEHICLE, SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM.  IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE ELECTRICAL CAPACITY OF THIS CONNECTOR IS BEING EXCEEDED AND IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW.  *TR",

I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE, BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE TO THE GAS STATION WITHOUT NOTICING THE WIND NOISE WITH THAT WINDOW DOWN. ANYWAYS, I USED THE BUTTON TO TRY AND ROLL IT UP AND IT DIDN'T MOVE. AFTER A COUPLE OF TRIES WITH THE BUTTON, AN ODD GRINDING SOUND STARTED COMING FROM THE DOOR. I GOT OUT AND WENT AROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I OPENED THE DOOR AND USED THE REAR BUTTONS TO ROLL IT UP, AND THE NOISE CONTINUED AS WELL AS SOME KIND OF PIPE/WIRE CAME OUT OF THE DOOR.  WHEN I TRIED TO GENTLY WIGGLE THE WINDOW TO SEE IF IT WAS BENT OR SOMETHING, THE PART THAT WAS STILL UP SLID INTO THE DOOR (SO THE WHOLE WINDOW IS DOWN NOW AND WON'T ROLL UP).  I LIVE IN A DORM AT A HUGE SCHOOL, SO HAVING MY WHOLE CAR EXPOSED BY THIS OPEN WINDOW MAKES ME EXTREMELY NERVOUS.  I HAVE TAPED A TRASH BAG OVER IT FOR NOW IN CASE IT RAINS, BUT IT'S AWFULLY LOUD WHEN I'M DRIVING, AND I DOUBT IT WILL LAST MUCH LONGER.

I NOW HAVE ONE WINDOW STILL DOWN - PASSENGER FRONT - AND IT IS CURRENTLY TAPED UP. HOWEVER, IN FLORIDA WEATHER, IT FREQUENTLY MELTS AND FALLS DOWN. THIS LEAVES MY CAR WINDOW DOWN AND EXPOSED IN PUBLIC WHILE I AM AT WORK - WHICH COULD LEAD TO MANY DANGERS. I AM SICK OF TAKING MY CAR IN EVERY FEW MONTHS BECAUSE JEEP CANNOT SIMPLY FIX THIS PROBLEM. I PAID A PRICE FOR MY CAR, AND COULD EASILY HAVE BOUGHT ANOTHER CAR BY NOW WITH THE MONEY I HAVE SPENT ON FIXING THE WINDOWS IN THIS CAR - AROUND 350 TO 500 A POP FOR EACH TIME.

SINCE MY PURCHASE THE REAR WINDOW REGULATORS FAIL 5 TIMES AS OF THE CURRENT DATE. 4 TIMES THE DEALERSHIP IN FL FIXED WITHOUT ANY COST TO ME. WHEN THIS HAPPENED 9/15/2010 FOR THE 5TH TIME (3RD TIME ON THE SAME WINDOW) I CALLED THE LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER :EXPLAINED  THE ISSUE & WANTED TO KNOW WHEN I COULD BRING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO BE REPAIRED. HE WENT ON TO TELL ME THIS: 'YOU CAN BRING IT IN ANYTIME, THERE IS A $100 DEDUCTIBLE TO HAVE THIS FIXED. ' ( I QUESTIONED WHY, AS THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS DEFECT ON THE  MANUFACTURER) HE RESPONDED 'THAT IS WHAT THE CHARGE IS, JUST BE GLAD THAT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOUR WINDOWS, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2002- CURRENT JEEP LIBERTY.  JEEP IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ISSUE A RECALL, NOR ARE THEY GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.' (I WAS SHOCKED THAT I WOULD BE TOLD THIS) 'IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS WELL, CALL CHRYSLER YOURSELF, HERE IS THE NUMBER 1-800-992-1997.'  AFTER I HUNG UP THE PHONE WITH HIM, I CALLED THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP IN FLORIDA TO GET THE EXACT DATES OF THE REPAIRS.   RIGHT REAR- 1/28/08  LEFT REAR- 12/20/2006,  7/8/2008, AND 8/13/09.  I DID CALL CHRYSLER AND SPOKE TO SOMEONE, RECEIVED A CASE NUMBER, AND WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE WOULD CONTACT ME IN 24-48 HOURS WITH SOME SORT OF RESOLVE TO THIS. (THAT WAS THURSDAY MORNING.)  I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CASE MANAGER AT CHRYSLER FRIDAY AROUND 9:50AM.  THERE WAS A MESSAGE LEFT TO CALL BACK, OR I COULD WAIT FOR THEM TO CALL ME BACK ON MONDAY. CALLED BACK,SPOKE 2 GRETCHEN: SAI THE CASE MANAGER HAD PUT NOTES IN THE CASE WITH THE FOLLOWING:  I HAD TO PAY THE $100 UP FRONT AND I COULD SUBMIT ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO BE REIMBURSEDASKED TO SPEAK TO THE CASE MANAGER AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO MATT (WHOM I THOUGHT WAS THE CASE MANAGER). *TR",

THIS TIME, AFTER EXPLAINING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST TIME, THE DEALER ASKED FOR $90 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, WHICH I FOUND RIDICULOUS. AFTER A VERY BRIEF INTERNET SEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM, WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE INFURIATING THAT THE DEALER WANTED ME TO PAY THEM TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THE DEALER FINALLY OFFERED TO MAKE THE REPAIR FOR $100, WHICH I DECLINED.    THIS IS A CLEAR SAFETY ISSUE, NOT TO MENTION A SECURITY ISSUE. WHEN THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION, IT CAUSES THE DRIVER TO BE DISTRACTED, WHICH CAN -- AND EVENTUALLY WILL -- LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT.

CHRYSLER AND THE GOVERNMENT REGULATORS NEED TO START TREATING THIS LIKE THE SAFETY ISSUE THAT IT IS AND ISSUE A RECALL.

I GOING ABOUT 60-65 MPH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A LOT OF SHUDDERING COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND THEN A LOUD KLUNK AND IT CAUSE A SUDDEN DROP IN MY SPEED FROM 65 TO 30 MPH. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS INJURED OR HURT, HOWEVER AS IN THE PAST WHEN THIS HAPPEN, ITS WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING A TEMPORARY LOSS OF CONTROL.  THE TRANSMISSION SHUDDER HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES WHILE II WAS TRAVELING.  MY DEALER HAS KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER A YEAR, AND I HAVE REPORTED IT TO HIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT MORE THAN 4 TIMES AND THE PROBLEM HAS YET TO BE FIXED. CHRYSLER I BELIEVE KNOWS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE JEEP LIBERTY CRD'S DRIVE TRAIN BUT HAS YET TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THIS WILL BE MY THIRD COMPLAINT TO NHTSA ON THIS.  THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNING HOME ON THE 3RD OF JAN. 2008. I WILL BE SEEING A REP ON THIS COMING MONDAY AND I DO NOT EXPECT TO GET ANY SATISFACTION FROM HIM ON THIS SAFETY MATTER.  ALSO MY REAR BRAKES ARE GROANING EVERY TIME THAT I STOP AND THE  DEALER HAS ALREADY DID A TSB ON THEM ONCE AND THE PROBLEM HAS RETURNED.  THEY TOLD ME THAT AFTER THE CAR HAS MORE THAN 12,000 MILES THEY WILL DO NOTHING. THE CAR HAS JUST 16,500.  *TR",

THE SVC MGR AT GRINDSTAFF OF ELIZABETHTON, TN  TOLD ME MY ROTORS WERE WARPED.  THERE IS NO WAY THIS SHOULD HAPPEN AT 34000 MILES.  I DRIVE 95% FOUR LANE HIGHWAY MILES TO WORK - NO RED LIGHTS AT ALL.  YOU CAN SEE BY LOOKING AT THE ROTORS THE OUTER BRAKE PADS HAVE NEVER MADE CONTACT WITH THE ROTORS.  WHEN THE OTHER SIX PADS WERE REPLACED THE OUTER REAR BRAKE PADS WERE NOT WORN ONE BIT AND THE OUTER BRAKE CONTACT SURFACE OF THE ROTOR IS NOT WORN AT ALL.    THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE BRAKE ACTUATOR SOLENOID.  MY JEEP WILL NOT COME OUT OF PARK WHEN IT GETS EXTREMELY HOT INSIDE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT RUNNING THE A/C ABOUT 10 MINS. TO COOL THE BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY OFF A LITTLE.  IT STICKS IN PARK AND WILL NOT COME OUT.  THE SAME DEALER TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM EVEN WITH IT STILL UNDER WARRANTY (REPORTED AT 33000 MILES).

SAID IT WAS DUE TO THE WAY I DRIVE AND USE THE BRAKE PEDAL. PROBLEM NOT FIXED.  JEEP HAS 10000 MILES ON IT NOW. WHEN IT ONLY HAD 1750 MILES ALL THE PANEL LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE VECHICLE SHUT DOWN, HAD TO BE TOWED TO DEALERSHIP. THEY HAD TO REPLACE CLUSTER, BCM AND PCM PER STAR LINE, REPAIR SHORT IN RADIO WIRING HARNESS, ALSO REPAIR BURN IN 02 SENSOR WIRING HARNESS, REROUTE HARNESS. AND NOW THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT, TO PICK IT UP IN THE MORNING.  *NM",
