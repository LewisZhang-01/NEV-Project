UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, HE NOTICED THAT BOTH PASSENGER AND DRIVER'S SIDE BRAKE LIGHTS WERE DIM.  THE CENTER BRAKE LIGHT WAS WORKING AS WELL AS THE TURN SIGNALS.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND THEY STATED THAT THE MULTI-FUNCTION SWITCH WAS FAILING BECAUSE IT DEVELOPED AN OPEN CIRCUIT CONDITION.  THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AT THE COST OF $565.  THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT NO COMPENSATION WOULD BE PROVIDED BECAUSE THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THE CONTACT RESEARCHED THE FAILURE AND FOUND NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 01V364000 (EXTERIOR LIGHTING:BRAKE LIGHTS:SWITCH).  HE STATED THAT IF THE MANUFACTURER INSTALLED CUT OUTS ON HIS VEHICLE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 25,000 AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 25,062.",
