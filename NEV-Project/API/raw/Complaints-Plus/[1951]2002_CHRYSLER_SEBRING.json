I will continue to pursue my options. I invested alot of blood money into the vehicle and the help I received to date is Park it or Junk it.That is not even a remote consideration.",

I NOTICED THE CAR WAS BOTTOMING OUT I TOLD THE MECHANIC JIM WHO IS ALSO THE MAN THAT SOLD ME THE CAR AND HE ASSURED ME IT WAS SAFE. THEY HAD THREE MONTHS TO CHECK THE WHOLE CAR OUT AND MAKE SURE IT WAS SAFE AND IT SAT IN THE SAME SPOT UNTIL I PICKED IT UP. NOW EITHER THEY NEVER CHECKED THE CAR OR THEY CHECKED THE CAR AND SOLD IT TO ME ANYWAY. THE WAY I SEE IT IS THEY WERE WRONG EITHER WAY. NOT TO MENTION THAT JIM THE SO-CALLED MECHANIC IS THE ONE WHO SOLD IT TO ME. RIGHT AFTER THE BATTERY DIED THE RADIO TOOK A CRAP. THEY ALSO CHARGED ME EXTRA 4 TAX TAGS AND TITLE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE $2,000 THAT THEY WANTED FOR THE CAR. I TRIED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM SEEING THAT IT WAS UNDER A MONTH THAT I ACTUALLY HAD THE CAR IN MY POSSESSION I EXPLAINED TO JIM WHAT THE POLICE TOLD ME ABOUT BEING ALL RUSTED BUT THEY INSISTED I HAD THE CAR TOO LONG AND THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO HERE WE ARE. I HAVE A PERSONAL INJURY CASE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, I WAS TOLD I NEEDED YOUR TYPE OF ATTORNEY TO FIGHT LLAPI AUTO SALES HUDSON FLA.

I DID NOT RECEIVE ALL OF THE OIL CHANGES FOR THE TWO YEARS, BUT OIL WAS CHANGED ON A REGULAR BASIS. IN OCTOBER  2005 I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FOR THE WEEKEND WHEN I NOTICED A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE.  I PULLED OFF THE INTERSTATE ,AND AS SOON AS I STOPPED, THE ENGINE DIED. I WAITED ABOUT TEN MINUTES  AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE. I DROVE TO A GAS STATION AND CHECKED THE OIL, NO OIL. I PLACED TWO QUARTS OF OIL IN THE ENGINE AND DROVE HOME. OVER THE LAST 1 1/2 YEARS I HAD FOUR MECHANICS, INCLUDING CHRYSLER MECHANICS, TELL ME THAT IT NEEDED  A NEW ENGINE DUE TO OIL SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE. I HAVE BEEN PAYING ON THIS VEHICLE FOR OVER THREE YEARS, AND ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE IT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, I STILL OWE $5500.00 ON THE VEHICLE, AND AM NOT ABLE TO DRIVE. IF THIS WAS TO HAPPEN TO A PERSON IN THE RIGHT SITUATIONS IT COULD BE DEVASTATING, AND LIVES COULD BE LOST. CHRYSLER STATED  IT  WAS A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE NOT TAKING CARE OF THEIR VEHICLES, BUT THEY WERE AWARE THAT THERE  WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE OIL RETURN HEATING UP THE OIL TOO FAST AND CAUSING THE OIL TO SLUDGE. TOYOTA, AUDI, VOLKSWAGEN HAVE ALL HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS, BUT THEY H OWNED UP TO THEM. THESE COMPLAINTS  WERE BECOMING MORE NUMEROUS, AND  WERE STARTING TO COME IN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS, HOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON BEFORE SOMEBODY WAS ACTUALLY INJURED? I AM PERSONALLY OUT OF A LOT OF MONEY, AND WILL BE OUT OF THIS MONEY FOR AT LEAST 2 MORE YEARS, UNLESS I RUN INTO A WINNING LOTTERY TICKET TO PURCHASE A NEW ENGINE. EVERY BODY WAS MAKING MONEY OFF OF THESE ENGINES, EXCEPT THE CONSUMER. I KNOW IT SOUNDS BAD, BUT I HOPE SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WILL GIVE THEIR LIFE TO GIVE YOU THE HINT THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THESE 2.7 LITER V6 ENGINES IN THE SEBRINGS. *AK",

JUST TODAY, I HAD A MECHANIC LISTEN TO THE ENGINE NOISE AND HE SPECULATES THAT IT IS A ROD OR ROD BEARING.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A SYMPTOM OF THE SLUDGE PROBLEM THAT YOUR WEB SITE HAS DOCUMENTED.  I HAVE NOT YET CONFRONTED A CHRYSLER MAINTENANCE REP AND WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TACTICS THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AS SUCCESSFUL.  I HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT REGULAR ABOUT OIL CHANGES, BUT I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, SO WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM PROVING THE MAINTENANCE INTERVALS.  STEERING:  LAST SUMMER I FIRST EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING TIGHTENING.  BASICALLY THE GENERAL FEEL OF THE STEERING WAS TIGHT AND IT WOULD NOT RETURN TO A 'HOME' POSITION AFTER TURNING.  A MECHANIC ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE $1500 TO REPLACE THE RACK ASSEMBLY AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP. ON A HUNCH, I HAD THE POWER STEERING FLUID REPLACED AND WITHIN A WEEK THE STEERING RETURNED TO NORMAL.  AROUND OCT/NOV, THE SYMPTOMS RETURNED AND I HAD ANOTHER POWER STEERING FLUID REPLACEMENT.  THIS TIME THE SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN INTERMITTENT AND HAVE NOT COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.  I HAVE READ A FEW COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET OF OTHER SEBRING OWNERS HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  *JB",

THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN WHILE PROCEEDING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURNS WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND WERE NEAR ACCIDENTS. *AK  THE GEAR SHIFT MOVES SO EASILY FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL WITH JUST THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE CAUSING THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS IT GOES INTO NEUTRAL.  I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN JUST THE FORCE OF STOPPING, BEFORE TURNING, WITH MY HAND RESTING ON THE SHIFTER PUSHED IT OUT OF GEAR.  THE SECOND TIME JUST MOVING MY PURSE ONTO THE CONSOLE PUSHED IT OUT OF GEAR.   I HAVE OWNED 4 OTHER VEHICLES WITH FLOOR SHIFTERS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIFTER WITHOUT FIRST PRESSING IN THE RELEASE BUTTON.   I THOUGHT THE REASON THE GEAR RELEASE BUTTONS WERE INSTALLED ON VEHICLES WAS TO PREVENT THE ACCIDENTAL MOVEMENT OF THE GEAR SHIFT.   WHEN SITTING IN THIS VEHICLE THE ONLY PLACE TO COMFORTABLY REST YOUR RIGHT ARM IS ON THE ARM REST WHICH THEN EXTENDS TO YOUR FINGERS RESTING ON THE BALL OF THE SHIFTER.  TO ACCESS THE RELEASE BUTTON YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO UNDER SHIFTER TO PRESS IT IN, THIS IS A SAFE PROCEDURE, BUT NOW THAT I FOUND OUT THAT IT DOES NOT  WORK THAT WAY I AM CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF GETTING INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF IT.  I NOW FIND MYSELF SITTING ON MY RIGHT HAND WHILE DRIVING AND WHEN A PASSENGER IS IN THE FRONT SEAT I WARN THEM NOT TO BUMP THE SHIFTER WHILE REACHING FOR THEIR DRINK IN THE HOLDER.  I CALLED THE DEALER TO MAKE SURE THIS WAS NOT A DEFECT AND HE ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NORMAL DESIGN OF THE CAR.  IS THIS A NORMAL DESIGN OF ALL CARS?  IF IT IS, IT IS A VERY POOR DESIGN.",
