THEN, AS I HAD NOT BEEN DRIVING AT NIGHT MUCH, I HAD MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WITH ME COMING FROM RICHMOND TO CONNERSVILLE, IN, AND THIS BECAME SEVERE WHILE IT WAS RAINING WITH FOG. ALL LIGHTS WOULD GO OFF AND COME BACK ON, THEY WOULD ALSO GO OFF EVERYTHING THE DELAYED WIPERS WOULD GO WORK. THEN THE DELAYED WIPERS WOULD GO EVERYTIME THE LIGHTS WOULD FLICKER. AS THE DODGE DEALER COULD NOT NARROW THE PROBLEM DOWN WITHOUT SPENDING MUCH MONEY, I TRIED TO TROUBLESHOOT MYSELF SINCE I DID NOT BELIEVE THE PROBLEM WAS WHAT THEY INSTRUCTED IT MAY BE. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, IT ENDED UP BEING WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS, THE BODY CONTROL MODULE (BCM) OR CENTRAL TIMING MODULE (CTM) OR TIME AND ALARM MODULE WHICH ARE ALL THE SAME THING BUT THE NAME HAS CHANGED AT TIMES. THIS MODULE CONTROLS THE LIGHTS, WIPERS, KEYLESS ENTRY, ETC.

STARTING AT AROUND 20,000 MILES I STARTED GETTING HARD VIBRATIONS IN THE FRONT END, REPLACED ROTORS AND PADS, FIXED PROBLEM.   THEN, 5,000 MILES LATER IT STARTED AGAIN, HAD ROTORS TURNED AND REPLACED PADS, FIXED PROBLEM.  5,000 MILES LATER IT HAPPENS AGAIN, I DECIDE TO DEAL WITH IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. 2,000 MILES OF DRIVING WITH WARPED ROTORS, AND RIGHT FRONT CALIPER LOCKS UP, NEARLY CAUSING A FIRE!!. REPLACED BOTH CALIPERS, ROTORS AND PADS, PROBLEM FIXED AGAIN.  PROBLEM RECURS ROUGHLY EVERY 5,000 MILES. I DRIVE VERY CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT I AM NOT CAUSING ANY UNDUE STRESS ON THE BRAKE COMPONENTS. THE EXPENSE OF REPAIRING THE BRAKES EVERY 5,000 MILES IS ROUGHLY $200 TO $400 DOLLARS DEPENDING ON WHAT I FIND UPON INSPECTION.    I AM AN INDUSTRIAL MECHANIC SO I DO THIS WORK MYSELF. I PURCHASED COPIES OF DAIMLER CHRYSLER MASTER TECH VIDEOS TO MAKES SURE THAT I AM NOT MISSING SOMETHING. I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL MANUALS FOR MY VEHICLE , SOME FROM DODGE AND SOME AFTERMARKET IN MY SEARCH FOR A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.    THIS PROBLEM IS VERY DANGEROUS, TO ME AND TO OTHERS AROUND ME WHEN DRIVING. I AM CURRENTLY AT 90,000 MILES AND HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY SOMEONE...

(2) BRAKES WOULD PULSATE ANYTIME BRAKES WERE APPLIED. DEALER ATTRIBUTED THIS TO WARPING OF ROTORS AND REPLACED PADS AND TURNED THE ROTORS. DEALER NOTED A SPRING ON DRIVER-SIDE CALIPER WAS MISSING AND REPLACED IT AS WELL. (3) THE HEATER/AC CONTROLS FAILED. (4) WENT FOR STATE INSPECTION AND INSPECTOR FAILED TRUCK DUE TO FAILURE OF UPPER BALL JOINTS AND BRAKES. THE SAME BRAKES I JUST HAD FIXED IN FEBRUARY. PREMATURE FAILURE OF BALL JOINTS ATTRIBUTED TO \"TYPICAL PROBLEM FOR DAKOTAS/DURANGOS\". WELL IF IT'S TYPICAL, WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL?? THE DEALER HAD NO ANSWERS.

I HAVE TAKEN THE TRUCK TO 3 LOCAL DEALERS AND THEY SAID THE ABS IS WORKING AS DESIGNED. THE LAST DEALER I TOOK IT TO I TALKED TO THE TECH. HE SAID IT IS A BAD DESIGN. HE ALSO SAID THE MASTER CYLINDER VACUUM CHAMBER IS TO SMALL. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND ALL 2001 AND NEWER TRUCKS SHOULD BE RECALLED.

TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS THE STEER STOP.  THEY TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG, JUST NOT TO TURN THE WHEELS ALL THE WAY TO ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER.  AT 25,000 I REPLACED THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY WENT BALD ON THE OUTER EDGE, BUT HAD PLENTY OF TREAD ON THE INNER EDGE.  ON THE NEWS, I HEARD ABLE THE ISSUES WITH THE BALL JOINTS ON DODGE DAKOTAS AND DURANGOS.  UPON RESEARCHING THE BALL JOINT ISSUE, I FOUND THAT FAILURE OF THE BALL JOINTS CAN LEAD TO POPPING AND CREAKING NOISES IN THE SUSPENSION, AND PREMATURE TIRE WEAR.  I ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE INSTANCES WHERE THE WHEEL ACTUALLY SEPARATED FROM THE VEHICLE.  ON 11/13/2003, THE FACTORY WARRANTY EXPIRED...LEAVING ME ON THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THE NOISE HAS SINCE GOTTEN LOUDER, SO ON 1/19/2004 I TOOK MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE NOISE CHECKED AND TO ENSURE THAT THE VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE.

THE LAST CONTACT FROM NHTSA WAS THAT THEY WAS GOING TO MAKE DODGE RECALL THESE VEHICLES FOR THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM. IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANY MORE ON THIS ISSUE.  I HELP BY GETTING NAMES OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT WAS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I MANAGE AN AUTO PARTS STORE A  AUTO OF MADISON WV AND THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISOLATED PROBLEM. I KNOW OF 4 DAKOTA THAT WERE WRECKED AND SUSTAINED SEVERE DAMAGE DUE TO BALL JOINT FAILURE. THE ADJUSTER FROM STATE FARM'S MOTHER HAD A WRECK DUE TO BALL JOINT FAILURE. AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN SEVERAL THAT HAD WRECKED. I COULD REPLACE THESE BALL JOINTS WITH AFTERMARKET MOOG BRAND AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE UP TO ME TO SOLVE IT. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AFTER THE FIRESTONE EPISODE THAT ISSUES LIKE THIS WOULD BE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY. I CONTACTED THE DEALER TODAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CHECK THE BALL JOINTS EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON KILLING SOMEONE BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE 1997. THE DEALER SAID THAT THE BALL JOINTS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SO MUCH PLAY FROM THE FACTORY. THE AFTERMARKET ONE I SELL DO NOT. ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE KNOWS THAT IF A COMPONENT IN A HIGH STRESS AREA THAT TAKES A LOT OF BEATING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY PLAY. THE LONGER YOU DRIVE IT THE WORSE IT GETS.  I RECENTLY TOOK A WV STATE INSPECTION CLASS. THE STATE POLICE HAVE DODGE DURANGO'S. HE SAID TO MAKE SURE AND CHECK THE BALL JOINTS BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM I AM . SO I THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO GET THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED, BEFORE SOME ELSE WRECKS OR SOMEONE GETS KILLED.

WHERE THE PORT IS ATTACHED TO THE RAIL (BY BRAZING I THINK) SEEMS TO LEAK FUEL. IT IS A SLOW LEAK AND YOU CAN ONLY TELL IF THE ENGINE HAS SOME MILES ON IT YOU CAN NOTICE WHERE A WET RING HAS FORMED. I NOTICED THIS ON MY VEHICLE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING I DID DURING MAINTENANCE FEELING IT WAS MY FAULT I DID NOT WANT TO USE MY WARRANTY. I THEN CALLED AROUND TO GET A USED ONE BECAUSE I DIDN''T HAVE THE $400 TO SLAP DOWN FOR A NEW ONE. UPON RECEIVING MY USED FUEL RAIL IN THE MAIL I NOTICED IT HAD EVIDENCE OF LEAKAGE IN THE SAME AREA. I RETURNED THE USED FUEL RAIL. NEXT I LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD OF MY MOTHERS DODGE RAM W/ THE SAME FUEL RAIL AND TO MY SURPRISE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF FUEL SEEPAGE ON IT ALSO. I''VE HAVE NOTICED THIS ON 3 SEPARATE FUEL RAILS AND I HAVE ONLY LOOKED AT 3 SO I''M 100% SO FAR. I TEMPORARY FIXED MY OWN RAIL BY REMOVING THE RAILS AND WELDING AROUND THE FITTING.

MY MOTHER SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON THE PHONE WITH GOODYEAR AND SULLIVAN TIRE (THE NAME GOODYEAR GAVE US AS THEIR AUTHORIZED DEALER). THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION BECAUSE GOODYEAR AND SULLIVAN INSISTED THEY COULD ONLY PRO-RATE THE TREAD ON A REPLACEMENT.  THE TREAD WAS NOT THE PROBLEM!!! ALL FOUR TIRES SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE BECAUSE THEY WERE A SAFETY HAZARD.  MY MOTHER PAID $431.71 FOR FOUR NEW TIRES, WHICH IS LESS THAN $100 UNDER THE PRICE SULLIVAN WOULD HAVE CHARGED FOR FOUR NEW TIRES.  THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF CHARGE! I SEE FROM THE COMPLAINTS ALREADY SUBMITTED THAT THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES. GOODYEAR INSISTED THEY HAD RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS TIRE. THEY OBVIOUSLY LIED.  DT",

THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY PRESENT IN VECHICLES DRIVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS. I CONTINUED TO ARGUE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER BUT HE STILL CHARGED ME FOR THE REPAIR BUT DID REDUCE THE CHARGE SOME. NOW AT 37000 MILES I AM EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. THE MECHANIC DID RECOMMEND THAT I BUY AN AFTERMARKEY ROTER SINCE THE DODGE ROTOR WAS NO GOOD! WOW WHAT A COMMENT FROM A DODGE DEALERSHIP. ANYWAY THIS IS A DANGERIOUS SITUATION SINCE THE WARPED ROTORS COULD HEAT UP AND CRACK CAUSING A WHEEL LOCK UP. THE WARPAGE CAN ALSO CAUSE REDUCED STOPPING ABILITY.

I NOTICED MY FRONT BRAKES PULSATING AT APPROXIMATELY 16,000 MILES. I DRIVE 90% HIWAY WITH VERY LITTLE CITY TRAFFIC. I DRIVE VERY CONSERVATIVELY. (NO HARD BRAKING) RECENTLY WHILE EXITING THE HIWAY I APPLIED MY BRAKES AT 45MPH AND HAD TREMENDOUS PULSATING INSTANTLY WHICH CAUSED MY VEHICLE TO LOSE IT'S BRAKING ABILITY. I WAS ABLE TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE BUT IT PROMPTED ME TO GET THE PROBLEM RESOLVED. I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER EXPECTING THEM TO FIND A REASON AS TO WHY THE ROTORS ARE WARPED AFTER VERY LITTLE USE. THEY TOLD ME THAT \"THEY DON'T MAKE BRAKES THE WAY THEY USED TO\". AFTER VIEWING THE WEB SITE NOTED ABOVE; IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS A UNDERDESIGNED ROTOR USED ON DODGE DAKOTAS AS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DISIPATE THE HEAT GENERATED DURING NORMAL DRIVING. THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME AN ACCIDENT. I DO NOT WANT TO BE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT HAS INFERIOR BRAKE DESIGN OR MATERIALS. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT I CAN GET BETTER ROTORS AND PADS FROM AFTER MARKET MANUFACTURER'S. WHY DOESN'T DODGE USE THOSE? AS A VOLUNTEER FIREMAN I GO TO MANY ACCIDENT SCENES. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE OF A CHOICE BY THE MANUFACTURER, DODGE, TO USE LESS EXPENSIVE BRAKING COMPONENTS. BY THE WAY THE DODGE DURANGO IS ALMOST IDENTICLE TO THE DAKOTA YET HARDLY HAS ANY BRAKE ISSUES. SOUNDS LIKE THAT VEHICLE IS EQUIPED WITH THE PROPER COMPONENTS. I HAVE MY WARPED ROTORS AND BREAK PADS TAKEN OFF MY DAKOTA IF YOU'D LIKE TO USE IN YOUR INVESTIGATION. I AM SURE THAT THE ROTOR IS NOT PROPERLY DESIGNED FOR THE NORMAL STOPPING REQUIREMENTS OF THE DOAGE DAKOTA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. JAMES BUCKLEY.  *AK",
