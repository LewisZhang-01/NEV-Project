I was notified the excessive rust on the frame has cause damage to the lines for the brakes/bubbling on the lines, fuel line, power steering fluid lines and, eventually, other undercar items may soon fail.  It is recommended that due to the excessive rusting/premature frame rotting, the SUV should be decommissioned and off the road.   Toyota dealership actually suggested that it might be necessary for me to sign a waiver in order to take the vehicle out of the dealership. The waiver was to hold Toyota harmless should something result as a result of the defect. I was shocked at the request/I declined.  Stated the severe rusting is from the front to the rear of the frame.  Research shows the Toyota Corporation is fully aware of the excessive rusting on the Toyota Sequoia SUVs however no remedy has been in place to resolve the issue for current owners.  I am advised to replace the fuel lines (approximately $1700 for parts and labor), however, upon replacement the excessive rusting to the frame may damage the other lines in the vehicle and the frame will need to be replaced as well (about $10,000).  The 2nd technician stated he has done work on 20+ year old SUVs a lot, none with anywhere near this type of premature rusted frame. Stated he couldn't believe how bad it is.  Said it flakes apart when you touch it anywhere. He stressed that I should not have my octogenarian mom, and 1st grader in the vehicle.  This is our family vehicle.  The 2001 Sequoia SUV was built on a tundra frame which had a structural recall (NHTSA action number: pe09049) for frames built in 2000 and 2001.  The Sequoia was left out of this recall; a 2012 Spray Option was offered for the frame (I was told by \"Israel\" today / Brand Ambassador Department).  I never received the notification. No dupport from Toyota.  The frame, fuel lines need replacement.  Pls help!",

I was informed by the shop that the frame had completely rusted through, causing the rear stabilizer arm to become detached. I also had a front stabilizer link fail twice in a year, presumably from the frame excessively flexing.   Upon further investigation, I came to learn that Toyota is quite aware of this very issue, they\u2019ve issued recalls where insufficient measures may have been taken to temporarily stop the rusting, and that many many other Sequoia owners have the same exact problems that I\u2019m having, and Toyota refuses to take responsibility for this premature failure and provide some sort of relief.  Given the frequency and number of complaints, I\u2019m kind of shocked that NHTSA hasn\u2019t banned these vehicles from the roadways. Seems like a serious accident waiting to happen. It\u2019s not like the facts are in question in this case. There must be hundreds or thousands of examples.  If you do a web search for \u201c2001-2004 toyota sequoia rust corrosion on frame\u201d you\u2019ll find a bunch of examples, as well as accounts of Toyota\u2019s numerous refusals to stand behind their mistakes.  I still have the vehicle, and would gladly help you with any investigation. I did have part of the frame welded just so I could limp it back home to WI. I towed it on a trailer.

BOTH OCCASIONS OCCURRED ON INTERSTATE 40 NEAR RALEIGH , NC.  THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND THE ROAD CONDITIONS WERE DRY, SOLID (NO SAND OR GRAVEL) SURFACE.   WHEN THE SYSTEM ENGAGED AT APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH, THE VEHICLE WAS PULLED TO THE RIGHT NEARLY UNCONTROLLABLY, THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGED (GRINDING METAL-ON-METAL SOUND0, AND THE ENGINE SPEED WAS REDUCED.  IN ADDITION, THE TRAC AND VSC ICONS LIT UP ON THE DASH AND THE RE WAS A BEEPING SOUND.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  HAD THERE BEEN A VEHICLE IN THE LANE TO MY RIGHT, I COULD NOT HAVE AVOIDED HITTING THEM.  FORTUNATELY, NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED AND THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT, BUT THIS WAS PURELY LUCK.    AFTER THE FIRST EVENT I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO MARK JACOBSON TOYOTA IN DURHAM, NC ON NOV 14, 2019 ( I HAVE THE SERVICE RECEIPT.)  THEY STATED THAT THEY \"COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM\" AND SAID THAT THEY DID A \"ZERO POINT CALIBRATION.\"  I HAVE NOT HAD THE VEHICLE SERVICED AFTER THE SECOND EPISODE SINCE IT HAPPENED JUST YESTERDAY.    A SURVEY OF THE INTERNET REVEALS MULTIPLE OTHER FIRST GENERATION SEQUOIA OWNERS REPORTING THE SAME THING, BUT THERE IS NO REPORTED SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  THE ONLY \"FIX\" THAT WORKS CONSISTENTLY IS TO REMOVE THE ABS SYSTEM FUSE; HARDLY A SOLUTION, SINCE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME TO DISABLE A CRITICAL AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY SYSTEM.  NEVERTHELESS, GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE ABS SYSTEM ENERGIZED, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT DISABLING THE ABS SYSTEM IS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS.  I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR YOU HELP IN FINDING A SAFE SOLUTION TO THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION.",

AFTER TAKING IT TO THE MECHANIC, WE DISCOVERED IT WAS AN O2 SENSOR CAUSING THE ENGINE LIGHT ON, BUT ALSO NOTICED EXTREME RUST ON THE ENTIRE FRAME. THE MECHANIC DETERMINED THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE AND RECOMMENDED THE ENTIRE FRAME BE REPLACED AS THAT KNOCKING WOULD CAUSE THE FRONT HALF OF THE VEHICLE TO SEPARATE FROM THE BACK HALF AND CAUSE A SERIOUS ISSUE.  AFTER TALKING TO TOYOTA BODY SHOP, SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND A MECHANIC, I LEARNED OF A CAMPAIGN THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED.  TOYOTA ISSUED THE CAMPAIGN DUE TO SEVERE RUST OF ITS TOYOTA TUNDRA BUT FAILED TO OFFER THE SAME COVERAGE FOR TOYOTA SEQUOIA ISSUED FOR 2001. THE CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ISSUED WAS FOR 2005-2008 SEQUOIA, HOWEVER MY TOYOTA WAS MADE IN 2001.

I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE YEARLY STATE INSPECTION SHOWED THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.  I OFTEN PULL A 5000# SKI BOAT, AND 2 HORSE TRAILER BEHIND MY SEQUOIA.  I WILL NOT RISK THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, MY HORSES, AND FELLOW MOTORISTS BY DRIVING THIS CAR.  BUT, HOW MANY DRIVERS ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE?  HOW MANY BELIEVE THE TOYOTA RECALL WAS EFFECTIVE AND THEIR VEHICLES ARE SAFE?  I BELIEVE TOYOTA KNEW THE RUST TREATMENT WAS SIMPLY A WAY TO BUY SOME TIME AND THEY ARE NOW REJECTING CASES \"THAT RECALL CAMPAIGN HAS EXPIRED\" WAS WHAT [XXX] MY TOYOTA CASE MANAGER'S TOLD ME.  SHE DIDN'T OFFER ANY HELP, NO BUYBACK, NO FRAME REPLACEMENT, AND SHE DIDN'T SAY I SHOULD NO LONGER DRIVE THE CAR.  TOYOTA KNOWS THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM AND THEY ARE NOW PUTTING THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AT RISK, AND ALL WHO SHARE THE ROADS WITH THESE UNSAFE VEHICLES.  THE ISSUE WILL BE MOST ACUTE IN THE AREAS OF THE US WHERE HIGHWAYS ARE SALTED AND TREATED FOR WINTER DRIVING.  DRIVER'S IN UPSTATE NY, NH, MAINE, MI, WI, MN, ETC. ARE AT HIGH RISK AND TOYOTA KNOWS.      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THE ENTIRE WHEEL ASSEMBLY WAS SHEARING OFF.  THE CONDITION WAS MORE COMMON IN A TURN, BUT COULD BE INDUCED IN A BUMP. I HAD RECENTLY INSTALLED NEW TIRES AND A SUSPENSION SO THE DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED THAT THE SLIGHTLY OVERSIZED TIRE (P265/75R-16) WAS HE CAUSE.  I REPLACED THE BRAND NEW PIRELLI TIRES WITH THE FACTORY SIZE MICHELLIN'S HOWEVER THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  I HAD THE VEHICLE RE-INSPECTED AND THE TECHNICIANS STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A WORN RACK & PINION ASSEMBLY.  I PAID TO HAVE A NEW ASSEMBLY INSTALLED; THOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN TEST DRIVEN IT EXHIBITED THE SAME SYMPTOMS WHEN I DROVE IT.  AFTER RETURNING TO THE DEALER I HAD THE HEAD MECHANIC TEST DRIVE WITH ME; HE STATED THAT THIS WAS A NORMAL VSC OPERATING CONDITION.  I INSISTED TO SPEAK WITH SOMEONE HIGHER UP AND HAPPENED TO CONNECT WITH A TOYOTA FACTORY ENGINEER FROM JAPAN.  AFTER A TEST DRIVE HE CONCLUDED THE PROBLEM WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING IN THE VSC SYSTEM.  AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION THEY DISCOVERED A SENSOR WAS BAD.  I HAD TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR AS WELL.

ON JUNE 12, 2015 I HAD PERFORMED PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE ON SAME VEHICLE NOW WITH 225,345 MILES THE INSPECTION OF FRAME REVEALED SEVERAL SITES OF RUST THROUGHOUT THE FRAME IN SOME CASES THE RUST HAS ROTTED THROUGH. I WAS ADVISED SINCE THE MANUFACTURER PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN 2012 THEY ARE NO LONGER LIABLE AND WOULD NOT REPLACE FRAME AT THEIR COST. HENCE MY COMPLAINT FOR A FAIR RESOLUTION.

I HAD ALMOST COME TO A COMPLETE STOP BEFORE MY FRONT BUMPER TAPPED HER REAR BUMPER. MY BODY DID NOT EVEN MOVE WHEN THE TWO BUMPERS TAPPED EACH OTHER. NO DAMAGE WAS NOTICED ON EITHER BUMPER, NOT EVEN A SCRATCH.   MY WINDSHIELD HAD TO BE REPLACED THAT DAY IN ORDER FOR ME TO DRIVE HOME. I WAITED 5 HOURS FOR THE REPAIR MAN TO COME.  I FILLED THIS ON MY AUTO INSURANCE WINDSHIELD POLICY AND PAID MY $50 DEDUCTIBLE.  ALFA INSURANCE PROMPTLY RAISED MY COLLISION DEDUCTIBLE FROM $250 TO $500 AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD NEVER REPLACE ANOTHER WINDSHIELD. IF THE AIR BAGS HAD NOT SHATTERED THE WINDSHIELD THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  I AM SO ANGRY AT TOYOTA.  NO INSURANCE CLAIM WAS FILLED BY THE OTHER DRIVER SINCE THERE WAS NO DAMAGE.  NO TICKET WAS GIVEN BY THE OFFICER THAT CAME TO THE SCENE. THE OFFICER TOLD ME THAT THE AIR BAGS SHOULD NOT HAVE DEPLOYED AND THAT HE THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THIS IS WHAT CAUSED ME TO INVESTIGATE AND FOUND THE AIR BAG RECALL ON THE SEQUOIA STARTING IN 2002, BUT DID NOT INCLUDE 2001.  I FILLED A MALFUNCTION REPORT WITH TOYOTA AND THEY SENT OUT AN INVESTIGATOR.  AFTER 45 DAYS I RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE SENSORS AND DENIED THE CLAIM.  I HAVE NOT HAD THE USE OF MY SEAT BELTS, HORN OR AIR BAGS TO PROVIDE A SAFE RIDE SINCE JANUARY.  I HAVE HAD TO DRIVE THROUGH ICE AND SNOW WITH NO PROTECTION FOR MY FOUR CHILDREN OR I.

PURCHASED THE VEHICLE USED FROM TOYOTA DEALER AS A FAMILY VEHICLE BECAUSE MY WIFE AND I HAD OUR FIRST CHILD.  VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.  WHY IS THIS NOT A SAFETY RECALL?

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THEY SCANNED AND NOTHING, ASKED ME IF I COULD LEAVE THE CAR ONE MORE DAY. NEXT DAY THEY CALL ME TO SAY THAT YAW RATE SENSOR WAS FAULTY.  I REPLACED, SENSOR PLUS LABOR WAS $ 800. I HAVE NOT FELT THAT PROBLEM AGAIN. TOYOTA PEOPLE SEEM THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT THEY KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING.

I WAS INFORMED THAT MY VEHICLE DID HAVE A HOLE IN THE FRAME AND QUALIFIED FOR A FRAME REPLACEMENT. PICTURES WERE TAKEN. I WAS PROMISED COPIES BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEM.   APPARENTLY TUNDRA AND THE TACOMA VEHICLES WERE ALSO PREVIOUSLY RECALLED FOR FRAME RUST DUE TO USING INFERIOR METAL WHICH RUSTED FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND BY THE TIME IT WAS VISIBLE IT WAS TOO LATE TO CORRECT.

THE SEQUOIA AND TUNDRA ARE BUILT USING THE SAME FRAME AND MAY BE BUILT ON THE SAME ASSEMBLY LINE, AND PROBABLY USE THE SAME STEEL FOR THE FRAME.

EVEN IF WE HAVE IT FIXED, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL NOT CEASE.  I HAD THIS HAPPEN TWICE IN THE LAST 2 DAYS, BUT  THOUGHT I'D RUN OVER A POTHOLE OR SOMETHING.  TODAY, IT WAS SMOOTH PAVEMENT AND NICE WEATHER.  WE REALLY NEED A RECALL TO SAVE LIVES!  *TR",

THE MORE I PUT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES, THE MORE THE METAL GRINDING NOISE WAS INTENSIFIED. FELT LIKE THE ENGINE WAS GOING TO BE DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD OR THE TIRES WERE SCRAPED TO THE BONE. PROBLEM FIRST HAPPENED IN APRIL, BUT THOUGHT IT WAS NOTHING BECAUSE AS FAST AS IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, IT QUICKLY WENT AWAY ALSO. HOWEVER, 2 WEEKS AGO, MY HUSBAND AND MY SON WERE IN MY CAR AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS TIME IT LASTED LONGER AND MY HUSBAND HAD TO TRY HIS BEST TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT WAS SWERVING AND SHAKING SO BAD, AND THE LOUD GRINDING NOISE WAS BACK. WE KEPT THE CAR IN THE GARAGE FOR A WEEK IN HOPES THAT IT WILL \"GO AWAY.\" TODAY, 5/16/12, AS I'M DRIVING AT 50MPH IT HAPPENED AGAIN.THANKFULLY, THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME, AND JUST A TRUCK A LITTLE WAYS AHEAD OF ME. BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING AT A SPEED OF 55MPH, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP. I PUT PRESSURE ON MY BRAKES TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE MORE I TRIED TO PUSH THE BRAKES, THE LOUDER THE NOISE WAS AND THE MORE THE CAR WAS SHAKING. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST TERRIFYING EVENTS IN MY LIFE BECAUSE I SAW THAT I WAS APPROACHING THE BACK OF THE TRUCK FAST AND I COULDN'T STOP, I TRIED TO PULL TO THE SIDE BUT THERE WERE NO ROOM BECAUSE THE SIDES WERE JUST GUARD RAILS. AT THAT POINT, I PUT MORE PRESSURE ON MY BRAKES BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA BE KILLED OR HURT ANYONE ELSE, SO MY CAR FINALLY STARTED TO SLOWED DOWN. THE SCARIEST PART WAS THAT I COULD NOT BRAKE. THE MORE I APPLIED MY BRAKES, THE LOUDER THE NOISE, AND THE MORE THE CAR WAS SHAKING.",

HE SHOWED ME EXTENSIVE RUST HOLES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAME WELDS ON BOTH THE PASSENGER AND DRIVER'S SIDE. HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL CASE HAS SEVERE RUST DAMAGE. HE STRONGLY URGED ME TO STOP DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND STATED THAT IT IS UNSAFE IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN SUCH EXTENSIVE FRAME RUST DAMAGE ON A VEHICLE THIS WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THE DRIVE TRAIN, OUTER BODY, AND INTERIOR ARE IN MINT CONDITION.  I ALSO HAVE ALWAYS MADE IT A POINT TO POWER WASH THE SALT (CALCIUM CHLORIDE) OFF THE UNDER CARRIAGE AFTER DRIVING IN THE NORTHEAST AFTER SNOW OR ICE STORMS, WHEN SALT IS USED ON OUR ROADS.  I CONTACTED MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY GAVE ME THE PHONE NUMBER TO TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS.  THE END RESULT WAS, THEY WERE SORRY TO HEAR THAT I HAD A ROTTED OUT FRAME AND SUGGESTED THAT I GET RID OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THERE IS CURRENTLY NO RECALL FOR THE SEQUOIAS.  ALTHOUGH, AFTER GOING ONLINE AT THE TOYOTA FORUM I FOUND OUT THAT THEY'RE ARE OVER 300 CONSUMERS WITH THE SAME TYPE OF ISSUE WITH THEIR SEQUOIA FRAMES IN OUR STATE, SO I DO NOT STAND ALONE.  I AM FLOORED THAT A COMPANY LIKE TOYOTA, THAT PRIDES ITSELF IN BEING COMMITTED TO SAFETY DOES NOT CARE AND WILL NOT TAKE OWNERSHIP WHEN THEY KNOWINGLY USED CHEAP JAPANESE STEEL TO BUILD THESE FAULTY FRAMES. I CURRENTLY HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN AND THIS IS MY PRIMARY VEHICLE. I CANNOT AFFORD TO THROW $8 K AWAY (KELLY BLUE BOOK) ON THIS VEHICLE.  PLEASE HELP!

MY CONCERN IS, HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE WHO OWNS A 2001 TOYOTA SEQUOIA? IF NOT, CAN IT HAPPEN AGAIN? THANKS NHTSA.",

HE STRESSED THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE MY CHILDREN IN THAT VEHICLE. MY FAMILY VEHICLE. I CALLED TOYOTA COMPLAINTS DEPT. THE REP TOLD ME HE WAS THE SENIOR REP THERE AND THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING ON A SEQUOIA.  TOLD ME THAT LOTS OF TRUCKS OF ALL MAKES HAVE FRAME RUST PROBLEMS. HE EXPLAINED THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER DID TO THE VEHICLE - WHETHER HE DID ANY UNDERBODY MAINTENANCE (HE SUGGESTED THAT CAR OWNERS GENERALLY RINSE THE UNDERCARRIAGE AFTER DRIVING IN THE SNOW). HE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT \"..FOR ALL WE KNOW, THIS VEHICLE COULD HAVE BEEN IN A FLOOD.\" DOES A FLOOD CAUSE AGGRESSIVE FRAME RUST BUT LEAVE THE REST OF THE VEHICLE IN MINT SHAPE? SAID THERE WERE NO \"PROGRAMS\" FOR ME AT THIS TIME AND SUGGESTED I CALL NHTSA. II HAD TO ASK - WILL NHTSA WILL HELP ME BUY A VEHICLE TO DRIVE MY KIDS TO THEIR FUNCTIONS WITHOUT RISKING THEIR LIVES?

THE DEALER SAID THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN SO MUCH CORROSION UNDER A VEHICLE BEFORE.  THEY SAID THAT THE FRAME, EXHAUST, SPARE TIRE, AND BRAKE COMPONENTS AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS LOOKED TO HAVE WHAT THEY WOULD CALL EXCESSIVE CORROSION.  THEY SAID I SHOULD TAKE IT UP WITH WHOM I BOUGHT IT FROM.  I THINK THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE TUNDRAS ARE HAVING WITH CORROSION AND SHOULD BE LOOPED INTO THE SAME INVESTIGATION.  THE SEQUOIA, I WAS TOLD WHEN I BOUGHT IT, WAS DESIGNED ON THE SAME FRAME, AND DRIVE TRAIN AS THE TUNDRA WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE CORROSION IS EFFECTING SIMILAR BRAKING SYSTEMS AND THE SPARE.

WE WERE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAR BUT COULD NOT SEE IN THE  BACK W/ THE DARK TINTED WINDOWS.  IN THE MEAN TIME, ONE DAUGHTER, WHO WAS SITTING IN THE 3RD ROW, MIDDLE SEAT OF OUR 2001 TOYOTA SEQUOIA, BECAME TANGLED IN THE AUTOMATICALLY LATCHED SEATBELT.

THE WORST THING IS THAT WE COULDN'T UNLATCH THE BELT, NOR COULD WE UNTANGLE HER.  WE STARTED YELLING FOR SOMETHING SHARP TO CUT THE BELT (THE AIRPORT IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO FIND SOMETHING SHARP) AND AT THE SAME TIME WE GRABBED THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION TO ATTEMPT TO STICK INTO THE LATCH IN HOPES OF UNLATCHING THE BELT IN AN ALTERNATIVE WAY.  IN WHAT SEEMED AN ETERNITY OF HELPLESSNESS, THE SKY CAP FOUND SCISSORS AND CUT THE BELT... AT THE SAME TIME, I RELEASED THE BELT FROM THE LATCH W/ THE HELP OF THE KEY.

IT BECAME EXTREMELY HARD TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND BRAKING POWER WAS GREATLY REDUCED AND THE SEQUOIA WAS BASICALLY UNCONTROLLABLE.

THE TIRE, WHEEL RIM, HUB, STEERING RACK, STEERING TIE ROD, CONTROL ARMS, BRAKE LINES, DRIVE AXLE, ETC. HAD ALL BEEN DAMAGE SEVERELY.      PICTURES OF THE SCENE SHOW A SINGLE SKID MARK FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT WHEEL CLEARLY.  THE SINGLE SKID MARK INDICATES THAT ONE WHEEL WAS NOT ROTATING AT ALL, WHILE THE OTHER THREE WERE ROTATING FREELY, OR UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES.    I FOUND NO MY 2001 RECALLS.  I LATER FOUND NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER : 05V225000 INDICATING A RECALL DUE TO FAILED BALL JOINTS IN THE 2002-2004 SEQUOIA.  THE SEQUOIA MODEL WAS FIRST AVAILABLE AS A MY2001 AND INITIAL INTRODUCTION WAS LATE IN 2000.  MY2002 STARTED IN THE LATE SUMMER OF 2001.  I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO QUICKLY AFTER THE MODEL INTRODUCTION TOYOTA WOULD MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE SUSPENSION AND/OR BALL JOINTS.  IT WAS BY LUCK ONLY THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED DUE TO THE SUSPENSION FAILURE, TOYOTA NEEDS TO REACT QUICKLY AND NOTIFY MY2001 OWNERS OF THIS DANGEROUS DEFECT.  NOT ONLY DID THE SUSPENSION FAIL, CAUSING THE WHEEL TO MOVE BACK AND JAM INTO THE REAR WHEEL WELL AREA, BUT IT SEEMED TO CAUSE AN ALMOST TOTAL LOSS OF BRAKING ABILITY.  I BELIEVE THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES RESPONDED TO THE LOCKED FRONT WHEEL BY MODULATING THE POWER TO THE OTHER WHEELS RESULTING IN LESS BRAKING FORCE.  *JB",

CONSIDERING  COST OF VEHICLE DEALERS SHOULD OWN UP TO THE VEHICLE FAULTS, ADVISE CONSUMERS OF CURRENT PROBS AND \"REPLACE\" (NOT GRIND)  BADLY ENGINEERED PARTS, TIRES, ETC.

SECOND IS THAT I GOT THE RUN AROUND ABOUT I SHOULD TRY A ''FOR FUN AND GIGGLES'' BY NOT RUNNING MY RECYCLING MODE WHEN DRIVING WITH THE A/C ON. THIRD IS THAT WHEN THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE OPEN I''M STILL GETTING THE WORST SMELL OF EXHAUST COMING FROM THE REAR.
