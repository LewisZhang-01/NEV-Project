LIKE MOST PEOPLE ON HERE, THE TRANSMISSION APPEARS TO BE VERY CONFUSED , ESPECIALLY WHEN DECELERATING INTO THE 20-35 MPG RANGE AND ATTEMPTING TO RE-ACCELERATE BACK UP. IT WILL MISFIRE OR BE VERY UNRESPONSIVE, AND THEN CLUNK AND JERK YOU FORWARD ONCE IT DECIDES TO CHANGE GEARS.

IN THIS INSTANCE, I FEEL LIKE IT DOWN SHIFTS INSTANTLY AND IT FEELS LIKE THE TRUCK IS BEING PULLED BACK (INSTEAD OF SIMPLY COASTING LIKE I WOULD WANT), AND THEN AT SOME POINT IT \"RELEASES\" FROM THIS AND THE TRUCK ACTUALLY STOPS DECELERATING AND SPEEDS UP A BIT, EVEN THOUGH THE GAS HAD BEEN RELEASED MANY SECONDS AGO. THIS IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS IN STOP AND GO CITY TRAFFIC.  I THINK THE OVERARCHING PROBLEM HERE IS THE SHIFT POINTS THAT THE ECM HAS DETERMINED (OR BEEN PROGRAMMED WITH). YOU CAN TELL THIS WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, MY TRUCK GETS TO THIRD GEAR BY 15 MILES PER HOUR AND NEVER GOES ABOVE 2K RPM'S???
