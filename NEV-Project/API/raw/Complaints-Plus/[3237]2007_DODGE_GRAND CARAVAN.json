BOTH THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER WERE WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS AND TRAVELING 50-55 MPH. AFTER BEING IMPACTED FROM THE REAR, THE VEHICLE SPUN 360 DEGREES. AFTER THE SPIN, THE VAN WAS IMPACTED DIRECTLY HEAD ON, IN THE FRONT, ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, BY A 4 DOOR SEDAN. THE AIR BAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY AND BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEAT BELTS FAILED TO LOCK THE OCCUPANTS TO THEIR SEATS. THIS SAFETY EQUIPMENT FAILURE ALLOWED SIGNIFICANT BODY MOVEMENTS OF BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER. IT CAUSED ABRUPT FORWARD AND BACKWARD MOTION OF THEIR HEADS, NECKS, BACKS, ARMS, LEGS AND TORSOS, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL INJURY AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. THE DRIVER ACCOMPANIED THE FRONT PASSENGER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND X-RAY EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED BY A MEDICAL SPECIALIST. THE PASSENGER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH UPPER SPINE, HEAD AND NECK INJURIES WITH SIGNIFICANT MUSCLE PAIN AND SEVERE CONCUSSION. THE DRIVER HAD INJURIES TO HIS SHOULDER, NECK, KNEE, TORSO AND BACK AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT MUSCLE PAIN. SUMMARY, HAD THE SEAT BELTS FUNCTIONED, AS WAS ADVERTISED AND DESIGNED BY THIS MANUFACTURER, BOTH PASSENGERS WOULD NOT HAVE SUSTAINED SUCH SEVERE PHYSICAL INJURIES, AND HAD THE AIR BAGS FUNCTIONED AND DEPLOYED, AS ADVERTISED AND DESIGNED, BY THE MANUFACTURER, THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THIS IMPACT-COLLISION. HISTORY, THE DODGE GRAND CARAVAN OF PAST YEARS DESIGN  INCLUDING THIS 2007 MODEL YEAR HAVE HAD SIMILAR AND REPEATED REPORTS OF SEAT BELT AND AIR BAG FAILURE. CONCLUSION, THIS MANUFACTURER KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THESE SAFETY DEFEATS, FROM PAST SETTLEMENT LITIGATION.

THIS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY SEVERE, MOST RECENTLY NEARLY CAUSING A COLLISION WHEN THE VAN STALLED OUT AS WE WERE LEAVING THE GAS STATION IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.  THE PROBLEM IS THE VAPOR/LIQUID SEPARATOR VALVE LOCATED AT THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. THE VALVE IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT LIQUID FUEL FROM ENTERING THE CHARCOAL CANISTER/EMISSIONS SYSTEM. WHEN THE VALVE FAILS, LIQUID GAS CAN ENTER THE LINE AND FILL THE CHARCOAL CANISTER.    AFTER REFUELING THE PCM ON THE VEHICLE DETECTS A CHANGE IN FUEL LEVEL. THEN, WHEN THE ENGINE MEETS CERTAIN TEMPERATURE AND DRIVING CRITERIA, THE PCM ISSUES A PURGE COMMAND TO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER TO REMOVE THE STORED GAS VAPORS. IT?S AT THAT POINT THAT ALL THE LIQUID GAS IN THE LINE GETS SUCKED INTO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. THE PCM EXPECTS TO SEE GAS VAPORS ENTERING THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND IT IS PREPARED TO ADJUST AIR/FUEL MIXTURES TO COMPENSATE. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PREPARED TO SEE LIQUID GAS COMING INTO THE INTAKE. THAT?S WHAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL.    UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY FIX IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE GAS TANK. CHRYSLER DOES NOT SELL THE VAPOR/LIQUID VALVE AS A SEPARATE UNIT.    WE ARE NOW AT NEARLY 100,000 MILES, AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS AND CONTINUES TO GET MORE SEVERE.

EXPERT MECHANICS ARE ADVISING TO REPLACE THEM WITH STANDARD VALVES, AND I WILL.    FROM AN ECONOMIC VIEW, THE SEVERAL FAILURES OF THE STEMS, AND STEM FAILURES, HAVE COST ME ABOUT 6 CENTS PER MILE.  GAS HAS COST ME ABOUT 18 CENTS PER MILE (AT TODAYS COST).  THUS, THE TPMS SYSTEM MAINTENANCE IS ABOUT 1/3 OF THE GAS COST.

I NOTICED NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DOOR.  I DROVE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE TO MY HOUSE.  HALFWAY HOME I SMELLED SOMETHING AND WHEN I PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY, I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS MY AIR CONDITIONING UNIT AND BY TURNING THE CAR OFF I WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE SMOKE.  I TRIED TO OPERATE THE AUTOMATIC DOORS FOR MY REAR PASSENGER DOORS BUT THEY DIDN'T WORK.  I  WAS ABLE TO MANUALLY OPEN MY REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO OPEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR NO MATTER HOW HARD I PULLED.  I HAD NO IDEA THAT DOOR WAS ON FIRE AT THAT POINT.  I NOTICED NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DOOR OTHER THAN IT WOULDN'T OPEN.  I HAD TO CLIMB INTO THE BACK THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE  TO GET MY DAUGHTER.  I WENT IN TO THE HOUSE, STILL THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WOULD STOP SMOKING ONCE THE CAR COOLED DOWN AND LET MY DOG OUT IN THE BACK YARD.  I CAME BACK AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AFTER 5 MINUTES.  I SAW GRAY SMOKE BILLOWING OUT OF THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE DOOR I HAD LEFT OPEN TO AIR OUT THE CAR.  I WALKED AROUND TO THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AND I SAW THE PAINT BUBBLING AND MELTING AND LITTLE FLAMES LICKING THE GLASS OF THE DOOR.  AT THAT POINT I CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MY NEIGHBOR TOOK THE HOSE TO THE CAR TO PUT OUT THE EXTERNAL FIRE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME IN 5 MINUTES AND PUT OUT THE FIRE IN THE DOOR.  THEY GAVE ME THE BURNED PIECE AND SAID THEY BELIEVED THAT THE FIRE STARTED IN THE MOTOR FOR THE AUTOMATIC DOOR.  I CALLED IN A COMPLAINT TO CHRYSLER/DODGE.
