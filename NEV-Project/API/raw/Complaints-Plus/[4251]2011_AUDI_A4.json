I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR AN INSPECTION AND OIL CHANGE. THE VEHICLE PASSED INSPECTION, BUT THE MECHANIC NOTED VERY LITTLE OIL IN THE VEHICLE, EVEN THOUGH THE NEXT OIL CHANGE WASN'T FOR 4,000 MILES. AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE 600 MORE MILES, THE CAR INDICATED LOW OIL AGAIN. IN 2015, AUDI LOST A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS ISSUE. IN THE SERVICE RECORDS, THIS VEHICLE UNDERWENT THE FIRST STAGE OF REPAIRS TO CORRECT THE ISSUE IN JAN 2017, WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY EXTENSION GRANTED BY THE LAWSUIT. THE REPAIRS DID NOT WORK. AUDI HAS CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE ISSUE MOST LIKELY AFFECTING MY VEHICLE, AND THEY REFUSE TO COVER IT. MY VEHICLE IS BELOW THE MILEAGE SPECIFIED UNDER THE WARRANTY, BUT HAS MISSED THE YEAR SPECIFIED BY LESS THAN 3 MONTHS. THIS MEANS THAT AUDI KNOWINGLY AUCTIONED A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE WITHOUT FULFILLING THEIR WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS AND DECEPTIVELY PASSED THOSE OBLIGATIONS ON TO INDEPENDENT DEALERS, KNOWING THAT THE ISSUE WOULDN'T BE UNCOVERED IN AN INSPECTION. I'VE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT AUDI TO RESOLVE THIS AMICABLY, BUT THEY WONT GRANT AN EXCEPTION. THEY TOLD ME TO JUST KEEP PUTTING OIL IN THE CAR, BUT THE OIL BURNS AT SUCH A RAPID PACE, I WILL HAVE TO ADD NEW OIL EVERY 2 TANKS OF GAS. THIS WILL RESULT IN THOUSANDS OF EXTRA DOLLARS SPENT A YEAR. THE DEALER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM IS CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE, BUT I SUSPECT THAT BOTH PARTIES WERE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAVE DECIDED TO PASS ON THE BURDEN TO THE CONSUMER. ALL I AM ASKING FOR IS FOR THEM TO CORRECT AN ISSUE THEY WERE ALREADY AWARE OF AND HAD ATTEMPTED TO FIX. THE WARRANTY MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED BY LESS THAN 3 MONTHS, BUT THIS ISSUE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO THAT. OTHERWISE, I WILL NEED TO SPEND $4,000+ TO HAVE THIS REPAIR.",

IVE CHANGE THE OIL IN OCTOBER AND IN 2 MONTHS DECEMBER I USE 5QT OF OIL TO REFILL OR TO ADD ON BECAUSE THE OIL LIGHT WAS TURNING  ON .  IVE TOOK THE CAR TO AUDI AND DID A FULL INSPECTION TO SEE IF I'M LOSING ANY OIL ANYWHERE  AND THE RESULT WAS NEGATIVE.  I'VE HERD THAT MY MODEL AUDI A4 2.0T 2011 HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE PISTONS  RINGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE OIL CONSUMPTION WAS VERY HIGH.
