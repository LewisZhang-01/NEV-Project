My first thought was a stray bullet shot in the air came down and hit the sunroof.  Thank goodness there wasn't a car near me on the 4 lane road. I was able to pull off on a side street; i was shaking, bawling, and so confused. There was no warning whatsoever, just BAM, explosion.  I called 911, who came out within about 20 minutes.  Upon further investigation, we determined the glass was protruding upwards and out of the car indicating the explosion came from inside the vehicle. We examined the large pieces of glass to see if there were any scratches or dings and found nothing.  I filed the police report, closed the sunshade to drive home without glass falling on me.  Things could have been much worse. I just found out since my car only has 77K miles, the sunroof is still under warranty and will be fixed by Hyundai. Still, something should be done about this as I've been researching, it seems more common than it should!",

All of the sudden while traveling in the second lane her engine lost power and dropped in speed to 20 mph from 65 mph. There were no warning lights, or prior sounds ,vibrations or other symptoms to indicate an issue. She immediately became worried about trying to get the  car off the highway and to a safe place, with out causing or being involve in an accident. She called me scared and didn\u2019t want to drive it any further. After we got the car home, I checked for fouled plugs, bad coil pack, maybe bad fuel in the tank or possibly a bad or stuck injector. None of these had any issues. Our son who works at  Somersworth Hyundai here in New Hampshire,as a salesman, talked to the technician there and he told us to bring the car there and he\u2019d take a look at it. When we heard back from him the technician said that there was no compression in cylinder number 2. My safety concern is that when this the case the injectors continue to dump fuel into the cylinder. Causing excess fuel that doesn\u2019t get combusted in the cylinder to be dumped into the exhaust manifold and out the tail pipe as a heated vapor. The concern is the fumes, the possibility of a fire igniting in the hot exhaust manifold and causing an uncontrollable situation. The technician also said if you take a bore scope you will see that a valve in the head has broken off for cylinder 2 and has caused this issue. The car has been sitting in my garage now for 4-5 months. We still owe on this car and it can\u2019t be safely moved anywhere with out being towed.",

        "summary": "The engine(3.3L) on my vehicle went out. It has well under 100,000 miles on it. I was driving down the highway and the engine just started making a noise and instantly shut down.  There were no check engine lights on or any warning at all. The vehicle wasn't making any noises at all until the moment it shut down without warning. There wasn't any oil pressure lights on or low oil lights or nothing.  The oil was always regularly changed. My family and I are just lucky that we were on a cold, dark, empty highway that night instead of on a busy interstate. If we had been in busy traffic, it would have been a very dangerous situation.    I have called the Hyundai dealership(Crain Hyundai, North Little Rock,AR)where I bought the vehicle from.  I explained to them what was going on. They said there is nothing they can do about it because I'm the second owner of the vehicle.   I called the Hyundai Cooperation and explained the situation to them as well. They gave me a case number and also said there is nothing they can do about it.   I went on the  internet and found that several people have had the same problem with their vehicle engine (3.3L)as me. I also found that Hyundai had done a recall on that same vehicle year, make and  model for the exact same problem.  But their recall was only for the 4 cylinder engine and not for the 6 cylinder engine. I called Hyundai Cooperation back and told them that they needed to add the 6 cylinder engine to their recall as well.  They still insisted that there was nothing they could do.   I think the Hyundai Cooperation needs to fix this problem.  It's very expensive to us consumers of theirs. Someone could also get hurt if their vehicle shut down on them   in heavy traffic or in the wrong place.",

The middle of November I was driving her car from Raleigh nc , we stopped to get gas , then I got to my house and then she drive to her house.  After 20 minutes later she called and her car had stopped on the side of the road. She waited for triple a but no luck so she had to leave on the side of the road. The next day car was towed to garage. They said motor was gone. No warning no nothing.  He told us about a recall 953?? Or something so we towed to Hyundai.  They said she didn\u2019t have a recall so they will not pay for her car to be fixed.  We feel like Hyundai should stay behide this engine. My daughter is a hard working nurse and purchases this car used snd still owes 5,000 and they said they would give her 500.00 for the car.  The car was driving great and no lights ever came on the dash.  Please help me to get in touch with the right people bc I know this all has to do with all the engine problems all Hyundai\u2019s are having.  She did say right before it stopped running some lights came on the dash then it just died. She thought it was just a battery so she tried to get triple about with a battery but they were behide that night and never showed.  The oil had been changed about 3,000 miles when this happened.  Please help us get her car fixed.   Thank you",

The engine with out warning on the dash or any other signs lost the number two cylinder compression and caused the car to have major acceleration issues. As well as raw fuel being dumped into the cylinder and entering into the exhaust manifold. As you can barely breath when standing behind the car or even driving behind it. Her car was taken to a Hyundai dealership after I had seen there was a recall on her motor for a failure of a Nok Sensor. The dealership technician diagnosed the issue and said that there was no compression in the second cylinder due to a valve in the head breaking off. We were told that the repairs would not be covered by a recall and that the cars engine would need to be replaced as the fact that the raw fuel being dumped into the engine destroyed that cylinder. Again no warnings or warning lights, car acceleration was extremely slow and the car shook while trying to get it home safely. I am concerned that in an area where the temperature outside is significantly higher than where we live, that raw fuel could ignite in the exhaust system, as well as cause a vehicle low on fuel to combust due to the vapor of the tank possibly igniting due to to the possible fire in the engine compartment and exhaust system.",

The car was making a bad vibrating rattling noise, and the red oil light came on which prompted immediate diagnostics July 6th, 2021. When they assessed they stated to drive it and check the oil level and on August 2nd I brought the vehicle back and they recommended starting the Hyundai protocol for diagnosing burn of oil due to smoke The Hyundai dealership I have had my car serviced at went through the 1000 mile burn test to diagnose the problem and this was confirmed to be the issued September 10th, 2021. Hyundai states that engine is under warranty but will only repair (or replace) the engine if the engine undergoes a catastrophic failure involving the bearings. This seems highly dangerous and illegal. If the engine burns too much oil the engine will seize. When the engine seizes, this could cause the operator to lose control of the vehicle causing harm to the driver, passengers, or others on the public roadway. I have contacted Hyundai corporate headquarters about this, though links provided on their website are broken and make it difficult to get clear answers. I have done the required maintenance and have records to prove this. However I am VERY FRUSTRATED AND SCARED. My engine has not seized or failed yet, but if this issue is not resolved, it WILL fail. When the manufacturer knows this issue exists, and when the consumer proactively maintains their vehicle, brings it into the dealership to be told \u201cto drive it and let it catastrophically fail\u201d for Hyundai to acknowledge their warranty is unethical and if not illegal, it should be.

A few days later, the issue happened again. Took it back. They could not determine the problem and said we should bring it to the local Hyundai dealership in Naples, FL. Hyundai dealership in Naples, FL swore up and down it was the brake pedal assembly. Trusted their judgment and replaced it. Not even a few days later, car goes back into limp mode. Take it back to the local Hyundai dealership. They swear up and down it is now the tracking device on the vehicle. So between the warranty company, the dealership we bought the car from and the local Hyundai dealership we get the tracking device reinstalled. We take the car not even a few days later car goes back into limp mode. We dealt with this issue since May 2020-September 2020 at the local Hyundai dealership. They finally disconnected the tracking device. Now mind you the limp mode issues with the vehicle only happen when it is raining. In our dry season we experience no issues. Fast forward to June 2021 limp mode issues have returned since we are now in our rainy season. Local Hyundai dealership swore up and down again it is the tracking device. I had advised them it is impossible since they unplugged it and this issue only happens in the rain. They still swore it was the tracking device. They finally got the vehicle really wet and they finally were able to see what we were talking about. So now they changed their professional opinion that it is the wiring harness. Apparently this vehicle has two different wiring harnesses. So they are suggesting we replace both, but they can't guarantee that will work. So it appears they really do not know what is wrong with the car. If it was truly wiring then why would it only malfunction in the rain and not when it is dry? How is rain getting getting under the hood and through the protective component",

WHEN THE TECH REMOVED THE CYLINDER HEAD 6 OF THE REAR HEAD BOLTS WERE LOOSE AND THE THREADS HAD PULLED OUT OF THE BLOCK AND 4 FROM THE FRONT HEAD. TECH DRILLED OUT ALL REAR BLOCK HEAD BOLT HOLES AND INSTALLED TIME SERTS AND THE 4 IN THE FRONT HEAD. AFTER REPAIR NO MORE OIL LEAKS. I CALLED HYUNDAI CORPORATE  BECAUSE OF THERE DESIGN FAILURE IT WAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR IT $4526.02. AGAIN HYUNDAI SAID THEY WERE NOT LIABLE.

I WAS IN GEORGIA WITH MY TWO PREMATURE TWINS THE TEMPERATURE WAS 101 AND NO AIR! I HAD TO STOP EVERY FEW MINUTES, TURN OFF THE CAR, WAIT THEN TURN IT ON AGAIN. I MAY ONLY GET 10 MILES AND I WOULD HAVE TO STOP AGAIN. I HAD TO MAKE UNEXPECTED HOTEL RESERVATIONS AND LEFT THE CAR AT A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR 2 DAYS TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIX IT. THEY WERE NOT ABLE THEY COULDN?T FIND THE PROBLEM.  WE STARTED BACK HOME A 500 MILE TRIP IN 101  DEGREE. WITH 2 PREMATURE BABIES NO LESS THAN 5 MILES DOWN THE ROAD.... IT STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN! THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER OF MY 2003 SANTA FE. I ASSUMED IT MUST HAVE BEEN A FLUKE...OBVIOUSLY NOT! BECAUSE SADLY  HERE I AM AGAIN! CAN YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME OF THE STEPS I SHOULD TAKE NEXT? THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP! I WILL LIST THE FIRST DATE IT OCCURRED. IT CONTINUES TO OCCUR.  *TR",

I FOUND THE RECALL PAPERWORK AND TRIED TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIR, IN MARCH 2014. THEY STILL DID NOT HAVE THE PART.  MY MOM CALLED AGAIN IN APRIL. THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PART.  MY MOM OPENED A CASE NUMBER WITH HUYNDAI AT THAT TIME.  I HAVE JUST CALLED TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIR AND THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE A PART.  THEY SAY IT IS A NATIONAL BACK ORDER.  MY COMPLAINT IS HOW CAN SOMETHING THAT IS RECALLED WITH A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH NO REPLACEMENT PART FOR 8+ MONTHS?  THIS IS NOT A WINDOW THAT WILL NOT ROLL DOWN.  BASED ON THE INFORMATION I CAN FIND THERE ARE 20,000 VEHICLES THAT HAVE THIS ISSUE AND IN 8 MONTHS THEY CAN'T SEEM TO SUPPLY ADEQUATE REPLACEMENT PARTS.  WHILE THE RECALL HAS NOT INDICATED ANY DEATHS, I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE OF HOW THE ISSUE IS EXPLAINED. IT OCCURS SUDDENLY, AND THE DRIVER WILL LOSE ABILITY TO STEER.  MY MOTHER IS NOT SOMEONE, WHO WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THIS CAR IF THIS OCCURS.  I WOULD BE HAPPY IF THIS WOULD JUST GET TAKEN CARE OF BUT THE SERVICE MANAGER AT RED HOAGLAND AND THE CASE WORKER AT HYUNDAI JUST SAY SORRY BUT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. AT THIS POINT MY MOM DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SHE CAN DRIVE THE CAR ANY DISTANCE FOR FEAR THAT THIS ISSUE WILL ARISE.  IS HYUNDAI NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO GET THESE PARTS AND KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS INFORMED AND SAFE.  8 MONTHS OF BACK ORDER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR THIS ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED?  *TR",

MY MAIN COMPLAINT CONSISTS OF OPERATING A VERY UNSTABLE VEHICLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IT WANDERS, SURGES, AND GENERALLY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN. I CONSTANTLY FIND MYSELF TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE BLASTS OF WIND THAT JOSTLES MY VEHICLE FROM SIDE-TO-SIDE, ONLY TO REALIZE IT'S A PERFECTLY STILL DAY. DRIVING PAST OTHER VEHICLES OR HAVING OTHER VEHICLES PASS ME CAUSES INSTABILITY AND IS A CHALLENGE TO KEEP IN THE LANE.   IN SUPPORT OF THE STEERING ISSUE, IT IS NON-LINEAR, UNPREDICTABLE, AND FEELS DISCONNECTED FROM THE FRONT WHEELS. ADDITIONALLY, WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL BEING ROTATED, THE VEHICLE WILL MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS THAT ARE UNEXPECTED, INCONSISTENT WITH STEERING ANGLE, AND FEEL UNSAFE ON ALL ROAD SURFACES.   MY PURCHASING DEALERSHIP TRIED TO BLAME THE STEERING ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ROADS ARE NOT 100% LEVEL, FLAT, SMOOTH, ETC.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING MANY DIFFERENT CARS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER OWNED A VEHICLE THAT FEELS UNSAFE IN ALL DRIVING CONDITIONS - AS IF IT WERE ON ICE!    IT IS VERY TIRING TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ON LONG TRIPS AS IT DEMANDS CONSTANT CORRECTIONS TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN THE LANE. ON STRAIGHT, LEVEL ROADS, THE VEHICLE WANDERS TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. HIGHER SPEEDS MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE.  I HAVE TAKEN MY 2013 SANTA FE SPORT TO BE FIXED ON MORE THAN 4 OCCASIONS AND NO REALIGNMENT, SOFTWARE UPDATE, TIRE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT OR RELATED ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CORRECTING THE STEERING/HANDLING PROBLEMS OF MY VEHICLE.",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR A CHECK UP.  AFTER A PRELIMINARY CHECK, THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO ERROR CODE.

I WAS ABLE TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM BY USING THE POWER ADJUSTMENT TO RAISE THE SEAT TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POSITION. WHILE NOT A SOLUTION, IT MINIMIZED THE PROBLEM AND ALLOWED ME TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR. AFTER PERUSING A NUMBER OF ONLINE HYUNDAI FORUMS, I DISCOVERED THAT A NUMBER OF 2013 SF OWNER'S WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY EITHER REPLACING THE SEAT/SEAT RAILS OR BY USING A SPECIALLY-DESIGNED TOOL TO CORRECT TOO MUCH CLEARANCE/PLAY IN THE SLIDING SEAT TRACKS. I BROUGHT THIS INFO TO THE ATTENTION OF MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHEN IT WAS RECENTLY TIME FOR THE FIRST SERVICE. AFTER SHARING INFO WITH THEM AND EVEN GIVING THEM A COPY OF A COMPLETED SERVICE ORDER FROM A FRIEND ON ONE OF THE ONLINE FORUMS, TO MY ASTONISHMENT THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO FIX MY SEAT. THE DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER REFUSED TO AUTHORIZE THIS REPAIR BECAUSE AS HE PUT IT. \"I SAT IN A FEW 2013 SF'S AND THEY ALL DID IT\". THE EXCUSE OF SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO AVOID ADMITTING THERE IS A PROBLEM. JUST BECAUSE THEY ALL DO IT DOES NOT MEAN THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM AS EVIDENCED BY THE INFO I EASILY DISCOVERED ON THE INTERNET. HYUNDAI HAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED OTHER REPAIRS FOR OTHER OWNERS. I THINK THAT NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS AND FORCE HYUNDAI TO COME CLEAN AND AUTHORIZE THESE REPAIRS FOR ALL OWNERS REGARDLESS OF LOCATION OR DEALER/DISTRICT.  *TR",

IT FEELS LIKE THE ENGINE HAS STALLED, BUT HASN'T. CONTINUING TO PUSH DOWN BRINGS NO RESULT. AFTER APPROXIMATELY A 2 TO 5 SECOND DELAY, THE RPMS BEGIN TO BUILD UP RAPIDLY. THE FIRST TWO OR THREE TIMES IT HAPPENED I SUDDENLY SURGED FORWARD IN A VERY DANGEROUS MANNER. THE REAL PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IS THAT WITH FOLLOWING TRAFFIC EXPECTING ME TO ACCELERATE AND CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE AND I SUDDENLY STOP ACCELERATING WITHOUT HAVING APPLIED BRAKES, THUS ACTIVATING BRAKE LIGHTS, THERE IS A REAR END COLLISION WAITING TO HAPPEN.   HERE IS AN EXAMPLE FROM LAST NIGHT. I WAS ROLLING SLOWLY IN A LEFT TURN LANE, FOOT OFF THE GAS, WAITING FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC TO CLEAR. IT DID AND I BEGIN THE TURN SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESSING DOWN ON THE PEDAL--NO RESPONSE. LET UP AND PRESSED DOWN AGAIN--NO RESPONSE. I LET UP AGAIN, RPMS CAME UP, I PRESSED DOWN AGAIN AND PROCEED NORMALLY INTO A PARKING LOT. I WAS PERPENDICULAR TO 3 LANES OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND DEAD IN THE WATER FOR MAYBE 3 TO 5 SECONDS. ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED WHILE ACCELERATING OUT OF A U TURN AND ALSO COMING OUT OF A SLOW RIGHT TURN. IT HAPPENED WHILE ACCELERATING SLOWLY THROUGH AN OPENING SECURITY GATE.   I HAVE LEFT THE CAR WITH THE DEALER OVERNIGHT SO THEY COULD DRIVE IT AND HOOK IT UP TO THEIR ERROR CODE MACHINES. THEY COULD NOT OBSERVE THE ISSUE OR DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.
