        "summary": "Friday October 8th 2021, my truck shut off in the middle of Chesnee SC within 1/4 mile after filling up with diesel fuel at the Hot Spot in Chesnee. I had it towed to Burns Chevrolet in Gaffney SC for analysis. They determine it was the result of contamination in the fuel and that is not a warranty issue. I would agree that is not the responsibility of Chevrolet and I authorized them to make the repairs. They did what you would normally expect with the exception of one thing. They came back and said they had to replace the fuel transfer line between the fuel tanks. Said it was kinked. I questioned how water in the fuel could cause that to happen but they said the contamination was the root cause and I had to pay to fix that as well. I requested a sample of the contamination and all parts replaced. That charge was included on the invoice and I paid it. There are other issues with the quality of the service which included returning the next day because the water contamination light came on again. They had to bleed the newly installed fuel filter there in the parking lot and the light went off. When I got home and inspected the replaced parts, I found that the fuel transfer line not only was kinked, but also ruptured. I just retired from an OEM as a quality specialist, and many of my parts were safety critical. I would be willing to bet that the Tier 1 supplier does not have a ruptured fuel line ranked very high on their FEMA plan due to the probability of water causing a kink little on a rupture, but according to the Chevrolet technician that was the root cause, so they own it. I called Chevrolet corporate and informed them of my plan to report this incident. They opened an incident report, but failed to take any action to address my concerns. You will find when you check the dealers repairs to this vehicle, it has had several issues related to fuel problems. Due to space limitations on this page, I cannot tell you the whole story.  Contact me and I can explain furthe",

DURING THE INVESTIGATION, THE CHEVROLET  SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOCATED IN VALLEY STREAM, NY STATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 2016 THAT THE ENTIRE ELECTRIC RACK OPINION FOR THE POWER STEERING WAS DEFECTED WHEN IT WAS INSTALLED DURING THE ASSEMBLY BY THE MANUFACTURE.
