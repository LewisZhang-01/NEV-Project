AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF SITTING IN THE CAR WITH THE IGNITION OFF, THE CAR DINGS ABOUT 6 TIMES.  NO LIGHTS ARE ON, NOT EVEN THE SECURITY LIGHT, (NOTHING THAT IS INDICATIVE TO A MALFUNCTION).  IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE.  WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A FRIEND'S SHOP, THE FUEL PUMP TESTED FINE.  HE CAME UP WITH A PASSLOCK ISSUE, AND TOLD ME THAT IF THAT IS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR.  THIS CAR HAS DRIVEN QUITE WELL FOR MONTHS UP UNTIL YESTERDAY.  IF YOU LET IT SIT FOR 30 MINUTES TO AN HOUR IT WILL START RIGHT UP BUT THEN DIE AGAIN WITHIN 10-15 MINUTES.  THERE IS NO BLINKING SECURITY LIGHT, NO DIAGNOSTICS SHOWING THAT ANYTHING IS WRONG PERIOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A POSSIBLE PASSLOCK ISSUE.  I CANNOT RISK DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  I AM MISSING WORK BECAUSE OF THIS, ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT I WILL HAVE SOME KIND OF REPAIR COST, AND NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE IS, AM AFRAID I WILL BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IF I GO TO A DEALER THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

WHEN I TRY TO ROLL IT DOWN, IT WILL PULL DOWN THE ENGINE AND MY LIGHTS WILL DIM VERY LOW.( EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR LIGHTS.) MY BACK SPEAKERS ALSO WORK WHENEVER THEY WANT TO. I AM NOT ONE TO LISTEN TO LOUD MUSIC, BUT IT'S PRETTY BAD WHEN ONLY THE FRONT SPEAKERS WORK. I BELIEVE THESE CARS NEED TO BE REWIRED. THE LATEST PROBLEM HAPPENED ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO. THE TRANSMISSION LEVER BUTTON COMPLETELY BROKE OFF. LUCKILY THE BUTTON IS STILL \"LITERALLY\" HANGING IN THERE ,BUT IF IT FALLS OUT AND GETS LOST THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO PUT MY CAR INTO GEAR OR OUT OF GEAR FOR THAT MATTER. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BUTTON TO PUT THE CAR INTO PARK. THE DEALER WHOM I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM IS NOT WILLING TO HELP AT ALL WITH ANY OF THE SITUATIONS WITH MY CAR.

ON INVESTIGATION IT WAS NOTED THAT THE RIGHT REAR TIRE THAT HAD COME OFF WAS STILL INTACT MEANING NO BLOW OUT AND LUG NUTS WERE STILL IN PLACE BUT ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE TIRE YOU COULD SEE WHERE THE SPINDLE HAD SEPARTED FROM THE STRUT HOUSING CAUSING THE TIRE TO COME OFF THE CAR.  ALSO, ON THE LEFT REAR OF THE CAR. THAT TIRE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CAR BUT PULLED UP AND AWAY FROM ITS ATTACHMENT WITH THE SAME DEFECT NOTED AT THE SPINDLE SEPARATION FROM THE STRUT HOUSING.  I HAVE PICTURES OF ALL THESE DETAILS AND HAVE HAD SEVERAL CERTIFIED TECHNICIANS LOOK AT THE CAR AND THEY  HAVE ALL COME UP WITH THE SAME CONSENSUS THAT THE SEPARATION OF THIS SPINDLE FROM THE STRUT HOUSING IS WHAT MADE THE TIRE COME OFF AND THUS CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VECHILE AND TOTAL LOSS OF THE VEHICLE AS DEEMED SO BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY.  I SUFFERED 2 FRACTURED RIBS, A RUPTURED TENDON OF THE AC JOINT IN MY LEFT SHOULDER AND BACK PAIN THAT I AM CURRENTLY BEING TREATED FOR.  I AM OUT ON DISABILITY BECAUSE OF THESE INJURIES.

REGARDLESS OF WHAT EVER IS HAPPENING TO THE BRAKES AT THIS POINT, THE CAR WILL STOP.  IT IS WITHIN GM'S SPECIFICATIONS THEREFORE IT IS \"NORMAL.\"    IF THE CAR HAS GONE FROM NORMAL BRAKING TO SCRAPING TO GRINDING AND GRABBING WHAT WILL ANOTHER 6 MONTHS, A YEAR, 2 YEARS BRING?

IF THE BRAKES AREN'T REPLACED EVERY 10,000 MILES OR LESS, HOW MANY MILES BEFORE THE BRAKES ACTUALLY FAIL AND SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED.  SOUND FAMILIAR?  FORD-FIRESTONE.

WHY THE SERVICE TECHS AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM WON'T STAND UP FOR US WHO ARE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS AND TELL GM THAT \"HEY SOMETING IS WRONG WITH THESE CARS.\"  IS TOTALLY BEYOND ME.
