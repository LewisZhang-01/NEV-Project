THIS ISSUE HAS OCCURRED IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER, INCLUDING RAINY DAYS AND DRY DAYS, SO THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SORT OF IMPACT ON THE ISSUE. WHEN THE POWER STEERING LOCKS UP THE VEHICLE THROWS AROUND 50 CODES, WHICH THE DEALERSHIP HAS RESET MORE THAN ONCE. EACH TIME THE STEERING LOCKS UP I HAVE TO SLAM ON MY BREAKS AND TURN MY CAR ON AND OFF MULTIPLE TIMES UNTIL THE STEERING STARTS WORKING AGAIN. I HAVE TAKEN MY JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE - ON 11/30/2019 AND TODAY (12/29/2019) - AND HAVE CALLED MANY, MANY TIMES TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED. NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE OR KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I PICKED MY JEEP UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SECOND TIME EARLIER TODAY, AND MY STEERING COMPLETELY LOCKED UP AGAIN AFTER DRIVING IT 20 MILES. THIS TIME NOT ONLY DID THE STEERING COMPLETELY LOCK UP, BUT THE BREAKS WERE MALFUNCTIONING AS WELL. EACH TIME I TAKE MY JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY CLAIM THAT THE ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE SWAY BAR DISCONNECT, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. BASED ON MY RESEARCH THERE AND MANY, MANY STOCK 2019 WRANGLERS THAT ARE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. IF THIS ISSUE ISN'T TAKEN CARE OF WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, SOMEONE IS GOING TO END UP LOSING THEIR LIFE. I AM TIRED OF GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP AND BEING PUSHED OUT THE DOOR EACH TIME BEING TOLD THAT THE ISSUE IS FIXED WHEN IT CLEARLY ISN'T. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS ISSUE TO GET RESOLVED?",
