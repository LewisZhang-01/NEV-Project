        "summary": "The driver door handle stopped functioning on a 7-year-old low milage (<25k) Mazda 5. The malfunction is common among Mazda's and can be easily found when searching the internet. A small groove on the internal door handle mechanism breaks off and lets the spring pulling the handle back slip out.  In most cases, this causes the door to be unable to open (from the outside or inside). However, in my case, the door would not latch closed anymore. Having a driver side door not close while driving is a safety issue and a vehicle where the door does not stay closed should not be operated. This problem is known to Mazda and a recall was issued for certain Mazda models in the past - but not for the 2014 Mazda 5.  (see this web-site for a description: https://www.realmazdaparts.com/blog/mazda-door-handle-problems)  This issue came up without warning, leaving us on a trip with a door that was suddenly not latching closed anymore. Therefore, this is a safety hazard that may arise on any moment and Mazda should address it by replacing the internal part of the door handle with one that is not subject to premature failure.",
