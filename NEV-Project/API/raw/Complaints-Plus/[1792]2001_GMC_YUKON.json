IT WAS GOOD THAT I WASN'T GOING FASTER. WHEN I TOOK MY TRUCK ( YOUKON ) TO THE REPAIR SHOP I EXPLAINED THE ISSUE TO THE REPAIR MAN. I GOT HOME AND HE CALLED ME BACK AND ASKED ME TO RETURN TO THE SHOP TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE TRUCKS PROBLEMS. WHEN RETURNING TO THE SHOP THE TRUCK WAS LIFTED UP AND HE SHOWED ME THE BRAKE LINES AND THE GAS LINES THAT WERE CORRODED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . HE ALSO EXPLAINED THE TIME AND LABOR INVOLVED. I WAS SURPRISED OF HOW MUCH LABOR AND TIME WAS INVOLVED TO REPAIR THESE ISSUES . HE SAID THE COST INCLUDING PARTS AND LABOR WILL BE ABOUT 2,500. TO 3,000. DOLLARS, THAT IS IF HE DIDN'T COME ACROSS ANY OTHER PROBLEMS.  *TR",

I STARTED LOOKING FOR A PULLOFF AS I WAS ON A COUNTRY ROAD. AS I FOUND ONE FIRE STARTED COMING UP THROUGH THE GAPS. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT I HAD A FIRE THAT WAS GOING TO DESTROY THE VEHICLE. SO, ONCE I WAS STOPPED I LOOKED FOR MY FIRE EXTINGUISHER BUT COULDN'T FIND IT AND THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD BOTTLED WATER IN THE VEHICLE. I GRABBED 4 OF THEM AND WENT BACK TO THE DRIVERS SIDE AND BEGAN TO POUR WATER DOWN THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE CONSOLE THAT HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE FIRE MELTING IT. THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT QUICKLY. I THEN PUT ON GLOVES AND REMOVED THE TOP PART OF THE CONSOLE THAT HAD BEEN MOSTLY DESTROYED BY THE FIRE. IN LOOKING INTO THE BOTTOM IT APPEARS THAT SMALL BITS OF PAPER, RECEIPTS, ETC. HAD FALLEN DOWN ONTO THE WIRING HARNESS BELOW. MY GUESS IS THAT SINCE I HAD PLUGGED MY XM RADIO INTO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER IT HAD HEATED UP THE WIRES WHICH HAD HEATED UP THE PAPERS UNTIL THEY BEGAN TO BURN. I CONSIDER THIS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE CONSOLE, THE CAUSE BEING THE CRACKS IN THE CONSOLE/ASH TRAY WHICH WOULD ALLOW PAPER OBJECTS TO FALL ONTO THE WIRING HARNESS BELOW AND CAUSE A FIRE. THE FIRE MELTED ABOUT SIX INCHES OF INSULATION OFF THE WIRING HARNESS AND THE WIRES TOUCHING EACH OTHER RESULTED IN FUSES BEING BLOWN. THE VEHICLE IS STILL DRIVABLE BUT AS OF THIS WRITING DOES NOT HAVE OVERHEAD LIGHTS AND DASHBOARD LIGHTING AVAILABLE & THEIR IS AN INTERMITTENT IGNITION ISSUE.

WE WERE CLEANING THE REAR OF OUR VEHICLE WHEN THE VEHICLE CAME OUT OF GEAR AND THE PARKING BRAKE FAILED TO HOLD THE VEHICLE.  MY 2 YEAR OLD SON WAS IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME, BUT THERE IS NO WAY THAT HE COULD HAVE APPLIED THE BRAKE TO RELEASE THE VEHICLE OUT OF GEAR.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE AND I AM ASKING FOR HELP IN PROVING THESE FAILURES.  I FEEL THERE ARE TWO FAILURES WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THE PARKING BRAKE ON ALL MODELS OF THESE VEHICLES FAILS TO HOLD THESE VEHICLES.  I HAVE SEARCHED YOUR WEBSITES TO FIND 50 PLUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PARKING BRAKE ON GMC/CHEVROLET VEHICLES OF THIS KIND FAILING TO HOLD THE VEHICLE AND VEHICLES NOT PASSING SAFETY INSPECTIONS BECAUSE THE PARKING BRAKE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE VEHICLE.  THE SECOND ISSUE IS I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS EITHER A MALFUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION OR THAT THERE ARE MECHANICAL OVERRIDES IN THIS VEHICLE AS IN THE 2003 GMC ENVOY RECALL CAMPAIGN #03V075 THAT CAN ALLOW THE TRANSMISSION TO BE SHIFTED OUT OF PARK WITH THE IGNITION IN THE OFF POSITION.   I ALSO, I FOUND ODI ID NUMBER: 897722 WHICH SHOWS THAT THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  I BELIEVE A FULL INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE ON THE PARKING BRAKE AND THE TRANSMISSION OF THE GMC AND CHEVROLET VEHICLES.   THIS IS THE LINK TO  THE ACCIDENT.

GM HAS WRITTEN, INDICATING THAT THERE IS A \"STANDARD\" DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS NOT.  GM HAS MADE AN APPARENT MISREPRESENTATION, FOOLING CUSTOMERS INTO BELIEVING THAT THE COURTESY DOME LIGHT SYSTEM (WHICH TURNS ON WHEN THE DOOR IS OPEN) IS A DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM.   I HAVE SEEN OTHER  INTERNET COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS SYSTEM IN GM PRODUCTS.  IT POSES A GRAVE DANGER TO OCCUPANTS.  IS THERE LEGISLATION REGARDING A DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM AND CAN ANYTHING BE DONE ABOUT GM?  BELOW ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT  CAN OR HAS OCCURRED. A DRIVER ENTERS A YUKON ALONG WITH THREE PASSENGERS.  THE DOME  LIGHT WILL TURN ON NO MATTER WHAT AT THIS JUNCTURE BECAUSE THE DOORS WERE  OPENED, SO THERE WOULD NOT BE CAUSE FOR ALARM AS DOORS CLOSE.  ONE OF THE  THREE PASSENGERS DOES NOT CLOSE HIS/HER DOOR COMPLETELY.  THE DRIVER PUTS  THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND STARTS THE VEHICLE.  THE LIGHT TURNS OFF.  NO DOOR AJAR WARNING.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE:  I OPENED A REAR PASSENGER DOOR OF MY YUKON AND THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THE DOME LIGHT TURNED ON, BECAUSE IT IS APPARENTLY A STANDARD FEATURE FOR THE LIGHT TO COME ON WHEN A DOOR IS OPENED FOR PEOPLE TO GET IN AND OUT.  I THEN PUSHED THE PASSENGER DOOR TOWARDS IT'S HOUSING JUST ENOUGH FOR METAL TO TOUCH METAL (OR THE APPARENT SENSOR), BUT STILL \"OPEN\" IN THAT, WITHOUT ENGAGING THE DOOR OPENING MECHANISM, I COULD STILL PULL IT OPEN.  I THEN ENTERED THE VEHICLE  THROUGH THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND CLOSED IT (ONLY THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR).  I PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND THE DOME LIGHT TURNED OF. ANYONE COULD  HAVE PUSHED OR PULLED THE PASSENGER DOOR OPEN.  EXAMPLE: I BEGAN BACKING OUT OF MY HOUSE ONE DAY WHEN ONE OF THE DOORS BEGAN TO OPEN.  NO DOOR AJAR LIGHT WAS ON.  HAD THIS OCCURRED ON THE OPEN ROAD, A SERIOUS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE RESULTED.  THE DOORS ON THIS SUV ARE ALREADY HEAVY, AND IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE A DOOR AJAR.*AK",

THE NOISE KEPT GETTING LOUDER DURING A 6 HOUR TRIP. UPON RETURNING TO TOWN WE TOOK IT INTO TUFFY AUTO SERVICE CENTER IN PORT CHARLOTTE. WE TOLD THEM WE THOUGHT IT WAS A BEARING  NOISE AND TO PLEASE CHECK IT OUT. THEY HAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO PUT IT ON THE LIFT AND PUT IN GEAR AND REALIZED IT WAS THE REAR END. WE IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO MARLOW-WERNER AND TOLD THEM WHAT TUFFY HAD SAID. THEY CHECKED OUT THE VEHICLE AND TOLD US THE COMPLETE REAR END NEEDED TO BE REDONE. THE BEARINGS WERE SCORED AND THEY HAD TO REPLACE ALL THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL BEARINGS, PINION, AND SIDE BEARINGS. I HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE SERVICED AT THE DEALER EVERY 3K MILES AS PER MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATIONS. I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A NEW VEHICLE WITH 40K MILES HAVE THE REAR END GO OUT THIS WAY.

THEY REPAIRED THE VEHICLE AND TOLD ME THAT THE WIPERS ON THIS VEHICLE SOMETIMES DO THAT, IN FACT HE SAID HE HAD ALREADY REPAIRED TWO THAT SAME DAY AND I SHOULD CARRY A 13MM WRENCH WITH ME AND CHECK THE TIGHTNESS ON THE ARMS FROM TIME TO TIME. THE NEXT INCIDENT HAPPENED IN APRIL AND IT WAS MISTING RAIN, I HAD JUST TURNED ON MY WIPERS WHEN I SAW THE LEFT FRONT WIPER ARM COME LOSE AND STOPPED WIPING. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE WIPERS OFF BEFORE IT GOT TANGLED UP WITH THE RIGHT WIPER ARM. I USED THE 13MM WRENCH, THAT THE DEALER RECOMMENED I BUY, AND TIGHTENED IT.

I AM TOWING A 26' HI-LO TRAVEL TRAILER THAT IS CONSIDERABLY LESS WEIGHT THAN THE GMC HITCH IS DESIGNED FOR.  I HAVE PULLED THIS SAME TRAILER WITH THE SAME TRAILER HITCH BALL, TORSION BARS, SWAY BARS PULLING IT WITH MY 1997 FORD EXPLORER.  THE TRAILER HITCH RECEIVER NEVER BENT LIKE THE GMC RECEIVER HITCH DID ON MY FIRST TRIP TO CANADA.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, MR. HOLZHAVER, AND SHOWED HIM BOTH THE GMC BENT RECEIVER HITCH AND THE FORD EXPLORER UNDAMAGED RECEIVER HITCH. HE REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TRAILER HITCH AND SAID IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE FACTORY WARRANTY. THE DESIGN OF THIS TRAILER RECEIVER HITCH IS UNSAFE AND SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BEND UP 3 INCHES WHEN THE TORSION BARS ARE INSTALLED. IF THE HITCH BREAKS LOOSE THIS 26' TRAILER COULD COME LOOSE CAUSING A DEVASTATING ACCIDENT ON OUR HIGHWAYS.

WHEN RAISING THE VEHICLE ON THE LIFT THEY FOUND FOUR CRACKED WELDS WHICH THEY REPAIRED AND ATTACHED SOME ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO THE FRAME IN ORDER TO TRANSFER MORE WEIGHT TO THE FRONT AXLE. PRIOR TO THIS MODIFICATION I WAS REDUCING THE FRONT AXLE LOAD BY 600#, WHICH MADE THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE LIGHT. I BELIEVE THIS RECEIVER IS OVER RATED AND VERY DANGEROUS. THIS FACTORY RECEIVER IS RATED AT 12000# TRAILER WEIGHT AND 1500# TONGUE WEIGHT WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE OVER RATED. IT ALSO DOES NOT TRANSFER THE WEIGHT EVENLY OVER THE VEHICLE AS IT SHOULD. I AM TOWING A 9000# TRAILER WITH A HITCH WEIGHT OF 1200#. IT APPEARS THAT THE GM PRIORTY IS SELLING YUKON'S AND INCLUDING A RECEIVER FROM THE LOWEST BIDDER.
