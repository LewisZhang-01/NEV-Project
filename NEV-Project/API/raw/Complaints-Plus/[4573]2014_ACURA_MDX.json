THE TRAFFIC LINES ARE VERY FAINT AND UNREADABLE TO WHERE TOO MUCH TIME IS SPENT TRYING TO SEE TRAFFIC WHILE DRIVING.  THIS WILL RESULT IN ACCIDENTS DUE TO DIVERTED ATTENTION.

THE OTHER CAR HIT US SO HARD IT WAS TOTALED.  THIS VISUAL ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED EITHER AS A RECALL OR BY AN OPTIONAL UPDATE. THE 2017 NAV DISK UPDATE I TRIED FROM ACURA DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE.

LATER IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE LEFT FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW PANELS WERE WARPED.  DIDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF A FUSS ABOUT EITHER ISSUE, BUT IN THE SUMMER OF 2015, WHILE RUNNING MY CAR THROUGH A CAR WASH, THE PANEL POPPED OFF AND BEGAN FLAPPING IN THE WIND.  RETURNED VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP AND THE WINDOW PANEL WAS REPLACED.  AT THIS TIME, I ALSO INFORMED THEM THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEGUN TO START EXHIBITING ISSUES UPON ACCELERATION LIKE IT WAS STRUGGLING TO GAIN POWER.

STEERING WHEEL HAND SENSOR ? COMPUTER APPLIED OVER-STEER FORCES THE CAR LEFT OR RIGHT SEVERAL DEGREES DEPENDING ON HAND POSITION.   IDS: THREE SETTINGS FORCE STEERING WHEEL SEVERAL DEGREES LEFT OR RIGHT DURING BRAKING DEPENDING ON LAST APPLIED STEERING ADJUSTMENT.  WHEN THE ROAD IS A COMBINATION OF CURVED, SUBSTANTIALLY SLOPED, OR BUMPY THE COMPUTER WILL APPLY MAXIMUM COMPUTERIZED TURNING FORCE TO MOVE STEERING WHEEL UP TO 45 DEGREES LEFT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC EVEN WHEN THE ROAD SLOPES AND/OR CURVES AWAY FROM ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  A SERIES OF SOFTWARE COMMAND CONFLICTS AND OVERRIDES BETWEEN IDS, STEERING WHEEL POSITION SENSOR, STEERING WHEEL SENSOR FOR HAND POSITION, RADAR, AND ROAD POSITION SENSOR, AND OTHER-VEHICLE SENSORS ROUTINELY CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO PERFORM UNINTENDED DRIVE INTO INCOMING TRAFFIC WITH MAXIMUM COMPUTER APPLIED FORCE.  MANUFACTURER REFUSED TO PROVIDE DEALERS COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT THAT ALIGNS STEERING WHEEL SENSOR WITH NAVIGATION COMPUTER, RADAR, INTERNAL/EXTERNAL SENSORS, IDS, AND STEERING WHEEL HAND SENSOR UNLESS THE CONSUMER IS WILLING TO PAY $700 IN EQUIPMENT TRANSFER COSTS. MANUFACTURER DEMANDS DEALERS DENY SERVICE OR AVOID WRITING WORK ORDERS THAT CONTAIN ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM WITH STEERING WHEEL SENSOR, RADAR, COMPUTER-INTEGRATED HARDWARE, OR IDS.  INSTEAD VERBALIZE COMPUTER-RELATED ISSUES WITH REPAIR TECHS TO AVOID REGULATORY REPORTING AND CALIFORNIA LEMON LAW REQUIREMENTS.  *TR",
