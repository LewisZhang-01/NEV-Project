THE SECOND PROBLEM IS WITH THE SHIFTING OF THE TRANSMISSION ( AUTOMATIC) WHEN COLD OR HOT. WHEN COLD GOING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE THE CAR HAS A \" DEAD\" ZONE BEFORE IT WILL ENGAGE INTO DRIVE. THESE FEW SECONDS THAT I WAIT FOR IT TO ENGAGE HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS IN TRAFFIC, WHICH I FEEL WILL RESULT IN A ACCIDENT. WHEN IT DOES ENGAGE IT SHIFTS VERY ABRUPTLY OR BASICALLY \"LUNGING \" INTO DRIVE. THE FACTORY REP. EVEN SAID THE NATURE OF THE CAR SHIFTING THE WAY IT DOES IS NORMAL. UPON EXITING THE H/WAY IF THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO SEND THE SIGNAL FROM THE COMPUTER TO THE TRANSMISSION, IT SEARCHES FOR THE SIGNAL OR ABRUPTLY SHIFTS INTO DRIVE OR HANGS IN A SEMI NEUTRAL \"ZONE\" BEFORE ENGAGING.
