IT CONTINUED AFTER THAT VISIT AND AFTER SHAMING CHRYSLER ON TWITTER, THEY OPTED TO REPLACE THE MOTOR. THE PROBLEM IS THIS CAR SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING. THE ENGINES ARE THE SAME AND THIS PROBLEM WILL KILL SOMEONE. THE AUTO IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A LOW OIL LIGHT AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO CHECK OIL EVERY MONTH!   I AM PICKING THE CAR UP TODAY WITH AN ENGINE THAT IS NEW TO THIS CAR BUT, I AM PETRIFIED TO DRIVE IT. IF IT SHUTS OFF ON THE FREEWAY, HOW AM I TO GET OVER BEFORE I GET HIT. CHRYSLER STATES THAT IS NO PROBLEM IF THIS ENGINE IS FAULTY BECAUSE THEY WILL COVER UNDER WARRANTY.   WHAT WILL IT TAKE-SOMEONE DYING? I DO NOT WANT TO BE THAT PERSON.   SINCE I AM GOING TO GET THIS DEATH TRAP I CALLED TO MAKE SURE THEY FIXED THE CRUISE CONTROL. DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THE CAR IS NOT ON RECALL. FROM ALL MY RESEARCH ALL 200'S ARE ON RECALL. SO, NOW I HAVE A CAR THAT WILL TURN OFF WHEN THE OIL GETS LOW (WITH NO WARNING LIGHT TO TELL YOU OIL IS LOW) AND I CANNOT USE THE CRUISE CONTROL.",
