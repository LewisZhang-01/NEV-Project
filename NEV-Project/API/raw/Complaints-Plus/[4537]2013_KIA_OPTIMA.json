Kia of Janesville and Madison refused to give me any help trying to get the car diagnosed or repaired.   I have spent $700 getting the car towed, storage, and two years so far trying to get the car repaired or looked at.  They keep on telling me that they are not going to cover anything and that I need to pay for repairs.  I finally got the car towed to an independent service shop and they are telling me that the engine is indeed blown and that I need to replace it.  Costs are expected to be in the $3700 range.

I started my vehicle, and was  finishing up a phone call when I noticed smoke coming from my hood. When I opened the hood to investigate flames shot up from my engine. I called 911  and fortunately the fire  department was close and we're able to put out the fire quickly and no one was hurt. If it hadn't been for the phone conversation keeping my attention, I would have taken off normally and the outcome could of been seriously different. I'm not sure what happens when you are actively driving a car that engulfs in flames but I imagine it's not pretty.  There was a open recall on my car for a low pressure fuel tube malfunction that  was thought to cause fires. The Kia dealership denied I had an open recall asked me to remove car from facility or they would tow it . They were low on space. . They said that they wouldn't cover my car for any reason anyway because it doesn't have the original engine it came with.  The engine was  replaced by Kia because of engine defect and recall but the local dealership could not see this car history.  Eventually I was able to get a case opened with the corporate office and an inspection was done. They still denied me and no one was on the same page as far as car history. Was given the run around. The inspection report and estimate I have contradict one another. They spent 6 to tell me my cars problem is not there fault. They are unable and willing to answer my questions about inconsistencies.",

The dealer has ordered the part needed but they said that it might be weeks before they get the part in because it is on backorder and due to the safety risk, my car is undriveable. They will not release my vehicle to me without signing a waiver releasing them of liability.   Kia recalled 2013-2014 Optimas with the same Turbo engine last year, for this exact reason but the dealer said my vehicle was not included in the recall and this repair will be nearly $600 out of pocket even though this is a known issue.   I absolutely cannot and will not sign a waiver when I know my vehicle is dangerous to drive. I have systemic mastocytosis and that alone can cause anaphylaxis to be triggered by the gas odors.

First time, brake fluid was flushed and car appeared to operate normally afterwards. 3 months later, now, happened twice within two weeks. Apparently, a very common issue. The car shuts down and I am forced to coast/pullover/stop without any power from the engine and was fortunate this did not occur in an intersection. Others have noted the occurrence on the freeway. Like other, when I took the car in, no error codes were seen as the warning light had turned off so the mechanics do not know what the issue is. How does Kia not know what the issue is when the car could shut down, become inoperable suddenly? Once the warning light comes on, the brakes semi-lock and one is luck enough to get to safety, to pull over...

All the lights came on including the check engine light. I had to pull to the side and turn off my vehicle. Then it turned right back on and continued driving perfectly. Until the next day, I was driving on the highway and it was running perfect. Until I turned in a corner and my car stalled once again. This time the check engine light stayed on when I turned the vehicle back on. Then it started making this loud metal grinding noise. So I had to drive slow and the car almost shut down. I got it towed 70 miles back home. My car was running perfectly fine until that happened. It is a engine bearing knocking noise every time I start the car. It could be in the oil pan of the engine that is making that noise.  This put my safety at risk on the highway because I couldn't get more speed when my foot was on the petal and my car was slowing down slowly. There was lots of traffic so I had to avoid slowing down to quick before I got stuck in the lanes. So I had to put my blinkers on and pull to the side. The side was a little narrow because the cars were driving right beside mines and it was a busy highway. I thought I'd get hit but thankfully I didn't and pulled safely to the side.  I researched about this problem and it is pretty common with people that have the Kia Optima 2013. And its recalled for that problem. So my confirmation is from researching it on the internet. Yes the problem has been confirmed by Kia because they got law suited for it and that's why they had recalls. My vehicle will be inspected by the manufacturer on September 28th.   There was no warning signs or symbols of the car before that problem happened. It just happened instantly and it had me worried. The car was running perfectly fine getting to places. There was no problems prior to this. It first appeared on September 12th, 2021.",

My paint has been peeling off my Kia Optima for almost two years and sometimes the paint comes off in little pieces and other times it peels off in 6-12 inch sheets. Paint will come off during driving and while being washed. When driving the paint will fly to the back of my car and land of the ground, looks like snow is flying thru air.  I have had safety issues to date. First tIme was on my way to work and a large section of paint came up from the bottom of the windshield area and stuck to my windshield. Not only did it scare me, but it blocked my vision.windshield wipers would not move it. I had to quickly pull over to remove it.  Second time the same thing happened, but it landed on the windshield of the car behind me. I was unaware it happened until they pulled up next to me at the red light and got out of their vehicle to yell at me and removed the paint sheet. I understand this might not sound serious, but when something comes flying out of nowhere and lands on your windshield blocking your sight it is quite terrifying. I am not sure if this has happened to others with my same paint defect, but I know by researching my paint defect over the past two years, there are thousands of complaints on the internet about paint peeling off. When I contacted Kia in 2019 (corporate in Irvine, Ca), they informed me it was definitely a paint defect that originated during the painting process. Since there was not a recall isued, they were not going to pay for the car to be re-painted. At that time only the top of my car was affected, but now the majority of my car is losing paint. At this time I am wanting Kia to pay to have the car repainted, refund the cost of the vehicle or provide a credit to put towards a new car. At this point my vehicle is basically worthless because I can't sell it as is and trading it in results in me only getting approximately 30% of what the value is.",

EVERY warning light popped up onto the dash as I panicked to get off the highway unable to pick up speed and move out of the way of flying cars it slowed down to a complete stop I had just made it off the highway onto the side of the highway with cars flying by the grace of God my kids were not with me. I was not able to start the car up and had no idea as to why it happened I had no issues with my car and just brought it from Crown dealership not even a full 2 years of having the car. It was confirmed by a licensed mechanic that the engine is gone and no known reason as to why. The manufacture states it is beyond warranty as the car was purchased from crown they keep telling me to call and speak to Kia. Kia states it has no recall because of my VIN. I am not the first and not last to have this unexpectedly happen. I keep the up oil changes, tune ups, new tires and more done. now to know the engine is gone an it is not my fault no help and additional 5,000 for repair I am still making  payments on the car and can not even drive it. I could have died on the road or highway due to the car just stopping on it own while driving the warning lights didn't come on until after the car was done going. I had no choice but to get over quick still risking to get hit and unable to do or know anything. This is crazy how you can take car of the car and not be able to do anything other than pay more on the car that was not even close to the total being added on now.

I CALLED 911 AND REPORTED IT TO THE POLICE AND WAITED FOR THEM TO COME. THE CAR EXPLODED A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE THEY GOT TO ME AND THE FIRE QUICKLY ENGULFED THE CAR REACHING INTO THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE. THE STREET HAD TO BE COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF FROM ALL TRAFFIC.

MY CARS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I DON'T HAVE $800 TO FIX THE STARTER.

THEY SAID IT NEEDED A STARTER AND AN ELECTRICAL ASSESSMENT FOR A SHORT, AS STARTER BEGAN SMOKING WITH THE VEHICLE NOT EVEN RUNNING. NOW THEY ARE SAYING IT NEEDS A NEW JUNCTION BOX/FUSE BOX OVER $2900 AND MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO OTHER PROBLEMS BUT NOT COVERED AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY. I HAVE ALREADY PAID $900+ DOLLARS FOR FUEL PUMP, I EXCHANGED THE BATTERY WHERE I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT, AND $493 FOR STARTER. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THE JUNCTION BOX WOULD RANDOMLY FAIL OR SHORT AND NEED REPLACEMENT, UNLESS IT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL BLACK SMOKE ELECTRICAL SMELL THAT HAPPENED WHEN ENGINE SEIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE.",

I CALLED A FAMILY MECHANIC AND DESCRIBED IN MORE GREATER DETAIL ABOUT MY ISSUE FROM START TO FINISH, HE ADVISED ME NOT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE THAT IT WAS DISPLAYING THE EXACT QUALITIES AS THE LISTED RECALL AND I SHOULD CALL KIA MOTOR COMPANY TO HAVE THE LOOK INTO MY CLASS OF VEHICLES FURTHER. LONG STORY SHORT I WAS BASICALLY LEFT HOMELESS IN A CITY AND STATE PRETTY MUCH BEAT ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF EVERY GETTING MY CAR BACK AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT IT DROPPED BELOW 28 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

I MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH KIA TO NO AVAIL. SOME ONE WENT SO FAR AS TO STEAL A SAFE OUT OF MY VEHICLE.

ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AGO, I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND SWITCHED LANES TO PASS A CAR; AS I BEGAN ACCELERATING MY CAR FELT LIKE SOMEONE JUST PULLED THE PLUG ON IT. I LOST MOST OF MY ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND IT FELT LIKE NOT ENOUGH FUEL WAS GETTING SUPPLIED TO THE ENGINE. MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IMMEDIATELY. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT TO O'REILLY TO CHECK THE CODE ON MY CAR AND IT CAME BACK WITH P0087, WHICH IS RELATED TO LOW FUEL PRESSURE. LOOKING INTO IT FURTHER ON NHTSA.GOV, I FOUND COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THIS YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL THAT STATE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBLE ISSUE WITH THE LOW PRESSURE FUEL LINE AND HOW IT MAY DEVELOP CRACKS OR LEAKS DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT IN THE ENGINE. THIS CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF A FIRE STARTING IN THE ENGINE.    I ALSO FOUND THAT KIA WAS GOING TO BEGIN NOTIFYING AFFECTED CUSTOMERS BEGINNING ON APRIL 16TH, 2020. I HAVE WAITED THIS OUT TO SEE IF I WOULD GET A RECALL NOTICE, BUT BEING 11 DAYS LATER, I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE I AM EXPERIENCING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS ISSUE WITH THE FUEL LINE. MY CAR STARTS ROUGH, RUNS ROUGH, AND HAS VERY POOR ACCELERATION; ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER RPMS. IT FEELS AS IF MY CAR CHUGS AT TIMES.     I HAVE DEALT WITH RECALL ISSUES BEFORE WITH MY VEHICLE (A COMPLETE ENGINE BLOCK REPLACEMENT DUE TO EXCESS METAL SHAVINGS LEFT IN THE ENGINE DURING MANUFACTURING) AND MY CAR DIED ON THE FREEWAY. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE TO EVEN GET THE DEALER TO ADMIT THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE AND REQUIRED MY CAR DYING A SECOND TIME ON THE FREEWAY AND A TOW THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR TO GET THEM TO DO ANYTHING. IN SHORT, I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT MESS AGAIN TO FIX, WHAT SO FAR APPEARS TO BE (OR WILL BE), A RECALL THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED ABOUT. THANK YOU.",

THEY GAVE ME NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR THAT WOULD CAUSE IT TO CATCH ON FIRE.    WE FILED A CLAIM WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY, WHO CONFIRMED THE CAR WAS TOTALED AND LISTED A RECENT, BUT AS YET UNANNOUNCED, RECALL ON MY EXACT YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL OF THE CAR.

THE ENGINE STALLED AS I WAS TRAVELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND I HAD TO TRY TO PULL IT SAFELY TO THE EDGE OF THE ROAD. I WAS ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE TO A BUSINESS, SO I TRIED TO START THE CAR TO GET IT SAFELY OFF THE ROADWAY. IT TRIED TO START, BUT MADE AN EXTREMELY LOUD \"KA-THUNK\" SOUND AND THEN STARTED SMOKING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I TURNED OFF THE FLASHERS, CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK AND A RIDE HOME. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC NEAR MY HOME AND CALLED FOR A RIDE FOR MYSELF. ONCE I ARRIVED HOME, I CALLED KIA CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. THEY PROVIDED A CASE NUMBER AND STATED THAT I WOULD NOW NEED MY CAR TO BE TOWED TO A KIA DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS. THE KIA DEALER DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A LOANER VEHICLES, SO I AM WAITING UNTIL MONDAY TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED IN HOPES I CAN ACQUIRE A VEHICLE AT THAT TIME UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF KIA IS GOING TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.

I HAVE NOTICED MY MOTOR KNOCKING LOUDER & UPON VISUAL EXAM, THE ENTIRE MOTOR IS SHAKING WHICH CAN BE FELT WHILE DRIVING BUT MOST NOTICEABLE CAUSING CAR TO SHAKE WHEN AT AN IDOL. MOST RECENT, I'VE BEGAN TO SMELL A VERY STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE UPON STARTING THE CAR BUT WORSENS UPON ACCELERATING. THE CAR IS RUNNING RICH, AND SMELL OF GASOLINE IS SO STRONG, WE HAVE TO ROLL DOWN WINDOWS. THE FUMES ARE MORE PROMINENT TOWARDS REAR OF CAR CLOSE TO EXHAUST. I CANNOT SEE ANY LEAKAGE OF FUEL WHEN LOOKING HOWEVER I AM LOSING FUEL SOMEWHERE BECAUSE MY GAS MILEAGE HAS GREATLY GOTTEN WORSE & BURNING THROUGH IT AT A FAST PACE.

MECHANIC STATES THE ENGINE TEST DID PASS BUT FEELS IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AT SOME POINT?? MECHANIC SAID HE DIDN'T SMELL ANY GASOLINE BUT HE DID NOT TEST DRIVE THE CAR OR RUN DIAGNOSTIC TEST AS HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE $129 FEE......I DECLINED PAYING THE FEE AND REQUESTED IT BE DONE AS THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM BUT THAT WAS DENIED. I NEED THIS ADDRESSED AND REPAIRED. IT IS DANGEROUS, COSTING ME MORE MONEY FOR GAS & AFFECTING MY JOB.

(OIL PASSAGES MAY BE BLOCK DUE TO DEBRIS FROM MANUFACTURER CLEANING DEFECT. CAUSING PREMATURE ROD BEARING WEAR FROM NOT CLEANING ENGINE PROPERLY BEFORE ENGINE ASSEMBLY)..

I PULLED OFF AT THE NEAREST SERVICE STATION AND CHECKED THE OIL AND FOUND NO OIL ON THE DIPSTICK OTHER THAN SOME BURNT OIL RESIDUE. THE STRONG BURNING SMELL AND SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE OPENING. I IMMEDIATELY ADDED OIL AND HAVE BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON IT EVER SINCE. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND HAVE LEARNED OF THE MANY PROBLEMS THAT KIA OWNERS ARE HAVING WITH THESE PARTICULAR ENGINES. THE DEALERSHIP CONDUCTED A OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AND DETERMINED THE CAR IS LOSING A LITTLE OVER A QUART OF OIL EVERY 1000 MILES OR SO, BUT ISN'T LEAKING ANYWHERE. I HAVE READ MANY OF THE STORIES OF ENGINE FAILURES AND FIRES CAUSED BY THIS AND I DO NOT WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS WHILE ON THE ROAD WITH MY FAMILY. THIS CAR ONLY HAD ABOUT 107,000 MILES ON IT WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THIS OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND SHOULD NOT BE GOING THROUGH OIL LIKE THIS WITH SO LITTLE MILES ON IT. THE DEALERSHIP IS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT COVERS THIS AND NO RECALLS HAVE BEEN ISSUED DESPITE ALL OF THE TROUBLE KIA OWNERS ARE HAVING.

ON SATURDAY I WAS TOLD I WOULD GET A CALL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, WHICH I NEVER DID. I FINALLY HAD TO CALL THURSDAY, JUST TO BE ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES TELLING ME ITS ONLY THE TURBO AFFECTED, NOT THE ENGINE OR TURBO LINE, AND THEREFORE IT'S NOT UNDER RECALL. NOT ONLY DID THEY TELL ME SOMETHING I ALREADY KNEW, THAT THE TURBO WAS BLOWN, BUT I'M CHARGED $110 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC FEE THAT I WAS NEVER TOLD ABOUT BEFOREHAND, TO CHECK SOMETHING THAT'S ON RECALL, NOT TO MENTION THE TOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR. I CALLED KIAS CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO JUST GAVE ME AN OH WELL THAT'S TOO BAD SORRY NO ONE TOLD YOU, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO HELP. I'M NOT EVEN CONVINCED THAT THEY DID ANY TESTS ON MY ENGINE, OR LOOKED INTO THE CAUSE OF THE TURBO FAILURE. MY ONLY EXPLANATION WHEN ASKING ABOUT THE CAR WAS, 'IT NEEDS A TURBO'. WHILE READING OTHER PEOPLE'S STORIES ABOUT THE RECALL, EVERYONE ELSE'S DEALER SAW THAT THE CAR COULDN'T DRIVE, REPLACED THE ENGINE AND TURBO, AND CALLED IT A DAY.

I STARTED TO NOTICE SOME SLUGGISH IN MY ENGINE PERFORMANCE AND THEN AFTER HEARING A LOW KNOCKING SOUND FROM THE ENGINE. I DECIDED TO CHECK THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL TO SEE IF I WAS LOW DUE TO A PAST EXPERIENCE WITH A CAR HAVING A BAD VALVE COVER GASKET.  SO, WHEN I CHECKED MY OIL LEVEL ON THE DIPSTICK IT WAS BETWEEN THE LOW AND FULL LINE. THINKING THAT THIS WAS JUST MAYBE DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DEALER HAD NOT PUT ENOUGH OIL IN DURING THE OIL CHANGE. I JUST BOUGHT TWO QUARTS OF 5W20 ENGINE OIL TO BRING THE OIL BACK TO THE FULL LINE ON THE DIPSTICK AND NOT VISUALLY SEEING ANY SIGNS OF OIL LEAKING ANYWHERE. HOWEVER, JUST ONE WEEK FROM WHEN I ADDED THE TWO QUARTS OF OIL. I STARTED TO HEAR THE KNOCKING SOUND AGAIN AND TO FIND OUT THAT I AM DOWN 1 QUART OF OIL. I DECIDED THEN TO PARK MY CAR UNDER A PIECE OF CARDBOARD FOR A DAY AND DO A THOROUGH LOOK FOR ANY SIGNS OF OIL LEAKING IN THE ENGINE BUT, I DID NOT COME ACROSS ANY OIL LEAKING ANYWHERE. I DECIDED THEN TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF OTHER KIA OWNERS WERE HAVING THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHER KIA OWNERS WITH THIS GDI MOTOR ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE WITH SOME OWNERS HAVE THE MOTOR SEIZE DUE TO THE ENGINE OIL BEING LOST IN THE ENGINE BY DEFECTIVE CONNECTING RODS THAT FAIL IN THE ENGINE. I HAVE EVEN FOUND OUT THAT HYUNDAI HAS A RECALL ON THIS SAME ENGINE THAT IS BEING USED IN MY 2013 KIA OPTIMA. MY CONCERN NOW IS THAT IF KIA ENDS UP ACKNOWLEDGING THIS EVENTUALLY AS A RECALL THAT THE WARRANTY WILL BE MORE THAN 10 YEARS OR 120, 000 MILES AS WITH MY HIGHWAY TRAVEL COMMUTE DAILY TO WORK I AM OVER THIS MILEAGE.

THIS MAKES THE CAR NOT MOVE AND GET INTO DANGEROUS SITUATIONS WHEN ENTERING AN INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE CARS APPROACHING MIGHT HIT THE CAR. THE SITUATION CAN BE REPEATED ONCE THE SYSTEM RELEASES THE POWER, LOSING TRACTION AGAIN, EXTENDING ADDITIONALLY 1 TO 2 SECONDS TO THIS SITUATION. LOOSING TRACTION IS EVEN EASIER WHEN THE WHEELS ARE TURNED.  I OPENED A TICKET ON KIA CUSTOMER AFFAIRS (K3229681) ONCE THE DEALER DID NOT EVEN TESTED THE CAR WITH ME, AND I GOT THE TYPICAL ANSWER IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A RECALL ON THIS SUBJECT (IT IS THE WAY IT WORKS)  AFTER MANY CALLS AND VISITS, I WAS ABLE TO GET FROM THE MANUFACTURE'S KIA CUSTOMER AFFAIRS VERBALLY CONFIRM IT IS THE WAY SHOULD WORK, IMMOBILIZING THE CAR FOR 1 TO 2 SECONDS. THE ONLY SOLUTION PROVIDED IS TO DISABLE THE TCS WHICH BASED ON THE MANUAL DISABLES ALSO THE ESP.  THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BY OTHER OWNERS ON MULTIPLE FORUMS, AND NO OTHER CAR I DROVE WORKS IN THAT WAY, NOT EVEN MY HYUNDAI SONATA 2013 WHICH IS THE SAME CAR BUT WITH DIFFERENT BODY.

I HAD BEEN DRIVING MY OTHER CAR FOR 29YRS, AND I ASSUMED THAT NEWER CARS MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERNT, SUCH AS BEING MORE SENSITIVE WITH STEERING. I HAVE ALMOST HAD A COLLISION ON THE FREEWAY BECAUSE THERE ARE ALSO BLIND SPOTS IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE KIA OTIMA. THIS TIME I DID END UP IN COLLISION BECAUSE OF BLINDSPOTS AND OVERSTEERING IN ORDER TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR NEXT TO ME, AND INSTEAD HIT THE CAR NEXT TO ME ON THE OTHER LANE WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR WAY THIS OCCURRED FROM SENSETIVE OVERSTEERING. OUR AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. BEFORE THIS ACCIDENT, I HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM KIA STATING THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF I WOULD LIKE TO TRADE UP TO THE KNEW KIA OPTIMA. THE EMAIL STATED THEY HAD NEW FEATURES; SUCH AS CAMERAS FOR BLIND SPOTS. THIS MADE ME AWARE THAT KIA KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THESE SERIOUS .BLINDSPOTS. THE CAR WAS ALSO BEGINNING TO RUMBLE, AND I BELIEVED IT WAS COMING FROM THE ENGINE,IN FACT QUITE SURE IT WAS FROM THE ENGINE. I ALSO HAD RECEIVED A LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM KIA, STATING THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINES FROM CERTAIN YEARS OF THE KIA OPTIMA MY CAR WAS WITHIN THE YEARS STATED. IT STATED THEY WOULD HONOR THIS PROBLEM IF YOU KEPT THIS LETTER IN YOUR CAR, WHEN BRINGING IT IN FOR REPAIRS. I WAS GOING TO DO THIS, BUT THE CAR IS NOW TOTALED AFTER THE ACCIDENT.",

THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED THIS IT WAS A WINDY DAY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS JUST DUE TO THE HIGH WINDS... BUT, I'VE NOTICED THIS SAME ISSUE EVERY TIME I DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY, EVEN WHEN THERE IS LITTLE TO NO WIND. THE CAR REFUSES TO STAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE, CONSTANTLY VEERING LEFT AND RIGHT (EVEN ON A FLAT SURFACE). THE STEERING WHEEL BARELY MOVES, BUT THE CAR ITSELF WILL WONDER BACK AND FORTH, REQUIRING CONSTANT CORRECTION BY THE DRIVER. THE DEALERSHIP HAS REPEATEDLY SAID ITS THE SLOPE IN THE ROAD, EVEN THOUGH I'VE TOLD THEM I'VE EXPERIENCED IT ON MULTIPLE HIGHWAYS. NOW I AM NOTICING THE SAME PROBLEM AT REGULAR SPEEDS OF 35MPH AND MORE. THE STEERING WONDERS AND MY SUSPENSION SEEMS NONEXISTENT. SIMPLE TAR LINES IN THE PAVEMENT FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING OVER POTHOLES. DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY DO FEEL A BIT OF A ROUGH RIDE, BUT SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THESE ISSUES COMBINED MAKE DRIVING UNSAFE AND AT TIMES, SCARY.

MAXIMUM SPEEDS REACHED WERE NO MORE THAN 50 MPH WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE DRIVE BEING AT 35 MPH.  ABOUT HALFWAY HOME SHE NOTICED AN UNFAMILIAR SMELL BUT WAS NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS, AND THE CAR SEEMED TO BE DRIVING NORMALLY AND NO WARNING LIGHTS EVER CAME ON.  AS SHE PULLED INTO THE GARAGE AT OUR HOME SHE THEN NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  SHE IMMEDIATELY OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW FLAMES SHOOTING OUT FROM THE BACK OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT NEAR THE TURBO.  SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND GRABBED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. SHE USED THE ENTIRE EXTINGUISHER TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES.  I CAME HOME AND TOGETHER WE PUSHED THE VEHICLE OUT OF THE GARAGE AND CALLED KIA.  THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED 43 MILES AWAY TO THE CLOSEST KIA DEALERSHIP.  KIA COOPERATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS DIVISION WAS IMMEDIATELY IN CONTACT WITH US, WE STATED THAT WE NO LONGER FELT SAFE WITH THIS VEHICLE AND WANTED IT REPLACED.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED US THAT THEY COULD NOT EVEN TOUCH THE VEHICLE UNTIL AN INVESTIGATOR FROM KIA CORP. LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE.  AFTER PICTURES OF THE INCIDENT WERE RECEIVED BY COOPERATE THE WHOLE SITUATION CHANGED.  I FEEL THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NOT BURNED BADLY (ONLY BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S QUICK ACTION) KIA IS NOT TREATING  THIS AS SERIOUS AS THEY SHOULD ANYMORE.  I WAS INFORMED BY KIA CORPORATE THAT THEY WOULD BE FIXING THE VEHICLE UNDER WARRANTY AND RETURNING IT TO US.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN ONCE FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND WHEN IT RETURNED THE TURBO CHARGER WAS \"GLOWING RED HOT LIKE LAVA\"  THEY ALSO SAID THAT CORP. ENGINEERS FROM KIA WERE PERFORMING TESTS REMOTELY AND THAT NO ATTEMPTS HAD EVEN BEEN MADE TO TRY AND FIX THE PROBLEM YET.      ....UPDATED 06/09/15*BF",

I GOT NONE OF THE ADVERTISED PERKS, LOYALTY BONUS OR ANY OTHER ADVERTISED BONUS THAT I HAD READ ABOUT, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY WARNING. TRADING FOR THIS OPTIMA WAS THE WORST MISTAKE I COULD HAVE MADE. I HAD ONE SERVICE CALL WORKED ON THROUGH MY WARRANTY ON THE AMANTI.

I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TO KIA, AND KIA DOES NOTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY SAY IT'S WITHIN SPECS.  THERE WILL BE MANY HEAD ON CRASHES WHERE CARS CROSS THE CENTER LANE BECAUSE OF THIS STEERING, AND IM SURE MANY FATALITIES WILL RESULT.  I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS WILL HAPPEN IF IT ALREADY HASN'T.

        "summary": "ABOUT A DAY AFTER I BOUGHT MY BRAND NEW 2013 KIA, I NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE VEERED TO THE LEFT. I TOOK IT BACK THAT WEEKEND TO GET AN ALIGNMENT AND THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T AN ALIGNMENT, BUT THAT THE STEERING COLUMN WAS OFF. SO, THEY ADJUSTED THAT. WHEN I TOOK DELIVERY OF THE VEHICLE AGAIN, THE ISSUE WAS STILL THERE. I TOOK THE CAR TO THEM AGAIN, AND THIS TIME, THEY SAID THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TWISTED. I THEN MOVED FROM VA TO FL TWO DAYS LATER. AT THIS POINT I ONLY HAD ABOUT 1200 MILES ON MY CAR. DURING THE TRIP, I NOTICED THE STEERING DOING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. I CALLED THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM TO JUST TELL ME WHAT THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE CAR. I WAS TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS MADE WITH A BATCH OF OTHER VEHICLES THAT HAD THIS ISSUE AND THERE IS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN INVOLVED WITH IT. SHE SAID ITS PROTOCOL TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN MULTIPLE TIMES SO THAT THEY CAN RULE OUT CERTAIN ISSUES. SHE STATED THE NEXT STEP WAS TO REDO THE SUSPENSION. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I HAD TO GO TO A DIFFERENT DEALER FOR THIS BECAUSE I WAS NOW IN FL. ALSO, UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, THE FIRST DEALER DIDN'T RECORD WHEN I WENT IN THE FIRST TWO TIMES. SO WHEN I GO TO THIS NEW DEALER AT 2500 MILES, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, GIVE ME AN ALIGNMENT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE AND SEND ME ON MY WAY. THIS IS TRULY RIDICULOUS. I BOUGHT A NEW CAR TO AVOID THESE ISSUES. AND KIA NEEDS TO OWN UP AND FIX THESE STEERING WHEEL ISSUES PROPERLY. I'M GOING BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN TOMORROW. PLEASE RECALL THIS STEERING WHEEL ISSUE.  *TR",
