I ROLLED WINDOWS DOWN PULLED OVER WITHIN A BLOCK TO A NAPA STORE. THE EMPLOYEE TOLD ME THEY DO NOT RUN DIAGNOSTICS AND I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE. I DROVE SLOWLY TO A 2ND AUTO PARTS STORE 1 MILE AWAY TO RUN DIAGNOSTICS. ONCE DONE, DIAGNOSTICS IDENTIFIED A MISS-FIRE ON SPARK PLUG #2. HAD VEHICLE TOWED TO HOME AND TOOK 'HELI-COIL' OFF AND SPARK PLUG CAME OUT WITH IT DAMAGED. THE HELI COIL WAS ALSO DAMAGED. THE THREADS OF SPARK PLUG WAS FLATTENED THREE THREADS FROM BOTTOM.  CONTACTED AUTO PARTS STORE AGAIN WHERE THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT FORD HAS BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THERE TRITON SPARK PLUGS BLOWING OUT ON THE 5.4L ENGINES THAT THEY ONLY SCREW IN 3 THREADS INTO THE HEAD OF THE ENGINE AND THERE WERE PENDING LAWSUITS.  THE NEXT DAY I CALLED FORD DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH THE ACTING SERVICE MANAGER. \"HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT AND I SHOULD CALL CUSTOMER CARE OF FORD: 800-392-3673.  I DID AND REP. TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL AND MY VEHICLE AND IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AT 101,100.MI. THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  IN THE EVENT THERE WERE TO BE A RE-CALL TO SAVE MY RECEIPTS AND FORD WOULD REIMBURSE ME. I READ ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS WERE OR HAD HAD REGARDING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A FEW VEHICLES LEAKING GAS WITH THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS ALL HAPPENING WHEN THE CARS, TRUCKS AND SUVS EXCEEDS 100,000MILES.  I FEEL THIS IS NOT ONLY POOR MANUFACTURING OF AN INFERIOR ALUMINUM CASING AND SPARK PLUG AND ALSO NOT ENOUGH THREADS TO HOLD THE SPARK PLUG IN SAFELY.  TO HAVE IT JUMP OUT ALLOWS GAS TO ALSO BE EXPELLED ONTO THE CARS REMAINING PARTS AND VAPORS COULD IGNITE CAUSING THE CAR TO POTENTIALLY CATCH FIRE.",

WHEN IT WAS SAFE TO DO, AFTER TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO GET THE HEADLIGHTS WORKING BY TURNING THE SWITCH DIAL, I IMMEDIATELY FOUND A SOMEWHAT SAFE SPOT TO PULL OVER. I GOT OUT, LOOKED IN THE FRONT AND SURELY THEY WERE NOT WORKING BUT ONLY IN FLASH MODE. I TURNED CAR OFF, CHECKED FUSES, WAITED ABOUT 10 MORE MINUTES, THEN STARTED CAR AGAIN. THEY FINALLY CAME ON, SO I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION AND MADE A DASH TOWARDS HOME AGAIN, WHICH WAS PROBABLY ANOTHER 35 MILES OR SO.

THEY INSPECTED THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM AND THE INTERMEDIATE (LOWER) SHAFT WAS BINDING AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE FORD RECALL FOR 2005-2011 FORD VEHICLES, I CAN NOT GET PARTS.  I CALLED FORD  AND WENT TO THE DRUM HILL DEALERSHIP IN LOWELL BUT SINCE THE 2004 MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS ARE NOT IN THE RECALL, I HAVE NO RECOURSE.  THIS IS THE SAME PART THAT NHTSA INVESTIGATED AND CALLED FOR A RECALL ON THE 2005-2011 FORD VEHICLES.  I BELIEVE THE 2004 VEHICLES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AS IT IS THE SAME PART IN THE POWER STEERING SHAFT THAT HAS FAILED IN THE 2004 THAT FAILS IN THE 2005-2011 MODELS.",

I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, JERRY'S FORD IN ANNANDALE, VIRGINIA.  EVEN THOUGH I KEPT THE CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR SEVERAL DAYS, THEY WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS WERE PROPERLY FUNCTIONING.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON I-95, HEADED TO NEW YORK, ON OCTOBER 6.  AT THAT TIME I LOST THE HEADLIGHTS AND THEY REMAINED OUT FOR WELL OVER ONE HOUR, REQUIRING ME TO KEEP THE HIGH BEAMS ACTIVATED WITH MY LEFT HAND WHILE DRIVING THE CAR.

OUR MARQUIS ENTERED THE PARKING LOT OF CONVENIENCE STORE SO THAT WE COULD INSTALL AIR IN LEFT FRONT TIRE. WE DID A U-TURN IN PARKING LOT TO PROCEED TO AIR COMPRESSOR.  WITH HER RIGHT FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL, MY WIFE STEERED THE CAR THROUGH THE U-TURN, HEADING TOWARD AIR COMPRESSOR.  SUDDENLY, WITHOUT ANY WARNING, THE CAR ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY.  THE BRAKE WOULD NOT WORK - BRAKE PEDAL WAS PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN; CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE AND TRAVELED OVER A LARGE CONCRETE BARRIER AND CRASHED INTO BUILDING.  THE CAR COULD NOT BE STEERED WHILE CAR SPED FORWARD.  THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. WE WERE WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS AND SHOULDER HARNESSES.  THANKFULLY, THE AUTO HIT THE BUILDING INSTEAD OF THE GASOLINE PUMPS IN PARKING LOT.  AFTER CRASHING INTO BUILDING, THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE OR \"REV\" AT HIGH RATE. A LADY WHO WAS PUMPING GAS INTO HER CAR RUSHED OVER TO ASSIST US. SHE INSISTED THAT MY WIFE KEEP HER FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL AND ASSISTED IN GETTING THE DRIVER'S DOOR OPEN AND INSTRUCTING FOR MY WIFE TO AVERT HER FACE AND INCH OVER IN SEAT TOWARD DOOR AFTER RELEASING THE SHOULDER HARNESS/SEAT BELT.
