I pull over & discover lower ball joint has separated causing the lower control arm to slip out of socket into the wheel & than separate from wheel. I mean its still attached to the vehicle but vehicle is completely disabled. It caused significant damage to the right front wheel and somewhat minor damage to the right front fender. Theres literally metal shaving all over the road from it carving the metal out of my wheel. Get home and my boyfriend tells me that he's discovered 3 safety recalls. So we call FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) they said they would have it towed to the dealership no problem but they needed a $103 for the tow that they would reimburse later. They told us to pick any dealership. So FCA has it towed from my driveway on 7/13 at 8:45pm to Lithia Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Portland Dealership.  Safety recall F23 was replaced by the dealership but the manufacturer (FCA) has not fixed the damage and is denying responsibility. FCA calls on 9/16 to finally tell us that a certified inspector has determined the damage to the wheel and fender is not from the recall. Which is a lie and I can take it to a mechanic and have that verified. They also go on to state they are not going to reimburse the $103 for the tow. So we go to the dealership to pick up the car the next day. I speak with Will in the service department and ask to see a copy of the inspection that the FCA is talking about. Will tells me that FCA never sent an inspector out and there is no inspection report stating that the damage is not from the recall. I have lots of photos of everything. Please contact me",

IT HAS BEEN KEPT SERVICED AND UP TO DATE ON ANY RECALL WORK SINCE. DURING THE DAY ON CHRISTMAS EVE 2019 I WAS RETURNING HOME FROM A VISIT AT MY MOTHER'S HOME AND SUDDENLY LOST CONTROL OF THE JEEP. THERE WAS LOUD NOISE AND THINGS BREAKING OFF THE VEHICLE AS I FOUGHT TO CONTROL IT AND PULL OVER. UPON INSPECTION, SAW THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WHEEL HAD COME LOOSE FROM THE SUSPENSION, TORE OFF THE FENDER WHEEL WELL AND BROKE A PIECE OFF THE RIGHT-SIDE RUNNING BOARD. UNDRIVEABLE, I HAD IT TOWED TO MY MECHANIC. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE CLOSED UNTIL AFTER NEW YEARS. IN EARLY JANUARY I FOUND OUT THE DIAGNOSIS WAS A SHEARED LOWER BALL JOINT FAILURE. I LOOKED IN MY FILES AND FOUND THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RECALLS THAT HAD BEEN PREFORMED TO THE VEHICLE. SAFETY RECALL F23- LOWER BALL JOINTS WAS DONE ON 8/1/2006. OBVIOUSLY, YOU ASSUME THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED AND THE VEHICLE IS SAFE AFTER THE WORK IS DONE. I LUCKILY WAS TRAVELING AT 30MPH, AND NOT AT HIGHWAY SPEED, SO I HAVE ONLY ENCOUNTERED A FINANCIAL BURDEN. (ABOUT $4K FOR RENTAL, REPAIR & BODYWORK) I AM SURE IF I WAS GOING FASTER OR IN TRAFFIC, I WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED. HOW DO THE THOUSANDS OF JEEP LIBERTY OWNERS STILL ON THE ROAD WHO ARE UP TO DATE ON RECALLS CONFIDENTLY DRIVE THEIR VEHICLES IF THE RECALL WORK FAILS IN THE EXACT MANNER DESCRIBED AS THE PROBLEM MEANT TO BE FIXED BY THE RECALL? I'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR CLOSE TO 40 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY VEHICLE SUFFER A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE RESULTING IN A CRASH BEFORE THIS.",

ON JUNE 3, 2016 I WAS STRUCK BY ANOTHER MOTORIST ON MY HOME FROM WORK. I COMMUTE EVERY DAY FROM THE SOUTHWEST SUBURBS OF CHICAGO TO DOWNTOWN CHICAGO. I HAVE TAKEN THE UTMOST PRIDE IN MY JEEP, PROVIDING REGULAR MAINTENANCE. IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS I HAVE SPENT OVER $1500 IN REPLACEMENTS.  I RECENTLY PURCHASED 4 BRAND NEW TIRES, A NEW ALTERNATOR, A NEW MUFFLER, OIL PRESSURE SWITCH AND AN EVAP SENSOR.  I HAVE ALSO MADE PURCHASES TO CUSTOMIZE MY JEEP, BY ADDING NEON LIGHTS IN THE INSIDE, SEAT COVERS, AND A NEW STEREO SYSTEM.  ASIDES FROM ALL THE LOVE AND ATTENTION I PUT INTO MY JEEP, THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MY ACCIDENT THAT SCARED ME THE MOST.  AFTER THE OTHER VEHICLE STRUCK ME, MY JEEP KEPT ON ROLLING, HOPPING A CURB, NARROWLY MISSING A TREE AND HOPPING ANOTHER CURB AND TOTALING MY JEEP. I SUFFERED A LEFT KNEE CONTUSION IN THE END.  THE REAL HORROR IS THAT MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. FOR MY VEHICLE TO MAKE 2 LARGE IMPACTS AND NO AIR BAGS HAS LEFT ME WITH A COMPLETE DISTRUST IN THE BRAND. IF MY LIFE WAS AT A HIGHER RISK OR IF I HAD STRUCK THAT TREE OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE ON THE ROAD, IT'S SAD TO THINK THAT THE ONE SAFETY FEATURE THAT COULD HAVE SAVED MY LIFE, TOOK NO ACTION.  YES, A PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUIT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THIS, BUT I WANT TO ENSURE 100% THAT THEY?RE MAY BE THOUSANDS OUT THERE THAT PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEIR JEEP, NOT KNOWING THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE A FATAL MISTAKE.

I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT TO BRING IN MY CAR TO TEMPE CHRYSLER JEEP ON MARCH 5, 2015 TO HAVE THE OEM TRAILER HITCH INSTALLED.  AFTER AN HOUR WAIT THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO INSTALL IT BECAUSE THE 'WELL NUTS RUSTED OFF' AND THAT REPAIRS (AT CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE) ARE NEEDED BEFORE INSTALLATION CAN BE PERFORMED.  THE DEALERSHIP GAVE ME A SERVICE PROCEDURE FORM TO SIGN INDICATING THAT INSPECTION REVEALED DAMAGE OR DETERIORATION NEAR THE HITCH ATTACHMENT POINTS ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE PROPER INSTALLATION AND UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE SAFETY RECALL REPAIR. I BOUGHT THIS PRE-OWNED VEHICLE FROM EARNHARDT CHRYSLER IN CHANDLER, ARIZONA  ON AUGUST 2011 AND WAS UNAWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND ALSO THE DETERIORATION AND RUST ON THE UNDER BODY OF MY VEHICLE.

I DROPPED THE CAR OFF THINKING I WOULD HAVE IT BACK WITHIN 2 DAYS MAXIMUM, AFTER ALMOST 1 WEEK I CALLED AND REQUESTED A RENTAL OR LOANER VEHICLE AND WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS THAT THEY DO NOT OFFER SUCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THEY WILL GET THE PARTS TO FIX MY VEHICLE SO THEY HAVE MY CAR AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DRIVE. I THEN CONTACTED CHRYSLER LLC MYSELF AND REQUESTED THEY PROVIDE A RENTAL SINCE MINE WAS IN FOR SAFETY RECALLS. THEY AT FIRST REFUSED STATING THAT IT IS BECAUSE I AM THE 3RD OWNER OF THE VEHICLE, ONCE I ARGUE THE FACT THAT IT SHOULDN'T MATTER SINCE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE NOT SOMETHING I DID, THEY SHOULD STILL BE RESPONSIBLE THEY FINALLY DECIDE TO SUPPLY A RENTAL BY END OF THE DAY (9/25/13). I WENT UP TO ENTERPRISE TO WAIT FOR A CAR AND WHILE I WAS THERE WAITING I GET INFORMED THAT CHRYSLER HAS CHANGED THEIR MIND AND THIS TIME DUE TO THE VEHICLE NOT BEING UNDER WARRANTY, AGAIN SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T MATTER AS IT IS A SAFETY RECALL. SO AT THIS POINT I AM A SINGLE MOM WITH 4 CHILDREN AND I HAVE NO VEHICLE TO CARE FOR THEM AND NO TIME FRAME AS TO WHEN I WILL HAVE MINE BACK. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THIS?

I HAVE HAD THE AIRBAG LIGHT COME ON AND GO OFF. AND I COMES ON WHENEVER IT WANTS TO. AND IT SCARES ME BECAUSE IF THE AIRBAGS GO OFF, NOT ONLY WILL I BE MAD, BUT YOU CAN BET, ILL PROB RAISE HELL. BECAUSE I DON'T FELL SAVE DRIVING A CAR THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE THE AIRBAGS GO OFF. ALSO I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE POWER LOCK ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WORKS WHEN I WANTS TO. LIKE I HAVE TO HIT IT A COUPLE TIMES TO GET IT TO WORK. NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL. ALSO THE CD PLAYER DOESN'T WORK. LIKE I'VE CHANGE ALL THE FUSES TO TRY AND GET THE DOOR LOCK/CDPLAYER TO WORK. AND NOTHING CHANGED. IT MAKE A REALLY LOUD AND ANNOYING NOISE AFTER THE CD PLAYS FOR AWHILE. THAT I DON'T CAR ABOUT. ALSO ONE DAY I GOT IN MY JEEP. I DON'T KNOW HOW BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED, BUT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE, ON THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR. WAS NOTHING BUT ICE. THE DOOR STILL OPENED AND CLOSED, NO PROBLEM BUT, IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY TOOK A GALLON OF WATER AND DUMPED IN DOWN THE INSIDE OF MY DOOR AND IT FROZE OVER. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEMS I'VE NOTICED WITH IT. THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS THE WHOLE AIR BAG THING. I HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE THAT IT WILL BE FIXED, BUT WILL IT BE FIXED FOR GOOD. BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING AROUND AND DOING MY DAILY THINGS, KNOWING THAT I, OR MY FAMILY, OR FRIENDS COULD GET HURT FROM THE AIRBAGS GOING OFF. SO I HOPE THAT WHATEVER THE COMPANY IS DOING TO FIX IT WORKS, BECAUSE EVERYDAY I GET IN MY JEEP, THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT IS GOING THREW MY HEAD. THANKS  *TR",

I CAN'T RECALL IF ANY CERTAIN SPEEDS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE BUT IT SEEMED LIKE IF I WAS TO HIT A BUMPY PART IN THE ROAD OR SIMILAR THEN I WOULD EITHER SEE THE LIGHT COME ON OR IF IT WAS ALREADY ON, IT WOULD GO OFF.  NOW IT NEVER TURNS OFF.  I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I KNOW THE RUN AROUND ILL BE GIVEN JUST AS EVERYONE ELSE I'VE READ ABOUT.  I HAVE RESEARCHED HOW AIRBAG SYSTEMS OPERATE AND HAVE SLOWLY BEGAN MY OWN PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHAT IS THE CAUSE.  ONLY PROBLEM, EVERY THING I READ STATES THAT I SHOULD NOT PLAY AROUND WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM AND OFFERS NO INFO RELATED TO TESTING PROCEDURES.  I WORK ON CARS AND ELECTRONICS OFTEN, SO IF I JUST HAD THE CORRECT INFORMATION TO FEEL SAFE, THEN I WOULD SURELY TRY FINDING THE PROBLEM MYSELF.  WITH THIS SAID, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WONDER ALL THE TIME, WHEN IS MY AIRBAG GOING TO EXPLODE IN MY FACE.

UPON TAKING IT TO THE JEEP DEALER, THEY STATED THE WINDOW REGULATOR NEEEDED TO BE REPLACED. AFTER PAYING $227.94, MY WINDOW WAS FIXED AND BACK TO NORMAL. SURPRISINGLY, A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE RIGHT WINDOW FELL WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY (THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE). BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP WE WENT, FOR A SECOND AND UNNECESSARY DIAGNOSTIC (THE MAINTENCE MAN SAID THIS WAS A PROBLEM HE HAD FREQUENTLY SEEN) TO DETERMINE THE REGULATOR WAS BROKEN. I PAID TO HAVE THE SECOND WINDOW FIXED AND CONTINUED TO DRIVE MY CAR. THIS WEEK, THE LEFT REAR WINDOW FELL AGAIN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD (20 MPH). I CONTACTED JEEP HEADQUARTERS DIRECTLY AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE (INCULDING THE NHTSA WEBSITE) THAT THIS IS CLEARLY NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND THEY HAVE NEGLECTED TO ADDRESS THE SAFTEY ISSUE WITH THEIR AUTOMOBILE OWNERS. THEY ARE REQUESTING THAT I TAKE MY JEEP BACK IN FOR ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC, AND TO CONFIRM THERE HAS BEEN NO \"NEGLECT\" OF MAINTENANCE ON MY PART. MY JEEP HAS JUST OVER 65,000 MILES ' IT IS IN PERFECT CONDITION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FAULTY WINDOWS. UPON INSPECTION OF THE DEALER THIS WEEK, JEEP SAYS THEY WILL DETERMINE THE NEXT STEP DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS. THIS ISSUE IS DANGEROUS FOR MULTIPLE REASONS - CHILDREN RIDING IN THE CAR, THE FRIGHTENING NOISE MADE FROM THE DROPPING WINDOW, LACK OF SECURITY WHEN PARKING THE CAR/AT A STOP, WEATHER (RAIN, HAIL, SNOW, ETC.), DRIVERS STARTLED BY THE DROP AND ATTEMPTING TO ASSESS THE SITUATION WHILE DRIVING, ETC.

THE DOOR ALSO BECAME JAMMED AND I WAS UNABLE TO OPEN IT FROM EITHER THE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS HAPPENED TO THE OTHER BACK WIDOW JUST 9 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. AT THAT TIME I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP, AND PAID TO HAVE IT FIXED.I HAVE READ SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS HAPPENING IN THE JEEP LIBERTY. THE ISSUE IS A CHEAP, PLASTIC PART USED IN THE WINDOW REGULATOR. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW, AND CHRYSLER WILL ONLY REPLACE THIS PART WITH ANOTHER CHEAP PLASTIC PART, RATHER THAN USING A STURDIER METAL PART. THIS IS AN EXPENSE ISSUE AS WELL AS A SAFETY ISSUE. THE NOISE THE WINDOW MAKES WHEN IT FALLS IS VERY DISTRACTING. ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS SHOULD BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES, AND THE DRIVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE WINDOWS, IN ORDER TO AVOID DANGEROUS DEBRIS FLYING INTO THE CAR, NOT TO MENTION HAVING SOME CONTROL OVER OUTSIDE ELEMENTS. (WEATHER) CHRYSLER REALLY SHOULD DO A RECALL, AND STOP CHARGING JEEP OWNERS TO FIX WHAT IS THEIR FAULT IN THE FIRST PLACE-IT IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE JEEP LIBERTY. MANY REPORTS FROM JEEP OWNERS MENTION THIS HAPPENING TO THE SAME WINDOW, OR MULTIPLE WINDOWS OVER AND OVER. THERE OUGHT TO BE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST CHRYSLER. *TR",

THEN MY FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW BEGAN TO MAKE A SIMILAR SOUND.  HOWEVER, WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ROLL IT BACK UP 2 WEEKS AGO IT WOULD NOT COME ALL THE WAY UP.  AS I PRESSED ON THE WINDOW BUTTON FOR A FEW SECONDS THIS COIL CAME UP FROM INSIDE THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW WOULD NOT GO UP ANY FARTHER.  SO, I HAD A MECHANIC FRIEND OPEN THE DOOR TO CHECK OUT THE PROBLEM AND HE SAID THE FOAM PIECE (REGULATOR) WAS BROKEN.  ANOTHER FRIEND AND I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS NUMEROUS UNSATISFIED CUSTOMERS WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUE!  I GOT THE NUMBER OF A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE PERSON LOOKED UP MY VIN TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY RECALLS ON MY LIBERTY.  TO MY DISMAY THERE ARE NONE.  SO, HIS GUESS TO FIX MY PROBLEM WOULD BE $300 - 600...FOR ONE WINDOW!!  THERE'S NO WAY I'M ABLE TO PAY FOR EVEN HALF OF THAT OUTRAGEOUS COST!  WITH ONE WINDOW OUT OF COMMISSION, THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOW IS STILL GARGLING AT ME SO I TRY NOT TO USE IT.

IT WAS IMMEDIATELY TOWED TO THE MECHANIC, AND THEY DIAGNOSED A BROKEN VALVE SPRING, AND SAID IT'S AN EXTREMELY RARE OCCURRENCE FOR A VEHICLE THIS AGE.  IT?S A 2003 JEEP LIBERTY WITH 91000 MILES.  OTHER THAN THE VALVE SPRING, THE ENGINE IS IN GREAT CONDITION. THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT REPLACING IT BECAUSE HE FEELS IT COULD BE A FACTORY DEFECT, AND THERE?S ANOTHER SPRING VALVE, SO WE'RE DECIDING WHETHER TO REPLACE BOTH, OR THE WHOLE ENGINE.   IN RESEARCHING WE'VE FOUND THIS SEEMS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH LIBERTY'S 2002-2005, AND I ASSUME ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WRITING ABOUT IT.  THE MECHANICS TALKED TO SAY THEY'VE SEEN IT BEFORE IN THE LIBERTY'S TOO.  A GOOD SITE FOR COMMENTS ABOUT THE LIBERTY'S IS HTTP://WWW.CARSURVEY.ORG/REVIEWS/JEEP/LIBERTY/R95082/COMMENTS/.  ALSO FOUND; 1)REPLACEMENT PARTS LISTED  ARE REFURBISHED, OR NEW.  THERE'S NO REFURBISHED AVAILABLE, ONLY NEW.  COULD MEAN THERE'S A FLAW SO THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO REFURBISH THE OLD ONES, BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, SO A NEW ONE, WITH BETTER COMPONENTS ARE THE ONLY ONES AVAILABLE. 2)I STATED THE FLAW SEEMS TO APPEAR 2002-2005, AND WHEN LOOKING AT THE VALVE SPRING  2003 PART# VS 2006 PART#, 2006 THE NUMBER CHANGED, WHICH MIGHT MEAN THEY FIGURED IT OUT, AND PUT THE UPDATED PART IN THE 2006 MODEL.  IT SEEMS TO BE THE INTAKE VALVE, NOT EXHAUST VALVE WITH DEFECT, AND IN THE 2003/2006 PART NUMBERS THE INTAKE# IS DIFFERENT, BUT EXHAUST# IS THE SAME. I CALLED JEEPS NAT'L CUSTOMER COMPLAINT CENTER, FILED COMPLAINT, WAS GIVEN THE RUNAROUND, AND WAS TOLD BECAUSE MY MECHANIC WAS NOT CHRYSLER, THEY COULDN'T TRUST HIS FINDINGS.  I WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD MY CAR WAS OLD, YET ALOT OF PEOPLE REPORTED THE SAME THING; THEIR MECHANICS SAY IT?S A VERY RARE OCCURRENCE THAT A VALVE SPRING BREAKS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MILEAGES BEING REPORTED.   *TR",

OHIO IS A SALT BELT STATE, AND AKRON AND THE EASTERN SUBURBS OF CLEVELAND EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER THAN OTHER AREAS OF OHIO DUE TO LAKE EFFECT.

ON DECEMBER 17, 2007 NHTSA OPENED PRELIMINARY EVALUATION PE07-Q62 FOR 2002 -2003 JEEP LIBERTYS BASED ON COMPLAINTS OF FRONT SUSPENSION UPPER BALL JOINT SEPARATION.  ON APRIL 7, 2009, CHRYSLER NOTIFIED THE NHTSA THAT '[T]HE FRONT SUSPENSION UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT [OF 2003 JEEP LIBERTYS] MAY EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF LUBRICATION WHICH CAN LEAD TO CORROSION, ACCELERATED WEAR, AND POSSIBLE SEPARATION WHILE DRIVING[,]' AND AGREED TO 'CONDUCT A SAFETY RECALL TO REPLACE THE FRONT UPPER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLIES ON ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES.' ADDITIONALLY, CHRYSLER STATED THAT '[T]HE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ALLEGED SEPARATIONS OCCURRED IN SALT BELT STATES. A REVIEW OF SOME RETURNED PARTS INDICATED COMPROMISED SEALING, LOSS OF LUBRICATION WHICH RESULTED IN CORROSION, ACCELERATED WEAR AND SEPARATION.'

IT APPEARS THAT NO TWO SITUATIONS ARE HANDLED THE SAME WAY BASED ON THE JEEP FORUMS I'VE VIEWED AND BASED ON MY EXPERIENCES.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST BE CONSISTENT, BUT I BELIEVE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH CSR YOU TALK WITH.  YESTERDAY'S CSR TOLD ME THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SAME AS A CUSTOMER WHO PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH ITS STANDARD $100 DEDUCTIBLE.  THE CSR EARLIER THIS YEAR ON THE $25 CO-PAY TOLD ME THAT  CHARGE WAS SO THEY COULD WARRANT THE PART FOR 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES AND FIX IT FREE OF CHARGE SHOULD THE PART GO BAD AGAIN.  OBVIOUSLY, CHRYSLER KNOWS THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM HERE--IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A TSB ON THIS ISSUE.  I UNDERSTAND THEY NOW REPLACE THE WINDOW ALONG WITH THE REGULATOR BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A DESIGN CHANGE IN HOW THE REGULATOR ATTACHES TO THE WINDOW--SO THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM (BUT NO RECALL).  THOSE WHO ARE PAYING FULL PRICE FOR REPAIR ARE BUYING A NEW WINDOW, TOO--AS IF THE COST TO REPLACE THE REGULATOR ISN'T EXPENSIVE ENOUGH.

NEVER HEARD OF THAT, I WAS TOLD THAT METAL PARTICLES WHERE IN THE OIL PAN AND THAT THE NOISE WILL CONTINUE BUT THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER.  MONTHS LATER I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO  HAVE THAT SAME REAR AXLE OIL CHANGED AND WAS TOLD THAT I DO NOT NEED TO DO THAT AGAIN.  NOW 6 MONTHS LATER THE CARS AXLE FALLS OUT.  WHAT IS UP WITH THAT.

THE DESCRIPTION ON THE REPAIR BILL IS \"BALL JOINT CAME OUT OF UPPER CONTROL ARM.  REPLACED RT FRONT UPPER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY.\"    I TRIED CALLING JEEP'S CORPORATE OFFICE (3/14/08 AT 10:45AM) PER THE DEALER RECOMMENDATION.  THE CORPORATE PERSON SAID IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SHE VERY RUDE AND REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO ASSIST.  WHEN I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE PERSON'S SUPERVISOR SHE REFUSED SAYING THEY SHE WAS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.     MY GREATEST FEAR IS THAT IF I WAS ON MY NORMAL DAILY COMMUTE OF 70 MILES ON THE FREEWAY AND THE WHEEL SNAPPED OFF, THEN I PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE TYPING THIS MESSAGE TODAY.  THE CAR WOULD HAVE EASILY FLIPPED.  I HAVE THE OLD PART AND IT IS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW.  I WISH JEEP CORPORATION WAS MORE RESPONSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS FAILURE.  OF NOTE, IS THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE VEHICLE IN 2006 FOR THE BALL JOINTS CAUSING LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL. I HAD THAT REPAIR COMPLETED IN 2006.

THEY HAD OUR VEHICLE FOR ABOUT A WEEK.  WE TRIED TO BE PATIENT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO NOT HAVE THE USE OF OUR VEHICLE FOR THIS AMOUNT OF TIME.  WE GOT THE JEEP BACK AND NOW THE TRANSMISSION HAS GONE AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE WAS BUCKING AND SMELLED LIKE IT WAS ON FIRE.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT IF HE HAD CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT THAT DAY, IT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ON FIRE.  WE CALLED THE SAME DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE IT RIGHT AWAY.  WHEN WE DID DROP IT OFF, IT SAT THERE BEFORE THEY COULD LOOK AT IT.  THEY SAID IT WAS A FAULTY PART IN THE TRANSMISSION AND AGAIN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT THREE WEEKS FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION, BUT THE PART COULD BE ORDERED AND SENT BY FEDERAL EXPRESS.  WE CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS VEHICLE AGAIN FOR THREE WEEKS SO WE CHOSE THE REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  I CALLED TODAY, AND THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE PART AND HAVEN'T CALLED ME BACK WITH WHERE IT IS.  I CALLED JEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID MAYBE THEY COULD OFFER \"GOODWILL ASSISTANCE\" WITH A LOANER VEHICLE, BUT THEN SAID NO BECAUSE IT IS NOT COVERED IN OUR WARRANTY AND WE ARE OVER IN MILEAGE, EVEN THOUGH OUR JEEP IS NOT 7 YEARS OLD AND DOES NOT HAVE 70,000 MILES ON IT.  *JB",

THE SUSPENSION CAUGHT ON THE RIM OF THE TIRE AND I WAS BARELY ABLE TO GET THE CAR MOST OF THE WAY OFF THE ROAD.  THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AFTER THAT.  I HAD TO CALL A TOW-TRUCK AND HE WAS ABLE TO DRAG THE JEEP ONTO A FLAT-BED AND TRANSPORT THE JEEP TO A LOCAL DEALER.  THE DEALER WAS OUTSTANDING(PETER KOCH IN SENECA FALLS, NY)!  THEY HAD AN EMERGENCY SET OF BALL-JOINTS AND WERE ABLE TO FIX MY CAR THAT AFTERNOON.  THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT RIM WAS RUINED AND THE DEALER INSTRUCTED ME TO HAVE IT REPLACED.  THE DEALER USED THE SPARE RIM DURING THE REPAIR.  MY CONCERN IS THAT 15 MINUTES EARLIER I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE NY STATE THROUGH WAY AND CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THIS JOINT FAILED AT 65 MILE PER HOUR.  I HAVE BEEN ON THE WAITING LIST AT MY LOCAL DEALER FOR AT LEAST THREE MONTHS AND MAY BE EVEN 6 MONTHS FOR THIS RECALL REPAIR!  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  I CHECKED WITH MY LOCAL DEALER THIS MORNING AND I AM NUMBER 31 ON THE RECALL LIST - THE DEALER SAID THAT THEY RECEIVE BETWEEN ZERO AND 3 SETS PER WEEK.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  JEEP SHOULD STOP PRODUCING NEW VEHICLES UNTIL THIS POTENTIAL LIFE-THREATENING DEFECT HAS BEEN FIXED IN THE JEEPS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED.  I HAVE SEEN THIS DEFECT DESCRIBED AS A LOOSENING OF THE BALL-JOINT.  I BELIEVE THAT TO BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.  THIS PART FAILS AND THE RESULT OF A FAILURE CAN BE CATASTROPHIC. *JB",

HE SAID THEY WOULD CONTACT ME AS SOON AS THE PART CAME IN. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS AND I HAVE YET TO BE CONTACTED. RECALLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IS THIS \"SHORTAGE\" OF PARTS REALLY THE PROBLEM OR IT MY LOCAL DEALER.  MY SECOND ISSUE IS THAT OF THE FLOOR SHIFTER. THE LAST TWO TIMES I DROVE MY JEEP, IT REFUSED TO GO INTO PARK OR 1ST GEAR. I TRIED PRESSING HARDER ON THE BUTTON ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE SHIFTER, TURNING MY VEHICLE OFF, AND GIVING IT FORCE. THE FIRST TIME I ENDED UP DRIVING TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO COULDN'T GET IT INTO PARK AT FIRST EITHER, AFTER GIVING IT SOME FORCE IT WENT IN, HOWEVER HE SEEMED TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE AND TOLD ME TO \"MAKE SURE I PRESS THE BUTTON IN WHEN TRYING TO PUT IT INTO PARK.\" IT HAPPENED THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN I WAS PARKING IN FRONT OF MY HOME. I STRUGGLED FOR 15 MINUTES, THEN DROVE AROUND THE BLOCK AND TRIED AGAIN. I WENT INTO PARK ALTHOUGH NOT SMOOTHLY. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE DEALER TOMORROW. I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS ISSUE AND WOULD IT BE COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY. I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH DEALERS, THEREFORE I AM DREADING HAVING TO TAKE MY JEEP AND PAY FOR A \"DEFECT\". PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THESE ISSUES, LET ME KNOW.

TRYING TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM REVEALED THERE WOULD BE AN 8 WEEK WAIT BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. I LEARNED FROM THE DEALER (AND LATER VERIFIED BY CALLING DAIMLER CHRYSLER AT 1.800.853.1403) THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER IS MAKING ONLY 3 REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE TO DEALERS PER WEEK! IF THIS IS SUCH A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION, DOESN'T DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE MORE PARTS AVAILABLE TO DEALERS OF THEIR DEFECTIVE CARS? I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF CARS, BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I AM DRIVING A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE WHICH I WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE FOR ANOTHER 8 WEEKS. HOW CAN SUCH A HUGE CORPORATION NOT INSURE THAT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEIR DEALERS IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION? WHAT HAPPENS IF INDEED A CRASH OCCURS WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING DURING THAT WAITING PERIOD? WHAT WILL DAIMLER CHRYSLER SAY AND DO THEN? THIS IS A SHAMEFUL EXAMPLE OF VIOLATING THE PUBLIC TRUST-AND THIS CAR IS NOT CHEAP-THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING-HOLD YOUR PAYMENTS UNTIL THE CAR IS REPAIRED. WHAT CAN I DO BUT WAIT?*JB",

I CALLED FOUR DEALERSHIPS WITHIN MY DRIVING AREA (35MILES) NOT ONE OF THEM OFFERED TO TAKE MY NAME, NUMBER OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION. I WAS TOLD ABOUT THE PARTS BEING ON BACK ORDER AND TO CALL BACK IN A WEEK OR 2. THIS IS WHAT I DID AND AGAIN WAS TOLD THE SAME I AGAIN CALLED D/C AND THE CUSTOMER REP TOLD ME AGAIN ABOUT THE PARTS BEING BACK ORDERED AND THAT EACH DEALER ONLY RECEIVED 1-2 A WEEK, THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SHE COULD DO. WELL I HAVE BEEN CALLING EVERY WEEK SINCE FRIDAY THE 27TH OF OCTOBER AND FINALLY ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER 30TH A SERVICE PERSON WAS WILLING TO TAKE MY NAME AND PUT IT ON A WAITING LIST.  BUT MY QUESTION IS FOR HOW LONG?  MY AUTO IS MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION AS LIKE OTHERS, SHOULD I HAVE AN ACCIDENT WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR OR ANY INCIDENT AT ALL WITH THEN IN THE CAR, DAIMLER CHRYSLER WILL NOT HAVE HEARD THE LAST OF ME. I HAVE ALREADY HAD TO REPLACE 2 FRONT TIRES FOR REASONS NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN (THEY HAD WORN SO BAD ON THE INNER TREAD) AND HAVE BEEN KEEPING CLOSE EYE ON THE NEW ONES. CAN'T AFFORD TIRES B/F THEY ARE NEEDED EITHER. AND WILL THE DEALER MAKE SURE MY CAR IS ALIGNED AND BALANCED? SINCE THIS WILL BE DISRUPTED BY THE REPAIR OF THE LOWER BALL JOINTS? I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE, I HAVE LOVED MY LIBERTY SINCE BUYING IT AND MY SON IS LOOKING FORWARD TO DRIVING IT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT DO I ALLOW HIM TO? THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOU HELP AND TIME.

THE VEHICLE PULLS STRONGLY TO THE RIGHT WHERE IT DID NOT BEFORE THE TIRE REPLACEMENT, THE VEHICLE FEELS MUSHY AT FREEWAY SPEEDS AND IS NOW VERY HARD TO KEEP GOING IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  THE FEELING OF LACK OF CONTROL IS ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE WHEN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A LEFT TURN AT SPEED (THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO WANT TO CONTINUE TO GO STRAIGHT OR LEFT AND, VERY NOTICEABLE UNDER STEER IS PRESENT).  THE JEEP FEELS VERY UNSETTLED EVERYTIME THE GRADE ON THE ROAD CROWN CHANGES ALONG TURNS ON BACK ROADS AND IS NOTICEABLE ENOUGH TO COMPEL ME TO SLOW DOWN FROM NORMAL SPEED LIMITS.  WHEN TRAVELING 55 MPH AND ABOVE THE FEELING OF LOSS OF CONTROL COMES ON WITH VERY MINOR CHANGES ON STRAIGHT ROAD SURFACES.  THERE IS ALSO VIBRATION AND NOISE COMING FROM THE RIGHT FRONT AREA OF THE SUSPENSION (COMES AND GOES IN PROPORTION TO LOSS OF CONTROL).  THE VEHICLE HAS 70,000 MILES AND IS ON ITS' THIRD SET OF THESE TIRES (THE ONLY ONE THAT FITS THE ODDBALL STANDARD RIM) BUT, THIS IS THE FIRST SET OF THESE TIRES THAT HAVE LEFT ME NOT WANTING TO USE THE TRUCK FOR ANYTHING.

I HAD THE DEALER LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AND THEY KEPT IT FOR 4 DAYS (AND 100 MILES) SAYING AFTERWARDS THAT IT NEEDED ONLY A WHEEL ALIGNMENT (TOE-IN WAS OUT) AFTER STATING THAT IT WAS ALRIGHT WHEN THE SOLD ME THE TIRES 3 DAYS EARLIER; THEY ALSO CHECKED THEIR WHEEL BALANCING JOB AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  THEY WENT ON THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY SUSPENSION COMPONENTS AND THAT MY TRUCK BEHAVED LIKE MANY OTHER LIBERTYS.
