What stopped the momentum was another car, my car crashed into caused extensive damage  to that car( it was totaled) .  The second time; I turned the wheels to back-in as I had a several times into my driveway. The car was to far over, but because I was not centered enough in the driveway, I moved forward to realign myself. The  car seemed to hesitate  as I moved forward, before putting  it in reverse.  I Put the car in reverse, lightly hit gas the car seem to take off  as if it was a rocket backing up into driveway and went through the back wall of my garage ( because there was so much snow it came to a stop). My daughter was observed on the ring camera. I have been very sensitive to making sure since first time to be more aware. It is significant to note prior to this occurrence my car did this in smaller spurts ,( but did not think anything of it , I took my car in for all of the checks) but  I was able to control it  by putting foot on brake, It's like this time the engine revved up on its own. This time the car was totaled. ( The back window shattered. A lot of damage underneath the car. I will not be buying another Subaru. It was my dream car:(. I was very traumatized.)I was diligent with the maintenance of the car. I informed my insurance company.",

The shifter is in park and there is no steering wheel lock or anything else that might ordinarily prevent the vehicle from being turned off. This process is no different from every other time I've turned the vehicle off previously.   To finally retrieve the key, the car needs to be restarted numerous times (often 1-3 more times) while trying a combination of moving the steering wheel, putting the shifter into drive and back into park, and/or releasing the brake pedal and reapplying it firmly.

I must repeatedly depress the shift lever and/or shift gears back and forth and/or restart and turn off the car in order to get the key out. This has been going on for two months now for at least half the time although not every time I turn off the car. There are no warning messages or diagnostic lights, just the malfunction itself. The issue has been documented in TSB 16-112-18 in numerous models of Subaru. My spouse and I have contacted Subaru of America and a local Subaru dealer, who have disclaimed responsibility for the problem, but did admit that this was a known issue. The dealer also insinuated that the fault could be the customers' by spilling beverages or something into the shifter linkage. As indicated in the YouTube printout I have attached (Yakfish Taco 2014 - 2018 Subaru Forester Key Stuck in Ignition - Quick fix solution), many people are working around this problem by disabling the key removal safety feature in the wiring of the steering column. This allows the key to be removed from the ignition at any time, such as when the vehicle is driving or stopped but not in Park. It is my belief that people are going to die from this. Subaru should be forced to issue a recall.",

This occurred while the vehicle was parked and these indicators came on when the engine was switched on.     When driving a noticeable decrease in engine performance and louder exhaust noise was evident.  Took vehicle to dealer and subsequently was informed that there was a complete four valve engine failure that would require a complete overhaul of engine at an extremely high cost.  The safety issue would be if this had occurred at highway speeds potentially  losing control of vehicle causing accident.    This was the second time this has occurred with this particular vehicle.  When purchased new in 2016 after roughly 38k miles  engine  failed and had to be rebuilt at dealer cost.  This current failure occurred at just under 101k miles, so this second failure occured at approximately 60k miles after first repair.  This indicates to  me that:  1. Poor engine quality, 2. Poor repair parts, 3. Poor quality control at the factory, 4, Poor repair service.    As of writing of this complaint vehicle is still at the dealer  undergoing repair which according to service rep will take a few days.  We believe the cost of this repair should lay at the feet of Subaru for producing a defective engine.",

So much so, that Subaru put out a service bulletin (Bulletin Number: 16-112-18R) to remedy this.  Unfortunately, those who are out of the warranty time frame, are no longer eligible for a replacement without charge.  This is not a safety issue per-say, but rather an issue of the car possibly getting stole due to Subaru's unwillingness to make this a recall issue and making it free to current owners regardless of the warranty status.  What I would like for you folks to do is push subaru's hand into making this a recall issue and fixing the issue free of charge even if the vehicle is outside of the warranty time period.

The 2016 subaru impreza has the same fuel pump that later motels have and they where recalled due to the fuel not being delivered correctly from the fuel tank to the engine. it is typically winter fuels that make the fuel pump fail. (there is a handful of information on other websites)  The safety issue is that the car will shut off and is difficult to get started again. this happens when the car has about 2 gallons left in the tank or 50 ish miles to empty. this situation has happened to me three (3) times on the highway at about 70 miles an hour. this also happens most commonly in the winter due to the available fuel. this is also a safety issue because the car has NO heat and you could be stranded with a baby and this could become life threatening.   This problem has been reported on other websites and reproduced in my car 3 times. When I got my car towed to a Kia dealer (closest one) they said it was a mechanical issue with the fuel system.   The Kia dealer told me that the issue is due to winter fuel and low pressure in the fuel line. they recommended that I keep my car at or above 100 miles to empty. (so far they are correct)   This issue doesn't trigger any warning lamps / lights, or set any codes off. The car will just shut off and you will have to get more pressure into the fuel system.",
