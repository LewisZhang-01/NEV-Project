        "summary": "This has happened several times in the couple months ive owned the car, the scariest incident involving the transmission slipping and the car losing power was after having to stop on the shoulder of i95 highway this was the first time i had even given it more than the reasonable rate of pedel pressure or \"gas\" and im expecting to get up to speed to merge back into the flow of traffic however right at 45-50mph as im merging into the far right lane of the highway the engine just screams out and rpms max out the car slows rapidly. This is becoming more and more frequent and also theres times we take for granted when we need that engine to work to either get out of an intersesction, merge into traffic, use the cars power as a preventative measure to stay safe in various environments. Driving through baltimore city, a group of young men surrounded my car a week ago and start giving it an entire washing , mind youu im at a red light, but theyve got buckets and soapy rags sudz everywhere and when it turns green the older looking of them screams \"50 bucks explicit explicit \" \" I know you got it\" i dont have a dollar on me just my credit cards and also my  little neice penelope. i see an opening and floor it but instantly engine winds all the way up , its just ravving out the boy throws a rock cracking my windshield , the crack is aligned with my face so imagine my anxiety levels trying to explain to my sister penelopes mother what had her daughter screaming and crying . So in short the transmission has been a nightmare and I would love to see a recall or some other recourse for me. I am a new owner , i have seen there was a lawsuit awhile back, i took the car to Jone Nissan in Beliar MD after they sweat talked me into bringing my car right away saying things like man are you lucky, and your still udner warranty , your getting a new transmission compliments of nissan, just hyping me up to the tone of take a loaner car and we're fix everything free of charge.
