Pulled over and stopped until rain stopped. After looking in engine compartment the hardware that connects both wiper arms to the motor broke off from where the wipers arms connect. No indication of failure until both arms just broke off. Looks like they broke because of stress moving the wipers across windshield. Not sure if poor design of poor metal used.",
