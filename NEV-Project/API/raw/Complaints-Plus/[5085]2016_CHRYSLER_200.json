The first two times modesto jeep dodge chrysler determined it was too low on oil (but the mileage was much less than when oil change was due according to my oil change sticker. Also very dangerous because there is never an oil light that comes on the dashboard to warn oil low. About 3 months ago it died 500 miles before oil change supposed to be due. Tonight it died again with no warning. Oil change is not supposed to be due for another 1000 miles. Very scary. No warning light. 2.

THE CAR STARTED TO SLOW DOWN WHILE I PRESSING THE GAS, COMING TO A HALT BEFORE MY FRONT WHEELS COULD GO ON THE DRIVE-WAY. I PRESSED THE BRAKES BUT THEY WERE HARD WHERE I COULD NOT PRESS DOWN ON THEM AND I LET THEM GO. I PRESSED DOWN ON THEM AGAIN HOPING THEY WOULD WORK, BUT THEY WERE HARD. AT THAT POINT THE CAR SOUNDED LIKE IT TURNED OFF ON ME EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN ON MY IGNITION READ \"RUN\". I LOOK DOWN AND MY GEAR IS ON \"D\" BUT FLASHING ON AND OFF. AT THIS POINT I AM STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL STREET (SIDEWAYS) BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. I LOOK AT THE SCREEN IN MY DASHBOARD AND ITS FLASHING SOMETHING ABOUT \"SHIFT\" AND THE BATTERY LIGHT IS ON. I WAS PANICKING SO I DID NOT FULLY READ WHAT IT WAS FLASHING AND FORTUNATELY WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE GEAR TO \"P\" EVEN THOUGH I COULD NOT PRESS DOWN THE BRAKES BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY STIFF. I TURNED OFF MY CAR, AND RESTARTED IT. AT THAT POINT MY CAR WORKED LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. I KNOW MY CAR IN A WEIRD WAY TURNED ITSELF OFF BECAUSE MY A/C WAS NOT BLOWING COOL AIR ANYMORE (WINDSHIELD WAS STARTING TO FOG BECAUSE OF THE RAIN) UNTIL I RESTARTED THE CAR. I WILL SAY THAT A FEW MONTHS PRIOR MY \"PARKING BRAKE\" TURNED ON ON ITS OWN, AND I HAD MISTAKENLY THOUGHT I HAD DONE IT EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOT TOUCHED IT. I WAS ADJUSTING MY CAR INTO A PARKING SPOT AND HAD JUST CHANGED FROM \"R\" TO \"D\".",

WE PULLED THE CAR OFF AT THE CHURCH JUST 1 BLOCK DOWN THE ROAD, GOT OUT AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED, NO ANIMALS HAD HIT THE CAR, NO OBJECTS WAS LAYING IN THE ROAD, AND NO ONE WAS MOWING, BUT WE HAD A STRAIGHT GASH WITH A DENT IN THE SIDE OF OUR REAR PASSENGER DOOR. IT WAS GETTING CLOSE TO DUSK AND I THOUGHT SOMETHING CAME OFF THE CAR. THE NEXT MORNING I FINALLY NOTICED THE PASSENGER FRONT WHEEL HAD THE LUG NUT MISSING AND THE STUD WAS GONE. THE RIMS CLEAR COAT IS SCRATCHED WHERE IT FELL OFF AND SLUNG BACK AND HIT THE SIDE OF OUR CAR. I CALLED OUR LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND COME TO FIND OUT IT HAD BOLTS NOT STUDS. I HAD THEM ORDER ONE FORM ME. I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER WHAT THE CORRECT TORQUE WAS FOR THE BOLTS, INCASE ANY OTHERS WERE LOOSE. HE SAID,\"103 FT/LBS\". I CHECK THE TORQUE THE REST OF THE LUG BOLTS AND COME TO FIND EVERY FRONT ONE WAS LOOSE. 1 MORE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AND 2 ON THE DRIVERS SIDE TOOK NEARLY A 1/4 TURN TO REACH TORQUE. THE REST OF THE FRONT BOLTS WERE AROUND 1/8 TURN FROM BEING TORQUED. I ONLY FOUND 1 ON THE REAR THAT WASN'T CORRECTLY TORQUED. I HAVEN'T SEEN BOLT LUGS ON AN AMERICAN CAR IN ALL MY LIFE. I HAD THE DEALER INSTALL THE NEW BOLT AND HAD HIM DOUBLE CHECK THE TORQUE ON THE OTHERS. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM. I ALSO CALLED THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM AND DROVE IT DOWN FOR HIM TO GET PICTURES AS WELL OF THE DAMAGE. THE DEALER CONTACTED THE REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER AS WELL ABOUT THE PROBLEM.
