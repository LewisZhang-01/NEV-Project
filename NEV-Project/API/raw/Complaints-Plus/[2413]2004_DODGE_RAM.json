I do not believe that this is a coincidence, I believe this is a manufacturer fault that needs to answer to and possibly pay back everyone effected by this event. The auto shop I have the truck at is Lott's auto in Junction City, KS and they themselves know of this fault as well. This needs to be answered to, it is a safety issue and a waste of money to people who trust Dodge with these vehicles, the auto shop informed me this is with the 5.7 HEMI from all years between 2000-2011.

I WAS ON A HIGHWAY GOING 55 MPH WITH VEHICLES ALL AROUND ME WHEN THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED.       NOW I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT 2005 DODGE RAMS 1500 SERIES THAT WERE MANUFACTURED WITHIN THE DATES OF JAN 28TH 2004-AUG. 3RD 2005 ARE ALL A PART OF THIS TYPE OF RECALL, KNOWN AS P77 RECALL.  WHAT ABOUT DODGE RAM 2004 1500 SERIES THAT WERE MANUFACTURED IN JUNE OF 2004.  THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME TIME THAT THE 2005'S WOULD HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED.  I AM QUESTIONING WHY AREN'T THE 2004 DODGE RAM 1500 SERIES TRUCKS UNDER THIS SAME P77 RECALL SINCE THEY WERE STILL BEING MANUFACTURED WITHIN THIS SAME TIME PERIOD OF THE 2005'S.  WHY HASN'T CHRYSLER/DODGE CORP. LOOKED INTO THE 2004 DODGE RAM 1500 SERIES TRUCKS THAT MAY HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM DUE TO BEING MANUFACTURED IN THIS SAME TIME PERIOD?      ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE ENCOUNTERED, IS I AM BEING TOLD BY AUTO PARTS SALE ASSOCIATES THAT THEY CAN NOT SELL ME THIS DRIVE SHAFT OR REAR AXLE DUE TO MY TRUCK BEING UNDER THIS P77 RECALL. THOUGH, WHEN I CHECK MY VIN NUMBER UNDER FCA RECALL LOOK UP, I ONLY SEE THE R25 RECALL FOR THE DRIVER AIR BAG INFLATOR, WHICH I AT THIS POINT I CAN'T EVEN GET THIS RECALL REPAIRED BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A WORKING DRIVE SHAFT OR REAR AXLE TO EVEN MOVE MY TRUCK. IT SEEMS AS IF MY TRUCK WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS P77 RECALL, THOUGH I AM BEING TOLD IT IS UNDER RECALL.  CONFUSED!?",

IT HAS HAPPENED AS I AM ENTERING OFF-RAMPS AND PROCEEDING THROUGH INTERSECTIONS.     THE PROBLEM IS THE VAPOR/LIQUID SEPARATOR VALVE LOCATED AT THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. THE VALVE IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT LIQUID FUEL FROM ENTERING THE CHARCOAL CANISTER/EMISSIONS SYSTEM. WHEN THE VALVE FAILS, LIQUID GAS CAN ENTER THE LINE AND FILL THE CHARCOAL CANISTER.     AFTER REFUELING, THE PCM ON THE VEHICLE DETECTS A CHANGE IN FUEL LEVEL. THEN, WHEN THE ENGINE MEETS CERTAIN TEMPERATURE AND DRIVING CRITERIA, THE PCM ISSUES A PURGE COMMAND TO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER TO REMOVE THE STORED GAS VAPORS. IT?S AT THAT POINT THAT ALL THE LIQUID GAS IN THE LINE GETS SUCKED INTO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. THE PCM EXPECTS TO SEE GAS VAPORS ENTERING THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND IT IS PREPARED TO ADJUST AIR/FUEL MIXTURES TO COMPENSATE. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PREPARED TO SEE LIQUID GAS COMING INTO THE INTAKE. THAT?S WHAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL.    UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY FIX IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE GAS TANK. CHRYSLER DOES NOT SELL THE VAPOR/LIQUID VALVE AS A SEPARATE UNIT. ONCE THE TANK IS REPLACED AND THE CHARCOAL CANISTER PURGED, THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.      THIS PROBLEM IS WELL-KNOWN TO CHRYSLER ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF VEHICLES, INCLUDING PICKUPS, MINIVANS AND SUVS. CHRYSLER SETTLED WITH COMPLAINANTS ON SOME MODELS AND YEARS BY AGREEING TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO LIFETIME, BUT REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OUTSIDE OF THOSE VEHICLES. I AM LOOKING AT A $1,300 REPAIR BILL FOR A KNOWN DEFECTIVE AND UNSAFE PART, THE REPLACEMENT FOR WHICH CHRYSLER REFUSES TO SELL SEPARATE FROM THE GAS TANK ITSELF.

VEHICLE WILL START RIGHT UP WITH NO PROBLEM BUT BATTERY GAUGE TAKES A FEW SECONDS TO RISE TO OPERATING LEVELS. TRANSMISSION ALSO FEELS LIKE IT WANTS TO SLIP AT TIME OF STALL.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT BECAUSE A CODE WAS NOT THROWN IT IS MY ISSUE TO DEAL WITH (HAVE TO DROP THE GAS TANK AND REPLACE A SENSOR IN THE OVERFLOW TUBE $500 PLUS DOLLARS- WHICH I DO NOT JUST HAVE LYING AROUND). I HAVE AVOIDED TOPPING OFF AT THE PUMP AND HAVE TO WATCH THE AMOUNT OF GALLONS OF FUEL I PUT IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE THE SAME SITUATION OCCUR AGAIN. THIS IS NOT A VALID FIX IN MY OPINION. I CAN SEE THE SITUATION EXISTS WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME YEAR OF MY VEHICLE AS WELL. WHY IS THIS NOT BEING ADDRESSED?!?! THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND NOT TO MENTION VERY FRUSTRATING AND DANGEROUS. I HAVE MY 3 CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH ME MOST OF THE TIME AND I CRINGE EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS JUST PRAYING WE DONOT GET HIT.   *TR",

AFTER RESEARCH, I FOUND DODGE KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IN THE 2004 HEMI ENGINE.   IN FACT, THEY REDESIGNED THE VALVE SPRINGS IN THE 2005 MODELS.   SEVERAL SITES & BLOGS SHOWED OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT DODGE NEVER STARTED A CAMPAIGN OR ISSUED A RECALL.  I CONTACTED CHRYSLER (DODGE) AND THEY REFUSE TO ASSIST OR ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM.   IF THIS HAD OCCURRED ON A BUSY INTERSTATE, I COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  WHEN THE ENGINE FAILED, I LOST POWER STEERING AND ANY ABILITY TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE.   IF NEEDED, I HAVE ALL DOCUMENTATION, AND I ALSO HAVE THE BROKEN VALVE SPRING IN MY POSSESSION.    *TR",

I BEGAN TO HEAD HOME WITH THE TRUCK AS I DID NOT WANT A SAFETY HAZARD WHERE I COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE. I ALSO NOTICED THAT IN ORDER TO STEER STRAIGHT, I HAD TO HOLD MY STEERING WHEEL APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES LEFT.   UPON GETTING THE TRUCK HOME I IMMEDIATELY SAW MY PROBLEM.  MY FRONT PASSENGER TIRE WAS SITTING IN THE WHEEL WELL ON AN ANGLE.  LARGE AMOUNTS OF SMOKE WERE POURING OUT OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE, AND RUBBER GOO WAS LEAVING A TRAIL WHERE I DROVE. I JACKED THE CAR AND REMOVED THE WHEEL, AND COULD SEE EVEN MORE.  MY WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY WAS SEPARATED AND BROKEN. THIS CAUSED MY TIRE TO SIT ON THE HUB CROOKED AND LEAN AGAINST MY CONTROL ARM.  THE HEAT FROM THIS FRICTION WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT MELTED MY CV BOOT, WHICH IS WHY I HAD A RUBBER GOO TRAIL.  IT ALSO MELTED THE ABS SENSOR ON THE WHEEL HUB ITSELF. CAUSING MY ABS  TO GO OUT. THE HUB ITSELF HAD A PIECE COMPLETELY FALLEN OFF, AS IF A WELD BROKE.  THE HEAT ALSO WARPED MY ROTOR, AND CRACKED MY BRAKE PADS IN THAT SIDE.   LUCKILY, I DID NOT HAVE ANY WHEEL SEPARATION OR TOTAL FAILURE OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM, CAUSING CRASH OR INJURY. I WAS BARELY ABLE TO UTILIZE BRAKING AND DRIVE HOME AT ABOUT 20MPH WITH HAZARDS ON.

I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SO I PULLED THE DIFFERENTIAL COVER OFF AND FOUND WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE SPEED SENSOR IN THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUSING.

THE CARRIER BEARING ALSO HAD A GROVE CUT INTO IT BY THESE CLIPS AS THEY WORKED THEIR WAY OUT.

I REMOVED ALL OF THE METAL C CLIP PIECES AND REMOVED THE REMAINING C CLIPS THAT HAD NOT YET FALLEN OUT.

THERE WERE NOT EVEN ANY WARNING LIGHTS TELLING WE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, I CALLED SOMEONE TO TOW IT HOME THAT NIGHT. I DID THANKFULLY HAVE ANOTHER CAR TO DRIVE. IN THE MONTHS SINCE I HAVE BEEN SLOWLY TEARING THE ENGINE APART WITH MY DAD, THIS WEEK WE FINALLY PULLED THE HEADS AND DISCOVERED THAT MY # 6 PISTON WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED AND HAD PUNCHED A HOLE IN MY BLOCK!

NOTHING I HAVE TRIED HAS FIXED THIS ISSUE AND THE REPAIR SHOPS HAVE FAILED TO DUPLICATE OR DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM.  AFTER CHECKING AROUND I HAVE NOTICED THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND I THINK DODGE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS.  WHENEVER THE ENGINE FAILS I LOSE STEERING AND BRAKES.  LAST WEEK IT STALLED ON THE INTERSTATE WITH NO PULL OFF ROOM AND IT WOULD NOT RESTART FOR SEVERAL MINUTES NEARLY CAUSING A REAR END COLLISION BETWEEN A BIG RIG AND MYSELF.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. *TR",

ON DECEMBER 11TH 2009 I WAS DRIVING TO WORK ON A SMOOTH PAVED ROAD WHEN A HUMMING BEGAN IN THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK.  IN A MATTER OF 1-2 MILES THE PASSENGER FRONT WHEEL BEGAN VIBRATING HARD AND THE VEHICLE STARTED PULLING HARD TO THE RIGHT.  THIS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO LOOSE CONTROL.  I CHECKED THE SUSPENSION THE NEXT DAY AND FOUND THE PASSENGER FRONT HUB BEARING WORN OUT AND SEVERELY LOOSE.  I COULD ROCK THE TIRE 1/4 INCH EACH DIRECTION.  UPON INSPECTING THE HUB THERE WERE NO DARK SPOTS INDICATING GREASE HAD LEAKED OUT. I DISASSEMBLED THE FRONT HUB AND FOUND IT BONE DRY OF GREASE AND RUINED. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME BEARING ASSEMBLY, OR VERY SIMILAR, AS THE 2006 RAM 1500S.  THE FAILURE WAS SUDDEN WITH ONLY A MINOR HUMMING BEFORE SEVERE VIBRATION, WHEEL DRAG, AND ALMOST A LOSS OF STEERING.  THE COST OF PARTS ALONE COST ME APPROXIMATELY $185 AT AN AFTERMARKET PARTS STORE AND $350 AT CHRYSLER.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT CHRYSLER INSTALLED THE SAME TYPE OF DEFECTIVE  BEARINGS IN ALL THE 04,05,06 AND POSSIBLY NEWER RAM 1500 PICKUPS.  NHTSA SHOULD ENFORCE THIS RECALL THROUGH CHRYSLER ON ALL 04,05, AND 06 MODELS BEFORE A FATALITY OCCURS.  BELOW IS THE 2006 RECALL.      2006 DODGE RAM 1500  UNITS AFFECTED:  86333  RECALL NUMBER:  07V038000  SUMMARY:  ON CERTAIN PICKUP TRUCKS, THE FRONT WHEEL BEARING MAY HAVE RECEIVED AN INSUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF GREASE DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.     CONSEQUENCE:  THIS COULD RESULT IN BEARING DEGRADATION, AND IF SUBSEQUENT NOISE AND VIBRATION ARE IGNORED, COULD RESULT IN HUB ASSEMBLY SEPARATION. THIS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL AND CAUSE A CRASH WITHOUT WARNING.     REMEDY:  DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FRONT HUB AND BEARING UNITS. THE RECALL BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 26, 2007.

MY WIFE IS 5' 3\" TALL AND OUR TRUCK IS A DODGE RAM 1500 W/ 20\" RIMS. SO FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE TRUCK ON EITHER SIDE SHE NEEDS THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LEVERAGE HANDLE OR   (THE OH '!@#$% HANDLE) AS WE CALL IT. WHEN SHE PROCEEDED TO PULL HERSELF UP INTO THE SEAT, JUST BEFORE BEING ABLE TO SEAT HERSELF BEHIND THE WHEEL THE LEVERAGE HANDLE CAME OFF THE FRAME OF THE CAB. THE SECOND I REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED I WAS ON MY KNEES BY HER SIDE ASKING HER QUESTIONS TO DETERMINE IF SHE WAS O.K. SHE LANDED ON HER BUTT FIRST THEN HER BACKSIDE AND THEN THE BACK OF HER HEAD HIT THE GROUND. A FRIEND OF OURS WAS THERE TO HEAR HER FALL BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE ACCIDENT BECAUSE HE IS BLIND. I ASKED HIM TO GET A PILLOW FROM THE COUCH SO I COULD PLACE IT UNDER HER HEAD. SHE HAD TO LAY THERE ON THE GROUND FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO GET HER BEARINGS BACK TOGETHER. AFTER SHE WAS ABLE TO SIT UPRIGHT ON THE GROUND I TOOK PICTURES OF EVERYTHING. I STARTED LOOKING AT AND STUDYING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LEVERAGE HANDLE AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS A VERY POOR DESIGN. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS ANCHORING THIS HANDLE TO THE CAB FRAME WAS 2 SMALL BOLTS, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE IN A LEVERAGE HANDLE THAT SUPPORTS  NO LEVERAGE AT ALL. AFTER ABOUT 2 HOURS SHE SAID SHE HAD A MIGRAINE HEADACHE AND HER NECK WAS HURTING. I TOOK HER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN A CAT SCAN, PAIN KILLER AND MUSCLE RELAXER. THE E-ROOM DOCTOR SAID SHE HAS MINOR HEAD INJURY AND CERVICAL NECK STRAIN. THE INJURIES SHE RECEIVED FROM THIS ACCIDENT ARE ALL MINOR AND SHE IS VERY LUCKY HER INJURIES ARE MINOR. WITH ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS, ACCIDENTS, DEATHS AND DEFAULTS I SAW IN THE WEBSITE THAT LEAD ME TO THIS COMPLAINT FORM, IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO GET DAIMLER CHRYSLER TO FIX MY TRUCK. *TR",

MY MECHANIC ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THE PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH AN IMPROPER THROTTLE BODY.  THE REPAIR WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE IMPROPER THROTTLE BODY AND INSTALL A PROPER THROTTLE BODY.  I DID CONTACT MY DODGE DEALERSHIP AND TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, (WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED PER YOUR REQUEST), WHO INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY VIN NUMBER, OF MY TRUCK, BUT WOULD NOT TELL ME IF THEIR WERE ANY RECALLS ON ANY 2003 OR 2004 DODGE RAM 1500 V8.5.7 L ENGINES FOR AN IMPROPER THROTTLE BODY CAUSING STALLING IN COLD TEMPERATURES WHEN COMING TO A STOP AT AN INTERSECTION.

THE THING THAT REALLY GETS ME IS WHEN I CALLED GOODYEAR THE 1ST TIME I WAS TOLD MY WARRANTY WAS UP AFTER A YEAR NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE SAME THING WAS SAID TO ME TODAY WHEN I CALLED ABOUT THE SECOND SET. APPARENTLY JODI FROM GOODYEAR CORP.

ON DEC. 7, 2006 I HAD MY REAR DIFFERENTIAL SERVICED BY AN ASE CERTIFIED FACILITY AFTER READING NUMEROUS POSTINGS ON SEVERAL ONLINE FORUMS DISCUSSING REAR DIFFERENTIAL FAILURES FOR THIS VEHICLE AND AFTER I EXPERIENCED A LOSS IN GENERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUCK.  AS SUSPECTED AND AS DOCUMENTED BY OTHER OWNERS, THE CLUTCH RETAINER CLIPS OF THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL FELL APART IN THE DIFFERENTIAL HOUSING CAUSING THE ENTIRE REAR END TO FAIL.  I AM IN PROCESS OF HAVING ALL MOVING PARTS IN THE HOUSING TO BE REBUILT BY A DRIVETRAIN SPECIALIST AND WILL COST IN EXCESS OF $1000.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE TECHNICIAN SERVICING THE VEHICLE THAT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THIS PROBLEM IF NOT CAUGHT IN EARLY STAGES, CAN CREATE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE REAR END EVENTUALLY LEADING TO LOCK UP.  IN SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 50 MILES PER HOUR THIS CAN CAUSE VEHICLE ROLL OVERS AND TOTAL LOSS OF TOTAL VEHICLE.      THE FACT THAT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER HAS YET TO ISSUE A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS ISSUE IS AGGRAVATING AND SHOWS THEIR LACK OF SYMPATHY FOR THEIR OWNERS AND AS WELL AS OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.

I DROVE MY NEIGHBORS TRUCK WHICH IS THE SAME YEAR 4X4 QUAD CAB AND IT BOUNCED APPROX. 1/4 OF WHAT MINE BOUNCES.  WHEN MY KIDS ARE IN THE BACK IN THEIR CAR SEATS THEY BOUNCE UP AND DOWN APPROX. TWO TO THREE INCHES UP AND DOWN AS I DRIVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  THE AREA I DRIVE IN IS I80 BETWEEN FAIRFIELD AND TRUCKEE, CA.  MY MAIN CONCERN IS WHEN MY TRUCK HITS A BUMP AND JUMPS OUT OF CONTROL AT 65 MPH OR HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  I'M A SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OFFICER AND I KNOW THIS TRUCK HAS A PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE SOME GETS KILLED.*JB",
