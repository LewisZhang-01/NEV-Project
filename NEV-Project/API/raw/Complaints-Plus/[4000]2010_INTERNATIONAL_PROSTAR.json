WE HAD SEVERAL DRIVERS COMPLAIN OF THIS ISSUE, UPON INSPECTION  YOU CAN NOT FIND ANY VISIBLE CRACKS IN THE EXHAUST.  SEVERAL DRIVERS WERE HAVING TO PUT THE WINDOWS DOWN IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE FUMES INSIDE THE CABIN WHILE DRIVING. AFTER SENDING TO THE DEALER, THEY ADVISED THAT THE PIPE WAS CRACKED INTERNALLY BEHIND THE SHEATHING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THEY ADVISED ON THE PROCEDURE TO CHECK FOR THIS SYMPTOM, YOU HAVE TO USE THE ENGINE SOFTWARE AND FORCE A REGEN SESSION. ONCE YOU DO THAT , YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE FUEL SMOKE AND SMELL RAW FUEL.  THIS IS THEN DRAWN UP THRU THE HVAC DUCT AND PUTS IT INSIDE THE CABIN.  THE REPAIR IS A 500.00 PIPE PLUS LABOR  FOR A TOTAL OF 800.00.
