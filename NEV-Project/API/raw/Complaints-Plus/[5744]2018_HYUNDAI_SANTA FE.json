We purchased this car in April of this year and the car has lived more at the dealer service department than with us. The first time, the car started smoking and left us stranded. The dealer changed out the fuel injectors. When it randomly started smoking it smelled strongly of gas and we were scared that the car would catch fire. The other times were due to the car not accelerating as it should on the highway making it quite difficult to merge and speed up as needed on the highway. This time, it's the same thing. The car does not want to shift gears and it's very dangerous when you are trying to accelerate to get to the right speed and you have cars coming in close from behind and there is no way to signal to them that the car is having trouble shifting. This problem started again yesterday. The check engine light turned on yesterday as well and we took the car to Autozone to scan it. the only code that came up was abs. The car just got towed to the dealer yet again but I have lost hope that they will be able to fix the issue as they have failed 3 times already.

THEY REPLACE THE FUEL NOZZLE AFTER 3 DAYS I GOT THE VEHICLE BACK AND HEADED TO MCKINNEY TEXAS, I MADE IT TO WICHITA FALLS TEXAS AND THE CAR SPUTTERED AND DIED AGAIN THIS TIME NOT EVEN TURNING OVER WHEN YOU PUSHED THE BUTTON. ONCE AGAIN I CALLED BLUE LINK AND THEY TOWED THE VEHICLE INTO HYUNDAI TO BE SERVICED. THEY CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT AND ADVISE ME. THEY NEVER CALLED ME BACK SO I HAD TO CALL THEM. THEY SAID THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BLEW OFF. THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE IT IN  THE MORNING. THAT NERVE HAPPENED AND THEY HAVE NOT CALLED ME BACK SINCE AND THAT WAS 6 DAYS AGO. THIS VEHICLE POURING FUEL INTO A CYLINDER IS A FIRE HAZARD. THIS TIME IT BUILT UP ENOUGH COMBUSTION TO BLOW THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER COMPLETELY OFF. I DO NOT KNOW THE REASON FOR THIS AS OF YET AS THEY ARE NON RESPONSIVE BUT I HAVE FILED A LEMON LAW CASE AGAINST HYUNDAI AND AM AWAITING THEIR DECISION. THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE AND I REFUSE TO GET BACK ONTO IT AGAIN. IT HAS STRANDING MYSELF AND MY FAMILY DOG INCLUDED TWICE NOW ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD..
