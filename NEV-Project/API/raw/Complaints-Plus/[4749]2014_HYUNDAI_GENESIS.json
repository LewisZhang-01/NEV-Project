I PRESSED EVEN HARDER ON THE BRAKES AND THE CAR CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD AS IF IT WAS SLIDING ON ICE; IT CREATED TIRE SKID MARKS FROM MY FRONT TIRES - SUPPORTING THAT THE BRAKES WERE ENGAGED.   I ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV FASTER. THE NOSE OF MY CAR WAS LOWERED DUE TO MY PRESSING ON THE BRAKES AND AS A RESULT THE FRONT END OF MY CAR WENT UNDER THE BUMPER OF THE TRUCK AND BEGAN LIFTING THE TRUCK UNTIL IT FINALLY CAME TO A STOP.  THE CONDITIONS WERE SUNNY AND THE ASPHALT WAS DRY.     ON FRIDAY JUNE 23 AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00PM ET I WAS BACKING DOWN MY DRIVEWAY, WHICH HAS A SLIGHT VERTICAL DECLINE, SO THE BRAKES WERE ENGAGED.  THE CAR'S ENGINE SUDDENLY REVVED AND ACCELERATED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE STREET; ONCE AGAIN, IT FELT AS IF I WAS SLIDING.  THE BRAKES WERE FULLY ENGAGED.  I WAS ABLE TO PLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL AND THE CAR CAME TO A STOP.  I PLACED THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTED WITHOUT ANY ISSUE.    REGARDING THE JUNE 23 INCIDENT, THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVEN FOR APPROXIMATELY 6-8 DAYS.  RELATING TO THE INCIDENT ON JULY 4; THE LAST TIME THE CAR WAS DRIVEN WAS ON JUNE 23.  FROM JUNE 23 THROUGH JULY 4 THE CAR WAS PARKED AT THE AIRPORT.  THE ONLY PARALLEL THAT I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THESE TWO INSTANCES IS THAT THE ENGINE REV AND ACCELERATION OCCURRED AFTER THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.    MY RESEARCH INDICATES THIS HAPPENED TO MANY OTHER DRIVERS; HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTURER CLAIMS THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH THE CAR AND THAT IT IS HUMAN ERROR; AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY.  I WILL TAKE A POLYGRAPH TO PROVE THIS WAS NOT HUMAN ERROR, RATHER A MECHANICAL FAILURE.",
