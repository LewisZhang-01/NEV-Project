VERY UNSAFE TO NEARLY CRASH WHEN BOTH BLOW AT THE SAME TIME DRIVING AT NIGHT. VERY UNSAFE DRIVING AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME A HEADLIGHT WILL BLOW OUT. NOT TO MENTION TELLING VARIOUS POLICE OVER AND OVER THE PROBLEM. NOT TO MENTION TICKETS, WARNINGS, AND GENERAL DISDAIN FROM POLICE BECAUSE THEY ASSUME YOUR LYING. I NOW HAVE TO KEEP NITRITE GLOVES AND SPARES IN MY GLOVE BOX AND NOW SHOW THE POLICE. I REPLACE A LOW BEAM BULB ON EITHER SIDE EVERY 3 TO 4 MONTHS. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS AS A SAFE AND ACCEPTABLE DESIGN ON ANY MOTOR VEHICLE. THIS WOULD NOT PASS AS SAFE ON ANYTHING. WE THE CUSTOMERS NEED THIS FIXED. HAD I KNOWN THIS IN 2008 I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE. AS OF NOW I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE IT. I HATE HAVING TO TRY MY BEST TO BE HOME BEFORE DARK BECAUSE A BULB IS OR WILL GO OUT. RECALL THIS DEFECT NOW.... BEFORE SOMEONE DIES FROM A CRASH. WHEN MY LIGHTS BLEW AT THE SAME TIME THAT NIGHT I WAS SCARED TO DEATH AND ALMOST WRECKED. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. PLEASE HELP.   *TR",
