I spoke with my mechanic who was having similar issues and told me about a group he is part of because there are so many people with this same issue. The screen is delaminating and causing what people are referring to as ghost touches. I think this is a safety hazard because it is distracting to have your screen changing constantly. It will make phone calls on it's own, change from heat to AC and turn the fan from high to low. Having your AC blasting in the middle of winter is no treat. Having your heat blasting summer won't be great either. This is a safety issue as well. This is all controlled by the screen. Imagine someone has epilepsy and this crazy screen causes a seizure? I have contacted Dodge and my local Dodge dealer. Nobody wants to acknowledge the issue because I am out of warranty. Warranty or not it's a safety issue that needs addressed before it causes someone to go off the road due to distractions of the radio doing whatever it wants and controlling all kinds of things in your vehicle. I know I am not the first person to reach out or report this issue. I really hope there is something that can be done before someone gets hurt. Thank you for your time and consideration.

As it spreads, the touch screen can intermittently press buttons on the screen by itself. It can select any setting/function on the screen and can even go through setting menus all by itself.  This issue has caused me to almost get into an accident several times. The first time it happened the Uconnect started going through settings while I was driving and caused me to swerve while trying to regain control of what it was doing. Another time it almost caused me to crash what when I was driving through a town in the rain while using the GPS on the Uconnect. When I was trying to find my turn the GPS started randomly going through settings and I swerved while I was trying to take control and figure out where I was supposed to turn. Additionally, the delamination effects the visibility of the back up camera.   I would be extremely surprised if this issue hasn\u2019t caused an accident. Groups on Facebook have users report this issue on almost a daily basis and Dodge is aware of the delamination issue. They have looked at mine and told me it\u2019s something they see all the time.",

        "summary": "The tail light and license plate lights on my 2018 Dodge Durango have shorted out. This issue is happening on models of earlier and later years of the Dodge Durango and there are many forums all over the internet discussing this issue. The light accumulates water in it and shorts out. I have not found any evidence of water in my lights as the thousands of other owners have but the same symptoms of this issue are happening to my Durango even though I keep it in the garage.  My lights just went out today and there are less than 45,000 miles on the vehicle. The lights are LEDs so they should last quite awhile. I know the lights are not burnt out because I replaced the license plate lights with new oem ones a few months ago and they are already out again.   The tail light on the Durnago is split into three sections, left, center, and right. The center part which is the largest, provides the most visibility for my vehicle while on the road is the section that commonly burns out for the Dodge Durangos as it has with mine. Owners are reporting this issue with less than 7,000 miles on the vehicles.  A short can cause a fire. My Durango is garage kept so if that vehicle sets fire, my house, myself, my wife, and my 3 children will all be burned alive. The fact that it is garage kept also makes this issue very ridiculous because it is hardly out in the weather. Especially since I work from home and my wife is a stay at home mother. We hardly go anywhere, especially if it is raining.   Another safety issue this may cause is if the tail light is blinking or suddenly begins to blink, drivers behind me may think I am slamming on my breaks and this could cause a pile up on the highway. Pile ups can kill numerous people on the road.   While the light is not shinning at all, other vehicles on the road lose visibility of my vehicle. This is especially the case in foggy weather or at night. If people cannot see me, they may hit me possible killing my family or their own.",
