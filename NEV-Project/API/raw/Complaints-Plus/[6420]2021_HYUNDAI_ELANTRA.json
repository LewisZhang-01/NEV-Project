The engine was revving and then slowing down opposite of what would be expected.  This is a hybrid vehicle - it felt as if the gas engine was supposed to be spooling up to charge the battery but instead was feeding power to the wheels. there was no engine light illumination from this.  I restarted the car and it seemed ok.  Honestly, this was scary - trying to move from one lane to the next to an exit to safely exit the morning rush hour freeway.  I had to keep my foot HEAVY on the break to make it slow / stop.  On two other previous drives the vehicle \"lurched\" / the car \"bucked\" once or twice and then the gas engine would not re-engage.  the MIL came on, and the car drove on battery power only.

Although the body indentations match, the hood looks as if it were from a completely different model. It also shifts down on the driver side of the vehicle giving concern that it may shift further and get damaged. A clear manufacturer defect and safety hazard. After the dealer told me they could do nothing, I opened a case with Hyundai Motor. Hyundai Motor has failed to reply or report back on a resolution. Initial report was made on 5/13/21 and a case # was assigned (case manager assigned on 6/5).  As of today, 6/9/21, Hyundai Motor has not yet contacted me for a resolution.  I am concerned about driving my vehicle if it causes the hood to shift even further and causes damages, detaches, bumps up against the front grill, or causes an accident.",
