A SALES TECH MET ME WITH A NEW RELAY THAT I PURCHASED. THE NEW RELAY DID NOT GET MY CAR MOVING AGAIN BECAUSE WHEN THE RELAY (THAT WAS IN MY CAR WHEN I BOUGHT IT) CAUGHT FIRE, IT CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE COMPUTER/ECM.

ON OCTOBER 21, 2014, I RETURNED TO DEALER AND THE CAR WAS IMMEDIATELY WAS DRIVEN INSIDE AND PLACED ON A LIFT TO BE INSPECTED. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT IT WOULD BE A LONGER WAIT THEN EXPECTED DUE TO MITSUBISHI'S HEAD OFFICE BEING LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, AND TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE. I WAS NOT GIVEN A LOANER CAR, STANDARD PRACTICE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE WITH FULL WARRANTY AND HE ( SVR. MANAGER) DID NOT GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION WHILE I WAITED. THE NEXT DAY, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM VIN FROM MITSUBISHI SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHO TOLD ME MITSUBISHI, WANTS TO GET AUTHORIZATION FROM ME TO BREAK DOWN THE CARS ENGINE/TRANSMISSION IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT WOULD COST ME $1100, IF THEY SAW THAT IT WASN'T A DEFECT ON MITSUBISHI'S PART. I GAVE THE AUTHORIZATION AND  WAS CALLED AGAIN BY VIN, WHO ADVISED ME THAT THE CAR HAD A DEFECTIVE SEAL AND THE CAR IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. ON OCTOBER 22, 2014, AT ABOUT APPROX. 4:25PM I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MITSUBISHI SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO GIVE ME A NEW UPDATE ON THE DEFECTIVE PARTS AND REPAIRS. VIN TOLD ME THAT THE CLUTCH & FLY WHEEL HAD BURNED OUT AND THAT MITSUBISHI WAS NO LONGER GOING TO COVER REPAIRS, WHICH HAD NOW REACHED $3,200. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE CAR  FROM MITSUBSHI; WE BOUGHT IT WITH 11 MILES ON IT AND IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT A BRAND NEW CAR CAN HAVE SUCH DEFECTIVE PROBLEMS. MITSUBISHI IS NOT UPHOLDING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND WE FEEL WE HAVE BEEN SOLD A LEMON. HOW CAN A VEHICLE GO IN FOR AN OIL LEAK AND SUDDENLY HAVE ALL THESE MAJOR ISSUES?  OCTOBER 27TH I WAS TOLD BY THE DISTRICT MANAGER OF MITSUBISHI THAT THE CAR WAS NOT GOING TO BE COVERED AND MITSUBISHI TOLD ME TO \"DO AS YOU PLEASE.\"  *TR",
