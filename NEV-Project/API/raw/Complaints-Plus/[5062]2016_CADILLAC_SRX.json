It's so bad, I am afraid to drive and night and now won't and will only allow my husband too.   This headlight issue has been an ongoing problem with Cadillac where they issued a recall, but for some reason didn't include the 2016 models in that recall.    A case advisor offered us $500 towards the $2,000 repair and stated if there ever is a recall they would refund us what we paid.  This is unacceptable.

I am handicapped and the power lift gate is very important to me because I have to store my walker in the car when I drive. Now since I can\u2019t open the back of the car it is very difficult to get anywhere for me.  When I looked up the issue, it seems Cadillac has a problem with this model (SRX) from 2010-2016. The issue develops because rain runs down the Sun roof straight into the place that the lift gate parts are in- and the parts corrode. Once the lift gate power system fails there is no way to manually open the back of the car. There is no manual release, and no place to insert a key.  This problem is well documented online with attempted class action suits that failed to \u201cgain traction\u201d per various attorneys. I have been told by the repair center that it will cost about $5000 to fix because of the difficulty of reaching the parts that need replacing. They say that the repair will take about 10 hours of service to replace the corroded pieces.  I am so disappointed in Cadillac. They knew of the design flaw since 2010 but did not address it until 2017. There is no reason that unsuspecting owners should get stuck with a $5000 repair due to a design flaw! I purchased this car 2 yrs ago, and only found it now because we get so little rain in California, and I have a garage. We had an abnormally large amount of rain in December and it failed right after the largest rainfall we have had in years.",

I have missed turns and even missed the road and drove off the roadway when making turns off the main road. I have not sustained damage and was lucky that there was no traffic following closely as I have, in several instances, had to stop abruptly to avoid damaging my vehicle. I also very narrowly missed seeing a person walking along the side of the road where no sidewalk was available because the dim lights did not fall on the person. I took the vehicle to Cadillac of Knoxville today, Jan.13, 2022, and was told that even brighter light bulbs will not help. They wanted to charge me $2280.00 plus tax to replace the headlight assembly that Cadillac is aware of the deterioration. This vehicle has only 57,701 miles on it, it is an upscale vehicle, yet I cannot safely drive it after dark. Cadillac needs to be held responsible for replacing the headlight assembly.

I get the impression that this problem may be greater than they want to acknowledge and they are hoping that I will just go away.  I will not, this is more about principal at this point than money.
