RECENT 60 MINUTES 2 PROGRAM, TO BE RE-AIRED ON 17 AUGUST, ADDRESSED DETAILS OF THIS AND RELATED INCIDENTS (OVER 70 LAWSUITS FILED AS A RESULT OF POST REAR-IMPACT FIRE RELATED INJURIES/DEATHS IN LATE MODEL FORD MUSTANGS).  FORMER HEAD OF NHTSA, MRS. JOAN CLAYBROOK, INTERVIEWED ON PROGRAM CONFIRMING THAT FMC WITH-HELD INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AND REQUESTED FOR THE NHTSA INVESTIGATION ON THE CRASHWORTHINESS OF THE EARLY MODEL FORD MUSTANG DROP IN FUEL TANK SYSTEMS.  OVER 2 MILLION MUSTANGS PRODUCED WITH THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER MODELS BY THE FMC.  THE GREAT POPULARITY OF THE EARLY PRODUCTION FORD MUSTANG MAKES THIS A CONTINUING AND GROWING PROBLEM IN REGARDS TO PASSENGER/HIGHWAY SAFETY.  THE CONDUCT OF THE FMC IN THEIR CONTINUEING REFUSAL TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THIS DESIGN CONSIDERING THAT THEY HAVE KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS, NOT TO MENTION THEIR WILLFULL AND WANTON DISREGARD OF BOTH THE LAW AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN THEIR WITH-HOLDING OF INFORMATION ON THEIR OWN CRASH TESTS AFTER HAVING BEEN ASKED FOR THIS INFORMATION BY NHTSA, IS EGGREGIOUS, NOT TO MENTION POSSIBLY CRIMINAL.  WHAT IS BEING DONE?  APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION VIEWERS SAW THE 60 MINUTES 2 PROGRAM.  WERE NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH NHTSA?",
