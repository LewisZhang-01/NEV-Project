I CALLED TOYOTA TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE FRAME RUST AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS NO WARRANTY TO COVER THIS. I SEARCHED ONLINE AND IT SAYS THAT 1995-2000 TOYOTA TACOMA'S WERE UNDER RECALL FOR FRAME RUST BECAUSE THE RUST WOULD MAKE THE VEHICLES UNSAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE VEHICLE WOULD BE COMPROMISED. SO I SEARCHED AROUND AND FOUND THAT MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY 15 YEARS, 4 MONTHS OLD AND THAT TOYOTA WOULD NOT COVER THE VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THAT RUST IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS/YEARS TO DEVELOP, IT IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH OCCURS OVERNIGHT. THE RUST LOOKS MAINLY TO BE SURFACE RUST ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT IN REALITY THE RUST HAS DEVELOPED FROM THE INSIDE-OUT AND ROTTED THE FRAME OUT, THEREFORE IT WAS NOT CAUGHT EARLIER. I HOPE THIS RECALL IS EXTENDED, THERE ARE MANY RUSTED TOYOTA TACOMAS LISTED FOR SALE FROM THE 1995-2000 MODEL YEAR, WHICH ALSO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.

IT WASN'T UNTIL THE ODOMETER WENT OUT DRIVING ON GRAVEL A WEEK LATER THAT I REALIZED THE ODOMETER WAS FLAWED. AND IT DOESN'T RECORD THE MILEAGE WHEN IT IS OUT. ON CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE HISTORY REPORT, THERE ARE SIX REPORTS UNDERNEATH THE ODOMETERCHECK SECTION. THE SUSPECT MILEAGE IS BETWEEN THE 2ND AND 3RD MILEAGE REPORTS. THE 2ND MILEAGE REPORTS 15,000 MILES 10/09/98 WITH A NOTATION STATING: \"NOT INCLUDED IN ROLLBACK CALCULATION.\" THE 3RD MILEAGE REPORTS 10,038 12/10/1998. THAT IS A DIFFERENCE OF -4,962 MILES LOST ON THE ODOMETER. I PHONED, THEN BROUGHT THE TACOMA BACK TO LITHIA 8/6/13. THE MAN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM AND RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE CIRCUIT BOARD AT MY EXPENSE. THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO, HE REPEATED. I WROTE A LETTER TO TOYOTA CORP. 8/9/13 AND RECEIVED A RESPONSE BY PHONE 8/20/13. THE ANALYST STOOD BY LITHIA'S DECISION 8/23/13.",

THE PROGRAM OFFERS TO BUY BACK TOYOTA TACOMAS THAT FAIL THEIR \"INSPECTION\"  DEALER ACTUALLY DENTED THE FRAME DURING INSPECTION DUE TO WEAK FRAME SECONDARY TO RUST.  THEY DID NOT PUT A HOLE IN IT THEREFORE RETURNING IT TO ME, SAYING THE VEHICLE IS SAFE.  CONTACTED CORPORATE TOYOTA AND BASICALLY GOT BLOWN OFF AS THEY STATED THE DEALER DID NOT PUT A HOLE IN IT DURING INSPECTION.  PERSONALLY, ANY VEHICLE WHICH YOU CAN DENT THE FRAME IN CRITICAL AREAS WITH A 12 OZ HAMMER WITH \"LIGHT TO MODERATE\" SWINGS IS UNSAFE.  AT THIS POINT I CAN ONLY HOPE I DO NOT GET INTO A CRASH WITH THIS VEHICLE.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT AS I BELIEVE THEY ARE OVERLOOKING A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THIS VEHICLE.  *TR",

TOYOTA IS BUYING BACK THE TRUCKS BECAUSE OF SAFETY PROBLEMS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS RESULTING FROM COLLAPSING FRAMES THAT HAVE RUSTED OUT.  THEY ARE DOING THIS TO AVOID A NHTSA RECALL.  MY TRUCK HAS A TITLE THAT LISTS PRIOR DAMAGE, AND THEY WILL NOT TAKE MY TRUCK BACK.  THEY CLAIM THAT THE TRUCK HAS BEEN ALTERED.  THE TRUCK WAS REPAIRED USING TOYOTA TACOMA FACTORY PARTS, AND NOT AFTERMARKET PARTS.  THE TRUCK WAS REPAIRED IN YEAR 2002, BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANY CHOSE NOT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON REPAIRS.  IF MY TRUCK WAS NEWER, THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE SPENT THE MONEY ON REPAIRS, THE REPAIR WOULD NOT APPEAR ON THE TITLE, AND TOYOTA WOULD QUALIFY THIS TRUCK FOR BUY BACK.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY TRUCK AND A NEWER TRUCK RECEIVING THE SAME REPAIR IS THAT ONE IS OLDER THAN THE OTHER, AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY CHOSE TO REPAIR THE NEWER VEHICLE.  MY 1998 TACOMA WAS PROFESSIONALLY REPAIRED AND INSPECTED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS POLICE.  THE TRUCK LOOKS BRAND NEW EXCEPT FOR THE FRAME RUST.

I BOUGHT IT NEW IN 1998 AND MAINTAINED IT REGULARLY. THE LAST TIME THAT I PUT IT ON A JACK THE FRAME PARTIALLY COLLAPSED WHERE IT WAS RESTING ON THE JACK. AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION I FOUND SEVERE CORROSION THROUGHOUT THE FRAME. THE BUMPER BRACKETS  WERE BARELY HOLDING UP THE BUMPER. IT HAD BEEN A RELIABLE TRUCK ,AND THIS WAS THE SECOND TACOMA THAT I HAVE OWNED. BOTH WERE EQUALLY RELIABLE. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM HAS GIVEN ME QUITE A SCARE. I DON'T DARE HAUL ANYTHING HEAVY IN THE BED ,AND THE IDEA OF TOWING SOMETHING WITH IT IS SIMPLY OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE BODY WAS STILL IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE WITH A LITTLE CORROSION ON THE FRONT OF THE HOOD FROM A STONE CHIP. I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROBLEM COULD HAVE BECOME SO SEVERE. I WOULD EXPECT A CERTAIN MOUNT OF RUST DOWN THERE, BUT THIS WAS MORE SEVERE THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.  MY BEST GUESS WAS THAT THE VEHICLEWAS ALMOST WORTHLESS EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING ELSE  WASIN SATISFACTORY CONDITION. UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS PROBLEM, I HAD EXPECTED TO KEEP IT FOR AT LEAST 5 MORE YEARS.*AK",
