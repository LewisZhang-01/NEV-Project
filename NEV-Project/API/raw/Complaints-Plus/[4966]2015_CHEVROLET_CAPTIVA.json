Also, the car will appear completely dead/unresponsive can cannot be started.  The key will get stuck in the ignition.  This is currently the situation.   These occurances can happen 3 to 5 times per week.    We cannot identify a particular set of circumstances that creates the situation.  It seems to happen randomly.   Other owners of the Chevy Captiva have reported having similar problems.    To fix the problem, I have separately had the Body Control Module replaced, replaced the battery and had a grounding wire replaced.  The problem remains unresolved.     Since this appears to be a common issue with the Chevy Captiva, I would like GM to investigate and propose a solution.  I am willing to pay for the solution, but we (owners, dealers and repair shops) need to know how to repair the vehicle.",
