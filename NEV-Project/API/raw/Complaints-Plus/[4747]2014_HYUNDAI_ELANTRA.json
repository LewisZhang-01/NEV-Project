        "summary": "I purchased this vehicle from Duncan Hyundai in Christiansburg VA on 11/13/2021. When I purchased the vehicle it had 90,588 miles on it. I started hearing a knocking sound coming from the engine in late January - early February 2022 only 2-3 months of having the car. The engine light came on and the car was also smoking some. We checked the oil in the vehicle and it was empty. We put a quart in the vehicle to take it to the dealership. We were told that yes, the vehicle in fact did not have any oil in it. I asked them well were did the oil go? Is there a leak or something? Oil just doesn't disappear like that. The mileage on the car at that time was 93,543. It wasn't even due for an oil change. I was told that this particular vehicle burns oil and every thousand miles & we will have to add a quart to it at that time. We are now monitoring that. I see that Hyundai has an open recall for this same knocking sound and burning oil on the 2019-2020 models. My 2014 is having the same problem and now I will have to take it back and forth to the dealership to make sure they monitor and hopefully eventually fix the problem for me. Again all they said at the moment was add a quart every thousand miles. In a month period (March) I have had to add 2.5 quarts to the vehicle. The vehicle now has a total of 94,916 miles on it. In a total of 1,373 miles it burned 2.5 quarts. What the dealership said about a quart every thousand miles was not correct. It has burned double that amount.",

Unsure what this was, we took it to the dealership where we bought it 2 years prior as it was due for its oil change. There was no check engine light when we discovered this problem. When the tech drained the oil, he claimed there was metal shavings in the oil (he saved them in a bottle for us) and this was due to the knocking engine (piston slap) we had described to the tech. The car had just hit the 80,000 mile mark so this was baffling to us. We had since parked it as we did not have the money to repair the engine. This is a HUGE safety issue. There's a lawsuit against Hyundai for the 1.8 NU Elantra Engines but not the 2.0? It's experiencing the same exact issue but Hyundai will NOT acknowledge their 2.0 NU engines. This is wildly dangerous to the public who got the green light to keep driving their 2.0 engines. We had it towed to Maryland from Washington State as we had moved. It's currently at 1706 Massey Blvd, Hagerstown, MD 21740. It has been there since December of 2019. The engine had been replaced but the dealership wants over $3,000 in repairs. They will not release the car to us until we pay it. The only warning was the noise itself. No lamps, lights or any indication of any fault.",

First noticed an issue with extremely jerky driving, but added gas and the problem went away, and I thought it was a one time thing. About a week later, it happened again. Then, a few days later, the car shut off as I was driving through a parking lot. I set up an appointment with the dealership for a week later. In that week, the car died while driving through town twice, and also as I was driving into work once. It is the smoothest shutoff I have ever experienced, only the engine dies, and it starts right up once I stop and put it in park. I don't even notice the engine turn off until I try to press the gas.\"  \"The car died 4 times, the engine completely shut off. It would throttle by itself at lights or in the drive thru.I could not drive up until no one was in front of me because the car would hesitate then jerk forward. Almost got hit from behind making a right turn because the car would not accelerate with oncoming traffic approaching from behind.\" \"Were on a very busy street and the car just died. Very hot outside, people backed up behind us. Could start the car, but when lift off the break, it would die again. Police helped us push it off the busy road into a parking lot.

SO AS IT STANDS NOW, I HAVE NO CAR AND OWE 8K ON A LOAN.  HYUNDAI WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALLED ENGINE THAT WAS SO CALLED REPAIRED, I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, THEY STATE. MY WARRANTY COMPANY SAYS ONLY PAYING FOR VALUE OF CAR AND THEN YOUR WARRANTY WITH US IS VOID.  THE AMOUNT THEY ALLOW IS ONLY FOR A USED ENGINE, WHY WOULD I BUY ANOTHER USED ENGINE WITH THE SAME ISSUES WITH NO WARRANTY COVERAGE, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THE SHOP LOOKED FOR A MONTH AND TO NO AVAIL WAS THERE A USED MOTOR IN THE USA...HUMMMM, I WONDER WHY? SO TO BUY A NEW ONE, YOU GO OVERSEAS AND THAT WOULD COST ME 3K MORE ON TOP OF THE WARRENTY PAY OUT AND 6 WEEKS OUT LEAD TIME. I CANT BELIEVE WITH ALL THE ISSUES PEOPLE HAVE AND THE MORE AND MORE RECALLS THEY ARE DOING FOR ENGINES AND FIRERS THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THESE CARS AS WELL. I AM NOW OUT 8K ON MY LOAN AND NO CAR. I WILL NEVER EVER PURCHASE OR HAVE A GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT HYUNDAI OR KIA...EVER !!! THIS IS COST ME SO MY TIME AND MONEY AND AGGRAVATION I FEEL LIKE GOING TO MY LOCAL NEWS WITH MY STRORY, THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG!",

THERE ARE NOW JUST OVER 110,000 MILES ON THE CAR. I RECENTLY WAS DRIVING ON A SECONDARY ROAD A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME. THE CAR MADE A SCREECHING SOUND, ALMOST STALLED, AND THEN THERE WAS AN ENGINE TICKING NOISE. NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON. I HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL MECHANIC THAT I TRUST. I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD NEED  NEW ENGINE BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS LOOSE METAL IN THE ENGINE. I HAVE ALSO READ THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE IN HYUNDAI 2.0L ENGINES. THIS CAR HAS MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES ON IT. IT HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND HAS ALWAYS HAD THE OIL CHANGED BEFORE THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED MILEAGE. I THINK THIS ENGINE SHOULD STILL BE COVERED AS IF IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NOT ENOUGH OF THE ELANTRA GT (I THINK MOST PEOPLE BUY THE COUPE WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT ENGINE) HAVE BEEN SOLD TO CREATE A RECALL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED HAVE BEEN TRADED IN. OVER THE PAST 3 TO 4 YEARS, I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS LETTERS AND CARDS FROM HYUNDAI. THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY NEEDED ME TO TRADE IN MY ELANTRA GT AND THEY WOULD OFFER ME TOP DOLLAR ON A TRADE IN OR TRADE UP. I NOW THINK THEY WANTED MY CAR BACK BECAUSE THEY KNEW THIS ENGINE HAD PROBLEMS AND HOPED THEY COULD JUST SELL ME A DIFFERENT CAR. I JUST PAID THIS CAR OFF AND INTENDED TO DRIVE IT SEVERAL MORE YEARS. THIS IS A FAULTY ENGINE. NO CAR THAT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED SHOULD HAVE THIS HAPPEN. I STILL HAVE A JEEP I BOUGHT IN 1994 WITH OVER 200K MILES AND IT RUNS GREAT!

I PULLED OVER AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED. I CONTACTED THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP. THE HYUNDAI CONTACT STATED THAT IT WAS NOT NORMAL THAT A THREE YEAR OLD HYUNDAI AUTOMOBILE ENGINE SHOULD DIE. THE HYUNDAI CONTACT STATED THAT MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP SHOULD PERFORM A PA. PA IS A PRIOR APPROVAL. THE PA WAS PERFORMED AND ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS DIRECTOR OF SERVICE KEVIN ANDERSON SUPPORT, AND AGREEMENT OF ABNORMALITY, THE PA WAS SUBMITTED. THE PA CAME BACK AS DENIED STATING 'EXCESSIVE MILEAGE'.  THE DIRECTOR OF SERVICE DISAGREED AND RESUBMITTED THE PA. THE CASE WAS ELEVATED TO A HYUNDAI CORPORATE CASE MANAGER BY THE NAME CAMERON. CAMERON REJECTED THE PA AS WELL BUT CHANGED THE REASONING TO 'MILEAGE OVER WARRANTY'. THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE PA IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I AT THIS POINT ON AUGUST 31, 2018 OVERNIGHTED A LETTER TO THE CEO OF HYUNDAI MR. KYUNG SOO LEE. TO DATE I HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION. IN SPEAKING WITH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DIRECTOR I WAS INFORMED THAT AT HIS DEALERSHIP ALONE THERE ARE 5/6 HYUNDAI ELANTRAS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR ENGINES. HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THE HYUNDAI SONATA HAS AN OPEN RECALL ON THE ENGINE. HE STATED THAT THE ENGINES FOR BOTH THE SONATA AND ELANTRA VEHICLES ARE CURRENTLY BACK ORDERED FOR A TERM OF AT LEAST 1 TO 2 YEARS. IN MY PERSONAL ONLINE RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND COMPLAINTS OF THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES HAPPENING TO THE ELANTRA ENGINES: HIGHWAY DRIVING, NO WARNING INDICATORS, RATTLING NOISES, VEHICLE STOPPING, AND ENGINE DEAD.   I AM ENCLOSING THE CEO LETTER ALONG WITH THE PA DOCUMENTATION.",

AT 4300 MILES I LOST ALL CONTROL OF THE STEERING AND THE CAR WENT ACROSS 3 LANES OF INTERSTATE 3 TIMES BEFORE I REGAINED CONTROL OF THE CAR. I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND HAD TO \"TRADE IT IN\" TO GET A DIFFERENT CAR. I LEFT THE DEALER WITH A 2014 ELANTRA LIMITED ON 7/21/14 HAVING TO PAY THEM AN $4500 EXTRA. THE 2014 FELT BETTER ON THE ROAD NOW AT 1300 MILES I START FELLING THE SAME FISH TAILING FEEL WHEN THE CAR IS GOING INTERSTATE SPEED 70MPH. AS I WRITE THIS THE CAR NOW HAS 1944 MILES AND THE CONDITION IS GETTING WORSE. I DRIVE THE SAME INTERSTATE EVERYDAY AND THE ROAD CONDITIONS HAVE NOT CHANGED. I NO LONGER CAN DRIVE THIS CAR INTERSTATE SPEED, I NOW HAVE TO DRIVE IT AT NO MORE THAN 55MPH. THE 2013 DID THIS FISH TAIL OR WANDER ALSO, AND JUST BEFORE IT WENT OUT OF CONTROL IT DID IT SHARPLY FOR NO REASON. NOW I HAVE CONCERN THIS WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS CAR ALSO AS THE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE STARTING ARE THE SAME. I CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE AND FILED A COMPLAINT, THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. THE WOBBLE AND UNSTABLE FEEL DRIVING THIS CAR, IS A VERY ON EDGE UNPLEASANT RIDE AS ONE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT WILL LOSE CONTROL. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS THE STEERING OR THE STABILITY CONTROL OR EVEN THE SUSPENSION THAT IS THE ISSUE. YOU CAN'T FEEL THE WOBBLE IN THE STEERING WHEEL, YOU FEEL IT THOUGH OUT THE CAR. I HAVE NOW HAD TWO ELANTRA'S DRIVEN THEM A COMBINED MILEAGE OF 7000 MILES IN 8 WEEKS AND BOTH HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG WITH THE CONTROL OF THESE CARS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL, I CAN'T BE THAT UNLUCKY TO GET THE ONLY TWO CARS OUT THERE WITH THE SAME ISSUE.    *TR",
