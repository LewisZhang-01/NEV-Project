I PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET TO HAVE WHATEVER NEEDED FIXED IN MY BRAKING SYSTEM FIXED BY THEM IN OCTOBER 2015.  APPROXIMATELY LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS LATER, I WAS ON THE FREEWAY (AND OF COURSE PEOPLE DRIVE FAST AND THERE WERE CARS ALL AROUND ME), I HIT A DIP IN THE ROAD AND MY BRAKES ALMOST WENT OUT.  IT SCARED ME SO BAD!  I HAD TO PULL OVER THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PUMP MY BRAKES AGAIN TO GET THE PRESSURE BACK UP.  I HAVE OWN OTHER VEHICLES FOR YEARS AND NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE UNTIL I OWNED THIS PARTICULAR TYPE VEHICLE.

I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP IN FEBRUARY 2016 AND THEY STATED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BRAKE SYSTEM AND REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT.
