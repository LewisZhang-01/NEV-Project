THIS HAPPENED MANY TIMES, LUCKILY WITH ANY ACCIDENTS. WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO VOLVO NUMEROUS TIMES FOR SERVICE, BUT THEY COULD NEVER FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, OTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS OUR KEY RING WAS TOO HEAVY. WE NEVER RESOLVED THE ISSUE. AS I READ ABOUT THE GM ISSUES IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPERIENCED WITH OUR CAR. JUST THOUGHT SOMEBODY MIGHT WANT TO KNOW.  *TR",
