THE PROPANE HOT WATER HEATER EXHAUST MELTED THE PLASTIC LANYARD FOR THE CAP ON THE FRESH WATER FILL PORT DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. IF I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT, THE WATER HOSE THAT SUPPLIES THE WATER TO THE CAMPER WOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY OVER THE EXHAUST AND POSSIBLY MELTED CAUSING A COMPLETE FAILURE OF A PRESSURIZED WATER HOSE. THE FRESH WATER PORTS ARE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE HOT WATER HEATER AND THE EXHAUST WILL QUITE EASILY MELT ANY OF THE PLASTIC.",
