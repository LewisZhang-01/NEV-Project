HE SAID HE ALSO CALLED GMC HQ TO FIND OUT IF THE CHARGE COULD BE WAIVED AND WAS TOLD NO.  THEY TOLD ME THAT IF I WAS INVOLVED IN A CRASH, THE AIRBAG MIGHT NOT DEPLOY.  I DID NOT GET IT REPAIR AT THAT TIME.  I WROTE TO GMC HQ ABOUT THE PROBLEM SAYING IT WAS A SAFETY DEFECT AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE AZ DEALER, THEY SAID NO TO MY WAIVER.
