FIRST OCCURANCE OF VEHICLE STALLING AND SHUTTING OFF OCCURED IN 2015 WITH 80K MILES; WHEN THE THROTTLE BODY LIGHT/ ESP BEGAN FLASHING AND SPUTTERED A FEW SECONDS BEFORE IT SHUT OFF WHILE IN MOTION. THE VEHICLE RESTARTED WITH IN 10 MINUTES. I HAD THE THROTTLE BODY AND GASKET REPAIRED. SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN OTHER RANDOM OCCASIONS OF STALLING WHERE THE THROTTLE LIGHT/ ESP AND ENGINE LIGHT FLASHES PRECEDDING A STALL. NOW 2018-19 (107K MILES) I WENT IN FOR DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE MY CAR STALLED AGIN THIS TIME WAS IN BUSY TRAFFIC AND THROTTLE LIGHT, ESP LIGHTS, ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON BEFORE THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THERE IS A CRANKSHAFT ISSUE THAT CAUSES THE ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON AND STALL THE VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY. I HAD CRANKSHAFT REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS CHANGED, THE THROTTLE BODY CLEANED AND THE ELECTICAL HARNESSES SERVICED TO YET HAVE THE SAME ISSUE OCCUR WHEN THE VEHICLE STALLED 24 HRS AFTER REPAIRS. THE ENGINE, THROTTLEBODY AND ESP LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN WITH IN 24 HOURS BEFORE SHUTTING OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION OF TRAFFIC. I AM NOW HAVING A 3RD INDEPENDENT MECHANIC LOOK INTO THE ISSUE AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE CAUSING THE INTERMITTENT STALLING. I SPOKE WITH JEEP CUSTOMER CARE AND THEY STATED THAT MY PARTICULAR VIN DOESN'T HAVE A RECALL ALTHOUGH OTHER PATRIOTS OF THE SAME CLASS HAVE HAD SAME OCCURENCE AND RECALL YET THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO FOR ME IN THIS CASE TO ADDRESS THE SAFETY ISSUE OR REPAIRS SINCE I AM OUT OF WARRANTY. I STRONGLY RECCOMMEND THAT THE DOT INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND REQUIRE JEEP TO EITHER RECALL THE VEHICLE OR REQUIRE JEEP TO REPAIR THESE VEHICLES TO SAFE PERFORMANCE ON THE ROADS AND/OR REFUND ME THE PURCHASE PRICE AS I AM STILL IN CONTRACT PAYING FOR A NON FUNCTIONAL RISKY VEHICLE.  *JS",

COMING HOME SAME NIGHT DECIDED TO TAKE ON INTERSTATE TO SEE HOW IT WOULD DO AT 65-70 MPH AND HOLY MOLY THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VIBRATING LIKE ONE OF THE MASSAGE CHAIRS IN THE MALL.  COME TO FIND OUT ON FORUMS THAT JEEP OWNERS ARE AWARE OF THE GAS ISSUE (DEALER DOESN'T KNOW OR NEGLECTED TO TELL US) AS WE ARE FIRST TIME JEEP OWNERS.  THE VIBRATING STEERING WHEEL --- WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE A KNOWN ISSUE TOO, BUT OUR VIN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ON THE RECALL LIST EVEN THOUGH I LIVE IN PA AND FALL INTO THE COVERED YEARS.  I AM BRINGING CAR BACK TO DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED FROM TO HAVE THEM CORRECT THE ISSUES.  WE HAVE A 30DAY 1000 MILE WARRANTY.  LETS SEE HOW MUCH OF A FUSS I HAVE TO MAKE OVER THIS.    FILLING GAS TANK AND STALLING OUT ON HIGHWAY I'D SAY THAT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  VIBRATING STEERING WHEEL COULD FALL UNDER THE X69 EXTENDED WARRANTY---WILL KNOW MORE ON MONDAY.",

WITH NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AS A WARNING, MY DAUGHTER PUT GAS IN APPROXIMATELY A MONTH AGO AND AFTER AN HOUR DRIVING, IT STALLED ON A BUSY STREET TRAVELING AT 55 MPH, WHICH INTERRUPTED THE STEERING AS IT DECELERATED ON A HIGHWAY. AFTER TOWING TO A LOCAL FIRESTONE AUTO CENTER WE WERE INFORMED THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY DIAGNOSTIC CODES FIRING OFF TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. SINCE THEN MY HUSBAND GASSED UP THE PATRIOT AND IT STALLED AT A BUSY INTERSECTION JUST PULLING OUT OF THE STATION. HE MANAGED TO DRIVE ON BACK ROADS AVOIDING TRAFFIC WHERE IT HAD REPEATEDLY STALLED. HE THEN RAN THE PATRIOT FOR AN HOUR IN MY DRIVEWAY WHERE IT STALLED ANOTHER 10 TIMES IN AN HOUR. HE CONTINUED TO RUN THE PATRIOT ANOTHER HOUR TILL THE STALLING STOPPED. I AM NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING GAS AGAIN, HOWEVER I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCEDURE TO PREVENT A FAMILY MEMBER FROM GETTING INVOLVED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT.",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A JEEP DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE IN THESE EARLY GEN. PATRIOTS, AND THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED BY JEEP (CHRYSLER ACTION # 23-012-1) FOR THE 2007 PATRIOT AND COMPASS MODELS.  THE DETAILS OF THE RECALL WOULD BE THAT JEEP WOULD COVER THE COST TO REPAIR THE ROTTED SUB FRAMES IN THE 2007 PATRIOTS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JULY 2007, AND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR COVERAGE UNDER THIS RECALL IS DECIDED BY VIN NUMBER.  THE DEALER CONFIRMED THAT MY JEEP WAS MANUFACTURED AFTER JULY 2007, BUT PURCHASED IN MARCH 2008 AND THUS WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE SAME RECALL.    NOW, I AM CURRENTLY HAVING ISSUES WITH MY PATRIOT'S STEERING AND DECELERATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.  I EXPERIENCE SHAKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND VIBRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE WHILE GOING SPEEDS OVER 50MPH ON THE HIGHWAY.  WHEN EXITING THE HIGHWAY ON A RAMP, THE ISSUES ARE THE MOST PRONOUNCED.  I HAVE TO BE DILIGENT ABOUT BRAKING SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKE SURE THE CAR IS DECELERATING SAFELY AS WELL AS THE STEERING FEELING EXTREMELY LOOSE.      I'VE CONTACTED JEEP TO SEE IF THE ISSUE WITH THE SUB FRAME ROTTING WOULD BE COVERED IN THE 2008 PATRIOT MODEL, SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME ISSUE AS THE 2007S HAD AND HAD NOT BEEN CORRECTED.  I HAD NO LUCK TALKING TO A REPRESENTATIVE WITH JEEP ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  MY TICKET WITH JEEP WAS CLOSED BY CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER THE E-MAIL REP. DIRECTED ME TO PURCHASE A WARRANTY WITH JEEP OR VISIT A DEALER (WHICH I'D ALREADY DONE).     WE ARE BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC TO FIX THE SUB FRAME THIS WEEK.  I'D LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED BY JEEP FOR THE COST OF REPAIRING THE SUBFRAME.

IT HAS ALSO SHUT OFF MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE IDLING WHEN I HAVEN'T FILLED THE TANK. THE DEALERSHIP HAS REPLACED THE PURGE VALVE SOLENOID AND ALTERNATOR AT MY COST THINKING THAT WOULD FIX MY PROBLEM BUT NOTHING HAS WORKED. THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED I REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AT MY COST, BUT AFTER ALREADY POURING OVER $1000 INTO THE VEHICLE, I WAS HESITANT TO SPEND $1500 MORE. I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING THE PROBLEM BY ONLY PUTTING ABOUT 10 GALLONS OF FUEL MAXIMUM IN MY TANK. TWO WEEKS AGO THE VEHICLE MADE A LOUD BANGING NOISE AND LIGHTS STARTED FLASHING ON THE DASH AND THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T GO OVER 20 MPH. LUCKILY I WAS ONLY ABOUT A MILE FROM ANOTHER JEEP DEALERSHIP. THIS TIME THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR WAS BAD. ANOTHER $800 FIX. I TOLD THIS DEALERSHIP OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS I WAS EXPERIENCING WITH THE CAR SHUTTING OFF AND THEY THOUGHT THIS MAY FIX MY PROBLEM. THEN ABOUT 5 DAYS LATER, UPON TRYING TO REFUEL MY VEHICLE, I WAS UNABLE TO PUT MORE THAN 1 GALLON OF GAS IN THE TANK. THE PUMP KEPT SHUTTING OFF AND GAS STARTED POURING BACK OUT OF THE TANK. I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ONLINE ONLY TO FIND THERE ARE A LOT OF JEEP OWNERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. OTHER JEEP OWNERS HAVE TRIED TO REPLACING THE EVAP CANISTER, ONLY TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUE AGAIN SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. THEN THEY END UP HAVING TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUEL TANK.

I HAD BOUGHT THE VEHICLE USED ABOUT 6 MONTHS EARLIER IN THE FALL.    AS I WAS DRIVING THE ENGINE BEGAN TO MAKE A \"WHINING OUT\" NOISE AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TO LOSE POWER.  A LIGHT CAME ON THE DASH AREA AND MY SPEED SUDDENLY DROPPED DOWN TO ABOUT 40 MPH AND I WAS LOSING POWER TO KEEP UP WITH TRAFFIC. A TRACTOR TRAILER THAT WAS TRAVELING BEHIND ME HAD TO SLAM ON HIS BRAKES AND ALMOST LOST CONTROL FROM TRYING TO AVOID RUNNING INTO THE BACK OF THE CAR.    I PULLED OFF THE INTERSTATE AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK.  AFTER WAITING A COUPLE OF HOURS AND LETTING THE ENGINE COOL DOWN, I STARTED THE CAR BACK UP WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER HAD ARRIVED.  HE TOLD ME THAT THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING AND CAUSES THE ENGINE TO LOSE POWER UNTIL IT COOLS.    I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP AND PAID $100.00 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHICH DID NOT REVEAL ANY OTHER PROBLEM OTHER THAN WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THE LIGHT THAT CAME ON IN \"NORMAL\" AND IS EXPLAINED IN THE OPERATING MANUAL.  THEY EXPLAINED THAT IT IS \"NORMAL\" FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND THERE WASNT ANY DEFECT OR ANYWAY TO FIX IT.

NOW I'M READING THAT MANY OTHER JEEP PATRIOT OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS. I HIGHLY SUGGEST A RECALL FOR THE 2008 JEEP PATRIOT.  IT HAS A CVT TRANSMISSION, WHICH IS A DANGEROUS TRANSMISSION BECAUSE IF IT OVERHEATS THE VEHICLE SHUTS DOWN. MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE VEHICLE SHUT DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY, LUCKILY NEITHER HE NOT ANY OTHER MOTORIST WAS HURT. IN 2014 JEEP CHANGED FROM THE CVT TRANSMISSION ENTIRELY, SUGGESTING THEIR AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE WITH THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION.

ON NOVEMBER 29, 2013, I DROVE THE CAR FROM STAMFORD, CT TO BRIDGEPORT, CT. I WAS DRIVING AT A SPEED OF 50 MPH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CAR STARTED MAKING A NOISE AS IF SOMETHING WAS CLOGGED IN THE FUEL SYSTEM. THE CAR WOULD NOT DRIVE OVER A SPEED OVER 15 MPH.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, I HAD THE CAR CHECKED AND THERE IS A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION IN THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM. HE STATED THAT ONLY A JEEP DEALER WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST ME. THE SECOND INCIDENT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 14, 2014 AND THE CAR DID THE SAME EXACT ISSUE WITH THE NOISE (CLOGGED) AND THE CAR BEGAN TO JERK. AT THE TIME, I WAS IN NEW ROCHELLE, NY AND I DROVE STRAIGHT TO ADVANCE AUTO LOCATED ON MAIN STREET. THE TECHNICIAN ASSISTED ME AND HOOKED THE CAR UP TO THE SCANNER AND IT GAVE ME A CODE OF P2017. I PURCHASED SOME FUEL INJECTION CLEANER TO SEE IF THAT COULD HELP ME OUT. I DROVE APPROXIMATELY 4-5 MILES AND THE CAR DIED. I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO SEE IF I CAN GET THE CAR TOWED TO STAMFORD, CT. I WAS TOLD BY THE TECHNICIAN AND MECHANIC THAT JEEP PATRIOT HAVE A RECALL ON THE FUEL/PROPULSION SYSTEM. I'VE ALSO HAD SUSPENSION ISSUES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. IT BEGAN IN JULY OF 2013. THE CAR HAS POOR STEERING AND I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY GET WHEEL ALIGNMENTS AND CHANGE THE FRONT TIRES. I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THE JEEP PATRIOT HAVE A TON OF SAFETY RECALLS ON THE 2008 MODEL. I HAVE A SCHEDULED TOW TO HAVE THE CAR SERVICED AT THE JEEP DEALER. I WOULD LIKE THE RECALL ISSUE TO BE HONORED. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED NOTIFICATION ON ANY RECALLS BY THE MANUFACTURE. THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. I DO WANT TO INCUR ANY INJURIES OR FATALITIES. I AM PAYING A CAR NOTE ON THIS VEHICLE AND I FEEL AS I'VE BEEN ROBBED!   *TR",

I CALLED AAA AND HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO BAXTER JEEP CHRYSLER, WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2009.  .  I TOLD THEM THAT THE CLUTCH HAD SHOWN NO SLIPPAGE OR OTHER SIGNS OF IMPENDING FAILURE.  THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 47,000.    ON MONDAY, THEY FOUND THAT THE RELEASE BEARING/SLAVE CYLINDER HAD FAILED AND THAT FLUID HAD LEAKED FROM THE SLAVE CYLINDER INTO THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, WHICH COULD NOT BE CLEANED EFFECTIVELY.   THEY STATED THAT THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY ITSELF HAD TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH THE SLAVE CYLINDER.THE COST OF THE REPAIR WAS $1338.56.   IN THAT MODEL YEAR,  I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THE POWER TRAIN. THE CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMED THAT THE SLAVE CYLINDER WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED PART OF THE CLUTCH.  I DISAGREE.  ALTHOUGH THE SLAVE CYLINDER SUBSERVES THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY,  IT IS PART OF THE POWER HYDRAULIC SYSTEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.    1) CHRYSLER IS NOT HONORING THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY.  2) THERE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY DESIGN ISSUE WHEN THE HYDRAULIC COMPONENT CAN LEAK DIRECTLY INTO THE CLUTCH, IMMEDIATELY DESTROYING ITS FUNCTION.  THE FAILURE OF THE CLUTCH WAS SUDDEN AND UNPREDICTABLE.    THERE ARE SEVERAL POSTS ON INTERNET RAISING IDENTICAL ISSUES ABOUT THE JEEP DESIGN AND FAILURE TO HONOR THE SERVICE GUARANTEE.

THE DEALER INDICATED THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE FOR ANY EXTENDED MILES. THERE WAS AT LEAST 1/2\" PLAY IN THE WHEELS.   THE PARTS HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED.  PREVIOUS INSPECTION & TIRE ROTATION AT ABOUT 25,000 MILES AND 2 1/2 MONTHS AGO INDICATED NO SUSPENSION PROBLEMS.  THE ONLY CLUE TO THE PROBLEM WAS SOME 'CLUNKING' NOISE IN THE FRONT END WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS.    THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW, HAS BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY BY THE SELLING DEALER, IS DRIVEN EXCLUSIVELY ON THE ROAD, AND HAS BEEN IN NO ACCIDENTS. UP UNTIL MAY 2011, IT WAS DRIVEN ONLY ABOUT 7,500 MILES ANNUALLY.  IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY FOR ONLY 40-DAYS.

THE VALVE STEMS USED TO BE MADE OUT OF BRASS OR STEEL. AND IN THE COLORADO WEATHER WITH THE SEVERE COLD I THINK IT IS CRACKING THE ALUMINUM STEMS.

THE JEEP STARTED TO MAKE LOUDER CRANKING SOUNDS AND GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO STEER. I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE THE SOUND. I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE OR COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE JEEP IN THIS CONDITION.  UPON TAKING THE JEEP TO BOB BOYD, A CERTIFIED JEEP DEALER IN LANCASTER, OHIO, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE AXLE NUT RETAINER WAS RUSTED AWAY. THE RUST WAS CLEANED FROM THE AXLE AND THE NUT, PER THE SERVICE REPORT, AND THE AXLE NUT WAS RETORQUED. THE CHARGE OF THIS \"REPAIR\" WAS $157.47, WITH NO OTHER REPAIRS BEING MADE. I WAS TOLD THAT IF I HAD NOT BROUGHT THE JEEP IN AT THE TIME I DID, THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE AXLE NUT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE TIE RODS AND WHEELS TO COME APART FROM MY VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING.  AT THAT POINT, THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE GONE. MY HUSBAND ASKED IF THIS COULD CAUSE ANY OTHER TYPES OF PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE WITH MY STEERING AND WHEEL ASSEMBLY AND HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM.  IN AUGUST OF 2010, I WAS RECOMMENDED TO HAVE MY TIE RODS REPLACED, AS THERE WAS A NOISE COMING FROM MY TIRES AGAIN. UPON HAVING MY CAR TAKEN TO BOB BOYD AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT MY LOWER CONTROL ARM AND BALL JOINT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. WITH AN ALIGNMENT, THE TOTAL COST WAS $694.60 FOR THIS VISIT.  I UNDERSTAND THAT TIE RODS ARE A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM, HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THE RUSTED AXLE ROD IS A SAFETY ISSUE ON A VEHICLE THAT WAS JUST OVER A YEAR OLD AT THE TIME IT WAS FOUND.   PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM, AS A RUSTED OUT PART THAT COULD CAUSE A VEHICLE TO \"COME APART WHILE DRIVING\" SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY ISSUE.  THANK YOU. *TR",
