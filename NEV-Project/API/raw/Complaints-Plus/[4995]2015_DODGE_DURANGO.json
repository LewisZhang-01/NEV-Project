ON 4/15/2020 THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE BATTERY WAS DEFECTIVE AND CHARGED ME TO REPLACE IT, BUT THE ISSUE IS STILL NOT RESOLVED.     ON 5/1/2020 THE TRUNK RANDOMLY OPENED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS OFF AND IN MY DRIVEWAY, IT WAS RAINING. ON 5/27/2020, WHILE DRIVING IN A STORM, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER SAID \"SERVICE ELECTRONIC BRAKES, BRAKE FLUID LOW\" AND THE PARKING BRAKE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON AND OFF. THE ERRORS NEVER SHOWED UP AGAIN AFTER THE VEHICLE DRIED OFF. ON 6/26/2020, A DAY AFTER A THUNDERSTORM, THE ENGINE WOULDN'T TURN OVER EVEN THOUGH THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER CAME ON. THE IGNITION WAS STUCK IN \"RUN\", AND THE P/R/N/D LIGHTS WERE ALL ON, AND THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER SAID \"SERVICE TRANSMISSION CONTINUE IN D DO NOT SHIFT OR TURN ENGINE OFF\"; BUT THE ENGINE WAS OFF. I HAD TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY TO TURN THE VEHICLE ELECTRONICS OFF.     *** EVERY SINGLE TIME THE VEHICLE HAS DIED WHILE DRIVING OR FAILED TO START WHILE PARKED, I HAVE GOTTEN A U0100 ENGINE CODE    SAN ANTONIO DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP HAS FAILED TO DIAGNOSE OR FIX THE ISSUE, AND DODGE CORPORATE HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE ANY RESOLUTION EXCEPT TO TELL ME TO TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP.

I LEFT THE CAR TO GO GET MY KEY FOB AND LEFT THE DOOR OPEN; BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY BACK DOOR, MY DAUGHTER WAS SCREAMING (SHE WAS IN HER CAR SEAT) AND THE CAR WAS MOVING BACKWARD DOWN THE DRIVEWAY, SCRAPING AGAINST THE HOUSE, INTO THE STREET AND ACROSS THE ROAD TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE UP THEIR DRIVEWAY. I RAN AFTER THE VEHICLE AND RIGHT BEFORE IT STRUCK MY NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE, WAS ABLE TO THROW MY FOOT INTO THE BRAKE FROM THE SIDE WHILE I FELL ON THE GROUND. I WAS BRUISED AND MY CAR WAS DAMAGED, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY MY DAUGHTER WAS FINE BUT SCARED. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM TAKE A LOOK AT THE DOOR/MIRROR AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ISSUE (THIS IS REFERENCED IN THE \"ACTION PLAN\" FOR THE VISIT), AND THE GENTLEMAN AT THE MIKE SMITH BEAUMONT DEALERSHIP STATED THAT MY VEHICLE MUST HAVE HAD A QUIRK, BECAUSE THERE WAS ALREADY AN UPDATE AVAILABLE ON THAT WHICH THEY WOULD TEST. WHEN I CAME BACK TO GET MY VEHICLE, I ASKED ABOUT THE UPDATE, AND HE STATED THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN; THAT ONLY PICKUP TRUCKS WERE GETTING THAT UPDATE. I ASKED WHY, BECAUSE THERE'S NO LESS SAFETY RISK IN A DURANGO (IN FACT, PROBABLY MORE CHILDREN). HE DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER BUT SAID HE WOULD GET BACK TO ME. NO ONE DID, AND I COMPLAINED TO DODGE ONLINE. EVENTUALLY IN AUGUST 2018 I GOT AN ODDLY PHRASED NOTICE THAT DID NOT USE THE WORD RECALL BUT STATED THAT \"REPAIRS\" NEEDED TO BE MADE. I WROTE TO DODGE AGAIN AND ASKED IF THEY WOULD ASSIST WITH THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS TO MY DOOR/WINDOW BUT THEY WOULD NOT.  I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT DODGE DID NOT INCLUDE DURANGOS IN THIS OBVIOUSLY EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND DISAPPOINTED THAT IT TOOK A YEAR TO TAKE ANY ACTION (WHICH DOES NOT HELP MY REPAIRS).

I DISCOVERED MY 2015 DURANGO HAD ROLLED BACKWARD APPROXIMATELY 35 FEET COMING TO REST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT I HAD SOMEHOW FAILED TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN \"PARK\". HOWEVER, AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE, I COULD SEE THE ROTARY DIAL CONTROLLING THE TRANSMISSION WAS CLEARLY INDICATED TO BE IN THE \"P\" POSITION. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE VEHICLE WAS NOT RUNNING AND THE PARKING BRAKE WAS NOT ENGAGED.    OBVIOUSLY, HAVING THE VEHICLE ROLL AWAY WAS NO SMALL CONCERN. SO I CONTACTED THE DEALER WHO SOLD ME THE VEHICLE AND WAS ADVISED TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER IN MY COMMUNITY FOR INSPECTION. ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP THIS WAS THE SECOND RECENT COMPLAINT HE HAD RECEIVED ON THIS SAME ISSUE. ULTIMATELY, THE DEALER INSPECTION TURNED UP NO DISCERNABLE CAUSE.     I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONTACTED BY THE SM STATING THAT CHRYSLER WAS FLYING A COUPLE OF GUYS UP TO TAKE A LOOK AT BOTH VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE ROLL-AWAY COMPLAINT. THIS PROCESS ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN MY RECEIPT OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WORKING \"SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS\" FOR FCA STATING, IN ESSENCE, THAT MY DURANGO IS \"FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED\".     A FEW FINAL THOUGHTS: (1) THE SLOPE OF OUR DRIVEWAY IS STANDARD FOR HOMES BUILT ON FLATLAND. AN EYEBALL MEASUREMENT HAS THE RISE AT ABOUT 20\" OVER A RUN OF 36'. (2) OUR DURANGO REPLACED A 2004 LINCOLN AVIATOR. THE AVIATOR UTILIZED THE SAME POSITION IN OUR DRIVEWAY FOR SEVERAL YEARS (SANS ENGAGEMENT OF THE PB), YET WE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH IT ROLLING AWAY. MAYBE THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO DUMB-LUCK. OR, MAYBE IT WAS DESIGNED NOT TO. (3) FORTUNATELY, WE LIVE ON A QUIET STREET. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN REAL BAD.",
