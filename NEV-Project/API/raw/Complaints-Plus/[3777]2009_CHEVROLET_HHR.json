I went directly to the nearest Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a traumatic amputation of the right hand (dominant) fifth finger with complete loss of the nail. Three hand x-rays show open, partially displaced fracture of the distal phalange. Due to severe mutilation of the fingertip it could not be reattached to the remaining portion of my finger.

THE DEALERSHIP COULD GET NO DIAGNOSTIC CODE OF THIS AND HAS TOLD ME THERE IS NO OPEN RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THE MOTOR REPLACEMENT. I AM VERY DISTURBED THAT THIS PROBLEM 1. GENERATES NO CODE, 2. IS BEING UNACKNOWLEDGED BY GM, AND 3. SEEMS TO BE AN ON-GOING THREAT TO SAFETY FOR MANY HHR DRIVERS. GM HAS MADE A MISTAKE IN NOT INCLUDING MY MAKE/MODEL (OR SO IT SEEMS) IN THE BULLETIN PERTAINING TO REPLACING THE EPS MOTOR FOR LIFE AND IS FAILING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL VEHICLES ON THE ROAD NEEDING TO BE SERVICED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DRIVER STATES THERE IS A PROBLEM POSING A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.

THEY WERE RUDE AND SAID THE CAR IS OLD AND PAST WARRANTY. WELL I HAVE HAD MANY VEHICLES AND NONE OF THEM EVER LEAKED GAS. WHEN I ASKED THE REP, DO YOU KNOW WHAT GAS DOES?  HE IGNORED THE QUESTION AND STARTED TO READ FORM HIS SCRIPT. SPOKE TO THE SUPERVISOR  SAME THING UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO REASON AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER. ALMOST THE SAME DEAL UNDERSTANDING BUT AGAIN UNWILLING TO HELP WITH FIXING. AFTER A BATTLE. WE GAVE IN AND HAD THE DEALER FIX IT. CONVENIENTLY  THE TECH CUT THE GAS LINE WHERE IT WAS LEAKING.  THE BILL CAME TO $795.  GM NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUES. THIS IS LIFE THREATENING.  GM NEEDS TO RECALL THESE CARS AND MAKE IT RIGHT.THERE HAVE  BEEN RECALLS ON AIR BAGS, WELL WHAT GOOD ARE THE AIR BAGS IF THE CAR BLOWS UP.",

PAID $315.00 TO BE REPAIRED AND PICKED IT UP TODAY AND THE FLASHING LIGHT IS STILL ON.  MY CONCERN IS THIS MAY ALSO BE A FACTORY DEFECT ALSO THAT HAS NOT BEEN DETECTED.  I AM FEELING A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE AIRBAG BEING REPAIRED AND STILL DOING THE SAME THING. I AM A SENIOR AND I TRAVEL ALWAYS WITH A 33 YEAR OLD TOTALLY DISABLED CHILD. IF MY AIRBAG IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY , YOU WOULD HAVE TWO PEOPLE IMPACTED BY THIS.  NOW I WAS TOLD TO BRING IT BACK BUT AS ISAID I AM NOT FEELING TO GOOD ABOUT THE JOB REALLY BEING DONE. AS A CONSUMER WHAT CAN I DO OTHER THEN HAVE THIS ON FILE WITH YOUR OFF?  *TR",

I COULD NOT TURN THE KEY AND I COULD NOT GET THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION SWITCH SO THE VEHICLE JUST CONTINUED RUNNING. I DROVE HOME AND REMOVED THE MAIN FUSE WHICH RESULTED IN THE VEHICLE SHUTTING DOWN.I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A CHEVROLET DEALER WHERE THE SWITCH AND KEY WERE REPLACED AT AN EXPENSE OF ALMOST THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PRIOR TO THAT PROBLEM AND EVEN NOW SINCE THE REPAIRS WERE MADE I HAVE TO MANIPULATE THE KEY TO START THE VEHICLE.   I CERTAINLY HOPE GM WILL HONOR THIS SITUATION AS I HAD PREVIOUS NIGHTMARISH  EXPERIENCE WITH THEM WHEN I OWNED A 1999 MALIBU (REMEMBER THE DEXCOOL CRISIS) AND AFTER SPENDING A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY(OVER $2,000) IN ENGINE/INTAKE/WATER PUMP.THERMOSTAT REPAIRS THE CLASS ACTION RESULTED IN MY GETTING A CHECK FOR $21.00(THAT'S TWENTY ONE). IF THIS SITUATION IS RESOLVED I WOULD SIMPLY LOOK FORWARD TO BEING REIMBURSED FOR THE $291.00 I JUST SPENT AND HAVING THE IGNITION SYSTEM CHECKED THOROUGHLY FOR DEFECTS AND/OR POTENTIAL DANGER.

CANADA HAS FORCED GM TO DO A RECALL ON THE HHR FOR THIS SAME EXACT ISSUE BUT TO DATE IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THE US.  THE DEFECTIVE STEERING MOTOR PART NUMBER RECALLED ON THE COBALT WAS THE SAME EXACT PART NUMBER AS THE HHR, SO WHY HAS THIS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED ON THE HHR?  IF YOU'LL READ SOME OF THE HHR FORUMS YOU'LL LEARN THAT MINE WAS NOT AS ISOLATED OCCURRENCE, IT IS VERY COMMON AND SEEMS TO START HAPPENING WHEN THE CARS GET AROUND 50,000 MILES.

I HAD THIS REPAIRED AT AN ASTRONOMICAL COST OF OVER $800.  MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT SURPRISE SURPRISE GM SAID THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE CHASSIS WARRANTY?  WHAT, THE STEERING IS NOT A COMPONENT OF THE CHASSIS?  THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, IM SURPRISED SOMEONE'S LIFE HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN LOST OVER THIS ISSUE.

THIS WAS A SCARY EXPERIENCE LATER TODAY AS IM DRIVING ON FREEWAY AT 65 OR SO POWER STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN. MY QUESTION IS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. WITH MORE RESEARCH I AM SEEING THIS IS COMMON FOR THESE CARS AND RECALLS ON OTHER CHEVROLETS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR SAME REASON. THIS IS SCARY ESPECIALLY IN NORTHEAST OHIO SNOW WEATHER AND ICY ROADS. I'VE BEEN TOLD CANT PINPOINT THIS UNTIL I TAKE IT IN TO THE SHOP WHEN THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT. SO I GUESS I WAIT TIL IT HAPPENS AGAIN REALLY??? IF I WORK FAR FROM DEALERSHIP GUESS IM SUPPOSED TO DRIVE IT TO DEALERSHIP WHEN IT GOES OUT AT 9 PM WHAT A JOKE. HOPE THEY FIGURE OUT THIS GLITCH....HAVE TO SHARE I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN A WHILE AGO WHEN HAD LESS MILES AND THOUGHT IT WAS A FLUKE NOW IT RETURNS.

ONCE FUSE WAS OUT THE CAR IS SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH THE KEY IN IT WHICH IS CAUSING A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF STRESS FOR ME. I HAVE TO PUT FUSE BACK IN THIS MORNING AND TAKE TO DEALERSHIP TO GET MY CAR FIXED. FROM OTHER COMPLAINTS THE FIX SHOULD BE THE SAME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE WHY THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS.
