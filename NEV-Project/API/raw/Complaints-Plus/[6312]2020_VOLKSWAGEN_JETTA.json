        "summary": "MY CAR ROLLED INTO A WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A PARKING LOT WHILE I WAS INSIDE THE OPPOSITE BUILDING. THERE IS NO ALERT/INDICATOR/NOTIFICATION THAT THE E-BRAKE IS ENGAGED. THERE ARE ALERTS FOR THE SEAT BELT, AIR BAG, TRUCK/DOOR OPENED, LOW GAS, LIGHTS, ETC. THERE IS EVEN A NOTIFICATION ON THE SCREEN TO REMIND ME TO GRAB MY PHONE AFTER I TURN OFF THE CAR AND OPEN THE DOOR. BUT FOR THE E-BRAKE, WHICH IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS THAT REQUIRES DISCRETE PAUSES BY THE DRIVER, THERE IS NOTHING.THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW, THAT COULD RESULT IN A CAR ROLLING AND INJURING SOMEONE. I URGE YOU NOT TO WAIT FOR CRITICAL MOMENTS AS IN THE PAST FOR AUTO ALERTS TO BE INSTALLED IN CARS, BUT TO ACT NOW. I REQUEST ALL AUTO MANUFACTURES, VW AND OTHERWISE, THAT HAVE E-BRAKES, CREATE AN ALERT THAT NOTIFIES THE DRIVER THE CAR IS OFF AND THE E-BRAKE IS NOT ENGAGED, RECALL THOSE CARS, AND UPDATE THE COMPUTER.  AND IF  THERE ISN'T ROOM, I SUGGEST DELETING THE NOTIFICATION TO NOT FORGET ONE'S PHONE.  *TR",
