AS I WAS DRIVING IT BACK TO NJ FROM LONG ISLAND DEALERSHIP I NOTICED A TRANSMISSION 'KICK/JERK/SURGE' AS CAR DECELERATED SEVERAL TIMES. DROVE THE CAR TO THE MARKET ON SUNDAY (7/25/2010) AND ON THE WAY BACK WARNING ENGINE MALFUNCTION STATING 'ENGINE OPERATING AT REDUCED OUTPUT'.     EMAILED THE BMW SA IN LONG ISLAND THAT REPLACED DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION PAN/AT FLUID AND HE FELT IT MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO OIL LEAK AND BAD VACUUM PUMP/SEALS AND HAVE IT LOOKED AT ASAP.     MY LOCAL BMW SA IN NJ JUST EMAILED ME TODAY (7/28/2010) STATING:    \"LOOKS LIKE THE TRANS IS BAD WAITING FOR BMWNA TO GET BACK TO US WE SENT THEM ALL THE FAULTS SORRY FOR THE BAD NEWS\"     REPORTS OF THESE TYPE OF TRANSMISSION 'SURGE' IS NOT ISOLATED TO 2004 545I MODEL BUT TO MANY 5-SERIES UP TO 2008 AS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING FORUM:  HTTP://WWW.BIMMERFEST.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=401524    THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOT ON A LOCAL DEALERSHIP BUT ON A CORPORATE, WITH GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT, LEVEL AS IT POSES SERIOUS RISKS TO ALL DRIVERS. *TR",

I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE, WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN BELOW (IN SECTION 2 AS REQUESTED), ONLINE, AND FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.  I FOUND THAT IN SOME INSTANCES, BMW CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE, HOWEVER IN MANY INSTANCES, THEY DID NOT (IN SECTION 3, AS REQUESTED).      2.  \"THE CAR WOULD SHIFT INTO 5TH GEAR & THEN BETWEEN 35-40MPH AT A VERY LOW 1200RPM OR SO I WOULD GET THE SURGING OR SLIPPING OF THE TRANSMISSION. IT WAS A VERY LIGHT REPETITIVE HESITATION. IT ALMOST FELT LIKE THE ELECTRONICS WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER IT SHOULD STAY IN 5TH OR SHIFT BACK TO 4TH BECAUSE OF LOW RPM'S. IT WOULD HAPPEN WITH AN EXTREMELY LIGHT ACCELERATOR PRESSURE. IF YOU GAVE IT A LITTLE MORE GAS IT WOULD GO AWAY. A COUPLE TIMES I'D GET A REALLY HARSH SURGE ALMOST LIKE THE \"SLAM\".  THE MANNER THAT THE CAR BEHAVES CAN REALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WITH THE SURGE IN THE TRANSMISSION, & THE DISTRACTION THAT IT CAUSES TO THE DRIVER.  IT HAS BECOME A DISTRACTION TO ME, BEING THE DRIVER, & ALSO NOTICED BY PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE, WHEN THEY FEEL THE CAR SURGE, & THEIR IS ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.      3.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A BMW DEALERSHIP, & DESCRIBED THE ISSUE. THE SERVICE ADVISOR (REPRESENTATIVE) STATED THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE VEHICLE, AS THEY HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS, AS WELL. HE SAID THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO DO A SOFTWARE UPGRADE, OR REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. I RECEIVED THE CAR BACK, & WAS TOLD THAT THE SOFTWARE WAS UPGRADED, & TO TAKE THE VEHICLE AND SEE HOW IT DROVE. I DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME, & THE ISSUE WAS STILL THERE. THE REPAIR INVOICE SAYS THE SOFTWARE WAS NOT UPDATED. IT ALREADY HAD THE LATEST VERSION. I TOOK THE CAR BACK, AND THEY STATED THE OPERATION OF THE CAR IS NORMAL. IT IS NOT NORMAL. YOU MAY REFERENCE HTTP://WWW.BIMMERFEST.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=401524 FOR OTHER WHO HAVE HAD THE ISSUE. THE MECHATRONICS UNIT WAS REPLACED ON SOME, AND ALWAYS RESOLVED THE ISSUE.  *TR",

I CONTACTED THE DEALER AS THE PREVIOUS REPAIRS WERE ONLY COMPLETED 9 MONTHS AND 4K MILES AGO, VEHICLE HAS 62K ON IT NOW. DEALER STATES FRONT CRASH SENSORS ARE BAG AND THE BILL WILL BE $700. THE REPAIRS REQUIRED THE REMOVAL OF THE BUMPER, REMOVE AND REPLACE AIR BAG SENSORS, AND PROGRAMMING. UNDER THE RECALL NHTSA STATES BMW WILL EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR 10YRS UNLIMITED MILEAGE, THINK AGAIN BECAUSE I HAD TO PAY THIS BILL OUT OF POCKET. THE EXTENDED RECALL ONLY COVERS THE SEAT MAT I'M TOLD. I CONTACTED BMW CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO WAS NO HELP AT ALL WITH THIS PROBLEM.

I HAVE LOST BOTH MY PATIENCE AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR X5 AND FEEL THAT THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN (2 1/2 AND 16 MONTHS) IS AT RISK AS THIS IS THE PRIMARY VEHICLE THEY ARE TRANSPORTED IN. ALL OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR AT THE TIME THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS EXPERIENCE A HEAD JERKING WHICH IN ITSELF IS UNSAFE. IN REVIEWING THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF POSTINGS REGARDING THE 2004 X5 4.4 TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT BMW IS FULLY AWARE OF AND HAS FAILED TO FIX. OUR X5 HAS A TRANSMISSION THAT IS \"SLIPPING\" AND IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN REAR-ENDED EACH TIME IT SLIPS. THE X5 HAS BEEN IN TWICE FOR THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS AT STERLING BMW AND IT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. STERLING HAS REPROGRAMMED THE DME AND REBUILT IT WITH NO SUCCESS. IT IS GOING IN FOR A THIRD TIME TODAY FOR THIS SAME ISSUE AND I EXPECT BMW OF NORTH AMERICA TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IMMEDIATELY. ACCORDING TO EVERYTHING I HAVE READ, THE X5 NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IF THIS ISSUE IS NOT RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY, WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND WE WILL EXERCISE OUR RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA LEMON LAW. I WILL ALSO BE NOTIFYING THE NHTSA TODAY AND FILING A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH THEM OVER THIS ISSUE AS THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. STERLING BMW HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO DEAL WITH AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE, BUT BMW OF NORTH AMERICA NEEDS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TOOLS TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.
