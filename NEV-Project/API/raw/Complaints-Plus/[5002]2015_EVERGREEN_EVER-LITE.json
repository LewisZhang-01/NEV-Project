        "summary": "THE STABILIZER JACK IS ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN AND CONTROLLED BY A SWITCH IN THE CARGO COMPARTMENT. THIS CIRCUIT IS NOT FUSED. WE HAD LOAD SHIFT WHILE IN MOTION WHICH JAMMED THE SWITCH INTO THE RETRACT POSITION. THE MOTOR OVERHEATED AND FAILED. THE SWITCH COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY BEEN JAMMED IN THE EXTEND POSITION, WHICH WOULD HAVE LOWERED THE JACK TO THE ROADWAY WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THIS LIKELY WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, AND CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. I REPORTED THIS TWICE TO EVERGREEN BUT THEY DO NOT THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT DESERVES THEIR ATTENTION. THE ENTIRE PROBLEM COULD BE ELIMINATED BY INSTALLING A $3 PROTECTIVE COVER OVER THE EXTEND/RETRACT SWITCH.",
