I TOOK THE CAR IN TO LET THEM TEST TO SEE IF THAT WAS WHY MY SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND IT WAS. THEY ORDERED THE PART AND I TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIR. PARTS AND LABOR WERE TO BE COVERED. THE DEALERSHIP CALLS ME TO INFORM ME THAT MY BOLTS WERE SEVERLY RUSTED AND I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOLTS IF THEY BROKE. THEY HAD TO REMOVE THE BOLTS REGARDLESS IF THEY WERE RUSTED OR NOT AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE LABOR THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE COVERED. THE BOLTS COST ME A TOTAL OF 4.92 AND THE LABOR WAS 164.00, THAT IS SOOOO FUNNY THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR LABOR THAT HAD TO BE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO REPLACE THE PART. I WAS TOLD THE THE RUST WAS DUE TO MY FAULT. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I KEEP THE BOTTOM SIDE OF MY CAR FROM RUSTING CONSIDERING IT IS 7 YEARS OLD. I MEAN THE BOLTS ARE ON THE EXHAUST WHICH GETS HOT AND COLD AND MAKES ITS OWN CONDENSATION AND MAKES ITS OWN RUST. SO IF THERE IS GONNA BE A SPECIAL POLICY FOR A DEFECT ON A CHEVROLET PART, WHICH IS THERE FAULT, YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME BETTER GUIDELINES ON WHAT IS COVERED. I HAD TO PAY FOR LABOR THAT HAD TO BE PERFORMED REGARDLESS IF MY BOLTS BROKE OR NOT. I CAN UNDERSTAND PAYING FOR THE BROKEN BOLTS, BUT FOR LABOR THAT HAD TO BE PERFORMED ANYWAY? AND GENERAL MOTORS WAS NO HELP AT ALL TO ME. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY SEND OUT A LETTER TO FIX A PROBLEM ON A CAR SO OLD IF THE LABOR IS NOT GONNA BE COVERED. AND WATCH OUT BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIPS LIE, JUST TO GET A BUCK. THEY TOLD GENERAL MOTORS THAT THEY HAD TO DRILL THE BOLTS TO GET THEM OUT. WELL THAT IS SO FUNNY BECAUSE THEY SAVED THE BOLTS TO SHOW ME AND I HAVE THEM IN MY POSSESSION AND GUESS WHAT, THEY AREN'T DRILLED. HOW FUNNY. SO WHEN YOU SEND OUT THESE \"SPECIAL POLICIES\" PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THE LABOR IS COVERED SO NOONE ELSE HAS TO ENDURE THE CRAP THAT I HAVE WITH CHEVROLET.  *NM",
