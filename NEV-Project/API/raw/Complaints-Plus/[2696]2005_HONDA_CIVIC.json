I researched technical service bulletins and find updates to vehicle software to resolve the air bag indicator staying on even when reset. I called Honda again and they said air bags covered until 2022 but I would have to pay a dealer to evaluate the system. I repaired the cable reel at my cost and my labor and I think Honda since air bag related should cover the repair of the cable reel and update the vehicle firmware and if needed replace the air bag under the 20 year safety related federal law.

MECHANIC FAILED TO REFILL THE RADIATOR RESERVOIR, BUT MECHANIC AND HONDA DEALERSHIP REPORT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED A HEAD GASKET FAILURE.      A SIMILAR PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN THE CAR HAD 88,000 MILES ON IT, AND A MECHANIC IN SILICON VALLEY FAILED TO REHOOK UP THE RADIATOR RESERVOIR WHILE WORKING ON THE SRS.  AFTER DRIVING 699 MILES TO PORTLAND, OR, THE CAR OVERHEATED ON A CITY STREET, WAS IMMEDIATELY STOPPED, AND TOWED TO A GARAGE.  THE GARAGE FOUND RADIATOR FLUID TO BE LOW IN THE RADIATOR, REFILLED IT, LET IT IDLE FOR TWO HOURS, AND THE CAR WAS THEN DRIVEN TO SEATTLE, AND IMMEDIATELY TO THE BAY AREA AFTER THAT.  WHILE CROSSING THE CALIFORNIA BORDER IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SNOW, THE HEAD GASKET COMPLETELY FAILED, AND THE CAR WAS NO LONGER DRIVEABLE.

NOT ONLY DOES THE CHOKE NEEDLESSLY COME ON, BUT IT COMES ON AT AN RPM THAT IS TOO HIGH.  IT NEEDLESSLY BURNS FUEL, BUT ALSO PRESENTS A SAFETY PROBLEM AND CAUSES YOU TO LOOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR.  HONDA IS REFUSING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE SOLUTION IS THAT THE CHOKE NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED IN THREE WAYS:    1) MANUALLY CHOKE SHUT OFF (WITH HANDLE, ACCELERATOR PEDAL, OR BUTTON),  2) 5TH GEAR DOESN'T DROP RPM SUFFICIENTLY AND CAR DOESN'T GET GOOD GAS MILEAGE,  3) VTECH ENGINE NEEDS TO BE MADE INTO A VTECH-E, SO THAT THE ENGINE GETS BETTER FUEL ECONOMY AT THE SLOWER SPEEDS AND MEET BOTH THE PUBLIC'S AND FEDERAL MILEAGE EXPECTATIONS.    HONDA OFFERS VTECH-E, BUT THEY ONLY PROVIDE THIS ENGINE SERIES TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO BUY THE DOUBLE OVERHEAD CAM, SUCH AS THAT FOUND IN THE CIVIC SI OR IN SOME ACCORDS.      THE SEATS IN THE 2005 HONDA CIVIC EX ARE DANGEROUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND POORLY DESIGNED.  HONDA GIVES YOU NOTHING MORE THAN A BLOCK OF RUBBER TO SIT ON, WHICH CAUSES SKIN IRRITATION DUE TO A LACK OF HEAT DISSIPATION WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF DRIVING.  IN ADDITION, THE FRONT SEATS ARE TOO FAR FORWARD AND SOMEONE OVER 5'9\" IS GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE CAR -- PARTICULARLY WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  THE LACK OF SPRINGS IN THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS POTENTIALLY CAUSES SPINAL INJURIES, DUE TO ROAD SHOCKS NOT BEING ABSORBED, FOR PEOPLE THAT DRIVE THE VEHICLE ON A DAILY BASIS.    A CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY SHOP ADVISES ME THEY CAN'T UNBOLT THE SEATS BECAUSE THE AIRBAGS WILL GO OFF BECAUSE THE AIRBAGS HAVE DISTANCE SENSING.  NOT ONLY IS THIS LUDICROUS, BUT OFFERS NO CONSUMER SAFETY.  A QUICK REVIEW OF THE 2001 HONDA CIVIC EX WITH THE 2005 HONDA CIVIC EX SE REVEALS THAT THE 2001 IS SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER TO OPERATE THAN THE 2005 CIVIC .

        "summary": "LAST AUGUST 2009, I EXPERIENCED BRAKE FAILURE 3 TIMES WHILE DRIVING MY 2005 HONDA CIVIC.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS NO BRAKING.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO HONDA DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM AND THEY ADJUSTED THE BRAKES AND DOCUMENTED IT WAS REPAIRED.  THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN TWO DAYS LATER AND THIS TIME, THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  THE ADVISED ME IN WRITING TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND TO BRING IT BACK.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND I HASSLED WITH THEM AND THE NATIONAL AMERICAN HONDA CORPORATION CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GOT NO SATISFACTION, NO REPAIR.  IN THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTATION THEY TRIED TO CLAIM THAT MY BRAKE SHOES WERE WORN OUT, BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE AS THEY HAD BEEN INSTALLED JUST ONE MONTH BEFORE AND SUBSEQUENTLY WHEN INDEPENDENT MECHANICS LOOKED AT THEM, THEY TOLD ME THE BRAKE SHOES AND ROTORS WERE FINE.  INDEPENDENT MECHANICS ADVISED ME TO GET THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER CHANGED.  FOR 3 MONTHS I DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR, I DOCUMENTED THE PROBLEM IN DETAIL AND TRIED TO PERSUADE HONDA TO FIX IT.  THEIR FLAT OUT REFUSAL BY DENYING THERE WAS A PROBLEM (I HAD THE CAR TOWED 3 TIMES TO THE DEALER AFTER EACH EPISODE OF BRAKE FAILURE) WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.  FINALLY, IN OCTOBER 2009, I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO ANOTHER GARAGE AND THEY REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER.  THE BRAKES HAVE NOT FAILED SINCE, BUT WHILE STOPPED AT A LIGHT THE OTHER DAY, IT SEEMED THAT THE PEDAL WAS ONCE AGAIN SLOWLY CREEPING TOWARD THE FLOOR.  THIS IS HOW THE PROBLEM HAD STARTED SO I'M WONDERING IF IT TRULY HAS BEEN FIXED.  I HAVE MUCH DOCUMENTATION OF THE ABOVE EVENTS.  THE NEWS OF THE RECALL THAT JUST OCCURRED WITH HONDA VEHICLES HAVING \"SOFT BRAKES\" MATCHED EXACTLY THE DESCRIPTION OF MY PROBLEM WITH SUBSEQUENT BRAKE FAILURE, SO THAT GRABBED MY ATTENTION.  I DID NOT KNOW YOUR WEBSITE EXISTED UNTIL I READ THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT THAT RECALL AND SO I AM VERY INTERESTED IN REPORTING MY PROBLEM.  THANKS SO MUCH! *TR",

THE ENGINE RACED AT ITS HIGHEST SPEED.  I WAS ABLE TO GET IT INTO PARK AND TURNED OFF, BEFORE IT CAUGHT FIRE. IT WOULD NOT RETURN TO NORMAL IDLE SPEED, EVEN AFTER I RESTARTED THE ENGINE A COUPLE OF TIME.   WE ENDED UP LEAVING THE CAR ON THE ROAD AND IT WAS EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO TOWN. THE SHOP WAS NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE SITUATION, BUT I AM WORRIED AFTER READING ABOUT THE TOYOTA PROBLEMS WHICH SOUND SIMILAR.  THE SHOP HAS REPLACED THE ACCELERATOR CABLE AND FLOOR MATS, THINKING IT MIGHT BE A SIMILAR SITUATION.  NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO DRIVE THE CAR OUT OF TOWN INTO THE MOUNTAINS.  I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THE PROBLEM SUDDENLY OCCURRED AND COULD HAVE CAUSED A FATAL ACCIDENT JUST A FEW MILES FURTHER ON THIS ROAD.  I CURRENTLY OWN AND DRIVE A 2005 PRIUS, SO I AM FAMILIAR WITH DRIVING A HYBRID CAR. THE HONDA IS A GOVERNMENT CAR DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF DRIVERS EACH DAY.  I AM NOT SURE OF THE YEAR, BUT I CAN CHECK THAT OUT. *TR",

SO, I GET THROUGH AND GOING ABOUT 15 MPH A SQUEAK THEN A KIND OF POP AND NEXT THING I KNOW IM PULLED INTO THE CURB, HOP IT, AND TAKE OUT A BUSH. I WAS SO MAD! MY CAR HAS 4600 MILES ON IT! SO I BACK IT OFF THE CURB AND PULL IT OVER. THERE WAS BAD CURB DAMAGE ON THE WHEEL AND MY WHEEL IS VERY. LOOKED LIKE VERY POSITIVE CAMBER. NOT TO MENTION THE NICE SCRATCHES AND GREEN MARKS THE BUSH GAVE TO MY BUMPER. UGH!!! I LOVE MY BRAND NEW CAR SO MUCH! I WASH IT TWICE A WEEK AND WAX ONCE EVERY 2-3 WEEKS. ALWAYS CHECKING FLUIDS, ALWAYS TAKING GOOD CARE OF IT. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND....WELL I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, FIGURING THIS WOULD ALL BE TAKEN CARE OF CONSIDERING THIS VEHICLE IS UNDER WARRANT AND NOT EVEN DUE FOR THE FIRST OIL CHANGE YET. WELL, I GET THE CALL BACK FROM THEM TELLING ME THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE PARTS TO BREAK OR COME LOOSE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS FROM ME HITTING THE CURB AFTER OR NOT. TO ME, SINCE THEY DIDN'T KNOW, THIS SHOULD BE REPLACED. MY CONCERN ON TOP OF THE $1,500 THIS IS COSTING ME OUT OF POCKET TO FIX, IS WHAT IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY??? GOING 65 MPH, THAT WOULD HAVE SENT ME INTO THE MEDIAN AND POSSIBLY CAUSED DEATH. I AM A FULL TIME STUDENT IN COLLEGE WORKING 2 JOBS SO I CAN PAY FOR THIS NOT EVEN FOUR MONTH OLD $20,000 CAR.
