ALL WIRING IS COMPLETELY DAMAGED AND THE MOTOR IS NON REPAIRABLE. THE FIRE WAS FROM UNDER THE HOOD, DRIVERS SIDE, NEAR THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID IT STARTED BEHIND THE FIREWALL. I HAVE SEEN ON THE NEWS AND HEARD ON THE RADIO THAT A FAULTY CRUISE CONTROL MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS DAMAGE. MY CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS. I HAVE CALLED 1-888-327-4236, AND THEY SAY THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALLS ON IT. WHY, MAY I ASK, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN ON THE NEWS AND RADIO IF THERE WERE TO BE NO RECALLS?  MY CAR IS STILL SETTING WHERE THE FIRE TOOK PLACE. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME KIND OF ANSWER INVOLVING THIS ISSUE. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO TRY TO FIX IT, MANY HAVE LOOKED AT IT AND SAID \"YOU KNOW THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS MAKE AND YEAR, CHECK INTO IT\".

IN 1998, THE SPEEDOMETER FAILED AT APPROXIMATELY 76,000 MILES.  IT WAS REPLACED AT MY COMPANY\u0012S EXPENSE.  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN JULY 1999.  IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR, WITH APPROXIMATELY 112,800 MILES (ONLY 36,800 MILES ON THE REPLACED SPEEDOMETER), IT FAILED AGAIN.  FORD HAS ISSUED TWO TSBS.  THE FIRST IN 1997, TSB 97-12-5 AND THE SECOND IN 1999, 99-7-9.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AT SHEEHY FORD IN RICHMOND VA, (MR. RON CRENSHEW), ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE REPAIRS DICTATED UNDER FORD\u0012S TSBS DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  IN FACT, FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED AT TWICE THE RATE.  CLEARLY FORD IS SELLING DEFECTIVE PARTS, BOTH ORIGINAL AND REPLACEMENT.  I HAVE TRIED TO WORK THIS OUT WITH THEM, ONLY TO HAVE POLICY WARRANTY SPOUTED AT ME.  THEY NEED TO FIX THIS.  I\u0012LL PAY THE LABOR.  THE PART IS OVER $500.  THIS IS ABSURD.  WE NOW HAVE A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE.   I NEED YOUR HELP.  THANK YOU.

WE TOOK OUR CAR TO SEVERAL MECHANICS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM.  NOTHING THAT WE HAD DONE EVER SEEMED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY, THIS PAST SUMMER IN THE HOT TEXAS HEAT THE PROBLEM BECAME TOO MUCH TO BEAR.  WE TOOK OUR TAURUS TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP--BRINSON FORD IN CORSICANA, TEXAS.  WE THOUGHT THAT SURELY THE DEALORSHIP MECHANICS WOULD BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE OUR PROBLEM.  THE DEALORSHIP TOLD US THAT THEY FELT OUR FUEL PUMP WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.  THEY TOLD US THAT OUR PUMP WOULD PROBABLY NOT LAST MUCH LONGER.  I QUESTIONED THEIR DIAGNOSIS SINCE WE HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM FOR 80,000 MILES.  WE PAID $556 AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTED.  FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE NOTICED THAT THE PROBLEM LESSENS AS THE TEMPERATURES DROP.  I AM CONVINCED THAT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUDGE MICHAEL BALLACHEY HAS HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

THE VIBRATION WAS HARD ENOUGH TO CAUSE A RUPTURE IN A A/C LINE, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED A COMPLETE A/C SYSTEM FAILURE.  A MAJOR LEAK WAS FOUND AT THE HIGH PRESSURE LINE TO CONDENSOR.

MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND HAVE HAD IT CHECKED OUT BY QUALIFIED MECHANICS, AND THEY TELL US IT IS THE FORWARD CLUTCH PISTON IN THE TRANSAXLE.  THERE HAVE BEEN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLITENS (TSB) PUT OUT BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY SINCE 1991 ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  I FEEL THAT THEY MADE MY CAR WITH A DEFECTIVE PART AND BOTH MYSELF AND ME TWO CHIRLREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE ALERT TRUCK DRIVER.  FORD HAS BEEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THROUGH TSB'S 91-5-7,92-1-4,92-26A-6, 93-9-11 AND 94-24-7 WHICH EVEN TELLS THE DEALERS NOT TO USE THE ALUMINUM PISTON AND IF THEY HAVE ANY IN STOCK TO RETURN THEM TO THE PARTS DEPOT FOR CREDIT.  MY FATHER MR. BOB PATTERSON HAS CONTACTED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT LAWYER WHO HAS REVIEWED THE TSB 94-24-7 AND HE FEELS THAT FORD IS TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR OF THE VEHICLE.  MR. PATTERSON HAS CALLED THE DEALER WHO REFERED HIM TO FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE 1-800-392-3673(JOY) WHO STATED IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT THEY COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  HE FURTHER CONTACTED MR. RON SUMNER FORD MOTER COMPANY PRIORITY SECTION 313-322-3000 WHO SAID IT WAS UP TO THE DEALER TO INITIATE ANY ACTION TO GET ASSISTANCE AND THEN STATED THAT HE DIDN'T THINK FORD WOULD OFFER ANY.  WHEN YOUR OFFICE WAS MENTIONED HE SAID THAT FORD WASN'T SCARED OF YOU.  ALSO HE WOULD NOT PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH MR. JAQUES NASSER (CEO FORD) WHEN ASKED TO FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE.  IN CALLING BACK THE DEALER AND TALKING TO MR. SATCHER HE STATED THAT IT WAS NOT HIS RESPONSIBLITY TO CONTACT FORD FOR A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT, BUT FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT TO IT.

FIFTEEN DAYS LATER ON 16JULY19 THE SMOKE STARTED POURING OUT OF THE VENTS AGAIN.  THIS IS THE 3RD A/C WHICH WAS FOR A CORE HEATER ASSY.

MY WIFE WAS DRIVING MY DAUGHTER TO SCHOOL WHEN THE CAR STARTED TO OVERHEAT AND RUN ROUGH. SHE MANAGED TO DRIVE IT TO A REPAIR SHOP. THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET. WE CONTACTED FORD SINCE MY WIFE HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THEM STATING THAT DUE TO REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH HEAD GASKETS THEY WERE EXTENDING THE WARANTY UNTIL THE END OF 1997 OR 60,000 MILES. WE MISSED IT BY A MONTH AND A HALF, OR 5,000 MILES, AND THEY WOULD DO NOTHING TO HELP US OUT. WE HAD THE CAR REPAIRED BUT THIS PAST WEEK, ON OCT. 14 THE NEW HEAD GASKET BLEW. BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER LETTERS THAT I HAVE READ ON VARIOUS INTERNET WEB SITES, IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING IS DEFECTIVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR MOTOR. ALTHOUGH IN MY CASE, WE HAD NO DANGER INVOLVED WITH THE BREAKDOWN, WE WERE LUCKY TO BE DRIVING IN TOWN WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF HELP. FORD HAS APPARENTLY NOT DONE ANYTHING TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM FOR THE OLDER MODELS LIKE MINE OR EVEN NEWER MODELS. I CALLED THEIR SERVICE TECHNICIAN NUMBER STATING MY CONCERN THAT SHOULD I REPAIR THE CAR AGAIN AT CONSIDERABLE COST, IT WOULD PROBABLY NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I INDICATED THAT MY ONLY RECOURSE WAS TO TRADE THE CAR IN AND LET THE PENDING PROBLEM END UP BEING SOME OTHER UNSUSPECTING PERSONS BURDEN.
