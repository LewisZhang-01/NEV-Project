THE MECHANIC SPOKE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND FINALLY SEEMED TO HAVE IT FIGURED OUT. $50 WAS THE PRICE I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE LEFT WITH. AFTER RUNNING TEST AND DIAGNOSTICS, PRICES CHANGED AND MORE WORK WAS NEEDED. ITS BEEN A LITTLE OVER 2 MONTHS SINCE IVE BEEN WITHOUT. NOW IM TOLD I NEED TO PAY IN FULL $1500 BEFORE THEY WILL WORK ON MY VEHICLE.  I HAVENT BEEN OFFERED A RENTAL MUCHLESS BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE WORK DONE.

THE FACT THAT NO ONE HAS DIED YET FROM LOSING CONTROL WHEN THEIR JEEP STARTS VIOLENTLY SHAKING WHILE THEY'RE SPEEDING DOWN THE HIGHWAY (THAT WE CAN PROVE) DUE TO AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW IN THESE VEHICLES IS A SHAMEFUL REASON FOR THE NHTSA TO DISMISS THIS ISSUE.

I'VE BEEN LUCKY TO BE GOING SLOW ENOUGH TO REDUCE MY SPEED BEFORE I LOST CONTROL.  I'VE STOPPED DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, STOPPED DRIVING LONG DISTANCES, AND PLAN TO TRASH MY JEEP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THOUGH I JUST INVESTED $1,000 IN ITS REPAIR.  IS THAT RIGHT?  *TR",

I CHECKED TO SEE IF A RECALL HAD BEEN MADE OR A SAFETY BULLETIN BEEN ISSUED AND FOUND IT HAD NOT, BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAD MADE INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS, MANY WITH MUCH SADDER CONSEQUENCES WHILE DRIVING AT SPEED ON INTERSTATES AND SUPERHIGHWAYS, WAS SIZABLE AND QUITE HONESTLY FRIGHTENING.

THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES SUDDENLY IN YOUR HANDS, THE FRONT END WOBBLES AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  SLOWING DOWN BELOW 50MPH USUALLY RESOLVES THE ISSUE...BUT THAT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION.  SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS WARMED UP AND HAS TRAVELED 20+ MILES.  A MAJOR NATIONAL TV CHANNEL HAS PRODUCED A NEWS ARTICLE ABOUT THIS WITH FILM OF THE VEHICLE DURING THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\".  WE BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS HAS ASKED JEEP ABOUT THIS ISSUE PREVIOUSLY.  THE JEEP COMPANY IN OUR TOWN SUGGESTED ROTATING TIRES AND CHECKING BRAKES.  THEY CLAIM TO HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER THERE ARE LOTS OF ONLINE COMPLAINTS.  IN ADDITION TO LOTS OF COMPLAINTS, THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF MONEY SPENT ON LOTS OF PARTS AND LABOR TO FIX THE ISSUE.  EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION AS TO WHAT THE PROBLEM AND SOLUTION ARE.  EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ONLY 45000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, IT CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO PROVIDE A SAFE JOURNEY.  WE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COMPANY AND VEHICLE.  HOPING FOR A RECALL SOON!  (ON A SIDE NOTE, A NEIGHBOR OF OURS HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS SAME ISSUE WITH HIS JEEP.  IF WE ARE AWARE OF 2 PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE, IT HAS TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE.)  PLEASE HELP.

A, DATED OCTOBER 2, 1998, WHICH SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM YOUR FILES AND NOTED IN THE BOUND TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN BOOK, PUBLICATION NUMBER 81-699-99003. THIS IS A COMPLETE REVISION TO THE PROCEDURE.    OVERVIEW:  THIS BULLETIN INVOLVES INSTALLING A REPAIR HARNESS CONTAINING A REVISED INSTRUMENT CLUSTER CONNECTOR.    SYMPTOM/CONDITION:  SOME VEHICLES MAY EXHIBIT AN INTERMITTENT ILLUMINATION OF THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT OR AN INTERMITTENT TACHOMETER OR SPEEDOMETER DROP OUT. AN AIRBAG ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE (AECM) FAULT CODE -\"NO CLUSTER CCD BUS \" MESSAGE WILL BE PRESENT.    DIAGNOSIS:  USING THE DRB III, READ AND RECORD ALL ACTIVE AND STORED FAULT CODES IN THE AECM. THIS CONDITION IS CAUSED BY MINOR OXIDATION OF THE BUS CIRCUIT TERMINALS AT THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER CONNECTOR. ELECTRICAL TERMINALS WILL SHOW SIGNS OF OXIDATION, WHICH WILL APPEAR AS DARKENED LINES OR MARKS ON THE CLUSTER MALE TERMINALS. THESE OFTEN APPEAR AS GRAY OR BLACK MARKS RATHER THAN THE APPEARANCE OF OXIDATION OR CORROSION USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CURRENT CARRYING CIRCUITS. THIS CONDITION WILL SET A \"NO CLUSTER CCD BUS\" MESSAGE. THE FAULT CODE WILL USUALLY BE STORED AND NOT ACTIVE. THIS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN WILL NOT ADDRESS FUEL OR OIL PRESSURE GAUGE ISSUES. IF THIS FAULT CODE IS PRESENT, EITHER ACTIVE OR STORED PERFORM THE REPAIR PROCEDURE.    THIS SERVICE BULLETIN IS COMMON WITH ALL JEEPS.  THERE ARE MANY JEEP OWNERS WITH THIS VERY PROBLEM.  *TR",

I ADVISED THE SELLER ONCE I FOUND OUT. I WAS TOLD BY THE PERSON WHO PICKED UP THE PHONE THAT I WILL BE CALLED BACK REGARDING THIS MATTER. NO ONE CALLED. ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, I DROVE TO BRAKEWAY TO HAVE THE BRAKES LOOKED AT BECAUSE THE LIGHTS CAME ON. BRAKEWAY ADVISED THE SAME ISSUES AS M-L. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO JIM BROWN AUTO AND REQUESTED THE TRUCK BE LOOKED AT. THEY ACCEPTED THE TRUCK BUT REFUSED TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT WERE POINTED OUT. I JUST NEED SOME JUSTICE REGARDING THIS VEHICLE.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",

I TOOK IT INTO GET REPAIRED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT FOGGING OR DEFROSTING MY VEHICLES WINDSHIELD AND I WAS UNABLE TO SEE DURING THE WINTER WHEN I WAS DRIVING UP TO COLORADO AND HAD TO STOP EVERY FEW MINUTES TO WIPE OFF THE CONDENSATION.  THIS WAS A TERRIFYING EVENT SINCE IT WAS SNOWING ON THE HIGHWAY I WAS TRAVELING ON AND THERE WERE VEHICLES TRYING TO CONTROL THEIR OWN VEHICLES WHICH I COULD NOT SEE.  AT ONE POINT WHEN I NEEDED TO PULL THE VEHICLE OVER AND WIPE OFF THE CONDENSATION AND UNFREEZE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FROM THE WINDSHIELD I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE RAILING AND HIT IT, THANKFULLY I WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 5 MPH BUT I STILL BANGED UP MY BUMPER A LITTLE BUT AT LEAST I DIDN'T DIE.    THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE SINCE IT HAS NOW GONE OUT AGAIN IN LESS THAN 5,000 MILES.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS NOT RECALLED THE PARTS THAT CAUSE THIS PROBLEM AND ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO DIE FROM THIS DESIGN BEFORE THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND RECALL.  IT COSTS MORE THAN $800 TO REPAIR THE FIRST TIME AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO FIX THIS ISSUE JUST SO THAT I CAN SEE THE CARS THAT ARE ON THE ROAD AND THE LINES TO STAY IN MY LANE.  PLEASE HELP! *TR",

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BLEND DOORS, AND WILL LIKELY COST BETWEEN $1,000 AND $1,500 TO FIX. THE REPAIR REQUIRES A COMPLETE DISASSEMBLY OF THE DASH AND STEERING COLUMN (AROUND 10-12 HOURS FOR A FULL REPAIR, ACCORDING TO THE SHOP).    I BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND ONLINE TO SEE WHAT ELSE COULD BE DONE. TO MY SURPRISE, NEARLY EVERY JEEP MESSAGE BOARD WAS FLOODED WITH POSTS ABOUT THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THE ENGINEERING OF THE PART VIRTUALLY ENSURES THAT IT WILL FAIL; THE CALIBRATION PHASE (EVERY 20 OR SO START-UPS) FORCES THE PLASTIC PART TO ITS LIMITS AND EVENTUALLY BREAKS. EVERY DEALERSHIP OR AUTO REPAIR SHOP THAT I CONTACTED SAID THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY 1999 AND NEWER GRAND CHEROKEE HAS, OR WILL HAVE, THIS PROBLEM.    THE ISSUE ISN'T PAYING FOR CAR REPAIR; EVERY CAR HAS PROBLEMS THAT WE AS CONSUMERS WILL NEED PAY TO GET FIXED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ENGINEERING OF THIS PART CAUSES IT TO FAIL, AND NOW I'M STUCK NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFROST MY WINDSHIELD IN THE WINTER, OR NOW IN SPRINGTIME WHEN IT RAINS. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS HAS ALREADY, OR WILL CAUSE IN THE FUTURE, ACCIDENTS FROM PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE.

TO PROPERLY REPAIR YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE RESISTOR AND THE DASHBOARD WIRING HARNESS... VERY COSTLY!! $600+  2.  NO HEAT DUE TO BAD BLEND DOORS.  $1200+  3.  BOTH OF THESE APPEAR TO AFFECT JEEPS 1999-2004 YEAR MODELS    HOW CAN JEEP CONTINUE TO KNOWINGLY SALE AUTOMOBILES WITH   1 - A FIRE AND SAFETY HAZARD WITH THE FAULTY RESISTOR?  2 - A SAFETY HAZARD WITH NO HEAT DUE TO FAULTY BLEND DOORS?    GOOGLE IT... BOTH OF THESE ARE VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THESE VEHICLES AND ARE NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS.     PLEASE LOOK AT THESE TWO LINKS PROVIDED.  THEY JUST START TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF HOW BAD THIS PROBLEM REALLY IS.    JEEP SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS AS THEY ARE BOTH SAFETY ISSUES AND THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM PRIOR TO THE SALE, NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF REPAIRING THESE ITEMS PLACES AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON THE OWNER SINCE FAIR TRADE WOULD MANDATE THESE KNOWN AND RECURRING DEFECTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED PRIOR TO SALE.

DESCRIPTION: BRAKE ROUGHNESS OR PEDAL PULSATION WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. THE CUSTOMER MAY EXPERIENCE A VIBRATION OF THE STEERING WHEEL, FLOOR, SEAT, INSTRUMENT PANEL, OR A MINOR PEDAL PULSATION (BRAKE ROUGHNESS) UNDER LIGHT TO MODERATE PEDAL APPLICATION. THE CONDITION MAY BE CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE THICKNESS VARIATION OF THE BRAKE ROTOR SURFACE.    DETAILS: THIS BULLETIN INVOLVES THE REPLACEMENT OF BOTH FRONT BRAKE ROTORS AND CALIPER ASSEMBLIES. NOTE: NEW BRAKE ROTORS MUST BE USED WITH THE NEW BRAKE CALIPERS.    DIAGNOSIS:  1. DETERMINE IF THE FRONT BRAKE VIBRATION/PULSATION IS CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE THICKNESS VARIATION OF EITHER FRONT BRAKE ROTOR.  2. IF EXCESSIVE THICKNESS VARIATION OF THE FRONT BRAKE ROTOR IS AT FAULT PERFORM THE REPAIR PROCEDURE.  3. IF THIS BULLETIN HAS ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED, AND FRONT BRAKE PULSATION/VIBRATION IS PRESENT, DO NOT PERFORM THE REPAIR PROCEDURE.

THIS PROBLEM WILL LAST ANYWHERE FROM 5 TO 15 SECONDS (APPROXIMATELY - I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY TIMED IT) BEFORE IT STRAIGHTENS BACK OUT WHERE I CAN AGAIN ACCELERATE.  I HAVE HAD VEHICLES HAVE TO SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES TO KEEP FROM HITTING ME BECAUSE I CAN NOT ACCELERATE.  BELOW IS A WHAT I HAVE DONE TO ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM (IN THE ORDER IT WAS DONE):  1)PLUGS WERE REPLACED AT HOME  2)FUEL INJECTORS WERE CLEANED BY CERTIFIED MECHANIC (NOT AT DEALERSHIP)  3)POWER TRAIN CONTROL MODULE (COMPUTER) (USED PART) REPLACED AT DEALERSHIP (AT THIS TIME I DID CONTACT JEEP BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WAS ONLY 2,000 MILES PASSED THE WARRANTY - THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST ME THE REPLACEMENT)  4)COIL PACK REPLACED AT HOME    THIS VEHICLE HAS SPENT MANY DAYS IN THE SHOP AND WITH ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED AND ALL OF THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, THEY STILL CAN NOT TELL ME HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE REPLACED $600 WORTH OF PERFECTLY GOOD PARTS.  THIS VEHICLE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  SO MUCH THAT I WILL NO LONGER ALLOW ANYONE TO DRIVE IT.    I SPOKE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AT JEEP AGAIN TODAY AND BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY (APPROX. 83,000 MILES), THEY WILL NOT CONSIDER HELPING ME.  HOWEVER, THEIR TECHNICIANS ALSO STATED THAT THEY WERE \"STUMPED\".",

ALL INSTALLMENTS PRIOR TO THE ONE AT 51,000 MILES HAVE BEEN AT THE JEEP DEALER.  EACH TIME, WHEN I QUESTIONED WHY SUCH FREQUENT REPLACEMENT WAS NEEDED, I WAS TOLD \"IT'S A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM\".   THE MOST RECENT ROTOR CHANGE (AT 51,000 MILES) WAS PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED PERSON AT AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE.   HE TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO HIM  TO BE A DESIGN FLAW RESULTING IN MISALIGNMENT OF THE BRAKE CALIPERS, ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS SUCH THAT ONE OF THE TWO BRAKE PISTONS BRAKES IS STRIKING ITS TARGET SLIGHTLY OFF-CENTER.  CONTINUOUS MISALIGNMENT OF THE BRAKE PISTONS APPEARS TO BE CAUSING THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS TO WEAR UNEVENLY RESULTING IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE VIBRATION.  SO REPLACING THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR NOW BUT IS ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION.

WHEN THE CAR IS 7000 MILES + ON THE RESURFACED OR REPLACED ROTORS, I DON'T LEND THE CAR TO ANYONE BECAUSE OF SAFETY.  IF YOU HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE RESULTS FROM BRAKING ON WARPED ROTORS, YOU WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY HANDLING THIS VEHICLE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  DOES SOMEONE NEED TO BE INJURED OR WORSE, DIE, FOR DAIMLER CHRYSLER OR NHTSA TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM?  THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND DAIMLER CHRYSLER SHOULD REMEDY THE PROBLEM AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.*AK",

ONE LOCAL DEALER ACKNOWLEDGES THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM - ONE DENIES THEY EVER HEARD OF IT.

A WOMAN AT CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS LAST WEEK PUT ME ON HOLD WHEN I CALLED IN AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE SAID SHE WAS READING A SIMILAR COMPLAINT.

ON DEC. 23, 2002 WE BROKE DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE A ROCKER ARM SPRING BROKE CAUSING A ROD TO BREAK THROUGH THE VALVE COVER AND DROP DOWN INTO THE ENGINE CAUSING $1600 IN DAMAGE.  THE JEEP HAS 43,000 MILES ON IT AND IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  WE PURCHASED THE JEEP IN FEB. 2002 AND SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE REPLACED THE ROTORS, A LEAKING SEALS AND NOW THE ENGINE PROBLEM.  WHEN WE APPROACHED CHRYSLER ABOUT POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR BILL, WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF ENGING PROBLEMS AND WE DID NOT PURCHASE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SO THEY WOULD NOT HELP US.  OUR POINT IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBTFUL THAT THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE HAD THIS KIND OF PROBLEM (NOR SHOULD IT HAVE THIS PROBLEM) WITH SUCH LOW MILES.  ALSO, WE WERE NEVER OFFERED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE SALESMAN HE STATED THAT COST WAS AN ISSUE WHEN BUYING THE JEEP SO HE DIDN'T WANT THE PRICE TO BE ANY HIGHER.  ISN'T COST ALWAYS THE ISSUE WHEN BUYING A NEW CAR AND SHOULDN'T WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED A CHANCE TO PURCHASE THE WARRANTY?  WE FEEL THAT A $6 SPRING SHOULDN'T CAUSE $1600 TO AN ENGINE ANYHOW.  IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD BE OF HELP TO US?",

THE AUTOPARK MECHANIC HAD TO GO TO HIS SHOP WARRANTY MANUAL ON PAGE 300 AND SOMETHING TO FIND THE SMALL PRINT.  AGAIN, IT IS NOT IN OUR WARRANTY INFORMATION.

THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START AND STAY RUNNING ON JUNE 3, 2002.  UPON THE 2ND ATTEMPT TO START THE VEHICLE, I SMELLED GAS, TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF, AND GAS POURED OUT OF THE VEHICLE ONTO THE GROUND.

THIS IS ONLY 3,070 MILES SINCE THE ROTORS WERE TURNED. I AM SURE THIS TIME, ONCE AGAIN, THE ROTORS WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE NHTSA WEBSITE HAS NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM, AS DO OTHER WEBSITES. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT TAKES FOR A RECALL, BUT I THINK IT IS TIME THAT SOMETHING IS DONE.

I MANAGED TO MOVE THE CAR TO THE RIGHT, WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, WITHOUT HITTING A PARKED CAR IN FRONT OF ME. MY FRONT RIGHT TIRE OF THE CAR CRASHED INTO THE CURB AND STOPPED.  THE CAR WAS PARKED AT AN ANGLE NOT PARALLEL TO THE CURB AND I WAS AFRAID THAT SOME OTHER CAR MIGHT HIT ME FROM BEHIND BECAUSE OF THE WAY MY CAR WAS STOPPED. I WAS SHAKEN UP A LOT AND WHEN FINALLY GOT OUT OF THE CAR I SAW FLUIDS LEAKING OUT FROM THE FRONT OF MY CAR ONTO THE STREET.  A COUPLE OF PEOPLE CAME OUT OF A BUSINESS STOREFRONT AND SAW THE FLUIDS LEAKING OUT FAST ONTO THE STREET.ONE GUY SAID THAT WAS OIL LEAKING AND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE. IT WAS ALREADY DARK (AROUND 5 P.M. PST).I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND BOTH MY HUSBAND & MY BROTHER CAME TO THE LOCATION TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG AND BOTH COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY OIL WAS LEAKING.  THE CAR COULD NOT START AND A TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED AND TOWED THE CAR TO A JEEP DEALER (WHERE WE NORMALLY HAVE THE CAR SERVICED) IN ALHAMBRA.THE FOLLOWING DAY THE JEEP DEALER'S MECHANICS EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND THEY SAID THE WHOLE ENGINE WAS TAKEN OUT AND THAT APPARENTLY THERE'S A HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE BLOCK. THREE DAYS LATER MY COUSIN (ALSO A MECHANIC) WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE ENGINE AND SAID THAT THE CONNECTING ROD INSIDE THE ENGINE BROKE AND THUS MADE A HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE.

I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  WHEN I GOT IN THE VEHICLE TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE YARD, IT WAS IN REVERSE.  LUCKILY IT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO MAKE IT UP THE BANK OF THE YARD OR IT WOULD HAVE WENT THROUGH MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE.  NO ONE WAS INJURED NOR WAS THERE ANY DAMAGE TO THE JEEP.  IT JUMPED OUT OF PARK AND SLIPPED INTO REVERSE ON ITS OWN.  I AM 100% SURE OF THIS!!  I BOUGHT THE CAR BC I WANTED SOMETHING SAFE TO HAUL MY FAMILY AROUND IN...WE JUST HAD OUR FIRST CHILD.  NOW, AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I DON'T FEEL SAFE AT ALL.  MY WIFE IS EXTREMELY AFRAID OF IT NOW ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A NEWBORN...NOTHING LIKE MAKING A HUGE CAR PAYMENT FOR SOMETHING THAT DRIVES ITSELF.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE NET AND IT APPEARS THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  THE FIGURES ARE NOW APPROACHING 1000 REPORTS OF THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT.  I LIKE THE JEEP, I WISH SOMETHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT THE PROBLEM.   IF NOTHING IS DONE BY CHRYSLER IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I AM GOING TO SELL IT BC MY WIFE WON'T EVEN RIDE IN THE CAR ANYMORE..ESPECIALLY WITH THE BABY.  IF I DO SELL THE VEHICLE, I HOPE IT DOES NOT INJURE OR  KILL OF THE NEW BUYER!!  CHRYSLER HAS PROBLEM, THEY NEED TO FIX IT BEFORE PEOPLE START GETTING SERIOUSLY HURT.*AK",

SAFETY IS A MAJOR CONCERN SINCE THE PROBLEM BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCED UNDER URGENT BRAKING CONDITIONS.  JEEP SERVICE HAS MADE SIX (6) ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SUCCESS. HISTORY:THE JEEP SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE SIX (6) UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM ONLY TO HAVE IT REAPPEAR APPROXIMATED 5,000 MILES AFTER EACH SERVICE ATTEMPT. THE WARRANTY PERIOD FOR THE BRAKE SYSTEM HAS NOW EXPIRED AND IN SPITE OF THE SIX FAILED ATTEMPTS \u0016 THE JEEP SERVICE AREA MANAGER HAS SUGGESTED THAT HE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO PAY THE COST OF THESE SERVICE CALLS AND IT WILL BECOME MY RESPONSIBILITY.

THERE HAS BEEN NO REASSURANCE THAT THIS WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS: THE CAUSE OF THE \u0011PULSATING\u0012 PROBLEM HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A CONDITION THAT IS CAUSING THE BRAKE ROTORS TO OVER-HEAT AND THEN WARP.  THE SIX (6) ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM HAVE ENTAILED FOUR (4) FRONT WHEELS ROTOR RESURFACING EXPERIMENTS, ONE (1) FRONT WHEELS ROTOR REPLACEMENT AND ONE (1) RECOMMENDATION THIS WEEK TO REPLACE THE ROTORS AGAIN.

FURTHERMORE, THE MANUFACTURER'S POSITION IS THAT THEY WILL REPAIR OR REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE BRAKES FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME ON A NEW CAR, BUT AFTER THAT (EVEN WHILE THE CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY) THEY WILL CONSIDER FURTHER REPAIRS TO BE \"NOT THE MANUFACTURERS' RESPONSIBILITY\".

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PURCHASE (NOT LEASE) OF MY GC,  MY WIFE AND I NOTICED A STRONG JOLT IN THE REAR END OF THE VEHICLE WHENEVER WE CAME TO A STOP.  I BROUGHT OUR VEHICLE BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP 2 TIMES FOR INSPECTION BUT EACH TIME MY DEALER, MANHATTAN JEEP (A 5-STAR DEALER IN NEW YORK CITY) TOLD US THAT \"ALL OF THE NEW '99S DO THAT\" AND THAT \"ALL THE ONES WITH THE V8 DO THAT\".  THAT WASN'T WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT GO AWAY AFTER A FEW MORE MILES.  I NOW HAVE OVER 7,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AND THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE.  I HAVE WRITTEN TO CUSTOMER RELATIONS AT DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO REPORT MY PROBLEM.  I DO HAVE A CASE NUMBER WHICH THEY'VE ASSIGNED TO ME.  I WAS TOLD BY CUSTOMER RELATIONS THAT I SHOULD TRY ANOTHER DEALER.  SINCE I WAS GETTING NO SATISFACTION FROM CUSTOMER RELATIONS, I CALLED THE SALES DEPARTMENT AT DIFEO CHRYSLER IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY AND SPOKE TO A SALES REPRESENTATIVE.  I POSED AS A POTENTIAL BUYER OF A 2000 GRAND CHEROKEE.  I ASKED ABOUT THE QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT THE 1999 MODEL HAD AND I WAS TOLD BY THE SALESPERSON THAT ALL OF THE 1999S PRODUCED BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1999 HAD A DEFECTIVE DRIVESHAFT AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE REPLACED.  HE ASSURED ME THAT THE DEFECTS HAD BEEN CORRECTED FOR THE 2000 MODEL YEAR.  SO NOW I HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE DENYING THE PROBLEM WHILE THE SALES DEPARTMENT WAS VERY WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. I NOW SCHEDULED A SERVICE APPOINTMENT AT BAYSIDE CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH-JEEP IN BAYSIDE, NEW YORK.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT BAYSIDE IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A NEW DRIVESHAFT #52099487AC.

I'LL LOSE POWER TO THE TRANSMISSION, BUT ALL THE ELECTRICAL ITEMS WILL STILL WORK, SUCH AS THE RADIO AND HEATER. WHEN THE ENGINE DIES OUT, THE CHECK ENGINE AND AIRBAG LIGHTS WILL DISPLAY. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF TWO DEALERSHIPS BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED. ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT I WILL FEEL A BIG CLUNK WHEN I AM ACCELERATING, USUALLY WHEN I FIRST START TO DRIVE OFF. THE SECOND TYPE OF CLUNK I FEEL IS WHEN I PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE TO DRIVE. I WILL FEEL A BIG BANG LIKE SOMEBODY HAD HIT ME FROM BEHIND. THIS WILL SPECIFICALLY  HAPPEN DURING THE SHIFT FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE. THE THIRD PROBLEM I ENCOUNTER HAPPENS WHEN I HAVE MY HEATER ON. I WILL HAVE THE CONTROL SETTINGS SET @80'S AND THE AIR CONDITIONER WILL OPERATE. I DO NOT HAVE THE SETTING AT DEFROST MODE. IT IS IN REGULAR MODE AND WHEN I WANT THE HEAT, THE AC PLUS THE HEAT WILL TRIGGER. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT IF THESE PROBLEMS WERE LOOKED INTO. THANK YOU. *AK",

MY DEALER, WHO IS VERY RELIABLE, TOOK THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THE FRONT ROTORS AND REAR DRUMS WARPED.  AT FIRST THEY INFORMED ME THAT CHRYSLER HAD CHNGED ROTORS WITHOUT NOTIFYING THEM.  UPON THEIR FURTHER EXAMINATION THEY FOUND THAT MY JEEP HAD THE OLD PARTS AND THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS AND DRUMS.  AT 17,300 MILES I NOTICED THE SAME VIBRATION IN THE FRONT END WHEN BRAKING ON I84 IN CT.  THE DEALER AGAIN INSPECTED THE ROTORS AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE DEFECTIVE.  THIS TIME THEY WILL TURN THE ROTORS \"ON THE VEHICLE\"  WITH CHRYSLER'S OKAY.  WHILE THE WORK IS UNDER WARRANTY I QUESTION WHETHER THIS WILL BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  MY COMPLAINT IS NO WAY TO BE CONSTRUED AS AGAINST THE DEALER, IN FACT THE DEALER ENCOURAGED ME TO CONTACT CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHICH I DID.
