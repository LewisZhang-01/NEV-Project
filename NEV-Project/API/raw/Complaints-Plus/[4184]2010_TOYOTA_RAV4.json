On Sunday afternoon, I was driving back to my home from South Lake Tahoe. I drove for almost 40 miles and suddenly the steering got locked while I was driving the car.   There was no prior indication of steering lock lights before I start the car. The steering got locked suddenly in a winding road.   I called Geico roadside assistance and towed the car and it is with Thomsons Toyota, placerville, ca. The dealer told me that they found issue with alternator and battery.  The reason I am reporting this issue is it should have steering lock light turned on before I start the car, so that it could avoid potential accident situation.

If something is recalled it should be fixed correctly and not be a bandaid job.  There should not be a cost associated with a cheap fix that caused more problems.

RECENTLY I PURCHASED NEW TIRES AT A FIRESTONE DEALER AND PURCHASED A A LIFETIME ALIGNMENT. WHEN THEY PERFORMED THE ALIGNMENT FOR FRONT AND REAR, BOTH NEEDED A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. I WAS INFORMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE AND THEY CAN ONLY ADJUST THE FRONT AS THE REAR HAD A TAG THAT STATES \"ONLY TO BE SERVICED BY AN AUTHORIZED TOYOTA DEALER.\"  FURTHERMORE, WHEN TOYOTA SERVICED THE RECALL, THEY PAINTED EPOXY OVER THE ENTIRE ARM. NOW THIS LEAVES FOR A VERY EXPENSIVE FIX. THE RECALL SOLUTION MADE BY TOYOTA DISABLED THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE TOE IN TOE OUT FUNCTION TO ALIGN THIS VEHICLE PROPERLY. I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THE WHOLE SUSPENSION NEEDS TO BE REDONE WITH NEW PARTS AND NEW KITS COSTING 200 DOLLARS PLUS LABOR. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A ENGINEERING PROBLEM. THE RECALL FIX DID NOT ALLOW AN ADJUSTABLE ARM AND THIS WILL CAUSE AN UNEVEN WEAR ON MY BRAND NEW TIRES.  THIS IS WRONG AND TOYOTA FEELS THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY ON THIS MATTER AND IS LAYING THIS BLAME ON THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY RECALLS.  IN MY OPINION ANOTHER RECALL SHOULD BE IN ORDER. PEOPLE THAT OWN THESE VEHICLES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT CHARGES TO FIX AN ALREADY RECALLED  REAR SUSPENSION PROBLEM. WITH ALL THE ROAD HAZARDS ALIGNMENT PROBLEMS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME OR ANYTIME, AN ALIGNMENT IS BOUND TO OCCUR. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO GET THE MANUFACTURES TO OWN UP TO THE INADEQUACY OF THE RECALL SOLUTION THEY PERFORMED. P.S. SOME OF US CONSUMERS KEEP OUR CARS FOR A LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE.  AND I KNOW TOYOTA LIKES TO BRAG ABOUT THE LONGEST LASTING MOST DEPENDABLE CAR ON THE ROAD.  I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT KEEP MY CARS MAINTAINED AT I'S MAXIMUM DRIVING CAPACITY.",

WHEN I INSPECTED THEM I COULD SEE THAT A COUPLE MORE LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE ALSO STRETCHED BETWEEN THE THREADS, MOST LIKELY FROM OVER TORQUING. KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY BREAK ALSO, I DECIDED TO REINSTALL THE WHEEL ANYWAY AND SEE AT WHAT TORQUE POINT THE OTHERS WOULD BREAK.

THE REPLACEMENT BOLTS, WAGNER BRAKE BRAND, ARE MARKED AS A METRIC 10.9 STRENGTH BOLT, EQUIVALENT TO A SAE GRADE 8. THESE ARE RATED TO TAKE +/- 100 FT. LBS. TORQUE.

I'M 53 YEARS OLD, MY RAV-4 HAS ALWAYS HAD ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION, NOT ABUSED AND ALWAYS WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  WITHOUT WARNING TODAY WHILE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 60 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED VIBRATING AND SHARPLY TURNING LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS WITH A GRINDING AND SHAKING NOISE IN THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE.  I USED ALL MY STRENGTH TO KEEP THE CAR POINTED STRAIGHT WHILE TRYING TO SLOW DOWN AND NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.   THEN THE CAR SHARPLY VEERED LEFT AND HIT (HARD) A 5-FOOT CONCRETE BARRIER WALL SEPARATING THE INTERSTATE LANES.  AS THIS WAS OCCURRING  A RED TRIANGLE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON THE DASHBOARD WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT I LOOKED IN THE TOYOTA RAV-4 OWNERS MANUAL, AND IT INDICATED AN \"EPS MALFUNCTION\".   THE VEHICLE SUSTAINED MAJOR DAMAGE (INSURANCE ESTIMATE STILL PENDING, PROBABLY ABOUT $8,000).  MORE IMPORTANTLY HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IF THE CONCRETE RETAINING WALL HADN'T BEEN THERE MY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE TURNED LEFT, ROLLED OVER INTO APPROACHING ON-COMING TRAFFIC FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE AND POTENTIALLY CAUSED MUCH GREATER SAFETY RISK TO ON-COMING TRAFFIC AND DAMAGE.  IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE WALL WAS THERE.  I SUSTAINED BACK INJURIES.  THERE WAS ALSO A WITNESS IN BACK OF ME WHO SAW THE ENTIRE THING WITH THE ERRATIC STEERING AND RESULTING ACCIDENT; HE STOPPED TO ENSURE WAS OK AND HE CALLED 911 AND MADE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE CAR TOWED IN (AT MY EXPENSE), WHICH WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA 800 NUMBER AND THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR ANY OF THE EXPENSES.  THEY SAID THAT IF SOMETHING WAS FOUND WRONG WITH THE CAR, THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME.  I DROVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT NIGHT.  THE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP THE CAR UNTIL THE REGIONAL MANAGER COULD COME, WHICH WOULD BE SEVERAL DAYS.  THEY CALLED ME THE NEXT AFTERNOON TO SAY THAT THE DEALERSHIP HAD RUN ALL TESTS, AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, AND THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE RAV 4 HAVING THIS ISSUE.  THEY SAID THEY COULD KEEP THE CAR UNTIL THE REGIONAL MANAGER COULD COME, WHICH WAS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 2-3 WEEKS.  THEY SAID HE WOULD RUN THE EXACT SAME TESTS ON THE VEHICLE AS THEY HAD RUN.

I WAS STOPPING FOR A RED LIGHT ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY IN SEAL BEACH, CALIFORNIA AT THE CORNER OF FIRST STREET WHEN I NOTICED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO APPLY THE BRAKE, AND THE CAR DID NOT APPEAR TO WANT TO STOP. I APPLIED THE BRAKE MORE FORCEFULLY AND WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO STOP IN THE LEFT HAND TURN LANE, HOWEVER THE CAR KEPT LURCHING FORWARD AS IF IT WANTED TO BREAK FREE OF THE BRAKE.     HAVING HEARD THE WIDESPREAD PUBLICITY REGARDING THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION PROBLEM IN TOYOTA VEHICLES, AND HAVING PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM ON ONE OCCASION OVER A YEAR EARLIER, I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE THE ISSUE. I PUT THE CAR INTO PARK AND THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY REVVED UP TO AN ALARMING RATE. I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION IN PANIC BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE TACHOMETER. HOWEVER, JUDGING BY THE SOUND AND LATER EXPERIMENTATION WITH REVVING WHILE PARKED, I BELIEVE THE RPM MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE 4000-5000 RANGE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.     I WAS PARTICULARLY SHAKEN BY THIS EVENT BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY HAD THE RECALL SERVICE PERFORMED THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ISSUE. THIS RECALL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED MAY 10, 2011 AT DESERT TOYOTA IN TUCSON, ARIZONA.     I HAD EXPERIENCE THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ISSUE ONCE BEFORE, BUT IT WAS NOT NEARLY AS DRAMATIC. I DO NOT RECALL THE DETAILS, BUT IT WAS IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA IN EARLY 2011 AND MY MEMORY IS THAT TAPPING THE ACCELERATOR AND BRAKE PEDALS RESTORED THE CAR'S OPERATION TO NORMAL FAIRLY QUICKLY. I WAS LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT IT HAPPENING AGAIN SINCE THE RECALL SERVICE HAD BEEN PERFORMED.  *TR",

IT WAS NOT TOUCHING THE THROTTLE PEDAL AND THE THROTTLE PEDAL DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE I STARTED THE ENGINE A SECOND TIME AND THE SAME THING OCCURRED. I THEN WAITED APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES, PUMPED THE THROTTLE PEDAL SEVERAL TIMES, THEN STARTED THE VEHICLE A THIRD TIME. THIS TIME THE VEHICLE STARTED NORMALLY (ENGINE IDLING). I THEN DROVE HOME WITHOUT FURTHER REVING ISSUES AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY REOCCURENCE SINCE THE INCIDENT DATE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE THE NEXT DAY AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS A FLOORMAT ISSUE, AND MY DRIVERSIDE FLOORMAT WAS REMOVED BY THE DEALERSHIP. I DISAGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BEFORE I HAD THE REVING ISSUE UPON STARTING THE VEHICLE, MY LAST INTERACTION WITH THE VEHICLE WAS TO HAVE MY FOOT COMPLETELY OFF THE GAS PEDAL AS I WAS STEERING THE CAR INTO A PARKING SPACE, WHEN I WAS USING ONLY THE BRAKE PEDAL TO MODERATE MY SPEED, WITH NO THROTTLE PEDAL PRESSURE BEING APPLIED BY ME, AND WITH THE ENGINE IDLING, AS IS NORMAL. DO NOT SEE HOW THIS COULD BE A RESIDUAL STUCK THROTTLE PEDAL ISSUE WHEN I RETURNED TO MY AUTOMOBLE AND STARTED THE ENGINE TO DRIVE AWAY. THE ONLY OTHER FACTOR WHICH MAY (OR MAY NOT) BE RELEVENT WAS THAT WHEN I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AFTER PARKING, I DID NOT FIRST TURN THE RADIO OFF, WHICH I USUALLY DO.

I TRADED A 2007 PRUIS AND HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS TOYOTAS.  MY REASON FOR LEASING THE RAV 4 WAS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER AND SAFER FOR MY SPOUSE WHO IS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT.  I MADE THIS FACT KNOWN TO MY SALESMAN SONNY ROTHWELL AND BROUGHT HER WITH ME TO TEST HER GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND GENERAL COMFORT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT RUNNING DURING THIS TEST.    I DROVE THE VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 5000 MILES WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DASH WARNING LIGHT REGARDING AIR BAG ACTIVATION.  WHEN I FINALLY CHECKED WITH YOUR SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEY STATED THAT THE AIR BAG LIGHT INDICATES THAT THE AIR BAG IS NOT IN ACTIVE MODE WHEN OFF AND THAT THIS OCCURS WHEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WEIGHT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  I ASKED THE AMOUNT NEEDED TO ACTIVATE THE ON POSITION AND THEY DID NOT KNOW.  MY WIFE IS 5 1 AND WEIGHS 86 POUNDS AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEASED THIS VEHICLE IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AIR BAG SAFETY. AIR BAGS SAVED MY WIFE AND MOTHER IN-LAW  SEVERAL YEARS AGO.  I CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE 800 331-4331 AND EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM.  THEY STATED THAT IT REQUIRES 90LBS OF WEIGHT TO ACTIVATE AIR BAG AND THAT THIS COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED.  REF# 1012030063  I LATER CALLED SERVICE MANAGER DAVID NEWTON AND HE CONFIRMED THE 90 LB WEIGHT REQUIREMENT.  HE SUGGESTED I BRING THE CAR IN.  PRIOR TO BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, I TESTED THE FRONT SEAT BY HAVING MY WIFE SIT IN THE SEAT WITH A 16 LB BOWLING BALL ON HER LAP.  THE AIR BAG LIGHT WAS STILL SHOWING OFF. I ALSO READ MY OWNERS MANUAL AND FOUND NO INDICATION OF ANY WEIGHT REQUIREMENT FOR AIR BAG ACTIVATION.  THERE WERE REFERENCES TO CHILDREN AND LUGGAGE IN PASSENGER SEAT.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO YOUR DEAL  PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *CC",

EACH TIME I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION WAS THAT MY FOOT WAS OVERLAPPING THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WAS ALSO DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATION PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME. THE ACCELERATION WAS OVERRIDING THE BRAKING UNTIL I RELEASED PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE!  LAST WEEK I ALMOST KILLED A MOTHER AND HER YOUNG CHILD DURING A PARKING SITUATION.  I WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 5MPH WHEN I INTENDED TO COME TO A SLOW STOP OUTSIDE A NOSE IN PARKING SPOT.  THE YOUNG MOTHER WAS TIEING THE SHOESTRINGS OF HER YOUNGSTER NEAR THE OUTSIDE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING SPOT I INTENDED TO USE.  MY CAR WAS TRAVELING DIRECTLY TOWARD HER WHEN I SLOWLY DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL. THE CAR STARTED TO ACCELERATE!  I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND STOPPED THE CAR BY SHIFTING MY RIGHT FOOT TO THE LEFT WHICH ALLOWED ME TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUSLY DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL!  WE STOPPED ABOUT 8 FEET FROM THE MOTHER AND CHILD.  HAD I NOT EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE  AND THEREFORE HAD KNOWN HOW TO CORRECT IT,  MY RESPONSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL EVEN MORE. I COULD EASILY HAVE DRIVEN OVER THE MOTHER AND HER CHILD!    I AM AWARE THAT TOYOTA HAS A RECALL ON MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF UNINTENTIONAL ACCELERATIONS; BUT I AM UNAWARE OF ANY INVESTIGATIONS THE FOCUS ON THE CAUSE OF MY NEAR-FATAL INCIDENT.  I AM CERTAIN THAT SOME OF THE ACCIDENTS REPORTED ON THE RAV 4, V6 ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR PEDALS!  THIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED AND FIXED IMMEDIATELY!      I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO TOYOTA USA GILBERT DYER , TORRENCE CA ON JUNE 4, 2010 WITH THE REQUEST THAT HE FORWARD IT TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL AT TOYOTA. IT DEMANDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION!!!! *TR",

ON BOTH OCCASIONS I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE BUT IT WAS NOT SUBJECT TO RECALL BECAUSE OF THE \"J\" SERIAL.  I DID BRING THE CAR IN ON 2/17 AND WAS TOLD, AFTER INSPECTION, THAT SINCE NO SUDDEN ACCEL. WAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE SERVICE, NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND NO REMEDIAL ACTION COULD BE TAKEN.  MY CONTENTION, AND THE REASON FOR MY COMPLAINT IS THAT SUDDEN ACCELERATION IN THE RAV 4 IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, OCCURRING IN THIS CAR WITH A \"J\" SERIAL # AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE RECALL AND REMEDIATION SHOULD EXTEND TO THIS VEHICLE.  I DO BELIEVE THAT OTHER \"J\" SERIAL CARS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH CAUSES ME TO FURTHER QUESTION TOYOTA'S EXISTING RECALL PARAMETERS. *TR",
