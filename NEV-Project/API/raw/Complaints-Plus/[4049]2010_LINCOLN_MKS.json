I'VE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER MANY TIMES BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIX IT.  THEY DO SOME TYPE OF REPAIR BUT TO NO AVAIL. THEY KEEP SAYING FORD IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND IS WORKING ON A SOLUTION.  PROBLEM 2 WHICH IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS. THE ANTII-LOCK BRAKE LIGHT KEEPS GOING ON FOR NO REASON AND THE DEALER IS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED, THE BRAKES ACTUALLY LOCKED UP WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN.  I HAD TO SHUT THE CAR OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION UNTIL THE SYSTEM RESET. IT WAS DANGEROUS. WHEN I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALER, AGAIN THEY SAID IT THE CAR DID NOT REPORT A FAULT IN THE SYTEM AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAPPENS TO A TECH THEY CLAIM THEY CANNOT FIX IT.  *TW",
