WHEN I OPENED IT I FOUND THAT THE LINER INSIDE THE FUEL TANK HAD COME LOOSE OVER 80% OF THE TANK. THIS WAS STARTING TO BREAK APART INTO SMALL PIECES AND HAD STARTED PLUGGING THE FUEL FILTER. THIS HAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO CAUSE ENGINE FUEL STARVATION ESPECIALLY AT HIWAY SPEEDS AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A SERIOUS REAR END COLLISION. THROUGH THE INTERNET HARLEY GROUPS I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE MOTORCYCLES.",
