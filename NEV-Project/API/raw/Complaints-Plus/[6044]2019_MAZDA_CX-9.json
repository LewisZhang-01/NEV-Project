I have reported this to the dealership many times since purchasing the vehicle new. They continue to say that there is no issue but the noise is not going away. I believe it is associated with this TSB but no recall has been made. I am very concerned as the steering feels looser than usual and may cause an accident.  TSB 10170655 - DESCRIPTION Some vehicles may exhibit one or more of the following noises from the front suspension: 1. A creaking noise from under the front of the vehicle (front lower arm bushing) when driving over bumps at approximate 12 - 25 mph (20 - 40 Km/h). The noise occurs when the road surface is wet or after the vehicle has been washed. The noise becomes more noticeable as the bumps get higher. The creaking noise is caused by the front lower arm bushing (A) making a stick-slip noise during wet road conditions. 2. A clunking noise from the front coil spring when driving over bumps. The clunking noise is due to stick- slip between the front strut bearing (B) and the coil spring (C). 3. A popping noise from the bump stopper (D) when driving through gutters.",
