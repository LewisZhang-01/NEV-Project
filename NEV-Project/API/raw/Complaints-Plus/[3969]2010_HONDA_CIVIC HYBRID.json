THE RADIO WAS A ONE TIME EVENT.  AND LASTLY, THE BRAKE LIGHT HAS BEEN RANDOMLY AND CONTINUOUSLY CAME ON AND OFF ON THE INSTRUMENTAL PANEL WHILE I'M DRIVING AS THOUGH I HAD LEFT THE PARKING BRAKE ON.  THIS USED TO HAPPEN MORE WHEN I'M MAKING A TURN OR ACCELERATING ON CITY STREETS, BUT LATELY, THE LIGHT HAS BEEN COMING ON/OFF NO MATTER IF I'M TURNING OR GOING STRAIGHT OR ON A HIGHWAY OR CITY STREET.

THIS IS NOT THE INDICATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DASH BOARD THAT LIGHTS WHEN WEIGHT IS DETECTED UNDER 65 LBS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, WHICH APPROPRIATELY DEACTIVATES THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.  THIS IS AN INDICATOR LIGHT IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER SHOWING 'SIDE AIRBAG OFF', THAT HAS TURNED ON 3 TIMES IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS, ONLY FOR MAYBE 5-10 SECONDS EACH TIME.  FIRST NOTICED ON CHRISTMAS DAY GOING AROUND 20MPH, THE LIGHT TURNED ON FOR MAYBE 5 SECONDS, THEN TURNED OFF.  LATEST OCCURRENCE WAS LAST WEEKEND, WHILE SITTING AT THE ATM MACHINE.  BOTH TIMES I HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE, THEY RUN DIAGNOSTICS ON IT, AND THERE ARE NO CODES LOGGED TO INDICATE AN ERROR CONDITION, AND OF COURSE, BEING THAT IT IS SO SPORADIC, THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE THE CONDITION.     THIS IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE A CHILD THAT I WANT TO BE PROTECTED BY ANY AND ALL NECESSARY AIRBAGS IF IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT I/WE ARE IN AN ACCIDENT. SO WHICH ONE OF THE 'SIDE' AIRBAG IS NOT WORKING WHEN THAT INDICATOR LIGHTS? ONE? ALL?  THE NUMBER OF AIRBAGS THIS CAR HAS, WAS A DEAL-MAKING SELLING POINT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.

AFTER CHECKING OVER THE INTERNAL CONTROLS TO MAKE SURE SHE DIDN'T HAVE A WRONG SETTING, SHE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION AND FOUND THAT THE CONDENSER HAD A HOLE IN IT APPARENTLY FROM A FOREIGN OBJECT (ROCK). UPON FURTHER INTERNET RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THIS SITUATION WAS NOT A RARE OCCURRENCE.  THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS LISTED ON THE INTERNET OF THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I CONTACTED BOTH AMERICAN HONDA AS WELL AS THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED AND WAS TOLD THAT HONDA WOULD NOT COVER THIS UNDER WARRANTY. THE ISSUE IS DESIGN OR MATERIAL WORKMANSHIP RELATED, NOT AN \"ACT OF GOD\" OR UNLUCKY CIRCUMSTANCE. THE CONDENSER IS NOT WELL PROTECTED AS IN OTHER COMPETITIVE VEHICLES, SO IT IS MORE PRONE TO THIS ISSUE. OTHER PEOPLE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE ON AN INTERNET \"FORUM\" ARE FINDING CREATIVE WAYS TO PROTECT THE CONDENSER WITH A WIRE \"NETTING\" BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT JUST BY REPLACING THE CONDENSER DOES NOT FIX THE ROOT CAUSE.  SINCE THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, HONDA IS MOST LIKELY NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THIS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. AT THIS POINT, I'LL HAVE TO ASK MY INSURANCE TO GET INVOLVED AND PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE AND POTENTIALLY HAVE MY INSURANCE RATES INCREASE IF THIS RE-OCCURS.

THIS OCCURS IN ALL HEADREST POSITIONS, BUT IS WORSE WHEN ADJUSTED RIGHT BEHIND MY HEAD.  I HAVE TILTED THE SEAT BACK AS FAR AS I SAFELY CAN AND STILL BE ABLE TO DRIVE.   I AM 53 YEAR OLD FEMALE, 5'3\" TALL, AND WEAR BIFOCALS. I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY FOCUSING FROM TACHOMETER TO SPEEDOMETER TO ROAD BECAUSE I CANNOT MOVED MY HEAD TO USE THE RIGHT PART OF MY GLASSES TO SEE.  I CANNOT TILT MY HEAD BACK AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE HEADREST.  I ALSO EXPERIENCED A HEADACHE THAT EVENING AS WELL DUE TO EYE STRAIN.    THE NHTSA CHANGED THEIR HEADREST REGULATIONS IN 2008.  TEST DUMMIES FOR LARGE MALES WERE USED AND THEN STANDARDS WERE PUT IN PLACE.  AFTER SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON A NEW CAR, I AM UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE IT.  I HAVE TO EITHER REMOVE, TURN AROUND, OR JERRY-RIG A REMEDY FOR THE HEADREST IN ORDER TO DRIVE AND NOT SUFFER NECK, BACK, SHOULDER AND VISUAL PAIN.  THE COST IS MY SAFETY IN AN ACCIDENT.  OR, I CAN LEAVE THE HEADREST AND DRIVE WITH MY POSTURE IN A HORRID POSITION. I CANNOT SIT UP STRAIGHT, MY HEAD IS FORCED DOWNWARD SO I CANNOT USE MY BIFOCALS PROPERLY, AND I CANNOT TILT THE SEAT BACK ANY FURTHER AND STILL SEE OVER THE DASHBOARD.    THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ALL OVER THE INTERNET, SPECIFICALLY FOR HONDA ACCORDS AND CIVICS, AS WELL AS NISSANS, MERCEDES, FORDS AND OTHER MAKES.

THE STEERING REQUIRES ALMOST CONTINUOUS 'MICRO-CORRECTION.' ON THE HIGHWAY, AT 50 TO 60 MPH, THE CAR BEGINS TO DRIFT TO EITHER SIDE. TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL A TINY AMOUNT - SAY, 1/8 TO  OF AN INCH - CAUSES THE CAR TO DRIFT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TURN MORE THAN EXPECTED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT A RAPID 'RE-CORRECTION' (TINY TURN OF THE WHEEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION) IS REQUIRED TO PREVENT IT FROM ENTERING THE ADJACENT LANE. AND THIS, OF COURSE, LEADS TO A 'RE-RE RECORRECTION', AND A 'RE-RE-RE-CORRECTION', ETC. ON THE OFF-RAMP, AT REDUCED SPEED, TRYING TO DRIVE ALONG THE SMOOTH CURVE REQUIRES MICRO-CORRECTION, HOWEVER THE RESULTING DRIVING PATTERN IS A SERIES OF NEAR-STRAIGHT LINES AND SHARP ANGLES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  *TW",
