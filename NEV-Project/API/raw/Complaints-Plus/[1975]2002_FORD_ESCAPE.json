I WAS CONCERNED AND HAD PLANS TO DRIVE IT TO THE AUTO SHOP LATER THAT DAY. WHEN TURNING LEFT OUT OF A PARKING LOT IN TOWN, HEADING TO THE SHOP, I NOTICED WHEN I WENT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE WHEEL THE STEERING WHEEL WAS A COMPLETE 90 DEGREES OFF FROM NORMAL ONCE I GOT THE VEHICLE GOING STRAIGHT. IT DID NOT FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE AND I HAD IT TOWED INTO THE AUTO SHOP. AFTER INSPECTION IT WAS FOUND TO BE A ROTTED OUT AND CRACKED SUB FRAME. FORD DID A RECALL ON THIS SPECIFIC PART IN 2014 DUE TO MAJOR CORROSION ISSUES WITH THE 2001-2004 MODELS. THIS VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN FOR THE RECALL, HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE PART THEY DECIDED IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO DRILL A HOLE IN THE CORRODED PART AND INSTALL A BRACKET  ACROSS THE WHOLE SUB FRAME. I DON'T SEE HOW WEAKENING A CORRODED PART WITH A HOLE BEING DRILLED IN IT IS ANY SOLUTION. I AM NOT ALONE THINKING THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT FORD IS COMPLETELY IGNORING. IF THE SUB FRAME HAD FAILED WHEN I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY INSTEAD OF EXITING THE PARKING LOT I COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED AS THE SUB FRAME HOLDS THE WHEEL AND STEERING MECHANISM TOGETHER.

HER FRONT TIRE WAS COMPLETELY BALD AFTER THIS INCIDENT. (TREAD WAS GOOD BEFORE). I CALLED FORD AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE & REPORTED THE INCIDENT. THE REP TOLD ME THAT IN ORDER FOR A REPAIR THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED TO A FORD DEALER & TO KEEP THE TOW BILL AS THEY WOULD COVER IT. RIGHT NOW THE SUV IS AT THE DEALER. IT HAS BEEN 2 DAYS SINCE THEY'VE HAD IT & I'VE HEARD NOTHING. I AM GETTING VERY IMPATIENT. BECAUSE IT'S A RECALL I HAVE A HUNCH THEY PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER. THIS VEHICLE IS HER ONLY WAY TO SCHOOL & WORK. I ASKED ABOUT A LOANER & THEY EXPLAINED THAT BECAUSE OF THE HUGE VOLUME OF RECALLS, A LOANER WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COME BY.

THE LIGHT CONTINUED TO GO ON AND SO I FINALLY BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 15, 2003.

I AM THANKFUL THAT THIS HAPPENED AT A VERY SLOW SPEED AND FEAR THAT IF OTHER FOLKS HAVE THIS HAPPEN AT HIGHWAY SPEED IT COULD BE A VERY BAD OUTCOME !  THIS ALLOWED MY PASSENGER SIDE TIRE TO PULL OUTWARD HENCE PULLING THE CONTROL ARM LOOSE. IT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIX AND THE WARRANTY I HAD PURCHASED AT THE TIME OF BUYING THE VEHICLE WAS NO AVAIL. I CONTACTED FORD AND WAS TOLD THAT IF THERE IS NO RECALL THEN THERE IS NO PROBLEM !!  SORRY BUT IT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIX AND I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD MAKE GOOD ON THIS. HOW MANY INJURIES ARE REQUIRED BEFORE SOMEONE TAKES NOTICE ??  THE REPAIR BILL WAS $ 1160.96.    I HAD ONLY OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 7 MONTHS AT THAT TIME. IT STILL HAS MANY PAYMENTS TO BE MADE BEFORE IT IS PAID OFF.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE AIR CONDITIONING DRAIN RUNS DOWN THIS AREA CAUSING IT PERHAPS ?

I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I WENT OUT TO THE FORD FORUM AND THERE ARE ENTRIES FROM 2007 TO PRESENT WITH MANY 2002 ESCAPE OWNERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT I AM EXPERIENCING.  THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE MAJOR ENGINE PROBLEMS THAT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  NO ENGINE LIGHT HAS COME SINCE THE DPFE TUBES AND SENSOR AND VALVE WAS REPLACED.  *TR",

THE NEXT DAY, I WAS ABLE TO GET MY VEHICLE TO DEALER, WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED THE ABS MODULE HAS OVERHEATED AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I WAS GIVEN AN ESTIMATE OF $720.00 TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.

ON OR ABOUT JULY 1, 2011,  SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE FORD MOTOR CO.  REGARDING THIS REPAIR AT NO COST TO ME.

OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAVE MISSED SEVERAL OF THESE DANGEROUS COMPONENTS, OR THE WEBSITE IS INCORRECT.  I WAS UNABLE TO PHONE FORD, AS IT IS A WEEKEND AND WILL FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING.  MY ECU ON THIS VEHICLE WAS REPLACED AND PROGRAMMED AT A FORD DEALERSHIP IN COTTAGE GROVE, OR IN NOVEMBER OF 2009. IT WAS RETURNED TO ME WITH THE ABS LIGHT STILL ILLUMINATED.  THE DEALER MADE NO MENTION TO THE LIGHT AND I WRONGLY ASSUMED THAT IT WASN'T A PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE FORD MUST CORRECT THIS SITUATION FINANCIALLY AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL 2002 ESCAPES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  MANY COMPLAINTS I VIEWED WERE RECENT, SO I CONCLUDE THAT THE DANGEROUS SITUATION IS NOT REMEDIED.  *TW *TR",

THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP THAT SUPPOSEDLY DID THE RECALL IS NOW NO LONGER IN BUSINESS.

SO I TOOK MY CAR TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY A DEFECT IN THE MODULE. SO THEY CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO VERIFY THE CLAIM AND THEN FORD TURNS IT DOWN. THE REASON WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN 12 MONTHS SINCE RECALL WAS DONE. THEY SAID THAT PARTS AND LABOR ARE COVERED FOR ONLY 12 MONTHS. BUT I HAVE THE RECEIPT THAT SHOWS ALL  THE FIRST DEALERSHIP DONE WAS INSPECT AND APPLY GREASE. NO PARTS WERE REPLACED. IF THEY HAD ACTUALLY REPLACED THE MODULE THEN I COULD UNDERSTAND.  THE RECALL CAME OUT AFTER THE CAR WAS ALREADY 5 YEARS OLD. SO THE RECALL DIDN'T STATE ANYTHING ABOUT THE AGE OF THE PART AND I DON'T SEE HOW GREASE COULD FIX A 5 YEAR OLD PART.

WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON 2002 FORD ESCAPES WITH 3.0L V6 ENGINES FOR THE PCM ON DECELERATIONS BELOW 40 MPH BECAUSE OF FUEL-AIR MIXTURES BEING SENT TO THE ENGINE. IT WAS ISSUED IN APRIL OF 2004. I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY, MY DEALER THAT I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM, AND ANOTHER DEALER CLOSE TO ME; THEY ALL SAID THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON MY ESCAPE. I LOOKED IT UP MYSELF AND THEY WERE CORRECT, BUT IF THIS RECALL WAS ALREADY FIXED THEN IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT FIXED CORRECTLY BECAUSE THE EXACT DEFINIATION OF THE RECALL IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY ESCAPE. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I THINK FORD NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY EXCEPTION AND KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THE ENGINE NEEDS TO \"RE-PROGRAM\" ITSELF FOR A FEW WEEKS. IT IS A RECALL AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED FOR FREE, LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO MACQUIRE FORD AND WAS AGAIN DIAGNOSED WITH A FAILED NUMBER 1 IGNITION COIL.  THE COIL WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF $390.  THE TRUCK WAS PICKED UP FRIDAY, JUNE 2, DRIVEN HOME AND PARKED.  WHEN WE WENT TO DRIVE THE TRUCK AT 6PM THAT NIGHT, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE TRUCK RAN ROUGH.  THE DEALER WASN'T HAPPY TO SEE US BACK SATURDAY MORNING.  THIS TIME COIL NUMBER 3 HAD GONE.  NO ONE KNOWS WHY 5 COILS HAVE NOW FAILED AT THE COST OF $1300.  THE FINAL ORIGINAL COIL HAS ALSO BEEN REPLACED.  NO ONE AT FORD CAN GIVE AN ANSWER AND I AM OUT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND I SOMEHOW DOUBT THIS PROBLEM WILL BE RESOLVED.  *NM",

INSTEAD, IT STUCK AT NEARLY 80 MPH. NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO RELEASE THE SPEED, EVEN APPLYING MAXIMUM BRAKING PRESSURE,  HAD NO EFFECT. LINDA TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND COASTED TO A STOP AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER NEGOTIATING A CURVE THAT COULD EASILY HAVE CAUSED A ROLL-OVER. LINDA TRIED RESTARTING THE MOTOR, BUT IT WAS STILL RACING, AND THE TACHOMETER REACHED 5000 RPMS.  3) FORTUNATELY, ANOTHER MOTORIST WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH AUTOMOBILES, STOPPED TO GIVE ASSISTANCE. HE DISCONNECTED THE CRUISE CONTROL. THIS ALLOWED THE MOTOR TO RETURN TO NORMAL SPEED, AND LINDA WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE AND COMPLETE HER TRIP HOME. THE ASSISTING MOTORIST DID INDICATE THAT THE CABLE TO THE CRUISE CONTROL SEEMED TO BE LOOSE.  UPON CHECKING VARIOUS WEB-SITES,INCLUDING THE NHTSA SITE, I FOUND THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED IN 2004 FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM (NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER : 04V574000). I CALLED THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY RECALL INFORMATION SITE (1-866-436-7332) BUT  WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF WHERE MY ESCAPE WAS MANUFACTURED, IT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR FREE REPAIR.

WHEN I CONTACTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE SUV, I EXPRESSED TO THEM MY DISPLEASURE IN HAVING TRANSMISSION TROUBLE AT ONLY 35,000+ MILES AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL TO NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AT THAT ODOMETER READING, AND, INDEED, THEY HAD REPLACED TRANSMISSIONS AS EARLY AS 12,000 MILES.

AFTER HAVING THE CAR TOWED TO A TRANSMISSION FACILITY IN INDIANAPOLIS, I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM DID NOT ORIGINATE IN THE TRANSMISSION, BUT WAS THE RESULT OF A GROUND CIRCUIT PROBLEM.

WE PULLED INTO PARKING PLACE, FOOT ON BRAKE TO STOP AND CAR SUDDENLY ACCELLERATED AND WE ALMOST WENT INTO THE RESTAURANT WINDOW.  MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO HOLD THE CAR BACK BY USING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE.  HE THEN REACHED DOWN AND TURNED THE KEY OFF.  WE HAVE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE ON 4 SEPARTE OCCASSIONS AND HAD THE CAR IN THE GARAGE ON 6 OCCASSIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS 4 WEEKS AGO.  I WAS DRIVING.  I PULLED INTO A PARKING PLACE, HAD MY HAND ON THE GEAR SHIFT TO PUT INTO PARK WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELLERATED.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE AS MY HUSBAND AND WENT INTO A PLATE GLASS WINDOW OF A RESTAURANT THAT FORTUNATELY WAS NOT OPEN AND BEING REMODELED.  I DID $4,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO THE CAR AND THE RESTAURANT IS CLAIMING $30,000 DAMAGE TO THEIR BUILDING.   AGAIN WE HAD IT IN THE GARAGE.  THEY CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  IT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOUR FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE.  WE HAVE HEARD FROM FORD THAT THEY CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.   WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AS SOONER OR LATER, WHEN IT HAPPENS, SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT.  WE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A CAR THAT WORKS PROPERLY.  OTHER TIMES WHEN DRIVING ALONG IT WOULD ACCELLERATE ON ITS OWN BUT THEN CUT BACK.   MOST OFTEN WHEN YOUR FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE FOR SOME REASON.  FORD GARAGE CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG AND FORD CO.

THE SUPPOSED TSB INCLUDED REPLACEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY, AIR CHARGE BODY, MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR, AIR CHARGE SENSOR GASKET, POWER RELAY FOR PCM, EGR SENSOR, AND THE PURGE REGULATION VALVE FOR VAPOR SYSTEM.  I SEARCHED THE NHTSA TSB SITE FOR THE BULLETIN AND COULDN'T FIND IT.  THE NUMBER WE WERE GIVEN WAS TSB 02-23-01.  I NOTICED THAT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM BY THE NHTSA WAS CLOSED AND REOPENED IN SEP 2002.

ON JULY 20, 2002, I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO LOS ANGELES FOR A FAMILY REUNION WITH FOUR SMALL CHILDREN IN THE CAR WHICH INCLUDED MY TWO DAUGHTERS, MY NEICE AND MY NEPHEW.  GOING AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 65 MILES PER HOUR, THE ENGINE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND ALL ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE SHUT DOWN INCLUDING THE POWER STEERING AND THE BRAKES.  I HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE CAR IS NOW SITTING AT MAGIC FORD IN VALENCIA, CA WHERE I HAD IT TOWED.  FORD HAS REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL CAR THAT I AM FORCED TO DRIVE.  FORD HAS NOT BOTHERED TO CONTACT ME.

I COASTED TO A STOP AND TURNED OFF THE HEATER, RADIO, AND IGNITION AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK.  IR STARTED AGAIN BUT I WAS CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO WILLIAMS FORD(739 FRONT ST. P.O. BOX 220, BEREA,OH 44017) ON MONDAY JAN 29, 2002 TO REPORT THE ENGINE FAILURE.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND TOLD ME THAT \"THE CAR JUST BURPED\".  I ASKED IF THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN AND HE TOLD ME THAT \"THE CAR JUST HAD TO LEARN THE WAY I DRIVE\".  I QUESTIONED HOW AN INANIMATE OBJECT WITHOUT A BRAIN COULD LEARN.  HE TOLD ME \"OH YES, IT DOES HAVE A BRAIN\".  I CALLED ANOTHER SERVICE ADVISOR (ED)  AT WILLIAMS FORD ON TUESDAY JAN 30 TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION.  HE TOO ASSURED ME THAT \"THE CAR JUST SORT OF HICCUPPED\".  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE CAR WAS LEARNING THE WAY I DROVE. WHEN I ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN HE SAID IT WAS TERMED \"ADAPTIVE IDLE STRATEGY\" AND THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NEW.  I TOLD HIM I HAVE HAD OTHER NEW CARS THAT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO AND ASKED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE.  HE SAID THE COMPUTER WAS ADJUSTING TO THE WAY I ACCERLATE AND DECELERATE AND THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING I SHOULD DO.  I HAVE SINCE READ THAT THE NHTSA IS INVESTIGATING OTHER FORD ESCAPES THAT THE ENGINES HAVE STALLED WHILE DRIVING AND HAVE NEEDED TO HAVE THE ENGINES REPAIRED/REPLACED.  I AM DISSAPPOINTED THAT THEY DID NOT CARE ENOUGH TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK ON THE CAR TO ASSURE ME OF THE CAR'S SAFETY AND REPAIR/REPLACE THE ENGINE IF NEEDED.*AK",
