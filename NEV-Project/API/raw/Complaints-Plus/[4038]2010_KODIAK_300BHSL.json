I HAVE A PICTURE OF WHAT WE SAW AFTER PULLING INTO THE REST STOP.  THERE ARE VISIBLE RUB MARKS ON THE TIRE FROM THE BRACKET AND WE WERE GLAD THAT WE STOPPED WHEN WE DID TO AVOID A POSSIBLE TIRE FAILURE.  THE WIRING AND BRACKET ON THIS SLIDE OUT IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED LIKE THEY ARE ON OTHER RV'S.  *TR",
