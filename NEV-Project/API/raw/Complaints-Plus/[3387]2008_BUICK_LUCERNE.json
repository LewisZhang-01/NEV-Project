I had had intermittent problems with it as it went out, and it didn't throw a code showing what the problem was.  (I took it to AAMCO once and Goodyear twice before they could identify the problem.)  (Some Buick dealers do not work on cars over 10 years, and some do not use off-market parts when GM has chosen to stop making replacement parts, such as the rack and pinion/steering gear.  Their goal is to sell cars, not maintain.)  At 150,000+ miles, sensors go out, and I expect to replace them.  What I don't expect is deliberate design that will cause the vehicle to be or cause damage(d).  This is a design flaw by GM and I wonder how many mystery crashes can be related to this.",

So I replaced it and it fixed the problem for a few days. I was driving home from work and the car shut off. I could smell plastic burning. I pulled over and pulled the fuse box cover off which is located under the rear seat and I pulled the relay out and burned my fingers in the process. So something is wrong and it's causing the relay to overheat and melt. There are many people according to carcomplaints.com that have the same issue. I've seen a lot of people saying that GM says that the seat bracket touches the fuse box putting pressure on the relay causing this problem. Well after I replaced the relay I did not put the rear seat on and it still burned out. In my mind it seems to be a fire safety hazard. No check engine lights came on either.",

MY DAUGHTER TRIED TO ACCELERATE AND NOTHING HAPPENED; SHE THEN TRIED TO BRAKE TO PULL OVER AND WAS UNABLE TO FREELY TURN THE WHEEL.  SHE STRUGGLED TO MOVE TO SAFETY TO THE SHOULDER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT THEN FELT THE STEERING WHEEL AND BRAKES LOCK COMPLETELY AS THE CAR STALLED.  WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE CAR TO MOVE TO SAFETY, THE CAR VIOLENTLY SHOOK.  SINCE THE CAR WAS STILL PARTIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY, MY HUSBAND AND I CALLED THE CT STATE POLICE TO REQUEST HELP WHILE MY DAUGHTERS WERE WAITING FOR AAA.  WHEN THE TROOPER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE HE CALLED US TO SAY THAT THE CAR WAS PARTIALLY IN THE ROAD AND THAT TWO CRUISERS WERE THERE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR DAUGHTERS. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO OUR SERVICE STATION OF 25 YEARS IN SCRANTON PA AND FOUND THAT THE FUEL PUMP RELAY POST HAD OVERHEATED AND MELTED.  A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DID NOT REVEAL ANY PROBLEMS EITHER. THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED ONE WEEK EARLIER TO THIS SAME STATION BECAUSE THE CAR WAS SHAKING VIOLENTLY.  AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC TEST REVEALED NOTHING, THEY DETERMINED THAT THE CAR WAS LOW ON FUEL (AND THAT IT WASN'T A FUEL PUMP ISSUE).  WE THEN DROVE THE CAR ANOTHER 517 MILES WITHOUT INCIDENT.  I HAVE FOUND THAT COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH BUICK (I HAVE FILED ONE TOO) REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THAT FIRES HAVE RESULTED FROM THE OVERHEATING.  THESE COMPLAINTS INDICATE THAT SOMETIMES THE CAR STARTS, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.  I BELIEVE THESE 2 INCIDENTS, ONE WEEK APART, WERE RELATED AND THAT BOTH TIMES, NO WARNING OR DIAGNOSTIC TEST REVEALED A PROBLEM.  IF MY DAUGHTER HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE 4 LANE HIGHWAY LEADING INTO HARTFORD AND THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE AND MY OTHER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A SERIOUS, IF NOT FATAL ACCIDENT.  *TR",

THEY NEVER FIXED OR REPLACED  ANYTHING BUT A WATER PUMP AND A COUPLE OF ELECTRICAL BULBS (THE SAME ONES).
