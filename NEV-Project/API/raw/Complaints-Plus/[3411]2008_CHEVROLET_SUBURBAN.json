THEY ALSO STATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT EVEN SELL OUR VEHICLE ON THEIR LOT IF WE TRADED IT IN.  I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN, AND I KNOW 4 PEOPLE WHO HAD THIS SAME ISSUE, AND HAD TO BUY NEW VEHICLES BECAUSE CHEVY DID NOT OFFER A SOLUTION.  THE REPAIRS COST APPROXIMATELY $5000.  OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO TRADE IT IN OR PAY THE REPAIRS OUT OF POCKET.  THIS IS A BAD DESIGN BY CHEVY, AND A SAFETY ISSUE.  WE CANNOT DRIVE OUR VEHICLE AT THIS TIME.  WHEN THE ISSUE BEGAN IN OCTOBER OF 2016 WE WERE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND IT STARTED MAKING A KNOCKING NOISE.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP IN FOLEY ALABAMA, (SOUTHERN CHEVROLET) AND WERE TOLD BY THEM IT IS A BAD DESIGN, AND THEY HAVE SEEN MANY TRUCKS WITH THE SAME ISSUE.  THEY DIAGNOSED AND GAVE US THE OPTION OF REPLACING THE CAM AND LIFTERS FOR $5000.  WE DID NOT DO THIS AT THE TIME, AND TOOK IT TO ANOTHER MECHANIC WHO STATED HE HAD SEEN THIS ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES HIMSELF.  HE GAVE US A TEMPORARY FIX, AND WE DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME.  WE TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP WHO TOLD US THE EXACT SAME THING.  *TR",

THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME AND I QUOTE \"IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HOT DAY AND YOU TOOK THE CAR THROUGH A CAR WASH WARPING THE ROTORS.\" IF GM IS MAKING THEIR ROTORS WITH NON-VIRGIN STEEL THIS CAN HAPPEN.

THE LOCKS DO NOT WORK AT ALL WITH THE KEYLESS ENTRY NOR THE MAIN LOCK BUTTON FROM THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE LOCK ACTUATORS MALFUNCTIONING AND THAT IT IS ALSO A WELL KNOWN ISSUE FROM VARIOUS DEALERS AND PER MY RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET.
