THIS BRAKE LINE TUBING IS OF INFERIOR METAL COMPOSITION PRONE TO RUSTING IN NORTHERN CLIMATES WHERE WINTER SALT IS SPREAD ON ROAD SURFACES.

WHEN CAR WAS RESTARTED AFTER A SHORT DURATION OF BEING PARKED, UPON PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL, ALL BRAKE FLUID SQUIRTED ONTO PAVEMENT.

I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CLASS ACTION SUIT AND CAN ONLY FIND THE RECALL ON THE LOWER CONTROL ARM THAT APPARENTLY DOES NOT INCLUDE MY SPECIFIC VIN NUMBER (AND A LOT OF OTHERS APPARENTLY AS WELL).  I HAVE ASKED SEVERAL MECHANICS AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS AND SUSPECT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT IT IS PRETTY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A CONTROL ARM GO OUT SO SOON IN A VEHICLES LIFE.

MY HUSBAND CALL THE LOCAL LINCOLN DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.

SINCE THE COOLANT RESERVOIR WAS STILL OVER HALF FULL, I DROVE DOWNHILL GOING ONLY 25MPH, TO A POPULATED AREA APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES AWAY WHERE I COULD RECEIVE ASSISTANCE.  I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD TO BE TOWED 75 MILES TO THE LINCOLN DEALERSHIP IN LAS VEGAS, NV.  I LEFT THE CAR, AND WAS LATER INFORMED THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD HAD FAILED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I PICKED UP THE CAR THE NEXT DAY, ONLY DROVE A FEW MILES AND REALIZED SOMETHING WAS STILL WRONG, SO I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED THE CAR TO DESERT LINCOLN-MERCURY.  THEY TOOK IT BACK INTO THE SHOP TO LOOK IT OVER...RETURNING IT AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  THEY SAID THAT COOLANT HAD LEAKED INTO THE SPARK PLUG SOCKETS AND THEY HAD TO REMOVE THEM AND BLOW OUT THE FLUID.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLDS ON 97 LINCOLNS FAILED QUITE OFTEN AND HE FIGURED THAT EVENTUALLY FORD WOULD HAVE TO RECALL THEM.  I WAS SENT OFF AGAIN WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT MY VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED.  TWO DAYS LATER I TRIED TO START THE CAR AND IT WOULDN'T START WITHOUT REPEATED EFFORTS.  I CALLED LINCOLN AND THEY TOLD ME TO DRIVE THE CAR BACK TO LAS VEGAS...APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES AWAY.  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT THE CYLINDERS WERE WARPED FROM THE COOLANT AND THAT I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE.  I AM FURIOUS THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY KNOWINGLY LEAVES PARTS ON THEIR VEHICLES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY FAULTY.  THE INTAKE MANIFOLDS ON SOME 97 LINCOLN TOWN CARS HAVE BEEN RECALLED, BUT APPARENTLY NOT ON THOSE WITH OUR PARTICULAR VIN NUMBER.  THE DEFECTIVE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS PLASTIC AND THE NEW ONES ARE METAL.  WHICH AGAIN SHOWS THAT FORD KNOWS THE PART IS THE DEFECTIVE AND WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS.

THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TO AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ENGINE AS THIS. HE HAD HIS REPLACED AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I SAVED A $125.00 BY HAVING MINE REPLACED AT MY LOCAL GARAGE. HIS COSTS WAS AROUND $550. IT WAS REPLACED WITH ANOTHER PLASTIC INTAKE AND THE FORD PARTS PERSONNEL SAID IT WAS A STRONGER ONE. MY BET IS, THAT IT WILL NOT HOLD UP TO THE INTENSE HEAT AND VIBRATION ANY BETTER. THIS IS A VERY POOR USE OF PLASTIC, EVERYONE KNOWS ANY KIND OF PLASTIC DEGRADES UNDER HEAT AND BECOMES BRITTLE OVER TIME. I SUSPECT THERE ARE MANY FAILURES OUT THERE OR SOON WILL BE, ESPECIALLY SINCE FORD CALLED THE POLICE CARS BACK IN AND CHANGED THEM OUT. THEY WOULD INCUR THE MOST MILEAGE AND SHOW THE PROBLEMS THE QUICKEST,JUST BY THEIR NORMAL USE. I REALIZE THAT THE POLICE USE CROWN VICTORIAS BUT THEY HAD THE SAME 4.6 ENGINE AND INTAKE SETUP. LIKE I HAVE WRITTEN, I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH MY DAD'S INFORMATION AS SOON AS I CAN GET HIM TO RETREIVE IT, HE LIVES IN W.V  AND HAS TALKED TO THE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP THERE, BUT STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT HIMSELF.
