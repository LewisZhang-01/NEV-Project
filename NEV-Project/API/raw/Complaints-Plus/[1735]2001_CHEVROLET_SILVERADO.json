SO I STARTED TO TRY AND SLOW DOWN THE TRUCK BY DOWNSHIFTING TO A LOWER GEAR AND WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN A FEW MILES PER HOUR BUT NOT NEAR ENOUGH. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A CURVE NOT LONG AFTER THE BRAKES STARTED FAILING. NOT TO FAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS STOPPED TRAFFIC. I TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO STOP BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. I ONLY SLOWED DOWN TO 45 MPH BEFORE I WAS ABOUT TO HIT THE BACK OF A CAR HEAD ON. SO I DID THE ONLY OTHER THING I COULD TO MAYBE MAKE IT OUT WITHOUT A FATAL CRASH. I WENT OFF THE ROAD AROUND THE CAR AND HIT THE PARKING BRAKE AND NOTHING HAPPENED BECAUSE IT FAILED AS WELL. SO I TURNED THE TRUCK REAL SHARP TO DODGE THE TREES AND SLID SIDEWAYS FOR A WHILE AND THE TRUCK FINALLY CAME TO A STOP AND I WAS SO SICK I HAD A BAD PANIC ATTACK AND STARTED THROWING UP AND MY HEART FELT LIKE IT WAS BEING HIT BY A HAMMER AND MY BODY HURT SO BAD FROM THE TRUCK COMING TO A STOP AND ME SLAMMING INTO THE ARM REST AND THE SEAT BELT CUT MY NECK STOMACH AND CHEST. I GOT OUT AND LOOKED AT MY TRUCK AND NOTICED I HIT A PILE OF LOGS AND DAMAGED  MY TIRES AND THE BODY OF MY TRUCK IN THE SEVERAL PLACES. THEN I TOOK IT TO A AUTO SHOP AND THEY FOUND OUT CHEVY DIDN'T PUT ANY CORROSIVE PROTECTION UNDER THE TRUCK OR ON PARTS. THE BRAKE LINES HAD BLEW OUT CAUSE OF THE RUST. ALL THE BRAKE LINES WERE SHOT ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER BRAKE PARTS AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE TRUCK AND OUTSIDE THE TRUCK IS SOLID RUST. I COULD HAVE GOT KILLED IF I DIDN'T REACT WELL. NOW I PAY FOR A TRUCK I CAN'T DRIVE.    *TR",

THERE WAS NO WARNING OF A LOSS IN HYDRAULIC PRESSURE AND NO OTHER INDICATIONS OF AN IMMINENT BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE.  IMMEDIATELY UPON NOTICING THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE I DOWNSHIFTED THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TO HELP SLOW THE TRUCK DOWN.  LUCKILY THERE WAS NO OTHER TRAFFIC AS I ROLLED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WITH A 3,000 POUND BOAT/TRAILER LOAD I WAS TOWING.    I MANAGED TO MAKE IT HOME BY ALTERING MY ROUTE TO AVOID DOWNSLOPING INTERSECTIONS AND ALSO DOWNSHIFTING THE TRANSMISSION TO SLOW DOWN AS I APPROACHED THOSE INTERSECTIONS I COULD NOT AVOID.  SINCE I DID NOT HAVE A VEHICLE LIFT OR THE PROPER TOOLS/EQUIPMENT TO MAKE THE REPAIRS, I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO AN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR FACILITY.  THEIR DIAGNOSIS: BRAKE LINE FAILURE DUE TO SIGNIFICANT CORROSION.  REPAIR BILL WAS $260 TO REPAIR/REPLACE THE CORRODED BRAKE LINE THAT SUPPLIED THE BRAKES TO THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL!    THIS SAME CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED AGAIN ON 9/3/12 (I.E., SAME LOSS OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE (WITHOUT WARNING) & TOTAL BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE)!  THE TRUCK IS AGAIN IN THE REPAIR SHOP AND THE MECHANIC STATED THE BRAKE LINE TO THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL FAILED DUE TO CORROSION & HE ALSO SAID ALL THE OTHER BRAKE LINES, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE REPLACED ON 6/22/2012, ARE CORRODED \"PRETTY BAD.\"  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE DESIGN & LOCATION OF THE BRAKE SYSTEMS ON THESE CHEVROLET & GMC SILVERADO PICKUP TRUCKS IS SUCH THAT CORROSION AND BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE IS A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE, ESPECIALLY IN OUR REGION (UPPER MICHIGAN) WITH LONG WINTERS AND ROAD SALT.

AT APPROXIMATELY 22,000 MILES THE BACK ROTORS AND BRAKES WERE REPLACED THEN AT ABOUT 32,000 MILES THE FRONT ROTORS AND BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED, AND THEN LAST SUMMER THE BACK BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED  AND THE ROTORS WERE TURNED. ALSO SOMETIME WITHIN 30,000 - 45,000 MILES ALL THE BRAKE LINES HAD TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS TWO DIFFERENT ALTERNATORS AND A WINDOW MOTOR.   TODAY (APRIL 20,2012) MY WIFE AND I WERE GOING TO TOWN TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT, WHEN AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE PULLED ONTO A STREET THAT WE WERE ON BUT WAS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN AND PULL OVER AND WHEN I DID THE BRAKES WENT TO THE FLOOR. LUCKILY I HAD ROOM TO MOVE THE TRUCK TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND AFTER SOME DISTANCE WE GOT STOPPED. WE NURSED THE TRUCK HOME AND ITS SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY AGAIN WITH SOME TYPE OF A BRAKE PROBLEM.I THINK THAT I HAVE REPORTED THIS BEFORE BUT A TRUCK THAT IS BABIED AND TREATED LIKE MINE WITH ONLY 57,000 MILES ON IT THAT HAS TO HAVE THREE SETS OF BRAKES (NOT COUNTING THE ORIGINAL), ALL THE BRAKE LINES COMPLETELY REPLACED BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLETELY RUSTED AWAY. ROTORS REPLACED FRONT AND REAR AND ROTORS REPLACED AND TURNED A SECOND TIME, AND NOW SOMETHING BRAKE RELATED BROKEN AGAIN SHOULD GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. THESE TRUCKS AREN'T SAFE, AND NO ONE BUYS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR LACK OF DRIVING EXCUSES.

AT APPROXIMATELY 20,000 MILES I HAD TO REPLACE BOTH REAR ROTORS AND BRAKES, THEN AT APPROXIMATELY 36,400 MILES I HAD TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT ROTORS, BRAKES AND THE ALTERNATOR. AT APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES THE DRIVERS DOOR POWER WINDOW MOTOR HAD TO BE REPLACED AND ALL THE BRAKE LINES AND SPEED SENSORS ON THE TRUCK HAD TO BE REPLACED. NOW WITH 50,300 MILES, THE TRUCK IS SITTING IN MY DRIVE WAY NEEDING ANOTHER ALTERNATOR AND THE REAR BRAKES / ROTORS ARE WORN OUT AGAIN. SINCE I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK I HAVE ALREADY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $2800 ON BRAKES, BRAKE LINES, WHEEL / SPEED SENSORS AND NEW ROTORS AND REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AND POWER DOOR MOTOR. THE TRUCK HAS STRANDED ME TWO TIMES WHEN THE BRAKES FAILED AND ONCE WHEN THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT. IT APPEARS THAT THE DEALERSHIPS AND GM KNOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS BUT JUST TRY TO GET THEM PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD. WHEN I HAD TO REPLACE THE FRONT ROTORS I OFFERED TO HAVE THE METAL / ROTORS ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHY THEY FAILED BUT GM WASN'T INTERESTED. THEY PAID HALF ON THAT REPAIR AND REQUESTED THAT I LEAVE THE ROTORS WITH THE DEALERSHIP. I WAS LUCKY BOTH TIMES WHEN THE BRAKES FAILED BECAUSE WE WERE GOING SLOW AND ON RURAL ROADS WITH MINIMAL TRAFFIC, THE OTHER TIME THE TRUCK STRANDED US WE  CAMPING ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT WHEN WE WERE ABOUT 10 MILES FROM THE CAMP. THESE  TRUCKS ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEMS ARE VERY DANGEROUS. I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A TECHNICAL REVIEW CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE MATERIALS USED FOR THE ROTORS AND THE BRAKE LINES. WHEN MY BRAKE LINES WERE REPLACED THEY CRUMBLED LIKE FLAKES OF RUST AND THE ROTORS BOTH FRONT AND BACK WERE DAMAGED FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE OVERHEATING. THERE WERE SURFACE STRESS FLAWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROTORS. I HAVE OWNED OTHER GM PRODUCTS, AND CURRENTLY HAVE A 1997 CHEVY TRUCK WITH NO BRAKE ISSUES. *TR",

SAME THING.  LUCKILY NO ONE IN FRONT.  AND RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING THE TRAILER AGAIN LOADED WITH HORSES THE LINE HAD RUSTED THRU AGAIN IN ANOTHER PLACE.   THE TRUCK HAS BEEN INTO MIDAS IN FRANKFORT KENTUCKY 2 TIMES TO REPAIR RUSTED BRAKE LINES.  THE OTHER TWO TIMES HAVE TAKEN TO A LOCAL MECHANIC.  EVERY MECHANIC COMMENTS ABOUT THE RUST ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE.  ALSO THE FACE PLACE FOR THE REAR AXEL THAT HOLDS THE OIL FOR THE REAR DRIVE HAS RUSTED THRU AND BEEN REPLACED ONCE BECAUSE THE LUBRICANT WAS LEAKING OUT OF IT.  THIS WAS DONE THRU A CHEVROLET DEALER TWO YEARS AGO.  THE PLATE IS AGAIN VERY RUSTED AND WHO KNOWS WHEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THE TRUCK IS NOT DRIVEN VERY MUCH ANYMORE SINCE IT IS NOT RELIABLE.  THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAT I HAVE IS TO REPLACE EVERY SINGLE BRAKE LINE WHICH IS TOO COSTLY FOR ME AT THIS TIME.  I BELIEVE WITH ALL THAT I HAVE READ THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM THAT CHEVY HAD WITH THEIR TRUCKS.  THE TRUCK IS SITTING IN THE DRIVE RIGHT NOW WITH THE MOST RECENT BRAKE LINE FAILURE.

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED A FEW DAYS LATER AND SAID THE MECHANIC HAD A ACCIDENT WITH THE TRUCK, HE WAS BRING IT INTO THE GARAGE AND HE HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THE CLOSED GARAGE DOORS BECAUSE OF A BRAKE FAILURE. THE DEALER AT THIS POINT CALLED GENERAL MOTORS AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES {NOT STOPPING & GOING THROUGH THE CLOSED DOORS}DAMAGE WAS DONE AND THEY HAD TO  REPLACE THE BUG DEFLECTOR,BUMPER CAP , FRONT GRILL & REPAIRED AND PAINTED THE HOOD. THEY ALSO REPLACED THE ~WHEEL SENSORS ~TELLING US THAT THIS WAS THE PROBLEM. WE HAD NO USE OF THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 6WK. THE TRUCK WAS RETURNED TO US WITHOUT CHARGE. WERE AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK NOW FEARING SOMEONE WILL BE INJURED  OR KILLED BECAUSE WE ARE NEVER SURE WHEN THIS BRAKE  FAILURE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. WE HAVE CALLED GM THEY MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A CHEVROLET DEALER BUT THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST TO CONFIRM THE BRAKE FAILURE . *TR",

IT WAS BUILT JUST AFTER THE RECALL DATE SO GM WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN OFFER TO CHARGE ME FOR THE REPAIR.   THE MAIN SAFETY PROBLEM IS THE SOFTWARE BUG THAT DOESN'T RECORD THE BAD CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR. THE FIRST 20 OR SO INCIDENTS WERE ANNOYING. WHEN THE TRUCK STARTED SHUTTING DOWN WHILE GOING DOWN A 10% GRADE ON A TWISTING MOUNTAIN ROAD IT GOT SCARY. LUCKILY I WASN'T PULLING THE 15000 POUND TRAILER THAT I OFTEN PULL.   THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS AT ONE PARTICULAR ENGINE TEMPERATURE AND IT DOESN'T SET A DTC. IT TOOK ME THREE MONTHS OF SEARCHING THE WEB TO FIND THE PROBLEM. GM WAS OF NO HELP DIAGNOSING OR FIXING THE PROBLEM EVEN WITH THE RECALL ON THE IDENTICAL TRUCKS THAT WERE BUILT JUST PRIOR TO MINE. MY TRUCK HAD THE POSITION SENSOR REPLACED IN 2002 WITH THE SAME DESIGN PART AS THE ORIGINAL. THE REPLACED PART LASTED TILL 2008.  SEARCHING THE WEB SHOWS THAT MOST OF THE 2000-2002 8.1L ENGINES DEVELOP THIS PROBLEM AT SOME POINT. GM MAKES A LOT OF MONEY SELLING UNNEEDED PARTS AND CHARGING $85 TO READ NON-EXISTENT DTCS.   AN 8.1L ENGINE IS MEANT TO PULL LARGE LOADS. WHEN THE ENGINE DIES THE TRUCK LOSES POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. MY TRUCK DIED AT LEAST 50 TIMES BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO FIX IT. I WOULDN'T LET MY WIFE DRIVE IT BECAUSE SHE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE KILLED SOMEONE WITH IT. IT DIED GOING AROUND THE SAME CORNER 5 DAYS IN A ROW. TURNING A 7000 POUND TRUCK WITHOUT POWER STEERING IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE.  I AM A TEST ENGINEER WITH 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE INTERNET THIS PROBLEM IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DIAGNOSE. GM IS OF NO HELP. THE PROBLEM SETS NO CODES AND THE VEHICLE RUNS FINE IF IT WARMS UP OR COOLS DOWN FROM THE ONE TEMPERATURE.  I REPLACED MY SENSOR AND THE VEHICLE NOW RUNS FINE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MORE VEHICLES OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL RE-OPEN YOUR INVESTIGATION. *TR",

THE FUEL GAUGE FLOATS AROUND AT RANDOM AND CAUSES THE LOW FUEL LIGHT TO COME ON EVEN WHEN THE TRUCK HAS A FULL TANK OF FUEL. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FUEL GAUGE IS NOT RELIABLE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IN THE TANK. IT OFTEN READS THAT THE TANK IS HALF FULL WHEN I KNOW THAT IT IS CLOSE TO EMPTY. THEREFORE, THIS POSES A DANGER GIVEN THAT THE DRIVER DOES NOT KNOW IF THE TRUCK HAS ENOUGH FUEL OR NOT TO REACH THE INTENDED DESTINATION. IN FACT IT COULD LEAVE MY WIFE OR I STRANDED ON THE ROAD AND POTENTIALLY IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE HAS THE SAME YEAR CHEVROLET SILVERADO TRUCK AND IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES. THEREFORE I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM TO BE WIDE SPREAD. I HAVE CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE REGARDING THIS MATTER AND THEY SUGGESTED TO HAVE IT CHECK BY A LOCAL DEALER. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A LOCAL DEALER ONLY TO LEARN THAT THE TRUCK HAS A BAD \"SENDING UNIT\" IN THE FUEL TANK. VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE BECAUSE OF IT'S LOCATION. AFTER FOLLOWING UP WITH GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE REGARDING THE KNOW PROBLEM THEY BOUNCED ME AROUND TO SEVERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. AFTER FINALLY GETTING SOMEONE ASSIGNED TO MY CASE, THEY CONTACTED ME ONCE VIA VOICE MAIL. AFTER WEEKS OF TRYING TO RETURN THERE CALL AND LEAVE THEM VOICE MAILS - I RECEIVED NO CALL BACKS. I EVEN CALLED THE GENERAL GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE LINE AND TOLD THE PERSON THAT ANSWERED TO PUT ME THROUGH TO THE PERSON ASSIGNED TO MY CASE, I WAS PROMPTLY TOLD THAT SHE WAS NOT AVAILABLE. LATER I RECEIVE AN E-MAIL FROM THEM TELLING ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REACH ME AND THAT MY TRUCK HAS 133,000 MILES AND IS OUT OF WARRANTY. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST ME. I AM A LOYAL GM CUSTOMER AND FEEL BETRAYED, AS THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT COULD RESULT IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION.

THE MECHANIC WHERE I TOOK THE VEHICLE EVEN SAID THAT HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I MADE IT THIS LONG.  HE EXPRESSED THAT HE HAS SEEN THE TRUCKS COME IN WITH AS LITTLE AS 20,000 MILES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ROTORS HAD RUSTED TOTALLY. IT IS OBVIOUS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ROTORS THAT COME FACTORY INSTALLED WITH ALL SILVERADO TRUCKS. ALSO I HAVE CONTACTED GM ABOUT THE ABS PROBLEM THAT I AM STILL HAVING AND HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. RIGHT WHEN THE TRUCK IS ABOUT TO STOP, THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES KICK IN AND THE TRUCK VEERS OFF TO THE RIGHT.  WHEN I TALKED TO GM THEY SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH MY TRUCK WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2001 AND HAS THE SAME BRAKE SYSTEM AS THE REGULAR SILVERADO, SINCE IT IS THE HD MODEL, IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. I DID HAVE A CASE NUMBER WITH THEM AND ALL THEY SAID IS THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT FIXED BEFORE I HAD AN ACCIDENT. THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEM, BUT WOULD NOT FIX IT UNDER THE RECALL.  NOW, $900 LATER, I HAVE A BRAND NEW SET OF BRAKES, BUT THE TRUCK STILL DOES NOT WANT TO STOP ONCE IT GETS UNDER 10 MPH. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME WHY THEY WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS SENT SOMETHING IN ABOUT THE 2500 HD MODEL, SO I HOPE THAT SOMETHING CAN NOW BE DONE.  I AM EVEN WILLING TO LET ONE OF YOUR TECHNICIANS COME OUT AND TEST DRIVE MY VEHICLE PERSONALLY TO SHOW THAT IT IS DOING THE SAME THING AS THE RECALL FOR THE REGULAR 1500 MODELS.  THE ONLY WAY I HAVE FOUND TO STOP THE BRAKE FAILURE IS TO PULL THE FUSE FOR THE WHOLE ABS SYSTEM, BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO STARE AT THE RED LIGHT ON THE DASH CLUSTER ALL THE TIME, PLUS YOU DO NOT HAVE ABS IF YOU NEED IT.

WE TOOK OUR TRUCK TO A CHEVY DEALER AND THEY INFORMED US IT WAS OUR RIGHT FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSOR AND THE HUB ASSEMBLY.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE IT IN THE SHOP AND WILL BE GETTING THE OLD PARTS WHEN WE PICK UP THE TRUCK.  THANK GOODNESS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT INTO THE SHOP BEFORE WE WERE INJURED IN AN ACCIDENT  LIKE SO MANY OTHERS OR WE INJURED SOMEONE ELSE.  I  AM VERY UPSET THAT GM IS NOT TAKING MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

WE DID NOT KNOW OF THE RECALL UNTIL AFTER THE TRUCK WAS IN THE SHOP.  I HOPE THAT GM REALIZES THEIR MISTAKES AND THAT I WILL RECIEVE SOME COMPENSATION FROM THEM.

ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH CLEAR CONDITIONS, HE WAS TRAVELING TO AN APPLE ORCHARD IN CONNECTICUT.  TRAVELING ABOUT 30 M.P.H., HE NOTICED A LARGE VEHICLE BACKING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY.  AS A DUMP TRUCK OPERATOR, HE IS WELL AWARE OF THE LIMITED VISIBILITY IN THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE FOR THE VEHICLE TO STOP.  SO, HE PUSHED THE BRAKES IN HIS VEHICLE AND THE BRAKES WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT ANY RESPONSE.  REALIZING HIS BRAKES HAD FAILED, HE IMMEDIATELY REALIZED HE NEEDED TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH THE SECOND VEHICLE.  HIS QUICK RESPONSE AND EXPERIENCE BEHIND THE WHEEL ALLOWED HIM TO MISS THE SECOND VEHICLE. HE DIDN'T WANT TO HIT THE VEHICLE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THE DRIVERS SIDE.  INSTEAD, HIS TRUCK BOLTED INTO A STONE WALL, FLIPPED AND ENDED UP IN BETWEEN TWO TREES. HIS AIR BAGS NEVER DEPLOYED. HE LANDED IN THE YARD OF SOMEONE'S HOME AND THE HOMEOWNER CALLED THE POLICE. THE POLICE SITED IN HIS POLICE REPORT THAT THE AIR BAG FAILED AND THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL AS WELL. MY FATHER ENDED UP WITH A FEW SCRAPES AND BRUISES AND HE IS JUST GLAD EVERYONE INVOLVED WAS ALRIGHT.  CHEVROLET NEVER TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MATTER.  HIS INSURANCE COMPANY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD PURSUE LEGAL ACTION BUT IT WOULD BE A LONG, DIFFICULT PROCESS.  ON THE CONSUMER PROTECTION WEBSITE, IT DOES INDICATE THAT CHEVROLET HAD RECALLED A FEW OF THEIR VEHICLES BECAUSE OF ANTI-LOCK PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, THE INCIDENT INVOLVING MY FATHER IS DUE TO ENTIRE BRAKE FAILURE. MY FATHERS MAIN MISSION NOW IS TO GET THE WORD OUT TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING TO ANYONE ELSE.  AS A MECHANIC, HE ALWAYS KEPT HIS VEHICLES IN TIP-TOP SHAPE MAKING SURE EVERYTHING WAS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND FREE OF DIRT, DEBRIS OR SALT IN THE WINTER.

WHEN I ASKED MY DEALER ABOUT THIS THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM.  HOWEVER WHILE DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I'VE FOUND A HUGE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS.    #2   WITH ABOUT 40000 MILES ON MY TRUCK THE REAR BRAKES STARTED MAKING SOME NOISE, SO I PULLED THE WHEELS OFF TO HAVE A LOOK AND FOUND THAT BOTH REAR ROTORS WERE CHEWED UP BEYOND BEING SERVICEABLE.  WHEN I TOOK THE BRAKES APART I FOUND THAT THE BRAKE PADS STILL HAD PLENTY OF MATERIAL ON THEM BUT THEY JUST DESTROYED THE ROTORS AS IF THE ROTORS WERE MADE OUT OF A STEEL THAT WAS TOO SOFT.  SO $350.00 FOR JUST THE PARTS IS WHAT THIS COST ME.  I SPOKE TO MY LOCAL DEALER ABOUT THIS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS BEFORE.

THE ONLY WAY TO ACCURATELY KNOW HOW MUCH GAS IS IN THE TANK IS TO RESET THE TRIP ODOMETER AT EACH FILL UP.      THIS APPARENTLY IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON CHEVY PICKUPS AS I'VE TALKED TO NUMEROUS CHEVY TRUCK OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS OCCURS ON SEVERAL DIUFFERENT MODEL YEAR TRUCKS.  THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM TO CHEVY SERVICE DEPARTMENTS, WHO SUGGEST OWNERS LIVE WITH THE PROBLEM UNTIL YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP, BECAUSE THE SENDING UNIT IS INSIDE THE GAS TANK ALONG WITH THE PUMP. THIS REPAIR IS IN THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE IT INVOLVES EITHER DROPPING THE GAS TANK OR REMOVING THE BED TO GET TO THE AFFECTED PARTS.    I BELIEVE THAT CHEVROLET SHOULD ORDER A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM AND REPAIR IT AT NO CHARGE TO OWNERS.  A NON FUNCTIONING GAS GAUGE IS AN ANNOYANCE AT THE LEAST, AND DANGEROUS AT THE WORST IF DRIVERS WERE TO RUN OUT OF FUEL ON A CROWDED STREET OR HIGHWAY, OR BE STRANDED WITHOUT FUEL IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS.    THE FACT THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME INDICATES GM IS UNWILLING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THE OWNERS' REPAIRS. THANK YOU.",

AT THIS TIME I HAVE PULLED THE ABS 60A FUSE AND I FEEL MUCH SAFER WITHOUT THE GM ABS SYSTEM.    THIS IS A SERIOUS GM PROBLEM AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ISN'T A FIX, RECALL, OR CONSUMER NOTIFICATION.  I WON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPEN, SINCE THE SERVICE MANAGERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM.

THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP BUT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF A CONCRETE COLUMN  UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE LOCATED AT STARLIGHT TERRACE.

THEY STATED THE  FUEL INJECTORS NEEDED CLEANED SO THEY PUT IN AN ADDITIVE.  THEY STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NORMAL AFTER 15,000 MILES.  A LITTLE WHILE LONGER MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ME TO THE AIRPORT (TWO HOURS FROM MY HOME) DURING THE TRIP THE TRUCK STARTED MAKING THE SAME NOISE AND HAVING THE SAME HESITATION PROBLEMS BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE VENGEANCE.  WHEN WE ARRIVED A THE AIRPORT  WE HAD TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF SO THAT I COULD UNLOAD MY TRAVEL BAGS.  MY WIFE TRIED TO START THE TRUCK TO LEAVE AND COULD NOT GET IT GOING.  I HAD TO LEAVE TO CATCH MY FLIGHT LEAVING MY WIFE AT THE CURB WITH A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE.  I DID GIVE HER THE INFORMATION FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  SHE CONTACTED  ROADSIDE HELP AND THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALER.  THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE STARTED AND FIXED SO THEY GOT MY WIFE A RENTAL AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE DEALER TO FIX THE TRUCK AND I WOULD RETURN AFTER MY TRIP TO PICK IT UP.  DURING THE TIME I HAD BEEN GONE I HAD FOUND OUT THROUGH MY WIFE THAT THE DEALER FELT THERE WAS A CRACKED BLOCK AND WOULD HAVE THE TRUCK FIXED FOR ME.   ON MY ARRIVAL BACK IN INDIANAPOLIS I MADE MY WAY TO THE DEALER.  THINKING I HAD A SOMEWHAT NEW ENGINE.  IN FACT I WAS TOLD THAT THEIR PROGNOSIS WAS WRONG AND THAT IT WAS JUST A OXYGEN SENSOR THAT HAD FAILED.  IT WAS GOOD AS NEW!    WELL HERE I AM NOT EVEN A YEAR LATER AND HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.  THIS TIME WITH ALL THREE KIDS AND MY WIFE IN THE TRUCK AND RETURNING FROM TOLEDO.    30 MINUTES ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT NIGHT, UNTIL IT STARTED AND LIMPED IT HOME.   *NLM",

AFTER THE FIRST SNOW STORM I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER WHO SIMPLY RECONNECTED EVERYTHING AND COMMENTED:  WE HAVE HAD ABOUT 45 SIMILAR CASES JUST THIS MORNING.  HE COMMENTED THAT THE WIPERS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED IN SUCH HEAVY SNOW.  THE SNOW BUILT UP UNDER THE WIPER ARM, PUTTING STRESS ON THE INTERNAL LINKAGE BELOW THE SHEET METAL, AND CAUSED THE LINKAGE TO POP APART.  HE SUGGESTED THAT I NOT DRIVE IN SUCH HEAVY SNOWFALL, OR THAT I KEEP THE LINKAGE CLEAR OF SNOW BUILDUP.  I POINTED OUT THE OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERN FOR PULLING OVER EVERY TEN MINUTES TO CLEAR AWAY SNOW FROM UNDER THE WIPER AND ALL HE COULD RESPOND TO THAT WAS:  \"FORD HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS CHEVROLET ON THESE WIPER LINKAGES COMING APART\".  THE SECOND STORM WAS LAST NIGHT.  I CAREFULLY REMOVED ALL SNOW FROM THE HOOD, FROM AROUND THE WIPERS, FROM ON TOP OF THE ROOF (SO SNOW COULD NOT SLIDE OFF IT ONTO THE WIPERS) AND AFTER 15 MINUTES OF DRIVING, THE PASSENGER WIPER FAILED WITH A LOUD MECHANICAL NOISE.  I STOPPED AND MEASURED THE SNOW THICKNESS ON THE HOOD AT LESS THAN ONE INCH.  I HAPPEN TO HAVE A DIGITAL CAMERA WITH ME AND TOOK SEVERAL PICTURES OF THE DEPTH OF THE SNOW IN THE DARK WITH A FLASH ATTACHMENT.  I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY DEFECT AND ONE WHICH THE NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE ON BEHALF OF ALL CHEVROLET PICKUP OWNERS.  AS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER I FIND THIS KIND OF FAILURE TO BE INEXCUSABLE AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED IT IN ANY OF THE FORTY PLUS VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED IN THE PAST. I AM 52 YEARS OLD.  YES, I WILL RETURN TO THE DEALER, AND AM UNHAPPY THAT PROBABLY THEY SIMPLY WILL HOOK THE LINKAGE BACK UP AND IT PROBABLY WILL FAIL AGAIN DURING THE NEXT SNOWSTORM.
