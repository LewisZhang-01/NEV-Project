THEY SAID THAT IT LOOKED FINE AND PUT A STICKER ON IT AFTER MAKING ME WAIT FOR 2 HOURS. THIS, EVEN THOUGH THE AFTERMARKET HITCH THAT IS INSTALLED ON MINE IS SO CORRODED THAT THE BALL AND ATTACHMENT POINT CANNOT BE REMOVED. WHEN I REMINDED THE DEALER OF THE FACTS, AND THAT HAVING THE HITCH STICKING OUT THAT FAR FROM THE BACK EXACERBATES THE HAZARD THAT EXISTS, HE ACTUALLY SAID \"THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM\".    SO IT APPEARS THAT ALL OF THESE DELAYS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN CHRYSLER ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS INTERNAL PLAN TO CERTIFY ALL INSTALLED TRAILER HITCHES AND NOT INSTALL NEW ONES. AND IN CASES LIKE MINE WHERE THE RISK IS EXACERBATED BY RUSTY SHARP HITCH COMPONENTS THAT MIGHT ACT AS A SPEAR TO PUNCTURE THE TANK, DEALERS COULD CARE LESS.     WHEN I OBTAINED A COPY OF THE ACTUAL RECALL DOCUMENT I FOUND THAT CHRYSLER HAS CAREFULLY CRAFTED A DISINCENTIVE FOR DEALERS TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN SAY THAT ANY HITCH INSTALLED MEETS THE STANDARD. THEY GET PAID .4 HOURS FOR INSPECTING, BUT ONLY 1 HOUR FOR REMOVING A RUSTY HITCH AND INSTALLING A COMPLETELY NEW ONE, WHICH WOULD LIKELY TAKE TWO HOURS. THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE LOSING MONEY ON EVERY HITCH THEY INSTALL AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF MAKING HITCH WIRING WORK ON ANY OF THOSE INSTALLED.     THE DEALERSHIP EVEN ADVISED ME TO TAKE MY HITCH OFF MYSELF AND COME BACK. WHAT A MONUMENTAL WASTE OF TIME - MINE AND YOURS, SINCE THEY  ARE CLEARLY THUMBING THEIR NOSE AT THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE NHTSA AGREEMENT. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE, BUT TO SAY IT'S NOT WORKING IS A PROFOUND UNDERSTATEMENT...  *TR",

AT A STOP LIGHT 2 MINUTES AFTER LEAVING, I PRESS THE GAS, AND THE CAR SEEMED TO STALL, AS IF THE ENGINE WAS GIVING WAY OR STUMBLING. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 4 TIMES, GETTING VERY CLOSE TO STALLING. THE FOLLOWING DAY, TODAY, APRIL 9TH, AFTER LEAVING THE CAR OFF FOR THE NIGHT,IT STARTED PERFECTLY. 2 MINUTES LATER, AT A STOP LIGHT, IT LOST ALL POWER. IT HAD TROUBLE TURNING OVER THE FIRST TWO ATTEMPTS, BUT THE THIRD TIME IT STARTED PERFECTLY. AFTER THAT, I BEGAN DRIVING AGAIN AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING, AGAIN THE CAR LOST ALL POWER. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL, TRIED TO START IT AGAIN. THE FIRST COUPLE ATTEMPTS THE ENGINE DIDN'T TURN OVER, BUT AGAIN, WHEN IT DID START, IT STARTED PERFECTLY. THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIMES. AFTER LEAVING AGAIN, IT WAS ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER IGNITION THAT WHEN ON A MAIN ROAD, IT DID NOT STALL COMPLETELY, BUT WAS LIKE IT WAS STARTING/TRYING TO. IT STUMBLED AND JERKED ROUGHLY. AFTER THAT, IT DROVE ROUGH, BEFORE I RETURNED HOME AND TURNED IT OFF. I AM AFRAID THAT IF I AM ON A HIGHWAY OR MAIN ROAD, THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AT A HIGHER SPEED, CAUSING AN ACCIDENT/HARM TO ME/DRIVERS AROUND ME.

I EXPLAINED THAT I WANTED SAFER SHOCKS AND I DIDN'T WANT THE VEHICLE TO ROLL-OVER, SO THEY TOOK THINGS APART AND FOUND THAT THE TIE RODS WERE JUNK.

OF COURSE, I ASSUMED THIS WAS RODE NOISE AND DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THAT MODEL OF VEHICLE.  THIS WAS DURING THE  WEEK OF JUNE 2004.  THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE JULY 4, 2001 IN AUSTIN TX AND I THOUGHT I PURCHASED A 3 YEAR EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN.  WHICH SHOULD HAVE COVERED IT.  WHAT I FOUND OUT IS THAT I PURCHASED A PLAN THAT EXTENDED THE ORIGINAL CARS COVERAGE FOR 3 YEARS.  I ENDED UP PURCHASING A CONTRACT FOR A PERIOD I DID NOT OWN THE CAR.  THE PLAN EXPIRED ON JUNE 10, 2004.  THIS WAS VERY MISLEADING BY THE CAR DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND THE CHRYSLER WARRANTY COMPANY WHEN I CALLED ABOUT IT DURING JUNE WHILE THE CAR WAS IN THE REPAIR SHOP.  THE WARRANTY COMPANY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR APPROXIMATELY $2,000 BECAUSE THEY HAD PREVIOUS CLAIMS ON THE VEHICLE.  I FEEL THIS REPAIR SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BECAUSE I PURCHASED A THREE YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN ON JULY 4, 2001 WHICH TO ME SHOULD HAVE ENDED JULY 4, 2004 AND THE REAR AXLE IS A  COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL OF VEHICLE.  HAD I KNOWN THE \"ROAD NOISE\" WAS REALLY A PROBLEM COMING INTO EXISTENCE OR HAD I PAID CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE WARRANTY INFORMATION WHEN I RECEIVED IT THIS COULD ALL HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.    IF THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE YOU CAN OFFER ANY ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE ON PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  THE INCIDENT DATE BELOW IS AN APPROXIMATION.  I DO NOT HAVE THE REPAIR ORDER IN FRONT OF ME WITH THE EXACT DATES.  YOUR WEBSITE WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION TODAY AND I WANTED TO GET THE DETAILS TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IF YOU CAN ASSIST WITH ANY OF THE WARRANTY WORK WITH CHRYSLER I CAN PROVIDE EXACT DATES AND POLICY INFORMATION AS NECESSARY.  THANK YOU.  *AK",

OUR CAR WAS DAMAGED BECAUSE THE BOTTOM OF THE GARAGE DOOR CLIPPED THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE DENTING AND SCRATCHING IT(THE VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED, THE GARAGE DOOR SUPRISINGLY WAS FINE).  THE JEEP WAS TAKEN IN TO BE REPAIRED AT AN AUTOBODY SHOP, AND I HAD TO PAY OVER 500 DOLLARS.  I THEN LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THAT VEHICLE, THE CAR HAS A TENDENCY TO SLIP INTO REVERSE SUDDENLY.  I CALLED JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE RIGHT WHEN I LEARNED OF THE RECALL,  I FAXED THEM ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION (THIS WAS JANUARY 2003) AND THEY EXAMINED THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM THEM AS THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR THE DAMAGE.  ALSO, THE VEHICLE DID NOT GET THE RECALL PART TO  FIX THE PROBLEM.  I AM VERY UPSET AS WE ARE VERY LUCKY THAT NO ONE WAS BEHIND THE VEHICLE WHEN IT JUMPED INTO REVERSE.  LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ANY HELP THAT YOU CAN GIVE US IN THIS MATTER.

MY MAIN CONCERN HERE IS NOT JUST THE POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE BUT ALSO THE INEVITABLE REOCCURRING COST.  I HAVE BEEN QUOTED A MINIMUM OF $350.00 TO REPAIR THE BOOTS.  THE DEALERSHIP WHICH I HAVE TAKEN MY JEEP TO HIGHLY RECOMMENDS THAT BOTH, THE FRONT BOOTS AND AXLE ASSEMBLIES BE REPLACED, WHICH WOULD BE A MINIMUM COST OF $425.00.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BRAND NEW.  WHEN I PURCHASED IT FROM HIM, I MET WITH HIM AT HIS PLACE OF BUSINESS AND TALKED WITH HIM AND SEVERAL OF HIS EMPLOYEES.  EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE OWNER HIMSELF, EMPHATICALY STATED THAT HE (THE OWNER) IN NO WAY HAS MISUSED THER VEHICLE OR HAS EVER TAKEN IT OFF THE ROAD.  I THOUROGHLY DISCUSSED THE HISTORY OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND I HAD CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO ABUSE OR NEGLECT.  THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED.

I BELIEVE THIS IS AN UNSAFE AND HAS CAUSED THIS OWNER TO RUN OUT OF GAS ONCE ON HIGHWAY I95 IN NY AND ONCE ON A BACK ROAD. CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND DOCUMENTED THE ISSUE ON THIS VEHICLE BUT TO NO AVAIL.

SEVERAL TIMES I BROUGHT IT IN WHILE UNDER WARRANTY TO HAVE IT REPAIRED BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD CUT OUT, STALL AND BECOME SLUGGISH.  THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM, OR IN SOME CASES THEY JUST STATED THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  OF COURSE AFTER THE WARRANTEE RAN OUT BY TIME AND MILES THE CAR WENT DEAD ON ME AND I WAS ADVISED THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE FUEL TANK.  THE FUEL TANK IS DESIGN SUCH THAT IT DETERIORATES AND PLUGS THE FUEL PUMP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.  I LEARNED THIS THROUGH PARTS SUPPLIERS WHO WERE UNWILLING TO GIVE A GUARRANTEE ON THEIR PUMPS KNOWING THE TANK WOULD CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND PLUG THE PUMP.  THE DEALER TOLD ME HE WANTED OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE TANK BECAUSE OF THE DETERIORATION.  HE REFUSED TO REPLACE ONLY THE FUEL PUMP AND TOLD ME THE TANK WAS DEFECTIVE.  OF COURSE THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION REFUSED TO WARRANTEE THE PRODUCT AFTER THE TIME AND MILES WERE UP.  MY QUESTION IS THIS: IF THE FUEL TANK IS DETERIORATING BECAUSE OF A DESIGN FAULT IS THAT A SAFETY PROBLEM.  I MYSELF HAVING A LIMITED MECHANICAL BACKGROUD WOULD THINK SO.  THESE TANKS ARE DETERIORATING IN THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES AND CHRYSLER IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DOUBT A FUEL TANK IS A CRITICAL PART OF A VEHICLE, AND I DON'T THINK JEEP IS GOING TO CON THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS INTO CHANGING THEIR FUEL TANKS.  AT THIS TIME I NEED A VEHICLE TO DRIVE AND I AM GOING TO REPLACE MY FUEL PUMP NOT THE TANK.  HOWEVER IF THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN WHY ISN'T JEEP VOLUNTARILY TAKING CARE OF IT.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH THIS ISSUE.  THANK YOU.  BRENDAN FINNERTY",

I SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM BEFORE I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THEM.  I SOLD THE CAR SHORTLY THEREAFTER AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  I AM SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAIN JUST IN CASE MY INCIDENT CAN HELP WITH THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION.  THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT IN THE SHIFTER.  I KNEW OTHERS WOULD HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND SOONER OR LATER SOMETHING WOULD COME OF IT FOR CHRYSLER.  I DOCUMENTED THE ENTIRE EVENT, HOWEVER, CURRENTLY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND MY DOCUMENTATION (THIS TOOK PLACE OVER 2 YEARS AGO. YET, I AM STILL LOOKING).

I STOPPED, PUT THE VEHICLE IN \"PARK\"  GOT OUT AND OPENED THE GATE.  I RE-ENTERED THE VEHICLE AND DROVE THROUGH THE GATE STOPPING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE.  I ONCE AGAIN PLACED THE VEHICLE IN \"PARK\" AND STEPPED FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT TO CLOSE THE GATE I HAD JUST DRIVEN THROUGH.  I WAS STANDING AT ABOUT THE LEFT REAR TAIL LIGHT WALKING TOWARDS THE GATE TO CLOSE IT WHEN I NOTICED THE JEEP MOVING PAST ME TOWARDS THE GATE I HAD JUST DRIVEN THROUGH.  I TURNED TO MY LEFT, TOWARDS THE JEEP TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I SAW IT MOVING IN REVERSE JUST AS THE OPEN DRIVER'S DOOR STRUCK ME KNOCKING ME TO THE GROUND.  I ROLLED AWAY UNDER THE OPEN DOOR AS FAST AS I COULD SO I WOULDN\"T BE RUN OVER BY THE FRONT TIRE.  WHEN I MANAGED TO GET TO MY FEET I SAW THE GATE CATCH THE OPEN DRIVER'S DOOR AND FOLD IT AGAINST THE FRONT FENDER.  THE JEEP WAS MOVING IN REVERSE AT ABOUT 10 MPH TOWARDS A HEAVILY TRAVELLED ROAD SO I RAN AFTER IT AS FAST AS I COULD.  I WAS ABLE TO DIVE INTO THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND JAM THE SHIFT LEVER INTO PARK JUST AS THE JEEP CRASHED INTO A PARKED CAR.

KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITHOUT TAKING THE CAR OFF THE FLAT-BED OR LOOKING AT IT! HE TOLD ME TO HAVE THE TOW-TRUCK DRIVER TO TOW IT TO THE GAS STATION AND IT WOULD START , FOR ME TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL SENDING UNIT. WHICH THEY DID. ( THE CAR DID START WHEN I PUT GAS IN IT ) CHRYSLER CLAIMS THAT THEIR IS NO RECALL ON MY YEAR AND THAT THE \"TECHNICIAN\" IS JUST VERY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES. NO ONE CAN TELL WHAT CAUSES A MOVING CAR TO STALL AND NOT RE-START FROM 100 FT AWAY UNLESS THERE IS A PROBLEM SPECIFIC TO THAT VEHICLE. I UNDERSTAND THE '97 DID HAVE A RECALL. DID THEY EVER STOP USING THE SAME PART OR DID THEY USE UP WHAT THEY HAD LEFT? AND THEN CHANGE. CHRYSLER WON'T EVEN PAY MY TOWING CHARGE FOR WHICH I AM SUING.PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS.

MY TIRES GAVE A KNOCKING SOUND AND THE BEST WAY I KNOW TO DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM, IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WERE ABOUT TO COME ALOOSE FROM MY VECHICLE. I WENT TO MY LOCAL FIRESTONE DEALER AND THEY ASSURED ME THE TIRES WERE \"OK\" EACH TIME I WENT. I VISITED A FIRESTONE DEALER ON 8/7/00 AND HE STATED AS A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION GESTURE, HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO TRADE MY TIRES IN AND GET SOME REPLACEMENT TIRES. THE TIRES WERE TO BE IN ON THURSDAY 8/10/00 AND THEY WOULD BE MOUNTED ON MY VECHICLE AT THAT TIME. FIRESTONE DID A RECALL ON 8/9/00 AND WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALER, HE STATED HE COULD NOT REPLACE MY TIRES BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO REPLACE A CERTAIN TIRE AND MY TIRE WAS NOT ON THE LIST. I URGED HIM TO REPLACE THEM AS WE HAD AGREED AND ALLOW ME TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BUT HE REFUSED (THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN ANYWAY). HE THEN PROCEEDED TO HANG UP. I TOOK MY VECHICLE IN ON 8/7 AND 8/8 SO THEY COULD TEST DRIVE THE VECHICLE TO SEE HOW THE TIRES PERFORMED. EACH TIME THEY ASSURED ME THE TIRES WERE \"OK\". TO DATE, I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTS FROM THESE TIRES. HOWEVER, I URGE YOUR OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE THE IDEA OF FIRESTONE EXPANDING THIS RECALL. I PLAN TO PURCHASE SOME MORE TIRES BECAUSE I TIRED OF FIGHTING WITH THIS COMPANY ABOUT MY COMPLAINTS. I HAVEN'T BEEN SATISFIED WITH THESE TIRES SINCE THEY WERE PURCHASED. I SENT AN E-MAIL TO FIRESTONE ON 8/8 AND ON 8/7 I CONTACTED THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPT AND THE RECEPTIONIST DID A 3-WAY CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE MANAGER OF MY LOCAL FIRESTONE COMPANY ON RODNEY PARHAM RD. IN LITTLE ROCK. HIS NAME WAS DAVE (?) AND HE TOLD ME TO BRING MY TRUCK IN AND HE WOULD DO A REPLACEMENT. AFTER THE RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED, HE CHANGE HIS MIND. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE COMPANY, NOR DO I EXPECT TO. I DO WANT THIS COMPLIANT LOGGED.*",

I WAS GIVEN ANOTHER APPIONTMENT TO CORRECT THE JOB FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND IT STILL WAS NOT CORRECTED. FOR 4 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE DEALER 2 TIMES A MONTH FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.I HAVE PAID FOR THE JOB 3 TIMES FROM ALL THESE TIMES. THEY HAVE CHANGD THE WORLD OF PARTS AND THE NOISE IS STILL WORSE THAN BEFORE. I NORMALLY LEAVE THE VEHICLE FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES, BUT THE JOB CANNOT BE CORRECTED YET. AT PRESENT THE VEHICLE IS AT THE DEALER FOR THE SAME BRAKE JOB, AND AFTER FIVE DAYS OF CHANGING PARTS AND THE PROBLEM STIIL PERSIST, THE DEALER IS CALLING ME TO SIGN AND PICK UP THE VEHICLE, AND THEY WILL CALL ME AT SOME PIONT TO RETURN IT WHEN THEY HAVE THE CORRECT TOOL TO DETECT WHERE THE NOISE IS COMING FROM. THIS TOOL I WAS TOLD BY A REP WAS ALREADY ODERED FROM CHRSLER 2 MONTHS AGO FOR AN INTREPID WITH SAME PROBLEM, BUT IS YET TO ARRIVE IN P.R. I AM RENTING CARS ALL THE TIMES AND MY VEHICLE WOULD BE RETURNED TO AFTER 5 DAYS SOME TIMES FROM THE DEALER WITH JOB INCOMPLETE AND A NEW APPIONTMENT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WHICH FOR 4 MONTHS CANNOT BE SOLVED. THE FINAL IDEA FROM THE DEALER IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHANGING ALL THESE PARTS, AND THE NOISE STILL PERSIST(GREATER).

THE FIRST, SHE NOTICED A SPRAYING OF OILY FLUID NEAR THE TOP OF THE RADIATOR MORE TOWARDS THE AREA NEAR THE BATTERY. AT THAT POINT, SHE NOTICED THAT THE INTERIOR PORTION OF THE HOOD HAD SOME DARK OILY SPOT.  I HAS SUSPICION THAT IT HAD ORIGINATED  FROM A LEAKING 3/8 -1/2\" FITTING ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE  RADIATOR AND LEADING TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE TRANSMISSION. SHE BROUGHT IT IN THE DEALERSHIP FOR AN INSPECTION.  MASTER  MECHANIC INSPECTED THE SUSPECTED AREA. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID LINE CONNECTS TO THE RADIATOR TO ALLOW THE OIL TO COOL OR SOMETHING  LIKE THAT. ANYWAYS, THEY WENT AHEAD AND PLACED TEFLON TAPE AT THE AREA. PROBLEM #2, I NOTICE SOME OIL ON THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE FLOOR MAT.  THE LOCATION OF THE SPILL HAD OCCURRED UNDERNEATH, TO THE LEFT, OF THE STEERING WHEEL COLUMN OR UNDERNEATH WHERE THEY WOULD PLACE THE CONNECTOR TO  PERFORM THE COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC . THE AREA WOULD BE WHERE THE LEFT FOOT  WOULD NORMAL REST ON THE MAT. THE AREA OF THE SPILL WAS ABOUT 8\" IN LENGTH AND 3\" IN WIDTH.  THE VISCOSITY WOULD BE OF A DIRTY BRAKE FLUID OIL, HYDRAULIC, OR POWER STEERING FLUID. THE AMOUNT WOULD BE ABOUT 1 - 1 1/2 TABLESPOON FULL.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IT COULD BE DAMAGING SOMETHING IF THE OIL VACATED A RESERVOIR/FLUID LINE OR THE RISK  THAT THE BRAKES CAN FAIL IF IT IS BRAKE FLUID.
