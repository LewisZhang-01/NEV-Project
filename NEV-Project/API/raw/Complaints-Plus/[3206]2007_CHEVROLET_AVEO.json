THEN IT COMPLETELY STAYS ON, THIS HAPPENED SOME TIME LATER THE SAME YEAR, I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LIGHT SHOULD NOT STAY ON, THAT INDICATES THAT ALL THE AIRBAGS ARE DISABLED. I ASKED IF THEY WOULD FIX IT, AS THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY MAJOR CRASH. HE SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO FIX THE AIRBAGS AT MY COST. I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE AVEO. CHEVROLET INSTALLED COUNTERFEIT AIRBAGS OR ITS CONNECTORS. I BELIEVE CHEVY SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF IGNORING IT.   *TR",

WE PUT WATER IN IT AND WAITED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING TO TAKE TO THE DEALERSHIP WE PURCHASED THE CAR FROM.  THEY SAID IT APPEARED THAT I HAD HIT SOMETHING AND THE BOTTOM OF THE RADIATOR WAS DAMAGED HOWEVER I KEPT SAYING I DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING AND THEY TOLD ME TO TRY TO TURN IT IN TO MY INSURANCE AND SEE IT THEY WOULD COVER IT.  ONE MAN EVEN WALKED ME TO THE CAR AND SAID IF I NEEDED HELP THAT \"HELP ME OUT\".  THAT AFTERNOON I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY TELLING THEM EXACTLY WHAT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT I HAD TO HAVE HIT SOMETHING BUT I DIDN'T REMEMBER HITTING ANYTHING WOULD THEY COVER IT.  IN THE END THE INSURANCE COMPANY COVERED THE REPAIR OF THE RADIATOR PLUS 5 DAYS OF RENTAL CAR.  WHEN WE WENT TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE ON THE RADIATOR, WE ASKED FOR THE OLD RADIATOR BACK.  MY HUSBAND TOOK IT BACK TO HIS SHOP AND DID A PRESSURE TEST ON IT.  THE HOLE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT NOT IN THE BOTTOM AND YOU COULD SEE WHERE THE FAN SHROUD LINED UP WHERE THE RADIATOR MOUNTS TO IT AND IT HAD RUBBED A HOLE IN IT CAUSING THIS WHOLE PROBLEM.  EVEN THOUGH THE INSURANCE COVERED THIS, I STILL THOUGHT RETRIBUTION NEEDED TO BE MADE BECAUSE PERHAPS THIS WAS A LEMON CAR OR EITHER A RECALL NEEDED TO BE DONE.  THIS HAPPENED AT 23,000 MILES APPROXIMATELY.  THEN THE FOLLOWING MONTH THE SAME FAN SHROUD RUBBED A HOLE IN THE AIR CONDITION LINE AND WE WERE WITHOUT AIR ABOUT 2,000 MILES LATER AND THE DEALERSHIP TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND COVERED THIS UNDER THE WARRANTY.  IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.  I HAVE CALLED GMAC AND THEY HAVE SAID THE DEALERSHIP ARE THEIR EYES AND EARS AND WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THE OLD RADIATOR BACK SO THEY COULD SEE WHAT WE SAW .   *TR",
