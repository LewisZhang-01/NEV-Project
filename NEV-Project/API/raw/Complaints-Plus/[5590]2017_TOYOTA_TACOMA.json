The engine will rev up like it was in neutral then abruptly catch the reverse gear causing a loud and disturbing \u201cBANG\u201d and even some tire spin on the pavement. I also intermittently experience a loud \u201cCLUNK\u201d when slowing down to a stop in traffic as if the transmission is not downshifting properly from the higher gears to the lower ones and is forced to come to an abrupt halt. The dealer has performed a software update but this has not helped. The dealer also cannot replicate these problems because the issues are intermittent.

MY OTHER CONCERN WAS ABOUT SHIFTING OR THY LACK OF ENGAGING IN FOUR WEEK DRIVE. TOYOTA AGREED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AND SAID HERE YOU GO. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME PROBLEMS ARE STILL OCCURRING. MY TRUCK HAS BEEN AT MAUI TOYOTA FOR MONTHS NOW. THEY ARE NOW SAYING THAT THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AND THEY AGREE THAT IT'S NO BETTER BUT THA IT'S IN RUNNING CONDITION. I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO ALL SERVICE HONOLULU WHERE I HAVE BEEN BASICALLY LEFT BLIND. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL SITUATION GOING ON SO I FIGURED THAT HAS PART TO DO WITH NOT GETTING ANY UPDATES. YESTERDAY MAUI TOYOTA CALLS AND INFORMED ME THAT THEY WILL HAVE MY TRUCK TOWED ON TUESDAY. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SAY THE LEAST.

WHEN I LEFT, IT APPEARED TO BE FIXED FOR THE FIRST 5 MILES, THEN THE PROBLEM RETURNED AND IS GETTING WORSE. I CONTACTED TOYOTA, COMPLAINT 170206-000100. I RECEIVED A RETURN EMAIL THE SAME DAY AND SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALL SEVERAL DAYS LATER. I WAS ADVISED I WOULD BE CONTACTED WITHIN A WEEK FOR RESOLUTION OR PLAN OF ACTION. THAT WEEK HAS COME AND GONE. MEANWHILE, THE TRUCK CONTINUALLY GETS WORSE. TWICE, I HAVE ACCELERATED FROM STOP AND THE TRUCK SEEMS TO SHIFT IN NEUTRAL AND I HAD TO LET OFF THE PEDAL FOR IT TO ACCELERATE AGAIN. ONE OF THOSE TIMES, I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED.  IT IS WORSE WHEN DRIVING IN THE CITY. THE TRUCK BEGINS JERKING AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET IT TO ACCELERATE. I FEEL IT IS VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE, BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE. I ALMOST FEEL LIKE I NEED A TOW TRUCK, AMBULANCE, AND ATTORNEY TO FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE. I HOPE THIS WILL AT LEAST BRING AWARENESS TO AN UNSAFE ISSUE AND OTHERS WILL BE SPARED THE POTENTIAL RESULTS.",
