        "summary": "Last night, my BRAND NEW car (Jeep Grand Cherokee L Limited) tried to kill me. Driving down 1187 going 40 miles an hour, it came to a DEAD STOP, put itself in park and would not crank or start back up. All I could hear in the panic was screeching tires from cars trying not to hit me. The seatbelt also did not stop me and I was thrown into the steering wheel. My car has less than 900 miles on it.  After a panic attack of EPIC proportions and a sleepless night, I immediately drove it to the dealership today and of course they can find NOTHING wrong with it. They are going to keep it a few days to double check a few things, but to say I will no longer be able to drive this car without SEVERE anxiety is an understatement. It has less than 1000 miles on it and I haven't even made my first payment. Trading it in, I will automatically lose $3100. If I don't trade it in, I don't think I would ever be able to get over the anxiety of driving it. Talk about a lose/lose situation. All I could think about is if I had been going faster and there had been more traffic, I could have KILLED someone including myself. Thank you to the kind salesman who, when I pulled up this morning, said \"I love your car\" and I proceeded to break down crying and hand him the keys and say you can keep it. He was so helpful in calming me and getting it checked out right away.  I've owned it 21 days exactly. Honestly I am not sure I want to take the chance of it happening again.",

I was traveling at approx. 55mph on the interstate. Because the power steering failed, the active lane management features also malfunctioned.   Safety Impact: I was driving on the interstate at a high speed. Fortunately I was on a straight-away and had time to react for an upcoming turn/bend in the highway. Loss of power steering made it difficult to change lanes, merge, and make turns. This decreased safety by making it more difficult to control the vehicle. The lane management feature also malfunctioned and decreased safety. This features warns me if the car is crossing into another lane and also provides steering assistance to course correct when the driver doesn't respond fast enough. Because power steering and lane management failed, I had difficulty turning the vehicle and maintaining safe position in my lane, especially on curvy and high-speed roads.   Inspection/Reproduction of Issue: The vehicle is currently at the dealer where it was purchased for inspection by the service dept. This issue has not been reproduced on this particular vehicle. However, this issue was confirmed and reproduced on another Grand Cherokee L I purchased in November 2021.

This causes accumulated snow or off-road dirt to easily be pushed to the driver side window (with no way to wash off) and blocking the driver\u2019s side mirror. This makes it impossible to to use the blind spot light on the side mirror. In my case, I had audio alarm turned off as not to wake the kids while driving across the country. So I had a couple of near misses until I was able to stop, clean the driver\u2019s window and turn the blind spot alarm back on. This is not a big deal if driving in clear rain, just not off-road or snow. It\u2019s available for inspection whenever needed. -Our safety was placed at risk by creating a blind spot, making my driver\u2019s side mirror and sensor obsolete. This created me nearly striking the cars beside me.  -I just returned from the dealership(Puyallup-Larsen Jeep)an hour ago and the staff admitted it was a flaw. They actually recommend I go buy some aftermarket window lip, that does not exist. It was disgraceful to say the least for them to admit a flaw and suggest I fix it on my own, after having my car for 8 hours and it having 3500 miles on it. -No warning lights other than the blind spot sensors activating that I could be sure was activated or not.     #2: The third row seat over heated the phone charging cord, causing light cabin smoke and burning a slight hole in the gym bag. My 7 y/o twins were woken up and advised me she think she smelled smoke. I figured it was nothing, it a brand new vehicle. She said \u201csomething is burning Dad\u201d. I turned the cabin light on as my 14 y/o said she now smelled something in the second row. I saw a light fog and immediately pulled over, ran to the back and yanked out the cord out of the car. The cord was overheated to my touch. The cord had burned the plastic bag the Happy Meal toy was inside. Available for inspection whenever.",

Because this is occurring when the vehicle is first beginning to accelerate this is happening when entering intersections, changing lanes, and crossing lanes causing the vehicle to rev while either coasting (due to the positive motion prior to shifting) or sit motionless when on-coming traffic is approaching.  The only way to get the vehicle back in motion is to completely stop the vehicle (irrespective of the dangerous location) put the vehicle in park, then back in drive, and try accelerating again in hopes that the vehicle will shift on a second attempt.  One one of the three occasions so far, this occurred while exiting a parking lot but before entering a changing lane on a busy street.  On another occasion it caused me to get stuck on a blind curve.  The issue occurs intermittently and to date I have not been able to get the dealer to remedy the issue.  Their text msg response at TransitTowne Jeep Chrysler Dodge RAM in Elma, New York, is that \"..there is no codes in the system and there is no updates available for the software.  There is nothing to diagnose if there is no code and everything checks out in the system. ... The Jeep does have an 8 speed transmission that is all electronically controlled and it can take some getting used to.\"  This is the response I received after dropping the vehicle off at 10 a.m. and receiving a call the same day that my car is ready to be picked up at exactly 1:03 p.m. (which included the time to perform an oil change, tire rotation, resolve a missing trim issue, and investigate an issue with the tailgate).  The only warning was the beep that goes off when the car is in close proximity of an impact (due to the other cars approaching as I try to get the back in motion) but the warning is useless until I can get the car back in motion to avoid an impact.",

It was our celebration purchase to mark the start of our ability to finally blend our families and move our future forward. We bought the car because it\u2019s a 6 seater, we have four kids and the two of us.   Less than two weeks into the purchase She was driving down the highway when she heard a massive explosion from above and thought that she\u2019d been shot. She could hear the glass rain down on her so she called the police and pulled over. She then called me panicked and upset.   I knew the moment that she started to explain what had happened that the sunroof had popped / shattered not being able to withstand torsion within the normal flex of a large suv roof. I\u2019d heard about this before as I had been cautious about purchasing a larger vehicle with a panoramic sunroof. I had researched it before buying my truck. But never experienced a sunroof explosion nor knew anyone that had had it happen.    Immediately after consulting with state police and DOT (the searched for debris to cause the shatter and found none) we drove the vehicle immediately back to the dealership where we\u2019d purchased the car a week or so before. Everyone at the dealership was extremely accommodating and immediately without question got us into a rental vehicle without worry of cost. Unfortunately the rental is only a five seater.   That was mid August. Now in mid October we\u2019re being told by Jeep that it wasn\u2019t their fault and that we should pay for this, but that they\u2019re doing us a favor by covering it under warranty. We\u2019ve asked Jeep to get us into a new vehicle or refund us as they\u2019re telling us it will take another 6-8 weeks for the part to get to the dealer. We\u2019ve made 2 payments to a car that we don\u2019t have and about to make another. Yet Jeep won\u2019t reimburse us for the inconvenience.
