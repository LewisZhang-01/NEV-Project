I had to stop in the middle of the road to find coolant had splattered on part of the engine and was leaking.  Upon further inspection this morning I found there is a missing bolt on the radiator and it is cracked and a hose apparently burst.  Called the dealership and states this is not covered by the warranty since I\u2019m on my 4th year and the type of part that it is, however, the only people to have ever worked on this vehicle have been the dealership and they have never had to do any repairs on the car, only regular oil changes and a warranty repair to my Uconnect screen that was faulty.  There is no reason why this would have happened other thanks faulty parts. Upon investigating further I found that 2018 Rams with Ecodiesel engine(I have a gas engine) have a recall for the same issue and many people are having issues getting repair issues due to parts. I have also found other people with gas engines with similar issues. I\u2019d like to have some resolution with the manufacturer do they may cover their issue, not have to pay out of pocket for this.",

Recently, the contact stated that while her husband was driving at 65 MPH, the vehicle failed to accelerate upon depression of the accelerator pedal; two unknown warning lights also appeared on the instrument panel. As her husband pulled over, a white color smoke began to emit from the engine. Upon lifting up the engine's hood, her husband saw flames coming from under the engine. Her husband immediately called 911 and while on the phone with the dispatcher, the vehicle became engulfed in flames. The fire department arrived ten minutes later and extinguished the fire. The contact was uncertain if a fire report was filed; no injuries were reported. The vehicle was towed to two independent mechanics where it was later deemed a total loss.

The cruise control had disengaged and the truck seemed to go into limp home mode and the check engine light came on. I pulled to the side of the road and shut the engine off. I looked under the truck to see if I had run over something and checked the drive line for damage but found none. Restarting the engine took considerably more crank time than normal. While driving home the truck would not accelerate normally and top speed uphill was 19-23 mph depending on the climb with rpm around 3000 before what felt like fuel cut off and immediate deceleration until rpm was dropped to around 2000. The 5 hour trip home turned into an 8 hour trip.   The check engine DTC is P0336 (crank position sensor A circuit range/performance).    There is a recall W58 (20V475000) for software update for loss of crankshaft position sensor signal. This update substitutes the camshaft position sensor signal for the lost crankshaft signal. There is a known defect with the tone ring on the 3.0 eco diesel. The magnetic material on the tone ring delaminates.  The software update does not fix the loss of crankshaft signal.      The engine now has excessive crank time before starting. There is an a noticeable aceleration lag and the truck struggles on uphill grades. The cruise  control is now inoperable with the crank signal DTC is permanent until the tone ring is replaced.    My repair shop checked for parts avaiability and found dodge has 22,000 in stock which leads me to believe that they not only know about the problem but also know the only true fix is to replace the failed tone ring.

Everything in vehicle was thrown forward. I struggled to keep control and thought I was going to roll and crash off of roadway, or hit another vehicle.  This was not a problem for two years, until June of this year. Driven the same stretch of highway a dozen times without incident. 21,000 on vehicle now. I took the RAM tech for a ride to reproduce the incident. Did it on a small hill at 25-30mph and reproduced the problem several times at the same location of the hill. Transmission drops into lower gear, makes a kind of grinding or similar noise. Then it stays in this lower gear straining until the brake is pushed to turn cruise off. Told him of losing control on big hill and nearly crashing. No warning lights or warning of any kind. Their response that a slight speed change is BS. 65mph to 30 or what it was in a couple seconds is not slight. It also states temporary. Even with the tech seeing it, it is not temporary. You have to push the brake to get it back into the right gear. At 30mph on test runs. Losing control of vehicle and they come up with this.  You can inspect my vehicle.  No sales rep ever mentioned that you shouldn't use cruise control on a hill. What a scam. Not happy with my RAM purchase now.",

At the time of this visit my mileage had reached 36,700, which they state is 700 miles out of warranty.

It will put my family on hold, and will fight me to keep it off hold. It also randomly calls, anyone in my phone book, them switches. There have been multiple times then the screen doesn\u2019t allow me to change anything. I have went on the computer and there are plenty of similar experiences by others, shown in video. Their screen are also separated. I\u2019m afraid my car will catch on fire. This is a very serious situation and I\u2019m trying to find a resolution.

The unit is the Uconnect 4C by Harman.  This system has a problem with the touchscreen delaminating, or coming loose, from the display.  When this happens, the touchscreen will send multiple and variable \"touches\" without user involvement.   While driving my vehicle on 10/5/2021, this fault caused my navigation system to change to an unreadable state, which resulted in a serious distraction while driving.  The distraction lead to my approaching near to another vehicle on the road and resulting in a subsequent swerve to avoid a collision.  This problem is a SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE due to the distracting nature of the display in this condition.  The issue is a known issue by both Uconnect company and the Chrysler company.  I have reported the safety issue and they are unwilling to address it.  The first picture provided shows the delamination of the touchscreen from the display.  The effect can be seen by a semi-circular line about halfway down the display.  The second picture provided shows a non-commanded screen press at the top center of the screen (note the circle indicating the recognition of a push).  This was observed to happen 14 times in 16 seconds.  I have videos (not provided) of the what happens during navigation.  It is extremely distracting during navigation and makes driving in a high-traffic situation almost impossible.  There is not a way to turn off the display, which in turn forces the distraction continuously and without a way for driver intervention.  This problem is known throughout the industry, which I learned by contacting my local Dodge dealer and the Uconnect company.  Many reports exist on the internet, also.    NOTE:  This is not a wear out item and there is nothing in the manual about routine safety maintenance on the touchscreen or the unit.  i.e. not user serviceable.",

This is unsafe because with all of the flickering around on the screen, it is very distracting to drive. I cannot turn the screen display off because it keeps turning itself back on. Also, this issue has rendered my hands free blue tooth connection for my phone inoperable. I am also concerned that this electrical issue may cause a fire. My dealership informed me that my factory warranty had expired by less than a month. I called Dodge customer service and they refused to pay for the repairs under the factory warranty. I informed them of the safety issue that this is causing, but they still refused to fix it. Therefore, I am having to pay for these repairs through the extended warranty plan that I purchased from Carmax and partially out of pocket.

PROBLEMS THAT THIS CAUSES;    - LEAKING EXHAUST TRIPS THE O2 SENSOR CHANGING THE FUEL TRIMS AND CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO RUN RICH. THE VEHICLE ALWAYS RUNNING RICH EFFECTS THE ECO MODE AND VEHICLE PERFORMANCE THUS CAUSES LONG TERM DAMAGE.    - WHEN THE BOLTS SNAP OFF THEY DROP OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE VEHICLE AND BECOME A PROJECTILE THAT HITS THE WINDSHIELD OF UNSUSPECTING DRIVERS AND CAUSE ACCIDENTS.    - HEAT CAUSED FROM THE HEAT SHIELD FALLING OFF AND THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD BEING LOOSE CAUSES WIRES IN THE ENGINE BAY TO MELT AND FRAY. THIS CAUSES ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS TO MAJOR SYSTEMS IN THE VEHICLE TO INCLUDE SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT KEEP THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SAFE.    - LEAKING EXHAUST CAUSES EROSION TO THE ENGINE BLOCK AND THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD AS  IT WARPS EVEN MORE.    THIS MALFUNCTION IS A HAZARD TO NOT ONLY THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER OF THE VEHICLE BUT ALSO UNSUSPECTING DRIVERS ON THE ROAD THAT WILL BE COME VICTIMS TO PROJECTILES FROM THIS DEFECT.
