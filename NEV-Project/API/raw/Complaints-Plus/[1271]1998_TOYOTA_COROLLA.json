        "summary": "My auto mechanic and I, after extensive diagnosis, have confirmed that the Pulse mileage/route tracking device that Metromile car insurance had me plug into the computer port of my 1998 Toyota Corolla LE is failing or has failed, and this caused a potentially disastrous situation to develop w/my car engine.  When starting the engine from cold, it would cause repeated misfires, causing the rpms to drop quickly, then surge up, before settling into the proper cold idle speed.  This would repeat itself every few seconds until the engine warmed up completely (usually about 10 minutes).  When in gear, the car would buck violently, putting repeated, extreme stress on the drive train; but even when in neutral gear, two mechanics have told me it could easily destroy my crankshaft bearings and/or other parts of the drive train.  We have now tested this five times briefly in neutral gear.  When we plug the pulse device in the problem occurs immediately.  When we remove the device the problem goes away.  We can also insert the mechanic's diagnostic device into the computer port and everything works fine.  The new \"Pulse\" device was received as a replacement for the old one I had been using, that had worked fine, and was first inserted into the computer port on 8/9/21.  So it worked fine for about a month.  Supposedly the only difference between the old and new devices is that the new one uses 5G instead of 4G to receive and transmit data.",

THIS SECOND DEALERSHIP AFTER A FEW ATTEMPTS, IDENTIFIED THAT THE SAME CENTRAL AIRBAG ASSEMBLY THAT WAS REPLACED IN SEP 1, 2004 WAS DEFECTIVE. THEY ORDERED A SECOND REPLACEMENT AND FITTED MY CAR WITH THE NEW PART. THIS HAPPENED IN NOV 2006.     HOWEVER 2 MONTHS AFTER THE AIRBAG REPLACEMENT,IN FEB 2007 THE SAME AIRBAG PROBLEM REOCCURED FOR A 3RD TIME. I CONTACTED TOYOTA MOTOR SALES USA, INC AT 1901 SOUTH WESTERN AVENUE - WC 10,  TORRANCE, CA 90501 TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR. I SENT THEM ALL THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. HOWEVER INSPITE OF EXPLAINING THE THREAT TO MY LIFE CAUSED BY THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAG, TOYOTA HAS NOT COME FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE SPENT CLOSE TO $1500 ON THE PROBLEM ALREADY OVER THE COURSE OF 3 YEARS. EVEN THOUGH THE CAR IS A 1998 MAKE, THE AIRBAGS WERE REPLACED IN SEP 2004 AND NOV 2006 AND ARE STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I REQUEST YOU TO INSTRUCT TOYOTA TO REPAIR THE AIRBAG AT NO EXTRA COST TO ME.  TOYOTA'S REFERENCE NUMBER FOR MY CASE IS 200706250076.",

I HIT THE VEHICLE PARKED IN FRONT OF ME; VERY LITTLE DAMAGE AS MY CAR WAS ALMOST STOPPED WHEN IT SURGED FORWARD AND BRAKE FAILED.  THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAD HAPPENED.  THE FIRST TIME WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED AS I WAS PULLING INTO MY CAR PORT.  THE BRAKE WENT TO THE FLOOR AND CAR SURGED FORWARD.  THAT TIME I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND JUST THOUGHT MY FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED.  THIS TIME, I HAD TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CAR AND WE ALL WITNESSED THE SURGE AND THE BRAKE PEDAL ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR (USELESS).  AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE HAS STOPPED (BY HITTING SOMETHING EACH TIME), THE BRAKE GOES BACK TO ITS USUAL POSITION.  I TOOK THE CAR TO CLASSIC TOYOTA HERE IN TYLER THE NEXT DAY WHEN I DROVE BACK HERE.  THEY SAID THEY INSPECTED IT AND COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  I WAS VERY UPSET AND IT WAS ANNOTATED ON THE JOB TICKET.  I CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND LEFT MY NAME AND PHONE NUMBER WITH THE DRIVER OF THE CAR I HIT IN THE GROCERY STORE LOT.  IF THIS HAD HAPPENED JUST MINUTES BEFORE AS I STOPPED FOR THE NUMEROUS RED LIGHTS IN DALLAS, MY CAR WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPELLED OUT INTO THE INTERSECTION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT.  AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, AND THE CAR IS A POTENTIAL DEATH TRAP FOR ME AND MY PASSENGERS OR THE VEHICLE I MIGHT HIT BECAUSE OF THE BRAKE FAILURE AND SURGE PROBLEM.  THERE WAS A TWO-YEAR LAPSE BETWEEN THE TWO INCIDENTS, WHICH IS WHY THE DEALER COULDN'T TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND FIND THE PROBLEM.
