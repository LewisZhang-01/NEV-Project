OUT OF THE BLUE, THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS APPEARED: ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED, SERVICE STABILITRAK, SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL. IMMEDIATELY MY CAR STARTED RUNNING HORRIBLY (IT DIDN'T WANT TO GO, WAS CHUGGING, AND ALMOST FELT LIKE THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING). I PARKED IT. LATER I STARTED IT AND ALL WARNINGS WERE GONE, BUT THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. . THE NEXT DAY I STARTED IT AND JUST THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. 3RD DAY I STARTED IT, ENGINE LIGHT STILL ON. DROVE IT TO A SHOP,.RIGHT BEFORE I PULLED IN, THE LIGHT TURNED OFF! THEY SCANNED IT ANYWAY & SAID THAT NOTHING CAME UP. THE CAR HAS DRIVEN JUST FINE, NO WARNINGS OR LIGHTS UNTIL 11/25/2020. I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 20MPH, TURNED RIGHT ON A SIDE STREET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF THE EXACT MESSAGES AS BEFORE CAME ON. VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY STARTED RUNNING SLOW AND \"CHUGGING\"AGAIN. I PARKED IT. WHEN I STARTED IT AGAIN LATER, ALL THE SAME MESSAGES WERE STILL THERE. IT'S DEFINITELY SCARY WHEN THIS HAPPENS & SINCE THE 1ST TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS NERVOUS TO DRIVE IT FAR BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE WHEN IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN. I WENT ON A CHEVROLET FORUM & READ  THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE. I WAS VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT. I PUT IN MY VIN & IT STATED THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS. SO I CALLED GM THIS MORNING. THE REP SAID THEY'RE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, BUT THERE IS NOT A RECALL FOR IT. SHE THEN SAID THAT IT WOULD'VE COVERED BY SPECIAL WARRANTY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS UNAVAILABLE AS OF APRIL 2019! HER ADVICE WAS TO TAKE IT TO A CERTIFIED DEALERSHIP AND HAVE IT CHECKED AND FIXED SOON FOR MY SAFETY! I ASKED WHY THERE ISN'T A RECALL, IF IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE AND SHE SAID I COULD TALK TO A CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP AND MAYBE THEY COULD DO SOMETHING FOR ME. PLEASE HELP!",

I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR SINCE ITS PURCHASE UNTIL NOVEMBER 29TH.  WHILE EN ROUTE TO EMORY, TEXAS, MY CAR STARTED DISPLAYING \"ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED\" AND \"SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL\" MESSAGES.  ABOUT 99% OF THE WAY THERE, I SUDDENLY GOT A LURCH AND MY CAR SLOWED DOWN, WITH STEERING AND BRAKING NOT WORKING.  I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CAR OFF THE HIGHWAY SAFELY BUT HAD TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP MY VEHICLE AND GET IT TURNED OFF.  I TRIED REPEATEDLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES TO GET IT GOING AGAIN, BUT IT WOULD NOT START.  AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, THE CAR RESTARTED NORMALLY AND HAS PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY SINCE.  HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED.  I'VE HAD A GARAGE PULL AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  THE ERROR CODES THAT WERE PULLED ARE P2122 AND P2138 ,REGARDING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR.  I'VE RESEARCHED THIS AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN FROM MY RESEARCH.

I DID LOOK ONLINE ONLY TO FIND TONS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND I ALSO HAD MULTIPLE FRIENDS WHO SAID NEARLY EVERY IMPALA LIKE MINE THEY HAD BEEN IN MADE THAT SAME NOISE, WOW! SERIOUSLY?  BUT ME BEING THE CHEVY LOVER, I JUST SAW IT AS A MINOR ISSUE MAYBE MISSED IN PRODUCTION BUT NOT REALLY A SAFETY HAZARD. THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER THAT SEEMS TO HAVE WENT AWAY BUT NOW IT TAKES ABOUT 2 MINUTES TO GET THE AC TO SWITCH FROM DEFROST TO BLOWING OUT OF THE DASH VENTS. YOU CAN STILL HEAR IT ON, BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY START BLOWING FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES.  STILL, NOT A BIG DEAL. THEN I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 15MPH(NEAR A SCHOOL)  WHEN A LOW OIL PRESSURE POWER OFF ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WENT OFF QUICKLY, I PULLED OVER AND CUT THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON, NO MORE ISSUES. A FEW DAYS LATER MY SERVICE AIR BAG LIGHT STARTED COMING ON RANDOMLY, HMM, SO IF THAT LIGHT IS ON WILL MY AIR BAGS DEPLOY IF NEEDED? NOT SURE... THEN I GET ALARMS THAT SOMEONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WAS NOT BUCKLED IN, BUT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. THEN MY CAR STARTS CUTTING OFF RANDOMLY WHILE I'M DRIVING. THIS MORNING I BACKED OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND IT JUST CUT OFF LEAVING ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH NO WAY FOR OTHER CARS TO GET AROUND ME.... IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE IF I WAS PULLING OUT AND ANOTHER CAR SPED AROUND THE CORNER.  THEN THERE IS A RECALL NOTICE SENT TO ME STATING I SHOULD REMOVE EVERYTHING FROM MY KEY DUE TO IGNITION FAILURE RECALL. I SAW ON CBS YOU COULD REQUEST A FREE LOANER VEHICLE UNTIL PARTS CAME IN BUT THE DEALER ONLY OFFERED ME A RENTAL AT 300/WK.WOW, THANKS GM FOR CARING ABOUT OUR SAFETY.  *TR",

SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE SAYS THAT IT IS COMMON IN IMPALAS BUT YET I HAVE NOT SEEN A RECALL. I DON'T HAVE THE $450 TO FIX AND IT IS RATHER EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU CAR POOL AS IT IS VERY LOUD AND LAST APPROXIMATELY 30SECONDS TO 45 SECONDS. I HAVE ALSO HAD LEAKS EVERY TIME IT RAINS OR WE GO TO THE CAR WASH. WATER SEEMS TO BE COMING IN FROM THE FRAME BY THE WINDSHIELD ON BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER ROOF AREA. IT RUNS DOWN AND COMES OUT BY THE BRAKE ON DRIVER SIDE AND FUSE BOX ON PASSENGER SIDE. I THOUGHT THIS WATER WAS AFFECTING MY POWER LOCKS AS IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE HAD ISSUE WITH OUR DOOR LOCKS NOT OPENING.

THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE THAT GM REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE. IN THIS INSTANCE I HAD MY DAUGHTER IN THE CAR - I ALSO LOST THE POWER BRAKES. I HAVE BEEN TO TWO CHEVROLET DEALERS AND A BUICK DEALER BECAUSE THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. THEY REPLACED MY THROTTLE BODY, OIL SENSOR, BATTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE AND CHARGED ME OVER $2000 FOR THE THREE VISITS AND I AM STILL EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND HAD THE WIRING HARNESS CHANGED AND HAD SEVERAL DIAGNOSTICS DONE. AFTER ALL THIS THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. I NORMALLY DON'T WRITE LETTERS BUT, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND MANY OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING BASED ON THE MESSAGE BOARDS I HAVE READ. MY CONCERN IS THAT GM REFUSED TO HELP OR ISSUE A RECALL. MY FEAR IS THAT SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED BEFORE GM ANSWERS FOR THIS. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR GM. MY HOPE IS THAT SOMEONE FINALLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED. IN MY LAST COMMUNICATION WITH GM - I WAS TOLD TO TAKE MY CAR TO A DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC AT MY OWN EXPENSE. SO, BASICALLY I AM ON MY OWN AND THEY OFFERED TO DO NOTHING. JUST NOT RIGHT!  *TR",

THE TRAFFIC AHEAD OF ME BEGAN SLOWING AND I BEGAN TO SLOW BY STEADY LIGHT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. MY BRAKES HEATED UP FAST AND I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT BREAKS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO THE ROTORS FEELING AS THOUGH THEY WERE WARPED AND THE FRONT END STARTED VIBRATING. I DOWN SHIFTED TO 3RD. GEAR BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SLOW ME ENOUGH SO I DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND AND THIS STILL WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A DOWNHILL SPEED TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO USE THE BRAKES. FINALLY I SHIFTED TO !ST GEAR TO MAINTAIN THE SAFE SPEED THAT I NEEDED.  THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE THAT THE CAR FREEWHEELS SO EXCELLENT THAT EVEN ON LOWER GRADES AS EXPERIENCED IN THE CAROLINAS IN OCTOBER WHEN WE WERE THERE THE CAR IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GEAR DOWN SO AS NOT TO OVERHEAT THE BRAKES WHEN TRYING TO MAINTAIN POSTED SPEEDS IN MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY.  I DISCUSSED THIS WITH SOLOMON CHEVROLET IN DOTHAN WHERE I GET THE CAR SERVICED AND  THE DEALER FROM WHOM I PURCHASED THE CAR. THEY HAD NO SUGGESTIONS BUT ASSURED ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO DEALERSHIP WISE TO HELP ME.

CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER   PO BOX 33170  DETROIT, MI 48232-5170    [XXX]    SEPT. 23, 2010    RE: WARRANTY DECEPTION ( VEHICLE 2009 IMPALA)     THIS VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY WITH ODOMETER READING OF 27,000 MILES.  A STUD BROKE OFF THE RT REAR WHEEL AND THE LARRY GREEN SERVICE DEPT.IN COTTONWOOD, ARIZONA REFUSED TO REPAIR IT UNDER THE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. THEY CLAIMED IT WAS SHEARED OFF BY WHOMEVER ROTATED THE TIRES LAST. MY CLAIM WAS THAT THE TIRES WERE NEVER ROTATED AND THE STUD BROKE. I ALSO CLAIM THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE NO MATTER WHEN AND IF THE TIRES WERE ROTATED AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE A STUD MAY BREAK BY ROAD IMPACT.  IF IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT THE STUD IS DEFECTIVE IT MAY RESULT IN A MASSIVE RECALL. HOW MUCH TORQUE IS REQUIRED TO TWIST OFF A STUD WITH A STANDARD WRENCH? THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THE STUD DIDN'T COME FROM THE FACTORY DEFECTIVE. THAT IS AN ASSUMPTION. ( OF COURSE WITHOUT TESTING THE STUD IT IS UNKNOWN.) WITH THAT LOGIC ANYTHING THAT BREAKS CAN BE EXCUSED AS AN EXISTING CAUSE. THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY IS DECEPTIVE. IF AUTOMOBILE PARTS NEVER BREAK THE JUNK YARDS WOULD BE EMPTY!   GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE THERE IS A FATALITY IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT OR NOT!   WHAT LARRY GREEN HAS LOST IS THE GOOD WILL OF A KOREAN VET AND PERHAPS MANY OTHER VETS THAT MAY HEAR OF THIS.
