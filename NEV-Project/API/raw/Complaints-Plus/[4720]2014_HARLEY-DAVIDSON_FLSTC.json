I TOOK THE BIKE TO THE DEALER, AND THEY SAID THE BIKE WAS PERFECT, ALIGNMENT WAS PERFECT, EVEN THE TIRE WEAR WAS PERFECT AND THAT SOMETIMES, BIKES JUST DO THAT. I DON'T BUY THAT. THEY REFUSED TO HELP ME WITH IT, SO I CONTACTED DUNLOP, WHO ALSO REFUSED TO HELP. SO, I BOUGHT A DUNLOP AMERICAN ELITE. I WANT TO STAY AMERICAN MADE. I HAVE A LITTLE OVER 7000 MILES ON IT, AND NOW IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE TIRES. I HAVE RUN DUNLOP'S ON OTHER BIKES FOR YEARS AND GOTTEN ANY WHERE FROM 10K-12K MILES AND THAT IS WITH BURN OUTS! TO DATE, I HAVE NEVER DONE A BURN OUT ON THIS HD. I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER FOLKS WHO HAVE THE SAME BIKE, AND THEIRS GET GOOD TIRE MILEAGE, AND I HAVE TALKED TO OTHERS WHO HAVE VARIOUS OTHER MODELS OF HD'S AND A COUPLE OF THEM HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. IT IS IN THE BIKE SETUP. SOMEWHERE. I LOVE MY BIKE, BUT I DON'T HAVE 300 BUCKS TO SHELL OUT EVERY FEW MONTHS BECAUSE THE TIRE IS SLICK. MY FRONT TIRE IS STILL THE FACTORY TIRE AND WILL STILL PASS STATE INSPECTION. I DON'T GET IT. LESS THAN 13K MILES, AND ALREADY NEED A 3RD TIRE!",
