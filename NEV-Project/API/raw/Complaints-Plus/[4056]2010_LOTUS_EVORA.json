ENGINERING/DESIGN DEFECT CAUSES ENGINE HEAT TO BOIL HYDRAULIC CLUTCH FLUID, LEADING TO HYDRAULIC CLUTCH FLUID DECAY OVER TIME, LEADING TO FAILURE OF MASTER CLUTCH CYLINDER AND CLUTCH PEDAL STOCK IN DOWN POSITION WHILE DRIVING. THIS ULTIMATELY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO NEUTRAL OR SHIFT GEARS.  IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY IN FOURTH GEAR, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  LUCKY FOR ME IT HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT.  THE CAR WAS IN FIRST GEAR AT 5 MPH AND THE CLUTCH PEDAL WAS STUCK IN THE DOWN POSITION.  I COULD NOT SHIFT GEARS OR GET THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL.  I HAD TO STALL THE CAR TO STOP IT.  THE CAR DEALER IS REPAIRING IT NOW WITH A RETRO FIT DEVICE TO PREVENT ENGINE HEAT FROM BOILING THE BYDRAULIC CLUTHC FLUID.  I THINK A REALL IS NECESSARY BECASUE THIS PROBLEMS HAPPENS TO OTHER LOTUS EVORA OWNERS AS I HAVE HEARD FROM THE LOCAL MECHANIC AND THE OWNER BLOGS ON THE INTERNET.",
