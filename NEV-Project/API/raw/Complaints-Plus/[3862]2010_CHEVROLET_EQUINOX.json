I have always made sure to do all the proper maintenance on this car. Now I am out of warranty and looking at around $6000 more in repairs again. I have been told by several car places that have looked at this car that  there have been many problems with this car\u2018s engine. Engine light repeatedly goes on and when checked and fix goes off and goes back on within a week again. I have talk to GMC and they said because I am no longer under warranty nothing can be done. I feel like this car needs to be either replaced or the engine needs to be replaced by them. This last time has made me very worried since my car completely died in the middle of a busy highway.",

Early this week my car had been warming up for nearly 30 minutes and I put it in drive and it jerk harder then normal. I just thought it was because it went from hot to cold outside overnight that that was the problem. Though as I was driving down the street my check engine light came on and the vehicle was stalling in between 35-40 mph. So I got it check out and the code said that it was a transmission shift solenoid. I then took it to Chevy to make sure that, that was the issues and the dealership Penske Chevrolet confirmed that it was and that many of the Equinox\u2019s, cruzes, and traverses from the year 2009 until 2019 Health exact same issue and that several people did the complaint form in their dealership I did research online and it\u2019s true many people complain about this issue but I think they don\u2019t know where to go to file a proper complaint. I think that this problem not being recalled is absurd because it\u2019s costing people nearly 4, five, $6000 because of this issue when if many and I do mean many people are having this issue then chevy needs to fix this.",

TO REPAIR IT, THE MORE APPROPRIATE OPTION IS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION/MOTOR ASSEMBLY AND THAT PART IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, AROUND $300.

I THOUGHT I HAD MADE A GOOD CHOICE BUYING THIS CHEVY EQUINOX SUV, LIKING IT A LOT, BUT, NOW, I AM LOOKING TO GET ANOTHER TOYOTA, HONDA, NISSAN OR MAZDA AND TRADE THIS ONE IN! I HAVE CALLED A CERTIFIED CHEVY DEALER TO HAVE AN INSPECTION AND DIAGNOSTIC DONE ON THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2018. AFTER THAT, I WILL CALL THE CHEVY RECALL NUMBER FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE! THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY HAZARD! I COULD NOT SEE! I COULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND RAN OFF THE ROAD, OR WORSE YET, BEEN KILLED OR KILLED SOMEONE ELSE! I HOPE I CAN GET REIMBURSED THE COST OF THIS REPAIR!",

THE NEXT DAY WHILE DRIVING TWO MORE CODES CAME ON INCLUDING P0700 AND P182E (I HAVE ON OBD READER). AT THAT MOMENT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RUN BUT THE TRANSMISSION APPEARED TO GO INTO A NEUTRAL CONDITION. THIS OCCURED WHILE DRIVING @ 30 MPH. I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET. AT THAT POINT  I COULD REV THE ENGINE BUT THEIR WAS NO FORWARD DRIVE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE. AFTER LETTING THE CAR SIT IN AN OFF CONDITION FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, I WAS THE ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND DRIVE HOME. I THEN BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS AS THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THIS ERROR CODE. THE DEALER THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN HAD APPARENTLY STRETCHED AND WAS CAUSING THE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR TO TRIP. I WAS TOLD THAT THE REPAIR WAS VERY EXTENSIVE AND OF COURSE COSTLY AS THE MOTOR HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE STRETCHED TIMING CHAIN. I STARTED RESEARCHING THE ERROR CODE ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS A SERVICE BULLETIN (SB-10052863-6133) PUBLISHED IN 2014 BY GENERAL MOTORS DETAILING A NEWER TIMING CHAIN KIT THAT WAS RELEASED TO ADDRESS THIS STRETCHING ISSUE. SEVERAL GENERAL MOTORS MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN THE BULLETIN AS THEY ALL UTILIZE THE SAME V6 3.0 LITER ENGINE AS WHAT IS IN MY EQUINOX. MY MAJOR GRIPE IS THAT THE CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE TIMING CHAIN SOONER, BEFORE THE WARRANTY PERIOD EXPIRED. GENERAL MOTORS HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH TIMING CHAIN FAILURES IN THEIR 4 CYLINDER 2.4 LITER ENGINES AND AN OFFICIAL RECALL WAS DONE FOR THAT ENGINE. I FEEL THIS SAME CONDITION IS NOW STARTED TO AFFECT THE V6 3.0 LITER AS WELL.",

THEN I FIND OUT WHILE BROWSING AROUND MY ONSTAR ACCOUNT THAT THERE ARE 2 EXTENDED WARRANTIES FOR THE TIMING CHAIN. WHY DIDN'T THE DEALER KNOW THAT? NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AGAIN BECAUSE I'M 188 MILES PAST THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I CALLED A REPUTABLE TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP TO GET A QUOTE FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY REPAIRED 2 OF THE SAME VEHICLE LAST WEEK AND CANNOT GET A GM TRANSMISSION DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ON NATIONAL BACKORDER BECAUSE GM KNOWS THEY ARE FAULTY. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS. GM SHOULD HAVE TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER GM VEHICLE.",

MY WIFE'S 2010 EQUINOX ISN'T LISTED IN THE TSB!!! I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL. I'VE CALLED GM TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND THEY WILL HEAR NOTHING OF IT AND ARE TELLING ME THEY WILL NOT COVER THE EXPENSE. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME HOW THEY ADMIT FAULT AND PICK OF THE COST OF THE EXACT SAME REPAIR ON OTHER GM MODELS BUT THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIR ON MY VEHICLE FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE AND I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE HAVING THIS ISSUE AT A HIGH SPEED, LUCKILY MY WIFE WAS ONLY DRIVING IN TOWN. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, THE VEHICLE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 55,000 MILES ON IT AND GM IS TELLING ME THE 5 YEAR 100,000 MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY DOESN'T EVEN COVER THIS! HOW MUCH SENSE DOES THAT MAKE? THE POWERTRAIN IS THE MEAT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH CANNOT BE UTILIZED IF THE THROTTLE BODY IS ACTING UP BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS KICKED INTO REDUCED POWER MODE!

DRIVING WITHOUT FUNCTIONING DEFROST SYSTEM CAN DECREASE VISIBILITY AND COULD RESULT IN CRASH WITHOUT WARNING. CORRECT BY REPLACING COMPUTER MODULE IN CENTER INSTRUMENT PANEL\" MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT RECALL, BUT IT IS THE EXACT PROBLEM I AM HAVING. THE COMPUTER MODULE IS BAD. WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET THIS CAR FIXED UNDER THE WARRANTY? I BELIEVE MY VIN SHOULD BE INCLUDED, BUT NO ONE AT CHEVROLET WILL HELP ME WITHOUT CHARGING ME A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. I WOULDN'T MIND IF THE VENTS WEREN'T WORKING, BUT THE DEFROSTER NEEDS TO WORK AND IT ISN'T A WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE.

IF CAR STOPPED RUNNING ON INTERSTATE FOR NO REASON, BRAKES, ALARM, AIR BAGS WOULD BE INOPERATIVE. THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO GM/CHEVROLET ABOUT 6 TIMES, A LATE AS YESTERDAY WHEN THEY DEMAND COST OF KEYS TO REPAIR PROBLEM.AT TIMES WE HAVE GONE INTO STORES AND HEARD THE ALARM GO OFF WITH NO ONE AROUND. THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OF CHEVROLET TO MEET RECALL.  PLEASE ADVISE AS TO HOW THIS CAN BE RESOLVED. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE KEY SYSTEM AND THE KEY AND IGNITION AND ENGINE ARE ALLINKED AND ARE FAULTY WITH PROBLEMS YET TOBE REVEALED. CURRENT MILEAGE, 60,700 TOTAL MILEAGE.  *TR",
