I PULLED OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY AND CALLED MY SPOUSE. WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE MY SPOUSE AND I DISCUSSED WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SINCE NO TIRE WAS BLOWN. I PICKED UNDER THE VEHICLE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING LEAKING OR DAMAGE. I GOT BACK IN THE CAR WITH MY SPOUSE STILL ON THE PHONE AND STARTED THE VEHICLE TO CHECK DUMMY LIGHTS ON THE - NOTHING THERE. I STARTED THE CAR AND KEPT DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD I COULD HEAR AIR COMING THROUGH MY SUNROOF. LUCKILY THE MOON ROOF SLIDING DOOR WAS CLOSED SO NO GLASS HAD ENTERED THE INSIDE. BUT COULD TELL THAT THE SUNROOF WAS SHATTERED. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WITH NO ONE NEAR ME IN FRONT OR BEHIND OR PASSING FOR A GOOD  200 TO 300 YD BEFORE I PULLED OVER. IT WAS A TYPICAL FALL DAY LIKE SEMI OVERCAST BUT IN THE SIXTIES AND NOT WINDY. I WAS  IN SHOCK THAT THE SUNROOF HAD SHATTERED THERE WAS NO CONSTRUCTION NO DEBRIS NO BADD WEATHER WASN'T HOT OR COLD IT WAS JUST CRAZY AND SCARY.

I CALLED THE LEXUS NATIONAL HELPLINE ON 12 MAY TO SEEK A SECOND OPINION AS I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES AND ALL HAVE HELD THEIR PLACE ON AN INCLINE. I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CONTACTED BY THE LEXUS GX SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT SHORTLY.     ON 24 MAY I CALLED THE NATIONAL HELPLINE A SECOND TIME AND WAS TOLD AFTER A THIRTY MINUTE WAIT THAT THE GX SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WOULD CALL ME BACK.
