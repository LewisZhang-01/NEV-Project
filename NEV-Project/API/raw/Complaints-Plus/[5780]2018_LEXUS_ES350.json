AS SOON AS THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I SAW THE VEHICLES IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME PROCEED TO MOVE FORWARD, AND THE DRIVER IN FRONT OF ME TOOK HIS FOOT OFF OF HIS BRAKES, SO I THOUGHT HE WAS MOVING FORWARD AS WELL. SO THEN I DECIDED TO ACCELERATE TO ABOUT 5-10 MPH. BY THE TIME I REALIZED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME WASN'T MOVING FORWARD, MY CAR HIT HIS TRAIL-HITCH\" (NOT HIS BACK BUMPER) AND THE FRONT OF MY CAR WAS DAMAGED, BUT I COULD DRIVE IT FROM THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT. THE BRAKE ASSIST OF MY 2018 LEXUS ES350 DID NOT ENGAGE. I THINK THE BRAKE ASSIST FUNCTION ON MY VEHICLE WAS FAULTY AND IT SHOULD'VE BEEN RECALLED AND FIXED, AS IT WOULD'VE STOPPED ME FROM GETTING INTO A CAR ACCIDENT IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD IT ENGAGED AND WORKED PROPERLY.",
