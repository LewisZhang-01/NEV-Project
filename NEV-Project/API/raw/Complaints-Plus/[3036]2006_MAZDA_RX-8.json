THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED ME AND SAID IT WAS THE ENGINE AND THE VEHICLE NEEDS A NEW ENGINE.     THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY 63,545 MILES ON IT, AND SINCE THEN, I DROVE ONLY 4,344 MILES IN THE SIX MONTHS.     I ASKED THE DEALER, FINANCE DEPARTMENT FOR A WARRANTY/EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE FINANCE MANAGER SAID, THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES. I DID NOT RECEIVE A WHITE (SQUARE) PIECE OF PAPER OR BOOKLET FOR WARRANTY INFORMATION OR \"AS IS\" INFORMATION.     NOW, I AM PAYING $8500.00 FOR A NEW ENGINE.    THEN, I SEARCHED ONLINE FOR ANY SAFETY ISSUES OR RECALLS ON VINRCL.SAFECAR.GOV.  I FOUND OUT THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS A DEVASTATING SAFETY RECALL INVOLVING THE AIRBAGS.
