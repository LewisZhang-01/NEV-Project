I opened the pump cover and saw a crack in the pump filter housing(is in the picture).I reported it to the dealer(honda Hamilton NJ) but they dismissed me saying it was not their problem because they did not replace the part. I reported it to honda usa where after three weeks they told me the same thing. On their website it clearly states \"HONDA WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FUEL FILTER SET ON THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY...\". My question is why they don't replace the filter housing when it says it's a fire hazard. Thank You",

I HAVE A 08 ODYSSEY THAT'S HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM BUT UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND IT GOT SO BAD I WAS TOLD I NEED A NEW MOTOR. I WENT TO HAVE AN OIL CHANGE AT THE HONDA DEALERSHIP BACK IN NOVEMBER AND LAST MONTH WAS TOLD THAT THE OIL WAS BONE DRY. HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE IF IT'S NOT BURNING OR LEAKING OIL? HONDA KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM YET REFUSED ME ANY HELP AND TOLD ME I HAVE TO BRING IT IN FOR A DIAGNOSTIC THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ON TOP OF REPLACING THE MOTOR ON MY OWN. THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS I FOUND ONLINE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME VEHICLE AND SAME PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY THEY KNOW ABOUT IT AND ARE KEEPING UP WITH HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ADD OIL, WHERE I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND APPARENTLY I WAS DRIVING IT WITH NO OIL FOR ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND ITS NOT FAIR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE. I'M A SINGLE MOM, 2 SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS, I DON'T HAVE OVER 3000 TO REPAIR A MOTOR THAT BROKE BECAUSE OF A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THIS NEEDS TO BE HEARD AND WE NEED TO GET HONDA TO DO A RECALL AND FIX THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. HONDA IS A CROOKED DEALERSHIP AND DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. NOW I'M SITTING HERE STUCK WITH A VAN WHICH I PURCHASED WITH MY SON'S DISABILITY MONEY BTW, WITH A BAD MOTOR CAUSE OF A MISTAKE HONDA MADE WHEN MAKING THESE VANS. PLEASE GET MY STORY OUT THERE, LET THIS BE HEARD. I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME DO SOMETHING. THIS IS SAD AND WRONG AND I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. I'M ALSO GOING TO CONTACT THE BBB AND THE LOCAL ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE. THEY'VE ALREADY HAD LAWSUITS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM BUT FOR THE HONDA ACCORD, NOW WE NEED TO START ONE FOR THE HONDA ODYSSEY",

I HAD A LARGE CART OF GROCERIES AND IT WAS RAINING, SO I RAISED IT UP WITH ONE HAND, BUT WHEN I TURNED TO GET MORE GROCERIES, I EXPECTED IT TO STAY AND IT DROPPED DOWN. FORTUNATELY, I DID NOT HAVE MY CHILDREN WITH ME, SO I COULD PUT THE REST OF THE GROCERIES IN THE SEAT AREA AND DEAL WITH IT LATER. IT HAS NOT RESOLVED, SO IT WAS NOT A \"RAIN\" ISSUE.    IN THE WEEK THAT HAS PASSED, I HAVE DONE SOME OF RESEARCH. I FOUND THAT HONDA DID INDEED HAVE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM HTTP://WWW-ODI.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/ACMS/CS/JAXRS/DOWNLOAD/DOC/UCM416791/RCAK-12V062-3793.PDF  HOWEVER, WHEN I CALLED MY HONDA DEALER, *MY* VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHICH MODELS ARE BY THE OFFICIAL NOTICES. THEY QUOTED ME $276 TO FIX IT. I HAVE DISCOVERED THIS IS VERY EASY TO FIX - $50 FOR THE STRUTS, A FLATHEAD SCREWDRIVER, AND LADDER TO PROP OPEN THE TAILGATE AND EVEN A 115 LB WOMAN CAN FIX THEM.       HOWEVER, WHY AREN'T ALL 2008 HONDA ODYSSEYS IN THIS RECALL? HAD MY CHILDREN BEEN HELPING ME OR HAD I BEEN HALF IN THE VAN WHEN THE STRUTS SUDDENLY FAILED, ANY OF US COULD HAVE BEEN BADLY INJURED OR KILLED BY THE DEAD WEIGHT OF THAT DOOR. FOR NOW I WILL ORDER THE STRUTS AND FIX THEM AS SOON AS I CAN SINCE I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO DUKE IT OUT WITH HONDA.  *TR",

IN A MATTER OF SECONDS, OUR SPEED DECREASED FROM 50 TO 25-30.  OUR SEATBELTS ALL LOCKED AS WE WERE LUNGED FORWARD.  THERE WAS A CAR DIRECTLY BEHIND US, WHO HAD TO SWERVE INTO ANOTHER LANE TO AVOID REAR ENDING US.  IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, HOWEVER NO ONE DID.  THIS HAPPEN 3 OR 4 MORE TIMES WITHIN A 5-7 MINUTE TIME FRAME, SO WE IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  I IMMEDIATELY GOOGLED THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION FOR 2007 AND 2008 ODYSSEYS FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  I READ THAT THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE VEHICLE STABILITY SYSTEM, SO WE PRESSED THE VSA OFF BUTTON AND DROVE HOME AT A SPEED OF 30 MPH IN CASE IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  NO FURTHER SPONTANEOUS BRAKING OCCURRED ONCE THE VSA WAS OFF.  I TOOK THE CAR INTO HAMILTON HONDA THIS MORNING AND SPOKE TO SERVICE MANAGER.  THEY ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE VAN.  I AM WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THEY FIND.  *TR",

IN THE SPRING OF 2010, I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM: AFTER MAKING A TURN (RIGHT OR LEFT),DURING ACCELERATION, THE ODYSSEY'S BRAKES WILL AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGE, IMMEDIATELY SLOWING THE VAN DOWN. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE VEHICLE DECELERATES FROM 55MPH TO 20MPH IN SECONDS, ENGAGING THE SHOULDER HARNESS OF OUR SEAT-BELTS.   OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST SEVEN TO TEN TIMES AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND IN VARIOUS SEASONS OF THE YEAR.  I HAVE RETURNED THE VAN TO HONDA AT LEAST FOUR TIMES. BECAUSE AN INDICATOR LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON AND BECAUSE THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, OUR SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT HONDA TELLS US THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  IN NOVEMBER 2012,  HOWEVER, THE COMPUTER REGISTERED A VSA CODE AFTER ONE OF SEVERAL BRAKING INCIDENTS. HONDA THEN REPLACED THE VSA MODULE IN THE STEERING COLUMN. THAT SEEMED TO HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO, WHEN WE HAD YET ANOTHER SUDDEN HALT WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC.  WHEN MY WIFE TOOK THE VAN TO HONDA, THE YOUNG SERVICE MAN BLAMED THE VSA MALFUNCTION ON TIRE WEAR AND THEN TRIED TO SELL HER A NEW SET OF  TIRES. HONDA DID RE-CALIBRATE THE VSA AGAIN DURING THIS VISIT. TODAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2013 THE BRAKES LOCKED DOWN AGAIN, THIS TIME, WHEN ACCELERATING AT A SLOWER SPEED. IT HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF OUR HONDA DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE READ ONLINE OF IDENTICAL INCIDENTS.

THIS HAS BEEN CAUSING A HUGE PROBLEM AND SAFETY CONCERN ESPECIALLY COMING OFF FROM A PARALLEL PARKING BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF MANUEVERING BEFORE I CAN GET OFF FROM THE SPOT AND INVOLVES A GREAT EFFORT ESPECIALLY IN AN INCLINE POSITION. RECENTLY ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THE SAME ISSUE CAME IN ABOUT THE ENGINE AND THE OIL LIGHT SHOWING UP, OIL LEVEL WAS LOW AGAIN BUT DOESN'T NOTICED ANY LEAKING. I DID SOME SEARCH AND I HAVE SEEN A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE ABOUT THE ERROR CODE P3400 AND P3497 WHICH IS VERY SCARY AND VERY SIGNIFICANT TO THE LIFE SPAN OF THE ENGINE.

ALL MY VEHICLE SERVICING INCLUDING EVERY RECOMMENDED OIL CHANGE AND VARIOUS LEVELS OF SERVICE HAVE BEEN AT HONDA DEALERSHIPS.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL MANUFACTURING / MECHANICAL DEFECT AND COULD ALSO CAUSE SAFETY ISSUES GOING FORWARD.  *TR",

I BELIEVED HIM BECAUSE I LOOKED UP HONDA ENGINE PROBLEMS AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  THE NEXT DAY THEY CALLED AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE TENSIONER AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I GET THE TIMING BELT CHANGED. I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS COMING TO GET MY CAR BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  CARLOS CALLED ME BACK AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD FIX THE TENSIONER AT NO CHARGE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THEY CAUSED ME.  THEY ENDED UP REBUILDING THE ENGINE. NEW ENGINE IS CONSUMING A LOT OF OIL. DEALER DOESN'T WANT TO FIX PROBLEM. I HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION.  *TR",

I ASKED HONDA TO BLEED THE BRAKES AND RE-APPLY THE SEALS CALLED OUT IN THE RECALL. HONDA REFUSED TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE OR APPLY THE RECALL A SECOND TIME (AS A RECALL CONDITION). HONDA DID RECOMMEND THAT I PAY FOR A BRAKE INSPECTION AND SERVICE.        HONDA'S RECALL REPAIR WAS INSUFFICIENT AND HAS LEFT THE VEHICLE IN THE SAME DANGEROUS CONDITION OF LEAKING AIR INTO THE BRAKES AS IT WAS BEFORE THE RECALL. I PLAN TO BLEED THE BRAKES MYSELF RATHER THAN PAY HONDA A SMALL FORTUNE TO DO SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE DOING FREE OF CHARGE FOR THERE FAULTY DESIGN. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF NHTSA WOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THE VEHICLE TO DOCUMENT THE RECURRING PROBLEM, BEFORE I BLEED THE BRAKES.       IN THE FUTURE I WOULD URGE THE NHTSA TO HOLD MANUFACTURERS LIABLE TO EITHER IMPLEMENT A REAL FIX, SUCH AS A NEW VSA MODULATOR THAT DOESN'T LEAK OR THAT THEY SHOULD REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURER TO APPLY THEIR 'BAND-AID FIX'  RECALL OF BLEEDING THE BRAKES AND ADDING SEALS AS MANY TIMES AS THE CUSTOMER REQUESTS.

THE THIRD TIME THE DEALER SAID THE SOFT PEDAL WAS \"NORMAL\" DESPITE THE FACT THAT BLEEDING THE BRAKES REVERSED THE PROBLEM. NOW THE VAN WITH RECURRING BAD BRAKES PROBLEM HAS A FAILED VSA MODULE, THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. THE MODULE NOW NEEDS REPLACEMENT AT A COST OVER $1400. THIS IS A FAULTY PART WHICH THE DEALER OR HONDA DID NOT CORRECT.  I HAVE SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WHEN PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR BARELY STOPPED THE VEHICLE BEFORE AN ACCIDENT OCCURRED. AFTER SEVERAL FRIGHTENING NEAR ACCIDENT INCIDENCES I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE VAN AS THOUGH THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES AND INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCES. THE FAILED VSA MODULE ALSO AFFECTS STEERING THE VEHICLE. IT WORKS IN THE BACKGROUND AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE STEERING HAS BEEN AFFECTED.  I KNOW MINIVANS ARE HARD TO STOP. MY DODGE CARAVAN HAD A LONG STOPPING DISTANCE AND WORE THE BRAKE PADS DOWN IN 15,000 TO 20,000 MILES. THERE NEVER WAS A SOFT PEDAL PROBLEM WITH THOSE BRAKES. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO BUY A VAN THAT HAD \"GOOD BRAKES\" BUT AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS ODYSSEY DEFECT HAS JEOPARDIZED MYSELF, MY FAMILY AND OTHERS BY REPEATED PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE FUNCTIONS AND HONDA'S INABILITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS RECURRING PROBLEM OR TO FIX THE ISSUE BY REPLACING THE INTEGRAL BUT FAULTY PART OF THE VEHICLES SAFETY SYSTEMS. TAKING THE AIR OUT OF A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WITHOUT PREVENTING RECURRENCE IS IRRESPONSIBLE. PLACING CUSTOMERS LIVES AT RISK IS SHAMEFUL.  *TR",

VIN # [XXX]     HONDA CASE # [XXX]     TO ALL CONCERNED,    THIS LETTER IS TO EXPLAIN THE EVENTS THAT HAS LED TO ME NOW HAVING TO TAKE THIS ISSUE TO A MORE ELEVATED LEVEL.    AT THE END OF OCTOBER OF 2008 MY WIFE, MOTHER AND 3 CHILDREN WENT TO COGGIN HONDA  LOCATED AT  11051  S. ORANGE BLOSSOM TRAIL, ORLANDO, FLA.  32837  (TEL. 407-851-9118)  TO LOOK AT THE ODYSSEY MINIVANS.  WE WERE APPROACHED BY SALES & LEASING CONSULTANT CHESTER HEATH: CELL [XXX] (NO LONGER THERE) AND HE SHOWED US AROUND AND MET WITH FINANCE MANAGER FRANCIS ROSARIO : CELL [XXX] WHO FINANCED US.    ABOUT A WEEK AFTER DRIVING IT AROUND I STARTED TO NOTICE THAT IT WAS MAKING A NOISE WHEN BRAKING, A HARD GRINDING NOISE (STILL MAKING THIS NOISE TO THIS DAY).  I ALSO NOTICED THAT IT WAS MAKING A CLICKING  SOUND WHEN MAKING RADIUS TURNS (SINCE FIXED BY CLASSIC HONDA BY FIXING THE FRONT AXLE IN NOVEMBER 2009) . ALSO THERE WAS AND STILL IS A RATTLE BY THE STEERING WHEEL. MY MAIN CONCERN HOWEVER IS THE BRAKING NOISE WHICH  AT THE BEGINNING WOULD COME AND GO. IT NOW DOES IT ALMOST EVERY TIME I BRAKE. THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM, IT COMES AND GOES.     SO I TOLD MY WIFE ABOUT THE NOISE THAT THE CAR MADE AND SHE SUGGESTED I CALL COGGIN HONDA TO AT LEAST LET IT BE KNOWN ON RECORD ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I THEN CALLED COGGIN THAT WEEK AND THE PERSON I SPOKE TO SAID TO JUST SIMPLY COME BY AND WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT IT. SINCE IT  DID NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT IT WAS A NEW CAR JUST GETTING SETTLED.  SO I PROBABLY WAITED A FEW  MONTHS (ABOUT JAN. 2009) AND THEN IT STARTED TO MAKE THE NOISE ON A CONSTANT  BASIS AND REALIZED THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BROUGHT THE CAR TO COGGIN AND SPOKE WITH SERVICE ADVISOR FRITZ RAY (NO LONGER THERE) AND OF COURSE IT DID NOT MAKE THE NOISE AT THAT TIME AND BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NOISE THEY COULD.

THE BRAKES WERE NOT SLOWING US DOWN MUCH AT ALL AS THE ENGINE RACED ( FOOT WAS OFF THE GAS PEDAL) AND WE NEARLY CRASHED IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PARKING LOT. ( I PUT THE VAN IN NEUTRAL AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE ALONG WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO GET US TO STOP.)  WE TOWED THE CAR TO HONDA & THEY HAD IT FOR FOUR DAYS. I DID NOT WANT IT BACK ! HONDA SAID THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE COMPUTER SENSORS DIDN'T TRACK THE DISTURBANCE. WE ENDED UP PAYING OUT OF OUR OWN POCKET FOR A COMPLETELY NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM TO BE INSTALLED.  ( WE HAVE THE OLD COMPUTER PART.) WE REPORTED THIS TO HONDA. I AM WRITING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE TOYOTA IS NOT THE ONLY CAR WITH AN ACCELERATION PROBLEM ! OUR HONDA DEALER SWEPT IT UNDER THE RUG BUT I AM SURE THERE HAS TO BE OTHER HONDA OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THE LIFE THREATENING SAME ISSUE. *TR",

SEVERAL WEEKS LATER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP HILL INTO THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY, I HAD NO BRAKES AT ALL I COULD NOT EVEN FEEL THE BRAKE PEDDLE. FORTUNATELY IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT. I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A LEFT TURN INTO THE HIGHWAY AND ROLL TO S STOP IN A BUSINESS PARKING LOT. I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE UNTIL I RECOVERED FROM THE FRIGHT. I RESTARTED THE ENGINE TO MOVE AN ACTUAL PARKING PLACE. THEN I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD BRAKES. I ASSUMED THAT BEING NEW TO THE ODYSSEY, THAT I HAD SOME HOW MISSED THE BRAKE PEDDLE AND THAT IS WHY I DID NOT EVEN FEEL IT.    THIRTY THOUSAND MILES LATER WHILE TURNING INTO A PARKING PLACE IN A WAL-MART LOT I THINK THE BRAKES DID THE SAME THING BUT MY SPEED WAS SO SLOW I WAS NOT SURE. I DROVE THIRTY MILES THAT DAY AND HAD NO CONCERN OR PROBLEM. THAT EVENING I RETURNED TO THE SAME STORE AND WAS PARKING IN A REMOTE AREA OF THE LOT AND HAD NO BRAKES. EXACTLY LIKE THE HILL INCIDENT A LONG TIME AGO. I MANAGED TO STEER AWAY FROM EVERYTHING UNTIL I GOT THE ODYSSEY STOPPED. AGAIN I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND UPON RESTARTING HAD BRAKES.    I DROVE VERY FEARFULLY TO THE NEAREST HONDA DEALER AN GOT THERE AT 6AM ONE HOUR BEFORE THEY OPENED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIGHT TRAFFIC.  I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT FRONT RANGE HONDA IN COLORADO SPRINGS, CO; THAT ON AT LEAST TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS I HAD NO BRAKES AT ALL AND AFTER SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING I HAD BRAKES.    THE SERVICE ADVISOR WROTE IT UP AS MY STATING SOFT BRAKE PEDDLE. THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM AND NOT WHAT I STATED.  IS HONDA DOWN PLAYING A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM?    WHILE IN THE SERVICE WAITING AREA I USED MY LAPTOP TO RESEARCH ODYSSEY BRAKE PROBLEMS AND FOUND A GREAT MANY. THEY REPLACED THE ABS MODULE. I AM SHOCKED THAT AN ELECTRONIC COMPONENT CAN HAVE INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS THAT CAN CAUSE COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. *TR",

AFTER TRYING NUMEROUS TIMES TO SECURE TWO OF THE SEATS IN A REAR FACING POSITION, MY HUSBAND AND I HAD TO USE THE ANCHOR STRAP TO KEEP THE SEATS SECURE.  ACCORDING TO THE BOOK THAT COMES WITH THE SEATS, THE ANCHOR IS NOT TO BE USED IN THE REAR FACING POSITION.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IS CERTIFIED IN CAR SEAT INSTALLATION.  THE FIREMAN POINTED OUT TO US THAT THE LATCH BELT ON THE TWO SEATS WILL NOT STAY TIGHT.  AFTER THE LATCHES WERE SECURE AND WE TIGHTENED THE STRAPS, THE FIREMEN WERE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THE SEATS WERE SECURE AND THE BELT WOULD LOOSEN WITH THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE ON THE SEATS.  THEREFORE, THESE SEATS CANNOT BE INSTALLED PROPERLY AND ARE DANGEROUS FOR MY CHILDREN TO RIDE IN AS IS.  I CONTACTED DOREL THIS MORNING, AND ALL THEY COULD OFFER WAS A NEW LATCH BELT FOR THE SEATS WITH PROBLEMS.  I WAS TOLD IT WOULD TAKE TEN BUSINESS DAYS FOR ME TO RECEIVE THE NEW LATCH BELTS.  WHEN I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE WHAT I SHOULD DO IN THE MEAN TIME, I WAS TOLD TO JUST USE THE SEAT BELTS IN THE VEHICLE TO SECURE THE CAR SEATS.  MY QUESTION TO DOREL AND TO YOU IS WHY WOULD I WANT TO JUST USE THE SEAT BELT WHEN THE SEAT IS NOT SECURE AND SHOULD BE USED WITH A LATCH SYSTEM.

NEEDLESS TO SAY MY EFFORTS WERE FUTILE AND I WAS REFERRED TO HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE.    IN JANUARY I FILED A CASE WITH HONDA WHO AFTER ABOUT A WEEK CONTACTED ME AND INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRIS THEY WERE COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. I CERTAINLY CAN NOT HOLD HONDA RESPONSIBLE FOR ROAD DEBRIS DAMAGE SUCH AS A CRACKED WINDSHIELD OR PUNCTURED TIRE. HOWEVER, I STILL HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR POOR DESIGN AND PLACEMENT OF SUCH CRITICAL AND FRAGILE PART IN A PLACE WHERE IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GET HIT BY ROAD DEBRIS.
