        "summary": "This is a safety issue with my 2021 CanAm RT Spyder. When riding up a grade in the mountains and the rpm's decrease, the motorcycle starts to buck, misfire and the the speed rapidly decreases.  Downshifting to a lower gear does not alleviate the problem. My safety was jeopardized by the rapid reduction of speed in traffic putting me at risk of being hit from behind. I just completed a 3,800 mile journey and encountered the issue every time going up a grade that resulted in a drop of rpm's and speed.   The vehicle has not been inspected, but I did discuss the issue with the dealership where I purchased the CanAm. They informed me it is a known issue and the motorcycle computer would resolve the problem as I continued to ride in the mountains.  The issue was never eliminated. There were no warning messages.",
