THIS CONDITION IS GENERALLY BROUGHT ON BY EITHER OF THE FRONT WHEELS HITTING ANY DEVIATION IN THE ROAD SURFACE SUCH AS BRIDGE EXPANSION JOINTS, POTHOLES, ETC. THE CONDITION IS SO BAD THAT IMMEDIATE LOSS OF CONTROL CAN ONLY BE CONTROLLED BY JERKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL OR AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN SPEED, GENERALLY TO 25 MPH.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS CONDITION SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS SINCE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE, MOST RECENTLY ON JULY 12TH WHILE TRAVELING ON THE 57 FREEWAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT 65 MPH. I WAS TRAVELLING IN THE LEFT HAND LANE NEXT TO THE CARPOOL LANE (IN MODERATE TRAFFIC) WHEN I ROLLED OVER A BRIDGE EXPANSION AND THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL  STARTED SHAKING VIOLENTLY AND CAUSING ME TO IMMEDIATELY APPLY MY BRAKES TO REGAIN CONTROL.    THE SEVERITY SEEMS TO BE GREATLY REDUCED WHEN HAULING A SUBSTANTIAL LOAD IN THE TRUCK BED, BUT I DID EXPERIENCE THIS TWICE WHILE HAULING A 20' CARGO TRAILER  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I UNDERSTAND THAT A CLASS ACTION SUIT WAS FILED AGAINST FORD IN JUNE/2019 AND THAT FORD HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS ISSUE WITH OTHER TRUCK OWNERS FILING COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS CONDITION.

I WAS NORTHBOUND ON I-75 IN NORTHERN KY WHEN I WENT OVER A MINOR BUMP, JUST ROUGH PAVEMENT. I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THERE WAS NO OBJECT IN THE ROAD. AFTER THE BUMP THE TRUCK BEGAN STEERING ERRATICALLY, WANDERING, MUCH AS IT HAD 4 DAYS EARLIER WHEN I TOOK IT TO MY FORD DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE FRONT U-JOINTS. I SLOWED DOWN, GOT THE TRUCK UNDER CONTROL, TURNED OFF THE CRUISE CONTROL, AND MOVED TO THE RIGHT LANE. I HEARD A HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING METAL NOISE. THEN I SMELLED BURNING RUBBER. I WAS ALERT AND VERY AWARE OF ROAD CONDITIONS AND THE TRAFFIC (TWO LANES WERE MERGING FROM THE RIGHT FROM I-275 SO I WAS IN THE CENTER OF FIVE LANES) AND I AM CERTAIN THERE WERE NO OBJECTS IN THE ROAD. THE CONCRETE WAS CLEAR AND SMOOTH. I HEARD A LOUD BANG UNDER THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE TRUCK AND IT TOOK OFF TO THE RIGHT. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THE TRUCK WAS NOT RESPONDING TO THE STEERING WHEEL. I PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, MADE MY BODY RIGID AND PULLED UP ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR MAXIMUM DOWN FORCE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL, I TRAVELED ACROSS BOTH LANES ON MY RIGHT (THE MERGING LANES FROM I-275) AND CAME TO A STOP WITH THE LEFT REAR WHEEL ON THE CONCRETE APRON AND ALL OTHER WHEELS IN THE ROCKY SOIL THAT WAS THE SIDE OF A DITCH WITH A MOUNTAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE TIE ROD END HAD SNAPPED. ONE THEORY IS THAT THE TIE ROD END WAS OVER-HARDENED AND BECAME BRITTLE, POSSIBLY CRACKED, THEN THE NEW U-JOINTS CHANGED THE STRESSES ON IT AND IT SNAPPED.

ON SAT MAY 30TH AT APPROX 11:00 AM PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, I WAS TRAVELING ON THE I 280 SOUTH FREEWAY WITH MY DAUGHTER TO A SOCCER TOURNAMENT IN MY 2005 F250 4X4 SUPER DUTY TRUCK. WE WERE IN CRUISE CONTROL GOING APPROX 55 MPH. WE DROVE OVER WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A LARGE EXPANSION JOINT ON THE FREEWAY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE TRAVELED OVER JOINT, THE VEHICLE START TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND VIBRATE. AFTER A TENSE MOMENT OF COMPLETE TERROR AS THE VEHICLE BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL AND CONTINUED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY WE CAME TO A UNSAFE STOP ON THE FREEWAY. AFTER THE COMPLETE STOP, I IMMEDIATELY HAD TO SPEED UP AGAIN TO PREVENT BEING REAR ENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY. THE REST OF THE TRIP WAS SPENT WHITE KNUCKLED TRAVELING WELL BELOW FREEWAY SPEEDS FOR FEAR OF ANOTHER EPISODE OF SHAKING . EVERY BUMP IN THE ROAD WAS A SCARY REMINDER OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN. MY DAUGHTER IS SCARED TO TRAVEL IN THE TRUCK AND MY WIFE HAS DEMANDED THAT THE PROBLEM BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY,OR \"SELL THE '!@#$% TRUCK\" . THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. FORD MOTOR COMPANY SENT A NOTICE INFORMING ME OF THE PROBLEM. THEY INDICATED IT COULD BE PREVENTED WITH PROPER TIRE PRESSURE. MY TIRES WERE WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF PRESSURE SUGGESTED. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I CHECKED THEM IMMEDIATELY WHEN I ARRIVED HOME. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND PRESENTS A MAJOR RISK TO THE DRIVER OF THESE VEHICLES AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING DRIVERS. I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF MY TRUCK AND HAD FLASHES OF MY DAUGHTER AND I NEVER MAKING IT HOME. THERE WAS A PARENT TRAVELING BEHIND US IN A TRUCK. THEY WITNESSED THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND SAID \"I THOUGHT YOUR AXLE WAS GOING TO COME UNDONE AND YOU WERE GOING TO CRASH\" .THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I WILL BE TAKING MY DAUGHTERS AND MY EXPERIENCE TO AS MANY FORUMS AS POSSIBLE UNTIL THERE IS A FULL RECALL ON THESE TRUCKS.
