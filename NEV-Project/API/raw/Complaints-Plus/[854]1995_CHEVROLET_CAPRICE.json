I REPLIED TO THEM TO CORRECT THE NAME ERROR AND PROVIDE THEM WITH FURTHER INFO AND I RECEIVED TWO REPLIES FROM TWO DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN 3 HOURS OF EACH OTHER.  THE FIRST ONE, A MS. NEJDI, WHO SAID TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ORIGINAL REPRESENTATIVE (A MS. WEIR, WHOM HAD DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, OTHER THAN MIX ME UP WITH A MR. FENNIMORE).  THE SECOND RESPONSE CAME FROM THE ORIGINAL REPRESENTATIVE (MS. WEIR, ADDRESSING ME AS MR. FENNIMORE, AGAIN).  SHE SAID IN THIS EMAIL THE CASE HAD BEEN CLOSED DUE TO MY LACK OF RESPONSE.  IN FACT, I HAD RESPONDED AND EVEN ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT HER ERROR OF THE NAME AND SAID CORRECTION WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY MS. NEJDI, AS PREVOUSLY STATED HEREIN.  THE DISTURBING PART ABOUT THIS IS GM'S FAILURE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE.  A STEERING WHEEL SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE AT A ROUTINE STOP REGARDLESS OF THE AGE OR MILEAGE OF THE CAR WITHOUT BEING INVOLVED IN A CRASH.  GM IS ACTING TOTALLY INCOMPETENT IN HANDLING THE COMPLAINT AS WELL AS IRRESPONSIBLE BY IGNORING A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.

THERE WAS NO POTHOLE OR OTHER ROUGH PLACE IN THE ROADWAY AND THE AUTOMOBILE HAD NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF ACCIDENT.  MY CONCERN FOR ENTERING THIS REPORT IS THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS TYPE OF FAILURE BEFORE THOUGH THE MECHANIC SAYS IT OCCASIONALLY OCCURS.  IN MY MIND THIS PRESENTS A VERY REAL SAFETY HAZARD.  HAD THIS AUTOMBILE BEEN TRAVELING AT 60MPH ON AND OPEN ROAD AND THIS HAD OCCURED THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN SUDDENLY FLIPPING AND ROLLING OF THE CAR WITH THE VERY REAL PROBABILITY OF LOSS OF LIFE.",
