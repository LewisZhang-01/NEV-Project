WATER CAN ENTER THE CONNECTOR THROUGH BODY LEAKS AND MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN VOLTAGE ON APP 1 AND APP 2. ON SOME VEHICLES THIS CAN ALSO CAUSE A MALFUNCTION IN THE BPP/BRAKE SWITCH STATUS CIRCUIT.

THE CAR POSSIBLY HYDROPLANED IN THE RAIN BUT THEN SHE LOST ALL STEERING, BRAKES AND POWER AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. AS A RESULT THE CAR LEFT THE ROADWAY AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FRONT END IMPACT WHEN THE FRONT OF THE CAR HIT A DRAINAGE DITCH.  THE VEHICLE WENT INTO A UNCONTROLLED SPIN AND CAME TO REST BACK IN THE #2 LANE OF N/B HY 99. THE ENGINE WAS NOT RUNNING WHEN THE CAR STOPPED. MY WIFE DID HAVE SEVERAL KEYS ON HER KEY RING. WE BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE HAD THE FLAWED KEY FOB NOT SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH FRONT END IMPACT THAT THE AIRBAGS WOULD HAVE DEPLOYED IF THE CAR WERE RUNNING WHEN THE COLLISION OCCURRED. THE CAR WAS A TOTAL LOSS. I EXPLAINED THE KEY FOB ISSUE TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE CHP OFFICER WHO TOOK THE ORIGINAL REPORT. NEITHER RESEARCHED THIS AND THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THIS FLAW COULD HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN THIS COLLISION. MY WIFE'S INJURIES WERE MINOR. WE ARE AT A LOSS AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PROCEED. MOST ATTORNEYS WILL NOT TAKE THIS CASE BECAUSE THE INJURIES WERE MINOR. I TRUELY BELIEVE THIS CRASH WAS CAUSED BY THE FAULTY KEY FOB AND I DO NOT THINK THE INSURANCE OR THE CHP SHOULD HOLD MY WIFE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. I WILL ATTACH PHOTOS OF OUR CAR SHOWING THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED BUT DIDN'T. I CAN GET COPIES OF THE POLICE REPORT AND THE LETTERS I SENT TO MY INSURANCE AND THE CHP.

OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS WITH STALLING AND REDUCED POWER (ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS REQUIRING THE ADDITIONAL POWER), AS WELL AS ENGINE \"ROUGHNESS\" CERTAINLY CAUSE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR ME.  IN ADDITION, THE PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER SAFETY BAG SEAT PAD SENSOR HAS BEEN ONGOING AND IS ALSO NOT RECALLED, ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM KEEPS PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF IN THE PRESENCE OF A PASSENGER DUE TO A SHORT IN THE PAD, ALSO WELL-DOCUMENTED AND CLEARLY A SAFETY HAZARD. THE INTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEM IS SIMPLY A NUISANCE AND NOT A SAFETY CONCERN AT THIS TIME. THE COST OF REPAIRS IS STAGGERING, AND I'VE NEVER SEEN AN INSTANCE WHERE A TIMING CHAIN NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DURING THE EXPECTED OPERATING PERIOD OF A VEHICLE WITH NORMAL USE. CLEARLY IT IS A DESIGN FLAW WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, AS IT HAS BEEN WITH OTHER VEHICLES UTILIZING THIS ENGINE. THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHICH GO UNREPORTED AND SIMPLY GET REPAIRED AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE IS ALSO QUITE SIGNIFICANT, ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM STARTED INTERMITTENTLY IN LATE 2016 AND HAS BECOME A CONTINUAL PROBLEM AS OF THIS WRITING. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ALWAYS ON AT THIS POINT, WITH THE P008 CODE.",

IT APPEARS THAT IF OTHERS ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE THEN A RECALL SHOULD BE BROADCAST OUT AND BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY? I'M A DIE HARD BOW TIE GUY AND ALL I'VE EVER OWNED WAS A GM CARS AND TRUCKS. I CURRENTLY HAVE MY 2010 CAMARO A 2003 CHEVY TRUCK WITH ONLY 121000 MILES AND A 1971 CHEVY TRUCK THAT IM RESTORING. IS THERE ANYWAY THAT YALL COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE EVERYONE IS STARTING TO HAVE WITH THESE? I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT ENTERPRISE CHEVROLET HAD A CAMARO IN THIS WEEK WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AS WELL AS A FEW OTHERS I'VE TALKED TO.  *TR",

WHILE OUT STROLLING, MY HUSBAND STOPS TO CRANK THE CAR SINCE IT HAD BEEN SITTING FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.  HE GOT IN, CRANKED IT.  NO TROUBLE.  A WEEK LATER I WENT TO DRIVE IT TO WORK, USED REMOTE KEY TO UNLOCK DOORS AND NOTICED THE SEATBACK WAS STUCK CLOSE TO THE STEERING WHEEL. I TRIED LATCH ON SEAT'S BACK AND SIDE LEVER, BUT COULDN'T GET THE SEATBACK TO MOVE.  I CALLED TO TELL MY HUSBAND I WAS TAKING OUR OTHER VEHICLE TO WORK AND ASKED IF HE'D RAISED THE SEATBACK THE DAY HE CRANKED THE CAR FOR GOOD MEASURE. HE DIDN'T RECALL DOING SO. LATER THAT EVENING, WE WENT TO LOOK AT THE CAR TOGETHER, USED THE REMOTE TO UNLOCK THE DOORS. HE TRIED MOVING THE SEATBACK AND COULDN'T.  HE NOTICED THE TRUNK WAS POPPED AND ASKED IF I'D POPPED IT.  I DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT MAYBE I HIT THE WRONG BUTTON WHEN UNLOCKING THE DOORS. HE SLAMMED THE TRUNK SHUT. WE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE FORGOT TO LOCK THE CAR AND SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED THROUGH OUR CAR AND JAMMED THE SEAT. A BRIEF ONLINE SEARCH REVEALED OTHER CAMARO OWNERS W/ SAME ISSUE. THE SEATBACK HAD GONE FORWARD ON ITS OWN. I THOUGHT, IF SEATBACKS ARE MOVING FORWARD ON THEIR OWN WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE'S DRIVING. UNSAFE!  I VISITED NHTSA ONLINE AND SAW PICTURES ARE HELPFUL. I WENT HOME TO TAKE A PIC. THIS TIME THE REMOTE DIDN'T UNLOCK THE DOORS, SO I USED THE KEY. AFTER PHOTOS, I NOTICED THAT THE TRUNK WAS POPPED AGAIN.  NO WAY I 'HIT THE WRONG BUTTON,'  THE REMOTE WASN'T WORKING. I CHECKED TRUNK AND NOTED THE INSIDE LIGHTS WEREN'T ON.  THE CAR'S BATTERY HAD DRAINED FROM THE TRUNK BEING OPEN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS. SEATBACK MOVING FORWARD ON ITS OWN AND TRUNK POPPING ON ITS OWN'NOT A COINCIDENCE.

THEY SAID THESE WERE THE SIGNS THAT THE HEATER CORE \"WENT OUT.\" I THEN WENT TO LOOK NEAR MY HEATER CORE, AND SURE ENOUGH, I HAD COOLANT ON MY PASSENGERS FLOOR BOARD AND FOUND DRIPS OF COOLANT BELOW THE HEATER CORE. MANY OF THE CAMARO OWNERS HAVE SHARED THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH HAVING THIS PROBLEM REPAIRED AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FRONT SEATS, WINDSHIELD, AND DASH HAVE TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THE HEATER CORE.

MY CONCERN IS THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS SAME ISSUE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT PAD SENSOR. THE PAD ITSELF COVERS THE ENTIRE SEAT BOTTOM MADE OF THIN PLASTIC WITH SENSORS BETWEEN THE PLASTIC. I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE AIR BAG SYSTEM EVEN AFTER THE PAD IS REPLACED. VEHICLES ARE ENGINEERED TO BE SAFE USING SEAT BELTS AND AIR BAGS TOGETHER BUT THEY MUST FUNCTION TO DO SO. I HOPE GM STEPS UP AND LOOKS INTO THIS SAFETY ISSUE BEFORE THERE IS A FAILURE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO AN INJURY OR DEATH. I WILL HAVE IT REPAIRED BUT MY CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON THE DEPENDABILITY OF THE AIR BAG SYSTEM IN MY CAMARO!   *TR",

IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RECURRING PROBLEM AMONGST CAMAROS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012. I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR MOST CONSUMERS WHEN I SAY THAT WE HOLD GENERAL MOTORS AT A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THIS AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS IN OUR VEHICLES ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE FIRST 65,000 MILES OF IT'S LIFE. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF GENERAL MOTORS REIMBURSED ME THIS $800 SINCE I THIS IS A PROBLEM I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS SOON IN THE VEHICLES LIFETIME.

DOING RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH LS3'S, MOSTLY HAVING TO DO WITH THE THROTTLE BODY ITSELF OR ACCOMPANYING SENSORS. I'M GOING TO CHANGE TO THROTTLE BODY AND GO FROM THERE. MY MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT WHY ISN'T THIS PROBLEM A RECALL WORTHY ISSUE. IT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH 2010 CAMARO'S, AND MANY OTHER GM VEHICLES OF THE SAME YEAR WITH A V8 ENGINE NOT NECESSARILY THE LS3. WHY DOES IT TAKE LOSS OF LIFE FOR GM TO FIX A MAJOR CONSISTENT PROBLEM. I AM REALLY LOSING FAITH IN THIS COMPANY AND IT'S PRODUCTS. OUR 2010 CAMARO SS SHOULD NOT BE THE VEHICLE SITTING IN OUR DRIVEWAY BROKEN DOWN OVER A 2001 CAMARO SS AND A 2002 S10 TRUCK. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE QUALITY OF GM VEHICLES THESE DAYS?

ABOUT A MILE LATER, I GOT OFF MY EXIT AND WAS COMING DOWN TO THE STOP SIGN,WHEN ALL THE INDICATOR LIGHTS CAME ON FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS. THEY WENT OFF AND I MADE A LEFT HAND TURN AND WENT ABOUT A MILE UP THE ROAD. AT THAT POINT, THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF DOING ABOUT 35MPH. THERE WAS HEAVY TRAFFIC, SO I PULLED OVER AND STARTED IT BACK UP. I CALLED THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP, WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM, AND THEY HAD NO OPENINGS FOR A WEEK. SO I TOOK IT LAST WEEK TO GET IT CHECKED AND THEY FOUND NOTHING THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED IT, THEY SAY. I AM VERY UPSET, BUT VERY THANKFUL THAT MY TWO CHILDREN WERE NOT WITH ME WHEN IT HAPPENED.

RESULT:  THE CAR WILL ACTIVATE CRUISE CONTROL AND WILL START TO REDLINE THE ENGINE.  AS A RESULT IF YOU SHIFT IN TO A LOWER GEAR, THE VEHICLE WILL JUMP TO A VERY HIGH SPEED SINCE THE TACHOMETER IS REDLINING, POTENTIALLY DAMAGING THE ENGINE AND MAKING IT HARD TO CONTROL THE CAR.    PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPLICATED ON TWO DIFFERENT MODELS OF THE SAME VEHICLE.    HAVE NOT REPORTED TO GM BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE LOVES TO ARGUE AND DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. *TR",
