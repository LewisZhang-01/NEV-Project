The car was sold to me with rocket panel damaged, the rear brakes- rotors needed replaced and one side brake completely gone..the pins frozen. The cars transmission fluid dark dirty..low on oil..no coolant or wiper fluid at purchase. They brought car to me during covid. The door didn't shut properly I assumed the rubber around door needed replaced and I planned to have it repaired until I seen a bulge under my driver's side door.took it in and was told by 2 certified auto body places the rocker panel was damaged. My Car started to shimmy when stopping and now the prior recall of fuse relay box burning caused my car to be currently sitting. I don't understand how they could sell me a car like this and this is my complaints. I want my repairs done and money reimbursed I've already paid for. The dealership said because I purchased car AS IS. they aren't responsible to fix. I've owned the car a little over 3 months. This seems unfair and I want answers!!!",

WROTE A LETTER TO CEO OF GM IN JAN. 2010.  AT FIRST, THEY SAID IT WAS MY STATURE THAT I COULD NOT SEE NAVIGATION NOR RADIO. (AM 4' 9\") AND THAT IF I WANTED TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $800 FOR A DIFFERENT RADIO. SINCE THEN, I WENT TO THE DEALER AND HAD THE CAR TEST DRIVEN BY THE SERVICE MANAGER. I HAVE A WORK ORDER CONFIRMING THIS.  RESULTS - NOONE CAN SEE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE DRIVE POSITION. CALLED GM - WAS ANGRY AS THEY LIED TO ME. THEY NOW ADMIT THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BUT WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL MORE COMPLAINTS ARE REGISTERED (I FEEL ACCIDENTS TO HAPPEN). THEY ARE KEEPING AN OPEN FILE. THIS IS WRONG. I CANNOT USE THE SYSTEM AS I'LL HAVE AN ACCIDENT. EVEN THE RADIO, I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE STATIONS UNTIL I AM STOPPED BECAUSE I CANNOT TELL WHERE STATIONS ARE. GM ADVERTISES THE WONDERFUL ON STAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT I CAN'T USE IT OR I'LL GET INTO AN ACCIDENT.  HAVE BEEN CONTACTING GM FOR 3 MONTHS AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING. CAN YOU HELP? *TR",
