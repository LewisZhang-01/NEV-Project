The vehicle also states High coolant temperature sometimes when it does this. At one point it would not go over 35 mph. I took it to the jeep dealer to be told start by replacing both batteries for $600 and then we can go from there! She also stated it was probably electrical. I don't have $600 to spare, especially on a vehicle that's a 2020. Took it to Auto Zone they tested both batteries & said they both tested fine. I ended up purchasing a jump box as this happens at least 3 times/week. Well as of today, now that wont even work.",

        "summary": "An issue with my 2020 Jeep Compass has been reoccurring, regardless of the engine temperature whether at operating temperature or cold, the vehicle will flash a message of \"Coolant Temperature too High\", the vehicle will shut itself down and the operator will need to press the brake, press the start/stop button to fully turn the vehicle off, press the brake again and press the start/stop button again to restart the vehicle. After restarting, the vehicle will run normally until the error message flashes again. this issue will occur when pulling out of the drive way after the vehicle has been sitting over night and when it is stopped at a stop light. When driving at highway speeds the vehicle will flash the same \"Coolant Temperature Too High\" message, act as if it wants to shut itself off for a split second, steering and braking is effected when this happens, and after a split second the vehicle returns to normal operation. The vehicle has been into a Jeep dealership multiple times, on one occasion the auxiliary battery was replaced and that seemed to have solved the issue for a few months but the same coolant temperature message and associated issues returned. The vehicle was taken back to the dealership again and no issues were found. After the most recent trip to the dealership the vehicle drove and operated normally for four days until the next day, the same message and issues listed above happened twice in one morning. I have filed a complaint with Fiat Chrysler, the dealerships have no solution to this issue which in my opinion is a safety hazard, due to the fact the vehicle wants to turn off while traveling at highway speeds.",

WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE ISSUE BEFORE SIGNING PAPERS, THE SALESMAN CHECKED WITH SERVICE & WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD TAKEN CARE OF THE ISSUE. THEY DID NOT. I HAD MY OIL CHANGED AT 830 MILES (I DON'T DRIVE A LOT) AND IT WAS 1 QUART LOW. IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR MODEL YEAR 2018 BUT NOT 2020. IT IS THE SAME ENGINE AND SAME ISSUE. IT IS A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION. WHY NOT 2020?",
