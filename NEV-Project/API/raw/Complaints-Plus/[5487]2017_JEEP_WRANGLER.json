Jeep is not properly addressing the issue as there are dozens of reports of multiple failures. There are indications that the failures may be related to MOPAR\u2019s wireless software upgrade program, but no one knows for sure.   As well, Jeep\u2019s near silence on the issue is concerning.  When returned to a dealership the reaction is usually one of surprise and astonishment that the problem has occurred followed by a hefty repair cost if the vehicle is out of warranty.

Then, two days ago my \"Malfunction Warning Light\" (check engine light) came in my dashboard and remained illuminated after an oil change and gas fill. I took my Jeep to the local Crystler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram dealership where they told me the code for the problem was a \"Evap System Small Leak,\" but they could not take my car in for another week to look into the issue further. This concerned me, so I then took my Jeep to a Midas where they ran many tests to find that I had a \"small fracture where the FPS inserts to the tank.\" Midas told me that although it is just the leak detection and purge valve that need a minor repair, this part cannot be purchased separately and I would need to pay to replace the whole gas tank for $2700. The technician told me he had seen this a few times before with Jeep Wranglers around the same year as mine before the 2018 models came out with a new tank, and that I couldn't have done anything to cause it because it is just a substandard part that was put in Jeeps of my model/year.   I was told that if this issue is not corrected soon, it is unsafe to drive. A larger crack could grow and cause fuel to leak, which then becomes a fire safety hazard. The current fuel emissions/vapors escaping are harmful to breathe in, and to the environment. I was told my Jeep wouldn't pass smog inspection in it's current state.   I have found a Crystler recall for faulty 2017 Jeep Wrangler fuel tanks, Recall no. 16V849000 (Crystler Recall no. S90) that applies exactly to my situation. However, although it is the exact problem I am experiencing, the dealership told me there are no open recalls for my specific 2017 Jeep Wrangler.    I now have an open appointment to have the dealership take a closer look, but I don't believe I should need to pay for this large repair since it was a clear recall and common issue with 2017 Jeep Wranglers just like mine.",

Upon inspection by the dealership, it was noted that only one side of the bracket had been welded at the factory. Jeep will not accept fault and since my vehicle exceeds the 36 month warranty they state that I am responsible for all repair costs.  Prior to this issue, I noticed over the previous year a slight shimmy in the front end thinking my tires were out of balance even when I had them rebalanced and had them rotated.  I have been speaking to Jeep who has been unresponsive and evasive. I recently heard about other such incidences online and from JK forum which was recently validated by my insurance company who has rejected my claim for repairs because it is classified as a known fault.",

WE WERE APPROACHING A SMALL CITY WITH STREET LIGHTS WHICH MADE TRAVELING SAFER.  I PULLED OFF AN EXIT TO ASSESS THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE.  BOTH HEADLIGHTS WERE COVERED IN SNOW.  SINCE THE JEEPS LIGHTS ARE RECESSES A BIT, THE SNOW FILLED THE POCKETS COMPLETELY. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME DRIVING (SINCE 1984) THAT I HAD TO CLEAR SNOW FROM THE HEADLIGHTS WHILE DRIVING.  I LIVE IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND SO SNOW IN THE WINTER IS A COMMON EVENT.  WHAT I DEDUCED WAS THAT THE LED LIGHTS WERE NOT GENERATING ANY HEAT.  THIS WAS THE LIKELY REASON FOR THE SNOW BUILD UP.

HOW BAD THIS COULD HAVE TURN OUT TO BE IF CITY WORKERS WHERE NOT NEAR BY WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER?.   JEEP NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.

BOTH TIMES IT HAPPENED I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 6:30AM, BEFORE THE SUN CAME UP.   THE FIRST OCCASION THE TEMP WAS 29, NEXT TIME IT WAS 31.  PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT WORK VERY WELL MAKING IT VERY HARD TO SEE.  I FEEL THIS IS A DANGER TO ME AND THOSE AROUND ME AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED.    I HAVE CONTACTED BOTH A DEALER AND JEEPCARES ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO CORRECT IT.      HIGH QUALITY AFTERMARKET LED HEADLIGHTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH OR WITHOUT AN AUTOMATIC HEATER ELEMENT TO PREVENT THEM FROM ICING OVER.  TRUCKLITE IS ONE BRAND THAT OFFERS THEM.",
