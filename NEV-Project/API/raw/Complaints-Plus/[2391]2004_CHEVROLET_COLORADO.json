I took it to my local mechanic (Bob's Repair of Mayer) and they said it was not safe to drive. It is a complete blindside to me and now I have to find a spare (safe) car to help drive around my newborn and toddler. I am going to attempt to repair the frame as I do not have any other options for vehicles. There were obviously no warnings are notices that about this issue, but it seems to be uncannily common for this generation of Chevrolet vehicles. The truck only has 160,000 miles on it and surface rust on the cab. The vehicle is not drivable and not safe as the frame could give away at any moment.",

THE VEHICLE WAS REACTING AS IF THE WHEELS WERE LOCKING UP, SO IT WAS PREMATURELY ENGAGING THE ANTILOCK. THIS HAPPENED MOSTLY ON DRY PAVEMENT DURING LIGHT BREAKING.

IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER I WROTE AN ANGRY LETTER TO THE DEALERSHIP MANAGEMENT THAT THEY REPLACED A VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR WHICH SOLVED THE PROBLEM. IT WAS AGGRAVATING BECAUSE I HAD TO PAY EXTRA FOR ANTILOCK FEATURES WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE. THE ANTILOCK FEATURE WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE SAFETY, BUT ENDED UP BEING VERY DANGEROUS. IF I WOULD'VE HAD A WRECK BECAUSE OF THE BAD BRAKES, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE LIKELY HELD ME LIABLE, FOR AN EXPENSIVE AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT THEY HAD CREATED. THE GOVERNMENT HAD PRESSURED THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY TO INCLUDE EXPENSIVE ANTILOCK BRAKES THAT WERE COMPLICATED, UNRELIABLE AND DANGEROUS.

IT INVOLVES THE HEATER BLOWER MOTOR RESISTOR ASSEMBLY.  8 YEARS AGO MY DAUGHTER USED PUT HER BACK PACK ON THE PASSENGER FLOOR WHERE IT REPEATEDLY MADE IMPACTED THE CONNECTION TO THE BLOWER MOTOR RELAY ASSEMBLY.  THIS EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE  PIN AND SOCKET ON THE ORANGE WIRE TO SEPARATE TO THE POINT WHERE IT ARCED AND BURNT.  I FOUND AND REPAIRED THE SOCKET WHEN THE HEATER WOULD ONLY WORK ON HIGH.   ON THE 16TH OF DEC 2013, A PASSENGER SIZE 12 SHOES ACCIDENTALLY, AND UNWITTINGLY KICKED THE SAME SPOT AND CAUSED THE SAME FAULT.  I REPAIRED THE SOCKET AGAIN.  MY COMPLAINT  IS THE RESISTOR CONNECTION IS IN A SPOT TO EASILY SERVICE, BUT IT IS IN A VULNERABLE SPOT FOR ACCIDENTAL CONTACT.  I BELIEVE IT NEEDS A ROBUST PROTECTIVE COVER, EITHER METAL OR PLASTIC.  FOR PEOPLE THAT CANNOT REPAIR THEIR OWN VEHICLES, THIS SITUATION COULD COST THEM A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS.  MY OTHER ELECTRICAL FAULT IS THE RIGHT SIDE WINDOW MOTOR.  IT QUIT WORKING COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE IT APART AND CLEAN THE BRUSHES.  IT WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS UNTIL IT STOPPED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.  I REPLACED THE MOTOR BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND BRUSHES TO REPLACE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT THE BRUSHES FAILED BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE BRITTLE FROM SLAMMING THE DOORS TOO HARD BY THE PASSENGERS.  THE DOORS ARE LIGHT AND IT IS COMMON FOR THEM TO SLAMMED.  THE BRUSHES OR THE MOTOR NEED TO BE MORE ROBUST.  *TR",

MY DAUGHTER WAS BEHIND ME IN HER CAR. ABOUT 5 MILES DOWN THE ROAD MY DAUGHTER STARTS FLASHING HER LIGHTS SO I PULLED OVER AND SHE CAME RUNNING UP AND TOLD ME MY VEHICLE WAS ON FIRE , I ORDERED MY GRANDSON AND HIS FRIEND OUT OF THE TRUCK WE LEFT IMMEDIATELY , AND BACKED OFF ABOUT 200 FEET, YOU COULD SEE SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE AND FIRE DRIPPING FROM JUST ABOVE THE TRANSFER CASE BELOW THE FRONT PASSENGERS FLOORBOARD AREA. THE  FIRE SPREAD AND THE VEHICLE BECAME FULLY ENGULFED THE TIRE MELTED THE LEATHER INTERIOR WAS COMPLETELY VAPORIZED NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS A TOTAL LOSS. MY THEORY IS THAT THE SWITCHING MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSFER CASE IS DEFECTIVE IT SHOULD NOT HAVE SWITCHED ON IT'S OWN AT 75MPH. I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IT DID. THAT CAUSED SOME KIND OF DAMAGE INTERNALLY IN THE TRANSFER CASE. WHEN I DROVE THE VEHICLE IT HEATED UP UNTIL IT WAS RED HOT AND CAUGHT THE FUEL FILTER ON FIRE WHICH EVENTUALLY RUPTURED SPREAD THE FIRE AND DESTROYED THE VEHICLE.  *TR",

IT IS RIDICULOUS TO THINK THAT THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS SWITCH, HAS BEEN RECALLED, HAS BEEN FIXED, STILL NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY, AND GM WILL NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHEN IT CONTINUES TO FAIL.  IF IT IS SUCH A PROBLEM THAT GM WILL DO A RECALL FOR THE PART, WHY IS IT NOT A BIG ENOUGH PROBLEM TO FIX CORRECTLY OR ANOTHER TIME WITH THE FAULTY PART FAILS AGAIN?
