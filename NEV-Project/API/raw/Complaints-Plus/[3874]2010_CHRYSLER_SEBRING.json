THE CAR HAD/HAS POPPING CREAKING NOISES THAT CAME FROM THE FRONT END.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT CHRYSLER HAS RECALLS ON 2010 SEBRINGS REGARDING THE POWER STEERING (NHTSA CAMPAIGN # 10VA75000). I TOOK IN  TO BE CHECKED.  THE NAPLES DODGE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT MY CAR MODEL WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE RECALL.  NAPLES DODGE DID FIND A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING AND REPLACED THE STEERING GEAR, RACK AND PINION AND ADJUSTED THE TOE AND ALIGNMENT.  THE USED CAR WARRANTY PAID FOR IT EXCEPT FOR MY $50 DEDUCTIBLE.  SINCE THIS REPAIR THE AIRBAG LIGHT REMAINS ON.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER SERVICEMAN THAT THE LIGHT WOULD GO OFF AFTER A WHILE.  IT HAS NEVER GONE OFF.  I HAD IT CHECKED TWICE AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN TWO OPINIONS ON THE AIR BAG LIGHT. 1.  IT'S OK IGNORE IT  2.  I HAVE NO AIRBAG PROTECTION. I TRUST #2 MECHANIC AND FEEL UNSAFE IN THIS CAR, UNLIKE ANY OF THE CARS I'VE HAD IN THE PAST 45 YEARS.   TO THIS DAY  THE STEERING FEELS FUNNY, MAKES LITTLE POPPING NOISES, AND THE LIGHT IS STILL ON AND CHRYSLER HAS A NEW RECALL FOR AIRBAGS (NHTSA 14V35400).  LETS SEE IF THE DODGE/CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP TAKES ANY RESPONSIBILITY?   I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS EXPENSIVE REPAIRS WITH THIS 2010 SEBRING. I USED TO OWN A 2005 SEBRING AND I HAD FEW PROBLEMS AND LOVED THE CAR.  SINCE FIAT TOOK OVER CHRYSLER THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS, ACCORDING TO MECHANICS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  I BELIEVE THE CAR HAS BEEN ENGINEERED TO FAIL.  I HAVE ABOUT $4,000 IN REPAIRS TO PROVE IT.  I WILL NEVER BUY A CHRYSLER AGAIN.  *TR",
