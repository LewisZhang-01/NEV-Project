This has started to happen after hot weather had started few months back. I have tried to reproduce this issue several times, but it happens randomly and Not all the time. I don't drive the car much. But this is definitely a serious issue, I checked the BMW community and a lot of people are facing this issue. Not Sure how many have filed a complaint here. But this definitely should be addressed by BMW as this is not just one person facing this issue, there are hundreds and thousands of them. Level of severity is high, as someone who might have not faced this issue yet might suddenly face it on the highway could result in an extremely fatal accident. Havent reported to BMW yet, But found this issue is being faced by alot of people I thought to file my complaint here. I will soon get it repaired or replaced. There were no Warning lamps or messages prior to this. It started happening in September 2021.",
