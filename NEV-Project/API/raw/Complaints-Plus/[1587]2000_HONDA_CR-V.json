TO THE POINT, THE DOORS DO NOT OPEN, FAIL TO LATCH \u0013 OR BOTH. IN FEBRUARY, I COULD NOT GET THE HATCH DOOR TO OPEN. I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL DEALER (SUNNYSIDE HONDA) AND THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM AND CHARGED ME $125. I WAS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT DOOR (IT WOULD NOT OPEN) AND THE DEALER ORDERED PARTS WHICH WERE INSTALLED A FEW WEEKS LATER. THE CHARGE WAS $390.90.     NOW THE DRIVER-SIDE FRONT DOOR IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE LATCH. I CAN\u0019T GET THE CAR TO LOCK AND OPENING IT IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC UNLESS I PULL VERY HARD ON THE HANDLE.     THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF ROUTINE MAINTENANCE FOR THIS VEHICLE. THERE IS SOMETHING DEFECTIVE IN THE DOOR LATCHES AND LOCKING SYSTEMS OF THIS CRV. HOW MUCH MORE MUST I PAY TO SIMPLY OPEN AND SHUT THE DOORS ON MY CAR? I HAVE ALREADY HAD TO PAY $515.90 FOR THE REPAIR OF 2 DOOR HANDLES/LATCHES/LOCKS. I CAN SEE ANOTHER REPAIR BILL IN MY FUTURE AS THE FRONT DRIVER\u0019S DOOR IS ALMOST INOPERABLE. THIS PRESENTS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM IN THAT GETTING OUT OF THE CAR DURING AN EMERGENCY IS VERY DIFFICULT.    IS THERE SOME RECALL THAT I MISSED THAT ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM? I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE THAT IT IS UNREASONABLE TO HAVE 3 DOORS ON THE SAME 2000 CAR WITH THE SAME MECHANICAL PROBLEM. I REQUEST THAT YOU REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COSTS SO FAR AND ARRANGE TO HAVE THE FRONT DRIVERS-SIDE DOOR REPAIRED.    ALL I WANT TO DO IS GET IN/OUT OF THE VEHICLE. CAN YOU HELP?

INITIALLY, PROBLEM OCCURRED AT RANDOM, ONCE OR TWICE PER MONTH. REGULAR SERVICE CHECKS REVEALED NO PROBLEM. THE CAR RUNS WITHOUT PROBLEMS ALL DAY ONCE THE INITIAL STALLING OF THE ENGINE HAS OCCURRED. CONSUMER INFORMATION HAS FOUND THIS TO BE AN IGNITION SWITCH PROBLEM, BUT HONDA-AUTHORIZED SERVICE DEALER REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY RECALL OR PROBLEM ON THIS MODEL ON 1/17/2004. INSTEAD, HONDA CLAIMS THAT A SCHEDULED \"VALVE ADJUSTMENT\" WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM. ENGINE STALLING AND INTERRUPTION OF POWER STEERING IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM WHILE DRIVING, AND THE OCCURRENCE IS NOT PREDICTABLE - HOW CAN I BE SATISFIED WITH A \"VALVE ADJUSTMENT\" AND TAKE THE CAR BACK ON THE ROAD?  2) ADVANCED TIRE WEAR.  THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 33,000 AND I HAD TO REPLACE TIRES.  FIRESTONE / BRIDGESTONE DEALER MENTIONED THAT THE WEAR IS PREMATURE AND SOLD ME A NEW SET OF TIRES FOR A FAIR PRICE.    HONDA AUTHORIZED DEALER MENTIONED THAT IT IS DRIVER/OWNER RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN VEHICLE TIRE PRESSURE AND ROTATE TIRES ACCORDING TO SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.  I HAVE ROTATED AND KEEP CORRECT PRESSURE IN TIRES AT ALL TIMES.  3) WHILE MAKING A SHARP TURN (MORE NOTICEABLE WHILE MAKING A U-TURN) PRIMARILY FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE, A LOUD HOWLING NOISE CAN BE HEARD.  THE SAME FIRESTONE / BRIDGESTONE DEALER NOTICED THE SAME SOUNDS AND REFERRED ME TO THE HONDA DEALER.  HONDA AUTHORIZED DEALER MENTIONED THAT A LUBE SERVICE IS NECESSARY TO TAKE THAT HOWLING NOISE AWAY FROM MY VEHICLE.  FIRESTONE / BRIDGESTONE BELIEVE MORE THAN A LUBE JOB IS NEEDED.  4) REAR GLASS TRUNK LID LEAKS DURING CAR WASHES AND STRONG WINDY RAIN. *JB",
