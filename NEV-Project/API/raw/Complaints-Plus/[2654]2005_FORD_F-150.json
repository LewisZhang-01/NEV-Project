U-haul is aware of the issue and doesn't allow certain Ford vehicles to tow their trailers due to this issue.

The rest of my truck looks excellent but the frame is so bad its most likely not repairable. I am not the only one with this major safety issue. Its only a 16 year old truck. Thankfully I have not towed or put a large load in the bed or else it could split in half. I wash my car seasonally and pressure wash off rust every spring. Yet the frame has rotted so badly they could not put it on a lift to do the alignment. I love this truck and I'm a big fan of the f150 line as a whole. Ford should take responsibility as Toyota has and fix their customers frames from this generation. I love ford but its always interesting walking through a parking lot and seeing every 04-08 f150 with major frame rot. Without fail every single one has that issue. Seems to me like they didn't properly galvanize and protect the steel. I am now needing to do a bed off frame restoration since no shop will take it on. This truck that should be going for $5k with this insane used car market. (August 3rd 2020) yet it is max $200 in scrap. Bad / cheap engineering should not be the owners responsibility. Yet that is what it has come to. It was most likely an honest unforseen mistake on their part. Overengineering the rigidity but ignoring the long term effects. Short term strength for log term pain as is commonly said with these trucks. I'm sure in a few years time these will just start breaking in half over bumps on the freeway. I beg and encourage ford to fix this before people die. I doubt ford wants another pr fiasco like the pinto. Hopefully they will do a cost analysis and realize that a recall is a much better option. Seem like 250-500k a pop for settlements for the most popular truck of all time is much much more than 5k per affected vehicle. Not including the long term dip in sales. So unless they want the other brands to win the truck war they gotta fix it.  Tldr: a recall is cheaper than death.",

AT THIS TIME I NOTICED SMOKE STARTING TO COME INSIDE CAB FROM UNDER DASH AND THRU THE VENTS. I JUMPED OUT AND OPENED THE HOOD. A 1 FOOT SECTION OF A WIRING HARNES MOUNTED TO THE FIREWALL HAD CAUGHT FIRE. I MADE ATTEMPTS TO PUT OUT THE FIRE BUT WITHIN A FEW SECONDS THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS ENGULFED. IN 2 TO 3 MINUTES THE ENTIRE INSIDE OF THE CAB WAS ALSO COMPLETELY ON FIRE. MY WIFE WHO WAS WATCHING ME IMMEDIATLY CALLED 911 TO GET THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. AFTER 3 MINUTES THE TRUCK WAS ALREADY A TOTAL LOSE. DUE TO THE TRUCK BEING ONLY 60' FROM MY HOUSE AND BURNING SO HOT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MY HOUSE CATCHING FIRE.  TWO GENTLEMAN FROM THE RESCUE SQUAD ARRIVED BUT IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ANYTHING TO BE DONE. I WAS ABLE TO GET A BACKHOE AND PUT THE FIRE OUT WITH SNOW.    UNFORTUNATELY I HAD LIABILITY INSURANCE ONLY WHICH MEANT A TOTAL LOSE. I NEVER DREAMED THAT THE TRUCK WOULD BURN UP SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY!!!! I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RECALLS FOR F150 DUE TO FIRE HAZARDS WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL FOR OTHER YEAR MODEL CLOSE TO 2005. A VEHICLE CATCHING FIRE WHILE ITS SITTING IN A DRIVEWAY RUNNING IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE TRUCK WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND HAD NO AFTER MARKET PARTS OR WORK PERFORMED.

THE TRUCK LOST ALL POWER, NO STEERING, AND IT STALL ON THE HIGHWAY GOING ABOUT 65 MPH.  LUCKILY, SHE SAID THERE WERE VEHICLES BEHIND HER AND SHE PULLED IT OVER WITH NO STEERING AND THE ENGINE DEAD. MY WIFE THEN SAT ON THE HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE, WHICH STARTED AND THERE WERE NO \"ENGINE FAILSAFE MODE\" ON DISPLAY ANYMORE.

HOWEVER THIS WAS A PANICKY SITUATION IN THE LAST SECOND BEFORE CRASHING THE TRUCK I APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKES.

I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT FORD WOULD INSTALL OR DESIGN THE HOLDING BRACKETS THAT COULD POSSIBLY MOVE CLOSE TO THE TIRE RIM FOR THE BRAKE HOSES THAT CLOSE TO THE TIRE RIM.   ALSO I STOP OVER TO A FORD DEALER IN READING PA WHY THEY WOULD NOT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WHEN I HAVE THE TRUCK INSPECTED IN OCTOBER OF 2013. THE SUPERVISOR AT THE DESK HAVE NO ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. THEN I CHECK SIMILAR TRUCKS THE YEAR WAS 2008 AND THE BRAKE LINE WAS LESS THAN .250\" FROM THE TIRE RIM. WHEN I CHECKED THE 2014  E150 IT LOOKS THAT THE  BRAKE LINES LOCATION WERE REDESIGN. SO OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY NEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER I WAS NEVER NOTIFY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, THE BRACKET THAT HOLD THE BRAKE LINES WERE NEVER ADJUSTED AWAY FROM BEING THAT CLOSE TO A TIRE RIM AT THE INSPECTION.

THE FIRST TIME WAS BEFORE IT WAS OUT OF IT 36,000 MILE FACTORY WARRANTY, THE SECOND TIME WAS BEFORE IT WAS OUT OF THE 100,000 EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I PURCHASED SO LUCKILY THOSE TWO TIMES DID NOT COST ME ANYTHING BUT NOW IT NEEDS IT AGAIN AND THE MECHANIC TELL ME IT COULD COST $5000 SO WITH THE MOTOR ISSUE AND THE REAREND ISSUE I COULD POSSIBLY SPEND $14,000 IN REPAIRS WHICH AGAIN IS CRAZY WHEN YOU SPENT CLOSE TO $50,000.00 ON THE VEHICLE TO BEGIN WITH.  *TR",

THE FIRST SPARK PLUG POPPED OUT IN AUGUST 2011 AND NOW IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER 2013. I HAVE HEARD THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THIS IS HAPPENED TO. THIS SEEMS TO BE A RECURRING PROBLEM IN NOT ONLY THE 4.6 LITER V-8 BUT THE 5.4 LITER V-8 AND THE 6.8 LITER V-10.  WITH THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHY HASN'T FORD DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. FORDPROBLEMS.COM SUGGESTS THAT FORD INSISTS THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO IMPROPER TORQUING OF NEW PLUGS OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS. HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE ORIGINAL FACTORY SPARK PLUGS EJECT FROM THE ENGINE, WHICH INDICATES THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THE ENGINE & CYLINDER HEAD DESIGN. THE REPAIR IS RELATIVELY EASY - DO NOT BE FOOLED BY A DEALER OFFERING TO REPAIR THE ISSUE FOR $700 OR MORE. AN INEXPENSIVE HELICOIL KIT WILL DO THE TRICK. ALSO, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND SIMPLY RE-TAPPING THE SPARK PLUG THREADS BECAUSE THE THREADS ARE PROBABLY TOO DAMAGED ALREADY & THE SPARK PLUG MAY JUST BLOW OUT AGAIN CAUSING MORE DAMAGE. SPARK PLUG EJECTION IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE FUEL VAPOR STARTS COMING OUT THE SPARK PLUG HOLE, WHICH IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THE FUEL VAPOR CAN BE IGNITED BY THE LOOSE SPARK PLUG AND IN FACT THERE HAVE BEEN A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES REPORTED OF ENGINE FIRES DUE TO SPARK PLUG EJECTION/BLOWOUT.

BY THE WAY, I AM A MOTHER OF 3, DAUGHTER OF 2, SISTER TO 1 AND THE GIRLFRIEND OF A MEAN BIKER, SHOULD I PARISH MY CHILDREN WOULD BE ORPHANS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY, SHOULD ANY OF MY CHILDREN BE SO MUCH AS HARMED DUE TO THIS WELL DEPICTED ISSUE, FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS GOING TO WISH MY CHILDREN WERE ORPHANED!  [XXX]  P.S. I ALSO COME FROM A FAMILY OF FORD ENTHUSIASTS, THUS I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN YOUR LOYALTY AND THEREFORE WILL ALLOW YOU A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF TIME TO INCLUDE MY 2005 FORD F-150 IN YOUR RECALL (AND NOTIFY ME OF IT), BEFORE I FORWARD THIS CORRESPONDENCE TO THE NHTSA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INSTRUCTS ME TO.  *TR",

THE FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY FRONT IMPACT SENSOR, WHICH SHORTED OUT.  THE SHORTED SENSOR, IN TURN, SHORTED OUT THE ENTIRE RESTRAINT SYSTEM MODULE (THE \"BRAIN BOX\" ).  AFTER INVESTIGATING ON THE INTERNET, I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  IT SEEMS THAT THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT IMPACT SENSOR, PLACED ON THE HOOD LATCH SUPPORT, MAKES THE SENSOR SUSCEPTIBLE TO WATER INFILTRATION.  CORROSION THEN CAUSES THE SENSOR TO FAIL.  FURTHERMORE, WITH THE FREEZE-THAW CYCLE IN MICHIGAN, WATER THAT IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE SENSOR CAN EVENTUALLY CRACK THE HOUSING, ALLOWING EVEN MORE MOISTURE TO GET INSIDE.  THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE RESTRAINT SYSTEM MODULE WAS DESTROYED BY THE SHORT IN ONE IMPACT SENSOR IS QUITE DISCONCERTING.  THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ENGINEERED TO PREVENT SUCH CATASTROPHIC ELECTRICAL DAMAGE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE SENSOR DESIGN AND PLACEMENT WAS POORLY ENGINEERED FOR VEHICLES IN THE NORTHERN CLIMATE WHERE THE FREEZE-THAW CYCLE AND ROAD SALT ARE PRESENT.  *TR",

THERE WAS PROBABLY 3/4 PADS LEFT AND PARKING BRAKE WAS GOOD. THE ONLY THING WAS A LOT OF BRAKE DUST, SO WE CLEANED EVERYTHING WITH BRAKE CLEANER AND PUT EVERYTHING BACK TOGETHER.

THE REAR RIGHT FAILURE OCCURRED LAST FALL (AUGUST 2009) WHILE GOING THROUGH A CAR WASH WITH MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE.  WITHOUT ANY WARNING, MY DAUGHTER STARTED SCREAMING AS HER WINDOW FELL INSIDE THE DOOR.  THANKFULLY, THERE WERE NO INJURIES, BUT I DID HAVE WET CHILDREN AND WET INTERIOR.  OF COURSE, THE CARWASH DENIED ANY WRONGDOING AND SUGGESTED I CONTACT FORD.  IN DOING SO, FORD STATED THAT NHTSA DID NOT ISSUE A RECALL, SO THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO FIX/REPAIR AT THEIR OWN COST.  NOT HAVING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE, I TORE THE DOOR PANEL OPEN, SLID THE WINDOW BACK UP IN THE TRACK, AND WEDGED A PIECE OF PVC PIPE TO KEEP THE GLASS IN PLACE.  NOT A GREAT SOLUTION...BUT MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT FORD OFFERED TO DO.    THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT OCCURRED SATURDAY, JULY 11, 2010, MID-AFTERNOON.  MY FAMILY AND I WERE TRAVELING TO A COMMUNITY FUNCTION.  WHILE DRIVING, I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A SHOTGUN GO OFF NEXT TO MY EAR.  OUR INITIAL THOUGHT WAS WE HIT SOMETHING ON THE ROAD OR AN ANIMAL RAN INTO US.  I STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK, BUT DID NOT SEE ANY DAMAGE.  AT THAT POINT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.  WE CONTINUED ON TO OUR FUNCTION WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ISSUES.  WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK AT THE VEHICLE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, I STARTED TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOWS WHILE THE A/C COILED OFF AND THUD...THE FRONT DRIVER WINDOW FELL DOWN.  I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.  TORE INTO THE DOOR WHEN WE GOT HOME AND FOUND THAT THE WINDOW REGULATOR PULLEY FAILED IN THIS WINDOW ALSO.  SO, I PUSHED THE GLASS BACK UP AND WEDGED ANOTHER PIECE OF PVC PIPE.  ASIDE FROM THE RINGING IN MY EAR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON FROM THE \"GUNSHOT\", THERE WERE NO INJURIES.    FROM MY RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT FORD REFUSES TO ADDRESS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP AND RESEARCH IN THIS MATTER. *TR",

THREE YEARS AGO, WHEN THE FIRST REGULATOR FAILED, I HAD MY VEHICLE PARKED (LUCKILY AT HOME) AND I NOTICED THAT THE WINDOW WAS IN THE DOWN POSITION.  I RECALLED ROLLING THE WINDOW UP WHEN I PARKED MY VEHICLE, SO I GOT IN IT TO PUT THE WINDOW IN THE UP POSITION.  AFTER TURNING THE IGNITION ON AND PRESSING THE UP BUTTON, NOTHING HAPPENED.  THIS TIME IT WAS THE DRIVERS WINDOW.

I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE REMAINING 2 WINDOWS WILL FAIL OVER TIME.  ON BOTH OCCASIONS, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT WINDOW REGULATOR INSTALLED.

I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TRUCK UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND MY TRUCK CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 67,000 MILES ON IT.  HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY THREE (3) WEEKS AGO I NOTICED MY TRUCK \"SPUTTERING\" AND \"MISSING\" AND HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY STARTING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP (KAMAAINA MOTOR'S) THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM.  THE MECHANICS ARE NOW TELLING ME THAT THE SPARK PLUGS BROKE OFF AND FELL INTO THE ENGINE \"HEAD\".   THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE PIECES OF THE SPARK PLUGS (TWO AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY REPORTING) BUT THEY FEEL THAT THE IMPACT OF THE SPARK PLUGS FALLING INTO THE HEAD MAY HAVE NOW CAUSED MY MOTOR TO FREEZE UP.  AT THIS POINT THEY ARE RECOMMENDING COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT FOR MY TRUCK WHICH WILL COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.  I AM DEVASTATED.  THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND I STILL OWE MONEY TO THE BANK TO PAY IT OFF.  I DON'T HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE MOTOR AND I KNOW CAN'T JUST GET ANOTHER LOAN FOR ANOTHER CAR.  I HAVE BEEN READING ONLINE ABOUT THIS REPEATED FAILURE ON FORD'S FAULT OF DEFECTIVE SPARK PLUGS AND THAT THIS IS COMMON AND OF NO FAULT OF THE OWNERS OF THE VEHICLES.  AT THIS POINT MY TRUCK IS STILL SITTING AT THE MECHANICS AND IS NOT MOVING AND I AM WITHOUT A CAR.  IS THERE NOT ANYTHING THAT THE FORD COMPANY CAN DO TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTIONS??  I DEVASTATED BY THIS AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM GOING TO DO TO GET BACK INTO A RUNNING VEHICLE SO I CAN GET TO WORK AND TAKE MY KIDS TO AND FROM SCHOOL.  PLEASE HELP????? *TR",

THE NOISE WAS COMING FORM THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR WAS SHAKING AS IF MISS FIRING OR RUNNING IRATICLY.  I HAD NO ENGINE WARNING LIGHT OR ANY OTHER NOTIFICATIONS ON THE DASH PRIOR.  I WENT DIRECTLY TO MY MECHANIC.  WHEN MY MECHANIC CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY WHAT WAS GOING ON.  HE HAS REPAIRED THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE.  HE SAID THAT I HAD BLOWNOUT A LEAST ONE SPARK PLUG.  THIS IS A KNOWN FLAW WITH THE TRITON V8 MOTORS OR RATHER THE SPARK PLUG DESIGN THAT WAS PUT IN THE ENGINE FROM THE FACTORY.  THE SPARK PLUG IS A THREE PIECE DESIGN THE IS CRIMPED TOGETHER AND ULTIMATELY CRACKS AND SEPARATES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME LEADING TO LITERALLY BLOWING UP.  IN SOME CASES THE THREADS IN THE MOTOR WHERE THE SPARK PLUG SCREWS IN CAN BE TORN OUT.  THIS REQUIRES RE-TAPPING NEW THREADS OR A HELIOCOIL PACK.  THIS ISSUE WAS NOT POINTED OUT TO ME BY FORD PRIOR SO I COULD PREVENT POSSIBLE DAMAGE AND VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR COSTS AS I KNOW THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THAT IS VERY WRONG.  THE MANUAL PROVIDED BY FORD WITH THE TRUCK SAYS THE SPARK PLUGS DON'T NEED TO BE CHANGED UNTIL 100K.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION ONLINE I FOUND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM PRIOR TO 100K.  I WILL BE SENDING THE BILL TO REPAIR MY TRUCK TO FORD THROUGH MY ATTORNEY AS THIS IS NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR AND A FAULTY DESIGN FLAW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED.  FORD IS SENDING OWNERS OF THIS MOTOR DOWN A PATH OF GUARANTEED FINANCIAL AND POTENTIAL PHYSICAL HARM.  FORD NEEDS TO STAND UP AND OWN THIS MISTAKE. *TR",

TRUCK WAS MOVING AT 25-30 MPH. ADDITIONAL PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE PEDAL CAUSED NO ACCELERATION.  LIGHT TRAFFIC ALLOWED ME TO COAST TO SHOULDER WHERE I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE TRUCK IN PARK.  TRUCK FAULTED INTO 'LIMP MODE' THAT LIMITS THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL OPERATION (PER MANUAL), THIS WAS INDICATED BY THE 'WRENCH' LIGHT ON THE DASH, NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED.  TURNED THE IGNITION OFF, WAITED A ~15 SECONDS AND RESTARTED.  UPON RESTART 'WRENCH' LIGHT CLEARED AND ACCELERATOR FUNCTIONED AS PRIOR, AGAIN NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED.  INCIDENT 2) 02/12/10 - WHILE DRIVING ON A FEDERAL HIGHWAY AT 55 MPH IN RIGHT LANE THE SAME SEQUENCE AS INCIDENT ONE ABOVE OCCURRED ? THE TRUCK ACCELERATOR PEDAL BECAME INACTIVE. BEING IN THE RIGHT-MOST LANE I WAS ABLE TO COAST ON TO THE SHOULDER AND AVOID A REAR-END COLLISION.  SAME ?WRENCH? LIGHT WAS INDICATED ON DASH, SAME SEQUENCE WAS USED TO RESTART AND DRIVE OFF.  THIS OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE HAD THE SITUATION BEEN DIFFERENT, I.E. IN HIGH-SPEED LANE OR HEAVIER TRAFFIC PATTERNS.  THIS IS CERTAINLY A SAFETY CONCERN FOR DRIVING PUBLIC, BOTH THOSE IN THE F150 AND ON THE ROAD AROUND THEM.  ALMOST IDENTICAL INSTANCES CAN BE SEEN ON NHTSA SITE FOR EXACT MAKE/MODEL/YEAR TRUCK.

WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENGINE GOES TO \"IDLE\" AND THE TRANSMISSION SIMPLY COASTS. AN ORANGE WRENCH LIGHT INDICATES ON THE DASHBOARD. STOPPING THE TRUCK, SHUTTING OFF ENGINE, THEN RESTARTING THE TRUCK RESTORES OPERATION. AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT, I PHONED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID MOST LIKELY IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY CAUSING THE PROBLEM OR AS A SECOND POSSIBLE PROBLEM AREA, THE POTENTIOMETER AT THE GAS PEDAL. BOTH INCIDENTS HAPPENED ON STATE HIGHWAYS AT LIGHT TRAFFIC TIMES SO I WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF ROAD SAFELY AND RESTART VEHICLE TO RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS SYSTEM. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE EARLY MODEL ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS HAD BEEN PROBLEMATIC BUT NO RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THEM. IF THIS SYSTEM \"FAILS\" ON A VEHICLE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON AN INTERSTATE LIKE OUR 285 IN ATLANTA, GA THE RESULT COULD EASILY BE A COLLISION RESULTING IN CERTAIN INJURY IF NOT DEATH.

A TRUE NIGHTMARE! - YOU PAY FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY - BUT THEY DON'T PAY FOR THE REPAIR, YOU BUY A TRUCK FROM A DEALER, YET THEY DON'T CHECK SAFETY - ONLY TIRES, WIPERS AND SMALL STUFF.

AFTER THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I PROCEEDED THROUGH THE GREEN LIGHT AND PARKED THE TRUCK IN A SAFE SPOT OFF THE STREET.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND LIFTED THE HOOD AND THERE WAS A SMALL  ODDER OF GAS FUMES. SEEING THAT I NEEDED TO GET TO A SAFE AREA I SLOWLY DROVE THE TRUCK TO A HOTEL. THE NEXT DAY ON MONDAY AT A SLOW SPEED NO MORE THAN 25 MILES PER HR. I DROVE THE TRUCK TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I SPOKE WITH A FORD SERVICE ADVISOR. THE FORD SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A (FUEL INJECTOR NOTICE) FOR THIS YEAR MAKE AND MODEL FORD TRUCK. HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER ENGINE PROBLEMS COULD INCUR AS A RESULT OF THE BAD FUEL INJECTOR. HE SAID THAT THERE COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THAT MY MOTOR COULD (HYDROLOCK)  AND CAUSE OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE ENGINE AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER COULD BE DAMAGED.    AFTER RECEIVING THIS INFO I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP THEY SHUTTLED ME BACK TO MY HOTEL. LATER THAT DAY THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM.

(3)BENT VALVE SPRING  (4)SCORED VALVE HEAD  (5)POSSIBLE BAD CATALYTIC CONVERTER  ESTIMATED DAMAGE $4,300 AND IF CATALYTIC CONVERTER WAS DAMAGED $5,100. *TR",

THIS IS CLEARLY A WELL DOCUMENTED AND COMPLAINED ABOUT PRODUCT DEFICIENCY THAT IS ALSO A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE WHEN THE FAILURES OCCUR THE WINDOW DROPS INTO THE DOOR PANEL. MY MOST RECENT FAILURE WAS DURING A SERIOUS RAIN STORM WITH MY CHILD SITTING AT THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOW WHEN IT FAILED AND FELL INTO THE DOOR PANEL. ALTHOUGH THIS FORD DEFECT IS WIDELY DOCUMENTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS DOING NOTHING FOR IT'S CUSTOMERS. THE COST FOR POWER WINDOW REGULATOR REPLACEMENTS IN MY LESS THAN FOUR YEAR OLD 2005 F-150 (EACH DOOR HAS A DIFFERENT PART/PRICE EACH OF WHICH WAS OVER $400) HAS ALREADY EXCEEDED ALL OF MY COMBINED REPAIR COSTS FOR MY PREVIOUS F-150 OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. I HAVE BEEN A DIE HARD FORD PRODUCT BUYER (PINTO, TEMPO, GRANADA, MERCURY MARQUIS, RANGER AND THREE F-150'S) BUT QUALITY, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LOYALTY TO THE CUSTOMER NO LONGER HOLD ANY VALUE TO THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I AM ACTUALLY CONSIDERING TRADING IN MY FORD FOR A CHEVY (UGHHH) TO AVOID ANOTHER WINDOW REPAIR THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO A NEW VEHICLE PAYMENT. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, AFTER DEALING WITH THESE F-150 WINDOW PROBLEMS, IF FORD IS NOT WILLING TO CORRECT THEIR PROBLEM AND PROPERLY SUPPORT THEIR CONSUMERS I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER FORD PRODUCT.*TR",

AFTER SPENDING $102.00 ON A NEW SET OF SPARK PLUGS I RAN INTO THE PROBLEM OF THE SPARK PLUG'S LOWER HALF BREAKING INSIDE THE CYLINDER HEAD, IT TOOK ME TWO DAYS TO COMPLETE THE REPLACEMENT DUE TO A FAULTY DESIGN OF THE SPARK PLUGS. THE SPARK PLUG STEEL SHELL IS MADE OF TWO PARTS A TOP HALF THAT HAS THE THREADS MADE ONTO IT AND THE LOWER HALF THAT HAS THE HOOD WERE THE GAP IS MADE BETWEEN THE ELECTRODE AND ITSELF ALLOWING FOR A SPARK TO HAPPEN. THE PROBLEM BEING IN THAT THESE TWO PARTS ARE ONLY CRIMPED TOGETHER, THE CRIMPING IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND THE LOWER HALF DUE TO THE CARBON BUILD UP MAINTAINS ITSELF JAMMED IN THE CYLINDER HEAD WHILE THE TOP PART SLIPS AT THE CRIMPING AREA TURNS AND IS THREADED OUT CAUSING THE SEPARATION, I WAS GOING TO WELD THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER SO THAT THE NEXT TIME I HAD TO CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS THE LOWER HALF WOULD TURN WITH THE TOP HALF OF ALLOWING IT TO BREAK ITSELF FREE FROM THE CARBON BUILD UP AND NOT BREAK IN THE CYLINDER HEAD BUT DECIDED NOT TO GO WITH IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE I'LL GET RID OF THE TRUCK BEFORE THE SPARK PLUG NEED REPLACING. WELL WHAT I HOPE TO GET OUT OF THIS IS THAT FORD REVAMPS IT'S SPARK PLUG DESIGN BY EITHER WELDING THESE TWO PARTS TOGETHER OR MAKING THE SPARK PLUG SHELL A 1 PIECE SO THAT I DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN IF I DO DECIDE TO BUY ANOTHER FORD PRODUCT AFTER THE HELL I HAD TO GO THOUGH CHANGING THESE SPARK PLUGS. *TR",

THE SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED AND TOLD ME MY VEHICLE WAS READY LATE ON THE 12TH.  I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO PICKUP MY VEHICLE AND TALKED WITH THE MECHANIC THAT REPAIRED IT.  I ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID AND HE TOLD ME HE RECONNECTED A VACUUM HOSE TO THE BACK OF THE MANIFOLD AND STATED IT HAD BLOWN OFF.  I ASK HOW DID YOU SECURE IT.  HE TOLD ME BY PUSHING IT BACK ONTO THE PORT IT CAME OFF OF.  I ASK HIM WHY NOT INSTALL A CLAMP TO KEEP THIS FROM RECURRING.  HE STATED HE WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THE MANIFOLD TO ACCOMPLISH A CLAMP INSTALLATION.  BEALE LINCOLN MERCURY REPAIRED MY VEHICLE THE BEST THEY COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WHEN I DID THAT, THE VEHICLE LURCHED FORWARD TOWARD THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND HIT IT.  IT HAPPENS BECAUSE AS YOU ARE HITTING THE ACCELERATOR WHILE TRYING TO BRAKE, THE ENGINE REVS UP TO HIGH RPM, AS YOU TRY TO GET YOUR FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR, AND RELEASE THE BRAKE A BIT, THE CAR THINKS YOU WANT TO GO FAST AND TAKES OFF BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RPM.    THIS HAPPENED TO ME ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO, BUT IT JUST SEEMED LIKE AN ODDITY AT THE TIME SO I DID NOT REALLY THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL.  THEN IT HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN YESTERDAY WHEN I NEEDED TO STOP QUICKLY BECAUSE EVERYONE HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES IN FRONT OF ME, SO WHEN I WENT TO HIT MY BRAKES, I INADVERTANTLY WAS HITTING THE ACCELERATOR AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME, IT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AS I PLOWED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.

I TOLD HIM TO PUT THE TRUCK BACK TOGETHER AND WOULD TAKE TO FORD. HE STATED THAT THE REASON THEY WERE WARPING, WAS BECAUSE OF A DESIGN DEFECT WHICH DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET ENOUGH AIR TO COOL, AND IF BRAKES WERE APPLIED HARD, THEN CAUSED THEM TO WARP.    I TOOK THE TRUCK TO FORD DEALERSHIP ( JENKINS AND WYNNE IN CLARKSVILLE, TN.) INFORMED THE SERVICE WRITER. AS I WAS SPEAKING TO HIM, A TECH FROM THE SHOP WALKED IN, AND SAID THERE WAS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THEM. THEY TOOK MY TRUCK INTO THE SHOP, AND AFTER A DAY INFORMED ME THAT MY TRUCK HAD THE \"NEW AND IMPROVED BRAKES\" ALREADY INSTALLED. I ASKED HOW THEY COULD BE NEW AND IMPROVED IF DOING THE SAME AS THE OLD STYLE. THEY STATED THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME. WHEN I INQUIRED AS TO THE HOW? THE SERVICE WRITER STATED \" WE WILL MACHINE THEM.\" I TOLD HIM THAT JUST MEANS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GRIND THE ROTORS FLAT, AND THAT IT WASN'T FIXING THE ISSUE. I WOULD JUST HAVE TO HAVE A COMPLETE TOTAL BRAKE REPLACEMENT AT 40,000 MILES. HE COMMENTED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I ASKED IF THIS WAS NORMAL FOR TRUCKS TO BE COMING IN WITH WARPED ROTORS AT 20,000 MILES, AND HE JUST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS. I ASKED HIM, WHAT ARE WE AS TRUCK OWNERS SUPPOSED TO DO, REPLACE THE ROTORS EVERY 30-40,000 MILES. AGAIN HE JUST SHRUGGED AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.

ON SEPTEMBER 17TH, 2005, WAS TOWING A CARGO TRAILER OF FURNITURE AND OTHER ITEMS AND WENT TO UNLOAD SOME OF THE THINGS AT THE FIRST STOP.  I SET THE PARKING BRAKE ON THE VEHICLE SINCE I HAD BACKED UP A DRIVEWAY AND WAS PARKED ON AN INCLINE.    UPON UNLOADING CERTAIN ITEMS AT THE FIRST STOP, I PULLED THE RELEASE LEVER ON THE PARKING BRAKE AND PROCEEDED TO THE NEXT STOP, ABOUT 10 MILES AWAY.  WHILE ON THE WAY, I NOTICED A SHIMMY TO THE TRUCK AND ACTUALLY PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO SEE IF I HAD A FLAT TIRE OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM WITH EITHER THE TRUCK OR THE TRAILER I WAS TOWING.    I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING OBVIOUS AND CONTINUED TO MY DESTINATION.  WHILE BACKING THE TRUCK AND TRAILER INTO THE DRIVEWAY AT THE NEXT PLACE, I NOTICED THE REAR WHEEL ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE ONLY, WAS SMOKING.  THE WHEEL WAS TOO HOT TO TOUCH AND HAD THE SMELL OF BURNT BRAKE LINING.    AFTER CONTINUING ON MY TRIP ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO HAVE RESOLVED ITSELF.    AFTER THAT, I HAVE NOT USED THE PARKING BRAKE SINCE.  I NOTICED A SLIGHT SHAKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL SINCE THE INITIAL INCIDENT THAT OCCURS WHEN BRAKING.  THE SHAKING DOES NOT OCCUR ALL THE TIME, BUT SEEMS TO MORE PROMINENT DURING GRADUAL BRAKING.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR INSPECTION AT A FORD DEALER ON FEBRUARY 1, 2006 TO HAVE THE BRAKES LOOKED AT.  THEY SAID EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL.  NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED.  WHEN THEY TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE, THEY DID NOT NOTICE A SHIMMY OR SHAKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL DURING BRAKING.  SINCE THEN, THE SHIMMY OR SHAKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL HAS BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN BRAKING AND I AM BETTER ABLE TO TELL WHEN THIS WILL OCCUR. *JB  UPDATED 07/16/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
