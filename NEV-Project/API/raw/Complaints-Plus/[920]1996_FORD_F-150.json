        "summary": "I HAVE A 1996 FORD F-150 PICKUP TRUCK.  THE TRUCK CAUGHT ON FIRE ON APRIL 20, 2005, AT A FORD REPAIR FACILITY, WHILE IT WAS THERE FOR REPAIR.  THE FIRE INITIATED AT THE CRUISE CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH, WHICH IS LOCATED ON THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER.  ITEMS AFFECTED BY THE FIRE INCLUDED THE CRUISE CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH, THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER AND POWER BRAKE DIAPHRAGM, MELTED COVERS, HOSES AND WIRING, AND BURNED AND SCORCHED THE HOOD, PEALING A LARGE SPOT OF THE PAINT.  THE TRUCK HAS JUST 77,986 MILES.  PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DAMAGE ARE AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.    EVEN THOUGH THIS SWITCH IS THE SAME PART, IDENTIFIED WITH THE SAME PART NUMBER BY FORD, AND THE SAME DESIGN AS THAT CURRENTLY UNDER RECALL IN MODEL YEARS 2000 ? 2001, FORD HAS REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  I LEARNED ABOUT THIS DECISION FROM A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE.  THE ESTIMATED COST FOR THE REPAIRS, USING SOME USED COMPONENTS, IS ABOUT $1,000.      WHEN I CALLED THE PARTS DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE CURRENT SWITCH IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  IT WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NEW DESIGN, THE SAME AS ON THE RECALL FOR THE 2000 ? 2001 MODELS.  THE NEW PART INCLUDES A SWITCH (TRANSDUCER), AS WELL AS A JUMPER CABLE CONTAINING A NEW DIODE AND PLUG.  THE NEW PART SELLS FOR $24.29.        IT IS FORTUNATE THAT THIS FIRE OCCURRED WHILE THE UNIT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE OF THE REPAIR FACILITY.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS IF IT WERE INSIDE THE BUILDING, EXPOSING THE MECHANICS TO SMOKE AND FIRE.      THIS TRUCK IS DRIVEN BY MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND AROUND TOWN.   I HAD THE TRUCK IN FOR REPAIRS TO BE ASSURED THAT WHEN SHE STARTED COLLEGE NEXT FALL THE UNIT WOULD BE RELIABLE FOR HER.  HAD THIS SWITCH CAUSED A FIRE WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING WE COULD HAVE LOST HER.  THAT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE!     THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE UNITS THAT HAVE THIS CRUISE CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH.  TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE AT RISK.*AK",

I EXPLAINED THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD AN OIL PAN RUST THROUGH, EVER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 70-75,000 MILES ON IT.  I ASKED WHAT I SHOULD PUT ON THE OIL PAN ON MY $30,000.00 WINDSTAR TO MAKE SURE THAT OIL PAN DOES NOT RUST THROUGH, SINCE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  SHE REFUSED TO ANSWER.  MY NEIGHBOR JUST HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH HIS TRUCK.  THE REPAIR AT FORD IS 625.00.  I HAVE CALLED AROUND AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.  ONE MAN WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE AT THE EXECTIVE OFFICE TOLD ME HE HAS DEALT WITH THE SAME PROBLEM MANY TIMES.  AN OIL PAN SHOULD NOT RUST OUT LIKE THIS.  I JUST SOLD A 90 TEMPO WITH 175,000 MILES ON IT AND THE OIL PAN IS JUST FINE.  FORD IS PULLING A FAST ONE ON A LOT OF PEOPLE.  I TOLD [XXX] THAT I WOULD BE WRITING TO HER BOSS.

THE TRUCK HAS STILL NOT BEEN REPAIRED. I INSTALLED THE SPARE TIRE ON THE VEHICLE AND CALLED IT A NIGHT AND GOT US A ROOM. WHEN I ARRIVED IN GA. I WENT TO NUMEROUS TIRE DEALERS TO TRY TO FIND A MATCHING TIRE TO REPLACE BUT WAS TOLD THAT THE TIRE WAS OUT OF PRODUCTION BUT IF I LOOKED AROUND I MIGHT FIND ONE. I FINALLY DID FIND ON AT A FIRESTONE DEALER IN ATLANTA. WHEN I RETURNED TO TEXAS I IMMEDIATELY REMOVED THE REMAINING FIRESTONE TIRES BECAUSE I FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT AND REPLACED THEM WITH 4 GOODYEAR TIRES. I STILL HAVE 2 OF THE ORIGINAL TIRES AND THE ONE I BOUGHT IN GA. I BELIEVE IN THE GARAGE. I DID THINK ABOUT CALLING SOMEONE DUE TO THE DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK BUT THE FIRESTONE DEALER IN ATLANTA SAID THAT THE TIRE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND FIRESTONE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
