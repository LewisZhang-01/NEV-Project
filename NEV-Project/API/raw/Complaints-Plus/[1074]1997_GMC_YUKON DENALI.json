I TOOK IT IN AGAIN ON 10/31/2003 AND THEY REPLACED THE POWER STEERING EVO SENSOR ($213.60). STILL HAVE TROUBLE. AGAIN I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR SERVICE ON 11/19/2003 WHEN THE POWER STEERING PUMP WAS REPLACED ($648.50). THE VEHICLE STILL NG. TOOK IT IN ON 12/1/2003,CAN'T ISOLATE TROUBLE. AGAIN ON 12/10/2003, THIS TIME THEY CHANGED THE POWER STEERING BOX? SO FAR THE TROUBLE SEEMS TO BE FIXED. THEN I SAW AN ARTICLE SHOWING THE EXACT SAME TROUBLE I'D BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH OTHER GMC VEHICLES. HOWEVER, MY VEHICLE WASN'T LISTED AS ONE OF THE MODELS THEY WERE LOOKING AT.

WHILE I WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE, MY 3 YEAR OLD, MASON, CLIMBED OUT OF HIS SEAT AND JUMPED INTO THE DRIVERS SEAT AND BEGAN PLAYING WITH THE STEERING WHEEL.  HE HAD TURNED THE KEY SWITCH A FOURTH OF AN INCH, NOT EVEN TO THE FIRST CLICK (ON POSITION), AND SUCCESSFULLY PULLED DOWN THE GEAR SHIFTER INTO NEUTRAL (OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT APPLYING HIS FOOT TO THE BRAKE).  AS I WAS COMING BACK OUT OF THE HOUSE, I SEE MY CAR AND THREE CHILDREN GOING BACKWARDS DOWN MY DRIVEWAY WITH MASON BEHIND THE WHEEL, ON HIS KNEES YELLING \"UH OH, UH OH!\". I RAN, SCREAMING OUT MY CHILD\u0019S NAME, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THE DRIVER\u0019S SIDE DOOR SO HE COULDN'T FALL OUT BUT DIDN\u0019T MAKE IT IN TIME. THEY WENT STRAIGHT UP A BANK AND INTO THE WOODS PLOWING THROUGH THREE TREES. SOUNDS OF GLASS SHATTERING AND CHILDREN\u0019S CRY  SURROUNDED MY HEAD.  FINALLY, THE VEHICLE CAME TO A SUDDEN HALT.                            IT SAYS ON THE DASH OF MY VEHICLE \u001cYOU MUST APPLY BRAKE IN ORDER TO PULL OUT OF PARK\u001d.

ALSO I KNOW OF A COUPLE WHO WAS IN A SIMILAR INCIDENT, DRIVING A PENSKE RENTAL TRUCK FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO FLORIDA WHEN THE ENGINE CAUGHT FIRE.  THE FIRE INVESTIGATOR OF MY ACCIDENT FROM PALM BEACH GARDENS FIRE DEPARTMENT IN FLORIDA, DETERMINED IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL FIRE, AND GMC HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  I WAS TOLD THE YEAR OF THE TRUCK WAS 1993 BY A FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER BASED ON THE VIN, BUT GMC CLAIMS IT WAS A 1997 VEHICLE.
