WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN THE FRONT WHEELS ARE NOT TURNING, THE REAR BRAKES DO NOT ENGAGE, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU PUSH DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.     THE ISSUE PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER ICY CONDITIONS. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS WHEN I PULLED INTO A SPOT AT A FAST FOOD PLACE, THE PARKING SPOT WAS ICY WHILE THE REST OF THE LOT WAS ICE FREE. AS I PULLED INTO THE SPOT, I PUT ON MY BRAKES AND THE FRONT WHEELS STOPPED, BUT THE REAR DID NOT. THEY WERE ON THE CLEAR PART OF THE PARKING LOT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED MY FORWARD MOTION, HOWEVER THEY DID NOT. SLID AHEAD UNTIL THE FRONT HIT THE SNOW BANK.  THOUGHT THIS WAS UNUSUAL, BUT DIDN'T CONCERN MYSELF ABOUT IT ANY MORE.    NEXT TIME I BECAME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN I HAD THE REAR (BOTH) WHEELS OF THE CAR OFF THE GROUND AND I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AS I WANTED TO CHECK IF ONE OF THE REAR RIMS WAS BENT. WELL NO IT WASN'T BUT WHEN I GOT BACK IN THE CAR TO PUT IT IN PARK, I PRESSED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP THE REAR WHEELS FROM TURNING, AND THEN WENT TO PUT THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER IN PARK. BIG GRINDING NOISE. SO I PRESSED HARDER ON THE BRAKE AND TRIED TO PUT IT IN PARK AGAIN, AGAIN BIG GRINDING NOISE. SO I LOOKED AT THE REAR WHEELS WHILE PRESSING THE BRAKE, AND WHAT TO MY SURPRISE, THE REAR WHEELS DO NOT STOP! THIS CAN'T BE A GOOD THING.    TODAY AS I BACKED OUT OF THE GARAGE, THE DRIVEWAY WAS A LITTLE ICY. SO AS I BACKED UP, I PUT ON THE BRAKES, AND OF COURSE, ONLY THE FRONT WHEELS STOPPED AND THE REAR WHEELS KEPT PULLING THE CAR DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. NOT A GOOD THING IF A CAR IS PASSING BY ON THE STREET.    SO WHAT'S UP WITH THIS. YES MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE CHEV DEALER THAT IT IS FROM THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE SOMETIMES, WHEN IT IS HOT, IT WILL SHIFT HARD.",
