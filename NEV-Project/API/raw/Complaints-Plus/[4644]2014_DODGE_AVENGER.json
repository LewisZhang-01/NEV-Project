ONLINE RESOURCES REGARDING THIS FLAW ARE NOT HARD TO FIND.  ALL IT REQUIRES IS A SIMPLE SEARCH ON GOOGLE TO FIND THE HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS AND POSTINGS OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS REGARDING THE OIL FILTER HOUSING BY OWNERS OF VEHICLES USING THE 3.6L PENTASTAR V6.  THE SHEER NUMBER AND FREQUENCY OF THIS PROBLEM REINFORCES THE LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY OF THIS COMPLAINT.  THIS DESIGN FLAW HOWEVER, IS NOT ONLY SPECIFIC TO THE WEAKNESS OF THE PLASTIC CONNECTING CAP ON THE OIL FILTER HOUSING (WHICH IS PRONE TO CHIPPING AND CRACKING) BUT IN THE PLACEMENT OF THIS WEAK PART DEEP WITHIN THE ENGINE ' REQUIRING MANDATORY PROFESSIONAL MAINTENANCE TO BE ADMINISTERED.  THIS OIL FILTER HOUSING IS EFFECTIVELY A TICKING TIME-BOMB WITHIN ALL 3.6L PENTASTAR V6 ENGINES WHICH SADLY AWAITS ALL CONSUMERS. NOT ONLY IS THIS AN INCONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS ' HAVING TO PAY DEALERSHIPS $600+ TO HAVE THE PART REPLACED, BUT A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN ON MANY LEVELS.  A FEW EXAMPLES ARE: (1) THE LEAKING OF OIL CAUSED BY THE INEVITABLE CRACKING OF THE OIL FILTER HOUSING CAUSES THE ENGINE TO REACH DANGEROUS LEVELS OF HEAT AND DEGRADE AT A MUCH FASTER RATE. (2) EXPOSED OIL RESTING ON THE ENGINE NEAR THE HOUSING MAY IGNITE CAUSING AN ENGINE FIRE. (3) MORE SPECIFIC TO MY SITUATION, THE LOSS OF OIL MAY OCCUR WHILE DRIVING IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ' WHERE THE RESPONSIVENESS OF YOUR ENGINE MAY BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL.    IT IS UNFATHOMABLE TO THINK THAT AFTER THE MANY THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR INSTANCES CONSUMERS HAVE FACED REGARDING THE FLAWED PART, THAT A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN PUT INTO PLACE.
