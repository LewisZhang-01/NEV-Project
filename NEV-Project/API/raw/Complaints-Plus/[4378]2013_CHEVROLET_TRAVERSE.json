Today the vehicle shut off while driving 65 mph this morning in the fast lane. Luckily my wife put the Emergency lights on and we wasn't hit from behind but cats did brake fast and almost hit us.  So far vehicle has left me on the side on the road 3 times today.  Errors codes that are coming up is P1682 and c042-00. It also states replace ignition relay switch which I had done 3 times already.  Once this happens I have to wait 10 minutes, then restart, then shut off, then reatart, then shut off then restart until to vehicle starts up how it should start up with no hesitation or shaking. Then I can make it home   My fear is my wife will be driving and car shuts off while driving on the freeway with the kids. I know this issues was recalled with the traverse 2009 and 2010 and some other vehicle gm made.",

While driving our 2013 Chevrolet Traverse fall 2021, we experienced the passenger airbag light coming on and staying on, along with the blind spot detection system lights coming on and staying on for both side mirrors. Also, the key fob wouldn\u2019t work\u2014manually lock and unlock the vehicle. We disconnected the negative battery terminal to reset the computers, resulting in the key fob to work and the passenger airbag light to go out. The blind spot detection system continued to malfunction so we scheduled a repair appointment with our Chevrolet dealership. Prior to the appointment, we endured a frightening experience while driving our Traverse; the entire instrument panel went out along with the radio. This electrical malfunction occurred on two separate occasions. In addition, the engine light came on and the engine temperature gage did not work properly. The dealership performed two diagnostic tests 11/5/2021 determining the engine coolant sensor malfunction and blind spot detection system modules/hardness malfunction. The dealership service manager explained other electrical malfunctions such as steering wheel movement and passenger seat movement that could occur while driving our vehicle should we continue to operate our vehicle without repairing the blind spot detection system and the need to replace both modules and the electrical harness. The video showed both modules were severely corroded. He also explained there is nothing a vehicle owner can do to prevent the corrosion because the modules are placed in the rear bumper\u2014susceptible to moisture penetration and system malfunction. The repair costs was $1664. 11/30/2021 Customer Assistance Center stated by phone call, no action or reimbursement unless a recall is issued.",

The first time this happened, I was on the expressway driving about 60 MPH when the traction control light came on, the truck reduced power and completely cut off while driving. An 18 wheeler truck that had slam on breaks to keep from rear ending me. This most recent time this issue came about, While driving on a city street, suddenly the truck did the ruff idol and cut off while driving. I was almost hit by an 18 wheeler again. Thank god these 18 wheeler truck drivers had the skills to make it around me. I am so scared to drive the truck. At this point i want to get rid of it but I'm scared someone else may get my truck and have an even worse outcome.  I have had this issue so many times that I fear this will happen in a even more dangerous spot and this truck will get me killed in a really bad accident. I am Highly recommending that GM or someone look into removing this truck from the roadways of America as this is hazardous to all drivers driving safely down the road. My truck is currently being looked at by the dealer and GM. I am not looking to drive this vehicle ever again.   Some of the issues has been: Code P0107  map sensor Alternator began smoking  Stability Trak dashboard lights come on and engine looses power Traction control light comes on and truck cuts off  battery charging system light comes ruff idol and truck cuts off Under hood Fuse box will short out and cause multiple electrical issues Purge Valve broken Power steering hose went bad Coolant hose connector broke 2 times in the same spot  Please look into this issue with this model, this is very unsafe and dangerous for the road.",

TURN OFF THE ENGINE FOR A MINUTE THEN THE CAR WILL START AND OPERATE AS NORMAL FOR A FEW DAYS OR A FEW WEEKS. IN THE PAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE. I WAS DRIVING 70 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY ENGINE TOTALLY SHUT DOWN. I HAD TO AVOID A TRACTOR TRAILER IN THE RIGHT LANE AND COAST OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NO POWER STEERING. THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC. AFTER THE CAR SAT IDLE FOR A DAY IT STARTED UP. CODES WERE CLEARED AND IT RAN NORMALLY AGAIN FOR WEEKS. LAST WEEK WHILE TRAVELING AT 35 MPH ON A CITY STREET THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NO POWER STEERING, BUT STILL IMPACTING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER HELPED ME PUSH THE CAR FURTHER OFF THE ROAD ONTO THE SIDEWALK. IT WOULD NOT RESTART. I HAD IT TOWED TO MY MECHANIC. 24 HOURS LATER THE CAR STARTED OK. CODES WERE CLEARED AND IT ONCE AGAIN COULD OPERATE NORMALLY. MY MECHANIC CONSULTED TO A GM MECHANIC AND THEY AGREED THE PROBLEM IS THE IGNITION SWITCH. MY TRAVERSE HAS NOT HAD A RECALL FOR IGNITION SWITCH REPLACEMENT.  I AM AWARE THAT GM IGNITION SWITCH PROBLEMS HAVE KILLED OVER (100) GM VEHICLE OWNERS. MILLIONS OF GM CARS HAVE BEEN RECALLED AND THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED BY REPLACING THE IGNITION SWITCH, IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER AND IGNITION KEY. MANY MORE GM VEHICLES LIKE MY 2013 CHEV TRAVERSE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED OR MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.

I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND HAD THEM TOW MY TRUCK TO MY HOUSE SINCE THE DEALSHIP WAS ALREADY CLOSED.  THE NEXT MORNING, THEY TOWED IT TO THE NEAREST CHEVY DEALERSHIP. THE FOLLOWING DAY THE DEALER DIAGNOSED IT WITH A FUEL PUMP FLOW CONTROL FAILURE, AND TOLD ME IT WOULD BE $ 965.00 TO REPAIR.  I HAVE ONLY OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR 6 MONTHS, AND IT ONLY HAS, 70,000 MILES, WITH A MANUFACTURE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY STILL.  SO I CALLED GM, AND COME TO FIND OUT THERE WAS A  RECALL ON THE SAME YEAR MAKE AND MODEL AS MY SUV, FOR THE SAME PROBLEM/PART, BUT BECAUSE THE RECALL IS VIN SPECIFIC, GM WILL NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  I PUT IN A SERVICE REQUEST AND HAVE SPOKEN TO 7 DIFFERENT PEOPLE, WITH 1 SUPERVISOR ADVISING ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO TO HELP GET IT FIXED.  THAT WAS 4 DAYS AGO, NEVER HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE.  I CALLED TODAY AND THE LADY I SPOKE WITH, SAID THERE WAS NO NOTES INDICATING THAT ANYONE WAS WORKING ON A SOLUTION, OR OF ANYTHING THEY PROMISED TO DO.  THE ONLY THING SHE SAID WAS MY VEHICLE WASNT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  SO NOW I AM VERY UPSET, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE THIS WAS MY ONLY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION AND I WASN'T PROVIDED A LOANER, I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX IT.
