        "summary": "THE KENDON USA DUAL RAIL STAND-UP TRAILER FENDER SEPARATED FROM THE TRAILER WHILE TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH ON THE EXPRESSWAY, THE FENDER, WHICH IS QUITE HEAVY,  SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AND NEARLY MISSED HITTING THE WINDSHIELD OF A FOLLOWING CAR.  THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THIS OCCURRED.  ON THE PRIOR OCCASION, THE TRAILER MANUFACTURER, KENDON USA, SOLD ME A NEW REDESIGNED FENDER THAT HAD SMALL HOLES DRILLED IN THE FENDER WHERE THE CRACKS STARTED.  THE NEW DESIGN DID NOT WORK AS THAT FENDER FAILED AS WELL.  KENDON USA ADVISED THE PROBLEM WAS THE FAULT OF OWNERS WHO DID NOT TIE-DOWN THEIR MOTORCYCLE TO THE TRAILER AXLE AS DIRECTED IN THE OWNERS MANUAL; HOWEVER, THAT WAS NOT THE CAUSE IN MY INSTANCES AS THE MOTORCYCLES WERE TIED-DOWN AT THE AXLE  POINTS.  AFTER THE SECOND FENDER FAILURE, KENDON USA ADVISED THEY NO LONGER SOLD THE FENDERS AND I WOULD NEED TO HAVE A LOCAL SHOP PERFORM A WELDING REPAIR.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT KENDON USA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECALL THESE TRAILERS AND RETROFIT A PROPERLY DESIGNED FENDER BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.",
