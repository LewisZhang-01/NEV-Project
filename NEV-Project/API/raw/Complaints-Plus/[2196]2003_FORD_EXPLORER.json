WHILE DOING REPAIR THEY CALLED AGAIN AND SAID THEY FOUND THAT THE REAR TIMING CARTRIDGE WAS BROKEN AND PIECES OF IT MISSING. TOLD ME THAT BOLT WAS WORE HALF WAY THROUGH AS TIMING CHAINING WAS RUBBING IT. SAID IF IT BREAKS BEFORE REPAIR ENGINE WILL \"BLOW\" AND NEED TO BE REPLACED. TOLD ME IT WOULD COSTS OVER $2,500 TO REPLACE THIS CARTRIDGE. TOTAL COST WAS NOW OVER $4,000. I ASKED WHY PART WAS  BAD WHEN ENGINE ONLY HAD 84,000 MILES AND WHY THIS WASN'T FOUND WITH THE \"COMPLETE\" CHECK. MECHANIC STATED ONLY SAW IT BECAUSE HE HAD THINGS APART TO FIX VALVE COVER GASKETS. TOLD ME IT WAS A PLASTIC PART AND EVEN WITH LOW MILEAGE THE PLASTIC DETERIORATES WITH TIME. SAID PART ONLY DESIGNED TO LAST 100,000 MILES. IF I AM TO BELIEVE THIS FORD MECHANIC, FORD USES A PLASTIC PART IN A CRUCIAL PART OF THE ENGINE (TIMING) AND IF THAT PART FAILS THE ENGINE WILL \"BLOW\".

OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO SHIFT AT RED LIGHT OR WHILE DRIVING AND HAD MANY NEAR REAR END COLLISIONS DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE SHIFTING AND MAINTAINING SPEED. FOR OVER A DECADE THE POORLY DESIGNED SYSTEM GETS AIR BOUND RENDERING THE CLUTCH USELESS . THIS IS CAUSED BECAUSE THE HYDRAULIC LINE HAS LOW AND HIGH SPOTS AND AIR BECOMES TRAPPED IN THE HIGH SPOTS AND RESULTS IN LOSS OF CLUTCH OPERATION . THE ENTIRE SYSTEM MUST BE REMOVED AND ELONGATED TO ALLOW AIR TO BE RELEASED FROM SYSTEM . NO BLEEDER VALVE AT MASTER CYLINDER  FOR ONE THING . THERE IS A BLEEDER VALVE AT THE SLAVE CYLINDER BUT BECAUSE THE LINE HAS MANY TWIST AND TURNS WITH HIGH SPOTS BLEEDING DOES NOT ELIMINATE AIR TRAPPED IN HIGH SPOTS . THIS IS A WELL KNOW PROBLEM AND A DANGEROUS ONE . FORD COULD CARE LESS . ITS ABOUT TIME FORD ANSWERS AND MODIFIES THIS FAULT . YOU NEED ONLY GO ONLINE AND ENTER FORD RANGER HARD SHIFTING PROBLEMS AND YOU WILL SEE IT IS COMMON PLACE PROBLEM .  OF COURSE AFTER THE 36 K WARRANTY THIS BECOMES A COMMON PROBLEM AND FORD TURNS THERE CHEEK . I CANT TELL YOU HOW FRUSTRATING TO BE AT A RED LIGHT AND UNABLE TO SHIFT ALONG WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIFT AT HIGH SPEEDS WITH CARS RUNNING UP YOUR REAR . PLEASE ADDRESS THIS BEFORE LIFE IS LOST . THANK YOU . I URGE ALL RANGER OWNERS TO GET ON BOARD.  *TR",

I SHUT IT OFF, TURNED IT BACK ON-NO LIGHT WAS ON-PROCEEDED DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND THE LIGHT TURNS BACK ON AND IT WILL NOT SHIFT AND IS STRAINING SHIFT. I TOOK IT IN TO JIFFY LUBE TO GO AHEAD AND GET ANOTHER OIL CHANGE AND LET THEM CHECK THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCESS IT TO CHECK THE FLUID-THEY SUGGESTED A TRANSMISSION FLUSH AT $200-WHY CAN'T THEY ACCESS IT? WOULDN'T A DIP STICK SAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE? AS I LOOK AT ALL THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION TROUBLES IN THE EXPLORERS, I AM VERY SHOCKED. PLEASE CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE AS I CANNOT AFFORD HIGH MAINTENANCE BILLS THAT WOULD BE CHARGED THROUGH A DEALER. JUST TELL ME IF THERE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO FIXING IT SO THAT MY BROTHER MAY REPAIR IT AND GET IT BACK ON THE ROAD.  ONE RESPONSE IS AS SUCH:  AFTER TALKING TO 2 FORD REPS TODAY, AND TURNED DOWN FLAT FOR HELP, I HAVE DECIDE ITS NOW A QUEST.... FORD STATED THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS FOR THE NHTSA TO OPEN UP AN INVESTIGATION TO POSSIBLY ORDER A RECALL...... SOOOO, FOR ALL THOSE THAT HAVE ISSUES, CALL FORD AND ALSO MAKE A COMPLAINT ON THE NHTSA SITE WWW.NHTSA.GOV OR CALL THEM AT 1-800-424-9393. MY FAMILY IS A FORD FAMILY AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE 5 FORDS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD, A MUSTANG, FORD F150, FORD FOCUS, EXPEDITION, AND THE EXPLORER THAT IS HAVING ISSUES. THIS ISN'T INCLUDING EXTENDED FAMILY. FORD IS ABOUT TO LOSE FUTURE BUSINESS....   *TR",

THE ROD AS WELL AS THE GEARS, SOLENOID, AND THE TORQUE CONVERTER HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST OF THIS REPAIR WAS 1700 DOLLARS.  SHOULD MY TRANSMISSION BE GOING OUT THIS SOON?

AS THIS PART SITS CLOSE TO THE FUEL TANK, THE PIECE OF SPRING THAT BROKE OFF COULD HAVE EASILY PUNCTURED THE FUEL TANK RESULTING IN POSSIBLE FIRE. IT COULD ALSO HAVE WEDGED AGAINST A BRAKE LINE, THUS CAUSING A BRAKE FAILURE AND/OR SUSPENSION FAILURE/MISALIGNMENT CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL AND AN ACCIDENT.  IN ADDITION, IF THE PIECE OF SPRING, WEIGHING ABOUT THREE (3) POUNDS HAD FALLEN OUT, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO A FOLLOWING VEHICLE OR IT'S OPERATOR HAD IT BOUNCED UP AND PENETRATED A WINDSHIELD.  THE REASON FOR THE LAPSE IN TIME IN MY REPORTING THIS CONDITION IS BECAUSE I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS JUST A ONE TIME ISOLATED FAILURE TO MY VEHICLE. HOWEVER, IN TALKING TO OTHER FORD EXPLORER OWNERS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL AUTO REPAIR SHOPS, I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON FAILURE ON SIMILAR VEHICLES.   IF THIS WAS A SIMPLE REPAIR TO A COMPONENT THAT HAD LITTLE OR NO AFFECT ON THE VEHICLES PERFORMANCE OR DID NOT PRESENT A SAFETY CONDITION, I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY JUST WRITTEN IT OFF TO NORMAL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.

WELL HAD TO PULL THE MOTOR, REPLACED GUIDES, CASSETTES, AND TENSIONERS, WITH 2000.00 JUST IN PARTS ALONE. HAD CAR BACK FROM MECHANIC NOT EVEN 3 WEEKS AND ENGINE STARTED KNOCKING AS IF A ROD WAS KNOCKING. WENT BACK TO MECHANIC AND TENSIONERS WERE THE CAUSE OF TIMING-CHAIN \"CLANK\". APPARENTLY THEY (FORD) DESIGNED THESE TENSIONERS WITH \"PLASTIC\" GUIDES WHICH SHRED OFF INTO THE HYDRAULIC TENSIONER PICK UP TUBE THEREFORE CLOGGING UP THE HOLE FOR OIL TO GET TO CHAIN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNLESS YOU GET UPDATED TENSIONERS DIRECTLY FROM FORD AT 100.00 EACH. THERE ARE 3 TIMING CHAINS AND MULTIPLE TENSIONERS AS WELL, WHICH CONTINUE TO GO OUT AFTER 30,000 MILES AND NEED REPLACING, WHICH MOST CAN BE REPLACED WITH MOTOR IN BUT SOME CANT THEREFORE I HAVE HAD MOTOR OUT TWICE NOW, AT 2500.00 EACH TIME. THERE WAS AN ONP TO OWNERS BUT FORD WOULD ONLY COVER  COST UP TO 100,000 MILES AND ONLY IF OWNERS COMPLAINED!! OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT FIX!!! WELL THIS IS A BAD DESIGN ON FORDS PART WITH PLASTIC TENSIONERS TO GUIDE YOUR TIMING CHAIN!!! NOW THEY HAVE UPDATED WITH A TOUGHER NYLON \"PLASTIC\". BUT HAVE NOT RECALLED THE OLD ONES SO UNLESS YOU ORDER DEALER PARTS YOU RECEIVE THE OLD PARTS WHICH ARE NO GOOD AND WILL END UP MAKING YOU SPEND MORE MONEY AND FOR THE LAST 12MONTHS, I HAVE HAD MY CAR 3 WEEKS DUE TO CANT AFFORD THE ENORMOUS REPAIR BILL, WHICH FORD KNEW ABOUT ALL ALONG, BUT FAILED TO RECALL PLASTIC PARTS UNLESS SOMEONE COMPLAINED.

AFTER SOME INSPECTION, THE REPAIRMAN DETERMINED THAT I HAD BLOWN A FUSE. THE CAUSE WAS MY ABS SENSOR CONTINUALLY SENDING OUT AN PROBLEM SIGNAL. THE CAUSE OF THAT WAS MY WHEEL BEARINGS GOING BAD. FURTHER INSPECTION SHOWED THAT AT LEAST THREE OF MY WHEELS HAVE BAD BEARINGS. THE REPAIRS ARE INCREDIBLY COSTLY (WELL OVER $1,000).

I WAS TOLD I COULD PAY $1,000.00 TO HAVE IT REPAIRED OR PUT CAULKING ON IT TO HELP TO SEAL THE CRACK. I PUT THE CAULKING ON IT AS I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED. I AM RETIRED AND ON A FIXED INCOME.  OVER THE COURSE OF TIME THE CRACK WIDENED CAUSING THE PANEL  AND WINDOW TO SHIFT TO THE LEFT.  ON MONDAY 4/12/10  I OPENED THE HATCHBACK WINDOW TO PLACE A FEW ITEMS INSIDE AND THE WINDOW CAME CRASHING DOWN ON MY HEAD ALMOST DRIVING ME INTO THE GROUND. THE HINGES BROKE AND HAD A FRIEND NOT BEEN THERE WITH ME I COULD NOT HAVE LIFTED THAT WINDOW. HE AND I WORKED FOR 45 MINUTES TO GET IT PLACED BACK TO WHERE IT WAS NOT HANGING AND HAD TO PUT BUNGY CORDS ON TO HOLD IT IN PLACE. I HAVE HAD A HEADACHE FOR 3 DAYS NOW. I DROVE RIGHT OVER TO A FORD DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOOK MY INFORMATION AND CONTACTED THE WARRANTY COMPANY WHO GOT BACK TO HIM AND STATED THEY WOULD REPLACE THE HINGES. I TOLD HIM THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!! THIS CRACK HAS WIDENED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THE HATCHBACK HAS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT. REPLACING THE HINGES IS A TEMPORARY FIX. LIKE PUTTING A BANDAID ON A COMPOUND FRACTURE!  I THINK THE ENTIRE HATCHBACK HAS WEAKENED AND IF THE BIG DOOR FALLS ON ME I COULD BE KILLED.

I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF IT BUT CAN'T IN CLEAR CONSCIENCE DUMP IT ON SOME OTHER POOR BUGGER.  THIS CAR HAS SUFFERED FROM EVERY PROBLEM FROM FLASHING ABS TO DIFF TO TRANSMISSION.

IT CAN BE FIXED FOR $3,000 PLUS TAX ESTIMATE, BUT THE FORD DEALERSHIP RECOMMENDS AGAINST THIS AND SAYS IT NEEDS A NEW ENGINE /REFURBISHED ENGINE $5,000 PLUS TAX. FORD REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS IS A DEFECT, DESPITE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS I HAVE SEEN ON THE INTERNET. THE CAR WAS A FORD EXPLORER 2003 WITH ONLY 60,720 ON THE CLOCK. I BOUGHT IT NEW AND MAINTAINED IT WELL. I STILL HAVE PAYMENTS ON IT SO AM SELLING IT FOR $2000 TO COVER THE PAYMENTS. IT WAS A $34,000 CAR. *TR",

AT ABOUT 6:10PM THE SAME DAY I WENT OUT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE BACK AND I SAW IT. THERE IS 2 CRACKS THE UPPER PART OF THE HATCH IN TO THE LEFT OF THE FORD EMBLEM. ONE STARTS AT THE WINDOW AND GOES DOWN THE OTHER STARTS AT THE BOTTOM AND GOES UP.

I CONTACTED APPLE FORD (LYNCHBURG VA) ON 5-15-09 AND WAS INSTRUCTED THEY HAD SEEN MANY CASES OF THIS BUT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL FORD PUTS OUT A RECALL. I THEN CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND WAS INSTRUCTED THEY WILL NOT FIX IT BUT TO HAVE A DEALER LOOK AT IT. MY CONCERN IS IF THE WINDOW FALLS OUT BECAUSE OF THIS WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO TO MY 1 YEAR OLD AND 3 YEAR OLD IN THE BACK SEAT OR THE PEOPLE IN THE CARE BEHIND ME ON THE ROAD. I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IT IS A DEFAULT FROM THE COMPANY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE HARM.

AFTER TALKING TO OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME MODEL, I BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT BODY SHOP OWNERS ARE INFORMING THEM THAT THIS IS A COMMON DEFECT IN THAT MODEL.  SINCE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM, A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED AND THE OWNER SHOULD HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED BY FORD.  MY DEALER HAS SAID FORD HAS NOT ISSUED ANY RECALL ON THIS ISSUE.  WHY HAS THIS NOT HAPPENED?   IN ADDITION, THE ALUMINUM HOOD IS NOW SHOWING BUBBLING UNDER THE PAINT, AND THE PAINT IS BEGINNING TO PEEL OFF THE HOOD.  IT IS APPARENT FORD HAS EITHER HAD SOME DEFECTIVE PAINT DELIVERED TO THEIR PLANTS, OR THEIR IS AN ENGINEERING DEFECT ALONG WITH A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT HAS CAUSED THESE PROBLEMS.  THIS IS FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY, NOT THE OWNER, AND SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY OR RECALL REGARDLESS OF THE PROBLEM SOURCE.

WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE STALLING OR NOT STARTING IN COLD TEMPERATURES OR WHEN IT IS HUMID OR DAMP OUTSIDE.   THEY HAVE REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER TWICE AND REPLACED VARIOUS SENSORS.

WHEN I REPORTED 79K MILES THEY SAID SORRY, THE CUT-OFF FOR ASSISTANCE WAS 75K MILES.  I ARGUED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS LOGGED AT 40K MILES WITH NUMEROUS FOLLOW-UP CALLS. THEY REFUSED. I CALLED THE 1-800 ASSISTANCE NUMBER AGAIN AND GOT A REAL BONEHEAD. SHE CONFIRMED THAT 75K MILES WAS THE CUT-OFF. I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I HAD PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED MY COMPLAINT, GIVING HER HIS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. SHE REFUSED. I HUNG UP AND DIALED THE 1-800 NUMBER AGAIN. THIS TIME I GOT A KIND LADY WHO TOLD ME THAT THE FIELD ENGINEER HAD  THE AUTHORITY TO OFFER COMPENSATION. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT AND THEN LEARNED THAT THE FIELD ENGINEER HAD BACKED OUT OF THE DEAL AND I WAS ABOUT TO FORK OVER $700 FOR REPLACEMENT.

I DIDN'T WORRY AT FIRST, SINCE I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. MY EXPLORER IS JUST UNDER 5 YEARS OLD AND JUST UNDER 60K MILES. SURELY THERE WOULD AT LEAST BE A 60K POWER TRAIN WARRANTY. NO ONE WOULD BUY A VEHICLE IF THEY KNEW THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ONLY LAST 59K MILES.    WELL, THE DEALER TOLD ME A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS NEEDED (5TH AND 2ND GEARS WERE WORN DOWN), THAT IT WOULD COST $3500, AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY HE CHARGED ME $90 TO TELL ME THE TRANSMISSION WAS BAD (SOMETHING I OBVIOUSLY KNEW) - ISN'T THIS SIMILAR TO STEALING?    I THEN ASKED HIM WHAT TRADE IN VALUE I COULD GET (NOT THAT I REALLY WOULD BUY ANOTHER POOR QUALITY FORD, BUT I WANTED TO EXPLORE ALL OPTIONS). $5500 IS THE MOST THEY COULD GIVE. I LAUGHED - SINCE I HAD TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF THE VEHICLE. IT TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT THE VEHICLE EITHER - SO MUCH FOR THEM REALLY STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. THEY KNOW THE QUALITY IS POOR.    OBVIOUSLY I WAS QUITE IRRITATED. I ASKED WHAT CAUSED THIS. NONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES APPLIED SINCE I TOOK GOOD CARE OF THE VEHICLE AND HAD IT SERVICED ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL. IN FACT, THE DEALER (COVER FORD IN AUSTIN) DID THE 30K CHECKUP. I SPENT $1K ON THAT (AND PROBABLY GOT RIPPED OFF).    I TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST AND HAD IT FIXED FOR UNDER $2500. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE SEES A LOT OF ISSUES LIKE THIS WITH EXPLORERS - PROBABLY A POOR DESIGN AND POOR QUALITY. ALSO, JUDGING BY VARIOUS WEBSITES THERE ARE INDEED LOTS OF COMPLAINS LIKE THIS.  *TR",

MY WIFE AND I KNEW WE HAD NOT HAD ANY TYPE OF IMPACT IN THAT AREA THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE PANEL TO CRACK.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH A SERVICE TECHNICIAN ABOUT IT.  SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS JUST OVER 3 YEARS OLD AND HAVE JUST OVER 30K MILES ON IT, THE CRACKED PANEL WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  HOWEVER, THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SEEN A NUMBER OF THESE PROBLEMS AND IT WAS CAUSED BY THE WAY THE PANEL WAS ATTACHED.    I HAD THE CRACK REPAIRED - COST OVER $400.  I SENT A LETTER TO THE FORD CUSTOMER RESPONSE CENTER IN DETROIT WITH PICTURES AND COPIES OF THE REPAIR INVOICE ASKING THEM TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPAIR COST.  AFTER 30 DAYS, I HAD NOT HEARD FROM THEM.  SO I SENT COPIES OF THE LETTER BY CERTIFIED MAIL TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP, THE CUSTOMER RESPONSE  CENTER AND TO THE CEO OF FORD.  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME AND SAID THIS WAS A FORD PROBLEM, NOT A DEALERSHIP PROBLEM, SO THE DEALERSHIP WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY ACTION.  I FINALLY RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE FORD CUSTOMER RESPONSE CENTER, AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF I WOULD ACCEPT A 50% REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIR.  I AGREED ONLY TO FIND OUT THE NEXT DAY FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROBLEM COULD BE FOUND ALL OVER THE INTERNET.  I AM VERY UPSET THAT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY COULD BE SO UNETHICAL TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT THAT IS CLEARLY EVIDENT A DESIGN FLAW.

I ALSO THINK A CLASS ACTION SUIT SHOULD BE  BROUGHT AGAINST FORD SEEKING COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR FAILING TO REIMBURSE FOR THE REPAIR AND ACTING UNETHICALLY BY TRYING TO PLACE SOME OF THE BLAME ON THE OWNERS BY TRYING TO NEGOTIATE THE REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT FOR A FLAW THAT IS CLEARLY THEIR OWN FAULT.",

VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP AT THE DEALERSHIP BY MY WIFE. ON THE 13TH OF FEBUARY SHE WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK (ABOUT 3-5 MILES) SHE CALLED ME ON HER CELL PHONE AND SAID SHE COULD HEAR NOISES, SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING AND THE REAR OF THE CAR WAS MOVING AROUND AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS LOW. I TOLD HER TO PROCEED HOME WITH CAUTION. WHEN SHE  ARRIVED HOME I LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE, AND NOTED THE LH REAR WHEEL ASSEMBLY WAS AT A 30 DEG ANGLE. I CALLED DICK EDWARD FORD AND THEY INFORMED ME TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. TODAY THEY IMPLIED IT WAS A BEARING FAILURE.   I LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE, SPOKE TO THE MECHANIC AND I NOTED IT WAS A REAR AXLE SHAFT RETENTION NUT MALFUNCTION. THE NUT HAD BACKED OUT ON THE AXLE TO THE POINT THAT THE ASSEMBLY WAS ABOUT DEPART FROM THE VEHICLE. THE MECHANIC WANTED TO BLAME THE AXLE BEARING, WHICH WAS DESTROYED.  THIS NUT IF IMPROPERLY TORQUED, OR THE ASSEMBLY IS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY PRIOR TO TORQUING THE NUT, THE NUT CAN BECOME LOOSE AND BACK OFF, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS RH THREAD, THERE IS NOT A COTTER PIN OR ANYTHING HOLDING THIS THING TOGETHER, ONLY A TORQUED NUT. THEY THEN TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR IT AS IT WAS A COINCIDENCE THIS HAPPENED. I REFUSE TO PAY. I HAVE PICTURES OF THE VEHICLE SETTING IN MY DRIVEWAY. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PICTURES AT THE DEALERSHIP WHEN IT WAS TAKEN APART. IF MY LOVED  ONE HAD BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE DOING 70 MPH THIS WOULD HAVE PROBABLY HAVE ALLOWED THE WHEEL ASSEMBLY TO DEPART FROM THE VEHICLE RESULTING IN A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT. AND POSSIBLE DEATH TO HER AS WELL AS OTHERS. HOW MANY OTHER VEHICLES OUT THERE WITH THE SAME POOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ? *JB",

THE SECOND COMPLAINT IS REGARDING THE GEAR SHIFTER NOT GOING INTO PARK EASILY.  I HAVE TO JIGGLE IT TO INTO PARK.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT NOT PROPERLY ENGAGE PARK AND MY VEHICLE MIGHT ROLL.  THIRDLY, MY REAR LIFT GATE TRIM HAS HAD TO BE REPAIRED AT LEAST 3 TIMES.

THIS CONCERNS ME B/C I FREQUENTLY UTILIZE THE LIFT GATE TO RETRIEVE GROCERIES AND OTHER ITEMS AND DO NOT WANT THE WINDOW TO FAIL AND FALL ON MY HEAD.  THE REMAINDER CONCERNS ARE REGARDING THE FUNCTION OF MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE 3 OF THE WINDOW MOTORS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.

I WENT TO THE IMPOUND LOT WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS STORED AND MET THE FATHER OF THE DECEASED CHILD. HE WAS COLLECTING PROPERTY FROM THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE. HE SHOWED ME A STROLLER AND THE CAR SEAT. THE STROLLER HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE VEHICLE AND WAS DAMAGED AND THE CAR SEAT WAS STILL INSIDE THE VEHICLE. THIS CAR SEAT AND STROLLER ARE SOLD AS A SET FROM K-MART AND HAD BEEN PURCHASED IN NOVEMBER OF 2005 IN HUTCHINSON KANSAS. UPON LOOKING AT THE CAR SEAT WHICH WAS REAR FACING IN THE VEHICLE AND STILL STRAPPED IN THE VEHICLE BY THE SEAT BELT. I WAS INFORMED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS TRAINED TO INSTALL CHILD SAFETY SEATS SAID THE SEAT WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY. MY CONCERN OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THAT THE STRAP THAT WOULD HAVE GONE OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE CHILD WAS COMPLETELY UNDONE FROM THE LATCH ON THE BACK OF THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT. THE STRAP ON THE LEFT SHOULDER WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNDONE AND I PHOTOGRAPHED THE ROUTING OF THE STRAP BEFORE REMOVING THE SEAT FROM THE VEHICLE. THE OWNER OF THE SEAT GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION OFF OF THE SEAT. MODEL # 22-300-SWB; 11/10/04 GBIB. REG NO PA-25334(CN) PERMIT # 1780-333  DOREL JUVENILE GROUP INC.

OIL CHANGE, FLUSH AND TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE/CHECK WAS IN ORDER.  $500 LATER I AM OUT THE DOOR.  25 DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL VISIT I AM BACK AT FORD WITH CONCERNS ABOUT MY TRANSMISSION.  IT SEEMS TO BE WHINING AND REVVING HIGH WHILE CHANGING INTO 2ND AND OR 5TH GEAR.  THE FLUID ALL OVER MY DRIVEWAY CERTAINLY DIDN'T GIVE ME A COMFORTABLE FEELING.

ON OCTOBER 3 END OF BUSINESS DAY, I CALLED.  THEY SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN MY VEHICLE AND WOULD WORK ON IT THE NEXT DAY.  TUESDAY I GET A CALL IN THE MID MORNING STATING THAT I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION OR A REBUILT ONE .  PRICING RANGES FROM $2600 TO $3400.

I WAS INFORMED THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY SINCE IT WAS A RESULT OF MY CONTINUING TO DRIVE IT WITH A BAD CO2 DETECTOR. THE EGR SENSOR COST ME $300 TO GET REPLACED. A WEEK AFTER THIS \"REPAIR\" WAS MADE, I BEGAN THE TRIP BACK TO TN. 2 HOURS INTO THE TRIP, THE SUDDEN, DRASTIC ACCLERATION STARTED AGAIN, AND SOON WAS OCCURING SEVERAL TIMES EVERY 30 MINUTES.

I   GET THE OIL CHANGED RELIGIOUSLY AND RECENTLY HAD THE 30,000 MILE 4WD   LUBRICATION PACKAGE FROM GOODYEAR FOR APPROX. $500. AT 34,000MI MY  WIFE BEGAN TO NOTICE A NON-DESCRIPT NOISE IN THE REAR END, A RUMBLE AT  SLOW SPEEDS WHILE TURNING. SHE CARRIES THINGS IN THE BACK AND THOUGHT THEY  WERE ROLLING AROUND. I DROVE THE CAR AT 36,600 MI AND ALSO NOTICED THE  NOISE BUT WE HAD A LOW REAR TIRE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TIRE PRESSURE. THE  TIRE ACTUALLY PICKED UP A NAIL AND WENT FLAT AND I BROUGHT THE TIRE TO GOODYEAR   FOR REPAIR. AFTER THE REPAIR THE REAR END NOISE PERSISTED ONLY AT LOW  SPEEDS AND WE FINALLY GOT THE CAR IN TO GOODYEAR FOR EVALUATION AT  38,000 MILES. THEY REPLACED THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL FLUID AGAIN AND THE NOISE   PERSISTED. THEY THEN WENT ON LINE AND PULLED A TECHNICAL SERVICE  BULLETIN TSB 04-17-5 WHICH WAS FOR LIMITED SLIP AXLE CHATTER, SHUDDER, BINDING  SENSATION OR VIBRATION DURING LOW SPEED TURNING MANEUVERS IN 2002-2004   FORD EXPLORERS, 2003-2004 EXPEDITIONS AND 2004 F-150S. THIS WAS  EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING.    SINCE THIS VEHICLE IS NOT USED OFF ROAD, IS NOT USED TO TOW ANYTHING HEAVY, IS PAMPERED BUT DOES GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGHWAY MILES 38,000MI IN 19 MONTHS, I FELT THAT HAVING A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AT THIS STAGE WAS UNUSUAL.      WELL, AFTER TALKING TO MY MANAGER AT WORK, HALF THE FORD EXPLORER  FLEET IN BOSTON WAS HAVING THIS PROBLEM, WITH ONE VEHICLE IN THE SHOP 3 MONTHS  AND ONE NEVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY YET.  THE TSB NOTED PROBLEMS WITH THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION. WHAT ABOUT NEXT TIME??   MY VEHICLE. VEHICLE # [XXX]  FORD EXPLORER  SILVER  V8 NBX   VERSION?

I WAS TOLD THAT THE ABS PROBABLY LOCKED UP BECAUSE THE STREET MAY HAVE BEEN WET, WHICH IT WAS NOT.  THEN THEY SAID THAT MAYBE I WAS ON A GRAVEL OR DIRT ROAD, WHICH I WAS NOT.  I WAS TOLD TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT AGAIN.  IF THERE IS A NEXT TIME, I HOPE THERE WILL NOT BE ANYONE INJURED.",

EITHER WAY, ITS NOT LOCKING UP TO DO A 1:1 CONVERSION FOR OVERDRIVE TO SAVE ON GAS & PREVENT OVERHEATING OF THE TRANSMISION. THEY TOLD ME TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO A FORD DEALERSHIP. I WENT TO PURVIS FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT & THEY DID THEIR OWN DIAGNOSIS. PURVIS FORD FOUND THAT THE CONVERTER IS BAD & COMING APART. THEY ALSO SAID IT WAS OVERHEATING & THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION FOR MY VEHICAL FOR THAT YEAR WAS A BAD TRANSMISSION. ALSO THEY'VE HAD CUSTOMERS W/ THIS EXACT PROBLEM W/ AS LITTLE AS 100 MILES & SOME W/ AS MUCH AS 100,000 MILES.

FACTS:  A)  WHEN MY DAUGHTER (12 YEARS; 89 LBS.) LEANED FORWARD IN HER SEAT, PRESSURE WAS PLACED ON SEAT BELT CAUSING RELEASE TO ENGAGE AND JERK FORWARD;   B) MY DAUGHTER WAS STILL IN  SEAT BELT WHEN I PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF ROAD TO CHECK ON HER; C) I WAS REPEATEDLY UNABLE TO GET THE BACK OF HER SEAT TO \"LOCK IN\" PLACE;  D)  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I FOUND SEAT BELT TO BE LODGED SECURELY BEHIND SEAT RELEASE AND EACH TIME MY DAUGHTER MOVED FORWARD AND PLACED PRESSURE ON SEAT BELT, THE RELEASE WAS ENGAGED;  E)  THIS INCIDENT WASN'T THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT; E) BRAKES WEREN'T BEING USED AT TIME; F)  SHE WAS SEEN IN EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO PAIN IN HER NECK. BACK AND HEAD; SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A CERVICAL STRAIN AND HAD TO WEAR A NECK COLLAR FOR FIVE DAYS.  3.  CONTRIBUTING REASONS FOR OCCURRENCE: A)  SEAT BELT IS SECURED TO SIDE OF  VEHICLE; B) WHEN A PERSON GETS INTO THIRD ROW SEAT, IT'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT ON THE SEAT BELT CAUSING IT TO HANG BEHIND SEAT RELEASE; (C)  IF SEAT BELT DOESN'T RETRACT PROPERLY, IT CATCHES BEHIND SEAT RELEASE; D) IT CAN ALSO CATCH ON FRONT OF RELEASE.  4.  ADDITIONAL CONCERNS: A) SECOND SEAT RELEASE IS A TWO STEP RELEASE: IF THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE THE BRAKES HAD TO BE APPLIED QUICKLY AND FIRMLY, SECOND PART OF  RELEASE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY ENGAGED CAUSING MY DAUGHTER TO BE STRUCK FROM BEHIND AND THROWING HER FORWARD CAUSING HER TO STRIKE THE FRONT OF HER HEAD ON THE BACK OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT WHICH IMPACT COULD HAVE QUITE LIKELY CAUSED ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  5.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION WHICH COULD CAUSE CATASTROPHIC RESULTS IF NOT CORRECTED IN ALL EXPLORERS EQUIPPED WITH THIS TYPE OF SEAT BELT AND SEATING ARRANGEMENT.
