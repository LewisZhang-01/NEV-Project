I have a claim opened with USAA but during simple research, I have found tens, if not close to a hundred issues with similar characteristics. I know I am not the first R53 Mini Cooper (2002-2006 run) with this problem and this should be considered a hazard and public safety issue.

IT DRAINS THE BATTERY COMPLETELY SO I HOOKED UP MY BATTERY CHARGER TO IT OVERNIGHT.    AFTER PERFORMING SOME GOOGLE RESEARCHING ON THIS SUBJECT MATTER, I REALIZED MINI HAD ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE EHPS SYSTEM IN 2013 AND LATER SUPERSEDED BY THE RECALL 15V-660. UNFORTUNATELY MY PRODUCTION DATE (AUGUST OF 05) DOES NOT FALL IN THE RANGE OF THE RECALL. THE RECALL COVERS PRODUCTION BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2001 TO FEBRUARY 2005.     FURTHER READING ON THIS ISSUE, MANY OWNERS EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE SUCCESS ON CLEANING THE DUST INSIDE THE PUMP TO SOLVE THE SHORTING ISSUE WITHIN THE PUMP. SO I DISCONNECT THE BATTERY, REMOVED THE PUMP FROM THE CAR AND START TAKING THE PUMP APART. AFTER REMOVING THE COVER, I REALIZED THE SHORT HAD ALREADY MELTED DOWN ONE OF THE BRUSH (THE GOLD COLOR PIECE IN IMG_9730) AND SOME OTHER COMPONENTS INSIDE THE PUMP.     MY RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THIS PUMP IS THE EXACT SAME ONE THAT WAS USED AS THE RECALL ONE, BMW PART NUMBER 6769961-02 (IMG_9733). LATER ON THE PART NUMBER CHANGED TO 6769961-03. SO I WONDERED WHY MY CAR ISN'T PART OF THE US RECALL. I ALSO FOUND THAT THE TRANSPORT CANADA RECALL #2012029 DOES PROVIDE EXTENDED WARRANTY (12 YEARS / 200K KM) ON THE PUMP AND PUMP COOLING FAN FOR ALL 2002-2005 COOPER AND COOPER S IN CANADA.    I HOPE SOMEONE CAN FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD ISSUE FOR ALL AFFECTED PRODUCTION UNITS THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE RECALL.

TALKING TO THE DEALER, THEY MADE ME FEEL FORTUNATE THAT MY WATER PUMP MADE IT TO 50,000 MILES STATING THEY REPLACE MANY WATER PUMPS IN THE 1ST GENERATION SERIES AROUND 20,000 MILES. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS IS DANGEROUS, AS THE FAILURE CAN CAUSE OVERHEATING AND REQUIRES YOU TO SHUT OFF THE CAR, AND SIT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. CARS ARE NOT MADE TO OVER HEAT. THIS GREATLY INCREASES THE CHANCE OF A FIRE. BMW KNOWS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT IS NOT RECALLING THE WATER PUMPS UNTIL 2006-2011.

I TOOK MY MINI, WHICH WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY IN FOR SERVICE TO BMW/MINI OF SAN ANTONIO AND WAS REASSURED THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING NORMAL SHIFTING MECHANICS.

I BEGAN TAKING MY CAR INTO A BMW/MINI CERTIFIED SHOP IN AUSTIN, TX. AFTER MUCH TIME, MONEY, AND TROUBLE, PLUS MANY VISITS TO THE MECHANIC, MY MINI COOPER'S CONDITION DETERIORATED COMPLETELY.

HOWEVER, NOT LONG AFTER THE WARRANTY RAN OUT, I HAD PROBLEMS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITH MY STEERING WHEEL SEIZING UP BUT AN INCIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2012 STICKS OUT MOST IN MY MIND SINCE I WAS ON I-95 IN THE RAIN AND COULD NOT ADEQUATELY STEER THE CAR TO TAKE AN EXIT.  MY 11 YR OLD DAUGHTER WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME.  I PULLED TO THE SHOULDER AND SHUT THE CAR OFF AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART AND RESUME DRIVING.  FINANCIALLY, I COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE THE CAR INTO THE DEALER BUT THE CONDITION AND WORK AROUND CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY FOR A FEW WEEKS WHEN I COULD AFFORD THE REPAIR.  IN EARLY MAY 2012, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR AND IT COST OVER $1300 TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING PUMP.  AT THE TIME OF THE REPAIR, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE COOLING FAN ALSO NEEDED REPAIR FOR ANOTHER $720 -- I JUST DIDN'T HAVE IT.  TODAY, MY 2-YR OLD BATTERY FAILED APPARENTLY DUE TO DRAINING FROM THE FAN.  FOR NOW, I REPLACED THE BATTERY FOR $249.  I WILL BE INCREMENTALLY GETTING REPAIRS DONE, HOWEVER, IN READING SOME PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE STEERING PUMP, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME RELEVANCE BETWEEN THE PUMP GOING BAD AND AN IMPACT ON THE FAN.  I'D APPRECIATE ANY INSIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE ON THAT POSSIBILITY.  I AM REPORTING THIS NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR OTHERS WHO ALSO MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE PUMP DEFECT THAT I AM LEARNING IS SOMEWHAT COMMON.  I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OUTCOME OF YOUR ENGINEERING ANALYSIS.

THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE POWER STEERING FAN SEIZING AND THEREFORE IT WAS NOT COOLING THE POWER STEERING PUMP. AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION OF MY OWN, I FOUND OUT THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WAS THE LOW FAN SPEED RESISTOR FAILED ON THE ENGINE COOLING FAN. THE POWER STEERING FAN WILL ONLY ACTIVATE ONCE THE ENGINE COOLING FAN IS RUNNING. IF THE LOW FAN SPEED RELAY FAILS, THE ENGINE COOLING FAN WILL ONLY TURN ON AT 233F (HIGH SPEED FAN MINIMUM TEMPERATURE). ONCE THE ENGINE COOLING FAN TURNS ON AT 233F, THE POWER STEERING FAN WILL TURN ON TO COOL THE POWER STEERING PUMP. THE POWER STEERING FAN WILL BE TOO HOT AT THIS POINT AND WILL OVERHEAT ITSELF AND SEIZE. THE POWER STEERING FAN FAILURE THEN CAUSES THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO OVERHEAT AND FAIL. IF THE POWER STEERING FAN IS NOT REPLACED BEFORE THE POWER STEERING PUMP FAILS, THIS CAUSES THE ENTIRE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FOR THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM TO FAIL AS WELL AND LEAK HYDRAULIC FLUID. IF THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM FAILS, THIS CAN CAUSE THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO ULTIMATELY CATCH ON FIRE DUE TO IT OVERHEATING FROM LOW LEVELS OF HYDRAULIC FLUID.

IT'S AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SO I KNOW THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD BE DOING TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM. THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY AND DRIVEN WITH CARE WHILE IN MY POSSESSION(I'M THE SECOND OWNER. NO SIMILAR ISSUES ON CARFAX REPORT). WHILE THE ENGINE IS COOL AND NOT YET AT ITS OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE THE DRIVE IS FINE AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN NOTICE A PROBLEM; HOWEVER, EVERY RIDE, ONCE WARMED UP THE CAR BEGINS TO SHIFT INCREDIBLY VIOLENTLY AS IT IS OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING TO SWITCH GEARS. THIS OCCURS ALSO WHILE SLOWING DOWN AND THE CAR IS DOWNSHIFTING CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE \"SLUNG\" INTO A CAR FROM BEHIND(THIS HAPPENED IN THE MID SUMMER OF 2011). AFTER DROPPING THIS CAR OFF SEPTEMBER 15TH TO THE LOCAL MINI DEALERSHIP, I DID NOT HEAR FROM THEM FOR ALMOST THREE WEEKS.  IN THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER I WAS CONTACTED AND TOLD IT LOOKS LIKE MY CAR IS VERY EASILY FIXABLE AND SHOULD BE READY SHORTLY.  IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT A SEAL HAD BROKEN ON THE TRANSMISSION LEAKING FLUID ONTO IT CAUSING THIS SHIFTING MALFUNCTION. WHEN THEY FINALLY TOLD ME I CAN PICK UP MY CAR(APPROXIMATELY OCTOBER 18TH) THEY REGRETTED TO INFORM ME THE PROBLEM WAS NOT ABLE TO BE FIXED AND I WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT ELSEWHERE AS THEY DO NOT REBUILD TRANSMISSIONS. NOW IT IS BACK IN MY POSSESSION WHERE I AM FORCED TO COMMUTE IN IT DAILY, DRIVING WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE I DROPPED IT OFF. IT NOW DISPLAYS \"PE\" FOR ITS CURRENT GEAR FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE FILED FOR THIS CAR MATCHING OTHER CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. I AM A VICTIM OF THEIR FAILED POWER STEERING AS WELL.  *TR",

I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT PRIOR TO THE FIRE, THERE WAS NO INDICATION IN THE VEHICLE (WARNING SYSTEM) OR BY THE VEHICLES PERFORMANCE THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE PUMP OR HANDLING. IT FAILED COMPLETELY WITHOUT WARNING! WHILE PARKED AND UNATTENDED!

ON FEBRUARY 12, 2011 I WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON A WINDING ROAD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE POWER STEERING PUMP CATASTROPHICALLY FAILED WITHOUT ANY WARNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGH SPEED TURN. THE UNEXPECTED POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURE MADE THE STEERING COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE CAUSING THE CAR TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL AND NEARLY HIT A TREE (I WAS VERY LUCKY THAT I WASN'T KILLED!). AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THAT UNWARRANTED POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURES ARE QUITE COMMON WITH THE EARLIER MINI COOPER MODELS. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURE VIA A MANDATORY SAFETY RECALL.    AFTER THE INITIAL CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP, THE PUMP WOULD WORK INTERMITTENTLY IN THAT IT WOULD RUN FINE FOR A WHILE AND THEN FAIL AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING A SHORT TIME LATER MAKING THE CAR EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. AT TIMES, THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PUMP WOULD NOT SWITCH OFF AFTER TURNING OFF THE CAR'S IGNITION AND THE CAR'S BATTERY WOULD ULTIMATELY GO FLAT LEAVING US STRANDED.    WE TOOK THE CAR INTO THE MINI DEALERSHIP ON 2/17//2011 AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE CAR AS HAVING A BAD BATTERY (CLAIMING THAT THE BATTERY WAS SO LOW THAT THE CAR WAS ACTUALLY SHUTTING DOWN THE POWER STEERING IN ORDER TO STAY RUNNING). THEY CHARGED US $160 FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS. WE THEN REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH AN OEM BATTER FROM THE DEALERSHIP ($130) AND IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. WE ALSO CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER (MINI USA) DIRECTLY AND THEY WERE UNWILLING TO HELP CLAIMING THAT THE CAR WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY.    ULTIMATELY, ON JULY 26, 2011 (AT 21,385 MILES) WE REPLACED THE FAILED POWER STEERING PUMP (PART # 32-41-6-778-425) AT A COST OF $735.29 (PLUS LABOR). THE MINI DEALERSHIP WANTED WELL OVER $1,000 TO PERFORM THE WORK AND SO WE PURCHASE A REMPLACEMENT PUMP FROM THE MINI DEALERSHIP AND HAD IT INSTALLED OURSELVES.  *TR",

DURING THE ROUTINE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ALONG WITH THE OIL CHANGE, IT WAS REPORTED TO ME THAT MY POWER STEERING FAN HAD FAILED.  FORTUNATELY, AS REPORTED AT THAT POINT, MY POWER STEERING PUMP LOOKED FINE.  I PAID TO HAVE THE POWER STEERING FAN REPLACED AT THAT POINT.  I EXPERIENCED NO ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE'S STEERING UNTIL 11 JUNE 2011 AT APPROXIMATELY 7:30PM WHEN, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PULL INTO A PARKING SPACE IN A PARKING GARAGE, THE POWER STEERING FAILED COMPLETELY.  THE RESULTING LOSS OF STEERING CAPABILITY CAUSED ME TO IMPACT A MOVABLE PARKING SIGN IN THE ADJACENT PARKING SPACE.  HOURS LATER, AFTER COOLING DOWN, THE POWER STEERING CONTINUED TO FUNCTION, BUT HAS BEGUN TO FAIL AT RANDOM INTERVALS.  I AM CURRENTLY AWAITING AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT REPLACED FOR APPROXIMATELY $1500.    2. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAILURE HAVE BEEN HEIGHTENED CONCERN WHILE DRIVING, AND A DYNAMIC COST OF $1500 TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING PUMP.  *TR",

FOR A PART TO WEAR OUT, I AM STUCK WITH  $2,000 REPAIR BILL. THIS CAR IS NOT TOO OLD, IT HAS LESS THAN 50,000 MILES ON IT AND IS ALWAYS GARAGED.

I ALSO HAD TO HAVE REPLACED FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS AT A LABOR AND PARTS COST OF $767.24.  AGAIN, NOT SURE IF THIS IS RELATED TO THE POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURE.  OUR CAR ONLY HAS 46,500 MILES, SO THESE FAILURES SEEM UNUSUAL FOR A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE.  WE ARE ORIGINAL OWNERS.  *TR",

TWO DAYS LATER I WAS PULLING OFF OF THE HIGHWAY AGAIN AND THE STEERING STARTED TO LOCK UP ONCE MORE. I BARELY MADE IT TO A NEARBY PARKING LOT STRONG-ARMING THE CAR WITH EACH TURN. I PULLED INTO A PARKING SPOT AND TURNED OFF THE CAR ONCE AGAIN. AFTER RESTARTING THE CAR THE STEERING STILL WOULD NOT WORK, I EVEN LET IT COOL DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES TO TRY ONCE MORE. STILL UNABLE TO STEER. HAD TO GET MY CAR TOWED AND HAD TO REPLACE POWER STEERING PUMP AND FAN ON CAR. THIS CAR IS LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD AND THE POWER STEERING SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR.",

I OWN A 2005 MINI COOPER S WITH APPROXIMATELY 60,000 MILES ON THE CLOCK.  RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK, IN THE PROCESS OF TURNING A CORNER, THE STEERING ON THE CAR BECAME INSTANTLY HEAVY CAUSING ME TO TEMPORARILY VEER IN TO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE.  FORTUNATELY AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND I WAS ABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL AND CORRECT THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR.  THE SITUATION REMAINED FOR THE DURATION OF MY JOURNEY, BUT I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY NAVIGATE THE CAR HOME.  I RESTARTED THE ENGINE AND THIS APPEARED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, DURING THE NEXT 2 CAR TRIPS SIMILAR FAILURES OCCURRED (FORTUNATELY I WAS PREPARED FOR THE POSSIBILITY AND SO DID NOT END UP IN THE OPPOSING TRAFFIC LANE).    THE MINI DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THIS AS A FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP, A PROBLEM WHICH I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE SUBJECT OF A RECENTLY OPENED NHTSA INVESTIGATION (PE 10038).    PERSONALLY I BELIEVE THIS SITUATION TO BE POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT THE POWER STEERING WAS GOING TO FAIL, AND WHEN IT DID, THE IMPACT WAS IMMEDIATE AND CAUSED ME TO STEER IN TO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC (AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN THE CORNER AT THE REQUIRED ANGLE).  DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE NATURE OF THE FAILURE I WAS NOT ABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM SAFELY IN TIME.    I AM WRITING THIS REPORT TO BE ADDED TO THE EXISTING NHTSA INVESTIGATION (PE 10038). *TR",

WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY, AVERAGE SPEED OF 25 TO 35 MPH, THE POWER ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE POWER STEERING WENT DOWN TO ZERO, TOTALLY UNASSISTED, WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS  WARNING WHATSOEVER, MAKING THE STEERING OF THE VEHICLE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, WHILE GOING AROUND A ROUNDABOUT (TRAFFIC CIRCLE) AT NO MORE THAN 25 MPH. CONSEQUENTIALLY I WAS UNABLE TO STEER FIRST RIGHT AND THE LEFT AROUND THE CIRCLE, MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WHEEL STRIKING THE RIGHT SIDE CURB AT THE POINT THAT I NEEDED TO TURN LEFT, DAMAGING BOTH THE WHEEL AND THE TIRE, AND POSSIBLY THE SUSPENSION (MACPHERSON STRUT).  AND I ASK YOU, WHAT IF I HAD TO STEER TO AVOID A MOTHER PUSHING A BABY STROLLER, OR EVEN AN ERRANT DOG OR CAT AT THE MOMENT THE POWER STEERING ASSISTANCE DECIDED TO QUIT? WHAT IF THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT A HIGHER SPEED WHILE MERGING ON A FREEWAY?  I CONSIDER BMW/MINI TO BE TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DEATHS OR INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGES RELATED TO THEIR NEGLIGENT FAILURE TO ENGINEER A PROPERLY WORKING POWER STEERING PUMP (AN KNOWN PROBLEM AS THE NEWER MODELS HAVE DONE AWAY WITH THE ELECTROHYDRAULIC PUMP IN FAVOR OF A TOTALLY ELECTRICAL ASSISTED STEERING). I ALSO URGE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE FAILURE RATE OF THE POWER STEERING FAN DUE TO ITS ABSURD LOCATION (UNDER THE CAR UNPROTECTED FROM THE DIRT, WATER, STONES,ETC. 5-6 INCHES FROM THE ROAD) AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF A SOLUTION THAT BMW/MINI USED TO RESOLVE THE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO THEM POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURE.

IT HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIMES AND I ASSUMED THAT THE \"DIRT\" WAS WORKING ITS WAY OUT.

TRYING TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN I FOUND MYSELF IN THE OPPOSITE LANE.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE MECHANIC WHO EVENTUALLY GOT THE CAR TO FAIL FOR HIM.  HE TOLD ME TO GO TO A MINI SERVICE CENTER WHO COULD DEAL WITH THE FAULTY ELECTRONICS.  I CALLED MINI OF AMERICA TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE IN MAKING THE CAR \"RIGHT\" BUT I WAS TOLD THAT CARS BREAK, THAT IT IS BEYOND THE 50,000 WARRANTY AND THAT IF THE CAR WAS UNSAFE, I SHOULD HAVE IT FIXED.  THE REP SAID THAT \"MAYBE\" THEY WOULD PAY FOR PART OF THE PROBLEM AFTER IT WAS DIAGNOSED.  I THEN  SPOKE WITH A MECHANIC AT A MINI SERVICE CENTER WHO KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MINIS BEFORE 2007 ----FIRST THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, THEN THE ELECTRONICS COMPLETELY FAIL.

I NEARLY DID NOT MAKE IT HOME ONE EVENING BECAUSE THE JERKING MOTION THE CAR WAS MAKING AND BECAUSE THE ENGINE JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO SHUT OFF. I NEARLY STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY, WHILE IN TRAFFIC.  THE FIRST TRANSMISSION, WHILE UNDER WARRANTY WAS REPLACED IN NOVEMBER 2007 AT 28K MILES. ON 12/16/08,  I HAD AN ACCIDENT WHERE THE TRANSMISSION PAN AMONG OTHER THINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED. IT WAS THE ONLY KNOWN DAMAGE CAUSED TO THE TRANSMISSION. THE AUTO BODY AND PAINT SHOP THAT I CONTRACTED WITH DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FILL THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND THEREFORE THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED THE  LOCAL MINI COOPER DEALERSHIP. THEY PERFORMED THAT PIECE OF IT. NOW, THE DEALER IS TELLING ME I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO STATES THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TRANSMISSION DAMAGE WAS A RESIDUAL OF THE ACCIDENT OR NOT AND THEREFORE, WERE TRYING TO OPEN UP THE OLD INSURANCE CLAIM FROM JANUARY 2009. HOWEVER, MY INSURANCE COMPANY DOES NOT WANT TO PAY FOR THE NEW TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THEY STATE THE REPAIRS FROM THE ACCIDENT $7,888.70, PLUS THE COST OF A NEW TRANSMISSION, AROUND 8K WILL BE MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE CAR. SO, WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THIS NEW TRANSMISSION, THE DEALER, THE AUTO BODY SHOP (WHOM DID NO WORK ON THE TRANSMISSION, SEEMINGLY) OR ME? HOW DO I KNOW, THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER BAD TRANSMISSION? THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL ON A MINI COOPER (NO WAY TO CHECK) TRANSMISSION FLUID AND NO INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON.  *TR",

I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY APPLY THE BRAKES TO KEEP FROM VEERING INTO THE LEFT BARRIER, AND USE ALL MY STRENGTH REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND ADJUST TO SPEED AND STEERING CONTROL TO GET SAFELY OFF OF THE FREEWAY. THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING SITUATION THAT COULD HAVE VERY EASILY ENDED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. ESPECIALLY SINCE I WAS TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED (65 MPH) IN THE FAST LANE OF A BUSY METROPOLITAN CITY WITH CARS ALSO TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED ALL AROUND ME. I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THAT POWER STEERING FAILURE IS A DOCUMENTED ISSUE WITH THE MAKE AND MODEL OF MY CAR, AND THAT IN ADDITION TO MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS, YOUR ORGANIZATION, NHTSA, HAS OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO SUCH CLAIMS (NHTSA ACTION #'S FROM PUBLIC RECORD: PE07022 AND EA07011). MY FRIEND, WHO IS ALSO A MINI OWNER, HAD THIS VERY SAME FAILURE HAPPEN TO HIM, AND RECOMMENDED THAT I FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH YOU (AS HE DID). I UNDERSTAND BMW ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THE 2002/2003 PRODUCTION MODELS, BUT THIS ISSUE CONTINUES TO OCCUR IN SUBSEQUENT PRODUCTION YEARS: MINE (2005) AND THIS PERSON (2004): HTTP://BIT.LY/3HLZ5A. THE POWER STEERING MECHANISM NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. ME, MY PASSENGER, MY DOG, AND ANYONE ELSE DRIVING NEAR ME COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED IF NOT KILLED HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO MANEUVER MY DISABLED VEHICLE TO SAFETY BY BRUTE FORCE. PLEASE HELP ME AND ANY OTHERS WHO MIGHT COME ACROSS THIS PROBLEM AVOID A POSSIBLE CATASTROPHE. IT WILL NOT HELP MUCH TO REPLACE THIS PART WITH ANOTHER FAULTY PART THAT WILL ALSO FAIL IN THE FUTURE.

I WAS ACTUALLY IN MOTION, AND THE CAR JUST STOPPED MOVING!  I HAD TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND RESTART IT.  EML AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON ONCE THE CAR STOPPED.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON FOR A FEW DAYS, THEN WENT OFF, SO I ASSUMED IT WAS A FLUKE AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT (OTHERWISE I ASSUME THE LIGHT WOULD STAY ON).  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED WAS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENARIO AS THE FIRST.  I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT MINI IS CALLING THIS \"LIMP MODE\", BUT I HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL NOTIFICATION FROM MINI, OR ANYTHING INDICATING THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, THE DID KNOW, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE READ OF OTHERS WHO COMPLAINED TO THEM ABOUT THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS!! YET MINI APPARENTLY DID NOT NOTIFY DEALERSHIPS, BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE I CALLED HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WHICH I DESCRIBED, AND WASN'T GOING TO TAKE ME FOR SERVICE UNTIL 2 WEEKS LATER.  I CALLED A SECOND DEALER WHO IMMEDIATELY KNEW THE PROBLEM, AND SAID IT WAS A VOLUNTARY RECALL.  STILL I HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM MINI USA.  I TOOK MY CAR IN AND IT WAS FIXED IN AN HOUR--THEY REPROGRAMMED THE DME. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!  I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM MINI ABOUT A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM!  MAYBE THEY DIDN'T NOTIFY ME BECAUSE I HAD IT TAKEN CARE OF ALREADY, BUT  HAD THIS HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY, RATHER THAN IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, I COULD BE DEAD NOW!  WHY ISN'T MINI NOTIFYING OWNERS WHO PURCHASED THE 2005 AUTOMATICS!!  WHY AREN'T THEY ISSUING A RECALL?  ARE THEY WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BE KILLED?  *JB",
