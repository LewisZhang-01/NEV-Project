        "summary": "During the summer, I used to get some rattling on my new Elantra right after beginning to drive, after a long interval of parking under the sun. But once the car cooled down due to the A/C, the rattling would disappear. I never bothered to find the exact source of rattling because it used to last only a couple of minutes.  Now in the winter, something in the passenger side starts rattling every time I go on a bump! So I took the car to the dealership following a whole week of consistent rattling. They said the noise is coming from somewhere in the dashboard and it is likely due to the misalignment caused by the shrinking of plastic in the cold. They said I could leave the car with them for 2-3 days and they could open up the dashboard and find the exact source of the noise. However, the disclaimer was that opening up the dashboard could actually introduce more rattle after it was assembled back, because the dashboard plastic parts are not precisely machined. Also, if the cause of the rattle was not found to be a manufacturer defect, I would have to pay diagnosis fee as well as the price of any broken parts that needed replacement, along with the labor charge to replace it.  What's the point of warranty then?",

The warning sounds as the AEB activated and I swerved slightly (within my lane). This happened while I still had sufficient safety distance with the car in front of me and before the car in front of me began braking. The second time this happened was 10 minutes later, when there were no cars next to, behind, or in front of me. Same thing happened where AEB suddenly activated under normal driving condition. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request. This sudden braking puts me, my passenger, and car(s) behind me at risk. Potentially this puts cars next to me at risk too. The problem is currently under inspection by the dealer at Cardinale Hyundai in Corona, CA. Dealer so far has notified me the problem was unable to be reproduced and did not find any system or parts out of the ordinary. The vehicle has not been inspected by the police or insurance. This is a brand new 2022 model Elantra purchased on 12/31/2021. There were no prior warnings lamps, messages, or other symptoms prior to the failure. Dash cam video clips of both incidents are available upon request.",

        "summary": "Hired a local tire shop to install winter tires on a second set of wheels, with a second set of TPMS sensors. Later, I discovered the car was not picking up the sensors, but it also failed to illuminate the TPMS sensor alert. When I took it back to the tire shop, they checked the TPMS with their own sensors and said they were working fine, so they didn't know why the car didn't detect them.  I called my Hyundai dealer, and they said that aftermarket TPMS often don't work, and I have to use Hyundai-approved TPMS.   This is fine, but the owner's manual ought to say so. I checked the owner's manual, and it doesn't say that only Hyundai-approved TPMS can be used.  The dealer replied that Hyundai doesn't like people installing aftermarket parts. I replied that installing winter tires is not usually considered an aftermarket modification, and a person shouldn't be inhibited from installing winter tires.  So all I ask is that the owners manual should make this clear. In the section on TPMS, it should say that only Hyundai-approved TPMS sensors should be used, or else it should say that if the driver installs a second set of wheels with winter tires, that this installation should be done by a Hyundai dealer and not by another tire shop.   Of course, the owner could install the winter tires on the factory wheels with the factory TPMS. But this would mean that every season, the all-season and winter tires would be swapped and re-mounted and re-balanced, which is unnecessary. It is standard practice to buy a second set of wheels and TPMS sensors to make seasonal tire changeover easier.  Since installing winter tires on a second set of wheels is a routine practice, and not usually considered an aftermarket modification, therefore, if this car has special TPMS requirements, they should be indicated in the manual.",
