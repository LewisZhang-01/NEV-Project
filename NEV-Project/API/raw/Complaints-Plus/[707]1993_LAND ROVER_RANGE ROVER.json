AFTER NAVIGATING ACROSS MULTIPLE LANES OF MODERATELY HEAVY TRAFFIC WITH NO POWER, I CAME TO A STOP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE.  ONCE THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE CLOSEST LAND ROVER DEALER AND THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED, IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL HAD FAILED.  I'VE SINCE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM AND LAND ROVER HAS EVEN ISSUED TECHNICAL BULLETINS REGARDING THIS REPEATED FAILURE. DESPITE THAT, I HAD NEVER BEEN MADE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BY THE MANUFACTURER DESPITE THAT FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN IN THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT EVERY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE INTERVAL AND ON MANY OTHER OCCASIONS FOR OTHER WORK.  IN FACT, IT WAS IN THEIR SHOP APPROXIMATELY 2,000 MILES PRIOR TO THIS FAILURE FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER WARRANTY RELATED ITEMS AND THIS FAILING MECHANISM WAS NOT DETECTED/FIXED DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS LIKELY CLOSE TO FAILURE AT THAT POINT AND DETECTION OF THE PROBLEM IS POSSIBLE VIA NOTHING MORE THAN A GLANCE AT THE POINT WHERE THE SHAFT AND DIFFERENTIAL HOUSING MEET.  I'M HAPPY NO ONE WAS INJURED BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED THIS FAILURE OCCURRED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT IT OCCURRED 1,000 MILES AFTER THE OEM WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE EXPIRED WHICH NOW MAKES THIS A FINANCIAL CONCERN FOR ME AS WELL.  *NM",

I ENTERED THE BREAKDOWN LANE AND STRUCK A CONCRETE BARRIER AT 40MPH WITH THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE CAR.  WE CAME TO A STOP.  ALL THREE PEOPLE WERE WEARING SAFETY BELTS.  I HAD A MINOR CONCUSSION AND MY DAUGHTER (IN THE RIGHT FRONT PASSANGER SEAT) HAD A SORE NECK AND LOWER BACK PAIN.  MY SON, IN THE BACK SEAT, HAD NO INJURIES.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO ROBINSON SERVICE WHERE IT WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTED THAT THE PITMAN ARM BALL JOINT HAD FALLEN OFF.  MR. ROBINSON TOLD US OF UP TO 6 OTHER 1993, 1994 RANGE ROVERS (THAT HE HAD SEEN SINCE 11/00) THAT HAD SIMILAR FAILURES.  IT WAS ONLY LUCK (LIGHT TRAFFIC, DRY PAYMENT) THAT I OR MY TWO CHILDREN WERE NOT MORE SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED.  OTHER CARS COULD HAVE EASILY BECOME INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.  MR. ROBINSON HAS CHECKED WITH RANGE ROVER AND AS OF TODAY NO RECALLS HAVE BEEN ISSUED ON THIS PROBLEM.  I HOPE THAT RANGE ROVER WILL ISSUE A RECALL IN ORDER TO SAVE OTHERS FROM HARM OR DEATH.
