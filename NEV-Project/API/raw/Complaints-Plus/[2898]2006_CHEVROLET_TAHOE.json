WENT TO FLOOR ALSO! NO TRAFFIC ON THIS SUNDAY SO I WAS VERY LUCKY NOT TO HAVE HAD OR CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. WHEN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PARK THE CAR, I LIFTED THE HOOD AND SAW B FLUID SPLATTER EVERYWHERE. AT THIS POINT, THE EMERGENCY LIGHT INFORMATION ON THE DASH APPEARED: CK BRAKES, AND THE RED CIRCLE APPEARED FOR AB BRAKES! BUT THIS INFORMATION DID NOT APPEAR AS THE B FLUID PRESSURE WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY, WHEN IT MAY HAVE HELPED ME  DECIDE TO PULL OVER. THE CHEVY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS RUST AND OXIDATION UNDERNEATH ON FRAME. BUT THIS CONDITION HAD NOTHING TO DO W/ CAUSING THE B FLUID LEAK. THE FLUID WAS COMING FROM ONE OF THE LINES LEADING FR THE B FLUID RESERVOIR. EITHER A CRACK DEVELOPED OR IT SEPARATED FROM THE PROTRUDING LINE EXTRUDING FROM THE RESERVOIR AND THE BRAKE PRESSURE FORCE SQUEEZED ALL OF THE FLUID OUT THRU THIS SMALL HOLE/CRACK. THIS WAS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AND NOT A FAILURE CAUSED BY SALT, OXIDATION OR WEAR AND TEAR. I THANK THE STARS FOR THE SAFE CONCLUSION OF THIS UNFORGETTABLE EVENT ESP AFTER DRIVING 500 MILES FR MAINE TO DELAWARE.
