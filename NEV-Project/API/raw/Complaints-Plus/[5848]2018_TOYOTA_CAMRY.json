        "summary": "I bought my Camry with 5 miles on it. It\u2019s a 2.5L 8 speed Camry SE. immediately I felt something not right when it would shift between 3/4 gear. It would rock back and forth in a jerking motion. The car has trouble shifting in automatic. When putting it into sport mode it automatically starts at 4th geer. It\u2019s as if the gear shifters are not able to communicate with the engine. It\u2019s stall on me when making a turn and I was almost t-boned June of 2018!  Finally a recall on the fuel pump. I go take it in immediately to have the recall fix. Upon doing so the mechanic informed me that my vacuum pump seems to be bigger than the one that standard for my car.  He said there\u2019s no recall for my vin number but for other cars during that same year there is. So there was nothing I could do but wait for my vin number to be on the recall list.   Then In June 2021 I was backing out of a parking spot and there was a truck in my rear cross traffic that was approaching, my Camry sensed the vehicle with it sonar sensor the alert went off and my braking assistance worked accordingly but the system failed to get the Communication clearly to the engine which in return did not slow down the acceleration of the throttle. So I backed into a truck and my son and myself were in the vehicle. No airbags were dispensed. No injuries but damages to my trunk lid, tail light, brake light and number were damaged.   My car now has airbag malfunction and the steering assistance is working correctly.",

When first backing out of garage or parking spot, at a slow-creeping speed, without use of throttle pedal, attempting to control backward motion with light brake pedal the vehicle's brakes will abruptly active fully halting rearward motion. Further rearward motion requires driver to completely remove foot from brake pedal but any attempt to control rearward speed by feathering brake pedal often causes a repeat of the abrupt brake activation. This cycle repeats the full length of the vehicle  within the garage and the length of the driveway to  the street , additionally 5 to 6 times the vehicle length.  The problem manifests after a lengthy parking, in both forward and reverse directions.  There is often an accompanying discernible mechanical actuator sound coming from the engine compartment  that I associate as a Trigger to expect the abrupt braking.  The obstacle warning may alarm in the garage but acknowledging it with OK does not effect the abrupt braking cycle which continues the length of the driveway, clear of any obstructions.   To be clear, this problem occurs at very slow speeds, about 2 miles per hour.  I have been told by the dealership mechanic that the brakes are designed to operate as conventional hydraulic brakes below 5 mph; this of course doesn't explain the actuator noise emanating from under the hood. Once the vehicle has been on the road, the brake's performance improves with only a slight tendency to  grab when coming to a stop; It's cause to celebrate when the driver can successively make 5 smooth stops. This problem was experienced by 5 separate drivers, each of whom directly expressed dis-satisfaction. Possibly related to the abrupt braking described above is the sudden activation of the brakes and BRAKE warning in what would otherwise be a controlled stop behind a stopped vehicle at a red traffic light.

I discussed this with the Toyota dealer and they said it would be $140.00 an hour to look at it.  I feel that the fuel pipe and fuel cap are both emission items and should be covered.  I also feel this is a possible fire hazard if it starts to leak worse.  I have noticed several other people posting this identical problem on line, so I am not imagining things.  Its easy for you or Toyota to say take it too your dealer.

The contact stated while his father was driving and making a right turn into the driveway at his residence, the brake pedal was depressed however, the vehicle failed to slow down causing the driver to crash into the closed garage door. The vehicle went through the garage door and only stopped after crashing into the inside garage wall. The contact stated that there were skid marks on the floor in the garage. There was no warning light illuminated. The contact stated that the vehicle was damaged. The vehicle was inspected by several friends with automotive knowledge however, a determination was not made as to the cause of the failure. The driver was taken to the Emergency Room for minor contusions to the face and lower back pain. The CT scan showed no major injury or broken bones. There was no police report filed. The vehicle was not taken to be diagnosed or repaired. The vehicle remained inside the garage with the garage door not fully functionable. The contact became aware of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V890000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) after researching online however, the VIN was not included. The contact was also concerned that the Forward Collision Avoidance System failed to operate as designed. The contact stated that there was a prior failure several months ago while his father was making a right turn and attempting to stop the vehicle; however, the vehicle failed to stop and rear-ended the vehicle in front. There were no injuries to either drivers. The vehicle was taken to an authorized dealer and the vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was contacted and informed of the failure and a case was filed. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but offered no assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 33,000.",

As the years pass the situation just gets worse. Today I was about to drive to work and found to my dismay that the car refuses to start. I couldn't even unlock my car with the key fob buttons, I had to use the key itself to unlock the car door to get in. The trunk refused to open even with the button inside the car, so I had to ONCE AGAIN use my key in the key slot to open. No lights came on when I tried to start the car, usually you can hear the engine struggle to start but not this time. After I had it jumpstarted the engine made a truly weird and strange sound, like rattling but much more higher pitched. Engine also sounded very weak too, much higher pitched than usual, almost like it was going to fade out of power. I have not changed the battery for a bit over 4 years. I don't drive much at all, I have 16K miles accumulated in the 4.5 years I've had this vehicle. I really want to love this car and own it until 100K but with problems like this I don't think this car will even last another 5 years. I'm thinking of selling this after a few years and getting a Lexus SUV instead. Apparently this battery issue is common in modern Toyotas, particularly sedans. I have other relatives with new Toyotas and they all had to have battery replacement in less than 2 years of ownership. It's a bummer that  Toyota QC is going down and they are focusing instead on more technology in the cabin. I can only hope and pray that my car won't quit on me in a dark and empty lot one day.",

My other relatives who have newer Toyotas never have an issue. Their wiping action is clean and quiet, while mine leaves huge streaks on the windshield no matter what. I've tried cleaning the wiper blades, slightly oiling them, even putting on a tiny bit of lotion. I avoid even using my windshield wipers now in the summer season and instead just resort to cleaning the entire car to improve visibility. The wiper blades continue to make that squealing sound unless it is POURING HEAVILY outside, AKA when there is a lot of water on the windshield. I try to limit the wiper intervals to mitigate the issue but nothing seems to help. Even tried out more expensive and better windshield wiping fluid/blades but they don't do anything. I'm thinking that the wiping mechanism was installed incorrectly and is placing too much pressure on the blades themselves.

Now I can only achieve 22 mpg and when fueling vehicle completely it now reads 320 miles remaining. This is a LIE and must be admitted by Toyota that it is a grim underestimate. Driver habit has nothing to do with this, I am a very careful (almost slow) driver and the fact that mileage varies this much after a few years of ownership makes no sense. I am dreading the day that this will eventually read 15 mpg on the display. At that point I am definitely selling this car and looking to another brand like Lexus. It is truly ironic how my dad owns a 2015 Tundra that still works like a pro and is able to achieve around 15 mpg consistently even after 7 years of ownership, and my mom's 2019 Sienna is now starting to struggle reaching 17 mpg after just a few years of driving. TOYOTA needs to seriously start concentrating more on vehicle/mechanism reliability instead of trying to install a million safety features (which I find for the most part unnecessary) like every other car manufacturer. What happened to the reliability that was there nearly 10 years ago? It's a shame because I am really trying to love my car and do whatever I can do make sure that it is running smoothly always but my efforts seem to be in vain all the time.

I had to avoid taking the freeway home and instead had to take a 30-minute long trek home along the streets. When I went to inspect my tires I saw several large bulges along the sides of multiple tires, especially the front two tires. I immediately took them to the nearest reputable tire shop and they told me that most likely a nail may have caused the issue, but they did not find a single nail nor any holes in the tire that may have been leaking out air. Repair process was difficult as the first tire shop I went to did not carry the tires my car comes with (apparently they are very hard to come across where I live) but offered to replace all tires with used ones for $70 and strongly recommended I get new ones as soon as possible. The second shop told me that I was lucky to spot the issue quickly and seek repair or else the car tires would have exploded while in motion. Whatever manufacturer stock tires Toyota is using should not even be approved at all. Why not use strong, sturdy tires from a reputable brand instead of settling for cheap ones? Since replacing the tires I have had no issues whatsoever.",

        "summary": "After 4.5 years of owning and operating this vehicle I have noticed some major issues with headlights. Positioning of headlights is very awkward. I avoid driving at night because of this. Even when headlight setting is on the last position I can hardly see a thing in front of me. I have had other drivers flash their lights on me when approaching from the opposite direction because my lights are apparently too bright, but I am not using high beams. I keep my headlights clean and free of debris but problem is still there. I get that blinding another driver/pedestrian is not safe but I have had many instances of driving at night and larger cars (namely SUVs and pickups) swerve into my lane almost causing an accident because they cannot see my car due to the low placement of my car's headlights. When I do turn on my high beams I can see everything that the normal headlight settings refuse to show, from the stop signs that are several hundred feet away, to pedestrians crossing the street several blocks away. On normal setting I'd be lucky to even spot a pedestrian jaywalking across the street before it's too late. I have driven other sedans before and the difference is quite large, how is it that with older cars I can see more without the high beam setting on but with the 2018 Camry I need to bump it up to high beams just to see better at night? Toyota still has not even fixed this even now with their current Camry lineup. At this point having an SUV/pickup serves to be a great advantage.",

        "summary": "After owning this vehicle for almost 4 years, the \"Jerky\" feeling that other individuals have faced is still there, although not as severe now after I figured workarounds. However I do not like having anyone else in my vehicle as they tend to get visibly uncomfortable once they feel that jerk while the vehicle is in motion. It is nearly impossible to have a smooth transition when the vehicle has to slow down and accelerate immediately. There is almost always a significant 2-3 second delay when you have to accelerate quickly into moving traffic. If I let my foot off the gas while in motion I can feel the gears thud while in motion to accommodate for the loss in speed. Dealerships I've went to have reset the 'software' multiple times and say that the jolts are something I have to get used to and that the car 'learns' from your driving habits. A Toyota dealership rep also told me that Lexus's have this problem too. Clearly this is something that Toyota has not paid attention to since they overhauled and completely redesigned their 2018 lineup. A vehicle is NOT a pet and should not have to be trained. I am unsatisfied with how Toyota does not seem to be addressing this common transmission issue and offering repair services.  The only workarounds I have experimented with myself and found some degree of success is   1. turning off eco mode 2. NOT using the cheapest gas (if located in SoCal use #89 when financially able. COSTCO gas seems to deliver good results).  3. fully warming up the car before operating for the first time 4. accelerating gradually (DO NOT STEP ON GAS PEDAL HARD) 5. avoid braking hard (do not tailgate others and allow proper distance between yourself and other drivers)  These steps only lessen the severity of the jolts felt but does not totally eliminate them. I don't feel 100% safe while driving this vehicle and am planning on selling it as soon as payments are done.",

In the almost 4 years since I've owned this car I have had multiple scratches and scrapes on the underside of the front bumper; it's ridiculous. A very small dip in the road most of the time leads to scratches which I can feel while driving. The only way to not feel this scraping sound is to approach the dip extremely slow at around 5 mph, which is a safety concern because I don't want anyone ramming into my car from behind. Certain roads I need to pass when I get home have truly terrible construction to the point where I feel like I'm driving my car across a rocky road. I've driven other similar sedans and I don't even feel scraping along the bottom side of the front bumper when approaching a steep dip. I just can't believe how someone in the designs team at Toyota could possibly OK such a poor design. No scratches are visible on my car until you reach the front bumper which is a total disaster. In fact, much of the paint has been scraped off clean and you can see the graphite colored body color.",

IT TENDS TO BE WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME - AFTER WORK, WHEN IT HAD BEEN SITTING FOR >8 HOURS, WHEN I RETURNED HOME FROM A WEEK VACATION, AND OTHER TIMES WHEN IT HAD BEEN SITTING OVERNIGHT IN MY DRIVEWAY. I WOULD SMELL A POWERFUL ODOR OF GASOLINE WHEN I APPROACHED THE CAR, WHICH IS WHAT WOULD MAKE ME CHECK THE GAS TANK AREA. SEVERAL TIMES, I WITNESSED THE GASOLINE RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF MY CAR. IN ALL CASES THERE WERE GASOLINE STAINS ON THE PAVEMENT UNDER THE GAS TANK. AND THE SIDE OF MY WHITE CAR HAS A PERMANENT YELLOW STREAK DOWN THE SIDE FROM THE LEAKING GAS. I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES TO HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE IT, BUT THEY SAID THERE IS NO WAY IT COULD BE HAPPENING WITHOUT THE WARNING LIGHT GOING ON ON THE DASHBOARD BECAUSE IT IS A CLOSED SYSTEM. THEY SAID I MUST BE OVERFILLING MY GAS TANK OR NOT TIGHTENING THE GAS CAP ENOUGH. I HAVE PICTURES OF THE GAS LEAKING OUT AFTER THE CAR SAT OVERNIGHT, AND I HAD ALREADY DRIVEN 120 MILES SINCE MY LAST FILL UP. EVEN AFTER I SHOWED THE PICTURES TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, HE STILL SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT WAS HAPPENING. FINALLY, I CALLED TOYOTA'S CORPORATE LINE AND REPORTED IT.

AFTER 1 WEEK OF PURCHASE I AM HAVING SOME PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY WITH THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION. ENGINE BECAUSE I AM FEELING A LOSE OF POWER WHEN ACCELERATING AND NOT SMOOTH WHEN DRIVING ALSO IT IS NOISY WHEN YOU START THE CAR. ALSO WHEN AT A FULL STOP I CAN FEEL THE VEHICLE SHAKE AND WHEN YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL AND DRIVE AT 20 MPH YOU CAN FEEL THE PEDAL SHAKE. TRANSMISSION BECAUSE I CAN FEEL THE TRANSMISSION JERKING AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON DRIVE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ON DRIVE IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE ON NEUTRAL DRIVING BECAUSE OF HOW ROUGH IT IS WHEN YOU ACCELERATE. I ALSO WENT TO THE DEALER FOR THIS MATTER BUT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. PLEASE HELP ME BECAUSE I AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH TOYOTA BECAUSE MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TOYOTAS AND THEY NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE. THE CAR IS GOOD BUT THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE HAS DISAPPOINTED ME BECAUSE TOYOTAS HAVE A GREAT REPUTATION AND NOW THEY ARE JUST GIVING THAT ALL UP JUST TO SAVE MONEY ON FIXING THIS ISSUE THAT'S WHAT I FEEL THAT THEY ARE DOING. THATS WHY I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH TOYOTA AND THERE ENGINEERING BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THEY PUT IN TOO MUCH FOR THE REDESIGNED PART BUT NOT THE PERFORMANCE PART.",

        "summary": "THE 2018 TOYOTA CAMRY SE HAS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH DELAYED ACCELERATION THAT IMPACTS THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE. THE CAR'S 8-SPEED TRANSMISSION HAS TROUBLE SELECTING THE PROPER GEAR WHEN THE DRIVER NEEDS TO ACCELERATE AFTER DECELERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IMAGINE DRIVING STEADY AT 40MPH BEFORE DECELERATING TO AN INTERSECTION FOR A TURN, MAKING THE TURN, THEN PRESSING THE GAS AGAIN TO ACCELERATE. WHEN PRESSING THE GAS AGAIN TO ACCELERATE IN THIS SCENARIO, THE CAR STRUGGLES TO SELECT THE PROPER GEAR AFTER THE DOWNSHIFT FROM 40 MPH CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO PAUSE (NO ACCELERATION) FOR 3 SECONDS BEFORE VERY ROUGHLY CYCLING THROUGH TWO OR THREE GEARS BEFORE THE PROPER GEAR IS SELECTED. BOTH MY WIFE AND I EXPERIENCE THIS WHILE DRIVING THE CAR AND OFTEN FEEL VULNERABLE AND STUCK AS TRAFFIC MUST BRAKE UNEXPECTEDLY BECAUSE THE CAMRY WILL NOT SIMPLY SELECT A GEAR AND MOVE WHEN THE GAS IS PRESSED. ALSO, WHEN THE CAMRY FINALLY DOES MOVE, THERE IS NO PREDICTING HOW MUCH ACCELERATION THE DRIVER WILL EXPERIENCE. THIS CAUSES SAFETY CONCERN FOR BOTH GETTING REAR-ENDED WHILE THE CAMRY WON'T ACCELERATE, AND ALSO SAFETY CONCERN FOR REAR-ENDING SOMEONE ELSE WHEN THE CAMRY UNPREDICTABLY ACCELERATES. THE TOYOTA DEALER HAS DONE NOTHING TO FIX THIS AND STATES IT IS WORKING AS DESIGNED BECAUSE NO ERROR CODES ARE THROWN. THE TOYOTA DEALER DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 8-SPEED TRANSMISSIONS ARE NEW TO TOYOTA AND THEY HAVE HAD MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE 8-SPEED TRANSMISSION IN THE TOYOTA SIENNA.",
