WHICH IT WILL BE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP. I ALSO TOLD THEM THAT OUR CAR WAS SPILLING GAS DUE TO AN ORIGINAL FAULTY UNIT. THEY STATED THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THAT HOWEVER, IT SOMEHOW DOESN'T SHOW ON MY VIN. SEVERAL TIMES WE RAN OUT OF GAS AND OUR KIDS GOT GASOLINE ON THEIR CLOTHES. WE CALLED 4 DEALERSHIPS AND ALL OF THEM STATE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHEN I OPEN THE HOOD I SEE GMC BRAND ALL OVER THE CAR. I BELIEVE GMC IS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND NOT ACCOMMODATING ME. I TOLD THEM I CANNOT DRIVE 300 MILES, I HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE TAKE IT BECAUSE I HAD A STROKE. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE GMC BUT THEY ARE NOT. IF THEY ARE USING THAT AS AN EXCUSE THEN THIS RECALL COMMITTEE SHOULD INVESTIGATE INTO THIS AND SANCTION THEM. AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE OF SAFETY RECALL IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GET IT DONE, I CANNOT SAFELY DRIVE WITH MY KIDS. 2 OF MY KIDS ARE SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS. AT THIS POINT, I WOULD LIKE GMC TO REIMBURSE ME THE FULL CURRENT VALUE OF THE VEHICLE FOR THEIR FAILURE TO DO THE NEEDED RECALL REPAIRS.

GMC CONSTANTLY MAKES ME FEEL THAT EVEN THOUGH70% OF THE VEHICLE IS GMC I DON'T HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS GMC CUSTOMERS. CURRENTLY, THE BLUE BOOK VALUE IS $6500. I'M STOPPING PAYING REGISTRATION IN HOPES TO GET THIS VEHICLE EITHER TRADED IN FOR ANOTHER ONE BY GMC OR REFUNDED.

I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO MY SAAB DEALER, AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO AS IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. DURING THE REST OF THE SUMMER I DROVE THAT CAR I HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEMS. (IT IS MY PARENTS CAR THAT I DROVE WHEN I WAS HOME FOR THE SUMMER). I LATER FOUND OUT THAT MY PARENTS ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM INTERMITTENTLY SO I BEGAN SEARCHING ONLINE AND FOUND OTHERS THAT HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM AND REFERENCED A REPORT PE08005 WHICH SEEMED TO DESCRIBE MY PROBLEM. I BROUGHT THIS REPORT TO THE SAAB DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NEVER SEEN IT AND COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  *TR",

THE COOLANT EXPANSION TANK WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.     IN OCTOBER 2008, WE AGAIN EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH THE COOLANT EXPANSION TANK LEAKING AND AGAIN HAD TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT A COST OF $389.32 PLUS THE COST OF A RENTAL CAR, AS THE PARTS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.    MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED BY SAAB REGARDING THIS RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THE TURBO V-6 ENGINE, AS THE TURBOCHARGER IS LOCATED TOO CLOSE TO THE EXPANSION TANK.    I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO HAVE TO REPLACE THE COOLANT EXPANSION TANK TWICE WITHIN A 14 MONTH PERIOD ON A CAR THAT IS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD.  I FILED A CLAIM WITH SAAB CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY RESPONDED THAT SINCE IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE YEAR SINCE THE PARTS HAD BEEN REPLACED, AND THE CAR WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE BUMPER-TO-BUMPER WARRANTY, THEY WOULD NOT TAKE ANY ACTION.    ALSO, THE ORIGINAL REPAIRS WERE MADE AT A DEALERSHIP THAT HAS SINCE CLOSED AND CONSOLIDATED AT A SECOND DEALERSHIP THAT IS SOME DISTANCE AWAY (IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA).  THE DEALERSHIP IN SAN FRANCISCO SAYS THAT THE REPAIRS IN SAAB'S SYSTEM INDICATE THAT ONLY THE COOLANT EXPANSION TANK CAP WAS REPLACED THE FIRST TIME, WHICH DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE INVOICE THAT I HAVE.      IN SUMMARY, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A FAULTY DESIGN INVOLVED, AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIRS, NOT US.  I AM CONCERNED REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF THE CAR, AND SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE COOLANT SYSTEM, WE WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE. *TR",
