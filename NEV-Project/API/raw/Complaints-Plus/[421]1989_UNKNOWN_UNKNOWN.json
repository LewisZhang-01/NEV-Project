I WROTE AND CALLED THE ROVER  GROUP SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND WAS CONTINUALLY PUT OFF.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE STATE OF MINNESOTA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILE NO: CMR/2000/222041/C.  THEY CONTACTED MR. SCOTT DUNCAN OF LAND ROVER NORTH AMERICA, 4371 PARLIMENT PLACE, PO BOX 1503 LANHAM MD 20706. PHONE 301 731-9054. MR. DUNCAN IS THE MANAGER OF OWNER RELATIONS THAT SENT ME A LETTER IN SEPT. 1998 STATING THAT THE LIST OF OWNERS WAS BEING COMPILED. IN A LETTER DATED NOV. 8, 2000 TO THE MN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MR. DUNCAN SAYS THAT LAND ROVER IS NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SEAT BELT RECALL DUE TO A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. HE STATES THAT MG WAS SOLD TO THE PHOENIX GROUP. HE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE PHOENIX GROUP. I HAVE CALLED LAND ROVER FOR CONTACT INFORMATION WHICH THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SEAT BELT RECALL AND IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET NEW SEATBELTS FOR MY CAR. IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH LAND ROVER, I WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WAS INCLUDED AND THAT THEY WOULD SEND NEW BELTS WHEN THEY BECAME AVAILABLE.  *AK",
