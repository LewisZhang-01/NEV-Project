        "summary": "My Toyota FJ Cruiser 2008 \"FUEL PUMP\" failed to indicate the amount of gasoline I had in the tank, the car completely stop working on the freeway while I  was driving approximately at  70 MPH right in the fast lane, the car/motor just ugly shook and suddenly  it stall/shut down... luckily the cars behind me were able to maneuver their cars and avoided a possible crash. I tried to start the car again and gave me some forward jumps until i got it off of the road. the gas panel indicator was still reading 1/2 filled tank but not gas inside tank...I called freeway service  patrol (511) and they Offered me a gallon of gas, as i run out (they saved my day).  i thought this was just one hit wonder problem but not the car has been getting me in trouble ever since now my wife drives it too, she or me assume there is still gas in the car and out of the blue i wind out carrying gas in a red gallon... i asked mechanics if they can replace but they said no easy -  access to replace the pump is not well designed to extract the fuel pump and the floor mats on the car and the rear seat must be removed and some how the car will have some cosmetic damage... best is to lower the full gas tank from underneath but there is also a problem as the wire connector length are extremely short and they must be cut out and add extensions after replacing pump and may affect sensor lights... and repair for that is quite expensive. The car pump goes up when full tank but as gas is used needle stops at 1/2 mark and there is no way to tell if i have gas- I had experienced 8 time stalls, luckily  no accidents -    I found this online and called Toyota but they are unaware of this recall:   \"if stall  pump fails, the engine can stall while driving, increasing the risk of a crash. Toyota will notify owners, and dealers will replace the fuel pump, free of charge. The recall began May 4, 2020. Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371\" is it true?",

Which Toyota have a recall on those two models but they've yet to recognize the Toyota FJ Cruiser for the same issue.   If this issue isn't resolved, it can result in weak points in the chassis making those area fail and cause an accident underload.  I have had my shop look at it and said they can only treat the affected areas so much but the issue will keep coming back over time as rust does not go away unless its cut out.

THE COMBINATIONS OF GOOD AND BAD CALIPERS CAN CAUSE THE CAR TO ZIG ZAG LEFT OR RIGHT UNPREDICTABLY, PULLING LEFT OR RIGHT, AND IF THE DRIVER IS NOT READY FOR IT, CAN CAUSE A BIG PROBLEM CONTROLLING THE CAR. HARD TO EXPLAIN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE VARIOUS BRAKING RESPONSES YOU CAN GET WITH THIS PROBLEM, BUT CHECK THE COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH ISSUES WITH FJ CRUISERS, FOUR RUNNERS ETC.

I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH THE CAR AND TOYOTA AUTHORIZED AND THE DEALER DID REPLACE THREE COMPLETE CALIPERS NO CHARGE UNDER MY EXTENDED TOYOTA WARRANTY. HOWEVER SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS BROUGHT THE REGIONAL SERVICE REP TO A MEETING AT MY REQUEST WHERE WE WENT TO AN EMPTY PARKING LOT AND CONDUCTED \"PANIC\" STOPS SEVERAL TIMES AT 35 MPH AND ONE AT 40 MPH WITH NOT DUPLICATION OF MY COMPLAINTS. I AM SUSPICIOUS THAT THE PANIC STOPPING IS A WAY TO GET WHAT WOULD BE CALLED A \"PROPORTIONING CONTROL VALVE\" TO UN-STICK. THIS VALVE AS I CALL IT IS A DEVICE THAT BALANCES BRAKE FLUID PRESSURE TO ALL FOUR CALIPERS IN AN EQUAL CRISS-CROSS PRESSURE SO ALL CALIPERS ARE GETTING THE SAME PRESSURE UNLIKE OLD FASSIONED SINGLE OR DOUBLE SYSTEMS FROM BACK IN THE DAY. I CAN'T VERIFY THIS IS A \"SECRET\" SERVICE FIX FOR UNBALANCED BRAKING, BUT NOW SOME MONTHS AFTER MY CALIPER REPLACEMENTS, THE CALIPERS ARE BEGINNING TO EXHIBIT THE SAME PROBLEM AND I'M OUT OF WARRANTY.

AFTER RECEIVING A RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL ON MONDAY, 5/20, I CHECKED THE TOYOTA WEBSITE AND FOUND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON THE LOGGED-IN OWNER SITE:     THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR AUTHORIZED TOYOTA DEALER AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT TO PERFORM AN INSPECTION AND INSTALL REINFORCEMENT BRACKETS ON BOTH DOORS ACCESS AT NO CHARGE TO YOU. BASED UPON THE INSPECTION, IN LIMITED CASES, THE SEAT BELT RETRACTOR(S) AND/OR ACCESS DOOR(S) MAY BE REPLACED.    I IMMEDIATELY MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THAT SAME AFTERNOON. I HAD TO ARGUE WITH THE DEALER THAT THE BRACKETS WERE REQUIRED (THEY WANTED ONLY TO PERFORM THE INSPECTION AND STOP THERE IF NO CRACKS WERE PRESENT). AFTER FINALLY AGREEING THAT YES, THE BRACKETS NEEDED TO BE INSTALLED (THEY HAD 'MISREAD' THE PROCESS FLOW CHART! THEY DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE HAD ANY TRAINING ON WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS), THEY SAID THEY HAD NONE IN STOCK AND WOULD ORDER THEM TODAY. THIS MORNING THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THAT TOYOTA HAS \"BLOCKED ORDERING OF THOSE PARTS\" - AND SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THE SOLUTION DOESN'T WORK.    CURRENTLY WE ARE DRIVING VEHICLES THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMAL GOVERNMENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS - BOTH THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER ARE IN DANGER OF HAVING SEAT BELTS MALFUNCTION DURING AN ACCIDENT. THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING SOME TYPE OF RELIEF (E.G., LOANER CARS UNTIL THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED).    THANK YOU.  *TR",
