IT DOES IT MORE SO WHEN ITS HOT AND HUMID OUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE GASOLINE EXPANDING IN THE HEAT WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT BUT IT DID NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THE TANK WAS FULL OR HALF FULL. IT'S A BIG HAZARD BECAUSE THE BIKE IS IN A GARAGE AND IF IT GETS SLIGHTLY HUMID IN THERE, IT BEGINS TO LEAK AND CAUSES A LOT OF VAPORS AND FUMES MAKING IT EXTREMELY HARD TO BREATH AND I'M SURE IF SOMETHING CREATED A SPARK THERE WOULD BE AN EXPLOSION. I'M FORCED TO OPEN THE GARAGE DOOR EVERYDAY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND CLOSE IT AS SOON AS THE SUN GOES DOWN. I BROUGHT IT TO A DUCATI DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT WOULD DO THAT AND THAT'S THE FIRST THEY HEARD OF IT.  *TR",
