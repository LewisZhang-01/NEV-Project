The contact then called Brad Deery Motors (112 N. 2nd St, Maquoketa, IA 52060) and was informed to take the vehicle in to be diagnosed. The contact was then informed that only one of the rotors needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired however, the failure persisted. The contact also stated that upon attempting to park the vehicle, the shift to park warning message would illuminate on the instrument panel. The contact had to repeatedly shift the vehicle in and out of the park before the vehicle would recognize the shifter in the park position. The manufacturer had been notified of the failures but offered no assistance. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 46,000.",

UNFORTUNATELY, WE TOOK IT TO THE NEAREST DELEARSHIP TO GET IT FIXED AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO THE SNOW, BUT AFTER THE SNOW EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR A VEHICLE AND HAVE IT PARKED DURING THE WINTER, THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO US.  BECAUSE NOR THE DEALERSHIP OR GMC HAS DONE ANYTHING TO HELP. THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED SINCE DECEMBER 2018, THE VEHICLE HAS 34500 MILES ON IT AND IS RELATIVELY NEW NOW, BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES. IT IS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THEY ACCEPT THESE VEHICLES HAVE ISSUES AND CORRECT THEM PRIOR TO PROMOTING AND SELLING TO CUSTOMERS. SINCE THEY DID NOT CORRECT THESE ISSUES PRIOR TO SOME INDIVIDUALS TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE, THEY SHOULD WORK ON A SOLUTION VIA A RE-CALL TO AVOID ANY INJURIES TO FAMILIES OF THEIR VEHICLE'S OWNERS.",
