There is a lot of traffic on this highway and he was trying to find a spot to pull off.  His airbag on the drivers side deployed but he was able to push it down and see a dirt area to pull off.  There were no warning lights or issues with the vehicle that he was aware of.  The police and fire were called to the scene, by bystanders.  Obviously my son and passenger were very shaken up by this.  My son reported this to Geico, his insurance that same day and has been working with the claims adjuster on this.  We wanted to report this because this could have so easily been a different outcome.  The truck and all belongings in it burned very quickly.  It was towed to Mustang Towing in Horseshoe Bend, ID.

THE WAIT IN THIS SLOW MOVING LINE MAY HAVE BEEN A HALF HOUR.  IN THIS HALF HOUR, I WOULD LET OFF THE BRAKE TO ROLL FORWARD AND REAPPLY THE BRAKE.

THE VEHICLE WAS PUT IN PARK.  AFTER ISSUES WERE RESOLVED, I PUT THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE AND TURNED AROUND FOR PARKING.  IT WAS HERE THAT I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL TO GET BACK IN LINE, BUT WHEN I HIT THE BRAKE AS I ENTERED MY SPOT, THE BRAKE REFUSED TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  I CONTINUED TO PRESS THE BRAKE, BRACING MY BACK AGAINST THE SEAT BACK REST, AND COULD FEEL US SLOWING, BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE I WAS PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL FOR.  NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED AND THE SPEED I WAS SLOWING DOWN FROM COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 15 MPH.  AS WE ENTERED THE PARKING LOT, THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  I COULD ONLY SLOW THE VEHICLE BY BRACING AGAINST THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I COULD NOT GET THE VEHICLE TO SUDDEN STOP FROM A ROLLING SPEED.  I REVERSED INTO MY PARKING SPOT, PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK, APPLIED THE PARKING BRAKE, AND SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  WHEN I RETURNED FROM THE BALL GAME, I STARTED THE VEHICLE BACK UP, TOOK OFF THE PARKING BRAKE, PUT IT IN DRIVE AND TESTED THE BRAKES IN THE PARKING LOT.  THE BRAKES FUNCTIONED LIKE NORMAL.  DEPRESSING THE BRAKES HARD WOULD MAKE THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY STOP.  I HAVE NOT HAD THIS ISSUE SINCE.

READING ONLINE THE ISSUE APPEARS COMMON IN GM TRUCKS FROM 2014 UP AND THE CAUSE WAS OFTEN A FAILING VACUUM PUMP. I LOCATED A COPY OF A SERVICE BULLETIN PUBLISHED INTERNALLY BY GM DISCUSSING THE ISSUE AND PRESCRIBING A REPAIR PROCEDURE. THE BULLETIN NOTED THAT IF ENGINE OIL ESCAPED PAST THE SEAL(S) OF THE FAILING VACUUM PUMP REPLACEMENT OF THE BRAKE BOOSTER, MASTER CYLINDER, AND VACUUM LINE MAY BE REQUIRED IN ADDITION TO THE PUMP. GIVEN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS AS A COMMON ISSUE, FEAR OF LOSING BRAKES AGAIN, AND FEARING THAT WAITING MAY NECESSITATE OTHER BRAKING COMPONENTS UNDER THE HOOD NEEDING REPLACEMENT IF THE OIL SEEPED THROUGH THE PUMP, I PROMPTLY REPLACED THE VACUUM PUMP. FOLLOWING THE REPAIR PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED IN THE GM BULLETIN THERE WAS NO ENGINE OIL NOTED IN THE VACUUM LINE SO NO FURTHER PARTS WERE REPLACED OTHER THAN THE PUMP AND GASKET.

IT HAS HAPPENED WHEN PARKING, MOVING TRAILERS, AN MANEUVERING AT LOW VEHICLE SPEEDS. THE BRAKE PEDAL SUDDENLY BECOMES STIFF WHEN DEPRESSING AND HAS LIMITED OR NO BRAKING ACTION UNLESS APPLYING EXTREME AMOUNTS OF PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. I HAVE DRIVEN VEHICLES WITHOUT POWER BRAKES AND THIS IS NOT THE SAME. IT IS AS IF THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS WORKING AGAINST THE INPUT OF THE PEDAL IN ADDITION TO THE LOSS OF POWER BRAKE ACTION. THE MOST CONCERNING EVENT WAS EXPERIENCED WHILE BACKING A BOAT TRAILER INTO THE WATER WITH TWO CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT, BUCKLED IN CHILD RESTRAINING CAR SEATS AND PUSHING WITH BOTH FEET USING ALL MY STRENGTH TO BARELY STOP THE TRUCK AND TRAILER FROM ROLLING ALL THE WAY INTO THE WATER.

GM BECAME AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND SENT NEW (PROPERLY PRODUCED) CONDENSERS TO THEIR PRODUCTION LINES FIRST, LEAVING HUNDREDS OF GMC OWNERS WITHOUT A/C OVER THE SUMMER. THEY PUT OUT A \"SPECIAL RECALL\" ON A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF VINS SAYING IT \"MAY\" HAPPEN IN OTHER VINS. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE (TO INCLUDE MYSELF) TO WHERE GM IS ACKNOWLEDGING THIS ISSUE BUT REFUSING TO COVER THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THEIR FAULTY PART FOR HUNDREDS OF OWNERS HAVING THIS ISSUE. THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THIS FAULTY PART FOR MY VEHICLE WAS $1,338.61 AT THE GMC DEALERSHIP. I'VE CALLED GMC AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS: \"IT MAY HAPPEN WITH MY VIN BUT THEY WILL NOT COVER THE REPLACEMENT\" EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS IN FACT THE ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF OTHER OWNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

PROBLEM STARTED AS AN RARE ISSUE THAT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF AND PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE OVER A WEEK'S TIME.  ISSUE OCCURRED WHEN IN TRAFFIC REQUIRING FREQUENT STOP-N-GO BRAKING.   BRAKE PEDAL WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR AND STOPPING DISTANCES DRAMATICALLY INCREASED.  HAD NO WAY TO MANUALLY APPLY THE BRAKES TO GET THEM FULLY ENGAGED.  ULTIMATELY FORCED TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL AND APPLY PARKING BRAKE TO STOP.  SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND GM BULLETIN #PIT5361B REFERRING TO OTHER CUSTOMER PROBLEMS WITH WEAK VACUUM AT BRAKE BOOSTER.  THAT PROBLEM WAS CONFIRMED AND DIAGNOSED BY MY AUTOMOTIVE PROFESSIONAL.  ENDED UP HAVING TO REPLACE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER, VACUUM BOOSTER, VACUUM PUMP, VACUUM TUBE/PIPE AND 2 SERPENTINE BELTS FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF $1626.00 IN REPAIR WORK (SIMILAR AMOUNT TO THE OTHERS I FOUND WHO EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE).  TALKED TO MY GMC DEALER WHO CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS A RECOGNIZED ISSUE THAT HASN'T YET RISEN TO THE LEVEL OF A \"SAFETY RECALL\".  HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD \"STAY TUNED\" BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF A RECALL ON THE POWER BRAKE SYSTEM WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.",

THE MECHANICAL SHUTTER DESIGN PRODUCES A VERY SHARP BEAM CUTOFF AT ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE HOOD, MAKING IT SEEM LIKE YOU ARE SITTING IN A DARKENED AREA ABOVE A BOWL OF LIGHT. THE PROJECTOR HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE LITTLE, IF ANY, ILLUMINATION OF OBJECTS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I USE THE FOG/DRIVING LIGHTS CONTINUALLY ON THE TRUCK OR I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING IT WITH LOW BEAMS IN UNLIT AREAS.

THE TRUCK PICTURE WAS TAKEN APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES LATER THAN THE CAR PICTURE (BOTH WERE APPROXIMATELY 6:45 A.M.).  NOTE THERE IS A SLIGHT PERSPECTIVE SHIFT DUE TO THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE IN THE VEHICLES AND THE DRIVING/FOG LIGHTS WERE NOT ON ON EITHER VEHICLE WHEN THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN.  NOTE THE 25-YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY SEALED BEAM HEADLIGHTS SHOW THE FENCE POSTS AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WHERE THE GMC'S HEADLIGHTS SHOW A DARK VOID.  IT HONESTLY FEELS LIKE YOU ARE DRIVING THROUGH A TUNNEL OF LIGHT IN THE TRUCK. YOU HAVE NO HOPE OF SEEING ANY OBJECTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.    THERE IS A TSB ON THIS ISSUE THAT RECOMMENDS REPLACING THE BULBS AND REPROGRAMMING THE BCM.  MY TRUCK HAS NOT HAD THIS PERFORMED BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT HAVE THE BULBS IN STOCK WHEN I ASKED ABOUT IT.

THE REPAIR IS EXTREMELY POOR AND REQUIRES THE DEALERSHIP TO MUTILATE AN INTERIOR PIECE OF THE VEHICLE BY CUTTING IT WITH A RAZOR BLADE. I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS SAFETY RECALL COMPLETED IF I KNEW AHEAD OF TIME HOW POORLY GM WOULD HAVE MADE THE REPAIRS. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, THIS EXPERIENCE IS SHARED BY EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD THIS RECALL PERFORMED, AND MANY PEOPLE ARE OPTING OUT DUE TO THE POOR HANDLING BY GM.    ALSO, TO MAKE THINGS WORSE ... GM WILL PROPERLY REPAIR THEIR OWN VEHICLES IF THEY ARE UNSOLD, OR ON THE DEALER LOT. INSTEAD OF HACKING UP THE INTERIOR, THEY REPLACE THE TRIM PIECE WITH A BRAND NEW PART. THIS IS DONE SO THAT THEIR NEW UNSOLD VEHICLES DON'T HAVE THE HEINOUSLY CUT UP INTERIOR PIECE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY TURN OFF A BUYER.     I BELIEVE GM'S SOLUTION FOR NEW AND CURRENTLY OWNED TRUCKS SHOULD BE THE SAME. CURRENT OWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS EXTREMELY POOR SOLUTION FROM GM. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS POOR SOLUTION BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT THEM TO HACK UP YOUR TRUCK, THEY REQUIRE YOU TO DECLINE THE RECALL.

IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE SIDES OF THE ROAD, OR VERY FAR DOWN THE ROAD, ON ROADS WHERE THERE ARE NO STREETLIGHTS.  IT IS EVEN WORSE ON A RAINY, DARK ROAD.  GM INSTITUTED A TSB (#PIT5374, ATTACHED) IN FEBRUARY 2015 WHICH INVOLVES REPROGRAMMING THE BODY CONTROL MODULE (BCM) TO INCREASE THE VOLTAGE TO THE HEADLIGHT BULBS AND SUBSTITUTING VOSLA HIR 55 WATT BULBS FOR THE ORIGINAL STOCK 55 WATT BULBS.  THE RESULTS ARE A MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE NEW 2016 MODELS HAVE THE SAME HEADLIGHT DESIGN BUT HAVE BEEN UPGRADED TO A HID BULB THAT CANNOT JUST BE PLUGGED INTO THE 2014/15 HEADLIGHTS.  THE IMPROVED BULB AND WIRING IS EVIDENCE THE TSB DID NOT REALLY IMPROVE THE LIGHTING VERY MUCH.  (THE INTERNET IS FULL OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE; RECOMMEND YOU GOOGLE \"GMC SIERRA HEADLIGHTS\" AND SEE WHAT YOU GET!).   I LIVE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND WOULD BE GLAD TO COME DOWN TO THE NHTSA BUILDING ON A DARK, RAINY NIGHT AND GIVE YOU A RIDE -- THE PROBLEM ISN'T SO BAD IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STREETLIGHTS, BUT IT IS TERRIBLE OUT IN THE COUNTRY.

I VISITED THE DEALER WHO EXECUTED A TSB THAT INCREASED HEADLIGHT VOLTAGE AND REPLACED THE BULBS.  IT MADE A NEGLIGIBLE IMPROVEMENT AND LEFT THE VEHICLE STILL UNSAFE AT NIGHT.  I FREQUENTLY TRAVEL ON RURAL ROADS WITH NO STREET LIGHTS.  I HAVE ALMOST HIT WILDLIFE TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT DUE TO THE POOR VISIBILITY CAUSED BY THESE DANGEROUS HEADLIGHTS.  TRAVEL OVER 30 MPH ON DARK COUNTRY ROADS WITH A LEGAL SPEED LIMIT OF 50 IS ILL ADVISED DUE TO THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEADLIGHTS.",

THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM HAS NO NIGHT SCHEME, MEANING IT DOESN'T SHIFT TO A MOSTLY BLACK BACKGROUND AT NIGHT MAKES THIS PROBLEM EVEN WORSE. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOWER THE BRIGHTNESS USING A DASH-MOUNTED DIMMER SWITCH, THE DIMMER MUST BE LOWERED TO MINIMUM IN ORDER TO GET THE RADIO SCREEN TO BE A COMFORTABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVEL FOR NIGHT DRIVING. AT THIS POINT, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER LIGHTS ARE SO DIM AS TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SEE AND AS A RESULT REQUIRE MUCH MORE TIME AND EFFORT TO READ SPEED INFORMATION.    THE ONLY WAY TO COMPLETELY TURN OFF THE RADIO SCREEN IS TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL MENUS INTO SETTINGS AND MANUALLY TURN OFF THE SCREEN.

THEY COULD FEEL THE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND SEAT.  THEY CHECK TIRES AGAIN. THEY FELT IT WAS THE TIRES AND WANTED ME TO BUY NEW ONES. TOLD ME THE TIRES WERE NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  THAT DAY I CALLED GOODYEAR AND FOUND OUT MY TIRES WERE UNDER WARRANTY, THEY WOULD BE PRORATED. GOODYEAR CHECK MY TIRES AND THEY ARE FINE.  AT THIS TIME NO ONE CAN FIND THE PROBLEM AND  I FEEL IT HAS BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE VIBRATION IS REALLY STRONG AND GETTING WORSE AND THEY HAVE NO ANSWER.   *TR",

ONE ACTUALLY BELIEVED I WAS JOKING AND ASKED ME TO TURN THE REAL HEADLIGHTS ON, IF THAT SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT TODAY. I HAVE AVOIDED NIGHT DRIVING WITH THIS TRUCK IN FAVOR OF A SEDAN EQUIPPED WITH OEM \"HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE\" HEADLIGHTS EVEN THOUGH DEER REPRESENT MORE OF A SIGNIFICANT DANGER DUE TO THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEDAN (NISSAN) AND THE PICKUP (14 SIERRA). I DO THIS BECAUSE WITH THE NISSAN'S HID HEADLIGHTS I AM CAPABLE OF SEEING THE DEER (OR PEDESTRIANS, DEBRIS, ETC) FROM AN ADEQUATE ENOUGH DISTANCE THAT ALLOWS ME TO SLOW WAY DOWN OR OTHERWISE ACT ACCORDINGLY. THAT IS NOT AN OPTION WITH THE 2014 GMC SIERRA AND IT'S PROJECTOR HEADLIGHTS.     WHILE THE SIERRA MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH LIGHT OUTPUT TO SUFFICE IN WELL LIT TOWNS AND ON WELL LIT ROADWAYS, IT DOES NOT DO SO ON SECLUDED ROADS WHERE DEER ARE MOST PREVALENT AND IN TURN THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SEE.    TURNING THE \"BRIGHTS\" ON MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL AREAS THAT REPRESENT THE POSSIBLE DANGER ONE MIGHT ENCOUNTER SUCH AS PEDESTRIANS, DEBRIS ON THE ROAD, DEER AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, POORLY LIT VEHICLES, ETC. IT DOES HOWEVER ILLUMINATE THE TREES WHICH MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO SOME BUT NOT TOO ME.     I UNDERSTAND GM ATTEMPTING TO SAVE WHERE POSSIBLE, BUT GIVE US THAT NEED BETTER PERFORMING HEADLIGHTS HAVE THE FACTORY OPTION TO UPGRADE THEM TO HID'S, I WOULD HAVE PAID FOR IT, AS WE DID WITH THE  NISSAN, AND AS MY BROTHER DID WITH HIS FORD F150, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE OUTSTANDING HEADLIGHT OUTPUT THANKS TO THE HID'S.   *TR",
