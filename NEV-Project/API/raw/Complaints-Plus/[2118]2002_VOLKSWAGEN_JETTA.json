FRUSTRATED WITH THE VW SERVICE SHOPS, I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO A TRANSMISSION REPAIR - THEY STATED THAT SINCE THIS WAS A SEALED TRANSMISSION I WOULD NEED TO HAVE IT REBUILT WHICH WOULD COST $2,500-$3,500.

STILL SMELLING SMOKE, WE RE-INSPECTED THE VEHICLE, BUT WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE AN ORIGIN OR ANY VISIBLE EVIDENCE.  BOTH SEAT HEATERS WERE ON DURING THE DRIVE HOME, BUT THE SEATS SHOWED NO VISUAL SIGNS OF DAMAGE AFTER PARKING.  NEXT MORNING WE OPENED THE VEHICLE TO DISCOVER THE CABIN WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE WITH AN APPROXIMATE 1?HOLE BURNED UP THRU THE PASSENGER SEAT ON THE LOWER RIGHT BOLSTER.  APPARENTLY THE SEAT HEATER INITIATED A THERMAL EVENT WHICH ERUPTED IN A SEAT FIRE AFTER WE TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND PARKED THE CAR IN THE GARAGE.  FORTUNATELY, THE FIRE DID NOT ENGULF THE VEHICLE OR IT COULD HAVE CAUGHT OUR HOME ON FIRE, RESULTING IN POSSIBLE INJURY OR DEATH TO MY FAMILY.  I BELIEVE WE DODGED A BULLET BECAUSE THE SEAT FIRE DID NOT SUSTAIN ITSELF AND ENGULF THE VEHICLE.  VW HAS AGREED TO REPAIR THE BURNED SEAT AT THEIR EXPENSE AND MAKE A MITIGATION REPAIR.  HOWEVER, VW HAS DECLINED MY REQUEST TO COVER ANY SIMILAR MITIGATION REPAIR TO THE OTHER SEAT.    IN OCTOBER 2004, THE NHTSA ODI CONCLUDED THAT ?DRIVER-SIDE SEAT HEATER MAY FAIL OR MALFUNCTION DUE TO NORMAL VEHICLE USE? BUT ?SUCH FAILURES DO NOT POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR FIRE.?

WE INTERPRETED THEIR OFFER AS A MARKETING STRATEGY TO MAKE US GIVE THEM MORE BUSINESS.

THIS CAUSES THE STEERING COLUMN TO MOVE UP & DOWN, AND BACK & FORTH WHILE DRIVING. THIS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONDITION CAN LEAD TO SEVERAL POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND/OR FATAL SITUATIONS:  - THE DRIVER MAY BE UNABLE TO SAFELY STEER THE CAR.  - UNABLE TO STEER THE CAR PROPERLY, THE VEHICLE OPERATOR MAY ENDANGER HIM/HERSELF & PASSENGERS, OTHER VEHICLES PASSENGERS, PEDESTRIANS, & PROPERTY.  - IN AN ACCIDENT THE DRIVER AIR BAG MAY DEPLOY IN THE WRONG POSITION (TOO HIGH, TOO LOW, TOO CLOSE, TOO FAR AWAY) RESULTING IN A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS (OR FATAL) INJURY.    THE LOCAL VW PARTS DEPT SAYS NO PART IS AVAILABLE TO FIX THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION; AN ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN IS THE ONLY FIX. SUCH EXPENSE IS UNREASONABLE (SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS); STEERING COLUMNS SHOULD LAST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES, NOT 93,000 MILES OR FOUR YEARS.    I MADE THREE GOODWILL CONTACTS WITH VAG (VOLKSWAGEN AUDI GROUP) PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. MY INTENT IN CONTACTING VW WAS TO:  - SEE THAT OTHER VW OWNERS WITH SIMILAR SITUATIONS MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THE STEERING COLUMN MAY NOT BE SECURE AND SAFE.  - THE ONLY CURRENT REPAIR AVAILABLE FROM VW IS AN EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN. MANY OWNERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EASILY AFFORD THIS REPAIR COSTING SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. SUCH A CONDITION MAY LEAD TO ACCIDENTS, INJURIES AND POTENTIAL FATALITIES.  - THE CORRECTION OF THIS CONDITION IS A POTENTIALLY INEXPENSIVE CORRECTION (A PART THAT IS PROBABLY LESS THAN 50-CENTS PER CAR). I FEEL VW SHOULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND CAUSE THE STEERING COLUMN SUPPLIER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND ISSUE A VOLUNTARY CALL-BACK & REPAIR TO VWS HAVING SUCH A STEERING COLUMN, AT NO EXPENSE TO OWNERS, IRRESPECTIVE OF MILEAGE OR TIME SINCE PURCHASE.  IN EACH OF THE 3 CASES VW SAID THE REPAIR WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO EXCESS MILEAGE.  *NM",

I HAVE TRIED TO BE PATIENT WITH THIS DEALERSHIP, BUT SIMPLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY ON AVERAGE, I END UP BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP, GETTING MY CAR SERVICED ON AVERAGE, TWO WEEKS AFTER THE CAR'S INITIAL APPOINTMENT.  THE LAST TIME I WENT IN, I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER.  FIRST, HE DISPARAGINGLY ASKED ME IF I WAS MAKING SURE TO FILL THE GAS TANK WITH PREMIUM GAS, AS IS WRITTEN ON THE GAS FLAP.  HE THEN PROCEEDED TO ASK IF I WAS TIGHTENING THE GAS CAP.  HE REASSURED ME THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE FURTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS SPECIFIC PART, BECAUSE ALL THE PARTS PERTAINING TO THIS SPECIFIC LIGHT HAVE BEEN REPLACED.  LO AND BEHOLD, TWO DAYS AGO, MY MIL LIGHT WENT ON.  ON AVERAGE, EACH TIME I VISIT THIS PARTICULAR DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I END UP PAYING $350-600 DOLLARS.  SOMEHOW, THAT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND TO MY DISMAY, THIS LONG-STANDING, EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.    *JB",

IF THIS IS NOT UNDER YOUR OFFICE'S RESPONSIBILITIES, CAN YOU TELL ME WHO I SHOULD CONTACT NEXT?  BASICALLY THEY TOLD ME IT COULD TAKE THEM 2 TO 3 YEARS TO ISSUE A RECALL IF EVER.  THANK YOU.    I TOOK MY 2002 JETTA IN ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 10TH FOR WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE, BUT $330 DOLLARS LATER WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT.  MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT I NEEDED A NEW OIL PAN.  SOMETHING THAT IS 99% OF THE TIME ONLY REPLACED AFTER AN ACCIDENT OR AFTER 15 YEARS OR SO IF IT'S RUSTED OUT.  THE REASON:  THE OIL PAN ITSELF IS MADE OF ALUMINUM AND THE DRAIN PLUG IS MADE OF STEEL.  ANYONE WITH HALF AN OUNCE OF ENGINEERING OR MATERIALS KNOWLEDGE (SOMETHING I WOULD HOPE AND ASSUME A VOLKSWAGEN PARTS DESIGNER HAS) KNOWS THAT YOU DON'T MANUFACTURE A PART OUT OF A SOFT METAL WHICH HAS SOMETHING SCREWED INTO IT MADE OUT OF A HARDER METAL.  THE THREADS EVENTUALLY GET COMPLETELY STRIPPED AFTER REPEATED OIL CHANGES.  ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE SCHEDULE IN MY OWNER'S MANUAL, OIL CHANGES ARE MANDATORY SERVICE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER WARRANTY.  ALSO THIS COULD VERY WELL PRESENT A SAFETY ISSUE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO LEAKING OIL IF THE PAN WAS DAMAGED SINCE IT'S MADE OF ALUMINUM.    WHAT HAS ANGERED ME THE MOST ABOUT THIS IS THAT VOLKSWAGEN OBVIOUSLY KNOWS ABOUT THIS DESIGN DEFECT AND HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  WHEN MY MECHANIC CALLED THE LOCAL VOLKSWAGEN DEALER (AND WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR) THE PARTS DEPARTMENT TOLD HIM \"OH YEAH, WE KNOW ABOUT THAT PROBLEM.  IN FACT WE STOCK THE REDESIGNED PART\".

WE LIVE NEAR FORT COLLINS, CO; WHEN WE TRAVEL TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WITH LOWER ELEVATION, OUR BRAKES BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION.  INITIALLY, THEY BEGIN TO DRAG; YOU USUALLY HAVE TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION TO GET THEM TO RELEASE.  SOMETIMES YOU CAN PUMP THEM HARD AND GET THEM TO RELEASE.  DURING THIS PHASE THE BRAKES WEAR QUICKLY AND BECOME VERY HOT.  WITHIN A  DAY THE PROBLEM PROGRESSES TO A MUCH WORSE CONDITION.  AS YOU PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE PEDAL FEELS AS THOUGH IT IS PULLING AWAY FROM YOUR FOOT.  AS YOU PRESS A LITTLE MORE, THE PEDAL SUDDENLY PULLS VIOLENTLY FROM YOUR FOOT AND THE VEHICLE BRAKES SLAM ON.  AT THIS TIME THE ABS DOES NOT WORK AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.  WHEN THE BRAKES PULL FROM YOUR FOOT THERE IS A NOISE LIKE AIR BEING SUCKED INTO SOMETHING.  WHEN THE BRAKES SLAM ON IN THIS FASHION, ONE OF SEVERAL THINGS HAPPEN.  THE BRAKES MAY STAY LOCKED ON, LEAVING YOU TO TRY TO GET THEM TO RELEASE, OFTEN IN AN INTERSECTION OR TRAFFIC.  THEY MAY RELEASE ENTIRELY, AND BE OKAY UNTIL THE NEXT BRAKING INCIDENT.  MANY TIMES THEY DRAG SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LIGHT ENOUGH THAT YOU MIGHT JUST THINK THE CAR IS RUNNING POORLY TO SO HEAVILY THAT YOU CAN BARELY MOVE THE CAR WITHOUT KILLING THE ENGINE.  WE WERE MOST RECENTLY IN THE PORTLAND, OREGON AREA WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IT BEGAN TO HAPPEN THE FIRST NIGHT WE WERE IN TOWN, WITH THE DRAGGING.  THE NEXT MORNING WE DROVE TO THE COAST, AND THE MORE SERIOUS MALFUNCTION BEGAN.  WE TRIED TO DRIVE AROUND A SMALL COASTAL TOWN, ONLY TO HAVE TO PARK AND WALK EVERYWHERE WE NEEDED TO GO.  ON THE WAY BACK WE WERE UNFORTUNATE TO FIND OURSELVES IN BUMPER TO BUMPER, STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  WITH NEARLY EVERY SINGLE USE OF THE BRAKES, THEY WOULD SLAM TO THE FLOOR.  WE HAVE TO TRY TO STAY FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM OTHER VEHICLES TO AVOID BEING HIT FROM BEHIND OR SKIDDING INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF US.   *NM",

THE MECHANIC TOLD ME HE HAS SEEN A PROBLEM BEFORE INVOLVING PAINT CONTAMINATION IN THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. BASICALLY, THE INSIDE OF THE TRANSMISSION OIL PAN WHERE THE FLUID SITS IS PAINTED, AND THE HEAT OF THE FLUID CAUSES THE PAINT TO FLAKE OFF AND CONTAMINATE THE FLUID. THIS MECHANIC RECOMMENDED TO HAVE THE TRANNY REPLACED AT A VW DEALER. SO, I TOOK THE CAR TO AN AUTHORIZED VW DEALER AND THEY ALSO CONFIRMED THE PAINT CONTAMINATION PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THEY REPLACED THE TRANNY OIL PAN, A SELONIOD VALVE (N281) AND FLUSHED THE TRANNY FLUID AS RECOMMENDED BY VW OF AMERICA. I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE NEW PAN WAS ALSO PAINTED AND HE COULD NOT ANSWER IF THE PAINT SPEC HAD CHANGED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. I CALLED VW OF AMERICA TO STATE MY CONCERN AND TO REQUEST A NEW TRANSMISSION. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. 9 MONTHS LATER (64,000 MI) MY CAR DOWN SHIFTS TO 4 GEAR WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT 65MI/HR. THE GEAR IS STUCK IN 4TH GEAR EVEN WHEN I COME TO A STOP. I MANAGED TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER WHO HAVE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY VALVE BODY CIRCUIT (N92 VALVE BODY COVER). THE DEALER NOW RECOMMENDS TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED AND SINCE I'M 4,000 MILES BEYOND MY WARRANTY I WILL HAVE THE COVER THE COST. THE DEALER SUGGESTS THAT I SHOULD CALL VW OF AMERICA AND REFERENCE THE CASE FROM THE LAST TIME I CALLED IN APRIL. VWA STATED THEY NEEDED TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND THEY WOULD CALL BACK. AFTER HEARING NOTHING FOR TWO DAYS, I CALLED VWA BACK AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD BACK IN APRIL AND THE BEST THEY COULD DO WAS OFFER HALF THE COST OF THE REPAIR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I SHOULD PAY HALF THE COST WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER REMEDIED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY.*AK",

THE DEALER RESET THE COMPUTER BUT WITHIN IN A WEEK THE CAR WAS EXHIBITING THE SAME SYMPTOMS. AT THAT TIME I CONTACTED VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA AND FILED A COMPLAINT AND INFORMED THEM I WAS GOING TO FILE A LEMON LAW COMPLAINT AGAIN. THE NEXT THING I KNOW A VW REP IS IN TOWN LOOKING AT MY VEHICLE. I WAS THEN INFORMED BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE REP DID SOMETHING TO THE COMPUTER AND NOW I CAN ONLY USE PREMIUM GASOLINE. MY CONCERN IS THAT HE TWEEKED THE COMPUTER AND THAT MY VEHICLE MAY NOT BE MEETING THE FUEL EMISSION STANDARDS.

THE FOLLOWING DAY A SECOND TIRE WENT FLAT.  AGAIN THERE WAS NO NAIL OR EXPLAINABLE CAUSE.  A SECOND TIRE WAS ORDERED.  WHEN THE TIRES CAME IN I WENT DOWN TO HAVE THEM INSTALLED.  I ASKED THE SHOP TO LOOK AT THE FRONT TWO TIRES TO SEE THAT THEY WERE OK AS I HAD NOW BECOME SUSPICIOUS OF THESE TIRES.  THE SHOP FOUND THE FRONT TWO TIRES WERE SPLIT OUT ON THE INSIDE SIDEWALLS AS WELL.  THE SHOP CONTACTED GOODYEAR WHO WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES FREE AND ASKED TO SEND THE TIRES BACK FOR EVALUATION.  THE TIRES THAT ARE BEING RETURNED ARE THE SAME AS WHAT WAS JUST PUT ON MY CAR AND FRANKLY I AM NOT ALL THAT WARM AND FUZZY THAT THEY ARE SAFE TO DRIVE ON.

I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT DESPITE WHAT I'VE READ ABOUT THE RECENT RECALL RE: THE IGNITION COILS THAT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY FAILED BEFORE HAVING ANY REPLACED. (THE ONE REPLACED LAST MAY WAS REPLACED WITH THE SAME POOR QUALITY COIL.) IT'S ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND THE CAR HAS BEEN TOWED FOR THE 4TH IGNITION COIL FAILURE. I CAN'T TAKE IT.

IN AUGUST OF 2002 THE SWITCH IN THE BRAKE PEDAL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUT THE CAR INTO GEAR HAD WENT OUT. THE DEALER REPLACED THE SWITCH AND WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR THE BRAKES WERE GRABING AS I LEFT THE DEALER, I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT BACK AND TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT RIGHT. A MECHANIC AND I ROAD TESTED THE CAR AND HE STOPPED AND PHYSICALLY PULLED UP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO MAKE THE BRAKES RELEASE. HE STATED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. THAT EVENING THE CAR DID THE SAME THING WHILE I WAS ON THE INTERSTAE AND CAUSED SUCH A DRAG ON THE WHEELS THAT YOU COULD NOT GO OVER 40MPH. I WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF AT AN EXIT AND PULLED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO MAKE IT RELEASE. THE NEXT DAY ON MY WAY TO WORK I HAD THE CAR IN CRUISE CONTROL AND WHEN I TAPPED THE BRAKE FOR CRUISE TO RELEASE, THE BRAKES LOCKED ON THE CAR AGAIN AND I HAD TO PULL UP ON THE BRAKE WITH MY FOOT TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TURN LOOSE. THE CRUISE DID NOT RELEASE, IT GOT STUCK, I HAD TO TURN IT OFF WITH THE SWITCH ON THE STEERING MECHANISIM. I TOLD THE DEALER THAT I WOULD NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I FELT THIS PROBLEM WAS DANGEROUS AND THEY HAD IT TOWED FOR SERVICE. THEY STATED THE SWITCH THEY HAD JUST REPLACED THE DAY BEFORE WAS FAULTY. I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE BEARINGS AND ROTARS FOR POSSIBLE DAMAGE DUE TO THE BRAKES STICKING WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I FEEL ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER AND ONE MAY HAVE BEEN PRECLUDED THE OTHERS. AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY THE CAR IS BACK AT THE DEALER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND I JUST HAPPEN TO BE 2,000 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY.

THIS PROBLEM CAUSES THE ENGINE TO MISFIRE TO THE POINT OF THE CAR WILL STALL AND CAN NOT BE DRIVEN. MY 2002 JETTA 1.8T WAGON HAS BEEN TOWED TO THE SHOP TWICE IN THE PAST MONTH FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. THE FIRST TIME ONLY ONE COIL PACK WAS REPLACED, LEAVING THREE FAULTY ONES STILL INSTALLED. A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THE FIRST COIL PACK WAS REPLACED ANOTHER ONE FAILED. CURRENTLY MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR 15 DAYS WAITING ON THE PART TO ARRIVE FROM EUROPE. MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR 19 DAYS TOTAL IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS. WHEN THE PART ARRIVES, VOLKSWAGEN CLAIMS THEY CAN ONLY REPLACE ONE DAMAGED COIL PACK (NOT ALL FOUR FAULTY ONES) BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE IN SUCH HIGH DEMAND. THE VW SERVICE GARAGE IN DURHAM, NC (SOUTHERN STATES VW) TOLD ME THEY HAVE 8 CARS WAITING ON THESE PARTS TO ARRIVE. THE NATIONAL VW CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER TOLD ME VW IS REPLACING ONLY ONE COIL PACK PER CAR, TRYING TO GET AS MANY CARS BACK ON THE ROAD AS POSSIBLE, ADMITTING THAT ANY OF THE OTHER ORIGINAL COIL PACKS MAY FAIL AGAIN AT ANY TIME. IF THERE ARE EIGHT CARS ON THE LOT IN DURHAM, NC THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF VWS ACROSS THE US IN GARAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM! VW OF AMERICA REALIZES THIS PROBLEM, YET THEY REFUSE TO DO A RECALL DUE TO LIMITED SUPPLY OF PARTS. MEANWHILE EVERYONE WILL BE STILL STUCK WITH A CAR WHO'S ENGINE MAY FAIL AT ANY TIME DUE TO THIS FAULTY ENGINE PART! THIS IS A DANGEROUS CAR TO OWN!

MY CAR WAS ON SALE AND ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE MANAGERS (HIS NAME IS SAID, NOT SURE ABOUT SPELLING), THEY HAD 3 JETTA'S ON SALE SO I THINK THERE ARE TWO MORE JETTA OWNERS THAT PROBABLY DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RECALL. ALL OWNERS SHOULD RECEIVE RECALL NOTICE NO MATTER WHEN THEY BUY A CAR, BEFORE OR AFTER THE RECALL DATE. DEALERSHIPS LIKE SUNNYVALE VOLKSWAGEN PUT CAR OWNERS AND OTHER DRIVERS' LIVES IN DANGER. ALSO, CUSTOMER SUPPORT PEOPLE AT VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC.
