THE STUTTERING, WHILE ACCELERATING OR COMING TO A STOP, WAS (AND STILL IS) HORRIBLE. I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE IN ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO GET THE TRANSMISSION 'FIXED', TO NO AVAIL. I'M STILL DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS 80K MILES LATER. THE FIRST TWO WINTERS THAT I HAD OWNED THE VEHICLE MY DOOR LOCKS WOULD NOT ENGAGE, IN DRY, 40 DEGREE TEMPERATURES. SO I WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE AND HOLD MY DOOR CLOSED UNTIL THE CAR HEATED UP AND THE LOCKS ENGAGED. I TRIED WD-40 AND SPRAYS MEANT SPECIFICALLY TO UNFREEZE LOCKS. NEITHER WORKED. AND THE LOCKS WOULD OCCASIONALLY DISENGAGE WHILE DRIVING MY MORNING COMMUTE ON THE HIGHWAY. NO RECALL UNTIL TWO YEARS LATER, AFTER COMPLAINING COUNTLESS TIMES. BUT BACK TO THE TRANSMISSION, I WAS DRIVING HOME AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK AND ENDED UP STUCK IN CINCINNATI, OH. A MESSAGE POPPED UP ON MY DASH READING 'TRANSMISSION FAULT' ADVISING ME TO TAKE MY CAR TO A DEALER. TURNING OFF THE ENGINE DIDN'T HELP, AND I COULDN'T DRIVE OVER 20 MILES PER HOUR BECAUSE THE CAR WOULDN'T SHIFT OVER 1ST OR 2ND GEAR. LUCKILY I'M AN EXPERIENCED DRIVER AND WAS ABLE TO DODGE MULTIPLE CARS THAT ALMOST SLAMMED INTO ME ON THE STREET, DUE TO MY SUDDEN BRAKING. WHEN CONTACTING FORD IT TOOK THEM 5 HOURS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DEALERS TO FINALLY SEND ME A TOW TRUCK. I GET THE CAR BACK, SAME PROBLEMS. OVER AND OVER. A MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM (WHICH IT'S BECOMING EVER MORE CLEAR THAT THEY STILL DON'T, NOR WILL THEY EVER). FORD'S COMPENSATION FOR THIS PROBLEM WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL. OFFERING A REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION WITH THE EXACT SAME TRANS THAT GAVE ME PROBLEMS I'M THE FIRST PLACE.

THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH WHILE I'M DRIVING AS WELL AS WHEN THE CAR IS NOT EVEN ON (MOST LIKELY DRAINING THE BATTERY, SINCE THE RADIO LIGHTS UP WHEN MAKING THE NOISE).   TODAY WAS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING. I LEFT MY HOUSE TO WALK TO MY CAR, AND COULD HEAR FROM MY BACKYARD (TO THE SIDE OF THE DRIVEWAY WHERE IT WAS PARKED) A LOUD SCREECHING, POPPING, CRACKLING NOISE. I WALKED UP TO MY CAR AND, SURE ENOUGH, ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T EVEN UNLOCKED, STILL HAD ALL THE DOORS SHUT, AND I HADN'T EVEN TOUCHED IT, IT WAS MAKING THESE NOISES THAT COULD BE HEARD FROM A DISTANCE. I GOT INTO MY CAR, HOPING STARTING IT WOULD HELP, BUT THE NOISES CONTINUED. IT WAS SUCH A STARTLING NOISE, I COULDN'T IMAGINE DRIVING WITH IT GOING.   I ENDED UP GOING BACK INSIDE TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON HOW TO HELP IT. WHEN I CAME BACK OUT HALF AN HOUR LATER IT WAS STILL GOING. IN MY RESEARCH I SAW MANY OTHER FORD FOCUS 2013 OWNERS HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES. I REALIZE THIS IS CONSIDERED A COSMETIC ISSUE, WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND SINCE A RADIO ISN'T NECESSARY. BUT NOW IT HAS ESCALATED TO A CONTINUOUS NOISE THAT CAN BE HEARD OUTSIDE OF MY CAR AND GOES EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT ON-- I FEEL IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.   I ENDED UP TAKING OUT THE FUSE #79 AFTER READING OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE SIMILARLY, AND CHECKING WITH MY OWNER'S MANUAL. I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT DOING THIS SINCE THAT FUSE ALSO WORKS WITH THE HAZARD LIGHTS AND THE DOOR LOCKS.

I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM BUT CALLED BACK A FEW TIMES, TELLING THEM I HAD NEW CODES COMING UP ON MY OBD SENSOR (FIXD) THE CAR HAD BEEN RUNNING ROUGH, STALLING OUT WHILE IDLING/STOPPED.. THEY ASSURED ME IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.  THEY DID NOT GET PART IN BY 2/7/2019 AND I MISSED MY INSPECTION.  TWO NEW CODES CAME UP ON MY CAR AND I CALLED ANGRILY ON 2/14/2019 TO ASK IF THEY NEED ME TO TAKE CAR TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION, AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE JUST ABOUT TO CALL ME TO TELL ME PARTS CAME IN.. WE SCHEDULED FOR 2/22/2019 TO HAVE RECALL FIXED.  THEY TOLD ME RENTAL CARS AREN'T COVERED UNDER THIS RECALL WHEN I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEMS WITH SCHEDULING SO MANY APPOINTMENTS AND HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING OTHER TRANSPORTATION.  ON 2/17/2019 MY CAR SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING, ON A MAJOR ROAD (ROUTE 40).  I WAS ABLE TO COAST DOWN A SIDE STREET AND PULL INTO DRIVEWAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL.

NOW, I'M AFRAID MORE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE, AS THERE ARE 7 TOTAL CODES ON MY OBD SENSOR(THERE WERE 3 WHEN I FIRST CALLED ABOUT RECALL).

THEY HAVE ALSO TOLD ME THEY ARE BUSY AND MAYBE AWHILE ANYWAY AND THEY CANT GIVE ME A RENTAL CAR. I HAVE ALMOST BEEN RAN OVER, BEEN STRANDED AND MISSED WORK BECAUSE OF THIS AND NOW I HAVE NO WAY TO GO IF THEY DO GET PARTS IN TO FIX THIS. PRIOR TO THIS MY TRANSMISSION WAS CAUSING MY CAR TO DIE AND THE DOOR HINGE IS UNDER RECALL AND THEY CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED TOTALLY. I DONT TRUST THEM TO FIX IT AND THESE ARE LEMONS AND THEY KNEW THIS AND PEOPLE HAVE CRASHED BECAUSE OF THIS!! THEY ARE LYING AND SHOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THESE CARS. THIS IS UNFAIR , UNETHICAL AND DANGEROUS. YOU CANT DO THIS AND RISK SO MANY LIVES. DO SOMETHING BEFORE PEOPLE DIE PLEASE!!1 IT HAS STOPPED ON HIGHWAY, PARKING LOT AND CITY ROAD AND RURAL ROAD. IT HAS HAPPENED MANY MANY TIMES.",

GOT OUT TO INVESTIGATE.....NOTHING. VEHICLE THEN ROLLED OFF ROAD (DECLINE IN TERRAIN) LANDING RESTED IN A CHAIN LINK FENCE. UPON INSPECTION, DISCOVERED THAT MOTOR MOUNTS HAD FAILED CAUSING MOTOR TO DROP FORWARDS TOWARDS RADIATOR THEREFORE INDICATING CRASH AND DEPLOYING AIRBAGS. ALL COMPONENTS CONNECTED TO MOTOR RIPPED FORWARDS AS WELL. THANKFULLY ALSO NO INJURY. IF THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED AT HIGH SPEEDS, SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH COULD HAVE RESULTED. THERE IS NO REASON OR EXCUSE FOR FAILURE OF MOTOR MOUNTS. THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECT. CONTACTED FORD AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL NUMBER I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN. REQUESTED ONLY TO ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUE. THEY ISSUED A CLAIM, DISMISSED IT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO SPEAK TO ANYONE WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. CONTACTED CHEVY DEALERSHIP WHERE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED, THEY SAID FORD WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THEN TOOK VEHICLE TO FORD DEALERSHIP TO RUN DIAGNOSTIC TO EVALUATE WHY AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. THIS VEHICLE CONTAINS A MODULE THAT CONTAINS DATA PERTAINING TO AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS RETRIEVING THE DATA! ONLY FORD FIELD REP CAN DO THIS. TOWED VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP TO PERFORM DIAGNOSTIC TO NEXT BE REFERRED TO REP FOR DATA RETRIEVAL. EMPLOYEES OF DEALERSHIP WERE NOT ALLOWED BY THEIR SUPERVISOR TO EXAMINE THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE UNDER THE HOOD. SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE MOTOR MOUNTS ON THIS VEHICLE. OTHER VEHICLES MAY HAVE THIS PROBLEM AS WELL.

IT IS THE STEERING MOTOR AND WILL COST ME $1800 TO FIX.  I HAVE FILED A CLAIM WITH FORD AND THEY REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS STEERING DEFECT.  UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH, THE STEERING MOTOR HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH FORD'S FROM 2010-2014, WITH DOCUMENTED CASUALTIES DUE TO THE STEERING LOCKING UP.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED ANY LONGER.  RECALL THE STEERING MOTORS NOW, TAKE ACTION.  I CAN'T EVEN TRADE THIS CAR IN FOR ANOTHER BECAUSE THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE DETERIORATES WITH EVERY RECALL, INCLUDING THE RECALL OF THEIR FAULTY TRANSMISSION ISSUES.  GET THESE CARS OFF THE ROADS, THEY ARE A HAZARD!",

FROM TIME TO TIME, MY OIL LIGHT WILL COME ON AS MY ENGINE STALLS OUT AND TRIES TO 'DIE' AND I CAN PRESS THE GAS TO 'REVIVE' THE ENGINE AND KEEP IT FROM SHUTTING OFF. THIS REPAIR OF THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS ESTIMATED TO COST $2,000 TO REPAIR AND I JUST DON'T HAVE IT. I LISTED MY CAR ONLINE FOR $5,400 AS IS AND HAVE NO ONE INTERESTED IN IT AT THAT PRICE AFTER I'VE INVESTED NEARLY $20,000 IN THIS CAR IN THE 4 YEARS I'VE BEEN MAKING PAYMENTS, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ON IT. I'VE ALSO HAD THE POWER STEERING REPLACED ON THIS VEHICLE WHEN I HAD AROUND 80,000 MILES ON IT. THE POWER STEERING FAILED WHILE IN MOTION AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE IS A DANGEROUS ONE. BUYER BEWARE.",

ONE YEAR LATER CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, BUT OCCASIONALLY TURNED OFF AND BACK ON AGAIN (EVERY FEW DAYS) BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS WITH DEALER.  PURGE VALVE REPLACED AGAIN AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AS I WAS LEAVING DEALER CODE 0420.       RETURNED TO DEALER AND PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED FINALLY AS PARTIALLY COLLAPSED FUEL TANK (DIFFICULT TO SEE UNLESS CAR WAS ON A LIFT.)  DEALER RECOMMENDS REPLACING FUEL TANK, FUEL PUMP, EVAP CAN AND OTHER ASSOCIATED PARTS.       BESIDES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THE ONLY SYMPTOM IS OCCASIONAL LACK OF POWER WHEN ACCELERATING.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS SYMPTOM IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE \"SHUDDER\" PROBLEM FIXED BY REPLACING THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.  SO, HAVING RECENTLY DONE THAT CLUTCH ASSEMBLY REPLACEMENT THIS FELT LIKE A SHADOW OF THE FORMER PROBLEM AND I IGNORED THE ISSUE UNTIL I GOT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS.     I CONTACTED FORD DIRECTLY TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REIMBURSE FOR THE EXPENSIVE REPAIRS.  THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL AND I AM PAST THE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY SO THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST...THEY WERE VERY POLITE, BUT UNWILLING TO PAY.    ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT:  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, WHEN IT CAME ON, WOULD USUALLY STAY ON FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN EITHER LATE AT NIGHT OR EARLY IN THE MORNING I WOULD FIND THAT IT WAS OFF.  AND IT WOULD STAY OFF FOR A FEW DAYS AT A TIME AS WELL.  MY ASSUMPTION WAS THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF MY VEHICLE (WHICH IS BLACK) BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE OFF WHEN IT WAS COOL AND DARK OR OVERCAST.           I AM LISTING THE DATE AS JUNE 2017 BUT THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS REGARDS THE PURGE VALVE, BEGAN A YEAR EARLIER.  BUT THE INTERMITTENT CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS AND SECOND PURGE VALVE REPLACEMENT AND CURRENT FUEL TANK COLLAPSE BEGAN IN JUNE 2017",

AFTER THIS, I ORDERED A PAIR OF ADJUSTABLE CONTROL ARMS AND DECREASED THE CAMBER BY 1.5 DEGREES NEGATIVE, AND TOOK OUT OF EACH SIDE 1/10TH TOE IN (BOTH ADJUSTMENT STILL WITHIN FORDS SPECIFICATION RANGE). I DOCUMENTED TIRE WEAR BEFORE IT MADE A ROUND TRIP TO DENVER, CO FROM GREENVILLE, TX (APPROX. 1,640 MILES). UPON ITS RETURN THE WEAR WAS EVEN ACROSS THE TREAD.      I AM WRITING THIS MEMO TO REPORT THAT FORD HAS A SAFETY PROBLEM WITH THE EXCESSIVE REAR TIRE WEAR BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE ANOTHER ROUND TRIP FROM GREENVILLE TO LOUISVILLE WITHOUT HAVING TIRE FAILURE.",

HOWEVER, RECENTLY I HAD A MAJOR MECHANICAL PROBLEM THAT COULD VERY EASILY BE FATAL FOR ANY DRIVER. THE POWER STEERING COMPLETELY FAILED AND LOCKED UP THE STEERING WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  LUCKILY FOR ME I WAS   WITHIN 10 FEET OF MY DRIVEWAY GOING ABOUT THREE MILES PER HOUR.  I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE FORD DEALER WHERE THEY WANTED OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR THE POWER STEERING.   IF ANYONE IS DRIVING THIS CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AND THIS PROBLEM OCCURS, I BELIEVE THE PROBABILITY OF A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR FATALITY WOULD BE VERY HIGH. I WAS TOLD BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP THAT THE POWER STEERING IS ELECTRONIC SO WHEN IT GOES, IT BECOMES UNSTEERABLE.   ALARMINGLY, WHEN SPEAKING WITH DEALERSHIP AND THE FORD AREA REGIONAL MANAGER THEY DID NOT REGARD THIS AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  IN FACT, THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS A DEFECT AS IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTEE. I ASKED  IF THIS WAS NOT DEFECTIVE, HOW COULD THIS OCCUR AT 28,300 MILES?  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS COULD HAPPEN IF IT WAS HIT BUT ADMITTED THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THIS.  I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS CAR HAS NOT EVEN RUN OVER  A POT HOLE.  SINCE NO ONE IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY, I NEED TO DOCUMENT THIS PROBLEM AS ONE THAT CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT IF NOT RECALLED OR CORRECTED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY.  THIS IS A MUCH MORE SEVERE PROBLEM THAN THE AUTO PROBLEM A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE CARS WERE ACCIDENTALLY  RUNNING PEOPLE OVER WHEN STARTING .  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.    IMAGINE YOUR FAMILY DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT SIXTY MILES AN HOUR AND THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS, I BELIEVE MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBILITY BEFORE THEY PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE. I FOR ONE WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED MINE!",

I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A FORD DEALERSHIP, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE PURGE VALVE, WAS STUCK IN THE OPEN POSITION CAUSING MY FUEL PUMP TO DELIVER TOO MUCH FUEL TO THE ENGINE, AND CREATED A VACUUM PRESSURE SO STRONG THAT IT WARPED MY TANK AND DAMAGED MY FUEL PUMP AND FUEL SENSOR, MAKING MY SENSOR THINK THERE WAS MORE GAS IN THE TANK THAN THERE REALLY WAS. THEY INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW PURGE VALVE, A NEW EVAPORATOR CANISTER, A NEW FUEL TANK AND FUEL PUMP, TOTALING $2100 AND WHICH WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE EMISSIONS COMPONENTS ARE ONLY COVERED FOR 2 YEARS OR 25K MILES THROUGH FORD.

THEY AGAIN ORDERED PARTS AND REPLACED DEFECTIVE ONES WITH OTHER PARTS.  ON 1/18/16 THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER BECAUSE ALL THE OIL HAD LEAKED OUT OF THE CAR. THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AND THERE WAS A COMPUTER MESSAGE STATING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION. AGAIN THE CAR WAS AT THE DEALER FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHILE PARTS WERE ORDERED AND INSTALLED.  ON 2/16/16 THE CAR AGAIN WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALER. THIS TIME EXTENSIVE WORK WAS DONE ON THE CAR. THREE ENGINES WERE ORDERED AND ANOTHER CLUTCH WAS INSTALLED. I RECEIVED MY CAR BACK THE WEEK OF APRIL 5 (6 WEEKS LATER).  ON 7/11/16, THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER (50+ MILES AWAY) BECAUSE THE COMPUTER MESSAGE READ TRANSMISSION HOT STOP CAR IMMEDIATELY. AGAIN ANOTHER CLUTCH WAS PUT IN WITH OTHER PARTS DUE TO THE CLUTCH BREAKING. MY CAR WAS AT THE DEALER FOR ANOTHER 6 DAYS.",

IT NOW HAPPENS FROM PULLING FORWARD FROM EVERY STOP, LIKE FROM A STOP SIGN OR TRAFFIC LIGHT.  THE CARS FEELS LIKE THERE IS NO POWER TO THE WHEELS AND WHEN THE TRANSMISSION CATCHES IT LUNGES FROWARD.  THE TRANSMISSION FEELS LIKE IT IS SHIFTING BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND GEAR AND VIBRATES BADLY.  THE SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING WORSE AND NOW THE SYMPTOMS ARE WORSE AND IT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TIME YOU START FROM A STOP.  IT IS ALSO WORSE IF YOU ARE ON AN INCLINE OR SLIGHT HILL ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS CAN OCCUR ON A FLAT ROAD.  THE SYMPTOMS ALSO OCCUR IN REVERSE.  THE PROBLEM IS NOW HAPPENING ALMOST ALL THE TIME.  THE CAR DOES NOT APPEAR SAFE TO DRIVE.  THE CAR CURRENTLY HAS ONLY 49000 MILES.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR MY DAUGHTER AND NOW I CAN NOT LET HER DRIVE IT SINCE SHE COMMUTES 75 MILES A DAY.  MY DAUGHTER NOW HAS TO USE HER MOM'S CAR AND SINCE I AM HANDICAPPED I CAN NOT DRIVE THE FOCUS SO MY WIFE HAS TO AND I FEEL SHE IS AT RISK OF INJURY OR WORSE.  I AM OVER 50 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR DO THIS.  I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER FOCUS OWNERS AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING TO FORD TO HAVE THEM FIX THE TRANSMISSIONS BEFORE A DEATH OCCURS.  NOT ONLY DO THE DEALERSHIPS NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE SAYING NOTHING IS WRONG.

THEY KEPT IT OVER THE WEEKEND TO REPROGRAM THE PCM/TCM, REPLACED BOTH THE INNER INPUT SHAFT SEALS, THE CLUTCH, AND A LEAKING BEARING. THE ODOMETER WAS AT 59,936 DURING THIS SERVICE.  MY QUESTIONS TO FORD: IS THE NEW CLUTCH SITTING IN MY CAR ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL? OR WILL THIS CLUTCH FAIL 30,000 MILES FROM NOW LIKE BEFORE? IF SO, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE? WHAT IS YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THE FORD FOCUS TRANSMISSION?",

THE SECOND IS 14M02 WHICH REPLACES/REPROGRAMS THEIR FAULTY TCM (TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE).  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I HAVE A SALVAGE TITLE VEHICLE DUE TO COSMETIC DAMAGE TO BODY PANELS.  AS SUCH, EVEN THOUGH FORD IS ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IS FAULTY, THEY WON'T COVER THE COST TO REPAIR THEIR FAULTY TRANSMISSION SEALS AND CLUTCH (PROGRAM 14M01).

HOOKING UP MY OBD2 COMPUTER I GOT THE FOLLOWING CODES: P2862, P2837, P2862 (AGAIN) AND P287B. I DID NOTICE ON BOTH DAYS IT FAILED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT GO INTO SPORT/MANUAL SHIFT MODE. I ATTEMPTED TO CLEAR THE CODES AND THE P2862 WOULD NOT CLEAR AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS SO I CALLED FORD ROADSIDE.  LATE IN THE 3 HOUR WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK THE CAR STARTED AND THE CODE SEEMED TO HAVE CLEARED, I WAS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND REVERSE IN THE PARKING LOT.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS SOMEHOW TRIGGERED BY HIGHER TEMPERATURE DRIVES BUT NOT THAT HIGH, AND AT LEAST A 20-25 MILE DRIVE.  SATURDAY IT WAS ABOUT 73 DEGREES WHEN IT FAILED AND MONDAY IT WAS IN THE HIGH 60S.  WHEN I DROVE TO WORK MONDAY MORNING IT WAS IN THE LOW 50S.

THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN FORD WILL BE PROVIDING CLUTCH PARTS LET ALONE WHATEVER ELSE IS BROKE.

I TOOK IT IN ON 5/27/15  AND THE DEALER CONFIRMED I NEED CLUTCHES REPLACED AGAIN.  HOWEVER, THE PARTS ARE BACKLOGGED AND IT WILL TAKE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS!    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY FACTOR. THE SHUDDER AND GRINDING, I CAN LIVE WITH FOR A WHILE. THE HESITATION WHEN PULLING OUT INTO HEAVY TRAFFIC IS UNACCEPTABLE.  IN ADDITION, A 100,000 WARRANTY WITH A PROBLEM OCCURRING EVERY 20,000 MILES MEANS SOMEONE WILL EVENTUALLY BE FACED WITH A HUGE REPAIR BILL, NOT TO MENTION THE DIMINISHED VALUE OF THE CAR FOR RESALE OR TRADE IN DUE TO THIS MANUFACTURES DEFECT.

VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN SEVEN TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND FORD REFUSES TO REPLACE THIS TRANSMISSION .FORD HAS EXTENDED THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY TO 100,000 MILES AND I WAS OUTWARDLY TOLD THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS TRANSMISSION ON THIS VEHICLE TYPE.  YOU ONLY HAVE TO SURF THE WEB TO FIND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS FOCUS TRANSMISSION. THEY NEED TO REPLACE THIS TRANSMISSION OR EXTEND THE WARRANTY INDEFINITELY.",

THE SAME PROBLEM THEN RETURNED ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER, I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE FORD DEALER FOR YET ANOTHER REPAIR ON 9/6/13. THEY REPROGRAMMED THE BCM. THE SAME PROBLEM RETURNED 4 MONTHS LATER. THEN I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR CO. WITH A TRANSMISSION WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR 7 YEARS AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL 5 YEAR WARRANTY.I CALLED THE SERVICE PERSON AT THE FORD DEALER TO INFORM THEM THE SAME PROBLEM HAS RETURNED. THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THAT FORD WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAD NO REPAIR OPTIONS AT THIS TIME AND NOT TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR REPAIR. AT THIS POINT THE PROBLEM WITH CLUTCH SHUDDER IS CONSTANT, AND ROLLS BACK ALMOST ALL THE TIME. I HAVE SEARCHED ONLINE AND HAVE FOUND MANY FORD FOCUS OWNERS WITH SAME ISSUES. I FEEL THE VEHICLE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNSAFE AND UNRELIABLE. IT IS BECOMING EVIDENT THAT FORD MOTOR CO. IS NOT DOING ENOUGH OR ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. ANY HELP YOUR ADMINISTRATION CAN GIVE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.      *TR",

IT HAPPENED AGAIN WHEN CHANGING LANES WHEN IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  TOOK IT IN AND A NEW CLUTCH WAS INSTALLED.  IT HAS BEEN IN TO RE-PROGRAM SINCE THEN AND IN BETWEEN RE-PROGRAMMING HAVE PUT UP WITH THE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU ARE TIRED OF WASTING TIME AT THE DEALER GETTING THE SAME RE-PROGRAMMING DONE ONLY TO HAVE IT DONE AGAIN.    JANUARY 22, 2014 UPON TURNING THE CORNER LOST CAPABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO SPEED UP BEYOND 12 MILES PER HOUR.  CAR CURRENTLY IN SHOP AND DEALER HAS SAID CLUTCHES WERE BAD AND WAITING FOR PARTS TO REPAIR. THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS OF SOMETHING WRONG ON THE DASHBOARD.  LUCKILY, I WAS CLOSE TO HOME AND THIS OCCURRED AT A REASONABLE HOUR TO GET IT INTO THE DEALER.    I HAVE CALLED FORD THREE TIMES WITHOUT A RESOLUTION.  I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE SINCE I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  IT IS ALSO GOING TO COST ME TO TRADE THIS VEHICLE IN TO ANOTHER COMPANY SINCE THEY ALL KNOW OF THE FOCUS PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT WANT ANOTHER FORD.    FORD HAS SAID THAT THE ENGINEERS ARE WORKING ON THIS BUT I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR TWO YEARS AND CONTINUE TO SUFFER.   *TR",

THEY REPLACE TCM AND SEND ME HOME. YESTERDAY PROBABLY 2 MONTHS AFTER VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPONENT HAS BEEN REPLACED VEHICLE STARTS TO SHUDDER HORRIBLE PROBABLY THE WORST I'VE EXPERIENCED TO DATE SO I TAKE IT TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY INFORM ME I NEED ANOTHER CLUTCH!!!  THE VEHICLE HAS 48K MILES ON IT I AM SICK OF WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I CAN ACCELERATE AND MERGE INTO TRAFFIC WITHOUT THE VEHICLE GETTING REAR ENDED BECAUSE THE CLUTCHES ARE SLIPPING. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU  *TR",

IT GOT WORSE TO THE POINT THAT TWICE WHEN TURNING OUT INTO TRAFFIC WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD ENOUGH ROOM TO ENTER TRAFFIC IT SEEMED TO WANT TO STALL AND I HAD TO STEER IT BACK INTO THE TURN LANE SO AS NOT TO GET HIT. THE CAR VERY OFTEN SMELLED OF BURNT RUBBER THOUGH AT THE TIME I EXPLAINED IT AWAY AS BEING FROM OTHER CARS NEARBY. IN AUGUST 2014 I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A OIL CHANGE AND FOUND OUT THAT A SEAL BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED AND I HAD A MAJOR OIL LEAK. THIS WAS UNBELIEVABLE FOR A CAR WITH JUST 35,000 MILES AND LUCKY ME I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THOSE PARTS FROM FORD FOR 100, 000 MILES. FORD NOTIFIED ME THE NEXT WEEK ABOUT THE WARRANTY ONLY AFTER THE REPAIR. THE CAR DROVE BETTER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT THEN THE SHUDDERS RETURNED AND BEGAN TO WORSEN. I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT IN AND HAVE FORD LOOK AT IT  AGAIN BUT THEN ON 9-14-2014  I WAS EXITING MY CAR AND THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING ODOR OF BURNT RUBBER COMING FROM THE ENGINE.

I AM IN FEAR OF MY WIFE AND MY SAFETY, I ALMOST GOT REAR ENDED BY A BIG 1 TON DIESEL TRUCK BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE FROM STOP. I TOOK IT THE  DEALER AND THE CAR WAS \"REPAIRED\" BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM. AFTER TAKING IT HOME 2 WEEKS LATER I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK BECAUSE THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE OCCURRING. FORD SERVICE ASSURED ME THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR. ME BEING A CHEMICAL PLANT WORKER WORKING OVERNIGHTS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR A THIRD TIME DURING THEIR BUSINESS HOURS. FIRST CHANCE I GOT I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP A MONTH LATER TO GET IT FIXED AGAIN. I TALKED TO THE DEALER MANAGER AND HE GUARANTEED ME HE WOULD HELP ME WITH THIS ISSUE, HE TOOK ME TO THE FORD SERVICE MANAGER JUST FOR HIM TO TELL ME \"ITS NORMAL\" FOR THAT CAR TO DO THAT. THEY SAID ALL THEY COULD DO IS SOME COMPUTER RESET TO THE CAR AND GAVE IT BACK TO ME. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THE CAR WILL START SHAKING AGAIN EVENTUALLY AND THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO FIX THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE TRANSMISSION WAS DESIGNED. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF FILING A LEMON LAW COMPLAINT AGAINST FORD. WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD VEHICLE AGAIN.  *TR",

I CALLED MY DEALER, NAZARETH FORD IN NAZARETH, PA, TO REPORT THE ISSUE. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THIS WAS \"NORMAL\" FOR THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH IS A \"MANUAL AUTOMATIC\" TRANSMISSION. I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT I WAS ADVISED TO DRIVE 500 MILES AND SEE IF THE PROBLEM CORRECTED ITSELF. I WAS DISCOURAGED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT, SINCE THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE \"NORMAL\" AND I HAD NOT REACHED 500 MILES YET TO SEE IF IT WOULD IMPROVE. IT NEVER DID AND HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. LAST WEEK AFTER ALMOST A YEAR AND 17,500 MILES WITH NO IMPROVEMENT, I WAS FED UP. I CALLED THE DEALER TO MAKE AN AN APPOINTMENT. THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR TWO DAYS AND REPORTED THAT THEY REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION. I PICKED THE CAR UP LAST SATURDAY AND AFTER 15 MINUTES OR LESS, THE ISSUES RETURNED. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AGAIN AND THE PERSON DID NOT RETURN MY PHONE CALL. I VISITED IN PERSON AND WAS ADVISED AGAIN THAT I SHOULD DRIVE ANOTHER 500 MILES SO THE REPROGRAM COULD TAKE EFFECT. THE DEALER COMMENTED THAT A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS HAVE COME BACK FOR PREMATURE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENTS, WHICH DID NOT LEAVE ME WITH A GREAT FEELING. THIS ISSUE HAS PROVED TO BE POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, SUCH AS COMING TO A STOP AT THE END OF AN INTERSECTION, RED LIGHT, OR HIGHWAY RAMP BEFORE ACCELERATING BACK UP TO SPEED AND CLIMBING ANY SORT OF HILL. JERKING AND GRINDING PREVENTS THE CAR FROM ACCELERATING SMOOTHLY. WHILE I AM OTHERWISE HAPPY WITH THE FEATURES OF THE CAR, THIS IS A DEAL-BREAKER. WITH THE NUMBER OF MILES THAT I DRIVE, I AM SCARED THAT THIS IMPROPER FUNCTIONING WILL CAUSE A COLLISION IF LEFT UNRESOLVED.    *JS",

I HAD NO CONTROL OVER MY OWN VEHICLE. ABOUT A MILE OR TWO AWAY, I REACHED MY DESTINATION. I PARKED AND THEN STARTED TO DRIVE AGAIN WHERE MY CAR THEN STOPPED AND I HAD TO DECLARE IT INOPERABLE. THE NEXT DAY, I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED. COME TO FIND OUT, THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS I COMPLAINED ABOUT TO THE DEALER WERE NOT NORMAL AND ANY DAY MY CAR WAS GOING TO QUIT ON ME. APRIL 25TH, 2014 HAPPENED TO BE THAT DAY. MY CAR IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE LEMON LAW AS I PURCHASED IT LAST JANUARY. FORD IS HESITANT ON HELPING ME AND GETTING MY CAR BACK AND RUNNING. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, THEREFORE, I DID NOT PURSUE THE PROBLEM ANY FURTHER.   *JS",

OUR CAR IS CURRENTLY IN THEIR SERVICE CENTER FOR THE 4TH ATTEMPT TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION. 3 OF THE MASTER MECHANICS, SCOTTY, CARLISLE, AND ANTHONY, SAY THEY HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR MULTIPLE TIMES WITHOUT REPAIRING ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT THEY CANNOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. 5/28/13 THE HESITATION AND NONRESPONSIVE ACCELERATION INCREASED AND WE BROUGHT OUR CAR TO THE SERVICE CENTER AND PAID FOR AN OIL CHANGE. WE WERE GIVEN THE CAR BACK AND TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM FOUND.  6/14/13 WE BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE WAS AN UPDATE FOR THE COMPUTER AND WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FIXED. 12/9/13 WE CAME BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT THIS TIME THE CAR SHUT OFF WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING ON THE NYS THRUWAY AND THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON WHEN I DROPPED IT OFF. AGAIN THE CAR WAS GIVEN BACK AND WE WERE TOLD NO PROBLEM FOUND. THEY SAID THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON. IT HAD BEEN ON FOR TWO DAYS PRIOR. 12/18/13 WE BROUGHT OUR CAR BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTER. AFTER WE CALLED FORD CORPORATE FOR HELP, THE SERVICE MANAGER, DANIELLE GOT INVOLVED. THE GAS MILEAGE DROPPED AT THIS TIME FROM 32-27 MILES/GALLON COMBINED.  OUR CAR WAS AT BREWSTER FORDS SERVICE CENTER FOR OVER 30 DAYS WITHOUT BEING CONTACTED ONCE. WHEN MY HUSBAND CALLED TO CHECK ON THE STATUS, HE WAS TOLD THEY WERE WAITING ON A SERVICE ENGINEER TO COME OUT. AFTER SPEAKING TO ANGELA, THE REGIONAL MANAGER FROM FORD, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE SERVICE CENTER IS UNABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM AND WE SHOULD AGAIN TAKE OUR UNSAFE CAR.  1/23/14 TODAY THE REGIONAL MANAGER AGREED TO APPROVE A SECOND OPINION.",

WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS, MY CAR WAS 'SHUDDERING' FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION WHEN ACCELERATING; THE RPM'S GO UP SPORADICALLY TO, REVVING THE ENGINE HIGHER THAN IT NEEDS TO GO. IT FEELS ALMOST LIKE IT'S GOING TO DIE AND THEN WILL CATCH THE GEAR AND GO. I HAVE TAKEN MY CURRENT CAR IN FOR SERVICE ONCE FOR ANOTHER UPDATE, BUT MY 2011 WAS IN THE SHOP MULTIPLE TIMES TO FIX THIS ISSUE, AND ALWAYS CAME BACK TO ME DOING THE SAME 'SHUDDERING' AS IT DID BEFORE IT WENT IN. I CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD TALK TO MY DEALER AND THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. WELL, BY TAKING CARE OF IT, THEY MEANT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER 'UPDATE'. I HAD IT UPDATED ON 8/26/13 AND I PICKED IT UP ONLY TO FIND THAT THE SHUDDERING IS WORSE. IT'S NOT SAFE TO TRY AND DRIVE A CAR THAT SHUDDERS AND LAGS WHEN YOU HAVE TO CROSS BUSY STREETS AND IN NORMAL DAILY TRAFFIC. I'M TIRED OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE ESPECIALLY BEING THAT I BOUGHT A NEW CAR. AND AN AMERICAN CAR AT THAT.

IF THIS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC I MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIT. I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH ALSO PUT ME AT A HIGHER RISK OF GETTING HIT BY A CAR, OR SLIPPING AND FALLING, OR GETTING FROST BITE. IF I HAD THE OPTION OF TURNING OFF THE TRACTION CONTROL I COULD HAVE GOTTEN MYSELF OUT OF THE SNOW AND CONTINUED ON MY WAY SAFELY. CONVERSELY, IF I DID NOT HAVE THE TRACTION CONTROL ON IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN STUCK. THIS BROUGHT TO MIND A FEW CRITICAL QUESTIONS: 1. WHAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED IN A MORE REMOTE AREA AND I HAD BEEN STRANDED IN FREEZING WEATHER WITHOUT HELP; AND 2. WHAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED IN A MORE CONGESTED ROADWAY AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HIT DUE TO THE RANDOM OPERATION OF THE TRACTION CONTROL WITHOUT A WAY TO DISABLE THE FEATURE. BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT I FEEL UNSAFE WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL ON, SO I HAVE DISABLED IT. TO DO SO I HAD TO PULL THE FUSE, WHICH ALSO DISABLED THE ABS. I HAVE DRIVEN FOR OVER HALF OF MY DRIVING CAREER WITHOUT ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL HAS NEVER BENEFITED ME, EVEN WHEN I NEEDED THE FEATURES.

THIS ALSO HAPPENED AT 15 MPH GOING AROUND A TURN FOR 4 SECONDS BEFORE POWER TO THE WHEELS RESUMED.  DURING THESE TWO OCCURRENCES THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING AND BEHAVING AS IF THE CAR WAS IN NEUTRAL.  - AFTER BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND IT MOVED FORWARD AS EXPECTED ABOUT 2 FEET AND THEN THE TRANSMISSION DISENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN ROLLING BACKWARDS.  THE TRANSMISSIONS WOULD NOT ENGAGE UNTIL 4 ATTEMPTS OF PUTTING THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND STOPPING AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE.  - ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE TRANSMISSION WOULD RAPIDLY SHIFT UP AND DOWN WHILE MOVING FORWARD BETWEEN 5 AND 40 MILES PER HOUR.  BY RAPIDLY, I MEAN IT WAS SHIFTING IN AND OUT OF GEARS AT A RATE OF ABOUT 4 SHIFTS PER SECOND.  THIS RESULTED IN ERRATIC SPEED AT CONGESTED INTERSECTIONS AS WELL AS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY AND REGULAR ROADS.  - ON 2 OCCASIONS THE VEHICLE FAILED TO START AT ALL. THIS IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED ISSUES BECAUSE THE CAR WAS CONFUSED AND THOUGHT IT WAS IN GEAR.  - SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR  WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO LAG AND THEN LURCH.  - 1ST GEAR WAS MUSHY WHEN TAKING OFF THEN WOULD SUDDENLY LURCH.    THESE ARE SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS.  THE DEALERSHIP FOUND FLUID ON THE CLUTCH PADS AND MOST LIKELY ALSO CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE SENSORS IN THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.  FULL CLUTCH ASSEMBLY AND SHAFT SEAL REPLACEMENT IS BEING PERFORMED BY DEALER.    VEHICLE IS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD WITH ABOUT 4K MILES.  *TR",

WHILE TURNING INTO A PARKING LOT, GOING APPROXIMATELY 5MPH, THE VEHICLE ABRUPTLY LOST POWER, THE \"STOP SAFELY NOW\" WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, AND I COASTED THE CAR TO A HALT AT THE SIDE OF THE LOT ENTRANCE.  NO OTHER WARNING LIGHTS ILLUMINATED.  ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS INOPERABLE, IT ALSO COULD NOT BE TURNED OFF.  USUALLY, PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON TO TURN THE CAR OFF DISCONNECTS THE HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY FROM THE REST OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND SHUTS THE CAR DOWN, BUT IN THIS SITUATION IT WOULD JUST CAUSE THE WARNING BELL AND \"STOP SAFELY NOW\" LIGHT TO POP UP AGAIN IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  AFTER MAYBE 45 MINUTES, RIGHT AS THE TOW-TRUCK DRIVER ARRIVED, I WAS SUDDENLY ABLE TO TURN THE CAR OFF BY PRESSING THE BUTTON.  IT THEN FUNCTIONED NORMALLY WHEN TURNED BACK ON.     LUCKILY I WAS IN A REASONABLY SAFE SITUATION WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  HOWEVER, MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS EXIST FOR THE FOCUS ELECTRIC (MANY MORE IN PUBLIC FORUMS THAN HERE), AND THE FAILURE HAS OCCURRED ON THE HIGHWAY AND IN TRAFFIC FOR SOME PEOPLE.

I NOW HAVE OVER 10K MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS SINCE TOLD ME THAT THE ROUGH IDLE IN PARK OR IN GEAR WITH BRAKE APPLIED IS THE RESULT OF THE \"DIRECT INJECTION\" TECHNOLOGY USED IN THIS VEHICLE.  THE HESITATION EXPERIENCED DURING 0 TO >0 ACCELERATION (GRADUAL OR HARD) IS ALSO THE RESULT OF THE \"DIRECT INJECTION\" TECHNOLOGY COUPLED WITH ELECTRONIC CLUTCH TECHNOLOGY USED IN PLACE OF A TORQUE CONVERTER.  THIS COMBINATION HAS YIELDED NUMEROUS \"ALMOST STALLED\" CONDITIONS DURING NORMAL DRIVING MANEUVERS INCLUDING ACCELERATION DURING THE COMPLETION OF A LEFT TURN CROSSING ONCOMING LANES OF TRAFFIC. I RAISE THIS CONCERN AS I UNDERSTAND THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OF F150 VEHICLES WITH \"DIRECT INJECTION\" TECHNOLOGY AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR THE LOSS OF POWER.  MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE FORD FOCUS HAS NOT RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT.  MY GOAL IS TO RAISE AWARENESS TO A SIMILAR CONDITION FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER UTILIZING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY.

NO OFFER FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE TIRES, NO CREDIT FOR THE SUMMER TIRES TOWARDS PURCHASE OF ALL SEASON TIRES, OR MOUNT & BALANCE OF TIRES I COULD PURCHASE.
