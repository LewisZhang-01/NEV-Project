(I THOUGHT I'D RAN OVER SOMETHING SO I GOT OUT AND CHECKED). AFTER ABOUT ANOTHER DAY I HEARD THE SOUND AGAIN, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOTICING MY CAR NOT MOVING FORWARD GIVEN THE APPLIED POWER THAT I WAS PROVIDING. CRAWLED UNDER MY VEHICLE AGAIN WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME ONLY TO FIND NOTHING. AFTER A FEW WEEKS, AND WHILE LEAVING FROM A DEAD STOP UNDER LOAD, OR WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE INTO TRAFFIC THE CAR WAS NOT PULLING PROPERLY CAUSING ME TO NEARLY BECOME REAR ENDED ON SEVERAL (FOUR) OCCASIONS THAT WEEK. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE TRANSFER CASE, AND REPAIRED FOR $2000.00. THE SAME THING IS NOW HAPPENING ONCE AGAIN STARTING IN OCT OF 2014 AND AFTER DOING MY RESEARCH ON CADILLAC FORUMS, GM FORUMS, CADILLAC OWNERS.COM, CAR ID, CARS.COM, JUST ANSWER.CAR, AUTOFRENZY.NET, CARCOMPLAINTS.COM, NHTSA (POWERTRAIN/DRIVETRAIN PROBLEMS), AS WELL AS THIS FORUM SAFERCAR.GOV, I HAVE FOUND WELL OVER 647 COMPLAINTS FOR FAILURE OF THE TRANSFER CASE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA ALONE. THERE WERE NEARLY 73,000 FIRST GEN SRX SOLD WITH AWD, AND FROM ALL OF THE OWNERS THAT I HAVE GATHERED AND FROM ALL THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THEY HAVE ALL HAD SOME PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS SOLELY WITH THE SRX, ITS ALSO WITH THE CTS, AS WELL AS THE STS. THESE $47,000 TO $58,000.00 PLUS DOLLAR VEHICLES ARE A ROAD HAZARD NOT ONLY THEIR DRIVERS, BUT TO ALL THAT SHARE THE ROAD.  THE SRX CASES NEED TO BE RECALLED AND (PERMANENTLY) REPAIRED OR REPLACED.  I ASK ALL OWNERS THAT SPENT THEIR HARD EARNED MONIES ON THESE FLAWED VEHICLES, ONCE AGAIN FROM GM, TO CALL, WRITE, AND E-MAIL OR DO THEM ALL FORUMS, YOUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE NHTSA AND HAVE ALL OF YOUR ATTORNEY'S ON STANDBY.  *TR",

THE WHINE TURNED INTO A MECHANICAL CLUCKING SOUND WHEN THE CAR ACCELERATING FROM A STOP. I RETURNED TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A COMMON SOFTWARE UPDATED THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED (AND CHARGED ME ABOUT $250). WHEN I PICKED IT UP, PULLING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT, THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE. I ASKED FOR A REFUND OR FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY FIX THE ISSUE. I WAS TOLD TO RETURN WHEN MY SERVICE REP WAS IN. THE NEXT DAY THE DEALER WAS SHUT DOWN BY GM. I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE DETAILS DON'T DIRECTLY TO THE ISSUE (WHICH I WILL FURTHER EXPLAIN), BUT SEEMS TO BE A SYMPTOM OF HOW THE GM DEALERS HANDLE ISSUES. TODAY I TOOK IT TO ONE OF TWO REMAINING GM SHOPS IN TOWN. THEY NEEDED TO PERFORM A $200 FLUID EXCHANGE ON THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS THE ISSUE. THEN CALLED ME BACK, SAYING THERE WAS NO 100K MILE WARRANTY ON THE CAR AND THE REPLACEMENT WOULD BE ABOUT $1300, ALONG WITH THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT \"SHOULD BE DONE\" PUTTING THE TOTAL TO OVER $2500. ON A CAR THAT NOW HAS JUST OVER 70K MILES AND IS NOT QUITE FIVE YEARS OLD. HAD I NOT SEEN SO MANY OTHER OWNERS WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUES WITH THE MODEL, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A RARE OCCURRENCE. BUT GIVEN THE BEVY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SAME THING HAPPENING, THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE A GLARING DESIGN DEFECT. I APPRECIATE THERE IS A PLACE TO COMPILE THESE COMPLAINTS. MAYBE ACTION CAN BE TAKEN TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE.  THANK YOU *TR",
