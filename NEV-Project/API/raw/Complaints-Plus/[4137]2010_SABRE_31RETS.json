        "summary": "I PURCHASED A NEW 2010 SABRE FIFTH WHEEL TRAILER ON 11/03/09. IT CAME EQUIPPED WITH DURO ST 225/75R15  TIRES. ON MY VERY FIRST TRIP I HAD A BLOWOUT. I RETURNED THE TIRE TO THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER   REPLACED IT. ON 8/4/11 I HAD ANOTHER BLOWOUT AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 MONTHS OF TRAILER USE. AGAIN, THE MANUFACTURER REPLACED THE TIRE. IN JUNE, 2012 I HAD THE THIRD BLOWOUT. THIS TIME THE DEALER TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRE AND THAT IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY.  I RETURNED HOME AND INSPECTED THE TIRE IN DETAIL. THIS IS WHEN I DISCOVERED THE TIRE WAS MANUFACTURED IN THE FIFTH WEEK OF 2003. I IMMEDIATELY INSPECTED THE REMAINING ORIGINAL DURO TIRE ON MY TRAILER, AND REALIZED IT ALSO WAS MANUFACTURED THE FIFTH WEEK OF 2003. I THEN LOOKED AT THE DURO SPARE TIRE AND IT WAS STAMPED 0506. THUS, THE TRAILER MANUFACTURER, FORREST RIVER, HAD INSTALLED DURO TIRES THAT WERE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS OLD ON A TRAILER THEY TOLD ME CAME OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE ON 11/11/09. THE REASON I WAS HAVING SO MANY BLOWOUTS WAS BECAUSE THE TIRES WERE SO OLD THE RUBBER WAS DETERIORATING. THESE BLOWOUTS WERE EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO ME AND MY FAMILY. FORREST RIVER INTENTIONALLY INSTALLED OLD TIRES ON A TRAILER DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS. IT APPEARS FORREST RIVER IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING A HIGHER PROFIT ON THE SALE OF THEIR TRAILER THAN THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.  *TR",
