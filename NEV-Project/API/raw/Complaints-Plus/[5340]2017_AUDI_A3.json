IT WAS IN AUGUST OF 2017, WHEN AUDI FINALLY ADMITTED TO ME, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WINDSHIELD. THEIR SOLUTION WAS TO PUT SOME \"FILM\" ON THE WINDSHEILD\"    IN MY VIEW, THERE SHOULD BE A MAJOR RECALL ON ALL 2017 AUDI A3 FOR WINDSHEILD REPLACEMENT.  DOES ANYONE KNOW, HOW MANY ACCIDENTS WERE CAUSED IN THIS VEHICLE DUE TO POOR VISIBILTY?  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER.    I TRULY BELEIVE THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  ALSO, IF A \"FILM\" IS APPLIED WILL THAT COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE WINDSHEILD IN THE FUTURE?  WHTA IF THE FILM WEARS OFF, ETC.   MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED, THE DEALER SAYS ROAD DEBRIS CAUSED IT.",

OUR PERMANENT EVSE IN OUR GARAGE IS A HIGHER AMPERAGE RATED EVSE AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THIS LIMITATION.  HERE IS AUDI'S REPLY TO MY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THIS DEFICIENCY IN THEIR PORTABLE EVSE:  \"IT APPEARS THE CREATORS OF THE EVSE CHARGER ARE CONSIDERED A TRADE SECRET AND WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.  THE PORTABLE CHARGER OPERATING TEMPERATURE IS ONLY UP TO 95, AS IT HAS NO VENTING OR COOLING UNLIKE LARGER UNITS.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT WEATHER TEMPERATURES OFTEN EXCEEDS THE LIMIT IN CALIFORNIA, YOU ARE WELCOMED TO PURCHASE A DIFFERENT CHARGING SOLUTION THAT CAN SUPPORT YOUR ENVIRONMENT.\"    SO, I AM WELCOME TO PURCHASE MY OWN PORTABLE EVSE, BECAUSE THE ONE PROVIDED WHEN I PURCHASED MY AUDI BRAND NEW IN FEB. 2017 IS INADEQUATE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO USE IN MANY PARTS OF THE USA.
