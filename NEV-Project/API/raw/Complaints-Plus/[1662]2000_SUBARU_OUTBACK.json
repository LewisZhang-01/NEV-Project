SO, I CALLED SUBARU OF NA EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND ALSO EXPLAINED THAT WHILE I WAS DOING SOME ON-LINE RESEARCH IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED PROBLEM WITH MANY SUBARU OWNERS AND THEY ARE VERY SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT THE EXACT PROBLEM IS. SUBARU OF NA KNOWS OF NO PROBLEM EVER, I GUESS ADMISSION WOULD MEAN THIS PROBLEM TRULY EXISTS.

THE VEHICLE BECAME UNRELIABLE WHEN IT BEGAN OVERHEATING WITH OUR CHILDREN AT THE WHEEL, NOT ONCE BUT TWICE.  THE FIRST INSTANCE WAS IN THE DAYLIGHT HOURS AND WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE IT RIGHT INTO A SUBARU DEALERSHIP.  THE SECOND INSTANCE WAS THE CAR OVERHEATED WITH MY CHILD AT THE WHEEL ON A DARK ROAD IN RURAL SE WASHINGTON AT NIGHT.  THANK GOODNESS SHE DID HAVE A CELL PHONE AND COULD CALL US FOR HELP.  TWO DIFFERENT AUTHORIZED DEALERSHIPS, LOOKED AT THIS PROBLEM THREE TIMES AND DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  NOW AFTER REPLACING THE HEAD GASKETS  AT A LOCAL VEHICLE REPAIR SHOP AND THEN THE ENGINE, YEP, THE ENGINE DUE TO OIL AND WATER LEAKAGE, BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEALERSHIPS THAT MISDIAGNOSED THIS PROBLEM.  NOW AS I SEARCH FOR WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY, I FIND WEBSITES THAT DOCUMENT HUNDREDS OF SUBARU OWNERS WITH THE IDENTICAL STORY AS MINE.  OVERHEATING PROBLEMS, DEALERSHIP NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM PROPERLY AND THEN ENDING UP WITH HEAD GASKET AND FOR SOME OF US ENGINE REPLACEMENT.  PLEASE, PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.  THE WEBSITES ARE ALMOST ENDLESS ON THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT LIKE BEING ANGRY OVER THIS ISSUE.  I JUST WANT SUBARU TO FIX WHAT IS  WRONG, AND TO HELP ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS GET SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR WHAT WE HAVE HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET, NOTHING ELSE.

LITTLE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THERE WAS ENOUGH COOLANT IN THE CAR, ETC).  WAS HAVING A STRONG BURNING ODOR FROM MY CAR FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO.  GOT THE CAR INTO A MECHANIC TODAY WHO SPECIALIZES IN SUBARU AUTOMOBILES.  I FOUND THAT I HAD A CRACKED HEAD GASKET THAT WAS LEAKING OIL EXTERNALLY.      UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT SUBARU SEEMS TO HAVE, WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE, A DEFECTIVE GASKET IN THEIR AUTOMOBILES WITH THE 2.5L ENGINES.  I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA TO SEE IF THEY WILL HELP REIMBURSE MY COST OF REPAIR.  MY CAR IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS ABOUT 45,000 MILES ON IT!!  IN MY OPINION, I BELIEVE THAT SUBARU IS CLAIMING THAT THEY CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM BY RECALLING THE CARS AND RUNNING A SEALANT THROUGH THE COOLANT SYSTEM.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A BAD COVER-UP.  COULD YOU IMAGINE IF SUBARU HAD TO RECALL THOUSANDS OF CARS TO REPLACE A DEFECTIVE PART LIKE A GASKET?  THEIR INCOMPETENT DEALERSHIPS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT!  PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN.
