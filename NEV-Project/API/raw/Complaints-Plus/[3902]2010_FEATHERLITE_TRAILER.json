        "summary": "PURCHASED A HORSE TRAILER, BRAND NEW, EARLY 2010.  CAME EQUIPPED WITH 5 CARLISLE RADIAL TRAILER TIRES (1 SPARE).  TWO OF THE TIRES HAVE BEEN LOST TO PLY SEPARATION.  A THIRD SHREDDED ON THE ROAD, SO I CANNOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT IT SEPARATED ALSO, BUT WOULD BET THAT WAS THE CASE.  CARLISLE DID REPLACE ONE OF THE TIRES FOR ME UNDER WARRANTY IN JUNE 2012, ALTHOUGH THE WARRANTY WAS OUT BY A FEW MONTHS.  ON JULY 22, 2102, THE THIRD TIRE WENT BAD.  TIRES WERE ALL PROPERLY INFLATED AND MY TRAILER WAS NOT OVERLOADED.  I STILL HAVE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL INSTALLED TIRES ON THE TRAILER THAT I AM SURE WILL FAIL SOON.  MY TRAILER IS NOT LISTED AS AN OPTION UNDER THE VEHICLE SECTION, SO HERE IS THE INFORMATION:   2010 KEIFER BUILT EVOLUTION 793;  GVWR 14,000.  ALL FAILURES OCCURRED WITH APPROXIMATELY 10,500 POUNDS.  TOW VEHICLE WAS 2002 DODGE 2500 DIESEL TRUCK.  I ONLY SELECTED FEATHERLITE BECAUSE IT IS A HORSE TRAILER.  I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS COMPLAINT AND WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. *TR",
