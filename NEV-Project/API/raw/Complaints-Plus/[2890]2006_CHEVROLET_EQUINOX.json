I HAVE HAD BRAKES AND BRAKE PEDAL ISSUES FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW IN BOTH CITY AND HIGHWAY DRIVING. THE ISSUES OCCUR AT ATTEMPTING TO STOP AT STOP SIGNS AND STOP LIGHTS. THIS IS THE FIRST OF ANY MAJOR ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE. MY ISSUES ARE BREAK RESISTANCE AND VIBRATIONS. ALONG WITH GETTING MY BRAKES AND ROTORS FIXED AND/OR CHANGED EARLIER IN THE YEAR, I STARTED FEELING BRAKE VIBRATIONS INITIALLY. AFTER GETTING THE ROTORS CHECKED, IT HAPPENED SOON AFTER AND \"GRADUATED\" TOWARDS A RESISTANCE WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO STOP OR SLOW DOWN UNLESS I PUMPED MY BREAKS REPEATEDLY TO RELEASE THE PEDAL LOCKING. I RECENTLY GOT MY LEFT FRONT SPEED SENSOR AND HUB ASSEMBLY REPLACED IN HOPES IT WOULD FIX THE ISSUE. 3-4 WEEKS LATER, THE RESISTANCES HAS SEEM TO GOT A LOT STRONGER/BIGGER. IT HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME SEVERAL ACCIDENTS AT THE STOP LIGHT AND I AM NOW TRYING TO SAVE TO GET THIS ISSUE FIXED AS I WAS QUOTED ABOUT $2K INITIALLY. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO ANY VEHICLE AND EQUINOX THAT HAS THIS ISSUE. I HAVE SAVED MYSELF FROM SEVERAL ACCIDENTS WITH QUICK AWARENESS AND ACTION AND BUT I AM NOT SURE HOW LUCKY OTHERS HAVE BEEN. THE RESISTANCE IN THE BREAKS AND VIBRATION IS VERY NOTICEABLE AND CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENS UNTIL THE ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL LIGHTS UP ON THE DASH BOARD INDICATING THEY ARE DEACTIVATED/DISABLED. THIS IS WHEN BRAKING BECOMES MUCH EASIER WITH LITTLE TO NO RESISTANCE AND VIBRATING. BETWEEN THE SPEED SENSOR, HUB ASSEMBLY, I HAVE SPENT JUST OVER $1K IN EXPENSES AND THIS WILL CONTINUE TO RISE WITH THE NEXT REPAIR OF WIRE HARNESS AND/OR REPLACEMENT OF ABS SYSTEM IN HOPES IT CORRECTS THE ISSUE.

THE ABS AND TC LIGHTS WOULD COME ON INTERMITTENTLY. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC: HE EVALUATED EACH CONNECTION AND CLEANED THEM, WHERE THE ABS HARNESS CONNECTS TO THE MAIN HARNESS. HE FOUND NO DISCREPANCIES. AFTER 2 MORE MONTHS OF DANGEROUS DRIVING, AND A WHOLE NEW SET OF BRAKES (ALL 4), ONLINE RESEARCH PREVAILED ONCE AGAIN.

BUT WHILE  IN MY ACCOUNT IT WAS SHOWING ACTIVE WARRANTY.  IT SHOWED ME THERE WAS AN ACTIVE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM GM, COVERING ACTUATOR DOOR DEFAULT. ALL EQUINOX OWNERS ARE COVERED TO 120,000 MILES OR 1/1/2016.....SO IF YOU HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH HEAT BLOWING COLD TAKE IT TO AUTHORIZED CHEVY GM DEALER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE DASH OUT TO FIX A 10.00 PART, THE LABOR CHARGE IS $2600 MY DEALER TOLD ME. ALSO IF YOU PAID FOR THIS ISSUE OUT OF POCKET THEY WILL REIMBURSE YOU. GOOGLE THIS ISSUE , THERE IS A SPECIAL BULLETIN NUMBER FOR THIS. GET THAT NUMBER AND CALL YOUR DEALER!!!!! THEY WON'T TELL YOU IT'S COVERED AND CHARGE YOU BECAUSE MOST OF THE SERVICE MANAGERS DON'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTS. NOW THAT'S NOT RITE.....THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS BEING COVERED, IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER.  *TR",

GM HAS ADMITTED A DESIGN FLAW IN THE HVAC BLEND DOOR ACTUATOR IN THAT A DEALER REPLACEMENT USES AN UPDATED HVAC BLEND DOOR ACTUATOR WHICH MORE ACCURATELY LIMITS THE ROTATIONAL TRAVEL. THE FAILURE OF THE HVAC BLEND DOOR OCCURS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL FAULTY DESIGNED HVAC BLEND DOOR ACTUATOR TRAVELS TOO FAR CAUSING STRUCTURAL STRESS ON THE BLEND DOOR WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE BLEND DOOR.

ON MARCH 6, 2013 WHILE PRESSING BRAKES THEY JAMMED, AND HAD TO PULL VEHICLE OFF ROAD NOT TO HIT VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  ON MARCH 7, 2013 TOOK VEHICLE BACK TO DAN VANDEN DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID THEY REPLACED THE LEFT FRONT HUB ASSEMBLY FOR A CHARGE OF 593.28 (LABOR AND OTHER FEES).  WHEN I PICKED THE VEHICLE UP THAT EVENING AND DROVE 1/2 MILE THE ABS AND TRACKING LIGHT CAME BACK ON WHILE DRIVING. DROVE VEHICLE BACK TO DEALERSHIP.  I WAS GIVEN A COURTESY VEHICLE FOR A WEEK UNTIL THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.  IT IS NOW JUNE AND I AM EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM OF THE ABS AND TC LIGHT COMING ON, AND BRAKES JAMMING.  I HAVE ALSO SEEN ALOT OF COMPLAINTS ON GOOGLE REGARDING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE SAME VEHICLE. WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED.  *TR",

HE SAID IT WOULD COST AROUND $1,000 TO REPAIR.  THIS WAS A SHOCK BECAUSE MY MECHANIC IS VERY REPUTABLE; I HAVE USED HIM FOR YEARS.  HE NEVER TRIES TO CHEAT ME OR ANY OF HIS OTHER CUSTOMERS.  WHEN HE QUOTED ME THAT PRICE, THAT'S WHEN I KNEW SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH MY CAR.  I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY - I'M A SINGLE MOTHER OF 2 KIDS AND I WAS LAID OFF FROM MY JOB A FEW MONTHS AGO.         I CALLED CHEVROLET 3 TIMES AND NOBODY WOULD HELP ME.  IN THE MEANTIME, I DID SOME RESEARCH TO SEE IF ANY OTHER CONSUMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME PROBLEM.  I FOUND OVER 600 COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER DRIVERS ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE.  I TOOK MY CAR TO A MECHANIC AGAIN AND WAS ADVISED THAT CHEVY/GM HASN'T ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM (CAR HEATER BLOWING COLD AIR) BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR CHEVY TO FIX IT.  THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT CHEVY/GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT AND, FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, THE PROBLEM EXISTS IN CHEVY EQUINOX'S FROM ALL DIFFERENT MODEL YEARS.        NOT ONLY WILL I NEVER BUY A CHEVY AGAIN, I AM FILING A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST CHEVY/GM FOR FAILING TO ISSUE A RECALL TO FIX A KNOWN PROBLEM. EVEN IF I DID HAVE THE MONEY, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR SOMETHING THAT THIS COMPANY KNOWS IS A PROBLEM.  *TR",

I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL.  THIS IS A SAFTEY CONCER BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE NO DEFROST.  THE LACK OF HEAT IS CAUSED BY THE AIR TEMPERATURE BLEND DOOR FAILING TO OPERATE.  THE BLEND DOOR ALLOWS AIR TO FLOW PAST THE HEATER CORE.  THE AIR TEMPERATURE DOOR HAS A PLASTIC ARM WHICH IS CONNECTED TO AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.  IT SEEMS THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS PLASTIC ARM BREAKING AND MOTOR MALFUNCTION.  GM DEALERS REPLACE THE PLASTIC ARM WITH A METAL ARM AT A COST TO THE CONSUMER OF BETWEEN $1100 AND $1400 DOLLARS.  THIS IS A MANUFACTURES PART PROBLEM.  GM SHOULD STEP UP AND MAKE THIS PROBLEM A RECALL ISSUE.  SAFTEY IS INVOLVED.  THE NEWER MODELS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM.  *TT",

ONE DAY THE AC AND HEAT WERE WORKING FINE, THE NEXT DAY THE HEATER WOULD ONLY BLOW COLD AIR...NO HEAT AS WELL AS A NON-WORKING WINDOW DEFROSTER. THIS BEGAN IN EARLY NOVEMBER. THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THE ACTUATOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE TEMPERATURE DOOR (BLEND DOOR). COST IS $100 FOR THE ANALYSIS AND ABOUT $1,000 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. I HAVE A SECURENET EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT THEY SAY THIS IS NOT COVERED. CAR IS AT DEALERSHIP NOW AWAITING MY APPROVAL TO DO THE WORK. I AM IN LIMBO AND LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SHOP WHO CAN MAYBE FIX IT CHEAPER. CONSIDERING THE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS I HAVE SEEN ONLINE ABOUT THIS, AND THE FACT THE PARTS WERE CHEAP AND SHOULD NOT BE BREAKING SO SOON, THIS NEEDS TO BE RECALLED!  *TR",

THE DOOR USED TO HAVE A METAL TAB THAT CONNECTED TO THE BLEND DOOR ACTUATOR. STARTING WITH THE 2005 MODELS, GM USED A PLASTIC TAB.

THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A PLASTIC AIR BLEND DOOR (PART# CH19130554) THAT IS CONTROLLED BY AN ELECTRIC ACTUATOR (PART# CH15781467).  THE ACTUATOR IS NOT CALIBRATED APPROPRIATELY AND PLACES EXCESSIVE STRESS ON THE PLASTIC AIR BLEND DOOR CONNECTION.

IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER WE CANNOT DEFROST OUR WINDOWS!! THIS BECOMES A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PEOPLE OUT ON THE ROAD DRIVING WITH IMPAIRED VISION DUE TO FOGGY, SNOW COVERED, OR ICE COVERED WINDOWS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS.  GM SHOULD DEFINITELY RECALL THIS VEHICLE FOR THIS REASON ALONE WHICH IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE!!  WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDS?
