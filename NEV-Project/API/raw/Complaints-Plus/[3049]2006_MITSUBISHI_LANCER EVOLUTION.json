IN FACT, I EVEN FOUND A YOUTUBE CLIP OF THE EXACT SAME NOISE CREATED FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  THE NOISE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE INVOLVING THE TIMING BELT RUBBING AGAINST THE CRANKSHAFT BLADE.  I'VE ONLY FOUND IT TO ONLY BE AUDIBLE AT IDLE, SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT'S SOME SORT OF TIMING BELT TENSION ISSUE.  SOME DEALERSHIPS ARE RESOLVING THIS ISSUE BY REPLACING THE TIMING BELT, CRANKSHAFT BLADE, TIMING BELT TENSIONER, AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE IDLER PULLEY.  MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP DENIED MY WARRANTY REPAIR CLAIM TO GET THE METAL SCRAPING NOISE ISSUE FIXED, AND CHARGED ME $140 TO SPRAY ENGINE DEGREASER ON UNDRESSED ACCESSORY BELTS, CLAIMING THAT THE ACCESSORY BELTS WERE OVERDRESSED AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE NOISE.  UNFORTUNATELY, MY CAR IS STILL MAKING THE SAME NOISE, WHICH I AM CERTAIN IS BEING CAUSED BY THE SAME TIMING BELT/CRANKSHAFT BLADE ISSUE.  MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT THE TIMING BELT WILL AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE FAIL DUE TO THE OBVIOUS RUBBING/CONTACT THAT IS OCCURRING WITH THE CRANKSHAFT BLADE, SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS FIXED BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.  GLENDALE MITSUBISHI IN GLENDALE, CA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT'S A COMMON ISSUE, BUT WAS NOT WILLING TO DISCUSS IT WITH MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, STATING THAT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP SHOULD CONTACT THE MITSUBISHI TECH LINE INSTEAD.

THE CLUTCH SEEMS TO HAVE WORN OUT FAR TOO SOON; FURTHERMORE SHIFTING IS VERY ROUGH FROM 1ST THROUGH 3RD GEAR AND CAUSES THE CAR TO PULSATE. IT IS AT ITS WORST IN FIRST GEAR. APPARENTLY, THIS QUITE COMMON WITH THE EVO CLASS MUST BE ADDRESSED.      MANY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT THE DEALER IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE ANY CONSIDERATION TO A WORN OUT CLUTCH AND EXPLAINS THAT IT IS A \"WEAR ITEM\" THEREFORE EXEMPTING THEM FROM ANY LIABILITY OF THE MATTER AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE CLUTCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO WEAR OUT, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THEM TO WEAR OUT THIS EARLY WHEN THE OPERATOR DRIVES AT A STANDARDIZED PACE.  THIS IS EVEN EXCLUDING THE FACT THAT THIS IS A HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLE CLAIMING TO WITHSTAND AVERAGE DRIVER ABUSE.    MANY COMPLAINTS FROM LANCER EVOLUTION OWNERS EXIST, AND MANY ARE MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED.  THESE ISSUES CAN CAUSE DEADLY CONSEQUENCES TO ANY DRIVER DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE OPERATOR HAS NO CONTROL OF THE CARS ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. THIS MUST BE ADDRESSED AND BE CAUSE FOR A RECALL ON ALL MITSUBISHI LANCER EVOLUTIONS.

SO I PURCHASED AN AFTERMARKET CLUTCH THAT THE DEALERSHIP INSTALLED AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I PICKED UP THE CAR AND THE CLUTCH WOULD STILL NOT GO INTO 6TH GEAR. I NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP OF THE CONTINUING PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THAT THEIR TECHNICIAN SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE, I TOOK THE CAR THE VERY NEXT DAY AND THE DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED MY CLAIM. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS AND TOLD ME THAT THEY BELIEVE IT WAS A SYNCHRO IN THE TRANSMISSION AND REPLACED IT AFTER A FEW DAYS. A FEW MORE DAYS PASSED AND I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY CAR. THEY TOLD ME THAT MY CLUTCH IS NOW STUCK ON 2ND GEAR AND DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS.
