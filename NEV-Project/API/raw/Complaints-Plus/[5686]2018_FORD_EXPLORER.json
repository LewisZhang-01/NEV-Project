Subsequent dealer inspections located nothing to cause the issues until the third time they inspected it and located the waste gate from the turbo chargers not function due to missing clips/rod. The repair has corrected the issue however i was charged for the repair stating the parts of the turbor charger where not covered under the powertrain warranty even though if gone uncorrected would have caused the turbos to fail under operation causing potential entire engine failure which if occured underway or during acceleration would create a significant safety hazard to the operator, passengers and potential other vehicles on the road.

ON THE 4TH DAY I ENDED UP TAKING THE SUV HOME BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE SMELL COMING INSIDE THE CABIN. SUPERVISOR ASKED ME TO TAKE THE SUV BACK WHEN IT SMELLS TOXIC AGAIN INSIDE THE CABIN. I AM PLANNING TO BRING IT ON MONDAY AND LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL THEY FIX THE ISSUE. MY WHOLE FAMILY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH COUGH AND COLD FOR MORE THAN 1 MONTH NOW, I HAD A FEELING IT WAS RELATED TO THE FUME COMING FROM THE EXHAUST.  FORD CALLED ME AND SAID THE VEHICLE IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR BUYBACK PROG FROM FORD. I WILL STOP USING THIS SUV STARTING TOMORROW SUNDAY 2/17/19 TO SAVE OUR HEALTH.  I WAS TOLD BY FORD SERVICE AGENT THAT THE RECALL HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND THAT 2018 MODELS WERE ALREADY CORRECTED. PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BEFORE MY FAMILY DEVELOP SERIOUS ILLNESS.",

YOU CAN NOT SEE ANY PORTION OF LOW PROFILE CARS IN THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR AND YOU CAN NOT SEE THE HEADLIGHTS OF MOST VEHICLES AT NIGHT.  IT DOES SHOW THE VERY TOP OF TALLER CARS (SUVS/TRUCKS/VANS).   I HAVE PHOTOS TAKEN WHILE DRIVING OF CARS THAT ARE IN THE BLIND SPOT.  AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTOS, YOU CAN SEE ONLY THE VERY TOP OF THE VAN AND ALMOST NONE OF THE STANDARD CAR.  AT NIGHT, THE ROOF OF THE CAR IS NOT AS HELPFUL TO SEE AS THE HEADLIGHTS.  I CHECKED ANOTHER 2018 EXPLORER AT THE DEALERSHIP AND IT HAD THE SAME VIEW IN THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR.   THE FORD SERVICE TECHNICIAN AGREED THAT THE VIEW ON THE 2018 EXPLORER WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE VIEW ON HIS PERSONAL 2016 FORD FUSION.  HOWEVER, SINCE ALL OF THE 2018 EXPLORERS HAD THE SAME VIEW, IT COULD NOT BE FIXED.  OLDER MODELS APPEAR TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS THAT ARE CORRECTLY POSITIONED.  2014 FORD EXPLORER, 2015 FORD TRANSIT, AND 2016 FORD FUSION ALL HAD CORRECTLY POSITIONED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS.  I CAME VERY CLOSE TO SIDE SWIPING A CAR AT NIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY ON THE DAY I PURCHASED THE EXPLORER.  AS I WAS RELYING ON THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AND NO PORTION OF THE CAR COULD BE SEEN.  THANKFULLY, A HORN SAVED US BOTH.",

THE SMELL ALWAYS OCCURS AFTER A GAS FILL UP.  THE GAS TANK IS NEVER OVERFILLED.  IT ALSO HAPPENS WHEN TAKING A SHARP TURN AFTER A STOP SIGN/LIGHT, AND WHEN BRAKING SWIFTLY.  LIVING IN A NORTHERN CLIMATE, THE GAS SMELL GETS TO BE SO BAD, THAT WINDOWS NEED TO PERIODICALLY BE OPENED IN ORDER TO VENT THE VEHICLE OF GAS SMELL.  THIS DOES NOT GO OVER WELL WHEN IT IS ZERO OUTSIDE.  WITH OVER 3500 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, THE GAS SMELL SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY.  IT STARTED TO SMELL ON DAY 1 OF POSSESSION OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE FIRST GAS FILL UP.NOW, THE WHOLE GARAGE SMELLS OF GAS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME (2 HOURS).  WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE ON A COLD MORNING PARKED OUTSIDE, WITH ALL BLOWERS RUNNING FULL, THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR WILL WREAK OF GAS AFTER 5 MINUTES.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A FORD DEALERSHIP THIS WEEK.  THEY SUPPOSEDLY KNOW OF THE PROBLEM.  IT DOES APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CARBON MONOXIDE PROBLEM AS THIS IS GAS FUME SMELLS.",
