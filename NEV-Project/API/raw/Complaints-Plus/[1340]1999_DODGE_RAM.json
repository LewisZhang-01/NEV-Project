I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO ASK HIM WHAT THE (BLANK) DO I PAY FOR THE DODGE DEALERSHIP TO KEEP MY VEHICLE MAINTAINED, WHICH I NEVER KNEW YOU HAD TO MAINTAIN A HOOD LATCH? EVEN SO THE SECONDARY LATCH WAS THE ISSUE THAT NEVER HELD EVEN IF THE PRIMARY LATCH FAILED. I TALKED TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE STUNNED AT THIS, THEY SAID IT WAS OBVIOUS THE SECONDARY HOOD LATCH FAILED AND ONCE RECALLED ALWAYS RECALLED. I WENT AS FAR AS SAYING THEY DID NOT HAVE TO DO THE $2500.00 WORTH OF REPAIRS (ESTIMATED BY THE DODGE DEALERSHIP) I JUST WANTED THE LATCH TO WORK SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT DOING IT AGAIN AND TO FIX THE SPRINGS SO I DO NOT HAVE TO BE A BODY BUILDER TO OPEN AND SHUT MY HOOD AND TO BEND BACK THE METAL AND TOUCH UP THE PAINT SO IT DON'T RUST.

PIECES HAVE FALLEN INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE DASH AMONG THE WIRING AND DUCTS LEAVING LARGE HOLES ON TOP. THE BRITTLE PLASTIC EDGES ARE VERY SHARP AND LEAVE THE SURFACE UNEVEN AND WEAKENED.

THESE VENDORS ALSO CARRY A MOULDED ABS PLASTIC \"DASH CAP AND BEZEL\" OVERLAYS TO BE GLUED OVER DAMAGED DASHES TO \"IMPROVE APPEARANCE\", (~$300.), A QUICK DYI JOB, BUT WILL NOT SOLVE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS NOR CONTINUED BREAKAGE OF ORIGINAL DASH FROM BELOW CAP, ADDITIONALLY THESE OVERLAY \"CAPS\" DO NOT HAVE THE ATTACHMENT TABS FOR AIRBAG OR INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, ETC., SO THE ORIGINAL TABS WOULD HAVE TO DO THE JOB BUT MAY BE STRUCTURALLY COMPROMISED FROM CRACKING ALSO.     I HAVE YET TO DECIDE WHICH IS THE BEST OPTION TO TAKE. IN ANY CASE, THE OLD PART IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR THE TIME BEING. *TR",

DASH IS NOT SAFE WITH CRACKED, JAGGED PLASTIC EDGES WAITING TO IMPALE OR SLICE YOU, ASSUMING THAT FLYING PEICES WOULDNT DO EVEN MORE HARM IF AIRBAG HAD GONE OFF.  SAME PROBLEM IN DASH ON TWO PERSONAL VEHICLES,  NOW RELUCTANT TO GO ANYWHERE IN ONE THAT WASNT WRECKED BECAUSE AIRBAG PROBABLY WONT WORK IN IT EITHER IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN.  I KNOW MINE ISNT THE ONLY ONE, WHOVER HAS CONTROLLING INTEREST OF DODGE THIS MONTH NEEDS TO STEP UP AND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.  RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF REPLACING DASH FOR $800 - 1200 WITH A PART OF NO BETTER INTEGRITY  THAN THE ONE IT ALREADY HAD. MORE RIDICULOUS IS THE FACT THEY KNOW THE AIRBAGS FAILURES ARE AN ISSUE ON THESE TRUCKS FOR YEARS NOW AND HAVE DONE NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM.  IT SHOULDNT BE UP TO THE CUSTOMER TO WORRY ABOUT THESE TWO CRITICAL SAFETY ITEMS .

MOST RECENTLY THIS TRUCK FAILED THE NEW YOUR STATE INSPECTION FOR WOBBLE IN THE STEERING BOX OUTPUT SHAFT. THIS STEERING BOX WAS REPLACED BY THE DEALER ABOUT 9600 MILES BEFORE. THE TRUCK HAD A LOT OF PLAY IN THE STEERING AND THE WHEEL WAS AT ABOUT 1:30 INSTEAD OF 12:00. THREE MECHANICS AND MYSELF SAW THE PLAY. THIS GARAGE TOLD ME TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER AS IT WOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY. I DID THIS AND HAD TO LEAVE THE TRUCK FOR THEM TO CHECK.I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THERE WAS NO PLAY AND NO REPAIRS WERE NEEDED.THE TRUCK WHEEL WAS NOW AT12: 00 AND IT WAS HARD TO STEER WITH NO RETURN TO CENTER. I TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STEERING BOX AND THAT THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT TO THE ALLIGNMENT WAS TOE IN SO HE SAID THAT MY TRUCK HAD DERVELOPED MEMORY STEERING AND THAT THE STEERING WAS REALLY TIGHT AND THAT I SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN. NOT SATISFIED AS I HAD SEEN THE PLAY MYSELF I REPLACED THE STEERING BOX AND LO AND BEHOLD THE STEERING WAS LIKE NEW. EASY RETURNS TO CENTER AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS CENTERED. WHAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE DEFFECTIVE STEERING BOX WAS THAT THE OVER CENTER ADJUSTMENT WAS 1 TURN TOO TIGHT AND THAT THE WORM SHAFT PRELOAD WAS TOO TIGHT AND THE PITMAN ARM SEALS WERE REPLACED WITH NEW SEALS AND THEY USED CHASSIS LUBE WHICH WAS NEW AND CLEAN.ALL THIS WHILE SAYING THAT THERE WERE NO REPAIRS NEEDED OR DONE. THE PITMAN SHAFT BEARING WAS WORN BETWEEN .045 AND.057 THE NEW SEALS TOOK UP THE PLAY. MY QUESTION WOULD BE IF NEMER DODGE SERVICE DOES THIS KIND OF REPAIR AND SAYS THAT THEY DID NOTHING TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO PAY FOR WARRANTY WORK WHAT ELSE ARE THEY DOING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MY SON ,AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER AS HE IS JUST NOW GETTING HIS LISCENCE, COULD NOT KEEP THIS TRUCK ON THE ROAD. HE NEEDED TO USE TWO LANES TO DRIVE. *AK",

THE DRIVING LIGHTS, LOW AND HIGH BEAMS JUST WENT OUT. I HAVE A 23 MILE COMMUTE ONE WAY. WORKING AT NIGHT I WAS PLACED IN A BAD SITUATION. THE ONLY THING I HAD WAS MY PARKING LIGHTS AND FLASHERS.  I  PULLED OVER AND WAITED FOR THE STATE POLICE, SINCE THEY DID NOT COME.  I DROVE TO WORK WITH MY FLASHERS ON. THE GOOD NEWSIS MY LUCK DID NOT RUN OUT I MADE IT TO WORK UNHARMED. IN THE MORNING I DROVE MY TRUCK HOME  AND LOOKED UP THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND FOUND THERE IS NO FUSES IN THIS CIRCUIT.  I SPOKE WITH MY COUSIN WHO ALSO HAS A RAM AND FOUND OUT THAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH 3 SWITCHES.   WOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY HAZARD? IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON A WINDING ROAD AT NIGHT AND THE SAME THING HAD HAPPENED, I WOULD BE REPLACING MY TRUCK AND NOT JUST THE $75.00 DEALER ONLY SWITCH.  I KNOW THEIR ARE A LOT OF THESE TRUCKS OUT THERE AND TO FIND OUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN 4 SWITCHES REPLACED IN JUST 2 TRUCKS. ISN'T THIS A LITTLE HIGH. ALSO, THE DEALER HAS PLENTY OF THIS ON HAND.

I BEGAN BY TAKING IT TO THE DODGE DEALER, WHO SAID THE REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER WOULD CALL ME.  NO ONE EVER CALLED BACK.  SINCE THEN, THE DASH AS LITERALLY FALLEN APART.  THE IMMEDIATE SAFETY ISSUES ARE (1) THE AIR BAG AND ITS ABILITY TO DEPLOY, AND (2) PIECES OF THE DASH FLYING APART AND INTO OCCUPANTS IN THE EVENT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.    I HAVE EMAILED CHRYSLER; AFTER CHRYSLER'S 2ND REPLY, NO ONE WOULD RESPOND VIA EMAIL.    I HAVE CALLED CHRYSLER'S TOLL FREE CUSTOMER SUPPORT PHONE LINE.  I SPOKE WITH A VERY YOUNG AND ADAMANT YOUNG MAN, WHO REFUSED TO BUDGE ON THE REPLY I OBTAINED VIA EMAIL.  HE EVENTUALLY TERMINATED THE CONVERSTATION BY HANGING UP ON ME.    NEITHER PARTY (EMAIL OR TOLL FREE SUPPORT LINE) WERE INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY SEEING DIGITAL PHOTOS OF THE PROBLEM.  THE PHONE SUPPORT REP, WHEN TOLD OF MY SAFETY CONCERNS, SIMPLY RESPONDED THAT IF I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT I SHOULD GO AHEAD AND REPLACE THE DASH MYSELF.  SOME ANSWER!    I DID STOP BY THE DEALER (AGAIN) THIS AFTERNOON AND GAVE ME A PIECE OF THE DASH IN THE ERSTWHILE HOPE THAT THE NEW SERVICE MANAGER WILL BEGIN TO WORK THIS PROBLEM.    PLEASE HELP.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED AND QUITE SURPRISED AT THE TOTAL LACK OF CHRYSLER CUSTOMER CARE.  I CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE THE DASH AT MY EXPENSE (LUCKILY), BUT AM TORN BECAUSE OF CHRYSLER'S REFUSAL TO \"DO THE RIGHT THING\" AND REPLACE THIS UNSAFE DEFECTIVE PART.WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO?IF YOU WANT THE DIGITAL PHOTOS, I CAN SEND THESE AS WELL.*AK",

I  HAD SOME ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS UNDER THE DASH AND IN THE STEERING COLUMN. MY ALIGNMENT SHOP SAYS THEY HAVE REPLACED A LOT OF STEERING BOXES AND THE TRACKER BAR EVEN AT 18,000 MILES. I HAVE CALLED CHRYSLER THEMSELVES AND THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RESULT FROM A BAD PART FROM THE FACTORY. I HAVE DOCUMENTED EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE TO MY TRUCK. I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE PRICE OF A NEW STEERING BOX AND I HAVE FOUND THAT DODGE WANTS OVER $600 AND A PARTS HOUSE IN MY TOWN CAN GET THE SAME DODGE STEERING BOX FOR $205. I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE BOX WHAT EVER THE PRICE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS NEW ENOUGH THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE IT FIXED, TO AT LEAST MAKE A CUSTOMER SOME WHAT HAPPY. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A STEERING BOX GOING OUT AT LESS THEN 100,000 MILES. MY FATHER HAD A 1999 RAM 1500 PICK UP AND WITH LESS THAN 25,000 MILES THE MOTOR LOST 4 QUARTS OF OIL ON OUR WAY TO A OLD CAR SHOW IN MONTANA BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN SO HE DID NOT WORRY ABOUT IT AND SOLD IT AND GOT A NEW 2002 RAM PICK UP AND HE LIKES IT SO FAR, BUT A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A 2002 RAM AND HE IS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH HIS FRONT END ALIGNMENT.

THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRES WERE SHOT, ARE A SAFTEY CONCERN AND SHOULD BE REPLACED. I THEN TOOK THE VAN TO TIRE WAREHOUSE TO GET A SECOND OPION ON THE TIRES. AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT THE TIRES WERE IN VERY BAD CONDITION AND SHOULD BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I CALLED THE GOODYEAR 800 NUMBER TO REQUEST MY RIGHTS AND IN WHAT DIRECTION I SHOULD GO, BUT I WAS ONLY GIVEN THE RUN-AROUND AND SWITCHED BROM OPERATOR TO OPERATOR. MY CONCERN WITH THIS TIRE IS THAT ON THE SIDE OF THE TIRE IT STATES THAT IT HAS A MAX WEIGHT OF 2,293 POUNDS. GIVEN THAT THE VAN IS A HALF TON, AND HAS ADDED AFTER MARKET CONVERSION PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE WEIGHT EXCEEDS THE LIMIT. I ASKED DODGE ABOUT THIS CONCERN, SINCE THEY SELL THE CONVERSION VAN, AND I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TIRES DO NOT MEET THE CURRENT WEIGHT OF THE TOTAL VAN PACKAGE. MY QUESTION IS, ARE THERE OTHER REPORTED INCEDENTS WITH THIS TIRE AND VANS, OR WITH THIS TIRE IN GENEREAL. ALSO, DO I HAVE A LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST EITHER DODGE OR GOODYEAR TO PURSUE IN ORDER TO GET MY TIRES REPLACED BEFORE AN ACCIDENT . I USE THE VAN AS MY PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION AND I TRANSPORT MY TEENAGE KIDS AND SOMETIMES THEIR FRIENDS, ON A DAILY BASIS. THANK YOU FOR ANY COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER.

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS AND LET THE VEHICLE COAST UNTILL THE TORQUE CONVERTER LOCKED AGAIN, ABOUT TWO MILES AND SPEED DROPPED TO 50 MPH.  EVERTHING SEEMED ALRIGHT UNTIL WE TRAVELED ANOTHER 10 MILES DOWN THE ROAD AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN, IT HAPPENED A THIRD TIME ABOUT 10 MORE MILES DOWN THE ROAD.  WE TOWED THE TRAILER EXACTLY 185 MILES  WHEN WE HAD TO STOP FOR GAS, TANK ON EMPTY, AND PUT IN 27.5 GALLONS OF GAS.  I WOULD SAY THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING ALOT. STAYED TWO DAYS AT THE COAST AND TRIED TO DRIVE BACK TO SAN ANTONIO, TRAVELED 30 MILES TO A MILITARY BASE WITH THE ENGINE REVING AND BARELY DOING 50 MPH, LEFT THE TRAILER IN STORAGE, FILLED THE TANK AGAIN, TOOK 8 GALLONS OF GAS, DROVE BACK TO SAN ANTONIO, ANY TIME TRIED TO DO OVER 70 MPH TO PASS SLOWER VEHICLES THE TRANSMISSION WOULD START VIBRATING.  TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEMS, THEY GAVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO ME A WEEK LATER STATING THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  WENT DOWN TO CORPUS CHRISTI ON 14 JUL 2000 TO RETREIVE THE TRAILER, TEMP 92 DEGREES, LEFT THE BASE AND TRAVELED 11 MILES BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION TORQUE CONVERTER UNLOCKED AGAIN. COULD ONLY DO 30 MPH BACK TO THE BASE OR THE TORQUE CONVERTER WOULD UNLOCK.  TOOK IT BACK AGAIN TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID \"THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION\".  ALL THEY DID WAS PUT THE COMPUTER ON IT , THE PAN HAS NOT BEEN DROPPED YET, PRESSURE GAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN PUT ON IT EITHER. THEY WANT ME TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THE TRAILER IS 185 MILES AWAY AND THE VEHICLE CAN NOT TOW IT BACK HERE.  WHAT DO I DO???*AK",

A FENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT PUMPER TRUCK CUT FROM THE CENTER LANE ACROSS THE PASSING LANE (WHICH WE WERE IN) AND TRIED TO GET ONTO THE SHOULDER.  THIS MANEUVER WAS DONE WITHOUT ANY EMERGENCY LIGHTS, SIRENS, TURN SIGNALS, ETC.  WE HAD APPROX. 2 SECONDS TO REACT AND THE DRIVER ONLY HAD TIME TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES.  WE HIT THE RIGHT REAR CORNER OF THE FIRE TRUCK WHERE IT PROTRUDED INTO THE PASSING LANE AT APPROX 50 MPH.  THE DODGE PICKUP WE WERE IN WAS TOTALLED PER SAFECO INSURACE COMPANY.  SEATBELTS SAVED OUR LIVES, BUT WE WERE INJURED MUCH WORSE THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE AIRBAGS HAD GONE OFF.  NEITHER AIRBAG DEPLOYED DURING THE ACCIDENT.  THE AIRBAGS REMAINED UNDEPLOYED UP UNTIL THE VEHICLE WAS LAST SEEN ON 1-13-2000.  DODGE CLEARLY MADE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT IF A CRASH OF THIS MAGNITUDE DID NOT SET OFF EITHER AIRBAG.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE DODGE, AND CAN E-MAILTHEM IF REQUESTED.  THE AMBULANCE REPORT ALSO DOCUMENTS THE NON-DEPLOYMENT.  THIS NEEDS LOOKED INTO.  THE ODDS OF EVEN  ONE AIRBAG NOT GOING OFF IN A CRASH THIS HARD MUST BE ASTRONOMICAL, BUT FOR BOTH TO NOT GO OFF, SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG.  *AK",

NOT ONLY DID I NOT KNOW THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE IT , BUT ALSO THE POLICE OFFICER THAT WORKED MY ACCIDENT, AND 3 DODGE DEALERS DID NOT KNOW THIS.

I CAME BACK FOR IT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, AND ASK THEM TO HAND IT TO ME, IT WAS ON THE DASH, AND WHEN MY SON PULLED IT OFF, IT HIT THE GEAR SHIFT AND WENT INTO REVERSE INTO THE HIGHWAY , AND WAS STRUCK BY A ON COMING LOADED SEMI-TRUCK.  FORTUANTLY WE WAS NOT KILLED , BUT I WAS HANGING ON TO THE TRUCK TRYING TO STOP IT, AND DID GET SOME PULLED MUSCLES, AND GRANNY GOT A WHIPLASH.  MY POINT IS THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.

IF I RELEASE THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE GOING IN A STRAIGHT LINE DOWN THE ROAD, THE STEERING WHEEL WILL ROTATE ABOUT 1/4 INCH IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION AND THE VEHICLE LEAVES THE ROAD IN ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 10 SECONDS DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF THE ROAD.

I SPOKE TO THE DEALERSHIP'S TECHNICIAN (MIKE) THAT PERFORMED THE ALIGNMENT ALL FOUR TIMES AT THE DEALERSHIP.  HE STATES THAT THE VEHICLE DOES INDEED PULL TO THE RIGHT AND THAT HE HAS ALIGNED THE VEHICLE FOUR TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURE THE PROBLEM.  HE STATES THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND ON THE FOURTH ALIGNMENT HE HAD TO ADJUST THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL CASTER ADJUSTMENT OUT OF SPECIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHEIVE MARGINAL RESULTS.  HE ALSO STATED THAT BECAUSE THE ALIGNMENT IS NOW OUT OF SPECS., I MAY EXPERIENCE AN ADDITIONAL 1/16\" TIRE WEAR ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE DURING THE LIFE OF THE TIRES.  I HAD THE ALIGNMENT CHECKED AT A FIRESTONE DEALER PRIOR TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH ALIGNMENT BY THE DEALERSHIP.
