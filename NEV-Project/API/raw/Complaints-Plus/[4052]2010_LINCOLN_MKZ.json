THEN IN DECEMBER 2017 I RECEIVED ANOTHER NOTICE SAYING THE SAME INFORMATION BUT ALSO INCLUDED THERE ARE TO BE NO PASSENGERS IN THIS VEHICLE.   THIS VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER SERVING A PURPOSE FOR MY FAMILY TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MY SON. I RECEIVED ANOTHER NOTICE IN JUNE 2018 THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER TO BE DRIVEN AND I JUST RECEIVED MY RENTAL CAR ON JULY 10, 2018... THERE IS STILL NO PARTS CURRENTLY BEING DISTRIBUTED IN ORDER TO REPAIR MY CAR. MY VEHICLE HAS SAT, I HAVE HAD TO PAY A MECHANIC TO COME FLUSH IT AND PUT IN NEW BATTERIES ETC TO MAINTAIN IT AFTER NOT BEING DRIVEN. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE THIS RENTAL CAR NOW HOWEVER, IT HARDLY SEEMS TO MAKE IT BETTER AFTER PAYING ON A CAR FOR TWO YEARS THAT WAS NOT DEEMED SAFE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. I KNOW THAT THIS SITUATION HAS CAUSED MANY DISTRAUGHT CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER FOR ME AND MY SON WHO WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE, THIS SITUATION HAS TRULY BEEN A HARDSHIP.  MY SON'S NEEDS UNFORTUNATELY, PUT ME IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN'T  JUST \"UPGRADE\". THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NOVEMBER 2015 WITH 21,300 MILES AND TODAY IT STILL HAS LESS THEN 39,000 MILES DUE TO IT BEING UNFIT. A MOST DEVASTATING CHALLENGE TO MY FAMILY. I HAVE ALL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS SHOULD ANYONE WISH TO SEE THEM, I AM HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT. AT THIS POINT IT WILL BE HARD TURNING BACK OVER THE RENTAL CAR AS I FINALLY HAVE THE MEANS TO CARE FOR MY SON, GOING BACK TO THE SITTING LINCOLN WILL JUST BRING MORE PROBLEMS.  I HOPE SOMEONE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW EMOTIONALLY DAMAGING IT HAS BEEN FOR A FAMILY TO WAIT TWO + YEARS TO DRIVE IN THEIR VEHICLE DURING THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN THEIR LIFE",

EVENTUALLY THE REPEATED HAMMERING BY MY CAR AGAINST OTHER PARKED VEHICLES SLOWED MY CAR ENOUGH THAT I COULD BRAKE FINALLY, AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. ALTOGETHER MY AUTO HAD STRUCK AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED 6 OTHER VEHICLES. ACCELERATOR SEEMED STUCK DURING THE EVENT, AND BRAKES HAD NO EFFECT UNTIL CAR'S SPEED WAS SUFFICIENTLY SLOWED--BEFORE OPERATING. DAMAGE TO MY AUTO, PARTICULARLY THE ENTIRE FRONT END--GRILL AND FRONT FENDERS--WAS EXTENSIVE.  *TR",

I APPLIED THE BRAKES A FEW MORE TIMES, BUT STILL COULDN'T GET THE CAR TO STOP.  I BELIEVE I MOVED MY RIGHT FOOT MORE TO THE LEFT & TRIED TO STOP AGAIN. WHEN THAT DIDN'T STOP THE CAR, IN DESPERATION I MOVED MY FOOT TO THE RIGHT, PRESSING FIRMLY ONCE OR TWICE.  AT THAT POINT, MY FOOT EITHER SLIPPED OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL ON TO THE GAS PEDAL OR EVEN POSSIBLY HIT THE GAS PEDAL DIRECTLY.  THE CAR LURCHED  BACKWARD, KNOCKING THE FENCE DOWN & DAMAGING THE DRIVER DOOR.  MY WIFE & I WERE IN THE CAR,BUT SUFFERED NO INJURY.  NO OTHER PEOPLE OR VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED AT ALL.
