LOOKED IT UP ON U-TUBE, THE FUEL SENDING UNIT (FUEL PUMP) UNDER THE BACK SEAT LEAKS OVER TIME ESPECIALLY IN HOTTER CLIMATES. THERE WERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS ON LINE DUE TO THIS SAME ISSUE, CONCLUDING A DEFECTIVE PART ON THE FUEL PUMP THAT FORMS A CRACK ON TOP AND LEAKS FUEL WHEN VEHICLE IS IN USE.. CALLED VOLVO MAIN OFFICE, GAVE THEM THE VIN # AND THEY SAID \"NO, NOT ANY LIST !!\" SO WE TOOK IT TO THE NEAREST VOLVO DEALER IN LAS VEGAS, ALL MOST 2 HOURS AWAY. WE ALSO WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS YELLOW. TURNS OUT THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP AND THEY WOULD GLADLY REPLACE IT FOR $487.00 BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK UNTIL OUR NEXT VISIT-HAD TO ORDER THE NEW PUMP. THEY HAD US SIGN A WAIVER BEFORE WE LEFT BECAUSE THEY \" RECOMMEND VEHICLE NOT BE DRIVEN DUE TO THIS BEING A SAFETY ISSUE\"  HAVE MY COPY IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED. WE TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK THE NEXT WEEK AND THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF , WE PAID THE $487.00 AND THEY GAVE US A WARRANTY ON THE NEW FUEL PUMP FOR THE LIFE OF THE CAR .
