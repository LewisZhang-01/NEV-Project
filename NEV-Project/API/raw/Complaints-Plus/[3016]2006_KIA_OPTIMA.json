ABOUT 52,000 MILES, I STARTED HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE PARKING LIGHTS.  THE PARKING LIGHTS WOULD STAY ON WHEN CAR WAS TURNED OFF AND NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THE PARKING LIGHTS WILL NOT GO OFF.  THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE BATTERY FROM GOING DEAD WAS TO DISCONNECT THE NEGATIVE BATTERY TERMINAL. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WE TOOK THE CARS TO OUR LOCAL KIA DEALER FOR AN OIL CHANGE.  WHEN WE DROPPED THEM OFF FOR THE SERVICE, I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE ([XXX]), TO ALSO LOOK INTO THE PARKING LIGHT ISSUE AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM I HAD BEEN HAVING.

THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR HAS BEEN THE ISSUE FOR COUNTLESS OWNERS OF THIS MODEL AND HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY THE DEALER.  I HAVE HAD A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DONE AND. IT SHOWED THE SAME CODES POINTING TO THE ACCELERATOR.... MY DEALER STATED THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. IT IS AN $800 PART PLUS LABOR. I THINK THAT IF THIS PROBLEM PERSISTS IN MANY OF THESE MODELS AND THE PROBLEM CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH, THEN IT SHOULD. BE A RECALLED ITEM. THANK YOU *TR",

THE BELT ACTUALLY LOOKS FINE, BUT THE PULLEY FAILURE CAUSED THE BELT TO COME OFF.  THIS BELT RUNS SEVERAL THINGS SO THE INITIAL LOOSE PULLEY CAUSED THE CAR TO LOSE POWER STEERING, BATTERY LIGHT TO TURN ON, THE A/C FAILED, ETC., AND THEN THE INNER PART OF THE PULLEY CAME OFF AND THE OUTER RING (MAGNETIZED) FELL AND STUCK TO PART OF THE CAR FRAME THAT IS ACTUALLY METAL.  MY WIFE MADE IT TO WORK WHILE THE BELT HAD TO STILL BE ON BUT LOOSE, AND IT NOW SITS IN HER PARKING SPOT AT HER JOB (HOSPITAL PARKING RAMP). I WILL PROBABLY HAVE IT TOWED TOMORROW.

JULY 2007, THE KEY FOB AGAIN QUIT WORKING/TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I WAS TOLD A TSB WAS OUT ON THIS PROBLEM AND THEY WOULD REPLACE THE RECEIVER WHICH WAS DONE. NOV 2007 AFTER THE TSB SUPPOSEDLY WAS TAKEN CARE OF, AGAIN THE KEY FOB QUITS WORKING/DEALERSHIP HAS AGAIN REPROGRAMMED TO WORK AGAIN AND CURRENTLY THEY CONTINUE TO WORK. THIS CAR HANDLES EXTREMELY POORLY AND IN MY OPINION IS A SAFETY RISK. IT SEEMS TO HAVE A PRETTY LOOSE SUSPENSION AND A LOT OF SWAYING WHEN DRIVING. THE CAR PULLS HARD TO THE LEFT CAUSING ONE TO HAVE TO HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL TIGHT TO KEEP IT FROM TAKING NEARLY A 45 DEGREE LEFT TURN WHILE DRIVING. WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES, THE CAR PULLS BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT/USUALLY LEFT. WHEN DRIVING OVER A SMOOTH DIP IN THE ROAD, IT FEELS THE FRONT TIRES ACTUALLY LEAVE THE GROUND SLIGHTLY CAUSING THE STEERING WHEEL TO VIBRATE RIGHT/LEFT QUICKLY. THIS VEHICLE ALSO HANDLES EXTREMELY POORLY ON ICY ROADS. THIS IS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE WORST HANDLING VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DRIVEN...CONCERNS ME AS I DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY ABOUT 35 MILES TO WORK ONE WAY DAILY, AND DRIVE IN WINDY AS WELL AS SNOW AND ICY CONDITIONS FAIRLY FREQUENTLY.  AT ABOUT 15,000 MILES, THE LATCH ON THE GAS DOOR DOESN'T WANT TO STAY CLOSED AFTER YOU FUEL UP AND THE ELECTRONICS THAT OPERATE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS INTERMITTENTLY DO NOT WORK.
