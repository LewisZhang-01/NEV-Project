MY AXLE WEIGHT LOADED HAS NEVER EXCEEDED 4,500 LBS.  DURING A TRIP INSPECTION WHILE TRAVELING TWO WEEKS AGO I DISCOVERED THE RIGHT REAR SPRING SHACKLE WAS RIPPING OUT OF THE FRAME. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURE ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAVE REPAIRED THE SAME DEFECT ON SEVERAL OF THESE TRAILERS AND THE MANUFACTURE'S SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD TO INCREASE THE WALL THICKNESS OF THE FRAME TUBES ON THIS MODEL TRAILER TO CORRECT THE DEFECT STARTING IN MAY OF 2014 . I HAD THE FAILING FRAME TEMPORARILY REPAIRED AT A FAB SHOP THAT WAS NEAR WHERE THE FAILING SUSPENSION/FRAME WAS DISCOVERED. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURE HAVE REFUSED TO PROPOSE A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE DEFECT.   *TR",
