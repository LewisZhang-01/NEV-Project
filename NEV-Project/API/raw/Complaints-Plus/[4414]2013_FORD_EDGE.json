In my almost 30 years of driving I have NEVER experienced something so terrifying! I literally could've died (or caused a collision with another person, endangering everyone involved). I immediately took my car (2013 Ford Edge Limited) to the dealership where I purchased the vehicle (Valencia). They tell me it's the HCU (Hydraulic Control Unit) and will cost me $2,000 to replace! This is an OBVIOUS safety issue and a matter of life or death. Upon doing more research, I have discovered that this is an ongoing issue with Ford vehicles and I feel it is UNACCEPTABLE to allow people to be put in these types of situations KNOWING of this defect! And to not recall/repair the issue?! Shame on Ford! Something needs to be done. They are putting everyone's lives and safety at risk! I purchased my car new on Labor Day 2013 so I've had it 8.5 years BUT it only has 42,000 miles on it! And it is very well-maintained and in immaculate condition. There were no warning lights or sounds or anything. Just no brakes. On a CANYON road! I feel this is absolutely unacceptable and now I am not even comfortable driving my own car anymore! I was already a bit of an \"anxious\" driver but now I'm totally traumatized and feel I can't trust my own car's braking system?! Just crazy! Please do something about this NOW",

Known common issue that will cost a thousand to fix. Master brake cylinder has been replaced and still having faulty petal issues that is no longer covered. The panoramic roof does not work and it is a known issue almost every edge has. And now sever safety issues with the ABS system and traction control. There is no excuse for this poor manufacturing and no recalls to fix them. There were absolutely zero warning signs or check engine lights that came on prior to any of these systems happening. The transmission never through a code at all until after it locked up. The ABS system went out while driving down the road on a rainy day causing me to loose control and luckily I was able to get it into the ditch instead of into oncoming traffic. It put my life and my friends lives in danger. Ford should be sued for this and made to recall every single edge or other vehicle with these components. I have no fixed the issue yet because I wanted to submit this issue to the NHTSA and have it available to be inspected if they wanted. This vehicle is extremely unsafe and has had issues non stop. The transmission went out also while driving on the highway and just locked up causing me to almost get hit from the rear. And the replacement transmission is already having issues again with less than 15,000 miles on it. This",

This always occurred following a quick hard stop, such as is required to avoid an animal or other unforeseen road hazard.  Deliberately pushing the brake pedal with another quick, hard application (i.e. slamming the brakes) would then alleviate the soft pedal issue temporarily, only to have the entire scenario repeat itself.  There are no warning lamps, messages or indications that there is a problem.  The service department at Sunrise Ford in Fort Pierce, FL confirmed the problem and replaced the brake booster in accordance with Customer Satisfaction Program 13N02 (occurred on 3/5/21 at 81, 896 miles). Replacing the brake booster did not fix the problem.  In fact, the soft fading brake pedal sinking to the floor is now continuous, and happens upon every brake application.  This most definitely is a safety issue that endangers the vehicle occupants and all others on the road in the vicinity to include pedestrians.  It puts everyone at risk because a soft fading brake pedal that goes to the floor delays the braking action of the vehicle, hence a longer stopping distance and possible collision.  I have an appointment with the Sunrise Ford Dealership and I have stopped driving this vehicle until the manufacturer/dealership can provide a solution.

Had another near miss accident in Kansas City, MO a car ran in front of me car brakes failed to stop, I swerved into next lane in front of car in that lane to avoid accident. Called MOBILE AUTOMOBILE MECHANICS OF KANSAS CITY, I was told it was Brake Master Cylinder and would cost $1,100.00. I rejected that cost. I took vehicle to AAMCO AUTO REPAIR. Brake Master Cylinder was replaced for $387.01. Brakes failed again next day had another mishap with braking. Returned vehicle to AAMCO. Diagnostic done. I was told it was the Anti Lock breaks, and I need to take vehicle to dealer. I took vehicle to Dealer THOROUGHBRED FORD. I gave them diagnostics from AAMCO. I was told there was a Brake Booster recall on my car, and looks like that is maybe what the problem is. Make appointment. I brought car in was told further inspection showed it not brake booster, it is HCU HUDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT. Make another appointment will cost $1,600.00. I cannot afford that much more money. I went home looked on internet about 2013 Ford Edge HCU, found that failed HCU Is a common problem for this vehicle. I called other brake repair shops to see if could get better price was told due to pandemic parts were backed up and would be several months before could receive part. I was in several near misses of having an accident in an fairly new 8 year old vehicle. There is no recall on HCU when this is a common problem that can potentially cause someone their life, like it almost did me. I had to trade this vehicle to REED GMC BUICK because I needed reliable transportation to travel to help my elderly parents. I will also report to other agencies about this problem.",

The SYNC system will shut down while driving and also disable many features of the vehicle.  Such as the radio turning off, doors not unlocking, shifting disabled, headlights turn on dimly, etc.  The battery tests normal and so does the alternator, however the regulator within the alternator will not pass through enough charge to the battery to stay charged.  Hence, why most people will change the battery and still have the problem later.  I understand as parts age they do fail, however this has been a known issue since early versions of the car and it has yet to be corrected.  Many of the complaints on NHTSA are related to this, however some people are not aware due to lack of testing the particular item.  They will write complaints about radio shutting off or headlights wont turn on(which is really dangerous as well).  It often happens while driving, a warning will show up saying \"Sync shutting down.....\".  Driver's are unaware that they are only driving on the battery power at this point because when they get it checked by a mechanic, both the battery and alternator test as they are supposed too.  They alternator is still creating voltage however the regulator, not tested individually, won't allow enough to go through to recharge the battery.    The most concerning part is if certain electrical components not deemed necessary by the SYNC system are shut down they could lead to more catastrophic incidents. For example; ABS braking not slowing the vehicle, door wont unlock in emergency situation, etc.  I had both battery and alternator checked by a tech from Oreilly's Auto Parts and a mechanic from a local auto shop.  I was informed that it must be the battery since the alternator is performing, So the battery was changed Friday 08/13/2021.

Then today May 30, I needed to run to the grocery store but before I left I had my son look underneath the hood because I thought maybe a fluid or freon may have caused the scene but soon found out that there is no way for any fluids to penetrate to the tires because there is a solid panel separating the mechanisms underneath the hood from the wheels and tire. That made me take a closer look at the inside of the wheel covers/caps and low and behold you can see because of the dark color of the fluid in the wells of the wheels; brake fluid has been spewing now, both times as far as I can tell.  I don't know how long it takes for the fluid reservoir to become empty, but I sure wouldn't want to be driving my vehicle when that happens. So this is in my opinion a \"Life or Death\" Safety Hazard and would really be appreciative for an immediate response!  I need your suggestion as soon as you're able to, what should be my next step. I am a senior citizen and I purchased this 2013 vehicle as my future retirement vehicle in 2014 and retired in 2017. I believed it would be a nice, sturdy well-built and reliable vehicle for years to come. I've owned many a vehicle and have never had any major brake issues during all those years, just regular maintenance on brakes and other expected low maintenance. Never anything of this magnitude to put my life in danger. Wow! An 8 year old vehicle with just under 73,000 miles on the odometer driven less that 50 miles per month, I wouldn't have ever thought this could happen.  Hopefully, there is a Safety Recall for this model as well. Still researching....",

The customer satisfaction program 13N02 released in January of 2014 identifies that \u201cit is possible for the brake booster on your vehicle to develop a small tear in the diaphragm.\u201d This is what has occurred in my vehicle under 100,000 miles. The recall/program covers vehicles made prior to March 28, 2013 and my vehicle was made in approximately June. As a result my request for relief has to this point been denied. I am very disappointed as it is an identical issue to the recall but because my car is approximately 90 days younger than others identified, I am out $940.30 dollars for the repair.   The repair is completed now. The vehicle was not stopping responsively and put myself and others at risk. My auto mechanic confirmed the issue and identified it as the same described in the recall noted above. There were no warning lamps or other symptoms to make us aware of the issue. Ford denies to cover my repair as it is a vehicle made shortly after the bulletin identifies.",

THE ISSUE WAS POSSIBILITY OF BREAK BOOSTER PREMATURE FAILURE LEADING TO UNPREDICTABLE BRAKING PERFORMANCE. THERE ARE 2 SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THIS NOTICE:    1. THE PART THAT FAILS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH IMMEDIATE RECALL INSTEAD OF AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OFFERING - AS THE FAILURE OF THIS PART LEADS TO UNPREDICTABLE BRAKING PERFORMANCE AT AN UNPREDICTABLE TIME FRAME.    2. IT ONLY COVERS VEHICLES PRODUCED BETWEEN CERTAIN DATES, WHILE THE REAL EXTENT OF FAULTY BRAKE SYSTEM COMPONENT GOES WAY BEYOND THE SCOPE COVERED IN THIS NOTICE.    I OWN A 2013 FORD EDGE TRUCK WITH PRODUCTION DATE OF 06/13. THE MILEAGE ON THIS VEHICLE IS UNDER 58000. ABOUT A WEEK AGO THE BRAKING FUNCTION OF THIS CAR HAS FAILED SIGNIFICANTLY LEADING TO A NEAR CRASH SITUATION. THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING CLOSER TO A TRAFFIC STOP AT ABOUT 20 MPH AND STARTED GRADUALLY APPLYING BRAKES AND TO MY SURPRISE THE CAR KEPT ON MOVING WITHOUT ANY NOTICEABLE BRAKING APPLIED. REALIZING THAT, I PRESSED THE PEDAL MUCH HARDER TO A DEGREE THAT WOULD BE CLOSE TO ACTIVATING ABS AND ONLY THEN THE CAR CAME TO A  HARD STOP.  AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS I STARTED RESEARCHING ONLINE AND HAVE LEARNED ABOUT FORD'S NOTICE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY ON BRAKE BOOSTER PART FAILURE - 13N02. I HAD EXACTLY THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS BULLETIN. UPON VISITING DEALERSHIP, THEY REFUSED TO SERVICE MY CAR UNDER THIS EXTENDED WARRANTY AS MY CAR WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE PRODUCTION DATES COVERED BY 13N02. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS ISSUE IMPACTED A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF FORD EDGE 2013 OWNERS, WHOSE SAFETY CONCERNS ARE PLAINLY IGNORED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY SAME AS IS MY CASE.

AT THE NEXT STOP SIGN, I STARTED SLOWING DOWN EVEN SOONER AND AGAIN THE BRAKE PEDAL GOES CLEAR TO THE FLOOR.  I PULLED OVER AND SHUT MY CAR OFF AND CALLED MY HUSBAND.  HE HAD ME RESTART THE VEHICLE AND BACK UP AND GO FORWARD SLOWLY.  THE BRAKE PEDAL THEN FELT LIKE IT HAD PRESSURE AND WAS STOPPING ME.  I CAREFULLY DRIVE HOME, LEAVING A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN ME AND VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME.  THIS MORNING THE BRAKES ARE AGAIN SPONGY BUT THEY ARE STOPPING ME WHEN MY PEDAL IS NEARLY FULLY DEPRESSED.  I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR 2013 FORD EDGE BRAKE BOOSTER BUT WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING THEY INFORM ME THAT MY 2013 FORD EDGE IS NOT INCLUDED.

ASIDE FROM THE ISSUE OF THE DOORS POTENTIALLY OPENING THERE IS THE POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE OCCUPANTS OF UNWANTED ACCESS BY UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE.  THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND LOCKED THE INTERIOR LIGHTS REMAIN ON RESULTING IN BATTERIES BEING WORN DOWN AND DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS STRANDED.  NOT A WONDERFUL THOUGHT IN FREEZING WINTER CONDITIONS.  THE FINAL POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT THERE WERE 1349 COMPLAINTS, NOW 1350, FILED PRIOR TO MINE.  AN OLD RULE OF THUMB HAS BEEN THAT FOR EVERYONE WHO WILL TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE A LETTER OF COMPLAINT THERE ARE 10,000 MORE WHO WILL NOT.  THE MATH SAYS 13,500,000.

IT DID NOT HAPPEN EVERY TIME WE DROVE THE CAR, BUT WHEN IT DID HAPPEN, THE MESSAGE KEPT REPEATING & THERE WAS NO WAY TO STOP IT.  ON JULY 26, 2016, WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER & FOUND OUT THE PROBLEM WAS THE DOOR LATCH.  IT COST $486.57 FOR REPLACEMENT (SEE INVOICE).  WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION, I TALKED TO THE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP & HE SAID THAT IT WAS 'POSSIBLE' THAT WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED BY FORD IF A RECALL WERE ISSUED.  ANOTHER FORD WORKER IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID HE DOES NOT THINK THERE WILL BE A RECALL BECAUSE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN THAT MANY INCIDENTS.  AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF INCIDENTS.  IF THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW, FORD SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  WE ARE LIVING ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND $486.57 IS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR INCOME.  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR FORD'S MISTAKE.

THREE TIMES IN AS MANY DAYS WHEN FOOD IS ON BRAKE, THE BRAKE PUSHES BACK ESSENTIALLY HAVING LOST POWER BRAKES AND REQUIRING BOTH FEET FIRMLY PRESSED ON BRAKE TO EVEN REMOTELY SLOW CAR DOWN, UNABLE TO COMPLETELY STOP VEHICLE,  AT THE SAME TIME I LOSE POWER STEERING AND CANNOT CONTROL DIRECTION OF CAR, THE WARNING LIGHT \"LOW OIL PRESSURE\" ILLUMINATES ON THE DASH.  THIS DOES NOT SEND CAR INTO SO CALLED \"LIMP HOME\" MODE IT RENDERS THE CAR ESSENTIALLY INOPERABLE. IF I TURN THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON AGAIN IT RETURNS TO NORMAL DRIVING FUNCTION....UNTIL IT HAPPENS AGAIN. I'VE BEEN LUCKY THAT THIS HAPPENED BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND IN STRAIGHT LANE STOP AND GO TRAFFIC ON CITY STREETS.  HAD THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING ALONG A CURVY MOUNTAIN ROAD, ALONG THE COAST OR ON A LOS ANGELES FREEWAY MOVING 65 MPH..I DOUBT I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO LUCKY.

FAST FORWARD TO THIS LAST MONTH. THE DOOR WAS AGAIN BECOMING AN ISSUE. MEANING, THE PROBLEM EXISTED EVERY TIME I CLOSED MY DOOR BUT IF I KEPT CLOSING AND OPENING THE DOOR, EVENTUALLY AFTER 5-6 TIMES, THE CAR WOULD REGISTER THE DOOR AS CLOSED. I MADE AN APT TELLING THE SERVICE GUY THAT I WAS HAVING THE PROBLEM AGAIN AND WE MADE AN APT. I DROPPED OFF MY CAR YESTERDAY AT 3:30. WE GOT A CALL AT 4 PM STATING OUR CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AS WE ARE OVER OUR 36,000 MILEAGE LIMIT (WE ARE AT 39,000). I REMINDED HIM IT WAS COVERED BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS REPORTED LAST YEAR WHEN THEY FIXED IT. HE (SAM) TOLD ME THAT HE HAD GONE THROUGH MY INVOICES AND THERE IS NO RECORD OF THIS WORK BEING DONE. I THEN SAID MAYBE THEY FIXED IT AND FORGOT TO WRITE IT DOWN. I WAS TOLD NO THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN. I SAID THEY HAD TO TAKE THE DOOR PANEL OFF FOR THE OTHER ISSUE AND I WAS TOLD THAT WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE SENSOR. I WENT TO THE PARTS COUNTER AND WAS TOLD THAT INDEED, THE SENSOR IS ON THE EDGE OF THE DOOR AND YOU WOULD  NEED TO REMOVE THE PANEL TO GET TO IT. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT. I THEN INFORMED THEM OF HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE  ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE SO IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A WEAR AND TEAR OR PERSONAL MISTREATMENT ISSUE AND THAT FORD SHOULD NOT BE SHIRKING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS BEING BROUGHT AROUND.

OF  COURSE, I HAD NO POWER OR POWER STEERING, BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR OVER TO THE SHOULDER SAFELY (FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A SHOULDER).  THE FORD EMERGENCY ROAD SERVICE SENT A TOW TRUCK, WHICH TOWED THE CAR TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALER.         THE NEXT DAY THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPT. FOUND THAT THE FUEL SENDER HAD BECOME DETACHED FROM THE FUEL PUMP.  OF COURSE, WITHOUT FUEL, THE ENGINE STOPPED.  THEY RE-ATTACHED THE SENDER, AND I HAVE HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEM.  EVERYTHING WAS HANDLED PROMPTLY AND PROPERLY BY FORD.  THERE WAS NO CHARGE, OF COURSE, AS THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.         HOWEVER, HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED JUST FIVE MINUTES EARLIER, I WAS IN THE INSIDE LANE OF A BUSY INTERSTATE HIGHWAY (I-285) GOING 70 MPH.

THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE WRONG CIRCUIT BREAKER ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN INSTALLED ON THE BATTERY. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE FUSE WAS BY-PASSED WITH THE USE OF A LARGE PAPER CLIP.  TALK ABOUT RIGGING SOMETHING UP!!!  THIS PAPER CLIP HAD GOTTEN SO HOT IT EVEN BURNED A HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE BATTERY ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER.  I HAVE A PHOTO. THIS WAS ONLY DISCOVERED WHEN THE NEW CIRCUIT BREAKER ASSEMBLY WAS ABOUT TO BE INSTALLED. IT WAS ALL HIDDEN BY THE RUBBER COVER. WE DID NOT THINK TO INSPECT THIS UPON PURCHASE IN JULY, 2013. IT WAS A BRAND NEW CAR!  THIS WAS A TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN.  FORTUNATELY IT DID NOT.

FMC HAS DOCUMENTATION OF HIS STATEMENT.  SM TOOK PICTURES OF THE MOON ROOF AND SUBMITTED A TO FMC.  FMC IMMEDIATELY DENIED THE REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENT. IN THE MEANTIME, THE SERVICE MANAGER ESCALATED THE REQUEST BECAUSE HE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS WAS NOT A RESULT OF SOMETHING HITTING MY MOON ROOF.  THE REQUEST WAS ONCE AGAIN DENIED.  MR.XXX HAS CONTINUED TO MAKE CALLS ON MY BEHALF THIS WEEK TO FMC, ASKING HOW ANYONE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION WITHOUT SENDING SOMEONE TO INSPECT THE MOON ROOF FIRSTHAND.  HE WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD FOR THREE DAYS THAT FORD WAS WORKING ON COMING UP WITH A RESOLUTION.  ON 10/23/13 FORD CALLED AND OFFERED TO PAY FOR HALF THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THE MOON ROOF.  DUE TO THE LACK OF SERVICE FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY, I HAD TO SUBMIT A CLAIM THROUGH MY PERSONAL CAR INSURANCE.",

SHE WAS APPROACHING THE SCHOOL AT ABOUT 20 MPH ON LEVEL STREET WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  SHE SOON REALIZED THAT THE ENGINE HAD STALLED.  LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CHILDREN PRESENT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP WITHOUT INCIDENT.  SHE STARTED THE VEHICLE AND PULLED INTO THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT.  I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE DEALER (TOWN AND COUNTRY FORD OF EVANSVILLE INDIANA) AND WAS TOLD TO BRING IT IN SO THAT THEY COULD FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSE AND TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK IN THE NEXT TIME THAT THE PROBLEM OCCURRED.  I ALSO INFORMED THEM OF A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT MOVING FOR NO KNOWN REASON AND ABOUT GETTING MUCH LESS THAN THE STATED GAS MILEAGE ON PURE HIGHWAY DRIVING.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS EITHER.  I REQUESTED THE NUMBER OF SOMEONE THAT I COULD CALL TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THESE ISSUES.  I WAS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM THE INITIAL CONTACT REFERRED ME TO A MANAGER.  INITIALLY THE MANAGER OFFERED NO MORE THAT THE DEALERSHIP, THAT IS TO BRING IT IN AFTER IT FAILS AGAIN.  I EXPLAINED MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUES OF LOSING CONTROL AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED OR IN A SCHOOL ZONE.  HE STATED THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM.
