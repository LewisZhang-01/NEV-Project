BUT WHEN I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR, IT KEPT ACCELERATING. NOTHING STOPPED THIS SHORT OF PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, EVEN PRESSING ON THE BRAKES WITH ALL MY WEIGHT ONLY SLOWED THE CAR DOWN. I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY MIND. NOTHING WORKED EXCEPT FOR TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES, PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, THEN PARK, AND TURN THE CAR OFF. WHEN I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON, EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER PROBLEMS WITH MY NITRO. IT MAY BE A GLITCH BUT THIS IS TOO SCARY TO NOT REPORT. NO ONE WAS HURT THANKFULLY, BUT WE WERE SECONDS AWAY FROM BEING AUTOMATICALLY FORCED INTO AN INTERSECTION OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC IF MY BOYFRIEND HADN'T BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO TELL ME TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TURN IT OFF. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP (ITS THERE RIGHT NOW, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALER AFTER THIS HAPPENED). I COULD HAVE SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED MYSELF, OR SOMEONE ELSE. I KNOW I HAVE READ OTHER FORUMS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR NITRO. I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING GETTING A NEW CAR AND NEVER BUYING FROM DODGE AGAIN. I HAVE A BRAND NEW BABY I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AND THAT WAS TOO SCARY TO EVEN RISK HAPPENING AGAIN. DODGE NEEDS  TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, ITS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY VEHICLE TO PERFORM LIKE THIS, EVEN ONCE. ESPECIALLY WHEN LIVES ARE AT STAKE.  *TR",

THE HORNS ARE HIDDEN IN THE ENGINE/BUMPER AREA SO MY ONLY CHOICE WAS TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY.  THIS WAS DONE BY THE PROMPTING OF THE POLICE OFFICER THAT ANSWERED THE \"DISTRESS\" CALL THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE 911 DISPATCHER.  UPON HOOKING THE BATTERY BACK UP THE NEXT MORNING, NOTHING WAS ABNORMAL UNTIL I STARTED TO DRIVE TO WORK.  THE HORN WOULD BLOW AT RANDOM ONCE AGAIN FOR THE ENTIRE 36 MILE TRIP TO MY JOB. I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS AN UNKNOWN PROBLEM TO THEM AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS AND REPAIRS. I THINK THIS IS SAD TO HAVE A 22 MONTH OLD VEHICLE THAT WAS PURCHASE BRAND NEW AND HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  I RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND WHICH FUSES CONTROL THE HORN CIRCUIT AND REMOVED THEM TO KEEP THE PEACE WITH THE NEIGHBORS AND NOT ANGER OTHER DRIVERS . I HAVE HAD 3 ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER DRIVERS NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND NEEDED TO SIGNAL THEM, ONLY TO NOT HAVE A HORN. I WAS FORCED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC LAST NIGHT (12/7/11) , NO ACCIDENT, BUT REAL DARN CLOSE. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT OF A SAFETY ITEM THE HORN IS UNTIL I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.
