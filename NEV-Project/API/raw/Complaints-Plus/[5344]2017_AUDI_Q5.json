I resumed traveling and found steering to be stiff and over steer(feeling as if the wheels tilted) when turning left or right. After stopping for approximately 20 minutes I returned to my vehicle to resume my trip. The stirring operated normally.  2nd occurrence(9/27/21): Approximately three weeks later the power steering completely failed and remained that way until I returned to my residence. Since there was no recall listed and the original warranty has expired I called a repair shop to have the vehicle checked(first available appointment was two weeks out but I could leave the vehicle and they would do an assessment if they could fit it in their schedule.   3rd occurrence(9/30/21): Power steering failed but I was able to maintain control. The power operated the following day but travel was limited.  I hope an assessment can be completed within the next two days. I did purchase an extended warranty through the dealership.  Note: each event occurred during favorable weather conditions(no rain, ice, snow or storms of any kind).",
