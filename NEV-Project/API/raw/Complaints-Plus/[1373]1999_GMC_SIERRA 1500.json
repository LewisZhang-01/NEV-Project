        "summary": "ABS Brakes cut out leaving you with little to no brakes. No warning light appears. This continues on and off over time. Then that ABS warning light came on. When the warning light was on, brakes worked just not ABS. Light would go out and back to the original issue.  Took it in to dealership when the light remained on. They reset the light and told me every thing was fine. And charged me $$$. ABS Brake warning light can right back on. Had the manager drive it. Told me it was fine, brakes worked well. The ABS warning would go in and out. Removed the ABS fuse, so I could depend on being able to stop, without having to worry about the ABS cutting in and out for a few years. Watched for recalls, nothing appeared. Noticed on blogs, others were having the same issue. Took it to a great mechanic! Who verified there were no leaks in the brake lines, replaced one line that had been known to have issues on this type of truck and verified there were no air bubbles on the lines. Still same issue, then replaced the computer system for the ABS. No codes ever came up on the computer system that I can recall.  Had more issues with the ABS. Would go to stop, (generally on a hill) then when it came to the final stopping, I had NO BRAKES, had to slam on the brakes to stop. ABS Brake warning lights never came on. My mechanic looked and looked and relooked into this. Found from others that blogged that they had similar issues, that one or both of the ABS Brake sensors were not responding evenly causing an issue. Changed out the sensor. All is good now. This issues could have put and my family in danger a number of times. I was blessed to avoid a few accidents by driving far enough behind people and or had an emergency line to pull into when unable to stop.  Hope a recall comes soon for these issues to prevent someone from being killed. These took place from about 2015-fixed 2020. Email me with a report number and where I can upload info at a later date, I will do so.",

APRIL 2009    UPON DOING AN OIL CHANGED, MYSELF, I DISCOVER THE ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES, INCLUDING THE FRONT AS WELL AS THE REAR ARE IN VERY BAD SHAPE DUE TO RUST.  AFTER SPEAKING TO MY MECHANIC I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE GM BRAKE LIKE FROM THE LATE 90S TO 2004 WERE NOT PROPERLY DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THE WEATHER AND RESIST CORROSION.  HE SAID AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK HE HAS TO REPLACE SECTIONS OF GM BRAKE LINE FROM THESE TRUCKS AND SUVS.
