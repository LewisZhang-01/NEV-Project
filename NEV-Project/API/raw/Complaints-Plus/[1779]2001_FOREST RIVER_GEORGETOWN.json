I TOLD THE SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEY AGREED.  IN FACT WHEN THEY DROVE IT AROUND TO THE SERVICE AREA THEY HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP IT BEFORE HITTING A WALL.  AFTER FIXING MY JACKS I HAD TO HAVE MY UNIT TOWED TO A PLACE TO FIX THE BRAKES, SINCE THIS CAMPING WORLD WAS NEW AND DID NOT HAVE THE FACILITY FOR BRAKES YET.  AT THE NEW FACILITY AFTER INSPECTING SAID 3 OF THE 4 BRAKES, CALIPERS HAD TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH OTHER BRAKE PROBLEMS.  AND THAT I WAS LUCKY NOT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT!!!

ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE TIRE ON THE WHEEL WAS THE TWO SIDE WALLS. FORTUNATELY THE FRONT TIRE ON THE CURB SIDE DID NOT FAIL. WE INSTALLED THE SPARE TIRE AND CONTINUED. ABOUT 80 MILES FARTHER THE FRONT TIRE ON THE DRIVER\u0019S SIDE FAILED IN THE SAME MANNER. I RETRIEVED A CHUNK OF THE TIRE TREAD FROM THE HIGHWAY. LATER I FOUND ANOTHER PIECE UNDER THE BATH TUB.  THE DAMAGE TO THE TRAILER WAS REPAIRED FOR $142.13 (NEW INNER FENDER $49.95, NEW TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY FOR LICENSE PLATE $12.18, REPLACEMENT PLATE $5.00 AND LABOR $75.00).    WITH TWO FAILURES WITHIN 100 MILES, WE DECIDED TO REPLACE ALL FIVE TIRES.     THE FAILED TIRES WERE CARLISLE RADIAL ST, ST175/80R13 LOAD RANGE C. OTHER NUMBERS ON THE SIDE WALL OF THE SPARE TIRE WHICH I KEPT UNMOUNTED ARE: CR9579-2, AND DRCD80-A-EFS.  I PHONED CARLISLE TIRE AND TOLD MY STORY TO THEIR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE. SHE SAID THE TIRE WARRANTY WAS FOR TWO YEARS. I SAID I WAS UNHAPPY WITH CARLISLE TIRES AND THE FACT THAT THEIR CATASTROPHIC FAILURE DAMAGED MY TRAILER.
