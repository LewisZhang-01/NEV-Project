TO AVOID A CRASH, THE ONLY OPTION I HAD WAS TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND TURN IN TO A PARKING LOT. ONCE IN NEUTRAL, THE ENGINE'S RPM REMAINED CLOSE TO 4,000. AFTER TURNING THE IGNITION OFF, I INSPECTED UNDER THE HOOD OF THE CAR TO FIND THAT THE FLIMSY PLASTIC PIECE THAT HOLDS THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE IN THE PROPER POSITION WAS BROKEN IN SEVERAL PLACES, LEAVING THE CABLE FREE TO GET CAUGHT ON WHAT IS LEFT OF THE PLASTIC PIECE EXTREMELY EASILY. SINCE THAT INCIDENT, THE EXACT SAME SITUATION HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES. DUE TO THE PLASTIC PIECE BEING BROKEN, THE CABLE DOES NOT SIT INSIDE THE PLASTIC PIECE AS INTENDED, WHICH HAS CAUSED THE RPM TO STAY HIGHER THAN NORMAL AT ALL TIMES WHEN THE CAR IS IN GEAR.

WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED BY A NYS FACILITY I WAS TOLD THAT EXCESSIVE RUST WAS AN ISSUE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THEY SEE THIS ON THE TAURUS REGULARLY AND HAVE FAILED VEHICLES DUE TO THIS ISSUE. I CONTACTED FORD , THEY SAID OUT OF WARRANTY. THEY DO NOT SELL REPLACEMENT FRAMES AND SUGGESTED I PURCHASE AN AFTERMARKET FRAME AND HAVE REPAIRS DONE. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 37 YEARS AND WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE, YOUNG NEW DRIVERS WITHOUT EXPERIENCE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THESE VEHICLES. I AM REQUESTING THAT THE NHTSA LOOK IN TO THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF MAJOR COMPONENTS IN THE TAURUS DUE TO LOW GRADE MATERIAL USE. THE FORD COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO RECALL MINIVANS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE- YET THE TAURUS WHICH FORD SAYS IS ONE OF ITS BEST SELLING VEHICLES HAS BEEN COMPLETELY IGNORED WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IF THIS VEHICLE WERE MANUFACTURED BY TOYOTA IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED YEARS AGO. SHAME ON THE POWERS THAT BE THAT ALLOW THIS SITUATION TO CONTINUE. THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED AS NEW OE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, USED PARTS ARE NOT AN OPTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ALSO WILL BE ROTTED BEYOND USE. I HAD A 1940S DODGE PARKED IN A FARM FIELD BY A PREVIOUS OWNER THAT HAD LESS RUST THAN THIS VEHICLE HAD WHEN IT WAS UNDER 5 YEARS OLD. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT QUALITY?  *KB",

I THEN CONTACTED AIRPORT FORD IN FLORENCE, KY AND EXPLAINED WHAT I WAS TOLD BY FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE 3 BROKEN COIL SPRINGS, THEY TOLD ME I COULD NOT BE HELPED SINCE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT ANY RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE.  RECALL 04V332000 RECALLED THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILE, WHICH THIS CAR IS STILL COVERED.  RATHER THAN CONTINUE DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE, I DECIDED TO GET THE CAR FIXED.  I HAD THE COIL SPRINGS, WHEEL BEARINGS, BALL JOINTS, TIE RODS, DRIVE SHAFTS, AND ROTORS REPLACED ON THIS CAR.  THE 2 BROKEN FRONT COIL SPRINGS DESTROYED EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BY PLACING UNNECESSARY STRESS ON THESE COMPONENTS.  THE REAR COIL SPRING WAS INCHES AWAY FROM PUNCTURING THE TIRE OF THIS VEHICLE; THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I BELIEVE THAT AT A MINIMUM THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY FORD DUE TO THE RECALL AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THESE FRACTURED SPRINGS; THIS COST ME $343.12.

SINCE I HAVE OWNED IT, IT HAS NOT GIVEN ME TOO MANY PROBLEMS, JUST THE BASIC BREAK DOWNS LIKE, BATTERIES, BRAKES ,SEIZED A/C COMPRESSOR,COOLANT EXPANSION TANK CRACKED, ECT. THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BREAK.  BUT WHAT HAS REALLY UPSET ME IS HOW I HAVE READ ABOUT THE COIL SPRINGS BREAKING ON THE TAURUS AND CAUSING POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME BUT AFTER ARRIVING HOME TODAY I NOTICED A SMALL PIECE OF METAL UNDER MY 01 TAURUS AND AFTER FURTHER OBSERVATION I FOUND IT TO BE A PIECE OF MY REAR COIL SPRING FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE. I AM A 40+ YEAR OLD MALE WHO HAS HAD MANY MAKES AND MODELS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES AND HAVE NEVER HAD OR HEARD OF COIL SPRINGS BREAKING AS THEY DO ON THE FORD TAURUS. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED BY FORD AND NOT THE CONSUMER.  SO I CAN ONLY EXPECT THAT THE REST OF THE SPRINGS ARE FAULTY AND NEED TO BE REPLACED BEFORE I HAVE ANY FURTHER DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FORD COMPANY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CRAFTMANSHIP OR THE CONSUMERS SAFETY. SO CHANGE YOUR SLOGAN  \" HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FORD LATELY\" TO \" YOUR RIDING ON FAULTY COIL SPRINGS\".

DESPITE THE NHTSA TESTS ON SIMILAR VEHICLE DEFECT, I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL INCIDENT IS UNLIKELY.

WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO DRIVE THIS CAR FOR EXTENDED USE ON CROWDED INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS IN ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS LIKE SO MANY OF US DO?     THE PARTS IN QUESTION FAIL BECAUSE OF CORROSION. IN MOST CASES THE SPRING BREAKS AT THE LOWER FIRST COIL, FORD HAS INSTALLED A SHIELD TO PREVENT RELATED TIRE DAMAGE PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER:  04V332000  HERE IS MY POINT AS PLAINLY AS I CAN PUT IT. THESE SPRINGS WILL CORRODE AT ANY LOCATION DUE TO STONE CHIPS OR OTHER SURFACE IMPERFECTIONS. AS A RESULT THESE SPRINGS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BREAK AT ANY LOCATION RENDERING THE SHIELD AT THE LOWER COIL USELESS. THE RESULT COULD BE A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL REGARDLESS OF WHICH, FRONT OR REAR, POSITION.     SHOULD NOT FORD MOTOR COMPANY BE MANDATED TO AT LEAST INSPECT THESE PARTS FOR CORROSION IN OTHER THAN THE COMMON POINT OF FAILURE, AND IF NECESSARY REPLACE THEM?

BECAUSE I HAD SOME SNOW BUILD-UP ON THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL, I FIGURED THE LIGHT GRINDING NOISE WAS FROM THE BUILDUP.  WHEN I PULLED UNTO THE STREET AND REACHED HIGHER SPEEDS (ABOUT 45), THE NOISE STOPPED LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNOW HAD FALLEN OFF.  AFTER ABOUT 4 MILES OF DRIVING, I REACHED THE LOCATION I WAS GOING TO.  I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND NOTICED THE BACK END SAGGING.  I KEPT WALKING AROUND MY CAR TO GET MY 22 MONTH OLD SON OUT WHEN I REALIZED I HAD A FLAT TIRE.  AFTER TAKING THE TIRE OFF TO REPLACE IT WITH THE SPARE, I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE TIRE.  A GROVE HAD FORMED PERFECTLY AROUND THE LOWER WALL OF THE TIRE.  I TOOK THE TIRE IN TO BE REPLACED AND ASKED THAT THEY CHECK OUT THE CAUSE.  AFTER BEING REASSURED THAT IT WAS OKAY BUT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY, I DROVE 2 MILES HOME.  ONCE AT HOME THE TIRE WAS REMOVED AGAIN ONLY TO AGAIN SEE THE DEEP GROVE IN A BRAND NEW TIRE.  CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE CAR RESULTED IN FINDING A BROKEN COIL SPRING THE HAD BEEN RUBBING ON THE TIRE AND HAD CAUSE RAPID AIR DEFLATION AFTER NO MORE THAN 4 MILES OF DRIVING.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TIRE, THE COIL SPRINGS, AND THE REAR STRUTS HAD TO BE REPLACED AT THE TUNE OF NEARLY $700.    I WAS THANKFUL THAT I HAD FORGOT TO TAKE OUT ALL THE WARM WINTER CLOTHES OUT OF MY CAR THAT WE HAD USED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO GO SLEDDING; I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY SON WARM ON A COLD AND FRIDGED DAY WHERE I WAS TRAPPED WITH A FLAT.  *JB",

UPON LOOKING AT THE VEHICLE I REALIZED THE BACK SPRING BROKE.  KNOWING THAT THE FRONT SPRINGS ARE COVERED UNDER A RECALL I ASSUMED THERE WAS ONE ALSO ON THE REAR.  I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY TOWED THE VEHICLE TO PRINCE FREDERICK FORD.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEY ASSURED ME THEY WOULD FIX IT AND TRY TO DETERMINE WHY IT BROKE.  ALSO THEY SAID HALF OF THE LABOR WOULD BE TO DO A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT.  ON APRIL 14, 2005 I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS READY.  AFTER PAYING FOR IT THEY TOLD ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS FIXED.  UPON LEAVING THE PARKING LOT I NOTICED THE CAR WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND NOW THERE WAS A SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR (ESPECIALLY WHEN HITTING BUMPS).  DUE TO A FAMILY EMERGENCY I WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT THE DEALER UNTIL MONDAY THE 18TH.  THEY TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK AND IT WOULD BE CHECKED OUT.  ON THE 21ST WE WERE TOLD THE CAR WAS READY AGAIN.  THE ALIGNMENT WAS NOT COMPLETED INITIALLY SO THEY FIXED THAT ISSUE AND THEN DISCOVERED THE REAR STRUTS WERE BAD AND REPLACED THEM.  AT THIS TIME THEY ALSO SAID THEY INSPECTED THE OTHER SPRING AND IT LOOKED FINE.  THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY, MAY 13, 2005 WHEN I AGAIN PLACED MY DAUGHTER IN HER CAR SEAT (WHICH WE MOVED TO THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR SEAT) THE RIGHT (PASSENGER) SIDE SPRING BROKE.  AFTER CALLING FORD TO SEE WHY IT BROKE WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS FINE, THEY SAID THEY COULD BE OF NO FURTHER HELP TO US. I DO HAVE THE SPRING THAT BROKE TODAY (IT'S STILL ON THE CAR, UNTIL I CAN HAVE IT FIXED) BUT THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T GIVE ME THE FIRST ONE.  MY CONCERN IS WITH THERE BEING A RECALL ON THE FRONT SPRINGS DUE TO CORROSION BY ROAD SALTS IN MY STATE, WHAT MAKES THE REAR ANY DIFFERENT?  IT IS AN ODD OCCURANCE FOR ONE SPRING TO BREAK BUT FOR BOTH TO BREAK I THINK THERE IS A BIGGER PROBLEM.",

AFTER WORK, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR 2 MILES TO A GARAGE FOR REPAIRS, ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT POWER STEERING.  THE GARAGE STATED THAT THE REASON THE SERPENTINE BELT BROKE WAS THAT THE BEARINGS IN THE AIR CONDITIONING CLUTCH WERE SEIZED WHICH CAUSED THE  CLUTCH TO LOCK UP.  THIS CAUSED TREMENDOUS FRICTION ON THE SERPENTINE BELT CAUSING IT TO BREAK.  THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THE AIR CONDITIONING CLUTCH WITH THE SEIZED BEARINGS & ALSO STATED THAT THE BOLT THAT HOLDS THE CLUTCH TO THE ENGINE WAS ABOUT TO COME OFF & THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE CLUTCH TO COME OFF THE ENGINE.  THE SHOP MANAGER STATED THAT THIS PROBLEM SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A VEHICLE WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MILES ON IT, BUT HE HAD NOTICED THIS PROBLEM LATELY WITH NEWER MODEL FORDS.  THIS PROBLEM DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AS I LOST POWER STEERING WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NOT MOVING.  I AM ALSO A MUSCULAR MAN, SO I WAS ABLE TO STEER THE VEHICLE AT LOW SPEEDS WORTH GREAT DIFFICULTY.  HOWEVER, IF THIS HAD HAPPENED AT A HIGHWAY SPEED WITH MY WIFE OR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER DRIVING, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE & WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CRASHED POTENTIALLY CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

TAKEN TO GARAGE 2 BLKS AWAY AND FOUND BOTH REAR SPRINGS HAVE BROKEN, APPEARED TO HAVE RUSTED THROUGH AND RIGHT REAR TIRE DESTROYED.  TO REPLACE THE SPINGS THE STUTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  SO 2 NEW SPRINGS, 2 NEW STURTS AND ONE NEW TIRE = $800.  I DO NOT HAVE MY VIN# WITH ME NOW BUT CAN GIEV IT TO YOU TOMORROW.    THIS CAR HAS 55K MILES ON IT, NICE EASY MILES.  I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER CARS 200K+ MILES BEFORE I HAVE HAD  A SPRING FAIL.  NOW I'M OUT $800 AND FORD SAYS THEY ARE ONLY LIABLE FOR  THE FRONT SPRINGS!  PLEASE, PLEASE EXPAND YOUR RECALL NOTICE #4V332000 TO INCLUDE THE REAR SUSPENSION. AFTER REVIEWING OTHER COMPLAINTS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  I MEAN REALLY, BROKEN SPRINGS THAT ARE 3-4 YEARS OLD WITH ONLY 20-50K MILES ON THEM??  PLEASE CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, IF THEY HAD FAILED ON THE HIGHWAY I'M SURE I WOULD HAVE HAD BOTH TIRES PUNCTURED AND MY WIDOW WOULD BE LOOKING AT CASKETS RIGHT NOW.       I AM PICKING UP THE CAR TOMORROW, FIRDAY 8/20, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SAVE THE PARTS FOR YOUR REVIEW?  WOULD YOU LIKE SOMEONE TO TAKE MY DEPOSITION?  I KNOW IT'S TOO LATE TO GET MY $800 BACK BUT WHY SHOULD OTHERS HAVE TO SUFFER THAT COME AFTER ME, AND YOU KNOW THEY WILL.

SINCE THE LATEST REPAIR (AT 50,000 MILES) IS NOW ALLEGEDLY OUT OF WARRANTY THE DEALER WANT $140 TO FIX THE PROBLEM AGAIN.  AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT CONTINUE TO RESURFACE.  I ARGUED WITH THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER (FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS) THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND A DEFECT, NOT A NEW PROBLEM.  THE BARS SHOULD NOT BE COMING LOOSE ON THEIR OWN.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE SECOND REPAIR ATTEMPT (AT 16,000 MILES) THE DEALER INSTALLED A SPECIAL KIT THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM FORD TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT THE MANUFACTURER AND THE DEALER ARE AWARE OF A GENERALIZED PROBLEM AND THAT SWAY BARS ARE COMING LOOSE ON THIS CAR MODEL (2001 TAURUS SES) AND PERHAPS ON MANY OTHERS THAT SHARE THE SAME SWAY BAR DESIGN.

A SIMILAR PROBLEM OCCURRED A MONTH PRIOR, WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHIFT FROM O/D INTO D OR 1.  THE DEALERSHIPS SOLUTION WAS TO FORCEFULLY RAISE AND LOWER THE SHIFTER THROUGH ALL OF THE GEARS.   SHIFTER IS COLUMN MOUNTED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.*AKY",

THIS WAS REPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO HAS BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION \"IN THE HOPES\" THAT THIS WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM BUT IT DID NOT. WHEN I INFORMED THE DEALERSHIP OF THIS, THEY CLAIMED THAT THE \"JUMPING BACK\" PROBLEM WAS NORMAL VEHICLE OPERATION. THIS DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE SINCE THEY ADMITTED IT WAS A PROBLEM PREVIOUSLY AND TRIED TO CORRECT IT BY REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION. PROBLEM #2: THE DRIVER-SIDE SEAT BELT TIGHTENS BY ITSELF AROUND THE LAP WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS RESULTING IN A RESTRICTION OF NORMAL MOVEMENT INSIDE THE CAR. THE SEATBELT HAS, ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS \"LOCKED-UP\" WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION, PREVENTING ME FROM TURNING TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER FOR ON-COMING TRAFFIC TO MAKE A LANE CHANGE ON THE HIGHWAY. THE DEALERSHIP TRIED TO FIX THIS BY REPLACING THE SEATBELT. WHEN I INFORMED THEM THAT THE TIGHTENING PROBLEM STILL EXISTED, THEY SAID THAT THE SEATBELT TENSION WAS NORMAL. THIS AGAIN DOES NOT MATCH WHAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID AND ACTED ON BY REPLACING THE SEATBELT IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

THE STRANGE PART IS WHEN I PHONED THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM, THEY GAVE ME INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SHIFT THE GEAR AS IF IT WAS PART OF MY OWNER'S MANUAL.  I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE TAURUS VEHICLE.  WHEN THE SERVICE DEPARMENT AT FORD WEST PULLED THE INFORMATION UP ON THE CAR FROM THE COMPUTER, IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE CAR'S REAR BUMPER HAD BEEN REPLACED WHEN IT HAD 5 MILES ON IT. (THIS WAS NEVER DISCLOSED TO ME). I PICKED UP THE CAR DROVE HOME AND THE BRAKE SWITCH WENT OUT AGAIN.  THIS TIME I CALLED CHINO HILLS FORD TO HAVE THEM REPLACE THE BRAKE SWITCH. I DROVE THE CAR TO CHINO HILLS ON APRIL 12, 2001, I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE SERVICE PERSONNEL THAT THERE WERE LOOSE WIRES AND I HAD NO BRAKE LIGHTS.  ALL OF THIS WAS ASSESSED BY HIM WITHOUT TAKING THE VEHICLE INTO THE SERVICE AREA.  CHINO HILLS SUPPLIED ME WITH A RENTAL AND SAID IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A DAY TO REPAIR. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DEALERSHIP WOULD CHECK THE CAR THOROUGHLY SINCE THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURED MORE THAN ONCE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME OF PURCHASING THE VEHICLE. WHEN DRIVING THE CAR I COULD FEEL THAT THE BRAKES WERE STILL NOT WORKING PROPERLY, SO I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ONLY TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT TAKING MY CONCERNS SERIOUSLY.  TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THE BRAKES FAILED TWICE ON THE CAR.  TWO ENGINEERING COMPANIES INVESTIGATED AND FOUND OIL IN THE BRAKE LINE.  NOW FORD DOES NOT WANT TO COMPENSATE ME WITH A NEW CAR AND OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR A RENTAL.  A MORE DETAILED LETTER HAS BEEN SENT TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY, PRODUCT CLAIM DEPARTMENT.

THE HARDER A PRESSED ON THE BRAKE THE GREATER THE ACCELLERATION.  AS I SAID, I HAD NO IDEA MY RIGHT FOOT WAS ON BOTH PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO CLARKE FORD FOR THEIR INSPECTION.  THEY PERFORMED THAT INSPECTION ON 8/21 AND REPORTED NO APPARENT PROBLEMS.  I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT EVENING TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE.  THE SALESMAN AND I TOOK A TEST DRIVE TO SEE IF I COULD REPLICATE WHAT I HAD EXPERIECED ON THE 19TH.  COULDN'T DO IT SO I DROVE MY OTHER VEHICLE HOME AND THE SALESMAN FOLLOWED ME HOME IN THE NEW VEHICLE.  THE SALESMAN DROVE ME BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND AS HE PROCEDED INTO A PARKING SPACE HE BRAKED TO STOP THE CAR BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE CAR WANTED TO ACCELERATE JUST AS HAD HAPPENED TO ME ON THREE OCCASSIONS.  THE STARTLED SALESMAN EXCLAIMED \"IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU\" AND HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS WHICH WAS ON BOTH THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR.  MYSTERY SOLVED.  THIS HAD NEVER HAPPENED WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED OR LEASED IN 43 YEARS OF DRIVING.  I INSPECTED THE POSITION OF THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR PEDALS IN MY OTHER TWO CARS AND A COUPLE OF CO-WORKERS CARS AND DISCOVERED THAT THE DISTANCES, BOTH DEPTH AND WIDTH, ON THE NEW TAURUS WERE MUCH CLOSER THAN THE OTHER VEHICLES.  ON THE NEW TAURUS, I CAN DEPRESS THE BRAKE WITH MY HAND AND IT WILL DESEND TO A LEVEL LOWER THAN THE ACCELERATOR.  I COULD NOT DO THIS IN THE OTHER VEHICLES, EVEN BY USING MY FOOT TO BRAKE.  THE BRAKE PEDAL NEVER GOT TO THE LEVEL OF THE ACCELERATOR.  I BELIEVE THE FORD NEW DESIGN, WHICH IS A POWER ADJUSTABLE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR PEDAL BAR TO ACCOMODATE SHORT STATURED PEOPLE, COULD BE A DEFECT WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS, SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT OCCURED IN THE JEEP A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.",
