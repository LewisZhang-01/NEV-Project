I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER, LET THE ENGINE COOL, ADDED OIL AND THEN WAITED A BIT LONGER TO ENSURE IT HAD COOLED SUFFICIENTLY.  I RESTARTED THE CAR, PUT IN IN DRIVE AND WENT ABOUT 20 FT BEFORE THE TEMPERATURE SHOT BACK UP AGAIN.  I PARKED IT IMMEDIATELY, CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC.  THE REPAIR REQUIRES REPLACING THE ENGINE AND WILL COST IS EQUIVALENT TO THE CAR'S VALUE.

IT WAS BURROWING THROUGH THE DIRT AND SPEWING OUT DIRT LIKE WE WERE IN A TORNADO.  I STEERED THE CAR ALONG THE CHURCH FENCE TO PREVENT IT FROM GOING INTO THE STREET.  AFTER A WHILE IT CRASHED INTO THE CHURCH'S FENCE AND SLOWED FOR A FEW SECONDS.  (A WITNESS REPORTED HE RAN AFTER THE CAR TO GET THE LICENSE PLATE.)  THEN THE CAR REVVED UP AGAIN AND SPUN TO THE LEFT AND PROCEEDED FORWARD A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN PLOWED INTO THE BLOCK WALL GOING DOWN TO THE LOWER PARKING LOT.

THE BEST FIX SO FAR REPORTED IS PURCHASING ANOTHER TOYOTA 4CYL MOTOR WITH THE SAME FLAWED ENGINEERING AND TOYOTA WANTS NO PART OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SHORT COMING. , THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AND TO KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY INSTANCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND YET THIS COMPANY REFUSES TO DO THE RIGHT AND  RESPONSIBLE ACTION AND ISSUE A RECALL TO FIX THEIR FAILURE. ANY AND ALL THE ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER IS NEEDED.  *TR",

I INDICATED THAT WATER LEAK WILL CAUSE ISSUE. HOWEVER, THE DEALER REFUSED TO FIX IT AND TOLD ME THERE WON'T BE SUCH ISSUE.     I TOOK MY KID TO DRIVING TEST TODAY (4/16) WITH THIS VEHICLE. ONLY THEN THAT I FOUND OUT FROM THE DRIVING EXAMINER THAT BRAKE LIGHT IS NOT WORKING AND HE REFUSED TO LET MY KID PROCEED WITH HER DRIVING TEST CITING SAFETY ISSUE. THIS IS DEFINITELY VERY FRUSTRATING NOT TO MENTION THE FEW HOURS WASTED IN DMV.    WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN HEAVY RAIN ON AND OFF OVER THE 2 WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT THAT CAR. THE WATER DID INDEED GO INTO THE LAMP CASE AND CAUSE THE HOT LIGHT BULB TO BURST. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO WHEEL WORKS TO FIX THIS ISSUE TODAY AND THE MECHANICS CONFIRMED THE ABOVE EXPLANATION. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR ON FREEWAY TO WORK EVERYDAY WITH A BROKEN BRAKE LIGHT AND WITHOUT KNOWING THAT. I COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED A TICKET, OR SOMEONE COULD HAVE RUN INTO ME ON FREEWAY BECAUSE OF THE FAILED BRAKE LIGHT.    AFTER DRIVING 20 YEARS OF TOYOTA VEHICLE, I AM COMPLETELY SHOCKED THAT TOYOTA DEALER CHEATED ME ON SAFETY ISSUE. SIMPLY SPEAKING, TOYOTA TRADED HIS BEST CUSTOMERS' LIFE FOR FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE DEALER THOUGH WILLING TO PAY FOR THE BULB (WHICH IS A CHEAP $5) AND WAIVE THE LABOR COST, SIMPLY REFUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEARING THE COST OF THE LAMP CASE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT SEE THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE AND HAD THIS ISSUE FIXED TO BEGIN WITH BEFORE DELIVERING THE CAR TO CUSTOMER.    I DO ASK THAT TOYOTA REIMBURSE ME THE SAME FULL PART AND LABOR COST THAT THEY WERE TO CHARGE THIS REPAIR TO CUSTOMERS.          *JS",

THIS CONSTANT SNAGGING OF THE CONVERTIBLE TOP ON THIS HARD PLASTIC LIP CAUSES TWO ISSUES:  1) THE PLASTIC 'LIP' ITSELF IS WEAKENED, LOSES INTEGRITY, SUFFERS A FATIGUE CRACK, AND BREAKS.  2) THE STITCHING OF THE CONVERTIBLE TOP AT THE TOP OF THE BACK WINDOW LOSES ITS INTEGRITY, AND THE BACK WINDOW BECOMES SEPARATED FROM THE CONVERTIBLE TOP.  THIS RESULTS IN A GAP BETWEEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP AND THE TOP OF THE BACK WINDOW, WHICH CAN (AND DID, IN MY CASE) RESULT IN THE WINDOW CATCHING ON THE BACK OF THE SEAT AND COMPLETELY SHATTERING.    WHEN MY WINDOW SHATTERED, I TOOK IT TO A REPAIR SHOP.  THE PERSON THERE TOLD ME HE HAS FREQUENTLY SEEN THIS ISSUE WITH MY MODEL OF SOLARA (UP TO YEAR 2003) SOLELY DUE TO THE LIP AT THE TOP OF THE SEAT BACK ITS ALWAYS SNAGGING THE CONVERTIBLE ROOF WITH EACH OPENING OR CLOSING.  HE TOLD ME THAT THIS DESIGN FLAW WAS CORRECTED IN THE REDESIGNED TOYOTA SOLARA THAT WAS RELEASED IN 2004, AND ALL SUBSEQUENT MODEL YEARS.  FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE, THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  FOR THOSE, LIKE ME, WHO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE, THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO PAY FOR.    I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AS A CONSUMER, AND FEEL TOYOTA SHOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM -- AT NO CHARGE -- OF ALL EFFECTED MODELS.  THE REPAIR IS SIMPLE: THEY NEED ONLY CUT AWAY THE LIP FROM THE SEAT BACK, AS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE BACK SEAT, ITSELF, AS SHOWN BY ITS DISAPPEARANCE IN THE LATER MODELS.  *TR",

ESSENTIALLY, THE DEALERSHIP WANTS TO SWAP OUT ONE DEFECTIVE THROTTLE BODY FOR ANOTHER DEFECTIVE THROTTLE BODY.  SIMILARLY, TOYOTA CORPORATE IN TORRANCE, CA DENIES THAT THE THROTTLE BODY PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY A PRODUCT DEFECT.

MY UNCLE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO CHECK THAT; SO SHE HAD MY SISTER CHECK ONLINE WHO FOUND THAT HER CAR WAS NOT UNDER RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE MOTHER HAD IT CHECKED OUT AT AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP.  SINCE DEALERSHIPS ARE TYPICALLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOPS, WE BELIEVE SHE HAD THE CAR CHECKED OUT AT THE LATTER.  THIS WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO. ON MAY 2, 2011, SHE WAS KILLED IN A SINGLE AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT.  WHEN WE RECEIVED THE POLICE REPORT, IT SAID THE WITNESSES SAID THE CAR SEEMED TO ACCELERATE WHEN IT LEFT THE CITY STREET.  SINCE SHE WAS COMING UP TO A STOP SIGN, SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOING BETWEEN 15-25 MPH, BUT THE CAR WAS TOTALED, AND THE POLICE OFFICER SAID THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTS THAT SHE ACCELERATED.  THE WAY I INTERPRET THE POLICE REPORT DRAWING IS THAT MOTHER TRIED TO AVOID A COLLISION TWICE:  IT APPEARS TO ME THAT SHE MAY HAVE SWERVED TO THE LEFT LANE TO AVOID HITTING THE REAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF HER AND, SEEING THE CAR IN THE OPPOSITE LANE COMING TOWARD HER, SHE MAY HAVE SWERVED AGAIN, WHICH TOOK HER OFF THE STREET AND DIRECTLY, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, IN THE PATH TO THE TREE WHICH SHE HIT WITH GREAT FORCE.  ACCORDING TO PARAMEDICS, SHE PROBABLY NEVER HAD CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER IMPACT, SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED FOR SURE.  THE HOSPITAL ER PHYSICIAN REPORTED IN ERROR TO THE POLICE THAT MOTHER HAD BRAIN CANCER AND MAY HAVE HAD SOME SORT OF EVENT (BLOOD CLOT BURSTING IN HER BRAIN).  SHE DID NOT HAVE BRAIN CANCER, AND FROM WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM SPEAKING WITH MY PHYSICIAN, IT IS VERY RARE THAT AN EVENT CAUSING A PERSON'S LEG TO STIFFEN FORCING ACCELERATION.  ADD ALL THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT THIS ACCIDENT COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT SHE HAD COMPLAINED OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION LEADS US TO WONDER ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.   *TR",

MY WIFE'S CAMRY (2003 WITH JUST UNDER 100,000 MILES) DEVELOPED A LEAK IN ITS HEAD GASKET, SO I TOOK IT INTO OUR LOCAL GARAGE. THEY LOOKED AT IT (PRESSURE TEST) CONFIRMED IT WAS LEAKING AND WENT ON LINE (IDENTIFIX.COM) TO SEE WHAT EXPERIENCES OTHER MECHANICS HAD WITH THIS PROBLEM AND RECOMMENDED FIXES. THE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS BEING REPORTED FREQUENTLY AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ALSO RESULTED IN A MORE SEVERE PROBLEM OF STRIPPING THE ENGINE BOLTS OUT OF THE BLOCK, REQUIRING AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT. MY MECHANIC SAID I WOULD BE BEST OFF TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED THE CAR AND HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT, BECAUSE IF IT WAS MORE THAN JUST THE HEAD GASKET, I MAY BE ABLE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH THEM. IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT A LEAK IN THE HEAD GASKET SHOULDN'T CAUSE THE STRIPPING OF THE ENGINE BOLTS.     WE TOOK IT INTO OUR TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY INVESTIGATED - TOOK THE HEAD OFF - AND FOUND THAT IT WAS WHAT MY MECHANIC HAD FEARED, THREE ENGINE BOLTS WERE STRIPPED AND THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. COST FOR A NEW ENGINE BLOCK, HEAD, LABOR, ETC. $7,500.     I TOLD THEM WHAT MY MECHANIC HAD FOUND ONLINE - THIS WAS HAPPENING A LOT TO THIS TYPE ENGINE (2003 - 6) - AND MY BELIEF THAT THIS WAS A DESIGN FLAW AND ASKED THEM IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT TOYOTA COULD DO TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST OR WAS THERE A RECALL, ETC. THE SERVICE REP SAID NO... NO HELP FROM TOYOTA.     I HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK AND CAN YOU SEND YOU COPIES, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFIX REPORT. CONSIDERING ALL THE PRESSURE PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT, AND LAWYERS HAD TO EXERT ON TOYOTA TO GET THEM TO ADMIT AND ADDRESS THE RECENT ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD CHECK OR ADD MY CASE TO A DATABASE TO SEE IF SOME LEGAL ACTION IS WARRANTED.  *TR",

I LIVE IN OREGON WHERE WE HAVE SEASONS SO IT ONLY GETS HOT A FEW MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR AND I USE A SUN VISOR DURING THE SUMMER FOR PROTECTION.  IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF MY CAR WHERE THE AIRBAG IS IN THE DASH, THE RECTANGULAR INDENTATION (LIKE A SEAM) AROUND THE AIRBAG HAS COMPLETELY SEPARATED AT THE TOP EXPOSING YELLOW FOAM AND HAS ME VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ANY PASSENGERS OR EVEN MYSELF OR OTHERS ON THE ROAD SHOULD THE AIRBAG DEPLOY.  MY FATHER IS TERMINALLY ILL WITH CANCER AND ONLY WEIGHS ABOUT 115 POUNDS AND I HAVE TO DRIVE HIM TO DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS REGULARLY.  I WAS SO CONCERNED WHEN I FIRST NOTICED WHAT I CALL A \"DESIGN FLAW\" THAT I MADE HIM RIDE IN THE BACK SEAT.  HOWEVER, SINCE HE IS SO THIN, HE WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE BACK AND WANTED TO RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT AGAIN WHICH I ALLOWED HIM TO DO AFTER THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP IN MEDFORD (LITHIA MOTORS, INC) GUARANTEED ME \"100%\" THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE BUT IS PURELY COSMETIC.  I HAVE PROVIDED PROOF OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS TO LITHIA AND HAVE SPOKEN TO TOYOTA CORPORATE A FEW TIMES.  THEY STILL INSIST IT IS ONLY COSMETIC AND I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE ENTIRE DASH AT A COST OF OVER $2,000.00.  I MAINTAIN THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY ON SAFETY (PER THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS) AND ARE SPENDING EVEN MORE ON PR, THEY CAN DO A \"GOOD WILL\" REPAIR FOR A LOYAL CUSTOMER.  TO THEIR CREDIT, I SHOULD ADD THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY 50% TO REPAIR THE DASH, BUT IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE \"UNREPAIRABLE\" BY THEIR UPHOLSTERY PERSON.  I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM FOR MONTHS NOW.  I AM A VERY PRINCIPLE BASED PERSON AND BELIEVE THIS IS WRONG CONSIDERING THE AGE, MILEAGE, ETC AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED AT THEIR EXPENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN OTHERS HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM.

WE SPENT AT 4-5 HOURS IN THE ER OF THE HOSPITAL WHERE WE WERE X-RAYED. EVEN AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, SOME 2 MONTHS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BOTH MY WIFE AND I REMAIN EXTREMELY SHAKEN BY THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. MY WIFE'S SPINAL PROBLEMS WERE ENHANCED BY THE CRASH, AND HER CONDITION IS BEING MONITORED BY SPECIALISTS. THE CAR WAS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST.. I SUSPECT THE ORIGINAL MICRO CHIP TO CAUSE THE MALFUNCTION OF THE GAS FLOW. *TR",

I PASSED THE ENTRANCE GATE, MADE TWO 90 DEGREES TURNS AND POSITIONED CAR BETWEEN PARKING LINES. SUDDENLY, I HEARD A HORRIFIED SOUND COMING OUT FROM THE ENGINE: MOTOR WAS ROARING LIKE A WILD LION. I PRESSED THE BRAKE BUT IT DID NOT PREVENT THE ACCIDENT. LIKE A ROCKET THE VEHICLE RAN OVER THE CURB AND LANDSCAPING COLLIDING INTO A LARGE THREE.  THE SEAT BELT SAVED MY LIFE, HOWEVER THE WHOLE FRONT BODY OF THE VEHICLE WAS SMASHED AND THE ESTIMATED DAMAGE WAS NEAR $8,000. THE BECHTEL SECURITY GUARD OFFICER WAS CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY. THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AND RECORDED IN BECHTEL SECURITY FILE. LATER THIS YEAR WHEN TOYOTA \"UNINTENDED ACCELERATION\" PROBLEM WAS REVEALED I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA MOTOR SALES DEPARTMENT. THEY INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND DETERMINED THAT ALL TESTS PERFORMED SAFELY. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, THE FOLLOWING ATTACHMENTS HAVE BEEN MAILED TO YOUR OFFICE ON MARCH 24, 2010:  A COPY OF MY LETTER SUBMITTED TO TOYOTA MOTOR SALES, U.S.A., TORRANCE, CA.

HE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED COOLANT LEAKING FROM UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLD IN THE REAR OF THE ENGINE. HE ALSO NOTICED A LARGE PIECE OF FOAM RUBBER BETWEEN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE ENGINE BLOCK AND HEAD. THIS WAS BLOCKING OUR VIEW OF THE LEAK. WE COULD ONLY SEE THAT THE LEAK WAS BEHIND THE FOAM PIECE. THE ONLY OPTION TO DISCOVER THE SOURCE OF THIS LEAK WAS TO REMOVE THE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLD, WHICH I DID. AFTER THIS WAS REMOVED, IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT COOLANT HAD BEEN LEAKING A MINOR AMOUNT FOR QUITE SOME TIME DUE TO BUILD UP BETWEEN THE CYLINDER HEAD AND BLOCK. THE ONLY OPTION LEFT IS TO REMOVE THE HEAD, WHICH REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE DISASSEMBLY (R AND R CYLINDER HEAD). AFTER LOOSENING THE BOLTS IN SEQUENCE, HE NOTICED THE HEAD BOLTS IN THE BACK OF THE ENGINE WERE LOOSE. FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD, HE CAN CONFIDENTLY CONCLUDE THAT THIS ONLY MEANS ONE OF TWO THINGS: THE BOLTS WERE LEFT LOOSE AT THE FACTORY, OR THE BOLTS ARE STRIPPED. ( HE COMMONLY HAS SEEN STRIPPED BOLTS IN THE ALUMINUM CADILLAC NORTH STAR BLOCK DISCOVERED THROUGH LEAKING COOLANT.)NEXT, HE REMOVED THE HEAD AND SURE ENOUGH, ONE BOLT CAME OUT WITH ALUMINUM IN THE THREAD...THUS INDICATING A STRIPPED BOLT. THE PLACEMENT OF THE (INSULATION) FOAM RUBBER PIECE BETWEEN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE ENGINE BLOCK CREATED AN UNEVEN DISPERSION OF HEAT, CREATING \"METAL FATIGUE\" IN THE ALUMINUM BLOCK ALLOWING THE HEADBOLT TO STRIP. IF TOYOTA HAD OUT AN ALUMINUM MANIFOLD INSTEAD OF PLASTIC, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED TO INSULATE (W/ FOAM PIECE), THUS ELIMINATING THE PROBLEM. THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO UNFORTUNATELY REPLACE THE ENGINE. THE COST TO REPAIR IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. THIS IS AN ENGINE DEFECT AND WE WILL BE SEEING MORE OF THIS.  *TW",

ONE WEEK LATER, WE EXPERIENCED ANOTHER INCIDENT IN WHICH THE BRAKES FAILED TO DEPLOY CORRECTLY, CAUSING US TO FEEL UNSAFE AT A STOP LIGHT IN TIGHT TRAFFIC.  WE TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A SECOND INSPECTION.  A TOYOTA TECHNICIAN TOOK ME FOR A TEST RIDE AND SAID THEY HAD RECEIVED COMPLAINTS OF \"SOFT, CUSHY\" BRAKES, BUT THAT WHENEVER TESTED, THESE BRAKES MET THE TOYOTA SPECIFICATIONS.  AGAIN, WE WERE DISSATISFIED AND FELT THAT OUR SAFETY WAS COMPROMISED IN THIS CAR.  WE CONTACTED TOYOTA'S CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT.  AN ACCIDENT REPORT WAS TAKEN OVER THE TELEPHONE.  WE WERE GIVEN NO FURTHER HELP.  WE RECONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND REQUESTED THAT THE DISTRICT TECHNICIAN TAKE OUR CAR FOR A TEST RIDE.  ON 4/4/08, THE TECHNICIAN AND THE SERVICE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP TOOK THE CAR OUT ON A TEST RIDE.  THEY INFORMED US THAT THE ABS BRAKES MET TOYOTA'S SPECIFICATIONS.    DESPITE THE DEALERSHIPS ASSURANCES, MY HUSBAND HAD A THIRD INCIDENT RECENTLY IN TRAFFIC WHERE THE BRAKES FAILED ONCE AGAIN.  WE FEAR FOR OUR SAFETY IN THIS CAR AND DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE IT IN TRAFFIC OR OTHERWISE.  *TR",

THE CRACKS PROGRESSED WITH TIME BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO BRING IT UP TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE SPEAKERS ARE LOCATED IN A PLACE I DO NOT NORMALLY LOOK AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE ONLY CHEAP PLASTIC COVERS. BY 2006 THE PLASTIC WAS ACTUALLY DISINTEGRATING AND FALLING INTO THE LOUDSPEAKER ASSEMBLY CREATING AN EVER BIGGER BLACK HOLE. THE DEALER POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THIS PROBLEM EXISTS ON CAMRYS AND THAT YOU MUST REPLACE THE WHOLE BACK PANEL BEHIND THE BACK SEATS NOT JUST THE PLASTIC COVER FOR $450 PLUS LABOR. I WAS TOLD THAT OTHER TOYOTAS DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM SINCE THEY USE A DIFFERENT VENDOR FOR THE SPEAKER COVERS. SINCE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY TOYOTA DECLINED TO REPLACE THE COVERS.

I HAVE DISCOVERED CAMRYS IN PARKING LOTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. IT NOW APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PROBLEM IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WHICH TOYOTA FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO NEW CAMRY BUYERS. THE TOYOTA DEALER ALSO FAILED TO DISCLOSE THIS PROBLEM WHENEVER THEY INSPECT THE CAR, INCLUDING THE INTERIOR, DURING SERVICE.    I AM REQUESTING THAT TOYOTA REPAIR MY CAMRY AND RETURN IT TO ITS ORIGINAL APPEARANCE. I AM RECOMMENDING THAT A FINE BE LEVIED ON TOYOTA FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE A KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT TO NEW AND USED CAMRY BUYERS. I BELIEVE TOYOTA SHOULD RECALL ALL 2002-2004 CAMRYS. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED FOR THE PUBLIC'S POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR TO FINE PARTICLES/GASSES FROM THIS DISINTEGRATING PLASTIC AND EXPOSURE TO TODDLERS WHO PLACE THEIR HANDS IN THE LOUDSPEAKERS AND THEN EAT POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIAL.

EXCESSIVE HEAT ( THE MAX TEMPERATURE ON THIS MONTH-JUNE WAS AROUND 95+) SO THEY MEAN TO SAY THE DASH-BOARDS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND THAT OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE ?(PROBABLY IT WILL BE LITTLE MORE INSIDE). SO ARE THEY SAYING EXCESSIVE SUMMER HEAT CAN CREATE A GAP BETWEEN DASH-BOARD AND AIR BAG COVER FOR ANY CAR?. AIR BAG IS SUCH A CRITICAL SAFETY PART HOW CAN ALLOW SUCH GAP BETWEEN THE COVER AND DASH-BOARD FOR THE SUMMER HEAT? . I AM PLANNING TO TAKE THIS TO NHTSA TO SEE A PATTERN.

IF THE AIR BAG POPS OUT WHEN I AM DRIVING, IT CAN DEFINITELY DISTRACT ANY DRIVER.  OR IF DUST GETS IN IT CAN MAL-FUNCTION TOO.

HE SAID IT WAS THE ENGINE AND NEEDED TO BE TAKEN TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, AND WE COULD NOT DRIVE IT AT ALL. I TOWED IT TO THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP, APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES AWAY. THEY CHECKED IT OVER COUPLE OF DAYS, THEN CALLED AND SAID THE ENGINE HAD SLUDGE IN IT, AND NEEDED A $7,000-$8,000 REPAIR. THEY ALSO SAID IT WAS MY FAULT, BECAUSE THE OIL HAD OBVIOUSLY NOT BEEN CHANGED PROPERLY. WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR, THE TOYOTA DEALER TALKED ME INTO A $999 EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN, WHICH HE ASSURED ME WOULD COVER ANY MAJOR ISSUES THAT MIGHT COME UP WITH A CAR -- THEIR TENDER LOVING CARE PACKAGE. NOW THE WARRANTY (WHICH TOYOTA IS DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM, SAYING IS AN OUTSIDE COMPANY, THEREFORE NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM) COMPANY DENIED THE REPAIR. ALSO, TOYOTA DENIED COVERING THE REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE RESEARCHED AND FOUND TONS OF MATERIAL ONLINE INDICATING THAT THEY'VE HAD AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE CAMRY ENGINES AND SLUDGE ISSUES.

TWICE I WAS HIT IN THE HEAD OR BACK  WHILE LEANING INTO THE TRUNK AND PUTTING SOMETHING IN OR TAKING SOMETHING OUT, A MAJOR PROBLEM BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS PUTTING IN OR TAKING OUR BABY STROLLER OUT OF THE TRUNK, AND WE WERE AFRAID THE TRUNK MIGHT ALSO CLOSE ON OUR SON'S HAND OR HEAD IF HE WERE STANDING NEARBY.    WE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER; THEY AT FIRST DENIED THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TRUNK.  BUT THE SERVICE MANAGER EVENTUALLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED WITH ME ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  HE ORDERED AND REPLACED THE TORSION BARS IN OUR TRUNK; IT FIXED THE PROBLEM AT THAT TIME.  THIS WAS ONE YEAR AGO.  IN OCTOBER 2005, THE SAME THING STARTED HAPPENING AGAIN.  WHILE THE TRUNK DOESN'T SLAM DOWN ON US YET, IT DOES IDLE HALFWAY UP AND MUST BE PUSHED UP OR DOWN TO LOCK THE POSITION.  WE BROUGHT IT BACK TO OUR TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND ASKED FOR THE SAME SERVICE MANAGER DIRECTLY.  HE REMEMBERED US AND IS GOING TO REPLACE THE TORSION BARS AGAIN, BUT CLAIMED THAT HE HASN'T SEEN THIS PROBLEM HAPPEN IN SEVERAL YEARS; APPARENTLY IT WAS A RECURRING PROBLEM ON OLDER MODELS.  MY MAIN CONCERNS WITH THIS ISSUE ARE THAT FIRST, IT KEEPS ON HAPPENING AND SECONDLY, THIS PAST SUMMER ON LONG ISLAND, NY, TWO YOUNG BOYS WHO WERE MISSING, WERE LATER FOUND DEAD IN THE TRUNK OF A TOYOTA CAMRY ON THEIR STREET.  APPARENTLY THE TRUNK WAS BROKEN AND IT SHUT ON THEM, TRAPPING THEM INSIDE THE VEHICLE DURING A HEAT WAVE.  THE POLICE DIDN'T FIND THEM IN THE CAR UNTIL A FEW DAYS LATER.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE BROKEN TRUNK HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE TORSION BARS THAT WE HAVE, BUT THE NEWS STORY CONCERNED US ENOUGH TO REPORT THIS TO YOU.  *JB",

WITH THE ENGINE OFF AND NO KEY IN THE IGNITION, I CAN SLIDE THE SHIFTER FROM PARK TO ANY OTHER GEAR, WITHOUT PRESSING IN THE SAFETY BUTTON. I CANNOT SLIDE THE SHIFTER BACK INTO PARK. HERE'S HOW I FOUND OUT. I PARKED IN MY DRIVE, PUT THE CAR IN PARK, REMOVED THE KEYS, GRABBED MY SHOPPING BAG AND WENT INSIDE. MY HUSBAND CAME IN A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH SOME SHOCKING NEWS. APPARENTLY, MY CAMRY HAD ROLLED DOWN THE DRIVE, TOOK OUT OUR MAILBOX, WENT ACROSS THE STREET AND STOPPED IN OUR NEIGHBOR'S FRONT YARD. OUR DRIVE IS OVER 100' LONG AND SLOPES DOWN TOWARD THE STREET. I HANDED MY HUSBAND THE KEYS AND HE WENT TO THE CAR.  IT WAS IN DRIVE.   WHAT I CAN FIGURE IS THAT WHEN I GRABBED MY SHOPPING BAG, WHICH WAS FAIRLY HEAVY, I HIT THE SHIFTER AND TOOK THE CAR OUT OF PARK. BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN HOW THE SHIFTER WAS ABLE TO MOVE WITHOUT MY PUSHING IN THE SAFETY BUTTON. I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER RELATIONS IN TORRANCE, AND THEY ARRANGED A SERVICE APPT FOR ME AT THE DEALER.  THE DEALER INDICATED THEY HAD TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT.  DURING A FOLLOW-UP CALL FROM THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP, THEY INDICATED THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE.  WHEN I ASKED IF IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, THE REP SAID IF IT DOES, BRING IT IN.  I WILL TRY VERY HARD TO REMEMBER TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE WHENEVER I PARK MY CAR.  BUT WHAT IF I FORGET?  I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY CAR ROLLING INTO A CHILD, ADULT OR OTHER VEHICLE.  IT IS ONLY DUMB LUCK THAT NO ONE WAS HURT WHEN THE CAR ROLLED DOWN OUR DRIVE.  HAD IT BEEN DAYTIME, THE CHANCES ARE VERY HIGH THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.

TO MY SURPRISE THE ABS BRAKES KICKED IN AND SHUDDERED UNDERFOOT.  I WAS NOT ATTEMPTING A FULL STOP AND HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO STOP SHORT.  I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKES (FOOT WAS NOT ON ANY PEDAL) BUT THE ABS REMAINED ENGAGED AND THERE WAS A SENSE OF BOTH ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION SIMULTANEOUSLY.  I IMMEDIATELY TRIED AGAIN TO ENGAGE THE BRAKES WHEN MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED.   I WAS COMPLETELY SHOCKED BY THIS OCCURRENCE BUT REMAINED CALM WHILE IN DISBELIEF MY CAR BEGAN TO SKID UNCONTROLLABLY AROUND THE EXTREMELY CONGESTED FREEWAY.  AS MY POWER STEERING WAS DISABLED I COULD BARELY AVOID SEVERAL COLLISIONS AS I TRIED TO FIRMLY ENGAGE MY BRAKES.  I PRAYED TO GOD TO WATCH OVER ME AND HELD ON TO THE STEERING WHEEL FOR DEAR LIFE.  MY CAR WAS VEERING BUT NOT SLOWING AS IT SHOULD UNTIL FINALLY MY CAR STRUCK ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THE IMPACT SENT MY CAR INTO A FULL 360 TURN.  FINALLY THE CAR CAME TO A STOP WITH ME FACING ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  MY CAR SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE BUT MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.   NO SAFETY WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON IN MY CAR PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  I AM EXTREMELY LUCKY THAT BOTH THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR AND I WERE ABLE TO WALK OUT OF OUR CARS UNASSISTED AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THOUGH BOTH OF US HAD  NECK/SHOULDER/BACK STRAIN LATER.  NEVADA HIGHWAY PATROL WAS ON SCENE AND TOOK A REPORT.  I HAVE REQUESTED A FULL SAFETY INVESTIGATION AND AM AWAITING RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA CORPORATION. *AK",

THERE WAS NO GRAVEL, DIRT, ICE, ETC OR ANY FOREIGN MATTER ON THE ROADS. THE ROADS WERE ALSO DRY. NO RAIN WAS FALLING.  IN BOTH INCIDENTS THE CAR WAS GONG LESS THAN 30 MPH AND IN BOTH CASES THE CAR WAS DESCENDING A SLIGHT HILL. WHEN THE OPERATOR APPLIED BRAKES THE ABS SYSTEM ACTIVATED AND NO AMOUNT OF BRAKE PEDDLE PRESSURE CHANGED THE STOPPING ABILITY OF THE CAR. KICKBACK THRU THE BRAKE PEDDLE WAS FELT BY ME. THE STOPPING DISTANCE WAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.  IN THE FIRST INCIDENT MY WIFE WAS ALONE IN THE CAR AND COMING DOWN A HILL TO A STOP LIGHT. SHE COULD NOT STOP THE CAR BEFORE THE LIGHT AND HAD TO MAKE A HARD RIGHT HAND TURN TO PREVENT HITTING CARS OR BEING HIT BY CARS THAT WERE GOING 45+ MPH ON THEIR ROAD THRU THE LIGHT.   AT THE INTERSECTION. FORTUNATELY THERE HAD BEEN A BREAK IN TRAFFIC SO WHEN SHE TURNED RIGHT AT THE RED LIGHT THERE WAS A BREAK IN TRAFFIC SO THEREE WAS NO IMPACT.  IN MY SITUATION I WAS DRIVING MY WIFE TO A SHOPPING CENTER AND WAS ALSO COMING DOWN A SLIGHT HILL AND COMING UP BEHIND TRAFFIC WHICH WAS STOPPING AT A STOP SIGN.  I COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE. I WAS GETTING KICKBACK THRU THE BRADE PEDDLE AND THE CAR BRAKES WERE CYCLING ON AND OFF AND THUS I HAD TO SWING AROUND THE CAR AHEAD AND ONTO THE RIGHTHAND SHOULDER  TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR AHEAD AND ALMOST HAD TO CLIMB AN EMBACKMENT TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.

IT TOOK A VISIT AND A COUPLE TELEPHONE CALLS TO TOYOTA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE TO GET THEM TO AGREE TO REPLACE THE CD CHANGER.  EVER SINCE THIS WAS REPLACED, I HAVE HAD NO FURTHER ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE SINCE THEN.  HOWEVER, IN THE CAMRY THAT I HAD AS A LOANER WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS IN ON 7/28/03, THAT VEHICLE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH ITS CD CHANGER AND I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT IT.  THE MOON ROOF HAS HAD ISSUES SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED IN JANUARY 2003.  BASICALLY, IT HAS BEEN LEAKING AND A WATER NOISE IS HEARD WHEN OPERATING THE VEHICLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE RADIO NEEDS TO BE TURNED UP TO DROWN THE SOUND OUT.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS FOR FOUR TIMES.  THE LAST TIME IT WAS IN WAS ON 7/28/2003.  AT THAT POINT OF TIME, THE MOON ROOF WAS NOT EVEN CLOSING COMPLETELY.  TOYOTA FLEW A FIELD TECHNICIAN FROM CALIFORNIA TO KANSAS CITY FOR THE REPAIR.  HE CLAIMS THAT THE REASON FOR THE MOON ROOF NOT CLOSING WAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED WHEN THE HEATED LEATHER SEATS WERE INSTALLED AND THAT CAUSED THE TIMING FOR THE ROOF TO BECOME CORRUPTED.  THE DEALERSHIP NEVER SAW THIS PROBLEM EVER WITH ANY 2002-2003 MODEL CAMRY AND THAT IS WHY A FIELD TECH WAS SENT OUT.  AFTER HE FIXED THE SUNROOF, I WAS ASSURED BY CHARLES EPP, TOYOTA'S REGIONAL MANAGER, THAT MY VEHICLE WAS FULLY REPAIRED AND HE PERSONALLY ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS TESTED FOR WATER ISSUES TOO AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS CORRECTED BY RESETTING THE TIMING.    WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE SHORTLY AFTER THE REPAIR, THE MOON ROOF IS STILL LEAKING AND HAVING WATER NOISES DURING HIGHWAY OPERATIONS DURING RAINSTORMS.
