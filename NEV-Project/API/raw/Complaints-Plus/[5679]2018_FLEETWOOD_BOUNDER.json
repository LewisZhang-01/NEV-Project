The contact stated while the vehicle was parked and the generator was running, the contact inhaled strong fumes, which caused the feeling of nausea. The contact was taken to a local clinic however, the contact declined a checkup from the clinic, due to outrageous fee. The contact stated that the carbon monoxide detectors were inoperable. The RV was taken to the local dealer. The vehicle was diagnosed and the contact was informed that the carbon monoxide detectors needed to be replaced. The RV was currently being repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 18,000.",

        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A 2018 BOUNDER 33C IN FEBRUARY OF 2018. THIS VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING.  AFTER PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE, WE LEARNED THE SUSPENSION WAS NOT ADEQUATE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND THE HIGH CENTER OF GRAVITY WHEN MOVING, GIVING US THE FEELING THAT IT WOULD TIP OVER WHEN ROUNDING CURVES AND ON LOCAL ROADS WHERE IT WOULD ROCK BACK AND FORTH, TO THE EXTENT THAT WHEN MY WIFE FOLLOWED ME TO THE REPAIR SHOP, SHE WAS GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROCKING BACK AND FORTH AND SAID SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE TIRES TO LIFT OFF THE GROUND. THE RV ALSO PORPOISES.    RELATING TO THE SUSPENSION, THERE IS A YELLOW WARNING TAG (SEE ATTACHMENT) ON THE SCREEN DOOR WE WERE NOT TOLD ABOUT BEFORE PURCHASE.  THE WARNING STICKER REVEALS THAT THE WEIGHT LIMIT FOR CARGO ON OUR RV HAS BEEN 'REDUCED' TO 2681 POUNDS AND STATES, 'THE COMBINED WEIGHT OF OCCUPANTS AND CARGO SHOULD NEVER EXCEED: 1,216 KG OR 2,681 POUNDS.'  IT GIVES THE WEIGHT OF A FULL LOAD OF WATER AND STATES THAT THE TONGUE WEIGHT OF A TOWED TRAILER ALSO COUNTS AS CARGO.  IF ALL THE TANKS ARE MAXED OUT AND THERE IS A TOWED VEHICLE, THERE IS APPROXIMATELY 100 POUNDS OF CUSHION, MEANING THAT NEITHER MY WIFE NOR I CAN BOARD THIS VEHICLE SAFELY, LET ALONE OTHER OCCUPANTS AND AMENITIES.      ANOTHER DANGEROUS STATIONARY POSITION IS THE FUEL TANK CONNECTION BECAUSE IT WILL NOT TRIGGER THE AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF AT A GAS PUMP WHEN FUELING AND FUEL KEEPS PUMPING AND OVERFLOWS ON THE GROUND WHICH COULD LEAD TO A FIRE FROM GASOLINE HITTING THE EXHAUST OR SOMEONE THROWING A CIGARETTE NEAR THE RV.    THE DASHBOARD IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ 75% OF THE TIME FROM SUN GLARE (SEE ATTACHMENT AND ARTICLE), MAKING IT DANGEROUS WHEN MOVING, DRIVING IN SCHOOL ZONES , CONSTRUCTION ZONES, AND RESIDENTIAL ZONES.      THESE ARE MANUFACTURER'S DEFECTS, AND WE ARE REQUESTING YOUR HELP IN REQUIRING THE MANUFACTURER TO CORRECT THEM.",
