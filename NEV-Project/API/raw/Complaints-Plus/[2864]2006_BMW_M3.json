I WAS TOLD YES THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL BUT MY VIN# WAS NOT ON THE LIST. I ASKED WHY&HE SAID BECAUSE BMW ONLY RECALLED SO MANY OF THE 2006 325I VEHICLES TO FIX. I SAID THIS IS A VEHICLE DEFECT&BMW ONLY RECALLED CERTAIN ONES? THE ANSWER WAS YES.I DECIDED TO FOLLOW UP WITH BMW USA WHO CONFIRMED A RECALL FOR THE 2006 325I BMW SENSOR MAT&ONCE AGAIN SAID THE RECALL DID NOT INCLUDE MY VIN#. I MADE IT VERY CLEAR OF MY FEELINGS WITH THEIR DECISION TO FIX CERTAIN VEHICLES AND NOT ALL THE VIN#S. I DID FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE COMPUTER & FOUND  OTHER CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PASSENGER SENSOR MAT WARNING LIGHT AND VEHICLE VIN#S WHO ARE NOT ON THE RECALL LIST. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TAKE THIS MATTER INTO CONSIDERATION VERY SERIOUSLY. EVERYDAY DRIVERS TAKE PRECIOUS CARGO INTO THEIR VEHICLES CHILDREN&ADULTS. IF THERE IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT WITH A VEHICLE THEY NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL VIN#S OF THAT YEAR,MAKE&MODEL. THIS RECALL IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR A CERTAIN#OF VEHICLES&EXCLUDING OTHERS. THE RECALL COST FOR BMW IS FAR LESS&AVOIDS A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM IF THE AIR BAG DOES NOT DEPLOY CAUSING INJURY OR DEATH. IF THE SENSOR MAT DOES NOT WORK, THE AIR BAG DOES NOT GO OFF. IT DOES NOT TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO KNOW THE SENSOR MAT IS THE PROBLEM-THE ONE BMW INSTALLED-YET THEY WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING IT.

MY CAR IS A BMW 2006 330I WITH SPORTS SEATS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE CARS LISTED AS BEING DEFECTIVE BY YOUR DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER, BMW STATED THAT THE RECALL IS FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF AIRBAG SENSOR MATTS THAT WERE DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING AND THAT MY CAR'S MATT WAS NOT PART OF THIS BATCH. SINCE MY CAR IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THOSE UNDER THE RECALL, AND IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CARS LISTED IN YOUR REPORT, IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THE FAULTY AIRBAG SENSOR ISSUE GOES BEYOND JUST THE BATCH BMW IS CLAIMING WERE DAMAGED. EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, AND THAT SPECIFIC BATCH OF AIR BAG SENSORS WERE DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING, THEN WHAT'S TO SAY THAT MY AIR BAG SENSOR WASN'T ALSO DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING EVEN IF IT WAS PART OF ANOTHER BATCH. THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION, HOWEVER, WOULD INDICATE THAT THE SENSORS BEING DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING IS FALSE AND THAT THERE IS IN FACT A FLAW WITH THE SENSOR ITSELF. THIS IS EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT BMW PRODUCED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE SENSOR AND THAT MY SENSOR THOUGH NOT PART OF THE SO CALLED DAMAGED BATCH IS ALSO EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS. IF THE CAUSE OF THE FAULTY SENSORS WERE DUE TO BEING DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING THEN WHY NEED TO CREATE AN UPDATED VERSION. THE LOGICAL THING TO DO WOULD BE TO ENSURE THE SAFE DELIVERY OF THE SENSORS, NOT CREATE A NEW VERSION. I'VE OWNED MANY VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME FEATURE AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS. BMW CLAIMING THAT THE SYMPTOMS OF MY SENSOR HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE DAMAGED BATCH IS JUST A COINCIDENCE IS A FAR CRY. AT THE VERY LEAST A NEW INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE. THANK YOU.",

ALSO, WHEN TRYING TO TURN IN ANY DIRECTION, A LOUD GRINDING NOISE WAS HEARD.  AN EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCE OCCURRED WHEN NORMAL BRAKING WAS ATTEMPTED.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER WHO DETERMINED THE STEERING COLUMN WAS FAULTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  ALSO THE BRAKE PADS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND ADJUSTMENTS HAD TO BE MADE TO THE TIRE PRESSURE.  THE DEALER PERFORMED THE NECESSARY WORK, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED, AND CONTINUED TO JERK VIOLENTLY WHILE DRIVING.  UPDATED 03/22/07  *JB  UPDATED 03/30/07",
