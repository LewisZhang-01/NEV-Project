THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN I TURNED ON THE ENGINE WITH ATTEMPT TO MOVE FROM THE BUILDING GARAGE. ALLEGEDLY WARNING SYSTEM MUST BE DESIGNED IN THE BMW X 5. THE WARNING SYSTEM WAS NOT FUNCTIONING, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT. I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH FOOTAGE, IN WHICH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT. ALSO, I CAN DEMONSTRATE, AS YOU CAN SEE ON FOOTAGE, THAT I MADE A FAIR ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE ACCIDENT BY TRYING TO CLOSE SPONTANEOUSLY OPEN TAILGATE, WHICH RE-OPEN AGAIN SPONTANEOUSLY WITHOUT ANY WARNINGS.  THE REAR TAILGATE GLASS EXPLODED IN A PIECES OF NEEDLE AND HALF A DIME SIZE AFTER POSSIBLE MINOR TOUCH OF THE REAR WIPER. IF THE MINOR IMPACT OF THE REAR WIPER TOOK PLACE, IT MUST NOT CAUSE SUCH DISPROPORTIONAL DAMAGES TO THE CAR SUCH AS EXPLOSION OF THE REAR TAILGATE WINDOW. THE PICTURE OF THE DEBRIS ALSO IS AVAILABLE.  THE ARBELLA INSURANCE COMPANY DETERMINED THIS EVENT AS A SIMPLE CAR ACCIDENT, SINCE THE ARBELLA INSURANCE COMPANY DOES NOT AN EQUIPMENT TO DETERMINE IF LOCKS OR COMPUTER OF THE BMW X5 WERE MALFUNCTIONING. BMW USA WERE NOT ABLE TO DIAGNOSE FOR THE SAME REASON, LACK OF EQUIPMENT, THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT. NEITHER ONE ORGANIZATION THE ARBELLA INSURANCE NOR BMW USA HAD BEEN ADDRESSED THE SAFETY ISSUES DUE TO MALFUNCTIONED CAR COMPUTER NOR EXPLOSION OF THE TAILGATE REAR WINDOW.",

SINCE WE HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE, IT HAS BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A   NEWBORN, IT HAS BECOME A SAFETY CONCERN OF OURS THAT THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY   SHUTS OFF WHEN THE DRIVER'S DOOR OPENS.  NOT ONLY CAN WE NOT PRE-CONDITION THE   CAR WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO PUT HIM IN THE CAR SEAT, BUT ANYTIME WE GET OUT TO   GRAB SOMETHING, IT LEAVES HIM WITH NO A/C AND IN WINTER THE HEAT WILL SHUT   DOWN.      I ALSO CANNOT SIT IN THE CAR WITH MY CHILD AND WAIT FOR MY HUSBAND TO COME   OUTSIDE OR IF WE ARE AWAY FROM HOME AND HE HAS TO RUN IN SOMEWHERE, THE CAR   SHUTS OFF AND WE ARE LEFT IN THE HEAT.  WE LIVE IN FLORIDA AND IT IS   DANGEROUSLY HOT WHEN A CAR IS NOT AIR-CONDITIONED.   I LITERALLY HAVE TO CRAWL FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND EXIT ANOTHER DOOR, IF I   WANT TO KEEP THE AIR ON, OR I HAVE TO CRAWL INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT, IF I AM A   PASSENGER.    WE CAN'T EVEN TURN ON THE CAR TO COOL IT OFF BEFORE WE LEAVE THE HOUSE OR   ANOTHER DESTINATION, BECAUSE THE CAR SHUTS OFF IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.    THE MOST DANGEROUS THING, IS THAT IF YOU GET OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE, THE CAR REMAINS ON IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS (RADIO, LIGHTS, ETC.) AND APPEARS TO BE RUNNING. THIS MAY CONFUSE SOMEONE TO THINK THE CAR IS SAFE AND THE AC OR HEAT IS RUNNING.    I BELIEVE THIS MAY CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT WITH THIS OR EVEN A DEATH, IF ALL CUSTOMERS ARE NOT EDUCATED.    THERE IS A PRE-CONDITION FEATURE THE CAR HAS, BUT IT ONLY WORKS IF   IT IS CHARGED ENOUGH.  ANYTIME WE ARE NOT AT HOME OR WITH ENOUGH BATTERY (WHICH   IS OFTEN), WE DO NOT HAVE THIS OPTION AND IT IS VERY INCONVENIENT AND   DANGEROUS.     IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE A 'SAFETY RECALL', SO NO ONE IS HURT FROM EITHER   EXTREME HEAT OR COLD CONDITIONS, WHEN THE CAR FAILS.",
