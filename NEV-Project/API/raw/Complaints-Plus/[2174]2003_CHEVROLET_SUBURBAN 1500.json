HAD I BEEN IN TRAFFIC, AND NOT JUST IN MY DRIVEWAY, I MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE AS I HAD VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER STOPPING THE VEHICLE WHEN THE ISSUE HAPPENED.  THE ISSUE WAS DUE TO A RUSTED REAR BRAKE LINE UNDER THE VEHICLE.  THE SINGLE BRAKE LINE FEEDING BOTH OF THE REAR BRAKES HAD BURST IN THE VICINITY UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT.  THE BRAKE LINE BURST WHILE I WAS GOING DOWN MY DRIVEWAY AS EVIDENCED BY THE AMOUNT OF BRAKE FLUID SPAYED ONTO MY DRIVEWAY WHEN I FIRST ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MY BRAKES WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND AT EACH POINT WHERE I PUMPED THE BRAKES.  I WAS SHOCKED THAT A SINGLE BRAKE  LINE BURSTING WOULD LEAVE MY ENTIRE VEHICLE WITHOUT BRAKES.  WHY IS THERE A FRONT AND REAR RESERVOIR IF THEY DON'T MATTER?

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A SAFETY ISSUE AND I AM REALLY SHOCKED THAT THE NHTSA HASN'T FORCED A RECALL. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF REPORTS ONLINE OF THIS EXACT PROBLEM. GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE THAT THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM, AS THEY EVEN EXTENDED. GENERAL MOTORS EVEN PROVIDED OWNERS WITH A SPECIAL COVERAGE THAT EXTENDS THE WARRANTY ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER FOR THE CONDITION DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS LONG AS THE VEHICLES AGE AND MILEAGE FALLS WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS. THOSE PARAMETERS ARE THE MAIN REASON FOR MY COMPLAINT. THOSE PARAMETERS ARE 1) 7 YEARS OF THE IN SERVICE DATE, AND 2) 70,000 MILES, WHICH EVER OCCURS FIRST. MY CLAIM TO HAVE THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER IN MY VEHICLE REPAIRED UNDER THE SPECIAL COVERAGE WAS DENIED ON 9/4/09 BECAUSE THE MILEAGE OF MY VEHICLE WAS 93,000 MILES AT THE TIME OF MY REQUEST. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LARGE SCALE SAFETY PROBLEM THAT WARRANTS A RECALL BY GENERAL MOTORS RATHER THAN AN EXTENSION OF WARRANTY WITH UNREASONABLE MILEAGE PARAMETERS.

I PUMPED THE PEDDLE SEVERAL TIMES TO ATTEMPT TO BUILD PRESSURE IN ORDER TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  THIS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  I ABANDONED THE HYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEM AND DEPLOYED THE PARKING/EMERGENCY BRAKE IN ORDER TO STOP THE VEHICLE BEFORE ENTERING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC ON THE CROSS STREET.  THE PARKING BRAKE SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE BEFORE IT ENTERED TRAFFIC. THERE WERE NO ACCIDENT OR INJURIES.  THE HYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEM APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED A SUDDEN AND COMPLETE FAILURE WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  IN FACT, THE \"BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE\" INDICATOR LIGHT DID NOT COME ON UNTIL SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE VEHICLE HAD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  ON SITE INSPECTION SHOWED RUSTED BRAKE LINES AND NO BRAKE FLUID IN THE MASTER CYLINDER RESERVOIRS.  THERE WERE LARGE PUDDLES OF BRAKE FLUID ON THE GROUND AT BOTH THE LEFT FRONT AND LEFT REAR WHEELS AND A TRAIL OF BRAKE FLUID LEADING BACK UP THE PARKING LOT.  THERE WAS ALSO A SMALL PUDDLE OF BRAKE FLUID BY THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL. THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW, CONFIRMS THAT ONE BRAKE LINE RUPTURED DUE TO CORROSION AND THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALSO CORRODED AND SHOULD BE REPLACED.  PLEASE NOTE: THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IN AND HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY GARAGED IN CENTRAL VIRGINIA AND HAS NEVER BEEN OPERATED FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME IN TRADITIONAL \"SALT BELT\" STATES OR IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTS WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE CORROSION.  WERE \"STAINLESS\" OR CORROSION RESISTANT ALLOYS MANDATED OR USED IN THESE BRAKE LINES?  *TR",

I WENT ONLINE TO CHECK THE ISSUE AND NOW REALIZE THIS ISSUE IS WIDESPREAD, THAT GM IS AWARE OF IT, AND ACTUALLY RE-DESIGNED THE HINGES STARTING IN 2005. WHAT THEY HAVEN?T DONE (AS I KNOW IT) IS ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS OBVIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I'M WRITING TO ASK WHETHER THE NHTSA IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, AND IF IT AND/OR GM HAVE ALREADY DECIDED THIS DOES NOT WARRANT FURTHER ATTENTION. THE CONCERN IS IT?S EASY TO LATCH THE WINDOW IN PLACE, EVEN WITH 1 OF THE 2 HINGES BROKEN, AND THEREFORE DELAY OR SIMPLY IGNORE THE REPAIR NEED (AS THE REPAIR COST IS SIGNIFICANT), ASSUMING IT?S SAFE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE THE WINDOW FURTHER FOR ACCESS. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE VEHICLE W/OUT REPAIR, THE ONE WORKING HINGE AND WINDOW LATCH ITSELF ARE FORCED TO KEEP THE WINDOW IN PLACE. THIS IS A POTENTIAL DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. UNDER THE ADDED STRESS, THE SINGLE HINGE WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL, AND LIKELY AT SPEED AS THE VEHICLE HITS THE LAST BUMP THE HINGE CAN WITHSTAND, OR AS REPORTED BY OWNERS ONLINE, A WINDOW IS SIMPLY ROLLED DOWN, INCREASING WIND FORCE ON THE REAR WINDOW. IF EITHER HAPPENS THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE WINDOW IS JETTISONED FROM THE FRAME AND LANDS ON WHATEVER IT LANDS ON BEHIND THE VEHICLE.  AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT EVENT, AS THE WINDOW IS 4-5 FEET WIDE AND LARGE AND HEAVY ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY CAUSE DISASTER TO TRAFFIC TRAVELING BEHIND THE VEHICLE.      I'VE CALLED 2 CHEVY DEALERSHIPS IN THE AREA SO FAR AND ASKED THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IF THIS ISSUE IS BEING ADDRESSED AND THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE PART FAILING. THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT IN MY OPINION NOT LIKELY. I WORRY THIS IS A TRAINED RESPONSE, SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO MINIMIZE ATTENTION ON THE MATTER.  *TR",
