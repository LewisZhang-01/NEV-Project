AFTER DISCUSSIONS AND TEST DRIVES WITH SEVERAL GM FIELD TECHNICIANS, THE ISSUE REMAINS AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ACCORDING TO THE DISTRICT FIELD REPRESENTATIVE, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AS A \"CHARACTERISTIC OF A BUICK\".

WHEN I GOT HOME I EXAMINED THE FRONT OF THE CAR (DRIVERS SIDE) AND SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL BUT NOTICED THE BACK RIGHT TIRE WAS FLAT. I GOT OUT THE JACK AND CHANGED TO THE SPARE. UPON LOOKING AT THE TIRE I FOUND NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE TIRE OTHER THAN IT WAS OBVIOUS I WAS DRIVING WITH THE TIRE FLAT.      UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE WHEEL ITSELF I FOUND A GASH IN THE WHEEL ABOUT 6\" LONG AND ELEVATED UP INTO THE TIRE AREA OVER AN INCH. OF COURSE ALL OF THE AIR ESCAPED THROUGH THE GASH - NO BLOWOUT. WENT TO THE DEALER (3800 MILES ON THE CXS) AND THEY DETERMINED I HAD HIT SOMETHING IN THE STREET - NO WARRANTY COVERAGE. COST FOR NEW WHEEL AND TIRE - $1002.00      WENT BACK TO EXAMINE THE ROAD (NO POTHOLES) AND FINALLY FOUND A ROCK OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT APPARENTLY CAUSED THE PROBLEM. IT WAS A ROCK, FLAT ON BOTH SIDES ABOUT 2 1/2\" THICK AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A RED BRICK ONLY OBLONG. HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT HIT THE BACK TIRE AND NOT THE FRONT.      I AM CONVINCED THAT HAD THE TIRE BEEN AN OLDER 15\" OR 16\" TIRE THE TIRE WOULD OF ABSORBED THE HIT AND NOT DAMAGED THE WHEEL.

WHILE DRIVING, NOTICED THAT STEERING WHEEL HAD A LOT OF 'PLAY' IN IT BUT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A PART OF THE STEERING.  WHILE DRIVING, KEPT HEARING A SLIGHT 'THUMPING' NOISE BUT, BECAUSE IT WAS THERE FROM THE START, I DIDN'T ASSOCIATE IT WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN CAR NOISE.  BY WEEK THREE, THE CAR'S NOISE INCREASED.  BEFORE I REACHED 1000 MILES, THE CAR WAS VERY NOISY AND THERE WAS A LOUD  NOISE, WHENEVER YOU WOULD MAKE A LEFT TURN.  TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO DEALERSHIP FOR MAINTENANCE.  AT FIRST, THE MECHANIC TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT IT WAS NORMAL ROAD NOISE AND WANTED ME TO COMPARE THE SOUNDS FROM MY VEHICLE WITH A SIMILAR VEHICLE.  BUT WHEN THE MASTER MECHANIC AND I WENT OUT FOR A RIDE IN MY CAR(WITH HIM DRIVING), HE MADE A U-TURN TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE CAR STARTED WHINING SO LOUD, HE DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO COMPARE THE TWO BECAUSE THE NOISE WAS TOTAL UNIQUE TO MY CAR.  AFTER A COUPLE MORE HOURS OF RESEARCH AND DISCUSSION WITH BUICK HEADQUARTERS, THE CAR WAS PUT UP ON THE LIFT AND THE MECHANICS FOUND THAT, NOT ONLY DID I HAVE A FAULTY POWER STEERING PUMP, BUT THE CABLES TO THE PUMP WHERE DAMAGED FROM THUMPING AGAINST THE CHASSIS.  THE PUMP WAS REPLACED A FEW DAYS LATER AND THE CABLING WAS RE-DONE AND INSULATED.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET THIS INFORMATION ON RECORD IN CASE OF FUTURE COMPLAINTS. *TR",
