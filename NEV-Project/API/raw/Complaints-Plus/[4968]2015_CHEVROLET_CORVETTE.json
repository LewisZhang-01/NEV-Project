I was in a passenger side and rear collision resulting in serious injury and permanent impairment which resulted in a total loss of the vehicle and multiple surgeries as well as prolonged and continued impairments and care.  I was struck in the passenger side door by a truck crossing 3 lanes into my 4th lane as i sat idol at a stop light, the extreme impact blew holes in the side walls of my tires. i was pushed me into the median in which i ricocheted off of and was hit a second time by the same truck tearing into the hatch and bending the frame of the vehicle declared a total loss.  not one of the airbags deployed and the seat belt failed to restrain me.  resulting in severe whiplash, TBI, torn rotator cuff and bicep tear, permanent loss of hearing in my right ear and a cranial fracture, back and neck injuries, hip and intestinal blockage(twisted). At the time of the accident NHTSA, dealer and GM ran VIN due to the suspicion of air bags and  seatbelt failure there were no known recalls on my vehicle or VIN at the time.  the first time i was notified VIN was confirmed on recall due to the vehicle being left in \"test\" mode was 8/13/2020 which i immediately filed a claim with report of injury related accident with corporate and they opened a claim and 30 days later stated that my claim was outside of the 3 yr statute of limitations. GM and dealer failed to file the recall in a timely manner with known issues as early as 2014 resulting in my vehicle not being repaired prior to the accident.  I believe this to be a Repose Statute in Colorado that is 6 years from incident and would like to file a claim against the dealer and GM for failure to properly notify of recall. failure to notify me of the recall is negligence which resulted in permanent injury and impairment as well as continued medical care which could have been prevented.",

AFTER RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET THERE ARE 1000'S OF ISSUES WITH THESE TORQUE CONVERTERS AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ACCIDENTS THESE FAILURES HAVE CAUSED. THERE SHOULD BE A TOTAL RECALL ON THESE TRANSMISSIONS.  A SERVICE DEPARTMENT TECHNICIAN TEST DROVE MY VEHICLE AND CONFIRMED AND DOCUMENTED MY CONCERNS AND STATED IT WAS OKAY TO DRIVE ?  I AM SCHEDULING ANOTHER SERVICE AT (13000 MILES). A SEARCH OF THE INTERNET WILL FILL YOU FULL OF FACTS ON THESE FAILURES.

THE FINAL TEN CYCLES TOOK A LOT LONGER TO GET TO 60. THE HVAC SYSTEM WAS OFF DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE TEMP OF THE COOLANT GOT CLOSE TO 320F, AND THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE SAID 103F.    AFTER THE 50TH RUN I DROVE THE CAR AT ABOUT 60 MPH UNTIL THE ENGINE GOT TO A SAFE TEMPERATURE THAN I TURNED ON THE AIR AND GOT THE SAME TOXIC ODOR I EXPERIENCED WHEN I FIRST TOOK DELIVERY. IT MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH AND I HAD TO OPEN THE WINDOWS. I HAD GONE THROUGH GREAT LENGTHS TO GET RID OF THAT ODOR AND THOUGHT IT WAS AT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL BEFORE THE BURNISHING. I ALWAYS LEFT THE WINDOWS OPEN WHEN PARKED IN MY GARAGE, I PUT THE CAR IN THE DIRECT SUN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WITH DOORS AND BACK OPEN, AND THE TOP OFF, AND EVEN LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING FOR SIX HOURS ONE DAY WITH THE AIR ON. I HAD ALSO DRIVEN THE CAR WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN FOR TWO HOURS WITH THE HEATER AT MAX TEMP.  THE ODOR WAS OF SUCH A CONCERN THAT TWO DOCTORS SUGGESTED I SELL THE CAR.     HERE IN CALIFORNIA 115F DEGREES OR MORE IS NOT UNCOMMON, AND OFTEN MUCH HIGHER ON BLACK PAVEMENT. I AM CONCERNED THAT I DON?T KNOW WHEN THE CAR MIGHT OVERHEAT AGAIN AND PRODUCE MORE TOXIC FUMES.    I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THE FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE IGNORED THE HEATING PROBLEM AND SAID HE COULD NOT SMELL ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE NEW CAR SMELL.
