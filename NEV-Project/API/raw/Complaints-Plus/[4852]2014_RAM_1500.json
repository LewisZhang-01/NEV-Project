The vehicle has been at the dealer multiple times for this issue, and it has not been solved.

When the system fails, there are multiple alerts present in the vehicle information center on the dash, but sometimes these do not appear until sometime AFTER the failure, and at highway speeds this does not help.   My truck is absolutely available for inspection. A quick internet search reveals this is a very common issue, well known to Chrysler.  Dealers do not know how to fix it, and refuse to replace parts unless they test as failed, which these generally do not.  This is a dangerous situation, and it is known.

My fuel sensor fails which in turn, drops my fuel gauge to empty.  Thus, I cannot tell how much fuel is left in the tank.  This also engages the check engine light which does not allow the engine to go into ECO mode.    There are at least two issues in play here.  The first, as previously mentioned, I have not idea how much gas I have left.  Since I drive on the highway to work every week day, this is a huge safety issue as I could run out of gas on the middle of the highway.  This is not only a danger to myself, but other motorists as well.    The second issue being the disengaging of ECO mode. This leads to higher gas consumption, thus lower gas mileage which would refute the state gas mileage that RAM claims for the truck.  This leads to burning more gas, which leads to an empty tank (see above for safety reasons of an empty gas tank).    I have searched online and there are hundreds of other people experiencing the same problem.  If you want to prevent the deaths of hundreds of people, you will issue a recall.   Your decision on this directly affects the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of motorists and I look forward to hearing your decision on this.",

I drove it to the local Dodge dealership  (Safford Dodge in Salisbury, MD)  to see if they could check it out; mechanic came out and said it was electric power steering, he had seen this before, and it was unsafe to drive it any further.  I felt uncomfortable driving it back home or to any other garage, as it was subject to going in and out.  They are currently repairing the \"power steering gear rack,\" at a cost of $2500.  I am thankful this did not go out while I was driving- I would have been unable to turn the wheel and could have caused a serious accident to my vehicle and/or others.  I looked this up online and found over 100 similar complaints involving power steering issues in Dodge Rams.

It appears the connection slot on the frame has corroded and the strap pulled free from the connection slot on the frame. The issue could have been a lot worse if I had been traveling on the freeway buy luckily it broke on a residential street. The problem has been known to be found in 09-12 ram pickups. No current recalls for a 2014. A local dealership will be looking at it on Friday June 18th. The truck can be available to inspect but I currently have no other means of transportstion, so I plan on getting the strap fixed asap. There were no warning lights or any other indication of the strap failing prior to it coming free. I heard an odd humming/vibrating noise, initially thought it was an issue with the tires, but when I pulled over on the side of the road to inspect what was making the noise, I found the tank sagging and the front strap was no longer supporting it. I was able to get underneath the truck and verify that the strap was no longer attached to the frame, the fuel tank is temporarily being supported by a ratchet strap that I installed myself.",

When I put the vehicle into \"drive\" and pulled forward, the steering wheel was locked and would not turn side to side. I put the vehicle into park, turned it off, and then turned it back on. The blinking light was no longer activated, and the vehicle turned normally. I drove approximately 1/4 of a mile and was in traffic traveling straight when the blinking light came back on (same icon) and the steering locked up. I was traveling at a low speed and was able to turn the vehicle onto a side street where I was able to park it and call a tow truck.  Upon some research in Ram truck forums online, it appears possible this is related to the \"EPS\" (Electronic Power Steering) module on the truck. Other Ram owners have experienced this same malfunction while driving, sometimes resulting in accidents. My experience appears similar to that of others who have described the intermittency of this issue. That very intermittency is what makes this such a dangerous issue that the manufacturer should be addressing proactively. I will not put my family back into this vehicle until the issue is ID'd and repaired by the manufacturer.",

I LIMPED ALONG SLOWLY WITH MY FLASHERS ON, TO AN AUTOZONE TO HAVE THEM CHECK MY BATTERY. THEY WERE VERY BUSY, SO EVEN THOUGH MY BATTERY WAS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD, I SIMPLY BOUGHT A BRAND NEW ONE TO SEE IF IT FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH BOTH THE BATTERY (WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM AT ALL) BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE POWER STEERING FAILURE. THANKFULLY, I HAD A NEARLY STRAIGHT SHOT TO GET HOME, BUT IT WAS VERY HARD TO STEER THE TRUCK, AND I'M A BIG GUY, SO FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON, THEY WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK. I HAVE STARTED IT UP EVERY DAY SINCE THEN WHICH WAS 5 DAYS AGO, AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO POWER STEERING AT ALL. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON A VEHICLE...NEVER.

IN TERMS OF HIGHWAY MILEAGE I AM STRUGGLING TO GET 20 MPG.  CURRENT ECM: 68306456AI  CURRENT TCM: 68234053AH    FOLLOWING THE V08 EMISSIONS RECALL, DRIVABILITY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY REDUCED AND HAS CREATED DANGEROUS THROTTLE LAG AND IMPROPER AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION GEAR SELECTION. I WOULD SUMMARIZE THESE ISSUES AS TURBO LAG AND IMPROPER SHIFT MAPPING.    WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP THERE IS A 2-3 SECOND LAG BEFORE THE VEHICLE BEGINS TO MOVE EVEN IF THE THROTTLE IS FULLY DEPRESSED. IF YOU ARE EXECUTING A RIGHT OR LEFT TURN INTO TRAFFIC OR CROSSING AN INTERSECTION THIS WILL LEAVE YOU EXPOSED TO A \"T-BONE\" COLLISION.    THIS BEHAVIOR IS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN RUN (COLD ENGINE). CLIMBING A MODERATE HILL SHORTLY AFTER PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY FORCES THE DRIVER TO MANUALLY DOWNSHIFT THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TO FIRST GEAR TO GET ANY FORWARD TRAVEL. AGAIN, THE VEHICLE WILL RAPIDLY ACCELERATE AFTER THE 2-3 SECOND LAG. ONCE RETURNING TO \"DRIVE\" AT 15-25 MPH THE TRANSMISSION WILL UP-SHIFT SEVERAL GEARS AND THEN BEGIN SLOWING, DROPPING ENGINE RPM TO 1,000, AGAIN FORCING A MANUAL DOWN-SHIFT TO SECOND OR THIRD GEAR TO MAINTAIN SPEED. THE ENGINE PRODUCES ALMOST NO POWER UNTIL THE ENGINE REACHES 2000 RPM.    ALL OF THIS BEHAVIOR BEGAN AFTER THE NOTED RECALL. I HAVE CONTACTED A RAM DEALER REGARDING THIS PERFORMANCE AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT. THEY MENTIONED THAT THE FACTORY WAS AWARE OF THIS BUT HAS NO REMEDY AVAILABLE.\"",

I HEARD A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND FELT THE JOLT OF THE TRANSMISSION CHANGING.  LIKE WHEN THE VEHICLE SLOWED BUT THE TRANSMISSION DIDN'T REACT AND ALL THE SUDDEN A HARD SHIFT  SAME ON THE UPSHIFT. THE LATEST MALFUNCTION WAS DIFFERENT.  I WAS IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC WHEN TRAFFIC SLOWED DOWN.  I TRIED TO ACCELERATE TO KEEP UP WITH TRAFFIC FLOW BUT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT EXCEED THE 45 MPH.  I COULD HEAR THE ENGINE REVVING UP BUT IT WAS LIKE IT WAS STUCK IN LOW GEAR.  I PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY AND STOPPED AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND IT DROVE AS NORMAL.  I HAVE EXPLAINED THE MALFUNCTIONS TO THE DEALERSHIP ON  SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THEY SAID THEY CHECKED IT OUT AND IT WAS NORMAL.  AFTER THE LAST FAILED ATTEMPT TO GET THE PROBLEM RESOLVED AT THE DEALERSHIP, I CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER FCA US CUSTOMER CENTER REPRESENTATIVE BY LETTER.  THE ADVISED ME TO A GM AT THE DODGE CITY DEALER IN MCKINNEY, TX.   THE DEALERSHIP ENDED UP \"RESETTING THE TRANSMISSION\".  IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IS SIMILAR TO RESETTING YOUR CELL PHONE WHERE ALL SETTINGS GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SETTINGS.  I WAS GIVEN NO OTHER OPTIONS AT THE TIME EXCEPT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND SEE IF THE RESETTING RESOLVED THE PROBLEM.  IT IS MY OPINION THERE HAS BEEN NO REAL RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE MALFUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION.

I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE TRUCK. THE FACTORY WARRANTY (5 YEARS/100,000 MILES) RAN OUT ON APRIL 12, 2019, DUE TO THE TRUCK BEING 5 YEARS OLD. I FOLLOWED THE MANUFACTURES RECOMMENDATIONS AND USED VALVOLINE EURO 15W40 DIESEL MOTOR OIL WHEN I CHANGED THE OIL, WHICH WAS AS SOON AS THE OIL SENSOR INDICATED THAT THE OIL WAS READY FOR CHANGING. ON MAY 2, 2019, I WAS DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET AT 70 MPH. THE TRUCK MADE A BRIEF ROARING SOUND AND THE ENGINE DIED. I COASTED OVER TO THE LEFT SHOULDER AND STOPPED. A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL WAS UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK NOW HAD 83,000 MILES ON IT. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AND THE COST WOULD BE $13,219.40 PLUS ANY ADDITIONAL COST BEYOND THE LONG BLOCK ENGINE. I BEGAN RESEARCHING AND FOUND NUMEROUS ARTICLES THAT EXPLAINED THAT THE 3.0 VM MOTORI TWIN TURBO ECODIESEL ENGINE HAS A DESIGN FLAW THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE TO DESTROY ITSELF. BASICALLY THE CAM GEAR IS NOT SECURED TO THE CAM SHAFT. THE TIMING CHAIN'S TORQUE IS THE ONLY THING THAT HOLDS THE GEAR TO THE SHAFT. ONCE THE GEAR SLIPS AND THE TIMING CHAIN JUMPS, THE VALVES COLLIDE WITH THE PISTONS, STARTING A CHAIN REACTION THAT DESTROYS THE ENGINE. MY TRUCK RAN PERFECTLY UNTIL THE ENGINE FAILURE. THERE WAS NO WARNING. THE ARTICLES RECOUNT NUMEROUS ENGINE FAILURES OF THIS ENGINE WITH SOME ENGINES THAT HAD LESS THAN 20,000 MILES ON THEM. THE FAILURES HAPPENED WITH ENGINES THAT WERE IDLING AND ENGINES RUNNING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. ONE ARTICLE CLAIMS TO HAVE AN INTERNAL CHRYSLER DOCUMENT THAT STATES THAT OF THE 198,000 OF THESE VEHICLES SOLD IN THE U.S. AND CANADA THE ENGINE FAILURE RATE HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS 19 PER WEEK.",

THE AEM WAS A REFLASH OF THE ECM AND TCM. AFTER THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED, THE PERFORMANCE OF MY TRUCK DANGEROUSLY IMPACTED. IF I DRIVE MY TRUCK BEFORE THE ENGINE REACHES OPERATING TEMPERATURES OVER 150DEGREES, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION DELAYS. IT USUALLY TAKES ME 5-10MINUTES OF DRIVING OR MORE THAN 20MINUTES OF IDLING (WARMING UP) TO GET THE ENGINE UP TO OPERATING TEMPERATURES. I CAN PUSH ON THE ACCELERATOR PETAL AND WAIT 3-5 SECONDS BEFORE THE TRUCK REACTS, THEN I GET PUSHED BACK INTO MY SEAT AND SOMETIMES SPIN THE DRIVE TIRES. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM TURNING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, OR TRYING TO OVERTAKE ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY.     ALSO, PRIOR TO THE ENGINE REACHING OPERATING TEMPERATURES, I NOW EXPERIENCE 'TURBO FLUTTER' THIS IS WHERE TOO MUCH AIR IS FORCED INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE AIR IS PUSHED BACK THROUGH THE TURBO. THE TRUCK ACTS AS IF THE BREAKS ARE PULSING. SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE, IT HAPPENS WHEN I AM ACCELERATING, NOT WITH THE ACCELERATOR PUSHED TO THE FLOOR, JUST NORMAL, CONSERVATIVE DRIVING.    A FEW OTHER CHANGES I HAVE FOUND AFTER THE AEM, I HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT FUEL ECONOMY, GREATER THAN 10%, AND DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID (DEF) CONSUMPTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. THESE LAST 2 ITEMS DO NOT DIRECTLY EFFECT THE DRIVABILITY OF MY TRUCK BUT IF I HAD KNOW THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AFTER THE RECALL, I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE RECALL PERFORMED.

THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 1000 MILES LATER I POURED 5 GALLONS OF DIESEL IN, PRIMED THE FUEL SYSTEM AND IT RESTARTED.  I THEN FILLED THE TANK AND REALIZED THAT THERE WAS ABOUT 5 GALLONS LEFT WHEN IT STALLED.  THIS CAUSED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEL WAS SLOSHING AROUND THE PUMP IN SCENARIOS AS DESCRIBED.  WE LATER REALIZED THAT THE FUEL GAUGE DOES NOT DROP BELOW A 1/4 TANK AND NO LOW FUEL LIGHTS APPEAR.  THE TRUCK WAS LATER DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A FAULTING FUEL SENDING UNIT.      2) THE SECOND ISSUE IS AT 51K MILES WE HAD A MAJOR DEF EMISSION SYSTEM FAILURE.

IT'S LIKE A NATIONAL CRISIS NOW AND NEEDS EVERYONE IN THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT TO PLEASE DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOMEONE DIES BECAUSE OF THESE MALFUNCTIONS AND THE DEFECTIVE AIR RIDE SYSTEM. NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN 40 DAYS WITHOUT OUR MINISTRY HAVING THEIR VEHICLE IN ALASKA, WHAT WILL NHTSA DO TO HELP OUR PASTOR AND MINISTRY UP THERE?  IT IS SO SAD THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE UNTIL ALL THESE REPORTS OF INJURIES AND EVEN DEATHS, WILL THE GOVERNMENT STEP IN AND HELP THE PEOPLE NOW?  ALSO, WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE FCA AND THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE PEOPLE TO ASK HOW MUCH LONGER, ANOTHER 10 DAYS IS TOO LONG? THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US SHARE WHAT'S GOING ON & HOPE WE WILL HEAR BACK FROM YOU MORE SOONER THAN LATER",

THANK GOD NO ONE WAS HURT DURING THIS EXPERIENCE.  THE VEHICLE WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO GENE'S CHRYSLER, AFTER SITTING FOR DAYS (BEING TOLD THERE IS NO FIX FOR THIS), FCA WAS OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED.  GENE'S CHRYSLER SERVICING AGENTS STATED THAT THESE ISSUES WHERE REPORTED TO FCA BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.  I ASKED WHY WE WERE NOT INFORMED BY ALL THE DEALERSHIP SERVICING AGENTS FROM COLORADO TO WASHINGTON TO ALASKA WHEN OUR RAM WAS TAKEN IN FOR THE MANY RECALLS?  AFTER DAYS OF SITTING, THE DEALERSHIP SERVICING AGENTS STATED THAT A TECHNICIAN TEAM HAD VISITED ALASKA A FEW MONTHS AGO   AND THEY WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING.  A LIST OF PARTS WHERE EXCHANGED, FUSES REPLACED,   AND CODES RESET.  AFTER A FEW TEST DRIVES THEY STATED THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE GOOD FOR   AWHILE BUT THEY WERE NOT SURE IF THIS WOULD PERMANENTLY FIX THESE ISSUES.  ASKING IF THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY SAFE (VEHICLE TRANSPORTS PERSONNEL FOR SCHOOL & MINISTRY) TO OPERATE, WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE NOT 100% SURE BUT IF THE ISSUE RETURNED, BRING IT   BACK TO THEM IMMEDIATELY. TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THE DEALERSHIP SERVICING TEAM STATED THAT FCA WAS NOT TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE ALASKA IS ONLY A SMALL POPULATION OF THEIR CONSUMER BASE. WE CONTACTED FCA AGAIN TO REMIND THEM WINTERS' ARCTIC WEATHER WOULD RETURN SOON, THAT WE NEEDED DIRE ASSISTANCE FOR SAFETY REASONS.  JAN-FEB 2018, WE'D RELIVE THIS EXPERIENCE AGAIN!   *JS",

THEY DID NOT DO THE REPAIR. DEALER CLEARED THE CODE AND I RETRIEVED IT. THE RAM CONTINUED TO DIE, BUT HAS NOT PRESENTED A TROUBLE CODE. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH DODGE/RAM (CASE#33123585) TO WHICH THEY RECENTLY DETERMINED THAT UNTIL THE RAM CANNOT MOVE UNDER ITS OWN POWER, THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO, DESPITE THE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. SINCE DECEMBER, THE RAM HAS NOW DIED APPROXIMATELY 7 TIMES AND SURGED MORE TIMES THAN I REMEMBER. THE FIRST TIME I WAS PULLED INTO THE DITCH AS I TRIED TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY. 3 TIMES, I'VE NARROWLY MISSED BEING REAR-ENDED AFTER THE RAM DIED TWICE WHILE NAVIGATING THROUGH A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND ONCE WHILE TURNING AT AN INTERSECTION. THIS MORNING IT AGAIN DIED AS I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO NAVIGATE A TRAFFIC LIGHT. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT DIED UNTIL I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. BY THAT TIME, I BARELY HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE VEHICLE BEHIND ME HAD TO SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES AND SWERVE TO KEEP FROM REAR-ENDING ME.

THE REPS I HAVE DEALT WITH EXPLAINED THAT THIS FUEL LINE IS MADE WITH SOY TO MAKE THE PART \"ECO-FRIENDLY\". THE REPAIR IS COSTLY AND, ACCORDING TO THE REPAIRING DEALERSHIP, CAN ONLY BE MADE USING THE SAME FLAWED \"SOY-BASED\" FUEL LINES. I HAVE ATTACHED PICTURES SHOWING THE CHEWED CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS INVOICES FOR THE THREE REPAIRS I HAVE HAD MADE. OTHER CAR COMPANIES HAVE CLASS ACTION SUITS FOR SOY-BASED WIRING HARNESSES AND FUEL LINES, SO I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED WITH THE RAM TRUCKS. I WOULD LIKE THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AS THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS AND WOULD ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED FROM THIS DESIGN FLAW. ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

WHEN YOU ARE AT THE VERY CONGESTED INTERSECTION AND YOU NEED TO GET IN TO THE INCOMING TRAFFIC FAST THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH THIS TRUCK  3.- THE TRUCK DOES NOT CHANGE GEARS WHEN IT IS LACKING OF POWER, YOU CAN PRESS THE GAS PEDAL FOR ABOUT ONE INCH AN IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING.  4.- AGAIN WHEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE LANES OR YOU NEED TO ADVANCE IN A HILL IT DOES NOT HAPPEN. WHEN YOU PRESS THE PEDAL YOU NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN FOR THE TRUCK TO RESPOND AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT CHANGES TO A LOWER GEAR IN SUCH WAY THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING ACCELERATION IT IS DECELERATING INSTEAD.  5.- WHEN YOU NEED TO START MOVING THE TRUCK SLOWLY TO APPROACH SOME HING IT WILL NOT DO THAT IT WILL JUMP AND  AT THAT POINT YOU ARE CLOSE TO CRASH IT ON THE THING THAT YOU ARE APPROACHING  6.-I GAVE YOU 2 MONTHS TRYING TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE TRUCK BEHAVIOR, BUT WHAT I FOUND IS THAT I CAN MANUALLY CHANGE THE GEARS AND MAKE THE TRUCK TO RESPOND AS A NORMAL VEHICLE, CHANGING GEARS GRADUALLY WHEN IT IS LOSING POWER  IF I CAN MAKE THE TRUCK TO CHANGE GEARS WITH OUT JUMPING 4 GEARS DOWN WHY YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT CAPABLE OF DO IT?

THEY REPROGRAMMED THE SHIFT POINTS AND IT WORKED SMOOTHLY FOR A FEW WEEKS. THEN IT STARTED SLIPPING AT 10 MPH. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY CHECKED THE FLUID LEVEL FROM THE FILL PORT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AND DISCOVERED IT WAS A QUART LOW FROM THE FACTORY. THIS IS A TERRIBLE DESIGN AND FORCES OWNERS INTO THREE OPTIONS ; 1. IGNORE THEIR TRANSMISSION.2. HAVE TO TAKE IT TO AN EXPENSIVE MECHANIC OR THE DEALER. 3.THIS IS WHERE IT CAN GET DANGEROUS, GET UNDERNEATH THEIR VEHICLE WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING TO GET THE FLUID TO THE NECESSARY TEMPERATURE TO ACCURATELY CHECK IT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SHADE TREE MECHANICS WILL ENDANGER THEIR LIVES TO CHECK THEIR FLUID LEVELS. FORD HAS A SIMILARLY FLAWED DESIGN ON ITS PICK UP TRUCKS AS WELL. HAD I KNOWN ABOUT THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE CHEVROLET WITH THE CONVENTIONAL DIP STICK SET UP. THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT THE RAM WAS FOR ITS HIGHWAY CRUISING RANGE.

AFTER SITTING IN THE VEHICLE, OCCUPANTS COULD ACTUALLY TASTE SOME TYPE OF RESIDUE.    IN ADDITION, A FOUL ODOR CAME FROM THE HEATING SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY AT IDLE.  AFTER TWO MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP, AND FRUSTRATION, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP (ALTHOUGH I HAD MENTIONED THE STRONG ODOR BEFORE DURING A FOLLOW-UP CALL).    THE DEALERSHIP FLUSHED THE COOLING SYSTEM AND REPLACED THE HOSES BECAUSE OF A TECHNICAL SERVICE DOCUMENT. THE DOCUMENT STATED THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BETWEEN A NEW TYPE OF COOLANT AND THE INTERIOR LINING OF COOLANT HOSES.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PROCEDURE DID NOT ELIMINATE THE FOUL SMELL EXPERIENCED WHILE DRIVING.  I NOTICED THE ODOR WAS STRONGEST ONCE THE ENGINE WARMED, SO IT TOOK LONGER TO SURFACE DURING COLD TEMPERATURES.

I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE ROAD WORKING SINCE MONDAY NOV. 24,2014 AT SAME WORK SITE. I HAD JUST ENTERED THE VEHICLE AND HAD ONLY TRAVELED LESS THAN ONE MILE RETURNING TO MY HOTEL.

MYSELF WANTING IT THE SEAT BELT FASTENED I TWISTED TO MY LEFT. DOING THIS BODY TWIST REACHING FOR SEAT BELT MY RIGHT KNEE BUMPED THE NEWLY DESIGNED KEY AND CAUSED THE KEY TO MOVE. THE VEHICLE ENGINE SHUT OFF. THE LIGHTS ALTHOUGH NECESSARY WHILE NIGHT, SWITCHED OFF. ENTERING THE CURVE WAS DIFFICULT AS STEERING WAS POSSIBLE BUT REQUIRED MORE TORQUE TO STEER. I ALWAYS LEARNED THAT 99.9% OF ROADS MAINTAIN THEIR RADIUS THROUGHOUT.

THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED AT AROUND 200 MILES ON THE ODOMETER, ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  IT STALLED WHEN APPROACHING A STOP SIGN NEAR MY HOME.  IT DID NOT RESTART AND RUN WELL IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, BUT AFTER 3 TRIES I WAS ABLE TO KEEP IT RUNNING AND AFTER THAT IT BEGAN TO RUN SMOOTHLY FOR THE REMAINING SHORT DISTANCE TO MY HOME.  I WAS WORRIED THAT IT MAY BE A LOOSE GAS CAP, SO I REMOVED THE CAP AND RE-INSTALLED IT.    THEN LESS THAN A WEEK LATER, THE VEHICLE STALLED AGAIN ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS DURING THE SAME OUTING.  FIRST TIME WAS IN A PARKING LOT, AND THE SECOND TIME WAS IN A BUSY INTERSECTION.  IN EACH CASE, I WAS ABLE TO RE-FIRE AFTER A FEW ATTEMPTS.    THE VEHICLE DID THE SAME THING AGAIN TWICE YESTERDAY.  TODAY THE VEHICLE STALLED AGAIN NEAR MY HOME.  EVERY STALL HAS BEEN WHEN SLOWING TO STOP OR TO MAKE A TURN.    I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH MY FAMILY RIDING IN A VEHICLE THAT STALLS UNEXPECTEDLY.  IT IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.    I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER AND HAVE AN APPOINTMENT FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST ON THIS FRIDAY.

THE CONDITION IS GETTING WORSE AND NOW THERE IS A NEW ISSUE AFFECTING THE ELECTRICAL CLUTCHES IN THE TRANSMISSION. I HAVE REQUESTED A LOANER VEHICLE UNTIL I CAN PURCHASE A DIFFERENT VEHICLE I FEEL IS SAFER. ON APRIL 3, 2014, THE DISTRICT CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVE DENIED THE REQUEST. I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE FOR MULTIPLE POSSIBLE REASONS BUT ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HE ALTERNATOR. THE ALTERNATOR'S FUNCTION IS TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY ONCE IT'S BEEN USED TO START THE ENGINE. AND TO KEEP THE BATTERY CHARGED WHEN VARIOUS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE USED IN THE VEHICLE. THE ALTERNATOR DETERMINES HOW MUCH TO CHARGE THE BATTERY BY MEASURING THE REFERENCE VOLTAGE FROM THE BATTERY. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE BATTERY WHERE THE REFERENCE VOLTAGE IS VERY LOW, THE ALTERNATOR WILL TRY TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY. THE ALTERNATOR ISN'T DESIGNED TO RECHARGE A DEAD BATTERY. IT'S INTENDED TO MAINTAIN THE CHARGE ON A GOOD BATTERY. WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN, THE ALTERNATOR BEGINS TO RUN HOT, AND THIS IS WHAT KILLS THE ALTERNATOR. A DEAD BATTERY WHILE DRIVING MEANS NO ELECTRIC STEERING,  NO ANTILOCK BRAKES, NO AIR BAGS, ECT. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS VEHICLE.   *TR",

DURING THIS ACCELERATION, WE SAW LARGE AMOUNTS OF WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM BOTH TAILPIPES.  THEN A BRIEF SINGLE CHIME STARTED FROM THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW TRUCK WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THERE WAS NO SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER.  WE CONTINUED UP THE ROAD AND THE CHIMING INCREASED IN FREQUENCY AND WHITE SMOKE BEGAN TO COME INTO THE CAB AND FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  WE CAME TO SIDE ROAD AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER.  WE GOT OUT AND THE WHITE SMOKE CONTINUED TO BELLOW FROM UNDER HOOD.  AFTER TRUCK WAS TURNED OFF, THE SMOKE SLOWLY SUBSIDED.  WE TOWED THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALER ON A FLATBED.  *TR",
