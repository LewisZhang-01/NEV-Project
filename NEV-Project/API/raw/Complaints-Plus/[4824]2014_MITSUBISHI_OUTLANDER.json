FROM LOOKING AT THE MITSUBISHI FORUM (HTTPS://WWW.MITSUBISHI-FORUMS.COM/THREADS/REVERSE-CAMERA-NOT-COMING-ON.72338/#POST-360974) , APPARENTLY THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR MANY PEOPLE.

FROM READING THE FORUM, ANY REPAIRS ARE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CONSUMER, AND MY LOCAL MITSUBISHI SHOPS HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS WRONG AND HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM. MANY IN THE FORUM MENTION 'VEHICLE SIGNAL CHECK' MENU, ETACS PROGRAMMING, CAN COMMUNICATIONS, CODING DATA, AND OTHER WIRING INFORMATION THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IS OBLIVIOUS OF.  IF REARVIEW CAMERAS ARE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT DUE TO PASSAGE OF THE ABOVE LAW, SHOULDN'T THIS ISSUE BE A SAFETY RECALL FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECT AT MANUFACTURER EXPENSE?
