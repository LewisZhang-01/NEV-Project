THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THE ALARM CLEAR IS TO EITHER TURN THE ENGINE OFF OR PRESS THE EMERGENCY BRAKE A LITTLE THEN RELEASE IT. I AM ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE SUN ROOF DRAIN RAIL OVERFLOWING. AS I SAW IN ANOTHER POST, I THINK WATER IS THE ISSUE. THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE BRAKES UNTIL WATER RAN DOWN BOTH OF THE A POSTS. I SAW IN ANOTHER POST THAT OTHERS HAD THIS PROBLEM DURING RAINY TRAVEL.     IS ANYONE HAVING THIS PROBLEM WITH ENCLAVES? THE SUN ROOF RAIN RAIL ISSUE HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A LONG TIME NOW. BUT, THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT ISSUE IS NEW.    ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS DUE TO WATER LEAKS.",

THE VEHICLE WENT INTO THE SHOP BECAUSE THE 2ND AND 5TH GEAR WAS NOT ENGAGING PROPERLY, THERE IS HESITATION IN THE TRANSMISSION/ENGINE.  THE VEHICLE HAS 94,710 MILES.  THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY IS 5 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES.    GM ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTIES OF 10 YEARS AND 120,000 MILES FOR BOTH TRANSMISSION CLUTCH WAVE PLATE (3/5/R) AND FOR TIMING CHAIN SLIPPAGE.  SO THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE MATERIAL USED AND OR ENGINES.     MY CONCERN IS THAT FOR THE TIMING CHAIN EXTENDED WARRANTY GM SKIPPED THE BUICK ENCLAVE 2008 YEAR MODEL AND COVER ONLY THE 2007 & 2009 YEAR MODELS AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO EXTEND THE COVERAGE TO COVER MY TIMING CHAIN REPLACEMENT.  THIS IS NOT A NORMAL ROUTINE SERVICE ITEM PER THEIR BUICK ENCLAVE USER MANUAL.  TIMING CHAIN SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR REPLACING THE TIMING CHAIN ON A VEHICLE WITH UNDER 100,000 MILES BECAUSE GM USED POORLY MANUFACTURED CHAINS.  USUALLY METAL TIMING CHAINS LAST WELL BEYOND 100,000 MILES.  I'VE NEVER REPLACED A CHAIN ON ANY OF MY VEHICLES PAST OR PRESENT.  THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THE GM TIMING CHAINS WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED.  IF THE TIMING CHAINS BREAKS IT WILL CAUSE TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND MAY CAUSE ME TO GET INTO A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT.

THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE CAUSED TWO SEPARATE DANGEROUS DRIVING SITUATIONS, ONE OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL.    THE FIRST EVENT OCCURRED WHEN STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION TO MAKE A LEFT TURN.  I HAD TWO CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT.  WHEN THE INTERSECTION CLEARED, I BEGAN TO MAKE THE LEFT TURN, BUT THE ENGINE FAILED TO ACCELERATE AND MERELY COASTED INTO THE LANE OF ON-COMING TRAFFIC. THE LEFT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND THE 7-YEAR-OLD CHILD SITTING THERE WERE LEFT EXPOSED TO THE THREAT OF IMPACT BY FAST-APPROACHING TRAFFIC.  AFTER ABOUT 2 SECONDS, THE ENGINE ACCELERATED AND WE WERE ABLE TO LEAVE THE INTERSECTION MOMENTS BEFORE ON-COMING TRAFFIC ARRIVED.    THE SECOND EVENT OCCURRED TWO DAYS LATER.  TRAVELING 45-50 MPH ON A LOCAL HIGHWAY, THE ENGINE SLIPPED GEARS AND WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  WE RETURNED HOME AT SLOW SPEED.  IN THE DRIVEWAY, WE PUT THE CAR IN PARK, THEN IN DRIVE AND REVERSE.  IT BARELY MOVED IN EITHER DIRECTION.  THE NEXT DAY, WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE IT TO THE NEARBY DEALERSHIP.  IT SHIFTED GEARS ON THE WAY, BUT THE WARNING LIGHT STAYED ON.      THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED US THAT THE WAVE PLATE IS BROKEN AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION MUST BE REPLACED.  WE TRIED CONTACTING GM CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT RECEIVED NOTHING MORE THAN A RECORDED MESSAGE ASKING US TO HOLD ON THE LINE.  WE HELD FOR OVER ONE HOUR AND RECEIVED NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.    A REVIEW OF MANY WEBSITE POSTINGS REVEALS A WIDESPREAD FAILURE OF THE ENCLAVE WAVE PLATE AND TRANSMISSION, THAT GM IS FULLY AWARE OF IT AND HAS TAKEN NO STEPS TO ADDRESS IT OR TO ENSURE OF THE SAFETY OF THE THOUSANDS OF ENCLAVE OWNERS AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.  FAILING ANY ACCOUNTABILITY BY GM, WE INSIST THAT NHTSA TAKE ACTION ON THIS WIDESPREAD SAFETY HAZARD AND ISSUE A RECALL.  *TR",

AFTER LOOKING AT THE VEHICLE THE TECHNICIAN CAME TO ME AND ADVISED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG ISSUE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO BRING IT BACK AND LEAVE IT BUT THAT THEY WERE FIXING THE RECALL WHICH HAD TO DO WITH THEM TOUCHING WIRES UNDER MY DRIVER SIDE SEAT. UPON LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP I EXPECTED THE PASSENGER SEAT TO BE THE SAME AS THEY TOLD ME I WOULD NEED TO BRING IT BACK. HOWEVER THE  AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT AND SERVICE AIRBAG SIGN SHOULD HAVE GONE AWAY AND THEY BOTH WERE STILL PRESENT. I QUESTIONED IT AND THE TECH SAID AGAIN IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL. UPON DRIVING HOME I NOTICED THAT I NOW HAD ANOTHER ISSUE A CLICKING NOISE COMING FROM UNDER MY DRIVER SIDE SEAT WHICH WAS NSOT PRESENT BEFORE THEY DID THE WORK. I DROPPED MY VEHICLE OFF TO THEM AGAIN ON 7/28/14 FOR THE FOLLOW-UP VISIT AND ADVISED THE DEALER THAT BASED ON MY PAPER WORK FROM GM THE WARNIGN LIGHTS I HAVE ARE A RESULT OF THE RECALL. I ALSO ALERTED THEM TO THE CLICKING NOISE AND THEY SAID WE WILL LOOK INTO IT.

THE PISTON HIT THE VALVE, KNOCKED A HOLE IN THE PISTON, AND PIECES OF THE VALVE WENT THROUGH THE ENGINE.  THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED 5 YRS AND 9 MONTHS AGO (9 MONTHS OUT OF THE WARRANTY), BUT ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE 100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  WE WERE GIVEN A GM CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT NAME ([XXX]) AND NUMBER, BUT SHE WILL NEITHER ANSWER HER PHONE, NOR RETURN OUR NUMEROUS MESSAGES!

WIFE SAT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. ABOUT 40% OF THE TIME THE LIGHT INDICATES THAT THE AIR BAG IS OFF, BUT SPORADICALLY IT SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM IS ON.  JUNE  1ST, ON MY FIRST DEALER VISIT  WITH THIS VEHICLE, I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM AND WAS ADVISED THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE AND WE SHOULD VIEW A SEAT SENSING VIDEO.  AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS AND VISITS TO MY DEALER, ROYAL BUICK OF TUCSON  (WHO HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HELPFUL AND CONCERNED) THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED BUICK AND WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THE US HAVING THAT PROBLEM  AND THE BUICK DISTRICT MANAGER SAID  THE SYSTEM CHECKED OUT OKAY  BUT MY WIFE'S BUILD WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT CAR.   WE WERE TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM WAS OPERATING WITHIN THE \"PARAMETERS\" SET BY THE MANUFACTURERS FOR PEOPLE OF MY WIFE'S SIZE. ALSO, THEY SAID, THESE \"PARAMETERS\" WERE ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW.      FAST FORWARD TO 9-25-07, THE SENSOR MANUFACTURER SENT AN ENGINEER TO  TUCSON AND SPENT 2 HOURS HAVING MY WIFE GET IN AND OUT OF THE FRONT SEAT TO ESTABLISH A MORE REALISTIC DATABASE OR ALGORITHM FOR PEOPLE HER SIZE.  BUICK OR THE SEAT MANUFACTURER SENT ANOTHER SEAT RIGHT FROM THE ASSEMBLY LINE TO REPLACE OUR SEAT FOR THEIR ANALYSIS. AS OF TODAY 9-27-07 THIS NEW SEAT HAS A FAILURE MODE OF 60% IN THE LAST THREE DAYS (15 SEAT ENTRIES AND 9 TIMES THE AIRBAG FAILED TO ARM)      WE PAID $40,000 FOR A CAR WITH AN AIR-BAG SAFETY SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT BOTH FRONT AND REAR PASSENGERS, BUT YET IT WOULD NOT PROTECT AN ADULT OF MY WIFE'S SIZE WHEN RIDING AS A FRONT-SEAT PASSENGER. HAD WE KNOWN THIS FACT, WE WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AT ANY PRICE. SAFETY IS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WHEN BUYING A NEW VEHICLE.

MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE LIGHT INDICATES THAT THE AIR BAG IS OFF, BUT OCCASIONALLY IT SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM  IS ON.  WE FIRST TALKED WITH THE SALESMAN AND HE SAID THIS DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT AND I SHOULD BRING THE CAR IN WHEN IT WAS SHOWING THE SYSTEM WAS OFF WHILE MY WIFE WAS RIDING AS A PASSENGER.
