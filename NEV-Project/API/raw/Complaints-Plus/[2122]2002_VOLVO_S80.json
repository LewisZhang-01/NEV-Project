JANUARY 8, 2009 I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL VOLVO DEALERSHIP FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND DISPLAYED THE LETTER SENT BY VOLVO IN REGARDS TO THE FAILURE OF THE FUEL PUMP.  THE DEALERSHIP DECLINED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT SMELL FUEL FUMES AT THE TIME OF SERVICE.    VOLVO HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE WITH THE FUEL PUMP FAILURE AND COULD CREATE A POTENTIAL SAFETY AND PROLONG HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE OF THE VEHICLE.  I AM REQUESTING THE HELP OF NHTSA TO RESOLVE THE ABOVE ISSUE AND BE ABLE ASSIST OTHER CONSUMERS WITH THE SIMILAR ISSUES. *TR",
