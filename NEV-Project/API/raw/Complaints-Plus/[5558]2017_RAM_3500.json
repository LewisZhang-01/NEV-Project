The dealership is not prioritizing my vehicle,  although it should since I am a customer after all and this is a recall from the manufacturer.  Dealerships should be made aware that a vehicle should be fixed as they come in,  not based on whether you are paying or not.  This dealership always does this when warranty or recalls and it's frustrating. It's not fair for us to lose this much time because we are not paying.  How is it my fault the vehicle is defective? After all it was not caused because of my driving but because it was not manufactured correctly.  I like Ram but the dealership need to better understand the customer whether paying or not.

IT WAS HOOKED UP TO MY 10,000# GVW 5TH WHEEL TRAILER THIS PAST WEEKEND AND NO MATTER HOW I SET THE CONTROLLER, FOR EITHER BRAKING STRENGTH OR TRAILER SELECTION TYPE, IT PROVIDES IMPERCEPTIBLE BRAKING TO THE TRAILER.  IT NEARLY PUSHED ME RIGHT THROUGH AN INTERSECTION AT 25 MPH BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BRAKING.  THIS OCCURRED ON A 35 MPH LEVEL GRADE AND I WAS SLOWED AT THE TIME FOR AN APPROACHING RED LIGHT.  TRUCK IS RATED TO TOW MUCH MORE.  I DISCONNECTED FACTORY UNIT AND PUT IN AN AFTERMARKET AND IT WORKED EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD, WHICH SHOULD RULE OUT BOTH THE TRAILER AND TRUCK WIRING AS IT USES THE SAME WITH JUST AN PLUG SWITCHED FROM INTERNAL BRAKE CONTROLLER TO AFTERMARKET..  I HAVE SEEN MANY POSTINGS ABOUT THIS ON THE INTERNET AND IT SEEMS FCA HAS A STAR CASE ON THIS AS WELL #S1508000014.  I FEEL THIS CAN PUT ANY DRIVER IN A VERY BAD OR DEADLY SITUATION VERY QUICKLY.  I HAD BOTH A 2010 AND A 2012 RAM 3500 TRUCKS WITH THE SAME CONTROLLER AND TOWING THE SAME TRAILERS AND THERE WERE NO ISSUES AT ALL.  I WILL BE TAKING THIS TO A DEALER IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR TESTING, BUT ALL POSTINGS I HAVE SEEN SHOW NO RESOLUTION FROM FCA ON THIS PROBLEM.  I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS GETS REVIEWED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED BY THIS.",
