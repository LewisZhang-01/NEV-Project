THEN AFTER TAKING IT ABOUT 125 MILES IT BEGAN TO PULL TO RIGHT WHEN BRAKING.  BACK TO DEALER FOR A COUPLE MORE ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR IT.  NOW IT STILL PULLED TO,RIGHT AND HAD A \"SHIMMY\" WHEN BRAKING.  TOOK IT ON A TRIP, DEALER AND MANUFACTURE SAID IT WAS OK TO DO SO.  TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY BACK TO DEALER AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT NEEDED TO GO BACK TO FACTORY FOR CHASSIS SHOP TO FIX IT.  IT WAS DRIVEN TO RED-BAY.  THE CHASSIS SHOP FOREMAN SAID IT WAS FIXED.  WE DROVE IT AGAIN AFTER IT RETURNED AND IT STILL PULLS TO THE RIGHT.  SHIMMY IS GONE.  MANUFACTURE IS AGAIN TAKING COACH TO FACTORY FOR REPAIR.  WE HAVE ASKED FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION AS TO WHAT WAS DONE AND HAVE RECEIVED NONE.  PER THEM THEY WRITE THEM UP,ON PAPER, FIX THEM AND SHIP,THEM BACK TO. DEALER.   WE FEEL THIS COACH IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE ESPECIALLY IF TOWING, BIG POTENTIAL FOR A WRECK!  *TR",
