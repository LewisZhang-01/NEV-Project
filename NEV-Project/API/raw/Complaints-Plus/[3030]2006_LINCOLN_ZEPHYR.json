        "summary": "I HAVE HAD MY 2006 LINCOLN ZEPHYR FOR 1 1/2 YEARS. I NOTICED WITHIN ALMOST A MONTH THAT MY FRONT DRIVER TIRE WAS HAVING A SLOW LEAK. SHORTLY AFTER ALL MY TIRES WERE SLOWLY LEAKING AND I WOULD FILL THE TIRES TO 33PSI'S AS RECOMMENDED, BUT BY TWO DAYS THE PSI'S WOULD BE DOWN TO 8PSI. MY FIRST INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AND MY BACK PASSENGER TIRE BLEW OUT. I HAVE BOUGHT ALL NEW TIRES AND WITHIN ALMOST 3 MONTHS THE SLOW LEAK OCCURRED AGAIN IN ALL THE TIRES. I HAVE HAD MY TIRES RESEALED NUMEROUS TIMES ( THE RESEAL HOLDS FOR ALMOST 3 MONTHS) AND THE LEAK IS COMING FROM THE BACK OF THE RIM WHERE THE RIM AND TIRE MEETS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MECHANICS  THAT THE LEAKS ARE DAMAGING THE WALLS OF MY TIRE AND THE MECHANIC HAS PUT NEW VALVES ON AND THE TIRES STILL LEAKS. I HAVE INVESTED IN A AIR PUMP THAT PLUGS UP TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHEN THE TIRES MIGHT BE FLAT. I HAVE CONTACTED LINCOLN/FORD AND THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND SEVERAL ARTICLES/PAGES WITH SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MY SITUATION.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE, BECAUSE I NEVER WHEN A TIRE BLOW OUT MAY OCCUR AND WITH THE LEAK DAMAGING MY TIRES, IT LOOKS LIKE I MIGHT BE BUYING NEW TIRES QUIT OFTEN. WILL YOU PLEASE HELP MY AND OTHER 2006 LINCOLN ZEPHYR OWNERS. THANKS  *TR",

PASSENGERS HAD TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW AND PULL THE HANDLE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO OPEN THE DOOR. IF THE CAR IS NOT RUNNING YOU ARE TRAPPED. FEB 2012, THE DRIVERS SIDE HANDLE ALSO BROKE, LAST NIGHT MARCH 30 2012 THE PASSENGER HANDLE BROKE. I JUST SPENT TWO HOURS ONLINE AND FOUND NEARLY 1400 OTHER FORD/LINCOLN OWNERS CLAIMING THE SAME MALFUNCTION OF THE INTERIOR DOOR HANDLES BECOMING DISABLED. IF THE VEHICLE HAS NO POWER YOU ARE UNABLE TO EXIT IF THE WINDOW IS UP. THIS SEEMS TO BE A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. FORD/LINCOLN NEEDS TO REPAIR THE BROKEN HANDLES AND CHANGE THE DESIGN OR INCREASE THE QUALITY.
