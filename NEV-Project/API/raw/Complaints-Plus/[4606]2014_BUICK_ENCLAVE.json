THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND FLASHES FOR ROUGHLY 30 SECONDS. THE FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS IN THE CITY, ABOUT 35MPH AND THE SECOND WAS ON THE HIGHWAY WITH A SPEED OF 60MPH. BOTH TIMES I'VE PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND THE LIGHT DISAPPEARS. WHEN I TAKE IT IN, THE CODES ARE PULLED AND CLEARED. THE MECHANIC CAN NOT GET THE CODE TO REAPPEAR. MY BUICK HAS NEVER SHIFTED RIGHT, NOTICING PADDING AND JERKING BEFORE AND AFTER SWITCHING GEARS. THE MECHANIC SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS AND THE REPAIR BILL WILL BE AROUND $3,500.00 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION. A 5 YEAR OLD VEHICLE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THESE ISSUES!! BUYING A 2 YEAR OLD VEHICLE AT $28K, OWNING IT FOR LESS THAN 3 YEARS AND HAVING TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT SIT RIGHT IN MY BOOK. GM NEEDS TO FIX THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AND SOON!",
