        "summary": "1. FIRE BEHIND FURNACE PANELING 8:30 AM MST  I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE FURNACE PANEL. I SHUT DOWN THE FURNACE AND OPENED THE FURNACE PANEL. UPON OPENING, I DISCOVERED THE LINOLEUM BURNING IN A SIX INCH DIAMETER OVAL AREA. I EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE.  EXAMINATION SHOWED THE FURNACE FEEDS THE DUCT SYSTEM UNDER THE FLOOR BY MEANS OF A HOLE IN THE FLOOR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ALIGN WITH THE FURNACE CHAMBER HOLE. THE SPACE BETWEEN FURNACE AND FLOOR HAS A FITTED GASKET AND ALUMINUM-LIKE FOIL PROTECTING THE FLOOR FROM THE HEATED AIR. HOWEVER, THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR WAS  MISALIGNED BY 3\" SUCH THAT THE FURNACE SLOT WAS OVERLAPPING 3\" OF ACTUAL LINOLEUM COVERED FLOOR. THIS ALLOWED THE FURNACE HEATED AIR TO BLOW DIRECTLY ON THE LINOLEUM AND SET IT ON FIRE. THIS VEHICLE IS LOCATED ON-SITE OF OUR HOUSE BUILDING, SO I ENLISTED HELP FROM THE HVAC CONTRACTOR WORKING ON THE HOUSE; AND WE CORRECTED THE HOLE ALIGNMENT AND PUT IN SHEET METAL, INSULATION, GASKETS, AND HEAT BARRIERS TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.  2. EARLIER HAZARD PROBLEM. SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER, WHEN ATTEMPTING ACCESS TO BLACK AND GRAY WATER VALVES, IT WAS VERY EASY TO CUT YOUR HAND ON SHARP EDGED SHEET METAL PANELS ABOVE THE VALVES. I CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM BY PUTTING TUBING OVER THE SHARP EDGES. HOWEVER, WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY ABOUT THIS HAZARD, I WAS TOLD BY A CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON THAT IT \"WASN'T WARRANTY\". I EXPLAINED I WAS ALERTING THEM TO HAZARD, DESIGN AND QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS.  3. MISALIGNED BATH ROOM DOOR, UNLABELED ELECTRICAL SWITCHES, AND CO DETECTOR. THESE ITEMS REPRESENT THE MINOR ANNOYANCES THAT I HAVE CORRECTED ALONG WITH THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CO DETECTOR POWER SYSTEM BY RECALL. THE REVERSE SUCCESSION OF THESE ABOVE ITEMS HAS LED ME TO   BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS LACK OF QUALITY/MANAGEMENT CONTROL IN PLACE TO TRANSFER DESIGN TO PRODUCTION AND WITH INFORMATION FLOW TO RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT. THIS IS CREATING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH HAZARDS TO THE   EQUIPMENT USER.  *TR",

THE TRAILER WAS NOT OVER WEIGHT , TIRE PRESSURE WAS CHECKED , AND SPEED WAS AT 60 -65 MPH AS THIS IS MY SET SPEEDS.  THIS TRAILER HAS LESS THAN 4000 MILES ON THE TIRES, WE WERE ON A TRIP WHEN THE FIRST TIRE BLEW I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER WITH OUT ANY DAMAGE TO THE TRAILER, THEN ABOUT 700 MILES LATER THE SECOND TIRE BLEW CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE SIDE OF THE CAMPER AND THE WHEEL WELL. ACCORDING TO THE TREAD ON RV NET ABOUT THE MISSION TIRES THERE ARE LOTS OF TROUBLE WITH THEM. I WOULD LIKE SOME INFORMATION ON WHAT CAN BE DONE TO GET THESE TIRE REPLACEMENTS AND THE SPARE TAKEN CARE OF. IT IS APPARENT BY THE RESPONSES OF OTHERS THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  *NM",
