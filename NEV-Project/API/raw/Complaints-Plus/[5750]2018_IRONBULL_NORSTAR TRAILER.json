ALSO CROSS MEMBERS HAVE FALLING OFF AND BECOME DAMAGED. AFTER GETTING OFF THE FREEWAY AND IN A SHOP WE DISCOVERED THE WELDS HAD NO PENETRATION PER A CERTIFIED WELDER. THE TRAILER SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ON THE ROAD. I FILED A WARRANTY CLAIM AND AFTER A LONG TIME THEY WILL ONLY REPLACE THE BROKEN PARTS. AFTER RESEARCHING. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INSTANCE AND PREVIOUS PEOPLE HAD THEM REPAIR ONLY TO HAVE THE TRAILER CONTINUE TO BREAK WELDS. I CANNOT HAUL WITH AN UNSAFE TRAILER. NORSTAR HAS CLOSED MY WARRANTY AND SENT TO LEGAL. THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED. I HAVE THE TRAILER AT A COLLISION SHOP NOW.  *DT*JB",
