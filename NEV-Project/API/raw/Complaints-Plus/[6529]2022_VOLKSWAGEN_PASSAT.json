        "summary": "The steering tightens up at times when decelerating between 30 - 42 mph.  This has occurred three times now since purchase of the vehicle new.  My  vehicle database feedback notes no repairs needed; just check of vehicle at 20,000 miles and oil change at 10,000 miles.  I am subscribed to the vehicle's car-net data monitoring system since purchase of the vehicle new from the dealership.  The monitoring system notes GPS location, speed travelling, etc.  When this steering condition occurs it is as if power to the steering is lost for about  0.7 - 1.2 seconds.  It is as if driving in a vehicle that has an electrical system controlling the power functioning of the steering and there is a loss of electrical feedback to the steering.  I have driven over 100 vehicles and this vehicle does have a problem with the steering system.  There is a noticeable pull back on the vehicle when the automatic shifts down and this steering issue may or may not be related to the automatic transmission downshifting mechanisms.",
