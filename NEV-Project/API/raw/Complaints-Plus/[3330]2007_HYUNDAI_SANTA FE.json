THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM: \"...CHECKED AND FOUND VEHICLE THROTTLE BODY TO HAVE A POOR RESPONCE (SIC).\"  THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY FOR A CHARGE OF $597.94, INFORMING ME THAT IT WASN'T COVERED UNDER THE 10 YEAR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED TODAY (7/14/2015), AGAIN WHILE DRIVING ON A CITY STREET.  WHEN I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO REPORT THE INCIDENT I WAS TOLD TO DROP THE VEHICLE OFF AND THEY'D LOOK AT IT.  I'LL HAVE IT TOWED IN TO THE SHOP, AS THIS IS NOT A CONDITION WITH WHICH I'D NOT CARE TO DRIVE.  THE FACT THAT THIS CONDITION RECURRED INDICATES THAT THE PROBLEM IS GENERIC IN NATURE, AND THAT HYUNDAI IS NOT CONSIDERING IT EITHER GENERIC OR SERIOUS ENOUGH TO ADDRESS.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER VEHICLES EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE NOW THAT THE \"FLEET\" OF HYUNDAI SANTA FE SUVS IS AGING BUT STILL IN SERVICE.

I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF FIRST PRINCE AND THEN JOHNSON CONTROLS, AND AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH SUN VISORS AND THE BRACKETS THAT SUPPORT THEM.

THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SHAKE, THE ENGINE STALLED AND BOTH THE STEERING AND BRAKES SUDDENLY BECAME VERY HEAVY TO OPERATE.  LUCKILY I MANAGED TO VEER OFF THE FREEWAY BEFORE IT COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN ON A LIVE HIGH SPEED LANE AND ORDERED A TOW TRUCK FROM MY AUTO CLUB.  THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN ADVISE THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS BREAKDOWN WAS AN OIL LEAK FROM A VALVE COVER GASKET ONTO THE ALTERNATOR, CAUSING IT TO FAIL.   THE BATTERY WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHAIN OF EVENT.      THIS CASCADING CHAIN OF BREAKDOWN IS A SYSTEMIC FAILURE AND THIS DEFECT IS NOT PARTICULAR TO ONLY MY CAR BUT IS RAMPANT WITH THE HYUNDAI SANTA FE OWNERS.

AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CLASSIC CASE OF \"BUGGY\" SOFTWARE AND/OR HARDWARE.

MY HYUNDAI SANTA FE HAD 42,229 MILES ON IT AT THIS TIME. THE CAMPAIGN WAS PERFORMED REPLACING THE CLOCK SPRING WITH PART # 93490-2B300 AND PAID FOR UNDER WARRANTY AMOUNTING IN $0.00. HOWEVER, ON AUGUST 1ST OF 2013 THE AIR BAG LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE SAME REPLACEMENT WAS PERFORMED ON MY VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE NOW HAS 56,985 MILES ON IT AND WAS SCANNED FOR CODES AND ACCORDING TO PAPERWORK, B1481 AND B1332 WERE FOUND, INDICATING THE FAILURE OF THE CLOCK SPRING. THE CLOCK SPRING PART # 93490-2B300 WAS THEREFORE REPLACED AGAIN AMOUNTING TO $282.92 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. MY OWN EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY NOW HAD TO PAY FOR THIS PART THAT IN MY EYES IS A VEHICLE SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE PROCEEDED WITH MUCH CONCERN. IN ONE YEAR A VERY IMPORTANT PART CONTINUED TO FAIL WHICH, IF NOT WORKING PROPERLY AT THE TIME OF AN ACCIDENT CAN CAUSE EXTREME HARM TO THE DRIVER. THIS PART SHOULDN'T BE FAILING IN MY EYES UNLESS THE AIR BAG HAS BEEN DEPLOYED. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS PART IS SAFE IF IT HAS FAILED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AFTER BEING REPLACED DUE TO A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE HYUNDAI MANUFACTURER.

WE DID WHAT WAS SUGGESTED.THIS DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER TO DIAGNOSIS THE ISSUE.THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY NOW SO I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC HE DID DIAGNOSIS IT WITH THE COMPUTER. THE ESC MODULE IS BAD. NOW I A'M DRIVING WITH THE ESC OFF.WHEN DRIVING WITH THE ESC OFF IT DOESN''T RANDOMLY BRAKE BUT WILL SOMETIMES MAKE A HORRIBLE GRINDING SOUND AND THE BRAKES STICK WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.THIS IS NOT GOOD EITHER.WHY REQUIRE THIS SAFETY FEATURE IN EVERY CAR IF IT WILL FAIL AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND IF THE DEALERSHIP CAN NOT DIAGNOSIS IT CORRECTLY. SOME HYUNDAIS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM SO I FEEL THE DEALERSHIPS SHOULD BE WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE.THE WORK ORDER DOES NOT MENTION BRAKES NOR DID THEY TRY TO DIAGNOSIS IT CORRECTLY. WAS THIS AN INTENTIONAL MOVE BY HYUNDAI SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEIR ESC MODULES ARE STILL FAILING. I FEEL EXTREMELY LUCKY THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN INJURED DUE TO THIS MALFUNCTION. HYUNDAI FAILED ON THIS ISSUE. *TR",

IT WILL PREVENT ME FROM STEERING THE CAR.  NOT TO MENTION, BLOCK MY FIELD OF VIEW AS IT FALLS FORWARD.  IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS HAPPENS.

AFTER THAT I KEPT MY SPEED DOWN TO A SPEED THAT I FEEL THAT I COULD STOP THE CAR SAFELY. A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT THE FRONT BRAKES STARTED SHUDDERING. I WAS HEADED FOR MY COTTAGE IN NORTH ONTARIO AT NIGHT WERE THERE ARE NO GARAGES SO I HAD TO HAVE PARTS SENT TO THAT LOCATION WERE I REPLACED THE FRONT AND REAR ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS.  IF HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY STOP WITH THE BRAKES IN THAT CONDITION I WOULD HAVE SURELY HAD AN ACCIDENT. LUCKILY THE TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT.  THE REAR BRAKE PAD WAS SO TIGHT IN THE CALIPER THAT I HAD TO HIT IT WITH A HAMMER TO FREE IT AND I HAD TO GRIND PART OF THE NEW PAD SO THAT IT WOULD FIT LOOSE IN THE CALIPER.  I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE FRONT BREAKS HAD TO WORK SO HARD WITH NO BACK BREAKS THAT THE FRONT ROTOR WARPED FROM THE HEAT SINCE THEY WERE FINE UP TO THAT TIME.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A DESIGN FLAW IN THE HYUNDAI BRAKES. THE FIT OF THE BRAKE PAD TO THE CALIPER IS TOO CLOSE AND THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF RUST CAUSES THEM TO JAM. EVEN WITHOUT RUST THE NEW ROTORS WERE SO TIGHT THAT ANY GOOD MECHANIC WOULD NOT INSTALL THEM IN THAT CONDITION.  THIS IS A SERIOUS FAULTS AND I AM NOT ALONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  HYUNDAI'S ANSWER IS TO PAY $ 200 EVERY YEAR AND HAVE THE BRAKES SERVICED.  THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION SINCE THEY COULD SEIZE UP TO 6 MONTHS AFTER SERVICE THE WAY THE HYUNDAI BRAKE PARTS ARE RUSTING.  I HAD CHECK ALL MY BRAKES AT THE END OF THE WINTER AND THEY SEEMED TO BE FINE. THE PADS WERE NOT WORN AND THE CAR WAS STOPPING OKAY.

I HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE IN THE SHOP SEVERAL TIMES FOR UNRELATED ISSUES SINCE 2009 BUT THIS REPAIR WAS NEVER MENTIONED, OFFERED  OR PERFORMED.

WHILE PASSING A SLOW MOVING TRUCK, I REALIZED THAT THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN AND WE WENT FROM 40 MPH TO OVER 90 MPH IN SECONDS. (THE CAR'S HIGH SPEED WAS RECORDED BY OUR GARMIN GPS).   I PRESSED HARD ON THE BRAKES AND FELT THE BRAKES BEING APPLIED, BUT THE ENGINE WAS STILL RACING AT FULL THROTTLE.  I PRESSED VERY HARD ON THE BRAKES AGAIN, BUT THE CAR ONLY SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE.  I PUSHED THE CRUISE CONTROL ON AND THEN OFF HOPING THE CAR WOULD STOP ACCELERATING.  THAT DID NOT HELP.  I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN SHIFT MODE AND TRIED TO DOWNSHIFT SO THAT I COULD SLOW DOWN THE CAR, BUT THAT ONLY MADE THE ENGINE RACE EVEN FASTER.  I FINALLY PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, TURNED THE IGNITION KEY OFF AND APPLIED THE BRAKES TO SLOW THE CAR. WE PULLED OVER ONTO THE GRASS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THIS ALL HAPPENED IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.   WE WAITED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN STARTED THE CAR AGAIN AND IT SEEMED FINE.  THE ENGINE WAS IDLING AT A NORMAL RATE AND THERE WERE NO ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS.  WE CONTINUED OUR TRIP CAUTIOUSLY, MAINTAINING A DISTANCE FROM THE CARS AHEAD AND MOST OF THE TIME KEPT A HAND ON THE SHIFT, SO THAT THE CAR COULD QUICKLY BE PUT IN NEUTRAL AGAIN.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER ON MONDAY.  THEY RAN VARIOUS TESTS BUT REPORTED THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.  WE WERE SURE THERE WAS A SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE CAR. HE THEN CONTACTED HYUNDAI CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THEY PROPOSED KEEPING THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS SO THAT THEY COULD  ROAD TEST THE CAR WITH DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS ATTACHED.

THE FOLLOWING DAY I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE ASSISTANT AT ORLANDO HYUNDAI.  SEVERAL HOURS LATER, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE RADIATOR WAS DAMAGED AND NOT A WARRANTY ITEM, THE REPAIR WAS $700. BEING FROM OUT OF THE AREA I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY THE MONEY AND GET THE CAR FIXED. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE, ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, WAS SOME ITEM DAMAGED THE RADIATOR AND USING HIS WORDS \"PROBABLY ROAD DEBRIS\" PASSING THROUGH THE GRILL. HE CONTINUED THE EXPLANATION THAT THERE ARE NOT BARRIERS THAT WOULD PREVENT SMALL ITEMS FROM PASSING THROUGH THE GRILL AND DAMAGING THE CONDENSER AND RADIATOR WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAYS. ASKING THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, HE REPLIED YES. THE FAILURE OF HYUNDAI TO FORESEE, DESIGN AND PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF SCREEN BARRIER BEHIND THE GRILL ALLOWS ANY TYPE OF DEBRIS TO CAUSE HARM TO THE CONDENSER OR RADIATOR AT ANY TIME. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED ON JULY 5, 2008  BY ORLANDO HYUNDAI IN ORLANDO FL. I DISPUTED THIS CLAIM AS SUBJECTIVE TO HYUNDAI OF AMERICA AS SOON AS I RETURNED.  THEY SENT ME TO MY LOCAL DEALER, JENKINS HYUNDAI OF BRADENTON. THE SERVICE MANAGER THERE TOLD ME HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I WAS GIVEN THE RUNAROUND.  I SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING SOLUTION, SENT IN BY ANOTHER COMPLIANT, SHOULD BE LISTENED TO.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF HARDWARE CLOTH ATTACHED TO THE BACK OF THE GRILL WOULD DEFLECT MOST ALL DEBRIS AND PROTECT THE CONDENSER AND RADIATOR FROM DAMAGE WHILE STILL ALLOWING AMPLE AIR FLOW.

I TOOK IT BACK AND HAD THE MECHANIC GO FOR A DRIVE WITH ME AND HE SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE THE REAR BRAKE PAD ON THE DRIVER SIDE SLIPPED AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED. HE SAID IT IS VERY COMMON IN THE 2007 SANTA FE. I LEFT THE CAR TO BE FIXED, AND WHEN THEY CALLED TO LET ME KNOW IT WAS READY, THEY SAID IT WOULD COST $89 FOR THE REAR BRAKE SERVICE. IF MY BRAKE PADS SLIPPED AND IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS CAR, WHY WAS A FORCED TO PAY $89 TO CLEAN AND ADJUST THE ROTORS?  AFTER SOME INTERNET RESEARCH AND SPEAKING WITH AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE CALIPER FRAME IS MACHINED WRONG AND HYUNDAI IS CRAMMING THE BRAKES IN, CAUSING THE BRAKE PADS TO SLIP, OR EVEN WORSE, CAUSING THE BRAKES TO SEIZE. MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY AND IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT AFTER A YEAR OF DRIVING IT (PURCHASED BRAND NEW) I HAD TO PAY FOR WHAT IS CLEARLY POOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION BY HYUNDAI.  *TR",

THEY BOTH STARTED HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME.    I HAVE THE AIRBAG INDICATOR ILLUMINATED IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE DASHBOARD CONTROL PANEL.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON THIS PAST MONDAY (23 JUNE 2008) AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE THE ERROR CODE.  BUT COULD NOT DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS.  SO THEY CLEARED THE ERROR CODE, CHANGED THE OIL, AND WASHED IT.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME TO COME BACK IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.    THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IS THAT IT COMES AND GOES.  AS I WAS DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE INDICATOR WENT OFF.  BUT ONCE I GOT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WENT TO CHECK IT, IT CAME BACK ON AND STAYED ON.    WELL, IT HAPPENED AGAIN THE VERY NEXT DAY.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE INSTRUCTED ME TO BRING IT IN BECAUSE THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  THEY HAVE OFFERED TO PUT ME IN A LOANER CAR WHILE THEY INVESTIGATE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY TRUCK.     OH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THEY CLEARED THE CODE.  AFTER THEY CLEARED THE CODE ON THE 23RD, THE ALARM DOES NOT SOUND WHEN YOU PRESS THE CONTROL BUTTON TWICE.  THEY DISARMED SOMETHING ON THE OTHER DAY.

UPON CONNECTION WAS GIVEN THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF TWO HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS IN JACKSONVILLE, FL.  ON MONDAY, JUNE 11 AM, TOOK THE VEHICLE TO KEY BUICK, HYUNDAY IN JACKSONVILLE FOR SERVICE.  SEVERAL HOURS LATER, WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE AC CONDENSER WAS DAMAGED AND NOT A WARRANTY ITEM, THE REPAIR WAS ESTIMATED AT $750.  THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE, ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, WAS SOME ITEM DAMAGED THE CONDENSER AND USING HIS WORDS \"PROBABLY ROAD DEBRIS\" PASSING THROUGH THE GRILL.  HE CONTINUED THE EXPLANATION THAT THERE ARE NOT BARRIERS THAT WOULD PREVENT SMALL ITEMS FROM PASSING THROUGH THE GRILL AND DAMAGING THE CONDENSER AND RADIATOR WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAYS.  ASKING THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, HE REPLIED YES.  THE FAILURE OF HYUNDAI TO FORESEE, DESIGN AND  PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF SCREEN BARRIER BEHIND THE GRILL ALLOWS ANY TYPE OF DEBRIS TO CAUSE HARM TO THE CONDENSER OR RADIATOR AT ANY TIME.    THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED ON JUNE 14 BY KEY BUICK HYUNDAI IN JACKSONVILLE, FL.  I OFFER A SOLUTION THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF HARDWARE CLOTH ATTACHED TO THE BACK OF THE GRILL WOULD DEFLECT MOST ALL DEBRIS AND PROTECT THE CONDENSER AND RADIATOR FROM DAMAGE WHILE STILL ALLOWING AMPLE AIR FLOW.
