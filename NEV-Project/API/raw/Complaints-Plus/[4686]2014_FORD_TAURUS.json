        "summary": "On the 24th February, 2022, I was driving my 2014 Ford Taurus taxi cab on the highway to go pick up a client. I saw a dash light indicating slippery road and suddenly, I could not control the steering of the car. All attempts to control the steering proved futile, and the car kept swerving on both sides, till it hit the divider between the roads. This is the second time that this incident is happening to me. The first incident resulted to a minor damage, and the car was taken to the shop for fix. With the second incident from last month, this resulted to my car being totaled. I am lucky and grateful to be alive. I spoke to my son and learned that there was a recall on the 2014 Ford Taurus.

For no reason the power steering failed with a message to contact the dealer immediately as this could cause a serious accident resulting in injury or death. As far as putting someone or myself at risk it's pretty obvious if you can't steer the car, you are putting anyone on the road at risk.   If it would fail when taking an exit ramp from a highway the automobile would be virtually impossible to steer.  The internet has many cases where people have complained about this failure.  It has been inspected at an authorized Ford dealership and was advised the repair would cost in the area of $3,000.00.  This automobile has just over 52,000 miles, (brand new it listed for $36,500.00 but apparently this failure has been reported at many different mileages resulting in some accidents.  The failure first occurred January 10, 2022.  Fortunately, the failure occurred while my wife was in the driveway, so we were fortunate.  That being said, my wife and I, both senior citizens bringing in a total of $2,300.00 social security so a $3,000.00 repair is just not in our budget.  If it wasn't for the movie Class Action, I wouldn't know what I realize.  Somewhere there's a bean counter telling them that the cost of a recall would be more expensive then settling lawsuits arising from accidents   After that I got on the internet to see if I was the only one this had happened to and found there have been quite a few instances of this problem.  The warning lamp came on as the failure occurred.  I did contact Ford Customer Service who frankly really didn't care.  As far as he and she was concerned, \"since no one was hurt, no big deal\".",
