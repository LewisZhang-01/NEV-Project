ONE IN OCTOBER 2006, ANOTHER IN MAY 2007 AND 2 MORE TODAY (7/5/07).  ALL FLAT TIRES WERE FROM SMALL HOLES BETWEEN THE TREAD AND SIDEWALL.  THE FIRST 2 WERE THE RIGHT REAR.  TODAY, BOTH THE LEFT REAR, AND 15 MINUTES LATER, THE RIGHT REAR WENT FLAT.  IF THIS HAPPENED ONCE, OR EVEN TWICE, I'D THINK IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.  BUT IN 25 YEARS OF DRIVING, I'VE NEVER HAD A TIRE GO COMPLETELY FLAT WHILE DRIVING.  4 TIRES IN ONE YEAR SEEMS KIND OF ODD.  THESE TIRES HAVE LESS THAN 20,000 MILES ON THEM AND PROBABLY HAD AT LEAST HALF THE TREAD LEFT.  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE OR CLOSE CALLS BECAUSE OF THESE, BUT I HAD TO CHANGE TIRES ON BUSY FREEWAYS FOR 2 OF THESE FLAT TIRES.  THANK YOU.  *TR",
