I was parked and getting out of my car when this occurred but Nissan did not think it suspicious that my car accelerated to 100% without any reason for me to accelerate and my foot not on the power pedal.  Their letter to me claimed no responsibility for the malfunction. In fact. They are claiming no malfunction at all.  I have requested in writing to get all the data they collected and although they had previously agreed to provide it to me. They are now backpedaling on that now that I\u2019ve posed legitimate questions.  This happened TWICE in a 15 month period and the last accident destroyed my car.  Everyone was eager to blame me for the first accident that did thousands of dollars damage, which I know for a fact I was parked in my own driveway and not even driving.  It was scary and stressful and still is.  The only thing I can feel good about is that the car, my beautiful LEAF, is off the road forever and will not be dangerous any longer to me or anyone else.",
