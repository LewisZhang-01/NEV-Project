ON AUGUST 10, 2004 AT 8:30 AM, I WAS GOING  TO WORK USING THE HIGHWAY I REGULARLY USE EVERYDAY, HIGHWAY ONE IN PACIFICA, CALIFORNIA, LOCATED FOUR BLOCKS FROM MY HOME. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE NORMAL. AS I WAS GETTING ONTO THE HIGHWAY ENTRANCE, GOING NO MORE THAN TWENTY MILES PER HOUR, AND AS I MADE MY WAY DOWN THE RAMP A FEW INCHES, MY CAR STARTED SWAYING BACK AND FORTH. PULLING ME RIGHT, AND THEN TO THE LEFT. I WAS NOT DISTRACTED, PREOCCUPIED, NOR ON A CELL PHONE. I WAS LOOKING AT THE ROAD STRAIGHT AHEAD. I TRIED TO STEAR THE CAR, BUT IT KEPT SHIFTING FROM SIDE TO SIDE, CAUSING ME TO FALL OFF THE RAMP AND LAND ONTO THE TRAFFIC GOING THE SAME DIRECTION I WAS HEADED (NORTH). ONE CAR ENDED UP HITTING ME. THE POLICE WAS ALREADY ON THE HIGHWAY SO THEY IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE SCENE. SINCE THIS WAS SUCH A FRIGHTENING ACCIDENT, AND NO KNOWN CAUSE FOR IT, SINCE I WAS NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND GOING AT SUCH A LOW SPEED, I HAVE REQUESTED THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND THE CAR TO BE INSPECTED. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG MECHANICALLY.  I BELIEVE THIS ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED DUE TO MALFUNCTION OF THE VEHICLE.  I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN THE RACK & PINION ASSEMBLY, TIE ROD, OR POWER STEERING VALVES.  THROUGHOUT THE COURSE WORK, I FOUND OUT THAT MY VEHICLE WAS IN PERVIOUS ACCIDENTS. THIS INFORMATION WAS NEVER DISCLOSED TO ME AT THE DATE OF THE PURCHASE, AND I REQUESTED IT FROM THE DEALERSHIP NUMEROUS TIMES. ALL MY REQUESTS FOR THE VEHICLES HISTORY AND OWNER HISTORY WERE PLACED TO THE SIDE. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I ADORED THE VEHICLE, I WOULD HAVE NOT PURCHASED IT KNOWING THIS INFORMATION. THE VEHICLE WAS \"CERTIFIED\" AND I OPTED FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE. I ANGERS ME TO FIND OUT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND REBUILT SEVERAL TIMES, AND PLACED BACK ONTO THE ROAD.

I HAVE NEVER VIOLATED THE LAW, THEREFORE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IS HARD TO TAKE.  FROM THE START, I REQUESTED MY INSURANCE TO TAKE THE CLAIM MORE SERIOUSLY, AND FOR AN INTENSE INVESTIGATION TO TAKE PLACE ON THE VEHICLE, SINCE THIS WAS A BIZARRE ACCIDENT WITH NO KNOWN CAUSE, AND EVEN WITH THE CHP FORMING AN OPINION ON ASSUMPTIONS, I WAS NOT AT FAULT FOR THIS ACCIDENT, AND WAS NOT CHARGED WITH CARELESS DRIVING, OR ANY OTHER TRAFFIC INFRACTION. SINCE WHAT I REQUESTED DID NOT OCCUR, I AM DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THIS WAS CONDUCTED. BASICALLY FOR THE MONTH AND A HALF THAT MY INSURANCE HAD THE VEHICLE STORED, THEY NEVER CONDUCTED ANY TYPE OF INVESTIGATION NOR WAS MY VEHICLE INSPECTED. I EVEN WENT TO THE DEGREE OF HAVING MY VEHICLE TOWED TO MY RESIDENCE AT MY OWN EXPENSE, SO I MAY HIRE A CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE DUE TO BAD TIMING. THE VEHICLE WAS SITTING ON MY PROPERTY FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR SO, AND BEFORE I COULD GET A HOLD OF SOMEONE TO DO THE INSPECTION AND TO TAKE THE VEHICLE APART, I HAD TO GET READY FOR SURGERY, SO THE INSPECTION WAS PUT ON HOLD DUE TO HEALTH REASONS. THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT WANTED ME TO MOVE THE VEHICLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SO I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THEN TO CALL MY INSURANCE AND HAVE THEM TAKE THE \"TOTAL LOSS\" VEHICLE.  I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT MOST OF THE REPAIRS AND RESTORATIONS WERE DONE BY MY INSURANCE, AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. *AK",

APPROX. 17 DAYS AFTER FINANCING THE VEHICLE, THE REAR SWAY BAR BROKE WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING IT. THE CAR WAS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM WHERE IT SAT WITHOUT NOTIFICATION FOR ANOTHER 2 OR 3 DAYS. WE WERE INFORMED BY A REPRESENTATIVE (I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE OWNER OR THE MANAGER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT OUT OF THE 4 OR 5 PEOPLE I SPOKE TO, NO ONE WOULD CLAIM MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY) THAT THE PART DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A SAFETY ITEM WHICH MEANS MY DAUGHTER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF THE PART AND THE LABOR. THE SWAY BAR WAS REMOVED BY THE DEALERSHIP MECHANIC AND I CURRENTLY HAVE IT IN MY POSSESSION. THERE ARE DEFINITE SIGNS THAT THE PART WAS CRACKED AND READY TO BREAK LONG BEFORE THE PURCHASE WAS MADE.

FORD IS WILLING TO REPLACE '96-97 MUSTANGS BUT NOT '98 ALTHOUGH IT'S THE SAME PART NUMBER (OWNER NOTIFICATION PROGRAMS 97M91, 01M02, 99M01).  SEVERAL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ISSUED (ALABAMA/CALIFORNIA).  SPOKE WITH LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND FORD CUSTOMER CARE CENTER (REF#1366271768) - BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE PROBLEM BUT TELL ME '98 MUSTANG NOT COVERED ALTHOUGH MEMORANDUM TO ALL FORD DEALERSHIPS DATED DECEMBER OF 2001 SHOWS 1996-1998 MUSTANG WITH THE REPLACEMENT MANIFOLD PART NUMBER.  SEARCHES ON INTERNET REVEAL A DISTURBING TREND.  FORD RECALLED FLEET AND POLICE UNITS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE BUT LEFT THE CONSUMER TO PAY FOR FORD'S POOR DESIGN.  NEW MANIFOLD DESIGN USES A METAL ALLOY INSIDE INTAKE MANIFOLD WHERE COOLANT TRANSFERS - SO THEY KNOW IT'S A DESIGN DEFECT.  *LA",

THEY REPROGRAMED THE COMPUTER AND PUT IN 4 FUSES, BUT DID NOT FIX THE SO CALLED RADIO PROBLEM, AND TOLD HER THAT LUCKY THE RADIO DIDNT MAKE THE CAR EXPLODE AND CATCH FIRE??

WHEN I FIRST LEASED MY MUSTANG IN JULY OF 1998, I HAD PROBLEMS PUTTING THAT WINDOW UP AFTER HAVING MY CONVERTIBLE TOP DOWN.  IT WOULD TAKE ME 2 OR 3 TRIES OF PRESSING THE ELECTRIC SWITCH UP AND DOWN UNTIL THAT WINDOW FINALLY SQUEALED ITS WAY ALL THE WAY UP THE TRACK.
