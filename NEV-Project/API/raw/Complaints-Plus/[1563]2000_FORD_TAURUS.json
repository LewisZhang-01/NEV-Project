HERE IT IS NEARLY 12 YEARS LATER, AND I FOUND AN INVOICE FROM 2008 FOR NEW STRUTS AND SWAY BARS THAT COST ME NEARLY $1,000.  I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT BILL WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MY SPRING BROKE IN 2004, BUT MAYBE NOT.

I DROVE HOME TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BACKING UP THE CAR INTO HER DRIVEWAY.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND LOOKED BEHIND ME TO CHECK FOR ANYONE WALKING AND THEN HEARD MY MOM SCREAM FIRE!, FIRE!.  AS I QUICKLY TURNED MY HEAD BACK I SAW FLAMES JUMPING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD OF MY 2000 FORD TAURUS STATION WAGON.  I QUICKLY TURN OFF THE CAR, GRABBING THE KEYS AS I WENT, YELLED AT MY MOM TO GET OUT AND THEN JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR AND RACED BACK TO OPEN THE TRUNK SO THAT I COULD GET MY MOTHER'S WALKER.  AS I ARRIVED AT MY MOTHER'S CAR DOOR I HELPED HER OUT AND PULLED OFF HER OXYGEN CANULA AND TOLD HER TO WALK AS FAST AS SHE COULD TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  I THEN GRABBED THE OXYGEN TANK, PURSES, AND LUNCH AND RAN TOWARD THE HOUSE SCREAMING FOR SOMEONE TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  A NEIGHBOR SAID THEY WOULD.  I UNLOCKED MY MOTHER'S DOOR AND SHE PRESSED HER LIFE ALERT BUTTON AND CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  I WALKED OUT SIDE TO WAIT FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SAW A MAN NEAR THE CAR LOOKING AT IT.  I YELLED AT HIM TO GET AWAY IN CASE IT BLEW UP.  HE DID AND IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS IT BLEW GLASS, AND OTHER BITS ALL ABOUT AND WAS FULLY ENGULFED WITH FIRE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK ABOUT 7 MINUTES TO GET THERE AND THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY ENGULFED AND BURNING UP FROM FRONT TO BACK.  WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS A TOTAL LOSS.  THE SCARY THING IS THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING WHAT SO EVER TO LET US KNOW THAT THIS WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.  NO SMOKE, NO SMELLS, NOTHING.  MY MOTHER AND I COULD HAVE BEEN BURNED UP IF WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT IN TIME.  MY CAR WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND I HAD JUST PURCHASED FOUR NEW TIRES FOR IT.  WE DROVE OUR CAR VERY CAREFULLY AND WE HAD OWNED IT FOR 13 YEARS AND HAD LOW MILEAGE ONLY 46,000 MILES ON IT.  WHY DID THIS CAR CATCH FIRE AND EXPLODE WITHOUT WARNING.  *TR",

I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO GRAND PRAIRIE FORD TO HAVE THE BRAIN RECALIBRATED. THE CAR AT THAT POINT DROVE OFF THEIR LOT JUST FINE. GRAND PRAIRIE FORD WOULD NOT GIVE ME AN ANSWER ON WHY THEY TRIED TO TELL ME THAT I NEEDED PARTS WHEN IN FACT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THEM.

I CONTINUED TO DRIVE TO THE NEXT OPEN PARKING SPACE, THIS GUY QUICKLY RAN UP TO MY CAR AND TOLD ME TO AND MY SISTER TO GET OUT BECAUSE AS I WAS DRIVING HE SAW FIRE BALLS COMING FROM THE UNDER MY CAR. AT THIS POINT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS MY CAR SMOKING VERY BADLY, I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS QUICKLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES WITH IN SECONDS. WE QUICKLY JUMPED OUT LEAVING THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION. WE CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE BUT DIDN'T DETERMINE A CONCRETE CAUSE BESIDES AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM.

I WAS ATTENDING MORNING MASS AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.  IF NOT FOR THE SWIFT ACTION OF THE SECRETARY WHO CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE FIRE WOULD HAVE SPREAD FROM THE HOOD TO THE GAS TANK AND IT WOULD HAVE EXPLODED.  MY CAR WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS AND I WAS GRATEFUL THAT I WAS NOT IN THE CAR AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.  I HAVE ELDERLY PARENTS WHO ARE WITH ME ALL THE TIME AND SOME TIMES THEY STAY IN THE CAR WHILE I RUN IN TO GET THEM SOMETHING FROM THE STORE.  MY CAR WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND ONLY HAD 90,000 MILES ON IT.  MY ALLSTATE INSURANCE DID PAY ME FOR THE VALUE OF THE CAR, HOWEVER, I NOW HAD TO BUY A NEW CAR AND I HAVE ACQUIRED A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF $300 FOR FIVE YEARS, WHEN I HAD NO CAR PAYMENT ON MY FORD.  I WANT TO FIND OUT WHY THIS FIRE STARTED.  THE FIRE REPORT SAID IT WAS ELECTRICAL OR WIRE.  BUT, THEY USE THAT AS A DEFAULT REASON ON CAR FIRES.  WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS??  I NEVER HAVE EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER BEFORE AND I AM WONDERING WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT.  PLEASE HELP. *TR",

I HAD A SHOP TAKE CARE OF THE WORK AND IT LOOKS LIKE FORD MAY NOT BE WILLING TO PAY FOR ANY OF IT.  THE SERVICE PEOPLE AT SHEEHY FORD IN GAITHERSBURG SAID THEY CERTAINLY WILL NOT PAY FOR THE REAR SPRINGS AND ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECALL, YET IT APPEARS THAT THE REAR SPRINGS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM (EXCEPT THE REAR SPRING FRACTURE DID NOT PUNCTURE MY TIRE).  I DO HAVE BOTH BROKEN SPRINGS AND PHOTOS IF YOU NEED THEM FOR THE INVESTIGATION.  DID YOUR REVIEW AND DENIAL OF REAR SPRING FAILURES CONSIDER THAT A FRACTURED REAR SPRING MAY HAMPER A SUDDEN EMERGENCY MANEUVER CAUSING DAMAGE OR LOSS OF CONTROL?  THE WAY THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE IS WORDED DOES NOT MAKE IT SOUND SIGNIFICANT, ONLY IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT CORROSION, AND I WOULD NEVER THINK JUST SURFACE CORROSION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PITTING WOULD CAUSE A FAILURE.  IF YOU LOOK AT MY COIL SPRINGS, THEY ONLY HAVE SURFACE CORROSION AND I WOULD NOT THINK THAT CORROSION SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A FRACTURE.  THE SERVICE MAN AT SHEEHY EVEN ADMITTED THAT THE PARTS SUPPLIER USED SUBSTANDARD MATERIAL.  HE THEN SAID IF THEY SAW A CRACK DURING RECALL SERVICING THEY'D REPLACE THE COIL, BUT IF IT'S GOING TO FRACTURE DUE TO CORROSION, THEY'D NEVER SEE A CRACK BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN FAIL IMMEDIATELY.

CLOSE TO A 6 INCH PIECE OF THE SPRING WAS PROTRUDING OUT OF THE STRUT HOUSING THAT THE SPRING SITS IN. I WAS LUCKY THAT THIS DID NOT PUNCTURE THE TIRE AT 55 MPH. AS THIS PIECE OF SHARP STEAL WAS RAPPED AROUND MY STRUT I COULD NOT REMOVE IT WITH MY HAND, I HAD TO CUT THE BROKEN SECTION OF SPRING IN HALF WITH A CUTTING WHEEL, TO MAKE THE CAR SAFE TO DRIVE.   WENT TO GET ESTIMATES, PRICES RANGED FROM 450$ TO 750$, FOR ONE STRUT ASSEMBLY. I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO REPLACE THE BROKEN PART. THUS BROKEN SPRING REMAINED ON CAR.  THEN ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE DRIVERS SIDE. SO NOW I HAVE 2 BROKEN FRONT COIL SPRINGS.  THIS IS NOT A RANDOM EVENT, I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS A LITTLE AND IT SEEMS FORD SAYS THAT IT IS DUE TO RUST THAT WEAKENS THE SPRING. B***S***! I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF OLD CARS ON THE ROAD WITH RUST THAT ATE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BODY OF THE CAR, WITH RUST COVERED SPRINGS, YET THEIR SPRINGS DO NOT BREAK. I HAD A 79 FORD F150 THAT WAS A RUST BUCKET, AND ITS SPRINGS NEVER BROKE AFTER TONS OF ABUSE.  I BELIEVE THESE BROKEN SPRINGS ARE DUE TO WEAK STEAL AND POOR DESIGN OF THE SPRING.

THIS COST A SMALL FORTUNE AS WE BROKE SEVERAL TOOLS (AND 4 TENSIONER PULLEY'S) AS DID 3 MECHANICS TRYING TO GET THE PULLEYS BACK ON. FORD WAS ABSOLUTELY NO HELP, THEY WANTED TO CHARGE 300 OR MORE DOLLARS TO ATTEMPT THE JOB, THEIR QUOTE WAS SOMETHING LIKE \"THOSE THINGS ARE A PAIN IN THE A@# AND WE NEVER KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH LABOR WHEN WE GET ONE IN!\" AFTER NEARLY 2 WEEKS WE COMPLETED THE WORK AND MANY DOLLARS LATER ONLY TO LATER DISCOVER THAT WHEN WE DRIVE IT IN THE RAIN THE BELT COMES OFF! AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS NOT EXACTLY FUN WHEN ON A COUNTRY ROAD IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CHILD AT 55 MPH AND YOU SUDDENLY HAVE NO CONTROL OF YOUR CAR. AS WAS THE CASE WITH ME THE FIRST TIME BY THE TIME I PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY 2 MILES LATER I HAD SOMETHING PLASTIC SMOKING ON THE RIGHT FRONT SIDE AND SEVERE OVERHEATING ISSUES!!!  THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES SINCE, ONCE LEAVING ME STRANDED AT WAL-MART,ONCE IN A FRIENDS DRIVEWAY AND MOST RECENTLY AFTER 2 DAYS OF RAIN I DECIDED TO TAKE MY KIDS TO THE END OF THE RAOD TO THE BUS STOP(THIS IS ONLY RE: 80 FEET OR SO AWAY) AND I HADN'T BEEN ANYWHERE AND HIT NO PUDDLES OUT OF FEAR, AND YET STILL LOST THE BELT COMING BACK TO MY DRIVEWAY. MY CHILD HAD A SEIZURE AT SCHOOL A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, 20 MILES FROM ME AND I HAD TO DRIVE IN THE RAINS FROM TROPICAL STORM GUSTAV TO A FAMILY MEMBERS HOUSE AND GET A RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE WITH MY CHILD. I AM HAVING TO SAY NO TO WORK(SUBSTITUTE TEACHING) WHEN IT'S RAINING AGAIN IN FEAR OF WRECKING AND OR BEING STUCK SOMEWHERE AND CAN'T SELL IT BECAUSE IT HAS THESE PROBLEMS.

IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT FORD MOTOR CORP.,WOULD NOT HAVE RECALLED THE REAR COIL SPRINGS, THE SAME AS THEY DID FOR THE FRONT. THEY ARE BASICALLY THE SAME CONFIGURATION, AND PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE FRONT COILS, DID THEY NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD NOT BE THE SAME OUTCOME.   THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY AND MOST LIKELY DEATH IN MANY INSTANCES. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE OWNER IS UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS.

THERE IS NO WAY OF TELLING UNLESS THE CAR IS ON A LIFT, SO IF AN OWNER IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE VEHICLE IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIRS OR INSPECTION, IT WOULD MOST LIKELY GO UNNOTICED UNTIL A TIRE BLEW AND PUT THEIR LIFE IN JEOPARDY WHILE ON THE  ROAD.",

I COULD FEEL THE UP-AND-DOWN BUMPINESS IN THE TIRES WITH MY OWN HAND WHEN THEY SHOWED IT TO ME.  THIS WAS ON ALL THE TIRES.  ONE WAS SO BAD IT LOOKED LIKE A BUBBLE.  THESE TIRES ONLY HAD 53,800 MILES ON THEM; ON A NEW CAR I GOT THROUGH MILITARY OVERSEAS CAR SALES IN APRIL 2000.    I HAVE HAD ALL THE REGULAR SERVICING/ROTATION/CHECKS AND MY HUSBAND ROUTINELY CHECKED THE PRESSURES.    MY CONCERN IS THAT THESE ALL HAD THE SAME LOT NUMBER - WE CHECKED THEM TO BE SURE.  THE A3X844P0400 NUMBER WAS ON ALL OF THEM.  THE REPORT READS \"ALL 4 TIRES ARE WORN OUT - BELT SEPARATED.\"      THE FORD SHOP PERSONNEL SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE OCCURRENCE AND THEY FELT IT WAS WORTH REPORTING.  IF SOMEONE ELSE HAS THESE TIRES AND AND ACCIDENT RESULTS FROM THIS SEPARATION, IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD.  THEREFORE, I AM REPORTING MY EVENT SO THAT IF THERE ARE OTHERS, YOU MAY TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO PREVENT INJURIES/DAMAGES.  I WILL ALSO SEND A COPY OF THIS NOTE TO DOT AND MIL OVERSEAS SALES.

I DROVE SEVERAL MILES, AND THEN EXITED THE EXPRESSWAY WHEN SUDDENLY THE ACCELERATOR STUCK AT ABOUT 50-55 MILES PER HOUR.  THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WOULD NOT RELEASE.  I DROVE THE CAR FOR NEARLY 2 MILES TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO, AND WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE CAR COMPLETELY.  FINALLY, NEAR MY HOME, IN AN OPEN, LESS-TRAVELED AREA, I TRIED TO STOP, BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RACE, AND THE CAR JUMPED FORWARD.  I PROCEEDED THROUGH THE RED LIGHT, PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE AND FLIPPED THE KEY TO THE OFF POSITION, WHICH STOPPED THE CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY LOST ALL STEERING CAPABILITY AND CAME TO A STOP.  I TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE, BUT THE ENGINE REVVED TO 4000 RPM AND I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE CAR OFF.  AFTER TRYING THIS TWICE, AND TAPPING THE PEDAL HEAVILY TO TRY TO RELEASE THE STUCK ACCELERATOR, I PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE HOOD WITH THE CAR OFF.  I TRIED TO FIND THE ACCELERATOR CABLE IN THE COLD (NOW 4 DEGREES) AND DARK.  AFTER SEARCHING FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, I AGAIN TRIED TO START THE CAR AND IT STARTED NORMALLY.  I WAS THEN ABLE TO DRIVE HOME CAUTIOUSLY.  TOMORROW I WILL CONTACT MY FORD VEHICLE FOR SERVICE.  THIS HAS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES RECENTLY, BUT IT NEVER STUCK FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS.  HOWEVER, THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING AND DANGEROUS, BUT ALSO COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY DAMAGED THE ENGINE AND BRAKES.  THE NHTSA MUST RECALL THESE VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY, AS THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION!!  I AM LUCKY THAT I WAS DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30 IN THE MORNING WITH LITTLE TRAFFIC, WITH NO OTHER PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE, AND THAT THE BRAKES WERE ABLE TO SLOW THE VEHICLE.  OTHERWISE, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION FOR MYSELF AND OTHER MOTORISTS. *JB",

TWO MONTHS AFTER THE CAR WAS SERVICED, I WAS HEADING HOME. ON A BUSY HWY, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CAR STARTS ACTING LIKE IT IS OUT OF GAS. MY GAS HAND SAID THE CAR STILL HAD A 1/4 TANK OF GAS. SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. WELL I MANAGED TO GET TO A GAS STATION AND FOUND OUT THAT I WAS INDEED OUT OF GAS. THE GAS HAND DIDN'T SHOW THAT OF NEITHER DID THE GAS LIGHT COME ON TO TELL ME I WAS RUNNING LOW. AFTER I FILLED UP THE CAR, MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. SO I CALLED THE AUTO REPAIR SHOP I TOOK THE CAR TO. I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS SOMETHING THEY DID. COME TO FIND OUT WHEN THEY RAN THE CHECK ON THE CAR IT WAS A RECALL THEY HAD FOUND WRONG WITH MY CAR. I MENTIONED EARLIER WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS CALLED IT IS IN THE THIRD SENTENCE. THE REPAIR MAN RAN A CHECK TO SEE IF IT WAS A RECALL WITH MY VEHICLE AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS. IN AUG. 2000 FORD MOTOR CO. SENT OUT A SERVICE RECALL BULLETIN TO ALL FORD DEALERS, THAT THERE WAS A EMISSIONS RECALL 00E10 - CERTAIN 2000 MODEL YEAR TAURUS FLEX FUEL VEHICLES- FUEL DELIVERY MODULE REPLACEMENT. I CONTACTED FORD ABOUT FIXING THIS PROBLEM AND THEY REFUSED TO DO SO. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS ALREADY DONE BUT I STILL HAVE THE PROBLEMS AND THEY CAN'T GIVE ME THE PROOF THAT IT WAS FIXED. SO IN MY EYES UNTIL I SEE PROOF AND UNTIL MY CAR IS FIXED I DON'T BELIEVE THEM. I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO DRIVE MY CAR AROUND WHEN AT ANY MOMENT I MAY RUN OUT OF GAS BECAUSE I FORGOT TO KEEP A CHECK ON MY MILEAGE.

IT WAS LIKE A BOMB GOING OFF, THE MOTOR BECAME LOUD AND STARTED REVVING.    THE  PLASTIC MANIFOLD HAD EXPLODED DUE TO THE PCM (POWER TRAIN CONTROL MODULE) HAVING THE WRONG FLASH (A SOFTWARE PROBLEM PROGRAMMED AT THE FACTORY). THE PCM CAUSED A BACKFIRE OUT THE TOP OF THE MOTOR.  FORD DEALERS WERE SUPPOSE TO CORRECT THIS IN APRIL/ MAY OF 2000 .  I PURCHASED MY CAR IN JULY 2000 AFTER THEY WERE ALL SUPPOSE TO BE FIXED.    THE FORD DEALER  HAS COME DOWN FROM $500 TO $250 TO FIX MY CAR, BUT REFUSES TO TO FIX IT FREE.   WE ARE NOW AT A STALEMATE UNLESS I AGREE TO PAY FOR THE MANUFACTURER\u0019S DEFECT.

THE MILEAGE AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE WAS 61,841 AND THE BILL CAME TO $2,162.90 LESS $100 BECAUSE I HAD A COUPON.  MY CAR HAS THE AXOD TYPE TRANSMISSION.

ON TUESDAY, 2/10/04, I TOOK THE CAR TO BJ'S WHOLESALE CLUB ON ROUTE 20 IN AUBURN, MA, TO PURCHASE A NEW TIRE, AND WHEN THEY REMOVED THE SPARE THEY COULD SEE THAT THE LARGE SPRING THAT GOES AROUND THE STRUT HAD BROKEN AND HAD CUT THE TIRE. THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THESE BROKEN SPRINGS ON FORD TAURUSES. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO HARR FORD IN WORCESTER, MA TO BE REPAIRED. THE SERVICE MANAGER I SPOKE TO THERE SAID HE HAS NOT NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE FAILURES.

OWNERS WHO TAKE THEIR VEHICLES TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER ON AN AGREED UPON SERVICE DATE AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-800-392-3673.

THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.    THE FORD DEALER DISCOVERED THE REAR SPRING FAILURE AND THE TIRE DAMAGE DURING A ROUTINE ANNUAL STATE SAFETY INSPECTION.  WHEN I SEARCHED THE NHTSA WEBSITE, I LEARNED THAT TAURUS FRONT SPRING FAILURES WERE REPORTED AT ABOUT 45000 MILES BUT NO REAR SPRING FAILURES HAD BEEN REPORTED.   WE REPLACED THE FRONT & REAR SPRINGS.      OUR CAR WAS IN THE DEALER\u0019S REPAIR SHOP FOR 25 DAYS.   FORD MOTOR COMPANY REFUSED TO COVER THE ENTIRE REPAIR COST.  FORD DIDN\u0019T PROVIDE A LONER CAR.  I DON'T KNOW IF FORD HAS A PROACTIVE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.

THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES, BUT DEALER SAYS NOTHING WRONG. LAST WEEK I PUT THE CAR UP ON A HOIST AND MADE A VISUAL INSPECTION MYSELF, AND FOUND DEFECTS THAT I BELIEVE WARRANT A RECALL. THE PROBLEM: WHENEVER I HAVE ONE OR TWO PASSENGERS IN THE BACK SEAT, THE REAR SUSPENSION MAKE CLUNKING NOISES. DURING MY INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE TORSION BAR IS TOO WEAK AND ALLOWS A THE CAR TO BOTTOM OUT WITH A FRAME CROSSMEMBER HITTING THE TORSION BAR. THIS HAPPENS ON BOTH TORSION BARS. THESE ARE PARTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED TO HIT EACH OTHER (NO RUBBER BUMP PADS). IN FACT, IF I WERE NOT SO CAREFUL, THIS BOTTOMING OUT COULD BREAK THE TORSION BAR A CAUSE THE CAR TO LOSE CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THE TAILPIPE RUBBING AGAINST THE LEFT TORSION BAR WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY CAUSE A CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK UNDER THE CABIN. ALSO, THERE IS A BRAKE LINE THAT IS BEING RUBBED AND WORN BECAUSE IT IS WEDGED AGAINST THE LEFT TORSION BAR AND WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR THROUGH. I FEEL THAT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE CORRECTED AT NO COST TO ME BY THE DEALER. THE WEAK TORSION BARS THAT ALLOW THE CAR TO BOTTOM OUT MAY NEED A RECALL TO REPLACE WITH STRONGER ONES. THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO PURCHASED THIS CAR AS A FAMILY CAR AND REGULARLY PUT PEOPLE IN THE BACK SEAT.

THE BRAKE LAMPS WILL NOT COME ON, I CANNOT MOVE THE GEAR SELECTOR OUT OF \"PARK\", AND THE CRUISE CONTROL WILL NOT DISABLE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD, AND FORD HAS ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING THE SWITCH, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THE REPLACEMENT SWITCHES ARE ALSO DEFECTIVE.  THE DEFECT OBVIOUSLY CAUSES SEVERAL SAFETY HAZARDS AND SERIOUS RISK OF AN ACCIDENT.  THE WORST PART IS, MY DEALER HAS INFORMED ME THAT THE RECALL HAS ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED, AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK DONE AGAIN.  FORD MOTOR CUSTOMER SERVICE CONFIRMED THIS DURING PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM.  THIS CONCERNS ME BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SAY YOU HAVE FIXED A DEFECT IF THE DEFECT KEEPS OCCURRING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THE PROBLEM, WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DONE.      I HAVE ALSO HAD A WIPER MOTOR COVER REPLACED ON THIS CAR UNDER RECALL.  THIS WAS DUE TO A RISK OF FIRE.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT I STILL HAVE A RISK OF FIRE?  THEY TOLD ME THE RECALL FIXED THE BRAKE LIGHT PROBLEM, BUT IT DID NOT.  COULD IT BE THAT MY WIPER MOTOR MAY STILL CAUSE A FIRE, BUT IT IS OK, FORD HAS ALREADY FIXED IT, SO THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE?  THIS IS VERY POOR JUDGMENT.

THE VEHICLE IS KEPT IN HOUSE GARAGE. AFTER DRIVING A FEW DAYS ON RAIN SLICK ROADS AND AFTER BEING IN THE GARAGE OVERNIGHT THE REAR BRAKES HAD LOCKED SHUT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO MOVE. IT TOOK SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH-OUT THE DAY OF GENTLE SHIFTING BETWEEN DRIVE AND REVERSE TO GE THE REAR BRAKES TO UNLOCK AND FREE THE CAR TO MOVE. TOOK THE CAR IMMEDIATELY TO A NEARBY GOODYEAR DEALER TO HAVE THE BRAKES CHECKED. THE BRAKES APPEARED TO HAVE RUSTED SHUT. THE BRAKE CYLINDER COVERS ON BOTH REAR WHEELS HAD BURNED HOLES IN THEM FROM THE EXCESSIVE HEAT CREATED BY DRIVING WITH RUSTED BRAKES. THE EMERGENCY BRAKE CABLE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM, AND IT DID NOT SHOW ANY EVIDENCE OF BEING LOCKED. CALLED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER TO FIND OUT IF FORD WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WAS ADVISED THAT SINCE THE 3 YEAR, 36,000 MILE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED FORD WASN'T INTERESTED IN REVIEWING THE PROBLEM. FORD DEALER OFFERED TO MAKE REPAIRS AT MY EXPENSE AND THEN FILE A REPORT WITH FORD. I CHOSE TO HAVE GOODYEAR FIX THE BRAKES, AND KEPT THE RUSTED BURNED PARTS FOR FUTURE REVIEW IF NECESSARY.  SITUATION CREATED A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEREBY THE REAR BRAKES COULD HAVE HEATED TO THE POINT OF CAUSING A FIRE OR OTHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS IF WE HAD TO TAKE THE VEHICLE ON A LONG DISTANCE DRIVE.

THE PROBLEM:  WHENEVER I HAVE ONE OR TWO PASSENGERS IN THE BACK SEAT, THE REAR SUSPENSION MAKE CLUNKING NOISES.  DURING MY INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE TORSION BAR IS TOO WEAK AND ALLOWS A THE CAR TO BOTTOM OUT WITH A FRAME CROSSMEMBER HITTING THE TORSION BAR.  THIS HAPPENS ON BOTH TORSION BARS.  THESE ARE PARTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED TO HIT EACH OTHER (NO RUBBER BUMP PADS).  IN FACT, IF I WERE NOT SO CAREFUL, THIS BOTTOMING OUT COULD BREAK THE TORSION BAR A CAUSE THE CAR TO LOSE CONTROL.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THE TAILPIPE RUBBING AGAINST THE LEFT TORSION BAR WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY CAUSE A CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK UNDER THE CABIN.   ALSO, THERE IS A BRAKE LINE THAT IS BEING RUBBED AND WORN BECAUSE IT IS WEDGED AGAINST THE LEFT TORSION BAR AND WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR THROUGH.  I FEEL THAT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE CORRECTED AT NO COST TO ME BY THE DEALER.  THE WEAK TORSION BARS THAT ALLOW THE CAR TO BOTTOM OUT MAY NEED A RECALL TO REPLACE WITH STRONGER ONES.  THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO PURCHASED THIS CAR AS A FAMILY CAR AND REGULARLY PUT PEOPLE IN THE BACK SEAT.

I WAS ADVISED TO IMMEDIATELY TAKE MY CAR TO THE NEAREST AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER, THAT BEING BURGE FORD OF SANTA MONICA.  ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE OFFERED TO SEND A TOW TRUCK BUT SAID I SHOULD BE OKAY TO DRIVE THE SHORT DISTANCE MYSELF.  AS THIS OCCURRED AT THE END OF MY LUNCH BREAK, THIS CAUSED ME TO RETURN TO WORK VERY LATE THAT AFTERNOON.  AFTER TWO DAYS ON 2/2/01, BURGE FORD ASSURED ME THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  I PICKED UP THE CAR AND DROVE LESS THAN TWO MILES FROM THE SERVICE CENTER.  AGAIN, THE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE BACK TO BURGE FORD.  BURGE FORD ENCOURAGED ME TO STAY A \u0013FEW MINUTES, \u0013 THEN \u001330 MINUTES\u0014 ETC. TO SEE IF THE MECHANIC COULD FIX THE PROBLEM WHILE I WAITED.  EVENTUALLY, THEY OFFERED TO PROVIDE ME WITH A FREE RENTAL CAR AS IT WAS NOW LATE AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY AND MY CAR WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVER THE WEEKEND.  AGAIN, I HAD TO MISS A WORK.  AGAINST MY WISHES, THEY DID NOT WRITE A NEW REPAIR ORDER FOR 2/2/01 BUT RE-OPENED THE PRIOR ORDER.  IN ADDITION, HAVING EARLIER ASKED FOR MY COPY OF MY CLOSING SERVICE INVOICE FOR THE 1/31/01 SERVICE, THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE COPY TO ME SO THAT I HAD NO PROOF THAT THEY HAD CLOSED OUT THE ORIGINAL SERVICE ORDER.  UPON THE NEXT OCCURRENCE, I SWITCHED TO GALPIN FORD\u0012S SERVICE WHOM I FOUND TO BE MORE ETHICAL.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO GALPIN FOR THE SAME RECURRING PROBLEM ON 2/8/01, 3/6/01, 5/16/01, AND 11/16/01.  EACH TIME I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO GALPIN, I HAD TO PAY FOR A RENTAL AS ONE WAS NOT PROVIDED TO ME FREE OF CHARGE.

THE FIRST TIME THE CAR STALLED AS I WAS ACCELERATING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION AFTER BEING STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT. THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART AND I HAD TO BE TOWED AFTER OWNING THE CAR FOR 17 DAYS. THE SECOND AND THIRD TIME THE CAR STALLED IT WAS WHILE GOING 20-30 MPH AFTER HAVING IDLED IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. BOTH TIMES THE CAR RESTARTED. EACH TIME BEFORE IT STALLED THE ENGINE COUGHED AND IDLED ROUGHLY, THE RPM NEEDLE BOUNCED WILDLY AND THEN THE CAR DIED INCLUDING POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. THE FIRST TIME THE DEALER REPLACED THE FUEL PRESSURE SENSORS AND SAID THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. THREE WEEKS LATER IT STALLED FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE DEALER I TOOK IT TO THAT TIME SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT AND THAT I WOULD JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS LAST TIME THEY SAID THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP BUT THAT IT COULD TAKE UP TO 2 WEEKS SINCE FORD IS HAVING PROBLEMS DELIVERING THE PARTS. I FIND THIS UNACCEPTABLE SINCE THERE ARE ALREADY A NUMBER OF IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS IN YOUR DATA BASE INCLUDING FROM FLEET SERVICES WHO HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CARS FAIL. THE FIRST DEALER EVEN SAID HE WAS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH A NUMBER OF THE TAURUSES HE HAD SOLD RECENTLY. THIS CANNOT BE COMING AS A BIG SURPRISE TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY. THE MOST RECENT SERVICE MANAGER ALSO SAID AND I QUOTE \" THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T SEE THIS AS A MAJOR PROBLEM.\" SO NOW I AM STUCK WITH RENTAL CAR FEES AND CAR PAYMENTS BECAUSE FORD CAN NOT OFFER RELIABLE SERVICE IN A TIMELY FASHION. TO DATE THE CAR HAS BEEN UNAVAILABLE TO ME FOR 13 DAYS AND COUNTING. FORD JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO SHOW AMPLE CONCERN THAT STALLING UNEXPECTEDLY ON THE HIGHWAY PLACES MY LIFE, OTHERS' LIVES AND THE PATIENTS' UNDER MY CARE LIVES IN DANGER. YOU WOULD THINK AFTER THE FIRESTONE/EXPLORER FIASCO THEY WOULD AT LEAST PAY LIP SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE. *AK",
