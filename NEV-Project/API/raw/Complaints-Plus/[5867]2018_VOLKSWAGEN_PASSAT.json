There was no warning and it just happened suddenly. My family and other drivers safety were at risk. The dealership said it was due to impact but their estimate didn't mention or included any of the brake components. The brake caliber bracket is broken and the holes were the caliber bolts attached are elongated. The brake caliber and bracket are protected inside the rim and brakes just don't fall off. It is a VW certified car. I put 4,000 miles since I purchased and the accident happened on November 17, 2021. I have all the components and pictures.",

Went on a 5 minute test drive with Yancey Cobb who stated there was nothing wrong with the car and that I needed to call the Finance company and finalize the deal or I wouldn't have a car. Meaning I couldn't get my traded car back either. They shut the dealership down on me and left me on the lot to retrieve my articles from one car to the next and there was no gas in the car because the gas light was on. They gave no paperwork. I had no idea there was no warranty until I took it to Heritage Harford Rd who gave the car back broken. 3 times. They keep saying they can't duplicate the problem. I contacted the BBB and they Mike Molnar lied and said he contacted me. Never responded to the rebuttal. I contacted Volkswagen customer care via Twitter with Stephani S. Nothing. I went to Country Dubbs, nothings wrong, Brooks Huff, Nothing wrong. T&S Auto, nothing. This vehicles stops traffic everyday on York Rd. I've contacted the FairTrade Commission. Nobody will help with this issue. It sways, it wiggles, the wheel rides like it's bent, it feels like it sticks at times and looks like crap on the road, but nody knows what's wrong. I've called Antwerpen Corporate. Spoke to Aileen Sanders who won't return my calls after telling me there was no paperwork in the jacket for the deal. Who sells a car at 19k miles on it with no warranty, they don't give you a bill of sale, and they treat women like dirt. They have so many negative and sheisty reviews on their website. Why are car dealers such liars and cheats. I don't want this car for all the hassle and deception and a note on a car that's been broke since the turn of the key for me.",

The vehicle will then roll until the brake is applied or it comes to a rest on a flat surface or against a pole or hard object.   This is a significant safety hazard that has occurred to me 3-4 times, the most recent was today when the vehicle rolled backwards down my mothers driveway.  Crossed the street, entered the neighbors driveway/yard, contacted the mail box and came to rest in the front yard.  The vehicle rolled approx. 200ft.   The vehicle is equipped with auto braking and parking collision warning, that are capable of sensing a collision while driving and notifying the driver of objects while parking. The same system should be able to prevent a car turned off while in drive from rolling uncontrolled and striking a person or object.  In addition the car should have generate a significant audio and visual warnings to the driver, furthermore the car should not be able to be turned off while in drive. It\u2019s a fundamental flaw that it can be turned off, drivers door opened, driver and keys step out of the vehicle with no response from the vehicle.",
