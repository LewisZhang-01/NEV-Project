        "summary": "1. The vehicle infotainment screen has been rebooting multiple times over the last few months while driving and the navigation maps screen goes black during the reboot, this is very distracting . 2. The navigation map turn by turn directions intermittently stops working independent of this reboot, causing missed turns, again distracting. 3. The rear camera video intermittently is grayed out instead of showing the rear camera video. I took the car to multiple dealers. The 1st dealer (Nissan of New Rochelle, NY; odometer @ approximately  18,470 miles) said unless the problem is repeatable while in for service there is nothing they can do about it. The other dealer (Star Nissan of Flushing, NY; odometer at 20,470 miles) did a AV software update. Since that AV update on 1/28/2022, Problem #1 and #3 so far have not returned. It may be too early to declare success since today is 2/16/2022. Problem #2 remains! I also noticed that when using Apple Car Play (using a USB wired connection to the Infotainment System) received phone call audio is poor and sounds like someone is gargling. If I switch the phone connection to wireless Bluetooth the audio quality is perfect, so it is not a carrier or phone connection to the network issue. This may be related to problem #2, where the navigation audio stops working. BTW When the Navigation audio stop working,I also lose the ability to change the radio audio.  It shows it is changing visually from 0 to +40 on the screen, but the sound audio level remains unchanged. Usually if the car is turned off for more than an hour all returns to normal, at least initially until the next intermittent repeat of the issue. If I turn off the car and turn it back after only a minute or two, the audio problem remains the same.",

        "summary": "About January 19, 2022 when the temperature was about -10 degrees F I drove my 2019 Nissan Leaf about 5 miles.  When I turned on the car the battery level was at 60%.  After I had been driving for about \u00bd mile I got a dashboard message that the battery was cold and power would  be reduced.  I got a similar message a few days before which did not result in any difference in power levels, so I ignored the message.  At about 3 miles I had to go up a 10% grade hill of about 1/4 mile in length.  As soon as I started up the hill and was accelerating I got the power reduction message again. At that point I was traveling about 50mph. Then in the next 10 seconds, and while I was about half way up the hill, the battery indicator on the dashboard dropped all the way down to 1%.  The car lost all of its power and I had to pull over to the side of the road.  As soon as I stopped the battery indicator started to rise and within the next 30 seconds had returned to 60%.   I continued up the hill, and noticed that the power was decreasing and the battery indicator was dropping again.  I made it to the top of the hill and stopped again.  The battery indicator returned to 60%. I had to stop one more time to allow the battery to recover, but made it to my destination without further problems. Two hours later I started for home and the car operated normally.  Between that day and February 5 there have been no further incidents, even though early morning temperatures have ranged from -7 degrees to -28 degrees on 13 days.  I took the car to Freedom Nissan in South Burlington, VT on Feb. 2. However, they told me that there was no record of such an incident on the computer and they would do nothing without such a record.  To have the car go from full power to zero power in a 10 second period is a very disconcerting experience.  It should have provoked an error message in the onboard computer. I think this is a safety problem and would like you to look into it.",

I was driving an almost dead battery (8% charge remaining and 13 miles left) and the 2019 model Nissan Leaf car (20K miles driven) was already very heavy while entering our alley (backyard parking). I was driving at 10 mile speed or under when our fence door was in the process of opening  (half way opened) and the car garage was already opened; the car jerked forward with a sudden speed, dashed through the fence door and did not stop on drive way (brakes failed) and entered into the garage,  hitting the storage racks built to the wall and the toilet right behind it. Things fell on the windshield, obstructed the car when it finally stopped (had to hit the stop button by force).  I was scared to death if the car was going to get on a fire or would result in an electric short circuit. Luckily I was saved  with no major injuries and God was beside me  and saved me from causing any damage to anyone or other's properties. I am sure there might have been other such complaints on Nissan Leaf and want to bring this to light.",

I HAVE MULTIPLE VIDEOS OF ALL OF THIS. I CONTACTED NISSAN BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THE CAR IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. I AM CONTACTING THE BBB LEMON LAW SECTION.
