        "summary": "On 11/27/21 I was driving my 2019 mustang GT convertible with approx 15,000 miles.  While going around a curve (not at an excessive speed) on dry pavement, the car became uncontrollable and began to spin out.  As much as I tried to brake and steer into the slide, the car became more and more uncontrollable and felt as though it were speeding up.  I only came to a stop after slamming into a tree and rolling over to the other side of the road.  Vehicle is a total loss.  I was lucky and only suffered minor injuries, but it very easily could have been much worse.  The police and paramedics who arrived at the scene were expecting a fatality or severe injuries.  In the end I was ticketed for failure to reduce speed.  I'm losing my mind explaining to the police and insurance that the car sped up on its own and all control of the vehicle were lost.  I am in danger of losing my license because of this and no one is believing that this could possibly happen and convinced me to state that I was probably driving too fast.  This is a deadly problem.  The internet is full of videos demonstrating this same problem: complete loss of control in a low speed turn.  Before you ask, I wasn't racing, I wasn't drifting, I wasn't spinning my tires or doing donuts; I was just trying to go home to my kids who almost lost their father.   If there is any saved data or physical evidence that needs to be saved, action is needed ASAP before the insurance company scraps it. Also, it should be noted that in the week leading up to the accident, the rear end would become loose when going around corners.  I had planned to have it addressed at the next oil change.",
