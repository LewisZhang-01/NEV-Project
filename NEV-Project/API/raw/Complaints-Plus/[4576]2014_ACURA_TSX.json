I'VE BROUGHT IT IN MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE SAME ISSUE, THEY WOULD SEND ME HOME AND SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR.     ON JAN 2017, AFTER BRINGING MY CAR IN FOR THE 8TH TIME, THEY FINALLY TOLD ME THAT MY CAR WAS PURCHASED WITH A BAD BATTERY FROM THE MANUFACTURER WAREHOUSE, THAT WAS WHY MY CAR WOULDN'T START FOR 2 YEARS. SO THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY.     JAN 2019 EXACTLY 2 YEARS LATER,  MY CAR STALLS AGAIN! I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AAA TO REPLACE MY BATTERY 01/15/19. MY CAR STILL FAILED TO START AS THE AAA TECHNICIAN ASKED ME TO START MY CAR. SO I DROPPED IT OFF AT ACURA OF CONCORD AGAIN ON 01/17/19. THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE AGENT CALLED ME LATER THAT DAY JAN 17TH AND SAID MY CAR WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NO ISSUES. SHE CALLED ME AGAIN JAN 18TH AND SAID MY CAR PASSED ALL INSPECTIONS AND I CAN PICK IT UP NEXT DAY. JAN 19TH MORNING, SHE CALLS ME AND SAYS, \"YOU HAVE A BAD BATTERY\". BUT I JUST REPLACED MY BATTERY ON JAN 15TH AND IT NEEDS REPLACING JAN 19TH?CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IN 4 YEARS I NEED 4 NEW BATTERIES?     TODAY JAN 28TH, I GOT A CALL FROM ACURA CORPORATE THAT THEY CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT IS DRAINING MY CAR BATTERY AND WHY I'M HAVING BATTERY ISSUES. THEY WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A DEFECTIVE CAR! SOMETHING IS KILLING MY BATTERY!!!! I WORK AT A HOSPITAL AND I TAKE ER CALLS FOR TRAUMA PATIENTS. IF MY CAR IS UNRELIABLE AND NOT STARTING, IT IS PUTTING MY PATIENTS LIFE AT HIGH RISK AND AFFECTING MY WORK ETHICS. WHY DOESN'T MY CAR START? WHY DOES MY CAR STALL WHEN TRYING TO START FOR 4 YEARS? WHY DO I NEED 4 NEW BATTERIES IN 4 YEARS? I HAVE VIDEOS OF MY CAR HARD START/ STALLING ISSUE WHICH I CANNOT ATTACH ON HERE.     IF MY CAR DOES NOT START IN AN EMERGENCY CASE, IT IS ENDANGERING MY LIFE AND THE PEOPLE RELYING ON ME AS WELL.",
