PART OF THE FUNCTION IS TO STIFFEN THE SUSPENSION IF SWITCHED INTO SPORT MODE BUT THE LACK OF OIL FLUID WILL PREVENT IT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.    A SIMILAR ISSUE OCCURRED WITH AUDI RS4 AND RS4 LEAKING SHOCKS.  OWNERS WERE OFFERED BY AUDI REPLACEMENT IMPROVED SHOCK OR REIMBURSE THEM IF THEY HAVE ALREADY REPLACED THEM EVEN IF OUT OF WARRANTY.  THOSE OWNERS AND R8 OWNERS WERE WORRIED ABOUT SUSPENSION FAILURE AGAIN SINCE THE FAULTY SHOCKS ARE PRONE TO FAIL AGAIN SO THEY FELT BEST TO REPLACE THEM WITH OTHER NON MAGNETIC SHOCKS.PRIOR TO THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM WAS ANNOUNCED.      SOME OWNERS HAD LEAKING SHOCKS WHEN OUT OF WARRANTY BUT WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES.  MY R8 HAD 12,000 MILES WHEN ALL THE SHOCKS WERE DISCOVERED TO BE LEAKING.  I ONLY DISCOVERED THIS ISSUE WHEN I READ ABOUT THE COMMON ISSUE ON A R8 FORUM.  MANY MORE OWNERS THAT ARE NOT PART OF R8 FORUMS WILL NOT KNOW OF THIS COMMON ISSUE.  DRIVERS DO NOT EXPECT PREMATURE SUSPENSION FAILURE AND IT IS SAFETY ISSUE.  UNKNOWING OWNERS WOULD EXPECT THE SHOCKS TO NOT FAIL AND CAN SAFELY GO OVER BUMPS OR POT HOLES WITHOUT POSSIBLY LOSING CONTROL OF THE CAR. MOREOVER, FAILED SHOCKS COULD CAUSE STRUCTURE DAMAGE TO THE CAR SINCE IT IS ABSORBING ALL THE VIBRATIONS.    CROSS REFERENCE: NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10036971, 10036488",
