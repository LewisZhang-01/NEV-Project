In addition and after many calls an a few visits to the dealership they haven't been able to address nor fix the fluttering in the hood and rear bumper which we consider is really dangerous.

Several people have this issue and I\u2019ve posted it on my social media as well! I\u2019ve been told by the dealer the hood won\u2019t blow off and I informed them they cannot guarantee me that especially since they didn\u2019t make it the manufacturer\u2019s did! I pray for my safety and the safety of others but I am ready to sue Mitsubishi for this Lemon they sold me knowing it had a hood flutter issue! I have documentation of every person time and conversation as well as voicemails left  please help me!",

It is a very unsettling and unsafe feeling when driving on the highway. You feel as though the hood is going to open up and smash against the windshield. When driving on surface streets where there are bumps in the road, the hood moves a lot. The technical bulletin by Mitsubishi Motors: TSB-21-42A-001 references a hood latch and bumper height adjustment to alleviate the hood fluttering. In reality, the complete hood assembly is unstable. The hood needs to have internal bracing, as well as under hood cross member strength and adhesion, and/or thicker gauge metal for the hood's strength. I was driving on the freeway from the dealership and noticed this. I went back to the dealership to inquire about returning the vehicle. I was informed of my rights, that they had expired after the contract and financing went through and I drove it off the sales lot. Since I am unable to return this vehicle due to this safety issue, I want to make a formal request for a solution. A flimsy hood does not seem reasonable for insurance obligation purposes. What could possibly happen after a while is metal stress fatigue cracking due to movement. A serious injury could occur if the hood was to break loose. The weather strip seal cushion gasket does not alleviate the flutter. I included photos to show where the flex occurs.",
