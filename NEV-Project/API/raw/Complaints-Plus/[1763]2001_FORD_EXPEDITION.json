THAT DRIVER PULLED UP ASIDE OF ME AND TOLD ME YOU JUST DROPPED YOUR DRIVESHAFT. SINCE IT WAS DARK AND MY VEHICLE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AT AN INTERSECTION I CALLED THE POLICE. WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY TOLD ME WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR TOW TRUCK DRIVER TO GET HERE, IT'S TO DANGEROUS, SO THEY CALLED ANOTHER TOWING COMPANY. WELL AFTER A LONG HASSLE AND THE 1ST TOW OF $150.00, I GOT MY VEHICLE TOWED TO MY HOUSE. AFTER MAKING SEVERAL PHONE CALLS I FINALLY GOT IT TOWED TO THE REPAIR SHOP ON 7/8/13 AND HAD TO PAY ANOTHER TOW OF $75.00. FINALLY GOT THE CALL ON 7/10/13 WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MY ROTTED OUT EXPEDITION, ALL 4 CONTROL ARMS WHERE RUSTED OUT, 2 OF THEM ACTUALLY BENT AND BROKE, DAMAGING MY DRIVESHAFT. COSTING ME ANOTHER $559.14 FOR THE REPAIR. THAT'S ONLY FIXING THE 2 LOWER CONTROL ARMS. THEY HAVE TO FIND THE 2 UPPER AND REPLACE THEM. WHICH WILL BE AT LEAST ANOTHER $350.00 THIS ISN'T EVEN MENTIONING THE $1,000.00 I SPENT ON THE RUSTED OUT ROTTED RADIATOR BRACKETS NOT EVEN A YEAR AGO. I WAS TOLD AND EXPECT RUST BUT THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, AND ALSO TOLD FORD COULD HAVE COATED THIS PARTS OR MADE THEM STRONGER TO AVOID  THESE SERIOUS RUST PROBLEMS. LUCKILY I ONLY GOT MUSCLE SPASMS IN MY BACK, SHOULDER, AND LOWER NECK FROM THIS. BUT I DON\"T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ANY MORE. THIS IS MY LAST FORD I WILL EVER PURCHASE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!   FORD = FOUND ON ROADSIDE DEAD !!!  THIS STORY IS ALSO SHORTENED BUT THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED, I DIDN'T MENTION THE HEAT, THE ASTHMA ATTACK I HAD, AND THE HASSLE I WENT THROUGH WHILE ALL THIS OCCURRED.  *TR",

I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN AND LIVE IN AN AREA WITH NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SO I AM NOW WITHOUT A VEHICLE AND NO WAY TO GET TO WORK AND SUPPORT MY FAMILY, NOW WHAT DO I DO? ITS AMAZING HOW THIS DEALERSHIP CAN SWOOP YOU IN AND TAKE YOUR MONEY AND REQUIRE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PAYMENTS ON TIME BUT WON'T PROVIDE YOU WITH A SAFE VEHICLE. I NOW HAVE TO GET A CAB TO PICK MY KIDS UP FROM DAYCARE BECAUSE I CAN'T DRIVE MY TRUCK, NOT TO MENTION WHEN YOU GET INSIDE IT SMELLS LIKE PURE SMOKE WHICH MAKES IT SCARY TO EVEN WANNA TURN THE THING ON.

ONCE AGAIN, I WAS NEVER MADE AWARE OF ANY ISSUES NOW A POSSIBLE $600.00 PLUS BILL. THEY ORDERED THE PARTS TODAY. THIS IS DEFINITELY A FORD PROBLEM NOT AN ED PROBLEM. HOW MANY OTHERS ARE RIDING AROUND IN THESE TIME BOMBS? THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. ED CORLEY *TR",

I PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND THEN BACK INTO DRIVE AND IT SEEMED FINE. IT BEGAN HAPPENING MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY. ON ONE OCCASION IN 2003 I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND IT LOCKED UP. IT WENT INTO 4 WHEEL DRIVE AND LUCKILY I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT BECAUSE THE FORCE WAS COMPARABLE TO SLAMMING ON MY BRAKES. I DROVE OFF THE FREEWAY AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF 4 WHEEL DRIVE BUT WAS TERRIFIED TO DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHO TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T LOOK AT IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING. RELUCTANTLY I DROVE IT HOME. I WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE WHILE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY. WHILE DRIVING MY VEHICLE THROUGH A PARKING LOT IT DECIDED TO GO INTO 4 WHEEL DRIVE AND COMPLETELY LOCKED UP. I COULD NOT DRIVE IN FORWARD OR REVERSE. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP WHO TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE THAT COULD BE FIXED BUT THAT MY WARRANTY DID NOT COVER IT. ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS LATER I DROVE OFF WITH MY VEHICLE BELIEVING THAT IT WOULD WORK PROPERLY. WITHIN LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF THE REPAIR I WAS ON THE FREEWAY AGAIN AND MY 4 WHEEL DRIVE KICKED IN. ONCE AGAIN SAVED BY THE SEATBELT, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP. AGAIN I WAS TOLD THAT THE REPAIRS WERE ONLY COVERED FOR 1 YEAR OR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MILES (NOT SURE ON THE MILES ?5000). THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS NOT AN UNKNOWN PROBLEM THAT FORD WAS HAVING. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS BUT ALL THEY COULD DO WAS KEEP FIXING IT. THE DEALERSHIP EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT WHEN IT STARTS TO BIND UP TO PUT THE VEHICLE INTO REVERSE. VERY HELPFUL WHEN YOUR DOING 65 ON THE FREEWAY. TODAY WHILE ACTUALLY USING MY 4 WHEEL DRIVE THE TRANSMISSION CONTINUALLY SLIPPED.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD BY THE FEMALE OPERATOR (CHARLOTTE) TO BRING MY VEHICLE TO BOWDITCH FORD AND TO HAVE THEM RUN A DIAGNOSTICS TEST.  MY VEHICLE WENT OFF TO THE SHOP VIA FLATBED AS TO NOT CAUSE ANY FURTHER DAMAGE.  I LATER RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD COST $92.50, I OK'ED IT BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE TRITON ENGINE AND FOUND THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM. IN THE MEANTIME I WAS STILL IN CONTACT WITH FORD AND HAD EVEN TALKED TO AN OPERATOR NAMED RALPH.  I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO NEARLY 800,000 VEHICLES AND SOME RESULTING IN DEATH.  DEARBORN, MI SAID THEY WOULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND WOULD CONTACT ME THURSDAY.  THURSDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS CONTACTED BY DEARBORN AGAIN.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES MYSELF.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BY DEARBORN TO ASK THE DEALERSHIP, \"WHO RECEIVES CERTAIN ALLOCATED FUNDS EACH YEAR FOR REPAIRS JUST LIKE THIS\". THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED ASSISTANCE.  AFTER ALL WAS DONE I WAS CHARGED FOR AN ECSD DIAGNOSE (92.50); 2 SPARK PLUGS (6.81); 1 COIL ASSEMBLY IGNITION (103.69); FUEL INGESTION CLEANER (6.47) ANOTHER VEHICLE KEY ?  (30.00); MISC DRIVABILITY CHARGE (92.50); PCM REPROGRAMMING THE COMPUTER? (92.50); CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY (78.75); CLEAN THE INJECTORS? (65.00).

HOWEVER A FEW MILES LATER, I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG AND PULLED OFF OF THE FREEWAY.  I CALLED 911 SOMETIME BETWEEN 3 AND 3:15 PM 4/21/06 FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.

C) THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO THE UNDERCARRIAGE AS WELL AS CABLES.   EST. MILEAGE: 47600.  3. TIM THE TOWMAN REPLACED THE SHREDDED TIRE WITH MY FULL-SIZE SPARE. HE USED TWINE TO TEMPORARILY SUPPORT THE RF BUMPER. HE TEMPORARILY SECURED THE TIRE CASING. THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER NO-SERVICE. THEY SAID THAT A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WOULD NEED TO CORROBORATE MY STORY BEFORE THEY COULD DETERMINE WHETHER FORD WAS LIABLE TO REPLACE THE SHREDDED TIRE (AND POSSIBLY REPLACE ALL OF THE OTHERS, AS WELL), AND TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS NEEDED ON THE FRONT BUMPER AND CASING.  THE TALLAHASSEE FORD DEALERSHIP HAS A POOR REPUTATION, SO I WAS PERMITTED TO TAKE MY EXPEDITION TO THE LINCOLN-MERCURY DEALERSHIP. AFTER HEARING MY STORY AND EXAMINING MY VEHICLE, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT FORD OFFERED NO WARRANTY ON THE REPLACEMENT TIRES.  EVEN IF THEY HAD REPLACED DEFECTIVE TIRES WITH DEFECTIVE TIRES, THEY DID NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  HE OFFERED TO GIVE ME A DISCOUNT ON MICHELIN TIRES (FOUR) TO REPLACE THE CONTINENTAL TIRES.

AFTER 9 INSTANCES OF TAKING THE VEHICLE TO FORD OVER A 3 YEAR PERIOD, TOWING THE VEHICLE IN, AND WORKING WITH THEM ON WHAT WAS WRONG, I WAS TOLD THAT TOP FORD ENGINEERS SAID IT WAS ACCEPTABLE THAT IF A FORD VEHICLE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL POWER DRAIN THAT IT WAS OKAY IF THE VEHICLE COULD HOLD A CHARGE FOR 2 WEEKS.

SINCE THE EXPEDITION IS MY 2ND VEHICLE I ONLY DRIVE IT ONCE A MONTH OR SO.  IF I DO NOT KEEP THE BATTERY CHARGED VIA EXTERNAL CHARGER THE BATTERY WILL DIE.  ONE NOTE HERE IS THAT THE AMPERAGE DRAW TO GROUND ON THE VEHICLE AT ALL TIMES IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL SPARKING IF THE BATTERY CABLES ARE LOOSE OR REMOVED.  THIS ALSO WAS DEEMED OKAY BY FORD.  THIS CAUSES ME ENOUGH CONCERN THAT I WILL NOT PARK THIS VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE OF MY HOME DUE TO FEAR OF FIRE.  BUT THE VEHICLE COST ENOUGH THAT I CAN'T SIMPLY REPLACE IT.

AT 47,000 MILES ON THE TIRES WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS I FELT SEVERE SHAKING OF THE VEHICLE, I PULLED OFF OF THE ROAD AND INSPECTED THE TIRES. ONE OF THE TIRES (RIGHT REAR) SHOWED EXTENSIVE TREAD SEPARATION VERY NEAR TOTAL FAILURE. ONLY MY GOOD JUDGEMENT AVERTED A POSSIBLE DISASTER. I WENT TO MY FORD DEALER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TIRES, THEY SAID THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH NEW TIRES. WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LINE THEY SAID THAT THE TIRES HAD TOO MANY MILES. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER SET OF GENERAL TIRES EVER. I FEEL THAT BOTH FORD AND CONTINENTAL (GENERAL) AND RESPONSIBLE AND SHOULD REPLACE THESE TIRES WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE 2 YEARS AGO WHEN THE OTHERS WERE RECALLED.

THE REASON FOR THIS LETTER IS NOT ONLY TO INFORM YOU OF MY DISGUST, BUT ALSO TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TIRE CAUSED CLOSE TO $3,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE AND ALSO PUT MY FAMILY AND I IN DANGER ON THAT DAY AND EVERY OTHER DAY WE DROVE ON GENERAL TIRES.

TWICE I WAS PULLING INTO MY GARAGE, ONCE PULLING INTO A INSTANT OIL CHANGE STATION  ONCE PULLING INTO A CAR WASH.  EACH TIME I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE TRUCK BEFORE STRIKING ANYTHING USING THE BRAKES.  PULLING INTO THE OIL CHANGE STATION I WAS VERY STARTLED AS THE MECHANIC WAS GUIDING ME INTO THE STALL AND IF I HAD NOT REACTED AS QUICKLY AS I DID I'M CERTAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER BY TELEPHONE AND THEY STATED THAT NO ONE HAD REPORTED ANY SIMILAR INCIDENTS.  I ALSO HAD THE TRUCK EXAMINED BY ANOTHER FORD DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT LOCATE ANY \"CODES\" NOR COULD THEY DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE OWNED MORE THAN 25 VEHICLES DURING MY LIFETIME AND THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME.  THIS IS ALSO MY SECOND FORD EXPEDITION, NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED WITH THAT TRUCK EITHER.

THIS SEAT HAS AN ARM/BAR THAT IS PART OF THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM.  THE ARM BROKE WHILE DRIVING ON A LOCAL HIGHWAY.  THE RESTRAINT WAS INTACT WHEN SON PLACED IN THE SEAT.  AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES OF DRIVING (1/2 WAY INTO OUR TRIP) MY OLDER SON NOTICED THE ARM WAS LOOSE.  THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ARM HAD SNAPPED AND WAS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE SEATBACK.  THE JOINT IS LIKE A BALL AND SOCKET WITH A SPRING.  I THOUGHT THE \"BALL\" OF THE ARM HAD COME OUT OF THE \"SOCKET\" OF THE SEATBACK, BUT IN FACT THE ARM HAD BROKEN BEFORE THE JOINT.  THE PLASTIC COMPLETELY SNAPPED.  MY SON THAT WAS IN THE CARSEAT IS ONLY 15 MONTHS OLD.  IT AMAZES ME THAT A 15 MONTH OLD CAN BREAK PART OF A RESTRAINT SYSTEM AND IT SCARES ME TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD WE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE PURCHASED A NEW CARSEAT AND CHOSE A 5-POINT SYSTEM VS. A SEAT WITH AN ARM/BAR.  I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SAFE.  THANK YOU.*AK",
