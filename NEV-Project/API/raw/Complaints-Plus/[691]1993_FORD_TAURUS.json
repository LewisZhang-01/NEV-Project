I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I WENT TO YOUR WEBSITE AND BROUGHT UP THE INFORMATION ON MY '93 TAURUS. THE AMOUNT OF TSB'S THAT AFFECT MY CAR ASOUNDED ME. I HAVE PAID FOR REPAIRS TO SOME, AND THOUGHT OTHERS WERE JUST AGE ISSUES. THESE TSB'S THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY AUTOMOBILE INCLUDED; 93-23-6,94-19-4,94-16-3,96-7-5,96-15-3,95-3-4,96-22-1,93-3-9,&95-19-1. AS I STATED, THIS CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MY FAMILY. WHY HASN'T FORD TRIED TO CONTACT US ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES? ON ONE OF THESE TSB'S, WE DEVELOPED A LEAK IN A COOLING LINE. THE DEALERSHIP CHAGED US $360 FOR REPAIRS, WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COVERED BY FORD, WE WERE ONLY REIMBUSED $60. FORD SAID THE DEALER SHOULD REIMBURSE US THE BALANCE, AND THE DEALER SAID THAT FORD SHOULD REIMBURSE US. GUESS WHAT, EXCEPT FOR THE $60, WE NEVER GOT REIMBUSED THE ADDITIONAL $300. I AM AT WITS END.

IT HAD 37,000 MILES ON IT. AFTER OWNING IT FOR ONLY 40 DAYS, THE ENGINE BLEW ON MY WAY TO TENNESSEE. THE REPAIR SHOP CHECKED IT IN WITH ONLY 39,488 MILES ON IT. THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE ENGINE LONGBLOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $5532.27.   LET ME GIVE YOU A BRIEF PICTURE OF MY SITUATION. I AM A WIDOW LIVING ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND A SMALL PENSION FROM MY FORMER HUSBAND??S EMPLOYER. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT THAT IS BASED ON INCOME. I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE THE CAR FOR $6957.00 WITH THE MONEY I RECEIVED WHEN MY MOTHER-IN-LAW PASSED AWAY. AFTER PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS, THE COST OF THE CAR BECAME $12,492.27. THIS AMOUNT WOULD HAVE PAID FOR A MUCH NEWER CAR, BUT I WAS TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY FOR LIVING EXPENSES. I HAVE GLAUCOMA, DIABETES AND OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS. DUE TO MY GLAUCOMA, I WILL NOT BE DRIVING MUCH LONGER AND AS IT STANDS I DON??T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR FOR ANY DISTANCE. I WOULD LOVE TO VISIT FRIENDS WHILE I CAN, BUT I ALSO CANNOT AFFORD TO REPAIR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT GO WRONG. ALL I AM ASKING FOR IS TO BE REIMBURSED WHAT IT COSTS ME TO REPAIR THE ENGINE. WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE CAR, THEY SAID IF IT HAD HAPPENED IN THE AREA, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP. I FEEL THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. WHY SHOULD I BUY A CAR ONLY TO TRAVEL IN THE AREA OF THE DEALERSHIP.  FORD HAS REPAIRED OVER 100 CARS DUE TO ENGINE PROBLEMS AND IN MARCH OF 2000 THEY PROMISED TO COMPENSATE ENGINE CLAIMS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. FORD ASSURED THAT CLAIMS WOULD BE MORE THOUGHTFULLY HANDLED. SINCE 1986, FORD TAURUS??S HAVE HAD SEVERAL SERVICE BULLETINS IN REGARDS TO ENGINE PROBLEMS, MULTIPLE SAFETY-RELATED RECALLS, SECRET WARRANTIES AND SERVICE ADJUSTMENTS.   I HOPE THIS LETTER GETS TO THE CORRECT PERSON. IF YOU CAN NOT HELP ME, PLEASE TELL ME WHO CAN.  TS",

WE HAVE REPORTED THIS TO FORD AND TO FORD DEALERSHIP MECHANICS AND THEY HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS SUCH AS THIS.  WE HAVE TO OPEN THE HOOD AND LET THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT COOL DOWN. WHEN THE COMPARTMENT COOLS DOWN THEN THE CAR STARTS RIGHT UP AND RUNS UNTIL IT STOPS AGAIN.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. THE CAR JUST STOPS IN FRONT OF OTHER CARS AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO PULL OFF ONTO THE SHOULDER OR GRASS OR WHATEVER IS THERE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS ASAP. I NOTICE THAT OTHER TAURUS CARS HAVE THEIR HOODS OPEN WHEN THEY ARE DRIVING. I AM SURE THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. FORD NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM RIGHT AWAY.

THE SPRING THAT THAT OPERATES THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK THE BELTS BROKE AND YOU CANNOT USE  SEAT BELTS BECAUSE THE LATCH WILL NOT HOLD THE BUCKLE AS YOU FTRY TO LOCK IT ON.  WHEN I WENT TO FORD ABOUT THIS, THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A RECALL ITEM AND THAT THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THEM.  I HAD TO PURCHASE A COMPLETE SET OF SIX NEW LATCHES FOR THE CAR AS THEY DID NOT SELL INDIVIDUAL LATCHES.  THIS IS CRAZY AS A SEAT BELT IS A MANDATORY SAFETY ITEM AND IN NY YOU WILL RECEIVE A POLICE SUMMONS FOR NOT WEARING THEM.  THIS ITEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY FORD AT NO CHARGE.  I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED OCCURRANCE AS MY EX-WIFE HAS A 1989 TAURUS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND SHE HAD THE SAME RESULTS WITH FORD.  WE BOTH HAD TO PURCHASE FULL SETS OF SEAT BELT LATCHES TO REPLACE INOPERATIVE FRONT ONES.  THIS CERTAINLY SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FORD TO PROVIDE SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAT IS MANDATORY TO USE. HOW COULD I OPERATE MY CAR IN NY OR ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT A SET OF OPERATING SEAT BELTS?  I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY TO THIS SAFETY ISSUE THAT FORD HAS REFUSED TO RESPOND TO.  THANK YOU",

THE TIRES WERE DUE FOR ROTATION AND BALANCE, SO I HAD WAL-MART IN BAYTOWN, TEXAS PERFORM THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND CHECK THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE FOR A LEAK.  AFTER THE MECHANIC REMOVED THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE FROM THE RIM HE DISCOVERED A CRACK ON THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE TIRE. THE CRACK RAN PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION OF TREAD. THE CRACK RAN ACROSS THE TREAD AREA AND UP INTO BOTH SIDEWALLS.  THE CRACK WAS NOT VISIBLE ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE TIRE.  I LOOKED AT THE TIRE AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A SLIGHT MOLD INDENTATION IN THE CRACK AREA.  I CONTACTED GOODYEAR'S CONSUMER INFORMATION SERVICE AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE SAME INFORMATION.

I VISITED WAL-MART YESTERDAY 12/23/2000, AND SPOKE TO THE STORE MANAGER AND MECHANIC.  THEY AGREED TO CHECK THE REMAINING THREE TIRES FOR PROBLEMS NEXT WEEK.

SERVICE MANAGER).  DAN WALKED TO MY CAR TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIGHT BEING ON.  HE EXPLAINED THAT 'HE' (I ASSUMED, THE MECHANIC) DIDN'T NOTICE THE LIGHT AT FIRST, BUT NOTICED IT LATER.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE AIRBAG MODULE HAD BEEN ALL TAPED UP AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT WAS ON.  I INFORMED HIM THAT MADE NO SENSE TO ME AND ASKED WHY HE HAD NOT INFORMED ME.  HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T TELL ME BECAUSE HE ASSUMED I HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, OR TAPED IT UP MYSELF.  I EMPHATICALLY INFORMED DAN THAT WAS NOT THE CASE!!

WE DISCOVERED A SMALL LEAK, WE FOUND IT TO BE COMING FROM THE HEATER HOSE.  WE DECIDED TO TRUST SIGNATURE FORD, THEY CLAIMED THAT WE NEEDED A NEW HEATER HOSE, WATER PUMP AND RADIATOR.  WE TOOK ARE CAR BACK TO THE FIRST MECHANIC WHO LOOKED AT IT AND HE SWORE THAT THOSE THINGS WERE NOT LEAKING WHEN THEY LEFT HIS SHOP, NO PROOF THOUGH SO WE HAVEN'T FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST SIGNATURE FORD.

WE HAD THE STARTER REPLACED AT SIGNATURE FORD, SINCE IT WAS FIXED THE KEYLESS ENTRY STOPPED WORKING.  WE'VE HAD THE BRAKES COMPLELY FIXED, THREE TIMES.  WE HAVE HAD THE OXYGEN SENSORS REPLACED.  THE AIRCONDITIONER WILL NOT WORK, WE WERE TOLD THAT WE NEED  A NEW COMPRESSOR AND CLUTCH.  THERE IS A SHORT THAT CAUSES A FUSE TO BLOW, RESULITING IN LOSS OF GAUGES.  ONE OF THE BACK WINDOWS WILL NOT WORK.  THE MOLDING AROUND SAID WINDOW DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY.  THE POWER STEERING MAKES A STRANGE NOISE AND SOMETIMES DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING; WE TOOK IT IN TO SIGNATURE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS FINE.  WHEN WE FIRST PURCHASED THE CAR THE TIRES THAT WERE ON IT WERE TOO BIG RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE WEAR.  THE CURRENT TIRES SHOW SIGNS OF EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE INSIDE FRONT PASSANGER TIRE.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN TOTALLY REBUILT, THE TECH. WHO FIXED IT SAID THAT THIS IS TYPICAL OF SHO'S.  THE FOG LIGHTS SOMETIMES FAIL.  THE LAMP OUT LIGHT COMES ON EVEN WHEN NO LAMP IS OUT.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON SOMETIMES DURING ACCELERATION.  THE DOOR AJAR LIGHT COMES ON AND GOES OFF AT VARIOUS TIMES.

TOOK THE CAR TO 2 DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION PEOPLE, AND THEY SAID THE TAURUS' TRANSMISSION IN ALL VEHICLES IS DEFECTIVE IN THAT IT IS MADE SO THAT THE TRANSMISSION OIL CANNOT GET TO ALL THE PARTS CAUSING BREAKDOWN.  THEY BOTH SAID I SHOULD GET RID OF THE VEHICLE AS EVEN IF I PUT A NEW TRANMISSION IN THE VEHICLE, THE NEW ONES ARE MADE EXACTLY THE SAME AND THE SAME PROBLEM WILL HAPPEN.  ON NHTSA COMPLAINT DIVISION, I FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION, YET THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL.  BECAUSE I GOT THE VEHICLE WITH 70000 MILES ON IT, FOR ALL I KNOW THE VEHICLE COULD BE ON ITS 3RD OR 4TH TRANSMISSION.  I INQUIRED ABOUT GETTING A USED TRANSMSSION, AND BOTH REPAIR MEN LAUGHED AND SAID GOOD LUCK, EVERY TAURUS STILL OPERATING HAS HAD  OR NEEDED A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT AND THUS THERE ARE NO USED TRANSMISSIONS AVAILABLE.  THE CAR BUCKS AND JERKS CONSTANTLY  AND VIOLENTLY EVEN AT LOW SPEEDS AND BECAUSE OF THE ABRUPT DOWNSHIFT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE, AND SO DO NOT DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE WINDOW SHIELD WIPERS FAIL AT THE WORST TIMES - SUCH AS DURING A DOWNPOUR WHEN YOUR'RE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT NIGHT, THEY WILL COMPLETELY STOP WITH NO WARNING, MAKING VISIBILITY IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND STOP.

FIRST, THE INTERVALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BRIEF. SECOND, THE LIGHTS MAY ALSO COME ON OR STAY ON WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE \"OFF\" POSITION. THIRD, WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON, THEY ARE MUCH TOO DIM. A REVIEW OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FOR THE 1993 TAURUS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE SHOWED MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. SO MANY, THAT I HAD NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE NEED TO REVIEW THEM ALL. I REVIEWED ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE COMPLAINTS AND FOUND 20 RELATING TO THE HEADLIGHTS. A FEW REFERRED TO THE CIRCUIT BREAKER OR A FAILURE TO HONOR THE RECALL. MANY REFERRED TO THE HEADLIGHTS GOING ON AND OFF, WHICH MAY BE THE CIRCUIT BREAKER, OR IT MAY BE THE SWITCH OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM. SOME REFER SPECIFICALLY TO THE SWITCH, PROBABLY BECAUSE A MECHANIC IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM OR BECAUSE JIGGLING THE SWITCH CAN TEMPORARILY \"FIX\" THE PROBLEM, OR BOTH--AS IN MY CASE.

I WAS TOTALLY WITHOUT SIGHT ON A BUSY SIX LANE CITY STREET IN A LOT OF TRAFFIC.  I HAD NOTICED MY WINDSHIELD WASHER DIDN'T WORK, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A MOTOR PROBLEM.  I WIRED THE MOTOR DIRECTLY TO THE BATTERY AND IT WORKED FINE.  I CALLED A LOCAL DEALER TO SEE IF THERE HAD BEEN A SAFETY RECALL SINCE I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR FROM A PRIVATE OWNER AND MIGHT NOT GET ALL THE NOTIFICATIONS. HE SAID NO, BUT WHEN I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM TO THE SERVICE TECH AND ASKED FOR ADVICE, HE SAID IT WAS COMMON THAT WIRES GET DAMAGED IN THE STEERING COLUMN AND THE LEVER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR ABOUT $160.  HE DIDN'T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND A SOLUTION AND THAT INDICATES TO ME IT ISN'T AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. I THEN CALLED AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP WHO HAS WORKED ON MY FORD PRODUCTS IN THE RECENT PAST.  HE KNEW ABOUT THE WIPER CONTROLS AND WIRING PROBLEM.  I ASKED HIM IF THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH TAURUS' AND HE SAID YES AMONG OTHER THINGS.  I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO HAVE THIS FIXED BEFORE A RECALL CAN BE EFFECTED, BUT I THOUGHT THIS IS SERIOUS AND LIKELY COMMON ENOUGH TO BRING IT TO YOUR ATTENTION.  IF I CAN WAIT, I WILL BECAUSE THE ESTIMATE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM RANGES FROM $160-$300 AND I THINK THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD COVER THIS DESIGN OR ASSEMBLY PROBLEM.

AFTER SEVERAL HOURS, WE WERE NOTIFIED BY ANOTHER FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CLERK THAT THIS PARTICULAR RECALL WAS SUBJECT TO A 60,000 MILE LIMITATION (THIS WAS NOT INDICATED ON THE INTERNET SITE OR BY THE FIRST CLERK).  FURTHER MORE, DISCUSSIONS WITH A SERVICE MANAGER FROM ANOTHER LOCAL FORD DEALER HAD INDICATED THAT FORD HAS HAD A LOT OF PRE-MATURE FAILURES WITH THE 3.8L HEAD GASKETS AND THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY THAT THE EXCESSIVE SHOCK AND VIBRATIONS FROM THE BROKEN MOTOR MOUNT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HEAD GASKET FAILURE.
