The contact pulled off the highway and found no visible damage or reason for the deployment. The contact had taken the vehicle back to the dealer on two separate occasions for an inspection; however, the contact was never given a cause for the failure. The contact then took the vehicle to an independent mechanic who refused to service the vehicle since the cause of the deployment had not been determined. The manufacturer had been notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 150,000.",

While using the high beams, the bulbs work as intended. The light bulbs and relays were promptly replaced and the issue is not fixed. It is often caused the a malfunctioning multiswitch that controls lighting and blinkers. The issue is well known within Honda elements and a previous recall have been issued for other Honda models including the Honda civic. Oftentimes the wiring goes back due to the switch malfunctioning. This is extremely unsafe toward everyone on the road as we lack visibility and by using high beams, we unwantingly blind other drivers which could result in injury by other drivers, passengers, and even pedestrians.",

ONE CRACK EMANATED FROM THE LOWER CORNER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, ONE FROM APPROXIMATELY MID-POINT ON A-PILLAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, AND ONE FROM THE LOWER DRIVER'S SIDE CORNER.

THE CRACKS OCCURRED AT SEPARATE TIMES AND AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THREE OF THE FOUR CRACKS WERE STARBURST CRACKS AND HAVE NOT SPREAD.  ONE OF THE STARBURST CRACKS OCCURRED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE SMALL STONE CAUSE THE CRACK.  I HEARD THE SUBSEQUENT TWO STARBURST CRACKS OCCUR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.

I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH A SMALL CRACK, BUT DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON PROBLEMS WITH THE HONDA ELEMENT AND FOUND SEVERAL INCIDENCES OF A CRACK IN THE WINDOW STARTING IN THE SAME PLACE. I EVEN FOUND A HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB 03-028)  THAT ADDRESSED THIS EXACT PROBLEM. I PURCHASED MY 04 HONDA ELEMENT IN MID-DECEMBER OF 2004, AND AT THE TIME OF THE CRACK THE CAR HAD LESS THAN 10,000 MILES.   I HAVE READ THAT IF THERE WAS AN IMPACT POINT THAT CAUSED THE CRACK, THAT IMPACT POINTS ALWAYS HAVE A STAR CRACK PATTERN AROUND THEM. MINE HAS NO CRACK PATTERN EXCEPT THE LARGER CRACK THAT MOVED UPWARD AND THEN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF MY WINDSHIELD - NO STAR SHAPE. I HAVE ALSO READ ABOUT THE SURFACE OF THE WINDSHIELD BEING UNEVEN AND THAT A HIGH SPOT APPLIES UNEVEN PRESSURE TO THE GLASS CAUSING A STRESS CRACK.  FURTHER, THAT A STRESS CRACK IS IDENTIFIED BY A HORIZONTAL CRACKS ORIGINATING IN THE LOWER CORNERS OF THE AND RADIATING TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THIS IS EXACTLY MY PROBLEM. I REPEAT, THE PIT WAS SMALLER THAN THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF SALT AND LOCATED DIRECTLY UNDER THE WIPER BLADE. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, AND WAS TURNED AWAY WHEN I TRIED TO HAVE MY WINDOW REPAIRED. THIS SITUATION IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY HONDA ELEMENT.
