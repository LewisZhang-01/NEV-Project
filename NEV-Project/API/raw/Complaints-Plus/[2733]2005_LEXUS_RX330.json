RESEARCH HAS SHOWN ME THAT THIS IS A KNOW ISSUE, AND MANY CONSUMERS HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAIN. ON CONTACTING LEXUS, I WAS INFORMED THAT SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY PERIOD, THERE NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE, THERE WAS A CHANNEL 2 SAN DIEGO, CA CLIP ON TOYOTA MOTORS HAVING A RECALL, BUT I WAS INFORMED NO SUCH RECALL IS IN FORCE, SO I AM CONFUSED. LEXUS CONTACT ME AND READY TO PAY A PARTIAL SUM ON THE PART REPLACEMENT BUT I WOULD HAVE TO BEAR THE LABOR AND MUCH OF THE COST ASSOCIATED FOR THE PART. A SIMILAR STORY THAT ECHOED WITH OTHER USERS, LEXUS NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS RECALL/SAFETY ISSUE AT ONCE, BEFORE A FATALITY OCCURS.",

AS I PROCEEDED TO TAKE A LEFT HAND TURN THE CAR STARTED MAKING A LOUD NOISE.  IT WAS JUMPING AND SHIFTING FROM SIDE TO SIDE. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL IT AND PULL INTO A NEARBY GAS STATION.  I COULDN'T DRIVE IT AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST LEXUS SERVICE CENTER.  I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THE TRANSFER CASE ON THE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL WENT.  THEY OPENED UP THE CASE BOX AND METAL SHAVINGS FELL OUT!  I GUESS THERE WAS NO TRANSFER CASE FLUID!  SHOULDN'T A MAINTENANCE REQUIRED LIGHT POP ON OR A WARNING? IF I HAD CONTINUED ON THE HIGHWAY RATHER THAN GET OFF THE EXIT, IT WOULD HAVE ENDED BADLY!  THE BACK END OF THE CAR COMPLETELY LOCKED ON ME.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT.  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT THE TRANSFER CASE IS RUNNING OUT OF FLUID?  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THIS IS NOT NORMAL.  THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME $2700 FOR THE PART AND $1500 FOR LABOR!  I ENDED UP HAVING THE CAR TOWED BACK TO MY HOUSE UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.  I HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING AND HAD I BEEN TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED, I COULD HAVE FLIPPED THE CAR AND ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL OR DEAD.

THEN I WOULD HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKES HARDER IN ORDER FOR THE VEHICLE TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THIS WAS AT 5MPH OR LESS. I BELIEVE IT'S THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED UNIT FOR THE GAS.

THE HID HEADLIGHTS WERE STOLEN TWICE AND I AM HAVING SCARY NIGHTS AFTER SPENDING 40K ON THIS LUXURY SUV.         ONE OF THE BIG REASON WHY I WENT FOR RX 330 FROM THE OTHER BRANDS WAS THE KNOWN QUALITY OF SERVICE AND RELIABILITY OF THE LEXUS BRAND.  BUT NOW I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.  LEXUS SHOULD NOTIFY EVERYONE WHO HAS THE XENON HEADLIGHTS TO DO THE ENHANCED SECURITY FOR HEADLIGHTS.  BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL I CONTACTED THEM. MEANWHILE I CONTACTED LEXUS AFTER THE 2 THEFTS AND THEY INSTALLED THE DATA DOTS AND ANTI THEFT BRACKETS WHICH THEY SAY MAY PREVENT THEFTS.  IT HAS BEEN DONE A WEEK BACK AND HOPE THIEVES MAY NOT STEAL IT AGAIN SEEING THE DATA DOTS.  THESE DATADOTS WONT PREVENT THEFT BUT THEY JUST WARN THE THIEF.  EXTRA BRACKETS MAKES THEIR JOB A BIT HARD, BUT THEY CAN EASILY TAKE IT BY DOING MORE DAMAGE TO THE HOOD.      FIRST THEFT       -  5000 K LOSS  SECOND THEFT   - 6000 K LOSS    I HAVE ONLY THIS SUGGESTION.  1)NO ONE CAN PREVENT THEFTS. MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS LEXUS  OR DEALERS SHOULD WARN THE CUSTOMERS IN NJ AND NY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HEADLIGHT THEFTS OR THEY SHOULD NOTIFY ALL OWNERS TO INSTALL SOME SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS FOR THESE HEADLIGHTS.  2)WHY CUSTOMERS RISK THEIR LIFE AND PEACEFUL NIGHTS BY SPENDING 40K FOR LUXURY VEHICLES AND  AGAIN RISK TO SPEND 250-500K FOR DEDUCTIBLES EVERY MONTH.  I REALLY WORRY THAT NEXT TIME INSURANCE COMPANY MAY BE UNWILLING TO GIVE INSURANCE TO MY VEHICLE TELLING THE AREA IS A HIGH RISK AREA.   3)REMOVING A LIVE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FROM AN ADVANCED MICRO COMPUTER CONTROLLED VEHICLE AND THE THEFT ALARMS JUST SITS DUMB.  I CANNOT BELIEVE WHY THIS VEHICLE AND THE HEADLIGHTS WAS DESIGNED LIKE THIS.  4)THE ENHANCED BRACKETS SHOULD BE SOME STRONG METALLIC STUFFS(NOW I GUESS ITS PLASTIC).   *NM",
