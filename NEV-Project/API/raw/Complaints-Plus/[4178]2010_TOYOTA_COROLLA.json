I EXPECTED A LONG WAIT FOR THIS TO RESOLVE, BUT TAKING NEARLY A YEAR IS BORDERING ON UNACCEPTABLE. WHEN CAN I EXPECT TOYOTA TO GET ON THE BALL?     THANKS",

AND WAS TOLD AT FIRST THEY HAD NO LOANER CARS, THEN WAS PLACED ON HOLD, REP SAID WE DO HAVE A LOANER BUT NOT TIL FEB 1, 2017. I SAID YOUVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS AND HOW UNFAIR THIS IS TO HAVE A VEHICLE I PAY A CAR NOTE FOR THATS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AND IN THE EVENT I GET A LOANER I HAVE TO STILL PAY FOR A PARKED CAR ALONG WITH INSURANCE, AND I WOULD HAVE TO INSURE THE LOANER VEHICLE. SO UNACCEPTABLE. I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER TO SEE IF THEY WILL TAKE CAR BACK, TRADE IN, OR BUY BACK. I AM TO GO IN FRIDAY TO SEE IF THIS IS POSSIBLE. I AM VERY FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF EMPATHY WHEN ITIS PERTAINING TO SOMEONES SAFETY AND THEIR CHILDRENS SAFETY.",

BEFORE RECEIVING THE OFFICIAL LETTER FROM TOYOTA FOR THIS RECALL, I HAD TAKEN MY CAR TO MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER BECAUSE FOR A TIME THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS TURNING ON AND STAYING ON LONGER THAN THE OTHER LIGHTS AFTER IGNITION. I HAD HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS AND WAS CONCERNED. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EARLY 2016, THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO RETURN UNLESS THE LIGHT STAYED ON DURING TRIPS. WHEN I ASKED THEM IF IT WAS SAFE TO HAVE SOMEONE SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, THEY SAID IT WAS FINE. THEN, MONTHS LATER, WHEN I GOT THE RECALL NOTICE FROM TOYOTA, THE LETTER CLEARLY STATED THAT, I SHOULD NOT HAVE ANYONE SITTING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN AGAIN, THEY SAID THEY WERE STILL WORKING ON A FIX AND THAT IT COULD TAKE MONTHS OR PERHAPS EVEN YEARS. APART FROM THE FACT I CANNOT USE MY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT FOR PEOPLE, THE MOST INFURIATING PART OF THIS IS THAT I WAS TOLD BY PEOPLE AT MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER (BEFORE RECEIVING THE OFFICIAL RECALL NOTICE), THAT I COULD SAFELY HAVE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. IN ADDITION, I HAVE DRIVEN FOR MONTHS CONCERNED ABOUT AN AIRBAG IN MY CAR WHICH COULD HARM OR KILL ME OR OTHER PEOPLE IN MY CAR.

I WAS TOLD THAT THE \"GAS CAP\" WAS THE PROBLEM AND THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE IT; I FOLLOWED THEIR RECOMMENDATION. BUT, ONE DAY AFTER THE SAME LIGHT APPEARED AGAIN.

THANK GOD, I AM STILL ALIVE! I TOOK THE CAR TO GERMAIN TOYOTA, THEY HAD URGED ME TO REPLACE THE \"BATTERY,\" WHICH I DID. THE PROBLEM RESURFACED THE DAY AFTER. THE SECOND TIME, THEY ASKED ME TO REPLACE THE \"ECU,\" WHICH I DID. THAT COST ME MORE THAN $800, CLOSE TO $900. THE THREE LIGHTS REAPPEARED AFTER TWO DAYS. I CAME BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO GERMAIN TOYOTA, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. LAST WEEK, THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER, I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THEM FOR THE SAME LIGHTS, AND THEY TOLD ME TO REPLACE AGAIN THE \"GAS CAP,\" I PAID ANOTHER MONEY, BUT THE SAME PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GO ON AND ON AND PERSIST EVERY WEEK.

I NEVER LET THE ENGINE RUN OVER 5000RPM EVEN WHEN I TESTED THE CAR AND ENGINE; MY MAXIMAL RUNNING RPM IS ABOUT 3000. THIS 8000RPM SHOULD NOT BE FROM MY OPERATION. I WAS NOT CONVINCED ON 'STICK PEDAL\" OR \"FLOOR MAT\" CAUSE FOR THIS CASE.    THE SEQUENCE \"TURNED OFF ENGINE, BRAKED\" MIGHT BE GOOD TO \"BRAKED TO STOP AND TURNED OFF ENGINE\" BECAUSE IT IS TOO HARD TO BRAKE WITH ENGINE OFF. BUT, WHEN YOU HEAR THE SCARY 8000RPM ROARING ENGINE, THE FIRST REACTION IS TURN IT OFF.    I HAVE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER.  *TR",

I HAVE SPOKEN TO TOYOTA IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT MY CAR AND MY CONCERN BUT THEY JUST TAKE MY INFORMATION AND SAY THAT THEY'LL PUT IT ON RECORD. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME. I KNOW OF ANOTHER CUSTOMER OF VILLAGE CADILLAC AND TOYOTA IN HOMOSASSA, FLORIDA (WHICH IS WHERE MY CAR WAS SERVICED) HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. ALSO THE PREVIOUS OWNER OF MY TOYOTA EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THE POWER STEERING.  I DO KNOW THAT TOYOTA CHANGED THE POWER STEERING TO AN ELECTRICAL TYPE POWER STEERING IN LATE 2009 BUT CHANGED IT BACK TO THEIR OLD SYSTEM BY LATE 2010, THIS TELLS ME THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND THIS IS 2013 AND THERE'S BEEN NO RECALL YET.

WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND HAD THE NEW ONE PUT IN. THE DAY AFTER IT WAS DONE, WE DROVE APPROXIMATELY 230 MILES ROUND TRIP, ALMOST ALL OF IT ON THE FREEWAY. WE WERE PLEASED TO FIND THAT THE STEERING WAS GOOD AND THE CAR TRACKED STRAIGHT. TWO DAYS LATER, WE DID THE SAME TRIP AND IMMEDIATELY KNEW SOMETHING WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THE STEERING WAS SUDDENLY FAR WORSE THAN BEFORE THE FIX. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE HYDROPLANING, DRIFTING, AND FLOATING SIDE TO SIDE, AND I HAD TO CONCENTRATE FULLY ON KEEPING THE CAR IN MY LANE. IT FELT MUCH LIKE DRIVING ON A WET, SLIPPERY SURFACE. I DROVE AWHILE BEFORE EXITING THE FREEWAY SO MY WIFE COULD TAKE IT FOR A \"TEST DRIVE\". SHE SAID IT WAS DOWNRIGHT SCARY. THEN MY COLLEGE-AGE SON GAVE IT A WHIRL. HE AGREED ABOUT THE SCARY PART, SAYING IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG. HE FINALLY PULLED INTO A REST STOP AND WE TURNED THE CAR OFF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ABOUT EIGHTY MILES SINCE WE HAD BEEN SWITCHING \"TEST\" DRIVERS WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. WHEN WE RESUMED DRIVING FROM THE REST AREA, THE STEERING WAS FINE. IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN TEN MINUTES BEFORE. THAT WAS THE END OF OUR TWO-HANDED, WHITE KNUCKLE DRIVING SESSION. WE CONTINUED TO OUR DESTINATION AND THEN BACK HOME WITH NORMAL STEERING. WE'VE OWNED TOYOTAS SINCE 1978. THIS IS OUR FIFTH COROLLA. WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN OUR LIVES, IN ANY CAR. IN OUR CASE, THIS CAME OUT OF THE BLUE, RIGHT AFTER WE THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOOD.

TOYOTA AND DEALERS MUST BE FULLY AWARE OF THESE CONCERNS BUT FAILED TO DECLARE UP FRONT. DURING OUR SECOND VISIT THEY TOLD US ABOUT TS 1040 AND REPLACED STEERING CONTROL COMPUTER BOARD. SEEMS WANDERING ISSUE IS GONE FOR NOW. BUT TIRES ARE PROBLEM AS I AM HAVING CONCERN FROM THE BEGINNING.    2. I FEEL HUMMING MILD VIBRATION/RESONANCE IN STEERING WHEEL WHEN WE CROSS 50-60 MPH. IT FEELS LIKE TIRES ARE VIBRATING THE STEERING WHEEL. REPLACING COMPUTER CONTROLLER DID NOT FIX MILD VIBRATION OF STEERING.    3. TIRES: AS I HAD DOUBT ABOUT TIRES THIS COULD BE  TIRES PROBLEM BUT TOYOTA SERVICE TEAM IS  NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FACT. ONCE YOU CROSS 62 MPH YOU CAN CLEARLY FEEL THE TIRE VIBRATION MAINLY IN A STEERING WHEEL AND ALSO ON THE VEHICLE. ROAD FORCE BALANCING HAS BEEN DONE BUT THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT. I AM NOT SURE IT IS ENGINE RELATED OR TIRES. I HAVE BEEN INSISTING ON REPLACING ANOTHER SET OF BETTER BALANCED TIRES OR DIFFERENT MAKE OF TIRES.",

THERE WAS NO WAY TO DRIVE THE CAR IN A STRAIGHT LINE. THE STEERING WHEEL FAILED COMPLETELY TO RESPOND TO ANY ATTEMPT TO TURN IT TO THE RIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE CAR AND ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE IT  IN STRAIGHT LINE. BRAKES AS WELL WERE NOT RESPONDING. ALL ATTEMPTS TO STOP THE CAR OR TURN IT TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID BUMPING THE RAILS  AND KEEP IT STRAIGHT IN THE LANE FAILED. I COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OVER THE CAR & IT STARTED FISHTAILING IN THE FRONT. THE CAR DIDN'T STOP UNTIL IT BUMPED INTO THE GUARDING RAIL, AT THIS MOMENT THE CAR JUST STOPPED AND IT TOOK THE CAR MORE THAN 20 FEED TO AUTOMATICALLY STOP BY IT SELF. I FAILED TO STOP IT.AT THIS MOMENT THE CAR CORRECTED ITS DIRECTION &WENT IN STRAIGHT LINE DIRECTION SCRUBBING AGAINST THE RAIL COMPLETELY DAMAGING THE ENTIRE  LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR BEFORE IT STALL. THEN ALL THE DASH BOARD LIGHTS AND CAR SOUNDS WENT ON AND THE CAR STALLED. THE CAR WAS NOT IN A DRIVABLE CONDITION SO I HAD TO TOW IT AWAY. I HAVE A WITNESS  WHO DESCRIBED MY ACCIDENT SAYING THAT MY CAR KEPT SWERVING TO THE LEFT & WAS AMBIGUOUSLY  UNCONTROLLED, HE WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK CARE OF ME AFTER THE CAR BUMPED THE RAIL.  THIS ACCIDENT IS A  LIFE THREATENING ACCIDENT NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT ALSO FOR OTHERS ON THE HW.

REMEMBERING WHAT TOYOTA CO SAID TO DO WHEN THEIR VEHICLES ARE SPEEDING OUT OF CONTROL, I PUT CAR IN NEUTRAL AND CONTINUED TO APPLY BRAKES, WHICH HAD NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER.      I CONTINUED TO SPEED DOWN DOUBLE-LINED ROAD, PASSING VEHICLES IN MY LANE.  THEN WHEN OTHER VEHICLES WERE COMING IN OTHER LANE IN MY DIRECTION, I WAS FORCED TO SLAM FULL SPEED INTO VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME IN MY LANE.  THIS CAUSED MY VEHICLE AND THAT VEHICLE TO ROLL OVER.      WHEN MY FAMILY AND I HAD FIRST HEARD OF THE RECALLS WITH TOYOTA IN FEBRUARY OF 2010, WE IMMEDIATELY TOOK CAR TO TOYOTA DEALER IN FL WHERE WE VACATIONED FOR THE WINTER.  WE WERE ASSURED THAT SINCE OUR VIN# INDICATED IT WAS JAPANESE-MADE, WE WERE NOT PART OF THE STICKING ACCELERATOR RECALL.   THEY TOLD US TO REMOVE DRIVER-SIDE FLOORMAT ANYWAY, WHICH WE IMMEDIATELY DID.      AS YOU CAN SEE, WE TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION POSSIBLE, AND AS MY CAR WAS CAREENING OUT OF CONTROL, I DID EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND IT DID NOT MATTER.  AND PLEASE DO NOT INSULT VICTIMS OF THESE TRAGEDIES BY INDICATING THAT IT IS POSSIBLY DRIVER ERROR.  CLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING MAJOR WRONG HERE AND THESE VEHICLES NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD.  *TR",

AT APPROXIMATELY 6:45AM, THE CAR'S RPM JUMPED FROM 2000-3000 TO 5000-6000.  AT THIS POINT, I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL...THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AUTOMATICALLY ON ITS OWN.  THEN, THE RPM'S JUMPED BACK DOWN TO 2000-3000.  I HAD TO CROSS THREE LANES IN ORDER TO PULL OVER.  WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PULL OVER, THE CAR WAS GOING VERY SLOW, BUT THE RPM'S WERE JUMPING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 2000-3000 TO 5000-6000.  THIS OCCURRED WHILE MY FOOT WAS OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND WHILE IT WAS HOVERING OVER THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I DID NOT PRESS THE BRAKES BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO COME TO A FULL STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF FAST MOVING TRAFFIC ON I-95.  THIS EVENT OCCURRED A TOTAL OF THREE TIMES BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND TURN OFF THE CAR.  THE SOUND THE CAR WAS MAKING WAS AS IF I WERE TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL.  I HAD NOT DONE ANY OF THIS DURING THE INCIDENT.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE FOR 10 MINUTES, AND I RESTARTED THE CAR.  I SLOWLY MADE MY WAY TO MY PARENTS HOUSE NEARBY. *TR",

DEAR HERITAGE TOYOTA,    I AM RETURNING THE TOYOTA COROLLA I PURCHASED FROM YOU LESS THAN 30 DAYS AGO.  I EXPECT A FULL REFUND AS PROVIDED BY STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES.  I FIND IT UNSAFE TO DRIVE.   THE VEHICLE DOES NOT TRACK STRAIGHT. IT TOO READILY REDIRECTS ITSELF FROM A STRAIGHT PATH, DRIFTING ALTERNATELY FROM TO RIGHT OR LEFT. MY DRIVING TIME IS SPENT INTENSELY CONCENTRATING ON CORRECTING THE RIGHT AND LEFT ADJUSTMENT THE VEHICLE HAS MADE ON ITS OWN. IT FEELS LIKE I AM DRIVING ON RAILS THAT I DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER OR THAT I AM DRIVING ON THE CREST OF A SEVERELY CROWNED ROAD AND THAT I MUST CONSTANTLY REDIRECT THE VEHICLE BACK UPHILL TO THE TOP PF THE CROWN.. THE STEERING DOES NOT HAVE A SWEET NEUTRAL SPOT; IT IS AS IF THE VEHICLE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO TURN AND IT MY JOB TO CORRECT ITS TURNING. THIS HAPPENS ON ALL ROADS AND AT ALL SPEEDS. IT HAPPENS BOTH WHEN I AM HOLDING ONTO THE STEERING WHEEL AND CONCENTRATING ON CORRECTING, AND ALSO WHEN I RELAX MY GRIP FROM THE WHEEL AND LET THE CAR 'TRACK' ON ITS OWN. THERE IS NO TIME I AM NOT WORKING TO KEEP THE CAR ON THE ROAD. IN ADDITION TO THE TYPICAL/USUAL TASK (THE JOY OF DRIVING) OF STEERING TO KEEP THE CAR ON THE ROAD, I AM FORCED TO ALSO STEER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RANDOM TURNS THE VEHICLE MAKES ON IT OWN.   I THOUGHT THE STEERING WOULD 'WEAR-IN' BUT I THINK IT IS GETTING WORSE.  THE LAST STRAW HAPPENED YESTERDAY (WHILE I WAS OUT OF TOWN), WHEN MY WIFE DROVE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, SHE CALLED ME TO ASK ME, 'WHAT I HAD DONE TO THE STEERING, BECAUSE SHE HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE CAR ON THE ROAD.'

THIS NOTICE ADVISES (UNDER \"WHAT IS THE CONDITION\"? \"IF THE VEHICLE IS OPERATED UNDER EXTREMELY LOW TEMPERATURES, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT CONDENSED MOISTURE FROM A POSITIVE CRANKCASE VENTILATION (PVC) PORT  MAY SEEP INTO THE BRAKE SYSTEM VACUUM PORT (\"PORT\") AND FREEZE.  THE PORT IS LOCATED INSIDE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND PROVIDES VACUUM ASSIST FOR THE BRAKES.  SHOULD THIS CONDITION CONTINUE, ICE MAY SLOWLY ACCUMULATE AT THE PORT AND IN THE WORST CASE, ULTIMATELY PLUG THE PORT.  AS A RESULT, POWER ASSIST TO THE BRAKES WOULD GRADUALLY DECREASE (EVENTUALLY TO ZERO), AND THE INCREASED PEDAL PRESSURE REQUIRED COULD LEAD TO GREATER VEHICLE STOPPING DISTANCES.\"  \"WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?\"  \"IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR YOUR VEHICLE TO BE OPERATED IN THE 19 SPECIFIED STATES OR IN THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PLEASE CONTACT ANY AUTHORIZED TOYOTA DEALER AND ....\"  THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM IS VERY SUBJECTIVE  (\"POSSIBILITY OF CONDENSED MOISTURE...\", \"ICE MAY SLOWLY ACCUMULATE...\"IF YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR YOUR VEHICLE TO BE OPERATED...\" .  I HAVE ALREADY OPERATED THE VEHICLE IN NEVADA (ONE OF THE 19 STATES LISTED).  IF THIS IS REALLY A SAFETY CONCERN I WOULD THINK THAT ALL VEHICLES SHOULD BE EITHER A) FIXED WITH THE REDESIGNED AIR INTAKE CONNECTOR OR B) PROVIDE THE VEHICLE WITH A SAFETY WARNING STICKER (PLACED PROMINENTLY ON THE STEERING WHEEL?) THAT ADVISES THE DRIVER THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN FITTED WITH THE REDESIGNED AIR INTAKE CONNECTOR AND THAT VACUUM BRAKE FAILURE MAY OCCUR WHENEVER THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW X DEGREES F (Y DEGREES C) FOR PERIODS GREATER THAN I HOURS.  WITHOUT SPECIFICS I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD RECEIVE THIS NEW PART, AND IF I ELECT NOT TO, HOW DO I PASS ON THE POSSIBLE EXTENDED LOW TEMPERATURE IMPACT TO FUTURE OWNER(S)? *TR",

AS IT WAS A WINDY DAY WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT.  IT BEHAVED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT AT HIGH SPEEDS, ON THE FREEWAY, ON A WINDY DAY.    THE PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE IS THAT IT NEEDS CONSTANT CORRECTION TO MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT PATH WHILE STEERING; CONSTANT SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP IT IN ITS LANE.  THE PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED AT HIGH SPEEDS AS SMALL ADJUSTMENTS SEEM TO BE AMPLIFIED.  AND A SMALL ADJUSTMENT TO THE RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE THE VEHICLE MEANDERS TO THE RIGHT, CREATES AN EXAGGERATED MOVEMENT TO THE RIGHT; KIND OF A DOUBLING OF THE EVENT.  SO IF YOU ARE CORRECTING MOVEMENT TO THE LEFT, BY ADJUSTING TO THE RIGHT, AND THE MECHANICAL PROBLEM KICKS IN WITH MORE RIGHT MOVEMENT, YOU GET A BIG SHIFT IN THE VEHICLE,    THE NEED TO MAINTAIN ATTENTION TO THE STEERING IS CONSTANT.  YOUR HANDS ARE ALWAYS AT THE 10 O'CLOCK, 2 O'CLOCK POSITION, AND ALWAYS MAKING CORRECTIONS TO THE FRONT END MEANDERING.

I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY WERE CERTAINLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM HOWEVER TOLD ME THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO RECALL THE ISSUE.

SHE DRIVES THE CAR ONLY LOCALLY ON SUBURBAN STREETS, AT SPEEDS LESS THAN 45 MPH, AND HAS PLACED LESS THAN 3000 MILES ON THE CAR IN 7 MONTHS.    RECENTLY WE TOOK THE CAR FOR A 'ROAD TRIP' OF ABOUT 175 MILES EACH WAY, WITH ME DRIVING.   THIS CAR DOES NOT \"STEER\" PROPERLY ON THE HIGHWAY, IF \"PROPER\" MEANS THAT IT FOLLOWS THE DRIVERS INPUT AND CONTROL MOVEMENTS.  AT LOW SPEEDS IT SEEMS THAT THE STEERING WHEEL MOVES EASILY LIKE MOST CARS WITH POWER STEERING, AND THE CAR FOLLOWS THE STEERING WHEEL MOVEMENTS FAIRLY WELL.  BUT AT SPEEDS OVER 50 MPH THE STEERING WHEEL SEEMS TO \"LOCK\" INTO A POSITION AND RESISTS BEING MOVED TO EITHER SIDE UNTIL EXCESSIVE FORCE IS APPLIED, SEVERAL POUNDS OF FORCE I WOULD SAY, THEN THE STEERING WHEEL JUMPS TO A NEW POSITION AND THE CAR TAKES OFF TO THAT SIDE, REQUIRING ANOTHER HARD PULL ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO TRY TO GO BACK TOWARD CENTER.  I HAD TO FIGHT THIS CAR FOR THREE HOURS EACH WAY ON THE HIGHWAY, AND THE SLIGHTEST INATTENTION WAS LIKELY TO RESULT IN THE CAR HEADING FOR ONE EDGE OR THE OTHER OF THE LANE, SINCE IT SEEMS TO PERIODICALLY JUST \"DRIFT\" OFF PATH FOR NO APPARENT REASON-- NO CHANGE IN ROAD SLOPE OR GEOMETRY, BUT THE CAR WOULD START MOVING TOWARD ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER. (TIRE PRESSURES WERE CHECKED BEFORE THE TRIP).    OUR FAMILY HAS OWNED 6 TOYOTAS BEFORE THIS ONE, AND NONE OF THEM HAS EVER HAD THE LACK OF RESPONSE AND \"WANDERING\" PROBLEMS OF THIS CAR.  WE STILL OWN A 1992 CELICA, WHICH IS A COROLLA IN A SPORTY BODY STYLE, AND IT \"TRACKS\" BEAUTIFULLY TO THE DRIVERS CONTROL, WITH OVER 200,000 MILES ON IT.    I THINK THAT IF A CAR HAD A STEERING SYSTEM WITH APPARENT LOOSENESS IN IT THAT WOULD DUPLICATE THE SIDE DIRECTIONS OF THIS COROLLA, WHILE THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT BEING MOVED FROM STRAIGHT AHEAD, THAT CAR WOULD NOT PASS ITS ANNUAL SAFETY TEST IN THIS STATE.  THIS CAR REQUIRES A CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO KEEP IT IN ITS LANE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. *TR",

I AM NOT SURE OF AN APPROXIMATE DATE, IT HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN AUGUST OF 2009. I WILL JUST ENTER A RANDOM DATE BELOW. *TR",

NO INJURIES TO DATE. I DO NOT FEEL TOYOTA IS MAKING REASONABLE EFFORTS TO QUICKLY ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM, ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM,  AND DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE THIS WITH STATEMENTS REGARDING MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE FOR THE DRIVE, AND SINCE THIS IN THEIR OPINION IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE FOR THEM IT IS NOT A VIABLE PROBLEM FOR THEM TO REPAIR.   2) ON APPROXIMATELY 2-11-10  I HAD TO USE MY BRAKES IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IN WHICH MY BRAKES WERE TEMPORALLY NON-RESPONSE.

TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER CONTROL, I GENTLY PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR A LITTLE THEN PRESSED GENTLY ON THE BRAKE.  WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE TO RETURN TO NORMAL SPEED, THE CAR IMMEDIATELY ACCELERATED WITHOUT MY TOUCHING THE ACCELERATOR.  I PUSHED HARD ON THE BRAKE AND STOPPED THE CAR.  THEN THE CAR RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION.      ALL THIS OCCURRED WITHIN 10 MINUTES OF LEAVING MY HOME.  AT NO TIME DID I GO MORE THAN 25MPH.  THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY.  THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 250 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.      NO, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY LETTER FROM TOYOTA ABOUT THE RECALL. AFTER THE INCIDENT, I CALLED THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN CA.  THEIR RESPONSE, OOPS I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A LETTER BUT ADMITTED NONE WAS SENT.  THEY WILL CONTACT MY DEALER.     2 OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE, IF MY HARD BRAKING DID NOT WORK THE CAR WOULD HAVE KEPT ACCELERATING, THE SURGE WAS POWERFUL.  ALSO, THE ENGINE DID NOT REV, THE CAR JUST SEEMED TO GET A SIGNAL TO ACCELERATE TO A CERTAIN SPEED.     YES, THE EXPERIENCE WAS SCARY AND DANGEROUS.  BEFORE, I WAS WILLING TO GIVE TOYOTA THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW MY GAS PEDAL WOULD GET STUCK AFTER 240 DRIVEN MILES.  PLEASE, DO YOUR JOB.  TOYOTA SHOULD PERMANENTLY TAKE BACK ANY CARE EXPERIENCING THIS ACCELERATION. THESE CARS  SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY OFF THE ROAD. *TR",

THE POWER STEERING ISSUE JUST BECAME PUBLIC THIS WEEK.    I DROVE THE CAR FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER TAKING DELIVERY TO CHECK IT OUT FOR ANY MANUFACTURING DEFECTS AND TO BREAK IT IN.  I DID NOT NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL BEHAVIORS FOR ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WHILE DRIVING AROUND TOWN DURING THIS BREAK-IN PERIOD.  HOWEVER, I DID NOTICE WHEN I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE WHILE DELIVERING THE CAR TO MY DAUGHTER THAT THE ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED POWER STEERING HAD AN UNUSUAL VAGUENESS TO IT.  THE CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS BEING BUFFETED BY HIGH WIND OR TURBULENCE FROM FOLLOWING A TRACTOR-TRAILER TOO CLOSELY, EVEN THOUGH THE WIND WAS CALM AND THERE WERE NO TRUCKS WITHIN ONE MILE OF ME.  AS I MADE VERY MINOR COURSE CORRECTIONS AS THE ROAD CURVED OR TO CHANGE LANES, IT FELT LIKE THE STEERING WAS BEING OVER-BOOSTED, WHICH CAUSED A BIGGER PATH CORRECTION THAN INTENDED OR EXPECTED.  THEN I GOT A SIMILAR REACTION IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHEN I TRIED TO CORRECT THE OVER-CORRECTION.  I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE STEERING WHEEL FELT AS IF IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE FRONT WHEELS WITH A ROPE.

OTHER UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COROLLA IS THAT WHEN I WAS DRIVING THE CAR IN UNEVEN ROADS THE BRAKE WAS GOING DOWN COMPLETELY WITH GENERATION OF SUCH ODD SOUNDS LIKE CRACKING OF TWO PIECES TOGETHER! THEREFORE I REALIZED SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH THE BRAKE. THE BRAKE BEING WEAK AND NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I CALLED TOYOTA DEALER AND TOLD THEM THE PROBLEM. ALSO, IN TRI-MONTHLY SCHEDULES FOR CHECKING THE CAR, I TOLD THEM I DO NOT LIKE THE BRAKE, IT IS NOT GOOD, NOT SHARP, SLOW TO ACTION, BUT THEY TOLD ME WE CHECKED EVERYTHING AND ALL IS FINE! NOTHING DONE TO FIX THE BRAKE FAILURE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO ANY RECORDS OF THESE CONVERSATIONS TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, JUST I HAVE A RECEIPT THAT SHOWS I BROUGHT THE CAR FOR CHECKING AND THEY CHECKED IT.

THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE WE PURCHASED THE CAR, I FIGURED IT WAS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW VEHICLE AND NEEDED DRIVEN (BROKEN IN) SO THE BRAKES WOULD FIND THEIR BEST WORKING LEVELS.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN DRIVING, AT ANY SPEED, AND IN ALL ROAD CONDITIONS.  THE INCIDENT ON 2/8 MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AND ONLY GOING ABOUT 5-8 MPH.  AS SHE MADE A TURN THE CAR PROCEEDED TO SHUTTER AND THE LOW TRACTION LIGHT AGAIN CAME ON, NO BRAKING WAS AVAILABLE DURING THIS INCIDENT, BUT LUCKILY SHE WAS ABLE TO COME TO A STOP BEFORE HITTING ANOTHER VEHICLE.  ON 2/10 I WAS GOING TO TAKE THIS CAR TO FINALLY HAVE THEM FIX THE PROBLEM AND IN (VERY SAFE) GOOD DRIVING CONDITIONS I EXPERIENCED WHAT MY WIFE HAD EXPLAINED THAT THE CAR HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE BETTER OF 6 MONTHS.  AS YOU PROCEED TO COME TO A STOP THE CAR ACCELERATES UPON DEPRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS (I HAVE TESTED THIS) IF YOU KEEP THE PEDAL AT THE SAME POINT THE CAR WILL CONTINUE TO SPEED UP SLOWLY, BUT IF YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE THE CAR SEEMS TO MAINTAIN THE SPEED.  NOW THIS IS WHERE MY WIFE WILL NOT DRIVE THE CAR ANY LONGER, WHEN YOU PRESS THE BRAKE FURTHER DOWN TO STOP IT LOCKS THE TIRES FOR ABOUT A SECOND BEFORE THE ABS EVEN KICKS IN.  BEING THAT THIS IS A COLD AREA AND WE LIKELY HAVE SNOW DURING THE WINTER MONTHS I AM AMAZED THAT IF ANY OTHER COROLLA ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM THEY ALL HAVE NOT SLID OFF THE ROAD.  WHEN I EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM ON 2/10 I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT TO TOYOTA FOR SERVICE. NEVER MADE IT, DID NOT TRUST THE VEHICLE TO SAFELY GET ME TO MY DESTINATION WITHOUT INJURY TO MYSELF, OTHERS, OR PROPERTY. THE LAST INCIDENT ON 2/15 WAS THE SAME PROBLEM, AND AT THIS POINT MY WIFE WILL NO LONGER DRIVE THE CAR.  THIS IS THE VEHICLE WE PURCHASED TO KEEP OUR NEWBORN SAFE... LOOKS TO HAVE BEEN A POOR CHOICE.  I FINALLY RISKED MY LIFE AND TOOK IT TO TOYOTA TONIGHT, WE WILL SEE WHAT COMES OF THIS. THANKS *TR",

I NOTICED THAT IT WAS FLIGHTY ON THE ROAD AND SEEMED TO WAVER WITHOUT REASON (NO WIND, NO SEMI TRUCKS, WIND SHEAR, RAIN, ETC). BEING A NEW CAR TO ME, I PASSED IT OFF AS THE NATURE OF A LIGHTER AND SMALLER VEHICLE THAN WHAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DRIVING (MY OTHER VEHICLE IS A 2004 FORD F150). SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE CONTINUALLY EXPERIENCED THIS WITH NO EXTERNAL EXPLANATION (IE: WEATHER, ROAD CONDITIONS, ETC). THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO HAPPEN AT SPEEDS OF 50 MPH AND OVER AND IT IS A CONSISTENT ISSUE. I COMMUTE REGULARLY BETWEEN STEVENSVILLE, MT., AND MISSOULA, MT., FOR WORK (28 MILES ONE WAY), AND I OFTEN FIND THAT THE CAR WILL DRIFT LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN I AM AT A STEADY SPEED. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT MY VEHICLE IS ON THE LIST OF RECALLS FOR THE RECENT ACCELERATOR ISSUE. I NEED TO ADD HERE THAT THE SECOND DAY AFTER BUYING THE CAR, I WAS GETTING FUEL AND AS I TURNED FROM THE PUMP TO RE-ENTER THE CAR, \"POP!!\" AND THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW TOTALLY SHATTERED. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALER AT BITTERROOT MOTORS AND DROVE IT TO THEIR SERVICE DEPT TO GET IT FIXED. THEY REPLACED THE WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY, AND TOLD ME THEY SUSPECTED IT WAS A PREEXISTING STRESS FRACTURE IN THE GLASS THAT FINALLY GAVE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BASED ON SAFETY RATINGS, CONSUMER REPORTS RATINGS, AND TO GET BETTER GAS MILEAGE ON MY NECESSARY TRIPS TO AND FROM WORK. IT ISN'T HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE STRESS OF THIS SITUATION, NOT TO MENTION ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. I PAID FOR THE CAR OUTRIGHT ($18,075) AND IT PHYSICALLY SICKENS ME TO THINK THAT SUCH SERIOUS ISSUES EXIST. I HAVEN'T EVEN OWNED IT 5 MONTHS! AT THIS POINT I AM FEARFUL OF EVEN DRIVING THE CAR.

THEY DID, HOWEVER, FIND A CODE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A \"CAMSHAFT TIMING\" CODE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BUT THE ORIGINAL CODE THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT TO COME ON WAS ALREADY KICKED OUT OF MEMORY.    THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THIS EVER HAPPENED.  THE DEALERSHIP RESET THE CODE FOR THE CAMSHAFT TIMING CODE BUT NOTHING ELSE WAS DONE EXCEPT RECORD IT IN MY FILE AT MY REQUEST IN CASE IT HAPPENS AGAIN.    I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM COME UP WHEN IT'S COLD AND WET.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION, THE OKLAHOMA MESONET SITE SAYS THAT THE HIGH/LOW TEMPERATURES ARE: 27JAN10 66F/43F, 28JAN10 46F/28F, AND 29JAN10 25F/19F.

THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM RELATES TO ELECTRIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM WHICH COMPROMISES STABILITY OF THE CAR DURING DRIVING. NAMELY, THE CAR DOES NOT FOLLOW ITS TRACK AND SPONTANEOUSLY STEERS LEFT OR RIGHT. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONSTANT PULLING, THE DRIVER NEEDS TO FIRMLY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL, BUT EVEN THEN, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE CAR TO KEEP IT PERFECTLY IN TRACK. THE CAR FEELS EVEN MORE UNSTABLE AND PULLS FROM SIDE TO SIDE EVEN MORE PROMINENTLY WHEN DRIVING IN FULL TRAFFIC ON HIGHWAY AT A SPEED HIGHER THAN 40 MPH, SUCH AS ATLANTA, GA, WHERE I LIVE.   I FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM WHEN TEST DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON AUGUST 10, 2009, BUT A SALES REPRESENTATIVE AT WORLD TOYOTA SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE ELECTRIC STEERING AND TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET USED TO IT. DESPITE THIS PROBLEM, I STILL DECIDED TO BUY THE CAR. BECAUSE THE CAR'S INSTABILITY ON THE ROAD DID NOT IMPROVE WITH TIME, I HAD THIS PROBLEM REVIEWED BY TOYOTA SERVICE TECHNICIANS AT THE WORLD TOYOTA DEALERSHIP DURING MY 1000 MILE MAINTENANCE CHECK ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2009 AND 5000 MILE CHECK ON JANUARY 09, 2010. DURING 1000 MILE MAINTENANCE CHECK, I WAS SUGGESTED TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL 5000 MILES TO SEE WHETHER I WOULD GET USED TO IT. DURING 5000 MILE MAINTENANCE, I WAS GIVEN TO TEST DRIVE ANOTHER TOYOTA COROLLA LE 2010 WITH A NEWER MANUFACTURE DATE AND THIS CAR WAS MORE STABLE AND HELD MUCH BETTER ON THE ROAD. TOYOTA SERVICE TECHNICIAN TESTED MY CAR AS WELL AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT. THE ALIGNMENT WAS CHECKED ON BOTH DATES, SEPTEMBER 18, 2009 AND JANUARY 09, 2010, WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CAUSES TO PULLING. AT THIS POINT, TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IS NOT DOING ANYTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. *TR",
