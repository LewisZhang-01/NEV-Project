THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND ALL OF THE BATTERY CABLES WERE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5,500 (ENERGY UNITS).  *TR.. ..UPDATED 04/24/13 *BF  THE CONSUMER STATED THE BURNING ODOR WAS PRIMARILY NOTICED WHEN TRAVELING UPHILL. FURTHER INSPECTION INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE BATTERY CABLES CONNECTING THE SIX 8-VOLT BATTERIES WERE GETTING SO HOT THAT THEY COULD NOT BE TOUCHED. THE CONSUMER TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, WHERE THEY DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TWO BAD CROSSOVER CABLES. THEY REPLACED THE TWO CABLES AND INDICATED THAT IT WAS A NORMAL MAINTENANCE ISSUE TO HAVE THE CABLES REPLACED AND THEREFORE, IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. WHEN THE CONSUMER RECEIVED HIS VEHICLE, HE NOTICED THE SAME BURNING ODOR COMING FROM SOME OF THE REMAINING CABLES. SURE ENOUGH, THE OTHER CABLE WERE GETTING EXCESSIVELY HOT AS WELL. THE DEALER AGREED TO REPLACE THE REMAINING CABLES, BUT AT THE CONSUMERS EXPENSE, EXCLUDING THE LABOR CHARGE. ...UPDATED 06-19-13 *BF",
