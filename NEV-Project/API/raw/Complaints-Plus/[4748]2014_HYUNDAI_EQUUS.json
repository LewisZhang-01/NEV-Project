        "summary": "Which vehicles this affects:  2011-2016 Hyundai Equus. All trim levels. This affects every Hyundai Equus, as all headlights are identical throughout all model years and trims.   I am the administrator for the Facebook group of this car, and am part of the automotive lighting industry. I can confirm that everyone I\u2019ve asked (several hundred people) have experienced this issue. I have owned 3 of these vehicles, all different model years, and can also confirm each vehicle had this issue.  What happened:  I came within inches of hitting a pedestrian crossing the road because the distance vision my headlights are supposed to offer has effectively been eliminated. My reaction time is now greatly reduced as I can no longer identify hazards beyond 38ft in front of my car using low beams.   Why did this happen: The reflective coating on the bowl of the HID low beam projector is incapable of handling the UV/heat emitted by the stock HID bulb, and burns off.  Complaints similar to this that resulted in recall:  This is identical to what happened with the Acura RLX LED headlights, in which they had to issue a recall.  Things I\u2019d like to add: This is not a normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d item. The reflective coating of the headlight is THE most important part of the headlight, as without it the light can not be formed into a beam whatsoever. It is not a user serviceable item, nor is it accessible for repair. The entire headlight must be replaced, and the brand new headlight has the same issue. My headlights now only provide enough light to show me things up to 38 feet away, even while being aimed properly. This is a critical failure that has no viable solution without NHTSA\u2019s intervention.  Image of the problem:  I have attached an image of the reflector bowl to show how the critical reflective coating has nearly entirely burnt off. For reference, the bowl shown in the photo SHOULD have a completely mirror finish. I have also attached their response to my report.",

        "summary": "Car is equipped with an air bag suspension system. There was a failure with the airbags around 18 months ( in 2016) of the car being put in service.  I was driving on a hway at 70 mph w/grandkids in the car when the airgbags failed and the nose of the car immediately went down and the car started to veer.  Luckily there was no other cars around me and I was able to slow down and pull off the hway. Coincidentally, I was just a mile from the dealership and immediately took the car to them and they gave me loaner car and took it in to repair under warranty. Approximately 18 months later, the air bags failed again and the car was just past warranty so I paid for the repair but contacted Hyundai and they reimbursed me.Hyundai told me they had problems with the design of the airbags and redesigned it which is what my car was then equipped with. The air bag system has failed twice more since then. The most recent incident caused many problems with the car.  The air bag system had a leak and caused the compressor to keep filling them. I don't believe this compressor was built to be in use so much and caused my battery and alternator to fail, then the compressor itself finally failed.  All this took place because of the faulty suspension air bag system. I believe Hyundai was negligent in not issuing a recall when the airbags originally failed back in 2016 as it could have led to a bad accident. I went on line and found many chat rooms with people having had the same or similar experiences to me.  Hyundai is well aware of the problems with the system yet has chosen to ignore it and hope the problem goes away.  Because of all the problems with this suspension, they have since done away with it and gone to a standard suspension system on all  the newer cars that are similar to mine ( now Genisis). They need to do something for all the older cars still on the road with this old suspension.  The date listed below is for the last incident mentioned in this document.",

WHEN THE BACK SEAT PASSENGER PUSHES THE RECLINE BUTTON ON THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER SEAT CONTROLS, THE FRONT SEAT STARTS TO COLLAPSE.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BACK OF THE SEAT MOVING IN A COLLAPSING MOTION PINNING THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER AGAINST THE DASHBOARD.  THERE SHOULD BE A SAFETY SWITCH THAT DEACTIVATES THE RECLINE CONTROL OF THE BACK SEAT WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.

THEIR NEW EQUUS:  I WANTED TO ALERT YOU ABOUT A POTENTIALLY SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAPPENED TO OCCUR WHILE MY 13 YR OLD SON & I WERE EXAMINING THE EQUUS AT THE CHARLOTTE AUTOSHOW.  I WAS SITTING IN THE DRIVER SEAT, MY SON WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT & ANOTHER COUPLE, WHO WE DID NOT KNOW, WERE IN THE BACK SEAT CHECKING OUT THE ELECTRONIC CONTROLS.  SUDDENLY, THE PASSENGER SEAT STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD & AT THE SAME TIME THE SEAT BACK BEGAN TO FOLD FORWARD.  MY SON SHOUTED OUT THAT THE SEAT WAS MOVING, BUT NEITHER HE NOR I WERE TOUCHING ANY OF THE CONTROLS.  THE COUPLE IN BACK NOTICED THIS, BUT CONTINUED TO EXAMINE/TRY THE CONTROLS ON THE REAR SEAT CENTER ARM REST.  MY SON SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, WHICH HAD NOW MOVED COMPLETELY FORWARD, WITH THE SEAT BACK STILL CONTINUING TO MOVE, COULD NOT REACH THE DOOR HANDLE TO ESCAPE.  WITHIN A FEW SECONDS HE BECAME PINNED AGAINST THE DASH BOARD & WAS CRUSHED BETWEEN THE SEAT BACK & THE DASH.  I YELLED OUT FOR EVERYONE TO STOP TOUCHING BUTTONS IMMEDIATELY, WHILE I ALSO TRIED TO MOVE THE SEAT TOWARD THE REAR USING THE BUTTONS ON THE TOP/SIDE OF THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE SEAT STOPPED MOVING FORWARD & I WAS THEN ABLE TO MOVE IT REARWARD, FREEING MY SON.  HE WAS GASPING FOR AIR AT THE POINT & ANOTHER AUTO SHOW ATTENDEE OPENED THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE, ALLOWING MY SON TO ESCAPE.  I CALLED ONE OF THE HYUNDAI SHOW REPS OVER TO THE CAR TO POINT OUT THIS SAFETY ISSUE & HE TOOK NOTE.  THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE REAR SEAT COUPLE WAS TRYING TO ADJUST THEIR SEATS, BUT THEY WERE UNKNOWINGLY USING THE CONTROL THAT MOVES THE PASSENGER SEAT FORWARD FOR MORE REAR LEG ROOM.  THERE APPEARS TO BE NO SAFETY SENSOR THAT PREVENTS THIS.  THERE SHOULD BE A SAFETY SWITCH, USING THE FRONT PASSENGER WEIGHT TO DEACTIVATE THE REAR SEAT CONTROLS FOR THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.",
