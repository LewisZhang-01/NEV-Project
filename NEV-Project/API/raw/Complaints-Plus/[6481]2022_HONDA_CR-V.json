Defrosting on cold days becomes an issue which creates a potential hazard for visibility. The red bar on the temperature guage will not appear when idling and the temperature rises and the red bar appears only after the car has been driven. Searching online on this issue indicates this is an issue where many CRV owners have had this weak heating system issue. I contacted the dealer and they said \"Yes we are aware of that. And that's the way it is and nothing can be done about it.\" So there appears to be no intent by Honda to address this weak heating system issue which is a big problem in winter weather. Thus my filing this complaint. Honda should perform a recall and correct this problem.",
