FOR THE NEXT 2-3 MONTHS THE TRUCK WOULD START SOMETIMES AND RUN FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND SHUT OFF AND OTHER TIMES IT WOULD JUST TURN OVER AS IF IT HAD A BAD ALTERNATOR.THE STRANGE THING IS WHEN IT WAS 70-74 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND BELOW THE TRUCK WOULD START AND RUN FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEFORE SHUTTING OFF AND WHEN YOU TRIED TO START THE ENGINE RIGHT AFTER IT WOULD JUST TURN OVER AND NOT START.  IF IT WAS CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES OR HOTTER OUTSIDE, THE TRUCK WOULD NEVER START, IT WOULD JUST TURN OVER LIKE A BAD ALTERNATOR. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE \"NO BUS\" CODE, I FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS AN INDICATION THAT THE POWER CONTROL MODULE (PCM/ECM COMPUTER) WAS BAD.

IT HAS BEEN SERVICED AT RECOMMENDED AND REQUIRED INTERVALS AT MANAHAWKIN DODGE APPROXIMATELY EVERY 3,000 MILES. EARLY INTO MY OWNERSHIP I HAD INTERMITTENT TROUBLE WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER AND THEY TRIED TO ASSESS THE PROBLEM. THEY DID A RECHARGE OF THE SYSTEM AND CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD AT 28998 MILES THAT THE \"PULSING\" WHEN MY BRAKES WERE APPLIED WAS DUE TO \"HOT SPOTS\" ON MY FRONT ROTORS.  WHEN I INQUIRED AS TO HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN TO A RELATIVELY NEW TRUCK THAT IS USED AS A PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE I WAS TOLD THEY REALLY \"DID NOT KNOW BUT HAVE HAD TO REPLACE OTHERS.\" IT IS NOTED THAT I NEVER HAD TO REPLACE ROTORS ON MY PREVIOUS NISSANS. THAT ENDED UP COSTING ME $393.

THIS I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOME DODGE VEHICLES AND I HAVE SINCE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DAIMLERCHRYSLER REGARDING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE PART.

TODAY I NOTICED THE PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD WAS SOAKED WITH WATER.  I THOUGHT THAT MY HEATER CORE WAS BUSTED BUT THE FLUID WASN'T ANTIFREEZE IT WAS WATER.  I PULLED THE CARPET BACK AND TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS 2 GALLONS OF WATER ON THE FLOOR BOARD UNDER THE CARPET.  MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 41000 MILES AND I THOUGHT THIS TO BE STRANGE AT SUCH AN EARLY TIME OF THE VEHICLE.  I DECIDED TO LOOK ON THE INTERNET AND TYPED THE WORDS \" DODGE DAKOTA PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD WET\" AT MY YAHOO SEARCH ENGINE.  I WAS AMAZED WHEN AT LEAST 50 MESSAGE BOARDS WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ASKING THE SAME QUESTION AND PEOPLE REPLYING TO THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE A LOT OF UPSET DODGE DAKOTA OWNERS THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT APPEARS IN THE MESSAGE BOARDS THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING CONDENSATION VENT TUBE CAUSING THIS PROBLEM IN MANY DAKOTAS.  I HAVE NOT CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP YET BUT INTEND TO.  I BELIEVE THERE TO ALSO BE A HEALTH CONCERN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS APPARENT DEFECT.  I HAVE NOTICED AN ODOR IN THE VEHICLE IN THE PAST AND IT WAS APPARENT WHEN I PULLED THE CARPET UP TODAY WHAT IT IS.  THERE IS MILDEW AND MOLD ALL OVER THE FLOORBOARD OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO THIS CONDITION/WATER DEFECT.  PLEASE GIVE THIS MATTER THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
