Car would slow when brake applied but immediately accelerated and kept increasing (speed was well over 90 mph & climbing ) when brake was released .

I didn\u2019t realize how serious the incident could be. I called dealership but first available service appointment (scheduled) is Feb. 23,2022",

Back up cameras were made mandatory safety equipment requirements for all new cars manufactured after 2018 due to safety concerns. The federal government mandated the cameras  to prevent \u201cback over\u201d accidents of young children who are not otherwise visible to the driver. There have been multiple attempts to repair the cameras on this vehicle, including replacing all cameras, replacing all wiring harnesses/pigtails, replacing the coax cable for the cameras as well as module/software updates. The vehicle has been at the authorized service center multiple times with it being there 105 out of the past 112 days; the vehicle was \"fixed\" for 4 days before the back up camera failed again. The manufacture has been unable to repair the vehicle to have reliable working cameras. We have spoken with others about the same failure of the back up camera system.",
