In the past year I have become the primary driver of the fusion. At first nothing seemed to be wrong, a simple check engine light. I immediately went to the local AutoZone and used the code checker to see what the light was signaling. The code stated a misfire in cylinder 2, so we took it to Shealy's auto in Cayce for a deeper look and spark plug replacement. After Mr. Shealy and his team replaced the coil, and the spark plugs all was fine for a few days. We received the car back and two days later the check engine light returned. This prompted a swift return to Mr. Shealy where he re-checked the code and lightly examined the state of the engine. Mr. Shealy turned the vehicle into the on position and ran the code checker, after receiving the same misfire as before he opened the hood and partially removed the plastic cover over the engine. After confirming his technicians had replaced the proper coil, and all spark plugs, Mr. Shealy cleared the code and sent me on my way. 3 days later the car began running slightly warm, then violently throwing the code, overheat wildly, turning off electronic to reduce engine heat, and rethrowing the cylinder misfire when examined by the mechanic.",

Ford knows rhis is an issue, every mechanic i have spoke to knows this is an issue, theres service bulletins but no recall on the 2.0l ecoboost, just the 1.5.. why? Im told recalls dont hit til over a million people are affected or complain? how messed up is that?? meanwhile people like me who have not had the car long either pay or are out a car.

The following Monday morning, my car would start to vibrate when at a stop sign or traffic light when in drive. Over the following couple days, the vibration became excessive to the point that the car would vibrate excessively and stall if left in Drive when at a stop. When one is at a stop and puts the car into Park, the engine RPM's immediately surge and then settle down to a normal RPM. There were no warning lamps or messages on the dash. I took the car to my local Meineke on Friday of the same week and they determined that it was a Torque Converter issue and that is something that they could not do. I then took the car to my the nearest Ford Dealership in which they confirmed that the Torque Converter was indeed the issue. They said that they did get Warnings from their obd reader but there are still no warning lamps on the dash. The Ford Dealership filed a claim with Ford as a Torque Converter and/or Transmission are a known issue at this time. My car is the same model year, made at the same factory in the same assembly time as a known recall. My issue is similar to Recall no. 17V427000, but not exactly the same yet. Reference: https://auto-recalls.justia.com/ford/fusion/2017/17v427000/     I drove the following few days while waiting for Ford's approval to proceed with the repair/replacement but now feel the car sporadically surge at highway speeds and it's getting more noticeable over time. Ford declined my car for a recall. If one Googles the same model and issue, there are a LOT of people with the same issue around the same mileage. I'm continuing to hesitantly drive as I need to get to/from work. I'm proceeding with getting the Torque Converter/Transmission replaced via the Ford Dealership at at a cost of ~ $5k as I have no other options at this time.",

THE ROAD IS SUCH THAT PEOPLE HAD TO DRIVE THROUGH NEIGHBORS' YARDS TO GET AROUND ME. I'M VERY FORTUNATE THAT MY NEIGHBOR IS AN ENGINE MECHANIC AND WAS ABLE TO WALK OVER AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. HE TOLD ME THE SHIFT LINKAGE WAS NOT CONNECTED AND THAT THE BUSHING THAT HOLDS IT ON APPEARED TO BE MISSING. IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIM I MAY STILL BE SITTING IN THE ROAD. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL OF THIS EXACT SAME PART FOR FORD FUSION MODEL YEARS 2013-2016. HOWEVER, MINE IS A 2017 THAT CAME OUT OF THE PLANT IN APRIL OF 2016. THEREFORE, IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE DESIGN OF THIS SHIFTER CABLE BUSHING DID NOT DRASTICALLY CHANGE BETWEEN THE MAKING OF MY VEHICLE IN APRIL OF 2016 AND A 2016 MODEL THAT WAS MADE JUST A MONTH OR SO EARLIER WHICH WAS ELIGIBLE FOR A RECALL. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE A YOUNG CHILD AND MY DRIVEWAY IS ON AN INCLINE. THE COMPLAINTS THAT I'VE RESEARCHED SAID THAT WITH THIS ISSUE THE CAR COULD BE STUCK IN NEUTRAL WHEN YOU THINK IT IS IN PARK FOR EXAMPLE, AND MY CHILD COULD HAVE BEEN IN THEIR CAR SEAT WHILE THE VEHICLE ROLLED AWAY. THIS IS NOT OK! FORD SAID MY 2017 FUSION WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL AND CHARGED $6 FOR THE BUSHING AND $60 TO INSTALL A PART THAT'S BEEN A RECALL ISSUE ON OTHER MODELS. MY CONCERN IS THE SAFETY OF OTHERS AND THE FACT THAT MY VEHICLE IS SURELY ONE OF THE EARLIER 2017 MODELS MANUFACTURED WITH THE SAME EXACT ISSUE AS A RECALLED MODEL WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MADE JUST A MONTH OR TWO PRIOR. I DO HOPE THAT IT'S LOOKED INTO FOR THE 2017 FORD FUSION MODELS TO BE ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST FOR THE SHIFTER CABLE BUSHING RECALL.",

I TOOK THE CAR TO BRANFORD FORD IN BRANFORD CT.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AND TOLD ME THERE IS COOLANT LEAKING INTO CYLINDER NUMBER 1 AND THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE ISSUE IS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.  MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE COST TO REPLACE IS $5700.00!!  THIS A 2 1/2 YEAR OLD CAR THAT NEEDS AND ENGINE REPLACEMENT?!? I DID A TON OF RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS JUST LIKE THIS, SOME IN WARRANTY AND SOME NOT. FORD DID HAVE A RECALL ON THE 1.5 LITER ENGINE FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  APPARENTLY THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL OR WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR THIS PROBLEM, SO BASICALLY I AM BEING TOLD I AM STUCK WITH THE BILL.  I AM LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE FROM FORD TO REPLACE THIS ENGINE AT NO COST TO ME AS THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AMONG THE CONSUMERS BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN \"ENOUGH\" DOCUMENTATION TO WARRANT ACTION BY THE MANUFACTURER.

SINCE SYNC IS TIED INTO 911 SYSTEM FOR CRASHES, THIS WILL PREVENT OCCUPANTS FROM ENGAGING WITH 911 OPERATORS HANDS-FREE IN AN ACCIDENT.  IF OCCUPANTS CANNOT REACH/MANIPULATE PHONE IN A CRASH, THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO CALL FOR HELP.    ISSUE 3:  INTERMITTENT REAR CAMERA FAILURE.  AFTER RAINFALL AND FROST EVENTS, THE REAR CAMERA DOES NOT ENGAGE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PLACED IN REVERSE GEAR.  THE SCREEN IS BLACK, EXCEPT FOR AN OUTLINE OF THE VEHICLE.  THE RADAR SENSORS REMAIN ACTIVE AND BEEPS IF THE VEHICLE IS CLOSE TO BACKING INTO AN OBJECT.  AFTER A PERIOD OF DRYNESS, THE CAMERA RE-ENGAGES.  I ASSUME THERE IS A MOISTURE INTRUSION PROBLEM, BUT AM UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE ENTRY POINT.  ONLINE SEARCHES SUGGEST THAT MOISTURE MAY BE INTRUDING THROUGH THE FACTORY-INSTALLED, ROOF-MOUNTED ANTENNA.",
