THE VEHICLE LOST POWER AND COULD NOT BE MOVED UNDER IT'S OWN POWER. WHEN I STARTED CHECKING ONLINE, I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM.  I AM CERTAINLY NO SAFETY EXPERT, BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT HAVING A COMPONENT BURN UP IN THE DASH, SIZZLING AND SMOKING THAT CAUSES A SUDDEN LOSS OF ELECTRICAL AND DRIVE POWER WOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE.  AGAIN, THIS IS EXTREMELY COMMON FOR THE FORD THINK AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL SOMEONE GETS HURT.  I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A NEW REVISED CLUSTER FROM FORD, BUT IT TOO HAS THE VERY SAME PROBLEM. *TR",
