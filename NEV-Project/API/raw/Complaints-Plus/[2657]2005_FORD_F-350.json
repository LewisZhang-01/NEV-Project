They specifically performed work on the electrical wiring and truck keeps blowing fuses. They performed work on the transmission and the transmission failed shortly after. They performed work on the engine and deleted illegally all the emissions EGR pollutant controls. They installed faulty wiring for the electric trailer brake controls and the electronic speed controls. They tampered with the air conditioning system causing the compressor to blow out, send metal through the a/c lines, and the belt stopped turning causing the serpentine belt to break, tear the fan shroud apart and shred. They also installed a trailer brake controller that was aftermarket and it caused brake loss and intermittent failure with the service brake system and speed control. Domingo also tuned the computer to make the truck output 550 horsepower which caused the new engine to fail prematurely and the transmission to fail as well.

IT DOESN'T GO AWAY ON IT'S OWN YOU HAVE TO COME TO A STOP OR GET TO ABOUT FIVE MILES AN HOUR FOR IT TO RESET. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. I HAVE HAD THE LOCAL FRONT END SHOP REPLACE THE FRONT STEERING COMPONENTS, EVEN THOUGH THE COMPONENTS CAME WITH IN SPEC THAT FORD SAYS IS SAFE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION NEEDS BE TAKEN. THIS HELPED FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS BUT NOW I'M BACK TO THE SAME OLD PROBLEM. FORD SAYS TO TAKE IT TO A FORD AUTHORIZED DEALER AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT OUT. I'LL DO IT ONE MORE TIME, THIS IS REPETITIVE, THEY DON'T SEE A PROBLEM IN THEIR PRODUCT SO WHY AM I WASTING MY TIME. EVERYBODY SAYS ITS YOUR TIRE PRESSURE, WRONG, I RUN IT AT MAX AND I'VE EVEN TRIED RUNNING IT  FIVE POUNDS HIGHER THAN RECOMMENDED. WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP US AND GET THIS FIXED RIGHT. I KNOW FORD WONT EVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM FOR THE CHANCE OF A LAWSUIT. SO I GUESS IT'S UP TO THE HIGHWAY SAFETY COUNCIL TO HELP. I'LL GIVE ALL OF YOU A RIDE AND SHOW YOU HOW BAD IT IS. AND THEN I CAN GIVE YOU ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOWING FORD SAYS THE FRONT END ARE WITHIN SPEC. YOU KNOW ITS BAD WHEN IT SHIMMIES YOU OFF THE ROAD, THIS IS AS BEST YOU CAN DO TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.  *TR",

FROM THE BEGINNING, THE TRUCK EXPERIENCED SEVERE FRONT-END VIBRATION WHEN I REACHED ABOUT 60 MPH.  IT CONTINUED UNTIL I GOT TO ABOUT 80 MPH.  I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FROM THE FIRST VISIT FOR SERVICE AT DOWNEY FORD.  AFTER A FEW VISITS FOR DIAGNOSTICS, DOWNEY FORD INSTALLED A \"DAMPENER\" ON THE FRONT END.  IT MADE THE PROBLEM BETTER, BUT IT DID NOT COMPLETELY CURE THE DEFECT.    I EVENTUALLY BOUGHT A LANCE CAMPER, WHICH WAS ON THE TRUCK FOR OVER A YEAR.  WHILE THE TRUCK HAD THE 3000 LB CAMPER ON IT, THE VIBRATION WENT AWAY ON THE STRAIGHTAWAY, BUT WAS HORRIBLY DANGEROUS ON THE CURVES.  FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SUCH CURVE IS THE 605 SB TO THE 405 SB IN LONG BEACH.  I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE/CAMPER ON THIS CURVE UNLESS I ALMOST STOPPED.    I REMOVED THE CAMPER ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRUCK IS WORSE.  IT NOW WILL VIBRATE UNCONTROLLABLY AT 40-50 MPH.     I REPORTED THIS VIBRATION PROBLEM EVERY TIME I WENT TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE.  THEY ALWAYS SAID THEY DID ALL THEY COULD WITH THE DAMPENER.    I TOOK THE TRUCK TO EL CAJON FORD ABOUT 3-4 WEEKS AGO.  NOW THAT IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY, FORD NOW SAYS IT CAN FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT IT HAS DAMAGE THE FRONT STEERING MECHANISM.  THE SERVICE WRITER SAID IN A VOICE MAIL THAT DOWNEY PUT ON A DAMPER THAT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY TRUCK.    I DEMANDED THEY FIX IT FREE AND THEY REFUSE.    I WANT MY TRUCK FIXED.  THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT, SINCE IT HAS EXISTED FROM DAY 1.  I HAVE READ ON SEVERAL WEBSITES THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT EXISTED WELL BEFORE 2005, BUT FORD HAS IGNORED THE SAFETY ISSUES.

TO FIND OUT FROM THE DEALER THAT THE FUEL TANK IS DELAMINATING WHICH CAUSE DEBRIS TO GET INTO THE FUEL PUMP AND INJECTORS CAUSING IT TO STALL.  FORD HAS KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THEY CHANGE THERE FUEL TANK DESIGN BUT DID NOT INFORM ANY OWNERS OF THIS SAFETY DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE KILLED ME. NOW I AM ALSO LOOKING AT A $3000. REPAIR BILL THAT FORD WILL NOT BACK ME ON. TO REPLACE THE FUEL TANK WITH A NEW SAFE ONE. I AM ALSO LOOKING AT MY OTHER TWO TRUCKS AND WONDER IF THEY ARE SAFE TO DRIVE. I HOPE THAT NO ONE WILL GET KILLED DUE TO THIS LACK OF PUBLIC INFORMATION BY FORD.  *TR",
