THIS IS DUE TO THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM UNDER THE DASH.  I HAVE NEARLY BEEN IN 8 WRECKS DUE TO THE PROBLEM.   I DO KNOW UPON READING THAT MAXIMAS HAVE  PROBLEM ELECTRICALLY UNDER THE DASH AND SOME OTHER NISSAN THAT MY FRIENDS HAVE OWNED.  PERTAINING TO THE SECOND ISSUE.  IT IS NOT THE LUGGAGE RACK BUT THE SPOILER (IT WAS THE CLOSEST THING ON THE LIST TO DESCRIBE.)  I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM AND UPON OBERSERVATION OF OTHER MAXIMAS IT IS NOT JUST MINE.  I BELIEVE DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW A PROBLEM WITH THE SPOILER IS THIS.  ON THE OUTER EGDES OF THE SPOILER ON MINE AND OTHERS WHERE THE SPOILER IS ATTACHED TO THE TRUNK LID WATER GETS UP UNDER THE EGDES AND CAUSES RUST AND RELEASE OF THE OUTER EDGES OF THE SPOILER AND THEY COM LOOSE AS DID MINE.  ALL THAT IS LEFT IS 4, 8MM NUTS TO HOLD THE SPOILER. LUCKLY MINE HELD LONG ENOUGH KEEP MINE ON FOR ME TO STOP.  IF NOT MY SPOILER COULD HAVE COME OFF AND TO THE BEHIND TRAFFIC CAUSE A SEVER ACCIDENT OF THE INTERSTATE.  I HAVE LOOKED INTO REPLACING BUT THE COST OF THE SPOILER IS 800.00.   I HAVE REATTACHED BUT THE SPOILER IS COMING LOOSE AGAIN.  THANK YOU",
