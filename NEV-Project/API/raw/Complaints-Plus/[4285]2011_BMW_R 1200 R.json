ALL RUN BY A \"FUEL STRIP\" INSIDE THE GAS TANK.  ON THIS DATE I RAN OUT OF FUEL ON A BUSY INTERSTATE WITH 1) NO LOW FUEL LIGHT. 2) ABOUT HALF A TANK SHOWING ON THE GRAPHIC DISPLAY 3) \"159 MILES TO EMPTY\" ON THE COMPUTER.  ALL THESE ITEMS ARE DRIVEN BY THIS FAULTY FUEL STRIP.    IT IS QUITE A SAFETY ISSUE TO HAVE YOU ENGINE HALT SUDDENLY AT SPEED ON A BUSY URBAN INTERSTATE.  I WAS STRANDED AGAINST THE INNER GUARD RAIL FOR SOMETIME AS 70MPH TRAFFIC RAN BUY ABOUT 4 FEET AWAY.  MANY OF THESE FUEL STRIPS HAVE FAILED IN BMW MOTORCYCLES AND THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED BY AN IMPROVED PART.  *TR",
