THIS MAKES IT UNSAFE FOR EXIT FROM THE VEHICLE FOR ANY PERSONS SITTING IN THE BACK OR REAR SEATS. GM KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM. THERE ARE 4 SERVICE BULLETINS FOR THIS PROBLEM. DATED- SEPT. 24, 2001, MAY 01, 2002, JUNE 1, 2003, AND OCT 1, 2006... THE COST TO REPAIR THESE DOOR HINGES IS OUTRAGEOUS.. THEY ARE GM ONLY PARTS, AND TO REPLACE ALL 8 HINGES (THERE ARE 2 HINGES, BODY & DOOR, THAT MAKE UP 1 FULL HINGE. SO A TOTAL OF 8 ARE NEEDED TO REPLACE ALL) COST MINIMUM 115.00 A PIECE (SOME ARE MORE). THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO REPLACE THE PINS AND BUSHINGS TO MAKE THE HINGES MOVE PROPERLY. THESE ARE 83.00 FOR JUST 2 PINS. SO TO DO ALL 4 HINGES YOU NEED 2 SETS.  FOR A TOTAL TO COMPLETELY REPLACE ALL HINGES W/PINS AND BUSHINGS-- 1,036.00  JUST TO USE 2 DOORS ON YOUR VEHICLE.  AND THAT ISN'T LABOR..  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.!!!!!!!  THEY KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM, AND THEY ARE KEEPING THE REPLACEMENTS TO THEMSELVES...  MEANWHILE, I HAVE 2 DOORS ON MY VAN, THAT WON'T OPEN, SO IF I DO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, MY CHILDREN WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THANKS GM..  *TR",
