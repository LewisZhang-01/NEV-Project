WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD BUT THE BIKE LURCHED AND WOULD NOT GET INTO GEAR.  THIS CAUSED ME TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION WITH TRAFFIC AROUND ME.  I WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO GET THE BIKE MOVING, BUT IT WAS VERY SLOW AND WOULD NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY INTO GEAR.    I HAVE HEARD OF NUMEROUS SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH OTHERS OWNERS OF THE SAME BIKE. *TR",
