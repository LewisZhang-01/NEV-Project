I GOT OUT OF MY VEHICLE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND DISCOVERED THAT MY LEFT FRONT WHEEL WELL HAD RUSTED THROUGH AND HAD ROTATED UP AND INTO MY STEERING COLUMN BREAKING THE SPRING IN THE COLUMN AND KNOCKING OUT MY STEERING.  SO FAR NISSAN AND MY DEALER HAVE DONE NOTHING.  THEY HAVE REJECTED MY CLAIM THAT THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN ME A FORMAL ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO REPAIR.  THEY DID OFFER ME $500 OF TRADE IN VALUE TOWARDS A NEW VEHICLE PURCHASE.  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2009 I REQUESTED THAT THE VEHICLE BE REPAIRED AT MY COST.  I VISITED THE DEALER ON DECEMBER 1, 2009 TO CHECK ON PROGRESS, AND AS OF THIS AFTERNOON DECEMBER 4, 2009 THEY HAVE NOT PREPARED AN ESTIMATE.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL BRACKET WOULD PREVENT THE WHEEL WELL FROM HITTING THE STEERING COLUMN.  I AM LUCKY THAT IT HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY LATER THAT DAY WAS GOING TO DRIVE THAT VEHICLE TO NEW YORK STATE WHERE IF THIS HAPPENED AT HIGH SPEED WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS AND POSSIBLE FATAL CRASH.

MY 6CD BOSE CHANGER ALSO SHUT DOWN ON ME IN 2007 JUST STOP WORKING AND NOT EJECTING CDS AND DOING A  CLICK CLICK NOISE ALL THE TIME I HAVE TWO CDS IN THERE I CAN NOT REMOVE OR GET OUT. ACCORDING TO NISSAN THEY DON'T HANDLE THESE ISSUES AND DO NOT FIX THEM THEY REPLACE THE WHOLE CD CHANGER FOR $700-$800. THIS IS A CONTINUOUS PROBLEM AND ISSUE WITH THEM AND THEIR SISTER COMPANIES WITH THE BOSE SYSTEM THE VEHICLES ARE PROVIDED WITH WHEN YOU PURCHASE THEM. YOU DO NOT ORDER THE SYSTEM IT COMES WITH THE VEHICLE BUT THEY WONT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY NOR FIX IT. I ALSO HAD THE ENGINE LIGHT PROBLEM AND TOOK TO A MECHANIC WHOM STATED WAS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER CODE ON THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND HAD TO TAKE TO NISSAN BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT TOUCH THE VEHICLE AND WAS STILL UNDER MANUFACTURER WARRANTY BEING UNDER 80,000. QUOTE PER NISSAN ALL IT WAS IS AN ELECTRICAL COMPUTER UPGRADE CODE. NEEDED TO UPGRADE MY ELECTRICAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE?????? THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON THEN WENT OFF WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THEN CAME BACK ON AND STAYED ON AND NEVER SHUT OFF UNTIL NISSAN REPROGRAMMED THE SYSTEM. I ALSO HAD MY MUFFLER FALL COMPLETELY OFF FROM THE BACK END UP UNTIL THE MIDDLE PART. WAS TOTALLY RUSTED AND CAME RIGHT OFF AND OF COURSE IT FELL OFF RIGHT AFTER NISSAN PASSED ME FOR MY INSPECTION W/ EMISSIONS  30 DAYS PRIOR??? I SEE ALL THESE COMPLAINTS AND FOR YEARS AND NOTHING BEING DONE NOR ARE THEY TAKING CARE OF ANYTHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY REPETITIOUS ON THE SITE ALL THE SAME COMMON COMPLAINTS BUT YET NISSAN NOT DOING ANYTHING NOR THIS SITE TO HELP US CONSUMERS AND HAVE NISSAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THIS. *TR",
