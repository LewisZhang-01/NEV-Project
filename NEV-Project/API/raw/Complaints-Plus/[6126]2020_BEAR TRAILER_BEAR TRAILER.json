THE AXLE OF THE TRAILER CAME LOOSE AND PASSENGER SIDE SLID A FOOT BACKWARD CAUSING THE DRIVER SIDE TIRE TO BLOW OUT AND SHREDDING THE INSIDE OF THE PASSENGER SIDE TIRE WHILE THROWING RUBBER ALL OVER THE BOAT. WE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY SO THE TRAILER WOULD NOT FLIP OVER AND POSSIBLY CAUSING THE TRUCK TO FLIP OVER AS WELL.  IT APPEARED THAT THE NUTS FOR THE U-BOLTS VIBRATED LOOSE CAUSING THE AXLE TO SLIDE BACKWARD. I ALSO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT ANOTHER CUSTOMER HAD A TRAILER ISSUE ON THE VERY DAY (06/1/2020) WE BOUGHT OUR BOAT. THE DEALER GAVE THEM A NEW TRAILER THAT DAY BECAUSE THE OTHER TRAILER WAS UNUSABLE. I HAVE 15 PICTURES BUT ONLY ABLE TO LOAD 5.*DT*JB*DT*DT  CONSUMER STATED DEALER REPLACED THE TRAILER WITH A USED UPGRADED TRAILER AND SAME VIN WAS USED.*JB*JB",
