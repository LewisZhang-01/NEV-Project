        "summary": "WHEN I RUN THIS TRUCK OFF OF THE REAR FUEL TANK/PUMP, IT PUMPS GAS INTO THE FRONT TANK. THE FRONT TANK THEN RAPIDLY FILLS AND OVERFLOWS OUT OF THE FILLER SPOUT. FOUND THAT FORD HAS ISSUED A RECALL (93S68) FOR THIS PROBLEM IN 1993 FOR ALL 1990-1993 GASOLINE-POWERED TRUCKS. CHECKED MY ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS RECALL WITH LOCAL DEALER AND WAS TOLD MY TRUCK WAS INELIGIBLE. THEY SAID THE RECALL/REPAIR HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE ON THIS VEHICLE, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE RECALL/REPAIR IN-LINE CHECK VALVES ON MY TRUCK. I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SIMPLY CLOSED THE BOOKS ON THIS PROBLEM/RECALL. OTHER TRUCK OWNERS I HAVE TALKED TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM...THEY EITHER GET THE SAME NO ANSWER FROM THE DEALER WHEN CHECKING ON THE RECALL, OR THE DEALER TELLS THEM THE RECALL/REPAIR IS ONLY WARRANTIED FOR 12 MONTHS/12,000 MILES. FORD'S RECALL/REPAIR SOLUTION DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THESE TRUCKS ARE STILL A DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD WHEN THE IN-TANK FUEL PUMP CHECK VALVES FAIL. GAS FROM ONE TANK OVERFILLS AND SPILLS OUT OF THE SECOND TANK, CREATING A MAJOR FIRE HAZARD. MUST SOMEONE DIE BEFORE FORD TAKES RESPONSIBILITY IN CORRECTING THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT IN ENGINEERING??? *AK",
