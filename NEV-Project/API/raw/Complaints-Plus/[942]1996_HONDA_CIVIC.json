THE FIRST VISIT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CHARGED ME $89.00 TO RUN A \"DIAGNOSTIC\".  I WAS TOLD THE SRS WAS \"RETOOLED\" AND THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE OKAY.  TWO DAYS LATER THE SRS LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  SERVICE PERSONNEL TOLD ME I NEEDED TO BRING THE CAR IN AGAIN SOON.  THERE WAS NO CHARGE, BUT I WAS TOLD IF THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, THE MODULE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST IS USUALLY $460.00, I WAS TOLD.  ALSO I'D NEED TO CALL AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT IN ADVANCE SINCE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT STOCK THE MODULE- IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED.  WHEN I ASKED IF THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE, SERVICE PERSONNEL ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.  TWO DAYS LATER THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  THAT WAS LAST WEEKEND.  I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE.  AN INTERNET SEARCH I PERFORMED HAS TURNED UP QUITE A FEW CONSUMERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AS WELL AS SIMILAR RUN-AROUNDS FROM DEALERS: HTTP://WWW.AUTOFAN.COM/FORUM_THREAD.ASP?MESSAGE=7364  WILL THE AIRBAGS WORK ON IMPACT?  IF I HAVE THE MODULE REPLACED, WILL THE SYSTEM WORK?  THESE ARE MY CONCERNS.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HONDA IS NOT BEING REQUIRED TO ADDRESS AND REMEDY THIS SAFETY ISSUE.   *AK",
