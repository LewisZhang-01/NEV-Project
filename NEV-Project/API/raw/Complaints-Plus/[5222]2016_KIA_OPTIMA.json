I took it to the dealership and they put me on an oil consumption check every 1000 miles.  After 3 rounds of checks they determined it was an issue with the GDI fuel system needing to be flushed which was performed by the dealership service department.  The engine appeared to no longer consume excessive oil after I checked at about 1000 miles.  After approximately 2000 miles, before my wife left for a long trip, I checked oil and it was down 1 quart.  I topped off the oil and after about 750 miles, I checked the oil level and it was about 1 quart low again.  The car is currently at the dealership and I'm told I will have to start the whole 1000 mile consumption check AGAIN!  Based on other reports of engine seizing and fires I consider this a very possible hazard.",

I would be around 3 quarts of oil low every 2,000 miles. I have taken my vehicle to the KIA dealership and started the process of a oil consumption test to build a case. After some maintenance work and coming due to check back with the dealer for the 3rd engine oil test, the engine light illuminated. I checked my oil level to make sure there was oil in there and after restarting my car the light turned off. 4 days later my car stalled when coming to a stop. After a few minutes I was able to power my car back on and drive it safely home. The car was taken to the Dealership I have been going to in San Bernardino. I let them know I had checked the oil dipstick after the engine light was on before the stall and they told me I would have to start the engine consumption test over for taking out the dipstick, altering the test. My car has been at the dealership for 4 days with no word on why my engine stalled but I can pick up my car today after they do an oil change to begin the oil consumption test again. They asked that I drive 1,000 miles and bring it back for a final check on the oil per KIA's instruction. In the meantime I have to hope that my car will not stall again possibly causing a wreck harming myself and others or that my engine will not fail before the 1,000 miles are up. If I make it to 1,000 I am hoping KIA will honor the powertrain warranty and fix the engine, but my hope is fading.

One week later the rear window on the driver side failed in the same manner.  Motor can be heard running and window drops down on it's own. My first fear was I was ripped off and dealer only switched the two parts because what are the chances? Having just spent $700 I did not return immediately but within 2-weeks, before making the appointment the passenger front window breaks!  So at that point I start thinking a there must be a recall and start checking. I don't learn the cause of the issue until last month, Sept when the final window gave up as well.  Not having the driver door window in FL where I drive on bridges is a hazard.  I learned that a \"plastic on plastic gear mechanism\" fails over time.  I am single and rarely have anyone in the rear seats so those gears crumbled from lack of use!  KIA changed the design in 2018 due to failures but is failing to take care of earlier models costing owners thousands in repairs. I am the original owner, the car was 5-years old Feb 2021 and the car is garaged at work and home. These should be recalled no one should have to pay thousands in repairs when clearly this is defective and dangerous.  All of the windows broke while the car was driving down the road.  I live in Florida and this happened during storm season.  Very luckily for the interior it wasn't raining as the windows were in the down position when they would not return to closed.  I drive over Tampa Bay every day for work so not having working windows is dangerous.  Someone should hold KIA accountable they know they are defective.  I heard from a Hyundai owner they have the same problem, no surprise KIA owns Hyundai!  I bet they changed that design too! My car is garaged work & home so likely helped mine from crumbling under warranty. Please recall window regulators!",

We were driving late at night back from a work trip when al of a sudden the check engine light came on and the motor started to shake and a thudding noise was getting louder. We were able to pull over and saw that there was literally no oil in the car. No warning nothing. Again we had just had an oil change not even 30 days prior. My father had to come tow us home an hour and a half away because he was worried with the sounds it was making that it might blow. There was smoke coming from the exhaust and the motor was shaking like it had no control. I\u2019ve read multiple issues just like this one and of course my car just passed warranty. I\u2019m not even done paying the car off. This should be an issue Kia has to fix by now with so many similar complaints. It\u2019s dangerous and fraud.

Car performed ok until 9/22/21, again the car started to shake violently (bucking), loud knocking sound, engine light came on, went into limp mode, was pulled over immediately, dealership contacted, car driven directly there (3 miles). Notified at 4:30pm \"there was a complete failure of the 'Fuel Injector System' and needed replacement\". Was told that the \"entire fuel injector system failed allowing fuel to soak and flood into the cylinder and spark plugs\". This was ALARMING. Luckily, we knew to pull the car over and keep the RPMs below 1500, and only traveled a few miles. Had we been driving for a while, or the engine had been hot I do not think a rupture of the entire fuel injection system that again is located in the cylinders of the engine would have ended well. Kia Service now telling me the \"Lifetime Warranty\" on engine is not applicable bc a code did not get captured. The fact that my car previously captured that code speaks to the fact that the engine was faulty on production, misaligned, allowing damage to occur from mile 1 on. ECU upgrades and replaced bearings do not remove the damage that was previously sustained by the migration of metal shavings throughout the engine compartment for the  90,000 miles before it was detected and repairs were made. While the \"Lifetime Warranty\" speaks to engine replacement and engine repairs the original class action suit was due to engine fires, which you all (NHTSA) determined in its reporting that the exact cause of the fires in all cases was \u201cundetermined\u201d; noting dealers should be looking at fuel and or oil leaks within the engine.

While researching what to do if your engine overheats, I came across the issues Kia has been having with their engines. I had the car towed to the dealership for inspection and was told my vehicle would not be covered because I didn\u2019t do the product replacement which I had no knowledge of. After calling the manufacturer and talking to several reps I was ultimately blamed for the defect and not knowing about the problem so therefore it\u2019s not Kia\u2019s responsibility to fix my vehicle. One rep told me that Kia sent out notices according to DMV records, which means I should have received a notice. Another rep discovered that they did not have a correct address for me on file and said that it was my fault because I am supposed to update my address when I purchased the vehicle. I was also told by a supervisor that customers that buy new cars get priority in being contacted and that used car costumers are supposed to notify the manufacture when they buy a car so that\u2019s why I received no notification of the recalls or product replacement. I received less than adequate customer service, and being blamed for a problem that resulted for Kias negligence is totally unacceptable.",

On the 1st 1000 mile test, 2 qts of oil were consumed. 2nd 1000 mile test 1.2 qts of oil were consumed. 3rd 1000 mile test 1.5 qts of oil were consumed. All results were reported to KIA. The 3rd oil consumption test was completed on 5/27/21 (miles 95,065) and I went home and checked the oil level on the dipstick, which was filled correctly to the full mark. On 5/28/21 the service mgr called to schedule an engine compression test on 6/8/21.

Delivered car to KIA for the engine compression test on 6/8/21, told service mgr of the 1 qt oil consumption in 445 miles, and he  informed me that if the compression test is good, KIA will direct an engine cleaning procedure per KIA TSB 222. When TSB 222 was completed, they stated another 1000 mile oil consumption test had to be completed. On 6/9/21 I returned to the KIA dealer to pick up my car. Requested to check the engine oil level with the mechanic since this was the start of the 1000 mile test. The car was returned to the service floor, time was allowed for oil draindown, and the mechanic pulled the dipstick which indicated the oil was overfilled by approx 1/3 quart. Took a picture of the dipstick level. The service manager was told of the situation. No action was taken. They sealed the dipstick and I departed. Printed TSB 222 from NHTSA website. On 6/24/21 returned for 1000 mile check. I witnessed (took picture) mechanic check the oil and he said it was less than a qt. I showed service mgr the overfill picture. He change the consumption to 1 qt. Spoke with KIA mgr. He said another 1000 mile check was to be performed. Since TSB 222 states oil is to be filled to full mark, their test is invalid.",

IT SEEMED AS IF CAR WAS STILL TRYING TO ACCELERATE AFTER IT HIT THE CURB BECAUSE THERE ARE SKID MARKS FROM THE TIRES AFTER IMPACT. WHEN THE CAR STOPPED, THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WERE NO LONGER STUCK. THE STEERING WHEEL ROTATED PROPERLY AND BRAKE PEDAL PRESSED DOWN WITH EASE. BECAUSE OF BROKEN WHEEL, CAR WAS NOT OPERABLE AFTERWARD AND WAS TOWED TO COLLISION CENTER.

KIA FAILED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE, ALTHOUGH INDICATING THEY WOULD SEND AN INSPECTOR OUT TO CHECK THE VEHICLE. LATER IT WAS INDICATED THE VEHICLE HAD 2 RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH IT (#1. 16V7050000 AND #2. 16V231000), HOWEVER, KIA FAILED TO HONOR THE RECALLS OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAILING TO PROPERLY INFORM OF THE DEFECTS. NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO REACH SOMEONE AT KIA TO RESOLVE THE MATTER, BUT EACH TIME A DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED MR. GUSTAVIO VALILA WAS THE PERSON HANDLING THE MATTER AND WOULD RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER. VOICE MAILS WERE LEFT UNRETURNED AND EMAILS WERE SENT, HOWEVER, MR. VALILA COULD NOT BE REACHED. A YEAR LATER A REPRESENTATIVE RESPONDED INDICATING THAT THE AIR BAG WAS NOT MEANT TO DEPLOY AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS SORRY FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.
