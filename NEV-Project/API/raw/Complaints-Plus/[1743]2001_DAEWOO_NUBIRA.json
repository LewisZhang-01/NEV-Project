I FEEL THE CONTROL ARMS' INADEQUACIES ARE CATASTROPHES WAITING TO HAPPEN.  THE CONTROL ARMS ARE FAULTY AND COULD CAUSE STEERING FAILURE.  THIS IS A PART THAT IS REPLACED ON THIS CAR MODEL TOO OFTEN.  WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE $700 TO PAY FOR REPAIR?  I ASK THIS BECAUSE WHEN I DRIVE THE DAEWOO IT IS INCREASING DIFFICULT TO HOLD IT ON THE ROAD DUE TO THE FRONT END RACK AND PINION STEERING JERKING LEFT AND RIGHT.  I LIMIT MY DRIVING TO THE SUPERMARKET AND SMALL ERRANDS BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM, AND BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT I DRIVE SLOWLY AND ON SMALL STREETS.  GETTING ON THE HIGHWAY IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.  I WAS TOLD BY THE TECHNICIAN AT MOTOR CITY, ODESSA, TEXAS, 432-550-8721, THAT THE BALL JOINT MAY FALL FROM THE FRAME CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL.  I NEED REPLACEMENT OF THESE CRUCIAL PARTS.  I CAN LIVE WITH PEELING PAINT, BARELY FUNCTIONING ELECTRIC WINDOWS, AND A NON FUNCTIONING AIR CONDITIONER, BUT I CANNOT LIVE WITH A STEERING PROBLEM THAT IS VEERING OUT OF CONTROL.  I KNOW THAT DAEWOO IS NO LONGER IN BUSINESS - BUT GMC IS.  I ALSO KNOW THAT THE RATIO OF DAEWOOS TO OTHER AUTOMOBILES ON THE ROAD IS LOW; HOWEVER, ANY FUNCTION OR PART ON A PRODUCT THAT MAY CAUSE EVEN ONE ACCIDENT DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY YOUR DEPARTMENT.
