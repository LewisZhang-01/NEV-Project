ON 10 SEP 2009 WE HAD THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE STICK & OVERHEAT ABOUT 6-8 MILES FROM HOME. AFTER CALLING WORKHORSE FOR ASSISTANCE I DECIDED TO HAVE THE BRAKES CHECKED. BOTH FRONT CALIPERS WERE STICKING. THE LEFT FRONT ROTOR HAD HEAT DAMAGE & BRAKE PAD TRANSFER ON THE ROTOR. THE RIGHT FRONT ROTOR HAD MANY SMALL HEAT CRACKS WITH ONE LARGE RADIAL CRACK ACROSS & THROUGH THE ENTIRE BRAKING SURFACE AND ALSO HAD BRAKE PAD TRANSFER ON THE ROTOR. PHOTOS WERE TAKEN OF THE DAMAGED CALIPERS, ROTORS & BRAKE PADS AND EMAILED TO WORKHORSE FOR APPROVAL OF REPLACEMENT OF THESE DAMAGED ITEMS. WORKHORSE COVERED THE TWO BOSCH BRAKE CALIPERS BUT REFUSED TO COVER ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS SAYING THEY WERE DAMAGED DURING NORMAL OPERATION. THE SERVICE MANAGER, SERVICE ADVISOR AND SERVICE TECH AT THE WORKHORSE FACILITY I TOOK THE MOTORHOME TO, ALL SAID THE STICKING CALIPERS CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ROTORS & PADS. I CONTACTED THE SAME WORKHORSE TECH (WHO DENIED OUR CLAIM) TWICE TO EXPLAIN THAT I HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL BRAKE FOR THE VEHICLE WE TOW, THAT I DON'T RIDE THE BRAKE AND I DON'T BRAKE HARD TO STOP. I EVEN ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT I MIGHT BE DOING THAT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE THE DAMAGE TO THE ROTOR & PADS. HE WOULD NOT RESPOND. I HAVE SPENT (OUT OF POCKET IN THE LAST WEEK) $978.78 TO HAVE THE MOTORHOME FRONT BRAKES PUT BACK INTO PROPER WORKING ORDER. I BOUGHT A NEW ROTOR FOR THE RIGHT FRONT, I HAD THE LF ROTOR TURNED, BOUGHT SEALS, REPLACED BRAKE PADS BOTH SIDES & REPLACED THE BRAKE FLUID. I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE DAMAGED PARTS & THE CRACKED ROTOR. WITHOUT SOME INTERVENTION I DOUBT THAT I WILL EVER BE COMPENSATED FOR THE COST I HAVE INCURRED. I'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR 50 YRS. AND I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY BRAKE PROBLEMS ON ANY VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED. *TR  UPDATED 11/04/09",

I CALLED WORKHORSE AND THEY AGREED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE RECALL. HOWEVER,DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS THEY ARE SAYING CERTAIN PARTS ARE MAINTENANENCE PARTS AND ARE THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT BUILDUP. AN EXAMPLE IS THE BRAKE FLUID, WHICH BRAKES DOWN UNDER HIGH HEAT CONDITIONS.  THEY SAY IT IS A MAINTENANCE ITEM BECAUSE THE BRAKES SHOULD BE BLED ONCE A YEAR (THIS IS NOT IN THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL).  THIS PROCEDURE LOSES AN OUNCE OF BREAK FLUID AND DOES NOT REQUIRE A COMPLETE PURGE OF THE BREAK SYSTEM, WHICH IS REQUIRED WHEN THE BRAKE FLUID IS EXPOSED TO EXCESSIVE HEAT.  ALSO THE ROTORS ARE CONSIDERED A MAINTENANCE ITEM  WHEN CHANGING THE BRAKE PADS. DURING THIS REPAIR PROCESS THE ROTORS ARE NOT COVERED, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE OBVIOUS DAMAGE, UNLESS THEY ARE STARTING TO DISINTEGRATE.  I BELIEVE IF THESE ITEMS NEED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT DAMAGE THEY SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE RECALL AND NOT BE CONSIDERED MAINTENANCE ITEMS AND CUSTOMER RESOPNSIBILITY.  I AM FULLY AWARE OF NORMAL MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND KEEP THE MAINTENANCE ON MY MOTOR HOME CURRENT.  I JUST DON'T BELIEVE I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTENANCE ITEMS WHEN THEY FAIL DUE TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. *TR",
