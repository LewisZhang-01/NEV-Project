I HAVE PUT OVER 30,000 MILES ON THE 3.2 TL SINCE WE BOUGHT IT AND HAD NO PROBLEMS UNTIL THE TRANSMISSION STARTED SLIPPING.    AFTER VISITING WITH MY MECHANIC AND THE LOCAL ACURA SERVICE DEPARTMENT REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION WE DISCOVERED THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON THE TRANSMISSION AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS DONE IN JANUARY OF 2005.  AT SOME POINT, ACURA ALSO EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE OF AN INTERNAL PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION THAT CAUSED IT TO SLIP AFTER IT WARMED UP.    I FEEL WE HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE LURCH WITH A TRANSMISSION ACURA KNOWS IS FAULTY.  THE CAR WAS IN AN ACCIDENT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, BEFORE WE BOUGHT IT, AND YOU ARE TELLING US THE ACCIDENT VOIDS THE WARRANTY.  IF THE ACCIDENT CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP A LONG TIME AGO.  I DON?T THINK BODY WORK ON A CAR ? NO MATTER HOW EXTENSIVE ?

THE MOST RECENT FAILURE I WAS STUCK 80 MILES FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA  IN THE HOT DESERT.  IT COST ME $480.00 TO BE TOWED TO THE LOCAL ACURA IN LAS VEGAS AND WAS STRANDED  OVER NIGHT, LOSING A DAYS WORK.  I HAD ONLY PLANNED AND WAS PREPARED FOR A DAY TRIP TO PRIMM, NEVADA ON MY OFF DAY.  I WAS FORCED TO RENT A CAR FOR $50.00 AND GET A HOTEL ROOM.  THE LOCAL DEALER SAID THE 2ND AND 3RD GEARS HAD FROZEN AND HE WOULD CHARGE ME $7000.00 TO REPAIR THE TRANSMISSON.

MY COMPLAINT IS (1)THE DEALER TRIED TO TELL ME THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE & THAT THESE KINDS OF THING HAPPEN TO ALL MAKES OF CARS (2) AFTER ORDERING THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION, THEY TRIED TO GIVE ME BACK THE CAR UNTIL THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION CAME IN.

THEIR DAILY ALLOWANCE FOR THE RENTAL WAS $30 PER DAY WHICH MEANT I HAD TO PAY MORE FOR A BIGGER, SAFER CAR AS THAT AMOUNT WOULD ONLY PAY FOR A SMALL CAR.  TODAY IN THE L.A. TIMES IS AN ARTICLE DISCUSSING  THE FAILURE OF TRANSMISSIONS ON THE ACURA 3.5 TLS AND THE REFUSAL OF HONDA TO RECALL THESE CARS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED YET.  MY CONCERN IS, THAT IN MY SITUATION, THE DEALER WOULD NOT BE HONEST ABOUT THE PROBLEMS HONDA IS EXPERIENCING WITH THESE CARS.  MOREOVER, I WAS BASICALLY LIED TOO & TOLD THAT THEY HADN'T HEARD OF ANY OTHER TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH 2001 ACURAS.  AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THEY ALSO TRIED TO GIVE THE CAR BACK, UNREPAIRED, WHILE WAITING FOR A REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION.  I AM EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH THE DEALERSHIP & ACURA OVER THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  THIS CAR IS LEASED & I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE CAR BACK (ALTHOUGH THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REPLACED) AS I DON'T FEEL THAT THE CAR IS THE QUALITY VEHICLE THAT I FELT I WAS PURCHASING.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN TRYING TO PASS SOMEONE, THE TRANSMISSION WILL SUDDENLY LEAVE THE ENGINE REVVING HIGH, BUT THE CAR WON\u0012T ACTUALLY ACCELERATE AND ACTUALLY SLOWS DOWN, SOMETIMES VERY NOTICEABLY.
