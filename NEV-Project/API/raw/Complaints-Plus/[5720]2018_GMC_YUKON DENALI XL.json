THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER (BOMMARITO BUICK GMC WEST COUNTY, 15736 MANCHESTER RD, ELLISVILLE, MO 63011, (636) 391-7200) MORE THAN TWICE, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE A REMEDY TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE AND THE CONTACT ASKED FOR AN ALIGNMENT. ON THE SECOND VISIT, AN ALIGNMENT WAS PERFORMED AND THE TIRES WERE ROTATED AND BALANCED; HOWEVER, THE FAILURE CONTINUED. ON THE THIRD VISIT, THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THE TIRES WERE OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND ONE TIRE WAS REPLACED; HOWEVER, THE SHAKING CONTINUED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER PROVIDED NO SPECIFIC REMEDY AND PROVIDED THE VEHICLE AS A TRADE-IN FROM A 2017 GMC YUKON DENALI XL, WHICH EXHIBITED THE SAME FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 5,000.",
