Engine idles very rough, high pitch idle, and  RPMs surge up and down on their own.  Dealer won\u2019t believe us. They don\u2019t want to use resources to fix what is covered by warranty. This car is a danger to drive. Has also stalled unexpectedly.  Dealer only looks for software update and warning lights. We\u2019ve never had a warning light and updates do absolutely nothing. Forums show others are experiencing the same thing.  Dealer said they cannot spend that amount of time to find the problem. This is a liability and major safety issue that Range Rover needs to be addressed.  Car has 9000 miles.  Car shutters and bounces. RPMS unpredictable and car has idling issues. Please help -we don\u2019t want to hit someone because the car unexpectedly  lunges forward.",
