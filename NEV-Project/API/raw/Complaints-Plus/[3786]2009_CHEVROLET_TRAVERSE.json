STATE PATROL HAD TO COME OUT AND MOVE THE VEHICLE AND ASSURE MY SAFETY OF EXITING ON THIS VERY DARK INTERSTATE. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT EVEN START UP AGAIN. AND THIS WAS THREE DAYS FOLLOWING A TUNE-UP W/6 NEW COIL PACKS, OIL CHANGE W/FILTER AND FLOW VENT. AND ALL THIS COST ALMOST 600.00 BUCKS BECAUSE COILS ARE NEARLY 45.00 PER COIL.  AND ALL THIS HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF A CONSTANT MISFIRE IN ALL OF MY CYLINDERS. SO I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED 48 MILES HOME AND THEN 16 MILES TO THE DEALER JUST TO BE TOLD THAT THIS TRUCK HAS A TIMING CHAIN RECALL THAT WAS NEVER DONE. SO I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP TO CALL CHE Y CORPORATE OFFICE. LOL. CHEVROLET TOLD ME THAT THE THE RECALL EXPIRED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TIMING CHAIN MYSELF. AFTER 2 YEARS OF CONSTANT SPENDING. IM DONE AND HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO SUE. THE TROOPER CALLED TO FOLLOW UP WITH ME BECAUSE I DID ALMOST DIE ON THE INTERSTATE BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WENT COMPLETELY OUT AND 18 WHEELERS WERE GOING EXTREMELY FAST. AND HE PROVIDED ME WITH A COMPLETE POLICE REPORT TO GO AFTER CHEVY. MY TWO KIDS NOW HATE THE VEHICLE. MY DAUGHTER CRIED ALL THROUGH THE 4TH OF JULY BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA. AND CHEVY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL FAMILY VEHICLES WITHOUT HAVING A FAMILIES SAFETY IN MIND. THIS WAS MY FIRST CHEVY PURCHASE AND IT WILL BE MY LAST. THIS IS NOT A COMPANY I WISH TO SUPPORT. BECAUSE IT COULD CARELESS ABOUT OUR LIVES AND SAFETY. I REFUSE TO PAY ANOTHER 2K TO REPAIR AN ISSUE THAT HAD A RECALL THAT I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT. #2NDOWNERSCLUB",

HAD A REAL BATTLE TURNING THE WHEEL WHEN ADJUSTING MY PARKING INTO A STALL IN A PARKING GARAGE. VERY FRUSTRATING. I SEE OTHER GM VEHICLES GETTING RECALLED FOR POWER STEERING ISSUES.

NOT EXCITED ABOUT EITHER BUT IF CONTINUES TO WORSEN, WON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS VEHICLE AND POOR SERVICE AT THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT.

THROUGH TRAVERSEFORUM.COM I HAVE LEARNED THAT OTHER TRAVERSE LT AND LTZ DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED OR ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. THE LS MODELS DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AS THEY HAVE NO STEERING GEAR VALVE SOLENOID WHICH THE LT AND LTZ MODELS DO HAVE. I HAVE CHECKED THE POWER STEERING FLUID RESERVOIR AND IT IS AT THE PROPER LEVEL. GM NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE WRECKS OR CAUSES A WRECK BECAUSE OF THIS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT STEERING PROBLEM. LUCKILY IT IS ONLY OCCURRING AT LOW SPEEDS. I HAVE ORDERED THIS SOLENOID WHICH IS ON BACKORDER WHICH IMPLIES TO ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.

THE DAY WE LEFT THE SHOP, THE LIGHT WAS BACK ON AND WITHIN A DAY THE CAR WAS LOSING POWER AGAIN. BACK TO THE SHOP ON 2/17/11. THIS TIME THEY REPLACED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THE DAY AFTER WE LEFT THE SHOP THE LIGHT WAS BACK ON. THEY TOLD US IT NEEDED A SMALL ADJUSTMENT AND TO BRING IT BACK ON 3/05/11. WE WENT TO THE SHOP AND THE MECHANIC DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT. AFTER BEING THERE FOR A FEW HOURS AND CALLING CHEVY 800 #, THEY TOLD US TO COME BACK NEXT WEEK. ON 3/06/11, THE CAR WAS LOSING POWER SO BAD THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE SHOP, BUT THEY WERE CLOSED. ON 3/07/11 THE TRAVERSE STARTED LOSING POWER, AND THEN DIED. IT LOST ALL POWER AND THE BRAKES FAILED AS A RESULT. WE HAD TO SLAM ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT, AND WERE LUCKY TO NOT BE REAR ENDED. THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE SHOP THE WEEK OF 3/07/11-3/11/11. THEY TOLD US THE CAR IS MISFIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS AND DUMPING RAW GAS INTO THE EXHAUST. ON 3/11/11 THEY CALLED TO STATE THAT THEY ARE REPLACING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER (AGAIN) AND THE MODULE AND RETURNING THE VEHICLE ON 3/14/11.  *TR",
