CONTACTED MCI IN 2015 AFTER 1 OF THE PIECES OF GLASS ACTUALLY ALMOST FELL OUT. MFGR REFUSES TO HONOR WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY SHIPPED REPLACEMENT GLASS TO THE PREVIOUS VEHICLE OWNER FOR THEM TO INSTALL THEMSELVES. DEFECTIVE SI-GI GLASS STILL IN THE COACH. MFGR PRACTICE OF SHIPPING REPLACEMENT GLASS TO OWNERS IS A VERY BAD IDEA. MFGR DOES NOT ACTUALLY VERIFY THAT THE WORK WAS COMPLETED. I'M SURE 95% OF OWNERS NEVER GET AROUND TO INSTALLING IT OR JUST KEEP THE GLASS AS SPARES, SO THE RECALL IS ACTUALLY NEVER COMPLETED. AS TEMPORARY FIX, WE RE-BONDED THE GLASS THAT WAS COMING DE-BONDED, BUT IT IS BECOMING DE-BONDED AGAIN, SINCE GLASS ON THE BUS HAS BOWED. WE WANT MFGR TO HONOR THE RECALL, AS IT WAS NEVER DONE, AND GLASS IS VERY BAD.",
