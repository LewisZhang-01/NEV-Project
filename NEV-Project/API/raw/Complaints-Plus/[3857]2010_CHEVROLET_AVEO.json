THEY TRIED THE NEW INSTRUMENT PANEL& IT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM (FUSES STILL BLOWING).  ON 8/26/14, HEIDEBREICHT'S TOLD ME THAT GM TOLD THEM TO ORDER ANOTHER INSTRUMENT PANEL & IF THAT DIDN'T WORK, THEN GM WAS GOING TO SEND THEIR ENGINEERS OUT TO HELP THEM FIX THE PROBLEM. OUR CAR HAS BEEN DOWN FOR THIS PROBLEM FOR 13 DAYS NOW & THERE IS NO RESOLUTION YET, EVEN FROM GM ENGINEERS. ARE THERE ANY RECALLS, TSB'S OR ANYTHING ON FILE FOR THIS ISSUE?

THINKING IT WAS JUST LOSS OF COOLANT, HE ADDED MORE TO THE RESERVOIR, BUT TO NO AVAIL. HE DECIDED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND IT WAS DETERMINED A RADIATOR PART WAS FAULTY. THE RADIATOR AND THERMOSTAT WERE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1,000. IT TOOK A WEEK AND A HALF, BEFORE THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE CONSUMER. TOW MONTHS LATER, WHILE DRIVING, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED, WHEN HE ARRIVED TO HIS DESTINATION, HE EXITED THE VEHICLE, BUT DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING UT OF THE ORDINARY, HE RESEALED THE GAS CAP, BECAUSE HE KNEW SOMETIMES, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ENGINE LIGHT TO ILLUMINATED. HOWEVER, LATER ON WHEN HE TRIED TO DRIVE HOME, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHIFT GEARS OR GO OVER 40 MPH. THE CONSUMER TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A FRIEND, WHO WAS A MECHANIC. AN INSPECTION REVEALED IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM RELATED TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE RADIATOR TWO MONTHS EARLIER. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER, WHERE THE REPAIR WAS MADE, UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY. FOUR DAYS AFTER GETTING THE BACK, THE CONSUMER NOTICED A HOSE WAS HANGING FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE. THE CONSUMER CALLED HIS MECHANIC FRIEND AGAIN, WHERE HE DISCOVERED THE TECHNICIAN AT THE DEALER, DID NOT RE-ATTACH THE TRANSMISSION TO THE RADIATOR.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER.",
