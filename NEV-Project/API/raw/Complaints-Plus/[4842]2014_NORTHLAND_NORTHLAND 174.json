        "summary": "PURCHASED A BRAND NEW NORTHLAND TRAVEL TRAILER FROM SUNSET R.V. IN BONNEY LAKE, WA ON 5/24/14. THE DEALER DELIVERED THE TRAILER TO OUR HOME AS WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR BRAKE CONTROLLER YET. ON 6/30/14 WE INSTALLED OUR BRAKE CONTROLLER AND TOOK THE TRAILER TO GO OUT FOR OUR FIRST CAMPING TRIP. WE DROVE TO THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR TO WORK ON GETTING THE BRAKE CONTROLLER ADJUSTED. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE BRAKES TO RESPOND. WE DROVE THE TRAILER AROUND 2 MILES INTO BUCKLEY, WA WERE THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS LOCATED. AFTER 3 WEEKS OF PLAYING WITH THEM AND REPLACING COMPONENTS THEY WERE STILL NOT ABLE TO FIX THEM AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG OR HOW TO FIX THEM. DURING THAT TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE ALSO PULLED 6 MORE UNITS OFF THE LOT WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT ANOTHER PERSON BROUGHT THEIR TRAILER BACK FOR AN UNRELATED PROBLEM AND THEY TESTED THEIR BRAKES AND FOUND THEM TO BE NON FUNCTIONING ALSO. I AM CONCERNED THERE ARE MORE TRAILERS OUT THERE ON THE ROAD THAT HAVE NON WORKING BRAKES AND IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THEY WERE CALLING ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE THEM BRING BACK THE TRAILERS TO TEST THEM. THEY DELIVERED A TRAILER TO ME WITHOUT WORKING BRAKES THERE SHOULD BE NO EXCUSE WHY THIS WAS NOT FOUND IN ANY QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS BEFORE THESE TRAILERS WERE SOLD.  *TR",
