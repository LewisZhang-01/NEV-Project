        "summary": "I have a 2000 Sienna with 305000 miles. I have never had trouble with this vehicle until about 2 weeks ago. When I am stopped and my car is in drive, I just tap the gas pedal for a second and the engine RPM will increase to about 2000 RPM and will stay there until I put the car in neutral or turn the engine off. This is a problem because my breaks barely hold this and I must put the car into neutral for the car to stop pulling forward. Putting the car into neutral resets the rpm. If there is no car in front of me, I can release the brakes and the vehicle will continue to accelerate until the transmission switches to second gear, at this point I can drive normally.  One time the vehicle continued to accelerate even after switching gears, I put the vehicle into neutral and the engine went to over 4000 RPM, the brakes could not stop the vehicle, I had to turn the engine off. The gas pedal is not sticky or stuck, floor mats are not in the vehicle. I can rev the engine normally when I am in park, this only happens when I am in gear.  I have checked the Throttle Body, Throttle Position Sensor and disabled the cruise control module, I can see no reason for this to happen. I have seen many complaints about this same issue online but have not found a resolution. I can buy an ECM but this is an expensive trial. I will take it to the dealer from here.",

THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIMES WHILE DRIVING EAST ON ILLINOIS AVENUE IN DALLAS AND IT FINALLY DIED COMPLETELY ON THE SAME STREET . THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START AND EVEN THE LIGHTS WOULD NOT COME ON. I WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO THE CITY OF DALLAS'S PARKING LOT BEFORE THE VEHICLE STOPPED COMPLETELY. I HAD THE VAN TOWED TO ONE OF THE TOYOTA DEALERS IN DALLAS. THEY CHECKED IT OUT AND COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.  THEN ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25 THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY DEAD IN OUR GARAGE AT HOME. I JUMP STARTED THE VEHICLE AND DROVE IT AGAIN TO METROPLEX TOYOTA ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5. THE ONLY THING THEY FOUND WAS THE INTAKE HOSE CLAMP AT T-BODY WAS VERY LOOSE AND THE POWER DOOR LIGHT WAS COMING ON. THEY TIGHTENED THE HOSE CLAMP AND RE-INITIALIZED THE POWER DOOR.  AGAIN, ON NOVEMBER 11, I WAS DRIVING EAST ON I 30 WHEN THE VAN COMPLETELY DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. EVEN THE HAZARD LIGHTS WOULD NOT COME ON. I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY FREEWAY. FORTUNATELY, I 30 WAS BACKED UP AND NO ONE PLOWED INTO THE REAR BECAUSE MOST VEHICLES DRIVE AT 60-70 MPH ON THAT FREEWAY. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO METROPLEX TOYOTA AGAIN. THIS TIME THE ONLY THING THEY COULD FIND WRONG WAS THAT THE BATTERY WAS NOT HELD DOWN TIGHTLY. HOWEVER, WHILE I WAS GOING TO DRIVE AWAY IN THE VAN, I NOTICED THAT THE POWER DOOR LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN AND THE DOOR WOULD NOT CLOSE PROPERLY. WE FINALLY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE WITH THE DEALER FOR SOME TIME SO IT COULD BE CHECKED OUT.",

I REPORTED THE STUCK ACCELERATOR TO DEALER, AND STATE FARM. MY CAR WAS TOTALED.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AT AN INTERSECTION AND ANOTHER DRIVER HIT ME FROM THE RIGHT - HE RAN A RED LIGHT AND WAS CITED AS AT FAULT, BUT AFTER THE IMPACT, MY CAR CONTINUED TO GO FORWARD AND ALTHOUGH I HAD MY FOOT ON MY BRAKE ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP. I HAD MY TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE CAR WHO WERE SCREAMING IN FEAR AND PAIN, AND THERE WERE TWO ROWS OF CARS IN EVERY DIRECTION STOPPED AT THE INTERSECTION. I LOOKED AT A CONCRETE PILLAR IN A PARKING LOT AND THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING MY CAR INTO IT TO STOP. INSTEAD, I REACHED FOR THE GEARS AND TRIED TO SHIFT TO PARK. IT WENT INTO REVERSE, AND BY SOME TRUE MIRACLE, I WAS ABLE TO MISS ALL THE SITTING TRAFFIC AND STEER INTO A CHAIN LINK FENCE. BY YET ANOTHER MIRACLE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE SPOT ON THE FENCE THAT WAS NOT TREE LINED.  I BACKED BETWEEN TWO TREES INTO THE FENCE AND THAT STOPPED MY CAR, WHICH I LEFT RUNNING AS I GOT MY TWO CHILDREN OUT. A BYSTANDER WAS ABLE TO REACH IN AND REMOVE THE KEYS AND STOP THE CAR.   THE FENCE BELONGED TO A CATHOLIC CHURCH WHICH LATER SENT A BILL TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY FOR THE DAMAGE. THIS OCCURRED IN MEMPHIS, TN, AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SURE THAT THE ACCELATOR WAS STUCK IN THAT INCIDENT. I WAS TOLD TO REPORT IT TO THE NTHSA, BUT FRANKLY, THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED LIKE REDTAPE. I DON'T THINK THE TOYOTA PROBLEM IS MECHANICAL OR RECENT, BUT A MASSIVE, LONG-STANDING COMPUTER-BASED ISSUE COVER-UP AND TOYOTA DRIVERS SHOULD BE COMPENSATED BY COMPANY. *TR",

IT WAS INSPECTED BY THE BODY SHOP WHO SAID THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG & ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER.  THE FILLING PROBLEM CONTINUED & ACTUALLY GOT WORSE & WAS TAKING LONGER & LONGER TO FILL.  TODAY I WENT TO FILL IT GOT TO ABOUT 2 1/2 GALLONS AND FUEL STARTED COMING OUT OF THE TANK AS IF I OVERFILLED IT. I TRIED TO FILL IT AGAIN IT DID THE SAME THING EVERY TIME.

THE CAR WAS RECENTLY AT A TOYOTA DEALER MAINTENANCE CENTER.   I FEEL THAT THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CHECK THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT.   IN REVIEWING THE NHTSA DATABASE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE ACROSS AUTOMOBILES.  I WOULD EXPECT THEIR TO BE SOME RECURRING MAINTENANCE ON THE LATCHING MECHANISM (AT 30,000 OR 60,000 MILES) TO PREVENT SUCH AN INCIDENT FROM OCCURRING...I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SHOP MAINTENANCE MANUALS SO I DON'T KNOW IF SUCH AN INSPECTION IS IN THE MANUALS.

THE COOLING CHAMBER PASSAGES TO THE CYLINDERS WERE REDUCED IN SIZE TO REDUCE HAZARDOUS EMISSIONS WHICH HAD THE UNANTICIPATED SIDE EFFECT OF CAUSING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CYLINDER HEADS TO REACH UP TO 130 DEGREES.  FOR MANY OWNERS, THIS HAS CAUSED THE OIL TO OXIDIZE FORMING A SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE WHICH IN OUR CASE LED TO ENGINE FAILURE IN OUR 2000 TOYOTA SIENNA VAN REQUIRING ENGINE REPLACEMENT AT 59,000 MILES COSTING OVER $8,000.  THE SAME SITUATION OCCURRED WITH OUR 1999 CAMRY.  TOYOTA CLAIMS THAT THIS IS DUE TO NOT CHANGING THE OIL FREQUENTLY ENOUGH, AND THIS MAY BE TRUE.  HOWEVER MY BROTHER'S FRIEND BOUGHT A TOYOTA CELICA BACK IN THE 1970'S AND NEVER CHANGED THE OIL, NEVER EVEN OPENED THE HOOD TO ADD OIL OR MAINTENANCE IT AT ALL - JUST DROVE IT UNTIL QUIT - AT 80,000 MILES.  GRANTED THIS IS NOT ADVISABLE BUT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT WHILE LESS THAN OPTIMAL OIL CHANGE FREQUENCIES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS ENGINE FAILURE PROBLEM IN THE 1999-2001 MODELS, BASED ON OTHER RESEARCH I HAVE READ WITH OTHER OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM LEADING TO ENGINE FAILURE IN THESE MODELS EVEN WITH MILEAGES AS LOW AS 29,000 MILES, I DON'T BUY TOYOTA'S ARGUMENT.  WE OWNED 3 TOYOTA'S AT THE TIME, 2 CAMRYS AND 1 SIENNA. BECAUSE TOYOTA DID NOT OWN UP TO THIS DESIGN DEFECT AND REIMBURSE OWNERS FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THEIR FLAWED ENGINE DESIGN WITHOUT THEIR PROVIDING OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS - (E.G. WHAT IF YOU DON'T SAVE RECEIPTS AND/OR WHAT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR OIL YOURSELF)? - FOR THIS REASON I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA.  I OWN A SUBARU WRX AND AM PLANNING TO PURCHASE ANOTHER SUBARU SOON.",

EACH TIME, THE \u001cABS\u001d AND \u001cLOW TIRE PRESSURE\u001d DASHBOARD LIGHT CAME ON. CLOCK FLASHED.  NO \u001cCHECK ENGINE LIGHT\u001d CAME ON.  THE CAR RECOVERED WITHIN 2 TO 3 SECONDS WHILE MOVING, BUT LOST SPEED, AS THE ENGINE WAS NOT RUNNING.    RADIO WAS NOT TURNED ON, NOT SURE IF IT WOULD HAVE LOST POWER ALSO.    COULD DUPLICATE ONE STALL BY TURNING THE HEADLIGHTS ON WHILE MOVING. AGAIN, ENGINE STALLED FOR 2 TO 3 SECONDS, \u001cABS\u001d AND \u001cLOW TIRE PRESSURE\u001d DASHBOARD LIGHT CAME ON.

BUT AGAIN, I'M NOT 100% SURE ON THE ODOMETER NEEDLE GOING TO \"0\" , AS IT ALL HAPPENED FAIRLY FAST.    REPAIR ATTEMPTS:    DROVE TO THE NEAREST TOYOTA DEALER IN DC ON THE SAME DAY, CAR STALLED AGAIN AS WE DROVE INTO THE DEALER SHIP AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STAND STILL.  (TOYOTA OF STAFFORD, TEL: 1-540-720-4700, REPAIR TICKET 16153) THEY TEST DROVE CAR FOR 2 X 20 MINS, FOUND NO PROBLEM, COMPUTER DID NOT LOG ANY ERROR CODES WHAT SO EVER ACCORDING TO DEALER.     DROVE BACK TO NC, WENT TO TOYOTA DEALER IN DURHAM, NC TODAY (JULY 19). DEALER TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO, UNLESS THE CAR IS STALLING RIGHT NOW AND TOLD US TO RETURN ONCE THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT IS ON.    IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR ME THAT THE DEALERS CAN NOT LOCATE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT THERE IS APPARENTLY NO PROCEDURE FROM TOYOTA FOR FINDING CRITICAL PROBLEMS THAT DO NOT SHOW UP IN THE COMPUTER LOG.

MOST OF THE TIME, THE INSIDE LOCK GETS STUCK FROM THE INSIDE AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE PASSENGER CAN GET OUT THAT DOOR.

THIS IS NOT SAFE, ESPECIALLY FOR A PARENT LIKE ME WITH PASSENGER KIDS.  ALSO, THE SIENNA HAS BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH TO THE TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER FOR THE \"UNUSUAL NOISE\" BECOMING APPARENT ESP. WHEN THE CAR ACCELERATES FROM 0-30 MPH.  I HAVE REPORTED THE NOISE WHEN I HAD MY BELTS CHANGED, TRANSMISSION FLUID FLUSHED, AND POWER STEERING BELT REPLACED -- BUT THE NOISE IS STILL THERE AFTER THE SERVICE AND AFTER IT COSTS ME $400.00!  THEN I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE SHOP AND AFTER VISUALLY CHECKING IT, THE SERVICE GUY AT TOYOTA OF TEMECULA VALLEY SAID THAT MY TRANSMISSION IS THE PROBLEM AND IT HAS TO BE REPLACED FOR $3,500.00 + TAX!!  I ASKED HOW COME - CONSIDERING THAT THE CAR OBSERVES THE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE RIGIDLY, NO ROUGH DRIVING, OILS/FILTERS CHANGED REGULARLY, FLUIDS FLUSHED-DRAINED-REFILLED PROPERLY, ETC.  I EVEN HAVE A LIFETIME ALIGNMENT THAT IT GETS REGULARLY CHECKED AND BROUGHT BACK TO SPECS.  THE SERVICE GUY SAID THAT \"IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH ALL SIENNAS\" AND IT IS NO LONGER SURPRISING FOR THEM.  I CHECKED ON THE REVIEWS AND FEEDBACKS AND TO MY SURPRISE, OTHER SIENNA OWNERS HAD THEIR TRANNYS REPLACED 2-3 TIMES ALREADY, THE VAN WILL EMIT THE SAME NOISE EVEN IF IT GETS FIXED, TRANNYS ACT OUT EVEN AT 15,000 MILES!  MY CONTENTION IS THAT IS THE SERVICE SHOPS OF TOYOTA ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THAT PROBLEM, HOW COME IT DOESN'T GET RECALLED AND LET THEM FIX THE PROBLEM BEFOREHAND?  I AM A SINGLE PARENT AND GETS NO CHILD SUPPORT FROM ANYBODY -- AND FOR A YOUNG CAR LIKE MINE IN YEARS AND VERY WELL MAINTAINED AND DEAL WITH A BIG TRANNY PROBLEM INSTANTLY REQUIRING BIG CASH, I FIND IT UNFAIR.*AK",

FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRES I HAVE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS SOON?  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN, THANK YOU.( DOT NUMBER: BM13571-4 TIRE SIZE: P265/75R15 )",

THE MANUAL HAS A WARNING SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE SERIOUS INJURY COULD RESULT.

TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, ONCE I DISABLED THE POWER DOOR VIA A BUTTON NEAR THE STEERING COLUMN, THE DOOR BECAME SO DIFFICULT TO MOVE THAT I HAVE TO STRAIN TO USE IT.
