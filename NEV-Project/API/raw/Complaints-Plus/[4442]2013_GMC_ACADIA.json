The vehicle has around 120K miles so out of any warranty.  But this will be the third or fourth time ( not original ow er so dealer has records) that this has happened. Last time in December 2020 I had an extended warranty that covered the passenger module but was not the \"improved\" module with some type of casing to address the corrosion causing the failures as they wanted an  extra $3-400 for that part.  Why they still manufacture the bad part is interesting since they have recognized they have a pro lem with the older part.  Have seen other complaints that not fixing these can result in other electrical failures that can be dangerous even an electrical fire was reported from this.  Obviously I feel the issue is widespread enough for a blanket recall beyond the one issued for 6 y3ears or 80K miles.",

I CALLED 911 AND BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER IT WAS A FULL BLOWN, ROARING FIRE AND THE ENTIRE FRONT END WAS CONSUMED.  MY DRIVEWAY SUFFERED BURN DAMAGE AS WELL.  THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS HURT.  GMC HAS BEEN AWFUL TO DEAL WITH.  THEY HAVE NOT REPLACED MY VEHICLE, NOT REPAIRED MY DRIVEWAY AND HAVE STOPPED RETURNING MY CALLS.  THE FIRE INSPECTOR SAID IT WAS THEIR FAULT AND THINKS IT STEMMED FROM THE HEATING ELEMENT THAT HEATS THE WINDSHIELD FLUID.  THEY ARE STILL DOING MORE TESTING TO GET THE FINAL RESULTS THOUGH.  I FEEL HELPLESS AND TOTALLY IGNORED BY GMC.  I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THROUGH TO THEM AND SIMPLY TO GET MY CAR REPLACED AND MY DRIVEWAY REPAIRED BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY PRODUCT THEY SOLD ME.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND I WILL NOW NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR FROM THEM AND WILL SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS I HAVE SHARING THIS INCIDENT WITH OTHERS CONSIDERING PURCHASING ONE OF THEIR VEHICLES.  I HAVE A VIDEO OF THE WHOLE THING I AM HAPPY TO SHARE.",
