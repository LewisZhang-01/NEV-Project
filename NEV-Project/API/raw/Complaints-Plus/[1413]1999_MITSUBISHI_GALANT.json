I COMPLAINED TO MITSUBISHI MOTOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPARTMENT IN MAY OF 2005. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE EMPLOYEE I SPOKE WITH STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE  PAINT WAS PROBABLY ENVIRONMENTAL, AND THAT BECAUSE  THE CAR WAS OVER THE 3 YEAR, 36,000 MILE MARK THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE.

I HAVE REPLACED ROTORS AND/OR BRAKES PADS AT LEAST EVERY 3000 TO 5000 MILES SINCE THEN BECAUSE I JUST DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY THE DEALERS GAMES.  IT GETS SO BAD THAT I HAVE TO PUMP THE BRAKES EVERY TIME AND THE FRONT END OF THE CAR VIBRATES LIKE IT IS FALLING APART ESPECIALLY GOING DOWN HILL, HAVE TO START PUMPING THE BRAKES AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IN ORDER TO STOP SAFELY.  AND TO TOP THAT OFF, I CALLED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO TAKE MY CAR IN AGAIN LAST SUMMER AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.  THIS HAS GONE ON WASTING MY MONEY FOR OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS, IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR I HAD AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF MY BRAKES, I DID NOT HAVE AMPLE TIME TO APPLY THE BRAKES WHEN ANOTHER DRIVER PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME, THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS HURT, I HAD THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE.  MY QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS GO ON, WHY HAS MITSUBISHI NOT RECALLED THESE CARS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM OR ARE THEY NOT ABLE TO CORRECT IT?  DO THEY NOT HAVE THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE TO LOCATE AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM? DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE SOMEONE AT MITSUBISHI GIVES A [XXX] ABOUT THE POOR CONSTRUCTION AND POSSIBLE INADEQUATE PARTS USED IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM OF THESE CARS??  FROM WHAT I AM ABLE TO FIND OUT THESE PROBLEM STILL EXIST EVEN ON THE BRAND NEW GALANT'S, WHAT IS THE DEAL??    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

IN JUNE OF 2001, I HAD AN A/C IDLER PULLEY REPLACED FOR $150.  AS SOON AS I DROVE AWAY, THE NOISE PRESENTED AGAIN.  I FINALLY GAVE UP ON SITTING AT THE DLRSHP FOR 3 HRS W/A 3 YR OLD, SO I'VE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH IT...YET AGAIN.  THE NOISE STILL PERSISTS AS OF 2/02.  IN MAY OF 2001, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  TO DATE I'VE HAD ALL RECALLS SVCD.  UPON THE START OF MY CAR, THE SUNROOF, LIGHTS, ANYTHING POWER, RADIO, ETC., WERE NOT IN FUNCTION.  I NOTICED THIS THE FIRST TIME AFTER PULLING AWAY.  NUMEROUS TIMES THEREAFTER (2X IN RAIN) I STARTED TO PULL OUT AND TURN ON MY W/SHLD WIPERS TO REALIZE NOTHING WORKED.  MY TEMP. FIX WAS TO SHUT OFF THE CAR AND RESTART AGAIN...PRAYING.  AS OF LATE...I HAVE HAD MY E BRAKE LIGHT LUMINATED FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS, FOR NO REASON.  MY OIL LAMP LIGHT WOULD COME ON HERE AND THERE.  WHEN STARTING MY CAR NOW, SOMETIMES MY RADIO WILL BE \"ON\" BUT, WON'T START WORKING AND WILL EVENTUALLY COME IN FROM THE BACK SPKRS UP TO THE FRONT.  THE OTHER TEMP FIX I'VE FOUND WHEN THINGS AREN'T WORKING, IS TO TURN THE KEY SLIGHTLY BACK TOWARD ME AND IT TURNS THINGS ON.

I HAD TO PULL OFF TO REMOVED THE REMAINDER.  AND GETTING TO THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST STUFF...ONE DAY LAST WEEK, MY LOCKS WOULD NOT STAYED IN THE LOCKED POSITION.

THEY SAID THE ROTORS AND BUSHINGS WERE BAD AND REPLACED THEM.  2 MOS LATER, BACK AGAIN WITH SAME PROBLEM.  SAME THING DONE AGAIN TO FIX.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR BACK 5 TIMES FOR THE EXACT SAME THING.  THE PROBLEM KEEPS RETURNING AFTER ABOUT 2000 MILES EACH TIME, THEY REPLACE THE SAME THING.  I HAVE CONTACTED MITSUBISHI AND THE DEALER PETE MOORE, NO RESPONSE.  I AM AFRAID THERE IS SOMETHING VERY WRONG WITH THIS CAR.  I HAVE FOUND ON THE INTERNET WHERE MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM AND THEY ALSO HAVE TAKEN THEIR CARS IN AND THE EXACT SAME REPAIRS ARE DONE OVER AND OVER.  SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE.  SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.  NO ONE WANTS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I BELIEVE THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SOME OF THESE CARS.  THEY CAN'T FIX IT FOR GOOD.  THE PROBLEM CREEPS BACK WITHIN A COUPLE THOUSAND MILES.  NOW I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  PLEASE, I BELIEVE THIS COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD.  I AM AFRAID TO TRAVEL.  I AM AFRAID THE WHAT IF WHAT EVER IS WRONG WITH THIS CAR THAT THEY CANNOT FIND, WHAT IF IT BREAKS.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  WILL I BE ABLE TO STOP, TO STEER?  WILL I LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR?  SOMETHING IS BAD WRONG HERE.  I FEEL THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE CHECKED OUT.  THANK YOU.*AK",

I WAS POSITIONED AT AN ANGLE. WHEN I BACKED OUT (GOING ABOUT 3-5 MPH), I BUMPED INTO A TREE. I THEN PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES SO THAT I COULD PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE. WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE, THE CAR ACCELLERATED AT AN EXTREME RATE AND MADE A TERRIBLE LOUD NOISE. THE CAR THEN THRUSTED FORWARD (THE ENTIRE TIME MY FOOT WAS HEAVY ON THE BRAKE - I AM 100% SURE OF THIS!). THE BRAKE DID NOT STOP THE CAR. AFTER TRAVELING ABOUT 60 FEET, THE CAR THEN CAREAMED INTO A MOBILE HOME. I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF. I BELIEVE THOUGH THAT THE CAR WAS STOPPED BY THE METAL BEAMS FROM THE MOBILE HOME. THE CAR IS NOW AT THE DEALERSHIP. I AM LOOKING INTO THE LEMON LAW DUE TO THIS INCIDENT AND OTHER PROBLEMS. TRYING TO GET THE CAR REPURCHASED OR REPLACED. *AK",
