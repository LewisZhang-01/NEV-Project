After removing the fuel tank it became obvious that I had a more serious problem with my truck. First, the fuel leak was from a rusted out fuel pump pressure line (on the actual fuel pump). This, in and of itself could have caused a fire as it was probably spraying gas directly onto the muffler!  But then I find something much worse...the Fuel Tank Support Bar was completely rotted out! The Fuel Tank Support bar is part of the frame that hold the gas tank in place!!  I guess I should be happy that it had a gas leak because if it hadn\u2019t, the gas tank could have easily fallen out while I was driving it & could have killed both my wife & I!  The truck is only 8 years old and I was shocked to see it in this condition. I have worked on cars that are over 30 years old and I have never seen this kind of rot on a frame!  I purchased the truck in 2016 and I'm still making monthly payments on it!  I would like to know what GMC is going to do to repair this!  I have called the Dealership that I purchased it from but they were of no help.   I anxiously await your reply!  Thank you!

THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE OLDER BUICK LASABER REAR END OR BUMPER BUT MY FRONT BUMPER WAS PUSHED IN ABOUT 2 INCHES.

WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE TRUCK IS NOT STOPPING OR SLOWING AT ALL AND THE BRAKE PEDAL IS AS FAR DOWN AS IT CAN GO.  PUMPING THE BRAKE WILL CAUSE THE BRAKES TO RECOVER AND THE VEHICLE WILL STOP.

I LIVE IN TEXAS AND BY STATE LAW A VEHICLE CANNOT PASS STATE SAFETY INSPECTION WITH ANY LEAKS ON THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM. HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS LEAK WILL EVEN GO AWAY? MY TRUCK WON'T EVEN PASS INSPECTION LATER THIS YEAR WHEN I HAVE TO GO BECAUSE OF THIS LEAK. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN, THEY SHOULD NOT BE RE ISSUING SUCH A IMPORTANT PART TO THE STEERING SYSTEM AND IT LEAK, I HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH GM AND SAID I WANT A BRAND NEW ON PUT ON AND NO LEAKS, IT DIDN'T LEAK WHEN I BOUGHT IT, IT SHOULDN'T LEAK NOW. I HAVE LOST FAITH IN THE RELIABILITY OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE REPLACE THE SAME PART THREE TIMES( A KEY PART TO THE STEERING SYSTEM), IT LEAKS, AND ALL THREE TIMES THE PART WAS RE-MANUFACTURED( USED), I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY MILES ARE ON THAT PART, THEY SHOULD BE USING BRAND NEW ONES AND NO LEAKS.  *TR",

        "summary": "*ISSUE IS WARNING LIGHT AND TONE THAT THE STABILITRAK SYSTEM REQUIRES SERVICING - THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD WARNING LIGHT THAT THE WHEEL TRACTION VARIES*  I HAD A 2011 GMC SIERRA WHICH I BROUGHT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND CALLED GMC ABOUT FOR 6 ISSUES WITH THE STABILITRAK WARNING LIGHT.  EVEN WITH GMC CORPORATE INVOLVEMENT, ISSUE WAS NOT CORRECTED DESPITE REPLACEMENT OF NUMEROUS SENSORS, ETC.   IN ORDER TO AFFORD TO BUY A NEW 2013 VEHICLE,  I TRADED THAT TRUCK AND ANOTHER FOR THE ABOVE-NOTED GMC TRUCK AND 2-DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE THE SAME PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED AT THE VERY SAME SPOT ON MY DRIVE HOME FROM WORK.  I CALLED GMC AND NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY CANNOT FIX THE PROBLEM SO I WILL WAIT FOR THREE MORE INSTANCES AND WITH DRIVING A LOANER CAR FOR UP TO 3-WEEKS AT A TIME AND WILL INVOLVE THE LEMON LAW FOR DEFECTS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP.  OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO  NOTHING EXCEPT PROVIDE GMC WITH MORE TAXPAYER-FUNDED BAILOUT MONEY!  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT DEFECTS WITH THIS COMPLICATED SYSTEM THAT IS SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE CARS' RUNNING THAT IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED.  WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CONSUMER RIPOFF????  *TR",
