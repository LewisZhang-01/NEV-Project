THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WAS THE HEAT SHIELD FOR THE  CATALYTIC CONVERTER. I LEFT THE VEHICLE OVERNIGHT, IN ORDER FOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO EXPERIENCE THE ANNOYING SOUND, WHEN THEY TEST DROVE IT THE FOLLOWING MORNING. HERE I AM ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS LATER WITH THE PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE IT IS SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A HEAT SHIELD. I HAVE SCHEDULED A SECOND APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE REPAIRED. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCH THE ISSUE ONLINE AND SEE THAT THIS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH SUZUKIS.  *TR",
