An electrical connection in the front passenger seat for the Occupant Detection System (ODS) is causing the airbag sensor to remain in the OFF position even when there is a passenger in the car.

On 10/5/21 we noticed a bulge on the rear driver\u2019s side tire which looked like a tennis ball was emerging. We took it to our mechanic here in Ohio. He said not to drive on it and replaced the tire. It had less than 13,000 miles on it and I thought it should be covered under warranty. We were told the bulge was due to \u201croad hazard\u201d and so wasn\u2019t covered. They said a chuckhole could do this. We have no recollection of anything like that. And a chuckhole would usually affect the front tire, not the rear. Moreover, the mechanic looked at the rim and said it was not dented. So they suggested I contact Cooper Tire.   I paid for the tire and called Cooper. They had me bring the tire to a different shop for evaluation, recommending a Conrad\u2019s Tire nearby. I took it there and the mechanic called Cooper and told them he saw no evidence of road hazard. Cooper then asked me to send the tire to them.  Two weeks later we were in Connecticut and heard a low sound from the tires. We took the car to a local shop 10/19/21 where the mechanic showed us a bulge in the sidewall of the front passenger's side tire near the rim that looked exactly the same as the prior defect albeit somewhat smaller, maybe golf ball size. He said it was dangerous to drive on it and he replaced it.  I have a photograph of the second tire but unfortunately not the first. Except for the noise the second tire made, there was no noise or warning light or other symptom to alert us to either problem. I sent both tires to Cooper by UPS on their dime three weeks ago and have not heard back.   Tire size: M&S 225/60R17 Both tires are DOT U941 1CW 4619 C07R Both were purchased 5/19/20  Thank you in advance for looking into this. I still have two tires on our car purchased at the same time as the two that failed. If there is truly a defect ,either could fail suddenly at any time.  Thank you.",

I know moisture could be an issue, but I don't remember spilling anything recently.  I wanted to report this in case another recall should be made.",

I have since walked with a cane, was required to retire approx 10 years ago, and have routine seizures.    I apologize for this, but I feel the air conditioning should be covered, as in many situations (especially with global warming), the cooling is required for the elderly and for people with medical conditions. Please reconsider allowing the faulty air conditioning systems in 2014 Subaru Foresters to be covered under payment by Subaru. The car referenced belongs to my sister Nancy English, who commonly drives me to places I need to go. The cost is not expected to be too overwhelming, but I feel the Air Conditioning is more important to (many) people, than was established some years ago.

COST ESTIMATE IS ABOUT $1,100 AND I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE PART GETS SHIPPED IN. THEY SAID THE LIKELY CAUSE IS MOISTURE OR THE SEAT GOT WET. I LIVE IN A DRY CLIMATE AREA AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE SEATS WET AT ALL RECENTLY (AND BARELY EVER IN THE PAST).

TAILGATE STRUT SWUNG OUT AS IT WAS STILL PARTIALLY ATTACHED AS BOLTS ON ONE END DID NOT BECOME LOOSE, BUT PREVENTED DOOR FROM CLOSING ALL THE WAY, AS STRUT WAS HANGING (STUCK) OUT OF CARGO DOOR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THIS ALSO CAUSED DOOR OPEN LIGHT AND VEHICLE INTERIOR LIGHTS TO STAY ON. INSPECTION OF THE FAILED SHOWA BRAND STRUT NUMBER 13I062C REVEALED CORROSION ON THE BLACK TUBE AS WELL AS ON THE END OF THE STRUT THAT BROKE OFF ON IT'S TOP END FROM THE VEHICLE. FURTHER INSPECTION REVEALED CORROSION ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE STRUT THAT WAS STILL IN PLACE. DEALER SAID IT WAS NOT SAFE TO LEAVE REMAINING STRUT ON CAR, AS IT WOULD LIKELY FAIL AS WELL. ULTIMATELY DEALER ORDERED THE NEW PARTS AND INSTALLED THEM.  SUBARU OF AMERICA REIMBURSED OWNER FOR REPAIRS AND DEALER HAD OWNER SIGN WAIVER RELEASING SUBARU OF AMERICA FROM ANY PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF THE STRUT FAILURE.

I BELIEVE THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD ISSUE, AND DESERVES A LOOK BY THE NHTSA.     THANKS FOR YOU CONSIDERATION.",

THEN THE OTHER DEALERSHIPS TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE PASSENGER SEAT SENSOR, BUT THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONFIRM IF THIS IS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM CAUSING THE AIRBAG LIGHT TO COME ON AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG TO BE TURNED OFF. THEY SAID I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE PASSENGER SEAT, BUT THEY WERE UNSURE IF THIS WOULD FIX THE ISSUE. I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT MACHANIC AND THEY ALSO WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM AND REFERRED ME BACK TO THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP. I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA ABOUT THE ISSUE AND I NEVER RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION FROM THEM, ALTHOUGH THEY PROMISED TO GET BACK TO ME ABOUT THE ISSUE. I JUST KNOW THERE IS NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO MAKE THIS PROBLEM APPEAR. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURER ISSUE, JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT SUBARU COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS OR IT'S CAUSE. SO FAR I JUST HAVE BEEN TOLD THE PASSENGER SEAT SENSOR IS SOMEHOW DEFECTIVE AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY.",

THEY HAD ME BRING THE CAR BACK IN AFTER 1200 MILES. THEY SAID I DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MY ENGINE BE REPLACED.  I NOW HAVE TO ADD OIL EVERY 2,500 MILES, AT A COST OF $9.00-10.00 A QUART.    THEY STATED THAT IT WAS THE NORM FOR THIS MODEL CAR. I INDICATED THAT I HAVE A VW PASSAT THAT GOES 10,000 MILES BETWEEN OIL CHANGES AND NEVER LOSSES A DROP.    I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED THAT THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WAS ONLY FOR 1200 MILES. THAT DID NOT PROVE THAT THERE WAS NOT A PROBLEM.    WHY DID SUBARU ONLY HAVE OIT FOR 1200 MILES. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FOCUS ON OFFSETTING CUSTOMERS OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR THE REST OF THE TIME THEY OWN THERE CAR.  AS I DO DRIVE A LOT OF MILES FOR MY BUSINESS, I SPEND ON AVERAGE $140 A YEAR JUST ON BUYING OIL FOR BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. IT IS ALSO INCONVENIENT IF I AM TRAVELING AND I AM SOMEWHERE WERE I CAN NOT FIND FULL SYNTHETIC OIL IN THE PROPER WEIGHT WHICH CONCERNS ME AS I MY FAMILY AND I LIKE TO VACATION IN THE MANY DIFFERENT CAMP GROUNDS AROUND MARYLAND AND THE SURROUNDING STATES.",

MY CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH EYESIGHT SYSTEM, WHICH WILL APPLY BRAKES FOR ME IN CASE I DON'T OR WILL INCREASE BRAKE FORCE TO AVOID A COLLISION IN CASE I DIDN'T. THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST SELLING POINTS OF THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM: FRONTAL COLLISION AVOIDANCE. THAT DAY ON A BUSY HIGHWAY, DURING RUSH HOUR, I WAS NOTICING SOME SPONGE EFFECT IN THE BRAKE PEDAL SO I DECIDED TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. SUDDENLY, THE BRAKE PEDAL STOPPED RESPONDING TO MY PROPORTIONALITY (CONTROLLED FORCE APPLIED) AND I END UP REAR-ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I WORK TESTING LANDING GEARS FOR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS SO BRAKE FADE WAS NOT NEW TO ME. I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AND REPORTED TO THE DEALER. THE PROBLEM WAS REPRODUCED BY THE DEALER'S TECHNICIAN AND THE CAR WAS INTERNED FOR FURTHER REVISIONS. 2 DAYS LATER, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LACK OF SERVICE IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THE SERVICE WAS DONE IN ANOTHER DEALER ON TIME. THAT WAS THE LAST EXCUSE I HEARD FROM SUBARU. CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THAT THEY WILL NOT REPLACE ANY PART IN THE CAR IF A DEALER DOESN'T APPROVE IT, SO I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SAME DEALER WHERE THE 20,000KM SERVICE WAS DONE, 1 HOUR AWAY FROM MY TOWN. BY THAT TIME, THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER FROM SUMMER 33C TO AUTUMN 17C. THE DEALER PUT MORE THAN 20KM ON THE CAR JUST TO TELL ME THAT HE COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE FAILURE SO THERE'S NO FAILURE AT ALL. I EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT THE FAILURE CANNOT BE REPRODUCED AT 17C TEMPERATURE. I EVEN SHOW HIM THAT THE BRAKE FORCE IS SO WEAK, IT NEVER ACTIVATES THE ABS SYSTEM, BUT ALSO IN VAIN. SUBARU CANT EXPLAIN WHY AN EYESIGHT EQUIPPED CAR ENDS UP REAR-ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF IT, IN BUSY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T ANSWER ME ANYMORE.",

MY VEHICLE PASSED BOTH TESTS AT 1,200 MILES, BUT ROUTINELY IS LOW ON OIL WELL BEFORE MY NEXT SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE.    I HAVE FILED 2 COMPLAINTS WITH SUBARU OF AMERICA WITH NO SUCCESS.

THE SPEED I NOTED IS A GUESS, BUT THE CAR HAD TO CLIMB A HEIGHT OF PERHAPS 8 FEET IN A 20 FOOT DISTANCE!  VERY FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO INJURIES, BUT, MY \"LANDING SPOT\" WAS 20 FEET IN FRONT OF THE CAR GASSING UP IN THE SPOT I HAD JUST LEFT, ADJACENT TO 6 DOUBLE ROWS OF GAS PUMPS!   HAD I SELECTED  1 OR 2 PARKING SPOTS ADJACENT, MY CAR WOULD HAVE CRASHED INTO THEM ALL!   I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR TO HICKSVILLE NY SUBURU THIS AM AND THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH THE CAR, OTHER THAN TO REATTACH THE SHROUD. I AND THEY HAVE NO EXPLANATION, OTHER THAN POSSIBLY THE DRIVER FLOOR MAT, WHICH HAD A RECALL BUT APPEARS TO BE IN ITS PROPER PLACE, AND I HAVE PICTURES OF SAME WHICH I TOOK UPON RETIRING HOME AFTER THE INCIDENT.",

OFF MY FLUIDS AND ALONG I WENT.  SADLY, AFTER HAVING MY 3,000 MILE OIL CHANGE, I CONTINUED TO HAVE ISSUES WITH OIL CONSUMPTION.  I THINK I PAID A VISIT TO THE OIL TECHNICIANS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY 6 WEEKS OR SO; SO MUCH SO THAT THE OIL TECHNICIANS WERE TIRED OF SEEING MY VEHICLE.  I PRACTICALLY DEVELOPED A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OIL TECHNICIANS.  IF THEY DID NOT KNOW ME BY NAME, THEY WERE AT LEAST FAMILIAR WITH MY VEHICLE.  TO MAKE A LONG STORY LONGER, THIS MONTH (SEPTEMBER) OR BETTER STATED LESS THAN A YEAR OF HAVING A 2014 IN MY POSSESSION, WHILE STILL BEING IN THE YEAR 2014 WITH 3 MONTHS LEFT TO GO IN THIS YEAR, I HAD SOME MAJOR WORK DONE TO MY VEHICLE.  UP TO AND INCLUDING A REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE.  PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED INVOICE TO SEE ALL THE ITEMS THAT WERE REPLACED.    NOW YOU ARE PROBLEM ASKING WELL HOW MANY MILES ARE ON THE CAR?  THERE ARE ONLY 7,600 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  IN OTHER WORDS I PUT MAYBE 760 MILES ON MY VEHICLE PER MONTH IN LESS THAN A YEAR.OPPORTUNITY:  CLEARLY, I WAS SOLD A HIGH PRICED LEMON; A DUD.  IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ON CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, IT IS IN MY OPINION THAT SUBARU SHOULD PROVIDE ME WITH A 2014 SUBARU FORESTER THAT IS NOT DEFECTIVE OR ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE DESIGN FLAWS.  NO VEHICLE WITH LESS THAN 8,000 MILES AND LESS THAN A YEAR OLD SHOULD REQUIRE AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT.  PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT AFTER THE WORK WAS DONE NOW THE CAR HAS A VIBRATION AND FEELS AS IF IT IS GOING TO SHUT OFF.   *TR",

AT THE TOP OF THE HILL AT NO MORE THAN 5-10 MPH I TURNED FAIRLY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT TO ENTER THE PARKING SPACE.  AT THAT POINT THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND SURGED FORWARD.  THE VEHICLE HIT A TREE APPROXIMATELY 15-20 FEET AWAY.  THE FORCE OF THE CRASH CAUSED THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY AND THE FRONT END RECEIVED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE RESULTING IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF THE VEHICLE. I'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER 30 YEARS WITH NO ACCIDENTS AND CONSIDER MYSELF AN EXCELLENT DRIVER.  OF COURSE I QUESTIONED WHETHER OR NOT I COULD HAVE HIT THE GAS BY MISTAKE, BUT THIS VISIT IS SO ROUTINE AND HAVE MADE THIS SAME TURN INTO THE PARKING SPACE SO MANY TIMES, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE.  IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE SURGED FORWARD AND HIT THE TREE WITH THAT MUCH FORCE IN SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE.  LUCKILY THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED AS I WAS ALONE IN THE VEHICLE.  I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW MUCH WORSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN.  I DID REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE SUBARU DEALER AND WILL BE MAKING A REPORT TO THE MANUFACTURER SUBARU OF AMERICA.  *TR",

I LOVE THE VEHICLE EXCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CLIMATE CONTROL DIALS WHICH I CONSIDER TO BE A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AT A GLANCE WHAT THE CURRENT SETTING IS FOR EACH FUNCTION (HEAT/AC TEMP, FAN SPEED, FAN DIRECTION.)  STARING AT THE DIAL(S) OR REPEATED GLANCES TAKES THE DRIVER'S ATTENTION OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG, AND THEREFORE IS ABSOLUTELY A SAFETY ISSUE:  EACH ROUND DIAL HAS A RUBBER GRIP SURFACE THAT THE USER CONTACTS. ON THE FRONT FACE OF THE DIAL IS A SHINY CHROME BEZEL RING.  THIS RING IS QUITE NARROW AND HAS 7 SMALL, EQUIDISTANT INDENTATIONS AROUND THE RADIUS. ONE OF THE INDENTATIONS IS YELLOW PLASTIC, WHICH INDICATES THE SETTING.  AT A GLANCE, THE SMALL YELLOW PLASTIC INDICATOR IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE AMONG THE OTHER SIX INDENTATIONS.  WHAT THE PURPOSE IS OF THE INDENTATIONS IS A MYSTERY (SOME MARKETER WANTED SPARKLE?) AND WHY SUBARU CHOSE PALE YELLOW AGAINST SHINY CHROME MAKES NO SENSE.  I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ALTERED MY DIALS BY PUTTING A TINY DROP OF WHITE FINGERNAIL POLISH ON THE BLACK RUBBER GRIP DIRECTLY ABOVE EACH YELLOW PLASTIC INDICATOR. NOW, AT A QUICK GLANCE, I CAN EASILY SEE AT WHAT POSITION EACH FUNCTION DIAL IS SET.  IT'S GREAT.  I FEEL MUCH SAFER.  I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SMALL, UNIMPORTANT PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS A HUGE CONCERN TO ME.  I HOPE NO FORESTER OWNER IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH BECAUSE HE/SHE TOOK HIS/HER EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ONE OR MORE OF THE CLIMATE CONTROL SETTINGS.  THE FORESTER MIGHT BE A \"TOP SAFETY PICK\" BUT NOT ON THIS. THANK YOU.  *TR",

IN COLD WEATHER & AFTER THE ENGINE WARMS UP (DASH BLUE LIGHT TURNS OFF) & WHILE CITY DRIVING, THE ENGINE RPM GOES UP 300 TO 400 RPMS WHEN THE CLIMATE CONTROL (HEATER) IS TURNED ON. THEN IF I STOP FOR A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR A STOP SIGN OR ADJUST THE HEATER FAN SPEED, THE ENGINE RPMS WILL GO UP ANOTHER 500 TO 600 RPMS WITH THE CV TRANSMISSION GOING INTO A LOWER RANGE (TRANSMISSION WHINES QUITE LOUD AT THIS TIME).  I AM NOW DRIVING WITH THE ENGINE RPM AT 1000+ OVER NORMAL RPMS (NORMAL RPMS IS CONSIDERED THE RPM WITH THE CLIMATE CONTROL OFF). THIS CONDITION WILL CONTINUE FOR CLOSE ABOUT 20 MINUTES OF CONTINUED DRIVING AND THEN STOP. IF I TURN OFF THE HEATER WHILE DRIVING THE RPMS REVERT TO NORMAL. IF I AGAIN TURN ON THE HEATER, THE RPMS AGAIN WILL  GO UP 300 TO 400 RPMS AND NOT GO UP THE ADDITIONAL 500 TO 600 RPMS UNTIL I WOULD STOP AGAIN. THE 1000 RPM PLUS CONDITION APPEARS TO BE DANGEROUS ON SLIPPERY ROADS.  *TR",
