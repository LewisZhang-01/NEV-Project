AT THE END, I PAY FOR THE PADS AND THE WARRANTY PAY FOR THE DISK REPAIR AND INSTALLATION.    - SECOND, I HAD AN EXPERIENCE IN A SUDDEN STOP THAT THE ABS SYSTEM DID NOT RESPOND PROPERLY AND MY CAR SLIDE THROUGH THE PAVEMENT UNTIL STOP. FORTUNATELY I HAD ENOUGH SPACE TO STOP WITHOUT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.

SO I JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR TO UNPLUG THE CORD, NOT REALIZING THAT I NEVER PRESSED THE 'P' BUTTON TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK. I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TO PRESS THE 'P' BUTTON TO INITIATE PARK BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD NO MOTION. ANYWAY, I QUICKLY UNPLUGGED THE CHARGER, AND IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, THE CAR STARTED MOVING IN REVERSE, WHICH WAS THE LAST COMMAND THAT I HAD PLACED IT IN.  IN SHOCK, I RAN AROUND TO THE BACK OF THE CAR WITHOUT SHUTTING THE ELECTRIC RECEPTACLE DOOR AND WAS NEARLY RUN OVER BY THE VEHICLE WHILE TRYING TO STOP IT FROM ROLLING OUT OF MY GARAGE. LUCKILY, I MOVED OUT OF THE WAY QUICKLY ENOUGH, BACK AROUND THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR, HOPPED INTO MY SEAT, AND HIT THE 'P' BUTTON TO PARK THE CAR.  HOWEVER, BEFORE THE CAR CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP, THE ELECTRIC RECEPTACLE DOOR I LEFT OPEN IN MY HASTE WAS HEAVILY DAMAGED BY THE VEHICLE REVERSING INTO THE SIDE OF MY GARAGE DOOR OPENING. OVERALL, THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT I FEEL WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN A CONVENTIONAL VEHICLE BECAUSE, IN A CONVENTIONAL VEHICLE, THE DRIVER, UPON REMOVING HIS OR HER FOOT FROM THE BRAKE, WOULD IMMEDIATELY NOTICE IF THE VEHICLE WAS ACTUALLY IN PARK OR REVERSE. IN CONTRAST, THE PHEV WAS IN A STANDBY STATE, WHICH APPEARED THE SAME AS PARK, THEREBY SIMULATING THE PERCEPTION OF BEING IN PARK EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY WAS UNDER THE LAST COMMAND OF REVERSE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS INCIDENT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT VEHICLE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE, NOT TO MENTION A HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE 2018 MITSUBISHI OUTLANDER PHEV BE PROGRAMMED TO SHIFT TO PARK AUTOMATICALLY IF THE CHARGE CORD IS STILL PLUGGED IN.",
