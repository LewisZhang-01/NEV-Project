The force of the braking was enough to cause a bruise from the seatbelt.  The risk is potential loss of control of the car, especially if this occurred at a higher speed, or being rear ended.  We immediately took the car to an Audi dealer who could not ID an issue from looking at fault codes.  We have been experiencing other bogus warning messages: light system warning (nothing wrong), engine RPM exceeded warnings (engine RPMs never close to being exceeded), phone SOS errors.  NO warnings or symptoms regarding the brake system.  Dealer says to monitor.  We have been driving the car for about a week since, and have not experienced the same issue again.",

        "summary": "The 2nd generation Audi Q5 (roughly 2017-2021+) has a major susceptibility to immediate, catastrophic failure as evidenced from my own experience and dozens of episodes reported online. This failure typically causes a $2000-$3000 repair bill that Audi will not cover and will claim is the fault of the owner.  My wife was driving the vehicle with our 5-year-old daughter in the car In the middle of the rear seat. The daughter spilled part of a 500 ml water bottle onto the seat next to her. Within 20 seconds of this happening, the car began alerting about steering malfunctions, braking malfunctions, and the windows began seizing up and down repeatedly. The car was completely inoperable. We are lucky this was on a slow city street and not on the interstate or tollway! Once stopped, we no buttons generated any actions from the vehicle. we couldn't power it on, put it into neutral to be towed away, raise the windows, or perform ANY other function at all. The car was a useless brick. We were charged $125 for the towing service and another $2200 from Audi Plano in Texas. After countless conversations, even debates, with David (director Audi Plano) and even Audi USA customer experience team, they REFUSED to admit any fault in a poor design and help cover any of the costs whatsoever, and we are even still in warranty. The part that was damaged is DIRECTLY below the cupholders and has no effective liquid protections - what did they think would happen!

This is particularly the case given the absence of any mention or warning in the manual about avoiding spillage, and more pertinent to liability, Audi\u2019s failure to anticipate the considerable risk of harm stemming from a readily foreseeable occurrence, ie, spillage.

YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING FORWARD AT 35-40 MPH ON A MAIN STREET WITH THE CLOSEST ONCOMING CAR 1 BLOCK AWAY MY CAR SLAMMED TO A DEAD, WALL SLAMMING STOP. IF A CAR HAD BEEN BEHIND ME THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT. I EMPHASIZE: THIS WAS A DEAD, NO SLOW-DOWN STOP. I REFUSED TO DRIVE IT 50 MILES TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER HAS PICKED IT UP AND TOLD ME THE SENSORS WERE SET TOO SENSITIVE. IF SO, WHY DID THIS NOT OCCUR EVERY TIME I DROVE? FRANKLY, I AM AFRAID I WILL BE FORCED TO DRIVE THIS CAR FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS UNTIL MY LEASE EXPIRES. THE DEALER WILL NOT GIVE ME A LOANER. I THINK THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE CAR. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE WAY THIS IS BEING HANDLED.  FOR YOUR INTEREST, I WAS GIVEN A RIDE TODAY IN THE 2019 SEDAN MODEL. UNBELIEVABLY IT SLAMMED TO A STOP WHILE BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY.",

THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO TURN OFF THE BEEPING AND KEEP THE BACKUP CAMERA ON.  SERVICE CENTERS HAVE CONFIRMED THIS.    THE MAIN SCENARIO WHERE THIS IS A PROBLEM IS WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING CONNECTED TO A HITCH, SUCH AS A BIKE RACK THAT MAY CAUSE THE CAR TO THINK THAT THERE'S AN OBJECT DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE VEHICLE.  THESE BACKUP SENSORS ARE UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A HITCH-BASED MOUNT (WITHOUT POWER CONNECTED) AND SOMETHING THAT IS LEGITIMATELY TOO CLOSE WHILE REVERSING.  WHEN POWER IS CONNECTED, SUCH AS WITH AN ACTUAL TRAILER TO SUPPLY POWER TO BRAKE LIGHTS, THE OWNER'S MANUAL STATES THAT THE BACKUP WARNINGS WILL BE DISABLED AUTOMATICALLY.  BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE A HITCH-BASED BIKE RACK IS ATTACHED THAT DOESN'T NEED POWER, THE WARNING ALARM SOUNDS CONTINUOUSLY WHILE BACKING UP.  THIS IS ANNOYING, AND FOR PASSENGERS IN THE BACK IS ACTUALLY EXTREMELY LOUD.  TURNING OFF THE ALARM DISABLES THE CAMERA AS WELL, WHICH IS....LESS THAN IDEAL AT LEAST.

I WAS DRIVING ON SE 20TH ST., SAMMAMISH, WA AT ABOUT 30 MILES/HR. THERE WAS NO ROCK TO CAUSE THE EXPLOSION. THANKFULLY, MY SON WAS FACING HIS SISTER, TALKING TO HER, WHEN THE EXPLOSION  OCCURRED. OTHERWISE, THE GLASS MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN INTO HIS EYES. MY KIDS WERE EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED BY THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, AND I HAD TO CONSOLE AND REASSURE THEM. I WAS FRIGHTED BUT RELIEVED THEY WERE NOT INJURED.    I WENT TO AUDI BELLEVUE AND TOLD THEM THE WINDOW EXPLODED BY ITSELF. THEY SUGGESTED ME LEAVE THE CAR WITH THEM. THEY CALLED THE NEXT DAY TO SAY THE AUDI FACTORY DECLINED TO COVER THE COST. THEY TOLD ME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE TO CAUSE THE EXPLOSION, WHICH IS NOT THE TRUTH. THE WINDOW EXPLOSION SCRATCHED THE PAINT OFF THE REAR DOOR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. I FILED A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND HAD AUDI FIX THE WINDOW. I PAID FOR THE $500 DEDUCTIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN WITH THE WINDOW REPLACED, I DON'T FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE MY KIDS IN THE CAR. FURTHERMORE, MY KIDS WORRY ANOTHER WINDOW MIGHT EXPLODE ON THEM. THERE WAS NO SAFETY CHECK PERFORMED FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT ON THE OTHER WINDOWS.    ON MAY 7, I WENT TO GERBER COLLISION AND GLASS IN BELLEVUE FOR AN ESTIMATE ON THE BODY DAMAGE. THE COST IS ESTIMATED AT $1800.     THE PROBABILITY IS THAT AUDI HAS DEFECTIVE WINDOWS AND THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS.  IT WAS A VERY FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE AND DANGEROUS.
