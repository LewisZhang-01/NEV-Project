WHEN I SLAMMED ON MY BRAKES, MY FRONT BRAKES WERE OUT, ALMOST CAUSING ME TO REAR-END THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I TOOK THE BIKE TO THE VICTORY DEALER TO FIND OUT THE ABS BRAKE LINES UNDER THE TANK HAD BEEN RUBBED COMPLETELY THROUGH BY A HOSE CLAMP THAT WAS INSTALLED FROM THE FACTORY. POLARIS CLAIMS THAT THE CLAMP WAS INSTALLED INCORRECTLY BY SOMEONE ELSE, BUT THE CLAMP HAS NEVER BEEN TOUCHED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE FACTORY. I LOOKED IN THE MANUAL, AND THERE ARE NO INCORRECT, OR CORRECT WAYS TO INSTALL THE CLAMP TO BEGIN WITH. THE VICTORY DEALER REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKE LINE ASSEMBLE AT A COST OF $854.00, AND REMOVED THE STOCK HOSE CLAMPS TO AVOID THIS HAPPENING AGAIN. THEY USED PLASTIC ZIP-TIES INSTEAD. THE HOSE CLAMPS HOLD THE FUEL VENT, AND DRAIN LINES UNDER THE GAS TANK. THIS IS A HORRIBLE DESIGN, AND PLACEMENT OF THE BRAKE LINE. IMO THIS WILL HAPPEN TO SOMEONE AND THEY WILL HAVE A BAD ACCIDENT, AS I ALMOST DID.",
