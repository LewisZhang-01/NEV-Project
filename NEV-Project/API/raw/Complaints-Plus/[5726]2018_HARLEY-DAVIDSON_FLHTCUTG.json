I was at a red light and when the light turned green I started in 1st gear and stalled the bike in the middle of the intersection. Normally Harley\u2019s will start in gear so I tried but it wouldn\u2019t. I had to turn off the bike, put it in neutral and start it.   Harley issued a Service Bulletin, see attached, however unless the bike is under warranty they won\u2019t fix it. This should be a recall as it\u2019s very dangerous.  I just purchased the bike and the previous owner had no idea. Please help fix this. Thanks",
