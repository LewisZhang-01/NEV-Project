The actuator assembly, and brake booster pump assembly w/ accumulator have failed. Part # 04008-26448 and 04008-51148   How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk?  This controls the brakes and anti-lock brake system. Stopping distance and anti-lock performance has been very erratic. Brake pedal feel has been soft or overly-firm and could easily cause a collision or serious accident. This is a serious and known safety issue and should result in a vehicle recall.   Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? This problem was confirmed by Norm Reeves Toyota San Diego on 3/12/22, and has been acknowledged by Toyota in Bulletin POL 19-06.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? There are many warning lamps on in the car, including an ABS and Brake System warning on the display, the traction control light, ABS light, warning light, and parking brake light.  The vehicles brake booster has been running frequently and making a loud noise for about 18 months or 2 years prior to failure and prior to warning lights coming on.",

WENT TO A TOYOTA DEALER ABOUT 10 MILES AWAY AND THEY SAID IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY A ROCK. I SAID NO ONE WAS NEAR US, FRONT OR BACK, AND THEY SAID WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHIP IN THE SUN ROOF GLASS FROM BEFORE THIS HAPPENED. IT WAS A NICE DAY, NO RAIN, NOT TOO HOT, AROUND 65 DEGREES, COMFORTABLE, SUN WAS OUT.  THEY TAPED THE GLASS THAT WAS STILL TOGETHER SO WE COULD DRIVE HOME AND HAVE IT REPAIRED. THEY DID NOT HAVE THE GLASS AND WOULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS. THIS HAPPENED IN JULY, 2012.",

THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING SO HIGH THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT FROM MOVING.  I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL, CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP, AND WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WAS IN NEUTRAL, TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO NORMAL IDLE.  THIS SAME SEQUENCE HAPPENED BOTH TIMES.    THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE THIS MONTH, BUT THESE ARE THE FIRST OCCURRENCES SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER, AND THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THAT IF THE VEHICLE ISN'T DEMONSTRATING THAT BEHAVIOR WHEN I BRING IT IN, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND WHAT CAUSED IT.  THEY INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE DATA RECORDER WOULD NOT RECORD SUCH AN EVENT.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD ADD A NOTE ABOUT THIS TO THE RECORD THEY HAVE ON THIS VEHICLE (THEY HAVE DONE ALL THE SERVICE SINCE I PURCHASED IT FROM THEM).    I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED THAT SHOULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN, I WILL TRADE THE VEHICLE.  I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO KEEP MY HAND ON THE GEARSHIFT, READY TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL.

THIS MALFUNCTION TRIPS A WARNING IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM, AND AFFECTS OPERABILITY OF THE BRAKES.    RECENTLY ON JUNE 18, 2012 WHILE DRIVING ON A LOCAL STREET AT 25 MPH, A VEHICLE PASSED A STOP SIGN CROSSING IN FRONT OF ME NECESSITATING I BRAKE HARD TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.   WHILE AN ACCIDENT WAS AVOIDED, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS A BRAKE MALFUNCTION WARNING CAME ON, AND THE BRAKE SYSTEM STOPPED OPERATING NORMALLY.   THE DEALER FOUND THAT DUE TO THE HARD BRAKING, THE BRAKE PEDAL BECAME MISALIGNED, AND THE BRAKE LOAD SENSOR FAILED AGAIN.  THIS PATTERN LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IN INSTANCES OF HARD BRAKING, DAMAGE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL AND/OR LOAD SENSOR CAN OCCUR, CAUSING A LOSS OF BRAKE POWER POSSIBLY RESULTING IN AN ACCIDENT.  *TR",

        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 2, 2009, I TOOK DELIVERY OF A NEW 2010 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER SPORT MODEL, WITH A V-6 ENGINE AND 2 WHEEL DRIVE. THIS VEHICLE SUBSEQUENTLY WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE JANUARY & FEBRUARY, 2010 RECALL NOTICES AS BEING ONE OF THE VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THE STICKING GAS PEDAL PROBLEM.    HOWEVER, PRECEDING THE RECALL NOTICES, ON JANUARY 15, 2010, I EXPERIENCED A BRAKE PEDAL FADE WHILE STOPPED ON LEVEL FLAT GROUND AT A RED TRAFFIC SIGNAL. I PRESSED DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL HARDER TO ENSURE THAT I DID NOT DRIFT INTO THE REAR END OF THE CAR STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME. UPON PRESSING DOWN HARDER ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE \"HILL ASSIST\" WARNING BUZZER SOUNDED EVEN THOUGH MY WHEELS WERE NOT SPINNING OR IN DANGER OF SPINNING. WHEN THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL CHANGED TO GREEN A MINUTE OR SO LATER, I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL AND LIGHTLY DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO START MOVING FORWARD. I FOUND THAT I HAD TO APPLY SUBSTANTIAL ( GREATER THAN NORMAL) PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE FORWARD. THIS CAUSED GREAT CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING FORWARD TOO QUICKLY FROM A DEAD STOP AND HITTING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.    I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY SELLING DEALER THE FOLLOWING DAY TO HAVE THE VEHICLE CHECKED OUT. I WAS ADVISED THAT THE CAR'S COMPUTER DID NOT SHOW ANY DEFAULTS AND THAT ALL SYMPTOMS WERE NORMAL. I WAS FURTHER ADVISED TO STOP PRESSING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL SO HARD. HOWEVER, MY CONCERN IS THAT WHENEVER THE \"HILL ASSIST\" SYSTEM IS ENGAGED (I CAN ENGAGE IT AT ANY TIME AT WILL), THERE IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT THE EXTRA PRESSURE NEEDED TO START THE CAR MOVING FORWARD WILL CAUSE ME TO ACCELERATE INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.     I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS CONDITION IS COMPUTER RELATED AND PRESENTS AN IMMINENT DANGER TO BOTH MYSELF AND OTHER MOTORISTS DRIVING A SIMILAR EQUIPPED TOYOTA HIGHLANDER    THEREFORE, I AM REQUESTING THAT AN INVESTIGATION BE COMMENCED IMMEDIATELY IN LIGHT OF TOYOTA'S MASSIVE RECALL PROBLEMS.
