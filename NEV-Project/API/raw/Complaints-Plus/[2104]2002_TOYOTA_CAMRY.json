BECAUSE IT WAS CERTIFIED USED I ASSUMED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT IT HAD ALL OF ITS PARTS AND THEY OPERATED PROPERLY.    I HAVE DRIVEN THE VEHICLE FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS WITHOUT ANY MAJOR ISSUES.  ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO AGO, THE AIRBAG LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND STAY ON IN THE VEHICLE WHEN THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE GOT HOT BUT I DID NOT TAKE IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT THAT TIME.  UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BOB HOWARD TOYOTA IN EDMOND, OKLAHOMA TO REPLACE THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR HANDLE (WHICH WAS MY THIRD TIME REPLACING IT) DURING THIS TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE TECHNICIAN CHECK OUT THE AIRBAG LIGHT ALSO.  AFTER THE TECHNICIAN CONDUCTED THEIR REVIEW THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE A PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG.  THEY INSTALLED RESISTORS TO KEEP THE AIRBAG LIGHT FROM COMING ON TO WARNING ME ABOUT THE ISSUE.  THIS GAVE ME A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BY INTENTIONALLY FALSIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO EARN A PROFIT, THEREFORE ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS.  IF THE LIGHT WOULD HAVE COME ON BEFORE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE I WOULD HAVE ASKED ABOUT IT BUT IT DID NOT.   IF THEY SELL A CERTIFIED USED VEHICLE AND THEY MENTION THAT IT HAS DUAL-SIDE AIRBAGS, THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE COMPANY LYING TO THEM ABOUT IT.  I HAVE DRIVEN THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS WITH THE ASSUMPTION I HAD DUAL AIRBAGS IN MY VEHICLE TO RECENTLY FIND OUT THAT I BEEN LIED TO FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS.  NOW, I AM BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR A DEFECT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED DURING THE CERTIFICATION OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS UNFAIR HAVE THE CUSTOMER PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSES MISTAKE.  THEY ARE NOW REFUSING TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE.    *TR",

ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR WOULD SOMETIMES HESITATE. STALLING OCCURRED MOSTLY WHEN STOPPING AT A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT AFTER COMING OFF A HIGHWAY. THE CAR WOULD START AGAIN, AND THEN STALL REPEATEDLY AT EVERY RED LIGHT OR OTHER EVENT THAT INVOLVED SLOWING DOWN OR STOPPING.  AFTER ENDURING THE STALLING PROBLEM FOR MANY MONTHS, ON 6/19/09 WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR MECHANIC. THEY SAID THE STALLING MIGHT BE CAUSED BY A STICKING VALVE OR THE IDLE CONTROL MOTOR, BUT THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC AGAIN 8/20/09 AND THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY, WHICH SEEMED TO HELP.  BY SPRING 2010 THE PROBLEM WAS BACK. WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC 5/21/10 AND THIS TIME THEY CLEANED OUT EGR ASSEMBLY AND CHECKED ALL VACUUM LINES. CAR STILL STALLED SO 6/26/10 WE TOOK IT TO TOYOTA DEALER. DEALER WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE STALLING PROBLEM AND SAID THAT NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED, WE SHOULD BRING IT DIRECTLY TO THEIR SERVICE CENTER.  ON 7/20/10, OUR SON WAS DRIVING THE CAMRY. AS BEFORE, WHEN HE WAS DRIVING AT A HIGHER, STEADIER SPEED, THE CAR WAS OK. WHEN HE SLOWED DOWN TO PARK IN A PARKING GARAGE, THE STALLING PROBLEM RECURRED.

I PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDAL TWICE TO SEE IF IT WAS STUCK SINCE I'D HEARD NEWS REPORTS THAT THIS WAS REPORTEDLY THE ISSUE ACCORDING TO TOYOTA WHEN OTHER INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED, BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE WITH THE NEWER MODELS. NONETHELESS, WHEN I RELEASED THE PEDAL, THE GAGE CONTINUED SURGING. THANK GOODNESS I WAS IN NEUTRAL WHEN THE ACCELERATION STARTED BECAUSE THERE WERE CHILDREN IN THE AREA WHO WERE WAITING TO CATCH THEIR SCHOOL BUS. I DECIDED TO TURN OFF MY VEHICLE AND SAT FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS, STARTED IT BACK UP AND IT WAS STILL SURGING FOR APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER THREE SECONDS, THEN FINALLY STOPPED AND WENT BACK TO NORMAL. AT THAT POINT, I TURNED BACK AROUND AND PARKED THE CAR AT MY HOME.  FORTUNATELY, I HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE. THAT FOLLOWING TUESDAY I STOPPED AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN KANSAS CITY, KANSAS AND EXPLAINED TO THE SERVICE PARTS WORKER WHAT HAPPENED. HIS EXPLANATION WAS IT'S THE FLOOR MAT GETTING STUCK CAUSING THE ACCELERATION AND THAT I NEED TO PROVIDE MY VIN NUMBER FOR THEM TO LOOK IT UP.  FIRST OF ALL, THIS WAS NOT A FLOOR MAT ISSUE. IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN WHEN I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, IT SHOULD'VE COME UNSTUCK.  IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE DEALERSHIP WANTED TO GO THE ROUTE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO THE PROBLEM. UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, I CAME ACROSS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN MEMO FROM AUGUST  2002 THAT ADDRESSED THE ACCELERATION ISSUE STATING THAT IT WAS AN ELECTRONICS GLITCH. I E-MAILED TOYOTA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. AND THE ONLY RESOLUTION THEY OFFERED WAS.....NOTHING.  APPARENTLY THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY REPAIRS DONE. DUE TO THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF THESE INCIDENTS, REPAIRS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC AND NOT AT THE COST OF THE CONSUMER!  *TR",

THE ECU WAS REPLACED, AND I WAS ASSURED THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN RESOLVED.  THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT COST ME SEVERAL SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, AND IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT IT DID NOT RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT, INJURY, OR WORSE.  ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 30-35 MPH WHEN ONCE AGAIN THE ACCELERATOR WOULD NOT RESPOND AND THE CEL LIT UP.  THIS TIME, THE ENGINE DID NOT STALL.

ALL COMPONENTS INDICATED BY THIS CODE WERE CHECKED AND DEEMED OKAY.  AFTER THE DEALER CONTACTED TOYOTA, THE CAR WAS ALSO CHECKED FOR GROUNDING AND VOLTAGE ISSUES.  AGAIN, EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT OKAY. THE DEALERSHIP KEPT AND DROVE THE CAR, TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  IT REMAINS THERE TODAY WHILE WE DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

I CAME TO A STOP AT A RED SIGNAL LIGHT WHEN I SMELLED THE ODOR OF AN ELECTRICAL FIRE.  I STARTED CHECKING THE DASHBOARD FOR ANY WARNING LIGHTS ON, WHICH THERE WERE NONE LIT.  A/C AND HEATER SWITCHES WERE IN THE OFF POSITION.  AS THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I WENT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY.  I STARTED LOOKING AROUND THE INTERIOR TO SEE IF SOMETHING WAS BURNING.  AS I WAS CHECKING THE BACK SEAT, I SAW BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING OUT OF THE REAR BOTTOM OF THE CAR, THINKING THAT IT WAS SOMETHING BURNING IN THE TRUNK.  I USED THE TRUNK LEVER TO OPEN IT, GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND NOTICED THAT NOTHING WAS BURNING THERE, AND WENT BACK TO THE DRIVERS DOOR.  I THEN NOTICED FLAMES COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I REALIZED THAT THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RAN A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY FROM IT.  I DIALED 911 TO REPORT THE FIRE.  I WAS LESS THAN A HALF MILE FROM HOME AND CALLED MY HUSBAND, WHO RESPONDED IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES WITH A LARGE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.  HE DID NOT OPEN THE HOOD, BUT TRIED TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES FROM THE FRONT END, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE FIRE SPREAD RAPIDLY INTO THE FRONT SEAT AREA BEFORE THE FIRE DEPT ARRIVED.  THE CAR WAS A TOTAL LOSS.  THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TOYOTA AS IT WAS IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND SERVICED REGULARLY.  PREVIOUSLY THAT DAY, I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES WITHOUT ANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS.  JUST BEFORE THE FIRE, I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES ON SURFACE STREETS AT 25 MILES PER HOUR.  THE CAR WAS RUNNING JUST FINE, AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF PROBLEMS LIKE A LOSS OF POWER, AND NO WARNING LIGHTS HAD COME ON AT ALL.  I WAS THE SECOND OWNER OF THE CAR.

AFTER RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS, HE DETERMINED THAT THE SENSOR HAD MALFUNCTIONED AND ADVISED ME NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR ANY FURTHER UNTIL IT WAS REPAIRED.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT, FROM MY MECHANIC'S EXPLANATION, THE SENSOR DETERMINES THE POSITION OF THE ACCELERATOR AND SENDS A REQUEST FOR ACCELERATION AS A VOLTAGE RANGING FROM 0-5V, WHERE 0V IS NO ACCELERATION AND 5V IS FULL-THROTTLE.  THROUGH FURTHER TESTING, HE DETERMINED THAT THE SENSOR THAT HAD MALFUNCTIONED WAS READING 5V.  I FIND IT VERY CONCERNING THAT IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE THE SENSOR DOES NOT \"FAIL SAFE\" (I.E. FAIL TO 0V, RATHER THAN 5V).  THE TECHNICIAN EXPLAINED THAT THE SECOND SENSOR WAS THERE AS A SAFETY REDUNDANCY, BUT EITHER WAY, \"FAIL SAFE\" IS ONE OF THE MOST BASIC DESIGN CONCEPTS IN AN APPLICATION WHERE SAFETY IS CRITICAL AS IS THE CASE HERE.

I BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE DATING BACK TO 2002 TOYOTA MODEL CARS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I BELIEVE TOYOTA WAS AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM. LET ME EXPLAIN:    MY MOTHER PURCHASED A NEW 2002 TOYOTA CAMRY IN 2001, AND WITHIN 3-6 MONTHS OF DRIVING THE VEHICLE SHE EXPERIENCED THE UNINTENDED INCREASED ACCELERATION WITH COMPLETE BRAKING FAILURE PROBLEM MORE THAN ONCE. I WAS A PASSENGER ON ONE INCIDENT, SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT, AND THE CAR ACCELERATED ON IT'S OWN FROM 25MPH TO 45 MPH, HAND BRAKE, PEDAL BRAKE ALL FAILED WHEN APPLIED. CAR KEPT MOVING. IF I HAD NOT REACHED ACROSS FROM THE BACK SEAT AND JAMMED THE CAR GEAR FROM DRIVE INTO THE PARK POSITION, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT WITH INJURIES OR WORSE.    MY MOM REFUSED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AFTER THIS INCIDENT ON MAY 21,2002. SHE TRIED TO TRADE IT IN AND GET HER MONEY BACK FROM THE DEALER IN DALLAS/FT.WORTH AREA, BUT THE TOYOTA DEALER REFUSED. SHE HAD TO GO THRU AN OFFICIAL ARBITRATION BOARD HEARING WITH THE EXECUTIVES AT TOYOTA BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND WANTED TO RETURN IT. THE TOYOTA BOARD HEARING OUTCOME WAS NOT IN HER FAVOR. GO FIGURE. BUT ON THE WAY OUT OF THE HEARING THE LEAD TOYOTA MECHANIC TOOK HER ASIDE AND TOLD HER \"OFF\" THE RECORD \"THAT THIS ACCELERATION PROBLEM WAS GOING TO BE A BIG PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE\" AND THAT HE WAS SORRY. THAT SAME WEEK MY MOM TRADED HER NEW 2002 TOYOTA CAMRY IN FOR A NEW HONDA AT THE HONDA DEALER.    MY MOM SINCE HAS PASSED AWAY. ANYWAY, I JUST THOUGHT THAT DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE I WOULD SHARE OUR STORY WITH YOU. IN ADDITION MY SISTERS ACCOMPANIED MY MOM TO HER ARBITRATION HEARING AT TOYOTA IN DALLAS FT WORTH AREA ALONG WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW WHO IS A FORD MECHANIC , AND I AM SURE THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE HEARING EVENTS IF NEEDED. WE THINK FURTHER INVESTIGATION MAY BE WARRANTED. *TR",

MY VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARKING LOT APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET SHORT OF RAMMING THE SIDE OF A PARKED CAR.

I IMMEDIATELY PLACED THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF.  THE LEFT FRONT QUARTER PANEL OF MY CAR RECEIVED MINOR DAMAGE FROM HITTING THE MAIL BOXES.

NEXT, I REMOVED THE HEAD AND SURE ENOUGH, ONE BOLT CAME OUT WITH ALUMINUM IN THE THREAD...THUS INDICATING A STRIPPED BOLT.    MY THEORY: THE PLACEMENT OF THE (INSULATION) FOAM RUBBER PIECE BETWEEN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THE ENGINE BLOCK CREATED AN UNEVEN DISPERSION OF HEAT, CREATING \"METAL FATIGUE\" IN THE ALUMINUM BLOCK ALLOWING THE HEAD BOLT TO STRIP.'

SHE WAS SO AFRAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIT SOMEONE.  LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS BEHIND HER SO NO ONE GOT HURT. SHE TRIED APPLYING THE BRAKES TO NO AVAIL AND THEN TRIED MOVING THE GEARS AND EVENTUALLY THE CAR STOPPED.     2)ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2009, SHE WAS BACKING OUT FROM HER HOME AND THE CAR 'TOOK OFF AND WENT BACK REALLY FAST AND THEN SPUN AROUND AND THEN HIT A TREE ACROSS THE STREET' IN THE NEIGHBOR'S SWELL.  SHE HIT THE BRAKE PEDAL BUT THE CAR DID NOT STOP.  SHE THEN TURNED THE IGNITION OFF AND THE CAR EVENTUALLY STOPPED.    3)ON OCTOBER 6, 2009, SHE WAS BACKING OUT FROM GETTING HER HAIR DONE AND 'THE CAR ACCELERATED, TURNED AROUND AND WENT TOWARDS THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE BACKYARD OF THE HOUSE---HITTING THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE ALONG THE WAY'.  THE CAR WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK.  THE CAR BROKE DOWN THE CLOTHES LINE.   THANK GOD THAT NEITHER SHE, THE PASSENGER , NOR THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE GOT HURT.   THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE WAS UNDER A CAR - FIXING IT IN THE BACKYARD.  HAD HE NOT BEEN UNDER THE CAR, SHE FELT SURE THAT THE CAR WOULD HAVE HIT HIM.      4)ON OCTOBER 27, 2009 SHE WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40 MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE CAR 'JUST TOOK OFF GOING REALLY FAST'.

THE NEXT DAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING AND SHE WAS JUST ABLE TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE MECHANIC'S SHOP WITH THE CAR RUNNING ROUGHLY.  THE MECHANIC ADVISED THAT THE ENGINE (136,000 MILES) HAD SUFFERED A \"BLOWN\" HEAD GASKET.

UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED - TOTAL COST TO PUT IN A REASONABLY \"NEW\" USED ENGINE (FROM A 2009 SCION) WAS $5,800.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND AM NOT UNDULY UPSET THAT THE HEAD GASKET WAS BLOWN HOWEVER, SOMETHING AS BASIC AS KNOWING THAT YOU SHOULD NOT USE STEEL BOLTS IN AN ALUMINUM THREAD SHOULD BE REMEDIED BY TOYOTA.

PRESENTLY THE CAR HAS 64,000 MILES. ON JUNE 26 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN WENT OFF, AFTER THAT THE A/C STOPPED WORKING. WE TOOK THE CAR INTO COGGIN TOYOTA AT THE AVENUES ON JUNE 28 AND WERE GIVEN A BILL OF $1154 WITH AN EXPLANATION THAT THE ENTIRE A/C CONDENSER ASSEMBLY, AIR FLOW SENSOR AND AIR FUEL SENSOR NEEDED REPLACEMENT. OBVIOUSLY WE HAD TO PAY FOR THIS AND HAVE IT DONE AS WE'RE GOING OUT OF TOWN AND HAVE A CHILD WHO RIDES IN THIS CAR REGULARLY, BUT THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS. FOR THIS AGE OF A CAR, AND SUPPOSEDLY BEING THE MOST RELIABLE AND HIGHLY RATED CAR FOR THAT YEAR THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. THIS CAR HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY BAD ACCIDENTS AND IS NOT DRIVEN EXCESSIVELY. ALL ROUTINE MAINTENANCE IS PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS.     THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECT ON TOYOTA'S PART AND NEEDS TO BE COMPENSATED FOR. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY THIS MUCH FOR A REPAIR ON THIS TYPE OF CAR, WHETHER OR NOT THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED. I EXPECTED MUCH MORE FROM TOYOTA THAN WE HAVE PRESENTLY EXPERIENCED AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED.

I CONTACTED TOYOTA CANADA FOR SUPPORT IN THIS MATTER TO ONLY EXPERIENCE MORE DISAPPOINTMENT. AFTER BEING ASSURED THAT A RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST WOULD NOT TAKE LONGER THAN SEVEN TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS, I HAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE ON FEW OCCASIONS, BY E-MAIL AND PHONE, UNTIL FINALLY RECEIVING A RESPONSE AFTER SIX WEEKS ? A NEGATIVE ONE.    MY CURRENT DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT SO MUCH DUE TO THE FACT THAT TOYOTA TOOK SUCH A LONG TIME TO REPLY, BUT TO THE INFLEXIBILITY PROVEN BY THOSE WHO ANALYZED AND ?SOLVED? MY CASE. ALSO, THEY SEEM TO SEND \"CANNED MESSAGES\". BUT, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, HERE ARE THE QUICK FACTS ABOUT MY CAR AS ALSO PRESENTED IN MY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE:    1. THE SOLENOID FAILURE WAS FIRST REPORTED AT 43,000 KM (25,000 MILES) WHEN THE CAR WAS 4 YEARS OLD, WELL UNDER WARRANTY. AT THAT TIME INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, A TRANSMISSION FLUSH WAS PERFORMED AND THE CODE RESET. BUT THE CODE REAPPEARED WHEN THE CAR WAS FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OLD, AND ONLY 67,000 KM (40,000 MILES). JUST 4 MONTHS OUT OF THE OFFICIAL WARRANTY.    2. THE PROBLEM MY CAR HAS IS COMMON FOR TOYOTA CARS. ALTHOUGH THE P0770 CODE I GOT IS A GENERIC CODE, A GOOGLE SEARCH RETURNS ONLY TOYOTA REPORTED ISSUES IN THE FIRST 40 RESULTS. MY CAMRY HAS TRANSMISSION U140E WHICH IS SHARED WITH OTHER TOYOTA CARS. LEXUS RX300 (USING U140E) HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN (1999-2002):  PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE 5 SOLENOIDS USED IN THE U140E/U140F TRANSMISSIONS (NHTSA ITEM NUMBER: 10009396)  THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS TSB FOR SOLENOID PROBLEMS WITH THE FOLLOWING TOYOTA CARS: TUNDRA, HIGHLANDER, MATRIX, CAMRY, LEXUS RX300, SIENNA. THEY SEEMED TO BE PLAGUED BY THIS PROBLEM. EVEN SIENNA 2004 (5 YEARS LATER AFTER THE FIRST TSB IN 1999) STILL HAS THAT PROBLEM.  *JB",

A SHORT TIME LATER THE LEFT FRONT OF MY VEHICLE VIOLENTLY FELL TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE VEHICLES BEHIND ME AND WITH DIFFICULTY I STEERED TO THE CURB.

AFTER CHECKING THE VEHICLE I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE FIREWALL NEAR THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND THAT WATER DAMAGE HAD CAUSED THE ELECTRICAL DAMAGE. FURTHERMORE, THEY (MODESTO TOYOTA) COULD NOT REPAIR THE DAMAGE; WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO AN AUTO BODY SHOP.    WE NEXT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED, MERCED TOYOTA, ON 1/25/06.  THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME, AND WE WERE ALSO INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REGARDING THIS PROBLEM (ALTHOUGH NO ONE EVER OFFERED TO GIVE US A COPY, OR EVEN ALLOW US TO READ IT).

A MECHANIC (NOT AT TOYOTA) ALSO POINTED OUT THE TIRES WERE WEARING UNEVENLY AND VERY QUICKLY (I HAVE PUT FEWER THAN 20,000 TOTAL MILES ON THIS CAR). LAST WEEK I WAS COMING AROUND A CORNER IN THE SNOW (AT ABOUT 10 MPH) HIT A SLIPPERY PATCH AND THE CAR SEIZED UP COMPLETELY. I SLID ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO ANOTHER CAR. NOW LOOKING AT THE NHTSA SITE, I SEE THAT I AM NOT ALONE, AND THAT THE TIRES THAT COME WITH THE CAR FROM THE FACTORY ARE NOT MEANT FOR ALL WEATHER DRIVING. I AM OUTRAGED. LIKE OTHERS I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION AS A \"SAFE\" FAMILY CAR. I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER AT MY DEALER WHO BASICALLY SAID \"TOO BAD. TOYOTA IS NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH TIRES AT THIS TIME.\" HE DID ADMIT, HOWEVER, THAT THE TIRES ON THE CAR ARE CONSIDERED 'HIGH PERFORMANCE' AND ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED IN THE SNOW. GREAT. I TOO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO BUY $500 WORTH OF NEW TIRES TOMORROW. I FEEL TOYOTA SHOULD PAY FOR SOME IF NOT ALL OF THIS. NOT LIKELY. IT IS ALSO NOT LIKELY THAT I WILL EVER BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA.  PEOPLE NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THIS VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. IT COULD EASILY BE LIFE-THREATENING.",

I COULD HEAR THE CAR'S ENGINE ROAR AND A MOMENT LATER FOUND THAT I HAD DRIVEN OVER A CONCRETE CURB, UP A TWO FOOT CONCRETE RETAINING WALL, AND THROUGH A CHAIN-LINK FENCE. I DON'T KNOW HOW A CAR COULD DO THIS!! THE TOTAL SPACE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN WAS ONLY ABOUT 3 LINEAR FEET!! I WAS NOT PUSHING THE ACCELERATOR!! THERE WAS INDEED AN ACCELERATION SURGE IN MY 2002 CAMRY V6. THE CAR STOPPED, STRADDLING THE CONCRETE WALL, THE FRONT DRIVE WHEELS WERE OFF THE GROUND. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND ASKED THE MECHANIC ON-SITE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS ON THE 2002 CAMRY. I SWEAR THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING I SAID BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I DID NOT CAUSE THE ACCIDENT. THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A DEFECT IN THE TOYOTA CAMRY. A TOW TRUCK REMOVED MY VEHICLE FORM THE RETAINING WALL. I THEN DROVE THE CAR DIRECTLY TO THE TITUS-WILL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE AND INDICATED IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. DAMAGE TO THE CAR INCLUDED THE FRONT BUMPER, SEVERAL MAJOR SCRATCHES, AND SEVERAL SMALL DENTS. I EXPLAINED THAT WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY AND ASKED ABOUT RECALLS. THEY INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NONE FOR MY VEHICLE. THEY DID ADMIT AFTER SOME QUESTIONING THAT THEY WOULD NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DEALERSHIPS DO NOT SHARE INFORMATION AND TOYOTA CORPORATE DOES NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE DEALERSHIPS.

MY COMMENT TO THEM WAS CONCERNING THE REAR DOOR, WHICH I HAD NOT USED THAT MUCH AND OVER THE LAST 6 MONTH MAYBE 3 TIME AT THE MOST PER WEEK, CERTAINLY NOT ALOT.  WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME WAS THAT THE DOOR HANDLE MECHANISM IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND SO IS THE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE. MY CONCERN AS A CONSUMER THAT TOYOTA DID NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE TO USE A PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE AND MECHANISM AND GIVEN THAT THINGS BREAK SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF 300.00 TO REPLACE.  I CONTEND THAT METAL PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF THE HANDLES.

BOTH TIMES I HAD BEEN USING THE CRUSE CONTROL, DISENGAGED IT BY APPLYING THE BRAKE AND AS THE CAR SLOWED DOWN REAPPLICATION OF THE BRAKE CAUSED THE CAR TO SPEED UP.

NO PERSONAL INJURIES WERE INVOLVED.  AFTER THE FIRST OCCURANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS MY MISTAKE, I APPLIED THE ACCELERATOR WHEN I MEANT TO APPLY THE BRAKE.  THE SECOND TIME I FELT IT WAS PROBABLY A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR, AND WOULD BRING IT UP WITH TOYOTA NEXT TIME I BROUGHT THE CAR IN.  THE THIRD TIME I WAS SURE THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM FOR TOYOTA AND I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE TOYOTA DEALER.  THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAID NEITHER THEY OR THE DISTRICT OFFICE HAD HEARD OF A SIMILAR PROBLEM BEFORE.

I SLAMMED THE SHIFTER INTO PARK.THE CAR STOPPED MOVING BUT THE ENGINE WENT TO REDLINE, I TURNED THE CAR OFF.I CHECKED WHICH PEDAL MY FOOT WAS ON AND IT WAS STILL PRESSED FIRMLY ON THE BRAKES.  I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON,THE CAR BEHAVED NORMALLY. I THINK WHEN SHIFTING OUT OF PARK THE DRIVE-BY-WIRE COMPUTER IS MALFUNTIONING. RECALL THEM BEFORE SOMEONE DIES AND OR GETS HURT. I THINK TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND HOW TO FIX IT. I PITY THE PERSON WHO RENTS A CAMRY AN IS UNAWARE OF THE DEFECT AND DOESN'T HAVE THERE FOOT READY ON THE BRAKE AND PREPARED TO SHUT OF THE IGNITION SAFELY.        *AK",

IT STILL SMELLS! #3 - MY HUSBAND TOOK THE CAR TO WAL-MART TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND THE TIRES BALANCED AND ROTATED BECAUSE WE NOTICED ALOT OF WEAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRES AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VIBRATING WHEN DRIVING.  MY HUSBAND WAS PAGED BACK TO THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTION BY AN EMPLOYEE TO SEE THE TIRES HIMSELF BEFORE THEY TOOK THEM ALL OFF THE CAR AND TO WARN MY HUSBAND ABOUT DRIVING ON THE TIRES IF WE DIDN'T REPLACE THEM IMMEDIATELY.  MY HUSBAND SAID THE INSIDE OF THE TIRES WERE SHOWING THE WIRES FROM SEVERE WEARING.  MY HUSBAND TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE WE PURCHASED IT TO HAVE THEM INSPECT THE FRONT END FOR DAMAGE THAT COULD CAUSE THE TIRES TO WEAR IN SUCH A WAY SO QUICKLY.  OUR VEHICLE IS 1 YR. OLD WITH 30,000 MILES ON IT.  HE WAS TOLD IT WAS OK, BUT THE TIRES ON THE CAR AT TIME OF PURCHASE WEREN'T MEANT TO LAST VERY LONG, ANYWAY.  HE TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL - TRUSTED - TIRE COMPANY AND HAD THE TIRES REPLACED.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR DEALER ISN'T AWARE OF ANY RECALLS AND/OR COMPLAINTS ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES, BUT AFTER RESEARCHING THE INTERNET, I HAVE COME ACROSS MORE THAN ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO MAKE ME WONDER IF I'VE MADE A HUGE/COSTLY MISTAKE IN TRUSTING THE TOYOTA NAME AND PAST REPUTATION, ESPECIALLY WITH 3 CHILDREN WHO WERE PUT AT RISK AND A MONTHLY CAR PAYMENT!*AK",

NOW IT IS THE TIRES AND ALIGNMENT THE ALIGNMENT IS COMPLETELY OFF THAT THE TIRES ARE DESTROYED WITH ONLY 17,250 MILES ON THEM, YET THE CAR SHOWS NO SIGN OF THE ALIGNMENT BEING OFF, IT DRIVES STRAIGHT STAYS IN ONE LANE AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS EVEN STRAIGHT, SO HOW AFTER ONE YEAR WITH LOW MILES IS THE ALIGNMENT OFF AND THE TIRES ARE DESTROYED, AND WHY WAS IT UNNOTICED WHEN I HAD MY TIRES BALANCED AND ROTATED 2 MONTHS EARLIER AT 15,000 MILES? BY THE SAME DEALERSHIP! I FEEL THAT THIS CAR HAS ALOT OF PROBLEMS THAT THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT WANT TO ADDRESS, LOOK AT HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS, AND WE ARE ALL TOLD THAT IT IS WEAR AND TEAR OR THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL, WELL THEN WHY ARE WE ALL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS? I CALLED TOYOTA'S MAIN OFFICE LOGGED A COMPLAINT AND WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME, IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS NOW AND NOT ONE CALL HAS COME MY WAY! I FEEL THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS TO THIS CAR SINCE IT IS A NATION WIDE PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS A $27000.00 CAR THAT HAS DEPRECIATED IN VALUE BY MORE THAN $7000.00 IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR, WHAT HAPPENED TO TOYOTA'S RETAINING THERE VALUE? I WISH EVERYBODY MUCH LUCK WITH THEIR ISSUES.   *NLM",

THEY HAVE TOLD ME: 1) THAT IT IS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, 2) THAT IT HAPPENS IN ABOUT 70 OF EVERY 3,000+ CARS PRODUCED, 3) THAT I SHOULD TRY A NEW GASOLINE AND 4) THAT IT WILL GO AWAY AT AROUND 6,000 MILES.  I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL NEW GASOLINES AND AM CURRENTLY AT 5,000 MILES WITH NO CHANGE TO THE SMELL.  I WILL TAKE MY CAR INTO THE SHOP TWO MORE TIMES FOR THE SAME COMPLAINT AND THEN WILL ATTEMPT TO INVOKE THE LEMON LAW IN OREGON.",

HOWEVER, I DISCOVERED WHILE SPEAKING WITH THE TIRE MANUFACTURER(TOYO) THAT THE TIRES ARE CONSIDERED \"SUMMER\" TIRES AND ARE NOT MADE FOR SNOW AND/OR ICE.

I CONTACTED THE DEALER AS I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE PURCHASING CAMRYS WITHOUT KNOWING THEY NEED TO PURCHASE SNOW TIRES OR ALL SEASON TIRES.  THEY APPARENTLY ARE NOT AS CONCERNED AS I AS THEY STATED THEY WOULD NOT DEBATE ON WHAT I WAS TOLD AT THE TIME OF THE SALE AND THE ONLY THING THEY COULD DO FOR ME IS TO ORDER REPLACEMENT TIRES AT A DISCOUNT.  I THEN PROCEEDED TO CALL THE TIRE MANUFACTURER BACK TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD PAY 75% OF THE COST OF THE SAME TIRE (TOYO, J33, P21560R 16 94V), TO REPLACE THE EXISTING TIRES.  THEY STATED I COULD REPLACE THE TIRES WITH ANY MAKE OF MY CHOICE. IT WAS THEIR PREFERENCE THAT I USE A LOCAL COMPANY THAT SELLS TOYO TIRES. I STOPPED TO ORDER REPLACEMENT TIRES AND FOUND AFTER INSPECTION, THE TIRES ARE BARE DOWN THE CENTER AND ARE WORN DOWN TO THE WEARBARS. SO NOT ONLY AM I DRIVING, WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE, A CAR THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY TYPE OF TREAD FOR SNOW/ICE I AM DRIVING WITH MINIMAL TREAD. I UNDERSTAND THE TIRES ARE  HIGH PERFORMANCE TIRES, HOWEVER I DO NOT FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE WORN IN THE MANNER THEY DID AFTER 14000 MILES.  I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS, ONE BEING WITH TOYOTA AND THE FACT THAT THE DEALER OR DEALERS ARE NOT INFORMING THE BUYER OF THE NEED TO PURCHASE ALL SEASON OR SNOW TIRES AT THE TIME OF THE SALE.

ASSURED THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK, I DROVE HOME.  TWO BLOCKS DOWN THE STREET, I COULD HEAR THE BRAKES SQUEAKING AGAIN.  I IMMEDIATELY TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPT.  THEY FOUND  THAT THE FRONT BRAKE PADS NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PARTS AND WOULD CALL ME WHEN THE PARTS WERE DELIVERED. AFTER THEY NOTIFIED ME OF THE DELIVERED PARTS, I BROUGHT THE CAR IN ON APRIL 4, 2002.  ONE HOUR LATER, THEY TOLD ME THAT BOTH ROTORS WERE CRACKED! AGAIN, THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PARTS AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM THE NEXT DAY.  MEANWHILE I HAD TO GET A RENTAL TO GO HOME, WHICH THEY PAID FOR.  NEXT MORNING, I CALLED THEM TO CHECK ON THE STATUS.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE PARTS WOULD NOT COME IN FOR ANOTHER WEEK.  SO THEY PLANNED TO TAKE ROTORS OFF FROM ANOTHER \"BRAND NEW\" CAMRY AND PUT THEM ON MINE.  THE REPAIR WAS FINISHED AROUND NOON TIME.  WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, THE SERVICE ADVISOR REASSURED ME THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE.AFTER DRIVING FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, I STARTED TO HEAR SQUEAKY BRAKES AGAIN.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE NOISE CAME FROM OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD.  AS THE SQUEAK GOT LOUDER AND MORE FREQUENT, I KNEW THE NOISE WAS FROM MY NEW CAMRY.  I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPT. ON MAY 8, 2002.  WITHIN ONE HOUR,  THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO FIX IT, PENDING ADVICE FROM TOYOTA..  SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WOULD GET IT BUT SAID THAT SQUEAKY BRAKES SHOULD NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE.I DO NOT THINK THE DEALER IS TAKING THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY.  THE BRAKES ARE SQUEAKING BADLY.
