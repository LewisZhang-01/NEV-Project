RESULT OF PROBLEM IS UNEXPECTED AND RAPID BUBBLING OVER AND OVERHEATING PLACING OCCUPANTS IN POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE, ALMOST STRANDED IN BLIZZARD IN 1/05.  HAD TO PULL OVER ON HIGH SPEED HIGHWAYS IN SUMMER 05 DUE TO RAPID RED LINING AND RISK OF ENGINE FIRE. SUBARU PICKED UP 1/2 COST ALTHOUGH NOT IN WARRANTY FOR US AND HAS DONE 1/2 TO FULL FOR OTHERS WHO COMPLAINED.   ONE OF THE 2.5L ENGINES HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RECALL.  THE 2.5L ENGINE IN OUR CAR HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AS FREQUENT (AND WORSE) AND THE CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED.  THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.  LOCAL MECHANIC SAID HE SEES FREQUENTLY ON SUBARU OUTBACK.  FOUND INTERNET WEBLOG STARTED 18 MONTHS AGO WHICH HAS 275 COMPLAINTS AND GROWING MONTHLY  - ON BOTH THE 2.5L ENGINES (INCLUDING THE ONE IN OUR CAR).  BAD ENOUGH WE HAD TO INCUR $800 OF THE $1600 COST BUT PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AROUND WITH AN ENGINE THAT REPEATEDLY HAS FAILED (HEAD GASKET) AND CREATED A HAZARDOUS CONDITION.

I THEN STOPPED AT A BANK TO TAKE CARE OF A TRANSACTION, AND AS I WAS LEAVING THE BANK, I AGAIN SMELLED A FAINT BURNING ODOR. LUCKILY, NOT FAR DOWN THE ROAD, I PASSED MY SUBARU DEALERSHIP, FOR A SHORT DISTANCE PAST THE DEALERSHIP I HEARD A CRACKLING COMING FROM MY CAR RADIO. THINKING I'D LEFT IT ON, I WENT TO TURN IT OFF, ONLY TO DISCOVER IT WAS OFF. THEN THE BURNING SMELL BECAME MUCH MORE EVIDENT, AND I REALIZED I MUST HAVE AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. I TURNED AROUND, AND WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY DISCOVERED THAT COFFEE HAD SPILLED ONTO THE RADIO FROM THE STYOFOAM CUP(WHICH HAD A TIGHT CAP ON IT, BY THE WAY!), CAUSING THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. A WOMAN I HAD BEEN CHATTING WITH WHILE WAITING FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC WORK TO BE DONE SAID THAT HER '97 SUBARU HAD HAD THE CUP HOLDER BY THE RADIO TOO, BUT THAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THE CUP HOLDERS HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THAT LOCATION. IF THE SUBARU COMPANY HAD KNOWN OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE, WHY WASN'T I MADE AWARE OF IT? LUCKILY, I WAS NOT COMING THROUGH THE BLACKS WOODS INTO ELLSWORTH WHICH IS 20 MILES OF NOTHING BUT TREES! I BOUGHT MY SUBARU BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUTED AS ONE OF THE SAFEST VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THEY ARE TAKING CARE TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS OF PENDING SAFETY ISSUES. TODAY COST ME OVER $T60.00, AND I'M OUT A RADIO TO BOOT. BUT I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WAS NEAR A SUBARU DEALER, BECAUSE THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS.  THE DEALERSHIP KEPT THE RADIO AND TOLD ME THEY COULD ORDER ONE, BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SHIPPED FROM CA.

IT WAS REPORTED TO THE SOUTHERN OREGON SUBARU DEALER WITHIN APPROXIMATELY THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP WHEN WE HAD POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT MERELY A PROBLEM WITH INCORRECT PLACEMENT OF THE SHIFT LEVER DURING SHIFTING.  FOLLOWING THE DEALER'S INITIAL REFUSAL TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, SUBSEQUENT CONTACT WITH SUBARU OF AMERICA RESULTED IN THE ASSIGNMENT OF CASE NUMBER 201743.  ACCORDING TO SOA, THE DEALER ALLEGEDLY WAS CONTACTED.  NEVERTHELESS, ON THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED, THE DEALER AGAIN REFUSED.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A WELL-DOCUMENTED PROBLEM CHARACTERISTIC OF SUBARU OUTBACK AND FORESTER VEHICLES (SEE THE WEB SITE CITED AND RELATED COMMENTS.)  IT APPEARS THAT SUBARU IS UNWILLING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM UNLESS REQUIRED TO BY NHSTA.  PLEASE PROTECT MYSELF AND OTHER SUBARU OWNERS BY MAKING THIS A MANDATORY SAFETY RECALL.  THANK YOU.
