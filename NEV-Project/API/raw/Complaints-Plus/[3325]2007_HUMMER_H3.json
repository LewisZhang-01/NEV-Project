I MAINTAIN MY VEHICLE TO HIGH STANDARDS AND OVER THE LAST 8 MONTHS HAVE HAD ISSUES STARTING MY HUMMER.  WHEN THE HUMMER DOES NOT START, YOU MUST WAIT 10-15 MINUTES TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO RESTART.  THE VEHICLE WILL TURN OVER, BUT NO FUEL IS SENT TO THE ENGINE TO START.  IF IT DOESN'T START AGAIN, YOU MUST WAIT ANOTHER 10-15 MINUTES.  THE LATTER HAS HAPPENED TO ME 5 OR 6 TIMES IN JUST THE LAST 2 MONTHS. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS TO GM ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE, AND HAS FALLEN ON DEAF EARS.  MANY VEHICLE FORUM USERS COMPLAIN OF THE EXACT ISSUE AS WELL, WITH ZERO ASSISTANCE FROM GM AS SEEN HERE: HTTPS://WWW.CARGURUS.COM/CARS/DISCUSSION-C8039_DS531571    I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THE SPORADIC SECURITY LOCKDOWN (PASSLOCK) OCCURS WHILE DRIVING, FUEL IS CUT OFF FROM THE RUNNING ENGINE, SPEED/STEERING/BRAKING WILL BE MINIMIZED, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A CRASH IS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY.  PLEASE ADVISE GM THERE NEEDS TO BE A FIX FOR THIS AND ENSURE THEY COMPLY!  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

MY WIFE AND I HAVE REACHED OUT TO GM ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WITH NO RESOLUTION IN SITE.  I ASK THAT THE NHTSA DEMAND GM ESTABLISH A TIMELINE FOR THE COMPLETION OF A CORRECTED PART AND THAT GM PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE OPTION TO GM CUSTOMERS FACED WITH THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE PART IS AVAILABLE.   MY CONCERN IS OVER MY WELL-BEING AS WELL AS MY FAMILIES.  ON MONDAY AUGUST 31, 2015, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN I NOTICED A BURNING SMELL COMING FROM UNDERNEATH MY GLOVE BOX.  AFTER I PULLED OVER AND EXAMINED CLOSER I COULD SEE THE ISSUE WAS FROM THE A/C MODULE RESISTER THAT WAS RECENTLY RECALLED.  THE RESISTER HAD BURNED THROUGH PART OF THE HARNESS ATTACHMENT.  UPON REACHING OUT TO GM, THEY STATED I ONLY HAD TWO COURSES OF ACTION:  1) TO REPLACE THE PART WITH ANOTHER FAULTY PART (WHICH I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR) AND HOPE THAT THE PART DOES NOT SHORT / CATCH FIRE BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO COME OUT WITH THE CORRECTED PART (WHICH WOULD BE FREE).  2) WAIT FOR A CORRECTED PART TO BECOME AVAILABLE.  THE MAIN ISSUES WITH THE SECOND OPTION ARE THAT GM HAS NO TIMELINE FOR THE COMPLETION/AVAILABILITY OF THE CORRECTED AC MODULE RESISTOR (CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID ANYWHERE FROM 1 MONTH TO MULTIPLE YEARS). THIS WOULD LEAVE THE CUSTOMER (WITHOUT HEAT OR A/C) FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. MY CURRENT WORK COMMUTE TOTALS 2 HOURS EVERY DAY.  WHERE I LIVE THIS BECOMES PROBLEMATIC DUE TO SEVERE SUMMER / WINTER CLIMATES (AS I WRITE TO YOU THERE ARE HEAT WARNINGS IN EFFECT).     GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE 2009, YET THEY FAILED TO ACT.  NOW THE CONSUMER IS FORCED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ILL PLANNING AND NEGLECT WHILE GM CONTINUES TO ACT INEPT.

GOT OUT AND SMELLED COOLANT VAPORIZING (DISTINCT SMELL).  I AM A RETIRED MASTER MECHANIC, WITH 44 YEARS EXPERIENCE (CURRENTLY AGE 60).  I EXAMINED THE RADIATOR, RINSED IT OFF AND DRIED IT, PRESSURIZED THE SYSTEM TO DISCOVER A HAIRLINE CRACK IN THE UPPER, PLASTIC TANK OF THE RADIATOR IN AN AREA WITH NO IMPINGEMENT OF OTHER COMPONENTS, NO TRAUMA, AND NO ROUGH USE, EVER.  I CAUGHT IT AT THE VERY FIRST MANIFESTATION, SOLELY BY THE SMELL.  EXAMINING THE VEHICLE CLOSELY TO DISCOVER WHILE MY RADIATOR HAD ONLY THIS HAIRLINE CRACK IN A LOCATION OF NO-STRESS AND NO IMPINGEMENT OF OTHER COMPONENTS.      RESEARCH FURTHER TO DISCOVER THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE H3, FROM 2006, 2007, 2008 AND 2009 MODELS ALL IN THE 50,000 TO 100,000 MILE READINGS.  THE REPLACEMENT OF THE RADIATOR AT LOCAL GM DEALER, WITH COOLING SYSTEM SERVICE WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE RADIATOR REQUIRES THE RECEIVER DRYER OF THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM TO BE DISCONNECTED WHICH REQUIRES DISCHARGE AND RECHARGE OF REFRIGERANT R124A.   I SAVED THE DEFECTIVE RADIATOR.  THERE IS NO OTHER WEAR NOR DAMAGE.  THE INTERNAL CORES WERE CLEAR AND CLEAN LIKE NEW.  NO OBSTRUCTIONS, DIRT NOR WEAR. IN OTHER WORDS I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE A PERFECTLY GOOD RADIATOR FOR 1 HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE UPPER PLASTIC TANK.  THIS REPAIR, INCLUDING ALL COURTESY DISCOUNTS FROM THE SELLING DEALERSHIP, AS I HAD BEEN AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP OWNER AND LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 30 YEARS OF MY LIFE, COST ME $966.57.      NHTSA SHOULD DO A FORMAL DEFECT INVESTIGATION ON ALL THE HUMMER H3 MODELS AND ANY / ALL OTHER GM LIKE-TYPE VEHICLES WITH THE PLASTIC TANK RADIATORS WHICH COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR DEATH.  *TR",

GOT MY SON AND STARTED HOME.  SITTING AT THE RED LIGHT, I SMELLED COOLANT AGAIN.  THIS TIME I KNEW IT WAS MY CAR.  WE WENT TO A SERVICE STATION AND ASK IF SOMEONE COULD CHECK TO SEE IF WE HAD A LEAK.  THEY PULLED MY H3 INTO THE BACK AND HOOKED UP A PRESSURE \"TOOL\" TO THE RADIATOR AND LOW AND BEHOLD, BUT A HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE UPPER DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE RADIATOR.  THE MECHANIC LAUGHED AND SAID I WAS THE 2ND ONE THIS WEEK AND THE 6TH ONE SINCE THEY OPENED 6 MONTHS AGO.  HE SAID THAT H3S WERE KNOWN TO HAVE RADIATOR ISSUES BECAUSE THE RADIATORS WERE PLASTIC!  SERIOUSLY...PLASTIC!  I WAS GIVEN A QUOTE OF $1,100 TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR WITH ANOTHER PLASTIC ONE AND THAT WOULD GIVE ME A 2 YEAR OR 24,000 MILE WARRANTY.  I BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK TO MY HOUSE SO MY HUSBAND COULD LOOK AT IT.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH HUMMERS AND YET GM HAS NOT DONE A RECALL.  I FOUND A NUMBER FOR HUMMER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CALLED THEM.  WHEN I TOLD THE MAN THAT ANSWERED I HAD COOLANT LEAKING, HE SAID \"OH, GIVE ME YOUR ZIP CODE AND I WILL FIND A LOCAL DEALERSHIP THAT CAN REPLACE THE RADIATOR.\"  NO QUESTIONS...HE KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS ALREADY.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO \"INVEST\" IN A DIAGNOSTIC AND IF THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED IT WAS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT, THAT HUMMER MIGHT \"PARTICIPATE\" IN THE REPAIR COSTS.  I WOULD THINK WITH THIS BEING SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM, A RECALL WOULD BE IN ORDER AND POSSIBLY A REPLACEMENT RADIATOR THAT ISN'T PLASTIC!  *TR",

NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED, SO NO RECALL HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.  BUT IT'S A WELL KNOWN DEFECTIVE RADIATOR PROBLEM THAT GM KNOWS ABOUT BUT WON'T RECALL.

THE PROBLEM IS THE MIDDLE PIN THAT HOLDS THE RADIATOR RUBS THE NECK AND STARTS A CRACKED UNDER THE STYROFOAM, THUS THE RIGHT DRIVERS SIDE CRACKS IN THE SAME SPOT AS WELL ON THE PLASTIC SIDE.

        "summary": "YESTERDAY MAVIS WAS VISITING OUR DAUGHTER (BRENDA) IN KILLEEN. BRENDA OWNS ONE OF THOSE FANCY H3 BURNT ORANGE HUMMERS WITH ALL THE DOODADS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST ROLLED OFF OF FORT HOOD READY FOR WARFARE. IF FACT IT ATTACKED MY LOVELY DEMURE WIFE WITH NO PROVOCATION WHATSOEVER.    NOW REALIZE I WAS DUTIFULLY WORKING AT MY JOB WHILE MAVIS WAS OUT   BUT SHE SWEARS BY THE STORY AND AT ME.    MAVIS AND BRENDA JUMP IN THE HUMMER TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR IN TEMPLE WHICH IS ABOUT A 20 MILE TRIP. BRENDA WAS DRIVING. SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE MAVIS STARTS SQUIRMING AROUND IN THE SEAT COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW HOT THE SEAT WAS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN THE DARN SEAT HEATER OFF. SHE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS HAVING HOT FLASHES. BRENDA PULLS OFF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND RUNS AROUND THE HUMMER, HOPING NO ONE RUNS OVER THEM, TO TURN OFF THE SEAT HEATER. SHE TURNS THE HEATER OFF OR SO SHE THOUGHT. SHE HEADS DOWN THE ROAD AGAIN WHEN MAVIS HOLLERS THAT HER BOTTOM WAS BURNING OFF. SHE PULLS OFF THE ROAD AGAIN AND THEY FINALLY GET THE DARN THING TURNED OFF. THE SEAT AND MAVIS? BOTTOM START TO COOL DOWN. AFTER VISITING THE FAMILY DOCTOR THEY RETURNED TO KILLEEN AND MAVIS JUMPED IN OUR CAR TO HEAD FOR HOME. THE 2 HOUR TRIP FROM KILLEEN TO RED OAK TOOK NEARLY 6 HOURS. SOME KNOT HEAD DAMAGED A BRIDGE ON I35 SHUTTING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. I WAS WATCHING TV WHEN MAVIS GOT HOME AND SHE IMMEDIATELY RUNS IN THE BEDROOM PULLING DOWN HER SLACKS AND SHE SHOWS ME 1ST AND 2ND DEGREE BURNS ON THE BACK OF HER THIGHS AND HER BOTTOM. THE BURNS LOOK VERY PAINFUL AND VERY UGLY. I TOOK PICTURES. SOME PICTURES ARE OF THE BURNS.    TODAY BRENDA CALLED GM TO INFORM THEM OF THE ATTACK. THEY THINK A HEAT SENSOR MUST HAVE FAILED BUT WE?LL KNOW MORE AFTER THEY TAKE A LOOK AT IT. IT?S AMAZING THAT NEITHER THE SEAT NOR HER CLOTHING SHOWED ANY HEAT DAMAGE.  MAVIS IS DOING WELL BUT IS A BIT TENDER. SHE IS GOING TO BE SORE FOR A FEW DAYS.  *JB",
