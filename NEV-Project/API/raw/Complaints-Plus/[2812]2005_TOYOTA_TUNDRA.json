WHEN STATIONARY ON COLD START: VEHICLE PRODUCES A LOUD NOISE AND ADDITIONAL CARBON MONOXIDE/EXHAUST, CAUSING ADDITIONAL DANGER WHEN STARTING IN A GARAGE.    WHEN IN MOTION: TRUCK OPERATES AS INTENDED UNTIL ACCELERATION IS ATTEMPTED, CAUSING A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN WHEN MERGING ONTO HIGHWAYS, DRIVING UP AN INCLINE, OR ANY OTHER DRIVING SITUATION WHERE THE GAS APPLICATION IS NECESSARY.     WHEN IN MOTION: VENTING AND INTERIOR AIR CONTROLS CANNOT BE USED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXHAUST THAT WILL SPILL INTO THE CAB OF THE TRUCK.    THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS WIDELY KNOWN TO THE TOYOTA COMMUNITY, AND TO DRIVERS OF TOYOTA TUNDRAS IN PARTICULAR. OF NOTE, THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED IN THE TOYOTA MESSAGE BOARDS (TUNDRA TALK, TOYOTA NATION, TUNDRAS.COM, TUNDRA SOLUTIONS). IN ADDITION, THERE IS A SEPARATE COTTAGE INDUSTRY THAT HAS SPRUNG UP AS A RESULT, WHERE MANUFACTURERS ARE PRODUCING BYPASS KITS THAT COMPROMISE THE EXHAUST STANDARDS SET BY YOU ALL, WHERE AN ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN CREATED TO PROFIT OFF OF THESE ISSUES. ONE OF THE PRIMARY PARTIES IS HEWITT-TECH.     WHEN ADVISED AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, THE REPAIR QUOTE WAS $2568 OUT OF POCKET.    WHEN SPEAKING TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, I WAS TOLD THEY DO NOT ANTICIPATE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE, AS IT IS NOT ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM. IN GREATER RESEARCH, IT IS APPARENT THEY ARE EITHER AWARE BUT UNWILLING TO REMEDY THE SITUATION BECAUSE A) THE SCOPE IS FAR TOO WIDESPREAD WITHIN THEIR TRUCK MARKET (EVERY TOYOTA TUNDRA IS SUBJECT TO RECALL) OR B) THE SCOPE IS TOO WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE MARKETSHARE (SIMILAR PROBLEMS ARE INDICATED WITH THE COROLLA AND OTHER PASSENGER CARS).

I WAS TOLD BY TOYOTA (CASE NUMBER [XXX]) THAT BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS OWNER TOOK THE BAND-AID THEY WERE NO LONGER LIABLE UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT FORCED THEM VIA FURTHER GOVERNMENT SAFETY RECALL ACTIONS TO DO MORE.  MY HOPE IS BY WRITING THIS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN BE PROACTIVE AND SOLVE THIS SAFETY CONCERN BEFORE THEY HAVE TO COLLECT ENOUGH DEATH AND ACCIDENT STATISTICS TO TAKE NOTICE OF THIS ISSUE. NOT ONLY THAT, I SEE THAT TOYOTA IS BEING OFFERED THE SAME BAND-AID SOLUTION ON A NUMBER OF NEW MODELS WITH THE SAME ISSUE - PROVING THAT THEY DIDN'T LEARN ANY LESSON JUST HOW THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ACTUAL MURDER.  THE RESULT WILL BE MORE VEHICLES IN 5 YEARS IN WORSE SHAPE DUE TO THE LENIENT RECONCILIATION MANDATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  DO NOT PUT MORE LIVES AT RISK IN ORDER TO SAVE A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES BOTTOM LINE.

IT'S UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR MAY EXPLAIN SOME OF THE CURRENT \"SURGING\" PEOPLE ARE SEEING IN OTHER TOYOTAS.  THIS IS A 100% SOFTWARE PROBLEM (I AM A ELECTRONIC ENGINEER).    DESCRIPTION:  WHEN THE ENGINE IS AT IDLE, OR EVEN WORSE, WHEN YOU ARE DECELERATING AT IDLE POWER, AND YOU INCREASE THE THROTTLE POSITION OF THE GAS PEDAL, THERE IS A NEARLY 1-SECOND DELAY BEFORE THE ENGINE RESPONDS TO THE THROTTLE INPUT.  IF THE DRIVER, NOT SENSING ANY RESPONSE TO THROTTLE, APPLIES MORE AND MORE THROTTLE DURING THAT ONE SECOND DELAY, WHEN THE ENGINE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE FINALLY DOES RESPOND IT WILL IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE HIGHEST THROTTLE SETTING THE DRIVER WAS SELECTING, CAUSING A HUGE LURCHING FORWARD ACTION OF THE VEHICLE.      FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE DRIVER APPLIED THROTTLE IN THIS FASHION:  0SEC=5% THROTTLE; 0.25SEC=10% THROTTLE; 0.5 SEC=20% THROTTLE; 0.75SEC=35% THROTTLE; 1.0SEC=50% THROTTLE.

THIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS WHILE CHANGING LANES DURING STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.    PLEASE NOTE THAT IF I AM RUNNING AT PARTIAL POWER/THROTTLE, THIS BEHAVIOR DOES NOT HAPPEN, AND THE GAS PEDAL RESPONSE IS PROPER.  ONLY FROM IDLE OR DECELERATING.    I HAVE COMPLAINED NUMEROUS TIMES TO MY TOYOTA DEALER, TO WHICH THE SERVICE MANAGER FINALLY REPLIED TO ME \"YOU THINK THE TUNDRA IS BAD... YOU SHOULD TRY DRIVING THE SIENNA!

IN FEB 2007 THE THROWOUT BEARING STARTED TO GO BAD AT APPROX. 30,000 MILES (VEHICLE WAS ABOUT 8 MONTHS OLD) AND THE DEALER REPLACED THE ENTIRE CLUTCH UNDER WARRANTY. ABOUT A YEAR LATER THE THROWOUT BEARING WENT OUT AGAIN, WITH ABOUT 65,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER AGAIN REPLACED THE ENTIRE CLUTCH UNDER WARRANTY AND ALSO REPLACED THE BELL HOUSING, STATING THAT THE BELL HOUSING WAS DEFECTIVE AND WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. NOW THE VEHICLE HAS ABOUT 82,000 MILES ON IT, IS 5 YEARS OLD, AND THE THROWOUT BEARING IS AGAIN MAKING NOISES, INDICATING THAT THE CLUTCH IS GOING OUT AGAIN. THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR A CLUTCH TO WEAR OUT 3 TIMES IN 5 YEARS. I DO MOSTLY HIGHWAY DRIVING ON FLAT ROADS AND DO NOT TOW ANYTHING. THE TRUCK IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE CLUTCH REPLACEMENT COSTS QUITE A BIT. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS THE CAUSE OF THE CLUTCH REPEATEDLY GOING OUT. NOT MANY TUNDRAS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION EVER CAME OUT AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF PARTS OR DESIGN FLAW THAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

I WAS THEN IN A CONTROLLED SKID ON A STRAIGHT PART OF THE HIGHWAY AND HELD THE STEERING WHEEL IN THAT POSITION. I DID NOT APPLY THE BRAKES AS I DID NOT WANT TO ALTER THE DIRECTION OF THE SKID.
