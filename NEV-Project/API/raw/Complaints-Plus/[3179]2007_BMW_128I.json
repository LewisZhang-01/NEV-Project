SHOULD THE TIRES EXPLODE AT A HIGH SPEED, A PERSON COULD BE INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP A SPEEDING CAR AT A HIGH SPEED.  THE RUN FLAT TIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVEN 50 MORE MILES AT 50 MPH TO A SAFE LOCATION IF A PERSON RUNS OVER SOMETHING IN THE ROAD. BUT WITH THE TIRES BULGING ON THE SIDES, THERE IS CERTAINLY NO WAY TO PROTECT THE PASSENGER INSIDE THE VEHICLE  THESE TIRES APPEAR TO BE DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED. *TR",
