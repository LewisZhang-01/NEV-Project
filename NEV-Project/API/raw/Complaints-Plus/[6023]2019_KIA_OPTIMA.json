        "summary": "We own 2 2019 Kia optimas, one my 20yr old daughter drives. On her way to school she smelled a burning smell. On her way home at a dangerous intersection she smelled a strong burning smell & the car just stopped. I told her to get out of the car quickly, she had to climb to the right side as it was too unsafe to exit from the left. Thankfully she wasn\u2019t on a 55 mile/hr road bc it just stopped abruptly & surely would have been hit as brake lights would not have warned. The car was towed to the dealership where it was purchased & under warranty on Friday 3/18/22. Saturday 3/19/22 I went to inquire what happened & was told by the service advisor that it started once, there was a burning smell coming from the engine & the engine was only running on 2 cylinders & stopped. He said they created a ticket, which I came to know that they were conferring with Kia engineers by Kia consumer affairs & I also created a case with. We did research & found a class action suit that was settled describing the exact problem that we experienced, however bc it was settled, Kia was never had to issue a broad recall, so if your 2019 optima experienced this very serious problem of engine failure & fires after 11/30/2021, they say Kia will be handling the cases on a rolling basis, however we just got the run around & the car remains there today 3/26/22 unfixed & the dealership is trying to say it\u2019s just a fuel pump & if that was the case, they wouldn\u2019t need 8 days waiting for Kia engineers to be fixed. In the settlement, Kia was also noted to be denying proper fixes for this serious issue with cars still under warranty. We were denied a rental car & they will not call us. This is my daughter\u2019s life, please help us. The other 2019 Kia Optima that I drive was brought to the same dealership under warranty complaining of the engine sputtering & jumping, they did nothing & said it should be fine however it\u2019s still doing it & my daughter is now driving this potentially dangerous car to school.  This vehicle has been there since 03/18/22 & it\u2019s 03/29/22.",
