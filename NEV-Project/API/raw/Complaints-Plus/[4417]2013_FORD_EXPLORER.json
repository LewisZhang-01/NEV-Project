My family and other's lives were at risk when my explorer lost power steering capabilities while driving. The power steering was completely disabled almost making it impossible to navigate. The vehicle had to be towed because it was such a hazard to drive with local traffic. Upon the loss of the power steering a \"power steering assist\" light illuminated on the dash. The local Ford dealership noted that this was a known problem and the 2013's were actually recalled for this exact issue. Once they looked up my VIN number they noted that mine was not included even though it is textbook for the other 2013 explorers which noted the same problem that caused this recall. Ford has not been of any help and instructed I submit this complaint here. The repair is not an affordable cost to swallow when there is an open recall for the exact problem on the SAME years, but for some reason mine was not included.",

Shortly after that I stopped at a Walmart service location off the highway, but by then the light wasn\u2019t on and the mechanic said \u201cthey don\u2019t do anything regarding engines\u201d.   Then about a week later it flashed again then I was ready and able to take a picture (attachment #1) it said \u201cengine coolant over temperature\u201d. I called several repair shops and dealerships and had gotten a few estimates (attachment #2). One place added a lot of coolant (Grease Monkey) and that seem to get me going and I didn\u2019t see the light again until about 3 to 4 weeks later. Then my husband and I had to start checking my coolant level daily to see if more coolant had to be added which most times it did.  The high cost for repair - is in getting to the water pump - which I\u2019m being told by at least 4 people can take 11 to 12 hours of labor. One repair place said \u201cI may be better off by getting rid of the SUV\u201d.   I previously had a 2003 Ford Explorer (original owner) kept it for 10 years then upgraded to a 2013 Ford Explorer (original owner) and thought I could do the same, however costly problems started in 2021.  Ford is aware of all of the water pump related issues and should have a recall and/or make repairs free of charge. This has been apparently going on for 10+/- years.  In October 2021 once while on a rural highway in Colorado about 30 minutes from home my car ran hot and stalled on me and my son who is disabled and cannot walk. We putt putted over to a restaurant lot, had to let the car cool down to then add water.  After that we almost made it home before the light came on again, we were about 3 minutes from home.  That was very scary to be driving in traffic and your car stalls.   My car has been sitting for the last 4 months because of the cost for needed repairs.",

The service representative told me that the vehicles core steering had an internal failure and that it would take up to 2 months to get the parts and cost $3,173.39 to affect the steering repair. I asked and was told that Ford has over 1,300 of these specific steering units on back order. This tells me that they not only burned through their reserve supply of that part, but that they also have a demand for 1,300 more ! This is an obvious safety issue which has rendered my Explorer un-drivable. If the failure had occurred at high speed the consequences could have been grave! Apparently, I'm not the only one experiencing this specific issue. In my opinion, the steering was inadequately engineered, resulting in premature failure. My Explorer is my wife's daily driver. It has never been taken \"off road\" or subjected to any other duress. It is strictly a city/highway vehicle. After contacting Ford (Case No.  CAS-34220695-K8P5P6 CRM:0222477) and voicing my concern, All that they offered was to expedite the parts request. I am 63 years old and have owned 16 automobiles, 9 have been Fords. Never have any of them required any service to the steering mechanism, much less a total failure of that system. Ford has an obvious problem with this part and I should not be required to pay over $3,000.00 to correct their engineering shortcumming. I respectfully request that you intervene on my behalf and attempt to resolve the issue. There are no open recalls or warranties on this vehicle at this time.",

My momentum took me out of the roundabout where I pulled over in a parking lot. As I put the car in park It begin to shake in idle. I turned the engine off and waited a few seconds then tuned it back on. The car drove just fine after that for about two days then this incident happened again twice in one day.

These incidents have put my family in dangerous situations. When researching online I found multiple accounts of this same issue. According to online forums it looks like it may be a problem with the throttle body.",

The back doors locked and will not unlock with the key fob, the indoor lock controls, or manually attempting to unlock the doors. The rear doors cannot be opened from the outside or inside when the locking mechanisms stop working. It poses a large risk when there are children in the car. And the front doors can be opened from the inside when the locking mechanisms stop working. It seems as though the locks start to act up when the weather is below 60\u00b0F. It is so sporadic that  we can\u2019t risk to take our family or children anywhere as we have to maneuver them out of car seats to get them out through front doors instead.   I have taken our vehicle into our local Ford dealer for inspection upon which they stated that a specific component wasn\u2019t working and it needed to be replaced, although that\u2019s not the case considering how sporadic the locks are. They work when it\u2019s warm and usually during the spring and summer, but all of a sudden when it\u2019s below 60\u00b0 they only want to work every so often. They should be a safety recall considering when people can\u2019t get out of their car it poses a large risk. There are no warnings for this happening, and I don\u2019t believe that the Ford dealership is even aware of what causes this as I\u2019ve seen on many online forums that a lot of Ford owners have this problem. This has been going on since we purchased our car in June 2020",

While up on jack stands and turning the wheel,  it done a \"shutter\" feeling.  when pulling back and forth on tire, it moved fine.  I made appointment with local Ford dealer and they inspected the front end and steering rack.  I paid 100.00 for the diagnose.  They told me I needed to replace steering rack.  costing up to 2500.00  If the price hadnt been bad enough news,  they told me it was not recalled, but complaints were high.  Also, told me that they can not get parts to fix it for a month or so???  which means, I am paying for a car that i can not drive. Something needs to be done!!  As i read through all the complaints on here about steering rack issues,  they need to watch over our saftey and others.  Im not happy with this situation.",

This is dangerous for the people driving around vehicles having this issue as a large piece of windshield trim can hit their windshield going 60 mph on a freeway or cause someone to swerve to not get hit by a flying object on the freeway.

I reached out several times to the dealer, they were waiting for parts due to COVID and supplier shortage in materials. In February I called back- Wayland Ford informed me I should have received a letter from Ford Motor which I did in Dec 2020 indicating my car did not need to be repaired. I did file a case with Ford Customer Care CAS30091178 for this very recall. There was nothing she could do, Ford is knowingly letting customers drive defective cars and Ford has chosen to do nothing to cast a wider net to make sure they have contained the defect therefore I am submitting a complaint.",

After struggling to steer the car off the road, I parked and turned the ignition off and back on again and the problem went away (power steering resumed as normal).  Then, after backing up again, the same thing happened in the same sequence.  Again, I parked, turned the car off and on again and once again, the power steering worked.  After this happened twice (in about 15 minutes), the next time I started the car, the power steering assist fault prompt came up again and the power steering never resumed working.  I was about an hour away from my home and had to drive the car on the interstate and back home with no power steering and a traction management issue as well (steering became very jerky while adjusting wheel left or right to stay in lane, causing car to swerve back and forth).  I notified my salesperson right away, but since it was Saturday, he said to bring it in first thing Monday.  I took the car to the dealership I bought it from the following Monday and it was diagnosed and the part was ordered, but apparently is on a national backorder due to the chip shortage.  Other prompts that came up (that never came up before) were \u2018Service Advance Trac\u2019 and another about the Terrain Management system.    The blinker also stopped working automatically- meaning it would not stay on when engaged all the way.  I had to hold it down to keep the blinker on, whereas before, it would stay on by itself if blinker arm was depressed all the way.

They stated per the recall an alignment should've been completed to complete the recall and advised I take it back to Ford. When I took it back to Ford, They stated a complete alignment wasn't completed and wasn't nesseccary only a partial was done and wanted to charge me to look at the vehicle again. I have kids and quite frankly it is scary to stop. I ended up taking it back to my local shop and had them do an alignment which it needed and I have documentation.

RECALL# 19S17  MA'AM, SIR,  I OWN A 2013 FORD EXPLORER, VIN#[XXX]. IN DECEMBER 2015, I MOVED TO GERMANY IN UNDER US ARMY ORDERS AND EXPORTED MY SUV TO OUR MILITARY INSTALLATION IN VILSECK, GERMANY. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD ISSUES WITH THE CAR, EXPERIENCING STEERING PROBLEMS AND TWICE LOST CONTROL, WHICH RESULTED IN TWO ACCIDENTS IN MARCH, 2016 AND NOVEMBER, 2017. OVER MY DEPLOYMENT TO GERMANY, I SOUGHT HELP FROM LOCAL FORD SITES IN BAVARIA, SPENT CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS TO FIX THE ISSUE THINKING THE BRAKES ARE THE ISSUES AND IN TIMES CHANGING TIRES, BUT IN VAIN. WHEN, I ATTEMPTED TO IMPORT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE HOMELAND UPON MY RECENT PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) BACK TO HURLBURT FIELD, FL, I FOUND OUT THAT THE SUV WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL FOR A DEFECT IN THE REAR TOE LINK, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF CRASH (FORD RECALL# 19S17 AND NTHSA RECALL# 19V435). I OBTAINED A WAIVER TO IMPORT THE CAR AND CALLED WORLD FORD PENSACOLA AS SOON AS MY CAR LANDED IN THE US ON JANUARY 27, 2020 TO SCHEDULE A FIX. THEY FIXED THE ISSUE ON JANUARY 29, 2020. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT FORD HAS MY UPDATED ARMY POST OFFICE (APO) ADDRESS BUT HAD NEVER NOTIFIED ME OF THIS IMPORTANT RECALL (I HAVE MAIL FROM FORD TO MY APO ADDRESS BUT NOT FOR THE RECALL).   FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, I DECIDED TO FILE A CLAIM WITH FORD CORPORATION FOR ALL OF THE EXPENSES INCURRED DUE TO THE MISHAP, INCLUDING MY ACCIDENT IN 2016 AND 2017. I CONTACTED YOUR HQ ,BUT IN VAIN. HE IGNORED MY PHONE CALLS AND MY EMAILS. THEREFORE, I AM REACHING OUT TO YOU IN WRITING.

DURING THE WINTER OF 2018-19 THEY BEGAN TO LEAK AIR EXCESSIVELY WHEN IT WAS COLD. THE LOSS WOULD GROW TO A POINT THE LOW AIR LIGHT CAME ON EVERY WEEK. IT WAS VARIOUS TIRES CAUSING THE ISSUE. THIS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE WINTER AND INTO THE SPRING OF 2019. THE LEAKS ARE MORE SEVERE WHEN DRIVING THAN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY.  I BELIEVE THE TIRES MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED TO THE POINT THAT THEY ARE CONTINUING TO LEAK WHEN IT IS WARM OUTSIDE NOW. OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS I HAVE HAD THEM IN 2 SEPARATE TIMES AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THE TIRES DO NOT HAVE A HOLE IN THEM NOR LEAK AT THE BEAD BUT ARE LEAKING DUE TO WEATHER OR OTHER. I HAVE MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS WITH COOPER TIRES TO HANDLE THE SAFETY ISSUE AND THEY  NOT HANDLED THEIR WARRANTY MATTER. I HAVE BEEN TO TWO SEPARATE DEALERS WHO SENT ME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INSTALLER AND THEY HAVE HAD THEM OFF TWO TIMES TO VERIFY THE ISSUE. BEFORE THIS SAFETY ISSUE BECOMES A SERIOUS INCIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TIRES INVESTIGATED OR POSSIBLY RECALLED.

IT WAS HAPPENING SO MUCH BUT INTERMITTENTLY SO I BOUGHT A INFRARED  GUN TO MEASURE THE HOT BRAKES. THE HIGHEST TEMPS RECORDED WAS 505 DEGREES. TWICE THE SQUEALING AND SCREECHING AND CRACKING SOUNDS OF METAL TO METAL  WAS SO LOUD THAT I WAS SCARED TO DRIVE  AND HAD TO TAKE IT DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER. TWICE THE BRAKES WENT DOWN TO BARE METAL WHERE EVERYTHING HAD TO BE REPLACE. THE OTHER TIMES I WAS ABLE TO CATCH IT BEFORE THAT BUT STILL HOW MUCH BRAKE WAS WORN OFF I COULDN'T KNOW. TWICE THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED CALIPERS , TWICE THEY REPAIRED RESTRICTIONS IN BRAKE HOSES TWICE THEY CLAIMED THE SLIDES WERE RUSTING UP AND HAD TO BE CLEANED ( NOT UNDER WARRANTY ) AND THE BRAKES WERE ONLY ABOUT A YEAR OLD WHEN THEY SAID THE SLIDES WERE RUSTED.THREE SETS OF BRAKES WERE INSTALLED. I AM NOT HARD ON BRAKES AS I STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL BRAKES ON THE FRONT. SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITH FORDS DESIGN OF THESE BRAKES THAT'S CAUSING THIS . I HAVE OWNED A FORD EXPLORER FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS AND NEVER ENCOUNTER THIS PROBLEM  NOR HAVE I HAD TO CLEAN THE SLIDES BETWEEN BRAKE JOBS. HOPE YOU CAN HELP AS I FEEL THE NEXT TIME THE BRAKES MAY FAIL COMPLETELY ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ALL THE TRAUMA MY BRAKE SYSTEM AS GONE THROUGH SO FAR.",

I DON'T BLAME NHTSB ON THIS AS I'M SURE LIKE MANY ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THE URGENT TOP ISSUES.  I'VE DRIVEN A NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN FAILURES THAT HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATING, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SOMETHING HAPPEN WHERE I WAS TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY.    THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS OR SOUNDS TILL ROUGHLY AN HOUR OR 70 MILES AFTER I HAD BEEN DRIVING AND DEALING WITH THE ISSUE.  THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRACTION TO FORDS STANCE THAT DRIVERS ARE NOTIFIED.  EVEN WITH THAT CONCENTRATED EFFORT I WAS NOT ABLE TO STAY IN MY LANE. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN A STRAIGHT LINE ON THE FREEWAY.  AS MY VEHICLE WOULD START TO DRIFT OUT OF A STRAIGHT LINE I WOULD MAKE A MINOR CORRECTION, THE VEHICLE WOULD CONTINUE TO DRIFT, SO I MADE AN INCREASED CORRECTION, THEN THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE A DELAYED RESPONSE TO MY INPUTS WHICH CAUSED OVER CORRECTION AND REQUIRED ME TO COUNTER CORRECT IN AN EFFORT TO STAY IN MY LANE.

THEN IT GOT WORSE WHEN THE WEATHER WARMED UP AND I USED THE AIR CONDITIONING. WE HAD TO ROLL THE WINDOWS DOWN TO AIR IT OUT. IT WAS MAKING ME SICK. IT SEEMS TO BE THE WORSE WHEN IT IS ACCELERATING AND WHEN IT IS IDLING. I TOOK IT TO KEN GARFF FORD IN ST. GEORGE UTAH AND THEY REPLACED SOME OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. THEY SAID THEY REPLACED THE SAME PARTS THAT THEY HAD REPLACED FOR THE ENTIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPLORERS IN OUR COUNTY (WASHINGTON COUNTY, UT) IT COST ME OVER 500 DOLLARS.  IT DID NOT FIX IT. IT SEEMED TO BE WORSE.THEY HAVE NOW ORDERED MORE PARTS AND SAID IT WILL COST ME OVER 500 DOLLARS AGAIN. THAT'S OVER $1,000 SO FAR. AND OVER THE LAST SIX MONTH I HAVE HAD HEADACHES ALMOST EVERY DAY. I AM KNOWN TO HAVE MIGRAINES BUT THIS IS NOW EXTREME. MY DOCTOR CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS NOW HAVING SO MANY HEADACHES AND MANY MORE MIGRAINES. NOW THAT I KNOW THE EXPLORER HAS FUME ISSUES I BELIEVE IT IS THE FUMES FROM THE CAR THAT ARE CAUSING THE HEADACHES AND MAKE ME FEEL SICK SO OFTEN. I FINALLY RESEARCHED ONLINE IF THE REPAIRS ARE WORKING AND IT SEEMS THAT FIXING IT THE WAY FORD HAS TOLD THE DEALERS TO FIX IT THAT THE RESPONSE IS THAT IT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I AGREE HAVING PUT MONEY INTO IT ALREADY AND IT ACTUALLY SEEMS WORSE. I DO NOT WANT TO SINK MORE MONEY INTO IT AND I FEEL THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS IF THE REPAIRS DO WORK.

THE SWITCH IS WITHIN THE SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY. THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD WHEN A VEHICLE IS NOT SECURED IN A PARKED POSITION.  FORD IS CHARGING CUSTOMERS $250-1000 TO FIX - DEPENDING UPON THE DEALER & CUSTOMER (MALE, FEMALE, WHITE, BLACK, HISPANIC) - & IT REQUIRES COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY. THIS COMPONENT IS PART OF THE POWER TRAIN BUT FORD WILL NOT COVER IT UNDER THE 5 YR/60000 MILE WARRANTY.  NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS WERE FOUND DURING GOOGLE SEARCH FOR \"FORD SHIFT TO PARK LEVER ASSEMBLY PROBLEM.\"  IF A VEHICLE IS POSITIONED ON A SLOPE, IT COULD EASILY ROLL AWAY AND INJURE SOMEONE. THIS FAILED ELECTRONIC COMPONENT COULD RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.  A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED BEFORE SOMEONE IS SEVERELY INJURED, NOT AFTER.     I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT MY VEHICLE IS ACTUALLY IN \"PARK\" ANY LONGER EVEN WHEN THE DISPLAY DOES NOT SHOW THE INDICATOR.  IN 9 OF 10 TIMES THE LAST THREE DAYS, THE INDICATOR HAS SHOWN THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOT IN PARK. IT DISPLAYS THE \"SHIFT TO PARK\" MESSAGE EACH TIME. IT IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY. I VISITED MY DEALER TODAY. THEY FIRST DENIED A TSB EXISTED.  THEN, I EXPLAINED THAT I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE ONE. SHOCKINGLY, THEY FOUND IT - ONLY AFTER I SAID I WOULD FILE THIS COMPLAINT. NHTSA SHOULD FORCE FORD TO ACT NOW BEFORE THIS BLOWS UP IN THE NEWS. THE NEGATIVE PR WILL BE BAD FOR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION, NHTSA, FORD, AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.

THE DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED HAVING PREVIOUS SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND STATED THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

(A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE SITES I SAW ARE CARCOMPLAINTS.COM, EDMUNDS.COM, AND RV.NET. A GOOGLE SEARCH WILL PROVIDE MANY MORE). I THEN CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY DIRECTLY AND SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE THERE. THEY SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT NO RECALL WAS GOING TO BE ISSUED, AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE REGARDING MY SPECIFIC PROBLEM. AFTER COMPLAINING PROFUSELY AND HAVING MY ISSUE ELEVATED TO A REGIONAL MANAGER, FORD AGREED TO PARTIALLY PAY FOR THE REPAIR.

I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE IN 6 TIMES WITH NO RESOLUTION AND FORD REFUSES TO BUY IT BACK. I HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY BEEN LIED TO THAT THE ISSUE IS THE PTU AND CONTINUED TO DRIVE WITH MY CHILDREN UNAWARE WE WERE BEING POISONED FOR 60K MILES. I CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER VEHICLE UNTIL A FIX SURFACES, WHAT AM I TO DO, DRIVE AROUND WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN? I DON'T FEEL THAT IS ACCEPTABLE IN A $52,000 VEHICLE, DO YOU? WHAT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE NOW SURFACING? SHOULD I KEEP PUTTING MY KIDS IN THIS CAR SINCE IT IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION? WOULD YOU PUT YOUR 4 AND 8 YEAR OLDS IN IT? SHAME ON THE NHTSA FOR NOT TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND CONTINUING TO ALLOW FAMILIES TO BREATH IN SUCH HAZARDOUS AND LIFE THREATENING FUMES.

HE SUCCEEDED WITH DIFFICULTY AS THERE WAS NO POWER TO THE BRAKES. EXTREME PAIN FOR DAYS, COVERED WITH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL BRUISES. MRI REVEALED A ROTATOR CUFF TEAR IN LEFT SHOULDER. ENDURED MONTHS OF PAIN/LOSS OF MOBILITY WHILE FINISHING PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA. RETURNED HOME TO CONNECTICUT, ENDURED A DIFFICULT ROTATOR CUFF + LABRUM REPAIR SURGERY. FACING MONTHS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AND A LONG, HOPEFULLY SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY.    THIS WAS THE 2ND SUCH INCIDENT WITH THIS VEHICLE, THE FIRST WITHOUT TRAUMA. LUCKY TO COME OUT OF THIS AS WELL AS I DID, I'M TOLD THE NEXT IN SEQUENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TIRE RUNNING OVER MY LEG. I KNOW OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISABLED + KILLED IN SUCH SCENARIOS. PLEASE DON'T NEGLECT THIS GLARING PROBLEM. I URGE THE NHTSA TO DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO REMEDIATE THIS GIANT LEAP BACKWARD IN VEHICULAR SAFETY.  *TR",

MAKE THIS VEHICLE, THE FORD EXPLORER SPORT,  EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ON HIGHWAY WHILE ACCELERATING AT ALLOWABLE SPEEDS. A LOCAL DEALERSHIPS' EXPERT (READ: DEALER IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR) IN INDIANA CONFIRMED MY OBSERVATIONS AND BELIEFS AND USED TERM \"SQUIRLYNESS\" TO DESCRIBE VEHICLES' HANDLING WHEN ACCELERATING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.   FORD INDICATES THAT VEHICLE OPERATES AS DESIGNED, I CONTENT THE DESIGN IS BAD, CAUSING THIS FORD EXPLORER SPORT VERSION TO BE VERY DANGEROUS. IN MY MIND IT IS ENTIRELY FORESEEABLE THAT ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN TO UNSUSPECTING DRIVERS OF THIS VEHICLE BASED ON THE VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT BE ADMITTED TO BY FORD DUE TO PRE-EMPTIVE LIABILITY ASSUMPTION IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS. I OFFERED FORD TO TAKE THIS NEW VEHICLE BACK. ONCE AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD NOT AS THIS WOULD IMPLY ADMITTANCE OF SAFETY CONCERNS REGARDING THE FORD EXPLORER SPORT VERSION.  *TR",
