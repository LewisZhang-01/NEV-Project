NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AT THAT TIME.   4TH OCCURRENCE - NOVEMBER 3, 2014 AT 75778 MILES:  AFTER HEARING A REPORT CONCERNING A GM RECALL  FOR VEHICLES WHICH ALLOWED REMOVING THE IGNITION KEY WHILE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, I ATTEMPTED AND WAS ABLE TO DO THIS ON MY VUE. I WENT TO SUBURBAN CADILLAC BUICK WHERE THE TECHNICIAN CONFORMED THAT THIS WAS A FACT.  HE CHECKED THE VIN AGAINST THE RECALL DATA BASE AND INFORMED ME THAT VUE WAS NOT ON THE LIST BUT THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE REPAIR MADE.  THE PARTS HAD TO BE ORDERED AND THE REPAIR WAS MADE ON DECEMBER 15, 2014.  THE IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER AND (2) KEYS WERE REQUIRED.  TOTAL COST: $330.36.",

SO I AM OUTSIDE OF EITHER OF THESE PARAMETERS SO THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO COST 5000.00 DOLLARS TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION. 4000.00 FOR PARTS AND APPROX.1000.00 FOR THE WORK OR THEY WILL GIVE ME 5000 DOLLAR CREDIT FOR THE CAR AS A TRADE IN ON A BRAND NEW GM VEHICLE THAT I WILL HAVE TO BUY TO GET ANY TRADE IN VALUE FOR THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE IS STILL IN PERFECT CONDITION BECAUSE I HAVE TAKEN REALLY GOOD CARE OF IT.  IT IS THE FIRST VEHICLE THAT I HAVE DRIVEN OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR AND I LOVE IT, BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.  THE SHOULD AT LEAST OF LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO HONOR THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ANYMORE SO THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO GET RID OF IT BEFORE IT CAME TO THIS.  THEY SAID THAT THEY SENT OUT PAPERWORK TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR, BUT I WASN'T GOING TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF EXTRA DOLLARS PAYING FOR A WARRANTY THAT WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT BEEN WORTH IT SINCE NOTHING ELSE HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE CAR.

        "summary": "THE IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER ON MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN HAVING ISSUES SINCE I BOUGHT IT. THE KEY WILL FALL OUT WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED WHILE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING. AFTER I AM STOPPED AND PARKED, THE IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER SEIZES UP AND WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO REMOVE KEY UNTIL AFTER I HAVE ALMOST EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO GET IT OUT, IE. SHAKING KEYS, BANGING ON IGNITION HOUSING, AND FINALLY HAVING TO USE FORCE AND ALMOST BREAKING THE KEY OFF IN THE IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK. AFTER LEAVING IT PARKED OVER NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY TRYING TO START MY CAR, THE KEY IS HARD TO GET INTO THE CYLINDER AND HARD TO TURN IT TO THE RUN POSITION, BUT YOU CAN TAKE THE KEY OUT AT ANYTIME IT'S IN THE RUN POSITION. I HAVE READ THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT THIS IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK ISSUE THE SAME AS I AM HAVING, AND BELIEVE THIS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 SATURN VUE'S MANUFACTURED BY GENERAL MOTORS. PLEASE ADVISE AS THIS IS ONE HECK OF A COSTLY REPAIR OF OVER 300 US DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE IGNITION SYSTEM. IF YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE AND CHECK WITH GM DEALERS ON THE NUMBERS OF VEHICLES THEY HAVE REPLACED THE IGNITION CYLINDER LOCK ON THE SATURN VUE'S I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND A HUGE PATTERN DEFECTIVENESS .  MY NEIGHBOR IS A MECHANIC AND SHE SAYS SHE'S DONE TONS OF THEM OVER THE YEARS ON THIS VEHICLE IN THE AFTERMARKET FIELD OF MECHANIC WORK. SHE'S THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED I CONTACT YOUR ORGANIZATION WITH THE PROBLEM. SHE HAS DONE RESEARCH OF INTERNET FORUMS AND FOUND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AND ALSO ON WEBSITES THAT LINK UP TO YOUR ORGANIZATION.   *TR",

BEFORE TAKING IT TO THE LOCAL CHEVY DEALER WE CALLED SEVERAL TRANSMISSION SHOPS AND THEY REFUSED TO DO THE WORK SINCE IT A CVT TRANSMISSION.  SO THE LOCAL CHEVY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AND IT HAD NOT BEEN 24 HOURS AND WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER THEY MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS WHICH DID NOT HELP SO THE DEALER HAD TO REPLACE IT A SECOND TIME. I AM DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. SO I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  THEY MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SECOND ONE AND DURING ONE OF THEIR TEST DRIVES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. SO THE SATURN VUE REMAINED AT THE DEALER FOR A MONTH. AND OF COURSE THE DEALER HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FOR A 3RD TIME. TRANSMISSION NUMBER 3 LASTED FOR OCTOBER OF 2013 TO FEBRUARY OF 2014.  THAT BEING SAID, THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED FOR THE 4TH TIME.  THIS ONE ONLY LASTED TO JUNE.  ON FRIDAY JUNE 13TH THE DEALER CALLED AND SAID THEY HAD TO ORDER THE 5TH REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION.  I CALLED GM ON FRIDAY JUNE 13TH AND I WAS VERY UPSET WITH THEM.  GM INFORMED ME AS SO DID THE DEALER THAT BECAUSE OF THE WARRANTY THE DEALER IS NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN A FAILED REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION.  MY HUSBAND AND I ARE REALLY UPSET, WE FEEL THAT BECAUSE OF THIS WARRANTY AND THE DEALER NOT BEING ALLOWED TO FIND OUT WHY ALL OF THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE FAILING GM IS COVERING SOMETHING UP.

THE SATURN MECHANIC EXPLAINED THAT THE DAMPER PULLEY HAD WALKED AWAY FROM THE BLOCK WHICH CAUSED THE SERPENTINE BELT TO SHRED.  THE SHREDDED PIECES GOT INTO THE TIMING BELT COVER CAUSING THE TIMING BELT TO SKIP AND BENDING ALL OF THE VALVES.  THE SATURN MECHANIC HAD NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE AND HAD AGREED THAT THE PART (DAMPER PULLEY) WAS DEFECTIVE.  BECAUSE THIS WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT, I THOUGHT THAT SATURN WOULD CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER GENERAL MOTORS AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED.  ESTIMATE COST FOR REPAIR ($7,000) DOLLARS.  I WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED FROM A DIFFERENT DEALER THAT SATURN WOULD NOT COVER THE DAMAGES.  I ALSO WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE DID HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANT ON IT PURCHASED BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER, BUT, BECAUSE THE WARRANTY WAS NOT CHANGED TO ME FOR THE $25. DOLLAR FEE, I COULD NOT USE THE WARRANTY.  I REALLY NEED SOME HELP.  THANKS. *TR",
