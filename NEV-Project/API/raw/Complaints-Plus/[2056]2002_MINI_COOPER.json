THE CAR GOT WORSE AND STARTED MAKING A LOUD CLUNKING SOUND FROM WHERE THE TRANSMISSION SITS AND THE CAR CONTINUED JOLTING NOT GOING FORWARD AS I BARELY HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER. AFTER TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND CHECKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE BY APPEARANCE (NO OIL LEAK, NO BLOWN GASKET, ETC), I RESTARTED THE CAR FINE, BUT THE CAR NEVER AGAIN ENGAGED INTO GEAR UNTIL I SPENT A WHOPPING $7,000 TO FIX IT. I WOULD SHIFT INTO D AND THE ENGINE WOULD REV, BUT THE CAR STAYED INERT. THE TRANSMISSION IS A CLOSED SYSTEM AND WHEN NO HARM IS DONE TO IT AND NO FLUID IS NOT LEAKING, TRANSMISSIONS SHOULDN'T POSE ANY PROBLEMS AT CONSIDERABLY LOW MILES (99K). I STARTED RESEARCHING ON THE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND SURE ENOUGH, THERE WAS A LONG LIST OF COMPLAINTS ON THE FAULTY DESIGN.     NEXT, I HAD TO SHOP FOR MECHANICS. ALL THE EXPERIENCED MINI MECHANICS TOLD ME THAT BMW OFFERED NO REPLACEMENT PARTS BECAUSE OF A PATENT THE INVENTOR HAD ON THE CVT DESIGN. I HAD TO HAVE THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION REPLACED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO OPTIONS BMW LEFT FOR THE CONSUMER. IT WAS EITHER YOU PAY $7,000 OR YOUR MINI WILL BE SCRAPPED AND NEVER RUN AGAIN. MY MECHANIC WAS NICE ENOUGH TO CHOP OPEN THE TRANSMISSION AND SAW THAT IT WAS JUST A METAL BELT THAT DRIVES THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS BROKEN. A SIMPLE BELT THAT PROBABLY COSTS NO MORE THAN $200 COULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND A WHOLE LOT OF CONSUMER MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF THE PART WAS AVAILABLE TO THE US- NOT TO MENTION THE WHOLE ORDEAL WOULDN'T BE THERE IF BMW HAD DESIGNED A RELIABLE TRANSMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE, (IE USE A REGULAR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION INSTEAD OF A CVT WHEN THE CVT HAS NOT BE FULLY TESTED FOR ITS RELIABILITY). *TR",

MINI HAS STATED THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE GLASS CRACKING DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION IN PREVIOUS BUILDS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A SURVEY FOR THE DEALERS TO PERFORM AN INSPECTION ON ANY WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENTS CONDUCTED UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS SURVEY IS EXPLAINED IN THIS BULLETIN SI M 51 02 03. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ONLY INSPECT THOSE WINDSHIELDS THAT DO NOT HAVE EVIDENCE OF STONE DAMAGE.  ON THE ATTACHED WEB SITES YOU WILL SEE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF CRACKED WINDSHIELD POSTS THAT THE DEALERS ARE CALLING STONE DAMAGE RELATED.  THEREBY INSURING THAT THESE WINDSHIELDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR DATA AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE NOT REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. I HAVE NO CHIPS BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKS FROM DEBRIS HITTING THE WINDSHIELD. I CALL THEM STRIKE MARKS. THE EASIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE DAMAGE IS THAT IT IS SIMILAR TO A GLASS ETCHING PROCEDURE. THE LOCATION WHERE THE DEBRIS HAS STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD IS SLIGHTLY DISCOLORED, YET NO GLASS IS MISSING. IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE RESULT OF TWO ITEMS: THE WINDSHIELD IS VERY STEEP AND THE GLASS IN THE WINDSHIELD IS SUBSTANDARD; TOO SOFT AND TOO THIN.  MINI USES THEIR WINDSHIELD AS A STRUCTURAL MEMBER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THEREFORE IT IS UNDER CONSTANT STRESS.  I DO NOT THINK THESE STRIKE MARKS ARE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE A STRESS CRACK PER SE, BUT IF THAT WERE SO (AS MINI ARGUES), THEN MY RESPONSE IS: THE WINDSHIELD IS NOT JUST TOO SOFT, IT IS TOO WEAK. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF STRIKE MARKS ON A WINDSHIELD IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT A CRACK THAT MIGHT APPEAR FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO CHIPPING WILL EITHER CROSS A STRIKE MARK, OR WILL RUN ACROSS THE NEAREST STRIKE MARK.  THESE STRIKE MARKS ARE A WEAKENED AREA AND WILL ATTRACT A CRACK. *JB  THE FOLLOWING URL\u0019S ARE PROVIDED FOR YOUR ATTENTION:  HTTP://MINICOOPERONLINE.COM  HTTP://WWW.MINI2.COM/FORUM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?S=&THREADID=21475  HTTPS://OL.MINIUSA.COM/OEMAINLOGIN.ASP",

THEY FINALLY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED, BUT IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.   I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO BE COMPENSATED ONLY FOR THE DAYS THE CAR WAS AT THEIR SHOP, ALSO I INFORMED THEM THAT IF THE MINI HAS TO BE TAKEN TO THE SHOP AGAIN, THAT WILL FORCE ME TO ENFORCE THE LEMON LAW.  MELISSA STEFFY, THE GENERAL MANAGER, SAID FOR ME TO SEND HER THE LETTER AND SHE WIL SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO, BUT THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR ANYTHING.  I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR BECAUSE I PURCHASED THE CAR TO USE IT, NOT FOR THEM TO HAVE IT IN THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT.    I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD ASSIST ME WITH THIS MATTER.
