It smelled horrible. I immediately called the dealer and Honda. The dealer made a diagnosis that the fuse burned but they cannot explain why or if it will happen again if it gets replaced. I am paying $496.62 to the dealer for repair but they cannot determine what cause it? I am very upset because my son is 2 years old and he seats in the rear. I am a single mother and I was dropping him to school when this happened. I don't imagine being exposes to fire or any safety hazard. The driver rear breake light was previously replaced on February of 2021. I found it strange and asked the dealer why is it being replaced too many time and just one side but they cannot explain why. I want an investigation or some kind of explanation why my vehicle catch fire. I dont know if Honda is manufacturing vehicles with faulty electric wire in the trunk causing fires and damages.

I AM NOT THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE THAT I AM REPORTING, BUT I WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A FIRE THAT THE VEHICLE CAUSED. MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN A PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE ON THE 1ST FLOOR. SEVERAL HOURS AFTER PARKING MY CAR, A BMW X5 PARKED NEXT TO MY VEHICLE. THE OWNER OF THE BMW LEFT THEIR VEHICLE AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. HOWEVER, WHILE THE OWNER WAS AWAY FROM THE CAR, THE VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE. THE FIRE SPREAD TO 4 OTHER VEHICLES INCLUDING MY VEHICLE ' THE TWO VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR AND TWO VEHICLES ON THE 2ND FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE. MY VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AS A RESULT OF THIS FIRE. THE FIRE ENGULFED THE PASSENGER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE AND COMPLETELY DAMAGED THE INTERIOR. WITH ALL THE DAMAGES THAT MY CAR SUSTAINED, IT IS NOT DRIVEABLE NOR IS IT REPAIRABLE. MY INSURANCE HAS A BETTER RECORD OF THE COMPLETE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. UPON, EXPLORING THIS ISSUE, I FOUND THAT THIS SPECIFIC BMW WAS LISTED AS AN AFFECTED VEHICLE FOR RECALL. NHTSA ISSUED SEVERAL RECALLS FOR PARTS OF THE VEHICLE THAT COULD CATCH FIRE EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN OPERATION. FOR EXAMPLE:   REPORT RECEIPT DATE: 10-30-2017  NHTSA CAMPAIGN: 17V683000  MANUFACTURER: BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC  CONSEQUENCE: AN ELECTRICAL SHORT CAN CAUSE THE PARTS WITHIN THE PCV VALVE TO MELT, INCREASING THE RISK OF A FIRE, EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS NOT IN USE.     THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND BMW SHOULD BE MORE ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AS A RESULT OF THIS, I HAVE LOST MY CAR AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOUP THE RETAIL VALUE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR AND BMW SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE AND HELP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.   THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.",

EITHER YOU ARE UNABLE, OR UNWILLING,  TO READ MY NOTES REGARDING THE HONDA CIVIC EX ([XXX]), DESTROYED IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN SEPTEMBER 2014.   THE AIR BAG - PASSENGER SIDE - EXPLODED IN A COLLISION AND TOOK OUT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.   MY AIR BAG - DRIVE SIDE - NEVER DEPLOYED!!    I WAS INJURED AND REQUIRED EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY.  I AM STILL IN PAIN FROM THE ACCIDENT.  EVERY DAY.     MY DOG, DAYZ, INSIDE A SAFETY-BELTED-INTO-PLACE DOG CARRIER, WAS INJURED.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE ACCIDENT, SHE BEGAN HAVING SEIZURES.  AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.  WE HAD TO PUT HER TO SLEEP AT THE END OF OCTOBER 2014.    I REPEATEDLY TRIED TO HAVE THE AIR BAGS REPLACED BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIPS WERE UNHELPFUL AND UNCOOPERATIVE. THEY ARE BY THE FAR AND AWAY THE ABSOLUTE WORST WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  THE WORD \"PROACTIVE\" HAS NEVER ENTERED INTO THEIR VOCABULARY.   IN FACT, I WOULD NOT PURCHASE A SECOND HONDA BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH MORONIC IDIOTS.    YOUR CARS MAY BE THE CREAM OF THE CROP IN JAPAN, BUT HERE IN THE USA, WE EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ACCOMPANY THE PURCHASE OF A CAR.   WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING IN ANY OF YOUR LOCAL DEALERSHIPS.     I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE OF A HONDA TO ANYONE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIPS.   PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME ANY MORE LITERATURE.  ABOUT TRADING IN MY CAR.  ABOUT A SAFETY RECALL. NOTHING.

I THOUGHT I SHOULD ACTIVATE THE 4-WAY FLASHERS AS A WARNING TO OTHER DRIVERS.  WHEN I PUSHED THE BUTTON, I PUSHED THE START/STOP BUTTON BY MISTAKE AND SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  THE START/STOP BUTTON IS JUST BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE FLASHER BUTTON IS ABOUT SIX INCHES TO THE LOWER RIGHT OF THE START/STOP BUTTON.      OF COURSE WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED I LOST POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKE BOOST.  IT WAS REALLY HARD TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AT THAT POINT.  THANKFULLY TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT.  THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND I CONTINUED TO COAST SLIGHTLY LEFT.     I ORDER TO RESTART THE ENGINE, I HAD TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL AND PUSH LIGHTLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.

I TURNED ON THE ENGINE AND TRIED TO MOVE THE CAR AGAIN. THIS HAPPENED 4 TIMES ON THE SAME DAY. NEXT DAY I CALLED THE CAR DEALER AND TOOK MY CAR FOR THE INSPECTION. THEY FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD A DEFECT AND IT HAD TO BE REPLACED. THEN ON 10/19/2014, WHEN I WAS DRIVING A STREET, I GOT A TIRE PRESSURE WARNING. MY HUSBAND HELPED TO ADD AIR TO THE TIRES, BUT THE WARNING SIGN DID NOT DISAPPEAR. ON 10/27/2014, WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE CAR IN THE AFTERNOON, A SERIES OF WARNINGS APPEARED (VSA, TPMS, EPS, ABS). AFTER HE GOT HOME, HE CALLED THE DEALER TO ASK FOR TOWING SERVICE TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AS HE DID NOT FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER NEXT MORNING.

ON SUNDAY MARCH 30, 2014 I HIT VERY BY ANOTHER CAR THAT RAN THE RED LIGHT. THE GALANT WAS GOING AT A SPEED OF 55 MPH WHEN IT HIT ME, THE FORCE WAS GREAT THAT THE CARS THEN SMACKED TOGETHER AND SPRANG OUT AGAIN. I NOTICE THAT THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY; SIDE OR EVEN FRONT.   I CALLED MY PARENTS. THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL ARRIVED. FIVE MINUTES LATER MY PARENTS ARRIVED. THE JSO AND FHP THEN IGNORED ME FOR 20 MINUTES, WHILE THEY TALKED WITH THE OTHER DRIVER.   DAMAGE WAS FRONT DRIVER SIDE WHEEL WAS BENT SLIGHTLY IN-WARD AT AN ANGLE, AXLE ROD AND STRUT SHOT, WHEEL WELL HAD DE-WELDED FROM THE MAIN BODY. CRUMPLED AROUND THE DRIVER SIDE WHEEL, DRIVER SIDE DOORS WHERE NOT DENTED BUT A SLIGHT WARP WAS IN THE DOORS SO THEY DID NOT COMPLETE TOP CLOSURE. REAR DRIVER SIDE LAMP AND BUMPER CRACKED/DETACHED. IN THE INTERIOR, THE CENTER CONSOLE WHERE THE GEAR SHIFT WAS HAD POPPED THE PLASTIC.    MY VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO PEARL COLLISION CENTER, WHO ESTIMATED THAT THEY COULD FIX THE DAMAGE. WHEN I QUESTIONED THIS, THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT TOTALED DUE TO DAMAGE WAS DEEMED 30% OF THE ACTUAL COST OF THE VEHICLE VALUE. I QUESTIONED WHY THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AND IF THEY WOULD BE CHECKED. I WAS HIT PRETTY HARD AND WHY HAVE AIR BAGS FOR SAFETY IF THEY DON''T WORK. I ALSO QUESTIONED THE TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE. STATE FARM WOULD NOT ANSWER MY QUESTIONS OR WOULD AMERICA HONDA ABOUT THOROUGHLY CHECKING THE AIR BAGS.

I AM HEARTBROKEN, ANGRY AND IN PAIN.  AFTER MY FIRST 30 MINUTE DRIVE IN THIS CAR, I RESEARCHED ONLINE THIS ISSUE AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM DUE TO THE NEW HEAD RESTRAINT REGULATIONS.  I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE SIGNED A 3 YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS AGREEING TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS OF PAIN.    I'VE TRIED ADJUSTING THE SEAT HEIGHT, ADJUSTING THE TILT OF THE SEAT AND THE HEADREST HEIGHT IN EVERY COMBINATION I CAN THINK OF AND ALL I CAN ACHIEVE IS A BARELY TOLERABLE DRIVING POSITION WHERE I CAN BARELY SEE OVER THE DASHBOARD AND THE HEADREST IS RAISED HIGH ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T TOUCH MY HEAD - NOR PROTECT IT AS DESIGNED.   I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MAINLY AN ISSUE WITH PASSIVE HEADRESTS AND THAT THE ACTIVE HEADRESTS ARE A BETTER DESIGN THAT STAY OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SPACE.   MY ONLY OPTION WILL BE TO REVERSE THE HEADREST FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND HOPE MY CAR ISN'T REAR ENDED.  ALTHOUGH HAVING MY NEW CAR TOTALED WOULD BE A BLESSING BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND A VEHICLE TO DRIVE THAT DOESN'T HURT ME PHYSICALLY.    I SEE THAT THESE FORWARD TILTING HEADREST COMPLAINTS ONLINE GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2008 WHEN THE NEW REGULATIONS CAME OUT THAT FORCED CAR MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE VEHICLES THAT TORTURE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AMERICANS EVERY YEAR.  I WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID $200 OR $300 MORE FOR AN ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEM THAT STAYED OUT OF MY WAY.  THE NHTSA SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR THEIR DISGUSTING CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SUFFER EVERY DAY DUE TO THESE GOVERNMENT-REQUIRED HEADRESTS FORCING THEIR NECKS AND SPINES INTO UNNATURAL AND PAINFUL POSITIONS.    *JS",
