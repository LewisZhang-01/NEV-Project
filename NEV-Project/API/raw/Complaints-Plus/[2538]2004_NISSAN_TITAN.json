Also about my shifter I'm not sure if this applies but I have the shifter you can switch to manual (I've never switch to manual bc I don't know how to drive manual) but I have an issue with it just in automatic sometimes when I shift from park to drive it doesn't seem to switch from park to drive and the vehicle stays in the parked position while the shift is in drive and I have to shift back to park wait a second and then shift back into drive a second time before I get the truck into driving mode.

I HAVE SEEN THE AXLE REMOVED AND RUST PITS FORM UNDER THE SEAL CAUSING THE LEAK. IT IS AS THOUGH THE METAL USED IS FROM CHINA. *TR",

ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR VEHICLE GOES INTO LIMP MODE - IT WON'T REV OVER 1000 RPM.   YOU LOOK TO PULL OVER BUT THERE IS ONLY A SMALL SHOULDER.   VEHICLES ARE SKIDDING TRYING TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT AS YOUR VEHICLE IS DISABLED AND ONLY PARTIALLY OFF THE ROAD.    AFTER FIXING THE PROBLEM, I REALIZED THE TRUCK SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO LIMP MODE.  IT IS A CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW WITH THE VEHICLE.  I WAS PUT IN HARMS WAY FOR NO REASON.    ALL VEHICLES USE TO HAVE THE ENGINE SPEED CONTROLLED VIA MECHANICAL LINKAGE OR CABLES FOR THE GAS PEDAL. VERY FEW FAILURES EXISTED WITH THIS DESIGN.  TODAY GAS PEDAL RUN BY A WIRE THAT SENDS AN ELECTRONIC SIGNAL TO THE VEHICLES COMPUTER.  THE COMPUTER IN TURN EVALUATES THE GAS PEDAL POSITION WHICH THEN SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE FUEL INJECTORS AND THROTTLE BODY TO CONTROL THE ENGINE.    THE CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW COMES INTO PLAY WHEN VEHICLE DESIGNERS COMBINE OTHER ELECTRONIC SENSORS ON THE SAME CIRCUIT AS THE GAS PEDAL.  NON-CRITICAL COMPONENTS LIKE GAS EVAPORATOR SENSORS, POWER STEERING SENSORS, AIR CONDITIONER SENSORS.  WHEN ANY OF THESE NON-CRITICAL ITEMS EXPERIENCE AN ELECTRICAL SHORT, THE VEHICLE GOES INTO LIMP MODE POTENTIALLY PUTTING DRIVERS IN HARM'S WAY  DOES THIS RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FIX ALL PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE GAS PEDAL?  NO IT DOES NOT. IT IS A LOT SAFER.  I BELIEVE NHTSA SHOULD EVALUATE & ASSESS THIS CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW.  I HAVE BEEN A CONTROLS ENGINEER FOR 28 YRS AND THIS DESIGN IS NOT SAFE.

WIRES FOR THE REAR AUDIO SPEAKERS ARE ALSO CONTAINED N THE HARNESS.    CONSEQUENCE: IF THE WIRES FOR THE SEAT BELTS AND SPEAKER WIRES BREAK AND MAKE CONTACT, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRETENSIONER MAY DEPLOY. IF THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE SEAT BELT IS RETRACTED, IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO USE THE SEAT BELT. IF ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE RIGHT SIDE HARNESS FOR THE SEAT BELT TENSION SENSOR BREAKS, THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY AS DESIGNED IN A FRONTAL COLLISION INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH AND PERSONAL INJURY.    I WENT TO WALLACE NISSAN, KINGSPORT, TN, ON 07/18/2012 AND DESCRIBED THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROBLEM, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAD ENDED AND THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR THIS PROBLEM, I EXPLAINED THAT THE DOME LIGHTS AND THE DOOR LOCK WERE EFFECTED BY THIS FLAWED DESIGN PROBLEM,.    I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT THE BROKEN WIRES WILL SHORT OUT AND START A FIRE.  *TR",

WHEN MY TRUCK WAS TOWED TO THE SHOP THEY SAID THE REAR END ACTUALLY GAVE WAY AND BROKE, INCLUDING THE DRIVE SHAFT WHICH SNAPPED INTO TWO PIECES, ONE OF WHICH WAS LAUNCHED INTO TRAFFIC.  LUCKILY NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED NOR PEOPLE HURT.  THE MECHANICS SAID THEY'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR 57 YEARS AND I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE COME OUT OF THAT THE WAY I DID, BECAUSE IN MOST CASES THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE FLIPPED AND ROLLED.  THE DAMAGES WERE EXTENSIVE AND EXTREME FOR SOMETHING I HAD NO CONTROL OVER.  THE SHOP INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY I WAS DRIVING IT OR ANYTHING I COULD HAVE DONE, AND THEY FOUND IT \"WEIRD\" THAT IT HAPPENED THE WAY IT DID.  VERY DANGEROUS AND NEAR TRAUMATIZING. I WAS UNABLE TO SELECT THE CORRECT COMPONENTS ABOVE SO I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH MY DRIVE SHAFT, REAR DIFFERENTIAL, AND POWER LINE.  *TR",

I AM THE 2ND OWNER AND BOUGHT IT FROM A GUY WHO BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW IN 2004 AND TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF IT. THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 55K MILES. JUST LAST WEEKEND, 6/19/2011, IT STARTED MAKING BANGING AND GRINDING NOISES IN THE BACK WHEEL. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT I RAN OVER SOMETHING AND IT WAS STUCK IN THE BACK WHEELS. AFTER EXAMINING THE REAR WHEEL AREA AND THE BRAKE PADS, EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL. HOWEVER, THE NOISE GOT LOUDER AND LOUDER. IT SOUNDED LIKE I WAS DRAGGING A REFRIGERATOR. I FELT A STUTTER IN THE VEHICLE AND IT STARTED TO STRUGGLE TO GO WHEN I WOULD PUT THE TRUCK INTO DRIVE. I ASSUMED THE BRAKE CALIPERS MAY HAVE BEEN JAMMED AND BROUGHT IT INTO AN AUTO SERVICE CENTER TO BE EXAMINED. ABOUT 2 HOURS LATER, I WENT BACK TO THE SHOP AND THE TECHNICIAN TOOK ME TO GO SEE THE PROBLEM. THEY EXAMINED THE REAR BRAKES AND DIFFERENTIAL AND FOUND NUMEROUS LARGE CHUNKS OF BROKEN METAL INSIDE, WHICH SHE SAID WERE PIECES OF SHOES, HARDWARE, AND GEARS. THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL AND THAT THE GEAR DAMAGE HAD LIKELY CAUSED A CHAIN REACTION DAMAGING THE ENTIRE LEFT REAR AXLE ASSEMBLY AND E-BRAKES. THE REAR AXLE SEALS WERE LEAKING TOO ONTO THE WHEELS. ALL THESE PARTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH THE REAR AXLE. THE SERVICE SHOP QUOTED ME $3800 TO GET THIS FIXED! I WAS IN SHOCK AS I JUST BOUGHT THE TRUCK. OF COURSE, I COULD NO LONGER DRIVE THE TRUCK EITHER AS IT WAS IN PIECES AND NOT DRIVABLE. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DON'T HAVE THIS MONEY. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TELL THE SERVICE SHOP TO GO AHEAD WITH THE REPAIRS AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO PUT IT ON A CREDIT CARD.   I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND WENT ON TO SEVERAL INTERNET SITES FOR NISSAN TITAN OWNERS TO SEE IF OTHERS WERE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS OR IF THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS. AFTER READING PAGES OF ENTRIES POSTED BY OTHER TITAN OWNERS, I FOUND OUT I WAS NOT ALONE. NISSAN NEEDS TO HELP PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS! *KB",

I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN ON THIS MATTER AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO LET MY INSURANCE DEAL WITH IT, WHICH I EXPLAINED ABOVE HOW THAT DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.          I FEEL LIKE THIS IS NISSANS FAULT AND THEY SHOULD HELP ME BUT THEY ARE NOT. APPARENTLY I NEED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY THAT DEALS WITH FIRE AND I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE, WHICH I CAN NOT AFFORD. I TOLD NISSAN I HAD THE VIDEO BUT THEY DID NOT CARE. YOU WOULD THINK AFTER ALL THE TOYOTA INCIDENTS THAT THEY MAY HELP ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD THE VIDEO OF PROOF AND THEY DID NOT . I HAVE SENT THE VIDEO AND ALL PICTURES I HAVE TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY AS WELL BUT ALL THEY WILL PROBABLY GET IS THE MONEY THEY PAID FOR LOAN. SO MY INSURANCE COMPANY IS COVERED BUT I'M LEFT OUT TO DRY.   PLEASE READ THIS PART.    THE FIRE INSPECTOR FOR MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT FIRE INSPECTOR HAVE CONCLUDED IT WAS THE BCM ( BODY CONTROL MODULE).    NISSAN KNEW OF THE PROBLEM BUT JUST SENT OUT SERVICE LETTERS AND NOT RECALLS. MY INSURANCE WILL BE PURSUING NISSAN AS WELL ! *TR",

SHE CAME TO A STOP AND THE TRUCK RESTARTED IMMEDIATELY.     ON FEB 26TH, 2010 MY WIFE WAS AT A FRIENDS HOUSE AND THE TRUCK WOULD NOT START.  SHE HAD GIVEN ME THE WRONG DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRUCK I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A DEAD BATTERY.  SO I JUMP STARTED THE TRUCK AND IT FIRED RIGHT UP SO I REPLACED THE BATTERY.      ON FEB 27TH, 2010 MY WIFE AND I WERE SITTING AT A STOPLIGHT AND THE TRUCK'S ENGINE JUST SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING.  THE ENGINE WOULD NOT RESTART AND THIS CAUSED A MAJOR TRAFFIC JAM AND WE WERE ALMOST HIT MY MULTIPLE VEHICLES.  LUCKILY A COUPLE BYSTANDERS HELPED DIRECT TRAFFIC AND HELPED PUSH THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD.  THE TRUCK WOULD NOT START AND NOTHING ELSE WAS VISIBLY WRONG SUCH AS BATTERY OR ANY OTHER COMMON ITEMS.  AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THE TRUCK STARTED RIGHT UP WITH NO PROBLEMS.       AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ONLINE THROUGH MULTIPLE NISSAN TITAN FORUMS IT CAME TOP MY ATTENTION THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT BY OWNERS FOR SOME TIME.  THE INTELLIGENT POWER DISTRIBUTION MODULE (IPDM) IN THE TRUCK WERE FAULTING CAUSING THE ECM RELAY ON THE TRUCK TO STOP WORKING.  THE SHORT TERM FIX FOR THIS WAS TO REPLACE THE RELAY.  THE LONG TERM FIX FOR THIS IS TO REPLACE THE IPDM.  SO I REPLACED THE IPDM AND HAVE NOT SEEN A PROBLEM SINCE.    WHEN I WENT TO THE PARTS COUNTER AT KORUM NISSAN IN PUYALLUP TO PICK UP MY $178 PART I ASKED HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ORDERED THIS PART. I WAS TOLD BY THERE PARTS REP MIKE THAT HE HAS SOLD A LOT OF THESE UNITS FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  HE SAID IT WAS A COMMON KNOWN ISSUE BY THE PARTS REPS AND THE SERVICE REPS.    WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW SUCH A THING COULD BE KNOWN SO WELL BUT NO SAFETY RECALL HAS HAPPENED.

THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE RECALLED TO BE FIXED AT NISSANS EXPENSE. ONE TIME THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SOMEONE'S BRAKE ARE GOING TO FAIL FROM THE OIL AND CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT RESULTING IN INJURY OR DEATH! SOMETHING NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE ITS TO LATE. *TR",

WHEN I TOOK IT IN FOR THE REPAIR, THE THIRD REPAIR, THE HAD COME UP WITH ANOTHER FIX THEY SAID AND IT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. I DID NOTICE THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL FELT FUNNY. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT, BUT IT ALMOST FELT LIKE IT WAS APPLYING MORE PRESSURE TO THE REAR BRAKES TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE FRONT END. ANYWAY, SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE A COMPANY VEHICLE AND I HAVE ONLY PUT 16K MILES ON THE TRUCK AND THE FRONT END IS SHAKING AGAIN WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES. THE MORE THE SPEED AND THE HARDER  YOU APPLY THE BRAKES THE MORE IT SHAKES. ALSO, I NOTICED THAT WHEN THE BRAKES WERE SHAKING THE FRONT END TO SHAKE, SOMETHING IN THE FRONT END POPS, LIKE  WHEN YOU TOP A HILL. IT HAS GONE AWAY EVERY TIME THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE BRAKES, BUT WHEN THE SHAKING STARTS BACK SO DOES THE POPPING. I'M NOT TO CONCERNED ABOUT THE POPPING, BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SHAKING. THE LAST THING, TWO OF THE THREE TIMES THEY ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE BRAKES, THEY HAVE ALSO TURNED THE ROTORS. ROTORS CAN ONLY BE TURN A COUPLE OF TIMES AND HAVE TO BE REPLACED. I FEEL THEY CHEAPED OUT ON THE REPAIR BY PATCHING THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF REPAIRING THE PROBLEM. I WISH YOU GUYS WOULD LOOK INTO IT.

IN THE FOLLOWING MONTH OF MAY AFTER RETURNING FROM A TRIP I FOUND OIL BELOW THE RIGHT AXEL.  AGAIN I TOOK IT TO MY DEALERSHIP.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE HOSE FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND THE HIGH PRESSURE HOSE FOR THE POWER STEERING WAS BOTH LEAKING.  THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE HOSE BRACKETS ON THAT MODEL WERE BAD AND THAT ALONG WITH NEW HOSES HE PUT ON THE NEW TYPE OF BRACKETS.  HE DIDN'T SAY WHY THE HOSES LEAKED OTHER THAN \"YOU KNOW THE TRUCK IS FIVE YEARS OLD.\"  BY THE WAY THE COST FOR THAT REPAIR $859.00. SO IN THE SPAN OF 30 DAYS I HAVE SPENT OVER $1300.00 TO HAVE ALL OF THE HIGH PRESSURE HOSES REPLACED.

SHE WAS EXITING A PARKING LOT TO A BUSY ROAD. AS SHE APPROACHED THE END OF THE PARKING LOT, SHE BRAKED TO WAIT FOR A CLEARING IN TRAFFIC. SHE SAID THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR, THE TRUCK MADE A LOUD RUMBLING NOISE, AND THE TRUCK ROLLED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE BUSY STREET UNTIL SHE PUMPED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND STOPPED THE TRUCK. SHE LEFT IT THERE AND WAITED FOR ME, AFRAID TO MOVE IT. I INSPECTED THE TRUCK AND FOUND NO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. I FIGURED THAT THERE WAS A FAULT WITH THE ABS SYSTEM, WHICH WENT AWAY AFTER THE TRUCK WAS TURNED OFF AND THE SYSTEM WAS REBOOTED/SELF TESTED. ON AUGUST 22, 2008, THE FAULT RETURNED. MY WIFE BACKED THE TRUCK OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY, AND THE TRUCK DISPLAYED THE SAME SYMPTOMS WHEN SHE TRIED TO STOP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVEWAY. SHE AVOIDED HITTING A PARKED VEHICLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. SHE LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING SO AS TO NOT RESET THE ABS COMPUTER, AND CALLED ME OUT TO CHECK THE TRUCK. I COULD FIND NO MECHANICAL FAULT, AND FOUND THE ABS FULLY ENGAGING WHEN PRESSING THE BRAKES, RESULTING IN VERY LITTLE STOPPING POWER. PUMPING THE BRAKES CAUSE NEAR FULL APPLICATION OF BRAKING FORCE, EVEN AT LIGHT PEDAL PRESSURE.  I DETERMINED THAT IT WAS AN ABS ISSUE. BOTH TIMES THE FAULT OCCURRED, THE \"BRAKE\" LIGHT ILLUMINATED. TURNING OFF THE TRUCK AND RESTARTING RESOLVED THE PROBLEM, CONFIRMING MY SUSPICION OF A SOFTWARE FAULT. I SEARCHED ON LINE AND FOUND A NISSAN TSB THAT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE. I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO DIRITO BROTHERS NISSAN IN CONCORD, CA TO HAVE THE TSB APPLIED, WHICH INVOLVED A ABS SOFTWARE UPDATE. I WAS SURPRISED AND UPSET TO LEARN THAT THE REPAIR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, AS THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS CONSIDERED AN \"ADJUSTMENT.\" I WAS CHARGED $150 FOR THIS SERVICE.

I TOOK IT TO A NISSAN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT A LOW SPEED MISFIRE WAS THE ONLY CODE IN THE MEMORY AND THEY FELT THE PROBLEM WITH THE RPM WAS THE FUEL PUMP AS THEY HAD ALREADY REPLACED TWO 04 TITAN FUEL PUMPS.

I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER NISSAN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE FUEL PUMP WAS ONLY PUTTING OUT 34 PSI AT IDLE AND SHOULD BE 60.  THEY ALSO SAID BECAUSE OF THE LOW FUEL PRESSURE THAT BOTH OF THE FRONT CONVERTERS WERE DAMAGED AND WERE NOW FAILING. THEY TOO STATED THEY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE 04 FUEL PUMPS.

MY PROBLEM SURFACED BEFORE THE 36 MONTH/ UNLIMITED MILEAGE LIMITATION, BUT I DID  NOT UTILIZE THE WARRANTY COVERAGE BECAUSE MY SITUATION DID NOT FIT THE DEFINITION.

SINCE I HAD EXCEEDED THE 36 MONTH LIMIT BY 90 DAYS, I ELECTED TO LET THE LOCAL INDEPENDENT TIRE DEALER INSTALL THE NISSAN PARTS. HE WAS CORRECT!  PROBLEM SOLVED (AT LEAST FOR NOW).  I CALLED NISSANS CONSUMER AFFAIRS LINE TO COMPLAIN, AND TO LET THEM KNOW THAT I FELT THAT A SAFETY RECALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME SAFETY IMPLICATIONS INVOLVED--AND NOT THE COMPANY COST SAVING MEASURES OF A COUPLE OF TSBS AND A FEEBLY MODIFIED BASIC AUTO WARRANTY.

THE TRUCK CAUSED ME TO STOP IN TRAFFIC, LUCKILY NO ACCIDENT HAPPENED, THE TRUCK WAS ABLE TO CATCH SOME TEETH IN THE DIFFERENTIAL TO PULL ME OFF THE ROAD.  THE FIRST FAILURE HAPPENED AT 8000 MILES ABOUT MARCH 2005, THE SECOND AT 19000 NOVEMBER 2005, JUST RECENTLY I DECIDED NOT TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD A QUICK LUBE CHECK MY DIFFERENTIAL OIL.  IT WAS BLACK AND HAD QUARTER SIZED CHUNKS OF METAL ON THE PLUG.  THIS MEANS THE DIFFERENTIAL IS ABOUT TO FAIL.  WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM ON A WINDING ROAD IN A CANYON, WHICH I HAVE TO GO THROUGH OFTEN.  I COULD DIE OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE IF THIS UNSAFE TRUCK FAILS IN A BLIND CORNER OR BEND.  AT THE SECOND FAILURE THE DEALERSHIP MADE ME SIGN A WAIVER STATING THAT THEY WOULD NOT FIX MY DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD IT FAIL AGAIN.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE THIRD POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE AND THEY SIMPLY SAID CALL NISSAN.  I HAVE NO ONE TO TURN TO, MY TRUCK IS CONSTANTLY BREAKING DOWN.  THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP ME.  MY BRAKES HAVE BEEN WORKED ON THREE TIMES, BOTH TIMES OF DIFFERENTIAL FAILURE THE TRUCK WAS IN THE SHOP FOR A MONTH, I HAVE OWNED THE TRUCK FOR ONE YEAR AND CURRENTLY HAVE 29000 MILES.    NISSAN HAS A BAD PART IN THEIR TRUCKS, PLEASE INVESTIGATE, THERE ARE MANY OTHERS, ALL I CAN DO IS SUGGEST THEY REPORT THEIR PROBLEMS HERE ALSO, PERHAPS THAT WILL HELP.    *JB",

THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED DEFECT IN MY SWITCH, RATHER A DESIGN DEFECT OF ALL TITAN SWITCHES AS I HAVE LOOKED AT OTHER NEW ONES ON THE NISSAN DEALER'S LOT.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ON-OFF TWIST KNOB IS LOCATED AT THE END OF THE TURN SIGNAL SWITCH SO WHEN YOU EITHER TURN THE TURN SIGNAL ON OR FLIP THE SWITCH FORWARD OR BACK WITH YOUR FINGERS TO CHANGE THE LIGHTS FROM BRIGHT TO DIM THE SWITCH IS VERY EASY TO TURN OFF BY ACCIDENT.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS ON A DARK ROAD IT IS VERY ALARMING AND I FEEL MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  THE TWIST KNOB IS SO LARGE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SWITCHES OF THIS TYPE THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE TO ACCIDENTLY TWIST IT IF YOU DONT GRAP IT EXACTLY IN THE CENTER.
