RV WAS TAKEN TO SERVICE CENTER WHEN THEY FOUND THE LUG NUT HOLDING THE WHEEL ON ALMOST OFF. DEXTER HAS REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE TIRE AND REPAIR BUT HAS SAID THEY WILL SHIP A NEW AXLE FOR ME TO HAVE INSTALLED. THEY SAID PUTTING A NEW TIRE ON THE OLD AXLE WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM BUT THE NEW AXLE WILL BUT THEY STILL REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. THEY HAVE HAD A RECALL FOR THE SAME ISSUE ON THE SAME POUND AXLE BEFORE. THIS IS YOUR CASE NUMBER 17V-248. WE HAD BEEN TRAVELING WITH OUR GRANDSON WHEN WE STOPPED AT AN RV PARK AND THE TIRE WAS NOTICED. WE HAD AAA ROADSIDE CHANGE THE TIRE NOT KNOWING IT WAS AN AXLE ISSUE.",
