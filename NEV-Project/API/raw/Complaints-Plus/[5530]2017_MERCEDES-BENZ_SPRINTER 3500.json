MY LOCAL SHOP CONFIRMED THE SAME ISSUE WITH A WELD/CRACK ON THE INSIDE OF THE RIM ON MAY 29, 2019. I HAD TO REPLACE THAT RIM ALSO. BOTH TIMES I NOTICED THE FLAT TIRES AFTER PARKING THE VEHICLE UPON RETURNING FROM LONG ROAD TRIPS. ON THE SECOND WHEEL REPLACEMENT, I WAS SHOWN WHERE THE LEAK WAS DETECTED WHICH WAS AT THE CORNER OF THE INSIDE WELD SPOT. THERE ARE 8 WELD SPOTS ON THE INSIDE OF EACH RIM. EACH TIME THERE WAS AIR LEAKING AT THE SITE OF A WELD SPOT. I CALLED MY LOCAL MERCEDES BENZ DEALERSHIP TO INQUIRE IF THERE WAS A REPORTED ISSUE FROM THE FACTORY AND WAS TOLD NO. I THEN CALLED MY MOTOR HOME DEALERSHIP WITH THE SAME INQUIRY AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AWARE OF ANY SUCH ISSUE.",

I PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE DATES AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF 3 WHEEL (RIMS) FAILURES DUE TO A CRACKED WELD WHERE THE TWO PIECES OF THE RIM ARE JOINED, CAUSING AIR TO LEAK AND TIRES TO DEFLATE.  ON APRIL 12, 2019, I HAD ANOTHER FLAT TIRE DUE TO THE SAME REASONS AS STATED IN MY PREVIOUS REPORT, A WELD IN THE RIM THAT FAILED TO HOLD AIR.  THUS FAR, FOUR OF THE SEVEN WHEELS/RIMS ON MY VEHICLE HAVE FAILED OVER AN 8 MONTH PERIOD AND 6500 MILES.  DURING MOST OF THIS PERIOD THE VEHICLE WAS IN STORAGE.  I DISCOVERED ALL THE PROBLEMS DURING MORNING AIR PRESSURE CHECKS AFTER DRIVING THE PREVIOUS DAY.  I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED TO THE TIRES WHEN THEY WERE AT 61PSI AT THE START OF ONE DAY AND AT 30PSI THE NEXT MORNING AFTER A 400 PLUS MILE DRIVING DAY.  THEY WERE ALL SLOW LEAKS THAT MANIFESTED THEMSELVES AFTER A DAY OF DRIVING.  THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW IN NOVEMBER, 2018.  IT IS A 2018 WINNEBAGO VIEW ON A 2017 SPRINTER CHASSIS.",
