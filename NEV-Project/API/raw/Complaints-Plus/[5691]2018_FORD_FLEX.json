I believe around Sept 14th 2020.   6 days after warranty expiration the Sync3 hands-free system died on my Flex. I only had 32000 miles at that time.   It was touted as a great safety feature when I purchased the car brand new. I live in Branson Mo where every road is curvy and drops off into ravines. The system is totally inoperable.   Called Ford 800 number, they checked and told me they would not do anything with it.  Talked to the local dealer and they said they only get so much goodwill money from Ford each year and since I didn't buy it from them they were not going to do anything.  I used to live 8 hours north.  Say it needs an APIM module.  Well a couple months after that went out my backup camera fails to work about 20 percent of the time.  DIstorted wavy screen, can't see anything.   2 safety features that are a joke when they don't work. Ford has multiple recalls on different years for the same systems.  I am available to contact and inspect the car at any time.",

On 7-30-21, I had the broken part on right rear replaced  and the Left rear part was loose and replaced also.  As far as safety goes,  it had to be towed to shop to get off the road, and could not drive.  On 6-17-21, I took my car to Tom Holzer Ford in Farmington Hills, MI, to be inspected, because I was hearing a clunking noise on the right back side of the vehicle.  After the serviceman at Tom Holzer test drove the car, They informed me the steering and suspension were okay. I have the paperwork stating it was okay.  I have been leasing this car for 3 years and was now going to buy the car after my lease was done.  I took it in to make sure, if there was a problem, it would be taken care of under 3 year warranty. I purchased the Flex on 7-19-21.  And On 7-28-21, the Toe Link broke.  I was not told that I should have taken it to a Ford Dealer, if something broke.  But I did ask my Salesman, at the time I bought the car, if they would take care of the problem, if something broke in the near future.  He said to contact him, and he would see what would they could do.  I had to pay $95.00, to tow it 5 miles, to White Lake Auto Repair, which is 1 mile from my house.  The total of the repair was $485.00,  completed on 7-30-21.  The service manager, at Tom Holzer, said Ford will not reimburse me. He said I should have brought the car to their dealership. My Husband worked for Ford for 42 years.  We have been a loyal Ford family all these years, and have never had a problem like this.  Being that I had the car checked out before the 3 year warranty, and the service department said it was okay, I feel I should be reimbursed for the repair, whether I took it to them, or to a Repair shop near my home, which we totally trust.  Also, there were no warning lights or messages that came on in the car.",

DUE TO COMPLETE LACK OF STEERING, THE CAR WAS AN IMMEDIATE DANGER TO DRIVE AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET SAFELY OFF THE ROAD, BUT MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO DO SO. HE WAS LUCKY TO AVOID A MAJOR COLLISION.     THE NEXT DAY WE CALLED FOR THE CAR TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR WITHOUT ANY ISSUE. WITH EXTREME MANUAL FORCE APPLIED, THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER WAS BARELY ABLE TO TURN THE CAR ENOUGH IN ORDER TO GET IT ONTO THE TOW TRUCK. ONCE THE CAR WAS RECEIVED BY THE DEALER, THE SERVICE ASSOCIATE CONFIRMED THIS 'STEERING FAILURE' WAS A PROBLEM THEY HAD SEEN COME UP A FEW TIMES IN THE PRIOR WEEKS WITH OTHER FORD MAKES AND MODELS. THEY SAID IT WAS A COSTLY REPAIR AND I SHOULD BE LUCKY BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THE EXTENDED FORD WARRANTY PROGRAM AND THEY WOULD CALL ME LATER TO CONFIRM AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC WAS COMPLETED. LATER THAT DAY THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THEIR DIAGNOSTICS CONFIRMED THE STEERING FAILURE, THAT IT WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY AND MAY TAKE A FEW DAYS AS A MAJOR REPAIR FOR THE STEERING SYSTEM. 3 DAYS LATER, THEY DENIED ANY STEERING FAILURE, AND CLAIMED IT WAS A FAILED BATTERY INSTEAD. DESPITE OUR COMPLAINT, THEY CHARGED US $500 FOR A NEW ONE.    AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, WE SOLD THE CAR (AS A DEATH TRAP), CANCELLED OUR FORD EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SOLD ALL OF OUR FORD STOCK.
