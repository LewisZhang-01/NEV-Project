THE LAST FAILURE NEARLY RESULTED IN MY DEATH, WHEN I LOST POWER ON THE HIGHWAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A SEMI TRACTOR TRAILER. AS SOON AS I REPORTED THE FAILURE, THE AMERICAN IRONHORSE WARRANTY DIVISION HAD THE BIKE TRANSPORTED TO AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER, WHO WAS UNABLE TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM. WHEN THE FAILURE HAPPENED AGAIN, THE WARRANTY DIVISION SENT A TRUCK TO PICK UP THE MOTORCYCLE AND RETURN IT TO THE AMERICAN IRONHORSE FACTORY IN TEXAS. THE FACTORY WAS ALSO UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE OR CORRECT THE SPORADIC ENGINE FAILURES. WHEN I RECEIVED MY MOTORCYCLE BACK THIS TIME, THE ENGINE FAILURE REPEATED ITSELF AGAIN, WHEN I WAS DRIVING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE SEMI.  I DO NOT KNOW IF OTHER 2004 SLAMMERS HAVE REPORTED THIS SAME FAILURE OR NOT, BUT I AM WAITING DIRECTION FROM THE WARRANY DIVISION ONCE AGAIN.",
