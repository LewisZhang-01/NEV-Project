Thank God my son was with me he helped me get onto the first exit off the highway while other cars were speeding by. The next day I looked on the internet for any other people who had the same problem and I found out about the recall, called Chevrolet and spoke to the information about the recall and was told that the original owner had the work done and I was not eligible for any kind of help. The car now has 63000 miles on it after me buying it in June of 2020 with around45,000.have a car fax report given at time of sale shows no recall imfo,at all.I am a senior citizen getting not enough money to pay my bills and am on assistance from the government for.. I need help and am starting with you. I would like to know how long the parts were warranted because in 2014 the original owner had35000 miles on the car so that would make the part only lasting less than 30,000 miles,I love this car and it is the first one that I have ever given a name, though it might sound a little weird, oh well to each their own. I looked up the part on a well-known internet site and as electronic power steering assist module runs close to 300.00 and that does not include labor and god knows what else.",

I WAS TOLD IT ISN'T UNDER WARRANTY, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE RESEARCH I'VE DONE, I THOUGHT AS LONG AS THE PART WAS IN STOCK IT CAN BE REPLACED.  A REPRESENTATIVE WAS TRYING TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT ISN'T, DUE TO THIS BEING A SAFETY ISSUE.  I'M CONFUSE  WHEN CERTAIN MALIBU'S HAD THIS RECALL, WHY ALL OF THEM WEREN'T AT LEAST CHECKED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THE CAR IS OLD, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT IT'S MINE AND IT'S ALL I HAVE AND I HAVE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF THE CAR AND IT HAS TAKEN CARE OF ME, NOT ONLY THAT I CAN'T AFFORD A NEW CAR WITH A PART-TIME JOB.  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ MY COMPLAINT.",

THE MAJORITY OF THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY LOSS OF POWER STEERING, USUALLY DURING ACCELERATION, FOLLOWED BY AN AUDIBLE, MULTI-NOTE CHIME, AND THE WORDS \"POWER STEERING\" DISPLAYED ON MY RADIO DATA DISPLAY.  THIS OCCURRED ALMOST EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN BOTH GM RECALLS #14116 & 10183.      FROM RECALL #14116:  \"THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER FOR THIS RECALL IS 14V153.\"  GM HAS DENIED MY CLAIMS CONTENDING THEY ONLY HAVE TO FIX IT IF THE ISSUE RETURNS IMMEDIATELY, EVEN THOUGH IT TOOK THEM 8 YEARS TO ISSUE A RECALL.  I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE HAS NEVER BEEN SATISFACTORILY REMEDIED AND I AM HOPING YOU CAN HELP ME RESOLVE THE ISSUE WITHOUT FURTHER DANGER AND COST TO ME.         HISTORY:  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED NEW IN 3/2016 AND TO THE BEST OF KNOWLEDGE, THE ISSUE STARTED WITHIN 3 TO 6 MONTHS OF PURCHASE.  IT WAS ANNOYING, BUT INITIALLY OCCURRED SO INFREQUENTLY AND RANDOMLY THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH FIXING.  IT WAS REPAIRED AT ABOUT 55,000 MILES (10/2012) B/C OF RECALL 10183.  THE ISSUE WENT AWAY FOR A WHILE, BUT RETURNED AND WAS REPAIRED AGAIN AT ABOUT 88,000 MILES (4/2015).  AGAIN IT WENT AWAY AND RETURNED AT ABOUT 2/2016 & 105,000 MILES.  IT BECAME VERY DANGEROUS FOR A WHILE, BUT WENT AWAY WITHOUT REPAIR.  THE ISSUE HAS RETURNED AGAIN IN 1/2017 AT ABOUT 132,000 MILES AND HAS LEFT ME ALMOST COMPLETELY WITHOUT EPS.    ISSUE SPECIFICS:  THE PROBLEM STARTED AS TEMP. LOSS OF EPS DURING ACCELERATION FOLLOWED BY CHIMES & A \"POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE.  IT ADVANCED TO INCLUDE LOSS OF EPS DURING ACCELERATION AROUND CORNERS (EX: ON RAMPS) AND THE EPS TRYING TO FORCEFULLY STRAIGHTEN THE STEERING WHEEL STRAIGHT WHILE CORNERING.  NOW, I EITHER DO NOT HAVE POWER STEERING AT STARTUP, HAVE A SHAKING STEERING WHEEL OR LOSE EPS DURING TRIPS.",

I KNOW THEY WILL G OUT SOMETIMES, BUT HOW OFTEN MINES GOES OUT IS NOT NORMAL. THE AIRBAG ICON ON MY DASHBOARD AS WELL AS THE READING ON MY SCREEN SHOWS THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY AIRBAG. I'M AFRAID THAT ONE DAY IT WILL JUST EXPLODE IN MY FACE. I ALSO HAVE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH MY WINDOWS AND LIGHTS IN MY CAR. THE WINDOWS GET STUCK AND ONLY ONE LIGHT IN MY CAR WORKS (ONE OF THE OVERHEAD LIGHTS). I HAD MY TRANSMISSION CHECKED OUT AND THEY INFORMED ME THERE WAS NO PROBLEM (BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT ABOUT ME POWER STEERING) AND I END UP PAYING TO GET MY SOLENOIDS REPLACED, BUT I WAS NOT REIMBURSED WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN FOR THE TRANSMISSION RECALL.

I ENDED UP PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST $1700.00 TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN AND STEERING MOTOR.

I DID GET THE STEERING TORQUE SENSOR RECALL FIXED BUT MY STEERING WAS STILL MESSED UP. THIS RECALL DID NOT FIX MY VERY SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ISSUE. IT WAS ONLY AFTER I AUTHORIZED THE STEERING COLUMN AND MOTOR REPAIRS THAT THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. GM CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE SAME EXACT ISSUE AS THE GM RECALL FOR OTHER MALIBU'S, BECAUSE MY SPECIFIC VIN DID NOT FALL UNDER THE RECALL, I WILL NOT BE GETTING REIMBURSED.

NOW IT IS VERY UNSAFE FOR ME TO DRIVE I CAN'T EVEN TAKE MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL MY NEIGHBOR HAS TO TAKE THEM AND PICK THEM UP! I WAS FINALLY SENT A RECALL LETTER THE LAST DAY OF JULY 2014. IN THIS RECALL ARE ALL THE PROBLEMS I AM HAVING. THEY SAY WHEN CALLED THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE PARTS TO FIX IT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE. WHAT AM I TO DO? I HAVE A CAR I AM PAYING FOR AND CAN NOT DRIVE!! I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BUY A DIFFERENT CAR. I TOLD THEM SINCE THEY HAD NO IDEA WHEN PARTS WOULD BE IN TO JUST REPLACE MY CAR AND THE ANSWER WAS NO!! THEY ALSO WANT ME TO PAY TO HAVE IT INSPECTED. THIS IS THEIR FAULT NOT MINE I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING!!!  *TR",

WE GOT TO OUR STREET AND HE STARTED TO TURN RIGHT INTO OUR DRIVE WAY AND HE ALL OF A SUDDEN THREW UP HIS ARMS. HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CAME AND TOLD ME THAT THE CAR STALLED AND THE BELL DINGED AND POWER STEERING CAME ON THE RADIO. WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 8/12/13. THEY DIAGNOSED THE CAR AND SAID THE POWER STEERING ASSIST MOTOR WAS SHORTING OUT AND IT WOULD COST ME 699.03 TO FIX. I HAD NO MONEY TO GET IT FIXED AND THE DEALER SAID THEY RE SET THE COMPUTER AND SAID I SHOULD HAVE IT FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE. MY SON TOOK THE CAR HOME AND IT HAPPENED TWICE ON THE WAY HOME. ON 9/25/13 WE HAD OUR LOCAL DEALER REPLACE THE MOTOR. THEY TOLD ME THE CODE THE COMPUTER READ SAID IT WAS EITHER THE ASSIST MOTOR OR THE STEERING COLUMN. THEY SAID THE MOTOR WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE AND REPLACED IT. THE TOTAL WAS 643.78 AND THE INITIAL INSPECTION WAS 99.53. ON 10/18/13 I HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN AS I WAS DRIVING INTO THE LOCAL MARKET PARKING LOT, DING,DING, DING AND I LOST POWER STEERING. I ALMOST HIT A PARKED CAR IN THE LOT AND COULDN'T STEER IT. I TOOK IT BACK AND THEY SAID IT IS THE INTERMEDIATE SHAFT OR THE STEERING COLUMN AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND CHARGED ME ANOTHER 90.00 TO LOOK AT IT. I CANNOT AFFORD 1200.00 TO FIX THE COLUMN. MY SON SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR 2006 MALIBU STEERING PROBLEMS AND FOUND TRANSPORT CANADA RECALLED 67,414 2005, 2006 AND 2008 MALIBU'S, PONTIAC AND SATURNS.

        "summary": "THIS HAS HAPPENED DOZENS OF TIMES BEFORE GM DID THE \"CAMPAIGN\" TO LESSEN THE AFFECT ON THE STEERING.  NORMALLY WHILE ACCELERATING HARD AROUND A CORNER OR UP A HILL, THE POWERSTEERING WOULD LITERALLY JERK THE WHEEL FROM YOUR HANDS AND ATTEMPT TO STRAIGHTEN THE WHEEL.  OBVIOUSLY THIS IS EXTREME DISCONCERTING AND DANGEROUS AT ANY SPEED.    SYMPTOMS ARE THE DING DING DING WARNING AND THE VERY BRIEF FLASH, LIKE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE IT, OF POWER STEERING ON THE RADIO DISPLAY.  THAT LASTS MAYBE 1.5 SECONDS BEFORE IT GOES AWAY, SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW TO LOOK AT THE RADIO VERY QUICKLY WHEN THE DING DING DING GOES TO SEE THE \"ERROR\" MESSAGE.    IT TOOK 2 TRIPS TO THE DEALER ON THE RECALL TO \"RESOLVE\" THE PROBLEM IN GM'S EYES.  WHAT THEY DO IS REPLACE THE COLUMN, AND SOME SETTINGS IN THE COMPUTER THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF FORCE THE MOTOR EXERTS AGAINST THE DRIVER.  THE WHEEL NO LONGER COMPLETELY JERKS FROM YOUR HANDS, BUT IT STILL WILL CHANGE YOUR COURSE WHEN ON A TURN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TIGHT GRIP ON THE WHEEL.    I CONSIDER THIS SUCH A SAFETY ISSUE, THAT I RARELY ALLOW ANYONE BUT MYSELF TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST SCARE THE BEJEAVIOUS OUT OF THEM FOR THE CAR TO TAKE THE WHEEL FROM THEIR HANDS.    WAS BACK IN THE DEALERSHIP YESTERDAY ON THE EXTENDED CAMPAIGN OF 150K MILES OR 10 YEARS.  THEY INDICATED THE FAULT WAS THAT THE MOTOR TOSSED AN OVERHEAT CODE AND THAT WAS CAUSING COMPUTER INPUT ISSUES OUT OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED.  I ADVISED IT DOES IT EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS COLD, NOT DRIVING FOR MORE THAN A MILE.  THEIR RESPONSE WAS THE MOTOR HAS AN INTERNAL FAULT THAT CAUSES IT TO OVERHEAT QUICKLY, JUST BY STARTING THE CAR.    REPAIRS COSTS ARE WELL OVER $700 PARTS AND LABOR, AND READING ON THE INTERNET, THIS PROBLEM MAY NOT EVEN BE RESOLVED BY SUCH A COSTLY REPAIR.  *TR",

THE REASON I DON'T KNOW BUT I WILL EVENTUALLY. WITH ALL I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE STEERING ALL THE PROBLEMS STARTED WITH DEFECT CODES.

OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS STEERING NOISE GETTING WORSE, SENSOR LIGHT CAME ON INDICATING POWER STEERING. CHECK WITH MECHANIC AND CANNOT FIND ANYTHING THAT APPEARS WRONG ON VEHICLE. JUST THIS WEEKEND ON THE ENTRANCE RAMP ON THE INTERSTATE THE WHEEL JUST JERKED TO THE RIGHT.  WAS ABLE TO BRING IT BACK TO CENTRAL POSITION QUICKLY BUT WAS CONCERNED.  HAPPENED TODAY TO MY WIFE ON THE WAY TO THE STORE ON A TWO LANE ROAD. LUCKILY IT JERKED HER TO THE RIGHT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO STEER IT BACK TO THE CENTER POSITION.  CONCERNED OF POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY NEXT TIME.

GM NEEDS TO WAKE UP, DOES IT TAKE PEOPLE DYING OR SERIOUSLY GETTING HURT BEFORE THEY WILL PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR ISSUES AND SERIOUS ONES AT THAT.  MY HUSBAND IS A FORD MECHANIC AND WANTED ME TO BUY A FORD BECAUSE OF QUALITY ISSUES, BUT I LOVE THE STYLE OF THE MAXX, THE CARGO CAPACITY AND NOW I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS AS NO ONE SEEMS TO BE GETTING HELP OTHER THAN GM HAS SOME SOLUTIONS THAT ARE COSTING THE CONSUMER LOTS OF MONEY AND THERE ARE STILL ISSUES AFTER THE FIXES.

AFTER A MINUTE OR SO THE STEERING CAME BACK BUT ONLY TO THE POINT WHERE I HAD TO PUT ALL MY MUSCLE INTO IT TO STEER. POWER STEERING FLASHED ON MY RADIO DURING THIS OCCASION. AFTER TURNING THE CAR ON AND OFF A COUPLE TIMES THE POWER STEERING FLASH DISAPPEARED AND MY STEERING WAS BACK TO NORMAL. I HAVE LOST STEERING COMPLETELY FOR A SHORT TIME DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE. THIS IS VERY UNSAFE. I TOOK MY CAR INTO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE ON JULY 9, 2010. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY STEERING COLUMN AND IT WOULD COST CLOSE TO 600 DOLLARS TO FIX. I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND FOR SOME REASON IT DOES NOT COVER THIS. THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL SITUATION. IT IS VERY UNSAFE FOR ME TO BE DRIVING AND I FEAR DRIVING MY SON IN THE CAR WITH ME. AFTER READING ONLINE I HAVE LEARNED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A 06 MALIBU WHO HAS STEERING COMPLAINTS. ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PAID HUNDREDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ONLY FOR IT TO RETURN. I CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX THIS PROBLEM THIS TIME LET ALONE IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN AFTER IT IS FIXED. I REALLY FEAR NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL MY VEHICLE. AS OF NOW MY VEHICLE CONTINUES TO FLASH POWER STEERING ON MY RADIO AND THE STEERING IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

I WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE RECALL THAT WAS ISSUED RECENTLY INCLUDES MY CAR, BUT IT DOES NOT...WHICH REALLY DISAPPOINTS ME SINCE I JUST PRINTED OFF AROUND 15 PAGES OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS TO TAKE TO MY DEALER.    THE FAILURE ON MY CAR STARTED LAST SPRING-SUMMER AND HAVE HAD IT LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES.  I WAS DRIVING WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO FEEL LIKE IT WAS FREEZING AND THEN WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO DRIVE STRAIGHT, IT WOULD EITHER GO FAR RIGHT OR FAR LEFT.  I THOUGHT I NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT (WHICH I HAD DONE), BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP AT ALL.  THIS TERRIFIED ME.  IT HAPPENS AT LEAST 2-3 TIMES A DAY ALL WEEK LONG.   WE HAVE REPLACED THE STEERING COLUMN (ON OUR OWN-RECALL ON 2005 MALIBU'S WON'T COVER MY 2006 EVEN THOUGH THE REP AT GM WE TALKED TO CONFIRMED MY CAR CAME OFF THE LINE IN 2005) AND IT STARTED DOING THE SAME THING THE NEXT DAY.    HERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF EVERYTHING MY CAR DOES.  IT HAS ALWAYS MADE A CLUNKING NOISE WHEN I TURN THE WHEEL IN EITHER DIRECTION.  THE STEERING WHEEL WILL FREEZE UP AND BECOMES REALLY TIGHT MAKING IT HARD TO CONTROL.  WHEN IT'S FROZEN, AND I TRY TO DRIVE STRAIGHT BY SLIGHTLY TURNING THE WHEEL, IT WILL ONLY TURN DRASTICALLY TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT MAKING MY WHOLE CAR JERK TO EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.  ALSO WHEN IT'S DOING THIS, IT MAKE A LOUD VIBRATION NOISE AND THE WHEEL MOVES ON IT OWN IF I'M STOPPED AT A LIGHT OR IN PARK..EVEN OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE CAR IS TURNED OFF.  WHEN IT'S MAKING THIS LOUD SOUND I CAN ALSO FEEL THE VIBRATION IN THE BRAKE PAD.  POWER STEERING WILL DISPLAY ON THE DIC SCREEN ON THE DASH.  FROM WHAT I'VE READ,I KNOW HUNDRED OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO KEEP THROWING MONEY INTO PROBLEMS THAT WERE CREATED EVEN BEFORE WE BOUGHT THESE CARS.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE DIES. *TR",

AT THAT TIME, IT WOULD ONLY HAPPEN EVERY SO OFTEN SO I COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE THEM KEEP MY CAR FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.

I TRIED TO STEER WITH THE CAR OPERATING IN MANUAL STEERING WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO DO SINCE I'M 72 YEARS OLD.  I LET THE CAR DRIFT TO A PARKING LOT AND PROCEEDED TO CUT THE MOTOR OFF AND START AGAIN TO TRY TO   GET POWER STEERING IN AN OPERATIVE MODE.  THIS HAPPENED TO ME A NUMBER OF TIMES .  COMING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY THERE IS A FIRE HYDRANT AND THE WHEEL  LOCKED AND I COULD NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE  HYDRANT IN TIME AND I HIT IT.  I  WAS TURNING A CORNER IN TO TRAFFIC AND IT LOCKED AGAIN.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID TO TAKE IT TO SOMEONE THAT REQUIRED THAT I LEAVE IT OVERNIGHT . BUT THE SHOP WAS QUITE A DISTANCE FROM MY HOME.  I WAITED UNTIL JULY AND CALLED THE SALESMAN WHO WORKS AT A DIFFERENT PLACE NOW AND HE SAID I COULD TAKE TO ANY CHEVROLET DEALER TO HAVE IT REPAIRED.  I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH ZURICH .  THE REPAIR SHOP STATES THAT THEY DON'T COVER ALL THE COST TO GET IT REPAIRED LESS $200.00 OUT OF POCKET.

DID NOT COMFORT ME AT ALL.  I EXPRESSED THAT I WANTED TO TERMINATE MY LEASE ON THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL SAFE IN IT ANYMORE.  SO HE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH CERTAINS STEPS AND NOT TO OVERREACT.  CHEVROLET CALLED OUT THEIR 3RD PARTY GROUP OF ENGINEERING SPECIALIST TO INSPECT THE CAR AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT A COMPONENT IN THE POWERSTEERING MONITOR DID IN FACT FAIL. CHEVROLET'S REP. STATED THAT THE ONLY OPTION I HAD WAS TO REPAIR THE CAR.  IF  I REFUSED,THEY WOULD TAKE THE RENTAL CAR BACK ASAP.  SO IN SO MANY WORDS THEY TOLD ME THAT IT IS EITHER THEIR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.

THEY EVEN EXTENDED IT UNTIL AFTER THE CAR IS REPAIRED AND STATED THAT THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.  AS OF TODAY, ON DEC. 8,2007 THE CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP.
