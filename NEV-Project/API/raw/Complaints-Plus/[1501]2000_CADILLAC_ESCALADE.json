THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT EXPLAINED THAT THE CAUSE WAS A SHORT IN THE HEATER BUT A SHORT IS SUPPOSED TO AUTOMATICALLY TURN OF THE HEATER.  THEY ESTIMATED THE HEATER GOT UP TO 140-150 DEGREES IN ORDER FOR IT TO BURN THE LEATHER SEAT.  I CONTACTED CADILLAC TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE SEAT AND THEY STATED THEY HAD NO RECALLS ON 2000 CADILLAC ESCALADES FOR THE HEATED SEATS.  I SIMPLY REQUESTED FOR THEM TO COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THE SEAT BUT THEY STATED THAT MY WARRANTY AND CONTRACT DID NOT COVER THAT TYPE OF MALFUNCTION.
