        "summary": "The fuse block/box has been identified, as the problem by the manufacturer and reported to the dealer service centers. There have been numerous complaints filed on the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse fuse block. Service techs were instructed (years ago) to look at the fuse block when the following problems were reported by the owner. If they knew to instruct their techs to look at the fuse block/box, then they knew it was defective - it should have been recalled/replaced at that time. Since it wasn't, there have been ongoing safety risk to many vehicle owners and passengers. It has also required owners to pay hundreds of dollars to repair/replace the known defective part; I just paid $965.00. While driving at any speed, the car will begin shaking/jerking; dashboard messages begin:  Engine Power is Reduced, Traction Control Off, Service Stabilitrak, along with the Service Engine light.  In the city, before you can move over out of traffic, the engine stalls/stops. You are in the middle of the street with no engine power, no steering, and no brakes. This is very dangerous and can immediately result in an accident...to you/the driver, or cause an accident further behind, when the other drivers can't see that traffic has stopped.  Even with flashers on, it may take several attempts to get the vehicle started again. The same situation occurred last year traveling down a highway at a speed of 70 mph, while we (myself and spouse) were able to pull off the road, had the car not started again - we would have had a towing bill back to the dealership service center.  We were not told about the fuse block/box (known) problem at that time.              I am truly shocked, very disappointed and angry to learn (on my own) that the safety of my granddaughter (from birth) has been a risk every time we traveled in my vehicle. She and I travel alone, sometimes up to 3/4 hrs. away to see family, and could have been in an accident or stranded on the side of a highway, or street, many times.",

I was driving on the highway with my 3 children and all of a sudden the lights on my dashboard start lighting up the warning bell starts ringing and the dash displays the messages, \u201c engine power is reduced, service traction control, service stabilitrack, traction control off.\u201d When this happened my car suddenly slowed down on its own and then ultimately just turned off. I was on the highway so traveling about 70mph. There was a LOT of traffic, we were very lucky that I had a few seconds to pull onto the shoulder when the messages started appearing on the dash before the car turned off I was not at a complete stop when the car shut off and couldn\u2019t steer at all.  We could have been hit by a car traveling at a high rate of speed. This same issue has occurred several times since the first incident, I am scared to even put my children into this vehicle.

This turns off the traction control and reduces power to 3 cylinders, thus causing the vehicle to go into limp mode and can cause an accident.  This problem is intermittent and the dealers can't seem to find the underlying issue. It will happen whole parked, stopped at an intersection or driving at highway speeds. I have had this happen while driving in heavy traffic on the freeway and in the number one lane. My vehicle lost power and I had to try and negotiate three traffic lanes to stop along side the freeway. I had to put the transmission in park and shut the engine off for 15 seconds in order to clear the code and safely proceed back into traffic. The check engine light remains on for a period of time, but will clear itself.  This is unsafe and needs to be address by GM as it is happening to multiple model types in GM vehicle lineup.",

HE TRIED PRESSING THE TRACTION CONTROL BUTTON BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON AND THE BRAKES WERE FORCED AGAIN AND NOTHING. IMAGINE GOING 25MPH AND STOPPING ABRUPTLY WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS FOR OTHER CARS TO SEE.     THIS TIME I DID RESEARCH AND I SAW THAT OTHER 2014 CHEVY TRAVERSES WERE RECALLED FOR THE CHASSIS MODULE (RECALL NUMBER 14V614000). I SAW YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND I CHECKED SEVERAL CONSUMER THE COMPLAINT WEBSITES AND I LITERALLY SAW OVER 10 OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE THIS MONTH! I ALSO PUT A READER IN MY VEHICLE AND THE TWO CODES THAT COME UP IS P16AA & P1682. ONE IS FOR THE ELECTRONIC MODULE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE CHASSIS (PERTAINING TO THE RECALL) IS LISTED UNDER).      I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THE RECALL WAS ACTIVE FOR 2014 CHEVY TRAVERSES..... BUT NOT MINE! I AM COMPLETELY DISGUSTED.     THESE VEHICLES WILL KILL YOU - LITERALLY AND THEY KNOW IT, AND THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!     NOW I'M PAYING A CAR NOTE AND I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE IT - FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, OTHERS, AND MYSELF.     SHAME ON THEM - AGAIN THIS IS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE!

I PARKED AND TURNED IT OFF THEN TURNED IT BACK ON AFTER A MINUTE.  IT WAS BACK TO NORMAL EXCEPT THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD THEM CHECK IT OUT.  THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING TO FIX AND SAID TO CALL AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENED AGAIN (THEY DID CHARGE THE BATTERY).  I WENT AND PICKED IT UP AND DROVE IT 10 MILES.  I PARKED AND SHUT IT OFF.    WHEN I CAME BACK OUT TO START IT ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER, THIS TIME THERE WAS AN ERROR ABOUT THE GUIDELINES ON THE CAMERA SYSTEM NOT WORKING AND THE SAME STABILITRAK ERROR.  SO I SHUT IT OFF AND STARTED IT BACK UP. IT SEEMED TO BE FUNCTIONAL AFTER RESTARTING IT.  IT WAS OKAY FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL THE MAJOR ERRORS HAPPENED AGAIN THIS MORNING.  I WAS TRYING TO PULL INTO A PARKING SPOT AND IT DID THE SAME THING WITH THE SAME ERRORS THAT I FIRST HAD.  IT ACTUALLY WENT TO A TOTAL STOP AND WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD AT ALL.  I WAS THANKFUL THAT I WAS IN A PARKING LOT AND NOT ON THE HIGHWAY MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH ME.  IT WAS SO SUDDEN, THAT IF WE HAD BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY, I AM SURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  I TURNED IT OFF AND BACK ON AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN WITH THE SAME ERRORS.  SO I TURNED IT OFF AGAIN AND LET IT SIT FOR A MINUTE AND TURNED IT BACK ON.  THE ERRORS WERE GONE BUT THE SERVICE LIGHT WAS ON.  IT SEEMED FUNCTIONAL AGAIN. THERE ARE TONS OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS REPORTED ONLINE.  THE DEALERSHIP IS SUPPOSED TO CHECK IT AGAIN.",

THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS NEVER BEEN CHANGED AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CRACKS ON MY FRONT WINDOW. I HAVE NO CLUE HOW THE WATER IS COMING INTO MY TRAVERSE FROM THE TOP AND LEAKING IN THROUGH THE FRONT OVER HEAD LAMPS. I HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP, 1 DAY AGO I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE. I ASKED IF IT WAS COMMON, WITH THE TRAVERSE AND I WAS TOLD NO. I OBVIOUSLY THEY LIED, BECAUSE I HAD TO COME ON THIS WEBSITE TO SEE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS. I AM NOT A CAR EXPERT BUT THE MAN AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT HAS BEEN DOING THIS LINE OF WORK FOR 30+ YEARS SAID HE COULD SMELL THE WATER HAS SOON HAS HE SAT IN THE VEHICLE. SO OBVIOUSLY WATER HAS BEEN LEAKING IN FROM SOME WHERE FOR A WHILE NOW TO BE ABLE TO SMELL THE WATER. I KEEP MY CAR VERY CLEAN AND MY CARPETS ARE DRY. SO THE WATER MUST BE COMING IN SOMEWHERE FROM THE ROOF AND STAYING RESERVED IN A PARTICULAR AREA UNTIL IT POURS OUT. THE WATER MAY BE THE REASON I AM HAVING THE OTHER ISSUES, AND MAY BE EACH PROBLEMS IS NOT RELATED AT ALL. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I AM PAYING CAR NOTE ON A CAR THAT IS AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT DRIVING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT SAFE TO DRIVE. I HAVE NOT ONLY MY SAFETY TO WORRY ABOUT I ALSO HAVE MY CHILDREN SAFETY CONSIDER AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT RIDE IN THIS VEHICLE TOO. THE LIGHTS DIMS WHILE DRIVING OR WHEN IDLING. THE SERVICE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON ALL THE TIME WHEN DRIVING, IDLING, OR IN PARK.  *TR",
