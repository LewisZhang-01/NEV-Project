MY CAR DID EXACTLY WHAT GM SAID IT WOULD DO TO CONFIRM IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY BUT THE GM SERVICE DEPARTMENT DENIED THE ISSUE CLAIMING IT WAS A LOOSE VACUM HOSE AND WOULD NOT REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY. MY VEHICLE STILL DOES NOT OPERATE AS IT SHOULD WHICH I KNOW IS DUE TO THE THROTTLE BODY ISSUE. THOUSANDS OF OWNERS HAVE CONFIRMED THE SAME ISSUE AND OBVIOUSLY GM KNOWS ABOUT THE  ISSUES BUT CHOOSES TO GO AROUND IT BY CALLING IT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH MAKES THE REPLACEMENT CONDITIONAL. I AM 100% SURE THAT I AND MILLLIONS OF TAHOE OWNERS KNOW THIS SHE BE A RECALL AND NOT A SO CALLED EXTENDED WARRANTY TO GET AROUND THE EXPENSE OF MAKING A RECALL. WHEN THE ISSUE OCCURED I WENT FLYING DOWN THE FREEWAY WITH MINIMAL ABILITY TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN, I HAD TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE TO THE SHOP BY RIDING MY BREAKS BECAUSE THE VEHICLES THROTTLE BODY WOULD NOT LET THE TRUCKS RPM GO BELOW X3000.

AT ALMOST EXACTLY 3 YEARS AND 30,000 MILES OF OWNERSHIP, THE DOOR LOCKS OF MY, PURCHASED NEW, 2008 TAHOE LTZ BEGAN TO FAIL.  ALL FOUR LOCKS FAILED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF EACH OTHER.  THE VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 40,000 MILES AND FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE AT THE LAST AND FINAL (4TH) FAILURE.  CONCERN: (#1) THERE IS ONLY ONE MANUAL KEYED ENTRY LOCATED ON THE VEHICLE WHICH IS THE DRIVERS DOOR.  IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY AND TOTAL ELECTRONIC LOCK FAILURE, THE ONLY PASSENGER DOOR ACCESS WOULD BE THROUGH THE DRIVERS DOOR UTILIZING THE KEY AND MANUAL LOCK/UNLOCK FEATURE.  IF THE MANUAL LOCK WERE TO ALSO FAIL, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE THROUGH ANY OF THE FOUR PASSENGER DOORS.  RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE COULD COST THE LIFE OF A CHILD, ADULT PASSENGER OR PET TRAPPED IN THE VEHICLE.  THE SYSTEM COULD BE DESIGNED SAFER WITH A REDUNDANT MANUAL LOCK LOCATED ON ANOTHER DOOR.  ADDITIONALLY, THE ELECTRONIC LOCKING MECHANISMS CURRENTLY INSTALLED ARE INADEQUATE AND UNSAFE.  THE COMMON FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS ELIMINATES THE ARGUMENT OF ELECTRONIC REDUNDANCY FOR THE SYSTEM SINCE THE INSTALLED PRODUCT IS FAULTY AND UNRELIABLE.  WHY SHOULD WE BE FORCED TO ACCEPT THESE UNSAFE PRODUCTS/DESIGNS ON OUR VEHICLES?  CONCERN: (#2)  THE COST OF REPLACING A LOCK HAS BEEN QUOTED BETWEEN $250 TO $450 PER LOCK FROM DIFFERENT FACILITIES.  THE PRICING MAY INFLUENCE A GENERALLY SAFE MINED PERSON TO POSTPONE A REPAIR WHICH IMPACTS THE  REDUNDANCY FEATURE OF THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM.  NOTE: THESE LOCKS TYPICALLY BEGIN TO FAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.  AND, GM CORPORATION IS UNWILLING TO HELP WITH THE COST AND WASTED TIME TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA IS WARRANTED AND I FEEL A RECALL SHOULD BE MANDATED.  *TR",
