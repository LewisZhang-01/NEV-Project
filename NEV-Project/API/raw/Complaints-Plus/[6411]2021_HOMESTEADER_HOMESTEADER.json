        "summary": "The manufacture of the trailer installed the brake wiring component incorrectly. The wiring was installed with tension against the body frame of the trailer. No protective insulation or other protection was provided between the wires and the trailer frame. The wiring failed due to it rubbing against the trailer frame and being excessively taught. Of the four wires for the brakes, two completely severed from the other side, one the wire had severed but was being held in place by the insulation, one wire was still intact. See photos for detail. This resulted in the trailer brakes being in operable. Thankfully no accident occurred but this could have resulted in a major catastrophe or even fatalities. All trailers from this manufacture should be recalled for inspection for correct installation of brake wires so that they do not fail at an in opportune time.",
