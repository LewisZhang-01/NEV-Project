WE HAVE HAD THE WHEELS ON VEHICLE THAT DID NOT COME OFF INSPECTED AND CHECKED TO PROPER TORQUE FOLLOWING ALL INCIDENTS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TORQUED APPROPRIATELY.      THE INCIDENT DATES WERE, 12/29/07 ,02/15/08,  AND 07/17/08 .    ON 12/29/07 AN EMPLOYEE WAS DRIVING UP A ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 20 M.P.H. WHEN THE DRIVER SIDE BACK DUAL WHEELS CAME OFF DUE TO BROKEN LUG BOLTS. THIS WAS A NORMAL USE OF THE VEHICLE ON A WELL-MAINTAINED DIRT ROAD.
