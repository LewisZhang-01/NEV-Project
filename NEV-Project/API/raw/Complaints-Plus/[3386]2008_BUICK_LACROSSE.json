PLUS, KEY WOULD NOT TURN IN IGNITION & CAR WHEEL LOCKED UP. IT WAS WINTER SEASON !! CAR WAS STATIONERY. ALL CAR WINDOWS WERE ROLLED UP SO MY MOM COULD NOT GET ANY HEAT NOR FRESH AIR. MY MOM COULD HAVE FROZE TO DEATH INSIDE OF HER CAR !! MORE SCARY -- WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN NOR HOW LONG THE NEXT LOCKOUT WILL LAST !! CLEARLY THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE !! ESPECIALLY FOR A SENIOR CITIZEN PERSON. WE ARE AMAZED THAT BUICK DID NOT YET ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT. I FOUND BUICK FORUMS ON THE INTERNET WHERE HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINED OF SAME RELATED PROBLEMS !! I EMAILED ALL 7 WEBSITES TO BCR. SOME PEOPLE CANNOT EVEN UNLOCK DRIVER CAR DOOR TO INTO GET INTO DRIVER'S SEAT !! THEY HAVE TO ENTER THEIR CARS THRU PASSENGER & CRAWL OVER TO PASSENGER CAR SEAT OR ENTER FROM BACKSEAT OF THE CAR !! OBVIOUSLY BUICK & GM NEVER DID ANYTHING YET ABOUT THIS SCARY & ANNOYING PROBLEM !! ON MARCH 16 2018 I OPENED A NEW CASE #8-4000469674 WITH BUICK CUSTOMER RELATIONS (BCR). THEY FLAGGED THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE !! BCR SAID BUICK WILL ONLY WORK WITH A BUICK CAR DEALER ON THIS ISSUE IF MY MOM BRINGS HER CAR TO A BUICK CAR DEALER. SO WE MADE AN APPT FOR THIS MONDAY, APRIL 16 8:30AM AT FOX VALLEY BUICK (FVB) IN ST. CHARLES, IL TO GET HER BUICK CAR DIAGNOSED !! BCR WILL WORK WITH FVB & CEM (CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGER). CLEARLY -- THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE !!  IN HOT HEAT OR WINTER COLD -- A PERSON CAN LITERALLY SUFFOCATE OR FREEZE BEING A TRAPPED PRISONER INSIDE OF THEIR CAR !!! 2 BCR REPS FAILED TO CALL ME BACK OVER 4 DAYS. ONE BCR REP WAS SUPERVISOR.

THEY ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING VEHICLES THAT ARE PLACE INTO OPERATION ON OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS. THEIR WORK DIRECTLY AFFECTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE THAN THEIR LICENSED COLLEAGUES IN CONSULTING ENGINEERING.

VEHICLE MANUFACTURES HAVE THE INHERENT RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE FOR VEHICLE SAFETY AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE NOTIFICATION OF DEFECTS AND NONCOMPLIANCE ISSUES.

WHILE OPERATING MY VEHICLE SOUTHBOUND, AT A SPEED OF 60-65 MPH, AROUND THE 147 MILE-MARKER, THE REAR SPOILER DETACHES FROM MY VEHICLE CAUSING AT LEAST TWO TRAILING VEHICLES TO OPERATE THEIR VEHICLES ERRATICALLY IN AN AVOIDANCE MANEUVER.

WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL IN OCTOBER RECOVERING FROM CANCER SURGERY MY WIFE EXPERIENCED A HEADLIGHT FAILURE WHEN DRIVING HOME ALONE AT NIGHT.  A NEIGHBOR TOOK THE CAR TO THE BUICK DEALER AND THEY INSTALLED A RELAY, PART #15016745.  WE THEN NOTICED THAT THE LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT AND THE RIGHT REAR TAILIGHT WERE NOT LIT.  AS SOON AS I WAS CLEARED TO DRIVE I TOOK IT BACK AND THEY INSISTED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THEIR FAULT, THAT IT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT IT HAPPENED AT THAT TIME.  I PAID THE $68.93 FOR NEW BULBS.  TODAY I LOOKED AT THE WEBSITE, WWW.MYGM.COM/RECALLS  AND IT SAID THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS PENDING FOR OUR VEHICLE.  WHEN I CALLED THE TELEPHONE NUMBER GIVEN ON THAT WEBPAGE, THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT WAS A MISTAKE, BUT HE COULD NOT FIND ANY INFORMATION ON WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE PARTS AVAILABLE OR WHY THE WEBSITE DENIED THERE WAS A RECALL.

IF I HELD THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR, AFTER ABOUT 5 SECONDS THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY. I COULD THEN MAINTAIN SPEED BY ALTERNATELY STEPPING ON AND RELEASING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL QUICKLY. ACCELERATING FROM A STOPLIGHT IS A VERY SLOW AND DISRUPTIVE  (TO TRAFFIC) PROCESS. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAS FAILED SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT REPAIR. ON SOME OCCASIONS, THE CAR HAS BEGUN TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN DURING THIS PERIOD OF MALFUNCTION, SUCH THAT I HAVE HAD TO RIDE THE BRAKE PEDAL. ON SOME OCCASIONS THIS PROBLEM HAS REMEDIED ITSELF AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS, WITH TURNING THE ENGINE ON AND OFF TO REBOOT. THE PROBLEM CAN LAST FOR DAYS AT A TIME. I HAVE REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY SENSOR TO NO AVAIL. INTERESTINGLY, I ALSO OWNED (UNTIL LAST WEEK)  A 2007 LACROSSE WHICH DOES THE EXACT SAME THING, AND HAS ALSO HAD THE THROTTLE BODY SENSOR REPLACED WITH NO LUCK.   I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS BY PEOPLE ONLINE, DESCRIBING EXACTLY THE SAME CONDITIONS AND WARNINGS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE WHEN IT HAPPENS, AS I CANNOT SAFELY ACCELERATE IN BUSY TRAFFIC, AND THE CAR SLOWS DOWN TO SPEEDS  UNSAFE FOR THE CONDITIONS.

DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL IT HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES, SO I HEADED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR HELP.  THEY INSTRUCTED ME NOT TO PUT ANYTHING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD SENSE THE WEIGHT AND THINK THERE IS A PERSON THERE.  SO I DIDN'T, BUT I DID NOTICE THE INDICATOR ABOVE THE RADIO THAT SENSES A PERSON IN THE PASSENGER SEAT DIDN'T TURN RED DURING THIS TIME.  THEN THE GAME BEGAN.  I WOULD PUT MY LUNCH BOX IN THE SEAT ON THE WAY TO WORK, SOMETIMES THE AIR BAG LIGHT WOULD COME ON, SOMETIMES IT WOULDN'T.  AND, I FOUND THERE IS A DELAY IN THE SWITCH, WHEN ADDING OR REMOVING THE LUNCH BOX.  SOMETIMES AFTER REMOVING THE LUNCH BOX THE AIR BAG LIGHT WOULD STAY ON, OR JUST COME ON WHEN IT WANTED TO.  FOUND OUT HOW TO FIX THAT PROBLEM ALSO, ALBEIT TEMPORARILY.  TAKE YOUR FINGERS AND FIRMLY PUSH 4-5 TIMES ALONG THE STITCHING IN THE CENTER OF THE SEAT.  WILL TAKE A FEW SECONDS AND THE LIGHT MAY, OR MAY NOT, GO OUT.  OR, A QUICK STOP TO GRAB A DRINK WILL RESET THE LIGHT.  THE PROBLEM IS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU GET IN A CRASH WHILE THE LIGHT IS ON THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE YOUR AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, I OWNED A 1994 FORD AEROSTAR VAN WHICH I TOOK TO THE DEALER WHEN THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON.  THEY WOULD NOT LET ME DRIVE THE VAN, FOR FEAR THE AIR BAGS WOULD NOT WORK IN A CRASH, AND GAVE ME A LOANER WHILE THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM.  I DID NOTICE BUICK HAS SERVICE BULLETINS ON THE AIR BAG PROBLEM, STATING  \"PROBLEM COULD BE CAUSED BY LOOSE, MISSING, OR BROKEN CONNECTOR POSITION ASSURANCE (CPA) RETAINER. \" (SB-08-09-41-002C)  CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE THE HOLD-UP IN FIXING THE PROBLEM, JUST HOPING I AM NOT THE FIRST STATISTIC.   *TR",

I CAN'T DESCRIBE THE HORROR, LOOKING OUT MY REAR VIEW MIRROR, WITNESSING OUR DEMISE TIME AFTER TIME.  THOSE 15 MINUTES SEEMED LIKE AN ETERNITY. WHEN THE HIGHWAY PATROL ARRIVED THEY CLOSED LANES AND ASSISTED IN PUSHING CAR OUT OF THE HIGHLY TRAFFIC LANES.  IT TOOK MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH TO TURN THE STEERING WHILE IN NEUTRAL. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO CONKLIN FANGMAN KC DEALERSHIP AND I HAD TO REPLACE IGNITION COIL AND MODULE THAT COST ME $933.16.  THEY SAID THESE PARTS WERE NOT ON THE RECALL LIST, WHICH I HAVE FOUND OUT SINCE THEN GM HAS PUT DEALERSHIPS ON NOTICE OF THIS PROBLEM. IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH SUPPLYING ENOUGH MANUFACTURED PARTS TO TAKE CARE OF RECALL.  IF I COULD AFFORD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR I WOULD BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL SAFE ANY LONGER IN THIS CAR. EMOTIONALLY I AM STILL SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA.  *TR",

BUICK DOESN'T  LIST ANY TECHNICAL BULLETINS PERTAINING TO THIS MALFUNCTION.    THIS IS A VERY DIS-CONCERNING ISSUE ANY TIME WE DRIVE AND I SUPPOSE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE ALSO. *TR",
