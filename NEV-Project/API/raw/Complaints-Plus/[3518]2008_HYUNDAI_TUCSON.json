He is 91 years old and shattered his upper arm.  We had the vehicle fixed and checked out and was told all was fine.  About June of 2021 I took the car in for a recall on the brake lights to the Hyundai dealership and told them of the first incident and asked them to check and was told that all was fine.  On December 23rd 2021, the same thing happened when I was pulling into my parking space at home.  When it accelerated, I had both feet on the brake and ended up hitting a wall damaging the car again.  Fortunately, this time injuries were minor.  There were no warning lights, messages or symptoms before these two incidents happened.  I am concerned that others will be put at risk if this happens again or to anyone else with one of these vehicles.  I might add that with these accidents, the airbags did not deploy.  The first was a significant crash which should have deployed the airbags.",

INSTANTLY LOOK IN REARVIEW MIRROR THINKING SUNSHADE FLEW ONTO THE ROAD, BUT SAW NOTHING. THANK GOODNESS B/C THIS SITUATION COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS. GO TO DEALERSHIP & WAS TOLD IT'S A RECALL PRODUCT & TOLD ME WHICH REPAIR SHOP TO GO TO. HEARD BACK FROM REPAIR SHOP NEXT DAY (3/29); THEY SAID I'D HAVE TO PAY $180 (PUTTING FABRIC ON SUNSHADE & SERVICE MAINTENANCE). I WAS SHOCKED B/C I WASN'T EXPECTING TO PAY FOR A RECALL PRODUCT. CALL WEBASTO TO SEE IF THEY'LL REIMBURSE ME & THEY SAID THEY ONLY COVER PARTS. THIS SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE; IT'S THEIR BAD PRODUCT & THEY NEED TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO FIX IT. WAS ALSO INFORMED THE PARTS NEEDED TO BE ORDERED. FIND OUT TODAY THAT WEBASTO DIDN'T HAVE A PART & IT WOULDN'T GET TO THE REPAIR COMPANY UNTIL THURS (4/9) OR FRI (4/10) OF THIS WEEK. HAD TO GET A RENTAL CAR B/C I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF PERSONAL STUFF & I COULDN'T KEEP INCONVENIENCING FRIENDS. CALLED WEBASTO HOPING THEY COULD AT LEAST REIMBURSE ME FOR A RENTAL CAR (WAIT TIME WAS ON THEM). THEY ALREADY WOULDN'T COVER THE COST FOR THE $180. WELL, THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULDN'T REIMBURSE ME FOR THE RENTAL. CHECKED W/ MY INSURANCE CO. & THEY WOULDN'T EITHER. IT'S GOING ON 10 DAYS NOW W/O MY CAR & I PROBABLY WON'T GET IT BACK UNTIL FRI (4/10) OR MON (4/12), WHICH WOULD PUT ME AT 13-16 DAYS. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND MY FRUSTRATION. I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING BLAMED SINCE I'M HAVING TO SPEND $380 ALL B/C THE PRODUCT WAS DEFECTED TO BEGIN WITH; NONE OF THIS WAS MY FAULT. I'D BE APPRECIATIVE IF THE COST OF MY RENTAL CAR & REPAIR SHOP FEE BE REIMBURSED TO ME. I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR, AS THIS IS A HUGE INCONVENIENCE.   *TR",

I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGH TRAFFIC ROAD THRU TOWN. I WAS TERRIFIED SINCE I COULD NOT JUST STOP THE CAR AND HAD TO DRIVE APPROX 100' WITH POOR VISIBILITY. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THE INCIDENT & TO GET SERVICE. THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME IT WAS A SAFETY HAZARD DRIVING WITH NO WIPERS AND TO GET IT IN. I EXPLAINED THAT I LIVED 50 MINUTES AWAY AND HAD TO WAIT FOR THE WEATHER TO CLEAR BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE DRIVE. ON 3/25/10 I DROVE MY TUCSON TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CHARGED 47.50 FOR THE REPAIR IF IT ENDED UP BEING A NUT, DUE TO THE WARRANTY NOT COVERING IT. I STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NEW, IT WAS A SAFETY HAZARD & THAT I REFUSED TO PAY SUCH A CHARGE. I TOLD THE TECH THAT IF I WAS CHARGED I WOULD FOLLOW THRU WITH THE PROPER CHANNELS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SUCH CHARGE. AFTER SERVICING MY TUCSON I WAS TOLD THAT THEY FOUND THE WIPERS LOOSE AT THE MOTOR AND THEY FOUND THE NUT OFF LINKAGE. THEY REPLACED NUT, TESTED THE TUCSON AND SAID  THE VEHICLE WAS DONE. THE GENTLEMEN TOLD ME THIS NUT BECOME LOOSE DUE TO SNOW/ICE BEING ON MY WINDSHIELD & TRYING TO USE THE WIPERS. HE STATED THAT THEY MANUFACTURE IT THIS WAY SO YOU DONT BLOW THE WIPER MOTOR. SO MUST BE YOU CANT DRIVE WHEN ITS SNOWING OR SLEETING OUT EITHER SINCE THIS COULD CAUSE THE NUT TO BECOME LOOSE ON THE WIPER TRANSMISSION?... THIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME!  IT WAS RAINING OUT.

YESTERDAY (3/21/10) WHEN ON A SHORT ROAD TRIP I STOPPED FOR GAS. ON STARTING, THE ENGINE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN (WITHOUT ACCELERATOR PRESSURE) TO AN IDLE RPM OF 5000 WHILE IN \"PARK\". IT DID THIS REPEATEDLY. I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN GEAR ONLY BY SHIFTING IT RAPIDLY INTO DRIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTING, BEFORE THE ENGINE RPM INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.  THE CAR WOULD THEN MAINTAIN A ROAD SPEED OF AROUND 60 MPH ON ITS OWN WITHOUT ACCELERATOR PRESSURE IF THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED. THANKFULLY, THE BRAKES WOULD SLOW THE CAR, BUT AT A STOP (WHILE IN DRIVE) THE ENGINE WOULD IDLE AT 2000 RPM REQUIRING MARKED BRAKE PRESSURE TO KEEP IT FROM ACCELERATING FORWARD. IF PLACED IN NEUTRAL THE ENGINE WOULD ACCELERATE TO AROUND 5000 RPM. IT DID THIS CONTINUOUSLY AND REPEATEDLY OVER A 6 HOUR PERIOD OF TIME.    THIS AM (THE FOLLOWING MORNING) THE CAR FUNCTIONED NORMALLY!     I AM IN SYRACUSE FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS AND WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE CAR SERVICED IN THE DC AREA, IF IT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION SATISFACTORY IN THE INTERIM. OBVIOUSLY, THIS SITUATION IS DANGEROUS AND RINGS OF THE TOYOTA FIASCO. I CALLED HYUNDAI MOTOR CONSUMER ASSISTANCE (800-633-5151) TO REGISTER THE CONCERN, BUT WAS PLACED ON HOLD INTERMINABLY AND NEVER GOT THROUGH.
