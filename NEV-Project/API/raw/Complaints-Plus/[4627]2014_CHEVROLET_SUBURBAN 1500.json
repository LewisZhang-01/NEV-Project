AT FIRST, THE LOUD NOISE CAUSED ME TO THINK IT CRACKED. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PERONEAL TENDON HAD SLIPPED OUT OF IT'S ANKLE GROOVE & THE SUPPORTING LIGAMENT WAS NOW STRETCHED & UNABLE TO PROPERLY SUPPORT THE TENDONS & ANKLE.  I'VE BEEN GETTING TREATMENT SINCE THEN & IT STILL IS NOT COMPLETELY HEALED. IT HAS LIMITED MY ABILITY TO  WORK, EXERCISE, ETC. ALL BECAUSE OF THE STUPID PLACEMENT OF AN EB PEDAL.  I NO LONGER USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  PS: YOUR SITE WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO ENTER THAT I WAS INJURED & REQUIRED MEDICAL TREATMENT<<<<<<<<",

RPMS EXCEED 3500 UNLESS USING MANUAL TRANSMISSION FUNCTION.  AFTER RE-STARTING THE VEHICLE, SOME OR ALL WARNING LIGHTS EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR, AND THE VEHICLE APPEARS TO RETURN TO NORMAL.
