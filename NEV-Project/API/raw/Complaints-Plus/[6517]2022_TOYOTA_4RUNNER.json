        "summary": "I purchased a 2022 Toyota 4RUNNER and 9 days later the wiring harness was destroyed by rodents most like squirrels. Toyota switched to soy based wire insulation without taking precautions in the design to protect the wiring from rodents attracted to the insulation material. The resulting damage cost $8000 to repair and it will take months for the harness to be in stock. This failure caused all safety features to be disabled leaving the vehicle without standard safety functions.",
