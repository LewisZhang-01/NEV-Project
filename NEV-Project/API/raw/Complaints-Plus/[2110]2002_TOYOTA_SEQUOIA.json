I HAD RUST ISSUES SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2002.  IN 2006, THE LIFT GATE WINDOW RUSTED OUT AND COULD NO LONGER USE THE LIFT GATE WINDOW.  SINCE THEN, MORE RUST WAS DEVELOPING IN THE LIFT GATE AND ELSEWHERE.  IN 2013, I RECEIVED THE RECALL FOR THE SPARE TIRE CABLE.  THE LOUISIANA DEALERSHIP IDENTIFIED THAT THE MECHANISM WAS RUSTED AND NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL.  THEY ORDERED THE REPLACEMENT UNIT TO INSTALL.  IN THE MEANTIME, I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE SEVERE RUST ISSUES IN THE CAR.  THEY DID A RUST INSPECTION AND SAID IT PASSED.  IN 2014, I RETURNED TO THE SAME LOUISIANA DEALERSHIP FOR THE TAKATA RECALL.  AT THAT TIME, I TOLD THEM MY CONCERN REGARDING THE RUST, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE RUST BELT ATM LEAST 4 MONTHS A YEAR.  THEY SAID THE FRAME PASSED THE RUST INSPECTION AND PROVIDED ME WITH AN \"OPERATIONAL FLOWCHART\" FOR FRAME RUST.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT IF I FIND A HOLD IN THE FRAME LARGER THAN 10MM, IT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF.  IN 2015, THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE RUST BELT ABOUT 7 MONTHS.  THAT YEAR I HAD TO INSTALL 2X4 SUPPORTS TO HOLD UP MY LIFT GATE WINDOW.   IN 2016, THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE RUST BELT ABOUT 5 MONTHS.  IN FEBRUARY 2017, I FOUND AT LEAST 1 RUST HOLE IN THE FRAME AS PER THEIR OPERATIONAL FLOWCHART.  WHEN I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE RUST HOLE, THEIR COMMENT WAS THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO.  I SPOKE TO TOYOTA AND THEY STATED THAT THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED.      I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE ABILITY OF THIS VEHICLE TO WITHSTAND RUST.  I AM ALSO DRIVING A 1998 FORD THAT WAS IN THE RUST BELT LONGER THAN THE 2002 SEQUOIA WITH NO FRAME RUST.      THE FRAME ON THIS VEHICLE SHOULD NOT BE RUSTING AND NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY REPAIRED.    SEE THE ATTACHED PHOTO.",

THE DEALER SAID THE RUST WAS SO BAD AFTER SPRAYING IT ONCE, THAT THEY HAD TO KEEP MY TRUCK AN EXTRA DAY TO SPRAY IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER COAT (ON AREAS OTHER THAN THE FRAME AS WELL).  I CALLED THE DEALER TO SEE IF THE 2ND COATING WAS SUFFICIENT AND THEY SAID IT WAS READY TO BE PICKED UP AND THEY WOULD NOT BE REPLACING THE FRAME.  UPON PICKUP, THE COATING WAS SO THICK IT WAS DRIPPING OFF IN THE PARKING LOT.  THE DEALER SAID IT WOULD TAKE 30 DAYS TO \"CURE\".  OF COURSE, AFTER THOSE 30 DAYS IT WAS BEYOND THE TOYOTA SERVICE CAMPAIGN AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE BY THE DEALER.

SINCE I HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AN UNDER-COATING DONE BY MY MECHANIC PRIOR TO TOYOTA SENDING US THE NOTICE, I DID NOT BRING OUR VEHICLE TO TOYOTA'S REPAIR CENTER. FOR THIS REASON, TOYOTA SAID THEY COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT OUR BROKEN FRAME SINCE WE NEVER CAME IN FOR OUR UNDER-COATING.

THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS UNTIL RECENTLY DURING A RECENT RAIN STORM IT STARTED TO ACT UP AGAIN.  DRIVING THIS CAR HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE AND SCARY AT BEST.  I CAME INTO SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WITH OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING WHEN MY CAR WOULD LOOSE ALL ABILITY TO STEER AND MY BRAKES WOULD LOCK DURING SEVERAL INSTANCES.  THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A MIND GAME AND HAS TAKEN A TOLL IN MY CONFIDENCE IN DRIVING BECAUSE I BELIEVED MY DEALERSHIP WHEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS NOT THE CAR, BUT BECAUSE OF RATS, WHICH I NOW KNOW AFTER READING OTHER CUSTOMERS COMPLAINTS ON LINE THAT IT WAS THE WAY THE CAR WAS MANUFACTURED.

I HAD TO PULL OVER 5 SEPARATE TIMES DUE TO THE SAME ISSUE. LUCKILY I ALLOWED MYSELF A HUGE SPACE IN BETWEEN MYSELF AND OTHER CARS. IF NOT, THERE WOULD HAD BEEN A FOR SURE ACCIDENT.     CAR CONTINUES WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. I'VE DONE A WHOLE LOT OF RESEARCHING IN REGARDS TO THIS VEHICLE AND IT SEEMS THAT IT'S A ECU ISSUE. I AM AWARE THAT TOYOTA HAS RECALLED ALL 2003 MODEL SEQUOIA'S ON UP BUT NOT 2002 ON UNDER.     THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN OF MINE AND EVEN IF I PURCHASED A NEW ECU THERE IS NOT GUARANTEE THAT IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED OR FIXED FOR THIS MODEL. ACCORDING TO THE TOYOTA REP.

AS I DROVE AT STEADY 65MPH I NOTICED THE VEHICLE BECOME UNSTABLE, I COULD FEEL THE REAR END BEING VERY WISH-WASHY, TO THE POINT I HAD TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN TO ABOUT 55 MPH SO THAT IT WOULD FEEL MORE STABLE.  I DRIVE THIS SAME STRETCH OF FREEWAY OFTEN AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE TRUCK ACT LIKE THIS UNTIL THE LIGHTS BECAME ILLUMINATED.   I TOOK THE TRUCK TO MY MECHANIC, THEY PERFORMED SOME DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND DID SOME INVESTIGATING AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG, NO TRIPPED CODES OR ANYTHING ELSE POINTING TO SOMETHING NEEDING TO BE REPLACED.  WHILE THEY WORKED ON THE VEHICLE THEY HAD AT SOME POINT DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY, RESETTING THE COMPUTER, THIS SEEMED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM UNTIL LAST WEEK, 9/23/2013 WHEN THE LIGHTS SAME LIGHTS ILLUMINATED AGAIN. THIS SECOND TIME I NEVER NOTICED THE REAR-END BEING SLIPPERY AS I DID IN THE FIRST CASE.  THANK GOODNESS.  I WAS ON A LONG TRIP 600 MILES FROM HOME.   I WORRIED THAT WHEN THESE LIGHTS ARE ILLUMINATED THAT IF I'M REQUIRED TO DO A QUICK STOP OR MANEUVER TO AVOID SOMETHING I MAY END UP IN A REALLY BAD SITUATION.  BUT WITH THE LIGHTS BEING ILLUMINATED TWICE IN A YEAR SPAN I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THIS COULD BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM.  I'M DON'T LIKE THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF WHEN THE LIGHTS ILLUMINATE.   *TR",

CONSUMERS  WHO GET INSPECTED  AND/OR DRIVE VEHICLE ARE LIABLE IF THERE IS AN INJURY OR INCIDENT.  THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO BUY BACK VEHICLES THAT ARE RUSTED, NOT CHARGE CONSUMERS FOR THE REPAIRS AND/OR REPLACEMENT OF RUSTED PARTS  TO REPLACE FRAME. IT WOULD COST THEM LESS TO BUY BACK THEN TO REPLACE. PLEASE CONSUMERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS. TOYOTA IS NOT BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM ON THEIR SEQUOIA.  THIS IS NOT A FREE SERVICE,REPLACEMENT.  AS MANY CONSUMERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY SOMETHING TO REPLACE.  CURRENTLY THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BUY BACK, IT IS THEIR OWN REMEDY AND A GOOD ONE,AS ONCE INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE RUSTED  THE CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE. PLEASE HELP NTSB TO STOP TOYOTA FROM THIS UNFAIR PRACTICE!  FOR THOSE CONSUMERS THAT HAVE A RUSTED  OUT VEHICLE, MAKE THEM BUY IT  BACK TO KEEP THE ROADS SAFE AND THE CONSUMERS. IT  IS UNJUST AND DANGEROUS TO ALLOW THIS REMEDY TO CONTINUE  IF IT IS NOT A TOTALLY FREE REPLACEMENT INCLUDUNG THE PARTS  TO REPAIR AND  MAKE SAFE. SHOULD NOT COST ANY CONSUMER TO RECIFY THE PROBLEM,  PLEASE PLEASE INVESTIGATE  THIS!! MY VEHICLE IS NOW  WORTHLESS, AND I AM NOT  OR WILL NOT BE THE ONLY ONE. TOYOTA IS GETTING AWAY WITH SHIRKING THEIR RESPONSIBILTY  TO THE  CONSUMER WHO PURCHASED IN GOOD FAITH. PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON US!! THIS IS NOT FAIR!!! AND  IT IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE UNLAWFUL  FOR TOYOTA  TO CONDUCT BUSINESS  LIKE THIS.. THIS  IS NOT A FREE  FRAME REPLACEMENT  TO EVERY ONE. THEY SHOULD BE  COMPELLED TO REPLACE   AT NO COST TO CONSUMERS.  SOME BUT NOT ALL ARE FREE DUE TO DEGREES OF CORROSION WHICH CLEARLY IS DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE AND IF IT CANNOT BE REMEDIED BY THE FRAME REPLACEMENT, A BUY BACK SHOULD BE INSTITUTED FOR THE ABOVE.

IF THE 2003 MODEL HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND SO MANY OTHER 2002 SEQUOIA OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM, WHY SHOULDN'T OUR TRUCKS ALSO QUALIFY FOR RECALL AND DEALER REPAIR AT NO COST TO US.  MUST WE FIRST HAVE AN ACCIDENT TO WIN RIGHTS TO BE ACCOMMODATED.  DOES TOYOTA NOT WANT TO MAKE GOOD ON IT'S PRODUCT AND SATISFY ALL OWNERE/CUSTOMERS.

I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH GRAPPONE TOYOTA IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ON JULY 21ST THEY CONFIRMED THE DAMAGE AND REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  THE DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY A DEFECTIVE FRAME DESIGN THAT ALLOWS WATER TO COLLECT AND NOT DRAIN.  MY RESEARCH SHOWS THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS FRAME AS USED ON THE SEQUOIA AND TUNDRA.  IT ALSO APPARENTLY WAS A PROBLEM ON THE TACOMA WHICH HAS A SIMILAR DEFECTIVE DESIGN.    I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA US CORPORATE OFFICEBY PHONE ON THE 21ST AND WAS INFORMED THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM ON THE SEQUOIA AS REQUIRING ANY PROGRAM TO RECTIFY SUCH AS TOYOTA HAS REPORTEDLY DONE FOR THE TUNDRA AND TACOMA.  GIVEN THE UNSAFE NATURE OF THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN, AND THE IMPLICATIONS SHOULD IT FAIL ON THE ROAD, I FIND THIS UNACCEPTABLE.     I SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A REPUTABLE WELDING SHOP WHO FOUND THE DAMAGE WAS MORE EXTENSIVE AND WELDED 21 INCH LONG PLATES ON BOTH FRAME ARCHES.

I TOOK IT TO A DEALER AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY COMPUTER CODES RELATING TO THIS ISSUE. AT THE END OF LAST WINTER THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BECOME WORSE.

I CALLED TOYOTA, THEY GAVE ME A CASE # AND TOLD ME TO TAKE IT IN TO THE DEALER. I TOOK IT BACK TO A TOYOTA DEALER AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE LIGHTS TURNING ON OR FIND ANY COMPUTER CODES CONCERNING THE PROBLEM. THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 MONTHS AGO AND STILL THE PROBLEM PERSISTS LEADING UP TO YESTERDAYS ACCIDENT. I DROVE UP TO THE MOUNTAINS TO GO SNOWBOARDING. WHEN WE LEFT THE RESORT IT WAS SNOWING VERY HEAVY. I NOTICED THE ABS, VSC, AND VSC TRAC LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN, AS I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO. WE DROVE ABOUT 7 MILES DOWN THE ROAD THEN I WAS MOVING IN TO THE LEFT TURNING LANE OF A TRAFFIC LIGHT. OUR SPEED WAS ONLY 15-20 MPH, AND WHEN I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN THE WHEELS LOCKED UP AND WE BEGAN SLIDING. I LET OFF THE BRAKES AND TRIED THEM AGAIN TO NO AVAIL. I LET OFF THE BRAKES AND TRIED TO MISS THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME BY GOING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THEM OVER A SMALL MEDIAN AS THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC COMING TOWARDS US IN THE INTERSECTION.

THE PROBLEM OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY AND WHEN IT DOES OCCURS, IT HAPPENS DURING INITIAL ACCELERATION.  DURING THIS TIME, THE VSC LIGHT WOULD START BLINKING AND I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE.  BRAKING WOULD REQUIRE TREMENDOUS FORCE APPLIED TO ACTIVATE IT.    THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE INCIDENT WHERE THE VSC ACTIVATED DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING, BUT THAT INCIDENT LASTED APPROXIMATELY 5 OR SO SECONDS.  HOWEVER, IT DID REQUIRE THAT I SUDDENLY APPLY THE BRAKE AND STARTED PUMPING IT FOR THE VSC TO DE-ACTIVATE.    DUE TO THE INTERMITTENT NATURE, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THEY DID FIND THAT ERROR CODES WERE PRESENT RELATING TO THE VSC.  THOUGH THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE PINPOINTED ON THE INITIAL VISIT TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCES PROMPTED ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC.  EVENTUALLY IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME TO REPLACE THE \"SPEED SENSORS\" WHICH I AUTHORIZED.  AFTER THE REPLACEMENT, THE PROBLEM TEND TO HAVE GONE AWAY.    RECENTLY, I STARTED TO INTERMITTENTLY EXPERIENCE A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH VSC LIGHT BLINKING BRIEFLY WHENEVER I PULL OUT OF A DRIVE WAY PERFORMING AT LEAST AN 80 DEGREE TURN.

I HAVE FILED TWO COMPLAINTS WITH TOYOTA CORPORATE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND BECAUSE I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF MY PASSENGERS, I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND HAD THE \"YAW RATE SENSOR\" REPLACED.  I VISITED TWO DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA AND BOTH WERE FAMILIAR WITH SEQUOIAS (MODEL YEARS 2001-2003 AND SOME 2004) HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  MY INTERNET RESEARCH SUGGESTS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.    ACCORDING TO TOYOTA, MY YAW RATE SENSOR IS FAULTY AND IT DETECTS THAT MY CAR IS SKIDDING EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE SKID CONTROL SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THE SKID.  HOWEVER, SINCE I WASN'T SKIDDING TO BEGIN WITH, THE CORRECTION CAUSES THE CAR TO SWERVE RAPIDLY AND UNCONTROLLABLY TO THE RIGHT, GENERALLY INTO THE NEXT LANE.  I HAVE NARROWLY AVOIDED HITTING CARS SEVERAL TIMES.  TOYOTA TELLS ME THAT THERE IS ALSO A BRAKE BOOSTER PROBLEM AND THAT I MAY NEED TO REPLACE THE SKID CONTROL COMPUTER.

I DID REPLACE THE YAW RATE SENSOR, WHICH COST ME $811 AND I'M HOPING THAT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT THIS IS NOT A MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR ISSUE.

I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDS 'ABS ECU' REPLACEMENT.  FURTHERMORE, THE DEALER SAID THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE SAME WARNING LIGHTS WON'T TAKE PLACE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BASED ON THE ABS ECU REPAIR.  THE COST OF THE REPAIR IS QUOTED AT $2100.00.

IN JANUARY OF 2004, I WAS ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE AND WHEN I WENT TO STOP MY VEHICLE, MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND I WAS LUCKILY ABLE TO GET INTO THE SHOULDER AND FINALLY GET THE VEHICLE STOPPED WITHOUT HITTING ANYONE. IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER MIGHT HAVE MALFUNCTIONED. THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO A TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. WHEN I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE, IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS BACK INTO ITS NORMAL POSITION BUT THE DEALER COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY.    DURING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 12, 2010 THIS SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED TWICE AND I WAS ALMOST INVOLVED IN TWO SEPARATE ACCIDENTS. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE TOYOTA DEALER AND ONCE AGAIN THE COMPUTER AND OTHER INDICATOR LIGHTS WERE NOT SHOWING ANY PROBLEMS. AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF SITTING THERE THE BRAKES RETURNED TO THEIR NORMAL POSITION JUST LIKE BEFORE. I THEN TOOK THE MECHANIC FOR A RIDE IN A BACK LOT OF THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE THEM FAIL ONCE AGAIN.    AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE, THE BRAKES NEVER RETURNED TO THEIR NORMAL POSITIONS. I LEFT THE TRUCK AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THERE WERE NO KNOWN PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA AND HE SAID AFTER TALKING TO SEVERAL TOYOTA ENGINEERS THAT IT COULD BE A NUMBER OF THINGS:    1)MASTER CYLINDER  2)BRAKE BOOSTER  3)BRAKE ACTUATOR  4)COMPUTER  THE MECHANIC AND THE ENGINEERS FELT THAT IS WAS PROBABLY THE BRAKE ACTUATOR SO I WENT AHEAD WITH THE REPAIR. BUT THEY WERE NOT 100% SURE THAT THIS WAS THE PROBLEM. BUT THEY DID AGREE THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THE BRAKES OF COURSE ARE WORKING. I TALKED TO SEVERAL OTHER MECHANICS AND THEY HAVE SAID THAT TOYOTA KNOWS THAT THESE ACTUATORS ARE BAD BUT ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THEY ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE VSC/ECU COMPUTER MODULES ARE A DEFECT AS WELL.  *TR",

THE WINDOW WOULD OPEN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BEING DRIVEN, WHEN IT WAS STATIONARY OR EVEN WHILE IT WAS UNOCCUPIED.  THE SCARIEST HOWEVER, WAS WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BEING DRIVEN.  FORTUNATELY FOR ME AND MY FAMILY NO ONE WAS INJURED.     THE SECOND MAJOR PROBLEM OCCURRED  WITH THE DOOR LOCKS.  THE LOCKS WOULD LOCK AND UNLOCK THEMSELVES REPEATEDLY WITHOUT ANYONE TOUCHING THEM.  THIS LOCKING/UNLOCKING WOULD AGAIN TAKE PLACE WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BEING DRIVEN, STATIONARY OR EVEN UNOCCUPIED.  THE LAST COMPLAINT IS THAT THE GAS GAUGE WILL DROP TO EMPTY WITHOUT ANY REASON SO THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH GASOLINE I HAVE LEFT IN THE TANK.

I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 55 MPH ON A DRY ROAD AT NIGHT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.  I MOVED OFF THE HIGHWAY TO CHECK THE MANUAL WHICH EMPHASIZED THE POSSIBLE SERIOUSNESS OF EACH LIGHT.  IT SAID TO CONTACT A TOYOTA DEALER. I CALLED EARNHARDT TOYOTA IN MESA ARIZONA WHO FINALLY WORKED ON THE VEHICLE SEVERAL DAYS LATER FOR THE VSC/TRAC/BRAKE/ABS  PROBLEM, AND A FRONT BRAKE VIBRATION/PULSATION.  NO HELP ON THE PULSATION PROBLEM SINCE I WAS TOLD  I NEEDED TO TURN THE ROTORS AGAIN.  ON THE VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL/TRACTION CONTROL/ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM/BRAKE WARNING LIGHTS, THE SERVICE ASSOCIATE OFFERED THAT IT WAS A \"COMMON\" PROBLEM,  COULD BE CAUSED BY A LOOSE GAS CAP OR AN EXPENSIVE COMPUTER (IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS). HE SATED THAT NO \"CODES\" WERE SET OTHER THAN A \"LOW VOLTAGE\" WHICH COULD BE CAUSED BY A BAD BATTERY OR CORRODED CONNECTION. I CLEANED THE BATTERY TERMINALS COMPLETELY, CHECKED THE BATTERY, AND MADE SURE THE GAS CAP WAS TIGHT.  THE WARNING LIGHTS NOW COME ON AT SOME POINT EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE SEQUOIA.  EARNHARDT TOYOTA TOLD ME IT SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE ACTUAL BRAKING SYSTEMS.  HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT?  BEING TOLD OF A FALSE CONTINUOUS OR INTERMITTENT SAFETY WARNING LIGHT CAN LULL ONE INTO A QUESTIONABLE SENSE OF SAFETY.  THESE LIGHTS AND SAFETY SYSTEMS NEED TO WORK RELIABLY WITHOUT HAVING TOYOTA JUST SAY THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS COMMON PROBLEM. DOES IT AFFECT ACTUAL VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL AND EMERGENCY BRAKING?  ON NUMEROUS INTERNET SITES, I FIND  THIS SAME PROBLEM IS MENTIONED FREQUENTLY. ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ARE ON FILE NOW WITH THE NHTSA.  I RELY ON THE WARNING LIGHTS AND THEIR UNDERLYING SYSTEMS TO WORK AS ADVERTISED, BUT TOYOTA NOW MAKES ME DOUBT THAT RELIANCE.  DOES THERE HAVE TO BE A LARGE \"BODY COUNT\" FOR NHTSA TO ORDER A RECALL TO FIX THIS WELL KNOWN SAFETY PROBLEM? *TR",

WHEN I WOULD BE DRIVING I WOULD FEEL SOMETHING \"SLIP\" OCCASIONALLY WHEN IT WAS CHANGING GEARS. THE GEAR SHIFTER WOULD ALSO RANDOMLY BE VERY HARD TO MOVE FROM PARK TO DRIVE, OR FROM PARK TO REVERSE, ETC.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO TOYOTA SERVICE  THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING OUT OF FEAR OF DRIVING THE FAMILY AND BREAKING DOWN.  THEY HAD ME DRIVE A MECHANIC WITH ME AND OF COURSE IT DID NOT DO THE \"SLIPPING ENGINE NOISE AND THE CAR SHIFTER WENT EASILY INTO PARK AND DRIVE FOR THE SHORT TIME HE WAS WITH ME.  HE REASSURED ME IT WAS NOTHING. SO THANKSGIVING DAY I LOADED MY FAMILY INTO MY HUSBANDS MERCEDES BECAUSE I KNEW MY SEQUOIA , AND I KNEW SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT.  THIS CONTINUED ON WITH ME HAVING TO ALTER MY PLANS BECAUSE I KNEW SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT. THEN DEC. 13TH I WAS THANKFULLY BY MYSELF, ON THE 91 FWY JUST EXITED THE FAST TRACK AND WAS IN THE FAR LEFT LANE ON A BUSY SAT AFTERNOON WHEN THE ACCELERATOR JUST STOPPED MAKING THE ENGINE GO. I WAS GOING UPHILL AND LUCKILY I THOUGHT QUICKLY TO GET OVER 5 LANES OF BUSY TRAFFIC TO THE SHOULDER WITH NO ENGINE SPEED EXCEPT WHAT  WAS LEFT BEFORE IT !!!. I SAW MY LIFE PASS BEFORE ME BUT WAS LUCKY!SO AFTER A $300.00 TOW BACK TO MY DEALERSHIP, THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  $4000.00 LATER  WITH ONLY 81,000 MILES . THAT JUST IS WRONG.

THEY KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO FIX IT. YOU NEED TO MAKE THEM SINCE THEY WON'T DO IT FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR VEHICLE OWNERS...    THANKS  *TR",

A SHORT TIME LATER THE LEFT FRONT OF MY VEHICLE VIOLENTLY FELL TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE VEHICLES BEHIND ME AND WITH DIFFICULTY I STEERED TO THE CURB.

SUMMER 2005 - I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER SEQUOIA OWNERS AND HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM SPECIFIC TO MY VEHICLE ALONE.  ALL THE ISSUES ARE THE SAME:  1) AC DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 80 DEGREES. 2)  WHEN IT DOES WORK (BELOW 80 DEGREES), IT DOES NOT WORK WELL AND INTERMITTENTLY.  3)  SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THEIR VEHICLES IN FOR REPAIR WITH COSTS RANGING FROM $2300-$2900.  4)  I CANNOT DEFROST MY WINDOWS WHEN IT IS RAINING - THIS IS A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT.    MANY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA ABOUT THIS AND TOYOTA CLAIMS IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE SO A RECALL IS NOT WARRANTED.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!  BECAUSE MY AC SYSTEM DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY, I CANNOT TAKE MY FAMILY ANYWHERE ON THE ROAD FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

I WENT TO ROSEVILLE TOYOTA TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD REPLACE THE ANTENNA FOR APPROX $200, BECAUSE THE GROOVES WERE WEARING OFF, AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE MANUFACTURER TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE OF HAVING TO PAY $200. HAVING ONLY HAD THIS \"FAMILY\" CAR DRIVEN AROUND TOWN FOR 2 YEARS, I DIDN'T THINK A TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM, THUS THAT'S WHY WE KEEP BUYING TOYOTA. THE MANAGER OFFERED TO FIX IT FOR $60. I RELUCTANTLY AGREED AND FELT THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ACCOMODATE ME.  THREE MONTHS LATER, IT'S NOT OPERATING PROPERLY AGAIN. WE BROUGHT IT TO ROSEVILLE TOYOTA AGAIN, ALONG WITH A MAJOR SCHEDULED $600 TUNE-UP, AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS TIME, THE MOTOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, COSTING $325! HOW CAN A POWER ANTENNA HAVE THIS MUCH PROBLEMS ON AN EXPENSIVE CAR LIKE THE SEQUOIA? WE BOUGHT IT AS A FAMILY CAR EXPECTING NOT TO KEEP SHELLING OUT MONEY FOR A 2 1/2-YEAR-OLD CAR. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP PAYING LITTLE FIXES LIKE THIS FOR A CAR WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A QUALITY BUY. WE EXPECTED PAYING FOR THE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, BUT ITS PRECISELY AVOIDING THIS \"MISC FIXES\" IS THE REASON WE BUY TOYOTA. NOW WE HAVE TO KEEP PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT REALLY KEEP BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE IMPLIED QUALITY. THE SIGN OF A GOOD QUALITY CAR IS THE AMOUNT OF LITTLE FIXES THAT NEED TO BE DONE WHICH SHOULD BE NIL.

MY CONCERN AS A CONSUMER THAT TOYOTA DID NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE TO USE A PLASTIC DOOR HANDLE AND MECHANISM AND GIVEN THAT THINGS BREAK SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF 300.00 TO REPLACE.  I CONTEND THAT METAL PARTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF THE HANDLES.  CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE MERCY OF CAR MANUFACTURES TO PUT ANYTHING INTO A CAR THAT WOULD UTIMATELY WOULD PROVE NOT IN THE CONSUMERS BEST INTEREST.  I AM SUGGESTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL TOYOTA' DOOR HANDLES.  PARTICULARLY THE TRUCK WHICH BY DESIGN ARE SUPPOSE TO ENDURE TOUGH USESAGE.",
