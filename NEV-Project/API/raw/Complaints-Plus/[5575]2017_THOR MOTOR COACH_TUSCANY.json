A FINE SPRAY OF RAW FUEL WAS SPRAYING DIRECTLY ONTO THE DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER (DPF). THE DPF WHEN IN REGENERATION MODE CAN REACH TEMPERATURES OF UP TO 500 DEGREE F. FORTUNATELY, THE EXHAUST SYSTEM WAS COLD AT START UP, BUT HAD IT BEEN IN RUNNING FOR A WHILE AND  WENT INTO IN REGENERATION MODE, A FIRE COULD HAVE RESULTED CONSIDERING THE FINE MIST THAT WAS BEING SPRAYED ONTO THE EXHAUST. I IMMEDIATELY REMOVE AND REPLACED THE FILTER THE NEXT DAY. UNFORTIONATELY I DID NOT RETAIN THE DEFECTIVE FILTER. I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A SIMILAR RECALL (QRMA FTDM-9M5HB6) BUT WAS NOT FOR A SPLIT IN THE SIDE OF THE HOUSING.",
