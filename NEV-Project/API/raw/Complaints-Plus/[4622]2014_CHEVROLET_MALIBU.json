PURCHASED 9/15/2014 FROM GEORGE HAHAS CHEVROLET IN WILDWOOD, FL.  THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH ~23,300 MILES ON IT.  IN OCTOBER 2019, THE VEHICLE BEGAN RUNNING ROUGH AT 20-25 MILES PER HOUR (ODOMETER: ~21,000) AND THE VEHICLE ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON.  THE ENGINE GAS MILEAGE ALSO DECREASED.  I TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIR AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ROCKER ARM VALVE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED (UNDER WARRANTY).  IN ADDITION, THE ENGINE WOULD NEED TO BE CLEANED DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE CARBON BUILD UP DUE TO THE MALFUNCTIONING PART.  THIS CLEAN-UP WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CAUSED BY A DEFECTIVE WARRANTED PART.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THE ENGINE LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH.  AT THAT POINT I WAS TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED AS IT WOULD NO LONGER BE DRIVABLE.  THIS REPAIR WAS ATTEMPTED DURING THE GM WORKER STRIKE AND THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  AFTER THE STRIKE, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE FROM GM OR ANY AFTERMARKET MANUFACTURER.  AFTER WAITING UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, I AGAIN CONTACTED NAHAS CHEVROLET AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE, AND GM HAD NO PLANS TO PRODUCE IT.  FURTHER, A WARRANTED PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE FROM ANY  MANUFACTURER.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT OVER 20 VEHICLES AT THIS SINGLE DEALERSHIP NEEDED THIS SAME PART.   ON MARCH 2, 2020 I CONTACTED GM CONSUMER SERVICES (CASE # 9-5847264087).  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WERE INFORMED THAT GM HAD NO PLANS TO MAKE THIS PART AND KNEW OF NO AFTERMARKET MANUFACTURER WHO COULD SUPPLY A WARRANTED PART.  THEY TOLD ME OF THREE UNWARRANTED MANUFACTURERS, BUT IF THE PART EVER CAUSED FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE, THE REPAIRS WOULD NOT BE UNDER WARRANTY.

WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED WORKING  MY CAR WAS AT HIGH SPEED 70 MPH AND THERE WAS VERY HIGH RISK OF AN ACCIDENT.

HE SAID THIS SHOULD HAPPEN AT 59,000 MILES (MY CAR MILEAGE) . I FOUND TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT THE ISSUE AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ISSUE NHTSA SHOULD CONSIDER PUTTING THIS UNDER RECALL.

THE RECALL NUMBER I FOUND FOR THAT WAS #13V567000 AND THE RECALL CAME OUT ON 11-13-2013. THE EXACT DESCRIPTION FOR THIS RECALL STATES, ''THE HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) CONTROL IN THESE VEHICLES MAY INTERMITTENTLY BECOME INOPERABLE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED, PREVENTING THE WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER FROM WORKING. THUS, THESE VEHICLES FAIL TO CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD (FMVSS) NO. 103, \"WINDSHIELD DEFROSTING AND DEFOGGING SYSTEMS.\"' MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN 09-2013. THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING IS I AM ONLY ABLE INTERMITTENTLY TURN ON MY AIR CONDITIONING, HEAT, AND DEFROST SYSTEM. SOMETIMES IT WILL TURN ON WHEN I TURN THE KNOB WITH THE FAN ICON, AND SOMETIMES IT WON'T TURN ON AT ALL, EVEN FOR PERIODS OF OVER 24 HOURS. NOT ONLY DOES THIS MEAN I CAN NO LONGER CONFIDENTLY CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CAR, BUT I CAN'T ALWAYS USE MY DEFROST OPTION EITHER WHICH CREATES A MAJOR VISIBILITY SAFETY ISSUE. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE CAR IS IN MOTION OR IF IT IS PARKED FOR THIS TO OCCUR. WHEN THE SYSTEM DOES TURN ON, EVERYTHING WORKS FINE. THIS IS A CAR I'M STILL PAYING ON AND I'M NOT EVEN GAURAUNTEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS BASIC SAFETY FUNCTION WHEN NEEDED. I CONTACTED MY DEALER AND GAVE MY VIN NUMBER TO THEM, AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME THEY SAID MY SPECIFIC CAR WAS NOT APART OF THE 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU RECALL. I'M ASKING IF MY INCIDENT COULD PLEASE BE INVESTIGATED AND RECONSIDERED AS PART OF THE RECALL CONSIDERING MY ISSUE MATCHES THE EXACT DESCRIPTION OF IT.

EVEN WHEN IT DOES LOCK EARLIER, IT ALLOWS TOO MUCH TRAVEL, I.E. 1/3 DISTANCE TO WHEEL. UNDER MODERATE BRAKING, BEFORE ENOUGH DECELERATION OCCURS TO LOCK THE BELT, THE DRIVER CAN TRAVEL VERY FAR FORWARD AND IT'S HARD TO HOLD ONESELF BACK. EVEN WHEN READY FOR THAT, THE FORCE NEEDED IS A DISTRACTION FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE ROAD AND MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO STEER.  ALSO, EXPERTS HAVE SAID THAT BEING TENSE DURING A COLLISION MAKES INJURIES WORSE OR MORE LIKELY.    THE COMPLAINANT HAS TESTED THIS MANY TIMES UNDER STRAIGHT BRAKING ON 25-45 MPH ROADS WITH THE SEAT AS FAR BACK AS IS DRIVABLE AND THE WHEEL AS FAR AWAY AS PRACTICAL FOR A SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE SIZE GUY. UNDER MODERATE BRAKING, THE BELT LOCKED WITH MY HEAD 1 INCH FROM THE WHEEL. IF A COLLISION FOLLOWED, MY HEAD WOULD HIT THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE AIR BAG WOULD DEPLOY AT NEARLY POINT-BLANK RANGE TO HEAD AND CHEST.    THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT HAS AN ALTERNATE MODE ACTIVATED BY PULLING THE BELT ALL THE WAY OUT, WHICH ACTIVATES A RETRACT-ONLY RATCHET SO IT WILL HOLD THE PASSENGER CLOSE TO THE SEAT UNTIL RELEASED. THE DRIVER'S BELT DOES NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE.    SUGGEST CRASH TESTING WITH BRAKING FROM 70 TO 40 MPH JUST PRIOR TO COLLISION RATHER THAN CRUISING INTO THE BARRIER AT STEADY 40. WITH THE 2014 MALIBU'S RESTRAINTS, THE DUMMY COULD EASILY BE 1/3 TO FULLY AGAINST THE WHEEL AT MOMENT OF COLLISION.    THE PERSON SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT DOES NOT FEEL AT ALL SAFE WHILE DRIVING WITH THIS DEFECT IN THE PRIMARY DRIVER RESTRAINT SYSTEM.

THIS COULD CAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL TO STICK IN THE STRAIGHT-AHEAD POSITION AFTER DRIVING LONG DISTANCES ON A STRAIGHT HIGHWAY. THE STEERING WHEEL CAN BE TURNED BUT IT MAY REQUIRE INCREASED EFFORT.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE TO YOUR CHEVROLET DEALER AS A RESULT OF THIS LETTER UNLESS YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR VEHICLE HAS THE CONDITION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\"    I AM FILING THIS SAFETY COMPLAINT TO HAVE THE 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU RECALLED.  THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  ALTHOUGH I AM NOT EXPERIENCING ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY STEERING, THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WANT HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

IT TOOK EFFORT TO KEEP THE CAR FROM JERKING.  INITIALLY THIS WOULD OCCUR ONLY WHEN TEMPERATURES WERE BELOW APPROXIMATELY 50 DEGREES (WE WERE ON CHRISTMAS BREAK IN UTAH).

THIS AFTERNOON I OBSERVED THE SAME \"STICKINESS\" WHILE WAITING AT A STOPLIGHT.
