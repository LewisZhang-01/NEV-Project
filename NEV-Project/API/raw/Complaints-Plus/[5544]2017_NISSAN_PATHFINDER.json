Given the need for heat to defrost windows as well as safetly operate in the winter with children in the car, it is unsafe to use the vehicle until this mater can be resolved, as without the radiator fans the engine could overheat as well.

SURPRISINGLY THIS HASN'T BEEN RECALLED YET OR NISSAN HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

YOU CANNOT DRIVE THE CAR FOR TOO LONG BEFORE THE BURNING SMELL STARTS BOTHERING YOU AND GIVING YOU HEADACHES. ONCE THE COOLING FAN GOES BAD, IT ALSO SPILLS SOME SHORT OF LIQUID IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WHICH CAN CAUSE THE BURNING SMELL TO STILL BE AROUND FOR 1-2 WEEK EVEN AFTER GETTING THE COOLING FAN REPLACED.
