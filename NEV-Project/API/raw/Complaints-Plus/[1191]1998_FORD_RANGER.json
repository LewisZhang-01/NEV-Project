THINKING WE HAD A FLAT, WE STARTED TO MOVE OVER TO THE RIGHT AND EXIT THE FREEWAY.  AT AROUND LANE 3 I COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  IT FISH-TAILED TWICE AND THEN FLIPPED OVER AND SLID INTO THE ICEPLANT ALONG THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.  THE TRUCK THEN RIGHTED ITSELF AND WE ENDED UP FACING N/B ON THE SHOULDER.  WE COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN KILLED!!!  MY WIFE SUSTAINED SOME BUMPS AND BRUISES BUT IS OTHERWISE OK.  I WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH.  ON INSPECTING THE TIRE (WHICH WE NOW HAVE IN OUR POSSESION) WE NOTICED THAT THE SIDEWALL HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE TIRE!!  MY WIFE AND I ARE CONVINCED THAT THESE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS HT TIRES ARE UNSAFE!!!  WE HAVE PHOTOS OF THE TRUCK AND WE SAVED THE TIRE.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS - PLEASE CALL US ANYTIME.

I HAD EARLIER NOTICED STRANGE WEAR PATTERNS, BUT MY DEALER INFORMED ME THIS WAS NORMAL.  THE RIGHT REAR TIRE COMPLETELY CAME APART LEAVING ONLY THE SIDEWALLS -- THE TREAD DETACHED COMPLETELY.

THE DEALER KEPT THE FAULTY TIRE SO I CANNOT PROVIDE IT FOR INSPECTION.  THANKFULLY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED ALTHOUGH IT WAS QUITE SCARY WHEN THE VEHICLE LOST COMPLETE CONTROL.  THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY DANGER OF ROLLOVER, BUT MY PICKUP BED WAS EMPTY AT THE TIME SO I'M UNSURE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER WITH A FULL LOAD.  I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE NO LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST THE MANUFACTUROR, BUT MY EXPERIENCE IS SIMILAR TO THE RECENT REPORTS I'VE BEEN HEARING.  I HOPE THIS INFO ASSISTS YOU IN YOUR INVESTIGATION.

THEY BLAME IT ON THE NON ASBESTOS CONTENT OF THE SHOES. ALL THEY DID WAS CLEAN OUT THE DRUMS AND SAND THE SHOES. THEY SAID THERE IS NO KNOWN REPAIR OTHER THAN THIS.I HAVE NOW MOVED TO BANGOR SO I HAVE MY TRUCK SERVICED AT DARLINGS FORD 403 HOGAN ROAD BANGOR MAINE 04401 PHONE 1-800-540-1339. SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT IN FEB. 98 I'VE HAD THE TRUCK IN TO DARLING'S TWICE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM . THEY TREATED THE PROBLEM IN THE SAME WAY, STILL NO PERMANENT FIX. I ASKED IF FORD WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM AT NO CHARGE AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE. THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT AND I SHOULD TALK TO THE DEALER AS THEY MAY DO IT AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE ON THIS VEHICLE AS I TRAVEL 60 MILES TO WORK IN ALL WEATHER AND IT'S DANGEROUS TO HAVE THE REAR BRAKES GRAB WHEN DRIVING ON ICE . I'VE HAD SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF NEARLY LOSING CONTROL WHEN APPLYING VERY SLIGHT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES AND THE REAR BRAKES LOCKED. I'VE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS IN THE SUMMER DURING DAMP WEATHER ON NEARLY DRY ROADS WHEN THE REAR BRAKES LOCKED UP CAUSING THE ANTI LOCK SYSTEM TO COME IN AND GREATLY INCREASING THE STOPPING DISTANCE.  THE LAST FORD TRUCK I OWNED WAS A 1987 MODEL IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH WAS FINALLY CURED BY INSTALLING BRAKE SHOES CONTAINING ASBESTOS BY ME. I 'M TOLD BY DARLINGS THESE TYPE OF BRAKE SHOES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE.I SHOULD THINK THAT AFTER 11 YEARS FORD COULD COME UP WITH A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.I THINK THIS IS AN ACCIDENT JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.

THE PROBLEM, TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE GAS HAS NO EFFECT ON VEHICLE SPEED. IF TRAFFIC IS SLOWING IN FRONT OF ME, TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE GAS IS THE NORMAL THING TO DO IN ORDER TO START SLOWING DOWN AND NOT HITTING TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF ME. THIS VEHICLE WILL KEEP ON GOING AND BRAKE APPLICATION IS REQUIRED. AS A FURTHER EXAMPLE. COMING TO A RED LIGHT OR STOP SIGN, THE ENGINE WILL WANT TO RACE ABOVE 2000 UNTIL THE VEHICLE COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP. IT TAKES ABOUT 4 SECONDS AFTER THE STOP BEFORE THE COMPUTER WILL SLOW THE ENGINE. I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER TWICE. BOTH TIMES, THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT A PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THIS ENGINE/TRANSMISSION COMBINATION. HOWEVER, THEIR TESTING EQUIPMENT SHOWS NO PROBLEMS. THEY HAVE REPORTED IT TO FORD BUT CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL FORD ISSUES A PROGRAMMING CHANGE FOR THE COMPUTER. ONE TIME LAST SUMMER, AT A STOP SIGN, THE ENGINE DECIDED TO GO FROM 2000 TO 3600 RPM AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT WAS TO KILL THE ENGINE. FORD SEEMS UNWILLING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY CONCERN.  AS AN ADDITIONAL TEST, I GOT ON THE INTERSTATE, GOT UP TO SPEED, PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL, AND TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS. THE ENGINE SPEED REMAINED CONSTANT AT 2800. EVEN TOUCHING THE BRAKE AND SLOWING THE VEHICLE DOWN A SMALL AMOUNT, HAD NO EFFECT ON ENGINE SPEED DURING THIS TEST. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO NOT BE PRESENT WHEN THE ENGINE IS COLD.
