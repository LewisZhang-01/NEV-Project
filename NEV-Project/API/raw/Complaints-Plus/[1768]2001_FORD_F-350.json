IN TOO MANY CONVERSATIONS TO RECALL, THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION HAS BEEN THE 2001 FORD F-350 TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE EITHER ENCOUNTERED THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR OWN TRUCK OR KNOWS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS.  WE BEGAN EXPERIENCING MINOR PROBLEMS AT AROUND 17,000 MILES WHICH INCREASINGLY GOT WORSE.  THE PLANETARY (SP?) GEAR IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD WAS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THAT FORD HAS PINPOINTED WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS.  THE NUMBER OF TRANSMISSION SHIPPING CASES ALONE,  FOUND IN BACK OF THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE HAD OUR TRUCK REPAIRED INDICATIVE OF A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM NOT BEING ADDRESSED BY FORD.  FROM WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED, THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR UNTIL YOUR MILEAGE IS ABOVE 15,000.
