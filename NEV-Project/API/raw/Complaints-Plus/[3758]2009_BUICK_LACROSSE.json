OPEN THE HOOD.  A FEW MOMENTS LATER I SAW SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE HOOD AND THE COMPUTER SAID SOMETHING LIKE 'SYSTEM FAILURE'.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER, TURNED OFF THE CAR AND TOOK THE KEYS.  THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WERE STILL MOVING EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS OFF AND KEYS WERE OUT OF THE IGNITION.  A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER FROM LOCAL AREA SAW MY CAR, PULLED OVER, OPENED THE HOOD AND USED AN EXTINGUISHER ON THE FUSE BOX WHICH WAS SMOKING BADLY ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T SEE FLAMES.  HE DISCONNECTED THE CABLES ON THE FUSE BOX,  LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND NY STATE TROOPER ARRIVED.  MY CAR WAS TOWED TO MY MECHANICS GARAGE.  WE HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT THE FUSE BOX WAS DISTROYED WITH MOST DAMAGE TO THE HDM RELAY AS POSITION #35 IS SEVERELY DAMAGED.  I BELIEVE THIS IS ALSO NEXT TO THE WINDSHIELD WIPER RELAY WHICH IS WHY THEY WENT ON.  ALSO 3 MAJOR WIRING HARNESSES WERE MELTED AND DESTROYED.  WE DON'T KNOW IF THE COMPUTER OR ANY OTHER FEATURE UNDER THE HOOD IS AFFECTED AT THIS TIME.  THE DAMAGE AT THIS POINT IS ESTIMATED TO BE $4,000 IN PARTS AND LABOR NOT INCLUDING POSSIBLE COMPUTER DAMAGE.  I HAVE SEEN ON THE INTERNET THAT MY CAR IS INCLUDED IN RECALL N140291 LOSS OF LOW BEAM HDM DATED 11/25/14 BUT THAT GM 'WILL' PROVIDE A PLAN FOR REMEDYING THE DEFECT.

THE PROBLEM DOES OCCUR DURING THE DAYTIME AS WELL BUT IF THE SUN IS OUT IT IS NOT SUCH A BIG PROBLEM.  I HAVE TALKED TO FRIENDS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLES.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BUT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET GM OR MY CAR DEALERSHIP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM EXISTS.  I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR AT NIGHT OR WHEN THERE IS A RAINSTORM BECAUSE I PANIC WHEN I HAVE NO INTERNAL LIGHTS OR CAN SEE THE SPEED I AM TRAVELING AT.

EVENTUALLY, AS I WAS DRIVING ALONG SOME TIME LATER, THE MESSAGE \"REDUCED ENGINE POWER\" CAME UP; AND I COULD FEEL THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY START TO DRAG.  IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE, \"TRACTION CONTROL OFF\" OR SOMETHING SIMILAR COMES UP.  I STOPPED TO LOOK AT THE MANUAL WHICH SAID TO SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN START THE CAR AND THIS WOULD CLEAR THE CODE SO THAT THE CAR WOULD RUN NORMALLY.  I DID THIS, AND I SAW THAT THE CAR WAS OPERATING MORE NORMALLY BUT THE \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" STAYED ON.  AFTER SEVERAL STOPS AND STARTS, THE LIGHT WENT OFF.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.  ON 6/3, I TOOK IT TO A DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY.  THE ONLY THING THEY COULD FIND THAT MIGHT BE CAUSING IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY WORKED ON THE X101 CONNECTOR AND TEST DROVE IT 16 MILES W/O A PROBLEM.  TWO DAYS LATER WHILE DRIVING TO WORK (AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 20 MIN.), THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN.  ANOTHER GARAGE WHERE I HAD MY OIL CHANGED RAN THE CODES AND FOUND THAT P1125 - FUEL & AIR METERING AND P2138 THROTTLE/PEDAL POSITION WERE LISTED.  I GAVE THIS INFO TO THE BUICK DEALER TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM COULD BE FIXED.  THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY EXCEPT FOR EMISSION CONTROLS, SO I PAID FOR THE WORK.

WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT ABOUT 11:00PM ON A RAINY NIGHT I WAS STOPPED BY A STATE TROOPER WHO SAID MY HEADLIGHTS SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING.  THE GOOD PART IS- THE TROOPER ACTUALLY SAW MY HEADLIGHTS WERE ORIGINALLY ON BUT HE STATED THAT AS I APPROACHED HIM \"THEY JUST WENT OFF\".  HE PULLED ME OVER JUST TO MAKE SURE I WAS OK, BUT HE SAID THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND I COULD CAUSE A COLLISION WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS. FUNNY THING IS, THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS WORKED JUST FINE, BUT THE LOW BEAM -REGULAR HEADLIGHTS WOULD NOT COME ON AT ALL.  THEN, IRONICALLY, WHILE HE WAS RUNNING MY DRIVERS LICENSE,MY HEADLIGHTS POPPED BACK ON.  THIS IS VERY SCARY.    THIS INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO ME MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE DRIVING THIS CAR AT NIGHT, AND MOST RECENTLY ON A CLEAR SUMMER NIGHT, I WAS ON A HIGHWAY WHICH HAD NO STREET LAMPS AND ONCE AGAIN, THE LOW BEAM HEADLAMPS COMPLETELY SHUT OFF, LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE IT SINCE I WAS THE ONLY CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AND  THAT WAS MY ONLY LIGHT, SO I IMMEDIATELY CUT MY HIGH BEAM LIGHTS ON, BUT AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  THE BRIGHT LAMPS WORKED PROPERLY, BUT MY REGULAR HEADLAMPS WOULD NOT CUT ON AT ALL. I PULLED INTO A GAS STATION AND AFTER ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES, THE HEADLIGHTS EVENTUALLY TURNED BACK ON WITHOUT ME DOING ANYTHING. AS OF TODAY, I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR AT NIGHT UNLESS I HAVE THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS ON BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO CUT OFF.  THE PROBLEM IS I DISTRACT OTHER DRIVERS WITH MY HIGH BEAM HEADLIGHTS SO IT CAUSES ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE.
