THE PASSIVE RESTRAINTS (SEATBELTS) FAILED TO LOCK IN PLACE, AND THE DRIVER-SIDE AIRBAG WAS NOT DEPLOYED.  THE ALTIMA WAS STRUCK IN THE REAR, DRIVER-SIDE QUARTER PANEL/BUMPER - AREA SURROUNDING FUEL CAP.  ODDLY ENOUGH, AFTER THE BODY WORK WAS COMPLETED, THE MERCURY SWITCH THAT IS DESIGNED TO LOCK THE PASSIVE RESTRAINTS IN PLACE DURING A CRASH HAD BEEN TRIPPED AND REQUIRED REPLACEMENT BY THE DEALER.  WHEN THE PASSIVE RESTRAINT SENSOR WAS REPLACED BY THE DEALER UPON PICKING UP THE ALTIMA I NOTICED A RED AIRBAG LIGHT SOLIDLY ILLUMINATED ON THE DASH.  WHEN I QUESTIONED THE DEALER ABOUT THIS CONDITION THAT DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO THEIR REPLACEMENT OF THE PASSIVE RESTRAINT SENSOR IN THE TRUNK, THEY INVESTIGATED.  THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE LIGHT GO OFF, BUT INDICATED THAT THE \"AIRBAG CONTROLLER CARD (ACC)\" ESSENTIALLY A CIRCUIT BOARD WAS FAULTY - OR WOULD WORK INTERMITTENTLY UNLESS I REPLACED IT.  THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED THAT THE REASON IT WORKED INTERMITTENTLY WAS BECAUSE THE \"ACC\" WAS NOT SEALED AND AS A RESULT WAS PRONE TO TOTAL FAILURE ON A VERY HOT OR COLD DAY.  THE MANAGER INDICATED FURTHER THAT WHEN HE HAD BEEN A MECHANIC HE HAD SEEN MANY ALTIMA'S, SENTRA'S AND A FEW OTHER MODELS THAT USED THE SAME VERSION \"ACC\" AND THAT NISSAN HAD BEEN REPLACING THEM ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.  HOWEVER, THEY CHOSE TO TELL ME THAT \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\" WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE, AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER REPLACEMENT UNDER WARRANTY OR EVEN OUTSIDE WARRANTY DESPITE IT BEING A SAFETY ISSUE. NISSAN INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS PART, AND THEY HAD NO RECORD OF THIS PART HAVING A HISTORY OF FAILURE.  I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT IF MY AIRBAG IS GOING TO WORK OR NOT THE HARD WAY.*AK",
