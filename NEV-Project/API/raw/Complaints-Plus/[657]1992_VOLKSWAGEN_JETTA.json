I WAS TRAVELING TO CROWN POINT FROM LAFAYETTE USING HIGHWAY 65 NORTH (60-65 MPH -WITH THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC), WHEN 3/4 MILES AWAY FROM RENESELAER THE ACCELERATOR CABLE FROZE STILL HALFWAY. IT WOULD NOT RELEASE TO THE FULL POSITION, NOR WILL IT DEPRESS PAST HALFWAY. AT THAT MOMENT, THE ENGINE REVVED AND STARTED SPEEDING UP. I WATCHED WITH PANIC AS MY JETTA'S SPEEDOMETER READ 67, 70, 72 AND 75 PROGRESSIVELY. TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN, I STEPPED ON THE BREAKS GRADUALLY; WHICH HELPED A LITTLE, BUT NOT BY MUCH. I HAD JUST PASSED THE \"1/4 MILE TO RENESELEAR\" EXIT NUMBER 215, WHICH MERGES WITH HIGHWAY 114. SEEING THE EXIT AHEAD (AND STILL STEPPING ON THE BRAKES TO SLOW ME DOWN), I TURNED INTO THE EXIT AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE EXIT, I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND ROLLED TO A STOP AT THE STOP SIGN ON TOP OF THE HILL EXIT. BEFORE I STOPPED COMPLETELY, I BEGAN TO SMELL MY BRAKE PADS SMELTING. AND WHEN I DID ROLL TO STOP, THERE WAS SMOKE RISING FROM THE FRONT WELLS. I GOT OUT AND POPPED THE HOOD TO INSPECT FURTHER AND TO CHECK MY TIRES. AS I BENT DOWN TO CHECK THE WHEELS, I NOTICED MY ROTORS WERE BOTH RED HOT. CHECKING THE LEFT WHEEL, AFTER INSPECTING THE RIGHT, REVEALED A SMALL LIP OF FLAME RIGHT NEXT TO THE BRAKE ROTOR. I THEN GRABBED A FULL BOTTLE OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID AND EMPTIED IT ON BOTH ROTORS. THE THOUGHT OF LOSING MY BELOVED CAR TO A FIRE AND A HUGH EXPLOSION -MY GAS TANK WAS COMPLETELY FULL AT THE MOMENT- WAS MORBIDLY PETRIFYING. THE FIRE WAS QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED AFTER I POURED IT ON THE FLAMES. TO MY WEST, ABOUT ~ 1000 METERS, WAS A SHELL GAS STATION WITH KELLY'S TIRES RIGHT BEFORE IT, WHERE I ASKED FOR HELP. A KIND TECHNICIAN -FROM KELLY'S TIRES- INFORMED ME, AFTER INSPECTING MY CAR, THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW ACCELERATOR CABLE BEFORE ANY WORK IS DONE.
