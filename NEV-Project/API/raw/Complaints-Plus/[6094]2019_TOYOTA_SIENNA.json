        "summary": "I own a 2019 Toyota Sienna with 52,200 kms.  I bought it January 29, 2021. On Saturday, June 26, 2021, I was exiting the Quebec to L\u00e9vis ferry on the L\u00e9vis side.  As I went up the metal ramp at 10-12 km/hr, ALL the airbags suddenly deployed with a great boom.  We hit nothing.  ALL The front and side airbags deployed.  The front windshield was broken and one of the side windows was totally shattered.  In fact it was not there any more.  Pieces of broken glass flew all over the car and hit us. The vehicle filled up with smoke.  On board was my wife and I and our two special needs sons.  We had to hurriedly get them unstrapped and hand them to ferry workers on the outside. I was the only one injured.  I received the airbag straight in my face and it hurt my neck.  I have had a headache and neck ache ever since (today is June 29). I ignore the reason for which the airbags deployed.  But I do know that Toyota has had to recall other 2019 Siennas for spontaneous deployment of their airbags.  Maybe it is an airbag defect.  My vehicle was still under warranty. The fire department and police were on the scene.  The Levis Ferry director wrote a report. The Levis police report is LVS-210626-008.  Thank you.",

THIS OCCURS AT WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS PARKING LOT SPEEDS, 5 TO 25 MPH, PRIMARILY, ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE HESITATES AND THEN LURCHES ALSO AT HIGHER SPEEDS WHEN DOWNSHIFTING TO GAIN TORQUE IN A 30-50 MPH RANGE ALSO.    THIS HESITATION, BALKING, AND THEN RAPID LURCHING FORWARD AT LOW SPEEDS HAS CAUSED PASSENGERS TO COMMENT ABOUT \"WHIPLASH\" AND BEING PUSHED BACK INTO THEIR SEATS WHEN THE VEHICLE DOES ENGAGE WITH UNEXPECTED FORWARD MOTION.    THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED ON 2-18-2019. AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MILES I CONTACTED OUR SALES AGENT WHO SET A SERVICE APPOINTMENT FOR MONDAY FEB 25, 2019.    ON 2-25-2019 I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPT WITH \"MILEAGE IN\" OF 250 MI. AND \"MILEAGE OUT\" OF 251.    SERVICE INVOICE NUMBER 784852 STATES THAT THE ECU WAS CALIBRATED AND RESET.     UPON DRIVING THE VEHICLE IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE NO DIFFERENT AND PERHAPS WORSE. ON MARCH 1, 2019 I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND TOOK THE SERVICE MANAGER AND A TECH-EXPERT FOR A RIDE. THE TECH ACKNOWLEDGED THE STALL AND LURCH PHENOMENON AND SAID HE \"HAS DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE\".     THE TECH AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THEY WERE OPENING A CASE WITH TOYOTA FOR POSSIBLE INPUT TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.    I BELIEVE THIS A SERIOUS POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE AS THE FORWARD LURCHING OF THE VEHICLE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY AS A RESULT VEHICLE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING. OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS HAVE DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM VIA INTERNET FORUMS. IT WOULD APPEAR TO AFFECT 2018 & 2019 SIENNAS WITH \"THROTTLE BY WIRE\" DESIGN AND THEIR 8 SPEED TRANSMISSION.",
