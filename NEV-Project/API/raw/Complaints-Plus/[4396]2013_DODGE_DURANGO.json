        "summary": "My 2012 Dodge Durango was serviced under NHTSA Campaign 19-V813.  This called for the replacement of the fuel pump relay to correct a potential no-start or stall situation.  This also prevented fuel pump failure due to the unit not being switched off by the TIPM when the car is turned off.  This repair has not corrected the problem.    The car would be available for inspection upon request.  The safety of the occupants could be at risk.  The problem is intermittent and has not been able to be duplicated at the dealer.   There are no warning lamps or codes that can be read.    The car will crank over for an extended period of time but will not start.  This is an intermittent problem and occurs two times a month or more, has been happening since Fall of 2020, and has been increasing in frequency.  The fuel pump relay was replaced in June 2021 and the car had a no-start two weeks later.  The check engine light does not come on.  No codes are found by the dealer.  The engine has not quit while in motion, but possibly could as this problem increases in frequency.  On two occasions while the car was in motion the right rear window went down for no reason.  The window could not be raised until the car was brought to a stop, turned off and started again.  The window could then be raised using the driver's door control.  This poses a danger to the occupants of the vehicle especially during severe weather and is at least a distraction to the driver.  The common denominator in these two problems is the TIPM.  I think the fuel pump relay problem is actually a problem found deeper within the TIPM.  Chrysler is simply saying that the \"flix\" is a relay and not the real culprit, the much more expensive TIPM.  The dealer says they cannot diagnose this problem unless it is happening on their lot.  They have inspected the fuel pump relay work that was done under recall and said that the installation was correct.",

On June 21, 2021 I scheduled an appointment   with my local World Chrysler Dodge Jeep store to have the recall performed.  For approxmimately 1 month, other than sluggishness, the car functioned normally.  In the July, the car began stalling for no reason again.  The recall performed on the vehicle HAS NOT corrected the issue with the Fuel Pump Relay.  I had once incident in June 2021 where the car stalled in the middle of an intersection and I was in serious danger of being hit by other vehicles travelling toward my car.  I was fortunate that there were a few people who pushed my car off to the side of the road.  This past week alone, my car has had three incidences when I start the car, the engine turns over, and then immediately stalls.  You cannot immediately restart because the engine will just crank, but not turn over.  You must wait a few minutes before you can restart the vehicle.  There are the same issues I was experiencing before the new relay pumb was replaced.  In my opinion, in addition to the stalling, the new relay has made my car run very sluggish.  It is not very responsive when pressing my foot on the gas pedal, it bogs down first, and then it begins to respond.  It has been dangerous when I am trying to enter a busy roadway and need the vehicle to go quickly so I can merge in to traffic.  It just bogs down.  This is not just a one time incident, the car has stalled at least 5 times since the replacement in June 2021.  Today alone, August 28, 2021 it started/stalled twice.  No inspection of the component has been done.  I tried to get a second new replacement but was told that too many people were on the waiting list, and there weren't enough new parts to redo the work already done on my vehicle.  No warning lights of any kind come on and there are no other symptoms of the proble before it occurs. No one has been able to reproduce the problem.",

I PULLED INTO A DRIVEWAY OF A BUSINESS (WITHOUT POWER STEERING) AND PARKED. I WAS GOING TO CHECK TO SEE IF EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL AND SEE IF MAYBE THE FUEL PUMP RELAY HAD AN ISSUE. MY FUEL PUMP RELAY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPAIRED IN 2015 DUE TO NHTSA RECALL # 15V-115. HOWEVER, IN MAY 2019, THE CAR STOPPED RUNNING WHEN IT WAS DRIVING 70MPH DOWN AN INTERSTATE. I WAS INFORMED BY DODGE THAT THE FUEL PUMP RELAY WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE PREVIOUS RECALL FOR A SECOND TIME BECAUSE IT HAD EXPIRED AFTER 2 YEARS. IN NOVEMBER 2019, I RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL NOTIFICATION FOR THE FUEL PUMP RELAY (NHTSA RECALL # 19V-813); HOWEVER, IT WAS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.     WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR, I SMELLED BURNING RUBBER BUT DID NOT OBSERVE ANY SMOKE. AFTER I WAS ABLE TO POP THE HOOD, I SAW A SMALL FLAME IN THE AREA OF THE ALTERNATOR. I IMMEDIATELY GOT MY TWO CHILDREN (AGES 3 AND 6) OUT OF THE CAR AND CALLED 911. MY HUSBAND ARRIVED BEFORE THE FIRE TRUCK, BUT THE 911 OPERATOR TOLD US NOT TO TRY TO PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER HE BROUGHT. THE CAR WAS A TOTAL LOSS BY THE TIME THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT BY FIREFIGHTERS. I'M JUST THANKFUL, FOR ONE, THAT MY CHILDREN AND I MADE IT SAFELY OUT OF THE CAR, AND FOR ANOTHER, THAT I DID NOT MAKE IT THE MILE AND A HALF LEFT TO HOME AND GET PARKED IN MY CARPORT BEFORE MY CAR CAUGHT FIRE.

I CALLED DODGE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WORKED WITH SOMEONE TO GET APPROVAL FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO GET PAID.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET THIS APPROVED DUE TO MULTIPLE REASONS (MANAGERS ON VACATION/SYSTEM NOT SETUP TO DO SO).

ON MARCH 2014 WE TOOK ANOTHER TRIP, TWO HOURS INTO OUR TRIP IT OVERHEATED AGAIN, WE LET IT COOL DOWN AND DROVE IT TO THE NEAREST SERVICE STATION. THE CAR WAS SERVICED FOR TWO DAYS, DODGE DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF OVERHEATING WAS DUE TO THERMOSTAT AND SENSOR MALFUNCTION. A WEEK  LATER- MARCH 22, WE TOOK IT BACK FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. DODGE DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF OVERHEATING WAS DUE TO AIR PRESSURE IN THE ENGINE. FOUR WEEKS LATER, APRIL 21, WE TOOK IT YET AGAIN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, WHICH BRINGS ME TO TODAY. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONSTANT PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY, TIME AND MONEY (HOTELS, RENTALS, ECT). THIS ISSUE HAS RUINED MY VACATION, HAS CAUSED ME TO MISS WORK AND MEET DEADLINES. WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST INCIDENT, I DECIDED TO CALL IT A FLUKE. I SAID, THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE,  I DECIDED TO FORGET IT AND MOVE ON. WHEN IT RUINED MY VACATION YET A SECOND TIME AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUED AFTER MULTIPLE SERVICES, WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS CAR WAS UNSAFE AND UNRELIABLE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.
