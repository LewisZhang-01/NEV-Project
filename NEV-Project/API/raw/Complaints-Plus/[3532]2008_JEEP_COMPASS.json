We took it to our local Auto serviceman who checked the car out, and made us aware of the Warranty Extension b/c the Font Crossmembers are rusted out. We live in Ohio and would qualify for the Warranty, yet the car is past the 10 year timeframe. Other than this issue, the car is in great shape, only 85K miles. I contacted the dealership and Chrysler about the issue, and both said they would not honor the warranty. My questions are, is there anything else I can do, and if this is done as an extended warranty, are all customers formally notified? Why would the dealership not ever recommend the fix if they serviced the car, which according to this family member, never happened?  There has been no accident, but the car rattles a little when driven, so I want to fix it before something does happen.",

IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO HAVE PEOPLE DRIVING ON THE ROAD WHOSE ENGINES CAN SHUT OFF AT ANY MOMENT CAUSING THEM TO COME TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.  THE PROBLEM IS THE VAPOR/LIQUID SEPARATOR VALVE LOCATED AT THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. THE VALVE IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT LIQUID FUEL FROM ENTERING THE CHARCOAL CANISTER/EMISSIONS SYSTEM. WHEN THE VALVE FAILS, LIQUID GAS CAN ENTER THE LINE AND FILL THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. AFTER REFUELING THE PCM ON THE VEHICLE DETECTS A CHANGE IN FUEL LEVEL. THEN, WHEN THE ENGINE MEETS CERTAIN TEMPERATURE AND DRIVING CRITERIA, THE PCM ISSUES A PURGE COMMAND TO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER TO REMOVE THE STORED GAS VAPORS. IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT ALL THE LIQUID GAS IN THE LINE GETS SUCKED INTO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. THE PCM EXPECTS TO SEE GAS VAPORS ENTERING THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND IT IS PREPARED TO ADJUST AIR/FUEL MIXTURES TO COMPENSATE. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PREPARED TO SEE LIQUID GAS COMING INTO THE INTAKE. THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY FIX IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE GAS TANK.",
