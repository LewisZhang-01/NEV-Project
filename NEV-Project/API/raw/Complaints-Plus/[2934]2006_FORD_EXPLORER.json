ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO THE ETB; CODES AND MECHANIC EXPERIENCE SUGGEST REPLACING ETB, ONLY TO HAVE SAVE ISSUE ARISE AGAIN IN TWO TO THREE MONTHS, IF NOT WEEKS, OR EVEN DAYS, AFTER REPLACEMENT.

A RESTART OF VEHICLE, THE \"WRENCH\" ICON TURNS OFF, AND VEHICLE WILL DRIVE, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO PERFORM POORLY. THE ABOVE OCCURS IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER, AND TIMES OF DAY, OR YEAR, WITHOUT WARNING, NO MATTER THE DIVING CONDITIONS. THE PROBLEMS ARE INCONSISTENT AND IRREGULAR. THE SYMPTOMS MAY OCCUR ON FIRST START IN DRIVEWAY, ON BUSY STREET, OR IDLING IN SCHOOL PICK-UP LINE. WHEN THE ETB IS REPLACED, THE VEHICLE DRIVES AS MANUFACTURE INTENDED, DEMONSTRATING THE ISSUE IS WITH THE ETB, AS NUMEROUS MECHANICS HAVE DIAGNOSED, FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO MANY NAME-BRAND AND LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOPS. THE REPLACED-ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODIES PERFORM WELL FOR INCONSISTENT TIME PERIODS NO MATTER OF THE MANUFACTURER. OEM ETB DO NOT SEEM TO LAST ANY LONGER THAN AFTER-MARKET ETB'S.",

THESE PLUGS ARE KNOWN TO BLOW OUT OF THE HEAD AND I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY ACCIDENTS. I AM A DISABLED VETERAN 83 YEARS OLD  AND A MECHANICAL ENGINEER.

THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND A RESOLUTION. I TRIED TO TRADE THE CAR IN AND WAS TOLD NO. I CRIED AND EXPLAINED MY SAFETY CONCERNS FOR MY CHILDREN BUT THEY DO NOT CARE. FINALLY THE CAR WAS NOT ANY BETTER BUT STARTED TO STALL MORE OFTEN AND EVEN BEGAN TO LURCH FORWARD ALMOST CAUSING ME NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS. THE LAST TIME IT STALLED WAS ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS WHICH WAS SO DEVASTATING TO ME AND MY CHILDREN. I BROUGHT THE CAR IN AND WAS TOLD AFTER AN 1 HOUR AND A HALF THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I REFUSED TO LEAVE AND SUGGESTED THEY KEEP LOOKING BECAUSE THE CAR IS NOT SAFE. THE CAME BACK AFTER ANOTHER HOUR AND TOLD ME THAT THEY CALLED FORD AND THEY SUGGESTED A PART TO REPLACE BUT COULDN'T GUARANTEE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SURE THAT WOULD WORK. I SAID NOT TO KEEP LOOKING. AFTER 3 HOURS AT THE DEALER THEY HAD TO BRING ME HOME AND DRIVE MY CAR AROUND WITH A COMPUTER ATTACHED.

I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL CAR MECHANIC AND HE SAID HE CALLED THE FORD DEALERSHIP PARTS DEPARTMENT AND THEY WANTED $800 FOR A NEW RADIATOR.  MY MECHANIC FIXED THE TRUCK BUT HIS PARTS CONTACT SAID THE RADIATOR IS ON A NATIONWIDE BACK ORDER BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE DEFECTIVE RADIATORS IN 2006-2007 FORD EXPLORER TYPE VEHICLES.   I CALLED THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY REPAIR ABOUT 4 OR 5 A YEAR AND IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY OR RECALL.  AFTER THE REPAIR I FOUND OUT THERE IS A TSB RECOMMENDATION FROM THE MANUFACTURE IN ORDER TO GET A LIFETIME WARRANTY.  THE FORD DEALERSHIP CAN ONLY DO THIS AND FOR $95 THE TSB WILL CORRECT THE TEMPERATURE COMPUTER SETTINGS SO THE COOLING FAN WILL TURN ON SOONER.  THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES MAY BE THE REASON THIS RADIATOR IS FAILING BECAUSE THEY SHOULD LAST 10 PLUS YEARS OF THE LIFE OF A VEHICLE BEFORE NEEDING REPLACEMENT.  THE GASKET SEAL BETWEEN PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM ON THE UPPER DRIVER SIDE IS THE CAUSING THE PROBLEM, SO IT'S OBVIOUS THERE IS A COMBINATION OF IMPROPER TEMPERATURE SETTINGS AND DEFECTIVE PART.  THIS PART SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR A DEFECTIVE ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE DIRECT OR INDIRECT DEATHS AND/OR INJURIES.  IT COST ME $530 INSTALLED AT A LOCAL RADIATOR REPAIR SHOP.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 71,000.  *TR",

FIRST OF ALL, LET ME JUST SAY THAT ON CARCOMPLAINTS.COM THERE ARE 47 COMPLAINTS ABOUT RADIATOR LEAKS AND HAVING TO REPLACE RADIATORS. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF IT OVERHEATS...IT COULD LEAVE SOMEONE STRANDED ON SIDE THE HIGHWAY, OR EVEN EXPLODE OR CATCH ON FIRE! PLEASE LOOK AT CARCOMLAINTS.COM AND REVIEW THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT FORD 2006 EXPLORER RADIATORS! MANY PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THIS SAME RADIATOR REPLACED MORE THAN ONCE! OK, NOW TO ME...I BOUGHT A 2006 FORD EXPLORER IN JANUARY OF 2006. IN MARCH OF 2008, I WAS TOLD THAT MY RADIATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY A VEHICLE WITH 40,000 MILES ON IT, WHICH GET SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE CHECKS REGULARLY WITH A MECHANIC COULD HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM. WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY...I GOT IT REPAIRED OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE MY 36,000 MILE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED. IT WAS VERY COSTLY. WELL,I CONTINUED TO GET MY VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AS SCHEDULED. WELL, JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR LESS THAN 23 MONTHS(LESS THAN 2 YEARS) LATER, I EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEM. ANOTHER RADIATOR LEAK! I HARDLY EVEN GO ANY WHERE! THE NEW RADIATOR WAS YET AGAIN ANOTHER FORD RADIATOR! I COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT ON SIDE THE ROAD OR HAD SOME SORT OF EXPLOSION! I BELIEVE THERE ARE DEFECTS IN THESE RADIATORS AND I BELIEVE THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS ISSUING OUT FAULTY EQUIPMENT. I BELIEVE THAT WE, THE CONSUMER, OR SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES DUE TO THEIR NEED TO STAY AFLOAT. AFTERALL, THEY TOO NEEDED A BAILOUT AND WHAT AGREAT WAY TO SAVE MONEY IF RADIATORS OR BUILTTO LAST ONLY A SHORT TIME,AND PEOPLE GO TO KEEP PAYING FOR NEW ONES! PLEASE CHECK ON THIS. I BELIEVE A RECALL IS NEEDED!!!!!!!!   P.S.   WHILE WRITING THIS LETTER, JUST RECEIVED A PHONE CALL THAT A TECHNICAL ALERT HAS BEEN PUT OUT ON 2006 FORD EXPLORER RADIATORS, AND BECAUSE OF THE COMPLAINT ...THE MODEL IS NOT BEING MADE ANYMORE!

I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE WITH APPROXIMATELY 30K MILES ON IT AND WITHIN ABOUT 2,000 MILES OF THE PURCHASE I STARTED NOTICING SHIFTING PROBLEMS. FOR SOME REASON THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO SHIFT FINE, BUT HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN. MOST VEHICLES SHIFT 1ST, 2ND, 3RD, SO ON PER THE SPEED AND SHIFTS TO ASSIST GAS MILEAGE AS WELL. WELL, MY EXPLORER WILL SHIFT INTO WHAT I BELIEVE IS 5TH GEAR AT 30 MILES PER HOUR AND ITS SOUNDS LIKE ITS BOGGING DOWN AND THERE IS ALMOST NO ACCELERATION AT ALL! AS WELL IT WILL SHIFT INTO 5TH WHEN CLIMBING A STEEP HILL AND WHEN IT FINALLY DOES DOWNSHIFT IT MAKES A \"CLUNK\" NOISE AND DROPS INTO 2ND GEAR CAUSING THE ENGINE TO REV WAY UP AND IT SUDDENLY FEELS LIKE YOUR TAKING OFF IN AN AIRPLANE. IF YOU LET OFF THE GAS TO SLOW DOWN IT DROPS RIGHT BACK INTO 5TH GEAR AGAIN AND THEN THE STORY REPEATS ITSELF. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES NOW AND THE ONLY CHANGES MADE WERE A TCM UPDATE AND ADAPTIVE LEARNING STRATEGY MEMORY CLEARING AND NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS FIXED THE ISSUE AT ALL. I NOTICE AS DAYS GO ON THAT THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE AND I NEVER GET A GOOD ANSWER. UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE  HAVE HAD THE SAME TRANSMISSION RELATED ISSUES FROM LUNGING, TO CLUNKING, TO SEVERE SHIFTING DELAYS. I'M WORRIED THAT MY TRANSMISSION OR DRIVETRAIN WILL EXPERIENCE SOME KIND OF CRITICAL FAILURE AND FORD WONT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY. I CONTACTED FORD DIRECTLY AND THE ONLY ANSWER I GOT FROM A CSR WAS, \"UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NO COMMENT TO ASSIST YOU AT THIS TIME.\" I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE FOR A POSSIBLE TRANSMISSION OR DRIVETRAIN RECALL. *TR",

SOMETIMES IT OCCURS SO STRONGLY THAT THE ENTIRE CAR NOTICEABLY AND VIOLENTLY SHUDDERS OR LURCHES, AND THE CAR JUMPS FORWARD AS IT STOPS.  I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW CLOSE I AM TO THE INTERSECTION OR TO THE BUMPER OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME IN CASE IT DOES THIS, POTENTIALLY CAUSING A HAZARDOUS SITUATION OR ACCIDENT.   THE CAR HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A SIMILAR SHIFTING INCONSISTENCY UPON ACCELERATION FROM A STANDSTILL AS IT SHIFTS (PRESUMABLY) INTO SECOND GEAR.  SOMETIMES IT IS SUCH A SEVERE JOLT THAT MY HEAD SNAPS BACK AND HITS THE HEADREST OF THE SEAT.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY ON FOUR OCCASIONS TO CORRECT THIS DEFECTIVE BEHAVIOR.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR THE TRANSMISSION WITH TWO SEPARATE  FIXES WHICH HAVE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO AFFECT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR WITH SUCH FREQUENCY THAT I FEEL UNSAFE IN THE VEHICLE, AND I DON'T FEEL SECURE WHEN DRIVING IT DUE TO THE INCONSISTENT AND ERRATIC BEHAVIOR OF THE TRANSMISSION.  I THINK THAT THE VEHICLE IS MECHANICALLY UNSOUND, AS A RESULT AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS LIKELY TO FAIL ALTOGETHER AT SOME POINT, OR POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION.  *TR",

MY FAMILIES SAFETY WAS PUT AT RISK AND NOBODY AT FORD THAT WE TALKED TO SEEMED TO CARE AND I THINK THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED A LITTLE FURTHER, WHICH IS WHY I AM WRITING THIS AND LETTING YOU ALL KNOW.  *JB",

ON DECEMBER 9, 2005 WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH MY TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE TRUCK I PULLED OUT OF A PARALLEL PARKING SPACE AND THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN TO FEEL VERY TIGHT AND IT WAS GRINDING WHEN STEERING SLIGHTLY LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE CENTER AND THEN IT WOULD FREE UP AGAIN MAKING THE TRUCK EASY TO OVERSTEER.  AS I DROVE THE TIGHTNESS WOULD GO AWAY UNTIL I SLOWED DOWN AND THEN IT WOULD GET TIGHT AGAIN.  ALSO THE GRINDING ON TURNS EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT REMAINED.  I GOT TO A SAFE PLACE AND CALLED MY PURCHASING DEALER BURNS FORD 359 WEST JERICHO TPKE, HUNTINGTON, NY  11743.  THEY ADVISED ME NOT TO DRIVE THE TRUCK AND CALL FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  I DID AND THEY TOWED THE TRUCK TO BURNS FORD.  THEY CALLED ME LATER IN THE DAY TO TELL ME THAT FORD ADVISED THEM THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRUCK AND PARTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE 1ST QUARTER OF 2006.  THE FOLLOWING IS THE NOTICE:  18962  2006 EXPLORER 4DR /MERCURY MOUNTAINEER-INTERMEDIATE (1) SHAFT POP/CLUNK NOISE.  SOME 2006 EXPLORER 4DR AND MOUNTAINEER VEHICLES MAY EXHIBIT A CREAK/POP HEARD AND FELT THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL, USUALLY NOTICED AT STATIONARY OF LOW-SPEED TURNS WHILE ACCELERATING AND BRAKING.  IF DIAGNOSIS FINDS THAT THIS MAY BE DUE TO INTERMEDIATE SHAFT HAVING STICK-SLIP CONDITION, DO NOT REPLACE THE 1 SHAFT AT THIS TIME. THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY ENGINEERING.  A REVISED COMPONENT IS DUE FIRST QUARTER 2006.  MONITOR OASIS FOR UPDATES.  EFFECTIVE DATE:  12/1/2005.  RIGHT NOW MY TRUCK IS STILL AT THE DEALER.  I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING IT AND I NEED TO RENT A CAR.  PLEASE ADVISE  THANK YOU,  LAURA MASIAKOS.  *NM   *AK",
