I HAD A PASSENGER IN MY CAR WHO EXPERIENCED THIS ROUGH RIDE AND MADE A COMMENT ABOUT IT.   A FEW DAYS LATER, ON MARCH 8,2020, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM LEXUS ENFORM SERVICES WITH A VEHICLE HEALTH REPORT INFORMING ME THAT MY VEHICLE REQUIRES ATTENTION DUE TO A SAFETY RECALL 20LA01.  WHEN I LEASED MY VEHICLE, I WAS NEVER INFORMED OF THIS RECALL WHICH GOES BACK TO 01/13/2020.  SAFETY IS A TOP CONCERN FOR ME AND I FULLY COMMUNICATED THIS TO THE SALESPERSON WHEN I LEASED MY CAR BUT I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THIS RECALL AT THAT TIME. I HAVE EXACTLY 2800 MILES ON MY CAR.  I AM NOT ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT LEXUS DOES NOT HAVE A REMEDY AVAILABLE TO FIX THE LOW -PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL HAVE IT.
