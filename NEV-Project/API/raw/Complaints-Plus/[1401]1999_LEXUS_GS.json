THE AUTOMOBILE JUMPED THE CURB AND STRUCK A LOW GARDEN WALL FORCING AN ENGINE STOP. THE AIRBAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY. MY ESTIMATE OF THE SPEED WHEN STRIKING THE WALL WAS 30 TO 35 MPH. I HAVE PICTURES WHICH SHOW THE BRAKE STREAKS AS WELL AS TOTAL DAMAGE SCENE. IN ADDITION A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR HEARD THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND CAN VERIFY THE EXTENT OF THE BRAKING EFFORT. TO DATE LEXUS HAS STATED THAT IT WAS NOT AN AUTOMOBILE DEFECT. I AM LOOKING INTO APPROPRIATE LEGAL ACTION. THE 1999 GS300 IS IDENTIFIED AS A CANDIDATE FOR UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATIONS IN THE RECENTLY COMPLETE TOYOTA UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION CLASS ACTION SUITE BUT MY EVENT IS CLOSED OUT DUE TO THE DATE OF OCCURRENCE.  *TR",
