While driving the vehicle i started to hear noise from the rear wheel and it continued to get worse. I had someone look into it and every tire on the vehicle had lug nuts loss to the point that you can move them with your hand. This really demonstrate lack concern to human safety and life. My family and I could been killed or seriously harmed from the carelessness of the dealer. This is not the first time this happened and one time we had 4 lug nuts not even put on vehicle. I need someone to address this ASAP.",

IN THE MORNING NOTICED CHEWED UP PIECES OF FOAM AND RUBBER AND LARGE RAT FECES ALL OVER VEHICLE INTERIOR.  MIDDLE ROW SEAT CHEWED.  POPPED THE ENGINE HOOD.  VERY SIZABLE NEST LOCATED IN ENGINE.   VEHICLE CURRENTLY IN FOR REPAIR ESTIMATED AT 1000$ PLUS DEDUCTIBLE AND RENTAL CAR FEES AS WELL.  CONTACTED DEALER AND TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE.  BASICALLY TOLD THAT TOYOTA USES SOY BASED PRODUCTS IN AN EFFORT TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO FIX THE ISSUE BUT CAN ONLY TAKE DOWN MY RECORD OF COMPLAINT.  I EMPHASIZED THAT I HAVE 2/3 OTHER VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN PARKED IN THE SAME LOCATION AND HAVE NEVER BEEN TARGETED BY RODENTS BUT THIS VEHICLE HAS ATTRACTED RODENTS TWICE IN 9 MONTHS AND THAT IT IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD SINCE THEY ARE CHEWING INTO WIRING IN MY ENGINE BECAUSE THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY ATTRACTED TO THE MANUFACTURING COMPONENTS.    I ALSO INQUIRED WHAT I AS THE CONSUMER COULD DO TO DETER THE ISSUE.   THEY COULD GIVE NO ADVICE OF COURSE.  AND TOYOTA IS AWARE BUT CONTINUES TO COMPROMISE THEIR CUSTOMER'S SAFETY IN AN EFFORT TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.",
