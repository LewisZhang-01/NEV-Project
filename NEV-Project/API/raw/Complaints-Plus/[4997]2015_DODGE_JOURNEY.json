Luckily I had plenty of room between myself and the car in front of me. It never happened again so I thought it was a fluke.  Thirty days or so later, I started the engine and everything was fine but after about 20 feet down the road, the brake, ABS, and traction lights all came on. Went back home, turned off the engine, went inside to ask husband to come look and when he turned engine back on and he tried driving it around the corner but the lights did not come back on. The issue continued with the lights going on and go off, when they are on the cruise control is inoperable. We took it to Autozone to see if we could find out what might be going on and we were told that we would need to take it to a Dodge dealership. It took several weeks for them to fit us in, but when they took in we were told it was an internal short in the ABS module and would need to be replaced. We were also told that it would be 3 months before they could even order it. While we have been waiting to safely use our vehicle I have been researching and found that there is a recall on other 2015 Dodge Journeys (R61) for issue with the ABS module for just the reason we are having to replace ours.  In checking our VIN, it states that our vehicle is not covered under the recall, but not only am I questioning that should it be and there might be many other vehicles on the road with the issue and they won't know it until it is too late since ours had a scary event prior to warning lights ever coming on. I also do not think we should have to pay over $1,000 for an issue covered under a recall.",

I went to an Auto Parts store and was informed that this part has not been released for aftermarket sale. So I called the dodge dealership and was told that I can not just buy the Tee joint. I have to buy the entire assembly with is around $200. I researched how much it would cost for part and labor if I didn't change it my self and that would cost $600. This is a Factory issuse so it should not be on the buyer's to have to change this part.

AT LEAST, WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SMOKE. APPARENTLY WHAT IT ACTUALLY WAS, WAS THE T SHAPED HOUSE THAT LEADS TO THE RADIATOR AND IS RUN RIGHT ALONG SIDE THE HEATING COIL IS MADE OF PLASTIC. THE HEATING COIL HAD MELTED A HOLE IN IT, CAUSING THE RADIATOR FLUID TO SPRAY ON EVERYTHING UNDER THE HOOD.

I AM NOT SURE IF THERE IS A RELEVANCE TO THE PROBLEM BUT A WEEK BEFORE THIS HAPPENED MY KEYFOB WOULD NOT WORK AT ALL. THE CAR WOULD SAY KEY NOT DETECTED. I HAD TO PRESS THE KEYFOB INTO THE BUTTON TO GET THE CAR STARTED. ONCE I GOT HOME, WHICH IS 15 MILES AWAY, I NOTICED THE TPM SENSORS WERE ONLY READING 1 TIRE PRESSURE. THE OTHERS WERE READING \"---\". THE KEYFOB BATTERY'S WERE REPLACED ON BOTH KEYFOBS TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS NOT THE ISSUE BUT IT DIDN'T HELP. I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY TO RESET THE COMPUTER AND THE KEYFOBS STARTED TO WORK CORRECTLY. I DROVE THE CAR A FEW MILES AND THE TPM SENSORS STARTED TO READ.

THE 2ND NOTICE WAS RECEIVED IN JAN16.  I CALLED THE DEALER ON 1/4 AND 1/21/16 AND WAS TOLD THEY DID NOT HAVE AND DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE THE PART TO MAKE THE REPAIR. THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE MY NAME AND NUMBER AND PUT ME ON THE WAITING LIST AND CALL ME WHEN THE PART WAS IN. IT IS 3/1/16 AND I HAD NOT HEARD FROM LANDMARK DODGE WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM AND HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH. I CALLED THEM TO SEE IF THEY HAD THE PART AND GUESS WHAT THEY SAID THEY JUST HAPPEN TO GET 5 IN TODAY! HOWEVER THEY COULD NOT SCHEDULE THE REPAIR UNTIL 4/1/16. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE BRAKE SYSTEM HERE. 4 MONTHS TO DO A REPAIR THAT THE MANUFACTURER KNEW WAS REQUIRED FOR SAFETY SAKE. I REALLY FEEL THE NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS. ALSO THIS IS THE 2ND RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE AND I HAVE NOT EVEN OWNED IT FOR A YEAR YET.  THE FIRST WAS THE ENGINE BEAUTY COVER WHICH WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THAT PART ON ALSO. WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DRIVE WITH A FAULTY ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM CONTROL MODULE ON THIS VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST 3 MONTHS. AND THAT WAS JUST SINCE WE WERE NOTIFIED. THIS IS UNREASONABLE AND A SAFETY ISSUE THAT REALLY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  AND I DON'T THINK THE DEALER WAS EVEN GOING TO CALL ME BACK AS THEY SAID THEY WOULD.THANK YOU.  *TR",

NOPE AGAIN IN JULY IT DID THE EXACT SAME THING WHILE MY HUSBAND AND MY KIDS WERE IN THE CAR. THE CAR RESTARTED SO I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SECOND TIME WHERE THEY KEPT MY CAR FOR 2 DAYS AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. SO I TOOK IT HOME AND THE VERY NEXT DAY IT DIED AGAIN. I NOW HAVE A OPEN REPAIR CASE WITH CHRYSLER HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PING PONG BALL. I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY FOR MYSELF AND FAMILY AS I DO NOT TRUST MY CAR. I AM TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET ME A NEW CAR BEFORE I GO TO SEE A LEMON LAW LAWYER, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO HAS POSTED CONCERNS WITH THEIR JOURNEYS AS TO WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR FIGHT WITH DODGE? I AM SO UPSET AS I BROUGHT THIS NEW VEHICLE TO AVOID REPAIR PROBLEMS AND I UNDERSTAND EVERY CAR HAS ITS ISSUES BUT I HAVE ONLY HAD MINE FOR 5 MONTHS!!",

THEY HAVE NOW HAD MY CAR FOR 5 DAYS AND CAN'T FIND ANY ERROR CODES IN THEIR COMPUTER WHEN RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS AND \"CAN'T REPRODUCE THE STALL\". THEY ARE KEEPING IT FOR A FEW MORE DAYS TO \"PUT MORE MILES ON IT TO SEE IF THEY CAN REPRODUCE IT\" AND ALSO HAVE A CALL INTO THEIR CORPORATE ENGINEERS AND ARE WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM.    I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE T.I.P.M.

HE CLAIMED THAT THIS DEFECT IS ON OLDER MODELS 'ONLY' AND WASN'T THE PROBLEM.  ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MAKING SOME UPDATES TO THE CAR'S COMPUTER SYSTEM WITHOUT KNOWING IF THIS WILL FIX IT, HE SAID IF THEY CAN'T DIAGNOSE OR REPRODUCE THE ISSUE, THEY WILL RETURN IT TO ME AND BASICALLY JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.    ONE WEBSITE THAT REPORTED THIS EXACT ISSUE ON OLDER MODEL DODGES (VARIOUS MAKES/MODELS) IS: HTTP://WWW.CHRYSLERPROBLEMS.COM/PROBLEMS/200-ENGINE-DIES-WHILE-DRIVING.SHTML . THE REPORT SHOWS MY EXACT SITUATION! ENGINE DIES WHEN DECELERATING, NO WARNING INDICATORS, ONCE KEY IS TURNED TO OFF, IT RESTARTS, DIAGNOSTICS AT THE DEALERSHIP SHOWED NO COMPUTER CODES INDICATING FAILURE.
