I thought nothing of it until my Uncle Bobby noticed my rear shock was scraping the ground. We looked underneath to investigate and found both shock mounts completely rusted off and the frame in terrible shape. The truck itself barely has any rust other than the tailgate and bed floor. Also thought I should include that the hose that connect the gas tank and where you pump the gas is rusted to where every time I pump gas, a little drips out onto the floor. I was trying to find videos on how to fix it but came across a page that says Rangers have been recalled from the years 1995 to 2000 because of Toyota starting to make frames for them.  *EDIT* Also would like to mention that the frame where the bumper attaches to on the driver side has cracked and now the bumper is sagging down .",

I WENT INTO ACTION AND GOT THE HOOD OPEN, I SAW FLAMES COMING FROM THE SWITCH AT THE END OF THE MASTER CYLINDER. I'VE NOTICED THE SWITCH BEFORE, I DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT DID, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM. I MANAGED TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AT THAT POINT. THE SWITCH WAS COMPLETELY BURNED OUT, THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR WAS BADLY CHARRED BUT DID NOT BURN THROUGH (THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS). THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS SEARCHING FOR A REPLACEMENT SWITCH (F3TA-9F924-CA) AND FOUND OUT IT WAS CALLED: SPEED CONTROL DEACTIVATION SWITCH AND HAS TO DO WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM. PLEASE NOTE THAT MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE CRUISE CONTROL. I FURTHER FOUND OUT THAT THE SWITCH IN QUESTION HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OR REPORTED TO BE THE CAUSE OF NUMEROUS VEHICLE FIRES WHILE PARKED AND NO KEY IN THE IGNITION. I CONTACTED A LOCAL FORD DEALER AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO CAMPAIGN MESSAGES IN THE OASIS REPORTING (WHATEVER THAT IS). ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE SWITCH CAUGHT FIRED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED AND THE WEB INDICATES THAT THE SWITCH APPEARS TO BE THE CAUSE OF NUMEROUS VEHICLE FIRES. I WAS LUCKY IN THAT I DECIDED TO FIND OUT WHY THE VEHICLE ALARM WENT ON, HAD I JUST TURNED IT OFF, AND GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.

IN JANUARY OF 2003, IN RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC ON A SNOWY MORNING, I APPLIED MY BRAKES AND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I DIDN'T FEEL THE BRAKES CATCH AND HOLD THE WAY THEY SHOULD. CONSEQUENTLY, IT TOOK A LONGER DISTANCE FOR ME TO STOP. BRAKES ARE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO MY SAFETY AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF ALL OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.    I TOOK MY TRUCK TO HANKS GARAGE, INC. (5928 ACKLEY ROAD, CLEVELAND, OHIO 44105, 216-883-0345).    I WAS TOLD THAT MY REAR DRUM BRAKES HAD NOT BEEN WORKING AT ALL. IN FACT, THE REAR BRAKES HAD NOT BEEN WORKING AT ALL FOR SOME TIME AS WAS EVIDENT BY THEM BEING COMPLETELY FROZEN AND RUSTED THROUGH. ALSO, THE REAR WHEEL CYLINDERS WERE NOT WORKING. MY MECHANIC SHOWED ME HOW THE SPRINGS AND SHOES WERE RUSTED AND CRUMBLED, FELLING IN TO PIECES. THAT DISCOVERY WAS UNSETTLING TO SAY THE LEAST FOR A VEHICLE THAT ONLY HAD 29,611 MILES AT THAT TIME. I AM LUCKY THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE CONCERNING REAR BRAKES ON THESE VEHICLES.  AT THAT TIME THE TRUCKS ODOMETER READ ONLY 29,611 MILES.    CLEARLY THERE IS A SAFETY DEFECT IN THIS VEHICLES REAR DRUM BRAKING SYSTEM. THAT DEFECT IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY FORD. SAFETY FOR THE DRIVER, PASSENGER AND OTHERS ON THE ROADWAYS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. FORD SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR DESIGNS AND SAFETY QUALITY.    TODAY, AGAIN, I AM HAVING A TROUBLE WITH THE REAR BRAKES. IT SEEMS TO BE TAKING ME A LONGER DISTANCE TO STOP SAFELY.

THE ENGINEERS AT FORD HAVE DECIDED THAT MISMATCHING TIRE SIZES POSES NO ADVERSE DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR CONSUMERS.  I FEEL THAT EMERGENCY HANDLING WITH A 15\" SPARE MOUNTED ON THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE WOULD BE A CHALLENGE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.  I DOUBT THAT ANY TIRE MANUFACTURERS WOULD RECOMMEND OR SUPPORT THIS PRACTICE. WHAT DID THE DEALERSHIP OR FORD MOTOR COMPANY DO WHEN I BROUGHT THIS MATTER TO THEIR ATTENTION, YOU ASK? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THE RESULTS FROM SOME INDEPENDENT TEST CONDUCTED BY A CONSUMER GROUP OR FROM ANY TESTS THAT FORD MAY HAVE PERFORMED.  COULD THIS BE ANOTHER RECALL IN THE MAKING?  I HOPE SO, AS I THINK THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, DRIVING A VEHICLE IN THIS CONFIGURATION COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS!  THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO THE 1999 MODEL YEAR.  FORD HAS DONE THIS ON THE 2000, 2001 AND IS STILL DOING IT ON THEIR 2002 RANGERS EQUIPPED WITH 16\u0014 TIRES.  APPARENTLY FORD HAS NO PROBLEM AGGRESSIVELY MARKETING AND UPGRADING THE STANDARD 15\u0014 TIRES TO OPTIONAL 16\u0014 TIRES.  THEY JUST DON\u0012T SEE ANY NEED TO UPGRADE THE SPARE.  I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH FORD\u0012S ATTITUDE, AS I SEE A REAL PROBLEM WITH DRIVING MISMATCHED TIRES EVEN TEMPORARILY, AND ESPECIALLY ON THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE. (TIRESIZE: P235/75R15)",

THE POLICE REPORT THAT WAS FILED BACKS UP THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS: WHILE TRAVELING EAST ON STANOLIND STREET AT 30 MPH, IN THE 4400 BLOCK, THE 1999 FORD RANGER'S DRIVERS SIDE FRONT WHEEL DISENGAGED FROM THE SPINDLE CAUSING IT TO PULL LEFT AND ALONG SIDE A PARKED LATE MODEL CHEVY VAN. THE RANGER HAD NO BRAKES, AND SCRAPED ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE VAN, LEAVING SCRAPE MARKS AND AXLE GREASE, AND TIRE RUBBER RESIDUE ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE VAN. THE RANGER HIT THE FENDER OF THE VAN AND SINCE DRIVER WAS TRYING TO STEER AWAY FROM THE WRECK, THIS ALLOWED THE FRONT OF THE RANGER TO PULL TO THE RIGHT BACK TOWARDS THE STREET. AT THAT POINT THE ENTIRE \"WHEEL ASSEMBLY\" CAME OFF AND TRAVELED 4 HOUSES AHEAD OF THE NOW 3-WHEELED RANGER. AFTER THE WHEEL ASSEMBLY EXITED, THE KNUCKLE HIT THE PAVEMENT AND FORCED THE RANGER INTO THE BOAT WHICH WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE VAN. THE BOAT TRAILER WHEELS WERE \"CHOCKED\" AND THE IMPACT OF THE RANGER LIFTED THE BOAT TRAILER INTO THE DRIVEWAY NEXT DOOR TO WHERE IT WAS PARKED. WHEN THE MIDLAND POLICE ARRIVED,WE ALL STARTED DISCOVERING THE PARTS LYING IN THE STREET WELL BEFORE THE CRASH SITE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE HUB CAP CAME OFF FIRST AND ROLLED TO THE GRASS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE (4' NORTH) OF THE VAN. THE AXLE DUST COVER CAME OFF NEXT AND ROLLED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET ( SOUTH), EVEN WITH THE BOAT. THE AXLE BEARING AND SEAL WERE FOUND 20' IN FRONT OF THE VAN SO THEY PROBABLY CAME OUT NEXT. THE AXLE NUT AND KEEPER WERE FOUND BESIDE THE BOAT IN THE GRASS.

THE STORE MANAGER INSPECTED MY TIRES AND ADVISED THAT HE THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS A COSMETIC FLAW THAT NORMALLY SHOWS UP ON TIRES WITH 25,000 MILES ON THEM. HE ALSO ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRES FOR FREE AS WITH THE RECALLED MODELS AND WOULD ONLY SELL ME ANOTHER SET AFTER PRO-RATING THE TIRES. WELL ON 09/03/2000, THE SO CALLED COSMETIC FLAW ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE ON MY TRUCK GAVE WAY. FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE TIRE HAD BEEN MAKING A BUMPING SOUND AND ON 09/03/2000 IT BECAME A ROAR THEN THE TIRE WENT. LUCKY FOR ME AND MY PASSENGER IT DID NOT TOTALLY BLOW OUT. THE TIRE ACTUALLY SPLIT APART LAYER BY LAYER AND MUST HAVE BEGAN LEAKING FROM THE CORE, THUS RELEASING THE PRESSURE BEFORE IT HAD TIME TO BLOW.

AS I DROVE DOWN THE SURFACED ROAD, I NOTICED A LOT OF VIBRATION IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. I PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER TO CHANGE THE TIRE, AS I WAS EXITING THE VEHICLE THERE WAS A LOAD \"POP\" AND THE TIRE WAS FLAT!  THE SERVICE PERSONNEL AT MIKE SHAD FORD LET ME SEE THE TIRE AS THEY TOOK IT FROM THE RIM.  THERE WAS A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF RUBBER POWDER, THE STEEL BELTS WERE SHREDDED AND RUSTY. IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE TIRE HAD COME APART FROM THE INSIDE OUT. MYSELF, THE TECHNITION, SERVICE ADVISOR COULD NOT BELIEVE THE TIRE HAD ONLY 6700 MILES ON IT. BUT IT WAS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT. THE DEALER TIRE MANAGER DETERMINED DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF WEAR ON THE TREAD THAT I HAD TO BUY A NEW REPLACEMENT. WHEN I COMPLAINED THAT THE TIRE HAD TO BE DEFECTIVE HE DISSAGREED. NOT DEFECTIVE, ABUSED! HE AUTHORISED A $15. ADJUSTMENT AND A FREE ALL WHEEL ALIGNMENT.  THE SECOND FAILURE WAS NEARLY A YEAR LATER BUT ON THE SAME WHEEL AND SAME SURFACED ROAD. AT 55MPH I FELT SOMETHING SLIP OR GO LOOSE IN THE REAR END, FOLLOWED BY SEVERE VIBRATION. I PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER IMMEDIATLY, STOPPED, EXITED THE VEHICLE AND LOOKED AT THE RIGHT REAR TIRE. I FOUND SIMULAR DAMAGE AS THE FIRST TIME, A LARGE BUBBLE ON THE SIDEWALL, SMALLER BUBBLES A RIDGES WERE THE SIDEWALL AND TREAD MEET, AND A LARGE BUBBLE UNDER THE TREAD. THIS TIRE DID NOT BLOW BUT THE TIRE & WHEEL ASSEMBLY WERE VERY HOT! I HAD TO LET THEM COOL ABOUT 25/30 MINUTES BEFORE I CHANGED THE TIRE. THIS TIRE IS NOW MY SPARE.  AT 19625 MILES THE ORIGINAL SET OF TIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED. WITH 14500 MILES ON THIS REPLACEMENT SET FORD NOTES ALL 5 TIRES REQUIRE REPLACEMENT DUE TO EXCESSIVE WEAR.

BRIEF SUMMARY:     A FIRESTONE WILDERNESS HT TIRE BLEW OUT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO ON MY FORD RANGER. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ON A TEXAS STATE HIGHWAY AT THE TIME THE BLOW OUT OCCURRED. THE BLOW OUT WAS CENTERED ON THE ENTIRE OUTSIDE OF THE DRIVERS REAR TIRE.  THE REMNANTS OF THE TIRE WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE THUS MAKING IT HARD FOR MY WIFE TO BRING THE TRUCK TO A STOP IN A CONTROLLED FASHION.  I REPORTED (7:45AM CST; 7/20/00; 1-800-392-3673; AN INDIVIDUAL NAMED DAVID) THE INCIDENT TO FORD  MOTOR COMPANY. HE WAS APPRAISED OF THE INCIDENT AND INFORMED ME THERE WAS NO RECALL. HE GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING NUMBER TO CALL FIRESTONE (1-800-847-3272).  I CALLED BETWEEN 8-10AM ON 7/20/00. I SPOKE WITH A RUDE AND COMBATIVE PERSON NAMED \"ROCK\". HE SAID IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS THAT THE TIRES CAUSED ANY PROBLEM. HE SAID THAT MY WIFE WAS AWED BY THE STATE TROOPER THAT STOPPED TO HELP HER. [ THE STATE TROOPER INFORMED HER OF SEVERAL DEATHS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN TEXAS (PERHAPS BELL COUNTY) INVOLVING BLOW OUTS OF FIRESTONE WILDERNESS TIRES. HE SUGGESTED WE CHECK INTO THE MATTER.] ROCK TOLD ME HE WANTED THE TROOPERS NAME AND WANTED TO GET THE FIRESTONE LEGAL TEAM INVOLVED. IT INSULTS ME THAT HE WOULD MAKE DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT MY WIFE COMPETENCIES. HE NEVER INQUIRED ABOUT ANYONE'S HEALTH NOR TOOK DOWN ANY SPECIFICS (OR VAGARIES) OF THE BLOW OUT.

I HAVE ASKED THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE ,  THEY SAID I AM SORRY WE ALREADY GOT YOUR CHECK FROM THE BANK, AND WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THIS TRUCK.  LARRY KRAMER WOULD NOT GIVE ME ANY STRAIGHT ANSWERS.  HE WAS READY TO FIGHT,  I DO'NT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS TRUCK .  I AM CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY!  *AK",
