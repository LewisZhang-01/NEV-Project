SALES MANAGER SAID IT WAS NORMAL, THEY ALL DO THAT.  TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE, TECH TEST DROVE IT AND SAID IT WAS NOT NORMAL & SEEMED TO BE PROBLEM IN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL.  WHEN BROUGHT IN FOR REPAIRS THEY ONLY UPDATED COMPUTER SYSTEM.  PROBLEM PERSISTED WITH LOUD CLUNK AND HARD SHIFTING AT ABOUT 1500 RPM AND SLOWING AND ENGAGING GAS AT LOWER SPEEDS, TYPICALLY BETWEEN 30-40 MPH.  TOOK BACK IN, AFTER SOME TIME INVESTIGATING AND COMING UP WITH NO DIAGNOSIS THEY CONTACTED MANUFACTURERS \"STAR CENTER\" AND WERE ADVISED IT WAS A SHIFT BINDING PROBLEM IN THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL.  THEY REPLACED THE VALVE BODY & RESET THE TRANSMISSION SHIFT ADAPTIVE.  PROBLEM STILL PERSIST WHILE THE DEALERSHIP & MANUFACTURER INSISTS IT MEETS MANUFACTURER SPECS.  CONCERN IS WITH THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL BINDING AND LOCKING UP CAN & MAY LOCK THE REAR END UP BRINGING THE CAR TO AN IMMEDIATE & ILL TIMED STOP IN TRAFFIC.",
