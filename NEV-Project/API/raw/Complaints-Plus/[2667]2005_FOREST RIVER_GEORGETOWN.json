I WAS UNAWARE OF A RECALL UNTIL AFTER THE FIRE.  I RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL RECALL NOTICE FROM DOMETIC 9 DAYS AFTER THE FIRE HAD HAPPENED.    THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHALL'S OFFICE AND A FIRE INSPECTOR SPECIALIST HEARD B Y MY INSURANCE COMPANY BOTH CONCLUDED THE REFRIGERATOR STARTED THE FIRE.  ONCE I NEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR, I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE CRACK IN THE BOILER TUBE MENTIONED IN THE RECALL NOTICE AND TOOK SOME PICTURES ON THE UNIT.    MY UNIT WAS NOT OPERATING ON PROPANE BUT WAS PLUGGED INTO SHORE POWER TO KEEP THE COACH BATTERIES CHANGED AND THE REFRIGERATOR ON AS I HAD A FEW TIMES I WAS KEEPING IN THE REFRIGERATOR.    ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7TH, MY UNIT WAS DESTROYED BY A FIRE.  I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE PAINS OF TRYING TO GET THE UNIT PAID FOR AND PERSONAL PROPERTY PAID FOR BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  I AM NOW WAITING ON THE BANK TO SEND INFO FOR MY GAP PROTECTION AS INSURANCE DID NOT FULLY PAY FOR THE UNIT.    I FEEL DOMETIC SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS AND AT A MINIMUM, REPLACE MY MOTORHOME AS IT WAS A DEFECT IN THEIR PRODUCT THAT RESULTED IN MY LOSS.  I HAVE OBTAINED AN ATTORNEY AS OF THIS PAST FRIDAY TO SEE WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE AT THIS POINT.  THE RECALL INITIATED BY DOMETIC DOES NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE DEFECT BUT RATHER JUST INSTALLS A COUPLE OF SAFETY ITEMS IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF A FIRE.  THE REFRIGERATOR COULD STILL FAIL FROM THE ACTUAL DEFECT.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW THAT DOMETIC NEEDS TO ADDRESS. *TR",
