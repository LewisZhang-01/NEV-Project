THE CLIP HOLDING THE AXLE NUT CAME OFF WHILE DRIVING (AXLE NUT WAS NOT VISIBLE BEHIND THE AXLE CAP). THE WHEEL, DRUM, AND HUB ASSEMBLY WAS MISSING WHEN STOPPING FOR A BREAK. THE TRAILER IS OUTFITTED WITH DEXTER TORSION AXLES AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ALL OF THE 3 REMAINING WHEEL'S AXLE NUTS WERE NOT TORQUED. I READ THE MANUAL AND TORQUED THE NUTS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING THE HUBS. I DID NOT NOTICE THE WHEEL COME OFF WHILE DRIVING HOWEVER, AS IT CAME OFF ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE IT COULD HAVE STRUCK AN ON COMING VEHICLE.*DT*JB",
