Not being able to steer was very concerned and happened to me while driving on a busy highway at one point. I could barely steer the car well enough to get it to the shoulder. I had to cross 4 lanes of traffic during rush hour.   Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? I had it towed to the dealer the final time it happened.

Crossroads Hyundai of Loveland inspected the vehicle  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No, not until the moment the issue occurred.  The strangest part of the issue is that after I would pull over and stop the vehicle, I would clean the sensors on outside of the car and on then restart the car and then sometimes it would work again. It seemed to happen on days that there was poor weather or messy roads that would impede the sensors' abilities.",

On October 15th I was driving down a 2 lane road and heard a pop, I didn't think much of it, thought it might have been an acorn that fell on my roof as the area I live in is very treesy. Later that evening when we got back in the car to leave, we noticed the windshield was cracked, probably about a six inch area. I told my husband earlier that day I heard the popping noise but did not see anything actually fly up and hit the windshield. So we proceeded to call the insurance company who told us the entire windshield would need to be replaced. We were responsible for our $500 deductible. The repair shop contacted every Hyundai dealership in the southeast region only to find out the windshields were on backorder until Oct. 31st. (red flag) In the meantime the crack has spread all the way across the windshield. We found it odd that windshields would be on backorder so we googled \"Hyundai Sante Fe cracked windshields\" and we were floored at the amount of stories out there with the same exact problem, not only with the Sante Fe but other Hyundai SUV models as well. I just wanted to bring this to your attention because I feel the windshields are defective and unsafe. I don't know how many people this has to happen to before Hyundai acknowledges the issue. Even if it were an acorn that fell, it should not have done the  damage that it did. I still feel it was spontaneous as I did not see anything actually hit or bounce off the windshield. So here we are still waiting on the windshield to arrive at the repair shop and out $500.",
