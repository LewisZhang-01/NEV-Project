        "summary": "I had my vehicle serviced for an oil change & inspection. But I also spoke with a dealership service rep regarding what I initially thought was some sort of electrical issue that has been intermittent almost since I purchased the vehicle from this dealership. Which is my radio going in and out and automatically changing the stations completely on it's on. The rep was very helpful in that she was familiar with the issue and informed me that it's a known issue at this point and the radio needs to be replaced. She informed me that the radio would have to be ordered and that if I had the extended warranty (which I did get on this car from your dealership) then my deductible would be either $100 or $200 that I would have to pay.  She looked up my info and confirmed it would be the $100 that I would have to pay. However, when she went to actually submit for the replacement radio, the system did not allow her to and showed that for some reason my radio is not able to be replaced. The representative did tell me that should would have someone follow up regarding this. However there was never a followup until I called back into the dealership service center a few days later. And was told that the radio replacement is not covered & I would have to pay out of pocket. Was not given any explanation as to WHY.  I definitely should not have to pay out of pocket (other than my deductible) to get something repaired that Dodge & Chrysler are well of is a known manufacturer issue at this point. And at this point I think a recall needs to be started regarding this issue.",

HOWEVER,  IN RESEARCHING THE INTERNET IT APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP LABELED THE PROBLEM AS A WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE AND FOR THAT REASON IT WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX IT. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A POOR DESIGNED PROBLEM THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE. I'VE OWNED MANY CARS IN MY 58 YEAR'S OF LIFE AND I KNOW THAT A BREAK ISSUE UNFORTUNATELY TAKES LOSS OF LIFE BEFORE IT'S ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHORITIES AND OR MANUFACTURER'S. I'M HOPING THAT THESE ISSUE IS ADDRESSED AS I'VE FOUND THROUGHOUT MY RESEARCH THAT IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AND IT COMES WITH OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE BRAKE FAILURE ALSO.

THE FACTORY BRAKE PAD ONLY CONTACTS A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THE ROTOR. THIS IS ON BOTH REAR WHEELS, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SURFACE. THIS EASILY REDUCES BRAKING FORCE BY HALF; MUCH MORE WHEN THE CAR IS FULLY LOADED. THE PADS DO NOT LOOK DAMAGED, JUST AN OBVIOUS DEFECT (SEE PICTURES COMPARED TO REPLACEMENT PAD). OTHER DODGE SCAT PACKS REPORT SIMILAR DEFECTS. I CONTACTED BREMBO BACK IN DECEMBER, AND AFTER MULTIPLE CONTACTS, NOTHING TO THIS DAY (EVEN THOUGH INITIALLY THEY SAID THEY'D CONTACT ME BACK IN A FEW DAYS SINCE THIS LOOKED UNUSUAL). I CONTACTED FCA, AND THEY HAD NO CLUE ABOUT THIS, SO I VISITED MY LOCAL PALMEN DODGE, RACINE, WI. THE PARTS MANAGER SAID HE'D NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE EITHER. WHEN WE LOOKED UP REPLACEMENT PADS, THEY WERE \"NORMAL\" LOOKING, LIKE THE ONE NEXT TO THE STOCK PAD THAT CAME WITH THE CAR. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS WEARING A WIDE GROOVE IN THE ROTOR, WHICH WILL THEN HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER CONFIRMED THAT I'D HAVE TO BUY IT MYSELF SINCE WEAR ITEMS ARE NOT COVERED. I HAVE CHANGED THIS PAD TYPE MANY TIMES, SINCE 2009, AND HAVE NEVER SEEN A PAD CUT BACK LIKE THIS. I AM WORRIED THAT IF I HAVE TO STOP QUICKLY, I WILL NOT GET FULL BRAKING IN THE REAR SINCE THE PADS ARE ONLY COVERING PART OF IT. SECONDLY, I WILL HAVE TO BUY TWO NEW REAR ROTORS, AND PADS, TO GET THE FULL STOPPING POWER THAT THE MANUFACTURER INTENDED.  *LN*JB",
