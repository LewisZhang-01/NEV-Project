ENGINE STALLING WHILE IN MOTION, SLUGGISHNESS, EITHER REVVED UP SO HIGH YOU THINK ITS GONNA BLOW TO NOT IDLING AT ALL AND CUTTING OFF.  MY LEFT TURN SIGNAL CHASSIS EVEN FLEW OFF WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE PLEASE LETS TAKE ACTION. WE DO NOT NEED A DEATH TO MAKE KIA HEAR US. WE COULD ALL SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER TO MR. PETER BUTTERFIELD, KIA MOTORS AMERICA, 9801 MUIRLANDS BLVD, IRVINE CA 92618.  WE COULD REFERENCE IN RESPONSE TO HIS INTERVIEW TO AUTOMOTIVENEWS.COM ABOUT KIA WANTS TO GROW UP. IT IS WRITTEN IN THIS ARTICLE HOW HE WANTS KIA TO BE KNOWN FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT WE CAN'T DRIVE OUR KIA'S FOR FEAR OF OUR LIVES AND NO ONE AT KIA IS RESPONDING TO OUR COMPLAINTS. HERE IS A SAMPLING OF REFERENCED ARTICLE: PETER BUTTERFIELD WANTS KIA MOTORS AMERICA INC. TO ACHIEVE TOYOTA-LEVEL QUALITY SCORES IN FIVE YEARS. HE ALSO WANTS TO EVOLVE FROM BEING A USED-VEHICLE ALTERNATIVE TO A PURCHASE LINKED IN THE CONSUMERS' MIND TO VALUE, SAFETY AND QUALITY.   (END OF SAMPLE) IF HE REALLY WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN, HE WILL TAKE OUR PROBLEMS SERIOUSLY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.  LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE! THANK YOU.  *AK",

A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND I WAS AGAIN ADVISED THE DEALER THAT IT WILL GO OFF BY ITSELF, THIS TIME I DIDN'T TAKE THEIR WORD AND INSISTED THAT THE VEHICLE BE CHECKED OUT. THE DEALER THEN FOUND THAT A SENSOR WAS OUT. THE REPLACED THE SENSOR AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT. A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND I ALSO RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR A CATALYTIC CONVERTER CONCERN. SO I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR BOTH PROBLEMS AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS RELATED TO THE RECALL AND BOTH WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY WEREN'T. THE SAME DAY I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE FROM THE DEALER, WHILE DRIVING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I IMMEDIATELY MADE A U-TURN WENT BACK INTO THE SERVICE DRIVE. I WAS ADVISED THAT THE SENSOR WAS OUT AGAIN AND THE PART AS NOT IN. I WAITED FOR ABOUT 4 WEEKS UNTIL THE PART CAME IN ALL WHILE DRIVING WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON. THE DEALER REPLACED THE SENSOR AGAIN AND OF COURSE, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. AT THIS TIME, I WAS ABOUT TO GO INSANE ABOUT THIS NAGGING PROBLEM THAT EITHER THE DEALER COULD NOT FIX OR THE VEHICLE COULD NOT BE FIXED. I DID NOT TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER FOR BECAUSE I HAD JUST STARTED A NEW JOB AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER OR INCUR ANYMORE RENTAL COSTS.

ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, I RECEIVED A DISTURBING CALL FROM A REPRESENTATIVE FROM KIA CONSUMER AFFAIRS TELLING ME TO IMMEDIATELY STOP DRIVING THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE SAME 3 RECALLS I SAW ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND CALLED TO INQUIRE ABOUT INCLUDED MY VEHICLE. THE RECALLS WERE: BRAKE LINE RECALL-THE STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT COUPLING CAN CONTACT A HYDRAULIC BRAKE PIPE CAUSING FLUID LEAKAGE. THIS CONDITION CAN CAUSE A LOSS OF REAR BRAKE INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.  ELECTRICAL WIRING- THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE C123 AND C124 CONNECTORS CAN BE PUT UNDER TENSION BY MOVEMENT OF THE ENGINE, THUS PULLING THE WIRES AND CONNECTORS, LOOSENING THEM AND RESULTING IN A LOSS OF CIRCUIT CONTINUITY.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER 2 DAYS LATER AND FOUND THAT THE TECHNICIAN OR \"SOMEONE\" DISCONNECTED MY INSTRUMENT PANEL IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE ENGINE LIGHT FROM COMING ON AND ME COMING BACK TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR ANOTHER 2 DAYS AND SO-CALLED FIXED THE PROBLEM. AS YOU KNOW BY NOW, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. BY THIS TIME, I HAD FILED WITH BBB AND BEGGED KIA TO TAKE THIS PROBLEM BACK. AT AN ARBITRATION HEARING, THE KIA REPRESENTATIVE DOWNPLAYED ALL OF MY RETURN TRIPS TO THE DEALER BY STATING THAT THE DEALER DID NOT REPORT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS TO THEM AND THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. ALL OF THAT WAS A LIE SINCE KIA WAS NOTIFIED BY CERTIFIED LETTER OF THE PROBLEMS AND RETURN TRIPS. WELL, THE ARBITRATOR SIDED WITH KIA AND STATED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE PRESUMABLY MET THE CRITERIA FOR LEMON LAW, SHE FELT THAT THE DEALER SHOULD GET ONE MORE CHANCE TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. SINCE I DID NOT LIKE THE ARBITRATOR\u0012S DECISION, I UTILIZED ONE OF THE OTHER OPTIONS SHE OFFERED AND ACTED AS IF THE HEARING NEVER HAPPENED. I DROVE WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT COMING ON AND OFF FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS UNTIL THINGS GOT WORSE. THE REAR END STARTED JINGLING LOUDER THAN EVER, THE FRONT END WAS GRINDING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, THE VEHICLE WOULD JUST TAKE OFF ON IT'S OWN, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BECOME STUCK IN ONE GEAR OR ANOTHER WITHOUT SHIFTING, THE WINDOWS WERE SLOW AGAIN, AND THE VEHICLE WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF. I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY KEPT IT FOR ANOTHER 7 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AND WHEN I PICKED MY VEHICLE UP, THERE WAS A HIDEOUS DENT AND SCRATCH ON MY RIGHT FRONT FENDER AS IF A CINDER BLOCK HAD FELL ON IT. THE DEALER TRIED TO RELEASE THE VEHICLE TO ME THAT WAY BUT I REFUSED. THE KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR ANOTHER 3 DAYS WHILE THEY KNOCKED OUT THE DENT AND REPAINTED THE FENDER.

I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE NOISE WAS DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEING IN STORAGE FOR OVER A YEAR AND WHEN PURCHASED BY MYSELF THAT A NEW OIL FILTER AND OIL CHANGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS I FINALLY GOT HIM TO PUT IT IN WRITING AND I NOW HAVE THE DOCUMENT AS PROOF. MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES A LIFTER GO BAD AT 594 MILES AND WHY DIDN'T A LARGE COMPANY SUCH AS KIA HAVE THE INSIGHT TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE UPON PURCHASE OF A VEHICLE. I HAVE ACESSED YOUR COMPLAINT FILES FOR THE 1998 SPORTAGE AND IT PRINTED 21 PAGES. CAN ALL THOSE CONSUMERS BE WRONG? I DO NOT THINK SO, I FEEL MY SUV IS ON ITS WAY TO BEING THE LEMON THAT ATTACKED NEW YORK. IF I WAS ADVISED OF YOUR WEBSITE PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY LOOKED TO OTHER AUTO MAKERS.

WHEN DRIVING AND PARTICULARLY ENGAGING THE CLUTCH TO DOWN SHIFT THE GEAR LINKAGE DISENGAGES AND THE GEARS CAN'T BE LOCATED ESPECIALLY IN SECOND, THIRD OR FOURTH GEARS AND BECAUSE OF SUCH HAS ALMOST CAUSED THREE CRASHES.  WE HAD THIS CHECKED BY THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GEAR SHIFTING MECHANISM.  I BEG TO DIFFER BECAUSE I DRIVE THAT CAR EVERY DAY AND I'VE DRIVEN MANY MANUAL SHIFT TRANSMISSIONS CARS AND I BELIEVE THAT AFTER DRIVING FOR SOMETIME (I.E., ONE TO TWO HOURS) THE TRANSMISSION HEATS UP AND CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH GEAR SELECTION.",
