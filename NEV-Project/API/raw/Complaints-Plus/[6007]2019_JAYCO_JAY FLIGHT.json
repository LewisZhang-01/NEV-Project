The stove has to be taken apart to attain the Model and Serial numbers to see if they match from list given.  A picture of the information needs to be emailed along with a form to attained a remedy kit. Info has to be received from the dealer where the work is to be performed and listed on the form .Propane gas can not be used in the rv for other components, such as the refrigerator, water heater and furnace. One of the forms received was dated November 13, 2020. According to Dometic, this is when the problem arose, so we were not notified until 6 and a half months later. In the meantime, we were using our camper.  When asked what compensation will be provide to the customer and the response was \"none.\" When I stated that the customer is doing all the legwork, the response from Dometic was: No, all you have to do is bring it there. This situation has been handled very poorly. It took Dometic 6 and a half months to notify customers because they did not have the parts in stock to fix the issue. Too long !!! And now, according to Dometic, it will be a month beofre the remedy kit is sent to the dealer. Again...too long !!!",
