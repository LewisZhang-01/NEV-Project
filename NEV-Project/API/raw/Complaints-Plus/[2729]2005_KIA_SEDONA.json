        "summary": "WE HAVE A 2005 SEDONA WHICH WE LOVE. IT'S BEEN A GREAT CAR FOR US. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE HAD ONGOING ISSUES WITH IT FOR SOME TIME NOW. OUR MAIN PROBLEM AND CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS WITH THE FRONT END STRUTS AND OR ALIGNMENT.      THE NOISE AND KNOCKING AT LOW SPEEDS (ESPECIALLY WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STAND-STILL) IS TROUBLESOME, BUT MORE TROUBLESOME IS THAT WE CONSTANTLY NEED TO REPLACE THE FRONT TIRES. WE ARE GOING ON OUR 4TH SET OF NEW TIRES (FOR THE FRONT ALONE) DUE TO ALIGNMENT ISSUES. NO BALANCING OR ALIGNMENT WORK HAS HELPED.     AFTER HOURS OF RESEARCH ON LINE, IT SEEMS THAT THE FRONT BRAKES MAY BE UNDERSIZED CAUSING THE ROTORS TO OVER HEAT AND WARP. THE STRUTS ALSO SEEM TO HAVE A WRONG TYPE OF MOUNT SYSTEM AND HAVE TO BE REPLACED.     THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS TO BE FOUND ON THE WEB FROM PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR ISSUES. THERE IS A TSB ON THE TOPIC (CHA015) REGARDING NEW STRUT MOUNTS, BUT WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT NOW.

WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND THE VAN OUT OF COOLANT. I REFILLED THE COOLANT AND CHECKED FOR LEAKS, FINDING NONE I DROVE THE VAN HOME. UPON ARRIVAL AT HOME I FOUND THE VAN TO BE ALMOST OUT OF COOLANT AGAIN, BUT FOUND NO LEAKS. I REFILLED IT AGAIN AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER A SHORT TRIP I FOUND A LARGE PUDDLE OF COOLANT UNDER THE VEHICLE. I TRACED IT BACK TO TWO METAL LINES COMING OFF THE BACK OF THE MOTOR. I CALLED KIA FOR SERVICE AND WHEN THE I TOLD THEM IT WAS LEAKING COOLANT, THEIR RESPONSE TO ME WAS \"OFF THE BACK OF THE MOTOR?\". AFTER TALKING WITH HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES I WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY FOR THAT ITEM EXPIRED AT 60000 MILES AND OUR VAN HAS 65000. I SCHEDULED THE SERVICE, THEN BEGAN THINKING ABOUT HOW QUICKLY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS LEAKING FROM, AND THEN I SEARCHED ONLINE FINDING A TSB FOR THE REPAIR. THIS PROMPTED ME TO CONTACT KIA TO SEE IF THEY WOULD STILL COVER THE REPAIR AND AFTER SPEAKING WITH AN AGENT AND A COUPLE PHONE CALLS LATER I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT. THE LEAKING COOLANT COMES FROM TWO METAL COOLANT LINES THAT RUN TO THE REAR OF THE VAN FOR THE REAR HEATER. THESE LINES RUST AND CORRODE OVER A COUPLE YEAR PERIOD ALLOWING THEM TO LEAK. I WAS TOLD BY THE GENTLEMAN AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT I AM LUCKY AS MOST PEOPLE DON'T CATCH THIS IN TIME AND DO LOTS OF DAMAGE TO THE MOTOR OF THE VEHICLE. I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE IF THE VEHICLE JUST DIES IN A TRAFFIC IT CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, AND IF THE VEHICLE DIES IN INCLEMENT WEATHER INJURY OR DEATH COULD OCCUR. KIA IS OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION DUE TO THE TSB AND AT THE DEALERSHIP I WAS TOLD ONE MANUFACTURER USES ALUMINUM LINES WITH A PLASTIC COATING TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING, SO THEY ARE AWARE OF A SOLUTION. RIGHT NOW IT IS GETTING THE LINES REPLACED WITH THE SAME TYPE OF LINES THAT CORRODED, SO I WILL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. *TR",

MY KIA SEDONA HAS THE DEFECTIVE WHEEL BEARINGS AS INDICATED BY THE REPORT, BUT SOMEHOW HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL.  MY VEHICLE IS BEING SERVICED BY KIEFER KIA IN EUGENE, OREGON.    THE DEALERSHIP IS MAKING, AND PAYING FOR, NECESSARY REPAIRS.  TO MY UNDERSTANDING, HAD WE NOT FOUND THIS ISSUE BEFORE OUR WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIABLE FOR THE COST OF REPAIR.    I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS RECALL EXTENDED THROUGH MY VIN #, IF YOUR FINDINGS SUPPORT MY COMPLAINT.  MORE-SO FOR REASON TO COVER ANY OTHER PAST/FUTURE RECALLS FOUND THAT OUR VAN MAY BE AFFECTED BY.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

I INQUIRED WITH THE DEALERSHIP AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS VEHICLE HAD A FILTER FOR THE COOLING UNIT AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE OLDER KIA'S DO NOT HAVE FILTER SYSTEMS.  IT WAS FURTHER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT I WAS PROBABLY SMELLING MOLD FROM CONDENSATION THAT BUILDS UP ON THE EVAPORATOR, WHILE USING THE AC, DRAINS INTO THE RESERVOIR AND OVER TIME MOLD FORMS.  TO PREVENT THE CREATION OF MOLD THE VENT WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED TO NORMAL AIR FLOW, MANUALLY, PRIOR TO SHUTTING THE VEHICLE OFF.  TO REMOVE THE MOLD THE EVAPORATOR NEEDS TO BE CLEANED AND TREATED WITH AN ANTI-FUNGAL SPRAY.  AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE AFORE MENTIONED SERVICE IS TO DIRECTLY SPRAY THE ANTI-FUNGAL AGENT INTO THE VENTS WHILE THE HEATER IS ON HOPEFULLY, KILLING THE MOLD AND ELIMINATING THE SMELL.   I'VE CONTACTED KIA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS AGAIN INFORMED THAT THIS IS CLASSIFIED AS A \"MAINTENANCE\" ISSUE, WHICH ISN'T COVERED UNDER WARRANTY (COST ANTICIPATED $1,000).  GOOD NEWS THOUGH, ALL KIA'S FROM 2006 THROUGH PRESENT DAY HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH A CABIN FILTER; AND AN AUTO-SWITCH FOR AIR FLOW, PREVENTING MOLD.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT AND HAD A FILTER SYSTEM OF SOME KIND BEEN USED THERE WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE WITH MOLD. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER TO INFORM THE CONSUMER OF THIS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH ISSUE.  SO WHILE I'M BEING TOLD THAT THIS ISN'T A MANUFACTURE PROBLEM, BUT RATHER A \"MAINTENANCE\" ISSUE, THE VENTS CONTINUE TO BLOW THE AIR DIRECTLY TOWARD MY FACE, THUS CAUSING HEALTH RISK EXPOSURE.   I KNOW THAT PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO EXPLAIN SIGNS AND WARNINGS OF MOLD EXPOSURE AND REQUEST PREVENTATIVE MEASURES BE TAKEN SINCE THERE ARE MOLD EXCLUSIONS, SURELY MANUFACTURES SHOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME OF LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER.  *JB",

WE PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TRIED TO RESTART CAR. AFTER 5-10 MINUTES, THE CAR RESTARTED, WAS PUT IN DRIVE, AND MOVED A FEW FEET BEFORE SHUTTING DOWN AGAIN. THIS TIME IT DIDN'T RESTART AND WE TRIED TO CALL THE 800 TOW NUMBER THAT KIA GAVE US. WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH TO ANYONE, SO THE AZ HIGHWAY PATROL GOT A TOW TRUCK THERE IN 5 MINUTES.  NOT ONLY ARE WE OUT 300.00 FOR THE COST OF THE TOW, BUT IT HAS BEEN SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE 08/22/2005. THEY SAID THAT THEY WON'T GIVE US A RENTAL CAR SO WE HAD TO RENT ONE OURSELVES AT THE DEALERSHIP. I SPOKE TO THE MANAGER JOHN ON THE SATURDAY FOLLOWING AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS WAS AND THERE WAS NOBODY IN SERVICE ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WOULD CALL ME ON MONDAY MORNING(TODAY) AND HAVE SOMEONE \"ON IT\" FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. I RECEIVED NO CALL. I CALLED AROUND 5:00 PM TO FIND IT WAS JOHN'S DAY OFF AND HE WOULD BE RETURNING TUESDAY MORNING. I WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO A \"SERVICE TECH\" WHO PULLED UP ON HIS COMPUTER THE DIAGNOSTIC OF MY CAR. HE SAID THAT THEY HAD OR IS SUPPOSED TO ORDER A NEW REAR ENGINE MOUNT. HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG THE PART WOULD BE BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD TO GET IT FROM JAPAN(HQ), AND ALSO DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO INSTALL OR WHY THAT WOULD BE MAKING THE CAR SHUT DOWN. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION, AND DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING A CAR THAT NEEDS TO HAVE A PART REPLACED AFTER 4000 MILES, THAT KEEPS THE ENGINE FROM FALLING OFF THE FRAME OF MY CAR, ESPECIALLY WITH INFANTS IN MY CAR.      PLEASE ADVISE ME ON MY RIGHTS(IF ANY), AND CONTACT ME ASAP AT THE PHONE NUMBER PROVIDED. THANKS FOR ANY HELP AND CONCERN. *JB",
