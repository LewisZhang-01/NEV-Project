Both of mine (passenger and driver side) failed within the first 55,000 miles, and there are a LOT of others who have had the same problem.  The forums are littered with people reporting.  However, Toyota has discouraged people from reporting the problem to them by charging an exorbitant amount for repair of such an inexpensive item (about $800 per side).  When that becomes known to owners, people will just repair the items themselves.    This is obviously unethical.  Door lock actuators pose an obvious safety issue, both if the door remains unlocked when it is supposed to be locked, and when the door remains locked when it is supposed to be unlocked.     In the latter case, following an accident where a passenger is incapacitated and the door lock cannot be reached by hand (and there's no external key slot), the only way to unlock the door is via the electronic fob.  If the door lock actuator is broken, then that incapacitated passenger will be trapped in the vehicle.    For the former case - and this has personally happened to me - when the door was supposed to be locked, I had an individual actually open my passenger side door and enter into my vehicle. (He was under the influence of something, and fortunately nothing happened other than a very tense situation).  But the safety issue remains.  I expect that the post-accident scenario is more relevant to the NHTSA's interests, however, since a KNOWN design defect could very easily lead to the death of an individual trapped in a vehicle.",

ON-LINE FORUMS INDICATE THAT MANY OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE. ALSO THIS WEEK I HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO STEER THE VEHICLE (THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOCKING AND BINDING UP). APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS AGO THE RIGHT FRONT CALIPER FROZE UP AND THE VEHICLE NEARLY WENT OFF THE ROAD. ALSO THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL WAS NOISY FROM THE DAY THE VEHICLE WAS NEW. TOYOTA EVENTUALLY REPLACED THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL (I BELIEVE A BAD PINION GEAR). SHORTLY AFTER THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL WAS REPLACED THE VEHICLE STARTED TO GO IN AND OUT OF 4-WHEEL DRIVE ON ITS OWN, AND WARNING LIGHTS AND CHIMES STARTED GOING OFF. THE DEALER THEN MADE REPAIRS BUT THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE SINCE THEN AND THE DEALER HAS REPAIRED IT EACH TIME. ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR THE TRANSMISSION STOPPED WORKING LEAVING ME STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4-LANE ROAD. I EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO MOVE BUT THEN IT STARTED TO GO IN AND OUT OF 4-WHEEL DRIVE ON IT'S OWN AGAIN WITH WARNINGS AND CHIMES GOING OFF. WHENEVER THE VEHICLE STARTS TO GO IN AND OUT OF 4-WHEEL DRIVE ON ITS OWN THE SHIFTER LEVER USUALLY STARTS TO FREEZE UP AS WELL (AND YOU MAY NEED TO USE BOTH HANDS TO FORCE THE VEHICLE INTO GEAR). THE VEHICLE HAS ALSO HAD A STRONG ODOR OF ANTIFREEZE SINCE NEW COMING FROM THE RIGHT FRONT CORNER. THE DEALER HAS ADVISED THEY CANNOT LOCATE THE CAUSE. ALSO VARIOUS HEAT SHIELDS HAVE EITHER BROKEN OR FALLEN OFF SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NEW. PLEASE NOTE THAT I DO NOT GO 4-WHEELING WITH THE VEHICLE AND IT'S METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED INCLUDING ALL SERVICE RECORDS AND RECEIPTS.",

I DECIDED TO DRIVE IT ANYWAY TO RUN SOME ERRANDS (SHORT DISTANCE), AND NOTICED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY EITHER (NOT GOING INTO ECO MODE AND STRUGGLING TO REACH 40 MPH).  I DECIDED TO PULL OVER INTO A PARKING LOT AND CHECK UNDER THE HOOD.  THAT IS WHEN I NOTICED A SQUIRREL NESTED BY THE DRIVER'S SIDE FIREWALL.  THE SQUIRREL ALSO USED THE INSULATION FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND ALONG THE FIREWALL TO MAKE ITS NEST.  I TOOK THE 4RUNNER TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ONE OF THE ELECTRIC RUNS WAS CHEWED ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITH SOME DAMAGE ON THE MAIN HARNESS.  I LET THEM KEEP THE 4RUNNER OVER NIGHT TO GET AN ESTIMATE ON THE DAMAGE.  THE INITIAL ESTIMATE WAS FOR $5,716.30.  I DECIDED TO LET THEM KEEP THE 4RUNNER UNTIL THE WORK WAS COMPLETED.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE ELECTRIC HARNESS WOULD TAKE 3 TO 5 DAYS TO BE SHIPPED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEN I WAS NOTIFIED (6 DAYS LATER) THAT THE ELECTRIC HARNESS WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE AND WOULD TAKE ANOTHER WEEK BEFORE THEY RECEIVE IT.  I RECENTLY RECEIVED A PHONE CALL SAYING THAT ALL THE PARTS WERE IN, BUT NOW THEY WOULD EITHER HAVE TO REMOVE THE ENGINE OR RAISE THE BODY TO INSTALL THE FIREWALL INSULATION.  SO AN ADDITIONAL $2,219.66 FOR THAT PORTION OF IT.  SURE MY INSURE PICKED UP THE TAB LESS MY DEDUCTIBLE, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  I DROPPED THE 4RUNNER OFF MARCH 7, 2017 AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT SHOULD BE READY AROUND APRIL 5TH.  HOPEFULLY NOTHING ELSE IS FOUND.    I PURCHASED THE 4RUNNER BRAND NEW ON FEBRUARY 4, 2017 (DRIVEWAY KEPT).  I TRADED IN A 2006 TOYOTA TACOMA THAT I HAD FOR 11 YEARS THAT SAT OUTSIDE FOR THIS HEADACHE.  MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE TACOMA.  THE 4 RUNNER ONLY HAD APPROXIMATELY 500 MILES ON IT WHEN THIS INCONVENIENCE HAPPENED.",
