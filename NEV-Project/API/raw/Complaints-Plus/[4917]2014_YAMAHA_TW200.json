IN 2020 AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, WHEN MY SAFETY EXPIRED, I TOOK IT TO THE SAME PLACE I'VE TAKEN FOR 3 YEARS, AND HE SAID THAT IT DIDN'T PASS BECAUSE IT WAS MARKED AS AN OFF ROAD VEHICLE IN THE STATE OF HAWAII. FROM CALLING THE DMV, YAMAHA, THE EXPLANATION IS THAT WHEN THE BIKE WAS ENTERED INTO NHTSA, IT WAS ENTERED INCORRECTLY AS AN OFF ROAD BIKE, AND THAT ALTHOUGH ALL PAPERWORK HAS BEEN SUBMITTED, THE WEBSITE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED, AND THE INSPECTION PEOPLE HERE IN KAILUA-KONA WILL NOT INSPECT IT (THIS YEAR) BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THE WEBSITE. I REPEAT, FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS, THE BIKE HAS BEEN REGISTERED AND PASSED INSPECTION. NOW I HAVE A VEHICLE, WITH REGISTRATION UP TO DATE, THAT WON'T PASS BECAUSE, THE DMV BLAMES, YAMAHA, WHICH AGAIN BLAMES DMV. I AM THE ONLY LOSER HERE. YAMAHA HAS OFFERED MANUFACTURER CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN STIPULATING IT CAN BE RIDDEN ON STREETS, BUT THESE WERE NOT RECEIVED BY THE INSPECTION DEPARTMENT PEOPLE IN KAILUA-KONA, HI BECAUSE THEY ABIDE BY WHAT YOUR WEBSITE SAYS.",
