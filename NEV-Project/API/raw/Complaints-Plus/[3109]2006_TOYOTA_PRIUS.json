Recently I had noticed that while sitting at a stoplight I was hearing a tapping noise at the brakes along with what they refer to as a 'seal bark'. The same sounds the car was making just before the actuator failed three years before. A few days later I was driving south on highway 19 in Saint Petersburg during a light rainstorm. Traffic slowed quickly in front of me. I pressed on the brake pedal and the brakes locked up. The ABS was not working. I was barely able to avoid a crash. On September 27th I took the car to the same Toyota dealership that had replaced the actuator three years earlier. I told them about the noises at the brakes and told them these were the same sounds the car was making when the actuator failed the first time. They checked it out and told me that everything was working fine and that the car was not issuing any error codes. They could hear the same  noises that I could, but said that I would need to continue to drive the car until the actuator failed to the point that it lit up dash lights or issued error codes. I logged on to PriusChat to search for what other people were seeing. I am not alone in this. Many others have had the same experience with the dealerships saying 'drive it till it fails'. Drive it until you lose your brakes? If I'm in this situation, then how many other Prius owners are driving around with dangerous brakes. I have no choice but to wait until the failure gets worse. If you search results on PriusChat for 'actuator', I think you will see that this probably means that there are thousands of cars just like mine out there on the roads.  I got 169,689 miles out of the first actuator and just 22,000 out of the second one. Based on what I've seen on PriusChat, the new part seems to be worse than the original part.",

I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, AND DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY, AND TO A GAS STATION.   THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER COULDN'T EVEN JUMP THE BATTERY ENOUGH TO GET THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, AND HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING IT UP ON THE FLATBED TO TOW IT HOME.  I COULDN'T EVEN LOCK THE DOORS.  I HAD A NEW KEY MADE AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 10/17/19 AND I WAS USING THAT KEY FOR HOURS DRIVING TO CT AND A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER I WAS HALF WAY HOME WHEN EVERYTHING IN THE CAR STOPPED WORKING.  I WAS TOWED TO MY HOME IN MD BECAUSE I NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO UNPACK MY CAR AND COMPUTER BEFORE TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.   WHEN THE SECOND TOW CAME THE NEXT DAY, I HANDED HIM THE KEY BY THE FRONT DOOR, WHICH WAS MY OLD KEY, AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR IN NEUTRAL RIGHT AWAY, AND AT THE DEALERSHIP THE CAR WORKED JUST FINE.   THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THE NEW KEY.

THE MECHANIC TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE SHOP AND WHEN HE FINISHED I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE  BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY GOING BAD AND WAS QUOTED $2700 TO HAVE IT REPLACED.  I WAS ADVISED THAT I WOULD KNOW KNOW WHEN IT FAILED COMPLETELY  WHEN SEVERAL OF THE WARNING LIGHTS  ILLUMINATED.  YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING 55MPH ON A 4 LANE HIGHWAY ALL OF THE RELATED WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON.  FORTUNATELY THE BRAKES STILL WORKED AND I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME SAFELY. AFTER EXPLORING THE INTERNET I FOUND THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON DANGEROUS FAILURE AND THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT TOYOTA HAS STOPPED PROVIDING REPLACEMENT WHEN THIS PART FAILS ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE.",

WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL DONE ON THESE VEHICLES? OBVIOUSLY TOYOTA IS AWARE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH IN THE SYSTEM OR THEY WOULD NOT OF SETTLED THE CLASS ACTION SUIT. WE NOW HAVE A VEHICLE THAT WE PAID $15000 FOR THAT CAN NOT BE DRIVEN AT NIGHT OR WHEN IT IS RAINING OUT, BECAUSE THE FAULTY HEADLIGHT INSTALLED BY THE MANUFACTURE. HOW CAN THE GOVERNMENT ALLOW A MAJOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURE TO ALLOW THESE CARS TO STAY ON THE ROAD, AND RISK SERIOUS INJURY?    *TR",

NOW ABOUT ANOTHER 3 YEARS AND 145K MILES, THE SAME PROBLEM.  TOYOTA U.S.A. ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM AND THAT IN SOME CASES THE HID HEADLIGHT CONTROL ECU MAY HAVE BEEN REPLACED BUT WAS UNNECESSARY, NEEDING ONLY BULB REPLACEMENT AND REDUCING THE PRICING TO $150/BULB. WHILE MOST VEHICLES TODAY OPERATE WITH HEADLIGHTS ON AUTOMATICALLY, I'VE ONLY USED MY DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS TO PRESERVE HEADLIGHT LIFE BUT THESE BULBS ARE STILL A PROBLEM. HEADLIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL VEHICLE EQUIPMENT AND MUST BE RELIABLE. HEADLAMPS THAT FAIL EVERY 3 YEARS DO NOT MEET THE RELIABILITY TEST IN MY VIEW.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ONGOING ISSUE.  I'M ASKING TOYOTA TO WORK WITH ME ON REPLACEMENT COST AND THE TYPE OF HID BULB THEY'RE USING.  I'M TOLD BY MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS THAT VISUAL INSPECTION WILL SHOW A SMALL BUBBLE SOMEWHERE IN THE BASE THAT INDICATES IT'S GOING BAD.

AT THE END OF TRAVEL, THE POWER STEERING IS FORCING THE LINKAGE TO TURN EVEN THOUGH THE DRIVER IS JUST SLIGHTLY TURNING THE WHEEL.  THE RACK AND PINION AND THE ASSOCIATED SHAFT AND LINK WERE DESIGNED FOR NON BOOSTED FORCES.  THE SECOND DESIGN DEFECT IS THE FACT THAT THIS SAFETY CRITICAL PART DOESN'T INCLUDE SOME TYPE OF REDUNDANCY FOR FAILED SPLINES.  IN STATE OF THE ART DESIGNS AVAILABLE SINCE THE 1970S, THE CLAMPING BOLT PROVIDES A SECONDARY FAIL- SAFE FOR LOOSING THE SPLINE INTERFACE.  IF THE SPLINES FAIL, THE BOLT INTERFERES WITH THE SHAFT AFTER A FEW DEGREES OF MOVEMENT.  THIS GIVES THE DRIVER A SLOPPY BUT SAFE WAY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  UNLIKE THE PRIUS FAILURE, THIS SYSTEM CAN KEEP THE DRIVER IN CONTROL.   MY TOYOTA DEALER DID NOTHING FOR ME BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY.  TOYOTA CUSTOMER LINE DID NOTHING. *TR..UPDATED 06/28/13 *BF UPDATED 07/1/2013 *JS",

I PULLED OFF THE ROAD TO CHECK THE MANUAL AND TURNED THE CAR OFF.  WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON MANY WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE CAR OUT OF PARK.  CALLED THE DEALER.  THEY TOLD ME TO GET TOWED TO THE DEALER, WHICH I DID.  AFTER 2 DAYS THEY DETERMINED THAT IT NEEDED A NEW HYBRID TRANSAXLE FOR $5,000+ PLUS MISCELLANEOUS OTHER REPAIRS TOTALING $7,723.

TWO DAYS AGO, AFTER DRIVING 30 MINUTES IN RAIN WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON, I FOUND THE LEFT HEADLIGHT WAS OUT.

I HAVE TEENAGE DRIVERS - THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, NOT JUST A MAINTENANCE ISSUE!  BOTH LIGHTS COULD BURN OUT ON A DARK UNLIT ROAD WITHOUT WARNING AND THE DRIVER -- ESPECIALLY AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER -- COULD HAVE A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I HAVE NO IDEA IF THE PREVIOUS OWNER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WHEN THE CAR HAD LESS THAN 50,000 MILES OR NOT.

I DID NOT PUSHED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL IN ORDER TO TURN ONTO THE ROAD SLOWLY. BUT THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED REALLY FAST. AS IT DID SO THE RED TRIANGLE 'PROBLEM - CHECK ENGINE' SYMBOL CAME UP ON THE DASHBOARD. THE CAR WENT ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO A NEIGHBOR'S FRONT YARD WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF SNOW AND A SNOWDRIFT BY THE ROAD, AND RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE SNOWDRIFT WHICH STOPPED IT. I WAS THEN ABLE TO TURN OFF THE POWER. THE FOOT BRAKE HAD  NO EFFECT.  THE CAR WAS HEADING ON A LINE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE HOUSE AND HAD THERE NOT BEEN THAT SNOWDRIFT THERE, WOULD HAVE HIT THE HOUSE HEAD-ON.  THIS WAS NOT DRIVER ERROR, BUT 'UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION'.  THERE MAY BE A CONNECTION TO THE FOLLOWING BATTERY FAILURE: ON 1/11/11 A RECENTLY INSTALLED START-MOTOR BATTERY (INSTALLED 1/3/11) WENT DEAD, AFTER 1636 MILES, AND HAD ITSELF TO BE REPLACED.

TOYOTA CALLS THIS \"TRACTION CONTROL\".  I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.  IT'S REALLY COMPUTER CONTROLLED TRACTION LOSS.  THE OCCURRENCE REPORTED IS ONLY THE LATEST.  IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS.  COMPLAINTS TO TOYOTA HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS, BECAUSE THEY SAY THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING WITHIN DESIGN LIMITS.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OVER-REVVING OF ENGINE COMPONENTS AND STRESSING THEM. *TR",

NOW, THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR HAS ONCE AGAIN FAILED, ALONG WITH THE PASSENGER'S SIDE ACTUATOR.    MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE ESTIMATED REPAIR COST WOULD TOTAL $1,300.  I INDICATED THAT IN VIEW OF THE EXTREMELY HIGH REPAIR COST AND THE PRIOR REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE ACTUATOR, TOYOTA SHOULD ASSUME A SHARE OF THE REPAIR COST, AND THE DEALERSHIP SUBMITTED THE MATTER TO THEIR REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE.    THE DEALERSHIP SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED ME THAT THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE WAS OFFERING TO ASSUME $300 OF THE REPAIR COST AS A CUSTOMER GOODWILL GESTURE.  I INDICATED THAT TOYOTA SHOULD ASSUME A GREATER PORTION OF THE OVERALL EXPENSE FOR THE CURRENT REPAIR, AND THE DEALERSHIP ONCE AGAIN AGREED TO CONVEY THAT POINT TO THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE.    HOWEVER, THE DEALERSHIP SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED ME THAT, RATHER THAN OFFERING ANY FURTHER ADJUSTMENT, THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE'S RESPONSE WAS TO WITHDRAW ITS PREVIOUS OFFER ALTOGETHER, LEAVING ME WITH THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR THE REPAIR!  I THEN CONTACTED THE NATIONAL TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA, TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE'S SUMMARY RETRACTION OF THE ADJUSTMENT THAT IT HAD ALREADY OFFERED.  A REPRESENTATIVE AT THE CENTER SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED ME THAT HE CONCURRED WITH THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE'S ACTIONS AND WAS UNWILLING TO REVERSE THEM.    AGAINST THE RECENT BACKDROP OF WIDESPREAD AND SERIOUS MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH ITS PRODUCTS, THE TOYOTA CORPORATION HAS PUBLICLY PLEDGED A RENEWED EMPHASIS ON QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  HOWEVER, THE WAY IN WHICH IT HAS CHOSEN TO HANDLE MY COMPLAINT HAS LEFT ME FEELING BEWILDERED, DISRESPECTED, AND ABANDONED.

TOYOTA SAID IT WAS THE BULB AND REPLACED IT AT ABOUT 34,000 MILES UNDER WARRANTY, BUT IT DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING.  THEN THE NEXT CHANCE I HAD TO BRING IT IN IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SO THEY WILL NOT COVER.  I THOUGHT IT MAY BE THE IGNITER OR TRANSFORMER SO I REPLACED THAT, BUT IT STILL DOES THE SAME THING. I SEE MANY PRIUS' AROUND TOWN WITH THEIR RIGHT FRONT LIGHT OUT, SO IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE COMMON.  I READ ON THE INTERNET THAT LOTS OF PRIUS PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM, BUT OF COURSE TOYOTA DENIES THAT THERE IS ONE.  TOYOTA SIMPLY CHARGES $300. TO REPLACE THE BULB, OR $600 TO REPLACE THE IGNITER, OR $1,100 TO REPLACE THE WHOLE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLE.  REPLACING THE BULB DOES NOT FIX IT, NEITHER DOES THE IGNITER, NOT SURE ABOUT THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY.  THE LIGHT GOES OFF WHETHER THE CAR IS PARKED OR DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, SO VIBRATION IS NOT THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD. TOYOTA IS PRODUCING LEMONS, THEN SIMPLY REPLACING THE BULBS AND HOPING YOUR WARRANTY RUNS OUT.  TOYOTA IS MAKING A TON OF MONEY OFF OF THIS DEFECT AT $1,100 PER LIGHT ASSEMBLY, AND EVEN THEN I AM NOT SURE THE PROBLEM IS BEING REPAIRED. THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE MORE COMMON ON 2006 AND 2007 MODELS.  I JUST DROVE TO THE AIRPORT AND BACK (45 MIN EACH WAY) AND MY LIGHT WENT OUT PROBABLY 30 TIMES.  MANY OWNERS DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THAT THEIR LIGHT IS OUT.  I NOTICE, BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I AM A HUGE ROAD HAZARD.  I WOULD REPAIR IT IF  I KNEW WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM WAS.  THE TOYOTA FACTORY SURELY KNOWS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW TO CORRECT IT, BUT IF THEY BRING THE PROBLEM TO THE SURFACE THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE FORCED TO PAY FOR ANOTHER RECALL, MEANWHILE THEY MAKE A TON OF PROFIT OFF PARTS AND REPAIRS. *TR",

I EVEN WENT FOR A NIGHT TIME DRIVE WITH MY SALESPERSON RIGHT AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND HE SAW THE LIGHTS GO OFF.  HE SAID I WOULD JUST HAVE TO REPLACE THEM AT MY COST EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY WERE GOING ON AND OFF WHEN WE HIT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BUMP IN ROAD AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY A CERTIFIED USED CAR.  TOYOTA KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ISSUED A STATEMENT AND THERE ARE BLOGS ALL OVER THE INTERNET ABOUT IT, YET THEY REFUSE TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS MAINTAIN A SAFE OPERATING VEHICLE.  I'VE AGAIN CALLED THE DEALER AND HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

MY DAUGHTER WAS PROBABLY GOING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 45 MPH WHEN AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE BROUGHT TRAFFIC TO A HALT, MY DAUGHTER PUT ON BRAKES BUT STILL ENDING UP HITTING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF HER RESULTING IN TOTALING THE PRIUS.  THANKFULLY, SHE WAS NOT INJURED, BUT THE PEOPLE SHE HIT HAVE A CLAIM IN FOR INJURIES, THOUGH NONE VISIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HIT THE CAR IN FRONT SQUARE ON COMPLETELY DEMOLISHING THE FRONT END NONE OF HER AIR BAGS DEPLOYED, NONE.  ON CALLING JULISSA AT TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED NOT TO DEPLOY IN THIS TYPE OF ACCIDENT.  I WAS DUMBFOUNDED, WHEN WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DEPLOY IF NOT DURING A FRONT END COLLISION AT ABOUT 35 MPH.  AFTER I STOPPED SHAKING MY HEAD FROM DISBELIEF I CALLED BACK AND SPOKE TO A SUPERVISOR WHO IN TURN EXPLAINED THAT THE AIR BAGS REACTED AS DESIGNED, I SUGGESTED AT THAT POINT THAT PERHAPS THERE MAY BE A DESIGN FLAW.  I AM NOT A ROCKET SCIENTIST BUT I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT AIR BAGS ARE DESIGNED FOR, AFTERALL I DID PAY ALL THAT MONEY FOR THEM.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS NOT HAPPY AND AM STILL UPSET THAT THEY WOULD THINK THE PUBLIC IS SO STUPID.  AS I MENTIONED THE CAR WAS TOTALED AND AT THE TIME WAS VALUED AT $17,000.  I RECEIVED A FULL PAY OFF FOR THE CAR BUT FEEL THEY OWE ME SOMETHING FOR THE EQUITY THAT WAS LOST WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED.

I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 MILES PER HOUR TO MAKE A Y-TURN TO BACK INTO OUR DRIVEWAY AND WHEN I PUSHED DOWN ON THE BRAKE THE CAR THRUSTED FORWARD WHILE ON ELECTRIC WITH GREAT FORCE THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S SIX FOOT WOODEN FENCE WHERE THE CAR STOPPED (I DON'T KNOW IF IT STOPPED ON IT'S OWN OR GOT HUNG UP IN FENCE AND ALSO STUCK FROM HILL DECLINE.)

MY GAS PEDAL WAS NOT STUCK AND THE MAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. MY HUSBAND CHECKED THE MAT AND ACTUALLY KICKED AT THE MAT TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE AND IT DID NOT. OUR MAT WAS NOT EVEN UNDER THE GAS PEDAL. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE MY HIGH HEELS MADE THE GAS PEDAL STICK. I DO NOT WEAR HIGH HEELS AND MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT THRUSTED FORWARD WHEN I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU HAVE MORE OF AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION OF SOME TYPE.

IT WAS DAYTIME, AND I WAS DRIVING WITH MY CHILDREN IN BOSTON, APPROACHING THE FOREST HILLS INTERSECTION.

THUS THE CAR KEPT GOING, VEERING TO THE RIGHT, WITH ONE WHEEL BANGING INTO AND UP ONTO A CURB, BEFORE THE CAR STOPPED. THE WHOLE THING TOOK ONLY A FEW SECONDS.

I CHECKED AND POSTED TO PRIUSCHAT.COM ON IT YEARS AGO, AND FOUND MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  NOTE THAT THE COMMON WISDOM ON THE SITE IS THAT THE ISSUE IS ACTUALLY \"TRACTION CONTROL\" THAT AGGRESSIVELY DISENGAGES THE DRIVETRAIN WHEN THE WHEELS SPIN AT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIAL, IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE DRIVETRAIN.  THIS ACTION DISENGAGES REGENERATIVE BRAKING.  THE SWITCH TO CONVENTIONAL FRICTION BRAKING HAS A DELAY, AND CAUSES THE (QUITE STARTLING AND SCARY) ABSENCE OF BRAKING FOR A BRIEF PERIOD.    THIS EXPLANATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT AN ANALOGOUS PROBLEM HAPPENS FOR ACCELERATION, WHEN HITTING UNEVEN PAVEMENT, POTHOLES, ETC.  I.E., ACCELERATION IS MOMENTARILY DISENGAGED.

(PS - THIS FORM REQUIRES ME TO PUT IN AN INCIDENT DATE - THERE ARE MULTIPLE WITH NO SPECIFIC DATE, SO I AM PUTTING TODAY'S DATE). *TR",

MY PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT HAD BEEN RANDOMLY TURNING OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND IN ORDER TO GET MY LIGHT TO TURN BACK ON I WOULD HAVE TO STOP MY CAR, TURN MY LIGHTS OFF, THEN TURN THEM BACK ON, AND OCCASIONALLY THIS WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM.    RECENTLY MY HEADLIGHT WENT OUT COMPLETELY AND I TOOK MY CAR TO TOYOTA OF DUBLIN SERVICE CENTER TO HAVE ONE OF MY HEADLIGHTS REPLACED. I WAS THEN SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT MY CAR HAD HID LIGHTS THAT COST $400 PER BULB PLUS LABOR TO REPLACE. MY FRONT BUMPER NEEDED TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO GET TO THE LIGHTS THEREFORE IT WAS NOT A SIMPLE JOB AND WOULD TAKE A FEW HOURS TO COMPLETE. HEARING THIS APPALLED ME! WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I WAS NEVER TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT REPLACING THE LIGHTS AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST. THIS IS A RIDICULOUS CHARGE FOR LIGHTS THAT DO NOT LAST THREE YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MORE WRONG WITH THIS CAR THAN JUST A LIGHT THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I FEEL THAT THE FAULTY LIGHTS IN THE 2006 TOYOTA PRIUS ARE A SAFETY HAZARD AND NEED TO BE RECALLED.    I AM A SINGLE MOTHER WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CAR WITH MY CHILDREN, NOR DO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT SELLING MY CAR TO AN UNKNOWING BUYER, AND I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO KEEP PAYING REPAIR BILLS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1000 OR MORE TO REPLACE HEADLIGHTS!

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A LIGHTBULB PROBLEM BECAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD COME BACK ON AFTER CYCLING THE SWITCH.

INVESTIGATING THIS ON THE INTERNET TURNED UP HUNDREDS OF POSTS ABOUT THE SAME EXACT ISSUE, OFTEN ON THE 2006 MODEL YEAR TOYOTA PRIUS.    THE LIGHT RANDOMLY TURNS ON AND OFF - WHICH IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, NOT TO MENTION THE EXPENSE OF GETTING IT REPLACED.    WE WERE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL WE WERE STOPPED BY THE POLICE AND GIVEN A WARNING TO GET THE HEADLIGHT REPLACED.    WITH SO MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THE TOYOTA PRIUS HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, I WONDER WHY TOYOTA IS NOT ISSUING A RECALL.     TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE DEALER WAS NOT EVEN SURE IF THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE HEADLIGHT OR WITH THE \"COMPUTER\" THAT CONTROLLED IT. I WAS TOLD TODAY THAT THEY WOULD FIRST REPLACE THE HEADLIGHT (FOR $299) AND IF THAT DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE COMPUTER FOR AN AS-YET UNDISCLOSED COST.    PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AND URGE TOYOTA TO RECALL THE HEADLIGHTS AND/OR THE \"COMPUTERS\".    THANKS  MOHAN *TR",

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT UNLESS IT FAILED IN THEIR SHOP.  I SAID THAT IT COULD SIT THERE FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE EITHER ONE OF THEM SHUT DOWN.  ABOUT 3 HOURS LATER, THE RIGHT LAMP SHUT DOWN.....THEY FIXED IT NO CHARGE (IT WAS UNDER THE NORMAL 36/36 WARRANTY....BUT SAID IT WOULD NOT BE FIXED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY - WHICH I BOUGHT FOR ABOUT $1000 WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR).

WELL, THE LEFT LAMP DID SHUT DOWN AGAIN WITHIN THE WEEK.  I PULLED OVER AND TOOK A PICTURE OF THE LEFT LAMP OUT AND THE RIGHT ONE ON.  SINCE THEN, THE LEFT LAMP GOES OUT NEARLY EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR AND HEADLIGHTS ON.

I WAS TOLD THAT TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM IT WOULD REQUIRE A NEW PART TO BE INSTALLED AT A COST OF APPROX. $400.00.  I INDICATED AT THE TIME THAT I WAS UNPREPARED FINANCIALLY TO PAY 400.00 TO FIX THE ISSUE. IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH QUITE A FEW PRIUS MODELS.  IN FACT CURRENTLY I CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS VERY OFTEN MY LEFT, RIGHT AND SOMETIMES BOTH HEADLIGHTS WILL SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING THE CAR.  THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AT NIGHT AS I HAVE FOUND MYSELF DRIVING ON THE ROAD AND BOTH HEADLIGHTS SHUTTING OFF AT THE SAME TIME.  THE WORK-AROUND FOR THIS SAFETY HAZARD IS CURRENTLY TO TURN OFF AND TURN BACK ON THE HEADLIGHTS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION.  I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS CAR EXCEPT FOR THIS  DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND FEEL THAT AS A CONSUMER I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE A CAR IN WHICH I AM CONFIDENT THE HEADLIGHTS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOME FAULT IN THE DESIGN OR PERFORMANCE OF THE HEADLIGHTS MECHANISM AND TOYOTA SHOULD PERFORM A RECALL ON THIS, OR AT LEAST PAY FOR THE NECESSARY FIXES TO REPAIR THIS ISSUE. *TR",

SOMETIMES I WOULD BE DRIVING ON CITY STREETS, NOT AWARE THAT THEY HAD GONE OFF, AND OTHER DRIVERS WOULD STOP ME AND TELL ME THAT MY HEADLIGHTS WERE OFF.  I WOULD CHECK THE SWITCH, SEE THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON, TOGGLE THE SWITCH AND THEY WOULD COME ON.  I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I HAVE ALL MY MAINTENANCE DONE.  AFTER INVESTIGATING FOR A FEW DAYS, THEY REPLACED BOTH H.I.D. HEADLIGHTS AND CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.  NOW, 20,000 MILES LATER, I'M EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY LEFT HEADLIGHT SUDDENLY WILL GO OUT AND HAVE TO BE TURNED OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN TO LIGHT.  THIS HAPPENS EVERY FEW MINUTES, MOST ALARMINGLY ON CROWDED FREEWAYS AT NIGHT.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER, AND THEY REPLACED THE LEFT HEADLIGHT.  THEY DIDN'T CHARGE ME FOR THE LIGHT BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, BUT I DID HAVE TO PAY THE LABOR FEES, SINCE THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, BUT EXHIBITING THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT IT DID WHEN IT WAS.  I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A DANGEROUS AND COSTLY PROBLEM.  I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT THAT MY CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT, BECAUSE UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE PROBLEM, HEADLIGHT FAILURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE HAS OCCURRED UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.  ALSO, IT DOESN'T SEEM REASONABLE THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO REPLACE A VERY EXPENSIVE PART EVERY 20,000 MILES OR MORE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE MY CAR SAFELY. *TR",

MY HEADLIGHTS HAVE \"INTERMITTENT\" FAILURE AND HAVE BEEN BEHAVING AS SUCH FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS. AS NOTED BY OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM CYCLING THE HEADLIGHTS AND HITTING THE PLASMA WITH THE INITIAL HIGH VOLTAGE CHARGE WILL ALLOW THEM TO WORK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT NOT ALWAYS.

AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AT NIGHT AND REQUIRES ME TO PULL OVER AND \"CYCLE\" UNTIL MY LIGHTS ARE RESTORED.    THROUGH EXTENSIVE REPLACEMENTS AND POSTINGS ON WWW.PRIUSCHAT.COM IT IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE D4R ITSELF AND NOT THE BALLAST OR ANY TYPE OF WIRING ISSUES. AT AS MUCH AS $300 EACH THROUGH TOYOTA THESE BULBS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE. IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE BURDENED WITH THIS CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM SEEMS READILY APPARENT TO ALL 2006 OWNERS.    ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE HAS VERY HIGH MILEAGE (144,000) 70-80% OF THOSE MILES ARE DRIVEN DURING THE DAY AND I DO NOT RUN THE HEADLIGHTS DURING THE DAY.

THIS IS VERY DISTURBING AND SCARY.  MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP NOW AGAIN AND TOYOTA IS TELLING ME THAT IT IS \"NORMAL \" TO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHTS AFTER 50,000 MILES.  THEY ARE STILL LOOKING AT IT AS A HEADLIGHT BULB PROBLEM.  THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME THAT THERE IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE WIRING OR COMPUTER SOMEWHERE IN THE CAR.  THE INTERNET IS FILLED WITH COMPLAINTS OF PRIUS HEADLIGHT PROBLEMS, BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL TOYOTA IS IGNORING IT.  I HAVE EVEN BROUGHT THEM THE LISTS OFF OF THE INTERNET, AND THEY SAY THAT \"EVERYONE COMPLAINS ON THE INTERNET\". *TR",

TYPICALLY, THE ANTI-SKID (VSC) LIGHT COMES ON FULLY OR FLICKERS FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND THE CAR MOMENTARILY STOPS BRAKING (YOU CAN FEEL THE CAR ACCELERATE FORWARD SLIGHTLY AND THE PEDAL FEELS LIKE IT IS ON THE FLOOR).

IF I HAVE THE REACTION TIME & FORETHOUGHT, IMMEDIATELY LETTING GO OF THE BRAKE PEDAL COMPLETELY AND PRESSING DOWN HARD WILL GET THE CAR TO STOP.

AFTER BEING IN THE BUILDING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES I CAME OUT AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START.  CALLED DEALER.  DEALER SAID THAT THE PRIUS WAS A COMPLICATED CAR AND I PROBABLY WAS CONFUSING THE COMPUTER BY THE WAY I WAS SEQUENCING THE START OF THE ENGINE.  IN ANY CASE I LET THE CAR SIT FOR A HALF HOUR AND TRIED AGAIN AND IT STARTED UP.  SINCE THEN  THE PRIUS HAS GONE DEAD AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES.  SOMETIMES I COULD WAIT AND IT WOULD START UP.  OTHER TIMES I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IT JUMPED.      I HAVE HAD IT TOWED TO JACK TAYLOR TOYOTA THREE TIMES. EACH TIME THEY INSISTED THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR (ALTHOUGH THEY DID REPLACE THE AUX BATTERY).  THEY INSISTED THAT IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WAY I DRIVE THE CAR AND SUGGESTED OVER AND OVER THAT I DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR ENOUGH MILES.  HOWEVER, I DRIVE THE PRIUS, WHEN IT IS NOT DEAD, 250 TO 300 MILES A WEEK AND IT TYPICALLY GOES DEAD AFTER I HAVE DRIVEN IT SOMEWHERE.    THE LAST TIME I TOOK THE PRIUS TO THE DEALER WAS SPRING OF 2008, THEY AGAIN INSISTED NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I REFUSED TO TAKE IT BACK.  WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA NORTH AMERICA. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP TALKED TO THE HEAD MECHANIC AT JACK TAYLOR AND CLOSED THE CASE SAYING IT WAS MY FAULT THAT HE CAR WAS GOING DEAD.  SHE THEN THREATENED ME BY SAYING THAT I WOULD BE CHARGED FOR THE LOANER UNLESS I PICKED UP THE PRIUS.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AT JACK TAYLOR ARRANGED FOR US TO USE ONE OF THE DEALER CARS AND SAID HE WOULD TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT.  ON SEPT 30 WE HAD TO RETURN THE LOANER AND PICK UP THE PRIUS.    THE PRIUS WENT DEAD AGAIN ON OCTOBER 3RD AT 2:00 PM.    I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PRIUS RECALL FOR 2004 AND 2005 MODELS FOR A SIMILAR PROBLEM.    THE MECHANIC INSISTS THAT SOFTWARE PROBLEM WAS FIXED AND IT IS \"IMPOSSIBLE\"  THAT THE 2006 COULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.    I WOULD LIKE SOME FEED BACK FROM NHTSA. *TR",

ON JULY 21, HOWEVER, IT OCCURRED AGAIN, LASTING MUCH LONGER. I WAS TRAVELING ON A ROAD AT ABOUT 45 MPH, THEN SLOWED TO 35MPH FOR A SLOWER MOVING VEHICLE. I WAITED FOR A TIME TO PASS, THEN CHANGED LANES AND ACCELERATED TO PASS. EXACTLY AFTER, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PASS THE ACCELERATION INCREASED WITH A BIG SURGE OF POWER, ENGINE REVVING. I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW THE CAR, FIRST TAPPING THE BRAKES THEN FULL  BRAKING BUT THE ACCELERATION WAS GREATER AND MY BRAKES WOULD NOT STOP THE ACCELERATION. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WAS COMING UP ONTO A BUSY INTERSECTION WITH A STOP SIGN BUT WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE CAR. I WAS ABLE TO SLOW IT ENOUGH WITH THE BRAKE TO GET AROUND THE CORNER. I RAISED MY FEET OFF THE FLOOR, KEEPING BOTH HANDS TIGHTLY CLUTCHED ON STEERING WHEEL. THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE UNTIL IT REACHED 62 MPH, THEN IT SUDDENLY STOPPED ACCELERATING. I THEN HAD CONTROL OF THE CAR AGAIN. WENT  TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT. WE HAVE A 8 YEAR OR 80,000 MILE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING AND ENDED UP CHARGING ME $80. THIS PROBLEM DOES EXIST. AND SCARED ME. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN. TODAY I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND OTHER REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM, ONE THAT ENDED UP IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  SEE HTTP://WWW.CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/NEWS04/2008/06/PRIUS_RECONSIDERED I HOPE THAT YOU WILL INVESTIGATE AND MAKE TOYOTA FIND THE PROBLEM BEFORE ANYBODY GETS KILLED.    THE TOYOTA PEOPLE COULD NOT MAKE IT HAPPEN AGAIN, AND ASCERTAINED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG.  *TR",

I WAS SURE THAT WITHIN THE HOUR THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK AT IT THAT IT SURELY WOULD GO OUT FOR THEM, BUT THE SERVICE MAN TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO GO OUT.  I HAVE NOW SCHEDULED TO TAKE IT BACK TO LEAVE IT FOR A DAY SO THEY CAN TROUBLE SHOOT IT.  MY CAR IS NO LONGER COVERED BECAUSE I HAVE 57,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",

TAKING IT IN TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN VA WHERE WE PURCHASED THE CAR, WE WERE TOLD THAT SINCE IT HAPPENED TO BE WORKING AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. SINCE MOVING TO NORTH CAROLINA IN JULY 2007, THIS PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE. A DEALERSHIP HERE, TOLD MY HUSBAND AND I THE SAME THING - THAT THE HEADLIGHT WAS ON WHEN WE BROUGHT IT IN SO THEY ASSUMED IT WAS FINE. AFTER BEING PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE IN EARLY MAY 2008 BECAUSE OUR HEADLIGHT WAS OUT, WE BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. WE WERE TOLD BY THE POLICE THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND WE NEEDED TO GET IT REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY. THIS TIME, AFTER PAYING NEARLY $100.00 FOR THE PROBLEM TO BE DIAGNOSED AT THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, WE SPENT ALMOST $500.00 FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE COMPUTER (ECU)AND WERE TOLD THE HEADLIGHT WOULD NOW WORK. THE NEXT DAY THE HEADLIGHT WENT OUT AGAIN. WE BROUGHT IT BACK IN AND WERE TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE HEAT CAUSED BY THE ECU THAT HAD BEEN REPLACED, OUR HEADLIGHT HAD NOW FULLY BLOWN OUT AND WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ALMOST $400.00 FOR A NEW HID LIGHT. WE PAID, GOT A NEW DRIVER SIDE HEADLIGHT, AND WENT HOME. THE VERY NEXT MORNING (5/30/08), THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT WENT OUT. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING VERY WRONG WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE. THERE ARE PAGES AND PAGES ONLINE OF DISCUSSIONS OF 2006 PRIUS OWNERS WHO HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR HEADLIGHTS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN, AND IT IS ILLEGAL TO DRIVE WITH HEADLIGHTS OUT! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY TOYOTA IS NOT STANDING BEHIND IT'S VEHICLES AND KEEPING IT'S CUSTOMERS SAFE.  THERE IS SURELY A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN.  THESE LIGHTS ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST UP TO EIGHT YEARS... BUT OURS HAVE NOT MADE IT EVEN THREE YEARS.

ABOUT 2 MILES FROM THE GAS TANK THE \"ADD FUEL\" WARNING CAME ON IN THE VEHICLE.  UPON PULLING INTO THE GAS STATION AND ADDING GAS INTO THE VEHICLE I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET SLIGHTLY OVER 4 GALLONS INTO THE TANK.  THE PRIUS HAD AN 11.9 GALLON GAS TANK.

EVEN IF THE 1/4 TANK MEANS THERE ARE 3 GALLONS LEFT IN THE TANK, THOSE 3 PLUS THE 4 THAT I GOT IN THE TANK STILL ONLY ADD UP TO 7 GALLONS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 4+ GALLONS THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT IN THE TANK?  THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I PUT GAS IN THE VEHICLE.

I CURRENTLY CAN NOT DRIVE MY CAR AT NIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD. MY LIGHTS COULD TURN OFF AT ANY SECOND AND I COULD EASILY GET HIT/AND OR KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO FAILING HEADLIGHTS.     I AM CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH TOYOTA AND THIS ISSUE. I ALSO HAVE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY CAR WHICH I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY FOR AND THEY ARE CLAIMING THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. I AM SORRY BUT IF THERE ARE NUMEROUS 2006 PRIUS OUT THERE THAT ARE HAVING THIS DEFECT, THEN IT SHOULD BE TURNED INTO A RECALL RATHER THAN HAVE EVERYONE PAY FOR THEIR OWN NEW $900 LIGHTBULBS! I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS CAR IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE SPECIAL LIGHTBULBS EVERY 2 YEARS FOR $900!  *TR",

I TOLD THEM THAT I BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE FUEL SENSOR AND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE MY CAR DIED WHILE TRAVELING ON AN INTERSTATE.

OTHER AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS I HAVE OWNED WITH ELECTRIC WINDOWS HAVE HAD AN AUTOMATIC DOWN FEATURE ON THE DRIVERS WINDOW. IE- ONCE DRIVER STARTED WINDOW DOWN HE COULD RELEASE PRESSURE ON SWITCH AND THE WINDOW WOULD CONTINUE ITS DOWN TRAVEL TO THE BOTTOM. ON MY NEW TOYOTA THE DRIVERS WINDOW WILL ALSO CONTINUE GOING UP TO THE FULL UP POSITION AFTER SWITCH IS RELEASED. I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE TOYOTA SERVICE DEPT THINKING THE SWITCH WAS DEFECTIVE. I WAS TOLD IT WAS DESIGNED THIS WAY SO THE DRIVER COULD GET HIS HANDS BACK ON THE STEERING WHEEL RAPIDLY. THEY SAID IT PROBABLY HAD A STOP IF SOMETHING GOT STUCK IN THE WINDOW - LIKE A BABY'S HEAD. I HAVE TRIED TO HOLD MY WINDOW DOWN AFTER RELEASING THE SWITCH AND I CANNOT STOP ITS UPWARD TRAVEL. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE WINDOW IS TO FIND THE SWITCH AGAIN AND DEPRESS THE SWITCH TO THE LOWER WINDOW POSITION.    I FEEL THE WINDOW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO  KILL OR MAIM ANYONE THAT GETS CAUGHT BY THE WINDOW. I FEEL THIS IS AN URGENT THREAT.    THANK YOU. *NM",
