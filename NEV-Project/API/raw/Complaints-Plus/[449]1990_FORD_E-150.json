        "summary": "Picked up vehicle from auto shop, work had been done on the front brakes, engine temp sensor, heater blower relay, map sensor, throttle control position sensor and ECM had been replaced. Shortly after I got on the freeway the vehicle started to accelerate very quickly W/O pushing the gas pedal hit the brakes but only slowed from 65 mph to 60. Gas pedal did not move from middle position up or down and brakes seamed mushy. Cruise control was not on, tried switching it on then off. Could not slow down, so went to great effort to avoid hitting any other vehicles. trying to slow down for an off ramp came close to crashing off the the edge into a ditch.Tried the emergency brake and downshifting. Finally turned off the key and started slowing down, car lurched forward and hit a crosswalk button pole. Utility pole was damaged also cars bumper, grill, hood, radiator, brakes, possibly transmission. State patrol arrived, vehicle towed to tow yard lot. No ticket was issued. Vehicle never had this issue prior to the auto shop updates, I notified the shop but they have not followed up on anything - they stated that they would contact their insurance provider but I do not believe they have done so. ECM computer, software, fuel system sensors were possibly not installed correctly. Vehicle is available for inspection upon request. Has not been inspected since the incident. My safety and the safety of any drivers or pedestrians in the vicinity was put at extreme risk by the vehicle operating at full throttle with no gas pedal control and no brake control.",
