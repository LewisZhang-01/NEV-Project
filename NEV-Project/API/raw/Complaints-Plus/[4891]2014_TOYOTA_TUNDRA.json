Second, the window does not close. I thought it might be caused by a broken breaker BUT, none of the breaker is bad. Thirdly, the most frustrated thing is the transmission fails to work. The truck is dead on the street.  I sent the truck to dealer to replace the transmission to a new one.  After it is done. I drove it on the street and just a few days later, the transmission is failed again and Gear shifting stick failed to work as soon as it is out of dealer parking lot.  Dealer repair department told me I need to put money out to buy another transmission.  They said transmission oil line is broken, and it caused transmission not to be covered by any wanrrenty.  .",

        "summary": "In the course of cleaning my vehicle, I noticed corrosion on edge of door sill (emanating from under inside rubber door seal) of my 2014 Toyota Tundra on June 13, 2021. After removing the plastic scuff plate and rubber door seal, it was apparent that openings from the underside of the vehicle into the cabin are present from the design/manufacturing process - these opening are not sealed.  The openings are not a result of corrosion but rather are associated with the geometry of the floor pan at the floor pan to rocker pinch weld - it is not a sealed surface. After removing the rubber seal I was able to look downward into the openings and see daylight from the underside of the cabin. Electrical cabling is immediately adjacent to these openings beneath the plastic scuff plate. It was apparent that the openings permit water and salt infiltration into the cabin, and would appear to be the primary cause of corrosion and build up of salt residues in the cabin and door sill area.  My first impression was the condition that I observed was a manufacturing defect. On reflection many questions came to mind including: was the infiltration of water, salt and potentially exhaust through the openings in the floor pan going to have safety consequences - would the deterioration of the body structure as a result of corrosion have consequences in the event of a crash, or would the potential infiltration of exhaust gases affect the safety of cabin occupants?  In following up the dealer and manufacturer over the last week, no resolution has been found . Owing to the age I was advised that there was no warranty coverage. The dealer reportedly inspected other Tundras and the design/manufacturing conditions (ie. opening in the floor pan) were the same as I had observed.  It was only through my own initiative that I identified a Manufacturer Communication (NHTSA ID 10173991) that shed some light on the issue.",

I WENT BACK IN MY HOUSE, AS THE TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND 0 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND ALLOWED THE TRUCK TO RUN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. I RETURNED TO MY TRUCK AND LEFT FOR WORK. AFTER DRIVING FOR SEVERAL MILES, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE TRUCK ENTERED \"LIMP MODE.\" I WAS NOT FAR FROM WORK SO I CONTINUED TO WORK, DRIVING AT A MAX SPEED OF 40 MPH. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND ADVISED THEM OF THE PROBLEM. THE TRUCK WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER. ON 2/12/14 I PICKED THE TRUCK UP FROM THE DEALER. I WAS TOLD IT WAS AN AIP (AIR INJECTION PUMP) FAILURE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THERE IS NO FIX, AND THE PROBLEM COULD HAPPEN AGAIN IN COLD CLIMATE. AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE, I GOT NOWHERE. I WAS TOLD THERE IS A FIX IN THE WORKS, BUT FOR NOW I AM LEFT WITH A TRUCK THAT MAY GO INTO LIMP MODE WHEN IT IS COLD OUT. LIVING IN THE NORTH EASTERN UNITED STATES, IT IS COLD HERE FROM OCTOBER TO MID-MARCH.     IF THIS TRUCK WERE TO SUDDENLY ENTER LIMP MODE WHEN I AM ATTEMPTING TO ASCEND A HILL, THIS COULD PRESENT A SAFETY ISSUE TO MYSELF AND OTHER MOTORISTS, AS I WOULD SEVERELY BE IMPEDING THE SAFE FLOW OF TRAFFIC, GOING 10 MPH UPHILL, WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WARNING.  I FEEL THE SUDDEN REDUCTION IN POWER COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE OPERATORS ABILITY TO SAFELY OPERATE THE TRUCK, ESPECIAL WHEN NEGOTIATING TRAFFIC. IT IS EXTREMELY DISHEARTENING TO ME TO KNOWING THAT I BOUGHT A $39,000 TRUCK, TOUTED AS BEING AMONG THE MOST RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE, THAT MAY OR MAY NOT RUN WHEN THE TEMPERATURE FALLS..AND AFTER SPEAKING WITH TOYOTA, THEY KNOW IT IS A PROBLEM..  *TR",
