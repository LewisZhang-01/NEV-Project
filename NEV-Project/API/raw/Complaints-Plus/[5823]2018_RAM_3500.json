I was lead to believe that a new replacement adjuster sleeve would be coming that would not require being welded, once those parts were available, we could have the adjuster sleeve replaced that was welded. Here is the issue, EVERY TRUCK that has had the adjuster sleeve welded has to have those welds ground off when an alignment is done and then REWELDED at the cost to the customer. That doesn't seem right or fair, I'm told there is a new part available for the proper repair but the customer has to purchase this at around $400.00. Why should the customer have to pay $159 to have the adjuster sleeve that was welded per a safety issued recall UNWELDED to have an alignment done and then rewelded. Alignments are a maintenance issue and this cost should not be stuck to the owner of the vehicle, I feel Dodge Ram should be replacing these welded sleeves with the new part available at NO cost to the customer so future alignments can be performed as normal.

The repair according to RAM dealerships is a complete replacement of the screen and the controller at a cost of nearly $2000 per vehicle. While initially most believe this to be a radio issue the systems are integrated to multiple functions of the vehicle including: front and rear cameras, front and rear parking sensors, ride height controls, HVAC controls, seating controls, and a number of other systems. It also includes access to a number of phone systems including emergency calling. Due to the integrated nature of this equipment a major recall should be conducted on affected systems and also a forced reimbursement to owners of vehicles that have had to pay out of pocket for repairs or diagnostics. In addition, the delamination seems to be causing a leaking substance to drip down into other controls such as the Exhaust Brake, Trailer Brake Controls, and other physical buttons. It is my belief this is becoming a safety issue as the delamination is causing phantom key presses on various systems including setting volume of audio at 100% randomly.",

He has misdiagnosed two of my trucks and I believe he had something to do with a transmission going out in one.

SITUATION: In response to NHTSA safety recall number 21V-398, I messaged RAM on 25 July. I requested an expedited replacement of my unsafe vehicle with an identical or similar vehicle; or that they refund the vehicle's purchase price in full, minus a reasonable allowance for depreciation.  BACKGROUND: As a 100% disabled, medically retired Afghanistan war veteran, I heavily rely on owning a safe, reliable vehicle to travel to medical appointments. Additionally, my vehicle is used to pick up and drop off family to/from elementary school. This recalled vehicle is my sole source of transportation. As such, I am deeply concerned about my vehicle's safety issue, which includes the risk of a wheel separating from the vehicle during operation, causing a vehicle crash without prior warning, and/or the wheel/tire posing a risk to other motorists.  ASSESSMENT: To allow reasonable time for RAM/Mopar to provide an available remedy, I waited two months before making my request. However, as a company that regards the safety of its customers as paramount, I asked RAM to appreciate the seriousness and urgency of my request and that they acknowledge their duty to resolve this matter in a timely manner. Furthermore, I explained that I believe that a prudent company could foresee that a breach of this duty may proximately cause severe injury or death.  On 26 July, a RAM Customer Service Call Center rep advised me that an available remedy is not expected for at least four months and that in light of unprecedented parts/supply shortages caused by COVID-19, it is reasonable for Mopar to anticipate unforeseeable delays in having a repair solution within four months, or even within one year. Nevertheless, the rep stated that my request would not be honored and my case would not be elevated for further consideration.  I appreciate any assistance that NHTSA can provide to resolve this matter.",

I FOUND THAT 6 OUT OF 8 LUGS SHEARED OFF THE PASSENGER SIDE DUALLY, LEAVING TWO LUGS HOLDING THE DUALLY WHEELS ON. THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME AND FEEL A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. IF I DID NOT PULL OVER THE WHEELS WOULD HAVE FALLEN OFF AND A CATASTROPHIC CRASH WOULD HAVE OCCURED. I WOULD LIKE THE LUGS  EXAMINED BY A FORENSIC EXAMINER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHY THIS EVENT HAPPENED AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT A REOCCURANCE.
