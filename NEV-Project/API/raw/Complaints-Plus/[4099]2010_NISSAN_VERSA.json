Replacement as part of recall warning light complaint and case filed. Air bag warning light came on 12/19/21, diagnostic 12/21/21 air bag control system needed replacement. Clock spring was replaced October 2019, 15 months after recall issues on Takata air bag system and full replacement completed 7/26/2018. Nissan cannot cover costs due to mileage on car. I noted wanting to have this on record that these issues began after the recall on air bags and replacement in 2018. 615-725-7000 12/31/21 car air bag issue repaired then air bag light would pop on 2 more times, once in January 2022 in which they said they forgot to \u2018clear codes\u201d and then in February 2022 when other issues surfaced, another part replaced. Then light pops on again 3/15/2022 and I notified the service advisor with Nissan who\u2019d been helping me and took the car in the following week.I have already paid for repairs to the clock spring in October 2019 between $530-$600 and the repair done 12/31/21 totaling over $1000 which includes the diagnostic fee, parts and labor. $1600 is just the bare minimum of what's been paid out.3/30/2022: Nissan Versa 2010 was dropped off again at Nissan of Rivergate/Hayes Nissan due to air bag warning light coming on again. They are running another diagnostic. This has been a continual and consistent issue since the air bag recall and replacement in July 2018. I have paid for the clock spring to be replaced October 2019 and now other parts and many trips to this Nissan for a \u201cfix.\u201d Which now they are saying I may have to possibly pay again. This is unacceptable and seems that there may be other consumers dealing with this issue. Something is wrong with this recall and replacement causing these issues of safety.",

FINALLY THEY COULD NOT AGREE TO PAY FOR A RENTAL SAID \"NEVER MIND.\" I WAS APPALLED AT THE DELAY, THE GAMES THEY PLAYED, THEN THE FINAL DECISION TO NOT SUPPLY A RENTAL AFTER THEY PROMISED THEY WOULD. I FEEL THIS WAS A TACTIC TO DELAY THINGS UNTIL THEY GOT THE PARTS \"AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER\". YET HERE WE ARE IN NOVEMBER WITH NO FIX IN SIGHT. THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A HARDSHIP DUE TO OUR CARPOOL SITUATION. I ALSO THINK IT IS REDICULOUS THAT THE INFO ABOUT \"DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY\" WAS NOT IN BOLD PRINT ON THE CARD, LIKE OTHER INFO WAS. WHEN I MENTIONED THIS TO THE NISSAN REP (SUMMER WAS HER NAME), SHE SAID \"THE CARD SAYS WHAT?\" SHE HAD NO CLUE OF WHAT THE RECALL CARD STATED. NISSAN'S HELP, OR LACK THERE OF,  WAS LAUGHABLE.

WHEN I LOOKED AT THE WHEEL WELL, I COULD SEE THE BROKEN SPRING.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE.  THE PASSENGER SIDE SPRING WAS ALSO DAMAGED:  LARGE CHUNKS OF THE SPRING HAD BROKEN OFF, BUT THE SPRING HAD NOT BROKEN THROUGH YET.  I ONLY HAVE 25,835 MILES ON THE CAR.  I FOLLOW THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE AT THE NISSAN DEALER.  I AM SO THANKFUL THAT THIS HAPPENED ON THE DRIVEWAY AND THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED.  *TR",

HE EXPLAINED THAT SOMETIMES WITH VEHICLES YOU GET LUCKY (MY LAST VEHICLE, A CHEVY, LASTED OVER 10 YEARS....PROBABLY WOULD STILL BE RUNNING IF I HAD NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT) BUT IN THIS SITUATION I JUST DIDN'T LUCK OUT.  I ASKED HOW LONG THE VEHICLE WOULD CONTINUE TO RUN.  HE SAID HE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION; HE COULDN'T PREDICT THE LIFE LEFT IN MY VEHICLE.

THE FIRST TIME, I DROVE THIS CAR, I SUFFERED THE FIRST ACCIDENT OF MY LIFE...AND I PRAY TO GOD THAT NOONE EVER EXPERIENCES THAT KIND OF AN IMBALANCING. BASICALLY THE CAR TOTALLY LOST CONTROL & I COULD DO NOTHING TO STABILIZE THE CAR. THAT HAPPENED IN DELAWARE. YESTERDAY, APRIL 30, I WAS DRIVING IT ON INDIANA DUNES HIGHWAY & I-94, CHICAGO, PERHAPS IT WAS THE WIND, BUT IT ONLY MADE THE SHAKING MUCH WORSE. I HAD A FRIEND DRIVE IT AND HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE. DRIVING THIS CAR IS LIKE RIDING ON A ROLLER COASTER RIDE, BUT I WAS THE ONE BEHIND THE WHEELS.    IF I HAD THE MONEY, I WOULD DEFINITELY GO AHEAD AND SUE NISSAN FOR EVEN RELEASING THIS VEHICLE OUT FOR ROADS. DRIVING A NISSAN VERSA IS LIKE KAYAKING THROUGH THE MIRAGE OF GORGES.....YOU HAVE TO BE ATTENTIVE ALL THE TIME, IT TENDS TO SLIP TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WONT STAY IN ONE LANE. IT IS LIKE TRYING TO KEEP YOUR BOAT/ TUBE IN ONE STRAIGHT POSITION WHILE THE BOAT KEEPS FLYING AWAY...EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT.     I SWEAR IF I HAD SUFFERED ANOTHER ACCIDENT YESTERDAY, I WOULD HAVE SUED NISSAN BLINDLY, WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.  AND I AM SURPRISED HOW COME NOONE HAS SUED THEM YET FOR SELLING A PLASTIC TOY FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS!!!  *TR",
