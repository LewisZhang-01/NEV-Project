We used the dealership for every scheduled maintenance and maintained updated contact information the whole time. On August 6, 2021 when we were approximately 100 miles from home our car stalled abruptly in the middle of an intersection. The car was not driveable so we called a tow truck and we\u2019re able to obtain a rental car. The car was towed to the nearest dealership which informed us the problem was due to a recalled faulty fuel pump. ( The first we had ever heard of the recall) The dealership fixed the car free of charge but denied us twice when we asked for approximately $450. 00 in reimbursement charges for the tow truck and car rental.  We finally received a notice concerning the very long ongoing recall on or about September 2, 2021. We feel Toyota possibly knew about the dangerous recall when they sold us the car in July 2019. Thankfully it happened just as we were leaving a red light and no one was coming through the intersection, so no crash occurred",

THE TRANSMISSION IMMEDIATELY HAD SHIFTING ISSUES AS IT COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT FORWARD GEAR TO GO INTO AND SHIFTED HARD AND FELT AS IF IT WAS GOING INTO TWO GEARS AT ONE TIME AND AFTER A SHORT DRIVE THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER WARNING DISPLAY INDICATED A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND WARNING THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS OVERHEATING AND ACTED AS IF THE ENGINE WAS STARVING OF FUEL AS IT SURGED AND DID NOT DELIVER POWER TO GO BEYOND 35 MPH.  AFTER I BOUGHT IT THE DEALER REASSURED ME AT LEAST THREE TIMES THAT THE CAR WAS OKAY AND THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS.   I REPEATEDLY HAD THE DEALER CHECK IT AND THE DEALER REASSURED ME THAT THERE WAS NO TROUBLE CODE AND NO PROBLEMS FOUND ALTHOUGH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER SHOWED TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING AND THEY FIXED A WIRING CONNECTOR TO TRY AND FIX THE RUNNING PROBLEM.  A CLASS ACTION SUIT CAME OUT FOR THE FUEL PUMP FAILURE RECALL AND THE 8 SPEED TRANSMISSION.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURE ARE TRYING TO HIDE.   AFTER 13 MONTHS AND 2,800 TOTAL MILES THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATED, BURNED UP THE INTERNAL CLUTCH SET AND I NOW HAVE NO FORWARD AND REVERSE GEARS.  I FEEL THAT THE SURGING AND TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS ARE A SOFTWARE DEFECT AS THE SHIFTING DEFECT COMES AND GOES AND VASTLY PROMOTED IF I DRIVE IT VERY GENTLY FROM A COLD START.  ONCE WARMED UP IT DOES NOT ACT UP AS OFTEN EXCEPT WHEN TWO GEARS SEEM TO BE ENGAGED AT THE SAME TIME.    THE KEY ALSO INTERMITTENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW THE CAR TO START AND INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ALSO SHOWS TRAC LIGHT , ABS FAILURE LIGHT, BSM NOT AVAILABLE, SMART KEY FAILURE, AND COMPLETE BLACK OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND SHOWN TO THE DEALER MECHANIC AND SERVICE WRITERS AND PHOTOGRAPHED AND VIDEOTAPED FOR DOCUMENTATION AND IN THE REPAIR ORDERS.",

TOYOTA WAS SEND TO SERVICE MANY TIMES AFTER TO MULTIPLE TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY DIAGNOSIS. AT 15K MILES ON THE CAR DRIVING ON HIGHWAY (70MPH) THE HIGHLANDER LOST POWER AND STARTED LOUD NOISE. WHEN PULLED OVER FOUND OIL SMELL AND SMOKE FROM ENGINE. DURING EXAMINATION FOUND 3 CYLINDER WENT LOOSE. DURING THAT TIME ONE OF THEM CAME OFF THE SIDE AND HIT THE TRANSMISSION. ALMOST A FULL MONTH THE HIGHLANDER WAS REBUILT BUT NO FINAL WORD WHAT HAD HAPPENED BY TOYOTA CORP. THE CAR IS ABOUT 17K MILES AND STARTED TO ACT THE SAME WAY. AS A FAMILY WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR ESPECIALLY MY PREGNANT WIFE WITH CHILDREN. I AM AFRAID THIS MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AND CAN LOCK UP ALL WHEELS AND CAN RESULT IN MASSIVE ACCIDENT. TOYOTA IS NOT TAKING THIS AS SERIOUS AND SEEMS TO ME THEY DO NOT CARE. AS OF RIGHT NOW THE HIGHLANDER HAS PROBLEMS WITH ALIGNMENT, LANE ASSIST, AND LACK OF POWER. PLEASE SEE PICTURES.  *TR",
