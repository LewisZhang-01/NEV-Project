I WAS INFORMED THAT A RECALL REPAIR FOR THE TRANSMISSION/POWER-TRAIN  (04V176000) AND TIMING BELT (02V226000) WERE MADE TO MY VEHICLE HOWEVER I AM STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM INCLUDING EXCESSIVE VIBRATION & HESITATION DURING ACCELERATION ESPECIALLY BETWEEN 50-60MPH), CRUISE CONTROL HAS SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING/NOTICE WHILE DRIVING , AND INABILITY TO PASS NC EMISSIONS INSPECTIONS. I CONTACTED THE NHTSA AND WAS INFORMED WITH 2 DIFFERENT REASONS WHY MY VEHICLE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REPAIR. (1) VEHICLE BATCH NUMBER WAS NOT AFFECTED AND THEN (2) THE REPAIR HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE IN FEB 2005 BY PREVIOUS OWNER.     ALL THESE PROBLEM STARTED OCCURRING AFTER I TOOK MY CAR TO LEITH ACURA OF CARY, NC FOR THE RECALL ON THE TARKATA AIRBAGS(15V320000). I HAVE BEEN DENIED SAFETY REPAIRS TO MY VEHICLE. LEITH ACURA OF CARY, NC IS REQUIRING ME TO PAY $131.00 INORDER TO DO A DIAGNOSTIC SCAN ONLY THAT I ALREADY HAVE PROOF FROM SEVERAL ASE CERTIFIED INSPECTION STATIONS (WHICH WERE FREE OF CHARGE). I DOES NOT INCLUDE THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO FIX THE PROBLEM PENDING IT IS NOT TOTALLY A RECALL REPAIR. I BELIEVE THAT THE REPAIR WAS DONE INCORRECTLY OR THE CURRENT TRANSMISSION IS NOT THE ONE THAT REPLACED THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION AFTER THE RECALL REPAIR. IF SO, I SHOULD BE ALLOWED REPAIRS.",

HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO DIE? SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND AN INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE OPENED. ACURA AND HONDA ARE NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT, EVEN WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN OPEN CAMPAIGN. EXTENDING THE WARRANTY DOES NOTHING FOR A CAR THAT IS ONLY DRIVEN A FEW MILES TO WORK DAILY. I HAVE JUST OVER 80,000 MILES ON MY 2003 TL. I GUESS IT IS SHAME ON ME FOR NOT DRIVING 15K MILES A YEAR. HAD I BEEN DRIVING THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE SEIZED UP MANY YEARS AGO AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. WHAT A SCAM. THANKS FOR NOTHING HONDA/ACURA.  *TR",

THIS MODEL AS WELL AS OTHER ACURA MODEL VEHICLES, ETC, HAD A PREVIOUS RECALL ON THE TRANSMISSION (2004).  I ALSO PREVIOUSLY HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED (26 AUG 2004) TO ACURA BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION FAILED WHILE DRIVING AND THE CAR BROKE DOWN.

ACURA TAKEN TO LEITH ACURA, CARY, NC ON 4/14/10.  DEALER SERVICE DEPT IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING COMPUTER CODES:   P0740-TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH, P0730-GEAR INCORRECT RATIO, & P0700-SHIFT MALFUNCTION.  BASED ON THESE CODES, DEALER RECOMMENDED TRANSMISSION & TORQUE CONVERTER TO BE REPLACED (TOTAL COST APPROX $ 3400).  DEALER CONTACTED THE REGIONAL ACURA OFFICE, WHICH PROVIDED A 45% ADJUSTMENT TO THE ORIGINAL COST.  NET CHARGE BY DEALER $ 1,783.19.    THIS VEHICLE WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL IN 2003-04 (NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID # 04V176000).  THE MODIFICATION TO THIS SAFETY RECALL WAS COMPLETED ON 9/10/2004 BY TISCHER ACURA, LAUREL, MD WITH MILEAGE @ 8,426.  PER THE INVOICE FROM TISCHER & SINCE THE MILEAGE WAS LESS THAN 15,000, THE RECALL INSTRUCTED THE DEALER TO \"INSTALL AN OIL JET KIT\", WHICH WAS COMPLETED.  NOTE, IF THE VEHICLE HAD MORE THAN 15,000 MILES, THE SAFETY RECALL INSTRUCTED THE DEALER TO \"REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION\".      BASED UPON THE HISTORY OF THIS PARTICULAR ACURA, I BELIEVE THE DEALER IN 2004 SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION INSTEAD OF INSTALLING AN OIL JET KIT.  MANY ACURAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO THE 2004 MODEL HAD SERIOUS \"TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS\" WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER \"RECALLS\".  *TR",

BUT I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AS WAS LISTED (I.E. SLIPPING OF GEARS, SUDDEN HARSH DOWNSHIFT FROM 65MPH TO REDLINE LIMIT AT 50MPH ON FREEWAY NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT). AFTER THE INCIDENT I HAD TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THERE HAD BEEN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE TO 109,000 MILES. I WAS AT NEARLY 108,000 MILES WHEN MY CAR WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP. THAT WAS WHEN THE SERVICE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT $3800 BECAUSE I HAD BEEN AFTER THE CUT-OFF POINT FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. THAT SERVICE WAS DENIED AND THEY SENT ME ON MY WAY EVEN THOUGH I WAS HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AS THE VEHICLES THAT WERE BEFORE THE VIN # CUT-OFF. I HAVE SINCE, THEN, REPLACED MY TRANSMISSION WITH ANOTHER SHOP FOR $3500 BUT ONLY AFTER LOSING MY JOB AND FAILING MY COLLEGE CLASSES FOR THE SEMESTER BECAUSE I COULD NOT AFFORD TO REPAIR MY CAR AT THE TIME. I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HOLD THE ACURA CORPORATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISTAKE AND FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERY OTHER DRIVER ON THE ROAD. IF YOU LOOK ON ACURAZINE.COM, THERE IS A TRANSMISSION (TRANNY) FAILURE THREAD THAT GOES ON FOR 64 PAGES WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME VEHICLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND NOT RECEIVING HELP FROM ACURA JUST LIKE ME. I KNOW THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAW-SUIT IN 2006 FOR THIS ISSUE AND I FEEL THERE WILL BE ANOTHER LAW-SUIT AGAINST THEM IF THIS PROBLEM IS NOT TREATED CORRECTLY. I ALSO KNOW THAT ACURA/HONDA MANUFACTURES THEIR OWN TRANSMISSIONS, UNLIKE A LOT IF NOT ALL OF THE OTHER CAR MAKERS WHOM USE UNIVERSAL TRANSMISSIONS.

THEY REPRESENTED THIS CAR AS BEING IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. WE PAID $10,270. CASH FOR THIS VEHICLE. NOT EVEN 5 WEEKS AFTER THE PURCHASE, THE TRANSMISSION WENT ON THE CAR. WHEN APPROACHED TO LOOK INTO THE NECESSARY REPAIRS TO THE CAR, THEY VEHEMENTLY DENIED ANY WRONG DOING AND REFUSED TO EVEN LOOK AT THE CAR. THEY WOULD ONLY HONOR NEW JERSEYS 30 DAY WARRANTY THAT THEY MUST DO ANYWAY. THEY NEVER MENTIONED ANY TROUBLE WITH THE TRANS NOR THE FACT THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT PRIOR TO US PURCHASING THE CAR AND FRONT FENDER, DOOR, ETC HAS BEEN REPLACED.  IT HAS NOW BEEN 4 WEEKS THAT THE CAR HAS BEEN IN A TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP AS HONDA/ACURA KEEPS SENDING THE SHOP THE WRONG PARTS TO FIX THE PROBLEMS (CLUTCH PACK FAILURE, 2ND GEAR SHAFT LOCKING UP, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY HAVE TO REPAIR)  SINCE THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE FOR THE SAME TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, IS THE CAR STILL COVERED? I DON'T KNOW IF THE CAR WAS REPAIRED WHEN THE RECALL WAS FIRST INITIATED, AND EVEN IF IT WAS, IT IS NOW A RECURRING PROBLEM. IT TOOK ALL THE MONEY WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE, NOW WE HAVE HAD TO RENT A CAR FOR 3-4 WEEKS WHILE THE CAR IS BEING REPAIRED, AND IT IS SUPPOSED TO COST ANYWHERE FROM $2500-$3500 TO REPAIR.   IS THERE ANY WAY THAT HONDA/ACURA OF AMERICA CAN HELP WITH THE COST OF THE REPAIRS/REPLACEMENT SINCE THIS WAS A NHTSA RECALL THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT FIXED PROPERLY IN THE FIRST PLACE, IF AT ALL. I FEEL THE DEALER KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM, BUT BEING A MOTHER/DAUGHTER BUYER, WAS JUST INTERESTED IN THE SALE. NOT HONESTY. PLEASE,  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP DEFRAY THE COSTS WE ARE NOW FACED WITH? ANY HELP YOUR CORPORATION CAN GIVE AT THIS POINT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP AS I FEEL THE HUGE EXPENSE TO REPAIR THIS CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE PAID BY US.  THANK YOU  *TR",

ONCE ON THE ROAD AGAIN I PROCEEDED ABOUT 3 MILES WHEN THE CAR WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN ANY GEAR AT ALL. I WAS RIGHT IN FRONT IF THE HONDA STORE WHEN THE SECOND FAILURE HAPPENED. I HAD THE DIAGNOSTIC DONE AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT I AM IN NEED OF A NEW TRANSMISSION AND MOTOR MOUNT DUE TO OVER HEATING (FROM THE SERVICE TECH). MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL ACURA DEALERSHIP THAT NOTIFIED ME THAT I DID INFACT NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND MOTOR MOUNT AT A COST OF APPROX. $3500.00. THIS I NOW FIND IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ACURA WITH THIS MODEL YEAR AND THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS.

UPON INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE, THE ACURA MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SEEN PREVIOUSLY ON SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES OF THE SAME MAKE/MODEL AND THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (VSA) ALLOWING SLIPPAGE OF THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE DURING RIGHT TURNS.  ACURA STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RESOLUTION AVAILABLE AND THE ONLY RECOURSE WAS TO ROTATE THE TIRES ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS.  TIRE DEALER WAS ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE TIRE ITSELF (MICHELIN) AND INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO SERVICE NOTIFICATIONS ISSUES FROM THE MANUFACTURER.      THE WEAR ON THIS TIRE IS HEAVILY ACCELERATED AND WAS ONLY NOTICED ON A ROUTINE EXAMINATION OF THE VEHICLE.  BASED ON THE STATEMENTS BY THE ACURA MECHANIC, I BELIEVE THERE TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE TO SLIP, THEREBY CAUSING THE EXCESSIVE WEAR.  GIVEN WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS, THIS SLIPPAGE WAS INCREASED DUE TO THE LOSS OF ROAD TRACTION.  IF UNNOTICED, THE TIRE WOULD HAVE FAILED (WITH LESS THAN 28000 MILES) POTENTIALLY CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.      THE WORN TIRE IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION AND PICTURES OF THE TIRE IN COMPARISON TO THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT TIRE ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  *NM",
