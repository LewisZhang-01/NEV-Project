NHTSA ID NUMBER:10135147    SPECIAL COVERAGE EXTENDS TO 2013 SILVERADO 3500 MODEL, BUT NOT 2013 SILVERADO 2500 PER THE DEALER. I OWN THE 2500 WHICH IS CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM OBD ERROR CODE P20B9. SAME CODE APPLIES TO 3500 FROM WHAT I'VE READ. THIS ERROR OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I WAS NOTIFIED BY THE DASH THAT I HAD 100 MILES BEFORE LIMITED POWER AND SPEED WOULD BE APPLIED. FORTUNATELY I WAS 40 MILES FROM HOME.     BOTH TRUCKS ARE THE SAME OTHER THAN THE 3500 HAS DUAL WHEELS (\"DULLY\") AND LARGER REAR AXELS FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALER. OTHER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE  DIESEL-EMISSION-REDUCTION FLUID SYSTEM (DEF). BOTH MODELS APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME SYSTEM INCLUDING THE TANK RESERVOIR AND COMPONENTS. IN FACT WHEN YOU ORDER REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR THIS ISSUE, INCREASED DEF TANK-HEATER RESISTANCE, THE PART BEING REPLACED IS THE SAME BE IT A 3500 OR 2500.     CURIOUS WHY THE 3500 MODEL IS COVERED UNDER THE SPECIAL COVERAGE AND THE 2500 IS NOT?     WHY 2013 2500 NOT ON LIST OF (14) PRODUCTS, IF IT'S THE SAME AS 2013 3500 WHEN BOTH MODELS:  -GET THE SAME OBD CODE: P20B9  - REPLACEMENT PART (23379348) FOR 2500 PER DEALER IS FOUND ON THE NHTSA'S SPECIAL COVERAGE LIST  - REPLACEMENT PART PER DEALER (23379348) IS THE SAME FOR 3500 AND 2500 PER GM SITE AND ROCKAUTO.COM    THANK YOU IN ADVANCE, FIDEL",

THIS MACHINE IS OPERATED IN THE MOUNTAINS OFTEN. THE 2 NEAR MISSES WERE AS DESCRIBED HERE. 1ST: I WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN WITH A HIGHWAY CROSS ROAD. CROSS TRAFFIC DID NOT HAVE TO STOP. WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO STOP AND I HEARD A TONE ACTIVATE THEN THE DIC INDICATED ABS NEEDS SERVICE, STABLI-TRAK NEEDS SERVICE, SERVICE THE TRAILER BRAKE SYSTEM. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS COMING BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MY TRAILER BRAKES WERE TURNED OFF BY THE TRUCK ON A FULLY LOADED TRAILER. I COULD NOT STOP AT THIS INTERSECTION. 2ND: I WAS TRAVELING DOWN A SLIGHT INCLINE TOWARDS A RED STOPLIGHT. I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND RECEIVED THE SAME WARNINGS AND THE TRUCK TURNED OFF THE TRAILER BRAKES ON A FULLY LOADED TRAILER AGAIN. THIS TIME I HAD A SEMI TRUCK COMING FROM THE RIGHT.

ONE PHONE CALL I GOT FROM GM , STATED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATED STATED ABOVE WAS FAR LOW. WHEN I ASKED HOW MUCH, STATED TO ME COULD NOT SAY HOWEVER MUCH HIGHER.

ON 16 MAY, 2015, I CALLED MARINE CHEVROLET'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT A 1 1/2\"CRACK ABOVE THE CENTER OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG. MY TRUCK HAD 37,017 MILES AND WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE ORIGINAL FACTORY WARRANTY. HOWEVER, I WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS WAS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL. THE DEALERSHIP SCHEDULE A SERVICE APPOINTMENT FOR 8:30 AM ON 18 MAY, 2015. AFTER CONDUCTING RESEARCH OVER THE WEEKEND, I LEARNED THAT OTHER CHEVY AND GMC OWNERS OF TRUCK AND SUV MODELS BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013 REPORTED CRACKED DASHES NEAR THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS. ON 18 MAY, I BROUGHT MY TRUCK TO MARINE CHEVROLET'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE THE CRACK. THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE INITIALLY TOLD ME THAT SINCE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, CHEVROLET WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS. I EXPLAINED THAT THE CRACK HAPPENED LESS THAN THREE YEARS AFTER I PURCHASED THE TRUCK AND I WAS AWARE OF THE HISTORY OF THESE DASHBOARDS. THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TALKED TO HIS SERVICE MANAGER AND LATER TOLD ME THAT GM WOULD PAY THE MAJORITY OF THE MAINTENANCE COST AND THAT I WOULD ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR $100. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ONLINE COMPLAINTS I HAVE SEEN IN FORUMS AND ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES, I FEEL GM MAY HAVE INSTALLED DEFECTIVE DASHBOARDS IN 2007 - 2013 TRUCK AND SUV MODELS AND PASSED THE COST OF DEFECTIVE PARTS ONTO THE CUSTOMER. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYS WITH A CRACK DASHBOARD SURROUNDING IT, THERE COULD AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF DASHBOARD SHRAPNEL FLYING INTO A PASSENGER'S FACE. I THINK NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE CRACKING DASHBOARD ISSUE IN GM'S SUVS AND PICK-UP TRUCKS FROM 2007 - 2013 AND INFLUENCE GM TO ISSUE A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.",

JUNE, 2013 - A TROPICAL STORM SWEPT THROUGH THE AREA, DUMPING TONS OF RAIN; CAUSING THE HUMIDITY TO RISE A FEW HOURS LATER AS WELL AS CAUSING EVERYTHING TO BE MOIST/WET.  BOTH EVENTS WERE EITHER IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OR IN THE EVENING AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN, AND INVOLVE WETNESS/MOISTURE, HUMIDITY, AND THE INABILITY TO \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD.  PROBLEM:  THERE IS A \"CONDENSATION FILM\" THAT FORMS ON THE WINDSHIELD DUE TO THE OUTSIDE ELEMENTS BEING MORE MOIST AND HUMID THAN THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  USUALLY, WHEN TURNING ON THE DEFROSTER, THIS WILL \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD AND MAKE THE CONDENSATION FILM GO AWAY.  HOWEVER, THE DEFROSTER ON THIS MODEL DOES NOT \"DRY\" THE WINDSHIELD ON THE RIGHT SIDE (PASSENGER) OF THE VEHICLE.  THE AIR COMING OUT OF THE DEFROSTER ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS NOT AS STRONG AS THE LEFT. THERE IS A CONSTANT  CONDENSATION FILM THAT FORMS AND REMAINS.  THE WIPERS WILL CLEAR THE WETNESS/MOISTURE AWAY, TEMPORARILY, BUT THE FILM REMAINS AND THE MOISTURE/WETNESS RETURNS.  THIS MAKES THE VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRUCK NON-EXISTENT, AND WHEN TURNING A RIGHT HAND CORNER, OR ENTERING AN INTERSECTION, YOU CAN NOT SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.
