Why not?  See below: a) As the brake components (brake pads) were assumed to be wear items and not covered under warranty, the brake components were replaced (brake rotors and pads) and the calipers were rebuilt.  c) The brake service work was performed by the owner of the vehicle (complaint writer).  There were no lamps/icons nor messages displayed to alert the vehicle owner of the malfunction.  On June 05, 2021 while driving in the Traverse City MI area descending steep hills, it was noticed that the brake pedal required above normal force to slow the vehicle.   In July 2021 with approximately 21000 miles, I disassembled the front and rear brake components to investigate the root cause of the brake performance decline. The front and rear calipers were observed to have very minimal caliper lubricant on the caliper pins and sleeves and evidence of corrosion.  The front brake pads were worn approximately 50% and rear pads were worn about 90-100% (no friction material remaining).  See attached files. New brake rotors and pads were installed and the calipers were rebuilt.  On August 04 2021, I contacted the Mazda Customer Experience Center to advise of the brake system malfunction.  Service Request Number 1-4195762982 was assigned. On August 26 2021, I brought the brake pads and rotors to Serra Mazda to advise/alert Mazda of the premature brake pad wear.  The Service/Parts Director was given the brake pads in order that the components could be forwarded to Mazda for a \"PQR\" to be initiated.  No response has been received. The vehicle has been serviced at Serra Mazda since 2018 and no statements were made to the vehicle owner that the brake pads were below the service limit.",

THIS LANGUAGE AND RESPONSE IS IN LOCK-STEP WITH SEVERAL ONLINE FORUMS THAT I HAVE VIEWED REGARDING THIS ISSUE, WHICH APPEARS TO BE QUITE WIDESPREAD.  MANY OF THEM REPORTED THAT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIPS IN QUESTION WAS TO BLAME EXTERNAL FACTORS, VERY COMMONLY ROCKS.
