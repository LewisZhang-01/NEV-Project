        "summary": "I bought my 2018 Kia Soul from Fredy Kia Dealership in Houston, TX and after 3 years and 124K miles the engine failed. It started with the check light for 'engine knock sensor' code 1326. I had the sensor replaced but the mechanics mentioned that my oil was extremally low and needed oil. I just had my oil replaced by Archer Kia dealership 2 month prior how could that be? So they replace the oil and the sensor. I drove it for 4 hours and the check engine light came on again this time there is a knocking sound. The mechanics say its a blown piston and now the engine has to be replaced. This is incredibly sad and frustrating to know that these cars' engine fail after 100K and have to replace the engine. After researching on on this site and https://www.aboutautomobile.com/, this engine problem has been going on since 2012. How can this be? Why isn't Kia doing something to cover and fix this issue?",

The software update was installed on 4 December 2021.  The 16 November letter noted that if KSDS detected a problem, the car would enter a limp home mode that limited engine RPMs to 1800-2000 RPM and the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (\"check engine light\") would blink continuously.  On 17 December 2021, the check engine light started to blink continuously, and the engine RPMs never exceeded 2000 RPM.  I took the car to the dealership on 18 December 2021.  The car is not safely operable.  The dealership told me that they needed technical assistance from the factory, which they have not yet received as of 3 January 2022.  I'm reporting the issue because it appears to be related to the known engine manufacturing defects in Theta, Nu, and Gamma lines of engines, and that these issues persist beyond the 2011-2016 model years (for which a recall has already issued) and at least into the 2018 model year.  Answers to questions: (1) powertrain/engine failure, possibly other system(s) (2) safety risk is known fire danger in Theta, Nu, and Gamma engines (3) dealer is currently diagnosing/confirming the issue (as of 1/3/22) (4) only dealer has inspected vehicle (as of 1/3/22) (5) no issues prior to 12/17/21, when Malfunction Indicator Lamp (\"check engine light\") started to blink continuously and engine RPMs were limited to 2000 RPM.",

Suddenly there was a loud noise under the hood and the vehicle stopped dead in the middle of the road. Thank GOD we were not hit from behind. I put the flashers on to warn others. Other cars were blowing there horns, it was very dangerous for us and others as well. I called and got AAA there as soon as possible. The car was smoking and oil was every where. I had the car taken to an independent shop. They told me the connecting rod had gone through the engine block and that it was very bad. They suggested that I take it to the Kia dealership. They said Kia would know about the warranty's. I had AAA take it to the Kia dealer ship in west Orlando. I paid them 265.00 to do the diagnostics on the car. They told me the connecting rod bearing had caused the rod to go thru the engine block. They said I would Have to have a new engine (approx. 10,000.00 ). I said if I gave them the money when could i get my car? They said they didn't know. I ask if I could have a loaner vehicle to get myself to work. They said they don't do that. They also said at that cost I would not get a new engine. I was not treated very nice. I never had any trouble with my car. I had no warning of any kind it just suddenly stopped. I am a widow and my husband always told me to keep my oil changed. He said it is the life of the car. So I  always changed my oil ahead of the scheduled time for it to be changed. I got my oil changed on 7/29/2021 and the bearing went bad on 7/31/2021. A friend from my church tried to contact Kia Corp. in California for assistance,but was treated rudely.I know there have been recalls on different Kia and Hundai engines for connecting rod Bearing issues.This was very dangerous many people could have been hurt or killed. Kia Will not help. I only have 71,000 miles on my car. I was the second owner of the car so my warranty is no good. 3 tech's have seen it.",

Test Done, with a \"sorry\" we have to do the test again but we replaced the ignition coil. (2nd Coil since I\u2019ve owned car)  And again we test. With more \"Sorry\" it didn't burn enough oil, or you have to come in EXACTLY at 1,000 miles. (This is NOT true; math can be converted at any mileage over the 1,000.) Even when I told them it starts burning at the 2,000 mark after oil change. Over and over again, I miss work to sit in the dealership, or WALK home, as the dealership insisted on these appointments but wouldn't give me a loaner (I have full coverage insurance)  Finally in March 2021 they decide they will clean the combustion chamber. Need to leave car: they make me RENT a car saying it will be paid for with my warranty. ADDITIONAL days needed as more problems occurred while in for repair. (Oil switch). Keep the rental they told me, it\u2019s covered. Return the rental and the dealership won\u2019t PAY THE RENTAL. I have now missed over 30 hours of work, repeated oil change costs for the process, Rental Fees, Inspection fees that were never reimbursed.
