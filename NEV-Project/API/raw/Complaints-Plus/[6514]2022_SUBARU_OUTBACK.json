Without provocation by the impact of any stone or road bump or other apparent cause, the crack abruptly originated under the lower moulding near the center bottom between driver and passenger side, while at a stop light on a residential street near our home.  The crack rapidly lengthened vertically about 4 inches then turned 90 degrees toward passenger side and proceeded to further rapidly lengthen by about a foot before diving vertically back down to the bottom moulding on the passenger side.  I called Subaru of America and was told it would likely be a watranty repair but that I needed to take the vehicle to my local Subaru dealer for inspection and documentation of the failure.  I took the vehicle immediately to the dealer where they took pictures and wrote up a fully detailed report for Subaru of America (SOA). Now it is 3 days later and I am still awaiting a call from SOA, and I am unable (unwilling actually) to drive the car because of my concern for my family\u2019s safety in case of the windshield failing additionally while driving.",

The crack is in my line of sight part of the time, is extremely noticeable, and at times is an obstruction of view. Also, if something were to actually impact the windshield, I wouldn\u2019t have much for protection but clearly the windshield was not much for protection to begin with. Dealership says it must\u2019ve been a chip but i had just washed my car including the windows and I notice everything and document everything since this is my first purchase of a brand new car. There was no visible chip. I don\u2019t go off-roading or anything of the sort. I 100% believe this is a defect that has been ongoing for Subaru. Dealer gave me a business card to a repair place. Contacted Subaru and they give me a $500 certificate to use towards a windshield replacement at a dealership BUT the dealership will not replace the windshield, most likely because this has been an ongoing issue with Subaru and if the new windshield is not installed by a Subaru dealer, it\u2019s not covered under warranty. So, essentially I got a useless gift certificate. There should have been some sort of disclosure or better yet, some accountability for the poor quality and safety hazard the windshield presents.",

        "summary": "Front windshield had to be replaced the same day it was driven off the lot. 2 weeks after replacement the windshield cracked again. Dealership and safe lite both claim it\u2019s not their problem. Insurance stated if I continue getting the windshield replaced after every break then they are going to keep raise my rates because of frequently claiming issues.  I paid almost $50,000 for this vehicle which requires 4hrs for replacement and programming because of the front facing cameras it requires for safe driving. 4 hrs \u2026IF \u2026no one else is already scheduled so I\u2019m recommended to leave the car over night but no loaner vehicles will be provided. The additional film required to protect the exterior of the windshield is 300% more expensive than the windshield itself. Now every month I have to replace my windshield due to breaking and the obligatory film I and up paying approximately  $500 per instance AND pay an insurance rate increase. How is this fair or legal? My car payment is already $750 per month. Monthly repairs for ONLY the windshield are equaling 80% of my already monthly expenses before any other costs. How is this fair or legal? Is there any open lawsuits I can join or any other options?",

I had no power steering or power brakes.  I was able to safely stop the vehicle with no incident other than damage to the plastic over the right rear taillight.  I turned the vehicle off and restarted it, and everything seemed operational.  It seemed that the car's engine had not turned on, only the electrical system.    The same issue happened repeatedly over the next few days.  In observing what was happening, I have noticed that the push button ignition requires a significant press in order for the vehicle to start correctly - quite different from my experience with our previous two push-button start vehicles.    In the \"Getting Started Guide, Outback 2022\", p. 41, instructions clearly state \"briefly press and release the Engine START/STOP button.\"  I submit that this is inaccurate, and that new vehicle owners should be advised as to what to do, and what to look for in the dashboard to understand that the vehicle engine has, in fact, started properly.    I am a user experience researcher, including in automotive research, and we have an expression that there's no such thing as user error, just poor design.  This is a clear example of poor design.",

Traffic was heavy, with southbound transient traffic traveling to New Jersey Shore points.

Vehicle was pulled to the right shoulder of the roadway and I began to smell something burning.  As I removed personal effects from vehicle I exited and saw smoke coming from the passenger's side wheel well.  I walked back approximately 100 feet and called 911, by time a dispatcher came answered, the engine compartment of the vehicle was completely engulfed in flames.    No modifications of any kind were done to the vehicle since its purchase.  I was the sole occupant of the vehicle and not injured.  The vehicle is fully insured and payments are current.
