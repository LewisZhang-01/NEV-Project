AFTER A FEW  MINUTES, I TRIED AGAIN, THIS TIME GIVING VEHICLE MORE GAS.  IT SEEMED TO DO A LITTLE BETTER.  BUT, EVERY TIME I HAD TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP FOR A STOP SIGN OR TRAFFIC LIGHT, VEHICLE WAS SPUTTERING AND ACTING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO STALL OUT.  WAS VERY NERVE RACKING, AS I WAS AFRAID OF BEING REAR ENDED BY CARS THAT WERE BEHIND ME.  NOW EVERY TIME I SLOW DOWN TO WHERE VEHICLE IS IN IDLE, IT ACTS LIKE IT IS GOING TO STALL OUT ON ME, WHICH MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS.  HAD A MECHANIC INSTALL NEW PLUGS, NEW INJECTOR, COIL PACKAGE AND VEHICLE IS STILL DOING BADLY AND RUNNING VERY ROUGH.  ENGINE LIGHT STILL COMES ON AFTER HAVING ALL THESE NEW PARTS INSTALLED.  MECHANIC ALSO RECOMMENDED USING A GAS ADDITIVE AND FILLING TANK WITH PREMIUM GAS, WHICH I DID.  STILL RUNNING ROUGH.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, HAVE FOUND OUT THAT FORD RANGERS, YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2006 ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 66,362 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE KEPT MAINTAINED AT ALL TIMES.  FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS BUT HAS NOT DONE A RECALL YET.  I FEEL THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES.  EITHER I WILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW ENGINE OR A NEW VEHICLE, WHICH I CAN NOT AFFORD.  FORD NEEDS TO RECALL AND PAY FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, AS THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR NEW ENGINE OR NEW VEHICLE, WHEN MY 2004 RANGER HAS LOW MILEAGE AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED THE WHOLE TIME THAT I HAVE HAD IT.  IT IS THE 3.0 VULCAN ENGINE.

THE AIR TEMPERATURE WAS VERY COLD (0 DEG. F) AT THE TIME, AND THE 4X4 SYSTEM ON THE VEHICLE WAS ENGAGED.  WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES AS I WAS PULLING INTO THE PARKING SPOT, THE BRAKE PEDAL HIT THE FLOOR SO THE VEHICLE DID NOT SLOW DOWN AND THERE WAS NO PULSING SENSATION FROM ABS.  AS A RESULT, MY VEHICLE COLLIDED WITH A PARKED VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF MY VEHICLE.  MY VEHICLE AND THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE BOTH DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THIS BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE.

THE FORD DEALER IN MY TOWN WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE FAILURE AND DID NOT FIND ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM.

ON JUNE 18, 2015, BERGLUND FORD OF BEDFORD, VIRGINIA REFUSED TO INSPECT MY VEHICLE TO DETERMINE IF AN IMPROPERLY MANUFACTURED FRAME PART EXISTS THAT COULD RUPTURE THE GASOLINE TANK DURING A SIDE IMPACT TYPE OF COLLISION.    1. A VISUAL INSPECTION IS THE ONLY METHOD TO DETERMINE IF THE RECALL HAZARD EXISTS.   2. FORD'S COMPUTER RECORDS CAN ONLY INDICATE IF AN INSPECTION HAS OCCURRED.      3. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE LOGICALLY IF THE RECALL HAZARD EXISTS BY USING VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS.   AT THE TIME OF MY REQUEST FOR AN INSPECTION, I WAS PREPARED TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED.  ALSO, WHEN I REQUESTED THE INSPECTION OF THE FRAME AND FUEL TANK, I BECAME AWARE OF AN AIR BAG RECALL THAT HAD BEEN RECENTLY PUBLISHED FOR MY MODEL OF LIGHT TRUCK.    BERGLUND FORD REFUSED TO ADDRESS EITHER RECALL SITUATION FOR ME BECAUSE, \"THE COMPUTER DID NOT CALL FOR IT.\"    I MAY OWN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS VEHICLE THAT COULD KILL THE OCCUPANTS DURING A COLLISION BECAUSE OF 2 FEDERAL SAFETY RECALL ISSUES THAT HAVE EXISTED SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED.

I HAVE ALSO CALLED FORD AND SPOKE WITH THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THEY OFFERED LITTLE HELP.  MY NEW TRUCK NOW SMELLS LIKE MOLD AND MILDEW, BUT THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO FIX THAT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THEIR FAULT, OR THE WINDOW PROBLEM OTHER THAN REPLACE IT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  I THINK THAT THE SEAT IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM.  NOT ONLY DOES IT PUSH THE GLASS OUT IT ALSO RESTRICTS THE REAR VIEW OF THE TRUCK WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE THE SEATS GO ALL THE WAY TO THE CEILING.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A ACCIDENT IF THE SEAT PUSHES OUT THE BACK WINDOW?   *NM",

THIS BEHAVIOR IS MOST OBVIOUS WHEN THE CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED WHILE CHANGING GEARS. THE ENGINE RPM IS HELD ARTIFICIALLY HIGH (WAY ABOVE NORMAL IDLE) FOR AS LONG AS I DEPRESS THE CLUTCH, UP UNTIL THE POINT THAT THE VEHICLE HAS COASTED ALMOST TO A COMPLETE STOP.  I BELIEVE THAT THE COMPUTER ALSO DOES THIS WHEN THE CLUTCH IS ENGAGED. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I REMOVE PRESSURE FROM THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO COAST WITH THE CLUTCH ENGAGED WHILE IN THIRD GEAR ON A LEVEL ROAD, THE VEHICLE NEVER SLOWS DOWN BELOW APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH (CORRESPONDING TO APPROXIMATELY 2000 ENGINE RPMS). ALSO, WHILE DESCENDING A HILL IN A LOW (2ND/3RD) GEAR USING ENGINE BRAKING (NOT TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL), I CAN FEEL THE TRUCK SPONTANEOUSLY ACCELERATE. I FIRST TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER FOR THIS COMPLAINT ON 10/22/04. THE TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THE BEHAVIOR, INSPECTED VARIOUS SENSORS, PROBED THE COMPUTER FOR ERROR CODES, AND EVENTUALLY RESORTED TO RESETTING THE COMPUTER IN HOPES THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR. THIS OF COURSE DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, SO I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 11/16/04 WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT. THEY RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND FOUND THAT IT IS A \"NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC\" OF THE VEHICLE, SUPPOSEDLY ADDED TO THE COMPUTER PROGRAM TO IMPROVE EMISSIONS. ASIDE FROM BEING ANNOYING, I BELIEVE THAT THIS \"FEATURE\" COULD POSE A SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PREDICTABILITY OF ENGINE BRAKING ON DOWN-HILL GRADES.

THE SERVICE PERSON EXPLAINED THAT THE TIRES WERE ONLY WARRANTEED FOR 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES.  *AK     ON APRIL 27TH , I ARRIVED EARLY AND SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, MR. JIM BASILOTTO. HE LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND AGREED THERE WAS AN ALIGNMENT PROBLEM.  I EXPLAINED THAT THE VEHICLE IS GARAGE KEPT AND IT IS ONLY DRIVEN BACK AND FORTH TO WORK ON THE LOCAL ROADS. THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN OFF- ROAD OR EVEN ON BAD ROADS AND NEVER TRAVELED FARTHER THAN PORT CHARLOTTE, FL. SHE OR I CAN NOT EVER REMEMBER HITTING A POTHOLE THAT WOULD COME CLOSE TO CAUSING  A PROBLEM.     THE SERVICE PEOPLE PUT THE CAR ON THE LIFT AND CHECKED THE TIE RODS BY TRYING TO WIGGLE THEM WHILE THE VEHICLE HAD ITS FULL WEIGHT ON THE TIRES. ( I PERSONALLY CHECK FRONT END PARTS BY RAISING THE WHEELS OFF THE GROUND AND CHECK FOR PLAY IN THE BALL JOINTS ALSO)  THE TIRE PRESSURE IN ALL 4 TIRES WAS LOW (LOWER 20 PSI) AND THEY ADDED AIR. AGAIN THE TIRE PRESSURE IS AS IT WAS WHEN IT LEFT THE SHOWROOM.    IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM HAD TO EXIST WHEN WE LEFT THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE VEHICLE AND SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.    IN COMPARISON, MY 2001 EXPLORER HAS 53,000 MILES ON IT AND THE TIRES ARE IN GREAT SHAPE. IT HAS BEEN OFF ROAD ON MANY OCCASIONS, THROUGH THE WORST BONE JARRING POTHOLES ON THE CROSS BRONX EXPRESSWAY AND NEVER HAD ANY ALIGNMENT PROBLEMS.    I NOW HAVE TO PAY TO GET A WHEEL ALIGNMENT AND A NEW SET OF TIRES FOR THE RANGER AND IT ONLY HAS 7845 MILES ON IT.      I FEEL THAT THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE COVERED THE TIRES AND ALIGNMENT UNDER THE 3 YEAR , 36,000 MILE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY.",
