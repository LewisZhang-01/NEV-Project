I took the car to my mechanic, he said I was better off going to the dealer because it was a big electronic problem with power steering but he wasn't sure how to troubleshoot it. This could have ended  a nightmare.. And, I am very upset after doing  research on the Electronic Power Steering Assist problems and recalls for the Chevy Malibu and other GM vehicles over the past 10 yrs it is quite troubling and what really angers me is they don't have a recall for her car which is ridiculous after you spend a little time researching the 2010  Malibu customer complaints due to the power steering failure.",

RETURNED THE CAR TO BILL ESTES CHEVROLET AND AGAIN MY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ESC ERROR RECALL WAS OVERLOOKED. I WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE HAD A CRACKED MANIFOLD AND DAMAGED O2 SENSOR.

THESE ARE ALL COMPATIBLE WITH RECALL NUMBER 13036 OF THIS CHEVROLET MALIBU AND HE CALLED MATTHEWS-HARGEAVES CHEVROLET IN ROYAL OAK, MI AND THEY TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY $100 FOR THEM TO LOOK UP THE RECALL SO I DID NOT TAKE THE VEHICLE IN AT THAT TIME. HE ALSO HAD THE RECALL FOR THE DRIVERS SEAT BELT LIGHT WHICH WAS MALFUNCTIONING AND THEY GAVE HIM THE SAME ANSWER.  DURING THE PAST 10 DAYS THE BRAKE LIGHTS HAVE BEEN MALFUNCTIONING GOING ON WHEN NOT APPLYING THE BRAKES AND GOING OFF WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES.  HE WAS NOTIFIED BY TWO OTHER DRIVERS AND NOTICED IT IN THE GARAGE AND THEN HAD THE POLICE CHECK THEM.  HE WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED ON TWO OCCASIONS.  THE VEHICLE IS NOW TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  I HAVE FLOWN UP TO DETROIT AND WILL TAKE THE VEHICLE TO MATTHEWS-HARGREAVES MYSELF TO HAVE THIS FIXED. I HAVE THE RECALL FOR THE SEAT BELT WHICH IS NOT FIXED BUT WHEN I PUT UP THE VIN NUMBER IT NOW SHOWS NO RECALLS AND THAT CANNOT BE CORRECT.  I NOW HAVE THE BODY CONTROL MODULE PROBLEM (RECALL NUMBER 13036) BUT IF STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FURTHER FROM CHEVROLET AND THE DEALER IS DEMANDING $100 JUST TO CHECK.

I LOOK AT MY GEAR SHIFT AND SAW IT WAS STILL IN REVERSE. I PLAYED WITH THE GEARS MOVING THE LEVEL BACK AND FORTH BUT THE CAR REMAIN IN REVERSE  SO I TURNED MY CAR OFF.

I HAD A FRIEND COME PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME HOME WHERE I WENT ONLINE AND BEGAN DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THIS PART. THAT'S WHEN I CAME ACROSS THE RECALL REF THIS PART .  UNKNOWN TO ME BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER.   THE NEXT DAY THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME AND ADVISE ME THAT MY TRANSMISSION GEAR   SHIFT CABLE  NEEDED TO BE REPLACE. THEY STATED THEY DIDN'T SHOW ANY RECALLS ON MY VIN NO#,SO THE COST WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY.  I CALLED THE NHTSA INQUIRING ABOUT EVERYTHING RELATING TO  RECALL. THEY COULD ONLY CONFIRM THERE IS A RECALL BUT MY VIN IS NOT INCLUDED.

I HAD A FEW STOP LIGHTS ALONG THE WAY HOME, AND EACH TIME THAT I CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND THEN STARTED DRIVING, THE SAME THING WOULD OCCUR.  AS I GOT HOME, I CALLED THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP, DAVID STANLEY CHEVROLET HERE IN OKLAHOMA CITY, TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  IT SAT IN THE GARAGE FOR THE DURATION OF THE WEEKEND, AND THEN I TOOK IT IN THIS MORNING (MONDAY AUG.22ND) FOR MY APPOINTMENT.

A FEW TIMES ON THE TRIP I DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS GOING TO MAKE IT THE WHOLE WAY THERE AND THEN ABOUT A MILE OR SO FROM THE DEALERSHIP, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  LATER, I HAD TO GO IN REVERSE AFTER I ARRIVED AND FOUND THAT THE CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO REVERSE.  I DROPPED IT OFF TO HAVE THEM DO THE DIAGNOSTIC ON IT FOR $120. AS I GOT HOME, MY WIFE AND I DID SOME RESEARCH ON OUR CAR, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE WHILE THE DIAGNOSTIC WAS TAKING PLACE.  I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT I FOUND.

THE ENGINE RUNS FINE HOWEVER THERE IS A SLIGHT VIBRATION AT IDLE WHILE IN PARK OR NEUTRAL. GM ALSO SENT OUT A LETTER TO ME STATING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE POSISTION SENSOR THAT MAY CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN. THE DEALER DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DIAGNOS THE PROBLEM WITH THE SENSOR AND STATED THAT THE ENGINE HAD A BAD #2 CYCLINDER WITH COMPRESSION AT 100LBS. THE P0300 CODE CAN BE CAUSED BY THE VARIOUS ELECTRONIC MESSAGES THAT HAVE APPEARED AND THE ENGINE IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THEY WANTED TO TEAR IT DOWN AT A COST OF $2300 TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST. THIS CAR ONLY HAS 39000 MILES ON IT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THIS SAME ISSSUE WITH NHTSA AND GM HAS NOT DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM. ANOTHER ISSUE RELATING TO THIS IS THE FACT THAT THE ENGINE REDUCED POWER MESSAGE COMES ON IN SOME VEHILCLE AND THE CAR SLOWS DOWN AND IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON THE HIGWAYS.

THE PERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID AS MUCH, TELLING ME THAT CLEANING IT WOULD HELP IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS, IF THAT. THAT MEANS THAT GM IS ALLOWING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO DRIVE THESE CARS KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE BRAKE LIGHTING SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO FAILURE, WHICH IS VERY HARD FOR THE DRIVER TO DETECT.

HOWEVER, PHONE SERVICE REP SAID TO HAVE THE FUSE BOX REPLACED BECAUSE OF INTERNAL SHORT ON POWER SIDE OF WIPER MOTOR ON SIGNAL CIRCUIT.  AFTER THE FUSE BOX WAS REPLACED, THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED.  YET, WE STILL HAD TO PAY FOR THE FUSE BOX REPLACEMENT!  IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT THE TECH FOUND THE WIPER TRANSMISSION LINK BAR WAS BROKEN.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AND LET ME KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS!!  I FIND IT VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A WIPER MOTOR BREAK THREE TIMES IN THREE YEARS.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY CHARGED ON THE LAST ATTEMPT WHERE WE HAD TO PAY FOR A FUSE BOX, YET THAT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT FIRST.

THIS LATEST FOR APPROXIMATELY 10-SECONDS AND DID NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.  THE POWER STEERING ALSO RETURNED TO NORMAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME.  LATER THAT SAME MORNING, I WAS AT A STOP SIGN AND WAS WAITING TO TURN RIGHT.  WHEN TRAFFIC CLEARED ENOUGH FOR ME TO BEGIN MY TURN I TURNED THE WHEEL TO THE RIGHT.  ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THE STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN, AND I HAD TO FIGHT TO COMPLETE THE TURN.  HAD I BEEN AN ELDERLY PERSON, WITHOUT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO FORCE THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN, I WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY CRASHED INTO THE CARS WAITING TO TURN LEFT AT THE INTERSECTION IN QUESTION.  THE STEERING PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED EVER SINCE AND GOTTEN MUCH WORSE OVER TIME.  I'VE NOTICED IF I STOP THE CAR...TURN OFF THE IGNITION...AND RESTART THE CAR THE ELECTRONIC STEERING RESETS AND WILL BE FINE FOR UP TO 10-15 MINUTES.  BUT THE PROBLEM ALWAYS RETURNS.  I LOOKED ONLINE AND SAW THAT MALIBUS FROM 2004-2009 EXPERIENCED THIS SAME PROBLEM AND WERE RECALLED.  I WENT TO MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AND ASKED IF THEY WOULD EXTEND THE RECALL PROTECTION TO COVER MY 2010 MALIBU AND I WAS ADVISED THEY WOULD NOT.  THIS IS A REAL SAFETY PROBLEM, AND WHILE I CAN'T AFFORD THE $2,000 REPAIRS TO GET IT FIXED, I CAN'T IMAGINE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WHEN WINTER ARRIVES AND THE ROADS TURN ICY.   THIS PROBLEM WOULD MOST CERTAINLY CAUSE AND ACCIDENT.

AFTER RESEARCH I BECAME AWARE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH CHEVY MALIBU'S BUT WAS ONLY COVERED IN RECALLS UNTIL 2009.   I PAID FOR REPAIR ON THIS OUT OF POCKET LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS AS SEEN WITH RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET. I HAVE JUST DISCOVERED THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE STEERING COLUMN FOR GM, DORMAN, IS RECALLING THEIR STEERING COLUMN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE 2010 CHEVY MALIBU. THIS RECALL WAS POSTED IN JULY. WITH THE TROUBLE GM HAS BEEN THROUGH THEY SHOULD BE ON A BETTER HONOR SYSTEM. THIS CAR WAS MANUFACTURED BY GENERAL MOTORS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BY GENERAL MOTORS WHO SHOULD BE REIMBURSED BY DORMAN. THE PHONE NUMBER FOR DORMAN IS 1-800-523-2492 AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BE REIMBURSED BUT YOU WILL NEED THE PART NUMBER OF THE DEFECTIVE STEERING COLUMN. GENERAL MOTORS OFFERS NO COOPERATION IN PART NUMBER INFORMATION. EVEN WITH PREVIOUS CALLS I HAD WITH GM SAYING ALL PARTS USED IN CARS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE VIN NUMBER OF THE CAR SO THEY KNOW THE ORIGIN WHERE ALL PARTS WERE MANUFACTURED. IT APPEARS TO BE A FINGER POINTING GAME AND THE LOSER IS THE CONSUMER.   *TR",

SO I TAKE MY CAR BACK TO THE GUY I BOUGHT IT FROM AND HE TRIES TO FIX IT AND CLAIMS HE STOPPED THE LEAK. NOT TRUSTING HIS SKILLS I FINALLY TAKE IT TO CHEVY AND AFTER HAVING IT \"FIXED\" SEVERAL PRIOR TIMES, CHEVY ACTUALLY FIXES IT THIS TIME AROUND.

WHEN CONTACTED THE CHEVROLET DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THEY HAVE TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE. I EXPLAINED ABOUT THE VEHICLE RECALL AND WAS TOLD MY VEHICLE WAS NOT UNDER RECALL. [XXX] ARE THEY WAITING FOR AN ACCIDENT TO OCCUR OR DEATH BEFORE THEY RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I DO NOT THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THEIRSELVES. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY THEM AGAIN IF THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE RESOLVED. I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THEM. REALLY NEED THIS TO BE RESOLVED.  *TR      PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

UPON LOOKING UNDERNEATH MY CAR I FOUND MY GAS TANK LEAKING ONTO MY EXHAUST PIPE. I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A RECALL ISSUE BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DAMAGE TO THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF MY CAR. ONE OF THE OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES I HAVE FOUND WITH MY CAR INCLUDE A BRAKE LIGHT ISSUE. MY CAR WAS OCCASIONALLY SHOWING A \"SERVICE TRACTION/ ESC\" ERROR CODE, WHICH COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY MECHANIC OR EVEN A CHEVY DEALERSHIP THEMSELVES. IT WASN'T UNTIL A FRIEND FOLLOWING ME POINTED OUT THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS DIDN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING RIGHT, DID I REALIZE I WAS HAVING AN ISSUE. THE BRAKE LIGHTS DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY SHOULD, BUT ONLY ON THE OCCASIONS SAID ERROR CODE IS SHOWING.  I LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE ONLINE AND FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM. CHEVY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE ME A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THE THIRD MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT, I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO MY CAR. WHEN I SIT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF MY MALIBU, AMONG EVERY MALIBU I HAVE EVER BEEN, THE  PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DOES NOT TURN ON. I AM 26 AND WEIGH 94LBS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF MY SIZE IS THE REASON I DO NOT ENGAGE THE AIRBAG!? THE FINAL DEFECT I HAD TO DEAL WITH INVOLVED MY DRIVER SIDE RIM. I HAD A TINY LITTLE HAIR LINE CRACK ON THE INSIDE OF MY RIM, CAUSING ME TO LOOSE A LOT OF AIR IN MY TIRE. I CONSIDER THIS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT BECAUSE MY RIM WAS NOT DAMAGED IN ANY OTHER WAY SHAPE OR FORM. I HAD A HARD TIME OBTAINING A NEW RIM, BECAUSE (ACCORDING TO EVERYONE I CALLED) THE RIM WAS IN HIGH DEMAND. PLEASE LOOK INTO THESE ISSUES AND CONSIDER ADDING THEM TO GM'S CURRENT RECALL LIST.

NEEDLESS TO SAY, AFTER HITTING THE 70K MILEAGE MARK THE VEHICLE AIR BAG LIGHT BEGIN TO COME ON AND OFF AND STILL DOES; FURTHERMORE VEHICLE UPON START UP OF THE ENGINE WOULD LAG AS IF SOMETHING WAS NOT CATCHING AND PREVENTING THE VEHICLE FROM STARTING UP PROPERLY, THUS I WOULD HAVE TO HOLD THE KEY TURNED LONGER THAN USUAL. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS VEHICLE AT ALL. AT 70K MILES THIS VEHCILE SHOULD STILL BE RUNNING FLAWLESSLY AS IT IS REGULARLY MAINTAINED AND TUNED-UP. PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE WAS AN EPIC FAIL. I AM SHOCKED THAT CERTAIN MODELS AND YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN PERMANENTLY RECALLED AND REPLACED BY A VEHCILE OF OWNERS CHOICE FROM CHEVROLET (NEEDLESS TO SAY I PROBABLY WOULD NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER CHEVY CAR) FOR THE HEADEACHE WE HAVE HAD TO ENDURE. I HAVE AN INFANT AND A TODDLER AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF VEHICLE OPERATION ON ANY GIVEN DAY AT ANY GIVEN TIME ON A PRACTICALLY NEW VEHCILE NEEDS TO BE THE LEAST OF MY CONCERNS!  *TR",

EARLY IN MARCH, 2013, I HAD NOTICED AS I WAS BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY TO GO TO WORK, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BECOME MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO TURN AND THERE WOULD BE A MESSAGE ON THE DASH THAT JUST READ POWER STEERING. THIS WOULD ONLY LAST FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, AND THEN IT WOULD GO AWAY AND THE STEERING WOULD BE FINE. I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM THE COLD WEATHER.     ON FRIDAY, MARCH 15, I HAD STOPPED AT A FEW DIFFERENT PLACES, WAS HAVING NO ISSUES THAT I COULD TELL. I GOT INTO MY CAR TO LEAVE THE LAST STOP, STARTED THE CAR AND BEGAN TO BACK OUT OF THE PARKING LOT. I DIDN'T SEE A MESSAGE AT FIRST AND IT FELT LIKE I HAD A FLAT TIRE. ABOUT 5 SECONDS LATER THERE WERE 4 DINGS AND THE DASH SAID POWER STEERING AGAIN AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VERY SLUGGISH. I'D BEEN HALF EXPECTING IT TO START WORKING AGAIN, BUT AFTER SPEAKING WITH A REP AT AN AUTO PARTS STORE, THEY TOLD ME IT SOUNDED LIKE THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST MOTOR ON THE RACK-AND-PINION HAD SHORTED, CAUSING A FUSE TO BLOW WHICH WAS SOMETHING GM HAD ALREADY PUT A RECALL OUT FOR OTHER VEHICLES, EXCEPT MY MODEL YEAR.    I SPOKE WITH THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY RECALL THAT WAS OUT ON THE CAR AT THE MOMENT WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE GEAR SHIFT INDICATOR AND I WILL BE TAKING CARE OF THAT SOON. THEY WANT ME TO TAKE IT IN FOR DIAGNOSTICS TO SEE WHAT GM WILL COVER FOR REPAIRS, BUT HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR A PROBLEM THAT GM DIDN'T FIX RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  *TR",
