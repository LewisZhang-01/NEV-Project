        "summary": "WE HAD TRAVELED ABOUT 60 MILES AND WERE ABOUT 70 MILES FROM HOME WE HAD A BLOW OUT, THESE ARE THE TIRES THAT WERE ON THE TRAILER WHEN WE PURCHASED IT.  THEY ARE THE CASTLEROCK TIRES. WE PULLED OVER TO A SAFE LOCATION AND CHANGED THE TIRE, WITH THE SPARE THAT WAS SUPPLIED WITH THE TRAILER.  ABOUT 20 MILES FURTHER WE HAD A 2ND BLOWOUT ON THE SAME SIDE, DIFFERENT TIRE, WHEN WE TRIED TO DRIVE TO A SAFE LOCATION (THIS IS A 2 LANE ROAD WITH A HIGH AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC DUE TO THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND) THERE WAS VERY CLOSE CALL BETWEEN 2 OTHER VEHICLES WHICH CAUSED ONE TO LEAVE THE ROADWAY AND ENDED UP ON THE DITCH ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  ALL TO AVOID HITTING US.    WE AS CONSUMERS PUT OUR FAITH IN THE COMPANIES WE DEAL WITH TO PUT RELIABLE EQUIPMENT ON THE RECREATIONAL VEHICLES WE PURCHASE.  THE TIRES SUPPLIED WITH THIS TRAILER SHOULD NOT BE USED TO HAUL LOADS OF ANY KIND. THESE ARE WHAT WAS SUPPLIED WITH THE TRAILER, IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE TIRE THAT THE MAX LOAD IS 2460 LBS.  THAT SEEMS WAY LOW FOR PACKING A TOYHAULER WITH THE WATER TANK FULL, GAS TANK FULL AND LOADED WITH TOYS.  WE HAD TO REPLACE ONE TIRE LAST YEAR AFTER TRAVELING LESS THAN 500 MILES.    NOT ONLY DID WE AVOID A CLOSE CALL WITH WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENT TRYING TO MAKE IT TO A SAFE LOCATION, BUT THERE IS MAJOR DAMAGE DONE INSIDE THE TRAILER.    PACIFICCOACHWORKS HAS BEEN NOTIFIED.  THE TRAILERS ARE NOT SAFE, AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE INSIDE THE TRAILER THAT WAS DONE FROM THESE BLOWOUTS.  THE INSIDE OF THE WHEEL WELL IS PLYWOOD THE PLYWOOD THAT WAS BLOWN OUT IN THE WHEEL WELL EXPOSED WIRES THAT SUPPORT THE ELECTRICAL INSIDE THE TRAILER.  THERE WAS RUBBER FROM THE TIRE INSIDE THE BEDROOM AT THE VERY FRONT OF THE TRAILER.  THE BACK BLOWOUT BLEW OUT THE BACK SIDE OF THE TRAILER, INCLUDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE SUPPORT TO THE BACK PORTION OF THE TRAILER.",
