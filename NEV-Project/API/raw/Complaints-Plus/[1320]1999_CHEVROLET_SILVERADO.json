THE RESULTING 1/22/14 SERVICE NOTES WERE: \"DIAGNOSE & FOUND LEFT FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSOR DROPPING OUT.  INSPECT WIRING FOR POOR CONNECTIONS OR DAMAGED WIRING.  ALL OK.  GAVE ESTIMATE TO REPLACE LEFT FRONT WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY.\"  IN PERSON, THE DEALERSHIP SAID THIS BEARING WAS WORN & WAS CAUSING ABS ACTIVATION.

AT ABOUT 2:00PM ON JULY 9, 2013, WE WERE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 30MPH DOWN A GRADE ON WISCONSIN HIGHWAY 23 TOWARD THE INTERSECTION WITH I-43 BUSINESS ROUTE, BOTH HIGHWAYS ARE 4 LANES WITH LEFT TURN LANES AND THERE IS TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL. WHEN I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES TO STOP FOR THE RED LEFT TURN SIGNAL, THERE WAS ALMOST NO BRAKE EFFECT. I WAS ABLE TO RAPIDLY PUMP THE BRAKE PEDAL ENOUGH TO STOP,BUT ENDED UP ABOUT 5-10 FEET INTO THE CROSS-TRAFFIC LANE. FORTUNATELY, THE TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT AT THE TIME AND AS A RESULT, NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED. AFTER CREEPING OUR UNITS INTO A PARKING LOT, I CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD, FOUND NOTHING THERE, THEN CHECKED UNDER THE VEHICLE AND SAW A PUDDLE OF BRAKE FLUID. BY USING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND TRAVELING SLOWLY, WE MADE IT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP. THEY EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OF THE BRAKE LINES HAD CORRODED BADLY WHERE THEY EXIT THE CENTRAL CONTROL BLOCK OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK. THEY WERE LEAKING SLOWLY AND AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD FINALLY FAILED. WE HAD PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT WOULD NOT COVER PART FAILURES DUE TO CORROSION. THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE OWNERS MANUAL ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF BRAKE LINE CORROSION AND THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AT THE SHEBOYGAN CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP OFFERED NO INFORMATION. WHEN I DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF ED BOZARTH CHEVROLET IN TOPEKA, THEY OFFERED NO EXPLANATION. THIS COST US $935.66 TO REPAIR AND VERY NEARLY RESULTED IN SERIOUS BODILY HARM TO MY WIFE AND MYSELF.

UPON INSPECTION I NOTICED A LARGE PUDDLE OF FLUID UNDER THE DRIVER??S SIDE JUST BEHIND THE FRONT WHEEL.  LATER THAT EVENING I HAD MY WIFE PUMP THE BRAKES AND WITNESSED A SIGNIFICANT STREAM OF BRAKE FLUID SPEWING FROM A BUNDLE OF METAL BRAKE LINES LOCATED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME RAIL, OPPOSITE THE  ABS CONTROL MODULE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I NOTICED ALL OF THE METAL BRAKE LINES WERE VISIBLY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY, CORRODED/RUSTED.  THE LOCATION OF THE LINE RUPTURE WAS NOWHERE NEAR A JOINT, FITTING, OR LINE BEND.      I PURCHASED THIS TRUCK USED IN OCTOBER OF 2008 FROM A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN DANVILLE, INDIANA WITH APPROXIMATELY 89,979 MILES ON IT.  THE BODY, WHEELS, AND INTERIOR ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND WOULD LEND YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THE TRUCK WAS GENERALLY WELL MAINTAINED AND REGULARLY GARAGED.

THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SOME GM PRODUCT DEFICIENCIES AND I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A MANDATORY SAFETY RECALL WITH RESTITUTION BEING MADE BY GM. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS SITUATION.

I ALSO STATED THAT THIS WAS TOO NEW OF A VEHICLE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM TO OCCUR REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE AND THAT I FELT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO A FACTORY DEFAULT.  IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET REIMBURSED FOR HAVING THIS PROBLEM FIXED BUT IT WOULD BE GREATER IF THE INFORMATION ON THIS FACTORY DEFAULT GOT OUT AND POSSIBLY SAVED SOMEONE'S LIFE.   *JB",

WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE SENSOR IS DIRTY AGAIN?I DON'T SEE HOW THIS COULD BE A CORRECTIVE ACTION, BECAUSE THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING AGAIN IS GREAT.  MY FATHER OWNED THIS TRUCK BEFORE ME AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM I AM NOW HAVING THE ABS ENGAGING AT LOW SPEEDS, (I ALMOST CRASHED TWICE, BECAUSE OF THIS).

THE TRUCK WAS UNDER WARRANTY SO THE SERVICE MANAGER PUT DOWN THAT THE HUBS WERE BAD SO MY DAD WOULD NOT HAVE TO INCUR THE COST. (SENSOR IS WARRANTY ITEM, HUBS ARE NOT). (COUNTRY CLUB CHEVROLET ONEONTA, NY) ONCE AGAIN MY FATHER WAS TOLD THE SENSOR CAN NOT BE REPLACED WITH OUT CHANGING THE HUBS. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THIS BY TWO OTHER DEALERS. (NORRIS CHEVROLET WESTFIELD , NJ- SULLIVAN CHEVROLET ROSEPARK, NJ).  THE HUBS WERE REPLACED AT 60,000 MILES, AT 72,000 THE PROBLEM ONCE AGAIN RETURNED. SO THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 7 MONTHS, I KNOW WHEN DRIVING THE TRUCK TO GIVE MYSELF EXTRA STOPPING DISTANCE, IT DOES NOT ALWAYS DO IT MOSTLY AFTER SHARP TURNS (PULLING IN DRIVE WAY OR PARKING LOT).  SO IF THE HUBS HAVE TO BE REPLACED AS PER  THREE DEALERS, SO WHY DOES THE RECALL CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKE ABOUT REMOVING SENSOR AND CLEANING (SEE FOLLOWING)  DEALERS ARE TO REMOVE THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR AND THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR MOUNTING SURFACE ON THE BEARING, APPLY RUST INHIBITOR TO THE CLEANED SURFACE, GREASE THE MOUNTING SURFACE, REINSTALL THE WHEEL SPEED SENSOR, AND CHECK THE PEAK-TO-PEAK OUTPUT VOLTAGE TO ENSURE THE WHEEL SPEED SIGNAL IS WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS.

THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOUDL BE RECALLED OR ON EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I READ ON A WEBSITE THAT MANY MANY OTHER TRUCK OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  I AM LOOKING AT UPWARDS OF $1200 TO HAVE THIS MODULE ON THE ABS PUMP FIXED, AND THAT MIGHT NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM LONG TERM.  IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN RIGHT AWAY.  I WOULD APPRECIATE GM OR CHEVY RECALLING THIS MALFUCNTION TO THE ABS BEFORE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT TAKES PLACE.    I PURCHASHED A CHEVY TRUCK TO AVOID THESE TYPES OF ISSUES.

ON 7-1-04, MY HUSBAND, DRIVING ON A COUNTY PARK ROAD AT 15-20 MPH, WENT OVER A SPEED BUMP AND THE TAIL GATE OPENED AND THE RIGHT REAR CABLE ON THE TAILGATE BROKE IN TWO. THE TAILGATE, HANGING FROM THE LEFT CABLE, WAS DAMAGED AS IT WAS DRAGGED ABOUT 10 FT.  THE CABLE, WHICH IS COVERED WITH PLASTIC, WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED UNDER THE PLASTIC COVER.  THE TOP OF THE CABLE COVER DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY OPEN ACCESS TO WATER, SO IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT AN INSPECTION OF THE CABLE WOULD HAVE SHOWN ANY WEAR.     THE DEALER TOLD US THERE WAS A CABLE RECALL FOR MODEL YEARS 2000 AND ON, BUT NOT THE 1999.  REPAIR WORK WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  HE REFERRED US TO GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE.  I SPOKE WITH A MANAGER, ROBERT BECKETT, WHO OPENED A COMPLAINT FILE#1-232-773-551.  HE ALSO SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO SINCE WE WERE OUTSIDE OUR NEW VEHICLE WARRANTY.  IT WAS SIMPLY A MAINTENANCE/WEAR ITEM.  HE SAID HE INSPECTS HIS TAILGATE CABLES EVERY TIME HE CHANGES HIS OIL.   A MAN I KNOW WHO WORKED FOR GM FOR 20 YEARS AND HAS OWNED PICK-UP TRUCKS ALL OF HIS LIFE SAID HE NEVER CHECKS THE TAILGATE CABLES ON ANY OF HIS TRUCKS, HAS NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE WHO DOES, AND THINKS THAT THIS MANAGER'S IMPLICATION THAT IT WAS NEGLIGENCE ON OUR PART IS UNFOUNDED.   WE PURCHASED TWO NEW CABLES A GM PARTS DEALER AND INSTALLED THEM.  WE STILL HAVE THE DEFECTIVE CABLE.   WE FEEL THIS ACCIDENT WAS A RESULT OF A PART DEFECT AND THAT GM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE REPAIR AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT.     FORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T BREAK WHEN SOMEONE STOOD ON THE TAILGATE, AS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER TRUCK OWNERS, RESULTING IN BODILY INJURY, OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC OR ON A HIGHWAY.   THIS GM MANAGER SAID THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER I COULD DO.  HE GAVE ME THE ADDRESS TO MAIL A COMPLAINT (CHEVROLET, PO BOX 33170, DETROIT, MI 48232) BUT THAT IT WAS POINTLESS BECAUSE THE LETTER WOULD END UP ON HIS DESK.  PLEASE HELP.    *LA",

I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR AND MODEL TRUCK AND AS OF NOW GM WILL NOT REPLACE IT FREE OF CHARGE.

I SEARCHED THE WEB USING GOOGLE AND FOUND MORE OF THE SAME COMPLAINT THEN I COULD COUNT. AFTER GOING ON THE NHTSA WEB SITE I FOUND ABOUT 100 COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAVE. I ALSO CHECKED THE NHTSA RECALL LIST AND FOUND A SAFETY RECALL (NHTSA RECALL NO. 00V055/GM RECALL NO. 00013) ON 10,600 2000 CHEVROLET SILVERADO, S10, AND SERRA TRUCKS FOR A DEFECTIVE ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM MOTOR THAT MAY BECOME NON-FUNCTIONAL AND CAUSE THE DYNAMIC REAR PROPROTIONING (DRP) SYSTEM, WHICH OPTIMIZES FRONT TO REAR BRAKE BALANCE, TO BECOME INOPERATIVE, INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CRASH.

WHILE PULLING OUT OF MY GARAGE, THE \"ABS\" LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD CAME ON AND THE ELECTRONIC BRAKE CONTROL MODULE (EBCM) RAN CONTINUOUSLY, EVEN WITH THE IGNITION KEY OFF, AND REMOVED.  AS ADVISED BY DEALER, I PULLED THE 60A FUSE AND THE EBCM STOPPED RUNNING.  I BROUGHT TRUCK IN TO DEALER AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE EBCM MODULE WOULD NEED REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF $1,039.68 ($807. FOR THE PART, $232.06 LABOR).  FROM INTERNET RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR/MODEL TRUCK.  ALSO DISCOVERED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH THE ABS BRAKES DISABLED (EBCM 60A FUSE PULLED) BECAUSE OF THE HIGH REPAIR COST.  I FELL THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD INDICATOR LIGHTS, \"ABS\" AND \"BRAKES\" ARE BOTH ILLUMINATED ALL THE TIME ONCE THE EBCM MODULE IS DISABLED.  THIS NEGATES THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE IF A BRAKE FAILURE MAY BE IMMINENT BECAUSE THE INDICATOR LIGHTS ARE ALWAYS ON.  I ALSO FEEL THAT IF A PERSON WERE TO PULL THE FUSES TO THESE WARNING LIGHTS SO THEY NO LONGER ILLUMINATE, AS WELL AS DISABLE (PULL THE 60A FUSE)  THE EBCM MODULE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRADE THE VEHICLE IN (TO AVOID THE EXPENSIVE REPAIR), THE DEALER MAY NOT DISCOVER THIS FACT AND COULD RESELL THE TRUCK WITH THE CUSTOMER ASSUMING HE/SHE HAS ANTILOCK BRAKES WHEN IN FACT THEY DON'T.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A SEVERE ACCIDENT BECAUSE HANDLING A SKID WITH ABS IS DIFFERENT THAT HANDLING A SKID WITHOUT ABS.

A SERVICE MANAGER TOOK THIS VEHICLE FOR A TEST DRIVE BY HIMSELF IN THE PARKING LOT AND DID A COUPLE OF TURNS AND A 180-DEGREE TURN.  HE ALSO FOUND THAT IT DID HAVE A JERKY OR JUMPING MOVEMENT AS IT WENT INTO THE TURN.  THIS FRONT WHEEL BINDING MAY BE SOME TYPE OF DESIGN IRREGULARITY OR FLAW, WHICH OCCURS WHILE IN THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE MODE.  SINCE THE SERVICE MANAGER CONSIDERS IT A NORMAL CONDITION, AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE AT HIS LEVEL TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IRREGULARITY SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.  WHY, BECAUSE THESE ERRATIC MOVEMENTS COULD JERK, BIND, OR STOP THE VEHICLE AT ANY SPEED IF THE STEERING WHEEL IS BEING TURNED AND THE VEHICLE IN MOTION.   NOWHERE IN MY OPERATOR'S MANUAL, OR ON THE DASH IS THERE ANY STICKER WHICH IDENTIFIES THAT THIS VEHICLE WHILE IN A 4-WHEEL DRIVE MODE WILL JERK OR BIND WHILE TURNING CORNERS.*AK",

SEATBELTS DO NOT HELP AS THEY ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEAT.  WHEN DRIVING, SEAT SLIDES FORWARD AND BACKWARD FREELY.  WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED THE SEAT SLIDES FORWARD, CAUSING THE FOOT TO HIT THE BRAKES HARDER, THEREBY CAUSING AN ABRUPT STOP.  LUCKILY MY CHILDREN WHO WERE PASSENGERS AT THE TIME HAD THEIR SEATBELTS ON OR THEY WOULD HAVE HIT THE DASH.   MOST VEHICLES NEVER HAVE THIS OCCUR IN THEIR LIFETIME, BUT THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE WITHIN A YEAR AND A HALF.  FIRST TIME WAS AUGUST OF 2000.  COST TO REPLACE IS OVER $500.  I FEEL THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE VEHICLE WHEN OPERATING, ESPECIALLY WHEN STOPPING.  THE SEATBELTS DON'T HELP AS THEY ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEAT.  MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME IS IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT THESE BRACKETS WILL NOT HOLD!!!  I AM A 120 POUND WOMAN, I DO NOT ADJUST THE SEAT OFTEN, I KEEP IT POSITIONED ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK.  MY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THESE RAILINGS TO BREAK.  I HAVE CHILDREN WHO WILL BE COMING OF AGE TO DRIVE.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO A LESS EXPERIENCE DRIVER?  WHAT IF PASSENGERS DIDN'T HAVE SEATBELTS ON?  WHAT IF I WAS HAULING A TRAILER?  WHAT OF THE FORCE OF THE ADDED WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER WHEN STOPPING?  WHAT OF THE CONTENTS ON THAT TRAILER?  WHAT IF I HAVE A MINOR ACCIDENT, SAY A REAR END COLLISION, WILL MY SEAT HOLD ME IN PLACE?  I DON'T HAVE FAITH THEY WILL!

SILVERADO ABS MODULATORS NEED TO BE RECALLED! THEY ARE GETTING WATER IN THEM. THERE ARE NUMERIOUS LISTING ON THIS SITE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. NHTSA NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE! IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR CONSUMERS TO TAKE THE HIT ON A FAILED, POORLY DESIGNED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. THE MORE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES THE MORE THESES ELECTRONIC UNITS COST TO REPLACE. THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN IS THAT TEN YEARS FROM KNOW WHEN A ELECTRONIC UNIT FAILS AT A THOUSAND MILES OVER AND OUT OF WARRANTY, IT WILL HAVE TO SIT IN THE DRIVEWAY BECAUSE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WONT HAVE THE CASH AVAILABLE TO FIX IT. I HAD A ABS MODULATOR FAIL AT 54,000 MILE, THE UNIT WOULD NOT TURN OFF, EVEN WITH THE KEY OUT. I HAD TO PULL THE FUSE TO STOP IT. THE DEALER WOULD NOT DO A XXXX THING ABOUT IT AND NEITHER WOULD GM. THE DEALERSHIPS ARE RTEPLACING ALOT OF THESE UNITS.THAT MEANS THERE IS A DEFECT (POOR DESIGN) WITH THIS UNIT. ANYBODY WITH THIS DEFECT SHOULD GET A NEW AND IMPROVED UNIT FOR FREE REGARDLESS OF WARRANTY! I HAVE A MORE DESCRIPTIVE EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM ON THIS SITE, AGAIN THE ODI ID # IS 745532. I'M AN ENGINEER AND IT PISSES ME OFF WHEN A COMPANY HIDES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WHEN AN ISSUE LIKE THIS ARISES. IT PISSES ME OFF EVEN MORE WHEN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY (NHTSA) THAT IS SUPPOSE TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS SAFTEY FAILS TO CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE. I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER IF NHTSA ACTUALLY READ THESE COMPLAINTS. I SUBMITTED ODI ID 745532 FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AGO, MAY BE EVEN LONGER THAN THAT AND STILL NO WORD. ANY BODY THAT WANTS TO CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE AN EMAIL ME AT JABRANT@EMAIL.SAE.ORG. *AK",

WHEN THE UNIT FAILED I WENT TO THE DEALER IN NORMAN, OK (MARK HEITZ) AND TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT IT. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY REPLACE THESE UNITS QUITE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY GET WATER IN THEM AND SHORT OUT. NOT BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE UNIT I ASKED MORE QUESTION. THE ECU IS SEALED TO THE PUMP AND WHEN WATER ENTERS THROUGH THE SEAL IT SHORTS OUT THE ECU AND STARTS RUSTING OUT THE PUMP. THE RUST IN THE PUMP CONCERNS ME BECAUSE IT CAN POTENTIALY CONTAMINATE THE BRAKE FLUID AND CAUSE BRAKE FAILURE. TOM-THE SERVICE MANAGER AT MARK HEITZ EXACT WORDS \"THE PUMP HAD WATER IN IT AND IT WAS FULL OF RUST\" MARK HEITZ PHONE NUMBER IS 405-321-7021.        THE OTHER FAILURE IS THE PARKING BREAK. I DONT THINK IT EVER WORKED THE DAY IT CAME OFF THE DEALER LOT. THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TOUSED THE PARKING BRAKE WAS AT BEAVER LAKE IN ARKANSAS ON A CAMPING TRIP. THIS WAS LAST SUMMER -SUMMER OF 2000-. I PARKED ON A STEEP HILL AND APPLIED THE PARKING BREAK . THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR RATER EASILY AND I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT, THAT WAS UNITLL I GOT IN THE TRUCK AND TRIED TO PUT IT IN DRIVE, I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT OUT OF PARK. THE NUT ON THE TENSIONER SHAFT TO THE PARKING BRAKE SYSTEM UNDER THE TRUCK IS COMPLETELY TIGHTENED. THE CABLE BRANCES OFF TO EACH REAR CALIPER AND IS EACH ATTACHED TO A LEVER ON THE CALIPERS. I'VE OBSERVED THE LEVERS MOVE AND STILL NO PARKING BRAKE. THE LEVERS LOOK TO BE FULLY ENGAGED, THAT IS THE LEVERS ARE PULLED AS FAR FORWARD AS POSSIBLE BY THE CABLES.

IN MY OPINION, THE SYSTEM IMPLIES THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO UNLOCK THE VEHICLE QUICKLY AND FROM SOME REMOTE POSITION SO THAT ENTRY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IMMEDIATELY UPON REACHING THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS, OR COULD BE, AN IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE RELATING TO THE WELFARE OF THE PERSON TRYING TO EXERCISE THE REMOTE UNLOCKING FUNCTION.  HOWEVER, THE REMOTE TRANSMITTERS CAN AND, BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DO, BECOME UNSYNCHRONIZED WITH THE VEHICLE LOCKS.  ON THE DATE IN QUESTION, BOTH MY TRANSMITTER AND THE TRANSMITTER CARRIED BY MY WIFE FAILED TO UNLOCK THE TRUCK.  IT WAS NECESSARY TO USE THE KEY TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THE VEHICLE.  WHILE THERE WAS NO DANGER AT THAT TIME, IT CAUSED MY WIFE GREAT CONCERN THAT SHE COULD BE \"CAUGHT\" IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE ACTUALLY WAS DANGER.  SUCH A \"PANIC\" SITUATION WOULD, AT BEST, BE EXCERBATED BY AN UNSYNCHRONIZED REMOTE TRANSMITTER; AND, AT WORST, COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A SITUATION RESULTING IN HER BODILY HARM.  THE OWNER'S MANUAL FOR THE SILVERADO EXPLAINS THAT THE REMOTES WILL OCCASIONALLY NEED TO BE RESYNCHRONIZED AND GIVES THE PROCEDURE TO BE USED.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANUAL IS USUALLY LOCATED IN THE LOCKED VEHICLE AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR REFERENCE DURING A TIME OF NEED.  IN ADDITION, IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE REMOTE DID NOT WORK, SO IT GETS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE RESORTING THE MANUAL KEY-ENTRY.  IN A PANIC SITUATION, TIME IS AT A PREMIUM.  WHILE NONE OF THE FOREGOING RELATES TO AN UNSAFE VEHICLE OPERATING CONDITION, IN MY OPINION IT COULD DEFINITELY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEFARE OF A DRIVER TRYING TO QUICKLY ENTER THE VEHICLE.  IN THAT SENSE, IT BECOMES A VEHICLE SAFETY ISSUE.  *AK",
