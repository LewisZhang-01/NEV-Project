They won't allow control of the HVAC system or activation of the front defrost/defog. The touchscreen controls can not over ride the fault which means no driver control. When it faults, the HVAC goes to the highest setting of 85deg F, the blower goes to high and can't be changed which is a defrost/defog safety issue. Sometimes it will stop if you continue pressing \"OFF\" for 5-10 minutes. It will continue beeping which is distracting and can be indistinguishable from other warning sounds. Also a safety issue.

The check engine wrench lights up when the car goes into this mode. Unannounced, the sudden and immediate slowing of the car leaves it unsafe to driver, passengers, and others on the road who find themselves behind a fast moving car that suddenly and without notice drastically slows down on its own. It is an uncontrollable unsafe and hazardous creeping condition. The car restarts and drives after being placed in park and shut down. The car then drives normally until the next limp situation. Once the car is turned off and restarted however the check engine wrench clears from display screen, and the code itself clears from the pcm. This has made the intermittent events impossible to catch upon being diagnosed by the dealer. We finally had to drive with our code diagnostic device to try and catch the problem as and when it suddenly arose in traffic. Last week the problem occurred again. We were able to get to the side of the highway and plug in the diagnostic device and pull a single code; DTC P2111. Upon researching the code we found that this unsafe problem as been known to Ford for sometime, but we were not in that group of owners who were sent letters explaining the extended warranty program put into place to correct this situation. That Customer Satisfaction Program, 13N03, extended the warranty period to 10 yrs from in-service and 1500 miles. Our vehicle, a 2013 Lincoln Mks with 110800 mis., is clearly is being affected by the throttle stuck open/closed defect (P2111), and, clearly falls within the extended warranty coverage period. We have tried to get Ford to handle our P2111 Code problem as it has corrected others it acknowledged and repaired, but Ford declined. Ford told us that since NHTSA had not assigned coverage to our VIN#, so it cannot come under the program. We are asking that our car be placed in the program and repaired.",
