WHEN STOPPED ON SURFACE STREETS (AND ON THE FREEWAY), IT WAS NECESSARY TO SHIFT TO NEUTRAL AND ADD FUEL TO THE ENGINE TO KEEP IT RUNNING.

AFTER EXTENSIVE EXPOSURE OF ENGINE INTERNAL PARTS, DEALER DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT A ROCKER ARM HAD BROKEN AT ONE OF THE CYLINDERS, RESULTING IN DEBRIS FALLING THROUGH THE VALVE OPENING INTO THE CYLINDER AND SCORING THE VALVE SEAT AND THE PISTON.  THE DEALER RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE ENGINE.   -- AT THAT TIME, THE VEHICLE HAD ACCUMULATED 83,000 MILES OF MODERATE DRIVING, AND WAS ONLY A LITTLE OVER 11 YEARS OLD.

I RECENTLY WENT TO AUTO SHOP AND WAS TOLD CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND SUSPENSION NEED TO BE REPLACED.      AFTER INVESTIGATION I REALIZED THERE WAS RECALLS ON THE 2005 STS V8 MODEL FOR THE BRAKES, SUSPENSION AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 12 YEARS AND 200000 MILES.  THE FACT IS THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWED MY CAR WAS BUILT IN 2005 AND THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURE DATE ON VEHICAL WAS 6/20/2005 WHICH WAS LAST DATE OF PRODUCTION FOR THE 05 MODEL. THE 2006 MANUFACTURE OR BUILD DATE BEGAN ON 6/23/05. IT SEEMS ODD ALL THE RECALLS FOR THE 05 MODEL ARE ALL THE YEAR OLD VEHICLE ARE FACED WITH. I CALLED CADILLAC AND THEY SAID ALTHOUGH THE BUILD DATE OF VEHICLE IS VALID THE VIN NUMBER IS WHAT IS FOLLOWED. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH SHOWS THEY ACTUALLY FOUND THE SAME RECALL ON THE 05 CATALYTIC CONVERTER ON A 2007 CADILLAC.        EVERYTHING POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE MY 2006 MODEL WAS ACTUALLY EITHER A LATE MODEL OF A 2005 BY THE BUILD DATE OF 6/20/05 AND OR THE SAME PARTS HAVE BEEN USED AS THE 2005 RECALL. LASTLY THE VIN NUMBER WHEN I PULLED UP ON A SITE SHOWED IT WAS ACTUALLY A CTS MODEL.  I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DATA I COULD SHARE THAT WOULD BACK THAT MY 2006 STS V8 ACTUALLY IS PART OF THE RECALL CARS.       I UNDERSTAND THE VIN NUMBER IS WHAT IS LOOKED AT BUT WHEN MODEL YEAR CARS ARE BEING MADE AND SOLD AS DIFFERENT YEARS THAN WHEN THEY ARE PRODUCED AND RECALLS EFFECT THE YEAR OF ACTUAL BUILD THIS BECOMES VERY CONCERNING. AS IN THE PAST YEAR I WILL BE SPENDING OVER 3000$ PLUS DOLLARS TO FIX THIS CAR.     I.HOPE YOU CAN LOOK INTO.

THE CAR WAS THEN SENT TO THE LOCAL CADILLAC DEALERSHIP, WHICH ALSO STATED THAT ALL FOUR METAL BRAKE LINES HAD CORRODED TO THE POINT TO WHERE THEY WERE ALL LEAKING.

MAY 2010 BROUGHT CAR BACK TO DEALERSHIP TO COMPLAIN. BY THIS TIME MY WIFE HAS REFUSED TO DRIVE IT FOR SAFETY REASONS (PEOPLE THINK SHE IS LETTING THEM INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN CAR SLOWS DOWN). LOOKED ON INTERNET AND FOUND OTHER COMPLAINTS. I WAS TOLD GM ENGINEERING IS AWARE OF ISSUE AND ARE WORKING ON SOLUTION.

GM EXECUTIVE AND SERVICE MANAGER OF CADILLAC CALLED TO SAY THAT THE CAR WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY. THERE IS NO FIX ON IT. I TOLD THEM THE 2011 STS RENTAL I DROVE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM LOSING POWER WHILE IN A TURN. THEY SAID IT IS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. I SAID \"SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE OLD SYSTEM\" .

SHE REITERATED THAT CADILLAC MAY PAY FOR REPAIRS AFTER DIAGNOSIS.  I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IN MY CAR WOULD FAIL IF NEEDED.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TWO MODELS SHARE A SIGNIFICANT-ENOUGH LEVEL OF ENGINEERING, PARTS AND ASSEMBLY THAT CADILLAC SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.     CONSIDERING (1) THE ISSUE ISN'T A POTENTIAL PROBLEM BUT ACTUALLY EXISTS IN MY CAR, AND (2) THEIR REFERENCE OF \"...CERTAIN OTHER 2005-2007 MODELS\" INDICATES THEIR/YOUR SUSPICION THAT THE ISSUE CROSSES OVER TO OTHER MODELS, I FIND THEIR POSITION THAT I SHOULD PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS UNACCEPTABLE.  MY REQUEST IS THAT CADILLAC DIAGNOSE AND FIX MY AIR BAG ISSUE AT THEIR EXPENSE.  I INTEND TO PURSUE THE ISSUE THROUGH THE STATE AND OTHER MEANS.  UPDATED 05/24/11  *TR",

I CONTACTED MICHELIN TO DISCUSS WARRANTY COVERAGE AND THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO BRING THE CAR INTO A SERVICE CENTER TO ANALYZE FOR WARRANTY.

I CONTACTED CADILLAC CUSTOMER SERVICE SPECIFICALLY (AND ADAMANTLY) REQUESTED THAT A REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FROM CADILLAC COME TO THE DEALERSHIP TO REVIEW THE CAR  WITH ME & THE DEALERS SERVICE MANAGER.

MY CONTENTION IS THIS; CADILLAC IS IGNORING THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM, BLAMING IT ON \"WORN OUT\" TIRES, WHEN IN FACT THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.

THE IMPACT WAS SO SEVERE IT BENT THE CENTER POST BETWEEN THE DOORS AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAD TO BE CUT OUT OF THE VEHICLE. THE SIDE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. A FEW DAYS EARLIER I HAD TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH MY MOTHER SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE SIGN ON THE MIRROR READ \"AIRBAG OFF\". CADILLAC ASSIGNED A SERVICE REQUEST NUMBER 1-437819043 BUT TO DATE REFUSE TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH ME. QUESTION: HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAGS? ARE WE RIDING AROUND WITH THE FALSE IMPRESSION WE ARE PROTECTED??      DECEMBER 7, 2006 I DID HEAR FROM A CADILLAC REPRESENTATIVE TODAY.  THE CADILLAC REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED ME MY CAR DID NOT HAVE SIDE AND CURTAIN AIR BAGS AND IT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE AS AN OPTION.  I ASKED HIM TO GIVE ME THE OPTION NUMBER.  NEEDLESS TO SAY WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT AND I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT BELIEVE A REPRESENTATIVE OF CADILLAC WOULD TELL ME SUCH ERRONEOUS INFORMATION.  ALL THOSE AIR BAGS ARE STANDARD ON THE STS.  APPARENTLY THIS IS A VERY INCOMPETENT GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO A ROCK.  ANYHOW THEY ARE GOING TO RETRIEVE THE AIRBAG MONITORING BOX IN AN EFFORT TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT HAPPENED. *NM",

THE US IS NOW A METRIC COUNTRY AND ALL MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND METRIC CALIBRATION.  EVERY OTHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURER IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO HAVE IP SPEEDOMETERS THAT READ IN BOTH SYSTEMS.  THESE SPEEDOMETER FACEPLATES HAVE A LARGER MPH READING AND A SMALLER KPH ONE BELOW IT SO THAT DRIVERS ALWAYS KNOW HOW FAST THEY ARE DRIVING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP SPEED OF THE VEHICLES.    BUT NOT SO CADILLAC.  CADILLAC ONLY HAS ONE NUMERIC READING ON THE SPEEDOMETER FACE.  THE SPEEDOMETER FACE THEREFORE READS TO 160 IN THE CASE OF THE CADILLAC SRX FOR EXAMPLE.  HOWEVER IF THE DRIVER DECIDES TO SWITCH THE IP TO METRIC HE WILL NOT KNOW HOW FAST HE IS GOING ABOVE 160 KPH WHICH IS 100 MPH.  YOU MIGHT SAY SO WHAT SINCE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEGALLY DRIVE 100 MPH PLUS IN THE US.  PERHAPS, BUT MANY PEOPLE TAKE THEIR CARS TO MEXICO, CANADA AND EUROPE - ALL PLACES WHERE THOSE SPEEDS ARE EITHER TOLERATED OR IN SOME CASES LEGAL.  IF CADILLAC CONTINUES TO SELL VEHICLES WITH THIS QUIRK THEY SHOULD ALLOW AS AN OPTION THE ABILITY TO GET THE KPH GRADED SPEEDOMETER (IE THE ONE SOLD IN CANADA, MEXICO, EUROPE, CHINA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE).

THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THE ONLY WAY THE SENSOR WILL ACTIVATE IS IF THE PASSENGER SQUIRMS AROUND IN THE SEAT IN AN AWKWARD WAY TO HAVE THE SENSOR SENSE THE OCCUPANT. BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE AND ON TWO OCCASIONS THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR ACTUALLY SHUT OFF AFTER A REFUELING OPERATION AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH THE PASSENGER NEVER LEFT THE VEHICLE AND HAD NOT CHANGED POSITION.    (2) FAILURE OF THE PASSENGER SENSOR TO SENSE AN OCCUPANT, IF NOT NOTICED BY THE DRIVER, OR PASSENGER AND TAKING ACTION TO ATTEMPT TO RESET IT WOULD CAUSE THE AIR BAG NOT TO DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A COLLISION.    (3) THE DEALERSHIP TRIED FOR OVER A WEEK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT WOULD ONLY SAY THAT THE PROCEDURE TO ACTIVATE THE SENSOR REQUIRES THE PASSENGER TO ENTER AND SIT IN THE VEHICLE IN A CERTAIN CONVOLUTED WAY THAT IS BASICALLY UN-NATURAL AND IMPOSSIBLE FOR CERTAIN PASSENGERS TO ACHIEVE. AFTER REPEATED CALLS TO GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RAISING THE ISSUE WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU WE WERE TOLD THAT GM ENGINEERS ARE \"NOT ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE AIRBAG SENSOR SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WAS SPECIFIED AND CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\" FURTHER \" IT IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR THEM TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH THEY SYMPATHIZE WITH MY PROBLEM.\"    (4) FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT APPEARS THAT SOME DESIGN/ENGINEERING CONSTRAINTS HAVE BEEN FORCED ON THE MANUFACTURER BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH MAKES THIS SITUATION UNTENABLE AND CREATES A SAFETY HAZARD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO PROPERLY SEAT THEMSELVES IN THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. I THINK THE DESIGN SPECS NEED TO BE CHALLENGED AND RECALLS ISSUED TO MAKE THE PASSENGER-SIDE AIRBAG SENSORS PROPERLY SENSE AN OCCUPANT THAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD EXPECT TO BE PROTECTED BY THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SYSTEM.   *NM",
