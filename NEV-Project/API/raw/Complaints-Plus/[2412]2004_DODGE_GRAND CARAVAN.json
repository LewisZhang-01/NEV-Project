THIS WOULD CONTINUE FOR APPROX 2-3 MILES. IN SUMMER 2013 IT BEGAN HAPPENING EVEN IF THE CAR WAS NOT FILLED TO CAPACITY. REPAIR SHOPS TELL ME IT'S THE TYPE OF GAS OR THERE IS WATER IN THE GAS LINE, BUT MY RESEARCH TELLS ME THIS IS A KNOWN CARAVAN ISSUE.  MY REQUESTS FOR REPAIR INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  SO MY SOLUTION IS TO NEVER FILL THE CAR BEYOND 3/4 TANK - SUPER INCONVENIENT.  AS A RESULT, THE SPUTTERING DOES NOT HAPPEN AS MUCH ANY MORE, BUT THE SITUATION IS DANGEROUS AND SCARY.  I AM JUST WAITING FOR THE ENGINE TO FAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY ROAD SIMPLY BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN FUEL.  *TR",

WHEN AN OPENING ARRIVED SHE PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR AND THE VAN STARTED AND FAILED COMPLETELY, LEAVING US HALF-WAY IN THE LANE FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
