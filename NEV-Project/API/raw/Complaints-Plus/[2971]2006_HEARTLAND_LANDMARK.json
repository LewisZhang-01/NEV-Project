AFTER TAKING IT TO A REPAIR SHOP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED, THE WATER TANK FELL OUT WITH THE SUPPORT LANDING ON THE REAR AXLE.  THIS OCCURRED WHEN THE RV WAS MOVED FROM THE PARKING AREA TO THE SERVICE SHOP AREA.  THE SHOP HAD ANOTHER 2005 LANDMARK THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM - WATER TANK SUPPORT LAYING ON THE REAR AXLE.   THEY FOUND THE WELDS ON WERE JUST SPOT WELDS AND NOT ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE WATER TANKS.  MY WIFE MET ANOTHER COUPLE IN TOWN THAT HAD A 2006 LANDMARK AND HAD THE WATER TANK SUPPORT FAIL AND WAS LAYING ON THE REAR AXLE.  THIS OCCURRED WHILE THEY WERE DRIVING THIS SUMMER.   I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER TWO, BUT OUR WATER TANK WAS NEVER FILLED ABOVE HALF FULL AT ANY TIME SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.  THIS IS 3 IN THE CITY OF TUCSON ALONE THAT I KNOW OF.  THIS TYPE OF THING SHOULD BE COVERED BY A RECALL SINCE IT IS CERTAINLY A HAZARD ON THE HIGHWAYS.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS RVS SINCE THE 1 YEAR WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.    HEARTLAND IS NOT ON THE LIST OF MANUFACTURER'S SO I'M USING ANOTHER.  *TR",
