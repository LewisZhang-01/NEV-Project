        "summary": "This vehicle was sold to us new with the manufacturer's window sticker stating it was equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) as a Standard Accessory - Safety/Cargo Protection. The provided owner's manual describes the TPMS system and the low tire pressure warning lamp indicator on the dash. It was not until our first flat tire after 2.5 years and 24000 miles, that we learned our vehicle does NOT have TPMS OR a low tire pressure warning lamp. Another motorist flagged us down as it was the inside dually tire that deflated and delaminated. Luckily we learned of the deflated inner tire before the outer tire also had issues because of the extra load placed on it.   We have since learned that vehicles with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds and dual-wheel rear axles are not required to have TPMS. The owner's manual does not state this and does not exclude our model as having this safety equipment. As far as we know, this exclusion is not standard public knowledge. Many heavy duty trucks with dual wheels do have such a system, so why should we question our window sticker?  Our issue and safety concern is that we were lead to believe our van did have a TPMS by both our window sticker and our owners manual. Many of these vehicles are being converted to RVs (like ours but has seat belts for 6 passengers) and may be being driven unsafely due to this miscommunication.  Owners/drivers of van conversions and RVs need to be fully aware of the lack of this safety feature.  The dealership we bought the van from has been unhelpful and has said they have forwarded our complaint to Mercedes USA but we have yet to hear anything from them.",

        "summary": "On or about April 27, 2021 the driver's side rear taillight assembly randomly fell off between Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona on Interstate 10. The assembly is large, containing the taillight, brake light, turn signal light and back-up light. It could have (and may have) hit another vehicle or at least caused it/them to engage in a dangerous turning maneuver to avoid hitting the large assembly while on the freeway.  In addition, the RV was then rendered unsafe and in violation of the laws of virtually every state, as well as federal regulations, due to lacking the required lighting assembly. This has also happened to another RV unit from the same manufacturer (Regency). The driver's side taillight assembly fell off this RV during windy conditions on Interstate 40 while traveling through Arkansas on April 2, 2021. There are photos of the missing assembly for both RV's. My RV was inspected by a collision repair facility in California and their determination was two fold: 1) the RV body was molded in way that would not permit the taillight assembly to properly fit in the cavity. The tolerance was off by up to 1/4 of an inch. 2)  the taillight is a stock mercedes sprinter taillight assembly which has three hard point connections (top middle, and bottom.  However, the body of the RV only has two points to connect the taillight assembly (top and bottom) thereby leaving the middle area open to intrusion by wind and other elements. As a result it was very difficult to find a facility to repair/replace the assembly ( they \"did not want to touch it\"). It has now been replaced by a collision facility which used a silicone sealant and HD velcro in the HOPE that the assembly will not fall off again in predictable weather conditions. There was no warning or other indication that the taillight assembly was going to fall off. Finally, Regency claims to manufacture just 200 to 250 of these units annually.  This incident therefore involves 1% of their annual production.",
