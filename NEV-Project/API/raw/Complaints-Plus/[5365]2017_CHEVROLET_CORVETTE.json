Unexpected flat tires without warning is an obvious safety concern for me and anyone around me as I drive.  After looking on the internet, there are 100's of complaints about this and multiple class-action lawsuits.  This should be forced to be a recall and the government should step in. I am surprised that this has reached this point, as a risk analysis engineer.  The field complaints have reached a point where the occurrence rate and the severity of the failure should flag action.  Earlier in my career, I designed and tested wheels as a tier 1 supplier to GM.  I know how GM Tire and Wheel operate. There are specs for impact and fatigue testing and I bet the poor design is very well understood.  I hope you can help.",

I WAS HAVING MY TIRES REPLACED ON MY 2017 CORVETTE Z06 BY DISCOUNT TIRE (TXD56). MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT RIGHT PASSENGER WHEEL WAS CRACKED AND WILL  NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD AIR AND COULD NOT BE REPAIRED, ONLY REPLACED. I TOOK CAR TO CLASSIC CHEVROLET - GRAPEVINE, TX. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED CRACK BUT SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE A DECISION ON WARRANTY COVERAGE DUE TO GM POLICY SPECIFIC TO CORVETTE Z06 AND GS MODELS. THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT COMPLETED AN INSPECTION AND INCLUDED FOLLOWING COMMENT: 996 C/S PASS SIDE REAR WHEEL CRACKED. DID PRA THRU GM AND GM DECLINED TO ASSIST CUSTOMER. PHOTOS OF THE WHEEL CLEARLY SHOW THE CRACK BUT NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL. I CALLED GM CUSTOMER ASSIST CENTER FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION. GM SR. ADVISOR SENT A VOICEMAIL AND EMAIL SAYING THAT MY VEHICLE WAS \"OUT OF WARRANTY\" ( WHICH IS NOT TRUE, AS COVERAGE IS THRU DEC 22,2019.) AND THAT THERE ARE NO DEFECTS TO THE WHEEL. WHEN I FOLLOWED UP WITH ANOTHER CALL, SR. ADVISOR ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT STILL DENIED COVERAGE UNDER BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY AND SAID WHEEL WAS DAMAGED. I TOLD THEM THAT BASED ON REVIEW OF PICTURES AND VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE WHEEL THERE IS NO VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL ONLY THE CRACK.(WHEEL STILL IN MY POSSESSION).  BASED ON CORVETTE ORGANIZATIONS AND POSTINGS, CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO GM OF DEFECTIVE WHEELS CAUSING AIR LEAKS.

THERE ARE 2 CLASS ACTION SUITS FILED AGAINST GM FOR NOT CORRECTING DEFECTIVE  2015 - 2019 CORVETTE Z06 AND GS MODE WHEELS.",

IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A CRACK ALONE THE BEAD RING AREA OF THE INSIDE DRUM AREA OF THE WHEEL. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO COVER UNDER WARRANTY AND DIDN'T OFFER REPAIRS. THE WHEEL WAS TAKEN TO A REPUTABLE WHEEL REPAIR SHOP WITH A GUARANTEE ON THE REPAIR. AFTER DRIVING THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 1000 MILE THE SAME WHEEL STARTED TO LEAK AGAIN. AFTER REMOVING THE WHEEL THERE WAS ANOTHER CRACK APPROXIMATELY 180 DEGREES FROM THE REPAIRED CRACK. AFTER REFUSING TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH A CRACKED WHEEL, IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CAR AND TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ALSO CALLED THE GM PRIORITY CARE AT 866-636-2273. GM PRIORITY CARE GAVE ME THE CASE NUMBER 8-4778215369 . THE DEALERSHIP STILL REFUSED TO COVER THE WHEEL UNDER WARRANTY BUT OFFERED TO SELL ME ANOTHER WHEEL FOR $250. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 19000MILES AND IS MY WIFE'S DAILY DRIVER FOR WORK. THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN ABUSED OR INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENTS. IT HAS BEEN PAINTED DUE TO SCRATCHES FROM TORNADO WIND DAMAGE. I TOOK PICTURES BEFORE THE REPAIR WAS MADE AND ADDITIONAL PICTURE OF THE SECOND CRACK IN THE SAME WHEEL. IN MY OPINION THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE WHEEL WHEN THE FIRST CRACK OCCURRED. NOW I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE GRAND SPORT WHEELS AND WILL REFUSE THEIR OFFER OF GETTING A WHEEL FOR $250. AFTER CHECKING WITH AN AFTERMARKET WHEEL COMPANY FOR REPLACEMENT WHEELS, THEY NOTIFIED ME THAT GM IS AWARE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE GRAND SPORT  WHEEL AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPLACEMENT. THE CAR IS CURRENTLY NOT SAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL I GET A REPLACEMENT WHEEL. SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CRACK IN THE WHEEL.",

THE ISSUE IS THAT THESE WHEELS BEND ON IMPACT, BE IT EXPANSION JOINTS ALONG BRIDGES OR SMALL IMPERFECTIONS IN THE ROADWAY THAT OTHER CARS HANDLE EVERY DAY.    THE ISSUE IS THAT GM SAYS THESE ARE ROAD HAZARDS AND THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. THE WHEELS WERE NOT ENGINEERED TO TAKE NORMAL DRIVING ON ROADS ANYWHERE.    THIS STARTED IN JUNE AFTER A TRIP I TOOK AND THE CAR PICKED UP A VIBRATION. TOOK IT TO S DEALER AND HE SAID THE WHEELS WERE BENT AND NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND WOULD SELL ME NEW ONES 2 FRONT WHEELS FOR ABOUT $1800. I THEN TOOK THE CAR HOME AND TOOK THE FRONT WHEELS OFF AND HAD THEM STRAIGHTENED AT A COST OF $110 EACH. I THOUGHT THAT TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM SO WE DROVE THE CAR ON ANOTHER TRIP TO NOVA  SCOTIA, CANADA. WE WERE ON A TRIP AND LOST AIR IN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE ( PICTURE BELOW ) IT HAD WORN ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH ALL THE BELTS DUE TO THE WHEELS BEING BENT AGAIN. SEE ALL 3 PICTURES.     THESE WHEELS ARE A SAFETY HAZARD FOR THESE CARS TO USE ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AS THEY DEVELOP CRACKS AND CAUSE SEVERE TIRE WEAR IN SHORT PERIODS OF TIME.     I HAD ANOTHER SET OF BRAND NEW WHEELS AT HOME. I HAD TO COME BACK HOME AND GET THEM AND TAKE THEM BACK TO CANADA TO GET MY CAR HOME. ON THE 1700 MILE TRIP BACK THE CAR DEVELOPED A VIBRATION AND WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO MY TIRE DEALER HE SAID THAT THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL WAS BENT.    THE BIG ISSUE IS GM DOES NOT TRACK THESE ISSUES IF YOU DO NOT BUY THE NEW WHEELS FROM THEM AND IT GOES UNREPORTED. A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS LESS THAN 5000 MILES ON HIS 2019 NEEDS TO BUY 4 WHEELS AND 4 TIRES AND THE DEALER EVEN TOLD US THERE WERE 2 PEOPLE THE WEEK BEFORE THAT HAD BENT RIMS ON I-71.",
