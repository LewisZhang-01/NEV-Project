While in warranty I noticed the dashboard was cracking and took it to the dealer, Four Stars Auto, in Henrietta, Texas. At that time I was told they would order a new dash board and replace it. I took the truck in for replacement of the dash board on the scheduled date.    After the truck was out of warranty the dash board cracked again in the same place. I suspect the dash was repaired and painted and not replaced, but  I have no proof so I did not contact the dealer.   Since that time I have learned this has been an issue with other owners of GM trucks and nothing can be done about it other than replacing the dash, which is a very expensive repair for someone that is retired and on a fixed income. My dash board has now cracked in at least four places and seems to be getting worse. I have heard this could cause issues with the deployment of the airbags, not to mention diminished resale value.",
