AFTER EVERYTHING WAS FIXED BY THE REPAIR SHOP OF MY CHOICE, THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS STILL ON AND COULD NOT BE RESET BECAUSE KIA WILL NOT RELEASE THE CODES TO DO SO.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND $90 LATER SIMPLY RESET THE CODES TO CLEAR THE LIGHT.  NOW I FIND MYSELF WITH THE LIGHT ON AGAIN, AND MY 2002 KIA SEDONA AT THE DEALERSHIP TO FIND OUT WHY.  OF COURSE, IT CANNOT BE AS SIMPLE AS THE CODE NEEDING TO BE RESET, AND I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THERE IS A FAULTY SENSOR IN THE SEATBELT MECHANISM THAT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THIS WILL COST $200 + TO HAVE DONE.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A RECURRENT PROBLEM WITH KIA SEDONAS AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS NOT A RECALL ITEM.  MY SISTER-IN-LAW HAS HAD TO REPLACE THEIRS TWO TIMES NOW, MY FATHER-IN-LAW HAS HAD TO REPLACE HIS AT LEAST ONE TIME, AND MY SISTER-IN-LAWS MOTHER-IN-LAW HAS HAD TO REPLACE HERS AT LEAST TWICE.  THESE ARE JUST FAMILY MEMBERS, AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  ON THIS SITE ALONE I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL, NOT TO MENTION OTHER MESSAGE BOARDS SHOWING THE SAME COMPLAINTS.  AT WHAT POINT DOES A COMPLAINT LIKE THIS GET INVESTIGATED TO BE RECALLED?  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND I IMPLORE YOU TO INVESTIGATE INTO THIS MALFUNCTION.  THANK YOU.  *TR  UPDATED 09/19/07  *TR",

I COMPLAINED OF A WIND NOISE FOR THE FIRST YEAR NO ONE KNEW WHAT IT WAS. IT WENT UNFIXED. WITHIN A YEAR THE SHOCKS, THE STRUTS AND SLIDING DOORS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  MY AIR-CONDITION WENT OUT COMPLETELY GUESS WHAT NO MORE WIND NOISE. AND NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. MY REAR WIPER CONTROL WENT OUT. RECENTLY, WHILE ON THANKSGIVING VACATION TO OHIO WE HAD TO HAVE ROADSIDE PICK UP OUR VAN AS THE TRANSMISSION TOTALLY WENT OUT WITHOUT WARNING.  WHILE IN THE SHOP WE WERE ADVISED OUR BRAKES WERE NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  WE HAD NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. AND THE MOTOR MOUNTS WERE ALSO IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT.  WAS IN THE SHOP 14 DAYS, WE HAD TO DRIVE BACK TO OHIO TO WHEN READY.  THE BRAKES WENT TO THE FLOOR HAD NEVER EVER DONE THAT BEFORE. WHEN WE WERE ON OUR WAY OUT OF TOWN, THE TRANSMISSION WAS ACTING UP.  WE MADE IT HOME ON DEC 7TH AND NO ONE AT KIA COULD TAKE THE VEHICLE IN UNTIL THE SERVICE MANAGER RETURNED MY CALL HE WAS OFF FOR DOCTOR VISIT. ON DEC 13, I TOOK MY VAN IN TO BE REPAIRED, THEY CALLED ME AND TOLD ME IT WOULD NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION, AND GUESS WHAT THEY ARE ALSO REPAIRING THE SLIDING DOORS 5TH TIME I THINK. THEY HAVE TO ALSO FIX THE DENT IN THE HOOD THAT WAS NOT THERE, BEFORE THE OHIO KIA TOOK IT IN TO BE FIXED.  TODAY IT HAS BEEN 15 DAYS.  I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY VAN.

I'M NOT TOPPING OFF THE TANK, I'M EITHER FILLING IT BY HOLDING THE FUEL NOZZLE WITH MY HAND OR USING THE LITTLE CATCH TO HOLD THE FUEL NOZZLE OPEN.  THE VAN HAD A VALVE REPLACED BY THE DEALER IN THE FILLER TUBE BUT THIS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.   AFTER A THIRD TRY TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED AT A DIFFERANT KIA DEALER THE SERVICE ADVISOR HAD ME CALL THE KIA HOTLINE AT 1800-333-4542 AND I WAS TOLD THE SAME THING THAT THE SERVICE ADVISOR HIMSELF HAD BEEN TOLD BY KIA, THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NORMAL FOR THE SEDONA AND HERE IS WHY ACCORDING TO KIA, THE FILLER TUBE FEEDS GAS INTO THE TANK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THEREFORE BUILDING UP PRESSURE INSIDE THE GAS TANK AS IT IS BEING FILLED.  THE SOLUTION: FILL THE TANK UP VERY SLOWLY AS TO NOT BUILD UP PRESSURE INSIDE THE TANK WHILE FILLING.  I'VE OWNED A FEW CARS AND NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT FILLING UP THE TANKS FAST OR SLOW, PUT THE NOZZLE IN THE TANK PUMP THE GAS THE NOZZLE SHUTS OFF WHEN IT'S FULL YOU PAY AND HAVE A NICE DAY.  ANY HELP OR ASSISTANCE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY/DESIGN ISSUE AND WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED OR BUY A SAFER VAN.  MY REFERANCE NUMBER THROUGH KIA IF IT WILL HELP IS 110625.   MR",
