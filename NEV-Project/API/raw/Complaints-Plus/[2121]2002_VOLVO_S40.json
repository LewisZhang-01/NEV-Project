I CALLED THE VOLVO DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT A BULB SHOULD LAST AROUND 2 YEARS.  IN THE NEXT MONTH, MY PASSENGER HEADLIGHT WENT OUT AGAIN. I GOT UNDER THE HOOD TO REPLACE IT AS USUAL. WHEN I PULLED THE BLACK PLASTIC PIECE THAT CONTAINS THE MALE PART TO THE WIRE CONNECTION AND ACTS AS THE BULB SOCKET, IT WAS MELTED. IT WAS MELTED TO THE POINT THAT I COULD NOT GET THE BULB OUT UNTIL I USED PLIERS. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE VOLVO DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE HEADLIGHT COMPARTMENT.  SINCE VOLVO HEADLIGHT COMPARTMENTS ARE \"FACTORY SEALED\", THEY WOULD NOT BREAK THE SEAL. I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW ONE @ $500. I DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I AM NOT PAYING FOR A WHOLE NEW HEADLIGHT COMPARTMENT FOR A PIECE OF PLASTIC THE SIZE OF MY THUMB. TWO DAYS LATER, THE DRIVER SIDE BULB WENT OUT AND IT DID THE SAME EXACT THING, MELTED. THIS LEFT ME WITH NO HEADLIGHTS!  WITHOUT $1000 TO SPEND ON TWO NEW HEADLIGHT COMPARTMENTS (INSTALLED), I DROVE DURING THE DAY.  I FOUND, MYSELF, THAT THE WIRES (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE BLACK PLASTIC SOCKET ARE FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND ARE NOT SHIELDED FROM ONE ANOTHER.  SO, WHEN THE WIRING HARNESS FOR THE HEADLIGHTS WAS PUT TOGETHER, THEY DID NOT PLACE THE WIRES NICE AND NEAT IN THERE TO WHERE THERE WAS NO WAY THEY WOULD TOUCH.  WHEN I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION, I PUT BLACK ELECTRICAL TAPE AROUND THE TWO WIRES (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) IN EACH HEADLIGHT COMPARTMENT SO THAT NOTHING ABOUT THE WIRE WOULD TOUCH AND OBVIOUSLY HAD TO PUT NEW BULBS IN.  THIS HAPPENED DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD WEEK OF AUGUST 2005.  SINCE, I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS.

THE CAR HAD GONE THROUGH AN OIL CHANGE JUST 200 MILES BEFORE.

THE CAR RAN FINE WITHOUT A PROBLEM UNTIL 11/26/05 WHEN THE ENGINE, AT 57,000 MILES BUT OUT OF WARRANTY, BEGAN EMITTING WHITE SMOKE AT THE FRONT AND REAR OF THE CAR.

        "summary": "THERE IS A DANGEROUS REFLECTION OF THE TAUPE DASH OFF THE WINDSHIELD OF MY NEW VOLVO, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE. OTHERS HAVE NOTICED THIS AS WELL: SEE WWW.VOLVOSPY.COM. THIS CREATES A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IN DAYLIGHT, SO MUCH SO THAT THE GLARE IN DAYLIGHT, PRESENT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING AND EVEN ON AN OVERCAST DAY, PREVENTS ONE FROM AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW. THE COMPANY'S RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT WAS OUR VEHICLES MEET OR EXCEED ALL UNITED STATES SPECIFICATIONS FOR SAFETY BRFORE THEY ARE RELEASED TO CUSTOMERS IS THERE A SPECIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF GLARE ALLOWED? FURTHER, THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHEN AND THE WAY I DRIVE, BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DRIVES IN DAYLIGHT HOURS. THE DEALER SUGGESTS THAT I COVER THE DASH WITH A DARK COLORED MATERIAL, WHICH DOES, INDEED, CUT THE GLARE; OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED WEARING POLARIZED SUNGLASSES, WHICH ALSO WORKS. BUT NEITHER OF THESE SUGGESTIONS IS SATISFACTORY, ESPECIALLY IN A NEW CAR. ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM? AND DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS? THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL PROBLEM. THE GLARE IS ALMOST BLINDING AT TIMES. CHECK IT OUT AND SEE WHAT I MEAN. DT",
