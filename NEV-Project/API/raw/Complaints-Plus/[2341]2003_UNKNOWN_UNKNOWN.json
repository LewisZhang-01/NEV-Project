ON SEPTEMBER 14TH 2005 I HAD A LOW SPEED FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE BLOW-OUT.  THE TIRE ACTUALLY COMPLETELY TORE APART ON THE INSIDE WALL OF THE TIRE AT THE TREAD MARGIN.  MY VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE AUDI DEALER AND THEY INDICATED THAT THEY DIDN'T SELL TIRES, THE CLOSEST TIRE STORE ALSO FOUND THAT THE OTHER FRONT TIRE HAD AN UNUSUAL WEAR PATTERN ON THE INSIDE WALL OF THE TIRE AND RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT. THEY TOLD ME MY CAR WAS SEVERELY OUT OF ALIGNMENT, MILEAGE 30,258.  I TOOK MY AUDI BACK TO DESERT AUDI AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING HOW SIGNIFICANT TIRE WEAR WAS NOT NOTED <3 MONTHS AND < 2, 000 MILES BEFORE, THEY ASSESSED THE ALIGNMENT AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO ALIGNMENT PROBLEM AND IN THEIR OPINION I HAD SOME BAD TIRES. NOW THE TIRES WERE THE ORIGINAL TIRES THAT CAME ON THE VEHICLE, DUNLOP HIGH SPEED RATED TIRES SPORT 9090-235/45ZR17-94Y.  THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH TIRES TO PUT ON VEHICLES SOLD OR LEASED IN THE US IN UNDOUBTEDLY WAS MADE BY SOMEONE OR BY A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT; I CERTAINLY WASN'T ASKED WHAT TIRES I WANTED ON MY AUDI.  UPON CONTACTING THE TIRE COMPANY THAT SOMEONE AT AUDI DECIDED TO USE AND ENTRUST THE OVERALL SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE TO, I EXPECTED SOME LEVEL OF SERVICE AND CONCERN OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I MADE NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS (FILE# 792313, DUNLOP TIRE CORP). WAS SENT OVER TO A GOODYEAR TIRE DEALER AND WAS AGAIN TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH MY AUDI.  THE  TIRE CONTRACTOR DUNLOP/GOODYEAR EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE AUDI  FACTORY CERTIFIED TECHNICIANS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CAR ALIGNMENTS AND THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO CHECK MY ALIGNMENT.

WHILE MAKING A TURN,  THE CART LEANED ONTO THE RIGHT HAND TIRE, CAUSING IT TO LOCK UP AND FLIP THE CART ONTO ITS SIDE WITH ENOUGH FORCE THAT IT SNAPPED THE SAFETY CHAIN.  PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT I HAD NOTIFIED THE MANUFACTURER THAT I HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE BECAUSE THE CART WAS RUBBING ON THE WHEELS. THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURED THIS TRAILER TOLD ME ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS THAT HE WOULD COME TO MY RESIDENCE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WELL SOME OTHER DEFECTS; BUT FAILED  TO SHOW UP EACH TIME. THE TRAILER FLIPPED OVER 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE I RECEIVED IT.  APPROXIMATELY 5 DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE COMPANY OWNER SHOWED UP AT MY RESIDENCE AND AGREED IN A HAND WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT IT WAS INDEED A DESIGN ERROR THAT CAUSED THE CART TO BE UNSAFE AND TO FLIP OVER. HE ALSO AGREED IN THIS STATEMENT THAT HE WOULD BUILD ME A NEW CART WITH A WIDER AXLE TO ADDRESS THIS SAFETY ISSUE AND  RECTIFY THE SITUATION. HE HAS SINCE BALKED AT BUILDING ME A NEW CART,AND HAS REFUSED TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRING THE CART I PRESENTLY  OPERATE. HE WILL NOT EVEN TAKE MY PHONE CALLS.

WHILE THESE CHASSIS ARE CERTIFIED BY GM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FMVSS 301, THEIR CERTIFICATION ONLY APPLIES PROVIDED THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE BODY FLOOR DOES NOT EXCEED 110 MM ABOVE THE TOP OF THE FRAME.  THE FLOOR HEIGHT OF BUSES BUILT WITH A FLAT FLOOR ON THESE CHASSIS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS 110 MM.  THUS, SCHOOL BUSES BUILT WITH FLAT FLOORS BUILT UPON THESE CHASSIS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FMVSS 301.  ACCORDING TO MR. TOM VACLAVIK OF UPFITTER INTEGRATION GROUP, THE ONLY SUCH TESTING OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE TO CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH FMVSS 301 OF FLAT FLOOR SCHOOL BUSES MOUNTED ON THESE CHASSIS IS:  1.SHARED TESTING PERFORMED BY A CONSORTIUM OF GIRARDIN, BLUE BIRD, THOMAS, CORBEIL AND GM, COORDINATED BY THE NTEA.  THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS AND MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR COMPLIANCE WAS PROPRIETARY TO THESE PARTICIPANTS.  2.  INDEPENDENT TESTING PERFORMED BY COLLINS BUS.
