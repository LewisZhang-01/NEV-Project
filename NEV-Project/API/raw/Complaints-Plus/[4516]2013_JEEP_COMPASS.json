May 2021, while driving at highway speeds the transmission temperature light illuminated and an un-commanded deceleration occurred to about 10 mph, it would go no faster got to the nearest off ramp and to a rest area sat for an hour, then the vehicle performed normally. May 13, 2021, took the vehicle to the repair facility no trouble codes were set but they replaced the transmission filler tube.  A few days later the light illuminated again but no adverse driving conditions occurred. Oct 18, 2021, at highway speeds the vehicle decelerated to 10 mph a service engine light illuminated a transmission overtempt light also and made it home about ten miles at no more than 10mph, 19 Oct 2021 drove the vehicle at a few mph to my local Jeep dealer for check engine and no power. 22 Nov 2021 they had me pay them $3000.00 and they ordered a transmission. 15 Mar 2022 the transmission arrived they installed it and a transmission cooler and new sparkplugs cleared all troubles, I paid another $3,815.62 and got my vehicle back in good working order. No accidents or injuries were incurred by the sudden decelerations due to our safe driving skills.",

A FAILURE OF THE SAFETY LATCH COULD RESULT IN THE HOOD FLYING OPEN AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD AND POSSIBLY CAUSING A WRECK.  *TR",
