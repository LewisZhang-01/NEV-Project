While driving on highway my 2 children, my daughter friend and myself the vehicle began to drag, I was like oh my God it feels like it's going to cut off. I immediately had a anxiety attack trying to figure out what was happening because no warning lights came on in which had me panic even more. I tried to calm down and get off to side of roadway at least before it did shut off. As soon as I started to drive off to side it shut off I tried to give it gas nothing and the steering wheel had tighten up(no power)so now we was rolling and I'm trying my hardest to steer so we wouldn't hit anything. It was the most scariest moment of my life and my life flashed in front of me and praying no trucks came flying. I proceeded to call AAA they asked my location and if we was in a safe area, did it run out of gas, etc.... They said they will dispatch a tow truck and also tell them to being gas just in case. I said it's by 1/2 tank and say it's 153 miles til empty, they said sometimes those gauge don't work, I said the digital fuel as well would be off.  Well the tow truck came check fluids, batteries and nothing was wrong he put the gas and it started.  This is very dangerous for this gauge to be broken and not operating correctly because it just shut off and had me and my children and friend was in a deadly accident due to a [XXX] malfunction from a defaulted gas reader. What would you people tell our families oh we sorry. This is a serious serious deadly problem that needs to be addressed immediately.\u00a0  Another problem is the suspension and tires. I had everything checked and thought I needed a wheel alignment and I still notice when I hit a bump I'm the road the entire truck swerve. The digital tire air pressure gauge inside car on screen is off and not reading either. The either electrical system is off if you ask me.

THE TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST I CALLED IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WITH MY VEHICLE AS SOON AS I MENTIONED I LOST DRIVE POWER.
