This is not our primary vehicle and, as a result, it only has about 8600 miles.  Stopped at a store for a few minutes. Vehicle would not restart. Many fault lights appeared on the dash (e.g., battery, check engine, EPC). Pushed vehicle into another area of the parking lot where there was more room in case it needed to be towed. Waited a few minutes and tried to restart. Vehicle sputtered and seemed to be running on only 1 or 2 cylinders for a few seconds. Gave it a little gas, all lights went off, full engine power resumed. Sat there a few minutes evaluating engine performance, everything seemed fine.  Decided to head to the dealership instead of going home. After about 2 miles engine stopped running. Many fault lights appeared including battery, EPC, check engine, and so many others I can\u2019t even recall. Had almost no steering. Struggled to coast vehicle to shoulder. Weather was very hot and traffic was heavy, not a pleasant situation or place to get stranded. Waited a minute or two. Tried to restart. Vehicle coughed, sputtered, and shook like it was only running on 1 cylinder. Shut vehicle off and sat. Tried to restart 2 or 3 more times without success. On next attempt vehicle sputtered to life, lights went off, and full power resumed. Tested engine performance and it seemed fine. EPC light came on.  Still heading to the dealership. Got another 1.5 miles or so. EPC and check engine light came on. Another engine failure. Super heavy traffic on a 6-lane highway. Luckily I had enough speed to coast off the road and into a dirt parking lot. Many fault lights on the dash. Waited a few minutes. Tried to restart vehicle, no luck. Vehicle was towed to closest VW dealership.   Absolutely terrifying and horrific 3 hours.",
