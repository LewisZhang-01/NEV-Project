I QUICKLY TURNED THE IGNITION OFF DRIFTED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  I TOOK THE CAR IN TO BE LOOKED AT A SHOP THAT SPECIALIZES IN AUDI/VW CARS.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE A HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS WITH AUDI CARS FOR UNINTENDED ACCELERATION.  THEY BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS IN THE THROTTLE BODY, WHICH CAN FREEZE IN COLD TEMPERATURES.  ACCORDING THE MECHANIC, MOST REPORTED CASES INVOLVE COLD TEMPERATURES AND DRIVING LONG DISTANCES.

I LEARN OF MANY CASES OF THIS EXACT FAILURE IN AUDI??S AND VW??S WITH THE BOSCH 5.3 ABS CONTROL MODULE: ONE PROMINENT SITE BEING HTTP://TECH.BENTLEYPUBLISHERS.COM.    THE DEALERSHIP MAY HAVE MISDIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE CONTROL MODULE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAR??S COMPUTER UPON FAILURE.  ALSO, IT SEEMS THAT THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT FOR SOME PERIOD BEFORE COMPLETE FAILURE.  THE WARNING LIGHTS MAY DISAPPEAR PRIOR TO COMPLETE FAILURE.  IT SEEMS THE FAILURE IS OCCURRING AT SOME POINT BEYOND 60,000 MILES.  THIS WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE RELATIVELY LOW OCCURRENCE, BUT WOULD PORTENT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A MUCH GREAT NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES WITH TIME.    AN UNWARY DRIVER MAY NOT BE COGNIZANT OF THE FAILURE AND THEREFORE NOT EXERCISE THE CAUTION NECESSARY TO AVERT A COLLISION.  ONE FUTURE ISSUE EXACERBATES THAT CONCERN:  THE ABS LIGHT AND THE BRAKE LIGHT WARNING SIGNALS DISAPPEAR UNDER 32 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OR THEREABOUT.  SO, AS WE NEAR WINTER AND THE POSSIBILITY OF INCLEMENT WEATHER, THE CHANCES OF A TRAGEDY INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY.    I HAVE CONTACTED AUDI WITH MY FINDINGS.  AUDI STATED THEY HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF MASS FAILURES.  THEY STATED THAT THEY WILL NOT ACT ON THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE OBTAINED.  THERE ARE COPIOUS POSTINGS ON THE INTERNET IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CONTACTED AUDI.  SURPRISINGLY, SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS PROFESS THAT AUDI PAID FOR THE REPAIR IN CASES OF OUT-OF-WARRANTY, HIGH-MILEAGE VEHICLES.    I BELIEVE THAT AN AUDIT OF THE NUMBER OF THE BOSCH 5.3 ABS CONTROL MODULES BEING ORDER AS REPLACEMENT PARTS WILL ILLUMINATE THE GRAVITY OF THIS PROBLEM.  *NM",

AFTER STARTING THE CAR AND TURNING IT OFF 3 TIMES, I FINALLY DISENGAGED THE CRUISE CONTROL AND MADE IT TO MY DESTINATION.  ON THE WAY HOME, WITHOUT TOUCHING ANY CRUISE CONTROL FEATURES, THE THROTTLE ONCE AGAIN BECAME STUCK AND WAS TRYING TO ACCELERATE THE CAR.

CAN THIS BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY VIOLATION?  ATTEMPTED RESOLUTION: AUDI OF AMERICA'S RESPONSE WAS THAT A/C HAS TO BE TURNED ON FOR RECIRCULATION BUTTON TO BE OPERATIONAL.  SINCE A/C DOES NOT WORK BELOW 38 F (THEY CITED SOME FEDERAL REGULATION) SO THE RECIRCULATION BUTTON DOES NOT AS WELL.  THE DEVICE WORKS AS DESIGNED, ACCORDING TO AUDI.  MY DEALER, TOM WALTON OF PARK PORSCHE AUDI, TOLD ME CONFIDENTIALLY THAT THEY HAVE CUSTOMERS WHO DID NOT WANT TO PURCHASE AUDI A4 UNTIL THESE PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED.  I FILED A REPORT WITH AUDIO OF AMERICA TWICE.  THERE WAS NO FOLLOW UP EITHER TIME.   MEANWHILE DEALER\u0012S SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT THEY INQUIRED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND WERE TOLD THAT DEVICE OPERATES AS DESIGNED.  THE SAME YEAR I RENTED EXACTLY THE SAME VEHICLE IN GERMANY AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT A/C ASSEMBLY INSTALLED, AND THAT RECIRCULATION BUTTON WORKED WELL IN TEMPERATURES BELOW 20 F.  IN U.S., THE SAME A/C ASSEMBLY BECAME AVAILABLE WITH THE 2000 MODEL YEAR, WHERE THIS PROBLEM IS NOT PRESENT.  I ASKED THE DEALER IF I COULD PAY TO HAVE THAT A/C ASSEMBLY INSTALLED BUT WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE.
