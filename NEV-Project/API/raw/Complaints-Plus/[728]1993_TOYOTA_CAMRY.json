        "summary": "1.  APRIL 2, 2009.  WE WERE DRIVING ON I-68 E LESS THAN 100 FROM OUR DESTINATION OF WASHINGTON, DC.  WE WERE DRIVING AROUND THE HILLS THERE AND SUDDENLY, THE CAR STARTED TO ACCELERATE UNINTENTIONALLY.  THE BRAKES WERE PRESSED TO THE FLOOR BUT IT DIDN'T SLOW THE CAR BUT DID HELP SO THAT CAR DIDN'T ACCELERATE MORE THAN THE 75+MPH IT HAD ACCELERATED TO FROM 60-65MPH.  WE TRIED TO TURN THE CRUISE CONTROL ON AND OFF THINKING IT WAS A COMPUTER ISSUE BUT IT DIDN'T HELP AND IT WAS ON WHEN THE INCIDENT BEGAN.  WE TRIED GOING INTO NEUTRAL BUT IT JUST REVVED THE ENGINE UP INTO THE RED, BUT FROM THERE WE WERE GOING TO PUT IT IN PARK, BUT GOING FROM NEUTRAL TO PARK WE PASSED THROUGH REVERSE AND SINCE THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING WE STARTED TAKING OFF IN REVERSE.  WELL WE ENDED UP PERPENDICULAR TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC COMING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN, BUT GOT THE ENGINE TURNED OFF.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE THROTTLE GOT STUCK, THE WIRE OVER THE SPRING MECHANISM THAT PULLS THE THROTTLE WIRE BACK IF YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE PEDAL.  IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE RETRACTING MECHANISM AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY INCIDENTS SINCE.  2.  THIS HAPPENED ONCE ON THE DATE ABOVE.  IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.  WE OR OTHER CAR PASSENGERS COULD HAVE DIED GOING AT THAT SPEED AND WITH THE LIMITED VISIBILITY FROM DRIVING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN/HILL.  3.  THE THROTTLE WIRE WAS REMOVED FROM OVER THE RETRACTING MECHANISM.  THE TIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE SKIDDING DONE WHILE BRAKING.  I NOW CHECK THE THROTTLE WIRE REGULARLY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS PASSING AND NOT OBSTRUCTED.  THE BRAKES WERE CHECKED BUT THEY ARE GOOD.  I SAW THAT SOME NEWER TOYOTAS WERE RECALLED FOR ACCELERATING RELATED TO FLOOR MATS, BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR.  IN THE LA TIMES I SAW AN ARTICLE ABOUT THIS FAILURE AND I HOPE TO ADD TO THE DATA AVAILABLE. *TR",
