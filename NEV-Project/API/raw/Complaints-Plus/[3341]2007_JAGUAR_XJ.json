WE HAD TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT SIDE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT OF ANOTHER VEHICLE WE HAD JUST PASSED AND OTHER TRAFFIC COMING CLOSE BEHIND.  DEFINITELY A SCARY SITUATION FOR US AND THE OTHER DRIVERS.  WE WERE TOWED TO THE NEAREST JAG DEALER. THE DEALER HAD OUR CAR FOR TWO WEEKS.  THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP.  THE SERVICE TECH'S TOLD US THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF A FUEL PUMP GOING BAD IN AN X-TYPE.  WHEN I QUESTIONED THE COST OF THE JOB, ABOUT $1450, I WAS TOLD THAT THE FUEL TANK HAD TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP.  SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE HAD A BATTERY REPLACED, THE SECOND FOR THIS CAR SINCE WE HAVE OWNED IT, AND HAD TO HAVE BRAKE PADS REPLACED, AT WHICH TIME, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE REAR BRAKES HAD A PROBLEM IN THE CALIPERS THAT CAUSED THE PADS TO SIT FURTHER FROM THE DISCS THAN THEY SHOULD.  THIS BRAKE PROBLEM CAUSES US TO USE EXTRA PEDAL TRAVEL WHEN BRAKING THE CAR.  THEN, ON DEC 9, 2013, THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL FELL OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF OUR CAR.  WE WERE ONLY DOING ABOUT 20 MPH SO THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT, BUT WE HAD TO BE TOWED TO A JAG DEALER ABOUT 30 MILES AWAY.  MY RESEARCH FOUND THAT WHEN THE FUEL TANK IS REMOVED, THE DIFFERENTIAL WOULD ALSO BE REMOVED.  THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE SERVICE WRITER WHERE MY JAG WAS TOWED.  ONE OF THE DIFFERENTIALS BOLTS BROKE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CRACKED, AS IF IT HAD BEEN OVER TORQUED WHEN INSTALLED!  THE SERVICE WRITER ASKED TO SEE THE WORK ORDER FOR THE FUEL PUMP WORK, SO I ASKED HIM TO LOOK IT UP.  HE WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND THE INFO, BECAUSE THE WORK WAS DONE OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE JAG SYSTEM DOES NOT RECORD OUT OF WARRANTY WORK!  THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THE TECHS NEVER HEARD OF A FUEL PUMP GOING BAD OR A DIFFERENTIAL FALLING OUT OF A JAG CAR, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EXAMPLES OF BOTH REPORTED HERE!   *TR",

DEALERSHIP REPLACED ORIGINAL CAR BREAK PADS WITH FAULTY PADS TO DAMAGE ROTORS AND HAVE ME AS A CUSTOMER PAY FOR A SERVICE THAT IS NOT WARRANTED. CAR ALSO CAME BACK FROM DEALERSHIP WITH AN ENGINE TICK AND TIRE GRINDING SOUND THAT IT NEVER HAD, DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT'S NORMAL TO GET OUT OF ENGINE INSPECTION WHEN THESE SOUNDS ARE NEW SOUNDS THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED. GAS CAP FILLER CAME CRACKED AT TIME OF PURCHASE, CAR WAS TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP FOR THAT REPLACEMENT, CAR WAS BRAND NEW WITH THIS DEFECT EXISTING AT TIME OF PURCHASE. CAR LEATHER SEATS ARE DETERIORATING, FADING, PEELING, CHIPPING AND CRACKING. PASSENGER SIDE VISOR SNAPPED OFF. DRIVING TRACTION STABILITY LIGHT COMES ON AND OFF WITH OUT BEING SWITCHED ON. CAR FEELS LIKE IT HAS NO SHOCKS, CAR RIDES OVER SMALL RODE BUMP AND FEELS LIKE IT RAN INTO A BIG WHOLE IN THE RODE, WHEN PAVEMENT IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH, DEALER SAYS SHOCKS ARE FINE, BUT THE CAR DID NOT HAVE THIS EFFECT UNTIL IT CAME OUT OF SERVICE FOR THE DEFECTIVE TRANSFER CASE. *TR",
