TWO WEEKS LATER THE NOISE RETURNED LOUDER AND WHEN I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, THEY FOUND NO REAR BRAKE PAD ON RIGHT REAR WHEEL AND MY ROTOR WAS COMPLETELY RUINED. MY FRONT BRAKE PADS WERE FINE AND WAS GIVEN NO EXPLANATION BY HONDA WHY THIS COULD'VE OCCURRED. HONDA WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY AND I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD EXACT SAME PROBLEM OCCURRING AROUND THE SAME MILEAGE. I RECENTLY HEARD THAT HONDA HAS RECALLED ACCORDS OF THE SAME YEAR FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT NOT MY MODEL OR YEAR. I'M APPALLED AT THE AUDACITY OF HONDA TO IGNORE THE SAME PROBLEMS FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER ON DIFFERENT MODELS. CLEARLY HONDA IS AWARE OF THEIR FAULTY ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS AND CHOOSES TO  OVERLOOK THIS PROBLEM. I DID NOT EXPECT TO PAY 400.00 FOR A PROBLEM OF THIS MAGNITUDE FOR A CAR WELL MAINTAINED WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE.  I INTEND TO GO AFTER HONDA TO BE FULLY RE-IMBURSED FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE. *TR",

        "summary": "I AM AN OWNER OF A 2008 HONDA ELEMENT WHICH RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A MEDIA RELEASE FROM HONDA THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH BRAKE FAILURE.  ONE YEAR AGO I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH YOU REGARDING BRAKE FAILURE ON MY ELEMENT. THE DEALER AT THAT TIME FOUND THAT I HAD VERY SPONGY BRAKES AND AIR BUBBLES IN THE LINE BUT COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ANSWER OF WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN AND NOT GUARANTEE THAT IT COULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.  I HAVE WORRIED CONSTANTLY ABOUT THIS  AND SO I STILL CONTINUED TO FEEL THE SPONGY BRAKES SO I TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER THAT CHECKED OUT AND SAID THAT  IS JUST THE WAY HONDA ELEMENT BRAKES ARE.  SO 2 MONTHS AGO THE BRAKES WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR AGAIN ( I HAVE TO PUMP THEM QUICKLY SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY FINALLY GRAB)  I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY ONCE AGAIN CHECKED IT AND FOUND NOTHING, WELL SINCE THIS MEDIA RELEASE CAME OUT THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A RECALL ON 410,000 HONDA VEHICLES I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER HE WAS VERY APOLOGETIC AND SAID THAT WAS EXACTLY MY VEHICLE, AND AGREED WITH ME THAT IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL THEY GET THE PARTS TO REPAIR IT; HE HAD ME CALL HONDA AN THEY TREATED ME VERY VERY RUDELY THEY TOLD ME JUST TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THEM I ALREADY HAD AND THAT IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE SINCE I'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WON'T GIVE ME A RENTAL CAR AND JUST KEPT REPEATING TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER. THEY SAID THAT I COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT MY VEHICLE HAD THIS MALFUNCTION. I'M VERY FRUSTRATED THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE ON THE ROAD AND EVEN THE DEALER AGREES WITH ME ,IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT HONDA BASICALLY JUST DOES NOT CARE AND THEY TREATED ME LIKE I'M MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS.

I RETURNED TO FLORIDA IN LATE FEBRUARY 2009 AND TOOK THE CAR TO BLOUNT HONDA IN LEESBURG, FL FOR 6000 MILE CHECKUP IN EARLY MARCH. I ASKED THEM TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE BRAKES. AS I WAS WAITING FOR THE CAR, THE MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT THEIR WAS ROTOR DISTORTION CAUSED BY THE CAR SITTING, THE ROTORS WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED, AND IT WAS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. THE CAR DID SIT FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS WHILE IN MY POSSESSION BUT I DISMISSED THIS AS THE CAUSE AS THE BRAKE PROBLEM WAS NOTICED THE INSTANT I GOT THE CAR IN SEPTEMBER 2008. IT WOUND UP COSTING ME $160.00 TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT THE CAR WAS RECEIVED BY JAY HONDA DEALER IN JANUARY 2008 AND THEY HAD IN  THEIR POSSESSION FOR ALMOST NINE MONTHS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH AMERICAN HONDA WHO SAID THAT IT WAS UP TO THE SELLING DEALER TO REIMBURSE ME. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY WOULD NOT. *TR",
