IT STARTED WITH NEEDING TO REPLACE THE LIGHTS EVERY QUARTER. NOW, I REPLACE THE BRAKE LIGHTS AT LEAST EVERY 1-4 WEEKS. THE LIGHT EITHER HAS BECOME SO HOT AND BLOWN OUT, OR WHEN I HIT A SLIGHT BUMP IN THE ROAD -- THE LIGHT DISLODGES. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND THEY HAVE SURMISED THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT RELATED TO ELECTRICAL WIRING, BUT THEY BELIEVE THE SOCKET IS NOT HOLDING THE BULB SNUGLY TO RETAIN LIGHTING. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE INABILITY FOR OTHER DRIVERS TO KNOW THAT I AM BRAKING. THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE THAT BOTH BRAKE LIGHTS WENT OUT AT NIGHT. AS A RESULT, I CARRY A SPARE PACKET OF TAILLIGHT BULBS IN MY VEHICLE AT ALL TIMES. I INTEND TO RETURN TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 10/15/2020 TO REQUEST ANOTHER REPAIR TO THE LIGHT AND TO PURCHASE A NEW TAILLIGHT ASSEMBLY.

I ENDED UP COASTING TO THE SHOULDER BECAUSE MY ENGINE ABRUPTLY LOST POWER AND TRIED STALLING. SINCE I KNEW MY BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATED WITH VACUUM ASSIST, I TAPPED THE GAS PEDAL TO KEEP THE ENGINE RUNNING AND HAD TO DOUBLE FOOT THE PEDALS TO BRAKE AND KEEP THE ENGINE FROM STALLING. AFTER I STOPPED ON THE SHOULDER, THE ENGINE FINALLY DIED WHILE RATTLING EVEN HARDER. I TRIED STARTING THE ENGINE AGAIN, AND IT DID START, STILL RATTLING AND KNOCKING, SO I SHUT IT OFF. THE ENGINE HADN'T YET SEIZED UP. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM, PER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY (NON-KIA DEALER). THEY WERE HAPPY TO HELP, BUT RECOMMENDED TALKING TO KIA AS A FIRST STEP. I DID SO, AND THEY DID OFFER TO TOW MY CAR TO THEIR OWN DEALERSHIP, NO CHARGE TO ME, SO THEY COULD INSPECT THE DAMAGE. I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT POTENTIALLY GETTING KIA MOTORS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE IF NEEDED, ON THEM, FREE TO ME. THIS DEALERSHIP IS ONE OF TWO IN MY CITY, AND THEY ARE THE NICER OF THE TWO IN TERMS OF CUSTOMER RELATIONS. I HAVE DEALT WITH EACH DEALER FOR VARIOUS REASONS OVER THE YEARS, AND THAT HAS BEEN MY CONSENSUS. I WILL BE WAITING TO SEE WHAT COMES OF THIS ISSUE, BUT THESE CARS THAT CAME WITH THE 2.4 ENGINE NEED TO BE ADDED TO HYUNDAI/KIA'S 2.4 ENGINE RECALL INSTEAD OF IGNORED.",

AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE IN AUGUST 2018, THE DEALERSHIP SERVICED THE VEHICLE (OIL CHANGE, ETC.). WE HAD ANOTHER OIL CHANGE AND OVERVIEW OF THE VEHICLE SINCE THEN.      ALL WAS WORKING FINE UNTIL FEBRUARY 11,2019 WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE WHEN VEHICLE WAS IN IDLE AND INCREASES WHEN SHIFTED INTO DRIVE. ON FEBRUARY 12, I TOOK THE CAR TO OUR AUTO REPAIR SHOP. THEY DETERMINED THE INTERNAL ENGINE NEAR THE REAR IS WHERE THE KNOCKING NOISE WAS COMING FROM. THIS WOULD TAKE A REBUILD OR REPLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE. I CALLED A LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS AND THEY SAID THERE WERE NO RECALLS AND ALL WORK WOULD BE BILLABLE. I HAVE NOT HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST AND WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT TAKING THIS CAR THERE. THIS IS WHY I DID NOT TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. I HAVE A TRUSTED AUTO REPAIR SHOP THAT GIVES ME HONEST AND TIMELY ADVICE AND RESULTS.     I HAVE CONTACTED KIA MOTORS AMERICA, INC ALREADY AND AM HOPING THAT MY COMMUNICATING WITH KIA MOTORS AMERICA, INC. DIRECTLY WILL HELP TO GIVE ME THE SUPPORT THEY ADVERTISE TO CUSTOMERS ON ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES. KIA CLAIMS TO BACK UP THE QUALITY OF THEIR VEHICLES.

AFTER THE CAR WAS DIAGNOSED THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, THEY SAID WHEN THE CAR WAS BUILT A FEW PARTS IN THE ENGINE WERE PUT IN INCORRECTLY WHICH CAUSED MY ENGINE TO BASICALLY OVER HEAT AND START TO FALL APART.

AFTER THE CAR STALLED ON ME I COULD NOT GO ABOVE 30MPH NO MATTER HOW HARD I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL.  I HAD TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY HOME ON THE FREEWAY WITH THE HAZARD LIGHTS ON GOING 30MPH.
