THE VOLVO SPECIALIST EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IN RECENT YEARS VOLVO HAD MADE A CHANGE TO HOW THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS COOLED.  AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS DESIGN CHANGE TO AWD VEHICLES (ALL AWD'S) THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS COOLED BY FLOWING THROUGH A PIPE DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO THE RADIATOR.  OVER TIME THE RADIATOR FLUID CAUSED THE COOLING PIPE TO CORRODE AND AS A RESULT RADIATOR FLUID WAS LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION FLUID CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL.  BESIDES REBUILDING THE TRANSMISSION THE RADIATOR ALSO REQUIRED REPLACEMENT BECAUSE WE HAD TO FIX THE LEAK AT THE SOURCE OR IT WOULD CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.
