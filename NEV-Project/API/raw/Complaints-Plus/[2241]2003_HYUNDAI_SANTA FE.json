I SEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THE VEHICLE WAS ONE THAT HAS HAD A WARRANTY EXTENSION ON THE FUEL TANK, WHICH IS 15 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. MY FUEL LIGHT WAS ON INDICATING MY FUEL LEVEL WAS LOW. I LIVE 15 MILES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST HYUNDAI DEALER SO I WAS TAKING IT IN TO HAVE IT INSPECTED BY A CERTIFIED HYUNDAI DEALER. I FILLED UP MY TANK WITH $7.00 OF GAS ($2.70/GAL). AFTER FUELING I GOT INTO MY CAR AND STARTED THE CAR. I NOTICED THE FUEL GAUGE HAD NOT MOVED AFTER FUELING. I PROCEEDED TO FILL UP THE CAR UNTIL FULL. SINCE IT IS NOT SAFE BECAUSE I CAN SEE THE FILE LEAKING, I CANNOT PARK ON MY PROPERTY AND PARKED ON THE STREET, AS FAR AWAY FROM OTHER HOUSES. IT DID NOT FEEL SAFE ON A PUBLIC STREET, IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, JUST SITTING THERE BECAUSE THE POSSIBILITY OF IT CATCHING ON FIRE AND EXPLODING IN FLAMES. WHAT IF A DRIVER FLICKED OUT A CIGARETTE AND IT ROLLED UNDER MY VEHICLE, CATCHING IT AND ANYTHING AROUND IT ON FIRE? I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AFTER FILLING IT WITH A FULL TANK OF GAS. WHILE DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE VEHICLE STARTED LOOSING POWER. I PULLED OFF ONTO THE NEAREST EXIT AND IT DIED, OIL LIGHT, BATTERY LIGHT, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON (ETC). CARS BEHIND ME WHERE HONKING DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. ABLE TO GET IT STARTED AGAIN AND DECIDED TO TRY TO GET HOME AGAIN. VEHICLE LOST POWER AGAIN & DIED, THIS TIME NOT RESTARTING, EVEN AFTER SITTING 12 HOURS. I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER. HYUNDAI IS STATING I AM OUTSIDE OF THE MILES ALLOWANCE. WHY IS THIS NOT A MANDATORY RECALL? THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD' EVEN WHEN PARKED! TIME/MILEAGE SHOULDN'T MATTER. MANY OTHERS LIKE MINE.",

IT WAS MOODY AND INTERMITTENT, NOT CONSTANT AND DANGEROUS. THE DEALER STILL COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM! THEN ONE DAY I PLACED THE VEHICLE INTO REVERSE AND IT JERKED BACK HARD!!

I WASN'T HAVING ANY PROBLEMS, JUST WANTED TO BE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OK.  SERVICE TECH RECOMMENDED TRANSMISSION FLUSH, REPLACEMENT OF TIMING BELT, & REPLACEMENT OF CRANK SENSOR.  I AGREED TO RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE I WANT TO DRIVE A SAFE & RELIABLE VEHICLE.  SINCE MAY I HAVE RETURNED TO SERVICE DEPT. AT LEAST 4 TIMES BECAUSE THE VEHICLE NOW STALLS WHILE I'M DRIVING, NO WARNING, JUST QUITS. IT STARTS BACK UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES. THESE EVENTS ARE INTERMITTENT. THE FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 15 & 55 MPH, WHILE A/C ON, OUTDOOR TEMP 80+ & HUMID.  SOMETIMES FAILURE OCCURS WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, OTHER TIMES AT HIGHER SPEED ON HWY.   SERVICE TECH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DUPLICATE OR GET A READ ON THE PROBLEM.  HE HAS EVEN DRIVEN THE VEHICLE HOME & BACK  (60 MI) AT LEAST TWICE, STATING HE HAD NO PROBLEMS.    EACH VISIT I AM TOLD \"NO PROBLEM FOUND\" YET FAILURES PERSIST.  HYUNDAI USA HAS ADVISED ME IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, HAVE IT TOWED TO DEALERSHIP SO THEY MAY DIAGNOSE/DUPLICATE  THE PROBLEM.

DO SANTA FE DRIVERS HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE HYUNDAI MAKES THIS ISSUE A PRIORITY?  I HAVE READ MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ONLINE, SOME DATING BACK TO LATE 2003.  ALMOST ALL MENTION BEING TOLD ITS A PROBLEM WITH CRANK SENSOR OR RELATED COMPONENTS. ALSO, HYUNDAI APPARENTLY DID RECALL 2001 & 2002 MODELS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROBLEMS. MY VEHICLE DIDN'T STALL UNTIL THE CRANK SENSOR WAS REPLACED, COULD BE A COINCIDENCE, BUT I DON'T THINK SO.  BESIDES THE SAFETY ISSUE, THIS IS A FINANCIAL RIP-OFF.  $90/HR LABOR ADDS UP QUICKLY.

I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP AND HAD THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR REPLACED, THE VEHICLE NOW STARTS.

I PRESSED HARDER ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, RELEASED THE PEDAL, PRESSED IT AGAIN, BUT NOTHING I DID KEPT MY CAR FROM CONTINUING TO PROPEL ITSELF DOWNHILL. I NEARLY SIDES WIPED A PARKED CAR BECAUSE, AS MY SPEED INCREASED, THE SANTA FE SLID OUT OF CONTROL ON THE SNOW. ONLY BY SOME MIRACLE WAS THE REST OF THIS BUSY NEIGHBORHOOD STREET EMPTY. I FINALLY REGAINED CONTROL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. AFTER THAT INCIDENT, THE BRAKES WORKED FINE. BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS DANGEROUS FAILURE HAD OCCURRED.  AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PATTERN OF THIS PROBLEM: ONE OR MORE INCIDENTS ON A WET OR SNOWY DAY FOLLOWED BY NORMAL OPERATION. IN APRIL OF 2004, THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM DEVELOPED. ANY TIME I TRIED TO STOP ON A WET OR SNOWY STREET, THE BRAKES WOULD SLOW THE CAR, BUT NOT STOP IT COMPLETELY. AT THAT TIME, HYUNDAI DID FIND A PROBLEM.

THEY ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE ABS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. I AM CERTAIN THAT MY BRAKES WILL FAIL AGAIN, BUT UNTIL MY HYUNDAI DEALER SAYS THERE IS A PROBLEM, THEY'D LIKE ME TO BELIEVE THERE ISN'T ONE.

I WAS CHARGED ANOTHER $19.95 BUT AGAIN, SERVICE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A PROBLEM. AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE HISTORY OF SERVICE ON THIS NEW VEHICLE, I CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS SERVICED IN APRIL 2004 AS A RESULT OF A RECALL NOTICE I RECEIVED (RECALL NO. 065 - ABS REPROGRAMMING).

HECU REPROGRAMMING\", THE SUMMARY AND DESCRIPTION OF CONSEQUENCE LISTED IN YOUR NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 04V131000 IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DATE OF MY ACCIDENT. THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, I HAD MY VEHICLE THROUGH A CAR WASH. NEITHER HYUNDAI DEALER QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BRAKE PAD MAY HAVE BEEN WET AND/OR ACKNOWLEDGED THAT JUST OVER A YEAR EARLIER, THIS VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT IN UNDER A RECALL INVOLVING THE ABS, THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCE OCCURRING AND A POSSIBLE CRASH RESULTING. IN NOVEMBER 2004 (AFTER THE RECALL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED), THE VEHICLE AGAIN DISPLAYED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALER, SERVICE COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY PROBLEMS ON INSPECTION. THE EVENTS AND HISTORY LEADING TO THE CURRENT FAILURE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE PREVIOUS RECALL WORK PERFORMED WAS NOT EFFECTIVE.

THE FIRST CAR WAS TRAVELING AT A  HIGHER RATE OF SPEED THAN WHAT THE ELEMENTS CALLED FOR, HITTING THE SECOND CAR AND SHOOTING THE CAR INTO OURS, BROADSIDING TOM ON HIS DRIVER'S SIDE.  TOM IMMEDIATELY HEARD A SNAP.   HE SUSTAINED BROKEN RIBS, A TORN MENISCUS , AND A HERNIATED DISC IN HIS C5/C6.   (HIS FIRST SURGERY IS COMPLETE, WE ARE AWAITING  THE SECOND.)   THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR WAS ENOUGH TO REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $8,400.00.  DURING THE ACCIDENT, THE SIDE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY WANTED A RAPID REPAIR.  WE NEVER THOUGHT TO GET ENGINEERS OUT TO LOOK AT THE DAMAGE OR TO TAKE PICTURES.  WE DID LEARN THAT THERE HAD BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG AND SENSOR FROM THE BODY SHOP AND  THEY SAID THEY  WOULD RETAIN THE COMPONENTS SO THAT HYUNDAI COULD VIEW THEM.  I WROTE TO HYUNDAI  ON APRIL 14, 2004.  A REPRESENTATIVE CONTACTED US  THE FIRST TIME IN JUNE AND THEN ON JUNE 22, 2004, HE CALLED AGAIN ASKING FOR THE NAME OF THE REPAIR SHOP.  TOM GAVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  THE REPRESENTATIVE CALLED US BACK AND TOLD TOM THAT THE REPAIR SHOP HAD GOTTEN RID OF THE PARTS.  THAT WAS A SHOCK TO US BECAUSE UP UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY TOLD US THEY WOULD RETAIN IT.  (WE CONFIRMED THIS WITH THEM WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE FIRST MADE CONTACT WITH US.)  IN ADDITION, FROM WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD TOM, THE STORY CHANGED  ABOUT THE DEFECTIVE PARTS.  I DO NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF WHAT OCCURRED.  SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.  I WANT ANSWERS.  I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE MALFUNCTION HAPPENED.  WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME  OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS ONGOING AND NOBODY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO.  MY HUSBAND SUSTAINED MAJOR  INJURIES.
