I've had non stop problems with the car and until now I didn't know it was a recall problem.  My gear shift linkage has went out stuck in gear. My water pump has gone out . It's overheated on numberous occasions smells like a electrical fire happening. The car won't start it stalls out all the time at least two times a day. The website says that my car has already received the recalls but the exact problems they have listed are the exact problems I'm having and it's a safety hazard for real. They told me I was going to have to pay to get it fixed since my car already received the recalls. I don't think this is fair I think that if they \"fixed\" it then it shouldn't be a problem now but it is so it seems like the \"fix\" didn't work I need help being pointed in the right direction of who can look at this and really fix it please",

WHEN I ASKED WHY THE SENSOR LIGHT WAS ON I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT, JUST THE AIR PRESSURE ON THE TIRES DUE TO LEAKAGE, AND ALL IT NEEDED WAS A CAP ON THE VALVE STEM. THE CAPS ON THE VALVE STEMS OF TWO WHEELS WERE REPLACED BUT THE LIGHT STAYED ON. A FEW DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE, I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 66 MPH WHEN THE CAR STARTED JERKING AS IF THE FUEL WAS GASPING; IT SCARED ME TO DEATH! TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PURCHASE, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, AND WOULDN'T GO OFF; THE CAR MUST BE TAKEN IN FOR DIAGNOSTIC WHICH I'M TOLD WILL COST ALMOST $100 TO FIND OUT WHY THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT ON AND THE OTHER LIGHT BLINKING, SO THE CAR WILL JUST SET IN THE PARKING AREA UNTIL I CAN RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE $250 DEDUCTIBLE ON THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I PURCHASED FOR $1,500, AND THE PROBLEM MAY NOT EVEN BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. ALSO, FIRST THE DEALER SOLD ME THE CAR WITHOUT A KEY FOB WHICH I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL THE HORN STARTED HONKING AND LIGHTS STARTED FLASHING WHEN I UNLOCKED THE DOOR TO GET BACK INTO THE CAR A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE. THE SALES PERSON TOLD ME I COULD GET ONE MADE AT A DISCOUNT, BUT WHEN I WENT BACK TO PURCHASE IT I WAS TOLD I WAS MISTAKEN. AFTER SHOPPING AROUND IT COST ME OVER $100 TO GET ONE MADE (THOUGH THE DEALER WOULD HAVE CHARGED ME OVER $200.)",

PUSHED THE PINK PLASTIC PIECE IN & IT ALLOWED ME TO SWITCH GEARS WHEN IT WAS HELD IN BUT I AM STILL UNABLE TO CRANK MY CAR & EVEN WHEN THE GEARS ARE SWITCHED THE DASHBOARD SAYS THE CAR IS STILL IN REVERSE. LOOKED UP RECALLS & SURE ENOUGH THERE IS A RECALL BUT OF COURSE WHEN I ENTERED MY CAR INFORMATION IT DOESN'T APPLY TO MY CAR.  I ALSO HAVE REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR 4 TIMES IN 3 YEARS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS A POOR DESIGN THAT CAUSES THE ALTERNATOR TO WEAR DOWN & LOCK UP SO QUICKLY.  I WILL EVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYSTLER DODGE VEHICLE IN MY LIFE. THIS CAR HAS BY FAR BEEN THE WORST INVESTMENT OF MY LIFE. I REALLY HOPE SOMETHING HAPPENS TO GET THESE CARS OFF OF THE ROAD FOREVER BEFORE THEY END UP KILLING SOMEONE DUE TO THE HIGHLY POOR DESIGN OF EVERYTHING IN THEM!",

I'VE HAD IT SEEN THERE BEFORE AND THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WHEN I PAID OVER $500 FOR REPAIR WORK. I'M FEARFUL FOR MY LIFE WHILE DRIVING AND ITS CAUSED ME MUCH STRESS AND ANXIETY. I'VE SPOKE TO SEVERAL OTHER AVENGER OWNERS THAT EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEMS IN WHICH THEIR ONLY OPTION WAS TO TRADE IT IN BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE. I PERSONALLY WOULD JUNK IT MYSELF BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER WANT TO JEOPARDIZE ANOTHER PERSON OR THEIR CHILDREN'S LIFE, HOWEVER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I CAN'T AFFORD IT AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO TRADE THE \"PROBLEM\" DOWN TO SOME UNKNOWING OF THE RISKS AND DANGERS OF THE VEHICLE.

WHILE DRIVING OUR 2008 AVENGER, THERE WAS A RAPID DECELERATION THAT OCCURRED ACCOMPANIED BY THE ETC LIGHT COMING ON AND FLASHING. I APPLIED GAS AND NOTHING HAPPENED, THEN A SPLIT SECOND LATER, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED, ETC LIGHT WENT OUT. I SLOWLY ACCELERATED TO 55 MPH AND NOTICED THAT THE RPMS WERE HIGHER THAN USUAL (3200) FOR THE SPEED AND ALSO FELT A HICCUP OR CUTTING OUT FEEL. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD LOST 4TH GEAR? MY HUSBAND AND I ARE SEASONED AUTO SERVICE ADVISORS & ARE VERY MUCH IN TUNE WITH OUR VEHICLES. ALONG WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES, NOW AT FREEWAY SPEEDS, RPM'S WILL DROP; WHILE THE ENGINE FEELS AS IF IT WILL CUT OFF & ETC LIGHT COMES ON, THEN GOES OUT. I HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH & FOUND ON THIS NHTSA WEBSITE, APPROX. 90% OF COMPLAINTS FOR LIKE VEHICLES TO BE EXACT OR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING. I STOPPED LOOKING AFTER 5 PAGES.(95% OF 1ST 5 PAGES ARE FILLED WITH LIKE CONCERNS). I WILL BE CONTACTING THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION AS WELL. WHY AN OFFICIAL RECALL HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED, BEFUDDLES ME.

AFTER VERY THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS ON MY OWN, IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME ISSUE AND THE DEALERS ARE REPLACING FUEL FILLER NECKS AND COMPLETE FUEL TANKS WHERE THE WHOLE ISSUE IS CAUSED BY A FUEL SAFETY ROLLOVER VALVE LOCATED WITHIN THE FUEL SYSTEM.  THIS IS NO JOKING MATTER.   NONE OF THESE REPAIRS SHOULD HOLD THE OWNERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTLY REPAIRS OF THE FAULTY FUEL SYSTEM WITH SUCH NUMEROUS REPORTS OF FAILURE.  *TR",

I AM A POLICE OFFICER AND I HAVE DEFENSIVELY DRIVING TRAINING BUT THEY DON'T TRAIN YOU ON WHEN A PART ON YOUR CAR THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED FAILS WHILE TRAVELING 65 ON THE FREEWAY. HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DO THEY NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM? YOU WILL RECALL A STUPID TIRE SENSOR BUT NOT THE THROTTLE BODY THAT CAN CAUSE DEATH? FIX THE PROBLEM PLEASE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE OR INJURED BECAUSE NO ONE IS LISTENING ABOUT AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM. *TR",

ON THE 24TH OF JUNE 2011 I DECIDED TO TAKE IT IN TO THE DODGE DEALERS TO HAVE IT FIXED.  WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY THE CAR SUDDENLY STARTED TO MAKE A LOUD ROARING NOISE AND JERK.  I DROVE INTO AN EXIT IN ORDER TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY.  WHILE TRYING TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO ENTER THE YARD OF A STATION I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE.  THE CAR KEPT SLIDING TOWARDS THE CURB.  I HAD TO QUICKLY PULL UP THE HANDBRAKES TO STOP THE CAR FROM RUNNING INTO THE CURB AND BEYOND.  THEN IT STALLED BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE TO THE GAS STATION.  BEFORE TOTALLY STOPPING, ALL THE LIGHTS AND INDICATORS ON THE DASH BOARD WERE GOING ON AND OFF LIKE CRAZY THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT I HAVE HAD TO TOW THE CAR IN TO THE DODGE PEOPLE.  THE FIRST TIME, IN 2010, THE SHIFT STICK WOULD NOT BUDGE FROM PARK TO DRIVE AND THE CAR JUST WOULDN'T START.  WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DODGE DEALER IN BALTIMORE.  IN JANUARY OF 2011, WE HAD HAD TO TAKE THE CAR IN TO DODGE REPAIR SHOP FOR A PROBLEM FOR WHICH THEY HAD RECALLED THEIR VEHICLES, INCLUDING OURS.  WE MENTIONED TO THE MECHANICS AT THE DODGE REPAIR SHOP ABOUT A LOUD NOISE THAT WE WERE HEARING. THEY HAD SAID THAT THE LOUD NOISE WAS PROBABLY THE ALTERNATOR. WE BOUGHT THIS CAR IN MARCH 2009 AT A FORD DEALER IN BALTIMORE.  WE NOTICED VERY SOON AFTER, THAT THE CLOCK RACED AHEAD.  NEXT THE CONTROLS ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE STOPPED WORKING AND WOULD NOT LOCK NOR UNLOCK ANY OF THE DOORS.  ONLY THE CONTROLS ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WORKED.  THE COST TO FIX THE ALTERNATOR IS $650.  IT HAS COST US, NOT ONLY CAR RENTAL FEES TAXI FEES AND TOWING FEES, BUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF SAFETY ON THE ROAD.   THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR DEAL FOR ANY CONSUMER.

WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER GOT TO MY HOUSE HE INFORMED ME THAT I WAS THE 3RD DODGE AVENGER IN THE LAST WEEK THAT HE HAD TO TOW TO A GARAGE BECAUSE THE GEAR SHIFT WAS STUCK IN PARK. WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP MY CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP  I WAS TALKING TO THE MECHANIC AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD TWO OTHER DODGE CARS IN THE SHOP THAT HE WAS WORKING ON THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS MINE. ONE WAS A DODGE AVENGER AND THE OTHER WAS A DODGE MAGNUM. HE SAID THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HIS SHOP HAS BEEN REPAIRING MORE AND MORE DODGE VEHICLES WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, GEAR SHIFT STUCK IN PARK. HE STATED THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST 12 - 15 CARS IN THE LAST MONTH THAT THEY HAD TO FIX. I FEEL THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS OF WHY SO MANY DODGE CARS GEAR SHIFTS ARE GETTING STUCK IN PARK AND THAT DODGE NEEDS TO POSSIBLY DO A RECALL OF THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE ONLY HAD MY CAR 6 MONTHS AND I FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. *TR",

WE ARE DOCKED POINTS WHEN WE ARE LATE OR MISS WORK AND I AM NEVER LATE AND NEVER MISS WORK. YOU CAN BE TERMINATED WITH JUST 4 POINTS. I DID RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET ABOUT MY CAR, TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH IT AND FOUND OUT ALOT MORE PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS I HAVE. THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWHERE. LUCKILY IT HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY BUT I HAVE A SMALL CHILD THAT I'M OUT WITH ALOT BY MYSELF. I FEEL IT IS A SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S A PLASTIC PIECE THAT BREAKS OFF AND CAUSES THE SPRING THAT'S ATTACHED TO IT TO LET THE CAR OUT OF PARK FLY OFF AND THEN YOU ARE JUST STUCK. THERE IS NO WAY TO OVER RIDE IT UNLESS YOU TAKE THE ENTIRE CONSOLE OUT AND MANUALLY PULL THE PINK LEVER BACK. I'M NOT A HELPLESS FEMALE BUT I CAN'T TAKE A COMPLETE CONSOLE OUT BY MYSELF.

I HAVE NOT HAD IT REPAIRED AT THE MOMENT..I'M DRIVING WITH MY CONSOLE COMPLETELY OFF AND MANUALLY PULLING UP ON THE PINK LATCH AND PUTTING IT IN GEAR.

LITERALLY 30 SECONDS LATER, AND BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO REACT AT ALL, MY BRAKES STOPPED WORKING AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO STOP MY VEHICLE.  I HAD JUST ABOUT MADE IT TO THE EXIT RAMP WHEN I REALIZED BY LOOKING IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR THAT THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM MY CAR.  AS I HAD STEERED ONTO THE EXIT RAMP, I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW FLAMES SHOOTING FROM THE UNDERNEATH PART OF MY CAR.  WITHOUT THINKING TWICE I JUMPED FROM THE MOVING VEHICLE (WHICH AT THE TIME STILL WAS GOING AT ABOUT 20 MPH).  I WAS NOT HURT PHYSICALLY BUT WAS EXTREMELY SHAKEN UP.  ANOTHER TRAVELER WHO HAD PULLED UP ON THE SERVICE ROAD TO HELP ME, INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE FOR AT LEAST 1/4 OF A MILE ON THE HIGHWAY AND THAT HE HAD BEEN ATTEMPTING TO FLAG ME DOWN.  AFTER I HAD ESCAPED THE VEHICLE, THE CAR CONTINUED IN A DIAGONAL PATH TOWARD ONCOMING RUSH HOUR HIGHWAY TRAFFIC.  THE FIRE CONTINUE TO BURN AND HAD BECOME VERY BAD, TO THE POINT WHERE THE ENTIRE FRONT HALF OF THE CAR WAS ABLAZE.  THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED THE OUT OF CONTROL VEHICLE WAS A WIRE FENCE IN THE DIVIDER BETWEEN THE SERVICE ROAD AND MAIN HIGHWAY.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND MANUFACTURER ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK AT LEAST 15-20 MINS TO RESPOND WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO BECOME SEVERELY DAMAGED TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NOW EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN A CAUSE.  MY INSURANCE ONLY COVERED MY CAR LOAN AND NOW I AM OUT MONEY FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW VEHICLE.  THIS SITUATION IS VERY SERIOUS.  THERE COULD HAVE BEEN CHILDREN OR ELDERLY PERSONS IN THE VEHICLE WHO COULD HAVE DIED.  PLEASE HELP ME INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE.  I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY TO STILL HAVE MY LIFE AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION AS HAVING INITIATED A DUTY TO KEEP OTHERS SAFE FROM DANGERS OF THE SAME. *TR",
