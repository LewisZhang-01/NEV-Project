ONLINE RESEARCH INDICATED A BRACKET BROKE THAT HOLDS THE DRIVERS SEAT DOWN, AND THIS IS A WELL KNOWN ISSUE FOR THE HONDA PILOT. THEY SAID NO RECALL BECAUSE NOBODY HAD DIED?? THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. THE RE-UPHOLSTERER HAD THE BRACKET WELDED AS A SIDE-JOB WHEN HE DID HIS WORK. STILL, THIS ISN'T OK. IF THE SEAT HAD LET GO AND SLID FORWARD WHILE I WAS DRIVING, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I NEEDED TO REPORT THIS.",

I RELATED THE ABOVE TO HER. I TOLD HER THAT IN THE WINTER 2006-207 I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM AMERICAN HONDA INDICTING THAT THE OPDS CONTROL UNIT AND SENSOR HAD THE WARRANTY EXTENDED TO 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES. I ASKED IF THIS WARRANTY HAD BEEN FURTHER EXTENDED AND SHE INDICATED IT HAD NOT BEEN. SHE DID SOME RESEARCH ON MY VEHICLE AND TOLD ME THESE COMPONENTS HAD BEEN REPLACED IN AUGUST OF 2011. I ASKED IF THEY COULD BE REPLACED AGAIN FOR NO CHARGE AND SHE SAID NO. SHE SAID TO CHECK WITH A HONDA DEALER AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HELP. I INDICATED THAT THE $1,550.00 QUOTE FROM THE SHOP THAT DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM WAS 35-40% OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE VEHICLE AND TO SPEND THIS AMOUNT ON THE REPAIR NOW WOULD NOT BE A WISE DECISION ON MY PART. I RETURNED TO MY RECORDS FOR THE VEHICLE AND I FOUND A RECEIPT FROM DELRAY HONDA LOCATED AT 3000 S. FEDERAL HIGHWAY, DELRAY BEACH FL. DATED AUGUST 20, 2011 FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE OPDS SENSOR UNIT AND POSITION DETECTOR SYSTEM DETECTOR UNIT. THIS REPAIR WAS DONE AT NO CHARGE TO ME. THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE AT THAT TIME WAS 147,892. I CALLED DELRAY HONDA AND WAS TOLD THAT I HAD TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC CHARGE OF ABOUT $150.00 TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BEFORE THEY COUL GIVE AN ESTIMATE. I SAID I ALREADY HAD DONE THAT AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT HELP UNLESS I PAID TO HAVE THE PROBLEM INVESTIGATED.",

AT WHICH POINT THE CAR BEGAN A RIGOROUS SLIDE, BLACK SMOKE BILLOWED AS THE TREAD OF MY TIRES PEELED OFF. THE FORCE OF THE SLIDE EVENTUALLY JAMMED THE TIRES SIDEWAYS CAUSING THE CAR TO HOP AS IT PROPELLED FORWARD, FINALLY COMING TO A STOP ABOUT A MILE FROM THE STARTING POINT. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS A HORRIFIC RIDE, WHICH STILL CAUSES ME SOME STRESS. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO BILL'S TECH TRANS WHERE THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS FAULTY. BILL'S SENT THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION TO THE MAKER. AT THAT TIME I WAS UNAWARE OF THE RECALL ON HONDA PILOT 2003 TRANSMISSIONS. AFTER HEARING OF THE RECALL A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, I INFORMED AMERICAN HONDA OF MY INCIDENT. THEY REQUESTED RECEIPTS PERTAINING TO THE INCIDENT WHICH I PROVIDED IN FULL 3 TIMES. ONE OF THE FOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES HAD LOST SOME OR ALL OF THE PAPERWORK THAT I HAD SENT. IT HAS BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF OF DEALING WITH AMERICAN HONDA AND THEY CONTINUE TO PUT ME OFF, EVEN CLOSING THE CLAIM AT ONE POINT; THEY SENT A LETTER WHICH STATED, \"WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT YOU IN REGARDS TO YOUR REQUEST, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING YOU.\" I CALLED IMMEDIATELY AND THEY INFORMED ME THEY HAD CLOSED THE CLAIM DUE TO MY LACK OF RESPONDING TO THEIR PHONE CALLS. I TOLD THEM THAT BOTH MY HOME PHONE AND CELL PHONE KEEP LOGS OF WHO CALLS AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ON EITHER ONE. AMERICAN HONDA REOPENED THE CASE. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN REBUFFED REPEATEDLY. ABOUT A MONTH AGO I WAS TOLD SOMEONE WAS REVIEWING THE CASE FOR POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT AND HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE. IT SEEMS AS IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO HONOR THE RECALL ON THE 2003 HONDA PILOT TRANSMISSION. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP? AMERICAN HONDA RECALL CASE NO. 04263486",

THEY REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT MY WIFE'S SAFETY. HONDA BELIEVES IT IS A PART THAT JUST \"WEARS OUT\". IF IGNITION CYLINDERS WORE OUT WE WOULDN'T BE DRIVING CARS OVER TEN YEARS OLD. WE FIND HONDA'S ANSWER UNACCEPTABLE. ACTUALLY HONDA CORP SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE WAY THEY EVEN HANDLED THE SITUATION ON THE PHONE.

IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP WITH ONLY ONE \"RACING\" ENGINE NOISE AT 35MPH.   DIAGNOSED WITH CODE #P0740 (TORQUE CONVERTER) REQUIRING COMPLETE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT.

ONLY MAJOR REPAIR:  $1100 REPAIR DONE 82,400 - LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID (REPLACED FRONT PUMP SEAL, O-RING ON CONVERTER AND REAR MAIN) NOW, 2200 MILES LATER, TRANSMISSION IS OUT AND MUST BE REPLACED. DEALERSHIP QUOTING $5200 (NOT INCLUDING LABOR), AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH HONDA THEY HAVE OFFERED TO COVER 40% OF REPAIR PRICE (NOT INCLUDING LABOR).  I HAD A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD LAST LONGER THAN 87,000 MILES, CONSIDERING THE REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND SAFE DRIVING RECORD.  THANKFULLY, I HAVE ALL REPAIR/SERVICE PAPERWORK AND WILL BE GOING TO BBB ARBITRATION, AS SUGGESTED IN THE HONDA WARRANTY HANDBOOK.  ALSO, EXTREMELY THANKFUL THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT/INJURY/DEATH RELATED TO THIS SEVERE TRANSMISSION ISSUE (HAD I BEEN AT FULL HIGHWAY SPEED, 65MPH, THE OUTCOME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SO POSITIVE WHEN THE VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION HESITATED AND THEN SURGED.)  *TR",

THEY ASKED ME WHAT I WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.I TOLD THE MAN, IF THEY ARE NEGOTIATING A PRICE ON A NEW TRANNY, THEN HONDA KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS IN THESE CARS.I EXPLAINED TO HIM I'VE ALREADY SPENT 700.00 ON SENSORS AT MY MECHANIC, AND ANOTHER 250.00 WITH HIS SERVICE STATION ON THIS TRANNY, AND WOULD NOT PAY ANY MORE THAN 500.00. NEXT DAY GOT CALL TELLING ME THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANYTHING TOWARD NEW TRANNY.VERY UNHAPPY HONDA NOT MAKING GOOD ON AN OBVIOUS DEFECT IN  THESE TRANNYS! NO MORE HONDAS FOR ME.*KB",

THE DEALER NEVER TOLD ME THAT THE 2003 PILOT HAD ANY TYPE OF TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  I KNOW AS A CONSUMER, I SHOULD HAVE DONE MY OWN RESEARCH, BUT I HAD ALWAYS HEARD EXCELLENT THINGS ABOUT HONDA.  MY TRANSMISSION CONTINUES TO SLIP, AFTER REVVING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND EVEN THEN THEY NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT PROBLEMS.  I HAD MY REPAIRMAN LOOK AT IT BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED.  HE IS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THIS VEHICLE HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS & ALL DEALERS WERE AWARE OF IT.  I BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR - BUT OF COURSE, IT IS NO LONGER VALID.    I AM REALLY UPSET BECAUSE I DRIVE MY 2 CHILDREN AND THE TRANSMISSION WILL JUST STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC - WON'T LEAVE 2ND-3RD GEAR.  IT JUST REVS AT ABOUT 20-30 MILES.  IT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN AND NOW THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS COMING ON.  THE MESSAGE BOARDS SAY THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE. I WILL ATTEMPT TO SPEAK WITH MY LOCAL DEALER. I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA WHO BASICALLY OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE.  NOW, I AM LEARNING ABOUT THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE HONDA 2003 PILOT TRANSMISSIONS AND AM JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT IN THE EFFORT TO MAKE MONEY, NO ONE THOUGHT OF CONSUMER SAFETY.  OBVIOUSLY, HONDA RECOGNIZES THAT THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND STILL THEY ARE NOT OFFERING ANY HELP TO CONSUMERS.  IT IS APPALLING.    MY CAR DID HAVE THE HONDA REPAIR PATCH FOR THE TRANSMISSION IN 2004 ACCORDING TO AMERICAN HONDA RECORDS, AS THE TRANSMISSION HAD A PROBLEM EVEN THEN.

I ATTEMPTED TO FOLD THE SEAT DOWN VIA THE TOP LEVER AND WAS NOT ABLE TO. THE RESULT WAS THE TOP LEVER PLASTIC HANDLE BROKE OFF THE CABLE ACTUATOR. I PAID OVER $200 AT THE DEALER (PRIORITY HONDA IN HUNTERSVILLE NC, 28078 - 704.875.3100) TO HAVE IT FIXED EVEN THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE JAMMED CAUSING THE TOP LEVER TO BREAK OFF. AT REPAIR, NOTHING WAS FOUND THAT WOULD CAUSE THE JAM SUCH AS A FOREIGN OBJECT OR ANY DAMAGE. RECENTLY I TRIED TO MOVE THE SEAT FORWARD (SIDE LEVER ENGAGES BOTH BACK FOLD DOWN AND BASE RELEASE) TO ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO EXIT FROM THE THIRD ROW SEAT AND FOUND THAT THIS LEVER WAS NOT WORKING AS WELL. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DEALER THE EVENING OF 8/24/09 AND LEFT IT WITH THEM UNTIL THE EVENING OF 8/24. ED JENKINS THE SERVICE MANAGER ADVISED ME THAT HE PERSONALLY WORKED WITH THE MECHANIC TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE SPENDING THREE HOURS WORKING ON IT AND COULD NOT REPAIR IT. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT A NEW SEAT FRAME WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE SEAT OPERATIONAL. A SEAT SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER 6 YEARS WITH LIGHT USE AND IN MY OPINION SHOULD LAST AS LONG AS OR EXCEED THE LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE, WHICH IN THE US IS ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS I CONSIDER THIS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND AN IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE AS PASSENGERS MAY BECOME ENTRAPPED IN THE THIRD ROW SEAT.

EACH TIME THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN HAS HOOKED OUR VEHICLE UP TO A COMPUTER TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BUT EACH TIME HAS FAILED TO GET A CODE.  THE FIRST TIME THEY HOOKED IT UP THEY DID NOT GET A CODE AND WHEN WE GOT THE CAR BACK THE SRS LIGHT WAS ON.  WE THEN HAD TO GET THAT REPAIRED.  THE PROBLEM IS NOW A WEEKLY OCCURRENCE AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING THE DEALERSHIP CAN DO UNTIL THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THEY CAN RETRIEVE A CODE.  THE JERKING AND SURGING IS BECOMING MORE FREQUENT AND WE FEEL IT HAS BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE.

THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE PGK VALVE AND ASSURED ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE TRANSMISSION.  I CALLED  RENSSELAER HONDA TO SEE IF THEY COULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN ASKED THAT THEY CHECK THE TRANSMISSION.  THEY VERIFIED MY CONCERN AND NOTIFIED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THERE WAS  NOISE IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN LOCK UP AND THE LOCK- UP CONTROL SOLENOID VALVE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE SERVICE DIRECTOR OFFERED TO PAY FOR THE COST OF PARTS, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $1046.47 IN LABOR COSTS.

SUBSEQUENTLY, ON MONDAY (6/21/04) WE WERE INFORMED BY AMERICAN HONDA MOTORS THAT THE AFTERMARKET LEATHER UPGRADE WAS BOTH POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AND WOULD VOID OUR MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY. CONSEQUENTLY, ON TUESDAY, 6/22/04, WE RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND ADVISED THEM OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH THE INTENTION OF A REFUND OF OUR $5000 DEPOSIT AND CANCELLATION OF THE SALE. HOWEVER, HANLEES WAS NON COOPERATIVE IN THIS REQUEST.  REACHING AN IMPASSE, WE LEFT WITH THE CAR AND ARE NOW SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE.  HERE IS THE INFORMATION FROM HONDA REGARDING THE SAFETY CONCERNS OF THE AFTERMARKET LEATHER UPGRADE:  HONDA SERVICE NEWS, NO AFTERMARKET LEATHER SEAT COVERS WITH SIDE AIRBAGS, NEVER INSTALL AFTERMARKET LEATHER SEAT COVERS ON HONDA VEHICLES WITH SIDE AIRBAGS. HERE'S WHY:  THE OCCUPANT POSITION DETECTION SYSTEM (OPDS) SENSORS ATTACHED TO THE SEAT-BACK FOAM ARE CALIBRATED TO SENSE THROUGH THE SEAT COVER. IF THE COVER MATERIAL CHANGES, THE ODPS COULD MALFUNCTION OR TURN ON THE SRS INDICATOR.  SIDE AIRBAGS THAT DEPLOY THROUGH THE SEAT BOLSTER SEAM ARE SEWN WITH A SPECIAL THREAD THAT BURSTS AND POSITIONS THE SIDE AIRBAG TO PROTECT THE OCCUPANT. THIS THREAD ISN\"T AVAILABLE TO THE AFTERMARKET, WHICH MEANS YOU MUST REPLACE THE SEAT COVER WHENEVER A SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYS OR A SEAT COVER IS DAMAGED.  ALSO, WHEN I POINTED OUT THE SAFETY ISSUE OF THE AFTERMARKET LEATHER UPGRADE I WAS SOLD, THE RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER AT THE DEALER WAS \u001cWELL SIDE AIRBAGS AREN\u0019T EVEN MANDATORY, ANYWAY BOTTOM-LINE, I THINK IT IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THIS DEALER TO OFFER POSSIBLY HAZARDOUS AFTERMARKET UPGRADES TO IT\u0019S CUSTOMERS WITHOUT WARNING THEM OF THEIR UNSAFE NATURE.  *AK  THE ONSUMER WAS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE SAFETY ISSUE AND AS PART OF THE RESOLUTION HE WOULD LIKE TO WITHDRAW HIS COMPLAINT.  *NM",

I HAVE A POTENTIAL THEORY TO BOUNCE OFF YOU GOOD FOLKS...  BEING AN ENGINEER, I WAS A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE POWER STEERING PUMP NOT BEING FLOODED BY THE FLUID RESERVOIR. I WAS EVEN MORE CONCERNED THAT THE RESERVOIR WAS BELOW THE PUMP. I WAS ASSURED BY THE SALESMAN THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH THE ARRANGEMENT.  I LATER LEARNED ABOUT THE REPORTED PULLEY FAILURES. AGAIN I WAS ASSURED THAT WAS FIXED BY A NEW DESIGN. WELL, NOW WE HAVE TWO PUMP FAILURES WITH ONLY 5000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. BY FAILURE I MEAN THAT THE PUMP STARTED MAKING EXCESSIVELY LOUD WHINING NOISES CONSISTENT WITH DRY GEAR MESH NOISE.  WE BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALER PRIOR TO DRIVING TO THE POINT OF ACTUAL FAILURE.    HERE IS THE THEORY...  I SUSPECT THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP CANNOT HOLD ENOUGH VACUUM IN THE FLUID SUPPLY LINE TO MAINTAIN LUBRICATION OF THE PUMP. ONCE THE ENGINE HAS SET FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, THE PUMP COULD LOSE IT'S PRIME AND BEGIN TO RUN DRY ON THE NEXT USAGE OF THE VEHICLE. IF NOT RUNNING COMPLETELY DRY, MAYBE THERE IS ENOUGH LOSS OF PRIME TO CAUSE CAVITATION IN THE PUMP.  COULD IT BE THAT IF THIS IS NOT CAUGHT SOON ENOUGH THAT THE HEAT GENERATED CAUSES THERMAL EXPANSION OF THE GEAR SETS RESULTING IN THE PUMP SEIZING UP? IF THE PUMP SEIZES UP, WOULD IT THEN BE POSSIBLE TO PRESENT ENOUGH FORCE BY THE SERPENTINE BELT TO CREATE ENOUGH TORQUE TO SHEER OFF THE PULLEY?  LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK. I AM CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH MY DEALERSHIP ON THIS (AGAIN).   *LA",

THE HONDA MECHANIC EXPERIENCED   STRONG DISCOMFORT AT THIS SPEED.  IF YOU GO TO THE LEGAL  RURAL SPEED LIMIT 65 MPH, THE PAIN BECOMES IN MY CASE SEVER . IF  SOME OPENS THE REAR WINDOW AT THAT SPEED IN MY CASE IT WILL CAUSE ME MAJOR PROBLEMS.  FIRST I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO HEAR AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE TO YIELD.  I WOULD BE BUSY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE PAIN AND MAY LOSE CONTROL OF MY CAR.  PEOPLE HAVING DOGS IN THEIR VEHICLE AND LEAVING THE BACK WINDOW OPEN WILL EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM.  I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE BUYING THE VEHICLE AND THIS IS MY FIRST SUV OR ANYTHING LARGER THAN A 2DR COUPE  PASSENGER VEHICLE.  I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IF  I  KNEW THIS FIRST.  ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU.  *AK",
