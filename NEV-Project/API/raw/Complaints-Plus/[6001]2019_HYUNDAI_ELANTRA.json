The oil drum had other things leaked into it like antifreeze. i called hyundai, because it is under warranty. (only 34,000 miles on it). AT that time they informed me of the RECALL. it is an engine recall where the EXACT thing happens. It sat at the dealership for a week and a half before they even would look at it. THEN they refuse to fix the recall. they submitted a \"prior auth\" for warranty repair. We had to submit oil change info (which we did). AFTER 5 WEEKS they told us VIA TEXT MESSAGE that hyundai denied to cover warranty due to neglect. THEY ARE BLAMING US WHEN THERE IS AN ENGINE RECALL ON THIS CAR!?!?! They won't even SPEAK about the recall, they are rude and told us to go to the BBB and get an attorney. I have attached our oil change receipts that we sent them.PLEASE HELP!",

I have had this problem many times and Hyundi replaced both headlights, but now they say they won't fix them because of the miles. This headlight design was new for the 2019 model year, I had a 2018, and a 2017 and had no problems with them. The 2019 has a projection type bulb, and uses a mechanical flap to change from high to low beam. This flap sticks, or fails to operate resulting in very intermittent operation. This is a very poor design and many times oncoming cars get blinded by one of the high beams that doesn't return to low beam. The problem is very intermittent so it doesn't always happen when your in the shop. I have talked to other Hyundi owners having the same problem, and I think this is a safety problem that needs a recall. Replacing these lights will cost about $1,000 and many people out of warranty will not replace them.",
