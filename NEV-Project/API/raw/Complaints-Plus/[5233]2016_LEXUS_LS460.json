        "summary": "I PURCHASED LEXUS LS460 AWD 2016 IN 01/2017.  FEW MONTHS AGO THE NOISE LEVEL IN THE CABIN BECAME TOO LOUD EVEN TO HEAR THE RADIO.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE LEXUS DEALER WHO SOLD THE CAR TO ME FOR CHECK UP. I ASKED THEM TO USE A DECBEL METER TO READ THE NOISE LEVEL. INSTEAD THEY SENT A TECHNICIAN TO DRIVE THE CAR AND HE SAID THAT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM TIRES. IF THAT WAS THE CASE I ASKED THEM TO CHANGE ALL THE TIRES (I AGREED TO PAY). BUT THEY REFUSED TO CHANGE FOR SOME FLIMSY REASON TO HELP ME TO SAVE MONEY. I FIGURED OUT THAT TIRES WERE NOT THE CAUSE AND SOMETHING ELSE COULD BE THE REA SON THEY DID NOT WANT TO DISCLOSE OR EXPOSE.  IN THE MEANTIME THE CAR STARTED STALLING WHILE DRIVING 2 MONTHS AGO AND I IGNORED IT THINGKING MY NEW SHOES WERE CAUSING IT.  THEN DAY BEOFE YESTERDAY WHILE I WAS CLIMBING A STEEP SLOPE IN CAPITOL HEIGHTS THE CAR STALLED AND I WAS TO FORCED TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR WITH ALL MY STRENGTH TO PUSH IT FORWARD AND IT SLOWLY CLIMBED THE SLOPE. I WAS CONCERNED TO THE EXTENT I FEARED THAT IT COULD SLIDE BACKWARDS CAUSING MAJOR ACCIDENT.  I COMPLAINRD TO LEXUS AND THEY SENT ME TO ANOTHER DEALER. AGAIN NO DECIBEL METER WAS USED ANDTHE MECHANIC SAW EVERYTHING NORMAL AND THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS REVEALED NOTHING.  NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ENGINE IN LS460 HAS STALLING PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY UNDER RECALL FOR FIXING THE VALVE IN THE ENGINE. THE CAR HAS ONLY 43K MILES AND ASKED LEXUS TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE. BUT LEXUS REFUSED WITHOUT ANY REASONABLE EXPLANATION. THE VEFICLE WAS ON A CITY STREET IN CAPITOL HEIGHTS WHILW TAKING A RIGHT TURN TO A STEEP SLOPE STREET.WHEN IT STALLED.",
