AS I APPROACHED A HILL, THE PATHFINDER SUDDENLY SMELLED LIKED SOMETHING WAS ON FIRE AND THE ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING.  I MANAGED TO PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY AND COAST TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER.  THE BURNING SMELL LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES, BUT I COULD NOT TELL WHERE THE SOURCE WAS AT THE TIME.  I RAN SEVERAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING ECU CODES, BUT DID NOT FIND ANYTHING INDICATIVE OF A PROBLEM OF THIS NATURE. IN JANUARY 2020, I ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE AFTER REPLACING SEVERAL WORN OUT DRIVETRAIN COMPONENTS (CLUTCH, ENGINE, RADIATOR, ENGINE GASKETS) AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD NOT START. I FOUND A BURNED OUT FUSE TO THE ECCS2, 10 AMP CIRCUIT.  I REPLACED THE FUSE AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE DASHBOARD EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS NOT ON OR RUNNING AT THE TIME. AGAIN THE SMOKE LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES.  THIS TIME I WAS ABLE TO SEE SMOKE COMING FROM THE COMPUTER CASING OF THE VEHICLE'S ECU.  I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY AND REMOVED THE ECU FROM THE VEHICLE.  I DISCOVERED A BURNED CHIP INSIDE.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF RESEARCH, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE AND LEARN THAT THIS HAPPENS TO MANY OTHER MODELS OF NISSAN VEHICLES OF SIMILAR YEAR MODEL.  THE CAUSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME - THE IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE SEALS FAIL, THEN WATER GETS INSIDE THE ELECTRIC IACV MOTOR AND WHEN THE ECU TRIES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE IACV FAILURE, IT OVERLOADS THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT AND SHORTS OUT THIS PARTICULAR CHIP.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED SPENDING SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HAVE NISSAN REPLACE PARTS AND REPAIR THEIR ECU AS THESE VEHICLES ARE NOW OUT OF WARRANTY.",

THE PROBLEM WAS NOT ONLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE DRIVER SIDE UNDER CARRIAGE OF THE VEHICLE AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE FRAME BODY STRUCTURE. IT CAUSED ALSO DAMAGE TO THE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS.  BEFORE MY CAR GOT BROKEN, I HEARD A NOISE FROM ITS RIGHT SIDE AND I WAS DRIVING IT ON THE HIGHWAY, FOR A SECOND I LOST THE ABILITY TO STEEL MY CAR, BUT I KEPT IT STEADY UNTIL I COULD GET THE NEXT EXIT. I COULD HAVE SUFFERED A FATAL ACCIDENT THAT DAY. THERE IS A RECALL FOR FRAME/BODY STRUCTURE CORROSION FOR THIS MODEL 2001 PATHFINDER REGISTERED IN NEW JERSEY. AS SOON I WAS AWARE ABOUT IT,  I CALLED TO NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO EXPLAIN MY SITUATION. ONE OF THE NISSAN REPRESS. ADVISED ME TO TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP IN AVENEL NJ. MY CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE, SO I CALLED TO THE TOWING TRUCK TO PICK AND DROP IT OFF TO THE DEALERSHIP ON DEC 26, 2013. SINCE THEN, I HAVE NOT HAD A RESPONSE FROM NISSAN TO HELP ME WITH MY SITUATION. EACH TIME I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE, THEY SAID THAT MY CASE IS STILL IN PROCESS, AND I NEED TO WAIT FOR A DECISION.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT, I HAVE BEEN IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION DRIVEN MY CAR IN THAT  MATTER. I NEED A CAR TO GO TO WORK FOR MY LIVELIHOOD AND ALSO TO TAKE MY CHILDREN TO THEIR SCHOOL. I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR A CAR RENTAL. AND AFTER ALL OF THESE, NISSAN DOES NOT HAVE ANY SENSE OF COOPERATION. I REQUESTED THEM TO HELP ME WITH A PROVISIONAL CAR TO KEEP MY LIFE STYLE ON, BUT THEY DENIED IT. I NEED HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT  NHTSA TO MAKE NISSAN TAKE CARE ABOUT THIS RECALL.   *TR",

IT WORKED FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT AND THEN I GOT AN ERROR MESSAGE ONE DAY WHEN I TRIED TO LOAD A CD AND IT HASN'T WORKED SINCE. LAST SPRING, I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A TIRE ROTATION AND BALANCE AND MY MECHANIC NOTED THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT FISH-TAILING IN THE BACK WHICH WAS CAUSED BY DETERIORATION OF THE REAR BUSHINGS, AND OVER TIME, THE FISH-TAILING WOULD GET SO BAD, IT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHEN BRAKING. APPARENTLY THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN CERTAIN PATHFINDER MODELS, AND NISSAN EVEN CORRECTED THE PROBLEM IN FUTURE MODELS OF THE PATHFINDER ONCE THE PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED. I HAVE READ MULTIPLE POSTS TO THIS WEBSITE AS WELL AS OTHERS REGARDING BOTH OF THESE ISSUES IN THE 2001 NISSAN PATHFINDER. HOW CAN NISSAN NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT OF THIS FAULTY EQUIPMENT? THE REAR BUSHING PROBLEM IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD, AND I PRAY FOR NISSAN'S SAKE NO ONE IS EVER KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE A GOOD ATTORNEY WILL HAVE A FIELD DAY IN COURT WITH THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. IS NHTSA EVER GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? BASED ON AN ARTICLE I READ LOCATED AT THIS WEBSITE: HTTP://WWW.WALLPAPERAMA.COM/FORUMS/NISSAN-PATHFINDER-WOBBLES-PROBLEM-ROCKS-SIDE-TO-SIDE-T6838.HTML, NISSAN HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM SINCE AT LEAST 1998 AND HAS EVEN ISSUED A SERVICE REPAIR DESCRIPTION FOR NISSAN DEALERSHIPS. THIS IS A MAJOR EXPENSIVE REPAIR. SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS TO HELP CONSUMERS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  *TT..UPDATED  12/02/14 *BF",

THE 2001 PATHFINDER LE 4X4, DIDN'T FLIP OVER.  I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND PULLOVER ON THE SIDE.  THE ENTIRE TIRE TREAD SEPARATED INTACT, AROUND THE TAILPIPE BRACKETS AND REAR MUDFLAP.  THE TREAD IS UNDAMAGED: NO NAIL OR SCREWS OR ANY OTHER ROAD HAZARD OR DAMAGES.  THE AAA SENT A TRUCK WHO CHANGED THE TIRE.  HIS COMMENT WAS:  \"IN OVER 22 YEARS OF DOING TIRE AND MECHANICAL WORK, HE NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS\". I RETURNED THE TIRE TO COSTCO.  THE TIRE CENTER MANAGER WAS VERY COOPERATIVE,WHERE THEY ORDERED A NEW TIRE WITHOUT QUESTION.DAMAGES TO THE PATHFINDER WERE ESTIMATED AT $900 DUE TO THE NEED TO REPLACE THE TAILPIPE/MUFFLER ASSEMBLY AND THE MUDFLAP WAS DESTROYED.   COSTCO MANAGER SAID THAT THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES WOULD NEED TO BE MADE DIRECTLY TO MICHELIN.  I DID THAT. IT IS A MIRACLE THAT THE VEHICLE DIDN'T FLIP OVER !!!.  MICHELIN REQUIRED THAT THE TIRE BE RETURNED TO COSTCO, HAVE THEM CALL MICHELIN TO GIVE A REPORT OF THE SITUATION. MICHELIN REP SAID THAT THEY WOULD OFFER PERHAPS A 50% DISCOUNT ON THE PURCHASE OF NEW REPLACEMENT TIRE BUT NOTHING ELSE.  I WANT MICHELIN TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES SUSTAINED !!.  I WAS REQUIRED TO SEND THE TIRE TO MICHELIN (THEY EVENTUALLY PAID FOR THE SHIPPING) TO BE EXAMINED.  THE RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WAS A LETTER RESPONSE THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY \"DRIVER ERROR\" - BY RUNNING THE TIRE IN A RUN-FLAT CONDITION.  A RUN -FLAT CONDITION ????  THEY SENT A BROCHURE PRINTOUT EXPLAINING HOW THAT OCCURS.  AIR ESCAPES , RUNS LOW AND THE TIRE EVENTUALLY BLOWS OUT.  THERE WAS NO AIR ESCAPE NOR IS THERE ANY ROAD HAZARD DAMAGE TO THE TREAD.

THE ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED WAS THE DRIVER'S FIRST \"AT FAULT\" ACCIDENT IN 25 YEARS OF DRIVING.  THE CLEAR DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BRAKE AND GAS PEDAL ON THE PATHFINDER IS 2 3/8\". ON OTHER CARS, I MEASURED THE CLEAR DISTANCE AS 3\". THIS EXTRA DISTANCE MAKES A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DISTINGUISHING THE BRAKE AND GAS PEDALS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS SPACING IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE PATHFINDER AND CREATES AN UNSAFE CONDITION.  I RECOMMEND THAT NISSAN RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND REPLACE THE EXISTING BRAKE PEDAL AND LEVER ARM WITH A LEVER WHICH IS OFFSET TO INCREASE THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BRAKE AND GAS PEDALS. AT THIS TIME, I WILL DRIVE THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT SHOES OR WEAR A SOFT SOLE SHOE SO THAT I CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND GAS PEDAL. A HARD SOLE SHOE CAUSES BOTH PEDALS TO FEEL THE SAME, AND BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE PEDALS, IS THE SOURCE OF CONFUSION AND SAFETY CONCERN.*AK",

DEALER INSPECTED THE CAR AND MUITL TIMES BALANCE THE WHEEL/TIRE USING RADIAL FORCE BALANCING BUT UNABLE TO GET RID OF EXCESSIVE VIBRATION. DEALER GAVE ME BACK SUV AS IS (KNOWING IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE) AND ORDERED 4 NEW TIRES OF THE SAME BRAND WHICH TOOK A WEEK TO RECIEVE. I REQUESTED TO REPLACE TIRE WITH MICHILINE LTX BUT DEALER AND NISSAN REFUSED TO DO SO. I REQUESTED A SAFETY AND RESPONSIBILTY LETTER SINCE THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME A CHOOSE OF WHAT BRAND TO CHOOSE BUT THEY WOULD NOT DO SO.  DEALER FINALLY REPLACED TIRES AND VIBRATION IS 90 %IMPROVED BUT STILL EXISTS.   ALSO I HAVE TAKEN MY SUV FOR A RATTLE IN STEERING AND THE DEALER FOUND THAT THE DRIVER AIRBAG WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY FROM FACTORY. DEALER FIXED THE PROBLEM AND THEN THREE WEEKS LATER THE SAME PROBLEM RETURNED. TOOK SUV TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND THEY PUT \"TUBES IN THE SPRING BEHIND THE AIRBAG\" THIS IS TO REDUCE RATTLE/VIBRATION. NOW THE HORN IS UNOPERATIONAL DUE TO THIS. YOU MUST PUT BOTH HANDS ON THE HORN/AIRBAG AND PUSH VERY HARD EST 40IBS OF FORCE TO ENGAGE THE HORN.  THIS IS UNACCPTIBLE AND UNSAFE TO OPERATE THE VECHICAL WITH OUT A HORN.  I DO HAVE A SAFETY CONVERN TO OTHER OWNER OF THIS SUV DUE TO DEFECTIVE TIRES THAT CAN BLOW AND CASUE A SEROUS EXCEDENT. I DP HOPE THAT NHTSA TAKE ACTION. (DOT NUMBER: EN6D0800  TIRESIZE: 255/65R16)",
