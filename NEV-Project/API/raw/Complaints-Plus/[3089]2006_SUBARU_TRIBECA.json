UPON PICKING UP MY VEHICLE, I WAS HEADING HOME AND NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS VERY MUSHY AND MY FOOT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR WAS BARELY STOPPING.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE YET TO CONTACT ME REGARDING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

AROUND JULY OF 2010 MY WIFE AND I BOUGHT A SECOND HAND 2006 B9 TRIBECA FROM A DEALER IN PHOENIX, AZ.  WE ENJOYED THE VEHICLE SO MUCH, THAT WE DECIDED TO BRING IT WITH US ON OUR MOVE BACK TO PANAMA.  I GUESS THIS IS WHERE SUBARU'S COMMITMENT TO SAFETY DRAWS THE LINE.  EVERYONE I HAVE SO FAR SPOKEN TO HAS BASICALLY TOLD ME WELL SINCE YOU DIDN'T BUY THE CAR HERE WE CAN'T HELP YOU, OR, SINCE YOU ARE NO LONGER HERE, WE CAN'T PAY FOR IT.  I AM SITTING HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOUR DESIGN FLAWS, ARE MY FAULT JUST BECAUSE I MOVED THE CAR FROM ONE SUBARU MARKET, TO ANOTHER.  THE RECALLS IN QUESTION ARE: WQE41, WQY60, AND TKA16.  MY WIFE AND 2 CHILDREN WERE IN THE CAR ABOUT TO LEAVE MY RESIDENCE WHEN IT CAUGHT ON FIRE.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT AND REAR PUDDLE LIGHTS BOTH FAILED.  THE FRONT ONE WAS SMOKING HEAVILY AND THE REAR ONE WAS ON FIRE.  MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE HOSE AND STARTED SPRAYING THE REAR ONE WHILE I GRABBED A 10MM WRENCH AND DISCONNECTED THE LEAD TO THE CAR BATTERY.
