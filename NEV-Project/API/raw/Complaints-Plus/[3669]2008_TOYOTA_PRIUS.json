There was about 250 ft between the descent of the incline, and the red light at the bottom. As soon as I began my descent I lost all brake pressure. Fortunately there was an entrance to a parking lot to my right, just before the stop light. When friction had slowed my car down I was able to find a parking spot to pull over. Accompanied with my failing brakes were all of my brake associated lights on the dash, and the red triangle light. There was also a steady high pitch buzzing noise. Still, without brake pressure I get out to inspect the car. There were no signs of leaking brake fluid and the rotors and pads were in great condition. The drum brakes in the back were also in great working order. After finding nothing of suspicion, I turn the far off and back on. To my surprise all the warning lights were off, and my brakes were once again functioning properly. The only thing changed was a buzzing noise from the brake actuator as it built up pressure. It has now been over a month with no issues from the brakes expect for the lingering unusual noise from the actuator, which I suspect it to mean that the actuator is close to failing. I no longer feel safe driving this vehicle. I took the car to my nearest Toyota dealer the day after the incident. They were not able to read any codes because the codes did not store. They told me they would have to see the car with all the lights on for it to read. Basically meaning, \"we can't do anything about it until you're life is at great risk\". This problem should absolutely be recalled as I am not the only one to have this issue. Toyota says there top priority is consumer safety, yet they blatantly  disregard the issue, and instead do very little to resolve it.",

I encountered a braking problem one day after starting the car and backing up. The brakes felt spongy and car started to roll backwards with the brakes applied. Had to push harder for the car to stop. The VSC, ABS and brake lights were on, on the dash with a tone I could hear indicating something is wrong. I shut the car down and restarted and problem still existed. I called the dealer and did a little research online and found out the brake actuator had malfunctioned and will need to be replaced. Dealer said there was a program offering an extended warranty, but that has expired in 2018. I never received any letter from dealer or Toyota themselves indicating there was a problem. I called Toyota corporate office and they indicated a letter was sent out in 2016, but I never received any letter. The car now sits and I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s worth fixing. This car has meticulously been taken car of and ran great when I was driving it. I will try reaching out to Toyota again to see if there any exceptions to this case. Over 700,000 cars were affected by this problem and was wondering why a recalled was not issued.",

ALTHOUGH NEWER MODELS (2019) BOTH EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE AND HAVE ENJOYED A RECALL FOR THE PART (THE COMBINATION METER) TO BE FIXED, FOR OLDER PRIUSES SUCH AS MINE THE EQUIVALENT WORK IS LIMITED TO THOSE WHO PAID FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTEE RELATING TO THE KNOWN PROBLEMS OF THIS ONE SINGLE PART--A WARRANTEE THAT I WAS NEVER OFFERED WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR IN 2011, AND THAT ENDED IN 2015.    THE 2019 RECALL'S INFORMATION IS HERE:  HTTPS://PRESSROOM.TOYOTA.COM/?GENERATE_PDF=58021    EVEN IF I HAD PURCHASED THE PART'S EXTENDED WARRANTEE, WHETHER OR NOT I'D EVEN ABLE TO *USE* IT BY DEMONSTRATING TO THE TECHNICIAN THAT THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING IS QUESTIONABLE, NOT TO MENTION LITERALLY UP TO THE WEATHER. THE PROBLEM BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR TECHS TO DIAGNOSE SINCE THERE AREN'T MANY COLD AND RAINY DAYS TO SET IT OFF WHERE I LIVE, NOT TO MENTION IT WOULD OFTEN RESOLVE ITSELF BEFORE THE CAR CAN BE TAKEN INTO THE SHOP FOR DIAGNOSIS. IT WAS ONLY POSSIBLE THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS WORSE THAN IN THE PAST, SEVERE ENOUGH THAT I COULD NOT TURN OFF MY CAR.     THE FACT THAT TOYOTA WOULD HIDE REPAIRS FOR A MASSIVE SAFETY FLAW BEHIND A LIMITED-RUN WARRANTY, WHEN THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY BROADER AND AFFECTS CARS PRODUCED OVER 15 YEARS APART (2004 TO 2019) IS ONE THING.

ARE THEY WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BE INJURED DUE TO THIS PROBLEM?",

ALL BECAUSE TOYOTA EFFED UP AND USED A VERY POOR CHOICE IN MATERIALS FOR THEIR TRUNK LATCHES.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD CORRECT SO OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TRUNK ISSUES THAT END UP CAUSING PROBLEMS.

HOWEVER, EVEN THIS IS A KNOWN MANUFACTURING-DEFECT, TOYOTA IS REFUSING TO PAY FOR THIS SERVICE BECAUSE THEY REASONED THAT THIS HAS FALLEN OUT OF THEIR WARRANTY DATES, WHICH INCLUDED 2 TYPES OF COVERAGE: PRIMARY COVERAGE ENDED 12/31/2017 AND SECONDARY COVERAGE FOR CAR LESS THAN 10 YEARS OLD FROM THE FIRST USE OR 150,000 MILES, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.  ACCORDING TO TOYOTA, THE FIRST USE OF MY TOYOTA PRIUS IS 10/13/2007, AND 10 YEARS FROM THAT DATE IS 10/13/2017, WHICH CAME BEFORE EVEN THE DEADLINE FOR PRIMARY COVERAGE.  THIS \"WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM\" IS FOR 2004-2009 PRIUS.  YOU WOULD THINK IT WILL COVER AT LEAST UNTIL THE LAST MANUFACTURED CAR OF 2009, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  ALSO, THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER BOTH STATED THAT THEY CAN'T FIX IT UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABS LIGHT TURNED ON AND IT WARNS ABOUT THE ISSUE.  YOU WOULD THINK IF THAT LIGHT COMES ON, IT WILL BE VERY DANGEROUS IF YOU ARE DRIVING 60 MPH ON THE FREEWAY AND YOU CAN'T BRAKE!  TOYOTA DEFINITELY DID NOT THINK SO.      THE REPAIRS I WAS QUOTED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS $2800 + TAX, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT.  I FEEL RIDICULED BECAUSE THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING RELATED TO WEAR-AND-TEAR.  TOYOTA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND THE REASON THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR THIS SERVICE IS BECAUSE IT FELL OUTSIDE OF THE \"EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD\".  WE DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE THE NOTICE TO BEGIN WITH; I FOUND THIS OUT ON THE INTERNET AND APPARENTLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLES AND TOYOTA EITHER DRAGGED OUT THE TIMELINE OF REPAIR SO THAT IT WILL SURPASS THE DEADLINE STATED ON THE LETTER OF THE PROGRAM.",

I HAD TO REPLACE ANOTHER HEADLAMP AT ABOUT 80,000 MILES, AND THE OPPOSITE SIDE HEADLAMP AT ABOUT 90,000 MILES.

I HAVE REPLACED THE LAMP WITH ONE THAT I THOUGHT WAS BURNED OUT AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. I HAVE CHECKED ON LINE, AND HAVE READ HOW PEOPLE TAKING THEIR PRIUS TO THE DEALER ARE BEING CHARGED FROM $300.00 TO $4000.00 FOR CHANGING VARIOUS PARTS, AND STILL ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAVE BEE STOPPED BY THE POLICE TWICE FOR HAVING 1 HEADLIGHT OUT, AND I NEVER KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE OUT. I HAVE READ OF SOME PEOPLE HAVING THE PROBLEM WITH BOTH HEADLIGHTS, AND KNOW THAT IT IS AN ACCIDENT JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN.

FORTUNATELY, WE WERE APPROACHING AN EXIT OFF RAMP, AND WE WERE ABLE TO SAFELY GET OFF THE FREEWAY AND TO A GAS STATION USING THE LIGHT OF OUR HAZARD LIGHTS. AFTER GETTING TO THE GAS STATION, WE WERE ABLE TO GET BOTH HEADLIGHTS BACK O BY TOGGLING THE HEADLIGHT CONTROL ON AND OFF. WE DECIDED THE SAFE THING TO DOSAS TO GET A HOTEL AND RESUME OUR TRIP IN DAYLIGHT. THE HOTEL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE ROAD, ONE OF OUR HEADLIGHTS BEGAN FLICKERING AGAIN AND WENT OUT AGAIN IN THE SHORT TIME IT TOOK US TO GET THERE. TOGGLING THE CONTROL AGAIN GOT THE LAMP BACK ON, BUT NEED TO TAKE OUR CAR TO GET SERVICED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE DRIVING IT AT NIGHT AGAIN.     AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM, I FOUND SEVERAL ARTICLES ON LINE, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING:    HTTP://WWW.TOYOTAPROBLEMS.COM/TRENDS/PRIUS-HEADLIGHTS/    THIS SEEMS TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT IS NOT ISOLATED TO OUR CASE OR EVEN JUST A FEW CASSIE'S. I URGE THE NHTSA TO REOPEN THEIR INVESTIGATION, AS MANY DRIVERS' AND PASSENGERS' LIVES COULD BE IN DANGER BECAUSE OF THIS ENGINEERING DEFECT.",

SECONDLY, THEY ARE SO DIFFICULT TO REPLACE THAT MY TRUSTED, LONG-TIME AUTO SHOP HAD TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE FRONT BUMPER TO REPLACE THEM, COSTING ME $300 IN LABOR.

THE ONLY SUGGESTION TO FIX THIS IS FROM TOYOTA WHICH IS TO TAKE THE CAR TO A DEALER AND FOR $550 THEY TAKE OFF THE BUMPER (DO SOME TRICK), AND PUT IN NEW BULBS.   INSTEAD, I SPENT $180 FOR 2 NEW BULBS, AND REPLACED THEM MYSELF (WITHOUT TAKING OFF THE BUMPER AND DOING THE TRICK), AND IT WORKED FOR 2 WEEKS BEFORE 1 OR THE OTHER BULB INTERMITTENTLY GOES OFF. AT LEAST THEY ARE BRIGHTER NOW, THOUGH THIS IS 1) A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE LIGHTS ACT UNPREDICTABLY, AND 2) REPLACING HEADLIGHTS IS ON THE ORDER OF CHANGING A TIRE OR WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  IT'S LIKE CHANGING A LIGHT BULB, NO?!  THE REAL ISSUE IS THE BALLASTS WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT REGULATE THE LIGHTS.  THESE ARE NOT EASY (FOR ME) TO FIX.  THIS ONLY SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON SOME CARS, AND I THINK THAT TOYOTA SHOULD REPLACE THE BALLASTS WHEN THIS COMES UP.   ALL THE BACK AND FORTH HAS LEFT ME WITH NOT GREAT HEADLIGHTS (GOING OFF RANDOMLY) FOR 2 MONTHS NOW WHILE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.  I HARDLY SEE WHY I SHOULD PAY $550 AT A DEALER, WHEN I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT WILL FIX THE ISSUE.

IT WAS 4;00 PM AND THE ROAD WAS CROWDED. IF THE LEFT TIRE HAD BLOWN OUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ACCIDENT. I IMMEDIATELY REPLACED THE TIRE WITH ANOTHER BRAND. AND SINCE I HAVE NO STORAGE, THE TIRE DEALER DISPOSED OF THE TIRE.  ON AUGUST 20, I HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR PASSENGER TIRE BECAUSE I NOTICED A QUARTER SIZED BUBBLE ON THE SIDEWALL. I HAVE A PHOTO OF THAT BUBBLE AND COPIES OF THE REPLACEMENT TIRE BILLS.  ALL FOUR TIRES WERE INSTALLED 12/19/2013 AT THE AUTO DEALER. AT THAT TIME THE CAR HAD 32,228 MILES. WHEN THE FIRST TIRE BLEW THE SPEEDOMETER READ 38,992 MILES ( 6,644 MILES), THE SECOND TIRE WAS REPLACED AFTER BEING DRIVEN ANOTHER 50 MILES WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND AND ALSO DISPOSED OF. THE REMAINING YOKAHAMA TIRES WERE PLACED ON THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  I SPOKE WITH A YOKAHAMA REPRESENTATIVE WHO SAID I NEEDED THE TIRES TO PROCEED WITH AN INVESTIGATION. HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO..  SINCE THIS TIRE DEFECT COULD HAVE HAD DISASTEROUS CONSEQUENCES. I WOULD LIKE AN   INVESTIGATION AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE SAFETY OF YOKAHAMA TIRES. ANY ACTION YOU CAN TAKE ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND OTHER MOTORISTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.ANY FURTHER INFORMATION INCLUDING THE PHOTO AND RECEIPTS I WILL BE PLEASED TO SHARE WITH YOU AT YOUR REQUEST.

WE TOLD THE DEALER THE CAR STILL HAD ELECTRICAL POWER. THEY STILL REPLACED THE 12V BATTERY.

THE \"CIRCLE\" ENDED AT AN INTERSECTION WHERE I WAS TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN. I TURNED MY STEERING TO THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE TRAJECTORY, BUT MY FRONT WHEELS SEEMED TO BE \"LOCKED\" IN THE LEFT TURNING MOTION.  I SLAMMED THE BRAKES, BUT COULD NOT STOP THE CAR FROM CLIMBING THE CURB AND SIDESWIPING A TREE, CAUSING MY DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT WHEEL TO BE SHOVED BACKWARD TOWARDS THE DRIVER DOOR IN THE WHEEL FRAME.  MY CAR IS NOW AT A BODY SHOP WITH AN AGREED $5600.00 IN DAMAGE, MOSTLY TO THE STEERING ASSEMBLY, SUSPENSION, AND WHEEL/AXLE. THE WHEEL PANEL ABOVE THE WHEEL WILL BE REPLACED, AND SCRATCHES ON THE FRONT BUMPER AND DRIVER DOOR WILL BE REPAIRED.  WORK IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY JANUARY 5.      I BELIEVE THAT THE CONDITION WHICH CAUSED THE STEERING TO LOCK IN A LEFT-TURN CONDITION WITHOUT WARNING  ON A DRY ROAD IS A SERIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT FOR WHICH I SHOULD BE REIMBURSED .FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC AND NO INJURIES, AND EVEN THE TREE SEEMS UNSCATHED.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC ON AN INTERSTATE OR IN CONGESTED HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC.       I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH MY PRIUS' PERFORMANCE TO THIS POINT, BUT BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MATTER AS EVIDENCED BY STEERING RELATED RECALLS ON SIMILAR VINTAGE PRIUS MODELS.  I REQUEST FULL REIMBURSEMENT FOR MY REPAIR, MINDFUL THAT THESE EXPENSES COULD BE A LOT HIGHER HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  I HAD PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED THIS INFORMATION TO A TOYOTA INQUIRY WEBSITE AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OR RESPONSE FORM TOYOTA.  *TR",

AFTER ONLY ABOUT 4 YEARS USE, THE RUBBER COVER ON THE HATCH RELEASE HANDLE (THE EXTERIOR HANDLE OF THE REAR HATCH) OF MY 2008 TOYOTA PRIUS, MELTED INTO A STICKY TARRY BLACK RUBBERY GOOEY MESS. IT DRIPS DOWN ON THE REAR BUMPER.   I CAN BEST DESCRIBE IT AS BEING A VISCOUS BLACK GLOB LIKE ROOFING TAR. TO OPEN THE HATCH, YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THIS BLACK GOO EACH TIME, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE THE HATCH RELEASE. EVENTUALLY THIS WILL DISABLE THE LATCH FROM OPERATING.  I WENT TO TOYOTA DEALER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT BUT DID NOT GET ANY ANSWERS AND CHOOSE TO IGNORE IT. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR AGENCY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE INSTANCES AND ALSO TO ASK TOYOTA WHY THEY ARE NOT RECALLING THESE HANDLES. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.  *TR",

I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL I GOT HOME TO HAVE MY HUSBAND CHECK THE LIGHTS. SOMETIMES THEY WORKED PROPERLY SO IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT THAT WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER GAVE US THE RUN AROUND AND ACTED AS IS THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT A HEADLIGHT PROBLEM, TOLD US TO COME RIGHT IN AND THEY WOULD REPLACE THE HEADLIGHTS FOR EITHER $8.00 OR $12.00 EACH WITH NO LABOR COST; AND THEN CHANGED AND SAID THEY WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM FOR $526.00! I SAID, \"NO, THANKS!\" AND WENT TO SEE ANOTHER LOCAL SHOP WHICH SPECIALIZES IN TOYOTAS. THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE LOOK ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS RELATING TO THIS PROBLEM. WHILE NO RECALLS ARE LISTED YET, I FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS FROM TOYOTA PRIUS OWNERS STATING EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM WE ARE HAVING. PLEASE HELP ALL OF US! SUDDENLY HAVING NO HEADLIGHTS WHILE DRIVING IN A POORLY LIT AREA IS CAUSING ME GRAVE (PUN INTENDED!) CONCERNS! I TRY NOT TO DRIVE AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN, BUT I AM NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO AVOID DOING SO. I AM VERY FRIGHTENED AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY HEADLIGHTS FIXED, BUT NOT AT HIGHWAY ROBBERY PRICES!

I THEN GOT OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT, WENT AND OPENED THE BACK DOOR, TOOK OUT THE NECESSARY MEALS, CLOSED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT INTO THE HOUSE FOR THE DELIVERY.  IN THE MEANTIME, MY FRIEND SAT IN THE PARKED CAR AND AFTER A VERY FEW MINUTES GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO LOOK AT SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORING GARDEN. OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE SHE SAW THE CAR CREEPING FORWARD. SHE RUSHED TO THE CAR AND TRIED TO STOP IT BUT COULDN'T AND SO BEGAN TO SCREAM MY NAME?  JUST AT THAT TIME I FINISHED MY DELIVERY CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND NOTICED THE CAR WAS NOT PARKED WHERE I LEFT IT AND HEARD HER SCREAMS. I RAN TO THE DRIVEWAY AND SAW THE CAR MOVING FORWARD. I RAN AFTER IT, MANAGED TO OPEN THE DOOR AND PUSHED THE POWER BUTTON TO TURN OFF THE MOTOR. THIS STOPPED THE CAR JUST IN TIME BEFORE RUNNING EITHER INTO A TREE, INTO ANOTHER CAR OR OFF THE DRIVEWAY DOWN A CLIFF.  WE WERE, OBVIOUSLY VERY SHAKEN UP BY THE INCIDENT.  NO ONE KNOWS WHY OR HOW THE CAR WENT OUT OF PARK INTO DRIVE.  BOTH MY FRIEND AND I ARE SURE THE CAR WAS STATIONARY WHEN I LEFT IT AND WHEN SHE LEFT IT.   IT SEEMS TO HAVE SUDDENLY SHIFTED.    I HAVE GONE BACK TO THAT SITE TO CHECK IF THERE WAS IN INCLINE OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE CAR TO MOVE. THE GROUND WAS FLAT, DRY AND NOTHING WAS THERE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS INCIDENT.  I AM WRITING THIS TO SEE IF THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE PRIUS. IS IT SOMETHING I MUST BE AWARE OF?  IS THERE SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DONE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?

FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS DURING THE \"OFF\" PORTION OF THIS CYCLE THE BRAKES WERE EFFECTIVELY INOPERATIVE, WITH THE PARKING/EMERGENCY BRAKE THE ONLY SOURCE OF BRAKING.  THIS BEHAVIOR PERSISTED AFTER SHUTTING DOWN AND RESTARTING THE CAR.    THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT THREE ERRORS HAD BEEN LOGGED:     C1247 - STROKE SENSOR     C1300 - ABS ECU MALFUNCTION     C2318 - LOW VOLTAGE ERROR    RESETTING THE COMPUTERS CLEARED THE WARNING INDICATIONS AND RESTORED NORMAL BRAKE SYSTEM BEHAVIOR.    AT MY BEHEST, THE DEALER WORKED WITH TOYOTA ENGINEERING TO IDENTIFY WHY A LOW VOLTAGE WOULD CAUSE A COMPUTER FAILURE WHICH COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF BRAKING ABILITY. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 8 DAYS BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO COMPLETE ANY SORT OF ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE.    ON 17 DECEMBER 2012 AT 27,324 MILES THE BRAKES AGAIN FAILED WITH THE SAME SET OF WARNING LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. THIS TIME, ABS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ACTIVE AT ALL. FOR THE FIRST 2-5 CM OF BRAKE PEDAL TRAVEL, IN THE REGIME WHERE REGENERATIVE BRAKING WOULD BE ACTIVE, NO BRAKING IS EVIDENT. AS THE PEDAL IS FURTHER DEPRESSED, THE HYDRAULIC/FRICTION BRAKES ABRUPTLY ENGAGE. PRESSING HARDER DOES RESULT IN INCREASED BRAKING THOUGH BRAKING IS ROUGH. NO PULSATION AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM ABS WAS NOTICED. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO BRAKE HARD ENOUGH TO LOCK UP THE BRAKES.    THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER.  *TR",

I NEEDED TO GET TO THE ROAD SEPARATING THE 2 LOTS IN ORDER TO GO HOME.  I HAD JUST STARTED THE PRIUS AND PUT IT INTO DRIVE WHEN IT STARTED TO ROAR LOUDLY, JUMPED OUT FAST, AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY, EVEN THOUGH I BRAKE MULTIPLE TIMES.

THE NOISE WAS VERY LOUD, AND THE CAR WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  PUMPING THE BRAKES OR HOLDING THEM DOWN DID NOTHING TO SLOW THE CAR, AND THE NOISE WAS TERRIFYING.  THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK, AND THE PRIUS CONTINUED TO MAKE A VERY LOUD ROARING NOISE.  THE SPEED OF THE CAR MADE STEERING DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, AND THERE COULD HAVE BEEN INJURIES. THE PRIUS THEN LEFT THE GIANT PARKING LOT, WENT DOWN THE MULCHED SLOPE, CROSSED THE STREET, BUMPED OVER THE CURB, AND WENT UP THE WALMART SLOPE HITTING A SMALL TREE.

WE BELIEVE THIS MELTING PROCESS STARTED AT ABOUT THE 2 YR. MARK. I THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A SINGULAR ISSUE, BUT HAVE FOUND THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO SEVERAL CAR OWNERS, PARTICULARLY IN FLORIDA. WE LIVE IN LOUISIANA. TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS, AND IS SELLING THE ENTIRE WIRING HARNESS FOR $96 PLUS REPAIR COSTS, AND HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT RECALLING THIS. FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, THIS MEANS YOU CAN EXPERIENCE EXTREME DIFFICULTY OPENING THE REAR HATCH (A LIFE SAFETY ACCESS POINT), AND WILL GET STICKY BLACK TAR ON YOU FROM THE MELTED DOWN RUBBER COVER OF THE EXTERIOR HATCH RELEASE HANDLE. TO ME, THIS IS BOTH A SERIOUS LIFE SAFETY ISSUE AND A SERIOUS QUALITY DEFECT THAT TOYOTA IS OPTING TO IGNORE AND ONLY FIXING ON VEHICLES WITH EXTENDED WARRANTIES, SINCE THE FAILURE APPEARS TO OCCUR AT AROUND THE 2 YEAR MARK (IE AFTER 2 YEARS OF EXPOSURE TO THE BRIGHT SUN IN LOUISIANA FOR EXAMPLE).

THEY ALSO SAID THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE AND INSISTED THAT I MUST HAVE THE PROBLEM DUPLICATED AT THE DEALERSHIP. SO, I RETURNED TO MY DEALERSHIP BUT THIS TIME WITH A DVD COPY OF THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD TAKEN WITH MY MOVIE CAMERA. THIS DVD SHOWS THE ISSUE PERFECTLY. THEY RESPONDED THAT A TOYOTA TECH HAS FOUND AN \"UPGRADE\" THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE ME FOR $240 LABOR. THEY COMMENTED THAT MY CAR HAD 52,000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST STARTED SO THEY'RE BEING REALLY NICE IN PROVIDING THE PART \"UPGRADE\".

I TOLD THEM THAT THE POWER-TRAIN IS WARRENTED FOR 100,000 MILES AND IF THIS ISN'T A POWER-TRAIN ISSUE I DON'T  KNOW WHAT IS. FUTHERMORE, THEY MAY REGARD IT AS AN \"UPGRADE\" BUT I REGARD IT AS A SAFETY DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY TOYOTA AT NO CHARGE.  I HAVE A COPY OF THE DVD, CLEARLY SHOWING THE ISSUE, THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TO YOU.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

MY MAIN COMPLAINT, THOUGH, IS THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF OVERRIDE SYSTEM BUILT INTO THE 2008 PRIUS SO THAT, WHEN YOU DRIVE OVER CERTAIN POTHOLES OR BUMPS IN THE ROAD -- BUT NOT ALL OF THEM -- AND YOUR FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN, THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY SPEEDS UP TO MOVE YOU OUT OF THE POTHOLE OR OVER THE BUMP.  THIS OVERRIDES THE BRAKES SO THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU COULD RUN INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU IF IT WAS STOPPED OR INTO SOMETHING BLOCKING THE ROAD OR A GARAGE DOOR.  IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE BRAKING TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN, WHETHER YOU ARE GOING DOWN A HILL, AROUND A CURVE OR COMING UP TO A RED LIGHT OR STOP SIGN.  YOU HAVE YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THE CAR SPEEDS UP MOMENTARILY.  THERE IS A SQUARE METAL PLATE THAT IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE TARMAC IN THE ROAD ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM MY HOUSE.  THE ROAD IS A CANYON ROAD SO IT IS A HILLSIDE ROAD THAT IS VERY NARROW.  EVERY MORNING WHEN I DRIVE TO WORK, I HAVE TO DRIVE OVER THAT PLATE AND, EVERY TIME I DO, MY CAR SPEEDS UP.  THIS HAPPENS WITH OTHER 2008 PRIUSES THAT FRIENDS HAVE, IT'S NOT JUST MINE.  IT IS VERY SCARY AND EVERYONE I KNOW WHO HAS A 2008 PRIUS KNOWS THAT IT IS A BAD DESIGN FLAW THAT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT OR INJURY.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STOP THE OVERRIDE SYSTEM.  IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.",

ALL INCIDENTS HAPPENED ON EXTREMELY HOT DAYS (TEMPERATURES NEAR 100) IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER THE CAR HAD BEEN PARKED OUT IN THE SUN AND WITHOUT US HAVING MADE ANY ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH THE SHIFTER / DRIVE SELECTOR WHILE DRIVING.  THIS CREATED DANGEROUS SITUATIONS SEVERAL TIMES AS THE CAR ERRATICALLY SLOWED AS WE ENTERED INTERSECTIONS OR PULLED OUT ONTO BUSY STREETS.  OUR INITIAL RESPONSE WAS TO DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR, BUT WHEN THIS HAD NO EFFECT, WE DISCOVERED THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT HAD MOVED FROM D TO N.  IT WAS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS WHEN MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS ON BUSY STREETS WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  WE DISCOVERED THAT WE COULD KEEP THE CAR MOVING BY CONSTANTLY HOLDING THE SHIFTER / DRIVE SELECTOR LEVER IN THE D POSITION.  TURNING OFF THE AIR CONDITIONER DID NOT HELP THE PROBLEM.  AFTER THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM, BUT THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS THERE WERE UNABLE TO REPRODUCE IT.  THIS GLITCH REMAINS A CONCERN TO US BECAUSE THE LOSS OF POWER AND ACCELERATION IS UNPREDICTABLE AND THEREFORE DANGEROUS, BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW WE CAN KEEP THE CAR MOVING BY HOLDING THE SHIFTER IN THE D POSITION.

UPON TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF AND BACK ON USING THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH ON THE TURN SIGNAL HANDLE, THE LIGHT(S) WILL COME BACK ON.  THE ISSUE BEGAN IN LATE 2009 AND HAS CONTINUED TO OCCUR ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME WHEN THE CAR IS USED AT NIGHT.  IT IS USUALLY LIMITED TO ONE HEADLIGHT OR THE OTHER AND FAILURE OF BOTH LIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME HAS ONLY BEEN SEEN ONCE.    TOYOTA CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS STATED TO MYSELF (AND OTHER OWNERS) THAT THE ISSUE IS \"PREMATURE FAILURE\" OF THE HID (HIGH-INTENSITY DISCHARGE) HEADLIGHTS INSTALLED ON 2006 - 2008 MODEL PRIUSES.  THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND ARE OFFERING \"DISCOUNTED\" LIGHTS FOR ONLY $150 EACH, WITH NO DISCOUNT OFFERED FOR THE LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE LAMPS, WHICH REQUIRES REMOVAL OF THE BUMPER.  THE VEHICLE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER TYPE OF BULB (SUCH AS THE HALOGEN BULBS THAT ARE STANDARD ON THE NEWER PRIUS MODELS), SO OWNERS ARE FORCED TO PAY TOYOTA AN INCREDIBLY HIGH FEE (EVEN AFTER THE DISCOUNT) TO GET THEIR CARS SAFELY BACK ON THE ROAD.  I HAVE NOT HAD THE ISSUE RESOLVED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST.    THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN OBSERVED AND DOCUMENTED BY HUNDREDS OF OWNERS ON THE PRIUSCHAT.COM FORUM AND HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS MORE ON OTHER WEBSITES.  PREVIOUS NHTSA INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTED THAT THIS PROBLEM MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN AS MANY AS 100,000 VEHICLES.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH BY THE MANUFACTURER.    THE ISSUE IS APPARENTLY RESOLVED IN 2009 AND LATER MODELS BECAUSE THE HID LAMPS WERE REPLACED WITH HALOGEN, BUT THE DANGER OF HEADLIGHT FAILURE ON EARLIER MODELS WILL REMAIN HIGH UNTIL TOYOTA MAKES THE EARLIER MODELS COMPATIBLE WITH MORE RELIABLE HEADLIGHTS.    ALL OF THIS ASSUMES TOYOTA IS BEING FORTHRIGHT IN THEIR CLAIM THAT THE HID BULBS ARE THE CULPRIT.  IF THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE, CONSUMERS SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE MADE AWARE OF THAT, AS WELL. *TR",

THEY WERE GOING TO CHECK IT OUT, BUT DUE TO THE FACT OF AN ACCIDENT, THEY HAD OUR SON CALL TOYOTA TO GIVE THEM A REPORT OF WHAT HAPPENED.  TOYOTA SAID THEY WOULD SEND A REP. TO EXAMINE THE CAR, WHICH THEY WOULD NOT BE THERE FOR 2 WEEKS.  WE WAITED AND THEY FINALLY ARRIVED AROUND AUGUST 4TH OR 5TH.  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND SAID WE COULD COME AND GET THE CAR, WHICH I WAS CONCERNED NOT KNOWING IF THERE WAS DEFECT OR NOT.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TOLD US TOYOTA TAKES ALL RESPONSIBILITY OUT OF THEIR HANDS.  I FELT THAT WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE THEY SELL TOYOTA VEHICLES.  ON AUGUST 12TH OUR SON CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE A LETTER COMING IN ABOUT 35 DAYS.  WE ARE STILL WAITING AND FEEL THE DEALERSHIP AND TOYOTA HAS DONE NOTHING BUT PASS THE BUCK.  WE ALSO PURCHASED ANOTHER PRIUS AT THE SAME TIME.  BY THE WAY THEY BOTH TOLD MY SON IN THE BEGINNING THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL.  AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED OUR SON REALIZED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE WITH THE CAR AND THOUGHT IT WAS HIM, UNTIL THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED.  WE FEEL THAT THERE IS ALSO AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH THIS CAR BECAUSE THERE HAS 2 NEW BATTERIES INSTALLED IN THE CAR SINCE PURCHASED IN 2008.  WE JUST WANT ANSWERS!!!!!  THERE WAS $1800 DOLLARS DAMAGE SUSTAINED WITH THIS ACCIDENT.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HERE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WITH SOME ANSWERS. *TR",

I WOULD NORMALLY PUT THE THOUGHT OUT OF MY MIND SINCE I WEAR GLASSED TO READ, AND I FIGURED THAT MAYBE I JUST NEED REGULAR GLASSES.      ABOUT A MONTH AGO THINGS CHANGED WHILE MY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING FROM ATLANTA, GA., TO PENSACOLA, FLA. TO VISIT FAMILY.  ABOUT 15 MINUTES FROM OUR DESTINATION, A SHERIFF PULLED US OVER, INFORMED, US THAT ONE OF OUR HEADLIGHTS WAS OUT AND ALMOST GAVE US A TICKET.  SINCE WE OBVIOUSLY HAD NO IDEA THAT ONE OF OUR LIGHTS WAS OUT, HE GAVE US A WARNING INSTEAD.  THE NEXT MORNING I OPENED THE HOOD TO SEE IF THERE WAS A LOOSE CONNECTION.  WHEN I TURNED THE LIGHTS ON TO TEST THEM, THEY WERE WORKING AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUE.  EVERY TIME THAT I STARTED OUR PRIUS WHILE WE WERE IN FLORIDA I CHECKED THE LIGHTS AND THEY WERE BOTH ON.  THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES, AFTER WE HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR 30 MINUTES OR SO THAT I WOULD CHECK THE LIGHTS BEFORE TURNING THE CAR OFF AND THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT WAS OUT.  I TRIED TURNING THE LIGHT-SWITCH OFF AND THEN ON AND SOME TIMES THE PASSENGER HEADLIGHT WOULD TURN ON AND OTHER TIMES IT WOULD STAY OFF.  SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE CHECKED OUR HEADLIGHTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND FOUND EITHER THE PASSENGER HEADLIGHT WAS OUT OR THE DRIVER'S SIDE HEADLIGHT WAS OUT.  TURNING THE SWITCH OFF AND THEN BACK ON WOULD SOMETIMES CAUSE THE LIGHT TO COME BACK ON BUT OTHER TIMES IT WOULD CAUSE THAT LIGHT TO COME BACK ON AND THE OTHER HEADLIGHT TO TURN OFF.  OTHER TIMES, BY TURNING THE LIGHT-SWITCH OFF AND THEN BACK ON, BOTH LIGHTS WOULD TURN OFF.     THIS IS FRUSTRATING FOR ME AND WORRIES ME GREATLY SINCE MY WIFE IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF OUR PRIUS.  I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BOTH HEADLIGHTS WOULD TURN OFF WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AT NIGHT ON A DARK STREET OR HIGHWAY.

WHY DID IT THEN START MAKING TWO DIFFERENT BEEPING SOUNDS? WE THEN PULLED OVER AND FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION INDICATED THAT IT HAD JUMPED INTO REVERSE EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS STILL GOING FORWARD. WE HAD NOT TOUCHED THE SHIFT LEVER, BOTH HANDS WERE ON THE WHEEL. IT JUMPED INTO REVERSE BY ITSELF.     4.WHY , AFTER WE THEN RETURNED THE SHIFT TO DRIVE, WERE WE ABLE TO GO FURTHER UP THE HILL AND THE LOUD BEEPING STARTED AGAIN WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WAS STILL IN DRIVE? WE STOPPED THE CAR AND KEPT A FOOT ON THE  BRAKE PEDAL UNTIL HELP ARRIVED. AAA CAME. AAA DROVE THE CAR WITHOUT BEEPING TO A MORE LEVEL PART OF THE STREET TO LOAD IT UPON A TRUCK AND CARRIED THE CAR TO THE SAN FRANCISCO GEARY TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER.

I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER PRIUS OWNERS THAT THEY HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEIR HEADLIGHTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD THE REPLACEMENT COST FOR THE HEADLIGHT IS $300.00. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE, NONETHELESS HEADLIGHTS IN EVERYOTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED SEEM TO HAVE A LIFE OF 10 OR MORE YEARS. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I DRIVE TO WORK EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN IT IS DARK AND I SOMETIMES DON'T RETURN HOME UNTIL AFTER DARK. THE BULK OF MY DRIVING HAS BEEN IN THE DAYLIGHT, HOWEVER I NEED MY CAR TO GET TO WORK.   ALSO ON 3 OCCASIONS MY CRUISE CONTROL ACCELERATED BEYOND WHERE I SET IT. FOR EXAMPLE I RESET THE CONTROL AFTER HAVING HIT THE BRAKES. I GOT BACK TO MY SPEED AND SET THE CRUISE CONTROL AT 70MPH. I NOTICED A SHORT WHILE LATER THE CAR WAS GOING 95. I HIT THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT OF CRUISE CONTROL AND SLOWED DOWN AS IT SHOULD. I NOW TAKE THE CAR ALL THE WAY OUT OF CRUISE CONTROL SHUTTING IT OFF AFTER I HIT THE BRAKES. I NEXT TURN THE CONTROL BACK ON AND RESET THE CRUISE. USING THE CRUISE THIS WAY I HAVE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM OF THE CAR SPEEDING UP. II FIGURE I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE CRUISE THIS WAY AND OBSERVE WHETHER THERE IS ANY PROBLEM. HOWEVER,I DON'T BELIEVE TOYOTA INTENDED FOR THE CRUISE CONTROL TO BE USED THIS WAY. THANK YOU *TR",

THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A BRAKE PROBLEM.  I HAD TWO WITNESSES MY 16 AND 19 YEAR OLD CHILDREN.  A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE ACCELERATION HAPPENED AGAIN WITH MY 49 YEAR OLD FINANCE IN THE CAR.  IT WAS AN IN TOWN ACCELERATION ON THE ROAD IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE (HOOKER AVENUE).  AGAIN, I REGAINED CONTROL IN A FEW MINUTES, BUT PARTIALLY WENT THROUGH A RED LIGHT BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO STOP.

HELLO AND TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:  I PURCHASED A 2008 PRIUS ON MAY 14, 2008 AND EXPERIENCED WITHIN ONE MONTH OF BUYING THIS PRIUS, AN ISSUE WITH THE BRAKES.  I TRIED BRAKING AS I PULLED UP TO MY GARAGE IN ORDER TO PARK MY CAR IN FRONT OF IT LIKE I USUALLY DO, THE BRAKE ACTED \"IFFY\" AND THE CAR WENT RIGHT INTO MY GARAGE DOOR!  ORIGINALLY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS MY FAULT, BUT I KNEW I HAD HIT THE BRAKES CORRECTLY LIKE I DID IN THE PAST AND SWEAR SOMETHING MUST OF ACTED-UP. A COUPLE MONTHS LATER I EXPERIENCED SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN, IN A TARGET STORE PARKING LOT WHERE THE BRAKE WAS ACTING, \"IFFY.\" WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR INTO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR THE 5000 MILES CHECK-UP I HAD EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS, BUT THIS WAS BEFORE ANY \"RECALL\" NOTICE WHAT-SO-EVER!!  I HAVE BEEN BACK TO TOYOTA FOR MY EVERY 5000 MILES CHECK-UP SINCE, AND ALWAYS INQUIRE ABOUT THAT SITUATION AS I HOPE THEY DOCUMENT MY CONCERNS.  KNOCK ON WOOD, I HAVE NOT HAD THIS HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT IT DID HAPPEN, AND I HAVE A NEW GARAGE DOOR AND SCRAPED FRONT FENDER TO SHOW FOR IT!  WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE \"RECALL\" I JUST KNEW IT WAS NOT ME NOR MY IMAGINATION HERE!!!  I AM SEEKING REPAIR/DAMAGE COMPENSATION FOR THE FRONT FENDER AND GARAGE DOOR REPLACEMENT!

I HAVE NOT SEEN A 2008 INCLUDED IN THE NEWS, BUT MY EXPERIENCE SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN REPORTING.    WHILE DRIVING TO WORK ON SNOW PACKED ROADS I WAS MAKING A TURN INTO THE BUSINESS PARK WHERE I WORK.  THE CORNER WAS GOING NORMALLY UNTIL I HIT THE DRAINAGE DIP IN THE INTERSECTION.  AT THIS TIME I FEEL THAT I LOST ALL BRAKING WITH THE VEHICLE.      THE STREET WAS COVERED WITH PACKED FRESH SNOW, BUT NO ICE.  I HAD BEEN DRIVING IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON THE 20 MILE DRIVE INTO WORK WITH NO ISSUES OR TRACTION PROBLEMS AT ANY INTERSECTION OR CORNER.  WHEN I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND THAT I WAS NOT SLOWING I QUICKLY TRIED TO LET OFF THE BRAKES AND THEN REAPPLY THEM BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN AT ALL REGARDLESS IF I WAS PRESSING THE BRAKES OR NOT.  NO PUMPING SOUND FROM ANTILOCK BRAKES, NO TRACTION WARNING LIGHT, NO SLOWING OF THE CAR - NOTHING AT ALL. IT FELT LIKE THE BRAKES WERE NOT RESPONDING TO MY PUSH OF THE PEDAL IN ANY WAY.    LUCKILY I WAS NOT GOING FAST AT ALL (I WOULD ESTIMATE WELL UNDER 10MPH), SO THIS HAPPENED OVER A VERY SHORT DISTANCE. I DID STRIKE A CURB THAT WAS PART OF AN ISLAND AND CRACKED A RIM BUT NO DAMAGE TO THE STEERING THAT AN ALIGNMENT DID NOT RESOLVE.  I HAD TO REPLACE ALL OF THE RIMS SINCE THE LOCAL DEALER HAD TO ORDER THEM IN AND I NEEDED MY CAR TO GET TO WORK.  I WAS VERY LUCKY THAT THERE WAS AN ISLAND AND THAT I DID NOT CRASH INTO ANOTHER CAR IN THE OTHER LANE OR WORSE A PEDESTRIAN.  I REALIZE THAT I WAS ON PACKED SNOW AT THE TIME AND AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING FOR THE DAMAGES TO THE WHEEL FROM TOYOTA - BUT JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT THE BRAKING ISSUE MAY BE MORE THAN THE CURRENT MODEL YEAR.  I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A LOSS OF CONTROL IN A CAR BEFORE IN ANY ROAD CONDITIONS EVER.  IT WAS A LOSS OF ANY ABILITY TO BRAKE OR EVEN SLOW THE CAR. I HOPE THIS INFORMATION HELPS YOU AND THAT TOYOTA IS TESTING THE SOFTWARE FOR OLDER PRIUS MODELS TOO. *TR",

MAJOR PROBLEM - IF QUICKLY ACCELERATING, ENGINE WILL LOSE POWER WITH FAST PLUMMET IN MPH. FEELS LIKE THE ENGINE HAS DIED. EVENTUALLY WITH CATCH AFTER IT FEELS LIKE IT HAS STALLED AND WILL JERK AND THEN SLOWLY ACCELERATE AGAIN. IF ACCELETERATING TO AVOID BEING HIT THIS MAKES THE SITUATION MUCH WORSE. I BELIEVE THAT THE ROOT OF ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS IS EITHER TRACTION CONTROL OF VSC. YELLOW ICON FLASHES ON DASHBOARD WHEN BRAKE POWER LOST ON BUMPY ROADS.

I HAVE BROUGHT MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT EACH HEADLIGHT COSTS NEAR $200/EACH AND WOULD REQUIRE AN HOUR AND A HALF LABOR TO REPLACE THEM AS THE FRONT BUMPER NEEDS TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHTS BRINGING THE TOTAL REPLACEMENT COST TO NEAR $600.

THEY THEN TOLD ME THAT THE 1/2 PRICE OFFER 'COULD' BE RETRACTED IF I WASN'T HAPPY WITH IT.  TOYOTA WASN'T GOING TO WASTE \"GOOD WILL\" MONEY ON A CUSTOMER THAT STILL WASN'T HAPPY WITH THEIR OFFER. I INDICATED AT THAT TIME THAT I WANTED TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT WHEN I CALLED THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY, I WAS TOLD THAT THE OFFER HAD BEEN RETRACTED DUE TO A CALL FROM TOYOTA N.A..  I NEVER INDICATED TO THEM THAT I WASN'T GOING TO TAKE THE OFFER BUT I DO BELIEVE TOYOTA HAS A SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ON 2006 ' 2009 PRIUS CARS. I HAVE RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND FOUND NUMEROUS OWNERS WITH THE SAME DEFECT! I ALSO HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF A PRIUS CAR WITH DEFECTIVE HEADLIGHTS THAT HAVE FAILED TWICE IN THE 1ST TWO YEARS OF OWNERSHIP WITH AS LITTLE AS 45,000 MILES ON THE CAR!  THAT PRIUS IS ON IT THIRD SET OF HEADLIGHTS! *TR",

THE DEALER REPLACED THE HEADLIGHTS BUT NOT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE ON MY PART.  LAST POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT THIS 2008 PRIUS HAS THE SAME EXACT ISSUES WITH BRAKES AND STOPPING THAT THE 2010 DOES ACCORDING THE  ACCOUNTS I HAVE READ.  FOR EXAMPLE, I WENT OVER A RAILROAD TRACK RECENTLY WHICH WHEN IT HITS AN UNEVEN SURFACE IT IS VERY HARD TO STOP!  I ALMOST HIT A CAR THAT WAS TURNING JUST PAST THESE TRACKS BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD \"GRIP\" TO THE ROAD.  IT HAPPENS ALSO WITH EVEN A SMALL CLUSTER OF SMALL POT HOLES.  THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE IN MY OPINION.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE HEADLIGHTS ALONE DID NOT MAKE A RECALL.  IT IS AN ONGOING UNSAFE SITUATION.

BEFORE WE TURNED THE WHEEL TO THE LEFT TO BEGIN THE TURN, THE CAR HAD SPED ACROSS THE 35 FOOT STREET, JUMPED A 6 1/2 INCH CURB, WENT THROUGH A FENCE, ACROSS ANOTHER STREET, AND WAS STOPPED WHEN IT HIT A SECOND FENCE. THE TOTAL DISTANCE TRAVELED FROM BEING STOPPED AT THE CORNER UNTIL THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED BY THE SECOND FENCE WAS 81 FEET.  THE STREETS WERE DRY AND THERE WERE NO SKID MARKS ON THE ROAD. HOWEVER, DUE TO PREVIOUS RAINS, THE GRASS AREAS WERE MOIST. THERE ARE NO TIRE MARKS IN THE GRASS FROM THE CURB UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET BEFORE THE STOPPING POINT.  THE FRONT LIFT OF THE PRIUS IS AROUND 7 1/2 INCHES. THE VEHICLE HAD TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT MOMENTUM TO GO OVER A 6 1/2 INCH CURB IN JUST 35 FEET.  WE FILED A CLAIM WITH OUR INSURANCE ON JAN. 7 AND REQUESTED THAT THE VEHICLE BE INSPECTED FOR ACCELERATOR ISSUES.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO TOYOTA WHOM, UPON THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION, STATED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ACCELERATION MALFUNCTION. THE CAR IS BEING REPAIRED AT A BODY SHOP WITH INITIAL DAMAGE ESTIMATED AT OVER $6000.  WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR AS WELL AS THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT AND MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCES TRAVELED.  IN 2009, WE RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM TOYOTA CONCERNING FLOOR MAT ISSUES WITH OUR PRIUS. WE INSPECTED OUR FACTORY-INSTALLED FLOOR MATS, AS INSTRUCTED BY THE RECALL LETTER, AND WERE AWAITING THEIR 2ND NOTIFICATION WHEN THE \"CAMPAIGN REMEDY\" BECAME AVAILABLE. THE FLOOR MAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAS A LOCKING MECHANISM AND COULD HAVE, IN NO WAY, OBSTRUCTED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  THE CAR SHOULD BE REPAIRED AND READY NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS A SAFE VEHICLE TO DRIVE.  WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE?  *TW *TR",

AFTER I PAID FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BULB, THE SERVICE MANAGER GAME ME A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER TO CALL AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE BULB. NO ONE ANSWERED. I WENT HOME AND CHECKED THE VARIOUS BLOGS ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH THE TOYOTA  PRIUS. THE HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO BE DEFECTIVE.  EXCLUDING THE INFLATED COST OF A LIGHT BULB, THIS HAS TO BE A SAFETY CONCERN FOR TOYOTA.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS I PAID JUST OVER $401.00 TO REPLACE A $10.00 LIGHT BULB.   THAT IS JUST PLAIN WRONG AND SOMEONE SHOULD HOLD TOYOTA RESPONSIBLE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN THIS MATTER.  DENNIS BENNETT *TR",

I WAS ATTEMPTING TO FILL MY NEARLY EMPTY GAS TANK, WHEN THE GAS NOZZLE CLICKED OFF AFTER ABOUT 2 SECONDS OF FILLING. I REPEATEDLY TRIED TO CONTINUE FILLING ONLY TO HAVE THE NOZZLE REPEATEDLY CLICK OFF WITHOUT FILLING ANY FURTHER. I WOULD SQUEEZE THE HANDLE, A LITTLE GAS WOULD GO INTO THE CAR AND THE NOZZLE WOULD CLICK OFF. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF THIS FRUSTRATION, I REMOVED THE NOZZLE FROM THE CAR AND WHATEVER GASOLINE WAS IN THE TANK CAME GUSHING OUT OF THE GAS TANK. A LOT OF GAS, POURED DOWN THE SIDE OF MY NEW CAR AND ONTO MYSELF. AFTER THIS, THE GAS GAUGE WAS APPARENTLY STUCK ON ?FULL?, AS I DROVE THE CAR A ABOUT 100 MILES AND THE GAS GAUGE REMAINED AT THE ?FULL? SETTING EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOT EVEN PUT IN 3 GALLONS OF GAS IN MY SEEMINGLY EMPTY TANK. WITH MOST EVERY SUBSEQUENT FILL AFTER THIS IT WOULD TAKE FOREVER TO FILL THE TANK WITH THE NOZZLE CONSTANTLY CLICKING OFF?PLUS IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHEN THE TANK IS ACTUALLY FULL. THE GAS HAS CONTINUED TO POUR OUT ONTO MY CAR AND MYSELF ON OCCASIONAL FILLS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 5 MONTHS. I'VE PUT 16,000 MILES ON MY PRIUS AND IT HAS MOST ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME ROUTINE WHEN FUELING?THE NOZZLE CONSTANTLY CLICKING OFF AND ME STANDING THERE SQUEEZING THE NOZZLE HANDLE OVER AND OVER AND TRYING TO GUESS WHEN THE TANK IS ACTUALLY FULL. I OFTEN COULD NOT PUT MORE THAN ONE SECOND OF FUEL IN MY PRIUS BEFORE THE FUEL NOZZLE WOULD CLICK OFF AND I KEEP HAVING TO PULL THE PUMP SPIGOT OUT UNTIL IT JUST BARELY SQUIRTS GAS PAST THE LITTLE FLAPPER DOOR, AND EVEN THEN IT KEEPS SHUTTING OFF.  IT TAKES ME ALMOST 20 MINUTES TO PUT LESS THAN 6 GALLONS OF GAS IN THIS CAR AND IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND A SAFETY CONCERN TO CONTINUE HAVING GAS POUR OUT OF THE TANK TO THE GROUND AND ONTO MY CLOTHING/BODY.

THE DESIGN FLAW  WITH THE VEHICLE THAT I AM ABOUT TO REPORT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE DEATH OR BODILY INJURY IF IT'S NOT CORRECTED RIGHT THE WAY.  THE ISSUE IS THAT IF YOU DRIVE THE CAR AT NIGHT AND THE INTERIOR DIMMER IS TURNED WAY UP, YOU COULD SEE A LINE OF BLUE LIGHT ABOUT 6 INCHES LONG RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD, ON THE DRIVER SIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE LIGHT THAT YOU SEE ON THE WINDSHIELD IS THE RESULT OF THE LIGHT REFLECTION FROM THE ODOMETER.     THE LIGHT ON THE WINDSHIELD IS A DISTRACTION FOR DRIVERS.  I GOT DISTRACTED BY LOOKING AT THIS LIGHT WHILE DRIVING, AND ALMOST GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT ON 03/15/08.      IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND OUT THAT THE LIGHT REFLECTION ON THE WINDSHIELD GOES AWAY IF THE DIMMER IS TURNED WAY DOWN.
