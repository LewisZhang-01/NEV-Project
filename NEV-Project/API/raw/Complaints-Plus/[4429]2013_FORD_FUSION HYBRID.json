I read other people with the same year, make, model, and engine also had the same issue - coolant vanishing causing the car to overheat and stall, some resulting in fire. I believe this is due to the coolant leaking into the hot exhaust system as safety recall 12S41 describes.

This caused about $7,000.00 in damage but could have easily gotten out of control and caused injury or death to occupant(s).  I reached out to Ford Motor Company and did a chat log asking for assistance and to make them aware. Ford Motor Company Case number CAS-34734107-H6J0Z5.   What is dangerous about this design is that Ford chose to design and install a secondary high pressure fuel pump directly above the exhaust manifold and the engineers surely would have known the durability and longevity along with possible outcomes due to normal use over time. For the same reason you are not to refuel a hot engine, a fuel pump should not be placed directly over the exhaust manifold. I believe Ford Motor Company should be held accountable for their finished product liability. This is dangerous enough that they should remove these vehicles from service until a safe solution is available and deployed in my opinion.",

Most complaints on NHTSA regarding cooling have the same symptoms as our car. Both recalls are a safety hazard causing the engine to catch fire and endanger driver/passengers.  I have no way of confirming the work was performed as we were previously advised and yet Ford will not take responsibility to ensure the current issue is not related to the recalls and perform the necessary repairs. I was told by a Supervisor, Jennifer, at Ford's Customer Care Line (800-392-3673) that NHTSA  must tell Ford to add this to their (Ford's) system in order for it to be addressed.",

While the recall was not issued for the 2013 Ford Fusion Energi Titanium Hybrid 2.0 liter engines, the problems identified with the 1.6 liter engines also characterize many of the 2.0 liter engines, including the one that I drive.  My Ford has had 18 recalls, and during 2020 the engine light came on 4 different times between February and October of 2020 in which I brought the vehicle to Serramonte Ford service center to determine the reason.  Ford did routine inspections and recall work in each visit, but it was not until the final time that the engine light came on that the tech looked inside the engine to discover leaking oil that Ford's service staff informed me I would require a new engine.  Ford suggests replacing the defective engine with a rebuilt engine rather than breaking down and diagnosing the cause of the oil in the engine block, according to Ford due to the relatively cheaper cost to me (Ford did not make the diagnosis until after the car was out of warranty) of installing a rebuilt engine rather than tearing down the existing engine to diagnose and repair.  I suspect that the 2.0 liter engine has the exact same issues as the 1.6 and should have been included in the 2017 recall, when I could have had the coolant level sensor installed while the car remained under the manufacturer's warranty.  The car is at risk of a catastrophic fire now if I drive it off of the service center's lot, where it has been since November 2020.  12S41 and 17S09 recalls should be offered to the 2.0 liter engine models as well, before more people die.",

I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 20 MPH AND HEARD A DULL THUD (I WAS TOLD LATER THIS WAS PROBABLY MY ENGINE POPPING). I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO A SHOP TO HAVE THE CODE READ (P0302). I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AT 7 AM THE NEXT MORNING (14 HOURS AFTER THE LIGHT CAME ON). THEY DIAGNOSED THE CAR AND CALLED ME TO TELL ME THERE WAS AN INTERNAL COOLANT LEAK IN THE ENGINE AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE CAR WAS A TOTAL ENGINE REPLACEMENT. THEY QUOTED ME AT 8500$ (MORE THAN THE AMOUNT I PURCHASED THE CAR FOR) AND TOLD ME MULTIPLE TIMES THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO TO FIX IT. I FOUND OUT AFTER MY FAMILY CHECKED OUT THE CAR THAT THE LEAK HAD CAUSED A CRACKED HEAD GASKET AND THE SPARK PLUGS IN THE CYLINDER WERE CONTAMINATED FROM THE COOLANT. THE FORD ECOBOOST 1.6L ENGINE HAS AN OPEN RECALL FOR CAUSING ENGINE FIRES BECAUSE OF AN INTERNAL COOLANT LEAK, BUT THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DESIGN FLAW IN THE ENGINE THAT CAUSE COOLANT LEAKS LED TO THE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO MY ENGINE. THEY TOLD ME I COULD DRIVE THE CAR OFF THE LOT SINCE I WAS NOT COMPLETING THE REPAIR THERE, BUT I COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE PARKING LOT AND HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MY HOUSE. THE CAR WAS SHAKING AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS FLASHING, WHICH IT HAD NOT BEEN WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN.

WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2016 WITH 38,233 MILES ON IT.   WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT FAITH'S FORD IN BRATTLEBORO VERMONT ON MONDAY THE 26TH FOR A POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT. ON TUESDAY, WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM XXX]SERVICE MANAGER, AND HE INFORMED US THAT THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING RACK HAS HAD A PREMATURE FAILURE AND THAT THE REPLACEMENT WOULD COST $1900.00.  WE HAVE CONTACTED THE OWNER OF FAITHS FORD AND NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2012 FUSIONS FOR THE STEERING RACK, BUT OUR VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BUILT AT THE SAME PLANT, DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD, AS THE RECALL ORIGINATED FROM (15S18) IN HERMOSILLO MEXICO.  OUR VEHICLE, VIN NUMBER [XXX] 69,520 MILES ON IT WHEN IT FAILED. WE ARE STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT WITH OVER $6000.00 LEFT TO THE LOAN AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT.  IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE CONTACT FORD CORPORATE OFFICE ABOUT THE ISSUE WHICH WE DID, HOWEVER THEY MAINTAIN THAT OUR CAR WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO. THEY TOLD US TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A DIAGNOSIS, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD EXPLAINED THAT WE HAD ALREADY DONE THAT VERY THING. THEY SUGGESTED WE CONTACT THE NHTSA AND FILE A COMPLAINT.

DESPITE FULL COVERAGE, GAP INSURANCE, AND FIRE CASUALTY INSURANCE THEY COULD NOT PAY OUT FOR A NEW ENGINE. ONLY THE FIRE DAMAGE DONE UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTHING ELSE. THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED I NEEDED AN ENTIRELY NEW ENGINE PUT IN AND THAT IT WOULD COST 7,000.00. I HAD THIS CAR LESS THEN 6 MONTHS WHEN IT CAUGHT FIRE. I ALSO HAVE 11,000.00+ LOAN OUT ON THIS CAR. I FILED A CLAIM WITH FORD MOTOR AND THEY HAVE IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS. I AM UNABLE TO GET ANOTHER LOAN DUE TO ALREADY HAVING AN OPEN CAR LOAN AND NOT ENOUGH CREDIT. I LOST MY JOB AS A RESULT TO NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A RENTAL AFTER BLOWING THROUGH MY ENTIRE SAVINGS FOR ONE. I TEMPORARILY LOST CUSTODY OF MY SON DUE TO NOT TRANSPORTATION TO HIS SCHOOL.

WE HAVE TAKEN TO GARY CROSSLEY FORD IN KC, MO. THEY ALSO AGREE THERE IS SHOTTY MECHANICAL WORK DONE TO THE ENGINE REPAIR DUE TO RECALL? WE HAVE BEEN 2 WEEKS WITH NO WORD ON HOW THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO BE RESOLVED AND ARE WITHOUT A CAR? I NEED SOME ANSWERS? THE ENGINE WAS NOT ALIGNED CORRECTLY AND SEALANT WAS PUT IN PLACES IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WHEN REPLACED.

THIS RESULTS IN A DIAGONALLY ANGLED SEAT. I AM NOT A TALL PERSON, THEREFORE THIS ISSUES MAKES ME UNABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR.   I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND SEE SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE. WE BROUGHT IT INTO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED THE CAR AND THE COST FOR SAID ISSUE IS OVER $2,000.00. SEEMS LIKE IF MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE THEN THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. ALSO- I SEE THERE IS ANOTHER SEAT RECALL FROM 2014 (FRONT SEAT BACKREST REPLACEMENT) TO WHICH THE MOTOR AND SEAT ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS ARE REMOVED/REPLACED/OR ADJUSTED. LEADS ME TO THINK THIS MAY BE AN ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL.   I AM DISHING OUT THE COST OF THIS REPAIR..I DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION RIGHT NOW. BUT I AM GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ISSUES AND FORD DENYING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUES EVEN THOUGH SEVERAL FORD CUSTOMERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.

MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE IN THE CAR, AND THE ISSUE CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO HIT A BUSH AT MY DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL, BECAUSE WHEN I HIT THE GAS, THE CAR WENT BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS INTO A PARKING SPOT IN THE PARKING LOT.  I WAS ABLE TO BRAKE AND ENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THE INCIDENT, AND THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED NO BODY DAMAGE.  I GOOGLED THE ISSUE, AND WITH MY WIFE, WAS ABLE TO MANUALLY CHANGE THE GEAR IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT TO DRIVE, AND I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO OUR TRUSTED MECHANIC ABOUT A MILE AWAY.  MY GOOGLE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT SOME 2013 FORD FUSIONS WERE SUBJECT TO RECALL FOR THE ISSUE, SO I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP (ROUSH FORD) TO DETERMINE WHETHER MY VEHICLE WAS SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.  THE DEALERSHIP, AND LATER FORD CONFIRMED BY PHONE THAT MY VEHICLE, WITH ITS VIN, WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL.  THE FORD CASE NUMBER FOR MY REQUEST IS CAS16129095.

ONE TIME I WAS PULLING OUT FROM A STOP SIGN WHEN THIS NOISE STARTED AND THE CAR DIED WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC COMING RIGHT AT ME. OTHER TIMES IT'S JUST AN ANNOYANCE AN THE ENGINE RUNS FINE. WHEN I GOOGLED IT I'VE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL OTHER FORD FUSIONS WITH THE TURBO ENGINE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING OFF AND ON AGAIN FOR A YEAR AND A HALF NOW.

ON DECEMBER 24, 2017, I STARTED MY CAR AFTER TAKING MY OLDEST SON TO GET HIS HAIRCUT, WHEN MY FORD FUSION STARTED TO JERK, LOSE POWER, AND STEERING LOCKED WHEN WE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY FROM THE PARKING LOT.  I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT MY CAR, AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE, STARTED TO ACT UP, BUT SOMEWHAT GRATEFUL IT HAPPENED PRIOR TO LEAVING TOWN ON DECEMBER 26TH.   MY CAR HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE DECEMBER 26TH, AND I WAS FINALLY INFORMED OF THE HEFTY COST OF THE REPAIRS THIS WEEK (25 DAYS LATER), FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  AS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND, THIS IS VERY DISCOURAGING BECAUSE I ONLY NEED NINE MORE PAYMENTS TO PAY OFF THE CAR AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY GIVES OUT AND THE STEERING TEMPORARILY LOCKS BEFORE PAYING OFF THE CAR.    I'M PERPLEXED BY THE DENIAL FROM THE FORD MANUFACTURE COMPANY TO ASSIST IN THIS MATTER SINCE THIS IS A TRANSMISSION PRODUCT ISSUE.   PLEASE EXPLAIN, BECAUSE I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS:   IS THIS THE TYPICAL SHELF LIFE OF A 2013 FORD FUSION TRANSMISSION?  IF NOT, THEN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A MANUFACTURE DEFECT.  IF SO, THEN THE TRANSMISSION AND PRODUCT OF THIS MAKE AND MODEL IS NOT OF GOOD QUALITY.  IS THE DAMAGE FROM A CRACKED TRANSMISSION OR THE GEARS ARE DEFAULTING TO 5TH GEAR OR BOTH?  WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER AND ASSIST WITH PAYING THE COSTS OF THE TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTION. WHAT OTHER SOLUTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE AVAILABLE?",

AFTER ARGUING WITH FORD FOR SEVERAL DAYS, FORD INFORMED ME THAT THE ONLY THING THE RECALL WOULD COVER IS THE INSTALLATION OF A COOLANT SENSOR. BASICALLY ALL THEY WOULD OFFER IS TO INSTALL A SENSOR THAT WILL GIVE ME A HEADS UP THE NEXT TIME MY ENGINE IS GOING TO BLOW UP  FINALLY AFTER 6 WEEKS I PICKED THE CAR UP ON MAY 17. I STARTED TO DRIVE HOME, MADE IT ABOUT AN HOUR, WHEN MY ENGINE TEMPERATURE STARTED CLIMBING AND WARNING ME ABOUT OVERHEATING AGAIN. I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY, CHECKED THE COOLANT, LET IT COOL OFF AND TRIED AGAIN AND IT DID THE SAME THING WITHIN A FEW MINUTES.   I HAD IT TOWED TO ANOTHER FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE COOLANT BYPASS VALVE AND IT HAD TO BE REPLACED. COST ME ANOTHER $300.  SO TO SUMMARIZE THIS LENGTHY STORY: I HAVE A CAR THAT IS LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD WITH A RUINED ENGINE. FORD ADMITS THE CAR IS DEFECTIVE AND TENDS TO OVERHEAT AND RUIN THE ENGINE, YET THEY REFUSE TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I WAITED FOR SIX WEEKS AND PAID OVER 7400 FOR NEW ENGINE THAT DIDN'T EVEN LAST AN HOUR BEFORE OVERHEATING AGAIN AND COSTING ME ANOTHER 300.",

TODAY I WAS INFORMED VIA E-MAIL THAT THE RECALL IS FOR THE \"COOLANT SENSOR\" AND \"THIS DOES NOT COVER THE REPAIR TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER HEADS.\" I HAVE READ THE RECALL AND IT STATES VERY CLEARLY THAT THE DANGER OF THE RECALL IS OVERHEATING AND A CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD.    I DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE YET, BUT I HAVE BEEN ADVISED IT WILL COST ME THOUSANDS TO FIX.    THIS IS A CAR THAT IS LESS THAN FIVE YEARS OLD AND 72000 MILES, JUST OUT OF WARRANTY.

THESE INSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED ON CITY STREETS, AT SPEEDS UNDER 40 MPH.  WHEN IT OCCURS IT FEELS AS IF THE CAR IS SKIDDING, EVEN ON DRY PAVEMENT.  I WOULD ALSO DESCRIBE THE FEELING AS A SURGE, EVEN THOUGH THE CAR IS BRAKING, AND SHOULD BE SLOWING.  I HAVE ALSO DESCRIBED THIS AS A FEELING THAT THE BRAKES SLIP OR STOP WORKING MOMENTARILY AND THEN RE-ENGAGE.  THE EXPERIENCE IS FRIGHTENING, AND I AM CONCERNED THAT THE CAR COULD SURGE FORWARD WHILE I AM BRAKING AND RESULT IN A COLLISION OR INJURIES.  I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN 2013, AND HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR FEWER THAN 20,000 MILES.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE REGULARLY.  THESE SURGES RECENTLY HAVE SEEMED LONGER IN DURATION MORE RECENTLY.  I HAVE NOTED THIS CONCERN TO MY FORD DEALER TWICE IN THE LAST 12-15 MONTHS, AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE BRAKES FOR PROBLEMS.  EACH TIME, THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE SURGE OR SKIDDING SENSATION.  MOST RECENTLY, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE EXPLAINED THAT I WAS PROBABLY NOTICING THE GASOLINE ENGINE KICK BACK IN AFTER THE CAR WAS IN BATTERY/ELECTRIC DRIVE.  THIS EXPLANATION DOES NOT SQUARE WITH MY EXPERIENCE.  I CAN DETERMINE WHEN THE CAR SHIFTS FROM BATTERY TO ENGINE OPERATION, AND THAT IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THESE BRAKING EVENTS.  I READ THE COMPLAINTS OF A FEW OTHER FUSION 2013 HYBRID OWNERS WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM, AND I WANTED TO ADD THAT THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING IN OTHER VEHICLES.  THIS IS NOT A SAFE CONDITION.  I WILL AGAIN BE TAKING MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE, AND ASKING FOR FORD TO INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM.",

THEN AFTER TURNING ON THE HEATER AND NOW LEAVING FOR WORK, I ACCELERATE TO GET ONTO THE FREEWAY AND SOON NOTICED THAT THE HEATER IS NOW BLOWING COLD AIR AND I THEN TURN THE HEATER UP HIGHER TO 77 THEN THE SAME WARMTH COME OUT THEN THAT GOES AWAY TIL I TURN THE HEATER WAY UP TO 83 DEGREES.        THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, I HAD THE COOLANT AND OIL REPLACED AND IT IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING. I GET TWO WARNINGS SHOWING THE YELLOW WRENCH, \"POWER REDUCED TO COOL DOWN ENGINE\" AND \"ENGINE OVERHEAT\"              THE SUNNYVALE FORD DEALER CHARGED ME $200.00 DOLLARS TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR AND SAID THEY HAVE FOUND NOTHING. BUT THIS PROBLEM ONLY HAPPENS ON THE FREEWAY DRIVING AT 65 TO 75 MPH. OUR FREEWAYS SPEED LIMITS ARE HIGH ON INTERSTATES 5. I DO SEE OLDER FORD TEMPO'S GOING 80 MPH AND PASSING ME WHILE I CANNOT GO FASTER TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF OTHERS. QUITE INSULTING TO ME WHILE I SPEND OUT OF POCKET AND FORD SAYS NOTHING AND I GET BACK A BROKEN CAR THAT WORKS SOMETIMES.          THE EXTENDED WARRANTIES I PAY FOR DOES NOT COVER ANYTHING SO I'M PAYING FOR A CAR THAT IS SOON TO FAIL AND LEAVE ME STRANDED AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. FORD CONTINUE TO SAY MY CAR IS RUNNING WELL AND RETURNING IT BACK TO ME WITH PROBLEMS UNFIXED",

I COULD NOT DRIVE THE CAR WITHOUT THE REPAIR, THUS I WAS AT THE MERCY OF THE DEALER FOR A $533 BILL, WHICH I PAID.

WHILE DRIVING THESE ISSUES DISTRACT THE DRIVER FROM PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD AND CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THIS HAPPENS NO MATTER IF THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY OR AT ANY SPEED. FORD IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BUT SO FAR HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS IT . IN THE FORD FOURMS THERE ARE PROMISES OF A NEW UPDATE SOON B BUT SO FAR NOTHING HAS HABBENED. THE VERSION OF SOFTWARE AFFECTED ARE SYNV 4.4 AND GEN2 - VERSION 3.8. AS THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY INSTALLED IN ALMOST ALL FORD UNITS COULD YOU PLEASE GET THEM TO EITHER FIX THE ISSUES WITH THE SOFTWARE OR ALLOW DEALERS TO REINSTALL EARLIER VERSIONS THAT DID FUNCTION CORRECTLY",

ON OCTOBER 1, 2015, A NEW CONDITION CAUSED THE FEELING OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, AS MY WIFE WAS ON A SIDE STREET NEAR OUR HOME WHEN SHE WAS APPROACHING A STOP SIGN AND FELT THE POWER SURGE, WHICH SHE STATES WAS MANY TIMES WORSE THAN ANY OTHER INSTANCE OF THIS EVENT THAT SHE EVER EXPERIENCED.  CONDITIONS THIS TIME WERE THE SAME AS ABOVE BUT MOVING STRAIGHT AND LESS THAN 25 MPH.       WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP THE EVENING OF THE LAST INCIDENT.  OF COURSE THEY FOUND NO CODES AND NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING WRONG.  I ALSO CONTACTED THE FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER WHILE IT WAS IN THE SHOP TO DOCUMENT THAT WE HAD THIS PROBLEM.

ALLOWING SOME ONE TO DRIVE WITH DOORS THAT CAN COME LOOSE, WHEN 3/4 HAVE HAD A ISSUES. I DON'T FEEL SAFE. PLUS I AM PAYING FOR A CAR THAT IS NOT FULLY UP TO STANDARD. IT IS LIKE DRIVING A BOMB WITH A CLOCK THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL GO OFF. THE DEALERSHIP IS HIDING BEHIND BEING A FRANCHISE AND NOT PART OF FORD. PEOPLE'S SAFETY SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES. IF THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE ON THE ROAD IN THE SAME SITUATION. . THANKS CONCERN OWNER AND DRIVER",

THEY'VE IGNORED MY CONCERNS AND DISMISSED ME MULTIPLE TIMES,  STATING THAT IF NOTHING IS FOUND ON THE COMPUTER,  THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING.  IN OCTOBER,  I REFUSED TO LEAVE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT UNTIL SOMEONE CHECKED MY CONCERNS.  FINALLY,  A MECHANIC SAT IN MY CAR AND LISTENED TO THE LOUD RATTLING NOISE.  HE SAID \"THAT'S NOT NORMAL.\" UPON INSPECTION,  THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE FOUND 2 LOOSE CLIPS THAT ATTACH TO MY FUEL LINE.  I WAS TOLD THAT MY ENTIRE FUEL LINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED,  BUT THAT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER.  THEY SAID I NEEDED TO STILL DRIVE MY CAR DESPITE THE \"LOOSE CLIPS. \" I DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS,  BUT THEY SAID MY PART WOULD FINALLY BE HERE ON NOVEMBER 17, 2014. WHEN I CALLED AGAIN YESTERDAY, THEY SAID IT WAS STILL ON BACK ORDER! FROM WHAT I'M READING ABOUT THIS STEERING WHEEL LOCK PROBLEM,  IT SOUNDS LIKE MY PRIOR CONCERNS CAN ALL BE RELATED.  FORD SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RECALL FOR MY STEERING WHEEL PROBLEM AND ASKED ME TO DRIVE MY CAR THERE! I INFORMED THEM THAT MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED ON ME AND THAT I DID NOT FEEL SAFE!

ALL MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT THE DRIVER'S SEAT USING DBA SINCE THIS WEIGHTS THE SOUND TO MATCH THE CONTOUR OF THE HUMAN EAR. THE FORWARD SENSORS MEASURE AT 55 DBA WHICH IS AT THE MID-POINT OF NORMAL COMMUNICATION  (50-60 DBA) AND IS QUITE NOTICEABLE UNDER ALL CONDITIONS. THE REAR SAFETY ALERT MEASURES AT 40 DBA WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT ABOVE A SOFT WHISPER. NORMAL COMMUNICATION IS BETWEEN 10 AND 100 TIMES LOUDER. WHEN YOU GET IN YOUR HOT CAR IN A PARKING LOT THE A/C IS ON HIGH IT MEASURES 70 DBA. THIS IS WHEN YOU NEED THE SAFETY SYSTEM TO WORK WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT. PROBLEM IS THE NOISE FROM THE A/C IS 1,000 TIMES LOUDER THAN THE SAFETY ALERT RENDERING IT INAUDIBLE UNLESS YOU TURN YOUR HEAD AND LEAN INTO THE BACK SEAT AREA, THEN A FAINT SAFETY ALERT CAN BE HEARD. I COMPLAINED TO FORD AND THIS WAS ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER CAS-4970853. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST MY CAR BECAUSE A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A FUSION ENERGI SAME YEAR AND HIS IS A LITTLE LOUDER ABOUT 46 DBA.

IMMEDIATELY, I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO NO AVAILABLE POWER.  THE ENGINE REFUSED TO COMMUNICATION WITH THE ACCELERATOR AS THE RPM WOULD JUST INCREASE BUT NO ACTUAL POWER WAS GIVEN TO THE VEHICLE.  I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THE VEHICLE TO RESPOND BUT EVENTUALLY HAD TO PULL OVER BECAUSE NO POWER WAS AVAILABLE. EVEN AFTER SOMEHOW AVOID 3 LANES OF CONSTANT TRAFFIC, I ATTEMPTED TO START DRIVING AGAIN WITHOUT SHUTTING THE VEHICLE DOWN.  DURING THIS POINT ALL THAT WOULD STILL HAPPEN WAS THE VEHICLE WOULD REV THE RPM'S, BUT NOT PROPULSION WAS AVAILABLE.  I HAD TO SHUTDOWN THE CAR COMPLETELY ON THE HIGHWAY SHOULDER IN ORDER TO GET THE CAR TO RESPOND TO ANY TIME OF GAS DEMANDS.  I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE THROTTLE BODY ISSUE MANY CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING AND BELIEVE I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE LOSING POWER WHILE IN CRUISE CONTROL AT 75MPH CAN LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC RESULTS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE IT CAUSES IMMEDIATE PANIC FROM THE DRIVER AS THEY ATTEMPT TO DRIVE SAFELY OUT OF THE TRAFFIC.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS VEHICLE.  THE FIRST TIME, FORD MECHANICS BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON THE RECALLED FUEL PUMP AND REPLACED IT.  SINCE CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT THE REMEDY TO THIS PROBLEM, I BELIEVE THAT MORE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF THE IMMEDIATE LOSS OF POWER THAT MYSELF AND MANY OTHER HAVE EXPERIENCED.   *TR",

I LATER FOUND OUT THAT MY CAR HAD BEEN RECALLED FOR POSSIBLE FIRE DUE TO ENGINE OVERHEATING. I ASSUME THAT THIS MESSAGE IS THE PRE-CURSOR TO WHAT COULD BE A POSSIBLE FIRE. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND I AM AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM FORD ON A POSSIBLE FIX. THE CAR WAS ONLY 1 WEEK OLD. I HAVE REQUESTED FORD TO TAKE THE CAR BACK AND GET INTO A NON-AFFECTED ENGINE TYPE.  *TR",
