THE HITCHES BEING FABRICATED BY THE COMPANY APPEARS NOT TO HAVE STRICT STANDARDS AND CAUSE THE TRAILER TO LEAN AND PREVENTS THE HITCH FROM CENTERING THE MOTORCYCLE.  UNDER WEIGHT, I FELT THAT THE TRAILER CAUSED MY BIKE TO LEAN TO THE RIGHT.  BECAUSE THE TRAILERS ARE NOT CENTERED AND STRAIGHT, THIS COULD AFFECT SAFE OPERATIONS FOR MOTORCYCLIST TOWING THIS TRAILER.  CONTACT WITH THE FACTORY REVEALED THEY WERE AWARE THE HITCHES DID NOT CENTER THE BIKE BUT THE COMPANY FAILS TO PROVIDE A FIX.  DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, I REFUSED TO TOW MY TRAILER UNTIL I COULD GET THE HITCH MODIFIED.  THIS WAS AT MY COST SINCE THE COMPANY REFUSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
