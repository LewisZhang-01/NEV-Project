        "summary": "The largest issue was today, 2/22/2022, when I was driving doing 56 miles per hour it felt like it wouldn't accelerate. Then all of a sudden, the wheel kind of jerked right and the car shifted down all on it's own and I was doing 25 mph. The check engine light came on immediately after the violent jerking happened. I was on a 4 lane highway and had to immediately pull over onto the shoulder. It was jerking forward and back as I was trying to pull over on a freeway where the speed limit is 70 mph!!! I had my 80-year-old mother in the car with me. AND YES!! It put us both at great risk! I had to call a tow truck and they towed it to a dealership 9.8 miles away. When I talked to the Assistant Manager, he said that there were 3 other GMC Yukon 2016 that had come in today - ALL WERE 2016 GMC YUKON MODELS WITH 125K MILES. My GMC has 124,700 MILES all with Transmission problems. This can't be an anomaly. So I got online and there are many, many complaints about this transmission. As a matter of fact, it appears in 2019 there was a Class Action Lawsuit about this very thing. I will not know until tomorrow for sure what the issue is - because the dealership could not get to it today. However, something significant happened. As a side note, recently I had an electrical problem where sensors, etc are all saying need to be serviced and none of them are working.  I had appt today at 10:30 am to have them check this. On the way there, the violent jerking and sudden downshift and check engine light came on. I was scared to death and so I pulled over and called a tow truck. The dealership did not tell me this is a common issue, nor was I aware. The dealership told me if it is in fact the transmission - cost is $6,000!!! I need someone to contact me to discuss this.

We are now having the same issue with our driver light but they are stating that the recall only covered one light with knowledge that both lights are defective. Only one light was replaced. They also had a recall on a defective air compressor that we paid $580 for but because of mileage it was not covered. I spoke with a rep by the name of Angellica in the complaint department that confirmed that the letters regarding the air compressors were sent in November of 2017 and I did not receive that notice during that time. I purchased the vehicle in April of 2017.  If any part of a vehicle is defective, or poorly made coverage should not end and defective parts should be replaced. We are looking to be reimbursed for repairs and coverage provided for the second light on our vehicle. GM refuses to resolve this issue and is placing my family in danger with defective parts on this vehicle. I am looking for this to be resolved as soon as possible. This is poor business and the quality of this vehicle that is 5 years old is poor. Attached you will see the invoice from the dealer states that the wiring is bad but coverage was expired due to mileage. If defective parts are in a vehicle there should not be a limitation on getting them replaced. GM made this mistake and it needs to be corrected.",

GENERALLY, IF A BREAK LIGHT FAILS YOU CAN REPLACE THE BULB FOR AROUND $5 BUT WHEN THESE ASSEMBLIES FAIL IT COSTS THE OWNER AROUND $700 TO REPLACE. DRIVING AROUND WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS IS A  TRAFFIC VIOLATION. A CAR CAN NOT PASS SAFETY INSPECTION WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS SO THE OWNER IS FORCED TO PAY THE MONEY FOR THE REPLACEMENT PART FROM WHICH GMC PROFITS.. WHY IS THIS NOT A SAFETY RECALL?  GMC KNOWS IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT CAN POSSIBLY CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AS A RESULT.WHAT IS THE NHTSA STAND ON THIS?",

IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE EARLY BROKEN LIGHT.  I HAD LESS THAN 36,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  I LEASED THE VEHICLE IN APPROX SEPT 2016 AND THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PAST (LESS THAN 75 DAYS) EXPIRATION OF THE 36 MONTH WARRANTY.  SO, THE DEALER QUOTED ME $950+/- DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HOUSING.  THE DEALER REP EXPLAINED THAT THE ENTIRE HOUSING HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS LED AND DIDN'T USE A BULB.  THE DEALER REP TOLD ME THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.    I WAS INCENSED AND REFUSED TO PAY.  I WENT HOME AND GOOGLED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS PERVASIVE WITH THE 2015-18 YUKON AND OTHER SIMILAR GM PRODUCTS.

OF COURSE MY CAR IS JUST OUT OF WARRANTY SO THEY SAID I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ISSUES.    AGAIN, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL!!! THEY SHOULD BE PAYING FOR IT AND THANKING THERE LUCKY STARS NO ONE WAS INJURED. THE TOTAL CAME TO $950, THEY ASKED IF I WANTED THEM TO FIX THE PUMP, BELT AND BELT KIT (I ASKED IF THIS WAS THE ISSUE OTHERS WERE HAVING AND HE SAID HE BELIEVES SO). WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY NO? DID I REALLY HAVE AN OPTION?? THE BRAKES WEREN'T WORKING!!!! KIND OF A BIG DEAL!!
