Returned same day by service department but failed to repair (see following service report).  \u202211/30/20 \u2013 12/4/20: Five (5) days of service.  Vehicle presented to dealer service department immediately after pick-up from aforementioned service to correct 2nd systemic failure which subsequently occurred promptly after departing the dealership.  Resulting system failure produced highly dangerous operating conditions in which vehicle became immediately and unexpectedly incapacitated while attempting to merge into interstate traffic at accelerating speed.   \u20221/25/21 \u2013 2/5/21: Twelve (12) days of service following 3rd system failure.  As per dealer service reps, an Alfa Romeo service agent stated there was a defect in in the molds used for creating engine / engine blocks in the Giulia and the resulting defects can cause an oil leak while in operation which, based on its location, can result in entire operating system collapsing unexpectedly when said leak occurs.  As documented in the service record, metal shavings were found in the oil and oil pump of vehicle and per the guidance of the Alfa Romeo service agent, dealer replaced the entire engine \u202212/10/21: On 12/10/21, the 4th catastrophic system failure occurred during interstate travel in the rain while attempting to accelerate and pass a slow moving vehicle.  Vehicle became unexpectedly incapacitated causing seriously life-threatening conditions.    Vehicle available for inspection currently.",

I MAY HAVE MISCALCULATED MY MILEAGE, BUT IN ANY EVENT, I RAN OUT OF FUEL (I WAS CLOSE TO A GAS STATION AS WAS ABLE TO GET THE FUEL AND START THE CAR WITHIN 20 MINUTES OVERALL).  THE CAR STOPPED, AND THE IT AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED PARK MODE, PREVENTING IT FROM BEING PUT INTO NEUTRAL AND PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, OR PICKED UP FOR ROAD SERVICE UNLESS THE TOWER HAD A WHEEL DOLLY, TO HANDLE A 4-WHEEL DRIVE CAR.  I THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL SAFETY HAZARD. I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE. THE ONLY SOLUTION I COULD FIND, NOT DOCUMENTED IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL, IS A LEVER ON THE TRANSMISSION, LOCATED UNDER THE CAR, WHICH CAN BE PUSHED UP ONLY WITH A PARTICULAR MACHINE SCREW. OBVIOUSLY THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITH A CAR STUCK ON THE ROAD. I CALLED ZF, THE MAKER OF THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH IS USED IN MILLIONS OF CARS.  ZF ADVISED THAT I WAS CORRECT, AND THAT MANUFACTURERS CAN PUT IN IN-CAR ACCESS TO THE LEVER OR SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, BUT THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH MANUFACTURER.  I CALLED FCA, THE MANUFACTURER, AND THEY INDICATED THAT I HAD TO CALL A DEALER.  I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALER, ALFA ROMEO WHITE PLAINS (NY). THE SERVICE MANAGER, WHO IS AN ALFA ROMEO MASTER MECHANIC, INDICATED THAT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED THIS SITUATION SEVERAL TIMES, AND HAD ASKED FCA TO FIX THIS.  HE HAS RECEIVED NO USEFUL RESPONSE OR SOLUTION.    ALTHOUGH THIS SITUATION MAY BE RARE (IT APPLIES NOT ONLY TO OUT OF FUEL, BUT MANY OTHER SITUATIONS OF  ELECTRICAL OR OTHER FAILURES), IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.  I WAS LUCKY.  I WAS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A LITTLE TRAVELED LOCAL STREET.  WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN ON A HIGHWAY?      PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL TO REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION OR A FIX TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT.",
