I GUESS I AM LUCKY, AS MINE TOOK 6 YEARS TO FAIL AND BE REPLACED BY AN ALUMINUM, NON-CORROSIVE OR RUSTING REPLACEMENT TUBE AT THE COST OF $448.00.

THEY JUST WON'T FACE UP TO THE FACT IT WAS A VERY POOR DESIGN TO USE LOW QUALITY METAL THAT WILL RUST OUT.

I WILL REPLACE MY T&C WITH A HONDA PASSPORT OR HYUNDAI ENTOURAGE OR BUICK ENCLAVE.  WHEN THE LATEST PURCHASER OF CHRYSLER CORP. FINDS OUT HOW MANY CUSTOMERS THEY HAVE LOST DUE TO THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD A FORMER LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE, THEY TOO WILL BE SELLING CHRYSLER JUST LIKE MERCEDES BENZ DID LAST YEAR.  WITH THE GREAT REPUTATION FOR RESPECTING THEIR CUSTOMERS AND LARGE BANK ROLL THAT TOYOTA HAS, OUR \"BIG 3\" COULD BE ALL OWNED BY OFFSHORE FINANCES AND REFERRED TO AS \"THE BIG ONE\".  A WORD FOR PEOPLE CONSIDERING BUYING A USED CHRYSLER PRODUCT MINI VAN, STAY AWAY FROM THOSE WITH REAR HEAT & A/C, AS IT WILL ONLY BE AN ADDED EXPENSE OF 4-600 DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE FOR SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO MEANS TO PREVENT OR PROTECT OR ARE EVEN MADE AWARE OF BY CHRYSLER/CAR DEALERS.  *TR",

RECENTLY I TOOK THE VAN TO MY LOCAL DEALER FOR ITS REGULAR OIL CHANGE AND TO HAVE A TIRE ROTATION AND ALIGNMENT PERFORMED. WHILE PERFORMING THIS SERVICE THE DEALER SERVICE CONSULTANT TOLD ME THAT THE LINES FROM THE FRONT HEATER TO THE REAR HEATER WERE CORRODED TO THE POINT WHERE THE LINES WERE ABOUT TO BREAK AND/OR LEAK COOLANT AND SHOULD BE REPLACED.  THEY SHOWED ME THE AREA AND SURE ENOUGH THE AREA BEHIND THE CROSS MEMBER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FRONT WHEEL HAD THE MOUNTING BRACKET RUSTED OFF COMPLETELY AND THE LINE ITSELF FOR ABOUT 4 INCHES JUST BEHIND THE BEND TO GO UP IN FRONT OF THE FIREWALL HAD METAL FLAKING OFF AND WAS ABOUT TO GIVE WAY. I HAVE MARKED THE AREA ON THE ENCLOSED FIGURE 6 FROM YOUR SERVICE MANUAL. THE CORRODED AREA WAS A FEW INCHES IN FRONT OF THE RUBBER LINE WHICH ACTS AS A CONNECTION FROM THE METAL FRONT HEATER LINE TO THE METAL UNDERBODY LINE TO THE REAR HEATER. FOR YOUR INFORMATION NO COOLANT HAS BEEN ADDED OR CHANGED IN THIS VEHICLE SINCE ITS ORIGINAL DELIVERY WITH THE FACTORY INSTALLED COOLANT.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS LINE SHOULD NOT HAVE CORRODED THIS RAPIDLY (FIVE YEARS AND LOW MILEAGE) AND THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THIS REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THIS IS BAD DESIGN AND MATERIAL SELECTION. IN THIS DAY AND AGE NO LINES OF THIS TYPE SHOULD DETERIORATE THIS RAPIDLY EVEN IN A SECTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE SALT IS USED IN THE WINTER ON THE HIGHWAYS. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPLETE LOSS OF COOLANT AND THE SAFETY HAZARD OF A MAJOR FAILURE. YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A RECALL INSPECTION AND REPLACEMENT IN THOSE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WINTER SALT IS USED.  *JB",

SUDDENLY THERE WAS A METALLIC KIND OF NOISE LIKE A CRUNCHING ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHERE THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM IS LOCATED, THEN THE VEHICLE STARTED TO LOSE POWER. I TURNED THE AIR OFF AND THE NOISE STOPPED. AFTER LEAVING BURGER KING THE AIR WAS TURNED BACK ON, THE SAME NOISE OCCURRED; LATER SMOKE STARTED BILLOWING FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.   THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN TODAY 10/04/05 TO SOUTHEAST AUTOMOTIVE, WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE COMPRESSOR WAS THE PROBLEM. I REFERRED THEM TO THE WARRANTY OF THE VEHICLE (NOT CHRYSLER) WHO INFORMED THEM THAT THERE IS A BULLETIN OUT ON THIS SAME PROBLEM.  THE DEALER CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS. ANYWAY I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER WILL FIX THE PROBLEM.    CURRENTLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THEY ARE SQUEALING  AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS ANOTHER NOISE ON THAT END LIKE STRUTS OR BEARINGS OR SOME OTHER PART IS LOSE. IT OCCURS WHEN I BRAKE OR ACCELERATING AFTER I HAVE STOPPED OR WHEN I TURN THE WHEEL OF THE VEHICLE. I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP TO ALSO CHECK THE BRAKES SINCE THEY HAD JUST FIXED BOTH OF THEM BACK ON 3/14/05. THEY SAID THAT THEY DROVE IT AND DO NOT DETECT ANY NOISES.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ALSO, BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THE BRAKES ARE GOING TO FAIL OR THAT SOME OTHER PART ON THE RIGHT WHEEL OF THE VEHICLE IS GOING TO COME LOOSE AT SOME POINT AND BECOME A DANGER TO MY FAMILY AND I.     A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE ENGINE DIED AND ALL INSTRUMENT PANELS WENT OUT WHILE GOING UP MY DRIVE-WAY.     ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE POWER WINDOW ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING.

IMMIDETLY THE CHECK ENGEIN LIGHT CAME ON AND SHE CALLED ME.  I THEN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT UP.  NOW THE DEALERSHIP IS ABOUT 45 MIN. FROM MY HOUSE.  ON THE WAY UP I LOSE POWER 3 TIMES AND THEN WOULD GET IT TO CATCH.  I MADE IT TO THERE EXIT AND LOST ALL POWER AND CONTROL.  OUR VAN WAS TOWED IN AT OUR EXPENCE AND WE WERE CALLED THE NEXT DAY TO INFORM US THE COULD NOT DUE THE WORK IT HAD TO BE SENT OUT.  WHEN THEY PLACED IT ON THE MACHINE 4 NUMBERS WERE REGERSTERING.  WE THEN HAD TO WAIT FOR A INSPECTOR TO FLY DOWN TO DETERMIN IF THE PROBLEM WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS AND THAT THE TRANSFER PUMP AND CASE WERE THE PROBLEM AND A NEW TRANSSMISSION INSTALLED.  WE HAD TO PAY $249.00 BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  WE RECEIVED OUR VECHICLE ON THURSDAY AND ON FRIDAY IT WAS TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE ANY TIME YOU EXCERATED IT WOULD SHAKE THE VAN.  WE WERE THEN TOLD WE COULD HAVE A RENTAL AT THERE EXPENCE THIS WAS A HASSEL IN ITS SELF WASTING THE WHOLE DAY WITH GETTING ONE.  WE RECEVED A CALL MONDAY SAYING THEY COULDN'T GET THE PROBLEM TO DUBLICATE.  AND WAS ONCE AGAIN RETURNED TO US ON TUESDAY.  TODAY IS WEDNESSDAY AND WE ARE CURRENTLY FIGHTING WITH THE DEALERSHIP DUE TO THE FACT THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE.  I AM AT MY WITS END.
