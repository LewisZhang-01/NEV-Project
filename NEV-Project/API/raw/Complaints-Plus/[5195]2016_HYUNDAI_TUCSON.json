        "summary": "Multiple door latches failing all within the past 6 months, UNABLE to open from inside or outside. Rear doors both failed within weeks of each other. Front driver's side door is now beginning to stick, which is how the other failing doors began to initially fail. If you Google this issue, you will see it is a common problem for 2016 Hyundai Tucson model. This is a critical issue as all door latch assemblies are failing at the same time on my vehicle, which will make it nearly inoperable, as well as a safety issue if I or my 3 children are unable to enter or exit the vehicle. I took the vehicle to a local ASE certified repair shop and they stated that the cables inside the latch assembly become stretched or compromised. They were able to perform a temporary fix, but they said in order to completely fix the issue, the entire latch assembly needs replaced. The temporary fix did not even last for 3 days and cost me $300. Cost for the assembly part alone for one door is approximately $200. If you add that to labor, I will be spending nearly $1,600 to replace all 4 door latch assemblies. This should not be the consumer's responsibility as it is an ongoing issue for this make and model year. I have submitted a complaint for recall directly to Hyundai US, but this is a critical issue, and something needs to be done immediately!",

Barely a week later, the oil light came on again.  I had some guys at work check it and they said I barely had any oil.  I scheduled another appointment but never made it.  I was driving on the highway when my car starting shaking uncontrollably and dropped down to barely 20mph.  I almost created a pileup as cars behind me were swerving out of the way.  I was almost hit multiple times and could barely get my car over to the breakdown lane.  My check engine light also came on as my speed dropped.  I had it towed to a nearby independent garage where the mechanic told me the diagnostic codes showed that I had misfired cylinders.  He suggested I bring it to a Hyundai dealership to submit a claim as he knew that those type of engines were having issues.  I had it towed again to the nearest Hyundai dealership, where they confirmed that 2 of the cylinders had failed.  Hyundai confirmed with me that they had every record of me coming in to the dealership to get any required maintenance done on the car, yet the engine dies when it barely goes over 100,000 miles.  And to top it off, when I asked for an estimate for repair, they quoted me $17,000 to fix it!",

They checked all of the fluid levels and electrical connections, the battery, all of that was normal but we didn't have the $500+ they wanted to take the engine apart, so that did not get checked. This car had less than 100,000 miles on it and was in great shape. We had it for less than a year and did not even drive it every day. There were no warning lights or messages or anything to let me know that there was a problem. The engine starting making that clunking noise about five minutes before it died. I was on the highway and got off the nearest exit to check for problems but the car stopped moving before I could get someplace safe to take a look.

An independent mechanic who towed it to their shop said there was no oil in the engine. This is impossible because I had plenty of time left before the next oil change. A week prior to this incident we took the car to the Hyundai dealership to fix a recall problem. There was no indication anything was wrong with the engine or car at the time they fixed the recall issue.   Somehow the oil in the engine disappeared and there was no indication from any low oil lights, engine lights, or any other notification that there was an issue.   It currently has been towed to the Hyundai dealership and awaiting their diagnostic and solution. A claim has been opened with Hyundai corporate since there is a recall opened for 2016 Hyundai Tuscons.",

I also have had to bring my car in for oil changes at 2000 miles instead of 3000, because it started eating through oil fast.  The morning of my last oil change, 8/17, my engine started making loud clunking noise.  After the oil change, on the way home to call my dealer, Key Hyundai of Milford, my engine shut off while in Drive on a busy street and started smoking.  Luckily, I was able to move to the small shoulder and put my hazards on and force the car into park to wait for a tow.   If I was not at a safe place to force my car into park the day it died, I could have been seriously injured.  No engine lights or any warning lights went on on the dash at all.  I had it towed to my auto shop and they said it was leaking oil all over the place, not anywhere an oil changer could access, and could not get it started.  They suggested it was a faulty engine and to call Hyundai Corporate, start a case and get it fixed because at just over 100,000 miles it was still considered a young car.  I bought this car at 82,000 miles used and was given no warranty on the engine.  Hyundai Corporate would only open a case if I had it towed to a Hyundai dealer, and had to fight to get them to tow it themselves to Meriden Hyundai, where it currently sits.  This engine failure and the problems leading up to it match exactly that of the large class action suit that is currently going on with Hyundai/Nissan/Kia motors, yet my VIN doesn't match any recalls.  Back in March, I had a check engine light that lead to me paying out of pocket for a misfiring cylinder and having to replace the ignition coil and all my spark plugs.  I have only had this car since October 2019, and have kept it well maintained.   I have been going back and forth with Hyundai Customer Care, and they are sending me in circles and refusing to fix the problem or even attempt to help me solve it.",

When I idled too long the car would just die, I'd have to shift into park actually turn the car off and let it sit 1-3 mins turn it back on and all the lights would be off and it would drive like it did before it died, loud. They did testing on it and said these repairs (crankshaft sensor, spark plugs and I think an oil  change) should fix it. This was less than a month after my previous oil change. Got the car back 3-4 days later and it sounded better but I still felt like it didn't drive and smooth as it should. 2-3 weeks goes by and my oil light again comes on only with sharp turns. The car over the next couple of days would do the loud cranking noise, didn't drive well over 60 and the engine light came on and gauges would go down but would be fine again once the car was turned off for a couple min like 5 . I set up an appt to hVe them look it over again because of the lights coming back on. Not even 2 days later twice going to and from work it completely died out on me (like the first time) but this time it would turn over once it was out in park and turned off correctly. First time I was in the middle of traffic at a red light waited 10 mins multiple times trying to turn the car on to move to the side and it wouldn't. I let it sit for 5 mins without trying to turn it on and it started the gauges didn't work and it was VERY loud stuck in like first gear wouldn't go above 20 mph. Pulled into a neighborhood turned it off to let it cool off again thinking it was over heating. It would crank but again lights still all on and the gear gauge didn't work (down at 0 liek the car was off). I waiting like 20 mins it still had the lights on but the gauges worked, when I tried to drive home it wouldn't go about 45mph or out of 2nd gear.",

They actually bypassed it and so I thought maybe they fixed the issue since the light isn't present anymore.  However the engine light came and the problem developed into a transmission failure. Upon pressing the gas pedal, the vehicle wouldn't run over 30 miles per hour and could only go up to 4 rpms..  I took the car to the mechanic and he replaced the transmission and he said that the root cause was a result of a burnt gasket. So we had that replace also..  After spending $5000 in repairs, the motor or the engine completely overheated and now the car is just a potato.  Another issue is the doors on my car and not opening anymore. I have to manually ply them open by pulling on some mechanical wiring inside the door. Why do I have to pay for bad engineering? This is an obvious risk.",

I said he did and we were trying to figure out if it was the vehicle in front of us because I didn't have any warning lights on my dash indicating any kind of issue. The Jeep in front of us pulled away and we immediately could tell it was my vehicle. When accelerating through the intersection the vehicle was very slow to pick up speed and the knocking sound got louder and more frequent. As we were pulling into our driveway the car again had issues picking up speed, we live up a steep hill and I was worried we weren't going to make it. The oil light came on for a split second and went back off. I was not at my mileage for an oil change but my boyfriend said he was going to check it. He pulled the dipstick out and it was completely dry. He put two and a half quarts of oil in and it barely showed on the dipstick. He put another two quarts in and we let it sit. We turned it back on hoping it wouldn't make the knocking noise but it did. We took it to my mechanic who does my oil changes and he inspected the vehicle and took photos to show that there was no oil leak so he could only conclude that the engine was burning the oil for some reason. We took the car to a Hyundai dealer where they informed me that the engine was ruined and it would need to be completely replaced. They told me that it could be covered under the warranty and they would turn it in. After a week of hearing nothing, Hyundai offered to pay for 50% of the repair costs. I think this is absolutely ridiculous since there was no indication letting me know that my vehicle needed oil and it is clearly a problem with their engine that caused it to burn up all the oil when I was faithful about my oil changes. My mechanic printed all of the records of oil changes being completed on time and now they expect me to pay for this.",

I would have issues with my car turning off then it would leave me in stuck and wouldn't excelerate and almost killed me multiple times so I had it in the shop for the third time.  Finally, it was soo bad that they put a new transmission in under my almost expired 5 year warranty.  My car has been doing better since the new transmission so that is good so far, but wanted to tell you since other ppl are struggling with this as well and should be a recall and we should not have to pay for it at all.   Second complaint is that my car is NOW experiencing door lock issues which makes it a huge safety issue as well.  It unlocks the actual button inside but the handle takes multiple pulls to open from the outside.  So I had to crawl over to push the door open to get in the passenger side, sometimes it will NOT open at all which is very scary.  It all sounds like these make and models are the pits when I google issues.  So I am hoping to add this to a safety recall which it definitely should fall under one.

In an emergency situation where a door needs to be opened from the exterior even when the doors are unlocked, an emergency responder would not be able to access the vehicle. Additionally, if the vehicle had an emergency situation where the occupants of the vehicle needed to disembark the vehicle, the vehicle doors do not open even though child locks are no engaged. This is a very serious and high risk of concern and issue and must be brought forward for review and resolved as soon as possible. Bringing this vehicle to the dealership for repairs does not always guarantee proper repair. If the actuators are at fault and that is being replaced with the same Original Equipment Manufacture parts, this is going to be an ongoing issue possibly deadly.",

Because of that problem engine get heat really quick and their is maximum possibility for fire (due to heat), fire may cause lack of engine oil.   Power (pick up) of car is really low, it is really slow when stop and go on the road, either FREEWAY or on the Street way. If a car could not pick up or drive forward as normal standard their is great possibility for accident, in freeway more possible and street way as well.   I made web based research about these problems, most of the 2016 Hyundai Tucson facing this problem, means this is not my personal problem but THERE IS PROBLEM ALL OF HYUNDAI TUSCON of THIS MODEL. So, Hyundai must solve this problem. Because they know car was defective while they sold us, but defect broke out after long time. There are several 2016 Hyundai Tucson facing typically same problem. This fact proved that car was defective while they sold it to their customers.   Most of the time I change oil and do servicing at Hyundai Dealer, but they never tell me about this problem. But When I realized it my warranty was expired.   I went to inspect my vehicle with Hyundai Dealer but they want to charge to cure this problem, but, if their is manufacturing defect they have to take care free of cost. Because while they sale the car they did not revealed this problem it is misrepresentation. Police, Insurance Representatives or other did not inspected my vehicle.   Their were not any warning lamps message or other symptoms of the problem until now, but when we drive we can feel it.   Please do the web based short research to confirm my issues, and help us to solve this problem.   In addition, they did not notice me about 2020 break recall, I know this form this web site today.",

THE SECOND DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR FAILED TODAY (FEB 5, 2021). THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AS THE DOORS CANNOT BE OPENED FROM EITHER THE INSIDE OR OUT BECAUSE THEY FAIL IN THE \"LOCKED\" POSITION. IF THERE WERE A FIRE OR OTHER ACCIDENT, THE OCCUPANTS WOULD BE TRAPPED INSIDE, RESULTING IN A FATALITY. THE LATCH MECHANISM WON'T UNLOCK FROM EITHER THE PHYSICAL MECHANICAL TOGGLE OR REMOTE SIGNAL. THIS OCCURS THEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY.   THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN DISCUSSED ON NUMEROUS ONLINE HYUNDAI FORUMS. WE ARE ALL WONDERING WHY 1) HYUNDAI HAS NOT ISSUED A SAFETY RECALL 2) WHY THE NHTSA HAS NOT STEPPED IN AND REQUIRED HYUNDAI TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL. NOT BEING ABLE TO EXIT OR ENTER A CAR DURING AN EMERGENCY IS A HUGE RISK TO ALL, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY, AND HANDICAPPED PERSONS.

RIGHT BEFORE I LOST ALL POWER, THE OIL LIGHT FLASHED BRIEFLY AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND AGAIN HEARD A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE BUT WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AS SOON AS I SLOWED AND STOPPED IT DIED AGAIN. I ENDED UP GETTING TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER. THE NEXT DAY I CALLED AND THEY LET ME KNOW I HAD \"THROWN A ROD AND HAD BEARING DAMAGE\". THEY SAID I NEED A NEW ENGINE AND QUOTED ME $12,800. I HAVE PROVIDED ALL SERVICE RECORDS TO THEM WHICH PROVE THAT I HAVE MAINTAINED THE VEHICLE WITH OIL CHANGES AND MAJOR SERVICES DONE AT HYUNDAI AS WELL AS VALVOLINE. THEIR INITIAL OFFER TO ME WAS THEY WOULD COVER 50% OF THE REPAIR. MY SERVICE ADVISOR COUNTERED THEM WITH 90% AND THEIR FINAL OFFER WAS TO COVER 60% AND NO RENTAL - EVEN BEING 7 HOURS FROM HOME.     BEFORE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPEN MY REAR PASSENGER DOOR  IN MONTHS DUE TO NEEDING A NEW ACTUATOR.  I ALSO LET THEM KNOW THAT I BELIEVED THERE WAS ELECTRICAL ISSUES BECAUSE MY TAIL LIGHT WAS ALWAYS GOING OUT EVEN AFTER BEING REPLACED. I WAS DISMISSED AND TOLD THAT I HAD A FAULTY BULB. SAME DAY AFTER GETTING REPLACED, I WAS AGAIN GETTING THAT \"CHECK BRAKE LIGHT\" MESSAGE. I BELIEVE THERE IS A RECALL THAT I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR FOR THIS ISSUE.     AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND ENGINE FAILURE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH HYUNDAI WITH MANY PEOPLE ON THEIR 2ND AND 3RD ENGINES, INCLUDING 2 PEOPLE IN MY OWN FAMILY.

OUR 2016 HYUNDAI TUCSON REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE AND THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR WILL ONLY OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.

SAVE SOMEONE IN THE BACKSEAT DURING AN EMERGENCY- SPECIFICALLY CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR ELDERLY WHO REQUIRE ASSISTANCE.

THIS ISSUE PUTS DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS IN IMMINENT DANGER, NOT TO MENTION THE  STRESS, FRUSTRATION AND FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN YOUR CAR DOOR TO REMOVE A  CHILD FROM A CAR SEAT OR LOVED ONE INTO THEIR WHEEL CHAIR.

THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE LOSS OF PROPULSION THAT I DESCRIBED.  NO REPAIR PRESCRIBED BY THE TSB WAS PERFORMED.",

THE CAR KEPT ACTING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO STALL AT EVERY STOP, IT KEPT STUTTERING, AND WHEN YOU ARE ACCELERATING AND TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE PEDAL THE RPMS KEEP RISING, AND DOESN'T SWITCH GEARS. IT REFS AND RPM GOES UP BUT IT DOESN'T SWITCH GEARS UP OR DOWN SHIFT EITHER. THE ENGINE REVS HIGH AND WON'T SWITCH GEARS. IT'S LIKE IT WANTS TO ACCELERATE WHEN YOU WANT IT TO SLOW DOWN AND WHEN STOPPED IT WANTS TO STALL. TODAY IT HAPPENED. WE CAME TO A STOP SO WE COULD TURN LEFT ONTO AN ONRAMP ON HIGHWAY, (HAVE TO CROSS OVER OTHER LANE TO GO ON ON RAMP), AND IT STUTTERED AND STALLED ON OPPOSITE ONCOMING TRAFFIC SIDE, BEFORE WE COULD REACH THE RAMP. MY SON WAS DRIVING AND I WAS IN FRONT SEAT AND DAUGHTER WAS IN BACK SEAT, I GOT SCARED, AS YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT COMING OVER THE HILL ON SIDE WE STALLED (ONCOMING TRAFFIC). THE GUY SAW WE HAD STALLED AND RAN OUT AND STARTED WAVING SOMETHING DOWN. IT WAS AN ONCOMING SEMI. THANKFULLY HE WAS ABLE TO REDIRECT HIM OR WE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK. WE GOT THE CAR STARTED AGAIN AND WERE ABLE TO GET HOME. I LOOKED UP WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A MASS RECALL OF MY EXACT CAR MODEL, IN THE EXACT TIME FRAME OF VEHICLE BEING MADE. THE RECALL WAS FOR THE EXACT THINGS THAT ARE AND DID HAPPEN TO US. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM WHY THEY NEVER DIVULGED THIS INFORMATION AND THEY SAID THE DIDN'T KNOW. I READ ON THE NHTSA SITE THAT MY EXACT SUV, MADE THE SAME DATE, HYUNDAI HAD RECALLED, BUT MINE FOR SOME REASON IS NOT. PROBLEM IS WHEN I PUT MY VIN IN, NOTHING COMES UP FOR A RECALL. I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY KIDS BACK IN THIS CAR. I JUST DROPPED $24,000 5 DAYS AGO IN A CAR LOAN. PLEASE HELP.",

I REPORTED THIS TO THE DEALER SERVICE AND THEY AGAIN CHECKED AND SAID THE VEHICLE HAS THE LATEST TCM UPDATE.

IT ALWAYS WOULD COME DOWN TO THAT IT WAS THE WAY WE WERE DRIVING IT. I'M SORRY BUT A TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT RESPOND IN THAT MATTER.  I ALSO WAS TOLD BY A HYUNDAI REP.

I HAVE BEEN STUCK AT INTERSECTIONS WITH NO ACCELERATION, THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE WHEN MERGING ONTO FREEWAYS IS LIMITED (ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THE CAR TO SHIFT TO A LOWER GEAR), AND SHIFTING OUT OF 1ST GEAR AT LOW SPEEDS/LOCAL TRAFFIC IS HIGHLY SPORADIC (SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE THE 'CLUTCH' IS HALF ENGAGED; OTHER TIMES IT WON'T SHIFT OUT OF FIRST, SO YOU ACCELERATE FASTER THAN YOU WANT AND AT MUCH HIGHER RPM THAN WOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL DRIVING).  HYUNDAI HAS JUST RESET THE SOFTWARE IN MY CAR SO THAT IT CAN 'LEARN' AGAIN, BUT THE UPDATE PROVIDED WITH THE RECALL DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE SOMETHING TO BE DONE AS NEW CAR OWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO UPDATE SOFTWARE MULTIPLE TIMES PER YEAR IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLE OPERATE SAFELY.",

AFTERWARDS, IN JANUARY 2017, WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY, THE VEHICLE DROPPED INTO NEUTRAL BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND GEAR.  THE RPMS REVVED UP TO 4, BUT THE VEHICLE HAD A SUDDEN LOSS OF FORWARD MOMENTUM.  BECAUSE I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, THIS PRESENTED A SAFETY HAZARD TO ME.  THE DEALERSHIP RE-PERFORMED THE DECEMBER 2016 UPDATE THE FIRST PART OF FEBRUARY 2017 AND CAUSED A FULL SYSTEM FAILURE REQUIRING MANUAL REPROGRAMMING.  IT THEN RELEASED THE VEHICLE BACK TO ME.  AFTER TWO DAYS, THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY.  I WAS AGAIN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND AFRAID ABOUT BEING REAR-ENDED.  WHEN THE CAR REENGAGED AFTER THESE FAILURES, IT THEN SURGED FORWARD.  THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND THEREFORE UNPREDICTABLE AND UNSAFE.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME IT HAS NOT BEEN UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THUS HAS NOTHING TO FIX.  ADDITIONALLY, IT HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH HYUNDAI CORPORATE WHOSE POSITION IS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED WITH THE DECEMBER 2016 UPDATE.  AND, SINCE THE DEALER HASN'T DUPLICATED IT, THEY HAVE NO FURTHER OBLIGATION TO ME.

THE LAST OCCASION, NOVEMBER 7, 2016, I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE NEAR THE FAST LANE ON THE GLENDALE FREEWAY AT ABOUT 9:30 AM.   THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LOST POWER AND, SINCE THERE IS NO LEFT HAND SHOULDER, I HAD TO COAST ACROSS SEVERAL LANES OF FAST MOVING TRAFFIC TO TRY TO REACH AN EXIT RAMP.   AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE VEHICLE, I GAVE THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER A NUDGE TO THE RIGHT.  I HEARD A SLIGHT MECHANICAL SOUND AND THE TRANSMISSION RE-ENGAGED AND I REGAINED FULL POWER.    THE VEHICLE HAD NEARLY A FULL TANK OF FUEL AT THE TIME.  THIS SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME IN THE APRIL/MAY TIME FRAME WHEN DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY (ABOUT 1/2 TANK OF FUEL) AND THEN AGAIN IN EARLY JULY, 2016. WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY NEAR GRIFFITH PARK (NOT SURE OF THE FUEL THIS TIME).   BOTH TIMES, WITHOUT WARNING, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LOST POWER.    IT COASTED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS BUT THESE TWO TIMES -- AFTER LESS THAN A MINUTE -- THE POWER REENGAGED, OR SELF CORRECTED, ON ITS OWN.  THE NOVEMBER 7TH INCIDENT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND THE ENGINE DID NOT SELF CORRECT.  ON NOVEMBER 8TH, I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO KEYES HYUNDAI IN VAN NUYS.  SINCE IT HAD BEEN OVER 4 MONTHS AND SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES SINCE THE SECOND INCIDENT, I WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE, HOWEVER, AND, SINCE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT THE DEFECT,  HAVE ASKED HYUNDAI TO CANCEL THE LEASE ON THE VEHICLE RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO RISK MYSELF AND MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE.",

IN RANDOM OCCASIONS, ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP RESULTS IN THE VEHICLE RPMS INCREASING WITH NO MOVEMENT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP APPLIED A SOFTWARE FIX FOR THE DTC BASED ON A SAFETY RECALL WHICH RESOLVED THE 'FALSE NEUTRAL' ISSUE.  HOWEVER, UNPREDICTABLE HESITATION AND SHUDDERING STILL PERSIST AT 3,000 MILES.  VEHICLE ACCELERATION BEHAVES UNRELIABLY AND CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS INDICATIVE OF A 16 YEAR OLD LEARNING TO DRIVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION FOR THE FIRST TIME.  SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE ACCELERATES SMOOTHLY WITH NO ISSUE.  OTHER TIMES THE VEHICLE HESITATES AND SHUDDERS AS IF THE VEHICLE WERE ATTEMPTING TO START IN 2ND GEAR WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND THE VEHICLE WANTS TO STALL, AND THEN SLOWLY ACCELERATES.  STILL OTHER TIMES THE VEHICLE HESITATES WITH NO MOVEMENT WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS DEPRESSED AND THEN JUMPS FORWARD AS IF 'POPPING THE CLUTCH' AND THEN ACCELERATES VERY AGGRESSIVELY.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY (SEPT 22, 2016) AND THEY WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE BEHAVIOR AND INFORMED ME THAT IS THE 'NORMAL OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF A DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION.'  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS TRANSMISSION IS THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE WHEN NEEDING TO PULL OUT IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC.  AT ALL TIMES YOU MUST GIVE YOURSELF A MINIMUM OF 2 SECONDS DISTANCE BEFORE PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW IF THE TRANSMISSION WILL RELIABLY ENGAGE AND THE VEHICLE WILL PREDICTABLY ACCELERATE.  I SHOULD NOTE THAT ONCE THE VEHICLE IS PAST 10-15 MPH, IT ACCELERATES AND PERFORMS RELIABLY AND THE TRANSMISSION IS RESPONSIVE.",

I HAVE ALREADY HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT. 1ST) TRYING TO BACK OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY, WOULD NOT GO. 2ND) LEAVING A PARKING SPACE IT WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. 3RD) DRIVING IN A PARKING GARAGE UPHILL AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING AND COULDN'T GO UP THE RAMP PROPERLY. I TRIED TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE AUTOMAX DEALERSHIP IN NORMAN, OK AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE IT BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEY KNOWINGLY SOLD ME AND UNSAFE AND DEFECTIVE VEHICLE!!! I HAVEN'T EVEN USED A HALF TANK OF GAS. I DID TELL THEM TO STOP THE PAPERWORK ON IT AND NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH HYUNDAI HEADQUARTERS.

ON 7/8/16, I DROPPED MY CAR OFF AT CHAPMAN HYUNDAI WHERE IT SAT FOR 34 DAYS BEING DESTROYED BY THE ELEMENTS OF THE ARIZONA SUN, BEFORE HYUNDAI AMERICA FINALLY RELEASED A SOFTWARE UPDATE.  BACK IN MAY, I HAD REQUESTED HYUNDAI REPURCHASE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE, WHICH OF COURSE WAS DECLINED.  AFTER REQUESTING AN ENGINEER TO PERSONALLY LOOK AT MY VEHICLE, I WAS INFORMED (07/08/16) THAT HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND IS WORKING ON A SOFTWARE UPDATE WITH NO ETA.  FINALLY AFTER MY CAR WAS THERE FOR 34 DAYS, THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE UPDATE HAS BEEN PERFORMED AND MY CAR IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED.  THIS INFORMATION COMES A FEW DAYS TOO LATE AS ANYTHING PASS THE 30 DAYS IS CONSIDERED LEMON LAW IN ARIZONA.  SINCE THE DAY WE DROPPED OFF THE CAR, WE HAVE INSISTED THAT THEY REPURCHASE THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE.  ON THE 11TH OF AUGUST, WE WERE INFORMED THAT ARE REQUEST FOR 'REPURCHASE' HAS BEEN APPROVED.  ON THE 13TH , I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE AND NOW IT SITS IN MY GARAGE WAITING FOR THE 'REPURCHASE' TO COMPLETE.  DON'T LET HYUNDAI GET AWAY WITH THIS, HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE AND DEMAND THEY REPURCHASE YOUR CAR.  THE ISSUE IS SAFETY AND THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE IT'S ALL FIXED WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE?  WHAT ABOUT 34 DAYS MY CAR WAS BEING DESTROYED BY THE SUN / ELEMENTS?  WHAT ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO OUR CARS BY THE CLUTCH 'SLIPPING' OR 'NEUTRALLING' OUT?

WHEN I MADE THE INITIAL APPT THE RECEPTIONISTS STATED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL VEHICLES IN FOR THIS ISSUE. THE INITIAL TIME AT THE DEALER, THEY COMPLETED THE LATCH RECALL AND RESET THE COMPUTER TO RELEARN THE SYSTEM, HOPING THAT WOULD BE THE SAVING GRACE. DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD WHILE DRIVING, THAT I PULLED OVER AND THE SOUND DIED DOWN AT BIT. MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO TAKE IN THE VEHICLE THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO RECREATE THE ISSUE AND THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK TO GO BACK AND FORTH TO THE DEALER TO HEAR THAT NOTHING IS WRONG. THE DEALER ACTS LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE CONCERN.

WHEN I CALLED THE HYUNDAI SERVICE AGENT I WAS TOLD TO ONLY USE THE AIR CONDITIONER ON THE LOWEST FAN.  IF I PUT IT ON A HIGHER SETTING IT WILL FREEZE UP AND BLOW ONLY HOT AIR. IT WAS 95 OUT SIDE.    LATER I CAME TO A STOP AND WHEN I STEPPED ON THE GAS THE ENGINE REVVED UP BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. I LET OFF ON THE GAS AND TRIED AGAIN. THE ENGINE AGAIN REVVED UP FOR  ABOUT 6 SECONDS THEN THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD. THE NEXT DAY  I HAD PARKED ON A SMALL INCLINE. WHEN I WENT TO LEAVE I: PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE - RELEASED THE PARKING BRAKE - PUT IT INTO DRIVE AND STEPPED ON THE GAS.  THE ENGINE REVVED UP BUT DID NOT GO FORWARD, INSTEAD IT ROLLED BACKWARDS ABOUT 6 TO 12 INCHES THEN IT POPPED INTO GEAR AND LURCHED FORWARD. EVERY TIME I DROVE THE CAR I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT HYUNDAI TUCSON.  I FELT UNSAFE AND WAS WORRIED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ACCIDENT WITH THE CAR ACTING LIKE IT DID.  TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I LOOKED ON LINE AND FOUND HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS OF THIS VEHICLE ALL STATING THE SAME PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING.      SO, I TRADED IN MY 6 DAY OLD TUCSON FOR A SANTA FE -  AND I AM VERY HAPPY NOW.  THE TUCSON I FELT WAS THE MOST UNSAFE AND UNRELIABLE VEHICLE THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED OR DRIVEN. NO ONE AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME ABOUT THESE KNOWN PROBLEMS AND/OR ISSUES WITH THE DUEL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.

THE ENGINE RPM'S INCREASED BUT NO FORWARD MOVEMENT. STARTED TO ROLL BACKWARDS ALMOST HITTING THE CAR BEHIND ME. HAD TO SHIFT TO PARK AND THEN BACK TO DRIVE TO MOVE FORWARD. MID-JUNE STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN, HIT THE GAS, THE CAR SAT STILL. THE RPM'S INCREASED BUT NO FORWARD MOVEMENT. MY WIFE HAD TO PLACE IN PARK AND BACK INTO DRIVE BEFORE SHE COULD MOVE FORWARD CAUSING HER TO SIT THROUGH THE ENTIRE CYCLE ON THE LIGHT. LATE JUNE ENTERING MEG AUTO SPA (CAR WASH), STOPPED TO ENTER THE WASHING TUNNEL AND COULD NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL SHIFTED THE CAR TO PARK AND THE BACK TO DRIVE.  SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 06/27/2016. TOLD THAT LAG IN SHIFTING WAS NORMAL FOR THIS VEHICLE. ASKED THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VEHICLE ANYWAY. DAY 1 WAS CONTACTED BY DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ISSUE BUT WANTED TO KEEP THE CAR FOR A WEEK TO TEST. AT THE END OF EACH DAY THEY CONTACTED US TO KEEP US INFORMED AS THE STATUS OF THE TESTING. ON FRIDAY, JULY 1ST, I WAS INFORMED THEY WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE AND THEY WILL SEND THE DATA TO HYUNDAI ENGINEERS TO BE STUDIED.

THIS HAPPENED 5/30/16 AT APPX. 2800 MILES 3 WEEKS LATER WITH THEM UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND 3100 MILES, I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER HE PROCEEDS TO EXPLAIN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR CAR ACCORDING TO HYUNDAI IT IS ACTING AS IT WAS DESIGNED AND HYUNDAI NEEDS TO INFORM THE OWNERS THEY MUST DRIVE THIS CAR LIKE A STANDARD (HUH).  IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC YOU CANNOT EDGE THE CAR FORWARD  THIS IS ALLOWING THE CLUTCHES TO SLIP AND OVERHEAT BUT INSTEAD YOU MUST LEAVE A 1  TO 2 CAR LENGTH GAP THEN GET THE CAR UP TO 3MPH AND STOP AGAIN IF NEEDED .  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE IN MY OPINION IT IS PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH EVERY STOP ANY DRIVER MAKES IN THIS CAR.",

AFTER SEVERAL ROUND TRIPS UP TO 4,000 RPM AND BACK, THE CAR EVENTUALLY GOT IN GEAR.  I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHICH, IF ANY OF MY ACTIONS, CORRECTED THE ISSUE.   RESEARCHING ONLINE, I SEE THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT HYUNDAI HASN'T PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS OR ISSUED A RECALL.   AN ONLINE TUCSON FORUM ENTITLED \"DANGEROUS HORRIBLE DCT\" HAS OVER 40,000 VIEWS AND SEVERAL HUNDRED POSTS REGARDING THIS MATTER. (HTTP://WWW.HYUNDAI-FORUMS.COM/2016-TUCSON-IX35-MODELS/454074-DANGEROUS-HORRIBLE-DCT.HTML).  FORUM POSTS NOTE THAT DEALERS ARE PLAYING DUMB ON THIS ONE UNLESS THEY CAN RECREATE THE ISSUE 1ST-HAND.  A YOUTUBE VIDEO (HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=TCVTR_ZCYRS) PROVIDES AMPLE EVIDENCE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH MY EXPERIENCE (AND THAT OF MANY OTHERS IT WOULD SEEM.  THIS SITUATION IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!!   I SINCERELY HOPE THE NHTSA LOOKS INTO THIS MATTER IMMEDIATELY.  *TR",

HESITATION FROM A DEAD STOP, ONCE AT A DEAD STOP AND YOU SLOWLY TAKE FOOT OFF BREAK THE RPM'S DROP AND THE CAR SHUTTERS AND FEELS LIKE ITS GOING TO DIE! DEALER SAID ITS NORMAL FOR A DUAL CLUTCH BECAUSE ITS LIKE A MANUAL AND THAT I NEED TO DRIVE 2 FOOTED OR DEAL WITH IT.  I ALSO HAD IT TO DEALER SAY PRIOR TO THIS TIME,  IT'S BECAUSE THE DUAL TRANSMISSION IS STAYING IN SECOND GEAR AND THAT'S NORMAL AND THAT'S WHY IT FEELS LIKE ITS GOING TO DIE. TRANSMISSION NEVER SHIFTS THE SAME.. WHEN IN ECO IT WORSE AND WHEN IN SPORT MODE IT VERY JERKY AND THE SHIFTING IS AWFUL AND NEVER SMOOTH. BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.. FEELS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION HAS NO IDEA WHEN TO SHIFT AND OR HOW TO SHIFT. THE RPM'S GO UP BUT THE CAR DOESN'T SEEM TO PICK UP SPEED  LIKE IT SHOULD AS FAR WHERE THE RPM'S ARE AT, ALWAYS REVS UP BEFORE IT WILL EVEN MORE.  ALSO WHEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IT TAKES A LOT TO KICK IT DOWN TO PICK UP SPEED WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.   THE VIBRATION AT HIGHER SPEEDS IS HORRIBLE . HAD TIRES ROTATED AND BALANCED 2 TIMES ALREADY AND IT TILL HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM. DEALERSHIP DOESN'T SEEM TO FIND T TO BE THAT BIG OF A DEAL. HWY SPEEDS THE CABIN SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE ONE WINDOW OPEN AND YOU GET THAT SOUND OF BEING IN A TUNNEL.   SINCE DAY 1 WHEN PUTTING CAR IN REVERSE AND THEN TO DRIVE, THERE IS A CLUNKING POPPING SOUND FROM THE BACK OF CAR AFTER IT HITS ABOUT 20 MPH. HAD THAT LOOKED AT 3 TIMES AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. IT IS MUCH LOUDER AND MORE OFTEN NOW WITH MORE MILES  DEAL SAYS ALL MY PROBLEMS ARE NORMAL AND NOTHING THEY CAN DO BUT TO DEAL WITH IT. WORST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!!! HAD IN SHOP 6 TIMES ALREADY IN 9 MONTHS AND HYUNDAI WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP .   *TR",

THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT PROPELLED ME FORWARD VERY FAST.  I HAD A SEMI RIGHT BEHIND ME, AND I COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE UNTIL IT FINALLY KICKED IN.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT IF THAT TRUCK WOULD HAVE HIT ME. THE VEHICLE HAD 4703 MILES ON IT.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON A BUSY STREET ON MARCH 20, 2016.  I HAD STOPPED AT A LIGHT, AND WHEN I WENT FORWARD, IT GOT UP TO 18 MPH AND THEN JUST NOTHING, NO MOVEMENT AT ALL.  THE TACH SAID THE ENGINE WAS REVVING, BUT I WAS GOING NOWHERE.  THIS HAPPENED AT THE NEXT 7 TRAFFIC LIGHTS/STOP SIGNS AND EACH TIME WAS THE SAME THING, 18 MPH STOPPING, AND PROPELLING ME AT 33 MPH.  THIS WAS EACH AND EVERY TIME. THE MILEAGE WAS 6695 AT THE TIME. THERE IS A SERIOUS LAG TIME IN THE 1.6 LITER ENGINE, THAT HYUNDAI HAS BEEN MADE AWARE OF.  I CONTACTED THEM BOTH TIMES, AND THE CASE # IS 8735263. THEY BASICALLY JUST TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG AS IT DIDN'T REGISTER ON THE COMPUTER EITHER TIME.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT HAS HAPPENED TO MANY, MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE US.  I'M TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS CAR NOW AS I FEAR THAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, I COULD BE KILLED, OR SOMEONE ELSE COULD BE HURT/  KILLED.  THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW IN SEPT.2015, AND IF  I HAD BEEN TOLD THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM LIKE THIS, I  WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT.  I CAN'T GET RID OF IT, AND I CAN'T TRADE IT IN ON ANOTHER VEHICLE, SO I'M BASICALLY SCREWED AND STILL OWE 64 MORE PAYMENTS OF $332.00 ON IT.

IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN MAY TIMES WHEN I START TO ACCELERATE THE GEARS PAUSES AND I HIT THE GAS AGAIN AND THE VEHICLE DOES NOT ACCELERATE AT ALL THE RPM'S GO UP SOMETIMES PAST 6 AND THE TRANSMISSION START BURNING. I EVEN GOT AN SAFETY DISPLAY MESSAGE THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS OVERHEATED AND TO PULL OVER FOR SAFETY UNTIL IT COOLS DOWN. NOTE I ONLY HAVE 5719 MILES AND MY 4TH TIME TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. I AM DRIVING IN FEAR EVERYTHING BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS WHEN IT WANTS TO SOMETIMES THE VEHICLES DRIVES PERFECT THEN THE NEXT MINUTE I'M HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.  THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING AT A STREET LIGHT, STOP SIGN, STOP AND GO TRAFFIC ON THE STREETS AND ON THE FREEWAY, WHEN I AM SLOWING DOWN TO MAKE A TURN THEN ACCELERATE AND IN THE MORNING, AFTERNOON AND AT NIGHT. I AM AFRAID WHEN I START TO ACCELERATE THEN THE NEXT SECOND I CANNOT ACCELERATE THAT THE CAR BEHIND ME OR IF I AM CHANGES LANES AND STOP ACCELERATING THAN ANOTHER VEHICLE WILL CRASH INTO ME. I DON'T KNOW IF THE PROBLEM IS THE ACTUAL TRANSMISSION AND OR SOFTWARE RELATED, BUT IT IS UNSAFE AND I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ANYMORE. THIS PROBLEM IS OFF AND AND ON, BUT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN IT DOES NOT STOP THE PROBLEM UNTIL I TURN THE CAR OFF. SOMETIMES IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN OR NOT. FOR EXAMPLE LAST TIME I HAD THE PROBLEM WAS ON SAT. NIGHT WHILE I WAS OUT WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR. THE TRANSMISSION WAS OVERHEATING, IT COOLED OFF AND ABOUT AN HOUR LATER I DRIVE IT HOME AND IT WAS OKAY. I DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING WITH NO ISSUES. I AM IN SALES AND DRIVE A LOT AND CANNOT AFFORD THESE ISSUES FOR SAFETY REASONS AND FOR WORK.",
