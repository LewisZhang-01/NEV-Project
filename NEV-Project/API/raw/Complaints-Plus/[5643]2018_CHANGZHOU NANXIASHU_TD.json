IT WAS VERY SCAREY TRYING TO PULL THE CAR DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE MOVEMENT ON THE FRAME. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NO HELP IN TRYING TO IMPROVE THE RIDE. I WONDER HOW MANY OF THESE ARE ON THE ROAD WITH LITTLE TO NO INSPECTION? COULD THIS BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS ATTENTION WITH ALL THE RV'S ON THE ROAD?  ## VIN FAILED ## CHANGZHOU TD 2018 ##",
