AFTER STARTING THE MOTOR, MANY TIMES THE WIPERS, RADIO, POWER WINDOWS AND INTERNAL FAN WILL NOT COME ON FOR AS LITTLE AS A FEW SECONDS OR AS LONG AS AN HOUR. IT DOES NOT TO ALWAYS HAPPEN, BUT VERY FREQUENTLY IT DOES. IT SOMETIMES SEEMS TO BE WEATHER RELATED... HEAT, COLD, RAINING OR SNOWING WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THE DANGER IS SHUTTING THE VEHICLE OFF ESPECIALLY ON A RAINY/SNOWY DAY, BEING AWAY FROM HOME AND THE WIPERS WILL NOT WORK WHEN RE-STARTING THE VEHICLE. I HAVE HAD THE FUSE AND COMPUTER  UNITS CHANGED (TOTAL FUSE POWER BOX REPLACED NEW ABOUT 1-1/2 YEARS AGO WHICH I WAS TOLD WAS AN UPGRADED BETTER SEALED UNIT AND THE COMPUTER ATTACHED IN FRONT OF IT REPLACED WITH A USED ONE ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO) BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.      IT IS MY OPINION THIS IS A DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IT CONCERNS THE WIPERS NOT ABLE TO WORK. I KNOW WHICH FUSE OPERATES THEM AND HAVE TRIED REPLACING IT, BUT THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS, IT WILL NOT CLICK ON UNTIL WHAT EVER IS CAUSING IT NOT TO DECIDES TO LET IT COME ON. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY DODGE AND NOT BE AN EXPENSE TO MYSELF OR ANY OTHER OWNER WHO HAS THIS PROBLEM.       THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY GRIEVANCE.  *TR",

OUR SON'S SITTER RAN SOME ERRANDS FOR ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL'S 1ST BIRTHDAY.  WHILE SHE WAS IN A HARDWARE STORE, PURCHASING DECORATIONS, THE MINIVAN, HOLDING FIVE CHILDREN (ALONG WITH MY SON) CAUGHT FIRE.  THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  I HOLD NO ANGER TOWARDS SUE LALUZERNE, THE SITTER.  SHE LOVED MY SON AND MY SON LOVED HER.  HOWEVER, I KNOW THAT MY SON'S DEATH WAS NOT IN VAIN.  HE WAS CALLED HOME TO JESUS FOR A REASON AND I FEEL IT'S MY CALLING TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.  THE MINIVAN WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.  MY SON WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE FROM SMOKE INHALATION AND SOOT.  HE PROBABLY ONLY TOOK TWO BREATHS BEFORE BECOMING UNCONSCIOUS.  ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR A VEHICLE BECOMING CONSUMED IN FLAMES IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.  MY SON WAS IN A CAR SEAT THAT WAS BUILT INTO THE MINIVAN; A SEAT THAT CONTAINED HIGHLY FLAMMABLE, TOXIC MATERIALS.  WE ARE WORKING WITH GIL ROSS, A LAWYER OUT OF CHICAGO, TO HELP US DURING THIS TIME.  THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COULD EVER EASE THE PAIN OF LOSING MY CHILD.  WHAT I REALLY WANT TO HAPPEN OUT OF ALL OF THIS IS FOR THE AUTO INDUSTRY TO STOP USING FLAMMABLE MATERIALS IN THEIR SEATS, ESPECIALLY IF CAR SEATS ARE BUILT IN.  I WANT PEOPLE TO BE TRAINED IN THE USE OF CAR SEATS IN CPR CLASSES ACROSS THE NATION AND A MECHANISM FOR QUICK RELEASE OF A CAR SEAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT OR FIRE.  I ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN MAKING THE WORLD AWARE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE AND HELPING US TO CHANGE THE SAFETY STANDARDS.  MY SON DESERVES THIS.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

UNTIL AROUND SEPTEMBER I WENT TO THE DEAL HAD TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGED AND A PERSON FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WANTED ME TO REPLACE SWAY BAR LINKS AND BUSHINGS FOR MY VEHICLE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS THIS ALL ABOUT SO I ASKED A LIST OF PARTS THAT HE REQUIRED ME FOR REPLACING.  I WENT HOME AND DID SOME RESEARCH ON THESE PARTS AND FOUND MANY OWNER OF THIS CARS COMPLAINT ABOUT A KNOCKING NOISE FROM THIS MODEL. AN OWNER WAS TOLD TO REPLACE HIS SWAY BAR LINKS AND BUSHINGS AND HE DID WHAT WAS TOLD BUT THE NOISE IS COMING BACK AFTER 6 MONTHS. MY CO-WORKER BOUGHT HIS CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY (2002 MODEL), WHICH IS THE SAME MODEL AS DODGE GRAND CARAVAN AROUND THE SAME TIME (2004) I BOUGHT MINE. IT'S MILEAGE IS AROUND 30K. HE GAVE ME A RIDE JUST 2 WEEKS AGO AND I FOUND THAT IT HAS THE KNOCKING NOISE TOO.  MY WORRY IS WILL THIS A SAFETY ISSUE OR NOT?

CHRYSLER SENT A FACTORY ENGINEER TO THE DEALERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE WHY IT COULDN'T BE FIXED.

NOISE IS FOCUSED AROUND WINDSHIELD AREA AND IS LOUD ENOUGH TO OBSCURE RADIO AND CONVERSATIONS IN A NORMAL VOLME BY PASSENGERS. ON EXTENDED TRAVEL, NOISE IS QUITE ANNOYING TO DRIVE AND PASSENGERS AND INCREASES FATIGUE FACTOR. THIS CREATES A SAFETY PROBLEM. THE MAJORITY OF MY DRIVING IS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. WITH THIS NOISE LEVEL, I WOULD CONSIDER THE VAN UNACCEPTABLE.",
