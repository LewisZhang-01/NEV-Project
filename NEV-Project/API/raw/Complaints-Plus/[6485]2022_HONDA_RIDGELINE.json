The brake warning light came on and the ABS locked up. The dash lit up and said \"Collision Mitigation System Problem\". The same CMS failure happened a half dozen times until I got it home. I took it to the dealership the next morning and on a test drive, the same thing happened to their service manager after resetting the system. They said the vehicle was not safe to drive. They kept it and are trying to get a radar sending unit but there are none. They have had the truck for almost 4 weeks. I have since read about this same failure mode going back to the 2017 model year.",

The contact's husband was able to drive the vehicle to the dealer where they diagnosed the vehicle with a possible battery failure. The battery was replaced and the vehicle was returned to the contact. Two days later while the contact was in a drive-thru line, a whitish-gray smoke started coming from the steering wheel.

The contact and her husband then exited the vehicle out of fear that the vehicle might catch on fire. The contact turned the vehicle off and the smoke stopped.
