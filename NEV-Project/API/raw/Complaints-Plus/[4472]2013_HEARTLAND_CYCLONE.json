WE THEN FOUND OUT FROM THE PARTS REPRESENTATIVE AND SEVERAL SALESPEOPLE THAT THE TIRES WE HAD WERE NOT SAFE FOR THIS VEHICLE. WE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER TO SEE IF WE COULD GET AN ADJUSTMENT FOR BETTER TIRES. THEY TOTALLY REFUSED. OUR VEHICLE IS A 40 FOOT TOY HAULER. WE FOUND OUT THAT THE TIRES THE MANUFACTURER IS PUTTING ON THESE VEHICLES ARE BARELY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THIS WEIGHT. THIS VEHICLE WHEN LOADED WITH PERSONAL ITEM, FOOD CLOTHING ETC AND A 4 WHEEL DRIVE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE FAR TOO HEAVY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TIRES. WE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT WE DID NOT FLY OFF THE HIGHWAY IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA. FORTUNATELY WE MADE IT HOME SAFE AND SOUND. WE HAD TO REPLACE ALL THE TIRES AT OUR OWN EXPENSE IN ORDER TO HAVE A SAFE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD. WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THE DOUBLE AXLE THAT WE HAVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. IT HAS A TENDENCY TO SWAY WHEN TRAVELING. HOW CAN THIS MANUFACTURER SELL AN UNSAFE VEHICLE LIKE THIS?  *TR",
