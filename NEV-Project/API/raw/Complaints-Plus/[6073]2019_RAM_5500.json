The vehicle stalled while depressing the accelerator pedal. Her husband pulled over to the side of the road and upon inspection, he discovered that smoke and a fire had started in the engine compartment. Her husband grabbed the fire extinguisher and extinguished the fire. The contact owns a towing company and was able to tow the vehicle to a dealer. The dealer informed the contact and her husband that a rod had gone through the engine block. The contact and her husband were provided an estimate for the repair which they declined. The contact had the engine replaced by an independent mechanic. Upon investigation, the contact discovered the vehicle had been placed under NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V439000 (Engine and Engine Cooling) which she linked to the failure. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and the contact was initially provided a case number. The contact then received a call from the manufacturer that her claim was denied. The vehicle was repaired. The failure mileage was 164,716",
