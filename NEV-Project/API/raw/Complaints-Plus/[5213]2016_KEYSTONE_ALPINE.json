WE HAVE NOTIFIED KEYSTONE OF THIS PROB AND HAVE HAD THE RV IN THE SHOP 2 TIMES AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A HYDRAULIC LEAK , AND STILL TO THIS DAY IT IS STILL THE SAME PROBLEM, SLIDEOUT  ARE COMING OUT GOING DOWN HIGHWAY. I AM TAKING THE RV BACK IN AGAIN TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP. THIS IS A HIGHWAY HAZARD WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION ON ANY ROAD OR HIGHWAY SLIDEOUT OUT COULD HIT ANYTHING IN ITS PATH. NOW AS WE TRAVEL WE HAVE TO STOP EVERY 40 MILES TO GET TO RV CONTROLS TO SLIDE THEM BACK IN. IT IS GETTING WORSE THEY   ARE COMING OUT MORE OFTEN. WE HAVE ALL RECORDS OF THIS PROBLEM , WHEN WE REPORTED IT TO KEYSTONE, AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPUTER GLITCH. IS THERE ANY CORRESPONDENCE YOU CAN SEND TO KEYSTONE TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED BEFORE IT CAUSES AN ACCIDENT?  *TR",

THE SHACKLE BOLTS FAILED TO THE NUTS BECAME LOOSE CAUSING THE SHACKLE PLATES TO FALL OFF THE TRAILER. THE CONDITION WAS DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE TRAILER COULD HAVE FLIPPED WHEN TOWED. I HAD TO HAVE THE TRAILER SUSPENSION REPAIRED. THE SHACKLE BOLTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE UNDERSIZED FOR THE TRAILER AND THE CORES HAD BEEN BORED TO ALLOW GREASE FITTING TO BE INSTALLED IN THE HEADS OF THE BOLTS WEAKENING THE STRUCTURAL STRNGTH. THE BOLTS WERE REPLACED WITH SOLID BOLTS AT ALL POINTS OF THE SUSPENSION TO PREVENT FURTHER FAILURE.  I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY MY DEALER THAT FOREST RIVER HAS RECALLED TRAILERS USING THE LIPPERT SELF-ALIGNING SUSPENSION BECAUSE THE SHACKLE BOLTS SHEAR OFF. THIS ISSUE WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUE AS MINE. MORE IMAGES AVAILABLE!",
