The car had to be towed to the dealership. On Tuesday, Feb. 15, the dealership told me they performed a software update and the car was running again, but they wanted to keep it another night. On Wed., Feb. 16, the dealership called again to tell me the same situation that occurred on 2/14 happened again. They told me the codes that were given were related to the transmission. They said the transmission had to be replaced. The car is 5 years old. I asked about the transmission control module, and they said the entire transmission had to be replaced in order to replace the TCM.  I took the car in after a recall notice was received in January 2022. I was told the recall only required an inspection, so there was no software update at that time. The tech told me that the original software update was done in April 2021. We received a 2nd recall notice this week saying the prior software update had an error and needed to be updated. The tech told me this is the update they did on 2/15.   The dealership is telling me I need a new transmission. I'm having a hard time trusting anyone at the dealership.",

I cannot afford to pay for this and I do believe that Kia needs to make this right.  Because everything electrical plugs into this one wiring harness, they have to replace the whole thing costing over $3600.  There was no warnings or lights that came on.

I brought the vehicle to Willowbrook Kia and they stated that they would need to do an oil consumption test.  After the 1st test, it showed that I burned 3 quarts after 1,200 miles driven.  Kia completed an intake carbon test and had me drive it for another 1,000 miles.  After the 2nd test, it showed that I burned 1.5 quarts of oil after 1,000 miles.  Willowbrook Kia stated that the engine needed to be replaced and it will be under warranty.  They rented me a car which they paid for and it took me to call after 1 week in a half and they stated that the vehicle is not covered under warranty as I am the 2nd owner of the vehicle.  The gentleman (Vic) at Kia told me the only way to get Kia to replace the engine is to drive it until their is no oil and the engine seizes.  I explained to him that I drive on the expressway everyday and that is kind of like an accident waiting to happen.  No accident has happened as of yet, but thought I would at least try and send a complaint your way.  If there is nothing that can be done, I completely understand, but was trying to avoid a possible accident in the future.",

I REALIZED THE POWER OFF SO I SWITCHED THE IGNITION TO OFF AND TURNED IT ON AGAIN TO START THE ENGINE AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE GLITCH. IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON OCT 26, 2019 WHEN I WAS ON THE DRIVE THRU OF TACO BELL. I WAS WAITING IN LINE AND AGAIN, WHEN I LIFTED MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE TO MOVE FORWARD, IT WOULDN'T MOVE BECAUSE THE POWER HAD JUST SHUT OFF AGAIN. I HAD TO RESTART THE ENGINE. I COMPLAINED TO MY SON ABOUT THE CAR BUT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WAS PAST THE 7 DAY EXCHANGE OR RETURN. BUT PLANNED TO BRING IT UP ON MY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE UNLESS IT HAPPENS AGAIN. I WAS ALWAYS CAUTIOUS AND WORRIED THAT I WILL STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC OR WORSE, WHILE DRIVING. MOSTLY THE REASON WHY I'VE ONLY DRIVEN THE CAR LESS THAN 300 MILES SINCE I BOUGHT IT ABOUT 4.5 MONTHS AGO. THEN YESTERDAY MORNING, JAN 28, 2020, ON MY ERRANDS TO TWO DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS, THE PASSENGER SEATBELT SIGN WAS BEEPING AND FLASHING THE WHOLE TIME I DROVE AROUND THAT DAY, WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY WITH ME IN THE CAR. IT FINALLY STOPPED WHEN IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN I WAS CLOSE TO HOME AND AFTER I PICKED MY PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE PHARMACY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE. NOW I AM CURIOUS AND WONDERING WHY THE NAVY MAN TRADED THIS CAR IN WHEN HE'D ONLY HAD IT FOR LA YEAR AND SPENT MONEY ON NEW BLACK RIMS AND BLACKED OUT TINTED WINDOWS.
