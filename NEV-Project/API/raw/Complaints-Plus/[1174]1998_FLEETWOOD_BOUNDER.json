WHILE ON TEST DRIVE THE ABS SYSTEM ENTERED FALSE DEPLOYMENT MODE AT 15MPH WHILE APPROACHING A BUSY HIGHWAY INTERSECTION. I HAD TO STAND ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH BOTH FEET AND SLAM THE TRANSMISSION INTO LOW TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO STOP. THE NOSE OF THE COACH ENDED BLOCKING HALF A LANE OF TRAFFIC. NO ACCIDENT. FYI, THIS VEHICLE GVW IS 20,000 LBS.        ( NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS TECHNICAL IN NATURE.) I DROVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE SHOP TO INITIATE INVESTIGATION. USING A DVOM I MEASURED THE VOLTAGE AMPLITUDE OUT OF THE NEW WHEEL SPEED SENSORS. THE FRONT LEFT MEASURED .068V AC AND THE FRONT RIGHT MEASURED .286V AC. THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE FALSE DEPLOYMENT. I THEN REMOVED THE FRONT WHEELS TO INSPECT THE SENSORS AND DISCOVERED THE SOURCE OF THE FAILURE. THE REPLACEMENT SENSORS ARE MANUFACTURE WITHOUT LOCATION DOWELS. THE LOCATION DOWELS SET THE CRITICAL CLEARANCE GAP BETWEEN THE RELUCTOR AND SENSOR. THIS CLEARANCE GAP HAS A NARROW PLUS OR MINUS TOLERANCE. WHEN THE TOLERANCE IS LOST THE ABS SYSTEM WILL ENTER A FALSE DEPLOYMENT MODE ( ABS SYSTEM ACTIVATES AND BLOCKS BRAKE FLUID PRESSURE BEING APPLIED TO THE BRAKE CALIPERS ). THE NEW REPLACEMENT ABS SENSORS HAVE NO LOCATION DOWELS THERE FOR TOLERANCES AS DESIGNED ARE NOT ACHIEVED. THIS IS WHY I LOST CONTROL OF 10 TONS OF VEHICLE.
