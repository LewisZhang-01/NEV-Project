THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OF 4 OTHER COROLLA'S I HAVE OWNED THAT RESPONDED LIKE THIS.  DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DECLINE THE SPEED WILL INCREASE FROM 5 TO 15 MPH AND THE ENGINE REVS TO 4,000 RPMS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN SPEED.  ADAM'S TOYOTA DEALERSHIP HAS STATED THAT THIS IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE FOR ALL 2017 COROLLA'S CVT'S AND I MAINTAIN IT'S NOT AND CRUISE IS USELESS THEREFORE I SHOULD BE REIMBURSED.  THE CRUISE CONTROL IN ALL OTHER VEHICLES (PRIOR COROLLA'S AND OTHER MAKES) I HAVE OWNED HAS MAINTAINED A CONSISTENT SPEED NO MATTER THE ROAD BEING TRAVELED. SINCE I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE THIS ISSUE HAS OCCURRED EVERY TIME I HAVE ENGAGED THE CRUISE CONTROL.  OTHERS ONLINE HAVE COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. TOYOTA PLEASE PROVIDE FIX",

JUST AS SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED, IT CANNOT CONTROL THE SPEED WHEN GOING DOWN HILL. IT RAISES THE RPM'S TRYING TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN, BUT IT ISN'T VERY EFFECTIVE. I'VE NEVER HAD ANOTHER CAR OR ANOTHER TOYOTA HAVE SUCH POOR SPEED CONTROL. SO MUCH, THAT I DON'T EVEN BOTHER TRYING TO USE IT ANYMORE. A COP ISN'T GOING TO LISTEN TO \"MY CRUISE CONTROL WASN'T WORKING RIGHT\" IF I GET PULLED OVER. THE BRAKES ALREADY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE WEARING OUT AT 26K MILES. MY 13 CAMRY HAD 30K AND THE BRAKES STILL FELT BRAND NEW. SAME WITH THE 15 SENTRA I HAD. THE SUSPENSION FEELS ROUGHER AND IS STARTING TO MAKE NOISES ALREADY.

AFTER AWHILE THE RPM WOULD DROP BACK DOWN TO NORMAL FOR THE SPEED SITUATION.  THIS OCCURS ALSO AT HIGHWAY SPEED OF 60 MPH IN OUR AREA.  THIS OCCURRENCE HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES.  HAVE RETURNED TO DEALER TWICE NOW.  PROBLEM WAS OBSERVED BY SERVICE MANAGER AND LOCAL TOYOTA REP WHO WAS IN TOWN FOR LOCAL AUTO SHOW.   CAR WAS ANALYZED AND DATA SEND TO ENGINEER IN CALIFORNIA WHO LATER SAID CAR IS BEHAVING NORMAL.   I FOUND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE AS BOTH LOANER CARS (2017 COROLLA) DID NOT BEHAVE IN THIS DANGEROUS FASHION.   I FEEL THIS QUICK BRUSH OFF BY THE ENGINEER (TANAKA) WHO IS ONLY OBSERVING DATA AND NOT HAVING TO DRIVE THIS CAR IS WRONG.   I FEEL THE COMPUTER SHOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR THE CVT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.   WIFE DOES NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  WE HAVE TAKEN 3 VIDEOS TO DOCUMENT THIS EVENT.",

DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DECLINE THE SPEED WILL INCREASE FROM 5 TO 15 MPH. WHEN USING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND MAINTAINING THE EXACT SAME PRESSURE THE VEHICLE ONLY INCREASES SPEED MINIMALLY (2 TO 3 MPH) ON THE DECLINE. WHEN IN CRUISE CONTROL THE SPEED INCREASE IS VERY DRASTIC. THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP HAS STATED THAT THIS IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE AND THAT THEY HAVE TESTED SEVERAL SAME MODEL AND YEAR TOYOTA VEHICLES AND ALL HAVE THE SAME SPEEDING TENDENCIES SO THIS IS NORMAL. THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THE FIX IS TO ENGAGE THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION MODE TO USE THE ENGINE COMPRESSION TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN. I HAVE FOLLOWED THERE ADVICE AND THIS DOES NOT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THE CRUISE CONTROL IN ALL VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED IS USED TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT SPEED NO MATTER THE TERRAIN BEING TRAVERSED.
