HIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A CATASTROPHIC SITUATION, BUT FORTUNATELY DID NOT.  ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC WHO REPAIRED THE VEHICLE, THE BRAKE FLUID OVERHEATED. I BELIEVE THAT THE PLACEMENT OF THE BRAKE FLUID RESEVOIR HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO THE FAILURE. ON THIS VEHICLE THE RESEVOIR IS INBOARD OF THE DRIVER-SIDE FRONT WHEEL, BETWEEN THE CHASSIS AND THE ENGINE, WHERE HEAT FROM THE ENGINE CAN AFFECT IT.*AK",
