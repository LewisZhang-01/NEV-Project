AS NOTED, I EXPERIENCED 3 REVVING INCIDENTS IN WHICH THE ENGINE ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY TO OVER 7,000 RPM AND WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. FORTUNATE, THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED ON EACH OCCASION AND DID NOT SURGE AHEAD WHILE I PRESSED FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE AND SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL. THE REVVING STOPPED ON ITS OWN AFTER A SHORT TIME. IN EACH INSTANCE I DELIVERED THE VEHICLE TO A BMW DEALERSHIP--THE FIRST TIME IN SARASOTA, FL AND THEN TWICE IN ROCKVILLE, MD--AND BMW MECHANICS WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY CAUSE OR FLAW. FOLLOWING THE THIRD EVENT, BMW OF NORTH AMERICA DESPATCHED AN ENGINEER TO ROCKVILLE FOR A COMPLETE EXAM ON OCTOBER 4, 2018. THE ENGINEER REPORTED THE VEHICLE TO BE IN PERFECT RUNNING CONDITION IN EVERY RESPECT. BASED ON THIS REPORT, BMW NA REFUSED MY REQUEST TO TERMINATE MY LEASE EARLY, WITHOUT PENALTY. IT ALSO DISMISSED MY PERSONAL  VIEW THAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE A SOFTWARE GLITCH THAT THE ENGINEER OR BMW MECHANICS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO UNCOVER OR DUPLICATE. AS MY WIFE AND I WERE UNWILLING TO DRIVE A CAR ON PUBLIC ROADS THAT WE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A LIFE-THREATENING DEFECT, WE SUBMITTED TO BMW'S DEMAND THAT WE PAY OFF IN A LUMP SUM THE REMAINING TWO YEARS OF OUR LEASE THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF 2020, AMOUNTING TO OVER $17,000. BMW'S POLICY OF REFUSING TO ACCEPT RESPOSIBILITY FOR REVVING PROBLEMS UNDOUBTEDLY FORCES SOME DRIVERS TO KEEP DRIVING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS VEHICLES, RISKING PUBLIC SAFETY. I AM ALSO APPALLED AT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT BMW HAS LEASED OR RESOLD THE SAME VEHICLE, THEREBY PROFITING TWICE FOR THE PERIOD OF MY TERMINATED LEASE, WHILE FAILING TO REVEAL THE CAR'S HISTORY OF REVVING TO THE NEW OWNER/DRIVER.

IT THEN PROCEEDED TO BURN FAST AND HOT AND THERE WERE 30 FOOT FLAMES THAT HAD RUINED OUR FENCE AS WELL AS SINGED OUR NEIGHBORS TREE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND FINALLY TOOK OUT THE FLAME BUT THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY RUINED.  THE TOW TRUCK SHOWED UP LATER BUT HE REFUSED TO TOW THE VEHICLE BECAUSE HE SAW SMOKE AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE HAD CAUGHT BACK ON FIRE ON THE PASSENGER WINDOW SIDE.  AIRBAGS HAD ALSO STARTED BLOWING UP WHEN THE SECOND FIRE CAUGHT.  I HAD PUT MY HEAD INTO THE WINDOW WHEN THE FIRE WAS OUT TO RETRIEVE ANYTHING THAT I COULD BUT WITHIN 10 SECONDS OF PULLING MY HEAD OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE ANOTHER AIRBAG WENT OFF AND ALMOST TOOK OFF MY HEAD.  THERE WAS A DUAL INVESTIGATION WITH BMW AND MY INSURANCE SAFECO.  THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.  INITIAL REPORT SAID THE DEFECT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FUEL LINE.

I HAVE CONTACTED BMW NA ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE DEALER'S STATEMENT THAT THIS STEERING ISSUE IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC. BMW NA HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY TECHNICAL GUIDANCE OR OPINION AND THEY REDIRECT ME BACK TO THE DEALER. THEIR OVERALL VERDICT IS THAT IF MORE THAN ONE VEHICLES EXHIBIT THE ISSUE, THEN IT IS NORMAL, AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.    NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE IF X3 MODELS WITH ELECTRIC STEERING HAVE THIS STEERING ISSUE AND POSSIBLY ASK BMW TO RECALL BECAUSE IT IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE.",
