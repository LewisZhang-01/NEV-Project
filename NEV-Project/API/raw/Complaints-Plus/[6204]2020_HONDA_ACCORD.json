I first noticed issues with the breaking system, previously on 3 other occasions throughout my time of owning/leasing the vehicle. 3 other occasions before receiving an alert on the screen that read \"the brake system has a problem. Avoid high speeds and sudden braking. Have your vehicle checked by a dealer immediately.\" That was February 13, 2022. I called immediately to take my car in and was told I would have to pay out of pocket to have this issue addressed which seems outrageous to me since it is something that I have no control over. So without the ability to pay such a high fee for a vehicle that I thought would keep me safe, I took it to a local auto shop and had my brakes checked while I had my routine maintenance done. I was told everything was fine, which in my opinion indicates it is at fault of the manufacturers.. I don't want to die before something is done. There have been many claims about the same thing happening. I'm truly shocked there hasn't been a recall due to this issue.",

        "summary": "Hi, Monday I bought a 2020 used certified Honda accord with approx 19k miles that is presenting problems with the electric steering box. considering the vehicle that I traded in for this, an 2019 honda civic had the same part replaced under warranty at approx 28k miles and my accord has similarities to that problem. today 03/02/22, I took my car to the dealer but the technician said couldn't see the problem. the problem is: in an intermittent way while driving, the steering wheel tends to do micro jumps instead of smooth moving. also, today driving at highway speeds (70, but it happens at different speeds) I noticed while making a very smooth right curve it got \"stick\" in the position it was forcing me to apply a little more strength to have it centered again instead of just letting it go by itself. I have mechanical knowledge and I can affirm there's something wrong with it once I already checked alignment and suspension parts and everything seems good. now, the problem is, the dealership doesn't see it and I'm concerned about having an accident or something. I work as a delivery driver in this car and I need it for making my living. Intermittent problems are complicated especially to be noticed/caught. but not less important, I fear for my life and other people's life on the road. I'm also contacting honda about this because there are other cars out there with similar problems. It's my second honda and I'm very disappointed. They need to add a heat shield or something similar between the steering box and the exhaust on their turbo-charged engines. Turbo engines produce great power and also heat. that might be damaging their car's steering system over time. I saw reports where people say they have it replaced 3 times already. anyways, I hope someone can help me with this issue. I'll also leave a link where people are discussing the same problem: https://www.accordxclub.com/threads/steering-issue-jumps-from-center.2144/ if you search. there is even more.  Thank you.",

The sudden and unexpected booming noise startled the driver causing temporary loss of control of the vehicle. The solution has already been identified in a Service Bulletin from Honda as Service Bulletin 21-053. The ANC unit has incorrect software and requires replacement to fix and eliminate the safety hazard. The issue was noted June 29th, 2021; but, has not been escalated as a Safety Recall. I have replaced the ANC as directed by the Service Bulletin and it has resolved the problem; however, other Honda vehicles have this same safety issue and if not Recalled will continue to be a safety concern for all drivers on our highway. I would like to see this escalated to a Safety Recall level and customers notified to replace. I am disappointed that Honda has not proactively Recalled this.",

Most of the items may or may not have actually quit working but their problem lights stayed on. Still it is no fun driving without cruise when your wife has breast cancer and you have have to drive 3 hours each way to Gainesville, Florida for treatment. I assume all the warning lights functions still worked, but it is hard to tell if things like the brakes were pr were not working when driving as they seemed to work fine. So I soon afterwards took the car into the dealer on December 11, 2021 in Leesburg, Florida. But by this time all the dash lights remained off as they are supposed to. So all they did was change the oil and did non-compliance recall BMC software update 20-039 and BGCM software update. The reason I brought the car in was not specified on my invoice. However, The dealer did say that my transponder for the EZ highway system was blocking the camera on the mirror. I believed them. Since then, however, today all the cash lights again said they were crashing again just before a 2-hour drive to the Gainesville cancer hospital. Upon return the lights went back to normal. I don't believe Honda dealers know what the problem is or why it continues in many millions of similar Hondas. My research on the Internet found at different complaints about said dashboard lights crashing causing similar problems. Most of these complaints had the dealers fix \"the problem\" and charging fees but again the customers reported do-over same problems.",

Today May 17 2021 I was not feeling ill at work and went to sit in my car to roll down the windows to get a breeze and again the passenger front seat window is stuck.  One or two times it seemed like it didn\u2019t work but on the next try it did after the repair.   now it\u2019s frozen again.     Having non-operational windows is a safety hazard and a passenger hazard, and a law enforcement hazard if pulled over and the window will not roll down.  It is stuck in the up position.

ONCE THEY PROCEEDED, THEY STATED THEY FOCUSED ON CLEANING THE SPARK PLUGS AND PERFORMING AN OIL CHANGE WHICH LED THEM TO FIND OUT THERE IS INTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE. SO THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD STOP UNTIL MY INSURANCE COMPANY CHECKS THE CAR. THEY SAID THEY TOOK MULTIPLE FUEL SAMPLES AND DID NOT SEE WATER BUT THERE WAS WATER FILLED IN THE ENGINE CYLINDERS. THEY HAVE ASKED ME IF THE CAR WAS IN A FLOOD, BUT THERE WAS NO MASSIVE RAIN OR STORM WHICH FLOODED THE AREA.

THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME IF THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE OIL AND FUEL TANK, THEN THE ONLY WAY THAT WATER CAN GET INTO THE ENGINE IS MANUALLY POURING LOTS OF WATER THROUGH AIR INTAKE, WHICH ALSO SOUNDS RIDICULOUS AS I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED IT NOR THERE WAS NO TRACE OF SOMEONE TRYING TO OPEN MY HOOD FROM INSIDE AND PUTTING WATER.
