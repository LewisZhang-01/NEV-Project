MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO PUT IN NEUTRAL BEFORE LOSING MUCH SPEED AND TRIED TO CRANK SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE HITTING MY FLASHERS BECAUSE THERE WERE A FEW CARS BEHIND ME ON A 2 LANE ROAD WITH VERY LITTLE SHOULDER ROOM TO PULL OVER OFF ROAD. I POPPED THE GOOD TO SEE IF I COULD SEE OR MAYBE EVEN SMELL ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. I'M MAKING SURE MY BATTERY CABLES AREN'T LOOSE, NO FLUIDS LEAKING OR SPEWING AND LUCKILY A STATE TROOPER WAS PASSING THRU AND STOPPED TO SEE IF I NEEDED HELP AND TURNED HIS LIGHTS ON SO TRAFFIC WOULD KNOW THERE WERE PROBLEMS AND COULD SLOWLY GO AROUND. TO MY SURPRISE, AFTER EXPLAINING WHAT HAPPENED, HE SAID HE HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE WITH HIS DAUGHTERS CAR, 2002 IMPALA, AND TOLD ME TO TRY THE 10 MINUTE RESET PROCEDURE AND SURE ENOUGH,  AFTER THAT 10 MINUTE RESET, SHE FIRED RIGHT HOME AND WAS ABLE TO GET HOME, HOME  HAD HE NOT COME ALONG AND ALREADY KNOWN BOUT THIS FAULTY SYSTEM PRIOR, MY DAUGHTER AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK FOR SOME TIME ON THE SIDE OF A 2 LANE HIGHWAY IN THE EARLY SEPTEMBER HUMIDITY MOST LIKELY WAITING FOR A TOW.

ONE MONTH AGO, ITS BODY COMPUTER MEMORY WENT BONKERS.  THE DAY AFTER I RETURNED AFTER XMAS, I WENT TO GET GROCERY.  AS THE CAR WAS NORMAL THE PREVIOUS DAY, I DID NOT EXPECT ANY PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, UPON FINISHING SHOPPING 30 MINUTES LATER, I FOUND THE CAR (1) HONKING NON-STOP, (2) ITS DOME LIGHTS COULD NOT BE TURNED OFF, (3) THE 'DOOR AJAR' WARNING JINGLED ALL THE WAY ' EVEN THOUGH I STOPPED BY ROADSIDE TO ENSURE ALL DOORS WERE CLOSED.  ON TOP OF THAT, (4) THE TURNING SIGNALS (BOTH LEFT & RIGHT) STOPPED WORKING.  ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER RETURNING HOME AND LOCKING UP THE CAR, (5) THE HONKING/DOME LIGHTS/DOOR WARNING STARTED AGAIN.  ALTHOUGH I RESET THE CONTROL PANEL, THE PROBLEMS DID NOT GO AWAY.  I THEREFORE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, BUT THEIR MECHANIC COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSES OFFHANDEDLY, AND AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE TO THOROUGHLY CHECK THE CAR WITH DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS.  HOWEVER, ON THE DAY OF THE APPOINTMENT (1/26/16), EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AGAIN, AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG BY THE DEALER.   TODAY (2/12/16), THE TURNING SIGNALS MALFUNCTIONED AGAIN BRIEFLY AND WORKED AGAIN, BUT (6) THE INSTRUMENT PANELS WERE ALL ERRONEOUS, WITH READINGS OF FUEL, COOLANT TEMPERATURE, TACHOMETER ABOVE LIMITS - EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS STATIONARY.    I EXPECT THAT IT IS A MATTER OF TIME THAT (7) THE SPEEDOMETER WILL ALSO GO DEFECTIVE.  AT THAT TIME, THE DASH BOARD WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED AS A WHOLE, COSTING MORE THAN $500 DOLLARS.     OBVIOUSLY, THE COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING RIGHT.  I SHOULD ADD THAT MY CAR HAS BEEN MAINTAINED REGULARLY WITH THE DEALER.   I HOPE MY REPORT WILL BRING NHTSA'S ATTENTION TO THE ABOVE PARTS/WORKMANSHIP PROBLEMS OF GM.",

NEITHER WANT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CODES, BECAUSE OF WASTING MONEY ON PARTS THAT MAY NOT BE NEEDED, WHICH I APPRECIATE, BUT YET IS FRUSTRATING.    WHEN I GOOGLE MY ISSUE ONLINE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT IDEAS ON WHAT TO REPLACE BUT NO SPECIFICS. SEEMS LIKE MANY ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH DEALERSHIPS....STATING CHEVY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM AND HAVE A RECALL OF SOME SORT. I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE REPLACING PARTS JUST TO SEE IF IT'S THE PROBLEM. I HAVE ALREADY PAID $42 TO THE DEALERSHIP TO DRIVE MY CAR ALL DAY TO SEE IF IT WOULD DO THE PROBLEM. ONLINE IDEAS ARE  STATING AS SIMPLE AS REPLACE THE GAS TANK CAP TO ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILURE.    I HAD SIMILAR ISSUES BACK IN 6/2009,  CODE WAS READ AND THEY REPLACED THE PASSLOCK SENSOR, THEN HAD TO REPLACE IT AGAIN IN 7/2010",

NUMBER 3 THE GAGES TO MY SPEEDOMETER AND GAS MOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND DOESN'T GIVE ME THE ACCURATE READING. OTHER EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD NOTICED IS THAT MY BRIGHTS DON'T ALWAYS LIKE TO SHUT OFF THE FIRST TIME, THE CAR PULLS MAINLY TO THE RIGHT, BUT ALSO BACK AND FORTH.

WE FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, NO MATTER THE AGE OF THE CAR OR THE MILEAGE, AND SHOULD BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY PAID FOR BY GENERAL MOTORS.  WE THEN FILED A COMPLAINT WITH GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND HAVE BEEN ADVISED THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO ASSIST US WITH THE COST. WE CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THE REACTION WOULD BE IF AN ELDERLY PERSON OR AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER WERE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND THEIR SPEEDOMETER SHOT UP TO 90-100 MPH WHAT THEIR REACTION WOULD BE.

EVENTUALLY AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES THE CAR WILL START- I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED THE STARTER BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.  I HAVE HAD THE CAR CHECKED OUT AT 2 DIFFERENT SHOPS (FIRESTONE) AND THEY CANNOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  THERE ARE NO CODES COMING UP. THEY ARE COMPLETELY PERPLEXED. CHEVY STATES THEIR MECHANICS ARE BETTER.  ALSO THE CLUSTER PANEL IS GONE AND CHEVY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THEY ONLY RECALLED CERTAIN MODELS AND DID NOT INCLUDE THE IMPALAS.  I HAVE 2 ESTIMATES REGARDING FIXING THIS PROBLEM BUT THE QUOTES ARE $500.00. I DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS WHEN CHEVY KNEW THEY HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH CLUSTER PANELS AND OMITTED THE IMPALAS IN THEIR RECALL.  SO, TO RECAP: THE CAR DIES IN TRAFFIC (ALMOST HIT TWICE), I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH GAS I HAVE, HOW FAST I AM GOING, OR IF THE CAR IS OVERHEATING.

THE CAR WOULD EVENTUALLY START AFTER 15 ? 30 MINUTES. AT FIRST, THIS OCCURRED SPORADICALLY BUT THEN BECAME A MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE. WHEN I TOOK MY IMPALA TO A LOCAL AUTO-REPAIR SHOP, THEY WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSIS THE EXACT PROBLEM. THEIR EQUIPMENT REPORTED A NUMBER OF ELECTRONIC ERRORS BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PINPOINT THE PRECISE CAUSE OF THE CAR?S ISSUES. INSTEAD, THEY OFFERED TO RESET THE ELECTRONIC CODES AND ADVISED ME TO BRING MY CAR BACK AT THE FIRST SIGN OF ANY ELECTRONIC ISSUES. MY IMPALA OPERATED FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WITHOUT ISSUE. HOWEVER, A NEW ELECTRONIC ISSUE EMERGED WITH MY VEHICLE. I NOTICED MY CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AUTOMATICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP, THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AT A MODERATE AMOUNT OF SPEED AS SOON AS I RELEASED THE BRAKE. LIKE THE PREVIOUS ISSUE, THIS PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY AND SOON PROGRESSED TO A REGULAR OCCURRENCE. WHEN I TOOK THE IMPALA BACK TO THE AUTO-REPAIR SHOP, THE MECHANICS STATED THE AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION WAS DUE TO A FAULTY IGNITION SENSOR. AFTER I HAD THE FAULTY IGNITION SENSOR REPLACED, THE IMPALA ONCE AGAIN RAN WITHOUT ISSUE FOR A FEW MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE SOLUTION PROVED TEMPORARY AS THE PREVIOUS AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION ISSUE RETURNED. I ONCE AGAIN TOOK MY CAR TO THE AUTO-REPAIR SHOP AND ONCE AGAIN, THE MECHANICS BLAMED A FAULTY IGNITION SENSOR. AT THIS POINT, I HAD THE MECHANICS REPLACE THE IGNITION SENSOR. SINCE THAT POINT, MY CAR HAS OPERATED WITHOUT ISSUE UNTIL TODAY. THE SECURITY LIGHT IN MY DRIVERS PANEL NOW CONTINUALLY DISPLAYS WHENEVER I DRIVE. I FEEL AS IF I AM AT THE END OF MY ROPE.

A QUICK SEARCH ONLINE ALSO REVEALED THAT IT IS A SEVERE PROBLEM, AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EITHER PULLED OVER, OR HAD BEEN GOING MUCH TO FAST BEFORE NOTICING.

THE MECHANIC AT SANGER FORD STATED THAT IT WAS THE CLUSTER AND IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND TOLD US IT WOULD COST $507.45 TO REPLACE. WE HAVE SINCE SPOKEN TO GM, WHO INSTRUCTED US TO GET A DIAGNOSTIC AND THEY WOULD TAKE IT FROM THERE. WE PAID $85 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC AT TOM BENSON CHEVROLET IN SAN ANTONIO, TX. GM THEN TOLD US THAT THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THE CLUSTER ON THE IMPALA, BUT THERE ARE RECALLS ON THE CHEVY TAHOE, SUBURBAN AND THE SILVERADO AND THAT IF WE WANTED IT REPLACED WE COULD DEDUCT THE COST OF THE DIAGNOSTIC FROM WHAT TOM BENSON WANTED TO CHARGE TO REPLACE IT, WHICH WAS $500.

THIS MEANS NO TEMPERATURE GAUGE, NO SPEEDOMETER, AND NO FUEL GAUGE. I CHECK FLUID LEVELS EVERY WEEK. I FILL UP MY TANK EVERY SATURDAY AND WEDNESDAY. I AM STUCK AND SICK OF THIS BECAUSE I CAN NOT AFFORD TO GET TWO THINGS FIXED THAT SHOULD ONLY STOP WORKING ON OLD CARS. THIS CAR IS 4 YEARS OLD.  *TR",

OUR CASE # IS 71-578092134. THEY WERE NO HELP, SINCE OUR WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED. OUR TRACTION SYSTEM & CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON. THE TRACTION SYSTEM SHUT OFF & WOULD NOT TURN BACK ON. IT ALSO KNOCKED OFF THE ABS SYSTEM. NOT SAFE. WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC, THE REPAIRS WERE A NEW THERMOSTAT & THERMOSTAT SENSOR, & DRIVERS SIDE REAR HUB BEARING. THE COST WAS $500.00, THE DEALERSHIP WANTED @1100.00!!!!!!! FOR THE SAME REPAIRS. THE REPAIR SHOP STATED TO ME THAT THEY HAVE APPROXIMATELY 5-10 IMPALAS A WEEK IN THEIR SHOP FOR THE SAME REPAIR!!! IT APPEARS GM SCREWED UP. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THIS PROBLEM. WE ALSO OWN A 1995 GMC 1500 SIERRA, HAVE NOT HAD TO FIX ANYTHING AS MAJOR AS THE IMPALA.

I GOT OFF THE HWY AT THE 1ST EXIT AND WAITED UNTIL DAYLIGHT TO GO CONTINUE TO WORK. I WENT TO THE 1ST MECHANIC THAT OPENED AND THE LIGHTS WERE WORKING AGAIN SO THE MECHANIC COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. 1 YEAR LATER ON 2/12/08, MY 7YEAR OLD SON AND I WENT TO THE DRUG STORE TO GET HIS MEDICATION AND AS WE WERE DRIVING UP SR 139, I NOTICED THAT I COULDN'T SEE THE ROAD!!! AGAIN, I'M ON A STRETCH OF ROAD WITH NO STREET LIGHTS AND THIS TIME I HAVE INTERIOR LIGHTS, BLINKERS AND PARKERS, BUT I HAVE NO HEADLIGHTS. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND CUT THE CAR OFF HOPING TO RESET THE COMPUTER OR WHATEVER WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND WHEN I RESTARTED THE CAR THE HEADLIGHTS STILL DIDN'T COME ON.  I WAITED APPROX 45 MINUTES AND STILL IN THE DARK. I WAS SOOO AFRAID BECAUSE I HAD MY SON WITH ME AND I HAD ABOUT 2.5 MILES TO GO BEFORE GETTING HOME. I TOOK MY CHANCES AND DROVE HOME TRYING TO BE AS CAREFUL AS POSSIBLE AS ONCOMING CARS FLASHED THEIR LIGHTS AT ME AND HONKED. MY SON WAS SCARED AND KEPT ASKING IF OTHER CARS WERE GOING TO HIT US OR IF THEY COULD SEE US. I TRIED TO STAY CALM FOR HIM, BUT TRUTHFULLY, I WAS SCARED STUPID. I'VE BEEN READING UP ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS AND GM HAS GOT TO STEP UP AND FIX THIS PROBLEM. WHY SHOULD IT TAKE FOR SOMEONE TO LOOSE THEIR LIFE FOR GM TO TAKE NOTICE??? I'VE OWNED A 99 GRAND AM, 00 OLDSMOBILE ALERO & NOW THE THE 04 IMPALA. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD MOVED UP AND BOUGHT A REALLY GOOD CAR THAT I LOVED NOT A DEATH MACHINE.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, ONE MORNING I NOTICED THAT I WAS DRIVING THROUGH A PARKING LOT AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MILES PER HOUR, THINKING \"IT SURE DOESN'T FEEL THAT FAST.\"  AFTER APPLYING THE BRAKE I OBSERVED THE SPEEDOMETER DROP ONLY TO ABOUT 50 MPH.  LATER THAT DAY I FOUND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE SPEEDOMETER BACK TO ZERO WAS TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND RESTART IT SEVERAL TIMES AS THE NEEDLE WOULD DROP ABOUT 10 MPH EACH TIME.  ONCE AT ZERO THE SPEEDOMETER APPEARED TO READ CORRECTLY.  OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE PROBLEM CONTINUED THOUGH IT WAS REMARKABLY WORSE THE COLDER THE CAR WAS.  BY NOW, JANUARY 08 THE SPEEDOMETER HAS STOPPED READING ACCURATELY ALTOGETHER AND HAS PARKED ITSELF AT THE 360 DEGREE MARK.  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN CHEVY AND CADILLAC TRUCKS BUT GM HAS BEEN SLOW TO ISSUE ANY SPECIAL POLICIES OR RECALLS REGARDING THE CARS.  THE PARTS (SPECIFICALLY FAULTY STEPPER MOTORS MANUFACTURED BY DELPHI) BY ALL ACCOUNTS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESEARCH HOWEVER ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF MODEL.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE PRIMARILY AS WELL AS A LEGAL LIABILITY.  BESIDES THIS, THE ISSUE IS CERTAINLY A CUSTOMER RELATIONS NIGHTMARE.  I ALONE HAVE VIEWED SEVERAL HUNDRED COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SAME ISSUE. CHEVROLET MUST ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY WITH A FULL REPLACEMENT OF PARTS AND COMPLETE WARRANTY.  *TR",

NOW THE BLOWER MOTOR AND HEATER DO NOT WORK UNLESS YOU POUND BY THE ASHTRAY AREA AND HOPEFULLY THE AIR CONDITIONING WILL START BLOWING BUT THE HEAT WILL NOT COME ON WHEN SWITCHED TO HEAT.

I AM UNHAPPY WITH MY CAR WHICH HAS STARTED PROBLEMS AROUND THE 30,000 MILE MARK. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE HIGH BEAM SWITCH IS NEEDING TO BE CLICKED TWICE BEFORE DIMMING DOWN FROM HIGH BEAM.

I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WAS ENOGH EVIDENCE TO WARRANT THE REPAIR TO MY VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR ANOTHER OIL CHANGE AND WAIT 2000 MILES.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IF OIL IS BEING CONSUMED IT HAS TO EFFECT OTHER PARTS OF THE ENGINE.  THE OIL HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE.  AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD NOT CAUSE ANY EFFECT TO ANY OTHER PART OF THE VEHICLE.  *AK",
