It became almost impossible to perform any quick/reactionary steering changes.  I put on my hazards and drove to the dealership and then for a second opinion with my local trusted mechanic.  Both advised the electronic steering assembly went bad, that there is a new part #, indicative of a high failure rate; however, the part is not available in all of North America (they checked.) they called GM Buick and were advised an ETA on the backorder for the part is unknown.  They filed for an emergency backorder request and are awaiting further information.  Now, I have an undriveable vehicle, there are no loaner cars available, the cheapest rental car is a full car payment every three days, and no idea how long before the vehicle will be able to be repaired as it is too dangerous to drive in its current state.  I think this needs to be investigated, as this issue sounds like it should be a recall before someone gets killed.",
