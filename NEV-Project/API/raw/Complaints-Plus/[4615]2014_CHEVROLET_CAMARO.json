I REACHED OUT TO GM LETTING THEM KNOW THAT I WAS HAVING ISSUES WITH MY STEREO. THE SPEAKERS ARE ALSO AFFECTED WHEN THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.. THE CAR WILL TURN ON AND I WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING THROUGH THE STEREO, LIKE THE RADIO, A CD, AN AUX CORD AND EVEN SIRIUS XM BUT RANDOMLY THE STEREO HAS A LOUD NOISE THAT SCREETCHES THROUGH THE SPEAKERS WHICH CAUSE A GREAT AMOUNT OF DISCOMFORT. THEN THE STEREO RESETS AND IS ONLY ABLE TO BE USED VIA AUX AT A LOWER VOLUME AMD EVEN WAY DIFFERENT SOUND QUALITY. ITS VERY STRANGE AND REALLY INCONVIENENT WHILE DRIVING, A FEW TIMES IT SCARED ME SO ABRUPTLY THAT I ALMOST WRECKED DUE TO AN ANXIETY ATTACK. ITS A WELL KNOW ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL FROM YEARS 2011-2015 IF YOU GOOGLE \"CAMARO STEREO PROBLEMS\" YOU WILL SEE A FEW DIFFERENT WEB FORUMS COMPARING ISSIES WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE BEING BROUGHT UO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. GM INFORMED ME THAT THE ONLY WAY OF GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PROBLEM IS TO TAKE IT IN TO GET A DIAGNOSTICS DONE WHICH IS OUT OF MY PRICE RANGE AT THE MOMENT DUE TO COVID. BUT ANYWAYS ALL THAT SHOULD BE PUT TO THE SIDE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO BEING A SAFETY CONCERN. THANKS IN ADVANCE. I KNOW ALOT OF PPL WOULD LOVE TO ENJOY A NORMAL DRIVE WITHOUT BEING STARTLED BY A LOUD GUITAR AMP POPPING NOISE. I MISS GOOD DRIVES WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC WITH GOOD QUALITY.",

ON JULY 29TH 2018 I WAS DRIVING 60-65 ON FREEWAY IN MEDIUM TRAFFIC AND GAS PEDAL LEFT MY FOOT AND WENT TO THE FLOOR. STUCK. I AM BEATING IT WITH MY FOOT TRYING TO GET IT TO RELEASE. I WENT UP TO SPEEDS OF 120+. 3-3/12 MILES IT RELEASED BEFORE I HAD TO DO EVASIVE MEASURES. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING CAMAROS TRANS AMS AND CORVETTES SINCE 1975. NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN. UPON INSPECTION THE UNDER THE DRIVERS DASH IS FULL OF RUST. NOT SURFACE RUST. OLD HEAVY RUST. I HAVE A 97 CAMARO IN THE DRIVEWAY THAT HAS NONE OF WHAT THIS 2014 HAS. DID OR DOES THAT THROTTLE SYSTEM HAVE WATER DAMAGED WIRING? I HAVE HAD RADIO REPLACED AND DRIVERS SIDE SEAT MOTOR REPLACED. IS THIS A FLOOD VEHICLE? IT'S NOT ON THE HISTORY BUT DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING ANYMORE? I'VE BEEN TOLD BY FOUR MECHANICS IT'S UNDRIVABLE, UNSAFE. WHAT DID HAPPEN TO THIS CAR?",

WHILE I WAS IN A 55 MPH ZONE, I DECIDED TO AGAIN PULL OFF THE ROAD AND CONTACT ONSTAR.  MY VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER.  THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON, THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED ME SAYING THE PROBLEM WAS A BAD HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP.  THE DEALER HAD A SPARE FUEL PUMP IN-STOCK, HOWEVER THE FUEL LINE IS NON-SERVICEABLE, AND I WAS TOLD THEY WERE ON A BACK-ORDER OF 3-5 DAYS.  SEVEN DAYS LATER THE DEALER CALLED TO LET ME KNOW THAT GM WAS RE-ENGINEERING THAT FUEL LINE AND IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF A MONTH BEFORE THE CAR WOULD BE REPAIRED.  AFTER A TOTAL OF 17 DAYS, THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE BACK IN ORDER.  *TR",

LUCKILY NO ACCIDENT, HOWEVER IT IS UTTER NONSENSE TO SELL AN AUTOMOBILE IN THE NORTHEAST WITH SUMMER TIRES ONLY AND THEN OFFER ALL WEATHER TIRES AND RIMS AS A $1000.00 AFTER MARKET OPTION. I FEEL THIS IS NOT ONLY UNSAFE BUT LETHAL TO THE DRIVER AND ALL OCCUPANTS. I BELIEVE THAT CHEVY SHOULD BE SELLING THE CAR WITH ALL WEATHER TIRES (SAFETY FIRST) AND THE SUMMER TIRES AS AN OPTION. I FEEL THAT PAYING $45,000.00 FOR A VEHICLE IT SHOULD BE SAFE. I FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE MANY ACCIDENTS TO COME AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW \"DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE\" TO GET THIS INVESTIGATED. I FEEL CHEVY SHOULD RECALL ALL AUTOS WITH THESE SUMMER TIRES AND REPLACE THEM WITH ALL WEATHER OR AT LEAST HAVE THE OWNER SIGH A WAIVER.  *TR",
