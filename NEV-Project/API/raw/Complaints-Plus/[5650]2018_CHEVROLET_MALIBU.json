The tow truck to it to a chevy dealer and the next morning they called asking for details as the car started right up and they drove it around for 10 minutes without issue.  They kept the vehicle all day but were unable to recreate the problem so they told me there was nothing they could do.  They pulled 17 codes and said that's too many to diagnose so nothing to do.  I drove 15 miles home with no issues.  The next day I went to get the oil changed and they tested the 12V battery and told me it failed.  I went to buy a battery and drove home.  The next day I drove around 10 miles and then it dies again as I was slowing down to a stoplight.  I pushed it to a parking lot and installed the new battery.  I took the old battery back to the store to get my core deposit back and asked them to test it.  They said it tested fine but I went ahead and gave it to them as I already had the new battery installed and it's a pain in the rear to do.  On the 3 mile trip home they car jerked/slipped shifting briefly and the check engine light came on.  OnStar sent me a notification the first time telling me the battery was drained and I needed to charge it.  The second time I received a notification that there was an issue with the \"electronic drivetrain\" and needed to take it in for service.  I'm taking it to the dealer I purchased it from tomorrow to see if they can figure it out.",

Do you know how unsafe that made me feel especially having a 5 year old and 2 year (when it happen in the last they where obviously 3 and a new born) but it was scary. The check engine light comes on and off. And TODAY MY CAR did what it do a here and there it shut off\u2026 and then on a BUSY road WOULD NOT GO. I had to sit and wait until my family could help push my 2 year old car off the busy road with my 2 babies in the car. It was horrible. Im paying so much for a car I CONSISTENTLY have issues with. Im scared to drive my own car. Now im being told my car needs a new battery, a weird part is needing to be replaced. I have had the same issues taken it to the shop and told everything is good. Oil changes kept up etc. everyone I know that has a Malibu has issues with their Malibu\u2019s",

This will be my 3rd time taking my vehicle in for this same issue. i've read up on this and did my research this has been going on since 2016-2018 Malibu vehicles.  I've reached out to GM asked about recalls, they said there is none. I asked how do i file a complaint so this doesn't happen to others. they told me i have to make a complaint with the dealership(that right there told me that calling GM customer support directly they are not willing to help with this safety issue. that is so sad too. what is happening to this world, the kindness and compassion for your customers and quality of items you purchase.

I have noticed when this happens all programmed radio stations are deleted but the programmed stations return once the car has been turned off for a while and started again. I also noticed a message regarding steering assist, but I cannot get the entire message because it is only there for a second or so.   In other instances which began around October 28, when trying to start the vehicle the message reads battery low start vehicle. I then try to start the vehicle a number of times before it actually starts. When it does start the message reads battery saver active. There have also been a message service stabilitrak.  The engine light does come on from time to time and then goes off.  I brought the vehicle in to a Chevy Dealership (Banner Chevrolet in New Orleans) and was told that a service technician would not be able to look at it and diagnose the problem for at least 3 weeks because of the backlog regarding COVID-19.

I BELIEVE THAT THE TERM \"NEUTRAL SAFETY SWITCH,\" HAS BEEN REPLACED BY GENERAL MOTORS IN ORDER TO AVOID USING THE WORD SAFETY.  RATHER, THEY USE TERMS LIKE \"BCM,\" AND \"SHIFTER ASSEMBLY,\" TO CIRCUMVENT CRITICISM OF A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM.    AS THE AVERAGE MILEAGE APPEARS TO BE JUST SHORT OF THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION, GM IS LEAVING A SIZABLE REPAIR BILL TO CONSUMERS THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY IT, AND FORCING \"BACK YARD WORK AROUNDS\" TO THOSE WHO CAN NOT.    I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE NHTSA LOOK FURTHER INTO THE ISSUE, AS WELL AS THE SEMANTICS EMPLOYED BY GENERAL MOTORS.

I JUST DIDN'T SEE EITHER OF THOSE PARTS BEING THE REASON FOR THAT MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON THE CAR, AND LUCKILY I REMEMBERED THAT GM TRUCKS WERE HAVING A MAJOR ISSUE LOSING BRAKES DUE TO THE VACUUM PUMP. SO AFTER AN INSPECTION I FELT PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WAS MY BRAND NEW MALIBU'S PROBLEM, SO I WENT TO THE PARTS COUNTER AND DROPPED $330 ON MY WARRANTIED MALIBU, AND SURE ENOUGH THE CAR WAS FINE AFTER THAT!

AFTER THE FIRST TWO DAYS, THE CAR SEEMED TO WORK FINE. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS COOLER AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS - NOT SURE.
