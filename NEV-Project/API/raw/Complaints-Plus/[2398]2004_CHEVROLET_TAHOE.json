I CALLED THE DEALER FROM WHO WE HAD BOUGHT THE TAHOE AND ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS TO THIS.  THEY SAID NO.  I SHOULD ALSO TELL YOU THAT THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT HE HAD REPLACED MANY OF THIS SAME TANKS.  HE SAID IT WAS BUILT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BE SHAPED LIKE A BOWL AND THAT THE WATER JUST LAID IN IT.  IT COST ME 750.00 TO GET A NEW FUEL SENDING UNIT PUT IN.  ABOUT 4 YEARS LATER, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED.  THE ENTIRE TOP OF THE PUMP WAS RUSTED OUT AND AGAIN GAS LEAKED OUT .  ENOUGH GAS LEAKED OUT TO ALMOST COVER MY ENTIRE GARAGE FLOOR.  THIS REALLY KIND OF SCARED ME.  EVEN JUST ANY KINK OF A SMALL SPARK  AND NOT ONLY ME BUT MY HOLE HOUSE WITH FIVE OTHER PEOPLE NOT MIGHT OF GOT HURT, WITH THIS MUCH GAS WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD..  AGAIN I CHECKED FOR RECALLS OF WHICH THERE WERE NONE AND ENDED HAVING AGAIN A NEW FUEL PUMP INSTALLED.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT  HE.  *TR",

SINCE THAT DATE I HAVE NEEDED TO ADD ADDITIONAL OIL IN BETWEEN OIL CHANGES.  IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IT STARTED TO USE A LOT OF COOLANT.  I HAVE ADDED ABOUT 4 GALLONS OF COOLANT IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE LEFT CYLINDER HEAD WAS LEAKING COOLANT IN THE ENGINE.  AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THE CASTECH HEADS IN THIS MODEL WERE POROUS WHICH CAUSED THEM TO CRACK. THE DEALER IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE ENGINE BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $6400.  I FEEL CHEVY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS REPAIR SINCE THEY ARE AWARE THAT THE PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH THE CASTECH HEADS.  *TR",

I WENT TO MY MECHANIC AND HAD HIM CHECK IT OUT.  HE CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THAT THE GASOLINE RIGHT WHERE THEY EXITED THE FUEL TANK WERE BADLY RUSTED AND  THATS WHERE THE GAS WAS COMING FROM.  HE BROUGHT ME INTO HIS SHOP AND WITH THE CAR UP IN THE AIR, HE WAS ABLE TO SHOW ME USING 2 MIRRORS BECAUSE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO SEE BY LOOKING UP AS TO HOW BADLY THE 3 LINES HAD RUSTED.  AT THIS TIME THE CAR ONLY HAD ABOUT 12000 MILES ON IT.  HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT WHERE THE FUEL LINES CAME OUT OF THE TANK THAT IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A BOWL AND THAT EVEN IF I WAS JUST WASHING IT, THERE WOULD STILL BE A FAIRLY LARGE PUDDLE OF WATER THERE.  THIS CAR WAS MY PRIDE AND JOY.  I NEVER DROVE IT IN WET WEATHER AND I NEVER DROVE IT DURING THE WINTER.

AFTER CHECKING LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP, SERVICE PERSON SAID THAT SINCE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THE EXPENSE WOULD BE BETWEEN 500 TO 600 DOLLARS AND TAKE THREE TO FOUR DAYS TO REPAIR. THIS SEEMED DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE, SO I PHONED ANOTHER GM DEALERSHIP, AND THEY SAID THAT THE REPAIR WOULD BE BETWEEN 400 TO 500 DOLLARS. THAT PARTICULAR DEALERSHIP SAID THEY COULD HAVE THE PART ORDERED AND AT THEIR LOCATION WITHIN 24 HOURS, AND IT WOULD ONLY TAKE AN HOUR TO INSTALL.  I PHONED LOCAL PARTS STORES AND THEN BECAME AWARE TO THE HOST OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO GM SPEEDOMETERS BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2003 AND 2004, AND THEY SAID THE ONLY PLACE TO PURCHASE THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER WAS THROUGH A GM DEALERSHIP, OR SALVAGE YARD.  I COMPLETELY WROTE OFF THE SALVAGE YARD, AS HOW COULD I BE CERTAIN THAT THE SALVAGED PART WOULD NOT LIKEWISE BECOME UNRELIABLE.  AS ANOTHER RESOURCE, I CHECKED THE INTERNET, AND TO MY SURPRISE, THERE WAS ROW AFTER ROW, AFTER ROW, OF CONSUMERS WHOSE GM PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO MINE HAD EXPERIENCED THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM WITH THEIR SPEEDOMETERS.  AFTER READING SO MANY TESTIMONIALS OF DISAPPOINTED DRIVERS WHO WERE LIKE ME, THROWN INTO THE UNCERTAINTY OF HOW FAST OR SLOW THEY WERE GOING, I FELT COMPELLED TO WRITE TO YOU.  EVERYONE IN OUR FAMILY IS AT RISK WHEN WE DRIVE OR RIDE IN THIS AUTOMOBILE, AND THE DEALERS' DISCREPANCY IN THE APPROACH TO REPAIR THE SPEEDOMETER LEAVES ME WANTING TO TRY ANOTHER REPUTABLE REPAIR SERVICE.  I PHONED TWO OTHER GM DEALERSHIPS, TODAY, BUT THEY WERE CLOSED ON SATURDAY.  THIS CERTAINLY MUST BE A PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE BECOME AWARE OF OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, AND I WOULD MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ADVICE IN THE DIRECTION I SHOULD GO FROM HERE.  MY SINCEREST GRATITUDE.
