IT ALSO LOCKED UP THE STEERING WHEEL AND BRAKING SYSTEM SO I HAD NEXT TO NO POWER. IT WAS INCREDIBLY SCARY. I AM JUST GLAD THAT I WAS DRIVING THE CAR, INSTEAD OF MY ELDERLY MOTHER. SHE VERY WELL MAY HAVE HAD A HEART ATTACK FROM THE FEAR. IN NO WAY SHOULD A CAR JUST SHUT DOWN MID-DRIVE LIKE THAT! I CANT EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN THE AMOUNT OF WAYS HOW BADLY THAT COULD GO WRONG, AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE WITH CHEVY VEHICLES AND THE THROTTLE BODY. EVEN IF THE THROTTLE BODY IS GOING BAD, IN NO WAY SHOULD YOUR CAR BE PROGRAMED TO JUST SHUT OFF MID-DRIVE, EVER. I REALLY HOPE THAT IS A PROGRAMING FLAW AND NOT INTENTIONAL, BECAUSE IF THAT IS INTENTIONAL, YOU ARE TRULY TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR CHEVY/GM TO GET THE ISSUE FIXED? HOW MANY PEOPLE GETTING KILLED IN UNNECESSARY ACCIDENTS IS IT GOING TO TAKE? I PRAY THAT MYSELF OR MY FAMILY ISN'T ONE OF THEM! PLEASE CHEVY/GM, GET THIS ISSUE FIXED ALREADY.",

I EVENTUALLY HAD IT TOWED TO MY HOME AND AFTER READING ONLINE TODAY AT FORUMS.EDMONDS.COM MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS ISSUE WITH IMPALA'S AND SUBURBAN'S FROM GM FOR AT LEAST 4 YEARS NOW, FIRST POST IS BACK IN 2012. GM NEEDS TO PUT A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES AND FIX THE ISSUE BEFORE IT MORE FATALITIES, AS PROVEN IN THEIR EARLIER 2014-2015 RECALL. THEY JUST DID A RECALL ABOUT A YEAR AGO FOR IMPALA'S HAVING AN ISSUE WHERE THE IGNITION SWITCH WOULD THEN SWITCH INTO THE OFF POSITION WHILE DRIVING IF YOU HIT A BUMP TOO HARD AND HAD TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON YOUR KEYS. I GOT MY VEHICLE SERVICED FOR THAT RECALL ISSUE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR FIX FOR THAT WAS INCORRECT AND NOT THE ISSUE SEEING AS MY VEHICLE, AND SEVERAL OTHERS, STILL SHUTS DOWN WHILE DRIVING AND THE IGNITION IS STILL IN THE ON (NOT OFF) POSITION, YOU LOSE ACCELERATION AND STEERING. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND WILL CAUSE MORE DEATHS, INJURIES, AND ACCIDENTS. PLEASE GET THIS TO GM AND HAVE THEM CORRECT THIS ISSUE IN ALL THEIR MODELS WITH SENSOR THROTTLE BODY'S INSTEAD OF WIRED ONES.

SHE STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT AND AS SHE WAS PREPARING TO ACCELERATE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND  A WARNING MESSAGE FLASHED STATING (ENGINE POWER REDUCED). MY DAUGHTER STATED THAT THE CAR WOULD ONLY GET UP TO 40 MPH AND RPM GAUGE WOULD NOT GO PASS 2, EVEN WHEN SHE PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL DOWN TO THE FLOOR.  SHE HAD TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR 10 MILES IN FEAR THAT THE CAR WAS GOING TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY STREET WHILE IN TRANSIT. SHE FINALLY MADE IT HOME. HOWEVER, THE CAR SPEED REMAINED AT 40 MPH; DESPITE HER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE THE SPEED. AFTER 2 HOURS HAD PASSED, I STARTED THE CAR-THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS OFF AND WHEN I DROVE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE FASTER THAN 40 MPH.  AFTER DRIVING AROUND THE BLOCK, THE CHECK ENGINE CAME BACK ON. I CONTACTED ONSTAR FOR AN ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC- THE RESULT WAS THAT THE POWERTRAIN SYSTEM HAS FAILED- A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL SYSTEM.   AFTER I RECEIVED THAT MESSAGE, I CHECKED ON LINE FOR A RECALL- I DISCOVERED SEVERAL SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH 2008 CHEVROLET IMPALAS- ONLY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED VEHICLES WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS WERE RECALLED. WHY??? THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE/CONCERN/PROBLEM. WILL IT TAKE MULTIPLE TRAGIC CAR ACCIDENTS BEFORE A RECALL FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM?   MY CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 128,000 MILES- AND IN THE COMPLAINTS, I NOTICED A COMPLAINT THAT HAD THE SAME MILEAGE DOCUMENTED.  I'M TERRIFIED TO DRIVE MY CAR FOR ANY DISTANT AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE REPAIR. I RECENTLY HAD A TUNE-UP AT SERRA CHEVROLET IN MADISON, TN (OCT. 2015)THAT COST ME OVER $600.00. SUPPOSEDLY, THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM  WAS SERVICED. I WONDERING WHY I HAVE THIS PROBLEM.   I STRONGLY FEEL THAT GM NEEDS TO RECALL THIS MODEL VEHICLE ALONG WITH THE 2008 MALIBU FOR THIS PROBLEM.",

OUR REAR TIRES ARE WEARING OUT TWICE AS FAST AS THE FRONT TIRES. I WENT TO COSTCO YESTERDAY TO HAVE MY TIRES ROTATED, AFTER LOOKING AT THE REAR TIRES WE HAD TO BUY NEW ONES BECAUSE THE BACK TIRES WERE WORN DOWN TO  THE METAL BACKING, THE FRONT TIRES WERE STILL GOOD.  ONLY ONE HALF OF THE WARRANTY HAD BEEN USED. THE TIRES WERE MICHELIN X-RADIAL DT MICH PASSENGER  S/T P225/60R16  BW MSPN 17457  TIRES WITH AN 80,000 MILE WARRANTY.  WE ENDED UP BUYING FOUR NEW MICHELIN TIRES FOR AROUND $600.00. THE COSTCO GUY THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG WITH THE CAR.  AFTER I GOT HOME I CHECKED ON THE INTERNET AS TO WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE 2007 AND 2008 CHEVROLET IMPALA'S. THERE HAD BEEN A SERVICE BULLETIN #08032A SENT OUT IN 2011 TO REPLACE THE SPINDLE RODS ON ALL THE 2007 AND 2008 IMPALA'S THAT WERE SOLD AS POLICE CARS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE HAVING WITH REAR TIRE WEAR.

WE HAD JUST FINISHED A TRIP WERE WE DROVE FREEWAY SPEEDS UP TO 75 MILES AN HOUR. AFTER SEEING OUR TIRES I DON'T KNOW HOW WE KEEP FROM HAVING A BLOW OUT ON THE BACK TIRES.   I THINK THAT LOTS OF ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED WITH THESE 2007 AND 2008 CHEVY IMPALAS WITH TIRES BLOWING OUT BECAUSE REAR TIRE  WEAR BECAUSE THE SPINDLE BOLTS ARE ENGINEERED WRONG   AND EVERY ONE THINKS ITS THE TIRES FAULT..

THE LETTER ALSO STATES THAT IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR IT WOULD AFFECT MY POWER STEERING, BREAKING AND AIR BAGS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT IN THE RUN POSITION RESULTING IN HIGH RISK OF CRASH INCREASING THE RISK OF INJURY OR FATALITY. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION, I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS OF THE LETTER AND REMOVED ANYTHING THAT ADDED EXTRA WEIGHT TO MY KEY AND CALLED GM IMMEDIATELY. I WAS TOLD BY A GM REP TO CONTACT MY LOCAL DEALER TO SEE WHEN PARTS WILL ARRIVE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WHICH STILL TO THIS DAY THEY HAVE NOT. UPON DOING FURTHER RESEARCH I COME TO FIND OUT THAT DUE TO THIS ISSUE THERE HAS BEEN MULTIPLE CRASHES EVEN SOME FATALITY'S!!, NOW I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE SEEING AS HOW GM DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT EVEN WHEN ONLY USING THE IGNITION KEY WITHOUT ADDED WEIGHT THAT THE IGNITION WONT BE JARRED TO SWITCH TO THE OFF POSITION.

I WAS TOLD IT WAS A COMMON AND WELL KNOWN ISSUE WITH CHEVROLET IMPALA MODELS.  AFTER CONTACTING GM THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SORRY AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT. I'M STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT TRICKS THIS CAR DOES NEXT.  I NOW BELIEVE IT IS POORLY MADE AND I WILL NEVER OWN  ANOTHER ONE..  GM CANT EVEN MAKE A CUP HOLDER ROUND LIKE A CUP. SORRY I DIDN'T SEE THAT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT OR MIGHT HAVE AN ENGINEERING CLUE.  ALSO BOTH MY DOOR LOCKS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE CONSECUTIVELY STOPPED WORKING AND ITS NOT THE FUSES.  THERE'S 200 BUCKS TO FIX THAT I DON'T HAVE AND I HAVE TO SHIFT MY CAR BY USING A SCREWDRIVER AND PUSHING THE SILVER BUTTON UNDER THE CONSOLE WHICH RELEASES THE SHIFTER. THANK GOD CHEVY HAD BACK UP FOR THAT ENGINEERING MISTAKE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THAT ONE EITHER.  NOW I'M JUST GUESSING IF MY CAR SHOULD BE ON RECALL.

A SIMILAR INCIDENT HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS LATER AS I WAS HEADING EASTBOUND ON SNELL ROAD BETWEEN MT. VERNON AND ROCHESTER ROAD.  WHEN THE GM IGNITION RECALLS STARTED, I DID NOT CORRELATE THESE INCIDENTS WITH THE RECALL. HOWEVER, WHEN I READ A NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT RECENTLY OF A GM EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SITUATION WITH HER 2006 IMPALA, I REALIZED IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN IGNITION ISSUE AS WELL.

LAST MONTH, MAY, 2014, AND THIS MONTH, JUNE, 2014, THERE WAS A SUDDEN REDUCED POWER ALERT ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE SPEED IMMEDIATELY DROPPED TO NO MORE THAN 35 MPH.  BEFORE I COULD GET IT TO ADVANCE TO HAVE THEM CHECK TO SEE IF ANY CODES HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE COMPUTER, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF.  THERE WAS NO REDUCED POWER MESSAGE EITHER, AND THE SPEED RETURNED TO NORMAL.  I WAS TOLD TO TRY FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER, WHICH I DID.  ALL WENT WELL FOR ALMOST A MONTH, WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN THIS MONTH.  THIS TIME I WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO ADVANCE WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STILL ON.  THE COMPUTER HAD DROPPED 2 CODES, BOTH RELATED TO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR.  ADVANCE DID NOT HAVE THE PART, NOR DID AUTOZONE.  FORTUNATELY, NAPA DID, FOR $90, INCLUDING TAX.  OUR LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP WANTED $50 MORE.  SINCE IT IS A VERY EASY PART TO REPLACE EVEN FOR AN AMATEUR LIKE ME, I REPLACED IT.  THERE ARE ONLY 2 10 MM BOLTS TO REMOVE AND AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO UNPLUG.  SO IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE, AND SO FAR, THIS HAS DONE THE TRICK, BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN 24 HOURS.  THIS APPARENTLY IS A JOB THAT THE DEALERSHIPS WANT TO CHARGE $300 TO $400 TO DO.  AS I SAID, THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM FOR GM, AND THEY HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT, SO FAR, DO A RECALL.  THEY SHOULD.  I'M ONLY OUT $90 SO FAR, BUT OTHER PEOPLE ARE OUT MUCH MORE.  IF I HAVE THE DREADED, FOLLOW-UP PROBLEM WITH THE  THROTTLE BODY, I WILL BE OUT A WHOLE LOT MORE.  I SENT AN E-MAIL TO CHEVROLET AFTER THE FIRST INSTANCE, AND DID GET A RESPONSE BACK.  I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY FURTHER ACTION UNLESS THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.

NO HELP, SAME MESSAGE. I LET THE CAR SIT. WHEN IT FIRST STARTED UP, STILL HAD THE MESSAGE. BUT ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER, THE CAR STARTED NORMALLY!!! THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON NOW, BUT THOSE CODES HAVEN'T BEEN ACCURATE SO FAR. WHILE THE CAR WAS RUNNING NORMALLY, I WENT OUT AND JIGGLED ALL THE WIRING BOTH UNDER THE DASH AND ABOVE THE THROTTLE, BUT COULD NOT FIND A LOOSE WIRE OR GET THE CAR TO SHIFT INTO THE \"ENGINE POWER REDUCED\" MESSAGE. I ALSO TAPPED ON AND JIGGLED THE AIR BOX (BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT'S WHERE THE ECM IS LOCATED). STILL COULDN'T GET IT TO GO BAD. CAME BACK OUT THE NEXT TIME AND THE CAR HAD THE \"ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED\" MESSAGE AND RUNNING HORRIBLY. I WAS FORTUNATE NOT TO BE KILLED, THESE CARS ARE MOVING CHICANES. I AM TOTALLY AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON. GM SERVICE REPS SAY \"GO TO THE DEALER\" BUT ONLINE SHOWS THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A BUNCH OF EXPENSIVE REPLACED PARTS THAT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.

AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH ONLINE I DISCOVERS THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH CHEVY IMPALAS HAVE REPORTED AND COMPLAINED OUT THE SAME ISSUE THAT IT CAN POSSIBLY BE A SENSOR IN THE GAS PEDAL WHICH APPARENTLY ISN'T COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND ITS COSTLY CONSUMERS HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO CORRECT. THIS VEHICLE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AS IT IS A SAFETY THREAT.  *TR",

EVEN STARTING FROM A STOP LIGHT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET YOUR SPEED UP VERY FAST. THERE WERE A FEW TIMES WHERE THE CAR LOST TOTAL POWER AND I HAD TO COAST OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AFTER LETTING THE CAR SIT FOR A FEW MINUTES, IT STARTED AGAIN BUT STILL HAD THE ENGINE ICON LIT AND HE SAME MESSAGE APPEARED. I DID HAVE A PART REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE OF $200+ AND FOR A VERY SHORT TIME IT DID FIX THE PROBLEM BUT THEN VERY SHORTLY IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN. I WAS LAID OFF MY JOB SO WAS NOT DOING THE ROUTE SALES ANY LONGER AND WAS USING THE CAR JUST FOR PERSONAL RUNNING SO DIDN'T PAY TO MUCH ATTENTION TO GETTING IT LOOKED AT AND MY WIFE HAD HER CAR TO USE FOR TRIPS. IT RECENTLY HAS BEEN TO WHERE THE LIGHT AND MESSAGE WILL NOT GO OFF AND IT IS CONSTANTLY IN THE REDUCED POWER MADE. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND DUE TO THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THIS MUST BE TAKEN CARE OF. I DID TAKE IT TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP THIS WEEK TO SEE IF I HAD MISSED A RECALL. THE MECHANIC WAS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND SAID THERE WAS A RECALL FOR TRUCKS NOT CARS AND HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT. NOR DO WE. NOW IF YOU KNOW THIS IS A POTENTIAL AND IS VERY COMMON ON THESE CARS AS WE ARE TOLD, THEN IT NEEDS FIXED NOW. FIXING THIS, SINCE YOU KNOW THE SEVERITY AND POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WOULD SURE BE BETTER THAN A LAWSUIT I WOULD THINK. I AWAIT YOUR TIMELY RESPONSE. I WILL KICK THIS UP HIGHER BUT WANTED TO START HERE.

AFTER THE FIRST WEEK, THE POWER STEERING SEEMED TO BE FAILING, ESPECIALLY DURING RAIN.      TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE INCIDENT.  THEY TOLD US THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND TO BRING IT BACK IF THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG AND WE WERE BACK AT THE DEALER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  DEALER SAID THEY CHECKED THE BELTS AND THE FLUID ALL WORKING PROPERLY.  AFTER A FEW OTHER TIMES OF THE POWER STEERING FAILING TOOK THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALER AND THEY TOO COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PS.  SO, AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS BACK TO DEALER WE DECIDED TO JUST DEAL WITH IT.      WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT COMPLAINT ABOUT THE 2008 IMPALA, AT JUST OVER 10,000 NOTED ABNORMAL WEAR ON TIRES, AND WIRES PEEKING THROUGH ON THE INSIDE.  TOOK IT IN TO DEALER AND THEY ACCUSED US OF ABUSIVE DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND NEGLECT, WHICH WAS A NEW ON TO ME.  ANYWAY, THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRES SITTING THE WARRANTY ONLY COVERS DEFECTS AND NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.  SO, BY THIS TIME WE ARE STARTING TO REGRET THE PURCHASE OF THIS VEHICLE.  WE HAD TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES @ 98.00 EACH.  ABOUT YEAR LATER AT 28,000 MILES BEGAN TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AGAIN.  AFTER MANY HOURS OF DEBATES AND PHONE CALLS THEY AGREE TO \"CHECK OUT OUR PROBLEM\" WITH NO COST TO US.  LOW AND BEHOLD WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND ADVISED US TO PURCHASE BETTER BRAND TIRES.  THE LAST TIME I LOOKED MICHELIN WAS A TOP BRAND TIRE.

THIS SENSOR AFFECTS THE CARS DRIVABILITY AND CAUSES LIMITED SPEED IN THE VEHICLE. I LOOKED ON GOOGLE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SAME ISSUE. I GUESS NO ONE HAS REPORTED IT BUT IT SEEMS VERY COMMON AMONGST CHEVROLET IMPALA MODEL CARS 2006 AND UP.     THIS IS THE EMAIL LINK WITH SEVERAL OTHER CONCERNS REGARDING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR:   HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F215E7E      I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY SEAT BELT. THE DRIVER??S SIDE SEAT BELT WILL NOT FASTEN WITHOUT ME HOLDING THE LATCH DOWN. THIS ISSUE STARTED AROUND AUGUST 2012 AND IS A REAL SAFETY CONCERN OF MINE. I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT BECAUSE IT FASTENED. BUT KNOWING I HAVE TO HOLD THE LATCH DOWN IN ORDER FOR IT TO CLICK INDICATES A DEFECT AND EVENTUALLY IT MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE ISSUES AND IF NECESSARY WARRANT A RECALL BECAUSE SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN FOR CONSUMERS AND IF I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING A GM VEHICLE IT WILL BE MY FIRST AND LAST TIME PURCHASING ONE.  *TR",

I DID NOT DO THIS BECAUSE I COULD NOT BELIEVE A BRAND NEW CAR AT 3000 MILES NEEDED A TIRE ROTATION.  I WAS ALSO STARTING TO NOTICE THAT THE BACK END WAS SLIDING AND FELT LIKE IT WAS \"ROLLING\", ESPECIALLY IN ICE AND SNOW.  I WAS ADVISED AT MY SECOND OIL CHANGE (6000 MILES) THAT MY TIRES WERE ALMOST \"SHOT\" AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THIS WAS BECAUSE I HAD FAILED TO ROTATE MY TIRES.  A FRIEND WHO IS A MASTER MECHANIC FELT THAT I NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT ON THE CAR.  HE TOLD ME TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND HAVE EVERYTHING REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.  IN MAY OF 2009, AT APPROXIMATE 6K-7K MILES, I TOOK THE CAR TO ART MOEHN.  THEY ADVISED THAT I VOIDED MY TIRE WARRANTY BY NOT HAVING MY TIRES ROTATED. A MONTH LATER I HAD A BLOWOUT ON ONE OF MY TIRES.  I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED, AND HAD AN ALIGNMENT DONE ON THE CAR.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I HAD A NEW SET OF TIRES PUT ON.  IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS, THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  BY 2011 AT ABOUT 50K MILES, I WAS ON MY THIRD SET OF TIRES AND HAD HAD MY CAR ALIGNED TWO TIMES.  WE THEN FOUND OUT THAT GM HAD ISSUES WITH SOME OF THESE 2008 IMPALAS - WITH VERY SIMILAR STORIES OF WHAT I HAD BEEN THRU. I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ASK FOR HELP WITH THIS CAR - REQUESTING THEY FIX THE PROBLEM.  THEY INSISTED I HAVE YET ANOTHER ALIGNMENT AND ASSESSMENT \"AT MY COST\" AT THEIR SPECIFIED DEALER.  IMAGINE MY FRUSTRATION WHEN THIS ALIGNMENT (LESS THAN 3 MOS FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE) YIELDED RESULTS THAT THE CAR WAS ALREADY OUT OF ALIGNMENT!!!  GM OFFERED ME A $1000 GIFT CERT TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF ANOTHER NEW GM VEHICLE.  PLEASE HELP.  THIS CAR IS A SAFETY HAZARD & NEEDS TO BE FIXED.",

THEY SOLD AT AUCTION AND SENT ME TO A COLLECTION AGENCY FOR THE BALANCE OF $9700. THE CAR RESOLD TO AN UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMER IN NH. GM IS STILL TRYING TO COLLECT THE BALANCE AND HAS OFFERED A COMPROMISE $4800. THESE VEHICLES HAVE KILLED UNSUSPECTING CONSUMERS BUT DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT EXIST?? I AM SURE IF A STUDY WAS DONE ON ALL HIGHWAY /ACCIDENTS/DEATHS CONNECTED TO 2007 & 2008 IMPALAS, REAR TIRE WEAR WOULD BE WELL REPRESENTED.  GM SHOULD SMELL THE COFFEE AND RECALL THESE DANGEROUS VEHICLES. IT APPEARS TO BE A SPECIFIC FRAME RUN AND NOT EVERY CHEVY AND BUICK FRAME MANUFACTURERS IN THOSE YEARS. ALL POLICE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN RECALLED AND RETROFITTED TO CORRECT THE REAR ALIGNMENT ISSUE  PLEASE HELP PROTECT AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND FORCE GM TO MAKE THIS PROBLEM RIGHT!  *TR",

ON 2/6/2010 I HAD A TIRE BLOW OUT IN BAINBRIDGE, GEORGIA NEARLY CAUSING A CRASH.  AFTER CHANGING MY TIRE, AND RETURNING HOME I DISCOVERED THAT BOTH REAR TIRES WERE WORN DOWN TO THE BELT ON THE INSIDE.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE IN THE LATE MODEL IMPALA'S.  I CALLED THE SHOP TODAY (2/8/2010), AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THIS ISSUE.  I ALSO CALLED SOLOMON CHEVROLET IN DOTHAN, ALABAMA (1-866-646-6175).  THEY ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE, AND THAT IT NEEDED A REAR CAMBER BOLT KIT AND A REALIGNMENT TO FIX THIS ISSUE.  THE PARTS AND LABOR FOR THE KIT WERE ESTIMATED @ $200.00 AND THE ALIGNMENT @ $70.00. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT MY CAR IS STILL UNDER THE 12,000 MILE CERTIFIED WARRANTY.  MY CAR HAD 34,861 MILE ON IT WHEN I PURCHASED IT, AND NOW IT ONLY HAS 45,690 MILES ON IT. SO I HAVE PUT A TOTAL OF 10,829 MILES ON IT.  THE TIRES THAT ARE ON MY CAR WERE BRAND NEW WHEN I PURCHASED IT.  THERE IS NO WAY POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACING 2 WORN OUT TIRES WITHIN 10,829 MILES'. THIS IS UNHEARD OF'  *TR",

THIS DID NOT CHANGE THE ISSUE, SO WENT TO GOODYEAR DEALER AND FOUND OUT THAT THE INSIDE 2 INCHES OF ALL FOUR TIRES WERE WEARING EXCESSIVELY WITH THE REAR TWO LESS THAT 2/32 INCHES OF TREAD LEFT. GOODYEAR SHOT THE ALIGNMENT AND SHOWED THAT THE ALIGNMENT WAS WAY OFF AND TIRES COULD NOT BE WARRANTED WITH AN ALIGNMENT ISSUE. TOOK BACK TO CHEVY DEALER TO INFORM THEM OF THE ALIGNMENT ISSUE. THEY SAID ALIGNMENT WAS NOT WARRANTED AFTER 7,500 MILES AND ALSO WOULD NOT REPLACE THE 4 TIRES. I DID GET THE DEALER TO GRATUITOUSLY DO A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT THAT ALSO SHOWED THE CAMBER AND TOE, ESPECIALLY IN THE REAR WAS \"OUT OF TOLERANCE AND EXCEEDED CROSS-TOLERANCE\" ON THEIR MACHINE AS WELL. THE CAMBER COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT EXTRA WORK (ELONGATING THE BOLT HOLES OR A CHAMBER ALIGNMENT KIT). CONTACTED GM COMPLAINT LINE FOR RESOLUTION TO NO AVAIL, SAYING I HAD TO PROVE THAT THERE IS A DEFECT ON THE VEHICLE. THIS IS AN INHERENT SAFETY PROBLEM WITH 2007 AND 2008 IMPALAS THAT HAS FOSTERED NUMEROUS COMPLAINT TO YOU INCLUDING 5 ALREADY THIS YEAR. GM ISSUED A TSB #08032 FOR POLICE IMPALAS THAT ARE ON THE SAME PLATFORM AND SUSPENSION, BUT NEVER EXTENDED THAT TO THE PUBLIC.
