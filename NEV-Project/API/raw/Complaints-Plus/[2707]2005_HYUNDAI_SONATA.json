I WAS EXITING A GAS STATION AFTER FILLING UP. AS I REACHED THE MAIN STREET AND WAS PULLING OUT ONTO THE ROAD, MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF AND BEGAN ROLLING INTO THE BUSY ROAD. I TURNED IT OFF, THEN ON AND IT BEGAN RUNNING AGAIN. THIS HAPPENED 5 MORE TIMES OVER THE SPAN OF 1YR 4 MOS, EACH TIME ONLY AFTER I PUT GAS IN MY CAR. IT HAS NOW PROGRESSED TO NOT STARTING AT ALL AFTER I PUT GAS IN MY CAR. RECENTLY, I FILLED UP MY CAR AND WHEN FINISHED , IT WOULD NOT START. I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES, GIVING THE CAR BREAKS IN-BETWEEN AND IT EITHER TURNED ON THEN SPUTTERED AND DIED OR DIDN'T TURN ON AT ALL. IT TOOK 30MINS FOR ME TO START MY CAR BUT I WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO LEAVE THE GAS STATION. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND I DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR HYUNDAI SONATAS OF THE SAME YEAR (AND EVEN SOME OTHER MODELS/YEARS). THE NEXT TIME, I DIDN'T FILL UP ALL THE WAY BUT PUT IN 1/4 TANK OF GAS. ONCE AGAIN, MY CAR DID NOT START FOR AROUND 25 MINUTES.

ONLY ONE REAR BRAKE MALFUNCTIONED IN THIS WAY, HOWEVER ALL ROTORS HAD TO BE \"TURNED DOWN\" AND NEW BRAKES WERE INSTALLED ALL AROUND EVEN THOUGH ALL OTHER 3 PADS WERE LIKE NEW.  AT 72,000 THE FRONT BRAKE DID THE EXACT SAME THING AND THE REAR BRAKE WAS CLOSE TO BEING DETRIMENTAL TO THE ROTOR.  THE FRONT ROTORS COULD NOT BE \"TURNED-DOWN\" AGAIN, SO NEW ROTORS WERE APPLIED.  THIS PARTICULAR MECHANIC, AT A WELL KNOW FACILITY INFORMED ME THAT HYUNDAI'S ARE NOTORIOUS FOR WEARING OUT BRAKES AND THEY SEE THIS CONTINUED PROBLEM.  THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THE HYUNDAI DEALER IS QUITE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE.  I AM NOW ON A \"WATCH\" AT THIS MECHANIC'S SHOP TO KEEP FROM HAVING YET ANOTHER BRAKE ISSUE.  SOMETHING CAUSES THE BRAKES TO DRAG AND WEAR QUICKLY AND NOT ALWAYS THE SAME BRAKE.  THE BRAKE PEDDLE, AFTER THE FIRST HYUNDAI SERVICE, WENT TO FLOOR AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE SONATA IS DESIGNED FOR THE \"OLDER\" CUSTOMER WHOSE REACTION TIME IS SLOWER AND MORE UNSTEADY, THEREFORE THE BRAKING IS LONGER AND SOFTER.  AFTER THE NEW MECHANIC ADJUSTED EVERYTHING, MY BRAKES ARE NORMAL.  *TR",

AS  SHE PROCEEDED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION ON A GREEN LIGHT, A LATE MODEL FORD  RANGER TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE INTERSECTION CROSSING HER PATH.  AS SHE ADVANCED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION SHE STRUCK THE FORD RANGER BROAD SIDE. FORTUNATELY FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE HAD HER SEAT BELT ON, BECAUSE THE 2005 HYUNDAI SONATA'S AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE HYUNDAI 'S AIR BAGS NOT DEPLOYING  BECAUSE THE IMPACT WAS  STRAIGHT AHEAD  HIT, UNLESS THE HYUNDAI 'S AIR BAG  WERE DEFECTIVE. MY DAUGHTER  WAS NOT HURT BAD, ALTHOUGH SHE HAS BEEN HAVING NECK & BACK PAIN AND IS UNDER A DOCTOR'S SUPERVISION.  I HAVE WRITTEN TO HYUNDAI.,  TO THIS DATE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY UNRESPONSIVE.

INITIALLY, I WAS TOLD THAT ALL OF THIS WAS NORMAL - HOWEVER I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY OF THIS WHEN I RENTED THE SAME TYPE OF CAR LAST YEAR.  THEN I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A LOOSE ENGINE MOUNT.  I THEN HAD TWO EXPERIENCES WITHIN ONE WEEK WHERE THE CAR DID NOT START - LIGHTS, RADIO, A/C STILL CAME ON - BUT THE CAR DID NOT START.  I HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE FIRST TIME, THEY CHANGED A RELAY AND THE SECOND TIME, AFTER KEEPING THE CAR FOR ONE WEEK THEY CHANGED THE ENTIRE FUSE BOX.

I PULLED A CAR HISTORY REPORT THAT REVEALED THAT THE CAR FAILED EMISSIONS, HAD A LEFT DOOR REPLACED, AND HAD A STARTER ASSEMBLY REPLACED.
