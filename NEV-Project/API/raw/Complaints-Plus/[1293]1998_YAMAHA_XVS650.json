I KNOW DOZENS OF OTHER OWNERS OF THIS BIKE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE INFERIOR TRANSMISSION. THIS IS A HAZARD BECAUSE MY BIKE CAN SLIP OUT OF GEAR WHILE  ACCELERATING ONTO THE FREEWAY, WHICH WILL CAUSE ME TO SLOW DOWN AND BE HIT FROM BEHIND BY ANOTHER MOTORIST. THIS IS NOT A ISOLATED PROBLEM. I HAVE MET MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THIS MODEL ON THE INTERNET WHO ALSO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ON THEIR BIKES. PLEASE HELP US ALL BY RECALLING THIS BIKE TO MAKE YAMAHA FIX THE FLAWED TRANSMISSION. THANK YOU.*AK",
