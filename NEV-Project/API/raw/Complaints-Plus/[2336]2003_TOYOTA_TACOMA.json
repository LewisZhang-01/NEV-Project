Fortunately only the passenger side came loose, keeping the truck's bed attached to the rear of the truck   I later found that this particular model has a problem with Frame rot which generated a Toyota bulletin.  I bought the truck from Toyota, as a used truck in 2011, but received no notifications of this potentially hazardous vehicle.  If the bed had come loose at highway speed, any vehicle following the 2003 Toyota Tacoma truck would have been severely damaged or potentially resulted in the death of the people in the cars following behind me and the truck.  There was a Toyota bulletin issued previously which was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase.  The vehicle has been in Toyota shops regularly for inspections, maintenance and other repairs but the shop never mentioned anything about a \"rusty\" frame.  Upon further research, I have found multiple Toyota Tacoma owners with similar issues with the frame.  I believe Toyota knowingly manufactured and sold a defective product with serious potential safety issues.  This vehicle either should be banned from the road for the safety of all drivers.",

FEELING DISTRAUGHT, I GO ONLINE AND LOOKUP RECALLS FOR MY CAR WHICH LED ME TO THE \"FRAME RUST\" SAFETY ISSUE ON A MANY TOYOTA MODELS TO INCLUDE MY OWN.  THE ADVISEMENT SUGGESTS SAFETY CONCERNS WITH THE FRAME RUSTING THROUGH DUE TO FACTORY NEGLIGENCE IN SUFFICIENTLY COATING WITH ANTI-CORROSION MATERIALS.  FURTHER RESEARCH IN OTHER FORUMS STATE OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS DESCRIBING IT AS FRAME RUST ALTOGETHER AND NOT JUST ON THE SPARE TIRE PLATE.  ISSUES DESCRIBED INCLUDE THE ISSUE CAUSING THE LEAF SPRING TO SNAP AND THE FRAME ITSELF RUSTING THROUGH.  INSPECTION OF MY TRUCK PROVES TRUE TO ALL ACCOUNTS DESCRIBED. I CONTACTED SERVCO TOYOTA IN HONOLULU, HI THE VERY NEXT DAY AND SPOKE TO A NICE LADY.  I EXPLAINED HOW I BECAME THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE SINCE 2015 AND WAS NEVER MADE AWARE OF THIS RECALL.  SHE CHECKED MY VIN TO CONFIRM THAT I WAS AFFECTED BY IT, HOWEVER THE RECALL HAS EXPIRED AS OF 2018 SO THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.

WE PERFORMED ALL RECALLS THEY ISSUED.  AFTER AN ONLINE SEARCH, WE DISCOVERED THE EXTENT OF THIS FRAME ROT PROBLEM OVER MANY TOYOTA TRUCKS.  WHEN WE CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE, THEY DISMISSED US AND TOLD US THAT WE WERE OUT OF LUCK RECEIVING ANY HELP OR COMPENSATION FOR THIS DEFECT BECAUSE WE HAD MISSED DEADLINES ON A CLASS ACTION SUIT AND ALSO THAT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ISSUED ONLY FOR SOME TACOMAS IN CERTAIN COLD WEATHER STATES. WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF ANY OF THIS INFORMATION AND HAVE LIVED AT THIS SAME ADDRESS WITH THE SAME CONTACT INFORMATION SINCE THE TIME OF PURCHASE. WE WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED IT AND THEY ALSO COMPLETELY DISMISSED US, TELLING US THAT IT WAS OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND WE COULD TRY TO CONTACT CORPORATE TO JOIN ALL THE OTHER TRUCK OWNERS WITH THIS FRAME ROT PROBLEM AND TRY TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HELP US.

THE REP I SPOKE TO SAID THAT IT WAS INDEED IN THE RECALL AND THAT, AFTER I PURCHASE I SHOULD TAKE TO LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND IF THE FRAME HAS PERFORATION THEN THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FRAME.

THEY SAID THE FRAME INDEED HAD PERFORATION AND WAS ELIGIBLE FOR FRAME REPLACEMENT.  I LEFT THE TRUCK THERE, BUT THEY CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND SAID THEY WERE SORRY BUT UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THEY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE 2003 TACOMA WAS A \"NORTHERN TRUCK\" AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY \"UNDERCOATED\" AND WAS THEREFORE EXEMPT FROM THE RECALL THAT WOULD FIX THE FRAME.  I CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE AND UPON FURTHER CHECKING, THEY SAID THAT IF THE 2003 TACOMA HAD BEEN UNDERCOATED BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER (AT NO COST TO OWNER--A SERVICE TOYOTA PROVIDED FOR FREE ONCE THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEY HAD USED BAD STEEL FOR THE FRAMES OF THESE TRUCKS) THEN IT WOULD BE COVERED IN RECALL.  I EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE TRUCK IS THEIR REP HADN'T TOLD ME THAT THE FRAME WOULD REPLACED.  THEY SAID THE REP HAD NOT LOOKED FAR ENOUGH INTO THE MATTER AND HAD TOLD ME WRONG AND THAT I WAS BASICALLY STUCK WITH A TRUCK I COULD NOT DRIVE.  I PAID $6500 FOR THIS TRUCK AND I CANNOT PUT $12,000 INTO IT TO FIX THE FRAME.  AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO!  TOYOTA NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR USING BAD STEEL FOR THESE TRUCKS.

I'VE RECEIVED AT LEAST THREE LETTERS FROM TOYOTA FOR THE SPARE TIRE HOLDER RUST ISSUE, SO THEY DO KNOW I OWN THE TRUCK AND HOW TO CONTACT ME.  I'VE LIVED AT THE SAME LOCATION FOR 14 YEARS!  FROM WHAT I'VE READ, THE CORROSION TREATMENT THEY ALLEGEDLY OFFERED DIDN'T HELP ANYWAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE WERE NOTIFIED AND OTHER WERE NOT.

I CONTACTED TOYOTA IN MAY 2014 TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT.  TOYOTA INFORMED ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS RECALLED FOR A DEFECTIVE FRAME BUT THE RECALL HAD EXPIRED. I INFORMED TOYOTA THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE A RECALL FROM THEM AND REQUESTED THEM TO MAKE GOOD ON THE RECALL AND REPLACE MY FRAME. THEY AGAIN REFUSED MY REQUEST.    ON MAY 22, 2014 I TOOK MY TACOMA TO MOTOR WORLD TOYOTA FOR A FRAME INSPECTION. THE INSPECTION FOUND PERFORATION ON THE LEFT REAR FRAME BY THE LEAF SPRING. THE INSPECTION ALSO STATED DUE TO FRAME PERFORATION THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THE MECHANIC THAT EXAMINED OUR TRUCK STATED THAT THEY WERE REPLACING FRAMES ON A LARGE AMOUNT OF TOYOTA VEHICLES DUE TO THE FRAME DEFECT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE WOULD REPORT HIS FINDINGS TO TOYOTA AND CONTACT US. A FEW DAYS LATER THE MANAGER CONTACTED US ONLY TO INFORM US AGAIN CORPORATE TOYOTA AGAIN REFUSED TO REPLACE THE FRAME.    IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR I AGAIN CONTACT CORPORATE TOYOTA(CASE#1503280111) BY PHONE AND EMAIL TO REQUEST THEM TO HONOR THE RECALL FOR THE DEFECTIVE FRAME ONLY TO BE REFUSED AGAIN.     I AM ASKING FOR ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN OFFER US. IT IS CRITICAL TO OUR FAMILY FOR TOYOTA TO HONOR THE RECALL ON THE FRAME OUR TRUCK.  MY HUSBAND USES THE VEHICLE TO TRAVEL TO FREQUENT MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. HE HAS BEEN TREATED SINCE APRIL 2012 FOR METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.

I FELT LIKE I HAD GOTTEN LUCKY TO GET A NICE DEPENDABLE TRK ON THE ROAD. WITHIN A MONTH I NOTICED THE TRK WAS RIDING ROUGHER. IT SEEMED TO BE GETTING WORSE EVERYDAY. TACOMA DOESN'T HAVE GOOD SUSPENSION IN THE 1ST PLACE AS I HAD TO DO IT TWICE ON MY LAST TRK. THE TRK HAD SNOW BUILD UP FROM THE COLD WINTER WE WERE HAVING, SO I TOOK IT TO THE CAR WASH TO CLEAN IT UP BEFORE PUTTING `IT IN THE SHOP. WHILE WASHING IT I NOTICED SOME SCALE RUST CAME OFF UNDER THE DRIVERS FLOOR, I PULLED IT INTO THE SHOP OVER THE HOIST & WHILE SETTING THE LIFT ARMS I NOTICED A SUBSTANTIAL HOLE IN MY FRAME. I LIFTED THE TRK TO FIND A PIECE OF THE FRAME STARTING AT THE LT FRONT SWAY BAR MOUNT HAD ROTTED AROUND THE WELDED SEAM & DISINTEGRATED.  THE HOLE WAS15\" LONG & ANOTHER 8\" HOLE ON THE RT REAR IN FRT OF THE SPRING SHACKLE.

I DID NOT OWN THE TRK UNTIL 2014. TOYOTA IS TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND A TECHNICALITY THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE NEW OWNER. I FEEL TOYOTA SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXCESSIVE RUST ISSUE AS THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE HAD TO RE-CALL OVER 160.000 UNITS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THEY FAILED TO USE ADEQUATE RUST PROTECTION IN THE 1ST PLACE. THIS TRK & MANY OTHER TOYOTA TRKS ON THE ROAD ARE A POTENTIAL DEATH TRAP. THE WORLD NEEDS TO BE INFORMED OF TOYOTA NOT BACKING THEIR WARR. & TRYING TO KEEP THE HUSH HUSH ON THEIR RECALL FOR RUST PERFORATION.

ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT ABOUT 45 THE TRUCK JUST LOST POWER AND STALLED ON ME.  I WAS ALMOST NOT ABLE TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD AND OF COURSE THE PERSON BEHIND ME ALMOST REAR ENDED ME AND WAS HIGHLY AGITATED I HAD STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND APPEARED TO BE DRIVING LIKE A TEENAGER LEARING TO DRIVE A MANUAL SHIFT TRANSMISSION.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER I WAS TOLD IT WAS A BAD MAF SENSOR WHICH WAS REPLACED ALONG WITH OTHER ITEMS WHICH COST $400.  THIS DID NOT FIX IT AND AFTER MUCH TRIAL AND ERROR AND RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY AND ONE OF IT'S SENSORS THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED.  WHEN I MENTIONED THIS TO TOYOTA, THEY DISAGREED AND SAID THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  IT IS FUNNY HOW MANY COMPLAINTS ARE HERE AND HOW MANY MORE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT HERE.  MY LOCAL TOYOTA SPECIALIST (NOT THE DEALERSHIP), WHO I TRUST AND HAS SPENT A WEEK WITH MY TRUCK DRIVING IT AND TESTING IT AND STILL ONLY CHARGED ME $80, HAS ALSO CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM, A BAD SENSOR AND THE ONLY FIX IS TO COMPLETELY REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY AT A COST OF ABOUT $1,000 OR SO DEPENDING ON AVAILABLITY OF PARTS.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE 2003 AND 2004 MODELS ONLY AND HAVE HEARD CLAIMS FROM TOYOTA MECHANICS \"OFF THE RECORD\" THAT TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.  IT HAS COME TO THE POINT THAT I DON'T LET ANYONE IN MY FAMILY DRIVE THIS TRUCK BUT ME, IT IS TOO DANGEROUS.  MY KIDS DON'T RIDE IN IT WITH ME EITHER BECAUSE IT COULD STALL AS I AM TRYING TO CROSS TRAFFIC AND THE RESULTS COULD BE DEADLY.  PLEASE, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY BECAUSE I CAN'T WAIT TO FIX THIS, BUT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE YOU CAN SAVE OTHERS THE MONEY AND POSSIBLY THEIR FAMILES LIVES!  *TT",

THE RESPONSE WAS \"IT PROBABLY DIDN'T LOOK THAT BAD A YEAR AGO\"....!!!   I CALLED THE TOYOTA 800 PHONE NUMBER AND OPENED A CASE.  AS A RESULT,  I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS PART WAS RECALLED ON THE 2003 TUNDRA, BUT NOT THE TACOMA... TOYOTA WILL HOWEVER REIMBURSE ME THE COST $233 IF I WISH TO HAVE THE PIECE REPLACED.

WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN I HAD TO BUY 2 NEW TIRES BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE TIRES HAD TEARS OR CUTS 1 1/2 - 3 INCHES LONG THAT WERE VISIBLE ONLY AFTER THE RIM WAS REMOVED.  THESE TIRES HAD AROUND 40,000 MILES ON THEM.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER I PURCHASED THE ORIGINAL TIRES FROM AND I AM IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING OUT A RESOLUTION WITH THEM.  THE 4TH TIRE HAS A \"RIPPLE\" IN IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TIRE, NOT AROUND THE RIM, AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME THAT  IS FROM SEPARATION AND IS NOT UNUSUAL.

THE FRAME IS LITERALLY RUSTING FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  WHAT HAPPENS IS, AS THE FRAME RUSTS ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOXED SECTION, THE RUST FLAKES DROP ONTO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOXED SECTION.  THESE RUST FLAKES THEN PLUG THE WEEP HOLES IN THE FRAME SO THAT MOISTURE IS NOT ALLOWED TO DRAIN OUT THE INTERIOR OF THE BOXED SECTION, THEREBY EXACERBATING THE POTENTIAL FOR CORROSION.  SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE BOTTOM OF THE BOXED SECTION OF FRAME IS RUSTING OUT DUE TO THE BUILD-UP OF MOISTURE AND THE ACCUMULATION OF RUST FLAKES PLUGGING OFF THE WEEP HOLES.  THE RUST FLAKES ARE 1/8? DEEP ON THE BOTTOM OF MY BOXED SECTION OF FRAME.  BASICALLY THE BOTTOM 20% OF TACOMA FRAMES ARE RUSTING OUT.    WHAT IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOXED SECTION OF FRAME BECOMING COMPROMISED BY CORROSION, IS THE BOTTOM OF THE BOXED SECTION IS WHERE THE BRACKET FOR THE REAR LEAF SPRING IS ATTACHED.  AS THE BOXED SECTION CORRODES, THERE IS LESS AND LESS MATERIAL SUPPORTING THIS MAJOR SUSPENSION BRACKET.  THE DESIGN OF THIS BRACKET MUST BE ANALYZED BY YOUR NHTSA INDEPENDENT ENGINEER.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IT DOESN?T TAKE MUCH FRAME CORROSION TO SEVERELY COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THIS WELDED LEAF SPRING BRACKET.  IF THIS BRACKET FAILS, THEN THE FRONT OF THE LEAF SPRING COMES FREE, THE REAR AXLE COMES OUT OF ALIGNMENT, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE OPERATOR TO LOSE CONTROL.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE!  I ALSO CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER THAT SINCE THE FRAME IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE VEHICLE'S SAFETY SYSTEM, WHAT DOES A SEVERELY CORRODED AND WEAKENED FRAME DO TO THE LEVEL OF CRASH PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE VEHICLE?  IF NHTSA?S INDEPENDENT ENGINEER FINDS THAT THE FRAME DOES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE CRASH PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE VEHICLE, THEN THE NHTSA WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FORCE TOYOTA TO DO A RECALL. *TR",

THE ACCELERATOR PETAL POSITION SENSOR ASSEMBLY HAS A SHAFT ONTO WHICH THE LEVER FOR THE ACCELERATOR CABLE IS MOUNTED WITH SOME RETURN SPRINGS. THIS SHAFT ALSO TURNS THE POTENTIOMETER.

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE POTENTIOMETER CAN ALSO TURN IN THE ASSEMBLY, LOOSING ITS REFERENCE TO THE ARM AND LEVER. THEN THE RANGE OF RESISTANCE THAT IS POSSIBLE CAN BE CHANGED. IF IT TURNS TOO FAR ONE WAY, THE HIGHER RESISTANCE WILL BE SUCH THAT THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT VOLTAGE SENT TO THE ECU TO INDICATE THAT THE PEDAL HAS BEEN DEPRESSED.
