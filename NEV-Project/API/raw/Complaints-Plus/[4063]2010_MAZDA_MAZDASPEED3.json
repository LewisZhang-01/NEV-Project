THE PART BROKE RIGHT WHERE THE COLOR FADES FROM BLUE/GRAY TO THE ORGINAL BRONZE COLOR.  A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALS THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM.  I HAVE INCLUDED SEVERAL LINKS WITH OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE.  ONE DRIVER MENTIONS ALMOST COLLIDING WITH A WALL WHEN IT BROKE.    I HAVE SPOKEN TO BOTH MAZDA AND MY LOCAL DEALER.  BOTH REFUSE TO COVER THE REPAIR COSTS. MAZDA DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE AS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  THE DEALER REPAIR WOULD BE AN OUT OF POCKET COST OF ~$1000.  I WAS QUOTED 2.5 HOURS LABOR AND A PARTS COST OF $700 FOR THE SEAT AND FRAME.    THE RESPONSES I RECEIVED FROM MAZDA AND THE DEALER WERE DISHEARTENING.  OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT A POTENTIAL $1000 REPAIR BILL TO FIX THE SEAT, AND THE BROKEN BRACKET AND WOBBLY SEAT REPRESENT A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK.
