        "summary": "The sunroof glass broke broke away while I was in the interstate going 70 miles a hour.  It was so scary.  Thank God there wasn't anyone behind me at the time.  This could have went thru a cars windshield behind me and killed them.  They need to build these better or be illegal in the US.  I am putting a claim in with my insurance co. I don't know if it's covered.  The garage that will be repairing mine said he gets many calls of this happening.  Even though it's may not be a vehicle defect like breaks but it surly is a hazard issue. Even the insurance girl I was talking to said one almost hit her.  She was lucky she was going up on the side of the vehicle that lost it and not behind it.  This has not been a recall and something should be done about sunroofs. Extra brackets to hold them in maybe should be applied on any vehicle with a sunroof. I'm telling you it scared me to death when it broke. My heart was pounding and it could of caused me to panic and get in an accident.  I had to drive with one hand holding my inside sliding cover.  And if it had been pouring rain I would of had water pouring in and that would be an electrical issue.  Please don't let this issue continue.  Please have every vehicle with a sunroof recalled and have extra brackets added.  Can you imagine if you was driving on the highway and a sunroof came flying at you.  It would be worse than the ice on vehicles that is illegal.  Never did I ever expect this to happen.  I would pray this would come under highway safety.   They are so dangerous.   I will never purchase another vehicle with one again.  I am waiting on the insurance co.",

THE DEALERSHIP AGREED THAT THIS WAS A DEFECTIVE ISSUE THROUGH OUT A NUMBER OF OTHER GM MODELS.  THE DEALERSHIP AGREED TO REPLACE THE DASHBOARD AT NO CHARGE.  THIS WEEK ON 9 DECEMBER 2013 I NOTICED ANOTHER CRACK IN THE NEW DASHBOARD. JUST SLIGHTLY OVER A YEAR THIS HAS HAPPENED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME IN A NEW LOCATION.  THIS CRACK IS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE NEAR THE FRONT OF THE WINDSHIELD NEAR THE VIN NUMBER PLATE TO THE BASE OF THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER.  THIS CRACK IN THE PAST TWO DAYS IS OPENING MORE AND MORE EVERYDAY.  ON 10 DECEMBER THE CRACK HAS NOW FORMED A \"V\" SHAPE AND HAS SPLIT TO TOWARDS THE DRIVERS DOOR.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TODAY AND THE DEALERSHIP, THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT REPLACED THE DASHBOARD THE FIRST TIME, SAID NO AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER HELP ME AND RECOMMENDED TO ME THAT I JUST GET A \"COVER\" TO NOT SEE IT AND BOTHER ME.  I PAID NEARLY $40,000 FOR THE TRUCK AND KEEP VERY GOOD CARE OF IT.  I FEEL THAT THESE CRACKS ARE A SAFETY CONCERN THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND FIXED.  THE DEALERSHIPS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AND THEY WILL NO LONGER HELP. OTHER OWNERS LIKE ME ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE AND WE NEED HELP TO GET OUR VEHICLES FIXED.

IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED ON SEVERAL WEB SITE THREW OUT THE INTERNET. I EVEN FOUND SOME INFO ON SERVICE NOTICES POSTED BY GM TO DEALERS. IF GM KNOWS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A NATIONAL RECALL? I WAS INVOLVED IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT AND DID NOT HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF THE SAFETY DEVICES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO SAVE MY LIFE  I PAID FOR THAT ADDED SAFETY IN THE HIGH PURCHASE PRICE OF MY TRUCK.

THE END OF DEC I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE INTERMITTENT WIPER/FLUID PROBLEM AND I THOUGHT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING.  THEY COULDN'T FIND AN ISSUE WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND THEIR DIAGNOSIS FOR THE WIPER UNIT WAS THAT THE MODULE WAS BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THEY REFERRED TO BULLETIN #4298, DATED 02/26/07, AND PART #1910885.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT ALL THE FAILED SENSORS/PARTS ARE RELATED TO THE RECALL AND I AM HOPING THE INVESTIGATION TO THE RECALL IS STILL OPEN/ON-GOING.  FYI:  WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF PURCHASING THE VEHICLE MY BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AFTER BEING INSPECTED AT THE DEALERSHIP.  IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THERE WERE SEVERAL OCCASIONS I WAS UNABLE TO START THE VEHICLE.  THERE SHOULD BE RECORDS ON FILE AT THE DEALERSHIP PERTAINING TO THIS ISSUE.  LASTLY, I DO HAVE THE PART THAT WAS REPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE OIL PRESSURE SENSOR. *TR",
