AFTER RECEIVING MY KEYS BACK I COULD HARDLY GET THE KEY TO ROTATE THE IGNITION LOCK, I HAD TO JIGGLE THE KEY QUITE VIGOROUSLY TO GET THE IGNITION TO OPERATE. FOUR DAYS LATER THE KEY FELL OUT OF THE IGNITION AND THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN WHILE I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40 MPH. ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT TO STEER AND BRAKE I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY BRING THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, LOCATE THE KEY ON THE FLOOR AND AFTER REINSERTING THE KEY RESTARTED HE CAR. I HAD A ROLL OF TAPE IN THE GLOVE BOX AND I USED IT TO TAPE THE KEY IN POSITION. NO FURTHER DIFFICULTIES. ON APRIL 27, 2015 I REPLACED THE LOCK CORE SUCCESSFULLY. THE RECALL FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR SAFE. I KNEW THE IGNITION LOCK WAS GETTING BAD BUT WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE ENGINE WOULD SHUT DOWN IF THE KEY FELL OUT. THIS FIX GAVE ME A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THAT A PROBLEM WAS TAKEN CARE OF. WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER I THOUGHT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE LOCK CORE AND KEYS AND NOT JUST GLUE A HOUSING ONTO MY WORN-OUT KEYS. MY REPLACEMENT OF THE LOCK CORE SOLVED THE PROBLEM THE WAY  THE DEALER SHOULD HAVE. A LETTER NEEDS TO GO OUT TO ALL THAT RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER THAT THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIX IF THE LOCK CORE IS NOT REPLACED.

MY VEHICLE WAS HEADED WEST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE DONEGAL EXIT AND THE NEW STANTON EXIT OF THE TURNPIKE. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE WHAT I CONSIDER IDEAL DRIVING CONDITIONS. I WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE OF THE TWO LANE ROADWAY AND AS I WAS APPROACHING A MODERATE CURVE IN THE ROADWAY MY VEHICLE PULLED SEVERELY TO THE LEFT, I ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE BY USING THE STEERING WHEEL AND MODERATE PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES. NO AMOUNT OF CONTROL I TRIED TO EXERT WAS OF ANY VALUE AND WITHIN SECONDS MY VEHICLE HAD STRUCK THE JERSEY BARRIER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND SPUN INTO A POSITION AGAINST THE RIGHT JERSEY BARRIER FACING TRAFFIC. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD HERE THAT I HAD OWNED AND DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND APPROACHING 75,000 MILES, I WAS COMPLETELY ACCUSTOMED TO MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THIS VEHICLE EVEN WHILE DRIVING UNDER THE WORST OF CONDITIONS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.

THE DRIVER IS UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL ANOTHER DRIVER ON THE ROAD BRINGS IT TO THEIR ATTENTION.

THE DEALER WANTS $170 FOR THE PART AND CHARGE 2 HOURS LABOR AT $90/HOUR FOR A WHOPPING COST OF $350 + TAX AND ONLY OFFER A 12-MONTH WARRANTY FOR THEIR PARTS/LABOR. TO ME, THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION THAT GM FAILS TO RECOGNIZE BY RECALLING OR SIMPLY REPAIRING FREE OF CHARGE. APPARENTLY, GM SAYS THE LEFT/RIGHT BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH IS WIRED THROUGH THE MULTI-FUNCTION/TURN SIGNAL SWITCH SO THE CRUISE CONTROL WILL CANCEL ONCE THE BRAKE PEDAL IS PRESSED, BUT THAT FEATURE STILL WORKS EVEN THOUGH THE BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T ILLUMINATE! OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS' CRUISE CONTROL SWITCHES OFF WHEN THE BRAKE IS PRESSED, YET THEY DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE MULTI-FUNCTION/TURN SIGNAL SWITCH FAILING INTERNALLY CAUSING THE LEFT/RIGHT BRAKE LIGHT TO NOT ILLUMINATE. PLEASE DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO GET GM TO REPLACE THIS POORLY DESIGNED SWITCH, FREE OF CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER.

WE DID NOT REALIZE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE SEATBELTS UNTIL NOW BECAUSE WE HAD NOT INSTALLED A CARSEAT UNTIL THE BIRTH OF OUR DAUGHTER THIS SUMMER.  I CANNOT PROPERLY SECURE OUR CHILD'S CARSEAT WHEN THE SHOULDER BELTS DO NOT LOCK.  I CANNOT GET THE SHOULDER BELT TO LOCK, SO I CANNOT INSTALL THE CARSEAT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL GARAGE AND WAS TOLD THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL ON SOME OF THE MODELS FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM, BUT I DON'T SEE THERE'S ONE FOR OUR MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR.  I AM CONTACTING THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP MONDAY MORNING TO GET THE BELTS REPAIRED/REPLACED.  *TR",

THE POLICY COVERS TURN SIGNAL/HAZARD FLASHER FAILURE FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES (WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST) TO PROVIDE A NO COST REPLACEMENT OF THE HAZARD SWITCH. GM WILL SEND LETTERS TO OWNERS STARTING DECEMBER 30, 2004. THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE MANUFACTURER IS SUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS INVESTIGATION.

I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL MY VEHICLE INTO A WENDY'S PARKING LOT, ALTHOUGH IT TOOK ALL OF MY STRENGTH TO STEER THE VEHICLE.    8/20/05 - I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP WHERE IT SAT FROM 8/20/05 TO 9/19/05 WAITING FOR A NEW ALTERNATOR BRACKET.  IT WAS THIS SHOP THAT DETERMINED IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR BRACKET THAT HAD BROKEN.    WEEKLY CALLS TO THE REPAIR SHOP WERE ANSWERED WITH, \"WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THE PART\".  A PHONE CALL TO THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT. REVEALED THAT THE INDEPENDENT SHOP HAD ORDERED THE ALTERNATOR BRACKET THROUGH THEM.  I WAS THEN TOLD THERE WERE NO ALTERNATOR BRACKETS FOR MY VEHICLE IN ALL OF KY OR TN AND THAT THERE WAS A NATIONAL BACKORDER ON THEM.    9/19/05 - I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP TO AWAIT AN ALTERNATOR BRACKET THINKING THAT IF THE DEALERSHIP HAD TO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE SITTING ON THEIR PROPERTY, THEY MIGHT BE MORE MOTIVATED TO GET IT REPAIRED.    9/20/05 - MY VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED WITH A SALVAGED ALTERNATOR BRACKET FROM ANOTHER MALIBU AND THE ALTERNATOR WAS REPLACED...NO MENTION ON MY REPAIR RECEIPT IF THE ALTERNATOR WAS NEW OR REBUILT.

I HAVE HAD MY CAR FOR JUST OVER A YEAR NOW AND I HAVE HAD 3 WHEELBEARINGS DONE, THE BRAKES CHANGED TWICE, THE ROTORS CHANGED AND TURNED, THE CALIPERS CHANGED AND MORE.  THE CALIPERS CONTINUE TO MAKE A HORRIBLE CRUNCHING NOISE AND NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.  THE DEALER SAYS ITS A MANUAFACTURING DEFECT AND CHEVY SAYS IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY WHEN I BOUGHT IT, 12 DAYS, AND IT WAS NEVER BROUGHT INTO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP SO THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  WELL, ITS CRAP AND I KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST A HUNDRED OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM SO IF YOU HAVE A 1999 CHEVY MALIBU WITH DEFECTS CALL ME AND LETS SUE IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.  607-397-1782",

REPLACED BRAKE PADS AND MACHINED ROTORS. THIS DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. 2ND DIAGNOSIS WAS AN INTERNAL LEAK IN POWER STEERING SYSTEM. THIS APPEARED TO HAVE FIXED PROBLEM. A FEW DAYS LATER I NOTICED A KNOCKING NOISE WHEN BRAKING. INFORMED DEALERSHIP BUT THE NOISE STOPPED DUE TO COLD WEATHER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK IF NOISE RESUMED. IT DID WHEN WEATHER GOT WARMER AND BRAKE PADS WERE ADJUSTED (35,000 MILES). RIGHT AWAY I NOTICED THE BRAKES DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. CAR SLOWED DOWN WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED BUT I HAD TO REALLY PRESS THE PEDAL DOWN TO GET IT TO STOP. ABOUT 1 WEEK LATER I HEARD KNOCKING AGAIN WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED LIGHTLY. THERE WAS ALSO A CREEKING NOISE FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL AND A SIGNIFICANT PULL TO THE RIGHT. KNOCKING NOISE GOT WORSE, BECAME A THUMPING NOISE. TOOK BACK TO DEALERSHIP. HAD TO MAKE APPOINTMENT. (THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO LISTEN TO THE NOISE!). THE DAY BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT NOISE GOT SO BAD I THOUGHT MY BRAKES WERE GOING TO FALL OFF. I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDANT MECHANIC AND HE DIAGNOSED THAT THE RIGHT ROTOR WAS WARPED (EXCESSIVE RUNOUT). TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ARMED WITH A PRINTOUT OF DIAGNOSIS FROM MECHANIC. ROTOR MACHINED AGAIN (36,000 MILES). I ASKED THE SERVICE REP WHAT COULD CAUSE THE ROTOR TO WARP AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW, IT COULD BE HOW I WAS DRIVING THE CAR! WHILE IT WAS IN THE SHOP I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT BRAKE PROBLEMS ARE VERY COMMON IN THIS MODEL AND YEAR AND THAT THE DEALERSHIPS ARE QUITE AWARE OF THIS. BRAKES STILL DON'T STOP THE CAR PROPERLY AND ARE NOW MAKING A SLIGHT GRATING NOISE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE IS NO INVESTIGATION OR RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM. SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY. I'VE HEARD THE GOVERNMENT CAN FORCE A RECALL IF THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS. WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN DONE? PLEASE ADVISE",

GRUDGEDLY THEY REPLACED MY ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS AGAIN. BUT THEY SAID THE NEXT TIME THEY WOULD CHARGE ME. \"AS THROUGH I WANTED THEM TO PUT DEFECTIVE ROTORS ON MY CAR.\" NOW ABOUT A YEAR LATE WITH AN ADDITIONAL 14,000 MILES MY ROTORS HAVE GIVEN OUT AGAIN.
