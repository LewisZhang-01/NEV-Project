I HAD IT TOWED TO THE BOB STALL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN LA MESA, CALIFORNIA.  THEY VERIFIED THAT THE MODULE WAS FRIED BUT THEY WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THE BRAKE SITUATION.  THEY JUST KEPT INSISTING THAT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THE BRAKES WORKED FINE WHEN THE CAR CAME IN.  THEY KEPT MY CAR FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND THEN FINALLY TOLD ME THAT THE PART THAT I NEEDED WAS NO LONGER MADE AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REPAIR MY CAR.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN AND NEITHER DOES ANYONE ELSE THAT I TALK TO, BUT I DO HAVE A WITNESS WHO DROVE THE CAR RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND WHO CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT I HAD NO BRAKES AT ALL.",

THIS FAILURE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND HAS HAPPENED TO MANY C5 CORVETTE OWNERS. IN FACT, GM EVEN HAS A POLICY KNOWN AS HE GOODWILL POLICY IN WHICH THEY WILL RANDOMLY OFFER DISCOUNTS TO CORVETTE OWNERS. SOME WILL RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT AND OTHERS WILL NOT. WHEN WE HAD THE CAR DIAGNOSED AT A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AS DIRECTED BY GM OFFICIALS WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WOULDN'T REPLACE THE PART DUE TO THE NUMBER OF MILES ON THE CAR. THIS PROBLEM HAD ORIGINALLY OCCURRED WHEN THE CAR HAD AROUND 30,000 MILES ON IT, APPEARING  TO BE AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM, AND THEN AFTER MONTHS OF DRIVING THE FAULTS WOULD NOT RESET. THE INDIVIDUALS AT GM  SAID  THAT THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM,  BUT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE PART ON CASE BY CASE BASIS. THE INDIVIDUAL AT GM CLAIMED  THAT HE CONTACTED THE TECHNICIAN AT JAMES WOODS AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PART FAILURE WAS NORMAL, AND THAT THE PART FAILED AT AROUND 60,000 MILES. THERE WERE  MANY FAILURES WITH LESS MILES THAN THAT. MY PROBLEM WASN'T THE FACT THAT THEY WOULDN'T OFFER ANY DISCOUNT, BUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT AFFECTED  THE SAFETY OF DRIVERS,  AND THEY WILL NOT ACT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. . I AM A FREQUENT POSTER ON THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE AND YOU COULD VERIFY THAT THERE WA S INDEED A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE EBCM. THE WEBSITE WAS CORVETTEFORUM.COM. IF YOU PERFORM D A SEARCH ON THE WEBSITE UNDER THE C5 SECTION YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE WERE  MANY CASES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM. I COULD  NOT GIVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF ANY ACCIDENTS OR DEATHS DUE TO THIS PROBLEM, BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE IMPACT WAS EXTREMELY HIGH OR THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO ABSENCE OF ABS WAS  EXTREMELY HIGH.  *AK",

AFTER THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED, THE STEERING COLUMN LOCKED UP WHILE I WAS BACKING THE VEHICLE OUT OF MY GARAGE TO PREPARE IT FOR WINTER STORAGE IN OCTOBER '05. PLEASE NOTE: THE ENGINE DID NOT SHUT OFF WHEN THE STEERING COLUMN LOCKED. I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER IN APRIL 2006 TO INVESTIGATE AFTER WHICH THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND RE-PERFORMED THE RECALL INITIATIVE. I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE UPON COMPLETION, IT WORKED FINE FOR TWO WEEKS. I THEN EXPERIENCED THE SERVICE STEERING COLUMN LOCK WARNING ON THE VEHICLE MONITORING SYSTEM ON 5/22/2006 WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, HOWEVER, THE STEERING COLUMN DID NOT LOCK UP. UPON LEAVING THAT DESTINATION ONCE AGAIN, THE STEERING LOCKED UP WHILE EXITING A PARKING LOT AND, ONCE AGAIN, THE ENGINE DID NOT SHUT OFF. I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO THE BATTERY BEING LOW BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS IN STORAGE FROM OCTOBER '05 TO APRIL '06. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SCENARIO IS 1) THE PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE VEHICLE BEING STORED IN OCTOBER, AND, 2) I REPLACED THE BATTERY IN AUGUST OF 2005 WITH A NEW ONE. AFTER HAVING MY VEHICLE FOR 9 DAYS, THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO AND TO COME GET THE CAR. WHEN I PICKED IT UP I WAS ADVISED THAT IF THE WARNING APPEARS AGAIN TO DISCONNECT THE POSITIVE BATTERY CABLE FROM THE BATTERY TO ENABLE THE SYSTEM TO RESET...TOTALLY IGNORING THE POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD OF THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKING UP AND WAS CHARGED FOR THEIR SERVICES.

THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK ISSUE IS SUBJECT TO A RECALL ISSUED BY GM/CHEVROLET (#04006A).  IN ADDITION TO THE RECALL, THE CAR IS ALSO COVERED UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BY GM.  THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED BY ANOTHER DEALER THIS SUMMER (LESS THAN 90 DAYS), AND CHEVROLET NOW REFUSES TO DIAGNOSE OR REPAIR THE CAR AT ITS EXPENSE, EVEN THOUGH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER STATED TWICE (2), INCLUDING IN A CONFERENCE CALL TO GM EXECUTIVE OFFICES, THAT THE RECALL HAD BEEN PERFORMED IMPROPERLY BY THE FIRST DEALER. HE FURTHER STATED THAT, HAD THIS RECALL BEEN PERFORMED PROPERLY, THE STEERING WOULD NOT HAVE LOCKED UP ON THE VEHICLE. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE LOCAL CHEVROLET ZONE MANAGER AS WELL. GM RECORDS ALL CUSTOMER CALLS AND THE RECORDED CALL IS ON RECORD. THIS WAS CONFIRMED.  CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE (REQUEST 1-361874832 CYNTHIA CAPPS 866-952-4368 X57879) HAS DENIED THE RECALL REPAIR, AS HAS GM EXTENDED WARRANTY, AND THE GM EXECUTIVE OFFICES, EVEN THOUGH THE FAILURE IS IDENTICAL, AND EXACTLY AS LISTED IN THE RECALL BULLETIN.  GM EXECUTIVE OFFICES AND CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE HAVE STATED THAT THE CUSTOMER MUST PAY FOR THE RECALL REPAIRS ON HIS OWN, SINCE THE RECALL WAS \"PERFORMED,\" EVEN THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IMPROPERLY, AS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE SECOND DEALER.  IN SUMMARY, THE CAR IS COVERED UNDER A GM WARRANTY AND THE PROBLEM DISABLING THE CAR IS THE SUBJECT OF A NHTSA RECALL, YET CHEVROLET REFUSES TO PROPERLY REPAIR THE CAR (AS CONFIRMED BY THEIR OWN DEALER) WITHOUT EXPENSE TO THE CUSTOMER. *JB",

ON TUESDAY 11/25/03 MY CAR'S STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT UNLOCK AFTER I INSERTED THE KEY INTO THE IGNITION.  THE CAR STARTED BUT THE STEERING WHEEL COULD NOT BE MOVED IN EITHER DIRECTION. SINCE I COULD NOT STEER THE CAR I HAD IT TOWED ABOUT 5 MILES TO HENDERSON CHEVROLET.  THEY SAID I HAD TWO CHOICES.  1) FOR $498 I COULD HAVE THE PROBLEM REPAIRED BUT THE REPLACED PARTS COULD FAIL CAUSING THE PROBLEM TO OCCUR AGAIN, OR 2) FOR $595 THE DEALER WOULD INSTALL A MECHANISM THAT WOULD RENDER THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK INOPERABLE.  I OPTED FOR OPTION 2.  ON WEDNESDAY 11/26/03, AFTER I PICKED UP MY CAR FROM HENDERSON CHEVROLET, I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT GM AND EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM.  GM SAID THEY WOULD CONTACT GM'S SERVICE MANAGER FOR MY AREA AND CALL ME BACK.  ON TUESDAY 12/2/03 GM CALLED ME.  I TOLD GM I HAD TO PAY $595 TO GET MY CAR \"REPAIRED.\"  THE LADY AT GM SAID SHE WOULD CALL GM'S AREA SERVICE MANAGER AGAIN AND THEN CONTACT ME ON FRIDAY 12/5/03.  I HAVE MY DOUBTS, BUT EVEN IF GM AGREES TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE $595 REPAIR BILL PLUS THE $32 RENTAL CAR COST, THE POINT IS THAT THERE'S A DEFECT IN THE CAR AND GM SEEMS UNABLE/UNWILLING TO FIX IT PROPERLY.  YOUR WEB SITE SHOWS A TSB FOR THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK THERE WAS A LIMITED RECALL DONE BY GM.  HENDERSON CHEVROLET PUT MY CAR'S VIN IN THEIR COMPUTER BUT THEY SAID MY CAR DID NOT MEET THE RECALL CRITERIA TO BE REPAIRED AT NO CHARGE.  IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE TO PAY ANY MONEY, LET ALONE $595, TO DISABLE MY CAR'S THEFT DETERRENT SYSTEM.  I WOULD LIKE GM/CHEVROLET TO FIX MY CAR, AT NO CHARGE, SO THAT THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK WORKS PROPERLY WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT A FUTURE FAILURE THAT MAKES STEERING IMPOSSIBLE. GM AND THEIR DEALERS ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.

THIS VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN FROM THE MANUFACTURERS PLANT IN BOWLING GREEN, KY TO LYMAN, SC, APPROXIMATELY 400 MILES, BY WAY OF NASHVILLE, TN. IT SAT IN THE GARAGE THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THE NEXT WEEKEND, THE BRAKES LOCKED UP. TAKEN TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, IT REMAINED THERE FOR TWO FULL WEEKS WHILE THEY REPAIRED THE ABS SYSTEM. WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP, THE SYSTEM AGAIN FAILED AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR WERE UNSUCCESSFULL. THE SECOND ATTEMPT REQUIRED PARTS THAT WERE TO BE BACK ORDERED. THE PARTS WERE LOCATED AT THE CORVETTE PLANT, HOWEVER, AND THE REPAIRS MADE. THE VEHICLES BRAKE SYSTEM NOW APPEARS TO BE NORMAL. THE LAST PART OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM, THE TIRES, HAVE NOT BEEN REPAIRED AT THIS TIME. ONLY A \"GOOD WILL OFFER\" OF $75  HAS BEEN OFFERED, TOWARDS THE COST OF $1600 WORTH OF TIRES, ON A $46,000 CAR. *AK",
