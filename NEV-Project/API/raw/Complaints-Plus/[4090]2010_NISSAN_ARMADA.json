I TOOK IT TO AN AUTHORIZED NISSAN SERVICE STATION, WHICH CHARGED ME $150 TO DIAGNOSE A CRACKED CATALYTIC CONVERTER EXHAUST MANIFOLD ON BOTH SIDES. THE REPAIR ESTIMATE WAS ABOUT $4,000 TO REPLACE THE MANIFOLDS AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 80K MILES AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH ARMADA AND TITAN MODELS. I SHOPPED AROUND FOR ESTIMATES AND HAD THE MANIFOLDS REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WITH AFTERMARKET PARTS FOR A TOTAL COST OF $2,100 WITH A 2-YEAR/24K MILES WARRANTY. IN 2020 AND AT 125K MILES (3 YEARS/30K MILES LATER), THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRED AND THE SHOP WOULD NOT EXTEND THE WARRANTY. THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THE REPAIR AT $5,000, AND THE INDEPENDENT SHOP ESTIMATES $1,900. ALL OF THE MECHANICS (INCLUDING THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP) HAVE ADVISED ME THAT THEY DON'T THINK THE CAR IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT AT 130K MILES CONSIDERING THE TRADE VALUE IS AROUND $5K. I CAN'T AFFORD THIS REPAIR TWICE IN 3 YEARS, AND I'M DRIVING MY FAMILY AROUND BREATHING IN CO FUMES THAT COULD HARM OR KILL US. I PRIMARILY USE THE VEHICLE FOR DAY-TO-DAY SUBURBAN DRIVING WITH OCCASIONAL CAMPING TRIPS - NO HARD OR OFF-ROAD USE. NISSAN SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND REIMBURSE THE COST OF REPAIRS AS THIS IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL ISSUE FOR DRIVERS. I AM NOW FACED WITH A DECISION TO INVEST ALMOST HALF THE VALUE OF MY VEHICLE IN A REPAIR THAT MAY FAIL AGAIN, OR TO BUY A NEW CAR I CAN'T CURRENTLY AFFORD IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.

IF THE AFFLICTED SYSTEMS WERE TO FAIL DURING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, OR EVEN SIMPLY IN POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS, IT COULD EASILY RESULT IN LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL RESULTING IN AN ACCIDENT.

IT ALSO SEEMS VERY LIKELY THAT MANY OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME MALFUNCTION AS WITH MY 2005 AND 2010 MODELS, BUT THAT THE NHTSA'S STATISTICS DO NOT TRACK SUCH COMPLAINTS PROBLEM BECAUSE THE FAULTY COMPONENT IS NOT YET 'UNSAFE' IN THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF MALFUNCTION.
