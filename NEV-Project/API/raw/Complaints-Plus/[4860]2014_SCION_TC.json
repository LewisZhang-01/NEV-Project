I WAS NOT DRIVING AND THERE WAS NO IMPACT THAT OCCURRED. THE EVENT WAS SPONTANEOUS AND HAPPENED OUT OF NOWHERE. BEING THAT I WAS STATIONARY THE GLASS IN THE MIDDLE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY FALL IN AND THE OUTSIDE EDGES HAD SHATTERED AND WHERE FORCEFULLY THROWN ON TO THE CAR AND SURROUNDING AREAS.

LUCKILY NO ONE WAS IN THE BACKSEAT WHEN THIS HAPPENED OUR DIRECTLY OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE AND WAS INJURED BY THIS. THROUGH FURTHER RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT TEMPERED GLASS CAN SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK. SOME OF THE CAUSES OF THIS TO HAPPEN INCLUDE BINDING OF THE GLASS IN THE FRAME, CAUSING STRESSES TO DEVELOP AS THE GLASS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS DUE TO THERMAL CHANGES OR DEFLECTS DUE TO WIND. INTERNAL DEFECTS WITHIN THE GLASS SUCH AS NICKEL SULFIDE INCLUSIONS. DAMAGES ACCRUED DURING INSTALLATION. THERMAL STRESSES IN THE GLASS AND INADEQUATE GLASS THICKNESS TO RESIST WIND LOAD. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER CLAIMS INCLUDING SCION TC'S AND THE MOONROOF BREAKING AND RISK OF SHOWERING GLASS ON TOP OF DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS. I WENT TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY WANT TO TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND HAVE PUSHED IT OFF TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY.
