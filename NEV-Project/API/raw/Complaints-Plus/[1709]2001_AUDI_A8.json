THE TIRE SIZE WAS EXACTLY AS RECOMMENDED ON THE B-PILLAR AND EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AS THE TIRES THAT WERE ON THE CAR WHEN THESE NEW TIRES WERE ORDERED. THE ONLINE AD FOR THE TIRES SPECIFICALLY STATED \"ASK US TO INSTALL\" [THE TIRES]. I HAD THEM SHIPPED TO THE WALMART ON QUEBEC AND E-470 IN ENGLEWOOD, COLORADO. WHEN THEY ARRIVED, \"TED\" THE ASSISTANT TIRE DEPARTMENT MANAGER, REFUSED TO MOUNT THEM AND REFUSED TO SELL ME ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE. I WENT TO THE MANAGER \"SAMANTHA\" TO COMPLAIN, BUT SHE  BACK UP TED SAYING THE COMPANY HAD A WRITTEN POLICY NOT TO INSTALL THE TIRES OR SELL ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE FOR THEM. WHEN I ASKED TO SEE THE POLICY SHE SAID THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WRITTEN POLICY WAS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE PUBLIC TO VIEW. I HAD TWO OF THE TIRES PUT ON BY AN INDEPENDENT TIRE COMPANY AND THE OTHER TWO BY ANOTHER WALMART WHO INDICATED THEY WOULD INSTALL THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE. ALMOST IMMEDIATLY, ONE OF THE TIRES WENT FLAT WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A CURVY ROAD [HWY 74 BETWEEN MORRISON AND EVERGREEN] AND RUINED THE TIRE. I DIDN'T SEE ANY NAILS OR PUNCTURES IN THE TIRE. PRETTY SOON TWO MORE OF THE TIRES DID THE SAME THING WHEN GOING AROUND A CORNER. FINALLY, I WAS DRIVING ON I-70 AT ABOUT 50 MILES PER HOUR BY THE CHIEF HOSA EXIT DRIVING WESTBOUND. THE ROADS WERE NOT SNOW PACKED BUT WERE ICY. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE RIGHT REAR TIRE LOST AIR, THE CAR DID A 360 AND ENDED UP IN A SLIGHT DITCH ON THE EXIT. IT DID $7000 PLUS DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END. I BELIEVE EITHER THE SIDEWALLS OR THE BEAD ARE FAULTY AND WHEN GOING ON A CURVE, THE BEAD SEPARATES FROM THE WHEEL CAUSING IT TO LEAK AND THEN QUICKLY DEFLATE.",
