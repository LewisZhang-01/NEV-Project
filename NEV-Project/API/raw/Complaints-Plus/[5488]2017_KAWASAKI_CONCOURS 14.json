THINKING IT WAS JUST PUT INTO SERVICE, I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT.  NOT THE CASE!  EACH DAY/RIDE IN THE FIRST THREE (3) DAYS OF OWNERSHIP, THE SEAT UNLATCHES ITSELF EVERY RIDE!  A QUICK ONLINE SEARCH SHOWED ME THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR YEARS.  I AM HERE TO SAY, IT IS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED AND NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED!!!",
