The clicking noise dramatically increases when the road is not smooth. It started since almost a month back. After doing some research I found that this seems to be a common problem on many Hyundai models. There are many youtube videos showing this same problem that I am facing in my car. Here is one such link from youtube, and its description section pointed me about the recall of this part. https://youtu.be/lrkARm38wfc  Hyundai had also issued a recall to change the steering coupler that seems to be faulty. The vehicles associated with the recall can be seen here https://autoservice.hyundaiusa.com/TXX7/MicroSiteTemplate/MicroSiteTemplateVINValidate/2689 It seems Hyundai is covering only Sonata and Elantra models. Since the same problem exists on Azera as well, I request you to please look into this matter as many folks had reported that the steering could fail to respond due to this issue. It is also a safety issue if the steering fails to respond while driving on the road on freeway.   I can understand that Hyundai might have not received so much complains as the number of cars sold for Sonata and Elanatra models is significantly higher compared to Azera model. But if this is a safety issue and if the same parts are used in Azera model, I believe the recall should apply for Azera as well.  The problem is easily reproducible. There is no warning lights or any messages or symptoms prior to failure.",

WHEN I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE THIRD TIME, THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM. THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS THE FUEL TANK EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING. THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED THAT IT'S LIKE SUCKING THE AIR OUT OF A COKE BOTTLE (CRINKLING NOISE) AND AFTERWARDS PUSHING AIR BACK IN FOR IT TO EXPAND, MAKING A THUMP LIKE NOISE. THE DEALER CLAIMS THERE IS NO SAFETY RISK TO THIS LOUD EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING OF THE GAS TANK AND GAS VAPORS. THE FIX IS TO REPLACE THE GAS TANK BUT AT MY OWN COST SINCE THERE IS NO TSB OR RECALL POSING A SAFETY RISK. I HAVE RESEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND SEVERAL OTHERS WITH THIS SAME EXPERIENCE.",

I HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE AGAIN SINCE THERE WERE VEHICLE APPROACHING BEHIND ME. I TRIED TO RESTART THE 3RD TIME, AND THE ENGINE STARTED UP WITH SOME HESITATION. AFTER MAKING SURE I COULD GET THE ENGINE TO REV UP TO MORE THAN 5KRPM, I PULL OUT AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR. NO ENGINE CHECK CODE WAS DISPLAYED.  *TR",
