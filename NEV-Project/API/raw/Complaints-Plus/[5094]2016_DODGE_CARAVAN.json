I TOOK IT BACK ON THE SAME DAY, AND WAS GIVEN ANOTHER RENTAL. THIS WAS IN OCTOBER. (PAPERWORK STATES: OCT 11 AND OCT 13.)  FRIDAY OCT 13 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO BRING BACK THE RENTAL. WHEN I ASKED IF MY VAN WAS FIXED I WAS TOLD, 'NO, BUT THE DEALERSHIP ISN'T GOING TO PAY FOR THE CAR RENTAL ANYMORE.' THE DEALERSHIP OPENED A STAR CASE FROM CORPORATE AND WERE TOLD TO CLOSE THE CASE, EVEN THOUGH NOTHING WAS FIXED. I RETURNED THE RENTAL AND PICKED UP MY VAN.
