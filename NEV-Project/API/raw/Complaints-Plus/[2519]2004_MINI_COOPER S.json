I HAD TO PULL OVER AND STOPPED THE CAR TO SEE WHAT'S WRONG. IT CAME BACK TO NORMAL AFTER I TURNED ON THE ENGINE. THE STEERING PROBLEM WOULD HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD DO THE SAME PROCEDURES AND THE STEERING WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL AGAIN. TODAY (3/27/13), WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT 35 MPH IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREA, I NOTICED MY STEERING WHEEL STIFFEN LIKE LAST TIME. I STOPPED AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND FIRED IT BACK UP. THIS TIME, IT STAYED STIFF PERMANENTLY. I HAD TO DRIVE THE CAR BACK HOME DURING RUSH HOURS. LUCKILY I MANAGED TO GET HOME WITHOUT GETTING INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. I CHECKED THE STEERING FLUID LEVEL UNDER THE HOOD AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS FULL. I GOOGLED THE STEERING PROBLEM ON THE 2004 MINI COOPER S, I CAME TO FIND OUT THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE EXPERIENCED BY MANY MINI OWNERS. I NEED YOUR ADVICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON HOW I CAN GET MY CAR REPAIRED BEFORE IT CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD. THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE TO MAKE A LIVING. BECAUSE OF THESE COMMON STEERING PROBLEMS, I HOPE MINI WOULD TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.   *TR",

I RETURNED CAREFULLY HOME AND LEFT THE CAR PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY UNTIL I COULD CONTACT MY LOCAL MINI DEALER (PRESTIGE MINI IN MAHWAH, NJ). WHEN I GOT INTO THE CAR TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER, THE POWER STEERING WAS SUDDENLY WORKING AGAIN. PRESTIGE MINI CLAIMS THAT MY STRUT TOWERS ($645) AND LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS (ALSO $645) WERE SHOT AND NEEDED REPLACING. THE ADVISOR TOLD ME VERBALLY THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND/OR THE POWER STEERING PUMP FAN, BUT SO FAR I CANNOT GET PRESTIGE TO REPLY VIA EMAIL (IN WRITING) THAT THIS IS TRUE.  *TR",

I DROVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TESTED THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND SAID THAT IT WAS GOOD AT THAT TIME. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM WITH JUST GIVING OUT AT RANDOM TIMES UNLESS I SPENT $4000 AND HAD ALL THE COMPONENTS REPLACED EVEN THOUGH IT TESTED GOOD AT THE TIME. THEY REPLACED ALL THE BUSHINGS AND STRUTS IN THE FRONT AT THAT TIME FOR $2000. THEY TOLD ME NOT TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING UNLESS IT TOTALLY STOPPED WORKING. THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS 5000 MILES LATER ON A ROUND ABOUT AT 35 MPH. THE STEERING HAD JUST FAILED AGAIN. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN THE DEALER TESTS THE SYSTEM AFTER A FAILURE AND CLAIMS THAT IT IS GOOD, AND THEN IT FAILS AGAIN WITH NO WARNING.

THOUGH I WAS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO COMPLETE THE TURN WITHOUT LEAVING THE ROAD BY USING ALL OF MY STRENGTH TO SLOWLY TURN THE WHEEL, MY CAR TRAVELED FOR APPROX. 1/2 BLOCK IN THE OPPOSING LANE OF TRAFFIC BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO STEER THE CAR BACK INTO MY LANE.

THE CRACKS SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THERMAL  INSTABILITY.  I.E. COLD OUTSIDE/HOT INSIDE ETC.  I PERSONALLY KNOW OF ONE 2003  MINI OWNER IN MA WHO HAS NOW HAD 6 WINDSHIELDS REPLACED SINCE PURCHASE.  THE MINI COMMUNITY HAS DETERMINED THAT AFTERMARKET US MADE GLASS BY PPG DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPENSITY FOR SUCH FAILURES.  I AM RELUCTANT TO CONTINUE GOING TO MY DEALER AS THIS PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURED OEM GLASS.  ON THE OTHER HAND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD WITH A NON OEM PRODUCT, OUT OF POCKET TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. FOR MUCH MORE INFORMATION, YOU CAN REFER TO THE MINI COOPER OWNERS INTERNET WEB FORUM \"NORTHAMERICANMOTORING .COM\"  THE DEFECT IS WIDE SPREAD FROM THE MINI'S INTRODUCTION IN '02 CONTINUING THROUGH TO '05 PRODUCTION MODELS.  TO FIND THIS INFORMATION, GO TO \"BENEATH THE BONNET\" AND USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER FOR \"CRACKED GLASS\".  YOUR ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF I CAN BE OF HELP.  SINCERELY,  MARK WILLIAMS CFP  *JB",
