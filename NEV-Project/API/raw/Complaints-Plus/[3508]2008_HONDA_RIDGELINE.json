THEY ALSO STATE, RED LETTERS!, THAT A PASSENGER SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS VEHICLE UNTIL THE AIR BAG PROBLEM IS FIXED. THE LETTERS ALSO STATE THAT IF THIS AIR BAG RECALL IS NOT ADDRESSED AND REPAIRED IN 60 DAYS FROM THE NOTICE, I MAY FILE A COMPLAINT. WELL, HERE IS MY COMPLAINT!!  NOW, I ASK AND NEED TO KNOW, THAT THIS AIR BAG PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE ADVISE WHAT I NEED TO DO TO REMEDY IT.  ONE, I CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO USE MY VEHICLE, PASSENGERS OR NO PASSENGERS.  TWO, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE NOW, WHEREAS IN THE PAST I DID BEFORE KNOWING THIS ABOUT THE AIR BAGS AND NOW IT IS DRAGGING OUT.  I NEED THIS FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WOULD YOU FEEL SAFE IN A RECALLED VEHICLE, WAITING FOR THE WORST TO HAPPEN???  AND KNOWING THAT IF THE WORST WERE TO HAPPEN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF IT WAS ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER???  AND WORST YET, IF AN ACCIDENT WERE TO OCCUR THAT OTHERWISE ONE WOULD WALK AWAY FROM, BUT INSTEAD WAS SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS AIR BAG PROBLEM, HOW CAN THE THIS BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE POWERS-THAT-BE IN THIS RECALL ARE DRAGGING THIS THING OUT.
