        "summary": "ON MY 6-MONTH OLD LANCE 2295 TRAILER, THE 45-GALLON, 400# POTABLE WATER HOLDING TANK FELL OFF IN THE ROAD. THE PLASTIC TANK ITSELF IS NOT BOLTED TO THE RIG, BUT SITS ON AN 0.18\" THICK BY 0.625\" WIDE RIM ON THE FORE AND AFT SIDES. A BOLT HOLDING THE REAR MOUNTING BRACKET TO THE CHASSIS (PHOTO 1) APPARENTLY CAME LOOSE OR SHEARED OFF AND FELL OFF. THESE BOLTS ARE ONLY 1/4\" DIAMETER 307A GENERAL SERVICE HARDWARE. THIS LOSS STRESSED ANOTHER MOUNTING BOLT, WHICH SHEARED OFF (PHOTOS 2A & 2B), ALLOWING THE MOUNTING BRACKET TO ROTATE (PHOTO 3) AFT FROM IT'S INTENDED POSITION (PHOTO 4) THE ROTATION WAS POSSIBLY DUE TO WATER MOVEMENT IN THE TANK. THERE IS NO BACKUP RESTRAINING SYSTEM, EITHER TO SUPPORT THE TANK OR PREVENT THE BRACKETS FROM ROTATING. SINCE THE TANK ITSELF IS NOT AFFIXED, IT SIMPLY FELL ONTO THE ROADWAY. VEHICLE WAS MOVING FORWARD AT 2-3 MPH ON A LEVEL PAVED SURFACE. THE TANK BECAME LODGED UNDER THE TRAILER AXLES AND HAD TO BE CUT FREE. THERE IS A SECOND, SIMILAR TANK (ALSO 45 GALLONS) FOR GRAY WATER STORAGE, ALSO USING THIS SAME SUPPORT SCHEME. THESE TANKS ARE ROUGHLY THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF A REFRIGERATOR. THE REAR (GRAY WATER) TANK IS AFT OF THE AXLES, SO THERE WOULD BE NOTHING AT ALL TO PREVENT A FOLLOWING VEHICLE FROM STRIKING IT. IN SUMMARY:  - OVERALL DESIGN OF TANK MOUNTING SYSTEM IS DEFICIENT AND DANGEROUS, WITH NO REDUNDANCY.  - MOUNTING BOLTS ARE UNDERSIZED AND OF LOW SHEAR STRENGTH.  - 400 LB TANK IS NOT PHYSICALLY FIXED THE MOUNTS, BUT SITS ON AN 0.18\" THICK BY 0.625\" WIDE PLASTIC FLANGE. ANY MOVEMENT OF TANK COULD ALLOW FLANGE TO FLEX AND FAIL.  - THERE ARE MULTIPLE TANKS WITH THE SAME MOUNTING SYSTEM.",
